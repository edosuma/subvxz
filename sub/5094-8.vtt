00:02.145 --> 00:06.397
Ella was
a sweet 18-year-old young woman.

00:07.799 --> 00:10.000
She was a straight-A student.

00:11.235 --> 00:13.169
She was working
as a cashier in that deli.

00:13.171 --> 00:14.270
You know why?

00:14.272 --> 00:17.207
To help her parents
with some extra money.

00:17.209 --> 00:19.843
She was viciously attacked
as she closed

00:19.845 --> 00:21.244
the shop.

00:21.246 --> 00:24.714
You just heard her
as she begged for her life,

00:24.716 --> 00:27.617
begged for help, begged
for mercy as he stabbed her

00:27.619 --> 00:30.153
not once...

00:30.155 --> 00:33.356
not twice...

00:33.358 --> 00:37.394
but eight times in the chest

00:37.396 --> 00:39.596
till she bled out.

00:44.635 --> 00:46.803
Were her cries in vain?

00:49.273 --> 00:51.441
That's up to you.

00:52.877 --> 00:54.844
And you.

00:56.714 --> 00:59.015
And you.

01:05.790 --> 01:07.023
(phone rings)

01:07.025 --> 01:09.325
JAMIE: You have the right
to consult with a lawyer

01:09.327 --> 01:11.361
and have that lawyer present
during questioning.

01:11.363 --> 01:12.829
If you can't afford a lawyer...
Hey.

01:12.831 --> 01:15.098
...one will be appointed for you.
Yeah, uh, we, we are, but I...

01:15.100 --> 01:16.066
Get in.

01:16.068 --> 01:18.935
I might be
delayed at work.

01:18.937 --> 01:19.969
(chuckles)

01:19.971 --> 01:22.572
I'll call you.

01:24.875 --> 01:26.876
You got a date?

01:28.712 --> 01:30.747
It's a hot guy
from my yoga class.

01:30.749 --> 01:32.515
Ugh, a granola cruncher?

01:32.517 --> 01:34.317
No, a commodities trader.

01:34.319 --> 01:35.819
Where are you going
on this first date?

01:35.821 --> 01:38.154
Well, nowhere now that
somebody decided to make

01:38.156 --> 01:41.024
a felony arrest ten minutes
before end of tour.

01:41.026 --> 01:42.725
Tell you what-- I'll take
the collar, do the paperwork.

01:42.727 --> 01:43.993
You can have the night off.

01:43.995 --> 01:45.328
Really?

01:45.330 --> 01:46.429
Really.

01:46.431 --> 01:49.499
Thanks.

01:53.971 --> 01:56.206
This guy know you're a cop?

01:56.208 --> 01:59.309
Come on, sport,
it's a real romance killer.

01:59.311 --> 02:01.945
But chicks like dating
cops, right?

02:01.947 --> 02:05.515
No, no, no, no,
chicks like dating firefighters.

02:05.517 --> 02:06.649
What?

02:06.651 --> 02:09.384
You ever see a beefcake calendar
with the NYPD?

02:09.387 --> 02:10.553
You don't.

02:11.422 --> 02:14.124
Maybe I'll start one.

02:19.430 --> 02:21.631
You know where that old lady
lived, you know,

02:21.633 --> 02:25.268
the one that wouldn't give back
the balls that went in her yard?

02:25.270 --> 02:27.670
And smoked the Tareytons.

02:27.672 --> 02:28.705
Yeah, that's her.

02:28.707 --> 02:31.508
Her house just went up
for $1.6 mil.

02:31.510 --> 02:32.775
Brooklyn has become

02:32.777 --> 02:34.010
the new Manhattan.

02:34.012 --> 02:36.179
Then, what's that
make Manhattan?

02:36.181 --> 02:38.281
I don't know, the new Hong Kong?

02:38.283 --> 02:39.482
(chuckles)

02:40.918 --> 02:42.852
Yeah, you got the last one.

02:42.854 --> 02:44.154
I won't argue with you.

02:44.156 --> 02:46.556
You make a lot more
than this civil servant.

02:46.558 --> 02:49.592
Hey, when you quit that job,
you can write your own ticket.

02:49.594 --> 02:52.595
At what, corporate security?

02:52.597 --> 02:55.565
Sounds like one of those
euphemisms your clients use.

02:55.567 --> 02:57.267
Hey, hey, hey, watch that.

02:57.269 --> 03:01.070
Riding a desk is nowhere
on my bucket list.

03:01.072 --> 03:03.139
What is on your bucket list,
Frank?

03:04.108 --> 03:07.177
Kicking your ass at poker
on a weekly basis.

03:07.179 --> 03:09.612
Well, that is never,
never going to happen.

03:10.748 --> 03:12.515
We'll see.

03:12.517 --> 03:15.685
MAN: <i>So, um, you know,</i>
<i>I'm skating along</i>

03:15.687 --> 03:16.986
and I hip-check this guy,

03:16.988 --> 03:19.155
and he goes flying
over the wall.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.858
(laughing): I know, and we,
we won the game.

03:21.860 --> 03:23.092
That's great.

03:23.094 --> 03:24.327
Yeah, it was awesome.

03:24.329 --> 03:25.828
You didn't learn
those moves on Wall Street.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.096
Never know.

03:27.098 --> 03:28.598
(both laugh)

03:28.600 --> 03:30.733
Uh, we play
down at Pier 62.

03:30.735 --> 03:32.302
You should come
watch me sometime.

03:32.304 --> 03:33.770
Yeah, okay.

03:33.772 --> 03:35.205
The place has
thinned out.

03:35.207 --> 03:39.108
You want to grab a table,
get so-- some dinner?

03:39.110 --> 03:41.844
Um...

03:41.846 --> 03:44.948
I would, but I, I got
to be in work early

03:44.950 --> 03:47.083
and I got a lot of stuff
to do before I hit the sack.

03:47.085 --> 03:49.252
Okay, that's fine.

03:49.254 --> 03:50.820
Oh, h-hang on, I can take...
No, no, no, no...

03:50.822 --> 03:53.356
Are you sure?
This is on me.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.390
There you go.

03:54.392 --> 03:55.491
Thanks, Jake.

03:55.493 --> 03:56.526
Yeah.

03:56.528 --> 03:57.660
I'll walk you home.

03:57.662 --> 03:59.829
Okay.

04:00.598 --> 04:02.665
MAN:
<i>Guilty,</i>

04:02.667 --> 04:06.302
guilty... guilty,

04:06.304 --> 04:11.407
guilty... guilty,
and guilty.

04:12.576 --> 04:15.278
So that's...

04:15.280 --> 04:17.213
Wait a second.

04:17.214 --> 04:20.350
That's only 11 guilties.

04:20.351 --> 04:21.483
Who didn't vote?

04:22.786 --> 04:24.787
(clears throat)

04:24.789 --> 04:26.656
That'd be me.

04:26.658 --> 04:28.558
You know, this is supposed
to be anonymous.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.760
Anonymity is overrated.

04:30.762 --> 04:32.762
(laughing):
Okay.

04:32.764 --> 04:35.064
Uh, so I take it we're
all in agreement here?

04:35.066 --> 04:37.867
(jurors affirming)

04:38.736 --> 04:41.437
All except one.

04:41.439 --> 04:43.339
(jurors groaning)

04:43.341 --> 04:46.376
All but one.

04:46.378 --> 04:48.745
(sighs)

04:48.747 --> 04:51.247
(engine starts)

04:51.249 --> 04:53.716
Friday night at Primo's, 8:00.

04:55.052 --> 04:56.986
I'll give you a shot
at that bucket list.

04:56.988 --> 04:59.989
And I'll kick your ass.

04:59.991 --> 05:02.792
Yeah, right.

05:02.794 --> 05:04.994
Never gonna happen.

05:12.369 --> 05:16.105
Look, see,
everything's fine.

05:17.308 --> 05:18.608
Thank you for the drink.

05:19.677 --> 05:22.745
W-Why don't I come in,
you make me a cup of coffee?

05:23.647 --> 05:25.581
I can't.

05:25.583 --> 05:28.151
(chuckles)
Okay.

05:28.153 --> 05:30.353
Well, thank you
for the lovely evening.

05:30.355 --> 05:32.121
Hey, Jake.

05:32.123 --> 05:34.157
Jake, you need to go home...
What's the matter? What are you doing?

05:34.159 --> 05:35.425
(grunts)

05:35.427 --> 05:37.293
Stop, come on.
No, no.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.195
Get in there.
No.

05:39.197 --> 05:40.897

He had two bullet wounds, was
hit in the shoulder and chest,

06:09.938 --> 06:12.405
but he is out of surgery
and stabilized.

06:12.407 --> 06:13.406
Prognosis?

06:13.408 --> 06:14.908
When he wakes up,
he will be moved

06:14.910 --> 06:17.310
from ICU
to a general floor.

06:17.312 --> 06:19.145
Good.

06:19.147 --> 06:22.015
Read it and weep.

06:22.017 --> 06:23.416
Does it say I shot him?

06:23.418 --> 06:24.751
Of course not.

06:24.753 --> 06:26.653
He's going to be
okay, by the way.

06:26.655 --> 06:30.357
Good, but people are going to
want to know why you're dining

06:30.359 --> 06:32.826
with the most notorious
mob lawyer in New York.

06:32.828 --> 06:35.061
Because I was hungry.
Who paid?

06:35.063 --> 06:36.663
Cut it out--
we grew up together.

06:36.665 --> 06:38.932
Well, then, why can't you just
send him a card at Christmas?

06:38.934 --> 06:40.634
And he's a lawyer,
not a mobster.

06:40.636 --> 06:41.668
I don't know many lawyers

06:41.670 --> 06:43.803
who get targeted for
a hit in Midtown.

06:43.805 --> 06:45.405
He works for
the acting head

06:45.407 --> 06:46.673
of the Rulanti crime family.

06:46.675 --> 06:48.041
That's how he makes his living.

06:48.043 --> 06:50.343
Frank, he's defending
Phil Romano.

06:50.345 --> 06:51.911
Baker, please notify me

06:51.913 --> 06:54.814
as soon as Mr. Gallo
regains consciousness.

06:54.816 --> 06:55.749
Yes, sir.

06:55.751 --> 06:56.950
I'm advising you not to get

06:56.952 --> 06:58.685
further involved with this.

06:59.553 --> 07:02.455
This how you treat your friends?

07:03.257 --> 07:05.525
(line ringing)

07:10.631 --> 07:14.267
Hey, Janko, boss said
you banged in sick today.

07:14.269 --> 07:15.702
I didn't hear from you,
you haven't returned my calls.

07:15.704 --> 07:17.771
Just want to make sure
you're okay.

07:17.773 --> 07:19.506
I'm gonna keep checking
on you till you answer.

07:19.508 --> 07:21.041
The necklace
was never recovered,

07:21.043 --> 07:23.276
the murder weapon was
never recovered.

07:23.278 --> 07:24.611
So what?
He ditched 'em.

07:24.613 --> 07:27.514
This case is
circumstantial at best.

07:27.516 --> 07:29.482
What are you talking
about, circumstantial?

07:29.484 --> 07:30.784
Just what I said.

07:30.786 --> 07:33.386
We heard from the
eyewitness Shania Costa.

07:33.388 --> 07:34.921
She saw the
whole thing.

07:34.923 --> 07:36.289
And she was convincing.

07:36.291 --> 07:37.590
Was she convincing?

07:37.592 --> 07:39.159
Okay.

07:39.161 --> 07:41.328
What color is the necktie
I'm wearing right now?

07:41.330 --> 07:42.028
What?

07:42.030 --> 07:43.029
What color is the tie

07:43.031 --> 07:44.731
that I have on right now?

07:44.733 --> 07:47.300
Red.

07:47.302 --> 07:50.303
Excuse me?

07:50.305 --> 07:52.172
Point taken.

07:52.174 --> 07:53.807
His prints were
all over the scene.

07:53.809 --> 07:56.209
He admitted to being there
earlier in the day.

07:56.211 --> 07:57.844
The D.A. thinks he did it.

07:57.846 --> 07:59.679
The D.A. didn't do
a good job of proving it.

07:59.681 --> 08:01.448
The detective from the case
thinks he did it.

08:01.450 --> 08:03.149
The grand jury thinks he did it.

08:03.151 --> 08:05.151
And I don't think he did it.

08:05.153 --> 08:08.221
ARBOGAST:
<i>We've got an uptick</i>

08:08.223 --> 08:11.024
of robberies in the 5-1,
year to date.

08:11.026 --> 08:13.526
We've got Anticrime
addressing it.

08:13.528 --> 08:16.796
Has OCCB picked up
any chatter on the wires

08:16.798 --> 08:17.997
about the Gallo hit?

08:17.999 --> 08:21.368
No, but they monitored
Gallo telling Romano

08:21.370 --> 08:23.303
that he's no longer
representing him.

08:27.942 --> 08:29.876
Really?

08:29.878 --> 08:32.479
They had to minimize, so we
don't know any more than that.

08:32.481 --> 08:34.780
Thank you, Dino.

08:40.821 --> 08:44.090
The D.A.'s office is
in the pretrial phase

08:44.092 --> 08:45.992
against Phil Romano, right?

08:45.994 --> 08:47.594
Charges include racketeering,

08:47.596 --> 08:50.063
murder, and
bid rigging.

08:50.065 --> 08:51.030
Case solid?

08:51.032 --> 08:52.565
Well, it was
until the key witness

08:52.567 --> 08:54.234
against Romano disappeared.

08:54.236 --> 08:57.504
According to the D.A.'s
office, if that witness

08:57.506 --> 08:59.739
doesn't surface,
they're going to be forced

08:59.741 --> 09:01.441
to make a plea deal with Romano.

09:01.443 --> 09:05.945
Gallo tells Romano he's not
going to represent him anymore.

09:05.947 --> 09:10.350
Romano would know that that ends
attorney-client privilege.

09:10.352 --> 09:12.852
Then he finds out
Gallo is meeting

09:12.854 --> 09:15.889
with the police commissioner.

09:15.891 --> 09:17.724
What do you think?

09:20.361 --> 09:22.562
Sounds like a motive.

09:28.035 --> 09:30.136
Sometimes a fresh set of eyes

09:30.138 --> 09:32.372
can make
a big difference in a case.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.275
I mean, look
at the crime scene photos.

09:35.277 --> 09:37.911
Look at all the blood
at the crime scene.

09:37.913 --> 09:39.312
Yet when DeShawn
Williams was arrested,

09:39.314 --> 09:41.614
he didn't have a trace
of blood on him,

09:41.616 --> 09:44.150
not on his clothes, not
on his shoes, nothing.

09:44.152 --> 09:46.019
It's because he got rid of them.

09:46.021 --> 09:48.588
He was arrested one hour
after the murder.

09:48.590 --> 09:50.990
How could he get rid
of all that blood

09:50.992 --> 09:52.459
that quickly?

09:52.461 --> 09:56.963
If you ask me, this looks a lot
more like a crime of passion.

09:57.832 --> 09:59.032
DeShawn Williams
had no connection

09:59.034 --> 10:01.701
to the victim prior,
which would eliminate him

10:01.703 --> 10:03.937
as a suspect
in a crime of passion.

10:03.939 --> 10:04.838
That's true.

10:04.840 --> 10:07.507
I mean, she was stabbed
eight times.

10:08.609 --> 10:11.211
I personally am not gonna
convict an 18-year-old kid

10:11.213 --> 10:14.247
solely on the testimony
of one eyewitness

10:14.249 --> 10:19.018
without one single piece of
physical evidence to support it.

10:19.020 --> 10:21.187
That's where I stand.

10:26.594 --> 10:28.561
I agree.

10:28.563 --> 10:29.929
What?

10:29.931 --> 10:31.898
I'm changing my vote.

10:31.900 --> 10:32.899
Not guilty.

10:32.901 --> 10:34.434
Anyone else?

10:37.538 --> 10:39.072
Okay.

10:39.074 --> 10:41.875
What is wrong with you people?

10:41.877 --> 10:44.878
And you. You're a cop.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.980
Your father's the police
commissioner, for God sakes.

10:46.982 --> 10:48.615
I think you should stop
right there.

10:48.617 --> 10:50.817
Your sister works
for the DA's office.

10:50.819 --> 10:53.253
Your entire family is
involved in law enforcement.

10:53.255 --> 10:54.387
You looked up my family?

10:54.389 --> 10:56.756
And you-- you went on a rally
just last year

10:56.758 --> 10:58.057
for tougher sentences

10:58.059 --> 10:59.559
for criminals
just like DeShawn Williams.

10:59.561 --> 11:00.960
All right, I think
it's time to shut your mouth.

11:00.962 --> 11:02.962
In order to cut down...
I think you should shut your mouth!

11:02.964 --> 11:04.898
And now you want us
to let this kid go?!

11:04.900 --> 11:07.166
I said, shut your mouth!
WOMAN: Stop it!

11:07.168 --> 11:09.802
Well, so much for impartiality.

11:09.804 --> 11:12.405
I'm getting the judge.

11:14.775 --> 11:17.076
(door creaks open)

11:17.078 --> 11:19.012
(door closes)

11:19.014 --> 11:22.448
Mr. Reagan, you accuse
Mr. Polaski of bias?

11:22.450 --> 11:23.683
No, I did not,
Your Honor.

11:23.685 --> 11:25.919
Clearly, he had a chip
on his shoulder and had it

11:25.921 --> 11:27.387
in for the defendant
from day one.

11:27.389 --> 11:29.923
Which is exactly
what bias is.

11:29.925 --> 11:33.459
And Mr. Polaski, I believe,
brought up personal information

11:33.461 --> 11:36.629
about your family's involvement
in law enforcement?

11:36.631 --> 11:37.730
Yes, but...

11:37.732 --> 11:39.465
Your Honor, the integrity

11:39.467 --> 11:41.467
of the jury has
been compromised.

11:41.469 --> 11:42.702
And given that,

11:42.704 --> 11:43.670
we don't believe

11:43.672 --> 11:45.071
my client can have a fair trial.

11:45.073 --> 11:46.639
No, no, no, no, no!
Mr. Reagan!

11:46.641 --> 11:48.107
Your Honor, we can
work this out.

11:48.109 --> 11:51.311
Mr. Reagan, one more outburst,
and you'll be in contempt.

11:51.313 --> 11:52.645
Please don't do this.

11:52.647 --> 11:54.814
Sit down... now!

11:59.820 --> 12:01.788
I'm going to declare a mistrial.

12:02.790 --> 12:05.124
The jurors will
all be released.

12:05.126 --> 12:06.926
A new date will be set.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.269
(sighs)

12:17.838 --> 12:20.273
Hey, Eddie,
can you please open up?

12:22.776 --> 12:25.378
JANKO:
I took a sick day.

12:25.380 --> 12:27.680
Why can't you just
leave me alone?

12:27.682 --> 12:29.115
I'm not feeling well.

12:29.117 --> 12:31.150
Open the door,
and I'll leave, okay?

12:31.152 --> 12:33.052
(metallic clinking)

12:33.054 --> 12:35.254
(clicking)

12:40.060 --> 12:42.929
Oh, my God, Eddie, what...

12:42.931 --> 12:45.164
what happened?

12:45.166 --> 12:48.468
I got in a car accident
on my way home.

12:48.470 --> 12:50.870
Did someone hit you?

12:50.872 --> 12:53.806
I got in a car accident.

12:53.808 --> 12:56.042
I don't think
that's what happened.

12:56.044 --> 13:00.213
Well, I don't really care
what you believe, Reagan.

13:00.215 --> 13:03.916
It's-it's none of your business,
so leave me alone.

13:05.000 --> 13:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:21.009 --> 13:24.178
(phone rings) MAN: Yeah, that's the guy
right there.

13:24.180 --> 13:25.979
Sarge, can I talk to you
for a second?

13:25.981 --> 13:28.048
I just got off the phone
with Detective Alvarez.

13:28.050 --> 13:30.718
The detective
in the DeShawn Williams case?

13:30.720 --> 13:33.354
Yeah, that's right. He wants to
know what your beef with him is.

13:33.356 --> 13:35.823
I don't have any beef with him.
I never even met the guy.

13:35.825 --> 13:37.424
But we had a weak
case, at best.

13:37.426 --> 13:40.394
Oh, you call an eyewitness
who identifies a kid

13:40.396 --> 13:41.962
with a rap sheet
and motive weak?

13:41.964 --> 13:43.497
Plus, his prints
at the scene?

13:43.499 --> 13:44.898
Come on, the kid admitted

13:44.900 --> 13:47.034
that he was in the store
earlier in the day.

13:47.036 --> 13:48.402
Yeah, shoplifting. Nice kid.

13:48.404 --> 13:49.937
There you go.
Knock yourself out.

13:49.939 --> 13:52.439
What is this?
The DeShawn Williams case.

13:52.441 --> 13:53.540
Really?
Yeah.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.409
You think the detectives
got it all wrong,

13:55.411 --> 13:56.677
you solve it.

13:56.679 --> 13:58.245
DeShawn Williams didn't do it.

13:58.247 --> 14:00.280
Great, Reagan. Then prove it,

14:00.282 --> 14:03.083
'cause he's scheduled
for a new trial in two weeks,

14:03.085 --> 14:05.052
and I'm damn sure
there won't be

14:05.054 --> 14:06.587
a detective Reagan
on the jury,

14:06.589 --> 14:09.056
because, thankfully,
there's only one of those.

14:17.499 --> 14:18.932
As you were.

14:29.511 --> 14:31.712
Frank.

14:33.548 --> 14:35.549
Mozzarella

14:35.551 --> 14:38.585
and prosciutto on foccacia
with roasted peppers.

14:38.587 --> 14:40.854
Tiramisu, cappuccino.

14:40.856 --> 14:42.256
From Di Palo's.

14:42.258 --> 14:44.525
They said it was your usual.

14:44.527 --> 14:48.028
Yeah. Well, did they say
it was, uh, unusual

14:48.030 --> 14:50.731
for NYPD's picking up
my lunch for me?

14:51.566 --> 14:53.867
Talk to me, Ange.

14:53.869 --> 14:55.536
Talk to you.

14:55.538 --> 14:57.638
Uh, there's a nurse
on the night shift.

14:57.640 --> 14:59.440
You got to see her, Frank.

14:59.442 --> 15:00.574
(laughs)

15:00.576 --> 15:02.543
About the hit.

15:04.345 --> 15:06.280
About the hit. I don't know.

15:06.282 --> 15:09.316
Probably some random
gang initiation, you know,

15:09.318 --> 15:11.952
or something along those lines.

15:12.787 --> 15:15.289
You have a tell, Ange.

15:16.357 --> 15:18.592
You play with your ring.

15:20.862 --> 15:22.296
What do you know

15:22.298 --> 15:25.199
about the witness
against Romano that disappeared?

15:25.201 --> 15:27.468
You talk to me like you don't
know how this works, Frank.

15:27.470 --> 15:29.403
Then, why'd you bail
as his lawyer?

15:29.405 --> 15:31.171
How do you know that?

15:32.874 --> 15:36.510
It's none of your business.

15:36.512 --> 15:38.445
It is now.

15:38.447 --> 15:40.447
Frank, please, don't push it.

15:40.449 --> 15:43.016
You need to tell me
what's going on, Angelo,

15:43.018 --> 15:45.619
or next time,
you're not gonna be so lucky.

15:47.088 --> 15:49.223
I'm not a rat.

15:49.225 --> 15:51.124
You're not a fool, either.

15:54.329 --> 15:57.598
Only a fool protects a guy
who tried to kill him.

16:00.201 --> 16:03.704
(sighs)

16:03.706 --> 16:05.906
(horn toots)

16:08.676 --> 16:09.943
WOMAN:
I'll be right upstairs.

16:09.945 --> 16:11.144
I'll meet you, okay?

16:11.146 --> 16:13.747
(phone rings and buzzes)

16:13.749 --> 16:15.249
Central, show us 98.

16:15.251 --> 16:18.452
CENTRAL:
Ten-four, 12-David.

16:20.088 --> 16:21.655
Been working an
hour and a half now,

16:21.657 --> 16:23.824
and you haven't
said two words.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.660
(phone rings and buzzes)

16:26.662 --> 16:27.895
(beep)

16:27.897 --> 16:29.863
I don't feel like talking.

16:33.167 --> 16:36.370
You want to tell me about
that date the other night?

16:36.372 --> 16:38.372
Who was he, Eddie?

16:38.374 --> 16:40.574
Some guy.

16:40.576 --> 16:42.409
You need to lay off
the questions.

16:42.411 --> 16:44.244
Maybe if I was
getting some answers.

16:44.246 --> 16:45.679
You are my partner at work.

16:45.681 --> 16:47.648
That doesn't make
my personal fair game.

16:49.083 --> 16:52.853
Okay, you want to get
something to eat... partner?

16:52.855 --> 16:54.421
Sure.

16:54.423 --> 16:55.722
I'll stay with the car.

16:55.724 --> 16:58.258
Turkey on a roll.

17:15.910 --> 17:18.579
(birds singing)

17:26.788 --> 17:29.856
So, how has everyone's
week been?

17:29.858 --> 17:31.124
Good. (clears throat)

17:31.126 --> 17:33.193
Yeah.

17:34.963 --> 17:37.130
Would someone mind telling us
what's going on?

17:37.132 --> 17:38.599
Why is everyone so quiet?

17:41.402 --> 17:43.070
Well, I got jury duty.

17:43.072 --> 17:45.172
Yeah, I heard
there was a mistrial.

17:45.174 --> 17:47.107
I can't talk about it.

17:47.109 --> 17:49.109
How about you, Dad?

17:49.111 --> 17:51.878
I saw on TV
that Angelo Gallo was shot.

17:53.081 --> 17:55.115
I can't talk about it.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.283
(chuckles)

17:56.285 --> 17:59.620
Jamie, got anything
you can't talk about?

17:59.622 --> 18:01.922
As a matter of fact...

18:01.924 --> 18:04.157
a friend of mine got herself
into some trouble,

18:04.159 --> 18:05.892
and I want to help her out,

18:05.894 --> 18:08.028
but she won't tell me exactly

18:08.030 --> 18:11.131
what's going on, and
I'm not sure how hard to push.

18:11.133 --> 18:12.866
I can relate.

18:12.868 --> 18:16.470
Any advice?

18:18.339 --> 18:20.040
I don't know.

18:20.042 --> 18:21.975
In my case, I'm thinking,

18:21.977 --> 18:24.911
if I can get past the fear
of losing a friendship,

18:24.913 --> 18:26.847
I'll know what to do.

18:26.849 --> 18:29.583
Anyone else got something
they don't want to talk about?

18:29.585 --> 18:31.852
Hey, I got something
I can talk about.

18:33.154 --> 18:34.454
I got a tattoo.

18:39.127 --> 18:40.327
Excuse me?

18:40.329 --> 18:41.528
(laughs)
I'm kidding!

18:41.530 --> 18:42.663
(laughs)

18:42.665 --> 18:44.097
I think we should go back

18:44.099 --> 18:45.565
to when we weren't talking
about anything.

18:45.567 --> 18:47.534
Don't even think about it.

18:47.536 --> 18:50.137
(laughter)

18:53.007 --> 18:54.374
You have no alibi.

18:54.376 --> 18:55.742
I have an alibi!

18:55.744 --> 18:57.044
I was at home.

18:57.046 --> 18:59.046
At home... alone
with no one to verify.

18:59.048 --> 19:00.647
You don't even got
a phone record.

19:00.649 --> 19:03.083
Why do I have to prove
to you where I was?

19:03.085 --> 19:05.652
Is it because I'm black?

19:05.654 --> 19:07.621
It's not about that,
and you know it.

19:07.623 --> 19:09.289
No?

19:09.857 --> 19:11.391
Well, all I know is

19:11.393 --> 19:15.228
that I'm on trial for murder,
and I didn't do it.

19:15.230 --> 19:17.698
And I can't get a single person
to believe me.

19:17.700 --> 19:19.499
I believed you!

19:19.501 --> 19:21.134
Well, then, you screwed me,

19:21.136 --> 19:22.903
because now I got

19:22.905 --> 19:24.705
a new jury
that'll be glaring at me

19:24.707 --> 19:27.874
every time the DA's office
shows them an autopsy photo,

19:27.876 --> 19:30.477
or plays that damn tape.

19:30.479 --> 19:33.714
If you want my help,
you have to help me.

19:33.716 --> 19:36.683
You got to give me something
that I can work with.

19:36.685 --> 19:39.586
I wish I could!

19:42.190 --> 19:45.292
Do you have any idea
what it is like

19:45.294 --> 19:48.095
to have your mother
sitting behind you in court,

19:48.097 --> 19:51.865
listening to all this stuff?

19:51.867 --> 19:56.503
Listening to everything
that they say I did?

19:57.338 --> 19:59.539
No.

20:00.742 --> 20:02.709
No, I don't.

20:02.711 --> 20:04.544
But what about this witness,

20:04.546 --> 20:06.046
Shania Costa?

20:06.048 --> 20:07.714
Hmm? Do you know her?

20:07.716 --> 20:11.151
I seen her
around the neighborhood.

20:11.153 --> 20:13.386
I didn't ask you if you saw her
around the neighborhood.

20:13.388 --> 20:15.055
I said, do you know her?
No.

20:15.057 --> 20:15.789
You don't know her at all?

20:15.791 --> 20:16.857
No!

20:17.992 --> 20:20.861
You think you're the only person
alone in this?!

20:21.996 --> 20:23.063
'Cause you're not!

20:23.065 --> 20:24.531
Do you know what it feels like

20:24.533 --> 20:26.767
to have every cop in this city
look at you

20:26.769 --> 20:28.068
like you're a crazy person

20:28.070 --> 20:30.737
for trying to help you?

20:30.739 --> 20:33.340
And you won't even help
yourself.

20:33.342 --> 20:35.776
Here's another question.

20:35.778 --> 20:38.178
Why the hell would that girl
pick you?

20:38.180 --> 20:40.547
Of all people, why you?

20:42.383 --> 20:44.584
Maybe you should ask her.

20:52.326 --> 20:54.361
(indistinct chatter)

21:22.490 --> 21:24.691
(sighs)

21:24.693 --> 21:25.926
Detective Black.

21:25.928 --> 21:27.861
Hi, this is Officer Reagan
out of the 12.

21:27.863 --> 21:29.462
I'm looking for some information
on an arrest

21:29.464 --> 21:31.498
that you made back in August.

21:31.500 --> 21:35.068
The perp is Jake Singer.
It was a rape collar.

21:47.541 --> 21:50.409
Shania, we'd like you
to take a look at these photos,

21:50.411 --> 21:52.477
see if any
of these men resemble the guy

21:52.479 --> 21:55.280
that you saw kill Ella Martin,
okay?

21:55.282 --> 21:57.249
Has DeShawn been cleared?

21:57.251 --> 21:58.650
No.

21:58.652 --> 22:02.120
We're just, uh, taking
another look at the case.

22:02.122 --> 22:04.523
I'm sorry. No.

22:04.525 --> 22:06.391
I don't recognize any of them.

22:06.393 --> 22:09.061
How sure are you
that it was DeShawn Williams?

22:09.063 --> 22:11.463
You don't see someone getting
stabbed every day.

22:11.465 --> 22:13.031
I'll never forget it.

22:13.033 --> 22:15.200
Why don't you tell us
what happened.

22:15.202 --> 22:19.471
I was inside the Laundromat
across the street.

22:19.473 --> 22:20.939
Where exactly?

22:20.941 --> 22:23.408
Just inside the front window.

22:23.410 --> 22:27.012
And she was screaming "please,
please," begging for her life,

22:27.014 --> 22:28.313
and he wouldn't stop.

22:28.315 --> 22:30.248
Shania...

22:30.250 --> 22:32.451
are you telling us
that you actually saw

22:32.453 --> 22:34.686
DeShawn Williams
stab Ella Martin?

22:34.688 --> 22:36.855
Yes, I did.

22:40.626 --> 22:44.129
(quietly):
Okay.

22:44.131 --> 22:46.231
Stop asking me
how I'm feeling, please.

22:46.233 --> 22:49.101
I was gonna say
you look like crap.

22:49.103 --> 22:52.170
Yeah, well, they won't let
my manicurist up here.

22:52.172 --> 22:53.972
Can you believe that?

22:53.974 --> 22:56.308
(sighs)

22:56.310 --> 22:57.709
What?

22:57.711 --> 22:59.978
I know that look.

22:59.980 --> 23:02.481
I didn't like it when we were
kids and I don't like it now.

23:02.483 --> 23:04.182
Too bad.

23:04.184 --> 23:07.853
Frank, everybody's entitled
to legal representation.

23:07.855 --> 23:10.322
You didn't have
to take on mob guys.

23:10.324 --> 23:13.291
Did I know
Romano was doing illegal things?

23:13.293 --> 23:14.793
Sure, I did.

23:14.795 --> 23:16.995
But he's still entitled
to a defense.

23:16.997 --> 23:20.232
And to a kid from Bay Ridge,
I liked the challenge.

23:20.234 --> 23:21.700
And the money.

23:21.702 --> 23:23.969
Yes, and the money, too, Frank.

23:23.971 --> 23:25.504
This is America

23:25.506 --> 23:28.240
and, last I heard, it's okay
to like the money.

23:28.242 --> 23:30.142
But that doesn't make me
one of them.

23:30.144 --> 23:31.510
I didn't say you were.

23:31.512 --> 23:33.712
Yeah. You
didn't have to.

23:33.714 --> 23:37.983
Those eyebrows of yours got
their own language.

23:37.985 --> 23:40.986
(sighs)

23:40.988 --> 23:44.556
What's your legacy gonna be,
Ange?

23:44.558 --> 23:48.393
What are your kids and grandkids
gonna brag on?

23:49.262 --> 23:51.463
I'm a great lawyer, Frank.

23:51.465 --> 23:53.431
I'm good at what I do.

23:53.433 --> 23:56.268
You could be too good
at the wrong thing.

23:56.270 --> 23:59.404
Yeah. And where's that line?

23:59.406 --> 24:02.774
It's one thing
to know Romano's a criminal.

24:02.776 --> 24:06.244
It's another to become complicit
in his crimes.

24:06.246 --> 24:08.914
And you're not just
betraying the law.

24:08.916 --> 24:13.385
You're betraying the values
your pop drummed into you.

24:13.387 --> 24:14.853
Yeah, well,

24:14.855 --> 24:17.756
I seen PD many times
cross the line

24:17.758 --> 24:19.691
in order to snag Romano.

24:19.693 --> 24:22.894
Is that what you're telling
yourself to make it okay?

24:23.796 --> 24:26.731
Frank, let's be honest.

24:26.733 --> 24:29.869
There are no saints
in this room.

24:29.870 --> 24:31.437
Agreed?

24:34.307 --> 24:36.241
Agreed.

24:36.243 --> 24:38.711
(sighs)
All right, Frank.

24:38.713 --> 24:40.946
Here's how it's gonna be.

24:40.948 --> 24:43.148
I want no DAs,

24:43.150 --> 24:46.618
no detectives
and no recording devices.

24:46.620 --> 24:49.221
Okay.

24:49.223 --> 24:52.291
I don't want
to get whacked, Frank.

24:54.461 --> 24:56.261
I am not leaving this earth

24:56.263 --> 24:59.164
until I dance with my daughter
at her wedding.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.235
The only thing I can promise

25:03.237 --> 25:06.538
is my best efforts to keep you
from testifying

25:06.540 --> 25:09.074
in a public courtroom.

25:09.076 --> 25:10.909
Well, your best efforts
are better

25:10.911 --> 25:12.578
than most people's end game.

25:13.613 --> 25:15.447
I trust you, Frankie.

25:18.351 --> 25:20.886
Shut the door and turn up
your hearing aid.

25:20.888 --> 25:22.788
(chuckles)

25:29.696 --> 25:32.164
So, the eyewitness Shania

25:32.166 --> 25:34.600
says she would've been standing
right around here

25:34.602 --> 25:37.202
when she saw DeShawn
Williams kill Ella Martin.

25:37.204 --> 25:38.270
Way over there.

25:38.272 --> 25:40.572
The view's a bit
obstructed.

25:40.574 --> 25:43.275
Yeah, and the street light's
busted in front of the bodega.

25:45.278 --> 25:46.812
That's over 200 feet away.

25:46.814 --> 25:48.814
Exactly.
Didn't his lawyer point that out?

25:48.816 --> 25:50.215
Nope.

25:50.217 --> 25:52.017
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

25:52.019 --> 25:53.685
Yeah, I'm Detective Reagan.

25:53.687 --> 25:55.354
This is my partner
Detective Baez.

25:55.356 --> 25:57.556
The street lamp in front
of the bodega over there,

25:57.558 --> 25:58.724
how long has it been out?

25:58.726 --> 26:00.025
Almost a year.

26:00.027 --> 26:02.728
Really?
I called 311, but they don't come.

26:02.730 --> 26:04.430
I called four times already.

26:04.432 --> 26:06.031
Were you working the night
of the murder,

26:06.033 --> 26:08.033
the young woman got stabbed
at the corner?

26:08.035 --> 26:09.468
I was in the back.
I didn't see it.

26:09.470 --> 26:11.003
But that's a very bad corner.

26:11.005 --> 26:12.237
How so?

26:13.273 --> 26:16.175
There's a young man sells drugs
on that corner.

26:16.177 --> 26:19.478
Really? This young man,
he have a name?

26:19.480 --> 26:21.680
I know he was arrested once,

26:21.682 --> 26:24.416
but then he was back again
the next week.

26:28.054 --> 26:30.055
Thanks.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.528
(phone ringing)

26:39.532 --> 26:41.500
(ringing stops)

26:41.502 --> 26:44.069
The guy you went on a date with,
he ever call you again?

26:44.071 --> 26:46.238
That's none of your business.

26:49.909 --> 26:52.945
It may not be my business,
but I'm gonna make it mine.

26:54.614 --> 26:57.816
If something happened to you,
Eddie, you need to report it.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.555
If he hit you
or he assaulted you in any way,

27:03.557 --> 27:05.557
you need to report it because,
if you don't, he's gonna

27:05.559 --> 27:07.759
do it
to someone else.

27:09.496 --> 27:12.631
You want me to walk
into this precinct

27:12.633 --> 27:15.000
and announce that...

27:15.002 --> 27:17.402
some guy sexually assaulted me?

27:17.404 --> 27:20.105
You don't think every guy
in this place will secretly

27:20.107 --> 27:21.740
be thinking, "She
shouldn't be a cop.

27:21.742 --> 27:23.909
She can't even
defend herself."

27:26.646 --> 27:28.981
I won't be thinking that.

27:28.983 --> 27:31.717
A lot of people
won't be thinking that.

27:31.719 --> 27:34.920
You know, it's bad enough that I
constantly have to prove myself.

27:34.922 --> 27:36.922
I know there are guys in here

27:36.924 --> 27:39.992
who don't even think
I should have this job.

27:39.994 --> 27:43.128
And you want me to admit
that this guy punched me

27:43.130 --> 27:45.430
and hit me

27:45.432 --> 27:47.933
and he groped me?

27:47.935 --> 27:51.303
It took every bit of me
to get away from him.

27:51.305 --> 27:53.171
And do you know what I did?

27:54.374 --> 27:57.342
I ran into the bathroom,
I locked the door.

27:57.344 --> 28:00.479
I hid like a little girl.

28:00.481 --> 28:02.981
I stayed in there all night.

28:03.850 --> 28:05.984
I'm sorry, Eddie.

28:07.520 --> 28:10.088
I want to forget about this.

28:10.090 --> 28:13.492
Will you please
not bring it up again?

28:17.730 --> 28:21.466
He was accused of rape
in the past.

28:22.402 --> 28:24.136
How do you know?

28:26.072 --> 28:28.173
I got his number out
of your phone

28:28.175 --> 28:29.875
and I ran it through the system.

28:29.877 --> 28:31.443
The charges were dropped.

28:31.445 --> 28:34.713
You did what?

28:34.715 --> 28:36.448
I'm trying to help you, Eddie.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.819
I don't want your help.

28:40.821 --> 28:42.354
I don't need it.

28:42.356 --> 28:44.823
And if you bring this up again,
I'm gonna report you

28:44.825 --> 28:47.225
for unauthorized use
of a police computer.

28:55.735 --> 28:58.670
There was an arrest on that
corner in March of last year,

28:58.672 --> 28:59.905
possession of cocaine.

28:59.907 --> 29:01.974
A... Jose Otero.

29:01.976 --> 29:03.542
Wasn't in the case file.

29:03.544 --> 29:05.210
Well, maybe no one
questioned him.

29:05.212 --> 29:09.147
But according to this,
he had 25 grams on him.

29:09.149 --> 29:10.415
So intent to sell.

29:10.417 --> 29:12.517
That doesn't explain his beef
with Ella Martin,

29:12.519 --> 29:14.186
unless, of course,
he thinks it was her

29:14.188 --> 29:15.954
that called the cops on him.
Was he sentenced?

29:15.956 --> 29:17.789
He was arraigned
and given bail.

29:17.791 --> 29:19.424
Bail? Who paid his bail?

29:19.426 --> 29:22.761
Our witness, Shania Costa.

29:22.763 --> 29:24.930
(sighs)

29:53.192 --> 29:53.925
Hey.

29:53.927 --> 29:55.093
Whoa. What...

29:55.095 --> 29:56.228
what are you doing here?

29:56.230 --> 29:57.462
I could ask you the same thing.

29:57.464 --> 29:59.364
This is getting really annoying,
Reagan.

30:01.567 --> 30:03.669
Do you really think
you can make this better

30:03.671 --> 30:05.237
with a little bit
of street justice?

30:05.239 --> 30:07.039
Maybe this isn't
about making things better.

30:07.041 --> 30:09.241
Maybe this is
about evening the score.

30:09.243 --> 30:11.510
Hey. If the job finds out
about this

30:11.512 --> 30:14.479
or he makes a complaint,
you're done.

30:14.481 --> 30:15.847
After what he did to me?

30:15.849 --> 30:17.449
Listen, it won't be
about what he did.

30:17.451 --> 30:19.051
It'll become about what you did.

30:20.353 --> 30:22.421
This is not the way
to get this guy.

30:23.289 --> 30:26.258
I can't be seen as a victim.

30:26.260 --> 30:28.894
If you stand up for yourself,
you won't be seen as a victim.

30:28.896 --> 30:30.796
(sobs)

30:30.798 --> 30:32.731
I can't.

30:32.733 --> 30:35.901
Yes, you can.

30:35.903 --> 30:38.770
(whispers):
It's humiliating.

30:38.772 --> 30:41.506
You won't be alone.

30:55.017 --> 30:57.185
Sit tight, Otero.

30:57.187 --> 30:58.787
Keep an eye on him.

30:58.789 --> 31:00.756
Reagan,
what's going on?

31:00.758 --> 31:02.657
I still can't make a
connection between Ella Martin

31:02.659 --> 31:03.959
and the other two.

31:03.961 --> 31:05.160
What about the drugs?

31:05.162 --> 31:07.863
Otero was definitely selling
drugs on that corner.

31:07.865 --> 31:09.865
It's possible Ella
Martin flipped on him,

31:09.867 --> 31:11.833
which gives him motive,
but I can't find a trail

31:11.835 --> 31:13.402
and this kid is not cooperating.
Mmm.

31:13.404 --> 31:15.303
I think we're gonna
need a search warrant

31:15.305 --> 31:17.839
for his apartment, Sarge.

31:17.841 --> 31:19.174
I'll work on it.

31:20.943 --> 31:22.978
Is Shania
cooperating?

31:22.980 --> 31:25.847
She claims she didn't know Ella
and never set foot in the deli.

31:25.849 --> 31:27.883
Yeah.
Maybe they're covering for each other.

31:28.851 --> 31:31.153
I got an idea.

31:31.155 --> 31:32.954
Go for it.

31:40.730 --> 31:41.963
Is that him?

31:41.965 --> 31:43.265
Yeah.

31:43.267 --> 31:45.367
Ready?

31:45.369 --> 31:47.068
Yeah.

31:47.937 --> 31:49.538
Jake Singer.

31:53.576 --> 31:55.477
You're a cop?

31:55.479 --> 31:57.212
Yeah, and I'm gonna arrest you.

31:57.214 --> 31:59.247
(chuckles)

31:59.249 --> 32:01.349
Uh, what are you talking about?

32:01.351 --> 32:03.819
Get up, on your feet.
Hands behind your back.

32:04.554 --> 32:06.421
Get him up.
Get up.

32:11.861 --> 32:13.528
(clears throat softly)

32:13.530 --> 32:14.930
Turn around.

32:14.932 --> 32:16.231
(laughs softly)

32:16.233 --> 32:19.768
Turn around.
Come on.

32:22.038 --> 32:24.039
(people gasp)
(grunts)

32:24.041 --> 32:26.107
And now I'm gonna add
resisting arrest.

32:26.109 --> 32:27.843
(chuckles)

32:27.845 --> 32:29.244
What's going on?

32:29.246 --> 32:30.579
Jake Singer,
you're under arrest

32:30.581 --> 32:32.447
for sexual abuse
in the first degree,

32:32.449 --> 32:35.317
and assault in
the second. Get up.

32:35.319 --> 32:36.651
Sexual assault?

32:36.653 --> 32:39.454
Yeah, this is all
a misunderstanding.

32:39.456 --> 32:43.124
Hey, he attacked me because
I wouldn't have sex with him.

32:43.126 --> 32:45.694
Consider yourself lucky.

32:55.705 --> 32:57.772
ARBOGAST:
<i>Just like you said,</i>

32:57.774 --> 32:59.908
the body of Gerry White,
the witness against Romano,

32:59.910 --> 33:02.777
was found in a shallow
grave in Great Kills.

33:02.779 --> 33:05.247
What about Crime Scene
and the M.E.'s office?

33:05.249 --> 33:07.215
En route.
Good.

33:07.217 --> 33:10.252
The D.A.'s office can add murder
to Romano's list of charges.

33:10.254 --> 33:12.254
And under federal guidelines,
he can be charged

33:12.256 --> 33:14.856
with conspiracy if he ordered
the hit on the witness.

33:14.858 --> 33:17.058
Romano not only ordered the hit,

33:17.060 --> 33:20.962
he supplied the victim's address
and personal information.

33:22.064 --> 33:25.433
Here is the shooter's
name and address.

33:25.435 --> 33:29.437
If you'll permit me, sir,
how do you know this?

33:29.439 --> 33:32.707
I'm the police commissioner--
I know everything.

33:32.709 --> 33:34.876
OCID has been putting
all of their resources

33:34.878 --> 33:37.379
into figuring out
who killed the witness...

33:37.381 --> 33:39.314
and they came up empty.

33:41.884 --> 33:43.852
Thank you, Dino.

33:50.026 --> 33:54.596
Just so you don't get caught
with your foot in your mouth,

33:54.598 --> 33:58.333
I'm asking the D.A.'s office
to charge Angelo Gallo

33:58.335 --> 34:00.268
with hindering prosecution

34:00.270 --> 34:03.805
for his refusal to cooperate
in the investigation.

34:05.174 --> 34:07.242
Your good friend?

34:07.244 --> 34:08.777
I don't care who he is,

34:08.779 --> 34:11.612
or how well I know him,
I want him arraigned,

34:11.614 --> 34:13.982
in his hospital room
if we have to.

34:13.984 --> 34:16.518
And I want to see it
on tonight's news.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.085
Perp walk?
The whole thing?

34:18.088 --> 34:20.388
I'm not shying away
from publicity here.

34:21.623 --> 34:23.891
Let's hold a press conference
first thing tomorrow,

34:23.893 --> 34:25.726
full-on victory lap.

34:25.728 --> 34:27.027
And that's that.

34:27.030 --> 34:28.228
Frank...

34:28.231 --> 34:30.532
Get to work.

34:36.973 --> 34:38.773
(sighs)

34:40.309 --> 34:42.510
All right, Otero, you understand
you got two strikes against you.

34:42.512 --> 34:45.213
If I find out you had anything
to do with that girl's death,

34:45.215 --> 34:47.248
even if you just lied
to protect your girlfriend,

34:47.250 --> 34:48.882
you're gonna get
locked up for a long time.

34:48.885 --> 34:51.018
Go on, sit down.

34:54.056 --> 34:56.190
I want you to write down
that you have no idea

34:56.193 --> 34:58.326
who killed Ella Martin.
And I want you to write down

34:58.328 --> 35:00.128
where you were
at the time of her death,

35:00.130 --> 35:01.963
and I want you to write down
every detail,

35:01.965 --> 35:03.665
everything you did
that entire day.

35:03.667 --> 35:06.067
Wait, you want me to write down
that I don't know anything?

35:06.069 --> 35:07.369
You don't know anything, right?

35:08.104 --> 35:10.305
Okay. Write it down.

35:10.307 --> 35:12.107
Go on.

35:18.748 --> 35:20.615
(sighs)

35:24.286 --> 35:26.921
Sorry to tell you,
but Jose flipped on you.

35:28.958 --> 35:31.059
He's writing out his statement
as we speak.

35:31.061 --> 35:32.127
No.

35:32.129 --> 35:34.496
Yeah. Oh, you don't believe me?

35:34.498 --> 35:36.931
Take a look.
He's right over there.

35:36.933 --> 35:39.401
Come on. Look.

35:39.403 --> 35:42.303
He's just spilling
his guts.

35:44.473 --> 35:46.741
♪

35:51.080 --> 35:52.380
Why don't you have a seat.

35:53.315 --> 35:54.482
Sit.

35:57.620 --> 36:01.156
Don't let him put
the whole blame on you.

36:01.158 --> 36:03.058
Why don't you talk to us
and maybe

36:03.060 --> 36:04.826
we can help you.
You're lying.

36:04.828 --> 36:06.594
Come on, we got
no reason to lie to you.

36:06.596 --> 36:07.896
He told us everything

36:07.898 --> 36:10.498
about him and Ella,
you know, the thing.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.400
He didn't have a <i>thing</i> with her.

36:12.402 --> 36:14.003
It's not like
we're telling you something

36:14.004 --> 36:15.270
you don't already know here.

36:15.272 --> 36:16.471
He loves me!

36:16.473 --> 36:18.039
We're going to get married.

36:18.041 --> 36:20.608
No, you're going to jail.

36:20.610 --> 36:23.578
And he's gonna be looking
for another girlfriend.

36:25.614 --> 36:28.016
All right,
so let's go over this now.

36:28.018 --> 36:30.018
You found out
about Jose and Ella,

36:30.020 --> 36:32.587
you got pissed off,
you wanted to confront her,

36:32.589 --> 36:34.222
and...
I didn't confront her,

36:34.224 --> 36:36.725
I just asked her
to back off, that's all.

36:36.727 --> 36:38.026
But she wouldn't.

36:40.262 --> 36:42.297
Listen...

36:42.299 --> 36:45.500
uh, between you and me...

36:45.502 --> 36:49.003
I don't believe Jose when he
says that you killed her.

36:49.005 --> 36:50.638
He said that?

36:50.640 --> 36:54.976
We... believe it was
probably just an accident.

36:54.978 --> 36:57.278
You didn't mean to do it.

36:57.280 --> 37:00.648
You were just angry
and wanted to talk,

37:00.650 --> 37:03.084
and things escalated
and got out of control,

37:03.086 --> 37:04.486
isn't that right?

37:04.488 --> 37:05.987
That's right.

37:05.989 --> 37:06.821
Of course.

37:06.823 --> 37:08.490
I didn't mean it.

37:08.492 --> 37:09.858
I swear.

37:09.860 --> 37:11.326
You were just angry.

37:11.328 --> 37:13.094
I was angry...

37:13.096 --> 37:17.298
and I was high off of the drugs
that he gave me!

37:18.134 --> 37:19.768
Okay.

37:19.770 --> 37:22.137
Why don't you settle
down, all right?

37:29.411 --> 37:32.013
And I-I think I need a lawyer.

37:37.787 --> 37:39.988
(softly):
Have a seat.

37:50.232 --> 37:52.767
Thinking of becoming
a detective?

37:54.136 --> 37:57.539
Nah. They said
I could wait here.

37:57.541 --> 38:00.141
Mm-hmm. They released you
already, huh?

38:00.143 --> 38:01.242
About a hour ago.

38:01.244 --> 38:02.911
And you came straight here.

38:02.913 --> 38:04.946
You remember that lawyer?

38:04.948 --> 38:07.115
The one that was at the trial?

38:07.117 --> 38:09.017
Oh, yeah.

38:09.019 --> 38:11.486
Well, that's not the first one
they assigned me.

38:11.488 --> 38:14.155
The first one said
I should take a deal

38:14.157 --> 38:16.224
that the D.A.'s office offered.

38:17.393 --> 38:18.927
You know what that deal was?

38:18.929 --> 38:20.929
I could probably guess.

38:20.931 --> 38:23.064
15 years.

38:23.066 --> 38:25.567
Out in ten with good behavior.

38:26.602 --> 38:28.236
All I had to do was confess.

38:28.238 --> 38:29.804
Right.

38:29.806 --> 38:32.207
Confess to a crime
you didn't commit.

38:33.676 --> 38:36.911
You know, the funny thing is,
I actually thought about it.

38:36.913 --> 38:38.646
Why?

38:38.648 --> 38:41.549
'Cause I didn't think
anybody would believe me.

38:43.085 --> 38:45.653
Well, I'm glad
you didn't take that deal.

38:45.655 --> 38:47.422
Yeah.

38:49.425 --> 38:51.159
Thank you.

38:57.233 --> 38:59.400
(sighs)

39:04.773 --> 39:06.774
(sighs)

39:11.847 --> 39:13.648
Hi.

39:13.650 --> 39:15.283
Hey.

39:17.119 --> 39:20.288
So, he won't be arraigned
until tomorrow.

39:21.690 --> 39:23.291
Good.

39:23.293 --> 39:26.661
Yeah, yeah. Um...

39:26.663 --> 39:29.898
I just wanted to say that...

39:29.900 --> 39:32.667
you're a real pain in the ass.

39:34.436 --> 39:38.106
Thank you for convincing me
to come forward.

39:38.941 --> 39:40.875
No problem.

39:40.877 --> 39:42.677
How you doing?

39:44.413 --> 39:46.414
Okay.

39:46.416 --> 39:49.117
I guess.
(laughs softly)

39:49.119 --> 39:51.452
I'm really hungry.

39:52.288 --> 39:54.822
We skipped our meal today.

39:54.824 --> 39:56.658
Wow, and you haven't
collapsed yet.

39:57.993 --> 40:01.629
Want to go to Anton's
and get some ribs?

40:02.564 --> 40:05.133
It's all-you-can-eat Tuesdays.

40:07.202 --> 40:09.070
Yep, with your appetite,

40:09.072 --> 40:11.706
we might just put
them out of business.

40:11.708 --> 40:13.441
(laughs)

40:17.212 --> 40:19.747
Frank.

40:19.749 --> 40:21.749
(laughs):
Hey, you went to DiPalo's again.

40:25.487 --> 40:27.488
Corner liquor store.

40:28.390 --> 40:31.059
Hey. All right.

40:31.061 --> 40:33.394
You missed my arraignment.

40:33.396 --> 40:34.996
(sighs)
I'm telling you,

40:34.998 --> 40:37.298
first time I've ever had
to hire my own attorney.

40:37.300 --> 40:38.900
Was he any good?

40:38.902 --> 40:40.735
Yeah, $10,000 bail.

40:40.737 --> 40:42.203
Not bad.

40:42.205 --> 40:45.506
And I wish you would've told me
you invited the press, you know?

40:45.508 --> 40:47.241
I would have changed my robe.

40:48.077 --> 40:50.878
You hear from Romano?

40:50.880 --> 40:52.814
Yeah. He reached out for me.

40:52.816 --> 40:54.916
Wanted to know
if I needed any help.

40:54.918 --> 40:56.484
Offered to pay my lawyer bill.

40:56.486 --> 40:58.186
(chuckles)
How do you like that?

40:59.388 --> 41:01.889
Wise guys get a lot of perks.

41:01.891 --> 41:03.658
Yeah, they do.

41:03.660 --> 41:06.094
So do police commissioners.

41:10.766 --> 41:13.368
How could I ever
thank you, Frank?

41:16.271 --> 41:18.306
You up for it?

41:19.942 --> 41:22.243
You're kidding, right?
All right.

41:23.912 --> 41:26.047
But I call the game, all right?

41:26.049 --> 41:29.817
Chicago Night Baseball,
with a buy.

41:29.819 --> 41:31.219
What are we, 14?

41:31.221 --> 41:32.520
(chuckles)

41:32.522 --> 41:35.189
Well, I hope you brought
an extra shirt...

41:35.191 --> 41:38.126
because you, my friend,
are gonna lose yours.

41:38.741 --> 41:40.440
Shut up and deal.

41:41.020 --> 41:43.187
Oh, put the pin away; this
is getting serious now.

41:43.189 --> 41:44.555
Go ahead, cut.
