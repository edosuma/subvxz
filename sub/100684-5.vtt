WEBVTT

00:05.527 --> 00:08.051
I cannot believe
Ben did this to us.

00:08.095 --> 00:10.053
[train rattling]

00:10.097 --> 00:11.533
I can.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.019
[sighs]

00:22.109 --> 00:23.501
Felix, what-what i-is...

00:23.545 --> 00:25.808
We need to talk. Wake Murphy up.

00:28.115 --> 00:30.334
So, how was your guys' night
last night?

00:30.378 --> 00:32.336
'Cause I nearly drowned.

00:33.381 --> 00:35.426
Where?
In a toilet.

00:35.470 --> 00:37.385
What?

00:37.428 --> 00:39.822
FELIX:
It's...
This is serious, Jessica.

00:39.865 --> 00:41.302
It was one of Nia's guys.

00:41.345 --> 00:43.434
I have no idea how he found out,
but I skimmed some money

00:43.478 --> 00:44.827
from the stash or whatever...

00:44.870 --> 00:46.742
Wait, what?
You skimmed money?

00:46.785 --> 00:48.352
Oh, my God.Felix...

00:48.396 --> 00:50.224
Yes, yes, Jessica, I did.
I skimmed some money.

00:50.267 --> 00:52.835
Because unlike you two, I can't
just have sex whenever I want.

00:52.878 --> 00:55.446
You paid Chelsea
to have sex with you?

00:55.490 --> 00:56.752
No. I took her to a restaurant.

00:56.795 --> 01:00.669
My point is that I don't
want to do this anymore.

01:00.712 --> 01:03.889
It sucks.
I just, I want my life back.

01:03.933 --> 01:05.326
Well, there's
no way out.

01:05.369 --> 01:06.979
Well,

01:07.023 --> 01:09.895
we can't go to the cops because
they're protecting Dean, right?

01:09.939 --> 01:12.463
But what if we go to the feds?

01:13.508 --> 01:14.857
You want to go to the FBI?

01:14.900 --> 01:18.165
Yes. Look, if we turn
ourselves in, we might be able

01:18.208 --> 01:19.775
to prove that we were forced
into this

01:19.818 --> 01:22.125
and get some sort
of cooperation agreement.

01:22.169 --> 01:24.388
We could, we could do that?Maybe.

01:24.432 --> 01:27.217
Maybe. I mean, you know,
i-it's extremely risky.

01:27.261 --> 01:28.349
Nia could retaliate,

01:28.392 --> 01:30.786
but Murphy says
she's not that stupid?

01:30.829 --> 01:33.658
Hmm.So, I put in a call

01:33.702 --> 01:35.660
to my college roommate
who is a defense attorney.

01:35.704 --> 01:36.879
We'll see what he says.

01:36.922 --> 01:38.489
Okay. That's great.

01:38.533 --> 01:39.795
I mean, we...

01:39.838 --> 01:41.188
What did we even do?

01:41.231 --> 01:43.146
I mean, we just laundered money
for, like, a month.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.713
It's not that big a deal.
And I'm done

01:44.756 --> 01:46.236
letting people walk all over me.

01:46.280 --> 01:49.370
Done.Yes. Yes, yes, Felix.

01:49.413 --> 01:51.589
Yeah, yes. Okay, great.

01:51.633 --> 01:52.808
[exhales]:
Okay.

01:52.851 --> 01:54.418
This is great.This is great.

01:54.462 --> 01:55.811
It could be great.Yeah.

01:55.854 --> 01:57.029
Okay.Yeah.

01:57.073 --> 01:59.162
I don't want to get
my hopes up but, um,

01:59.206 --> 02:00.511
I'm gonna go take a shower.

02:00.555 --> 02:02.426
Okay.

02:02.470 --> 02:04.385
Yeah.

02:04.428 --> 02:05.864
This is good.

02:05.908 --> 02:08.476
[door closes]You know?

02:08.519 --> 02:09.694
Yeah...

02:09.738 --> 02:12.044
So, um... [clears throat]

02:12.088 --> 02:13.394
[sniffles]

02:13.437 --> 02:17.137
Your, uh...
[sighs]

02:17.180 --> 02:19.530
...your little plan
isn't gonna work.

02:19.574 --> 02:22.098
What? What are you
talking about?

02:24.056 --> 02:26.058
Murphy.

02:26.102 --> 02:28.365
What are you talking about?

02:28.409 --> 02:32.239
We're not just laundering
some money.

02:36.112 --> 02:38.897
Oh, my God.

02:38.941 --> 02:40.943
â™ª

02:46.949 --> 02:48.298
Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God,

02:48.342 --> 02:49.517
oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

02:49.560 --> 02:51.693
[panting]

02:51.736 --> 02:53.564
[whispering]:
This is a lot of drugs.

02:53.608 --> 02:56.437
It's a lot of drugs.
Like, a lot of drugs.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.308
It's gonna be okay. I promise.

02:58.352 --> 03:00.658
Oh, you promise? Okay, cool.

03:00.702 --> 03:03.661
Just-- I'm sorry, okay?

03:03.705 --> 03:07.099
I'm really, really,
really sorry.

03:07.143 --> 03:09.363
She was gonna kill Max,
and it was my only move.

03:11.539 --> 03:14.237
We'll just pretend they're not
there until they're not there.

03:14.281 --> 03:17.414
We have to tell Jess.
No!

03:17.458 --> 03:19.982
No.

03:20.025 --> 03:22.245
No. She's, like, attached
at the hip to Sterling right now

03:22.289 --> 03:25.161
and she's gonna have a meltdown
and she's gonna tell her.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.554
And we cannot
have that.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.860
All right. Fine.

03:28.904 --> 03:30.993
STERLING:
How old were you?

03:31.036 --> 03:33.604
I was in seventh grade,
so I don't know, 13?

03:33.648 --> 03:35.258
In seventh grade?Yes.

03:35.302 --> 03:37.042
You kissed your first girl
in seventh grade?

03:37.086 --> 03:38.696
Yes. I know.

03:42.657 --> 03:44.746
Ladies.
[chuckles]

03:44.789 --> 03:46.400
Hi.
Hey.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.449
Uh, hi, Murph.

03:53.450 --> 03:54.799
Hey.

03:54.843 --> 03:57.367
What were you two doing
in the bathroom together?

03:57.411 --> 04:01.632
My bra got unhooked
and I asked him to help me.

04:03.330 --> 04:06.158
It's Felix.
And I couldn't find you. What?

04:06.202 --> 04:09.423
Uh, I should go to my desk.

04:12.208 --> 04:15.167
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Sending text to Murphy.

04:15.211 --> 04:16.778
Hey.

04:16.821 --> 04:19.302
What did I say?
I don't want you talking to her.

04:19.346 --> 04:21.173
Technically, I'm texting,
so I'm not breaking any rules.

04:21.217 --> 04:23.698
[sighs]
This is not a joke.

04:23.741 --> 04:25.352
But I really need
to talk to her.

04:25.395 --> 04:28.268
Okay, well, then, you can talk
to one of your other friends.

04:29.356 --> 04:32.402
Or you can talk to me.

04:32.446 --> 04:35.275
I don't even understand
what happened with you guys.

04:35.318 --> 04:36.711
I don't ask you for much, Chloe,

04:36.754 --> 04:38.495
but I need you to do
this one thing for me.

04:38.539 --> 04:41.672
Can you please not talk to her?But she's my friend.

04:41.716 --> 04:43.370
And I am your dad.
What I say goes.Dad!

04:43.413 --> 04:44.893
You can have this back
when you start listening.

04:44.936 --> 04:46.938
Now come on. We're
already late for school.

04:48.940 --> 04:52.117
Hey. What's up, man?

04:52.161 --> 04:54.424
What's the big emergency?Hey.

04:54.468 --> 04:56.818
Oh. So serious.

04:56.861 --> 04:59.647
I talked to Sam.
The cops didn't get Nia.

04:59.690 --> 05:02.954
She moved her stash
before they got there.

05:02.998 --> 05:06.784
Are you kidding me?
No.

05:06.828 --> 05:08.351
You find out
where she moved it?

05:08.395 --> 05:09.570
No, but I'm-a try.

05:09.613 --> 05:11.746
Ooh. You gonna try.

05:11.789 --> 05:13.704
That's all you got?For now.

05:13.748 --> 05:14.879
Look, man,

05:14.923 --> 05:17.317
this is not a game, bro.I know.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.928
I'm gonna meet with Nia now.
I will figure it out.

05:19.971 --> 05:21.930
I don't mean to
state the obvious,

05:21.973 --> 05:24.715
but Josiah will
kill us both.

05:24.759 --> 05:28.545
I'll figure it out.

05:28.589 --> 05:29.807
A'ight.

05:31.505 --> 05:32.593
[exhales]

05:32.636 --> 05:34.116
Hey, what'd the chief say?

05:34.159 --> 05:37.337
What do you think he said?
He's pissed about the raid.

05:37.380 --> 05:38.686
I'm pissed, too.

05:38.729 --> 05:40.296
What the heck, man?

05:40.340 --> 05:41.906
So Max Parish
played us?

05:41.950 --> 05:44.344
No. I think he made
a deal with Nia.

05:44.387 --> 05:48.739
It's the only possible reason
he'd still be alive.

05:48.783 --> 05:51.742
Gotta find where
she moved those drugs.

05:51.786 --> 05:54.005
Get a warrant
for Max Parish's apartment.

05:54.049 --> 05:55.877
I want his computer,
his phone,

05:55.920 --> 05:58.488
anything that might have
more of Nia's contacts.

05:58.532 --> 05:59.750
Got it.

06:02.971 --> 06:04.538
Hey.

06:04.581 --> 06:07.802
British dude's here to see you.

06:07.845 --> 06:09.456
You know, the one from the IRS?

06:09.499 --> 06:11.501
Yeah. It's cool.
You can just send him back.

06:11.545 --> 06:12.894
[sniffles]All yours.

06:12.937 --> 06:15.636
Murphy. Hi.

06:15.679 --> 06:18.116
Uh, sorry to just drop by, but
I was, I was down the street.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.770
No-- I mean, that's fine.

06:19.814 --> 06:21.206
What's going on?
Is everything okay?

06:21.250 --> 06:24.601
Uh, no. Well, yeah, kind of.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.740
My boss found a mistake
in one of my reports.

06:32.783 --> 06:36.047
U-Uh, it wasn't
a big deal, but I...

06:36.091 --> 06:39.790
I need to be able
to read to do my job.

06:39.834 --> 06:42.445
So is there, like,
a trick to help me?

06:42.489 --> 06:44.186
Or... I actually read
that you can put the material

06:44.229 --> 06:47.363
in the middle...You know what?
There is, actually.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.713
The trick is you admit
you're going blind,

06:49.757 --> 06:53.021
and you have your phone
read everything for you.

06:53.064 --> 06:54.762
I just don't think
I'm there yet.

06:54.805 --> 06:57.329
I know it sucks.

06:57.373 --> 07:00.681
It sucks, but there's technology
that helps.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.030
Okay?

07:04.075 --> 07:06.861
[sighs]
Let me show you.

07:07.905 --> 07:09.472
DARNELL:
[sighs] Yeah.

07:09.516 --> 07:11.518
So, Sam told me
about last night.

07:11.561 --> 07:13.215
Lucky you got it out in time.

07:13.258 --> 07:16.261
Hmm. Not luck.
I'm good at my job.

07:16.305 --> 07:18.829
So you got a new spot, then?

07:19.874 --> 07:23.138
So, you come here for a reason?

07:23.181 --> 07:28.535
I... Nah, I just wanted
to report back that I, uh...

07:28.578 --> 07:30.711
took care of that
Josiah message.

07:31.842 --> 07:32.887
You came all the way down here
to tell me

07:32.930 --> 07:34.279
you did what I asked you to do?

07:34.323 --> 07:36.978
What you want,
a cookie, baby?

07:37.021 --> 07:39.807
Nah. All good.

07:39.850 --> 07:42.462
[clears throat]

07:42.505 --> 07:45.334
What about the drop later?
You want me on it?

07:45.377 --> 07:48.206
No. Thank you.

07:48.250 --> 07:50.034
I'm actually gonna
try out somebody new.

07:51.079 --> 07:53.821
Cool.

07:53.864 --> 07:56.127
[clears throat]

07:56.171 --> 07:57.781
MURPHY: This thing just literally reads

07:57.825 --> 07:58.913
everything for me.

07:58.956 --> 08:00.392
[beeps]

08:00.436 --> 08:02.525
AUTOMATED VOICE:
From Department
of Water Management.

08:02.569 --> 08:05.789
Subject: Help us with
this one-minute survey.

08:05.833 --> 08:08.792
See? Just obviously delete that.
It's trash.

08:08.836 --> 08:10.881
Cal from unknown number.[phone vibrating]

08:10.925 --> 08:13.449
And then, it tells you
when someone's calling, see?

08:13.493 --> 08:15.451
Hello?

08:15.495 --> 08:18.410
[over phone]:
It's Nia.

08:18.454 --> 08:20.456
Oh. Hi.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.198
Just, uh... One second, sorry.

08:23.241 --> 08:25.200
Hi.

08:25.243 --> 08:27.115
I need you to make a delivery
for me this afternoon.

08:27.158 --> 08:30.945
Oh, okay.

08:30.988 --> 08:33.556
W-What am I delivering?

08:33.600 --> 08:35.558
Take a guess.

08:40.998 --> 08:43.479
Uh, sorry, I, uh, I actually
really have to get back to work.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.959
Oh. Well, I-I thought
you were gonna

08:45.002 --> 08:46.177
show me how to set my phone.

08:46.221 --> 08:48.136
Uh, yeah. I-I can.

08:48.179 --> 08:50.181
Um, I c-- I can later.

08:50.225 --> 08:52.967
M-Maybe we could grab a drink
or something when I get off?

08:53.010 --> 08:54.577
Wh-- Yeah, sure.Okay.

08:54.621 --> 08:55.665
Yeah, that'd be great.

08:55.709 --> 08:56.579
There's this place
called the Linsmore.

08:56.623 --> 08:58.189
I can be there by 8:00.

08:58.233 --> 08:59.887
It's pretty underwhelming,
but luckily,

08:59.930 --> 09:02.150
your vision is slowly dying
with every passing breath.

09:02.193 --> 09:03.934
So...[laughs softly]

09:03.978 --> 09:05.196
Thank you for that, Murphy.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.071
Hi, Frank.

09:10.114 --> 09:11.638
It's Jess.
Hi.

09:11.681 --> 09:14.162
Thank you so much for squeezing
us in at the last minute.

09:14.205 --> 09:16.338
Yeah, of course.
Um, what's going on with Dixie?

09:16.381 --> 09:17.905
FRANK:
Uh, she just hasn't
been herself.

09:17.948 --> 09:20.124
I took her out for a walk and
she didn't stop at the curb,

09:20.168 --> 09:21.343
which is unusual
for her.

09:21.386 --> 09:23.345
FELIX:
Why?

09:23.388 --> 09:26.783
Why? Why are we the ones
that have to do this?

09:26.827 --> 09:28.045
I don't know.

09:28.089 --> 09:30.439
Maybe because we're the ones
that have it?

09:30.482 --> 09:33.137
Oh, and whose fault is that?I'm sorry, okay?

09:33.181 --> 09:34.704
[groans]

09:34.748 --> 09:37.620
Felix, I really
need you right now.

09:37.664 --> 09:38.882
Please.

09:39.927 --> 09:41.929
[sighs, moans]

09:48.588 --> 09:50.285
Fine. Okay.

09:50.328 --> 09:51.460
What's the plan?

09:51.503 --> 09:54.898
Sam is gonna call,
give us the address,

09:54.942 --> 09:58.641
but we're supposed to apparently
to drop off "five bundles"

09:58.685 --> 09:59.903
to someone at 3:00.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.735
So we just wait?

10:05.779 --> 10:07.694
I guess so.

10:08.695 --> 10:09.957
Cool.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.480
FRANK:
She hasn't had
much of an appetite,

10:11.523 --> 10:14.483
and she doesn't call as
quickly as she used to, so...

10:14.526 --> 10:17.138
I'm not sure.
I just got a little worried.

10:18.182 --> 10:20.576
Yeah. Uh, okay.

10:20.620 --> 10:25.146
Yes, um, uh, I-I'll run some
tests and see what's going on.

10:25.189 --> 10:26.626
Thanks.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.542
[sighs]

10:30.586 --> 10:31.718
[door thuds]

10:31.761 --> 10:33.415
[door handle jiggles]

10:33.458 --> 10:35.025
What was that?

10:35.069 --> 10:36.461
Someone's
trying to get in.

10:36.505 --> 10:38.420
[knocking on door]

10:42.554 --> 10:44.165
Hi!

10:45.209 --> 10:46.428
Jess...

10:46.471 --> 10:49.126
Sorry.Guys, what's going on?

10:49.170 --> 10:50.432
I know there's something
you're not telling me,

10:50.475 --> 10:51.694
because you two don't
even like each other,

10:51.738 --> 10:52.782
and now you're
hanging out all day?

10:52.826 --> 10:54.218
I love Murphy.I like Felix.

10:54.262 --> 10:55.829
I likeMurphy.

10:57.482 --> 10:58.701
You talked to the lawyer,

10:58.745 --> 11:00.660
and you don't want
to tell me bad news.

11:00.703 --> 11:03.575
Just please give it to
me. I can take it.

11:03.619 --> 11:06.361
Yeah, we-- [sighs]
It wasn't great.

11:06.404 --> 11:07.710
Um...Yeah...

11:07.754 --> 11:09.669
He said we're sort of
stuck in this for now.

11:09.712 --> 11:13.585
[sighs] Okay.
Wh-- What did he say, exactly?

11:13.629 --> 11:17.067
[inhales] Just that it would be
really hard to prove

11:17.111 --> 11:19.896
that we were forced into it.

11:19.940 --> 11:21.071
I'm really sorry, Jess.

11:21.115 --> 11:23.770
Okay. [exhales]

11:23.813 --> 11:25.859
Well, um...

11:25.902 --> 11:27.687
Thank you for at least trying.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.906
Yeah, of course.

11:29.950 --> 11:32.779
[door closes]

11:32.822 --> 11:34.563
[exhales]

11:34.606 --> 11:36.391
[whistle blows]

11:36.434 --> 11:39.133
[indistinct chatter]

11:45.530 --> 11:47.184
Do you care if
I sit here?

11:47.228 --> 11:49.273
Sure.

11:49.317 --> 11:51.232
Who is that?

11:51.275 --> 11:53.451
Amber.Oh, hi.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.498
Why aren't
you swimming?

11:56.541 --> 11:59.762
I just got my period.That sucks.

11:59.806 --> 12:00.807
Mm-hmm.

12:00.850 --> 12:03.592
Mine just ended.

12:03.635 --> 12:06.464
Oh, this is so boring.

12:06.508 --> 12:08.205
I can't believe
they won't even let us

12:08.249 --> 12:09.903
use our phones
if we can't swim.

12:09.946 --> 12:12.601
Like, what are we
supposed to do?

12:12.644 --> 12:16.387
I don't know. My dad took
mine away this morning anyway.

12:16.431 --> 12:19.086
[chuckling]:
Oh, my God, he did?

12:19.129 --> 12:20.087
I would die.

12:20.130 --> 12:24.439
Yeah, I sort of am.

12:24.482 --> 12:25.701
Ugh, this sucks.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.269
Let's ditch
and go get nachos.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.358
Now?

12:30.401 --> 12:31.751
Yeah.

12:34.797 --> 12:38.540
This dude's got condoms
in every room.

12:41.195 --> 12:42.674
Extra large. Yeah, all right.

12:42.718 --> 12:43.806
What you got, man?

12:55.426 --> 12:57.298
Well, there aren't
any contacts here.

12:57.341 --> 13:01.432
There's nothing here.
Not even a phone.

13:01.476 --> 13:03.826
He must've kept his
important stuff somewhere else.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.610
[phone rings]

13:06.524 --> 13:09.353
Detective Riley.

13:10.485 --> 13:13.357
Wait... Chloe did what?

13:14.968 --> 13:16.447
How many?

13:16.491 --> 13:17.797
Five.

13:23.585 --> 13:25.630
FELIX:
Okay.You have five?

13:25.674 --> 13:27.937
Yes, Murphy.
I know how to count.

13:27.981 --> 13:31.245
Pretzel.
Come on.

13:31.288 --> 13:33.116
Okay, good boy. Forward.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.640
Oh, crap. We have to take
the grooming truck.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.512
Why?
Because Jess
drove us, remember?

13:37.555 --> 13:39.166
DEAN:
Hi.

13:39.209 --> 13:40.341
Where's Chloe?

13:43.431 --> 13:45.433
Felix, this doesn't
concern you, please leave.

13:47.261 --> 13:49.176
Chloe? Chloe!

13:49.219 --> 13:50.220
MURPHY: She's not
here, you psycho.

13:51.352 --> 13:53.310
I know she cut class to see you.

13:53.354 --> 13:54.572
Yeah, and don't you think
if she was here,

13:54.616 --> 13:56.009
she'd bewith me?

13:56.879 --> 13:59.447
Leave her alone.

13:59.490 --> 14:02.754
Don't text her,
don't call her, just stop.

14:02.798 --> 14:05.932
[exhales]

14:35.135 --> 14:36.788
Gene.

14:36.832 --> 14:39.748
I think I might know
where some of Max's stuff is.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.450
FELIX:
Murphy, that was way too close.
I was face to face with a cop,

14:46.494 --> 14:47.582
with a bunch of drugs in my bag.

14:47.625 --> 14:50.324
If we're actually
moving this stuff,

14:50.367 --> 14:52.543
we have to do it after hours,
when no one else is around.

14:52.587 --> 14:53.980
Okay, Felix, yeah.
I'll just tell Nia

14:54.023 --> 14:55.807
this doesn't really work
with your schedule.

14:58.723 --> 15:00.116
It's 2:30.
Why aren't they calling?

15:00.160 --> 15:01.901
I don't know.It's gonna take more
than a half hour

15:01.944 --> 15:04.077
to get to the city,
plus traffic.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.339
I just don't know
why we can't be more organized

15:05.382 --> 15:06.340
about it,
you know? Supposed to be...

15:06.383 --> 15:08.124
[banging on door] Ooh!

15:08.168 --> 15:08.951
Hey.Jess!

15:08.995 --> 15:11.954
Hi.
What's up?

15:11.998 --> 15:14.348
I saw you guys walking out, so--
Where are you going?

15:14.391 --> 15:16.654
Where are wegoing?

15:16.698 --> 15:17.917
Felix wanted a smoothie,

15:17.960 --> 15:19.657
and I was, like,
oh, that sounds good, so...

15:19.701 --> 15:22.530
Yeah. Just craving a smoothie.
Super weird.

15:22.573 --> 15:23.792
A smoothie?

15:23.835 --> 15:25.185
Yeah. I would've asked you,

15:25.228 --> 15:28.057
but you know, I know you're busy
with... Trixie...

15:28.101 --> 15:29.145
Dixie.Dixie.

15:29.189 --> 15:30.538
So I didn't ask you.

15:30.581 --> 15:32.018
But I would've, and I will.

15:32.061 --> 15:33.280
Next time.[phone buzzing]

15:33.323 --> 15:35.021
Um... yeah,

15:35.064 --> 15:36.457
we really got to go, though.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.981
But, um, just text me
if you want anything, okay?

15:41.853 --> 15:43.594
Love you.

15:45.118 --> 15:48.164
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Call from unknown number.Sorry.

15:48.208 --> 15:49.426
[whispering]:
That must be them.

15:49.470 --> 15:51.037
Yeah, no duh.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.039
Hello?

15:53.082 --> 15:55.215
Hill Heights Grocery.
Okay.

15:56.042 --> 16:00.437
Green Floret
Trucking.

16:00.481 --> 16:02.657
Truck number
5-6-4-3.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.572
Yeah, got it.
We'll be there.

16:04.615 --> 16:06.704
Okay.

16:08.097 --> 16:10.708
Okay.

16:10.752 --> 16:12.797
[exhales]

16:12.841 --> 16:13.885
[starts engine]

16:20.196 --> 16:21.545
Chloe Riley.

16:21.589 --> 16:24.026
What is going on? Now you
think you can cut class?

16:24.070 --> 16:25.419
Dad, it was nothing.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.029
Do not tell me
it was nothing.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.378
Now you're gonna march back
into that school,

16:28.422 --> 16:29.684
and then you're gonna
march home.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.164
Those are the only two places
you are gonna be

16:31.207 --> 16:32.382
for the next month, understand?

16:32.426 --> 16:34.080
Yes.
Good.

16:34.123 --> 16:35.472
Go back to class.

16:35.516 --> 16:38.127
[chuckles] That
was dramatic.

16:38.171 --> 16:41.217
Mr. Riley?
Mr. Riley.Hi.

16:41.261 --> 16:42.827
Hope Miranda.

16:42.871 --> 16:44.829
I'm, I'm the administrator.
Do you have a second?

16:44.873 --> 16:47.093
Uh-- No. Actually,
I have to head back to work.

16:47.136 --> 16:48.659
Oh. Okay.

16:48.703 --> 16:51.097
We just haven't received Chloe's
tuition for this semester,

16:51.140 --> 16:53.186
and we're two months in.
I just wanted to check in...

16:53.229 --> 16:55.753
Yeah, uh.. really?
Um... sorry about that.

16:55.797 --> 16:57.364
I will, uh, figure it out.

16:57.407 --> 17:00.193
I'll get it to you
as soon as possible, okay?Thank you.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.980
[phone ringing]

17:05.024 --> 17:07.809
Yeah.

17:07.852 --> 17:09.419
TREY:
She give you the new location
or what?

17:09.463 --> 17:11.639
Nah, but I'm handling it now.

17:11.682 --> 17:13.380
What? How?

17:13.423 --> 17:15.730
There's a weekly drop
I know she can't miss.

17:15.773 --> 17:18.689
Whoever drops off the product
will know where the stash is.

17:18.733 --> 17:21.823
And whoever does the drop
is just gonna tell you

17:21.866 --> 17:23.085
where it came from?

17:23.129 --> 17:25.435
Yeah.

17:25.479 --> 17:28.177
I'll make sure.

17:28.221 --> 17:31.789
TREY: Listen, man,
you'd better, or we're...Trey... I know.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.269
God...

17:38.535 --> 17:40.842
You got to be kidding me.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.934
[exhales]

17:45.977 --> 17:48.284
Come on...

17:53.289 --> 17:54.899
Here, I got that.What?

17:54.943 --> 17:56.379
I got that.

17:56.423 --> 17:57.815
Watch my back, okay?

17:57.859 --> 17:59.165
Yeah, I'll just
keep my eyes open.

17:59.208 --> 18:00.383
Hello.

18:02.211 --> 18:06.041
Uh, we're here for the...

18:06.085 --> 18:07.303
[quietly]:
delivery?

18:07.347 --> 18:09.740
Put it on the truck bed?

18:16.356 --> 18:18.619
What the hell is this?

18:18.662 --> 18:21.143
There's five. I counted.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.145
This is five bricks.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.886
Are you out of your mind?

18:24.929 --> 18:28.150
Sorry. Um...

18:28.194 --> 18:30.326
This is good.

18:30.370 --> 18:34.156
Don't ever bring that much
again, you idiots.

18:34.200 --> 18:38.682
Copy that. All right.

18:38.726 --> 18:42.077
Nice to, uh... Pleasure.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.861
Murphy, let's go.

18:48.953 --> 18:51.434
At least now we know
what a bundle is.

18:51.478 --> 18:55.221
Yeah. Five bundles
to a brick, apparently.

18:56.309 --> 18:58.615
Okay.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-
whoa-whoa.

18:58.659 --> 19:00.226
Not during business
hours, I told you.

19:00.269 --> 19:02.445
Felix.Give me that,
I'll hide it.

19:02.489 --> 19:03.533
My God.

19:03.577 --> 19:05.753
Are you serious?

19:05.796 --> 19:07.537
Just leave it in the bag,
let's go.

19:07.581 --> 19:08.886
That's suspicious.

19:08.930 --> 19:11.324
People obviously saw me
leave with a backpack.

19:11.367 --> 19:14.153
Do you think anyone cares enough
about you to notice that?

19:14.196 --> 19:17.112
Okay, sure.
Whatever.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.158
Okay, let's go.
Come on, Pretzel.

19:19.201 --> 19:22.204
Hey, Ben.

19:22.248 --> 19:23.466
What happened to
your backpack?

19:23.510 --> 19:28.384
Must've, uh, forgotten it.
I'll go grab it.

19:40.440 --> 19:43.660
"Do you think anybody
even notices you, Felix?"

19:43.704 --> 19:46.185
"Nobody even notices
what you do."

19:51.581 --> 19:53.757
Got it.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.803
Got what?

19:58.240 --> 20:02.723
No-- Get up. You should work,
we have to look normal.

20:02.766 --> 20:04.246
I ambeing normal.

20:04.290 --> 20:05.639
I know what you're doing.

20:05.682 --> 20:07.336
You know that if you
go to your desk,

20:07.380 --> 20:10.252
you're just gonna
pass Jess' office.

20:10.296 --> 20:11.384
That's not true.
Yes.

20:11.427 --> 20:12.646
It istrue,

20:12.689 --> 20:14.038
and I know this because
I'm holding in,

20:14.082 --> 20:16.606
like, a gallon of pee
for the exact same reason.

20:18.478 --> 20:20.436
I just hate
lying to her.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.525
At least you don't
have to see her face.

20:22.569 --> 20:25.441
Yes, Felix, what a gift
God has given me.

20:25.485 --> 20:28.575
[machinery whirring]

20:28.618 --> 20:30.968
What is--
What is that?

20:34.320 --> 20:37.192
[siren whoops]Whoa.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.237
Felix?

20:39.368 --> 20:42.066
[siren whoops]

20:48.638 --> 20:50.074
The cops can do that?
They can just take the truck?

20:50.118 --> 20:51.337
The truck is registered
to Max Parish,

20:51.380 --> 20:53.513
and they're using it
as evidence relevant

20:53.556 --> 20:57.647
to the commission of an act
of money laundering.

20:57.691 --> 21:00.520
So it's about Max,
not about us.Yeah, but...

21:00.563 --> 21:02.173
So there's nothing
to worry about.Yeah, yeah.

21:02.217 --> 21:03.653
Except for the fact that
they seized the truck

21:03.697 --> 21:05.264
we're using for money laundering
to investigate Max

21:05.307 --> 21:07.918
for money laundering.

21:07.962 --> 21:09.311
Oh, my God,
plus the gu-- the gun.

21:09.355 --> 21:11.226
You guys, there's a gun.
We have a gun on the truck.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.575
I moved it into my desk drawer

21:12.619 --> 21:14.577
after we started
getting actual customers.

21:14.621 --> 21:17.058
There's nothing on the truck
besides some shampoo.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.235
Okay?

21:20.279 --> 21:21.497
We'll just all act normal.

21:21.541 --> 21:23.369
It's fine. It's gonna be
fine, Jess, I promise.

21:23.412 --> 21:25.109
Mm-hmm, okay, I--

21:25.153 --> 21:27.111
Yeah.

21:31.986 --> 21:32.943
We are not fine.

21:32.987 --> 21:34.162
You don't think I know that?

21:34.205 --> 21:35.250
Thank you.

21:38.035 --> 21:39.036
That's a cute dog.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.864
Thanks.

21:42.605 --> 21:43.824
My prints are
on those drugs, Murphy.

21:43.867 --> 21:45.347
My prints are all over
those drugs.

21:45.391 --> 21:46.827
We're gonna figure
this out, okay?

21:46.870 --> 21:48.350
Murphy, the truck is
currently being towed

21:48.394 --> 21:51.135
to an impound lot,
where they will search it

21:51.179 --> 21:53.747
and they will find
so much heroin!

21:53.790 --> 21:56.315
It's over. It's over.
My life is over.

21:56.358 --> 21:58.534
It's not over. Go ask Jess
to borrow her car.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.454
How's Dixie?

22:05.498 --> 22:06.499
Still running tests.

22:06.542 --> 22:08.283
Good, good.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.807
Good.

22:10.851 --> 22:13.375
Look, um,
I was talking to Murphy,

22:13.419 --> 22:15.334
and we think it's probably best
to just

22:15.377 --> 22:17.205
pop by the police station,
make sure that they know

22:17.248 --> 22:19.816
the truck isn't
technically ours, you know.

22:19.860 --> 22:22.428
Oh, you were talking
to Murphy. Cool.

22:22.471 --> 22:24.212
Another one of your
private conversations?

22:24.255 --> 22:25.518
It wasn't private.

22:25.561 --> 22:29.478
It was just, like, you
weren't there anymore.

22:29.522 --> 22:31.306
Look, we just want
to make sure

22:31.350 --> 22:32.525
that they don't think
we stole the truck.

22:32.568 --> 22:35.397
Just a precaution.

22:35.441 --> 22:37.747
Okay.Okay.

22:37.791 --> 22:41.838
Oh, uh, can we use your car?

22:51.892 --> 22:53.154
Well, is there a way in?

22:56.549 --> 22:57.854
No.

22:57.898 --> 23:00.379
Cool.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.816
I think we should just go.

23:02.859 --> 23:04.557
Cut our losses.
Felix,

23:04.600 --> 23:07.211
I'm gonna need you to not be
a little bitch for a second.

23:07.255 --> 23:09.083
Whoa, that--Okay? Come on.

23:09.126 --> 23:10.693
There's got to be a way in,
so think of something.

23:10.737 --> 23:12.086
You're smart.

23:12.129 --> 23:14.436
I'm actually not that smart,
I just work very hard.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.698
It's my deepest, darkest secret.

23:15.742 --> 23:17.439
Okay, well, how are
the other cars getting in?

23:17.483 --> 23:19.006
There's, like, a couple
of tow trucks

23:19.049 --> 23:21.312
being checked in
by some guard.

23:21.356 --> 23:24.054
[Murphy sighs heavily]

23:24.098 --> 23:26.535
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

23:31.061 --> 23:34.413
Okay, listen.

23:34.456 --> 23:38.721
On my go, we're gonna get out
of the car inconspicuously

23:38.765 --> 23:40.506
and walk along the fence.

23:40.549 --> 23:42.246
Okay?
We're just gonna
walk on?

23:42.290 --> 23:45.424
We're gonna sneak on.

23:47.469 --> 23:50.254
Wow, I should call you
a little bitch more often.

23:52.256 --> 23:54.302
Ben?

23:56.391 --> 23:57.479
Ben!

23:57.523 --> 24:00.177
Hey.JESS: Hi.

24:00.221 --> 24:02.832
Wha... What's... what's up?

24:02.876 --> 24:06.053
Can you watch Dixie
just for another sec, please?

24:14.365 --> 24:17.499
[sighs sharply]

24:17.543 --> 24:18.935
What am I even looking for?

24:20.981 --> 24:24.201
Stop sending me
to voice mail.

24:24.245 --> 24:26.377
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

24:26.421 --> 24:27.988
JESS: Listen, I need you
to call me back,

24:28.031 --> 24:29.293
'cause I know there's something going on between you guys,

24:29.337 --> 24:31.034
cand I don't know what it is,
but it--

24:31.078 --> 24:34.342
well, it sucks. So please,
please call me back.

24:36.692 --> 24:38.520
Come here. Come here.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.000
What? Wait.

24:40.043 --> 24:42.393
There's a van there. Get in,
get in. Come here, Pretz.

24:42.437 --> 24:44.570
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!Okay, okay.

24:49.575 --> 24:51.751
FELIX [excited whisper]:
We did it. We did it!

24:51.794 --> 24:54.188
We are so far
from being done.

24:54.231 --> 24:56.756
I know, but I feel good, I feel
like we can actually do this.

24:56.799 --> 24:59.454
Wait, something's wet.Ew.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.543
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

25:01.587 --> 25:04.328
Oh, my God!
What?

25:04.372 --> 25:07.288
I think someone was
murdered in here.

25:07.331 --> 25:08.332
What?

25:08.376 --> 25:11.422
There's, like...
blood everywhere,

25:11.466 --> 25:13.381
and bullet holes and...

25:13.424 --> 25:15.905
p... pieces of hair and scalp!

25:15.949 --> 25:16.950
What?Hair.

25:18.995 --> 25:20.693
[retching loudly]

25:20.736 --> 25:23.347
No. No, no, no.

25:23.391 --> 25:25.262
[continues retching]

25:26.394 --> 25:28.614
[Felix panting]

25:32.443 --> 25:33.401
I vomited.

25:33.444 --> 25:36.622
Yeah. I heard.

25:36.665 --> 25:39.712
It's okay, I made it all
into the backpack.

25:39.755 --> 25:43.585
Felix, we were supposed
to put the drugs in there.

25:43.629 --> 25:46.501
Oh, I'm sorry I puked, Murphy.

25:46.545 --> 25:49.112
Is there anything
not wrong with you?[Felix chuckles]

25:49.156 --> 25:52.594
You literally don't even know
how to stop being mean to me,

25:52.638 --> 25:53.856
even in thissituation.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.815
It's-it's-it's, you know,
it's unbelievable.

25:55.858 --> 25:57.251
Seriously?
Yeah.

25:57.294 --> 25:58.948
You really want to have
this conversation right now?

25:58.992 --> 26:00.863
Yeah, I really want to know.
Come on.

26:00.907 --> 26:02.822
What is it about me
that you've always hated?

26:02.865 --> 26:04.432
Oh, I just think it's funny that

26:04.475 --> 26:06.477
you think I'm the one
who started all of this.

26:06.521 --> 26:08.044
[laughs]
I'm sorry.

26:08.088 --> 26:09.872
I'm sorry, what?You really want to know?

26:09.916 --> 26:11.352
Yes, I really want to know.

26:11.395 --> 26:12.483
You really want to know?I reallywant to know.

26:12.527 --> 26:16.444
Fine! Fine, Felix.

26:16.487 --> 26:18.881
You were a dick to me
from the moment you started

26:18.925 --> 26:20.535
working at Guiding Hope.
You know that?

26:20.579 --> 26:22.929
[laughs]You literally tried to get

26:22.972 --> 26:25.932
my own parents to fire me.

26:25.975 --> 26:28.021
You're judgmental,
you're condescending,

26:28.064 --> 26:31.067
and you think you're better
than everyone else.

26:31.111 --> 26:34.941
So, yeah, I haven't been
the biggest fan of yours.

26:34.984 --> 26:38.031
[tow truck engine revs]

26:38.074 --> 26:39.119
Shh.

26:49.999 --> 26:52.480
Ben.

26:52.523 --> 26:53.524
Where's Dixie?

26:58.268 --> 26:59.922
Oh, my God.

26:59.966 --> 27:01.663
[tow truck stops]

27:04.231 --> 27:07.016
WOMAN:
Come to the office, I've got
some paperwork for you.

27:07.060 --> 27:08.714
DRIVER:
Right behind you.[door shuts]

27:08.757 --> 27:10.106
Okay,,,

27:10.150 --> 27:12.326
Now. Now, now, now.

27:12.369 --> 27:13.370
Get out?Go, go, go.

27:23.337 --> 27:26.775
All right, follow me.
Come on.

27:31.258 --> 27:33.564
Go.I'm trying.

27:38.091 --> 27:41.050
Yes! Get down. Okay.

27:41.094 --> 27:43.357
Okay...

27:43.400 --> 27:44.445
Get down.
Get down, Pretzel.

27:44.488 --> 27:46.012
Get down. Shh.

27:46.055 --> 27:48.014
Uh, where do we put it?
Where do we put it?

27:48.057 --> 27:49.624
Can you fit it
in your pants?

27:49.668 --> 27:51.974
No, I wore skinny jeans today.You're wearing skinny jeans?

27:52.018 --> 27:55.064
And we're specifically looking
for a cell phone or computer,

27:55.108 --> 27:56.936
but log anything that can
link back to Nia.

27:56.979 --> 27:58.807
Okay.

28:03.377 --> 28:04.987
Murphy?

28:14.083 --> 28:19.132
We've been shouting
for, like, an hour in here,

28:19.175 --> 28:21.134
and nobody heard us.

28:21.177 --> 28:22.875
You-you think you can just
tow people away?

28:22.918 --> 28:24.137
You want us to believe
that you've been in there

28:24.180 --> 28:25.660
since it was towed
from Guiding Hope?

28:25.704 --> 28:27.401
Yes.

28:27.444 --> 28:29.403
Your idiot tow driver
didn't even think

28:29.446 --> 28:30.926
to check the back, like,
I don't know,

28:30.970 --> 28:33.320
maybe there were
living beings inside.

28:33.363 --> 28:34.756
You weren't stuck.

28:34.800 --> 28:35.975
You could have just
easily walked out.

28:36.018 --> 28:38.629
We-we didn't want
to break the law, sir.

28:38.673 --> 28:40.675
What were you doing
in the van?

28:40.719 --> 28:42.677
Working.We were working.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.767
Moving in shampoos,
conditioners, et cetera.

28:45.811 --> 28:47.726
I mean, as you can see,
we've converted

28:47.769 --> 28:49.989
ye olde truck into...What's in the backpack?

28:50.032 --> 28:52.078
Sorry?

28:52.121 --> 28:54.036
The-the backpack.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.299
That's where I know
you guys from.
What?

28:56.343 --> 28:59.433
The-the litter kids.
They-they brought me litter.

29:00.869 --> 29:02.349
Did Max send you here?

29:02.392 --> 29:03.872
FELIX: What?Give me the backpack, Felix.

29:03.916 --> 29:06.614
I'm not sure...

29:06.657 --> 29:07.789
Give me the backpack, Felix.

29:14.013 --> 29:15.928
Oh, God!

29:15.971 --> 29:17.930
Yeah, I'm so--

29:17.973 --> 29:19.627
Sorry. Bumpy ride.All right, get out of the van.

29:19.670 --> 29:21.542
It's been seized as evidence.
Let's go.

29:21.585 --> 29:22.630
Let's go!

29:22.673 --> 29:25.546
There's a step
in front of you.

29:25.589 --> 29:27.853
Another step. Okay.

29:27.896 --> 29:28.854
Don't touch me. I got it.Pat 'em down.

29:28.897 --> 29:30.551
I'll take her.

29:30.594 --> 29:32.205
[sighs]

29:39.038 --> 29:41.388
Can we go now?

29:41.431 --> 29:43.433
No. I'm taking you in.

29:43.477 --> 29:45.958
Uh, one sec.

29:50.614 --> 29:51.833
We can't bring them in.

29:51.877 --> 29:53.922
Why not?And charge 'em for what?

29:53.966 --> 29:55.358
Being in the van?

29:55.402 --> 29:59.014
After that raid last night,
dude, we can't.

30:01.016 --> 30:02.713
Dixie!

30:03.889 --> 30:06.108
Dixie!

30:06.152 --> 30:08.719
[panting]

30:08.763 --> 30:10.678
Dixie!STERLING:
I see things

30:10.721 --> 30:12.811
over here are going super well.

30:13.855 --> 30:17.119
Yeah, um, Ben lost the dog.

30:17.163 --> 30:19.513
Well, I-I... I lost the dog.

30:19.556 --> 30:20.731
I lost the dog. Uh...

30:20.775 --> 30:22.603
And I-I've been looking
everywhere for her

30:22.646 --> 30:24.126
and I don't know where she is
and I-- Frank's gonna kill me.

30:24.170 --> 30:26.389
I mean, he should kill me
because I-I lost his dog, so...

30:26.433 --> 30:27.913
Jess.

30:27.956 --> 30:30.306
We'll find her. These are, like,

30:30.350 --> 30:32.874
the most well-trained dogs
in the universe.

30:32.918 --> 30:35.137
She didn't go far.

30:48.107 --> 30:50.500
Oh, my God.
[laughs]

30:50.544 --> 30:52.328
Oh, my God.

30:52.372 --> 30:54.026
Oh, my God!

30:54.069 --> 30:56.115
[laughs]:
Oh, my God.
Wow.

30:57.159 --> 30:59.466
We did that.

30:59.509 --> 31:00.946
Youdid that.

31:00.989 --> 31:02.164
That was awesome.

31:02.208 --> 31:03.513
You did it.

31:03.557 --> 31:05.559
You did it, Pretzel.

31:05.602 --> 31:07.387
That's a good boy.

31:07.430 --> 31:09.389
So proud of you.

31:11.434 --> 31:12.783
Huh?

31:12.827 --> 31:13.959
Okay, yeah, no.

31:14.002 --> 31:17.049
Let's not bring
the heroin out, please.

31:20.182 --> 31:21.923
Crazy.

31:21.967 --> 31:23.055
Look, um,

31:23.098 --> 31:25.318
about what you
were saying...

31:25.361 --> 31:26.754
What?

31:26.797 --> 31:29.975
In the murder van? About me?

31:30.018 --> 31:31.977
You're right--
I, um,

31:32.020 --> 31:36.503
I try so hard to be
the opposite of my mother

31:36.546 --> 31:40.072
and then I become
exactly like my mother.

31:40.115 --> 31:42.944
No.
And I'm... sorry.

31:42.988 --> 31:44.772
Felix, you're not like your mom.

31:44.815 --> 31:45.991
I am, I am.
No, you're not.

31:46.034 --> 31:47.209
She-- I mean,
I don't know her.

31:47.253 --> 31:49.603
But she seems
awful and...

31:49.646 --> 31:50.821
[sighs]

31:50.865 --> 31:52.040
...you're not.

31:52.084 --> 31:54.956
I think we just
misjudged each other.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.740
And, I mean...

31:56.784 --> 31:59.308
now that I know you,
I realize you're not...

31:59.352 --> 32:01.658
[chuckles]
...you're not mean at all.

32:01.702 --> 32:03.095
You're just incredibly insecure.

32:03.138 --> 32:04.400
Yeah, I am.

32:04.444 --> 32:05.445
Thank you.

32:05.488 --> 32:08.100
You're an insecure little bitch.

32:08.143 --> 32:10.363
[laughs]

32:10.406 --> 32:11.625
Yeah.

32:14.802 --> 32:15.846
Dixie!

32:15.890 --> 32:16.891
You know,
it's pointless.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.023
She's probably just...

32:18.066 --> 32:19.633
She's probably
walking home.

32:19.676 --> 32:20.939
And that's on
the other side of town.

32:20.982 --> 32:22.157
So we'll just...

32:22.201 --> 32:25.073
Or she's right
behind that dumpster.

32:25.117 --> 32:26.814
[Dixie whining]

32:26.857 --> 32:28.424
Oh, my God, Dixie.

32:28.468 --> 32:30.949
Hi.

32:30.992 --> 32:34.082
Hi, baby, are you okay?[whining]

32:34.126 --> 32:37.042
Hi.

32:37.085 --> 32:39.958
Are you okay?

32:40.001 --> 32:41.133
[Dixie whines]

32:41.176 --> 32:43.483
I know,
you were so scared

32:43.526 --> 32:45.528
and I'm so sorry.

32:48.009 --> 32:50.969
[crying]:
I'm so sorry.

33:11.554 --> 33:14.253
[exhales]

33:14.296 --> 33:16.777
Quite a day.

33:16.820 --> 33:19.301
[both laugh]

33:19.345 --> 33:20.172
Yeah.

33:20.215 --> 33:22.783
I could use a drink.

33:24.176 --> 33:25.220
Oh, my God!

33:25.264 --> 33:27.266
What?I forgot about Josh.

33:27.309 --> 33:29.137
IRS Josh?
Yes.

33:29.181 --> 33:31.792
Murphy, you can't blow that
guy off like any other guy.

33:31.835 --> 33:33.489
No, it's not...

33:33.533 --> 33:34.838
It's just casual drinks.

33:34.882 --> 33:37.015
I'll go right now.

33:37.058 --> 33:39.321
[exhales]

33:39.365 --> 33:41.062
All right.

33:41.106 --> 33:43.717
Sure you don't want
me to wait with you?

33:43.760 --> 33:45.632
Uh, no, I...

33:45.675 --> 33:48.069
My Uber's gonna be here
in, like, ten minutes.

33:48.113 --> 33:49.723
Okay.

33:49.766 --> 33:52.291
Well, keep me updated on Josh.

33:52.334 --> 33:54.162
You know,
within reason.

33:54.206 --> 33:56.860
It's not,
it's not like that.

33:56.904 --> 33:57.948
Sure.

33:57.992 --> 33:58.993
He can destroy
us all.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.255
Just remember that.

34:00.299 --> 34:01.778
Got it, thanks.

34:01.822 --> 34:03.824
Oh. Lie down.

34:05.391 --> 34:07.393
[door closes]

34:09.177 --> 34:12.006
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Opening Uber app.

34:14.530 --> 34:16.532
[door opens]

34:18.143 --> 34:19.100
Hello?

34:19.144 --> 34:22.190
It's Darnell.

34:22.234 --> 34:24.323
Oh.

34:24.366 --> 34:25.367
Hi.

34:25.411 --> 34:28.718
Is anyone else here?

34:28.762 --> 34:29.806
No.

34:29.850 --> 34:31.112
What's going on?

34:31.156 --> 34:33.593
You guys are working with Nia?

34:33.636 --> 34:35.682
How did that
even happen?

34:35.725 --> 34:38.163
She told us not to tell anyone.

34:38.206 --> 34:40.643
And it's not
like we volunteered.

34:40.687 --> 34:43.385
Sam held us
at gunpoint.

34:43.429 --> 34:46.345
[sighs] Of course she did.

34:46.388 --> 34:48.390
So, she's keeping
all her product here?

34:53.003 --> 34:54.048
What do you care?

34:54.092 --> 34:55.310
You don't even work
for her anymore.

34:55.354 --> 34:56.398
Yeah, I do.

34:57.791 --> 35:00.620
She never had any intention
of letting me walk.

35:00.663 --> 35:02.578
[sighs]

35:02.622 --> 35:06.321
I know the feeling.

35:08.323 --> 35:10.934
Look, I-I, I may be able
to get us out of this.

35:12.284 --> 35:14.155
Really?

35:14.199 --> 35:16.331
I started working
with someone else.

35:16.375 --> 35:18.246
Someone who can take Nia down

35:18.290 --> 35:19.595
if you just help
me get the--

35:19.639 --> 35:21.031
Hang on, hang on. I...

35:21.075 --> 35:24.948
I can't, I can't work
for somebody else.

35:24.992 --> 35:26.646
Nia and I made a deal.

35:26.689 --> 35:28.082
And she kept it.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.214
What deal?

35:29.257 --> 35:31.346
To keep Max safe.

35:31.390 --> 35:33.305
You think he's safe?

35:33.348 --> 35:35.176
Murphy, you don't get it.

35:35.220 --> 35:36.351
Max may be inside,

35:36.395 --> 35:38.266
but he still works for Nia.

35:41.095 --> 35:42.836
All I know is that...

35:42.879 --> 35:45.360
he's alive.

35:45.404 --> 35:49.712
And if you want to turn on Nia,
that's on you.

35:49.756 --> 35:52.454
But it's too risky.

35:52.498 --> 35:54.108
I'm sorry.

35:55.327 --> 35:57.198
I get it.

35:57.242 --> 35:59.244
I had to try.

36:01.246 --> 36:02.334
Wait, you're not gonna--

36:02.377 --> 36:04.379
Come on, I'm not gonna
tell anyone.

36:05.728 --> 36:07.426
Just make sure we don't
go down with the ship.

36:07.469 --> 36:10.429
I'd never do that to you guys.

36:12.648 --> 36:14.650
â™ª

36:19.307 --> 36:21.309
[buzzing]

36:22.658 --> 36:24.660
[buzzing continues]

36:36.585 --> 36:39.588
[buzzing]

36:50.295 --> 36:52.297
Hello?

36:52.340 --> 36:53.776
MALE VOICE:
Client list is on the phone.

36:53.820 --> 36:55.909
Same again in a couple days.

36:55.952 --> 36:57.606
What? Who is this?[phone beeps]

37:20.542 --> 37:22.675
Oh, there she is.

37:22.718 --> 37:25.068
Oh, hey. Hi.

37:25.112 --> 37:27.593
Um...

37:27.636 --> 37:29.072
Sorry, uh...

37:29.116 --> 37:31.205
sorry, we had kind of,
like, a situation at work.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.511
But... [clears throat]
How are you?

37:32.554 --> 37:35.165
I'm great, I'm great.

37:35.209 --> 37:36.558
Yeah? [laughs]

37:36.602 --> 37:38.212
You seem better than
the last time I saw you.

37:38.256 --> 37:39.387
Well, because...

37:39.431 --> 37:40.519
Look.

37:40.562 --> 37:42.042
I sort of can't.

37:42.085 --> 37:44.740
Oh, yeah,
you know what I mean.

37:44.784 --> 37:47.613
I figured out a way
to get my phone

37:47.656 --> 37:50.442
to read Excel files.

37:50.485 --> 37:52.792
Yeah? That's top notch.

37:52.835 --> 37:57.623
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Case file 34562 Henry Gottfried.

37:57.666 --> 38:01.322
Case file 34563 Nia Bailey.

38:01.366 --> 38:03.324
Anyway, you get it.

38:04.543 --> 38:05.718
[clears throat]

38:05.761 --> 38:08.198
That's so cool.

38:08.242 --> 38:09.504
Um...

38:09.548 --> 38:12.028
wh-what did you
say that was?

38:12.072 --> 38:13.465
Oh, just-just for work.

38:13.508 --> 38:16.685
I had, like, a list
of all my case files.

38:16.729 --> 38:17.991
Anyway, I know it's stupid,

38:18.034 --> 38:21.081
but...

38:21.124 --> 38:23.213
I was, I was, uh,

38:23.257 --> 38:25.215
I was pretty
proud of myself.

38:25.259 --> 38:26.304
Hmm.

38:27.957 --> 38:29.219
Uh, I'm so sorry...
[stammers]

38:29.263 --> 38:30.699
Can I, do you...

38:30.743 --> 38:32.179
do you want a drink?

38:34.616 --> 38:35.661
STERLING:
You okay?

38:35.704 --> 38:38.881
Yeah, I'm fine.

38:38.925 --> 38:40.753
Sorry about earlier.

38:40.796 --> 38:42.363
Sorry for what?

38:42.407 --> 38:45.018
No, I did--
not sorry, I just, uh...

38:45.061 --> 38:46.933
I just... [laughs]

38:46.976 --> 38:48.717
I don't want you
to think I'm crazy,

38:48.761 --> 38:49.718
even though
you probably already do.

38:49.762 --> 38:52.025
And, uh, that whole, um,

38:52.068 --> 38:53.374
insane breakdown thing
was only

38:53.418 --> 38:54.593
partially
about the dog.

38:54.636 --> 38:56.159
Yeah, I figured.

38:56.203 --> 38:59.032
There's just a lot going on
in my life right now.

39:03.993 --> 39:05.125
I got into...

39:05.168 --> 39:08.041
some bad... stuff.

39:08.084 --> 39:09.347
Like, really, really bad.

39:09.390 --> 39:12.350
And, and you're, you,

39:12.393 --> 39:14.134
you are... perfect.

39:14.177 --> 39:15.831
No, I'm not perfect.

39:15.875 --> 39:17.224
Yes, you are,
you're perfect.

39:17.267 --> 39:18.573
And I don't,
I don't want you

39:18.617 --> 39:21.141
I don't want you getting
mixed up in it, so...

39:21.184 --> 39:23.448
Mixed up in, in what?

39:23.491 --> 39:25.798
What are you
talking about?

39:29.236 --> 39:31.499
I can't tell you.

39:31.543 --> 39:34.807
I'm sorry.

39:34.850 --> 39:37.375
It's-it's-it's...

39:37.418 --> 39:39.899
it's not good.

39:39.942 --> 39:41.291
It's okay.

39:41.335 --> 39:43.424
You don't, you don't
have to tell me.

39:43.468 --> 39:44.947
But, um...

39:44.991 --> 39:47.646
I do know one thing.

39:50.736 --> 39:52.781
I'm not going
anywhere.

39:56.306 --> 39:58.352
[distant sirens wail]

40:04.837 --> 40:07.100
JESS:
Hey.

40:07.143 --> 40:09.711
Oh, hey.

40:09.755 --> 40:12.932
How were your drinks
with Josh?

40:12.975 --> 40:15.369
Um... fine.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.544
Yeah, it was good.

40:16.588 --> 40:17.806
Where's your lover?

40:17.850 --> 40:19.721
She just left.

40:19.765 --> 40:22.594
Okay, well, I'm really
tired, so I'm out.

40:22.637 --> 40:24.204
Murphy, we need to talk, um...

40:24.247 --> 40:26.859
Come on.

40:26.902 --> 40:27.947
Okay, you,

40:27.990 --> 40:30.471
you and Felix
have been acting so,

40:30.515 --> 40:32.778
so weird all day,
and I can tell

40:32.821 --> 40:34.693
when you're not telling me
something, so please...

40:34.736 --> 40:36.738
please tell me.

40:38.392 --> 40:41.482
I just f-felt bad.

40:41.526 --> 40:43.615
Okay?

40:43.658 --> 40:45.225
[sighs]

40:45.268 --> 40:47.706
I know how hopeful you were
about getting out and...

40:47.749 --> 40:51.405
I hate when you're sad, so I...

40:51.449 --> 40:53.102
avoided you.

40:53.146 --> 40:56.410
You need to stop...

40:56.454 --> 40:59.369
avoiding me even when I'm sad.

40:59.413 --> 41:02.808
You need to be okay
with human emotions.

41:04.331 --> 41:05.854
Yeah.

41:05.898 --> 41:07.334
I'll try.

41:14.689 --> 41:17.866
I'm really sorry.

41:17.910 --> 41:20.521
You don't need to be sorry.

41:20.565 --> 41:21.696
Okay.

41:21.740 --> 41:23.742
[chuckles]

41:25.526 --> 41:27.876
[distant siren wails]

41:27.920 --> 41:29.922
Hey.

41:32.185 --> 41:33.839
How's everything going
over there?

41:33.882 --> 41:36.232
It's all good.

41:36.276 --> 41:37.277
Want to grab a drink?

41:37.320 --> 41:38.757
Can't do my rounds until, uh,

41:38.800 --> 41:41.324
later tonight
after Felix finally leaves.

41:41.368 --> 41:44.023
You mean I don't have
to share you with Jess tonight?

41:44.066 --> 41:46.504
[laughs]

41:46.547 --> 41:48.506
Shut up.
