Ben did this to us.

[train rattling]

00:10.097 --> 00:11.533
I can.

[sighs]

00:22.109 --> 00:23.501
Felix, what-what i-is...

00:23.545 --> 00:25.808
We need to talk. Wake Murphy up.

00:28.115 --> 00:30.334
So, how was your guys' night
last night?

00:30.378 --> 00:32.336
'Cause I nearly drowned.

00:33.381 --> 00:35.426
Where?
In a toilet.

00:35.470 --> 00:37.385
What?

00:37.428 --> 00:39.822
FELIX:
It's...
This is serious, Jessica.

00:39.865 --> 00:41.302
It was one of Nia's guys.

00:41.345 --> 00:43.434
I have no idea how he found out,
but I skimmed some money

00:43.478 --> 00:44.827
from the stash or whatever...

00:44.870 --> 00:46.742
Wait, what?
You skimmed money?

00:46.785 --> 00:48.352
Oh, my God.Felix...

00:48.396 --> 00:50.224
Yes, yes, Jessica, I did.
I skimmed some money.

00:50.267 --> 00:52.835
Because unlike you two, I can't
just have sex whenever I want.

00:52.878 --> 00:55.446
You paid Chelsea
to have sex with you?

00:55.490 --> 00:56.752
No. I took her to a restaurant.

00:56.795 --> 01:00.669
My point is that I don't
want to do this anymore.

01:00.712 --> 01:03.889
It sucks.
I just, I want my life back.

01:03.933 --> 01:05.326
Well, there's
no way out.

01:05.369 --> 01:06.979
Well,

01:07.023 --> 01:09.895
we can't go to the cops because
they're protecting Dean, right?

01:09.939 --> 01:12.463
But what if we go to the feds?

01:13.508 --> 01:14.857
You want to go to the FBI?

01:14.900 --> 01:18.165
Yes. Look, if we turn
ourselves in, we might be able

01:18.208 --> 01:19.775
to prove that we were forced
into this

01:19.818 --> 01:22.125
and get some sort
of cooperation agreement.

01:22.169 --> 01:24.388
We could, we could do that?Maybe.

01:24.432 --> 01:27.217
Maybe. I mean, you know,
i-it's extremely risky.

01:27.261 --> 01:28.349
Nia could retaliate,

01:28.392 --> 01:30.786
but Murphy says
she's not that stupid?

01:30.829 --> 01:33.658
Hmm.So, I put in a call

01:33.702 --> 01:35.660
to my college roommate
who is a defense attorney.

01:35.704 --> 01:36.879
We'll see what he says.

01:36.922 --> 01:38.489
Okay. That's great.

01:38.533 --> 01:39.795
I mean, we...

01:39.838 --> 01:41.188
What did we even do?

01:41.231 --> 01:43.146
I mean, we just laundered money
for, like, a month.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.713
It's not that big a deal.
And I'm done

01:44.756 --> 01:46.236
letting people walk all over me.

01:46.280 --> 01:49.370
Done.Yes. Yes, yes, Felix.

01:49.413 --> 01:51.589

Okay.

01:52.851 --> 01:54.418
This is great.This is great.

01:54.462 --> 01:55.811
It could be great.Yeah.

01:55.854 --> 01:57.029
Okay.Yeah.

01:57.073 --> 01:59.162
I don't want to get
my hopes up but, um,

01:59.206 --> 02:00.511
I'm gonna go take a shower.

02:00.555 --> 02:02.426
Okay.

This is good.

We'll just pretend they're not
there until they're not there.

We have to tell Jess.
No!

No.

03:20.025 --> 03:22.245
No. She's, like, attached
at the hip to Sterling right now

and she's gonna have a meltdown
and she's gonna tell her.

I don't want you talking to her.

to talk to her.

He's pissed about the raid.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.906
So Max Parish
played us?

05:41.950 --> 05:44.344
No. I think he made
a deal with Nia.

It's the only possible reason
he'd still be alive.

Gotta find where
she moved those drugs.

for Max Parish's apartment.

his phone,

more of Nia's contacts.

U-Uh, it wasn't
a big deal, but I...

I need to be able
to read to do my job.

06:39.834 --> 06:42.445
So is there, like,
a trick to help me?

06:42.489 --> 06:44.186
Or... I actually read
that you can put the material

06:44.229 --> 06:47.363
in the middle...You know what?
There is, actually.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.713
The trick is you admit
you're going blind,

06:49.757 --> 06:53.021
and you have your phone
read everything for you.

06:53.064 --> 06:54.762
I just don't think
I'm there yet.

06:54.805 --> 06:57.329
I know it sucks.

that helps.

to report back that I, uh...

took care of that
Josiah message.

you did what I asked you to do?

give us the address,

10:03.603 --> 10:05.735
So we just wait?

10:05.779 --> 10:07.694
I guess so.

10:08.695 --> 10:09.957
Cool.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.480
FRANK:
She hasn't had
much of an appetite,

10:11.523 --> 10:14.483
and she doesn't call as
quickly as she used to, so...

10:14.526 --> 10:17.138
I'm not sure.
I just got a little worried.

10:18.182 --> 10:20.576
Yeah. Uh, okay.

10:20.620 --> 10:25.146
Yes, um, uh, I-I'll run some
tests and see what's going on.

10:25.189 --> 10:26.626
Thanks.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.542
[sighs]

10:30.586 --> 10:31.718
[door thuds]

10:31.761 --> 10:33.415
[door handle jiggles]

10:33.458 --> 10:35.025
What was that?

10:35.069 --> 10:36.461
Someone's
trying to get in.

10:36.505 --> 10:38.420
[knocking on door]

10:42.554 --> 10:44.165
Hi!

10:45.209 --> 10:46.428
Jess...

10:46.471 --> 10:49.126
Sorry.Guys, what's going on?

10:49.170 --> 10:50.432
I know there's something
you're not telling me,

10:50.475 --> 10:51.694
because you two don't
even like each other,

10:51.738 --> 10:52.782
and now you're
hanging out all day?

10:52.826 --> 10:54.218
I love Murphy.I like Felix.

10:54.262 --> 10:55.829
I likeMurphy.

10:57.482 --> 10:58.701
You talked to the lawyer,

10:58.745 --> 11:00.660
and you don't want
to tell me bad news.

11:00.703 --> 11:03.575
Just please give it to
me. I can take it.

11:03.619 --> 11:06.361
Yeah, we-- [sighs]
It wasn't great.

11:06.404 --> 11:07.710
Um...Yeah...

11:07.754 --> 11:09.669
He said we're sort of
stuck in this for now.

11:09.712 --> 11:13.585
[sighs] Okay.
Wh-- What did he say, exactly?

11:13.629 --> 11:17.067
[inhales] Just that it would be
really hard to prove

11:17.111 --> 11:19.896
that we were forced into it.

11:19.940 --> 11:21.071
I'm really sorry, Jess.

11:21.115 --> 11:23.770
Okay. [exhales]

11:23.813 --> 11:25.859
Well, um...

11:25.902 --> 11:27.687
Thank you for at least trying.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.906
Yeah, of course.

11:29.950 --> 11:32.779
[door closes]

11:32.822 --> 11:34.563
[exhales]

11:34.606 --> 11:36.391
[whistle blows]

11:36.434 --> 11:39.133
[indistinct chatter]

11:45.530 --> 11:47.184
Do you care if
I sit here?

11:47.228 --> 11:49.273
Sure.

11:49.317 --> 11:51.232
Who is that?

11:51.275 --> 11:53.451
Amber.Oh, hi.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.498
Why aren't
you swimming?

11:56.541 --> 11:59.762
I just got my period.That sucks.

11:59.806 --> 12:00.807
Mm-hmm.

12:00.850 --> 12:03.592
Mine just ended.

12:03.635 --> 12:06.464
Oh, this is so boring.

12:06.508 --> 12:08.205
I can't believe
they won't even let us

12:08.249 --> 12:09.903
use our phones
if we can't swim.

12:09.946 --> 12:12.601
Like, what are we
supposed to do?

12:12.644 --> 12:16.387
I don't know. My dad took
mine away this morning anyway.

12:16.431 --> 12:19.086
[chuckling]:
Oh, my God, he did?

12:19.129 --> 12:20.087
I would die.

12:20.130 --> 12:24.439
Yeah, I sort of am.

12:24.482 --> 12:25.701
Ugh, this sucks.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.269
Let's ditch
and go get nachos.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.358
Now?

12:30.401 --> 12:31.751
Yeah.

12:34.797 --> 12:38.540
This dude's got condoms
in every room.

12:41.195 --> 12:42.674
Extra large. Yeah, all right.

12:42.718 --> 12:43.806
What you got, man?

12:55.426 --> 12:57.298
Well, there aren't
any contacts here.

12:57.341 --> 13:01.432
There's nothing here.
Not even a phone.

13:01.476 --> 13:03.826
He must've kept his
important stuff somewhere else.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.610
[phone rings]

13:06.524 --> 13:09.353
Detective Riley.

13:10.485 --> 13:13.357
Wait... Chloe did what?

13:14.968 --> 13:16.447
How many?

13:16.491 --> 13:17.797
Five.

13:23.585 --> 13:25.630
FELIX:
Okay.You have five?

13:25.674 --> 13:27.937
Yes, Murphy.
I know how to count.

13:27.981 --> 13:31.245
Pretzel.
Come on.

13:31.288 --> 13:33.116
Okay, good boy. Forward.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.640
Oh, crap. We have to take
the grooming truck.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.512
Why?
Because Jess
drove us, remember?

13:37.555 --> 13:39.166
DEAN:
Hi.

13:39.209 --> 13:40.341
Where's Chloe?

13:43.431 --> 13:45.433
Felix, this doesn't
concern you, please leave.

13:47.261 --> 13:49.176
Chloe? Chloe!

13:49.219 --> 13:50.220
MURPHY: She's not
here, you psycho.

13:51.352 --> 13:53.310
I know she cut class to see you.

13:53.354 --> 13:54.572
Yeah, and don't you think
if she was here,

13:54.616 --> 13:56.009
she'd bewith me?

13:56.879 --> 13:59.447
Leave her alone.

13:59.490 --> 14:02.754
Don't text her,
don't call her, just stop.

14:02.798 --> 14:05.932
[exhales]

14:35.135 --> 14:36.788
Gene.

14:36.832 --> 14:39.748
I think I might know
where some of Max's stuff is.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.450
FELIX:
Murphy, that was way too close.
I was face to face with a cop,

14:46.494 --> 14:47.582
with a bunch of drugs in my bag.

14:47.625 --> 14:50.324
If we're actually
moving this stuff,

14:50.367 --> 14:52.543
we have to do it after hours,
when no one else is around.

14:52.587 --> 14:53.980
Okay, Felix, yeah.
I'll just tell Nia

14:54.023 --> 14:55.807
this doesn't really work
with your schedule.

14:58.723 --> 15:00.116
It's 2:30.
Why aren't they calling?

15:00.160 --> 15:01.901
I don't know.It's gonna take more
than a half hour

15:01.944 --> 15:04.077
to get to the city,
plus traffic.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.339
I just don't know
why we can't be more organized

15:05.382 --> 15:06.340
about it,
you know? Supposed to be...

15:06.383 --> 15:08.124
[banging on door] Ooh!

15:08.168 --> 15:08.951
Hey.Jess!

15:08.995 --> 15:11.954
Hi.
What's up?

15:11.998 --> 15:14.348
I saw you guys walking out, so--
Where are you going?

15:14.391 --> 15:16.654
Where are wegoing?

15:16.698 --> 15:17.917
Felix wanted a smoothie,

15:17.960 --> 15:19.657
and I was, like,
oh, that sounds good, so...

15:19.701 --> 15:22.530
Yeah. Just craving a smoothie.
Super weird.

15:22.573 --> 15:23.792
A smoothie?

15:23.835 --> 15:25.185
Yeah. I would've asked you,

15:25.228 --> 15:28.057
but you know, I know you're busy
with... Trixie...

15:28.101 --> 15:29.145
Dixie.Dixie.

15:29.189 --> 15:30.538
So I didn't ask you.

15:30.581 --> 15:32.018
But I would've, and I will.

15:32.061 --> 15:33.280
Next time.[phone buzzing]

15:33.323 --> 15:35.021
Um... yeah,

15:35.064 --> 15:36.457
we really got to go, though.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.981
But, um, just text me
if you want anything, okay?

15:41.853 --> 15:43.594
Love you.

15:45.118 --> 15:48.164
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Call from unknown number.Sorry.

15:48.208 --> 15:49.426
[whispering]:
That must be them.

15:49.470 --> 15:51.037
Yeah, no duh.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.039
Hello?

15:53.082 --> 15:55.215
Hill Heights Grocery.
Okay.

15:56.042 --> 16:00.437
Green Floret
Trucking.

16:00.481 --> 16:02.657
Truck number
5-6-4-3.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.572
Yeah, got it.
We'll be there.

16:04.615 --> 16:06.704
Okay.

16:08.097 --> 16:10.708
Okay.

16:10.752 --> 16:12.797
[exhales]

16:12.841 --> 16:13.885
[starts engine]

16:20.196 --> 16:21.545
Chloe Riley.

16:21.589 --> 16:24.026
What is going on? Now you
think you can cut class?

16:24.070 --> 16:25.419
Dad, it was nothing.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.029
Do not tell me
it was nothing.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.378
Now you're gonna march back
into that school,

16:28.422 --> 16:29.684
and then you're gonna
march home.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.164
Those are the only two places
you are gonna be

16:31.207 --> 16:32.382
for the next month, understand?

16:32.426 --> 16:34.080
Yes.
Good.

16:34.123 --> 16:35.472
Go back to class.

16:35.516 --> 16:38.127
[chuckles] That
was dramatic.

16:38.171 --> 16:41.217
Mr. Riley?
Mr. Riley.Hi.

16:41.261 --> 16:42.827
Hope Miranda.

16:42.871 --> 16:44.829
I'm, I'm the administrator.
Do you have a second?

16:44.873 --> 16:47.093
Uh-- No. Actually,
I have to head back to work.

16:47.136 --> 16:48.659
Oh. Okay.

16:48.703 --> 16:51.097
We just haven't received Chloe's
tuition for this semester,

16:51.140 --> 16:53.186
and we're two months in.
I just wanted to check in...

16:53.229 --> 16:55.753
Yeah, uh.. really?
Um... sorry about that.

16:55.797 --> 16:57.364
I will, uh, figure it out.

16:57.407 --> 17:00.193
I'll get it to you
as soon as possible, okay?Thank you.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.980
[phone ringing]

17:05.024 --> 17:07.809
Yeah.

17:07.852 --> 17:09.419
TREY:
She give you the new location
or what?

17:09.463 --> 17:11.639
Nah, but I'm handling it now.

17:11.682 --> 17:13.380
What? How?

17:13.423 --> 17:15.730
There's a weekly drop
I know she can't miss.

17:15.773 --> 17:18.689
Whoever drops off the product
will know where the stash is.

17:18.733 --> 17:21.823
And whoever does the drop
is just gonna tell you

17:21.866 --> 17:23.085
where it came from?

17:23.129 --> 17:25.435
Yeah.

17:25.479 --> 17:28.177
I'll make sure.

17:28.221 --> 17:31.789
TREY: Listen, man,
you'd better, or we're...Trey... I know.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.269
God...

17:38.535 --> 17:40.842
You got to be kidding me.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.934
[exhales]

17:45.977 --> 17:48.284
Come on...

17:53.289 --> 17:54.899
Here, I got that.What?

17:54.943 --> 17:56.379
I got that.

17:56.423 --> 17:57.815
Watch my back, okay?

17:57.859 --> 17:59.165
Yeah, I'll just
keep my eyes open.

17:59.208 --> 18:00.383
Hello.

18:02.211 --> 18:06.041
Uh, we're here for the...

18:06.085 --> 18:07.303
[quietly]:
delivery?

18:07.347 --> 18:09.740
Put it on the truck bed?

18:16.356 --> 18:18.619
What the hell is this?

18:18.662 --> 18:21.143
There's five. I counted.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.145
This is five bricks.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.886
Are you out of your mind?

18:24.929 --> 18:28.150
Sorry. Um...

18:28.194 --> 18:30.326
This is good.

18:30.370 --> 18:34.156
Don't ever bring that much
again, you idiots.

18:34.200 --> 18:38.682
Copy that. All right.

18:38.726 --> 18:42.077
Nice to, uh... Pleasure.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.861
Murphy, let's go.

18:48.953 --> 18:51.434
At least now we know
what a bundle is.

18:51.478 --> 18:55.221
Yeah. Five bundles
to a brick, apparently.

18:56.309 --> 18:58.615
Okay.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-
whoa-whoa.

18:58.659 --> 19:00.226
Not during business
hours, I told you.

19:00.269 --> 19:02.445
Felix.Give me that,
I'll hide it.

19:02.489 --> 19:03.533
My God.

19:03.577 --> 19:05.753
Are you serious?

19:05.796 --> 19:07.537
Just leave it in the bag,
let's go.

19:07.581 --> 19:08.886
That's suspicious.

19:08.930 --> 19:11.324
People obviously saw me
leave with a backpack.

19:11.367 --> 19:14.153
Do you think anyone cares enough
about you to notice that?

19:14.196 --> 19:17.112
Okay, sure.
Whatever.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.158
Okay, let's go.
Come on, Pretzel.

19:19.201 --> 19:22.204
Hey, Ben.

19:22.248 --> 19:23.466
What happened to
your backpack?

19:23.510 --> 19:28.384
Must've, uh, forgotten it.
I'll go grab it.

19:40.440 --> 19:43.660
"Do you think anybody
even notices you, Felix?"

19:43.704 --> 19:46.185
"Nobody even notices
what you do."

19:51.581 --> 19:53.757
Got it.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.803
Got what?

19:58.240 --> 20:02.723
No-- Get up. You should work,
we have to look normal.

20:02.766 --> 20:04.246
I ambeing normal.

20:04.290 --> 20:05.639
I know what you're doing.

20:05.682 --> 20:07.336
You know that if you
go to your desk,

20:07.380 --> 20:10.252
you're just gonna
pass Jess' office.

20:10.296 --> 20:11.384
That's not true.
Yes.

20:11.427 --> 20:12.646
It istrue,

20:12.689 --> 20:14.038
and I know this because
I'm holding in,

20:14.082 --> 20:16.606
like, a gallon of pee
for the exact same reason.

20:18.478 --> 20:20.436
I just hate
lying to her.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.525
At least you don't
have to see her face.

20:22.569 --> 20:25.441
Yes, Felix, what a gift
God has given me.

20:25.485 --> 20:28.575
[machinery whirring]

20:28.618 --> 20:30.968
What is--
What is that?

20:34.320 --> 20:37.192
[siren whoops]Whoa.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.237
Felix?

20:39.368 --> 20:42.066
[siren whoops]

20:48.638 --> 20:50.074
The cops can do that?
They can just take the truck?

20:50.118 --> 20:51.337
The truck is registered
to Max Parish,

20:51.380 --> 20:53.513
and they're using it
as evidence relevant

20:53.556 --> 20:57.647
to the commission of an act
of money laundering.

20:57.691 --> 21:00.520
So it's about Max,
not about us.Yeah, but...

21:00.563 --> 21:02.173
So there's nothing
to worry about.Yeah, yeah.

21:02.217 --> 21:03.653
Except for the fact that
they seized the truck

21:03.697 --> 21:05.264
we're using for money laundering
to investigate Max

21:05.307 --> 21:07.918
for money laundering.

21:07.962 --> 21:09.311
Oh, my God,
plus the gu-- the gun.

21:09.355 --> 21:11.226
You guys, there's a gun.
We have a gun on the truck.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.575
I moved it into my desk drawer

21:12.619 --> 21:14.577
after we started
getting actual customers.

21:14.621 --> 21:17.058
There's nothing on the truck
besides some shampoo.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.235
Okay?

21:20.279 --> 21:21.497
We'll just all act normal.

21:21.541 --> 21:23.369
It's fine. It's gonna be
fine, Jess, I promise.

21:23.412 --> 21:25.109
Mm-hmm, okay, I--

21:25.153 --> 21:27.111
Yeah.

21:31.986 --> 21:32.943
We are not fine.

21:32.987 --> 21:34.162
You don't think I know that?

21:34.205 --> 21:35.250
Thank you.

21:38.035 --> 21:39.036
That's a cute dog.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.864
Thanks.

21:42.605 --> 21:43.824
My prints are
on those drugs, Murphy.

21:43.867 --> 21:45.347
My prints are all over
those drugs.

21:45.391 --> 21:46.827
We're gonna figure
this out, okay?

21:46.870 --> 21:48.350
Murphy, the truck is
currently being towed

21:48.394 --> 21:51.135
to an impound lot,
where they will search it

21:51.179 --> 21:53.747
and they will find
so much heroin!

21:53.790 --> 21:56.315
It's over. It's over.
My life is over.

21:56.358 --> 21:58.534
It's not over. Go ask Jess
to borrow her car.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.454
How's Dixie?

22:05.498 --> 22:06.499
Still running tests.

22:06.542 --> 22:08.283
Good, good.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.807
Good.

22:10.851 --> 22:13.375
Look, um,
I was talking to Murphy,

22:13.419 --> 22:15.334
and we think it's probably best
to just

22:15.377 --> 22:17.205
pop by the police station,
make sure that they know

22:17.248 --> 22:19.816
the truck isn't
technically ours, you know.

22:19.860 --> 22:22.428
Oh, you were talking
to Murphy. Cool.

22:22.471 --> 22:24.212
Another one of your
private conversations?

22:24.255 --> 22:25.518
It wasn't private.

22:25.561 --> 22:29.478
It was just, like, you
weren't there anymore.

22:29.522 --> 22:31.306
Look, we just want
to make sure

22:31.350 --> 22:32.525
that they don't think
we stole the truck.

22:32.568 --> 22:35.397
Just a precaution.

22:35.441 --> 22:37.747
Okay.Okay.

22:37.791 --> 22:41.838
Oh, uh, can we use your car?

22:51.892 --> 22:53.154
Well, is there a way in?

22:56.549 --> 22:57.854
No.

22:57.898 --> 23:00.379
Cool.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.816
I think we should just go.

23:02.859 --> 23:04.557
Cut our losses.
Felix,

23:04.600 --> 23:07.211
I'm gonna need you to not be
a little bitch for a second.

23:07.255 --> 23:09.083
Whoa, that--Okay? Come on.

23:09.126 --> 23:10.693
There's got to be a way in,
so think of something.

23:10.737 --> 23:12.086
You're smart.

23:12.129 --> 23:14.436
I'm actually not that smart,
I just work very hard.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.698
It's my deepest, darkest secret.

23:15.742 --> 23:17.439
Okay, well, how are
the other cars getting in?

23:17.483 --> 23:19.006
There's, like, a couple
of tow trucks

23:19.049 --> 23:21.312
being checked in
by some guard.

23:21.356 --> 23:24.054
[Murphy sighs heavily]

23:24.098 --> 23:26.535
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

23:31.061 --> 23:34.413
Okay, listen.

23:34.456 --> 23:38.721
On my go, we're gonna get out
of the car inconspicuously

23:38.765 --> 23:40.506
and walk along the fence.

23:40.549 --> 23:42.246
Okay?
We're just gonna
walk on?

23:42.290 --> 23:45.424
We're gonna sneak on.

23:47.469 --> 23:50.254
Wow, I should call you
a little bitch more often.

23:52.256 --> 23:54.302
Ben?

23:56.391 --> 23:57.479
Ben!

23:57.523 --> 24:00.177
Hey.JESS: Hi.

24:00.221 --> 24:02.832
Wha... What's... what's up?

24:02.876 --> 24:06.053
Can you watch Dixie
just for another sec, please?

24:14.365 --> 24:17.499
[sighs sharply]

24:17.543 --> 24:18.935
What am I even looking for?

24:20.981 --> 24:24.201
Stop sending me
to voice mail.

24:24.245 --> 24:26.377
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

24:26.421 --> 24:27.988
JESS: Listen, I need you
to call me back,

24:28.031 --> 24:29.293
'cause I know there's something going on between you guys,

24:29.337 --> 24:31.034
cand I don't know what it is,
but it--

24:31.078 --> 24:34.342
well, it sucks. So please,
please call me back.

24:36.692 --> 24:38.520
Come here. Come here.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.000
What? Wait.

24:40.043 --> 24:42.393
There's a van there. Get in,
get in. Come here, Pretz.

24:42.437 --> 24:44.570
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!Okay, okay.

24:49.575 --> 24:51.751
FELIX [excited whisper]:
We did it. We did it!

24:51.794 --> 24:54.188
We are so far
from being done.

24:54.231 --> 24:56.756
I know, but I feel good, I feel
like we can actually do this.

24:56.799 --> 24:59.454
Wait, something's wet.Ew.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.543
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

25:01.587 --> 25:04.328
Oh, my God!
What?

25:04.372 --> 25:07.288
I think someone was
murdered in here.

25:07.331 --> 25:08.332
What?

25:08.376 --> 25:11.422
There's, like...
blood everywhere,

25:11.466 --> 25:13.381
and bullet holes and...

25:13.424 --> 25:15.905
p... pieces of hair and scalp!

25:15.949 --> 25:16.950
What?Hair.

25:18.995 --> 25:20.693
[retching loudly]

25:20.736 --> 25:23.347
No. No, no, no.

25:23.391 --> 25:25.262
[continues retching]

25:26.394 --> 25:28.614
[Felix panting]

25:32.443 --> 25:33.401
I vomited.

25:33.444 --> 25:36.622
Yeah. I heard.

25:36.665 --> 25:39.712
It's okay, I made it all
into the backpack.

25:39.755 --> 25:43.585
Felix, we were supposed
to put the drugs in there.

25:43.629 --> 25:46.501
Oh, I'm sorry I puked, Murphy.

25:46.545 --> 25:49.112
Is there anything
not wrong with you?[Felix chuckles]

25:49.156 --> 25:52.594
You literally don't even know
how to stop being mean to me,

25:52.638 --> 25:53.856
even in thissituation.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.815
It's-it's-it's, you know,
it's unbelievable.

25:55.858 --> 25:57.251
Seriously?
Yeah.

25:57.294 --> 25:58.948
You really want to have
this conversation right now?

25:58.992 --> 26:00.863
Yeah, I really want to know.
Come on.

26:00.907 --> 26:02.822
What is it about me
that you've always hated?

26:02.865 --> 26:04.432
Oh, I just think it's funny that

26:04.475 --> 26:06.477
you think I'm the one
who started all of this.

26:06.521 --> 26:08.044
[laughs]
I'm sorry.

26:08.088 --> 26:09.872
I'm sorry, what?You really want to know?

26:09.916 --> 26:11.352
Yes, I really want to know.

26:11.395 --> 26:12.483
You really want to know?I reallywant to know.

26:12.527 --> 26:16.444
Fine! Fine, Felix.

26:16.487 --> 26:18.881
You were a dick to me
from the moment you started

26:18.925 --> 26:20.535
working at Guiding Hope.
You know that?

26:20.579 --> 26:22.929
[laughs]You literally tried to get

26:22.972 --> 26:25.932
my own parents to fire me.

26:25.975 --> 26:28.021
You're judgmental,
you're condescending,

26:28.064 --> 26:31.067
and you think you're better
than everyone else.

26:31.111 --> 26:34.941
So, yeah, I haven't been
the biggest fan of yours.

26:34.984 --> 26:38.031
[tow truck engine revs]

26:38.074 --> 26:39.119
Shh.

26:49.999 --> 26:52.480
Ben.

26:52.523 --> 26:53.524
Where's Dixie?

26:58.268 --> 26:59.922
Oh, my God.

26:59.966 --> 27:01.663
[tow truck stops]

27:04.231 --> 27:07.016
WOMAN:
Come to the office, I've got
some paperwork for you.

27:07.060 --> 27:08.714
DRIVER:
Right behind you.[door shuts]

27:08.757 --> 27:10.106
Okay,,,

27:10.150 --> 27:12.326
Now. Now, now, now.

27:12.369 --> 27:13.370
Get out?Go, go, go.

27:23.337 --> 27:26.775
All right, follow me.
Come on.

27:31.258 --> 27:33.564
Go.I'm trying.

27:38.091 --> 27:41.050
Yes! Get down. Okay.

27:41.094 --> 27:43.357
Okay...

27:43.400 --> 27:44.445
Get down.
Get down, Pretzel.

27:44.488 --> 27:46.012
Get down. Shh.

27:46.055 --> 27:48.014
Uh, where do we put it?
Where do we put it?

27:48.057 --> 27:49.624
Can you fit it
in your pants?

27:49.668 --> 27:51.974
No, I wore skinny jeans today.You're wearing skinny jeans?

27:52.018 --> 27:55.064
And we're specifically looking
for a cell phone or computer,

27:55.108 --> 27:56.936
but log anything that can
link back to Nia.

27:56.979 --> 27:58.807
Okay.

28:03.377 --> 28:04.987
Murphy?

28:14.083 --> 28:19.132
We've been shouting
for, like, an hour in here,

28:19.175 --> 28:21.134
and nobody heard us.

28:21.177 --> 28:22.875
You-you think you can just
tow people away?

28:22.918 --> 28:24.137
You want us to believe
that you've been in there

28:24.180 --> 28:25.660
since it was towed
from Guiding Hope?

28:25.704 --> 28:27.401
Yes.

28:27.444 --> 28:29.403
Your idiot tow driver
didn't even think

28:29.446 --> 28:30.926
to check the back, like,
I don't know,

28:30.970 --> 28:33.320
maybe there were
living beings inside.

28:33.363 --> 28:34.756
You weren't stuck.

28:34.800 --> 28:35.975
You could have just
easily walked out.

28:36.018 --> 28:38.629
We-we didn't want
to break the law, sir.

28:38.673 --> 28:40.675
What were you doing
in the van?

28:40.719 --> 28:42.677
Working.We were working.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.767
Moving in shampoos,
conditioners, et cetera.

28:45.811 --> 28:47.726
I mean, as you can see,
we've converted

28:47.769 --> 28:49.989
ye olde truck into...What's in the backpack?

28:50.032 --> 28:52.078
Sorry?

28:52.121 --> 28:54.036
The-the backpack.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.299
That's where I know
you guys from.
What?

28:56.343 --> 28:59.433
The-the litter kids.
They-they brought me litter.

29:00.869 --> 29:02.349
Did Max send you here?

29:02.392 --> 29:03.872
FELIX: What?Give me the backpack, Felix.

29:03.916 --> 29:06.614
I'm not sure...

29:06.657 --> 29:07.789
Give me the backpack, Felix.

29:14.013 --> 29:15.928
Oh, God!

29:15.971 --> 29:17.930
Yeah, I'm so--

29:17.973 --> 29:19.627
Sorry. Bumpy ride.All right, get out of the van.

29:19.670 --> 29:21.542
It's been seized as evidence.
Let's go.

29:21.585 --> 29:22.630
Let's go!

29:22.673 --> 29:25.546
There's a step
in front of you.

29:25.589 --> 29:27.853
Another step. Okay.

29:27.896 --> 29:28.854
Don't touch me. I got it.Pat 'em down.

29:28.897 --> 29:30.551
I'll take her.

29:30.594 --> 29:32.205
[sighs]

29:39.038 --> 29:41.388
Can we go now?

29:41.431 --> 29:43.433
No. I'm taking you in.

29:43.477 --> 29:45.958
Uh, one sec.

29:50.614 --> 29:51.833
We can't bring them in.

29:51.877 --> 29:53.922
Why not?And charge 'em for what?

29:53.966 --> 29:55.358
Being in the van?

29:55.402 --> 29:59.014
After that raid last night,
dude, we can't.

30:01.016 --> 30:02.713
Dixie!

30:03.889 --> 30:06.108
Dixie!

30:06.152 --> 30:08.719
[panting]

30:08.763 --> 30:10.678
Dixie!STERLING:
I see things

30:10.721 --> 30:12.811
over here are going super well.

30:13.855 --> 30:17.119
Yeah, um, Ben lost the dog.

30:17.163 --> 30:19.513
Well, I-I... I lost the dog.

30:19.556 --> 30:20.731
I lost the dog. Uh...

30:20.775 --> 30:22.603
And I-I've been looking
everywhere for her

30:22.646 --> 30:24.126
and I don't know where she is
and I-- Frank's gonna kill me.

30:24.170 --> 30:26.389
I mean, he should kill me
because I-I lost his dog, so...

30:26.433 --> 30:27.913
Jess.

30:27.956 --> 30:30.306
We'll find her. These are, like,

30:30.350 --> 30:32.874
the most well-trained dogs
in the universe.

30:32.918 --> 30:35.137
She didn't go far.

30:48.107 --> 30:50.500
Oh, my God.
[laughs]

30:50.544 --> 30:52.328
Oh, my God.

30:52.372 --> 30:54.026
Oh, my God!

30:54.069 --> 30:56.115
[laughs]:
Oh, my God.
Wow.

30:57.159 --> 30:59.466
We did that.

30:59.509 --> 31:00.946
Youdid that.

31:00.989 --> 31:02.164
That was awesome.

31:02.208 --> 31:03.513
You did it.

31:03.557 --> 31:05.559
You did it, Pretzel.

31:05.602 --> 31:07.387
That's a good boy.

31:07.430 --> 31:09.389
So proud of you.

31:11.434 --> 31:12.783
Huh?

31:12.827 --> 31:13.959
Okay, yeah, no.

31:14.002 --> 31:17.049
Let's not bring
the heroin out, please.

31:20.182 --> 31:21.923
Crazy.

31:21.967 --> 31:23.055
Look, um,

31:23.098 --> 31:25.318
about what you
were saying...

31:25.361 --> 31:26.754
What?

31:26.797 --> 31:29.975
In the murder van? About me?

31:30.018 --> 31:31.977
You're right--
I, um,

31:32.020 --> 31:36.503
I try so hard to be
the opposite of my mother

31:36.546 --> 31:40.072
and then I become
exactly like my mother.

31:40.115 --> 31:42.944
No.
And I'm... sorry.

31:42.988 --> 31:44.772
Felix, you're not like your mom.

31:44.815 --> 31:45.991
I am, I am.
No, you're not.

31:46.034 --> 31:47.209
She-- I mean,
I don't know her.

31:47.253 --> 31:49.603
But she seems
awful and...

31:49.646 --> 31:50.821
[sighs]

31:50.865 --> 31:52.040
...you're not.

31:52.084 --> 31:54.956
I think we just
misjudged each other.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.740
And, I mean...

31:56.784 --> 31:59.308
now that I know you,
I realize you're not...

31:59.352 --> 32:01.658
[chuckles]
...you're not mean at all.

32:01.702 --> 32:03.095
You're just incredibly insecure.

32:03.138 --> 32:04.400
Yeah, I am.

32:04.444 --> 32:05.445
Thank you.

32:05.488 --> 32:08.100
You're an insecure little bitch.

32:08.143 --> 32:10.363
[laughs]

32:10.406 --> 32:11.625
Yeah.

32:14.802 --> 32:15.846
