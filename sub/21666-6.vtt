VINCENT: Hey, Rochelle.

00:24.692 --> 00:25.681
All right.

00:27.403 --> 00:28.984
Fucking smokes.

00:29.488 --> 00:30.694
Hard at work.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.447
How about I speak
for both of us, okay?

00:35.661 --> 00:37.652
Nobody got fucking on the brain.

00:38.122 --> 00:40.864
-Shit.
-Vincent, what's the word?

00:41.542 --> 00:43.373
Girls look like
they're freezing out there.

00:43.461 --> 00:45.543
Neither snow nor rain nor heat

00:45.630 --> 00:47.996
nor gloom of night
stays them courtesans.

00:48.090 --> 00:50.672
Yo, Vince, who the cop?

00:50.843 --> 00:52.549
My brother-in-Iaw, Bobby.

00:52.637 --> 00:53.877
For real?

00:53.971 --> 00:55.222
I smell bacon.

00:55.306 --> 00:57.046
Enough with the cop shit.

00:57.475 --> 01:00.182
All right, look, guys,
I need some girls.

01:00.269 --> 01:01.805
All right? Three if you can swing it.

01:02.438 --> 01:04.349
Starting tonight.
Three more by tomorrow.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.268
What, you some kind of Superman?

01:06.359 --> 01:07.348
VINCENT: Nah, come on.

01:07.443 --> 01:10.025
Look, I got the place
all set up, ready to go.

01:10.112 --> 01:11.613
I need day and night shifts.

01:11.697 --> 01:13.562
Vincent, what the fuck
you talking about?

01:14.242 --> 01:16.107
-The parlor.
-The parlor?

01:16.369 --> 01:18.325
I mean, Frankie talked to you, right?

01:18.412 --> 01:20.198
He said something about something.

01:20.373 --> 01:21.704
Thought the joker was joking.

01:21.791 --> 01:23.076
No, it's real.

01:23.167 --> 01:24.452
Hand my girls to you?

01:26.837 --> 01:28.338
You're not a pimp, barman.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.215
Stick to the stick,
you'll live longer.

01:30.299 --> 01:32.039
-MAN: Preach!
-Look at them standing out there.

01:32.343 --> 01:35.005
I'm offering you
no more standing out in the cold

01:35.096 --> 01:36.461
and snow, coughing and sneezing.

01:36.555 --> 01:38.261
Yeah, how about you, Lurch?
You get cold?

01:39.100 --> 01:41.307
Or you one of them undead
motherfuckers that don't feel it?

01:42.103 --> 01:43.092
Say one more thing.

01:43.187 --> 01:45.098
Look, all right. All right, look.

01:45.189 --> 01:48.056
How about no more
getting ripped off by scumbags?

01:48.150 --> 01:50.562
Some john steps out of line,
he catches a beating.

01:50.653 --> 01:52.143
We handle everything.

01:52.238 --> 01:55.355
Best of all, no more busts.

01:58.995 --> 02:00.986
No, I'm hardly gonna be there.

02:01.080 --> 02:04.072
Yeah? So, who's gonna
be looking after the candy store?

02:05.126 --> 02:07.162
-I am.
-(LAUGH|NG) Shit.

02:07.253 --> 02:09.460
-Oh, man.
-LARRY: For real?

02:09.547 --> 02:10.787
Now I'm curious.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.126
What you gonna give us for our women?

02:13.217 --> 02:14.206
Give you?

02:14.302 --> 02:15.963
No, you're gonna pay me.

02:21.017 --> 02:22.553
All right, let me explain.

02:22.643 --> 02:23.883
Man, get the fuck outta here.

02:25.604 --> 02:26.810
Now.

02:29.442 --> 02:31.979
It's 414 W. 42, just down the street.

02:32.445 --> 02:33.560
Just come check it out.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.145
VINCENT: That's all.
LARRY: Motherfucker.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.697
-That's bullshit.
-MAN: Walk the walk, ladies.

02:39.327 --> 02:40.692
That went well.

02:41.287 --> 02:43.073
Patience, brother, patience.

02:45.249 --> 02:47.865
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

04:17.967 --> 04:20.253
HARVEY:
We're shooting in five, all right?

04:20.511 --> 04:21.500
You look good.

04:22.346 --> 04:24.007
-Thanks. Yeah.
-Feel good? Yeah?

04:24.098 --> 04:25.508
So, what's the plan for this one?

04:25.599 --> 04:26.975
The plan is...

04:27.685 --> 04:30.472
You bang the shit out of each other,
and then everybody comes.

04:30.563 --> 04:33.600
-Jeez, Harvey.
-Wing it with the dialogue.

04:33.691 --> 04:35.647
Nothing avant-garde, please.

04:35.734 --> 04:40.023
And, you know, just keep talking dirty
about how much you want his dick.

04:40.531 --> 04:42.817
Harvey, hey, let me ask you something.

04:43.284 --> 04:46.651
So, you make your prints,
you'll get paid by, what,

04:46.745 --> 04:48.610
number of sales,
percentage of profits?

04:48.706 --> 04:52.369
Are you actually telling me
we don't get any of that?

04:52.460 --> 04:54.746
Yeah, well, it's complicated.

04:54.837 --> 04:55.917
Try me.

04:58.424 --> 04:59.755
What do you want, Candy?

04:59.842 --> 05:01.423
You want fucking royalties?

05:01.510 --> 05:02.841
You want residuals? What?

05:03.512 --> 05:05.298
WOMAN: Here you go.

05:08.392 --> 05:10.303
All right, I'll tell you what,
I'll throw you another $50.

05:10.394 --> 05:13.261
All right? That's a pretty fair bump.

05:16.192 --> 05:17.523
Anyway, you're welcome.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.563
-Thank you.
-MAN: Yeah, hold on.

05:21.780 --> 05:22.986
At least you're in the movies now.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.485
You're not selling ass
out there in the trenches.

05:26.452 --> 05:28.283
You're an entertainer, Miss Merrell.

05:29.455 --> 05:32.071
HARVEY: All right. Adriana, you ready?

05:33.125 --> 05:34.786
All right, don't look so enthused.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.503
Before we get to the readouts

05:36.587 --> 05:39.579
and the random bullshit
that are piled before me,

05:39.673 --> 05:41.379
l have some actual news.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.587
As we are approaching
the end of the year,

05:44.678 --> 05:48.421
it is time for our
semiannual housecleaning,

05:48.516 --> 05:51.508
where we restore the 14th Precinct
to a previous glory

05:51.602 --> 05:53.558
the likes of which
none of us have ever actually known.

05:53.812 --> 05:54.892
Street sweeps.

05:54.980 --> 05:57.892
This year, however,
the bosses in their wisdom

05:57.983 --> 05:59.894
have asked that we pay
particular attention

05:59.985 --> 06:01.441
to the high-heeled army

06:01.570 --> 06:03.731
that marches along
8th and 9th Avenues,

06:03.822 --> 06:06.564
as well as their managerial component.

06:06.659 --> 06:08.240
Fuck the fuckin' whores already.

06:08.953 --> 06:12.241
No,no,no,no.
No, Patrolman Flanagan.

06:12.331 --> 06:15.698
The whores of Times Square
will be decidedly unfucked

06:15.793 --> 06:17.624
from now until the holidays.

06:17.711 --> 06:21.454
So much so that your commanders
do not want to see a single pross

06:21.549 --> 06:24.507
standing on any street corner
in the precinct.

06:24.593 --> 06:25.673
Everybody goes in the wagon.

06:25.761 --> 06:28.047
Every corner, every tour.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.629
And the pimps,
throw any charge you can at them.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.385
You don't have charges,

06:32.476 --> 06:34.012
you can write up
their over-chromed wonders

06:34.103 --> 06:35.092
and tow them off.

06:35.187 --> 06:36.688
We're gonna spend the next two weeks

06:36.772 --> 06:39.263
making the 14th
uninhabitable to the pussy trade.

06:39.608 --> 06:40.893
Two weeks?

06:40.985 --> 06:42.691
Hey, these are the orders
from on high.

06:42.778 --> 06:44.188
I'm making a career out of this.

06:44.280 --> 06:49.274
As of today and until New Year's,
actual paid overtime will flow

06:49.368 --> 06:51.984
for court time
on all prostitution arrests.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.286
-(ALL CHEERING)
-Hell, yes! Why didn't you say so?

06:54.790 --> 06:55.870
Okay?

06:56.083 --> 06:58.119
Behold, gentlemen, your holiday bonus.

06:58.210 --> 07:01.122
All right, let's get to the felonies.

07:04.717 --> 07:06.673
Hey, I'm Candy.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.012
-Peter. How you doing, Candy?
-Good. You?

07:09.096 --> 07:10.506
HARVEY: All right,
what are we waiting for?

07:10.598 --> 07:12.008
Let's turn the lights back on.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.636
WOMAN: I went down on a guy once
after eating a really spicy...

07:14.727 --> 07:18.345
(MOANING LOUDLY)

07:20.399 --> 07:22.560
Miss McGillicutty,
you taste like pussy.

07:23.444 --> 07:24.854
(CHUCKLING) I do?

07:25.529 --> 07:27.986
CANDY: Like delicious pussy?

07:28.824 --> 07:31.361
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

07:32.119 --> 07:34.610
Fuck, I can see I'm gonna
be looping dialogue later.

07:35.039 --> 07:36.370
-HARVEY: Ugh.
-(CAN DY MOANING)

07:36.874 --> 07:38.535
Yeah, enough. Enough of that.

07:38.626 --> 07:40.366
Um... Yeah, just start fucking.

07:43.756 --> 07:46.589
HARVEY: No, get the... Yeah, yeah.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.254
More thrust. I want to see shaft.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.299
CAMERAMAN: Frame up.
HARVEY: You got a good frame?

07:53.390 --> 07:54.721
CAMERAMAN: Yeah. Yeah, Harvey.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.060
Okay, Candy,
I'm gonna ask you to come now.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.133
CANDY: NOW?

07:58.854 --> 08:00.685
-For Christ's sake, we're framed up.
-CANDY: Okay.

08:00.773 --> 08:03.059
HARVEY: The makeup still looks right,
okay? We're gonna get this now.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.357
(MOANING) Oh! Oh, I'm coming!

08:05.444 --> 08:07.435
Oh, don't stop! Don't!

08:07.571 --> 08:09.107
Oh! Oh!

08:09.198 --> 08:10.904
Oh, God!

08:10.991 --> 08:12.151
Oh...

08:15.996 --> 08:16.985
Great.

08:17.748 --> 08:21.115
Okay, let's get back between her legs.

08:21.502 --> 08:23.413
(BOTH MOANING)

08:23.712 --> 08:25.248
Fuck. (MOANING)

08:26.757 --> 08:28.213
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

08:28.801 --> 08:31.258
-Honey. You didn't.
-HARVEY: Cut.

08:31.345 --> 08:32.460
Are you fucking kidding me?

08:32.554 --> 08:33.964
I'm sorry, Harvey, I got carried away.

08:34.306 --> 08:36.467
PETER: Don't worry, I'm good for it.

08:36.558 --> 08:39.140
CANDY: (WHISPERING)
It's okay. Oh, honey.

08:40.813 --> 08:43.020
-Josie, poppers.
-JOS|E: On it.

08:43.482 --> 08:44.517
They give me migraines.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.515
You want, I can puff that up for you.

08:46.610 --> 08:47.816
CAMERAMAN: No, don't you move.

08:47.903 --> 08:49.359
I'll have to reset if you do.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.486
HARVEY: Hey. (SNAPS FINGERS)

08:51.782 --> 08:53.397
You can't pay me enough.

08:58.414 --> 08:59.449
PETER: Give me five minutes.

09:00.082 --> 09:02.664
I'll give you three minutes,
all right? Hurry up.

09:02.751 --> 09:05.128
HARVEY: Mankiewicz never had
to wait around for a hard-on.

09:07.423 --> 09:08.583
Five minutes.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.210
Jocelyn, can you hand me a towel?

09:11.301 --> 09:14.213
-Yeah, sure. There you go.
-Thanks.

09:21.103 --> 09:22.934
Sooze, how you doing, beautiful?

09:23.021 --> 09:25.307
I'm good, Mr. Pipilo. Drink?

09:25.399 --> 09:27.014
Maybe a little later, thanks.

09:27.109 --> 09:28.770
MAN: Shuffle me up another run, Mike.

09:29.945 --> 09:31.355
All right, man.

09:32.698 --> 09:34.814
-Just who I needed to see.
-RUDY: Really?

09:34.908 --> 09:36.364
And I came here looking for you.

09:36.452 --> 09:38.568
Oh, well, you go first.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.320
I need a couple of your guys
for this evening.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.280
-Gotta run around on something.
-My guys?

09:43.375 --> 09:46.663
Faces that won't be recognized.
Our people are all too familiar.

09:46.754 --> 09:47.994
MAN: No, man, aces low.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.465
All right, how about
Mike and Black Frankie?

09:50.549 --> 09:51.914
Whoa, whoa.

09:52.009 --> 09:53.249
What about White Frankie?

09:56.263 --> 09:59.755
I got this, Mr. P.
Whatever you need, I got.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.728
VINCENT: All right, you're hired.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.810
Big Mike and White Frankie.

10:09.902 --> 10:11.017
Why are you looking for us?

10:11.487 --> 10:14.194
Vince, I gotta get
some real gin from the back, okay?

10:14.448 --> 10:15.483
All right.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.488
I like that.

10:20.579 --> 10:23.616
Listen, Rudy, Bobby and me,
we tried to pull up some of the pimps

10:23.707 --> 10:25.208
to get girls for the place, you know?

10:25.292 --> 10:26.998
Let me guess, no sale, right?

10:27.085 --> 10:29.872
All right, we'll help you
stock the pond to start.

10:29.963 --> 10:30.998
Try Sal's cousin.

10:31.089 --> 10:33.580
You know, the greasy little fuck
out by the airport.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.006
-Yeah.
-You should go with him.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.674
Learn something about closing a deal.

10:37.387 --> 10:40.049
Okay, let's have a couple drinks,

10:40.140 --> 10:42.677
and then we're gonna go out
and have an adventure.

10:45.395 --> 10:49.764
Explain to me exactly why
there's now film in the camera.

10:50.692 --> 10:52.557
-Change in the weather.
-Meaning what?

10:52.653 --> 10:53.938
The obscenity laws.

10:54.488 --> 10:55.978
They pass new ones?

10:56.782 --> 10:59.068
No. No, not really.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.447
It's just these judges downtown,
they're tossing everything now.

11:02.538 --> 11:04.369
Every last fucking case
is getting tossed.

11:04.456 --> 11:05.445
VVhy?

11:06.208 --> 11:08.119
lt's... I don't know.

11:08.669 --> 11:11.376
You know, it's been,
like, a loop here,

11:11.630 --> 11:14.167
a skin mag there, you show a little,

11:14.258 --> 11:16.590
you see if they lock you up,
see if they convict.

11:16.677 --> 11:19.669
If they don't, you show a little more.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.845
It's been going on
like that for years now,

11:21.932 --> 11:23.888
one pubic hair at a time.

11:24.393 --> 11:25.473
What changed?

11:27.229 --> 11:28.969
I don't know exactly.

11:29.064 --> 11:31.305
These last couple cases,

11:31.400 --> 11:35.894
the judges aren't trying to decide
whether or not something is too dirty,

11:35.988 --> 11:38.821
only whether it has any, you know,
what do you call it?

11:38.907 --> 11:39.896
Uh...

11:40.117 --> 11:42.403
"Socially redeeming value."

11:42.494 --> 11:43.779
And does it?

11:45.163 --> 11:46.289
Not that I can tell.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.579
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

11:49.793 --> 11:50.999
Okay.

25:47.755 --> 25:49.791
He's got machines
in the stores that are mine.

25:50.383 --> 25:51.463
A piece of that accrues to me.

25:51.926 --> 25:53.257
He's getting his take.

25:53.845 --> 25:55.460
Yeah, a percentage of whatever.

25:55.555 --> 25:57.170
What? You're saying I'm stealing now?

25:57.265 --> 25:59.881
-Are you?
-No.

26:00.351 --> 26:02.592
Listen, right now
we're looking at the raw take

26:02.687 --> 26:04.848
so all of us know what
an honest day brings in.

26:04.939 --> 26:07.521
This way, none of us can say
we were misled, right?

26:07.608 --> 26:10.645
Did you run this little move
of yours by your guy?

26:10.737 --> 26:13.479
-I mean, does he know?
-What do you think?

26:13.573 --> 26:15.313
I think you got a couple stores.

26:15.408 --> 26:17.399
I own a couple of dozen.

26:17.493 --> 26:20.360
I also have the product.
I own the labs.

26:20.455 --> 26:24.789
The majority of the film operation,
that's Genovese.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.833
And that's me, not you.

26:28.004 --> 26:29.494
You got a problem
with what I'm doing, Matty,

26:29.589 --> 26:30.704
take it up with my boss.

26:30.798 --> 26:33.210
You tell him that no one has
any reason to doubt the count.

26:33.301 --> 26:35.007
I should go fuck myself.

26:35.261 --> 26:36.762
See how that plays at the club.

26:39.015 --> 26:40.551
-So?
-MARTY: Fucking...

26:40.641 --> 26:42.506
Good news today, yeah?

26:42.602 --> 26:44.308
I think so, Rudy.

26:44.395 --> 26:46.181
Always ready for good news.

26:46.981 --> 26:49.142
JUDGE: Precedent no longer guides us.

26:49.233 --> 26:50.484
For good reason, too.

26:50.818 --> 26:53.981
This term "pornography"
defies definition.

26:54.238 --> 26:56.399
Even those judges who agree
that a particular film

26:56.491 --> 27:00.154
is not legally pornographic
cannot, among themselves, know why.

27:00.244 --> 27:01.905
And the result is a hodgepodge.

27:01.996 --> 27:05.033
And we of the lower courts
are constrained to anticipate

27:05.124 --> 27:08.708
final action of the majority
of the higher court.

27:08.795 --> 27:10.251
So we flounder in wondering

27:10.338 --> 27:12.044
what the Supreme Court
will do in each matter.

27:12.131 --> 27:15.373
-Who's at bat there?
-What, them guys?

27:15.468 --> 27:16.833
They're the ones who got busted

27:16.928 --> 27:19.965
when they kicked the door in
on Matty's film lab.

27:20.056 --> 27:21.671
The one out in Queens?

27:21.766 --> 27:23.051
They're the ones who got caught

27:23.142 --> 27:25.383
with all that film footage
last year, remember?

27:26.562 --> 27:30.100
JUDGE: Attuning the law to the times
is the primary function of the courts.

27:30.191 --> 27:32.352
May we never forget that.

27:32.443 --> 27:37.437
Now, what I think of these films
as an individual is immaterial.

27:39.033 --> 27:41.319
As a judge, I cannot stultify myself

27:41.410 --> 27:44.447
to satisfy my personal feelings
and inclinations.

27:44.914 --> 27:46.870
And the evidence here is indisputable

27:46.958 --> 27:49.791
and bind me to granting
the defendant's motion

27:49.877 --> 27:51.742
and dismissing the indictment.

27:51.838 --> 27:56.628
These personal freedoms are protected
by the 1st and the 14th Amendments.

27:56.717 --> 28:00.460
The defendants are discharged
and this case is closed.

-Yeah. Yeah.

28:14.151 --> 28:16.016

28:16.112 --> 28:19.195
It's been like this with damn near
every obscenity case on the docket.

28:19.532 --> 28:21.193
In this town,
nothing's dirty any more.

28:24.620 --> 28:28.408
And the movie thing lwas
telling you about?

28:30.167 --> 28:31.623
The backers backed out of that one.

28:31.711 --> 28:33.576
It was a long shot, anyway, but...

28:34.505 --> 28:36.041
I'm thinking of it
as a bump in the road.

28:36.132 --> 28:37.247

to get a place for us

28:54.859 --> 28:56.019

28:56.110 --> 28:57.896

28:57.987 --> 28:59.352

in any of this.

51:59.325 --> 52:01.566
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

52:03.288 --> 52:04.778
I'm not your source.

52:05.999 --> 52:07.079
If you say so.

52:07.166 --> 52:08.497
I say so.

52:11.629 --> 52:13.335
I've got a hell of a story for you.

52:15.258 --> 52:17.294
(JAZZ MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)

52:24.892 --> 52:26.098
MAN: Eddie!

52:26.311 --> 52:28.267
Shit, he's an asshole.

52:43.953 --> 52:45.238
Hey.

52:50.543 --> 52:52.374
You sure you want to do this?

53:16.235 --> 53:18.647
RUDY: Your brother and the big moolie?

53:18.738 --> 53:21.855
They did good, Vincent.
Real fucking good for me.

53:22.325 --> 53:24.156
You let them know
when they come in the bar tomorrow

53:24.243 --> 53:26.825
there's gonna be something there
in the register for them both.

53:30.500 --> 53:33.788
Truth is, I think the big moolie
is the brains of this operation.

53:34.212 --> 53:36.043
-No offense.
-No.

53:36.464 --> 53:39.001
Look, Rudy, I gotta
ask you a question.

53:40.927 --> 53:42.212
I'm not in a crew.

53:42.678 --> 53:43.804
I'm not connected to anybody.

53:43.888 --> 53:45.344
Where are your people from?

53:46.099 --> 53:48.886
Italy. The boot.

53:48.976 --> 53:50.967
I don't know, I'm from Bay Ridge.
What the fuck do I know?

53:51.938 --> 53:55.180
Look, my question is why me?

53:55.942 --> 53:58.524
I mean, why did I get tapped
by Rudy Pipilo

53:58.945 --> 54:00.185
to handle all this here?

54:01.656 --> 54:03.647
What did we just learn
about the loop money?

54:04.075 --> 54:05.611
What do we know, Vincent?

54:06.077 --> 54:07.908
l'm swimming in a shark tank.

54:07.995 --> 54:11.658
Marty Hodas, his muscle,
the bookstore guys,

54:11.749 --> 54:13.205
even Matty the Horse.

54:13.292 --> 54:15.908
He's Genovese, and they're
supposed to have honor, right?

54:17.213 --> 54:18.623
I bet you dollars to donuts

54:18.714 --> 54:21.000
that Matty is skimming
with Hodas, too.

54:21.926 --> 54:24.588
These are my allies, supposedly.

54:25.012 --> 54:27.298
And all of them are
a bunch of fucking thieves.

54:28.850 --> 54:30.010
Except you.

54:32.437 --> 54:33.597
How do you know?

54:35.273 --> 54:37.639
'Cause you've proven it
time and time again.

54:37.900 --> 54:39.106
"Why me?"

54:39.735 --> 54:42.226
And I keep trying
to tell you, ltrust you.

54:42.321 --> 54:44.573
Compared with everyone else
I'm dealing with,

54:44.657 --> 54:46.648
you're a goddamn parish priest.

54:47.577 --> 54:49.158
And that means something to me.

54:52.999 --> 54:54.535
Tell your goofy brother what I said.

55:14.437 --> 55:15.927
MAN: Are we good?
WOMAN: Yes, that's lovely.

55:16.022 --> 55:17.603
-Thank you, darling.
-MAN: Okay.

55:17.690 --> 55:19.100
WOMAN: Just sit down.

55:19.650 --> 55:22.141
Oh, I see.
Okay, you're ready, aren't you?

55:23.905 --> 55:25.611
All right, yes.

55:25.698 --> 55:26.813
Yeah.

55:26.908 --> 55:29.069
(MOANING) Ooh. Oh!

55:32.121 --> 55:33.156
MAN: Yeah.
