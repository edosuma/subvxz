WEBVTT

00:08.209 --> 00:10.111
Marnie:
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE TWO HOURS LATE.

00:10.211 --> 00:12.180
IT'S A GIGANTIC
FUCKING WAREHOUSE PARTY.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.182
IT'S NOT EXACTLY
A PROMPT SITUATION.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.849
WHY ARE WE EVEN GOING?

00:15.949 --> 00:18.018
BECAUSE, MARNIE,
JADED AS I AM,

00:18.119 --> 00:22.323
I STILL HOLD OUT HOPE
THAT THE NEXT PARTY WILL BE
THE BEST PARTY EVER.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.525
OKAY, BEST PARTY EVER--
TO ME THAT'S LIKE SAYING

00:24.625 --> 00:27.361
- BEST GYM EVER OR BEST
NATURE DOCUMENTARY EVER.
- ( phone chimes )

00:27.461 --> 00:30.398
LIKE, HOW GOOD
CAN IT REALLY BE?

00:30.498 --> 00:32.165
THIS IS ODD.

00:32.266 --> 00:35.136
JUST GOT A TEXT MESSAGE.
"WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?"

00:35.236 --> 00:36.870
I DON'T KNOW THIS NUMBER.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.806
ASK WHO IT IS.

00:38.906 --> 00:40.941
NO.
THAT'S NO FUN.

00:41.041 --> 00:44.645
"AT BEST PARTY EVER."

00:44.745 --> 00:46.180
( laughs )

00:46.280 --> 00:49.617
"45 BUSHWICK PLACE.
COME."

00:49.717 --> 00:52.820
Marnie:
I THINK MAYBE
I FOUND IT.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.856
OKAY, LET'S GO.

00:55.956 --> 00:57.925
IT LOOKS
BIG AND SCARY.

00:58.025 --> 00:59.227
( music playing )

00:59.327 --> 01:01.662
THERE ARE A LOT
OF PEOPLE HERE.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.097
OF COURSE THERE ARE,

01:03.197 --> 01:04.897
BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE
PERSON IS COMING.

01:04.998 --> 01:07.168
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY
COMMUNICATE THIS TO YOU GUYS

01:07.268 --> 01:09.270
IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ME YET,
BUT ALL OF BROOKLYN

01:09.370 --> 01:11.905
AND TWO-THIRDS OF MANHATTAN
WILL BE HERE.

01:12.005 --> 01:14.542
OH, MY GOSH, I MEAN,
I JUST HOPE CHARLIE'S
OKAY SEEING ME.

01:14.642 --> 01:17.645
HIS BAND IS PLAYING.
I JUST CANNOT TAKE
A SCENE RIGHT NOW.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.980
YOU WOULD NEVER EVEN FIND HIM.
IT'S LIKE "WATERWORLD" IN THERE.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.982
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.517
WE ARE HERE NOW.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.419
* And watch she gon'
get Donkey Kong *

01:25.519 --> 01:27.588
* Baby, if you're ready
for things to get heavy *

01:27.688 --> 01:29.457
* I get on the floor and act
a fool if you let me, dale *

01:29.557 --> 01:31.692
* Don't believe me,
just bet me *

01:31.792 --> 01:33.694
* My name ain't Keith,
but I see the way
you sweat me *

01:33.794 --> 01:35.329
* LA, Miami, New York

01:35.429 --> 01:37.097
* Say no more,
get on the floor *

01:37.198 --> 01:39.066
* La la la la la

01:39.167 --> 01:42.303
* La la la la la
la la la la... *

01:42.403 --> 01:46.106
JOIN THE MOVEMENT.
TITS OUT FOR CHRISTMAS.

01:47.641 --> 01:50.344
PROMISE ME WE'LL STICK
TOGETHER IN THERE, OKAY?

01:50.444 --> 01:52.480
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
GO FIND MY FIXED-GEAR
BIKE-RIDING FRIENDS?

01:52.580 --> 01:54.482
- I'M A LOSER.
- YOU'RE ACTUALLY NOT.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.717
IT'S SOME WEIRD MYTHOLOGY
YOU HAVE ABOUT YOURSELF,

01:56.817 --> 02:00.120
KIND OF LIKE THE IDEA
THAT YOU NEED TO GET 11
HOURS OF SLEEP EVERY NIGHT.

02:00.221 --> 02:02.856
I DO EVER SINCE I HAD MONO.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.431
OH, MY GOD,
IS THAT SHOSHANNA?

02:10.531 --> 02:12.500
SHOSH!

02:13.834 --> 02:16.804
- SHOSHANNA!
- HI. HI.

02:16.904 --> 02:17.871
GET OVER HERE.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.773
SORRY.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.675
SORRY.
EXCUSE ME.

02:21.775 --> 02:24.178
OH, MY GOD.
THANK GOD.

02:24.278 --> 02:26.079
- OH, MY GOD.
- YOU LOOK REALLY SWEET.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.681
- REALLY? NO.
- YEAH.

02:27.781 --> 02:30.351
I MEAN, THIS IS LIKE
SIX MONTHS OLD,
THIS OUTFIT.

02:30.451 --> 02:32.953
UM, I'VE LITERALLY
BEEN HERE FOR TWO HOURS

02:33.053 --> 02:34.322
AND I HAVEN'T
SPOKEN TO ANYBODY.

02:34.422 --> 02:36.590
I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU,
I COULD MURDER YOU.

02:36.690 --> 02:39.059
OH, MY GOD,
AND YOUR BOYFRIEND'S
BAND IS PLAYING.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.495
NOW I HAVE TO GO
SAY HI.

02:41.595 --> 02:44.532
- NO, YOU DON'T.
- YES, I DO.

02:46.300 --> 02:49.169
( band playing )

03:11.459 --> 03:13.761
- ( music ends )
- ( crowd cheering )

03:13.861 --> 03:15.563
THANK YOU.

03:15.663 --> 03:18.065
WHOEVER BROUGHT
A FUCKING BABY,

03:18.165 --> 03:20.000
YOU DON'T BRING A BABY
TO A PARTY LIKE THIS.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.135
USE YOUR FUCKING HEAD.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.104
WE'RE QUESTIONABLE GOODS,
FULLY DOWNLOADABLE

03:24.204 --> 03:26.374
AT QUESTIONABLEGOODS.TV.
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.909
( crowd cheering )

03:37.251 --> 03:39.453
- OH.
- HEY.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.323
HEY.

03:42.423 --> 03:45.158
MM-MMM.
IT'S NICE TO SEE
YOUR FACE.

03:45.259 --> 03:49.463
YEAH, I THOUGHT
IT MIGHT BE.
NICE SET.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.764
THANK YOU.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.800
IT'S JUST NICE TO SEE
THAT YOU'RE PLAYING.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.235
YOU KNOW, I KNOW YOU
DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE
DOING THAT ENOUGH.

03:55.336 --> 03:58.472
YEAH, RIGHT. NO, ACTUALLY,
WE'VE GOT SOME REALLY
GREAT THINGS LINED UP.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.541
I'M REALLY, REALLY HAPPY
FOR YOU, CHARLIE.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.042
THANKS.

04:02.142 --> 04:04.578
I MEAN, ALL I EVER
WANTED FOR YOU WAS

04:04.678 --> 04:08.549
TO BE ABLE TO FIND
SATISFACTION OUTSIDE
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP.

04:09.149 --> 04:11.218
OH.

04:11.319 --> 04:13.321
UM, IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

04:13.421 --> 04:14.888
YEAH. YEAH.
NO, YOU, TOO.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.524
YOU LOOK GREAT.

04:16.624 --> 04:19.226
THIS FEELS VERY, LIKE,
CORDIAL AND GROWN-UP.

04:19.327 --> 04:21.228
YEAH.
YEAH, RIGHT?

04:21.329 --> 04:23.163
WELL, IT'S--

04:23.263 --> 04:25.265
YOU KNOW, IT'S MATURE.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.934
- YEAH.
- RIGHT?

04:27.034 --> 04:28.436
- AH!
- OOH!

04:28.536 --> 04:30.671
- YOU WERE...
- WHOA, WHOA.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.673
- ...FUCKING AWESOME.
- SHH, SHH.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.608
- THANK YOU.
- YOU WERE AMAZING.

04:34.708 --> 04:38.312
- UM, MARNIE,
THIS IS AUDREY.
- HI.

04:38.412 --> 04:40.213
HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.
HOW GOOD WAS HE?

04:40.314 --> 04:43.317
IT WAS YOUR FIRST GIG
IN, LIKE, FOREVER AND
YOU GUYS ROCKED IT.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.152
- HMM, GIG.
- I'M SO IMPRESSED.

04:45.252 --> 04:48.389
- UM, SORRY, WHAT IS--
WHAT IS GOING ON?
- ( loud music playing )

04:48.489 --> 04:49.623
- WHAT?
- ( crowd cheering )

04:49.723 --> 04:53.093
WHAT-- WHAT IS
GOING ON WITH THIS?

04:53.193 --> 04:55.629
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

04:55.729 --> 04:59.400
- IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS.
- UH, YEAH.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.268
THIS HAPPENED
IN TWO WEEKS?

05:01.369 --> 05:03.371
UH, YEAH.

05:03.471 --> 05:06.039
NO, I GUESS.
WE-- WE JUST MET

05:06.139 --> 05:08.442
AND SORT OF CLICKED.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.178
I'M SORRY,
WHO ARE YOU?

05:11.278 --> 05:13.313
YOU'VE NEVER HEARD
OF ME?

05:13.414 --> 05:15.215
NO, SHOULD I HAVE?

05:15.315 --> 05:17.851
ARE YOU ONE OF THOSE
"REAL HOUSEWIVES"?

05:17.951 --> 05:19.987
OH.

05:20.087 --> 05:22.990
YOU ARE A SOCIOPATH.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.095
( music playing )

05:29.663 --> 05:32.866
- THIS ROOM
IS AMATEUR HOUR.
- TOTALLY.

05:32.966 --> 05:36.003
ALTHOUGH I DO LOVE A MAN
WHO ONLY HANGS OUT WITH DYKES.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.705
LOOK AT THEM.

05:37.805 --> 05:40.340
THEY'RE FAWNING ALL OVER HIM
LIKE HE OWNS A HOME DEPOT.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.242
WHOO-HOO-HOO!

05:42.342 --> 05:44.678
WHOO!
ALL RIGHT!

05:46.079 --> 05:47.448
OKAY, THAT'S ADAM.

05:47.548 --> 05:50.350
HE DOES SORT OF LOOK
LIKE THE ORIGINAL MAN.

05:50.451 --> 05:53.086
NO, LIKE MY ADAM.
LIKE ADAM ADAM.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.791
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.960
I'VE NEVER SEEN
HIM WITH A SHIRT ON.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.362
THE LAST TIME
I TALKED TO HIM,
HE SAID THAT HE MISSED ME

06:02.463 --> 06:03.964
AND HE WOULD PAY ME TO COME
EAT POPCORN WITH HIM,

06:04.064 --> 06:06.834
BUT THEN HE HASN'T
RETURNED A TEXT OF MINE
IN OVER TWO WEEKS.

06:06.934 --> 06:09.737
AND I WAS JUST COMING TO TERMS
WITH THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DEAD.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.539
WHY ARE YOU ALL
STANDING IN A LINE?

06:11.639 --> 06:15.008
BECAUSE THAT IS ADAM
AND I AM NOT GONNA
TALK TO HIM.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.846
WELL, I JUST WATCHED
CHARLIE GET CLIMBED

06:18.946 --> 06:21.449
LIKE A GYM CLASS ROPE
BY A TINY NAVAJO.

06:21.549 --> 06:23.984
AND HE DIDN'T STOP HER
BECAUSE HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND

06:24.084 --> 06:25.686
AND SHE IS HIS GIRLFRIEND.

06:25.786 --> 06:28.656
WHAT THE FUCK
IS SHE DOING?

06:30.524 --> 06:33.627
( shouting )

06:36.029 --> 06:38.499
OH, HANNAH?
HANNAH!

06:38.599 --> 06:40.834
HEY, GUYS,
THAT'S HANNAH.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.903
- Woman: HANNAH?
- Adam: HANNAH!

06:43.003 --> 06:45.372
TELL HER TO COME BACK.

06:45.473 --> 06:48.676
- YOU FUCKING SCARED HER!
- OH, NO! NO, NO!

06:48.776 --> 06:51.579
* Godzilla bankroll,
stones from Sierra Leone *

06:51.679 --> 06:54.047
* Yo, I ain't got it all,
that means I'm barely home *

06:54.147 --> 06:56.917
* Trailblazers stay ballin',
revenge is my arts... *

06:57.017 --> 06:58.385
YOU LOOK INCREDIBLE.

06:58.486 --> 07:00.854
SO DOES EVERYONE
IN THE "AGE OF INNOCENCE"
FAN CLUB

07:00.954 --> 07:02.856
GET ONE OF THESE
OR JUST THE GOLD MEMBERS?

07:02.956 --> 07:05.826
- EVERYONE.
- EVERYONE GETS ONE?

07:05.926 --> 07:08.095
- IT'S LIKE
WEARABLE TAXIDERMY.
- MMM.

07:08.195 --> 07:11.031
LOOKS LIKE IT'S JUST READY
TO LIKE JUST MOUTH-FUCK YOU.

07:11.131 --> 07:14.234
- JUST FUCKING--
- HOW'S YOUR BUG-EYED
GIRLFRIEND?

07:14.334 --> 07:15.603
SHE'S NOT
MY GIRLFRIEND ANYMORE.

07:15.703 --> 07:17.270
- NO?
- MM-MM, DIDN'T WORK.

07:17.370 --> 07:19.106
- WHY?
- EH, A BUNCH OF REASONS.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.509
HER FATHER'S A SHRINK.
SHE LAUGHS AT HER OWN JOKES.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.076
SO SEXUAL--

07:23.176 --> 07:24.878
- HI. HI. HI.
- HI.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.947
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.
I JUST HAD THIS CRAZY
REALIZATION.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.149
IT'S KIND OF AMAZING
AND I'M GONNA SHARE IT
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

07:29.249 --> 07:31.952
OKAY, SO I WAS THINKING--
NO, I FEEL, I BELIEVE

07:32.052 --> 07:34.054
THAT I CAN BE MUCH MORE
AWESOME IN KICKBOXING CLASS.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.857
MAYBE I CAN EVEN
MOVE TOWARDS THE FRONT
AND PEOPLE WOULD FOLLOW ME.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.527
- WHO THE FUCK IS THIS?
- THIS IS MY COUSIN SHOSHANNA.

07:39.627 --> 07:41.595
SHOSHANNA, RAY.
RAY, SHOSHANNA.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.330
- SHE IS MY MATERNAL COUSIN.
- HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

07:43.430 --> 07:46.534
SO, LIKE, WHAT IS IT
ABOUT WOMEN THAT MAKES
CERTAIN PEOPLE

07:46.634 --> 07:50.070
MOVE TOWARDS THE FRONT, LIKE,
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A BRAZILIAN
BLOWOUT OR THEY'RE ENGAGED?

07:50.170 --> 07:52.906
NO, THOSE ARE MATERIAL
CONCERNS THAT MAKE THEM
FEEL THE CONFIDENCE

07:53.006 --> 07:54.542
TO MOVE TOWARDS THE FRONT,
BUT IT'S NOT REAL.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.243
THERE ARE ALWAYS TWO SPACES
AT LEAST NEAR THE FRONT,

07:56.343 --> 07:58.045
AND I WORK HARD
AND I KICK ASS

07:58.145 --> 08:00.113
AND I'M GOING
TOWARDS THE FRONT.
IS IT SO CRAZY HOT IN HERE?

08:00.213 --> 08:03.183
- ARE YOU--
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- MM-HMM, I THINK SO.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.052
I JUST-- I'M REALLY,
REALLY HIGH.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.453
I'M LIKE OUT-OF-MY-MIND HIGH.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.288
I SMOKED SOME POT IN LINE
FOR THE BATHROOM,

08:08.388 --> 08:10.958
WHICH IS SO DIRTY.
DO NOT GO IN THERE
UNLESS IT'S AN EMERGE.

08:11.058 --> 08:13.727
WITH THESE GUYS
IN LINE FOR THE BATHROOM,
THEY GAVE ME SOME POT

08:13.827 --> 08:16.396
OUT OF A PIPE,
BUT IT WAS A STEM.
THEY KEPT CALLING IT A STEM.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.166
- IT WAS A STEM.
- I DON'T THINK SHE'S HIGH
ON MARIJUANA.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.968
- WAS IT A CRACK STEM?
- NO.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.736
- DID YOU SMOKE CRACK?
- NO.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.005
- LITTLE WHITE ROCKS?
- NO!

08:25.105 --> 08:28.976
IT WAS A GLASS CIGARETTE
AND I'M HIGH.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.712
AND MY EARS FEEL LIKE POPPING.
DO YOUR EARS FEEL LIKE POPPING?

08:31.812 --> 08:35.883
OKAY, HEY, LOOK AT ME.
YOU SMOKED CRACK.

08:35.982 --> 08:39.587
YOU SMOKED
JUST SOME CRACK.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.554
OH, MY GOD,
DON'T TELL MY MOM.

08:41.655 --> 08:42.990
DON'T EVEN TELL ME.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.292
I MATRICULATE AT N.Y.U.
AND I JUST SMOKED CRACK.

08:45.392 --> 08:47.661
- WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?
- YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE, OKAY?

08:47.761 --> 08:51.264
CRACK CAN BE REALLY FUN
UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES

08:51.364 --> 08:53.133
AND IT ONLY LASTS
A LITTLE WHILE.

08:53.233 --> 08:56.770
AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.
I WILL BE YOUR CRACK
SPIRIT GUIDE.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.372
OKAY?

08:59.472 --> 09:02.910
SHH, SHH.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.412
OH, MY GOD.

09:05.512 --> 09:07.848
- OH, MY FUCKING GOD.
- WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

09:10.951 --> 09:13.353
CAN YOU WATCH HER
FOR ONE SECOND?

09:13.453 --> 09:15.255
HER? ARE YOU
FUCKING KIDDING ME?
NO WAY.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.825
I'M NOT
A FUCKING JAP DAY CARE.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

09:17.925 --> 09:19.593
PLEASE.
THAT'S MY BOSS
RIGHT THERE.

09:19.693 --> 09:22.329
ALL I'M ASKING IS THAT
YOU JUST MAKE SURE

09:22.429 --> 09:26.233
SHE DOESN'T JUMP OFF
A ROOF OR GET FINGERED
BY A BEAT-BOXER.

09:26.333 --> 09:29.870
OKAY? HEY, SHOSH,
THIS IS RAY.
REMEMBER RAY?

09:29.970 --> 09:31.939
HE'S GONNA BE YOUR
NEW CRACK SPIRIT GUIDE.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.642
OKAY, I WILL BE BACK.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.879
SO HOW LONG--
HEY.

09:38.979 --> 09:41.048
HEY! HEY!

09:41.148 --> 09:44.484
WAIT! OVER THERE--
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
HEY!

IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

09:46.687 --> 09:48.822
LIKE...

09:50.991 --> 09:53.794
WHAT IF-- I HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING IN TWO WEEKS.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.331
I GOT YOUR TEXT.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.400
OH, YOU--
OH, YEAH.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.102
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

10:02.202 --> 10:05.238
THIS IS A KILLER PARTY.
LIKING THE VIBE.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.007
- IS THAT SO?
- YEAH.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.642
- LIKING THE VIBE?
- GOOD VIBE.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.110
OH, SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.212
YOU'RE GONNA GO TO THE FRONT
IN KICKBOXING CLASS.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.147
- IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.
- Ray: SHOSHANNA!

10:14.247 --> 10:15.949
JUST DO NOT GET RAPED
BY THE MAN IN PLAID.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.018
DON'T GET RAPED
BY THE MAN IN PLAID.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.888
I'M YOUR CRACK
SPIRIT GUIDE!

10:20.988 --> 10:22.790
STOP!

10:46.313 --> 10:49.182
OH, THANKS,
BUT NO, THANKS.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.952
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T.
I DON'T DRINK WELL.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.455
YOU'RE HANNAH, RIGHT?

10:55.555 --> 10:57.624
I AM, YEAH.
YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH ADAM?

10:57.725 --> 10:59.592
YEAH. TAKO.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.294
IT'S NICE
TO MEET YOU, TAKO.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.596
YEAH.
IT'S WITH A "K."

11:03.697 --> 11:05.465
OH, OKAY.
SO HOW DO YOU PRONOUNCE IT?

11:05.565 --> 11:07.334
LIKE THAT.
YOU GOT IT.

11:07.434 --> 11:10.337
IT'S JUST I CAN USUALLY
TELL WHEN SOMEONE THINKS
IT'S WITH A "C."

11:10.437 --> 11:12.940
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
NEVER AGAIN.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.607
IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.676
IT'S JUST SOMETHING
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.278
YEAH, OF COURSE.
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.180
SOMETIMES PEOPLE
PRONOUNCE MY NAME "HANA"

11:20.280 --> 11:23.550
LIKE I'M ISRAELI
OR SOMETHING AND IT CAN BE
COMPLETELY DISORIENTING.

11:23.650 --> 11:25.218
YEAH, I KNOW, RIGHT?

11:25.318 --> 11:27.354
HEY, ARE YOU SURE
YOU DON'T WANT A DRINK?

11:27.454 --> 11:28.789
I'M GOOD, YEAH.
I SHOULDN'T.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.590
IT NEVER GOES WELL
FOR ME.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.425
LAST TIME I GOT DRUNK,
I ATE ALL THIS BRIE

11:32.525 --> 11:34.027
AND I THREW UP
ON MY CELL PHONE.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.429
OKAY, AWESOME.

11:36.529 --> 11:40.033
ALL RIGHT,
NO ALCOHOL FOR YOU.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.904
MMM, OH.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.773
IS THAT HOW
YOU KNOW ADAM?

11:45.873 --> 11:48.441
- HOW?
- THROUGH A.A.

11:48.541 --> 11:52.312
OH, NO.
HE'S IN A.A.?

11:54.147 --> 11:56.049
OH, SHIT.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.751
I JUST BLEW
HIS ANONYMOUSNESS.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.020
OH, BALLS, MAN.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.688
DON'T TELL HIM,
ALL RIGHT?

12:01.789 --> 12:04.191
I JUST ASSUMED THAT
EVERYONE THAT KNEW HIM,

12:04.291 --> 12:07.594
LIKE, I MEAN, REALLY
KNEW HIM, KNEW THAT.

12:07.694 --> 12:10.931
THAT'S LIKE THE MAIN
DEFINING THING ABOUT
HIM, ISN'T IT?

12:12.099 --> 12:15.368
WELL, THAT AND HIS
LOVE OF BOOKS.

12:17.004 --> 12:19.072
WELL, HE'S GOT
LIKE HUGE EARS.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.774
WELL, YEAH.

12:20.874 --> 12:24.111
- SO THAT'S USUALLY
THE FIRST THING.
- YEAH.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.151
THIS IS A REALLY FAST MILE.
SO MANY CALORIES.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.253
- Ray: HEY!
- BURNING THE MOST CALORIES.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.122
HEY!

12:35.222 --> 12:36.689
I WAS IDEAL.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.792
I'M JUST SAYING,
IF I WERE A GUY,

12:38.892 --> 12:41.061
LIKE, YOU WOULD HAVE
TROUBLE GETTING OVER ME.

12:41.161 --> 12:43.263
I'M NOT BRAGGING.
I'M NOT BRAGGING.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.665
YOU WOULD JUST FIND IT
DIFFICULT TO, LIKE--

12:45.765 --> 12:48.936
TO PICK UP, PACK UP
YOUR BACKPACK--

12:53.340 --> 12:56.543
SO WHEN YOU TEXTED ME,
YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS ME?

12:56.643 --> 12:58.678
I RARELY SAVE A NUMBER.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.815
RIGHT.
RIGHT.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.251
WHERE'S KATHERINE?

13:04.351 --> 13:06.820
SHE'S WITH THE GIRLS
VISITING HER MOM.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.755
I STAYED HOME TO WORK.

13:08.856 --> 13:11.191
- WHY DO YOU DO THAT?
- DO WHAT?

13:11.291 --> 13:14.161
STAY HOME TO WORK
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.830
- WAY TO CUSHION THE BLOW.
- OH, COME ON.

13:16.930 --> 13:20.200
I DON'T CARE IF YOU
DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT
TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.670
BUT WHY NOT JUST LET THAT
BE YOUR THING FOR A WHILE?

13:23.770 --> 13:25.405
I CAN'T EXPLAIN
THIS TO YOU.

13:25.505 --> 13:26.974
OH, WHY IS THAT?

13:27.074 --> 13:29.676
BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID
IT WON'T SEEM SEXY?

13:29.776 --> 13:32.745
THIS IS INSANE.

13:32.846 --> 13:34.714
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I TEXTED YOU TO HANG OUT.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.716
OH, MY GOD.
I'M THAT GUY.

13:36.816 --> 13:40.520
I'M THE GUY THAT BRINGS
A BOTTLE OF WINE TO
A PARTY LIKE THIS.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.355
YEAH.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.824
WELL, MAYBE LET'S PUT A PIN
IN YOUR MIDLIFE CRISIS

13:44.925 --> 13:46.726
RIGHT NOW AND GO DANCE.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.361
COME ON.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.130
( bottle shatters )

13:50.230 --> 13:53.000
- Man: HEY!
- Man £2: YOU JUST
DROPPED A BOTTLE ON US!

13:53.100 --> 13:55.202
- THAT'S FUCKING DANGEROUS.
- JESUS.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.537
SORRY, WE DIDN'T KNOW
THAT YOU WERE DOWN THERE.

13:57.637 --> 14:01.341
I DID IT, AND I'D DO
IT AGAIN, YOU CRUSTY
SACKS OF SHIT.

14:01.441 --> 14:02.943
WHAT DID YOU CALL US?

14:03.043 --> 14:04.978
YOU HEARD ME.
CRUSTY.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.947
A CRUSTY?
REALLY?

14:07.047 --> 14:08.848
YOU'RE GONNA REDUCE US
TO A SUBCULTURE

14:08.949 --> 14:10.918
AND THEN NOT ACCURATELY
NAME THE SUBCULTURE?

14:11.018 --> 14:13.386
- NICE.
- BET YOU WERE BORN
ON A DIRT FLOOR.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.388
WHAT IS THAT FUCKING
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

14:15.488 --> 14:18.258
IT MEANS I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE COOL AND I THINK
YOUR MOTHER WAS POOR.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.027
WHAT DID YOU SAY
TO ME, BITCH?

14:20.127 --> 14:22.262
- OKAY, GUYS, LISTEN.
LET'S LET COOLER HEADS--
- ( spits )

14:22.362 --> 14:25.865
- COME ON.
- GOD, YOU JUST SPIT
ON CHARLES MANSON.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.201
* Bang, bang, bang

14:30.537 --> 14:34.741
* Feathers,
I'm plucking feathers *

14:34.841 --> 14:37.044
* One by one by one

14:37.144 --> 14:39.947
* No more skylarking

14:40.047 --> 14:42.482
* Around my head

14:42.582 --> 14:45.218
* Your information

14:45.318 --> 14:47.787
* But there's no hiding

14:47.887 --> 14:50.757
* Behind molting feathers

14:50.857 --> 14:53.826
* On the plane, in my brain,
about to do the sho' *

14:53.927 --> 14:56.363
* 40k contract,
take it out the do' *

14:56.463 --> 14:59.166
* Dice symbolize my life,
roll 'em on the flo'... *

14:59.266 --> 15:01.969
- OH, HEY, HANNAH, HI.
- HI.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.371
I JUST THOUGHT I SHOULD
COME OVER AND SAY HI TO YOU.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.373
NO, I'M GLAD YOU DID.
I SAW YOU EARLIER.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.475
I TRIED TO SAY HI,
BUT YOU COULDN'T HEAR ME.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.744
UM, YOU LOOK GREAT.
THAT'S A GREAT SHIRT.

15:11.844 --> 15:14.614
YOU JUST--
YOU SEEM GREAT.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.683
THANK YOU.

15:16.783 --> 15:19.119
* Je te plumerai la tete

15:19.219 --> 15:21.454
* Je te
plumerai la tete *

15:21.554 --> 15:24.457
* Oh, no, oh, no,
un, deux, trois *

15:24.557 --> 15:27.594
* No one ever does it
like that anymore *

15:27.694 --> 15:29.896
* Bang, bang, bang

15:29.997 --> 15:31.931
* When feathers fly,
you deny everything *

15:32.032 --> 15:35.135
* Alouette,
un, deux, trois *

15:35.235 --> 15:37.737
* No one ever does it
like that anymore *

15:37.837 --> 15:40.540
* Bang, bang, bang,
alouette *

15:40.640 --> 15:43.710
* When feathers fly,
you deny everything. *

15:45.045 --> 15:47.780
( panting )

15:47.880 --> 15:50.317
OKAY. OKAY.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.587
FINE.
OKAY.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.789
- LISTEN-- AH!

15:56.889 --> 15:58.658

15:58.758 --> 16:00.827

- OH, FUCK!

16:00.927 --> 16:02.595
FUCK!

16:02.695 --> 16:04.731
STOP CHASING ME!

16:04.831 --> 16:07.534
( groaning )

16:09.836 --> 16:11.738
YOUR-- YOUR COUS--

16:11.838 --> 16:14.141
YOUR COUSIN TOLD ME
TO STAY WITH YOU

16:14.241 --> 16:16.143
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT
YOU TO BE LEFT ALONE

16:16.243 --> 16:19.146
BECAUSE YOU SMOKED CRACK.
OKAY?

16:19.246 --> 16:21.881
FUCK. MY BALLS
ARE THROBBING.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.683
OH, MY GOD.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.218
OH, MY GOD,
I'M SO SORRY.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.787
I TOOK THIS MODEL MUGGING COURSE
AND YOU BEAT UP A GUY

16:27.887 --> 16:30.223
DRESSED LIKE A GIANT MATTRESS
TO LEARN SELF-DEFENSE.

16:30.323 --> 16:33.326
I DON'T HAVE
A MATTRESS, OKAY?

16:33.426 --> 16:35.162
AND YOU'RE
RIDICULOUSLY STRONG,

16:35.262 --> 16:37.230
LIKE INEXPLICABLY
MUTANT STRONG.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.899
I'VE REALLY NEVER TRIED IT
ON A REAL MAN BEFORE.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.769
I-- I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT WORKED SO WELL.

16:42.869 --> 16:46.406
IT'S AN HONOR
TO BE YOUR FIRST.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.209
I THINK IT WAS
PROBABLY THE CRACK.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.211
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
THE CRACK.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.313
THAT MIGHT HAVE HAD
SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.

16:53.413 --> 16:54.781
( exhales )

16:54.881 --> 16:58.618
I TOOK SPORTS THERAPY CLASS
LAST SEMESTER TO MEET JOCKS.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.520
IT WAS MOSTLY INDIAN GIRLS.

17:00.620 --> 17:03.756
BUT I COULD, LIKE, MASSAGE YOU
IN A NONSEXUAL WAY.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.761
YOU WANT TO MASSAGE MY GROIN
IN A NONSEXUAL WAY?

17:08.861 --> 17:10.463
YEAH, YEAH.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.031
IF IT'LL HELP.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.201
YEAH, OKAY.
YEAH, MAYBE IT'LL HELP.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.236
- OKAY, OKAY.
- YEAH.

17:25.845 --> 17:28.214
( exhales )

17:28.315 --> 17:30.183
YEAH, THIS ISN'T
SEXUAL AT ALL.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.685
- NO, IT'S NOT.
- ( distant sirens wailing )

17:36.656 --> 17:38.791
IT FEELS NICE.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.627
- GOOD.
- YEAH.

17:42.795 --> 17:45.064
CH-CH-CH-CH.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.600
( music playing )

17:59.846 --> 18:04.684
* Watch me move when I lose,
when I lose it hard *

18:06.919 --> 18:13.393
* Get you off with a touch
dancing in the dark *

18:13.493 --> 18:16.963
* You notice what I'm wearing,
I notice when you're staring *

18:17.063 --> 18:18.965
* You know that
I can take it... *

18:19.065 --> 18:21.634
ELIJAH?

18:21.734 --> 18:23.069
HI.
OH, MY GOD.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.205
- HI.
- HI.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.607
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

18:29.209 --> 18:32.078
IF YOU WANT TO BUST,
I'M GOING TO THE NAVY YARD
ON A SCRAPPING MISSION.

18:32.179 --> 18:33.513
WHAT FOR?

18:33.613 --> 18:35.248
I'M BUILDING A BOAT
THAT WE'RE GONNA SAIL

18:35.348 --> 18:37.217
DOWN THE HUDSON
ON THE 4th OF JULY.

18:37.317 --> 18:38.985
AND AS IT GOES,
IT'LL BREAK.

18:39.085 --> 18:40.953
IN THE LAST MILE
IT'S GONNA SINK.

18:41.053 --> 18:43.256
WILL YOU BE ON IT?

18:43.356 --> 18:45.892
- YEAH, WELL, I CAN SWIM.
- OH, COOL.

18:45.992 --> 18:47.560
DO YOU WANT TO COME WITH?

18:47.660 --> 18:50.897
I CAN'T GO SCRAPPING RIGHT NOW.
I'M HERE WITH MY FRIENDS.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.666
- COULD YOU HOLD MY BACKPACK?
- YEAH, OF COURSE I WILL.

18:53.766 --> 18:56.769
I WOULD DO ANYTHING
FOR YOU BECAUSE I THINK
YOU ARE VERY BRAVE

18:56.869 --> 18:59.406
AND HAVE COME
A VERY LONG WAY.

19:02.041 --> 19:05.212
OKAY, I AM READY TO ROCK.
AH!

19:05.312 --> 19:07.680
( music continues )

19:19.559 --> 19:21.628
OI!

19:29.736 --> 19:31.904
COULD YOU SLOW DOWN
A LITTLE BIT, PLEASE?

19:33.806 --> 19:35.708
THIS IS FUN.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.277
UH-HUH.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.379
I MEAN, IT'S ONLY
BEEN TWO WEEKS.

19:39.479 --> 19:42.114
TWO WEEKS.
I MEAN, I CAN'T
FUCKING BELIEVE IT.

19:42.215 --> 19:43.383
- I KNOW. IT'S AWFUL.
- IT'S UNREAL.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.084
AND HANNAH
COULD GIVE A SHIT.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.486
SHE'S LIKE,
"OH, THERE'S ADAM.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.321
I'LL GO TALK TO HIM.
SEE YOU LATER."

19:48.421 --> 19:49.756
- JUST LIKE SHE ALWAYS DOES.
- OH, I KNOW.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.158
- WELL, THAT'S OUR HANNAH.
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

19:52.259 --> 19:54.093
WHY AM I TELLING YOU
ABOUT HOW SELFISH HANNAH IS?

19:54.193 --> 19:57.430
- YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT.
- OH, I SURE DO.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.832
ELIJAH, IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.768
IT REALLY IS.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.604
YOU TWO ARE CUT
FROM THE SAME CLOTH,
AREN'T YOU?

20:04.704 --> 20:06.105
WHAT?

20:06.205 --> 20:08.074
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
SINCE COLLEGE,

20:08.174 --> 20:10.877
AND THEN YOU MAKE ME
LISTEN TO THE SAME CRAP

20:10.977 --> 20:14.281
I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO
SINCE 2006.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.516
IT ALL SOUNDS LIKE
VINTAGE HANNAH.

20:16.616 --> 20:19.218
NO, NO, NO.
I'M JUST IN A MOMENT
OF CRISIS.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.354
LIKE, YOU'RE HERE,
SO I'M TALKING TO YOU.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.356
HANNAH'S THE SELFISH ONE.
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.825
- HANNAH'S SELFISH?
- YES.

20:25.925 --> 20:29.095
WAS SHE SELFISH WHEN
YOU MADE OUT WITH ME
SOPHOMORE YEAR?

20:29.195 --> 20:31.197
THAT WAS DURING
"RENT" REHEARSALS.

20:31.298 --> 20:34.233
WAS IT?
BECAUSE I REMEMBER
HANNAH HAD MONO

20:34.334 --> 20:36.102
AND WE WERE IN
YOUR DORM ROOM

20:36.202 --> 20:38.037
AND YOUR NIPPLES GOT HARD.

20:38.137 --> 20:41.308
BUT WHATEVER YOU NEED
TO TELL YOURSELF TO GET
THROUGH THE NIGHT.

20:41.408 --> 20:44.176
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
THAT WAS SELFISH?

20:44.277 --> 20:45.445
HOW'S THIS FOR SELFISH?

20:45.545 --> 20:48.615
YOU DATED HANNAH
FOR TWO YEARS

20:48.715 --> 20:52.919
WHEN ALL THE WHILE
YOU WERE A SECRET QUEER.

20:53.019 --> 20:56.155
OH, SECRET.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.558
"RENT" REHEARSALS.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.727
WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHOSE
DICK YOU HAD TO SUCK
TO GET THAT PART,

21:00.827 --> 21:03.195
BECAUSE YOUR VOICE
SOUNDS LIKE A BAG
OF DYING BABIES.

21:03.296 --> 21:05.698
( gasps )

21:08.034 --> 21:09.569
THAT'S A DELICATE
SPOT FOR ME.

21:09.669 --> 21:13.740
I AM NEVER COMING BACK
TO BUSHWICK AGAIN, EVER!

21:13.840 --> 21:15.742
I'M REALLY SCARED, ADAM.
CAN YOU PLEASE STOP THE BIKE?

21:15.842 --> 21:18.044
WE'RE ALMOST
AT THE JUNK PLACE.
JUST KEEP HOLDING ON.

21:18.144 --> 21:20.179
WELL, I WANT TO WALK,

21:20.279 --> 21:22.849
SO PLEASE STOP
THE BIKE, ADAM.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.785
( brakes squeak )

21:25.885 --> 21:27.454
AW, SHIT.

21:27.554 --> 21:30.723
I'M TELLING YOU,
I'M HAVING APPENDICITIS.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.359
I NEED TO SEE SOMEONE.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.260
WE'LL CALL YOU
AS SOON AS THERE'S
SOME AVAILABILITY.

21:34.361 --> 21:36.396
MY DOCTOR GAVE ME
SOME VICODIN.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.565
IS THAT WHAT IT'S CALLED?
SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN.

21:38.665 --> 21:41.300
LOOK, MA'AM,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO WAIT YOUR TURN.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.307
I'M GONNA BURST

21:48.408 --> 21:50.643
ALL OVER THIS
FREAKIN' FLOOR

21:50.743 --> 21:53.380
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO CLEAN THAT CRAP UP.

21:53.480 --> 21:56.616
I'M ON TO HER.

21:56.716 --> 21:59.886
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GONNA
EXPLAIN THIS TO KATHERINE.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.690
JUST TELL HER THE TRUTH.

22:03.790 --> 22:07.494
THAT I FOLLOWED YOU
TO BUSHWICK AND GOT
BEAT UP BY CRUSTY PUNKS?

22:09.095 --> 22:11.398
THAT WAS CLEARLY
YOUR FIRST FIGHT.

22:11.498 --> 22:14.000
YOU'RE LUCKY IT
WASN'T YOUR LAST.

22:14.100 --> 22:17.336
I HEARD THAT IN
A BOXING GYM ONCE.

22:18.204 --> 22:20.840
( sighs )

22:22.141 --> 22:24.343
( crying )

22:24.444 --> 22:26.112
OH, GOD.

22:26.212 --> 22:28.615
I'M SO SORRY.

22:32.118 --> 22:34.687
- ( snorting )
- SHH.

22:41.293 --> 22:43.930
THIS FEELS SO GOOD.

22:45.832 --> 22:48.601
SHH, SHH.

22:48.701 --> 22:51.638
YOU SHOULD-- YOU SHOULD
COME HOME WITH ME.

22:51.738 --> 22:54.006
LET'S SPEND
THE NIGHT TOGETHER.

22:54.106 --> 22:57.410
I MEAN, WE WON'T
DO ANYTHING.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.446
WE'LL JUST--

22:59.546 --> 23:02.415
WE'LL JUST KEEP
EACH OTHER COMPANY.

23:04.116 --> 23:05.718
- I'M SICK.
- NO.

23:05.818 --> 23:08.387
I'M SICK.

23:08.488 --> 23:11.624
I CAN'T--
I CAN'T DO THIS KIND
OF THING ANYMORE.

23:14.961 --> 23:16.629
YOU'RE A TEASE.

23:18.330 --> 23:21.468
I LIKED YOU BETTER
WHEN YOU WERE BEING
THE GOOD GUY.

23:24.103 --> 23:26.473
AIN'T THAT THE WAY?

23:27.774 --> 23:30.477
DON'T BE CROSS.
WE CAN STILL BE FRIENDS.

23:30.577 --> 23:33.112
WE WEREN'T FRIENDS
TO BEGIN WITH.

23:33.212 --> 23:34.981
YOU WORK FOR MY KIDS.

23:37.984 --> 23:41.788
- ( phone chiming )
- YOU OKAY?

23:49.762 --> 23:52.231
- HELLO.
- Marnie: Where are you?

23:52.331 --> 23:55.234
LIKE A FUCKING HEAP
OF TRASH SOMEWHERE.
I DON'T KNOW.

23:55.334 --> 23:56.936
Send me a drop pin.

23:57.036 --> 23:59.171
OKAY.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.611
YOU OKAY?

24:04.711 --> 24:07.246
I'LL BE A LOT MORE OKAY
IF YOU LEAVE ME ALONE.

24:07.346 --> 24:08.915
I'M SENDING A DROP PIN.

24:09.015 --> 24:10.783
OKAY.

24:13.520 --> 24:16.489
TAKO TOLD ME
THAT YOU'RE AN ALCOHOLIC.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.860
I DON'T DRINK, NO.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.463
BUT YOU'RE LIKE IN A.A.
THAT'S LIKE A WHOLE THING
YOU NEVER TOLD ME.

24:24.564 --> 24:27.634
IT'S BEEN A PART OF
MY LIFE SINCE I WAS 17.

24:27.734 --> 24:29.636
IT'S A BIG PART
OF MY LIFE.

24:29.736 --> 24:31.470
YEAH, I MEAN, I GUESS
IF YOU'RE DRINKING,

24:31.571 --> 24:33.773
YOU CAN'T STEER YOUR SINKING
4th OF JULY BOAT.

24:33.873 --> 24:37.143
- BUT YOU NEVER TOLD ME.
- YOU NEVER ASKED.

24:37.243 --> 24:39.078
WAS I SUPPOSED
TO FUCKING GUESS?

24:39.178 --> 24:41.380
'CAUSE YOU DON'T REALLY
SEEM LIKE YOU'RE IN RECOVERY
FROM MUCH.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.982
I THINK YOU MIGHT BE
A SEX ADDICT.

24:43.082 --> 24:44.350
YOU'RE RIGHT, I MAY BE.

24:44.450 --> 24:46.485
AGAIN, THAT'S SHIT
YOU SHOULD HAVE SHARED!

24:46.586 --> 24:48.187
YOU NEVER ASKED!

24:48.287 --> 24:49.956
YOU NEVER ASK ME ANYTHING

24:50.056 --> 24:52.659
BESIDES "DOES THIS FEEL OKAY"
OR "DO YOU LIKE MY SKIRT"

24:52.759 --> 24:54.093
OR "HOW MUCH IS YOUR RENT?"

24:54.193 --> 24:55.695
I'M NOT GONNA FUCKING
TALK YOUR EAR OFF

24:55.795 --> 24:58.330
ABOUT SHIT
YOU DON'T ASK ABOUT.

24:58.430 --> 25:00.399
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW ME.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.769
YOU WANT TO COME OVER
IN THE NIGHT AND HAVE ME
FUCK THE DOG SHIT OUT OF YOU.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.837
THEN YOU WANT TO LEAVE
AND WRITE ABOUT IT
IN YOUR DIARY.

25:04.937 --> 25:06.873
YOU DON'T WANT
TO KNOW ME.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.777
DO YOU EVER EVEN THINK
ABOUT ME WHEN I'M NOT THERE?

25:10.877 --> 25:12.645
SEE?

25:18.017 --> 25:19.652
STEP AWAY FROM HER!

25:20.953 --> 25:22.054
WHO ARE YOU?

25:22.154 --> 25:24.991
I'M HER BEST FRIEND,
AND I WILL NOT HESITATE

25:25.091 --> 25:27.393
TO PRESS CHARGES IF YOU
DON'T STEP AWAY FROM HER.

25:27.493 --> 25:29.328
I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU

25:29.428 --> 25:31.798
AND YOUR SICK
INSTINCTS, OKAY?

25:31.898 --> 25:34.834
AND I'M NOT SCARED TO BE
VERY CLEAR WITH PEOPLE

25:34.934 --> 25:37.837
ABOUT THE KIND OF MAN
THAT YOU ARE.

25:37.937 --> 25:39.939
I AM SO FUCKING
OUT OF HERE.

25:40.039 --> 25:42.942
OH, THAT'S A REAL CHANGE.
I'D NEVER EXPECT THAT
FROM YOU.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.744
YOU SOUND LIKE
A SCHOOLTEACHER.

25:44.844 --> 25:48.014
YEAH, WELL, ENJOY
GOING THROUGH LIFE
AS YOURSELF.

25:48.114 --> 25:50.316
WAIT.

25:52.118 --> 25:54.020
HANNAH.

25:56.856 --> 25:59.091
- YOUR BACKPACK.
- THANKS.

25:59.191 --> 26:00.492
HANNAH.

26:00.593 --> 26:03.863
LOOK, KID, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME.

26:03.963 --> 26:06.298
DO YOU WANT ME TO BE
YOUR BOYFRIEND?

26:07.934 --> 26:10.670
IS THAT IT?
DO YOU WANT ME TO BE
YOUR FUCKING BOYFRIEND?

26:11.804 --> 26:14.173
( woman vocalizing )

26:30.623 --> 26:32.859
* HAS IT BEEN A DAY
OR A WEEK? *

26:32.959 --> 26:35.594
* AS MY EYES
BEGIN TO CLOSE *

26:35.695 --> 26:39.598
* I AM WALKING
IN MY SLEEP *

26:39.699 --> 26:42.468
* LIVING IN A STATE
IN-BETWEEN *

26:42.568 --> 26:44.804
* DO THE SIGNS
BEGIN TO SHOW? *

26:44.904 --> 26:47.740
* SEE THE EYES
THERE IN THE DARK *

26:47.840 --> 26:52.311
* AS THEY GLOW

26:52.411 --> 26:56.649
* AS THEY GLOW

26:59.218 --> 27:00.720
* THESE DREAMS

27:00.820 --> 27:03.589
* DANCE UNDER MY PILLOW

27:03.690 --> 27:08.460
* IN THE TWILIGHT
OF THESE WHITE NIGHTS *

27:08.560 --> 27:12.631
* THESE DREAMS
UNDER MY PILLOW *

27:12.732 --> 27:15.034
* IN THE BRIGHT LIGHTS

27:15.134 --> 27:19.972
* OF THESE
WHITE NIGHTS *

27:20.072 --> 27:24.443
* OF THESE WHITE NIGHTS

27:24.543 --> 27:29.348
* OF THESE
WHITE NIGHTS *

27:29.448 --> 27:33.753
* OF THESE WHITE NIGHTS.

27:36.188 --> 27:38.324
( vocalizing )
