WOMAN: Kanan!

13:24.170 --> 13:28.210
I'm sorry, Ezra,
but you must see.

13:28.210 --> 13:31.000
Kanan found the moment
when he was needed most,

13:31.000 --> 13:33.670
and he did
what he had to do,

13:33.670 --> 13:35.120
for everyone.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.710
That's the lesson.

I didn't see it, but now...

13:45.210 --> 13:48.420
Sometimes I wish
my life were different.

13:48.420 --> 13:51.080
I wish I could see
my mom and dad.

13:52.620 --> 13:54.420
Why can't things be
like they were?

(THUNDER CRACKLES)

13:58.000 --> 13:59.580
We can't stay here.

13:59.580 --> 14:02.120
You opened the door
to this world.

14:02.120 --> 14:03.580
Do you know
how to close it?

14:03.580 --> 14:05.420
Sabine will know.

14:05.420 --> 14:07.580
We can do it together.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.540
They'll be so happy
to see you.

14:10.790 --> 14:12.620
I can't go with you.

Come on. Hurry.

14:39.620 --> 14:40.710
Almost got it.

14:40.710 --> 14:42.210
Get ready
to send Sabine a signal.

14:42.210 --> 14:44.420
I'll tap it out
right before blastoff.

14:48.830 --> 14:52.580
The Father is clearly
showing the way
to the portal.

14:52.580 --> 14:54.790
The wolves are
the portal guardians.

14:54.790 --> 14:56.790
Okay.
What about the owl?

14:56.790 --> 14:58.620
A servant of the Daughter,

14:58.620 --> 15:01.830
or possibly
the Daughter herself

15:01.830 --> 15:04.210
when acting
as a spirit guide.

15:04.210 --> 15:07.790
Hmm... So if the Daughter
opens the gateway...

15:07.790 --> 15:11.380
The Son would close it.
Huh.

15:11.380 --> 15:13.420
There's something
I didn't know.

15:13.420 --> 15:17.210
Yeah, see?
We can help each other.
