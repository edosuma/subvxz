00:00.200 --> 00:01.815
Previously on "Eye Candy"...

00:01.835 --> 00:03.469
A serial killer party?

00:03.490 --> 00:06.152
It's a celebration
for the people of New York.

00:06.172 --> 00:08.374
If you wanted to kill me,
I'd be dead already.

00:08.508 --> 00:10.595
That's my girl.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.963
They're hiding something
from you, Lindy.

00:14.097 --> 00:16.047
Do you know anything
about my sister?

00:16.181 --> 00:18.133
You're not afraid.
You should be.

00:18.301 --> 00:20.699
You all should be.

00:27.199 --> 00:29.588
I promise you
won't feel a thing.

00:29.946 --> 00:31.730
But I'll be awake
the whole time?

00:31.865 --> 00:33.532
I know it seems crazy but
the brain doesn't have any

00:33.650 --> 00:36.535
pain receptors,
so you won't feel any pain.

00:36.653 --> 00:38.654
- I swear.
- That's supposed to make

00:38.788 --> 00:41.540
- me feel better?
- Dr. Wells has done this

00:41.658 --> 00:43.768
like a hundred times.

You're doing great.

00:59.643 --> 01:01.677
I found the focal point of your
seizures and I'm just gonna

01:01.811 --> 01:04.450
- ask you a few questions.
- Okay.

01:05.682 --> 01:07.490
What color is that?

01:09.319 --> 01:11.243
Yellow.

01:15.199 --> 01:17.463
Try again. Now what color is it?

01:18.580 --> 01:20.674
Red. It's red.

01:21.364 --> 01:23.866
There we go. And can you tell me

01:24.000 --> 01:25.862
what this is?

01:30.040 --> 01:33.180
Will you check that, please?

01:38.264 --> 01:41.122
Is she okay? She okay?

01:44.354 --> 01:46.638
You are doing...
you're doing grea...

01:48.391 --> 01:50.976
What's happening? Help!

01:51.111 --> 01:53.779
Help! Help me!

Oh, God, that's inedible.
Look, I...

02:06.292 --> 02:08.577
I really have no idea
what I'm doing right now.

02:08.711 --> 02:11.840
Yeah, he thinks we're going
a restaurant, but he cooked for me,

02:11.860 --> 02:14.583
so it was like a challenge.
Jake is almost here

02:14.603 --> 02:16.642
there is no turning back, Sophia.

02:16.662 --> 02:19.304
At least after this is over,
I'll never have to do it again,

02:19.422 --> 02:21.006
if he lives to tell the tale.

02:22.092 --> 02:22.975
Oh, God, he's here.

02:23.093 --> 02:23.926
I gotta go.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.663
Hey.

02:45.100 --> 02:46.165
Hey.

02:46.282 --> 02:47.166
You okay?

02:47.283 --> 02:48.784
Yeah, why?

02:48.952 --> 02:51.036
'Cause I haven't heard
from you in a week.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.788
I needed a break.

02:52.956 --> 02:54.957
Last week was kind of
a tough week.

02:55.125 --> 02:56.175
Yeah.

02:56.292 --> 02:57.876
Yeah, it was.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.018
Your face looks better.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.381
Can I come in?

03:02.515 --> 03:04.383
Uh, sure, but it's
got to be quick.

03:04.517 --> 03:05.634
I got a thing.

03:05.769 --> 03:07.136
A thing?

03:07.270 --> 03:08.303
What kind of thing.

03:08.471 --> 03:09.638
A thing.

03:12.142 --> 03:13.142
Oh.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.941
That kind of thing.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.622
What's his name?

03:18.148 --> 03:19.982
Is he late? He's late, isn't he?

03:20.116 --> 03:21.984
No.
And it's none of your business.

03:22.118 --> 03:24.153
- What are you doing here?
- I need a favor.

03:24.287 --> 03:25.871
- A favor?
- Yeah.

03:25.989 --> 03:27.889
Really, what kind of favor?

03:28.491 --> 03:30.768
What... hey, that is not for you.

03:31.161 --> 03:34.163
- You forgot the basil.
- Oh, God!

03:34.330 --> 03:36.248
- I did, didn't I?
- Yep.

03:40.336 --> 03:42.029
Hang on a sec.

03:43.173 --> 03:44.400
Hi.

03:47.010 --> 03:49.130
Oh, no, that sucks.

03:49.479 --> 03:52.681
No, seriously, it's okay.
Really, don't worry about it.

03:52.849 --> 03:55.434
I'll... I'll cancel
the reservation.

03:55.568 --> 03:58.468
Sure. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

04:02.025 --> 04:04.226
Jake Bolin stood you up, huh?

04:04.527 --> 04:07.902
- Looks that way.
- What's going on with him?

04:08.331 --> 04:10.917
Just tell me
what you want, Tommy.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.702
An old friend of mine
is in trouble.

04:13.870 --> 04:16.088
Need a little help,
off the books.

04:16.206 --> 04:18.707
Off the books?
What exactly do you mean?

04:18.875 --> 04:20.759
This friend's a neurosurgeon
at Manhattan east

04:20.877 --> 04:23.712
memorial hospital.
Last week, Dr. Wells

04:23.880 --> 04:26.098
was in the middle of awake
neurosurgery on a 16-year-old

04:26.216 --> 04:29.101
kid when the whole
operating team passed out.

04:29.219 --> 04:32.054
Had the kid's brains
literally in their hands.

04:32.188 --> 04:34.796
- That's not good.
- Kid suffered severed hemorrhaging.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.808
Hospital says it's human error.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.778
The anesthesiologist messed up.
Seems the nitrous oxide

04:39.896 --> 04:43.115
regulator leaked gas into
the or, put everyone to sleep.

04:43.233 --> 04:45.086
But?

04:45.106 --> 04:47.402
Machines all over the hospital have
been shutting down and rebooting for

04:47.537 --> 04:50.270
weeks for no reason,
everything from ventilators

04:50.290 --> 04:52.189
to bypass machines.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.078
Let me guess.
This nitrous oxide regulator

04:56.246 --> 04:58.853
is wireless and fully automated.

04:59.415 --> 05:02.251
- Yep.
- In other words...

05:02.385 --> 05:05.254
- hackable.
- Exactly.

05:05.421 --> 05:07.923
The hospital's like the most
vulnerable place on the planet.

05:08.057 --> 05:11.260
Any kid with a mediocre setup
and half a brain could hack in.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.512
You think someone's trying to
sabotage the equipment?

05:13.646 --> 05:15.430
- Did anyone die?
- Not yet.

05:15.598 --> 05:18.100
IT is denying there's a problem.
Seems they just spent

05:18.234 --> 05:20.352
five million on a new
state-of-the-art network

05:20.486 --> 05:23.033
they claim is impenetrable.

05:23.053 --> 05:25.254
You know nothing's impenetrable.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.115
Yup. Looks like this is

05:33.283 --> 05:35.951
a closed network with
no remote connectivity.

05:36.085 --> 05:37.502
It's got to be someone
on the inside.

05:37.620 --> 05:39.955
I know somebody's covering
something up.

05:40.089 --> 05:41.957
And, look,
I don't want to go in guns

05:42.091 --> 05:45.177
blazing with a warrant and
alert whoever is doing this.

05:45.295 --> 05:47.546
We need to keep this quiet for
now until we have something

05:47.680 --> 05:49.955
more concrete to go on.

05:50.967 --> 05:54.519
So you want me to go in
and find out what's going on?

05:54.952 --> 05:56.428
Yes.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.357
And what's in it for me?

06:00.109 --> 06:01.765
Thought it'd be fun.

06:07.150 --> 06:09.318
All you gotta do
is get in the server room.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.987
Once we perform a correlative
log analysis, we'll know if this

06:12.155 --> 06:14.406
is just operational error
or if someone really is

06:14.540 --> 06:18.036
- messing with the hospital.
- I've done much worse.

06:18.056 --> 06:19.545
I know.

06:20.997 --> 06:23.975
That her? That's Dr. Wells?

06:24.717 --> 06:26.038
Yep.

06:27.003 --> 06:28.569
She's hot.

06:29.172 --> 06:30.294
Yep.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.818
So you and her were...

06:35.178 --> 06:36.919
For a summer.

06:37.647 --> 06:41.200
A neurosurgeon and a cop.
How did that work out?

06:42.151 --> 06:43.620
It didn't.

06:44.187 --> 06:46.071
This isn't gonna be
a problem, is it?

06:46.189 --> 06:49.419
'Cause it really seems like
a whole conflict-of-interest thing.

06:54.747 --> 06:58.417
- I haven't got much time.
- This is Lindy Samson.

06:58.534 --> 07:00.535
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:00.703 --> 07:04.206
- Who is she?
- We work together.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.435
I borrowed this from the IT department.

07:06.455 --> 07:08.147
It'll get you into
the server room.

07:08.167 --> 07:09.798
I need it back in about
an hour or so.

07:09.818 --> 07:11.880
Okay, then. Be right back.

07:17.220 --> 07:19.684
I'm putting my job
on the line here.

07:20.390 --> 07:22.240
This better work.

07:23.026 --> 07:26.285
Is she good? Better than you?

07:26.729 --> 07:29.019
Some of the time.

07:35.238 --> 07:37.406
Dr. Vinet, please report to OR four.

07:37.540 --> 07:38.990
Dr. Vinet, OR four.

08:19.832 --> 08:23.118
Uh, this is weird.
I found a rogue wireless access

08:23.286 --> 08:26.121
point on the fourth floor.
It could be a window.

08:26.255 --> 08:29.291
- The fourth floor is the ICU.
- There's an unusual port open.

08:29.425 --> 08:33.494
It's moving a lot of traffic.
This could be what the hacker is using.

08:34.263 --> 08:37.299
I pinpointed the rogue
WIP's Mac address.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.724
Hooking into WiFi now.

08:41.136 --> 08:42.554
Okay, you got us what we need.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.192
Come back and we'll discuss
the next steps.

08:47.600 --> 08:50.131
I've got a better idea.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.294
George, I need your help.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.072
What's taking her so long?

09:27.850 --> 09:32.093
What carpet cleaning van
has an omnidirectional antenna on it?

09:36.859 --> 09:40.529
So you definitely have
a fever and you have

09:40.696 --> 09:43.248
an elevated heart rate.
We're gonna see what your

09:43.366 --> 09:45.292
blood work tells us.

10:09.725 --> 10:12.110
George, she's entering my
blood into the system now.

10:12.228 --> 10:15.063
You know hospitals are
giant petri dishes, right?

10:15.231 --> 10:17.649
Last year, 75,000 people
checked into hospitals for

10:17.783 --> 10:20.068
routine procedures
and ended up dying from

10:20.203 --> 10:22.404
staph infections,
food poisoning, ebola.

10:22.538 --> 10:24.573
- George, shut up.
- Okay.

10:24.740 --> 10:28.126
- Did you get access?
- Your MiFi is purring

10:28.244 --> 10:31.413
like a kitten. Hold on.

10:31.547 --> 10:34.082
Boom, I'm in. Okay, so how sick

10:34.217 --> 10:37.746
- do you want to be?
- Sick enough to get me into the ICU.

10:39.755 --> 10:43.020
I gotta go check on something,
I'll meet you back at the hospital.

10:45.728 --> 10:48.495
Yeager, I need you down at
Manhattan East Memorial Hospital.

10:48.515 --> 10:50.240
Got a problem.

10:52.935 --> 10:55.437
- What'd you give me?
- Hold on.

10:55.571 --> 10:59.107
Just a little case of
neurosyphilis.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.276
- Neurosyphilis?
- Sorry.

11:01.444 --> 11:03.778
Sorry, I panicked.
But it says here it's

11:03.946 --> 11:05.780
a big enough deal to get you
admitted into the ICU.

11:05.948 --> 11:07.532
- I hate you.
- You're gonna hate me

11:07.667 --> 11:09.868
even more,
'cause it's kind of a big deal.

11:10.002 --> 11:14.193
You should have a seizure,
faint or something... ha.

11:29.908 --> 11:31.538
I'll be right back.

11:52.764 --> 11:53.431
Hi.

11:54.766 --> 11:56.692
They just leave you here?

11:57.319 --> 12:00.489
- Yeah.
- They do that.

12:01.106 --> 12:04.582
They forget that we're
people with places to go.

12:04.993 --> 12:08.069
I'm not actually going anywhere
attached to all this, but...

12:08.280 --> 12:10.865
You're new. I'm Erika.

12:10.999 --> 12:13.866
- Lindy.
- What are you in for?

12:15.120 --> 12:20.071
Um, I'm not sure.
Neuro... something.

12:20.625 --> 12:22.587
I can't even pronounce it.

12:23.929 --> 12:27.064
You?
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

12:27.199 --> 12:32.284
I can pronounce it really well.
I've had a ton of practice.

12:33.660 --> 12:38.040
- Okay, Erika, CT is ready for you.
- This is about as exciting as it gets.

12:38.060 --> 12:39.306
First take these.

12:39.326 --> 12:42.813
They feed me like 20 of these
a day so my liver won't explode.

12:42.948 --> 12:46.372
- I thought it was your heart.
- Well, when you're half-machine,

12:46.392 --> 12:48.923
body parts tend to rebel.

12:49.204 --> 12:51.322
- Complications.
- Come on, sweetie,

12:51.490 --> 12:53.518
let's not talk like that.

12:55.827 --> 12:58.045
Let's go.

13:02.503 --> 13:04.612
Like ships in the night.

13:11.143 --> 13:13.174
Open up, NYPD.

13:16.848 --> 13:18.766
Oh. You.

13:18.900 --> 13:21.185
- Yes, me.
- Great.

13:24.356 --> 13:26.574
What exactly have we got here?

13:26.691 --> 13:28.576
Nothing. Pizza?

13:28.693 --> 13:30.611
Looks like a lot more
than nothing to me.

13:30.746 --> 13:32.196
Does it? I don't know.

13:32.330 --> 13:34.248
You're wirelessly routed
directly to the command server

13:34.366 --> 13:36.867
at the hospital.
Not exactly legal.

13:37.002 --> 13:40.087
Well, you know, that depends
on your definition of "legal."

13:40.205 --> 13:43.810
- The opposite of "illegal."
- Ah, yes, that would make sense.

13:43.830 --> 13:45.126
Where's Lindy?

13:45.260 --> 13:47.878
Lindy, I don't know...
who that, who that?

13:48.046 --> 13:51.628
Who, who that?
I don't know, I don't know.

13:51.767 --> 13:53.217
You want me to impound this van?

13:53.351 --> 13:55.190
Do whatever you want.

13:56.448 --> 13:58.939
Listen, George.
If something happens to Lindy,

13:59.057 --> 14:01.250
it's gonna be on you.

14:07.399 --> 14:09.233
Okay, fine.

14:09.534 --> 14:11.652
Lindy checked herself into
the ICU to get closer to the

14:11.787 --> 14:13.621
rogue access point,
but it's no big deal.

14:13.738 --> 14:16.157
- It's no biggie.
- Here we go again.

14:16.291 --> 14:18.409
All right. You watch Lindy,

14:18.577 --> 14:20.244
- Yeager watches you.
- What?

14:20.378 --> 14:22.229
You heard me.

14:30.555 --> 14:32.602
Do you ever smile?

14:38.230 --> 14:41.265
Uh, neurosyphilis occurs in
people who have had a chronic

14:41.399 --> 14:44.935
or untreated infection
for about ten to 20 years.

14:45.103 --> 14:48.939
And, in your case, that would
make you like an infant when

14:49.074 --> 14:51.992
you contracted the bacteria.
Now, we'll need to

14:52.110 --> 14:54.387
run some more tests.

15:50.302 --> 15:52.836
Would you just listen to
sense for once in your life?

15:52.971 --> 15:55.089
Well, I won't accept that.
Where are you going?

15:55.223 --> 15:56.975
To get some air.

16:00.645 --> 16:02.846
Hey. Lindy.

16:04.516 --> 16:06.395
Everything okay?

16:08.853 --> 16:13.407
That's Mark.
He has a flair for the dramatic.

16:14.029 --> 16:15.928
He's British.

16:19.164 --> 16:23.083
I hate flowers.
They die so quick.

16:23.201 --> 16:25.610
Cactuses are hard to kill.

16:29.341 --> 16:31.766
Say hello to big vad.

16:32.377 --> 16:35.045
Hooked me up to this ticker
four days ago.

16:35.213 --> 16:37.851
It's the only thing
keeping me alive.

16:38.550 --> 16:40.270
It's freaky, huh?

16:42.220 --> 16:43.819
It's tough.

16:45.223 --> 16:48.892
You never really appreciate
how vulnerable you are until

16:49.027 --> 16:51.011
something like this hits you.

16:51.229 --> 16:53.120
How could you?

16:54.282 --> 16:58.911
What's going on with you?
You're carrying something heavy.

17:00.288 --> 17:02.299
What?

17:02.319 --> 17:07.161
When you dance as close to death as I have,
you see things clearly.

17:07.551 --> 17:11.311
And you certainly don't have
time to be tactful.

17:14.301 --> 17:16.884
I lost someone recently.

17:18.223 --> 17:20.029
A boy someone.

17:21.726 --> 17:25.897
Yeah. Not sure what Mark's
gonna do when I go.

17:26.564 --> 17:29.172
I think I might be
his best friend.

17:30.485 --> 17:32.088
He'll survive.

17:32.604 --> 17:34.222
He will.

17:38.243 --> 17:39.962
Careful in here.

17:40.662 --> 17:43.064
It's all a big machine.

17:43.448 --> 17:46.440
Money is the only thing
they really care about.

17:47.002 --> 17:48.636
I gotta sleep.

17:49.120 --> 17:52.233
Hey, keep up the fight.

17:52.957 --> 17:54.491
Sure.

18:44.559 --> 18:46.510
You an organ donor?
'Cause I heard there's these

18:46.678 --> 18:49.263
doctors who let people die
just so they can harvest their

18:49.397 --> 18:53.901
organs for big moolah,
dinero, cha-ching.

18:54.018 --> 18:56.236
- How do you sleep at night?
- On my back.

18:56.354 --> 18:58.572
Well, sometimes if it's cold,
in the fetal position.

18:58.690 --> 19:01.525
And I get real...
You don't care.

19:01.693 --> 19:05.060
Yes, she found it.
Logs are coming in.

19:28.553 --> 19:30.225
What are you doing?

19:31.389 --> 19:33.107
- Meditating.
- Well, you really shouldn't

19:33.224 --> 19:34.641
be walking around.
We've got to get you

19:34.776 --> 19:36.977
- ready for more tests.
- Okay.

19:44.736 --> 19:47.988
I need to extract some of
your cerebral spinal fluid.

19:48.123 --> 19:51.158
I'll be inserting this needle
into the base of your spine.

19:51.292 --> 19:54.328
Okay, really, I'm fine.
No, seriously,

19:54.462 --> 19:56.497
- I feel so much better now.
- Big exhale on

19:56.631 --> 19:59.062
the count of three.

20:00.251 --> 20:01.507
One.

20:02.720 --> 20:03.865
Two.

20:04.076 --> 20:05.689
- Three.
- Sweetheart.

20:08.053 --> 20:10.895
You didn't call
and tell me you were sick.

20:13.148 --> 20:15.983
That you were in the ICU.
I didn't want to

20:16.100 --> 20:19.436
bother you, honey.
You've got a lot on your plate.

20:19.571 --> 20:23.287
- Yeah, who are you?
- Her fiance.

20:23.441 --> 20:25.659
We need to communicate
better, darling.

20:25.777 --> 20:28.612
It can be very disturbing
when you do things on your own.

20:28.780 --> 20:31.165
But we agreed,
you can't control me,

20:31.282 --> 20:33.909
I don't work for you.

20:35.453 --> 20:37.287
You know what? Go ahead.

20:37.455 --> 20:40.340
- Test away.
- Then give her a hug.

20:40.458 --> 20:43.331
It'll alleviate the pressure
on her spine.

20:43.795 --> 20:46.680
Now, sit up, lean forward,
arms around his neck.

20:46.798 --> 20:49.718
I am going to kill you.

20:51.603 --> 20:53.804
Okay. You'll feel a small pinch.

20:53.972 --> 20:57.191
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Is this test really necessary?

20:57.308 --> 21:00.194
Sir, your fiance is very sick.

21:00.311 --> 21:03.287
I presume the two of you
are intimate?

21:03.648 --> 21:06.675
Because you're gonna
have to get tested, too.

21:08.536 --> 21:10.144
Tommy?

21:10.788 --> 21:13.569
What are you doing here?
What's going on?

21:14.209 --> 21:18.161
The, uh...
Doctor here thinks my fiance...

21:18.296 --> 21:20.159
Fiance, really?

21:20.832 --> 21:24.218
Why is your fiance
getting a lumbar puncture?

21:24.335 --> 21:27.421
- Uh, neurosyphilis.
- Wow.

21:27.555 --> 21:30.507
She certainly does get around,
doesn't she?

21:30.642 --> 21:33.176
Yes. Yes, she does.

21:33.311 --> 21:34.678
Murphy, I'll take care of this.

21:34.846 --> 21:37.465
- Friends of the family.
- Fine.

21:43.688 --> 21:46.109
Could you just... Thanks.

21:47.525 --> 21:50.067
Could I talk to you
outside, please?

21:54.499 --> 21:57.584
I came to you because I thought
this could be discreet.

21:57.702 --> 22:00.254
I could lose my job if they
find out I snuck your fiance

22:00.371 --> 22:02.706
into the server room.
What is going on?

22:05.043 --> 22:06.627
Hey. I've analyzed the logs

22:06.761 --> 22:09.263
from the RAP.
A singular IP address from

22:09.380 --> 22:12.599
a hospital-issued tablet
logged on at the time

22:12.717 --> 22:15.218
of the last attack.
The tablet was assigned to

22:15.386 --> 22:17.892
a nurse, Lawrence Kennedy.

22:21.776 --> 22:23.103
Work.

22:24.896 --> 22:27.281
When did the last
intrusion occur?

22:27.398 --> 22:29.965
Five days ago.
Why are you whispering?

22:31.452 --> 22:32.633
Lindy?

22:35.707 --> 22:38.402
Linds?

22:51.089 --> 22:53.423
She's displaying no sign.
Check her ITS.

22:58.932 --> 22:59.813
She's cyanotic.

22:59.931 --> 23:02.655
What are you doing?
Get out of the way.

23:03.985 --> 23:05.602
There's a malfunction
here, doctor.

23:05.770 --> 23:07.604
- Vad's not operational.
- What the hell do you mean?

23:07.739 --> 23:09.656
- Total shutdown.
- Talk to me.

23:09.774 --> 23:11.825
BP is 84 over 58
and it's falling.

23:11.943 --> 23:13.599
Defib.

23:13.844 --> 23:15.706
I don't have a pulse.

23:16.202 --> 23:18.374
Everyone clear.

23:19.450 --> 23:20.955
- Clear.
- Clear.

23:25.686 --> 23:27.051
Clear!

23:31.022 --> 23:31.907
Clear!

23:35.433 --> 23:37.188
Clear!

23:48.284 --> 23:49.791
I'm gonna call it.

23:49.811 --> 23:53.422
- Nurse, what's the time?
- Time of death, 2:18.

24:14.451 --> 24:16.963
There was a complete
shutdown of her artificial heart.

24:16.983 --> 24:18.727
It looks that way.

24:18.851 --> 24:21.283
I was just talking to her
less than an hour ago.

24:21.303 --> 24:24.832
Look, whoever's doing this
just committed the first murder.

24:28.034 --> 24:29.549
This whole floor has people

24:29.666 --> 24:32.385
hooked up to machines.
All of them could die if we

24:32.503 --> 24:34.816
don't find out what's going on.

24:40.845 --> 24:42.462
I need to question the nurse
whose tablet was used.

24:42.596 --> 24:44.380
Wait? If it's him, he could

24:44.548 --> 24:46.299
- trigger another event.
- Well, that's a risk

24:46.433 --> 24:48.321
we'll have to take.

24:54.725 --> 24:58.722
George, I need you to check
nurse Kennedy's social media.

25:02.566 --> 25:05.189
I was wondering
if I could have a word.

25:05.736 --> 25:08.404
Sweetheart. I changed my mind.

25:09.740 --> 25:11.958
Kennedy was at riotfest
in Chicago last week when

25:12.076 --> 25:13.743
- the hacker last checked in.
- So who else would have

25:13.878 --> 25:15.969
access to his tablet?

25:17.581 --> 25:19.258
Anyone.

25:24.088 --> 25:25.800
Everyone.

25:57.171 --> 25:59.082
I'm sorry about Erika.

25:59.340 --> 26:01.624
Thanks.
I just met her earlier today

26:01.792 --> 26:04.599
but she seemed really strong.

26:04.962 --> 26:08.348
Yeah, well,
hooked up to a machine like that

26:08.465 --> 26:10.767
wasn't any way to live.

26:20.644 --> 26:23.129
What am I supposed to
do with this?

26:24.315 --> 26:26.430
I can't throw it out
and I can't keep it

26:26.450 --> 26:29.402
because every time I see it...
Oh, God, I'm gonna have to

26:29.536 --> 26:31.893
clear out her apartment.

26:32.623 --> 26:34.350
Does she have any family?

26:34.708 --> 26:39.040
Some, but they were a mess.
She was the one that got away.

26:39.060 --> 26:40.971
Made a life.

26:41.765 --> 26:44.433
And now she's dead.
It's not fair.

26:45.386 --> 26:48.554
For two years, Erika was on
the Unos list for a new heart.

26:48.672 --> 26:52.091
Worked her way to the top
but got so sick, her doctors

26:52.226 --> 26:54.093
put her on a drug trial
to bridge the time 'til

26:54.228 --> 26:58.014
- an organ became available.
- And one never did?

26:59.733 --> 27:03.403
The meds destroyed Erika's
liver...

27:03.520 --> 27:06.189
Made her too weak for
a donor heart,

27:06.323 --> 27:08.721
so she was bumped off the list.

27:09.576 --> 27:12.245
She was basically
waiting to die.

27:12.543 --> 27:15.112
Erika was calm about all of it.

27:15.699 --> 27:17.457
Almost too calm.

27:18.869 --> 27:20.977
It was Mark who freaked out.

27:21.538 --> 27:24.123
He was furious with
the hospital.

27:24.258 --> 27:26.859
Then we start with
the boyfriend.

27:27.428 --> 27:29.655
We always start with
the boyfriend.

27:31.548 --> 27:34.160
How long were you
and Erika together?

27:35.219 --> 27:36.636
I don't know if we were
ever officially together.

27:36.770 --> 27:40.223
We never had the talk.
She wouldn't.

27:40.391 --> 27:42.608
She said then I'd feel
obliged to stick around.

27:42.726 --> 27:46.827
She had no idea how mesmerizing
her brilliant mind was.

27:47.614 --> 27:49.048
How'd you meet?

27:50.220 --> 27:54.409
We worked together.
But we were good friends before that.

27:55.789 --> 27:57.824
- What kind of work?
- Is this 20 questions?

27:57.958 --> 28:01.327
Because I am really not
in the mood to chitchat.

28:01.462 --> 28:03.110
I'm sorry.

28:06.800 --> 28:09.017
She actually wanted to die.

28:09.887 --> 28:13.330
She decided. She accepted it.

28:26.270 --> 28:28.688
Paging Dr. Stayman,
Dr. Stayman, please.

28:30.441 --> 28:32.608
George, I need you
to find out what kind of work

28:32.776 --> 28:36.074
- Nexago Solutions does.
- Hold on.

28:36.947 --> 28:40.057
Erika and Mark design
antivirus software.

28:50.461 --> 28:53.513
Lindy, this isn't

28:53.630 --> 28:55.348
the work of a hacker.
Something incredibly

28:55.466 --> 28:57.517
sophisticated is attacking
the hospital's network.

28:57.634 --> 28:59.685
So this could be
a virus doing this?

29:09.480 --> 29:11.531
It's not just taking down
one machine at a time anymore.

29:11.648 --> 29:13.533
The virus tripped at the exact
time Erika's death was

29:13.650 --> 29:16.736
entered into the system.
And... it's propagating

29:16.870 --> 29:20.214
like a worm throughout
the entire server farm.

29:21.959 --> 29:23.543
- That's not good.
- This virus is bigger than

29:23.660 --> 29:25.378
anything we've ever
dealt with, Lindy.

29:25.496 --> 29:26.996
I think I know the person

29:27.164 --> 29:29.332
who could engineer such
a sophisticated attack.

29:29.466 --> 29:31.911
- Who?
- Mark.

29:35.838 --> 29:37.282
We know you created a virus

29:37.302 --> 29:39.119
that destroyed Erika's
heart machine.

29:39.192 --> 29:40.559
- To kill her?
- No.

29:40.579 --> 29:42.271
- As a mercy death?
- Yes.

29:42.395 --> 29:44.230
- No.
- What are you saying?

29:44.364 --> 29:47.399
I didn't kill Erika.
We designed the virus together,

29:47.534 --> 29:50.069
but... but it
was never supposed to be used.

29:50.237 --> 29:53.560
I probably would have helped her
die if I'd had the courage.

29:54.504 --> 29:57.615
Then who?
Who else would do this?

29:58.578 --> 30:00.134
She was never the victim.

30:00.714 --> 30:02.467
She was the architect.

30:02.799 --> 30:05.636
She killed herself, didn't she?

30:05.656 --> 30:06.669
Yes.

30:06.803 --> 30:09.338
We need to stop this.
People could die.

30:09.472 --> 30:11.423
The whole hospital
is shutting down.

30:11.591 --> 30:13.259
We designed the malware
so that the only way to

30:13.426 --> 30:15.427
terminate its control
is with a kill switch.

30:15.595 --> 30:17.596
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

30:17.731 --> 30:21.350
She would've hard-coded
the firmware onto a tiny device.

30:21.484 --> 30:23.686
- That's how she operated.
- That's what you were

30:23.820 --> 30:26.272
- looking for in her room.
- Yes.

30:26.439 --> 30:28.774
She's been immobile for the past
four days, so it has to be

30:28.909 --> 30:31.493
there, but I've
searched everywhere.

30:32.201 --> 30:34.434
We check the security footage.

30:41.504 --> 30:43.505
You're saying all the earlier
malfunctions, Erika was

30:43.623 --> 30:45.674
beta-testing the malware,
making sure it worked?

30:45.792 --> 30:48.010
- That's some crazy lady.
- She blamed the hospital,

30:48.128 --> 30:49.628
- the doctors.
- Well, how big

30:49.763 --> 30:51.463
- is this kill switch?
- Half-inch at most.

30:51.598 --> 30:53.471
About the size of a dime.

30:56.136 --> 30:58.137
There. On the table.

30:58.271 --> 31:01.023
That's it.
That's the kill switch.

31:01.141 --> 31:02.843
Yep.

31:06.646 --> 31:08.539
She swallowed it.

31:10.817 --> 31:12.535
Uh-oh.

31:39.607 --> 31:42.754
They're not really gonna do
what I think they're gonna do.

31:43.445 --> 31:45.395
- Are they?
- Yeah.

31:48.783 --> 31:50.150
Gross.

31:56.491 --> 31:57.995
We're here.

32:03.214 --> 32:05.999
I know. It's a distinct smell.

32:06.134 --> 32:09.670
- You'll get used to it.
- "So did my soul turn back to

32:09.804 --> 32:15.062
"look again upon the past, which
never had a living person left."

32:15.844 --> 32:17.779
Dante's "inferno."

32:19.180 --> 32:21.589
- Yeager?
- Check those.

32:42.412 --> 32:44.015
Anything?

32:45.039 --> 32:46.472
No.

32:49.511 --> 32:50.989
I found her.

32:55.049 --> 32:57.462
Dr. Wells! Where's Dr. Wells?

33:09.898 --> 33:13.230
- Okay, George, we're ready.
- Okay, so make a simple incision.

33:14.156 --> 33:15.402
What do you mean by simple?

33:15.422 --> 33:17.120
Well, start at the throat
and cut all the way through

33:17.238 --> 33:18.906
the groin. You'll have to clamp

33:19.040 --> 33:20.741
the distal esophagus
so the contents of the stomachs

33:20.875 --> 33:23.577
don't spill out.
See how they're doing it?

33:23.711 --> 33:25.796
And then just remove her whole
organ from her body.

33:25.914 --> 33:28.632
Okay, okay. One step at a time.

33:28.750 --> 33:30.417
The throat to the groin,

33:30.585 --> 33:31.969
- throat to the groin.
- Yeah, you're gonna

33:32.086 --> 33:34.681
want to go around the navel
because it's pretty tough.

33:36.758 --> 33:38.049
Okay.

33:38.893 --> 33:41.428
Would it help if I drew
a line with a sharpie?

33:42.294 --> 33:44.765
Guys, we need that kill switch.

33:44.899 --> 33:47.601
- We're running out of time.
- Okay.

33:47.735 --> 33:51.070
I can do this, I can do this,
I can do this...

33:59.247 --> 34:01.082
Let's do it together.

34:02.951 --> 34:04.408
Yeah.

34:22.725 --> 34:24.963
What are you doing?

34:28.362 --> 34:30.065
We need your help.

34:49.418 --> 34:51.442
That was supposed to work.

34:52.087 --> 34:53.955
Think. What would Erika use

34:54.089 --> 34:56.708
as her authorization code?
She liked creating things.

34:56.875 --> 34:59.711
And this was about revenge.
What was the name of the drug

34:59.845 --> 35:03.502
- that destroyed Erika's liver?
- I don't know.

35:15.110 --> 35:17.174
What are you doing?

35:18.447 --> 35:21.420
Moxopan. It's Moxopan.

35:28.907 --> 35:30.330
It's not working.

35:34.051 --> 35:36.049
_

35:42.888 --> 35:45.807
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

35:48.052 --> 35:50.832
_

35:53.897 --> 35:55.907
_

36:00.311 --> 36:02.631
_

36:51.824 --> 36:53.894
Thank you, Tommy.

36:57.463 --> 36:59.714
You know, I've been meaning
to ask you,

36:59.832 --> 37:01.911
who's the lucky guy?

37:02.557 --> 37:04.836
- Oh, this?
- Yeah.

37:04.970 --> 37:07.004
My grandmother's.
I wear it so patients

37:07.139 --> 37:09.340
don't hit on me.
You wouldn't believe how

37:09.475 --> 37:12.343
- many of them ask me out.
- Popular girl.

37:12.511 --> 37:14.846
Oh, please. Most of them are on

37:14.980 --> 37:18.152
death's door.
What have they got to lose?

37:24.156 --> 37:27.845
She your new partner?
Since... Ben?

37:28.327 --> 37:31.028
No, no, no.
No, she's not my partner.

37:31.163 --> 37:33.081
She's, uh...

37:34.533 --> 37:37.629
What? It's hard to explain.

37:39.538 --> 37:42.530
- I'll give you a call.
- Sure.

37:43.175 --> 37:44.786
Thank you.

37:48.096 --> 37:51.876
So... You get a date out of this
little adventure?

37:51.896 --> 37:53.768
Well, as you said,

37:53.886 --> 37:56.888
a cop and a neurosurgeon,
not exactly a match.

37:57.055 --> 37:59.891
Sure about that?

38:04.062 --> 38:06.095
- Give me a minute.
- Yeah.

38:09.201 --> 38:11.084
Thanks for helping us.

38:14.373 --> 38:17.241
Erika created a perfect
virus, but she never

38:17.409 --> 38:19.627
meant to hurt anyone.

38:19.999 --> 38:22.568
She just became obsessed.

38:24.383 --> 38:27.313
I don't think I understand
that kind of obsession.

38:28.220 --> 38:29.832
I do.

38:30.422 --> 38:32.139
How did you know
Erika's password was the

38:32.257 --> 38:34.883
molecular formula for Moxopan?

38:37.930 --> 38:39.828
A hunch.

38:52.411 --> 38:55.254
You're looking at me
like you didn't want my help.

38:55.664 --> 38:58.282
But you took it, didn't you?

38:59.251 --> 39:01.186
We make a good team, Lindy.

39:01.453 --> 39:05.293
You and I. Don't let me down.

39:05.674 --> 39:09.089
I have such high hopes.
