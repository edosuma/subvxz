WEBVTT

00:09.467 --> 00:10.900
Life--it's literally
all we have.

00:11.000 --> 00:11.900
But is it any good?

00:12.000 --> 00:13.267
I'm a reviewer,

00:13.367 --> 00:14.267
but I don't review

00:14.367 --> 00:15.933
food, books, or movies.

00:16.033 --> 00:18.000
I review life itself.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.600
[screams]

00:19.700 --> 00:21.533
[triumphant music]

00:21.633 --> 00:23.233
[parrot squawks]

00:23.333 --> 00:26.767
*

00:26.867 --> 00:28.067
Over here.

00:28.167 --> 00:32.100
*

00:33.767 --> 00:36.100
Hello, and welcome
to Review.

00:36.200 --> 00:39.167
I'm Forrest MacNeil,
your intrepid lifeonaut

00:39.267 --> 00:41.400
and, at mission control,
as always,

00:41.500 --> 00:42.733
is A.J. Gibbs.

00:42.833 --> 00:45.000
A.J. what adventure awaits?

00:45.100 --> 00:46.533
Me pressing a button.

00:46.633 --> 00:48.700
Right. Yes, but I was
talking about

00:48.800 --> 00:50.267
what adventure awaits me?

00:50.367 --> 00:51.733
Oh, well,
my adventure comes first.

00:51.833 --> 00:53.333
Fine.

00:53.433 --> 00:57.033
Your first review comes from
Vicksburg, Mississippi.

00:57.133 --> 01:00.267
Forrest, our son James recently
came out as a homosexual.

01:00.367 --> 01:03.233
We want to be supportive,
but we just don't understand.

01:03.333 --> 01:04.900
Maybe if we had
a better sense of what

01:05.067 --> 01:06.467
he's thinking and feeling,

01:06.567 --> 01:08.767
we might have a better idea
of how to cure him.

01:08.867 --> 01:11.400
Which is an experience
we both dream of having.

01:11.500 --> 01:14.700
What's it like
to cure a gay person?

01:14.800 --> 01:17.067
Ah-ha. Curing
a gay person

01:17.167 --> 01:20.133
of being a gay person.

01:20.233 --> 01:23.333
Oh, Forrest, you're gonna use
one of your vetoes right?

01:23.433 --> 01:26.400
[dramatic music]

01:26.500 --> 01:29.167
[clears throat]
I am, uh, permitted

01:29.267 --> 01:31.400
to deploy two vetoes
this season,

01:31.500 --> 01:33.533
but it's my job to decide
when to do that

01:33.633 --> 01:35.300
and, uh--

01:35.400 --> 01:39.533
No. No. I do not think
that now is the time. No.

01:39.633 --> 01:42.500
Well, I'm off to, uh...

01:42.600 --> 01:45.067
I'm off
to cure a gay person.

01:45.100 --> 01:46.900
[whimsical music]

01:47.067 --> 01:50.233
(Forrest)
Gay people have existed
since people have existed.

01:50.333 --> 01:53.733
And, yet, in all that time
I have never closely considered

01:53.833 --> 01:57.200
who they are
or why they might need curing.

01:57.300 --> 02:00.467
I chose to begin my review
with a fact-finding mission

02:00.567 --> 02:03.067
to the gay sex shop
nearest my dad's house.

02:03.167 --> 02:05.067
Who is that man?

02:05.167 --> 02:08.300
(Forrest)
While there I was confronted
by a big realization.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.467
- Mystified.
(Forrest) It was so enormous

02:10.567 --> 02:12.967
I suddenly wondered if
this review was even possible

02:13.067 --> 02:15.800
and I knew I had to consult
my producer Grant.

02:15.900 --> 02:18.067
Completely mystifying.

02:18.100 --> 02:20.533
Have you ever
looked closely

02:20.633 --> 02:23.667
at a man's
flaccid penis?

02:23.767 --> 02:25.333
It looks like something
that belongs

02:25.433 --> 02:27.800
on the lightless
ocean floor

02:27.900 --> 02:31.133
and what if, when a gay man
looks at a woman's

02:31.233 --> 02:32.933
beautiful breasts,
he feels the same way.

02:33.067 --> 02:36.300
That they're like
sea blobs with nipples on them.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.533
I mean, if that's what
a gay man sees

02:38.633 --> 02:40.133
when he looks at
a pair of breasts,

02:40.233 --> 02:41.800
how am I supposed
to change that?

02:41.900 --> 02:43.467
- It's impossible.
- Exactly.

02:43.567 --> 02:45.300
What am I supposed to do?

02:45.400 --> 02:49.467
Well, life is a parade of people
doing impossible things.

02:49.567 --> 02:52.300
- Wha--
- Hey, when you quit this show

02:52.400 --> 02:54.433
to go after your ex-wife
and she said it was too late

02:54.533 --> 02:56.433
- and she rejected you...
- Yeah.

02:56.533 --> 02:58.267
You vanished from
the face of the earth

02:58.367 --> 03:01.533
until a dog found you
sleeping in a crawl space

03:01.633 --> 03:03.767
- under a church.
- Yeah, it was a Rottweiler.

03:03.867 --> 03:06.100
But what if I had told you
back then

03:06.200 --> 03:09.067
that in less than a year
you would turn it all around.

03:09.100 --> 03:10.667
You'd have your old job back,

03:10.767 --> 03:12.100
you'd be dating a great
coma nurse.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.967
Oh, well, eh, no,
she and I broke up.

03:14.067 --> 03:15.467
Yeah, well,
that is exactly my point.

03:15.567 --> 03:16.767
Because you don't
need her anymore

03:16.867 --> 03:18.233
because
you're back out there,

03:18.333 --> 03:20.233
you're living
a brand-new life.

03:20.333 --> 03:22.400
So, if you can jump-start
a brand-new life,

03:22.500 --> 03:24.500
why do you think
a gay person can't?

03:24.600 --> 03:28.967
- Hmm.
- Are you so homophobic

03:29.067 --> 03:32.067
that you don't think
a gay man can do what you do

03:32.100 --> 03:34.500
just because he's gay?

03:34.600 --> 03:39.833
No. Definitely gay men
can do everything I can do

03:39.933 --> 03:41.733
and probably a lot better.

03:41.833 --> 03:43.433
- Thank you for that.
- You get out there.

03:43.533 --> 03:45.800
- Yeah.
- All right.

03:45.900 --> 03:48.933
(Forrest)
Grant had given me
a powerful way into this review.

03:49.067 --> 03:51.833
If I can get over my ex-wife,
then a gay person

03:51.933 --> 03:53.800
can surely get over
being gay.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.467
And if a gay person
can't get over being gay,

03:56.567 --> 03:58.967
maybe I can't get over
my ex-wife.

03:59.067 --> 04:01.500
But I can, and I did,

04:01.600 --> 04:03.400
and so can a gay person.

04:03.500 --> 04:06.567
I am a big fan of gays
and the whole gay lifestyle,

04:06.667 --> 04:08.800
but if you're tired of it,
give me a call, all right?

04:08.900 --> 04:10.867
I'll straighten you out.

04:10.967 --> 04:13.433
(Forrest)
I distributed hundreds
of brightly-colored fliers,

04:13.533 --> 04:15.567
but received
just a single response

04:15.667 --> 04:17.933
from a young man
who called himself Tim.

04:18.067 --> 04:22.133
Tim was a gay man who did not
want to be a gay man.

04:22.233 --> 04:26.200
Unlucky for him, but a very
lucky break for this review.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.700
My mom won't talk to me

04:27.800 --> 04:29.300
and my dad thinks
I'm going to hell.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.900
You know, it gets me
wondering that maybe

04:32.067 --> 04:35.233
God made me so depressed
to punish me.

04:35.333 --> 04:36.867
You know, Tim,
I was once like you.

04:36.967 --> 04:38.533
I knew it. I knew it.

04:38.633 --> 04:41.067
Oh, no, no.
I was never a homosexual.

04:41.167 --> 04:43.967
Nor was I ever attracted
to men sexually.

04:44.067 --> 04:46.100
But I was once
attracted to someone

04:46.200 --> 04:48.133
that I should not
have been attracted to.

04:48.233 --> 04:51.367
I'm talking about
my ex-wife, Suzanne.

04:51.467 --> 04:54.300
And I was able to overcome
my love for her,

04:54.400 --> 04:57.133
you, Tim,
will be able to overcome

04:57.233 --> 04:58.867
your unwanted love, too,

04:58.967 --> 05:00.200
but you have to be
willing to do it.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.167
- Are you willing to do it?
- Yes.

05:02.267 --> 05:04.467
- Are you willing to work hard?
- Yes, I'll work hard.

05:04.567 --> 05:06.133
Do you believe that we
can do this together?

05:06.233 --> 05:08.067
Yes, I believe you,
Forrest.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.167
Okay.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.100
How?

05:13.200 --> 05:14.600
How what?

05:14.700 --> 05:16.533
(Forrest)
I, of course, had no idea,

05:16.633 --> 05:18.833
but I did know that
learning to un-love Suzanne

05:18.933 --> 05:20.400
had been traumatic.

05:20.500 --> 05:23.200
To spare Tim the same fate
I turned to an expert

05:23.300 --> 05:25.067
who definitely knew
what he was doing

05:25.167 --> 05:27.267
because he was once
a gay man himself.

05:27.367 --> 05:29.933
- I was a gay man myself once.
(Forrest) Oh, okay.

05:30.067 --> 05:32.733
(Dr. Arnold)
The disease of
homosexuality is rooted

05:32.833 --> 05:34.200
in the lack of masculine
affection

05:34.300 --> 05:35.700
in a young man's life.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.200
As a therapist,
you must offer that affection

05:38.300 --> 05:40.900
in order to make his
homosexuality go away.

05:41.067 --> 05:43.867
Just as my loving therapist
did for me.

05:43.967 --> 05:45.600
Dashing man.

05:45.700 --> 05:47.600
Yeah.
Well, how did he do that?

05:47.700 --> 05:50.100
(Forrest)
The technique
was called Holding.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.767
And while it may not be
supported by traditional
science,

05:52.867 --> 05:55.067
it was Dr. Arnold's
signature move.

05:55.167 --> 05:59.067
The idea was that by
seating himself on my
fully-clothed lap,

05:59.167 --> 06:01.667
Tim would lose the desire
to sit on another man's

06:01.767 --> 06:03.667
less fully-clothed lap.

06:03.767 --> 06:06.667
[whimsical music]

06:06.767 --> 06:08.100
*

06:08.200 --> 06:10.733
So, how you feeling?

06:10.833 --> 06:14.333
Um, just maybe wanted
to talk to you about cologne.

06:14.433 --> 06:17.667
Try to stay focused, Tim.
Just open your mind

06:17.767 --> 06:20.233
and tell me how you feel.

06:20.333 --> 06:22.700
Just maybe thinking about
cologne and mouthwash.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.667
Shh.

06:24.767 --> 06:26.967
[alarm beeps]
- Oh, ah!

06:27.067 --> 06:29.233
Okay, that's an hour.
[laughs]

06:29.333 --> 06:32.500
(Forrest)
Holding, while
cumbersome at first,

06:32.600 --> 06:36.500
soon became an accepted part
of life at my dad's house.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.067
*

06:38.100 --> 06:40.300
After five days
with Tim on my lap,

06:40.400 --> 06:42.567
I decided it was
time to put my subject,

06:42.667 --> 06:46.067
and Dr. Arnold's technique,
to the test.

06:46.167 --> 06:50.200
Tell me, please,
what this makes you feel.

06:50.300 --> 06:53.533
Oh, it makes me feel...

06:53.633 --> 06:56.200
very attracted to that man.
[groans]

06:56.300 --> 06:58.300
(Forrest)
The power of
unwanted love is strong.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.633
- Wow.
(Forrest) As I myself understood

07:00.733 --> 07:03.533
all too well we would need
to try harder.

07:03.633 --> 07:05.267
Put that down.

07:05.367 --> 07:08.867
I don't think it's gonna be
helpful to look at that.

07:08.967 --> 07:10.067
So if the hugging
doesn't work,

07:10.133 --> 07:11.600
I mean,
is there something else?

07:11.700 --> 07:13.300
I mean, there's gotta be
something else, right?

07:13.400 --> 07:14.333
- He's a tough nut.
- Really tough. Really tough.

07:14.433 --> 07:15.800
Here's what I recommend.

07:15.900 --> 07:17.333
Okay, this is called
syrup of ipecac

07:17.433 --> 07:19.267
and it's gonna make you
feel very, very nauseous.

07:19.367 --> 07:21.100
(Forrest)
Dr. Arnold had
a lot more ideas

07:21.200 --> 07:22.700
for turning
a gay man straight.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.633
You're going to
associate naked men

07:24.733 --> 07:26.833
and their penises
with this feeling.

07:26.933 --> 07:28.367
(Forrest)
Some of them were disgusting.

07:28.467 --> 07:30.167
- [retching]
- He is making you feel sick.

07:30.267 --> 07:31.767
- You made me sick.
- No, I didn't make you sick.

07:31.867 --> 07:34.367
- He did by being so sexy.
- You made me sick.

07:34.467 --> 07:36.067
(Forrest)
Others were
surprisingly athletic.

07:36.100 --> 07:37.800
- Get the anger out.
- Oh, God.

07:37.900 --> 07:39.933
The bed is Satan.
Satan made you gay.

07:40.067 --> 07:42.567
Why'd you make me gay,
stupid bastard?

07:42.667 --> 07:44.233
- Okay, okay.
- [screams]

07:44.333 --> 07:47.067
Oh, Tim, sorry, this is my bed.
I do have to sleep here.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.733
(Forrest)
But the results
were always the same.

07:48.833 --> 07:51.367
- You feel any less gay?
- [sighs]

07:51.467 --> 07:53.500
No. No.

07:53.600 --> 07:56.267
(Forrest)
I began to fear that I would
spend the rest of my life

07:56.367 --> 07:58.733
trying to fulfill
this one review.

07:58.833 --> 08:01.900
It was time to try
my own ideas.

08:02.067 --> 08:03.400
[techno music]

08:03.500 --> 08:05.600
I needed to offer Tim
a good alternative

08:05.700 --> 08:07.233
to homosexuality.

08:07.333 --> 08:09.433
I chose heterosexuality

08:09.533 --> 08:12.167
and introduced him
to the allure of women.

08:12.267 --> 08:15.100
*

08:15.200 --> 08:17.100
I'm sorry, I just need
like a little space here.

08:17.200 --> 08:18.900
Forrest, I don't think
I can do this. Okay?

08:19.067 --> 08:21.567
Just focus on the pleasurable
aspects of it.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.467
- What's pleasurable about it?
- I just feel bad.

08:23.567 --> 08:25.500
- Do you want to change, or not?
- Yeah, I wanna change.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.300
- You do wanna change?
- I wanna change, I'm trying.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.633
Listen, I'm just gonna wait--
He doesn't want it.

08:28.733 --> 08:29.667
Don't go anywhere.
Don't go anywhere.

08:29.767 --> 08:31.667
It may seem impossible
to you,

08:31.767 --> 08:33.467
but the impossible
is possible.

08:33.567 --> 08:35.067
I got over my ex-wife,

08:35.167 --> 08:36.767
you can get over
your ex-sex.

08:36.867 --> 08:39.100
- You gotta believe that.
- Well, you talk about her--

08:39.200 --> 08:41.300
- You can do it. Okay?
- Okay, I'll--I'll--

08:41.400 --> 08:42.567
- Okay.
- I need to get a drink, though.

08:42.667 --> 08:44.233
- All right?
- That's fine.

08:44.333 --> 08:45.300
(woman) Yeah, yeah.
- Yes, I would love a drink.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.567
If they have a Pinot Grigio

08:47.667 --> 08:49.133
- that looks good...
- Okay...

08:49.233 --> 08:51.667
You paid for the dance,
do you want the rest?

08:51.767 --> 08:53.700
- I didn't catch your name.
- Shampoo.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.167
Shampoo.
Hi, Shampoo.

08:55.267 --> 08:56.400
- 'Cause you're dirty.
- Ooh.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.800
And you need to be cleaned.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.400
(Forrest)
Our evening was going very well

08:59.500 --> 09:00.967
and it was time
to take things

09:01.067 --> 09:03.267
to the next
logical heterosexual step.

09:03.367 --> 09:04.733
I don't want to be
too forward,

09:04.833 --> 09:06.933
but, uh, maybe...

09:07.067 --> 09:09.267
- after you get off work...
- Yeah?

09:09.367 --> 09:11.367
You and one of your colleagues
might like to join

09:11.467 --> 09:13.567
my friend and myself
for a drink.

09:13.667 --> 09:15.067
[laughter]

09:15.133 --> 09:17.467
Well, we are hanging out
with some pretty, gorgeous

09:17.567 --> 09:20.067
ladies in my opinion.
Wouldn't you agree?

09:20.133 --> 09:21.467
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

09:21.567 --> 09:23.967
So much more attractive
than men. Both of you are.

09:24.067 --> 09:25.633
I cannot believe that
you are both single.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.533
- That's incredible to me.
- Well, my boyfriend

09:27.633 --> 09:29.367
just broke up with me
'cause he can't handle

09:29.467 --> 09:31.600
- what I do for a living.
- Are you kidding me?

09:31.700 --> 09:34.067
You know, my wife left me
for the exact same reason.

09:34.167 --> 09:35.633
You and I have
a lot in common.

09:35.733 --> 09:37.233
- We really do.
- We do.

09:37.333 --> 09:38.700
But we don't have too much
in common, Tim.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.100
Tim. She and I don't
have too much in common.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.100
- You know what I'm saying?
- Uh, yeah.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.733
We have different genitals.

09:44.833 --> 09:46.067
(Forrest)
Distracted as I was

09:46.167 --> 09:48.133
by Shampoo's beguiling charms

09:48.233 --> 09:50.800
I did not notice
that Tim had snuck off

09:50.900 --> 09:53.600
with Trinity.
A troubling development.

09:53.700 --> 09:55.600
The patient
was out of my care.

09:55.700 --> 09:58.233
Hey, where did they go?
Where did they go?

09:58.333 --> 10:02.067
(Forrest)
I would not find out until
our meeting the following day.

10:02.167 --> 10:05.133
Hi. Tim, what happened
to you last night?

10:05.233 --> 10:06.967
I turn around and you
and Trinity were gone.

10:07.067 --> 10:08.733
I'm texting you all night long.
You didn't get back to me.

10:08.833 --> 10:10.567
- [stammers]
- Oh, well, Trinity

10:10.667 --> 10:12.267
took me out to this bar
called Dick Town

10:12.367 --> 10:14.100
and we talked
for a long time.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.400
You and Trinity went out
to a bar?

10:15.500 --> 10:17.200
Yeah, we did.
Called Dick Town.

10:17.300 --> 10:19.533
- Okay.
- And, uh, a guy came over

10:19.633 --> 10:22.300
and, uh, his name
was Pete.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.600
Uh-huh. Then what?

10:24.700 --> 10:26.067
We just stayed there
the whole night.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.533
Danced, and, oh, my God.
Burned the place down.

10:28.633 --> 10:30.933
- [laughs]
- Anything else go on?

10:32.367 --> 10:34.967
Uh, yeah, I don't know
how to put this,

10:35.067 --> 10:36.933
but I feel like I had
a breakthrough last night.

10:37.033 --> 10:39.767
(Forrest, voice over)
I could not have been
happier for Tim.

10:39.867 --> 10:43.600
It was very clear to me
that he and Trinity the stripper

10:43.700 --> 10:46.133
had fallen in hetero love.

10:46.233 --> 10:48.033
So let me ask you this...

10:48.133 --> 10:51.800
Do you still feel haunted
by any homosexual urges?

10:54.233 --> 10:55.633
Haunted...I--

10:55.733 --> 10:57.600
I would say I am--
I'm not.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.133
I'm not haunted anymore.
I feel great. Really.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.833
I did it.
[laughs]

11:03.933 --> 11:06.100
- I really did it.
- Uh, what?

11:06.200 --> 11:07.600
I cured you.

11:07.700 --> 11:09.233
I--

11:09.333 --> 11:11.100
And they said
it was impossible.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.267
Well, good luck
getting over your ex-wife.

11:13.367 --> 11:14.900
That's super hard
I know, so...

11:15.067 --> 11:16.233
Nope, I already did that,
but thank you.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.067
Oh, and speaking of which,
you know, maybe

11:18.167 --> 11:20.567
one of these days you, me,
and Shampoo, and Trinity

11:20.667 --> 11:21.767
should all go out
on a double date.

11:21.867 --> 11:23.400
Pete, too.
[chuckles]

11:23.500 --> 11:27.167
- Who's Pete?
- Pete? The guy I met yesterday.

11:27.267 --> 11:28.267
He's really sweet,
super-understanding.

11:28.367 --> 11:29.500
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, my God.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.200
- Yeah.
- I thank you so much.

11:31.300 --> 11:33.433
I really appreciate it.
I'm gonna head out, okay?

11:33.533 --> 11:34.700
- Okay, great.
- Yeah.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.333
- Enjoy your new life.
- I will.

11:36.433 --> 11:38.167
(Forrest, voice-over)
In the end, curing a gay person

11:38.267 --> 11:41.567
was indeed every bit as possible
as getting over my ex-wife.

11:41.667 --> 11:44.333
It's about something good
happened to you.

11:44.433 --> 11:46.267
- This is on the house.
- [chuckles]

11:46.367 --> 11:48.767
- What is it?
- Coconut cream pie.

11:48.867 --> 11:51.267
(Forrest, voice-over)
And who can really say
that either thing was wrong

11:51.367 --> 11:55.167
when Tim and I are clearly
so very happy?

11:55.267 --> 11:57.333
To be clear,
I have no problem

11:57.433 --> 11:59.233
with anyone's
sexual orientation.

11:59.333 --> 12:01.967
What I do have a problem with,
is giving up.

12:02.067 --> 12:04.067
I don't care whether
you're gay or straight,

12:04.100 --> 12:05.800
if you're sick of it,
change it.

12:05.900 --> 12:09.367
It was inspiring to help Tim
find a way to love someone new

12:09.467 --> 12:11.367
and I am happy to say
that in the process,

12:11.467 --> 12:13.967
I found someone special
myself. Shampoo.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.300
We are now a couple.
[laughs]

12:16.400 --> 12:19.867
So I give curing a gay
two beautiful stars

12:19.967 --> 12:21.167
who belong together.

12:23.967 --> 12:27.233
The next request comes from
Jerry in Portland, Maine.

12:27.333 --> 12:29.200
- Mm-hmm.
- Jerry writes:

12:34.633 --> 12:36.800
Oh, my goodness.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.500
The Mile High Club.
Well, I know what that is.

12:38.600 --> 12:41.400
- Oh, my yes.
- I'm off to have sex

12:41.500 --> 12:42.867
on an airplane.

12:42.967 --> 12:44.800
Gee, wiz.

12:44.900 --> 12:46.267
Oh, boy.

12:47.867 --> 12:49.767
You're one of those guys
that carries a condom

12:49.867 --> 12:51.400
wherever you go, huh?

12:51.500 --> 12:57.067
Ugh.

12:57.133 --> 12:58.633
(Forrest, voice-over]
I have been flying to
San Francisco monthly

12:58.733 --> 13:00.900
to pick up my son Eric
for our weekends together.

13:01.067 --> 13:02.600
It seemed natural
that I would invite

13:02.700 --> 13:05.700
my new lady-friend Shampoo
to join me on my next trip

13:05.800 --> 13:10.300
and voila: membership
in the Mile High Club.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.400
I'm really excited
to meet your son.

13:15.500 --> 13:16.933
Yeah.

13:17.067 --> 13:19.067
- I really like kids.
- Mmm.

13:19.100 --> 13:21.100
Hey, look...

13:21.200 --> 13:25.900
now that we are...
one mile up in the air,

13:26.067 --> 13:28.733
do you want to, uh...
[clicks tongue]

13:28.833 --> 13:30.933
- [laughs]
- What?

13:31.067 --> 13:34.067
[whispers] Let's go have sex
in the bathroom.

13:34.167 --> 13:35.900
[whispers] I'm not gonna
have sex in the bathroom.

13:36.067 --> 13:37.733
- Why not?
- It's gross.

13:37.833 --> 13:40.067
- What's gross about it?
- People are [bleep] in there.

13:40.100 --> 13:41.767
Oh, come on.
This is a short flight,

13:41.867 --> 13:44.067
I don't think anybody is
pooping on the way

13:44.100 --> 13:46.133
up to San Francisco.

13:46.233 --> 13:49.067
- Come on.
- Is that why you invited me?

13:49.100 --> 13:52.067
- No.
- Because I'm a stripper...

13:52.167 --> 13:54.500
So I'd be up for that?
Right?

13:54.600 --> 13:57.900
- No.
- Gross.

13:58.067 --> 13:59.567
Everybody on this plane
likes to have sex.

13:59.667 --> 14:02.233
(Shampoo)
You know what?
If it was all about sex for me,

14:02.333 --> 14:05.100
I would have found somebody
a lot hotter!

14:09.400 --> 14:13.367
That is one of
the rudest things

14:13.467 --> 14:14.633
that anyone
has ever said to me.

14:14.733 --> 14:17.100
[scoffs]

14:17.200 --> 14:18.433
[crying]
I thought you were different.

14:18.533 --> 14:21.433
I thought maybe for once
I met a nice guy.

14:23.167 --> 14:25.267
I'm gonna give you
some space.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.600
(Forrest, voice-over)
Rather than turned
on by the idea of sex

14:29.700 --> 14:31.533
in an airplane bathroom,
Shampoo--

14:31.633 --> 14:35.267
a professional clothes remover,
seemed stunned.

14:35.367 --> 14:37.767
My trip to the Mile High Club
with her was,

14:37.867 --> 14:41.067
as they say in the travel
business, cancelled.

14:41.133 --> 14:43.300
I would need to find someone
on this flight

14:43.400 --> 14:45.433
more sexually adventurous
than a stripper.

14:47.233 --> 14:49.333
And just when
all seemed lost...

14:53.400 --> 14:56.600
Uh, excuse me. Sorry.
Sorry to bother you.

14:56.700 --> 14:58.733
Can I switch seats with you
by any chance?

14:58.833 --> 15:00.633
(man) What?
- I'm in 23D.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.433
Just right up there.
Thank you very--ah, thank you.

15:02.533 --> 15:03.800
- Yeah, that's great.
- Ass[bleep].

15:03.900 --> 15:06.600
Thank you so much.
It is middle seat.

15:06.700 --> 15:08.700
(Forrest, voice-over)
After pouring out every ounce

15:08.800 --> 15:11.333
of available charm
on to this woman Beth,

15:11.433 --> 15:13.933
I was clearly,
incredibly enough,

15:14.067 --> 15:16.433
being considered
for admission into the club.

15:16.533 --> 15:18.067
- Yes, exactly.
- [laughs]

15:18.100 --> 15:19.767
You can go into space
without being an astronaut.

15:19.867 --> 15:21.433
(Captain)
We have begun
our initial descent

15:21.533 --> 15:23.367
into San Francisco
International Airport.

15:23.467 --> 15:25.100
Please return to your seats
and make sure

15:25.200 --> 15:27.733
your seatbelts
are securely fastened.

15:27.833 --> 15:29.833
Hey, Beth...

15:29.933 --> 15:32.833
This is gonna sound crazy.

15:32.933 --> 15:35.667
[whispers] I wanna have
sex with you right now.

15:35.767 --> 15:38.600
[laughs]

15:38.700 --> 15:41.067
- Right now?
- Yeah, right now.

15:41.100 --> 15:42.733
Let's just follow
this moment.

15:42.833 --> 15:45.700
Did you feel it?

15:45.800 --> 15:49.100
- Yeah, I did.
- I knew it.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.333
Okay, so, will you
sneak to the bathroom

15:51.433 --> 15:52.667
with me right now
and have sex?

15:52.767 --> 15:55.233
- So, we gonna [bleep]?
- Yeah.

15:55.333 --> 15:56.667
[pings]

15:56.767 --> 15:58.100
It's just
the seatbelt light's on.

15:58.200 --> 16:01.267
- Yeah, so?
- When we get to the airport

16:01.367 --> 16:03.600
take a cab
to the closest hotel.

16:03.700 --> 16:05.167
Listen, I can't wait
that long.

16:05.267 --> 16:07.167
Okay, we'll find a place
in the airport.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.900
No, I can't wait
that long, either.

16:09.067 --> 16:10.967
- No, seriously...
- No, it's super dangerous.

16:11.067 --> 16:13.167
No, it's not
that dangerous.

16:13.267 --> 16:14.900
(Forrest, voice-over)
Beth could obviously disregard

16:15.067 --> 16:17.633
many of societies
guidelines for how to behave,

16:17.733 --> 16:19.900
but not, for some reason,
the seatbelt sign.

16:20.067 --> 16:21.367
I don't wanna do it
in an airport bathroom.

16:21.467 --> 16:23.500
I wanna do it
in an airplane bathroom.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.133
- Seriously.
- Yeah, but the seatbelt sign

16:25.233 --> 16:26.700
- is on--
- Who cares about the sign?

16:26.800 --> 16:28.733
- Seriously?
- Let's go to a nice hotel.

16:28.833 --> 16:30.867
No, thank you.

16:30.967 --> 16:32.833
Oh, my God.

16:34.067 --> 16:35.467
Oh, hey, what about
another flight?

16:35.567 --> 16:38.333
No, don't touch me!
Okay?

16:38.433 --> 16:40.367
(Forrest, voice-over)
My failure to join
the Mile High Club

16:40.467 --> 16:43.067
was dispiriting,
but I eager to try again

16:43.167 --> 16:44.967
on that afternoon's
return trip.

16:45.067 --> 16:47.333
First, I'd need to pick up
my traveling companion

16:47.433 --> 16:49.067
my 12-year-old son Eric.

16:49.167 --> 16:50.633
- Why hello.
- Hi, Forrest.

16:50.733 --> 16:52.367
- How are you?
- I'm good. I'm good.

16:52.467 --> 16:53.633
- Good, good.
- Are you fe--

16:53.733 --> 16:55.800
- you feeling better and...
- Yeah.

16:55.900 --> 16:57.367
You know, they got
all the bullets out.

16:57.467 --> 16:59.233
- That's good.
- Uh, yeah.

16:59.333 --> 17:01.067
Oh, Suzanne,
this is Shampoo.

17:01.167 --> 17:02.600
Shampoo, Suzanne.

17:02.700 --> 17:03.933
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

17:04.067 --> 17:05.700
Yes,
this is my girlfriend.

17:05.800 --> 17:08.133
- Oh.
- Ex-girlfriend.

17:08.233 --> 17:11.333
Okay. Are you sure
that it's okay for me

17:11.433 --> 17:13.600
to send Eric with you guys?

17:13.700 --> 17:15.600
Yeah.
What do you mean?

17:15.700 --> 17:17.600
Uh, just, you know,
you're required to have

17:17.700 --> 17:19.867
a safe and stable
environment,

17:19.967 --> 17:21.767
- so I didn't know if--
- That's what I have.

17:21.867 --> 17:22.967
- A safe and stable environment.
- What you and Shampoo

17:23.067 --> 17:24.333
had cooked up
for the weekend.

17:24.433 --> 17:26.133
Please bring him out here.
Eric and I,

17:26.233 --> 17:27.967
and possibly Shampoo, are gonna
have a wonderful weekend

17:28.067 --> 17:29.633
- together.
- Eric, come on down.

17:29.733 --> 17:30.933
Your dad's here.

17:31.067 --> 17:32.133
What do you mean
my ex-girlfriend?

17:32.233 --> 17:33.267
What's that about?

17:33.367 --> 17:35.133
- Hey, hey. There he is.
- Hey.

17:35.233 --> 17:36.800
How's it going?
Nice to see you.

17:36.900 --> 17:38.867
Okay, well, uh,
text me, honey.

17:38.967 --> 17:41.667
It will not be necessary
for any texting to occur.

17:41.767 --> 17:43.867
I'm taking away your texter.
All right, good.

17:43.967 --> 17:44.867
Are you going
to introduce me?

17:44.967 --> 17:46.167
What? Oh, sorry.

17:46.267 --> 17:47.867
Uh, Eric,
this is Shampoo.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.700
- Hi.
- Hey.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.800
(Forrest)
Status unclear.

17:55.733 --> 17:57.633
You guys are not
boyfriend, girlfriend?

17:57.733 --> 18:00.400
We were, but on the flight
up here your dad

18:00.500 --> 18:02.067
sent some
weirdo to sit with me,

18:02.167 --> 18:03.533
so he could pick up
another woman.

18:03.633 --> 18:05.767
Okay, that's enough
gossip, please. Thank you.

18:05.867 --> 18:07.800
(Forrest, voice-over)
Shampoo and I had apparently
broken up,

18:07.900 --> 18:09.800
but I still had
a job to do.

18:09.900 --> 18:12.067
I had to find someone
who I was certain

18:12.133 --> 18:14.067
would not
reject my advances.

18:14.133 --> 18:16.200
Oh, I see an old friend.
I'm just gonna pull over here

18:16.300 --> 18:17.767
real quick and, uh,

18:17.867 --> 18:20.100
say hello to an old friend.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.767
I'll be right back.

18:23.867 --> 18:26.600
- Oh, hi, there.
- Hi, baby.

18:26.700 --> 18:28.600
What's he doing?

18:28.700 --> 18:31.433
Looks like your dad
is picking up a street whore.

18:31.533 --> 18:34.967
I've been a prostitute
for eight years.

18:35.067 --> 18:36.467
- Eight years?
- Mm-hmm.

18:36.567 --> 18:39.267
- I guess you love your work.
- Yeah, baby.

18:39.367 --> 18:41.800
I am definitely looking
forward to this.

18:41.900 --> 18:43.533
- Oh, you're gonna love it.
- Yeah.

18:43.633 --> 18:45.267
(Forrest, voice-over)
My Mile High Club membership

18:45.367 --> 18:47.300
- was finally on track.
- [pings]

18:47.400 --> 18:49.633
(woman)
The captain has turned off
the fasten seatbelt sign.

18:49.733 --> 18:52.933
(Forrest, voice-over)
But then I hit some bizarre
and unexpected turbulence.

18:53.067 --> 18:56.100
- How much is he paying you?
- $200 plus the ticket.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.267
I'll give you $300
if I can go first.

18:58.367 --> 19:00.200
Oh, sorry, excuse me.
Just mind your own business.

19:00.300 --> 19:02.300
- Thank you.
- Uh, sold.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.600
(Forrest, voice-over)
Incredibly enough I had
stumbled onto a flight

19:04.700 --> 19:07.767
full of recovering sex addicts
on an immersion therapy trip

19:07.867 --> 19:10.500
- to a Tijuana brothel.
- $350 if I get to go first.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.200
- Yup, come on.
- What?

19:12.300 --> 19:16.067
$400 plus 10,000
frequent flier miles.

19:16.100 --> 19:18.433
(Forrest, voice-over)
And the line for immersion
was long.

19:18.533 --> 19:21.167
Take note,
this is apparently

19:21.267 --> 19:22.833
one of the things
that can happen

19:22.933 --> 19:25.200
when you are so determined
to have sex on an airplane

19:25.300 --> 19:28.067
then you hire a prostitute
to travel with you.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.833
This extraordinary,
and horrifying, development

19:30.933 --> 19:33.600
led to a truly disgusting
turn of events.

19:33.700 --> 19:36.267
Though my prostitute,
Margaret, did earn enough money

19:36.367 --> 19:38.167
to self-publish
her book of poetry.

19:38.267 --> 19:40.867
- Finally.
- [pings]

19:40.967 --> 19:43.067
(man)
The captain has turned on
the fasten seatbelt sign.

19:43.167 --> 19:44.333
(Forrest)
What are you doing?

19:44.433 --> 19:46.400
- We gotta sit down.
- What? Why?

19:46.500 --> 19:48.700
You can't be standing
when the seatbelt light is on.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.100
No, no, no, no.
You gotta be kidding me.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.833
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

19:51.933 --> 19:53.433
This is gonna take, like,
one or two minutes. Please.

19:53.533 --> 19:55.833
- We gotta go back there.
- No. No.

19:55.933 --> 19:57.433
I have to join
the Mile High Club right now.

19:57.533 --> 20:00.533
Well, okay, but I have
to have my seatbelt on.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.000
It's okay.
Listen, here.

20:03.100 --> 20:05.367
Put the little blanket on.

20:05.467 --> 20:06.933
And do it right here
in the seat?

20:07.033 --> 20:08.933
- Yeah.
(man) Flight Attendants will be

20:09.033 --> 20:10.667
coming through the cabin
to collect any remaining

20:10.767 --> 20:13.067
- service items.
- Uh, you better hurry.

20:13.167 --> 20:14.267
Yeah, okay, fine.

20:14.367 --> 20:17.367
[metal jingles, zipper unzips]

20:17.467 --> 20:19.900
(Forrest, voice-over)
I was, eventually,
allowed entry

20:20.000 --> 20:22.233
into the Mile High Club,
but so what?

20:22.333 --> 20:24.900
As it turned out
any idiot was free to join.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.100
I learned that I prefer
my sexual encounters

20:27.200 --> 20:30.067
to be both free
and free of spectators.

20:30.167 --> 20:31.700
[sighs]

20:31.800 --> 20:33.267
[cries]

20:33.367 --> 20:36.200
I also learned the only belt
I want to unbuckle

20:36.300 --> 20:38.267
to have sex
is my pant's belt.

20:38.367 --> 20:41.567
And, perhaps also,
my heart's belt.

20:41.667 --> 20:44.000
No matter how scary
the turbulence.

20:44.100 --> 20:47.200
Joining the Mile High Club,
three stars.

20:49.400 --> 20:50.500
I can't believe
it didn't work out

20:50.600 --> 20:52.167
between you and shampoo.

20:52.267 --> 20:54.833
I mean, you treated her
horribly,

20:54.933 --> 20:57.100
but who knew she'd have
so much self-respect?

20:59.433 --> 21:01.833
There was no way
of editing that...

21:01.933 --> 21:03.833
that didn't make it
seem horrifying.

21:03.933 --> 21:05.067
- That's really gross.
- Yeah.

21:06.067 --> 21:08.167
[triumphant music]
