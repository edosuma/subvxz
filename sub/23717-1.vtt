00:22.147 --> 00:25.233
SEOK CHO (28)
ASPIRING WEBTOON ARTIST

00:26.276 --> 00:27.819
I'm not good at anything.

00:27.944 --> 00:29.029
I never have been.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.697
Naturally, I got bad grades in school.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.158
GRADE 11 MIDTERM RANKING

00:34.117 --> 00:35.535
395 - SEOK CHO

00:35.660 --> 00:37.162
You're the lowest!

00:37.287 --> 00:39.622
You're really something.
Aren't you even embarrassed?

00:39.748 --> 00:40.999
Hey, watch your tongue!

00:41.124 --> 00:43.293
There were some people
who didn't see it as a problem.

00:43.418 --> 00:46.045
Personality is more important
than appearance.

00:46.171 --> 00:47.797
Don't make fun of his looks.

00:47.922 --> 00:50.216
He has to live like this
for the rest of his life!

00:50.341 --> 00:51.551
Something else mattered to them.

00:54.345 --> 00:55.930
I tried my best to be good at sports.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.974
We must win, no matter what!

01:03.897 --> 01:05.899
Oh, no! We're losing.

01:07.650 --> 01:11.071
-What the hell?
-Pull, pull!

01:12.655 --> 01:14.032
We won!

01:22.373 --> 01:25.293
That day, I realized you have
more places to be hit when you're tall.

01:30.548 --> 01:33.009
Needless to say,
I've never had a girlfriend.

01:41.392 --> 01:44.604
I've often seen you at this library.
Will you go out with me?

01:46.815 --> 01:49.359
Excuse me. Could you give me
an answer to this?

01:56.825 --> 01:59.661
I've often seen you at this library.
Will you go out with me?

01:59.786 --> 02:01.663
THE NEXT DAY

02:06.709 --> 02:10.380
Can you give me your answer
to the note I gave you yesterday?

02:11.548 --> 02:12.590
Sure.

02:14.050 --> 02:15.301
Eighteen.

02:15.927 --> 02:18.429
What? Eighteen?

02:21.641 --> 02:23.393
There must be some misunderstanding.

02:24.435 --> 02:27.021
I asked you... to go out with me.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.523
Yeah, I saw it.

02:29.107 --> 02:30.275
That's my answer.

02:39.367 --> 02:40.535
Anyway, that's me.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.996
Seok! Seok!

02:44.080 --> 02:45.331
Do me a favor.

02:45.456 --> 02:47.584
-Get me some soy sauce and--
-Mom!

02:47.709 --> 02:49.836
-Do I look like I'm not doing anything?
-Yeah.

02:52.046 --> 02:55.049
USELESS COMPUTER,
USELESS PICTURES, USELESS SON

02:56.551 --> 02:57.594
I'm really busy.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.220
-I have to go.
-Where?

03:00.388 --> 03:01.639
Where are you going?

03:06.644 --> 03:10.273
I may not have been good at anything,
but the world has changed.

03:10.398 --> 03:13.610
All I need is one great skill.
That's how the world works now.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.614
Like this cartoon I drew.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.995
You call this a cartoon? Do you even know
how the world is nowadays?

03:24.120 --> 03:26.497
I mean, what have you drawn here?

03:26.623 --> 03:28.458
-What's your name?
-I'm Seok Cho.

03:29.167 --> 03:32.378
Whatever. You can't just walk in here
with this crap.

03:32.503 --> 03:35.089
And why did you choose
historical stuff for a webtoon?

03:35.924 --> 03:37.217
It's about Prince Sado.

03:38.927 --> 03:41.221
If this is wrong, what should I draw?

03:41.346 --> 03:43.932
First, you must reflect the latest trend.

03:44.057 --> 03:47.518
Take a look at popular webtoons,
like  Cheese in the Trap.

03:47.644 --> 03:48.895
That was made into a TV show.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.606
Even if it's historical,
try going in that direction...

03:51.731 --> 03:57.987
-Like, "Sado in the Rice Chest."
-What?

03:58.112 --> 04:00.990
This sounds good.
This sounds terrific!

04:01.115 --> 04:04.035
A historical romantic thriller,
Sado in the Rice Chest!

04:06.663 --> 04:07.789
One spring day,

04:08.373 --> 04:10.458
a new royal servant, Seol, meets...

04:11.084 --> 04:12.710
Prince Sado!

04:17.715 --> 04:20.218
However, Sado has an unspeakable secret.

04:20.343 --> 04:21.427
Prince Sado?

04:22.387 --> 04:24.264
He has seven personalities.

04:26.516 --> 04:29.852
Remember this. March 2nd,
in the 29th year of King Yeong-jo, 2 p.m.,

04:29.978 --> 04:31.896
the moment I fell in love with you.

04:32.563 --> 04:35.566
Adding to that, Sado's private life
has been a problem in the palace.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.361
I expected a prince to be different.

04:42.156 --> 04:44.409
Is that different enough?

04:45.952 --> 04:46.953
I'm so sorry...

04:47.078 --> 04:49.706
for not being different.

04:50.498 --> 04:52.750
Ultimately, the king decides
to lock Sado up in the rice chest,

04:52.875 --> 04:55.628
but Sado figures out the king's intention
and runs away.

04:55.753 --> 04:56.713
So, the chase begins.

04:57.463 --> 04:58.423
Faster!

05:08.766 --> 05:10.852
You're telling me...
to draw something like that?

05:10.977 --> 05:13.313
That'd be way better than this!

05:15.315 --> 05:16.316
-Hey!
-Yes?

05:16.441 --> 05:17.400
Mr. Cho!

05:18.443 --> 05:19.861
Come take a look at this.

05:20.486 --> 05:22.989
Wow, he has no drawing skills at all.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.492
Why does this man have
a hexagon for a face?

05:26.617 --> 05:28.161
That's what I mean.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.455
What's more, this is historical stuff!

05:30.580 --> 05:31.789
Is it? Really?

05:33.041 --> 05:34.459
Historical stuff.

05:40.548 --> 05:41.758
Hello.

05:44.886 --> 05:46.679
Hey, you!

05:49.891 --> 05:52.060
-Who are you?
-It's me, Seok Cho.

05:54.228 --> 05:56.189
Right, Seok Cho.

05:56.314 --> 05:59.692
I love your webtoons. You're great!

05:59.817 --> 06:01.861
You're the first one to debut among us.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.072
No, it's nothing.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.531
Don't be so modest.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.035
All I want to do is draw what I want.

06:10.244 --> 06:13.873
That's because you don't know.
After a year or so, you run out of ideas.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.169
That's why I'm taking a break
and going on a trip.

06:19.128 --> 06:20.838
Well, good luck.

06:21.339 --> 06:22.173
Keep the change.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.012
You're so full of yourself!

06:28.387 --> 06:30.556
You have no respect for the viewers.

06:33.309 --> 06:36.437
Jerk. Complaining like that
after only one year...

06:36.562 --> 06:39.690
Why don't you give me your job
if you hate it that much?

06:40.817 --> 06:42.235
Just wait until I'm famous...

06:54.038 --> 06:56.666
I told him not to mix whites with colors.

07:06.592 --> 07:08.094
CHO'S CHICKEN

07:09.679 --> 07:11.013
CHEOL-WANG CHO (57)
NOTE: HE'S A PIECE OF WORK

07:11.139 --> 07:12.932
No customers!

07:13.057 --> 07:14.934
I haven't done much today,
but it's already 6 p.m.

07:15.726 --> 07:16.644
I should go home.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.448
What? It's closed?
A chicken place that's closed at six?

07:29.073 --> 07:33.703
I've never seen this place open.
It's out of business, I guess. Let's go.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.666
Bro, want to have a drink tonight?
When do you get off work?

07:38.791 --> 07:40.543
All the senior employees
are still working.

07:40.668 --> 07:44.547
Ah, I see. You can't go home
until they go home.

07:44.672 --> 07:47.049
That's why I'm sitting here,
doing nothing.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.677
Keep doing what you're doing. You gotta
be careful when you're a new hire.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.976
JUN CHO (32)

07:57.101 --> 08:00.855
NEW HIRE: CAN'T GO HOME BECAUSE
OF ASSISTANT MANAGER MR. KIM

08:01.439 --> 08:03.983
MR. KIM: CAN'T GO HOME
BECAUSE OF MANAGER MR. PARK

08:04.525 --> 08:06.819
MR. PARK: CAN'T GO HOME
BECAUSE OF SENIOR MANAGER MR. SEO

08:07.570 --> 08:10.406
MR. SEO: CAN'T GO HOME
BECAUSE OF DIRECTOR MR. EOM

08:10.990 --> 08:15.036
MR. EOM: CAN'T GO HOME
BECAUSE OF THE PRESIDENT

08:15.953 --> 08:18.039
PRESIDENT

08:18.247 --> 08:21.959
NO ONE IS WORKING RIGHT NOW

08:27.507 --> 08:28.382
Why are you so early?

08:28.508 --> 08:30.635
There were no customers,
so I closed the shop on time.

08:31.093 --> 08:32.011
On time, huh?

08:36.807 --> 08:38.726
Oh, what's the use?

08:43.147 --> 08:44.065
What are you doing?

08:44.190 --> 08:46.192
I was gonna order some pig feet.
Good ones.

08:46.317 --> 08:49.987
Who looks at coupon books
these days? So primitive...

08:51.113 --> 08:53.282
A smartphone can do everything!

08:54.033 --> 08:54.909
I'll do it for you!

08:57.370 --> 09:00.706
-Done!
-Oh, you know how to do things like that?

09:01.666 --> 09:03.668
Everyone does.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.674
Buy some pig feet. Good ones.

09:17.098 --> 09:19.141
There's nothing a smartphone can't do.

09:26.857 --> 09:28.109
It's hard to make a living.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.320
Mom, where are my everyday clothes?

09:31.445 --> 09:33.948
They're in the veranda.
I washed them!

09:34.657 --> 09:36.576
Mom, why do they look like this?

09:39.245 --> 09:41.664
I can't believe he is my son, too.

09:51.424 --> 09:55.052
Didn't I tell you
not to mix your whites with jeans?

09:59.515 --> 10:02.268
Don't touch my food, you bums.

10:03.394 --> 10:04.979
Frying chickens all day long is hard work!

10:05.104 --> 10:07.356
-I have a job now!
-I really want to eat that!

10:09.317 --> 10:11.277
USELESS SON,
$300 OPERATING LOSS/MONTH

10:11.402 --> 10:13.487
FIRST SALARY TO BE DEPOSITED

10:15.573 --> 10:17.241
Right, you're making money now.

10:20.578 --> 10:23.539
-Mom, I'm the best, right?
-I have no other options.

10:23.664 --> 10:25.875
Mom, soon, I'll be a real cartoonist.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.086
I met with a guy at a webtoon company
today, and I think it's gonna happen.

10:29.211 --> 10:30.046
-Really?
-Really?

10:30.171 --> 10:31.255
-Really?
-What is it?

10:34.925 --> 10:36.719
Sado in the Rice Chest.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.984
That sounds better than I expected.

10:57.615 --> 11:02.286
THE SOUND OF YOUR HEART

11:28.896 --> 11:30.314
Private Kim!

11:30.439 --> 11:32.691
Private Kim! No!

11:40.408 --> 11:41.450
Private Kim!

11:47.832 --> 11:49.750
Hey, you in the back!

11:49.875 --> 11:51.293
What are you doing?

11:51.419 --> 11:53.546
I got caught up in my emotions!

11:55.923 --> 11:59.385
You're a North Korean soldier, right?
Private Kim is a South Korean soldier!

11:59.510 --> 12:01.220
He's not on your side!

12:02.388 --> 12:04.849
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

12:04.974 --> 12:06.767
Can I go to the bathroom?

12:09.061 --> 12:13.149
Oh, crap!
I'm not going to be paid today.

12:14.692 --> 12:16.610
That sucker won't stop nagging me.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.321
What a nasty guy!
Way too obsessed with details.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.449
No one will probably notice
if I don't go back.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.201
I'll just take a nap.

12:26.662 --> 12:28.581
CHO'S CHICKEN

12:29.874 --> 12:32.209
My primary job is
to run this chicken place.

12:32.793 --> 12:35.087
I cashed in my entire retirement fund
to open this place,

12:35.212 --> 12:38.507
but running my own business
wasn't as easy as I thought it'd be.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.886
And soon, I got a series of second jobs.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.972
I'll pay you $8 if you glue 100 eyes.

12:45.097 --> 12:46.307
-A hundred eyes?
-Yes.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.433
Yes, all right.

12:50.060 --> 12:52.229
-All done.
-Oh, you're fast!

12:55.149 --> 12:56.609
What the hell is this?

12:57.610 --> 12:58.694
I'm not paying you!

13:00.029 --> 13:02.156
Do you have a package for No. 412?

13:02.281 --> 13:03.866
Oh, the apples sent from Daegu!

13:03.991 --> 13:05.326
Yeah, that's right.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.244
Oh, they were delicious!

13:07.953 --> 13:09.830
What? You ate them?

13:09.955 --> 13:12.082
-Why?
-The note said to give it to me.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.628
-What?
-The note said, "Give this to the guard."

13:15.753 --> 13:18.130
Are you bossing me around?

13:18.255 --> 13:21.509
Ask anyone who is right and who is wrong!

13:21.634 --> 13:22.760
-On the box--
-Fine, let's ask.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.428
It said to give the box to me.

13:25.513 --> 13:29.141
Out of all my jobs,
being an extra is the most fun.

13:29.266 --> 13:30.142
Action!

13:31.810 --> 13:35.523
-Please let us go out with each other.
-How dare you go out with my son!

13:37.525 --> 13:39.360
How dare you go out with my son!

13:42.238 --> 13:44.698
How dare you go out with my son!

13:49.495 --> 13:53.499
Today, I'm a North Korean soldier
in a film about the Korean War.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.588
What happened? Where is everyone?

14:03.342 --> 14:05.886
No one noticed I was missing?

14:06.011 --> 14:07.972
They pay no attention to details!

14:14.436 --> 14:17.314
THE WAY

14:19.942 --> 14:22.945
Oh, no! No more toilet paper!

14:38.836 --> 14:41.046
Great, I have enough toilet paper.

14:59.857 --> 15:01.775
-What?
-If it is okay with you...

15:01.901 --> 15:03.485
can you pass me some toilet paper?

15:07.239 --> 15:11.619
Yeah, this is all I have, but--

15:14.121 --> 15:15.039
Thank you.

15:19.293 --> 15:22.463
All the congressmen are gathering
in the chamber.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.632
The president will attend
the general assembly tonight

15:24.757 --> 15:27.009
and propose a policy
regarding North Korea.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.560
-Where are you going?
-To the National Assembly.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.062
I parked my car there.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.900
You refused to take a passenger!

15:43.192 --> 15:44.151
Oh, well...

15:51.700 --> 15:53.577
Bro, where are you?
Are you home?

15:53.702 --> 15:56.455
No, I had something to do.
Everything went fine.

16:04.296 --> 16:07.758
-Thank you for the pants.
-What?

16:15.724 --> 16:18.102
Oh, my gosh!
It's a big one this time!

16:27.778 --> 16:28.737
Excuse me.

16:30.739 --> 16:33.075
I came to wipe out
the puppet capitalists in South Korea!

16:33.200 --> 16:35.327
I will burn down the National Assembly!

16:37.329 --> 16:40.040
Are you okay?
How do I get to the National Assembly?

16:41.834 --> 16:44.628
-Help me!
-What's the matter with you?

16:45.379 --> 16:47.923
-A strange man is here!
-What are you doing?

16:49.133 --> 16:50.050
What's wrong?

16:50.718 --> 16:52.219
Open the door!

17:13.532 --> 17:14.533
Oh, thank you!

17:14.658 --> 17:16.535
You didn't need to do all this.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.413
What are you saying?

17:19.538 --> 17:22.583
My son has come home after a long time.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.502
Why haven't I heard from you
in all this time?

17:26.295 --> 17:27.129
What?

17:39.183 --> 17:42.186
-Eat up, Deok-hwan!
-Yes, ma'am--

17:44.354 --> 17:45.355
Yes, Mom!

17:47.691 --> 17:49.276
He's in Mrs. Kim's house.
She has dementia.

17:49.401 --> 17:52.529
-Is he really a North Korean spy?
-Mrs. Kim's son died. She's all alone.

17:52.946 --> 17:54.114
This way!

18:01.955 --> 18:03.373
Mrs. Kim, you're in danger!

18:03.499 --> 18:06.502
Bring him out and we'll take care of him!

18:06.627 --> 18:09.129
Leave my son alone!

18:15.135 --> 18:17.888
Don't dare cross this line!

18:18.013 --> 18:20.057
You all know who I am, right?

18:51.421 --> 18:52.548
Bastard!

19:00.139 --> 19:01.431
Take these.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.102
And read it on the way.
I wrote you a letter.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.437
Take care of yourself.

19:07.688 --> 19:11.650
Son, come back soon.

19:12.484 --> 19:13.610
I'll come back, Mom.

19:20.367 --> 19:21.493
I'm all done now, but...

19:30.836 --> 19:32.004
This can't do the job.

19:47.769 --> 19:48.604
What?

19:49.688 --> 19:52.691
Hey, you! Can't you see
I'm in the military?

19:53.025 --> 19:56.278
So what?
What do you want from me?

19:58.238 --> 19:59.823
Hey, stop it!

20:01.158 --> 20:04.161
Stop yelling in public. Stop it!

20:10.918 --> 20:13.462
Don't they teach you manners in the army?

20:13.587 --> 20:14.963
Which camp do you belong to?

20:15.672 --> 20:17.466
Camp Maso.

20:17.799 --> 20:18.759
Camp Maso?

20:20.010 --> 20:22.554
The one that has loudspeakers
towards North Korea?

20:22.679 --> 20:26.308
Military life in South Korea seems
very nice and comfortable these days.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.895
Can you guys fight back
if the North attacks?

20:30.979 --> 20:31.939
Can you fight back?

20:34.483 --> 20:36.485
Can you fight back?

20:39.696 --> 20:41.281
I've finished wiping, but...

20:42.324 --> 20:43.867
How do I leave?

21:15.482 --> 21:19.069
It's okay. They can't see my face.
They don't know who I am.

21:26.076 --> 21:29.204
It's okay. They can't see my face!

21:29.746 --> 21:32.374
The president has just finished
the keynote speech.

21:32.499 --> 21:34.876
The general assembly will begin soon.

21:35.002 --> 21:35.919
This assembly is--

21:37.421 --> 21:38.297
Pervert!

21:41.967 --> 21:42.843
What is he doing?

21:44.845 --> 21:47.389
There are so many crazy guys in the world.

21:49.224 --> 21:51.310
Why hasn't Seok come home yet?

21:52.311 --> 21:53.145
Don't know.

21:54.187 --> 21:55.522
We have breaking news tonight.

21:55.647 --> 21:58.900
A North Korean spy appeared
in the suburban areas of Seoul.

21:59.026 --> 22:01.653
He is armed with a rifle

22:01.778 --> 22:04.031
and is heading to the National Assembly.

22:04.156 --> 22:07.784
The president and congressmen
have escaped the building,

22:07.909 --> 22:09.536
and the area is in a state of disorder.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.747
The police have assigned
additional forces to the area.

22:11.872 --> 22:12.706
Holy cow!

22:13.999 --> 22:16.084
I'm too scared to go out.

22:17.044 --> 22:18.545
Why hasn't your dad come home yet?

22:19.629 --> 22:20.464
Don't know.

22:31.933 --> 22:33.060
Hey, why are you crying?

22:37.481 --> 22:38.940
Hey, you, why are you crying?

22:40.442 --> 22:42.444
Why are you all crying?

22:43.403 --> 22:45.447
Did someone die or something?
Why are you crying?

22:45.947 --> 22:49.117
This stop is the National Assembly.

23:20.690 --> 23:22.734
Where are you going, bastard?

23:31.785 --> 23:33.995
Even so, how could you
run around half-naked?

23:34.454 --> 23:35.789
I had no choice.

23:36.373 --> 23:38.917
You should've taken your shirt off
and covered your crotch instead.

23:43.338 --> 23:46.341
No, I'm not! Listen to me!

23:46.466 --> 23:47.884
I'm not!

23:48.260 --> 23:50.720
Listen to me! I'm not!

24:14.744 --> 24:17.914
Like I said, this outfit is for a film.

24:18.039 --> 24:21.668
Wow, you're highly trained.
Your South Korean accent is perfect.

24:22.043 --> 24:26.089
You crossed the border,
eating these potatoes.

24:26.756 --> 24:30.427
And this is a mother's letter to her son
who has a secret mission.

24:31.428 --> 24:32.762
"My dearest son...

24:33.138 --> 24:37.100
Go to Seoul
and achieve your goal as planned.

24:37.225 --> 24:40.854
You must move forward
even if you have to risk your life."

24:41.188 --> 24:42.814
That was written by an old lady

24:42.939 --> 24:45.066
who was suffering from dementia.

24:45.192 --> 24:48.153
An old lady with dementia?
That's what you call your mother?

24:48.278 --> 24:50.614
You cold-blooded piece of crap!

24:50.739 --> 24:52.741
You're driving me nuts!

24:56.286 --> 24:57.829
All right, let's talk about this.

24:58.788 --> 25:01.583
Other than this outfit, is there any
evidence proving I'm from North Korea?

25:04.169 --> 25:09.382
There's evidence that shows you came
to collect military information.

25:12.385 --> 25:14.888
Military life in South Korea seems
very nice and comfortable these days.

25:15.013 --> 25:18.558
Can you guys fight back
if the North attacks?

25:24.147 --> 25:25.440
-Mom!
-Excuse me.

25:25.565 --> 25:28.401
-I got a call saying my son is here.
-There he is.

25:30.237 --> 25:32.614
-Mom!
-Honey!

25:42.874 --> 25:44.542
We're in the wrong place.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.003
-Right.
-Let's go.

25:59.808 --> 26:04.354
THEY ARE NOT OUR FAMILY

26:08.149 --> 26:11.945
When he moved into this neighborhood,
he was looking for a house facing north.

26:12.070 --> 26:15.949
He loved North Korean food,
like cold noodles and blood sausage.

26:16.074 --> 26:17.534
It makes sense now.

26:17.659 --> 26:19.953
I was so scared.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.414
I pretended I was suffering from dementia.

26:22.539 --> 26:25.625
I acted like I knew nothing.
That's how I survived.

26:25.750 --> 26:28.044
He looks exactly like a spy.

26:28.169 --> 26:30.297
I even called the police once.

26:30.422 --> 26:35.302
The truth is, I don't know what he did
before I was born.

26:36.428 --> 26:40.307
He listens to the radio
with a blanket over his head.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.475
I did think it was strange.

26:43.101 --> 26:46.104
Did you know the suspected
North Korean spy, Cheol-wang Cho,

26:46.229 --> 26:47.522
was living in this neighborhood?

26:47.647 --> 26:50.942
There was someone like that
in this neighborhood? I had no clue!

26:52.360 --> 26:55.613
THE NEIGHBORS HAVE
BEEN LIVING IN DANGER
