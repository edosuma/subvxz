11:56.924 --> 11:58.843
-These pups are here

11:58.968 --> 12:02.721
to rescue the soul
of the holiday season

12:02.847 --> 12:04.932
and save the North Pole!

12:07.435 --> 12:11.730

this golden heart charm

12:11.856 --> 12:14.942
filled with
a little Christmas magic.

12:17.028 --> 12:18.905
-Wow! [oohs and ahhs]

12:19.030 --> 12:21.157

like this before!

12:23.493 --> 12:26.204
-That is so cool!
-Did you see that?

12:27.706 --> 12:28.998
-Awesome.

12:29.123 --> 12:32.252
-Kids will adopt you
and give you a name.

12:32.377 --> 12:35.296
They'll cuddle and snuggle
to show they believe,

12:35.422 --> 12:39.175
which will give you your magic
on each Christmas Eve.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.134
-Ruff!

12:40.260 --> 12:42.262
-So, how do they help?

12:42.387 --> 12:44.431
-Gather 'round. Gather 'round.

12:44.556 --> 12:49.436
Pups, use your brown barrel
to collect and store that light.

12:49.561 --> 12:53.856
Keep it safe and secure.
Lock it up tight.

12:53.981 --> 12:57.110
-We promise to do good
and carry out kindness

12:57.235 --> 13:00.071
to help build Christmas Cheer.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.031
-What do you think
"doing good" means?

13:02.156 --> 13:04.825
-I think it's being nice.
-What does Dad say?

13:04.951 --> 13:07.746
-He says doing good
is thinking about other people

13:07.870 --> 13:09.247
before you think about yourself.

13:09.372 --> 13:12.709
-So, like, when I have candy
and you want some,

13:12.833 --> 13:14.586
and I don't eat it
all by myself?

13:14.711 --> 13:17.464
-You mean you share it with me?

13:17.589 --> 13:20.216
-Yeah, something like that!

13:23.470 --> 13:25.305
Do you think
we could do something good?

13:25.430 --> 13:26.640
-I think so.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.142
-Whatcha doin'?

13:29.267 --> 13:31.436
-Talking about
doing something kind.

13:31.561 --> 13:33.605
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah!

13:33.730 --> 13:37.567
We just made a promise
to help build Christmas Cheer!

13:37.692 --> 13:38.901
-Okay!

13:39.860 --> 13:42.029
-Really? Thanks!

13:42.155 --> 13:43.615
-You're welcome.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.158
-Well, from what I could tell,

13:45.283 --> 13:47.201
Bob's Helping Hands
could use some help.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.745
-Yeah!

13:48.869 --> 13:51.748
-What can we do?
We're just kids!

13:51.872 --> 13:54.459
-I'm sure there's something.

13:54.584 --> 13:56.919
-When I was with Dad
the other day,

13:57.044 --> 13:58.879
he was really sad.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.007
No one would help us.

14:01.132 --> 14:03.384
-Yeah, it was the same way
for us.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.595
Everyone was just too busy
to come to the door.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.181
-Or just too self-absorbed.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.848
-What does that mean?

14:09.974 --> 14:11.643
-Never mind.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.353
You'll learn about it
when you grow up.

14:13.478 --> 14:16.272
Really, I think the answer
could be sort of simple.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.733
We could donate some things
ourselves.

14:18.857 --> 14:21.695
-To Bob's Helping Hands?

14:21.820 --> 14:24.781
-I love that idea!
-Me, too!

14:24.905 --> 14:28.284
-Change is going to have
to start with us!

14:28.409 --> 14:30.745
-I have some birthday money
from Gran.

14:30.870 --> 14:34.374
And some from Uncle Patrick
and Aunt Lilly.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.209
-I have some from babysitting.

14:36.334 --> 14:39.128
-I have some
from raking Ms. Denise's lawn

14:39.253 --> 14:41.922
and helping
with Ms. Catherine's yard sale.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.133
-Let's go tell Brandon!

14:45.719 --> 14:46.720
-Great job!

14:48.221 --> 14:50.348
-Oh, wait!
-Quick! She's coming back!

14:50.473 --> 14:52.308
-I forgot Sampson!

14:55.645 --> 14:59.607
Hmm, I don't remember
leaving you like that.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.025
Oh, well.

15:02.861 --> 15:05.029
Bye, Joy Sugar Cookie!

15:07.198 --> 15:09.909
-This was a really good idea.
-Yeah!

15:10.034 --> 15:13.996
-I've got the list, so we'll go
get the stuff that's on sale.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.417

15:21.880 --> 15:25.550
-I want the Rockin' Robot 400!

15:25.675 --> 15:27.802
-I want the Tween Machine!

15:27.927 --> 15:31.180
-I told you no!
-But, Mom, please!

15:31.305 --> 15:33.224
-I've already told you.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.685
You're going to have to ask
Santa for that.

15:35.810 --> 15:38.020
-I don't want to ask Santa!

15:38.145 --> 15:39.773
-[sighs] Where were we?

15:39.898 --> 15:43.150
-Hang on.
I've got more right here.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.403
-So, how much do we have?

15:45.528 --> 15:46.987
-About $80.

15:47.113 --> 15:50.032
-Perfect. I think that's
about what we figured.

15:50.157 --> 15:52.535

-Sort of.

16:22.899 --> 16:24.818
Too bad you didn't come by
yesterday.

16:24.943 --> 16:27.278
We were running
a two-for-one sale on these.

16:27.403 --> 16:31.407
-You mean it's not on sale?
It's all regular price today?

16:31.532 --> 16:33.326
-[sighs] Afraid so.

16:33.451 --> 16:38.122
That comes to $100.89.

16:40.207 --> 16:42.418
-Christa,
any more money in there?

16:42.543 --> 16:44.504
-Let me check,
but I don't think so.

16:44.629 --> 16:47.757

you gave me everything?

16:47.882 --> 16:49.467
Check your pockets again.

16:49.592 --> 16:53.095
-Oh, come on!
What's the hold up?

16:53.220 --> 16:55.640
-What's taking so long?
-What is with these kids?

16:55.765 --> 16:58.935
-I want to go play with my toys!
-Where are their parents?

16:59.059 --> 17:01.187
-Look, kids,
just put something back.

17:01.312 --> 17:03.230
What's all this stuff for
anyway?

17:03.356 --> 17:06.108
-We just picked up some things
to help Bob's Helping Hands.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.527
-It's just that we thought...

17:07.652 --> 17:10.613
-You're doing all this
for Bob's Helping Hands?

17:10.738 --> 17:13.950

this Christmas!

17:14.074 --> 17:15.618
-Oh!

17:15.743 --> 17:18.913
Okay!
Everyone settle down!

17:19.038 --> 17:20.581
-My dad runs that place,

17:20.707 --> 17:22.792
and he probably wouldn't like us
talking about it,

17:22.917 --> 17:24.836
but the pantry is pretty empty.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.754
-And, without our help,

17:26.880 --> 17:30.758
there are going to be
a lot of hungry people.

17:30.884 --> 17:33.594
-That is something really
special you kids are doing.

17:37.348 --> 17:39.350
-What are you doing?

17:39.475 --> 17:41.602
-I used to go
to Bob's Helping Hands

17:41.728 --> 17:43.563

a little extra help!

to do something good.
