WEBVTT

00:04.184 --> 00:06.790
ER

00:06.891 --> 00:08.249
Previously on ER...

00:08.250 --> 00:10.599
Peter!
Oh, hi, Lizzie.

00:10.634 --> 00:13.011
I think it's about time
you and I had a little sit-down.

00:13.012 --> 00:13.912
Is there a problem?

00:13.913 --> 00:16.784
- Am I hearing jealousy?
- I just that I think you're trouble.

00:17.185 --> 00:21.602
- What about his heroin addiction?
- It wasn't heroin. It was painkillers.

00:21.603 --> 00:25.127
I'll do an ultrarapid detox
and end his addiction today.

00:25.128 --> 00:27.398
You're gonna keep him hiden here
for 12 hours?

00:27.399 --> 00:30.072
I found Doug in Exam 4,
detoxing this baby.

00:30.073 --> 00:34.498
What! You're gonna explain this to the
Administration and the Executive Committee!

00:34.499 --> 00:37.139
You lied to me, Doug.
You looked me right in the face and lied.

00:37.930 --> 00:40.701
"A Hole In The Heart"

00:43.072 --> 00:44.100
That's not fair.

00:44.320 --> 00:45.893
You wouldn't have let me do it.

00:46.067 --> 00:47.888
You couldn't monitor him!

00:48.105 --> 00:51.181
EKG, pulse ox, end-tidal CO-2,
and invasive BP.

00:51.391 --> 00:53.875
- You never got consent.
- From his methadone-chugging mom?

00:54.094 --> 00:57.335
DCFS would have followed through
if you'd left it alone.

00:57.546 --> 00:59.617
His development is already stunted.

00:59.834 --> 01:02.826
Been expecting you.
Your desk clerk just called.

01:03.202 --> 01:04.397
- Admit orders?
- None.

01:04.617 --> 01:06.568
Here's everything
you need right there.

01:06.779 --> 01:11.677
Start him on labetalol titrate 0.5 q
five minutes to a diastolic of 60.

01:11.978 --> 01:14.970
Alexander Babcock,
pediatric anesthesiologist.

01:15.180 --> 01:19.665
Kerry Weaver, Acting Chief of ER.
This is Josh McNeal, 7 months old-

01:19.839 --> 01:24.571
The boy was born addicted to heroin.
I put him on an ultrarapid detox.

01:24.788 --> 01:28.905
- A couple have been done in the US.
- It's still an experimental procedure.

01:29.113 --> 01:30.901
BP's not bad, 150/90.

01:31.111 --> 01:34.801
This boy needs to be stabilized
and put back on methadone...

01:35.020 --> 01:37.137
...until Administration and Legal
reviews the case.

01:37.308 --> 01:40.419
- What did you use to induce?
- Ketamine and Narcan.

01:40.635 --> 01:43.083
- Propofol's better.
- ER didn't have it.

01:43.296 --> 01:47.781
But we got it up here. D/C the
ketamine and three mgs of propofol.

01:47.955 --> 01:49.859
Then 150 mics per kilo per minute.

01:50.076 --> 01:51.731
You're continuing with this?

01:51.948 --> 01:54.100
The approach seems
medically reasonable.

01:54.277 --> 01:57.931
You cannot perform procedures
on children without permission.

01:58.104 --> 02:02.587
It seems in the best interest of the
child to complete what's been started.

02:02.803 --> 02:04.341
- Who's the follow-through?
- I am.

02:04.799 --> 02:07.414
I'm off work till tomorrow,
so I'll stay.

02:08.585 --> 02:10.571
Your actions are totally
irresponsible.

02:10.747 --> 02:14.024
You've broken every rule and
regulation we have in the ER.

02:14.241 --> 02:16.311
What happens here won't change that.

02:16.487 --> 02:19.598
I want him to have a shot at life.
I don't care about rules.

02:19.815 --> 02:23.387
I hope you also don't care about
being an ER Pediatric Attending.

02:23.599 --> 02:25.999
You've given up any chance of that.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.074

03:21.396 --> 03:23.470
- Mark, 7:00.
- What?

03:23.814 --> 03:26.648
Seven o'clock. Rise and shine.

03:28.984 --> 03:31.474
Did you hear from the PICU
about that baby?

03:31.651 --> 03:34.320
Haleh just went off duty.
She didn't mention anything.

03:34.487 --> 03:36.479
Am I supposed to wake up Dr. Weaver?

03:36.697 --> 03:39.186
- She stayed too?
- Snoozing in Exam 4.

03:39.406 --> 03:40.734
Let her sleep.

03:40.948 --> 03:43.155
Come on, girls. Sweep, sweep, sweep!

03:43.367 --> 03:45.489
- Randi's in my way!
- I'm supposed to be here!

03:45.701 --> 03:47.657
- Curling?
- We were inspired by Nagano.

03:47.869 --> 03:50.740
Three years and nine months
left till Salt Lake City.

03:50.954 --> 03:53.077
These crazy white folk.

03:53.331 --> 03:55.239
You having a slumber party?

03:55.457 --> 03:57.698
No. Did you hear anything from Doug?

03:57.916 --> 04:00.371
No. Is that why you spent the night?

04:00.585 --> 04:03.750
I was nostalgic for my residency.
I thought Carol was here.

04:03.962 --> 04:05.835
She is. But she's on a break.

04:06.005 --> 04:08.162
There's no new patients,
why'd you wake me?

04:08.339 --> 04:11.209
- Haleh said 7:00.
- That was for Dr. Weaver.

04:11.425 --> 04:13.547
Forget it.
I'll just get some breakfast.

04:13.759 --> 04:17.173
Can you call Anspaugh
and find out his schedule?

04:17.386 --> 04:20.801
- I need a meeting with him soon.
- Okay.

04:21.389 --> 04:24.838
- You didn't answer me.
- No idea how they got their names.

04:25.016 --> 04:27.719
The drinks go down so smoothly
at the Velvet Lounge.

04:27.934 --> 04:31.301
- I wouldn't know that.
- That's what this is about.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.310
I was drinking and you weren't.

04:33.520 --> 04:36.353
- You know I don't drink.
- You think I drink too much.

04:36.521 --> 04:38.016
Damn it, we missed the 7: 10.

04:38.231 --> 04:41.100
We can get the next one and
cross over at Madison.

04:41.316 --> 04:45.692
No, I can't. I've gotta go to Carla's
and pick up Reece for daycare.

04:46.402 --> 04:48.561
You always like this
after a night out?

04:48.779 --> 04:51.483
What? We saw the whole show.

04:51.697 --> 04:53.689
We didn't need to stay
for another set.

04:53.906 --> 04:56.775
- I thought we were having a good time.
- We were.

04:56.991 --> 05:00.193
Until I made that song request.
The look on your face...

05:02.703 --> 05:06.864
There's some places that you go
to listen to the music, just listen.

05:07.080 --> 05:09.867
So it's not like the pub
where you can play darts...

05:10.041 --> 05:14.582
...nobody cares if you drink too much
or put something stupid on the jukebox.

05:14.794 --> 05:17.365
I'm saying in a place like that,
it wasn't cool.

05:17.586 --> 05:21.001
Well, if you ask me,
being cool seems somewhat limiting.

05:21.505 --> 05:22.536
You taking this one?

05:23.673 --> 05:26.673
Yes, I think I will.
I'll see you in there?

05:27.009 --> 05:29.047
- Yeah.
- Okay.

05:32.846 --> 05:35.798
Why didn't you wake me?
I have a meeting with Anspaugh.

05:36.013 --> 05:40.176
We woke up Dr. Greene by mistake.
We just got two bounce-back migraines.

05:40.392 --> 05:41.505
One's mine.

05:41.724 --> 05:44.476
A fractured clavicle, complaining
of coldness to his hand.

05:44.685 --> 05:47.721
A suicidal guy with intention marks
to his left wrist.

05:47.896 --> 05:49.472
Who else is on?

05:49.688 --> 05:51.845
Del Amico, Jeanie and Carter
are coming.

05:52.064 --> 05:56.060
In other words, they're late.
I'm the only one here. Why is that?

05:56.274 --> 05:58.943
Thank you, Lydia. I'll be right out.

06:01.320 --> 06:06.192
- I thought you might want a refill.
- I just got one. Thanks.

06:06.531 --> 06:10.574
- I hear it's supposed to rain.
- You want to talk about last night?

06:11.534 --> 06:15.530
- It's very serious what Doug did.
- You mean what we did, don't you?

06:16.328 --> 06:18.652
It's the nature of your job...

06:18.872 --> 06:22.120
...to assist a doctor when
they ask you.

06:22.332 --> 06:25.580
I was there because I wanted to be.
Not because Doug asked me.

06:25.750 --> 06:29.414
I'm sure you were. Doug can be
pretty passionate about these kids.

06:29.627 --> 06:31.750
Oh, give me a little credit, Mark.

06:31.962 --> 06:35.412
You think I'm a fresh-faced nursing
student under the doctor's spell?

06:35.922 --> 06:38.957
I'm only saying that Legal
and Administration...

06:39.175 --> 06:41.415
...are going over every
detail of this case.

06:41.634 --> 06:43.958
I'd hate to see it reflect
on your record.

06:44.176 --> 06:46.714
So you're saying I should fudge
my involvement?

06:46.930 --> 06:50.426
Tell the truth. Tell them
you were assisting a doctor.

06:50.597 --> 06:52.720
I insisted on being there because...

06:52.932 --> 06:55.932
...Doug was working in the best
interest of the patient.

06:56.142 --> 06:59.095
And that's my job.
Every bit as much as it is his.

06:59.812 --> 07:00.925
I gotta get back.

07:04.688 --> 07:06.728
We had our noses pressed on the glass.

07:06.940 --> 07:08.932
The tracks moved right beneath us.

07:09.150 --> 07:11.355
- You've never done that before?
- No.

07:11.567 --> 07:13.892
All you have to do is ask.

07:14.403 --> 07:15.433
- Hi.
- John.

07:15.653 --> 07:18.985
Have you ever ridden in the front car
of the El? With the driver?

07:19.196 --> 07:21.769
- I don't think so.
- Anna and Dr. Rosher just did.

07:21.948 --> 07:23.656
Max. Please. Max.

07:23.866 --> 07:25.573
Max. See you.

07:25.784 --> 07:27.575
- That sounds exciting.
- Yeah.

07:27.786 --> 07:29.907
Max just asked the guy if we could.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.691
- Pretty clever.
- Well, thank you, John.

07:32.913 --> 07:35.403
You'll give me that one.
But maybe not the next.

07:35.622 --> 07:38.292
I gotta go pry a kid's leg
out of a shopping cart.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.372
Call Maintenance.
Bolt cutters'll do it.

07:40.542 --> 07:41.573
Right.

07:41.794 --> 07:42.824
Does feel cold.

07:43.001 --> 07:45.623
That's what I'm saying.
It's the damnedest feeling.

07:45.837 --> 07:49.963
Nails are cyanotic, cap refill's poor
and he barely has a radial pulse.

07:50.130 --> 07:51.162
Doesn't sound good.

07:51.382 --> 07:55.674
I want to get an ultrasound and an
angiogram to rule out a blood clot...

07:55.884 --> 07:58.042
...which affects
blood flow to your hand.

07:58.260 --> 08:01.129
Whatever you need to do.
I've got great insurance.

08:01.304 --> 08:03.591
You get excellent care
here even without it.

08:03.805 --> 08:05.596
- Can I talk to you?
- Of course.

08:05.806 --> 08:08.806
Can you get consent from Mr. Wass
and schedule him?

08:08.975 --> 08:10.005
Okay.

08:10.225 --> 08:13.142
I have a call into Anspaugh's office
to talk about Doug.

08:13.312 --> 08:16.310
- I'm seeing him in a few minutes.
- We need to be involved.

08:16.521 --> 08:20.813
My meeting's about something that's
been on his calendar for a while.

08:21.023 --> 08:23.975
- I'll set up another for us two.
- Let me know the time.

08:24.192 --> 08:25.520
Don't worry, I will.

08:25.734 --> 08:29.517
Send home the rule-out appy in 3
with the diagnosis of constipation.

08:29.736 --> 08:31.645
Is there a good trauma on its way?

08:31.821 --> 08:34.904
No. But this letter came down
for you from Dr. Romano.

08:35.114 --> 08:37.238
He's a weird little dude, isn't he?

08:38.241 --> 08:42.023
- Did he drop this off himself?
- No. It was his secretary, I think.

08:42.327 --> 08:43.784
Where is he now, do you know?

08:43.995 --> 08:46.829
It's not my job to keep track
of stuff like that.

08:47.122 --> 08:51.035
On our way in he drank all of
his juice without spilling.

08:51.249 --> 08:52.280
Go play.

08:53.500 --> 08:54.663
There you go.

08:56.001 --> 08:58.917
Is he pretty responsive to you
these days?

08:59.128 --> 09:01.700
As responsive as a one-year-old
can be. Why?

09:01.921 --> 09:03.997
Sometimes it's hard
to get his attention.

09:04.214 --> 09:06.040
Have you had his hearing checked?

09:06.632 --> 09:08.423
- What?
- It's not a problem.

09:08.633 --> 09:10.341
Just things we notice.

09:10.969 --> 09:13.505
Reece. Reece. Come here, man.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.261
Come here. Come here.

09:15.471 --> 09:18.174
Oh. I know. I know.

09:18.389 --> 09:20.677
He seems pretty responsive to me.

09:21.349 --> 09:24.218
He probably gets distracted
by all the other kids.

09:25.976 --> 09:29.426
Listen, Carla's gonna pick him up
around 4, okay?

09:29.645 --> 09:32.349
Sure. That's fine, Dr. Benton.

09:33.231 --> 09:34.641
Who's hiding?

09:34.857 --> 09:36.019
Who's hiding?

09:36.233 --> 09:39.682
Hi, Reece.
Who are you playing with today, huh?

09:39.901 --> 09:42.356
I just feel so ridiculous.

09:42.820 --> 09:45.274
I never really meant to kill myself.

09:45.488 --> 09:47.313
So it wasn't just an accident?

09:50.323 --> 09:54.983
You see, my wife and I, we had
a fight, you know? And...

09:55.202 --> 09:58.366
So I went out to my workshop...

09:58.578 --> 10:02.491
...I brought a glass of
orange juice with me...

10:02.706 --> 10:04.744
...and I dropped the glass and...

10:04.957 --> 10:09.831
...when it broke, there was a shard
lying there and I just...

10:11.460 --> 10:13.334
I was just so angry.

10:13.545 --> 10:16.628
- So it was impulsive.
- It was stupid, is what it was.

10:16.839 --> 10:20.621
I worried my wife.
Although it's nice to know she cares.

10:22.008 --> 10:24.676
- This is Jeanie Boulet.
- I'm a Physician's Assistant.

10:24.884 --> 10:28.797
I'll suture up your cuts.
Shouldn't be more than a few stitches.

10:29.012 --> 10:31.337
A Psychiatric Resident
will speak to you.

10:31.555 --> 10:33.880
Oh, listen, I'm fine. Okay?

10:36.058 --> 10:38.891
This was just a mistake.
I really don't need that.

10:39.101 --> 10:42.183
We're sure it was. But it's
required in a case like this.

10:43.937 --> 10:45.135
Oh, man.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.311
Give it more time.

10:54.235 --> 10:56.025
Kerry.

10:56.694 --> 10:57.856
Hi.

10:59.237 --> 11:00.399
We're finishing up.

11:00.613 --> 11:04.230
Doug called an emergency meeting
to fill us in on Josh McNeal.

11:04.699 --> 11:05.730
I'm familiar with it.

11:05.951 --> 11:09.731
Because of the circumstances, I wanted
to bring everyone up to speed.

11:10.035 --> 11:12.952
Doug has admitted to
stepping over the line.

11:13.370 --> 11:15.943
But he prevented the baby
from going home.

11:16.164 --> 11:18.654
Anesthesia and Pediatrics
needed to be involved.

11:18.873 --> 11:21.280
And he needed to get
the mother's consent.

11:21.500 --> 11:24.500
He wouldn't have gotten it
if it meant losing her methadone.

11:24.710 --> 11:27.912
I knew Max was doing
a feasibility study on ER Pediatrics.

11:28.129 --> 11:30.085
I didn't want to jeopardize that.

11:30.255 --> 11:33.954
I think it's still the best thing
for County General.

11:34.173 --> 11:38.252
Doug, I don't want to minimize
the ramifications of this.

11:38.468 --> 11:41.136
- But thank you for coming forward.
- Sure.

11:41.344 --> 11:43.716
If you'll excuse me,
I want to get to PICU.

11:44.763 --> 11:46.590
Doug, thanks. We'll talk.

11:50.933 --> 11:55.011
Don, I don't think I need to tell you
that Doug's actions...

11:55.185 --> 11:58.101
...violated every policy we have
regarding patient care.

11:58.312 --> 12:02.011
I know. And there'll be
a full review and QA.

12:02.231 --> 12:05.729
It may not go so well for him.
But I must say...

12:05.942 --> 12:08.183
...he's certainly there
for his patients.

12:08.442 --> 12:10.566
I'm sorry this has eaten
into our time.

12:11.696 --> 12:14.315
What is it that you wanted to
talk to me about?

12:14.530 --> 12:18.904
Well, as you know, when David
Morgenstern had his Ml last fall...

12:19.115 --> 12:22.365
...I took over as Acting Chief
of Emergency Medicine.

12:22.617 --> 12:24.527
And you've done a fine job...

12:24.744 --> 12:28.870
...with the exception of that
little Ellis West/Synergix fiasco.

12:30.580 --> 12:34.790
With Dr. Morgenstern having resigned,
it seems appropriate for me...

12:34.958 --> 12:36.915
...to be Chief of ER.

12:37.126 --> 12:41.667
The department is running well, and we
owe you many thanks for your efforts.

12:41.879 --> 12:44.962
Well, I think everyone's
responded to my authority.

12:45.131 --> 12:47.455
So it's just a simple change
in title.

12:47.673 --> 12:50.792
I'm glad you'd like to be considered
for the position.

12:50.967 --> 12:54.797
We will be doing a national
search for the best candidate.

12:54.970 --> 12:57.091
But I'm happy you're throwing
your hat in the ring.

12:57.304 --> 13:01.466
- A national search?
- County policy, as I'm sure you know.

13:01.640 --> 13:03.466
Excuse me.

13:04.099 --> 13:06.345
Don Anspaugh.

13:12.908 --> 13:13.940
How's he doing?

13:14.160 --> 13:17.326
Pretty stable. Turned off
the propofol a half-hour ago.

13:17.538 --> 13:19.411
When's Doug gonna extubate?

13:19.623 --> 13:21.948
I figured I'd give him
a couple more minutes.

13:31.345 --> 13:32.375
Hey.

13:33.721 --> 13:36.047
I was in the middle of
a pretty decent dream.

13:36.432 --> 13:38.889
- Was I there?
- Big-time.

13:41.898 --> 13:43.521
Did I do the right thing?

13:45.651 --> 13:47.193
Yeah. You did.

13:47.485 --> 13:49.525
Even if we both get fired for it?

13:51.323 --> 13:53.730
That would just be icing on the cake.

13:59.164 --> 14:01.572
Kit, you ready to extubate him?

14:02.544 --> 14:04.867
He's breathing spontaneously.

14:06.130 --> 14:07.161
Vitals?

14:07.381 --> 14:11.960
Afebrile, BP's stable 90/70.

14:14.889 --> 14:16.135
Suction cath.

14:18.434 --> 14:19.893
Okay, buddy.

14:20.395 --> 14:22.019
Prove us right.

14:25.191 --> 14:26.354
Get ready to bag him.

14:26.568 --> 14:27.646
I'll do it.

14:33.117 --> 14:34.362
Here we go.

14:40.582 --> 14:41.613
Pulse ox?

14:41.792 --> 14:44.414
Holding steady. 98 percent.

14:45.711 --> 14:47.456
Do you think he's gonna make it?

14:48.966 --> 14:50.625
Too soon to tell.

14:53.596 --> 14:56.300
- Shirley, I'm looking for Dr. Romano.
- He's not here.

14:56.515 --> 14:58.841
- Do you have his schedule?
- He's not here.

14:59.059 --> 15:01.930
He went to some head-and-neck
conference in Costa Rica.

15:02.145 --> 15:05.017
- He doesn't do head-and-neck.
- Maybe he wants to learn.

15:05.233 --> 15:06.810
Maybe he's just playing golf.

15:07.026 --> 15:10.727
- So when's he due back?
- Teresa does the travel scheduling.

15:10.947 --> 15:12.690
Lovely. Where can I find her?

15:12.907 --> 15:15.660
Right here. Except she's on a break.

15:16.327 --> 15:18.367
I wanted to inform you on a patient.

15:18.580 --> 15:21.035
He's a 7-month-old boy,
addicted to heroin.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.407
- His mom stole his methadone.
- You know?

15:23.627 --> 15:26.498
Doug briefed us with your Chief
and some of the Pedes.

15:26.671 --> 15:27.869
There was a meeting?

15:28.089 --> 15:30.461
Kerry, I'm sure, can give you
the highlights.

15:30.675 --> 15:33.961
Anspaugh seemed calm. But, man,
if that had happened at CHoP...

15:34.179 --> 15:37.763
...Doug would've been fired.
Anyway, I gotta go to chart hell.

15:38.018 --> 15:39.511
- You seen Kerry?
- No. Sorry.

15:39.686 --> 15:42.687
We're concerned you get angry
in a self-destructive way.

15:42.855 --> 15:46.521
Look, I know I should handle
it better. Okay? And I will.

15:46.692 --> 15:49.693
But I really don't want to
stay overnight.

15:49.862 --> 15:52.436
I'm not a crazy person.
This was just stupid.

15:52.657 --> 15:55.361
I need to talk to you
for a minute, Dr. Meyers.

15:55.535 --> 15:56.780
Excuse us a moment.

15:57.996 --> 16:00.618
- He isn't staying?
- I don't have a reason to keep him.

16:00.832 --> 16:04.959
I pulled up his old records. He's
been here 3 times in the past year.

16:05.169 --> 16:07.210
Migraines, abdominal pain, back pain.

16:07.381 --> 16:10.050
- Think he's drug-seeking?
- He wants help.

16:10.259 --> 16:12.500
Depression is not grounds
for admission.

16:12.719 --> 16:15.174
- Hell, that'd be half the city.
- He's released?

16:15.388 --> 16:18.140
He's responsive, doesn't seem
suicidal or psychotic...

16:18.350 --> 16:20.842
...and he's willing to come in
for a follow-up.

16:21.061 --> 16:22.341
I wish we could do more.

16:22.563 --> 16:24.889
He's fighting with his wife,
job isn't good-

16:25.107 --> 16:27.147
I know; half the city.

16:27.402 --> 16:30.402
- Have you seen Dr. Weaver?
- Usually she's everywhere.

16:30.571 --> 16:33.656
Do you think it's too late
to reconsider my ER residency?

16:33.867 --> 16:35.526
Oh, you getting bored?

16:35.743 --> 16:38.614
Oh, I just cleaned out
an old guy's ears.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.582
And dislodging a 5-year-old
from a shopping cart-

16:41.792 --> 16:44.413
- Any unsickly patient is good.
- Stop complaining.

16:44.586 --> 16:49.130
- By 9:00, I'd been puked on twice.
- I also did two bowel disimpactions.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.833
Do you want to answer
the phones instead?

16:52.594 --> 16:55.381
Why don't you take
the coma patient in 4.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.303
- Paramedics have a double trauma.
- Double?

16:58.517 --> 17:01.269
Two Elvis impersonators crashed
into Lake Michigan. Cool.

17:01.479 --> 17:05.429
- Ooh. Maybe, Dr. Greene, I could...
- No, take the coma patient.

17:05.648 --> 17:06.811
Jeanie, Anna...

17:07.026 --> 17:09.433
...how about getting a handle
on the "Elvi. "

17:09.944 --> 17:12.436
We got your Over-the-Hill Elvis.

17:12.615 --> 17:16.316
Here's Junior Elvis. Parachuted out
of a plane to land on a pier.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.444
Lines got tangled. Lake landing.

17:18.662 --> 17:20.619
But he's up there picking his pimples.

17:20.830 --> 17:23.915
- Can't skydive to save his life.
- At least I can do Elvis.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.786
That's more than I can say
for you.

17:26.003 --> 17:28.541
I was doing Elvis before
you was even born.

17:28.757 --> 17:31.793
- I'll be doing him after you're dead.
- Shall we?

17:32.677 --> 17:37.554
You need anticoagulation therapy in
order to prevent any further clotting.

17:37.766 --> 17:39.675
- In the hospital?
- Not necessarily.

17:39.852 --> 17:42.140
There's a fairly new drug,
enoxaparin...

17:42.354 --> 17:45.687
...which you inject under the skin
in your abdomen twice a day.

17:45.857 --> 17:47.649
My wife could do that.

17:47.860 --> 17:50.350
You're an excellent candidate for it.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.109
Or you'd have to stay here
for a few days-

17:53.323 --> 17:56.028
I don't want to do that.
I'll take the drug.

17:56.201 --> 17:57.744
Okay, good.

17:57.953 --> 18:00.410
Kerry, I need to talk to you now.

18:00.624 --> 18:02.699
Sure. Nurse Jarvik will
discharge you.

18:03.209 --> 18:06.209
- Thanks.
- You're welcome. What do you got?

18:06.379 --> 18:09.795
Two jokers fell in the lake out
of an airplane or something.

18:10.008 --> 18:12.462
That Doug Ross meeting
happened this morning.

18:12.676 --> 18:15.714
- It sure did.
- I asked specifically to be notified.

18:15.931 --> 18:19.465
Mark, nobody told me either.
I just walked in on it.

18:19.684 --> 18:23.681
You could've mentioned it so I didn't
have to hear about it third-hand.

18:23.897 --> 18:26.684
- I had patients. Give the bullet.
- I already did.

18:26.858 --> 18:27.889
Give it again.

18:28.110 --> 18:31.811
- A Junior Elvis-
- Jeanie, we've got this. Help Anna.

18:32.073 --> 18:35.358
Tell that wanna-be his "Heartbreak
Hotel" sucks the big one.

18:35.576 --> 18:38.826
Oriented and alert.
Vitals normal. BP 120/70.

18:39.037 --> 18:40.235
Cap refill's fine.

18:40.456 --> 18:42.414
BP's high. 180/120.

18:42.626 --> 18:44.700
- Good luck.
- Better here than in there.

18:44.919 --> 18:47.410
Those two make the Elvises
sound like Boy Scouts.

18:52.636 --> 18:54.961
- Spin a crit and dip a urine.
- Want a Chem-7?

18:55.179 --> 18:56.259
Sure.

18:56.891 --> 19:00.673
- Why didn't they tell us?
- Why don't you ask your pal Doug?

19:00.893 --> 19:05.271
- Do you think there'll be an inquiry?
- Hopefully, Doug will let us know.

19:05.440 --> 19:08.524
Why're you angry at me?
I didn't detox a baby and hide it.

19:08.735 --> 19:11.191
But giving him an inch,
he gets away with a mile.

19:11.404 --> 19:14.110
- So this is my fault?
- It's not a question of fault.

19:14.283 --> 19:19.194
It's about style. You close your eyes
and hope things will disappear.

19:19.372 --> 19:20.402
Here.

19:20.623 --> 19:23.957
When I try to come down firmly,
you tell me to pull back...

19:24.127 --> 19:29.085
...you fight me and it'll disappear.
It's not disappearing this time, is it?

19:29.299 --> 19:31.290
It's not the time or place
to discuss this.

19:31.509 --> 19:33.965
Chuny, let's repeat a BP, please.

19:36.764 --> 19:40.133
- Mrs. Lang, this is Dr. Carter.
- How do you do, Mrs. Lang?

19:40.310 --> 19:42.551
I've just been going over your chart.

19:42.770 --> 19:46.222
- I see your husband has-
- I couldn't wake Bill up this morning.

19:46.440 --> 19:51.353
He was diagnosed 14 months ago
with brainstem glioblastoma.

19:51.572 --> 19:54.822
They tried to do radiation therapy.
But that didn't work.

19:55.033 --> 19:59.529
He's had some visual disturbances
and some paralysis.

19:59.747 --> 20:02.155
But we were not expecting this.

20:02.458 --> 20:04.284
We'll do everything that we can.

20:04.668 --> 20:06.827
Let's order an MRl with gadolinium.

20:07.004 --> 20:10.919
Get in a Neurosurgery consult and
the Oncology Fellow on call.

20:11.176 --> 20:13.844
I hope it's okay
that we opened the window.

20:14.052 --> 20:16.805
Bill, he just loves the smell
of the rain.

20:17.014 --> 20:18.592
That's fine, Mrs. Lang.

20:20.643 --> 20:22.850
Last time I complain about
kids in shopping carts.

20:23.021 --> 20:24.894
- What?
- Never mind.

20:26.358 --> 20:28.149
- Oh, hi, Adele.
- Hey, Carol.

20:28.359 --> 20:31.029
This is Vicki McNeal.
This is Josh McNeal's mother.

20:31.237 --> 20:33.195
Baby Josh, right.

20:33.407 --> 20:36.324
- Hi.
- She'd like to see her son.

20:36.535 --> 20:37.566
- Thanks.
- Dr. Benton.

20:37.786 --> 20:40.538
- Randi, an audiologist is gonna call.
- An "audi"- what?

20:40.705 --> 20:42.330
Hearing tests. Write it down.

20:42.541 --> 20:46.242
But we've got an MVA coming in.
A Mazda versus a milk truck.

20:46.461 --> 20:48.370
I'm just signing charts.

20:48.589 --> 20:53.251
But I can't find Dr. Corday. Upstairs
says she's checking out Costa Rica.

20:53.469 --> 20:56.041
- What?
- That's what I said. About the MVA?

20:56.263 --> 20:57.544
Oh, damn it.

20:59.099 --> 21:02.350
- Dumar, what do we have?
- Sam Wiser, 32. Head-on TC.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.888
Head, neck and abdominal trauma.

21:05.106 --> 21:08.854
- Did she ask about consent?
- I don't know what Adele told her.

21:10.570 --> 21:11.851
Ms. McNeal.

21:12.071 --> 21:13.863
Is he gonna be all right?

21:14.407 --> 21:17.942
Well, he's stable. His blood
pressure's holding steady.

21:18.161 --> 21:22.242
He's sleepy. But it's expected after
a prolonged sedation and intubation.

21:22.457 --> 21:23.536
Intubation?

21:23.708 --> 21:25.915
A tube down his throat
to help him breathe.

21:26.128 --> 21:27.919
He was asleep while they did it.

21:28.380 --> 21:31.251
I explained to Vicki about
the ultrarapid detox.

21:31.759 --> 21:33.917
How the drugs'll be out of his system.

21:34.094 --> 21:36.252
So he'll be able to sit up
like other kids.

21:36.472 --> 21:38.595
We believe he'll be able to catch up.

21:38.765 --> 21:41.683
The procedure went well.
We just have to wait and see.

21:44.188 --> 21:47.557
So what I wanted to know then,
Dr. Ross, is...

21:48.734 --> 21:51.568
...could you do the same thing for me?

22:02.368 --> 22:03.779
I'm gonna kill you!

22:03.995 --> 22:06.153
Why? You offered.
You get my patty melt?

22:06.371 --> 22:07.783
Yes, I got your patty melt.

22:07.998 --> 22:12.458
Hey, will you help this gentleman?
He's looking for Dr. Weaver.

22:12.669 --> 22:13.749
Sir?

22:14.630 --> 22:17.915
- Can I help you?
- Yes. I'm looking for Dr. Weaver.

22:18.133 --> 22:19.295
Dr. Weaver?

22:19.509 --> 22:23.886
- Mr. Wass, what are you doing back?
- I couldn't get the enoxaparin.

22:24.097 --> 22:27.097
It's $500.
My insurance won't cover it.

22:27.266 --> 22:30.885
They'll only cover something called
heparin or Coumadin.

22:31.104 --> 22:32.894
- Coumadin.
- I should be on that?

22:33.104 --> 22:37.102
You need to be hospitalized for those.
I'll call the insurance company.

22:37.317 --> 22:41.398
Can you get Mr. Wass' insurance
information and put a call in, please?

22:41.614 --> 22:45.445
Carol, you know, I had a meeting
with Dr. Anspaugh this morning.

22:45.659 --> 22:49.739
There will be an executive committee
review of the Josh McNeal case.

22:49.912 --> 22:50.944
Doug told me.

22:51.163 --> 22:54.781
It'd be in your best interest
to document your participation...

22:55.000 --> 22:56.578
...while it's still fresh.

22:56.795 --> 22:59.878
Oh, that experience isn't
going away anytime soon.

23:00.089 --> 23:02.758
You should hope neither you
nor Doug Ross is either.

23:02.967 --> 23:05.088
Dr. Weaver? Mr. Wass' insurance?

23:05.301 --> 23:06.583
Thank you.

23:06.970 --> 23:09.425
Yeah, Dr. Weaver. No. No, no, no.

23:09.639 --> 23:12.925
I don't want the claims department.
I need a medical supervisor.

23:13.352 --> 23:14.595
Mrs. Lang?

23:15.394 --> 23:17.886
MRl is backed up.
It'll be a little while longer.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.478
I've got Nurse Hathaway checking.

23:21.275 --> 23:23.648
He is gonna wake up, isn't he?

23:23.986 --> 23:25.859
His doctors thought we had longer.

23:26.071 --> 23:29.819
We really won't know anything until
we get those test results back.

23:30.992 --> 23:34.160
Is there a phone here?
I want to call my daughter.

23:34.371 --> 23:36.077
She's a freshman in college.

23:36.288 --> 23:38.578
Tulane Drama School.

23:38.791 --> 23:42.955
She didn't want to go because of
her dad. But Bill, he insisted.

23:43.170 --> 23:46.585
He said that it was enough that
his life was being put on hold.

23:46.798 --> 23:48.044
I don't know.

23:48.551 --> 23:50.460
Maybe we made a mistake.

23:56.516 --> 23:58.010
Looks like an avocado.

23:58.185 --> 23:59.347
Dr. Corday.

23:59.560 --> 24:00.890
Sorry I'm late.

24:03.523 --> 24:06.725
You were on trauma call when
Mr. Wiser was brought in.

24:06.942 --> 24:10.145
Dr. Benton was kind enough to cover
while I was away.

24:10.362 --> 24:12.189
You've reviewed the chart?

24:12.364 --> 24:15.863
- Avulsed gallbladder.
- Can I get some suction here, please?

24:18.328 --> 24:21.448
Let's say you find a significant
pancreatic injury.

24:21.665 --> 24:25.448
Crushed duodenum and common
bile duct. What are you going to do?

24:25.668 --> 24:27.707
A Whipple, which as you know...

24:27.878 --> 24:31.045
...I performed solo back in England
prior to my fellowship.

24:31.257 --> 24:32.965
Yes. I think I did know that.

24:33.175 --> 24:35.382
Speaking of fellowships,
can I ask you...

24:35.595 --> 24:38.713
...about the possibility of
sponsorship for next year.

24:38.889 --> 24:40.927
What about Dr. Romano?

24:41.140 --> 24:44.972
It seems Dr. Romano doesn't wish
to continue with me.

24:45.186 --> 24:46.301
What?

24:46.647 --> 24:48.057
He served me notice today.

24:48.231 --> 24:52.893
And he's unavailable at some head-
and-neck conference in Costa Rica.

24:53.069 --> 24:56.901
It's too late to arrange another
fellowship at County General.

24:57.073 --> 24:58.781
We're past application deadlines.

24:58.991 --> 25:01.659
I was hoping for individual
consideration...

25:01.868 --> 25:03.862
...since I've spent a year here.

25:04.080 --> 25:06.748
The committee always
seems to frown on that.

25:06.915 --> 25:10.497
- You really want to stay in the US?
- Very much so, yes.

25:10.710 --> 25:13.581
If it's staying in America,
you could marry an American.

25:14.631 --> 25:17.168
- Shirley.
- Sorry, Dr. Anspaugh.

25:17.592 --> 25:19.251
Your guidelines are wrong.

25:19.468 --> 25:24.130
He needs anticoagulation therapy.
And he doesn't need to be admitted.

25:24.348 --> 25:25.841
- Dr. Weaver.
- What is it?

25:26.057 --> 25:27.967
The renal failure guy's here.

25:28.185 --> 25:30.058
Okay. I'll be there when I can.

25:30.270 --> 25:34.731
You know, I would like to get your
name. Rufhauer? Rufhauer.

25:34.942 --> 25:39.401
Louis Palmieri, 84. End-stage renal
failure. Full cardiopulmonary arrest.

25:39.611 --> 25:42.696
His femoral dialysis catheter
had been disconnected.

25:42.906 --> 25:45.742
- Sheets were drenched with blood.
- Will he be okay?

25:45.952 --> 25:47.444
Would you stand back please?

25:47.661 --> 25:51.279
No pulse or heart sounds. Intubated.
Two amps epi, two of atropine.

25:51.457 --> 25:54.742
Reattached saline to the catheter,
two liters. That does it.

25:54.918 --> 25:55.950
- No pulse?
- No.

25:56.169 --> 25:59.205
Amp of bicarb and a high-dose epi,
five milligrams.

25:59.422 --> 26:02.707
- Please be okay, Louis, huh?
- No heart sounds. He's PEA.

26:02.925 --> 26:04.751
Spin a crit and four units O-neg.

26:04.969 --> 26:07.127
- Try a transthoracic pacemaker?
- Yes.

26:07.304 --> 26:08.715
- What?
- Getting his heart going.

26:10.015 --> 26:12.138
- Turn up the gain.
- You a relative?

26:12.559 --> 26:14.516
- Not exactly.
- It's not capturing.

26:14.728 --> 26:16.270
- You did come with him.
- Yeah.

26:16.480 --> 26:18.307
I drop by his house every week.

26:21.609 --> 26:25.476
Mrs. Lang? Your husband's
MRl results are done.

26:27.114 --> 26:29.985
The tumor is blocking his...

26:30.659 --> 26:33.411
It's a blockage that's increasing
intracranial pressure.

26:34.996 --> 26:37.749
- And that's causing the coma?
- Yes.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.494
So can it be unblocked?

26:39.667 --> 26:43.286
Yes. A neurosurgeon can perform
a ventriculostomy.

26:43.504 --> 26:45.876
So Bill could come out of this?

26:46.173 --> 26:47.454
He could.

26:50.344 --> 26:52.004
The outcome is problematic.

26:55.474 --> 26:57.680
Your husband would have
very little time.

26:58.519 --> 27:01.354
And it may cause him
a great deal of pain.

27:01.855 --> 27:04.428
He would most likely die
of respiratory failure.

27:04.650 --> 27:06.440
But Bill would wake up?

27:07.026 --> 27:10.229
I mean, I could talk to him again
and he could hear me?

27:10.446 --> 27:11.609
Yes.

27:13.533 --> 27:16.865
Or he could stay the way he is
now and die peacefully.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.874
- She wants to handle the funeral?
- He has no family.

27:24.043 --> 27:26.450
- What's her relationship?
- Friend.

27:26.878 --> 27:29.548
- She looks like a hooker.
- She is.

27:29.715 --> 27:32.040
She's been "attending" him
twice a week.

27:32.217 --> 27:35.134
- Did you say he had a Foley catheter?
- Yes.

27:35.344 --> 27:38.095
- Excuse me, Miss...?
- Myra.

27:38.305 --> 27:42.055
Miss Myra. I wonder if you could
tell me exactly what happened.

27:42.268 --> 27:47.013
I've been seeing Mr. Palmieri twice
a week for the past couple of years.

27:47.231 --> 27:51.560
It wasn't a lot of money. But then
I was only providing manual relief.

27:52.361 --> 27:55.646
But today my bracelet here got
caught on that little tube.

27:55.864 --> 27:57.986
When I pulled back, it popped out.

27:58.199 --> 28:01.069
The next thing I know is,
there's blood everywhere.

28:01.284 --> 28:04.120
- So I called 911 right away.
- I see.

28:04.330 --> 28:07.533
Dr. Weaver, some insurance company's
on the phone.

28:07.750 --> 28:09.907
I'll be right there. Excuse me.

28:11.086 --> 28:13.079
I say give her the body.

28:13.296 --> 28:16.582
You were here a little while ago
talking to Dr. Greene.

28:16.799 --> 28:17.879
Yeah.

28:18.051 --> 28:22.094
Have you seen a vial of Percocet?
I lost it around the drug lock-up.

28:22.304 --> 28:24.843
No, I haven't.
But I'll keep my eyes open.

28:26.100 --> 28:29.848
- there's always a pile of these.
Now I gotta pore over these.

28:30.062 --> 28:33.098
Went through the last two weeks.
You guys do a lot of kids.

28:33.273 --> 28:36.273
- Elizabeth.
- I haven't much time right now.

28:36.484 --> 28:39.770
- I'm trying to catch Langstaff.
- Langstaff?

28:39.947 --> 28:42.402
I've heard she isn't too keen
on her Fellow.

28:42.615 --> 28:45.190
Thinking of letting him go.
I want to get a word in.

28:45.410 --> 28:48.411
Well, shouldn't you wait to see
if she does let him go?

28:48.622 --> 28:50.946
I want to let her know I'm available.

28:51.124 --> 28:52.452
And desperate.

28:52.667 --> 28:53.911
Excuse me?

28:54.126 --> 28:57.625
I mean, asking Dr. Anspaugh
in the middle of an operation?

28:57.796 --> 29:01.379
- He didn't seem put off. Why're you?
- I'm not put off.

29:01.633 --> 29:06.212
If it's about me hanging you up,
I'm sorry. I appreciate you covering.

29:06.430 --> 29:07.923
I wasn't hung up. Yeah...

29:08.139 --> 29:12.137
...I would've appreciated a page
letting me know about Romano's letter.

29:13.185 --> 29:15.474
Look, I would have discussed it
with you.

29:15.688 --> 29:20.480
Romano was my first priority. That
bastard didn't even give me a reason.

29:20.650 --> 29:24.944
He's not required to. He sponsored
you. I mean, it's his call.

29:25.697 --> 29:27.441
You're taking this in stride.

29:27.782 --> 29:30.320
It's not necessarily about you.

29:30.535 --> 29:32.362
It's very much about me.

29:32.579 --> 29:34.950
You don't know how hard
I worked to get here.

29:35.164 --> 29:38.498
- I do know what it takes.
- Then why aren't you being supportive?

29:38.710 --> 29:40.417
You're doing it the wrong way.

29:40.627 --> 29:43.748
You're running all over, asking
every surgeon to sponsor you.

29:43.964 --> 29:45.292
So, what do you suggest?

29:45.924 --> 29:49.257
You haven't checked out other
hospitals, other parts of the country.

29:50.512 --> 29:53.347
I've built up relationships here.
Or so I thought.

29:54.058 --> 29:56.512
I'm not saying I want you
to leave Chicago.

29:56.684 --> 29:59.685
No. But you're not passionate
about my fight to stay.

29:59.896 --> 30:02.101
- Whatever goes on between us-
- Peter.

30:02.355 --> 30:05.109
You ready to scrub on
that small bowel infarction?

30:05.277 --> 30:06.307
Yes, sir.

30:15.536 --> 30:19.200
Please let me finish. You understand
that admitting the patient-

30:19.371 --> 30:21.365
- I need you to sign.
- I'm not working.

30:21.582 --> 30:24.287
- These are from yesterday.
- I'm not working.

30:24.502 --> 30:26.375
Josh McNeal is doing much better.

30:26.587 --> 30:28.544
You didn't tell me about the meeting-

30:28.756 --> 30:32.207
No! I mean, your policy
is not sound, Dr. Stork.

30:32.384 --> 30:36.299
It's obscene. I mean, you're
spending 10,000 to save 500!

30:36.721 --> 30:40.386
Then so be it! I will admit
Mr. Wass to this hospital!

30:40.600 --> 30:44.644
And I look forward to billing you for
every damn dime we can possibly spend!

30:44.854 --> 30:47.142
- Admit Mr. Wass.
- Want me to call them?

30:47.356 --> 30:49.812
- That'll help.
- I don't know what helps anymore.

30:50.026 --> 30:52.564
- I don't care. Because I quit.
- What?

30:52.779 --> 30:56.526
I quit as Acting Chief of Emergency.
Let somebody else "act. "

30:56.699 --> 30:57.729
Wait.

30:57.950 --> 31:01.235
Why am I the only idiot
who's worrying about policy?

31:01.411 --> 31:05.574
Doug's got the right idea. Break
the rules if it helps the patient.

31:05.749 --> 31:09.247
Everything else be damned! Where do I
get by trying to follow them?

31:09.459 --> 31:11.417
- Look, Kerry, wait.
- No!

31:11.754 --> 31:14.505
- If anybody needs me, I'm outside.
- Cool.

31:23.390 --> 31:24.422
Hey.

31:24.642 --> 31:26.882
- Hey, Carter.
- Getting some air?

31:27.102 --> 31:30.934
- Yeah. I need it after my last case.
- Yeah. Me too.

31:35.441 --> 31:37.768
I was just talking to Lydia Wright.

31:37.987 --> 31:40.145
And she mentioned to me...

31:40.365 --> 31:43.614
...that some Percocet's been
missing from the drug lock-up.

31:44.535 --> 31:47.488
- That's low, Carter.
- Hey, I'm not accusing anybody.

31:47.704 --> 31:49.863
You're my friend.
I want you to know.

31:50.081 --> 31:51.279
Well, Max is clean.

31:51.791 --> 31:54.709
- Well, maybe he is. But-
- But what?

31:55.129 --> 31:57.119
That's what Chase used to say to me.

31:59.090 --> 32:00.635
I gotta get back.

32:09.586 --> 32:11.958
Vitals are stable. The boy's alert.

32:12.172 --> 32:14.165
You got your next journal article.

32:14.382 --> 32:18.462
Right after they draw and quarter me
in front of the committee. Thank you.

32:18.678 --> 32:21.430
We don't always get results
this good up here.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.929
I'm going to go check
on the Yezerski kid.

32:24.850 --> 32:26.891
What will happen? Back to his mother?

32:27.104 --> 32:30.058
Who knows? I gave her a list
of names of doctors...

32:30.274 --> 32:32.811
...who do ultrarapid detox on adults.

32:33.026 --> 32:36.192
But it doesn't change
the psychological addiction.

32:36.404 --> 32:38.196
At least she's trying.

32:38.782 --> 32:40.062
Come on, buddy.

32:41.618 --> 32:45.485
- I was just coming to look for you.
- You knocking off already?

32:45.705 --> 32:49.204
Going to St. Mark's to see how
their unit's doing. When you off?

32:49.375 --> 32:52.459
- Seven.
- Want to get dinner at Johnny D's?

32:52.628 --> 32:53.957
Yeah, sure.

32:54.547 --> 32:57.299
Feeling good about getting through
those charts?

32:57.634 --> 33:01.299
Yeah, it'll be a week or two
before I can get a report out.

33:01.596 --> 33:04.051
If you can stand to have me
around that long.

33:04.265 --> 33:05.926
What's your recommendation?

33:06.143 --> 33:10.471
What happens when I recommend
in favor of an ER Pedes Department is...

33:11.272 --> 33:12.731
...they ask me to run it.

33:13.482 --> 33:18.275
I've always said no. But this time
I could be convinced to say yes.

33:20.114 --> 33:22.784
- You mean stay in Chicago?
- Only if you want me to.

33:23.910 --> 33:27.528
Wow. I hadn't really
thought that far ahead.

33:37.048 --> 33:39.088
Heard some Percocet was missing.

33:39.968 --> 33:41.675
Yeah. I heard that too.

33:42.762 --> 33:44.173
I didn't take it.

33:44.680 --> 33:46.424
I didn't suspect that you did.

33:47.392 --> 33:49.348
You'd be crazy not to.

33:51.563 --> 33:54.184
I didn't want to suspect
that you did, anyway.

33:55.400 --> 33:57.476
Don't feel bad about it.

34:00.864 --> 34:03.984
I know I've used up all
my free passes with you.

34:04.200 --> 34:05.943
But I'm telling you the truth.

34:07.662 --> 34:09.571
And I'm willing to prove it.

34:11.083 --> 34:12.541
Every day.

34:14.210 --> 34:16.369
It's not that I don't believe you.

34:16.545 --> 34:18.289
- It's just-
- Anna?

34:18.880 --> 34:22.002
- Labs are back on that Ml.
- Thanks. I'll be right there.

34:23.886 --> 34:28.134
All right, go. Be a doctor.
I'll call you later.

34:29.809 --> 34:30.840
Sure.

34:33.605 --> 34:35.183
Where's Mr. and Mrs. Lang?

34:35.399 --> 34:37.804
Mark signed a transfer
to White Memorial.

34:38.025 --> 34:40.647
- Why White Memorial?
- Maybe his doctor's there.

34:40.862 --> 34:43.732
- Will they do the ventriculostomy?
- She didn't say.

34:43.947 --> 34:46.521
Did you tell her
there wasn't much they could do?

34:46.742 --> 34:49.114
Just would've liked to know
what she chose.

34:49.329 --> 34:51.404
- Why?
- Why?

34:52.498 --> 34:55.748
I don't know.
Just seems unsettled. Unfinished.

34:55.960 --> 34:58.582
We never know about people
when they leave.

35:00.923 --> 35:03.130
You haven't seen Anna around,
have you?

35:03.301 --> 35:04.332
No.

35:06.346 --> 35:07.970
- There it goes again.
- What?

35:08.181 --> 35:12.225
That car alarm. It keeps starting up
and shutting off, and starting up.

35:12.435 --> 35:14.510
- Annoying.
- It's in the ambulance bay.

35:14.728 --> 35:17.564
I called Security.
But who knows where they ever are?

35:17.773 --> 35:21.522
Mark, Kerry, this is the action
report on Josh McNeal.

35:21.735 --> 35:23.528
Like maybe why you lied to me?

35:23.739 --> 35:26.775
- You didn't understand.
- You didn't give me a chance.

35:26.992 --> 35:29.363
Take it outside. We got work to do.

35:29.577 --> 35:34.073
If you're no longer Acting Chief,
who do I give these budget reviews to?

35:34.248 --> 35:35.279
I'll take them.

35:35.458 --> 35:37.415
This kid was more important.

35:37.627 --> 35:39.454
You always have a patient excuse.

35:39.670 --> 35:41.295
I'm willing to go out on a limb.

35:41.506 --> 35:45.124
You took the whole tree with you.
I was trying to support you.

35:45.342 --> 35:48.759
To be the Pedes Attending?
You weren't going to support me.

35:48.971 --> 35:52.009
We'll never know now, because
you did what you always do.

35:52.224 --> 35:55.640
When you're about to get what
you want, you sabotage it.

35:55.853 --> 35:59.981
- Is that what you're so angry about?
- I'm not angry. I'm disappointed.

36:00.149 --> 36:04.811
You like that. It validates that
you're the adult and I'm the screw-up.

36:04.988 --> 36:06.647
You never wanted to grow up.

36:06.865 --> 36:09.901
You like it this way.
We hang out, but you're the boss.

36:10.117 --> 36:11.992
For good reason,
based on your actions.

36:12.162 --> 36:14.866
Based on your inability
to see me as an equal, Mark.

36:15.081 --> 36:17.654
- Bad enough Kerry stepped up.
- I support her.

36:17.875 --> 36:20.413
On the surface.
Underneath, you resented her.

36:20.628 --> 36:22.668
Like you resent what I did with Josh.

36:22.839 --> 36:24.997
Where's Mark? He needs to sign this.

36:25.216 --> 36:28.252
He and Dr. Ross are outside "sharing. "

36:31.723 --> 36:34.474
Mr. Nable? What are you doing here?

36:34.976 --> 36:37.680
Mr. Nable, are you hurt?
Are you okay?

36:37.853 --> 36:40.060
Come on. Come with me. Come on.

36:42.358 --> 36:43.852
I'm so sorry.

36:44.484 --> 36:46.609
Where's all this blood from,
Mr. Nable?

36:46.821 --> 36:49.028
Come this way.
I'm gonna check you over.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.197
You just sit down right here.

36:55.288 --> 36:58.988
That's my car. The alarm's always
doing that. I don't know why.

36:59.209 --> 37:03.372
You drove here? We'll get someone
to turn that alarm off for you.

37:03.546 --> 37:05.170
Do you have a remote button?

37:07.008 --> 37:08.715
Oh, God.

37:08.884 --> 37:11.126
- There weren't enough bullets.
- All right.

37:12.346 --> 37:15.216
Jeanie, stay with Mr. Nable.
Just be careful.

37:15.432 --> 37:17.141
- Stick this somewhere.
- Cripes.

37:17.351 --> 37:19.391
And call Security to help Jeanie.

37:19.603 --> 37:21.644
Doug, Mark, come on! The car!

37:24.025 --> 37:25.566
Come on!

37:29.321 --> 37:30.353
- What is it?
- Locked.

37:30.572 --> 37:33.490
- Who's in here?
- Can you see anyone?

37:33.700 --> 37:36.072
- I can't see.
- Something's in the back seat.

37:37.079 --> 37:39.570
- It's two kids!
- I'll break a window!

37:46.505 --> 37:49.127
Woman in the front,
two kids in the back!

37:49.341 --> 37:51.548
Hit the latch!
The door won't open!

37:53.888 --> 37:55.845
Got it! Jerry!

37:56.308 --> 38:01.265
Get us three gurneys, backboards,
and head collars! Get some help too!

38:01.479 --> 38:05.559
I got a 40-year-old woman.
Gunshot wound to the left neck.

38:05.774 --> 38:08.099
Weak carotid pulse!
She's barely breathing!

38:08.319 --> 38:11.236
13-year-old.
Looks like a GSW to the abdomen.

38:11.447 --> 38:13.107
- What's going on?
- Ambulance bay.

38:13.324 --> 38:15.732
- Get those out there.
- I got the flashlight.

38:15.951 --> 38:18.193
- Everyone use blood precaution!
- What is it?

38:18.412 --> 38:20.867
Get outside and help.
Lydia, call for O-neg.

38:21.081 --> 38:22.196
- How much?
-15 units.

38:22.416 --> 38:24.954
- Close us to Trauma, page Surgery.
- Kerry.

38:25.127 --> 38:26.705
- Wait.
- No. This is the guy.

38:26.921 --> 38:29.673
- What guy?
- What happened outside. Mr. Nable...

38:29.883 --> 38:31.625
Okay. Call Security now.

38:31.842 --> 38:34.759
Move him to Curtain 3.
Post someone at the door. Yosh?

38:35.262 --> 38:37.220
Help Jeanie with this man.

38:37.432 --> 38:40.349
- Jerry, push the gurney closer!
- C-collar's secure!

38:40.560 --> 38:43.264
- Anything else I can do?
- Yes! Help lift her!

38:43.479 --> 38:44.559
Watch her head!

38:44.773 --> 38:46.979
- Gently! Gently!
- All right, we got her!

38:47.191 --> 38:50.476
- Get her legs. I'll support her neck.
- I'm underneath her.

38:50.653 --> 38:52.978
- Supports are in!
- Mommy! Where's my mommy?!

38:53.197 --> 38:55.604
- It's okay, honey!
- Slide her out really slow!

38:55.782 --> 38:56.814
Get this side!

38:57.034 --> 38:58.445
- Got it!
- Weak carotid pulse.

38:58.661 --> 39:02.492
Flat neck veins. Decent respiratory
effort. Trachea midline.

39:02.665 --> 39:05.286
- I got the backboard!
- We'll roll him. Roll him.

39:05.501 --> 39:06.781
- Nice and easy.
- Slide it.

39:07.002 --> 39:08.912
Let's move him back.

39:09.129 --> 39:11.799
Malik! Give me a hand!
Top of the board!

39:12.008 --> 39:13.121
On my count. One!

39:13.300 --> 39:14.332
- Go!
- Two!

39:14.510 --> 39:15.625
Three.

39:15.929 --> 39:16.959
Three.

39:17.179 --> 39:18.507
- Start a line.
- Which one?

39:18.723 --> 39:19.920
Little girl.

39:21.517 --> 39:25.349
Good breath sounds on the left.
A few crackles at the right base.

39:25.562 --> 39:30.188
I'm Dr. Weaver. We'll take good care
of you. What's your name, sweetie?

Amy.

39:32.487 --> 39:36.021

Oh, man!

39:52.506 --> 39:54.333

- We're going to help you.

39:54.507 --> 39:58.588
Doctors are helping your kids. We'll
tell you as soon as we know anything.

39:58.804 --> 40:01.840

Send pre-op labs. We need X-ray
in here for a portable C-spine.

40:19.199 --> 40:22.069
Dr. Benton, a Jackson Kroopf's
on the phone for you.

40:22.286 --> 40:24.492
- Who?
- Something about a hearing test.

40:24.706 --> 40:27.540
- I'll call him back.
- Carotid's okay, what about yours?

40:27.708 --> 40:31.706
Strong. It missed the major vessels.
Any sub-q air on your side?

40:31.880 --> 40:35.378
No. Tube went straight in.
Trachea's intact. What's her name?

40:35.549 --> 40:37.376
Husband's name is Nable.

40:37.551 --> 40:38.880
Mrs. Nable...

40:39.052 --> 40:40.677
...can you squeeze my hand?

40:42.139 --> 40:44.464
That was good. Try again.

40:46.059 --> 40:49.226
- X-ray's here. Where's Mark?
- Next door.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.687
The police are here.
Mr. Nable needs to be cleared.

40:54.860 --> 40:55.892
In a minute.

40:56.112 --> 40:58.733

Be nice to know.

41:01.450 --> 41:04.154

41:26.225 --> 41:29.428

41:29.603 --> 41:31.429
They're working on him right now.

41:32.564 --> 41:34.603
I turned the gun...

41:36.109 --> 41:38.185
There weren't anymore bullets.

41:40.948 --> 41:43.486
- I need a chest tube.
- What are you doing?

41:43.701 --> 41:45.075
There's a hemopneumo.

41:45.285 --> 41:49.153
Wound's in the seventh intercostal
space. It may be intra-abdominal.

41:49.372 --> 41:51.946
- May not need chest tube.
- Exam indicates hemopneumo.

41:52.125 --> 41:54.961
She's stable.
Lydia, let's get an x-ray.

41:55.128 --> 41:56.837
I don't think she's too stable.

41:57.047 --> 41:59.965
- Does it hurt anywhere else?
- Take my hand, sweetheart.

42:00.134 --> 42:03.467
- Are my mom and my brother okay?
- They're taking care of them.

42:03.637 --> 42:06.756
I thought we'd drive here and
everything would be okay.

42:06.974 --> 42:09.974
- I know.
- Why did my daddy have a gun?

42:10.143 --> 42:13.726
My mom said we'd go with him
if he came here to talk to somebody.

42:13.939 --> 42:15.054
It's okay.

42:15.274 --> 42:17.645
I thought we'd just talk to somebody.

42:22.948 --> 42:25.024
- Prime the lines.
- Satinsky. Suction.

42:25.243 --> 42:26.272

42:27.702 --> 42:30.407
A hole in the heart.
Right ventricle.

42:30.622 --> 42:34.157
Keep your finger on it.
Line's in. Hook it up.

42:34.334 --> 42:36.742
2-0 silk on an atraumatic needle.

42:36.962 --> 42:39.535
- Rapid infuser ready.
- I'll occlude, you sew.

42:39.757 --> 42:42.330
Hold compression.
Put your finger on the defect.

42:42.509 --> 42:45.047
Don't stick me.
Chuny, we need more blood.

42:45.262 --> 42:46.886
Okay. Hold this.

42:49.350 --> 42:50.677
- How is she?
- She'll make it.

42:50.892 --> 42:54.012
But her spinal cord is injured.
Taking her to CT now.

42:54.229 --> 42:56.519

42:56.690 --> 42:58.683

- Waiting for us.

42:58.901 --> 43:00.525
You're gonna be okay, Amy.

43:00.735 --> 43:04.780
We're going to surgery.
We'll let you know how your family is.

43:04.990 --> 43:07.610
Tell the surgeon to call us
when he knows anything.

43:07.825 --> 43:09.819
- How's the boy?
- Still working on him.

43:12.915 --> 43:14.907
- Let's call that Psych Resident.
- I did.

43:15.125 --> 43:17.034
- He's coming back in.
- Great.

43:17.211 --> 43:20.994
She was gonna take
Amy and Steven with her.

43:22.257 --> 43:24.048
I couldn't let her do that.

43:25.844 --> 43:28.217
He's in V-fib. Internal paddles.

43:50.410 --> 43:52.533
Strong carotid pulse.
His name's Steven.

43:54.415 --> 43:58.199
Call the blood bank. Have them
send up eight units to the O.R.

43:58.418 --> 44:01.087
- I got it.
- Grab those lines. Help me bag him.

44:01.588 --> 44:03.829
Stat page the Thoracic surgeon.

44:04.048 --> 44:07.299

Tell them that we're on our way.

44:07.594 --> 44:09.883

44:20.066 --> 44:22.354
Secure subclavian and

Bag him at 24 a minute.
He's probably acidotic.

44:25.320 --> 44:28.333
Everybody ready?
All right, let's get him up.
