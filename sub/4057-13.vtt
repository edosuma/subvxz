WEBVTT

00:01.196 --> 00:02.602
Previously on Teen Wolf.

00:02.653 --> 00:04.097
Where would I even start?

00:04.136 --> 00:05.721
"Sorry for trying to kill you"?

00:05.756 --> 00:06.723
I feel like I lost something.

00:06.757 --> 00:09.358
Then maybe you start by
forgiving someone else.

00:09.392 --> 00:10.960
Someone like Scott.

00:10.994 --> 00:13.395
If Theo's got his own
pack now, then we need ours.

00:13.430 --> 00:15.264
Skinwalkers are
powerful shapeshifters.

00:16.300 --> 00:17.700
They'll find us.

00:17.734 --> 00:20.102
Kira, take out your sword.

01:48.053 --> 01:49.686
She's frightened.

01:49.721 --> 01:50.987
But she's not frightened of us.

01:51.488 --> 01:53.090
Of herself.

01:53.124 --> 01:54.124
Can you help her?

01:58.229 --> 01:59.462
We can try.

01:59.496 --> 02:01.397
If not, she stays.

02:04.635 --> 02:06.035
What... What does that mean?

02:06.069 --> 02:08.804
If we can't help you, you'll stay

02:08.839 --> 02:10.372
and become one of us.

02:10.406 --> 02:11.207
A Skinwalker.

02:11.241 --> 02:14.376
You'll walk with us under the sun

02:14.410 --> 02:15.444
through the dust.

02:17.247 --> 02:18.280
Forever.

03:42.727 --> 03:43.894
They're alive.

03:45.163 --> 03:46.263
I mean the Chimeras.

03:46.298 --> 03:47.931
Some of them, not all of them.

03:47.965 --> 03:49.398
I know.

03:49.433 --> 03:50.433
Oh, you do?

03:50.667 --> 03:51.667
Yeah.

03:52.970 --> 03:55.404
I... I'm sorry, I can't
talk right now, Liam.

03:55.439 --> 03:57.240
It was Theo.

03:57.274 --> 04:00.543
He's the one who brought them
back, and now they're with him.

04:00.577 --> 04:01.577
Like they're his pack.

04:01.912 --> 04:03.046
I know.

04:05.982 --> 04:06.982
Hayden's one of them.

04:12.121 --> 04:13.322
She's okay?

04:13.356 --> 04:14.622
She's alive.

04:16.425 --> 04:18.125
I'm not sure she's totally okay,

04:18.161 --> 04:19.261
but she's definitely alive.

04:19.829 --> 04:20.963
That's good.

04:22.797 --> 04:23.998
Where are you guys going?

04:24.032 --> 04:25.233
To get Kira.

04:25.267 --> 04:27.468
Her dad told us that her mom
took her out to New Mexico,

04:27.502 --> 04:28.836
to this place called Shiprock.

04:28.871 --> 04:29.981
They're trying to figure out a way

04:30.005 --> 04:31.438
to help her, but it's dangerous.

04:32.774 --> 04:34.574
So we're gonna go find
her and bring her back.

04:35.344 --> 04:36.443
I'll come with you.

04:36.478 --> 04:37.578
Nah, you can't.

04:41.949 --> 04:42.949
Let me help.

04:45.019 --> 04:46.353
Let me do something.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.587
Just tell me what I can do.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.658
Don't do anything.

05:10.176 --> 05:11.176
So, what did he want?

05:13.045 --> 05:14.145
To help.

05:14.746 --> 05:16.114
You gonna let him?

05:16.681 --> 05:18.816
Eventually, I guess.

05:18.850 --> 05:22.053
Okay, but shouldn't he be a little
higher on your priority list right now?

05:22.087 --> 05:24.555
I mean, since he's the
only other actual werewolf,

05:24.589 --> 05:25.890
your only actual Beta.

05:25.925 --> 05:27.302
You didn't see the way that he came at me.

05:27.326 --> 05:29.160
You didn't see the look in his eyes.

05:29.194 --> 05:30.670
Well, I've been with you on a full moon,

05:30.694 --> 05:32.396
so I've seen that look.

05:33.464 --> 05:35.299
You want to get the band
back together, Scott,

05:35.333 --> 05:36.699
you don't leave out the drummer.

05:45.443 --> 05:46.443
Success!

05:47.077 --> 05:48.110
Yes!

05:58.455 --> 06:00.622
It's a minor leak. Very minor.

06:15.282 --> 06:16.481
Did you see it?

06:17.316 --> 06:19.050
It was too fast.

06:19.718 --> 06:21.052
But it's here?

06:22.488 --> 06:23.854
Yeah.

06:23.889 --> 06:25.323
So keep your distance.

06:26.925 --> 06:28.526
Look, we're not trying to catch it.

06:28.561 --> 06:29.994
Not yet.

06:44.442 --> 06:45.909
It's the same message, isn't it?

06:45.943 --> 06:47.777
What are they trying to tell it?

06:47.812 --> 06:49.913
Trying to get it to remember who it was.

06:49.947 --> 06:52.715
But isn't it just a teenager like us?

06:52.749 --> 06:54.584
Isn't it just a kid underneath?

06:54.618 --> 06:56.085
They don't care about that.

06:57.754 --> 06:59.021
The Doctors, they needed a body

06:59.055 --> 07:02.625
because they couldn't resurrect
the Beast out of thin air.

07:02.659 --> 07:07.096
That kid underneath, whoever
it is, just a side effect.

07:07.130 --> 07:08.796
All the Doctors care about is the Beast.

07:11.167 --> 07:13.201
So what happens if it does remember?

07:13.769 --> 07:14.969
I'm not sure.

07:16.305 --> 07:17.483
The thing probably doesn't even know

07:17.507 --> 07:20.442
it turns back to human during the day.

07:20.476 --> 07:23.612
I read that the Beast of
Gevaudan killed 113 people.

07:25.680 --> 07:26.913
Is that true?

07:27.949 --> 07:28.949
No.

07:31.986 --> 07:34.121
The Doctors told me it was closer to 500.

08:12.024 --> 08:13.124
Leave.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.326
Where is it?

08:14.360 --> 08:16.360
You already have your pack.

08:16.395 --> 08:17.761
It wasn't enough.

08:19.398 --> 08:21.199
Look at my eyes.

08:21.233 --> 08:22.766
They look red to you?

08:23.368 --> 08:24.669
I'm not an Alpha.

08:24.703 --> 08:26.304
I'm not even a real werewolf.

09:39.741 --> 09:41.940
This will speed the healing.

09:41.975 --> 09:43.735
You could've just not
thrown a spear into me.

09:44.645 --> 09:47.446
You had a sword. You could have used it.

09:47.481 --> 09:49.282
I thought I did.

09:49.316 --> 09:51.917
You were afraid to use the sword.

09:51.951 --> 09:54.186
I showed you I wasn't
afraid to use the spear.

10:23.348 --> 10:24.548
What happens now?

10:24.582 --> 10:25.622
They're going to test you.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.618
Tonight.

10:27.652 --> 10:29.720
It's not going to be easy.

10:29.754 --> 10:32.054
Have they mentioned
anything about fixing me?

10:32.088 --> 10:33.356
They have their methods.

10:34.725 --> 10:35.725
It takes time.

10:36.393 --> 10:38.795
How much time? Days?

10:42.666 --> 10:44.900
Months or years.

10:44.935 --> 10:46.536
Are you kidding?

10:46.570 --> 10:48.470
Don't think I take this lightly, Kira.

10:48.904 --> 10:50.505
Mom, years?

10:51.240 --> 10:52.374
You're a Kitsune.

10:54.009 --> 10:55.977
You have centuries.

10:56.011 --> 10:58.413
What about my friends? What about Scott?

10:58.448 --> 11:00.515
If this part of you becomes too powerful,

11:02.017 --> 11:03.852
it will consume you.

11:03.886 --> 11:06.053
Do you understand what that means?

11:06.087 --> 11:08.021
You won't even exist anymore.

11:08.056 --> 11:09.724
So this is it?

11:09.758 --> 11:11.692
This is all I've got?

11:11.727 --> 11:14.395
I pass their test and then
I can spend a couple months,

11:14.429 --> 11:16.230
or if I'm really lucky, years,

11:16.264 --> 11:17.875
learning from a couple
of crazy, half-naked women

11:17.899 --> 11:19.767
carrying spears and wearing animal pelts.

11:19.801 --> 11:20.968
You carry a sword

11:22.970 --> 11:24.537
and you wear a leather jacket.

11:26.440 --> 11:28.007
We're not so different from them.

11:28.041 --> 11:29.509
What if they can't help me?

11:32.312 --> 11:34.080
Do I really become one of them?

11:34.114 --> 11:35.882
If you become a Skinwalker

11:36.617 --> 11:38.184
and stay with them,

11:38.218 --> 11:39.818
it could keep you alive.

11:41.254 --> 11:42.688
It could be the only thing

11:42.722 --> 11:43.822
that saves you.

11:45.825 --> 11:47.745
All the myths about
Skinwalkers say they're evil.

11:50.663 --> 11:52.498
They say the same thing about Kitsune.

12:03.108 --> 12:04.809
Man, I think the Jeep's overheating again.

12:04.843 --> 12:05.843
Probably.

12:08.914 --> 12:10.874
Should we pull over and
put more antifreeze in it?

12:11.617 --> 12:13.583
No, we can just turn the heat on.

12:20.090 --> 12:21.090
You find anything yet?

12:21.926 --> 12:23.766
They're mostly the same
stuff you already knew.

12:25.029 --> 12:29.065
"Damnatio memoriae was a Roman practice,

12:29.099 --> 12:33.335
"a government decree to destroy
the images of the damned.

12:33.369 --> 12:36.071
"And they would scratch off
their names from inscriptions,

12:36.105 --> 12:37.465
"chisel their face off of statues.

12:39.375 --> 12:41.695
"The Romans believed it was a
punishment worse than death."

12:42.946 --> 12:44.079
Being forgotten.

12:45.549 --> 12:47.316
Listen to this.

12:47.350 --> 12:48.983
"Damnatio Memoriae, was later used

12:49.017 --> 12:52.654
"on a serial killer in 1598,
known as the Demon Tailor.

12:54.122 --> 12:56.157
"He lured children into his shop in Paris

12:56.191 --> 12:57.959
"where he would kill them

12:57.993 --> 13:00.462
"and boil the flesh off their bones to eat.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.598
"The courts believed
the crimes so horrible,

13:03.632 --> 13:06.166
"they ordered all the documents destroyed.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.335
"To this day, no one knows his real name."

13:08.369 --> 13:10.671
So the Dread Doctors resurrected a killer

13:10.705 --> 13:12.316
who was so bad that he had to literally be

13:12.340 --> 13:13.740
erased from history.

13:15.343 --> 13:17.478
A killer that became a werewolf.

13:17.512 --> 13:19.112
Which probably made him a better killer.

13:20.548 --> 13:21.581
That's great.

13:31.224 --> 13:32.959
Attention all students.

13:32.993 --> 13:35.528
Mr. O'Quinn's classes
are canceled for today.

13:35.562 --> 13:36.673
If anyone knows his whereabouts,

13:36.697 --> 13:38.964
please let the office know immediately.

13:38.998 --> 13:40.765
That doesn't sound too ominous.

13:45.337 --> 13:47.171
You said Scott told you not to do anything.

13:47.206 --> 13:48.206
I know.

13:50.743 --> 13:54.345
Liam, you said you
weren't gonna get involved.

13:55.714 --> 13:56.714
I know.

13:58.216 --> 14:02.620
Liam, don't get involved.

14:25.614 --> 14:26.854
You still not talking to Malia?

14:28.851 --> 14:30.551
Uh, she's not talking to me.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.622
Or anyone, I guess.

14:36.392 --> 14:37.658
I think I know why.

14:38.827 --> 14:39.987
I think she found her mother.

14:41.729 --> 14:43.089
Her mother, as in The Desert Wolf?

14:43.498 --> 14:44.831
Yeah.

14:47.502 --> 14:50.337
I knew she was still looking.

14:50.372 --> 14:51.838
She erased her name off my board,

14:51.873 --> 14:53.474
but I just... I knew she never stopped.

14:53.508 --> 14:55.442
When I was at her house,

14:55.477 --> 14:57.077
I'm pretty sure Braeden, was there, too.

14:57.677 --> 14:58.677
Braeden?

15:00.481 --> 15:02.048
What, did you catch her scent?

15:02.082 --> 15:03.483
Actually, it was her motorcycle.

15:04.251 --> 15:05.684
I smelled her exhaust.

15:08.822 --> 15:09.899
What the hell do you
think they're gonna do?

15:09.923 --> 15:12.325
Something that Malia doesn't
want to tell us about,

15:12.359 --> 15:14.859
so probably something bad.

15:15.761 --> 15:18.063
Oh, my God. You already know, don't you?

15:18.097 --> 15:19.777
It's like... It's the chemosignals, right?

15:22.868 --> 15:23.868
Aggression.

15:24.437 --> 15:26.238
How much?

15:26.272 --> 15:27.772
I think she's gonna kill her.

15:28.741 --> 15:30.108
She's gonna kill her mother.

15:34.112 --> 15:35.379
What's happening?

15:35.747 --> 15:37.048
Um...

15:38.250 --> 15:39.850
Yeah, we're out of gas. It's out of gas.

15:41.219 --> 15:42.263
It says we have half a tank.

15:42.287 --> 15:43.287
Yeah, not necessarily.

15:45.290 --> 15:46.667
You didn't fix the gas gauge, didn't you?

15:46.691 --> 15:47.691
Not necessarily.

15:53.364 --> 15:54.664
Co-dominance,

15:54.698 --> 15:56.066
a relationship among alleles

15:56.100 --> 15:58.334
where both alleles
contribute to the phenotype

15:58.369 --> 15:59.369
of the heterozygote.

15:59.970 --> 16:02.105
Quite a mouthful, I know,

16:02.139 --> 16:04.299
but it's exactly what we'll
be learning in today's lab.

16:05.808 --> 16:07.719
Students in the first and
third row, look behind you.

16:07.743 --> 16:08.910
These are your partners.

16:24.893 --> 16:27.562
Has anyone seen Stiles or Scott McCall?

16:27.596 --> 16:29.640
Can't be the only one who
thinks it's slightly coincidental

16:29.664 --> 16:31.031
they're both sick on the same day?

16:34.169 --> 16:37.572
And Lydia Martin wasn't
in class today either.

16:37.606 --> 16:38.872
She won't be in for a while.

16:43.444 --> 16:44.911
Medical issues.

17:43.301 --> 17:44.341
Do you know how he did it?

17:52.176 --> 17:55.110
He put the recorder in the
cup to amplify my voice.

17:55.145 --> 17:56.912
It didn't just amplify your voice.

17:57.714 --> 17:59.014
It gave it direction.

17:59.883 --> 18:00.916
Focus.

18:02.719 --> 18:06.655
Valack used your scream
as a tool by focusing it.

18:09.692 --> 18:12.694
If you're going to use it as a weapon,

18:12.728 --> 18:14.696
you need to learn to do the same.

18:15.364 --> 18:16.364
Same...

18:32.380 --> 18:33.914
Remember that in co-dominance,

18:33.948 --> 18:35.849
neither allele is recessive.

18:35.883 --> 18:38.418
The phenotypes of both
alleles are expressed.

18:38.452 --> 18:39.985
Corey, in human blood,

18:40.020 --> 18:42.322
what is a good example of co-dominance?
Type AB.

18:42.356 --> 18:43.389
Very good.

18:43.424 --> 18:45.425
So today you're going to
solve a little mystery.

18:45.459 --> 18:46.759
Two couples had babies

18:46.793 --> 18:49.529
on the same day in the same hospital.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.274
Were the babies switched? Open your packets

18:51.298 --> 18:52.365
and read the instructions.

19:01.574 --> 19:02.741
Gonna talk to me?

19:04.277 --> 19:05.437
I'm reading the instructions.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.347
You know what I mean.

19:08.381 --> 19:10.092
You mean how you're hanging
out with a total psycho

19:10.116 --> 19:11.260
that tried to get me to kill Scott

19:11.284 --> 19:12.550
and then did it himself?

19:14.085 --> 19:16.120
Yeah, okay, let's... Let's talk about that.

19:16.154 --> 19:18.256
That total psycho brought me back to life.

19:19.090 --> 19:20.090
Remember that?

19:21.159 --> 19:23.361
I'm not dying again. You don't have to...

19:23.395 --> 19:25.596
Why? Because Scott's gonna save us?

19:25.631 --> 19:26.974
He doesn't even know what's coming.

19:26.998 --> 19:29.032
What do you mean? What's coming?

19:29.067 --> 19:31.234
Seems to be a lot of discussion over here.

19:31.269 --> 19:33.550
Can't imagine you've already
solved the mystery, have you?

19:34.972 --> 19:36.873
No.

19:36.907 --> 19:37.940
Get to it.

19:41.746 --> 19:42.746
You want to go out again?

19:43.147 --> 19:44.213
Yeah.

19:45.182 --> 19:46.782
No. No way.

19:47.317 --> 19:48.584
Why not?

19:48.618 --> 19:50.519
You actually have to ask "why not?"

19:53.156 --> 19:54.423
You like me.

19:55.825 --> 19:57.293
Go out with me.

19:57.327 --> 19:58.994
But you're still with Theo.

19:59.028 --> 20:00.429
You... You're with the bad guys.

20:01.531 --> 20:03.398
There are no bad guys.

20:03.432 --> 20:06.167
There are definitely bad guys.

20:06.201 --> 20:09.404
Some of the bad guys
are called Dread Doctors.

20:09.438 --> 20:11.339
You don't get a name like Dread Doctors

20:11.373 --> 20:13.308
and not get classified as the bad guys.

20:13.342 --> 20:15.343
That's what none of you get.

20:15.377 --> 20:17.155
There aren't gonna be
any good guys or bad guys.

20:17.179 --> 20:18.646
It's either gonna be dead or alive.

20:19.848 --> 20:23.817
I want to be alive. Don't you?

20:23.851 --> 20:25.571
Not if I'm left standing with the bad guys.

20:28.389 --> 20:29.389
How about with me?

20:31.192 --> 20:33.393
Stay alive with me.

20:43.236 --> 20:44.236
Fine.

20:46.840 --> 20:48.907
But I'm not going out with you again.

21:06.325 --> 21:07.492
Probably not.

21:12.096 --> 21:13.697
We're gonna be okay.

21:13.732 --> 21:15.799
I know you probably don't believe it,

21:15.834 --> 21:17.394
but Theo is looking for the same thing.

21:18.236 --> 21:20.136
You mean the last Chimera.

21:20.171 --> 21:21.472
That's not what he's calling it.

21:22.707 --> 21:23.787
What is he calling it then?

21:24.909 --> 21:26.009
The Beast.

21:38.221 --> 21:39.355
You've already healed.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.727
Kira, you're going to be fine.

21:46.128 --> 21:47.629
Would you really leave me here?

21:48.297 --> 21:49.297
With them?

21:53.002 --> 21:55.236
If it's the only thing that
saves your life, then yes.

21:58.674 --> 22:00.174
What if I can't pass their test?

22:02.077 --> 22:03.243
What if I fail?

22:09.751 --> 22:11.018
Don't fail.

23:21.763 --> 23:22.796
Locked.

23:31.535 --> 23:32.535
You got a twenty?

24:08.342 --> 24:09.342
There was a pin.

24:11.979 --> 24:15.315
There was one little metal pin
attached to the scaffolding.

24:19.285 --> 24:20.919
He was trying to pull me down.

24:22.989 --> 24:24.789
He was trying to kill you.

24:24.824 --> 24:26.124
Yes, and then I pulled the pin.

24:27.526 --> 24:30.329
And all these metal braces came down.

24:32.631 --> 24:35.500
And one of them just, just
went right through him.

24:38.237 --> 24:39.797
Why didn't you think you could tell me?

24:43.641 --> 24:45.761
It was just the way you were
looking at me that night.

24:47.045 --> 24:49.123
You know, you're standing there
with a wrench in your hand,

24:49.147 --> 24:52.049
you're looking at me like

24:52.084 --> 24:54.450
I just bashed you in the head with it.

24:54.485 --> 24:57.020
You know, like I'd broken your sacred rule

24:57.054 --> 24:58.232
and that's it, there's no going back.

24:58.256 --> 24:59.289
I know the difference.

24:59.656 --> 25:00.656
What?

25:01.926 --> 25:03.293
I know what self-defense is.

25:49.637 --> 25:50.904
Our names are gone.

25:52.106 --> 25:53.307
Our initials.

25:57.211 --> 25:58.878
Not just you and your friends.

26:00.648 --> 26:01.814
Everyone.

26:03.116 --> 26:04.483
What am I supposed to do?

26:05.785 --> 26:07.219
How do I save them?

26:09.489 --> 26:10.656
Don't be afraid.

26:22.101 --> 26:23.101
No, don't!

26:34.947 --> 26:35.812
What the hell was that?

26:35.847 --> 26:37.181
Did you hear that?

26:38.916 --> 26:40.050
It came from Lydia's room.

26:45.790 --> 26:47.724
What did you hear? What was it exactly.

26:47.758 --> 26:50.494
I heard a kind of explosion.

26:50.528 --> 26:52.628
Before that. You know what I mean.

26:52.662 --> 26:53.762
A scream.

26:53.797 --> 26:55.198
I thought I heard her scream.

27:09.312 --> 27:10.645
Hey, Scott.

27:11.314 --> 27:12.314
Scott.

27:13.949 --> 27:14.949
Take a look at this.

27:23.493 --> 27:25.693
What the hell do you think's
happening to her out there?

29:24.036 --> 29:25.604
I don't know why I believed him.

29:27.507 --> 29:29.707
I don't know why we didn't
just keep talking that night.

29:30.376 --> 29:31.610
Five more minutes

29:33.646 --> 29:34.513
and we would've figured out

29:34.547 --> 29:36.415
that there were two different stories.

29:36.449 --> 29:37.849
We would've filled a lot of blanks.

29:40.285 --> 29:41.652
Should've just kept talking.

29:43.489 --> 29:44.622
He knew we wouldn't.

29:49.894 --> 29:51.562
I didn't want it to happen like this.

29:54.133 --> 29:55.633
- Like what?
- I knew,

29:56.534 --> 29:58.668
sooner or later, one of us

30:00.138 --> 30:02.258
was going to get a little
too much blood on our hands.

30:05.075 --> 30:06.843
I half thought it was gonna be Malia.

30:08.879 --> 30:11.248
Well, she definitely seems
like she's working on it.

30:13.550 --> 30:14.550
Just always thought that

30:16.919 --> 30:19.855
if it were to happen, then it should be me.

30:21.758 --> 30:24.126
I'm the one who's constantly
putting you guys in danger,

30:24.161 --> 30:27.663
risking your lives for
people you don't even know.

30:31.367 --> 30:32.667
It should've been me.

30:36.004 --> 30:38.072
Come on. We only got few hours to sunrise.

30:38.106 --> 30:39.106
Come on. Let's go.

30:43.078 --> 30:44.312
Hey, Stiles,

30:44.346 --> 30:45.346
do you see that?

30:48.015 --> 30:49.115
It's Kira.

31:32.124 --> 31:33.157
Aah!

33:31.036 --> 33:32.503
Can't find him, can you?

33:34.940 --> 33:36.540
Probably don't even know where to start.

33:38.343 --> 33:39.383
You're not gonna find him.

33:42.347 --> 33:44.067
Let's be honest, he's
probably already dead.

33:46.718 --> 33:48.084
I wonder what's gonna happen

33:48.118 --> 33:49.953
when Scott realizes that it's your fault.

34:01.365 --> 34:02.765
I should kill you.

34:02.799 --> 34:05.568
Yeah, but you won't. You like me too much.

34:13.376 --> 34:14.376
Aah!

34:32.659 --> 34:34.159
I let Stiles kick my ass, too.

34:35.563 --> 34:36.897
He never broke any bones.

34:41.402 --> 34:42.643
Look, I can help you find them.

34:43.737 --> 34:44.818
Deaton and The Desert Wolf.

34:46.607 --> 34:47.940
How?

34:48.509 --> 34:50.743
The Dread Doctors.

34:50.777 --> 34:52.378
I know how they found everyone.

35:38.556 --> 35:39.756
I won.

35:41.358 --> 35:43.025
I passed the test.

35:45.996 --> 35:47.096
Passed, yes.

35:48.065 --> 35:49.466
But not you.

35:50.501 --> 35:51.501
The Fox.

35:53.470 --> 35:54.770
What are you talking about?

35:55.872 --> 35:57.439
I beat it. I won.

35:59.075 --> 36:00.776
Now show me what I'm supposed to do.

36:00.810 --> 36:02.611
You wield the sword.

36:02.645 --> 36:04.145
But the Fox wields you.

36:09.318 --> 36:10.651
What the hell does that mean?

36:10.686 --> 36:12.854
It means you have no control.

36:12.888 --> 36:14.021
No hope.

36:14.055 --> 36:15.089
Without us.

36:16.391 --> 36:18.092
It means you will stay

36:19.661 --> 36:21.596
and become one of us.

36:39.113 --> 36:40.681
What are you doing?

36:41.883 --> 36:43.250
Trying not to get involved.

36:48.423 --> 36:50.023
Does that include me?

36:51.292 --> 36:52.725
Maybe.

36:55.929 --> 36:57.897
I know how you look up to Scott

36:59.132 --> 37:00.833
and how all of you feel about him.

37:02.603 --> 37:04.937
But he just can't protect
us the way Theo can.

37:09.942 --> 37:12.010
My sister...
Your sister's a Sheriff's Deputy,

37:13.613 --> 37:15.293
and she looks like she can handle herself.

37:16.015 --> 37:17.215
Not if I'm dead.

37:20.252 --> 37:22.621
She's not gonna be able
to handle that at all.

37:24.824 --> 37:26.924
I can't die again, Liam.

37:31.763 --> 37:32.763
Do you get it?

37:35.366 --> 37:36.767
It would ruin her.

37:41.606 --> 37:42.739
It would ruin me too.

38:28.016 --> 38:29.016
Mom?

38:31.252 --> 38:32.252
Mom.

38:43.598 --> 38:45.832
Kira, get in the car.

38:45.867 --> 38:47.801
What? Get in the car.

39:03.016 --> 39:04.383
She stays with us.

39:04.417 --> 39:06.819
I'm Kitsune of 900 years.

39:08.621 --> 39:09.621
You want her?

39:10.890 --> 39:12.123
You'll have to go through me.

39:28.039 --> 39:29.205
Get in.

39:34.445 --> 39:35.478
Come on.

39:36.881 --> 39:37.961
Come on, come on. Let's go.

39:46.089 --> 39:47.156
Come on, come on, come on.

39:58.068 --> 39:59.267
Everyone okay?

40:11.747 --> 40:12.747
You came back for me.

40:17.151 --> 40:18.719
I love you.

40:18.753 --> 40:19.753
I love you so much.

40:43.110 --> 40:45.712
Scott, wake up.

40:54.721 --> 40:56.521
What's wrong?

40:56.555 --> 40:57.875
I found out something from Corey.

40:59.058 --> 41:00.098
We know what Theo's doing.

41:01.460 --> 41:02.500
He's looking for an Alpha.

41:03.129 --> 41:04.162
A blind Alpha.

41:08.634 --> 41:09.634
Deucalion.
