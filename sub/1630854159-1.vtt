00:02.103 --> 00:05.573
<i>Previously on "The Rookie"...</i>
Sgt. Grey: Rosalind Dyer,
the most rare of unicorns--

00:05.606 --> 00:06.974
a female serial killer.

00:07.007 --> 00:09.410
Congratulations.
I underestimated you.

00:09.443 --> 00:12.146
Rosalind, you are never
going to walk free.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.582
Who are you supposed
to deliver the drugs to?
Roy Hajek.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.317
Wisco will give you
your cash on the way out.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.087
Or you could do
another job for me.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.654
And we'll need a driver,
so bring your old lady.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.190
Hello!

00:22.223 --> 00:24.425
If we're gonna sell
that we are, you know,

00:24.458 --> 00:25.659
actually boyfriend
and girlfriend,

00:25.693 --> 00:27.061
then we might have to...

00:28.062 --> 00:30.364
I just received
a formal request

00:30.398 --> 00:32.166
to temporarily assign you
to another station.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.235
That means I'll miss
my T.O. exam.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.604
The station you're going to is
four hours away, on the border.

00:51.985 --> 00:54.088
Good morning.

00:54.122 --> 00:56.424
What a beautiful day
for a trial.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.694
Oh.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.530
And who are you?

01:02.563 --> 01:05.466
Your shadow--
Deputy Suriel.

01:05.499 --> 01:08.035
I'll be with you every second
you're outside of this prison.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.470
Hmm.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.439
Well, then, I hope
you're good company.

01:11.472 --> 01:14.142
Oh, I'm great company--
if you're not my prisoner.

from the run.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.780
Surprise!
What?

01:52.813 --> 01:54.315
Happy birthday!

01:54.348 --> 01:56.950
Thank you.
But it is not my birthday.

01:56.984 --> 01:59.987
I know. It's your half birthday,
which is just as important.

02:00.020 --> 02:01.955
Oh, my God. Does that count
against my actual age?

02:01.989 --> 02:04.358
No. In fact...

02:04.392 --> 02:05.959
It was the only candle
they had at the store.

02:05.993 --> 02:08.862
Thank you.
This is so great.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.498
When did you even have time
to do this?

02:10.531 --> 02:12.366
I was gone 30 minutes. Yeah,
I was gonna mention,

02:12.400 --> 02:13.367
you know,
you really should think about

02:13.401 --> 02:14.835
doing some more cardio
at your age.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.804
Cake says I'm 20.
The cake is a lie, John.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.839
Oh, well,
it's very sweet.

02:18.872 --> 02:21.008
And I'm sure not at all
an effort to cheer me up

02:21.041 --> 02:23.177
because today is
Rosalind's trial.

02:23.211 --> 02:25.646
Well, you know, you <i>can</i> ask
to be assigned somewhere else.

02:25.679 --> 02:28.782
I know, but somehow
that just doesn't feel right.

02:28.816 --> 02:29.983
Shall we have
some of this cake?

02:30.017 --> 02:32.720
After I cheer you up
in the shower.

02:32.753 --> 02:35.623

Morning.
Uh, hi.

03:01.215 --> 03:05.052
Um, are you on your way
to school?
In a few.

03:05.085 --> 03:06.754
You should take
the long way around.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.389
You know, they already
started blocking off

03:08.422 --> 03:10.057
some of those streets
around the courthouse.

03:10.090 --> 03:12.159
I know.
You told me.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.728
I could blow off class
if you want.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.664
We could go shopping
or see a movie.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.332
I'm gonna be fine.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.100
I'm not gonna be
anywhere near Rosalind.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.069
Tim and I
are station-bound,

03:22.102 --> 03:23.871
waiting for
the phone to ring.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.273
On your undercover thing?

03:25.306 --> 03:27.375
Yeah. The original
go-time fell through,

03:27.408 --> 03:29.510
and it's just been
radio silence since then.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.512
Is this the same undercover
thing you and Tim

03:31.545 --> 03:33.581
were <i>discussing</i>
the other night?

03:36.317 --> 03:39.920
I already told you
that kiss didn't mean anything.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.555
Right, right.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.056
It was for the case.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.559
Make out. Stop crime.
That totally tracks.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.361
Go to school.

03:47.395 --> 03:48.462
Okay.

03:48.496 --> 03:50.864
Well,
have a great day.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.466
With your boss.

03:52.500 --> 03:53.634
Who you kissed.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.403
Get out!

03:55.436 --> 03:57.471
And close the door!

04:02.109 --> 04:03.711
You kissed Lucy?

04:03.744 --> 04:05.479
No, no.

04:05.513 --> 04:08.115
No, Dim kissed Juicy, okay?

04:08.148 --> 04:10.584
Or Jake kissed Sava. Whatever.

04:10.618 --> 04:11.752
The-- The point is,

04:11.785 --> 04:13.321
we had to be comfortable
going undercover,

04:13.354 --> 04:14.955
so we practiced
being a couple.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.824
How much
did you practice?

04:18.459 --> 04:20.761
It was just a kiss.
Not that big of a deal.

04:20.794 --> 04:23.431
Then why are we
talking about it?

04:23.464 --> 04:27.167
Because what if it wasn't
just a kiss for her?

04:27.200 --> 04:29.903
You think Lucy
has feelings for you?

04:29.937 --> 04:31.339
No.

04:31.372 --> 04:33.341
Then she probably sees it
how you do.

04:33.374 --> 04:36.176
Just a weird thing
you had to do for work.

04:36.209 --> 04:38.312
Right.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.748
Timothy.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.215
Do <i>yo</i> have feelings
for Lucy?

04:43.651 --> 04:45.786
No.
No, I'm dating Ashley.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.120
And Lucy is with Chris.

04:47.154 --> 04:50.023
And I'm her superior officer, so...

04:50.057 --> 04:52.092
All true.
Not what I asked.

04:57.197 --> 04:59.232
What's the Chief
doing here?

05:01.569 --> 05:02.970
Sgt. Grey: All right,
settle down and listen up.

05:03.003 --> 05:05.005
We got a big day
ahead of us.

05:05.038 --> 05:08.476
The Rosalind Dyer trial is going
to complicate all of our lives.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.611
But before that,

05:10.644 --> 05:12.513
Chief Coleman has
some good news.

05:12.546 --> 05:15.148
Chief.
Thank you, Sergeant.
I'm sure you're all aware

05:15.182 --> 05:17.485
of Officer Nolan's heroic stand
down at the border

05:17.518 --> 05:20.053
which landed a dozen
dangerous felons in custody.

05:20.087 --> 05:22.690
In light of your courageous
and exemplary service,

05:22.723 --> 05:25.993
I've decided to offer you
any assignment in the LAPD.

05:26.026 --> 05:29.363
Any unit, any division,
any position you want

05:29.397 --> 05:32.299
the department to train you for
is yours.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.468
It's what we unofficially call
the Golden Ticket.

05:34.502 --> 05:35.503
Thank you, Ma'am.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.540
It's a big decision.
Don't rush it.

05:39.573 --> 05:42.009
I won't.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.377
Sergeant.
Chief.

05:43.411 --> 05:45.946
What'd I miss?
Nolan got
a Golden Ticket.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.216
Wow.

05:49.249 --> 05:51.385
Congratulations,
Officer Nolan.
Thank you, sir.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.587
I once said
you'll never make detective.

05:53.621 --> 05:56.256
I happily stand corrected.

05:56.289 --> 05:59.026
Don't waste your ticket
by becoming a detective, Nolan.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.828
You know how hard
they have to work?

06:00.861 --> 06:02.262
Go with recruiting.

06:02.295 --> 06:04.064
You get paid
to fly around the country

06:04.097 --> 06:05.499
and talk up the LAPD.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.568
Boring.
You go with air support.

06:07.601 --> 06:08.936
The city will pay
for flight school,

06:08.969 --> 06:10.504
and you'll always have
a backup career.

06:10.538 --> 06:12.740
Do I <i>need</i>
a backup career?

06:12.773 --> 06:14.442
K-9 is the way to go.

06:14.475 --> 06:17.745
Overtime is $200 an hour,
and you get to keep the dog.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.713
Sgt. Grey:
And if all you want is money,

06:19.747 --> 06:21.582
the department will pay you
to learn computer forensics.

06:21.615 --> 06:24.184
Or I could use the ticket
to get back on track

06:24.217 --> 06:25.953
for becoming a training officer
this year.

06:28.121 --> 06:30.290
That's funny.
Yeah.

06:30.323 --> 06:32.893
Kidding.
No, I mean, uh-- no.

06:32.926 --> 06:35.295
I, uh, certainly have
some thinking to do, yeah.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.598
He's gonna pick
something lame.
Oh, for sure.

06:37.631 --> 06:39.633

06:48.408 --> 06:51.144
Yo, I thought you were
never gonna call.

06:51.178 --> 06:54.214
<i>Had to iron out a few details,
but the job's back on track.</i>

06:54.247 --> 06:56.216
<i>Is your lady squared away?</i>
Hell, no.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.317
You think we don't got
lives of our own,

06:57.350 --> 06:59.086
waiting around
on some mystery gig?

06:59.119 --> 07:01.489
<i>Relax. The payday's
worth the suspense.</i>

07:01.522 --> 07:03.657
<i>Wisco and Lyon
are taking point.</i>

07:03.691 --> 07:06.359
<i>And we're adding your buddy
Dayvion Mosby for extra muscle.</i>

07:07.995 --> 07:10.998
Yo, Dayvion's money.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.233
Dayvion's handsy.
Get someone else.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.402
<i>He's already hired.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.404
So what time
we meeting up?
<i>Two hours.</i>

07:17.437 --> 07:18.839
<i>I'll get back to you
with the details.</i>

07:20.508 --> 07:22.242
<i>This Dayvion guy shows up,
it's over.</i>

07:22.275 --> 07:25.145
Then I need to make sure
he doesn't.

07:43.731 --> 07:46.166
Hey.
Hey.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.101
Kind of, uh,--
kind of a circus.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.270
Seriously. Which makes it
that much harder for me

07:50.303 --> 07:51.471
to wrap my head
around the fact

07:51.505 --> 07:53.440
that you and Rosalind
have a relationship.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.776
It's not like we were dating.
Uh, changing the subject--

07:55.809 --> 07:57.645
Chief of Police
gave me a Golden Ticket.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.513
As in Willy Wonka?

07:59.547 --> 08:03.116
As in I can pick any job
I want in the department.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.052
Wow.
What are you gonna pick?

08:05.085 --> 08:07.521
Uh, am I crazy
for wanting to use it

08:07.555 --> 08:09.389
to get back on track
to being a training officer?

08:09.422 --> 08:10.891
Well, you know,
they give you a dog

08:10.924 --> 08:12.693
if you join
the K-9 Unit?

08:12.726 --> 08:15.563
Okay, if you want a dog,
we can just get a dog.

08:15.596 --> 08:16.964
Del Monte:
All right, everybody, listen up.
Can you gather around?

08:16.997 --> 08:19.833
Have your attention
for a second, please.

08:19.867 --> 08:22.536
Thank you very much.
I'm Sean Del Monte.

08:22.570 --> 08:25.338
I'm prosecuting the case
against Rosalind Dyer.

08:25.372 --> 08:26.874
This is Chris Sanford
from my office,

08:26.907 --> 08:28.876
Sergeant Grey, LAPD.

08:28.909 --> 08:31.579
This is Captain Duane Tovar
from the Sheriff's Department.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.714
He's overseeing all security
at the courthouse.

08:33.747 --> 08:36.049
It is my hope
that this trial will close

08:36.083 --> 08:38.752
a very painful chapter
in this city's history

08:38.786 --> 08:42.756
and bring some peace to the
families that she's destroyed.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.758
With that, I'd like to turn it
over to Captain Tovar.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.493
Duane?
Thank you.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.662
This is a rendering
of the Superior Courthouse.

08:48.696 --> 08:52.700
We have 840 daily employees,
7,000 daily visitors.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.735
There are 50 courtrooms.

08:54.768 --> 08:57.370
The Dyer trial will be on the
sixth floor of the West Wing.

08:57.404 --> 09:00.507
The escort team will arrive at a
secret entrance to avoid crowds.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.275
Sergeant Grey's team
will be there

09:02.309 --> 09:04.377
to secure the sixth floor
and escort the prisoner

09:04.411 --> 09:06.346
to and from the courtroom.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.617
<i>The package is in route.
E.T.A. 30 minutes.</i>

09:09.650 --> 09:13.253
We will have eyes on Rosalind
every second of the day.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.659
Do you think I'm a monster,
Deputy Suriel?

09:20.828 --> 09:23.096
I think it's not my job
to decide.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.134
Do <i>yo</i> think
you're a monster?

09:27.167 --> 09:28.969
No.

09:29.002 --> 09:31.571
I think I'm a genius.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.907
I just had the misfortune
of excelling at mutilation

09:33.941 --> 09:36.109
instead of music.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.545
Okay.

09:39.847 --> 09:41.649
That's him.
Hey, Dayvion.

09:41.682 --> 09:44.251
What's up, Officers?

09:44.284 --> 09:46.053
Just here for
a quick parole search.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.088
Come on in.
I ain't got nothing to hide.

09:49.156 --> 09:50.991
Actually,
let's start with your car.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.626
That's not my car.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.494
Oh, no?

09:54.527 --> 09:55.829
Well, let's just check
to be sure.

09:57.530 --> 09:58.932
That's not
a good start, man.

10:05.639 --> 10:06.907
Oh.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.776
And it just got worse.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.610
I suppose this isn't
your gun, either?

10:11.879 --> 10:13.146
All right.

10:16.116 --> 10:20.320
Ugh. Why couldn't my
doppelganger be less greasy?

10:20.353 --> 10:22.990
It's actually surprising
how easily you turn skeevy.

10:24.725 --> 10:27.527
Oh.
Looking good, Juicy.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.930
I am seriously second-guessing
this tactical decision

10:29.963 --> 10:31.665
to wear a thong
for authenticity.

10:31.699 --> 10:33.600
It's like...
* <i>When I walked in the Jam ♪</i>

10:33.633 --> 10:34.768
<i>♪ Your girl was clockin',
sweatin' ♪</i>

10:34.802 --> 10:36.704
Yo. Are we doin' this
or what?

10:36.737 --> 10:38.271
<i>We are.
Meet my guys</i>

10:38.305 --> 10:40.340
<i>at Whittier Air Strip.
30 minutes.</i>

10:40.373 --> 10:43.310
Air strip?
I thought this job was local.

10:43.343 --> 10:46.179
<i>It's not.
That a problem?</i>

10:46.213 --> 10:48.315
Uh, yeah,
that's a problem.

10:48.348 --> 10:51.284
I travel with
three suitcases minimum.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.553
It requires precision
to look this good.

10:53.586 --> 10:56.489
<i>Tough. I'm paying you to drive,
not to play dress up.</i>

10:56.523 --> 10:58.225
<i>So get your ass
to the Air Strip</i>

10:58.258 --> 11:01.028
<i>or look good in a coffin.</i>

11:01.061 --> 11:03.296
We got to call it off.
What's the problem?

11:03.330 --> 11:06.066
Once we're in the air,
no backup, no surveillance.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.701
Things go sideways,
we're completely on our own.

11:07.735 --> 11:09.336
Plus, we'll have no idea
where they're going.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.004
It's not worth the risk.
I'm pulling the plug.

11:11.038 --> 11:14.307
Uh, wait. Hold on. The pilot
has to file a flight plan.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.476
You could follow along
in the LAPD plane.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.411
The paperwork to get that
authorized will take all day.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.180
And you're wheels up
in an hour.

11:21.749 --> 11:24.317
I mean, I can get a private jet
there in 45 minutes.

11:24.351 --> 11:27.487
Also, what kind of caviar
do you guys like?

11:27.520 --> 11:30.023
I'll just get
an assortment.

11:58.318 --> 11:59.753
Hello, John.

11:59.787 --> 12:01.855
Rosalind.

12:01.889 --> 12:05.125
You look good. Happy.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.560
Would you say
that's job satisfaction?

12:07.594 --> 12:09.162
Or Bailey?

12:10.430 --> 12:12.232
I'd say
it's seeing justice served.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.238
He's such a boy scout.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.573
John Nolan.
Megan Suriel.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.142
I assume you've been briefed
on our security arrangements.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.610
I have.
Let's go.

12:25.678 --> 12:28.415
You know,
I follow Bailey on Instagram.

12:28.448 --> 12:31.218
Oh, I love that cake
she made this morning.

12:31.251 --> 12:34.487
And Luna, too.
She is getting good on a horse.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.089
Oh, and Lucy's
little friend Tamara--

12:36.123 --> 12:38.458
she is doing so well
at SMC.

12:38.491 --> 12:41.761
Am I supposed to applaud
that you can use social media?

12:41.795 --> 12:43.230
Or are you hoping
I'll be unsettled

12:43.263 --> 12:45.165
that you're name-dropping people
I care about?

12:45.198 --> 12:46.733
I think it's the only
party trick she's got.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.602
I was so disappointed
Lucy decided not to testify.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.972
I was really looking forward
to seeing her again--

12:52.005 --> 12:54.174
revisiting
our favorite song.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.575
Will you please send her
my love?

12:55.608 --> 12:57.210
No.

13:13.660 --> 13:15.428
Yo. Nice ride.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.830
You're late.

13:16.864 --> 13:20.200
Yeah, well, our quickie
wasn't so quick.

13:21.168 --> 13:24.104
Where's Dayvion?
Flaked.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.973
That ain't like him.
That's exactly like him.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.307
Hajek's pissed.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.275
We had to scramble
to get a replacement.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.342
That's Sway.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.879
Hi, sexy.
I'm Sava.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.380
What's up?
Jake.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.448
We got a lot of gear.
It's a big job.

13:35.482 --> 13:39.052
Mm-hmm. Are you gonna
finally tell us what it is?

13:39.086 --> 13:41.521
When we're airborne. First...

13:41.554 --> 13:42.789
Cellphones.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.224
Mm.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.893
You'll get them back
when it's over.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.627
Can't risk
operational security.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.629
You hear that, baby?

13:49.662 --> 13:51.398
We're in
the big leagues now--

13:51.431 --> 13:53.700
using terms like
"operational security."

13:54.868 --> 13:57.570
Get in the damn plane.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.709
You heard the man.
Get in the damn plane.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.683
They're boarding.
How's that jet coming?

14:10.717 --> 14:12.920
It's almost here.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.188
Hajek's crew just filed
their flight plan.

14:15.222 --> 14:16.924
Where are they going?
Vegas.

14:26.266 --> 14:29.102
Hey, Beth.
Wondered if I'd run into you.

14:29.136 --> 14:32.405
Wesley. Did I hear you're
joining the D.A.'s office?
Next week.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.874
I'm here defending my last case
before the transition.

14:34.908 --> 14:37.044
I was shocked to hear

14:37.077 --> 14:38.411
you're representing
Rosalind Dyer.

14:38.445 --> 14:39.879
Thought corporate law
was your thing.

14:39.913 --> 14:42.082
Corporate law
is my dad's thing.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.616
I need to pave
my own way.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.685
Well, representing
the most brutal serial killer

14:45.718 --> 14:48.288
in L.A.'s history-- that'll
certainly put you on the map.

14:50.623 --> 14:51.858
This is me.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.626
I would wish you luck,
but, uh...

14:53.660 --> 14:55.062
I hope your client
rots in hell.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.364
Well, you're not alone.
Crap, I'm late.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.232
Uh, take the stairs.
The elevators are a nightmare.

14:59.266 --> 15:00.600
Thanks.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.940
The package
is on the sixth floor.

15:06.974 --> 15:08.475
We're shutting it down now.

15:14.181 --> 15:16.283
Whoa. This area is secure.
You need to go back downstairs.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.952
I'm Beth Veston,
attorney for Rosalind Dyer.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.220
You can see your client
in the courtroom.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.289
My client has
a lawful right

15:22.322 --> 15:24.391
to appear in civilian clothing
at trial.

15:24.424 --> 15:28.061
She gets changed, or you get
sued and I get a mistrial.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.862
So spunky.
Don't you just love her.

15:31.664 --> 15:32.966
That room right there
is for counseling clients.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.968
She can change there.
I will be present.

15:35.002 --> 15:37.170
What about attorney/client
privacy?

15:37.204 --> 15:39.572
I'll close my ears.
Peel off and secure each door.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.174
No one else
comes in this hall.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.809
See you soon, John.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.013
Get in there.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.957
Can't I sit?

15:57.991 --> 15:59.826
You're gonna be
sitting all day.

16:01.661 --> 16:02.929
Step back.

16:02.962 --> 16:03.963
It's already
been searched.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.598
She's just
doing her job.

16:08.168 --> 16:11.838
All right.
Get her dressed.

16:11.871 --> 16:13.506
Well, aren't you
going to uncuff me?

16:13.540 --> 16:14.807
Not all the way.

16:14.841 --> 16:16.343
Your attorney can help you
get dressed.

16:16.376 --> 16:19.179
I'll uncuff you in stages,
starting at the bottom.

16:37.197 --> 16:40.467
Did I do it?

16:40.500 --> 16:41.634
Is she dead?

16:41.668 --> 16:43.536
You did great.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.072
Get her keys.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.746
This is taking too long.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.515
Sgt. Grey: <i>Nolan, there's been
a credible bomb threat.</i>

16:55.548 --> 16:57.150
<i>We're evacuating
the courthouse.</i>

16:57.184 --> 16:58.685
<i>So I need you
to secure Rosalind</i>

16:58.718 --> 17:00.720
<i>and put her back
on the prison transport.</i>

17:02.555 --> 17:04.524
It's Rosalind.
She's trying to escape.

17:12.799 --> 17:15.268
Rosalind is out of pocket.
She may be dressed as a deputy.

17:15.302 --> 17:16.936
Repeat,
Rosalind has escaped.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.871
We need to lock
this building down.

Rosalind Dyer is 45-32.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.556
Stay calm. Keep moving.

17:36.589 --> 17:39.526
Nolan.
What's going on?

17:39.559 --> 17:41.694

Your friends

18:40.353 --> 18:43.756
Ain't no one here to have fun.
It's a job.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.258
That's what everyone
keeps saying.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.126
Except so far,
it's just been

18:47.160 --> 18:49.128
the world's lamest
bachelor party.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.698
Yo, y'all gonna tell us
what this gig is or what?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.502
You know
who Roman Krupka is?

18:55.535 --> 18:57.103
Nope.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.105
He imports H
for the Monarch Cartel.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.508
So, the competition.
Something like that.

19:01.541 --> 19:04.344
Krupka's paranoid,
doesn't trust computers,

19:04.377 --> 19:06.513
never keeps
a written record.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.715
The details of his operation
exist in one place--

19:08.748 --> 19:10.183
"The Brain."

19:10.217 --> 19:12.151
A man
named Leonard Madris.

19:12.185 --> 19:14.287
Ain't that
a little dangerous--

19:14.321 --> 19:16.389
making one man the center
of your whole operation.

19:16.423 --> 19:18.391
Yeah, it is.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.126
That's why Madris is kept
under heavy guard.

19:20.159 --> 19:23.162
Barely leaves
Krupka's compound.

19:23.196 --> 19:24.364
But we received
a solid tip

19:24.397 --> 19:26.533
that he's headed to Vegas
this weekend.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.201
With his bodyguards?

19:28.235 --> 19:29.369
Never goes
anywhere without them.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.870
That's where
you come in.

19:30.903 --> 19:34.207
You guys take out the guards
while I grab Madris.

19:34.241 --> 19:38.044
And then we torture The Brain
for every detail.

19:38.077 --> 19:40.247
And take over
the business.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.249
Oh.

19:42.282 --> 19:45.585
It sounds like we should be
getting paid more.
Mm-hmm.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.654
Tough.
Like my mom used to say--

19:47.687 --> 19:50.723
"You get what you get,
and you don't get upset."

19:53.025 --> 19:56.429
Well, this seems a lot bigger
than we thought.

19:56.463 --> 19:58.064
Yep.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.372
Sgt. Grey:
So, what are you doing here?

20:05.405 --> 20:06.673
I thought you were on
maternity leave.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.909
I was until "Jacqueline
the Ripper" escaped.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.744
What can I do?

20:11.778 --> 20:14.046
Are you sure? You're like
eleventy months pregnant.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.548
Okay,
let me amend that.

20:15.582 --> 20:18.251
What can I do that does not
involve leaving the station?

20:18.285 --> 20:20.287
Rosalind's lawyer's
in the box.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.688
Says she'll only talk
to Nolan.

20:21.721 --> 20:22.755
Why don't you do
the interview with him?

20:22.789 --> 20:24.291
It's a full house.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.892
Rosalind mentioned them
by name.

20:25.925 --> 20:28.027
We got protection units
for everyone else.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.462
Oh, I know.
I said hi to the one

20:29.496 --> 20:31.264
outside my house
as I was leaving.

20:31.298 --> 20:33.032
And by the way,
love the shoes.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.902
Hey.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.637
What's this I hear
about a Golden Ticket?

20:37.670 --> 20:39.772
Well, that hardly seems
important right now.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.642
All I am saying is
welcome to the club.
Thank you.

20:42.675 --> 20:45.712
You look like you're ready
to give birth at any moment.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.147
Do you want to sit?
I will never be able
to get back up.

20:48.180 --> 20:50.082
You know, I could ask Bailey
to call the firehouse,

20:50.116 --> 20:51.217
have them bring in
a gurney,

20:51.250 --> 20:52.585
just so at least
you could lie down?

20:52.619 --> 20:54.787
You had me at--
"do the job from bed."

20:54.821 --> 20:57.056
I'll do it.
I saw Bailey in the break room.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.392
Come on, Tamara.
Let's get some snacks.

20:59.426 --> 21:02.662
We are going to be here
for a while.

21:02.695 --> 21:04.331
Wesley knows
the lawyer.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.632
Really?
A little.

21:05.665 --> 21:07.334
We went to high school together.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.735
Our families move
in the same circles.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.970
Meaning-- she's rich?
Beyond.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.572
Any insight into why
she would do this?

21:12.605 --> 21:13.973
Not really, no.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.175
I mean, she was always
a little creepy.

21:16.208 --> 21:19.278
Very bright,
but casually cruel.

21:19.312 --> 21:20.647
I always chalked it up
to privilege.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.449
Clearly,
Rosalind hired her

21:22.482 --> 21:24.451
because she sensed Beth
would make a good acolyte.

21:24.484 --> 21:26.252
Like Caleb.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.286
Has she asked
for a lawyer?

21:27.320 --> 21:29.456
No.
She's representing herself.

21:29.489 --> 21:31.324
Let's go talk to her, then.

21:36.563 --> 21:39.532
Who are you?
Detective Harper.

21:39.566 --> 21:41.768
And I am supposed to be
at home in bed right now,

21:41.801 --> 21:44.704
so forgive me
if I skip the small talk.

21:44.737 --> 21:47.707
You confessed
to killing Deputy Suriel.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.442
Why'd you do that?

21:49.476 --> 21:52.111
Rosalind talked about you
all the time.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.347
The boy scout.

21:54.381 --> 21:57.450
Honestly, it made me
a little jealous.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.519
Look,
you clearly need help.

21:59.552 --> 22:01.320
Tell us
where Rosalind is.

22:01.354 --> 22:02.489
We'll push for you
to get sentenced

22:02.522 --> 22:04.691
to a psychiatric hospital.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.893
I'm not crazy.

22:06.926 --> 22:09.195
I'm special.

22:09.228 --> 22:11.564
Rosalind showed me that.

22:13.866 --> 22:14.901
What are you doing?

22:19.372 --> 22:21.941
I'm supposed to
tell you something.

22:25.111 --> 22:28.180
People are gonna die.

22:28.214 --> 22:31.317
People are gonna die,
and you can't save them.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.495
Can I help you?

22:42.529 --> 22:44.096
Yes.

22:46.766 --> 22:48.267
Your daughter sent me.

23:00.079 --> 23:02.114
Help me!

23:17.997 --> 23:20.199
Look at this.
No way.

23:20.232 --> 23:23.235
What?
Rosalind Dyer
just escaped.

23:23.269 --> 23:25.538
I'm glad we're not
in L.A. tonight.

23:25.572 --> 23:28.074
That chick gives me nightmares.

23:28.107 --> 23:29.776
Yeah, but it'd be
the perfect night to run wild,

23:29.809 --> 23:32.479
'cause the cops will totally be
distracted looking for her.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.716
How long till we land?

23:36.749 --> 23:38.284
15 minutes.

23:38.317 --> 23:40.587
Plenty of time.
For what?

23:40.620 --> 23:42.388
Mile high club, baby.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.992
I never thought
you'd ask.

23:49.361 --> 23:52.098
How could this happen?
I don't know.

23:52.131 --> 23:53.800
But every law enforcement agency
in Southern California

23:53.833 --> 23:54.901
is on it, okay?

23:54.934 --> 23:56.168
She won't be out long.

23:56.202 --> 23:57.269
D-Did--
Uh, did she have help?

23:57.303 --> 23:59.005
Another apprentice.
Like Caleb?

23:59.038 --> 24:01.307
I mean--
Stop, okay?

24:01.340 --> 24:02.909
Stop.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.110
We can't worry
about that right now.

24:04.143 --> 24:06.579
If your head is not 100%
in the game,

24:06.613 --> 24:08.748
it'll get you killed.

24:08.781 --> 24:11.450
You're right. I-I know.
I just-- It's-- I'm fine.

24:11.484 --> 24:13.786
I-I can do this. No.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.187
No, you're not.

24:15.221 --> 24:16.355
I'm pulling the plug
as soon as we land.

24:16.388 --> 24:18.525
Uh...

24:18.558 --> 24:20.159
No.

24:20.192 --> 24:22.795
Look, the stakes
are too high.

24:22.829 --> 24:25.498
This is our one chance
at Madris.

24:25.532 --> 24:27.834
The news threw me for a second,
but I'm...

24:27.867 --> 24:29.035
I'm fine.

24:31.203 --> 24:32.972
I can do this.

24:33.005 --> 24:35.808
Yo, finish up.
We're landing.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.382
Okay.

24:43.415 --> 24:46.853
Lucy, if you change your mind,
you just say the word.

24:46.886 --> 24:48.287
I will.
Okay?

24:48.320 --> 24:49.556
Mm-hmm.
Let's go.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.023
Wait.
What?

24:51.057 --> 24:52.992
We're supposed to be
hooking up in here.

24:53.025 --> 24:55.795
What?

25:03.870 --> 25:07.506
Okay.
Um... that's good.

25:07.540 --> 25:08.908
Yeah.
Let's do this.

either side of you.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.110
Sway's across the hall.

26:18.144 --> 26:20.312
We have some time,
so rest up.

26:20.346 --> 26:23.049
Who sleeps in Vegas?
We're hitting the clubs.

26:23.082 --> 26:26.118
No. You're staying close,
and you're staying sharp.

26:26.152 --> 26:28.320
Jake!
We're on the move
at first light.

26:28.354 --> 26:30.189
Jake!

26:32.424 --> 26:33.592
Hey, girl.

26:33.626 --> 26:34.994
Oh,
don't "hey, girl" me.

26:35.027 --> 26:36.162
You weren't even
gonna look at me?

26:37.363 --> 26:38.597
Didn't I tell you
the next time I saw you

26:38.631 --> 26:40.833
I'd light that greasy hair
of yours on fire?

26:44.036 --> 26:45.004
You lost a lot of weight, huh?

26:45.037 --> 26:48.174
Oh, hey. Hello?
Back off.

26:48.207 --> 26:50.877
You must be the new skank.

26:51.844 --> 26:53.279
Who are you calling
a skank?
Aah!

26:53.312 --> 26:54.814
You better get
the hell out of here.

26:54.847 --> 26:56.415
If I see you again,
I'm gonna rip

26:56.448 --> 26:57.950
this janky-ass hairpiece
out of your head.

26:57.984 --> 26:59.118
Hmm?

26:59.151 --> 27:01.087
That's enough.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.923
What? You want me
to let her go?

27:03.956 --> 27:06.125
Please.

27:09.328 --> 27:11.964
Psycho.

27:13.532 --> 27:15.267
She's cute.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.203
You two need to keep
a low profile.

27:17.236 --> 27:18.604
The last thing we want
is for you to get arrested

27:18.637 --> 27:20.339
over some B.S.
with an ex.

27:20.372 --> 27:22.208
Yo, we'll be on
our best behavior.

27:22.241 --> 27:23.676
Scout's honor.
Mm, screw that.

27:23.710 --> 27:26.212
We are going to hit
the casino

27:26.245 --> 27:28.480
and see if we can get lucky
three times in one day.

Target's Leonard Madris.

27:52.371 --> 27:55.307
Madris knows where everything
in Roman Krupka's operation

27:55.341 --> 27:57.409
is buried--
and everyone.

27:57.443 --> 27:59.411
Where is he? I'll have
Vegas P.D. pick him up.

27:59.445 --> 28:01.147
They haven't told us.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.681
We make our move first thing
in the morning.

28:02.715 --> 28:04.083
We won't know anything
until we're en route.

28:04.116 --> 28:05.184
What happened
with Rosalind?

28:05.217 --> 28:06.753
She hired
a psychopath lawyer

28:06.786 --> 28:08.220
who helped her kill a deputy
and escape.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.524
I knew it.

28:12.558 --> 28:14.026
Another Caleb.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.030
You need to protect Tamara.
Already on it.

28:18.064 --> 28:19.832
She's at the station,

28:19.866 --> 28:21.934
and we have protection details
on everyone we think

28:21.968 --> 28:23.903
Rosalind might even think
about going after.

28:27.373 --> 28:30.109
Are you sure
you're up for this?

28:30.142 --> 28:32.544
If you need to pull
the rip cord, I understand.

28:32.578 --> 28:35.381
She's solid.

28:35.414 --> 28:38.117
Okay.
I'll contact Vegas P.D.,

28:38.150 --> 28:40.920
and with any luck, they'll get
a location on Madris tonight

28:40.953 --> 28:43.289
so we can snatch up your crew
before bullets start flying.

28:43.322 --> 28:45.091
What happens if we don't
catch him in time?

28:45.124 --> 28:46.525
We have to be creative.

28:46.558 --> 28:48.294
Remember,
our priority is saving lives,

28:48.327 --> 28:49.929
even if that means
we lose Madris.

28:52.498 --> 28:54.600
Let's go.

28:54.633 --> 28:55.968
That's it for me.

28:58.838 --> 29:00.339
You won all that
just now?

29:01.440 --> 29:02.274
Yeah.

29:03.976 --> 29:06.112
Can you help me?
If you let me keep some.

29:06.145 --> 29:07.113
Eh...

29:10.182 --> 29:11.550
I got something.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.319
I found an article
Beth published

29:13.352 --> 29:15.387
in her school's
law review.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.824
And she argues that criminality
is a construct that changes

29:17.857 --> 29:20.626
based on the prevailing
social mores of the culture.

29:20.659 --> 29:21.961
Sounds pretentious.

29:21.994 --> 29:24.263
I don't entirely disagree.

29:24.296 --> 29:26.665
Mm. Towards the end,
she defends cannibalism.

29:26.698 --> 29:29.401
Ooh. Okay.
Well, she lost me there.

29:29.435 --> 29:32.604
Morally flexible.
Just Rosalind's type.

29:32.638 --> 29:35.607
I get what Rosalind saw in Beth
and what she needed from her,

29:35.641 --> 29:37.576
but what does Beth
get out of this?

29:37.609 --> 29:39.578
Love?

29:39.611 --> 29:41.747
She's infatuated
with Rosalind?

29:41.780 --> 29:44.350
Maybe.
I think you're gonna want
to see this.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.452
They've been scrubbing security
footage from the courthouse.

29:46.485 --> 29:48.787
This BMW was parked
by the south exit.

29:48.821 --> 29:50.356
It's registered
to Nicole Veston.

29:50.389 --> 29:51.958
Beth's mom?

29:51.991 --> 29:54.593
Okay, so she borrowed
the car for the day?

29:54.626 --> 29:56.328
No. Beth's car is still parked
at the courthouse.

29:56.362 --> 29:59.131
So she left it there
for Rosalind.

29:59.165 --> 30:00.599
Probably had
a change of clothes

30:00.632 --> 30:02.268
and a burner phone
ready to go.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.103
We don't think
the mom is in on it, do we?

30:04.136 --> 30:07.039
No, no.
Beth hates her parents.

30:07.073 --> 30:08.640
It's more likely
she used their car to hurt them.

30:08.674 --> 30:11.177
Anybody I ever knew
who hated their parents

30:11.210 --> 30:13.846
were also scared
of them.

30:13.880 --> 30:16.282
<i>That</i> is what she's getting
out of this relationship.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.417
Rosalind's gonna kill her
parents for her.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.355
Go, go, go!

30:23.389 --> 30:24.823
Secure the perimeter.

30:45.611 --> 30:47.179
Bodies!

30:52.919 --> 30:54.020
She cleaned out the safe.

30:56.188 --> 30:57.589
Sir.

31:00.026 --> 31:03.162
<i>Hello, John.</i>

31:03.195 --> 31:07.399
<i>Oh, it really was nice
to see you happy this morning.</i>

31:07.433 --> 31:10.769
<i>And I thought maybe you'd like
to see me happy, too.</i>

31:14.873 --> 31:17.109
<i>Ah.</i>

31:17.143 --> 31:19.245
<i>Really is
like riding a bike.</i>

31:24.416 --> 31:26.718
<i>Authorities urge caution
and calm tonight</i>

31:26.752 --> 31:30.689
<i>as the city reels from the news
that Rosalind Dyer has escaped.</i>

31:32.458 --> 31:34.260
They don't know anything
we don't.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.766
Yeah.

31:40.799 --> 31:43.970
Ugh,
my head is killing me.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.141
You're really good at this,
you know?

31:51.243 --> 31:52.644
The whole
undercover thing.

31:56.148 --> 31:57.849
Thank you.

32:01.853 --> 32:03.789
Uh, do you mind if I take
the first shower?

32:03.822 --> 32:05.824
No, it's fine.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.166
Hey, you hungry?

32:14.200 --> 32:17.269
Yes. I would get some
French fries if you're ordering.

32:20.272 --> 32:21.573
Yeah. O-Okay.

32:21.607 --> 32:24.410
Um... fries.

32:36.122 --> 32:39.491
<i>All even here
in the late-going 89th minute.</i>

32:39.525 --> 32:41.760
<i>2-2.</i>

32:43.295 --> 32:46.198
The water pressure
is epic.

32:46.232 --> 32:48.534
And I'm totally taking
one of these robes.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.269
Wait.
That's not stealing, right?

32:50.302 --> 32:52.138
No, no. They'll just
charge it to Hajek.

32:52.171 --> 32:53.939
Then we should take two.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.378
What?

32:59.411 --> 33:00.779
Do you want
to talk about it?

33:00.812 --> 33:02.381
About what?

33:02.414 --> 33:05.951
The airplane bathroom.
Your apartment.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.619
Look, I-I don't know.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.756
Call me crazy, but it just
doesn't feel like pretend.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.661
Uh...

33:15.694 --> 33:18.230
It's an intimate act.

33:18.264 --> 33:22.234
I mean,
we'd have to be dead inside

33:22.268 --> 33:24.336
for it to not trigger
something, right?

33:24.370 --> 33:26.905
It-- It's basic biology.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.876
Okay, so...

33:30.909 --> 33:32.678
So you're saying
it's not a big deal?

33:32.711 --> 33:34.213
Doesn't mean anything?

33:34.246 --> 33:36.014
Right? I...

33:43.722 --> 33:45.691
Yo.
<i>It's me.
Can you talk?</i>

33:45.724 --> 33:47.593
Yeah. I'm just alone with Lucy
in the hotel room.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.561
<i>Uh-oh.</i>
What do you got?

33:49.595 --> 33:52.030
<i>Las Vegas P.D. got a location
on Madris.</i>

33:52.064 --> 33:55.834
<i>We're mobilizing with LVPD--
unless you think you need us.</i>

33:55.867 --> 33:58.070
No. We should be good
until morning.
<i>When we get Madris,</i>

33:58.104 --> 33:59.671
<i>we're coming back
to grab Hajek's crew.</i>

33:59.705 --> 34:01.273
All right.
We'll be ready. Good luck.

34:01.307 --> 34:03.375
<i>Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.</i>

34:03.409 --> 34:05.211
They get a line
on Madris?
Yeah.

34:05.244 --> 34:07.379
Good. Okay. Uh,
I'm gonna blow-dry my hair.

34:07.413 --> 34:10.449
Otherwise, it'll be crazy
in the morning.

34:13.785 --> 34:16.488
Hey, Jake.

34:20.426 --> 34:21.993
Hey, Jake.
I know you're in there.

34:35.841 --> 34:39.278
Hey, buddy.
This girl says you're not Jake.

34:39.311 --> 34:41.079
Go get her.

34:56.695 --> 34:57.963
Don't kill her yet.

34:57.996 --> 34:59.131
No, you got this
all wrong.

34:59.165 --> 35:00.666
Chick hasn't seen me
in forever.

35:00.699 --> 35:02.434
I lost weight.
So what?

35:02.468 --> 35:04.069
She said you guys hooked up
three weeks ago,

35:04.102 --> 35:05.637
you had quite the gut.

35:15.181 --> 35:17.183
Are you okay?
I'll live.

35:17.216 --> 35:19.017
Hands behind your back!
Do it now!

35:20.352 --> 35:21.453
Hands behind your back.

35:25.491 --> 35:27.626
Oh, gosh. Remind me
not to take a guy out

35:27.659 --> 35:28.927
while I'm wearing
a robe.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.496
I showed him
the entire world just now.

35:35.534 --> 35:37.536
Rosalind's only been out
for 12 hours

35:37.569 --> 35:40.539
and three people
are dead.

35:40.572 --> 35:43.509
This isn't your fault.

35:45.544 --> 35:47.646
Well, I was the one
that pushed

35:47.679 --> 35:49.615
to try her
for Caleb's crimes.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.883
She was already gonna spend
the rest of her life in prison.

35:51.917 --> 35:54.686
No. Y-You wanted to give
Caleb's victims closure.

35:54.720 --> 35:58.190
Yeah. But I also wanted
the glory of trying that case.

36:00.392 --> 36:02.428
Now I got to live
with that.

36:05.531 --> 36:07.199
Ah. Go home.

36:07.233 --> 36:09.201
Get some sleep.

36:09.235 --> 36:10.836
There's a police escort
waiting for you downstairs.

36:13.239 --> 36:14.540
What are you gonna do?

36:14.573 --> 36:16.208
I'm gonna finish
this bottle.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.012
Good night. Go easy. Yeah.

36:21.046 --> 36:22.113
See you.
See you tomorrow.

36:23.449 --> 36:24.683
Hey, Chris.

36:24.716 --> 36:27.018
Yeah?

36:27.052 --> 36:30.589
When you see Lucy tonight...

36:30.622 --> 36:32.424
tell her I'm sorry.

36:33.725 --> 36:35.694
Yeah. I will.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.402
Hey, it's me.

36:43.435 --> 36:45.604
I-I know you're not
checking your messages.

36:45.637 --> 36:47.406
You probably don't even have
your phone with you.

36:47.439 --> 36:50.776
But, uh, I wanted to call
and say I'm thinking about you,

36:50.809 --> 36:53.412
and, uh, I can't wait
until you're home.

36:53.445 --> 36:56.748
Please, just, uh, call me
the second you hear this.

36:59.751 --> 37:01.720
Hey.

37:26.144 --> 37:28.380
Wake up,
sleeping beauty.

37:28.414 --> 37:30.248
Did we catch her?
No.

37:30.282 --> 37:32.718
But I am here
to take you home regardless.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.586
Mm. Mm-hmm.

37:34.620 --> 37:37.889
Not a great start
to maternity leave.

37:37.923 --> 37:40.992
Well, taking it easy
is not your strong suit.

37:41.026 --> 37:42.894
No,
but I have other gifts.

37:42.928 --> 37:45.130
So many other gifts.

37:45.163 --> 37:46.665
Here's your first lesson
in self-care--

37:46.698 --> 37:49.635
You ready?
Step one-- leave the station.

37:49.668 --> 37:51.437
Mm.

37:51.470 --> 37:54.440
Is step two eat ice cream
for breakfast?

37:54.473 --> 37:56.942
How'd you guess?

37:56.975 --> 37:58.209
Bye, guys.

38:01.647 --> 38:03.949
Agent Garza just called.

38:03.982 --> 38:06.184
A Porsche registered
to the Veston family

38:06.217 --> 38:08.019
crossed the border
three hours ago.

38:08.053 --> 38:09.988
So Rosalind is gone?

38:10.021 --> 38:12.123
It's safe for us all
to go home?
That's right.

38:12.157 --> 38:13.792
Sweet.

38:13.825 --> 38:14.993
Lucy just texted.

38:15.026 --> 38:17.363
She's headed back
to the apartment.

38:17.396 --> 38:19.498
Well, it's been real.

38:19.531 --> 38:22.000
I wouldn't want to hide from a
crazed killer with anyone else.

38:22.033 --> 38:24.135
Let's go find my wife.
We'll give you a ride home.

38:25.571 --> 38:28.139
So how long do you think
Rosalind will lay low?

38:28.173 --> 38:29.675
If she's smart, forever.

38:29.708 --> 38:31.276
She sticks her head up
even for a second,

38:31.309 --> 38:32.511
the feds will find her.

38:32.544 --> 38:35.213
She won't stop killing.
She can't.

38:35.246 --> 38:36.382
As long
as she keeps quiet,

38:36.415 --> 38:38.817
takes people
that won't be missed,

38:38.850 --> 38:40.786
she could fly under the radar
for a very long time.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.621
She's not that modest.

38:42.654 --> 38:45.624
Getting caught was the best
thing that ever happened to her.

38:45.657 --> 38:49.528
She wants us to know
exactly what she's capable of.

38:49.561 --> 38:53.298
On that terrifying note
let's go home.

38:53.331 --> 38:54.566
All right.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.635
Good work today.
Not good enough.

38:56.668 --> 38:59.871
Hey, some days
are like that.

38:59.905 --> 39:02.040
I'm sure this is the furthest
thing from your mind,

39:02.073 --> 39:03.575
but have you decided

39:03.609 --> 39:05.477
what you're gonna do
with your Golden Ticket?

39:05.511 --> 39:08.480
Yes, I have.

39:08.514 --> 39:10.148
Woof woof?
Very funny, but no.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.417
Detective?

39:11.450 --> 39:13.084
Also no.

39:14.252 --> 39:16.187
Training officer.

39:18.924 --> 39:21.993
I knew it,
and I admire it.

39:22.027 --> 39:24.162
Of course, everyone else is
gonna give you endless grief--

39:24.195 --> 39:25.564
Of course.

39:25.597 --> 39:27.699
But I know you're doing it
to give back.

39:27.733 --> 39:29.768
And that's noble
as hell.

39:29.801 --> 39:31.169
If I want to be part
of the change,

39:31.202 --> 39:32.671
I need to put my money
where my mouth is.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.205
Literally.

39:34.239 --> 39:36.041
Do you know how much
forensic techs can make?

39:36.074 --> 39:38.877
Yes. I--

39:38.910 --> 39:41.447
I'll schedule your T.O. exam
as soon as possible.

39:41.480 --> 39:43.582
Well, maybe give me
a couple days to study up.

39:43.615 --> 39:45.784
I've been
a little busy.

39:45.817 --> 39:47.285
Will do. Right.

39:50.055 --> 39:52.257
I cannot wait to get out
of these clothes.

39:52.290 --> 39:55.060
Yeah. I'm not gonna miss
that hairdo.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.363
I kinda like yours.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.400
Thank you
for walking me up.

40:02.434 --> 40:05.804
Yeah. No problem.

40:05.837 --> 40:08.273
I guess this is it.

40:08.306 --> 40:11.376
Tomorrow, we are back
to being us.

40:11.409 --> 40:12.778
Right.

40:12.811 --> 40:14.780
And everything
that happened undercover

40:14.813 --> 40:17.616
we will just
leave behind.

40:17.649 --> 40:19.384
Right.

40:19.417 --> 40:22.387
Yeah. What happens undercover
stays undercover.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.793
You know, in a sense,

40:27.826 --> 40:30.261
since we haven't been debriefed,
we're still undercover.

No.

41:33.191 --> 41:35.894
Wait.
He still has a pulse.

41:35.927 --> 41:38.063
Yeah, this is
Sergeant Tim Bradford.

41:38.096 --> 41:42.133
I need an ambulance at 2733
Elmhurst Drive, Apartment 610.

41:42.167 --> 41:44.135
Tim.

Rosalind?

I have to be quick.
We're refueling.

42:01.787 --> 42:04.823
But I just wanted to make sure
someone checked on Lucy.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.592
What have you done?
