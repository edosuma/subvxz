00:13.346 --> 00:14.347
Cheers.

00:16.182 --> 00:17.475
You work in the prison.

00:18.226 --> 00:20.270
-Your name's Danny.
-What did you say?

00:21.229 --> 00:22.939
Do you like surprises, Danny?

00:27.444 --> 00:29.946
No. Wait!

00:35.702 --> 00:37.245
Hot off the LaserJet.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.916
Uh, let me guess,
this is your sixth article

00:42.000 --> 00:43.543
on Lockwood
since he got out of prison?

00:45.545 --> 00:47.046
-New angle?
-Nope.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.674
But people need to be reminded,
you know, that...

00:49.758 --> 00:51.134
That he's a murderer.

00:51.217 --> 00:52.552
There's that.

00:52.635 --> 00:55.597
It feels like
I'm screaming into the void, but...

00:55.930 --> 00:58.600
You wanna save that void screaming
until after we eat?

00:58.683 --> 00:59.684
James.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.144
-Hey.
-Lunch.

01:01.227 --> 01:03.480
Oh, my God, lunch. I totally forgot.

01:03.563 --> 01:04.981
Bad. Kara is so bad!

01:05.065 --> 01:07.484
Okay, you're embarrassing.
Let's go.

01:07.567 --> 01:08.610
Hey.

01:08.693 --> 01:12.280
Are we still on for
the, um, research trip?

01:14.783 --> 01:16.951
Things have been so busy
with all the Lockwood stuff,

01:17.035 --> 01:19.412
that I totally forgot
we have an appointment

01:19.496 --> 01:21.498
with the City Auditor.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.042
I'm sorry.

01:24.125 --> 01:25.960
It's okay. You're only human.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.256
-Uh, I'll call you later.
-Okay.

01:32.842 --> 01:35.303
Well, I guess
I'll get a move on, too.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.014
Work has been crazy with

01:38.097 --> 01:40.391
Lena moving
into the DEO this week, it's...

01:42.143 --> 01:43.895
-That was... I'm sorry.
-Oh, it's fine.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.190
No kid gloves needed.

01:47.315 --> 01:48.316
Thanks.

01:49.025 --> 01:50.860
Okay. I'll see you soon?

01:51.236 --> 01:52.237
I hope so.

01:54.447 --> 01:55.490
Hey.

01:55.573 --> 01:57.158
This came from a friend at NCU

01:57.242 --> 01:59.661
who applied for, like, a medical study
a few months ago.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.330
He didn't get picked up, but...

02:05.375 --> 02:07.794
That address is to
an L-Corp subsidiary.

02:07.877 --> 02:10.755
I know you said that my source for
that last article was wrong, but...

02:11.506 --> 02:13.174
You think it's worth
taking a second look?

02:13.967 --> 02:16.427
Did I cover okay about training
and everything?

02:16.511 --> 02:18.388
-Did I blow it?
-No. No.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.598
I'm still getting used
to lying to Alex, too.

02:20.682 --> 02:23.017
And don't worry,
you'll get better at the whole

02:23.101 --> 02:24.769
sneaking out thing. The key

02:25.061 --> 02:26.062
-is subtlety.

02:29.190 --> 02:30.400
Case in point.
Hi, Brainy.

02:31.776 --> 02:33.862
It's Barney.

02:33.945 --> 02:35.155
Barney?

02:35.238 --> 02:37.115
-Yes, Barney.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.075
Thought it best
we keep a low profile.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.286
Considering where we're going.
Welcome to the Fortress of Solitude.

02:58.928 --> 03:01.139
I mean, it sure beats
the hell out of your loft.

03:01.222 --> 03:03.975
-Hey, that place is rent controlled.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.476
And this works great for training.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.353
Plus, you have Kelex, too.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.898
I did not know
we would be receiving guests.

03:10.648 --> 03:12.650
You have a robot?

03:12.984 --> 03:14.944
Caretaker Android Mark IV,

03:15.028 --> 03:16.404
with many other functions.

03:16.487 --> 03:19.574
Kelex, this is Nia Nal.
Give her anything she needs.

03:19.657 --> 03:22.827
And I think Lois already
introduced you to Brainy, right?

03:23.828 --> 03:25.038
Hello, Kleenex.

03:25.121 --> 03:27.206
It's Kelex, Querl.

03:27.874 --> 03:31.252
Don't you have to dust
the cosmic anvil or something?

03:36.174 --> 03:38.885
Okay. Holler if you need me.

03:43.890 --> 03:44.933
It's been weeks

03:45.725 --> 03:47.227
and now you agree to see me?

03:48.144 --> 03:49.187
Why now?

03:50.688 --> 03:53.358
Well, let's just say
prison has changed me.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.152
So, be honest...

03:58.321 --> 04:00.114
What do you think of the hair?

04:00.198 --> 04:01.866
Look, you lost someone,

04:02.450 --> 04:03.952
I know how that feels.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.704
Let me help you.

04:07.330 --> 04:10.083
You think I'm good, deep down, eh?

04:11.209 --> 04:13.169
Well, it's a bad time
to be a good man.

04:14.379 --> 04:15.755
Take you, for instance.

04:15.838 --> 04:17.507
If it weren't for
your bloody promise,

04:17.590 --> 04:20.426
I believe you could solve
all the world's problems.

04:20.885 --> 04:22.595
You just need...

04:23.763 --> 04:25.014
motivation.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.615
This is Hat.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.117
We go way back.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.368
Hello.

04:46.411 --> 04:47.829
Why are you doing this?

04:48.830 --> 04:50.623
I wanted to thank you in person.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.711
I was thinking small.
Hell-bent on getting Lockwood.

04:54.794 --> 04:55.795
Petty revenge.

04:55.878 --> 04:57.672
But I've got bigger fish to murder.

04:58.589 --> 05:00.466
And you can't stop me, old man.

05:00.550 --> 05:01.801
Don't do this.

05:01.884 --> 05:04.470
Thanks for the chat, mate.
Cheered me right up.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.313
Shall I teleport us out, then?

05:13.396 --> 05:15.315
No, not yet.
I gotta make another stop.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.859
I can't take us anywhere
I haven't been before.

05:18.568 --> 05:20.611
-We'll have to do it the hard way.
- Move, move, move!

05:20.695 --> 05:22.030
When's that ever stopped us?

05:22.196 --> 05:23.781
Come on, let's get 'em!

05:23.906 --> 05:27.327
Back up! Drop your weapons!
Drop your weapons!

05:27.410 --> 05:28.453
All out of guns?

05:29.078 --> 05:31.414
Thought you'd like something dashing.

05:31.914 --> 05:33.916
Freeze! Down on the ground.

05:54.812 --> 05:56.147
Naughty.

05:57.857 --> 05:58.900
Hey.

06:07.617 --> 06:10.995
So, what's important enough for you
to jeopardize our thrilling escape?

06:13.081 --> 06:14.832
A bloody jacket? Why?

06:15.583 --> 06:17.502
It's dashing.

06:20.421 --> 06:21.881
Long time no see.

06:22.590 --> 06:23.674
Who's Clockwork Orange?

06:23.758 --> 06:25.718
What's the line?
"No man is a failure..."

06:25.802 --> 06:26.803
"Who has friends."

06:34.811 --> 06:36.771
-I thought we captured you.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.773
She says that was a different Morae.

06:38.856 --> 06:40.608
They all look alike to you.

06:42.527 --> 06:43.653
There you are.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.488
Nice to finally meet you.

06:46.781 --> 06:47.907
Menagerie?

06:47.990 --> 06:49.742
You thought you could cut off
the head of the snake?

06:50.493 --> 06:51.619
We're tougher than that.

06:52.995 --> 06:53.996
Uh-uh-uh.

06:54.455 --> 06:55.706
Let him go.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.542
Why would we?
It's war.

06:57.625 --> 07:01.170
You know those alien-hating racists
been coming out of their hidey holes?

07:02.004 --> 07:03.422
We're gonna make 'em dead.

07:04.340 --> 07:05.591
-Right, then.

07:06.676 --> 07:07.802
Manchester!
I'm gonna find them.

07:13.057 --> 07:14.267
Not without me.

07:23.192 --> 07:25.361
You have anticipatory dreams.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.489
I have differential calculus.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.160
Both are predictive, but...

07:34.203 --> 07:35.621
You need to be adaptive, too.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.175
I learnt that from my friend, Val.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.468
One of your Legion friends?

07:49.302 --> 07:50.887
So, him, I'm allowed to know about?

07:51.762 --> 07:53.890
Brainy, you knew one of
my descendants in the future,

07:53.973 --> 07:55.683
but you won't tell me
a thing about her.
But if I knew the full scope
of what she could do--

07:58.394 --> 07:59.604
Absolutely not!

08:00.938 --> 08:03.357
Nia, we could create a paradox.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.152
-Destroy the very fabric...
-Fabric of space-time.

08:06.736 --> 08:07.987
Where have I heard that before?

08:11.115 --> 08:12.366
What is it?

08:12.700 --> 08:13.826
What's wrong?

08:14.994 --> 08:16.370
Pull up the footage.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.414
-This is live.

08:18.956 --> 08:19.957
Rio.

08:22.126 --> 08:23.419
<i>We wanna send a message...</i>

08:23.503 --> 08:26.422
-<i> Low angle? Are you insane?</i>
<i>-What?</i>

08:27.924 --> 08:29.759
<i>We are live from a secret army base</i>

08:29.842 --> 08:32.553
where mercenaries torture aliens
when they get bored.

08:34.180 --> 08:35.932
They killed four of ours.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.768
So we killed one...

08:40.019 --> 08:41.312
Two...

08:42.480 --> 08:43.648
Thirteen of theirs.

08:46.442 --> 08:48.819
<i>From now on, we terminate prejudice</i>

08:48.903 --> 08:50.279
with extreme prejudice.

08:56.285 --> 08:57.954
Like and subscribe.

09:02.583 --> 09:03.751
I'll track them.

09:03.834 --> 09:06.379
Kryptonian technology
is far superior to Earth's,

09:06.462 --> 09:09.131
with, of course,
the clear exception of Kelex.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.467
I've seen hats like that before.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.469
They use Fifth Dimensional energy.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.804
Untraceable.

09:16.055 --> 09:19.016
We are trying to keep up,
but they are just moving so fast.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.394
Outmatched by a freakin' hat.

09:21.769 --> 09:24.063
I'll talk to the Joint Chiefs,
see if they want us overseas.

09:24.146 --> 09:25.523
No, I'll handle that.

09:25.606 --> 09:27.858
I need to also make sure
Ms. Luthor is settled in.

09:27.942 --> 09:29.902
-I can take that off your plate.
-Okay.

09:33.447 --> 09:35.741
Where is the gel electrophoresis
apparatus?

09:36.075 --> 09:38.202
That would be in that room.
Third cabinet on the right.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.872
Well, this used to be my lab.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.249
I'm glad it's in good hands.
No, it's just for a couple of weeks.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.336
Unless you wanna change that
combat suit for a white coat?

09:48.254 --> 09:49.255
May I?

09:52.592 --> 09:55.511
Okay, so you are

09:56.804 --> 09:59.181
reducing mitophagy, and...

10:00.433 --> 10:03.477
increasing mitochondrial efficiency
at the same time?

10:03.894 --> 10:06.439
That would give muscle cells
the potential to...

10:09.442 --> 10:10.818
Okay, wait.

10:11.485 --> 10:13.321
That conversation at Thanksgiving?

10:13.571 --> 10:15.281
That wasn't theoretical?

10:15.573 --> 10:17.325
You're giving people powers.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.619
Management is such a waste
of your talents.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.079
Lena, this is huge.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.332
And it's dangerous.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.334
I mean, we need to up your security,

10:26.417 --> 10:28.711
we need to make sure that your
reports are put on a protected--

10:28.794 --> 10:30.254
I'm not gonna be writing any reports.

10:32.048 --> 10:33.841
What do you mean, you're not?

10:33.924 --> 10:34.967
You made a deal with the government.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.344
The deal is non-reciprocal.

10:36.427 --> 10:37.970
It's for products, not procedures.

10:38.512 --> 10:41.307
Which is a good thing because
I don't trust governments as a rule.

10:41.682 --> 10:44.894
-I'm the government.
-Well, I sure hope that's not true.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.524
Alex, it's not personal.

10:52.068 --> 10:53.361
I promise.

11:06.374 --> 11:07.625
Ben Lockwood?

11:07.875 --> 11:10.002
Wow. Hey. Welcome to D.C.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.295
Yeah, who should I make it out to?

11:11.379 --> 11:13.506
The guy whose phone calls
you've been dodging.

11:13.589 --> 11:14.840
Oh.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.635
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

11:17.718 --> 11:19.387
It's all good. I'm Cooper.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.639
Serving the Children of Liberty
in our nation's capital,

11:21.722 --> 11:23.933
-and areas surrounding.
-Right on. Thanks.

11:26.310 --> 11:27.895
Jack, three fingers.

11:29.688 --> 11:32.316
We've been keeping
Liberty's torch lit, so to speak.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.485
You know, taking care of things
while you were...

11:35.027 --> 11:36.779
-Well, you know.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.657
I came to say,
I'm on the ground with the boys

11:40.658 --> 11:44.286
and they don't love
your conduct of late.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.372
Well, I got...

11:46.455 --> 11:48.958
good news for the boys.
I'm about to meet with

11:49.041 --> 11:51.168
the President of the United States.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.421
Manchester Black is running free

11:53.504 --> 11:55.714
and you're here with the suits
on Capitol Hill?

11:55.798 --> 11:57.466
-Wait.  What?
-You didn't know?

11:57.550 --> 11:58.884
Yeah, he broke out.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.387
This is exactly my point, Professor.

12:01.470 --> 12:03.139
Okay, when this whole thing started,

12:03.222 --> 12:05.724
you were downright scary.

12:06.350 --> 12:07.476
But now...

12:09.103 --> 12:11.730
I got a dog back home, Max,
great dog.

12:12.606 --> 12:14.275
The day we neutered him,

12:15.651 --> 12:17.278
he didn't bark the same no more.

12:17.361 --> 12:18.362
Okay, yeah.

12:18.446 --> 12:21.449
Nobody is gonna follow this.

12:25.327 --> 12:26.871
Put his on my tab.

12:30.207 --> 12:32.877
<i>Who are Manchester Black</i>
<i>and his cohorts?</i>

12:32.960 --> 12:34.545
<i>To some, they're terrorists.</i>
<i>To others, they're a force for good,</i>

12:36.297 --> 12:39.175
<i>fighting against alien discrimination</i>
<i>worldwide.</i>

12:40.342 --> 12:42.052
<i>Every action</i>
<i>has an opposite and equal.</i>

12:42.803 --> 12:47.558
<i>Yeah? This "Earth first"</i>
<i>Liberty crowd,</i>

12:48.476 --> 12:49.935
<i>they hurt aliens,</i>

12:50.895 --> 12:53.022
<i>and, what, they don't think</i>
<i>we'll hurt them in kind?</i>

12:53.647 --> 12:54.648
That's London.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.358
And it looks like
they stole the crown jewels
to make a bigger statement.

12:58.277 --> 13:01.280
<i>Why? 'Cause Supergirl says</i>
<i>that's not the way.</i>

13:01.864 --> 13:03.741
Supergirl's like a folktale.

13:04.241 --> 13:07.203
In theory, competent, noble.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.787
<i>In reality, ooh,</i>

13:09.121 --> 13:12.958
ill-equipped, and clinging to ideals
of a time long past.

13:15.711 --> 13:17.046
When they go low,

13:17.922 --> 13:19.423
she goes high.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.759
-We put them six feet lower.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.386
<i>We're through giving these devils</i>
<i>the benefit of the law.</i>

13:24.470 --> 13:25.930
Supergirl's done.

13:26.722 --> 13:29.308
This is the era

13:30.226 --> 13:31.393
of the Elite.

13:33.812 --> 13:36.482
Now, while I flatter myself,

13:36.857 --> 13:40.361
my guess is the girl of yesterday
is watching somewhere.

13:40.444 --> 13:42.821
Hands on her hips
in the name of justice.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.115
<i>Well, she can come meet me,</i>
<i>face to face.</i>

13:45.199 --> 13:46.534
Dawn.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.285
Come alone.

13:49.703 --> 13:50.871
I hope you can make it.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.957
<i>That's what you're all about, right?</i>

13:53.123 --> 13:54.250
<i>Hope.</i>

13:55.793 --> 13:57.545
<i>Now for a commercial break.</i>

14:01.048 --> 14:02.883
You cannot trust them.
It'll be a trap.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.510
It wouldn't be the first one
I walked into.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.345
He didn't even say where to meet.

14:06.428 --> 14:08.305
That flash at the end of the message

14:08.389 --> 14:10.182
had an image coded in it.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.725
A map only I could see.

14:11.976 --> 14:14.562
Superluminous stimuli embedded in
structured light.

14:15.312 --> 14:17.147
I don't want to be impressed, but...

14:17.231 --> 14:19.358
-Where does he wanna meet?
-Manchester, England.

14:19.733 --> 14:21.819
Guess he wanted home-court advantage.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.153
How long till dawn?

14:23.237 --> 14:25.614
Three hours, 21 minutes, 15 seconds.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.033
So we wait
and then I'll deal with them.

14:31.453 --> 14:33.038
FDR's.

14:33.581 --> 14:36.000
Used it to sign
the Labor Relations Act.

14:37.459 --> 14:39.545
Your dad was a union man, right?

14:40.129 --> 14:42.923
Oh, yes, sir. Through and through.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.675
Yeah. Come on.

14:44.758 --> 14:47.720
Mr. President, while I'm here, um...

14:48.304 --> 14:49.847
I speak for...

14:50.848 --> 14:53.100
I speak for a lot of people,
a lot of good people.

14:53.183 --> 14:55.269
People who are interested in service

14:55.352 --> 14:56.979
-and so I was thinking that--
-Service?

14:59.481 --> 15:00.566
-Uh--
-What are you saying?

15:00.983 --> 15:03.527
Well, you know how effective
my people can be

15:04.236 --> 15:05.905
and with the world where it is today,

15:06.363 --> 15:09.992
-and with the Elite being out there...
-Hmm.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.996
I want you to deputize
the Children of Liberty.

15:14.747 --> 15:15.915
What?

15:19.752 --> 15:21.337
I like your show, son.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.632
And I'm glad I can help you out
with a pardon,

15:25.174 --> 15:27.384
but I've got the situation
pretty well in hand.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.969
- All right?

15:29.053 --> 15:32.473
All you got to do
is look pretty for the cameras.

15:35.142 --> 15:36.435
Nice suit, by the way.

15:41.231 --> 15:42.650
I've made up my mind.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.402
You can't convince me to change it.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.488
I know you better than that.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.740
Just don't let him bring you down.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.995
Manchester got to you, didn't he?
At the prison.

15:56.956 --> 16:00.084
All I've wanted to do
since my father died is honor him.

16:01.585 --> 16:03.295
Live by his example.

16:03.504 --> 16:04.964
And you have.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.759
But I'm struggling, Kara.

16:10.386 --> 16:13.430
There's a duality in me
that's at war.

16:14.848 --> 16:17.559
I wanna be a man of peace,
just like my father, but...

16:18.268 --> 16:20.854
Every fiber of my being
is fighting against that.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.442
Being a manhunter
was part of my nature.

16:26.652 --> 16:31.365
Are you considering
picking back up the sword?

16:32.282 --> 16:33.659
I made a personal vow

16:33.826 --> 16:35.536
and I wouldn't take that lightly.

16:36.286 --> 16:37.788
Well, if you choose

16:37.913 --> 16:40.416
to join the fight
to bring the Elite to justice,

16:40.499 --> 16:42.584
I'm sure
your father would understand.

16:43.043 --> 16:45.546
Even Myr'nn joined the fight
against Reign.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.175
Manchester's baiting me.

16:51.301 --> 16:52.845
We're connected somehow.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.890
I think he can feel the rage
that lies within me.

16:58.058 --> 17:00.894
Rage born of
the massacre of my family.

17:03.564 --> 17:04.940
One thing's for certain,

17:05.024 --> 17:06.817
Manchester was a test for me.

17:07.526 --> 17:10.529
But, whether he's test of my resolve,
or just a mirror

17:11.321 --> 17:14.450
showing me that I cannot walk
my father's path, I just don't know.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.910
You will find clarity, J'onn.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.039
I know you will.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.249
Thank you.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.502
Do you want me to come with you?

17:25.586 --> 17:27.504
I think I need to do this alone.

17:28.505 --> 17:30.674
There's a reason
he brought the fight to me.

17:31.216 --> 17:32.384
I'm a symbol.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.137
He wants this.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.892
-Kelex.
- Nia Nal.

17:39.975 --> 17:42.311
It's nice to see you
without that bore, Querl.

17:42.936 --> 17:46.023
This star has died
and there, a new one emerges.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.067
So, you know about this stuff?

17:48.275 --> 17:49.526
Other systems?

17:50.903 --> 17:51.904
Planets?

17:51.987 --> 17:53.989
If I'm interpreting
your intimations correctly,

17:54.156 --> 17:56.283
you seek information on your species.

17:56.658 --> 17:59.161
Shouldn't you ask
your pompous Coluan friend?

17:59.244 --> 18:02.206
Brainy wants to keep all that
under wraps.

18:03.332 --> 18:06.168
But if I'm supposed to fight,
I need to know what I'm capable of.

18:07.836 --> 18:10.130
The only other person
who could have told me is...

18:11.256 --> 18:12.382
gone.

18:12.841 --> 18:15.219
Your timeline is likely
extra-Lorentzian,

18:15.302 --> 18:17.888
and not as subject to paradox
as one might think.

18:18.347 --> 18:21.517
But there are still risks to
divulging this type of information.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.895
Well, Supergirl said anything I need.

18:24.978 --> 18:26.188
Didn't she?

18:27.356 --> 18:28.482
Those were her orders.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.360
Then tell me about Naltor.

18:32.653 --> 18:35.697
Tell me about everything I can do.

18:43.247 --> 18:44.998
You could have just used the door.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.918
And you could stop killing people.
Please, but no tricks.

18:50.754 --> 18:53.298
If anything happens to me,
the more I will start killing.

18:54.424 --> 18:59.805
So, what? We're just gonna sit here
and do the diner scene from <i>Heat?</i>

18:59.888 --> 19:01.098
Ah, no, no.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.976
Ah, Pacino, De Niro,

19:04.810 --> 19:06.311
they came alone.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.565
They're just for my protection.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.079
It's a little gaudy for me.

19:25.455 --> 19:27.374
Hey, that's my fee.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.793
I thought you were all about
your vendetta.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.670
Ben Lockwood...

19:32.087 --> 19:34.006
-Fiona?
-Why'd you think I came here?

19:35.215 --> 19:36.925
Brought her things to her family.

19:37.467 --> 19:38.886
Lockwood's time will come,

19:38.969 --> 19:41.305
but this is about me and you.

19:42.431 --> 19:45.017
You won't join us
and I can't beat you, so,

19:45.100 --> 19:47.352
-let's make a deal.
-I accept your surrender.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.938
Never.
But I can stay out of your soup.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.983
Cat in a tree, idiot in tights,
bank robbers, all yours.

19:53.066 --> 19:56.904
But the racists, the fascists,
the Children of Liberty...

19:57.863 --> 20:00.866
-that's our department.
-I won't let you keep killing people.

20:00.949 --> 20:03.202
Oh, like your government
intends to kill people?

20:04.286 --> 20:05.495
You really don't know, do you?

20:05.829 --> 20:07.748
Next week, your beloved government

20:07.831 --> 20:10.584
is launching a satellite that will
shoot down any alien spacecraft

20:10.667 --> 20:13.212
-trying to enter our atmosphere.
-That's impossible.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.838
I have it on good authority.

20:14.922 --> 20:17.382
Hat kidnaps secret agent types,
learns what they're up to.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.718
That's why we formed
this band of merry men.

20:21.261 --> 20:22.721
Sorry. Merry people.

20:22.804 --> 20:24.306
Why should I believe you?

20:24.389 --> 20:26.642
Talk to your mate, Baker.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.061
You know, the bloke who just pardoned

20:29.144 --> 20:31.230
the Grand bloody Wizard
of the Children of Liberty.

20:31.813 --> 20:33.690
Ask him about Operation Claymore.

20:33.774 --> 20:35.400
And then ask yourself,

20:36.360 --> 20:38.487
what if it were your ship
they were blowing up?

20:38.695 --> 20:40.280
You came here in a rocket,

20:40.447 --> 20:43.075
child in a basket, you know,
real Moses stuff.

20:43.617 --> 20:47.079
Here's your chance to tell the bosses
to "Let your people go."

20:48.372 --> 20:50.249
Or, us plagues will do it for you.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.090
Mr. President.

20:58.757 --> 20:59.967
We need to talk.

21:04.888 --> 21:07.849
I will not apologize
for protecting my country.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.351
But that's why you have me.

21:09.434 --> 21:11.353
That may have sufficed
for Olivia Marsdin,

21:11.436 --> 21:12.437
not anymore.

21:12.521 --> 21:13.855
Everyone involved in Claymore,

21:13.939 --> 21:17.276
everyone that works at
that satellite base is at risk.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.028
The Elite are going to attack.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.281
If I closed every military base

21:22.572 --> 21:24.157
that might be threatened,

21:24.241 --> 21:25.867
I'd have no bases left.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.537
And last I checked,
I don't answer to you.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.374
Will you answer to your electorate

21:32.457 --> 21:34.960
the first time Claymore
shoots down an alien ship

21:35.043 --> 21:36.253
that means us no harm?

21:36.712 --> 21:39.840
It's wrong. Innocent people will die!

21:39.923 --> 21:42.551
Do no interfere with that satellite.

21:44.052 --> 21:46.054
This is a mistake, Mr. President.

21:55.897 --> 21:57.691
Go to Scrambler Code 187.

22:00.068 --> 22:03.030
General, move the Claymore launch
up to tomorrow night.

22:03.739 --> 22:05.532
And double the guard
at Devils Tower.

22:17.544 --> 22:20.130
It was fine. It was a photo op.

22:20.213 --> 22:22.174
I wore the suit and...

22:22.758 --> 22:25.385
Yeah, that probably was
a little bit much.

22:25.469 --> 22:28.013
There was this guy at the hotel
who, uh...

22:29.014 --> 22:30.932
Doesn't matter, Lydia. Um...

22:32.851 --> 22:37.814
You know what, sweetheart,
I just keep hearing Dad's voice

22:38.815 --> 22:41.318
in my head, and he's telling me
that I'm an idiot

22:42.319 --> 22:44.321
for rubbing elbows
with all these politicians,

22:44.404 --> 22:47.365
when I started the
Children of Liberty to help people,

22:47.449 --> 22:48.617
real people.

22:49.367 --> 22:50.952
Am I still doing that?

22:51.703 --> 22:52.704
Or have...

22:54.206 --> 22:57.167
Yeah, anyway, uh...

22:57.292 --> 22:59.753
How are you doing? How's George?
I wanted to talk to you about...

23:00.921 --> 23:02.506
<i>Your message has reached its limit.</i>

23:14.559 --> 23:16.019
Come on.

23:17.854 --> 23:19.106
Come on.

23:21.608 --> 23:22.651
No.

23:23.652 --> 23:27.948
No. No. No. No. No.
Bad astral projection.

23:31.701 --> 23:32.702
Hmm.

23:37.541 --> 23:39.000
You went behind my back.

23:39.334 --> 23:41.878
You took advantage
of that simpleton, Kelex.

23:43.171 --> 23:45.257
And now you're astral projecting.

23:46.633 --> 23:48.552
That jumps months of training.

23:48.844 --> 23:50.387
I know, I'm sorry. I just...

23:51.930 --> 23:53.557
I moved too fast,
'cause it's what I do.

23:53.932 --> 23:55.892
I push myself,

23:55.976 --> 23:59.020
and I take on more than I can handle.
My mother always said it.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.356
But that's what heroes do.

24:02.816 --> 24:07.279
Leaping before one looks
is part of the job description.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.448
-It backfired.
-Yes.

24:10.532 --> 24:13.827
But next time,
you shall fire forward.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.018
I didn't know you made house calls.

24:40.353 --> 24:41.730
Your place is great.

24:45.066 --> 24:46.651
I'm here about Operation Claymore.

24:47.527 --> 24:50.113
The President is planning on
launching a satellite array that will

24:50.197 --> 24:53.158
blow up any alien spacecraft
entering our orbit.

24:53.366 --> 24:55.619
What? The DEO is supposed to be

24:55.702 --> 24:57.704
the first line of defense
against invasions.

24:57.787 --> 25:00.165
I mean, not some giant gun.

25:00.248 --> 25:01.958
-Is that even legal?
-I don't know.

25:02.667 --> 25:04.044
But I do know it's immoral.

25:05.879 --> 25:09.049
But everything I do means something
to people. So...

25:09.966 --> 25:13.678
if I stop the satellite,
I'm aligning myself with the Elite.

25:14.012 --> 25:17.515
And on the other hand,
if I let the launch happen,

25:17.599 --> 25:19.976
what does that say to
the Children of Liberty?
Why does it feel like
there are only two choices?

25:23.521 --> 25:25.273
But aren't you on your own side?

25:25.607 --> 25:28.693
Yes.  Alone.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.114
-Sometimes, it feels like--
-Screaming into the void.

25:34.574 --> 25:37.118
That's something my sister said.

25:37.786 --> 25:41.915
Look, you can only do
what you feel is right.

25:42.582 --> 25:43.708
Yeah.

25:48.546 --> 25:49.881
Come with me.

25:50.173 --> 25:51.424
Talk to the Marine Corp.

25:51.508 --> 25:54.135
You're the Director of the DEO.
Throw your weight around.

25:54.552 --> 25:56.888
If I show up,
I would jeopardize my position

25:56.972 --> 25:59.432
and the whole organization
would be at risk.

26:01.017 --> 26:02.185
I can't.

26:02.519 --> 26:03.561
I understand.

26:16.241 --> 26:19.869
I'm just saying, maybe a prison
dye job wasn't the best move.

26:19.953 --> 26:21.705
Nor is base dealing, mate.

26:24.207 --> 26:25.625
Needed a third king.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.877
-Gin.
-Thought you'd never ask.

26:37.012 --> 26:38.263
What's that, girl?

26:38.972 --> 26:40.307
Trouble at the old mill?

26:41.349 --> 26:42.559
Right.

26:43.601 --> 26:47.105
You called it. Girl of steel
went straight to the President.

26:47.188 --> 26:49.274
Idiot moved the launch up
to tomorrow.

26:49.774 --> 26:51.359
Base is in Wyoming.
Devils Tower.

27:11.588 --> 27:14.090
-How did you know we were coming?
-Fish and chips.

27:15.133 --> 27:16.634
And tracking devices.

27:18.428 --> 27:21.097
-This ends now.

27:22.349 --> 27:23.558
You're still outnumbered.

27:24.267 --> 27:25.518
Count again.
Who's this then?

27:26.936 --> 27:28.146
You have the Elite,

27:29.397 --> 27:30.690
I have super friends.

27:31.649 --> 27:33.234
-Right.

27:38.365 --> 27:39.616
Oh, crap.

27:39.699 --> 27:40.867
I got you.

27:49.876 --> 27:50.877
Ouch.

27:58.676 --> 27:59.677
Oi.

28:00.345 --> 28:01.846
Go after the Martian.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.439
-Rad.
- Rad!

28:13.149 --> 28:16.736
I built the gloves to harness
raw dream energy. So, yes,

28:16.820 --> 28:18.738
it's quite rad.

28:19.906 --> 28:21.908
You're safe now. Get out of here.

28:30.625 --> 28:31.668
Go on.

28:31.751 --> 28:32.961
Turn the other cheek.

28:54.691 --> 28:55.984
Director Danvers.

28:56.985 --> 28:58.403
I did what I thought was right.

29:03.825 --> 29:05.076
J'onn.

29:05.160 --> 29:06.953
-The satellite.
-Right.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.229
-How'd you know where I--
-Dreams.

29:39.527 --> 29:41.446
-Differential calculus.

29:49.162 --> 29:50.371
Where's my ring?

29:50.455 --> 29:52.874
Sleight of hand, fam, like me.
You see...

29:54.000 --> 29:55.251
I'm just a distraction.

29:58.421 --> 30:01.090
Wait. Where's the Morae?

30:17.273 --> 30:18.900
Brainy, they started the launch.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.196
The controls are destroyed.
I can't do anything.

30:23.279 --> 30:25.073
Well, that was the plan. Wasn't it?

30:25.782 --> 30:27.158
<i> Launch initiated. </i>

30:27.242 --> 30:29.369
-What did you do?
-Picked my own target.

30:30.203 --> 30:31.746
-1600 Penn.

30:31.830 --> 30:32.831
The White House.

30:33.248 --> 30:36.751
Your government on fire,
hoisted by its own petard.

30:37.293 --> 30:39.337
As soon as it
reaches orbit, it will fire.

30:40.588 --> 30:42.757
There's a reason
it's called "playing God."

30:45.426 --> 30:46.719
It's fun.

30:49.597 --> 30:50.723
Fly.

31:03.152 --> 31:05.572
Wanna make me the happiest man
on Earth?

31:39.564 --> 31:41.441
Ah...

31:42.233 --> 31:44.652
There you are, J'onn J'onzz.

31:45.486 --> 31:47.280
Nice to finally meet you.

31:48.698 --> 31:50.783
I know why you called me now.

31:51.451 --> 31:52.869
You have a death wish.

32:07.133 --> 32:09.802
<i>Satellite has reached orbit.</i>

32:09.886 --> 32:10.929
<i>Firing in...</i>

32:12.096 --> 32:17.769
<i>...seven, six, five,</i>
<i>four, three, two...</i>

32:18.519 --> 32:19.604
<i>one.</i>

32:51.260 --> 32:52.428
You okay?

32:53.513 --> 32:54.931
That ring...

32:57.058 --> 32:58.226
was mine.

33:00.103 --> 33:01.270
And I lost it.

33:06.567 --> 33:07.652
Look...

33:08.611 --> 33:11.489
If you've taught me anything
the past couple days,

33:11.572 --> 33:14.117
it's that setbacks
will make you stronger.

33:14.867 --> 33:17.620
It's not about how your ring
was stolen, Brainy.

33:18.454 --> 33:20.415
It's about how
we're gonna get it back.

33:23.793 --> 33:26.087
Thank you, Nia Nal.

33:29.632 --> 33:30.717
How's your head?

33:31.634 --> 33:33.094
Don't worry about it.

33:33.177 --> 33:35.263
Just don't tell the President.

33:35.346 --> 33:36.681
You were never here.

33:38.975 --> 33:41.644
You did a good thing
destroying that satellite.

33:42.729 --> 33:44.522
Well, I couldn't have done it
without that suit.

33:44.731 --> 33:45.732
Hmm.

33:46.774 --> 33:48.276
But the Elite are still out there.

33:49.193 --> 33:50.361
Oh, we'll get 'em.

33:52.155 --> 33:53.948
Um, look...

33:54.615 --> 33:57.326
Officially, I know that we're not
really supposed to communicate.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.579
I'm not saying you can just show up
whenever you want,

33:59.662 --> 34:02.165
but, you know, occasionally,

34:03.082 --> 34:04.625
time to time, maybe

34:04.709 --> 34:06.419
-we could--
-Kick ass the way we used to.

34:07.420 --> 34:08.671
Something like that.

34:11.174 --> 34:12.675
I would really like that.

34:14.218 --> 34:16.387
Well, uh, wish me luck.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.473
I gotta go see a guy
about a satellite.

34:19.474 --> 34:21.017
-Good luck.

34:22.435 --> 34:25.688
That satellite array was created
to protect Americans.

34:25.772 --> 34:28.524
Not to mention that it cost
$2 billion!

34:28.608 --> 34:31.319
And now it's gone! And here we are.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.071
Yes, here we are.

34:34.280 --> 34:35.782
As well as your staff,

34:36.491 --> 34:38.242
your loved ones, thanks to me,

34:38.326 --> 34:41.120
wasn't leveled by a weapon
of its own government's creation.

34:41.496 --> 34:42.580
Come on.

34:43.289 --> 34:45.416
You can tell me. Hmm?

34:46.793 --> 34:48.461
You hated that satellite.

34:48.544 --> 34:50.379
You're a superhero.

34:50.463 --> 34:53.174
There had to have been a way to stop
Claymore without blowing it up.

34:54.801 --> 34:56.260
No, you did it

34:56.928 --> 34:58.304
because you wanted to.

34:58.679 --> 35:02.100
I assure you, sir,
there was no other way.

35:19.408 --> 35:21.285
Colonel, a word.

35:21.744 --> 35:22.745
This is not a good time.

35:23.329 --> 35:25.081
The next time
the government institutes

35:25.164 --> 35:27.458
a secret extraterrestrial
defense program,

35:27.542 --> 35:29.627
I would appreciate
being part of the conversation.

35:29.752 --> 35:32.130
Operation Claymore should have been
DEO purview.

35:32.505 --> 35:34.590
If I'm not briefed
on matters of national security,

35:34.674 --> 35:36.592
-then I can't do my job.
-Just a moment.

35:37.009 --> 35:38.177
I didn't know.

35:39.762 --> 35:40.763
Sorry?

35:41.639 --> 35:43.391
The President acted against protocol.

35:44.934 --> 35:46.477
I was never informed.

35:53.025 --> 35:55.486
So, that results...

35:56.070 --> 35:58.656
in a 2% increase...  Oh, my God!

35:58.739 --> 36:01.159
-Jesus.
-Um, what happened?

36:01.576 --> 36:03.327
Oh... It's fine.

36:04.537 --> 36:05.830
-Um...

36:08.875 --> 36:10.334
I think you're right.

36:11.085 --> 36:12.920
There is something wrong
with this government.

36:13.629 --> 36:15.590
-I thought you were the government?
-No.

36:16.090 --> 36:17.091
I'm your friend.

36:17.425 --> 36:19.385
And, right now, I have
a hell of a lot more faith in you

36:19.468 --> 36:20.511
than I do in them.

36:20.595 --> 36:22.638
So, whatever you need...

36:23.848 --> 36:24.932
I'm here.

36:26.267 --> 36:27.310
Good.

36:27.977 --> 36:29.353
That I can trust.

36:30.146 --> 36:31.898
Come back tomorrow
and we'll give you the real tour.

36:36.944 --> 36:37.987
Ben.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.781
I'm glad you made the second trip.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.074
I really appreciate it.

36:42.491 --> 36:44.785
Of course, Mr. President.

36:46.204 --> 36:49.081
A lot of things going on today.
A lot of movin' parts.

36:49.540 --> 36:51.375
Mmm, I can believe it, sir.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.961
Of course you do. Belief,

36:55.004 --> 36:56.130
loyalty.

36:56.672 --> 36:57.757
It's important, hmm?

36:59.508 --> 37:03.054
Maybe not to certain
caped individuals.

37:03.846 --> 37:05.389
See, I've been thinking, Ben,

37:06.432 --> 37:10.061
I may not be able to deputize
all of your Children of Liberty,

37:10.895 --> 37:12.730
but I can deputize one.

37:13.397 --> 37:16.150
How would you like to be
my next Director of Alien Affairs?

37:17.652 --> 37:18.653
What?

37:19.362 --> 37:20.404
Wow.

37:22.615 --> 37:23.616
Uh...

37:23.783 --> 37:26.202
We could use a man like you.

37:26.661 --> 37:28.996
A man who knows what he is.

37:32.625 --> 37:34.669
An asset to this administration.

37:35.795 --> 37:36.879
It's unbelievable.

37:36.963 --> 37:40.675
Yeah, the President is making some
very strange decisions lately.

37:40.758 --> 37:42.343
The Lockwood appointment,

37:43.261 --> 37:44.387
the satellite...

37:45.554 --> 37:47.056
-How do you...
-Brainy told me.

37:48.015 --> 37:49.016
We get brunch.

37:49.350 --> 37:50.518
-Cute.
-Yeah.

37:50.893 --> 37:51.894
Yeah.

37:52.728 --> 37:54.939
My instincts were all over the place
on this one.

37:55.022 --> 37:56.190
Didn't know which way was up.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.734
Still not sure if I do.

38:00.403 --> 38:01.404
Yeah, I know the feeling,

38:01.487 --> 38:04.198
I got this story I'm not sure
if I should pursue myself.

38:07.660 --> 38:08.661
How'd you figure it out?

38:08.911 --> 38:10.454
Examined my motives.

38:10.997 --> 38:15.001
Made sure the decision I was making
was for the right reasons.

38:16.210 --> 38:17.837
And not the selfish ones.

38:20.256 --> 38:21.841
I guess that's all
we can do really, right?

38:23.592 --> 38:24.719
Yeah.

38:26.387 --> 38:29.682
Speaking of which,
I've got another article to write.

38:30.224 --> 38:31.225
Type fast.

38:31.934 --> 38:33.352
Super-speed.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.232
Mackenzie.
Hey, um...

38:45.114 --> 38:46.324
That source that you were mentioning,

38:46.407 --> 38:48.159
do you think he'd be willing
to speak on the record?

38:51.495 --> 38:53.581
You all saw
the exact same thing I did.

38:53.664 --> 38:56.417
We need boots on the ground,
not wingtips on a dias--

38:56.500 --> 39:00.671
Uh, gentlemen. Sorry, I didn't realize
that we were meeting until...

39:00.755 --> 39:03.257
My fault. Must have forgot.

39:04.592 --> 39:07.345
These here are all the folks who've
been holding the fort down in...

39:07.428 --> 39:09.347
Well, let's see. Nor'east,

39:09.930 --> 39:11.932
Carolinas, Gulf,

39:12.641 --> 39:14.894
New Mexico. This is Ben Lockwood.

39:15.644 --> 39:18.314
I'm sorry, is it Director Lockwood?

39:18.397 --> 39:21.108
This kinda looks
a lot like my mask, Coop.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.943
Well, we're all Agent Liberty.

39:23.903 --> 39:25.112
It's like you said, isn't it?

39:26.739 --> 39:28.115
Doesn't matter who we are,

39:29.158 --> 39:30.659
doesn't matter who leads.

39:31.952 --> 39:34.080
-Sure, um--
-Except I think it might!

39:34.163 --> 39:36.540
Agent means you act.

39:37.875 --> 39:39.335
And we're all feeling

39:40.252 --> 39:41.670
like you're all talk.

39:42.171 --> 39:43.547
No action.

39:44.090 --> 39:46.884
The Children of Liberty need a leader
who inspires them.

39:47.301 --> 39:49.970
Someone strong and powerful.

40:12.159 --> 40:13.994
Is anyone else entertaining
a change in leadership?

40:16.372 --> 40:18.541
No? Good.

40:19.834 --> 40:21.293
Let's proceed.
