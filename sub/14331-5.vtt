08:24.337 --> 08:26.439
THIS IS THE
WORST DAY OF MY LIFE.

08:26.505 --> 08:27.573
- [crying]

08:27.640 --> 08:29.976
ONE OF THE BIRDS
BIT MY EAR!

08:30.042 --> 08:33.011
- THIS IS TERRIBLE.
OH, I KNOW!

08:33.078 --> 08:37.183
WHAT IF WE JUST DON'T TELL
THIS JORGEN FELLOW THAT WE KNOW?

08:37.250 --> 08:38.818
- IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

08:38.885 --> 08:41.453
- ACTUALLY, SPORT,
IT IS THAT SIMPLE.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.621
IF JORGEN
NEVER FINDS OUT

08:42.688 --> 08:44.190
THAT YOUR PARENTS
KNOW ABOUT US,

08:44.256 --> 08:45.658
WE CAN STAY!

08:45.725 --> 08:48.261
- REALLY?
PLEASE, MOM AND DAD,

08:48.327 --> 08:49.996
YOU GOTTA
HELP ME KEEP THE SECRET.

08:50.062 --> 08:53.065
WANDA, COSMO, AND POOF
ARE MORE THAN JUST MY FAIRIES,

08:53.132 --> 08:54.367
THEY'RE LIKE FAMILY.

08:54.433 --> 08:57.169
- TIMMY, YOUR SECRET'S
SAFE WITH ME.

08:57.236 --> 08:58.804
- WHAT ABOUT YOU, DAD?

08:58.871 --> 09:01.374
- GET ME A CRAZY STRAW FOR
MY NUTTY LEMONADE, AND I'M IN!

09:01.440 --> 09:03.676
- POOF! POOF!
- YAY!

09:03.743 --> 09:06.746
- THIS IS AWESOME!
I GET TO KEEP MY FAIRIES!

09:06.812 --> 09:08.447
WE'LL BE LIKE ONE,
BIG, HAPPY FAMILY

09:08.514 --> 09:10.149
AND JORGEN
WILL NEVER KNOW!

09:10.216 --> 09:12.618
- [angry voice] TURNER!

09:12.685 --> 09:14.754
- AAH! IT'S JORGEN!
QUICK, GUYS!

09:14.820 --> 09:16.289
HIDE MY PARENTS.

09:16.355 --> 09:17.356
- AND MY NUTS!

09:20.493 --> 09:21.761
[explosion]

09:21.827 --> 09:24.530
- TIMMY TURNER,
YOU'RE IN TERRIBLE TROUBLE!

09:24.597 --> 09:26.866
THERE IS NO EXCUSE
FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!

09:26.933 --> 09:28.668
- JORGEN, I CAN EXPLAIN.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.536
I GOT A LITTLE CARELESS,
AND I MESSED UP.

09:30.603 --> 09:33.773
PLEASE DON'T
TAKE MY FAIRIES AWAY.

09:33.839 --> 09:35.408
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

09:35.474 --> 09:37.109
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

09:37.176 --> 09:39.412
- WHAT ARE <i> YOU</i>
TALKING ABOUT?

09:39.478 --> 09:41.314
- WHAT ARE <i> YOU</i> TALKING ABOUT?

09:41.380 --> 09:43.783
- WHAT ARE <i> YOU</i>
TALKING ABOUT?

09:43.849 --> 09:46.152
- WHAT ARE <i> YOU</i> TALKING ABOUT?

09:46.218 --> 09:47.820
- I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE FACT THAT YOU

09:47.887 --> 09:49.221
WISHED UP AN
AMUSEMENT PARK

09:49.288 --> 09:51.357
IN YOUR BACKYARD
AND DIDN'T INVITE ME!

09:51.424 --> 09:53.759
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I LIKE THE SWAN BOATS.

09:53.826 --> 09:57.563
- YES, I DO.
AND I FEEL TERRIBLE.

09:57.630 --> 09:59.498
WHAT WAS
I THINKING, GUYS?

09:59.565 --> 10:00.967
[nervous laughter]

10:01.033 --> 10:02.168
- WHAT WAS HE THINKING?

10:02.234 --> 10:03.536
WELL, YOU SURE
WEREN'T THINKING

10:03.602 --> 10:05.371
THAT YOUR PARENTS
FOUND OUT YOU HAD FAIRIES.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.139
UNH! AAH!

10:08.441 --> 10:10.509
[nervous laughter]

10:10.576 --> 10:14.480
- HEH HEH. IT'S HARD TO LAUGH
WITH A BROKEN FUNNY BONE.

10:14.547 --> 10:17.550
- WAIT A MINUTE.
COSMO, WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

10:17.616 --> 10:19.051
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.320
THE BLOW TO THE HEAD ALSO
DESTROYED MY SHORT TERM MEMORY.

10:21.387 --> 10:23.189
JORGEN, WHEN
DID YOU GET HERE?

10:23.255 --> 10:25.858
- TURNER, SOMETHING
IS NOT RIGHT HERE.

10:25.925 --> 10:27.560
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S NOT RIGHT.

10:27.626 --> 10:29.395
THERE'S AN AMUSEMENT PARK
IN MY BACKYARD

10:29.462 --> 10:31.197
AND YOU'RE
NOT IN IT.

10:31.263 --> 10:33.599
- OH! I DO LOVE
AMUSEMENT PARKS.

10:33.666 --> 10:35.968
THE RIDES, THE GAMES,
THE SCREAMS OF TERROR

10:36.035 --> 10:37.169
FILLING THE AIR.

10:37.236 --> 10:39.372
PEOPLE VOMITING
INTO TRASH CANS.

10:39.438 --> 10:41.140
- YEAH, WELL,
IT'S OPEN 24 HOURS,

10:41.207 --> 10:43.776
SO THERE'S NO REASON
FOR YOU TO EVER COME BACK HERE.

10:43.843 --> 10:44.744
- POOF, POOF!

10:44.810 --> 10:46.412
- POOF WANTS TO GO TOO!

10:46.479 --> 10:48.381
- HERE'S A COUPLE
OF FAIRY FAST PASSES.

10:48.447 --> 10:50.082
- KNOCK YOURSELVES OUT, GUYS.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.250
- COME ON, POOF.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.451
- JUST PROMISE ME
YOU WON'T BE

10:52.518 --> 10:54.286
A SCAREDY-CAT
ON THE BIG BOY RIDES.

10:54.353 --> 10:55.321
- POOF, POOF.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.056
- YEAH, YOU
SAY THAT NOW.

10:58.457 --> 11:00.092
- PHEW!
THAT WAS CLOSE.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.128
COSMO, WHERE'D YOU
HIDE MY PARENTS?

11:02.194 --> 11:04.597
- WELL, I WAS GONNA
PUT THEM IN THE CLOSET,

11:04.663 --> 11:06.665
BUT THEN I THOUGHT,
"THAT'S CRAZY."

11:06.732 --> 11:08.567
SO I SHRUNK THEM DOWN
TO THE SIZE OF MICE

11:08.634 --> 11:10.002
THEN POOFED THEM
INTO THE FRONT YARD

11:10.069 --> 11:11.637
WHERE THAT VICIOUS
STRAY CAT'S BEEN LIVING.

11:11.704 --> 11:12.638
- WHAT?

11:12.705 --> 11:14.473
both: AAAH!

11:14.540 --> 11:15.941
[cat meowing]

11:16.008 --> 11:18.144
both: AAAH!

11:18.210 --> 11:20.513
[cat meowing]

11:20.579 --> 11:24.250
- AAH! I PICKED A BAD DAY
TO FILL MY POCKETS WITH SALMON!

11:29.588 --> 11:30.523
[cat meowing]

11:30.589 --> 11:32.158
both: AAH!

11:33.859 --> 11:35.294
both: AAH!

11:35.361 --> 11:38.297
- TIMMY, THERE'S
A GIANT CAT OUTSIDE!

11:38.364 --> 11:41.167
- EVEN WORSE, THE GRASS
IS, LIKE, TEN FEET TALL.

11:41.233 --> 11:43.135
OH, I NEVER SHOULD'VE
STOPPED MOWING IT.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.470
- IT'S OKAY, GUYS.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.906
YOU'RE SAFE, AND JORGEN
IS TOTALLY CLUELESS.

11:46.972 --> 11:48.207
MAN, AM I GLAD
THAT I DON'T HAVE TO HIDE

11:48.274 --> 11:50.142
MY SECRET FROM
YOU GUYS ANYMORE!

11:50.209 --> 11:52.144
- WELL, IT WAS
NICE MEETING YOU,

11:52.211 --> 11:54.213
BUT I DO HAVE
A LOT OF CHORES TO DO.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.748
I HAVE TO
WASH THE DISHES,

11:55.815 --> 11:58.551
DO THE LAUNDRY,
AND TAR THE DRIVEWAY.

11:58.617 --> 12:01.120
- AND I'VE GOTTA CONTINUE
TERRORIZING DINKLEBERG.

12:01.187 --> 12:02.354
[crazy laugh]

12:02.421 --> 12:03.856
- WAIT, MOM AND DAD.

12:03.923 --> 12:05.624
NOW THAT YOU
KNOW ABOUT MY FAIRIES,

12:05.691 --> 12:07.293
THEY CAN USE THEIR
MAGIC TO HELP YOU OUT.

12:07.359 --> 12:08.828
AS LONG AS WE
DON'T GET CARRIED AWAY.

12:08.894 --> 12:10.396
RIGHT, GUYS?

12:10.463 --> 12:13.666
- SURE, SPORT, WE'LL JUST
KEEP THINGS UNDER THE RADAR.

12:13.732 --> 12:16.302
- I WISH YOU'D HELP MY
PARENTS DO THEIR CHORES.

12:16.368 --> 12:18.037
- ABRACADABRA.

12:18.104 --> 12:19.271
- YOU NEVER SAY THAT.

12:19.338 --> 12:20.639
- WELL, THEY'RE NEW.

12:20.706 --> 12:22.775
I FIGURED I MIGHT
AS WELL SELL IT.

12:37.523 --> 12:39.959
- WOW, THAT'S
JUST LIKE MAGIC!

12:40.025 --> 12:44.029
- IT IS MAGIC.
THAT'S WHY I SAID ABRACADABRA.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.564
- WHAT ABOUT DINKLEBERG?

12:45.631 --> 12:48.267
- DINKLEBERG'S
NOT A MAGIC WORD!

12:48.334 --> 12:49.969
UNLESS IT'S ITALIAN.
IS IT, TIMMY?

12:50.035 --> 12:50.970
- JUST DO IT.

12:51.036 --> 12:52.671
- ABRACA-DINKLEBERG!

12:56.342 --> 12:58.777
- HEY, KITTY.
REMEMBER ME?

12:58.844 --> 13:00.546
I'M THE GUY WHO
ALWAYS LEAVES

13:00.613 --> 13:02.314
A SAUCER OF MILK
OUT FOR YOU.

13:05.918 --> 13:09.788
OH, MUFFIN, WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A MAGICAL ADVENTURE TOGETHER!

13:09.855 --> 13:12.691
ONWARD TO
THE RAINBOW FOREST!

13:12.758 --> 13:15.594
- GUH! TIMMY, YOUR
FAIRIES ARE AMAZING!

13:15.661 --> 13:18.264
THEY'RE WAY BETTER THAN THAT
LEPRECHAUN ACROSS THE STREET.

13:18.330 --> 13:20.266
- HONEY, WE'VE
BEEN OVER THIS.

13:20.332 --> 13:22.701
MR. SHANAHAN
ISN'T A LEPRECHAUN.

13:22.768 --> 13:24.937
HE'S A HORSE JOCKEY
AT THE RACE TRACK.

13:25.004 --> 13:26.639
- LIKELY STORY.

13:26.705 --> 13:29.975
I DON'T WANT
YOUR GOLD ANYMORE, SHANAHAN!

13:30.042 --> 13:31.510
I'VE GOT MAGICAL FAI--

13:31.577 --> 13:32.711
GUH!

13:32.778 --> 13:34.113
- SORRY, TIMMY'S DAD.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.782
BUT REMEMBER, WE
HAVE TO KEEP THINGS QUIET.

13:36.849 --> 13:37.883
- OH, OKAY.

13:37.950 --> 13:40.085
CAN I WISH FOR
SOME NEW MAKEUP?

13:40.152 --> 13:43.222
- OOH, AND I COULD REALLY USE
A NEW SET OF GOLF CLUBS.

13:43.289 --> 13:45.858
WITH A TALKING GOLF BALL,
SO I NEVER LOSE IT.

13:45.925 --> 13:47.993
- ANYTHING FOR
MY MOM AND DAD!

13:49.795 --> 13:51.864
- WOW, THIS IS WONDERFUL,

13:51.931 --> 13:55.100
BUT I REALLY
DON'T NEED THE MIRROR.

13:58.437 --> 14:00.673
- FORE!

14:00.739 --> 14:01.674
[high-pitched scream]

14:04.410 --> 14:06.712
- I'M UNDER THE
LIVING ROOM COUCH.

14:06.779 --> 14:07.846
- IT WORKS!

14:07.913 --> 14:09.915
- YOU SHOULD REALLY
DUST UNDER HERE.

14:09.982 --> 14:11.584
- LOSE THE ATTITUDE, BALL!

14:11.650 --> 14:13.118
- THANK YOU,
TIMMY'S FAIRIES!

14:13.185 --> 14:14.987
THIS IS WONDERFUL!

14:15.054 --> 14:16.755
- AND IT'S
JUST THE BEGINNING.

14:16.822 --> 14:19.291
MY FAIRIES CAN
GRANT ANY WISH YOU ASK FOR,

14:19.358 --> 14:21.427
AS LONG AS WE
KEEP IT FROM JORGEN.

14:21.493 --> 14:23.028
- I CANNOT SHAKE
THE FEELING THAT TURNER

14:23.095 --> 14:24.230
IS UP TO SOMETHING.

14:24.296 --> 14:25.598
HOLD ON, POOF.

14:25.664 --> 14:28.234
I AM GOING TO TURN
EVERYTHING BLACK AND WHITE.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.269
SOMETHING WASN'T
SITTING WELL WITH ME.

14:30.336 --> 14:31.804
AND IT WASN'T
JUST THE STALE CHURRO

14:31.870 --> 14:33.105
AND BIG PRETZEL
I HAD EATEN.

14:33.172 --> 14:34.840
- POOF, POOF?
- IT IS CALLED NARRATION.

14:34.907 --> 14:36.342
ALL DETECTIVES DO IT.

14:36.408 --> 14:39.144
I KNEW I WAS GOING TO
HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON TURNER.

14:39.211 --> 14:42.548
RIGHT AFTER I
RODE THE TIMMY TWISTER.

14:42.615 --> 14:45.217
- POOF! POOF!
- WHEE! YAH!

14:48.187 --> 14:50.889
- OOH! THE TALKING GUITAR
I WISHED FOR!

14:50.956 --> 14:52.424
[playing rock guitar tune]

14:52.491 --> 14:54.159
- YOUR FINGERS ARE COLD!

14:54.226 --> 14:55.894
- DON'T SASS ME, GUITAR!

14:55.961 --> 14:57.529
GO WAIT UNDER THE COUCH
WITH THE GOLF BALL!

14:57.596 --> 14:58.764
- TURNER!

14:58.831 --> 15:00.966
- AAH! IT'S JORGEN!
COSMO, QUICK!

15:01.033 --> 15:03.002
HIDE MY PARENTS!

15:03.068 --> 15:05.504
all: [screams]

15:05.571 --> 15:08.507
- HA! I HAVE DONE A LITTLE
DETECTIVE WORK, TURNER.

15:08.574 --> 15:09.808
I EVEN MADE THINGS
BLACK AND WHITE

15:09.875 --> 15:11.910
UNTIL I REALIZED
IT HID MY TAN.

15:11.977 --> 15:13.279
I HAVE DEDUCED
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN

15:13.345 --> 15:15.281
MAKING SOME
SUSPICIOUS WISHES.

15:15.347 --> 15:19.652
EXHIBIT "A,"
WHY DO YOU NEED MAKEUP?

15:19.718 --> 15:21.754
- TO HIGHLIGHT MY CHEEKBONES?

15:24.790 --> 15:27.159
- OKAY, I BUY THAT.

15:27.226 --> 15:29.161
BUT HOW DO YOU
EXPLAIN THIS CAPPUCCINO MAKER

15:29.228 --> 15:31.063
AND COPY OF
<i>HOUSE WIFE</i> MAGAZINE?

15:31.130 --> 15:32.498
- OH, THOSE ARE MINE.

15:32.564 --> 15:35.267
I LIKE TO SIP FANCY COFFEES
WHILE READING ARTICLES

15:35.334 --> 15:37.536
ABOUT HOW TO THROW
A DINNER PARTY ON A BUDGET.

15:37.603 --> 15:38.937
OH, LOOK!

15:39.004 --> 15:41.674
"20 FANCY CHEESE DISHES
TO PLEASE YOUR HUNGRY MAN!"

15:41.740 --> 15:43.208
- OKAY, CASE CLOSED.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.744
WHY DON'T YOU AND POOF
HEAD BACK TO THE AMUSEMENT PARK?

15:45.811 --> 15:48.480
I HEAR THE TURNER OF TERROR
IS REALLY COOL.

15:48.547 --> 15:51.984
- ALL RIGHT, BUT I WILL
BE WATCHING YOU, TURNER!

15:52.051 --> 15:53.452
[explosion]

15:53.519 --> 15:55.954
- PHEW, ANOTHER CLOSE CALL.

15:56.021 --> 15:57.856
COSMO, WHERE DID YOU
HIDE MY PARENTS?

15:57.923 --> 16:00.192
- WELL, I WAS JUST
GONNA THROW A BLANKET OVER THEM.

16:00.259 --> 16:02.594
BUT THEN I THOUGHT,
"THAT'S CRAZY."

16:02.661 --> 16:04.396
SO I SHRUNK THEM DOWN
TO THE SIZE OF ACORNS

16:04.463 --> 16:05.731
AND POOFED THEM
INTO THE TREE

16:05.798 --> 16:07.466
WHERE THAT
RABID SQUIRREL'S BEEN LIVING.

16:07.533 --> 16:10.803
- [screams]
- [growling]

16:10.869 --> 16:14.206
- I PICKED A BAD DAY TO FILL MY
POCKETS WITH SQUIRREL KIBBLE!

16:14.273 --> 16:16.775
both: [screaming]

16:16.842 --> 16:18.811
- TIMMY!
OH, THAT WAS TERRIFYING.

16:18.877 --> 16:21.213
MY ENTIRE LIFE
PASSED BEFORE MY EYES.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.214
AND IT WAS BORING!

16:22.281 --> 16:23.382
- DON'T WORRY, DAD.

16:23.449 --> 16:25.217
YOUR LIFE WON'T
BE BORING ANYMORE.

16:25.284 --> 16:26.618
THE SAME
GOES FOR YOU, MOM!

16:26.685 --> 16:29.321
'CAUSE YOU GUYS CAN WISH
FOR ANYTHING YOU WANT!

16:29.388 --> 16:30.456
both: ANYTHING?

16:30.522 --> 16:32.024
- ANYTHING.

16:32.091 --> 16:36.895
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
WELCOME TO <i> THE MOM SHOW.</i>

16:36.962 --> 16:39.164
AND NOW, YOU KNOW HER,
YOU LOVE HER,

16:39.231 --> 16:41.867
YOU CAN'T TAR YOUR
DRIVEWAY WITHOUT HER...

16:41.934 --> 16:43.068
MOM!

16:43.135 --> 16:46.205
- THANKS TIMMY!
HI, EVERYONE!

16:46.271 --> 16:48.040
I DON'T HAVE
ANY GUESTS TONIGHT

16:48.107 --> 16:49.308
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THEM

16:49.375 --> 16:52.778
TO TAKE THE ATTENTION
AWAY FROM ME.

16:52.845 --> 16:56.281
[all chanting]
MOM! MOM! MOM! MOM!

16:56.348 --> 16:57.850
- WE INTERRUPT THIS PROGRAM
FOR AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE

16:57.916 --> 16:59.418
FROM THE PRESIDENT
