00:28.696 --> 00:30.103
IC, Strand 126,

00:30.180 --> 00:31.755
we're gonna clear
the sixth floor

00:31.774 --> 00:32.865
before we evacuate.

00:33.016 --> 00:34.808
Any updates
on the second explosive?

00:34.960 --> 00:37.036
-(alarm blaring)
-(radio static)

00:37.538 --> 00:38.996

00:40.432 --> 00:41.415
Let's go.

(blaring continues)

00:47.214 --> 00:50.049

00:52.053 --> 00:54.011
Help! This guy needs help!

00:55.614 --> 00:58.373
TOMMY VEGA:
Sir, can you hear me?
Is this your father?

00:58.392 --> 01:01.060
No, I was looking for our mom.
I'm with my little sisters.

01:01.211 --> 01:02.877
-Guessing it's a heart attack.
-Okay.

01:02.897 --> 01:03.804
Judd, help 'em
carry this man down.

01:03.880 --> 01:04.971
-Son, what's your name?
-Jack.

01:05.124 --> 01:06.957
Hey, Jack. You gonna
go with them, alright?

01:06.975 --> 01:07.974
-But my sisters?
-Where are your sisters?

01:08.127 --> 01:09.551
Hiding in the room next door.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.070
Paul, get in and grab 'em.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.363
-PAUL STRICKLAND:
Copy that, Cap.
-TOMMY: TK, Nancy, go with them.

01:15.317 --> 01:16.133

01:17.803 --> 01:20.454

01:27.755 --> 01:30.589
And you're all dead.

01:30.666 --> 01:32.499
MATEO CHAVEZ:
Oh, man, I don't wanna be dead.

01:32.576 --> 01:34.593
NANCY GILLIAN:
I feel like I might not be dead,

01:34.670 --> 01:35.819
but just more maimed.

01:35.821 --> 01:36.987
Nope, dead.

01:37.005 --> 01:38.305
-Man, that's a cheat.
-Yeah, seriously.

01:38.456 --> 01:39.932
That Jack kid told us
his sisters were in there.

01:40.008 --> 01:40.933
You were also told

01:41.327 --> 01:43.084
there might be a secondary
explosive device.

01:43.162 --> 01:45.253
That's BS. Cap radioed in
and asked about the other bomb

01:45.272 --> 01:46.588
and nobody answered.

01:46.849 --> 01:49.090
Now, comm failure
is a real issue
in these situations.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.792
That's why they put it
in the drill.

01:50.794 --> 01:52.185
The no-win scenario.

01:52.338 --> 01:54.762
Yeah, she totally
Kobayashi Maru-ed our asses.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.598
Take this to the IC downstairs

01:56.617 --> 02:00.160
and let them know
that the 126 is out
for the rest of the drill.

02:04.516 --> 02:07.417
For real though, somebody needs
to get this Jack kid an agent.

02:08.462 --> 02:11.463

02:33.896 --> 02:35.470
NANCY: TK, come over here.

02:35.547 --> 02:38.215
We're gonna send
a selfie to Marjan.

02:38.233 --> 02:40.975
-MATEO: Love it, come on.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
Talk about pretty in pink.

02:40.995 --> 02:43.720
Okay, everybody say "dead sexy."

02:43.722 --> 02:45.330
ALL: Dead sexy.

02:45.482 --> 02:46.814
(laughter)

02:46.834 --> 02:48.458
You guys think this is a joke?

02:50.171 --> 02:51.503
You think if this had been
the real thing,

02:51.655 --> 02:53.505
you'd be back here laughing
and taking selfies?

02:53.657 --> 02:55.007
You'd be in a body bag.

02:55.158 --> 02:57.176
If they could find
anything of you to put in it.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.160
I suggest you hit the showers

02:59.496 --> 03:01.571
and take a moment to think
about the first responders

03:01.573 --> 03:04.349
who went on calls like this
and never came back.

03:05.761 --> 03:07.352
Show some respect.

03:18.106 --> 03:19.347
(knock on door)

03:19.425 --> 03:21.200
JUDD RYDER: Cap, you got a sec?

03:21.427 --> 03:24.203
Not if you're gonna
tell me I overreacted.

03:24.354 --> 03:26.947
No, I ain't gonna
tell you that for a minute.

03:27.099 --> 03:28.690
I happen to know
what it's like to go to

03:28.692 --> 03:29.933
more than one funeral in a week

03:29.952 --> 03:31.585
or even one day for that matter.

03:33.105 --> 03:34.546
They ain't been through
what we've been through.

03:34.623 --> 03:36.048
Yeah, well, they might.

03:36.533 --> 03:37.507
And soon.

03:39.294 --> 03:41.887
Look, those drills
are designed for us to fail.

03:42.038 --> 03:43.555
If it was a different team,

03:43.632 --> 03:45.632
same scenario,
it's the same result.

03:45.709 --> 03:47.226
Yeah, I'm not
talking about the drills.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.530
Something's coming, Judd.

04:01.742 --> 04:02.890
Something big.

04:02.968 --> 04:04.243
What are you talkin' about?

04:04.319 --> 04:05.911
And I don't think
it's any coincidence

04:06.062 --> 04:07.637
that they sprung that drill
on us this week.

04:07.639 --> 04:08.413
It wasn't on the calendar.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.414
You know they like to do that.

04:09.566 --> 04:10.749
That's how they
keep us on our toes.

04:10.900 --> 04:12.900
No, no, no. It's more than that.

04:12.978 --> 04:14.995
Why do I get the feeling
that this isn't just

04:15.071 --> 04:17.589
the-the hair standing up
on the back of your neck?

04:17.666 --> 04:19.165
(sighs)

04:19.318 --> 04:21.318
Because it's not.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.578
You remember the biker gang,
the Honor Dogs?

04:23.655 --> 04:24.488
Yeah.

04:24.490 --> 04:25.989
Turns out they're on the FBI's

04:26.008 --> 04:28.141
domestic terror watch list.

04:28.994 --> 04:31.103
-Them guys?
-Yeah.

04:31.254 --> 04:33.921
And a truckload of
ammonium nitrate was stolen

04:33.999 --> 04:35.181
near Laredo three weeks ago.

04:35.334 --> 04:37.925
And the feds are convinced
the Honor Dogs have it

04:37.945 --> 04:39.019
and are planning something.

04:39.171 --> 04:40.854
How do you know all that?

04:40.930 --> 04:42.430
'Cause I've been
working with them.

04:42.449 --> 04:43.949
The feds?

04:44.100 --> 04:47.786
So after you and I went to
the, uh, branding that night,

04:47.937 --> 04:49.696
I got a knock on my door.
It was the FBI.

04:49.773 --> 04:51.181
They wanted me to go back.

04:51.199 --> 04:52.516
JUDD: Damn.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.201
Well, hell, Owen, I-- what-what
do these idiots wanna do?

04:55.278 --> 04:57.629
I don't know.
I never got close enough.

04:57.781 --> 04:58.855
What do the feds think?

04:58.948 --> 05:00.448
I don't know.
They've frozen me out.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.301
They won't even
return my phone calls.

05:05.047 --> 05:08.289
Do you know why
so many of us died on 9/11?

05:08.367 --> 05:10.458
'Cause we didn't know
what we were walking into.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.568
Suppose you did?

05:11.570 --> 05:12.627
Well, we still
would have gone in,

05:12.646 --> 05:14.271
but our odds sure
would have been better.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.356
No, I'm not gonna do it.

05:18.894 --> 05:19.967
I'm not just gonna sit here

05:20.045 --> 05:22.562
and wait
for the tones to go off.

05:22.639 --> 05:24.972
Judd, you're acting captain
till I get back.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.809
Wh-wh-what do I tell people
if they ask where you are?

05:27.886 --> 05:30.495
Tell 'em I'm out there
not taking no for an answer.

05:45.904 --> 05:48.680
BIKER 1: The feds think
they can play games with us?

05:48.832 --> 05:49.831
We'll see about that.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.091
BIKER 2:
They pushed us too far, Red.

05:51.167 --> 05:53.852
Enough's enough.
Time we pushed back.

05:53.929 --> 05:54.853
-BIKER 3: Yeah!
-BIKER 4: That's right.

05:54.930 --> 05:56.188
RED:
You need to relax, Turner.

05:56.264 --> 05:58.081
They're just trying
to get in our heads.

05:58.100 --> 06:00.275
Looks like I might be
interrupting something.

06:03.530 --> 06:07.273
You got a lot of brass, Strand,
coming back in here.

06:07.350 --> 06:08.992
OWEN:
You and I need to talk.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.119
Alone.

06:12.097 --> 06:13.780
You wearing a wire again?

06:13.932 --> 06:16.449
No, you can...
you can check my junk.

06:16.602 --> 06:17.542
I'll pass.

06:17.694 --> 06:18.710
And we don't talk to the feds

06:18.937 --> 06:20.770
or friends of the feds.

06:20.772 --> 06:21.863
I'm just here as a fire captain.

06:21.940 --> 06:24.124
-All I need is a word.
-Tough.

06:24.276 --> 06:26.109
This bar's closed to you
from here on out.

06:26.111 --> 06:28.703
You understand?
So walk out before
you get dragged out.

06:28.722 --> 06:29.888
BIKER: Yeah!

06:30.115 --> 06:31.205
Well this bar is gonna be
closed to everybody

06:31.283 --> 06:32.224
unless you talk to me.

06:32.375 --> 06:33.541
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

06:33.635 --> 06:36.043
Just that I'm seeing
a lot of code violations.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.880
Blocked egress over there,
that's a fire hazard.

06:38.957 --> 06:40.306
No occupancy load signs.

06:40.459 --> 06:42.216
Ceiling isn't up to code,
that's a big one.

06:42.236 --> 06:43.977
I'm gonna have to write you up
for that one for sure.

06:44.129 --> 06:46.129
I'm saying I will shut you down

06:46.131 --> 06:48.156
quicker than you can say,
"Don't tread on me."

06:50.469 --> 06:51.284
Fine.

06:52.137 --> 06:53.453
What the hell do you want?

06:56.308 --> 06:59.292
Oh, well, we can
do it like this then.

07:01.647 --> 07:03.422
I know about the ANFO.

07:03.573 --> 07:04.664
And so do the feds.

07:04.816 --> 07:06.925
You give up everything you have,

07:07.002 --> 07:09.302
maybe you could still
make some sort of a deal.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.821
ANFO?

07:11.823 --> 07:15.934
Look, you once told me that
you revered first responders.

07:16.161 --> 07:17.160
I'm inclined to believe you.

07:17.496 --> 07:20.254
Whatever message you think
you're gonna be making

07:20.332 --> 07:22.165
with the explosives
that you hijacked,

07:22.184 --> 07:24.334
you're just gonna be
hurting good people.

07:24.352 --> 07:26.486
BIKER:
What's he talking about?

07:31.693 --> 07:32.951
Very moving speech, Strand.

07:33.102 --> 07:35.454
But I got no idea
what you're talking about.

Yeah, you thinking it's okay
to share details

07:57.126 --> 07:59.126

07:59.204 --> 08:02.797
Agent Biondi, please escort
Captain Strand outside

08:14.219 --> 08:15.235
No.

08:15.570 --> 08:16.995
I didn't think you guys
had enough for a warrant.

08:17.146 --> 08:18.555
Well, a judge thought we did.

08:18.557 --> 08:21.074
-So you found the ANFO?
-We will.

08:21.226 --> 08:22.667
One of 'em will flip.
That's how the game is played.

08:22.819 --> 08:25.152
Look, Agent Chuck, I think
you guys are rushing this.

08:25.230 --> 08:26.821
I don't think any of these guys
are gonna flip.

08:26.898 --> 08:29.065
Because I don't think actually
any of 'em know anything.

08:29.067 --> 08:31.760
Then why are they acting
so suspicious and paranoid?

08:32.404 --> 08:33.345
Really?

Hands behind your back.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.708
that there was
an FBI raid underway
when the bomb went off.

09:03.785 --> 09:05.769
So we're looking at about
a dozen agents inside

09:05.771 --> 09:07.045
and God knows how many bikers.

09:07.196 --> 09:09.196
Hey, did dispatch say anything
about where Cap is?

09:09.216 --> 09:10.423
Cap? No. Why would they?

09:12.553 --> 09:14.052
-Judd, what the hell?
-JUDD: Not right now.

09:14.203 --> 09:16.221
Hey, Gallagher,
get that mainline off.

09:16.372 --> 09:18.372
Strickland you and Chavez
take a team inside,

09:18.392 --> 09:19.707
extract all the wounded.

09:19.951 --> 09:22.043
Everybody else, get pressure
in those two-and-a-halves

09:22.062 --> 09:23.562

those windows.

09:23.638 --> 09:25.546

09:34.724 --> 09:36.816
About how many agents do
you say you got inside still?

09:36.968 --> 09:38.225
-Seven.
-JUDD: Seven?
