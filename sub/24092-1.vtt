01:48.470 --> 01:50.250
How am I here?!

02:04.300 --> 02:07.550
What's going on here?!

02:19.400 --> 02:20.936
Crap!

02:20.960 --> 02:22.770
I have no strength!

02:25.950 --> 02:27.100
There is it!

02:50.730 --> 02:52.910
You dirt bird!

03:07.800 --> 03:11.930
Do you ever know who you're up against?

03:13.700 --> 03:14.880
I am...

03:15.930 --> 03:17.700
a wizard of...

03:17.960 --> 03:20.060
Fairy Tail!

03:50.120 --> 03:51.136
Who are you?!

03:51.160 --> 03:54.030
This is temple under the protection
of the Kingdom of Fiore!

03:54.480 --> 03:56.200
Don't get any closer!

03:56.220 --> 03:57.750
Do not you hear me?!

03:58.160 --> 04:01.500
It can not be that, a small fish like her

04:01.520 --> 04:04.640
can protect the greatest
mystery of the empire.

04:09.740 --> 04:13.690
As expected... The pride of Fiore,
the special unit of the "White Tiger".

04:14.560 --> 04:15.390
And?

04:15.570 --> 04:18.790
Who is the strongest of you?

04:25.700 --> 04:27.430
Do you?

04:27.770 --> 04:30.930
You? You are not truly Zash which
has betrayed Fiore?

04:31.180 --> 04:32.720
The ancient story.

04:33.180 --> 04:34.820
I have long forgotten.

04:35.330 --> 04:38.570
Although, such fine soldiers...

04:39.120 --> 04:41.770
Are stationed in such a remote area,

04:41.790 --> 04:43.550
Is really bad luck.

04:45.230 --> 04:48.340
But an even greater misfortune.

04:54.660 --> 04:59.100
Is that I face you?!

05:09.670 --> 05:11.380
Commander, what are you doing?

05:28.620 --> 05:31.760
Why... are we fighting so... needlessly!

05:56.730 --> 05:58.600
If you could control people,

05:58.760 --> 06:01.440
So you don't have to let them suffer...

06:01.640 --> 06:03.490
I hate you.

06:03.760 --> 06:07.290
People who are with each other.
"Comrades" or what they call them.

06:13.950 --> 06:18.190
Lady Sonia, could you determine
the position of the staff for me?

06:20.190 --> 06:24.410
Lord Zash, could you hear
the wailing of souls?

06:24.860 --> 06:28.360
I have nothing of that.

06:42.870 --> 06:45.586
Natsu!

06:45.610 --> 06:48.380
Help!

06:51.180 --> 06:53.180
A dog, Natsu!

06:53.420 --> 06:55.380
He's looking here!

07:11.540 --> 07:13.440
Thank you, Natsu!

07:13.460 --> 07:15.820
There was nothing there!

07:18.830 --> 07:22.360
I don't think so! How could you be
so annoyed by this sweet doggy?!

07:22.380 --> 07:24.080
How did he not annoy him?

07:24.100 --> 07:25.860
I just stared at him.

07:27.580 --> 07:29.780
Happy, you do not like dogs?

07:30.190 --> 07:32.550
Plue is also a dog.

07:34.760 --> 07:37.516
But look, he does not look like a dog.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.350
What is he actually? An insect?

07:41.610 --> 07:44.530
If he were a fish, he would leak...
cute, right?

07:44.850 --> 07:46.420
Plue is a Celestial Spirit!

07:46.700 --> 07:49.650
Besides, you look like a dog.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.650
Are your eyes okay?

07:55.780 --> 07:57.540
W... What is it?

07:59.770 --> 08:02.230
You are pretty close...

08:02.540 --> 08:04.580
How do I look?

08:05.510 --> 08:07.450
You look like Natsu. It is obvious...

08:09.890 --> 08:12.460
Natsu! Lucy...!

08:13.700 --> 08:15.980
Am I still looking straight?!

08:16.000 --> 08:17.840
No! Don't get idea's Wendy!

08:17.940 --> 08:21.766
Gray! There was an extremely
terrifying dog just now!

08:21.790 --> 08:22.250
Oh, yeah?

08:23.610 --> 08:25.920
Ice-Make.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.130
Wagon-Wheel.

08:30.130 --> 08:32.460
It will hold up to the royal capital.

08:32.760 --> 08:33.919
That will be enough.

08:34.360 --> 08:37.140
You are truly a great wizard, Gray.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.960
We haven't been in the
capital for a long time.

08:44.350 --> 08:45.060
Yeah...

08:47.160 --> 08:50.010
Boring!

08:50.990 --> 08:53.340
Learn so what if it's boring.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.036
In our present time, knowledge is power.

08:56.060 --> 08:58.610
How? Gajeel, you're learning?!

08:58.980 --> 09:01.500
What are you talking about?
You're reading a cat dictionary!

09:01.520 --> 09:03.950
This is also a very important study!

09:06.610 --> 09:08.440
What is my beloved Gray doing...

09:09.500 --> 09:10.406
Here...

09:10.430 --> 09:11.550
Aah!
Aah!

09:11.570 --> 09:13.340
That tastes really good, Lucy!

09:14.170 --> 09:16.200
Can you scrub my back, please?

09:16.220 --> 09:18.190
And also the front?

09:19.150 --> 09:21.540
Please sing me a lullaby.

09:21.640 --> 09:22.770
You spoilt child, you...

09:23.870 --> 09:25.130
Do not make such a noise!

09:26.340 --> 09:27.410
Hey, Gajeel!

09:27.620 --> 09:28.140
Hee?

09:28.760 --> 09:30.230
Do you want to order something?

09:30.610 --> 09:33.340
It is a little far but the fee is good.

09:33.360 --> 09:35.610
That's a man! I'm in!

09:35.630 --> 09:37.436
We're clearing up the loft today.

09:37.460 --> 09:39.066
Bring me something!

09:39.090 --> 09:40.680
Juvia is coming!

09:41.310 --> 09:45.920
So I can make my beloved Gray
jealous for my heart.

09:46.840 --> 09:52.080
Gajeel, your hard and cold
chest is just wonderful...

09:52.290 --> 09:54.250
Well, it is made of iron...

09:55.140 --> 09:58.176
Lily! You are as good as a stuffed animal.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.720
Let go, or you burn your fingers.

10:01.740 --> 10:05.556
Levy, you are so small and cute...

10:05.580 --> 10:07.940
This is not possible, Juvia, anyway.

10:10.680 --> 10:12.820
Impossible...

10:19.140 --> 10:20.860
The grave of dragons.

10:21.410 --> 10:25.270
I believe, that some have already
seen it at the Great Magic Games,

10:25.570 --> 10:26.540
but below the Arena...

10:26.560 --> 10:29.870
Is place where ancient
dragonbones are resting.

10:30.750 --> 10:32.310
It is the last resting place.

10:32.740 --> 10:35.050
The dragon, which once stood against.

10:35.190 --> 10:38.620
The black dragon Acnologia,
fought and defeated it.

10:39.240 --> 10:42.486
My ancestors have examined the
retirement several times.

10:42.510 --> 10:46.060
In the end, they built the arena to
commemorate the dragons.

10:47.020 --> 10:52.410
About 100 years ago, a staff was
found in the tomb of the dragons.

10:52.530 --> 10:53.350
A Staff?

10:53.760 --> 10:56.640
Was it the walking stick of a dragon?

10:56.920 --> 10:59.470
No, it is a subject of men.

11:00.270 --> 11:04.860
This staff absorbed the anger
and grief of the dragons.

11:04.880 --> 11:06.916
And by the accumulated power

11:06.940 --> 11:09.890
deformed its original shape.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.690
The name of this staff is...

11:12.710 --> 11:14.250
Dragon Cry!

11:14.640 --> 11:18.550
This staff has the power
obliterate an entire empire.

11:19.340 --> 11:24.246
A few days ago, this staff was replaced
by Fiores former Foreign Minister.

11:24.270 --> 11:26.510
Zash Caine stolen,

11:27.030 --> 11:30.130
Zash is follower of Black Magic.

11:30.300 --> 11:33.596
In secret he planned to overthrow
the royal family, but he failed.

11:33.620 --> 11:35.376
Before the military could arrest him.

11:35.400 --> 11:39.160
He fled abroad with the
help of his comrades.

11:39.710 --> 11:45.890
But when the exile in the kingdom
of Stella was preserved, he died.

11:47.280 --> 11:51.300
All his subordinates, as a gift
for the Kingdom of Stella.

11:52.470 --> 11:55.050
He killed his comrades?

11:55.160 --> 12:01.710
After his emigration he has climbed up to Stella's state
minister by his spying ability and a brutal ways.

12:02.140 --> 12:03.660
A terrible man!

12:04.940 --> 12:09.500
This dangerous man takes possession
of a dangerous object.

12:10.040 --> 12:13.300
Please get the staff back before
doing something bad with it.

12:13.530 --> 12:14.370
Definitely!

12:14.890 --> 12:17.470
Tell me, where is the Kingdom Stella?

12:17.840 --> 12:20.180
It is located in the southeast Ishgars.

12:20.330 --> 12:22.246
Surrounded by a steep cliff wall,

12:22.270 --> 12:25.326
It is an island isolated by the
foreign countries completely.

12:25.350 --> 12:26.816
An island?!

12:26.840 --> 12:28.860
Does that mean we're going by boat?

12:48.830 --> 12:52.760
A support of Stella is mineral
which is harder than diamond.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.610
The Stellanium.

12:55.240 --> 12:59.610
It means that it absorbs the sparkle of
the stars and radiates brighter.

13:01.270 --> 13:02.970
How romantic!

13:03.920 --> 13:08.010
The most beautiful part
of the continent is this.

13:08.260 --> 13:10.670
The sea should also be very beautiful!

13:11.210 --> 13:14.380
There should be plenty of good food.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.920
Are we still not there?

13:28.470 --> 13:30.970
Why do I have to do this?

13:31.640 --> 13:33.030
Do not complain.

13:33.350 --> 13:34.820
It suits you.

13:36.070 --> 13:38.770
Zash allegedly preserves
the various duety's.

13:38.790 --> 13:40.880
In a tower in the castle.

13:41.430 --> 13:44.110
The key to this camp is his ring.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.820
No matter how evil he may be, he is the
minister of a country.

13:48.250 --> 13:49.810
If we take it by force,

13:49.830 --> 13:51.630
there is an international conflict.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.739
So we're going to give him the ring.

13:54.740 --> 13:56.600
In this bar, which he often visits!

13:57.020 --> 13:58.440
Without being noticed!

13:58.930 --> 14:01.500
Lucy, draw attention to you.

14:01.600 --> 14:02.700
Roger that.

14:03.160 --> 14:04.880
We begin our operation.

14:34.810 --> 14:35.710
Gemini.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.120
Make a copy of it.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.660
One second is enough.

15:20.040 --> 15:21.240
I bring him back.

15:24.610 --> 15:26.400
Happy, Charles.

15:26.780 --> 15:29.736
We will bring him to Natsu and Wendy.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.330
Leave it to us!

15:31.580 --> 15:33.130
Let's go!

15:33.520 --> 15:34.510
I'm counting on you!

15:41.010 --> 15:42.550
What's the matter, Lilly?

15:42.690 --> 15:45.930
It felt like Carla and Happy were here.

15:46.050 --> 15:47.980
Is it such a remote island?

15:53.480 --> 15:55.600
Natsu, what are you doing?

15:58.770 --> 16:02.530
How did you recognize me?
Wendy is also quite obvious.

16:04.850 --> 16:07.680
I told you we would get caught, Natsu.

16:08.430 --> 16:12.100
Let's go once!
Let's hide before we find!

16:15.570 --> 16:16.976
There are two guards.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.330
Leave it to me!

16:20.800 --> 16:22.740
Hurry up!
Sorry!

16:27.510 --> 16:28.580
It's Okay - clear!

16:30.010 --> 16:31.266
Quick, look!

16:31.290 --> 16:31.910
Well.

16:38.020 --> 16:38.770
Natsu!

16:39.130 --> 16:41.520
From this direction I feel
a huge magical force.

17:20.260 --> 17:21.260
So this is...

17:23.020 --> 17:24.329
Dragon Cry.

17:45.810 --> 17:47.200
N... Natsu?

17:50.460 --> 17:51.470
What's this?!

17:52.020 --> 17:52.910
A Trap?

17:53.020 --> 17:55.640
A magic circle that activates
when the wand is removed!

17:55.870 --> 17:57.540
Mist! Let's go!

17:57.660 --> 17:58.300
Yes!

18:00.770 --> 18:01.900
Enemies spotted!

18:02.600 --> 18:04.870
The thieves have invaded the treasury!

18:05.260 --> 18:07.130
Into fighting, kill all of them!

18:07.530 --> 18:09.790
Use magic-powered guns.

18:10.890 --> 18:11.890
Fire!!

18:13.700 --> 18:16.760
Next, the rifles up! Fire!

18:18.830 --> 18:20.580
We can not stay in the air!
Onto the ground!

18:21.840 --> 18:24.160
Ahm... Dear Guest...

18:24.300 --> 18:26.246
But you are a pretty thing.

18:26.270 --> 18:28.476
Th-... They embarrass me...

18:28.500 --> 18:29.870
Why is that?

18:31.460 --> 18:34.050
I will make you my wife!

18:34.450 --> 18:35.100
Na?

18:36.130 --> 18:37.210
Dear Customer,

18:38.610 --> 18:42.400
could you please refrain from harassing
the dancers this bar?

18:44.400 --> 18:46.330
Lord Zash, the Staff!

18:47.180 --> 18:48.960
The Staff has been stolen!

18:52.150 --> 18:55.250
Natsu, this idiot, has been
exposed far too early!

18:58.120 --> 18:59.810
Who are you?

19:05.400 --> 19:07.810
Smoking is prohibited in the bar.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.020
This way. We're leaving.

19:15.230 --> 19:16.090
Erza!

19:25.960 --> 19:27.730
Men from Fiore?

19:28.050 --> 19:29.020
Stop!!

19:29.620 --> 19:32.280
The nerves! I blow them all away!

19:32.490 --> 19:35.990
You can not! The soldiers have
not have done anything evil!

19:37.840 --> 19:38.640
Wendy!

19:39.720 --> 19:41.900
All who hurt my comrades,

19:42.670 --> 19:44.050
Are my enemies!

19:45.790 --> 19:47.660
Wendy, take care of the staff!

19:47.830 --> 19:48.390
Yeah!

19:53.870 --> 19:55.796
Wendy, is you're injury Okay?

19:55.820 --> 19:57.480
No, it's nothing.

19:57.990 --> 19:59.526
Much important is the Staff.

19:59.550 --> 20:00.140
Above!

20:02.640 --> 20:03.350
The Staff!

20:03.460 --> 20:04.300
Happy!

20:20.030 --> 20:21.410
Wendy, here!

20:21.740 --> 20:22.640
Catch!

20:36.330 --> 20:37.190
Gray!

20:37.190 --> 20:37.990
Yeah!

20:43.790 --> 20:44.790
Sorry guys!

21:05.550 --> 21:06.440
Lucy!

21:11.220 --> 21:13.670
Open, gate of the Scorpion!

21:14.210 --> 21:15.210
Scorpio!

21:17.020 --> 21:18.630
Sand Buster!

21:21.690 --> 21:22.440
Very good!

21:26.580 --> 21:27.290
Lucy!

21:27.950 --> 21:28.950
Be careful!

21:30.280 --> 21:31.100
Scorpio...

21:34.330 --> 21:36.580
How did you enter the treasury?

21:39.960 --> 21:44.300
The door should not be
opened without my ring.

21:46.310 --> 21:49.480
Give up, I've won.

21:50.460 --> 21:55.030
Do you know why I was charged with
the protection of this empire?

21:57.610 --> 22:02.480
I am the strongest man of this kingdom!

22:05.410 --> 22:06.140
Natsu!

22:19.680 --> 22:20.750
Natsu!

22:30.700 --> 22:32.040
What's up with them?

22:32.410 --> 22:33.606
I'm going all at once!

22:33.630 --> 22:37.000
Stop! These people are normal citizens
and are forced to be soldiers!

22:37.360 --> 22:38.030
How?

22:38.490 --> 22:39.616
They are being controlled!

22:39.640 --> 22:40.770
Dirty trick!

22:41.140 --> 22:43.290
Be a good boy, and give me the Staff!

22:43.510 --> 22:45.110
It does not belong to you!

22:45.370 --> 22:49.440
Fiore has no idea of its true power!

22:53.660 --> 22:54.340
Hold on!

22:54.570 --> 22:55.619
See you later!

22:55.620 --> 22:56.270
What?

23:09.350 --> 23:14.340
What a bad luck that you have me
as an enemy.

23:17.380 --> 23:20.590
Zash, what an extraordinary disgrace.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.700
No worries, Majesty,

23:23.220 --> 23:26.280
With the power of Lady Sonya
we find their position...

23:28.600 --> 23:30.590
Sonya is mine.

23:31.130 --> 23:35.770
Because of such incompetent person like
you, I will not expose them to danger.

23:39.610 --> 23:42.670
But we do not have much time.

23:43.580 --> 23:46.500
We must use Sonya's power.

23:47.740 --> 23:49.940
The Three Stars will go with you!

23:50.370 --> 23:51.010
I won!

23:51.260 --> 23:54.270
Listen! When we make use of Sonya's power,

23:54.610 --> 23:56.540
She needs the perfect.

23:57.580 --> 24:00.480
Sonya shall in no way be harmed.

24:08.910 --> 24:09.910
Sonya.

24:10.810 --> 24:12.170
King Animus...

24:12.500 --> 24:15.650
You are already back without
making a sound in my room...

24:16.840 --> 24:18.560
I'm just a mage.

24:21.110 --> 24:23.460
This empire running out of time.

24:28.110 --> 24:31.150
I must get Dragon Cry into
my possession at all costs.

24:38.170 --> 24:39.840
We captured the Staff.

24:40.650 --> 24:44.120
But the question is how we
bring it back to Fiore.

24:44.610 --> 24:48.210
That they discovered us is Natsu's fault.

24:48.360 --> 24:51.910
That was not my fault! There was a trap!

24:52.360 --> 24:54.510
I did not notice them.

24:54.830 --> 24:55.660
I'm so sorry.

24:56.130 --> 24:57.130
In any case...

24:57.600 --> 25:00.766
This Staff seems to carry an
incredible amount of power.

25:00.790 --> 25:02.490
Show me, show me!

25:04.400 --> 25:07.010
I do not feel magic at all.

25:07.290 --> 25:08.600
Stop playing around with it!

25:10.170 --> 25:11.990
But before that, Natsu...

25:12.660 --> 25:14.690
What? Yeah...

25:18.380 --> 25:21.210
I do not understand?!

25:21.930 --> 25:26.070
In all cases, a Staff that can
destroy a kingdom is dangerous.

25:26.470 --> 25:28.400
We have to handle it cautiously.

25:32.770 --> 25:36.320
You girls came from outside?

25:36.920 --> 25:37.960
Yes...

25:38.600 --> 25:40.850
The guy there too?

25:43.210 --> 25:45.426
Baby, oh Baby!

25:45.450 --> 25:47.020
Dear guest, please stop!

25:49.450 --> 25:50.950
What is the matter, Juvia?

25:54.130 --> 25:58.620
So my Gray-Sensor is still
striking in this city.

26:00.850 --> 26:03.010
What's going on, Gray?

26:03.190 --> 26:05.710
Nothing, just a shiver ran down my spine.

26:05.880 --> 26:07.770
And you're scolding ice-cream?

26:09.260 --> 26:10.800
You're not wearing any clothes!

26:11.620 --> 26:12.620
Since when?!

26:12.790 --> 26:15.690
Compared to Fiore, we are
here higher above sea level.

26:16.180 --> 26:17.710
This makes the Temperature cooler here.

26:19.330 --> 26:21.369
By the way, the air is delicious!

26:21.370 --> 26:23.530
Sorry. I just popped.

26:24.760 --> 26:29.840
Since you can see the stars so well, the Kingdom
of Stella is also called the "Land of the Stars".

26:34.090 --> 26:34.970
Liar.

26:35.220 --> 26:37.670
If it is cloudy, you can not do anything.

26:38.180 --> 26:43.360
As a Stellarmagier, I always wanted to see
Stella's sparkling stars.

26:45.830 --> 26:46.866
Quiet!

26:46.890 --> 26:48.036
Someone's coming.

26:48.060 --> 26:48.990
Followers?

26:49.440 --> 26:50.800
How did they find us here?

26:51.260 --> 26:53.040
Get ready!

26:55.660 --> 26:56.296
From above?!

26:56.320 --> 26:59.130
Taste my beautiful legs!

27:04.090 --> 27:06.170
Here, my wonderful Kick!

27:08.260 --> 27:09.570
Stellanium?!

27:12.700 --> 27:15.930
Get to work. Francis, Catherine!

27:18.970 --> 27:19.570
Hot!

27:20.020 --> 27:22.640
All right, Francios, Catherine!

27:24.800 --> 27:26.150
What are these guys?!

27:34.380 --> 27:35.350
Too slow!

27:39.680 --> 27:41.390
Fast! Fast!

27:43.220 --> 27:44.600
Francis, well done!

27:47.480 --> 27:49.480
Catherine, you're also wonderful.

27:52.610 --> 27:54.190
And how do you like my pretty legs?

27:58.980 --> 28:00.410
I have the Staff again.

28:02.760 --> 28:03.920
Bastard!

28:19.940 --> 28:22.070
Wait a moment Natsu whats going on?

28:22.970 --> 28:23.740
Natsu?!

28:27.180 --> 28:28.730
What's the matter, Natsu?

28:42.100 --> 28:43.990
You are really slow.

29:03.870 --> 29:05.830
Excellent job, Three Stars!

29:06.440 --> 29:07.690
Eliminate them.

29:07.710 --> 29:09.660
H.. hold on.

29:09.860 --> 29:11.820
We already have the Staff.

29:12.150 --> 29:13.300
Killing them would be...

29:13.550 --> 29:18.400
But Lady Sonya, they are
rebelling against our empire.

29:18.610 --> 29:22.380
If we do not punish them, we do not
give our people a good example.

29:23.510 --> 29:27.910
I do not want to lull the
lamentation of the souls...

29:30.270 --> 29:34.360
Hurt her Lady Sonya's feelings, his majesty
will not furiously at you.

29:34.580 --> 29:35.840
That's true.

29:36.050 --> 29:39.680
Francis, Catherine,
you're work is finished.

29:41.880 --> 29:44.270
Then they will be locked the Bird's Nest!

29:44.410 --> 29:45.180
Yes, Sir!

29:51.790 --> 29:54.060
Except this woman. She belongs to me.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.360
I remember now...

30:17.950 --> 30:19.140
Its all my fault!

30:20.080 --> 30:21.720
I have to save the others!

30:22.160 --> 30:24.440
Crap! I'm so sorry!

30:29.880 --> 30:31.150
Lucy is not here!

30:31.490 --> 30:32.800
Not here either!

30:32.940 --> 30:35.150
Why isn't Lucy here?

30:35.710 --> 30:36.770
Such...

30:37.220 --> 30:37.670
Lucy...

30:39.360 --> 30:40.070
Natsu

30:40.170 --> 30:42.890
I know. We will definitely find her.

30:43.570 --> 30:45.780
Wait for us, Lucy!

30:53.220 --> 30:54.220
Sonya,

30:55.530 --> 30:56.780
King Animus!

30:57.290 --> 30:58.690
What about the Staff?

30:59.300 --> 31:00.410
Lord Zash,

31:00.910 --> 31:03.950
takes over until tomorrow ritual
responsibility and secures it.

31:04.130 --> 31:06.780
Why does he not bring it to me?!

31:07.860 --> 31:08.860
Majesty.

31:09.850 --> 31:15.550
We do not have time anymore.
Bring me Dragon Cry.

31:34.810 --> 31:36.610
Where am I?

31:39.370 --> 31:40.240
People?

31:40.870 --> 31:42.050
Poor thing.

31:42.380 --> 31:43.580
A new one...

31:48.600 --> 31:52.670
Welcome to hell on earth...

31:53.480 --> 31:55.880
W... What are those injuries?

32:07.940 --> 32:10.080
You? What is the meaning of this?

32:16.870 --> 32:18.090
Come with me.

32:19.230 --> 32:19.990
Yes, Sir.

32:26.310 --> 32:27.580
Stand there.

32:28.150 --> 32:28.920
Okay.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.350
Lift your arms.

32:32.760 --> 32:33.540
Okay.

32:38.020 --> 32:41.860
You know what is going to
happen to you right now?

32:45.170 --> 32:46.820
I will take blood every day.

32:46.950 --> 32:50.330
There will remain scars, but no fear.
I will not kill you.

32:50.980 --> 32:55.020
For my Black Magic I need
a lot of pure blood.

32:56.080 --> 32:58.380
Delight me with your cries.

33:01.530 --> 33:02.760
Y... Yes...

33:15.850 --> 33:16.980
Lord Zash!

33:17.780 --> 33:19.790
Give us Lucy back!

33:20.120 --> 33:20.890
Natsu!

33:22.420 --> 33:24.600
A... A Dragon Slayer?

33:30.560 --> 33:31.620
Are you all right?

33:32.770 --> 33:33.530
Yeah!

33:35.270 --> 33:36.706
Natsu, hurry up!

33:36.730 --> 33:38.630
It has become even more soldiers!

33:38.740 --> 33:40.620
We probably exaggerated.

33:41.570 --> 33:44.660
You escaped from the Bird's Nest?!

33:44.920 --> 33:46.560
How did you get here?

33:46.580 --> 33:48.080
I have a nose.

33:48.680 --> 33:51.030
The smell of my comrades is special!

33:51.410 --> 33:53.280
Stop it, Natsu!

33:55.420 --> 33:57.250
You bastard!

33:59.860 --> 34:02.060
Lord Zash, please stop! The...

34:02.460 --> 34:06.360
All those who oppose me shall be gone.

34:06.580 --> 34:08.560
I speak a protection magic!

34:14.179 --> 34:15.699
Is everyone okay?

34:15.699 --> 34:16.620
Yeah.

34:16.730 --> 34:17.860
Somehow...

34:18.050 --> 34:20.570
Thank you for hurrying to my aid.

34:20.750 --> 34:23.299
In fact, this is Natsu's fault.

34:23.300 --> 34:24.300
How...?!

34:24.449 --> 34:26.060
Who's that?

34:28.730 --> 34:30.045
Now that you mention it!

34:30.070 --> 34:31.070
Who are you?

34:31.719 --> 34:33.196
I... I'm...

34:33.219 --> 34:35.540
Where are you, you miserable thieves?!

34:38.659 --> 34:41.130
Here there is a secret
passage come with me.

34:41.260 --> 34:43.000
We must recover the Staff!

34:43.230 --> 34:44.780
We should withdraw for now.

34:45.040 --> 34:48.969
If we can not find a weak spot
in his magic, we can not win!

35:00.610 --> 35:01.550
This way.

35:03.080 --> 35:05.160
Do you know where others are?

35:05.410 --> 35:07.500
This is my magic.

35:07.670 --> 35:10.570
So that's why our whereabouts are unknown.

35:17.310 --> 35:19.430
From here you should be safe.

35:19.600 --> 35:20.906
Thank you.

35:20.930 --> 35:22.740
Who are you?

35:23.140 --> 35:26.610
I'm Sonya, a confidant of King Animus.

35:27.390 --> 35:30.260
And why do you let us escape?

35:32.000 --> 35:33.910
There must be a reason for this.

35:36.010 --> 35:40.840
I do not want people to run
into misery any longer.

35:45.080 --> 35:49.480
I have been friends with King
Animus since my childhood.

35:50.410 --> 35:52.340
He used to be kind-hearted.

35:53.100 --> 35:57.050
But since Lord Zash brought him Dragon Cry.

35:57.930 --> 36:00.300
He is possessed by your Staff.

36:01.740 --> 36:06.100
I have also participated in
the robbery of the kingdom.

36:06.710 --> 36:08.120
For correcting?

36:09.600 --> 36:11.670
Do you know what Stellarium is?

36:12.150 --> 36:14.320
A mineral from this area, right?

36:15.510 --> 36:22.630
The more starlight Stellarium absorbs the
brighter it radiates and becomes a precious gem.

36:23.920 --> 36:28.480
However, the Stellarium has been
crying out for several years now.

36:28.600 --> 36:29.420
How?!

36:29.700 --> 36:37.370
It is probable that the Stellarium, absorbing too much
starlight, then the amount is sometimes unstable.

36:38.250 --> 36:40.580
What does this mean?

36:41.090 --> 36:46.250
Stellarium which has absorbed a certain
set of starlight has magical strength.

36:47.310 --> 36:49.940
When this force is released at once,

36:51.250 --> 36:54.500
this realm is completely extinguished.

36:55.500 --> 37:00.270
To counter this catastrophe we
need the power of Dragon Cry.

37:02.400 --> 37:04.999
We want to use Dragon Cry,

37:05.000 --> 37:07.190
which says it can trigger any shine.

37:07.460 --> 37:11.646
Tomorrow night we will be doing a ritual
in the temple, northwest of the city.

37:11.670 --> 37:13.400
To clear the light.

37:14.260 --> 37:16.340
If this is done to him, this kingdom...

37:16.900 --> 37:19.520
Even if the Stellanium disappears.

37:20.050 --> 37:22.990
This is the only way to save our empire.

37:24.130 --> 37:28.010
Therefore, we can not return the Staff!

37:28.210 --> 37:31.950
But this Staff is originally in
the possession of our kingdom.

37:32.340 --> 37:34.070
Even if that is the case...

37:34.950 --> 37:39.060
I can only rely on the power of the
Staff who can save our empire...

37:39.080 --> 37:41.000
This does not work with this Staff!

37:42.570 --> 37:45.690
When I held it in my
hands, I felt the anger,

37:45.890 --> 37:48.640
The pain and suffering of the dragons.

37:49.380 --> 37:52.510
The magical power of this
wand must not be unleashed!

37:52.910 --> 37:55.480
Are you saying that this
empire will perish?!

37:55.720 --> 37:57.060
I will do get it if I have to!

37:58.810 --> 38:02.220
I will tell the whole kingdom!

38:02.760 --> 38:04.400
Give us back the Staff!

38:05.240 --> 38:08.110
That's impossible...

38:15.610 --> 38:19.170
I told you that you should
not expose Sonya danger.

38:19.900 --> 38:24.020
That you simply use the Staff and blow them
away with the enemies...

38:24.290 --> 38:26.220
I'm heartbroken...

38:26.790 --> 38:28.910
I had lost my composure...

38:31.160 --> 38:33.540
Tomorrow will be the important ceremony.

38:33.900 --> 38:35.640
They will definitely come.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.610
Then kill them.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.250
And right this time.

38:39.700 --> 38:40.620
Yes, Sir...

38:46.050 --> 38:47.470
I will kill them.

38:48.110 --> 38:50.150
And then you too.

38:52.670 --> 38:54.670
It is beautiful here!

38:55.210 --> 38:57.720
What is growing on the trees?

38:57.740 --> 38:59.150
You must not eat them!

38:59.570 --> 39:01.606
Today we will camp here.

39:01.630 --> 39:04.026
Hopefully they do not attack us again.

39:04.050 --> 39:05.750
Let us keep turns standing guard.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.640
Yeah, that's a good idea.

39:07.650 --> 39:09.176
First, it's my turn.

39:09.200 --> 39:10.470
Sleeping?!

39:12.610 --> 39:17.540
So they want to use Dragon Cry to get rid
of all the shine of the Stellanium.

39:18.150 --> 39:20.860
Is this really possible?

39:20.970 --> 39:22.370
Even if they succeed,

39:22.640 --> 39:24.900
The economy of this empire
goes down the drain.

39:25.320 --> 39:29.610
Either way, they can not use
the magic power of the Staff.

39:30.010 --> 39:30.760
Yeah.

39:31.020 --> 39:34.000
She said that they will
hold a ritual tomorrow.

39:34.620 --> 39:36.840
Before that, we must recover the Staff.

39:36.960 --> 39:38.806
I will do my best.

39:38.830 --> 39:41.150
Hey, what are you eating?!

39:53.100 --> 39:55.950
What's the matter, Lucy?
Can not you sleep?

39:56.090 --> 39:59.440
Well, I'm off guard now.

39:59.700 --> 40:01.880
But you're dreaming of it.

40:05.000 --> 40:09.030
If you know our mission
is to get the Staff back,

40:09.710 --> 40:12.940
But then this kingdom will
probably disappear...

40:16.130 --> 40:17.320
Come up here.

40:17.720 --> 40:19.240
No, I'm wearing a skirt!

40:19.510 --> 40:21.090
Come on!

40:21.450 --> 40:23.590
What do you want?

40:26.260 --> 40:28.620
Wait a moment! How much more to go?

40:31.440 --> 40:33.560
Here, I'll lend you a hand.

40:45.980 --> 40:47.440
Stella's stars!

40:49.120 --> 40:50.360
Beautiful!

40:51.980 --> 40:53.840
You wanted to see them.

40:57.740 --> 41:01.720
Then do not let your head hang!

41:03.750 --> 41:04.550
Yeah!

41:16.470 --> 41:19.646
What is this?
Today there are many soldiers.

41:19.670 --> 41:20.370
Right.

41:20.670 --> 41:22.346
Oh, something happened?

41:22.370 --> 41:25.256
The all look as venerable as Gray.

41:25.280 --> 41:27.140
Hey, that emblem!

41:27.420 --> 41:29.990
There they are, Fairy Tail!

41:30.170 --> 41:30.736
What?

41:30.760 --> 41:34.136
Huh, what?
What have we done?

41:34.160 --> 41:35.210
What does this mean?

41:35.230 --> 41:37.100
That means trouble.

41:37.110 --> 41:38.100
Indeed...

41:38.810 --> 41:39.990
Finish them!

41:40.230 --> 41:42.736
Let me get into trouble.

41:42.760 --> 41:44.190
Come here!

41:44.950 --> 41:46.910
I will investigate the situation!

41:49.800 --> 41:52.036
On the other hand seems something happened.

41:52.060 --> 41:53.446
I'll take a look at it fast!

41:53.470 --> 41:54.860
Please take care of yourself!

41:55.320 --> 41:57.520
Seems like they were ready for us.

42:03.420 --> 42:05.630
Leave it to me!
Get to the temple!

42:05.860 --> 42:06.730
Got it!

42:06.880 --> 42:08.920
Let's go!
Aye, Sir!

42:09.160 --> 42:11.350
Happy, why are you red?!

42:13.600 --> 42:16.260
Is this about of the fruit
that I ate yesterday?

42:28.210 --> 42:31.230
I've been waiting for you, Red-haired Brat.

42:31.470 --> 42:32.629
The one with the legs!

42:32.630 --> 42:33.500
Nope,

42:34.400 --> 42:36.190
with the pretty legs.

42:57.530 --> 42:58.790
My dear Gray!

42:58.890 --> 43:00.090
Juvia?!

43:00.250 --> 43:01.700
W... What are you doing here?!

43:02.150 --> 43:06.150
My Gray-Sensor was not wrong!

43:07.030 --> 43:10.190
Can it be that you have a Juvia sensor?

43:10.350 --> 43:11.470
What do I know?

43:19.510 --> 43:20.990
Francis, Catherine,

43:22.560 --> 43:23.820
There is work to be done!

43:24.310 --> 43:26.830
What is the meaning of this uproar?

43:27.030 --> 43:28.870
Well, a lot has happened.

43:29.310 --> 43:30.470
Help me first.

43:30.860 --> 43:31.730
Gladly!

43:45.670 --> 43:46.670
Too slow!

43:49.570 --> 43:51.090
I'll stop him.

43:51.400 --> 43:52.360
Go ahead!

43:52.610 --> 43:53.910
Carla, you too?!

44:16.210 --> 44:17.810
I am stronger than you!

44:19.800 --> 44:21.960
We leave you, Wendy, Carla!

44:23.040 --> 44:24.210
But, I...

44:24.970 --> 44:26.600
You can not escape!

44:36.710 --> 44:37.440
What?!

44:43.050 --> 44:44.390
That was close.

44:45.330 --> 44:49.290
I will quickly free the girls
from the cellar of the castle.

44:49.580 --> 44:51.180
Can you manage this alone?

44:51.860 --> 44:53.130
I'm not alone.

44:54.290 --> 44:56.030
My celestial spirits are at my side!

44:58.490 --> 45:01.230
Happy, we will stop the ritual!

45:01.780 --> 45:03.020
Aye, Sir!

45:10.180 --> 45:13.230
When I held it in my
hands, I felt the anger,

45:13.420 --> 45:15.990
The pain suffering of the dragons.

45:16.750 --> 45:19.660
The magical power of this
Staff must not be unleashed!

45:33.110 --> 45:34.100
Sonya...

45:37.410 --> 45:38.780
King Animus...

45:39.570 --> 45:42.570
Come on, give me Dragon Cry.

45:44.140 --> 45:46.580
This force plunges people into misfortune.

45:48.090 --> 45:49.690
I can not give you the Staff.

45:50.920 --> 45:53.450
Everybody, run while there is still time!

45:53.740 --> 45:55.570
Hurry up, before he comes!

45:55.920 --> 45:58.650
Thank you... so much...

46:01.840 --> 46:02.700
Hurry up!

46:02.800 --> 46:04.349
Where is the Staff?!

46:04.350 --> 46:06.440
Lord Zash is back!

46:07.110 --> 46:07.950
No!

46:08.140 --> 46:10.080
What are you doing here?!

46:10.600 --> 46:11.930
Quickly, go!

46:12.220 --> 46:13.720
Do not play games!

46:14.830 --> 46:17.090
Open, gate of Capricorn!

46:23.560 --> 46:24.750
Capricorn!

46:26.580 --> 46:29.760
A goat? Are you kidding me?!

46:57.590 --> 47:01.670
It seems like your magic does not work
when you hide your eyes.

47:02.070 --> 47:03.480
Excellent, Master Lucy.

47:04.570 --> 47:06.290
I am impressed.

47:11.060 --> 47:13.060
Now! To the exit!

47:16.740 --> 47:19.440
I'll help you escape.

47:22.030 --> 47:24.820
This is not the right time now.

47:25.140 --> 47:26.980
Red Knife, let's go!

47:34.610 --> 47:35.810
Since I was probably unlucky.

47:37.730 --> 47:39.040
Where is he going?

47:39.250 --> 47:40.390
Let us follow him.

48:41.180 --> 48:41.910
What?!

48:50.820 --> 48:53.610
Francis, Catherine.

49:02.240 --> 49:04.700
Ice does not work against me!

49:06.570 --> 49:08.820
He destroys his own city!

49:10.070 --> 49:10.820
Watch out!

49:14.190 --> 49:15.100
Juvia!

49:23.240 --> 49:24.690
Hey, Onee-Chan!

49:27.960 --> 49:30.720
Good work, Catherine.

49:49.790 --> 49:51.370
Good shot.

49:52.090 --> 49:55.190
And that even though we use a speed spell!

49:55.480 --> 49:56.870
He's too fast for us.

50:13.540 --> 50:16.190
Look! I can see you!

50:20.440 --> 50:22.630
Wendy, I have a good idea.

50:22.760 --> 50:23.540
What?

50:26.190 --> 50:28.910
Your life is over between that in the end!

50:33.390 --> 50:35.730
Carla, he's catching up with us!

50:36.080 --> 50:38.380
Let us coordinate our breathing!

50:38.650 --> 50:39.280
Yeah!

50:40.630 --> 50:42.430
One, two...

50:44.220 --> 50:44.850
three.

51:02.080 --> 51:03.490
That's it!

51:09.620 --> 51:10.720
That can not be!

51:11.240 --> 51:16.150
An ice that is not melted by
Francis and Catherine's heat?!

51:17.290 --> 51:19.350
This is the ice of an exorcist.

51:20.340 --> 51:21.870
That's perfect.

51:22.500 --> 51:25.940
Your dolls also seem to be cursed.

51:27.480 --> 51:31.020
You make fun of my children?

51:31.720 --> 51:33.740
Francis, Catherine!

52:01.190 --> 52:03.540
My d... dear Gray!

52:10.890 --> 52:14.380
Female rivals!

52:15.680 --> 52:18.060
Reach him! Wings of love!

52:18.280 --> 52:20.910
My dear Gray, Max Love!

52:31.580 --> 52:32.440
Beautiful!

52:34.730 --> 52:36.860
Francis, Catherine...

52:59.380 --> 53:01.460
Juvia, are you all right?

53:01.940 --> 53:03.920
Yes, my darling...

53:06.560 --> 53:07.630
Gray...

53:56.810 --> 53:58.160
Grand Fouette!

54:22.950 --> 54:25.150
Impossible! When did you do that?

54:25.520 --> 54:28.260
When I saw your clever leg attacks,

54:28.360 --> 54:30.520
I thought, I could do that too.

54:30.810 --> 54:31.730
You...

54:31.750 --> 54:33.640
Impossible!

54:36.630 --> 54:37.816
Adorable!

54:37.840 --> 54:41.930
But my kicks enchant all men!

54:42.440 --> 54:45.830
I do not have to enchant all men!

54:46.700 --> 54:49.060
Let the seven stars be your judgment.

54:50.620 --> 54:52.080
Grand Chariot!

55:34.380 --> 55:36.240
What's with your attitude?

55:37.810 --> 55:40.090
Quickly give me Dragon Cry.

55:41.230 --> 55:42.230
I...

55:42.830 --> 55:44.200
Give us the Staff back.

55:44.310 --> 55:45.400
Back!

55:45.570 --> 55:46.250
Huh?

55:46.810 --> 55:47.330
Huh?

55:48.240 --> 55:49.430
Sonya?

55:50.380 --> 55:50.960
Huh?

55:52.910 --> 55:54.100
Where is the king?

55:54.480 --> 55:57.250
Why are you holding the Staff, Sonya?

55:59.880 --> 56:02.586
To give it to the king when he was here...

56:02.610 --> 56:04.156
Give us the Staff!

56:04.180 --> 56:07.069
No... that... well...

56:07.070 --> 56:09.530
You can not give it him the Staff.

56:13.150 --> 56:14.070
Sonya?

56:14.230 --> 56:17.626
There is no time left for us.
Bring me Dragon Cry...

56:17.650 --> 56:19.510
Tomorrow will be the important ceremony.

56:19.650 --> 56:21.760
Why does not he bring it to me?

56:22.270 --> 56:24.340
They will definitely come.

56:29.800 --> 56:31.410
You will be dead.

56:32.330 --> 56:33.750
And right this time.

56:36.590 --> 56:37.510
The king.

56:38.410 --> 56:39.490
I am?

56:40.070 --> 56:42.600
Did you recognize it now Sonya?

56:43.120 --> 56:43.880
Majesty...

56:44.160 --> 56:45.900
You and me...

56:46.600 --> 56:48.500
are one and the same person.

56:51.780 --> 56:52.820
Sonya!

57:06.860 --> 57:09.580
W... Who are you?

57:11.830 --> 57:13.820
I am Animus.

57:15.230 --> 57:16.960
I am in Sonya's body.

57:18.870 --> 57:20.320
I'm a dragon.

57:21.510 --> 57:22.510
A dragon?

57:26.440 --> 57:28.750
What is your intention?

57:29.150 --> 57:34.070
Did you not want to prevent the explosion
of the Stellanium with this Staff?

57:35.630 --> 57:39.690
Little Sonya... That she asked
such silly words are believed.

57:40.440 --> 57:42.200
What an obedient girl.

57:43.310 --> 57:48.930
My intention is to get out of
this disgusting human body.

57:49.880 --> 57:52.620
Igneel had managed to get out by himself.

57:53.050 --> 57:55.900
You know Igneel?

57:57.270 --> 58:01.320
Igneel crawled into the
interior of a Dragon Slayer.

58:01.860 --> 58:05.330
He crawled into the ideal body.

58:06.180 --> 58:09.590
However, I did not have
time to make a selection.

58:10.400 --> 58:14.250
I entered the almost dead Sonya,
who happened to be close by.

58:14.470 --> 58:16.260
And have been waiting so far,

58:16.600 --> 58:20.810
Therefore, I could not get
out of my own free will.

58:21.420 --> 58:24.970
But now, I hold Dragon Cry in my hands!

58:29.310 --> 58:32.690
This Staff reinforces
the power of a dragon.

58:33.370 --> 58:35.040
I'll be free!

58:35.290 --> 58:37.390
I will not allow that!

58:40.340 --> 58:43.700
Surely you are not that of Igneel.

58:46.780 --> 58:48.640
Natsu, take the Staff!

58:48.750 --> 58:49.650
Sonya...

58:49.770 --> 58:51.130
Hurry while there is time!

58:51.150 --> 58:52.690
Leave it, Sonya!

58:54.200 --> 58:55.710
Natsu!

59:00.090 --> 59:02.580
I'll take Dragon Cry!

59:02.690 --> 59:04.580
A... A dog!

59:05.960 --> 59:07.380
Lord Zash!

59:07.650 --> 59:11.640
Animus?
No, now you are probably Sonya...

59:12.380 --> 59:17.630
As king you have given me orders and when
Sonya you were reporting to me.

59:18.810 --> 59:22.880
I'm sick of your one-man-piece.

59:23.200 --> 59:26.770
What... have you... with the Staff?

59:27.930 --> 59:30.830
I will use it to avenge myself on Fiore!

59:33.330 --> 59:37.220
Dragon Cry is a highly compressed
of Ethernano condensate.

59:37.630 --> 59:39.250
If I release it,

59:39.270 --> 59:43.220
I can unleash a magical power that is
tens of times stronger than Etherion!

59:43.710 --> 59:49.160
I will extinguish Fiore, who despised
my magic as black magic and exiled me!

59:49.800 --> 59:51.190
With my own hands!

59:51.570 --> 59:52.620
Red Knife!

59:53.240 --> 59:55.760
They are your food.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:01.830
Wait!

01:00:06.010 --> 01:00:08.760
I will not allow you to
hurt Natsu and Sonya.

01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:11.410
I am, Red Happy!

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:14.030
I'm not afraid of you.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.170
That was great, Happy!

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:37.360
Oh, Lucy!

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:39.540
Happy!

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.710
Curse you Zash!

01:00:42.610 --> 01:00:43.480
Sonya!

01:00:44.370 --> 01:00:46.120
No, who are you?!

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.580
Unforgivable!

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:08.940
A dragon!

01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:20.860
Take care of Happy and Sonya.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.420
Not at all, your Majesty!

01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:36.060
Be more careful with the historical
buildings of our empire.

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.880
Give me the Staff, Zash!

01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:41.700
You really wanted to
take this shape or not!

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:44.520
You have accomplished your goal anyway?

01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:47.060
This form is not perfect.

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:50.460
This is not the freedom, I wanted!

01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:54.700
Then I'll give you freedom.

01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:57.340
Your Majesty, you were really lucky.

01:02:07.610 --> 01:02:09.360
Rage as much as you want...

01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:11.670
Completely free.

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:32.400
There still seem to be a few
fairies still hanging around.

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:38.840
Perhaps I should use them, developed
in secret for a situation like today.

01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:42.360
Come here, Quartum Army!

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.450
What kind of guys are they?

01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:04.510
Soldiers?

01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:07.010
Th... These are really many!

01:03:10.610 --> 01:03:11.240
Wendy!

01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:17.050
What a force!

01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:25.910
Quartum Army, keep Fairy
Tail busy and give me time!

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:34.430
Who are they?!

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:36.660
The Quartum Army.

01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:39.210
They are the fourth generation
of the Dragon Slayer.

01:03:39.310 --> 01:03:40.550
The fourth generation?!

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:44.660
They are artificial soldiers created
with Dragon Slayer Lacrima.

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.200
Open, gate of the Shooter!

01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:54.400
Sagittarius!

01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:55.840
Hello!

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.990
We aim at every one of them!

01:03:58.090 --> 01:03:59.680
All right!

01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:27.280
The Staff is above us?

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:37.950
Oh, Dragon Cry, show me your true power!

01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:49.030
Mr. Father, that is...

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.980
Dragon Cry.

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:55.590
Hisu, evacuate all the
people of the kingdom!

01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:57.550
We must hurry,

01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:02.800
The wrath and the hatred of the dragons
will rain on us!

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:04.700
What's going on?!

01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:09.900
That looks bad!

01:05:10.170 --> 01:05:11.400
It's time!

01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:13.710
Oh, you deceased dragons,

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.646
Make an iron hammer out of your rage...

01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:18.330
and strike down with it.

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:25.220
That bastard!

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:33.340
Happy!

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:35.220
I'll fly you to the top of the tower!

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:36.020
Gladly!

01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:37.520
Aye, Sir!

01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:46.190
I can feel it!

01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:49.540
The entire continent is a magic circle!

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:52.060
Disappearing, Fio...

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:56.470
What is it?

01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:17.250
What is this?

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:18.896
Dragon Cry!

01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:21.306
Natsu, it is definitely out of control!

01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:22.770
We must stop him!

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:29.140
The Staff is mine!

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.306
Give it to me!

01:06:30.330 --> 01:06:31.440
No way!

01:06:38.810 --> 01:06:39.820
Happy!

01:06:56.620 --> 01:07:00.010
You are actually a Dragon Slayer!

01:07:00.110 --> 01:07:01.320
Yeah, and?

01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:05.640
Because of guys like you, the
dragons have disappeared!

01:07:06.110 --> 01:07:08.730
You have robbed us of our freedom!

01:07:09.110 --> 01:07:11.889
This time I will give you people.

01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:15.310
The wrath of the dragons taste!

01:07:48.170 --> 01:07:48.570
Huh?

01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:54.690
Huh?

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:01.020
Na... Natsu!

01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:20.520
Dragon Cry, grant me my full power now!

01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:35.430
The fight between the dragons
and the Dragon Slayers

01:08:35.689 --> 01:08:37.810
has come to an end.

01:08:38.479 --> 01:08:42.050
From now on, the age of dragons!

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.770
Please stop, Majesty!

01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:49.276
Stop aside!

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:51.149
No, I can't!

01:08:51.310 --> 01:08:54.410
I will not allow you to hurt
these people even more!

01:08:55.770 --> 01:08:59.069
Their souls are closely linked.

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:03.350
They shine like the stars of this world!

01:09:04.370 --> 01:09:05.279
However,

01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:10.850
your souls has lost its luster.

01:09:11.350 --> 01:09:12.779
And is in deep darkness.

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:19.149
You were a friendly person in the past...

01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:22.319
Natsu!

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:24.050
Natsu!

01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:24.960
Natsu!

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:27.100
Get up!

01:09:27.270 --> 01:09:29.310
Natsu!

01:09:29.609 --> 01:09:31.189
Stand up, Natsu!

01:09:31.710 --> 01:09:32.630
Natsu!

01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:24.680
Natsu!
Natsu!

01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:32.570
So your still alive,

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:35.730
You creatures that exist
only to destroy dragons?

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:49.630
I'm... not fighting to destroy dragons...

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:52.470
To my comrades.

01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:54.130
To protect...

01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:57.360
Only for that.

01:10:58.290 --> 01:10:59.550
I fight!

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:03.000
Here and now!

01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:05.340
Be quiet!

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:18.270
You rat!

01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:40.810
You disgusting man...

01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:04.430
You're also a dragon?!

01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:28.330
I have recognized you, your true form!

01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:30.790
You're not human!

01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:33.846
You are the being who
will destroy everything!

01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:38.420
Me does not matter what I am!

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:43.440
I have devoted my existence
completely to my comrades!

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.220
Blood meat or bone...

01:12:54.690 --> 01:12:58.350
I need nothing of it!

01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:12.390
Natsu...

01:14:13.370 --> 01:14:15.190
The sky is normal again!

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:20.900
Did you manage, Fairy Tail?

01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:33.810
Natsu!

01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:47.440
Natsu...

01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:50.550
Lucy...

01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:56.520
How?

01:14:57.930 --> 01:14:59.160
Do I look?

01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:04.830
Like Natsu. It is obvious.

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:17.280
My body.

01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:21.590
Dissolves on...

01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:23.500
Majesty,

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:30.620
I thank you for everything.

01:15:32.130 --> 01:15:34.110
That you have raised me up...

01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:41.300
Sonya, I saw it for the first time...

01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:43.320
Your...

01:15:44.650 --> 01:15:45.650
Smile...

01:15:48.370 --> 01:15:50.760
Where are you now?

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.000
The tear...

01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:56.010
of a Dragon.

01:16:00.150 --> 01:16:02.480
Look, Dragon Cry!

01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:11.350
A band?

01:16:11.970 --> 01:16:14.950
Was this his original form?

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.150
It has disappeared somewhere.

01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:21.590
Lucy.

01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:22.540
Huh?

01:16:27.810 --> 01:16:28.820
The king...

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:33.806
has deceived the people and me.

01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:35.750
He lied to himself.

01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:41.960
And to satisfy his self-interest,
he has called this situation.

01:16:44.650 --> 01:16:47.150
He has hurt many people.

01:16:48.850 --> 01:16:50.800
He was a bad person.

01:16:51.170 --> 01:16:52.020
Yet,

01:16:53.090 --> 01:16:56.280
He was something like family to me.

01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:01.690
Even if, he used me,

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:04.920
I was happy that he was by my side.

01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:10.030
If possible, I would have
given him other ways and...

01:17:11.050 --> 01:17:14.090
On a mutually supportive basis.

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:16.670
I want to help.

01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:22.810
Just like you.

01:17:27.270 --> 01:17:29.970
The guild is our family, is not it?

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.100
Aye!

01:17:34.090 --> 01:17:34.980
Right.

01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:27.150
Help! Help!

01:22:30.850 --> 01:22:35.940
Perfect. This little
girl will satisfied us.

01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:42.190
I am the Dragon Slayer Acnologia.

01:22:42.830 --> 01:22:45.970
I will destroy the dragons.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.110
I'm sorry, I couldn't save you.

01:23:07.570 --> 01:23:11.000
I will destroy all dragons.

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:15.530
Acnologia...

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:21.320
I don't want to die yet...

01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:22.980
Not yet...

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:28.880
This girl... is still alive...

01:23:31.690 --> 01:23:34.470
Girl, tell me your name.

01:23:35.090 --> 01:23:39.240
If you do it, we can probably both survive.

01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:42.560
Sonya...

01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:50.030
Silly...

01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:57.870
This is Acnologia.

01:23:58.480 --> 01:23:59.960
Our enemy.

01:24:03.490 --> 01:24:05.410
The battle has begun,

01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:07.070
Natsu.
