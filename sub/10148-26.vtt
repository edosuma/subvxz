WEBVTT

01:17.245 --> 01:19.121
- Ten minutes.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:33.719 --> 01:35.919
What's the matter, the other one
not good enough for ya?

01:42.812 --> 01:43.896
What's the matter now?

01:43.980 --> 01:44.980
Whoa!

01:49.902 --> 01:50.778
Whoa!

01:50.861 --> 01:51.946
Heel! Stop!

01:53.572 --> 01:54.572
Slag it.

02:05.334 --> 02:06.334
OW!

02:06.711 --> 02:07.837
Let him go, Ace.

02:11.173 --> 02:12.173
I said let him...

02:12.466 --> 02:13.466
Jeez!

02:15.553 --> 02:16.804
What's gotten into...

02:17.013 --> 02:18.013
Hey!

02:23.477 --> 02:24.477
Burn it.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.330
How come you never
put a tracer on the mutt?

02:42.496 --> 02:43.956
<i>He never ran away from me.</i>

02:44.498 --> 02:46.375
I ran the serial number from the gun.

02:46.709 --> 02:49.269
According to the records,
it was destroyed in the police impound.

02:49.545 --> 02:51.339
So the guy had an illegal blaster.

02:51.422 --> 02:53.799
We need to find out, why, who he is,

02:53.966 --> 02:55.217
what he needs that gun for.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.845
- As soon as I find Ace...
<i>- No. Now.</i>

02:57.928 --> 02:59.488
You want me to just leave him out here?

02:59.722 --> 03:01.807
Ace is a survivor. He'll be all right.

03:02.016 --> 03:03.267
I hope somebody told him that.

03:30.878 --> 03:31.879
That looks right.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.672
Close enough. Hit it.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.889
You really believe
Ace recognized this guy?

03:42.098 --> 03:43.224
It's possible.

03:43.307 --> 03:44.892
Either way, it's our only lead.

03:50.106 --> 03:51.524
- That him?
- Yeah.

03:51.774 --> 03:53.984
- Who is he?
- Ronny Boxer.

03:54.068 --> 03:56.862
He's got a dense rap file
for illegal sporting events.

03:57.071 --> 03:59.281
Dog sports. The scum.

03:59.657 --> 04:02.701
Yes, and now we know
where Ace knows him from.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.292
Big, black.

04:10.376 --> 04:12.378
A Dane mix. He's got tags.

04:12.628 --> 04:14.839
<i>Nothing's been
reported in any of the shelters.</i>

04:15.047 --> 04:16.632
He's a very resourceful dog.

04:16.841 --> 04:20.845
<i>Rest assured, sir, if he's out there
we'll catch him. It's what we do.</i>

04:21.303 --> 04:23.472
No luck from the shelters
and you're still not worried?

04:23.681 --> 04:24.890
I don't worry.

04:25.808 --> 04:27.726
- What's that?
- Undercover ploy.

04:28.102 --> 04:30.330
I found someone who could lead me
to our friend Ronny Boxer.

04:30.354 --> 04:31.914
I just have to trick him into doing it.

04:31.981 --> 04:32.898
And who knows,

04:32.982 --> 04:34.984
maybe I'll get a lead
on Ace from him, too.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.701
What did he do to you, boy?

04:53.669 --> 04:54.962
What do you got for me, Maddie?

04:55.421 --> 04:56.839
Over here, Mr. Boxer.

04:56.922 --> 04:58.591
Got a litter a couple of weeks ago.

04:58.674 --> 05:00.009
Saved the best one for you.

05:07.892 --> 05:09.101
Look at these mitts.

05:09.310 --> 05:11.312
Gonna be huge. A mangler.

05:13.397 --> 05:15.483
After I get through training him,
he will.

05:16.442 --> 05:17.902
Take care of the paperwork.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.236
Don't I always?

05:44.094 --> 05:45.763
Come on, you scrawny little mutt.

05:48.057 --> 05:49.177
Show me what you're made of.

05:49.642 --> 05:51.101
Go for it. Go for it.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.356
That's it, fella, tear it up.

05:56.398 --> 05:57.398
I want you mean.

06:09.370 --> 06:12.665
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
online viewing is about to begin.</i>

06:14.291 --> 06:15.691
I think the pup's outmatched, boss.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.253
Win or lose,

06:17.461 --> 06:19.171
the crowd is gonna eat it up.

06:19.380 --> 06:20.673
But the pup could get hurt.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.634
He turns out a loser,
he goes back to the pound.

06:25.636 --> 06:27.054
Eh, plenty more where he came from.

06:31.100 --> 06:32.768
<i>Gotham Police, nobody moves.</i>

06:38.440 --> 06:41.402
<i>Due to technical difficulties,
tonight's match has been postponed...</i>

06:42.820 --> 06:43.946
Freeze!

07:03.924 --> 07:05.759
Hey, hey! That's my dog.

07:06.635 --> 07:08.262
Not anymore, he's not.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.921
- Nice neighborhood, eh?
- Not really.

07:43.922 --> 07:46.008
- It was a joke.
- Stop here.

07:48.427 --> 07:49.427
Here?

07:53.849 --> 07:55.392
You sure you got the right address?

07:55.684 --> 07:58.145
Yes. My parents were killed here.

07:58.646 --> 07:59.772
A long time ago.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.066
- You can stay in the car.
- Right.

08:02.191 --> 08:03.233
Thank you, sir.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.245
Ho, ho, ho!

08:15.412 --> 08:17.206
Got your Tannenbaum here.

08:17.289 --> 08:18.916
How about a little Christmas cred?

08:53.033 --> 08:54.993
Ah! Get off me.

09:05.587 --> 09:06.672
Get out of here.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.312
Don't worry, boy.

09:22.688 --> 09:24.648
I won't ever let anyone hurt you again.

09:36.201 --> 09:38.662
Okay, boy. Nice and easy.

09:58.682 --> 10:01.101
Okay, mutt. If it's a fight you want...

10:18.202 --> 10:19.036
Hey.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.621
Wait a minute. I didn't do nothing.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.415
- What's your problem?
- I don't know.

10:23.499 --> 10:24.541
OW!

10:24.625 --> 10:25.665
Why were you following us?

10:25.918 --> 10:27.127
I wasn't following you.

10:27.211 --> 10:28.337
I was following him.

10:30.380 --> 10:31.840
- Do I know you?
- No.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.342
But you're gonna want to.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.304
Talk to me.

10:37.387 --> 10:39.389
I heard your boss was looking
for sport dogs.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.475
I got one at home that's a born brawler.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.101
A real winner. Not afraid of no one.

10:43.352 --> 10:44.478
Look, what he did here.

10:44.561 --> 10:45.813
And me he likes.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.154
Takes more than teeth
to make a good sport dog.

10:49.399 --> 10:52.402
But if he's got half the juice you got,
he might be worth a scan.

10:53.070 --> 10:55.489
You give this guy a call.
Tell him Ozzie sent ya.

11:03.747 --> 11:06.124
Wayne, it's me.
I got a number for you to trace.

11:22.266 --> 11:23.600
Not this time, Fido.

11:23.767 --> 11:24.768
Don't fight it, fella.

11:25.102 --> 11:26.520
Don't want you to hurt yourself.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.023
You could be worth a lot of money to me.

11:30.107 --> 11:31.275
Tough guy like you.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.694
As long as you don't belong to no one.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.663
You sure this is Ronny Boxer's place?

11:44.913 --> 11:46.540
Looks more like chem lab 101.

11:46.623 --> 11:47.623
I'm <i>sure.</i>

11:48.584 --> 11:50.711
I wouldn't wanna be
sleeping next to this stuff.

11:50.961 --> 11:53.641
He's got enough trithane to supply
every hospital on the East Coast.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.549
<i>- Trithane?</i>
- Yeah.

11:55.883 --> 11:56.967
And some metatonin.

11:57.509 --> 11:58.509
Zirconite.

11:58.844 --> 12:00.470
And this one I can't even pronounce.

12:01.096 --> 12:02.681
Zeltanic methylchlorine?

12:03.181 --> 12:04.349
You're scaring me.

12:05.017 --> 12:07.895
<i>It's the final ingredient
in making the serostone.</i>

12:08.103 --> 12:09.103
The growth hormone?

12:09.271 --> 12:11.398
<i>He must be using it on the dogs.</i>

12:11.732 --> 12:13.233
<i>Turning them into monsters.</i>

12:13.650 --> 12:15.360
And I thought
he couldn't stoop any lower.

12:15.444 --> 12:17.696
All in the name of profit, Batman.

13:15.671 --> 13:16.671
<i>You okay?</i>

13:17.422 --> 13:19.257
Yeah, but Ronny got away again.

13:23.553 --> 13:24.805
Shut your yap.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.144
What you doing here, Maddie?

13:31.228 --> 13:32.437
I don't have time for games.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.398
Got a dog for you, Mr. Boxer.

13:34.690 --> 13:35.690
He's a real contender.

13:39.528 --> 13:40.654
You trying to cheat me?

13:41.405 --> 13:42.823
Selling me back my own mutt?

13:43.073 --> 13:45.659
- What? I swear, I-
- Slag it.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.328
Must be fate, me and this pooch.

13:48.912 --> 13:52.040
We were meant to be together,
ain't that right, boy?

13:56.837 --> 13:59.339
Put him below,
I'II deal with him after the games.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.177
And if nothing else,

14:04.261 --> 14:06.847
he'll make a nice playmate
for the other dogs.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.435
I thought I might be able
to get a bead on Ronny's car.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.078
But I lost too much time with the fire.

14:13.270 --> 14:15.814
<i>You're in luck. I got a lead on the web.</i>

14:16.606 --> 14:18.775
<i>Tonight's dog games
are a floating event.</i>

14:18.859 --> 14:20.944
<i>It's on an old barge down at Pier 22.</i>

14:51.892 --> 14:53.560
Ronny's been busy
with his chemistry set.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.062
These dogs are huge.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.980
<i>Don't worry about the dogs.</i>

14:57.064 --> 14:58.398
<i>Worry about the people.</i>

15:06.615 --> 15:07.615
We're moving.

15:10.285 --> 15:12.871
<i>They must be taking
the barge offshore to start the games.</i>

15:13.789 --> 15:14.956
Then where is everybody?

15:24.174 --> 15:27.344
Things are a whole lot simpler
than they used to be, Batman.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.640
Everything's automated.

15:34.059 --> 15:35.393
Don't need cameramen.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.104
Don't even need handlers.

15:43.527 --> 15:46.279
I control all the action
with the touch of a button.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.199
You wanna know what's behind
door number one, Batman?

15:54.162 --> 15:56.623
One of your serostone creations.
I saw them.

15:57.082 --> 15:58.333
Not this one, you didn't.

16:03.547 --> 16:05.799
He's my first experiment with the stuff.

16:06.007 --> 16:07.551
Guess I went a little overboard.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.427
I was gonna put him out to pasture

16:09.511 --> 16:11.429
but I always knew
I'd find a use for him.

16:19.855 --> 16:22.232
Down, boy, I'm not gonna hurt you.

16:22.649 --> 16:23.649
Much.

17:22.918 --> 17:25.337
You're more entertaining
than some of my dogs, Batman.

17:26.838 --> 17:29.257
But I've got a webcast to put on
in about ten minutes

17:29.341 --> 17:32.385
so I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
put this in the express lane.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.218
Good dog.

18:55.552 --> 18:56.845
What'd you do with Ronny?

18:59.389 --> 19:00.265
Help!

19:00.348 --> 19:01.766
Somebody. Anybody.

19:01.850 --> 19:03.101
Help.
