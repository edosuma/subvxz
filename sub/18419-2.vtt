WEBVTT

01:35.196 --> 01:36.797
In our favor, however,

01:36.864 --> 01:40.801
an enemy who underestimates
the strength of our resolve.

01:40.868 --> 01:45.005
And in war, surprise
is a formidable weapon.

01:45.072 --> 01:46.774
Given our numbers,

01:46.840 --> 01:50.311
the last thing the Americans
expected was a frontal assault.

01:50.378 --> 01:52.480
So...

01:55.749 --> 01:59.520
...that is precisely
what I ordered.

01:59.587 --> 02:00.788
And it worked?

02:01.989 --> 02:04.625
Would you have
tolerated my stories

02:04.692 --> 02:06.194
if it had not?

02:24.612 --> 02:27.215
Heh heh,
drink some more.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.654
Where exactly are you
from, Chief Inspector?

02:38.392 --> 02:40.794
Do you not like
conversation?

02:52.506 --> 02:54.475
If you don't talk to me,
I'm not doing my job.

02:54.542 --> 02:57.311
And if I'm not doing
my job, I'll lose it.

02:58.246 --> 03:00.248
And I really need this.

03:04.985 --> 03:07.087
I am from Kohri-yama.

03:07.154 --> 03:10.858
That's an agricultural
area, right?

03:10.924 --> 03:12.426
My folks were farmers.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.829
Do you still
have family there?

03:16.964 --> 03:18.466
Two children.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.969
And my wife.

03:29.042 --> 03:32.646
There's a potted plant
right behind you,

03:32.713 --> 03:35.649
if you want to get rid
of that drink.

03:43.023 --> 03:47.295
I am on duty.
That is all.

03:48.296 --> 03:49.963
Are you ever not on duty?

03:56.203 --> 03:57.638
I'm sorry.
I was just wondering

03:57.705 --> 03:59.407
if it's that you don't
want to be here

03:59.473 --> 04:01.575
or if you're never
really anywhere.

04:05.679 --> 04:08.316
Just because that would
be kind of...

04:08.316 --> 04:10.318
sad, you know?

04:14.688 --> 04:17.325
No. Explain.

04:17.358 --> 04:20.761
Well, if your mind
is always elsewhere,

04:20.828 --> 04:25.232
in a way, you never really are
experience anything, right?

04:25.333 --> 04:27.535
Nothing's ever real.

05:18.251 --> 05:20.388
Can you please
give me a lift?

05:21.522 --> 05:22.890
What happened?

05:23.957 --> 05:25.993
Just a fight
with my boyfriend.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.132
Get in.

05:32.199 --> 05:33.501
Thank you.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.144
Let me see that.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.447
It's okay.
I was an army medic.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.416
Let's have a look.

05:53.220 --> 05:54.888
It's dislocated.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.323
Give me your wrist.

05:56.424 --> 05:57.625
Count to 3, okay?

05:57.691 --> 05:59.427
And you push it back in on 2.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.764
What's this?

06:03.831 --> 06:05.699
That's not gonna work,
either.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.718
Where exactly are you headed?

06:30.123 --> 06:32.359
He was executed, sir.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.695
The two men--
one white, one black--

06:34.762 --> 06:36.296
drove off
in that direction.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.698
The woman fled on foot.

06:37.765 --> 06:40.468
They left this one
behind.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.673
Establish
if she's Resistance.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.609
We're trying to
identify her now, sir.

06:50.210 --> 06:53.280
Why did they not flee
the scene together?

06:53.346 --> 06:56.016
I don't know.
Panic, perhaps?

07:32.285 --> 07:34.021
Not one of ours.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.925
The men were not just shooting
at the officer up there.

07:37.991 --> 07:41.194
They were also shooting at
the woman they arrived with.

07:41.261 --> 07:44.532
But...why?

07:45.533 --> 07:47.701
Round-ups in every
district, Sergeant.

07:47.768 --> 07:50.203
Reprisals will be severe.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.705
Hai.

08:07.555 --> 08:10.123
You said you were an ex-con.
Come on.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.601
You sure
this is her place?

08:20.668 --> 08:21.969
I'm sure.

08:51.932 --> 08:54.034
Maybe she beat us here.

08:57.470 --> 08:58.606
We'll wait.

08:58.639 --> 08:59.907
If the Pons
picked her up,

08:59.973 --> 09:01.609
they could be
back here any minute.

09:01.675 --> 09:04.077
If they did, we have
much bigger problems.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.614
Why? She can't take
anybody to him.

09:06.614 --> 09:08.148
She doesn't know where he is.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.417
We can't take that risk.

09:10.483 --> 09:14.221
Well, Gary,
everything got fucked up.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.023
Fucking them up more
won't bring Karen back.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.858
- Enough.
- I lost people, too.

09:17.925 --> 09:19.627
- Lem.
- If Karen was here,

09:19.693 --> 09:20.828
she'd tell you
the same damn thing!

09:20.894 --> 09:22.095
Shut the fuck up!

09:59.532 --> 10:00.968
Nasty-looking scar.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.873
On your back.

10:07.174 --> 10:09.276
This isn't the first
scrape you've been in.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.345
You're Resistance, right?

10:16.717 --> 10:18.051
I passed an ugly scene

10:18.118 --> 10:19.753
a couple miles
before I saw you--

10:19.820 --> 10:22.956
police, soldiers,

10:23.023 --> 10:25.759
girl lying dead in the road.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.695
You're sure she was dead?

10:30.563 --> 10:32.800
One thing I know is dead.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.744
I like to use this road
if I can.

10:43.811 --> 10:45.746
It's good to be reminded.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.984
A few miles that way,
there's a redwood grove

10:51.051 --> 10:54.087
where they all went near
the end, waiting to surrender.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.524
We set up a hospital,

10:57.590 --> 10:59.492
put boys
back on their feet

10:59.559 --> 11:01.261
that had no business
breathing.

11:02.629 --> 11:04.597
Then the Japs came through.

11:04.732 --> 11:06.333
Lined them all up.

11:07.735 --> 11:09.102
Women and kids, too.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.139
One bullet each
to the back of the head.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.941
Never more than one.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.345
Took about an hour.

11:23.216 --> 11:25.552
Used to be I thought
victory was winning.

11:25.618 --> 11:28.388
Then I convinced myself
it's surviving.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.761
The thing is--

11:33.827 --> 11:37.364
The truth is I know
I should do more.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.467
Like you folks.

11:59.686 --> 12:02.189
You killed us.
You do know that.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.024
You admitted
swindling the Yakuza.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.492
I didn't set up the deal.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.460
Wait.
You're not seriously
positing a reality

12:07.527 --> 12:09.029
in which any of this
is my fault?

12:09.096 --> 12:11.231
This time,
please do not talk.

12:47.034 --> 12:49.036
You want to work for us?

12:55.442 --> 12:57.978
It was a Nazi
who killed your men.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.847
I had no idea that was
going to happen --

12:59.913 --> 13:01.048
Oh, sweet Lesu--

13:01.114 --> 13:03.150
I stole from your lawyer

13:03.216 --> 13:06.186
to prove I can make you
a lot of money.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.656
What kind of
businessman are you?

13:09.722 --> 13:11.591
Clearly an excellent one.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.626
Sir, I have a list in my shop

13:13.693 --> 13:17.397
of buyers willing to pay vast
sums for old-time Americana.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.632
Whatever else
Mr. Frink is-- and in--

13:19.699 --> 13:21.101
in truth,
I hardly know him--

13:21.168 --> 13:23.336
he is an extraordinarily
gifted artist.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.471
Fuck.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.364
He can make anything?

13:51.431 --> 13:53.200
Anything!

13:53.266 --> 13:55.468
But only if I have
my assistant.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.357
Welcome back,
ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.126
- How was your flight?
- Fine. Thank you.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.727
You recalled
the Field Agents?

14:20.793 --> 14:22.162
Along with suspected
Resistance members

14:22.229 --> 14:23.463
from across the Neutral Zone.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.032
All are being questioned
about the whereabouts

14:25.098 --> 14:26.666
of the Man
in the High Castle.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.168
And?

14:28.235 --> 14:30.070
The StandartenfÃ¼hrers are
gathered to brief you, sir,

14:30.137 --> 14:31.972
but nothing definitive yet.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.942
And Joe Blake?

14:34.975 --> 14:36.476
No word.

14:46.753 --> 14:49.322
Well, look
what the wind blew in.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.291
Look, I'm sorry
to show up like this, sir,

14:51.358 --> 14:54.694
but...things took a little
longer than I thought.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.964
Last funeral I went to,

14:57.030 --> 14:58.698
the whole thing
lasted about an hour.

14:58.765 --> 15:00.833
You've been gone
best part of three weeks.

15:00.968 --> 15:05.172
Right. I'm sorry, sir.
I'm here now.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.874
And you expected me
to keep the forklift open?

15:07.975 --> 15:10.410
No, not expected, sir.
Hoped.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.045
Who the hell do you
think you are, Blake?

15:12.112 --> 15:14.114
I don't think
I'm anybody, sir.

15:14.181 --> 15:16.516
I just want to show up
and do an honest day's work,

15:16.583 --> 15:18.451
if you'll let me.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.255
Well, you want to grab
a sledgehammer

15:22.322 --> 15:24.824
and break concrete,
I guess that'll be okay.

15:24.891 --> 15:27.527
That honest enough
for you?

15:28.895 --> 15:30.363
Thank you, sir.

15:40.007 --> 15:42.242
The enriched uranium
will be transported

15:42.309 --> 15:43.876
to the depot in Concord,

15:44.011 --> 15:48.015
then put in canned fruit boxes
and transferred onto buses.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.449
General Onoda has asked

15:49.516 --> 15:51.118
that we generate
the relevant paperwork

15:51.184 --> 15:52.485
immediately, Trade Minister.

15:52.552 --> 15:58.658
Public buses...
carrying passengers.

16:02.295 --> 16:05.665
The project must remain hidden
from the Nazis at all costs.

16:05.732 --> 16:08.301
Radiation of civilians.

16:08.368 --> 16:12.872
Only buses carrying non-Japanese
passengers are to be used.

16:12.939 --> 16:16.043
Completely unacceptable.

16:18.045 --> 16:21.714
General Onoda was most
insistent, Trade Minister.

16:21.781 --> 16:24.084
It can wait.

16:27.587 --> 16:31.524
What of the research
I asked you to carry out?

16:40.733 --> 16:42.802
Lolita.

16:42.869 --> 16:45.072
Nelson Mandela.

16:45.072 --> 16:48.441
Cuban Missile Crisis.

16:51.078 --> 16:53.446
I could find no
reference to any of these

16:53.513 --> 16:55.348
in official records,
Trade Minister.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.822
- What happened to you?
- Is Arnold home?

17:35.888 --> 17:37.457
Where have you been?

17:37.524 --> 17:38.525
Ma, is he here?

17:38.591 --> 17:40.627
No. He got called in to work.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.131
Hello.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.299
Arnold,
I need you to come home.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.369
Is that--

17:49.436 --> 17:51.138
I thought you already left.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.772
Now, Arnold.

17:54.341 --> 17:56.876
I just got here.
What is it?

17:56.943 --> 17:59.379
It's Ma. She needs you.
It's urgent.

17:59.446 --> 18:02.382
Can you just come home
Please? Right now.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.650
I'll be right there.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.319
Juliana, you're scaring me.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.388
It's gonna be fine, Ma.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.157
I'll explain
when Arnold gets here.

18:10.157 --> 18:11.391
- We all have to leave town.
- What?

18:11.458 --> 18:12.959
I need you to start
putting some things

18:13.025 --> 18:14.327
- in a suitcase, okay?
- Today?

18:14.394 --> 18:15.828
Yes. And I need to look
at the photo albums.

18:15.895 --> 18:17.197
- Why?
- Just please.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.865
Do you still have any
of the clothes I left here?

18:24.003 --> 18:27.674
My point was he could try
to be romantic now and again.

18:27.740 --> 18:28.741
You know what he did?

18:28.808 --> 18:30.643
He sent his secretary
out to buy me a dress.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.813
Henry confuses romance
with, you know, romance.

18:35.815 --> 18:39.852
Gerry shows his affection with
a prescription for Eukodal.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.521
Although,
given the choice

18:41.588 --> 18:43.656
between Eukodal
and, you know, romance--

18:46.959 --> 18:48.261
Ladies.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.763
What am I interrupting?

18:50.830 --> 18:52.365
A spirited discussion

18:52.432 --> 18:55.067
about whether or not it's
too late to plant daffodils.

18:55.202 --> 18:56.769
What do you think?

18:56.836 --> 18:59.306
I'm going to say no,
while making a mental note

18:59.372 --> 19:02.074
how adept Mary Jane is
at covering.

19:03.210 --> 19:04.110
Sit with us, John.

19:04.211 --> 19:05.578
Tell us about Berlin.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.714
Did you meet
with the FÃ¼hrer?

19:11.584 --> 19:14.354
I'm sorry.
I have a lot of work to do.

19:14.421 --> 19:17.924
Both the Fatherland
and our FÃ¼hrer

19:17.990 --> 19:19.992
are in vigorous good health.

19:20.059 --> 19:21.328
Excuse me.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.568
I'll be right back.

19:41.248 --> 19:44.917
You don't look like a man
who was greeted like a hero.

19:47.820 --> 19:53.226
I have, um, an urgent
assignment from the FÃ¼hrer,

19:53.226 --> 19:53.260
I have, um, an urgent
assignment from the FÃ¼hrer,
one that, uh...

19:53.260 --> 19:55.828
one that, uh...

19:55.895 --> 19:58.531
one that will
be difficult to accomplish.

19:59.566 --> 20:02.235
And how is he really?

20:04.537 --> 20:10.377
Not in vigorous good health,
physically or otherwise.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.012
You're worried.

20:13.079 --> 20:14.614
He's worried.

20:15.648 --> 20:18.551
So what are you going to do?

20:19.819 --> 20:22.722
What I vowed to do
in the oath I took:

20:22.789 --> 20:26.626
give my absolute allegiance,
loyalty, and bravery

20:26.693 --> 20:27.794
until my death.

20:50.550 --> 20:53.620
Thank you for coming,
Kido Tai-i.

20:53.686 --> 20:56.323
Brevity
would be appreciated.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.990
You owe a favor

20:58.057 --> 20:59.592
in exchange for the identity

20:59.659 --> 21:01.461
of the Crown Prince's
assassin.

21:01.528 --> 21:04.163
I must ask for it now.

21:04.230 --> 21:06.198
The man you have in custody

21:06.333 --> 21:09.068
accused of this crime--
Ed McCarthy--

21:09.135 --> 21:11.338
I need you to release him.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.973
The Judicial Panel
meets later today.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.342
I have a signed confession,

21:15.408 --> 21:17.977
and the evidence
against him is compelling.

21:18.044 --> 21:20.713
Evidence has been known
to change, I believe.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.450
Once I gave you
the opportunity

21:23.516 --> 21:25.552
to eliminate
the Nazi assassin,

21:25.618 --> 21:28.355
you were free to make
your case fit anyone.

21:28.388 --> 21:31.123
Not anyone.
The Panel are not fools.

21:31.190 --> 21:32.525
Neither am I.

21:32.592 --> 21:35.428
I know the value of the
information I gave you.

21:35.495 --> 21:38.465
And yet you still have not
told me how you obtained it.

21:41.534 --> 21:44.170
If you are dealing with
the Nazis, Mr. Okamura,

21:44.236 --> 21:45.772
then you are a traitor

21:45.838 --> 21:48.608
and taking a very big
risk indeed.

21:49.776 --> 21:52.645
So you will release
McCarthy.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.526
Your hair is fine.

22:41.093 --> 22:43.830
You're about to die horribly,
but your hair is fine.

22:52.572 --> 22:53.906
Any relatives?

22:53.973 --> 22:56.776
She has a mother
that lives on Folsom.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.469
Hey, brother,
how you doing?

23:22.502 --> 23:25.171
Hi. I have something
for Frank.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.906
I'm Frank.

23:26.973 --> 23:28.541
Come in.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.579
Come in.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.215
You're Frank?

23:36.282 --> 23:38.350
What is it, brother?
Juliana?

23:38.485 --> 23:40.286
I gave her
a ride to the city.

23:40.352 --> 23:41.554
She said she couldn't
come here.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.823
Thank you, thank you. We--

23:43.890 --> 23:46.158
We've been worried about her.

23:46.225 --> 23:48.260
Do you have a message or...

23:48.327 --> 23:50.530
She wasn't sure
if you'd be here,

23:50.597 --> 23:54.601
so she,
uh, she asked me
to leave this.

24:01.708 --> 24:04.944
Did she, uh, did she say
where she was going?

24:06.245 --> 24:07.647
Sacramento.

24:09.415 --> 24:10.917
4:00 p.m.

24:15.922 --> 24:18.224
Ma, you need to pack,
please.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.559
What are you doing?

24:19.626 --> 24:21.694
We don't have
much time, okay?

24:21.761 --> 24:23.329
Juliana, please,
this is crazy!

24:23.395 --> 24:26.165
Will you please start putting
some things in a bag?

24:29.235 --> 24:31.103
What are you looking for?

24:31.170 --> 24:32.572
I saw an image of a man.

24:32.639 --> 24:33.840
Okay?
That I thought I knew.

24:33.906 --> 24:35.141
I thought I knew him.
I don't know.

24:35.207 --> 24:36.208
I thought I'd met him.

24:36.275 --> 24:37.276
I don't know where or when.

24:37.343 --> 24:38.578
What man?

24:38.645 --> 24:40.179
That's what I'm
trying to find out.

24:40.246 --> 24:41.347
Why?

24:41.413 --> 24:42.715
Because
it could be important.

24:42.782 --> 24:45.251
Why, Juliana?

25:03.002 --> 25:04.737
Who's this, Ma?

25:05.672 --> 25:06.806
Who's that?

25:09.576 --> 25:11.110
You know that picture.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.379
- Yeah, I know.
- It used to hang on the wall.

25:13.445 --> 25:15.582
That's your father.
That's Arnold.

25:15.615 --> 25:16.849
That's their army unit.

25:16.916 --> 25:19.886
I know that part, Ma,
but who is this?

25:22.589 --> 25:24.056
Why do you want
to know about him?

25:25.291 --> 25:26.593
Ma?

25:26.626 --> 25:28.595
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

25:28.595 --> 25:30.630
Asking questions!

25:30.697 --> 25:31.898
Because I need to know.

25:31.964 --> 25:33.866
Can you please
tell me who he is?

25:36.268 --> 25:37.737
Please tell me.

25:39.071 --> 25:41.240
Have you seen Trudy?

25:41.307 --> 25:42.609
Did you talk to her?

25:42.642 --> 25:44.510
Tru-- Ma,

25:44.611 --> 25:46.913
can you answer
this question, please?

25:46.979 --> 25:48.815
Why won't you tell me
who he is?

25:56.756 --> 25:58.524
His name is George Dixon.

25:58.625 --> 26:00.226
George Dixon.

26:01.628 --> 26:02.995
Okay, what--

26:03.062 --> 26:04.864
what's he got to do
with Trudy?

26:08.467 --> 26:10.336
He's her father.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.241
Ma.

26:38.530 --> 26:40.199
A pleasant surprise.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.268
Your collection
of botanical literature

26:42.334 --> 26:46.272
has grown so fine that you
no longer have need of us.

26:48.040 --> 26:52.845
Yet there remain
particular texts

26:52.912 --> 26:55.682
that you alone
have access to.

26:55.715 --> 26:58.217
The suppressed editions.

27:01.353 --> 27:05.457
Their viewing must be
approved by Tokyo.

27:05.524 --> 27:09.696
You are concerned that I will
be incited to insurrection?

27:54.741 --> 27:57.409
"Then I thought a minute
and says to myself,

27:57.476 --> 27:59.111
'Hold on.

27:59.178 --> 28:01.513
"S'pose you'd done a right
and give Jim up,

28:01.580 --> 28:04.416
"would you felt better
than what you do now?'

28:04.483 --> 28:07.253
"No, says I. 'I'd feel bad

28:07.319 --> 28:09.588
"I'd feel just the
same way I do now'.

28:09.655 --> 28:13.760
"'Well, then', says I, 'what's
the use learning to do right

28:13.826 --> 28:15.594
"when it's troublesome
to do right

28:15.661 --> 28:17.263
"and ain't no trouble
to do wrong

28:17.329 --> 28:19.766
and the wages
is just the same?'"

28:19.799 --> 28:23.903
So is Huck good or bad?

28:23.970 --> 28:27.373
Well, he's trying to be good.

28:29.108 --> 28:31.510
And that's about all
any of us can do.

28:31.577 --> 28:33.379
Even you?

28:33.445 --> 28:34.814
Yeah, even me.

28:34.881 --> 28:37.049
Ma said you went
back to work today.

28:37.116 --> 28:40.853
She said you're helping
to build the Reich,
one brick at a time.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.922
Well, when people you
care about believe in you,

28:42.989 --> 28:45.057
you try and prove them right.

28:46.558 --> 28:47.927
What about Jim?

28:47.994 --> 28:49.929
How can he be good
if he's black?

28:49.996 --> 28:52.331
They burned that
for a reason, Joe.

28:52.398 --> 28:55.134
Buddy doesn't need
to read about those people.

29:05.344 --> 29:09.248
It's almost 4:00.
She should be here by now.

29:17.123 --> 29:18.090
Come on.

29:25.497 --> 29:26.498
Excuse me, brother.

29:26.565 --> 29:28.267
Where's the Sacramento bus?

29:28.334 --> 29:30.402
Ain't no Sacramento bus
out of here.

29:30.469 --> 29:32.371
You sure?

29:32.438 --> 29:33.840
Where does it go from?

29:33.906 --> 29:35.274
Not here.

29:38.477 --> 29:39.946
The bitch set us up.

29:41.047 --> 29:42.581
What was the mother's
address?

29:42.648 --> 29:43.850
Now, look,
it's time to quit, man.

29:43.850 --> 29:45.017
She'll be long gone--

29:45.084 --> 29:46.752
Just give me
the fucking address!

29:46.853 --> 29:49.221
That woman whose body
we found last night,

29:49.288 --> 29:51.423
her name
was Karen Vecchione.

29:51.490 --> 29:52.859
Confirmed Resistance.

29:52.859 --> 29:54.793
She was married,
unofficially, to Sam Kyle,

29:54.861 --> 29:56.996
a leader in
the northern Resistance,

29:57.063 --> 29:58.297
one of those eliminated

29:58.364 --> 30:00.099
while planning
the Pacific Bank operation.

30:00.166 --> 30:03.269
Her brothers were killed in
fighting after the surrender.

30:03.335 --> 30:04.904
What else, Sergeant?

30:04.971 --> 30:06.338
During the search
of her apartment,

30:06.405 --> 30:08.140
the name Gillnitz
was discovered--

30:08.207 --> 30:10.242
the name of the Oakland man
found in Lafayette Park

30:10.309 --> 30:13.812
with his throat cut
by, uh, persons unknown,

30:13.880 --> 30:15.814
in pursuit
of the latest film.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.118
The films.

30:21.220 --> 30:22.721
Go through the files.

30:22.788 --> 30:24.323
Look for all women
connected to the films

30:24.390 --> 30:26.792
who could be a match for the
fugitive from this morning.

30:26.859 --> 30:28.127
Hai.

30:31.597 --> 30:33.199
Repeat the description.

30:35.201 --> 30:38.470
1.75 meters tall,
slim, dark hair.

30:40.772 --> 30:43.175
And call Trade Minister
Tagomi's office.

30:43.242 --> 30:48.047
Find out if Juliana Crain
has returned to her post.

30:50.749 --> 30:53.652
It was a few nights,
that's all,

30:53.719 --> 30:56.022
after your father died.

30:56.088 --> 30:58.157
They were best friends.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.060
I didn't find out
I was pregnant

31:01.127 --> 31:03.229
till after I was with Arnold.

31:03.295 --> 31:04.330
Jesus, Ma,

31:04.396 --> 31:06.532
did you plan on going
through the whole unit?

31:08.000 --> 31:10.169
We all thought
we were going to die.

31:13.739 --> 31:16.708
Did Dixon know
he had a daughter?

31:16.775 --> 31:18.810
Yeah.

31:18.945 --> 31:20.846
He didn't want to stay
here after the war.

31:20.947 --> 31:23.149
He hated the Pons.

31:23.215 --> 31:26.185
I couldn't leave.
I mean, this is my home.

31:26.252 --> 31:27.853
So he went to New York,

31:27.954 --> 31:29.321
and he promised
he'd stay away

31:29.388 --> 31:31.991
and let Arnold
be Trudy's father.

31:32.058 --> 31:33.659
Does Arnold know?

31:33.725 --> 31:36.996
No. And he can't.

31:37.063 --> 31:38.764
- Not ever.
- What about Trudy?

31:38.830 --> 31:40.032
Did she know about this?

31:42.134 --> 31:44.170
I don't know
how she found out.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.071
What?

31:45.137 --> 31:46.772
That's why she left.

31:46.838 --> 31:49.475
- Mom, what--
- Juliana, honey.

31:49.541 --> 31:50.977
Look.

31:51.978 --> 31:53.212
This is ancient history.

31:53.279 --> 31:54.981
It doesn't change anything.

31:55.047 --> 31:56.515
It changes everything.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.152
Juliana, please.

32:00.219 --> 32:01.553
Is Dixon still in the Reich?

32:01.620 --> 32:03.089
- You can't tell Arnold--
- Is he?

32:03.155 --> 32:05.624
Brooklyn, last I heard.

32:06.892 --> 32:08.860
All right,
what is the big hurry?

32:08.995 --> 32:10.396
Arnold, listen,
I have to go, okay?

32:10.462 --> 32:12.131
You leave to leave town,
both of you, right now.

32:12.198 --> 32:13.432
You need to get
out of the city.

32:13.499 --> 32:15.067
You need to go to Sacramento
and see Aunt Jean.

32:15.134 --> 32:18.170
- Why?
- Because if you don't,
you'll die.

32:18.237 --> 32:21.007
What are you talking about?

32:21.073 --> 32:22.841
I saw something.

32:22.908 --> 32:25.144
Something terrible
happened here in a film.

32:25.211 --> 32:28.347
The-- The city was destroyed
by an atomic bomb.

32:28.414 --> 32:29.481
What film?

32:29.548 --> 32:31.417
Honey, I didn't have
a chance to eat lunch.

32:31.483 --> 32:33.419
- Would you mind--
- Look, I'm staying.

32:33.485 --> 32:36.022
She doesn't understand.
Why should we?

32:36.088 --> 32:37.556
It now makes sense.

32:37.623 --> 32:40.059
Are you talking about
the Man In the High Castle?

32:40.126 --> 32:41.693
What do you know
about him?

32:43.029 --> 32:44.763
Now I know why
you're talking crazy.

32:44.830 --> 32:46.032
You know he's a lunatic.

32:47.166 --> 32:48.934
It's not true.

32:49.035 --> 32:50.569
I met him.
That isn't true.

32:50.636 --> 32:53.772
Jules, you trust me on this.
I know better than you.

32:53.839 --> 32:55.741
I've heard rumors.
He's a nut.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.077
Is that what they're
telling you at work?

32:59.778 --> 33:02.181
At the post office?

33:09.121 --> 33:11.723
The truth is
as terrible as death.

33:14.393 --> 33:17.396
We're not going anywhere.

33:20.332 --> 33:24.336
If you have to go,
we'll get you some money.

33:42.088 --> 33:43.955
- Oh, my God.
- Who are they?

33:44.090 --> 33:45.457
Please, Arnold,
stay here with Ma.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.093
- What do they want?
- You lock the door

33:47.159 --> 33:48.427
and you stay inside
till I've gone.

33:48.494 --> 33:49.795
Juliana,
listen to me.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.497
Wait a minute.
Take this. Take it.

33:51.563 --> 33:52.798
Here, take this.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.633
The tunnel connected
to the bomb shelter--

33:54.700 --> 33:56.668
can we still get to it?

33:56.735 --> 33:58.104
Yeah?

34:01.873 --> 34:03.109
I love you, Mom.

34:20.459 --> 34:22.394
Come back, you bitch!

35:05.937 --> 35:10.008
- "American Reich."
- Two cops, one big city.

35:10.075 --> 35:12.178
Seems to me
that you haven't sold
anything in months.

35:12.211 --> 35:13.245
So tell me--

35:14.946 --> 35:17.449
What are you talking about?
Why don't you just cut me in--

35:17.516 --> 35:20.419
Jimmy! No!

35:20.486 --> 35:22.354
Listen here,
this is New York City.

35:22.421 --> 35:25.191
If you got a problem
with Hitler than you
got a problem with me.

35:35.467 --> 35:36.902
Sieg heil, Joe.

35:38.570 --> 35:42.208
Sorry to disturb you.
Rita, isn't it?

35:43.209 --> 35:44.910
Don't be alarmed.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.646
Joe and I
are old colleagues.

35:51.116 --> 35:53.252
We just need a few minutes.

35:54.886 --> 35:56.622
Sweetheart, just--

36:01.360 --> 36:03.429
Can't take the idea
that decent--

36:05.897 --> 36:09.568
You haven't been picking up
your messages, Joe.

36:09.635 --> 36:12.771
I said everything
I had to say.

36:12.838 --> 36:15.741
I get it. You want to...

36:15.807 --> 36:18.544
do an honest day's work
at the construction site,

36:18.610 --> 36:22.248
come home to Rita every night,

36:22.314 --> 36:24.950
and drink a beer
in front of the TV, huh?

36:25.016 --> 36:27.353
I understand
the appeal of that.

36:27.419 --> 36:30.356
But I wonder if you
understand the cost of it.

36:30.422 --> 36:32.824
I'm not the man
you think I am.

36:34.793 --> 36:38.397
I have orders for you
from Berlin,

36:38.464 --> 36:40.932
from Reichsminister Heusmann.

36:40.999 --> 36:43.335
He wants to see you.

36:47.339 --> 36:50.976
And what makes either of you
think I want to see him?

36:51.042 --> 36:53.479
He's your father.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.180
Why now?

36:55.281 --> 36:57.048
I think that's a question
for him, don't you?

36:57.115 --> 37:00.986
That depends. Is it him
who wants me there or you?

37:04.356 --> 37:06.191
Is that what this is?

37:06.292 --> 37:09.361
You think I'd be useful
for you in Berlin?

37:10.762 --> 37:13.299
If you tell me
you don't want to go, Joe,

37:13.332 --> 37:15.834
I will countermand the order.

37:23.975 --> 37:25.677
By the way,

37:25.744 --> 37:28.647
a female Resistance
operative was shot and killed

37:28.714 --> 37:30.482
in the Pacific States
last night.

37:30.549 --> 37:33.519
We're waiting for
confirmation it was Miss Crain.

37:57.343 --> 37:59.945
I must ask you to leave,
Tagomi Tai-i.

38:02.180 --> 38:03.915
Do you know this book?

38:09.688 --> 38:13.359
That is a question,
not an accusation.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.495
What we do not understand

38:16.562 --> 38:18.364
can be frightening.

38:19.264 --> 38:21.400
Yes, it can be.

38:21.467 --> 38:26.104
But when one is troubled
by the reality of this world,

38:26.171 --> 38:27.639
it can be comforting

38:27.706 --> 38:29.941
to consider
other possibilities,

38:30.008 --> 38:34.145
even if those possibilities
disturb us,

38:34.212 --> 38:36.415
so strong is the desire

38:36.482 --> 38:38.817
to escape the tyranny
of consciousness

38:38.884 --> 38:42.153
and the narrow boundaries
of our perceptions,

38:42.220 --> 38:44.189
to unlock
the prisons of thought

38:44.255 --> 38:46.392
in which we trap ourselves,

38:46.458 --> 38:49.260
all in the hope
that a better world

38:49.395 --> 38:51.697
or a better version
of ourselves, perhaps,

38:51.763 --> 38:54.433
may lie on the other side
of the door.

39:10.716 --> 39:14.920
I have your confession
here, Mr. McCarthy,

39:14.986 --> 39:17.423
but I wanted to ensure

39:17.489 --> 39:20.426
that you fully understand
the consequences.

39:21.292 --> 39:22.994
I understand.

39:23.061 --> 39:24.963
In addition to your execution,

39:25.030 --> 39:28.667
Mr. Frink and your grandfather
will also be shot...

39:31.002 --> 39:32.871
as well as every worker
at the factory

39:32.938 --> 39:35.441
before it is burnt
to the ground.

39:35.441 --> 39:38.009
Why would you do that?

39:38.076 --> 39:40.712
Why would I not?

39:40.779 --> 39:43.281
Because you got
what you wanted.

39:43.348 --> 39:46.652
I can assure you,
Mr. McCarthy,

39:46.718 --> 39:49.888
I did not want any of this.

39:54.059 --> 39:55.494
No!

39:57.796 --> 39:58.964
No!

40:02.934 --> 40:04.536
You're a liar.

40:06.738 --> 40:09.475
You enjoy this.
You must.

40:11.877 --> 40:14.379
You beat every word
of that out of me,

40:14.446 --> 40:16.682
and I would have died
first.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.484
I would have
let you kill me

40:18.550 --> 40:20.919
if I knew you were
going to do this anyway.

40:20.986 --> 40:24.422
Then at least I would have
died with some dignity.

40:29.427 --> 40:31.362
No!

40:36.802 --> 40:40.171
You have suffered
for those you love.

40:41.673 --> 40:44.510
What I need to know now is

40:44.576 --> 40:47.913
how far are you prepared
to go for them?

41:10.802 --> 41:13.438
Okay, I'll be back
in a day or two.

41:13.539 --> 41:17.108
You've waited your whole life
to meet your father, Joe.

41:18.810 --> 41:21.847
What I have to say to him
won't take long.

41:23.549 --> 41:24.883
You don't believe me?

41:24.950 --> 41:27.919
You said you were driving
a truck for some extra cash.

41:27.986 --> 41:30.989
I wanted to protect you
and Buddy.

41:31.056 --> 41:34.893
I always knew there was
something or someone else.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.695
Right from when
we first met,

41:36.762 --> 41:38.196
you were never
really with me.

41:40.398 --> 41:42.167
Is there someone else?

41:47.405 --> 41:50.075
Don't come back
for me, Joe.

41:50.141 --> 41:54.580
If you want to see Buddy,
that's-- that's fine.

41:56.247 --> 41:58.950
But let's not pretend
it's anything else.

42:00.451 --> 42:01.920
Rita.

42:44.763 --> 42:46.898
I apologize
for calling on you here.

42:47.933 --> 42:49.735
I know it's proscribed.

42:54.139 --> 42:55.941
I'm in trouble.

42:58.343 --> 43:02.280
The Kempeitai called
my office earlier today.

43:05.651 --> 43:08.186
I have no one else
to turn to.

43:08.253 --> 43:09.855
Please give me one minute.

43:19.397 --> 43:21.399
You had faith in me once.

43:21.466 --> 43:25.036
I take full responsibility
for my mistake.

43:25.103 --> 43:27.538
Please,
I need a diplomatic visa

43:27.673 --> 43:30.341
to get out
of the Pacific States

43:30.408 --> 43:31.810
and do what I have to do.

43:33.344 --> 43:35.013
What is that?

43:37.115 --> 43:40.018
Something
that might be crazy,

43:40.085 --> 43:42.688
but if it isn't,
I can't take that risk.

43:42.688 --> 43:44.756
All I know is I have to try
to do what's right.

43:44.823 --> 43:48.694
What if by trying
you compound tragedy?

43:49.695 --> 43:51.229
Are you saying
I should do nothing?

43:54.532 --> 43:57.135
Do not rely on my judgment.

44:00.706 --> 44:04.810
I'm sorry.
I cannot help you.

44:21.459 --> 44:22.994
You didn't make a mistake.

44:31.737 --> 44:33.805
It's not safe here
in this city.

44:34.806 --> 44:36.407
You should leave.

45:08.006 --> 45:09.607
Dear Frank,

45:09.674 --> 45:11.409
I don't even know if this
letter will reach you,

45:11.476 --> 45:13.879
but if you are reading this,
I'm begging you,

45:13.945 --> 45:15.947
please get out
of the city now.

45:17.682 --> 45:18.984
You might know already

45:19.050 --> 45:20.585
that I didn't
follow the plan.

45:20.651 --> 45:22.320
Aah! Aah!

45:22.387 --> 45:23.989
Aah!

45:24.055 --> 45:25.891
But I am leaving town now.

45:27.826 --> 45:31.662
One day I hope I'll get the
chance to explain everything

45:31.797 --> 45:34.800
and that you'll understand.

45:34.833 --> 45:37.535
The guilty party
had access to firearms

45:37.602 --> 45:39.170
and strong motive:

45:39.237 --> 45:42.073
a family grievance
against the Empire.

45:42.140 --> 45:44.575
The assassin evaded
capture for too long,

45:44.642 --> 45:45.977
but, as you can see,

45:46.044 --> 45:50.281
Miss Vecchione
did not escape justice.

45:57.022 --> 45:58.857
You're the kindest,
most generous man

45:58.924 --> 46:00.491
I've ever met, Frank.

46:00.558 --> 46:02.293
I'd given up on everyone
and everything,

46:02.360 --> 46:04.229
and youput me
back on my feet.

46:04.295 --> 46:08.366
You brought me back to life
one step at a time.

46:28.519 --> 46:29.988
Frank.

46:38.596 --> 46:39.865
It's okay.

46:46.872 --> 46:48.874
I want you to know
that my feelings for you

46:48.940 --> 46:50.275
were and always
will be more real

46:50.341 --> 46:51.977
than anything
I've ever known.

46:53.879 --> 46:55.881
Whatever happens,

46:55.881 --> 46:58.984
I don't believe
our fate is inevitable.

46:59.050 --> 47:00.986
And you shouldn't, either.

47:03.321 --> 47:04.789
I don't know
if we can change it,

47:04.890 --> 47:06.457
but I believe wehave to try.

47:07.959 --> 47:09.961
You'll always
be with me, Frank,

47:10.028 --> 47:12.463
and I hope I'll
always be with you.

47:52.938 --> 47:54.039
Halt!

47:55.773 --> 47:58.509
You! Stop!

47:58.576 --> 48:01.479
Halt before we shoot!

48:01.546 --> 48:02.847
Stop!

48:02.948 --> 48:05.050
Juliana Crane!

48:07.618 --> 48:09.120
- Juliana Crane!
- Halt!

48:11.256 --> 48:12.423
Hands up!

48:12.490 --> 48:13.458
She's out prisoner!

48:17.795 --> 48:21.032
My name is Juliana Crain.
I work with Joe Blake.

48:21.099 --> 48:22.300
I need asylum.
