You're overthinking it.

01:58.885 --> 01:59.954
Okay, fine.

01:59.965 --> 02:01.478
The Leonids meteor shower.

02:02.765 --> 02:03.993
What? (laughing)

02:05.405 --> 02:09.956
- What? That's not a thing.
- Oh my God. Honey.

02:10.565 --> 02:11.714
- What is it?
- Come on.

02:11.725 --> 02:12.919
Come on, look at this.

02:15.445 --> 02:17.401
Okay, well, first of
all, it's your screensaver,

02:17.405 --> 02:19.600
which is offensive,
but also that blur

02:19.605 --> 02:22.039
is the prettiest thing
you've ever seen.

02:22.045 --> 02:23.478
It's the most beautiful thing.

02:25.325 --> 02:27.122

- Thank you.

02:27.125 --> 02:28.160
That's a little better.

02:28.165 --> 02:30.759
Ah, okay, fine.

02:31.565 --> 02:32.680
What's yours?

02:33.005 --> 02:34.916
Oh, that's easy.

02:36.045 --> 02:38.240
Sunset over the Grand Canyon.

02:38.245 --> 02:42.318
Mm. I cannot believe
I've never been there.

02:42.805 --> 02:45.194
It's the closest thing
to heaven on earth.

02:48.365 --> 02:50.083
I'd love to go there with you.

02:51.565 --> 02:52.998
I'd like that.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.198
It's Riley's school again.

03:51.645 --> 03:53.681
[Principal] Three strikes
and a week suspension.

03:53.685 --> 03:56.074
We can't have kids
skipping school.

03:56.085 --> 04:00.601
Isn't there,
(sighs) I don't know

04:00.605 --> 04:03.483
any kind of exception
for special situations?

04:03.485 --> 04:06.397
[Principal] There is nothing
harder than losing a parent,

04:06.405 --> 04:09.044
but I have given her
all the leeway I can.

04:09.125 --> 04:10.763
She's 11 years old.

04:10.765 --> 04:12.198
[Principal] It's
been nearly a year.

04:12.205 --> 04:13.923
May I remind you
that this school

04:13.925 --> 04:15.483
is partnered with a
grief counseling service?

04:15.485 --> 04:16.600
We're doing okay.

04:17.085 --> 04:18.564
[Principal] Well, she
has to be picked up.

04:18.565 --> 04:20.203
There's nothing
else you can do?

04:20.565 --> 04:21.839
[Principal] I am sorry.

04:22.325 --> 04:24.793
Isn't there someone
who can help you?

04:27.245 --> 04:30.078
(plane roaring)

04:34.845 --> 04:37.757
The airport is a
monument to science.

04:38.725 --> 04:41.797
You know, 150 years ago,
it took a man six months

04:41.805 --> 04:43.796
to travel halfway
across America.

04:43.805 --> 04:47.514
Today we have planes that
harness compressible flow,

04:47.525 --> 04:51.120
creating supersonic travel that
can put you in Poland hours

04:51.125 --> 04:53.002
after leaving Los Angeles.

04:53.165 --> 04:54.484
Isn't that interesting?

04:55.285 --> 04:57.560
Yeah. Yes.
(phone buzzing)

04:57.685 --> 04:59.755
My apology, I
have to get this.

05:01.085 --> 05:02.404
Hello, Sophie.

05:02.405 --> 05:05.283
Hi, I hate, hate
asking you this,

05:05.285 --> 05:07.321
but could you please,

05:10.805 --> 05:12.875
- Oh.
- She got suspended.

05:15.005 --> 05:17.565
I would go but I have to
work and I have court.

05:19.685 --> 05:20.834
[Hagerty] Sophie.

05:24.005 --> 05:25.757
Okay, you know what, I'll do it.

05:25.765 --> 05:26.959
No worries.

05:27.325 --> 05:28.838
You're a lifesaver.

05:58.605 --> 06:00.516
[Macias] It's only
gonna be a little longer.

06:01.125 --> 06:04.515
That's what you said in June.
He should be in jail.

06:05.085 --> 06:06.996
It's a process. It takes time.

06:08.365 --> 06:10.799
I had my entire
life stolen from me

06:10.805 --> 06:13.478
and this asshole, he gets
to what, just walk around

06:13.485 --> 06:14.998
like nothing happened?

06:16.805 --> 06:19.603

07:16.405 --> 07:18.555
You're selling your Saturn rocket?

07:20.045 --> 07:22.161
Yeah. I don't want it anymore.

07:24.325 --> 07:29.001
But, your dad gave you that
and you built it together.

07:38.365 --> 07:40.515
Hey, you know what happens

07:40.525 --> 07:43.164
if you miss too many
days of school, right?

07:44.525 --> 07:46.117
They hold you back a year.

07:47.645 --> 07:49.397
Gonna fail science anyway.

07:49.805 --> 07:51.158
Don't say that.

07:51.685 --> 07:53.641
You've never gotten worse than a B.

07:55.125 --> 07:56.399
'Cause of Dad.

08:06.885 --> 08:10.434
[Jabir] Arak. It helps to relax.

08:11.885 --> 08:13.159
Christ.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.557
- (coughs) Oh my God.
- (Jabir chuckles)

08:19.565 --> 08:22.921
Mallory reacted exactly the
same when he first tried this.

08:23.485 --> 08:25.999
Is that what you guys
would do together, drink?

08:26.005 --> 08:30.078
Drink, argue, pontificate.

08:30.445 --> 08:32.640
In my country, I had a community.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.875
You know, like physicists,
futurists, scientists.

08:34.885 --> 08:37.399
But here, there's so little of that.

08:37.925 --> 08:39.961
When I met Mal for the first time,

08:39.965 --> 08:43.958
it was as if two electrons collided.

08:44.325 --> 08:46.475
Picking up mushrooms at a supermarket.

08:47.805 --> 08:49.875
There is a science to everything.

08:49.885 --> 08:52.115
He was so excited when he came home,

08:52.485 --> 08:54.441
he wouldn't shut up about you.

08:54.605 --> 08:56.084
The physicist.

08:56.605 --> 08:57.799
Yeah.

08:58.485 --> 08:59.964

Pizza's here.

11:01.125 --> 11:02.444
Where should I put it?

11:03.285 --> 11:05.003
[Riley] Wherever.
I don't want it.

11:05.005 --> 11:06.279
[Sophie] You love pizza.

11:07.085 --> 11:08.837
[Riley] Not when we have it every day.

11:11.125 --> 11:13.923
(ball clattering)

11:14.845 --> 11:16.676
[Sophie] Let's go be with your friends.

11:18.645 --> 11:21.478
You invited them. You can go be with them.

11:24.325 --> 11:25.553
It's your birthday party.

11:25.645 --> 11:27.681
Exactly, it's my birthday.

11:27.685 --> 11:30.438
You're the last person
I wanna spend it with.

11:33.605 --> 11:35.323
(solemn music)

11:41.485 --> 11:42.884
(Sophie sobbing)

12:02.805 --> 12:06.115
Sophie, stop being
so hard on yourself.

12:06.685 --> 12:09.643
Her birthday and I fucked it up.

12:09.645 --> 12:11.636
Mm, we all make mistakes.

12:13.765 --> 12:16.325
Sometimes I get so mad I
just wanna strangle the man

12:16.325 --> 12:17.883
that did this to us.

12:20.125 --> 12:21.638
Darby Brinkley.

12:27.085 --> 12:29.440
The man who took my family from me

12:29.445 --> 12:31.356
was named Foad Sa'adi.

12:34.925 --> 12:36.199
What happened?

12:42.925 --> 12:47.316
This man Sa'adi was
a rival of my father's.

12:48.045 --> 12:52.755
He reported my family as
enemies of the government

12:53.165 --> 12:55.281
and it didn't matter that
it was bullshit and a lie,

12:55.285 --> 12:57.640
you know, the guard took my family anyway.

12:59.285 --> 13:00.718
And I was lucky.

13:01.645 --> 13:03.317
If I wasn't at school,

13:03.325 --> 13:05.202
I would've been taken too.

NET I Te ld "2

13:13.245 --> 13:15.042

13:20.165 --> 13:23.953
I still dream of saving
my family every day.

13:29.445 --> 13:31.003
Yeah.

13:35.285 --> 13:39.039
You know, for you it
doesn't have to be a dream.

13:43.885 --> 13:46.479
(gentle dramatic music)

13:54.965 --> 13:57.035
Say hello to my little friend.

13:58.445 --> 13:59.958
What is that thing?

13:59.965 --> 14:04.481
Believe it or not, this was
supposed to be a time machine.

14:06.885 --> 14:07.715
What?

14:08.125 --> 14:09.922
Yeah, I couldn't get it to work.

14:10.325 --> 14:12.793
Listen, this does something else.

14:13.485 --> 14:17.273
This machine can kill a person in the past.

14:18.365 --> 14:21.118
And I was hoping to use it on Foad

14:21.125 --> 14:23.116
to save my family one day.

14:23.485 --> 14:25.441
(foreboding music)

14:26.965 --> 14:29.877
Uh, you know, that's impossible, right?

14:30.325 --> 14:32.759
I wouldn't lie to you, Sophie.

14:33.365 --> 14:35.720
It's not powerful enough yet to save them,

14:35.725 --> 14:38.523
but it can save Mal.

14:41.325 --> 14:42.599
Jabir.

14:46.365 --> 14:49.880
Sophie, trust me, please.

14:52.485 --> 14:54.476
We can save Mal.

14:54.485 --> 14:56.840
This machine is a gun

14:56.845 --> 14:59.518
that can fire a bullet into the past.

14:59.525 --> 15:02.119
All we need is a target.

15:03.885 --> 15:05.113
10-0

15:05.685 --> 15:07.915
There are six men living in Los Angeles

15:07.925 --> 15:09.483
with the name Darby Brinkley.

15:09.485 --> 15:13.160
I just wanna know which
one is the driver, okay?

15:14.605 --> 15:18.234
Mal is dead. It's impossible.

15:18.245 --> 15:22.204
So what harm is there in trying?

15:23.925 --> 15:26.758

15:34.925 --> 15:36.074

17:32.045 --> 17:33.842
Have yourself a great night.

17:46.045 --> 17:49.355
[Kara] Darby? What are you doing here?

17:49.885 --> 17:51.079
[Darby] It's my home.

17:51.085 --> 17:52.040
You're drunk.

17:52.045 --> 17:53.717
[Darby] I'm allowed to see my family.

17:53.965 --> 17:55.080
[Kara] I will call the police, you know that.

17:55.085 --> 17:56.234
[Darby] Oh yeah, call, call them.

17:56.245 --> 17:57.075
It's my fucking house.

17:57.085 --> 17:58.404
[Kara] I'm not doing this with you tonight.

17:58.405 --> 17:59.633
- Oh, it's my-
- Not tonight.

17:59.645 --> 18:01.283
[Darby] I pay the fucking mortgage.

18:01.285 --> 18:02.400
NTR ET =X

18:03.645 --> 18:06.205
I pay the mortgage. Bitch!

18:06.325 --> 18:08.520
- Stop.
- Kara, let me in!

18:08.525 --> 18:10.038
Kara, for fuck's sake!

18:10.125 --> 18:11.353
(fist banging)

18:11.525 --> 18:12.640
Kara, come on!

18:12.645 --> 18:15.113
(dogs barking)

18:33.365 --> 18:35.879
(electricity buzzing)

18:36.085 --> 18:39.077
[Jabir] Do you know what
a particle accelerator is?

18:39.085 --> 18:41.440
- No.
- No. Okay.

18:41.565 --> 18:43.874
Uh, this is kind of like that.

18:44.285 --> 18:47.083
The particle accelerator speeds up

18:47.085 --> 18:50.680
a subatomic particle
into almost light speed.

18:50.685 --> 18:53.279
And this machine does that

18:53.645 --> 18:55.237
to abstract particles.

18:58.685 --> 19:00.004
Jabir, how?

19:00.005 --> 19:01.723
That's a good question.

19:01.725 --> 19:06.401
An abstract particle is
a mathematical function

19:06.405 --> 19:09.203
that can affect the
sub-atomic world.

19:09.525 --> 19:13.154
This machine sends (blows)

19:13.165 --> 19:14.359
an abstract particle

19:14.365 --> 19:17.801
into a specific point
of space-time, okay?

19:17.805 --> 19:20.842
And that particle causes

19:20.845 --> 19:23.405
a series of quantum reactions

19:23.765 --> 19:26.598
resulting in a burst of energy.

19:26.605 --> 19:29.199
And if that burst of energy

19:29.205 --> 19:31.844
is in a person's head.

19:33.085 --> 19:34.484

19:34.485 --> 19:36.635

19:36.645 --> 19:38.363
That thing's ready.

19:40.525 --> 19:43.437
Would you? Thank you so much.

19:43.445 --> 19:45.959
First we have to find him.

19:46.645 --> 19:47.873
(lights thud)

19:55.285 --> 19:57.003
Now we find him.

19:58.885 --> 20:03.834
We need a photograph with a
clearly identifiable location.

20:03.845 --> 20:05.164
That one.

20:06.965 --> 20:08.603
No, that is too old.

20:08.605 --> 20:09.560
The further back in time,

20:09.565 --> 20:11.999
the more power the engine requires.

20:12.485 --> 20:13.679
This one.

20:13.685 --> 20:17.883
So here he is at his company retreat.

20:18.725 --> 20:21.080
I will extract the metadata,

20:21.085 --> 20:23.838
find the GPS coordinates,

20:23.845 --> 20:28.521
and calculate Darby's distance from the cabin.

20:29.925 --> 20:31.438
Let's go over there.

20:32.205 --> 20:34.480
(suspenseful music)

20:42.565 --> 20:44.556
When I press enter,

20:44.965 --> 20:47.923
the processor will run a series of calculations

20:47.925 --> 20:52.077
to determine his exact location in space-time.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.635
And then the dome, that thing over there,

20:54.645 --> 20:57.398
- will generate waves.
- And Mal will be alive.

20:57.405 --> 21:00.158
And Darby will be dead.

21:01.525 --> 21:02.924
If it works.

21:05.925 --> 21:06.994
Sophie,

21:09.525 --> 21:11.163
there is no undo button.

21:12.205 --> 21:13.718
You're killing a person.

21:15.805 --> 21:17.443
We cannot take that back.

21:18.245 --> 21:19.678
He killed Mal.

21:22.885 --> 21:24.113
Is there a problem?

21:24.125 --> 21:27.834
No, no, I just put so
many years of my life

21:27.845 --> 21:29.836
- into this machine.
- Okay.

21:29.845 --> 21:31.244
And now we are going to use it.

21:31.245 --> 21:32.564
And you never tested it?

21:32.565 --> 21:35.079
I never tested it because I didn't have to,

21:35.085 --> 21:39.124
but all my calculations show it will work.

21:39.125 --> 21:42.561
Well, we're gonna find out.

21:43.765 --> 21:46.518

22:10.125 --> 22:11.353

22:12.405 --> 22:13.554
It's done.

What do you mean it's done?

22:15.685 --> 22:17.676

22:17.685 --> 22:19.004
It means it's done.

22:19.445 --> 22:21.595

22:21.605 --> 22:22.674

22:23.925 --> 22:26.803

22:26.805 --> 22:29.000

22:35.445 --> 22:37.561
but there's an explanation for this.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.715
Yeah. I'm an idiot.

22:43.445 --> 22:44.958

22:48.525 --> 22:50.163

- Just stop it.

22:51.285 --> 22:52.320

Hey!

dreamt to being an inventor.

34:06.285 --> 34:07.877
[Sophie] Obviously.

34:08.085 --> 34:09.996
I dreamt of
building flying cars

34:10.005 --> 34:12.963
and rockets to outer space.

34:12.965 --> 34:15.320
I know, you promised me
a hover board, remember?

34:32.525 --> 34:34.356

didn't matter at all.

34:43.845 --> 34:45.756

what I'm talking about.

34:50.085 --> 34:50.995

34:52.085 --> 34:55.316
Okay, what are you? What is it?

34:59.845 --> 35:01.563
Okay, so.

35:10.045 --> 35:11.763
About three years ago,

35:13.165 --> 35:18.444
Jabir approached me for an
idea for a time machine.

35:23.605 --> 35:25.243
I know it sounds stupid as fuck.

35:25.245 --> 35:26.280
- No, I'm listening.
- Listen.

35:26.285 --> 35:27.354
[Sophie] I'm listening.

35:28.765 --> 35:29.993
Okay, well.

35:32.885 --> 35:35.035
It just made me feel so alive.

35:35.765 --> 35:37.164
Just the idea.

35:38.405 --> 35:39.633
So we started building it

35:39.645 --> 35:41.363
and the more that we
started working on it,

35:41.365 --> 35:42.241
the more we realized

35:42.245 --> 35:43.917
that this thing would actually
never be a time machine,

35:43.925 --> 35:46.883
but it could be something.

35:46.885 --> 35:48.682
Why are you telling me this?

35:53.325 --> 35:54.519
I was embarrassed.

35:55.845 --> 35:57.961
I've been working on this
thing for three years

35:58.645 --> 36:01.796
and you've just
been so nice to me.

36:01.805 --> 36:05.798
And I just think that there
should be no secrets between us.

36:06.445 --> 36:08.197
I know about the machine.

36:11.405 --> 36:12.633
Jabir told me.

36:12.645 --> 36:15.079
- But why?
- I got thirty touches jugg-

36:15.085 --> 36:16.518
Riley, not now.

36:18.565 --> 36:19.884
Are you guys okay?

36:20.405 --> 36:21.554
Can you go play in your room

36:21.565 --> 36:22.680
and we'll talk at dinner.

36:28.485 --> 36:29.759
Okay.

36:34.445 --> 36:36.436
Why would Jabir tell
you about the machine?

36:40.525 --> 36:42.277
Why would he say
something to you?

36:46.485 --> 36:48.999
Because he wanted to help me.

36:51.085 --> 36:52.564
Help you how?

36:59.205 --> 37:03.118
You were killed
by a drunk driver

37:05.485 --> 37:09.717
and we, and we killed him.

37:12.165 --> 37:13.564
(Sophie sighs)

37:29.285 --> 37:30.877
Please say something.

37:33.845 --> 37:36.837
It was the longest
eight months of my life.

37:40.605 --> 37:42.960
I didn't know what I
was gonna do. (crying)

37:44.005 --> 37:45.996
Our daughter was unrecognizable

37:46.005 --> 37:49.634
and, oh my God, she,

37:50.325 --> 37:51.804
she quit everything.

37:52.325 --> 37:54.281
She quit her rocket club

37:55.245 --> 37:56.803
and she barely spoke to me.

37:56.805 --> 37:59.399
I was drowning. We both were.

38:03.285 --> 38:04.638
(Sophie sobbing)

38:12.045 --> 38:13.239
[Mal] You saved me.

38:14.165 --> 38:16.963
It just wasn't our
family without you.

38:18.205 --> 38:19.718
(somber music)

38:25.525 --> 38:27.993
(gentle dramatic music)

38:50.285 --> 38:51.513
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

38:51.525 --> 38:52.640
What are you doing?

38:55.045 --> 38:59.243
Uh, we are, uh.

39:00.605 --> 39:04.598
There is this man,
Yacqub Adabi, okay?

39:04.605 --> 39:08.280
This guy drove his
car into a crowd

39:08.285 --> 39:12.642
and he murdered three
people, maimed 17 others.

39:13.405 --> 39:14.758
We can save them.

39:16.245 --> 39:17.075
We saved Mal.

39:17.085 --> 39:18.723
Why do we have to
kill someone else?

39:18.725 --> 39:20.443
A radical terrorist.

39:21.165 --> 39:23.201
Whoever he is,
we're Killing him.

39:23.205 --> 39:25.275
Maybe it's not
about who we Kill.

39:25.285 --> 39:26.957
Maybe it's about who we save.

39:28.285 --> 39:31.118
So it's one bad life
for three good ones.

39:31.125 --> 39:32.319
Now, of course, we don't know

39:32.325 --> 39:33.758
if these lives are good lives.

39:33.765 --> 39:36.199
We do know that
Mal, there are kids.

39:36.405 --> 39:38.157
All kids are worth saving.

39:38.165 --> 39:39.883
It's way more
complicated than that.

39:39.885 --> 39:41.876
And that's exactly why we're
having this conversation.

39:41.885 --> 39:44.115
No, it screws
with your memory.

39:45.845 --> 39:46.800
What do you mean?

39:47.325 --> 39:49.634
It's akin to the
quantum theory.

39:49.645 --> 39:52.637
The observer determines
the reality, right?

39:52.965 --> 39:54.398
So we, being in this room,

39:54.405 --> 39:58.478
using this machine, makes
us observers to the change

39:58.485 --> 40:00.157
- to the timeline.
- We used the machine.

40:00.165 --> 40:03.123
So we remember the world

40:03.125 --> 40:06.242
like it was not the
new one we created.

40:07.325 --> 40:08.041
Are you telling me

40:08.045 --> 40:09.603
you don't remember
the last eight months?

40:10.365 --> 40:11.718
No, I- I do.

40:11.725 --> 40:13.875
I just, I remember a
different eight months.

40:13.885 --> 40:17.639
I remember the eight
months where I lost you.

40:17.645 --> 40:20.842
I remember coming home
and telling Riley.

40:21.085 --> 40:23.121
I remember, when
I closed my eyes,

40:23.125 --> 40:25.002
I could see your body.

40:25.805 --> 40:27.875
I'm here now and I'm
not going anywhere.

40:34.845 --> 40:37.359
Uh, so don't you guys

40:37.365 --> 40:41.153
want to spare
someone that grief?

40:42.845 --> 40:46.281
Two boys and a mother of three
were killed in this attack.

40:46.925 --> 40:48.153
We can save them.

40:49.045 --> 40:53.004
Sophie, save their parents,
their children, their husband,

40:53.005 --> 40:56.077
their wives from all the
pains and the suffering,

40:56.445 --> 40:58.322
from everything
we've been through.

40:59.245 --> 41:02.840
We have this power. Why
shouldn't we use it?

41:04.005 --> 41:05.040
IRI MIE] 4A

41:05.045 --> 41:08.355
We saved Mal and now I
work in the hospice unit

41:08.365 --> 41:09.639
and not long-term care.

41:09.645 --> 41:13.479
I don't remember my patients
and the ones I do know,

41:14.085 --> 41:15.279
they don't know who I am.

41:15.285 --> 41:16.479
That's 'cause of me.

41:16.485 --> 41:18.874
We switched your schedule to
make picking up Riley easier.

41:18.885 --> 41:21.353
Okay, the small changes
to the house, the furniture.

41:21.365 --> 41:22.559
IIo N11 =]

41:23.645 --> 41:24.839
The real question is,

41:24.845 --> 41:28.121
are there any changes that
cannot be tied back to me?

41:28.125 --> 41:29.319
Or Darby?

41:32.365 --> 41:33.320
Who's that?

41:35.605 --> 41:38.119
Mal, he's the drunk
driver who, who.

41:48.805 --> 41:50.557
(doorbell buzzes)

41:51.005 --> 41:52.563
You guys left me.

41:52.565 --> 41:54.840
Oh my gosh, it's already dark.

41:55.365 --> 41:56.923
Sorry, you must be starving.

41:56.925 --> 41:59.564
Well, good things come
to those who wait.

41:59.565 --> 42:00.475
What do you want?

42:01.085 --> 42:03.394
Hm? Chicken nuggets.

42:04.005 --> 42:05.358
I'll see what I can do.

42:06.125 --> 42:07.763
- Race you home?
- Sure.

42:07.765 --> 42:09.562
- Wait! No!
- (Mal laughs)

42:10.045 --> 42:13.003
[Mal] Oh, oh, wait,
wait, you're too fast.

42:13.765 --> 42:14.515
Slow down.

42:14.525 --> 42:16.516
You think I'm selfish
that I don't wanna use it,

42:16.525 --> 42:17.753
but I'm not.

42:18.525 --> 42:19.799
I'm scared.

42:21.685 --> 42:22.913
You can be both.

42:24.805 --> 42:26.602
(gentle dramatic music)

42:28.085 --> 42:29.484
(LTT IVI)

42:53.885 --> 42:55.876
(gentle dramatic
music continues)

42:57.045 --> 42:58.876
(siren wailing)

43:25.085 --> 43:27.553
(gentle dramatic
music continues)

43:54.885 --> 43:57.445
(gentle dramatic
music continues)

44:06.765 --> 44:08.676
(birds chirping)

44:28.805 --> 44:30.602
I'm sorry, what did, what
did you say the name was?

44:30.885 --> 44:32.921
Brinkley. Kara Brinkley.

44:34.445 --> 44:35.764
She used to live here?

44:36.285 --> 44:37.798
Yeah, no, I don't.

44:37.805 --> 44:39.318
Sorry, I don't know who that is.

44:41.885 --> 44:43.443
Who did you buy
the house from?

44:45.005 --> 44:46.404
I bought the, the
house from the bank.

44:46.405 --> 44:48.316
It was a foreclosure. So.

44:49.645 --> 44:51.681
CII aiid glg]e))

44:56.045 --> 44:57.160
Yo, you ever hear,

44:57.165 --> 44:58.644
if it ain't broke, don't fix it?

44:58.645 --> 45:01.637
Yeah, there's always room
for improvement, brother.

45:07.685 --> 45:10.074
Come on. (grunts)

45:10.645 --> 45:11.555
- Let me.
- No, man,

45:11.565 --> 45:12.714
I got it, I got it.

45:13.845 --> 45:15.836
OY TAIT d

45:16.645 --> 45:19.034
Here. Done.

45:20.245 --> 45:21.314
You okay?

45:21.605 --> 45:23.163
(water splashing)

45:29.205 --> 45:30.240
Mal.

45:32.365 --> 45:36.643
Why did we build this machine
if we are not going to use it?

45:40.405 --> 45:44.364
I never said that
we're not gonna use it.

45:47.445 --> 45:51.597
Okay, we are sitting on
this incredible creation.

45:51.605 --> 45:54.165
Something no one
has built before.

45:54.165 --> 45:55.075
Something that-

45:55.085 --> 45:56.837
That has the ability
to change the world.

45:56.845 --> 45:58.483
You don't have to
tell me, Jabir.

45:58.485 --> 45:59.713
I know this.

46:04.365 --> 46:08.995
It was so much easier
when it was theory,

46:10.365 --> 46:13.163
when it was just you and
me spitballing ideas.

46:14.165 --> 46:15.393
Mm-hmm.

46:17.405 --> 46:21.034
Maybe it's because we
did it over baklava.

46:21.925 --> 46:22.960
- Maybe.
- Huh?

46:22.965 --> 46:25.433
Everything is easier
over baklava my friend.

46:26.845 --> 46:28.801
There might be some
truth to that, Jabir.

46:32.325 --> 46:33.724
We're gonna figure this out.

46:35.165 --> 46:36.154
It's gonna take some time,

46:36.165 --> 46:37.484
but we're gonna figure it out.

46:38.925 --> 46:40.119
It's our fault.

46:41.165 --> 46:43.235
That seems overly simplistic.

46:43.245 --> 46:46.521
A woman went bankrupt
because we used the machine.

46:46.525 --> 46:49.597
Or she may have been
going bankrupt anyway,

46:50.005 --> 46:52.678
and all we did was
increase the speed of the-

46:52.685 --> 46:53.959
I don't know about
that theory, Jabir.

46:53.965 --> 46:56.843
Now listen, whatever
happened, if we were held.

46:59.965 --> 47:02.763
If we were held responsible
for the byproduct

47:02.765 --> 47:06.360
of every choice we made,
we'd all be in jail.

47:06.365 --> 47:07.798
You just don't care.

47:08.045 --> 47:09.524
I do care, Sophie.

47:10.085 --> 47:12.997
I told you there's
no undo button.

47:14.685 --> 47:17.199
Well, I wanna do something.

47:17.205 --> 47:19.241
Hey, you saved my life.

47:19.725 --> 47:21.238
You saved our family.
Don't forget that.

47:21.245 --> 47:24.203
No, I- I don't, and I
wouldn't trade you for anything,

47:24.205 --> 47:25.684
JI I eT

47:25.685 --> 47:28.882
We hurt an innocent woman
and I can't let it go.

47:32.805 --> 47:34.602
(solemn music)

47:36.125 --> 47:38.002
(gentle dramatic music)

48:05.805 --> 48:08.273
(gentle dramatic
music continues)

48:22.805 --> 48:24.033
(ominous music)

48:50.725 --> 48:52.841
(ominous music continues)

48:58.405 --> 49:00.282
All right, guys, here we go.

49:02.285 --> 49:03.081
[Diner] Thanks.

49:03.645 --> 49:06.284
And I will be back to check
on you in just a bit, okay?

49:09.845 --> 49:11.324
Hey, here you go.

49:16.285 --> 49:17.195
Ready?

49:18.805 --> 49:19.954
Kara?

49:20.765 --> 49:22.562
That's, uh, what it says.

49:23.325 --> 49:24.314
It's Sophie.

49:25.125 --> 49:26.797
I'm an old friend of Darby's.

49:38.565 --> 49:40.317
- Mine's a baseball nut.
- Mm.

49:41.045 --> 49:42.558
She's obsessed with, um.

49:43.805 --> 49:45.284
Ah, God, what's his name?

49:46.205 --> 49:47.320
The guy with the chin.

49:48.125 --> 49:49.558
- Kershaw?
- Kershaw.

49:49.565 --> 49:51.476
Yeah. You know baseball.

49:51.485 --> 49:53.043
That's why you and
Darby were friends.

49:53.325 --> 49:54.235
Yeah.

49:56.365 --> 49:57.434
He used to take Aggie

49:57.445 --> 50:01.916
to at least two games a month.

50:03.925 --> 50:06.439
Wow, that's
really sweet of him.

50:07.605 --> 50:10.756
She wasn't even his. My ex's.

50:12.405 --> 50:13.474
Didn't matter.

50:14.645 --> 50:16.283
Darby was just that kinda guy.

50:19.925 --> 50:21.881
How are you doing
with everything?

50:22.405 --> 50:24.919
It must be so hard
on you and Aggie.

50:29.005 --> 50:30.597
When was the last
time you saw him?

50:31.565 --> 50:34.159
Uh, I can't remember exactly.

50:34.165 --> 50:36.838
We were pretty drunk.

50:36.845 --> 50:39.200
I CARLA
- Yeah.

50:39.365 --> 50:42.482
Mm, Darby barely ever drank.

50:45.045 --> 50:46.239
But when he did.

50:47.005 --> 50:51.044
Maybe. High school,
you know, people change.

50:52.765 --> 50:55.598
He wasn't a saint,
or anything. So.

50:59.525 --> 51:00.924
(phone line ringing)

51:01.485 --> 51:03.715
(suspenseful music)

51:07.085 --> 51:08.643
(machine whirring)

51:16.805 --> 51:18.557
(phone line ringing)

51:23.045 --> 51:26.162
So she leaps up and traps
the ball with her chest, right?

51:26.165 --> 51:26.836
Yeah. Yes, yes.

51:26.845 --> 51:27.880
Like it drops
right at her feet.

51:27.885 --> 51:28.715
Right.

51:28.725 --> 51:31.000
She cuts around the
first offender, and whoosh!

51:31.005 --> 51:32.677
- All right, don't split the pole.
- Bread and butter.

51:32.685 --> 51:33.720
IVY

51:34.245 --> 51:36.122
(suspenseful music continues)

51:39.525 --> 51:40.799
- The goalie charges out.
- Okay.

51:40.805 --> 51:42.523
She taps it with
her left foot.

51:42.525 --> 51:44.481
- Goal!
- Goal! Come on! (laughs)

51:44.885 --> 51:46.364
I love it. I love it, I love it.

51:46.365 --> 51:47.593
Oh, check it out.

51:52.565 --> 51:54.283
(suspenseful music continues)

52:07.765 --> 52:09.642
(dramatic music)

52:21.765 --> 52:22.880
Yes.

52:27.605 --> 52:28.958
Yes!

52:48.325 --> 52:49.678
(Sophie sighs)

53:15.605 --> 53:18.563
Hey, Kara, it's Sophie
from the other night.

53:18.965 --> 53:21.604
[Announcer] But classical
physics and common sense

53:21.605 --> 53:25.598
dictated that the energy
of the. (speaks faintly)

53:25.765 --> 53:27.198
Ra:
- Hey.

53:27.565 --> 53:29.795
What did I say about using
your phone while we're eating?

53:29.805 --> 53:31.636
- We're watching TV.
- We are watching TV.

53:31.645 --> 53:33.397
This is a family activity, kiddo.

53:34.245 --> 53:35.041
Uh, can I?

53:35.045 --> 53:36.194
There's chicken in the kitchen.

53:36.205 --> 53:39.083
- Talk to you outside first?
- Yeah.

53:45.045 --> 53:48.879
I invited Kara Brinkley for
dinner on Wednesday night.

53:50.605 --> 53:52.277
Why would, why'd you do that?

53:52.285 --> 53:54.799
Because I know what it's
like to lose your husband.

54:07.965 --> 54:09.762
It's like one of
those math problems

54:09.765 --> 54:12.598
that you just can't
stop trying to solve.

54:12.605 --> 54:15.483
How do we use what we created
but without the moral cost?

54:15.845 --> 54:16.561
[Jabir] Mm-hmm.

54:16.565 --> 54:19.682
So this woman that I
went to grad school with,

54:20.645 --> 54:23.079
she's an editor at
Science Academy, but-

54:23.085 --> 54:25.883
It's not seriously
thinking of calling her?

54:25.885 --> 54:28.399
I'm just going to float some
theories out there, right?

54:32.085 --> 54:34.474
that's something that they
would be interested in.

54:35.525 --> 54:38.323
But we are speaking
hypothetically, aren't we?

54:40.085 --> 54:40.915
- Totally.
- Yeah.

54:40.925 --> 54:41.596
Yeah.

54:44.085 --> 54:45.484
Nah bro, I called, dude.

54:46.485 --> 54:47.474
- Mal, what?
- Okay.

54:47.485 --> 54:48.838
Okay, I need you
just to listen to me.

54:48.845 --> 54:49.960
- Mal!
- I'm not going to talk

54:49.965 --> 54:50.875
- about the machine.
- No, listen, what?

54:50.965 --> 54:51.795
Okay? I'm going to...

54:51.805 --> 54:53.124
- What the hell were you thinking.
- talk about the science.

54:53.125 --> 54:53.841
No, listen to me.

54:53.845 --> 54:55.358
- The science, dude.
- When this woman calls-

54:55.365 --> 54:56.844
- The science!
- You cannot.

54:56.845 --> 54:57.994
- We sent-
- Oh my God.

54:58.005 --> 55:00.121
An abstract
particle through time.

55:00.125 --> 55:01.717
And we did it without CERN.

55:03.365 --> 55:04.957
We did it without
a government grant.

55:06.925 --> 55:11.316
We did something that no
one has ever done before

55:11.325 --> 55:13.475
and we did it in your
spare bedroom, Jabir.

55:15.045 --> 55:16.717
That's, that's like a miracle.

55:17.205 --> 55:18.957
Okay? And it's huge.

55:18.965 --> 55:21.354
And that has scientific
value beyond ki...

55:23.765 --> 55:27.394
This is a breakthrough
that can literally redefine

55:27.405 --> 55:30.442
our very understanding
of quantum physics.

55:31.485 --> 55:32.964
Okay, if you wanna
change the world,

55:32.965 --> 55:34.762
like I know you wanna
change the world.

55:34.765 --> 55:36.323
I wanna change the world.

55:38.245 --> 55:39.837
We do it as scientists.

55:42.885 --> 55:44.079
So when do we eat?

55:44.085 --> 55:46.519
Aggie. Uh, manners, please.

55:46.525 --> 55:48.004
What? I'm hungry.

55:50.845 --> 55:52.676
This looks amazing.

55:52.685 --> 55:55.119
- Uh, homemade, so.
- Really?

55:55.125 --> 55:55.875
- Yes.
- No.

55:55.885 --> 55:57.204
Uh, thank you. It is.

55:57.205 --> 55:58.081
Thank you for having us.

55:58.085 --> 55:59.677
Oh. Hi, honey.

55:59.685 --> 56:02.358
aE)
- Hi, uh, Kara Brinkley.

56:02.365 --> 56:04.720
Nice to meet you.
This is my daughter, Aggie.

56:10.805 --> 56:13.319
Hey! Why didn't you tell me?

56:14.045 --> 56:15.637
"Cause you wouldn't have come.

56:15.725 --> 56:17.716
Of course. We killed her husband.

56:17.725 --> 56:19.044
I know that.

56:19.325 --> 56:20.917
That's why I invited her.

56:21.965 --> 56:23.034
When I lost Mal,

56:23.045 --> 56:26.003
I felt like 1- I
fell into quicksand

56:26.005 --> 56:29.441
and I just kept getting
sucked deeper and deeper.

56:29.445 --> 56:31.356
I couldn't have done it without you.

56:31.365 --> 56:32.923
Sophie, that is totally different.

56:32.925 --> 56:35.234
- No.
- Mal was my best friend.

56:35.245 --> 56:37.201
I would do anything for Mal.

56:37.205 --> 56:39.924
Look, Jabir, you are our lifeline.

56:46.245 --> 56:47.678
I'm gonna sit next to you.

56:47.685 --> 56:51.997
Actually, your mom wants
you to sit next to Aggie.

56:52.005 --> 56:53.597
- Do I have to?
- Yes.

57:00.085 --> 57:02.076
My mom made me sit here.

57:02.085 --> 57:03.723
Blackmail or bribe?

57:04.165 --> 57:06.235
- What?
- How's she making you?

57:07.285 --> 57:08.684
Kara bribes me.

57:09.165 --> 57:11.759
Come here tonight, then I
can watch Dodgers tomorrow.

57:18.605 --> 57:20.880
[Kara] You really didn't
have to do all this.

57:20.885 --> 57:22.716
Oh, it was our pleasure.

57:22.725 --> 57:24.317
[Kara] It looks delicious.

57:25.125 --> 57:26.319
[Sophie] Well, Mal's
the one with the skills

57:26.325 --> 57:27.235
in the kitchen.

57:27.245 --> 57:28.598
[Mal] Mm, it
was a team effort.

57:29.165 --> 57:30.200
ERY
- (Kara laughs)

57:30.205 --> 57:31.797
(Sophie laughs)
- No.

57:33.365 --> 57:35.595
Well, thank you.
I know how hard it can be.

57:37.365 --> 57:39.640
So, have you always
worked in restaurants?

57:40.245 --> 57:43.476
Oh, well, I wouldn't call
the Star Diner a restaurant.

57:43.485 --> 57:45.123
What were you doing there?

57:45.445 --> 57:46.560
That was so random.

57:46.565 --> 57:49.238
Just running into you there,
of all places.

57:49.605 --> 57:52.915
Hmm. I know, it was so random.

57:52.925 --> 57:56.474
Um. I just wanted
a cup of coffee.

57:57.405 --> 57:58.804
What were you doing in Bell?

57:59.325 --> 58:00.201
lal

58:00.925 --> 58:04.440
Uh, they have the best bakeries in Bell.

58:05.365 --> 58:07.003
- Do they?
- Yes, they do.

58:07.005 --> 58:08.563
Never been in Del Bosque's?

58:09.165 --> 58:10.564
No? You should.

58:11.325 --> 58:13.202
I go every time I'm around.

58:14.365 --> 58:15.923
Yeah, no, I've never been.

58:15.925 --> 58:18.883
But I- I really like to
make my own desert, so.

58:18.885 --> 58:20.204
Yeah, I can tell.

58:20.445 --> 58:22.003
You really cook with one arm?

58:22.085 --> 58:23.200
Agatha!

58:23.285 --> 58:24.240
ETE

58:25.045 --> 58:26.080
NET I Te ld "2

58:26.085 --> 58:28.201
Uh, she definitely knows better.

58:28.885 --> 58:30.204
It's okay, really.

58:30.205 --> 58:31.433
You get used to it.

58:32.165 --> 58:33.996
So you wanna know how
I cook with one arm?

58:35.285 --> 58:38.516
Very slowly and very carefully.

58:39.205 --> 58:40.718
My dad's the best.

58:42.685 --> 58:43.834
What happened to your arm?

58:44.445 --> 58:48.199
Riley, did you tell Aggie
about your rocket club?

58:49.205 --> 58:51.765
They're, they're competing
in the section champion-

58:51.765 --> 58:52.914
I can tell her.

58:53.645 --> 58:56.637
Uh, I used to work for Lockheed

58:57.245 --> 58:59.475
and we were testing the engine

58:59.485 --> 59:04.161
for the F-22 Raptor
and it was a beautiful,

59:04.165 --> 59:05.598
sleek piece of engineering.

59:05.605 --> 59:06.799
Everybody was very
excited about it,

59:06.805 --> 59:10.081
including Danny
Albert, who was, uh,

59:11.445 --> 59:13.675
JI E-TIRe [[e) SN {F-10Te 14 ES)

59:14.165 --> 59:17.362
because he forgot to tighten
the strap on the fuel tank.

59:17.445 --> 59:21.643
And I was, uh, (clears throat)

59:22.965 --> 59:25.399
I was underneath it when
it came crashing down.

59:26.525 --> 59:28.117
Oh my God.

59:28.125 --> 59:30.593
I was in and out
of the hospitals.

59:33.925 --> 59:36.439
Doctors said that there wasn't
much that they could do, so.

59:36.445 --> 59:38.163
Well that doesn't surprise me.

59:38.165 --> 59:39.200
Well, the silver lining is

59:39.205 --> 59:42.322
that Riley got to grow up
with her dad around a lot.

59:42.845 --> 59:44.244
(Sophie chuckles)

59:49.005 --> 59:50.154
Wanna hear a secret?

59:50.165 --> 59:51.041
Is that a trick question?

59:51.045 --> 59:52.478
(Kara and Sophie laugh)

59:52.885 --> 59:54.284
I'm a cripple too.

59:55.645 --> 59:58.478
Oh, Aggie, don't,
don't say that, sweetie.

59:58.485 --> 59:59.679
It's true. I have MS.

59:59.685 --> 01:00:01.994
You can still do
everything other kids do.

01:00:02.005 --> 01:00:03.154
For now.

01:00:03.165 --> 01:00:04.883
Aggie, please.

01:00:06.125 --> 01:00:07.399
[Aggie] We lost our
house 'cause of me.

01:00:07.405 --> 01:00:10.283
No, no, we lost our house

01:00:10.285 --> 01:00:11.638
because of doctors
and hospitals.

01:00:11.645 --> 01:00:14.239
And we only had to go to
those doctors 'cause of me.

01:00:17.925 --> 01:00:18.994
(Kara sighs)

01:00:21.725 --> 01:00:23.477
(insects chirping)

01:00:26.965 --> 01:00:28.842
Well, thank you again
for having us over.

01:00:28.845 --> 01:00:32.360
It was really kind
of you and I just.

01:00:33.245 --> 01:00:34.473
- Kara!
- I'm so sorry.

01:00:35.805 --> 01:00:38.080
Give me just one
second, babe, okay?

01:00:45.405 --> 01:00:46.633
(footsteps thud)

01:00:47.445 --> 01:00:50.084
Didn't your mom ever teach
you not to sneak up on people?

01:00:50.725 --> 01:00:51.555
No.

01:00:52.325 --> 01:00:53.678
Well, don't.

01:00:55.525 --> 01:00:57.481
Is she still gonna let
you watch the game tomorrow?

01:00:58.125 --> 01:00:59.114
Why wouldn't she?

01:00:59.245 --> 01:01:00.963
I didn't do anything wrong.

01:01:00.965 --> 01:01:02.444
Well, if she won't,

01:01:02.445 --> 01:01:04.720
maybe I can stream it to you.

01:01:07.965 --> 01:01:08.920
Cool.

01:01:11.605 --> 01:01:13.277
(water splashing)

01:01:14.245 --> 01:01:15.883
(dishes clattering)

01:01:26.925 --> 01:01:31.521
AAA To = VW {VIR (YET Te)
to lose those you love.

01:01:33.725 --> 01:01:34.999
We owe her.

01:01:36.805 --> 01:01:38.284
We will find a way to help.

01:01:40.365 --> 01:01:41.514
Okay.

01:01:44.525 --> 01:01:46.561
(ominous music)

01:01:59.645 --> 01:02:02.113
(gentle dramatic music)

01:02:23.125 --> 01:02:25.081
(suspenseful music)

01:02:29.925 --> 01:02:31.517
(gentle dramatic music)

01:02:43.965 --> 01:02:45.284
Kara used to be a baker.

01:02:46.045 --> 01:02:49.435
13 years ago she owned
a very successful cafe

01:02:49.445 --> 01:02:52.562
until she got her money
tied up with this guy.

01:02:52.565 --> 01:02:55.637
He's considered to be
Arizona's Bernie Madoff.

01:02:59.285 --> 01:03:01.196
You wanna use the machine again?

01:03:01.885 --> 01:03:05.036
This guy is a convicted embezzler.

01:03:05.045 --> 01:03:07.081
He took her for everything that she had.

01:03:07.085 --> 01:03:09.155
She lost the bakery,
she went bankrupt.

01:03:10.165 --> 01:03:12.121
We kill him, she has the money

01:03:12.125 --> 01:03:13.001
to pay the doctor bills

01:03:13.005 --> 01:03:14.757
and get Aggie the
medication that she needs.

01:03:14.765 --> 01:03:16.084
Uh, wait a moment.

01:03:16.085 --> 01:03:18.918
Uh, we're killing someone for stealing?

01:03:18.925 --> 01:03:21.644
I- I don't think.

01:03:21.645 --> 01:03:23.636
The thing is, this guy died in jail,

01:03:23.645 --> 01:03:26.478
so we'd just be shortening his life

01:03:26.885 --> 01:03:28.398
by two, two-and-a-half years.

01:03:28.405 --> 01:03:29.679
That's a long time.

01:03:31.645 --> 01:03:32.998
You wanted to help Kara.

01:03:33.845 --> 01:03:35.403
FERTIL CIR

01:03:37.605 --> 01:03:42.201
Okay, but doesn't,
doesn't changing Kara's life

01:03:42.205 --> 01:03:44.639
also change Darby's life?

01:03:47.085 --> 01:03:48.564
I'm not losing you again.

01:03:51.765 --> 01:03:54.916
I will do some diggings.

01:04:04.085 --> 01:04:05.757
Okay, I don't think
it will be a problem.

01:04:05.765 --> 01:04:09.280
Darby has worked at
Erimos since he was 22.

01:04:10.285 --> 01:04:11.513
[Sophie] I don't know.

01:04:12.445 --> 01:04:14.595
Honestly, it might
not even be possible.

01:04:14.605 --> 01:04:15.674
Still have to figure out a way

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:17.641
to extend the machine's range.

01:04:18.285 --> 01:04:19.843
There's the plasma idea.

01:04:20.085 --> 01:04:22.679
Uh-uh, our upper
limit is five years.

01:04:22.685 --> 01:04:23.720
That maybe doubles it.

01:04:23.725 --> 01:04:24.953
- It's not enough.
- No, actually

01:04:24.965 --> 01:04:26.557
it's eight years, the range.

01:04:26.565 --> 01:04:28.078
- Actually it's five years.
- No, no, no.

01:04:28.085 --> 01:04:29.040
I can assure you,

01:04:29.045 --> 01:04:31.878
the engine can affect
eight years in the past.

01:04:32.965 --> 01:04:34.842
You can assure us, how?

01:04:36.525 --> 01:04:39.562
Do you remember the Mirror Hill shooting?

01:04:42.965 --> 01:04:44.034
No?

01:04:46.725 --> 01:04:48.522
You used the machine without us?

01:04:48.525 --> 01:04:50.641
And saved 26 children.

01:04:50.645 --> 01:04:52.476
That's not the point.

01:04:52.485 --> 01:04:54.999
We are considering killing
a person for stealing.

01:04:55.005 --> 01:04:56.802
I stopped a mass shooting.

01:04:56.805 --> 01:04:58.796
Considering, not actually killing.

01:04:58.805 --> 01:05:01.842
Jabir, we are partners, right?

01:05:01.845 --> 01:05:03.801
You didn't think for one
second to consult with me

01:05:03.805 --> 01:05:05.318
about these kinds of decisions?

01:05:05.325 --> 01:05:06.121
No, brother.

01:05:06.125 --> 01:05:08.923
You know I've always been
honest about my intentions.

01:05:08.925 --> 01:05:10.916
You used the machine
behind our back.

01:05:10.925 --> 01:05:11.914
How many times?

01:05:11.925 --> 01:05:13.074
- Only once.
- How many times?

01:05:13.085 --> 01:05:15.280
Come on, I'm telling
you, only one time.

01:05:15.285 --> 01:05:16.320
- Really?
- Yes.

01:05:16.325 --> 01:05:18.316
I wish I could believe that.

01:05:22.605 --> 01:05:26.996
Listen, I cannot save my family.

01:05:27.005 --> 01:05:29.314
No matter how powerful
we make this machine,

01:05:29.325 --> 01:05:32.123
I cannot get them back, okay?

01:05:34.045 --> 01:05:37.117
You made the machine
to save your family.

01:05:37.125 --> 01:05:41.277
Yes, but if I save
them, everything resets.

01:05:45.845 --> 01:05:48.757
Everything resets.
Everything he's done is undone.

01:05:48.765 --> 01:05:51.074
If he saves his family, he
doesn't move to America.

01:05:51.085 --> 01:05:51.995
We don't build the machine.

01:05:52.005 --> 01:05:54.041
You don't use it to kill Darby.

01:05:56.165 --> 01:05:57.518
And you're dead.

01:05:59.725 --> 01:06:00.999
Possibly.

01:06:01.845 --> 01:06:03.961
(gentle dramatic music)

01:06:05.485 --> 01:06:10.513
Listen, I cannot help my family,

01:06:10.725 --> 01:06:12.317
so I help others.

01:06:13.645 --> 01:06:16.955
If we want to use this
machine to help Kara,

01:06:18.005 --> 01:06:20.838
we can use it to help Kara.

01:06:22.245 --> 01:06:24.236
(solemn music)

01:06:45.405 --> 01:06:47.965
(solemn music continues)

01:06:55.725 --> 01:06:57.716

01:06:58.765 --> 01:06:59.959
You're always missing-

01:06:59.965 --> 01:07:01.876
Did you hear about
David got detention?

01:07:01.885 --> 01:07:03.523
Yeah, that's what
we're just talking about.

01:07:03.525 --> 01:07:06.164
- It's so weird.
- I know, it's so weird.

01:07:06.645 --> 01:07:08.556
- Mom?
- Hey.

01:07:09.045 --> 01:07:10.558
Shouldn't you be be at work?

01:07:11.285 --> 01:07:13.401
Well, um, I thought maybe

01:07:13.405 --> 01:07:16.522
you might wanna
skip soccer practice

01:07:16.525 --> 01:07:18.163
and we do something instead.

01:07:18.165 --> 01:07:19.314
[Riley] Like what?

01:07:19.325 --> 01:07:20.917
ENN TR Rll

01:07:24.685 --> 01:07:27.483
If I say yes, can we invite Aggie?

01:07:28.765 --> 01:07:30.198
(Sophie chuckles)

01:07:31.005 --> 01:07:33.678

01:07:36.165 --> 01:07:37.484

01:07:38.165 --> 01:07:39.393
Yay!

01:07:41.365 --> 01:07:43.754

- I had that.

01:07:43.765 --> 01:07:45.483
(Sophie laughing)

01:07:52.165 --> 01:07:54.315
- Oh!
- It was so close.

01:07:57.405 --> 01:07:58.724
It was this close.

01:08:00.445 --> 01:08:02.117
(gentle upbeat music)

01:08:03.485 --> 01:08:05.237
Hey, you guys want
some milkshakes?

01:08:07.525 --> 01:08:08.924
I just wanna have fun.

01:08:08.925 --> 01:08:10.358
Yeah. Thank you.

01:08:14.605 --> 01:08:17.597
I mean, that one made,
made me really irritated.

01:08:17.925 --> 01:08:19.040
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

01:08:33.205 --> 01:08:35.560

01:08:57.845 --> 01:09:01.281
[Announcer] Doctor Robert,
please head to ortho.

01:09:01.285 --> 01:09:03.640
Doctor Robert,
please head to ortho.

01:09:03.645 --> 01:09:04.441
What's wrong with her?

01:09:04.445 --> 01:09:07.243
I dunno, sweetie. I'm sorry, I don't know.

01:09:08.565 --> 01:09:10.760
(sighs) Your dad's here.

01:09:26.525 --> 01:09:29.164
(machine beeping)

01:10:00.685 --> 01:10:03.074
There's no guarantee it will work.

01:10:08.565 --> 01:10:10.840
Well, then we will
find something that does.

01:10:12.325 --> 01:10:15.078
(solemn music)

01:10:29.805 --> 01:10:31.716
So the radius times two.

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:34.840
So that's. I don't wanna
use my own handwriting.

01:10:34.845 --> 01:10:36.563
I don't want you
to get in trouble.

01:10:37.005 --> 01:10:40.042

(Sophie laughing)

01:10:42.445 --> 01:10:44.754

01:10:56.125 --> 01:10:58.002
(gentle dramatic music)

01:11:00.525 --> 01:11:01.162
[Kara] All right, Aggie,

01:11:01.165 --> 01:11:02.234
time to get something in your belly.

01:11:02.245 --> 01:11:03.519
Mom, I'm not hungry.

01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:05.204
Soup, how about soup?

01:11:05.405 --> 01:11:06.281
Hey.

01:11:25.205 --> 01:11:27.196
(gentle dramatic
music continues)

01:11:40.245 --> 01:11:41.598
(Aggie giggling)

01:11:49.725 --> 01:11:51.443
Aggie gets to go home today.

01:11:51.525 --> 01:11:52.799
That's great.

01:11:53.445 --> 01:11:55.242
She has to go
back in a few weeks.

01:11:55.245 --> 01:11:57.122
Some kind of follow-up surgery.

01:11:57.925 --> 01:11:59.438
God, that poor girl.

01:12:00.845 --> 01:12:02.801
I was wondering if I
can skip my launch meeting

01:12:02.805 --> 01:12:04.204
so I could be there.

01:12:05.445 --> 01:12:06.798
Would that be okay?

01:12:08.405 --> 01:12:11.477
Yeah. I think that'd
be really sweet.

01:12:13.045 --> 01:12:14.603
- Mom?
la

01:12:15.325 --> 01:12:17.714
I'm glad you invited
her over for dinner.

01:12:19.725 --> 01:12:20.919
Me too.

01:12:21.285 --> 01:12:24.641
(footsteps approaching)

01:12:30.885 --> 01:12:32.477

01:12:42.485 --> 01:12:43.998
[Sophie] I owe it to her.

01:12:45.325 --> 01:12:46.963
[Mal] Should we say something?

01:12:46.965 --> 01:12:48.114
[Jabir] Like what?

01:12:48.845 --> 01:12:49.994
I don't know.

01:12:50.525 --> 01:12:53.835
My dad used to apologize
before killing a spider.

01:12:55.725 --> 01:12:57.795
We're about to kill a human being.

01:12:58.605 --> 01:13:00.357
(somber music)

01:13:02.365 --> 01:13:04.640

and all the good things,
we thank you, Lord.

and all of our bad days,

01:13:16.165 --> 01:13:19.316
for the birds in the sky
and the fish in the sea,

Hey, Riley. What you got today?

01:13:35.285 --> 01:13:37.480
Welcome home present,
peanut butter cups.

01:13:37.485 --> 01:13:39.362
Ah, be careful.

01:13:39.925 --> 01:13:41.199
You're gonna spoil her.

01:13:45.245 --> 01:13:47.475
Second floor. Room 216.

01:13:51.845 --> 01:13:54.279

01:14:05.965 --> 01:14:08.081

01:14:08.445 --> 01:14:10.322
Okay. And here you go.

01:14:10.325 --> 01:14:11.599
Bring it right out.

01:14:14.645 --> 01:14:17.318
Welcome. Uh, we'll
be right with you.

01:14:22.005 --> 01:14:23.597
I don't see Aggie.

01:14:26.165 --> 01:14:27.484
There's photos.

01:14:28.885 --> 01:14:30.204
IN l-1d

01:14:33.205 --> 01:14:34.957
Hi, guys. Sorry for the wait.

01:14:34.965 --> 01:14:38.514
We have our new Caprice
prosciutto sandwich on ciabatta,

01:14:38.525 --> 01:14:39.116
if you would like that.

01:14:39.125 --> 01:14:42.003
And then we also have
our coffee menu up there.

01:14:43.045 --> 01:14:44.763
(Sophie laughing)

01:14:46.605 --> 01:14:47.674
Hello?

01:14:48.725 --> 01:14:51.285
- I'll take some baklava.
- Yeah.

01:14:57.525 --> 01:15:00.403
We have to find a way
to reintroduce them.

01:15:00.725 --> 01:15:01.635
Well, you did it before.

01:15:01.645 --> 01:15:02.919
You can do it again.

01:15:02.925 --> 01:15:04.916
Wish you were
there this morning.

01:15:06.245 --> 01:15:08.156
Riley really likes her.

01:15:08.805 --> 01:15:11.000
- My wife, the matchmaker.
- Matchmaker.

01:15:12.805 --> 01:15:14.124
I hate to tell you
this, my friend,

01:15:14.125 --> 01:15:17.435
but you have some competition.

01:15:17.445 --> 01:15:19.959
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do.

01:15:19.965 --> 01:15:21.956
- I know.
- Oh my God.

01:15:22.605 --> 01:15:23.754
- Come on.
- I swear.

01:15:23.765 --> 01:15:25.642
- Okay, I know.
- This is incredible.

01:15:25.645 --> 01:15:28.557
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, stop exaggerating.

01:15:31.365 --> 01:15:32.354
Okay.

01:15:35.925 --> 01:15:37.040

Outstanding.

01:15:38.165 --> 01:15:39.439
- Outstanding.
- Yeah.

01:15:40.885 --> 01:15:41.761
It's a close second.

01:15:41.765 --> 01:15:44.598
- A close second?
- You are a liar.

01:15:44.605 --> 01:15:45.674
It's 1:30, we have to go,

01:15:45.685 --> 01:15:47.084
if we're gonna make
it to Riley's launch.

01:15:47.085 --> 01:15:48.677
I'll stay. You guys go.

01:15:48.885 --> 01:15:51.194
I wanna enjoy our coffee.

01:15:51.205 --> 01:15:52.957
Hey, bring these for me, okay?

Her launch is at 3:00, right?

01:16:33.685 --> 01:16:34.754
On the dot.

01:16:35.245 --> 01:16:36.598
Can you check?

01:16:36.605 --> 01:16:37.321
- I'm sure it's fine.
- Please?

01:16:37.325 --> 01:16:38.474
Probably just mixed
up the location.

01:16:38.485 --> 01:16:39.713
I'm gonna try her cell phone.

01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:40.561
She's got a launch.

01:16:40.565 --> 01:16:41.554
She's not gonna pick it up.

01:16:41.565 --> 01:16:42.793

brought some more snacks.

Oh my gosh,

01:17:12.005 --> 01:17:14.235

- Okay.

01:20:07.845 --> 01:20:10.120

There's no way this
should've happened.

01:20:39.925 --> 01:20:42.723
Hank Montclair should've
had nothing to do with this.

01:20:42.965 --> 01:20:44.239
It doesn't matter.

01:20:44.245 --> 01:20:46.122
- Of course it matters.
- No, it doesn't.

01:20:46.125 --> 01:20:47.240
It doesn't.

01:20:47.245 --> 01:20:50.317
That boy is gonna walk
outta here to his parents.

01:20:50.325 --> 01:20:51.883

be holding a crown.

I don't. It- it.

There's gotta be some kind
of correlation or something.

First up, a new twist
on an old classic.

Riley Rice will be performing
a scene from "Hamlet,"

01:22:12.085 --> 01:22:14.360

what if Jabir saves this family?

01:29:52.125 --> 01:29:56.084
I was wrong before.
We're not his parents.

01:29:58.485 --> 01:30:01.761
His parents are the ones
that took him to plays.

01:30:01.765 --> 01:30:03.721
They played with him and
they laughed with him.

01:30:03.725 --> 01:30:05.841
And his parents held
him when he cried

01:30:05.845 --> 01:30:08.234
and they nursed him
when he was sick.

01:30:09.605 --> 01:30:14.235
We are imposters and we will
only ever disappoint him.

couldn't even move.

having nobody to call.

that to you again.

Maybe you don't.

01:30:49.005 --> 01:30:51.314
Maybe without Jabir you
don't cross the street

01:30:51.325 --> 01:30:52.804
in that exact moment.

01:30:52.805 --> 01:30:54.477
And maybe I still
do cross the street

01:30:54.485 --> 01:30:55.838
- at that exact same moment.
- All I know,

01:30:55.845 --> 01:30:57.517
the only thing I know

01:30:58.405 --> 01:31:01.044
is that whatever
life we end up with,

01:31:02.325 --> 01:31:04.964
it will be the

01:31:08.605 --> 01:31:11.915

01:31:11.925 --> 01:31:13.244

01:31:17.325 --> 01:31:18.758
As long as you're
not in the room

01:31:18.765 --> 01:31:21.723
when I use the machine,
your memories will align.

01:31:23.965 --> 01:31:25.842
And you're on board
with this, Jabir?

01:31:27.045 --> 01:31:28.603
Yeah, I am.

01:31:28.845 --> 01:31:30.642
But you have no idea
where you're gonna be.

01:31:31.245 --> 01:31:33.634
You have no idea what your
life is gonna be like.

01:31:33.645 --> 01:31:35.442
You'll have no
memories of anything.

01:31:35.645 --> 01:31:38.000
But my family will be alive.

01:31:38.325 --> 01:31:41.442
Maybe. Been 10 years, a
lot could have happened.

01:31:41.445 --> 01:31:44.642
Then I will have
given us more time.

01:31:58.085 --> 01:32:03.364
Nah. No, we have no
idea what's gonna happen.

01:32:03.365 --> 01:32:05.833
The risk is way too high.

01:32:05.845 --> 01:32:07.563
Not for our child.

01:32:09.805 --> 01:32:11.523
