WEBVTT

00:03.100 --> 00:05.033
‐ Hey, Kyle.
‐ Oh, what's up, dawg?

00:05.100 --> 00:07.266
What's up,
my precious little pruner?

00:07.333 --> 00:09.066
‐ Muah.
‐ Muah.

00:09.133 --> 00:11.833
Hey, ain't it time for
your favorite game show?

00:11.900 --> 00:14.500
"Queen For A Day"
hosted by RuPaul.

00:16.766 --> 00:18.700
Oh. No, no, no.
Not for another hour.

00:18.766 --> 00:20.233
Hmm.

00:20.300 --> 00:22.200
Oh, well, um..

00:22.266 --> 00:24.400
Can you make me some toast?

00:24.466 --> 00:25.633
Absolutely.

00:25.700 --> 00:27.700
Kyle, would you like
some toast as well?

00:27.766 --> 00:29.100
English muffin, please.

00:29.166 --> 00:31.100
‐ Butterin' only the nooks.
‐ Okay.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.266
Oh, very sly, Overton.

00:35.333 --> 00:37.500
The toast request
was a stroke of genius.

00:37.566 --> 00:39.500
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ So, what's up?

00:39.566 --> 00:41.800
Well, I wanted you
to be the first to know.

00:41.866 --> 00:43.400
I'm gonna ask Synclaire
to marry me.

00:48.300 --> 00:50.166
Alright, look,
I‐I know you're shocked

00:50.233 --> 00:52.866
'cause the Obie schedule love
doesn't have me proposing to her

00:52.933 --> 00:54.166
for another six to eight months

00:54.233 --> 00:58.033
but, hey, man, my heart
couldn't wait no longer.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.633
Wait, wait, Overton,
when, when that last girl

01:00.700 --> 01:02.606
rejected your proposal,
you told me

01:02.673 --> 01:04.540
that you would
cut out your tongue

01:04.605 --> 01:07.340
before you asked another woman
to marry you.

01:07.406 --> 01:09.406
Well, now I can look back

01:09.473 --> 01:12.506
and see the humor in that desire
to mutilate myself.

01:14.740 --> 01:17.440
Look, man, just‐just so you know
that when you get married

01:17.506 --> 01:19.706
it is for the
rest of your life, right?

01:19.773 --> 01:22.840
That is day in and day out.

01:22.906 --> 01:26.306
Until you die,
and they bury you side by side.

01:26.373 --> 01:28.006
In the same plot.

01:28.940 --> 01:30.206
Yuck!

01:31.473 --> 01:32.573
Man..

01:32.640 --> 01:35.240
...decomposing
with my baby forever.

01:37.740 --> 01:39.373
Man, that's beautiful.

01:39.440 --> 01:40.973
That's sick.

Hey, I know you and Keith
like all these stuff

02:22.313 --> 02:24.513
but since when do
your mama eat fu‐fu‐fu?

02:26.046 --> 02:27.013
She'll eat it.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.046
All I have to do is tell her

02:28.113 --> 02:29.646
it's something like
sawmill stew

02:29.713 --> 02:31.246
and horseshoe biscuits.

02:32.846 --> 02:34.346
Last week's meatloaf.

02:34.413 --> 02:35.946
‐ Who's this for?
‐ Max!

02:36.013 --> 02:37.346
It'll keep him
from grabbing a fork

02:37.413 --> 02:39.646
and pulling a chair
right up to the stove.

02:41.080 --> 02:43.346
Keith meeting your mom.
Sounds serious.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.346
Well, it's more of
a precautionary measure.

02:45.413 --> 02:47.280
I mean, before I get too much
more involved with Keith

02:47.346 --> 02:49.346
I've gotta make sure
he can stomach her.

02:49.413 --> 02:53.346
Hey, maybe I ought to add some
tequila to the beef bourguignon.

02:53.413 --> 02:54.746
[knock at door]

02:56.446 --> 02:58.080
[sniffing]

03:01.253 --> 03:02.520
Ahh!

03:02.586 --> 03:04.520
[laughing]

03:05.320 --> 03:06.586
[smacking lips]

03:10.186 --> 03:11.720
Well, that outta keep her
from begging

03:11.786 --> 03:13.753
for scraps
under the table.

03:13.820 --> 03:16.020
Could you give me
a hand with this?

03:19.386 --> 03:23.586
Khadijah, I just have
the most fabulous idea.

03:23.653 --> 03:25.453
Why don't you join us, huh?

03:25.520 --> 03:27.686
I mean, there's plenty of food!

03:27.753 --> 03:29.686
I‐it'll be fun.

03:30.953 --> 03:33.420
Regine, I will not be the airbag

03:33.486 --> 03:36.053
in this three‐car pile up
that could beat this dinner.

03:36.120 --> 03:37.886
No, Khadijah, please.
Don't leave me like this.

03:37.953 --> 03:38.986
[doorbell dings]
Khadi..

03:42.286 --> 03:43.253
[sighs]

03:45.820 --> 03:47.453
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.453
[both moan]

03:50.886 --> 03:51.920
Alright, enough of that.

03:51.986 --> 03:53.486
I gotta brief you
about my mama.

03:53.553 --> 03:54.786
Re..

03:54.853 --> 03:57.653
Regine, baby.
I've been around mothers before.

03:57.720 --> 03:59.886
‐ I've even got one.
‐ Yeah. Baby, no. See.

03:59.953 --> 04:02.293
Nobody has one of these
but me.

04:02.360 --> 04:03.460
Now, listen,
here's what I need you..

04:03.526 --> 04:04.626
[doorbell dings]

04:06.226 --> 04:08.160
Okay. A word of caution
before I open the door.

04:08.226 --> 04:10.526
Do not look
directly into her outfit.

04:13.893 --> 04:16.093
‐ Baby!
‐ Mom!

04:17.793 --> 04:19.726
I bought Champale!

04:25.193 --> 04:26.926
Keith, this is my mother.

04:26.993 --> 04:28.693
Mom, this is Keith.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.593
Mrs. Hunter,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

04:30.660 --> 04:34.326
So, this is the painter.

04:34.393 --> 04:36.059
Now, Keith,
I don't wanna ask you

04:36.126 --> 04:38.459
a whole lot
of personal questions..

04:39.993 --> 04:41.326
...but is there
any mental illness

04:41.393 --> 04:43.526
in your family?

04:43.593 --> 04:46.193
Not anymore. All the really
crazy ones killed each other.

04:47.860 --> 04:49.193
[laughs]

04:49.260 --> 04:50.893
Alright, now, let's get to
the important stuff.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.260
What do you think
of my new outfit?

04:52.326 --> 04:54.126
Well, I think it
makes a statement.

04:54.193 --> 04:57.360
It says you take risks and
you enjoy breaking the rules.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.566
This one's a keeper, Regine!

05:04.100 --> 05:05.633
Yo, Overton. I..

05:10.400 --> 05:11.666
Overton, come here.

05:11.733 --> 05:14.266
Now, are you sure about
this marriage concept thing?

05:14.333 --> 05:15.800
Because as your best friend

05:15.866 --> 05:17.100
it is my job to make sure

05:17.166 --> 05:18.933
that you are not doing this
impetuously.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.600
So, why don't you take a decade
or two to think about it?

05:23.700 --> 05:26.700
Aw, you know,
I value your advice, Kyle

05:26.766 --> 05:28.833
but, uh, this time
I received a sign

05:28.900 --> 05:30.833
from an even higher authority.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.600
[scoffs]
God?

05:36.600 --> 05:39.200
No offense, bro, but there are
few steps between you

05:39.266 --> 05:41.500
and the Almighty, okay?

05:41.566 --> 05:42.600
No, I'm talking about
the saleslady

05:42.666 --> 05:44.600
down at Hobar's Antique Shop.

05:45.966 --> 05:47.366
See, I was in the back

05:47.433 --> 05:49.700
checking out this Victorian
chisel kit, right?

05:49.766 --> 05:52.933
And I spotted her handing
Synclaire this diamond ring.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.233
Man, when she put it
on her finger

05:55.300 --> 05:56.700
her face just lit up.

05:56.766 --> 05:59.700
And...that image
just said it all.

05:59.766 --> 06:03.140
So, now all I need is for you
to give me back my money.

06:04.573 --> 06:07.173
Oh! The money you won
from the basketball contest?

06:07.240 --> 06:09.740
Man, you know that money's tied
up in a mini‐mall in Jersey!

06:09.806 --> 06:11.740
What about your savings?

06:11.806 --> 06:14.173
Oh, man, I had to
liquidate those assets.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.573
My uncle's smoke guard needed

06:15.640 --> 06:18.773
a little septic tank
in the worst way.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.140
Well, Overton, you know you
can't get that money back

06:21.206 --> 06:23.440
out of the mini‐mall without
paying a substantial penalty

06:23.506 --> 06:24.906
on that $3000.

06:24.973 --> 06:28.340
I gotta get that ring, man!

06:28.406 --> 06:30.773
Yeah, guess I'm gonna
have to go see Victor Pinky

06:30.840 --> 06:32.973
in his office at
the Burger King parking lot.

06:33.040 --> 06:36.006
Overton, Overton, Ov, Ov..

06:36.073 --> 06:37.940
Well, I guess if you're
willing to risk your pinkies

06:38.006 --> 06:39.640
for Synclaire
then this is the right time.

06:39.706 --> 06:41.940
So I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

06:42.006 --> 06:45.240
I'm gonna arrange financing
for you.

06:45.306 --> 06:47.240
‐ You'd do that for me, man?
‐ My boy, man!

06:47.306 --> 06:49.973
‐ Oh, thanks, man!
‐ It's me! Okay.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.040
That's a load
off my mind, man!

06:52.106 --> 06:54.140
I was just thinking
if Victor Pinky didn't have it

06:54.206 --> 06:57.073
I was thinking about
going to see Joe the Kidney.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.846
I mean, I could not
believe it, yo!

07:01.913 --> 07:04.180
Mom and Keith actually talked
for over an hour.

07:04.246 --> 07:06.613
Mom was almost late
getting to her Bingo game.

07:06.680 --> 07:07.880
(Khadijah)
'For real?'

07:07.946 --> 07:10.046
The only time Mama Hunter
was ever late to Bingo

07:10.113 --> 07:13.146
was the night the
Poseidon Adventure was on TV.

07:13.213 --> 07:14.746
Umm, that Shelley Winters moved

07:14.813 --> 07:16.746
through the water like orca,
didn't she?

07:18.280 --> 07:20.413
Well, it makes sense
that Keith will like your mom.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.713
You all have
so much in common.

07:22.780 --> 07:24.146
‐ Hi!
‐ Hi!

07:26.446 --> 07:30.346
Mama Hunter, I have always
wanted a bag exactly like that.

07:31.713 --> 07:33.813
Well, I didn't buy this,
I won it yesterday

07:33.880 --> 07:36.413
playing Bingo and qualified
for Saint Cecilia's

07:36.480 --> 07:38.713
$500 Holy Cash Cow Tournament.

07:40.613 --> 07:43.280
But I'm not here
to toot my own horn.

07:43.346 --> 07:45.780
I came here to give you this.

07:45.846 --> 07:47.246
Oh!

07:47.313 --> 07:49.713
I am so proud of the daughter
I raised.

07:49.780 --> 07:51.946
Keith is talented,
he's successful.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.313
Plus he treats you right

07:53.380 --> 07:55.713
and he's got
a sense of fashion.

07:57.613 --> 07:59.346
Do you know soon
you'll be leafing

07:59.413 --> 08:01.353
through the pages
of your wedding album?

08:01.420 --> 08:03.353
And there'll be some beans
in that oven.

08:04.986 --> 08:08.820
[sighs]
I finally feel like
I've done something right.

08:08.886 --> 08:11.086
Oh, I'll see you later,
baby girl.

08:12.520 --> 08:14.053
"Beans in the oven."

08:15.986 --> 08:17.186
Regine, you just makes me wanna

08:17.253 --> 08:20.020
call out
some perfect baby names.

08:20.920 --> 08:22.453
Syncoverton!

08:31.586 --> 08:34.253
Hey, uh, thanks again
for tolerating my mother.

08:34.320 --> 08:35.653
Look. Stop thanking me, alright?

08:35.720 --> 08:37.720
I like your mom.

08:37.785 --> 08:39.720
Why are you saying this?

08:39.785 --> 08:41.086
Is she here?

08:43.352 --> 08:46.386
Look, your mom has real spark.
Alright? Like, "Boom!"

08:46.453 --> 08:48.420
Spontaneous combustion.

08:48.486 --> 08:51.686
Well, honey, I, I think you have
all the spontaneous combustion

08:51.753 --> 08:53.953
you can handle right here.

08:55.986 --> 08:57.520
Well, well, baby..

08:57.586 --> 08:59.786
You know, you're more like
a smoldering campfire.

08:59.853 --> 09:02.060
You glow a little
before you boom.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.526
Excuse you!

09:04.593 --> 09:06.793
But I am very spontaneous.

09:08.326 --> 09:11.260
I don't think you're up
for the challenge.

09:11.326 --> 09:13.960
Oh, see now, I think
you underestimate me.

09:14.026 --> 09:15.393
Oh, really?

09:23.560 --> 09:25.126
‐ Hey, dude.
‐ Hey, man! Come‐come on.

09:25.193 --> 09:26.526
So, so, did you get the ring?

09:26.593 --> 09:29.193
Na, I went down there, and damn
if they hadn't already sold it.

09:29.260 --> 09:30.860
Oh, no, no!
Overton, you can't give up!

09:30.926 --> 09:32.060
Man, you can't give up,
you gotta go

09:32.126 --> 09:33.393
back down to the pawnshop,
right?

09:33.460 --> 09:35.260
And demand the name
and the number of the person

09:35.326 --> 09:36.860
who bought that ring,
and then you got to go, man.

09:36.926 --> 09:38.226
You gotta go down
to that house

09:38.293 --> 09:39.760
and not take "No" for an answer.

09:39.826 --> 09:41.660
Because you gotta get that ring
for Synclaire, man, what's up?

09:41.726 --> 09:43.593
I, I know, look.
I already got the name.

09:43.660 --> 09:44.960
I already got the address.

09:45.026 --> 09:46.126
The only thing holdin' me up

09:46.193 --> 09:49.293
is you and your
motivational speech, okay?

09:51.226 --> 09:53.493
Oh, well, get a receipt.

09:56.026 --> 09:57.293
Ah! Hey, Overton!

09:57.360 --> 09:59.293
No time to say "Hello" back.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.700
What's his problem?

10:03.766 --> 10:05.666
He seems to think
that I'm long‐winded

10:05.733 --> 10:07.900
simply because I asked him
to take the initiative‐‐

10:07.966 --> 10:09.466
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

10:10.966 --> 10:12.233
Well, I will make this brief

10:12.300 --> 10:14.233
so as not to annoy you.

10:15.600 --> 10:18.433
Regine and Keith are up on
the roof getting their laundry.

10:21.066 --> 10:22.600
Isn't that wonderful?

10:22.666 --> 10:25.033
A man who helps
with the laundry.

10:25.100 --> 10:27.033
You know, my first husband,
he couldn't leave‐‐

10:27.100 --> 10:28.733
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
whatever.

10:31.766 --> 10:35.133
(Regine)
Say my name! Ah!

10:35.200 --> 10:37.233
Oh! Say my name!

10:37.300 --> 10:38.966
(Keith)
Regine.

10:39.033 --> 10:40.866
Regine!

10:42.600 --> 10:44.433
(Regine)
Ah, spell it!

10:47.633 --> 10:49.166
Regine?

10:51.300 --> 10:52.800
Regine!

11:01.640 --> 11:02.773
Oh, oh, oh. Mommy!

11:02.840 --> 11:04.573
It's not what it looks like!

11:04.640 --> 11:05.940
Good cover, baby!

11:06.873 --> 11:08.506
I loved my cupcakes.

11:08.573 --> 11:10.206
Ma, let me explain!

11:10.273 --> 11:11.773
Oh, no, baby.
Those are my drawers.

11:11.840 --> 11:12.806
Oh!

11:14.906 --> 11:16.373
You can't eat
these cupcakes now.

11:16.440 --> 11:17.573
They, they're ruined.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.973
They.. Nobody's gonna want them.

11:21.173 --> 11:22.440
Um, Mrs. Hunter!

11:22.506 --> 11:23.773
The door is jammed.
Here, let me get it.

11:23.840 --> 11:24.773
Let me get it.

11:24.840 --> 11:27.440
Oh, what a mess.
What a mess.

11:27.506 --> 11:30.273
Oh, icing's everywhere!

11:30.340 --> 11:33.273
And I'm all out of,
I'm all out of vanilla extract.

11:34.906 --> 11:36.840
It took so long to bake it.

11:36.906 --> 11:39.840
Mom, would you forget
about the stupid cupcakes?

11:41.040 --> 11:42.340
How could you do this?

11:42.406 --> 11:43.706
I bring you goodies,
you're up here

11:43.773 --> 11:45.706
giving yours away.

11:48.373 --> 11:50.573
Alright. Now, see,
you're overreacting.

11:52.973 --> 11:55.840
Ew, I've got to go!

12:01.880 --> 12:05.746
Well, that was the most
embarrassing moment of my life.

12:06.980 --> 12:08.280
[applause]

12:10.146 --> 12:11.413
Max!

12:13.080 --> 12:15.080
[knock at door]

12:17.880 --> 12:19.180
‐ Yeah?
‐ Mr. Kellum.

12:19.246 --> 12:21.013
Overton Wakefield Jones.

12:21.080 --> 12:23.213
Oh, yeah, the young lady
at the antique store

12:23.280 --> 12:24.446
said you'd get
in touch with me.

12:24.513 --> 12:26.680
‐ Well, come on in. Come on in.
‐ Thank you.

12:28.113 --> 12:32.180
Wow, that's a nice‐looking
coffee table you got there.

12:32.246 --> 12:33.546
Yeah, mini‐compass.

12:33.613 --> 12:35.546
Yeah, that's my one vice.

12:35.613 --> 12:37.846
Nothing I like better than
to buzz the observation deck

12:37.913 --> 12:39.380
of the World Trade Center

12:39.446 --> 12:41.446
and watch all those
tourists scatter!

12:43.713 --> 12:46.713
Uh, uh, sir, I,
I was wondering if you'd

12:46.780 --> 12:49.246
consider selling me that
diamond ring you just bought

12:49.313 --> 12:50.846
'cause I'd really
like for it to be

12:50.913 --> 12:53.213
my Synclaire's engagement ring.

12:53.280 --> 12:56.446
Synclaire, huh?
Well, tell me about her.

12:56.513 --> 13:00.653
Well, it's kinda hard to
put Synclaire into words.

13:00.720 --> 13:01.786
Did you ever get up
in the morning

13:01.853 --> 13:03.053
and raise the blinds

13:03.120 --> 13:06.420
and everything starts to glow?

13:06.486 --> 13:09.520
That's what it's like every time
my baby walks into the room.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.420
Hey, how's she built?

13:14.720 --> 13:16.920
Yeah, she's stacked up,
pretty nice too!

13:17.953 --> 13:19.020
Just like my Lily.

13:19.086 --> 13:20.453
The first time I saw her

13:20.520 --> 13:21.886
she had legs so pretty

13:21.953 --> 13:23.953
I wanted to bet on 'em.

13:25.253 --> 13:28.186
Uh, sir, I was
kinda hoping that, uh..

13:28.253 --> 13:30.920
you and your wife would
wanna sell us the ring

13:30.986 --> 13:33.520
after you hear the amazing story
that's connected to it.

13:33.586 --> 13:36.920
See, uh, I spotted Synclaire
trying on the ring at the store

13:36.986 --> 13:38.753
and it was at that moment
I was certain

13:38.820 --> 13:40.120
that I wanted to propose

13:40.186 --> 13:42.553
and that, that was the ring
that she should wear.

13:42.620 --> 13:43.920
‐ Uh‐huh?
‐ Yeah.

13:43.986 --> 13:45.186
Oh, oh, that's it?

13:45.253 --> 13:46.586
That's the end?

13:46.653 --> 13:49.453
Oh, that is pretty amazing.

13:49.520 --> 13:53.020
You know, I, I bought
that ring back in 1943.

13:53.086 --> 13:55.620
I was over fighting
the Germans over in France.

13:55.686 --> 13:57.920
And luckily,
I had that ring on me

13:57.986 --> 14:00.260
when our unit was pinned down
by enemy fire.

14:00.326 --> 14:02.160
You see, our radio conked out.

14:02.226 --> 14:04.826
And I signaled with
that diamond for help!

14:04.893 --> 14:06.060
'Well, when I got back here'

14:06.126 --> 14:07.160
'they threw me a big parade'

14:07.226 --> 14:08.660
'and in the excitement
of celebration'

14:08.726 --> 14:10.460
'I, I lost track of the ring.'

14:10.526 --> 14:11.593
Until the other day

14:11.660 --> 14:13.626
when I walked
into that antique store

14:13.693 --> 14:15.260
and there it was!

14:15.326 --> 14:18.460
Right down of the little nicks
it had from the Nazi bullets.

14:20.926 --> 14:24.293
Huh. Well, so we both have
great stories.

14:25.926 --> 14:27.426
Uh, look, I,
I was thinking about

14:27.493 --> 14:28.860
talking to your wife about it

14:28.926 --> 14:30.160
but I don't,
I don't wanna press you.

14:30.226 --> 14:31.593
Oh, oh, wait.
Come on, come on, now.

14:31.660 --> 14:34.260
You seem like a pretty
determined young man.

14:34.326 --> 14:35.960
I'll, I'll go get her.

14:43.426 --> 14:45.360
[laughs]

14:46.593 --> 14:48.093
Overton!

14:48.160 --> 14:49.826
This is my Lily.

14:49.893 --> 14:51.193
Start talking.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.393
Oh, after, uh,
after meeting her

14:55.460 --> 14:58.126
I can pretty much tell
her mind is made up.

14:59.693 --> 15:01.066
You know, it, it's amazing

15:01.133 --> 15:03.433
that Max was able to turn out
a four‐page newsletter

15:03.500 --> 15:05.666
about the Regine incident
in such a short time!

15:06.800 --> 15:08.333
You can't beat the title.

15:08.400 --> 15:11.000
"Mom goes poof over roof goof."

15:14.533 --> 15:17.366
Uh, Regine, um,
I can understand

15:17.433 --> 15:19.666
why you'd be
a bit humiliated right now

15:19.733 --> 15:23.000
but, um, maybe you should
get a bucket of water.

15:24.366 --> 15:25.866
What for, Kyle?

15:25.933 --> 15:27.866
♪ The roof
The roof ♪

15:27.933 --> 15:30.433
♪ The roof is on fire ♪

15:30.500 --> 15:32.433
[laughing]

15:34.933 --> 15:37.166
[door opens]
Alright, come on now, Boo.

15:37.233 --> 15:38.666
Now, you know,
you'd be clowning too

15:38.733 --> 15:40.233
if the shoe on
another foot.

15:41.133 --> 15:42.433
Of course,
in this case

15:42.500 --> 15:44.666
the shoe was on
Keith's shoulder!

15:46.433 --> 15:47.733
Come on, Khadijah!

15:47.800 --> 15:50.133
Mama hasn't talked
to me in days.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.700
I went by her house, and she
wouldn't even open the door!

15:52.766 --> 15:55.133
Well, maybe she's not
in the mood.

15:55.200 --> 15:58.433
This is a woman who'll talk
to anyone about anything.

15:58.500 --> 16:02.206
She's made Jehovah's witnesses
say, "We really have to go."

16:04.240 --> 16:06.706
Well, now, you're the one
always goin' on

16:06.773 --> 16:08.440
about how you want your mother
out of your life.

16:08.506 --> 16:10.040
‐ Now you got it.
‐ No, no.

16:10.106 --> 16:11.606
See, if I'm not
talking to my mother

16:11.673 --> 16:12.640
that's one thing.

16:12.706 --> 16:14.040
But if she's
not talking to me

16:14.106 --> 16:15.540
that's just wrong.

16:17.873 --> 16:19.406
I miss my mommy.

16:21.106 --> 16:23.040
What was that?

16:23.106 --> 16:26.240
I miss her. Alright?
Leave me the hell alone.

16:26.306 --> 16:28.406
Well, it seems to me,
you need to just find a place

16:28.473 --> 16:30.006
where she can't
get away from you.

16:30.073 --> 16:31.073
How about the mall?

16:31.140 --> 16:33.673
Umm. She knows
the layout too well.

16:34.873 --> 16:36.673
Church.

16:36.740 --> 16:38.140
Bingo!

16:38.206 --> 16:40.140
Yeah, the big Bingo tournament
is tonight.

16:40.206 --> 16:41.640
There's no way
she'll miss that.

16:41.706 --> 16:43.040
Well, so, grab Keith

16:43.106 --> 16:45.206
go on down to the church,
and clear this whole thing up.

16:45.273 --> 16:46.540
I don't know,
Keith sent mom

16:46.606 --> 16:49.106
the FTD
"I'm So Embarrassed" bouquet.

16:49.173 --> 16:52.206
She sent him a "Thank You" card
with some cupcakes.

16:54.006 --> 16:55.940
This is obviously
between mom and me.

16:56.840 --> 16:57.873
Let's go, Khadijah.

16:57.940 --> 16:59.273
Hold on!

16:59.340 --> 17:00.613
I ain't goin'!

17:00.680 --> 17:03.513
Ah, Khadijah, come on now!

17:03.580 --> 17:06.713
Do it, do it
for our friendship, huh?

17:08.012 --> 17:10.713
You, you can't
put a price on that!

17:10.780 --> 17:12.413
Yes, I can. $50.

17:14.613 --> 17:15.713
$50?

17:15.780 --> 17:17.713
Hey! We're tight.

17:21.713 --> 17:24.180
B‐51.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.580
There she is,
in her lucky hat.

17:29.646 --> 17:32.013
The guy who sold it to her
is the lucky one.

17:33.646 --> 17:34.713
Ma.

17:34.780 --> 17:35.746
What are you doing here?

17:35.813 --> 17:37.080
We need to talk.

17:37.146 --> 17:39.380
I‐47.

17:41.380 --> 17:42.513
You can't sit here.

17:42.580 --> 17:44.713
This section is
for gold card players only.

17:45.813 --> 17:47.513
Oh, thank you, sister girl.

17:48.913 --> 17:51.246
‐ Ma, come on, we need to‐‐
‐ Regine, please, this is not‐‐

17:51.313 --> 17:53.680
‐ Mommy, you're making a scene‐‐
‐ I'm not making a scene with‐‐

17:53.746 --> 17:55.113
Will you two stop?

17:55.180 --> 17:57.113
The security nuns
are looking at us!

18:01.486 --> 18:02.853
Alright now, look.

18:02.920 --> 18:04.220
I've been trying
to apologize

18:04.286 --> 18:05.820
for this roof thing
for the last few days

18:05.886 --> 18:06.986
but you won't let me!

18:07.053 --> 18:08.953
Apologizing isn't gonna
change anything!

18:09.020 --> 18:10.653
Oh, and shutting me out is?

18:10.720 --> 18:13.886
O‐28.

18:13.953 --> 18:15.820
‐ Now, ma, I need to‐‐
‐ Regine, this is a church.

18:15.886 --> 18:16.820
I don't wanna hear it.

18:16.886 --> 18:18.053
Well, ma,
you're gonna hear it.

18:18.120 --> 18:19.553
Now, I'm sorry
that you caught me

18:19.620 --> 18:21.286
having spontaneous, wild sex

18:21.353 --> 18:22.986
on the roof of my building!

18:29.686 --> 18:32.820
Isn't that a long title
for a movie?

18:36.120 --> 18:38.720
Now, is what I did
so unforgivable?

18:38.786 --> 18:40.420
It's not what you did.

18:40.486 --> 18:42.620
It's, it's what I've done.

18:42.686 --> 18:44.353
It's all my fault.

18:44.420 --> 18:47.420
G‐14.

18:47.486 --> 18:49.353
Don't worry.
I got it, Mama Hunter.

18:49.420 --> 18:51.453
Ma, what are you talking about?

18:52.786 --> 18:56.686
Regine, the truth is,
you weren't planned!

18:58.020 --> 19:00.460
I know. I've seen
the wedding pictures.

19:00.526 --> 19:02.226
I mean, unless you had
the caterer up under there

19:02.293 --> 19:04.326
you were obviously pregnant.

19:05.626 --> 19:08.226
Well, what you don't know is
how it happened.

19:09.793 --> 19:12.360
We were all by ourselves
up in the Left Field Bleachers

19:12.426 --> 19:14.893
at Shae's Stadium.

19:14.960 --> 19:17.426
Cleon Jones got a single move,
Steve in the second

19:17.493 --> 19:19.660
and I got excited.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.926
Then Ron Swoboda,
he rips a base hit

19:21.993 --> 19:23.360
into the Right Field gap

19:23.426 --> 19:24.593
Sevar ran the third!

19:24.660 --> 19:25.893
And as soon as Sevar scored..

19:25.960 --> 19:28.160
Ooh‐sha! So did your father.

19:31.493 --> 19:34.026
You have the soul
of a poet, mom.

19:34.093 --> 19:37.026
Look, you were a kid.
You were just 17!

19:37.093 --> 19:38.560
You weren't thinking.

19:38.626 --> 19:40.693
I'm a grown woman.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.393
And I don't like baseball.

19:43.793 --> 19:47.093
Regine, I have raised you to be
more responsible than I was.

19:47.160 --> 19:49.293
Then I see you
up on that roof, and it..

19:49.360 --> 19:52.526
Oh, it's Ron Swoboda
all over again.

19:52.593 --> 19:55.726
N‐43.

19:55.793 --> 19:58.293
Booyah! Swap the thing! Fa‐fing!

19:59.660 --> 20:02.566
Honey, I just want
you to have more choices

20:02.633 --> 20:03.600
than I gave myself!

20:03.666 --> 20:04.833
Ma!

20:04.900 --> 20:07.333
Alright, look,
no beans are goin' in my oven

20:07.400 --> 20:09.333
until I'm ready
to cook them.

20:11.466 --> 20:13.933
You and I are completely
different, okay?

20:14.000 --> 20:15.333
I mean, I'm..

20:15.400 --> 20:17.066
I'm‐I'm Ritz Carlton

20:17.133 --> 20:20.066
and you're Ritz Crackers.

20:22.866 --> 20:25.800
I'm DKNY and you're..

20:28.300 --> 20:30.233
Where did you get that hat?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.933
You're not just saying this
to make me feel better?

20:34.000 --> 20:35.366
No, mom, no!

20:35.433 --> 20:37.366
You and I
are completely different!

20:37.433 --> 20:39.366
We're worlds apart.

20:39.433 --> 20:41.733
Oh, oh, baby!

Alright!

20:54.000 --> 20:55.500
Next stop, Walmart!

20:55.566 --> 20:57.200
Oh! No, no, no!

20:59.033 --> 21:01.073
Over my dead body.

21:01.140 --> 21:03.073
Lord and Taylor.

‐ Cool.

21:07.673 --> 21:09.440
Hey! I marked
the cards for you.

21:09.506 --> 21:11.540
Don't I get a cut?

Hey, how far you plannin' on
flyin' away from home, man?

21:39.927 --> 21:43.127
Oh, relax! I got enough fuel
for another half hour.

21:44.827 --> 21:46.761
Make that 15 minutes.

You know, I haven't had
a co‐pilot up here

21:51.994 --> 21:53.927
since my Lily passed away.

21:53.994 --> 21:56.094
Oh, I, I feel honored.

21:56.161 --> 21:58.127
By the way,
how did your wife die?

21:58.194 --> 21:59.961
Well, let me
