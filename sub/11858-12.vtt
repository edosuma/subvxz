WEBVTT

00:47.458 --> 00:50.166
- Customers bothering you?
- People are so rude.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.000
And what's with the
music?
Christmas is over.

00:52.083 --> 00:53.625
I'm surprised you're not
hiding out in the back room

00:53.709 --> 00:54.709
with the rest of them.

00:54.792 --> 00:56.750
I don't smoke.
Makes my hair
smell.

00:58.458 --> 00:59.875
Got anything
going back to China?

00:59.959 --> 01:02.083
- Going back to what?
- The manufacturer.

01:03.375 --> 01:04.917
You've never played
the China game?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
What's that?

01:06.083 --> 01:07.041
First one to find something

01:07.125 --> 01:08.542
not made in China wins.

01:10.667 --> 01:12.208
Okay.

01:12.291 --> 01:13.750
"Made in China."

01:13.834 --> 01:15.208
"China."

01:15.291 --> 01:16.875
Uh-huh, "Made in Taiwan."

01:16.959 --> 01:19.792
- Same thing.
- No, it's not. Is it?

01:31.500 --> 01:32.875
I never noticed before.

01:32.959 --> 01:35.041
It's like everything's
made in China.

01:36.458 --> 01:37.667
Kind of sad.

01:37.750 --> 01:40.291
Anything made here anymore?

01:40.375 --> 01:42.125
Well, let's see, there's me

01:42.208 --> 01:45.166
there's you, and, uh,
depending
on how many kids we have..

01:45.250 --> 01:48.834
Ooh, you're sweet,
but I got a
boyfriend.

01:48.917 --> 01:50.333
It's alright. I got time.

02:15.875 --> 02:18.208
(woman on TV)
'With one fatality
and a half dozen injured'

02:18.291 --> 02:19.500
in the post-Christmas bombing

02:19.583 --> 02:22.041
at a local Big Box
Electronics store

02:22.125 --> 02:23.625
authorities are still searching

02:23.709 --> 02:26.041
for anyone
who may have information

02:26.125 --> 02:28.625
'that could help find
the responsible party.'

02:42.125 --> 02:44.083
(John)
'The explosion occurred
at 7:30 this morning.'

02:44.166 --> 02:47.083
A pipe bomb planted in one
of the open gym lockers.

02:47.166 --> 02:49.750
Half a dozen injured,
one critically.

02:49.834 --> 02:51.083
The guy who opened the locker?

02:51.166 --> 02:52.917
John Wojciechowski.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.458
Found his left hand embedded
in the opposite wall.

02:55.542 --> 02:57.583
Air Force Academy ring
still on it.

02:57.667 --> 02:59.125
- 'Pilot?'
- Not anymore.

02:59.208 --> 03:03.083
IED, Rush. A nasty
little bitch in a box.

03:03.166 --> 03:04.333
What's that, Louie?

03:04.417 --> 03:06.458
"Improvised explosive device."

03:06.542 --> 03:08.000
Um, trip wire triggered

03:08.083 --> 03:10.375
pipe bomb enclosed
in some sort of..

03:10.458 --> 03:11.542
...wooden box.

03:11.625 --> 03:12.875
Packed with screws and nails

03:12.959 --> 03:14.375
pieces of metal shrapnel.

03:14.458 --> 03:15.583
Junk bomb.

03:15.667 --> 03:18.125
But not exactly a cold job.

03:18.208 --> 03:21.041
This one may be related
to at least two, maybe three

03:21.125 --> 03:22.667
prior bombings in the city.

03:22.750 --> 03:25.083
(Louie)
'Big Box Electronics store
back in '99'

03:25.166 --> 03:27.667
engineering firm in '01

03:27.750 --> 03:30.792
and County Hospital
two years later.

03:30.875 --> 03:32.125
'Signature is the same.'

03:32.208 --> 03:34.125
There hasn't been
a bomb fatality in
Philadelphia

03:34.208 --> 03:36.250
in over what, five years?

03:36.333 --> 03:38.250
Which is why we thought
the guy who did this one

03:38.333 --> 03:39.667
was locked up or long gone.

03:39.750 --> 03:41.625
- What, killed himself?
- Or maimed.

03:41.709 --> 03:45.291
Often happens to people
who play with explosives.

03:45.375 --> 03:47.125
Or who go to the gym
in the morning.

03:47.208 --> 03:48.917
The feds ever look into it?

03:49.000 --> 03:50.959
Looked, but never found a link.

03:51.041 --> 03:53.166
Attacks were local,
never used the mail

03:53.250 --> 03:54.375
no federal jurisdiction.

03:54.458 --> 03:55.959
Any connection
between the targets?

03:56.041 --> 03:59.291
Public places, but otherwise
pretty indiscriminate.

03:59.375 --> 04:01.625
So, we have no idea
what this lunatic wants

04:01.709 --> 04:03.959
or where he's gonna hit next.

04:04.041 --> 04:05.875
Just that he's alive and well.

04:05.959 --> 04:07.417
And back with a vengeance.

04:53.083 --> 04:56.208
I was just looking
for that shirt.

04:56.291 --> 04:59.917
And here I was beginning
to think you were a vampire.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.500
Why's that?

05:01.583 --> 05:03.083
First time you
stayed till sunup.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.875
I'm not sure how much longer

05:05.959 --> 05:08.250
we're gonna be able to
keep this on the down
low.

05:08.333 --> 05:09.750
People are talking.

05:09.834 --> 05:11.834
Really? Who?

05:13.625 --> 05:14.667
How about that?

05:14.750 --> 05:16.834
Never met a DA
afraid of
publicity.

05:18.250 --> 05:19.417
Depends what kind.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.250
Lady's got a reputation,
you know.

05:21.333 --> 05:22.583
Oh, just when I thought I'd try

05:22.667 --> 05:24.458
to make an honest
woman out of you.

05:24.542 --> 05:29.250
Get real. You haven't even
bought me breakfast yet.

05:29.333 --> 05:31.166
Well, how about dinner?

05:31.250 --> 05:34.625
I know the perfect place.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.834
I was kinda enjoying
the skulking around stage.

05:37.917 --> 05:41.625
Dinner? That might involve
having a real conversation.

05:41.709 --> 05:44.917
Well, that's why
they invented
wine.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.208
You sure you want to spoil it

05:47.291 --> 05:50.375
just when things
were going so well?

05:50.458 --> 05:52.208
We're adults.

05:52.291 --> 05:54.166
I'm sure we'll find
something to talk
about.

05:54.250 --> 05:56.375
You mean besides
dirtbags and doers?

05:59.667 --> 06:03.583
I'm gonna have to
requisition
that shirt now, lady.

06:14.125 --> 06:16.834
Initial forensics confirm
the bomb contained parts

06:16.917 --> 06:19.083
consistent with
the three other
attacks.

06:19.166 --> 06:20.667
Two dead
and two critically maimed

06:20.750 --> 06:22.291
over a nine-year period.

06:22.375 --> 06:23.709
Not a lot of
help
from the feds

06:23.792 --> 06:24.792
in any of the cases.

06:24.875 --> 06:26.917
Or willingness
to share information.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.875
Big surprise.
Locations? Victims?

06:29.959 --> 06:32.208
Big Box Electronics
store back in '99.

06:32.291 --> 06:35.291
Curt Fitzpatrick, floor
manager,
21 died on the scene.

06:35.375 --> 06:37.750
Kinetic Core Engineering firm,
2001.

06:37.834 --> 06:40.542
(Will)
'Gene Schmidt, 42-year-old
father of three'

06:40.625 --> 06:42.667
blinded by a bomb
outside the building.

06:42.750 --> 06:43.709
Survived.

06:43.792 --> 06:44.959
(Kat)
'Roderick Poole didn't.'

06:45.041 --> 06:46.333
'30-year-old
physician's assistant'

06:46.417 --> 06:48.458
'killed at County Hospital
back in 2003.'

06:48.542 --> 06:50.208
And now Wojciechowski
at a sports club.

06:50.291 --> 06:53.083
(John)
'Recently engaged
commercial airline pilot.'

06:53.166 --> 06:55.959
Targets are scattershot,
no common denominator.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.834
Except wrong
place,
wrong time.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.333
But all in public places
with a lot of foot traffic.

07:00.417 --> 07:01.834
Could be the locations
he's targeting.

07:01.917 --> 07:03.583
Claim as many victims
as possible.

07:03.667 --> 07:05.500
One angry sociopath.

07:05.583 --> 07:07.166
Bomb construction
tell us anything?

07:07.250 --> 07:08.875
Um, some trigger mechanism.

07:08.959 --> 07:12.250
Not your garden-variety
crackpot
mixing fertilizer and ammonia.

07:12.333 --> 07:14.000
Louie and the bomb squad
are putting together

07:14.083 --> 07:15.500
a full analysis of the parts.

07:15.583 --> 07:17.000
We've got a fresh
crime scene for once.

07:17.083 --> 07:18.709
We line up interviews
with every witness?

07:18.792 --> 07:20.291
Except the night-cleaning crew.

07:20.375 --> 07:22.375
The manager of the sports club
is stonewalling.

07:22.458 --> 07:24.417
You don't think he might
be subcontracting

07:24.500 --> 07:25.667
the work out to illegals?

07:25.750 --> 07:27.250
Told him he doesn't
give us every last name

07:27.333 --> 07:28.917
we'll bring in ICE
and shut him down.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.375
Let's keep this in our house.

07:30.458 --> 07:33.500
We don't need the feds
coming in now to muck things
up.

07:33.583 --> 07:34.959
Just called the hospital.

07:35.041 --> 07:36.583
Our pilot's out of surgery.

07:36.667 --> 07:38.667
After he sees his family,
anything he can remember.

07:42.125 --> 07:44.458
It was like a thunderclap.

07:44.542 --> 07:46.542
I didn't know what hit me.

07:46.625 --> 07:48.834
I know this is hard, John, but..

07:48.917 --> 07:51.542
...if there's anything you
remember, it might help.

07:54.417 --> 07:55.959
Everything just went blank.

07:57.250 --> 07:59.291
Came to when I was
on the ground..

08:01.291 --> 08:03.500
...reached down to
prop
myself up, but..

08:05.208 --> 08:06.333
'...couldn't.'

08:08.959 --> 08:12.166
Me and Jen just bought
our wedding rings too, you
know?

08:13.583 --> 08:17.458
You see anyone suspicious
in the area beforehand?

08:17.542 --> 08:20.542
'Looked out of place?
Didn't belong?'

08:20.625 --> 08:22.250
No, when I got my hearing back..

08:24.000 --> 08:26.125
...there was this awful ringing.

08:28.333 --> 08:31.417
- I heard this whistling
sound.
- Whistling?

08:31.500 --> 08:32.583
All the chaos, I couldn't tell

08:32.667 --> 08:33.875
where it was coming from.

09:03.208 --> 09:05.458
I know I was going
into shock but I swear

09:05.542 --> 09:07.667
that I heard
somebody whistling.

09:09.417 --> 09:10.625
Who the hell would do that?

09:10.709 --> 09:12.000
You get a look at that guy?

09:14.709 --> 09:16.750
Not a good one, he..

09:16.834 --> 09:18.625
...had, like, a cap
pulled down tight.

09:18.709 --> 09:22.625
That song, sound familiar?

09:22.709 --> 09:23.959
Not really.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.041
You think that was the guy
that did this to me?

09:28.125 --> 09:31.667
It's possible the bomber
stayed nearby to..

09:31.750 --> 09:33.625
...see if it worked.

09:33.709 --> 09:34.959
Well, if you catch him

09:35.041 --> 09:37.959
you tell the bastard
that I'm still alive.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.667
(Will)
'It's Angel Perez,
Mexican illegal.'

09:45.750 --> 09:47.583
Got his name off
the night-cleaning crew list

09:47.667 --> 09:49.500
from the manager
of the sports club.

09:49.583 --> 09:51.333
- Where'd you find him?
- Sacks Park.

09:51.417 --> 09:53.792
Tried to skate
when we ID'd
him.

09:53.875 --> 09:55.917
He's pretty upset right now.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.709
Doesn't speak a word of English.

09:57.792 --> 09:59.542
Yeah, we'll see about that.

09:59.625 --> 10:02.417
Pretty sure I speak
a language he'll understand.

10:06.250 --> 10:08.792
(Scotty)
'Hey.'

10:10.667 --> 10:12.500
You wanna tell me why
you ran from the police?

10:16.750 --> 10:17.917
<i>'Me entiende?'</i>

10:18.000 --> 10:19.250
<i>Habla Espanol?</i>

10:20.583 --> 10:23.041
No? Okay.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.125
<i>habla Ingles</i>

10:27.208 --> 10:29.917
and you can't understand
my Spanish, is that the game?

10:32.750 --> 10:33.792
Right.

10:35.959 --> 10:39.166
I got a cousin
that works in
ICE.

10:39.250 --> 10:40.792
(Scotty)
<i>amigo.'</i>

10:40.875 --> 10:42.208
Either you tell me
everything you saw

10:42.291 --> 10:44.542
in the next
ten seconds or we bounce

10:44.625 --> 10:47.333
your sorry ass out on
the next bus to the border.

10:51.959 --> 10:53.500
Oye,
- No.

10:54.458 --> 10:56.041
No, it's okay.

10:56.125 --> 10:57.375
(Scotty)
'Wait. Sorry.'

10:57.458 --> 10:58.542
You got something
you want to tell me?

10:58.625 --> 11:00.875
<i>Si, si, entiendo, um..</i>

11:02.458 --> 11:03.875
I understand.

11:03.959 --> 11:05.208
Hold on a sec, will ya?

11:10.333 --> 11:12.709
It's not what I see.

11:12.792 --> 11:15.125
It's what I hear.

11:54.583 --> 11:55.917
A music box?

11:56.000 --> 12:00.458
Minute later, bomb
go off, same
locker.

12:00.542 --> 12:03.041
Everything go crazy.

12:03.125 --> 12:06.208
I get scared, I run.

12:10.375 --> 12:13.000
I thought it was my fault.

12:13.083 --> 12:14.667
Sit tight.

12:14.750 --> 12:17.667
We're gonna need you to give an
exact description of that box.

12:19.625 --> 12:20.750
<i>Gracias, Angel.</i>

12:23.125 --> 12:24.291
An old music box?

12:24.375 --> 12:25.583
The bomb delivery device.

12:25.667 --> 12:27.083
Kind with the
brass
cylinder inside

12:27.166 --> 12:28.792
turns and plays a song.

12:28.875 --> 12:31.333
Almost all music boxes
were made of wood

12:31.417 --> 12:32.333
at the turn of the century.

12:32.417 --> 12:33.458
Can't be too many companies

12:33.542 --> 12:35.125
still in business making those.

12:35.208 --> 12:36.458
I found one company in Vermont

12:36.542 --> 12:38.000
that still supplies parts.

12:38.083 --> 12:39.917
Nice old lady told me
that they sell cylinders

12:40.000 --> 12:42.083
that play mostly
American standards.

12:42.166 --> 12:44.166
(Nick)
'And that another
customer in Philly'

12:44.250 --> 12:45.583
ordered multiple cylinders

12:45.667 --> 12:47.125
all playing the same song.

12:47.208 --> 12:49.417
- "John Henry."
- "John Henry."

12:49.500 --> 12:51.625
That could've been
the song playing on the box.

12:51.709 --> 12:53.208
(Nick)
'Well, I asked
the DA's office to subpoena'

12:53.291 --> 12:54.834
their purchasing records.

12:54.917 --> 12:57.333
John Henry, steel-driving man.

12:57.417 --> 12:59.458
I remember that story as a kid.

12:59.542 --> 13:01.417
Railroad guy with
the hammer, right?

13:01.500 --> 13:02.667
Yeah, raced against
a steam drill

13:02.750 --> 13:03.667
tunneling through a mountain.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.500
Yeah, and John Henry won.

13:05.583 --> 13:07.500
Then he keeled over and died.

13:07.583 --> 13:08.667
It means something to this guy.

13:08.750 --> 13:10.000
Man versus machine?

13:10.083 --> 13:12.625
Maybe a disgruntled,
anti-government type.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.166
(Scotty)
'Could be a militia nutjob.'

13:14.250 --> 13:16.125
Doesn't exactly
connect the locations.

13:17.583 --> 13:19.417
Purchaser's name
is Carl Baxter.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.166
(female #2)
'Paid with a credit
card.'

13:22.291 --> 13:24.375
Shipping address is Mantua.

13:24.458 --> 13:26.750
I already got you a search
warrant for the residence.

13:26.834 --> 13:28.875
Anything else you need
on this, let me know.

13:28.959 --> 13:30.542
Call SWAT and
the bomb squad. Let's go.

13:40.875 --> 13:43.083
Nobody home.

13:43.166 --> 13:45.417
Better pray for no surprises.

13:55.333 --> 13:56.375
Over here.

13:59.125 --> 14:01.834
Look familiar?

14:01.917 --> 14:05.250
(Nick)
'Fitzpatrick,
Schmidt and Poole.'

14:05.333 --> 14:06.750
All his previous victims.

14:06.834 --> 14:08.500
Not so random after all.

14:08.583 --> 14:11.291
Wasn't the locations he was
targeting, it was
individuals.

14:11.375 --> 14:14.583
Wedding announcement,
Luke and Beth Ross.

14:14.667 --> 14:15.750
(Nick)
'That's ten years old.'

14:15.834 --> 14:17.250
(Lilly)
'Luke Ross.'

14:17.333 --> 14:20.875
That name was on the
sports club member list.

14:20.959 --> 14:23.709
This guy belongs
to the gym, too?

14:23.792 --> 14:26.041
No photo.
Nothing on Wojciechowski.

14:26.125 --> 14:27.792
Our bomber hit the wrong guy?

14:27.875 --> 14:31.250
If that's the case, he's got
some unfinished business.

14:31.333 --> 14:33.583
Yeah, and we just
found his next target.

14:40.417 --> 14:43.083
(Lilly)
'CSU dusted for prints.
Got the whole block staked
out.'

14:43.166 --> 14:44.458
Nothing from the canvass?

14:44.542 --> 14:46.208
Building management
thinks he's a squatter.

14:46.291 --> 14:48.041
What about the guy in
the wedding photo announcement?

14:48.125 --> 14:50.041
Luke Ross, portfolio manager.

14:50.125 --> 14:51.500
Lives in Chestnut Hill.

14:51.583 --> 14:54.166
- What have we got?
- 'Music box.'

14:54.250 --> 14:57.792
Home entertainment system,
circa 1900.

14:57.875 --> 14:59.166
(Nick)
'Brass cylinder'

14:59.250 --> 15:00.375
'thousand little teeth'

15:00.458 --> 15:02.625
turn and slowly
pluck a metal comb

15:02.709 --> 15:04.458
out comes the music.

15:04.542 --> 15:06.333
'Bomb squad said
the cylinder was rigged'

15:06.417 --> 15:08.125
'to trigger the explosion.'

15:08.208 --> 15:12.333
Trip wire, triggers
an electric fuse..

15:12.417 --> 15:14.667
...after a full revolution.

15:14.750 --> 15:16.625
(Lilly)
'After the song ends.'

15:16.709 --> 15:20.750
People admire the
craftsmanship,
want to touch the box.

15:20.834 --> 15:22.333
(John)
'Soon as they open it..'

15:22.417 --> 15:25.041
Starts the song, arms the bomb.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.333
Took some serious
electro-mechanical skill

15:27.417 --> 15:29.041
to rig one of these
with a pipe bomb.

15:29.125 --> 15:30.083
What about the song?

15:30.166 --> 15:31.583
John Henry's the underdog

15:31.667 --> 15:32.709
a David and Goliath story.

15:32.792 --> 15:34.166
It's also a protest song.

15:34.250 --> 15:35.417
Against the machine?

15:35.500 --> 15:36.875
Or management.

15:36.959 --> 15:39.375
Production efficiency
at the expense of the worker.

15:39.458 --> 15:42.000
(John)
'"Say before I let this
steam drill beat me down'

15:42.083 --> 15:44.208
I'll hammer
my fool self to death."

15:44.291 --> 15:46.583
John Henry died
with a hammer in his hand.

15:46.667 --> 15:50.041
He beat the machine
but killed himself doing it.

15:50.125 --> 15:52.166
This guy thinks
his cause is noble.

15:52.250 --> 15:53.667
And he's got something to prove.

15:53.750 --> 15:56.417
With his own pretty
little killing machine.

16:03.458 --> 16:04.834
Does that have
real bullets in
it?

16:04.917 --> 16:07.250
Mia, why don't you go watch
The Pink Panther now?

16:07.333 --> 16:08.375
Okay.

16:09.792 --> 16:11.875
You're a financial planner,
Mr. Ross?

16:11.959 --> 16:15.041
Yeah. But I've never had so
much
as a dispute with a client.

16:15.125 --> 16:17.083
Anyone else you know
might be holding a grudge?

16:17.166 --> 16:19.375
- 'Personal or otherwise?'
- No.

16:19.458 --> 16:20.542
(Luke)
'No one at all.'

16:20.625 --> 16:22.458
You concur, Mrs. Ross?

16:24.333 --> 16:25.625
There was that one call, Luke.

16:25.709 --> 16:27.208
(Beth)
'You remember?'

16:27.291 --> 16:28.875
- What call?
- A couple of months ago.

16:28.959 --> 16:30.834
The one from the bank
about our credit card.

16:30.917 --> 16:31.834
It was nothing.

16:31.917 --> 16:34.667
No. It was definitely something.

16:34.750 --> 16:36.542
(man on phone)
'Can you just tell us
if you have any recurring'

16:36.625 --> 16:38.208
'monthly charges
on the card, ma'am?'

16:38.291 --> 16:42.208
Certainly, newspapers,
DVD rental subscription

16:42.291 --> 16:44.417
my husband's monthly
gym membership.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.750
'Yes. And the name
of that facility?'

16:46.834 --> 16:48.250
Philly Sport & Racquet Club.

16:48.333 --> 16:51.083
'Right, and were there
any other additional charges'

16:51.166 --> 16:53.125
'to that business
that you're aware of?'

16:53.208 --> 16:55.709
Other than
the monthly membership?

16:55.792 --> 16:58.417
Oh. There may be charges
to the juice bar.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.375
'And those charges
would occur..'

17:00.458 --> 17:03.959
In the morning, around 7:00,
every Tuesday and Thursday.

17:04.041 --> 17:06.250
'Thank you, ma'am.
Just a few more questions.'

17:06.333 --> 17:09.333
'Is your husband still
employed
at Mutual Heritage Bank?'

17:09.417 --> 17:10.583
Yes. Why?

17:10.667 --> 17:11.959
'Well, it must be nice'

17:12.041 --> 17:14.625
'to make a living
off the backs of others.'

17:14.709 --> 17:15.917
Excuse me?

17:16.000 --> 17:17.166
'I hope you
and your husband are enjoying'

17:17.250 --> 17:18.250
'your new purchases.'

17:18.333 --> 17:20.583
'Love the blue curtains,
by the way.'

17:24.333 --> 17:25.333
Who is this?

17:31.000 --> 17:34.291
Police said they couldn't
do anything about a prank
call.

17:34.375 --> 17:36.959
(Kat)
'That's how the bomber
knew Luke's routine.'

17:37.041 --> 17:38.709
'When he went to that gym.'

17:38.792 --> 17:39.875
(Luke)
'I just didn't go yesterday'

17:39.959 --> 17:41.959
'cause I...took Mia to school.

17:42.041 --> 17:43.500
I was upset
by the call at the time

17:43.583 --> 17:46.083
but to think I could've
gotten my husband killed..

17:46.166 --> 17:47.458
You have any idea
what the caller

17:47.542 --> 17:48.792
might have meant
by that comment

17:48.875 --> 17:50.709
about how you make a living?

17:50.792 --> 17:51.959
No.

17:52.041 --> 17:53.333
(Kat)
'We'll check your phone
records'

17:53.417 --> 17:55.458
see if we can trace the call.

17:55.542 --> 17:58.417
I don't understand.
Why is this happening to us?

17:58.500 --> 18:00.500
For your own safety
we'll provide your family

18:00.583 --> 18:02.625
with a police detail.

18:06.792 --> 18:09.333
Bomber called his targets
posing as a credit card rep.

18:09.417 --> 18:11.208
To get their daily
routines, habits.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.583
Went after them
in public places.

18:12.667 --> 18:13.667
Make it seem random.

18:13.750 --> 18:15.166
Ross got lucky.

18:15.250 --> 18:17.917
- Wojciechowski, not so much.
- That info stays here.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.709
Press doesn't know
he missed his intended
target

18:19.792 --> 18:21.166
maybe our killer
doesn't either.

18:21.250 --> 18:22.875
No sense endangering Ross.

18:22.959 --> 18:25.542
A dump on the Ross home phone
traced the harassing call

18:25.625 --> 18:28.917
back to a pay phone at the
20th Street train station.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
He's on the move.
Worth a canvass.

18:31.083 --> 18:33.583
Check the station's
security cameras.

18:33.667 --> 18:35.667
Carl Baxter
isn't going anywhere.

18:35.750 --> 18:36.959
I subpoenaed
the credit card app

18:37.041 --> 18:38.875
'to get his social
security number.'

18:38.959 --> 18:42.125
Turns out the real Carl Baxter
is upstate in Frackville.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.166
Been locked up since '95.

18:48.375 --> 18:50.083
Philly's finest.

18:50.166 --> 18:53.291
Is there a reason for the
cell
and strip search, fellas?

18:53.375 --> 18:56.417
So you don't
spontaneously combust.

18:56.500 --> 18:59.583
What gives?
I don't use and I don't
deal.

18:59.667 --> 19:00.917
Ask anyone inside.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.417
Use what?

19:02.500 --> 19:03.834
Methamphetamine.

19:03.917 --> 19:06.625
What y'all locked me up for.
Distribution.

19:06.709 --> 19:09.166
Says you used to drive
a truck cross-country.

19:09.250 --> 19:10.875
California. Crank capital.

19:10.959 --> 19:14.166
Wasn't me that brought it in,
it would have been someone
else.

19:14.250 --> 19:16.000
Also spent some time
in the military.

19:16.083 --> 19:21.041
Judge gave me a choice
when I was 18, army or jail.

19:21.125 --> 19:22.375
Can't say it helped much.

19:22.458 --> 19:24.250
Is that where
you learned about munitions?

19:24.333 --> 19:26.667
- Demolition, explosives?
- No.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.959
Talking about pipe bombs, Carl.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.083
Pipe what?

19:32.166 --> 19:35.208
Y'all are smoking some
better stuff than I ever
had.

19:35.291 --> 19:37.917
You graduate high school, Carl?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.583
I'm working on my GED.

19:39.667 --> 19:41.083
(Nick)
'Forget it.
This guy's a lummox.'

19:41.166 --> 19:43.000
- A what?
- Don't worry about it.

19:43.083 --> 19:44.583
Someone stole
your identity, pal.

19:44.667 --> 19:46.625
Just can't figure out
why he picked you.

19:53.041 --> 19:54.250
Whoa, whoa, hold up.

19:55.834 --> 19:56.917
Turn around.

19:59.917 --> 20:01.083
Hold your arms out.

20:05.834 --> 20:07.625
- John Henry.
- 'Yeah.'

20:07.709 --> 20:08.917
My two boys.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.625
All but grown up now.

20:13.333 --> 20:15.834
He stole that big galoot's
identity for a reason.

20:15.917 --> 20:17.375
The song, the tattoo.

20:17.458 --> 20:18.792
Maybe he did time with Baxter?

20:18.875 --> 20:21.041
Baxter's been
locked
up for 12 years.

20:21.125 --> 20:22.458
Never shared a cell.

20:22.542 --> 20:24.417
No one on cell block D
at Frackville

20:24.500 --> 20:26.792
even comes close
to the profile.

20:26.875 --> 20:28.291
So why Baxter?

20:28.375 --> 20:30.250
It's like he's leading us

20:30.333 --> 20:31.709
trying to tell us something.

20:31.792 --> 20:32.792
About John Henry?

20:32.875 --> 20:34.083
(Nick)
'Who fought to prove something'

20:34.166 --> 20:35.583
that he still had value
as a human being.

20:35.667 --> 20:38.250
To protect his
job,
his way of life.

20:38.333 --> 20:41.333
This guy's angry. He's lashing
out at some personal beef.

20:41.417 --> 20:43.542
- 'Some wrong.'
- Something he lost?

20:43.625 --> 20:45.542
Checked with Pennsylvania
Department of Corrections

20:45.625 --> 20:47.250
to see if a third
party
could've accessed

20:47.333 --> 20:48.500
Baxter's booking info.

20:48.583 --> 20:49.959
Webmaster on the site

20:50.041 --> 20:52.834
found a number of hits
to Baxter's profile
page.

20:52.917 --> 20:54.083
Came back to a local branch

20:54.166 --> 20:56.417
of the
Philadelphia
Public Library.

20:57.583 --> 21:00.542
Yes, Mr. Baxter
is here quite a
bit.

21:00.625 --> 21:02.542
Such a nice man.

21:02.625 --> 21:05.208
Usually on the computer?
The Internet?

21:05.291 --> 21:06.834
From time to time.

21:06.917 --> 21:11.208
But mostly, he likes to
sit
over there at that
table

21:11.291 --> 21:15.458
reading or staring
at the photos on the wall.

21:23.875 --> 21:25.166
Lil.

21:25.250 --> 21:26.667
(Kat)
'Look at the caption.'

21:29.000 --> 21:32.500
"John Henry Road, 1976."

21:32.583 --> 21:33.542
Where is that?

21:33.625 --> 21:35.208
Germantown, I think.

21:35.291 --> 21:37.417
The section with the streets

21:37.500 --> 21:40.375
named after the builders
of the Pennsylvania Railroad.

21:40.458 --> 21:42.041
I only know because Mr. Baxter

21:42.125 --> 21:44.709
told me that he
grew up on that block.

21:57.375 --> 21:58.750
Here you go.

21:58.834 --> 22:00.125
Home sweet home.

22:00.208 --> 22:02.041
Just like you remembered it.

22:02.125 --> 22:04.458
John Henry Road, huh?

22:04.542 --> 22:05.667
Check out the sign.

22:07.583 --> 22:09.875
(Lilly)
'It's what he's been
trying to tell us.'

22:09.959 --> 22:11.959
The place where he grew up.

22:12.041 --> 22:14.125
Gone...and forgotten.

22:17.667 --> 22:19.417
(Kat)
Pulled city records
on John Henry Road

22:19.500 --> 22:21.625
discovered a legal battle
over a property

22:21.709 --> 22:24.709
on the street back in '96.

22:24.792 --> 22:27.417
The home was occupied
by Alessandro Rossilini.

22:27.500 --> 22:30.125
Took over the mortgage after his
father died and refused to sell.

22:30.208 --> 22:32.750
- Developers call it a
spike.
- A spike?

22:32.834 --> 22:34.709
Lone holdout
on a residential street

22:34.792 --> 22:36.083
undergoing
commercial development.

22:36.166 --> 22:37.667
(Kat)
'Records indicate Rossilini'

22:37.750 --> 22:40.500
clung to the property until
he defaulted on the mortgage

22:40.583 --> 22:41.750
and the bank foreclosed.

22:41.834 --> 22:42.917
The house was finally razed?

22:43.000 --> 22:44.375
Back in '99, about the same time

22:44.458 --> 22:45.917
Rossilini went off the grid.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Pixelerator Media
took over the property

22:48.083 --> 22:49.583
but never wound
up breaking ground.

22:49.667 --> 22:52.750
By the time the litigation
ended, the tech market crashed.

22:52.834 --> 22:56.583
Started outsourcing their
computer programmers overseas.

22:56.667 --> 22:58.041
What do we know about Rossilini?

22:58.125 --> 23:01.041
Worked ten years
at Kinetic Core Engineering

23:01.125 --> 23:02.417
laid off in '97.

23:02.500 --> 23:04.500
Same firm as Eugene Schmidt

23:04.583 --> 23:06.625
'bomb survivor '01.'

23:06.709 --> 23:10.125
Rossilini loses his job,
wants payback.

23:10.208 --> 23:11.917
We know if he has
any family in town?

23:12.000 --> 23:13.208
Divorced in '99.

23:13.291 --> 23:15.625
Had a four-year-old daughter
at the time.

23:15.709 --> 23:17.834
Alright, talk to Schmidt,
track down the ex-wife.

23:17.917 --> 23:20.959
See if she knows
where we might find him today.

23:21.041 --> 23:23.709
Hey, boss, you'll be sure
to give us a heads up, right?

23:23.792 --> 23:25.041
What's that?

23:25.125 --> 23:27.166
When they start
outsourcing murder cops.

23:34.667 --> 23:37.542
I left Kinetic
Core
after the
attack.

23:37.625 --> 23:40.333
Took me a while before I
could
walk back into any office.

23:40.417 --> 23:43.417
The bomb went off outside
the courtyard?

23:43.500 --> 23:45.458
I lost sight in my right eye.

23:45.542 --> 23:49.667
But then, it made
me quit smoking.

23:49.750 --> 23:51.166
You remember
a mechanical engineer

23:51.250 --> 23:53.166
named Alessandro Rossilini?

23:53.250 --> 23:55.625
Why? You think
he did this to
me?

23:55.709 --> 23:57.750
You remember you
let him go, right?

23:57.834 --> 24:01.125
Along with about 20
other guys in his division.

24:01.208 --> 24:03.291
I was senior VP
of project design.

24:03.375 --> 24:04.458
It wasn't personal.

24:04.542 --> 24:06.709
But he didn't
take it too well?

24:06.792 --> 24:09.166
He was a good
engineer, but..

24:09.250 --> 24:14.083
...most of them
never saw it coming.

24:14.166 --> 24:16.333
I just don't understand.
I mean..

24:16.417 --> 24:17.917
I thought you were
happy with my work.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.250
It's got nothing to do
with your performance.

24:20.333 --> 24:23.125
We're being forced to
restructure our overhead
costs.

24:23.208 --> 24:25.041
But we're profitable,
I mean, every year--

24:25.125 --> 24:27.083
'And it's my job
to keep it that way.'

24:27.166 --> 24:30.041
Look, you might wanna
think about retraining

24:30.125 --> 24:33.083
'you know, another
area of expertise.'

24:33.166 --> 24:35.750
I'm a mechanical engineer
with a masters.

24:35.834 --> 24:37.083
I have 15 years experience.

24:37.166 --> 24:39.375
'We're opening a new
plant in Bangalore'

24:39.458 --> 24:41.625
training engineers to do
computer-aided design

24:41.709 --> 24:43.875
at one-fifth the salary.

24:43.959 --> 24:45.417
You just can't
do this to people.

24:45.500 --> 24:47.834
Look, you're not hearing me,
Alessandro.

24:47.917 --> 24:49.250
'Your skills have
been commodified.'

24:49.333 --> 24:51.041
We're not the
only company doing it.

24:52.959 --> 24:56.208
I have a wife, a kid.

24:56.291 --> 24:57.875
I have a mortgage.

24:57.959 --> 24:59.709
Take the severance.

24:59.792 --> 25:01.208
'Use the time to find
some temp work'

25:01.291 --> 25:03.041
'until you figure out
something else.'

25:08.417 --> 25:12.083
But those jobs
were headed overseas

25:12.166 --> 25:13.625
and they weren't coming back.

25:20.333 --> 25:23.792
Honestly, I haven't talked
to my ex-husband in years.

25:23.875 --> 25:25.542
(female #1)
'Pretty much since the
divorce.'

25:25.625 --> 25:27.625
What did he do
after he was
fired?

25:30.792 --> 25:34.417
Alessandro just went
into a spiral

25:34.500 --> 25:35.834
trying to find a decent job

25:35.917 --> 25:36.959
at even half the salary

25:37.041 --> 25:38.583
much less benefits.

25:38.667 --> 25:39.834
But you have a daughter, right?

25:39.917 --> 25:43.166
He didn't petition
for custody, visitation?

25:45.667 --> 25:46.500
What?

25:46.583 --> 25:49.291
We lost our health insurance..

25:49.375 --> 25:51.750
...some time before
my daughter got sick.

25:54.166 --> 25:55.500
Sick?

25:55.583 --> 25:58.333
Bilateral retinoblastoma.

25:58.417 --> 26:02.125
It's a treatable cancer
if it's caught early enough.

26:03.709 --> 26:05.291
How old was your daughter?

26:05.375 --> 26:07.166
Four.

26:07.250 --> 26:09.083
(female #1)
We both were working
overtime

26:09.166 --> 26:13.417
but we...couldn't keep up
with our health premium.

26:13.500 --> 26:15.083
What about Medicaid?

26:15.166 --> 26:18.125
We qualified, but..

26:18.208 --> 26:20.333
...it just became
increasingly difficult

26:20.417 --> 26:23.458
to find the kind of care
that Sophia needed.

26:35.166 --> 26:38.041
Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me. Sir? Sir?

26:38.125 --> 26:39.583
I said excuse me.

26:39.667 --> 26:42.000
Are you, are you
a doctor? A nurse?

26:42.083 --> 26:43.834
No, I'm a physician's assistant.

26:43.917 --> 26:46.458
Oh, hi. I'm-I'm a father
of a four-year-old girl

26:46.542 --> 26:50.500
who's been waiting in that
room for over two hours now.

26:50.583 --> 26:52.625
I'm sorry, sir.
What's your name?

26:52.709 --> 26:54.542
Uh, I already gave
that to everybody here

26:54.625 --> 26:56.458
like, my name and information,
like, five times.

26:56.542 --> 26:58.166
Okay, well, then
what
you need to do is

26:58.250 --> 27:00.500
just be patient
with us, alright? In a
little--

27:00.583 --> 27:03.208
Excuse me, but my daughter..

27:03.291 --> 27:04.792
...she's been, uh, waiting

27:04.875 --> 27:05.792
in that room

27:05.875 --> 27:08.709
for a long time
in pain, okay?

27:08.792 --> 27:10.250
Waiting for a doctor, a nurse

27:10.333 --> 27:12.875
a physician's assistant or
anyone to just come and see
her.

27:12.959 --> 27:14.542
Sir, I understand.

27:14.625 --> 27:16.125
I'm sorry, our
computers are down.

27:16.208 --> 27:18.000
You're gonna have to be
patient and wait your
turn.

27:18.083 --> 27:20.583
(Alessandro)
'See, see, I don't care
about the computers.'

27:20.667 --> 27:22.875
I-I just want a human being..

27:22.959 --> 27:24.417
...to give my daughter
something for her pain.

27:24.500 --> 27:26.208
Again, I apologize
for the
inconvenience.

27:26.291 --> 27:28.834
You have insurance. You're
welcome to try another
hospital.

27:28.917 --> 27:31.583
Wait, that's your answer?
To go somewhere else?

27:31.667 --> 27:33.875
- What kind of care is this?
- Sir, let go of my arm.

27:33.959 --> 27:35.625
(Alessandro)
If the damn insurance company

27:35.709 --> 27:38.792
would've screened
my daughter a year ago

27:38.875 --> 27:40.667
we would've started
the chemo then.

27:40.750 --> 27:42.083
And then the cancer
wouldn't have spread

27:42.166 --> 27:43.542
through her entire body.

27:43.625 --> 27:45.417
I'm sorry, sir, but that
has nothing to do with me.

27:45.500 --> 27:48.083
Oh, no, you're sorry.
For what?

27:48.166 --> 27:49.375
That the computers are down.

27:49.458 --> 27:51.667
Look, we're doing
the best we can.

27:51.750 --> 27:52.834
The hell you are!

27:55.583 --> 27:57.917
hell

27:58.000 --> 27:59.083
This whole damn system

27:59.166 --> 28:01.333
doesn't

28:02.500 --> 28:04.667
Your best isn't good enough.

28:15.333 --> 28:19.375
That's victim number two,
physician's assistant at
County.

28:19.458 --> 28:20.834
Roderick Poole.

28:20.917 --> 28:23.375
Sophia was too far along.

28:25.166 --> 28:28.583
She passed six months later.

28:28.667 --> 28:30.875
When did Alessandro leave?

28:31.000 --> 28:32.125
I left him.

28:36.542 --> 28:40.125
When our daughter died,
our marriage died, too.

28:40.208 --> 28:42.000
(Scotty)
'Any idea where
he could've gone?'

28:44.041 --> 28:48.125
I always assumed he went to go
live with his brother Luciano.

28:48.208 --> 28:51.333
His brother. You know
where we can contact him?

28:51.417 --> 28:54.041
I'm sorry. It's, uh..

28:57.709 --> 28:59.417
It's just,
it's been a long time.

29:19.709 --> 29:21.583
What's the DA doing here?

29:21.667 --> 29:23.458
He called in the feds.

29:24.083 --> 29:25.375
The FBI's here?

29:25.458 --> 29:27.667
Oh, you just missed
the big press conference.

29:27.750 --> 29:30.834
DA announced a joint
task force with the
FBI.

29:30.917 --> 29:32.834
"Presently conducting
an investigation

29:32.917 --> 29:34.542
"to locate the whereabouts

29:34.625 --> 29:36.000
of the person of interest."

29:36.083 --> 29:38.834
"In cooperation with the
Philadelphia Police
Department."

29:38.917 --> 29:41.333
- 'Of course.'
- 'Forgot the best part.'

29:41.417 --> 29:42.709
(Scotty)
'"The task force has already'

29:42.792 --> 29:44.667
"collaborated to thwart
the bomber's attack

29:44.750 --> 29:47.000
on an intended target."

29:47.083 --> 29:49.000
- You're kidding me.
- Do you believe this?

29:49.083 --> 29:51.625
That info was restricted
to protect Luke Ross.

29:51.709 --> 29:52.834
Was.

29:52.917 --> 29:54.417
The boss already sent
Vera and Miller

29:54.500 --> 29:56.750
to beef up
the security detail.

30:10.208 --> 30:11.583
I talk to you?

30:13.834 --> 30:14.875
You brought the feds in?

30:14.959 --> 30:16.375
- No, my boss did.
- Yeah.

30:16.458 --> 30:18.000
And he just revealed
to the press

30:18.083 --> 30:20.291
that our bomber missed his
last
target. Thanks for that.

30:20.375 --> 30:21.542
Scotty, it's pretty clear

30:21.625 --> 30:22.834
you needed help
bringing this guy in.

30:22.917 --> 30:24.333
Now, that's a bunch of bull.

30:24.417 --> 30:26.834
- It's a joint task force.
- It's a joke.

30:26.917 --> 30:28.208
Look, the feds
don't share information

30:28.291 --> 30:29.417
they just take it.

30:29.500 --> 30:31.041
They're not on the ground,
doing the legwork

30:31.125 --> 30:32.291
dealing with the victims.

30:32.375 --> 30:33.834
You need to look at
the big picture, Scotty.

30:33.917 --> 30:35.750
Last I checked, this guy
is still out there.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.583
Look, where I come from

30:37.667 --> 30:39.000
we try not to turn witnesses..

30:39.083 --> 30:40.166
...into collateral damage.

30:40.250 --> 30:41.250
That's the big picture.

30:41.333 --> 30:43.333
My job is to put this guy away.

30:43.417 --> 30:45.166
That's not my problem.

30:50.500 --> 30:54.500
You know, if he goes back
to finish Ross now..

30:54.583 --> 30:56.375
...his blood's on your hands.

31:05.834 --> 31:08.583
I tracked down the name of the
bomber's brother on Accurint.

31:08.667 --> 31:13.417
Luciano Rossilini legally
changed his name back in '98.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.542
Luke Ross?

31:15.625 --> 31:17.291
Same guy he tried to kill?

31:17.375 --> 31:18.500
His own brother.

31:26.208 --> 31:27.583
long before
I changed it legally.

31:27.667 --> 31:29.583
What about your
last name,
Luciano

31:29.667 --> 31:30.792
that too Italian?

31:30.875 --> 31:32.375
Or you just
running
from something?

31:32.458 --> 31:34.333
In my line of work, it was
just easier to shorten it

31:34.417 --> 31:37.000
when I switched jobs.

31:37.083 --> 31:38.709
We think you knew
about it all along.

31:38.792 --> 31:40.959
That the man we've been
searching for was your
brother.

31:41.041 --> 31:43.125
- 'Alessandro.'
- What, that's ridiculous.

31:43.208 --> 31:46.667
Oh, come on, the harassing
phone call to your wife.

31:46.750 --> 31:48.125
Hmm. What he said.

31:48.208 --> 31:49.875
(Lilly)
'All he'd been
through, how angry'

31:49.959 --> 31:51.500
and bitter he'd become.

31:51.583 --> 31:54.458
Look, my brother..

31:54.542 --> 31:57.125
...has fallen on
some hard times of late

31:57.208 --> 31:58.458
but he's not a violent man.

31:58.542 --> 32:00.375
The bomb he left for you

32:00.458 --> 32:02.834
just blew off another man's arm.

32:02.917 --> 32:04.500
You got lucky this time, Luke.

32:04.583 --> 32:07.166
I admit we had a falling out.

32:08.792 --> 32:10.667
But he's still my brother.

32:10.750 --> 32:12.834
(Lilly)
'Look, you looked
up to him as a kid.'

32:12.917 --> 32:15.166
But your brother
needs help now, Luke.

32:21.917 --> 32:24.834
He was like a hero
to me growing up.

32:24.917 --> 32:27.375
(Luke)
'He had that job
and the house..'

32:27.458 --> 32:28.583
...beautiful family..

32:28.667 --> 32:31.041
But he lost it all.

32:31.917 --> 32:34.667
Got dealt some pretty raw blows.

32:34.750 --> 32:36.583
His whole world just fell apart.

32:37.875 --> 32:39.333
Do you know where he is now?

32:39.417 --> 32:41.000
Last time I saw him,
he was holed up

32:41.083 --> 32:42.542
in our parents' old house.

32:45.083 --> 32:46.542
Couldn't get him out.

32:48.291 --> 32:50.291
Sandro, we got to talk.

32:52.083 --> 32:53.792
(Luke)
'You got to get out, Sandro.'

32:53.875 --> 32:55.792
'They're coming to
tear the place down.'

32:55.875 --> 32:57.375
You have to let it go.

32:58.959 --> 33:00.875
(Alessandro)
Do I know you?

33:00.959 --> 33:02.875
I know things have been hard

33:02.959 --> 33:04.792
'what you've gone through.'

33:04.875 --> 33:07.083
You think you know
what I've been
through.

33:08.959 --> 33:10.208
I'm sorry.

33:10.291 --> 33:13.750
You don't know anything
about loss or sacrifice.

33:13.834 --> 33:15.750
But Dad knew.

33:15.834 --> 33:18.709
He was out of work when
he made us this music box

33:18.792 --> 33:20.375
for Sophia for Christmas.

33:20.458 --> 33:22.500
(Alessandro)
'Look at the detail.'

33:22.583 --> 33:25.083
- I remember.
- 'The craftsmanship.'

33:25.166 --> 33:27.125
'He found the time'

33:27.208 --> 33:31.041
to create things
of-of lasting value

33:31.125 --> 33:32.834
things with integrity.

33:32.917 --> 33:34.792
Dad had a lot
of pride in his work.

33:34.875 --> 33:38.917
Like the tile work at
the 20th Street station or..

33:39.000 --> 33:40.417
...the stonework on this house.

33:40.500 --> 33:43.542
This was, this was
our parents' dream.

33:43.625 --> 33:46.083
It's our legacy.

33:46.166 --> 33:47.917
Things change.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.583
Remember he always used to
tell us the story of John
Henry?

33:51.667 --> 33:52.917
He tried to warn us

33:53.000 --> 33:55.709
to work with our-our brains

33:55.792 --> 33:57.000
rather than our backs

33:57.083 --> 33:58.083
and so I did.

33:58.166 --> 33:59.333
'We both did.'

33:59.417 --> 34:01.875
'I got an education.'

34:01.959 --> 34:03.625
A job.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.083
I tried to do good work

34:05.166 --> 34:07.041
and in the end,
it just doesn't
matter.

34:07.125 --> 34:09.625
I'm disposable,
like everything is
now.

34:09.709 --> 34:12.291
And now you wanna let them

34:12.375 --> 34:13.875
tear down the street
that we grew up on

34:13.959 --> 34:16.125
so they can,
they can build, what?

34:16.208 --> 34:18.166
They can sell people, what?

34:18.250 --> 34:19.583
Crap, that nobody needs.

34:19.667 --> 34:20.750
The street's gone, Sandro.

34:20.834 --> 34:22.375
Not everything's meant
to last forever.

34:22.458 --> 34:25.000
So just give up
and let them have the house

34:25.083 --> 34:27.166
that I raised my daughter in?

34:27.250 --> 34:29.333
It's time to move on.

34:29.417 --> 34:31.208
Oh, you..

34:32.625 --> 34:33.667
You..

34:35.166 --> 34:39.083
...are perfect
for this world, little
brother.

34:39.166 --> 34:41.667
Making money off
the backs of others.

34:43.709 --> 34:45.125
You're going to have
to pay the mortgage

34:45.208 --> 34:47.417
'cause I'm not giving
you any more money.

34:49.542 --> 34:50.834
You're not my brother.

34:52.458 --> 34:54.750
Get out of my house.

35:05.083 --> 35:07.583
He stayed until
the bulldozers finally came.

35:10.083 --> 35:13.542
I don't know where
he went after that.

35:13.625 --> 35:15.041
He mentioned the train station

35:15.125 --> 35:17.000
the one your father worked on.

35:18.750 --> 35:21.500
It's the 20th Street station.

35:21.583 --> 35:23.667
My dad did the tile work there.

35:23.750 --> 35:26.208
The same station the call
came from the pay phone.

35:29.208 --> 35:30.750
(Scotty)
'They spotted him.'

35:30.834 --> 35:33.166
There's SWAT and bomb squad
en route, boss.

35:33.250 --> 35:35.208
Security camera at the station
picked him up on a bench.

35:35.291 --> 35:37.125
He hasn't moved in over an hour.

35:37.208 --> 35:38.917
I'll have them stop the
train lines, seal the
station.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.375
Have Vera and Miller
give Mr. Ross a ride back home.

35:41.458 --> 35:43.208
I'm coming with you.

35:43.291 --> 35:45.125
My brother's there.
He might talk to me.

35:47.250 --> 35:49.750
Get him a vest. Keep him behind
the shield in case we need him.

36:05.667 --> 36:07.208
He's got something
on his lap.

36:16.125 --> 36:18.083
- I'm gonna make an approach.
- Got it.

36:23.500 --> 36:25.917
Lieutenant Stillman,
Alessandro.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.208
Call me John.

36:28.834 --> 36:32.083
I used to come here
sometimes with my father and..

36:32.166 --> 36:34.583
...I would just sit here.

36:34.667 --> 36:36.125
It always calmed me.

36:38.750 --> 36:39.959
You father did beautiful work.

36:40.041 --> 36:41.583
That's when people
took pride in it

36:41.667 --> 36:43.709
when they built things to last.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.250
He always said it was
better to be the guy

36:47.333 --> 36:48.792
'who designed it, but..'

36:48.875 --> 36:50.625
...they don't even
do that anymore.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.875
He sounds like a man
of integrity.

36:52.959 --> 36:55.083
Who knew it'd all
come down to this?

36:55.166 --> 36:58.166
You did, Alessandro,
but you can stop it right
now.

36:58.250 --> 37:01.083
It never stops,
never stops, never, never.

37:01.166 --> 37:02.959
(Alessandro)
At first I
thought..

37:03.041 --> 37:05.083
...I'd gone mad.

37:05.166 --> 37:07.709
But then I realized
it wasn't me..

37:07.792 --> 37:10.166
...it's the world
that's gone mad.

37:10.250 --> 37:13.625
Everything that's happened,
all you lost..

37:13.709 --> 37:14.959
...you can't bring that back.

37:15.041 --> 37:17.917
You become numb, disconnected

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
'conditioned to accept every..'

37:20.083 --> 37:22.834
...every indignity.

37:22.917 --> 37:23.959
Disposable.

37:24.041 --> 37:25.875
Is that really
what this is all about?

37:25.959 --> 37:28.041
It's never anyone's fault.

37:28.125 --> 37:30.125
Never. "I'm just doing my job.

37:30.208 --> 37:32.583
It's not personal.
It's just business."

37:32.667 --> 37:35.417
(John)
'But it is personal, isn't
it?'

37:35.500 --> 37:36.709
When it's your family?

37:36.792 --> 37:40.834
People have to answer
for what they do.

37:40.917 --> 37:42.875
I gave them all
a chance again and again.

37:42.959 --> 37:44.792
Put the box down, Alessandro.

37:44.875 --> 37:49.208
(Alessandro)
'But you can only
get pushed down...so far..'

37:49.291 --> 37:51.667
...before you
have to stand up

37:51.750 --> 37:53.375
and tell them you have value.

37:58.375 --> 37:59.625
Curt?

38:06.500 --> 38:07.709
What's the problem now, sir?

38:07.792 --> 38:10.000
The problem is that
this thing doesn't
work.

38:10.083 --> 38:12.583
- What is it?
- 'It's a shower radio.'

38:12.667 --> 38:13.625
Do you have a receipt?

38:13.709 --> 38:16.000
- Yeah.
- What's wrong with it?

38:16.083 --> 38:18.875
As soon as it got
wet,
the radio broke.

38:18.959 --> 38:21.375
Piece of crap, huh?

38:21.458 --> 38:22.625
What did you say?

38:25.250 --> 38:27.792
I'm sorry,
but it's after 30 days.

38:27.875 --> 38:29.125
So-so what?

38:29.208 --> 38:30.875
So we can't accept
any returns after 30 days

38:30.959 --> 38:32.875
unless you purchased
an in-store extended warranty.

38:32.959 --> 38:35.166
- You must be joking.
- I wish I was.

38:35.250 --> 38:36.709
You can send it back
to the manufacturer.

38:36.792 --> 38:37.875
It's still under their warranty.

38:37.959 --> 38:39.208
To where, Taiwan?

38:39.291 --> 38:41.208
I mean, it would cost me
more to ship it

38:41.291 --> 38:44.000
'there than what it's worth.'

38:44.083 --> 38:46.333
I'm sorry, sir.
Uh, next in line.

38:46.417 --> 38:47.542
No, no, just a minute,
just a minute.

38:47.625 --> 38:49.625
No, see,
if you were truly sorry

38:49.709 --> 38:50.875
you would stand by the product

38:50.959 --> 38:52.333
and just give me my money back.

38:52.417 --> 38:55.500
- I don't make the rules,
sir.
- So that's it?

38:55.583 --> 38:58.375
(Alessandro)
'Just send it back
to the manufacturer?'

38:58.458 --> 39:01.583
You're sure that this is
the way you want to handle
this?

39:01.667 --> 39:03.542
Look, man, you're right

39:03.625 --> 39:05.208
it's going to cost
you less just to toss it

39:05.291 --> 39:07.667
and buy a new one.

39:07.750 --> 39:09.959
What the hell kind
of product is that?

39:10.041 --> 39:11.583
Disposable.

39:11.667 --> 39:13.583
I'm sorry you feel that way.

39:15.291 --> 39:18.083
I'm sorry, sir,
I can't help you.

39:18.166 --> 39:19.750
Then I can't help you.

39:22.083 --> 39:23.166
Next in line.

39:32.125 --> 39:34.583
Sometimes you have
to wake people up.

39:34.667 --> 39:37.250
Make them realize how
we've all been diminished.

39:37.333 --> 39:40.417
- Even the innocent?
- No one's innocent. No one.

39:40.500 --> 39:42.166
We're all,
we're all complicit in
this..

39:42.250 --> 39:43.959
...in this mess.

39:44.041 --> 39:46.792
People need to be made..

39:46.875 --> 39:48.250
...to understand..

39:48.333 --> 39:49.625
About loss.

39:51.208 --> 39:53.417
You used to bring
your daughter here.

39:53.500 --> 39:55.542
Isn't that really
what this is about?

39:57.166 --> 39:58.500
All the blame..

39:58.583 --> 40:01.208
'...clinging to
everything in the past?'

40:01.291 --> 40:02.875
People expect you to move on.

40:02.959 --> 40:04.959
Yeah, but you can't.

40:05.041 --> 40:07.458
It's not natural
to outlive your own child.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.667
But you can't
destroy this place.

40:11.750 --> 40:13.125
'All your father built.'

40:13.208 --> 40:16.291
No, I would never do that.

40:25.750 --> 40:27.625
It's not there.

40:27.709 --> 40:29.041
The bomb's not there.

40:39.583 --> 40:41.583
But nothing lasts forever.

40:43.834 --> 40:46.750
[phone ringing]
Mom, mom, I got
to show you something.

40:48.083 --> 40:49.542
Hello.

40:49.625 --> 40:51.709
Oh, hi, mom. No, we're fine.

40:51.792 --> 40:54.875
Mom, I got the coolest thing
at school day in my cubby.
Look.

40:58.333 --> 41:00.208
Where's your wife now?

41:00.291 --> 41:01.834
Picking up Mia from school.

41:01.917 --> 41:03.083
She should be home by now.

41:05.750 --> 41:06.959
What's going on?

41:08.667 --> 41:09.875
(Beth)
'It's okay, mom.'

41:09.959 --> 41:11.083
We have police watching us

41:11.166 --> 41:12.333
wherever we go.

41:16.291 --> 41:17.583
Vera, answer damn it.

41:22.166 --> 41:24.417
- Yeah.
- Get them out of the house.

41:46.834 --> 41:48.750
How could you do this?

41:48.834 --> 41:50.709
(Alessandro)
'How could you do this?'

41:51.500 --> 41:53.041
'How could you do this?'

44:24.917 --> 44:26.208
