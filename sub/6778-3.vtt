01:47.170 --> 01:48.637
GUPTA, SANDEEP.

01:48.740 --> 01:50.002
NO INDIAN PEOPLE.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.203
WE'RE GONNA GET
IN TROUBLE, YOU GUYS.

01:52.310 --> 01:53.470
WE SHOULD
STOP DOING THIS.

01:53.580 --> 01:56.071
HOW ABOUT

01:56.180 --> 01:57.977

02:03.590 --> 02:07.811

02:11.530 --> 02:12.451
HELLO ?

02:12.560 --> 02:14.391
( female )
Hi, is Gerald there ?

02:14.500 --> 02:16.058
WHAT TIME IS IT,

02:16.170 --> 02:18.195
UM, HE'LL KNOW.

02:18.300 --> 02:20.734
Honey, wake up.

02:20.840 --> 02:22.091
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

02:22.210 --> 02:25.429

02:25.540 --> 02:27.201
Tell him...

02:27.310 --> 02:29.107

02:29.210 --> 02:31.906
EXCUSE ME ?

02:32.010 --> 02:33.147
WHAT IS IT,
HONEY ?

02:33.250 --> 02:34.649
HANG UP !

02:34.750 --> 02:35.978
PUT IT ON SPEAKER !

02:36.080 --> 02:37.581
There's a woman
on the phone

02:37.690 --> 02:42.013
AND SHE SAYS THAT YOU LEFI'
YOUR UNDERWEAR AT HER HOUSE ?

02:42.120 --> 02:43.929
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

02:44.030 --> 02:45.281
GODDAMN IT, GERALD !

02:45.390 --> 02:48.223
I COULD KILL YOU, GERRY,
WHAT DID YOU DO ?

02:48.330 --> 02:49.763
( laughing )

02:49.870 --> 02:51.690
HANG UP, ASHLEY,
I'M DYING !

02:51.800 --> 02:54.792
OH, JESUS.

02:54.900 --> 02:56.128
WHAT IS IT ?

02:56.240 --> 02:57.605
IT'S JUST KIDS.

02:57.710 --> 03:00.008
I'M GONNA CALL THE POLICE,
I'VE GOT CALLER I.D.,

03:00.110 --> 03:01.600

03:01.710 --> 03:04.349

03:06.820 --> 03:08.742
KAITLIN.

03:11.920 --> 03:13.854

03:23.400 --> 03:25.721
MRS. STOLTE !

03:25.830 --> 03:29.607
I AM SO, SO SORRY.

03:34.110 --> 03:35.407
CANCER ?

03:35.510 --> 03:36.579
YES.

03:37.110 --> 03:38.941
YES, CANCER.

03:42.050 --> 03:43.813
I'M HERE.

03:43.920 --> 03:46.650
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.614
OKAY, BE'I'I'ER.

03:48.720 --> 03:50.824
BUT USE "WE'RE HERE"
NOT "I'M HERE."

03:50.930 --> 03:51.885
YOU'RE NOT
THEIR FRIEND.

03:51.990 --> 03:53.526
AND EASY ON
THE TOUCHING.

03:53.630 --> 03:56.121
EVEN FUNERAL DIRECTORS HAVE
TO BEWARE OF TRANSFERENCE.

03:56.230 --> 03:58.494
DAVID, YOU ARE,
QUITE SIMPLY PUT,

03:58.600 --> 04:00.898
THE BEST
I'VE EVER WORKED WITH.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.902
ARTHUR, I'M THE ONLY ONE
YOU'VE EVER WORKED WITH.

04:05.010 --> 04:06.932
( doorbell )

04:07.040 --> 04:09.349
OKAY.

04:11.050 --> 04:12.847
THIS ONE'S ALL YOU.

04:13.620 --> 04:15.315
YES, SIR.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.655
SOMETHING YOUTHFUL,
SOMETHING WHITE.

04:23.760 --> 04:27.127
PERHAPS WHITE
WITH HER FAVORITE COLOR.

04:27.230 --> 04:29.528
HER FAVORITE COLOR
IS LIGHT BLUE.

04:29.630 --> 04:31.120
I THOUGHT
IT WAS PURPLE.

04:31.230 --> 04:33.095
IT USED
TO BE PURPLE.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.339
THIS YEAR IT
CHANGED TO LIGHT BLUE.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.629
SKY BLUE.

04:40.140 --> 04:42.745
SHE'S ONLY 14.

04:43.780 --> 04:45.441
THAT IS SO YOUNG.

04:46.110 --> 04:47.179
IT IS.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.419
IT IS SO YOUNG.

04:50.720 --> 04:53.609
MIGHT I SUGGEST WHITE WITH
A PERIWINKLE SILK LINING ?

04:53.720 --> 04:57.258
PERIWINKLE IS RT OF IN BETWEEN
PURPLE AND LIGHT BLUE.

04:57.360 --> 04:59.225
I THINK SHE
MIGHT LIKE THAT.

04:59.330 --> 05:01.025
SHE WOULD
LIKE THAT.

05:01.130 --> 05:02.563
THAT'S GOOD.

05:02.670 --> 05:03.864
OKAY.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.221
THAT'S ALL
WE NEED FOR NOW.

05:05.330 --> 05:06.866
I'LL SEND PHOTOS
OVER LATER.

05:06.970 --> 05:09.268
WE DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE
SUPPOSED TO BRING PHOTOS.

05:09.370 --> 05:11.861
OF COURSE NOT,
HOW COULD YOU.

05:11.970 --> 05:14.438
I'LL SEE YOU OUT.

05:15.980 --> 05:17.948
( sobbing )

05:25.150 --> 05:27.812
CLAIRE, COULD YOU
COME GET THIS ?

05:33.060 --> 05:33.924
NICE.

05:34.030 --> 05:35.292
PEOPLE COLLECT THOSE.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.799
IT'S KIND OF RACIST.

05:36.900 --> 05:39.164
THAT'S WHY I PUT IT WAY
UP THERE BACK IN THE '60s.

05:39.270 --> 05:43.900
JUST PUT IT WITH ALL THE OTHER
THINGS IN THAT PILE OVER THERE.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.864
DID YOU START MAKING PILES
IN YOUR ROOM YET ?

05:45.970 --> 05:48.700
UM, I STILL HAVE TO GO
THROUGH SOME OLD PILES,

05:48.810 --> 05:50.573
THEN I'LL START
MAKING SOME NEW ONES.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.819
I'VE MADE A SCHEDULE
FOR THE GARAGE SALE.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.241
I THOUGHT, IF WE PUT
A PLAN IN PLACE,

05:55.350 --> 05:57.545
WE'LL BE FREE
TO DEVIATE.

05:57.650 --> 05:59.857
AS LONG AS WE'RE
FREE TO DEVIATE.

06:04.960 --> 06:08.851
SO, ARE WE JUST
SELLING OUR STUFF TO
MAKE ROOM FOR GEORGE ?

06:08.960 --> 06:10.928
OR IS HE GONNA GET RID
OF SOME OF HIS STUFF TOO ?

06:11.030 --> 06:14.136
LIKE PERHAPS HIS TUPPERWARE
THING FULL OF SHIT ?

06:14.240 --> 06:16.333
SORRY, WHAT ARE
WE CALLING IT ?

06:16.440 --> 06:17.759
WE'RE NOT
CALLING IT ANYTHING.

06:17.870 --> 06:18.905
IT'S LONG GONE.

06:19.010 --> 06:20.500
THERE ARE A LOT
OF THINGS IN THIS HOUSE

06:20.610 --> 06:21.702
THAT AREN'T EVEN MINE.

06:21.810 --> 06:23.778
LIKE THAT
MAMMY COOKIE JAR.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.245
THAT COMES FROM
YOUR FATHER'S SIDE.

06:25.350 --> 06:27.568
A LOT OF STUFF
NEEDS TO JUST GO.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.581
I'D PERSONALLY PREFER IT
IF PEOPLE COULD JUST

06:30.690 --> 06:33.056
COME UPSTAIRS AND LIKE,
BID ON MY ENTIRE ROOM.

06:33.160 --> 06:36.015
AND I'M SURE NATE HAS A FEW
THINGS HE PROBABLY DOESN'T NEED

06:36.120 --> 06:39.157
TO HAVE AROUND.

06:40.360 --> 06:41.497
HMM.

06:41.960 --> 06:42.722
AH.

06:42.830 --> 06:44.092
AH.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.724
MONKEY.
MONKEY.

06:45.830 --> 06:48.560
I HAVE TO SAY, I'M CRAZY
ABOUT THE NEW RANGE ROVERS.

06:48.670 --> 06:51.662
YOU CAN'T DRIVE AN SUV THESE
DAYS WITH A STRAIGHT FACE.

06:51.770 --> 06:52.702
EXACTLY.

06:52.810 --> 06:54.175
I DON'T SEE
ANOTHER WAY THOUGH.

06:54.280 --> 06:55.133
CERTAINLY NOT
A MINIVAN--

06:55.240 --> 06:57.049
OH NO, FUCK THAT.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.300
( laughing )

06:59.410 --> 07:03.187
HEY, THERE'S THAT
POOR GUY WHOSE WIFE DROWNED.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.884
I KNOW, THAT IS SO SAD.

07:05.990 --> 07:08.618
HE'S HOT THOUGH, HUH ?

07:08.720 --> 07:10.256
SHHH.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.055
HEY.

07:12.160 --> 07:13.752
HI.

07:13.860 --> 07:15.054
HI.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.468
HOW ARE YOU TWO ?

07:16.570 --> 07:18.094
WE ARE FINE,
THANK YOU.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.065
YOU'RE NATE,
RIGHT ?

07:20.170 --> 07:21.137
RIGHT.

07:21.240 --> 07:22.332
I'M MADELINE.
MADELINE, HI.

07:22.440 --> 07:24.169
THIS IS LINDA.

07:24.270 --> 07:26.033
HI.
HI, HOW ARE YOU ?

07:26.140 --> 07:27.903

07:28.010 --> 07:30.240
HELLO, MAYA...

07:30.350 --> 07:33.376
YOU WANT TO
GET DOWN AND PLAY ?

07:33.480 --> 07:36.278
ALRIGHT.

07:36.380 --> 07:38.610
THERE YOU GO.

07:43.060 --> 07:43.856
ALRIGHT.

07:43.960 --> 07:45.029
( laughing )

07:49.130 --> 07:51.121
HEY, YOU GUYS GOING
TO JIMMY'S THING TONIGHT ?

07:51.230 --> 07:52.788
I'M SO SICK OF
JIMMY'S THINGS.

07:52.900 --> 07:55.937
I ACTUALLY THINK
WE'RE NOT GOING.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.531
WELL, WE'RE ALL GOING.

07:58.640 --> 08:01.234
IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S
ANYTHING BE'I'I'ER TO DO.

08:01.340 --> 08:02.648
WHAT TIME ARE
YOU GUYS GETTING THERE ?

08:02.750 --> 08:04.377
DON'T FORGET
ABOUT THAT THING...

08:04.480 --> 08:05.572
IN CHINATOWN.

08:05.680 --> 08:07.216
WE SHOULD
GO TO THAT.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.742
MAYBE WE CAN
GO THERE FIRST

08:08.850 --> 08:10.818
AND THEN GET
TO JIMMY'S AT LIKE 10.

08:10.920 --> 08:11.614
EXCELLENT, GOOD.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.381
I WILL
SEE YOU THERE.

08:13.490 --> 08:14.912
NOT GOING.

08:17.790 --> 08:20.395
GOD, THAT MOUSTACHE
IS REPULSIVE.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.821
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I LOVED HIM.

08:22.930 --> 08:26.388
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE JUST FRIENDS.

08:26.500 --> 08:29.196
NO, HE WAS LIKE
MY SERIOUS BOYFRIEND

08:29.300 --> 08:31.200
LIKE ALL OF
FRESHMAN YEAR.

08:31.310 --> 08:33.039
I COULD HAVE
SWORN HE WAS GAY.

08:33.140 --> 08:35.176
HE'S KNITTING.

08:35.280 --> 08:36.542
HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED ?

08:36.650 --> 08:38.106
A LOT OF STRAIGHT GUYS
KNIT THESE DAYS.

08:38.210 --> 08:40.713
IT'S LIKE A MACHO THING, LIKE,
I'M SO STRAIGHT I CAN EVEN KNIT.

08:40.820 --> 08:44.278
OH, OKAY, SO HE'S
ACTUALLY NOT GAY ?

08:44.390 --> 08:46.756
DON'T EVEN ASK ME.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.657
AT THE TIME HE HAD LIKE,
SEVERE BI-CURIOUS ISSUES.

08:48.760 --> 08:52.423
WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO GO
TO JIMMY'S THING ?

08:52.530 --> 08:55.090
HE'S LIKE
THE MATTHEW BARNEY
OF LAC-ARTS.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.418
OH, RIGHT, HE WISHES.

08:57.530 --> 09:00.169
I ALREADY TOLD EDIE
WE WERE GOING.

09:00.270 --> 09:02.534
SHE'S GOING ?

09:02.640 --> 09:04.767
OH YEAH, SHE'S ALWAYS
AT HIS THINGS.

09:04.870 --> 09:06.770
HMM.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.338
* THE WHEELS ON THE BUS
GO ROUND AND ROUND *

09:10.450 --> 09:13.840
* ROUND AND ROUND
ROUND AND ROUND *

09:13.950 --> 09:17.215
* THE WHEELS ON THE BUS
GO ROUND AND ROUND *

09:17.320 --> 09:20.687
* ALL THROUGH THE TOWN

09:20.790 --> 09:24.226
* THE DRIVER ON THE BUS
GOES MOVE ON BACK *

09:24.330 --> 09:27.857
( music )

09:27.960 --> 09:30.099
NOT BAD.

09:30.200 --> 09:34.239
OKAY, IF JESSICA SIMPSON
IS THE POOR MAN'S BRITNEY,

09:34.340 --> 09:35.432
WHAT'S CELESTE ?

09:35.540 --> 09:37.201
MAYBE A THINKING
MAN'S BRITNEY.

09:37.310 --> 09:40.006
HER MUSIC IS SUPPOSED TO BE
INSPIRATIONAL TO YOUNG GIRLS,

09:40.110 --> 09:42.203
I'M NOT JUST AN OBJECT,
I AM SOMEBODY.

09:42.310 --> 09:43.607
OH, LIKE CHRISTINA.

09:43.710 --> 09:45.302
YEAH, LIKE CHRISTINA,
BUT WITHOUT THE ASS

09:45.410 --> 09:47.116
HANGING OUT OF
THE CHAPS.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.539
GOT IT.

09:48.650 --> 09:50.948
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOUR ASS
HANGING OUT OF SOME CHAPS.

09:51.050 --> 09:52.688
OKAY, NEVER.

09:52.790 --> 09:54.109
YOU KNOW
I HATE THAT SHIT.

09:54.220 --> 09:57.348
SO DO YOU GET TO MEET
CELESTE TOMORROW ?

09:57.460 --> 09:58.984
NAH, I'M LIKE THIRD
LINE OF DEFENSE.

09:59.090 --> 10:00.751
YOU DON'T GET
TO MEET THE BIG STARS

10:00.860 --> 10:02.157
UNTIL YOU'VE PROVEN
YOU'RE NOT A FREAK.

10:02.260 --> 10:03.989
REMEMBER CAMERON DIAZ ?

10:04.100 --> 10:08.332
DEFINITELY DO NOT DO THAT
IN FRONT OF CELESTE.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.499
OR ANY OF
CELESTE'S PEOPLE.

10:10.610 --> 10:11.668
OKAY, FREAK.

10:11.770 --> 10:14.933
( singing along )

10:15.040 --> 10:18.203
* YOU COULD BE THE ONE
SHAVE MY LEGS FOR FREE *

10:18.310 --> 10:19.538
"SHAVE MY LEGS FOR FREE ?"

10:19.650 --> 10:21.208
I DON'T THINK
THOSE ARE THE WORDS.

10:21.320 --> 10:25.245
* YOU COULD BE THE ONE
TO SHAVE MY LEGS FOR FREE *

10:25.350 --> 10:28.786
( singing )

10:34.000 --> 10:35.353
CONDOM.

10:39.100 --> 10:40.829
( laughing )

10:44.040 --> 10:46.099
C'MON, C'MON.

10:47.580 --> 10:48.877
YOU GOT IT ?

10:51.650 --> 10:52.503
OKAY ?

10:52.610 --> 10:56.011
ALMOST, ALMOST--

10:59.520 --> 11:02.387
WAIT A SECOND.

11:05.930 --> 11:07.625
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF IT...

11:07.730 --> 11:09.698
I HATE THESE THINGS.

11:23.410 --> 11:24.399
LET'S JUST...
DO SOMETHING ELSE.

11:24.510 --> 11:25.545
LET ME JUST
MAKE YOU COME--

11:25.650 --> 11:27.538
NO, I WANT
TO MAKE YOU COME.

11:27.650 --> 11:29.345
NO, AND THEN THERE'S
THIS EXPECTATION,

11:29.450 --> 11:31.042
AND I HATE
EXPECTATIONS.

11:31.820 --> 11:34.414
JUST LET ME TRY.

11:34.520 --> 11:37.387
I DON'T
WANT TO TRY.

11:37.490 --> 11:39.526
NOW, HERE...

11:39.630 --> 11:43.168
JUST LAY DOWN...

11:43.270 --> 11:44.567
YEAH.

11:44.670 --> 11:47.138
LAY BACK...

11:49.100 --> 11:50.931
AND SHUSH.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.169
( laughing )

12:07.060 --> 12:09.358
I CAN'T GET RID OF
THIS GOOFY SMILE.

12:09.460 --> 12:13.123
BUT IF I CAN GET THIS RIGHT
I THINK I CAN BRING HER LIPS

12:13.230 --> 12:14.299
DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.527
MAY I ASK WHAT TECHNIQUE
YOU'LL BE EMPLOYING ?

12:16.630 --> 12:17.824
YES.

12:17.930 --> 12:19.329
IT'S CALLED
A FU LL-MACKEW.

12:19.430 --> 12:21.796
AS YOU CAN SEE, I'VE ALREADY
THREADED LIGATURE THROUGH HER

12:21.900 --> 12:23.128
NASAL CARTILAGE.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.128
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
CALLED A HALF-MACKEW ?

12:25.240 --> 12:27.572
IF I'D STOPPED THERE, IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN A HALF-MACKEW.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.170
BUT WATCH.

12:29.280 --> 12:33.273
I'M GOING DOWNWARD
THROUGH HER GUM LINE HERE,

12:33.380 --> 12:37.248
AND USING THE JAWBONE TO ANCHOR
THE THREAD BEFORE I TIE IT OFF.

12:37.350 --> 12:40.558
FASCINATING.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.355
MMM-HMM.

12:42.460 --> 12:44.087
ARTHUR,
YOU READY TO GO ?

12:44.190 --> 12:46.556
FEDERICO, IF IT'S
ALRIGHT WITH YOU,

12:46.660 --> 12:49.220
I'LL RETURN IN APPROXIMATELY
ONE AND ONE HALF HOURS.

12:49.330 --> 12:52.128
MAYBE A LITTLE WHILE LONGER IF
WE DECIDE TO GET LUNCH AFTER.

12:52.230 --> 12:55.393
I'LL WASH UP,
AND MEET YOU IN THE FOYER.

12:58.040 --> 13:00.304
YOU GUYS ARE
GETTING LUNCH ?

13:00.410 --> 13:01.809
SHOPPING,
THEN LUNCH.

13:01.910 --> 13:04.401
WOW, SHOPPING ?

13:04.510 --> 13:05.943
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO JOIN US ?

13:06.050 --> 13:08.018
NO, NO, I HAVE
WORK TO DO.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.884
THIS ONE WON'T
STOP SMILING.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.912
I WISH I KNEW WHAT
THE FUCK WAS SO FUNNY.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.994
HELLO ?

13:26.130 --> 13:28.269
OH, HEY.

13:28.370 --> 13:30.167
HI, COME ON IN.

13:30.270 --> 13:31.532

13:31.640 --> 13:32.709
SU AMIGA IS HERE !

13:32.810 --> 13:34.539
HEY, MAYA, HI.

13:34.640 --> 13:37.370
HEY, IF SHE WANTS TO GO AND
PLAY, YOU CAN JUST LET HER GO.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.107
OH, I--

13:39.210 --> 13:40.848
SHE HASN'T REALLY PLAYED
WITH THAT MANY KIDS YET.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.986
OH, WELL, AT THIS AGE,
THEY PLAY NEXT TO EACH OTHER.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.489
NOT WITH EACH OTHER.

13:44.590 --> 13:45.909
IT'S CALLED
PARALLEL PLAY.

13:46.020 --> 13:47.487
YOU WANT
TO GET DOWN ?

13:47.590 --> 13:48.750
YOU WANNA GO PLAY ?

13:48.860 --> 13:51.579
THERE YOU GO,
GO AHEAD.

13:51.690 --> 13:53.590
OH, HERE,
I'LL TAKE THAT.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.190
UM, GLADYS !

13:55.300 --> 13:58.292
VAMOS A ESTAR ALLA PARA
UN MOMENTITO, OKAY ?

13:58.400 --> 13:59.492
OKAY, MRS. MADELINE.

13:59.600 --> 14:00.897
COME, MIJA.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.865
SU MOMMY VAS A JUGAR
CON SU AMIGO

14:02.970 --> 14:04.858
DONDE TU JUGAR
CON SU AMIGA.

14:04.970 --> 14:07.109
SO, UM, YOU WANT
A SMOOTHIE ?

14:07.710 --> 14:10.702
UH, SURE, SURE.

14:10.810 --> 14:13.870
( Gladys )
YOU WANT TO PLAY
WITH THE MONKEY ?

14:31.270 --> 14:33.295
MUST BE A LATE
WEDDING PRESENT.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.137
THE CARD SAYS,

14:35.240 --> 14:37.265
"TO MR. AND MRS.
GEORGE SIBLEY !"

14:37.370 --> 14:39.804
I LIKE THE SOUND
OF THAT, MRS. GEORGE--

14:39.910 --> 14:41.901
OH, DEAR.

14:42.010 --> 14:43.648
WHAT DID WE GET ?

14:43.750 --> 14:46.275
EW, WHAT'S
THAT SMELL ?

14:46.380 --> 14:49.440
IT APPEARS TO BE
EXCREMENT AGAIN.

14:49.550 --> 14:51.415
NO WAY.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.385
EXCEPT THIS TIME SOMEONE
WENT TO THE TROUBLE

14:53.490 --> 14:55.617
TO PLACE ONE INSIDE
A DECORATIVE TIN.

14:57.060 --> 14:59.528
"TO MR. AND MRS.
GEORGE SIBLEY."

14:59.630 --> 15:02.827
HMM, NO SIGNATURE,
IMAGINE THAT.

15:02.930 --> 15:05.091
THIS IS A CATASTROPHE
OF THE HIGHEST ORDER.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.737
THIS INVOLVES
BOTH OF US NOW !

15:07.840 --> 15:10.263
WHO KNOWS
YOU LIVE HERE ?

15:11.340 --> 15:13.433
WHY DON'T YOU
CARE ABOUT THIS ?

15:13.540 --> 15:16.179
I'VE MADE A LOT OF ENEMIES
THROUGH THE YEARS, RUTH.

15:16.280 --> 15:18.271
YOU TAKE THE BACK-STABBING
WORLD OF ACADEMIA,

15:18.380 --> 15:20.541
THROW IN A CONTROVERSIAL
FIELD LIKE GEOLOGY,

15:20.650 --> 15:22.208
YOU'VE GOT
REAL TROUBLE.

15:22.320 --> 15:24.584
GEOLOGY IS
CONTROVERSIAL ?

15:24.690 --> 15:25.816
OIL, CLAIRE.

15:25.920 --> 15:27.353
OIL.

15:27.460 --> 15:28.518
LOOK.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.554
THIS IS FROM A PERSON
WHO QUITE OBVIOUSLY

15:30.660 --> 15:32.150
IS LOOKING
FOR A REACTION.

15:32.260 --> 15:34.057
SOMEBODY WHO NEEDS ATTENTION,
LET'S NOT GIVE IT TO HIM.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.252
THAT PERSON
ISN'T IN THE ROOM.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.794
HE CAN'T
SEE MY REACTION.

15:37.900 --> 15:39.060
THAT'S A GOOD POINT, MOM.

15:39.170 --> 15:41.491
MAYBE IT'S ONE OF
YOUR MOTHER'S OLD LOVERS.

15:41.600 --> 15:42.532
MY LOVERS ?

15:42.640 --> 15:44.528
THE GREEK ONE.

15:44.640 --> 15:46.369
HE WAS RUSSIAN.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.473
ARE YOU LEAVING,
CLAIRE ?

15:50.580 --> 15:51.877
YEAH.

15:51.980 --> 15:53.072
TOSS THIS IN THE DUMPSTER,
THEN, WOULD YOU ?

15:53.180 --> 15:56.980
OH, I THINK I'LL LET YOU
DO THAT, GEORGE.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.687
OH, LORD.

16:06.790 --> 16:08.621
PUT BACK TO ME.

16:08.730 --> 16:10.197
I LIKE YOU
IN BROWN.

16:10.300 --> 16:13.235
IS THIS BROWN
OR IS THIS GRAY ?

16:13.340 --> 16:14.967
SHARCA.

16:15.070 --> 16:16.264
SEE, CHOCOLATE.

16:16.370 --> 16:18.531
I THOUGHT
HE SAID CHARCOAL.

16:18.640 --> 16:20.528
SHARCA.

16:20.640 --> 16:23.575
OKAY, TAKE OFF NOW.

16:28.050 --> 16:29.278
WHAT'D YOU FIND ?

16:29.380 --> 16:31.211
NORMALLY I'D NEVER
SHOP IN THE VALLEY,

16:31.320 --> 16:32.685
BUT THIS PLACE
AIN'T TOO BAD.

16:32.790 --> 16:34.655
THERE'S A WHOLE RACK OF
MARKED DOWN JIL SANDER.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.182
PLUS SOME
JOHN VARVATOS,

16:36.290 --> 16:38.588
HUGO BOSS AND A PAIR OF
PRADA SHOES FOR LIKE, $100.

16:39.890 --> 16:41.653
WHERE'S ARTHUR ?

16:41.760 --> 16:43.591
CHANGING.

16:43.700 --> 16:46.794
MAYBE WE SHOULD BUY HIM
A WHOLE NEW WARDROBE.

16:46.900 --> 16:47.935
DO THEY EVER
DO THAT ?

16:48.040 --> 16:49.996
QUEER EYE FOR
THE GAY GUY ?

16:50.110 --> 16:53.432
I DON'T THINK ARTHUR'S GAY,
I THINK HE'S "A".

16:53.540 --> 16:56.100
I DON'T KNOW, I THINK
ASEXUAL PEOPLE ARE ASEXUAL

16:56.210 --> 16:58.144
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANNA
COME OUT OF THE CLOSET.

16:59.350 --> 17:01.511
YOU REALLY THINK ARTHUR
MIGHT BE GAY ?

17:01.620 --> 17:02.848
UH, YEAH.

17:02.950 --> 17:04.679
AW.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.314
THAT BREAKS MY HEART.

17:06.420 --> 17:09.253
I'M GONNA GO TRY
A COUPLE OF THESE ON.

17:09.360 --> 17:12.181
YOU'D LOOK
GOOD IN THIS.

17:12.290 --> 17:14.224
DAVID, I NEED
NEW CLOTHES FOR WORK,

17:14.330 --> 17:16.321
NOT GAY SKI WEEKEND
AT MAMMOTH.

17:25.170 --> 17:27.035
I'M GONNA BUY YOU
THE SUIT, OKAY ?

17:27.140 --> 17:28.300
OH, NO.

17:28.410 --> 17:29.604
I COULDN'T POSSIBLY
LET YOU DO THAT.

17:29.710 --> 17:30.904
I WANT TO.

17:31.010 --> 17:32.705
BESIDES, IT'S
A BUSINESS EXPENSE.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.512
IF I HAD A FATHER,

17:36.620 --> 17:39.418
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING
HE'D DO FOR ME.

17:40.520 --> 17:42.750
OR EVEN
AN ELDER SIBLING.

17:42.860 --> 17:44.680
IT'S JUST A SUIT.

17:46.630 --> 17:47.551
HEY, NICOLE.

17:47.660 --> 17:49.651
YOU LIKE THE WAY
THIS SOUNDS, HUH ?

17:49.760 --> 17:52.228
BUT THE GUY GOES IF
I WANTED MY FOOD STAMPS

17:52.330 --> 17:53.490
I SHOULD HAVE
BEEN ON TIME,

17:53.600 --> 17:55.261
SO HE SAID I HAD
TO CALL THE SOCIAL WORKER,

17:55.370 --> 17:56.689
BUT SHE'S OUT
ALL WEEK.

17:56.800 --> 17:59.906
ANYWAY MY FRIEND'S HERE,
SO I'M GONNA GO RIGHT NOW.

18:00.010 --> 18:01.272
'BYE.

18:04.080 --> 18:06.207
WE SHOULD GET
NICOLE SOME TOYS.

18:06.310 --> 18:08.369
THAT TOP IS
KID SAFE.

18:08.480 --> 18:12.484
BUT YEAH, SHE NEEDS
SOME NEW TOYS.

18:12.590 --> 18:14.683
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU GOT FOOD STAMPS.

18:15.420 --> 18:16.409
YEAH.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.556
THEY'RE FROM BEFORE
I WAS WORKING AT THE CLUB.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.157
I CAN AFFORD FOOD
OF COURSE--

18:22.260 --> 18:23.488
IT'S JUST IF I GET
THE FOOD STAMPS

18:23.600 --> 18:26.592
THEN I CAN SAVE THE CASH
FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

18:29.540 --> 18:31.929
HEY, YOU OKAY ?

18:32.040 --> 18:34.577
I DON'T WANT
NICOLE TO SEE ME CRY.

18:41.750 --> 18:44.184
IT'S JUST I'M A LITTLE
FREAKED OUT LATELY

18:44.290 --> 18:46.611
BECAUSE I'M
COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED,

18:46.720 --> 18:50.178
I THINK IT'S
BECAUSE I HAVE LUPUS.

18:50.290 --> 18:52.349
OH, SHIT,
ARE YOU SERIOUS ?

18:52.460 --> 18:55.520
IT'S CAUSED
BY LEAKING IMPLANTS.

18:55.630 --> 18:57.928
SERIOUSLY, I FEEL LIKE
ONE OF 'EM RUPTURED

18:58.030 --> 19:01.568
AND NOW THERE'S LIKE POISON
SILICONE ROAMING AROUND MY BODY.

19:02.740 --> 19:05.504
OH JEEZ.

19:07.410 --> 19:09.970
DID YOU
SEE A DOCTOR ?

19:10.080 --> 19:12.640
NOT YET, NOT YET.

19:12.750 --> 19:16.538
OH MY GOD, SOPHIA, HEY,
LISTEN, IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

19:16.650 --> 19:17.719
ALRIGHT ?

19:19.090 --> 19:21.581
MAYBE WE SHOULD,
MAYBE WE SHOULD PRAY ?

19:21.690 --> 19:24.056
RICO, I DON'T NEED PRAYER,
I NEED SURGERY !

19:24.160 --> 19:25.457
MEDICAL SURGERY !

19:25.560 --> 19:27.050
PLUS IF I GET ONE BOOB DONE,
THEY'RE NOT GONNA MATCH

19:27.160 --> 19:28.525
SO I HAVE TO GET THEM
BOTH RE-DONE,

19:28.630 --> 19:31.019
WHICH IS LIKE
FIVE GRAND...

19:31.130 --> 19:33.360
(crying )

19:33.470 --> 19:38.169
UNLESS YOU PUT THE PAYMENT PLAN,
WHICH IS LIKE $1,500 DEPOSIT.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.139
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
FOR THE MONEY.

19:48.250 --> 19:49.911
GOD, I SHOULD HAVE
NEVER TOLD YOU !

20:05.830 --> 20:08.628
IF I WERE TO GIVE YOU
THE $1,500 FOR THE DEPOSIT,

20:08.740 --> 20:13.473
DO YOU THINK THAT MAYBE YOU CAN,
YOU KNOW, PAY ME BACK ?

20:15.780 --> 20:20.649
I DON'T KNOW WHERE I COULD GET
$1,500 IN A CHUNK LIKE THAT.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.911
WELL, YOU COULD PAY ME BACK
WHATEVER YOU HAVE,

20:23.020 --> 20:24.578
WHEN EVER YOU
HAVE IT...

20:30.390 --> 20:32.483
I'LL JUST
GIVE YOU THE MONEY.

20:33.500 --> 20:37.891
OH MY GOD,
ARE YOU SERIOUS ?

20:39.200 --> 20:40.667
( laughing )

20:43.070 --> 20:45.504
MY ANGEL.

20:45.610 --> 20:48.602
NICOLE, GOD
SENT US AN ANGEL.

21:08.530 --> 21:10.418
YOU HAVE
A GREAT LIFE.

21:11.670 --> 21:13.126
THAN KS.

21:13.230 --> 21:15.391
DO I NEED
A COASTER ?

21:15.500 --> 21:18.037
NO, YOU CAN
PUT IT ANYWHERE.

21:18.140 --> 21:22.873
AH, OKAY, SO, THIS IS THE BOOK
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

21:22.980 --> 21:24.845
HIS NAME IS
THICH NHAT HAHN.

21:24.950 --> 21:30.741
AND HE SAYS THAT IT ALL STARTS
WITH LEARNING HOW TO BREATHE.

21:30.850 --> 21:34.980
SO, IF I READ THIS BOOK,
I'LL BE HAPPY ?

21:36.590 --> 21:38.285
IT'S NOT
THAT SIMPLE.

21:38.390 --> 21:40.051
( laughing )

21:42.060 --> 21:43.288
SO WHAT IS IT ?

21:43.400 --> 21:46.995
YOU SEEM TO BE HAPPY,
YOU OUGHTTA KNOW.

21:47.100 --> 21:49.432
OH, GOD, WELL...

21:50.510 --> 21:52.330
UM, I DON'T KNOW
I GUESS FOR ME,

21:52.440 --> 21:56.433
IT ALL STARTED WITH
MY DIVORCE, ACTUALLY.

21:56.540 --> 22:00.647
AND THEN, MAKING THE DECISION
TO BE A STAY-AT-HOME MOM.

22:00.750 --> 22:03.218
I MEAN IT'S HARD,
NOT WORKING.

22:03.320 --> 22:06.483
BUT I LOVE BEING
WITH JADEN, SO...

22:06.590 --> 22:09.559
WHEN SHE'S NOT
WITH HER NANNIES ?

22:09.660 --> 22:13.596
OKAY, ONE IS A NANNY AND
THE OTHER IS A HOUSEKEEPER.

22:13.700 --> 22:14.655
OKAY.

22:21.900 --> 22:26.769
SO THIS, IS THIS WHAT
YOU WANTED YOUR LIFE TO BE ?

22:26.870 --> 22:29.771
THIS IS ACTUALLY BETTER
THAN I EXPECTED.

22:32.610 --> 22:34.817
IT SMELLS
SO GOOD IN HERE.

22:38.990 --> 22:39.979
THICH NHAT HAHN.

22:40.090 --> 22:41.216

25:44.770 --> 25:47.876
I SHOULD KNOW IT MEANS
RED FLAG, RED FLAG !

25:47.980 --> 25:52.440

26:01.990 --> 26:05.949

MISANTHROPE THAN PARANOID.

27:47.360 --> 27:50.420
WHAT WE HAD WAS VERY SPECIAL,
BUT IT'S IN THE PAST.

27:50.530 --> 27:52.760
WE CAN'T CONTINUE
TO HOLD GRUDGES

27:52.870 --> 27:54.428
AND BE ANGRY
WITH ONE ANOTHER.

27:54.540 --> 27:56.496
I HOLD NO GRUDGES

28:12.820 --> 28:16.085

AN ACT SO HEINOUS ?

28:18.090 --> 28:20.797
YOU DON'T KNOW ME

28:20.900 --> 28:23.255
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
FRUSTRATED, ARTHUR,

28:23.360 --> 28:26.466
SITTING IDLY BY AS GEORGE

I'M HUMAN.

28:41.650 --> 28:44.915
AND I'M A MAN.

28:45.020 --> 28:48.057
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD KNOW THAT.

28:48.160 --> 28:51.049
BUT I WOULD NEVER SEND
THOSE THINGS TO YOU.

28:51.160 --> 28:53.378
I COULD NEVER

I WISH YOU COULD TOO.

29:07.910 --> 29:10.208
NOW I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE.

29:28.300 --> 29:29.858
( frogs croaking )

29:35.800 --> 29:39.429
* I KEEP MY BUTTERFLY CLOSE WHEN
YOU DON'T WANNA BE BOTHERED *

29:39.540 --> 29:43.738
* DON'T COME WAKING ME UP,
'CAUSE I AIN'T GIVING YOU NADA *

29:43.850 --> 29:47.911
* 'CAUSE I GOT ME A TOY
AND IT WORKS FOR ME *

29:48.020 --> 29:51.444
* AND IT LASTS LONGER
THAN THE BATTERY *

29:51.550 --> 29:53.188
* SO YOU BEST
BELIEVE THAT *

29:53.290 --> 29:56.214
* A TOY,

29:56.320 --> 29:58.720
* THE WAY

29:58.830 --> 30:02.152
* EVERY GIRL

30:02.260 --> 30:05.821

30:05.930 --> 30:07.568
THIS THE LINE ?

30:07.670 --> 30:09.092
YEAH.

30:09.200 --> 30:13.637
( moaning )

30:13.740 --> 30:16.174
* I USED TO WISH
THAT YOU WOULD LOVE ME *

30:16.280 --> 30:20.398
* AND FANTASIZE
ON HOW WE USED TO BE *

30:20.510 --> 30:25.538
* UNTIL I DISCOVERED
SOMETHING BETTER THAN YOU *

30:25.650 --> 30:30.553
* I DON'T NEED,
NO NEED... *

30:30.660 --> 30:32.719
SO, THIS COURSE I'M TAKING,
RECOVERY FROM MADNESS ?

30:32.830 --> 30:35.151
THE WOMAN WHO
TEACHES IT WAS ACTUALLY,

30:35.260 --> 30:36.750
OR IS BIPOLAR.

30:36.860 --> 30:39.363
DO YOU HAVE TO BE
BIPOLAR TO GET IN ?

30:39.470 --> 30:41.028
YEAH, IT HELPS.

30:41.140 --> 30:42.937
ANYWAY, SHE WROTE
THIS INCREDIBLE BOOK,

30:43.040 --> 30:46.066
EXPLAINING WHAT IT FEELS LIKE,
SHE'S KIND OF A PIONEER.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.130
OH.

30:49.240 --> 30:51.140
OH, HERE.

30:53.310 --> 30:54.538
THANK YOU.

30:54.650 --> 30:56.811
DON'T THANK ME.

30:56.920 --> 30:59.445
I COULD WAIT ON YOU
HAND AND FOOT ALL DAY.

30:59.550 --> 31:00.812
I'M SERIOUS.

31:00.920 --> 31:04.629
IT WOULD MAKE ME
A VERY HAPPY MAN.

31:04.730 --> 31:08.621
SO, YOU KNOW, LAST NIGHT WHEN
I WAS PUTTING ON THAT CONDOM--

31:08.730 --> 31:11.119
OH LISTEN, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO EXPLAIN.

31:11.230 --> 31:13.221
I SHOULD JUST GO BACK ON THE
PILL AND IT WON'T BE A PROBLEM.

31:13.330 --> 31:16.333
NO, NO, NO, NO, YOU KNOW,
I USED TO THINK THAT

31:16.440 --> 31:18.965
I HAD, LIKE, A PROBLEM
STAYING HARD OR WHATEVER.

31:19.070 --> 31:20.935
HEY, NO,
IT'S OKAY, REALLY.

31:21.040 --> 31:26.239
NO, THEN I REALIZED THAT
I'M TOTALLY HARD WHEN I--

31:26.350 --> 31:30.878
YOU KNOW LIKE
WHEN PEOPLE ROLE--

31:32.390 --> 31:35.359
I REALLY LIKE THAT DYNAMIC
WHEN LIKE ONE PERSON IS BOSS,

31:35.460 --> 31:39.123
AND THE OTHER PERSON IS
SORT OF LIKE MORE DOMINANT

31:39.230 --> 31:42.097
OR THE OTHER PERSON
IS A LITTLE MORE SUB--

31:42.200 --> 31:44.862
I'M NOT EXPLAINING
THIS VERY WELL.

31:44.970 --> 31:48.838
NO, YOU'RE
EXPLAINING IT FINE.

31:48.940 --> 31:50.362
IT'S ACT UALLY--

31:50.470 --> 31:52.006
YOU DON'T NEED
TO EXPLAIN IT ANYMORE.

31:52.110 --> 31:53.429
YOU KNOW, LOOK, I KNOW
EVERYONE HAS THEIR THING.

31:53.540 --> 31:56.429
I'VE KNOWN PROSTITUTES
AND DOMINATRIXES.

31:56.540 --> 31:58.303
I'VE BEEN TO SEX CLUBS
AND LEATHER CLUBS

31:58.410 --> 32:00.446
AND I'VE HEARD OF GUYS
WHO CAN ONLY CUM IF A GIRL IS,

32:00.550 --> 32:02.939
I DON'T KNOW,
SITTING ON A BALLOON,

32:03.050 --> 32:06.213
I WROTE THIS WHOLE EROTIC
NOVELLA ABOUT A GIRL WHO--

32:06.320 --> 32:11.758
I WAS HOPING THAT
WE COULD BE--

32:11.860 --> 32:12.827
WE CAN BE ANYTHING--

32:12.930 --> 32:15.125
I WAS HOPING THAT...

32:15.230 --> 32:18.165
WE...

32:18.270 --> 32:21.797
COULD HAVE NORMAL SEX.

32:21.900 --> 32:25.006
LIKE NORMAL SEX ?

32:25.110 --> 32:27.101
YEAH, NORMAL SEX.

32:27.210 --> 32:29.474

PEOPLE DO IT.

32:29.580 --> 32:31.878

32:31.980 --> 32:33.345
YEAH.

32:33.450 --> 32:34.917
THEY DON'T TURN IT
ALL INTO SOME FANTASY,

32:35.020 --> 32:37.147
OR GET DRUNK OR SMOKE POT
TO MAKE IT INTERESTING.

32:37.250 --> 32:39.241
WE CAN SMOKE POT,
I CAN GET POT--

32:39.350 --> 32:41.284
NO, I DON'T WANT
TO SMOKE POT.

32:41.390 --> 32:43.711
I SMOKED SO MUCH POT
IT WAS...

32:43.820 --> 32:47.278
IT MADE ME... ME.

32:47.390 --> 32:51.963
NOW ALL THOSE THINGS JUST
SEEM LIKE AN ESCAPE FROM SEX.

32:52.070 --> 32:57.565
ALRIGHT WELL, I'LL PUT SOME
THOUGHT INTO EXPLORING

32:57.670 --> 32:59.365
MY NORMAL SIDE.

32:59.470 --> 33:02.405
OH, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WAS SAYING.

33:02.510 --> 33:06.048
BUT ANYWAY, LOOK,
I SHOULD GO TO BED.

33:06.150 --> 33:09.313

38:56.630 --> 38:59.167
C'MON, THINK A LITTLE
HARDER THAN THAT.

38:59.270 --> 39:01.124

39:56.090 --> 39:57.409
THAT'S A PRETTY BLOUSE.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.727
THAT DOESN'T

39:59.830 --> 40:00.649

I KNOW THAT !

40:11.200 --> 40:12.758
WELL...

40:18.550 --> 40:21.815
IT'S LIKE MY BRAIN IS
ENCASED IN THIS FLUID

40:21.920 --> 40:25.481
AND IF I MOVE THEN THE FLUID
MOVES AND MY BRAIN KILLS.

40:25.590 --> 40:28.286
OR IT COULD
BE ENCEPHALITIS.

40:28.390 --> 40:30.950
HERE, TRY MY SODA.

40:31.060 --> 40:32.584

40:35.530 --> 40:38.499

40:40.470 --> 40:41.698
YEAH, HIS DADDY'S JUST
GONNA BUY SOME MORE JUNK

40:41.800 --> 40:44.439
AND WE'RE GONNA SPEND

40:47.510 --> 40:48.772
_Control Freaks
IS the movne.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.836
And Colin Farrell
who she's just friends with.

40:50.940 --> 40:54.444
I am, we're just friends,
he's really sweet though.

40:54.550 --> 40:55.847
Whatever you say.

40:55.950 --> 40:59.044
And so let's talk
a little bit about the CD.

40:59.150 --> 41:00.788
"Me Here Now".

41:00.890 --> 41:01.857
"Me Here Now".

41:01.960 --> 41:02.949
"Me Here Now".

41:03.060 --> 41:04.823
And is it Me comma,
Here comma, Now ?

41:04.930 --> 41:08.149
No, Me period,
Here period, Now.

41:08.260 --> 41:09.420
Exclamation.

41:09.530 --> 41:11.521
Exclamation,
it is strong.

41:11.630 --> 41:13.689
It's about me
being here right now.

41:13.800 --> 41:16.064
I mean, I want all my fans,
all the girls out there

41:16.170 --> 41:18.502
to know that the most important
thing is to be yourself

41:18.610 --> 41:20.362
and to be here...

41:20.470 --> 41:21.835
Now.

41:23.380 --> 41:24.540
That's right.

41:24.650 --> 41:26.470
And this is who
you are In the now.

41:26.580 --> 41:29.048
But if you were someone
different say yesterday

41:29.150 --> 41:32.313
or even tomorrow that's
still who you are, It's now.

41:32.420 --> 41:35.548
Although it was before
or maybe later,

41:35.660 --> 41:38.629
but it's you
in the then.

41:38.730 --> 41:41.381
Uh-huh, and it comes out
in two weeks.

41:41.490 --> 41:44.994
( moaning )

41:57.180 --> 42:00.570
( laughing )

42:04.150 --> 42:07.142
( heavy breathing )

42:08.990 --> 42:12.380
OH MY GOD,
CREEPY COLIN FARRELL

42:12.490 --> 42:13.650
JUST LEI-T ME ANOTHER
CREEPY MESSAGE,

42:13.760 --> 42:16.490
CAN'T WE DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT ?

42:16.600 --> 42:18.454
YOU KNOW, LEGALLY ?

42:18.570 --> 42:20.128
WELL, I GUESS--

42:20.230 --> 42:21.766
KEITH, DID YOU USE THE BATHROOM
IN CELESTE'S DRESSING ROOM ?

42:21.870 --> 42:25.431
YEAH, BUT THAT'S WHEN
SHE WAS DOING THE SHOW.

42:25.540 --> 42:27.405
NO ONE WAS AROUND
SO I THOUGHT--

42:27.510 --> 42:29.478
YEAH, DUDE,
IT'S NOT COOL, OKAY ?

42:29.580 --> 42:31.332
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

42:31.440 --> 42:34.147
YOU DO NOT USE
THE CLIENT'S CAN EVER.

42:34.250 --> 42:35.717
GOT IT.

42:40.020 --> 42:43.057
I THINK I KNOW WHO
SENT US THE, THE--

42:43.160 --> 42:44.980
THE SHIT ?

42:45.090 --> 42:46.079
YES, THE SHIT.

42:46.190 --> 42:47.851
I BELIEVE
IT WAS ARTHUR.

42:49.200 --> 42:50.258
ARTHUR ?

42:50.360 --> 42:54.262
GEORGE, ARTHUR QUIT TODAY
AFTER I CONFRONTED HIM.

42:54.370 --> 42:57.032
AND, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW
THAT ARTHUR AND I ONCE HAD...

42:57.140 --> 42:58.391
SOMETHING.

42:58.500 --> 43:00.559
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

43:02.140 --> 43:02.902
NO NEED.

43:03.010 --> 43:05.604
IT'S NONE OF
MY BUSINESS.

43:05.710 --> 43:08.645
BUT HE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
SOMEONE YOU'D BE ATTRACTED TO.

43:08.750 --> 43:10.775
WELL, IT WASN'T...

43:10.880 --> 43:12.984
IT WASN'T
A RELATIONSHIP.

43:13.090 --> 43:16.150
BUT WE DID CARE DEEPLY
FOR ONE ANOTHER,

43:16.260 --> 43:19.320
WE UNDERSTOOD ONE ANOTHER,
WE HAD SIMILAR INTERESTS.

43:19.430 --> 43:20.488
SIMILAR INTERESTS ?

43:20.590 --> 43:22.694
LIKE SEX ?

43:22.800 --> 43:24.722
NO, NO, IT WASN'T
LIKE THAT.

43:24.830 --> 43:27.219
WE HAD OUR
OWN LANGUAGE.

43:28.170 --> 43:29.592
WE NUZZLED.

43:29.700 --> 43:31.634
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

43:31.740 --> 43:34.061
THE WAY
HORSES NUZZLE.

43:34.170 --> 43:36.400
LIKE A HEAD... RUBBING.

43:36.510 --> 43:37.977
A HEAD BUTTING.

43:40.110 --> 43:41.668
YOU BUTTED HEADS ?

43:41.780 --> 43:43.748
OH, YOU MAKE IT
SOUND SO SORDID !

43:43.850 --> 43:46.842
LOOK, WE DID THIS...

43:48.520 --> 43:50.317
( laughing )

43:50.420 --> 43:52.354
STOP IT,
IT WAS QUITE LOVELY.

43:52.460 --> 43:54.928
IT WASN'T FUNNY.

43:57.560 --> 43:59.391
YES, MAYBE
WE WERE A LITTLE CRAZY.

43:59.500 --> 44:03.994
IT'S CALLED
A FOLIE A DEUX.

44:04.100 --> 44:08.469
TWO PEOPLE CONFUSING
A MOMENTARY INSANITY FOR LOVE.

44:08.570 --> 44:10.879
IS THAT WHAT
IT'S CALLED ?

44:10.980 --> 44:12.049
MMM-HMM.

44:12.150 --> 44:14.175
( laughing )

44:28.730 --> 44:30.288
( sighing )

44:43.010 --> 44:44.136
OH--

44:44.240 --> 44:47.869
OH, I'M SORRY, JADEN AND I
HAVE TO GO MEET SOME PEOPLE

44:47.980 --> 44:49.743
AT THE GROVE
IN A FEW MINUTES.

44:49.850 --> 44:51.374
NO, IT'S FINE,
I JUST THOUGHT--

44:51.480 --> 44:53.243
HEY...

44:53.350 --> 44:54.749
DID YOU GET
MY BED ALL WET ?

44:54.860 --> 44:56.589
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE COMING BACK.

44:56.690 --> 44:58.510
I WISH.

44:58.620 --> 45:01.327
WELL, IF YOU WANT, MAYA AND I
COULD STAY HERE WITH THE NANNY.

45:01.430 --> 45:02.749
I COULD POP
IN A MOVIE FOR HER

45:02.860 --> 45:04.122
AND WE COULD BE WAITING
WHEN YOU GET BACK.

45:04.230 --> 45:07.461
( laughing )

45:07.570 --> 45:09.561
YOU'RE FUNNY.

45:09.670 --> 45:15.028
GOD, THESE SHEETS
FEEL SO GOOD.

45:17.280 --> 45:18.679
I'VE NEVER FELT
ANYTHING LIKE THEM.

45:18.780 --> 45:20.145
WHERE ARE
THEY FROM ?

45:22.780 --> 45:24.179
UM...

45:25.420 --> 45:27.342
I NEED YOU
TO LEAVE.

45:33.230 --> 45:34.720
RIGHT.

45:41.770 --> 45:44.091
SO IT'S THAT EASY ?

45:44.200 --> 45:45.428
WHAT IS ?

45:45.540 --> 45:48.100
I MEAN, HOW ARE PEOPLE
SUPPOSED TO DO THIS, EXACTLY ?

45:50.480 --> 45:52.778
SO NOW WHAT, I'M SUPPOSED
TO JUST AVOID THAT PARTICULAR

45:52.880 --> 45:54.370
MOMMY AND ME CLASS ?

45:54.480 --> 45:55.777
OR WHAT, YOU'RE JUST
GONNA SEND YOUR NANNY

45:55.880 --> 45:57.211
SO YOU CAN AVOID
LOOKING AT ME ?

45:57.320 --> 45:58.218
AND SEEING ME ?

45:58.320 --> 45:59.787
AND SEEING WHAT
I THOUGHT I SAW IN YOU ?

46:00.890 --> 46:02.983
AND SO I JUST
CEASE TO EXIST.

46:05.490 --> 46:06.957
AND SO DO YOU.

46:10.130 --> 46:11.859
NATE ?

46:11.970 --> 46:13.767
ARE YOU OKAY ?

46:14.970 --> 46:17.131
I'M SORRY, I DON'T
KNOW WHY I'M DOING THIS.

46:19.070 --> 46:22.039
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE,
WE'LL GO.

46:25.780 --> 46:27.998
OKAY, I'LL WAIT
FOR YOU DOWNSTAIRS.

46:36.190 --> 46:37.509
( sighing )

46:43.900 --> 46:45.959
OH GOD.

47:13.590 --> 47:15.251
YOU GOT IN TROUBLE ?

47:15.360 --> 47:17.794
WHAT, DID YOU ASK FOR HER
AUTOGRAPH OR SOMETHING ?

47:17.900 --> 47:19.219
OR LOOK HER
IN THE EYE ?

47:19.330 --> 47:20.627
NO, WORSE.

47:20.730 --> 47:22.869
I PEED IN HER JOHN.

47:22.970 --> 47:25.109
WHAT, YOU MEAN LIKE
ON THE TOILET SEAT ?

47:25.210 --> 47:26.507
NO.

47:26.610 --> 47:27.907
I LII-TED
THE TOILET SEAT.

47:28.010 --> 47:29.705
I JUST USED
THE SAME TOILET
SHE DID.

47:29.810 --> 47:31.778
WHICH APPARENTLY
IS A MAJOR FAUX PAS.

47:31.880 --> 47:35.270
WELL, IF IT HELPS,
MY DAY SUCKED, TOO.

47:35.380 --> 47:36.608
ARTHUR QUIT.

47:36.720 --> 47:38.369
YEAH, I'M IN HELL

47:38.480 --> 47:41.586
AND I'LL PROBABLY NEVER BE HOME
IN TIME FOR DINNER AGAIN.

47:41.690 --> 47:44.454
SO WHERE'S YOUR
OTHER BROTHER ?

47:44.560 --> 47:48.121
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, YOU'RE
IN LOVE WITH MY BROTHER NOW ?

47:48.230 --> 47:50.790
I JUST ASKED
WHERE HE WAS.

47:50.900 --> 47:53.789
GOD, IF NO ONE
BUYS THIS STUFF

47:53.900 --> 47:56.095
I AM NOT DRAGGING IT
BACK UPSTAIRS.

47:56.200 --> 47:58.930
I'M JUST NOT
FEELING THIS

47:59.040 --> 48:01.099
LIKE HIPPY DIPPY PAISLEY CRAP
ANYMORE, YOU KNOW ?

48:01.210 --> 48:05.078
IT'S LIKE, SUDDENLY
I JUST FEEL MODERN AND SIMPLE

48:05.180 --> 48:08.172
AND I JUST WANT LIKE
WHITE PLASTIC FURNITURE.

48:12.750 --> 48:14.889
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST TRASH
ALL THE SHIT YOU DON'T WANT ?

48:14.990 --> 48:15.957
OR TAKE IT
TO THE THRII-T STORE.

48:16.060 --> 48:18.654
YEAH, OR BURN IT.

48:18.760 --> 48:19.829
( laughing )

48:19.930 --> 48:22.490
YEAH.

48:24.760 --> 48:26.421
YEAH.

48:27.030 --> 48:28.463
HEY, MOM !

48:28.570 --> 48:30.993
HEY, MOM, WHY DON'T WE JUST
BURN WHAT'S LEI-T OVER ?

48:31.100 --> 48:34.558
WE CAN'T, SOME OF
THIS STUFF IS VALUABLE.

48:34.670 --> 48:36.206
SURE YOU WANNA
SAVE THIS ?

48:37.080 --> 48:39.605
THAT WAS
ARTHUR'S POUCH.

48:39.710 --> 48:41.371
A COUPLE
PENNIES IN IT.

48:43.920 --> 48:45.148
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT,
CLAIRE.

48:45.250 --> 48:47.309
LET'S BURN IT,
LET'S BURN IT ALL.

48:51.420 --> 48:53.388
I MISSED YOU.

48:53.490 --> 48:55.321
YOU WERE SO FAR AWAY.

48:55.430 --> 48:58.228
ALL THE WAY ACROSS
THE COURTYARD.

49:01.200 --> 49:03.065
IT WAS NICE KNOWING
WHERE YOU WERE

49:03.170 --> 49:04.933
EVEN WHEN
WE WEREN'T TALKING.

49:05.040 --> 49:07.133
WERE WE NOT TALKING ?

49:08.810 --> 49:10.698
NOT OFFICIALLY,
I GUESS.

49:15.320 --> 49:17.777
SO THIS QUESTION
OF NORMAL SEX.

49:17.880 --> 49:19.245
I KNOW,
IT IS SO SILLY.

49:19.350 --> 49:22.114
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I SAID IT.

49:22.220 --> 49:23.585
I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT I MEANT.

49:23.690 --> 49:27.820
I THINK I JUST WANTED SO MUCH
TO DO IT RIGHT THIS TIME,

49:27.930 --> 49:29.192
AND I THOUGHT--

49:29.300 --> 49:31.154
FUNNY, 'CAUSE THE MORE
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT,

49:31.260 --> 49:33.865
THE MORE NORMAL SEX JUST
KINDA SEEMED LIKE...

49:33.970 --> 49:37.394
YOU KNOW, BAD SEX.

49:37.500 --> 49:40.003
I KNOW.

49:42.310 --> 49:46.098
I THINK IDEALLY SEX
FOR ME SHOULD BE THIS...

49:46.210 --> 49:48.371
REVEALING, OF MYSELF...

49:49.850 --> 49:52.011
OURSELVES, MAYBE.

49:56.090 --> 49:58.388
I THINK THAT COULD
BE A LOVING THING, TOO.

50:00.530 --> 50:01.349
RIGHT ?

50:01.460 --> 50:02.996
MMM.

50:04.860 --> 50:10.696
DON'T TAKE BRENDA APART AND JUST
SORT OF HAND ME THE GOOD STUFF.

50:13.070 --> 50:16.176
I WANT ALL THE STUFF,
EVEN THE BAD STUFF.

50:18.740 --> 50:21.402
( laughing )

50:22.950 --> 50:24.770
OH...

50:27.390 --> 50:29.585
MMM...

50:38.560 --> 50:39.492
SO...

50:40.870 --> 50:42.838
WHAT WAS IT...

50:42.940 --> 50:45.158
THAT YOU WANTED TO SAY ?

50:48.610 --> 50:50.430
WELL...

50:53.550 --> 50:55.472
REMEMBER WHEN I SAID
I COULD WAIT ON YOU
