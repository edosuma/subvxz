God, the Clam sucks
on Saturday mornings.

00:40.282 --> 00:42.699
It's all just weird
foreign sports fans,

00:42.710 --> 00:45.494
like those Pakistani
cricket hooligans.

00:45.570 --> 00:47.204
If you are not rooting
for Lahore,

00:47.214 --> 00:49.206
please you may leave,
I can tell you!

00:49.216 --> 00:50.883
Lahore cricketers are the best,

00:50.959 --> 00:54.002
and the others are<i> not</i> the best,
dear friends.

00:54.079 --> 00:57.964
I'm for Karachi, but I don't
got a death wish about it.

00:58.041 --> 00:59.725
Guys, what's wrong with us?

00:59.802 --> 01:02.052
It's Saturday morning,
and we're drinking in a bar.

01:02.063 --> 01:04.805
We should be drinking at
the Goodwill donation dumpster.

01:04.881 --> 01:07.733
-Why come?
-'Cause right now's
when all the yard sales end.

01:07.810 --> 01:10.185
We can get first pick
of the abandoned leftovers.

01:10.262 --> 01:11.728
That's a stupid idea.
There's not gonna

01:11.739 --> 01:13.855
be anything good
in that dumpster.

01:13.932 --> 01:16.817
PETER: What if I told you
everything I'm wearing right now

01:16.893 --> 01:18.077
I found in that dumpster?

01:18.153 --> 01:21.238
Is that a bachelorette sash?

01:21.248 --> 01:25.167
Scott said I could do hand stuff
this weekend, but that's it.

01:28.780 --> 01:30.205
I told you this is stupid.

01:30.282 --> 01:31.748
There's nothing good in here.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.333
Hey, look--
a pair of working legs.

01:33.410 --> 01:34.876
Dibs on these.

01:34.953 --> 01:36.878
Wha...? Aw, come on, Quagmire!

01:36.955 --> 01:38.505
Joe, I said dibs.

01:38.582 --> 01:41.091
No, no, you're right.
You said dibs.

01:41.102 --> 01:43.769
Whoa. Check it out.
A Sorry! board game.

01:43.846 --> 01:45.104
Let me see it.

01:45.180 --> 01:46.721
(soft rattling)

01:46.798 --> 01:49.182
-Three pieces missing.
-How'd you do that?

01:49.259 --> 01:52.361
I can shake anything and
figure out what all's in there.

01:54.806 --> 01:57.440
You got 11 periods left.

01:57.451 --> 02:00.110
Cool. VHS of<i> Eraserhead.</i>

02:00.121 --> 02:03.071
This'll be good for when
I never want to sleep again.

02:03.148 --> 02:05.949
Holy crap.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.209
Wha-What? What is it?

02:10.155 --> 02:11.621
A Magic 8 Ball!

02:11.632 --> 02:13.582
This thing can tell the future.

02:13.658 --> 02:15.792
No, it can't, Peter.
It's just a stupid toy.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.252
I don't know. Let's test it.

02:17.329 --> 02:20.472
Will there be snow
this Christmas?

02:20.549 --> 02:23.425
(gasps)
Oh, my God, the ball is right.

02:23.460 --> 02:24.759
I<i> should</i> ask again later.

02:24.836 --> 02:26.311
How did it know that?

02:26.388 --> 02:28.388
Guys, from now on,
I am living my life

02:28.465 --> 02:30.432
according to the Magic 8 Ball.

02:30.508 --> 02:32.317
It will lead me
like the shorebird

02:32.394 --> 02:34.778
that led the first Pilgrims
to Boston.

02:35.914 --> 02:38.440
Ahoy!
Are you looking to build a city

02:38.516 --> 02:41.443
where sports fans
can be notoriously racist?

02:41.519 --> 02:43.871
Yeah, and can we also ruin
"Sweet Caroline"

02:43.906 --> 02:46.114
-for everyone else?
-Absolutely.

02:46.191 --> 02:49.492
Can our airport security people
be responsible for 9/11?

02:49.503 --> 02:53.172
And can our own 9/11 be, like,
one one-thousandth as bad,

02:53.248 --> 02:55.340
but we'll still make
a fricking movie about it?

02:55.417 --> 02:57.125
I think I know just the place.

02:57.202 --> 02:59.836
Okay, I don't know
if this is gonna be a problem,

02:59.847 --> 03:01.796
but we forgot
to bring the letter "R."

03:01.873 --> 03:03.348
No problem at all.

03:03.425 --> 03:05.851
Right this way,
large-faced whites!

03:05.928 --> 03:07.844
ALL (chanting):
Let's go, Red Sox!

03:07.855 --> 03:09.354
(rhythmic clapping)

03:09.431 --> 03:11.815
Let's go, Red Sox!

03:16.772 --> 03:18.197
What is that?

03:18.273 --> 03:19.689
It's my Magic 8 Ball.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.200
This is the first black ball

03:21.276 --> 03:23.652
that Kim Kardashian
hasn't played with.

03:23.728 --> 03:26.371
Why is it filled with the blue
liquid from tampon commercials?

03:26.448 --> 03:28.198
That's a very gross question,
Meg.

03:28.209 --> 03:29.917
You may take your breakfast
in the attic.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.871
That question aside, I'm having
a blast with my new 8 Ball.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.164
It knows everything. Watch.

03:36.241 --> 03:38.124
Magic 8 Ball,

03:38.201 --> 03:41.220
will my middle-of-the-highway
puppet show be a success?

03:42.723 --> 03:44.598
Well, I'll show this thing.

03:47.469 --> 03:48.551
(truck horn blaring)

03:48.562 --> 03:49.895
-(tires screeching)
-(thud)

03:52.399 --> 03:54.057
How'd it go, Dad?

03:54.068 --> 03:56.017
I don't know, Sparky.
What did you think?

03:56.094 --> 03:59.020
The performance was
a little flat.

03:59.097 --> 04:01.698
(instrumental
<i> Family Guy</i> theme plays)

04:13.996 --> 04:16.204
Magic 8 Ball.

04:16.281 --> 04:18.164
Magic 8 Ball, I'm bored.

04:18.241 --> 04:20.217
Should I sniff
my coworker's hair?

04:23.413 --> 04:24.754
He told me to do it!

04:24.765 --> 04:27.007
Mr. Griffin,
if a Magic 8 Ball asked you

04:27.083 --> 04:29.175
to jump off a building,
would you do that, too?

04:29.252 --> 04:30.677
Did it?

04:30.754 --> 04:33.179
No, I'm just using that
as an example of...

04:33.256 --> 04:35.107
I listened to the toy!

04:38.928 --> 04:42.114
Magic 8 Ball,
what's the best e-mail provider?

04:43.525 --> 04:45.859
"Outlook good."
Interesting.

04:45.935 --> 04:48.194
He's not raving about it,
but it's a solid choice.

04:48.271 --> 04:50.363
Let's go, Peter.
Time for church.

04:50.440 --> 04:53.625
Mom said they're gonna serve
Chewy Chips Ahoy at coffee hour.

04:53.702 --> 04:55.243
Lois... church?

04:55.320 --> 04:57.245
Who am I supposed to worship--
Jesus?

04:57.322 --> 04:59.080
<i> This</i> is my god now.

04:59.157 --> 05:00.465
Watch your mouth, Peter.

05:00.542 --> 05:03.376
Sorry, Lois, but my religion
is now the 8 Ball.

05:03.453 --> 05:06.638
Magic 8 Ball,
is the Fox network sustainable

05:06.715 --> 05:08.640
in this new streaming world?

05:09.643 --> 05:12.594
No. No!

05:12.670 --> 05:14.054
(gasps)

05:14.130 --> 05:15.805
Kim, what's wrong?

05:15.816 --> 05:19.151
A black ball went to waste.

05:26.643 --> 05:28.985
Are you streaming<i> Mindhunter</i>
in church?

05:28.996 --> 05:31.830
I'm<i> trying</i> to stream
<i> Mindhunter</i> in church.

05:35.911 --> 05:37.336
Freaking guest Wi-Fi.

05:37.412 --> 05:40.038
You know
the priest gets the good Wi-Fi.

05:40.115 --> 05:41.673
And yea, the Lord said...

05:41.750 --> 05:43.625
Whoa, whoa.
<i> Mindhunter's</i> going in.

05:43.701 --> 05:45.251
I mean... (clears throat)

05:45.328 --> 05:47.962
Thou art the children
of Abraham, and thou shalt...

05:48.039 --> 05:49.348
He's playing you!

05:49.424 --> 05:51.591
You think you're playing him?
He's playing you.

05:51.668 --> 05:53.593
I hate this.
When do I get my cookie?

05:53.670 --> 05:55.929
I just want my cookie
so I can go home.

05:56.005 --> 05:57.972
Now please join me
in silent prayer.

05:58.049 --> 05:59.974
And as we settle
into the silence,

06:00.051 --> 06:02.352
I remind you that--
in honor of Lent--

06:02.363 --> 06:06.823
today's coffee service will not
include Chewy Chips Ahoy.

06:11.020 --> 06:13.822
-(bleep)
-(all gasping)

06:13.898 --> 06:15.665
-(Lois gasps)
-(congregation murmurs)

06:17.711 --> 06:20.212
Hey, Stewie said his first word.

06:20.288 --> 06:22.214
And it was a swear.

06:22.290 --> 06:24.549
Well, this is unacceptable.

06:24.626 --> 06:27.377
We have to leave right now
and go straight to breakfast.

06:27.388 --> 06:29.262
Unbelievable.

06:30.707 --> 06:32.048
(car door opens, closes)

06:32.059 --> 06:34.217
(engine starts)

06:34.228 --> 06:36.228
Let's go!

06:42.260 --> 06:45.228
I can't believe Stewie
finally said his first word

06:45.239 --> 06:47.313
and it ends up being... that.

06:47.390 --> 06:50.400
Right now, every woman in my
mommy wine group is judging me.

06:50.411 --> 06:53.445
I may have to start
drinking wine at home alone.

06:53.521 --> 06:56.489
-Start?
-Not the day for it, Chris!
Not the day!

06:56.566 --> 06:58.825
I don't get it, Stewie.
You've been talking forever.

06:58.902 --> 07:00.252
Why did everyone suddenly
understand you now?

07:00.328 --> 07:01.995
I don't know.

07:02.071 --> 07:04.330
I was feeling so much
intense emotion in the moment,

07:04.407 --> 07:06.749
and that one word somehow
just burst through.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.927
Yeah, but now what?
Everyone can understand you?

07:09.004 --> 07:10.670
I don't think so.

07:10.747 --> 07:13.423
Not unless I'm yelling something
I feel strongly about.

07:13.434 --> 07:16.268
Greta Gerwig
is a national treasure!

07:16.344 --> 07:18.011
See? Nothing.

07:18.087 --> 07:19.846
I guess I'm not feeling it.
I don't know.

07:19.923 --> 07:22.891
What if that's the only thing
I'll ever be able to express?

07:22.967 --> 07:25.685
Anger. What kind
of a person would I be then?

07:25.762 --> 07:27.270
Larry David, Lewis Black,

07:27.281 --> 07:29.606
a Trump voter,
everyone on Twitter.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.691
But I don't want
to be any of those things.

07:31.768 --> 07:33.067
They've got to hear me.

07:33.144 --> 07:34.861
Ice cream! Lollipop!

07:34.938 --> 07:36.362
Bubbles! Kitty cat!

07:36.439 --> 07:37.739
<i> (Curb Your Enthusiasm</i> theme
plays)

07:37.815 --> 07:39.908
Doggy! Raincoat! Preschool!

07:39.984 --> 07:43.912
Fire truck! Goldfish!
Finger paint!

07:43.988 --> 07:47.048
(soft chatter, laughter)

07:48.117 --> 07:49.626
Lois, what are you doing here?

07:49.636 --> 07:51.803
What do you mean?
You invited us.

07:51.880 --> 07:54.797
Sorry, but we can't
have Stewie here.

07:54.850 --> 07:56.141
I brought my own veggie burgers,

07:56.218 --> 07:57.800
but I'm not gonna make
a big deal about it.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.136
What with his profanity and all,
I don't think

08:00.147 --> 08:02.764
Stewie would be a good influence
on the other children.

08:02.840 --> 08:04.483
Is there a designated spot
on the grill

08:04.559 --> 08:05.808
for the veggie burgers?

08:05.819 --> 08:07.310
And again, not a big deal.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.437
You're saying
that because of a swear word,

08:09.514 --> 08:12.148
my son isn't good enough
for your pool party?

08:12.159 --> 08:14.159
It's a little bit
about him swearing,

08:14.236 --> 08:16.286
but mostly
about<i> you</i> as a parent.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.739
Kevin, I said, no arrows!

08:19.816 --> 08:21.500
KEVIN:
Crossbows don't shoot arrows.

08:21.576 --> 08:23.451
They shoot bolts, dumbass!

08:23.504 --> 08:25.411
(chuckles)
Okay, sweetie.

08:25.488 --> 08:28.915
KEVIN:
Hey, Dad, did you hear
what Einstein called bolts?

08:28.992 --> 08:30.342
JOE:
I heard it.

08:33.830 --> 08:35.588
Brian, shut off the television.

08:35.665 --> 08:37.006
It's ruined my baby!

08:37.017 --> 08:38.424
What are you talking about?

08:38.501 --> 08:41.094
Stewie obviously learned
to swear from some TV show.

08:41.170 --> 08:44.013
No, he didn't. The only show
he watches is<i> Caillou.</i>

08:44.048 --> 08:45.848
Well, then that little
French-Canadian weirdo

08:45.859 --> 08:48.142
is the potty mouth,
I'm sure of it.

08:48.219 --> 08:50.770
And I'm willing to watch every
single episode just to prove it.

08:50.847 --> 08:52.697
<i> NARRATOR:</i>
<i> Caillou was upset.</i>

08:52.774 --> 08:56.317
<i> Why am I bald?</i>
<i> I'm not a baby. I'm four.</i>

08:56.394 --> 08:58.778
<i> Are kids just bald in Canada?</i>

08:58.855 --> 09:00.405
<i> NARRATOR: So Caillou decided</i>

09:00.481 --> 09:01.781
<i> to look himself up</i>
<i> on Wikipedia.</i>

09:01.858 --> 09:03.950
God, this is dull.

09:04.027 --> 09:06.044
<i> CAILLOU: Maybe I'm supposed</i>
<i> to be a cancer survivor,</i>

09:06.121 --> 09:08.621
<i> and this show</i>
<i> is very inspiring.</i>

09:08.698 --> 09:11.165
<i> NARRATOR: But Caillou</i>
<i> wasn't a cancer survivor.</i>

09:11.242 --> 09:14.627
<i> The show's creators</i>
<i> just made a weird choice.</i>

09:14.704 --> 09:17.130
<i> Caillou's</i>
<i> low-testosterone father</i>

09:17.206 --> 09:19.632
<i> again indulged</i>
<i> Caillou's tantrum,</i>

09:19.709 --> 09:22.051
<i> clearly trying</i>
<i> to raise a sociopath.</i>

09:22.062 --> 09:23.386
<i> CAILLOU'S FATHER:</i>
<i> It's okay, Caillou.</i>

09:23.397 --> 09:25.638
<i> I'll bake you a pie.</i>

09:25.715 --> 09:28.224
<i> NARRATOR:</i>
<i> He said, his body flooding</i>
<i> with estrogen.</i>

09:28.235 --> 09:29.642
Lois?

09:29.719 --> 09:31.069
Are you dead?

09:31.146 --> 09:32.404
(sniffing)

09:32.480 --> 09:33.896
Can I eat you?

09:33.907 --> 09:36.241
-Huh? What?
-Ah, another time.

09:36.318 --> 09:40.320
Oh. I-I, um... I watched
that<i> Caillou,</i> and you're right.

09:40.396 --> 09:42.697
Stewie didn't learn that word
from<i> Caillou.</i>

09:42.774 --> 09:44.824
That means he learned it
from someone in this house.

09:44.901 --> 09:47.085
-Okay.
-And I will find out who.

09:47.162 --> 09:48.870
I'm gonna set a trap

09:48.946 --> 09:51.331
and lure the swearer
into revealing himself.

18:43.772 --> 18:45.957
I'm sorry
I left you guys on your own.

18:46.033 --> 18:47.783
This is where I want to be.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.460
Is that okay with you guys?

18:49.537 --> 18:50.536
Of course, Lois.

18:50.613 --> 18:52.037
Everyone's glad you're home,

18:52.114 --> 18:54.248
except for
mean older brother Buzz,

18:54.325 --> 18:55.916
who never says anything nice.

18:55.993 --> 18:57.585
Uh-oh. Here he is now.

18:57.661 --> 18:58.878
Hey, Lois.

18:58.954 --> 19:00.972
Pretty cool you're back.

19:01.048 --> 19:03.674
Aw, I guess he's not such
a bad guy after all.

19:03.751 --> 19:05.977
Also, America should only accept
white immigrants.

19:06.053 --> 19:08.137
Uhp, nope,
he's still a bad guy.

19:08.148 --> 19:10.389
Well, I am so happy to be home.

19:10.466 --> 19:13.934
But there's one little guy
I missed most of all.

19:14.011 --> 19:16.896

I'll tell you what's happening,
Brian.

The whole family's becoming Jack
Kerouac's insufferable friends.

No one wants us at
their apartment party, ya dig?
