WEBVTT

00:01.484 --> 00:04.280
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.418 --> 00:07.283
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.421 --> 00:11.804
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.942 --> 00:14.738
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.876 --> 00:17.672
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.810 --> 00:21.987
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.471 --> 00:25.887
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.026 --> 00:28.580
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.718 --> 00:31.238
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.376 --> 00:33.895
Just to get up that hill

00:34.034 --> 00:36.484
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.622 --> 00:39.108
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.246 --> 00:41.593
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.731 --> 00:43.319
Ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.457 --> 00:46.149
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.287 --> 00:49.221
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.359 --> 00:53.743
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.881 --> 00:56.608
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.746 --> 00:59.749
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.887 --> 01:05.789
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:09.690 --> 01:11.450
On the ninth day
of Christmas

01:11.588 --> 01:13.418
My true love gave to me

01:13.556 --> 01:14.695
Nine ladies dancing,

01:14.833 --> 01:15.903
Eight maids a-milking,

01:16.041 --> 01:17.491
Seven swans a-swimming,

01:17.629 --> 01:18.802
Six geese a-laying,

01:18.940 --> 01:21.840
Five golden rings

01:21.978 --> 01:23.290
Four calling birds

01:23.428 --> 01:24.981
Three french hens

01:25.119 --> 01:27.811
Two turtle doves

01:27.949 --> 01:31.746
And a partridge in a
pear tree

01:31.884 --> 01:33.714
I just love Christmas carols.

01:33.852 --> 01:35.785
Y'all shoulda heard me singing
in the shower this morning.

01:35.923 --> 01:39.444
Oh was that you singing?
I thought somebody was
drowning a cat.

01:41.273 --> 01:43.448
Oh Florence, you
forgot to bring out the
forks for the cake.

01:43.586 --> 01:44.897
Oh! What's the matter with me?

01:45.035 --> 01:46.036
I'll tell you what's
the matter with you,

01:46.175 --> 01:48.591
you been guzzling
down the eggnog again.

01:48.729 --> 01:50.489
No, I ain't. I just
had one little glass.

01:50.627 --> 01:52.353
Yeah, but you had
it eight times!

01:54.321 --> 01:57.151
Oh, let her have
her fun, George.
It's a holiday.

01:57.289 --> 01:58.946
It's okay with me Weezy,
but look,

01:59.084 --> 02:02.260
next year, let's just skip
the tree and put all our
presents under Florence.

02:02.398 --> 02:03.813
She's always lit
for Christmas.

02:05.746 --> 02:07.886
Oh this is so
exciting, George!

02:08.024 --> 02:10.475
Just think, we get to
celebrate Christmas

02:10.613 --> 02:13.443
and Lionel and Jenny's
anniversary
on the same night.

02:13.581 --> 02:15.583
Whoopee!

02:15.721 --> 02:18.448
Oh, c'mon, don't you see
how fortunate we are?

02:18.586 --> 02:21.658
Last Christmas, Santa Claus
brought us a daughter-in-law.

02:21.796 --> 02:25.628
Ooh, maybe if we stuff
her in a stocking, this
year he'll take her back.

02:27.250 --> 02:29.079
George, you don't
mean that.
Aw yeah?

02:30.805 --> 02:33.256
Hey, Miss Jefferson,
I think I better make
another batch of eggnog.

02:33.394 --> 02:35.672
Already? Ain't nobody
even been here yet.

02:35.810 --> 02:37.053
What happened to
the first batch?

02:37.191 --> 02:39.159
This stuff evaporates
like crazy!

02:42.507 --> 02:43.991
Hey Merry Christmas,
everybody.

02:44.129 --> 02:45.303
Merry Christmas.

02:45.441 --> 02:47.063
Merry Christmas, Leroy.

02:47.201 --> 02:49.030
Uh Mrs. Jefferson,
I just closed the shop,

02:49.169 --> 02:52.172
so I brought up the star
you wanted for your
Christmas tree.

02:52.310 --> 02:54.760
Oh great, Leroy.
Where is it?

02:54.898 --> 02:57.384
Isn't that the tree
right over there?

02:57.832 --> 02:59.386
I meant the star.

02:59.903 --> 03:01.526
Oh, yeah.

03:01.664 --> 03:05.771
It's in my shopping bag.
Oh, here it is.

03:05.909 --> 03:08.360
Oh, you dropped something.

03:08.498 --> 03:10.190
Well, I don't wanna
forget that.

03:10.328 --> 03:13.641
You know, that's my errand
for Mr. Jefferson.

03:13.779 --> 03:17.507
"984 West 124th Street,
Apartment 5C."

03:17.645 --> 03:19.613
Oh that's just business,
Weezy. It don't concern you.

03:19.751 --> 03:21.477
Bye, Leroy.

03:21.615 --> 03:26.309
Uh but, George, it's
just an address. There's
no stamp or name on it.

03:26.447 --> 03:28.277
Now how's the Post Office
gonna deliver this?

03:28.415 --> 03:31.659
Oh, this ain't going to the
Post Office, Mrs. Jefferson.

03:31.797 --> 03:36.146
I been taking an
envelope to this address
every month for years,

03:36.285 --> 03:42.532
'cause Mr. Jefferson said
he don't trust sending
cash in the mail.

03:42.670 --> 03:44.016
Cash?

03:44.154 --> 03:46.916
Uh well, it's always
good to see you for
the holidays, Leroy!

03:47.054 --> 03:49.712
Merry Christmas,
Happy New Year, and
get the hell outta here.

03:49.850 --> 03:53.302
Merry Christmas.

03:53.440 --> 03:56.857
George, why are you sending
cash to that address
in Harlem every month?

03:56.995 --> 03:58.548
I told you, it's
business Weezy.

03:58.686 --> 04:00.481
What kind of business?

04:03.760 --> 04:05.279
I took out this loan
a little while ago.

04:05.417 --> 04:07.316
And my accountant says I
got to pay it back in cash

04:07.454 --> 04:09.904
or my assets and
liabilities will be more
than my working capital.

04:10.042 --> 04:11.216
Don't you understand that?

04:11.354 --> 04:12.459
No.

04:12.597 --> 04:13.839
Neither do I, but that's
what the man said.

04:15.151 --> 04:17.049
Now, listen!
I'll get it!

04:20.605 --> 04:22.469
Bentley! What are
you doing?

04:22.607 --> 04:25.265
Oh! Mr. J! I was expecting
Mrs. J. to answer.

04:25.403 --> 04:26.990
What were you gonna do?
Scare her to death?

04:28.233 --> 04:31.167
No, I was going to kiss her.
You were gonna what?

04:31.305 --> 04:33.721
Mistletoe, Mr. J.,
mistletoe.

04:33.859 --> 04:35.999
Merry Christmas, Mrs. J.

04:36.137 --> 04:37.794
Merry Christmas, Mr. Bentley.

04:37.932 --> 04:39.071
Mr. J.?

04:39.209 --> 04:40.763
I don't care if that
is mistletoe, Bentley,

04:40.901 --> 04:42.489
all you're getting from
me is a handshake!

04:42.627 --> 04:44.318
Merry Christmas.

04:44.456 --> 04:46.493
Merry Christmas,
Bentley. You know,

04:46.631 --> 04:49.185
you might be from England
and crazy and all that,

04:49.323 --> 04:51.187
but you're still
good people.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.396
Thank you.

04:53.534 --> 04:56.882
Well, Mr. Bentley,
you certainly have the
Christmas spirit this year.

04:57.020 --> 04:58.608
Oh, everybody has!

04:58.746 --> 05:01.853
You should've seen the
wild Christmas party
we had at the UN today.

05:01.991 --> 05:03.544
At one point an
American interpreter

05:03.682 --> 05:06.271
tried to put a pair
of silk stockings on
a Russian secretary.

05:06.409 --> 05:08.515
Oh the Russian secretary
didn't like that, huh?

05:08.653 --> 05:11.000
Oh goodness, no! He hadn't
even shaved his legs!

05:13.278 --> 05:16.039
Would you like to stay
for dinner, Mr. Bentley?
We have plenty.

05:16.177 --> 05:19.491
Oh, no thank you.
I'm cooking dinner for
Charlotte this evening.

05:19.629 --> 05:22.356
Charlotte?
Another new girl?

05:22.494 --> 05:25.152
Yes, and I'm making her
a little three pound roast,

05:25.290 --> 05:28.293
but I'm missing one
ingredient and I thought
you might have it.

05:28.431 --> 05:29.363
What is it?

05:29.501 --> 05:31.158
A little three pound roast.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.749
I forgot to defrost mine.

05:35.887 --> 05:38.096
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

05:38.234 --> 05:40.340
Oh well, perhaps I'll just
lay out some cold cuts.

05:40.478 --> 05:44.240
After all, I'd rather have a
cold dinner and a warm girl
than the other way around.

05:44.378 --> 05:45.345
Ta-ta!

05:45.483 --> 05:47.519
Oh, Mrs. Willis.
Merry Christmas.

05:47.657 --> 05:48.934
Same to you, Mr. Bentley.

05:49.072 --> 05:50.177
Mr. Willis...

05:50.315 --> 05:51.903
Ah, watch out for my leg!

05:52.041 --> 05:55.044
Joy to the world,
The Lord is...

05:55.182 --> 05:57.080
Come on, Helen,
I've got to sit down.

05:57.218 --> 05:58.461
Oh, my leg...

05:58.599 --> 06:00.049
Tom, what's the
matter with you?

06:00.187 --> 06:04.087
Oh, I was Santa Claus
at the Children's Hospital
again this year.

06:04.225 --> 06:06.193
What happened? Did
a reindeer bite you?

06:08.402 --> 06:12.786
I asked this little kid
to tell Santa what he
wanted for Christmas.

06:12.924 --> 06:16.065
He said a sled.
So I told him he'd get one.

06:16.203 --> 06:18.895
Then the kid yelled,
"That's what you said
last year, ya liar!"

06:19.033 --> 06:20.103
And he kicked me!

06:22.658 --> 06:26.213
Oh, but that's not all.
The next kid said
he wanted a bicycle.

06:26.351 --> 06:28.318
So this time I figured
I'd be smarter.

06:28.457 --> 06:31.667
I said, "Maybe you'll get it,
maybe you won't."

06:31.805 --> 06:34.980
And then the kid's mother
yelled, "Stop teasing him,
you big bully!"

06:35.118 --> 06:36.257
And she kicked me!

06:37.811 --> 06:39.882
It's so hard playing
Santa Claus.

06:40.020 --> 06:43.368
Even if you can do it
without wearing a pillow.

06:43.506 --> 06:45.059
Helen, please.

06:46.095 --> 06:48.546
Well you just sit
there and relax, Tom.

06:48.684 --> 06:51.790
Florence, would you bring some
eggnog to the Willises?

06:53.827 --> 06:56.795
I think it'll be easier to
bring the Willises to
the eggnog.

07:01.593 --> 07:03.630
Florence doesn't
look too good.

07:03.768 --> 07:05.148
She never looks good.

07:06.633 --> 07:08.531
I mean, I hope she's
watching the dinner.

07:08.669 --> 07:11.258
Oh, damn! Florence,
what about the turkey?

07:11.396 --> 07:13.294
Don't worry, turkey.
There's plenty left for you.

07:16.781 --> 07:19.991
I mean the turkey
we're having for dinner!

07:20.129 --> 07:22.234
Oh, you mean that little
brown dude in the oven?

07:22.959 --> 07:25.030
Yeah, how's it doing?

07:25.168 --> 07:28.758
Just a second,
I'll go ask him.

07:28.896 --> 07:32.797
Oh, Louise, I wrapped Jenny's
and Lionel's anniversary
present from the four of us.

07:32.935 --> 07:34.488
Good. I'll put it
over by the cake.

07:38.112 --> 07:39.459
Ah, watch out for my leg.

07:42.703 --> 07:45.499
Helen, it's a conspiracy.
They're all after my leg.

07:46.604 --> 07:48.433
Merry Christmas,
Mr. Jefferson, sir!

07:48.571 --> 07:49.952
Merry Christmas,
everybody.

07:50.090 --> 07:51.678
ALL: Merry Christmas, Ralph.

07:51.816 --> 07:53.749
What can I do for you, Ralph?

07:53.887 --> 07:58.581
Well, I haven't seen either
of you in a couple of days
so I started to get worried.

07:58.719 --> 08:00.065
Worried? About what?

08:00.203 --> 08:02.102
About you.

08:02.240 --> 08:05.139
After all the trouble you
must've gone through to get
me my Christmas present,

08:05.277 --> 08:08.453
I know how terrible you'll
feel if you didn't get a
chance to give it to me.

08:11.249 --> 08:13.493
That's very thoughtful
of you, Ralph.

08:13.631 --> 08:16.288
Yep, and you got nothin'
to worry about.
Really, sir?

08:16.426 --> 08:17.876
Yeah, 'cause we didn't
get you anything!

08:19.533 --> 08:21.466
No problem, sir,
there's still time.

08:21.604 --> 08:24.365
As a matter of fact,
I have a list of
things I would like.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.023
Oh, I was gonna
give you cash.

08:27.161 --> 08:30.648
Good guess, sir! On my
list that's number one,
two and three.

08:32.097 --> 08:34.962
Here you are, Ralph.
Yes sir. Thank you, sir.

08:35.100 --> 08:38.483
Oh, by the way. Those
two Christmas trees
you had me order?

08:38.621 --> 08:41.348
Were they delivered okay?
Uh yeah, fine, thank
you. Later, Ralph.

08:41.486 --> 08:43.937
Wait a minute. Two trees?

08:44.075 --> 08:47.181
Yes, ma'am. One for here,
and one to that address
in Harlem.

08:47.319 --> 08:49.149
What address in Harlem?

08:49.287 --> 08:50.460
It was 984...

08:53.015 --> 08:55.500
He don't remember.

08:55.638 --> 08:59.608
984, that's the same place
you've been sending cash to,
isn't it?

08:59.746 --> 09:01.506
Look, Weezy, forget about
it, it's not important.

09:01.644 --> 09:05.683
And don't tell me you
send Christmas trees
to pay a loan.

09:05.821 --> 09:08.478
Well, you do if you borrow
it from a lumber company!

09:10.273 --> 09:11.585
Well, who lives at that
address, George?

09:11.723 --> 09:13.138
I wanna know what's going on.

09:13.276 --> 09:14.795
Look Weezy,
it's nothing, honest.

09:14.933 --> 09:16.245
Now, let's put the star
on the tree.

09:16.383 --> 09:18.005
George!

09:18.143 --> 09:19.455
Okay, then let's
answer the door!

09:20.767 --> 09:22.700
Ah, here they are.
They finally got here!

09:22.838 --> 09:24.598
The anniversary couple!

09:24.736 --> 09:26.255
Oh, Merry Christmas!

09:26.393 --> 09:27.912
Hey!
Hey, Pop!

09:29.707 --> 09:31.881
Oh, Lionel, it's so
good to see you.

09:32.019 --> 09:34.781
Mom, it's so good
to see you. Merry,
merry Christmas.

09:34.919 --> 09:36.610
Mama.

09:36.748 --> 09:37.853
Merry Christmas, baby.

09:37.991 --> 09:39.164
Daddy...

09:39.302 --> 09:42.064
Hi, lovey, Merry...
And watch out for my leg.

09:45.274 --> 09:48.760
Well, tell me, Lionel,
how does it feel to be
married for one year?

09:48.898 --> 09:50.037
Well...

09:51.211 --> 09:53.075
...feels like we're still
on our honeymoon.

09:54.317 --> 09:56.285
Except he sleeps more!

09:57.942 --> 10:00.979
Well, come on,
open your present.

10:01.117 --> 10:02.878
Oh!
It's from all of us.

10:03.257 --> 10:04.604
Mostly us.

10:10.471 --> 10:12.681
Oh Lionel, I don't believe it!

10:13.613 --> 10:15.200
They're plane tickets!

10:15.338 --> 10:16.926
To Bermuda!

10:17.064 --> 10:20.171
Ah, well...

10:20.309 --> 10:22.035
Helen, you traitor.

10:22.173 --> 10:24.140
Aw, I'm sorry, poopsie.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.662
We know that you both
have a vacation coming
up soon, so...

10:28.800 --> 10:32.666
Oh this is fabulous!
Oh, thank you!

10:33.667 --> 10:35.427
This is really a
great gift, Mom!

10:36.946 --> 10:38.603
Thank you!

10:38.741 --> 10:40.122
And who knows?

10:40.260 --> 10:42.780
A nice relaxing
place like that...

10:42.918 --> 10:46.680
Maybe sometime next
year we'll all have
a little grandchild.

10:46.818 --> 10:48.337
Ah, Mama.

10:48.475 --> 10:50.753
Look, you don't be
telling 'em what to do
on their vacation!

10:54.550 --> 10:57.104
What's the matter
with a grandchild?

10:57.242 --> 11:00.798
Wouldn't you like to see
a little George Jefferson
running around here?

11:00.936 --> 11:03.455
Yeah, that would
be kinda nice.

11:03.593 --> 11:06.044
Hey Lionel, y'all have
a ball in Bermuda.

11:10.704 --> 11:13.742
Now wait a minute!
It's my grandchild too.

11:13.880 --> 11:17.815
How do you know
there won't be a little Tom
Willis running around here?

11:17.953 --> 11:19.886
Forget it, Lionel, it
ain't worth the risk!

11:21.991 --> 11:26.271
Now, hold on. Now
this is a fabulous gift,
and we love it,

11:26.409 --> 11:28.377
but two of us are
going to Bermuda

11:28.515 --> 11:30.482
and only the two of
us are coming back.

11:30.620 --> 11:32.588
Well, you've been
married for one year now.

11:32.726 --> 11:35.108
It's time you start
thinking about children.

11:35.246 --> 11:38.939
Oh we do, Mother.
Every morning I
think about children...

11:39.077 --> 11:40.630
Then I take the pill.

11:42.943 --> 11:45.877
All right, everybody,
grab a glass.

11:46.015 --> 11:50.744
Now if this don't cure what
ails you, you ain't sick,
you dead!

11:55.300 --> 11:58.338
Oh, Lionel, would you mind
putting the star on top
of the tree for us?

11:58.476 --> 11:59.822
It's on the desk.

12:04.102 --> 12:06.484
Gotcha, Mom.

12:06.622 --> 12:10.626
Mmm, Florence, this eggnog is
delicious. What's your secret?

12:10.764 --> 12:13.077
Grade A eggs and
100 proof nog!

12:15.735 --> 12:18.289
Hey, Mom, do you want
me to put this gift
under the tree

12:18.427 --> 12:19.497
along with
the rest of them?

12:19.635 --> 12:21.188
Oh, what gift?

12:21.326 --> 12:24.260
Oh, I don't remember
that one. Who's it for?

12:24.398 --> 12:26.021
It doesn't say,
just an address.

12:26.159 --> 12:30.197
"984 West 124th Street,
Apartment 5C."

12:30.335 --> 12:32.199
What?

12:32.337 --> 12:34.857
That stupid Leroy!
He forgot to take the toy too.
Look, I gotta do it myself.

12:34.995 --> 12:37.308
George?
I gotta go Weezy.
This is important.

12:37.446 --> 12:41.761
But you can't leave now.
It's Christmas Eve and your
whole family's together.

12:41.899 --> 12:43.763
There's nothing more
important than that!

12:44.833 --> 12:47.007
Look, I'll be back
in a half hour.

13:03.403 --> 13:06.855
Okay, all set?

13:08.235 --> 13:09.202
Lovely.

13:09.340 --> 13:11.342
Louise, what do you think?

13:12.688 --> 13:14.966
Huh?
The tree.

13:15.104 --> 13:18.211
Oh, yeah, I think
it's beautiful!

13:19.108 --> 13:21.455
What's the matter, Louise?

13:21.593 --> 13:23.595
Get off of there,
old dumb spot.

13:25.943 --> 13:27.530
Still there.

13:28.980 --> 13:30.050
Aw, the heck with it!

13:30.188 --> 13:32.708
Oh, Florence!

13:32.846 --> 13:34.089
It was an old cup,
Mrs. Jefferson!

13:34.227 --> 13:36.298
I threw it away 'cause
it was cracked!

13:37.747 --> 13:39.094
You threw away a cup?

13:39.232 --> 13:40.371
Not if you didn't see me.

13:41.717 --> 13:43.063
Louise! What's wrong?

13:43.201 --> 13:44.237
It's George.

13:44.375 --> 13:46.342
It usually is.
Where'd he run off to?

13:46.480 --> 13:48.586
That's just it.
He won't tell me.

13:48.724 --> 13:51.416
Some place in Harlem
to deliver a toy.

13:51.554 --> 13:53.936
Oh, well, that sounds
innocent enough.

13:54.074 --> 13:55.835
And he sent a Christmas
tree there too.

13:55.973 --> 13:58.976
And he's been sending cash
every month for a long time.

13:59.114 --> 14:01.944
Well, uh, there could be a
lot of reasons for that...

14:02.082 --> 14:03.739
Couldn't there, Florence?

14:03.877 --> 14:05.983
Uh-huh. But you don't
wanna hear none of 'em!

14:10.884 --> 14:12.506
It's a woman.

14:12.644 --> 14:14.577
I don't think
Mr. Jefferson's got
a woman in Harlem.

14:14.715 --> 14:17.166
You don't?
Not if he sent a toy.

14:19.755 --> 14:21.136
That's right.

14:21.274 --> 14:23.138
I think he's got
a child in Harlem!

14:27.659 --> 14:29.661
What? I'll kill him!

14:29.799 --> 14:31.422
Now, Louise,
take it easy.

14:31.560 --> 14:35.909
I've been out there telling
Lionel to make a baby
and George beat him to it!

14:37.393 --> 14:39.188
I don't believe that.

14:39.326 --> 14:41.087
George is too old fashioned.

14:41.225 --> 14:44.504
Why he still believes
that a topless dancer
is a girl without a hat!

14:45.988 --> 14:48.715
Well, there's something
fishy going on there.

14:50.786 --> 14:53.375
Oh, you're just in time,
we're gonna sing
Christmas carols.

14:53.513 --> 14:55.273
Uh, not now, Lionel.
You go ahead...

14:55.411 --> 14:58.932
But Mom, we need you.
Nobody else around
here sings bass!

15:04.179 --> 15:06.767
Lionel, your mama don't
feel like it, now c'mon,
I'll sing with you.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.804
All right, Silent Night
on three.

15:10.219 --> 15:13.498
One, two, three, and...

15:13.636 --> 15:17.813
Silent night

15:17.951 --> 15:22.162
Holy night

15:22.300 --> 15:26.339
All is calm...

15:27.961 --> 15:29.376
Louise, where you going?

15:29.514 --> 15:31.171
To find my husband.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.794
But what about your party?

15:33.933 --> 15:35.865
First I got another
party to go to.

15:36.004 --> 15:39.559
The one at 984 West
124th Street.

15:39.697 --> 15:45.806
Holy infant
So tender and mild

16:00.614 --> 16:04.135
Hey, I saw you do that!

16:04.273 --> 16:05.412
Where'd you come from?

16:05.550 --> 16:08.346
Oh, just sittin' over
there in the corner.

16:08.484 --> 16:11.832
It's too cold in the
street this time of year.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.352
Damn! You ain't gotta
worry about gettin' cold.

16:14.490 --> 16:17.114
You got enough anti-freeze
in you to fill a snowplow!

16:18.287 --> 16:20.634
Oh, sorry, have a snort.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.498
No, thanks, my wine
drinking days are over.

16:22.636 --> 16:24.466
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

16:24.604 --> 16:28.263
This is the good stuff,
it was aged in the trucks.

16:28.401 --> 16:29.712
Look, I gotta go.

16:29.850 --> 16:31.335
Wait a minute.

16:31.473 --> 16:33.406
Don't I know you?
No.

16:33.544 --> 16:35.132
Maybe from a long time ago.

16:35.270 --> 16:36.823
I been around this
neighborhood

16:36.961 --> 16:38.480
a bunch of years.

16:38.618 --> 16:40.309
Yeah, a lotta people
get stuck here.

16:41.862 --> 16:46.729
Not me, brother. I came
to Harlem in 1936,

16:46.867 --> 16:48.386
with two dollars
in my pocket,

16:48.524 --> 16:52.011
and as soon as I get
even, I'm gonna leave!

16:57.809 --> 17:01.296
Well look, here's five
dollars, take a friend.

17:02.159 --> 17:03.367
Oh, thanks!

17:03.505 --> 17:05.783
So there you are!

17:05.921 --> 17:07.819
You better explain what
you're doing up here, buster,

17:07.957 --> 17:09.683
and you better
start talking fast!

17:09.821 --> 17:14.171
I was just minding my
own business when this guy
came down the hall...

17:14.309 --> 17:15.724
Not you, him.

17:15.862 --> 17:19.176
Oh. I don't know what
he's doing here.

17:19.314 --> 17:22.110
And I ain't staying
to find out either.

17:30.187 --> 17:31.878
What are you
doing here, Weez?

17:32.016 --> 17:33.949
I'm going to see your
friends in Apartment 5C.

17:34.087 --> 17:35.985
No, you're not!
Well, just try and stop me!

17:36.124 --> 17:38.643
Look Weezy, I don't know
who lives in there, and
they don't know me either.

17:38.781 --> 17:40.852
Ha! You expect me
to believe that?

17:40.990 --> 17:42.371
Have I ever lied
to you before?

17:42.509 --> 17:44.339
Yes.
When?

17:44.477 --> 17:48.515
Last year when you told me you
weren't opening a new store.

17:48.653 --> 17:49.792
Besides that.

17:49.930 --> 17:51.691
How 'bout the time when
you said your mother

17:51.829 --> 17:53.244
wasn't going to stay
with us for the weekend?

17:53.382 --> 17:55.764
Besides that.

17:55.902 --> 17:59.112
That time you promised me
you'd stop working nights.

17:59.630 --> 18:01.080
Besides that.

18:03.151 --> 18:04.669
I can't think of any more.

18:04.807 --> 18:07.155
A-ha, well look, the next
time you call me a liar,

18:07.293 --> 18:08.570
you better
have some facts!

18:09.191 --> 18:10.641
Now let's go...

18:10.779 --> 18:12.677
I'm not going anywhere!

18:12.815 --> 18:15.301
Would you stop acting
ignorant in the...
What are you yelling about?

18:15.439 --> 18:17.061
Uh, nothing. We
were just leaving.

18:17.199 --> 18:19.615
Hi. What's
your name?

18:19.753 --> 18:21.169
Warren. What's yours?

18:21.307 --> 18:23.447
Louise. And you know him?

18:23.930 --> 18:25.518
No, I don't.

18:25.656 --> 18:26.795
Are you sure?

18:26.933 --> 18:29.315
Lady, how could I forget
a face like that?

18:33.077 --> 18:34.941
Come here, Warren.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.774
What are you
doin' now, Weez?

18:42.155 --> 18:44.261
Nah! Couldn't be!

18:45.469 --> 18:47.402
Hey, look!

18:47.540 --> 18:50.922
Mom, Dad!
He was here!
He was here!

18:51.060 --> 18:52.338
Did you see who left this?

18:52.476 --> 18:54.340
Uh-uh! He ran by too fast.

18:54.478 --> 18:55.824
He didn't look nothing
like me, though.

18:55.962 --> 18:57.515
He was fat, and ugly!

18:57.653 --> 18:59.345
Warren, what are you
doing out here?

18:59.483 --> 19:01.795
Oh, hi. Something I
can do for you?

19:01.933 --> 19:03.797
Uh, no. We just came to
visit some of our friends

19:03.935 --> 19:05.454
but they wasn't home,
so we were just leaving.

19:05.592 --> 19:06.835
Aw, that's too bad.

19:06.973 --> 19:08.423
Could we come in and wait?

19:08.561 --> 19:10.459
I hope your friends will
be back in a little while.

19:10.597 --> 19:12.392
Weezy...
I don't know if that'll
be a good idea or not.

19:12.530 --> 19:15.050
Oh honey, I think
it's alright.

19:15.188 --> 19:16.741
It's Christmas.

19:18.295 --> 19:20.020
Yeah, come on in.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.333
Oh, thank you.

19:22.471 --> 19:25.371
Look, Mom. I'm gonna put
it under the tree.

19:25.509 --> 19:27.235
We're Sherry and
William Barnes.

19:27.373 --> 19:29.720
Louise and George Jefferson.

19:29.858 --> 19:31.618
Sit down, please make
yourselves at home...

19:37.797 --> 19:39.178
George?

19:40.800 --> 19:42.905
Are you okay, man?

19:43.043 --> 19:44.976
What's the matter?

19:45.114 --> 19:47.013
I used to live here.

19:47.151 --> 19:49.774
Well, that's the best thing
you can say about this
neighborhood...

19:49.912 --> 19:51.362
"I used to live here."

19:52.398 --> 19:54.296
No, I mean right here,
in the same apartment.

19:54.434 --> 19:55.401
What?

19:55.539 --> 19:57.265
'Til I was about 12.

19:57.403 --> 19:59.301
Well, ain't that something?

19:59.439 --> 20:02.028
Hey, looks like you made
it outta here in style.

20:02.166 --> 20:03.512
Yeah, it sure
ain't changed much.

20:03.650 --> 20:05.065
It never does.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.965
And this is after the landlord
renovated the place last year.

20:08.103 --> 20:10.139
'Course you know what
renovation means around here.

20:10.278 --> 20:12.590
He swept the halls
and raised the rent.

20:14.627 --> 20:16.318
Sounds like you got
the same landlord.

20:16.456 --> 20:17.699
Yeah.

20:17.837 --> 20:22.428
I don't believe it, George.
This is where you grew up.

20:22.566 --> 20:25.914
Yeah, everything seemed
a lot bigger back then.

20:26.052 --> 20:29.055
Of course it did.
You were smaller.

20:29.193 --> 20:31.471
Hey, look! It's still here,
after all these years!

20:31.609 --> 20:36.200
"G.J. loves P.V."
George Jefferson loves
Paula Vincent.

20:36.338 --> 20:37.788
She was great, mmm.

20:37.926 --> 20:40.618
We always wondered
who they were.

20:40.756 --> 20:43.587
And what was so great
about Paula Vincent?

20:43.725 --> 20:46.037
She was the only girl I could
get to play doctor with me.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.559
Doctor?

20:50.697 --> 20:53.182
Don't worry about it, Weezy.
My father caught us before

20:53.321 --> 20:54.839
I could get her on the
operating table.

20:58.222 --> 21:00.569
Well, good for him.

21:00.707 --> 21:03.710
Yeah, my father used
to have his big chair
right here,

21:03.848 --> 21:05.264
with a spring sticking out.

21:05.402 --> 21:07.438
I remember one time,
he slapped me hard

21:07.576 --> 21:09.198
and then he slammed
me down to the chair

21:09.337 --> 21:11.442
and I bounced all the way
out into the kitchen!

21:11.580 --> 21:15.274
The kitchen! Oh no,
I forgot my cookies!

21:16.930 --> 21:18.932
What kind of work
did your daddy do?

21:19.070 --> 21:23.074
Anything for a buck, but
his main job was swinging a
pick digging in the streets.

21:23.212 --> 21:25.836
Hey, no jivin' man? That's
what I do when I can get it.

21:25.974 --> 21:29.495
Oh yeah? It really built
up his muscles. Boy,
could he hit hard.

21:31.324 --> 21:32.808
It must come with the job.

21:34.396 --> 21:36.916
Yeah, old dad used to sit
over there readin' the paper,

21:37.054 --> 21:39.056
and Mama was always in
the kitchen yelling.

21:39.194 --> 21:42.059
SHERRY: Oh, damn, I
burned the cookies!
That was Mama, all right!

21:43.785 --> 21:46.374
Yeah, but that was a
long, long time ago.

21:46.512 --> 21:49.377
Honey, look at this,
all burnt.

21:50.895 --> 21:54.209
That's okay. They'll cool
off in my stomach.

21:56.867 --> 21:58.938
Well, we better get
going, Weez.

21:59.076 --> 22:03.218
Oh, George is right.
Our whole family is
waiting at home for us.

22:03.356 --> 22:05.185
Wait, wait a minute.

22:07.291 --> 22:08.499
For you.

22:08.637 --> 22:11.122
We always keep an extra
present under the tree.

22:11.260 --> 22:13.228
It's just a box of candy.

22:13.366 --> 22:16.162
Oh, no, we couldn't.
You can't afford...

22:16.300 --> 22:18.406
Oh yes, yes, we can.

22:18.544 --> 22:21.443
See, we have our
own private Santa Claus.

22:21.581 --> 22:22.755
What?

22:22.893 --> 22:25.067
We don't know who he is,
or why he's doing it,

22:25.205 --> 22:28.277
but about five years ago
somebody started sending
us things.

22:28.416 --> 22:29.969
Oh, really?

22:30.107 --> 22:31.488
Sounds crazy, don't it?

22:31.626 --> 22:33.973
Yeah it does.
C'mon, Weez.

22:34.111 --> 22:36.907
First it was a tree
and a present for Warren
at Christmas.

22:37.045 --> 22:38.874
And then $100 every month!

22:39.012 --> 22:40.428
And did we need
the money then!

22:40.566 --> 22:41.774
We were down to
one meal a day.

22:41.912 --> 22:43.431
And that day was Wednesday!

22:43.569 --> 22:45.433
But now we're both
working pretty regular,

22:45.571 --> 22:48.746
so I been using part
of the money to take
a course in TV repair.

22:48.884 --> 22:51.335
See we figure if William
can just get a job like that,

22:51.473 --> 22:54.269
maybe someday we can get
outta here for good.

22:54.407 --> 22:57.168
I'm sure you'll do it, too.

22:57.306 --> 22:59.757
Can we go home now, Weezy?
Yes, George.

22:59.895 --> 23:02.277
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

23:08.214 --> 23:12.494
George, that was the nicest
thing I ever heard.

23:12.632 --> 23:14.979
I've never been
prouder of you.

23:15.117 --> 23:16.878
Yeah, okay, Weezy.

23:17.016 --> 23:18.845
Uh, George.

23:18.983 --> 23:21.054
Aren't you going to tell
me why you're doing it?

23:22.918 --> 23:24.264
Does it matter?

23:24.403 --> 23:27.475
No, but I'd like to know.

23:27.613 --> 23:31.306
Well, there were a lot
of bad Christmases in
this apartment,

23:31.444 --> 23:34.758
and you know, sometimes
we didn't have presents,
or tree, or nothin'.

23:34.896 --> 23:36.898
I mean, you know how
that makes a kid feel?

23:37.036 --> 23:38.762
I sure do.

23:38.900 --> 23:41.109
So, I made a promise that,
uh, if I ever made it big,

23:41.247 --> 23:43.491
there would never be no
more bad Christmases
in this apartment.

23:43.629 --> 23:47.046
I mean, Weezy, now,
people shouldn't have
to live like this,

23:47.184 --> 23:48.703
so I'm just keeping
a promise.

23:48.841 --> 23:52.534
But something like that
you don't have to keep
secret, George.

23:52.672 --> 23:55.537
Why didn't you ever tell me?
Or them?

23:55.675 --> 23:58.264
'Cause it's personal.

23:58.402 --> 24:01.543
Look, it's not that it's a
gift or anything, it's just,

24:01.681 --> 24:04.097
something that I owe.

24:05.927 --> 24:08.723
Look, just because you get
outta here don't mean you
forget the place.

24:08.861 --> 24:10.345
I mean, you gotta
put something back.

24:12.347 --> 24:14.901
Merry Christmas, George.

24:17.145 --> 24:18.698
Merry Christmas, Weez.

24:47.693 --> 24:51.835
LOUISE: The Jeffersons
was videotaped in front
of a studio audience.
