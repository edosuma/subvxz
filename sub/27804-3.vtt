WEBVTT

00:09.092 --> 00:10.468
[man] We're up in Aspen.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.763
We're scheduled for a preliminary hearing.

00:14.848 --> 00:18.309
I think Bundy was the only case
on the criminal docket that morning.

00:19.227 --> 00:21.688
I thought the court proceedings
were going very well.

00:22.272 --> 00:24.607
We took the morning recess as always.

00:24.691 --> 00:28.111
So we went our separate directions.
I was out in the hallway

00:28.194 --> 00:30.447
smoking a cigarette,
talking to one of the deputies...

00:31.656 --> 00:34.367
and Ted was in the back of the courtroom,

00:34.826 --> 00:36.578
where the law library is.

00:36.661 --> 00:38.121
He was doing research.

00:40.373 --> 00:43.543
I was sitting out in the hallway,
having a cigarette,

00:43.626 --> 00:46.838
when the Sheriff's deputy came along
and asked if I knew where Bundy was.

00:47.464 --> 00:50.967
My approach to things like that
is usually pretty whimsical,

00:51.051 --> 00:52.635
and I thought that was funny.

00:52.719 --> 00:55.555
And I said, "It's not really my turn
to watch him."

00:56.014 --> 00:59.392
And the next thing I know,
everybody's running into the courthouse.

01:01.227 --> 01:02.771
Somebody from the first floor came up

01:02.854 --> 01:04.731
and said somebody jumped out
of the second floor window.

01:05.523 --> 01:07.859
Before anybody knew, he was gone.

01:08.651 --> 01:11.780
And, uh, that was it
for the court proceedings for the day.

01:13.865 --> 01:15.658
[theme song playing]

01:33.718 --> 01:35.845
[opening song playing]

01:38.473 --> 01:42.477
Good evening. Convicted Utah kidnapper
Theodore Bundy has escaped.

01:42.560 --> 01:45.271
Escaped from an Aspen,
Colorado courtroom

01:45.730 --> 01:48.650
and remains, at this hour,
the subject of a manhunt.

01:51.820 --> 01:56.074
What happened was seemingly inane
but it's what took place.

01:56.157 --> 01:58.993
He jumped out of the courthouse
and he was gone.

01:59.577 --> 02:01.037
[tires screech]

02:01.871 --> 02:03.164
And the next thing I know,

02:03.248 --> 02:06.334
the Sheriffs were running out
of the courthouse and down the street.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.795
I mean, they took off trying to find him.

02:08.878 --> 02:11.214
It-- It was kind of a surreal experience.

02:11.756 --> 02:14.717
[Lucas] I was there in Aspen
after his escape from the courthouse.

02:14.801 --> 02:19.556
Obviously, they weren't paying attention
to how significant this serial killer was.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.474
That was irresponsible.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.601
It's one of those things
that shouldn't have happened.

02:23.685 --> 02:27.105
[reporter] Guards waited outside the room
but Bundy was alone inside

02:27.188 --> 02:31.442
when he decided to open that window
and jump the 25 feet to the ground.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.987
In fact, you can still see
the indentations in the grass here,

02:34.070 --> 02:35.321
where he landed.

02:35.405 --> 02:38.074
From here, Theodore Bundy
decided to head for the hills.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.161
[Leidner]
There was nobody looking after him.

02:41.244 --> 02:43.746
He wasn't shackled, he wasn't chained,
he wasn't handcuffed.

02:43.830 --> 02:48.376
They didn't have a waist chain on him
and they kind of let him roam freely

02:48.918 --> 02:50.670
throughout the, uh-- the courtroom.

02:51.421 --> 02:52.797
It was inconceivable to me

02:52.881 --> 02:55.758
that you would have somebody
accused of first-degree murder,

02:55.842 --> 02:58.011
who by that time
was thought to be involved

02:58.094 --> 03:00.138
in a series of murders
throughout the West,

03:00.221 --> 03:02.599
and that your security level
would be so low.

03:02.682 --> 03:05.518
I really don't know what happened
this morning in terms of the guard.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.812
Basically, uh, as I understand it,

03:07.896 --> 03:10.440
the defendant was in the courtroom
and, uh...

03:11.941 --> 03:13.610
the guard was at the door

03:13.693 --> 03:15.737
and the last time he looked,
the defendant was there,

03:15.820 --> 03:18.114
and the next he looked, he was gone.
[chuckles]

03:18.198 --> 03:19.949
So he didn't keep him inside at all times?

03:20.033 --> 03:23.369
-Apparently not.
-Will he be disciplined for that?

03:23.453 --> 03:25.538
[chuckles] I assume so.

03:28.833 --> 03:31.336
[Bundy]
I remember the beautiful, clear morning.

03:33.087 --> 03:36.007
The mountain top shining
with the first rays of...

03:36.674 --> 03:39.344
the summer morning's light.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.933
I remember psyching myself all the way up

03:45.016 --> 03:47.435
saying to myself again and again,
"You must go.

03:47.518 --> 03:49.062
You must go, you must go, you must go.

03:49.145 --> 03:51.189
Don't hesitate, don't stop, don't stop."

03:53.900 --> 03:56.069
[Leidner] The question is,
does he know where he's going?

03:56.152 --> 03:58.279
Does he know anything
about this area?

03:58.363 --> 04:01.032
There's only two roads out of Aspen.

04:01.449 --> 04:03.701
How is he going to get out of here?

04:04.244 --> 04:06.621
[reporter] Roadblocks have been set up
all around Aspen.

04:06.704 --> 04:09.999
City police and Pitkin County
Sheriff's deputies are checking every car

04:10.083 --> 04:11.751
leaving this mountain community.

04:14.128 --> 04:17.131
[reporter #2] So far these roadblocks
have turned up no sign of Ted Bundy,

04:17.882 --> 04:20.301
but sources report nine others
have been arrested

04:20.385 --> 04:22.011
in connection with other cases

04:22.095 --> 04:25.515
and officers have confiscated
200 pounds of marijuana.

04:26.307 --> 04:29.811
[Lucas] It was crazy.
The cops didn't know what was going on.

04:29.894 --> 04:32.021
We'd go around talking to the police
about the escape,

04:32.105 --> 04:34.065
"What do you know about it?"
And nothing.

04:34.148 --> 04:37.193
My photographer and I spent hours
driving up and down in the woods,

04:37.277 --> 04:40.113
combing the hill trying to--
to locate this idiot.

04:43.866 --> 04:45.618
[Leidner]
People were showing up on horseback

04:45.702 --> 04:49.163
with the bandoleros
strung across their chest, with rifles

04:49.247 --> 04:51.874
probably half lit,
ready to go out and hunt Bundy.

04:51.958 --> 04:55.545
[reporter] The Sheriff's department said
150 men and five bloodhounds

04:55.628 --> 04:57.422
combed the canyons around Aspen.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.258
[Lubeck] This was
a catch-me-if-you-can game

05:00.341 --> 05:01.551
that he was engaged in,

05:01.634 --> 05:06.723
and he was interested in one thing,
and that is doing what he wanted.

05:06.931 --> 05:08.182
[dog sniffing]

05:08.266 --> 05:09.934
[Bundy] It certainly did cause a furor.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.478
They didn't know where in the world I was.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.565
And I was feeling really good.

05:15.648 --> 05:18.318
I had nobody helping me,
I had no money, I had no nothing.

05:18.943 --> 05:21.321
[reporter] Using the scent
from a sweater Bundy left behind,

05:21.404 --> 05:24.949
dogs did track him to a bridge in town,
then they lost the trail.

05:26.117 --> 05:28.077
[Bundy]
Just ran right up into the mountains

05:28.786 --> 05:30.288
and managed to find a cabin.

05:36.169 --> 05:39.881
[reporter] The search around Aspen,
now in its third day, is being wound down.

05:39.964 --> 05:42.425
But the spokesman
for the Pitkin County Sheriff's Department

05:42.508 --> 05:45.136
says the dragnet will definitely continue.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.805
[Michaud] For days and days and days,

05:47.889 --> 05:53.603
he kept the level of interest
and the guessing... uh, going.

05:54.562 --> 05:57.190
At that point, the FBI entered the case

05:57.273 --> 06:01.027
because Bundy became an interstate
fugitive fleeing from justice.

06:01.903 --> 06:06.783
They could throw a lot of bodies
and equipment at the investigation,

06:07.408 --> 06:09.494
manpower, vehicles.

06:09.577 --> 06:13.331
But even then, the FBI was not much help.

06:13.456 --> 06:17.251
They didn't know anything
that the locals didn't already know.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.883
[Bundy] If I could've kept on hiking
I would have been long gone

06:23.966 --> 06:27.720
but a very cold sleet and rain storm
hit me

06:27.804 --> 06:31.349
and I got very cold
and went into a state of shock.

06:32.266 --> 06:36.646
Three, four days of high altitude
and cold got to me and my mind got weak.

06:37.688 --> 06:39.315
I was just totally disoriented.

06:39.399 --> 06:43.152
It was like an experience
I had never known before.

06:44.779 --> 06:47.240
That night I went and walked
back into Aspen

06:47.323 --> 06:48.866
because I was cold and hungry.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.036
And I just said, "Well,
let's just see what happens."

06:52.120 --> 06:54.664
And a fluke actually, they stopped me.

07:01.712 --> 07:05.716
[camera shutters clicking,
reporters shouting indistinctly]

07:06.300 --> 07:08.344
[reporter]
Streets of Aspen are safe again.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.721
Suspected multiple murderer
Theodore Bundy

07:10.805 --> 07:14.308
is back in custody after an absence
of nearly seven days.

07:17.728 --> 07:21.315
Bundy came here Wednesday after spending
a miserable night in the rain.

07:21.399 --> 07:25.903
He told officers he broke into this cabin,
where he ate and slept Wednesday night.

07:26.487 --> 07:28.573
Then last night, Bundy said
he walked into Aspen,

07:28.656 --> 07:31.909
took this car which was unlocked
and had the keys in the ignition.

07:32.410 --> 07:35.705
He was on his way out of town
but for some reason made a U-turn.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.540
That's when Bundy was apprehended.

07:38.332 --> 07:41.377
I noted a vehicle driving erratically

07:42.003 --> 07:45.131
about an eighth of a mile east of Aspen
on highway 82.

07:45.923 --> 07:47.842
We observed this vehicle
for a matter of seconds,

07:47.925 --> 07:51.637
and I turned around and pursued it,
contacted it,

07:52.346 --> 07:54.932
and found Mr. Bundy driving it.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.101
[woman] Did you recognize him right away?

07:57.185 --> 08:00.188
It took about two glances.
He was pretty... altered,

08:00.271 --> 08:02.940
his appearance had been altered
by glasses and, uh...

08:03.733 --> 08:05.318
a minor growth of beard.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.779
[reporter] When Ted Bundy emerged
from the courtroom,

08:08.863 --> 08:10.239
he was barefoot, haggard.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.951
He limped from the blisters on his feet
and he weighed 25 pounds less

08:14.035 --> 08:16.746
than he did last Tuesday,
at the time of his escape.

08:16.829 --> 08:20.208
[Lucas] When he was recaptured in Aspen,
there in the courthouse in the crowd,

08:20.291 --> 08:23.544
in that famous shot where Bundy is walking
into that crowd of reporters,

08:23.920 --> 08:26.589
he came past me,
turned to me and said, "Hi, Ward."

08:27.840 --> 08:31.969
And two or three of the reporters standing
around me said, "Who the hell are you?"

08:33.054 --> 08:36.432
It was very odd. But he obviously
had been watching or listening

08:36.933 --> 08:41.812
paying attention to any time his name
was used on the air, or in print.

08:41.896 --> 08:43.272
[camera shutter clicks]

08:43.981 --> 08:46.776
He was a narcissist
along with being a psychopath,

08:46.859 --> 08:49.362
so I think he watched
every TV newscast he could.

08:49.695 --> 08:52.573
I wouldn't be surprised if he saved
newspaper clippings.

08:52.990 --> 08:55.201
Some people with his mindset do.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.748
[Bundy] I know
of course the officers believed

09:00.831 --> 09:03.876
that I would be depressed.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.586
Dejected as well as...

09:06.295 --> 09:08.839
in a state of physical exhaustion.

09:09.173 --> 09:10.258
And that...

09:11.259 --> 09:13.344
the inevitability of it all would

09:13.427 --> 09:16.013
shake me and that I was just a...

09:16.264 --> 09:18.599
a rotten tomato ready to burst.

09:19.433 --> 09:21.018
And all it would take would be

09:21.102 --> 09:23.938
this extraordinary circumstance
to open me up.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.733
But my exhaustion notwithstanding,

09:29.193 --> 09:31.112
they were barking up the wrong tree.

09:33.322 --> 09:35.783
[Carlisle]
Once he got caught and he was in jail,

09:36.284 --> 09:38.869
he called-- He had a credit card
that he could use.

09:39.370 --> 09:44.333
And he called and we talked
and talked for about 15 minutes or so.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.670
-[Bundy] How you doing?
-Doing pretty good, Ted. How you doing?

09:47.753 --> 09:50.423
[Bundy]
Uh, well, quite well, quite frankly, yeah.

09:50.756 --> 09:53.509
[stammering] There is still the scars
from the blisters on my feet.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.928
-I'm sitting here bare footed. [laughs]
-Uh-uh.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.930
[Bundy]
From running around in the mountains.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.432
Extraordinary experience.

09:59.890 --> 10:02.226
-[Carlisle] They treating you pretty good?
-Um...

10:02.310 --> 10:04.854
They, they have developed
this paranoia about me.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.023
-Like I am going to escape or something.
-[chuckles]

10:07.106 --> 10:08.858
I can't imagine
where they are getting that.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.693
[Bundy laughs]

10:10.776 --> 10:12.737
-Yes, exactly.
-Uh-uh.

10:13.779 --> 10:16.365
[Bundy] You know, we haven't really...
[clears throat]

10:16.449 --> 10:20.453
you know, talked personally, obviously,
since the latter part of January.

10:20.536 --> 10:21.454
[Carlisle] Yeah, right.

10:21.537 --> 10:24.957
[Bundy] Well, the impressions of all that
you have been hearing about me

10:25.041 --> 10:26.417
and you know, the...

10:26.709 --> 10:28.002
[Carlisle] Okay. How do you mean?

10:28.085 --> 10:30.296
[Bundy] Well, like, the escape
and everything like that.

10:31.088 --> 10:33.674
I wonder
what your impression of that was.

10:33.758 --> 10:34.675
[Carlisle] Uh...

10:35.301 --> 10:36.594
I had mixed impressions.

10:36.677 --> 10:39.221
I was wondering
if you were really getting uptight.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.349
And the pressure looked like it was on.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.268
In your own mind, what was happening?

10:44.352 --> 10:46.479
-[Bundy] Well...
-What was the reason for...

10:46.562 --> 10:49.899
[Bundy] I just got sick and tired
of being locked up, and...

10:50.316 --> 10:53.027
I had-- Over the months,
I had noticed a number of opportunities

10:53.110 --> 10:54.779
to just walk right out.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.949
Just longed for freedom for so long
and now I'm like...

10:59.450 --> 11:01.535
like I was living my ultimate dream.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.996
It was just an incredible experience.

11:04.747 --> 11:08.250
[Carlisle]
It's almost like he's talking to a father

11:08.334 --> 11:11.379
and saying, you know:
"I almost did a home run".

11:12.421 --> 11:14.548
You know, in the baseball game.
It was so friendly.

11:14.965 --> 11:16.550
He was really quite proud of that.

11:18.469 --> 11:22.181
[Leidner] He talked about how lucky
the people were to catch him,

11:22.515 --> 11:24.850
and how stupid the people were
who caught him...

11:25.518 --> 11:26.727
and how...

11:27.353 --> 11:30.147
intellectually superior he was
to everybody.

11:30.564 --> 11:32.358
And I thought to myself,

11:32.441 --> 11:34.443
"Those things may be true
but you're the one in jail,

11:34.527 --> 11:36.320
and those are the ones
who are on the outside."

11:38.781 --> 11:41.325
[reporter] Theodore Bundy left here
in the midst of a hearing

11:41.409 --> 11:43.411
concerning his upcoming murder trial.

11:43.494 --> 11:44.912
If that's what he hoped to avoid,

11:44.995 --> 11:46.872
he didn't really accomplish much
by escaping.

11:47.331 --> 11:50.167
He's back in jail,
that hearing resumes Thursday morning,

11:50.251 --> 11:52.837
and now Bundy faces new charges...
of escape.

11:54.463 --> 11:56.799
[Michaud] This is one
of those strange dichotomies with Ted.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.467
He liked being the center of attention,

11:58.551 --> 12:01.178
but did not understand
what kind of trouble came with it.

12:02.138 --> 12:07.351
The better known he was, the more
he put himself under undue risk...

12:08.686 --> 12:11.856
but Ted did not see it that way.

12:15.693 --> 12:19.864
[Bundy] This kind of boldness that we see
from time to time from this personality,

12:20.322 --> 12:21.157
um...

12:21.532 --> 12:25.035
it's probably just being willing
to take the risk.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.829
Or perhaps not even seeing risk.

12:27.288 --> 12:31.751
Just overcome by that boldness and desire
to accomplish a particular thing.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.795
To understand how he thought,

12:34.879 --> 12:38.424
you have to be able to project yourself
into a sociopath's brain.

12:38.507 --> 12:40.634
If you can do that, um...

12:41.093 --> 12:42.720
more power to you. [chuckles]

12:42.803 --> 12:44.930
I'm-- It's a point of pride with me
that I can't.

12:47.475 --> 12:51.937
[Bundy] I think we can say that he--
he felt almost as if he was immune...

12:52.229 --> 12:53.647
-[Michaud] Mm-hmm.
-...uh...

12:54.440 --> 12:56.275
from detection,
as if he were in a dimension

12:56.358 --> 12:59.445
that he just kind of, like,
could walk through doors.

13:00.237 --> 13:02.948
That he had some supernatural powers.

13:03.699 --> 13:06.577
That no matter how much he fucked up,
nothing could go wrong.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.007
[Michaud] December 30th, 1977,

13:20.883 --> 13:25.721
Ted is in prison waiting for trial
for the murder of Caryn Campbell.

13:27.348 --> 13:31.977
That evening a guard, as usual,
brought him his food and left.

13:35.105 --> 13:38.067
The next morning,
the guard returned to Ted's cell,

13:40.152 --> 13:41.862
and found his food uneaten.

13:43.572 --> 13:47.243
He looked over and Bundy appeared
to be in his cot, asleep.

13:48.911 --> 13:51.622
But as he entered the cell
and pulled back the covers,

13:51.705 --> 13:55.125
he finds nothings but a pile of books,
where Ted should have been.

13:55.751 --> 13:57.002
There was no Bundy.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.257
[indistinct shouting]

14:04.552 --> 14:07.137
[reporter] New Year's Eve, 1977.

14:09.890 --> 14:13.310
In the Garfield County Jail,
Bundy walked out.

14:13.644 --> 14:16.981
[female reporter] Bundy starved down
to less than 140 pounds,

14:17.147 --> 14:20.609
slipped through a hole in the ceiling
of his cell and was free again.

14:23.988 --> 14:27.658
[McChesney]
The second escape, Ted was quite creative.

14:27.741 --> 14:32.371
Lost some weight,
and hacked his way through the ceiling.

14:32.788 --> 14:37.334
He managed to climb on some books,
lift himself into the ceiling,

14:37.418 --> 14:39.128
crawl through the ceiling area,

14:39.211 --> 14:45.759
into the apartment of one of the jailers,
which was above his prison cell.

14:46.427 --> 14:50.931
He took some of the jailer's clothing
and walked out the front door.

14:56.645 --> 14:59.732
[Keppel] Bundy's second escape
was pretty much of a nightmare.

15:01.442 --> 15:04.695
That's the one where he just disappeared
and no one knew where he went.

15:06.196 --> 15:07.615
[Leidner] Just could not believe it,

15:07.698 --> 15:09.950
could not believe
that somehow he got out of there.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.202
That's what really was a scary situation.

15:14.288 --> 15:18.000
[Lucas] I was so disgusted
with what had gone on.

15:18.459 --> 15:19.460
I think it was a travesty.

15:20.502 --> 15:22.421
The county commissioners of course
are responsible

15:22.504 --> 15:24.757
ultimately for the safety of prisoners.

15:25.215 --> 15:27.968
The safekeeping of prisoners
in a county facility.

15:28.344 --> 15:29.678
They were derelict in their duty.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.598
I can assure you
that if anybody has been harmed

15:32.681 --> 15:36.769
by Mr. Bundy's leaving Garfield County
on the first of January,

15:36.852 --> 15:39.146
that I intend fully to follow up

15:39.229 --> 15:43.067
uh, and file charges against people
who were perhaps criminally negligent.

15:44.443 --> 15:47.446
[Leidner] It just brought to mind
a little kid who's been denied

15:47.529 --> 15:49.323
candy for however much time,

15:50.157 --> 15:51.533
and this situation,

15:51.617 --> 15:54.036
it was like Bundy
couldn't control himself.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.996
He had this opportunity

15:56.080 --> 15:57.957
and took off.

15:59.041 --> 16:02.252
[Lucas] He was this vicious killer
who was just a complete and total con man,

16:02.336 --> 16:05.214
a psychopath.
And he was running around out there.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.924
People began looking everywhere,

16:07.007 --> 16:09.468
because a serial killer doesn't quit
until he is stopped.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.475
[Yocom]
I got a call from the local authorities

16:16.558 --> 16:19.019
saying that Ted had escaped again.

16:19.561 --> 16:22.523
We were afraid that he might be
coming back to the Salt Lake area

16:22.606 --> 16:24.984
and we certainly didn't want him
back there. [chuckles]

16:26.735 --> 16:29.780
[woman]
I heard about the escape on the news.

16:30.322 --> 16:33.826
I was concerned with him being loose,

16:33.909 --> 16:37.329
on what was going to happen
to someone else.

16:37.413 --> 16:42.084
Just the magnitude of it
was just very overwhelming and shocking.

16:42.543 --> 16:45.546
Well, I'm concerned that this individual
has been on the street,

16:45.629 --> 16:48.924
and we of course take
all necessary precautions and, uh...

16:49.591 --> 16:52.761
with our witnesses that testified
against him in our case here...

16:52.845 --> 16:56.265
and of course will assist any way we can
with Colorado to...

16:56.682 --> 16:58.475
um, see that he's apprehended.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.522
[female reporter] Are you worried
that he might hurt somebody else?

17:03.981 --> 17:05.482
Well, there's always this possibility.

17:06.859 --> 17:11.280
[Keppel] There's law enforcement officers
in Idaho, Colorado, Utah...

17:11.363 --> 17:13.032
all investigating Bundy.

17:14.283 --> 17:17.369
So we contacted everybody
we could think of.

17:17.786 --> 17:21.540
Liz, his friends, his mother.

17:21.623 --> 17:24.543
Basically threatened them all with arrest,

17:24.626 --> 17:27.004
all in an effort to try and get them

17:27.087 --> 17:29.423
to tell us everything they could
about Bundy.

17:29.506 --> 17:31.175
[siren wailing]

17:31.258 --> 17:32.760
Was he coming this way?

17:32.843 --> 17:34.553
We didn't know if he was or not.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.100
[male reporter]
Assistant US Attorney James McConkey

17:40.184 --> 17:41.769
approved processing the document,

17:41.852 --> 17:44.313
which brings
the Federal Bureau of Investigation

17:44.396 --> 17:46.065
into the hunt for Ted Bundy.

17:46.857 --> 17:50.444
[man] Wanted for questioning in connection
with similar type sexual slayings

17:50.527 --> 17:54.281
throughout the Pacific northwest
and into Utah and Colorado.

17:54.364 --> 17:59.411
A federal warrant was issued on January 5,
1978 at Denver, Colorado,

17:59.870 --> 18:01.497
charging Bundy with unlawful flight

18:01.580 --> 18:03.582
to avoid prosecution
for the crime of murder.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.918
[Lucas] If Bundy is ever recaptured,

18:06.001 --> 18:08.170
the Colorado prosecution will continue,

18:08.253 --> 18:10.506
and he could be prosecuted
for one of the Utah murders

18:10.589 --> 18:12.382
before this thing is all over with.

18:12.466 --> 18:17.054
But for the moment, Theodore Bundy
is merely an escaped convicted kidnapper.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.265
And now one of the FBI's most wanted men.

18:22.142 --> 18:24.144
[McChesney] Even with the FBI involved,

18:24.228 --> 18:26.480
sharing information was a real challenge.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.733
There was no central database.

18:30.150 --> 18:31.235
There was no Internet.

18:31.318 --> 18:32.152
[phone rings]

18:32.236 --> 18:35.656
[Michaud] The FBI were limited
in their reach to the general public.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.075
In those days, there was always a delay

18:38.158 --> 18:40.202
between what happened
and getting the story.

18:41.161 --> 18:44.123
And so Ted was just a legend
in his own time zone.

18:45.916 --> 18:49.378
[Bundy] The FBI knows that people
are creatures of habit...

18:49.795 --> 18:53.715
that we have our little things
that we like to do.

18:56.593 --> 19:02.975
And they just wait for a person
to assume those habits again.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.688
The person has to examine his life
and say,

19:08.230 --> 19:11.984
"What parts of my life are distinctive?"
And then change them.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.321
Creating an identity...

19:18.532 --> 19:23.829
is-- is not terribly difficult
to do at all.

19:33.589 --> 19:36.967
Frightened coeds
at Florida State University in Tallahassee

19:37.050 --> 19:39.178
walked to class in groups today

19:39.261 --> 19:41.096
while detectives tried to track a man

19:41.180 --> 19:45.017
who slipped into a sorority house
early yesterday and murdered two women.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.855
[reporter] In the early morning hours,
through a backdoor,

19:49.938 --> 19:52.524
the Intruder came in,
carrying an oak tree limb

19:53.108 --> 19:54.943
[reporter #2]
The killer came in from the night,

19:55.027 --> 19:59.072
and then returned to it with an ease
that has so far baffled police

19:59.156 --> 20:01.617
and left most coeds here terrified.

20:02.910 --> 20:06.121
[man] It all began at about 2:30 a.m.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.248
A call I'll never forget.

20:08.624 --> 20:11.627
The frantic nature of the...

20:12.211 --> 20:16.506
caller on the other end of the phone
saying, "Sheriff, uh...

20:17.132 --> 20:19.509
we may have as many as four dead

20:20.219 --> 20:23.555
at the Chi Omega sorority house,
Florida State University."

20:24.056 --> 20:26.225
-[sirens wailing]
-[indistinct chatter]

20:26.642 --> 20:31.271
As I arrived, they were taking girls out
on stretchers.

20:31.855 --> 20:34.608
I didn't know,
and frankly they didn't either,

20:34.691 --> 20:36.276
whether they were dead or alive.

20:38.403 --> 20:42.115
It appeared that the person
was attempting to be organized

20:42.199 --> 20:46.161
like it was necessary
to do things in order.

20:46.703 --> 20:49.706
[reporter] Most Chi Os had come back
from their dates and gone to bed.

20:50.082 --> 20:53.585
That's where the intruder found
Margaret Bowman asleep.

20:54.002 --> 20:55.254
She never woke up.

20:55.337 --> 20:59.132
She died in her bed,
beaten, strangled, sexually molested.

21:00.634 --> 21:04.721
[Katsaris] But you could tell
that the person that did this

21:05.264 --> 21:07.057
was also losing control.

21:08.058 --> 21:10.519
[reporter] Further down the hall,
Lisa Levy was asleep.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.772
She, too, died without regaining
consciousness.

21:15.315 --> 21:18.777
Still further down the hall, roommates
Karen Chandler and Kathy Kleiner

21:18.860 --> 21:20.404
survived their attacks.

21:20.487 --> 21:23.365
Both were asleep,
neither saw their attacker.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.243
[Katsaris] When you walk into a room,

21:26.326 --> 21:29.079
with the intentions of harming someone

21:29.162 --> 21:31.540
but then end up brutalizing

21:31.915 --> 21:33.500
one, two,

21:33.583 --> 21:35.460
three, four--

21:36.253 --> 21:39.381
It shocked even all of us who have seen...

21:39.965 --> 21:41.550
brutalization before.

21:45.512 --> 21:48.724
When he hit the girls,
I just don't think they had a chance

21:48.807 --> 21:49.808
to fight back.

21:50.350 --> 21:51.893
I think he just went in and hit.

21:52.352 --> 21:54.688
I just don't think they had
a chance to cry out.

21:56.064 --> 21:59.109
[Katsaris]
That same night, while I was outside,

21:59.192 --> 22:01.987
we got a call
that crackled on my radio and said,

22:02.070 --> 22:06.533
"There are some real unusual noises
coming from a duplex.

22:06.908 --> 22:10.495
The neighbor next door
is calling in and saying,

22:10.579 --> 22:13.749
'It sounds like somebody
is really being beat up.'"

22:13.832 --> 22:16.335
And I said, "Could it be?

22:17.002 --> 22:22.215
Is it possible? Could the same person
have gone to another location?"

22:23.216 --> 22:26.970
And I said, "No,
in all my studies of criminology,

22:27.054 --> 22:29.639
crime, criminals and their methods,

22:29.723 --> 22:31.933
they do something like this,
they're on the lam.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.894
They're gone.
They don't want to be around.

22:33.977 --> 22:36.021
They're certainly not gonna commit
another crime."

22:36.772 --> 22:39.399
I sent an investigator to that scene.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.693
It was only about six blocks away.

22:41.777 --> 22:46.490
Sure enough, there laid a young lady,
a dance major,

22:47.366 --> 22:49.326
brutalized, beaten,

22:49.659 --> 22:51.286
laying in a pool of blood.

22:52.371 --> 22:55.123
Obviously, we had the same individual

22:55.207 --> 22:59.127
who didn't get but a few blocks
and couldn't stop himself.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.759
He brutalized them.

23:05.842 --> 23:07.386
Two to their death

23:07.469 --> 23:11.556
and three to his certainty
that he had killed them.

23:11.640 --> 23:12.849
But he had not.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.811
[reporter] Florida Department
of Criminal Law Enforcement

23:15.894 --> 23:18.897
crime lab experts
are busy sifting through and analyzing

23:18.980 --> 23:21.358
evidence that was collected
from the Chi Omega house.

23:21.900 --> 23:26.446
We were thinking,
"Who could it be and how did he get there?

23:26.530 --> 23:29.908
And what methods were used and why?"

23:29.991 --> 23:32.494
I mean, the questions were just numerous.

23:33.537 --> 23:35.872
So I made my way to the morgue.

23:36.540 --> 23:41.503
There, as I examined the bodies
of the two deceased girls,

23:41.586 --> 23:45.924
I saw that there was mutilation
by mouth, by teeth.

23:47.008 --> 23:48.969
There was a very large,

23:49.594 --> 23:50.846
very imprinted,

23:51.346 --> 23:53.098
double bite mark.

23:54.808 --> 23:57.561
[male reporter] What kind of a person
do you think is at large?

23:57.644 --> 24:00.272
Well, I'd rather say

24:00.605 --> 24:04.693
we've got a very disturbed,
sick individual.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.532
[birds chirping]

24:14.119 --> 24:17.122
[girl] Everybody's scared all the time.
Even just walking to classes.

24:17.205 --> 24:19.040
And today, we've been keeping
our doors locked

24:19.124 --> 24:21.001
during the day too,
which we don't usually do.

24:24.087 --> 24:27.382
[man] There'd never been a crime
like this before in Tallahassee.

24:27.966 --> 24:30.135
There was a tenseness in the air.

24:30.218 --> 24:32.471
A nagging fear, a nagging question,

24:32.888 --> 24:35.932
that could not be just pushed aside.

24:37.100 --> 24:42.022
I was a 28-year-old journalist
down at WFSU TV in Tallahassee.

24:43.940 --> 24:49.696
Across the street from the TV station
was a Chi Omega sorority house.

24:50.363 --> 24:53.825
We had coeds who were savagely attacked.

24:53.909 --> 24:57.078
And nobody knew
who was responsible for this,

24:57.162 --> 24:58.622
but they were still out there.

24:59.956 --> 25:01.750
[helicopter thrumming]

25:01.833 --> 25:05.212
You'd hear helicopters flying overhead
at night,

25:05.295 --> 25:07.172
buzzing across the city.

25:07.964 --> 25:10.217
[reporter] Police continue to guard
the Chi Omega house

25:10.300 --> 25:12.260
around the clock,
but the girls who live there

25:12.344 --> 25:14.554
haven't slept in the house
since last weekend

25:15.013 --> 25:17.140
and there's no word
on when they'll return.

25:17.224 --> 25:18.725
Everybody wanted answers.

25:18.808 --> 25:20.810
Obviously, we didn't have any answers.

25:21.853 --> 25:25.607
We did call the FBI,
but they were not very helpful.

25:26.900 --> 25:29.945
They started working
on getting together a profile

25:30.028 --> 25:33.073
of the type of person we might
be looking for,

25:33.532 --> 25:37.369
but unfortunately a profile
could apply to so many people.

25:38.286 --> 25:40.747
It's good when you have
the person that did it,

25:40.830 --> 25:43.667
and say, "Aha! See? It matches."

25:43.750 --> 25:47.462
But you couldn't take that profile
and go out and find the person.

25:47.879 --> 25:49.589
It just doesn't work that way.

25:50.215 --> 25:53.176
We are trying to establish
the whereabouts, um,

25:53.260 --> 25:57.722
and if certain people and so on could've
been in the Tallahassee area. Yes.

25:57.806 --> 26:01.226
It's just running down
every lead to the nth degree,

26:01.309 --> 26:03.395
rather than allowing anything to slip by.

26:04.521 --> 26:06.898
[Katsaris]
Every County in Florida was frightened.

26:07.399 --> 26:10.026
Window locks, door locks, padlocks.

26:10.652 --> 26:13.280
I mean, the stores
were selling out of everything,

26:13.655 --> 26:17.951
because people thought, "Goodness,
there's a murderer on the loose."

26:30.672 --> 26:33.675
[man] Lake City was,
you know, small town USA.

26:33.758 --> 26:35.343
Everybody knew everybody.

26:36.011 --> 26:39.806
People didn't lock the front door,
left keys in the car in the driveway.

26:40.348 --> 26:42.142
Kids just walked all over town.

26:43.935 --> 26:46.605
And Kim Leach was just a small-town girl.

26:47.939 --> 26:49.983
[reporter] 12-year-old
Kimberly Diane Leach

26:50.066 --> 26:51.818
went to school Thursday, February 9th,

26:51.901 --> 26:54.029
here at Lake City Junior High School.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.947
By mid-morning, she was missing

26:56.239 --> 26:58.825
and no one has seen or heard
from her since.

26:59.367 --> 27:01.703
[Dekle] First I heard
of the disappearance of Kim Leach,

27:01.786 --> 27:03.371
I was driving to the hospital

27:03.913 --> 27:06.166
to visit my wife
who had just delivered our third child

27:06.249 --> 27:08.585
and I heard about it on the radio.

27:09.586 --> 27:13.465
[male reporter] She exited this building
and walked across this basketball court.

27:13.882 --> 27:16.885
But from then on, the whereabouts
of Kimberly Diane Leach

27:16.968 --> 27:19.721
is unknown to the Lake City
Police Department.

27:20.639 --> 27:21.890
[Dekle] It was a real whodunit.

27:22.557 --> 27:24.893
We had a missing person
to begin with,

27:24.976 --> 27:29.314
but we didn't have Kim Leach's body.
It was a monumental task.

27:30.231 --> 27:32.984
[reporter] A wide search is being made
for Leach in Lake City.

27:33.068 --> 27:35.236
More than 75 state troopers,

27:35.320 --> 27:38.365
Florida Division of Forestry workers,
deputies and others

27:38.448 --> 27:40.241
are helping out in that hunt.

27:57.050 --> 27:59.052
[birds chirping]

28:14.150 --> 28:17.654
[Bundy] That day in Pensacola
had been one of the best I'd spent.

28:18.029 --> 28:20.281
It was sunny, I'd gone to the ocean,
laid on the beach.

28:20.782 --> 28:23.535
And I said to myself--
I remember saying to myself that day,

28:23.618 --> 28:25.537
"Boy, you've got it whipped." You know?

28:25.620 --> 28:27.539
"This is the way to start out 1978,

28:27.622 --> 28:30.041
laying on the beach
in the Gulf of Florida."

28:31.376 --> 28:34.546
And just laying there in the sand
and getting a bit of a tan.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.881
I mean, I was super confident

28:36.965 --> 28:39.050
and I was just-- just feeling

28:39.134 --> 28:42.387
really satisfied with the way things were.

28:53.314 --> 28:55.191
[reporter] Police arrested
this 31-year-old man

28:55.275 --> 28:58.486
after a high speed chase
Wednesday morning in Pensacola, Florida.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.197
He claims to be
a Florida State University law student.

29:01.823 --> 29:05.910
[Katsaris] An officer in Pensacola,
doing his job very well,

29:06.536 --> 29:09.330
stopped a car that, in his gut, said,

29:09.414 --> 29:12.834
"This isn't right, it's going slow."
It just didn't look right.

29:13.501 --> 29:15.003
[reporter] Who is this man?

29:15.086 --> 29:17.839
He was arrested driving
a stolen Tallahassee car,

29:17.922 --> 29:20.508
and carrying 21 stolen credit cards,

29:20.592 --> 29:23.303
many of which belonged to FSU coeds.

29:23.386 --> 29:25.597
He refused to give his name to authorities

29:25.680 --> 29:27.974
and he resisted arrest with violence.

29:28.391 --> 29:31.686
[man] He grabbed my wrist and we had
a struggle for control of my revolver.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.147
After several minutes of fighting,
I did manage to subdue him

29:34.230 --> 29:35.982
by striking him with my revolver

29:36.065 --> 29:39.319
and completing the arrest by placing
the cuff on his other hand

29:39.402 --> 29:40.820
and taking him back to the patrol car.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.407
[Katsaris] For the initial period

29:44.491 --> 29:48.828
that he was being held
in Pensacola County Jail,

29:49.329 --> 29:50.580
he had another name.

29:51.289 --> 29:55.293
[reporter] He told police that he was
29-year-old Kenneth Misner of Tallahassee,

29:55.376 --> 29:57.670
and even had ID cards to prove it.

29:58.713 --> 30:01.257
[Katsaris]
That person heard that he was in jail

30:01.341 --> 30:03.510
and notified us and said,

30:03.760 --> 30:06.387
"Hey, that's not me. I'm here.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.598
I'm not over there. I didn't do this."

30:09.682 --> 30:12.435
[Dekle] Police didn't know
who they had in Pensacola.

30:12.977 --> 30:15.522
He handed over a driver's license,

30:15.605 --> 30:18.274
but, you know,
driver's licenses in 1979 in Florida

30:18.358 --> 30:20.318
were printed on a little piece of paper,

30:20.401 --> 30:23.196
almost like, you know,
you'd put the form into a typewriter

30:23.279 --> 30:24.656
and type it out.

30:24.739 --> 30:26.199
There's no picture on them.

30:26.699 --> 30:29.035
[reporter]
When the real Misner was located at home,

30:29.118 --> 30:30.578
he admitted the IDs were phony.

30:30.995 --> 30:34.249
He was ordered held without bond
by a circuit court judge this morning

30:34.332 --> 30:37.085
after he again refused
to identify himself.

30:37.544 --> 30:39.504
[judge] Are you acquainted with
or are you familiar

30:39.587 --> 30:42.757
with the charges against you
as outlined by the state's attorney?

30:43.758 --> 30:47.637
I would like the court
to, um, list them again.

30:47.720 --> 30:50.431
I don't believe I picked everything up
from the state's attorney.

30:50.515 --> 30:54.727
[judge] This is for possession
of stolen property, an automobile,

30:54.811 --> 30:57.230
possession of a stolen television,

30:57.939 --> 30:59.107
uh...

30:59.190 --> 31:02.527
possession of stolen credit cards
on 21 accounts,

31:03.278 --> 31:07.490
possession of stolen tags,
that is automobile tags,

31:08.032 --> 31:12.787
battery of a police officer
and resisting arrest with violence.

31:13.371 --> 31:15.832
[public defender]
He is entitled to a bond on these cases.

31:15.915 --> 31:17.584
[judge] We can't bail him out if we--

31:17.667 --> 31:20.795
We don't even now who he is,
he won't tell us who he is.

31:22.547 --> 31:24.215
Who would be the principal on the bond?

31:24.299 --> 31:26.009
Your Honor, all I know is what they say.

31:26.092 --> 31:28.219
I don't know
whether he's given his name or not.

31:28.303 --> 31:31.055
He's certainly entitled to a bond
in any event I would think.

31:31.139 --> 31:33.683
[prosecutor] Your Honor,
the public defender heard the man admit

31:33.766 --> 31:36.060
that he is not the person
whose name he gave

31:36.144 --> 31:38.563
and he has failed to come forward
with his correct name.

31:39.856 --> 31:44.944
[judge] Well, until we find out who he is,
there's no way we can bail him out.

31:45.028 --> 31:46.279
[public defender] All right.

31:46.821 --> 31:49.115
[reporter]
The mystery man will be kept behind bars

31:49.198 --> 31:51.117
before returning to court to enter a plea.

31:51.409 --> 31:54.537
Officials say by then,
they hope to know who he is.

31:55.705 --> 31:58.541
[Katsaris] We have an individual,
we don't know who he is yet.

31:59.167 --> 32:02.921
So it became
an information-gathering process,

32:03.296 --> 32:05.840
and we focused on the car.

32:07.508 --> 32:09.677
There was no hair fibers.

32:10.011 --> 32:13.431
There were no trace evidence of any kind.

32:15.058 --> 32:18.311
But we did identify
that it was a stolen vehicle,

32:18.853 --> 32:20.772
stolen from nearby...

32:21.481 --> 32:22.565
the Chi Omega house.

32:23.232 --> 32:26.861
I thought, you know,
this might be our first potential suspect.

32:27.320 --> 32:29.948
So I sent investigators to Pensacola

32:30.031 --> 32:32.408
and we started to learn more about him.

32:33.117 --> 32:35.745
[male reporter] Two people
who want most to know who he is

32:35.828 --> 32:38.957
are Tallahassee detectives
Steve Bodiford and Don Pachen.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.834
They have now spent several hours
quizzing Mr. Mystery

32:41.918 --> 32:45.380
about the slayings last month
of two Florida State University coeds

32:45.463 --> 32:46.464
from St. Petersburg.

32:47.507 --> 32:50.468
[Katsaris] We started investigating
and talking to him,

32:50.551 --> 32:53.972
asked him if he would talk to us,
and he was reluctant.

32:54.430 --> 32:55.890
He started playing games.

32:56.265 --> 32:59.644
He's a very careful thinker,
and from what I understand, he--

32:59.727 --> 33:02.981
from the men who've been questioning him--
he says what, uh...

33:03.064 --> 33:06.150
what he wants to, and he's very careful
about how he says it.

33:06.818 --> 33:10.279
[Katsaris] For a while, I let him
play his games with my investigators

33:10.363 --> 33:12.240
until I said, "Enough."

33:12.782 --> 33:14.826
And then it started unraveling.

33:16.411 --> 33:19.998
[Bundy] I was being interrogated
by the police in Pensacola.

33:20.540 --> 33:24.085
And I have no way of measuring...

33:25.128 --> 33:29.090
on a scale of one to ten,
or one to a hundred even what--

33:29.173 --> 33:33.219
what the traumatic effect
on my mind and body was.

33:33.970 --> 33:35.722
And I said I wanted to talk to somebody.

33:35.805 --> 33:37.557
Just someone to talk to--

33:37.640 --> 33:39.851
I needed a friend,
I needed somebody close.

33:39.934 --> 33:42.937
I didn't want a cop or an attorney.
I was sick and tired of cops.

33:43.438 --> 33:45.940
I needed somebody there.
Somebody to talk to.

33:46.399 --> 33:47.859
Somebody to settle me down

33:47.942 --> 33:50.445
and to help me get over this...

33:51.195 --> 33:54.073
reaction I was having
being back in custody.

33:54.699 --> 33:56.993
He finally identified himself

33:57.076 --> 34:00.621
in exchange for a phone call
to his girlfriend Liz.

34:03.291 --> 34:08.337
[male investigator] The date is 2/21/78.
The time is 15:20 hours.

34:08.796 --> 34:11.883
This will be an interview
with Elizabeth Kloepfer.

34:12.675 --> 34:15.845
Could you begin on February 16th, '78

34:15.928 --> 34:19.599
and describe the telephone call
that you received from Ted Bundy?

34:19.682 --> 34:22.727
[woman] Uh, he called collect,
my daughter accepted the charges.

34:22.810 --> 34:26.773
And he said that he was in custody
and I asked him where and he said Florida.

34:27.231 --> 34:28.733
He repeated over and over again

34:28.816 --> 34:30.818
that this was really going to be bad
when it broke.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.820
That it was not going
to break until tomorrow morning

34:32.904 --> 34:35.656
and be in the press,
but it was going to be really ugly.

34:35.740 --> 34:37.366
And I asked him...

34:37.867 --> 34:40.787
if he was referring to the murders
of some sorority girls in Florida,

34:40.870 --> 34:43.998
and he said
that he wouldn't talk about it.

34:44.874 --> 34:48.211
He told me that he wished that we could
sit down and talk about...

34:48.961 --> 34:50.838
things without anyone listening.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.758
About why he was the way he is,
and I said,

34:53.841 --> 34:55.927
"Are you telling me that you're sick?"

34:56.010 --> 35:00.723
And he said-- He was really defensive
and he told me to back off.

35:01.516 --> 35:04.685
Saturday morning at two,
he called again... collect.

35:05.520 --> 35:09.482
And he said that he wanted to talk
about what we'd been talking about.

35:10.441 --> 35:12.652
He told me that he was sick
and that he...

35:13.778 --> 35:16.656
was consumed by something
that he didn't understand

35:16.739 --> 35:18.741
and that, um...

35:19.659 --> 35:20.576
that it--

35:21.619 --> 35:23.329
that he just couldn't contain it.

35:23.704 --> 35:28.793
He spent so much time trying to maintain
a normal life and he just couldn't do it.

35:28.876 --> 35:31.546
He said that he was preoccupied
with this force.

35:33.756 --> 35:37.635
[Michaud] Ted was identified,
and at that point, the jig's up, right?

35:38.594 --> 35:40.638
[reporter]
The police in Pensacola, Florida,

35:40.721 --> 35:43.891
stopped a man driving a stolen car
and found to their surprise,

35:43.975 --> 35:46.769
and perhaps pleasure,
it was Theodore Robert Bundy,

35:46.853 --> 35:50.148
one of the ten most wanted criminals
in this country.

35:50.231 --> 35:54.944
[Michaud] It was remarkable that Ted
was able to elude the police for so long.

35:55.278 --> 35:58.114
But Ted had that sort
of chameleon-like face

35:58.197 --> 36:02.243
that could look 100 different ways,
depending on the angle that you caught it.

36:02.326 --> 36:07.707
He was handsome and smooth-talking.
That allowed him to do what he did.

36:08.457 --> 36:12.461
And Ted told me
that after he escaped Colorado,

36:12.545 --> 36:13.880
he got himself on a bus,

36:15.089 --> 36:17.592
took the bus to Denver.

36:19.177 --> 36:22.513
At Denver, he got a flight to Chicago.

36:24.182 --> 36:27.894
In Chicago he got on an Amtrak train
and went to Ann Arbor,

36:28.853 --> 36:33.691
and was there to watch his alma mater,
the University of Washington,

36:33.774 --> 36:36.194
play the University of Michigan
in the Rose Bowl.

36:40.114 --> 36:42.325
He got drunk watching it in a college bar

36:42.825 --> 36:45.536
and almost got himself beat to shit
by a bunch of Michigan fans.

36:46.329 --> 36:49.248
Spent the night in the sanctuary
of a Methodist church,

36:49.916 --> 36:51.584
stole a car the next day,

36:52.501 --> 36:54.212
and got as far as...

36:54.837 --> 36:57.006
Atlanta, where he abandons it.

36:58.674 --> 37:01.344
He then takes a bus to...

37:01.427 --> 37:04.388
Tallahassee and Florida State University.

37:08.351 --> 37:10.144
[man]
Well, why Florida in the first place?

37:10.228 --> 37:14.482
[Bundy] It was the very opposite end
of the country from the Pacific Northwest.

37:15.316 --> 37:16.901
Not that I disliked the northern climate,

37:16.984 --> 37:19.403
but I didn't have the clothing
and it was...

37:19.487 --> 37:21.322
It'd just be harder to get around

37:21.697 --> 37:25.034
and to live in a cold climate
when you didn't have any money.

37:25.576 --> 37:29.121
I didn't know anybody in Florida,
and I thought the likelihood

37:29.205 --> 37:33.042
that Florida would know anything
about Ted Bundy was remote.

37:33.834 --> 37:37.755
[McChesney] The fact that Ted
was able to escape and get into Florida

37:37.838 --> 37:39.882
through a circuitous route

37:40.466 --> 37:44.053
sounds crazy, but back in the late '70s,

37:44.136 --> 37:46.764
we didn't have the technology
that we have now.

37:48.808 --> 37:51.686
[Michaud] The authorities,
including the FBI,

37:51.769 --> 37:54.605
had a very limited number of tools.

37:57.316 --> 38:01.988
No DNA, you know, no teletypes--
They didn't even have fax machines.

38:05.116 --> 38:08.160
You know, imagine a world
where most of the communication

38:08.244 --> 38:11.872
is done by US mail or rotary telephones.

38:12.873 --> 38:17.169
And so they were always
at least a step behind Ted.

38:17.712 --> 38:21.257
And he believed,
"I can't get caught doing this."

38:23.342 --> 38:25.970
[Katsaris]
After all the grief that he created,

38:26.762 --> 38:28.514
it was a traffic stop!

38:29.974 --> 38:33.352
A traffic stop that we got him on.

38:33.436 --> 38:36.897
[male reporter] Authorities say they can
place Bundy in Tallahassee in January

38:36.981 --> 38:41.402
and he has become a prime suspect
in the Chi Omega sorority house murders.

38:51.787 --> 38:53.789
[indistinct clamoring]

39:01.505 --> 39:04.550
[Keppel] I believe Kathy McChesney
read it in the newspaper

39:04.633 --> 39:09.055
that Bundy had been arrested in Florida.

39:09.138 --> 39:11.390
So we were pleased to know it.

39:11.474 --> 39:13.809
We weren't pleased
that somebody was murdered, but...

39:14.643 --> 39:16.145
certainly it was, uh...

39:16.937 --> 39:17.897
a good start.

39:19.106 --> 39:21.650
[McChesney]
Ted was a absolutely prime suspect

39:21.734 --> 39:22.943
for the Chi Omega,

39:23.361 --> 39:29.158
and he was placed just,
you know, within miles...

39:29.241 --> 39:31.744
of where the offenses occurred.

39:32.828 --> 39:35.373
[reporter] Many of the 21 credit cards
Bundy had with him

39:35.456 --> 39:36.832
were stolen in Sherrod's,

39:37.291 --> 39:40.669
a bar next to the Chi Omega sorority,
on Jefferson Avenue.

39:40.753 --> 39:43.297
[reporter #2] Bundy lived in this house,
which is four blocks

39:43.381 --> 39:44.965
from the Chi Omega sorority.

39:45.049 --> 39:48.094
He was there for several weeks
before and after the killings.

39:48.928 --> 39:51.639
Frances Messier lived
across the hall from Bundy

39:51.722 --> 39:53.307
and knew him as Chris.

39:53.391 --> 39:54.850
What kind of person was he?

39:55.559 --> 39:57.812
Um, a quiet-type person.

39:59.647 --> 40:02.024
Aloof and friendly.

40:02.108 --> 40:04.068
You'd gone out to dinner
with him one time?

40:04.527 --> 40:06.070
We went out to dinner once.

40:07.154 --> 40:09.365
Yes, that, that's kinda... [chuckles]

40:13.536 --> 40:16.163
[Dekle]
At this point, Bundy was also a suspect

40:16.664 --> 40:19.417
as the potential killer of Kim Leach.

40:19.959 --> 40:22.253
We tracked a number
of stolen credit cards

40:22.336 --> 40:24.130
that we found in his possession

40:24.755 --> 40:28.259
and found that he had spent the night
at the Lake City Holiday Inn

40:28.634 --> 40:30.636
two and a half miles from...

40:30.719 --> 40:34.265
the Lake City Junior High School
the night before Kim went missing.

40:34.640 --> 40:38.102
Uh, that's a pretty good indication
you might want to look at him

40:38.185 --> 40:39.478
as a possible suspect.

40:40.104 --> 40:42.773
[male reporter] Bundy allegedly
spent the evening after he checked in

40:42.857 --> 40:44.483
sitting in the motel's bar,

40:44.567 --> 40:48.279
sipping gin while chatting with a man
next to him for several hours.

40:48.779 --> 40:50.948
Bundy checked out
of the Lake City Holiday Inn

40:51.031 --> 40:53.117
the next morning at about 7:30,

40:53.200 --> 40:55.786
the same morning
Kimberly Leach disappeared.

40:56.370 --> 40:59.165
But before we could make
any kind of a homicide case,

40:59.248 --> 41:00.458
we had to find the body.

41:01.625 --> 41:04.462
And some time
about a month and a half later,

41:04.545 --> 41:06.755
we had found what we were looking for.

41:08.007 --> 41:10.009
[reporter]
Eight weeks of searching led to her body.

41:10.092 --> 41:13.179
in a deserted tin shack,
next to an empty hog pen.

41:15.848 --> 41:17.892
[Dekle] Worst thing in the world
a prosecutor can do

41:17.975 --> 41:19.768
is get personally involved in a case.

41:21.395 --> 41:24.190
And, uh... I had not cried

41:24.565 --> 41:26.192
in my entire adult life.

41:26.275 --> 41:28.652
I hadn't cried since I was a teenager.

41:29.570 --> 41:32.406
I cried the day we found Kim Leach's body.

41:37.536 --> 41:40.372
She was just a... smart, intelligent,

41:40.706 --> 41:41.707
obedient,

41:42.374 --> 41:44.168
little girl who, uh...

41:44.877 --> 41:46.337
reminded me of my daughter.

41:48.130 --> 41:50.341
[woman] To actually have
a 12-year-old child

41:50.424 --> 41:51.967
taken from our community

41:52.551 --> 41:54.011
and brutally murdered

41:54.094 --> 41:56.013
by some monster--

41:56.096 --> 41:59.016
Just grabbed her up and took her away--

41:59.266 --> 42:01.727
It's just shock and disbelief.

42:08.776 --> 42:10.236
[Katsaris] I told Ted Bundy,

42:10.319 --> 42:14.323
we now have the evidence
to charge him with both cases.

42:16.283 --> 42:21.997
He looked at me and said,
"When you find the person...

42:22.873 --> 42:27.336
that committed these crimes
that you think I committed...

42:28.462 --> 42:29.755
that person...

42:30.339 --> 42:33.801
is going to be wanted for...

42:34.927 --> 42:36.762
murders of women

42:37.596 --> 42:39.390
in the three digits...

42:41.517 --> 42:42.393
and...

42:43.727 --> 42:45.062
six states."

42:46.772 --> 42:48.774
And he put his fingers up like that.

42:52.528 --> 42:54.822
[Dekle] Ted Bundy was one mad-dog killer

42:55.072 --> 42:56.782
and I wanted him executed,

42:56.865 --> 42:59.994
but he had not been indicted
in either case.

43:01.245 --> 43:05.708
So I spent a good deal of time
in Tallahassee conferring with the, uh,

43:05.791 --> 43:08.711
prosecutors in Tallahassee
about the Tallahassee case.

43:09.086 --> 43:11.213
Which case should be tried first.

43:12.256 --> 43:13.632
I felt that, uh,

43:13.716 --> 43:16.677
Bundy ought to be tried
in Tallahassee first,

43:17.011 --> 43:20.097
because they had a much more secure jail
in Tallahassee.

43:22.349 --> 43:25.227
[Katsaris] My goal was to never...

43:25.686 --> 43:29.315
ever allow him to kill another young lady.

43:30.441 --> 43:33.986
So we put him
into a secure portion of the jail.

43:34.945 --> 43:37.364
And then we had three locks on the door:

43:37.531 --> 43:41.619
the traditional key lock,
the big key, the jail key,

43:41.702 --> 43:45.289
and then two very large, uh...

43:45.372 --> 43:47.958
very, very strong padlocks.

43:51.545 --> 43:53.922
One night, I did something unusual.

43:54.548 --> 43:58.427
And I went to his cell and I said,
"Ted you're coming with me."

43:58.802 --> 44:01.889
And he said, "This is a change-up.
This is different."

44:03.182 --> 44:04.850
I said, "We're going for a ride."

44:05.142 --> 44:07.394
And that didn't go over real well.

44:08.103 --> 44:10.356
I believe he thought I was going
to take him for a ride

44:10.439 --> 44:12.358
from which he would never return,

44:12.900 --> 44:14.693
that I was going to exercise

44:15.027 --> 44:18.405
some kind of authority as the sheriff
to do him in.

44:20.324 --> 44:22.993
We transported him with a series of cars

44:23.494 --> 44:28.248
and as we opened the back door
to go up the stairway, the back entrance,

44:29.416 --> 44:32.920
doors swung open,
and there stood these three doctors

44:33.003 --> 44:36.757
their white smocks on,
and behind them was a dental chair.

44:37.091 --> 44:39.176
And he lost it.

44:41.011 --> 44:43.555
He didn't know that what I had

44:43.639 --> 44:46.266
was a bite mark from the crime scene,

44:46.350 --> 44:50.521
which, I believed at the time,
was Ted Bundy's signature,

44:50.938 --> 44:54.483
and we wanted to search
any and all parts of his mouth

44:54.566 --> 44:55.943
including his teeth.

44:57.486 --> 44:58.904
Well, he started screaming,

44:58.987 --> 45:01.198
"You can't do this without my attorney."

45:01.281 --> 45:03.158
I said, "Oh, yes, we can.

45:04.118 --> 45:07.788
Ted, we have a warrant
and we're serving it on you."

45:08.372 --> 45:12.459
We showed him the devices
that we could use as a degree of force.

45:13.836 --> 45:19.425
Then on a dime, his mindset changed
like it was a different person.

45:21.260 --> 45:22.594
He looked at me...

45:23.721 --> 45:24.972
he turned around...

45:25.764 --> 45:27.599
he sat in the dental chair...

45:28.100 --> 45:29.435
he leaned back...

45:30.144 --> 45:31.395
put a smile on

45:31.854 --> 45:32.855
and said,

45:33.480 --> 45:34.398
"Ken,

45:35.274 --> 45:37.359
you know you don't need all that stuff.

45:37.776 --> 45:39.737
I'm not a violent person."

45:40.279 --> 45:41.488
He opened his mouth.

45:42.072 --> 45:43.782
He said, "Do what you have to do."

45:53.876 --> 45:58.172
[Hula] Everybody realized
that there was somebody very special

45:58.255 --> 46:01.800
being held by the police in Tallahassee.

46:02.301 --> 46:05.971
The dots began to connect
from all across the country.

46:06.346 --> 46:10.934
From Washington State to Utah,
through the Rockies to Florida.

46:11.018 --> 46:16.023
We became a focal point
of criminal justice inquiries

46:16.106 --> 46:17.524
in the weeks that followed.

46:18.233 --> 46:20.819
[Katsaris]
Other investigators came to the jail

46:21.236 --> 46:25.449
to try to interview him for other cases
they were working on,

46:25.532 --> 46:27.075
for which they didn't have evidence.

46:27.159 --> 46:29.661
That had to wait, because we had evidence

46:29.745 --> 46:31.997
and we had Ted Bundy in our custody,

46:32.498 --> 46:35.876
something the other investigators
never had the luxury of.

46:35.959 --> 46:40.839
So I wasn't going to divert
from the path we set. Period.

46:42.341 --> 46:44.968
And I will tell you
I had a personal vengeance

46:45.052 --> 46:47.095
for the person that did this.

46:55.354 --> 46:57.397
I wanted to be the one to tell him

46:57.481 --> 47:00.275
that the grand jurors of this county

47:00.359 --> 47:02.069
have indicted you for murder.

47:06.198 --> 47:09.076
[Bundy] Gentlemen, I'm not gonna
be paraded for Ken Katsaris' benefit.

47:09.159 --> 47:10.494
Step out, Mr. Bundy.

47:15.541 --> 47:17.292
[Bundy]
What do we have here, Ken? Let's see.

47:17.376 --> 47:20.838
Oh, it's an indictment? All right.
Why don't you read it to me?

47:20.921 --> 47:22.548
You're about up for election,
aren't you?

47:23.048 --> 47:25.342
-This is how you got it, didn't you?
-Mr. Bundy--

47:25.425 --> 47:27.469
You told me,
that you were going to get me.

47:27.553 --> 47:30.305
He said he was going to get me, okay?
You got me indicted.

47:30.389 --> 47:33.392
It's all you're going to get.
Just read it. Let's go.

47:34.184 --> 47:35.853
Theodore Robert Bundy,

47:35.936 --> 47:39.481
you are charged, indictment,
two counts of burglary,

47:39.565 --> 47:42.401
and, uh,
two counts murder in the first degree,

47:42.734 --> 47:46.196
three counts
attempted murder in the first degree.

47:46.530 --> 47:49.074
In the name of, and by the authority
of the State of Florida,

47:49.157 --> 47:52.244
the grand jurors of the State of Florida
and panel that's sworn to inquire

47:52.327 --> 47:54.663
and true presentment make.
And therefore the County of Leon

47:54.746 --> 47:57.416
upon their oath do present
that Theodore Robert Bundy,

47:57.499 --> 48:00.168
on the 15th day of January 1978,

48:00.252 --> 48:03.589
in Leon County, Florida, did then there
unlawfully kill a human being

48:03.672 --> 48:06.466
to wit: Margaret Bowman,
by strangling and/or beating her,

48:06.550 --> 48:09.511
and said killing was perpetrated
by said Theodore Robert Bundy,

48:09.595 --> 48:11.346
from or with a premeditated design

48:11.430 --> 48:13.515
or attempt to affect the death
of said Margaret Bowman,

48:13.974 --> 48:16.518
contrary to Section 810-02
Florida Statutes.

48:16.602 --> 48:18.520
-Very good.
-And your grand jurors being present

48:18.604 --> 48:20.898
further give the court
to be informed and understand...

48:20.981 --> 48:26.028
[Hula] It wasn't a press conference.
It was a staged perp walk

48:26.111 --> 48:28.071
by Sheriff Ken Katsaris.

48:28.530 --> 48:34.328
to make a big deal out of him
arresting and charging Theodore Bundy.

48:35.245 --> 48:39.041
Katsaris in his black suit,
and his cowboy boots on.

48:39.499 --> 48:42.586
It was part political theater,
part crime drama.

48:43.086 --> 48:45.923
Said killing was perpetrated
by said Theodore Robert Bundy

48:46.006 --> 48:50.636
from or with a premeditated design
or attempt to affect the death

48:50.719 --> 48:53.597
-of said Lisa Levy...
-My chance to talk to the press.

48:53.680 --> 48:56.600
...contrary to section 780-204
Florida statutes.

48:56.683 --> 48:58.185
I'll plead not guilty right now.

48:58.268 --> 49:01.146
And your grand jurors being present
in said court further gives the court

49:01.229 --> 49:03.023
to be informed and understand
that Theodore Bundy

49:03.106 --> 49:06.318
-on the 15th day of January--
-Can I talk to the press when you're done?

49:06.401 --> 49:09.571
did then and there unlawfully attempt
to kill a human being to wit...

49:09.655 --> 49:13.075
[Bundy] It ceased to be an issue
whether or not I was innocent or guilty.

49:13.575 --> 49:15.786
The issue now is, "Can we pin it on him?"

49:15.869 --> 49:19.831
[stuttering] Can we follow through
and maintain our reputation

49:19.915 --> 49:21.583
as law enforcement officers?

49:22.793 --> 49:27.089
The police aren't willing to accept
what I think they know,

49:27.172 --> 49:29.383
and they know that I didn't do
these things.

49:29.758 --> 49:32.386
That is the indictment handed down
by the grand jury.

49:32.970 --> 49:35.138
-Is that my copy?
-No, it is not.

49:35.222 --> 49:37.891
-Do I get a copy?
-We have your copy. You have the copy?

49:37.975 --> 49:39.017
Can I have a copy?

49:39.768 --> 49:40.811
How about the case?

49:41.436 --> 49:43.397
-You get that.
-Can I talk to the press?

49:43.480 --> 49:44.690
I mean, you had your chance.

49:45.023 --> 49:48.318
You've displayed the prisoner,
now I think it's my turn.

49:49.695 --> 49:52.072
I've been kept in isolation
for six months,

49:52.155 --> 49:54.992
I've been kept away from the press,
I've been buried by you,

49:55.075 --> 49:58.370
you've been talking for six months,
I think it's my turn now.

49:58.912 --> 49:59.871
All right?

50:00.330 --> 50:02.749
We got a court order that there won't
be any press interviews.

50:02.833 --> 50:05.210
Sure there won't be any press interviews.
You've given them up.

50:05.293 --> 50:06.920
I-- I'm gagged, you're not.

50:07.004 --> 50:07.921
All right.

50:08.005 --> 50:09.047
I'll be heard.
