WEBVTT

00:48.048 --> 00:51.552
All right, one last card...
9 of clubs.

00:53.762 --> 00:58.762
Uh... I'm all in, 80 bucks.

01:04.690 --> 01:06.567
I fold.

01:09.361 --> 01:12.071
You're a shit liar, Tod.

01:12.072 --> 01:12.572
Am I?

01:17.369 --> 01:19.370
You got something,
but it's not much.

01:19.371 --> 01:20.871
Just play the hand!

01:20.872 --> 01:23.082
80?

01:23.083 --> 01:23.627
Call it.

01:27.546 --> 01:31.966
I got uh... kings with a deuce.

01:31.967 --> 01:33.469
Kings, 10 kicker.

01:36.013 --> 01:37.013
Time to say goodnight!

01:37.014 --> 01:39.140
No, no, no... I'm not leaving.

01:39.141 --> 01:40.057
Bullshit!

01:40.058 --> 01:40.900
You don't have any money.

01:40.901 --> 01:42.314
So somebody give me a loan!

01:42.315 --> 01:43.561
Fuck you!

01:43.562 --> 01:44.939
What do you mean fuck you?

01:44.940 --> 01:47.231
Gimme... gimme a loan!

01:47.232 --> 01:49.108
I'm good for it.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.401
Time to go home, Tod.

01:50.402 --> 01:51.745
Just give me a fucking
break, just give me...

01:51.746 --> 01:52.653
just give me a loan.

01:52.654 --> 01:53.826
Hey, don't embarrass yourself.

01:53.827 --> 01:56.200
Get the fuck out of
my fucking face!

01:56.201 --> 01:58.534
I don't care how big you are.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.162
This from the war hero.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.144
Oh fuck...

02:51.588 --> 02:52.213
You little shit,

02:52.214 --> 02:54.683
I know it's you Pidge!

02:57.260 --> 02:59.183
Bastard!

04:50.081 --> 04:52.291
Thank you, Laura.

04:52.292 --> 04:56.212
Tod, hey... have
you seen Pidge?

04:56.213 --> 04:57.051
Isn't he in school?

04:57.052 --> 04:58.214
I know, he ran off.

04:58.215 --> 04:59.637
He refuses to go and
the principal said

04:59.638 --> 05:02.305
one more absent and she's
gonna suspend him.

05:02.306 --> 05:03.224
Does he know that?

05:03.225 --> 05:06.055
Of course.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.140
I... I'll find him.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.310
I love him but he is
driving me crazy and...

05:11.311 --> 05:14.188
you're the only one
that he listens to.

05:14.189 --> 05:17.525
Yeah... no, I'll
keep an eye out.

05:17.526 --> 05:19.652
Thank you.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.319
Ellen?

05:20.320 --> 05:22.196
Yeah?

05:22.197 --> 05:26.075
You look really
good, by the way...

05:26.076 --> 05:28.499
Bye Tod.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.843
Hey Dad.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.303
You find Pidge?

05:46.304 --> 05:48.556
I refuse to spend my
day looking for him,

05:48.557 --> 05:50.104
it's exactly what he wants.

05:50.105 --> 05:51.308
Sounds familiar.

05:51.309 --> 05:52.731
He'll come home
when he's hungry.

05:52.732 --> 05:57.483
Uh Ellen, I... I found those.

05:59.526 --> 06:02.450
Dad, don't start.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.332
I like Tod.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.585
Uh huh, and what about Mike?

06:17.586 --> 06:18.752
Well...

06:18.753 --> 06:21.171
Exactly, no comment.

06:21.172 --> 06:24.049
Look, I know it's a
difficult situation.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.468
Dad, it's just...
it's too soon.

06:26.469 --> 06:29.221
Geez, it's been five years!

06:29.222 --> 06:31.599
You know we... I mean,
we make better friends.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.226
Well, it's gotta
start somewhere.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.730
Mmm hmm... just like it
did with you and Mom?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.984
Look, your mother and I is
a far different situation.

06:39.985 --> 06:43.319
Well, hey... I learn
from example.

06:43.320 --> 06:46.164
Ellen I live here, I
see what's going on...

06:46.165 --> 06:48.073
Pidge needs a father figure.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.202
And that's exactly
why he has you, Dad.

06:50.203 --> 06:53.045
Oh come on Ellen, be reasonable.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.977
Hey, how about a little privacy?

07:54.975 --> 07:57.819
Clean it up.

08:32.178 --> 08:32.765
Tod, Tod!

08:32.767 --> 08:33.636
We're being invaded!

08:33.638 --> 08:34.972
Pidge, where were you?

08:34.972 --> 08:36.313
Your Mom's been looking
all over for you!

08:36.315 --> 08:38.183
There was a military helicopter
ﬂying over the woods!

08:38.183 --> 08:39.652
How far do you think
you're gonna get in life

08:39.653 --> 08:41.020
just screwing around all day?

08:41.020 --> 08:42.229
Huh?

08:42.230 --> 08:43.400
I don't know... there's
guys in the woods!

08:43.400 --> 08:44.365
Did you hear what I said?

08:44.366 --> 08:46.442
Stop joking around!

08:46.443 --> 08:47.865
You know, the school
doesn't want you back,

08:47.866 --> 08:49.579
you got your Mom
worried about you,

08:49.580 --> 08:52.364
you don't do as you're told...

08:52.365 --> 08:53.457
what do you think
your Dad would say

08:53.458 --> 08:55.659
if he was with us still?

08:55.660 --> 08:56.952
Well, I...

08:56.953 --> 08:59.081
The stories are
getting old, Pidge!

08:59.082 --> 09:01.331
Stop.

09:01.332 --> 09:06.170
Come on...

09:06.171 --> 09:07.004
But...

09:07.005 --> 09:10.305
Just, go home.

09:11.426 --> 09:16.513
What are they doing here?

09:16.514 --> 09:20.144
Go... go home.

09:22.437 --> 09:23.854
Hey, can I help you?

09:23.855 --> 09:25.983
Is there a place we
can talk, Deputy?

09:25.984 --> 09:28.656
Who's asking?

09:30.236 --> 09:32.785
Where's your supervisor?

09:49.756 --> 09:50.550
Sheriff Grant,

09:50.551 --> 09:52.594
this is Agent Carney
with the Secret Service.

09:52.595 --> 09:53.263
How you doing?

09:53.264 --> 09:54.051
Good.

09:54.052 --> 09:55.344
Nice to see you.

09:55.345 --> 09:58.267
So, what have we got, the
president coming through?

09:58.268 --> 10:00.479
I'm not at liberty
to say, but yes.

10:00.480 --> 10:01.892
No shit, the president?

10:01.893 --> 10:04.237
<i>Well as it turns out you have
a world class hunting lodge,</i>

10:04.238 --> 10:05.604
up in Wilton Mountain.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.403
The president requested
some R and R and lucky,

10:07.404 --> 10:10.734
or unlucky for you, your
town seems to be on route.

10:10.735 --> 10:11.610
He'd like to have a bit to eat,

10:11.611 --> 10:14.446
maybe take advantage
of a publicity op.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.742
Right here in Suddenly?

10:15.743 --> 10:17.035
I know it's a big hassle.

10:17.036 --> 10:18.534
Hey, no problem at all!

10:18.535 --> 10:19.707
Anything we can do to help.

10:19.708 --> 10:22.296
Fantastic.

10:31.047 --> 10:34.176
So far so good, it's just like
the prelim team laid it out...

10:34.177 --> 10:37.511
everything's going to
plan like clockwork.

10:37.512 --> 10:40.265
Teller's been good.

10:42.100 --> 10:45.269
Everything's gonna
go smooth, right?

10:45.270 --> 10:47.062
Hey... did you hear me?

10:47.063 --> 10:48.689
Everything's gonna
be all right, right?

10:48.690 --> 10:51.569
Everything will be fine.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.872
Probably our ground
wire hang on!

11:01.873 --> 11:03.666
Dad, just... would you call Judd

11:03.667 --> 11:05.006
before you electrocute yourself?

11:05.007 --> 11:08.375
It's a very easy job,
it's just a matter of

11:08.376 --> 11:09.218
white, white...

11:09.219 --> 11:11.170
Geez!

11:11.171 --> 11:12.171
Okay, that's it!

11:12.172 --> 11:13.630
I am calling him.

11:13.631 --> 11:17.926
Ellen, come on...
I can fix this.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.021
Dad, you knocked the power out.

11:20.022 --> 11:22.764
Don't touch that!

11:22.765 --> 11:24.016
Mom... Mom, guess what?

11:24.017 --> 11:24.850
Pidge!

11:24.851 --> 11:25.689
Where have you been?

11:25.690 --> 11:26.560
What have I told you?

11:26.561 --> 11:27.653
There's Secret
Service everywhere,

11:27.654 --> 11:28.988
the president's coming to town.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.356
You are supposed
to be in school.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.700
Did you hear what I just said?

11:32.701 --> 11:34.651
Judd, hi it's... it's Ellen.

11:34.652 --> 11:35.869
Just a second, I'm on the phone.

11:35.870 --> 11:38.240
I swear, the president's
coming to Suddenly.

11:38.241 --> 11:39.828
Judd sorry, I couldn't hear you.

11:39.829 --> 11:40.949
Yeah, isn't that crazy?

11:40.950 --> 11:42.701
The president's coming.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.080
Look uh, Judd... Dad
is playing handyman,

11:45.081 --> 11:47.289
could you come over?

11:47.290 --> 11:48.582
Great.

11:48.583 --> 11:51.382
Yeah, told you.

11:53.004 --> 11:56.215
You're still in trouble, Mister!

11:56.216 --> 11:58.560
Let's see here... One,
two, three, four, five...

12:03.681 --> 12:04.648
I'm sorry for the short notice
but for security everything

12:04.649 --> 12:07.559
has to run the 11th hour.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.982
How many men do you
have on, Sheriff?

12:08.983 --> 12:11.775
I got Deputy Reid and two
others, but they're off today.

12:11.776 --> 12:14.367
<i>Well get them on, state police
have five cars on the road</i>

12:15.860 --> 12:18.325
they'll control the highway
and the main roads.

12:18.326 --> 12:20.160
Lancer will arrive at
approximately 19:30,

12:20.161 --> 12:22.577
we're gonna park him
over in that vacant lot.

12:22.578 --> 12:24.952
I got accounted snipers in
the surrounding buildings...

12:24.953 --> 12:28.914
strictly no one in this zone
from here on, understood?

12:28.915 --> 12:29.623
Gotcha.

12:29.624 --> 12:32.924
Good, we'll start with the
stores facing the street.

12:32.925 --> 12:36.630
I want them closed and
locked down by 17:00,

12:36.631 --> 12:40.300
all houses around the
vacant lot locked down.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.177
Me and my people will
take the residences,

12:42.178 --> 12:44.476
you and your team
take the businesses.

12:44.477 --> 12:47.516
Did you consult with
the mayor about this?

12:47.517 --> 12:50.102
I don't do that.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.571
All right, well I'll
leave you with Tod.

12:51.572 --> 12:53.280
He'll take you on the tour.

12:53.281 --> 12:55.774
I appreciate your cooperation.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.322
Enjoy the weather, fellas.

12:57.323 --> 12:58.193
Thank you.

12:58.194 --> 13:01.118
Thanks Tod.

13:02.699 --> 13:03.824
Who lives up there?

13:03.825 --> 13:06.451
Pete Howard and his daughter.

13:06.452 --> 13:09.501
It's quite the view.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.048
Excuse me.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.337
Hey.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.636
You have a way with timing...
where are you calling from?

13:19.637 --> 13:20.590
Uh, from home.

13:20.591 --> 13:22.637
The power's out and
it's just a long story

13:22.638 --> 13:24.681
and my battery might
die, so if I lose you...

13:24.682 --> 13:26.807
I won't think that
you hung up on me.

13:26.808 --> 13:29.808
Look, Tod... I, I am
calling for a reason.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.903
Have you heard this thing
about the president?

13:31.904 --> 13:34.604
Yeah, but don't get too excited.

13:34.605 --> 13:37.691
So it's... it's true, I mean...

13:37.692 --> 13:40.027
you think we could meet him?

13:40.028 --> 13:42.907
I can't talk now... um,
there's probably gonna be

13:42.908 --> 13:47.451
some Secret Service guys coming
up to check out your house.

13:47.452 --> 13:48.827
What? When?

13:48.828 --> 13:50.370
I don't know, soon.

13:50.371 --> 13:53.081
And try to keep Pidge
out of trouble.

13:53.082 --> 13:55.250
Yeah, I'll try.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.710
Uh... 'kay, bye.

13:56.711 --> 13:59.214
Bye.

14:16.981 --> 14:17.814
Got it?

14:17.815 --> 14:19.783
Yup.

14:35.416 --> 14:36.249
Ahh ha...

14:36.250 --> 14:37.626
Isn't Judd coming to fix this?

14:37.627 --> 14:38.752
No, I'm gonna fix it.

14:38.753 --> 14:39.424
But Mom said...

14:39.425 --> 14:43.256
Ahh... son, let me tell
you how the world works.

14:43.257 --> 14:46.136
Women have this crazy notion
that they know what's best...

14:46.137 --> 14:47.803
but they don't.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.681
The more that you
stick to your guns,

14:49.682 --> 14:51.728
the better off you're gonna
be, let me tell you.

14:51.729 --> 14:54.434
All right, Grandpa.

14:54.435 --> 14:58.939
Well that... that looks good.

14:58.940 --> 15:01.608
This place reminds
me of Mayberry.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.485
You know the show?

15:03.486 --> 15:06.071
It's like time passed you by.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.868
So is there anyone in this place

15:07.869 --> 15:09.287
that we should be worried about,

15:09.288 --> 15:11.785
any anti-government types,

15:11.786 --> 15:15.288
freaks of society?

15:15.289 --> 15:18.755
No, everyone here is fairly
normal, pretty supportive.

15:18.756 --> 15:20.547
How about photographers,
publicity seekers?

15:20.548 --> 15:23.130
We want to try and keep
Lancer's whereabouts a secret.

15:23.131 --> 15:23.757
With the Internet?

15:23.758 --> 15:25.051
Good luck with that.

15:25.052 --> 15:26.892
Yeah, well if we could
keep it to a minimum,

15:26.893 --> 15:29.886
I consider that a win.

15:29.887 --> 15:33.937
No, I don't think you're gonna
have trouble with anyone.

16:32.825 --> 16:33.783
Yes?

16:33.784 --> 16:35.627
Hello ma'am, is your
husband at home?

16:35.628 --> 16:38.371
<i>No... I'm uh, no.</i>

16:38.372 --> 16:39.965
Is that your truck outside?

16:39.966 --> 16:41.833
That, that's my father's.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.001
Is he home?

16:43.002 --> 16:45.003
And you are?

16:45.004 --> 16:46.381
Eugene Young, Secret Service.

16:46.382 --> 16:48.965
As you know, the president's
going to be in town today.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.058
Since your house
overlooks everything,

16:50.059 --> 16:52.474
we're here to set up
a security station.

16:52.475 --> 16:55.972
Um... Dad?

16:55.973 --> 16:58.683
So you, you're from Washington?

16:58.684 --> 16:59.809
You're from Suddenly?

16:59.810 --> 17:02.484
Yes, yeah... born and raised.

17:05.608 --> 17:08.652
Marine Corp ring...

17:08.653 --> 17:10.028
How did you know?

17:10.029 --> 17:12.327
Excuse me...

17:15.785 --> 17:18.619
Come on in...

17:18.621 --> 17:20.874
Dad I.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.300
This'll do.

17:32.593 --> 17:33.927
What's going on?

17:33.928 --> 17:36.972
Dad, Dad... uh, these
gentlemen are here

17:36.973 --> 17:38.475
to protect the president.

17:38.476 --> 17:40.892
And I'm sorry, I
didn't get your names.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.440
This is Agent Hemming
and I'm Agent Young,

17:42.441 --> 17:43.356
Secret Service.

17:43.357 --> 17:44.354
And you're Mister...?

17:44.355 --> 17:45.730
Uh... Pete.

17:45.731 --> 17:48.358
So, you're here for
the president?

17:48.359 --> 17:50.327
We just need to set up
a security checkpoint

17:50.328 --> 17:51.861
if you don't mind.

17:51.862 --> 17:56.074
No, no... not at all.

17:56.075 --> 17:59.578
Would you gentlemen care
for some coffee, or...?

17:59.579 --> 18:01.871
No thanks.

18:01.872 --> 18:02.622
I remember when I
was your age...

18:02.623 --> 18:04.045
how old are you, 6 or 7?

18:04.046 --> 18:05.500
Uh... 11.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.794
Pidge!

18:07.795 --> 18:09.047
The sky's the limit, hey kid?

18:09.048 --> 18:11.261
If you're going to
dream, dream big.

18:11.262 --> 18:13.258
Never let anyone
tell you what to do.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.353
You get yourself a vision,
you hang onto it.

18:15.354 --> 18:19.180
And make sure to stay in school.

18:19.181 --> 18:24.185
Hemming, this is
where he's gonna be.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.905
I think these guys
are phonies...

18:29.066 --> 18:30.989
Anyone else live here
besides you guys?

18:30.990 --> 18:32.485
No.

18:32.486 --> 18:34.784
It's a big house for
just the three of you.

18:34.785 --> 18:36.990
Well I have three brothers.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.617
And they live where?

18:38.618 --> 18:40.118
Out of town.

18:40.119 --> 18:43.121
Anyone been by here today?

18:43.122 --> 18:44.873
Uh no, I mean like who?

18:44.874 --> 18:47.923
Do you have anywhere
you need to be?

18:49.920 --> 18:51.134
Sorry, I don't understand...

18:51.135 --> 18:52.347
Is anyone expecting you?

18:52.348 --> 18:54.966
Any appointments, errands,

18:54.967 --> 18:57.302
maybe a coffee date with
one of the soccer moms?

18:57.303 --> 18:59.054
It's the small stuff
that's easy to forget.

18:59.055 --> 19:00.138
Uh... no.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.057
We're just kicking around.

19:02.058 --> 19:08.021
Oh, the power's out.

19:08.022 --> 19:10.273
Okay, well I hope
it comes on soon.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.117
Okay, we're going to check
out the rest of the house

19:12.118 --> 19:13.031
if you don't mind.

19:13.032 --> 19:15.904
No, go ahead.

19:15.905 --> 19:18.499
Thank you.

19:20.368 --> 19:24.704
Pidge, hands off
anything in here.

19:24.705 --> 19:25.957
I wanna see what
he's trying to do...

19:25.958 --> 19:27.170
I don't know, Tod called

19:27.171 --> 19:29.292
and he said they
were gonna stop by.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.091
We took the liberty of
walking around your house

19:31.092 --> 19:33.088
before we knocked on
the front door...

19:33.089 --> 19:35.933
I noticed there were bars on the
bathroom and basement windows.

19:35.934 --> 19:38.385
Well we had a break in.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.637
10 years ago, Dad.

19:40.638 --> 19:43.431
Well it helps me sleep at night.

19:43.432 --> 19:45.275
And what about the
other windows?

19:45.276 --> 19:48.103
Well, they're wired.

19:48.104 --> 19:50.027
Oh, a lot of good that'll
do if the power's out.

19:50.028 --> 19:51.856
Yeah...

19:51.857 --> 19:53.358
I'm just gonna take a look
back here for a second.

19:53.359 --> 19:56.283
Sure.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.082
What about over
here, what is this?

20:07.748 --> 20:10.083
That's it.

20:10.084 --> 20:13.002
Sorry for the clutter.

20:13.003 --> 20:15.927
All right, let's go back up.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.795
You okay, Dad?

20:58.883 --> 21:00.425
It's fine.

21:00.426 --> 21:01.176
We're gonna be here for a while,

21:01.177 --> 21:03.145
would you mind if we
used your garage?

21:03.146 --> 21:03.646
Um...

21:09.018 --> 21:11.396
Do we have a choice?

21:15.149 --> 21:16.071
How long is a while?

21:16.072 --> 21:17.025
I don't know.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.151
Tod said they were
just gonna stop by.

21:18.152 --> 21:19.277
That's weird.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.452
It's fine.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.797
You're calm now, Tod?

21:38.798 --> 21:42.302
Just so you know, and this
isn't coming from me, Nate,

21:42.303 --> 21:44.395
you have to close.

21:47.056 --> 21:48.433
I got a business to run.

21:48.434 --> 21:50.683
Not today you don't.

21:50.684 --> 21:51.901
I got a right to run a business

21:51.902 --> 21:54.397
just the same as you got a
right to get pissed drunk,

21:54.398 --> 21:57.857
wake up in a ditch and
still put on that uniform.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.952
I'm not gonna ask you again.

22:01.529 --> 22:05.323
Why don't you fuck off
before I kick your ass?

22:05.324 --> 22:08.168
Give that sweet Ellen
what she's been missing.

22:09.370 --> 22:10.328
Tod!

22:10.329 --> 22:12.582
Get the fuck off me, I'm
taking him to jail.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.465
What the hell?

22:18.963 --> 22:20.556
Oh you're fucked now, Tod!

22:24.176 --> 22:26.219
Hey, hey, undo the cuffs.

22:26.220 --> 22:27.887
Undo the cuffs!

22:27.888 --> 22:29.305
You fuck!

22:29.306 --> 22:32.267
You fuck, undo them!

22:32.268 --> 22:39.152
Fucking war hero!

22:42.236 --> 22:46.573
Hey Tod, you're fucked buddy!

22:46.574 --> 22:48.326
Who's fucked?

22:52.121 --> 22:55.000
I'm fucked.

23:52.890 --> 23:54.312
Can we go down and see
the president, Grandpa?

23:54.313 --> 23:56.434
I'm sorry, I can't allow that.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.353
Why can't the boy go?

23:58.354 --> 23:59.479
Because the whole town
is shutting down,

23:59.480 --> 24:02.402
we have security closing down
roads and stores as we speak.

24:02.403 --> 24:04.367
Well surely you
don't need us here.

24:04.368 --> 24:05.360
Yes we do.

24:05.361 --> 24:06.361
Why?

24:06.362 --> 24:07.028
Because.

24:07.029 --> 24:08.071
Because why?

24:08.072 --> 24:09.369
Because we're in charge.

24:09.370 --> 24:11.240
Just draw a triangle...

24:11.241 --> 24:13.618
it's the president, us, and
then the bottom feeders...

24:13.619 --> 24:14.452
you get it?

24:14.453 --> 24:18.549
Excuse me!

24:20.376 --> 24:23.211
We got company.

24:23.212 --> 24:24.420
Basement...

24:24.421 --> 24:27.298
Oh my gosh!

24:27.299 --> 24:29.384
What is this?

24:29.385 --> 24:30.510
Oh my gosh!

24:30.511 --> 24:32.730
Dad I.

24:33.889 --> 24:34.856
Just please don't...

24:34.857 --> 24:37.392
Get down there now!

24:37.393 --> 24:41.312
Dad just do what they say!

24:41.313 --> 24:43.277
You give us away,
I'll kill them.

24:43.278 --> 24:45.738
You take longer than a
minute, I'll kill them.

24:45.739 --> 24:47.281
Don't give me an
excuse, old man.

24:47.282 --> 24:48.319
No...

24:48.320 --> 24:50.914
Hey, don't forget to smile!

24:54.702 --> 24:58.496
Come on, come on!

24:58.497 --> 25:01.341
Let's go, let's go.

25:09.717 --> 25:10.800
Mr. Howard?

25:10.801 --> 25:11.551
Yes.

25:11.552 --> 25:13.970
I'm Agent Carney, this
is Agent Haggerty.

25:13.971 --> 25:15.564
We're going door to door
doing walk throughs,

25:15.565 --> 25:17.140
mind if we come in?

25:17.141 --> 25:18.307
Uh...

25:18.308 --> 25:19.400
We won't be very long.

25:19.401 --> 25:21.477
I... I don't have any guns!

25:21.478 --> 25:22.729
Were glad to hear that.

25:22.730 --> 25:25.481
May we?

25:25.482 --> 25:28.076
Uh yeah, I suppose so.

25:53.594 --> 25:54.390
Great view up there.

25:54.391 --> 25:57.388
Oh, thank you.

25:57.389 --> 25:58.561
You live with family?

25:58.562 --> 26:01.350
Uh, my daughter and her son.

26:01.351 --> 26:03.394
Where are they?

26:03.395 --> 26:04.729
Well, uh...

26:04.730 --> 26:08.357
Are they here Mr. Howard?

26:08.358 --> 26:10.193
Well the boy decided
to play hooky

26:10.194 --> 26:11.741
and my daughter's
gone to look for him.

26:11.742 --> 26:13.908
We're actually, we're
quite worried.

26:13.909 --> 26:14.953
Is he about 11 years old?

26:14.954 --> 26:15.865
Yes.

26:15.866 --> 26:17.118
Saw him down at the
Sheriff's office.

26:17.119 --> 26:18.576
Oh, that's him.

26:18.577 --> 26:19.452
Yeah, they sent him home.

26:19.453 --> 26:21.537
Well he didn't come home.

26:21.538 --> 26:22.914
Listen, how long are
you going to be?

26:22.915 --> 26:25.759
I'd like to go out with my
daughter and try and find him.

26:25.760 --> 26:27.293
We're almost done.

26:27.294 --> 26:28.671
Yeah, kids these days...
they have no discipline.

26:28.672 --> 26:30.843
No...

26:34.802 --> 26:36.224
Something wrong
with your lights?

26:36.225 --> 26:40.098
Uh, I sort of wrecked the power.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.522
Uh, the box is in the
kitchen and I...

26:42.523 --> 26:46.687
I was working on it when the
boy decided to play hooky.

26:46.688 --> 26:48.064
Things were different
when we were kids, huh?

26:48.065 --> 26:50.233
Uh, I suppose, yeah.

26:50.234 --> 26:52.453
Again, how long
are you gonna be?

26:52.454 --> 26:55.948
I have a lot to do
before it gets dark.

27:01.578 --> 27:04.297
Haggerty. Let's go!

27:07.626 --> 27:08.751
We're sorry for any
inconvenience.

27:08.752 --> 27:12.256
Uh, that's okay...

27:16.552 --> 27:19.351
Thanks again.

27:33.443 --> 27:36.904
Can you please just be
gentle with my son?

27:36.905 --> 27:39.907
They're gone!

27:39.908 --> 27:42.457
Thank you.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.649
Get out of the way.

28:07.769 --> 28:09.646
Barren!

28:12.274 --> 28:13.776
CONKLIN...

28:34.671 --> 28:37.089
Well it's definitely
the right house.

28:37.090 --> 28:38.057
You know when I drove into town,

28:38.058 --> 28:40.096
everybody was doing
exactly what we were told

28:40.097 --> 28:41.513
they were gonna be doing.

28:41.514 --> 28:44.013
There's the empty
lot, the photo op,

28:44.014 --> 28:45.266
the bullshit ceremony
of the president

28:45.267 --> 28:47.934
getting the key to the town...

28:47.935 --> 28:49.903
I don't know how our
people figured this out

28:49.904 --> 28:54.023
but this is definitely
the right house, man.

28:54.024 --> 28:56.322
Where's Virgil,
is he in the car?

28:56.323 --> 28:59.779
Don't worry about Virgil.

28:59.780 --> 29:03.532
I think there was a trust issue.

29:03.533 --> 29:06.878
Oh, so you did what you
had to do, didn't you?

29:13.669 --> 29:16.969
I suppose someone's
looking after us.

29:22.594 --> 29:25.596
There's no sense in
working yourself up.

29:25.597 --> 29:28.391
I mean, we'll just sit
this out, it'll go away.

29:28.392 --> 29:30.690
I mean if we cooperate there's
not going to be any problem.

29:30.691 --> 29:32.979
Dad... Dad, you don't know that.

29:32.980 --> 29:35.074
Oh come on, we don't
know what they can do.

29:35.075 --> 29:38.069
Yeah, exactly.

29:39.611 --> 29:40.908
Look Pidge, pack up all
the tools that you can.

29:40.909 --> 29:43.114
All right.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.699
Get the toolbox, Pidge.

29:44.700 --> 29:45.700
All right.

29:45.701 --> 29:46.918
It's in the bottom there.

29:46.919 --> 29:49.254
The shelf, that's it, good boy.

29:51.707 --> 29:52.707
Watch out Grandpa.

29:52.708 --> 29:55.006
Yeah, good.

29:59.089 --> 30:02.216
Hey... you know
Barren killed Virgil

30:02.217 --> 30:03.890
before he got in
the car with you,

30:03.891 --> 30:08.639
then I disposed of the body.
Barren had zero remorse.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.730
Yeah, but whose
side was Virgil on?

30:10.731 --> 30:11.726
You're kidding me.

30:11.727 --> 30:13.269
I'm just saying...

30:13.270 --> 30:16.240
What, you think Virgil would
really set you up like that?

30:16.241 --> 30:18.905
Whatever Barren says.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.779
What do you think?

30:23.780 --> 30:26.782
I'm not being paid to think.

30:26.783 --> 30:28.330
Yeah, well I got a feeling
Barren's not telling us

30:28.331 --> 30:29.785
the whole story.

30:29.786 --> 30:30.661
Fuck you, CONKLIN.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.835
Don't start questioning
things now,

30:32.836 --> 30:34.498
they got us this far.

30:34.499 --> 30:37.168
You ever met anyone
on this committee?

30:37.169 --> 30:38.671
You really believe they're
just gonna come down

30:38.672 --> 30:40.713
and introduce themselves?

30:40.714 --> 30:41.802
That's not how it works,

30:41.803 --> 30:43.969
you and me are a very small
part of a large machine.

30:43.970 --> 30:46.846
They selected us and you can
either shut the fuck up

30:46.847 --> 30:49.394
or you can join Virgil.

30:52.768 --> 30:54.941
Hey... I get the heavy one, huh?

31:16.208 --> 31:18.709
When do we knock
off the family?

31:18.710 --> 31:20.086
Don't be a fucking idiot.

31:20.087 --> 31:23.130
You're a fucking idiot!

31:23.131 --> 31:25.259
You murder an old man,
a mother and son,

31:25.260 --> 31:27.259
you lose all sympathy
for the 'cause.

31:27.260 --> 31:29.970
Nobody wants another
Timothy McVeigh.

31:29.971 --> 31:30.971
You jeopardize the
greater good,

31:30.972 --> 31:34.317
they'll come down on both of
us like a fucking hammer.

31:47.739 --> 31:50.743
Fucking marksman you are.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.242
Oh Ellen, now be reasonable.

33:10.243 --> 33:10.821
Shh!

33:10.822 --> 33:12.870
I mean, the town is
filled with cops.

33:12.871 --> 33:16.911
I mean if we're missed, people
will come looking for us.

33:16.912 --> 33:17.788
I don't think so, Dad.

33:17.789 --> 33:18.834
Well what about Tod?

33:18.835 --> 33:19.455
Tod?

33:19.456 --> 33:20.958
I just told him the power's out

33:20.959 --> 33:23.085
and he might not be able
to get a hold of me.

33:23.086 --> 33:24.006
Can we unscrew these?

33:24.007 --> 33:26.253
You can't do any of those.

33:26.254 --> 33:27.922
You need a saw.

33:27.923 --> 33:29.965
How about this?

33:29.966 --> 33:31.800
Oh, that a boy Pidge!

33:31.801 --> 33:34.350
Here's what you need.

33:36.181 --> 33:37.139
Shh!

33:37.140 --> 33:40.392
Pidge, go see if
you can listen.

33:40.393 --> 33:42.737
I think it's safe.

33:49.986 --> 33:51.704
Tod...

33:53.406 --> 33:54.077
What's up?

33:54.078 --> 33:55.701
Sit down.

34:00.956 --> 34:04.667
What's going on?

34:04.668 --> 34:08.003
I thought you promised
to go to those meetings.

34:08.004 --> 34:08.963
Yeah...

34:08.964 --> 34:11.924
it just didn't
work out too good.

34:11.925 --> 34:13.302
You're only here because
of me you know.

34:13.303 --> 34:15.641
I tried calling my sponsor
but he wasn't there,

34:15.641 --> 34:17.012
and then I went and...

34:17.013 --> 34:18.310
I heard you spent the night
drinking and gambling,

34:18.311 --> 34:19.889
got your ass whooped.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.934
Not one of my better moments.

34:21.935 --> 34:24.186
Fourth time this month...

34:24.187 --> 34:29.900
and now I gotta deal with Nate.

34:29.900 --> 34:32.322
You're supposed to
enforce the law.

34:32.322 --> 34:33.663
Well it's a difficult line,

34:33.664 --> 34:37.032
especially with
someone like him.

34:37.033 --> 34:40.286
Give me your gun.

34:40.286 --> 34:40.995
What?

34:40.996 --> 34:42.746
Give me your gun.

34:42.746 --> 34:43.462
I'm not gonna shoot...

34:43.463 --> 34:44.252
We either do it this way

34:44.253 --> 34:46.297
or I give you a full
suspension, you got it?

34:46.297 --> 34:54.049
Here, have the whole thing.

34:54.050 --> 34:55.391
Until you get yourself
under control,

34:55.391 --> 34:56.385
I'm not giving this back.

34:56.386 --> 34:57.970
I'm in control!

34:57.971 --> 34:58.767
You're not in control!

34:58.768 --> 35:00.139
You're angry all the time.

35:00.140 --> 35:01.187
I don't know what
you're talking about.

35:01.188 --> 35:03.434
Don't bullshit me!

35:03.435 --> 35:07.605
Look at you, you're a mess.

35:07.606 --> 35:10.576
You ﬂy off the handle every
time somebody bumps into you.

35:10.577 --> 35:16.322
Now why do you have to fight
with everybody all the time?

35:16.323 --> 35:16.947
I don't know.

35:16.948 --> 35:17.995
What do you want me to say?

35:17.996 --> 35:21.916
I want you to tell me the truth.

35:25.749 --> 35:29.001
I'm just having a difficult
time, that's all.

35:29.002 --> 35:30.502
What difficult time?

35:30.503 --> 35:33.714
It's just...

35:33.715 --> 35:36.008
stuff with Ellen, that's all.

35:36.009 --> 35:37.009
You're a bullshit poker player.

35:37.010 --> 35:38.510
I'm not bluffing!

35:38.511 --> 35:41.680
Okay, okay... if
that's the case,

35:41.681 --> 35:43.934
<i>then the sooner you two
work out this crap,</i>

35:43.935 --> 35:45.559
the sooner you get
out of this rut.

35:45.560 --> 35:46.060
I'm trying.

35:46.061 --> 35:50.648
Now whether it works out for
you or not, I don't care.

35:50.649 --> 35:53.994
You just finalize
something and move on.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.328
Hey Reg, do me a favor...

36:01.329 --> 36:03.077
go up to Ellen's
and check on her,

36:03.078 --> 36:05.788
and make sure that
Pidge showed up.

36:05.789 --> 36:07.382
Uh... yeah, I could do that.

36:07.383 --> 36:09.877
Good.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.932
Shh!

36:24.933 --> 36:27.732
Dad, shh!

36:34.943 --> 36:36.151
Not very sharp.

36:36.152 --> 36:38.112
Here, let me try.

36:38.113 --> 36:40.241
Let me try...

36:50.208 --> 36:52.336
Wheeler.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.839
Find something?

36:56.840 --> 36:59.309
Shut the door.

37:03.596 --> 37:06.725
What did CONKLIN say to you?

37:08.351 --> 37:11.854
Outside he was talking
to you, what did he say?

37:11.855 --> 37:12.896
Nothing.

37:12.897 --> 37:15.899
You want me to keep
an eye on him?

37:15.900 --> 37:19.780
Worry about yourself.

37:21.322 --> 37:22.289
They gave us one of those

37:22.290 --> 37:25.284
when they sent my
brother's body back.

37:25.285 --> 37:30.289
My mother threw it away.

37:30.290 --> 37:31.832
That's the problem,

37:31.833 --> 37:34.423
it doesn't mean the
same thing anymore.

37:34.424 --> 37:36.133
The great men and
women of this country

37:36.134 --> 37:38.598
used to sacrifice their
lives for this flag,

37:38.599 --> 37:41.594
no questions asked.

37:44.220 --> 37:48.265
No questions asked...

37:48.266 --> 37:49.358
If we're prepared to
do anything we can

37:49.359 --> 37:52.728
to achieve our goals,

37:52.729 --> 37:57.608
then the American people can
stand tall and proud once more.

37:57.609 --> 38:00.158
And America can regain
it's rightful place

38:00.159 --> 38:04.750
as the greatest
country on Earth.

38:17.253 --> 38:20.172
I don't think I can do it.

38:20.173 --> 38:22.299
Of course you can,

38:22.300 --> 38:25.260
you're the best
marksman out there.

38:25.261 --> 38:30.188
God gave you a gift, use it.

38:47.158 --> 38:51.370
So, you wanna tell
me what happened?

38:51.371 --> 38:52.246
Why bother?

38:52.247 --> 38:54.164
You're on his side.

38:54.165 --> 38:55.040
I promise you Nate,

38:55.041 --> 38:57.459
I haven't made my mind up yet.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.461
Well I'm charging
him with assault.

38:59.462 --> 39:01.171
He was doing his job!

39:01.172 --> 39:02.798
He was assaulting me!

39:02.799 --> 39:04.972
I think preparations for
a presidential visit

39:04.973 --> 39:06.635
changes the rules.

39:06.636 --> 39:08.684
Yeah, see this is exactly the
bullshit I was talking about,

39:08.685 --> 39:09.805
you're biased.

39:09.806 --> 39:11.399
Nate, I can charge
you with obstruction

39:11.400 --> 39:13.769
of a law enforcement officer
and possible conspiracy

39:13.770 --> 39:17.020
against the president.

39:17.021 --> 39:17.816
Now all I wanna do

39:17.817 --> 39:20.192
is resolve this situation
as quickly as you,

39:20.193 --> 39:23.652
so what do you say?

39:23.653 --> 39:28.282
Fine, I won't press charges.

39:28.283 --> 39:30.752
Good.

40:04.027 --> 40:07.122
Barren?

40:12.368 --> 40:13.460
We're almost done
clearing the house.

40:13.461 --> 40:15.454
How's it looking in town?

40:15.455 --> 40:18.707
Uh... good, I think.

40:18.708 --> 40:20.381
Well we couldn't have done
it without your assistance,

40:20.382 --> 40:22.878
I hope you get
recognized for that.

40:22.879 --> 40:24.424
Although, between you and me,

40:24.425 --> 40:26.971
these things have a way of
slipping through the cracks.

40:26.972 --> 40:31.887
Hero for a day, the
rest is silence.

40:31.888 --> 40:35.265
I... I appreciate that.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.142
Can I speak to Ellen?

40:37.143 --> 40:38.352
Ellen?

40:38.353 --> 40:40.354
Uh, the woman who lives here?

40:40.355 --> 40:41.605
Oh yeah.

40:41.606 --> 40:43.315
Yeah, I'll grab her.

40:43.316 --> 40:46.946
Hold on, one second.

40:56.412 --> 40:58.205
He wants to see the woman.

40:58.206 --> 41:01.301
Okay, get her.

41:05.546 --> 41:08.924
Typical, she wants to put
a little makeup on first.

41:08.925 --> 41:12.555
Women, slow as molasses.

41:14.722 --> 41:15.889
Mom... Mom!

41:15.890 --> 41:18.684
Mom!

41:18.685 --> 41:20.352
Lady?

41:20.353 --> 41:23.480
Yeah... yeah.

41:23.481 --> 41:26.483
You're wanted upstairs.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.652
Uh, just me?

41:28.653 --> 41:29.575
This isn't about choice.

41:29.576 --> 41:30.946
Get out of the way, kid.

41:30.947 --> 41:32.244
Hey, Pidge... Pidge.

41:32.245 --> 41:34.459
Hey, what is this?

41:36.327 --> 41:38.286
What are you doing?

41:38.287 --> 41:40.460
Are you trying to get
yourself killed?

41:40.461 --> 41:42.374
Really stupid.

41:42.375 --> 41:44.292
Ellen! Ellen, play nice.

41:44.293 --> 41:45.463
Just do what you're told.

41:45.464 --> 41:46.837
They'd better not hurt her.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.463
Keep your mouth shut.

41:48.464 --> 41:49.631
Come on, move it.

41:49.632 --> 41:52.511
She'll be all right,
she's strong.

41:59.517 --> 42:02.396
How many chicks does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

42:02.397 --> 42:03.478
One.

42:03.479 --> 42:04.479
One to hold it in place

42:04.480 --> 42:07.700
while the rest of the world
revolves around her.

42:07.701 --> 42:09.401
Oh, here she is.

42:09.402 --> 42:11.111
Finally!

42:11.112 --> 42:13.321
Hey.

42:13.322 --> 42:16.246
Tod just wanted me to
make sure you're okay.

42:16.247 --> 42:17.367
Oh yeah, fine.

42:17.368 --> 42:18.744
We're, yeah...

42:18.745 --> 42:19.870
I mean he probably
tried to call me

42:19.871 --> 42:23.957
but my battery died and then...
the power went out,

42:23.958 --> 42:25.926
there was a short and
Dad tried to fix it

42:25.927 --> 42:32.632
and of course now nothing works.

42:32.633 --> 42:34.468
Not your day.

42:34.469 --> 42:37.095
No...

42:37.096 --> 42:40.432
though I must say it's pretty
exciting about the president.

42:40.433 --> 42:41.183
I mean, the agents...

42:41.184 --> 42:44.686
they've been telling
me all about it, so...

42:44.687 --> 42:47.566
Yeah that's the thing, Tod's
been busy with everything,

42:47.567 --> 42:49.983
gotta lock down the town.

42:49.984 --> 42:53.403
Of course.

42:53.404 --> 42:55.577
He also wanted me to
ask if Pidge got home.

42:55.578 --> 42:58.042
Oh...

43:01.079 --> 43:02.079
Did he?

43:02.080 --> 43:05.252
You know he was home one minute
and then gone the next...

43:05.253 --> 43:07.459
Anything we should
be worried about?

43:07.460 --> 43:08.585
No, nothing out of the usual,

43:08.586 --> 43:13.423
just maybe I should
put a leash on him.

43:13.424 --> 43:14.471
Put up an electric dog fence.

43:14.472 --> 43:17.094
Maybe, maybe right?

43:17.095 --> 43:22.317
I'll let Tod know, see ya.

43:22.725 --> 43:27.562
Oh hey Reg, tell Tod I had
a great time last night.

43:27.563 --> 43:29.606
Okay...

43:29.607 --> 43:32.907
Okay.

43:46.082 --> 43:47.791
Pidge the dog?

43:47.792 --> 43:48.542
Yeah.

43:48.543 --> 43:50.127
Where is he?

43:50.128 --> 43:50.752
I...

43:50.753 --> 43:54.089
He'd better not
bring anyone back.

43:54.090 --> 43:56.593
Downstairs.

44:05.726 --> 44:08.525
So what do you think?

44:09.647 --> 44:10.739
Did they do anything?

44:10.740 --> 44:12.274
No Dad, I'm fine.

44:12.275 --> 44:14.698
I told you we had to
play by their rules.

44:14.699 --> 44:15.777
Reg was here.

44:15.778 --> 44:19.322
Oh, is he still there?

44:19.323 --> 44:20.240
No.

44:20.241 --> 44:22.835
Will he come back?

44:30.084 --> 44:32.085
Well I talked to Nate,

44:32.086 --> 44:35.340
he's not gonna press charges
if you stay away from him.

44:35.341 --> 44:38.011
Never show up at Harlow's
to play cards ever again.

44:38.012 --> 44:39.009
I'd lose anyway.

44:39.010 --> 44:41.678
It's not a joke Tod.

44:41.679 --> 44:43.147
I don't know where all
the bravado comes from

44:43.148 --> 44:46.558
but I'd shut up
with the comments.

44:46.559 --> 44:48.277
It's no wonder Pidge
is the way he is

44:48.278 --> 44:52.147
if you're the only
example he's got.

44:52.148 --> 44:54.697
Don't make me look bad
by fucking this up.

44:54.698 --> 44:55.734
I won't.

44:55.735 --> 44:57.658
'Cause I don't go on the line
for just anybody, you got it?

44:57.659 --> 45:00.572
No, I know!

45:00.573 --> 45:02.951
Come on.

45:20.676 --> 45:22.552
Are... are we gonna die?

45:22.553 --> 45:24.012
No, hey...

45:24.013 --> 45:26.516
Pidge, I'm not gonna
let that happen,

45:26.517 --> 45:28.108
we're gonna gel out of here.

45:28.109 --> 45:29.559
Dad died.

45:29.560 --> 45:32.479
Pidge...

45:32.480 --> 45:34.606
come here.

45:34.607 --> 45:36.566
Thatta boy.

45:36.567 --> 45:38.990
Listen uh, did I ever
tell you about the time

45:38.991 --> 45:43.573
your mother was your age and
we bought this old car?

45:43.574 --> 45:45.292
With a couple of your uncles we
were driving across the state

45:45.293 --> 45:48.745
to visit your great
grandmother for Thanksgiving.

45:48.746 --> 45:51.625
The thing was, we had an
early snowfall that year

45:51.626 --> 45:54.503
<i>and as we started to
drive, it started to snow</i>

45:54.504 --> 45:57.170
and it came down and
down and down...

45:57.171 --> 45:59.843
and my Lord, before long we're
in the middle of a whiteout!

45:59.844 --> 46:02.592
Couldn't see 10 feet in front
of us, 10 feet behind us!

46:02.593 --> 46:04.641
And there's so much snow
that it stopped the car

46:04.642 --> 46:08.807
right in the middle of the
road and then the car died.

46:08.808 --> 46:10.183
So what'd you do?

46:10.184 --> 46:12.605
Well, I didn't want to get
in the car and start it up

46:12.606 --> 46:14.649
because it'd wear
down the battery,

46:14.650 --> 46:16.866
so I thought we'd just
sit there for a while.

46:16.867 --> 46:20.652
So we did and it
started to get cold,

46:20.653 --> 46:23.196
I mean it got colder
and colder and colder

46:23.197 --> 46:24.665
and then finally your
grandmother says,

46:24.666 --> 46:26.578
why don't you go out
there and look for help?

46:26.579 --> 46:30.250
I said, oh no... well be okay,
something will come along,

46:30.251 --> 46:31.621
we'll be fine.

46:31.622 --> 46:34.833
And then before you knew it...

46:34.834 --> 46:36.501
So what happened?

46:36.502 --> 46:37.754
Then a snowplow came.

46:37.755 --> 46:39.838
Yeah, a snowplow.

46:39.839 --> 46:43.137
Put a charge on the battery
and then plowed us out

46:43.138 --> 46:45.387
so that we were on the
road and on our way.

46:45.388 --> 46:46.057
So you see?

46:46.058 --> 46:46.803
Hey?

46:46.804 --> 46:48.602
It all worked out
well in the end.

46:49.598 --> 46:50.765
Thanks Grandpa.

46:50.766 --> 46:52.809
Oh you're welcome, my son.

46:52.810 --> 46:53.935
Good boy.

46:53.936 --> 46:55.904
That was our last
Thanksgiving with Mom.

46:55.905 --> 46:58.615
Yeah, it was.

47:06.449 --> 47:10.035
Ahh... well, we got
everything blocked off

47:10.036 --> 47:12.539
from Hilary to Clyde
on the north side,

47:12.540 --> 47:14.414
Secret Service has
finalized everything else

47:14.415 --> 47:16.088
all the way up to
the laundry mat.

47:19.795 --> 47:21.841
I thought they didn't
want any publicity.

47:21.842 --> 47:24.554
Well, different departments
want different things.

47:24.555 --> 47:27.302
Some white house rep
thinks it's a good idea.

47:27.303 --> 47:28.892
The president's gonna land,

47:28.893 --> 47:31.560
the mayor and Gail are gonna
present him with a gift,

47:31.561 --> 47:34.106
couple of photographs and
then the mayor moves on.

47:34.107 --> 47:37.312
Sheriff, I covered Lincoln
Street and Powell.

47:37.313 --> 47:40.273
Sally's gonna keep the
diner open 'til 8,

47:40.274 --> 47:41.070
hand out free coffee.

47:41.071 --> 47:43.068
Sally? Free coffee?

47:43.069 --> 47:45.197
That woman's tighter
than a clam!

47:45.198 --> 47:46.409
Have you seen Agent Carney?

47:46.410 --> 47:47.906
He's probably stuck
over at Mills',

47:47.907 --> 47:50.205
his wife could talk
the leg off a table.

47:50.206 --> 47:52.035
How's Ellen?

47:52.036 --> 47:53.703
Oh she's fine.

47:53.704 --> 47:55.794
Um, Pidge ran off again though.

47:55.795 --> 47:57.129
Is he still acting up?

47:57.130 --> 47:58.797
You think I got problems...

47:58.798 --> 48:03.338
Oh, she also said that she
had a good time last night.

48:03.339 --> 48:04.756
<i>Mu you guys-J?</i>

48:04.757 --> 48:06.758
What?

48:06.759 --> 48:09.182
All right come on,
come on let's go.

48:09.183 --> 48:12.933
She said she had a good time.

48:16.435 --> 48:17.227
Thanks.

48:17.228 --> 48:18.978
Yeah.

48:18.979 --> 48:20.401
So I'll stick around here.

48:20.402 --> 48:24.442
Yeah okay, good man.

48:24.443 --> 48:26.569
Can you hear that?

48:26.570 --> 48:31.574
I can't hear anything, it's
awfully quiet up there.

48:31.575 --> 48:34.670
I wonder what they're doing...

49:43.981 --> 49:44.777
Can I help you?

49:44.778 --> 49:47.151
Hey...

49:49.361 --> 49:50.783
I haven't met you,
I'm deputy Reid.

49:50.784 --> 49:51.779
Agent Young.

49:51.780 --> 49:53.620
Nice little town you've
got here, Deputy.

49:53.621 --> 49:54.868
Oh, we're proud of it.

49:54.869 --> 49:57.202
Well you missed Agent
Carney by about 10 minutes,

49:57.203 --> 49:59.204
if you need him you'll have
to track him down yourself,

49:59.205 --> 50:01.831
I've been told to stay here.

50:01.832 --> 50:04.709
I actually came to see Ellen.

50:04.710 --> 50:07.795
She left too, she went
looking for Pidge.

50:07.796 --> 50:10.256
Did he run off again?

50:10.257 --> 50:11.725
I don't know the
details, Deputy.

50:12.968 --> 50:14.390
That kid, he's funny.

50:14.391 --> 50:18.598
Uh... all right.

50:18.599 --> 50:20.818
Do you know what
direction they went?

50:20.819 --> 50:21.935
Nope.

50:21.936 --> 50:24.815
But her cell phone's dead, you
won't be able to call her.

50:24.816 --> 50:28.363
She wanted me to tell you that.

50:31.028 --> 50:33.404
Huh...

50:33.405 --> 50:35.823
Okay.

50:35.824 --> 50:37.121
What's your name again?

50:37.122 --> 50:38.034
Agent what?

50:38.035 --> 50:38.826
Young.

50:38.827 --> 50:39.702
Young... Marcus Young.

50:39.703 --> 50:40.828
Yeah, I'm not good with names.

50:40.829 --> 50:42.288
Young.

50:42.289 --> 50:46.385
See you around Deputy and
keep up the good work.

51:29.753 --> 51:32.848
Dad, Tod's here!

51:33.966 --> 51:34.888
Can he see us?

51:34.889 --> 51:35.883
I don't know.

51:35.884 --> 51:38.103
Tod!

51:41.682 --> 51:43.558
Okay...

51:43.559 --> 51:45.268
There he is.

51:45.269 --> 51:47.312
Dad, stand back you guys.

51:47.313 --> 51:48.771
Are you ready?

51:48.772 --> 51:51.025
Stand back.

51:53.569 --> 51:56.321
Hey! Tod!

51:56.322 --> 51:59.075
Tod! They're trying to
kill the president!

51:59.076 --> 52:02.248
Get away from the window!

52:09.960 --> 52:12.463
Run Tod!

52:14.048 --> 52:14.924
What are you doing?

52:14.925 --> 52:17.175
He has a heart condition!

52:17.176 --> 52:20.053
Dad?

52:20.054 --> 52:21.977
Grandpa?

52:24.183 --> 52:26.277
Geez...

52:30.689 --> 52:32.407
Dad?

52:47.748 --> 52:49.750
Dad I.

52:55.047 --> 52:56.589
Let go of me!

52:56.590 --> 52:58.763
Get away from him!

53:00.594 --> 53:04.097
Dad... Dad... no!

53:04.098 --> 53:08.604
Daddy, no!

53:09.395 --> 53:11.896
Wheeler, CONKLIN!

53:11.897 --> 53:14.650
Get up here!

53:17.945 --> 53:24.043
Dad... Daddy... no... no!

53:40.926 --> 53:42.677
Find the cop.

53:42.678 --> 53:46.723
The old man's dead.

53:46.724 --> 53:50.024
Find the fucking cop.

54:15.461 --> 54:18.886
Pidge, come here.

54:22.134 --> 54:24.010
Grandpa...

54:24.011 --> 54:26.053
I know honey.

54:26.054 --> 54:28.473
Listen, I know...

54:28.474 --> 54:32.226
but you know what Grandpa
would want us to do, hmm?

54:32.227 --> 54:35.146
Get out of here.

54:35.147 --> 54:38.858
Listen, can you help
me bend those bars?

54:38.859 --> 54:42.033
Find something, all right?

55:42.923 --> 55:44.632
Perfect.

55:44.633 --> 55:46.133
Okay...

55:46.134 --> 55:52.107
Three, two...

56:06.154 --> 56:08.248
Get down, get down!

56:22.921 --> 56:24.923
Okay...

56:32.097 --> 56:34.225
All right, let's go.

56:35.517 --> 56:36.439
All right, ready?

56:36.440 --> 56:38.529
Three, two, one...

56:40.814 --> 56:43.567
We got it, we got it.

56:46.528 --> 56:48.326
Come on, Mom.

57:09.468 --> 57:12.053
They're not gonna
get any bigger.

57:12.054 --> 57:12.929
Pidge...

57:12.930 --> 57:14.931
No, Mom, not without you.

57:14.932 --> 57:17.683
Listen, I can't... I
can't fit through.

57:17.684 --> 57:20.061
You go to town and
you get some help.

57:20.062 --> 57:21.062
Okay?

57:21.063 --> 57:23.191
All right.

57:23.565 --> 57:25.149
You can do it, go.

57:25.150 --> 57:28.029
Just be fast.

58:06.274 --> 58:08.067
Barren, the kid got out!

58:08.068 --> 58:09.902
Run, Pidge!

58:09.903 --> 58:12.031
Run!

58:36.263 --> 58:38.806
Hey!

58:38.807 --> 58:44.603
The old man's dead,
don't make her next.

58:44.604 --> 58:46.230
Find the boy.

58:46.231 --> 58:47.448
No, don't you touch him.

58:47.449 --> 58:51.736
Don't you touch him!

58:51.737 --> 58:53.535
Inside.

58:55.365 --> 58:58.084
Come on.

59:23.477 --> 59:23.977
Ahh!

59:32.569 --> 59:33.569
Give me your hands.

59:33.570 --> 59:34.361
No!

59:34.362 --> 59:38.449
Don't be stupid,
give me your hands.

59:38.450 --> 59:39.450
Here we go.

59:39.451 --> 59:42.495
Please.

59:42.496 --> 59:44.080
Get down!

59:44.081 --> 59:46.540
Ahh!

59:46.541 --> 59:47.630
Why are you doing this?

59:47.631 --> 59:49.001
Did I say you can talk?

59:49.002 --> 59:50.424
What, you think you got
something to prove?

59:50.425 --> 59:51.712
Stop.

59:51.713 --> 59:53.089
Don't fucking hit her!

59:53.090 --> 59:53.761
You're next.

59:53.762 --> 59:56.467
Don't fucking hit her!

59:56.468 --> 59:59.893
Cooperate and this will
go a lot smoother.

01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:02.890
Look, listen to me.

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:03.641
Look at me!

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:05.559
No!

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:10.282
I tried to help your father,
there was nothing I could do.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:17.822
You okay?

01:00:17.823 --> 01:00:19.073
Ellen, you okay?

01:00:19.074 --> 01:00:21.534
Look at me, you okay?

01:00:21.535 --> 01:00:23.619
What happened to Pete?

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:25.412
They killed him.

01:00:25.413 --> 01:00:26.915
What?

01:00:30.877 --> 01:00:33.346
Oh my God.

01:00:38.426 --> 01:00:43.973
Barren, it wasn't
supposed to go like this.

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:46.016
We still have a job to do.

01:00:46.017 --> 01:00:50.396
I tried to save that old man.

01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:51.939
So you move on.

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:56.569
But the committee said no
civilian casualties...

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:58.237
and that kid, he saw me!

01:00:58.238 --> 01:01:00.614
I don't give a fuck.

01:01:00.615 --> 01:01:04.586
My only concern is the
death of this president.

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:10.583
He's destroyed my
country, your country,

01:01:10.584 --> 01:01:12.630
taken away the very
morals and principles

01:01:12.631 --> 01:01:14.503
that made this country great.

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:16.922
We have to end this.

01:01:16.923 --> 01:01:20.342
Don't you get it, CONKLIN?

01:01:20.343 --> 01:01:23.643
How come you're the only one
who's met this committee?

01:01:23.644 --> 01:01:27.768
Who's your contact over there?

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:31.645
I kept your name secret,

01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:33.480
he'd expect the same.

01:01:33.481 --> 01:01:38.736
They've abandoned
us, haven't they?

01:01:38.737 --> 01:01:42.287
Get your shit together, CONKLIN.

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:53.334
I'm not gonna be made a patsy.

01:01:53.335 --> 01:01:56.503
Neither am I.

01:01:56.504 --> 01:02:00.759
Fucking psycho, he's
fucking lost it.

01:02:07.515 --> 01:02:09.558
All right, keep on that.

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:10.935
Is Tod back yet?

01:02:10.936 --> 01:02:13.940
I haven't seen him, he's got his
priorities fucked up again.

01:02:13.941 --> 01:02:15.566
It's none of your business, Reg.

01:02:15.567 --> 01:02:17.441
It's three strikes.

01:02:17.442 --> 01:02:20.821
Keep trying.

01:02:59.693 --> 01:03:02.403
He's using the
upstairs washroom.

01:03:02.404 --> 01:03:05.781
Tod... are they
gonna hurt Pidge?

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:06.740
No...

01:03:06.741 --> 01:03:07.911
What if they hurl my Pidge?

01:03:07.912 --> 01:03:09.748
No, no, no... they're
never gonna catch him.

01:03:09.749 --> 01:03:13.122
The kid's a jackrabbit out
there, he's gonna be fine.

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:14.790
You believe me?

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:15.838
It's gonna be fine.

01:03:15.839 --> 01:03:16.750
Yeah.

01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:20.004
Okay?

01:03:20.005 --> 01:03:23.048
Sometimes I feel like...

01:03:23.049 --> 01:03:25.723
I feel like you know
him better than I do.

01:03:25.724 --> 01:03:26.468
What?

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:29.555
That's not possible.

01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:32.355
Look behind you, is
there anything around,

01:03:32.356 --> 01:03:35.436
do you see anything?

01:03:35.437 --> 01:03:36.770
Ow...

01:03:36.771 --> 01:03:40.399
Ellen, come here... we're
gonna have to play them.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.775
You understand?

01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:42.743
What do you mean?

01:03:42.744 --> 01:03:45.612
You gotta keep them
off guard, okay?

01:03:45.613 --> 01:03:48.457
Don't let them
make you a victim.

01:04:50.678 --> 01:04:54.353
How do you want me to respond?

01:04:58.561 --> 01:05:00.312
Say no problem.

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:00.813
Good.

01:05:08.113 --> 01:05:10.536
See the transformer on
the telephone pole?

01:05:10.537 --> 01:05:13.752
Just beyond that.

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.703
You see it?

01:05:16.704 --> 01:05:19.082
Good.

01:05:22.877 --> 01:05:23.844
How you doing, you holding up?

01:05:23.845 --> 01:05:26.056
Yeah.

01:05:29.843 --> 01:05:32.642
Remember what I said.

01:05:42.021 --> 01:05:45.816
Where'd you serve?

01:05:45.817 --> 01:05:49.111
Iraq.

01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:53.615
So you understand?

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:57.786
What? Do I understand what?

01:05:57.787 --> 01:06:01.248
There was no reason
for us to be there.

01:06:01.249 --> 01:06:02.626
We stopped terrorism.

01:06:02.627 --> 01:06:04.793
We stopped nothing.

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:08.046
Okay.

01:06:08.047 --> 01:06:10.095
What about you, where
did you serve?

01:06:10.096 --> 01:06:11.842
Iraq.

01:06:11.843 --> 01:06:14.562
Why did you sign up?

01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:24.438
You see something?

01:06:24.439 --> 01:06:26.862
What'd you see?

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:31.737
I know why you're doing this.

01:06:31.738 --> 01:06:33.197
Don't talk to me.

01:06:33.198 --> 01:06:36.325
It takes guts, takes
a lot of guts.

01:06:36.326 --> 01:06:38.660
Just shut up.

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:40.996
We're in the same boat.

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:44.249
We were turned into war monkeys.

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:49.880
The gap between the wealthy
is fucked, we're fucked.

01:06:49.881 --> 01:06:52.725
It's about time somebody
stood up against them,

01:06:52.726 --> 01:06:53.800
it really is.

01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:58.853
Good for you.

01:07:00.266 --> 01:07:03.685
How many are in
your organization?

01:07:03.686 --> 01:07:04.895
Enough.

01:07:04.896 --> 01:07:08.565
What's your name, by the way?

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:09.816
How many?

01:07:09.817 --> 01:07:11.902
Enough.

01:07:11.903 --> 01:07:14.780
But there are others.

01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:15.906
How do you join?

01:07:15.907 --> 01:07:18.158
You don't join, you're selected.

01:07:18.159 --> 01:07:19.243
Really?

01:07:19.244 --> 01:07:21.918
What's going on?

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:27.459
I was just curious about
your organization, how uh...

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:28.924
about the movement
you guys are in,

01:07:28.925 --> 01:07:31.764
the organization, whatever
it is, how you get in.

01:07:31.765 --> 01:07:36.343
Who selects you guys?

01:07:36.344 --> 01:07:41.765
Who's the big cheese?

01:07:41.766 --> 01:07:44.101
Today's a glorious day.

01:07:44.102 --> 01:07:46.605
Today I get to kill
the president...

01:07:49.524 --> 01:07:54.027
and rape her in front of you.

01:07:54.028 --> 01:07:59.032
Are you gonna have time for
that in your new world order?

01:07:59.033 --> 01:08:00.534
Under different circumstances,

01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:03.129
you and I could've
been good friends.

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:07.416
Oh yeah, is that supposed
to be a compliment?

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:11.545
We have the same
sense of humor.

01:08:11.546 --> 01:08:15.924
Did you and her husband have
the same sense of humor?

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:20.636
I saw the pictures upstairs, it's...
it's such a cliche.

01:08:20.638 --> 01:08:24.182
Young boy grows up
without a father,

01:08:24.183 --> 01:08:26.018
best friend steps in,

01:08:26.019 --> 01:08:31.231
plays Daddy and God
knows what else...

01:08:31.232 --> 01:08:39.232
I'm curious, did you see
your best friend's death?

01:08:39.657 --> 01:08:41.825
Could you have stopped it?

01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:44.953
Tod couldn't help him.

01:08:44.953 --> 01:08:48.207
Really?

01:08:51.002 --> 01:08:51.502
Tod?

01:08:56.174 --> 01:08:58.596
Is he dead because of you?

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:04.933
Tod...

01:09:13.232 --> 01:09:17.527
Say something!

01:09:17.528 --> 01:09:22.948
We were on patrol that night...

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:25.952
Uh huh.

01:09:25.953 --> 01:09:29.163
There was no moon,

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:35.337
we were scattered,
we were under fire.

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:43.337
I heard a thump...
it was a grenade...

01:09:43.888 --> 01:09:48.600
it went off and...

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:55.691
I opened fire in the direction
that I thought it came from.

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:59.986
You shot Mike?

01:09:59.987 --> 01:10:03.573
Yeah.

01:10:03.574 --> 01:10:06.243
You shot Mike?

01:10:06.244 --> 01:10:08.620
It was an accident.

01:10:08.621 --> 01:10:12.165
You killed Mike?

01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:18.171
All this time and
you killed Mike!

01:10:18.172 --> 01:10:21.267
Oh my God...

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:28.567
Well now you can get real...
and heal.

01:10:51.289 --> 01:10:52.164
I'm sorry.

01:10:52.165 --> 01:10:54.133
Don't...

01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:18.441
Stop, stop!

01:11:21.819 --> 01:11:22.694
He's coming to kill us.

01:11:22.695 --> 01:11:24.616
What are you talking about, kid?

01:11:24.617 --> 01:11:26.785
The secret agents, we
gotta get outta here!

01:11:26.786 --> 01:11:29.002
There's no secret agents
coming to kill you Pidge,

01:11:29.003 --> 01:11:30.786
now stop this!

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:32.289
I'm not getting involved
with you and your Mom

01:11:32.290 --> 01:11:35.254
and all the crazy things that
go on in that head of yours.

01:11:35.255 --> 01:11:36.087
No, no, please!

01:11:36.088 --> 01:11:37.209
You gotta believe me!

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:40.253
Please! Let go of my coat.

01:11:40.254 --> 01:11:41.505
Jump in and I'll give
you a ride home.

01:11:41.506 --> 01:11:42.464
Hey!

01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:44.174
Hey... whoa, whoa!

01:11:44.175 --> 01:11:46.134
Take us to the house, now.

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:47.385
Okay, don't shoot.

01:11:47.386 --> 01:11:49.605
Don't shoot Mister!

01:11:58.356 --> 01:12:00.575
Don't shoot.

01:12:02.527 --> 01:12:03.610
Go, move!

01:12:03.611 --> 01:12:04.402
Now!

01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:05.325
Just don't shoot.

01:12:05.326 --> 01:12:07.323
Put it in gear, let's go.

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:17.337
Do we have a line of sight?

01:12:17.338 --> 01:12:19.335
I'm checking.

01:12:48.281 --> 01:12:50.240
I'm sorry.

01:12:50.241 --> 01:12:55.495
We thought that you were a hero.

01:12:55.496 --> 01:12:56.788
I never said that.

01:12:56.789 --> 01:13:04.045
No you didn't, but you
made us believe it.

01:13:04.046 --> 01:13:07.391
And Pidge looks up to you...

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:18.362
You know that he said that he
wished you were his father?

01:13:49.216 --> 01:13:51.343
I still can't locate Tod.

01:13:51.344 --> 01:13:52.436
You think he's uh...

01:13:52.437 --> 01:13:56.473
You see him and he's got
booze on his breath,

01:13:56.474 --> 01:13:59.768
you tell him he's fired!

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:00.440
<i>God damnit...</i>

01:14:00.441 --> 01:14:02.859
okay...

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:18.206
What the hell's an electrician's
truck doing here?

01:14:18.207 --> 01:14:20.457
That's Judd Kelly, I told him
that the power went out.

01:14:20.458 --> 01:14:22.958
What else didn't you tell us?

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:25.553
Nothing.

01:14:27.588 --> 01:14:30.137
This little shit, I
flagged him down.

01:14:30.138 --> 01:14:31.091
Mom!

01:14:31.092 --> 01:14:33.385
Pidge!

01:14:33.386 --> 01:14:38.859
The boy went to Judd for
help, the electrical truck.

01:14:40.935 --> 01:14:43.353
Where's your store?

01:14:43.354 --> 01:14:44.312
Main street.

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:46.731
Who runs it?

01:14:46.732 --> 01:14:49.526
Just me.

01:14:49.527 --> 01:14:51.780
Alone?

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:56.449
Judd... just answer him.

01:14:56.450 --> 01:15:00.912
Yeah, alone.

01:15:00.913 --> 01:15:03.792
And you came here
to fix the power?

01:15:08.212 --> 01:15:10.431
Well fix it.

01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:15.144
I need my tools.

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:19.273
Let's go.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.188
Mom...

01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:28.031
Don't you hurt him.

01:15:28.032 --> 01:15:31.109
Don't you take him!

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:33.361
Pidge, you're gonna be fine!

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:35.740
No, Mom!

01:15:37.742 --> 01:15:39.409
Oh shit, shit, shit...

01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:41.083
Fuck!

01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:51.298
You make one sound,
I'll kill your mother.

01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:14.277
Oh Jesus...

01:16:14.278 --> 01:16:16.406
Never mind him!

01:16:25.706 --> 01:16:27.832
The problem's not here.

01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:28.458
What?

01:16:28.459 --> 01:16:29.506
What are you telling me?

01:16:29.507 --> 01:16:33.671
I need to see where the main
service comes into the house.

01:16:33.672 --> 01:16:36.800
Well, how do we do that?

01:16:36.801 --> 01:16:39.270
Go back upstairs.

01:16:43.682 --> 01:16:45.810
Keep going.

01:16:55.653 --> 01:16:59.578
You let Ellen and the boy go
and I'll get you outta here.

01:16:59.579 --> 01:17:01.407
Nice try.

01:17:01.408 --> 01:17:04.080
There's one road, it's
not gonna be blocked

01:17:04.081 --> 01:17:05.417
and I know where it is.

01:17:05.418 --> 01:17:06.709
You're useless to me.

01:17:06.710 --> 01:17:10.250
Then why don't you kill me?

01:17:10.251 --> 01:17:13.221
I will.

01:17:16.423 --> 01:17:18.471
You need to get dressed.

01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:31.020
Oh, this is a mess.

01:17:31.021 --> 01:17:33.399
Just fix the damn box!

01:17:37.361 --> 01:17:39.329
Barren!

01:17:41.073 --> 01:17:45.577
They're coming in from the west,
we need to change the plan.

01:17:45.578 --> 01:17:47.871
Hey, we gotta change the plan...

01:17:47.872 --> 01:17:50.500
Barren!

01:18:10.561 --> 01:18:15.565
Hey... I didn't sign
up to be a martyr.

01:18:15.566 --> 01:18:16.900
Trust me.

01:18:16.901 --> 01:18:17.609
Trust you?

01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:20.528
You keep pushing me
deeper in the comer!

01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:22.238
You have to trust me.

01:18:22.239 --> 01:18:25.163
You bought into this ideology,
you have to see it through.

01:18:25.164 --> 01:18:30.246
No, this is a one way ticket.

01:18:30.247 --> 01:18:33.091
Get the fucking power on, now.

01:18:38.214 --> 01:18:40.340
Hey, get us out of here
and I'll help you escape.

01:18:40.341 --> 01:18:41.433
Get us out and I'll
help you escape!

01:18:41.434 --> 01:18:43.393
Shut the fuck up!

01:18:45.596 --> 01:18:47.018
Hey, can you hang
onto this for me?

01:18:47.019 --> 01:18:49.267
I'm gonna have these
lights on in a second.

01:18:55.814 --> 01:18:56.736
What do you want me to do?

01:18:56.737 --> 01:18:58.484
Just like that.

01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:00.735
Got it?

01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:01.527
Yeah.

01:19:01.528 --> 01:19:03.530
Make it quick.

01:19:16.627 --> 01:19:18.461
Judd! Judd!

01:19:18.462 --> 01:19:19.796
Judd!

01:19:19.797 --> 01:19:21.256
You okay?

01:19:21.257 --> 01:19:22.474
Judd, bring a knife!

01:19:22.475 --> 01:19:25.718
Hurry, hurry.

01:19:25.719 --> 01:19:27.517
Good job, good job.

01:19:29.473 --> 01:19:32.392
Tod... Tod, be careful!

01:19:32.393 --> 01:19:33.268
I'll be right back.

01:19:33.269 --> 01:19:35.647
Go get Pidge, go get Pidge!

01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:46.748
You've gotta go get help.

01:19:46.749 --> 01:19:48.742
All right.

01:21:00.397 --> 01:21:02.857
Come here.

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:04.826
Careful...

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:19.499
Mister President,
welcome to Suddenly.

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.753
It's a great honor for
you to visit our town.

01:21:21.754 --> 01:21:24.130
It would be our
greatest privilege...

01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:57.921
Thank you very much.

01:21:59.665 --> 01:22:02.168
Now, I realize that 85
percent of you voted

01:22:02.169 --> 01:22:04.836
for the other guy... uh,

01:22:04.837 --> 01:22:08.637
I'm hoping to win you over
in these next few days.

01:22:56.763 --> 01:23:02.602
Pidge... shh, shh, it's okay.

01:23:02.603 --> 01:23:04.979
You okay?

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:08.608
It's okay, Pidge.

01:23:08.609 --> 01:23:10.111
It's okay.

01:23:28.921 --> 01:23:29.795
Go on.

01:23:29.796 --> 01:23:30.963
Pidge!

01:23:30.964 --> 01:23:33.717
It's okay.

01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:39.451
We have the latest update
on our top story tonight...

01:24:39.452 --> 01:24:41.870
it has been confirmed
that the gunman involved

01:24:41.871 --> 01:24:44.495
in the assassination attempt
on the president has no ties

01:24:44.496 --> 01:24:47.625
to domestic or international
terrorist organizations.

01:24:47.626 --> 01:24:50.339
Acting alone, the gunman
reportedly shot himself

01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:53.257
moments before he was
apprehended by officials.

01:24:53.258 --> 01:24:56.177
So far we can only speculate
on his motivations.

01:24:56.178 --> 01:24:58.139
This has been a wake
up call to the nation,

01:24:58.140 --> 01:24:59.603
and thankfully we're blessed

01:24:59.604 --> 01:25:05.728
that the president and his
family are healthy and safe.
