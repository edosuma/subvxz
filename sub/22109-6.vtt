D'oh!

01:38.766 --> 01:41.635
(organ playing upbeat version
of "The Simpsons Theme")

01:58.152 --> 01:59.587
This is Kent Brockman
on location

01:59.620 --> 02:01.622
among the good people
of Springfield.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.458
-(Kent groans)
-MAN: Coward!

02:04.492 --> 02:07.361
Because today, we celebrate
beautiful Skyline Park,

02:07.395 --> 02:09.029
a reclamation project
built atop the ruins

02:09.062 --> 02:11.432
of the Springfield Monorail.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.202
CROWD (chanting): Monorail.
Monorail. Monorail. Monorail.

02:14.235 --> 02:16.670
No, they're not building
a new monorail.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.672
Why not?
This one couldn't fail.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.274
(chanting):
Couldn't fail. Couldn't fail.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.443
(lisping):
* It's a monstrous creation *

02:22.476 --> 02:24.044
* Of mass transportation. *

02:24.077 --> 02:25.078
(gasps)

02:27.648 --> 02:30.218
RALPH:
Throw me again! (giggles)

02:30.251 --> 02:32.520
No, we're repurposing
the old monorail track

02:32.553 --> 02:34.622
into a completely new
and original feature

02:34.655 --> 02:36.123
we ripped off from New York:

02:36.156 --> 02:39.893
the Springfield Skypark-Line.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.329
I love this space.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.163
Planters, benches,

02:43.197 --> 02:46.834
solar-powered
talking trash cans.

02:46.867 --> 02:50.338
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Thank you for the used porn.

02:50.371 --> 02:51.972
(buzzer sounds)

02:52.005 --> 02:53.807
(Homer hums, grunts)

02:53.841 --> 02:56.076
Huh? (grunts)

02:56.109 --> 02:59.012
(grunts)

02:59.046 --> 03:01.048
Uh, okay, uh, do we go, uh,

03:01.081 --> 03:03.584
gut to gut or, uh,
butt-butt to nut?

03:03.617 --> 03:06.354
Don't worry,
we'll use the bypass board.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.490
Okay, fatsos, suck it in.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.724
-Oh!
-Whoa. (chuckles)

03:10.758 --> 03:12.159
(clothes squeaking)

03:12.192 --> 03:14.161
(grunts):
Oh!

03:14.194 --> 03:17.197
(chuckles)
I got Homer's sandwich.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.832
I got Wiggum's gun.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.101
And now, to culminate
today's events,

03:21.134 --> 03:22.703
let's turn on the electricity

03:22.736 --> 03:25.773
that illuminates
the tiny "no smoking" signs.

03:25.806 --> 03:26.807
(electricity buzzes)

03:30.944 --> 03:33.747
(electricity crackling)

03:37.418 --> 03:39.753
Huh? Somehow the track
is getting juice!

03:42.490 --> 03:44.825
Yes! Now to put it
on power save.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.396
The monorail-- it's alive!

03:48.429 --> 03:49.897
I warned you not to...

03:53.834 --> 03:55.569
(people screaming)

04:00.941 --> 04:02.343
Ha-ha!

04:04.011 --> 04:05.446
(Wilhelm scream)

04:10.017 --> 04:12.119
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Welcome, senior citizen.

04:12.152 --> 04:14.355
(people screaming)

04:20.361 --> 04:22.796
No more Nimoy!

04:26.867 --> 04:29.403
On the positive side,
with this disaster,

04:29.437 --> 04:32.005
we have surpassed
Detroit and Kabul

04:32.039 --> 04:34.074
as the world's
most unlucky city.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.743
Er, ah, er.

04:35.776 --> 04:39.680
Couldn't you have at least put
little wedges under the wheels?

04:39.713 --> 04:42.516
Er, uh, sorry, sweetheart,
but running a city is

04:42.550 --> 04:46.186
a little more complicated
than getting your nails done.

04:46.219 --> 04:48.088
-(annoyed groan)
-Don't you worry

04:48.121 --> 04:50.190
your pretty little head
about it.

04:50.223 --> 04:52.760
Mr. Mayor, that is so sexist.

04:52.793 --> 04:56.196
Uh-oh, sounds like
someone's girdle is pinching.

04:56.229 --> 04:58.198
(laughter)

04:58.231 --> 04:59.700
Well, now, it's all in fun.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.869
No one respects you ladies
more than I.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.204
Now if you wouldn't mind
serving the coffee and cake,

05:04.237 --> 05:06.206
we men can get down to business.

05:06.239 --> 05:07.508
(Marge mutters)

05:07.541 --> 05:09.510
This is the last time
I'm doing this.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.345
So I better do it perfectly.

05:11.379 --> 05:13.481
Here you go, Dr. Hibbert.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.849
-(knife chopping)
-(Marge grunting)

05:15.883 --> 05:18.952
I can't believe Mayor Quimby
talking down to me like that.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.722
And by the way, women don't
wear girdles anymore.

05:21.755 --> 05:24.392
We wear Spanx
and other shapewear.

05:24.425 --> 05:25.926
(scoffs) Tell me about it.

05:30.030 --> 05:34.067
People think we've moved on, but
this world is as sexist as ever.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.636
Thanks, Obama.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.571
What's so great
about Quimby anyway?

05:37.605 --> 05:38.972
I could cut a ribbon.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.574
And I could make it curl nicely

05:40.608 --> 05:42.910
using the edge
of the giant scissors.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.078
You'd be a great mayor, Mom.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.914
You're organized,
you manage the budget,

05:46.947 --> 05:50.250
and thanks to Dad, you're
an expert on the court system.

05:50.283 --> 05:52.753
Fun fact: being a defendant
gets you out of jury duty.

05:52.786 --> 05:53.754
(chuckles)

05:53.787 --> 05:56.089
Mom, this is our time.

05:56.123 --> 05:58.158
Wonder Woman showed
that if you're a goddess

05:58.191 --> 06:01.395
with superpowers, there's
no limit to what you can do.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.363
You could be mayor!

06:03.397 --> 06:04.765
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:04.798 --> 06:07.167
A woman prime minister, okay.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.102
Women Ghostbusters, cool.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.738
Woman head of
the Federal Reserve,

06:10.771 --> 06:12.906
as far as I'm concerned,
what's that?

06:12.940 --> 06:14.408
But a woman mayor?

06:14.442 --> 06:17.945
If Mom becomes mayor,
we can get away with anything.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.647
(hip-hop music plays)

06:21.148 --> 06:23.083
Help me, Jesus!

06:23.116 --> 06:25.118
(heavenly choir singing)

06:28.656 --> 06:30.691
Pick a side.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.460
(wind whistles)

06:32.493 --> 06:34.862
(hip-hop music plays)

06:34.895 --> 06:36.296
(laughs)

06:36.329 --> 06:38.265
Hey. Where'd everybody go?

06:38.298 --> 06:41.469
JULIO: Marge, this town
is ready for a change.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.737
Quimby has been mayor,
like, forever.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.573
You'd think he could
lose that sash.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.641
It's like, we know, okay?

06:47.675 --> 06:48.976
All right now, listen.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.078
The key to victory
is micro-targeting.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.446
Micro-targeting.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.548
Think of the voters as a pie.

06:54.582 --> 06:55.883
(phone rings)

06:55.916 --> 06:58.151
Yes, Homer,
someone here said "pie."

06:58.185 --> 06:59.820
I know, "Mmm, pie."

06:59.853 --> 07:01.321
(drooling moan)

07:01.354 --> 07:02.756
I'm sorry, go on.

07:02.790 --> 07:06.494
Uh, we use data analysis
to divide the pie

07:06.527 --> 07:08.161
into tiny little slivers

07:08.195 --> 07:10.631
and tailor a message
to each micro-group.

07:10.664 --> 07:11.999
(clears throat)

07:12.032 --> 07:15.168
You just tell them what they
want to hear until you get 51%.

07:15.202 --> 07:18.171
Then you can govern
like a far-right nut-job.

07:18.205 --> 07:21.509
MARGE (to "Oh! Susanna"):
* I'm Marge Simpson *

07:21.542 --> 07:23.844
* And won't you vote for me? *

07:23.877 --> 07:26.514
* Whatever your obsession is *

07:26.547 --> 07:29.016
* Is my priority. *

07:29.049 --> 07:32.520
I stand with you
against revenuers.

07:32.553 --> 07:35.188
Oh, uh, durn revenuers!

07:35.222 --> 07:37.858
Well, you's the new John Galt,
aren't you?

07:37.891 --> 07:41.962
Hey, can you take a picture
with our Ayn Rand scarecrow?

07:42.963 --> 07:45.165
(cawing)

07:45.198 --> 07:48.368
CHORUS: * From widows
to your lunch pail Joes *

07:48.401 --> 07:50.871
* To vets of foreign wars *

07:50.904 --> 07:53.140
* There's no
single-issue voter *

07:53.173 --> 07:55.943
* My campaign will ignore. *

07:55.976 --> 07:58.145
Marge, we really
appreciate this.

07:58.178 --> 08:01.014
You're the first politician
that's ever met with us weirdos.

08:01.048 --> 08:04.552
What's the biggest issue
you exotic pet owners face?

08:04.585 --> 08:06.654
Keeping our pets
from eating each other.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.189
Yes. As the owner
of an impala, I...

08:09.222 --> 08:11.625
-Hey, where'd it go?
-Oh, boy.

08:11.659 --> 08:14.895
* From soccer moms
to mafia dons *

08:14.928 --> 08:17.698
* I'll give you what you need *

08:17.731 --> 08:20.000
MARGE and CHORUS:
* I'm Marge Simpson *

08:20.033 --> 08:22.770
* And won't you vote for me?
Yeah! *

08:23.837 --> 08:25.906
Why do people assume
all I can do

08:25.939 --> 08:29.009
is feed spaghetti to dogs
that want to make out?

08:29.042 --> 08:30.343
What do you want to do?

08:30.377 --> 08:33.246
Carve a little wooden boy
and make him come to life.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.314
Oh.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.349
-(Homer humming)
-*

08:42.790 --> 08:45.158
Now, for our third and fourth
party candidates,

08:45.192 --> 08:48.596
I regret to say you are just shy
of the polling results required,

08:48.629 --> 08:50.430
so you're excluded
from the debate.

08:50.463 --> 08:52.332
Bye-bye.

08:52.365 --> 08:55.068
Mrs. Simpson, you've targeted
small constituencies.

08:55.102 --> 08:57.070
Do you have any proposals
that would appeal

08:57.104 --> 08:58.872
to every Springfielder?

09:00.540 --> 09:02.275
Well, Kent, I am a mom.

09:02.309 --> 09:06.947
And as a mom, I want to help
this town eat its vegetables.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.548
(angry murmuring)

09:08.582 --> 09:10.618
(chuckles)
Vegetables, Marge?

09:10.651 --> 09:12.620
As moderator,
it's my duty to fact check

09:12.653 --> 09:14.387
that many of them are yucky.

09:14.421 --> 09:15.956
It's a metaphor.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.457
Stinkin' metaphors!

09:17.490 --> 09:19.426
I only trust similes.

09:19.459 --> 09:20.928
I enjoy metaphors.

09:20.961 --> 09:23.430
They're raindrops on the flower
that is the ear.

09:23.463 --> 09:25.298
You put in a "like" or an "as,"

09:25.332 --> 09:27.434
or so help me
you are going down.

09:30.337 --> 09:31.972
HELEN:
She's completely cooked.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.574
Unlike the chicken
she brought to the potluck.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.877
LOVEJOY: Oh, Helen is
as bitter as the lemonade

09:36.910 --> 09:38.311
she brought to the potluck.

09:38.345 --> 09:41.414
What a terrible potluck
that was.

09:41.448 --> 09:43.951
SIDESHOW MEL: Why wasn't this
a town hall event?

09:43.984 --> 09:46.854
I like to see them
balance on the stools.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.826
You know, my entire life,

09:52.860 --> 09:55.495
that stupid tire fire
has been burning.

09:55.528 --> 09:57.397
And it's ruined our town.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.067
(murmurs of agreement)

10:00.100 --> 10:02.302
I promise, if you elect me,

10:02.335 --> 10:04.237
I'll put that fire out.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.907
(excited chatter)

10:06.940 --> 10:08.141
No tire fire?

10:08.175 --> 10:09.843
Ooh, just like Zurich.

10:09.877 --> 10:10.978
-Mm.
-Mm.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.015
(bell dinging)

10:15.048 --> 10:16.583
FRINK (singsongy):
Mm-hmm!

10:16.616 --> 10:17.751
Is that enough?

10:17.785 --> 10:19.853
And with the last senior citizen
gently reminded

10:19.887 --> 10:23.190
that they cannot vote at IHOP,
the results are now final.

10:23.223 --> 10:24.524
History is made.

10:24.557 --> 10:26.493
Marge Simpson is our new mayor.

10:26.526 --> 10:30.030
The first woman and the second
to pee sitting down.

10:30.063 --> 10:32.365
CROWD (chanting):
Marge! Marge! Marge!

10:32.399 --> 10:33.901
Thank you.

10:35.068 --> 10:38.138
Homie, you want to make out
with the mayor?

10:38.171 --> 10:40.708
What? No! Ew!

10:40.741 --> 10:42.876
Oh, you mean you.

10:42.910 --> 10:45.879
(both laughing)

10:45.913 --> 10:47.047
Okay.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.581
Now I really wish I'd voted.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.853
*

10:56.757 --> 10:59.226
Whee! Whee!

10:59.259 --> 11:01.661
Look at me!
I'm a public servant!

11:01.695 --> 11:03.063
Woo-hoo!

11:03.096 --> 11:06.233
KENT: And so our new mayor
is doing what was unthinkable

11:06.266 --> 11:08.802
in the Quimby regime: something.

11:08.836 --> 11:11.104
Roll the 'dozers!

11:13.273 --> 11:15.108
(crowd cheering)

11:18.111 --> 11:19.079
(crowd gasps)

11:19.112 --> 11:20.914
Well, sorry,

11:20.948 --> 11:24.384
but I-I can't let you
put me out of business.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.086
(chuckles)

11:26.119 --> 11:30.924
You'd ruin the air for the whole
town just to sell knickknacks?

11:30.958 --> 11:32.092
Knickknacks?

11:32.125 --> 11:33.894
They-they may be to you,

11:33.927 --> 11:37.064
but, uh, they put my son
through med school.

11:37.097 --> 11:40.167
He named, um, uh,
a-a stammer after me.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.669
(stammers)

11:42.702 --> 11:43.837
You know.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.605
(crowd aahs)

11:45.638 --> 11:46.774
I failed.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.876
I failed on my one promise.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.344
(sighs): Oh.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.613
And so, Marge Simpson
is already a failure.

11:53.646 --> 11:56.383
The fastest fall from grace
since Mamie Eisenhower

11:56.416 --> 11:59.152
destroyed a piano store
on inauguration day.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.591
Hey, Mom,
want to get some lunch?

12:04.624 --> 12:06.193
I'd love a lunch break,

12:06.226 --> 12:09.296
but I've got to get
that tire fire out first.

12:09.329 --> 12:12.365
Already neglecting your family,
Madam Mayor?

12:12.399 --> 12:14.902
Why you little!
Don't embarrass your mother!

12:16.736 --> 12:18.772
(Homer and Bart grunting)

12:18.806 --> 12:20.607
(laughs)

12:25.145 --> 12:28.481
(both laughing)

12:31.151 --> 12:32.752
Guys, guys, stop!

12:32.786 --> 12:33.921
I'm the mayor.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.989
Everything you do
reflects on me.

12:36.023 --> 12:37.324
Of course, honey.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.159
It's just hard
to restrain yourself

12:39.192 --> 12:40.828
when you're above the law.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.662
We're not above the law.

12:42.695 --> 12:45.232
Oh, yeah, yeah, I get it.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.234
Hmm?

12:47.267 --> 12:48.668
I want you to promise me.

12:48.701 --> 12:52.172
Can you both behave like Lisa,
just for a little bit?

12:52.205 --> 12:55.608
BOTH (high-pitched):
"I'm Lisa. I'm Lisa."

12:55.642 --> 12:57.610
"I like music."

12:57.644 --> 13:00.247
"My boyfriend is broccoli."

13:00.280 --> 13:01.414
(kissing noises)

13:01.448 --> 13:02.582
Hey!

13:02.615 --> 13:05.185
We're here to buy your stand.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.520
Yeah, well, it's not for sale.

13:07.554 --> 13:10.257
(groans) All I want to do
is help this city,

13:10.290 --> 13:12.759
and I can't because of
this ding-dong.

13:12.792 --> 13:13.793
(crowd gasps)

13:13.827 --> 13:16.363
How dare you
insult me like that?

13:16.396 --> 13:17.697
I was there!

13:17.730 --> 13:20.133
What? What, what,
what, what, what?

13:20.167 --> 13:21.835
Clyde's a Vietnam vet,

13:21.869 --> 13:24.204
a survivor of
the Battle of Dhing Dhong.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.305
Thank you.

13:25.338 --> 13:27.174
Than Kyu was his best friend.

13:27.207 --> 13:30.010
Stepped on a land mine in
the battle of One Pun Too Many.

13:30.043 --> 13:32.212
This is not good, Marge.
Not good.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.713
(sighs): Oh.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.883
Marge's beehive of activity
has become

13:35.916 --> 13:37.684
a hornet's nest of trouble.

13:37.717 --> 13:40.553
Also, our news broadcasts have
been reduced to two sentences.

13:40.587 --> 13:41.721
Good night.

13:41.754 --> 13:43.056
There's only one way out.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.624
You're gonna have to do a live,

13:44.657 --> 13:47.160
completely unscripted
heart-to-heart with the voters.

13:47.194 --> 13:49.496
-Here's your script.
-I don't want a script.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.763
Are you nuts?

13:52.165 --> 13:53.200
Good evening.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.735
I'm here to talk to you,
one-on-one,

13:55.768 --> 13:58.939
just an ordinary mom
sitting in her kitchen.

14:00.607 --> 14:01.909
This is a disaster.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.977
I've seen counterclockwise
knob turning before,

14:04.011 --> 14:05.345
but not like this.

14:07.014 --> 14:09.382
Marge, what time
is dinner ready?

14:09.416 --> 14:11.351
I'm in the middle of a speech.

14:11.384 --> 14:12.852
So, 6:00?

14:12.886 --> 14:14.487
You'll get it when you get it.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.924
Wait a minute.
Something's turning them around.

14:16.957 --> 14:20.427
Marge, can you cook
a Hot Pocket in the dryer?

14:20.460 --> 14:22.395
(groans) Homer Simpson,

14:22.429 --> 14:25.665
the only time you shut your
mouth is to keep food inside.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.600
(gasps, stammers)

14:27.634 --> 14:30.270
(laughter)

14:30.303 --> 14:31.338
That's it.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.940
She's turned
a gaffe-making tubby

14:32.973 --> 14:34.374
into a laugh-yielding hubby.

14:34.407 --> 14:35.943
Does that work?

14:35.976 --> 14:37.945
FRINK (mumbles): Let's see,
the subter-hand is all right.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.113
The math checks out.

14:40.147 --> 14:42.249
I'll be the Kellyanne Conway
of this thing.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.550
Kellyanne Conway?

14:43.583 --> 14:46.053
I like how she always
looks like she just woke up.

14:46.086 --> 14:50.123
I think it's inspiring how now
a woman can be Joseph Goebbels.

14:50.157 --> 14:52.625
(murmurs of agreement)

14:54.161 --> 14:55.795
Marge, do we have any bread?

14:55.828 --> 14:57.130
Check your chest.

14:57.164 --> 14:59.632
(laughter)

14:59.666 --> 15:01.468
Woo-hoo!

15:01.501 --> 15:02.635
Oh, my God.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.137
Those are the highest
approval ratings

15:04.171 --> 15:07.174
I've ever seen
for an incumbent: 53%!

15:08.641 --> 15:10.643
*

15:14.814 --> 15:16.749
Marge, your numbers
are simply fantastic.

15:16.783 --> 15:19.686
And all you had to do was throw
your husband under the bus.

15:20.787 --> 15:22.089
Well, don't tell me you're sad

15:22.122 --> 15:23.756
about throwing your husband
under the bus.

15:23.790 --> 15:26.259
I'm happy if he can
fit under a bus.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.427
Zing!

15:27.460 --> 15:30.030
Yeah. (chuckles) Zing.

15:31.764 --> 15:35.402
Mr. Simpson, we're naming
a sandwich after you.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.904
(gasps) My lifelong dream
has come true.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.339
I've got this all planned.

15:39.372 --> 15:42.142
Start with a full Reuben
with all the fixin's.

15:42.175 --> 15:43.910
Put a club sandwich on top.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.912
The bottom bun
is, at first glance,

15:45.945 --> 15:47.981
a chicken-fried steak.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.849
But it's worth a closer look,
because...

15:49.882 --> 15:52.419
Sir, sir, sir.
We've already made it.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.922
The Open-Mouthed
Turkey Goofball?

15:55.955 --> 15:58.425
That is so not me.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.527
But I'll take six.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.196
We're honored to have
with us the mayor...

16:03.230 --> 16:04.964
(crowd cheering)

16:04.998 --> 16:07.700
...and First Doofus
Homer Simpson.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.302
(laughter)

16:09.336 --> 16:13.840
Homer's made Marge happy more
times than he can count: three!

16:13.873 --> 16:15.208
(Marge chuckles)

16:15.242 --> 16:18.045
And we're here for
a very, very serious charity:

16:18.078 --> 16:19.546
Save the Whales.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.681
All right, that's it!

16:21.714 --> 16:23.983
No. That's really
why we're here!

16:24.017 --> 16:25.985
(Krusty sobs)

16:26.019 --> 16:27.187
I am not a whale!

16:27.220 --> 16:30.557
I am a man with blubber
and several harpoon scars!

16:32.192 --> 16:33.160
(Homer screams)

16:33.193 --> 16:35.195
(whale-like groaning)

16:40.233 --> 16:42.535
(concerned groan)

16:42.569 --> 16:44.871
What a day for this town.

16:44.904 --> 16:47.840
We've made a deal
with the librarians' union.

16:47.874 --> 16:48.875
Shh.

16:48.908 --> 16:50.043
Homer would've been here,

16:50.077 --> 16:51.978
but he backed out
when he heard the library

16:52.011 --> 16:53.713
didn't have any pop-up books.

16:53.746 --> 16:56.249
(laughter)

16:57.784 --> 16:59.786
(crowd cheering)

17:04.257 --> 17:06.226
Great news, Marge.
You've tapped into something

17:06.259 --> 17:09.862
women and men can agree on:
husbands are idiots.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.231
Yeah, I guess.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.865
While you're guessing,
I'm running with this.

17:12.899 --> 17:14.567
Take a look at
the balloon we've made

17:14.601 --> 17:15.868
for the Thanksgiving parade.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.272
I don't care what people say.

17:19.306 --> 17:22.542
My Homie makes one sexy blimp.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.813
I need to talk to somebody.

17:33.953 --> 17:35.122
Mayor Quimby?

17:35.155 --> 17:38.425
No, just ordinary Diamond Joe.

17:38.458 --> 17:39.926
Uh-oh, I know that look.

17:39.959 --> 17:43.096
That's a mayor on the ropes
or a wife who wants a divorce.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.564
I'm familiar with both.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.065
Er, uh, indeed.

17:46.099 --> 17:49.769
Joe, is it possible to have
a decent family life

17:49.802 --> 17:51.904
and be a good political leader?

17:51.938 --> 17:54.107
Marge, I don't want
to talk about that anymore,

17:54.141 --> 17:57.110
but I'll tell you this:
retirement agrees with me.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.611
The first night out of office,

17:58.645 --> 18:01.114
I noticed a gorgeous woman
lying next to me,

18:01.148 --> 18:04.284
and I said, "Holy crap,
I'm married to her."

18:04.317 --> 18:06.286
Go long, boys. (grunts)

18:06.319 --> 18:09.322
BOTH (seal-like barking):
Er, ah, er, ah, er, ah, er...

18:11.324 --> 18:14.494
Marge, there's no "mayor"
in marriage.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.629
There almost is.
It's really close.

18:16.663 --> 18:17.964
But I'm afraid not.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.132
(grunts, chuckles)

18:19.166 --> 18:20.433
Meet you in the boathouse later?

18:20.467 --> 18:21.434
(chuckles)

18:21.468 --> 18:23.436
Oh, Marge, I want to thank you

18:23.470 --> 18:25.172
for giving me back my Joseph.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.306
Will you stay?

18:26.339 --> 18:28.575
I just made a giant pitcher
of gimlets,

18:28.608 --> 18:30.843
but I can make a second one
if you're staying.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.412
No, I have to get back.

18:32.445 --> 18:35.782
We're christening a new
manhole cover on 4th Street.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.284
(gulping)

18:37.317 --> 18:38.285
So sad.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.652
Can't you stay for a bit?

18:39.686 --> 18:42.655
Uh, we need some help
serving coffee and cake.

18:42.689 --> 18:45.425
I swear this is the last time.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.460
There's more
where that came from!

18:50.330 --> 18:53.666
Thank you. I couldn't be here
without my husband.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.635
(laughter)

18:55.668 --> 18:57.504
He's a big supporter.

18:57.537 --> 18:58.971
So big...

18:59.005 --> 19:00.540
(laughter)

19:05.245 --> 19:07.046
(groans)

19:10.583 --> 19:13.386
So big, I wish all of you could

19:13.420 --> 19:15.388
know the love in his heart.

19:15.422 --> 19:16.656
(crowd gasps)

19:16.689 --> 19:18.525
Everyone, look inside yourself

19:18.558 --> 19:21.828
and find your Homer Simpson.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.730
BOTH:
Mwah!

19:26.233 --> 19:28.368
(crowd murmuring)

19:30.737 --> 19:33.740
(gasps) It's so beautiful.

19:36.276 --> 19:38.778
We make the magic happen, baby.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.790
*

19:59.866 --> 20:01.167
Can we just skip that one?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.236
I would, but you have
to walk through it

20:03.270 --> 20:04.737
to get to the cafeteria.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.439
Oh. Okay.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.524
Shh!
