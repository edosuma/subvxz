WEBVTT

00:00.274 --> 00:03.570
(dramatic upbeat music)

00:03.570 --> 00:06.510
- I'm checking into a
very unusual occasion.

00:06.510 --> 00:10.640
A castle in the middle of
Ohio, run by a mother and son.

00:10.640 --> 00:12.220
- You know, you get a little overwhelmed

00:12.220 --> 00:14.600
and you don't know how to proceed.

00:14.600 --> 00:16.650
- She takes on all the responsibility.

00:16.650 --> 00:17.780
Have you ever told anyone,

00:17.780 --> 00:19.380
how much stress is on your shoulders?

00:19.380 --> 00:20.980
- No, I pretty much keep it in.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.670
- [Gordon] And he
doesn't know how to help.

00:22.670 --> 00:24.100
- I can't tell you business-wise,

00:24.100 --> 00:25.960
if Jimmy really has any
strengths at this point.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.360
- If I can't get through to him,

00:27.360 --> 00:29.740
this hotel will be in serious jeopardy.

00:29.740 --> 00:32.140
Surely, you must know
that this is not right.

00:32.140 --> 00:33.697
- No, it isn't.

00:33.697 --> 00:36.947
(tense dramatic music)

00:37.785 --> 00:40.952
(lively upbeat music)

00:45.110 --> 00:47.760
- Located along the black
fork of the Mohican River,

00:47.760 --> 00:49.860
is a small town of Loudonville.

00:49.860 --> 00:51.853
Home to Landoll's Mohican Castle.

00:53.980 --> 00:56.410
After selling their
profitable printing business,

00:56.410 --> 00:58.920
owners Jim and Marta
Landoll, built the castle

00:58.920 --> 01:03.750
on a lush 1100 acre estate
in the heart of rural Ohio.

01:03.750 --> 01:07.220
- Jim and I ran a colouring
book publishing business.

01:07.220 --> 01:11.160
We did sell it, I assumed we would retire,

01:11.160 --> 01:14.560
but Jim had other ideas. (chuckles)

01:14.560 --> 01:17.640
- My dad told himself that if he ever made

01:17.640 --> 01:20.700
any kind of money someday
he would build a castle.

01:20.700 --> 01:25.160
And he made money and he built a castle.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.810
Between the castle and restaurant,

01:26.810 --> 01:29.863
the official total was
in the $6 million range.

01:29.863 --> 01:33.113
(gentle pensive music)

01:34.090 --> 01:39.090
- In 2008, our beautiful
restaurant burned to the ground.

01:39.437 --> 01:42.520
(gentle piano music)

01:43.480 --> 01:46.800
My husband, he had let
the insurance lapse.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.213
Unfortunately, it was
only four days prior.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.243
It was a really bad day.

01:56.210 --> 01:59.730
We burned down in May and
Jim and I separated in June.

01:59.730 --> 02:02.150
We were divorced within the year.

02:02.150 --> 02:06.833
Jim retired, and now
it's all on my shoulders.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.690
- Marta does everything here.

02:09.690 --> 02:11.940
She works, oh, my gosh,
harder than anybody

02:11.940 --> 02:13.700
I think on the property.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.230
- She runs around like crazy.

02:16.230 --> 02:18.770
There's not a day that she's not working

02:18.770 --> 02:20.930
from sunup until sundown.

02:20.930 --> 02:22.100
She could be retired.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.860
She could be relaxing somewhere
enjoying her grandkids,

02:24.860 --> 02:27.880
but instead it's almost
like she's a prisoner here.

02:27.880 --> 02:32.880
So I think that we really need
Jimmy to manage the property.

02:33.240 --> 02:36.720
- Jimmy, is the General
Manager in title only.

02:36.720 --> 02:38.340
He's more of the cook
here on the property.

02:38.340 --> 02:41.510
- It says two or one
tablespoon of worcester

02:42.480 --> 02:43.390
or whatever you call it.

02:43.390 --> 02:45.330
- We don't really honestly
take him seriously.

02:45.330 --> 02:48.410
But we've never had a reason to,

02:48.410 --> 02:50.480
I guess, take him seriously.

02:50.480 --> 02:52.330
- Are we supposed to clean up now?

02:52.330 --> 02:53.520
- Because he's the baby born

02:53.520 --> 02:54.860
with a silver spoon in his mouth

02:54.860 --> 02:57.460
that everybody's always
done everything for him.

02:57.460 --> 02:58.370
- What is honey-glazed carrots?

02:58.370 --> 02:59.820
I've actually never made those.

02:59.820 --> 03:01.430
- Marta does baby Jimmy.

03:01.430 --> 03:04.080
And that causes Jimmy to
not really have to step up

03:04.080 --> 03:05.373
and be a General Manager.

03:06.710 --> 03:09.070
(dramatic upbeat music)

03:09.070 --> 03:11.860
- We keep thinking, what can we do?

03:11.860 --> 03:15.273
What can we do to get more
customers in the restaurant?

03:15.273 --> 03:18.400
What can we do to get
more people at the hotel?

03:18.400 --> 03:19.763
It has such potential.

03:21.580 --> 03:25.760
- One of my main concerns is
that I do want to be able to

03:25.760 --> 03:29.960
make this place successful
and be able to retire.

03:29.960 --> 03:33.590
But it is a struggle
because a lot of times

03:33.590 --> 03:36.083
I don't see a lot of light
at the end of the tunnel.

03:39.791 --> 03:42.958
(lively upbeat music)

03:45.390 --> 03:46.920
- I'm here in Ohio.

03:46.920 --> 03:49.500
I'm heading to a castle.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.050
That's right, a castle.

03:51.050 --> 03:53.130
But it's actually built
by local businessman.

03:53.130 --> 03:55.220
He's no longer involved
and he's left the property

03:55.220 --> 03:57.243
to his ex wife and his son to run.

03:58.493 --> 03:59.340
Here we are.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.910
Castle up ahead, look at that.

04:01.910 --> 04:04.333
Wow! The grounds are stunning.

04:05.239 --> 04:08.760
OMG! Look at this place.

04:08.760 --> 04:11.793
What an amazing setting, really beautiful.

04:14.520 --> 04:15.780
Hello.
- [Crystal] Hello.

04:15.780 --> 04:17.099
- My goodness me.

04:17.099 --> 04:17.932
(Crystal chuckles)

04:17.932 --> 04:18.851
Gordon, nice to see you.

04:18.851 --> 04:20.410
- Crystal, nice to meet you.

04:20.410 --> 04:21.279
- This place is incredible.

04:21.279 --> 04:23.070
When was it built?

04:23.070 --> 04:25.750
- They started construction
in 1996, we opened in 2002.

04:25.750 --> 04:26.840
- Wow, how long have you been here?

04:26.840 --> 04:27.910
- I've been here for 10 years.

04:27.910 --> 04:30.530
- And all this is sort of junk.

04:30.530 --> 04:31.610
What happens to that stuff?

04:31.610 --> 04:32.820
- [Crystal] This is our little gift shop.

04:32.820 --> 04:33.653
- [Gordon] Oh, wow.
- [Crystal] Yeah.

04:33.653 --> 04:35.350
- So this is a gift shop.

04:35.350 --> 04:36.781
Bits of sort of knickknacks and-

04:36.781 --> 04:38.986
- There's little, yeah, odd. (chuckles)

04:38.986 --> 04:39.970
- But they seem odd.

04:39.970 --> 04:40.810
What about these?

04:40.810 --> 04:43.850
- (chuckles) I haven't sold
any of the reading sunglasses.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.660
- [Gordon] And what's that?

04:45.660 --> 04:48.110
- [Crystal] That is the
CD we have in our rooms.

04:48.110 --> 04:50.500
- The CD? The Celtic mystic?

04:50.500 --> 04:52.270
- We have music playing in
our suites when you arrive.

04:52.270 --> 04:54.663
- Wow, I didn't know
people buy CDs anymore.

04:54.663 --> 04:55.890
(Crystal laughs)

04:55.890 --> 04:57.040
Wow, 16...

04:57.040 --> 04:58.610
Is it good?

04:58.610 --> 05:00.720
- I've listened to it for 10 years.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.770
I don't hear it anymore most of the time.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.300
- What a strange little knickknack shop.

05:04.300 --> 05:06.157
And what's over here?

05:06.157 --> 05:07.860
- All the beer and wine that we sell.

05:07.860 --> 05:10.817
- Wow, you can see the
dust on top of there.

05:10.817 --> 05:12.580
Everything's so dusty.

05:12.580 --> 05:13.800
Who's in charge of cleaning.

05:13.800 --> 05:15.470
- I'm slacking on my job.

05:15.470 --> 05:17.120
- I appreciate the odd speckle of dust

05:17.120 --> 05:18.260
on the wine in the wine cellar,

05:18.260 --> 05:19.400
but not like this.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.489
Wow, and look at that.

05:20.489 --> 05:22.631
When is that from? 1980 what?

05:22.631 --> 05:23.464
(Crystal laughs)

05:23.464 --> 05:25.560
You laugh, but it is a
little out of date, right?

05:25.560 --> 05:27.670
- Oh, yeah, definitely
out of date and dusty.

05:27.670 --> 05:29.225
- Dusty? Actually if the TV was on

05:29.225 --> 05:31.670
you couldn't see it cause of the dust.

05:31.670 --> 05:34.975
So it looks like it was high-end
to build, really expensive.

05:34.975 --> 05:35.808
- Yes.

05:35.808 --> 05:37.750
- It doesn't look like
we've had enough money

05:37.750 --> 05:40.160
go back into it to keep it sort of-

05:40.160 --> 05:42.014
- Where it needs to be.
- Yeah, where it needs-

05:42.014 --> 05:43.320
- And how it should be, right.

05:43.320 --> 05:45.497
- And what's over here?

05:45.497 --> 05:47.330
- One of the weddings
we had on the property.

05:47.330 --> 05:48.230
- [Gordon] This place must be packed.

05:48.230 --> 05:49.670
- [Crystal] They do 30 to 50 a year.

05:49.670 --> 05:50.630
- [Gordon] Who runs those?

05:50.630 --> 05:52.400
- Melody, is our events coordinator.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.900
- And she's a specialist in events?

05:54.900 --> 05:56.540
- She was never like
trained or anything but she-

05:56.540 --> 06:00.070
- How can you run events
if you're not trained?

06:00.070 --> 06:01.973
- Common sense sometimes prevails.

06:02.820 --> 06:03.960
- Now what's that there?

06:03.960 --> 06:06.990
Landoll's Mohican Castle,
win a night's stay.

06:06.990 --> 06:07.823
- Stop.

06:07.823 --> 06:09.170
- You know, many people wanna free night?

06:09.170 --> 06:10.870
- Seriously?
- Seriously, yeah.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.180
We try to do it once a month.

06:12.180 --> 06:13.013
- Shall I do one?

06:13.013 --> 06:13.846
- Yes, please.

06:17.480 --> 06:19.250
- Love this. Love it.

06:19.250 --> 06:20.670
Ready? So...

06:22.053 --> 06:23.010
- All right.

06:23.010 --> 06:24.540
- That's fantastic.

06:24.540 --> 06:26.140
Is there a cell number on there?

06:27.940 --> 06:29.300
Thank you.

06:29.300 --> 06:30.640
Answering machine.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.900
Chuck, congratulations.

06:32.900 --> 06:34.920
You have won yourself a free night's stay

06:34.920 --> 06:39.920
at Landoll's Mohican Castle,
courtesy of me, Gordon Ramsay.

06:40.440 --> 06:41.670
Free dinner?

06:41.670 --> 06:42.810
- [Crystal] Dinner's not included, no.

06:42.810 --> 06:44.830
- Chuck, I'm so sorry. I don't
want to piss on your bonfire,

06:44.830 --> 06:46.450
but there's no dinner involved.

06:46.450 --> 06:48.260
But I'll pay for dinner, Chuck.

06:48.260 --> 06:49.790
Best wishes.

06:49.790 --> 06:51.850
He's gonna be so happy when
he hears that fucking message.

06:51.850 --> 06:52.803
- Yes, he is.
- There we go.

06:52.803 --> 06:53.636
- He's gonna be floored.

06:53.636 --> 06:54.469
- Excellent.

06:55.880 --> 06:59.200
Amazing mess, there is
clutter, there is dusty.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.530
So you've been here 10
years? What are the problems?

07:01.530 --> 07:03.610
- Just little things here and
there that need to be updated.

07:03.610 --> 07:05.610
Most of it's still from
when we opened originally,

07:05.610 --> 07:07.260
so 13 years old.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.450
- Now, the owner is no longer
involved with the business.

07:10.450 --> 07:12.050
He's left it to his ex-wife.

07:12.050 --> 07:13.600
- Marta, Jim's ex-wife.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.130
- Right, she runs it now with her son

07:15.130 --> 07:16.430
who's the General Manager?

07:16.430 --> 07:17.263
- Correct.

07:17.263 --> 07:18.883
- Right, and what's his strengths?

07:20.250 --> 07:22.270
- I can't tell you
business-wise, management-wise

07:22.270 --> 07:23.350
if Jimmy really, in my opinion,

07:23.350 --> 07:24.960
has any strengths at this point.

07:24.960 --> 07:26.650
He has the title "General Manager"

07:26.650 --> 07:28.010
but I don't think he really fully

07:28.010 --> 07:29.565
has that role of General Manager yet.

07:29.565 --> 07:31.640
- And he went off to
train at hotel school.

07:31.640 --> 07:32.490
Where did he come from?

07:32.490 --> 07:34.920
- No. Jimmy, has no training
outside of high school.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.270
- [Gordon] Marta? Does she?

07:37.250 --> 07:38.110
- [Crystal] No.

07:38.110 --> 07:40.600
- She has no training, he has no training.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.010
Who's more hands-on?

07:42.010 --> 07:43.150
- Marta is hands-on.

07:43.150 --> 07:44.900
Marta is here, there, and everywhere.

07:44.900 --> 07:48.530
And she's like the busy
bee that never stops.

07:48.530 --> 07:50.150
- Is she around?

07:50.150 --> 07:51.880
- I'm sure she's on the property, let me.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.330
- Thank you.

07:53.330 --> 07:55.150
I'm gonna just check around outside.

07:55.150 --> 07:58.410
And I look forward to
seeing Marta, thank you.

07:58.410 --> 07:59.620
- You're welcome.

07:59.620 --> 08:01.020
Hey, is Marta down there?

08:01.020 --> 08:02.840
- Wow! This place cost a fortune.

08:02.840 --> 08:04.130
What is up here?

08:04.130 --> 08:05.180
- Okay, can you send her up.

08:05.180 --> 08:06.723
Gordon, would like to meet her.

08:06.723 --> 08:08.390
- Look at that, wow!

08:09.741 --> 08:12.553
What in the fuck is that over there?

08:12.553 --> 08:14.170
Is that a T-Rex?

08:14.170 --> 08:15.120
What is that thing?

08:18.715 --> 08:21.132
Ugh, look at all these flies.

08:23.650 --> 08:26.253
Bloody hell, look at that.

08:27.580 --> 08:30.989
So you relax and take
your cigarette breaks.

08:30.989 --> 08:35.270
Ugh, Jesus Christ, look
at all these flies.

08:35.270 --> 08:36.919
That is disgusting.

08:36.919 --> 08:39.393
This is a place where
people come to relax?

08:40.240 --> 08:43.400
What? Oh, that's gross. (whispering)

08:43.400 --> 08:44.232
Seriously?

08:46.331 --> 08:47.498
Ugh, horrible.

08:52.900 --> 08:53.733
Hello.

08:53.733 --> 08:55.280
- Hello.

08:55.280 --> 08:56.420
- You must be Marta.

08:56.420 --> 08:57.430
- I'm Marta.

08:57.430 --> 08:58.570
You must be Gordon. (chuckles)

08:58.570 --> 08:59.403
- That's right.

08:59.403 --> 09:01.350
- Nice to see you, you good?
- You too.

09:01.350 --> 09:02.800
- What an incredible place.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.820
- Oh, thank you. It's different.

09:04.820 --> 09:07.100
- It looks like somebody
spent a lot of money.

09:07.100 --> 09:08.490
- Yeah, we did.

09:08.490 --> 09:09.923
- And how much did you
spend building this place?

09:09.923 --> 09:11.550
- I think it's around 6 million.

09:11.550 --> 09:13.900
- Wow! And what's it worth now?

09:13.900 --> 09:15.023
- Oh, probably two.

09:16.310 --> 09:17.920
- Two million.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.290
- We need help, Gordon.

09:19.290 --> 09:20.287
- Uh, yeah.

09:20.287 --> 09:22.400
Well, I'm here to help.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.888
I mean driveway, woodlands, stunning.

09:24.888 --> 09:26.050
- Thank you.
- I mean, absolutely stunning.

09:26.050 --> 09:29.910
You walk in there, inside
it's caked in dust in there.

09:29.910 --> 09:31.020
- It's not supposed to be.

09:31.020 --> 09:32.757
- Oh, it is, trust me.
- It is? Okay.

09:32.757 --> 09:35.580
- And then the horror for
me was going up there.

09:35.580 --> 09:37.060
Have you been up there recently?

09:37.060 --> 09:38.700
- [Marta] Probably about a month ago.

09:38.700 --> 09:40.820
- Disgusting, flies everywhere.

09:40.820 --> 09:43.340
Not a dozen, couple of hundred, thousands.

09:43.340 --> 09:44.530
Let me give it to you straight.

09:44.530 --> 09:45.870
It looks like staff are taking a piss,

09:45.870 --> 09:47.180
going upstairs for a break,

09:47.180 --> 09:49.480
putting their cigarettes in a bottle.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.090
On the back of one really bad fire,

09:51.090 --> 09:53.260
the last thing you wanna
get is a second one.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.093
- That's true.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.000
- So you're the General Manager?

09:55.000 --> 09:56.720
- I am running it and I'm trying...

09:56.720 --> 09:58.810
Jimmy started a little over a year ago.

09:58.810 --> 10:01.100
But he's so tied with the restaurant.

10:01.100 --> 10:05.780
- So, Jimmy runs the kitchen
and you do everything else.

10:05.780 --> 10:06.613
So, that's a lot on your plate.

10:06.613 --> 10:08.288
- Oh, I help in the kitchen too.

10:08.288 --> 10:09.121
I do the ordering.
- Seriously?

10:09.121 --> 10:10.485
- I do the ordering.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.296
- How come he doesn't do his own ordering?

10:12.296 --> 10:14.210
- Oh, he would if I told him to.

10:14.210 --> 10:15.043
- Right.
- Yeah.

10:15.043 --> 10:17.420
- But everything on your
shoulders running this place?

10:17.420 --> 10:19.190
- Yeah, I guess I'm used to it.

10:19.190 --> 10:20.993
- Yeah. Wow.

10:20.993 --> 10:23.280
So I've never done
anything like this before,

10:23.280 --> 10:25.030
so it's unfounded territory for me.

10:25.030 --> 10:26.100
- Okay.
- In order for me

10:26.100 --> 10:28.550
to see where the cracks are,

10:28.550 --> 10:31.470
what this place is made
of, how good we are.

10:31.470 --> 10:34.643
I've found an amazing couple
that recently just got engaged.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.620
And due to the circumstances
with the groom,

10:38.620 --> 10:42.440
he's having to go off and do military duty

10:42.440 --> 10:43.540
in two week's time.

10:43.540 --> 10:44.373
- Oh, okay.

10:44.373 --> 10:48.080
- So they are coming here

10:48.080 --> 10:51.043
and we are gonna host their wedding.

10:52.040 --> 10:53.240
- Okay, when are we doing it?

10:53.240 --> 10:54.340
- In a couple of days.

10:56.300 --> 10:57.890
- And it's a very important-
- [Marta] How many people?

10:57.890 --> 10:58.920
- 100 guests.

10:58.920 --> 10:59.753
- 100 guests, okay.

10:59.753 --> 11:02.050
- 100 guests, so I need to
see how this place functions

11:02.050 --> 11:04.490
and what you've got, what
the standards are like.

11:04.490 --> 11:05.830
Just the kind of offerings.

11:05.830 --> 11:06.663
- [Marta] Okay.

11:06.663 --> 11:07.496
- Look at it.

11:07.496 --> 11:11.720
It should have way more
than 30 or 40 events a year.

11:11.720 --> 11:12.820
It doesn't make sense.

11:24.201 --> 11:25.750
(lively upbeat music)

11:25.750 --> 11:27.510
Knowing the castle is losing money

11:27.510 --> 11:29.910
by not hosting as many
weddings as they should be.

11:29.910 --> 11:32.170
I wanted to see how I could
improve their standards

11:32.170 --> 11:33.360
and increase revenue.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.193
Roxanne?

11:34.193 --> 11:35.026
- Yeah.

11:35.026 --> 11:36.820
- Nice to see you.
- Likewise, good to see you.

11:36.820 --> 11:37.653
- Eric, how are you?

11:37.653 --> 11:39.540
- So I invited a bride and groom

11:39.540 --> 11:41.240
to get married at the castle.

11:41.240 --> 11:42.710
First of all, let me say congratulations.

11:42.710 --> 11:43.543
- [Both] Thank you.

11:43.543 --> 11:44.650
- I know you're trying
to get married quickly

11:44.650 --> 11:47.580
because you're off on duty.

11:47.580 --> 11:50.360
And so, we wanna make
this somewhat special

11:50.360 --> 11:51.230
because we're doing this once

11:51.230 --> 11:52.450
and there's no rehearsal, right?

11:52.450 --> 11:53.710
- [Both] Right.
- Let's jump in, shall we?

11:53.710 --> 11:54.910
- [Roxanne] Okay, perfect.
- Come in, please.

11:54.910 --> 11:56.790
It's my first time here.

11:56.790 --> 11:57.623
- [Roxanne] Ours, too.

11:57.623 --> 11:58.456
- There we go.

12:00.240 --> 12:03.090
Oh, dear, it looks like
someone's puked on the walls

12:03.090 --> 12:04.104
with a lemon meringue pie.

12:04.104 --> 12:05.921
Oh, dear, oh, dear, look at the ceiling.

12:05.921 --> 12:06.754
- [Roxanne] Yeah, the ceiling's-

12:06.754 --> 12:08.110
- [Gordon] What is that?
- [Roxanne] Really scary.

12:08.110 --> 12:10.430
- The chairs, oh, dear.

12:10.430 --> 12:11.424
- [Roxanne] Those are really stained bad.

12:11.424 --> 12:12.720
- [Gordon] What is that?

12:12.720 --> 12:14.164
What is that? Spandex?

12:14.164 --> 12:15.120
- [Roxanne] Yeah.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.232
- They're not nice, are they?

12:17.232 --> 12:18.082
- Ooh, that's worse. (chuckles)

12:18.082 --> 12:18.915
- [Gordon] Oh, dear, oh, dear.

12:21.380 --> 12:22.270
- [Melody] I'm Melody.

12:22.270 --> 12:23.680
- Hi, I'm Roxanne.

12:23.680 --> 12:24.513
- Roxanne?
- Yes, nice to meet you.

12:24.513 --> 12:26.123
- [Gordon] And Eric.
- Eric.

12:26.123 --> 12:27.890
- [Melody] Welcome to the castle.

12:27.890 --> 12:29.140
- Let's talk about the food.

12:29.140 --> 12:30.090
What do you normally do?

12:30.090 --> 12:31.550
- Normally we do buffets.

12:31.550 --> 12:32.500
- Buffets?
- [Melody] Mm-hmm.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.320
Wow, that's something from the 1980s.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.620
So what do we do about tasting the buffet?

12:36.620 --> 12:37.861
- We don't do tastings.

12:37.861 --> 12:38.694
- You don't do tastings?

12:38.694 --> 12:40.090
- No, we don't do tastings.

12:40.090 --> 12:40.923
- Why not?

12:40.923 --> 12:42.490
- Cause of the kitchen staff.

12:42.490 --> 12:43.960
The setup in the kitchen.

12:43.960 --> 12:45.650
- Not really selling me
on the good wedding site.

12:45.650 --> 12:47.620
You can stay relaxed for now.

12:47.620 --> 12:49.090
Trust me, we are gonna taste some food.

12:49.090 --> 12:50.140
We're gonna take a seat.

12:50.140 --> 12:51.650
We're gonna do some tastings.

12:51.650 --> 12:54.000
- Yeah.
- And I'd like to see a menu.

12:54.000 --> 12:54.883
- Don't worry.

12:54.883 --> 12:55.716
- Okay.

12:55.716 --> 12:56.871
- We'll get this sorted.

12:56.871 --> 12:57.880
- [Gordon] Here you
go, my darling, please.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.520
- Probably got too many set here.

12:59.520 --> 13:00.353
- Take a seat, please.

13:00.353 --> 13:03.580
Before we do any tasting, is
the owner's son here, Jimmy?

13:03.580 --> 13:05.340
He's in charge.
- Yes, Jimmy's here.

13:05.340 --> 13:06.671
- [Gordon] Can we have a quick chat?

13:06.671 --> 13:08.333
- Yeah, sure thing.

13:09.320 --> 13:10.800
- Color's dreadful.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.880
Reception lobby, awful.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.920
- And the linens don't even match.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.220
There's white and ivory.

13:17.220 --> 13:18.330
There's a lot going on the bar, too.

13:18.330 --> 13:19.947
- [Eric] The bar, yeah, I noticed that.

13:19.947 --> 13:22.840
- I'm not sure if that's left
over from another wedding.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.330
- [Gordon] Dreadful.

13:24.330 --> 13:26.320
- [Melody] Jimmy.
- Yeah.

13:26.320 --> 13:27.840
- [Melody] Chef, he'd like to meet you.

13:27.840 --> 13:28.673
- Okay.

13:30.050 --> 13:30.883
Hey.

13:30.883 --> 13:31.780
- You are Jimmy?

13:31.780 --> 13:32.613
- [Jimmy] I'm Jimmy.

13:32.613 --> 13:34.040
- Good to see you.
- Nice to meet you.

13:34.040 --> 13:34.890
- I spoke to mom earlier.

13:34.890 --> 13:36.350
- Yes, yes.
- Let me introduce you to

13:36.350 --> 13:38.310
two very special guests, Roxanne

13:38.310 --> 13:40.230
- Nice to meet you, Roxanne.
- Nice to meet you.

13:40.230 --> 13:41.063
- Eric.

13:41.063 --> 13:43.110
- Eric, nice to meet you.
- You as well.

13:43.110 --> 13:44.894
- So, do you have a chef jacket?

13:44.894 --> 13:45.727
- [Jimmy] I do.

13:45.727 --> 13:46.560
- [Gordon] Do you ever wear it?

13:46.560 --> 13:48.810
- Only when I deliver food.

13:48.810 --> 13:49.643
- Deliver?

13:49.643 --> 13:51.070
- Like bring food out to people.

13:51.070 --> 13:53.280
- Oh, so you just put the
jacket on to carry food?

13:53.280 --> 13:55.170
- Yeah, so I look fancier.

13:55.170 --> 13:57.620
- So, you normally wear a T-shirt to cook?

13:57.620 --> 13:59.000
- Yeah, and pants.

13:59.000 --> 13:59.833
- And pants.
- [Jimmy] Yes.

13:59.833 --> 14:01.790
- That's very kind of you.

14:01.790 --> 14:03.220
Anything you recommend?

14:03.220 --> 14:06.013
I mean, try to sell it a little
bit to the bride and groom.

14:07.260 --> 14:09.800
- There's certain things on
there I've never made before.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.300
So that probably-

14:11.300 --> 14:12.510
- Stop, two seconds.

14:12.510 --> 14:13.343
- Yes.

14:13.343 --> 14:15.670
- You got things on your menu
that you've never made before?

14:15.670 --> 14:17.520
- Well, no one's ever ordered them.

14:17.520 --> 14:18.940
- But you run a restaurant here.

14:18.940 --> 14:19.773
- Yes.

14:19.773 --> 14:21.289
- That's not a buffet.
- [Jimmy] No.

14:21.289 --> 14:22.122
- That's plated.

14:22.122 --> 14:25.100
- I should definitely know
how to make them, I agree.

14:25.100 --> 14:27.990
I've never cooked a fillet mignon before.

14:27.990 --> 14:30.300
- You've never cooked a fillet mignon?

14:30.300 --> 14:31.133
- Who cooks it?

14:31.133 --> 14:32.090
- We've never sold one.

14:32.090 --> 14:33.330
- Fucking hell.

14:33.330 --> 14:35.350
- So, no one's ever had a
wedding and ordered fillet?

14:35.350 --> 14:37.600
- Not since I've been here, not for me.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.271
- You've got things on here
you've never cooked before.

14:39.271 --> 14:40.490
You've never cooked a fillet?

14:40.490 --> 14:42.160
- Correct.
- So just out of interest,

14:42.160 --> 14:44.940
fillet mignon comes up, you
gonna go to a culinary school?

14:44.940 --> 14:45.773
What happens?

14:45.773 --> 14:48.483
- Maybe Google how to do it exactly.

14:49.940 --> 14:50.773
- Google?

14:50.773 --> 14:51.606
- Yes.

14:51.606 --> 14:53.500
- I mean, I could do that. (laughs)

14:53.500 --> 14:55.690
- Jeez, Google a fillet?

14:55.690 --> 14:56.539
- Yeah.

14:56.539 --> 14:58.520
- To watch a video?

14:58.520 --> 14:59.760
- Yes.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.130
- Our wedding food is really good.

15:01.130 --> 15:02.370
- Well, I can't wait to taste it.

15:02.370 --> 15:05.650
Let's have a look at this
and I'll see you later.

15:05.650 --> 15:06.620
- Sounds good.

15:06.620 --> 15:08.990
- Wow, okay, sorry about that.

15:08.990 --> 15:11.810
After learning, Jimmy gets
his recipes from the internet.

15:11.810 --> 15:13.870
I'm starting to feel
like I've made a mistake

15:13.870 --> 15:16.540
inviting the bride and groom
to have their wedding here.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.240
- So we have a stuffed chicken.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.170
- To keep some options
for Roxanne and Eric,

15:20.170 --> 15:23.410
I told Jimmy to prepare
a selection of dishes.

15:23.410 --> 15:26.100
Up first, a chicken dish
that I couldn't believe

15:26.100 --> 15:27.968
was smothered in soggy cheese.

15:27.968 --> 15:29.240
Look at that bit there.

15:29.240 --> 15:30.589
It's like my granddad's foreskin.

15:30.589 --> 15:32.020
(Roxanne and Eric laughs)

15:32.020 --> 15:34.280
Not good, no wonder grandma
used to get upset at night.

15:34.280 --> 15:37.600
- Okay, over medium heat, add
olive oil, let it get hot.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.130
- While, Jimmy surf the internet

15:39.130 --> 15:40.780
for how to cook a fillet mignon.

15:40.780 --> 15:45.780
- Let the fillets in a hot pan.

15:46.840 --> 15:48.780
- We were served a salmon dish.

15:48.780 --> 15:51.260
I mean, I wouldn't feed that to my cat.

15:51.260 --> 15:55.210
It is bland, it's undercooked,
simply raw in the middle.

15:55.210 --> 15:57.050
- It's a little slimy almost.

15:57.050 --> 15:59.770
- And knowing Jimmy had
never cooked a fillet mignon,

15:59.770 --> 16:02.550
trust me, my expectations weren't high.

16:02.550 --> 16:05.410
That steak is terrible, it's overcooked.

16:05.410 --> 16:06.790
You've cooked better than
that at home, wouldn't you?

16:06.790 --> 16:07.623
- Yeah.

16:07.623 --> 16:09.700
- Now I know why there's
no tastings available.

16:09.700 --> 16:12.870
I mean, terrible, terrible,
terrible, terrible.

16:12.870 --> 16:14.930
I'm embarrassed, and I
just wanna apologise.

16:14.930 --> 16:17.140
I was expecting it way better than this.

16:17.140 --> 16:17.973
- Yeah.

16:17.973 --> 16:19.491
Me, us too, I think.

16:19.491 --> 16:20.620
- Yeah.

16:20.620 --> 16:22.470
- Be patient. Let me get to
the bottom of this, okay?

16:22.470 --> 16:23.320
- [Roxanne] Okay.

16:24.720 --> 16:27.670
- It's clear the castle standards are low.

16:27.670 --> 16:29.920
And with only two days to
put together a wedding,

16:29.920 --> 16:31.240
I'm feeling a lot of pressure

16:31.240 --> 16:33.623
and I don't wanna
disappoint Roxanne and Eric.

16:36.300 --> 16:38.580
Hi, how are you both? Are you well?

16:38.580 --> 16:39.540
How are you guys feeling?

16:39.540 --> 16:40.750
- Discouraged.

16:40.750 --> 16:45.031
I mean, it's an important day for us

16:45.031 --> 16:49.510
and the food's really
important and it's like...

16:49.510 --> 16:51.640
I think about this and I want it to be

16:51.640 --> 16:53.230
the best day of my life.

16:53.230 --> 16:55.220
And then it's disappointing.

16:55.220 --> 16:56.560
- Something you want people to remember

16:56.560 --> 16:58.285
for a good reason, not a bad.

16:58.285 --> 16:59.750
- [Roxanne] Yeah, exactly.
- [Gordon] Of course.

16:59.750 --> 17:02.870
- I see lots of young couples
and we host lots of weddings

17:02.870 --> 17:04.810
but that's new territory for me.

17:04.810 --> 17:07.050
I've never seen a space,
a member of staff,

17:07.050 --> 17:08.500
so disconnected to the real deal.

17:08.500 --> 17:11.839
- I don't think we thought
it was gonna be like this.

17:22.479 --> 17:25.760
(dramatic upbeat music)

17:25.760 --> 17:28.630
- There's only two days till
Roxanne and Eric's wedding,

17:28.630 --> 17:30.320
and having witnessed the lack of attention

17:30.320 --> 17:32.190
to the event space and menu,

17:32.190 --> 17:35.450
tonight I need to see how Marta and Jimmy

17:35.450 --> 17:37.977
run their restaurant on a regular night.

17:37.977 --> 17:38.920
- Hey, how are you?

17:38.920 --> 17:40.277
- TJ.
- TJ, good to see you.

17:40.277 --> 17:41.700
And this is?

17:41.700 --> 17:43.366
- I'm Shayla.
- Shayla, nice to see you.

17:43.366 --> 17:44.199
- I'm Jimmy's wife.

17:44.199 --> 17:45.032
- Oh, Jimmy's wife?
- Yes.

17:45.032 --> 17:47.088
- Okay, chef's wife, cook's
wife, General Manager's wife.

17:47.088 --> 17:47.921
- Yes.

17:47.921 --> 17:49.530
- Right, what is he, a GM or a cook?

17:49.530 --> 17:50.480
- A little bit of both.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.480
- A little bit of both?
- Yes.

17:51.480 --> 17:52.433
- Excellent.
- Good answer? (chuckles)

17:52.433 --> 17:53.840
- What do you do, TJ?

17:53.840 --> 17:55.270
- I'm just the host tonight.

17:55.270 --> 17:56.103
- Excellent.

17:59.903 --> 18:00.793
So, so, so.

18:02.473 --> 18:03.980
They've all fucked off.

18:03.980 --> 18:05.247
- Jimmy, the sea bass.

18:05.247 --> 18:06.080
- What about it.

18:06.080 --> 18:07.878
- It needs to go on, it's with this order.

18:07.878 --> 18:08.809
- [Jimmy] Okay, I don't-

18:08.809 --> 18:10.320
- Uh, good evening.

18:10.320 --> 18:11.450
- [Jimmy] Good evening.

18:11.450 --> 18:12.780
- [Marta] Hey, Gordon.

18:12.780 --> 18:15.230
She has a brushette listed here, too.

18:15.230 --> 18:17.533
- Six minutes on that.
- We haven't met yet, have we?

18:17.533 --> 18:18.800
- No, I'm Grant.

18:18.800 --> 18:19.783
- Grant, good to see you.

18:19.783 --> 18:21.640
And you're sous chef?

18:21.640 --> 18:22.473
- Yes.

18:25.690 --> 18:27.910
- And are you working in
the kitchen tonight as well?

18:27.910 --> 18:29.320
- Yeah, I sort of help 'em.

18:29.320 --> 18:31.719
- Wow, what don't you do
in this establishment?

18:31.719 --> 18:33.413
(Marta chuckles)
- [Jimmy] Nothing.

18:34.430 --> 18:36.130
- Yeah, I can't think of anything.

18:38.850 --> 18:39.980
- Holy crap.

18:39.980 --> 18:43.030
So, you cook all the fish
and meat on the same thing?

18:43.030 --> 18:44.730
- We do the meat on the left side

18:44.730 --> 18:46.910
and the fish on the right side.

18:46.910 --> 18:47.920
- It's all the same flat.

18:47.920 --> 18:48.753
- Yes.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.553
- So you saying everything on
the left doesn't hit the right

18:50.553 --> 18:52.670
and everything on the
right doesn't hit the left?

18:52.670 --> 18:53.720
I've never seen that.

18:56.608 --> 18:58.240
It's weird that food sits there.

18:58.240 --> 18:59.290
Shayla?
- Yes, sir.

18:59.290 --> 19:01.163
- Why do they put food
here? Is this where they-

19:01.163 --> 19:02.710
- This is the warmer, this is the-

19:02.710 --> 19:03.990
- On the wall?

19:03.990 --> 19:06.760
- Yes, this is just what we have.

19:06.760 --> 19:08.080
It's crazy.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.540
- Jesus, but where..

19:09.540 --> 19:11.340
The kitchen's in there and they
just stick this on the wall?

19:11.340 --> 19:13.000
So, how do you know whose is whose?

19:13.000 --> 19:13.890
You just pick up.

19:13.890 --> 19:15.616
- [Shayla] We take the
wrong plates all the time.

19:15.616 --> 19:18.210
- What a fucked up scenario that is.

19:18.210 --> 19:19.890
- What is this? Is this done?

19:19.890 --> 19:20.723
- [Grant] I think so.

19:20.723 --> 19:22.220
- I don't have any idea what all this meat

19:22.220 --> 19:23.283
goes to right now.

19:23.283 --> 19:24.970
What are these two flat irons for?

19:24.970 --> 19:25.870
Does anybody know?

19:27.100 --> 19:28.510
- Here's a flat iron.

19:28.510 --> 19:30.180
- Medium-rare.
- And there's a flat iron.

19:30.180 --> 19:32.263
- But I don't know what tables they go to.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.033
- Jesus!

19:39.650 --> 19:41.840
Fuck me, I've never...

19:41.840 --> 19:43.140
That is a beef stroganoff?

19:43.140 --> 19:43.973
- What's that?

19:45.093 --> 19:46.820
- Just show me that one.

19:46.820 --> 19:47.770
- A beef stroganoff.

19:47.770 --> 19:48.730
- Yeah.
- Yes.

19:48.730 --> 19:49.563
- Bring it down, please.

19:49.563 --> 19:50.396
- Yes.

19:51.870 --> 19:52.863
It's how I was told to make it.

19:52.863 --> 19:54.740
- I mean, it looks like prison food.

19:54.740 --> 19:56.140
Whose table is that stroganoff?

19:56.140 --> 19:57.040
- That's mine.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.370
- That's yours, and what
are you waiting for now?

19:59.370 --> 20:00.203
- The rest.

20:00.203 --> 20:02.950
- That was on a single ticket,
but there's six of 'em.

20:02.950 --> 20:04.210
- Seriously.

20:04.210 --> 20:06.120
Why is it not all on the same ticket?

20:06.120 --> 20:07.760
- Well, cause they wanted separate bills.

20:07.760 --> 20:10.100
So I wrote 'em all on separate tickets

20:10.100 --> 20:11.018
cause that's how we-

20:11.018 --> 20:12.500
- But you do that at the end.

20:12.500 --> 20:13.480
The kitchen needs one ticket

20:13.480 --> 20:15.870
so they can serve all
the entrees together.

20:15.870 --> 20:16.964
- Go.

20:16.964 --> 20:19.063
- Oh my God, OMG.

20:20.410 --> 20:22.225
What are you waiting for, my darling?

20:22.225 --> 20:23.058
- One of those stroganoffs.

20:23.058 --> 20:23.891
- A stroganoff?

20:23.891 --> 20:25.557
- Yeah.
- Where are we at here?

20:25.557 --> 20:27.100
One French fry.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.770
Okay, do we have anything on the six-top?

20:29.770 --> 20:30.825
What's she waiting on?

20:30.825 --> 20:32.367
- Stroganoffs, I guess.

20:32.367 --> 20:34.427
And this doesn't really
have any sauce in it,

20:34.427 --> 20:37.210
but I can't help it that it got messed up.

20:37.210 --> 20:38.830
Just take it.

20:38.830 --> 20:41.390
- Ah, you just deserve better, I'm sorry.

20:41.390 --> 20:43.823
Oh, here's your stroganoff,
10 minutes later.

20:44.880 --> 20:45.713
There we go.

20:45.713 --> 20:47.400
- Your plate's hot too, so be careful.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.150
- Yours looks completely different.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.130
Wow, what a mess.

20:52.130 --> 20:54.933
What a mess, Oh jeez.

20:57.200 --> 20:59.550
Jimmy, that's been sat there
for 15 minutes now, this one.

20:59.550 --> 21:00.383
- [Jimmy] Which has?

21:00.383 --> 21:01.216
- This one here.

21:01.216 --> 21:02.049
- [Marta] What is it?

21:02.049 --> 21:03.030
- [Jimmy] What are you waiting on?

21:03.030 --> 21:05.300
- I've never seen this kind
of dysfunctional kitchen.

21:05.300 --> 21:08.060
So one dish, three minutes
later another dish comes along.

21:08.060 --> 21:09.970
The girls are coming up
and seeing the flatirons,

21:09.970 --> 21:11.430
seeing the chicken and just going.

21:11.430 --> 21:13.710
Because there's no uniform.

21:13.710 --> 21:15.030
- [Becki] A table's been waiting.

21:15.030 --> 21:15.910
- Where's your tickets?

21:15.910 --> 21:16.743
- Right there.

21:16.743 --> 21:20.170
- Okay, just take this medium-rare
flatiron then, I guess.

21:20.170 --> 21:21.680
We apparently need another castle.

21:21.680 --> 21:22.690
Did we make that or not?

21:22.690 --> 21:26.323
Someone must have taken the
ticket down without us knowing.

21:27.738 --> 21:30.250
- This steak was supposed to be medium.

21:30.250 --> 21:33.000
And the other lady, her
potatoes garlic mashed,

21:33.000 --> 21:34.360
were ice cold.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.220
- Oh, God.

21:36.095 --> 21:38.310
- [Marta] They want it more well-done.

21:38.310 --> 21:39.900
They want it more well-done.

21:39.900 --> 21:41.540
- The same piece or another one?

21:41.540 --> 21:43.092
- No, we'll have to put it back on.

21:43.092 --> 21:43.925
- Okay.

21:44.890 --> 21:46.290
- I've gathered that the restaurant

21:46.290 --> 21:48.690
has absolutely no organisation.

21:48.690 --> 21:51.256
But what is more alarming
is how dependent Jimmy is

21:51.256 --> 21:53.153
on his mother to run this business.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.187
- [Shayla] You guys,
good night, thank you.

21:56.187 --> 21:57.187
- Thank you.

21:58.520 --> 22:00.022
- We did it, that was easy.

22:00.022 --> 22:02.855
(Melody laughing)

22:05.358 --> 22:06.853
- I'm not gonna laugh.

22:08.290 --> 22:09.765
Let's just go back to the beginning.

22:09.765 --> 22:12.700
Driving in and looking at
the place, breathtaking.

22:12.700 --> 22:15.210
Walk into the reception,
and it's just caked in dust.

22:15.210 --> 22:18.730
And that tower, in front of the entrance

22:18.730 --> 22:22.030
is laden with 5,000 dead flies.

22:22.030 --> 22:24.610
Tonight, I just wanted to see
how this place functioned.

22:24.610 --> 22:26.270
And hand on heart, I've never seen

22:26.270 --> 22:30.170
such a dysfunctional
business in all my life.

22:30.170 --> 22:32.733
Surely, you must know
that this is not right.

22:36.690 --> 22:39.293
- I think we know that, but-
- You think?

22:41.720 --> 22:43.810
- I speak for myself and
I can say I know that.

22:43.810 --> 22:44.970
- And yet everybody walks around

22:44.970 --> 22:47.170
as if we're doing a great
job and laughing and joking

22:47.170 --> 22:50.060
as if to say, "We've got
something to be proud of."

22:50.060 --> 22:51.510
- I wouldn't say we're in denial.

22:51.510 --> 22:52.910
- No, bullshit.

22:52.910 --> 22:57.910
I got told when I checked in,
Jimmy is the General Manager.

22:58.230 --> 23:00.410
Can I just tell you the feeling

23:00.410 --> 23:03.650
when you walk into this
place there's no authority,

23:03.650 --> 23:05.390
there's no responsibility

23:05.390 --> 23:07.750
And staff are just going
through the motions.

23:07.750 --> 23:09.360
And if you are even going to attempt

23:09.360 --> 23:10.900
to step up to that position,

23:10.900 --> 23:12.980
you can't go home, pat
yourself on the back

23:12.980 --> 23:14.347
saying you're doing a great job.

23:14.347 --> 23:17.000
You need to start implementing.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.060
- Gordon, we would like this

23:18.060 --> 23:20.117
to be the starting point of that.

23:20.117 --> 23:22.300
You know, we want that.

23:22.300 --> 23:25.180
We just, you know, you
get a little overwhelmed

23:25.180 --> 23:29.033
and you don't know how to proceed.

23:29.970 --> 23:32.230
- The general consensus in this building

23:32.230 --> 23:35.150
is that you are generally running around

23:35.150 --> 23:37.650
seven days a week for everybody.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.000
- That's true.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.660
- [Gordon] And tonight,
I witnessed it firsthand.

23:41.660 --> 23:44.246
This is no life for a lady in her 60s.

23:44.246 --> 23:45.232
- No, it isn't.

23:45.232 --> 23:46.880
- Banging her head against the wall.

23:46.880 --> 23:48.310
That is not right.

23:48.310 --> 23:49.470
Can I just have two minutes

23:49.470 --> 23:50.805
with your mother on my own, please?

23:50.805 --> 23:51.638
- Yes.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.560
- This is insane.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.590
Honestly, you looked like

23:57.590 --> 23:59.780
the pot washer's assistant tonight.

23:59.780 --> 24:00.730
- I know.

24:00.730 --> 24:03.077
Sometimes I am the pot washer's assistant.

24:05.018 --> 24:06.309
- Seriously?

24:06.309 --> 24:07.804
- [Marta] Yeah.

24:07.804 --> 24:08.637
- It's not helping.
- I think I've gotten

24:08.637 --> 24:11.280
so used to it and so I just keep doing it.

24:11.280 --> 24:13.520
- I know, but you're doing more and more

24:13.520 --> 24:17.050
every week, every month, every
year, and it's not right.

24:17.050 --> 24:18.815
And that must be having a toll somewhere.

24:18.815 --> 24:20.430
You can't continue like this.

24:20.430 --> 24:21.750
- I agree.

24:21.750 --> 24:24.863
- Has your son taken
enough responsibility?

24:26.490 --> 24:29.840
- I think that he
probably feels that he has

24:29.840 --> 24:33.900
because he's never probably
had the life that I've had

24:33.900 --> 24:37.710
to know what it's like to
work from morning to night.

24:37.710 --> 24:42.048
- He's never felt the jeopardy
that you do on a daily basis.

24:42.048 --> 24:43.372
- No.
- Nowhere near it.

24:43.372 --> 24:44.205
- No one has.

24:44.205 --> 24:45.040
- And it shows.

24:45.040 --> 24:47.880
He knows you're gonna do
it, and that's the problem.

24:47.880 --> 24:50.070
And he's got so used to that

24:50.070 --> 24:52.060
that he's not gonna come
out of his comfort zone

24:52.060 --> 24:54.260
and do any more, because
he doesn't need to.

24:55.305 --> 24:56.490
- Yeah.

24:56.490 --> 24:58.500
- I want Jimmy to wake up

24:58.500 --> 25:00.860
and take the burden off your shoulders.

25:00.860 --> 25:04.320
And step up and start showing
some form of responsibility.

25:04.320 --> 25:06.240
You should think about a letter

25:06.240 --> 25:09.870
about what you need
from him going forward.

25:09.870 --> 25:12.973
Think about something
strong and speak openly.

25:13.890 --> 25:16.350
And if you can commit that to me,

25:16.350 --> 25:19.190
then I'm gonna commit myself to you

25:19.190 --> 25:21.513
and getting this place back on the map.

25:22.660 --> 25:23.493
- Yeah.

25:24.550 --> 25:25.383
- [Gordon] Promise.

25:25.383 --> 25:26.216
- I promise.

25:26.216 --> 25:27.153
- [Gordon] Thank you.

25:29.403 --> 25:30.240
- Okay.

25:30.240 --> 25:31.090
- Get some rest.

25:31.090 --> 25:32.151
- Okay.

25:32.151 --> 25:35.318
(lively upbeat music)

25:36.670 --> 25:38.930
- It's very important for
hotels that host weddings

25:38.930 --> 25:40.970
to not only focus on the event itself,

25:40.970 --> 25:42.670
but other services as well.

25:42.670 --> 25:43.503
- Front desk.

25:43.503 --> 25:46.990
- I'd like to order the $79
breakfast in bed package.

25:46.990 --> 25:50.470
So, I ordered a room service
package for Roxanne and Eric.

25:50.470 --> 25:52.390
- You guys enjoy.
- [Roxanne] Thank you so much.

25:52.390 --> 25:53.330
- [Melody] We will see you soon.

25:53.330 --> 25:54.280
- [Eric] All right.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.320
- Thought I'd check in on you, how is it?

26:00.320 --> 26:01.730
- [Roxanne] It's tastes uncooked.

26:01.730 --> 26:05.150
- Oh, God, it's just gone from
bad to worse, my apologies.

26:05.150 --> 26:06.940
After seeing their disappointment

26:06.940 --> 26:09.510
and that nothing was special
about the experience,

26:09.510 --> 26:12.670
I sent someone from my team
to put together a gift basket

26:12.670 --> 26:16.150
to show how much higher their
standards really need to be.

26:16.150 --> 26:18.100
This is just basic stuff.

26:18.100 --> 26:18.960
You two dig in.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.713
We got some work to do.

26:20.713 --> 26:23.880
(lively upbeat music)

26:27.410 --> 26:30.670
Last night, I asked Marta
to write a letter to Jimmy

26:30.670 --> 26:34.230
outlining her needs
for him moving forward.

26:34.230 --> 26:37.197
I'm hoping this can show
Jimmy he needs to step up.

26:37.197 --> 26:38.153
You okay?

26:38.153 --> 26:38.986
- Yeah.

26:42.090 --> 26:44.750
- How long did it take to
put this thing together?

26:44.750 --> 26:49.150
- Probably an hour, an hour
and a half to think about it.

26:49.150 --> 26:50.940
I went to sleep around 5:00 a.m.

26:50.940 --> 26:53.383
- What? You went to
sleep at 5:00 a.m.? Why?

27:01.570 --> 27:03.240
- Just thinking about
everything that went on

27:03.240 --> 27:07.063
and wishing it wouldn't
have been the way it was.

27:08.760 --> 27:13.760
Knowing there's a lot to fix
and just being completely

27:16.070 --> 27:19.023
overwhelmed at all the aspects of it.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.120
I have a lot of nights
like that. (chuckles)

27:23.120 --> 27:24.550
- That's exactly what he needs to hear.

27:24.550 --> 27:26.290
And that's what we've got left

27:26.290 --> 27:27.730
in order to get through to him.

27:27.730 --> 27:29.780
That's why he needs to
feel your pain a little bit

27:29.780 --> 27:31.864
because you've been too
good masking over it.

27:31.864 --> 27:35.276
- Yeah, I do probably do that a lot.

27:35.276 --> 27:37.250
- You need to stop accepting everything

27:37.250 --> 27:38.393
to make things better for yourself now

27:38.393 --> 27:40.270
and not being so easy on your son

27:40.270 --> 27:41.700
and being a little bit more selfish,

27:41.700 --> 27:43.540
because you're too kind, too generous.

27:43.540 --> 27:45.930
- Right, I agree with that.
- Cause you need a break.

27:45.930 --> 27:46.913
- Yeah.
- Quick.

27:47.830 --> 27:48.883
- Yeah, you're right.

27:50.993 --> 27:53.100
- I'm gonna go get him.
- Okay, thank you.

27:53.100 --> 27:56.683
(gentle suspenseful music)

27:57.883 --> 27:59.633
- Jimmy, two seconds, please.

28:01.410 --> 28:02.463
Take a seat.

28:02.463 --> 28:05.230
(gentle suspenseful music)

28:05.230 --> 28:08.680
Your mother, she left last night, upset.

28:08.680 --> 28:10.660
I want you to listen
to something important.

28:10.660 --> 28:11.493
- [Jimmy] Yes.

28:11.493 --> 28:13.090
- I just want you to listen, okay?

28:15.127 --> 28:17.690
- "Dear, Jimmy, I worked 20 years

28:17.690 --> 28:21.230
at the colouring book
factory being on call 24/7.

28:21.230 --> 28:23.970
I, of course, thought that
when we sold the business,

28:23.970 --> 28:25.510
we would retire.

28:25.510 --> 28:27.443
Unfortunately, that didn't happen.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.750
I know you have always seen me work hard,

28:30.750 --> 28:34.650
but the financial part of it
has been just as stressful.

28:34.650 --> 28:38.210
It is so disheartening when
we could get complaints

28:38.210 --> 28:41.970
about such stupid things
as dust and uncleanliness.

28:41.970 --> 28:43.010
It has to stop.

28:43.010 --> 28:44.030
There's no excuse for it.

28:44.030 --> 28:45.433
It has to change.

28:46.670 --> 28:47.792
No one has more to gain

28:47.792 --> 28:51.380
by making the castle
successful than you do.

28:51.380 --> 28:53.440
Let's make this place what it should be,

28:53.440 --> 28:56.847
a great future for all of us. Love, Mom."

29:00.860 --> 29:03.285
- I just wanna say thank you.

29:03.285 --> 29:04.118
- I know.

29:05.991 --> 29:06.824
I know.

29:08.435 --> 29:13.435
I love you so.

29:19.137 --> 29:20.528
- You know this can't continue.

29:20.528 --> 29:22.030
- [Jimmy] I know that.

29:22.030 --> 29:25.160
And where I'm coming from,
it's about stepping up.

29:25.160 --> 29:28.450
That means putting mom out
of the day-to-day running

29:28.450 --> 29:32.810
and you getting firm, strong,

29:32.810 --> 29:35.563
and making some serious fucking decisions.

29:36.850 --> 29:39.360
- I don't want to give the
impression that I'm too proud

29:39.360 --> 29:40.890
or I'm a spoiled brat cause-

29:40.890 --> 29:42.433
- How much do you want this?

29:45.501 --> 29:48.040
- I don't know if there's a
real word for it, but I want it.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.903
I want, I mean-

29:50.940 --> 29:53.110
- Could I just have two
minutes with him, please.

29:53.110 --> 29:54.650
Go in the kitchen, get yourself a coffee

29:54.650 --> 29:55.650
and close that door.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.850
I don't fucking feel it enough.

30:03.850 --> 30:04.683
That's all.

30:04.683 --> 30:07.770
I don't get excited by it.

30:07.770 --> 30:12.690
She, your mother, hasn't
got long left at this pace.

30:12.690 --> 30:14.800
And if you've got a pair of balls,

30:14.800 --> 30:16.280
you better start fucking using them.

30:16.280 --> 30:18.620
And I want you to use them quick.

30:18.620 --> 30:21.230
I don't think you fully understand

30:21.230 --> 30:22.870
just what a gift you've got.

30:22.870 --> 30:24.880
- I don't think I do either.

30:24.880 --> 30:27.710
I feel it, but I don't
fully have a grip of it.

30:27.710 --> 30:28.660
- No.

30:28.660 --> 30:31.220
And whilst I am here, I
want to see you commit.

30:31.220 --> 30:32.053
- Okay.

30:32.053 --> 30:33.230
- And show me how hungry you are.

30:33.230 --> 30:34.330
- I will. Yes, sir.

30:34.330 --> 30:36.000
- And when you see something wrong-

30:36.000 --> 30:36.833
- Say something.

30:36.833 --> 30:39.034
- Fucking sort it out like
your mom's been doing.

30:39.034 --> 30:39.867
- I will.

30:39.867 --> 30:40.700
- Got it?

30:40.700 --> 30:41.533
- Got it.

30:41.533 --> 30:44.450
(light airy music)

30:45.670 --> 30:47.090
- It's the day before the wedding,

30:47.090 --> 30:49.150
and preparations are underway.

30:49.150 --> 30:51.570
- Normally we have a
soft drink/soda station

30:51.570 --> 30:53.470
on the antique hutch down there.

30:53.470 --> 30:55.350
- While the staff discuss
last-minute details

30:55.350 --> 30:56.870
with Roxanne and Eric,

30:56.870 --> 31:01.170
my team and I are completely
making over the event space.

31:01.170 --> 31:03.690
We're upgrading the drab
interior with a modern decor

31:03.690 --> 31:06.430
to brighten the room and
create an inviting space.

31:06.430 --> 31:09.597
(gentle upbeat music)

31:10.535 --> 31:13.702
(lively upbeat music)

31:15.734 --> 31:17.510
- [Gordon] Are you ready?
- [Marta] Can we run? (laughs)

31:17.510 --> 31:18.343
- [Gordon] Then let's go.

31:18.343 --> 31:20.550
- [Marta] Okay.
- [Gordon] Brace yourselves.

31:20.550 --> 31:23.190
What you're about to see is mind-blowing.

31:23.190 --> 31:24.100
Jump in.

31:24.100 --> 31:26.290
- [Marta] Oh, my goodness.
- [Gordon] Welcome.

31:26.290 --> 31:28.910
- Oh, my goodness.

31:28.910 --> 31:29.767
- [Gordon] Come on in.

31:29.767 --> 31:30.742
- [Woman] Oh, my goodness.
- [Melody] Oh, wow.

31:30.742 --> 31:31.931
- [Shayla] Oh, it's beautiful.

31:31.931 --> 31:32.777
- [Jimmy] Oh, my goodness.

31:32.777 --> 31:36.490
- Now, where shall we start?

31:36.490 --> 31:37.323
- Oh, my.

31:37.323 --> 31:39.950
- [Jimmy] Just the lighting
alone feels more inviting.

31:39.950 --> 31:41.020
It's a different world.

31:41.020 --> 31:43.020
- [Gordon] Gone is that
ghastly yellow colour.

31:43.020 --> 31:45.590
- [Marta] Oh, it's beautiful, Melody.

31:45.590 --> 31:47.940
- [Melody] Beyond what I
ever could have imagined.

31:47.940 --> 31:50.870
- I can't believe it's the
same place, that's awesome.

31:50.870 --> 31:54.288
- Complete new panelling
all the way around.

31:54.288 --> 31:55.710
(Marta laughs)

31:55.710 --> 31:57.930
- Absolutely breathtaking.
- Oh, it's beautiful.

31:57.930 --> 32:00.440
- So let's have a little
focus on the tables.

32:00.440 --> 32:01.640
Brand new chairs.

32:01.640 --> 32:02.810
- [Marta] Oh, my goodness.

32:02.810 --> 32:03.643
- [Jimmy] It's amazing.

32:03.643 --> 32:04.724
- [Gordon] Beautiful. Take a seat.

32:04.724 --> 32:05.830
(group laughing)

32:05.830 --> 32:07.388
Now we have proper elegant chairs.

32:07.388 --> 32:09.830
- [Marta] Look at the chargers,
aren't they beautiful?

32:09.830 --> 32:12.100
- Check out the floor, brand new floor.

32:12.100 --> 32:14.360
- [Marta] Yeah, so nice.

32:14.360 --> 32:16.463
- Look at the space over
there now with the bar.

32:16.463 --> 32:18.150
- [Marta] It's so nice.

32:18.150 --> 32:19.710
- [Melody] It's like out of a magazine.

32:19.710 --> 32:21.620
- This is what it's like during the day.

32:21.620 --> 32:22.605
Can you imagine what it's
going to be like at night?

32:22.605 --> 32:23.730
- [Melody] Oh, my goodness, you're right.

32:23.730 --> 32:25.447
- With the candles lit
on the table flickering.

32:25.447 --> 32:27.120
- This is what we've needed.

32:27.120 --> 32:28.709
I mean, we need guidance.

32:28.709 --> 32:31.180
We've just been spinning
our tyres for so long.

32:31.180 --> 32:32.609
- Right, and you happy?

32:32.609 --> 32:33.442
- [Marta] I'm happy.

32:33.442 --> 32:34.570
- Good, I'm glad you're happy.

32:34.570 --> 32:36.420
- I'm probably the most excited I've been

32:36.420 --> 32:39.890
except maybe when my babies
and grandbabies were born.

32:39.890 --> 32:41.989
I'm literally that excited.

32:41.989 --> 32:43.097
- [Jimmy] It's beautiful.
- [Marta] Oh, so beautiful.

32:43.097 --> 32:44.735
- Thank you so much.

32:44.735 --> 32:46.915
- You're welcome.

32:46.915 --> 32:50.082
(lively upbeat music)

32:52.840 --> 32:55.950
Now, let's talk food.

32:55.950 --> 32:57.967
- [Jimmy] Yes.
- Ladies, can we line up here?

32:57.967 --> 32:59.913
Let's just take one of each menus.

33:00.760 --> 33:02.830
I've got a plan for the food.

33:02.830 --> 33:06.000
Let's focus first on the menu
and plates for the restaurant.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.540
Let's start off at the beginning.

33:07.540 --> 33:09.750
French onion soup and a bowl of chilli.

33:09.750 --> 33:10.680
- [Jimmy] Oh, wow.

33:10.680 --> 33:12.756
- [Gordon] We got the beef
stroganoff with wild mushrooms.

33:12.756 --> 33:13.930
- [Jimmy] Oh, yeah.

33:13.930 --> 33:15.560
- Next to that, you got
the chicken Alfredo.

33:15.560 --> 33:16.980
- [Melody] I like that.

33:16.980 --> 33:20.030
- Let's focus on the big
menu for the wedding tonight.

33:20.030 --> 33:23.890
The perfect entrée is
the braised short ribs.

33:23.890 --> 33:25.270
- [Marta] Oh, beautiful.

33:25.270 --> 33:26.730
- [Gordon] Next to that,
we got local walleye.

33:26.730 --> 33:27.563
- [Jimmy] That's amazing.

33:27.563 --> 33:28.490
- Beautifully seared.

33:28.490 --> 33:30.010
- Oh, look at that.

33:30.010 --> 33:31.420
Oh, that's beautiful.

33:31.420 --> 33:33.019
- Nothing complicated.

33:33.019 --> 33:35.224
- [Jimmy] And everything
looks so appetising, too.

33:35.224 --> 33:36.190
- [Gordon] Clean.

33:36.190 --> 33:37.260
- [Jimmy] Yes.

33:37.260 --> 33:40.070
- But there is one thing
missing, and that's a chef.

33:40.070 --> 33:42.710
So I've arranged for a unique person

33:42.710 --> 33:44.180
that has been working with me in Vegas

33:44.180 --> 33:45.350
for the last five years.

33:45.350 --> 33:48.402
She is incredible and she's
gonna be your consultant chef.

33:48.402 --> 33:49.330
- Okay.

33:49.330 --> 33:51.447
- Let me introduce you to Keisha.

33:51.447 --> 33:52.750
Good morning, my darling.

33:52.750 --> 33:54.106
Come stand over here, please.

33:54.106 --> 33:56.057
- Thank you. Nice to see you guys.

33:56.057 --> 33:59.080
- So, Marta, this young
lady knows her stuff.

33:59.080 --> 34:02.110
She's gonna help instal
somebody on a full-time basis.

34:02.110 --> 34:03.780
But the hand-over process

34:03.780 --> 34:05.450
is gonna be part of her responsibility.

34:05.450 --> 34:06.460
- [Marta] Are you excited, Grant?

34:06.460 --> 34:07.840
- Very, very excited.

34:07.840 --> 34:09.139
- Yay.
- [Gordon] Grant,

34:09.139 --> 34:10.330
work closely with her.

34:10.330 --> 34:11.163
- Absolutely.

34:11.163 --> 34:14.659
- Now, remember, tonight, you're
gonna step up and run this.

34:14.659 --> 34:16.650
The burden is now on your shoulders.

34:16.650 --> 34:18.174
- I'm prepared to take it.

34:18.174 --> 34:21.257
(gentle piano music)

34:23.245 --> 34:24.282
- Morning.
- Hello.

34:24.282 --> 34:25.201
- Hello, gorgeous.

34:25.201 --> 34:27.141
- Come on in.
- Morning, ladies.

34:27.141 --> 34:28.322
How are you? You look amazing.

34:28.322 --> 34:31.165
When I check in with Roxanne
and Eric to assure them

34:31.165 --> 34:32.753
that everything is on
track with their wedding.

34:32.753 --> 34:33.889
How are you feeling?

34:33.889 --> 34:34.723
- Very good.

34:34.723 --> 34:35.681
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34:35.681 --> 34:36.514
- I just want to give you the heads up

34:36.514 --> 34:37.699
room's looking gorgeous.

34:38.639 --> 34:40.460
- Okay, now let's just set 'em up.

34:40.460 --> 34:41.980
- [Gordon] I put Jimmy
in charge of managing

34:41.980 --> 34:45.139
the entire event from the
ceremony to the reception.

34:45.139 --> 34:46.179
- [Jimmy] That's a cool layout.

34:46.179 --> 34:47.560
- [Melody] Isn't it pretty
here with the sun coming now?

34:47.560 --> 34:48.960
- Yeah, it's pretty.

34:48.960 --> 34:51.370
- While the castle has done
many events in the past

34:51.370 --> 34:54.210
I'm hoping this wedding
not only raises the bar,

34:54.210 --> 34:58.100
but puts it on the map
as a destinational spot.

34:58.100 --> 34:59.766
Gents, how are you? You
look great, by the way.

34:59.766 --> 35:01.510
- [Boy] Thank you.
- Ah, so smart.

35:01.510 --> 35:03.430
All good? You look smart as well.

35:03.430 --> 35:04.263
Where's Eric?

35:04.263 --> 35:05.096
- [Jimmy] He's already out there.

35:05.096 --> 35:06.923
- [Gordon] How are we looking?
- Looks great, so far.

35:06.923 --> 35:07.865
Everything's beautiful.

35:07.865 --> 35:09.200
- Great. Here's the bride.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.950
The bride's coming, everybody.

35:10.950 --> 35:12.920
Wow, she looks gorgeous.

35:12.920 --> 35:14.467
As they sit down, let's go into the room

35:14.467 --> 35:17.100
and let's just go over everything.

35:17.100 --> 35:18.020
Get the team together

35:18.020 --> 35:20.290
and we'll get our timing
absolutely nailed.

35:20.290 --> 35:22.850
- Welcome, everyone to this
beautiful, glorious day

35:22.850 --> 35:26.343
of the union of Roxanne and Eric.

35:27.190 --> 35:29.790
- So you guys aren't used
to doing plated service.

35:29.790 --> 35:31.220
It's been buffet after buffet.

35:31.220 --> 35:33.280
That's gone, say good-bye to the 1970s.

35:33.280 --> 35:34.780
Welcome to the 21st century.

35:34.780 --> 35:35.700
- Great.
- Want some finesse.

35:35.700 --> 35:36.960
It's a wedding, it's not a funeral.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.230
- Yes, be happy.
- So fun.

35:38.230 --> 35:40.660
We get into weeds, we get ourselves out.

35:40.660 --> 35:41.770
It's not a race, guys.

35:41.770 --> 35:42.950
Who's the General Manager?

35:42.950 --> 35:43.820
- [All] Jimmy.

35:43.820 --> 35:44.653
- [Gordon] Excellent.

35:44.653 --> 35:45.742
Who's in charge of the kitchen?

35:45.742 --> 35:46.575
- [All] Grant.

35:46.575 --> 35:48.520
- That's right, talk, communicate.

35:48.520 --> 35:51.030
Any last words of advice for the team?

35:51.030 --> 35:52.130
- Just stay positive.

35:52.130 --> 35:53.450
You know, it's their big day.

35:53.450 --> 35:54.950
We don't want them to see our problems.

35:54.950 --> 35:56.040
- Yeah, good luck, guys.

35:56.040 --> 35:57.650
Thank you. Jimmy, let's go.

35:57.650 --> 36:00.300
- I now pronounce you husband and wife.

36:00.300 --> 36:01.755
You may kiss your bride.

36:01.755 --> 36:03.578
(upbeat orchestral music)

36:03.578 --> 36:07.495
(people cheering and clapping)

36:09.629 --> 36:12.450
- All right, everybody, I
hope you enjoyed the ceremony.

36:12.450 --> 36:14.763
We're gonna head over to the event hall.

36:16.500 --> 36:17.870
- All right, ladies, help sit them down.

36:17.870 --> 36:19.873
- Got it.
- Please, as quick as you can.

36:21.040 --> 36:21.920
- Table 5.

36:21.920 --> 36:23.313
- Right here's table 11.

36:24.250 --> 36:25.083
- What would you like?

36:25.083 --> 36:27.200
- I'll do the short ribs, please.

36:27.200 --> 36:28.190
- So here we go.

36:28.190 --> 36:29.630
Grant takes every ticket

36:29.630 --> 36:31.843
and don't accept a ticket
until you understand it.

36:31.843 --> 36:32.810
- [Grant] Absolutely.

36:32.810 --> 36:33.959
- [Gordon] Okay, that's the only way.

36:33.959 --> 36:34.977
- [Dinner] The fish.
- The fish.

36:34.977 --> 36:36.440
- Can we do the walleye, please?

36:36.440 --> 36:37.790
- Walleye, okay, very good.

36:38.700 --> 36:42.060
- Okay, so you've got to
synchronise with the DJ

36:42.060 --> 36:43.460
to announce the bride and groom.

36:43.460 --> 36:44.470
Big moment, this one.
- Perfect, absolutely.

36:44.470 --> 36:45.790
- Okay, so focus on the timing.

36:45.790 --> 36:46.623
Yes?
- Yep.

36:48.310 --> 36:49.143
- How are you?

36:49.143 --> 36:51.210
So when you walk back in,
that's when you cue the DJ.

36:51.210 --> 36:52.440
- Yes.
- Cause the DJ is gonna make

36:52.440 --> 36:54.020
the announcement, "Ladies and gentlemen,

36:54.020 --> 36:55.282
be up standing for the bride and groom."

36:55.282 --> 36:56.950
- Yes.
- It's a crucial moment now.

36:56.950 --> 36:57.783
- Yes, sir.

36:57.783 --> 36:59.550
I'm gonna go up there
right now and talk to 'em

36:59.550 --> 37:02.050
and find out when they're
exactly coming down.

37:02.050 --> 37:04.850
As soon as I come back in the room,

37:04.850 --> 37:06.860
you'll see me walk in the
door, so be kind of looking.

37:06.860 --> 37:08.050
As soon as I walk in-

37:08.050 --> 37:09.390
- But you have to get
everyone's attention.

37:09.390 --> 37:10.420
- [DJ] We will, yeah.

37:10.420 --> 37:12.347
- What's all this for?

37:12.347 --> 37:13.800
- We're only doing the bride and groom.

37:13.800 --> 37:15.746
- I just want to get their pronunciation

37:15.746 --> 37:16.579
for the bride and groom.

37:16.579 --> 37:18.500
- It's just Roxanne and Eric.

37:18.500 --> 37:20.030
- Oh, you're not going
to give their last name?

37:20.030 --> 37:22.397
- No, Jimmy, how do you
announce the bride and groom?

37:22.397 --> 37:24.240
"Please, be up standing for Mr. and Mrs."

37:24.240 --> 37:25.320
Mr. and Mrs...

37:25.320 --> 37:27.990
Is it Wular or Gulardi?

37:27.990 --> 37:29.630
Is the pronunciation.

37:29.630 --> 37:31.176
- Jimmy, you should have
this nailed, you should know.

37:31.176 --> 37:33.697
- That's what I was
told, Gulardi, Galardi.

37:33.697 --> 37:35.100
- [Gordon] Gulardi?
- Gallarde.

37:35.100 --> 37:36.450
- I don't want to fuck up with
the bride and groom, okay?

37:36.450 --> 37:37.560
- I understand.

37:37.560 --> 37:39.210
- We have to be fucking seamless.

37:40.563 --> 37:41.396
- [DJ] Gallarde?

37:41.396 --> 37:42.673
- Mm-hmm, I'll confirm it.

37:43.777 --> 37:44.610
- [Gordon] We got to get this sorted out.

37:44.610 --> 37:45.510
- You just wait outside for me.

37:45.510 --> 37:46.690
- Okay, let's do that.

37:47.810 --> 37:49.017
- Oh, my God.

37:49.017 --> 37:52.184
(lively upbeat music)

37:53.060 --> 37:54.303
- I want you tell the DJ how to pronounce

37:54.303 --> 37:56.010
your last name correctly.
- [Eric] All right.

37:56.010 --> 37:57.955
- You couldn't have been
like the Smiths or something.

37:57.955 --> 37:59.030
(Eric and Roxanne laugh)

37:59.030 --> 38:00.220
- Okay, so I'm gonna go in

38:00.220 --> 38:01.810
and kind of get everyone's attention.

38:01.810 --> 38:03.280
And go ahead and give me

38:03.280 --> 38:05.170
how do you would like to be introduced?

38:05.170 --> 38:06.900
- Mr. and Mrs. Eric Gualdoni.

38:06.900 --> 38:08.610
- The bride and groom are
two minutes away, okay.

38:08.610 --> 38:10.170
Be careful, yes.

38:10.170 --> 38:11.003
- Ladies and gentlemen,

38:11.003 --> 38:12.680
if I could have your attention, please.

38:12.680 --> 38:15.570
We have a very special couple
right outside that door.

38:15.570 --> 38:18.160
And we would like to give them

38:18.160 --> 38:20.540
a big welcome as they enter the room.

38:20.540 --> 38:22.010
Let's have a nice round of applause

38:22.010 --> 38:24.966
for the new Mr. and Mrs. Eric Gualdoni.

38:24.966 --> 38:27.799
(guests cheering)

38:29.285 --> 38:30.840
At this time, they are going to be making

38:30.840 --> 38:32.180
their way to the dance floor

38:32.180 --> 38:34.980
to share their first dance
together as husband and wife.

38:37.216 --> 38:40.150
(lively upbeat music)

38:40.150 --> 38:41.560
- [Gordon] We're now serving the entrees.

38:41.560 --> 38:43.879
- Just make sure all the
asparagus are lining the same way.

38:43.879 --> 38:45.132
This is the ends are together.

38:45.132 --> 38:46.010
- [Grant] Like so?

38:46.010 --> 38:48.180
- Yes, five plates, please, Grant.

38:48.180 --> 38:49.013
- [Gordon] Service, please.

38:49.013 --> 38:50.130
And that's the top table.

38:50.130 --> 38:51.098
- [Jimmy] I'm gonna give it to the bride.

38:51.098 --> 38:51.931
- Go.

38:51.931 --> 38:53.950
Second table, you have
four fish, two beef, yes?

38:53.950 --> 38:54.930
- [Jimmy] Everything look nice?

38:54.930 --> 38:57.130
- Oh, my gosh, the
presentation is beautiful.

38:57.130 --> 38:57.963
- Yeah, that's awesome.

38:57.963 --> 38:58.796
- [Eric] Yes.
- [Roxanne] I love it.

38:58.796 --> 39:00.660
- Good to hear, I'll come
back and check on you soon.

39:00.660 --> 39:02.230
- Take any plates out of your way here?

39:02.230 --> 39:03.133
You're good?

39:03.133 --> 39:04.560
- Shayla, Shayla.

39:04.560 --> 39:07.130
Why are you clearing when the
whole table haven't finished?

39:07.130 --> 39:07.963
- Melody asked me to cover-

39:07.963 --> 39:10.483
- That is so fucking wrong, so wrong.

39:11.340 --> 39:12.173
So his plate is cleared,

39:12.173 --> 39:14.240
and she's now playing with her food.

39:14.240 --> 39:15.640
So from a woman's point-
- She feels uncomfortable.

39:15.640 --> 39:17.130
- Of course she does, so you know that.

39:17.130 --> 39:17.963
This is what I'm saying to you.

39:17.963 --> 39:19.700
I can't tell you the obvious.

39:19.700 --> 39:20.680
Cause you know this shit.

39:20.680 --> 39:21.660
- I have to pay more attention.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.887
- Yeah, and I want them
looked after like royalty.

39:23.887 --> 39:24.720
And so do you, right?

39:24.720 --> 39:25.770
- Yes, I'm gonna see if they want

39:25.770 --> 39:26.810
any more champagne right now.

39:26.810 --> 39:27.643
- Yeah.

39:27.643 --> 39:28.970
- Okay.

39:28.970 --> 39:30.540
I'm gonna come back with some champagne

39:30.540 --> 39:32.790
to top everybody off, okay.

39:32.790 --> 39:36.430
- Marta, the atmosphere
in here is incredible.

39:36.430 --> 39:37.263
- [Marta] It is.

39:37.263 --> 39:38.260
- I mean, it really is.

39:38.260 --> 39:40.280
However, Jimmy needs
to be on top of things.

39:40.280 --> 39:41.113
- Right.

39:41.113 --> 39:43.300
- He needs to nail the
small attention to details.

39:43.300 --> 39:44.720
But just look at the atmosphere.

39:44.720 --> 39:46.340
The difference is night and day.

39:46.340 --> 39:47.330
- [Marta] Yep, they're happy.

39:47.330 --> 39:48.530
- Let's keep 'em that way.

39:48.530 --> 39:50.520
No, get the staff to do that.

39:50.520 --> 39:51.860
Put that down.
- Okay, okay

39:51.860 --> 39:52.867
- You're the owner.

39:52.867 --> 39:53.700
- I know.

39:53.700 --> 39:54.900
- You are the owner.
- They keep asking me

39:54.900 --> 39:55.840
to go get beer and go get this.

39:55.840 --> 39:56.693
I'm not supposed to?
- No.

39:56.693 --> 39:58.150
They're picking up after you.

39:58.150 --> 39:58.983
You're not picking up after them.

39:58.983 --> 39:59.816
- Okay.

39:59.816 --> 40:00.649
- Those days have gone.

40:00.649 --> 40:01.707
- Okay, thank you.

40:03.300 --> 40:04.140
- How was dinner?

40:04.140 --> 40:06.460
- I'm waiting for my wife
to pass over her plate

40:06.460 --> 40:09.680
so I can finish it off. (dinners laughter)

40:09.680 --> 40:10.730
- How's everything tasting?

40:10.730 --> 40:12.320
- It's beautiful.

40:12.320 --> 40:13.580
- Isn't it awesome?

40:13.580 --> 40:14.413
- [Eric] I love you.

40:14.413 --> 40:15.813
(Roxanne chuckles)

40:15.813 --> 40:18.646
(guests cheering)

40:23.553 --> 40:26.386
- Right, you two, my time is done.

40:27.761 --> 40:28.594
What a day.

40:28.594 --> 40:29.488
You look amazing, seriously.

40:29.488 --> 40:30.321
- Thank you so much.

40:30.321 --> 40:32.004
- I mean, really, have you had a good day?

40:32.004 --> 40:33.479
- Thank you, today was perfect.

40:33.479 --> 40:34.482
- Yeah.
- Absolutely perfect.

40:34.482 --> 40:36.430
- Eric?
- Everything that

40:36.430 --> 40:38.910
she could have asked for,
that I could have asked for.

40:38.910 --> 40:40.260
It's been phenomenal.

40:40.260 --> 40:41.750
- Thank you both for your patience.

40:41.750 --> 40:43.800
Because when we first met at
the beginning of the week,

40:43.800 --> 40:45.048
I was more nervous than you two.

40:45.048 --> 40:46.480
(Eric and Roxanne chuckle)

40:46.480 --> 40:47.313
Good luck to you both.

40:47.313 --> 40:50.847
- Thank you so much, thank you.

40:50.847 --> 40:51.820
- Take care of yourself.

40:51.820 --> 40:55.400
- I totally thought when we
first got here, we're settling.

40:55.400 --> 40:58.050
This isn't what I want, but
we need to do this quickly.

40:58.050 --> 41:00.250
And now it is the fairy
tale that you think

41:00.250 --> 41:01.720
when you see a castle.

41:01.720 --> 41:02.870
- [Eric] It's jaw-dropping,

41:02.870 --> 41:04.560
the transformation that was made.

41:06.667 --> 41:08.440
- And how are you feeling first?

41:08.440 --> 41:09.700
- I'm feeling great.

41:09.700 --> 41:10.740
- The ceremony was amazing.

41:10.740 --> 41:11.860
- [Both] It was.

41:11.860 --> 41:12.840
- Who's the General Manager.

41:12.840 --> 41:13.673
- Jimmy is.

41:13.673 --> 41:14.506
- Who's the owner?

41:14.506 --> 41:15.530
- I am. (chuckles)
- That's right.

41:15.530 --> 41:18.040
And you just oversee it.

41:18.040 --> 41:18.873
- Okay.

41:18.873 --> 41:20.390
- I don't want you chasing
trash cans anymore.

41:20.390 --> 41:21.350
- [Marta] I know, I know.
- I don't want you

41:21.350 --> 41:22.420
sweeping up the bathroom.
- [Jimmy] It's gotta stop.

41:22.420 --> 41:23.400
- Look after yourself.

41:23.400 --> 41:24.500
- Okay, thank you.

41:24.500 --> 41:26.010
- I need 30 seconds with your son.

41:26.010 --> 41:28.150
- Okay, good-bye.

41:28.150 --> 41:29.070
I appreciate it so much.

41:29.070 --> 41:29.903
- Enjoy this place, okay?

41:29.903 --> 41:31.260
- I will, I will.

41:31.260 --> 41:32.093
- You deserve it.

41:32.093 --> 41:32.926
- Thanks so much.

41:32.926 --> 41:33.759
- Goodnight.

41:33.759 --> 41:35.090
- Goodnight.

41:35.090 --> 41:37.800
- I do not want to see
your mom sweeping up.

41:37.800 --> 41:39.466
- I don't either.
- You need to step up.

41:39.466 --> 41:40.700
I couldn't believe you forgot

41:40.700 --> 41:42.180
the name of the bride and groom.

41:42.180 --> 41:43.530
- Yes, that was bad.

41:43.530 --> 41:45.650
- However, your mind's in the right place.

41:45.650 --> 41:47.090
Do not be scared of change.

41:47.090 --> 41:48.630
Tonight was a little rough.
- Yeah.

41:48.630 --> 41:51.340
- But think of the difference
you made on that young couple.

41:51.340 --> 41:53.540
- I know, they seem so
appreciative of everything.

41:53.540 --> 41:55.110
- And the first thing they gonna do,

41:55.110 --> 41:56.710
they're gonna go tell all their friends.

41:56.710 --> 41:58.210
This amazing wedding they've had.

41:58.210 --> 41:59.043
- Yes.

41:59.043 --> 42:01.030
- You're gonna promise me that
you're gonna stay on track.

42:01.030 --> 42:02.710
- I'm gonna put in the work, I promise.

42:02.710 --> 42:03.543
- Good luck.

42:03.543 --> 42:04.802
- Thank you.
- Take care.

42:04.802 --> 42:05.900
- Have a safe trip.

42:05.900 --> 42:07.073
- Thank you. Goodnight.

42:08.530 --> 42:09.380
- Thanks, Gordon.

42:10.363 --> 42:12.223
- (exhales deeply) Wow.

42:15.316 --> 42:18.233
(light airy music)

42:20.430 --> 42:23.260
Since my last visit,
Landoll's Mohican Castle

42:23.260 --> 42:25.820
has steadily increased their bookings.

42:25.820 --> 42:28.570
Keisha has reorganised the kitchen.

42:28.570 --> 42:29.750
And with Jimmy's help,

42:29.750 --> 42:32.850
they have found a new head
chef to take the lead.

42:32.850 --> 42:36.480
And Jimmy has finally taken
charge as General Manager.

42:36.480 --> 42:38.120
- Let's make a plan and figure out

42:38.120 --> 42:39.720
what we wanna do timing-wise.

42:39.720 --> 42:40.820
- [Gordon] Allowing his mother

42:40.820 --> 42:43.133
to take a step back as an owner.
