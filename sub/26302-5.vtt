00:01.569 --> 00:03.737
-The Lyons are
hitting back on Empire.
-(shouts)

00:03.771 --> 00:06.174
-May we rise.
-Like we always do.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.076
Catch all-new episodes
Wednesdays.

00:10.244 --> 00:13.081
Star, 9-1-1, and The Resident.

That's a win-win.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.586
Previously on Empire...

00:18.619 --> 00:20.254
Empire showed me
a whole nother world.

00:20.288 --> 00:22.056
And I turned it down.
You guys made me feel

00:22.090 --> 00:23.757
-like I was home.
-It kills me

00:23.791 --> 00:25.693
not to be able
to protect my son in there.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.928
If you want it, it's yours.
It's a new song.

00:27.961 --> 00:30.398
I'll record it with you,
but it's just for us.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.266
We haven't heard anything
from Kai in 48 hours.

00:32.300 --> 00:35.103
-They found his wallet
and his cell phone.
-No, Ma.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.240
NEWSWOMAN: We continue to track
the latest information

00:39.273 --> 00:41.075
regarding missing reporter
Kai Givens,

00:41.109 --> 00:43.010
who has now been missing
for five days.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.946
I can't even imagine
my life without him.

00:45.979 --> 00:47.415
You know, when I had
my heart attack,

00:47.448 --> 00:49.083
you know what kept me alive?

00:49.117 --> 00:50.918
Your crazy-ass sons?

00:50.951 --> 00:54.555
(chuckles)
Yeah, of course my babies did,

00:54.588 --> 00:56.090
but it was your father's face.

00:56.124 --> 00:58.592
Yeah, knowing I had
that kind of love

00:58.626 --> 01:01.061
to come back to
kept me fighting,

01:01.095 --> 01:04.432
and that kind of love
is gonna keep Kai fighting, too.

01:04.465 --> 01:05.766
Mark my word.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.735
I hope so.

01:07.768 --> 01:09.603
NEWSWOMAN: ...for what has
happened to this news team,

01:09.637 --> 01:11.439
-and there have been
no demands for ransom.
-(phone ringing)

01:11.472 --> 01:13.641
Answer.
(scoffs)

01:13.674 --> 01:16.810
Answer the phone, boy. Here.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.846
Hello?

01:20.348 --> 01:23.317
Okay.

01:23.351 --> 01:26.587
Okay, yeah.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.756
Understood.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.658
Thank you.

01:33.161 --> 01:35.763
They found Kai. (chuckles)

01:35.796 --> 01:38.899
(laughs):
I told you, boy! Come here.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.801
So they brought him back.
They brought him back here.

01:40.834 --> 01:44.104
-Yes.
-He's-he's at the hospital.

01:45.873 --> 01:49.009
* Trust in love... *

01:49.042 --> 01:52.112
I'm telling you, Jackson,
you ain't heard talent like this

01:52.146 --> 01:54.948
since back in the day
when you was still my intern.

01:54.982 --> 01:57.851
(scoffs) That was
a long time ago, Lucious.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.320
Back when dripping a Lyon chain
around your neck

01:59.353 --> 02:00.588
made you somebody.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.823
-(chuckles)
-It's true, though.

02:02.856 --> 02:04.692
Devon's got
what I'm looking for,

02:04.725 --> 02:06.294
but a demo ain't
enough anymore, Lu.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.828
Wait, since when?

02:07.861 --> 02:10.698
I mean, talent,
true talent, that don't change.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.166
This kid?

02:12.200 --> 02:14.768
No. Devon. Remember that.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.370
He lucky you backing him.

02:16.404 --> 02:19.373
-Otherwise he'd get lost
in the shuffle.
-(music stops)

02:19.407 --> 02:21.809
Hit me up when you got
more for me to hear.

02:24.812 --> 02:28.115
You know, actually,
um, we're hosting

02:28.148 --> 02:30.551
this listening party
this Friday.

02:30.584 --> 02:33.287
Um, thought I'd come by here
and give you first crack at him

02:33.321 --> 02:36.224
since you and me go way back,
but we can do it your way.

02:36.257 --> 02:39.026
I'm-a have a couple other
industry folk there,

02:39.059 --> 02:41.562
and I tell you,
this might get real cutthroat

02:41.595 --> 02:45.699
when y'all see him perform live,
so bring your best offer, man.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.703
ANDRE:
It's been two years, gentlemen.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.739
Fratres, usque in sempiternum.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.307
-Uh.
-Ah.

02:53.341 --> 02:55.676
-ALL: Frat brothers forever.
-(chuckles)

02:55.709 --> 02:58.246
How you doing, man?
It's been a minute.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.180
Yeah, that's what happens
when you get locked up.

03:00.214 --> 03:03.884
(chuckles)
I'm kidding.

03:03.917 --> 03:07.855
Damn, you'd think you all
just got out from serving time.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.523
Come on now, loosen up.

03:09.557 --> 03:12.059
Andre Lyon is in the building
with you guys. Come on, now.

03:12.092 --> 03:14.562
Heard you getting back
into the family business.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.163
Yeah, you know,
it's like a start-up.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.831
Everybody's pitching in
and hanging in there

03:17.865 --> 03:19.533
till we get into the black.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.502
Do you need us to throw
some consulting cases your way?

03:21.535 --> 03:24.104
With my record,
that might be complicated.

03:24.137 --> 03:26.574
Come on, we all know
you're not a real criminal.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.509
Yeah, my-my conviction's
pretty real.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.043
Yeah, but you're not one of
these dangerous animals

03:30.077 --> 03:32.045
they need to just lock up
and throw away the key.

03:32.079 --> 03:35.015
(chuckles)
Well, uh...

03:35.048 --> 03:37.951
not everybody in there
is an animal, you know?

03:37.985 --> 03:41.622
Yeah, yeah,
but you are one of us.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.090
-To Andre.
-Andre.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.628
Cheers.

03:51.799 --> 03:54.568
-Hi. Uh, Kai Givens.
-Right over there.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.604
He's right there, Mom.

03:58.238 --> 04:01.241
-Kai. Hey. You okay?
-Hey.

04:01.275 --> 04:02.810
(chuckles)

04:02.843 --> 04:04.244
Come here.

04:04.278 --> 04:05.579
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm all right.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.781
Yeah.

04:07.815 --> 04:09.950
Oh, my God.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.719
(whispers):
Thank goodness.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.253
(crying):
It's so good to see you.

04:13.287 --> 04:14.655
-Baby.
-Can I see that smile?

04:14.688 --> 04:17.525
-Oh, come on. (chuckles)
-Can I see that smile, please?

04:19.960 --> 04:21.729
-That's what got me home.
-COOKIE: I told you.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.164
-Didn't I tell you that?
-She literally did.

04:24.197 --> 04:27.668
-(laughs): She did.
-Don't you scare my baby
like that again.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.470
-Never. I promise. (chuckles)
-Okay.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.672
-(chuckles) Welcome back,
sweetheart.
-Thank you.

04:31.705 --> 04:34.675
-What happened? What happened?
-Me and my crew got ambushed.

04:34.708 --> 04:37.611
Th-They were chasing us,
and I-I don't know how,

04:37.645 --> 04:39.747
but we escaped and then
made it across the border.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.182
-Ooh, look at you, a hero.
-(laughter)

04:42.215 --> 04:44.918
Hate to interrupt, but, uh,
if you give us the room,

04:44.952 --> 04:47.120
I'll wrap this up and you can
have him all to yourself.

04:47.154 --> 04:48.989
-Yeah.
-No, no, nah, no, no.
Don't worry about it, Doc.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.691
This-this is family.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.829
-Come on.
-Your arm laceration is minor.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.798
The stitches should dissolve
within the week.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.100
Your labs came back.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.002
Your viral load
is slightly elevated.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.637
It's to be expected.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.439
You've been off your HIV meds,

05:05.473 --> 05:06.940
and your immune system
was fighting

05:06.974 --> 05:08.642
to keep your wound
from getting infected.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.210
We'll have
your viral load levels

05:10.243 --> 05:11.945
back to undetectable in no time.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.847
Uh, excuse me.
Yeah, hey, Jamal.

05:13.881 --> 05:16.183
Let's give them some privacy.

05:16.216 --> 05:18.819
Yeah, yeah. I love you.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.621
-I love you, too.
-I love you.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.189
All right. Okay.

05:22.222 --> 05:25.025
(Jamal chuckles)

05:25.058 --> 05:27.895
(sighs)

05:27.928 --> 05:31.799
Why is that doctor saying
all those words in there

05:31.832 --> 05:34.702
like Kai has HIV?

05:34.735 --> 05:36.704
Oh, um...

05:36.737 --> 05:40.173
um, 'cause Kai
does have HIV, Mom.

05:40.207 --> 05:42.876
(sighs) What?

05:45.012 --> 05:47.915
Okay, so you just gonna
let him get you sick?

05:49.917 --> 05:52.753
-Are you sick, Jamal?
-No, Mom.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.922
Kai's undetectable
when he's on his meds,

05:54.955 --> 05:56.590
which makes it almost impossible
to transmit the virus,

05:56.624 --> 05:58.191
and I'm on PrEP.

05:58.225 --> 06:00.694
PrEP? What the hell is that?
Are you prepping to die?

06:00.728 --> 06:02.530
It's for people like me
who are HIV-negative

06:02.563 --> 06:04.064
so that we don't get infected.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.033
This ain't something new, Ma.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.601
It ain't like
it's just for the gays.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.603
So you acting like
ain't no side effects, huh?

06:09.637 --> 06:10.738
What do you know?

06:10.771 --> 06:12.172
Wh-What is this stuff
doing to your body?

06:12.205 --> 06:13.841
I do. And, yes, there are.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.342
But I made the decision
as a grown man

06:15.375 --> 06:17.344
to do what I have to do
to live a healthy life

06:17.377 --> 06:18.512
with the man that I love.

06:18.546 --> 06:20.581
Now, I'm done talking
about my sex life.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.382
Kai's home, Mom. That's amazing.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.452
-Please do not ruin this.
-Mm-hmm.

06:24.485 --> 06:27.755
Better to ruin one moment
than the rest of your life.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.623
He is my life.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.898
Hey. You okay?

06:37.931 --> 06:39.633
Yeah, of course.

06:42.102 --> 06:44.472
*

06:55.583 --> 06:58.586
"Everything you need to know
about living with HIV"?

06:58.619 --> 07:01.455
Uh... (sighs) Can you not
roll up on me like that?

07:01.489 --> 07:02.723
Well, you invited us over

07:02.756 --> 07:04.224
to help plan
Devon's listening party.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.259
Three days ain't much time.

07:06.293 --> 07:08.295
I'm not lifting a finger
until you explain...

07:08.328 --> 07:10.297
-why were you googling HIV?
-Okay, first of all, zip it.

07:10.330 --> 07:12.232
Can you keep your voice down?

07:12.265 --> 07:14.067
Second of all, I'm just trying

07:14.101 --> 07:16.403
to figure out if
I'm gonna sign this artist

07:16.436 --> 07:17.905
who has AIDS, that's all.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.406
CAROL:
Oh, wow.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.774
Ooh, ooh.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.342
Really?

07:22.375 --> 07:26.413
Um, w-what's this bruise?
What happened?

07:26.446 --> 07:27.848
What bruise? Let me see.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.783
(gasps)

07:29.817 --> 07:32.185
CAROL: We saw you and Kevin
fighting the other day.

07:32.219 --> 07:34.822
CANDACE: Oh, please.
My husband wouldn't dare.

07:34.855 --> 07:38.526
(sighs) Things just got a little
rowdy at spin class, that's all.

07:38.559 --> 07:41.094
Oh, so do you spin with
your hands or your feet?

07:41.128 --> 07:42.162
I'm confused.

07:42.195 --> 07:43.597
CANDACE:
Back to this artist.

07:43.631 --> 07:46.266
Cook, don't do it.
You can't trust those people.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.168
Oh, here she go
with her judgmental ass.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.603
Did I tell y'all
about the scandal

07:49.637 --> 07:51.304
that happened at my church
this past year?

07:51.338 --> 07:53.306
-Uh, no, and I don't have time.
-Nope, not interested.

07:53.340 --> 07:54.642
-Ooh, my pastor...
-Oh, my God.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.343
...he was caught sleeping
with a few good men

07:56.376 --> 07:58.178
and passed on AIDS
to the first lady.

07:58.211 --> 07:59.847
God rest her soul.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.883
We black women, we're the ones
that are dying from this.

08:02.916 --> 08:06.286
The hell this got to do
with the artist?

08:06.319 --> 08:08.789
Those people that catch
this disease are reckless

08:08.822 --> 08:11.458
-and just irresponsible.
-Please, stop.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.627
CAROL:
"Those people" are human.

08:13.661 --> 08:17.631
-Where's your compassion?
-All I'm saying is, Cook,

08:17.665 --> 08:21.434
why risk exposing your brand-new
company and your family to this?

08:23.671 --> 08:26.807
-(kissing)
-(Tiana giggles)

08:26.840 --> 08:28.809
Oh, my gosh.

08:28.842 --> 08:33.480
I have to get up.
I have to get up. (chuckles)

08:33.513 --> 08:36.049
Babe. So, you know that thing

08:36.083 --> 08:38.686
with Kai missing,
got me thinking

08:38.719 --> 08:41.722
that our time is precious
together, every second.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.523
Let me.

08:47.628 --> 08:50.130
Princess.

08:56.804 --> 08:59.673
So, you agree?
I can move back in?

08:59.707 --> 09:02.209
Hold on.
We're not back together.

09:02.242 --> 09:05.713
But we should be.
I'm not drinking or fighting.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.681
I know.

09:07.715 --> 09:10.550
(chuckles)
Look, I can't do this right now.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.753
I have to get my pitch ready
for Kingsley.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.788
Have to.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.932
Walking around
with that gun on your hip

09:24.965 --> 09:28.135
is not gonna bring back
what we lost.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.837
You understand that, right?

09:34.074 --> 09:36.276
-(Tiana laughing)
-(Hakeem grunting playfully)

09:36.309 --> 09:38.712
-(R&B music playing)
-Oh.
-Ah.

09:38.746 --> 09:39.913
TIANA:
Guys are so silly.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.649
HAKEEM: The Realtor's
still waiting for us

09:41.682 --> 09:43.483
-to put our offer in.
-Do you think that this is

09:43.516 --> 09:44.785
the right time?

09:44.818 --> 09:46.887
Eddie practically sidelined me.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.489
HAKEEM: We need a big enough
space for our babies,

09:49.522 --> 09:50.958
somewhere we could be together
and be safe.

09:50.991 --> 09:53.293
(gasps softly)
You want to come feel, Bella?

09:55.195 --> 09:58.098
-Okay, ooh. You feel it?
-HAKEEM: Love you.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.933
(kissing)

09:59.967 --> 10:02.770
*

10:02.803 --> 10:05.639
Babe. Babe.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.675
I think my water just broke.

10:10.377 --> 10:13.914
TIANA:
You understand that, right?

10:13.947 --> 10:15.916
Yeah, I know that, babe,

10:15.949 --> 10:18.919
but I'm not gonna be caught up
like that again, for nobody.

10:18.952 --> 10:22.322
I'm-a prove to you I'm ready
to come home to my family.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.359
Okay.

10:26.393 --> 10:30.197
But be serious this time.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.632
All right, I need
to get back to work.

10:34.835 --> 10:38.305
DEVON: * I'll just leave
these cards on the table *

10:38.338 --> 10:44.011
* Just so we can be
in the same boat. *

10:44.044 --> 10:45.378
That's promising.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.715
Um, the delivery's
kind of slick.

10:47.748 --> 10:50.650
Smooth. I'm all about smooth.

10:50.684 --> 10:53.120
No. Smooth is something
you got to earn, brother.

10:53.153 --> 10:56.223
I mean slick like...
I don't feel it.

10:56.256 --> 10:59.026
You-you barely let me
get through the first verse.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.128
-Oh.
-I got an idea for the bridge.
Check this out.

11:01.161 --> 11:04.131
* It's more than enough for me *

11:04.164 --> 11:06.666
* I love making love
to your mind *

11:06.700 --> 11:09.669
* But we can't do it
all in one night, girl. *

11:09.703 --> 11:11.238
You're holding back.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.573
I mean, a higher love
don't mean a damn thing

11:13.606 --> 11:15.709
if it's not coming
from a higher place...

11:15.743 --> 11:17.745
* It's more than enough for me *

11:17.778 --> 11:20.313
* I love making love
to your mind *

11:20.347 --> 11:22.850
-* But we can't do it
all in one night... *
-No. Stop, stop, stop.

11:22.883 --> 11:27.320
Getting louder doesn't mean
I'm gonna feel it more.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.189
BLAKE: * If they ain't
breathing, I ain't living *

11:29.222 --> 11:30.590
* Can't express this feeling,
praying... *

11:30.623 --> 11:32.659
TIANA:
Okay, here comes the hook.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.929
* Lost all control
in the blink of an eye *

11:35.963 --> 11:39.099
* Just a single thought
went across my mind *

11:39.132 --> 11:40.600
* I'm asking, I'm begging,
I'm pleading *

11:40.633 --> 11:44.171
* Just for one more minute,
one more minute *

11:44.204 --> 11:46.006
BLAKE: * Yeah, just take me back
so I can... *

11:46.039 --> 11:47.207
Stop it.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.409
-(music stops)
-What is this?

11:49.442 --> 11:52.179
Okay, it's rough, but I wanted
y'all to hear it first.

11:52.212 --> 11:56.216
Sonically, it's... it's what
I want for my comeback album.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.018
KINGSLEY: You want to hinge
your whole comeback

11:58.051 --> 12:02.422
on a glorified feature
for an unsigned artist?

12:02.455 --> 12:06.860
Um, no, but this track
really speaks my truth.

12:06.894 --> 12:09.963
About your barely-literate
baby daddy, Hakeem Lyon?

12:09.997 --> 12:11.799
Why are you conjuring up
this fool

12:11.832 --> 12:14.134
instead of the agreed upon
buzzwords of "family"

12:14.167 --> 12:15.635
and "growing up"
that we discussed?

12:15.668 --> 12:18.071
Analytics is not artistry.

12:18.105 --> 12:20.373
Nor is it real life, Kingsley.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.109
(laughs)

12:22.142 --> 12:23.811
Scrap it, all of it.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.246
-You serious?
-TIANA: What?

12:26.279 --> 12:27.781
Start over.

12:27.815 --> 12:30.650
Start ov... over?

12:30.683 --> 12:34.087
BECKY:
I'm gonna round up
some new producers.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.890
I'm sorry.
Managing artistic temperament

12:36.924 --> 12:39.092
really isn't his forte.

12:39.126 --> 12:41.294
-You mean talking to humans?
-Exactly.

12:41.328 --> 12:44.731
Just sit tight. I got you. Just
let me work on him, all right?

12:44.764 --> 12:46.299
Let me see
who else I can drum up.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.601
HAKEEM:
All you got to do is lay back.

12:48.635 --> 12:51.171
-(panting)
-Here you go.

12:51.204 --> 12:55.242
(groans) I don't feel right.
Can you get my doctor?

12:55.275 --> 12:58.011
Oh, it's okay, sweetie.
That's just the contractions.

12:58.045 --> 13:00.814
You're not dilated enough yet,
so sit tight.

13:00.848 --> 13:03.750
I know what I felt.
Hakeem, make them do something.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.585
Nurse, she's high-risk.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.255
NURSE:
There's nothing abnormal here.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.257
(mumbling indistinctly)

13:10.290 --> 13:13.260
-(monitor beeping rapidly)
-Oh! Nurse!

13:13.293 --> 13:14.828
Tee!

13:16.696 --> 13:18.832
OBSTETRICIAN: Prep the OR, stat!
Page Dr. Green!

13:18.866 --> 13:21.001
HAKEEM:
She told everybody!

13:21.034 --> 13:25.105
I'm so tired of people
telling me what's best for me.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.806
Okay, I'm actually the reason

13:26.840 --> 13:28.808
that you're back on Empire's
radar in the first place.

13:28.842 --> 13:30.343
-Take that down some.
-No.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.179
I have kids to provide for.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.848
And you would understand
if you had your own.

13:34.882 --> 13:38.185
(pen clatters on table)

13:38.218 --> 13:42.289
Having children is no excuse
for ignoring label protocol.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.824
Well, look, I didn't make
the rules around here,

13:44.858 --> 13:47.660
so why do I have to follow them?

13:47.694 --> 13:50.030
I'm done sitting tight, Becky.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.532
I'm done.

13:59.039 --> 14:02.375
Hey, baby!
Why don't you get in here

14:02.409 --> 14:03.510
and have some of my world famous

14:03.543 --> 14:07.180
Philly cheesesteak sandwiches?

14:08.548 --> 14:10.050
Uh-oh.
(chuckles)

14:10.083 --> 14:12.185
You only make those
when you're frustrated,

14:12.219 --> 14:13.853
so what's going on, huh?

14:13.887 --> 14:15.989
(Lucious sighs)

14:16.023 --> 14:17.824
Devon.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.193
I'll tell you one thing,
his instrument is amazing.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.529
Technically, his voice
is spot-on, but...

14:22.562 --> 14:24.564
-But?
-He ain't the cure for nothing.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.399
He don't believe in nothing.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.035
You don't believe a thing
coming out of his mouth.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.436
He got no soul.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.871
Okay, well, you better get
his ass all the way together.

14:31.905 --> 14:34.674
Because without him,
the Lyon Family Management

14:34.707 --> 14:36.876
is gonna be dead
before it even started.

14:36.910 --> 14:39.846
You know who could help.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.349
Jamal.
You need to get him over here.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.951
Kai just got home.

14:43.984 --> 14:46.286
-That boy ain't
coming out for days.
-Okay.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.621
That boy need to get his ass
back to work.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.423
You know it and I know it.

14:50.457 --> 14:54.461
Yeah, I know that voice.
What's wrong?

14:59.399 --> 15:01.935
Kai has HIV.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.071
I know.

15:04.104 --> 15:08.408
I almost passed out when I heard
the doctors last night.

15:13.513 --> 15:16.583
-So Jamal...
-No, no, no, no.
Jamal is fine right now.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.586
-(exhales)
-What the hell are we gonna do?

15:20.988 --> 15:23.156
We mind our own damn business.

15:23.190 --> 15:25.158
-What?
-Kai is a grown-ass man

15:25.192 --> 15:29.096
that managed to climb his way
out of a hostile foreign country

15:29.129 --> 15:31.664
without a passport,
without a cell phone...

15:31.698 --> 15:34.467
That's very heroic,
but that ain't got nothing to do

15:34.501 --> 15:36.903
with a disease
that can kill your ass.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.672
What I'm saying
is he's a very determined man.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.976
If he wants to be with Jamal
and Jamal wants to be with him,

15:43.010 --> 15:44.944
there ain't nothing
we can do about it.

15:44.978 --> 15:47.780
I mean, if it's wrong, they'll
pay for it in the next life.

15:47.814 --> 15:50.984
(laughs) Well, look at...
Who am I talking to right now?

15:51.018 --> 15:53.853
Is this, is this Lucious
or is this Dwight?

15:53.886 --> 15:56.289
Hello!
Who is this?

15:56.323 --> 15:58.992
It's me.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.928
Well, I'm not gonna sit by

16:01.961 --> 16:04.664
and watch my son risk his life

16:04.697 --> 16:07.467
because he thinks
he's in love again.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.103
-(scoffs)
-Okay, try and stop him.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.472
You can't tell him
who he gonna be in love with

16:12.505 --> 16:14.207
or who's gonna
be in love with him

16:14.241 --> 16:16.043
or what he gonna do
with his damn life.

16:16.076 --> 16:18.111
I tried it. It don't work.

16:18.145 --> 16:19.146
It's none of our business...

16:24.651 --> 16:27.820
I'm telling you, baby,
leave it alone.

16:39.166 --> 16:42.135
Okay. Silence in the studio.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.671
We doing that good? (chuckles)
What's up, man? I'm Jamal.

16:44.704 --> 16:47.240
-What's up, man?
Nice to meet you.
-Hey. You, too, man.

16:47.274 --> 16:50.177
Trust me, we'll get there.
If he lets us.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.179
(sighs)

16:52.212 --> 16:55.648
Your mom tells me that they
let Kai out of the hospital.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.385
She did, did she?

17:00.920 --> 17:02.889
You taking care of yourself?

17:02.922 --> 17:05.425
(sighs)

17:05.458 --> 17:07.427
Yeah, Dad, I am.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.496
Good. You know,
you're a grown-ass man.

17:09.529 --> 17:13.433
I don't want have to have a
safe sex conversation with you.

17:13.466 --> 17:15.368
Well, I'm a grown-ass man,

17:15.402 --> 17:18.538
and I don't want you to have
a safe sex conversation with me.

17:18.571 --> 17:21.608
(both laugh)

17:21.641 --> 17:23.110
It's just your mama, you know.

17:23.143 --> 17:25.011
She loves you
and she gets worried.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.546
I know.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.949
You know your ass does, too.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.951
(chuckles)

17:31.984 --> 17:35.021
LUCIOUS: Look, maybe you can
help me get this young boy

17:35.054 --> 17:36.956
-where he needs to be.
-(chuckles)

17:36.989 --> 17:38.891
He's got all the talent
in the world,

17:38.925 --> 17:41.361
but he knows too much.

17:41.394 --> 17:44.297
I'm afraid his preview
might end up being his funeral.

17:44.331 --> 17:47.567
(chuckles):
So dramatic, Dad.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.470
There-there has to be some money
we can move around, man.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.739
Something shielded from
the Calhoun wrongful death suit.

17:52.772 --> 17:55.642
Any-Anything will help.

17:55.675 --> 17:59.146
(sighs) I heard you.
I said I heard you!

17:59.179 --> 18:01.514
What, y-you can't understand
English? Thanks for nothing!

18:03.750 --> 18:06.753
Uh, hello?
What did those CDs do to you?

18:06.786 --> 18:09.088
I'm sorry, Ma.

18:09.122 --> 18:11.824
Okay. I'm-a need y'all
to go to lunch.

18:11.858 --> 18:14.060
Take them and go somewhere
and get something to eat.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.095
-We had lunch already.
-Then you know what? Bye-bye.

18:16.129 --> 18:18.831
Y'all go grab a doughnut
and some soda, I don't know.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.300
PORSHA:
Come on, y'all. Let's go.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.802
-Lunch.
-Bye-bye!

18:26.773 --> 18:29.576
I wanted to put money
on the books

18:29.609 --> 18:32.212
for some of the people
that I-I left behind.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.315
-Inside.
-Yeah, okay.

18:35.348 --> 18:38.951
You can't help but feel guilty
for leaving folk behind, baby.

18:38.985 --> 18:41.254
My college friends,

18:41.288 --> 18:43.856
they called them--
called us-- animals.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.658
Well, did you tell
those ignorant asses

18:45.692 --> 18:47.827
that just because
someone makes a mistake,

18:47.860 --> 18:50.096
doesn't make them
less than human?

18:50.129 --> 18:52.765
And what about the people inside
that didn't do a damn thing

18:52.799 --> 18:54.501
but be born black or brown?

18:54.534 --> 18:57.437
You know what? I'm not...
I'm not doing this today.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.038
Can I talk to you, Ma?

18:59.071 --> 19:02.542
I owe you an apology.

19:07.680 --> 19:11.050
Before I went inside,
I didn't get it, either.

19:11.083 --> 19:14.487
When my friends would ask about
you, when you were away, I...

19:14.521 --> 19:17.156
I would change the subject.

19:17.190 --> 19:20.793
And then eventually I just told
people that you were dead.

19:20.827 --> 19:24.564
Now, I told myself that that was
easier for them to accept.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.399
Really, it was
just easier for me.

19:26.433 --> 19:29.135
I'm just glad it was
easier for someone.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.037
I'm sorry, Ma, but I-I love you.
You know I love you...

19:31.070 --> 19:32.972
Look, boy, hey,
it's not about that.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.875
I'm proud of you.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.877
For trying to help.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.046
-It's good stuff.
-Oh, I-I didn't help anybody.

19:40.079 --> 19:43.850
That's the problem. I... I don't
have any money to help anybody.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.685
Oh, Andre.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.220
(chuckles):
Andre. Andre.

19:47.254 --> 19:50.590
If you think
all we have to offer

19:50.623 --> 19:53.192
is money...

19:53.226 --> 19:55.795
then I have truly failed you.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.932
(scoffs softly)

20:04.237 --> 20:06.506
(sighs)

20:06.539 --> 20:08.040
LUCIOUS:
Working with Jamal helped,

20:08.074 --> 20:09.876
but you're still holding back.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.345
Hey, can I get with this
for a minute, bruh?

20:12.379 --> 20:13.613
You good.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.181
Thank you, man.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.785
It's crazy, uh,
this where my girl--

20:18.818 --> 20:21.588
the only one I ever loved--
she broke my heart.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.423
Really?

20:23.456 --> 20:27.193
-My sister told you, didn't she?
-Maybe.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.928
You sneaky, man,
and so is she. I'm-a...

20:28.961 --> 20:30.463
Nah, I'm just trying
to figure out

20:30.497 --> 20:33.032
what the hell happened
to you, man.

20:33.065 --> 20:36.035
If you holding back,
you holding back for a reason.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.637
With a voice like yours,

20:37.670 --> 20:40.206
you should be
a household name, right?

20:40.239 --> 20:42.875
But you're not. You know,
maybe you need to play,

20:42.909 --> 20:44.744
or get off the court.

20:44.777 --> 20:47.747
Either sing or go back
to the junkyard.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.587
All right.

20:54.621 --> 20:57.056
(clears throat)
You want to know what happened?

20:57.089 --> 20:59.826
Look, I made a decision
that she didn't go for.

20:59.859 --> 21:02.261
All right?

21:02.295 --> 21:05.064
To be celibate. Yeah.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.633
I needed to focus
my energy and time

21:06.666 --> 21:08.635
on making my music
and taking care of my family.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.403
I didn't do drugs.

21:10.437 --> 21:13.940
I wasn't out in these streets
partying or wildin' out.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.776
Honestly, if I was,
she'd probably still be here.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.445
It would've made more sense.

21:18.478 --> 21:21.781
That's a bunch of BS, man.
Celibate?

21:21.814 --> 21:23.850
(chuckles)
I knew you was gonna clown me.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.519
-I ain't clowning you, man.
-Nah, you are.

21:26.553 --> 21:30.189
It's just the last thing
I expected to hear from you.

21:30.222 --> 21:33.960
I mean, if you can put
that commitment and discipline

21:33.993 --> 21:36.295
and combine that
with your heart,

21:36.329 --> 21:38.264
that's what makes the difference
between a singer

21:38.297 --> 21:39.966
and a great artist.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.201
I can work with that.

21:42.234 --> 21:43.936
All right. Listen, old man.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.872
I ain't taking it easy on you,
all right?

21:45.905 --> 21:47.640
Yo, talk is cheap, man.

21:47.674 --> 21:50.209
*

21:53.913 --> 21:56.383
If you had the chance
to do it all over again,

21:56.416 --> 21:58.818
would you make the same choices,

21:58.851 --> 22:01.521
or would you do it different?

22:01.554 --> 22:04.457
I would... (sighs)

22:04.491 --> 22:05.892
do it all over again.

22:05.925 --> 22:08.495
I wouldn't change a thing.

22:08.528 --> 22:11.197
(Lucious chuckles softly)

22:11.230 --> 22:13.132
Okay.

22:13.165 --> 22:16.168
I want you to show me
how you would make her stay.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.411
-* We've got time *
-(guitar playing gentle music)

22:24.444 --> 22:27.514
* On our side *

22:27.547 --> 22:32.218
* We don't need
to rush anything tonight *

22:32.251 --> 22:37.223
* I'll just leave
these cards on the table *

22:37.256 --> 22:42.429
* Just so we can be
in the same boat *

22:42.462 --> 22:47.233
* I'll put some respect
right between your legs *

22:47.266 --> 22:50.069
* You got a mind
that I wanna feel *

22:50.102 --> 22:53.606
* And I wanna know
how it makes you feel *

22:53.640 --> 22:57.844
* Can we just love the pace *

22:57.877 --> 22:59.546
* While the whole world's
running *

22:59.579 --> 23:00.547
* So afraid *

23:00.580 --> 23:05.051
* To wait. *

23:06.085 --> 23:08.020
(claps hands)

23:08.054 --> 23:10.389
(laughs)

23:10.423 --> 23:13.259
-I felt that.
-Thank you.

23:13.292 --> 23:16.062
HAKEEM: * Lion in the jungle,
lion in the jungle *

23:16.095 --> 23:19.398
* Rumble, young man,
rumble, young man, rumble *

23:19.432 --> 23:22.569
* I'm a mix of my daddy
and my mama *

23:22.602 --> 23:25.204
* Tryin' to save my baby
from my vices and my karma *

23:25.237 --> 23:26.539
* If you don't respect
my come up *

23:26.573 --> 23:28.274
* Eat you up like
Jeffrey Dahmer *

23:28.307 --> 23:29.809
-Yeah.
-* I'm-a grind to get
my life together *

23:29.842 --> 23:31.277
* Be the greatest,
shine my light forever *

23:31.310 --> 23:32.912
* They wonder where I get
my focus from *

23:32.945 --> 23:34.647
* Well, you ain't never face
a smoking gun *

23:34.681 --> 23:36.983
* I can still see it in my
nightmares, it's endless *

23:37.016 --> 23:38.485
* They want my legacy *

23:38.518 --> 23:39.952
* But what's a prince
without his princess? *

23:39.986 --> 23:41.588
* I'm waking up
in cold sweats, shivering *

23:41.621 --> 23:43.055
* As they coming for
the throne I'm sitting in *

23:43.089 --> 23:44.724
* Blood gushing,
rushing my adrenaline *

23:44.757 --> 23:46.325
* Are these the last seconds
that I'm living in? *

23:46.358 --> 23:48.327
-(music stops)
-Hey!
-Bro.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.229
-That's it right there.
-Bro.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.931
-Drop that joint ASAP.
-(phones vibrating)

23:51.964 --> 23:53.800
Hey, but for real though,
why your boy Blake

23:53.833 --> 23:56.102
blowing up my line
like he one of my side chicks?

23:56.135 --> 23:57.436
He hittin' me up, too.

23:57.470 --> 23:59.939
Apparently, him and Tiana
are about to drop some fire.

23:59.972 --> 24:02.274
-What?
-Uh, Complex is saying

24:02.308 --> 24:04.577
that Tiana surprise-dropped
a new track with Blake.

24:04.611 --> 24:07.113
BLAKE (over speakers): * Oozing,
my body can barely react... *

24:07.146 --> 24:08.815
Wait a minute,
those are my lyrics.

24:08.848 --> 24:10.016
Man, that's the best
homey's ever sounded.

24:10.049 --> 24:11.618
-Watch this.
-(volume increases)

24:11.651 --> 24:12.919
* If they ain't breathing,
I ain't living *

24:12.952 --> 24:14.687
* Can't express
this feeling, praying *

24:14.721 --> 24:16.523
* Give me
one more minute, yeah *

24:16.556 --> 24:19.859
TIANA: * Lost all control
in the blink of an eye... *

24:19.892 --> 24:21.260
I don't know
what to tell you, bro,

24:21.293 --> 24:25.297
but with Tiana on the hook,
it sounds kinda good.

24:25.331 --> 24:27.299
Maybe even too good.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.536
* One more minute *

24:29.569 --> 24:32.004
* Eyes open now,
no, it's not the time *

24:32.038 --> 24:35.374
-* Need to make a choice... *
-(music fades)

24:35.407 --> 24:38.010
QUINCY: I never thought
I'd see you back here, Dre.

24:38.044 --> 24:40.146
ANDRE: Hmm. (chuckles)
Yeah, me neither.

24:40.179 --> 24:41.848
(sighs)

24:41.881 --> 24:44.717
I'm gonna help you
get out of here, Quincy.

24:44.751 --> 24:46.853
-What, you breaking me out?
-Uh, no, nope.

24:46.886 --> 24:48.688
Nothing doing. Absolutely...

24:48.721 --> 24:51.057
(chuckles) I'm gonna help
exonerate you, boy.

24:52.358 --> 24:54.761
Where is this coming from?

24:56.328 --> 24:58.297
-Quincy...
-(door opens)

24:58.330 --> 25:00.299
...you're a good kid.

25:00.332 --> 25:03.069
You deserve to be free
and have a future.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.403
More than I do.

25:04.436 --> 25:07.239
I got to get him back, Andre.
It's late.

25:07.273 --> 25:10.376
-Hey.
-(buzzer blares)

25:10.409 --> 25:13.512
Stay safe. Okay?

25:16.382 --> 25:18.050
-I love you.
-I love you, too, Mom.

25:20.553 --> 25:24.190
Trust Andre.
If he says he can help, he will.

25:24.223 --> 25:26.192
Stay strong, little brother.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.201
TERI:
Well...

25:35.234 --> 25:38.070
can't hurt to have
a Lyon on our side.

25:38.104 --> 25:40.573
And the fact that you were
wrongly convicted, too,

25:40.607 --> 25:43.375
maybe that'll get these lawyers
to finally listen.

25:43.409 --> 25:47.279
Teri, I never claimed
to be innocent.

25:50.116 --> 25:52.084
You killed that woman?

25:52.118 --> 25:55.421
She took everything from me.

25:55.454 --> 25:58.124
She took my-my wife,
she took my child.

25:58.157 --> 26:01.193
You don't, you...
you don't have any regrets,

26:01.227 --> 26:03.395
any-any remorse?

26:03.429 --> 26:04.997
You want me to lie?

26:11.270 --> 26:13.539
Uh, my shift's about to start
at the hospital.

26:13.572 --> 26:16.342
-Teri...
-So I should, um, hmm...

26:18.577 --> 26:22.014
I need to go.
I-I need to go.

26:32.591 --> 26:35.294
* And then you act like
you're doing me a favor *

26:35.327 --> 26:36.896
* I want you to know *

26:36.929 --> 26:41.100
* If you gon' come and go
whenever you want *

26:41.133 --> 26:42.802
* I'd rather be single *

26:42.835 --> 26:45.404
* If I'm-a raise these kids
all on my own... *

26:45.437 --> 26:46.973
That's one of my tracks.

26:47.006 --> 26:48.741
Been reassigned to an artist
who knows how to listen

26:48.775 --> 26:50.576
and doesn't release songs
I killed.

26:50.609 --> 26:53.512
You just said numbers don't lie.
Isn't that your "motto"?

26:53.545 --> 26:54.814
Right now, the numbers say

26:54.847 --> 26:56.348
that you cost my Empire
a pretty penny.

26:56.382 --> 26:59.018
The negotiations for Blake's
rights alone, that's...

26:59.051 --> 27:01.587
Hold on. The free PR she's
generating is gonna offset that.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.489
Okay, get into that with Blake.

27:03.522 --> 27:05.124
Include fees and publishing,

27:05.157 --> 27:06.759
it's coming out of
your overhead.

27:06.793 --> 27:09.328
Which we would have recouped
on your record sales,

27:09.361 --> 27:10.863
but someone decided
to give it away for free.

27:10.897 --> 27:12.832
Kingsley,
you've made your point.

27:12.865 --> 27:15.467
Lucious Lyon may have
tolerated your disrespect.

27:16.669 --> 27:17.837
I will not.

27:19.371 --> 27:21.007
-You're free to go.
-(Tiana scoffs)

27:21.040 --> 27:23.009
I have a priority artist
to tend to.

27:23.042 --> 27:26.312
-Wow.
-* I'd rather be single... *

27:26.345 --> 27:28.848
She'll never be Tiana.
"Priority artist." Hey.

27:30.016 --> 27:32.118
Becky, I'm so over this.

27:32.151 --> 27:35.054
* All on my own,
I'd rather be single. *

27:40.059 --> 27:42.228
-ANDRE: Teri.
-What are you doing here?

27:42.261 --> 27:43.996
You need my help.

27:44.030 --> 27:47.734
Look, Andre, I appreciate you
taking care of my son,

27:47.767 --> 27:50.502
-I do, but...
-But what?

27:50.536 --> 27:52.872
You know what happened to Quincy
in there, how things got better?

27:54.540 --> 27:56.976
You found a way to make
those men stop bothering him.

27:57.009 --> 27:59.245
I didn't just find a way, Teri.

27:59.278 --> 28:01.480
(Teri groans)

28:01.513 --> 28:03.850
When I saw the danger
that he was in,

28:03.883 --> 28:05.517
what they would do to him...

28:08.420 --> 28:11.190
I didn't decide to kill
Anika Calhoun, okay?

28:11.223 --> 28:13.592
I did make a decision
to kill the man

28:13.625 --> 28:15.261
who would've murdered your son.

28:17.263 --> 28:19.932
Now, I may not be the good man
you thought I was.

28:19.966 --> 28:22.568
Teri, I'm the man you need.

28:25.637 --> 28:28.674
I need my son home.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.510
Okay.

28:31.543 --> 28:34.213
Okay. Get...

28:34.246 --> 28:36.248
You're getting wet. Come on.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.389
Can I walk you?

28:43.422 --> 28:46.058
To the end of the block.

28:51.964 --> 28:54.233
DEVON:
* We got time *

28:54.266 --> 28:56.735
* On our side *

28:56.769 --> 29:02.108
* We don't need to rush
anything tonight *

29:02.141 --> 29:07.814
* We got time, we got time *

29:07.847 --> 29:12.518
* We don't need to rush
anything tonight *

29:14.020 --> 29:16.088
* It's more than enough for me *

29:16.122 --> 29:19.125
-* I love making love
to your mind *
-(woman squeals, laughs)

29:19.158 --> 29:23.595
* We can't spend it all
in one night *

29:23.629 --> 29:27.566
* We got time on our side... *

29:27.599 --> 29:30.302
Ain't that your boy up there?

29:30.336 --> 29:34.006
* Anything tonight *

29:34.040 --> 29:35.641
* Can we just love the pace *

29:35.674 --> 29:37.643
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

29:37.676 --> 29:39.678
* While the whole world's
running *

29:39.711 --> 29:44.016
* So afraid to wait. *

29:44.050 --> 29:45.717
-(song ends)
-(crowd cheering)

29:48.888 --> 29:52.691
Let's give it up one more time
for my man, Devon!

29:52.724 --> 29:55.727
-(crowd cheering)
-My man, Devon!

29:57.864 --> 29:59.465
(crowd shouting excitedly)

29:59.498 --> 30:02.534
Now, we know that we're
looking at a future legend

30:02.568 --> 30:04.703
right here on this stage,
it's Devon.

30:04.736 --> 30:06.372
(crowd cheering)

30:06.405 --> 30:08.774
And now I want to welcome
another great songwriter

30:08.807 --> 30:12.278
to this stage, Jamal Lyon!

30:12.311 --> 30:15.147
(crowd cheering)

30:15.181 --> 30:16.415
(whooping)

30:21.520 --> 30:25.291
So, look, thank you.
Love y'all, too. Thanks so much.

30:25.324 --> 30:29.962
Um, over the last week,
I've been reminded a lot

30:29.996 --> 30:32.731
of just how precious
love is, yeah?

30:32.764 --> 30:34.867
-(crowd murmurs in agreement)
-Um, so, brother Devon,

30:34.901 --> 30:38.037
if you don't mind, I'd like
to join you on this song.

30:38.070 --> 30:41.908
I wrote this for my heart,
who's in the crowd.

30:41.941 --> 30:43.309
(crowd awwing)

30:43.342 --> 30:45.044
-I don't need all of that.
-(laughter)

30:45.077 --> 30:46.712
All right?

30:46.745 --> 30:49.481
-So, yeah, let's go.
-(R&B music begins)

30:49.515 --> 30:51.417
(crowd cheering)

30:55.221 --> 30:57.256
* I feel it to my core *

30:59.125 --> 31:03.062
-* Now I know you got me *
-* Yeah *

31:03.095 --> 31:07.266
* A sensation that I know
I can't control *

31:07.299 --> 31:10.102
-* And it's all over my body *
-* Mm, yeah *

31:10.136 --> 31:11.870
* Breathe the fever
that burns in your kiss *

31:11.904 --> 31:15.374
-* And I won't let go *
-* Ooh, yeah *

31:15.407 --> 31:19.111
* No, I won't,
I won't let you go *

31:19.145 --> 31:20.746
(crowd cheering)

31:20.779 --> 31:23.382
* Let the levees break
and flood your love *

31:23.415 --> 31:27.053
* I just wanna heal my pain
with this good *

31:27.086 --> 31:29.121
* Love, love, love,
love, love, love *

31:29.155 --> 31:31.523
* Love, love, love, love *

31:31.557 --> 31:33.392
* Love, love, love,
love, love, love, love *

31:33.425 --> 31:35.194
* Can't you feel it, love? *

31:35.227 --> 31:38.130
* Love, love, love, love, love,
love, love, love, love, love *

31:38.164 --> 31:42.768
* Love, love, love, love, love,
love, love *

31:42.801 --> 31:45.938
* Love is on the brain *

31:45.972 --> 31:48.907
* And that's why
I'm going crazy *

31:48.941 --> 31:50.476
* I feel like
I'm going crazy... *

31:50.509 --> 31:52.211
Can I talk to you?

31:52.244 --> 31:54.880
* Every time that you touch me
slow, so slow *

31:54.913 --> 31:57.083
* Heal the pain of the past
and you don't even know *

31:57.116 --> 31:58.217
* Don't even know *

31:58.250 --> 32:00.786
* Ooh, yeah *

32:00.819 --> 32:03.322
* Let the levees break
and flood your love *

32:03.355 --> 32:04.991
* Let it flood your love *

32:05.024 --> 32:07.593
* Let the water rush in
and carry us *

32:07.626 --> 32:10.997
* I just wanna heal my pain
with this good *

32:11.030 --> 32:14.833
* Love, love, love, love, love,
love, love, love, love, love *

32:14.866 --> 32:17.236
* Love, love, love, love, love,
love, love *

32:17.269 --> 32:19.238
* I need your love, love, love *

32:19.271 --> 32:22.908
* Love, love, love, love, love,
love, love, love, love, love *

32:22.941 --> 32:25.144
* Love, love, love, love, love,
love, love *

32:25.177 --> 32:27.579
* All I need is love, baby *

32:27.613 --> 32:29.515
-* This ain't about you *
-* This ain't about you *

32:29.548 --> 32:31.417
-* This ain't about me *
-* This ain't about me *

32:31.450 --> 32:33.952
* But it's about us
and this L-O-V-E... *

32:33.986 --> 32:35.954
You know, I've never
actually seen him

32:35.988 --> 32:37.323
perform before an audience.

32:37.356 --> 32:39.258
-Mm-hmm.
-(chuckles)

32:39.291 --> 32:40.826
Does-does he always
come alive like this?

32:40.859 --> 32:44.430
(sighs) Look, I know
you say you love my son,

32:44.463 --> 32:46.165
but I can't have him
getting sick.

32:46.198 --> 32:48.867
Cookie, I promise you I won't
ever let that happen to him.

32:48.900 --> 32:51.437
Okay, see, that's a promise
you can't make.

32:51.470 --> 32:54.973
I know what I saw around me
all those years I was locked up.

32:55.007 --> 32:59.145
AIDS making women fade
into a version of themselves

32:59.178 --> 33:01.947
no one could even recognize.

33:01.980 --> 33:06.018
(sighs) I can't let that happen
to my baby.

33:06.052 --> 33:09.988
I'm sorry that
that happened to you, truly.

33:10.022 --> 33:14.393
But I have HIV, Cookie,
not AIDS.

33:14.426 --> 33:16.195
There's a difference.

33:16.228 --> 33:19.865
I am a black, gay man
who's HIV positive.

33:19.898 --> 33:22.501
It took me a long time
to gain the confidence

33:22.534 --> 33:24.970
to say that out loud.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.306
More importantly, I love Jamal.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.141
Almost as much as you do.

33:29.175 --> 33:33.879
And I would never do anything
to jeopardize his health.

33:37.383 --> 33:39.017
(sighs)

33:39.051 --> 33:43.255
I also know that I can't
have my baby destroyed

33:43.289 --> 33:45.824
the way he was
these past few days

33:45.857 --> 33:47.659
just at the thought...

33:47.693 --> 33:49.761
of losing you.

33:49.795 --> 33:52.398
* Love, love, love, love, love,
love, love, love, love, love *

33:52.431 --> 33:54.533
-* I'm in love *
-* Love, love, love... *

33:54.566 --> 33:58.337
Cookie, I promise,

33:58.370 --> 34:02.608
it's gonna take a hell of a lot
more than some stupid virus

34:02.641 --> 34:04.576
for me to leave Jamal.

34:04.610 --> 34:07.679
Trust.

34:07.713 --> 34:10.449
You really do love him,
don't you?

34:10.482 --> 34:11.950
I do.

34:11.983 --> 34:14.720
(sighs)
Come here.

34:14.753 --> 34:16.922
Oh, you're so brave.

34:19.091 --> 34:22.394
-Thank you.
-* L-O-V-E, L-O-V-E. *

34:25.297 --> 34:28.300
-JACKSON: I heard a hit.
-I told you, man.

34:28.334 --> 34:30.769
Lucious, I got to admit,

34:30.802 --> 34:33.239
I almost forgot how much
of a force you and Cookie are.

34:33.272 --> 34:34.873
Ah. Did I hear my name?

34:34.906 --> 34:36.708
LUCIOUS: Yes, you did, baby.
Come on in here.

34:36.742 --> 34:39.911
I was just telling Lucious that
not only do you two create hits,

34:39.945 --> 34:41.947
you literally create stars.

34:41.980 --> 34:45.551
COOKIE: Yeah, well, we're just
getting started with Devon.

34:45.584 --> 34:48.820
I believe that.
I want to sign him.

34:50.956 --> 34:53.659
Wow, well, isn't this lovely?

34:53.692 --> 34:55.594
Very generous of you.

34:55.627 --> 34:57.896
-Yeah.
-But unfortunately, Jackson,

34:57.929 --> 34:59.598
Devon's price just doubled.

34:59.631 --> 35:02.000
Who you trying to play, Lucious?

35:02.033 --> 35:04.703
Well, if you wait any longer,
that number's gonna triple.

35:07.639 --> 35:09.908
I'll have my people
draw up the paperwork,

35:09.941 --> 35:11.277
and send it right over.

35:11.310 --> 35:12.844
(laughs)

35:12.878 --> 35:15.647
Man, I love
doing business with you.

35:15.681 --> 35:17.183
-Hmm.
-Knew you'd be king.

35:17.216 --> 35:18.417
Let's build.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.319
Smart man.

35:21.887 --> 35:23.789
(quietly):
We're really doing this.

35:23.822 --> 35:25.791
It's done.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.359
* Oh, yes, you do *

35:27.393 --> 35:30.262
-(laughs)
-* You took this heart of mine *

35:30.296 --> 35:31.297
* You know you did *

35:31.330 --> 35:34.966
* You'll be my valentine... *

35:35.000 --> 35:36.635
* Said you gave me all you got,
well, it's not enough... *

35:36.668 --> 35:39.338
-Yo, Tiana.
-Oh, hey. What's up?

35:39.371 --> 35:42.040
-What are you doing here?
-I've been trying to reach you
and Keem for days.

35:42.073 --> 35:44.109
How could you drop "One More
Minute" without telling me?

35:44.142 --> 35:45.611
You mean your biggest song ever?

35:45.644 --> 35:47.979
-You're welcome.
-No, that's not the point.

35:48.013 --> 35:49.481
That was supposed to be
just for us.

35:49.515 --> 35:50.716
I know we made this promise,
but, look...

35:50.749 --> 35:52.184
HAKEEM: What's up, bro?
I heard the track.

35:52.218 --> 35:54.720
Yo, about that, about that.

35:54.753 --> 35:56.855
-What? It's dope.
-Told you.

35:56.888 --> 35:59.725
Yo, when I heard
what Blake wrote on that track,

35:59.758 --> 36:01.493
it was just so real,
I had to get on it.

36:01.527 --> 36:04.696
"Blake wrote"? So you told her
you wrote my song, bro?

36:04.730 --> 36:07.566
(sighs) We were just
playing around the studio.

36:07.599 --> 36:09.034
I wasn't even gonna release it.

36:09.067 --> 36:10.536
Look, Keem,
you gave me the track...

36:11.837 --> 36:13.672
-(crowd groans)
-(Hakeem shouts)

36:13.705 --> 36:15.707
Chill out!
Blake, you need to go.

36:15.741 --> 36:18.210
You need some help?
Out of here, man.

36:20.078 --> 36:23.249
Stop! Somebody, do something!

36:23.282 --> 36:26.184
GUARD:
That's enough!

36:26.218 --> 36:27.919
Get off! Hey, man,
what'd I just say?

36:27.953 --> 36:30.356
-Get off!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-All right, all right.

36:30.389 --> 36:32.591
It's my house! It's my house!

36:32.624 --> 36:34.660
-Get off me, man.
-GUARD: Get out. Get him out.

36:34.693 --> 36:37.229
-Man, you got to go.
-Hakeem!

36:37.263 --> 36:40.866
-Hakeem.
-What?

36:40.899 --> 36:43.902
-Aren't you tired of this?
-Yes, I am tired of this.

36:43.935 --> 36:45.337
People coming for me.

36:45.371 --> 36:47.339
Everything and everyone
taking from me, yes.

36:47.373 --> 36:49.174
I'm tired, Tiana.

36:49.207 --> 36:51.410
(fusses quietly)

36:51.443 --> 36:54.246
She's supposed to be here
right next to her brother.

36:59.418 --> 37:02.621
My sincerest apologies
for your loss.

37:02.654 --> 37:04.356
LUCIOUS:
That boy was not supposed to

37:04.390 --> 37:06.024
enter this world
by himself, Doctor.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.093
OBSTETRICIAN:
I know, Mr. Lyon.

37:08.126 --> 37:11.463
And now for the difficult task.

37:11.497 --> 37:14.933
-Would you like
to see your daughter?
-TIANA: No. (sobs softly)

37:14.966 --> 37:18.504
I don't know if I...
if we-if we can...

37:21.473 --> 37:22.908
COOKIE:
Listen, here, sweetheart.

37:22.941 --> 37:25.611
You have to do this, trust me.

37:25.644 --> 37:28.980
You want your last moment
with her.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.150
Okay.

37:32.183 --> 37:34.252
-I'll go with you.
-Okay.

37:48.033 --> 37:50.969
-You did a great job, baby.
-COOKIE: Yes, she did.

(Prince coughs)

38:26.171 --> 38:28.206
(crying softly)

38:28.239 --> 38:31.042
I know it feels like

38:31.076 --> 38:33.211
you're not gonna
make it through this,

38:33.244 --> 38:36.147
but I promise you, son,
you will.

38:36.181 --> 38:41.753
You have to be strong
and protect your family.

38:43.889 --> 38:46.091
You know...

38:47.759 --> 38:51.229
You know, I finally found
the words to express how I felt,

38:51.262 --> 38:53.164
to lose our daughter,

38:53.198 --> 38:55.333
for that punk to take that
from me, too, huh?

38:55.367 --> 38:57.536
-You gave him the song!
-I gave him the song,

38:57.569 --> 38:59.405
but I didn't give him
my girl, did I?

39:00.772 --> 39:03.842
-He obviously wants you, Tee.
-What?

39:03.875 --> 39:05.877
And him copping the pain
from my baby girl like that?

39:05.911 --> 39:07.913
I lost her, too.

39:07.946 --> 39:11.016
Damn it, she was my baby, too.

39:14.586 --> 39:18.056
And not a minute goes by
that I don't think about her.

39:20.058 --> 39:22.561
But I have to be there
for Bella and Prince.

39:22.594 --> 39:25.263
What you've been doing
and how you've been acting

39:25.296 --> 39:29.935
since we lost her is not fair,
to them or to me.

39:32.237 --> 39:33.672
-Come on...
-I love you,

39:33.705 --> 39:37.543
but I... I won't
do this anymore.

39:39.077 --> 39:42.213
-I can't.
-Tee.

39:42.247 --> 39:45.216
I'm done.

39:45.250 --> 39:47.953
Tiana!

39:47.986 --> 39:49.988
Tee.

39:53.224 --> 39:55.226
(crying softly)

40:20.819 --> 40:22.287
Why'd you bounce?

40:22.320 --> 40:24.723
Uh...

40:24.756 --> 40:27.325
your mother and I
were discussing my status.

40:27.358 --> 40:29.895
Kai, babe, um,
please charge any ignorant stuff

40:29.928 --> 40:32.498
that my mom said to her head,
not her heart, you know?

40:32.531 --> 40:35.433
I have never met a mother
so fiercely protective

40:35.467 --> 40:37.068
about her middle child.
(laughs)

40:37.102 --> 40:39.270
-You know what?
-I'm just saying.

40:41.006 --> 40:43.909
Cookie's not to be trifled with
when it comes to you.

40:43.942 --> 40:46.011
And, uh, it, uh,

40:46.044 --> 40:48.279
it got me thinking about
how protective I feel about you.

40:48.313 --> 40:51.149
I don't want to lose you, Jamal.

40:51.182 --> 40:53.985
You won't. Ever.

40:54.019 --> 40:56.788
I hope so.

41:16.708 --> 41:21.980
will you do me the honor
of becoming my husband?

41:23.515 --> 41:25.951
(chuckles)

41:25.984 --> 41:29.821
When'd you have time
to get a ring?

41:32.023 --> 41:35.260
The moment I got out
of the hospital.

41:40.599 --> 41:43.034
You stole my move.

41:48.940 --> 41:51.342
(sighs)

42:05.190 --> 42:07.158

-No, no, you stay down.

42:09.260 --> 42:11.062
-You just, you...
-Okay, my bad. Okay, okay.

42:11.096 --> 42:13.164
(laughing):
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Kai Eugene Givens,

42:22.040 --> 42:26.612
you're my lover
and you're my best friend.

42:28.647 --> 42:31.316
You're my only reason why.

42:32.984 --> 42:37.455
So now I'm begging you
from the bottom of my heart

42:37.488 --> 42:40.558
to please marry me.

42:40.592 --> 42:43.061
Uh, well...

42:43.094 --> 42:46.397
it-it depends if...

42:46.431 --> 42:48.700
that's a yes or no
for my proposal.

42:48.734 --> 42:50.736
(both laugh)

42:50.769 --> 42:52.804
Hell yeah.

42:52.838 --> 42:54.072
Of course I'll marry you.

42:54.105 --> 42:56.274
-Wait.
