00:37.604 --> 00:39.902
This, my friends, is New York City,

00:39.973 --> 00:41.873
the most populous city
in the United States.

00:42.342 --> 00:44.367
8.2 million people,

00:44.444 --> 00:47.641
4. 72 million of which are married.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.410
One of which is not me. Why?

00:50.483 --> 00:53.782
Because it's New York City and I own a bar,

00:53.853 --> 00:56.583
which is sort of like being, you know,
my own episode of The Bachelor.

00:58.391 --> 00:59.881
Now there is my brother- in- law Paul.

00:59.959 --> 01:03.395
That look on his face is called
"Married, lost and how did I get here?"

01:03.463 --> 01:04.555
Sorry. Hell- 

01:04.631 --> 01:07.191
And that guy right there,
that handsome kid, that's me, Mike.

01:07.267 --> 01:08.734
Why do my friends come to me for advice?

01:08.802 --> 01:11.703
Because when you're this single,
trust me, you've seen it all.

01:11.771 --> 01:12.829
I'll get a hotel.

01:13.440 --> 01:16.500
What? No, come in. This is Amy.

01:16.576 --> 01:17.634
Laura.

01:18.745 --> 01:19.939
I gotta crash for the night.

01:20.580 --> 01:21.740
For sure. Come on.

01:22.282 --> 01:23.806
- You okay?
- I don't know.

01:26.453 --> 01:27.442
I hate to say it,

01:27.520 --> 01:29.351
but the second
some men put on a wedding ring,

01:29.422 --> 01:31.982
it cuts off all circulation to the brain.

01:32.859 --> 01:36.192
It's like... He pretends to listen,

01:36.262 --> 01:38.696
but then I could literally quiz him

01:38.765 --> 01:41.928
about what I just said
and he would have no idea.

01:42.001 --> 01:45.437
Well, I'm not good at taking tests, okay,
that's a real thing. You can google it.

01:45.505 --> 01:46.631
I don't have to, Paul.

01:46.706 --> 01:48.105
Well, you should, because it's real.

01:48.174 --> 01:51.769
There are three paths
to a healthy relationship.

01:51.845 --> 01:54.507
There's the path she's on,
which you need to respect,

01:54.581 --> 01:55.707
and then there's you, yourself...

01:55.782 --> 01:57.215
Okay, well, here's the problem.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.046
I don't know what my path is. Okay?

01:59.119 --> 02:02.816
I lost sight of what my path was or is
or where it was going.

02:02.889 --> 02:04.789
- I've been path- fucked.
- Wow! See?

02:04.858 --> 02:06.257
Okay, this is what I'm talking about.

02:06.326 --> 02:08.191
- Who says that?
- I do.

02:08.261 --> 02:11.162
There are these things
that should stay inside your head,

02:11.231 --> 02:14.359
but instead they keep coming out
into the outside world.

02:14.434 --> 02:16.994
Oh, my God, well, we're in therapy
so I figured, you know, call me crazy,

02:17.070 --> 02:19.800
I could speak my mind,
but I guess I can't. I should be censored.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.568
Do you have a gag for me? Okay?

02:21.641 --> 02:23.472
You wanna hear
what really goes on with me?

02:23.543 --> 02:26.307
You wanna know my inside voice?
If I may? If I'm allowed to?

02:26.379 --> 02:28.904
My business is down 25%, okay?

02:28.982 --> 02:30.973
I know, it's not your
problem, I understand.

02:31.050 --> 02:35.043
It doesn't stop her spending like wildfire,
which I'd like to get to in a second.

02:35.121 --> 02:37.681
But here's the bottom line.
I sent my daughter to private school.

02:37.757 --> 02:39.952
I'll pay for that, I get it.
Education is important.

02:40.493 --> 02:44.725
But now I have to pay for singing lessons,
piano and dance!

02:44.797 --> 02:45.786
And you know why?

02:45.865 --> 02:48.299
Because apparently
my daughter is going to be the next Idol,

02:48.368 --> 02:51.860
- or Voice or Duets at $1,600 a month!
- We should nurture her gift.

02:51.938 --> 02:53.929
- Nurture? We're not the Jackson 5!
- It is rare...

02:54.007 --> 02:56.032
Okay, time out, time out! Time out.

02:56.509 --> 02:57.498
Take a breath.

02:59.145 --> 03:00.635
You, too, Paul.

03:02.682 --> 03:06.482
Good. I hear your financial concerns, Paul,
I really do.

03:06.553 --> 03:08.953
And I hear you wanting to be heard.

03:10.056 --> 03:11.751
I think you're making great progress,

03:11.824 --> 03:15.385
so we'll just take up where we left off
next week at this time.

03:15.461 --> 03:16.894
Okay, well, just give me 30 more seconds,

03:16.963 --> 03:19.864
because I want to finish the point
I started with in the beginning.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.470
I'm sorry.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.237
It doesn't work that way.

03:27.307 --> 03:29.070
See the secretary on the way out,

03:29.142 --> 03:31.007
and just stay positive all week,

03:31.077 --> 03:34.012
and really... I'm really pleased.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.207
Okay. Well, that's good news.

03:36.282 --> 03:38.443
All that laughing and all that stuff.

03:38.518 --> 03:40.145
I could have gotten to the fifth path.

03:40.353 --> 03:42.947
Well, fortunately for you,
there's only three paths.

03:43.022 --> 03:44.114
Just three. Three.

03:44.524 --> 03:46.890
There's hers. Yours.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.785
And yours and hers, together.

03:51.130 --> 03:53.291
Now, Paul's not the only one
who needs help.

03:54.334 --> 03:57.303
Meet Marty,
Paul's business partner and my good friend.

03:58.338 --> 03:59.896
Did you make sure
Alex got his chips in the bag?

04:00.707 --> 04:02.868
He's the CEO of a large marketing company.

04:02.942 --> 04:04.432
A big- shot in the business world,

04:04.510 --> 04:07.673
but at home,
he's just another schmuck making PB&J.

04:08.615 --> 04:10.708
He's all chipped up. What are you doing?

04:11.150 --> 04:13.141
- And his Fruit Roll- Up?
- All rolled up.

04:13.219 --> 04:14.481
We got all the food groups.

04:14.554 --> 04:17.990
I got the fruit group, the bread group
and the peanut butter group. He's all set.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.689
Marty, my family wanted
to have dinner with us later.

04:21.761 --> 04:24.161
So if you could make that happen,
that'd be great.

04:24.230 --> 04:26.858
No, well, I got a hockey game, sweets.

04:27.867 --> 04:30.062
So now hockey's more important than
dinner with my family?

04:30.136 --> 04:32.297
No, I didn't say that,
it's just that the team needs me.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.095
I wish they didn't, but they do.

04:34.173 --> 04:35.606
I mean, the squad can't win without me.

04:36.075 --> 04:37.702
Yeah. Okay. Well.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.904
Maybe after the scouts see you
then you'll have some free time.

04:39.979 --> 04:41.537
Yeah, well, you know
there was a time when I thought

04:41.614 --> 04:43.047
the pro scouts would be calling.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.380
And there was a time that
I thought I'd be 5'9".

04:45.451 --> 04:47.180
Don't think I didn't notice
you skipping out on the jelly

04:47.253 --> 04:49.084
on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

04:49.155 --> 04:50.747
Taking lazy to a whole new level.

04:50.957 --> 04:54.324
No, no. It's just that
Alex's taste buds are changing,

04:54.394 --> 04:55.616
he doesn't love jelly
as much as he used to.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.862
Yeah, he told
you that?

04:57.063 --> 04:58.553
- Who?
- Excuse me?

04:58.931 --> 05:01.798
Fine, but it happens to boys.
You know, it happened to me.

05:01.868 --> 05:03.426
I went through a heavy gefilte fish phase.

05:03.770 --> 05:05.465
I used to hate it, now I love it.

05:05.538 --> 05:07.438
Marty, jelly. Please.

05:19.786 --> 05:21.845
I wrote a song. Do you want to hear it?

05:22.088 --> 05:23.521
- Now?
- Yeah.

05:23.589 --> 05:27.184
It's about getting roofied
and waking up not that upset.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.251
I know it's a weird topic, but...

05:30.563 --> 05:32.030
You can't write a great song without pain.

05:32.098 --> 05:33.827
Well, that's not necessarily true.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.733
I mean,
Madonna came from an upper- class family,

05:36.803 --> 05:39.465
McCartney had a very good relationship
with his father,

05:39.539 --> 05:42.474
and Alice Cooper, nice Jewish boy,
likes to play golf.

05:42.542 --> 05:44.737
- Golf is a...
- Shut up. Just listen, okay?

05:46.546 --> 05:49.947
Sleeping through sex
Wasn't as bad as I thought

05:50.016 --> 05:53.042
He took me like a criminal
And I was caught

05:53.119 --> 05:57.180
I'm asleep yet happy
Unconscious, not sad

05:57.256 --> 06:00.248
Life can be happy
Don't have to be sad

06:00.326 --> 06:02.453
So somebody call the cops

06:02.729 --> 06:03.753
Or not

06:03.830 --> 06:06.025
Very melodic. I like the
words, the rhyme...

06:06.566 --> 06:10.002
Prostitution is a viable option

06:10.069 --> 06:12.833
As I ponder my thoughts

06:12.905 --> 06:16.602
Go deep into my psyche
Do I really like me?

06:16.776 --> 06:20.439
Fuck the world as it stands today!

06:21.681 --> 06:23.774
You have a gift. You have a gift.

06:24.283 --> 06:25.682
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:25.752 --> 06:27.310
Do you think you can get me a record deal?

06:27.620 --> 06:30.817
Record deal?
Who does she think she's fucking? CeeLo?

06:32.358 --> 06:34.849
- It's fucking hockey, not hopscotch, buddy!
- Wheel! Wheel!

06:34.927 --> 06:36.827
Man, your sister's killing me.
She thinks I don't care.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.830
She's got no idea
how much is on my mind right now.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.230
See, you guys have like a combo platter
going right now.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.700
You both care, but, you know, not enough.
You gotta up the care.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.533
Give her a little attention.
It's that simple.

06:45.605 --> 06:46.799
Yeah, up the care? What do you know?

06:46.873 --> 06:48.363
You haven't been in a relationship
in over three years.

06:48.441 --> 06:49.965
Yeah. That's what makes me an expert.

06:50.042 --> 06:52.442
While you were getting married to
my sister, losing half your manhood,

06:52.512 --> 06:54.309
I've been in trenches
dating women of every culture.

06:54.380 --> 06:55.847
Banging here and there.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.008
- Can't believe you never got an STD.
- STD.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.279
Listen, when you fuck Guatemalan twins

07:00.353 --> 07:03.447
in 10- degree weather without a shirt,
a cold doesn't stand a chance.

07:03.523 --> 07:05.753
- My immune system's on steroids.
- Did you really do that?

07:05.825 --> 07:07.349
Yeah. I showed you the pictures.

07:09.762 --> 07:12.322
- This guy doesn't hustle! Hustle, please!
- What have you got?

07:12.398 --> 07:15.424
Hey listen to this, Lianne tried to get me
to a parent's dinner the other night.

07:15.501 --> 07:17.162
I felt bad, but I just couldn't stomach it.

07:17.236 --> 07:18.908
Marty, it's getting
embarrassing for all of us.

07:18.921 --> 07:20.603
Grow a fucking
backbone!

07:20.973 --> 07:22.634
You know what,
you give in to a parents‘ dinner,

07:22.708 --> 07:24.266
next thing you know
she's resting a drink on your head

07:24.343 --> 07:25.332
and you're giving her a foot rub.

07:25.411 --> 07:27.902
She's going to need a foot rub with
all the working out she's doing.

07:28.214 --> 07:29.511
She's like the Jewish Flojo.

07:29.582 --> 07:30.913
You know what it is with you?

07:31.017 --> 07:33.349
You lost your...
You were a cool kid, you know that?

07:33.419 --> 07:35.284
It's your fucking walk. That's what it is.

07:35.354 --> 07:38.016
- What's wrong with my walk?
- It's like you're falling all the time.

07:38.357 --> 07:40.018
- So, sometimes I feel like I'm falling.
- Yeah.

07:40.092 --> 07:42.117
You know what I do?
I put a song in my head like...

07:42.195 --> 07:43.719
Like The Stones, Sympathy for The Devil.

07:43.796 --> 07:47.095
Or if I'm trying to appeal
to a kind of a cooler crowd,

07:47.166 --> 07:48.565
Jay- Z, 99 Problems.

07:49.068 --> 07:50.467
Okay, yeah. I like Jigga Man.

07:50.536 --> 07:51.525
- Yeah.
- All right.

07:52.104 --> 07:53.833
- Get out there and score.
- All right.

07:55.107 --> 07:56.631
- Go.
- So I take this girl on a date,

07:56.709 --> 07:59.576
and the first thing out of her mouth is,
what are my intentions?

07:59.645 --> 08:01.078
- What the...
- End it.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.341
- But it just started.
- End it!

08:02.415 --> 08:04.042
If it starts that fast,
it's gonna end that fast.

08:04.116 --> 08:06.744
And you be the one to do it.
I don't need a broken- hearted center.

08:06.819 --> 08:09.117
- Peter, get the fuck out there. Go.
- Come on! Let's go, blues!

08:09.188 --> 08:10.177
What've you got for us?

08:24.437 --> 08:25.734
Nobody's happy.

08:25.805 --> 08:28.706
Life is an illusion,
and part of life is to be unhappy.

08:28.774 --> 08:30.435
- It's all a struggle.
- What the...

08:30.510 --> 08:32.273
I'm telling you, it's all
about fighting gravity.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.607
Hey, Marty, it is what it is.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.273
No, you can say it is what it is,
but it's just not!

08:36.349 --> 08:39.044
Not with me.
I'm confused. I'm overwhelmed.

08:39.118 --> 08:42.019
I'm overburdened. I'm slightly overweight.

08:42.087 --> 08:44.022
Like now, but I just don't know...

08:44.824 --> 08:46.257
Hey boys. How are you?

08:46.325 --> 08:47.622
- Hey.
- We're losers.

08:47.727 --> 08:48.716
Tough loss today?

08:48.794 --> 08:50.785
No, our wives think we're losers.
Our team likes us.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.555
Guys, don't beat yourselves up.
You must be doing something right.

08:53.633 --> 08:56.568
And to be honest, you both married up.

08:58.137 --> 08:59.502
- What does that mean?
- Is that good?

08:59.805 --> 09:01.864
No, it's not good.
It means your wives are better than you.

09:03.042 --> 09:05.840
Clarissa, can you see
all those patrons staring into space

09:05.912 --> 09:07.379
wishing they had alcohol?

09:07.446 --> 09:10.210
Fine, boss, but actually I
just came here to let you know

09:10.283 --> 09:13.275
the building landlord called and you should
call him as soon as possible.

09:13.352 --> 09:15.047
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:15.421 --> 09:17.150
- Bye, guys.
- Later.

09:17.924 --> 09:18.948
Bye.

09:20.693 --> 09:22.490
She's so hot!

09:22.562 --> 09:25.793
She's so beautiful, she's so sexy,
she makes my stomach sick.

09:25.865 --> 09:27.890
I mean, she throws me off balance
just looking at her.

09:27.967 --> 09:29.059
It confuses me.

09:29.135 --> 09:32.002
- In my head, I just slept with her twice.
- Me, too.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.698
What was she wearing in your fantasy?

09:33.773 --> 09:35.365
Coconut oil and a smile.

09:35.441 --> 09:36.999
That's cool. We were married in mine.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.668
And we had a little dog, like a poodle.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.041
Guys, stop it. She's my bartender.

09:40.112 --> 09:42.808
I don't care who she is,
I'll fight you for her right now, okay?

09:43.115 --> 09:46.482
I just want to swoop her up on a horse
and ride off into the sunset.

09:46.652 --> 09:47.846
And just have a bunch of babies,

09:47.920 --> 09:50.889
caramel- colored babies that scurry around.

09:50.957 --> 09:54.688
The kind of kids that look like
Halle Berry fucked a bar of gold.

09:55.127 --> 09:57.061
What does that... I don't even know...
What does that mean?

09:57.129 --> 09:59.620
- A what?
- I don't know. Who cares?

10:00.266 --> 10:02.131
I'm sorry, were you talking about me?

10:04.170 --> 10:08.266
- Yes, no.
- Paul, I love gold bars.

10:13.813 --> 10:15.144
He fucked her in the Goldbar!

10:15.314 --> 10:16.303
You were right, Mike.

10:16.382 --> 10:18.850
Vanessa, I told you.
Once a cheater, always a cheater.

10:19.051 --> 10:21.576
Well, you're the best. Seriously.
Thank you.

10:21.654 --> 10:22.848
You're my hero.

10:24.924 --> 10:28.087
- "My hero"?
- What are you, a fireman?

10:28.160 --> 10:30.185
"My hero"? Unbelievable!

10:30.262 --> 10:33.231
I can't get the one woman I love
to love me back,

10:33.299 --> 10:35.290
and this guy's
the goddamn Pied Piper of pussy.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.097
- It's incredible.
- It's a blessing and a curse.

10:37.169 --> 10:40.332
You're like a real cocksmith! No,
fuck you with the blessing and the curse.

10:40.406 --> 10:43.864
Fuck your hair. Fuck your blue eyes.
And fuck your fucking jawline.

10:43.943 --> 10:45.274
Guys, I'm just as God made me.

10:45.378 --> 10:46.936
- Yeah, well...
- Punch him in the face for that.

10:47.013 --> 10:49.914
Yeah, I'm gonna fucking twist your nose up
and fuck your whole program up.

10:51.050 --> 10:52.642
What's this? I asked for a dog!

10:52.718 --> 10:56.484
Now, see, Married Saturday is the
complete opposite of Single Saturday.

10:56.555 --> 10:59.183
Mine comes with a 26 year
old stripper turned folk singer,

10:59.258 --> 11:02.193
and theirs comes with kids, neighbors
and the pressure to make small talk.

11:02.261 --> 11:03.956
I asked for a lightning bolt!

11:04.363 --> 11:05.762
Why don't you go cry to your mama?

11:05.831 --> 11:07.958
Fuck you. I don't have one.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.595
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.695
It's going good, Sweets.

11:12.772 --> 11:14.535
- It's good, isn't it? You forgot something!
- Yeah.

11:14.607 --> 11:16.074
- What?
- Film the party.

11:16.142 --> 11:18.235
- Okay. I will film it.
- He's gonna film it.

11:18.310 --> 11:20.073
- I will do that.
- I'll supervise.

11:20.146 --> 11:22.376
- Okay, Paul.
- There it is. Two- fisted, baby.

11:22.448 --> 11:24.006
Getting something for your wife.

11:24.083 --> 11:25.380
- Good stuff. Oh, look!
- Okay.

11:25.451 --> 11:28.147
My wife, Liz, is giving me
the international sign to mingle.

11:28.220 --> 11:31.087
- So we better mingle. Okay. There it is.
- Yeah. Yep.

11:31.157 --> 11:33.990
All right, this is what 40 looks like,
ladies and gentlemen.

11:34.060 --> 11:38.258
Face paint. Liquor out of a plastic cup
and couples therapy.

11:38.330 --> 11:41.163
Yeah, and grown men making sandwiches
while their wives work out.

11:41.233 --> 11:43.224
I'm telling you,
Lianne only works out that much

11:43.302 --> 11:45.202
so when I die she looks good single.

11:45.271 --> 11:46.636
She's getting into funeral shape.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.571
Let me explain something to you, my friend,
and listen to me.

11:48.641 --> 11:51.166
We sell this company,
and you can buy yourself your own gym

11:51.243 --> 11:53.370
and you can hire Lianne as
your personal trainer.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.176
I hope. I hope.
Oh, my goodness, look at Danny.

11:56.649 --> 11:59.243
All right, everybody take note.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.653
I'm going to break open the neck area,

12:02.722 --> 12:04.280
get things rolling around here.

12:04.957 --> 12:06.982
Jesus, he's not in a good way.

12:07.059 --> 12:09.391
The divorce has pushed him over the edge.
Look at this guy!

12:09.929 --> 12:11.453
Hey, Marty, Paul, get over here.
Help me out.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.656
- All right, Danny.
- Okay.

12:13.733 --> 12:14.995
He's got a piata?

12:15.067 --> 12:17.797
Come on, each of you grab an end.
Let's go. Let's go.

12:17.870 --> 12:19.804
Maybe let's let the kids
start off with the first hit.

12:19.872 --> 12:20.861
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

12:21.173 --> 12:23.198
Why don't you go back to
making sandwiches, Marty?

12:23.275 --> 12:25.436
- Everybody knows.
- Knows what?

12:25.511 --> 12:27.274
I don't mind making sandwiches.

12:27.346 --> 12:30.315
Yeah, and I don't mind listening to
Barry Manilow and blowing dudes.

12:30.416 --> 12:31.940
Dude, just watch your language,
please, with the kids.

12:32.017 --> 12:33.348
- Fuck that!
- Jesus.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.649
Man up! Both of you!

12:35.721 --> 12:37.313
Shit, man, I like Barry Manilow.

12:37.389 --> 12:39.357
He's cool,
and he's got the best hair in the business.

12:39.458 --> 12:41.153
You sure you don't want to
let the kids take a crack?

12:41.227 --> 12:44.253
- You're going to obliterate this thing?
- Yeah. I'm pretty sure.

12:44.396 --> 12:47.854
Now listen up, my ex- wife made this thing.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.423
She's half Mexican.

12:49.502 --> 12:51.629
This little donkey is made of concrete.

12:51.837 --> 12:54.704
These little drunk midgets
couldn't knock the balls off this thing.

12:55.808 --> 12:58.606
So here we go. Raise it up!

12:58.677 --> 12:59.666
- All right.
- All right.

13:00.479 --> 13:01.810
Where are you going to hit?

13:01.881 --> 13:05.339
- Would you just... Just stop talking, man!
- All right, okay.

13:06.152 --> 13:07.141
Cover your eyes, kids.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.616
Go, Danny, please. Be careful.

13:16.128 --> 13:17.459
Come on! Do it!

13:18.397 --> 13:20.160
Man, I can't do it.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.061
- What?
- The thing is staring at me, man.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.625
- What?
- Look at this thing.

13:25.871 --> 13:27.236
It's some kind of...

13:27.306 --> 13:29.866
These beautiful little eyes and its tail.

13:29.942 --> 13:31.910
She put so much detail into it, you know?

13:32.378 --> 13:35.006
All right, you gotta get
a soda or something.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.571
Take the bat, Marty. Give the bat to Marty.

13:38.250 --> 13:39.649
Give me the bat, Danny.

13:39.718 --> 13:42.881
- There you go. - Come on, kids!
It is time for a talent show!

13:42.955 --> 13:44.889
- Let's go inside for the talent show.
- Talent show!

13:44.957 --> 13:48.449
Who wants to sing?
Alex, I bet you have a song!

13:48.794 --> 13:51.058
How ‘bout this one? My dad loves it.

13:53.032 --> 13:54.795
I told this bitch I was one...

13:57.269 --> 14:02.104
Talent show! This way. Come on, kids!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

14:05.711 --> 14:08.373
Okay. Australians‘ lawyer.
Hold my drink. Say a prayer.

14:08.447 --> 14:10.210
- Be good. Be good.
- Hello?

14:10.816 --> 14:12.909
Yes. How are you?

14:16.188 --> 14:18.679
That sounds great. That's great news.

14:18.757 --> 14:21.624
We will not be late.

14:22.328 --> 14:24.796
Okay. Same to you.

14:24.864 --> 14:28.163
Friday. Yes, sir. Bye.

14:28.234 --> 14:30.065
- Meeting?
- "Meeting"?

14:30.135 --> 14:31.830
Well, don't get too
excited, but guess what?

14:31.904 --> 14:33.997
The Australians took a good hard look
at our numbers,

14:34.073 --> 14:35.768
they want to meet with us on Friday.
Are you free then?

14:35.841 --> 14:38.537
Yes, I'm free. I'm really free.
Good, good, good, good.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.205
- Don't get excited. Just stay calm.
- Okay.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.406
Marty!

14:42.681 --> 14:44.273
Getting some good footage?

14:44.617 --> 14:47.211
Yes. Yes. I'm videotaping everything.

14:47.686 --> 14:49.654
Good news for Marty Martin and Paul Gold,

14:49.722 --> 14:52.919
digital marketing pioneers
and co- founders of Goldbam.

14:53.025 --> 14:56.358
Rumor has it
Australian ad tech giant Ignition One

14:56.428 --> 14:59.056
is looking to purchase Goldbam
for an undisclosed sum.

14:59.398 --> 15:02.492
You may remember Goldbam as
the brains behind the marketing campaigns

15:02.568 --> 15:05.002
for both AmeriMerchant and Netmining,

15:05.070 --> 15:08.938
two companies that became industry
behemoths after Goldbam got involved.

15:09.008 --> 15:11.374
Martin and Gold, real power players.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.672
- Look at my girls! Good morning!
- Perfect. Hello.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.649
Don't bother waiting up.
I got a meeting with the Australians

15:18.717 --> 15:20.014
and I got drinks with the boys.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.952
Tonight is parent- teacher
conferences, Paul. Remember?

15:23.455 --> 15:24.513
- Tonight?
- Tonight.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.579
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.091
Yeah. "Parent."

15:27.159 --> 15:29.457
"Parents," I think that's too overwhelming.

15:29.528 --> 15:32.053
I think the two of us as a team
put out too much power

15:32.131 --> 15:34.099
and change the whole situation in the room.

15:34.166 --> 15:36.031
Besides, I happen to know for a fact that

15:36.101 --> 15:38.626
my daughter is dominating the third grade.

15:38.704 --> 15:41.172
- Fourth grade.
- She's in fourth grade.

15:42.141 --> 15:44.336
- Fourth grade.
- Yeah. I know.

15:45.110 --> 15:48.011
But you know,
I like to keep her younger in my head

15:48.080 --> 15:51.140
because she will always be my baby.

15:51.483 --> 15:53.644
And I love you. Bye.

15:53.719 --> 15:56.017
Next week, piano recital.
Please don't forget.

15:56.088 --> 15:58.283
Piano. Yeah, duh. Practice.

16:06.265 --> 16:07.391
Hey- 

16:07.466 --> 16:11.425
Wow, girls must love coming here.
They get laid and a free shirt.

16:11.503 --> 16:13.334
- She's got something.
- Yeah, your wardrobe.

16:13.405 --> 16:14.429
Funny.

16:14.506 --> 16:16.201
Here are the keys.
Did you get the beverage numbers?

16:16.275 --> 16:17.264
- Yeah, you're all good.
- Good.

16:17.343 --> 16:20.904
20- somethings leaving your place
with your clothes during the day?

16:20.980 --> 16:22.038
You need a girlfriend.

16:22.114 --> 16:24.605
- A girlfriend's the last thing I need.
- If you say so.

16:27.119 --> 16:29.417
Okay, now, less is more, right?
Less is more.

16:29.488 --> 16:31.422
- Don't be frenetic, don't over- explain.
- Okay.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.754
Stay focused.
They know exactly what we're about.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.555
- We got this.
- I feel good. Are you sure?

16:35.627 --> 16:37.925
Are you positive? ‘Cause
these Australians are a different breed.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.521
They're into a different
kind of animal here.

16:39.598 --> 16:41.065
Hey, I don't care what they're into.

16:41.133 --> 16:42.794
- You trust me on this, all right?
- Okay.

16:42.868 --> 16:45.302
What is Parchment doing here?
Why are they here?

16:45.371 --> 16:48.431
I mean, the Australians can't be buying out
two companies. What are they doing here?

16:48.507 --> 16:49.997
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

16:50.075 --> 16:51.940
- Let's go do this. We're better than them.
- Okay.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.502
- Okay. I'm ready.
- Button your jacket. Button your jacket.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.707
We're more prepared, and we're better.

16:56.782 --> 16:58.272
What time is it? It's game time!

16:58.350 --> 16:59.840
Parchment showing up, kiss my ass.

17:01.653 --> 17:04.645
I don't think
they have the capacity to improve.

17:04.723 --> 17:05.916
They've maxed it out.

17:05.991 --> 17:07.083
I swear, I look at Paul,

17:07.159 --> 17:09.491
and sometimes
I love him like the day we were married

17:09.560 --> 17:12.496
and other times
I have the exact opposite thought.

17:12.564 --> 17:14.555
- I know.
- What can you do?

17:15.334 --> 17:18.098
Lower your expectations,
more daytime drinking.

17:18.170 --> 17:20.400
Mid- week masturbation,
do it on a Wednesday.

17:20.472 --> 17:22.804
- It takes you through to Friday.
- Really?

17:22.875 --> 17:25.105
I hit Paul with AmEx sex the other night.

17:25.176 --> 17:27.974
AmEx sex? What is that?

17:28.446 --> 17:30.074
Is that where you hang off the bed

17:30.149 --> 17:32.208
and blood rushes to your head
and he chokes you a little bit,

17:32.284 --> 17:34.218
- and right before you pass out...
- No!

17:34.787 --> 17:37.915
- It isn't?
- When the AmEx bill comes, I hide it.

17:37.990 --> 17:40.356
Blow him till his eyes
roll back in his head.

17:40.426 --> 17:43.623
The next day he's so happy,
he doesn't even bring up the charges.

17:43.695 --> 17:45.287
Does that make me a bad person?

17:45.364 --> 17:48.060
No. That makes you a goddamn magician.

17:49.101 --> 17:51.899
See, loud music and women are
a married man's kryptonite.

17:51.970 --> 17:53.835
They just, they don't have the
skill set to deal with it.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.773
Married men in a club
are like six- year- olds in a toy store,

17:56.842 --> 17:58.673
and they can't focus,
they just want to touch everything.

18:02.147 --> 18:04.240
All right guys, hey... I love you guys.

18:04.316 --> 18:06.580
- I love that.
- Here it is, huh?

18:06.652 --> 18:09.246
Hey ladies, do you want to join us
for some good, clean fun?

18:09.321 --> 18:11.312
What do you mean, ''clean fun"?
Who are you, Mister Rogers?

18:11.390 --> 18:13.051
Girls don't want clean fun.

18:13.125 --> 18:15.525
Half these girls in this place
are going to walk home barefoot tonight.

18:15.594 --> 18:18.256
They want it dirty.
They like it edgy. Not clean.

18:18.330 --> 18:19.319
okay...

18:19.398 --> 18:21.628
Hey, listen, I gotta go talk to this DJ.

18:21.700 --> 18:24.191
I can't stand this music.
It's making me loopy, you know.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.794
- I'm gonna go talk to this guy.
- You're loopy!

18:26.872 --> 18:29.864
Hey, you know what's awesome, man?
Just... Hey!

18:30.509 --> 18:33.569
Yeah, there it is. All
right, do your thing.

18:33.712 --> 18:35.077
Do your thing.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.775
- What's up, bro?
- Hey, what's going on, dude- bro?

18:40.853 --> 18:43.253
Listen, I don't get this techno- trance,
glow stick shit, man.

18:43.322 --> 18:45.882
I don't like this music, man.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.823
I'm a techno DJ, bro, it's what I do.

18:47.893 --> 18:49.554
You got some old school hip hop?

18:49.628 --> 18:52.654
You know,
maybe play some De La Soul, Run DMC,

18:52.731 --> 18:54.722
maybe some Special Ed?
What do you think?

18:54.800 --> 18:55.789
Who?

18:56.401 --> 18:58.665
Hey, you should be ashamed of yourself,
you ain't no DJ, man!

18:58.737 --> 19:01.205
I used to DJ bar mitzvahs in Long Island.

19:01.273 --> 19:03.173
Old vinyl. Made a lot of money, man.

19:03.242 --> 19:04.766
Come on, play some hip hop.

19:04.843 --> 19:07.471
Bro, I've been doing this for 16 months!

19:07.546 --> 19:09.275
I take shits longer than that.

19:09.548 --> 19:12.745
Come on, this is... This
is shit music, man.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.548
You know what I'm saying?
Can I get some of this?

19:15.621 --> 19:17.714
That's my...

19:17.789 --> 19:20.053
Yeah! This music
makes me fucking nuts, man.

19:20.125 --> 19:21.820
It'll make you jump off a building

19:21.894 --> 19:23.623
and think you like it,
you know what I'm saying?

19:23.962 --> 19:26.192
Come on, man.
Play some better music, man!

19:26.265 --> 19:28.563
Everybody's freaking out here, man.

19:28.634 --> 19:31.865
- Listen, I'm gonna finish this
off, okay, bro? - That's mine.

19:31.937 --> 19:35.065
Nah, let me finish it, man.
It makes me feel good.

19:36.074 --> 19:39.066
I'll see you later, man.
High five! High five!

19:39.144 --> 19:40.270
Fist bump!

19:49.621 --> 19:52.613
Hey, listen, if they don't kill this noise,
I want to go home.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.352
You better be careful with that stuff, man.

19:54.426 --> 19:56.894
- You're gonna be fucked for ten hours.
- No, it says seven.

19:56.962 --> 19:59.021
I don't care if it says one.
You have a married system.

19:59.097 --> 20:00.496
You're weak and sensitive.

20:00.566 --> 20:01.931
Come on, man, let's go see some tits.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.991
You can't drop me in a club
and think I'm going to be okay.

20:04.069 --> 20:05.263
I don't think that's a good idea.

20:05.337 --> 20:08.238
I wanna go home.
I feel like I might catch Hep C in here.

20:08.307 --> 20:10.070
- Let's get out of here, all right?
- Let's go. Let's go.

20:10.142 --> 20:11.439
- Let's go.
- Go ahead. Go ahead.

20:11.510 --> 20:15.310
You know, something crazy happens
in a cab in New York late at night.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.314
I mean, your intentions are to go here,

20:17.382 --> 20:20.317
but sometimes
you always end up going there.

20:31.096 --> 20:32.961
- Look at this!
- Be cool, be cool.

20:33.031 --> 20:34.828
- This is awesome!
- This is what I need!

20:36.268 --> 20:37.929
How are you? How you doing?

20:38.003 --> 20:39.595
- Marty Martin.
- All right, easy.

20:39.671 --> 20:42.435
Wow, look at her... She's great.
Look at that.

20:42.507 --> 20:44.873
That's like... Is that bionic?

20:45.777 --> 20:47.267
That's like some Black Swan shit.

20:47.346 --> 20:48.870
- She must be classically trained!
- So beautiful.

20:48.947 --> 20:50.141
- Hi.
- Amber, hey.

20:50.215 --> 20:51.807
Who are these handsome men
you brought with you?

20:51.883 --> 20:53.350
- This is Marty and Paul.
- How you doing?

20:53.418 --> 20:56.410
Get a picture...
Give her your camera. Give her your phone.

20:56.488 --> 20:57.682
- Sure.
- Get a picture of us.

20:57.756 --> 20:59.223
Come on, guys,
I never get you out of the house.

20:59.291 --> 21:00.315
Let's get a nice picture.

21:00.392 --> 21:01.689
Is that the fucking Parchment guys?

21:01.760 --> 21:04.058
- Guys, smile for the camera.
- Yeah, it is the Parchment guys.

21:04.129 --> 21:06.097
- With the Australians?
- Guys, smile!

21:06.164 --> 21:08.359
No, those are the fucking guys
we just had the presentation with!

21:08.433 --> 21:09.695
Yeah, it is.

21:09.768 --> 21:12.066
- How you doing? Marty Martin.
- Did you get it?

21:12.137 --> 21:13.263
- Here you go.
- All right, good.

21:13.338 --> 21:15.169
I think I just put it
back to the main screen.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.208
- No problem.
- I'm Paul.

21:17.976 --> 21:20.843
No, I leave Marty to his online porn.

21:20.912 --> 21:23.073
If you want to watch two midgets
fuck an Asian clown,

21:23.148 --> 21:24.308
go ahead, be my guest.

21:24.383 --> 21:25.873
Is that a real fetish?

21:25.951 --> 21:28.181
- Honey, that's nothing.
- Oh, my God!

21:33.225 --> 21:36.319
I swear to God, I'm going to blow
my landscaper and record the whole thing.

21:36.395 --> 21:38.625
Look at this idiot,
he looks like a giant fish out of water.

21:38.697 --> 21:40.597
It looks like they don't even know
where the camera is.

21:40.666 --> 21:43.294
Some business meeting!
Okay, Marty, you know what?

21:43.368 --> 21:44.494
I'm gonna go down there,

21:44.569 --> 21:46.662
and I'm gonna let the crowd
bounce quarters off my ass!

21:46.738 --> 21:51.368
No shit! I can only
imagine the jumbled nonsensical bullshit

21:51.443 --> 21:53.240
that is coming out of that mouth right now.

21:53.745 --> 21:56.373
Branding basically
got its name from cattle branding,

21:56.448 --> 21:57.437
a lot of people don't know that.

21:57.516 --> 21:59.507
There's a misconception that
there's only one kind of branding,

21:59.584 --> 22:02.212
like name branding
or psychological branding...

22:02.287 --> 22:04.187
What's with all the talking?

22:04.756 --> 22:06.849
Do my boobs feel real?

22:07.592 --> 22:11.528
They... 100%.
I could brand the shit outta these.

22:11.596 --> 22:14.394
These things should have
their own TV show! That's...

22:19.504 --> 22:21.529
Order me a flank steak!

22:22.941 --> 22:25.466
All right, now, tell me again,
when does your ex get paroled?

22:28.013 --> 22:30.504
Yeah, make it rain! Look at that!

22:30.582 --> 22:32.914
You see that? Look at that.

22:32.984 --> 22:36.044
Was that $20? If that was $20
can I have that back, darling?

22:36.355 --> 22:39.324
Can you give me that back?
Please, can I have that... Fuck!

22:39.391 --> 22:42.827
Look at you guys. The boys from
Criminal Island are back again.

22:42.894 --> 22:44.088
You know, I don't like you guys.

22:44.162 --> 22:46.357
You guys come in here with
your tough- guy attitudes

22:46.431 --> 22:48.626
and your beer bellies. Fuck that shit!

22:48.700 --> 22:49.689
What is wrong with you?

22:49.901 --> 22:51.664
What are you talking about?
Calm down, mate.

22:51.737 --> 22:53.671
Fuck you, mate! Okay?

22:53.739 --> 22:58.176
This isn't some rugby field with kangaroos
and broad- shouldered women.

22:58.243 --> 22:59.870
This is the United States of America.

23:00.178 --> 23:03.511
And for the record, rugby is not
tougher than American football.

23:03.849 --> 23:06.181
Okay, you guys don't wear pads
because you don't need em!

23:06.251 --> 23:10.051
You ever heard of Lawrence Taylor?
Mark Gastineau? Dick Butkus?

23:10.122 --> 23:12.522
Mean Joe Greene will fuck you up!
I'll jump over you, okay?

23:12.591 --> 23:14.923
I don't play that shit,
I'll give you a forearm shiver!

23:15.394 --> 23:16.827
Is that coconut shrimp?

23:17.329 --> 23:19.456
- Yeah.
- Hey! Fuck ears!

23:19.531 --> 23:21.692
- Hey!
- What is your problem here?

23:21.967 --> 23:23.229
Fuck you, hooker lover!

23:23.668 --> 23:26.000
I'm trying to make...
Look at this beautiful lady,

23:26.071 --> 23:28.562
and you're fucking the whole shit up!
What is wrong with you?

23:28.874 --> 23:30.171
Kiss my ass, easy rider!

23:30.375 --> 23:32.900
And kiss my ass, too,
you fake Keanu Reeves!

23:32.978 --> 23:34.878
Take that howdy- doodie fucking hair

23:34.946 --> 23:37.005
and get back over there with
the two Stooges!

23:37.582 --> 23:40.312
- You fuck- ass! Beat it!
- Fuck you, mutton chops!

23:40.552 --> 23:42.383
Whispers in the marketing world are saying

23:42.454 --> 23:45.855
the sale of Goldbam to IgnitionOne
may be in jeopardy.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.653
Reports from the grapevine suggest

23:47.726 --> 23:50.889
Parchment Branding is now in talks
with IgnitionOne.

23:50.962 --> 23:52.589
This is getting very interesting.

23:52.664 --> 23:54.825
Who knows what could have provoked
the change of heart?

23:54.900 --> 23:57.425
- What are you doing over there?
- Revenge shopping.

23:57.502 --> 23:59.595
- What's your shoe size?
- Six and a half.

24:00.071 --> 24:01.868
I just added a pair for you.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.465
Lianne, meet six- inch,
burnt- persimmon pumps!

24:05.043 --> 24:06.943
Remind me to send this guy
a case of Brut for Christmas.

24:07.012 --> 24:09.207
Let me just adjust here, hold on.

24:12.050 --> 24:14.280
Oh, put my... There we go.

24:14.352 --> 24:15.751
I think you're being a
little hard on the guy.

24:15.821 --> 24:18.483
A biker gang really
is just another form of family,

24:18.557 --> 24:19.546
when you stop and think about it.

24:25.430 --> 24:28.024
Look, it's jackass number one.

24:28.366 --> 24:32.132
I cannot wait to hear this.
Please put him on speaker.

24:33.505 --> 24:35.803
I think theater classes are
an amazing idea for you.

24:35.874 --> 24:36.966
You see, you're so flexible,

24:37.175 --> 24:41.373
and you're so strong, you can play like
a Latin female superhero or something.

24:41.446 --> 24:44.540
And, you know, got a gravelly,
very unique quality to your voice,

24:44.616 --> 24:47.244
like a soda in your voice,
you could do voice- overs easily!

24:47.319 --> 24:48.479
That's so crazy you said that.

24:49.554 --> 24:54.321
Theater classes? I didn't realize
I was fucking Stanislavsky.

24:54.392 --> 24:57.190
I wish Stanislavsky were still alive
so I could fuck him.

24:57.262 --> 24:59.492
And Shakespeare. Tag- team them.

24:59.931 --> 25:02.024
I bet they were good listeners.

25:02.367 --> 25:05.029
To fuck, or not to fuck,
that's the real question.

25:05.904 --> 25:08.372
That was epic. I gotta thank you.

25:09.841 --> 25:12.241
- What's the damage?
- $1,500.

25:13.144 --> 25:14.771
$1,500.

25:15.380 --> 25:18.838
Every song I have to charge you.
Even if we're just talking.

25:18.917 --> 25:22.182
I didn't break all the windows.
What do you mean, $1,500?

25:23.054 --> 25:25.887
"$1,500"?

25:27.125 --> 25:29.252
Good for her.

25:29.327 --> 25:31.591
I am so in the wrong business.

25:31.663 --> 25:34.131
I need to put this body to some real use.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.360
Amen, forget curling up
on the couch reading,

25:36.434 --> 25:39.301
I should get these legs
in the streets, earning.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.340
You should.
You have some really good legs.

25:42.407 --> 25:44.739
- You have good legs!
- Thank you.

25:45.944 --> 25:48.310
Don't be so testy! I gave you my real name.

25:49.681 --> 25:51.171
Well, I need an ATM.

25:51.883 --> 25:53.612
You know, this one is on me tonight.

25:54.586 --> 25:56.747
Nobody's ever nailed my relationship
the way you just did.

25:56.821 --> 25:59.984
Well, girls love bad boys.
I mean, I went through my phase.

26:00.058 --> 26:02.390
- You did? When?
- Seventh grade.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.464
Send that picture back to them.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.900
I said some crazy shit to the Aussies.

26:11.970 --> 26:15.030
- Could this night get any worse!
- Shit!

26:15.106 --> 26:17.404
- I said some crazy shit!
- Let's go.

26:17.475 --> 26:19.204
What the fuck is this?

26:19.578 --> 26:22.604
What... What is this?
What the fuck is this?

26:22.681 --> 26:26.139
- How did they get that?
- This is gonna cost me a fortune.

26:26.217 --> 26:28.651
Lianne's gonna fuck the landscaper.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.051
You guys are gonna need my help.

26:30.255 --> 26:33.520
I let my boys take a
picture in a strip club.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.617
What the hell was I thinking?

26:35.994 --> 26:38.292
All right, the reentry.
The most important part, all right?

26:38.363 --> 26:40.627
And don't let her walk all over you.
Go in there and be a man.

26:40.699 --> 26:43.224
Take care of your business, okay?
Go get her.

26:46.204 --> 26:47.432
Balls!

26:54.746 --> 26:55.735
Hi, Liz.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.009
- Do you have something to say?
- I do.

26:58.083 --> 26:59.072
Then say it.

27:00.318 --> 27:03.549
Honey, I am way more popular
in the city than I am here.

27:03.622 --> 27:04.611
Excuse me?

27:04.689 --> 27:06.054
Honey, I love you very much,

27:06.124 --> 27:09.821
but having hot girls
come up to my table at Sapphire

27:09.894 --> 27:13.193
and telling me that
I'm the man is an amazing feeling.

27:13.264 --> 27:15.732
And it's something
I don't get here at the house

27:15.800 --> 27:18.667
but it is something I'd like more of.

27:18.737 --> 27:22.002
Maybe even as much as once a month,
if that's negotiable with you.

27:22.207 --> 27:24.141
Are you crazy?
You don't even know these people.

27:24.209 --> 27:27.269
That may be true, but I had one girl
tell me that she really likes me

27:27.345 --> 27:30.337
and then I had another girl tell me that
I have a dynamic personality.

27:30.415 --> 27:32.042
Those were her words, not mine.

27:33.284 --> 27:35.718
I had a really special night!

27:35.787 --> 27:37.311
You had a special night?

27:37.389 --> 27:38.617
Last night was a special night?

27:38.690 --> 27:40.851
Paul, our wedding night
was a special night!

27:40.992 --> 27:43.085
This blew it away, believe it or not.

27:43.728 --> 27:44.820
Wow!

27:46.498 --> 27:48.557
Wow! Paul, what is going on with you?

27:48.633 --> 27:51.033
I don't know, but check it out,
do you know that I can dance?

27:51.636 --> 27:53.467
- No.
- Neither did I.

27:53.705 --> 27:56.299
I was like John Travolta in his heyday,
you should have seen it.

27:56.374 --> 27:58.205
I'm doing that... I'm doing high kicks!

27:58.276 --> 28:00.210
I didn't know
my hamstrings were that flexible.

28:00.278 --> 28:02.007
Oh, my God, I completely forgot.

28:02.080 --> 28:05.277
So, looking for a nanny, are you?
Guess what, found one!

28:05.350 --> 28:06.977
- Paul...
- I know.

28:07.052 --> 28:10.783
I met this fantastic cocktail waitress
at Sapphire,

28:10.855 --> 28:13.551
her name is CCadillac with two "C's",
which I think is awesome.

28:13.625 --> 28:15.650
- I will never forgive you.
- You should.

28:15.727 --> 28:19.891
And I'll tell you why. Because I love you,
and I was just having good, clean fun.

28:20.365 --> 28:21.832
- You love me?
- Yes.

28:21.900 --> 28:23.060
You love me?

28:23.134 --> 28:25.932
- Well love this!
- Okay...

28:27.272 --> 28:29.103
Yeah, well, of course that didn't happen,

28:29.174 --> 28:32.405
but 38% of the time
a wife will go easy on the husband

28:32.477 --> 28:33.944
if his friend is there upon reentry.

28:34.813 --> 28:37.475
The reentry, very important. Okay?

28:37.549 --> 28:41.110
So just go in, be humble,
be loving, listen.

28:41.186 --> 28:42.847
Technically I did nothing wrong...

28:42.921 --> 28:44.980
You fucked up a little bit, all right?
So be apologetic.

28:45.056 --> 28:46.216
And you know what, I won't say a word.

28:46.357 --> 28:47.824
Hey, Liz?

28:48.927 --> 28:50.121
Liz?

28:50.195 --> 28:52.663
I know there is be a really good reason
I had to look at that photo shoot

28:52.731 --> 28:55.029
and the fact that you are coming home
when the sun is coming up.

28:55.100 --> 28:59.036
And that conversation that I had to
listen to between you and the stripper?

28:59.104 --> 29:00.628
Oh. my God!

29:00.705 --> 29:03.196
Well, let me start by saying
the whole thing was my fault, sis.

29:03.308 --> 29:05.401
This has nothing to do with you, Mike.
Please go.

29:05.477 --> 29:07.001
But before I leave, may I just say this.

29:07.078 --> 29:10.912
I have noticed a vast improvement in Paul
as a human being,

29:10.982 --> 29:12.973
and the dancer, by the way,
she was a friend of my...

29:13.051 --> 29:14.075
I will kill you.

29:14.486 --> 29:16.818
Okay, I'll go. I love you. Goodbye.

29:16.888 --> 29:19.482
- And on a closing note...
- Mike! Out!

29:19.657 --> 29:21.386
- You're on your own.
- Okay. She was a friend.

29:21.459 --> 29:22.448
You!

29:22.527 --> 29:25.223
I can't believe that
I didn't fuck the concierge in Cabo.

29:25.296 --> 29:28.094
We were on the trip together.
Why is that something you can't believe?

29:28.166 --> 29:29.997
I could be four pool boys deep by now.

29:30.068 --> 29:32.400
Is that a goal?
Is that something you really wanna do?

29:32.470 --> 29:34.529
Because that kind of behavior
can work against you.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.767
I can't get you to take
a picture with friends,

29:36.841 --> 29:38.900
and then these hookers say "Cheese!"
and you jump.

29:38.977 --> 29:40.410
I don't think they're actually hookers.

29:40.478 --> 29:43.504
I think they're professional dancers
who are struggling for work.

29:43.581 --> 29:45.242
You know,
there's a financial crisis going on.

29:45.316 --> 29:47.216
People will do whatever they can
to get work these days.

29:47.285 --> 29:50.254
Fine, Marty. Maybe I'll
give dancing a shot.

29:50.321 --> 29:52.915
Wake up. Join the party.
It is not that difficult.

29:52.991 --> 29:54.652
Hey, great face, by the way.

29:54.726 --> 29:56.921
Were you having a heart attack
or an orgasm? I couldn't tell.

29:57.328 --> 30:00.525
Can I at least have my jersey back?
You have three of my shirts!

30:00.598 --> 30:02.862
You have my button- down,
you have my Henley...

30:02.934 --> 30:05.300
No. You're not returning,
that's called stealing.

30:05.370 --> 30:07.270
If you don't return... Hello?

30:07.605 --> 30:08.833
Damn it!

30:09.574 --> 30:11.007
All right, guys, let's get to this!

30:11.075 --> 30:13.805
I feel responsible.
I got my sister breathing down my neck,

30:13.878 --> 30:15.368
I got a bar to run, what have we got?

30:15.446 --> 30:17.812
Guys, I heard all about what's going on.

30:17.882 --> 30:19.611
We are gonna work this out.

30:19.684 --> 30:22.881
You know, I have yet to meet anyone
who ignores customers more than this one.

30:22.954 --> 30:25.354
We are all on the same team here.

30:25.423 --> 30:27.721
If you need me, I'll be three feet away.

30:27.792 --> 30:28.850
- Thank you.
- All right, give it to me.

30:28.927 --> 30:31.521
- Give it to me. What have you got?
- It's not good. I don't feel good.

30:31.596 --> 30:32.961
My panic attacks are coming back.

30:33.031 --> 30:35.625
I'm starting to taste metal,
and I have a sebaceous cyst

30:35.700 --> 30:36.689
growing in the back of my head.

30:36.768 --> 30:39.931
And my wife is threatening
to fuck every pool boy we ever hired.

30:40.004 --> 30:41.198
Lianne is not going to fuck the pool boy.

30:41.272 --> 30:43.740
Have you seen my guy?
He basically said "Fuck shirts."

30:46.244 --> 30:47.734
He is a good- looking, muscular guy.

30:47.812 --> 30:50.212
He looks like
one of those Telemundo soap stars.

30:50.281 --> 30:51.908
I don't know why you hire guys like that.

30:51.983 --> 30:53.575
- I'm not saying that...
- Guys, stop.

30:54.118 --> 30:55.745
What are the top complaints
from your wives?

30:56.921 --> 30:58.616
- You know...
- Top five or top 10?

30:58.690 --> 31:00.487
- I don't even know where to start.
- Start with one.

31:00.558 --> 31:02.025
What does she not like? What does she say?

31:02.093 --> 31:03.754
- She says I smell like...
- Like me. She doesn't like me.

31:03.828 --> 31:05.693
She says I smell like mushrooms sometimes.

31:10.735 --> 31:13.465
All right, guys, I know I fucked up,
but I'm gonna make this right. Okay?

31:13.538 --> 31:15.267
I got the fix. You listening?

31:15.340 --> 31:16.329
- Yeah.
- Here's what I'm gonna do.

31:16.507 --> 31:19.032
I'm gonna take things
I've learned in my single life

31:19.110 --> 31:21.010
and help you apply them
to your married life.

31:21.079 --> 31:22.944
Yeah, but how long is something like this
gonna take?

31:23.381 --> 31:24.405
I don't know, a week?

31:24.816 --> 31:27.114
No, no, Lianne's gonna be married to
Jose Jr. by then.

31:27.185 --> 31:30.177
She's gonna have a whole Mexican family
with little kids wearing sombreros,

31:30.255 --> 31:32.189
doing the cha- cha- cha,
eating guacamole dip.

31:32.257 --> 31:33.451
- Marty!
- What?

31:33.524 --> 31:36.516
How are you going to take
what you learned in your single life

31:36.594 --> 31:39.654
and have us apply it to our married life?

31:39.731 --> 31:41.790
You have sex with beautiful strangers,

31:41.866 --> 31:44.562
and we make waffles at 7:00 a.m.

31:44.636 --> 31:48.072
Because everything I say,
everything I do when it comes to women

31:48.139 --> 31:50.835
is about connection. You understand?

31:50.909 --> 31:54.401
You, my boys, have lost your ability
to connect with your wives.

31:54.479 --> 31:56.071
You're right, you know,
I can't even connect the cable!

31:56.147 --> 31:57.136
I hate my life.

31:57.215 --> 31:58.910
Well, you won't hate yourself
after I'm done with you

31:58.983 --> 32:00.678
because I'm gonna bring back
everything you lost.

32:00.752 --> 32:01.776
- What, like my manhood?
- No!

32:01.853 --> 32:03.844
Like, like being spontaneous.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.856
Remember how spontaneous
you guys used to be?

32:05.924 --> 32:07.892
You'd do special things for your wife,

32:07.959 --> 32:10.120
you'd show up at her work,
you'd give her little special calls,

32:10.194 --> 32:11.320
you'd leave little notes.

32:11.396 --> 32:13.125
- Shock and awe?
- Shock and awe!

32:13.197 --> 32:14.459
- Surprise them?
- Exactly.

32:14.532 --> 32:15.863
Surprise them with something.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.801
- Caress your woman, caress your woman!
- Yeah.

32:19.203 --> 32:20.363
What are you doing?

32:20.605 --> 32:22.766
I'm practicing my caress.
Don't be a baby about it.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.831
Admire your wives. All right?

32:24.909 --> 32:26.900
And I don't just mean
admire them with your eyes,

32:26.978 --> 32:29.947
admire them with, with everything,
with your energy,

32:30.248 --> 32:32.011
your ability to listen to them.

32:32.083 --> 32:35.484
You know how much a girl gets turned on
if you're really listening to her?

32:35.553 --> 32:38.044
You gotta be part of your wife's life,
you know?

32:38.122 --> 32:41.023
You gotta be there. You have to...
You know, to put it very simply,

32:41.092 --> 32:42.184
you have to just show up.

32:42.660 --> 32:45.390
Show up? Show up where? Where we going,
the Copacabana? Where are we going?

32:45.663 --> 32:47.255
- Wherever she is.
- No.

32:47.332 --> 32:49.232
No, Lianne is like
a cracked- out humming bird.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.927
It's exhausting just thinking about this.

32:51.002 --> 32:53.664
Now see, that's...
Remember how funny you used to be?

32:53.738 --> 32:56.229
Like that. That sense of humor?
Bring that into your relationship, man.

32:56.307 --> 32:58.775
Women love a guy with a sense of humor.

32:59.310 --> 33:00.334
Funny gets you laid.

33:03.848 --> 33:06.180
Personality's coming back, guys.
It's coming back.

33:07.552 --> 33:11.010
Trust me, fellas, I got eight jokes
and a Honda Accord, I'm fucking everybody.

33:13.558 --> 33:15.492
That's right, fun is the new money.

33:15.693 --> 33:17.820
Right? We had so much fun
she forgot we didn't eat.

33:20.198 --> 33:22.462
She's just home, hungry and happy.

33:23.101 --> 33:25.092
I wish that was the case.

33:25.169 --> 33:27.034
But how do you make a relationship work?
Here's what I say.

33:27.105 --> 33:29.903
I say embrace the flaws, love the flaws.

33:30.742 --> 33:32.039
Right, just do it. You gotta be like,

33:32.110 --> 33:33.975
"Oh, babe, that's so cute
how you yelled at me

33:34.045 --> 33:35.273
"about shit that didn't happen. "

33:37.281 --> 33:39.841
That is so adorable
how you left the lights on eight times,

33:39.917 --> 33:41.009
and we haven't even left yet.

33:41.085 --> 33:42.677
Come here, I wanna hold you.

33:44.489 --> 33:45.513
Hey, hey- 

33:45.590 --> 33:46.887
- Good show tonight.
- Thanks for coming.

33:47.158 --> 33:48.750
- That was good.
- Thank you.

33:48.826 --> 33:50.726
What, do you just
make this stuff up from real life?

33:50.962 --> 33:53.522
Yeah. I wish it wasn't real life.
That's all based on my ex.

33:53.731 --> 33:55.084
Bad in life, great in bed.
You know the type.

33:55.097 --> 33:56.461
Same with him.

33:56.734 --> 33:59.066
- Hey!
- Hey, Clarissa.

33:59.570 --> 34:00.901
- How are you?
- Good.

34:00.972 --> 34:02.132
I didn't know you were coming here tonight.

34:02.206 --> 34:04.766
You don't know my schedule.
You were hilarious tonight.

34:04.976 --> 34:06.375
What, you didn't think I was funny before?

34:06.544 --> 34:08.637
No. It's just that it's really good now.

34:09.047 --> 34:12.380
Timing, the material, the whole thing.
It's just tight.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.208
It's tight. Things are getting tighter.

34:14.351 --> 34:16.616
- Very, very tight.
- It's getting tight.

34:16.920 --> 34:20.049
Tight acts. Things are tightening up.
It's getting tighter.

34:20.123 --> 34:21.351
Very, very, very tight.

34:21.426 --> 34:23.553
Look at this witty banter off stage.

34:23.628 --> 34:24.754
That's... He's funny.

34:24.829 --> 34:27.161
Fellas, I want to thank you,
I gotta get back to my wife.

34:27.498 --> 34:28.658
You are married now?

34:28.900 --> 34:30.492
- Yeah. Five years.
- A long time.

34:30.568 --> 34:32.661
Five? Okay.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.466
Because I slept with you three years ago.

34:35.840 --> 34:38.866
So did half the Giggle Hut in Santa Monica,
I'm sorry.

34:38.943 --> 34:41.571
It's what comedians do.
We travel, we try to get laid.

34:41.646 --> 34:43.170
We tell jokes, but at the end of the day

34:43.246 --> 34:46.478
we're just sad, alone
crying in a hotel, randomly.

34:47.185 --> 34:51.087
It's not pretty. You look amazing.
I got a gig. Later, fellas.

34:51.155 --> 34:52.417
- Good to see you, man.
- Good luck.

34:52.489 --> 34:53.717
Go with God.

34:53.791 --> 34:56.487
God, I knew I should have slept
with Chappelle that night.

34:56.561 --> 34:58.392
They were on the same bill.

34:58.463 --> 35:01.830
- Funny gets you laid.
- Yeah. Funny gets you laid.

35:05.136 --> 35:07.730
- Two Jews walk into a bar...
- Go fuck yourself.

35:07.805 --> 35:09.170
Love you.

35:09.774 --> 35:11.765
- Knock- knock.
- Fuck you.

35:12.977 --> 35:14.137
A midget and a black guy...

35:14.212 --> 35:17.272
Marty, really? Take the couch.
I'm serious. Take the couch.

35:22.320 --> 35:25.414
Well hello, my little Albert Vagine- Stein.

35:25.490 --> 35:26.718
Oh, my God.

35:26.791 --> 35:28.418
There she is, naughty librarian.

35:28.493 --> 35:31.326
My little Liz Scott Fitzgerald.

35:31.395 --> 35:34.558
- Wow, have you been drinking?
- All studious and whatnot.

35:34.632 --> 35:36.327
Whatcha reading? Not that it matters.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.992
Let's say we take a little reading break.

35:38.069 --> 35:40.867
Paul, really, no. I worked out
and it's that time of the month.

35:40.938 --> 35:43.133
Really? Like that stops me.

35:43.207 --> 35:44.697
- Honey, please.
- I'm an animal.

35:46.544 --> 35:48.273
- Wanna see how a bear reads?
- No.

35:48.346 --> 35:49.506
No? You sure?

35:50.648 --> 35:53.583
- Paul, come on!
- Paw swatted... Sorry.

35:53.651 --> 35:55.983
- That's my bear strength.
- Paul, please.

35:56.053 --> 35:59.386
Okay, then I'm gonna walk out of here
real slow like this never happened.

35:59.457 --> 36:02.483
Maybe take a shower
and try again in about 10 minutes.

36:02.560 --> 36:05.085
Good luck. Good luck.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.791
My little Liz- bian. Liz- bian.

36:07.865 --> 36:08.854
Paul.

36:13.337 --> 36:16.170
I mean, you know,
the guy ran four miles a day,

36:16.240 --> 36:18.504
ate healthy, barely ever drank...

36:19.544 --> 36:21.876
And he dies on the golf course,
at the seventh hole.

36:21.946 --> 36:24.881
Midday. Right in front of us. Dead.

36:24.949 --> 36:26.280
You know, the doctors say he threw a clot.

36:26.350 --> 36:28.716
- Oh, that is so horrible.
- You know, his son's with me...

36:28.786 --> 36:31.653
I don't know what to tell him. I just
keep saying "Your father's sleeping."

36:31.722 --> 36:33.383
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, honey.

36:33.457 --> 36:35.152
I suck at golf!

36:35.226 --> 36:36.215
Who cares about golf?

36:36.861 --> 36:38.920
- Who has time to be good at golf?
- Excuse me?

36:40.498 --> 36:41.487
What?

36:41.566 --> 36:45.662
You just laughed while he was telling you
about his friend dying during golf.

36:47.238 --> 36:48.830
- Yeah, no. It's funny.
- Funny?

36:48.906 --> 36:51.204
- It's... You're such a fucking asshole!
- No, no... No.

36:51.275 --> 36:53.402
- Paul, do you want to apologize?
- Yeah, yeah.

36:54.579 --> 36:56.171
- Do you?
- Do I what?

36:56.247 --> 36:58.408
Want to apologize for laughing at
the death of his friend.

36:58.482 --> 37:01.280
No, I'm not laughing.
I wasn't laughing at the death...

37:01.352 --> 37:03.513
I'm laughing at the fragility of life

37:04.255 --> 37:05.620
on this planet.

37:07.692 --> 37:09.853
Shares of Paul are said to
be plummeting right now

37:09.927 --> 37:12.452
as his behavior is borderline unacceptable.

37:12.530 --> 37:14.191
Now they say that men love with their eyes,

37:14.265 --> 37:15.755
and women love with their ears.

37:15.833 --> 37:17.027
Well, it's time to change that up.

37:17.101 --> 37:18.591
I had to teach my boys how to listen.

37:18.669 --> 37:20.967
Look at this shit, I like this place.
This is cool.

37:21.038 --> 37:23.632
I feel like Katy Perry
is going to jump on the bar

37:23.708 --> 37:26.609
and start a concert
with lightning shooting out of her boobies.

37:26.677 --> 37:30.443
I feel like Justin Bieber is
going to jump out of a keg and jerk me off.

37:30.514 --> 37:31.879
I wish.

37:33.017 --> 37:34.006
What are we doing here?

37:34.085 --> 37:36.212
All right,
your wives say you don't listen, right?

37:36.287 --> 37:37.982
That you don't engage in conversation.

37:38.055 --> 37:41.491
You're about to engage in a conversation
you know or care nothing about.

37:41.559 --> 37:43.959
Three "L's". Look, listen, and learn.

37:44.028 --> 37:45.859
If you can listen to these girls ramble on,

37:45.930 --> 37:48.091
listening to your wife
will be a cakewalk. Come on.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.496
All right,
boys, this is Jen, Jordan and Malea.

37:50.601 --> 37:51.625
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:51.702 --> 37:53.602
- How are you doing?
- How are you? I'm married with kids.

37:53.671 --> 37:55.332
- Wow...
- Nice.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.301
Welcome to the promised land of listening.

37:57.375 --> 37:59.400
- All right.
- Malea, tell your story.

37:59.477 --> 38:02.844
Okay, so I grew up in foster homes
for the first seven years of my life,

38:02.913 --> 38:04.232
till I found a family that
I really, really love.

38:04.245 --> 38:05.575
I love them
so much.

38:05.650 --> 38:07.174
I have always dreamt about being a dancer,

38:07.251 --> 38:10.277
so what do you know,
I got onto the Michael Buble tour,

38:10.488 --> 38:12.080
where I actually lost my virginity.

38:12.523 --> 38:13.854
I'm not proud of it...

38:14.191 --> 38:17.388
But that actually got me into
the Backstreet Boys reunion tour,

38:17.461 --> 38:19.190
and I think I found my calling.

38:19.764 --> 38:21.891
All right, good.
Now Marty, if you were really listening,

38:21.966 --> 38:23.297
you'll be able to repeat what she said.

38:23.367 --> 38:24.766
- Give us some details.
- Nothing.

38:24.835 --> 38:26.735
Your dad worked at Foster Grant,

38:26.804 --> 38:30.035
and you blew Michael Buble...

38:30.107 --> 38:31.438
- Marty!
- When you were on a boat.

38:31.509 --> 38:33.136
- She slept with Michael Bublé.
- No!

38:33.210 --> 38:36.577
And then
you started dancing for Marky Mark

38:36.647 --> 38:38.308
and then had sex with the Funky Bunch?

38:38.683 --> 38:40.981
- Right? And you grew up in Baltimore.
- Marty!

38:41.052 --> 38:42.883
And you sing opera, right?

38:43.354 --> 38:44.651
- Fail!
- Fail what?

38:44.722 --> 38:45.848
You're not listening, Marty.

38:45.923 --> 38:48.016
She slept with the Backstreet Boys,
not with Marky Mark.

38:48.092 --> 38:49.889
- Excuse me, you don't sing opera?
- No, I do not.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.086
- Country?
- No.

38:51.162 --> 38:52.652
- You figure skate?
- No!

38:52.730 --> 38:54.891
- No.
- That's the point of this exercise.

38:54.965 --> 38:56.728
You gotta listen. You gotta listen!

38:56.801 --> 38:58.393
Darling, did you not just say
you sing opera?

38:58.469 --> 39:00.300
- No, I did not just say that.
- Let me show you how it's done.

39:00.371 --> 39:01.702
- Stop, stop, stop!
- What is going on here?

39:01.772 --> 39:03.831
- Stop!
- You don't listen.

39:03.908 --> 39:05.466
- Exactly. I listen.
- Stop.

39:05.543 --> 39:07.010
- Let's try this again.
- Okay.

39:07.078 --> 39:08.875
- Jen, tell your story.
- Go ahead.

39:08.946 --> 39:10.811
This is my story on how
I lost my virginity.

39:10.881 --> 39:12.906
- Virginity, I like that.
- All right.

39:12.983 --> 39:16.544
Okay. So I was in the backseat of an SUV
at a rock show in Atlanta.

39:17.154 --> 39:19.520
The windows were all fogged up
so I assumed that nobody could see in,

39:19.590 --> 39:21.785
but then I looked up and...

39:33.070 --> 39:34.833
Needless to say, I have a reputation.

39:34.905 --> 39:36.497
- Yeah.
- All right, Paul.

39:36.907 --> 39:38.272
- Were you listening?
- Yes.

39:38.342 --> 39:40.310
- So. Okay.
- Go.

39:42.146 --> 39:45.638
You're in Atlanta,
you lost your virginity in a car wash.

39:45.716 --> 39:48.776
There were six people in the car.
And it's in the air.

39:48.853 --> 39:51.117
No, no, no, Paul. A, you're getting creepy.

39:51.455 --> 39:53.446
Guys, guys. Listen, listen.

39:53.524 --> 39:55.185
I used to babysit for my next door neighbor

39:55.259 --> 39:56.817
and he took me to a Knicks game,

39:56.894 --> 39:59.021
we sat front row, on the floor.

39:59.430 --> 40:01.489
I had to move away, change my identity.

40:02.266 --> 40:03.858
My name's not really Jordan.

40:04.802 --> 40:05.996
And go.

40:07.338 --> 40:10.239
Your father founded the Black Panthers.

40:10.374 --> 40:13.366
Your mom's a Puerto Rican Jew, and...

40:13.811 --> 40:15.438
Excuse me!

40:31.061 --> 40:34.792
I think it's really cool
how you hang out with older guys.

40:34.865 --> 40:35.923
They're not that much older.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.228
- They're a little older than me.
- Really?

40:37.301 --> 40:39.098
Yeah. Okay, bye. gulls- 

40:39.170 --> 40:40.967
My wife is gonna call you
about the babysitting.

40:41.038 --> 40:42.665
Older? What do you mean, older?

40:42.740 --> 40:44.332
Yeah, what are you talking about?
We're the same age.

40:44.408 --> 40:45.875
They don't know that. Sometimes I lie.

40:45.943 --> 40:48.138
If they say early 20s, I say early 30s.

40:48.212 --> 40:50.203
They say mid- 20s, I say mid- 30s.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.146
The rest is sort of on a sliding scale.

40:52.216 --> 40:54.810
Yeah. Well, again, fuck you, man.

40:57.721 --> 41:01.748
Paul. Emily's piano recital
is in a couple of days.

41:01.826 --> 41:04.761
Emily's piano recital
is in a couple of days.

41:05.629 --> 41:06.721
I'm trying to be serious here.

41:06.797 --> 41:09.265
She's playing for my dad's friends
at the nursing home.

41:09.333 --> 41:10.459
You are being serious.

41:10.534 --> 41:14.265
She is playing for your dad's friends
at the nursing home.

41:14.638 --> 41:15.696
What are you doing?

41:16.407 --> 41:17.396
Everything.

41:18.142 --> 41:19.439
Is this your idea of turning me on?

41:20.010 --> 41:22.706
Is this your idea of pretending
I'm not turning you on?

41:23.280 --> 41:26.147
Wow, I can barely contain myself.
I just came twice.

41:26.550 --> 41:27.881
Where has my husband gone?

41:28.719 --> 41:31.449
I don't know where he's gone.
I do know where he's going.

41:31.522 --> 41:32.546
I just spoke to our lawyers,

41:32.623 --> 41:35.057
and apparently
the Australians are reconsidering.

41:37.228 --> 41:39.093
Mommy!

41:39.830 --> 41:41.457
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

41:41.532 --> 41:44.695
Okay. I'll go make some money!

41:45.669 --> 41:47.466
Oh, Paul.

41:54.845 --> 41:57.109
- Hey, Maur, sorry.
- Hey, Paul.

41:57.181 --> 41:58.307
- Good news.
- Yeah?

41:58.382 --> 42:01.408
And I don't know how I did it,

42:01.952 --> 42:05.718
but I managed to get the Australians
back into your good graces.

42:05.789 --> 42:08.257
They're going to take another look
at your company.

42:09.593 --> 42:12.061
- Okay. Do you want to use the bathroom?
- Damn this cold.

42:12.129 --> 42:13.562
What? What for?

42:14.899 --> 42:17.265
Shit! Okay. All right, thanks, Maur.

42:17.334 --> 42:19.097
That's great news.
You're the best lawyer ever.

42:19.169 --> 42:20.158
- Okay.
- No problem.

42:20.504 --> 42:22.699
- That's what you pay me for.
- Yep.

42:22.773 --> 42:24.331
Don't screw it up, that's my advice.

42:24.408 --> 42:25.875
Okay, thanks, I won't.

42:25.943 --> 42:27.604
Hey, Maury.

42:29.346 --> 42:30.677
He just...

42:31.048 --> 42:32.242
See ya.

42:32.316 --> 42:33.578
Fuck, did you just blow Maury?

42:33.651 --> 42:34.879
- Come on.
- What was that?

42:34.952 --> 42:36.476
That thing looks like a dead baby bird!

42:36.554 --> 42:37.782
No idea. It was just sitting out like that.

42:37.855 --> 42:39.049
He doesn't feel the air on it?

42:39.123 --> 42:40.181
He's g0in9- 

42:40.257 --> 42:43.055
Great news, listen to me. Australians,
they're giving us a second chance.

42:43.127 --> 42:44.594
- Oh, good!
- They're coming back in six days.

42:44.662 --> 42:46.527
All right, good. We need that. That's huge.

42:46.597 --> 42:47.689
- I know, I know.
- Okay, good.

42:47.765 --> 42:49.733
That's going to fuck me up
for a long time, man.

42:49.800 --> 42:52.268
How long did it stay... What was that?
He didn't feel the air on it?

42:52.336 --> 42:54.668
He was sitting on that chair.
What am I going to do with the chair?

42:54.738 --> 42:55.796
- I gotta throw it away.
- Get rid of it.

42:55.873 --> 42:57.033
Can somebody help me
get this chair out of here?

42:57.107 --> 42:58.165
Get some bleach. Bleach it.

42:58.242 --> 42:59.402
I'm not touching it.

42:59.777 --> 43:01.540
The boys must have done something right.

43:01.612 --> 43:04.342
First came Martin and Lewis,
now comes Martin and Gold.

43:04.415 --> 43:06.110
The boys are back in the game.

43:08.018 --> 43:11.545
Paul's idea of spontaneity is to put
a hand on my breast, mid- sentence.

43:12.189 --> 43:13.554
It's cute.

43:13.624 --> 43:16.252
Marty's idea of spontaneity
is getting something

43:16.327 --> 43:18.227
other than Chinese food on Sunday nights.

43:18.295 --> 43:20.593
Well, way to shake up the norm, babe.
Thanks so much.

43:20.664 --> 43:24.293
And the listening!
The listening has reached an all- time low.

43:24.368 --> 43:27.462
Listening? I sent Marty to the
store to get orange juice,

43:27.538 --> 43:29.699
he came back with milk and M&Ms.

43:29.773 --> 43:30.762
Really?

43:30.841 --> 43:33.901
Paul thinks I don't notice with
the fake- listen head- nod move.

43:33.978 --> 43:35.206
Fake- listen head- nod.

43:35.279 --> 43:38.373
Yeah, Marty perfected
that move years ago, so...

43:39.516 --> 43:41.711
It is amazing to me, amazing to me,

43:41.785 --> 43:45.983
that they can be so smart in business
and so stupid at home!

43:46.056 --> 43:47.523
- I know.
- Maybe it's, like, a thing.

43:47.591 --> 43:50.082
Do you think Bill Gates forgets
what grade his daughter is in?

43:50.160 --> 43:52.628
No, I doubt it. He owns the school.

43:52.696 --> 43:53.720
That would help.

43:53.797 --> 43:56.027
- This is, like, soaked in booze.
- Is it really?

43:56.100 --> 43:57.089
It's so good.

43:57.167 --> 43:58.691
They say that about the pineappley parts.

43:58.769 --> 44:00.236
Where did my pineappley part go?

44:00.704 --> 44:01.693
Hey!

44:01.772 --> 44:03.706
- What's up?
- Sit down.

44:03.774 --> 44:05.036
Hey, where's the fire? What is this?

44:05.109 --> 44:06.406
I can believe this. I can't take it.

44:06.477 --> 44:08.468
Don't ask, just watch.
And watch with your wives.

44:08.545 --> 44:11.241
Oh, no, I stopped doing porn.
It's too intimidating.

44:11.315 --> 44:12.475
It doesn't intimidate me.

44:12.549 --> 44:14.039
It's not porn.

44:14.118 --> 44:16.609
We got Beaches, Steel Magnolias
and The Champ.

44:16.687 --> 44:18.985
Oh, hell, no!
I'm not watching The Champ, man.

44:19.056 --> 44:20.045
That's too much, man.

44:20.124 --> 44:22.319
If I saw Ricky Schroder right now,
I'd start crying.

44:22.559 --> 44:25.153
Fucking kid's crying in the ring,
"Champ, wake up, Champ!"

44:25.229 --> 44:26.696
And he had the blue eyes and the freckles.

44:26.764 --> 44:28.163
- No, Marty, Marty...
- No, I can't watch that shit.

44:28.232 --> 44:29.426
Marty, Marty, that's the point.

44:29.500 --> 44:31.024
Women love that shit, okay?

44:31.101 --> 44:32.090
Next to Brian's Song,

44:32.169 --> 44:34.137
The Champ is one of the greatest man cries
of all time.

44:34.204 --> 44:37.367
Society tries to tell us that
women don't want sensitive men, right?

44:37.441 --> 44:40.808
I say fuck society. Cry your way back in.
Make it a couple's cry.

44:40.878 --> 44:42.106
What about Rocky?

44:42.179 --> 44:45.148
Classic underdog tale, but doesn't get
sensitive until Mickey dies in III.

44:45.215 --> 44:47.445
- That's true.
- It's messed up when Apollo dies, too.

44:47.518 --> 44:49.748
That really killed me. And you know
what else is a good one? Lassie.

44:50.020 --> 44:52.648
I can't even keep that film in the house.
It's too overwhelming emotionally.

44:52.723 --> 44:54.020
Nothing sexy about a dead dog.

44:54.191 --> 44:56.352
- Lassie didn't die.
- In real life, she did.

44:56.527 --> 44:57.824
- Like in real life?
- Guys...

44:57.895 --> 44:58.884
Real Lassie died?

44:58.962 --> 45:01.556
Listen to me, a couple that
cries together, stays together.

45:01.632 --> 45:02.621
Go do your work.

45:06.370 --> 45:08.463
I never thought it would end this way.

45:08.539 --> 45:10.063
Look at that hair.

45:10.507 --> 45:12.168
It's awful.

45:12.676 --> 45:14.109
If it's my last week on Earth,

45:14.178 --> 45:17.113
do not let me leave the house
looking like that.

45:17.181 --> 45:19.308
I'll be dead in a week!

45:19.783 --> 45:21.614
Oh, God, I need sun.

45:21.685 --> 45:23.346
I'm like an albino, I'm so pale.

45:27.191 --> 45:29.989
Hey, babe, you know
that bully parent, Calvin?

45:30.094 --> 45:34.155
Little guy? Napoleon complex?
At Alex's practice?

45:34.231 --> 45:35.220
Yeah.

45:35.299 --> 45:38.393
The one that's always
screaming and yelling.

45:38.469 --> 45:40.664
- He's scaring the kids.
- Okay.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.763
Someone needs to say
something to him, okay?

45:42.840 --> 45:45.570
Yeah, I'm sure somebody will talk to him.

45:46.710 --> 45:48.678
Someone like you, Marty.

45:51.415 --> 45:52.541
ok3Y- 

45:53.917 --> 45:55.384
ok3Y- 

45:56.286 --> 45:58.811
I know, but look at me.

45:59.389 --> 46:01.289
I can't stop looking at you.

46:01.358 --> 46:03.292
Stop looking at me like that.

46:03.360 --> 46:05.055
My hair's gone.

46:05.796 --> 46:08.856
The Little League loudmouth parent.
It's an epidemic.

46:09.199 --> 46:10.996
It'll be my pleasure
to show Marty a few things.

46:13.137 --> 46:16.231
Now, I don't condone violence,
but my boy here, he loves it.

46:17.674 --> 46:21.770
So obviously your first choice in any
confrontation is to defuse the situation,

46:21.845 --> 46:24.040
but we all know that
sometimes that doesn't work.

46:24.114 --> 46:25.206
- Right?
- Right.

46:25.282 --> 46:26.613
Okay. So, sometimes
you got to throw a beating.

46:26.784 --> 46:28.843
Look, I'm just putting this out there.

46:28.919 --> 46:32.116
I had Osgood- Schlatters
and my doctor said it came back.

46:32.189 --> 46:33.486
Marty, that's a children's ailment.

46:33.557 --> 46:35.787
I don't make this shit up.
That's what the doctor said.

46:35.859 --> 46:37.486
Marty, working out is sexy.

46:37.561 --> 46:39.153
Women outlive men, but we don't want that.

46:39.229 --> 46:42.858
We want you to be alive and strong
and on our side for the long haul.

46:42.933 --> 46:45.265
This is all very touching,
but can we do some work here?

46:45.335 --> 46:46.666
- Want to do some work?
- Yeah.

46:46.737 --> 46:48.034
- You wanna show me your jab?
- Yeah.

46:48.105 --> 46:49.094
- You wanna punch?
- Yeah.

46:49.173 --> 46:50.640
Okay, now digs, let's see some work.

46:50.707 --> 46:51.696
Let's go, Marty.

46:54.378 --> 46:56.073
Be the man we know you are, Marty.

46:56.146 --> 46:57.545
Jab it, yeah!

47:02.252 --> 47:04.516
Keep your balance! Jab, right, jab!

47:06.223 --> 47:08.384
- Get him, Marty!
- Again.

47:21.939 --> 47:23.668
Hey, look at this guy.

47:23.740 --> 47:26.140
Hey, what'd you fuck,
a Foot Locker mannequin?

47:26.810 --> 47:28.243
Hey, you look good. You look great.

47:28.312 --> 47:30.303
Hey Joey, Joey, show my boy...

47:30.380 --> 47:33.076
Show my boy the oldest trick in the book.
Show him how to out- crazy a guy.

47:33.150 --> 47:34.310
- Oh, the threaten thing?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:34.384 --> 47:35.442
I can do that. Okay.

47:35.652 --> 47:37.119
Say someone threatens you.

47:37.187 --> 47:39.917
You gotta come back with them
with something crazier

47:39.990 --> 47:41.548
and then you throw in a stare.

47:41.625 --> 47:43.616
Okay, so, come at me. Threaten me.

47:44.595 --> 47:46.426
- Okay.
- Give him something. Give him something.

47:46.496 --> 47:48.623
- Let's go, Marty.
- You need to move outta the way,

47:48.699 --> 47:51.167
or I'm gonna fuck your sister at

47:52.236 --> 47:54.067
5:45 next Friday.

47:54.371 --> 47:56.168
Wow. That was, that was too specific.

47:56.473 --> 47:57.872
After lunch?

47:58.408 --> 47:59.773
That's a little specific.

48:00.177 --> 48:01.508
Yeah. Let's try to be a
little more general.

48:02.613 --> 48:03.807
Come at me again.

48:04.414 --> 48:05.904
All right. Hey, hey!

48:06.316 --> 48:08.284
I'll fuck your grandma,

48:08.919 --> 48:10.853
next month, a bunch of times,

48:11.154 --> 48:13.213
if you don't move out of my way.

48:13.457 --> 48:15.186
You fuck my grandmother,
I'll rip your dick off,

48:15.259 --> 48:16.920
I'll shove it down your throat,
I'll make you shit it out!

48:16.994 --> 48:19.258
And then I'll make you swallow it again!
Do you understand me?

48:19.329 --> 48:22.821
No, I don't want to fuck her for real.
I was just...

48:23.000 --> 48:25.696
All right, all right, all right.
Tap, tap, tap.

48:25.769 --> 48:27.760
- See how that works? See how that works?
- That's right.

48:27.838 --> 48:29.328
You guys ready? Let's go!

48:31.141 --> 48:32.631
Come on, Marty.

48:34.177 --> 48:35.940
You're beasts! You guys are beasts!

48:36.013 --> 48:39.676
One, two, three. Red! Red! Red!

48:39.750 --> 48:41.411
Yeah! That's it.

48:41.485 --> 48:42.611
- Hi.
- How are you?

48:49.192 --> 48:51.057
Wow, impressive!

48:51.261 --> 48:54.321
Why don't you bean the kid
and force a double play?

48:54.398 --> 48:57.026
Now let's see what you got
when my boy steps up!

48:59.002 --> 49:01.994
Let's see if you got anything
for the slider here, you little shit.

49:02.072 --> 49:04.597
Okay, Junior, swing for it!

49:06.009 --> 49:08.705
Look at the ballerina! Nice throw!

49:09.212 --> 49:10.304
Come on!

49:10.881 --> 49:12.974
Look, he's throwing heat over here.

49:13.450 --> 49:14.508
He can't do that.

49:14.985 --> 49:17.647
I think this guy's kinda
crazy in the head, Mom.

49:18.388 --> 49:19.878
All right, Junior.

49:20.223 --> 49:22.384
Swing for it, all the way.

49:22.726 --> 49:24.318
Take ‘em yard!

49:24.494 --> 49:26.792
You better check yourself, playboy!

49:27.364 --> 49:28.353
Yeah.

49:32.936 --> 49:35.632
Yeah, yeah, yeah, run, run, run.
Dig it, dig it, dig it.

49:35.706 --> 49:36.968
Go, go, go. 90!

49:37.040 --> 49:40.009
- You got it, you got it. Oh, come on.
- Yes!

49:40.143 --> 49:41.804
What are you, a bad dad?

49:42.012 --> 49:43.843
You knocked him down,
what's wrong with you?

49:43.914 --> 49:45.142
Who are you trying to impress?

49:45.215 --> 49:47.877
You got scouts watching?
You going pro? What's up?

49:47.985 --> 49:49.213
What are you talking about?

49:49.286 --> 49:51.254
If I lob it in,
everybody's gonna get on the base

49:51.321 --> 49:52.379
and no one's gonna learn.

49:52.489 --> 49:54.616
I see how it is.
Well, why don't you give me the ball

49:54.691 --> 49:56.386
and I'll brush your kid off the plate?

49:56.593 --> 49:58.618
Hey shit- dick, you wanna threaten me,
that's one thing,

49:58.695 --> 50:00.663
you wanna threaten my kid
that's another thing, okay?

50:00.731 --> 50:02.699
I'll make two phone calls
and in the morning

50:02.766 --> 50:04.324
there will be a moving truck
outside your house

50:04.401 --> 50:05.800
and you'll be crying like a little baby!

50:06.436 --> 50:07.425
What the hell does that mean?

50:07.504 --> 50:10.200
That means I'll suck the snot
outta your nose and spit it in your mouth,

50:10.273 --> 50:11.297
okay, shit stain?

50:11.375 --> 50:12.899
Fuck him up, Dad!

50:13.176 --> 50:15.974
You got that? I'm the fucking Mike Tyson of
this Little League shit.

50:16.046 --> 50:17.035
You understand me, pencil dick?

50:17.447 --> 50:19.381
- You understand, fuck nuts?
- Yeah, yeah!

50:19.616 --> 50:21.174
Can I get help over here?

50:24.121 --> 50:27.454
Thank you for untucking those balls, baby.
You did it!

50:27.591 --> 50:29.991
My teeth... Has my tooth fallen out?

50:30.694 --> 50:31.820
And here we go.

50:31.895 --> 50:33.658
- Is it loose?
- No. You're fine.

50:34.197 --> 50:37.598
You did good. Honey? Honey? Two outs.
Two outs. You gotta get back out there.

50:37.667 --> 50:41.296
Get back out there.
Do it. Bring the fury! Yes!

50:41.371 --> 50:44.306
I'm gonna screw you on a cruise ship
on a Thursday in bad weather!

50:44.408 --> 50:47.309
I'm gonna give it to you.
Mama's gonna give it to you!

50:47.844 --> 50:49.004
Marty!

50:49.312 --> 50:50.802
That's some good shit, man!

50:50.947 --> 50:51.936
Danny?

50:52.149 --> 50:54.515
Hey, buddy, what do you think, man?

50:54.584 --> 50:55.676
It's pretty cool, right?

50:56.219 --> 50:58.084
Fuck a roof over your head, man.

50:58.522 --> 50:59.921
- It's awesome, what?
- You can't camp out in the park.

50:59.990 --> 51:00.979
Run, Danny!

51:01.491 --> 51:03.584
- Hey, man, I pay taxes!
- Sir, sir.

51:03.693 --> 51:05.888
- Don't, don't tase me, man!
- Yeah.

51:07.064 --> 51:08.156
Yeah.

51:09.032 --> 51:10.124
All right, two outs!

51:10.667 --> 51:13.158
It was a good thing I wasn't there.
I go crazy with that kind of stuff.

51:13.236 --> 51:15.500
Wow, you haven't been in a fight
since high school, babe.

51:15.705 --> 51:18.037
Not that you've seen. I go low pro.

51:18.108 --> 51:20.736
- Low pro.
- I keep my skills concealed.

51:20.811 --> 51:21.800
Concealed.

51:22.145 --> 51:23.373
Talk about me, that's one thing.

51:23.447 --> 51:25.438
Talk about my son,
that's a whole other thing.

51:25.749 --> 51:27.046
Full- blown anxiety attack?

51:27.384 --> 51:29.579
You saw me out there, sweetie.
The guy got lucky.

51:29.653 --> 51:31.712
I'm surprised more guys
don't get the shit kicked out of them

51:31.788 --> 51:32.846
at Little League games.

51:32.923 --> 51:35.016
You should be a Little League super hero!

51:35.092 --> 51:36.821
Run around beating up mean fathers.

51:37.694 --> 51:38.683
That's not the worst idea.

51:38.895 --> 51:40.385
Why are you doing that?
Don't encourage them.

51:40.464 --> 51:42.989
Hey, guys. Sorry,
we're running a little slow tonight.

51:43.066 --> 51:44.124
What can I get you to start?

51:44.201 --> 51:46.692
You know what,
can I get a Rusty Spoon, please?

51:47.804 --> 51:48.828
A what?

51:49.406 --> 51:51.931
You know what, why don't we
start with four Midnight Nipples.

51:52.008 --> 51:54.841
You know, I'm sorry, instead,
let me get a Bang Bang Neighbor.

51:54.911 --> 51:57.106
I'll get a Communist Hooker Sprite,
on second thought.

51:57.180 --> 51:59.205
Scratch that, let's get
two Ass To Mouths...

51:59.282 --> 52:00.909
I don't want an Ass To Mouth,

52:01.017 --> 52:03.645
but I do want a Detroit Working Girl.

52:03.720 --> 52:05.813
That works for him,
but you know what, I want a rare vodka.

52:05.922 --> 52:08.652
- It's called a Bieber- Bangs Stoli?
Straight. - You know what?

52:08.725 --> 52:09.885
This is getting too complicated.

52:09.960 --> 52:12.485
Why don't we just start with
High Country Crotch Rockets...

52:12.562 --> 52:13.586
For everybody. Four, please.

52:13.663 --> 52:15.255
Okay, enough. Enough.

52:16.099 --> 52:18.590
Shots of sexual harassment for you.
You're welcome.

52:18.802 --> 52:19.791
It's drink- lingo.

52:19.870 --> 52:21.861
What's the matter,
we go too much swagger for the 'burbs?

52:21.938 --> 52:23.064
You don't have
any of those drinks, sweetie?

52:23.140 --> 52:26.439
Paul, the boys will have juice boxes,

52:26.510 --> 52:30.412
and the two of us will enjoy
a very expensive bottle of Chardonnay.

52:30.480 --> 52:32.277
Can you put some beer
in those juice boxes?

52:32.349 --> 52:34.010
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

52:35.352 --> 52:38.048
Marty, why don't you come with me
to yoga tomorrow?

52:38.121 --> 52:40.419
Work on that thing
that's happening right now.

52:40.690 --> 52:43.591
I don't wanna go to yoga.
I mean, if it was Crossfit or TRX,

52:43.660 --> 52:46.026
or something like that,
maybe, but yoga, it's kinda easy.

52:46.429 --> 52:48.624
Is it that super sexy yoga teacher
you were telling me about?

52:49.366 --> 52:50.856
Why, yes, Liz, it is.

52:50.934 --> 52:53.300
- The super sexy yoga teacher.
- Yes.

52:53.370 --> 52:55.895
We're going to work on
the plow pose tomorrow.

52:55.972 --> 52:57.303
- Plow pose.
- To do what?

52:57.374 --> 52:58.363
He's going to plow me.

52:58.808 --> 53:00.241
Who's going to plow what? Who?

53:00.610 --> 53:04.307
And he is...Latino.

53:06.216 --> 53:10.084
Reach your heart towards the sun
and give thanks.

53:11.054 --> 53:12.681
Breathe in.

53:14.357 --> 53:20.057
Understand that we hold memories
of our past in our bodies.

53:20.130 --> 53:21.620
So when you stretch,

53:21.698 --> 53:25.964
you may experience some emotions
that are uncomfortable.

53:26.036 --> 53:29.130
Now, let's lift our leg to the sky.

53:29.206 --> 53:30.230
And breathe.

53:34.144 --> 53:35.839
Fuck the third grade!

53:38.615 --> 53:40.412
All right, everybody, if you're thinking

53:40.483 --> 53:43.008
you want to make your house
more energy- efficient,

53:43.086 --> 53:45.554
you better make sure you can afford it.

53:45.622 --> 53:48.682
So I want you to
go to suzeorman.com right now,

53:48.792 --> 53:50.885
tell me what it is that you want to do

53:50.961 --> 53:54.362
and I'll tell you if you
can afford it or not!

53:55.498 --> 53:56.931
All right. I think somebody's out there.

53:57.300 --> 53:59.928
Hey, who's next. Hello?
Are you out there? You on?

54:00.136 --> 54:01.330
Oh, God.

54:02.505 --> 54:05.201
Did somebody just say God is calling me?

54:05.275 --> 54:07.368
Listen, if you're God, I gotta tell you,

54:07.444 --> 54:10.140
I have been waiting
my entire lifetime for you to call.

54:10.213 --> 54:12.374
Please don't tell me
that you're broke, too.

54:12.449 --> 54:15.475
No. Suze, hey, this is
Paul from New Jersey.

54:15.552 --> 54:19.044
Paul, I can barely hear you,
so go ahead, Whispering Paul.

54:19.122 --> 54:21.647
Okay, here's the thing,
my wife spends money like...

54:21.725 --> 54:24.819
$1,000 on a pair of shoes,
$2,500 on a purse.

54:24.894 --> 54:27.863
She acts like they're investments.
They're gonna outperform the SMB 500.

54:28.231 --> 54:29.721
Are these good purchases?

54:29.799 --> 54:33.360
Did you just ask me
if these are good purchases?

54:33.436 --> 54:34.926
Are you kidding?

54:35.005 --> 54:37.701
But listen, boyfriend,
I'm not here to judge

54:37.774 --> 54:40.265
what you or your wife wants to buy.

54:40.377 --> 54:43.437
I'm here to tell you
if you can afford it or not.

54:43.513 --> 54:46.812
So open up one of her purses
and just simply show me the money, Paul.

54:47.851 --> 54:50.513
I make around about
$21,000 month in income.

54:51.054 --> 54:53.284
Good. I have to tell you,
that's great income.

54:53.390 --> 54:56.382
Yeah, but I spend about $25,000 month.

54:56.459 --> 54:59.257
Wait, excuse me? Did you just say that

54:59.329 --> 55:01.729
your income is $21, 000,

55:01.798 --> 55:03.663
but you're spending $25, 000,

55:03.733 --> 55:07.931
so you are already 34,
000 a month in deficit?

55:08.004 --> 55:10.336
This is exactly why I'm calling you,
I'm living in a madhouse!

55:10.407 --> 55:12.898
You know, I gotta wake up,
I gotta make $15,000 a month

55:12.976 --> 55:14.568
just to wake up, the way she spends.

55:14.644 --> 55:15.975
It's crazy! And it's scaring me!

55:16.179 --> 55:18.306
Well, it should be scaring you.

55:18.381 --> 55:21.441
Does your wife even have a clue that
you don't have enough money

55:21.518 --> 55:23.008
to pay your bills every month?

55:23.086 --> 55:24.246
I don't think so.

55:24.321 --> 55:25.913
What do you mean you don't think so?

55:25.989 --> 55:29.356
Listen, boyfriend,
you make really good money,

55:29.426 --> 55:31.223
but the fact that you make so much

55:31.294 --> 55:34.422
and you're spending
more than you make is a travesty.

55:34.531 --> 55:38.262
You are so wrong
and here is what you need to know.

55:38.335 --> 55:40.132
You are denied!

55:40.470 --> 55:43.439
In fact, your wife should
take all the purses,

55:43.506 --> 55:47.602
all the shoes she has ever purchased
and sell them on eBay.

55:47.911 --> 55:49.310
Thank you.

55:49.412 --> 55:51.710
Thank you.
It's so good to hear a sane voice!

55:51.781 --> 55:52.975
I'll tell you something else she does...

55:53.049 --> 55:56.075
Are you discussing our relationship
with Suze Orman?

55:59.456 --> 56:02.516
I don't... No. I don't think so.

56:03.059 --> 56:04.959
- Paul!
- Okay.

56:06.996 --> 56:08.930
Now, I figure
the next lesson should be spontaneity.

56:09.032 --> 56:11.728
Women love it.
Men, they don't even know what it is.

56:12.335 --> 56:14.132
All right, boys, class is
in session, all right?

56:14.204 --> 56:16.570
Let's get into the issue.
Marty, what are you wearing?

56:17.440 --> 56:18.930
These are my capris.

56:19.342 --> 56:21.503
- It's comfortable.
- Well, it's not comfortable for us.

56:22.445 --> 56:24.640
- I like it.
- None of my moves are working.

56:24.714 --> 56:25.908
- Well, that's because they're moves.
- Right.

56:26.015 --> 56:27.277
Moves are for amateurs.

56:28.918 --> 56:30.545
I'm going to buy her
a really nice purse, I think.

56:30.620 --> 56:32.019
- That's always worked in the past.
- Do that. Do that.

56:32.088 --> 56:34.682
But buying a gift as an apology
went out years ago.

56:34.758 --> 56:35.747
Yeah.

56:35.859 --> 56:37.759
What women want is spontaneity.

56:37.827 --> 56:39.761
- They want a surprise, right?
- Yeah.

56:39.863 --> 56:41.387
No, my wife don't like surprises.

56:41.598 --> 56:43.065
All women like surprises, Marty.

56:43.133 --> 56:46.125
No, trust me, okay?
We threw a surprise party a few years ago.

56:46.202 --> 56:47.464
She walked in, we said "Surprise."

56:47.537 --> 56:49.664
She said "Fuck off,"
smacked my face and left!

56:49.739 --> 56:51.104
Okay, she said I invited all her enemies.

56:51.241 --> 56:52.299
I don't need that shit.

56:52.475 --> 56:54.602
Clarissa, maybe if I, you know,
if! made out with you,

56:54.677 --> 56:56.042
it'd make things a little better, you know.

56:56.112 --> 56:57.272
- Help me through this?
- Paul?

56:57.647 --> 56:59.205
- You're a dickhead.
- Okay.

56:59.282 --> 57:01.182
Okay, okay. Here we go.

57:01.885 --> 57:04.285
So, your wife is sitting on the couch,

57:04.687 --> 57:07.087
watching TV, or reading a book

57:07.157 --> 57:08.249
or having some ice cream, right?

57:08.792 --> 57:09.816
- Yeah.
- Okay.

57:09.893 --> 57:12.384
Let me tell you,
this works in almost every country, too.

57:12.462 --> 57:14.453
I tried this on an Ecuadorian super model,

57:14.531 --> 57:16.522
she slept with me for six months.
She even moved in for awhile.

57:16.599 --> 57:18.191
How'd you get her out of your house?

57:18.334 --> 57:19.767
I had her deported on a visa loophole.

57:19.836 --> 57:21.269
- Okay, stop talking.
- He's the best.

57:21.337 --> 57:22.463
- Watch how this works, guys.
- Best.

57:22.539 --> 57:23.528
- Watch.
- Okay, right?

57:24.007 --> 57:26.737
So she's reading a book.
She's reading a book, right?

57:26.810 --> 57:29.938
You kinda slide up behind her,
move in and...

57:30.079 --> 57:31.273
Boom! Right?

57:31.748 --> 57:33.613
You go in for the kiss, you're kissing.

57:33.683 --> 57:35.412
Boom, boom, boom, kissing.

57:35.485 --> 57:37.009
She's not paying attention.

57:37.086 --> 57:40.886
You slide down, grab the hand,
look who's happy now.

57:40.957 --> 57:42.424
And I'm so shocked by this move,

57:42.492 --> 57:44.517
that I don't even notice
that I'm walking away.

57:45.995 --> 57:47.360
God damn it!

57:47.430 --> 57:48.692
Fucking shit...

57:49.065 --> 57:50.532
All right, guys, write this down.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.059
That's known as the Happy Kidnap.

57:54.537 --> 57:56.266
- You got a pen?
- I don't have a pen.

57:59.108 --> 58:00.132
Hello.

58:02.212 --> 58:04.339
Wow. Those are... fitted.

58:04.581 --> 58:08.574
Oh, no, this is just what happens
when you're this muscular.

58:08.651 --> 58:10.209
You just kinda bust out of your shirts.

58:10.286 --> 58:11.913
Is that a unitard?

58:12.155 --> 58:15.090
It is not a unitard, but I am going
to take that as a compliment.

58:16.626 --> 58:18.287
I tucked my shirt in

58:18.361 --> 58:20.955
so I can show you what I'm working with.

58:22.131 --> 58:23.223
What's this?

58:23.333 --> 58:26.359
Just a little something
to tell you that I love you.

58:27.403 --> 58:28.665
Baby, ouch!

58:28.738 --> 58:31.070
Those are my extensions!
That's not my real hair.

58:31.140 --> 58:32.334
- Really?
- No.

58:32.408 --> 58:34.137
- I mean it's partly my hair.
- Whose hair is it?

58:34.210 --> 58:35.837
The hair of angels?

58:35.945 --> 58:38.140
What is up with the moves?

58:38.214 --> 58:40.114
And the pants, and...

58:40.183 --> 58:43.812
I'm just hanging out.
I thought maybe you'd like to take a break.

58:43.887 --> 58:46.583
- Emily is right upstairs.
- She is. Yeah, I know that.

58:46.656 --> 58:48.590
- She's sound asleep.
- How do you know?

58:49.158 --> 58:52.924
Because I have sexual psychic powers.

58:52.996 --> 58:55.089
Well, do you think
you could tell your sexual psychic powers

58:55.198 --> 58:57.359
maybe just to wait
until I'm finished with this chapter?

58:57.433 --> 58:59.298
I can do that, but you know what?

58:59.369 --> 59:02.395
I'm checking your pulse
and I don't think you're fit to read.

59:02.472 --> 59:04.531
I think you need to come upstairs
and lie down.

59:04.607 --> 59:09.067
I don't have much more. I'm already on 201
and the chapter ends on 204.

59:09.612 --> 59:10.840
So that's like three pages.

59:10.914 --> 59:13.144
- That must be a really good book, then.
- It's good.

59:13.216 --> 59:15.241
I read fast, babe. I'll
see you in a minute.

59:15.318 --> 59:17.445
I'll go upstairs, then.

59:17.520 --> 59:20.080
That's good. This is good...

59:21.324 --> 59:22.985
Thank you, baby. Wow, wow.

59:23.059 --> 59:24.754
Those pants have really,

59:25.962 --> 59:30.160
efficient bun- cupping action.
They're like man- Spanx.

59:30.466 --> 59:33.492
No, they're not. I just have
a very well- developed lower body.

59:33.570 --> 59:36.334
- You do. They cup your buns.
- Yeah, well. You're welcome.

59:56.793 --> 59:59.023
"To the most special person in my life.

59:59.095 --> 01:00:02.622
"The words on this page
could never do justice. I love you.

01:00:03.933 --> 01:00:06.902
"Happy Kwanzaa,
my African American queen."

01:00:10.406 --> 01:00:11.600
Paul...

01:00:14.143 --> 01:00:15.405
So close.

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:19.508
You know, watching the boys
fight for their relationships

01:00:19.582 --> 01:00:21.345
was a great thing to see.

01:00:21.417 --> 01:00:25.217
But it also made me realize that
I hadn't fought for anyone in along time.

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:27.620
My life was a hard habit to break.

01:00:33.162 --> 01:00:34.254
To masturbation!

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:37.857
Hey. girls!

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:39.629
- Oh my God!
- Hi!

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:41.934
Hon, oh, no, who died? Why are you here?

01:00:42.005 --> 01:00:44.769
Oh, stop it. I figured I'd just drop in
and see how you're doing, you know.

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:46.570
Catch up on everything. What's going on?

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:48.702
Oh, my God, how cute. So cute!

01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:51.542
Look at that, see this is exactly,
exactly what I'm talking about.

01:00:51.614 --> 01:00:54.174
It amazes me that you can be
in business with my husband

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:55.877
and yet none of this rubs off on him.

01:00:55.952 --> 01:00:58.420
But, girls... What's happening?

01:00:58.488 --> 01:01:00.888
Nothing. I just wanted to catch up,
gossip it up a little bit.

01:01:00.957 --> 01:01:02.515
You know, hang out,
spend some time with you.

01:01:02.592 --> 01:01:04.287
Hey, did you watch Mob Wives last night?

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:05.452
- I totally did!
- Did you see it?

01:01:05.528 --> 01:01:08.554
I used to love Drita, she was my favorite
but Big Ang, she's the best!

01:01:08.631 --> 01:01:10.030
- I couldn't agree more!
- Is she not the best?

01:01:10.099 --> 01:01:11.430
- She is so awesome.
- Absolutely, 100%. Oh, my God.

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:12.968
- Marty, here, this is for you!
- Thank you, thank you.

01:01:13.036 --> 01:01:15.436
You know what, we're actually just
finishing up, sweetie. So, you know.

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:17.996
All right,
so what are you guys doing after that?

01:01:18.074 --> 01:01:19.701
Just a ladies day.

01:01:19.776 --> 01:01:21.334
- All right! Great!
- Cheers.

01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:28.247
I swear I needed this more than
you could ever imagine!

01:01:28.818 --> 01:01:33.278
Isn't it amazing how a simple pedicure
will just brighten your whole day?

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:36.618
Sweetie, my toe has shriveled up
like a prune!

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:38.854
It looks like E.T.

01:01:38.928 --> 01:01:41.692
E.T. toe home. E.T. toe home.

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:49.299
Linda and her spiritual journey.

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:51.863
I'm thinking,
why not be spiritual when you're married?

01:01:51.941 --> 01:01:53.875
You get a divorce and now you're meditating

01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:57.379
and taking trips to a vortex in New Mexico?

01:01:57.447 --> 01:01:58.971
Come on, give me a break.

01:01:59.048 --> 01:02:01.846
Yeah. I didn't trust her husband
when I met him.

01:02:01.918 --> 01:02:05.012
The guy had a weak handshake.
My gut said "cheater" from the get- go.

01:02:06.189 --> 01:02:08.316
Sweets, why are my calves so sensitive?

01:02:08.424 --> 01:02:11.052
It's the only part of my body
I can't take pain in.

01:02:12.261 --> 01:02:13.387
Quiet time.

01:02:14.497 --> 01:02:16.829
- It's just, I don't understand it...
- Babe!

01:02:20.103 --> 01:02:22.970
All right, always cuddle
according to the mood, right?

01:02:23.039 --> 01:02:24.939
There are three stages of the cuddle.

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:26.907
First of all there's the ''All in."

01:02:26.976 --> 01:02:30.377
That is to be used after a perfect evening
or a post- traumatic fight.

01:02:30.446 --> 01:02:32.937
Then you have the ''I'm Still Here," right?

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:36.685
A little touch indicating, you know,
that you love them, you care about them,

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:39.187
but you're tired, but you're still there.

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:40.688
And then, of course,
you have "The Reverse Spoon,"

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:43.658
to be avoided at all costs unless
you're absolutely exhausted, all right?

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.985
Listen, I read on Google once

01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:48.724
that cuddling can cut off
the circulation to your heart.

01:02:48.798 --> 01:02:50.129
So I'm not comfortable with all this.

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:52.659
- Clarissa?
- Yes, okay.

01:02:53.669 --> 01:02:57.070
Here we go. Paul, get down here.

01:02:58.007 --> 01:02:58.996
You wanna try this, don't you?

01:02:59.809 --> 01:03:01.140
Yes! Yeah.

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:03.405
Wait, what the...
Why does he always get to go first?

01:03:42.084 --> 01:03:43.346
Oh, man, that was...

01:03:43.419 --> 01:03:45.353
Guys, you go home
and hold onto your wives, all right?

01:03:45.421 --> 01:03:47.685
All right, I appreciate it.
I think this really helped.

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:50.088
But I'm a little sore,
but I think I'm good. Thank you.

01:03:50.159 --> 01:03:51.683
- Okay, all right.
- You're welcome.

01:03:51.794 --> 01:03:54.456
- Talk to you tomorrow. See you guys.
- Thanks. Awesome.

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:56.657
And Mike, she's gonna love this!

01:03:58.968 --> 01:04:00.765
I think you're doing
something really great here.

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:02.828
- We shall see.
- Yep.

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:05.339
Okay. Well, I will see you at the bar.

01:04:05.408 --> 01:04:06.841
- Tomorrow. Yeah.
- Okay.

01:04:06.909 --> 01:04:08.069
All right.

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:09.975
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye.

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:25.793
- I'll see you at work.
- Okay. See you at work.

01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:27.762
- Bye. Don't be late.
- Bye. Yeah.

01:04:41.911 --> 01:04:43.435
My beautiful wife...

01:04:43.512 --> 01:04:46.709
- Paul! Spine! Jesus!
- Sorry.

01:04:55.524 --> 01:04:59.620
God, you smell so damn good.

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:02.897
Paul, that is my jugular.
Please, baby, just go to sleep.

01:05:02.965 --> 01:05:04.057
ok3Y- 

01:05:06.502 --> 01:05:08.299
I'm just a little tired.

01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:11.499
Paul. Your penis is in my lower lumbar.

01:05:12.308 --> 01:05:14.469
- It is?
- You're fucking my C7.

01:05:14.944 --> 01:05:16.605
- Is that bad?
- Yes!

01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:19.646
ok3Y- 

01:05:26.255 --> 01:05:28.086
Ass to ass? Paul, really?

01:05:28.157 --> 01:05:30.921
- I'm doing my thing.
- Just do it further over there.

01:05:31.027 --> 01:05:34.827
All right, okay, sorry.
I didn't know you were allergic to me.

01:05:36.565 --> 01:05:40.365
Emily's recital is on Saturday.
Do not forget and do not make plans.

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:45.597
Is that... The recital, that's
in the afternoon, right?

01:05:46.809 --> 01:05:47.833
No.

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:52.773
Babe,

01:05:54.183 --> 01:05:56.151
that's the night
we're taking the Australians out.

01:05:56.218 --> 01:05:58.277
Somehow they let us back
in the race for this deal.

01:05:58.354 --> 01:06:00.948
I'm sorry. This is the one

01:06:01.023 --> 01:06:03.423
night I cannot miss.

01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:07.657
I know I can close this deal.

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.791
You reminded me about this a lot, right?

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:22.873
I'm gonna join you, sweets!

01:06:23.412 --> 01:06:26.745
The new me is the old me,
and the old me is back.

01:06:27.316 --> 01:06:29.876
Marty, I don't need the old you.

01:06:29.952 --> 01:06:33.183
- This you is fine.
- Well, maybe just a little bit of him.

01:06:33.622 --> 01:06:35.249
- Yeah, maybe a dash.
- Okay.

01:06:35.324 --> 01:06:36.348
Minus the whole vest thing.

01:06:36.659 --> 01:06:38.650
- You can never be too careful.
- Hey, Marty!

01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:40.626
She got everything but the bike, man.

01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:43.158
The bike's all mine!

01:06:44.033 --> 01:06:46.297
She got everything
but the bike in the settlement.

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:47.996
- Oh, wow.
- Holy shit.

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:50.538
She'll try and take this one from me,
but I'm not gonna let her!

01:06:50.639 --> 01:06:53.335
- Yeah, fuck ‘em, Danny.
- Really?

01:06:53.409 --> 01:06:55.639
- I love you guys.
- Love you, too.

01:06:56.178 --> 01:06:58.009
I gotta go. I think
somebody's following me.

01:06:58.414 --> 01:07:00.006
All right, Danny!

01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:02.016
Oh, poor Danny...

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:04.313
All right, let's go.
Seriously, babe, the vest?

01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:06.719
Hey, does Superman wear a cape? Let's go.

01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:08.552
What, are you helping
kids cross the street? Come on!

01:07:08.624 --> 01:07:09.648
Let's get it in!

01:07:09.725 --> 01:07:11.488
Yeah, let's get it in, Marty. Come on.

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.027
- Give me the old Marty.
- I'm here.

01:07:13.095 --> 01:07:15.086
Yeah! Put it in, baby!

01:07:16.465 --> 01:07:18.456
Shares of Marty went up today
as he learned that

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:20.900
just showing up in your wife's life
means a lot.

01:07:39.288 --> 01:07:42.155
Things were looking up for Mike,
but let's hope it's not too late.

01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:45.091
His stock was soaring,
and took a downturn this afternoon,

01:07:45.161 --> 01:07:46.253
dropping eight points.

01:07:52.935 --> 01:07:55.768
Hey, baby. Sorry,
I'm gonna be home pretty late, I think.

01:07:56.272 --> 01:07:59.002
- I'll see you later. What's this?
- Your bag.

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:01.938
- For what? My bag?
- I need you out of the house.

01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:05.710
What are you talking about? Why?

01:08:05.781 --> 01:08:07.806
It's not a yes or no, Paul.
I already talked to Emily.

01:08:07.883 --> 01:08:09.874
I want you out. I need some time.

01:08:09.952 --> 01:08:11.647
We're working this out. I'm fixing this.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.984
This isn't something
that can be fixed right now.

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:18.654
Look, I'm sorry
I'm going to miss the recital, okay?

01:08:18.727 --> 01:08:20.921
But this is the biggest
meeting of our lives.

01:08:20.996 --> 01:08:22.224
What do you think
pays the bills around here?

01:08:22.298 --> 01:08:23.925
What do you think puts designer shoes

01:08:23.999 --> 01:08:25.626
and designer bags on you
and all the other shit?

01:08:25.701 --> 01:08:26.689
All the other shit?

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:28.236
See that's exactly what it is, it's shit.

01:08:28.337 --> 01:08:30.430
- I couldn't give a shit! Look at me!
- What do you want from me?

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:32.337
What do you want from me?
I'm doing everything I can.

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:34.000
Something so simple!
Just turn around. Turn around.

01:08:34.076 --> 01:08:35.600
- Turn around?
- Turn around!

01:08:35.711 --> 01:08:37.076
Just do it!

01:08:38.013 --> 01:08:39.707
What color am I wearing?

01:08:40.983 --> 01:08:42.746
Is my hair up or down?

01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:47.084
Did you see Emily
before she left for school this morning?

01:08:47.156 --> 01:08:48.555
Yes.

01:08:48.624 --> 01:08:49.921
What did she have on?

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:52.254
You know what, I'll make it easy for you.

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:54.421
Was she wearing pants or shorts?

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:56.089
Could you see her knees?

01:09:00.603 --> 01:09:02.468
Just come back when you can be here.

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:04.732
Just...

01:09:06.308 --> 01:09:09.277
And that's how we got here.

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:10.607
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:12.406
I'll get a hotel.

01:09:12.915 --> 01:09:15.212
What? No, come in. This is Amy.

01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:17.145
Laura.

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:19.381
I gotta crash for the night.

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:21.183
For sure. Come on.

01:09:21.756 --> 01:09:22.814
You okay?

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:25.917
Let me know if my package gets here.
I had something overnighted.

01:09:27.662 --> 01:09:29.688
Maybe I'd be happier with that and this.

01:09:29.798 --> 01:09:32.595
Maybe I'd be a better father
if I did what you do.

01:09:32.667 --> 01:09:34.385
Oh, no, no, no, no. I
can't let you do this.

01:09:34.398 --> 01:09:36.126
The single life
is not for you.

01:09:36.404 --> 01:09:37.531
Two weeks in the single life

01:09:37.606 --> 01:09:39.938
and you'd end up in the ER
with all kinds of shit.

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:42.307
You'd be limping for no reason.

01:09:42.611 --> 01:09:44.135
No way, my friend.

01:09:44.212 --> 01:09:45.339
This life is not for you.

01:09:45.413 --> 01:09:48.144
You got nobody to stress you out
when you walk in the door.

01:09:48.216 --> 01:09:51.084
You know, you got nobody to point out
your flaws on a daily basis.

01:09:51.153 --> 01:09:52.346
No one.

01:09:53.923 --> 01:09:55.481
Not for you, buddy.

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:57.853
Not for you.

01:10:51.747 --> 01:10:53.612
Hey. How'd you sleep?

01:10:53.682 --> 01:10:54.944
I didn't.

01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:56.074
I don't know, Mike.

01:10:56.151 --> 01:10:58.915
Maybe I just need more time
on this side of the fence.

01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:00.387
- Really?
- I think so.

01:11:00.556 --> 01:11:02.956
No, maybe you're right.
I mean, my life is great.

01:11:03.025 --> 01:11:06.654
You know, I have no one to nag me,
no one to tell me where to be at any time.

01:11:06.996 --> 01:11:08.020
Exactly.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:10.588
I also don't have a beautiful
little daughter to run into my arms

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:13.191
and tell me how much she loves me
at the end of a hard day's work.

01:11:13.402 --> 01:11:16.667
Or a wife who's going stand by my side,
God forbid something happens to me.

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:17.796
So when you say to me, "Mike,

01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:20.505
"your life is great, man,
you don't have any strings.

01:11:20.576 --> 01:11:23.568
"You have no one to hassle you,
you have no one to worry about."

01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:25.305
You're right. I don't.

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:31.811
Also in my crazy, frenetic life
that you're so in awe of...

01:11:32.755 --> 01:11:34.848
I've been late on three payments to the bar

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:38.256
and they're threatening to file suit
if I don't pay six months in advance,

01:11:38.327 --> 01:11:39.316
which I don't have.

01:11:39.628 --> 01:11:41.425
- Whoa! I didn't know that.
- No, no, no.

01:11:41.497 --> 01:11:43.795
It's fine. It's my life.
I'll take care of it. But...

01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:47.168
Please don't leave my sister alone.

01:11:47.236 --> 01:11:49.101
You don't want my life.

01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:00.141
You look good.

01:12:00.215 --> 01:12:01.876
Yeah, I feel good.

01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:05.078
Today I peed standing up
and remembered to take my pills.

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:06.143
It was a big day around here.

01:12:07.823 --> 01:12:10.951
You look a little tired. Are you all right?

01:12:12.494 --> 01:12:16.157
- You and Mom had a good thing, right?
- Yeah.

01:12:17.066 --> 01:12:18.761
How'd you make that work for so long?

01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:20.534
I kept my mouth shut,

01:12:20.602 --> 01:12:23.571
I agreed with everything she said
and I slept around a little bit.

01:12:23.639 --> 01:12:25.504
- Dad!
" "1 Joking_

01:12:25.574 --> 01:12:28.509
I just think Paul is
screwing up on purpose.

01:12:29.445 --> 01:12:32.209
Well, Carlin said it best, I think.

01:12:32.281 --> 01:12:34.249
"Men are stupid. Women are crazy."

01:12:34.516 --> 01:12:36.143
That's what you got for me?

01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:38.083
"Men are stupid, women are crazy"?

01:12:38.721 --> 01:12:40.086
Listen, sweetheart,

01:12:41.924 --> 01:12:43.789
I'm sure Paul's going
to do the right thing.

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:45.957
I'm sure he will.

01:12:48.263 --> 01:12:50.629
Mike, I'm telling you. I can't tell
you how much I appreciate this.

01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:52.166
My pleasure, I got you covered.

01:12:52.234 --> 01:12:54.293
Your boys are gonna, they're going to
pay double for your company

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:55.667
by the time I'm done with them.

01:12:55.738 --> 01:12:58.298
We got girls, we got alcohol,
Clarissa is bringing some of her friends.

01:12:58.374 --> 01:12:59.898
Good, good, good, good. All right, good.

01:12:59.975 --> 01:13:01.704
- Yo, yo, yo, Mikey G.
- Hey, how are you?

01:13:01.777 --> 01:13:04.007
- How you doing, guys?
- Good, good, good, good.

01:13:05.581 --> 01:13:08.141
I'll give you some dough,
give you some dough.

01:13:08.851 --> 01:13:10.876
Noah tells me you have
some businessmen coming

01:13:10.953 --> 01:13:12.887
and we are to ensure their good time.

01:13:12.955 --> 01:13:15.685
Yeah. Every 24 minutes,
send over a new girl to socialize.

01:13:15.758 --> 01:13:18.158
I want to keep them distracted yet focused.

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:19.819
Damn, Tara, you look good.

01:13:19.928 --> 01:13:22.692
How's the ex and the dog situation going?

01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:24.733
- Lost the ex, kept the dog.
- Good.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.394
Three bottles of vodka,
and send over a bottle of Don Julio

01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:28.629
to step up the imagination.

01:13:28.704 --> 01:13:29.898
- All right? Good.
- You got it.

01:13:30.372 --> 01:13:32.067
You're like an orchestra conductor.

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:33.870
Yes. That I am.

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:38.179
I think of you as someone to,
Someone to

01:13:38.814 --> 01:13:40.679
Carry me through

01:13:41.216 --> 01:13:45.243
Hold me through

01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:07.068
That's Samuel's granddaughter.

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:12.008
My grandson's a scientist,
and his sister is a doctor.

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:16.949
Who cares? When are you
going to treat me like a bad girl?

01:14:18.253 --> 01:14:21.051
It takes a concert to get you
to take me on a date?

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:22.715
Who said this is a date?

01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:24.315
I'm a lesbian.

01:14:24.393 --> 01:14:27.521
Get over it. You're almost dead.
Try something new.

01:14:30.265 --> 01:14:31.857
Excuse me, guys.

01:14:39.341 --> 01:14:41.172
You think flowers are going to fix this?

01:14:41.276 --> 01:14:44.268
This is actually for Emily, not you. But...

01:14:44.346 --> 01:14:46.974
I'm going to do whatever
it takes to fix this, and you know why?

01:14:47.049 --> 01:14:49.017
Because I love you.

01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:50.783
Hydraineas.

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:52.585
Hydrangeas.

01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:54.212
Hydran... No, these are... Well.

01:14:54.289 --> 01:14:57.656
You say... That's the French way.
I say it the Latin way.

01:15:00.195 --> 01:15:02.220
You see that? That's for you.

01:15:02.664 --> 01:15:04.359
You hold onto that for me.

01:15:15.711 --> 01:15:17.235
It's good to see you, Marty.

01:15:17.312 --> 01:15:19.371
You made quite the impression
the other night.

01:15:19.448 --> 01:15:22.008
Well, I appreciate you guys coming out
for a drink this evening.

01:15:22.084 --> 01:15:24.382
Well, it's not every day
you get scolded in a strip club.

01:15:24.453 --> 01:15:26.045
I thought it was quite
an original approach.

01:15:26.121 --> 01:15:27.952
As a matter of fact,
it's the first time it's ever happened.

01:15:28.023 --> 01:15:29.581
Yeah, well a lot was going on that night.

01:15:29.658 --> 01:15:31.649
I was on antibiotics
and I had an allergic reaction

01:15:31.727 --> 01:15:32.819
to something I drank.

01:15:32.895 --> 01:15:35.295
Plus those strobe lights.
It's true that they make you crazy.

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:37.594
I'm lucky
the whole thing didn't turn into a seizure.

01:15:37.666 --> 01:15:38.758
This is my friend Mike,

01:15:38.834 --> 01:15:41.598
and he's going to hopefully make us feel
like that night never even happened.

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:42.830
How are you? Nice to see you guys.

01:15:42.905 --> 01:15:45.203
We're gonna have fun tonight.
I'd like you to meet some of my friends.

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:48.732
Janine, Elaina, Suzie and Sarah,
each and every one a virgin.

01:15:50.445 --> 01:15:51.469
I like him already.

01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:53.606
Every bunch needs a wrangler.
Cheers, Mike.

01:15:53.682 --> 01:15:55.115
Yeah, Mike's the best in the city.

01:15:55.284 --> 01:15:56.979
- That's right.
- Sit down, guys, let's have some fun.

01:15:57.052 --> 01:15:59.111
- What are you drinking?
- Vodka for me.

01:16:02.624 --> 01:16:05.115
Hey, you ever have that shooting pain
that starts in your neck

01:16:05.193 --> 01:16:06.319
and goes to your head?

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:07.623
Hey- 

01:16:09.064 --> 01:16:10.190
You brought a date.

01:16:10.766 --> 01:16:12.597
- Josh.
- Hey, Josh, how are you?

01:16:13.468 --> 01:16:14.696
Four girls not enough for you, player?

01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:16.831
Player?

01:16:18.073 --> 01:16:19.768
We'll be out on the dance floor.

01:16:23.345 --> 01:16:25.438
Sorry, we're... Champagne?

01:16:25.514 --> 01:16:26.674
- Want some champagne?
- Yeah.

01:16:26.782 --> 01:16:28.545
- No! Don't cork me! Don't cork me!
- Oh, oh, oh!

01:16:28.617 --> 01:16:30.517
Look out, Marty! Look out, Marty!

01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:32.349
Whoa! Here we go.

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:34.149
Let's get some glasses!

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.758
Listen, again,
I want to apologize about the other night.

01:16:40.829 --> 01:16:42.319
I'm sorry about the rugby stuff,

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:44.160
and I know you guys
come from a tough culture.

01:16:44.366 --> 01:16:46.163
I mean, look at me,
I'm just a Jew from Long Island.

01:16:46.234 --> 01:16:47.394
Not a tough culture.

01:16:48.136 --> 01:16:49.831
I was just blowing off some steam,
you know,

01:16:49.905 --> 01:16:50.997
I had one too many happy drinks.

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:53.331
Don't sweat it, Marty. It's all business.

01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:56.935
We're just going to figure out our next
move and see if you'|| be part of it.

01:16:57.479 --> 01:17:00.175
Well, I hope so. And for what it's worth,
I think we'd be a great fit.

01:17:00.248 --> 01:17:03.308
I know we'd work hard by you guys
and try to do the best we can.

01:17:03.385 --> 01:17:05.853
Yeah, for what it's worth,
I've known this guy since he was a kid.

01:17:05.921 --> 01:17:07.047
He's a good man right here.

01:17:07.122 --> 01:17:09.647
We're gonna switch him to decaf
happy drinks, but he's a good man.

01:17:09.725 --> 01:17:10.817
Cheers.

01:17:10.926 --> 01:17:12.393
And now, Paul couldn't make it, no?

01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:15.390
Well, he might come,
he might not come. I'm not sure yet.

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:17.295
But I'm here. And Mike's here.

01:17:17.733 --> 01:17:19.360
- And you know, so is she.
- And so is she.

01:17:20.202 --> 01:17:21.226
More champagne!

01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:24.937
- My granddaughter is a star.
- Yes, she is.

01:17:25.207 --> 01:17:27.198
Emily, you were amazing.

01:17:27.876 --> 01:17:29.366
Thanks, Grandpa.

01:17:29.911 --> 01:17:32.243
Now don't be such strangers, you two.

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:36.341
I know my son- in- law, Mr. Big Shot
with the work and travel and...

01:17:36.451 --> 01:17:37.475
I got it.

01:17:37.953 --> 01:17:40.353
You got it? Or you get it?

01:17:41.089 --> 01:17:42.386
I get it.

01:17:44.726 --> 01:17:48.253
Babe, here. You take this.

01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:51.289
Go sell your company.

01:17:52.768 --> 01:17:53.962
- Really?
- Go.

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:57.237
Okay, only because you're telling me to.
And duty calls.

01:17:57.305 --> 01:17:59.068
And I will see you guys...

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:02.500
Love you, okay.
Good job, you know, raising her.

01:18:02.944 --> 01:18:05.913
And you, you're my life.
You know that, right?

01:18:05.981 --> 01:18:07.915
- And you were amazing, you know that.
- Love you, Dad.

01:18:07.983 --> 01:18:09.575
And I take full credit for all your talent.

01:18:09.651 --> 01:18:11.881
- You know that as well. Bye. Okay.
- I love you so much.

01:18:13.221 --> 01:18:15.382
Great! You gotta kind of...

01:18:15.457 --> 01:18:17.288
Even though...

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:19.884
- But still, there's a whole...
- I know. I know.

01:18:25.634 --> 01:18:26.623
Hey- 

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.203
Clarissa? Can I...

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:39.579
Hi. Can I ask you a quick question?

01:18:40.682 --> 01:18:43.651
Is there any reason
why you brought this asshole down here

01:18:43.719 --> 01:18:45.346
when you knew
how important this meeting was?

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:49.652
Why would you call him an asshole
and who is this important meeting for?

01:18:50.459 --> 01:18:51.483
My friends.

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:55.721
Well, maybe you need to start
doing things for yourself

01:18:55.797 --> 01:18:57.788
and not your friends as much.

01:18:57.866 --> 01:19:00.460
Don't you think your life
and your business could use a little help?

01:19:00.836 --> 01:19:02.531
Where is this coming from?
What are you talking about?

01:19:02.604 --> 01:19:05.198
I simply called you,
asked you to come down by yourself,

01:19:05.273 --> 01:19:06.934
maybe bring a couple of girls, you know,

01:19:07.008 --> 01:19:09.203
I wanted to have
an impressive night for my boys.

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:13.714
Yeah, don't worry, your image of Cool Mike
will not be tarnished.

01:19:13.782 --> 01:19:16.080
You're still the player
that everyone needs to live through.

01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:21.689
Well, Clarissa, maybe,
maybe I don't want to be that guy anymore.

01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:24.453
Really?

01:19:24.526 --> 01:19:27.222
Because I came by to say hi the other day,

01:19:27.295 --> 01:19:30.822
and that same girl was leaving
in the middle of the day!

01:19:31.633 --> 01:19:32.964
What, Lexi?

01:19:33.835 --> 01:19:35.234
She was just returning my jersey!

01:19:36.671 --> 01:19:37.933
Is that what you call it?

01:19:38.373 --> 01:19:40.273
Because you have a name for everything.

01:19:40.342 --> 01:19:43.607
What is that, "The Jersey Return"?
Is that what it's called?

01:19:43.678 --> 01:19:44.667
You got a problem?

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:48.114
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
I do have a problem.

01:19:48.416 --> 01:19:50.441
Yeah, obviously, I see you waving at me
like some kind of pansy.

01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:51.811
- Get the fuck outta my face.
- All right.

01:19:51.887 --> 01:19:55.846
Look, I'm done! I'm outta here.
Goodbye. Go fuck yourselves.

01:19:57.993 --> 01:19:59.585
Good one, Don Juan!

01:19:59.661 --> 01:20:01.686
Real romantic, Casanova.

01:20:01.763 --> 01:20:02.752
Fuck off!

01:20:21.316 --> 01:20:23.341
Go make yourself a drink.

01:20:29.624 --> 01:20:31.524
Excuse me? Young lady, excuse me?

01:20:31.726 --> 01:20:33.523
- That's our drink.
- Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

01:20:33.595 --> 01:20:35.495
- It's cool, right?
- No, actually, it's not cool.

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:37.395
This is our table, and this is our alcohol,

01:20:37.465 --> 01:20:39.330
so if you'd like to have a drink,

01:20:39.401 --> 01:20:41.164
maybe she should go to the bar, right?

01:20:41.636 --> 01:20:43.433
Okay? Thanks. Got it?

01:20:43.905 --> 01:20:44.963
I don't really think I got it.

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:46.898
Come here, let me explain it to you.

01:20:46.975 --> 01:20:49.341
See, this is our table, right?

01:20:49.477 --> 01:20:50.910
And we paid a lot of money for it,

01:20:50.979 --> 01:20:52.674
so if you want a drink
or your friends want a drink,

01:20:52.747 --> 01:20:53.736
have them go to the bar.

01:20:53.815 --> 01:20:54.873
It's just a drink, dog.

01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:58.044
No, it's not just a drink.
It's our drinks, right?

01:20:58.119 --> 01:20:59.814
And that's our table that we paid for.

01:20:59.888 --> 01:21:02.914
So, if you and your guest want alcohol,
go to the fucking bar.

01:21:04.025 --> 01:21:05.014
That is weak, chief.

01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:07.594
- Excuse me?
- Relax, captain.

01:21:07.662 --> 01:21:10.130
All right, you know what, if you call me
one more name that isn't mine,

01:21:10.198 --> 01:21:12.029
- I'm gonna fuck you up.
- You're gonna fuck me up?

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:13.089
Yeah.

01:21:14.636 --> 01:21:16.263
This fucking guy, huh?

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:19.998
What's going on?

01:21:20.675 --> 01:21:21.733
What's up?

01:21:22.844 --> 01:21:24.277
Hell. guys. Miss me?

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:26.146
- Paul, you made it!
- Yeah.

01:21:26.481 --> 01:21:28.278
Looks like you got
all your girlfriends now, huh?

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:30.780
You know what,
you called me a lot of names today,

01:21:30.852 --> 01:21:32.251
but there's one that you forgot.

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:33.412
- What's that?
- It's...

01:21:59.681 --> 01:22:01.205
I'm sorry, guys.

01:22:02.517 --> 01:22:04.542
- They didn't say anything?
- No, they didn't say anything.

01:22:04.619 --> 01:22:07.019
- They just walked out?
- They just walked out.

01:22:09.024 --> 01:22:10.616
Fuck.

01:22:59.307 --> 01:23:00.365
Hello.

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:03.035
Hi.

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:04.904
ok3Y- 

01:23:05.947 --> 01:23:07.005
Wow.

01:23:10.318 --> 01:23:12.411
You think you could pay attention to this?

01:23:13.188 --> 01:23:15.315
I think for the rest of my life, yeah.

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:19.984
I love you.

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:23.630
I love you, too.

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:27.400
You're my fantasy.

01:23:27.469 --> 01:23:30.165
Did I tell you that? No?

01:23:39.581 --> 01:23:40.775
ok3Y- 

01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:42.077
- Babe?
- Yeah?

01:23:42.150 --> 01:23:44.448
You just did something to your back,
didn't you?

01:23:44.519 --> 01:23:45.816
I've done a little something. Yes.

01:23:45.887 --> 01:23:49.254
There is some Aleve right here
in this drawer next to me.

01:23:49.324 --> 01:23:50.814
Really?

01:23:50.892 --> 01:23:52.018
- Do you want me to...
- No.

01:23:52.093 --> 01:23:54.493
I'll get it as soon as
I can make a full rotation.

01:23:54.562 --> 01:23:56.462
In the mean time,
I think I'm just going to kiss you.

01:23:56.531 --> 01:23:57.964
In this position.

01:24:10.311 --> 01:24:11.369
Hey- 

01:24:11.913 --> 01:24:12.937
Listen, I'm sorry.

01:24:13.248 --> 01:24:15.352
It's too late. I just came to
get my check and that's that.

01:24:15.365 --> 01:24:17.480
We don't need
to discuss it.

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:18.712
Clarissa, listen to me, hear me out.

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:22.180
- I completely...
- Mike, stop!

01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:23.281
Trust me, this is for the best.

01:24:23.358 --> 01:24:26.350
We can't work together and have this
tension and pretend that we don't...

01:24:28.396 --> 01:24:30.489
It's too much. I'm sorry.

01:24:30.565 --> 01:24:31.862
I admit it, Clarissa. I admit it.

01:24:31.933 --> 01:24:33.924
I was immature, what I did at the club.
It was stupid.

01:24:34.002 --> 01:24:36.527
You're in your 40s.
Who still fights in their 40s?

01:24:36.938 --> 01:24:38.405
Well, George Foreman made a comeback.

01:24:38.473 --> 01:24:40.873
It's not a joke to me! It's not. Okay?

01:24:41.576 --> 01:24:44.511
I'm outta here.
And good luck with this place.

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:48.144
I hope you save it.
A lot of people will miss it if you don't.

01:25:00.261 --> 01:25:02.286
Hey, what's up? What's the emergency?

01:25:03.832 --> 01:25:06.767
- You ruined the deal, Mike.
- You fucked us good, Mike.

01:25:06.835 --> 01:25:08.735
- I mean you fucked up!
- Fuck.

01:25:08.803 --> 01:25:10.862
Damn, I'm sorry. You know what,
I knew I shouldn't have taken...

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:11.928
Mike, we're kidding.

01:25:12.674 --> 01:25:15.006
The Australians called this morning.
The deal's done.

01:25:15.076 --> 01:25:16.134
We closed the deal!

01:25:16.244 --> 01:25:19.270
Your two best friends
just sold their company for real money!

01:25:19.347 --> 01:25:20.678
Fuck, yeah!

01:25:22.217 --> 01:25:24.378
I told you the Australians like
that rough- and- tumble stuff.

01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:25.976
And I told you they were maniacs.

01:25:28.156 --> 01:25:29.783
You wanna give it to him, or should I?

01:25:29.858 --> 01:25:31.189
You do it.

01:25:31.392 --> 01:25:33.223
No, let me do it. No, you do it.

01:25:33.294 --> 01:25:34.318
What?

01:25:35.230 --> 01:25:36.595
Hey, Mike...

01:25:37.499 --> 01:25:38.864
Thank you, for real.

01:25:43.271 --> 01:25:44.295
What is this, hush money?

01:25:44.839 --> 01:25:46.067
No.

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:49.338
That's "We're fine,
now go take care of your own life" money.

01:25:49.978 --> 01:25:51.172
Seriously, Mike, we're good.

01:25:51.646 --> 01:25:54.308
Go take your own advice.
Everything's great at home with us.

01:25:54.415 --> 01:25:56.315
Lianne's cuddling me so much,

01:25:56.384 --> 01:25:58.249
I pulled my shoulder
out of the socket the other night.

01:25:58.319 --> 01:25:59.479
- Guys, I can't take your money.
- Mike.

01:25:59.554 --> 01:26:00.646
- I'm all right. I'm all right.
- Mike.

01:26:00.922 --> 01:26:03.186
Go handle your business. Seriously.

01:26:04.359 --> 01:26:05.758
Thank you. gulls- 

01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:07.421
Thank you.

01:26:14.269 --> 01:26:16.066
Sometimes immaturity can work for you.

01:26:16.137 --> 01:26:19.038
Goldbam co- founders incite a riot in a club

01:26:19.107 --> 01:26:22.599
and the result is
the biggest sale in marketing history.

01:26:23.244 --> 01:26:25.838
I'm gonna buy, like, that section.

01:26:25.914 --> 01:26:28.883
All right, that's cool.
I'm going to buy Tribeca and the Knicks.

01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:31.544
Okay, that sounds good.
I'll take Soho and the Giants.

01:26:31.619 --> 01:26:33.985
Fuck it. I'm gonna buy
the Bronx Zoo and free the monkeys.

01:26:34.055 --> 01:26:36.990
Hey, that's good. Yeah, man.

01:26:37.058 --> 01:26:38.719
- What am I gonna do?
- What are you gonna do, man?

01:26:38.793 --> 01:26:41.261
I'm gonna have an eagle, and an entourage.

01:26:41.329 --> 01:26:43.058
That's cool. I'm gonna have a helicopter.

01:26:43.131 --> 01:26:44.928
- Yeah?
- And I'm gonna just fly into the city.

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:47.001
And I'm just gonna, like,
land on Sixth Avenue.

01:26:47.068 --> 01:26:48.228
Fuck it. Every day.

01:26:48.303 --> 01:26:50.100
Give me your helicopter phone number.

01:26:50.171 --> 01:26:51.832
And I'm gonna buy
Derek Jeter's phone book.

01:26:51.906 --> 01:26:53.737
I might start wearing a cape.

01:26:54.209 --> 01:26:55.733
- Fuck it. Why not?
- Yeah.

01:26:56.477 --> 01:26:59.469
Hi, Clarissa, it's me, Mike. And...

01:27:00.181 --> 01:27:02.115
I'll try to make this brief because...

01:27:02.183 --> 01:27:04.447
I'm not really good
at this type of thing, but...

01:27:07.522 --> 01:27:09.922
Well, Clarissa you blindsided me.
And it's all your fault.

01:27:10.425 --> 01:27:12.450
Shit, that didn't come out right.

01:27:12.527 --> 01:27:15.291
I think what I mean to say is that...

01:27:15.363 --> 01:27:19.459
That I have feelings for you,
and it's pissing me off.

01:27:20.501 --> 01:27:22.992
Sorry, that's... That's not right either.

01:27:23.071 --> 01:27:25.266
I think... I just...

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:29.168
I've never felt this before. And...

01:27:30.678 --> 01:27:34.114
I don't know how to react.
I don't know what to do.

01:27:34.182 --> 01:27:37.447
I think what I'm trying to say is that I
haven't had these feelings in a long time,

01:27:37.518 --> 01:27:40.715
and I'm trying to make sense out of it.

01:27:40.788 --> 01:27:42.756
But it's sort of throwing my game off.

01:27:42.824 --> 01:27:44.985
You know, I mean,
not that I'm playing games, because

01:27:45.059 --> 01:27:48.426
that would be like, fuck, I mean, shit...
I mean, fuck, sorry,

01:27:48.496 --> 01:27:51.829
I shouldn't cuss on your thing. But...

01:27:53.334 --> 01:27:55.700
All right, I guess,
what I am trying to say is that...

01:27:55.770 --> 01:27:58.000
Listen, we're having this party,

01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:02.907
celebration at the bar tonight
and things are going really well,

01:28:02.977 --> 01:28:04.376
and it's sort of like a grand re- opening.

01:28:04.445 --> 01:28:05.742
And I would love it if you would come,

01:28:05.813 --> 01:28:07.838
and if you don't come, I totally understand

01:28:07.915 --> 01:28:09.439
but it would be great if you come because

01:28:09.517 --> 01:28:10.870
I think that I'm falling
in love with you...

01:28:10.883 --> 01:28:12.247
Fuck! I mean...

01:28:13.388 --> 01:28:15.913
Shit, fuck, sorry. I...

01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:17.651
This is Mike, bye.

01:28:19.694 --> 01:28:21.423
This is New York City,

01:28:21.496 --> 01:28:23.521
the most populous city
in the United States.

01:28:23.598 --> 01:28:25.657
8.2 million people,

01:28:25.733 --> 01:28:28.566
4. 72 million people of which are married.

01:28:28.636 --> 01:28:31.070
One of which is not me. Why?

01:28:31.606 --> 01:28:33.130
Ask somebody else.

01:28:38.146 --> 01:28:41.047
Well, I'm going to sing a song that

01:28:41.115 --> 01:28:43.379
I loved as a kid by REO Speedwagon, and...

01:28:44.519 --> 01:28:46.248
I guess, sis, this is for you.

01:28:47.522 --> 01:28:49.080
And for you, Lianne.

01:28:50.391 --> 01:28:51.653
And all my friends out there.

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:54.421
And a little bit for myself.

01:29:17.518 --> 01:29:18.951
Can I just say something first, if! may?

01:29:21.689 --> 01:29:24.852
A few days ago we all went to a comedy club

01:29:24.992 --> 01:29:28.860
and this comic said something that...
It was so simple and so perfect,

01:29:28.930 --> 01:29:31.728
but I haven't been able to forget it.

01:29:32.734 --> 01:29:34.565
He said, "Love the flaws.''

01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:37.931
Just love the flaws.

01:29:40.007 --> 01:29:42.271
And if you're lucky enough to find love,

01:29:42.410 --> 01:29:44.401
and you know when it hits you, because

01:29:45.313 --> 01:29:46.678
it knocks you on your ass,

01:29:49.083 --> 01:29:50.277
you have to respect it.

01:29:50.985 --> 01:29:52.714
You have to cherish it.

01:29:53.621 --> 01:29:56.215
And you have to fight for it.
Fight through it.

01:29:57.859 --> 01:29:59.588
And maybe even have a
little fun on the ride.

01:30:02.663 --> 01:30:04.255
I think that's what I learned.

01:30:05.199 --> 01:30:06.666
I hope it's not too late.

01:30:10.505 --> 01:30:14.635
So you figured that you've got it
All figured out

01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:21.280
He's a sweet- talking stud
who can melt a girl's heart with his pout

01:30:21.649 --> 01:30:22.809
All right, Mike.

01:30:22.884 --> 01:30:26.615
He's the kind of lover
that the ladies dream about

01:30:26.687 --> 01:30:29.247
Oh, yes, he is

01:30:29.323 --> 01:30:34.317
He's got plenty of cash
He's got plenty of friends

01:30:34.395 --> 01:30:41.198
He drives women wild
And he drives off in a Mercedes- Benz

01:30:41.269 --> 01:30:47.174
He's got a long wick
With a flame at both ends

01:30:47.241 --> 01:30:51.940
But don't let him go

01:30:52.013 --> 01:30:56.609
Just give him a chance to grow

01:30:56.684 --> 01:31:01.519
Take it easy, take it slow
But don't let him go

01:31:01.589 --> 01:31:03.523
Don't let him go

01:31:08.963 --> 01:31:11.022
Don't let him go

01:31:13.668 --> 01:31:16.466
Don't let him go

01:31:18.406 --> 01:31:20.237
Don't let him go

01:31:24.078 --> 01:31:25.875
Shares of marriage went up this week

01:31:25.947 --> 01:31:28.507
as couples everywhere
learned that loving the flaws

01:31:28.583 --> 01:31:30.483
may be the answer they
were all looking for.

01:32:19.367 --> 01:32:22.427
Fortunately for you,
there is only three, three paths.

01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:24.597
Hers, yours.

01:32:25.439 --> 01:32:27.304
and yours and hers together.

01:32:27.675 --> 01:32:30.075
See? There, there it is!
I've been path- fucked!

01:32:30.978 --> 01:32:33.173
What kind of thing is that to say out loud?

01:32:33.614 --> 01:32:34.774
Sorry.
