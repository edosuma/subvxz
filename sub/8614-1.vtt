00:28.111 --> 00:32.488
Long ago, the duke of Milan
commissioned a little-known artist...

00:32.656 --> 00:36.368
to erect a mammoth statue
of a horse.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.914
The time was 1481.

00:41.082 --> 00:44.668
The artist was Leonardo da Vinci.

00:44.836 --> 00:48.297
The guy on the donkey
is just a guy on a donkey.

00:48.465 --> 00:53.052
Anyway, they called this statue
the Sforza...

00:53.219 --> 00:58.390
and it was gonna be
the largest bronze statue ever built.

00:58.558 --> 00:59.975
But wouldn't you know it...

01:00.143 --> 01:04.188
war broke out,
and bronze became scarce.

01:04.355 --> 01:07.441
So da Vinci decided
to create a machine...

01:07.609 --> 01:11.236
to change common lead
into bronze.

01:11.905 --> 01:15.491
But when da Vinci
finally turned this machine on...

01:15.658 --> 01:19.953
it was to give him something
more than he expected.

01:22.290 --> 01:25.292
Something much more than bronze.

01:25.460 --> 01:29.505
Leonardo, che pazzo!

03:41.095 --> 03:44.181
- Gold.
- Gold.

06:09.952 --> 06:12.829
Exactly 500 years later...

06:12.997 --> 06:15.916
an artiste of a different field...

06:16.084 --> 06:19.044
The one of cat burglary.

06:19.212 --> 06:23.256
Was getting out of Sing Sing.

06:23.424 --> 06:26.468
He was known
as the Hudson Hawk.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.889
Got a coat, hat.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.849
Here's your personal items.

06:33.017 --> 06:34.851
Here's your wallet.

06:35.019 --> 06:37.229
I think you'll find
everything in there.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.189
Don't you want your receipt?

06:39.357 --> 06:40.982
Keep it. Ready?

06:41.150 --> 06:42.901
I got it, Charlie.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.112
Eddie. Eddie.

06:45.279 --> 06:47.656
So the Hudson Hawk is
finally getting out.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.242
Remember all the reporters
that here when you came in?

06:50.410 --> 06:52.119
"World's greatest cat burglar."

06:52.286 --> 06:54.162
Now who gives a fuck?

06:54.330 --> 06:55.580
I got a proposition for you.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.457
Answer's no, Gates.
Even if you bathe.

06:57.625 --> 07:00.460
Listen, smartass, as your
parole officer, I found you a job.

07:00.628 --> 07:04.172
- No way.
- It's a terrific job. An auction house.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.091
One night's work, and you're free.

07:06.259 --> 07:09.428
No checking in with a shrink.
No more community service.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.596
But I want to do
community service.

07:11.764 --> 07:14.099
I want to teach the handicapped
how to yodel.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.935
I ain't stealing no more, Gates.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.563
Ten years later, you're still
impressed with yourself.

07:19.730 --> 07:23.108
Same old coat, same old hat.
You're extinct, Hawk.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.360
Coming from you,
that's a powerful statement.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.404
Look, aren't you supposed to stop me
from committing crimes.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.407
You know, "Book 'em, Danno."
"Give a hoot, don't pollute."

07:30.575 --> 07:32.784
You ain't out yet, wise guy.

07:32.952 --> 07:36.455
I can set you up and send you back
any time I want.

07:36.622 --> 07:42.836
It's a very fine line
between ex-con and escaped con.

07:43.004 --> 07:46.089
Hey, Gates, do it yourself.

07:46.632 --> 07:49.176
Hey! He's got my keys!

07:49.343 --> 07:50.719
I'll be seeing you, Hawk!

07:57.518 --> 07:59.269
Open the gate!

08:04.692 --> 08:07.360
- See you around, Mike.
- Take it easy, Eddie.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.878
That's the first thing I did:

08:25.046 --> 08:27.964
Smooch the ground
and taste the freedom.

08:28.132 --> 08:30.133
Sorry I'm late, Eddie.
I miss anything?

08:30.301 --> 08:32.928
As always,
your timing is impeccable.

08:36.807 --> 08:38.683
- Where's the kiss?
- Get away from me.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.936
No tongue this time, I promise.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.607
What?

08:45.775 --> 08:48.818
- Looks like you been expanding your...
- Don't say it, Eddie!

08:48.986 --> 08:51.363
I'm incredibly sensitive
about my fucking figure.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.991
My next word was gonna be
"consciousness"...

08:55.159 --> 08:56.618
tubbo.

08:59.247 --> 09:01.373
You're free, you son of a bitch!

09:05.545 --> 09:07.837
Now that you're born again,
what do you wanna do?

09:08.005 --> 09:10.298
Statue of Liberty?
Entertain some ladies?

09:10.466 --> 09:12.342
Broadway tix?
Seduce some women?

09:12.510 --> 09:15.470
Play Nintendo?
Bone some chicks?

09:17.723 --> 09:19.641
What's Nintendo?

09:19.809 --> 09:21.851
Just get me to
the Five Tone, Tommy.

09:22.019 --> 09:24.354
I don't get a cappuccino soon,
I'll strangle somebody.

09:24.522 --> 09:27.566
You still got a thing for those
unmasculine European coffees?

09:27.733 --> 09:31.194
- What can I say?
- Who's your buddy?

09:31.362 --> 09:35.365
The man knows! The man knows!

09:35.533 --> 09:38.201
So, Mr. Coffee, you have
any trouble checking out?

09:38.369 --> 09:39.411
Not much.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.872
Gates just tried to blackmail me
into doing a job.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.125
That doughnut-hole-eating,
son of a bitch...

09:45.293 --> 09:48.753
take-it-in-the-ear-for-a-beer
rat bastard!

09:48.921 --> 09:50.714
Had the perfect amount of foam.

09:50.881 --> 09:53.508
Come on, I'll get you 10 of them
back at the bar.

09:53.676 --> 09:56.094
An auction house? Gates wants you
to rob an auction house?

09:56.262 --> 09:57.721
Yes, an auction house.
What are you, going deaf?

09:57.888 --> 10:01.433
He's your parole officer, for Christ's sake.
And, look, I am not going deaf.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.643
Tommy, just get me
in the Five Tone.

10:03.811 --> 10:05.186
Yeah, all right.

10:05.354 --> 10:07.731
"Going deaf."
Don't make fun of my hearing, right?

10:07.898 --> 10:10.692
Tell you something about the bar.
You're gonna love it.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.902
Five Tone Bar and Grill.

10:13.070 --> 10:17.073
At least I know there's one thing
that will never cha...

10:17.241 --> 10:18.842
I don't know how
to tell you this, Eddie.

10:18.909 --> 10:21.536
Couple of brokers stopped in
for Stoli spritzers one night.

10:21.704 --> 10:25.498
Now we're a nice local bar
that none of the locals can afford.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.251
I read about these people
in Newsweek.

10:28.419 --> 10:29.961
Where's all the regulars?

10:30.129 --> 10:32.339
- Where's Crazy Jeff Cava?
- Gone.

10:32.506 --> 10:34.799
- Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?
- Gone, Eddie.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.302
Tommy, you took down
Captain Bob's steering wheel?

10:37.470 --> 10:39.721
Eddie, Eddie, they're all gone.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.806
But look at the bright side:

10:41.974 --> 10:44.225
Half this joint is yours.

10:44.393 --> 10:47.395
Hey, Blackjack! Give my
irritable partner a cappuccino.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.064
I gotta go be a boss.

10:49.231 --> 10:51.024
Give me a Scotch and water.
Thanks.

10:51.192 --> 10:56.363
- Reindeer goat cheese pizza?!
- Yo!

10:56.530 --> 10:59.115
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.682
Cute shot, Antony.

11:23.849 --> 11:26.559
Cesar Mario. Antony Mario.

11:26.727 --> 11:28.353
I didn't know the circus
was in town.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.897
So why won't you do
the auction house?

11:31.065 --> 11:33.358
Well, call me superstitious, Cesar.

11:33.526 --> 11:37.195
I don't like to commit a crime within
24 hours of getting out of the joint.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.323
It's very simple.
There's a safe on the seventh floor.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.951
You take their thingy
and you put it in this thingy.

11:43.119 --> 11:44.953
Directions even your brother
could understand.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.996
Yeah, directions
even I could understand.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.748
Shut up.

11:48.916 --> 11:50.792
Hawk, you're the best.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.920
You're the only one who can
do this job. You know that.

11:54.088 --> 11:56.423
Don't tell me a lot of horse shit,
you wanna open up a hardware store...

11:56.590 --> 11:58.717
go straight and sell spatulas.

11:58.884 --> 12:02.804
You know Cesar, if the Mario brothers weren't
New Jersey's third-largest crime family...

12:02.972 --> 12:04.764
I'd say kiss my ass.

12:04.932 --> 12:08.059
But considering your status,
I will say slurp my butt.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.269
- Sit.
- Sit.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.396
Have you lovely ladies
tried our house wine?

12:11.564 --> 12:13.606
- I think you'll enjoy.
- Beat it, Tommy.

12:13.774 --> 12:15.525
No dinosaurs allowed.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.694
Enough!

12:20.740 --> 12:24.451
You don't do that auction house job,
I'm gonna put you on trial...

12:24.618 --> 12:26.202
and I promise you, my friend...

12:26.370 --> 12:28.121
there will be no bailiff.

12:28.289 --> 12:30.623
You understand?

12:30.791 --> 12:32.167
Get him out of here.

12:49.935 --> 12:52.479
- "Witchcraft."
- Three minutes, 57 seconds.

12:52.646 --> 12:55.315
- "Night and Day"?
- Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald?

12:55.483 --> 12:58.026
- Sinatra.
- Five minutes, 12 seconds.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.652
"Hit the Road, Jack."

12:59.820 --> 13:01.863
Tommy, where are my
needle-nose pliers?

13:02.031 --> 13:04.616
Check the bar. "Hit the Road, Jack."

13:04.784 --> 13:08.870
Five minutes, 15 seconds.

13:09.038 --> 13:12.916
How the hell could you take this down, man?
Captain Bob's steering wheel?

13:13.083 --> 13:15.210
Don't you remember the night he came in? Nobody
could figure out where he got this thing.

13:15.377 --> 13:17.086
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

13:17.254 --> 13:20.048
- Yes?
- Quiet. Come here.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.426
We got a nasty little safe
on the seventh floor here.

13:23.594 --> 13:25.595
- Simpson?
- Yeah.

13:25.763 --> 13:28.515
- What's the mechanism?
- Seventy-one.

13:28.682 --> 13:31.017
Last time I went to bat,
Simpson only made a 40.

13:31.185 --> 13:34.187
So it's gonna take you another
extra 31 seconds to seduce it.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.356
- I'm not worried about the safe, Tommy.
- I know you're not worried about it.

13:36.524 --> 13:37.649
What about these guards?
We know any of these guys?

13:37.817 --> 13:38.858
No.

13:39.026 --> 13:40.109
- Not one?
- Not one. No.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.862
- Well, what about the video surveillance?
- I have a plan.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.948
- Oh, you got a plan.
- I have a great plan.

13:45.115 --> 13:45.615
Great.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.746
What the hell am I doing?

13:51.914 --> 13:55.124
What the hell am I doing?
I'm getting ready to do some crime.

13:55.292 --> 13:56.653
Go rob some fakakta horse
with you?

13:56.710 --> 13:57.836
All right, Eddie...

13:58.003 --> 13:59.671
I should be out there
getting myself a Daily News,

13:59.839 --> 14:02.319
looking in the "Want Ads"
trying to get a job selling spatulas.

14:02.466 --> 14:03.883
We're moving too fast, Eddie.

14:04.051 --> 14:07.846
You see, I'm putting out a fire
with kerosene.

14:08.013 --> 14:11.432
- What is that?
- That's five seconds. My record's 18.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.642
Is this funny?

14:12.810 --> 14:15.854
You think this is
some kind of fucking joke?

14:32.079 --> 14:35.164
- How many seconds?
- How many what seconds?

14:35.332 --> 14:36.708
On the thumbcuffs.

14:36.876 --> 14:41.004
Not counting the bitching and whining,
I'll be nice and say eight.

14:41.171 --> 14:45.758
You know, they're not gonna let you
walk away from this job, kiddo.

14:45.926 --> 14:49.262
I ain't never gonna get
rehabilitated this way, Tommy.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.097
You think you still got it, Eddie?

14:51.265 --> 14:53.474
Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of.

14:54.643 --> 14:56.978
- "Mack the Knife"?
- Four minutes, 17 seconds.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.813
"I Only Have Eyes for You."

14:58.981 --> 15:00.648
Why, Tommy,
I didn't know you cared.

15:00.816 --> 15:02.108
Three minutes, 22 seconds.

15:02.276 --> 15:04.068
- "Xanadu."
- "Xanadu"?

15:04.236 --> 15:06.696
- "Xanadu."
- Four minutes, 19 seconds.

15:06.864 --> 15:09.824
"Star-spangled Banner."
Whitney Houston, Super Bowl XVI I.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.618
- Hi.
- Hi, Hank.

15:11.785 --> 15:14.913
- Seven minutes, 17 seconds.
- You're full of shit.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.441
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

15:16.582 --> 15:18.462
How come I'm not out
trying to get laid tonight?

15:18.584 --> 15:20.126
Eddie, you're bumming my high.

15:20.294 --> 15:21.794
Come on. It's show time.

15:23.505 --> 15:25.256
Tommy, hold on. Hold on a minute.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.467
The sign here says
"no horseplay in the pool area."

15:27.635 --> 15:28.927
This isn't horseplay.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.429
This is a major felony.

16:02.169 --> 16:07.674
Come on, Grandpa.

16:07.841 --> 16:09.634
- Hey, Tommy.
- What?

16:09.802 --> 16:11.469
Give me one good reason
why we're up here.

16:11.637 --> 16:15.223
I can give you two:
Antony Mario and Cesar Mario.

16:15.391 --> 16:16.683
Well, you don't really think
that they're gonna...

16:16.850 --> 16:18.851
Cut off our balls
if we don't do the job.

16:19.019 --> 16:20.395
I see.

16:20.562 --> 16:21.688
- Let me ask you something else.
- What?!

16:21.855 --> 16:22.981
- Did you have dinner tonight?
- Why?

16:23.148 --> 16:25.274
Because this rope only holds
900 pounds.

16:25.442 --> 16:27.902
- Eddie, stop fooling around!
- I'm not fooling around.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.113
You are! You're fooling around!

16:30.280 --> 16:33.241
- Pick me up. Pick me up.
- All right, all right.

16:33.409 --> 16:35.535
- Come on.
- I wish you'd lay off the pasta.

16:42.626 --> 16:46.295
What are you doing?
What are you doing?!

16:46.463 --> 16:49.007
Covering our tracks.
We leave through the basement.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.175
Well, now we have
no choice, do we?

17:02.187 --> 17:04.564
- What?
- I better make the hole a little bigger.

17:04.732 --> 17:07.525
Don't worry, bonehead.
I'm wearing my girdle.

17:36.680 --> 17:40.808
Six hundred and seventy-three Wongs
in the phone book.

17:40.976 --> 17:43.227
That's a hell of a lot of "Wong" numbers.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.396
Look up "Chin."

18:01.121 --> 18:02.330
That's it.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.332
- You got a key?
- No.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.042
Just checking.

18:26.897 --> 18:29.065
They record everything
video surveillance takes in.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.317
Yes, I can see that, master thief.

18:31.485 --> 18:32.652
I thought you
said something about a plan.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.738
Oh, am I boring you, smartass?

18:35.906 --> 18:38.407
Hey, Jerry, check out Big Stan.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.288
Watch this.

18:48.544 --> 18:49.710
Big Stan!

18:53.799 --> 18:55.925
Now watch.
A little rewind and replay...

18:56.093 --> 18:58.053
and the guards are gonna be
watching a rerun...

18:58.137 --> 19:00.805
and they're gonna miss out
on tonight's exciting episode.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.682
- You figure this out by yourself?
- Yeah.

19:02.850 --> 19:03.933
Good plan, junior.

19:04.101 --> 19:07.812
We got about five minutes
and change.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.939
Five thirty-two,
"Swinging on a Star."

19:10.107 --> 19:12.859
You know the invented something
while you were inside. It's called a watch.

19:13.026 --> 19:14.277
- Hey, Tommy.
- What?

19:18.907 --> 19:20.616

19:20.784 --> 19:21.993

- You got the horse, Ed?
- I just got out of jail yesterday...

21:28.620 --> 21:31.998
- and I'm robbing an auction house.
- Let's go, Hawk.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.876
Hey, Dean, I don't get it.

21:36.044 --> 21:38.045
I'm looking at the auction room,
and I see that little blue chair.

21:38.213 --> 21:41.048
I didn't wanna do it.
All I wanted was a cappuccino.

21:41.216 --> 21:42.258
Snap out of it!

21:42.426 --> 21:45.261
You think that's strange,
check out screen two.

21:45.429 --> 21:46.846
Hey, that's us.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.764
- Somebody rewired the recorders.
- Shit!

21:48.932 --> 21:50.132
I hold you responsible, Tommy.

21:50.225 --> 21:52.977
♪ You could be swinging on a star ♪
Let's take it home.

21:53.145 --> 21:59.358

swinging on a star ♪ ♪

22:03.655 --> 22:05.072
Hey!

22:13.915 --> 22:17.209
- Let's go out the back way.
- Keep those ideas coming.

22:17.377 --> 22:19.253
Get up. You're embarrassing me.

22:22.799 --> 22:24.675
- Would you get going!
- Come on, go!

22:26.428 --> 22:29.221
- Go, go, go.
- Easy with that.

22:29.389 --> 22:33.392
Come on! Beat it, Tommy!
Come on!

22:33.560 --> 22:36.645
I can't tell you how happy I am
that we covered our tracks.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.525
- Can I ask a question?
- What?

22:41.693 --> 22:43.486
I'm not as fat as that guard, am I?

22:43.653 --> 22:46.947
Oh, no. You're a slender reed
compared to that guard.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.577
Come on, Slim Jim.

23:03.423 --> 23:05.883
Hudson Hawk gets
the chair of honor.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.469
Good job. Not pretty, but good.

23:08.637 --> 23:12.348
All this trouble for a horsey.

23:12.516 --> 23:16.769
I may not know art,
but I know what I like.

23:16.937 --> 23:18.562
- You certainly do.
- So...

23:18.730 --> 23:23.442
when's this Sebastian Cabot Buckingham Palace-looking,
butler-head motherfucker getting here?

23:23.610 --> 23:26.654
Any minute now, dear Mr. Gates.

23:32.369 --> 23:35.329
- Sorry, Jeeves.
- May I?

23:38.542 --> 23:40.000
Exquisite.

23:40.168 --> 23:45.297
Leonardo da Vinci's last commission
for the duke of Milan.

23:45.465 --> 23:47.133
Irreplaceable.

23:47.300 --> 23:50.845
Hey, Mr. French. I'm...

23:51.012 --> 23:52.847
What the...? What.?

23:53.223 --> 23:56.600
Yes...

23:56.768 --> 23:57.852
You son of a bitch.

23:58.019 --> 24:01.439
I stuck my neck out setting this up
for you limey bastards.

24:01.606 --> 24:03.816
Now, where's my cut?

24:12.534 --> 24:14.869
So much for his cut.

24:15.871 --> 24:18.038
Forgive my dry British humor.

24:19.040 --> 24:23.419
You know, I think Gates
promised Hawk a cut too.

24:31.011 --> 24:33.220
Lovely work, Alfred.
You taking the Concorde back?

24:33.388 --> 24:35.431
Always, Mr. Mario.

24:35.599 --> 24:41.729
I'm really racking up
those frequent-flier points.

24:41.897 --> 24:44.815
Ta-ta, Hudson Hawk.

24:47.110 --> 24:48.736
Yo, Five-Tone.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.779
Did I miss anything?

24:50.947 --> 24:54.408
Gates tries to blackmail me.
You ask me, "Did I miss anything?"

24:54.576 --> 24:55.743
Gates gets killed.

24:55.911 --> 24:57.745
You say, "Did I miss anything?"

24:57.913 --> 24:59.330
I bet you'd go up to
Mrs. Lincoln at the Ford Theatre:

24:59.498 --> 25:02.583
And say, "How was the show?
Did I miss anything?"

25:08.089 --> 25:11.050
- You may wanna get this looked at.
- Jeez, Gates was killed?

25:11.218 --> 25:12.927
So who do we send
a thank-you note to?

25:13.094 --> 25:14.220
The butler did it.

25:14.387 --> 25:17.056
Guy was a cross between
Alistair Cooke and a Cuisinart.

25:17.224 --> 25:20.392
Took Mr. Ed, Humpty-Dumptied it
over Gates' head, and get this:

25:20.560 --> 25:24.647
- He said it was made by Leonardo...
- Da Vinci's Sforza.

25:24.814 --> 25:26.094
I consider it to be the prize...

25:26.191 --> 25:30.611
of tonight's auction
of objets d'equestrian.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.363
Horse things.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.949
All right, Mr. PBS, you got me.

25:35.116 --> 25:36.408
Morning edition.

25:36.576 --> 25:39.912
It says here, two thieves
attempted to steal it last night...

25:40.080 --> 25:43.290
but thanks to three brave guards,
it will be ready for tonight.

25:43.458 --> 25:44.875
Attempted?

25:45.043 --> 25:49.296
I didn't wanna steal the goddamned thing in
the first place, but I do have my pride.

25:49.464 --> 25:50.798
I don't understand this.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.591
Why try? Forget about it.

25:52.759 --> 25:55.553
Because I'm tired of not
understanding things. Cops, Mafia...

25:55.720 --> 25:59.160
butlers forcing me to steal something which
now it appears I didn't steal after all.

25:59.182 --> 26:02.851
It's all too goddamn
peculiar, Tommy.

26:03.019 --> 26:04.380
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

26:04.396 --> 26:05.896
How much does a new tuxedo cost?

26:06.064 --> 26:09.733
A fantastic example
of Florentine bronze.

26:09.901 --> 26:14.613
Now, who will start at 140,000?

26:14.781 --> 26:16.490
Hundred-and-forty thousand.

26:16.658 --> 26:18.075
Hundred-and-sixty thousand?

26:18.243 --> 26:21.745
Seventy? Eighty? Ninety thousand.

26:21.913 --> 26:24.164
Two hundred?

26:24.332 --> 26:26.709
Twenty.

26:26.876 --> 26:27.376
Forty.

26:31.590 --> 26:34.592
Two-hundred-and-fifty thousand.

26:34.759 --> 26:38.429
Two-hundred-and-fifty thousand?
Sixty thousand?

26:38.597 --> 26:40.723
Seventy? Eighty?

26:40.890 --> 26:44.643
Ninety? Three hundred thousand.
Three-ten.

26:44.811 --> 26:45.978
Sold.

26:47.022 --> 26:48.063
You know, after all these years...

26:48.231 --> 26:51.233
I still get goose bumps
coming to these auctions.

26:51.401 --> 26:54.820
The paintings, the sculptures...

26:54.988 --> 26:57.364
Things that aren't really
paintings or sculptures.

26:57.532 --> 27:01.243
Pretentious vultures who never look up from
their calculators to see what they're buying.

27:01.411 --> 27:04.288
Now, that gives me goose bumps.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.956
Auctions are disgusting.

27:06.124 --> 27:07.583
I couldn't agree more.

27:07.751 --> 27:09.627
Savages.

27:09.794 --> 27:12.838
Now, lot 15.

27:13.006 --> 27:18.093
An equestrian piece
attributed to the Trillini school.

27:18.261 --> 27:21.764
Now, who will start at 250,000?

27:21.931 --> 27:24.350
Two-hundred-fifty thousand.
Eighty thousand.

27:24.517 --> 27:26.185
Thank you, sir.

27:26.353 --> 27:28.479
Three hundred thousand.
Three-twenty.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.315
Three-forty thousand.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.901
No more on 340,000?

27:34.069 --> 27:37.029
Sold once. Twice.

27:37.197 --> 27:38.906
Sold.

27:39.074 --> 27:43.202
And finally, lot number 17.

27:43.370 --> 27:49.291
Thought to be lost in the war,
and again last night.

27:49.459 --> 27:54.296
The da Vinci Sforza,
the jewel of the sale.

27:54.464 --> 27:55.839
Fantastic.

27:56.007 --> 27:57.841
Is looking like
a constipated warthog...

27:58.009 --> 28:00.678
a prerequisite for getting a job
in the art world?

28:00.845 --> 28:05.391
Doctoressa Anna Baragli
of the Vatican. Doc?

28:05.558 --> 28:08.519
Some of us warthogs are
more constipated than others.

28:26.913 --> 28:29.623
Oh, shit.

28:34.462 --> 28:35.921
Perfection.

28:36.089 --> 28:40.050
The Vatican extends its jealousy
to the lucky bidder.

28:40.218 --> 28:41.844
Thank you, doctor.

28:42.011 --> 28:47.474
We'll begin the bidding
at $20 million. To you, sir.

28:47.642 --> 28:50.811
- Twenty-point-five.
- Waldo!

28:50.979 --> 28:54.314
One hundred million clams.

28:54.482 --> 28:59.194
That's $100 million
to Mr. Darwin Mayflower.

29:01.698 --> 29:07.035
One hundred million and one, Waldo.

29:07.203 --> 29:09.037
Fantastic.

29:09.205 --> 29:12.583
One hundred million dollars
and one.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.168
Outbid by mine own wench.

29:14.335 --> 29:15.586
Quelle bummer.

29:15.754 --> 29:18.964
Don't hate me, baby.

29:21.468 --> 29:23.469
- Bunny.
- Bunny.

29:23.636 --> 29:25.471
Any other bids?

29:25.638 --> 29:27.181
Going once.

29:33.646 --> 29:40.110
Going twice.

29:40.278 --> 29:41.612
Gone.

30:04.761 --> 30:06.678
My God. That was bold of you.

30:06.846 --> 30:08.931
- You didn't have to do that.
- It's nothing.

30:09.098 --> 30:10.618
Anybody would have
done the same thing.

30:10.642 --> 30:13.227
No, I mean, you didn't
have to tackle me and rip my dress.

30:14.813 --> 30:18.482
I'm just kidding.
Thanks for saving me, tough guy.

30:18.650 --> 30:19.942
Why was that guard chasing you?

30:20.109 --> 30:21.735
Because danger, doc,
is my middle...

30:37.794 --> 30:40.587
Couldn't just play along,
could you, Eddie?

30:40.755 --> 30:44.508
You gotta admit, Eddie. Classy way
of covering our tracks?

30:44.676 --> 30:48.595
That auctioneer ought to be landing
at La Guardia any minute now.

30:49.973 --> 30:52.599
Hey, subtlety's not one
of our strong points.

31:03.403 --> 31:05.612
Get the fuck out of here.

31:07.824 --> 31:09.324
You stupid ass!

31:17.834 --> 31:20.127
- Menthol.
- Hey!

31:21.880 --> 31:24.339
This is a brand-new tuxedo!

31:25.758 --> 31:28.260
Hey, mister. Are you gonna die?

31:37.270 --> 31:39.021
Happy sailing, Hawk!

31:39.314 --> 31:40.480
No! Oh, no!

31:40.648 --> 31:41.773
How am I driving?

31:41.941 --> 31:44.401
1-800-I'm-gonna-fucking-die!

31:47.155 --> 31:48.614
Toll booth?!

31:56.956 --> 31:58.248
Exact change?!

32:10.970 --> 32:12.095
Make him roadkill.

32:12.263 --> 32:13.597
Up yours, Cesar.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.682
Yeah, run him down.

32:28.947 --> 32:33.617
Cesar! Antony!

32:33.785 --> 32:35.035
Are you okay?

32:58.434 --> 32:59.874
What the fuck
is the matter with you?

32:59.936 --> 33:02.771
The name's Snickers.
The plane leaves in 40.

33:04.941 --> 33:07.859
Almond Joy. Get it? Candy bars.

33:08.569 --> 33:10.654
Well, it's better
than when we first started out.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.489
Our code names were diseases.

33:12.657 --> 33:15.993
Do you know what it's like
being called Chlamydia for a year?

33:16.786 --> 33:17.953
Oops, forgot.

33:32.343 --> 33:35.095
- My's Butterfinger.
- No shit.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.894
Do you like
the company's new look?

33:43.062 --> 33:45.230
I call them the "MTV-IA."

33:45.398 --> 33:46.523
George, you promised.

33:46.691 --> 33:49.693
No old-CIA/new-CIA jokes.

33:49.861 --> 33:53.780
Punks. They think the Bay of Pigs
is an herbal tea...

33:53.948 --> 33:56.616
and the Cold War has something
to do with penguins.

33:56.784 --> 33:57.993
Don't I know you?

33:58.161 --> 34:01.705
The last time you saw me, I was bald
with a beard and no mustache...

34:01.873 --> 34:03.832
and I had a different nose.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.793
So if you don't recognize me,
I won't be offended.

34:06.961 --> 34:09.170
My high school science teacher?

34:09.672 --> 34:13.091
I'm the guy who tricked you into
robbing the government installation...

34:13.259 --> 34:15.469
and then had you
sent to prison for it.

34:15.636 --> 34:17.429
George Kaplan.

34:21.266 --> 34:23.310
I'm not the type
to hold a grudge, George.

34:24.645 --> 34:26.313
I used you as a diversion.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.732
I guess down deep,
I was just jealous.

34:28.900 --> 34:32.069
You were one hell of a thief.

34:32.235 --> 34:34.946
To what do I owe
the dishonor of this reunion, Georgie?

34:35.114 --> 34:38.199
I wanna make it up to you, kid.
That's why I got you this gig.

34:38.367 --> 34:40.911
And to quote the late, great
Karen Carpenter:

34:41.079 --> 34:42.913
"We have only just begun."

34:43.081 --> 34:45.040
Three minutes, four seconds.

34:45.208 --> 34:46.967
Well you know, George,
you're a little late.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.293
Maybe nobody told you.
I quit stealing.

34:49.462 --> 34:53.005
- My employer wants a meeting.
- Your employer?

34:53.174 --> 34:56.802
- The president?
- No. Somebody powerful.

34:58.054 --> 35:00.889
Good God, what's that?

35:01.057 --> 35:04.851
Now George, you don't expect me
to fall for that old gag, do you?

35:05.019 --> 35:06.561
Shucks, I guess not.

35:07.396 --> 35:10.065
Now?

35:10.233 --> 35:11.900
Yes, now.

36:09.458 --> 36:10.792
No way.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.670
Welcome to Rome, sir.

36:36.319 --> 36:41.114
So, Hawk. The Hawkster.
What do you think of the vehicle?

36:41.282 --> 36:45.619
Why did you duck
at the auction house, asshole?

36:45.786 --> 36:48.705
What can I tell you. I'm the villain.

36:48.873 --> 36:51.917
Initially, it was a priority to keep
a lot of buffers between you and me.

36:52.084 --> 36:54.878
But since most of them are dead now,
I thought, what the heck?

36:55.046 --> 36:58.381
Hawkie, you come
highly recommended.

36:58.549 --> 37:02.719
I hired Kaplan and the Mario brothers
to find me a cat burglar.

37:02.887 --> 37:05.972
Hey. I want to be in business
with you.

37:15.233 --> 37:20.695
♪ I've got the power ♪

37:26.661 --> 37:29.412
Ladies and gentlemen of the board,
and Minerva...

37:29.580 --> 37:32.499
let's give it up for Hudson Hawk.

37:35.753 --> 37:37.087
Minerva.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.630
Minerva!

37:39.465 --> 37:44.344
Hello. Bunny, ball-ball.

37:44.512 --> 37:45.637
So, Hawkmeister...

37:45.805 --> 37:47.639
we got you clothes, great hotel...

37:47.807 --> 37:50.684
and a 250,000-lire per diem.

37:50.851 --> 37:52.018
That's $200 a day.

37:52.186 --> 37:54.104
So he can get a hooker
and some tequila?

37:54.272 --> 37:55.647
Veto, Darwin.

37:55.815 --> 38:00.318
I guess we see who wears
the penis in this family?

38:00.486 --> 38:03.905
For God's sake,
somebody chain this convict.

38:05.825 --> 38:06.992
Listen, Hawkie.

38:07.159 --> 38:10.954
This might be hard to believe,
but I'm just a regular joe.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.125
I just want to be happy.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.501
And happiness comes...

38:16.669 --> 38:18.503
from the achieving of goals.

38:19.714 --> 38:24.426
It's just that when you've made
your first billion by the age of 19...

38:24.593 --> 38:27.387
it's hard to keep
coming up with new ones.

38:27.555 --> 38:32.142
But now, finally,
I got myself a new goal:

38:32.768 --> 38:35.020
World domination!

38:45.031 --> 38:46.489
Shut up!

38:46.657 --> 38:49.701
- Bunny, quit that.
- Bunny, ball-ball.

38:49.869 --> 38:51.911
I think Bunny's got
today's ball-balls.

38:52.079 --> 38:55.081
- Bad Bunny.
- Bunny, you weren't that bad.

38:55.249 --> 38:58.335
Just two more minutes.
I was so close.

38:58.502 --> 39:03.256
But seriously, folks, Concorde me
back home, put me in jail. I don't care.

39:03.424 --> 39:07.469
You go back to jail,
and you won't be alone.

39:07.636 --> 39:12.766
You'll have a Guinea barkeep
cellmate to keep you company.

39:12.933 --> 39:15.518
You're young enough to still enjoy
shanking child molesters...

39:15.686 --> 39:19.105
for a pack of smokes.

39:19.273 --> 39:21.274
But Tommy Five-Tone...

39:21.442 --> 39:23.860
will go in knowing
the next time he gets out...

39:24.028 --> 39:26.946
will be to attend
his own funeral.

39:32.036 --> 39:34.037
Depressing?

39:36.832 --> 39:39.000
I wouldn't waste a dime
for the phone call.

39:39.168 --> 39:41.086
You don't have any proof.

39:41.253 --> 39:43.546
The magic word.

39:43.714 --> 39:47.467
It's "véjà du," Hawkhead:
Something you wish never did happen.

39:47.635 --> 39:51.638
Kaplan and his CIA candy bars shot
the entire operation with hidden cameras.

39:51.806 --> 39:56.643
They put the fake horse in the safe while
you clowns were running from the guards.

40:00.648 --> 40:02.524
Yikes.

40:02.691 --> 40:04.192
Damn Fotomat assholes.

40:04.360 --> 40:05.760
That's a good shot of you, Minerva.

40:05.820 --> 40:09.239
My man, you're going
to hit a church.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.908
We want you to steal
da Vinci's sketchbook...

40:12.076 --> 40:15.620
the Codex.

40:15.788 --> 40:17.789
The Vatican.

40:17.957 --> 40:20.792
I'm robbing
the freaking Vatican.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.461
The nuns at St. Agnes...

40:23.629 --> 40:25.338
predicted this.

40:25.506 --> 40:27.674
What do they call you guys,
Igg and Ook?

40:57.955 --> 40:59.247
- Hey, man.
- Buon giorno.

40:59.415 --> 41:00.582
Yeah, buon giorno.

41:00.749 --> 41:02.083
I'm being blackmailed
into robbing the Vatican...

41:02.251 --> 41:05.086
by a psychotic
American corporation and the CIA.

41:05.254 --> 41:07.839
I don't...

41:08.007 --> 41:10.967
That's okay, colonel.
Just keep an eye on all the art.

42:03.938 --> 42:05.271
Courtney, stop it.

42:05.439 --> 42:07.232
You're embarrassing
your country.

42:17.243 --> 42:19.661
Though Leonardo
is best known as a painter...

42:19.828 --> 42:21.955
it was his gift as an inventor...

42:22.122 --> 42:25.583
who drew together
science and art...

42:25.751 --> 42:28.127
that is most incredible.

42:33.509 --> 42:35.009
Tough guy.

42:35.177 --> 42:37.095
What are you doing here?

42:37.263 --> 42:40.848
You know, every time I get around you,
my heart starts beating really fast.

42:44.770 --> 42:46.437
As you know,
the Da Vinci Codex...

42:46.605 --> 42:50.775
has lived in the Vatican for centuries, and
will continue to live here for centuries more.

42:50.943 --> 42:52.944
That's what you think.

42:53.112 --> 42:56.072
- Question, sir?
- Yeah, what time do you get done?

42:56.240 --> 42:59.075
His untiring pen
predicted the airplane...

42:59.243 --> 43:01.744
the submarine, the bicycle...

43:01.912 --> 43:04.414
the helicopter
and even the tank.

43:04.582 --> 43:06.791
These more dangerous designs
inspired him...

43:06.959 --> 43:08.334
Pokey!

43:23.017 --> 43:24.559
- What's the matter? Something wrong?
- Quickly, come with me.

43:24.727 --> 43:26.603
Pokey, come back!

43:30.733 --> 43:32.025
Is that smoke bad for you?

43:32.610 --> 43:33.890
- This way.
- Where are we going?

43:33.944 --> 43:35.278
Through here.

43:42.328 --> 43:45.747
Are you gonna tell me why you did that back
there, or are you gonna blame it on Dumbo?

43:45.914 --> 43:47.290
You mean Pokey?

43:47.458 --> 43:50.043
You believe that
kooky little elephant?

43:51.462 --> 43:54.839
- What in the world is this?
- It's a postal subway.

43:55.007 --> 43:58.217
- Can I get to Times Square from here?
- No.

43:58.385 --> 44:00.094
The pope takes his mail seriously.

44:00.262 --> 44:02.096
Christmas cards, Easter Seals.

44:02.264 --> 44:04.390
Delivers up to 10 at night.

44:04.558 --> 44:06.601
I see.

44:06.769 --> 44:09.270
Well, actually, I don't see.
I'm very confused.

44:09.438 --> 44:11.648
How do you know all this stuff?
What do you do?

44:11.815 --> 44:14.275
Well, I do a lot of things.

44:14.443 --> 44:17.070
But I don't steal stuffed elephants
from little girls.

44:17.613 --> 44:19.447
My life's pretty boring.

44:20.240 --> 44:22.575
Yeah, mine too.

44:23.952 --> 44:25.495
You have dinner
with me tonight?

44:25.663 --> 44:27.330
Nice, dull, boring dinner?

44:27.498 --> 44:31.584
Scrabble, knock-knock jokes,
anecdotes about dead Italians?

44:31.752 --> 44:34.337
I'll bring my entire repertoire.

44:39.468 --> 44:41.594
And I'll bring my entire entourage.

44:41.762 --> 44:43.221
There's a place around the corner.

44:43.389 --> 44:46.724
- Enzo's. Say 10:30?
- Ten-thirty.

44:46.892 --> 44:49.143
Hey, thanks.

44:57.027 --> 45:00.113
Father, it's obvious
he's up to something.

45:00.280 --> 45:01.948
Report upstairs at once.

45:02.116 --> 45:03.574
Yes, sir.

45:15.254 --> 45:16.629
Did he mention the Mayflowers?

45:16.797 --> 45:19.966
No, your eminence. He's definitely
going to steal the Codex. I can feel it.

45:20.134 --> 45:22.677
- I'm not sure when.
- Attempt to steal, you mean.

45:22.845 --> 45:25.221
The vanity of this man,
Hudson Hawk.

45:25.389 --> 45:29.308
The Vatican has foiled the advances
of pirates and terrorists.

45:29.476 --> 45:33.563
We will not lie down
for some schmuck from New Jersey.

45:33.731 --> 45:40.194
And must you flirt with him
so effectively?

45:40.362 --> 45:42.155
That's the only way.

45:42.322 --> 45:46.284
As an agent of our organization,
you are put in awkward situations.

45:46.452 --> 45:50.663
Just remember, Hudson Hawk
is an evil, evil man.

46:10.517 --> 46:13.144
Yes. Hello, operator.
I'd like to make a collect call...

46:13.312 --> 46:16.647
overseas, to a New York number.

46:16.815 --> 46:18.983
What? No, no, don't put me...

46:23.530 --> 46:25.281
- Oh, shit.
- Thank you for calling AT&T.

46:25.449 --> 46:27.033
What number
are you calling, please?

46:27.201 --> 46:31.829
Thank God. 212-555-1989.

46:38.003 --> 46:42.757
Pick up the phone, you
reindeer-goat-cheese-eating bastard.

46:44.051 --> 46:45.593
Pick it up. Pick it up.

46:46.512 --> 46:48.346
Pick it up, Tommy.

46:48.514 --> 46:51.641
The black thing. On the desk.

46:53.310 --> 46:55.186
Come on, Tommy.

47:09.243 --> 47:10.785
Want a little more, Jumbo?

47:10.953 --> 47:13.204
Kick your big, flabby ass.

47:13.747 --> 47:15.289
Hawk.

47:15.457 --> 47:19.585
Hawk, Hawk.

47:19.753 --> 47:22.213
- Enjoying Italy?
- Yeah.

47:22.381 --> 47:24.340
Yes.

47:24.508 --> 47:28.302
I've always had
a soft spot in my heart for Roma.

47:28.470 --> 47:32.807
I did my first
bare-handed strangulation here.

47:32.975 --> 47:34.684
Communist politician.

47:34.852 --> 47:36.394
Why, George, you big softy.

47:36.562 --> 47:40.481
God, I miss Communism.

47:40.649 --> 47:42.608
The Red threat.

47:42.776 --> 47:46.237
People were scared...

47:46.405 --> 47:52.535
the agency had some respect,
and I got laid every night.

47:52.703 --> 47:54.495
Brief him, Snickers.

47:54.663 --> 47:55.997
Good news, Hawk.

47:56.164 --> 47:58.040
Mayflowers have
moved up the timetable.

47:58.208 --> 48:00.459
- You're hitting the Vatican tonight.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

48:00.627 --> 48:02.503
The timing's off,
the schedule's not right...

48:02.671 --> 48:05.006
I'm underequipped,
and besides that, I got a date.

48:05.173 --> 48:06.757
Grapple, biker's bottle...

48:06.925 --> 48:08.551
pocket fisherman, olive oil...

48:08.719 --> 48:09.927
100 stamps?

48:10.095 --> 48:12.138
Gee, stud, this gonna be some date.

48:12.306 --> 48:13.639
No Harvey's Bristol Cream?

48:13.807 --> 48:16.309
Snickers, make that list happen.

48:17.185 --> 48:18.895
Oh, it's one thing
to play hide-and-seek...

48:19.062 --> 48:21.314
with the Mayflowers'
pathetic staff...

48:21.481 --> 48:23.482
but we're sore losers.

48:23.650 --> 48:25.610
We blow up space shuttles
for breakfast.

48:25.777 --> 48:28.279
You and your friend Tommy
would be nothing more than a...

48:28.447 --> 48:30.323
A late-afternoon Triscuit.

48:30.490 --> 48:31.866
Ciao.

48:32.993 --> 48:34.827
Hey! Old man!

48:34.995 --> 48:36.537
Yeah, you!

48:36.705 --> 48:39.123
You come back here
without your Cub Scout army...

48:39.291 --> 48:40.917
and I'll kick your
centrally intelligent ass...

48:41.084 --> 48:44.128
up one side the piazza
and down the other!

48:52.763 --> 48:54.722
"Beware the blue wire"?

48:56.475 --> 48:58.768
Hey, Mr. Hawk, I got your stamps.

48:58.936 --> 49:00.519
Good, Yogi.

51:00.098 --> 51:02.767
Now, Kit Kat, how did you know
about that blue wire?

53:38.131 --> 53:40.674
I was afraid
you weren't gonna drop by.

53:40.842 --> 53:42.635
Am I late?

53:51.186 --> 53:52.728
You look very nice.

53:52.896 --> 53:55.064
You really do.

53:55.232 --> 53:56.941
- What?
- I am the waiter, sir.

53:57.108 --> 53:59.777
Oh, very nice.

53:59.945 --> 54:03.155
Fettuccine con funghi porcini.
Prego.

54:03.323 --> 54:06.450
And bring me a bottle of ketchup
with that, will you?

54:06.618 --> 54:08.202
You heard him.

54:08.370 --> 54:10.496
Ketchup. Ketchup.

54:10.664 --> 54:12.122
Stupid Americano!

54:15.085 --> 54:18.087
Come on, Pierre, read my lips.

54:18.255 --> 54:20.089
Steak burger.

54:20.257 --> 54:22.591
French fries.

54:22.759 --> 54:24.760
This is France.
You got to have french fries.

54:24.928 --> 54:26.929
"Actually, it's Italy, Butterfinger,"
she said...

54:27.097 --> 54:28.889
as if it made a difference.

54:32.477 --> 54:34.853
To be in Paris and in love.

54:39.234 --> 54:42.027
They had the worst ketchup
when I was in prison.

54:42.320 --> 54:45.030
Prison?

54:45.198 --> 54:46.991
I was a warden?

54:47.867 --> 54:49.326
How long were you in?

54:49.494 --> 54:53.664
Let's just say I never saw E.T.

54:53.832 --> 54:57.501
You were in the joint...

54:57.669 --> 55:01.255
doing hard time.

55:01.423 --> 55:05.175
It's funny, but that excites me.

55:05.343 --> 55:07.845
I seem to have a thing for sinners.

55:08.013 --> 55:10.723
I seem to have a thing for sinning.
Check, please.

55:12.392 --> 55:13.892
Where did you get the Hawk?

55:14.060 --> 55:16.478
Ossining, New York.

55:16.646 --> 55:19.398
Where did you get the
Hudson Hawk?

55:19.566 --> 55:22.693
Well, a "hawk" is a slang word...

55:22.861 --> 55:26.238
for the cold wind
that blows in the wintertime.

55:26.406 --> 55:28.657
I grew up in a town
called Hoboken, New Jersey...

55:28.825 --> 55:30.105
which is on the Hudson River.

55:30.243 --> 55:34.705
- So Hudson River, Hudson Hawk.
- Hudson Hawk.

55:34.873 --> 55:37.458
And where did you get these?

55:37.625 --> 55:39.251
Had a little accident
around the house.

55:39.419 --> 55:41.962
- What happened?
- I fell on some chickens.

55:42.130 --> 55:43.881
- Does it hurt?
- Yes, they hurt.

55:44.049 --> 55:46.008
Maybe I can make them
feel better.

55:46.176 --> 55:49.345
Well, okay. See what you can do.

56:00.607 --> 56:02.191
Don't. Don't tickle me.
Don't do it.

56:02.359 --> 56:03.442
Don't do it because...

56:03.610 --> 56:05.736
Because I gotta
tell you something.

56:05.904 --> 56:07.154
What?

56:07.322 --> 56:09.406
No, I better whisper it to you.

56:09.574 --> 56:11.367
Come here.

56:13.453 --> 56:15.829
I can't do this.

56:19.501 --> 56:21.335
What's the matter?

56:21.503 --> 56:23.087
It's been a long time for me.

56:23.254 --> 56:25.464
Well, it's been a really long time
for me.

56:25.632 --> 56:29.426
Outside of a friendly dog yesterday
morning, this has been a very slow decade.

56:30.303 --> 56:34.723
I don't make love every 10 years,
I get a little cranky.

56:36.184 --> 56:38.685
I'm not sure if I remember
how to kiss girls.

56:40.480 --> 56:42.648
Not that I ever kiss guys.

56:52.450 --> 56:53.909
Catholic girls are scary.

56:54.077 --> 56:57.079
- Somebody robbed the Vatican.
- Really?

57:02.627 --> 57:05.337
This is not what you think.
Well, maybe it is.

57:05.505 --> 57:07.798
You went and did it.
You really did it.

57:07.966 --> 57:11.093
In one day, in less than one day
of planning, and you did it.

57:11.261 --> 57:13.137
You started the week
by stealing the Sforza...

57:13.304 --> 57:15.184
- and ended by swiping the Codex.
- Yeah, but...

57:15.223 --> 57:17.808
What are your weekend plans?
Hoisting away the Colosseum?

57:17.976 --> 57:20.853
- But you don't...
- Tell me, did the devil make you do it?

57:21.020 --> 57:23.814
Or did Darwin
and Minerva Mayflower?

57:23.982 --> 57:26.108
Can't we just go back
to the kissing part?

57:29.320 --> 57:30.988
What's going on in there?

57:31.156 --> 57:33.532
You want me to rape them?

57:36.035 --> 57:38.662
Here, just read your book,
Butterfinger.

57:44.461 --> 57:46.879
"Not in a boat, not on a train."

57:47.046 --> 57:49.965
Not with a goat, not in the rain.

57:50.133 --> 57:53.135
- "I do not like green eggs and ham..."
- To yourself. To yourself!

57:53.928 --> 57:55.929
It's more complicated
than that, Hudson.

57:56.097 --> 57:58.640
For two years, I've been tracking
the Mayflowers' peculiar interest...

57:58.808 --> 58:00.100
in the three da Vinci pieces.

58:00.268 --> 58:01.768
The Sforza statue was a fake...

58:01.936 --> 58:04.480
but I was under orders
not to denounce it.

58:04.647 --> 58:07.774
Does everybody in the whole world
know more than me?

58:07.942 --> 58:09.735
- You didn't know?
- No.

58:09.903 --> 58:14.281
I'm just some guy
that's good at swiping stuff.

58:14.449 --> 58:16.742
Who knew that would lead to this.

58:18.411 --> 58:20.871
Christ, they even got
the CIA Involved now.

58:22.248 --> 58:24.124
Here's looking at you, kid.

58:26.628 --> 58:30.005
Hey. This doesn't taste
like cappuccino.

58:30.173 --> 58:34.259
I guess I put too much
ethyl chloride in it.

58:37.430 --> 58:40.807
Why didn't you say at the restaurant
that Hawk had hit the Vatican tonight?

58:40.975 --> 58:42.601
My people will not be happy.

58:42.769 --> 58:44.228
I want to see Kaplan.

58:52.820 --> 58:56.156
Damn meddlesome
Vatican organization.

58:58.034 --> 59:00.035
Hey! Way to go, Anna!

59:00.203 --> 59:02.204
Hudson Hawk had
some interesting things to say...

59:02.372 --> 59:04.373
about you and the Mayflowers.

59:04.541 --> 59:07.209
Basically, that you're all part
of the same car pool.

59:07.377 --> 59:11.755
Anna, Anna, Anna,
if that were so...

59:11.923 --> 59:13.643
Almond Joy would've
handed you your heart...

59:13.675 --> 59:16.051
right after you handed her
the Codex.

59:16.219 --> 59:18.095
No, now the trip is this:

59:18.263 --> 59:20.722
Soon as the Mayflowers find out
we have the Codex...

59:20.890 --> 59:22.370
they're gonna want to make a deal.

59:22.433 --> 59:25.060
We deal, they'll buy, we bust.

59:25.228 --> 59:28.063
- A classic sting.
- What happens to Hudson Hawk?

59:28.231 --> 59:31.066
I wouldn't worry too much
about him. He's...

59:31.234 --> 59:33.193
He's gonna be in very good hands.

59:33.361 --> 59:36.071
But you, you look really tired, kiddo.

59:36.239 --> 59:38.279
Maybe you should go back
to Rome and get some sleep.

59:38.283 --> 59:43.245
Kit Kat? Oh, there you are.

59:43.413 --> 59:46.373
See that Miss Baragli
gets home safely.

59:48.209 --> 59:50.085
Arrividerci, baby.

59:52.672 --> 59:54.715
With all due respect
to that great dress...

59:54.882 --> 59:56.592
how come you didn't you let me
cut her heart out?

59:56.759 --> 01:00:00.012
Close call, close call.

01:00:00.179 --> 01:00:05.183
But she's the only way we have keeping tabs
on the damn mysterious Vatican organization.

01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:12.024
Bunny Mayflower.

01:00:13.484 --> 01:00:14.964
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

01:00:15.069 --> 01:00:17.654
It's been 1200 hours
since my last confession.

01:00:17.822 --> 01:00:19.865
Hit me with your best shot.

01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:21.950
I betrayed a man.

01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:24.911
A good man. An innocent man.

01:00:25.079 --> 01:00:26.288
A thief.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:29.041
Anna, what are you trying to say?

01:00:29.208 --> 01:00:32.127
Father, we've been
double-crossed by the CIA.

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:34.630
Hudson Hawk is not
who we thought he was.

01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:37.758
He came into a world where crime
is a legitimate business tactic...

01:00:37.925 --> 01:00:39.801
and a legitimate
government procedure...

01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:41.887
but he knew right from wrong.

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:44.431
Oh, and we kind of messed around.

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:50.854
Messed around? Messed around?!

01:00:53.441 --> 01:00:57.778
Seventeen Hail Marys
and five minutes outside.

01:00:57.945 --> 01:01:02.658
So, Sister, what you are saying
is that Hudson Hawk...

01:01:02.825 --> 01:01:05.077
is not willingly working
for the Mayflowers...

01:01:05.244 --> 01:01:09.373
but that Kaplan
and the candy bars are?

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:11.667
I thought we were using the CIA
to get to Mayflower...

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:15.045
but the CIA is using me
to keep us away from Mayflower.

01:01:15.213 --> 01:01:18.632
The pope warned me
never to trust the CIA.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.968
If the Mayflowers get all three crystals
for the gold machine...

01:01:22.136 --> 01:01:24.596
the world economy will be ruined.

01:01:24.764 --> 01:01:27.140
Ay-yi-yi.

01:01:27.308 --> 01:01:29.101
Lord help us.

01:01:29.268 --> 01:01:33.647
But what of Tommy Five-Tone,
Hawk's friend? Where's his loyalty?

01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:35.023
I'm going to find out.

01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:36.608
But you must remember, Sister...

01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:40.320
you have your vows to God
as well as your mission to the world.

01:01:40.488 --> 01:01:43.699
Yes, Your Eminence.

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:45.200
Just say, "God go with me."

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:47.577
God go with you, Sister.

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:50.706
Ball!

01:01:57.296 --> 01:01:59.214
Jolly good shot, sir.

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:03.552
Hudson Hawk.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.846
You cease to amaze me, convict.

01:02:06.013 --> 01:02:08.223
You are a terrible cat burglar.

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:10.475
Haven't you ever seen,
like, David Niven?

01:02:10.643 --> 01:02:12.310
Tiptoe in, tiptoe out.

01:02:12.478 --> 01:02:14.563
Like a cat, one would say.

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:18.108
I could take it back.

01:02:18.276 --> 01:02:21.027
- Let me do that.
- I don't care.

01:02:31.539 --> 01:02:35.625
Oh, you two! There's nothing
I hate more than failure.

01:02:35.793 --> 01:02:37.669
All you had to do
was follow the Hawk.

01:02:37.837 --> 01:02:41.673
It's not like I said teach
our nation's children how to read.

01:02:41.841 --> 01:02:43.759
I suppose we're just going to
have to kill them.

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:52.601
God, Minerva, I was just joking.

01:03:06.741 --> 01:03:09.951
- Get away from there, convict.
- Just browsing.

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:13.705
Don't hurt him.
We need him for the final job.

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:16.124
Oh, really?

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:17.876
Don't hurt him?

01:03:18.044 --> 01:03:20.587
Even if he does this?

01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:23.089
What about this?

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:27.135
Surely, this must offend!

01:03:28.429 --> 01:03:32.098
Things are really heating up
at the Castle Vinci tonight!

01:03:32.266 --> 01:03:33.892
Mamma mia, pizzeria!

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:35.101
May I call you Minnie?

01:03:35.269 --> 01:03:38.313
You put your left foot in
You put your left foot out.

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:40.232
Come to think of it,
there is a part of your body...

01:03:40.399 --> 01:03:44.319
that you won't be needing
for your next job.

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:46.571
I always did wanna
sing like Frankie Valli.

01:03:46.739 --> 01:03:50.283
Big boys don't cry.

01:03:51.744 --> 01:03:56.331
Three minutes, 27 seconds.

01:03:59.377 --> 01:04:00.877
Look, you Eddie Munster-looking
motherfucker...

01:04:01.045 --> 01:04:04.246
somebody better tell me what's going on,
or I ain't gonna move another muscle.

01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:06.758
- I wanna be treated like an adult.
- That's fair.

01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:09.886
Now go to your room.

01:04:12.431 --> 01:04:13.723
What?

01:04:19.564 --> 01:04:22.107
So, Captain Hawk,
in one of your paws...

01:04:22.275 --> 01:04:25.151
you've got a gold bar
worth about eight thou.

01:04:25.319 --> 01:04:28.905
In the autre, you've got lead
that won't get you gelato.

01:04:29.073 --> 01:04:32.325
Surely a master thief like you
can tell the difference.

01:04:32.493 --> 01:04:34.661
That's one down. Kitty Carlisle.

01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:36.204
Cool, isn't it?

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:40.208
Weight, feel, malleability.
They're all but identical.

01:04:40.376 --> 01:04:44.170
On the periodic chart of elements
they're but one proton apart.

01:04:44.338 --> 01:04:49.301
Great minds worked for centuries
to turn worthless into priceless.

01:04:49.468 --> 01:04:50.510
Alchemy?

01:04:50.678 --> 01:04:53.179
Alchemy is the business term
of the '90s, my man.

01:04:53.347 --> 01:04:57.100
Minerva read it in an airline magazine
about four years ago.

01:04:57.268 --> 01:05:00.687
I dumped some lire into research
and, shazam!

01:05:00.855 --> 01:05:03.481
We come across a diary
by one of da Vinci's assistants...

01:05:03.649 --> 01:05:06.735
detailing la macchina d'oro...

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:09.029
"The gold machine,"
for the hoes at home.

01:05:09.196 --> 01:05:11.573
And the rest is
about to become history.

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:13.408
Money isn't everything.

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:15.160
Gold is.

01:05:15.328 --> 01:05:16.411
Fuck T-bills!

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:17.913
Fuck blue-chip stocks!

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.289
Fuck junk bonds!

01:05:19.457 --> 01:05:21.249
We've got the real deal.

01:05:21.417 --> 01:05:23.251
Money will always be paper...

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:26.922
but gold will always be gold.

01:05:27.089 --> 01:05:28.930
After a couple of years
of steady production...

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:30.730
we'll flood the market
with so much gold...

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.637
that gold itself,
the foundation of all finance...

01:05:33.804 --> 01:05:35.263
will lose its meaning.

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:38.099
Brokers, economists,
fellow entrepreneurs...

01:05:38.267 --> 01:05:42.062
will drown in the saliva
of their own nervous breakdowns.

01:05:42.229 --> 01:05:43.271
Sounds like a party.

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:45.231
Markets will crash-crash.

01:05:45.399 --> 01:05:48.360
Financial empires
will crumble-crumble.

01:05:48.527 --> 01:05:50.487
Except yours-yours.

01:05:50.655 --> 01:05:53.323
In 1992, baby...

01:05:53.491 --> 01:05:55.158
the European superpowers
are coming together...

01:05:55.326 --> 01:05:57.661
to form one business superpower.

01:05:57.828 --> 01:06:00.914
And that's one party
we're gonna love to poop.

01:06:01.082 --> 01:06:02.207
Well, that's set.

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:06.878
The last ingredient in the recipe
is da Vinci's model of a helicopter.

01:06:07.046 --> 01:06:10.757
On display for three days only
at the Louvre, in Paris.

01:06:10.925 --> 01:06:12.509
As opposed to the Louvre
in Wisconsin?

01:06:12.677 --> 01:06:14.511
Shut up.
You'll make me lose my place.

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:16.179
You're gonna have
to go in at night.

01:06:16.347 --> 01:06:18.598
- The security will be overwhelming.
- Twelve guards...

01:06:18.766 --> 01:06:22.102
Okay, time out.

01:06:22.269 --> 01:06:25.063
I choose not to accept
the assignment, Mr. Phelps.

01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:26.391
Put me in jail. Put me and...

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:27.899
Jail, you asshole?!

01:06:28.067 --> 01:06:31.069
Our foot soldiers
will blow your brains out.

01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:32.904
Bunny? Ball-ball.

01:06:33.948 --> 01:06:36.866
I'll torture you so slowly,
you'll think it's a career.

01:06:37.034 --> 01:06:40.745
I'll kill your friends, your family
and the bitch you took to the prom.

01:06:40.913 --> 01:06:43.498
Betty Jo Biarsky? I can get you
an address on that, if you want.

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:45.500
You have a dilemma, tiger.

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:48.962
And I think I know what's gonna
help you solve it.

01:06:54.135 --> 01:06:55.802
I'll kill you all!

01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:59.556
I swear to God. I'll kill that butler.
I'll kill that little yappy dog.

01:06:59.724 --> 01:07:03.560
I'm sick of this!

01:07:07.481 --> 01:07:11.818
I hated cigarettes until I saw
my first "no smoking" sign.

01:07:11.986 --> 01:07:14.154
"Keep off the grass"?

01:07:14.321 --> 01:07:16.156
Let's play soccer.

01:07:16.323 --> 01:07:19.200
The only law I cared for
was friendship.

01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:22.704
I broke that one, too, didn't I?

01:07:25.082 --> 01:07:28.710
I just don't think that it's such a smoking-hot
idea to leave them in there alone.

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:29.919
Relax, George.

01:07:30.087 --> 01:07:32.922
That's why we hired the
pasta-slurping Guinea to begin with...

01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:34.257
to keep Hawk in line.

01:07:34.425 --> 01:07:37.510
This Gates-Mario brothers-
CIA-Mayflower-da Vinci thing...

01:07:37.678 --> 01:07:41.723
I mean, it seemed like
a sweet deal.

01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:43.933
Visit foreign lands,
take their treasures.

01:07:44.101 --> 01:07:46.436
I don't know, Eddie,
I thought you'd get into it.

01:07:46.604 --> 01:07:51.399
It's better than playing darts
with M.B.A.s at the bar.

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:54.319
But I didn't think
it was gonna be like this.

01:07:54.487 --> 01:07:58.364
Them using me to use you.

01:07:58.532 --> 01:08:02.494
I'm sorry, Eddie...

01:08:02.661 --> 01:08:06.039
but there's only
one way out of this...

01:08:06.207 --> 01:08:09.918
and it's gonna hurt me
more than it's gonna hurt you.

01:08:13.047 --> 01:08:16.049
They'll talk about being buddies
and chugging brewskis.

01:08:16.216 --> 01:08:18.510
You've got to love male bonding.

01:08:29.647 --> 01:08:31.814
You fucked my freedom
for a lousy job?

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:37.278
Come on!

01:08:43.661 --> 01:08:45.078
- You know something, Eddie?
- What?

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:47.788
- You hit like a girl!
- Oh, really?

01:08:48.749 --> 01:08:50.166
I was only kidding.

01:08:58.384 --> 01:09:00.510
Tommy! No!

01:09:00.678 --> 01:09:02.595
Tommy!

01:09:16.484 --> 01:09:19.696
Plan B, George.

01:09:23.283 --> 01:09:24.450
Plan B?

01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:55.106
No sweat, Tommy. You just made
the biggest mistake of my life.

01:09:55.274 --> 01:09:57.525
Don't act like you never
committed a crime before.

01:09:57.693 --> 01:09:59.819
- I know I made a bad call.
- What was your per diem?

01:09:59.987 --> 01:10:03.031
- Thank God you're dead.
- It was so beautiful.

01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:06.826
When those blanks went off,
everybody freaked.

01:10:08.412 --> 01:10:11.456
- Ketchup. You can't beat Heinz 57.
- Five-Tone.

01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:13.583
- What?
- You fucked my freedom for a job?

01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:16.377
- You don't understand.
- I said I was sorry.

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:18.338
You better be glad I don't hit women,
assuming you are a woman,

01:10:18.505 --> 01:10:20.298
because from now on,
I ain't taking nothing for granted.

01:10:20.466 --> 01:10:21.758
- Hey, look, Eddie, I'm sorry.
- Hudson, I'm sorry.

01:10:21.926 --> 01:10:24.552
I work for a covert Vatican
humanitarian organization...

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.387
and the CIA
made a fool out of me.

01:10:26.555 --> 01:10:27.847
- What's more...
- Hey, man...

01:10:28.015 --> 01:10:31.017
I care for you... I love you.

01:10:31.185 --> 01:10:33.228
- Then what's this?
- Where did you get that?

01:10:33.395 --> 01:10:34.771
The da Vinci castle.

01:10:34.939 --> 01:10:37.482
You know, the place where you
gave the bad guys the Codex.

01:10:37.650 --> 01:10:39.734
- That's from the gold machine.
- Yeah.

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:41.486
So they really were that
close to making it work.

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:44.574
But now that they lost the services
of the world's greatest cat burglar...

01:10:44.698 --> 01:10:45.865
and his dead partner...

01:10:46.033 --> 01:10:48.117
They won't be able to steal
the third piece of the crystal.

01:10:48.285 --> 01:10:51.454
And we get to go home.

01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:53.998
- Five-Tone, let me ask you something.
- Go ahead.

01:10:54.166 --> 01:10:56.927
Why do they leave all these rocks
and shit laying out in the backyard?

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:58.544
They're called ruins, Eddie.

01:10:58.712 --> 01:11:00.421
- Ruins?
- Yeah, ruins.

01:11:00.589 --> 01:11:02.590
Good name.

01:11:07.721 --> 01:11:12.225
He had this look on his face
when we caught him. It was like...

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:14.769
I never saw a look on a face like this
when he got caught.

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:17.230
I swear to God,
he was so embarrassed.

01:11:17.398 --> 01:11:19.440
You know,
speaking of being caught...

01:11:19.608 --> 01:11:22.068
isn't the CIA gonna think
to check out this place?

01:11:22.236 --> 01:11:23.861
No, they fell for the fake death.

01:11:24.029 --> 01:11:26.656
They think Hawk's been arrested.

01:11:26.824 --> 01:11:30.201
Kaplan and the candy bars were seen
by my sources boarding a plane out of Rome.

01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:32.120
- Hudson.
- Where to?

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:33.997
Five-Tone, will you quit
worrying about it, man.

01:11:34.164 --> 01:11:36.749
I'm not worried, alright,
I'm just being cautious.

01:11:36.917 --> 01:11:40.003
Okay, guys.
On that note, it's time for bed.

01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:42.171
- I couldn't agree more.
- Okay.

01:11:45.801 --> 01:11:48.011
Tommy, you're gonna sleep here.

01:11:48.178 --> 01:11:51.306
- Where are you gonna sleep?
- What do you think?

01:11:51.473 --> 01:11:52.682
Oh, yeah. Good night.

01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:54.392
I'll get you some sheets.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.477
Yeah, we'll get you some sheets.

01:12:00.816 --> 01:12:03.693
- It's a very special night.
- Yes, it was.

01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:05.778
- Is.
- Was.

01:12:05.946 --> 01:12:08.072
There's some things
you don't know about me.

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.158
But there's some things
I do know about you...

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:14.203
and about me,
and about that bed.

01:12:14.371 --> 01:12:16.706
This is not the time, Hudson.

01:12:17.207 --> 01:12:20.960
Look, can't we just have
a late-night cappuccino?

01:12:21.128 --> 01:12:25.173
I'm sorry, but the machine's
still set up for poisonous foam.

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:30.678
- Yeah. I remember.
- Good night.

01:12:30.846 --> 01:12:32.680
Good night.

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:41.647
Don't even think about it.

01:12:41.815 --> 01:12:43.358
Don't say another word.

01:12:43.525 --> 01:12:46.486
It's a very special night.

01:12:47.279 --> 01:12:49.238
Very funny. Very funny, Tommy.

01:13:10.677 --> 01:13:12.053
Good morning.

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:16.307
The license plates on the police van
had a Vatican prefix.

01:13:16.475 --> 01:13:18.184
I'm losing respect for you guys.

01:13:18.352 --> 01:13:22.146
You were that close
to getting away with this crap.

01:13:22.314 --> 01:13:23.773
- Get up.
- Now, where's Anna?

01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:25.525
You know, George,
it's nice of you guys to drop by...

01:13:25.692 --> 01:13:28.027
but next time,
you might want to phone ahead.

01:13:28.195 --> 01:13:29.756
Why don't you come back in a half-hour.

01:13:29.863 --> 01:13:32.448
Grab ourselves a shower,
pick up some croissants and shit.

01:13:32.616 --> 01:13:37.078
I really wish I could come up with this
glib repartee, the way you guys can.

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:40.790
But I can't.
So I'll just paralyze you. A. J?

01:13:43.127 --> 01:13:44.168
Curare darts.

01:13:44.336 --> 01:13:45.837
When it comes
to instantaneous loss...

01:13:46.004 --> 01:13:47.880
of all physical control
below the neck...

01:13:48.048 --> 01:13:51.050
- I highly recommend them.
- Eddie, I can't move!

01:13:51.218 --> 01:13:53.594
I'm gonna rip
their fucking tongues out!

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:56.222
Come here, you chickenshit
son of a bitches!

01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:59.684
Come here!
My head against yours.

01:13:59.852 --> 01:14:01.060
Fair fight!

01:14:01.228 --> 01:14:03.771
This is how I go out.
Like a hunk of frozen Play-Doh?

01:14:03.939 --> 01:14:05.857
Like a Gumby in the store?

01:14:06.024 --> 01:14:08.067
What the fuck are you la...?
Keep laughing, Jumbo.

01:14:08.235 --> 01:14:09.610
You made it come out of my nose.

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:10.820
Keep that shit up!

01:14:10.988 --> 01:14:13.906
This is no way, George,
to get me to rob the Louvre.

01:14:14.074 --> 01:14:16.534
The Louvre?

01:14:16.702 --> 01:14:21.831
The Louvre, Hawk,
is yesterday's news.

01:14:21.999 --> 01:14:24.208
Or should I say this morning's?

01:14:24.376 --> 01:14:26.335
I admit we displayed
a lack of nuance.

01:14:26.503 --> 01:14:29.005
Didn't wear black,
didn't sing "Swinging on a Star."

01:14:29.173 --> 01:14:32.133
Well, we weren't being judged
for neatness...

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:34.051
only results.

01:14:34.219 --> 01:14:36.304
Goddamn it. Yanks lose again.

01:14:36.472 --> 01:14:40.057
- How did the Mets do?
- Can you turn to section B.

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:45.980
You guys may be
the fairest cat burglars of them all...

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:48.107
but if you weren't
such snobs...

01:14:48.275 --> 01:14:52.820
a lot of those guards at the Louvre
might still be alive.

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:54.947
But that's irrelevant now.

01:15:02.623 --> 01:15:06.083
You're irrelevant now.

01:15:06.251 --> 01:15:08.169
Because tonight...

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:10.838
at the Castle da Vinci...

01:15:11.006 --> 01:15:12.381
we make gold!

01:15:12.549 --> 01:15:14.550
Rise and shine, sleepyheads.

01:15:14.718 --> 01:15:16.177
Ah, more babes for the party.

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:17.803
- Hi, Anna.
- Hi, Anna.

01:15:17.971 --> 01:15:21.140
Don't be stupid, Mr. Kaplan.
Give me the crystal.

01:15:21.308 --> 01:15:23.059
Anna Baragli...

01:15:23.227 --> 01:15:25.520
Came to play!

01:15:25.687 --> 01:15:27.647
Anna-banana-fo-fanna.

01:15:27.814 --> 01:15:30.024
You're not gonna shoot
little old me, are you?

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:32.109
You're not gonna
shoot little old anybody.

01:15:32.277 --> 01:15:34.111
- Pull the trigger. Shoot.
- Shoot, Anna.

01:15:34.279 --> 01:15:35.655
I read your dossier...

01:15:35.822 --> 01:15:38.199
- Sister.
- Pull the trigger!

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:42.995
Why did she call you Sister?

01:15:43.163 --> 01:15:45.331
I'm sorry, Hudson,
I meant to tell you.

01:15:45.499 --> 01:15:47.917
- He didn't know.
- He didn't know!

01:15:48.085 --> 01:15:49.126
Know what?

01:15:49.294 --> 01:15:51.379
Hawk likes a nun!

01:15:57.386 --> 01:15:59.637
Those better be tears
you're crying, Tommy.

01:15:59.805 --> 01:16:01.472
They are.

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:03.099
It doesn't mean I don't love you.

01:16:03.267 --> 01:16:06.060
Oh, no. You love me. It's your job!

01:16:06.228 --> 01:16:08.437
You probably love
Butterfingers over there.

01:16:08.605 --> 01:16:09.647
Well, yeah.

01:16:09.815 --> 01:16:12.984
In a weird sort of Catholic way, I do.

01:16:13.151 --> 01:16:15.236
But you...

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:17.446
You...

01:16:20.158 --> 01:16:23.911
Well, Miss Baragli's da Vinci expertise
allows her to go on to the next course.

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:27.123
- And as for you guys...
- Sorry, guys.

01:16:30.961 --> 01:16:33.504
A souvenir.

01:16:33.672 --> 01:16:35.298
Ciao.

01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:40.011
- Later, guys.
- Easy for you to say.

01:16:42.472 --> 01:16:44.432
Guys, we got some good news
and some bad news.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:47.435
The good news is you'll be completely
unparalyzed in about two minutes.

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:52.148
The bad news is that leaves you only
five seconds to defuse the bombs.

01:16:52.316 --> 01:16:53.858
- Bombs?
- Bombs?

01:16:59.615 --> 01:17:01.657
I'm so glad it had to be like this.

01:17:01.825 --> 01:17:04.285
I'll just shoot one in the kitchen
for good measure.

01:17:08.874 --> 01:17:10.916
Almond Joy! More paralysis!

01:17:13.879 --> 01:17:15.296
- You can move?
- Yeah.

01:17:17.966 --> 01:17:20.092
This is what I get
for darting a nun!

01:17:22.012 --> 01:17:23.763
Get this fucking thing off my head!

01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:28.267
- Tommy, look at Snickers.
- He's about to have a bad migraine.

01:17:28.435 --> 01:17:30.686
Maybe it was a dud.

01:17:47.162 --> 01:17:48.871
I don't know. It must be the curare.

01:17:49.039 --> 01:17:51.290
It's been known to have
certain side effects.

01:17:51.458 --> 01:17:54.126
Oh, really, George?

01:17:54.294 --> 01:17:58.130
I feel like a dolphin
who's never tasted melted snow.

01:17:58.298 --> 01:18:01.717
Listen, Anna. The apprentice's diary
contains a code...

01:18:01.885 --> 01:18:06.180
that explains how the three
pieces of crystal fit together.

01:18:06.348 --> 01:18:07.932
If you could do us the honor...

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:12.019
and decipher how the code works,
we would be eternally grateful.

01:18:12.187 --> 01:18:14.855
What does the color blue
taste like?

01:18:15.023 --> 01:18:17.191
Bobo knows.

01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:22.196
I must speak with the dolphins now.

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:31.038
Just shoot her. Anybody?

01:18:31.206 --> 01:18:34.792
Darwin, this is supposed to
be torture, not therapy.

01:18:35.585 --> 01:18:38.346
- Eddie, the old man said turn left at the fork.
- He said turn right.

01:18:38.422 --> 01:18:41.090
If you wanna save Anna,
you gotta find the castle first.

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:45.052
- Quit pushing.
- I'm not pushing.

01:18:49.182 --> 01:18:51.642
- Count of three?
- Why not just go now?

01:18:51.810 --> 01:18:54.019
- Okay. Hey, Tommy.
- What?

01:18:54.187 --> 01:18:56.272
- Who are you, Bob Hope for Texaco?
- What the hell are you talking about?

01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:58.232
- What are you doing with that golf bag?
- I got a plan.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.776
- Is it a great plan?
- A great big plan.

01:19:18.086 --> 01:19:20.629
- Tommy, let me ask you something.
- Go ahead.

01:19:20.797 --> 01:19:24.091
- How do I look?
- You look great. What, are you kidding?

01:19:24.259 --> 01:19:25.801
No. I want you to tell me.
Come on.

01:19:25.969 --> 01:19:27.261
I've been away a long time.

01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:29.555
Eddie, Eddie, we're hanging
off a castle in the middle of Italy...

01:19:29.723 --> 01:19:31.265
and you're asking me
how you look?

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:33.267
Okay, okay. You don't gotta get...

01:19:34.853 --> 01:19:35.895
You look gorgeous.

01:19:36.062 --> 01:19:38.189
- You look like fucking Zorro.
- Well, I didn't know.

01:19:38.982 --> 01:19:39.482
Hey!

01:19:47.157 --> 01:19:49.825
A lifetime of service
and it's come to this.

01:19:50.368 --> 01:19:52.578
The dolphin is dead.

01:19:52.746 --> 01:19:54.413
The dolphin is...

01:19:54.581 --> 01:19:57.124
Come on, you bitch!

01:19:57.292 --> 01:20:00.461
I'm not a very good damsel
in a dress, am I?

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:03.589
"You must pay the rent!"
"But I can't pay the rent."

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:07.259
Yo, Flipper.

01:20:07.427 --> 01:20:11.305
A damsel in distress implies that there
is some well-hung Dudley Do-Right...

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:13.307
galloping up to save you.

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:14.767
It ain't gonna happen.

01:20:14.935 --> 01:20:18.437
Hudson Hawk go boom-boom.
He dead.

01:20:28.031 --> 01:20:31.867
- I'm thinking of using the 7 iron.
- Looks long, junior.

01:20:32.035 --> 01:20:33.619
- Six iron?
- Bingo.

01:20:33.787 --> 01:20:36.372
Thank you. Fore!

01:20:37.874 --> 01:20:40.084
"Fore"?

01:20:40.252 --> 01:20:41.418
Did anybody hear something?

01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:45.798
Can you fucking believe...?

01:20:45.966 --> 01:20:47.842
I heard something.

01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:51.762
- Did you set the timer on that thing?
- No.

01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:53.889
From now on, please set the timer.

01:20:54.474 --> 01:20:57.810
- Come on, Butterfinger.
- I think it's time for Plan C, darling.

01:20:57.978 --> 01:21:00.187
Kit Kat, you guard
the Mayflowers with your life.

01:21:06.111 --> 01:21:09.071
Oh, Kit Kat. Are you really
going to guard us with your life?

01:21:10.198 --> 01:21:11.782
Kit Kat!

01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:21.709
A double crossbow
for a double-cross.

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:25.045
Oh, Alfie, you dry British madman.

01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:27.172
- Thank you.
- Catch you later, baby.

01:21:32.846 --> 01:21:35.723
- Why did you that?
- Try this one, Sister.

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:38.559
Thou shalt not share.

01:21:39.769 --> 01:21:42.062
It's in the hole!
The gallery's ecstatic!

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:43.564
Oh, he's gotta be happy
with that one, Tommy.

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:44.773
So what do you say, Eddie?

01:21:44.941 --> 01:21:48.021
Two and half minutes to save Anna,
three and a half minutes to save the world?

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:50.779

Maybe we'd better go this way.

01:22:21.144 --> 01:22:24.021
Okay. This way.

01:22:24.189 --> 01:22:26.857
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.
We'd better split up.

01:22:27.025 --> 01:22:30.235
I'll take the front nine, you take the back nine.
And we'll meet back at the clubhouse.

01:22:30.403 --> 01:22:31.612
- Hey, Tommy.

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:33.322

Hey, coach. Looks bad.

01:23:40.724 --> 01:23:43.350
I think those Mayflowers
set us up.

01:23:48.898 --> 01:23:51.525
Jumbo, we hardly knew you.

01:23:55.155 --> 01:23:57.322
Since you're not gonna tell us
what we want to know...

01:23:57.490 --> 01:24:02.161
then I think it's time for you to report
to the head office in heaven, Sis.

01:24:02.328 --> 01:24:06.206
If you see the big guy,
tell him he's a loser.

01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:07.833
That's it.

01:24:20.138 --> 01:24:22.056
- That didn't hurt.
- No?

01:24:22.223 --> 01:24:23.891
Try this.

01:24:33.443 --> 01:24:36.737
What do you say now,
you centrally intelligent scumsicle?

01:24:41.534 --> 01:24:42.951
Getting old, George?

01:24:51.252 --> 01:24:56.090
Tommy, you New York-Italian-father-
made-20-bucks-a-week son of a bitch!

01:24:56.257 --> 01:24:57.758
You were hired as bait...

01:24:57.926 --> 01:25:00.969
and on this simple task,
you have betrayed me.

01:25:01.137 --> 01:25:04.181
- Do you have an answer why?
- I got five of them.

01:25:05.892 --> 01:25:08.352
One! Two!

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.813
Three! Four!

01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:13.690
Just one more. Five!

01:25:21.991 --> 01:25:23.742
That didn't... Hurt.

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:31.792
How do I stop this?

01:25:34.712 --> 01:25:36.046
My hat.

01:25:43.388 --> 01:25:46.014
I guess you never fucked
with nobody from Hoboken before.

01:25:46.182 --> 01:25:48.142
- Hudson!
- Anna...

01:25:48.309 --> 01:25:50.227
we're supposed
to be saving you.

01:25:50.395 --> 01:25:52.771
I'm sorry.
I got bored, so I saved myself.

01:25:52.939 --> 01:25:54.606
We still gotta get
them crystal pieces, don't we?

01:25:54.774 --> 01:25:56.066
Got them right here, cowboy.

01:25:56.234 --> 01:25:57.734
"Got them right here, cowboy."

01:25:57.902 --> 01:26:00.070
- Eddie!
- Sounds like Tommy.

01:26:02.073 --> 01:26:03.490
Tommy!

01:26:03.658 --> 01:26:06.618
Alfred, I won't be needing
the car anymore.

01:26:08.913 --> 01:26:10.205
Ta-ta!

01:26:14.335 --> 01:26:15.544
Tommy!

01:26:18.673 --> 01:26:19.173
Eddie!

01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:26.680
My pension!

01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:41.778
- Friend of yours?
- Dead!

01:26:55.210 --> 01:26:56.919
Hudson, look...

01:26:57.086 --> 01:26:58.253
Out.

01:27:14.771 --> 01:27:17.606
- Minerva.
- Anna! Hawkmeister!

01:27:17.774 --> 01:27:21.276
You're probably wondering
why you're still alive.

01:27:21.444 --> 01:27:25.113
We're still having a little problem
putting this damn crystal together.

01:27:25.281 --> 01:27:28.575
Alfie and I have
been at it all night.

01:27:28.743 --> 01:27:31.411
Well? What are you waiting for?

01:27:40.922 --> 01:27:44.716
- Don't do it, Hudson.
- Relax.

01:27:44.884 --> 01:27:49.012
Besides, we don't
have much choice, do we?

01:28:15.623 --> 01:28:20.335
Oh, Hawk, don't ever change.

01:28:23.214 --> 01:28:27.551
Nice Hawk.

01:28:29.178 --> 01:28:30.804
Bad Hawk!

01:28:41.441 --> 01:28:45.402
Why is the world jam-packed
with such idiots?

01:28:45.903 --> 01:28:50.574
Every schmo has the fantasy that
the planet revolves around them.

01:28:50.742 --> 01:28:53.535
It rains. A car crash stops traffic.

01:28:53.703 --> 01:28:56.079
You say, "How can
this happen to me?"

01:28:56.247 --> 01:29:00.417
But for us, this isn't a fantasy.

01:29:00.585 --> 01:29:02.336
It is a reality.

01:29:02.503 --> 01:29:05.464
Oh, yes. If da Vinci
was alive today...

01:29:05.631 --> 01:29:07.966
he'd be eating
microwave sushi, naked...

01:29:08.134 --> 01:29:10.969
in the back of a Cadillac
with the both of us.

01:29:11.137 --> 01:29:12.971
The project of his life...

01:29:13.139 --> 01:29:15.849
is now the toy of mine.

01:29:16.017 --> 01:29:20.771
History, tradition, culture
are not concepts.

01:29:20.938 --> 01:29:24.858
These are trophies I keep in my den
as paperweights.

01:29:25.026 --> 01:29:28.153
The chaos we will cause the world
with this machine...

01:29:28.321 --> 01:29:31.740
will be our final masterpiece.

01:29:31.908 --> 01:29:32.792
Go, team, go!

01:29:41.292 --> 01:29:42.459
Yes!

01:29:53.012 --> 01:29:54.221
Now!

01:30:07.693 --> 01:30:10.862
Eureka, motherfucker!

01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:14.116
Well, you should feel very good
about yourself.

01:30:14.283 --> 01:30:16.368
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

01:30:16.536 --> 01:30:19.297
What would happen if I didn't put
that crystal together exactly right?

01:30:19.414 --> 01:30:20.455
What do you mean?

01:30:20.623 --> 01:30:24.084
Well, let's just say, for example,
I left out...

01:30:24.252 --> 01:30:26.461
this little piece of mirror here.

01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:30.549
- Would that be bad?
- Real bad.

01:30:30.716 --> 01:30:31.883
Good.

01:30:41.227 --> 01:30:43.895
Minerva! Minerva!

01:30:47.692 --> 01:30:49.526
Alfred!

01:31:07.211 --> 01:31:09.087
- Your turn.
- My turn?

01:31:09.255 --> 01:31:12.215
How'd it get to be my turn?
I just killed Darwin and Minerva!

01:31:13.509 --> 01:31:15.677
- Definitely your turn.
- Shit.

01:31:16.971 --> 01:31:19.931
All right. Just stay over here
and try to stay out of the way, alright?

01:31:20.099 --> 01:31:21.933
- Hudson.
- What?

01:31:29.775 --> 01:31:31.359
Okay.

01:31:45.166 --> 01:31:47.250
Thou shalt not kill!
Thou shalt not kill!

01:31:47.418 --> 01:31:48.668
Sorry!

01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:02.349
Stop helping me!

01:32:09.106 --> 01:32:10.565
Hey, Alfred...

01:32:13.778 --> 01:32:16.530
you won't be attending
that hat convention in July.

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:25.413
- My turn?
- Yeah.

01:32:28.793 --> 01:32:30.669
With this dog, now?

01:32:34.173 --> 01:32:35.590
Oh, Bunny.

01:32:37.093 --> 01:32:39.010
Ball-ball.

01:32:43.474 --> 01:32:45.600
Come on, puppy chow, gotta go.

01:33:01.534 --> 01:33:03.827
Here we go.

01:33:03.995 --> 01:33:05.495
Move your hand! Take it away!

01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:23.555
Just hang on.

01:33:36.902 --> 01:33:38.486
Oh, Leonardo.

01:33:40.114 --> 01:33:42.490
Go, Leonardo!

01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:48.747
Oh, baby!

01:33:50.166 --> 01:33:51.708
Hi, kids.

01:34:03.387 --> 01:34:06.431
- Anna?
- Yes, Hudson?

01:34:06.599 --> 01:34:07.891
Can I ask you something?

01:34:08.059 --> 01:34:10.602
Sure.

01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:13.855
Will you play Nintendo with me?

01:34:14.273 --> 01:34:18.193
I can't think of anybody
I'd rather play Nintendo with.

01:34:28.537 --> 01:34:30.121
Wait a minute.

01:34:30.289 --> 01:34:32.248
- What about your boss?
- What boss?

01:34:32.416 --> 01:34:34.000
You know.

01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:36.586
Oh, I think he wants me
to keep an eye on you.

01:34:36.754 --> 01:34:39.673
You know, I think he wants you
to keep an eye on me too.

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:42.175
Because I got criminal tendencies.

01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:44.719
- Can I buy you a cappuccino?
- Yes.

01:34:44.887 --> 01:34:47.389
- Can I give you a kiss?
- Yes.

01:34:49.475 --> 01:34:51.893
I just wish Tommy were here.

01:34:52.978 --> 01:34:54.521
No way.

01:34:54.689 --> 01:34:55.897
That's not very nice.

01:34:56.065 --> 01:34:57.399
No way!

01:34:57.566 --> 01:34:59.401
Yes way!

01:35:02.363 --> 01:35:04.364
Did I miss anything?

01:35:04.532 --> 01:35:05.615
Did you miss anything?

01:35:05.783 --> 01:35:07.742
You're supposed to be all crashed up
at the bottom of the hill.

01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:10.578
Air bags.
Can you fucking believe it?

01:35:10.746 --> 01:35:13.027
You're supposed to be blown up
into fiery chunks of flesh.

01:35:13.165 --> 01:35:15.166
Sprinkler system
set up in the back.

01:35:15.334 --> 01:35:18.837
Can you fucking believe it?!

01:35:19.004 --> 01:35:21.172
Yeah, that's probably
what happened.

01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:23.133
Drink your cappuccino.

01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:26.511
Hey. Drink your coffee.

01:35:37.106 --> 01:35:41.860
With the world saved and
the secrets of da Vinci protected...

01:35:42.027 --> 01:35:44.821
