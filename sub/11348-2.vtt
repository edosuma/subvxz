IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:09.810 --> 00:12.246
SEXUALLY-BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:12.280 --> 00:15.349
IN NEW YORK CITY, THE DEDICATED
DETECTIVES WHO INVESTIGATE

00:15.383 --> 00:17.818
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES ARE
MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:17.851 --> 00:20.288
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:20.321 --> 00:22.456
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.334
- WITH US TODAY,

00:33.367 --> 00:36.737
THE GREATEST
BASKETBALL PLAYER EVER.

00:36.770 --> 00:39.173
HE RETIRED THREE YEARS AGO,

00:39.207 --> 00:44.178
AND HIS LEGACY HAS ONLY GROWN
IN HIS ABSENCE.

00:44.212 --> 00:46.314
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

00:46.347 --> 00:49.217
THE ONE AND THE ONLY,

00:49.250 --> 00:51.685
SHAKIR "THE SHARK" WILKINS.

00:51.719 --> 00:54.355
[cheers and applause]

01:03.264 --> 01:04.798
- AS MY DAUGHTER MENTIONED,

01:04.832 --> 01:07.568
TODAY'S A VERY SPECIAL DAY
AT ORION BAY.

01:07.601 --> 01:10.538
TODAY WE ARE ANNOUNCING
THE WORST-KEPT SECRET

01:10.571 --> 01:12.173
IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY:

01:12.206 --> 01:15.243
SHAKIR'S CONTRACT
HAS BEEN RENEWED.

01:15.276 --> 01:16.844
[cheers and applause]

01:16.877 --> 01:19.247
- HE'S NOT ONLY A GREAT WARRIOR,

01:19.280 --> 01:21.549
HE'S AN EVEN GREATER ROLE MODEL.

01:21.582 --> 01:24.852
AND HE WILL ALWAYS BE A PART
OF OUR ORION BAY FAMILY.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.354
[cheers and applause]

01:26.387 --> 01:27.421
- SHAKIR.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.894
- THANK YOU, MR. BAUER.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.665
IT'S AN HONOR, A PRIVILEGE,

01:37.698 --> 01:40.501
AND ONE HELL OF A PAYDAY.
[chuckles]

01:40.534 --> 01:42.370
- [female TV host]
WE'LL TAKE QUESTIONS NOW,

01:42.403 --> 01:43.904
WE'LL START WITH AL TRAUTWIG.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.339
- WHAT'S UP?
- HEY.

01:45.373 --> 01:47.175
SHAKIR LOOKS...

01:47.208 --> 01:48.876
GOOD.
- RIGHT.

01:48.909 --> 01:51.345
MOST OF THOSE GUYS GET A LITTLE
CHUBBY AFTER THEY RETIRE.

01:51.379 --> 01:53.181
- I SWEAR I DIDN'T HAVE
A GAMBLING PROBLEM

01:53.214 --> 01:54.515
TILL HE LEFT THE GAME.

01:54.548 --> 01:57.285
I NEVER LOST A DOLLAR
BETTING ON HIM.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.488
- THAT'S MY BOY.

02:00.521 --> 02:03.624
NICE JOB.
- THANK YOU, SIR.

02:03.657 --> 02:07.228
- WELL, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHERE IS IT?

02:07.261 --> 02:10.164
- WHAT'S GOING ON, HONEY?
- SHAKIR'S DRIVER'S GONE AWOL.

02:10.198 --> 02:12.366
- WELL, UBER IT.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.334
CARLA CAN GO WITH.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.503
- UM, CAN'T SOMEONE ELSE
DO THAT?

02:15.536 --> 02:17.305
- IS THERE A PROBLEM?

02:17.338 --> 02:18.572
- SHAKIR.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.408
CARLA WILL GET YOU OUT OF HERE,
LET'S GO.

02:20.441 --> 02:22.243
HI, YES...

02:40.861 --> 02:43.264
- NO!
GET OFF OF ME!

02:43.297 --> 02:44.965
YOU CAN'T SHUT ME UP!

02:44.998 --> 02:47.901
I'M NOT YOUR THOT, YOU CAN'T
JUST MAKE THIS GO AWAY!

02:47.935 --> 02:50.271
HE KNOWS WHAT HE DID!
- CARLA, THAT'S ENOUGH!

02:50.304 --> 02:51.639
- YOUR LIFE JUST GETS
TO GO ON, HUH?

02:51.672 --> 02:53.441
MORE MONEY, MORE FAME,

02:53.474 --> 02:54.675
NO RESPONSIBILITY!
- GET HER OUT OF HERE,

02:54.708 --> 02:56.510
GET HER OUT OF HERE!
- GET OFF OF ME!

02:56.544 --> 02:58.279
- THE HELL IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?
- DAD, LET'S GO.

02:58.312 --> 02:59.747
LET'S GO, PLEASE.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.382
- YOU CAN'T SHUT ME UP!

03:01.415 --> 03:05.219
I'M NOT YOUR THOT--
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

03:05.253 --> 03:07.355
- UH, BREAKING NEWS
AT ORION BAY.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.789
YOU KNOW SHAKIR WILKINS?

03:08.822 --> 03:10.724
- UH, AMERICA'S HERO?
YEAH.

03:10.758 --> 03:13.227
- NOT ANYMORE.

03:13.261 --> 03:14.628
- GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME!

03:14.662 --> 03:16.830
HE'S NOT A ROLE MODEL,
HE'S A RAPIST!

03:16.864 --> 03:18.366
HE RAPED ME!

03:18.399 --> 03:19.667
- WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

03:19.700 --> 03:21.402
HALF HOUR AGO.
WANT ME TO TALK TO THIS GIRL?

03:21.435 --> 03:22.503
- WHERE ARE FIN AND ROLLINS?

03:22.536 --> 03:23.571
- AT A WORKING LUNCH.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.406
- GET 'EM BACK IN HERE.

03:31.512 --> 03:34.482
[dramatic music]

03:34.515 --> 03:42.523
*

03:45.793 --> 03:53.801
*

03:57.004 --> 04:05.279
*

04:19.026 --> 04:19.427
.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.060
- DO I HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THIS?

04:21.662 --> 04:22.996
- WELL, WE HAVE A VIDEO OF YOU
ATTACKING SHAKIR,

04:23.030 --> 04:25.899
SO IF HE PRESSES CHARGES,
THIS MIGHT HELP.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.636
- IF HE PRESSES CHARGES?
HE ASSAULTED ME.

04:28.669 --> 04:31.038
- IT DIDN'T LOOK THAT WAY
ON THE TAPE.

04:31.071 --> 04:33.807
- SHE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT TODAY.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.609
ARE YOU, CARLA?

04:35.643 --> 04:37.378
- NO.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.949
I'M TALKING ABOUT MEMORIAL DAY.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.050
- THREE MONTHS AGO?

04:44.852 --> 04:46.787
- CARLA, WHY DON'T YOU
HAVE A SEAT?

04:51.959 --> 04:55.696
- A SUMMER KICK-OFF
IN THE HAMPTONS.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.331
I DROVE SHAKIR BACK TO THE CITY

04:57.365 --> 04:59.833
AND HE INVITED ME TO HIS HOTEL
FOR A NIGHTCAP.

04:59.867 --> 05:03.537
- AT THE BAR,
OR DID YOU GO TO HIS ROOM?

05:03.571 --> 05:05.706
- THE LAST THING I REMEMBER...

05:05.739 --> 05:09.377
WAS HAVING A DRINK WITH HIM
AT THE HOTEL BAR.

05:09.410 --> 05:12.346
ONE DRINK.

05:12.380 --> 05:14.448
I WOKE UP IN HIS ROOM.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.117
IN HIS BED,
NAKED AND SORE.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.119
- DID YOU GO TO THE HOSPITAL
AFTERWARDS,

05:19.152 --> 05:22.956
OR CALL A DOCTOR?

05:22.990 --> 05:24.658
- NO.

05:24.692 --> 05:28.362
WHAT WAS I GONNA DO?
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

05:28.396 --> 05:31.532
- WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE
TO CONFRONT HIM TODAY,

05:31.565 --> 05:33.066
AT A PRESS EVENT?

05:33.100 --> 05:34.635
- THERE WAS A PROBLEM
WITH HIS CAR,

05:34.668 --> 05:38.539
AND SO I WAS TOLD TO GET SHAKIR
BACK TO HIS HOTEL.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.574
IT TRIGGERED ME.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.677
LOOK, THIS IS A MISTAKE, OKAY?

05:43.711 --> 05:45.112
THERE'S NOTHING THAT YOU GUYS
CAN DO ABOUT IT,

05:45.145 --> 05:46.747
AND I'M PROBABLY GONNA LOSE
MY JOB AS IT IS--

05:46.780 --> 05:48.882
- HOLD ON, HOLD ON, ONE SEC.

05:48.916 --> 05:51.051
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT,
"LOSE YOUR JOB"?

05:51.084 --> 05:52.486
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

05:52.520 --> 05:54.988
SHAKIR WILKINS IS
THE FACE OF ORION BAY.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.925
IT'S LIKE PEEING
ON MOUNT RUSHMORE.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.560
I MEAN, MR. BAUER SAID IT
BACK THEN:

05:59.593 --> 06:01.762
"NO GOOD CAN COME FROM THIS."

06:01.795 --> 06:05.065
- YOU TOLD MR. BAUER
ABOUT THE RAPE?

06:05.098 --> 06:08.101
- YES, HE SAID THAT
MAYBE I WAS CONFUSED,

06:08.135 --> 06:10.538
OR THAT...MY FEELINGS WERE HURT

06:10.571 --> 06:12.940
BECAUSE SHAKIR DIDN'T
SEND FLOWERS.

06:12.973 --> 06:17.445
MR. BAUER SAID THAT IF I KEPT
THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN US,

06:17.478 --> 06:20.448
HE'D RECOMMEND A BONUS
EVERY TIME THAT MY NAME CAME UP.

06:20.481 --> 06:25.653
- AND CARLA, CAN YOU...
PROVE THAT?

06:25.686 --> 06:29.490
- LAST WEEK I GOT $5,000.

06:32.793 --> 06:35.663
- THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT.

06:35.696 --> 06:38.165
GIRLS THROW THEMSELVES AT SHAKIR
ALL THE TIME.

06:38.198 --> 06:39.800
WHY WOULD HE NEED
TO RAPE SOMEBODY?

06:39.833 --> 06:41.635
- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN,
BUT ISN'T IT POSSIBLE

06:41.669 --> 06:43.604
YOU WERE ALSO TRYING
TO PROTECT YOUR COMPANY'S IMAGE?

06:43.637 --> 06:45.639
- MY FATHER VOLUNTEERED
TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

06:45.673 --> 06:48.742
- WE ACTUALLY PREFER
TO SPEAK TO WITNESSES

06:48.776 --> 06:50.611
WITHOUT FAMILY MEMBERS PRESENT.

06:50.644 --> 06:54.147
- CORDELIA IS NOT JUST MY VP,
SHE'S ALSO MY LAWYER,

06:54.181 --> 06:55.716
SO SHE STAYS.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.719
- WANT TO TELL US ABOUT
THE BONUS YOU GAVE CARLA?

06:58.752 --> 07:00.554
- THERE WERE NO PAYMENTS
OF ANY KIND.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.956
- AND WHAT ABOUT
THE EXTRA $5,000 LAST WEEK?

07:02.990 --> 07:04.525
WAS THAT
A PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE?

07:04.558 --> 07:08.862
- ORION BAY IS A FAMILY.
WE TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.531
WHEN SHE CAME TO ME,

07:10.564 --> 07:13.100
SHE SAID THAT SHE DID NOT
REMEMBER ALL THE DETAILS.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.202
BUT SHE'S A GOOD KID.

07:15.235 --> 07:17.170
MAYBE SHE GOT A LITTLE DRUNK.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.106
I DIDN'T WANT ANY HARD FEELINGS.

07:19.139 --> 07:22.209
- THE PROBLEM IS, IT LOOKS
LIKE YOU'RE COVERING UP A RAPE.

07:22.242 --> 07:23.844
- MY FATHER IS BLAMELESS HERE.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.980
AN UNSTABLE EMPLOYEE MADE
UNSUPPORTED ALLEGATIONS.

07:27.014 --> 07:28.516
IF SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS RAPED,

07:28.549 --> 07:29.983
WHY DIDN'T SHE REPORT THAT
TO THE POLICE?

07:30.017 --> 07:31.184
- SHE HAS NOW.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.689
- SHAKIR IS LIKE A SON TO ME.

07:35.723 --> 07:39.026
HE WOULD NOT DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.828
LET ME TALK TO THE BOY,
I'LL SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.229
- DON'T DO THAT.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.197
IT'S AN OFFICIAL
POLICE INVESTIGATION,

07:44.231 --> 07:47.200
SO ANY CONVERSATION YOU HAVE
WITH SHAKIR, EITHER OF YOU,

07:47.234 --> 07:50.070
COULD BE MISCONSTRUED
AS CONSPIRACY.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.907
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO, LET'S GO!
SNAP THAT WRIST, C'MON!

07:53.941 --> 07:56.209
LET'S SEE THAT CROSSOVER,
WHADDYA GOT, WHADDYA GOT? C'MON!

07:56.243 --> 07:58.211
THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO!

07:58.245 --> 08:00.247
NEXT TIME, NEXT TIME, LET'S GO,
KEEP IT GOING.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.083
WHADDYA GOT, WHADDYA GOT,
WHADDYA GOT?

08:03.116 --> 08:04.852
THERE YOU GO, GOOD JOB,
GOOD JOB!

08:04.885 --> 08:06.954
- HEY, SHAKIR!
CAN WE TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE?

08:09.557 --> 08:10.858
- ALL RIGHT, KEEP IT GOING,
GUYS, KEEP IT GOING,

08:10.891 --> 08:12.225
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

08:12.259 --> 08:15.796
- WE JUST NEED TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.064
- WHAT'S THIS ABOUT, CARLA?

08:17.097 --> 08:18.732
LOOK, SHE OBVIOUSLY HAS
EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS

08:18.766 --> 08:20.568
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO PRESS ANY CHARGES.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.102
- THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

08:22.135 --> 08:27.541
- SHE'S ACCUSING YOU OF RAPE,
MR. WILKINS.

08:27.575 --> 08:30.277
- LOOK, LIKE I SAID,
SHE HAS EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS,

08:30.310 --> 08:32.112
AND I HOPE SHE GETS
THE HELP SHE NEEDS.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.614
- HMM.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.182
AND HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN HER?

08:35.215 --> 08:36.984
- GIRLS LIKE THAT, THEY COME
AND GO WITH THE COMPANY.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.218
WHAT, MAYBE A YEAR?

08:38.251 --> 08:40.120
- BUT YOU SPENT MEMORIAL DAY
WITH HER, RIGHT?

08:40.153 --> 08:43.791
AND SHE DROVE YOU BACK
TO YOUR HOTEL?

08:43.824 --> 08:46.560
- YEAH, YEAH, UH...
MY TOWN CAR OVERHEATED,

08:46.594 --> 08:48.596
AND SHE DROVE ME BACK
INTO THE CITY.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.931
- TO YOUR HOTEL.
DID ANYTHING HAPPEN?

08:50.964 --> 08:54.034
- WE HAD A DRINK AT THE BAR,
A BITE TO EAT, THEN SHE LEFT.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.102
- AND THAT'S IT.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.203
- YEAH.

08:56.236 --> 08:58.038
- BECAUSE, UM...

08:58.071 --> 08:59.272
SHE SAYS YOU DRUGGED HER, YOU
TOOK HER BACK UP TO YOUR ROOM,

08:59.306 --> 09:01.809
AND YOU RAPED HER.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.176
- THAT'S INSANE.
THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.978
- THEN WHY WOULD SHE SAY IT DID?

09:05.012 --> 09:06.079
- BUT...THIS...

09:06.113 --> 09:07.314
THIS IS NOTHING BUT A SHAKEDOWN.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.849
- SHE CAME AT YOU FOR MONEY?

09:08.882 --> 09:10.984
- NO...BUT SHE WILL.

09:11.018 --> 09:13.186
I'M GOING THROUGH A DIVORCE
RIGHT NOW--A CUSTODY BATTLE.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.822
IT'S IN THE PAPERS.
SHE KNOWS ABOUT IT.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.624
- YEAH, WE GET THAT.

09:16.657 --> 09:20.193
- LOOK, I FEEL BADLY
FOR THIS GIRL.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.162
I'M TRYING
NOT TO OVERREACT HERE,

09:22.195 --> 09:24.264
BUT IF ANYONE WAS ASSAULTED IT
WAS ME, IN THAT ELEVATOR.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.033
- YOU WANT TO PRESS CHARGES,
THEN?

09:30.203 --> 09:32.072
- YEAH, MAYBE I SHOULD TALK TO
MY LAWYER AT THIS POINT,

09:32.105 --> 09:33.974
TO PROTECT MYSELF, OKAY?

09:34.007 --> 09:36.076
IN THE MEANTIME I HAVE
TO GET BACK TO THESE KIDS.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.979
- SHAKIR, HOW LONG
YOU GONNA BE IN TOWN?

09:39.012 --> 09:41.114
- FEW MORE EVENTS,
JUST FOR THE WEEK.

09:41.148 --> 09:45.218
- 'CAUSE IF YOU LEAVE, YOU NEED
TO TELL US WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.094
- LOOK, SOMETHING SET CARLA OFF.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.029
- IT HAPPENED THREE MONTHS AGO.

09:56.063 --> 09:58.098
BUT SHE WAITS UNTIL ALL
THE HOTEL VIDEO'S BEEN ERASED

09:58.131 --> 10:00.067
AND SHE'S GOT
A LOBBY FULL OF PRESS?

10:00.100 --> 10:02.269
- PUTTING ON A SHOW
FOR THE SECURITY CAMERAS.

10:02.302 --> 10:05.072
SHAKIR THINKS IT'S A SHAKEDOWN.
HE'S GOING THROUGH A DIVORCE.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.907
- COME ON, GUYS, I DON'T WANT TO
HEAR THAT WOMEN LIE,

10:06.940 --> 10:08.408
AND THAT SHAKIR IS A HERO

10:08.441 --> 10:10.177
AND HE NEVER COULD HAVE DONE
SUCH A THING.

10:10.210 --> 10:13.180
THIS IS SVU, AND WE
TAKE DISCLOSURES SERIOUSLY.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.882
- COPY THAT, SERGEANT, BUT...

10:14.915 --> 10:16.684
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH?

10:16.717 --> 10:19.052
SHAKIR'S BEEN A PUBLIC FIGURE
FOR WHAT, 20 YEARS?

10:19.086 --> 10:21.188
THERE'S NEVER BEEN A WHISPER
ABOUT ANYTHING LIKE THIS,

10:21.221 --> 10:22.723
THIS IS JUST LIKE
COMING OUT OF NOWHERE.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.825
- AND, THIS GIRL CAN'T REMEMBER
ANY DETAILS.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.093
- EXACTLY.
- GUYS...

10:26.126 --> 10:29.362
WE'VE HAD CASES
WHERE ATHLETES DRUG WOMEN.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.231
RAWLINS, ARE YOU WITH US?

10:31.264 --> 10:35.035
- UH...YEAH...IT'S...
MY OLD CAPTAIN IN ATLANTA.

10:35.068 --> 10:39.239
A GIRL DOWN THERE CLAIMS THAT
SHAKIR DID THE SAME THING TO HER

10:39.272 --> 10:40.440
AFTER SEEING HIM ON THE NEWS.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.209
- AH.
THEY'RE PILING ON NOW, HUH?

10:42.242 --> 10:45.746
- OKAY, SO, GO GET ON A PLANE
AND TALK TO THE GIRL.

10:45.779 --> 10:49.116
AND, UH, DON'T LET
YOUR HERO WORSHIP BLIND YOU.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.984
- WILL DO.

10:51.018 --> 10:54.087
MAYBE I'LL CHECK IN
ON MY MOM WHILE I'M THERE.

10:56.957 --> 10:59.226
- SO YOU GONNA SEE MOM
WHILE YOU'RE HERE?

10:59.259 --> 11:01.194
- NO...
I DON'T KNOW.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.764
TELL ME ABOUT THIS VICTIM.

11:03.797 --> 11:06.033
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW
THAT SHE IS ONE.

11:06.066 --> 11:09.236
SHE CLAIMS SHAKIR WILKINS
RAPED HER OVER SIX MONTHS AGO.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.772
NO OUTCRY, NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.

11:11.805 --> 11:14.708
WE'RE NOT PURSUING.
- OKAY, SO...

11:14.742 --> 11:16.243
WHY'D YOU CALL ME?

11:16.276 --> 11:19.079
- THOUGHT YOU'D WANT TO KNOW.

11:19.112 --> 11:23.150
MAYBE I...JUST WANTED
AN EXCUSE.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.352
- YOU AND YOUR WIFE SEPARATED?
AGAIN?

11:25.385 --> 11:26.787
- THIS TIME IT'S FOR GOOD.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.956
LITTLE GIRL'S IN COLLEGE, SO...

11:28.989 --> 11:30.223
YOU UP FOR A BEER LATER?

11:30.257 --> 11:31.825
- I GOTTA TAKE A RAIN CHECK
ON THAT.

11:31.859 --> 11:34.795
I GOTTA CATCH THE 5:00 TODAY,
BACK TO NEW YORK.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.129
THEY WORK YOU HARD UP THERE.

11:36.163 --> 11:38.766
- OH.
NEXT TIME.

11:38.799 --> 11:41.101
- HEY, IS THE DEPUTY CHIEF IN?

11:41.134 --> 11:42.803
- YOU JUST MISSED HIM.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.938
HE SAID HE KNEW YOU WERE COMING
AND HE SENDS HIS REGARDS.

11:44.972 --> 11:47.908
- HMM.

11:47.941 --> 11:51.111
- I WAS SHAKIR'S STYLIST
ON A SHOOT.

11:51.144 --> 11:54.147
I WAS THRILLED TO MEET HIM...

11:54.181 --> 11:56.183
AT FIRST.

11:56.216 --> 12:01.288
- TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED,
MACIE-LYNN.

12:01.321 --> 12:04.825
- HE INVITED ME
TO HIS HOTEL AFTER.

12:05.859 --> 12:09.897
WE HAD SOME WINE.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.835
THE NEXT THING I REMEMBER...

12:14.868 --> 12:16.970
I WAS IN HIS BED,

12:18.305 --> 12:21.208
NAKED.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.513
HE RAPED ME,
JUST LIKE THAT OTHER GIRL SAID.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.181
- DID YOU TELL ANYONE?

12:28.215 --> 12:29.850
- NO.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.985
ATLANTA'S A SMALL TOWN,
PEOPLE TALK.

12:32.019 --> 12:34.788
- YEAH...THEY DO.

12:34.822 --> 12:39.026
- SO, I, UM...
I CALLED MR. BAUER.

12:39.059 --> 12:41.261
I'D MET HIM
AT SOME EVENTS DOWN HERE.

12:41.294 --> 12:44.865
HE TOLD ME THE SAME THING
THAT CAPTAIN OUT THERE SAID,

12:44.898 --> 12:49.269
THAT NO GOOD WILL COME
FROM MAKING A COMPLAINT.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.271
- UM...

12:51.304 --> 12:56.009
DID MR. BAUER OFFER
ANY KIND OF OTHER HELP AT ALL?

12:58.178 --> 13:00.280
- HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT
HARD FEELINGS,

13:00.313 --> 13:05.552
SO IF I COULD LET IT GO,
HE'D SEE TO IT I GOT A BONUS.

13:07.888 --> 13:11.859
I SUPPORT MY FAMILY,
MY DADDY LOST HIS JOB...

13:11.892 --> 13:15.128
I NEEDED THE MONEY.

13:17.397 --> 13:21.168
- SO I GAVE THIS MARCIE GIRL
FIVE GRAND.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.336
SHE HAD NO MEMORY
OF WHAT HAPPENED.

13:23.370 --> 13:26.206
IT WAS THE SAME COCKAMAMIE STORY
CARLA TOLD.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.541
- BUT...YOU HADN'T HEARD
CARLA'S STORY YET,

13:28.575 --> 13:32.412
AND MACIE-LYNN
WAS SIX MONTHS AGO.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.381
- WELL, I MAY HAVE
THE TIMELINE CONFUSED--

13:34.414 --> 13:36.349
- MY FATHER RUNS
A MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY

13:36.383 --> 13:39.286
FIELDING HUNDREDS OF EMAILS
AND PHONE CALLS A DAY.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.955
YOU CAN'T EXPECT HIM TO REMEMBER
WHO SAID WHAT WHEN.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.891
- YEAH. BUT YOU'D REMEMBER

13:43.924 --> 13:46.193
IF SOMEBODY ELSE CAME TO YOU
ABOUT SHAKIR, RIGHT?

13:46.226 --> 13:48.295
- HOW'S THAT?
- MR. BAUER?

13:48.328 --> 13:50.563
YOU'RE LOOKING AT
WITNESS BRIBERY.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.099
THINK HARD.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.934
- OKAY, ACTUALLY,
WE ARE DONE HERE.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.535
DAD?
- NO, NO, NO.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.206
THERE WAS A GOLD DIGGER,

13:59.239 --> 14:00.473
A BLACK GIRL...

14:00.507 --> 14:03.010
WORKS IN RETAIL.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.979
I DIDN'T BELIEVE
A WORD SHE SAID.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.150
- HEY, YOU'RE TIANA?

14:10.183 --> 14:15.288
WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SHAKIR.

14:15.322 --> 14:17.891
- THIS ABOUT THAT GIRL WHO
WENT OFF ON HIM IN THE ELEVATOR?

14:17.925 --> 14:19.626
- MM-HMM.

14:23.463 --> 14:26.466
- I LIKE WORKING HERE.
I DON'T WANT NO PART OF THIS.

14:26.499 --> 14:27.935
- SO YOU THINK IF YOU TALK
TO THE POLICE,

14:27.968 --> 14:30.037
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE YOUR JOB?

14:30.070 --> 14:33.206
- MR. BAUER SAID SHAKIR
IS THE GOLDEN GOOSE,

14:33.240 --> 14:35.943
ROLE MODEL FOR MY COMMUNITY.

14:35.976 --> 14:39.679
LOOK AROUND, WE ALL HAVE
OUR JOBS BECAUSE OF SHAKIR.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.115
I'M ON A STORE MANAGER TRACK
HERE.

14:42.149 --> 14:47.387
- AND HE TOLD YOU THAT
AFTER YOU WENT TO HIM?

14:48.455 --> 14:51.424
MR. BAUER...SENT US HERE.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.260
- HE DID?

14:54.962 --> 14:59.399
- LISTEN, HONEY,
FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE?

14:59.432 --> 15:04.637
PRETENDING SOMETHING DIDN'T
HAPPEN DOESN'T MAKE IT GO AWAY.

15:18.051 --> 15:18.251
.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.119
- I'M SORRY, WHO ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT NOW?

15:20.620 --> 15:21.588
- TIANA RAYNES.
SHARKWEAR SALESGIRL.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.256
- AND SHE KEPT HER PANTIES?

15:23.290 --> 15:24.457
- YEAH, THERE WAS SEMEN ON THEM
AND HER DRESS.

15:24.491 --> 15:25.959
- BETTER THAN AN AUTOGRAPH.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.360
- WHEN DOES SHE ALLEGE
THIS TOOK PLACE?

15:27.394 --> 15:28.561
- YOU WERE IN HER STORE

15:28.595 --> 15:30.163
FOR A MARCH MADNESS EVENT,
MR. WILKINS.

15:30.197 --> 15:31.965
- I WAS EVERYWHERE
FOR MARCH MADNESS.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.233
16 CITIES IN 16 DAYS.

15:33.266 --> 15:36.336
- THIS WAS IN THE SHARKWEAR
FLAGSHIP STORE.

15:36.369 --> 15:40.107
TIANA TOOK A SELFIE WITH YOU
AND YOUR CUTOUT.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.641
THAT'S HER, THAT'S THE DRESS.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.143
- OKAY, SHE MET HIM.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.611
- WELL, SHE SAYS
HE DID MORE THAN THAT,

15:44.644 --> 15:47.347
SO WE ARE GOING TO NEED
A DNA SAMPLE TODAY, MR. WILKINS.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.182
- JUST A MINUTE. SHAKIR--
- NO, NO, LOOK,

15:49.216 --> 15:52.385
I WANNA BE
TOTALLY STRAIGHT HERE.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.689
I WAS IN A BAD PLACE.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.625
I JUST LOST MY MARRIAGE.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.227
AND MY WIFE AND I SEPARATED
ON NEW YEAR'S,

16:00.260 --> 16:03.363
AND YES, I'VE BEEN
DATING SINCE.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.365
- AND YOU "DATED"
TIANA RAYNES?

16:05.398 --> 16:07.067
- NO, HOOKED UP.

16:07.100 --> 16:10.037
ONE TIME, AFTER HOURS,
IN A--A DRESSING ROOM,

16:10.070 --> 16:13.040
AND IT WAS HER IDEA.
- THAT'S NOT HER STORY.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.375
SHE TOLD ME YOU DRUGGED HER,
AND SHE WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING

16:15.408 --> 16:17.244
IN THE STORE,
HER DRESS STAINED.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.346
- SHE SAYS THIS NOW,
FIVE MONTHS LATER?

16:19.379 --> 16:21.414
AND SHE JUST HAPPENED
TO SAVE THE PANTIES?

16:21.448 --> 16:23.016
THIS IS WELL-TIMED BLACKMAIL.

16:23.050 --> 16:24.417
- LOOK, SHE'S LYING
ABOUT THE RAPE.

16:24.451 --> 16:25.585
- YEAH, LIKE...

16:25.618 --> 16:28.521
CARLA? HMM?
LIKE MACIE-LYNN?

16:28.555 --> 16:30.323
THEY ALL SAY THAT YOU BOUGHT
THEM A DRINK,

16:30.357 --> 16:32.025
AND THE NEXT THING
THEY REMEMBER,

16:32.059 --> 16:33.360
THEY WERE NAKED,
AND THEY HAD BEEN VIOLATED!

16:33.393 --> 16:36.329
- THEY ARE LYING TOO!
- ABOUT WHAT?

16:36.363 --> 16:38.465
TIANA'S LYING
ABOUT BEING RAPED?

16:38.498 --> 16:40.333
BUT YOU DID HAVE SEX WITH HER,

16:40.367 --> 16:44.104
AND THE OTHER TWO, THEY'RE
LYING ABOUT EVERYTHING?

16:44.137 --> 16:47.807
- OKAY, OKAY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,

16:47.840 --> 16:50.643
BUT CARLA, AND THE OTHER ONE--
- MACIE-LYNN?

16:52.145 --> 16:54.347
- I MAY HAVE HAD SEX
WITH THEM ALSO.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.249
- AND IF YOU DID,
IT WAS CONSENSUAL,

16:56.283 --> 16:57.484
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, SHAKIR?

16:57.517 --> 16:59.386
- YES, ABSOLUTELY.

16:59.419 --> 17:03.156
I MEAN, SO I WASN'T ALL WARM
AND CUDDLY AFTERWARDS.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.757
I LIKE SLEEPING ALONE.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.459
YOU KNOW,
SPENDING THE NIGHT, SPOONING,

17:06.493 --> 17:08.428
IT'S NOT PART OF
THE SHAKIR WILKINS EXPERIENCE.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.131
- CAN'T BLAME YOU THERE.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.699
NOW BY THE WAY,
DO YOU HAVE A PRESCRIPTION

17:12.732 --> 17:14.234
FOR AMBIEN OR XANAX?

17:14.267 --> 17:17.270
- YES, OF COURSE I DO.

17:17.304 --> 17:18.438
I CAN'T SLEEP MOST NIGHTS

17:18.471 --> 17:22.242
BECAUSE MY WIFE
IS TRYING TO TAKE MY SON.

17:22.275 --> 17:25.245
AND THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T
ADMIT TO THE SEX.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.614
SHE WILL CRUCIFY ME WITH IT
IN THE CUSTODY BATTLE.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.449
- YOU'VE GOT BIGGER PROBLEMS
THAN A CUSTODY BATTLE,

17:29.482 --> 17:30.750
MR. WILKINS.

17:36.289 --> 17:37.624
- OKAY, NOW SHAKIR IS SAYING

17:37.657 --> 17:39.559
HE DID HAVE SEX WITH ALL THREE
OF THEM?

17:39.592 --> 17:41.261
- LET ME GUESS,
IT WAS CONSENSUAL.

17:41.294 --> 17:42.795
- IT'S POSSIBLE.

17:42.829 --> 17:45.198
I HAD TWO GIRLS CLAIM
THEIR DAD MOLESTED THEM,

17:45.232 --> 17:46.833
JUST TO GET HIM TO PAY
THEIR STUDENT LOANS OFF.

17:46.866 --> 17:49.869
- NO RAPE KITS.
NO OUTCRY AT THE TIME.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.504
BARBA'S REALLY GONNA GO FORWARD
WITH THIS?

17:51.538 --> 17:53.606
- GIVE IT A REST, GUYS.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.176
I DIDN'T WANT
TO BELIEVE IT EITHER.

17:56.209 --> 17:58.311
BUT WE'VE GOT
THREE CONSISTENT STORIES,

17:58.345 --> 18:00.413
AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT
THE WOMEN COMPARED NOTES--

18:00.447 --> 18:01.481
- THEY MAY BE JUST AFTER MONEY.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.250
THEY ALREADY GOT IT FROM BAUER.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.485
- TO KEEP QUIET
ABOUT BEING ASSAULTED.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.387
- YOU WANT AN OUTCRY WITNESS?

18:07.420 --> 18:09.422
BAUER'S YOUR GUY.
- GOOD LUCK!

18:09.456 --> 18:11.624
- YOU THINK ORION BAUER'S
GONNA TANK SHAKIR? MM-MM.

18:11.658 --> 18:14.494
I'M PREDICTING HEALTH PROBLEMS,
MINI STROKE, SOMETHING.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.696
- WE HAVE HIM
ON WITNESS BRIBERY CHARGES.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.398
THAT GIVES US LEVERAGE.
IN THE MEANTIME,

18:18.431 --> 18:20.433
LET'S VET
THE THREE COMPLAINANTS.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.569
MONEY ISSUES,
PERSONAL HISTORIES,

18:22.602 --> 18:25.272
AND ANY PREVIOUS
FALSE ACCUSATIONS.

18:25.305 --> 18:28.441
- NO, NO.
I WON'T TESTIFY AGAINST SHAKIR!

18:28.475 --> 18:30.343
IT'S NOT JUST THE MONEY,
HE'S BEEN LOYAL!

18:30.377 --> 18:32.312
HAVE YOU READ HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY?

18:32.345 --> 18:34.447
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF HE'S
READ IT, BUT THE POINT IS:

18:34.481 --> 18:36.249
HE'S AN INSPIRING STORY.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.718
- HEY, DAD, LISTEN,
WE'RE ON THEIR COURT NOW.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.187
ALL RIGHT?

18:40.220 --> 18:42.389
LET US LISTEN TO WHAT THEY HAVE
TO SAY.

18:42.422 --> 18:45.258
- MR. BAUER, WE'VE GOT
THREE CREDIBLE VICS

18:45.292 --> 18:46.893
WITH CONSISTENT STORIES.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.328
YOU'RE AN OUTCRY WITNESS
IN ALL THREE CASES.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.629
- WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?

18:49.662 --> 18:51.731
- THAT MEANS THAT THEY ALL
CAME TO YOU, DAD.

18:51.764 --> 18:54.301
- BECAUSE I'M LIKE A FATHER
TO EVERYONE IN THIS COMPANY.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.768
- AND LIKE A FATHER,
WHEN THEY CAME TO YOU

18:55.802 --> 18:58.371
THEY SAID THEY'D BEEN ATTACKED,
YOU GAVE THEM MONEY,

18:58.405 --> 19:00.473
AND YOU TOLD THEM TO KEEP QUIET.

19:00.507 --> 19:01.574
YOU'RE ON THE HOOK HERE.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.310
ASK YOUR DAUGHTER.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.912
- IF MY FATHER TESTIFIES
TO WHAT THESE WOMEN SAID,

19:05.945 --> 19:08.315
IS THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR CHARGES
NOT BEING FILED AGAINST HIM?

19:08.348 --> 19:09.949
- CHARGES FOR WHAT?

19:09.982 --> 19:12.652
- YOU PAID THEM, MR. BAUER!
- THOSE WERE BONUSES.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.921
- A WEEK BEFORE SHAKIR'S
CONTRACT WAS TO BE RENEWED?

19:14.954 --> 19:16.756
- WE RENEWED HIS CONTRACT
TWO MONTHS AGO.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.391
THE ONLY REASON
WE KEPT IT SECRET

19:18.425 --> 19:20.393
IS BECAUSE WE WANTED
TO ANNOUNCE IN THE FALL.

19:20.427 --> 19:23.396
- DAD, DAD...
LISTEN.

19:23.430 --> 19:26.266
AS PAINFUL AS THIS IS,

19:26.299 --> 19:28.868
YOU HAVE GOT TO LET SHAKIR GO.

19:28.901 --> 19:31.371
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

19:31.404 --> 19:34.274
HE CANNOT WORK FOR ORION BAY
ANYMORE.

19:34.307 --> 19:36.609
DO YOU HEAR ME?

19:38.311 --> 19:41.981
I JUST...I...

19:42.014 --> 19:43.783
I DIDN'T SEE THIS COMING.

19:43.816 --> 19:45.652
- I KNOW.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.590
- YOU MUST THINK
I'M AN OLD FOOL.

19:50.623 --> 19:53.693
- NO, DADDY.
NO, I DON'T.

19:58.465 --> 20:00.700
- NOBODY TOLD ME
I'D HAVE TO TESTIFY.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.269
- YOU MIGHT.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.271
OUR D.A. IS GOING TO ARGUE THAT
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU

20:04.304 --> 20:06.339
IS PART OF A PATTERN.

20:08.308 --> 20:09.742
- IS SHAKIR GONNA BE THERE?

20:09.776 --> 20:12.412
- YEAH.

20:12.445 --> 20:13.980
- LIKE I TOLD
THAT GIRL DETECTIVE,

20:14.013 --> 20:15.915
I DON'T REMEMBER TOO MUCH OF IT.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.650
- OKAY.

20:17.684 --> 20:20.753
LET'S JUST START WITH
THE PART THAT YOU DO REMEMBER.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.355
- YOU NEED ME TO TESTIFY?

20:22.389 --> 20:24.891
- UNDER OATH.
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

20:24.924 --> 20:28.395
- NO. NO, IT'S JUST I--
WELL, I HEARD--

20:28.428 --> 20:31.464
THE OTHER GIRL, THE BLACK ONE,
SHE SAVED HER PANTIES.

20:31.498 --> 20:33.600
- WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT?

20:33.633 --> 20:36.336
- UM, I HEARD CORDELIA
ON HER CELL.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.371
SHE WAS TALKING TO SHAKIR.
SHE WAS VERY UPSET.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.573
- YEAH, THAT EVIDENCE IS
A START, CARLA,

20:40.607 --> 20:44.344
BUT YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S
ANYTHING THAT YOU HAVE

20:44.377 --> 20:47.647
OR ANYTHING THAT YOU COULD GET
TO CORROBORATE YOUR STORY,

20:47.680 --> 20:51.017
THAT WOULD--
THAT'D BE A BIG HELP.

21:04.464 --> 21:06.433
- I'M GLAD YOU CALLED.

21:07.434 --> 21:08.968
- YOU ARE?

21:09.001 --> 21:13.039
- I'M SORRY IF I HURT YOU,

21:13.072 --> 21:17.377
AND I WANT TO MAKE THIS RIGHT,
BEFORE WE ALL GET HURT.

21:17.410 --> 21:20.012
- ALL?
ARE YOU THREATENING ME?

21:20.046 --> 21:22.349
I THOUGHT THAT
WE COULD JUST TALK.

21:22.382 --> 21:25.652
- WE BOTH KNOW I'M NOT THE ONLY
ATHLETE YOU'VE BEEN WITH.

21:27.687 --> 21:31.391
LISTEN, YOU TAKE THE STAND...

21:31.424 --> 21:33.426
IT'S FAIR GAME.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.797
BUT WE DON'T HAVE
TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.833
WE CAN MAKE ALL THIS GO AWAY.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.702
YOU CAN START OVER.

21:42.735 --> 21:46.038
YOU KNOW, MAYBE GET YOURSELF
A CONDO IN THE CITY,

21:46.072 --> 21:48.375
BUT IT'S YOUR CHOICE, CARLA.
- A CONTROLLED MEET?

21:48.408 --> 21:50.410
YOU CAN'T DO THAT ONCE HE'S
REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL.

21:50.443 --> 21:51.411
- WASN'T OUR IDEA.
THIS IS ALL HER.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.879
IT'S HER PHONE.

21:52.912 --> 21:54.614
- UH-HUH, AND SECOND OF ALL,
IT'S NOT PROBATIVE.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.583
- PLEADING IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
NEVER A SIGN OF STRENGTH.

21:56.616 --> 21:58.451
- I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT
WHY SHE WAS LYING,

21:58.485 --> 21:59.819
WHAT SHE WANTED.
- SHAKIR, YOU'VE DONE--

21:59.852 --> 22:03.456
- SHAKIR WILKINS
IS NOT A RAPIST!

22:03.490 --> 22:05.091
- AND YOU'LL GET THE OPPORTUNITY
TO TELL YOUR SIDE OF THE STORY

22:05.124 --> 22:07.594
TO THE JURY.

22:09.496 --> 22:11.097
- SHAKIR WILKINS,

22:11.130 --> 22:12.632
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.434
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.603
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL
BE HELD AGAINST YOU

22:25.645 --> 22:25.845
.

22:25.878 --> 22:26.846
- IT IS WITH A HEAVY HEART
THAT I ANNOUNCE THAT...

22:28.515 --> 22:30.517
ORION BAY IS TERMINATING
ITS RELATIONSHIP

22:30.550 --> 22:34.687
WITH SHAKIR WILKINS
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.055
- SHAKIR!
[reporters yelling]

22:36.088 --> 22:40.627
- HE IS, LIKE EVERYONE,
ENTITLED TO DUE PROCESS.

22:40.660 --> 22:42.929
ONLY MR. WILKINS
AND THESE WOMEN KNOW

22:42.962 --> 22:47.133
WHAT REALLY TRANSPIRED
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.

22:47.166 --> 22:50.403
BUT THE LACK OF JUDGMENT FOR
A MARRIED MAN TO BE ALONE,

22:50.437 --> 22:54.907
IN A ROOM, WITH THREE
DIFFERENT WOMEN AT LATE HOURS

22:54.941 --> 22:56.976
IS UNDENIABLE.

22:57.009 --> 23:00.613
WE HAVE ALWAYS CELEBRATED
ROLE MODELS,

23:00.647 --> 23:02.515
BUT NO MATTER WHAT
THE COURT DECIDES,

23:02.549 --> 23:05.785
MR. WILKINS HAS FORFEITED
THE PRIVILEGE

23:05.818 --> 23:09.756
OF REPRESENTING ORION BAY.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.057
THANK YOU.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.428
- AND WHEN THE THIRD WOMAN,
TIANA RAYNES, CAME TO YOU

23:15.462 --> 23:17.564
AND SAID SHAKIR WILKINS
HAD RAPED HER,

23:17.597 --> 23:20.032
DID YOU PROMISE HER A BONUS?
- YES, I DID.

23:20.066 --> 23:25.104
- CAN YOU TELL THE JURY WHY YOU
OFFERED THESE WOMEN BONUSES,

23:25.137 --> 23:30.877
WHICH MAY APPEAR TO SOME
AS BUYING THEIR SILENCE?

23:30.910 --> 23:32.879
- I TAKE NO JOY IN THIS.

23:32.912 --> 23:36.516
I'VE HAD A LONG-TERM
RELATIONSHIP WITH MR. WILKINS.

23:36.549 --> 23:39.919
I SIMPLY COULDN'T RECONCILE
MY KNOWLEDGE OF HIM

23:39.952 --> 23:41.921
WITH WHAT THESE WOMEN
WERE SAYING.

23:41.954 --> 23:45.091
AT THE TIME, I BELIEVED THAT
THESE WERE FALSE ALLEGATIONS.

23:45.124 --> 23:46.993
- AND NOW?

23:47.026 --> 23:50.997
- AFTER I SAW HOW UPSET
CARLA WAS IN THAT ELEVATOR,

23:51.030 --> 23:52.699
IT BEGAN TO GNAW AT ME.

23:52.732 --> 23:55.067
AND THESE OTHER GIRLS...

23:55.101 --> 23:57.770
THERE'S A SAYING:
WHEN THREE PEOPLE AT A PARTY

23:57.804 --> 24:01.808
TELL YOU YOU'RE DRUNK,
DON'T DRIVE HOME.

24:01.841 --> 24:03.175
- THANK YOU, MR. BAUER.

24:05.144 --> 24:06.846
- I'M SURE WE CAN ALL AGREE

24:06.879 --> 24:08.781
YOU'RE IN A DIFFICULT POSITION
HERE, MR. BAUER.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.082
- YES, THANK YOU.
- BUT ISN'T IT TRUE

24:10.116 --> 24:11.984
YOU'RE ONLY TESTIFYING TODAY
IN EXCHANGE

24:12.018 --> 24:14.987
FOR AVOIDING CHARGES
OF BRIBING A WITNESS?

24:15.021 --> 24:18.625
- I'M TESTIFYING HERE TODAY
BECAUSE I MADE A WRONG DECISION,

24:18.658 --> 24:19.992
AND FOR THAT, I APOLOGIZE.

24:20.026 --> 24:21.694
- BUT NO CHARGES
HAVE BEEN FILED.

24:21.728 --> 24:22.962
- CORRECT.

24:22.995 --> 24:26.599
- AT THE TIME THESE COMPLAINANTS
CAME FORWARD,

24:26.633 --> 24:27.934
DID YOU BELIEVE THEIR STORIES?

24:27.967 --> 24:30.970
- NO, I DID NOT.
I SIMPLY COULDN'T THINK

24:31.003 --> 24:33.105
THAT THE MAN I KNEW
WAS CAPABLE OF DOING

24:33.139 --> 24:34.974
THE THINGS THEY SAID
HE WAS DOING.

24:35.007 --> 24:37.777
- BUT NOW YOU DO BELIEVE
THAT SHAKIR WILKINS

24:37.810 --> 24:39.912
ASSAULTED THESE THREE WOMEN?

24:39.946 --> 24:41.848
- YES, I DO.

24:41.881 --> 24:44.751
AS I SAID, AFTER THAT SCENE IN
THE ELEVATOR WITH CARLA,

24:44.784 --> 24:48.020
REPLAYING ALL THEIR WORDS
WITHOUT BLINDERS ON,

24:48.054 --> 24:50.857
SO GOD HELP ME,
YES, I DO.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.760
- DOES THE SUDDEN CHANGE
IN YOUR BELIEFS

24:53.793 --> 24:55.895
GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO INVOKE
THE MORALS CLAUSE

24:55.928 --> 24:58.731
AND TERMINATE YOUR CONTRACT
WITH MR. WILKINS,

24:58.765 --> 25:02.001
SAVING YOUR COMPANY ROUGHLY
HALF A BILLION DOLLARS?

25:02.034 --> 25:04.871
- ROUGHLY, YES, BUT THAT'S
NOT WHY I TERMINATED HIM.

25:04.904 --> 25:07.039
- DOES GETTING OUT OF YOUR
CONTRACT WITH MR. WILKINS

25:07.073 --> 25:08.240
PROVIDE LONG-TERM RELIEF?

25:08.274 --> 25:10.943
- OBJECTION.
- WITHDRAWN.

25:10.977 --> 25:13.045
NOTHING FURTHER.

25:13.079 --> 25:15.748
- I CAME TO...

25:15.782 --> 25:17.049
NAKED...

25:17.083 --> 25:20.553
SORE...

25:20.587 --> 25:23.990
I HAD PIECES OF MEMORY
OF SHAKIR WILKINS RAPING ME.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.726
- BUT YOU DIDN'T
GO TO THE HOSPITAL?

25:26.759 --> 25:28.094
YOU DIDN'T TELL POLICE?

25:28.127 --> 25:30.930
- I WAS AFRAID OF WHAT PEOPLE
WOULD THINK OF ME,

25:30.963 --> 25:34.166
OR WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO MY JOB.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.003
- WHY COME FORWARD NOW?

25:37.036 --> 25:39.939
- WELL, I WAS ASKED TO WORK
WITH SHAKIR AGAIN

25:39.972 --> 25:43.943
AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE
FOR HIS RE-SIGNING.

25:43.976 --> 25:45.945
I COULDN'T HOLD IT IN.

25:45.978 --> 25:49.081
- I BLACKED OUT.

25:49.115 --> 25:52.952
WHEN I CAME TO,
MY CLOTHES WERE OFF...

25:52.985 --> 25:54.787
I WAS...

25:54.821 --> 25:57.824
BRUISED.

25:57.857 --> 25:58.991
I KNEW I'D BEEN RAPED.

25:59.025 --> 26:00.927
- YOU KNEW THIS...

26:00.960 --> 26:03.963
AND YET, YOU DIDN'T
CALL THE POLICE...

26:03.996 --> 26:05.131
FRIENDS, FAMILY--

26:05.164 --> 26:07.700
- I COME FROM
A GOOD CHRISTIAN HOME.

26:07.734 --> 26:11.303
I'D GONE TO A HOTEL ROOM
WITH A BLACK ATHLETE.

26:11.337 --> 26:13.305
MY MOTHER WOULD HAVE BLAMED ME,

26:13.339 --> 26:15.808
THE SAME WAY
YOU'RE BLAMING ME NOW.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.080
- THEN I WOKE UP.

26:21.113 --> 26:23.916
MY DRESS WAS RIPPED, STAINED...

26:23.950 --> 26:25.051
HE RAPED ME.

26:25.084 --> 26:28.020
- AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ANYONE.

26:28.054 --> 26:29.956
- LOOK, I KNOW
I HAVE TO DO THIS,

26:29.989 --> 26:34.661
BUT I HAD TO TAKE AN EXPRESS BUS
AND A TAXI TO GET HERE.

26:34.694 --> 26:37.296
- OKAY, WE CAN REIMBURSE YOU
FOR THAT.

26:37.329 --> 26:38.765
- AND THAT'S IT?

26:41.400 --> 26:43.870
- IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT, TIANA?

26:43.903 --> 26:45.037
- I JUST...

26:45.071 --> 26:47.940
[sighs]
FORGET IT.

26:47.974 --> 26:51.878
JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU
AND MR. BAUER WANT ME TO SAY.

26:51.911 --> 26:53.746
- WE WANT YOU TO SAY
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

26:53.780 --> 26:57.717
- LEMME LOOK AT WHAT I SAID
BEFORE, AND I'LL GET IT RIGHT.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.385
- OKAY, THEN, TELL US--
- WHAT DID YOU MEAN

26:59.418 --> 27:03.923
WHEN YOU SAID YOU'D SAY WHAT
ORION BAUER WANTED YOU TO SAY?

27:06.092 --> 27:07.960
ORION BAUER GAVE YOU A BONUS

27:07.994 --> 27:10.129
TO KEEP QUIET ABOUT THE INITIAL
COMPLAINT, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

27:10.162 --> 27:13.199
- A BONUS.
UH-HUH, RIGHT.

27:13.232 --> 27:15.401
- ARE YOU SAYING
HE DIDN'T MAKE A PAYMENT?

27:18.004 --> 27:19.171
WHAT?

27:19.205 --> 27:21.240
- HOW MUCH IS THAT SUIT?
TWO GRAND?

27:21.273 --> 27:23.042
- I BEG YOUR PARDON?
- AND THAT TIE?

27:23.075 --> 27:25.144
PLEASE, I WORK RETAIL.
YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW?

27:25.177 --> 27:27.680
- OKAY, TIANA, WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH THIS?

27:27.714 --> 27:31.083
- OH, HELLO, WHITE GIRL.

27:31.117 --> 27:35.788
ORION BAUER PAID ME HALF-ASSED
WHAT HE PAID THOSE OTHER GIRLS.

27:35.822 --> 27:37.389
- AND HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS?

27:37.423 --> 27:40.459
- I HEARD IT ON LMZ.
DO YOU THINK I'M STUPID?

27:40.492 --> 27:42.294
HE PAID THEM FIVE GRAND.

27:42.328 --> 27:44.396
SO MAYBE YOU CALL HIM
AND MAKE IT RIGHT,

27:44.430 --> 27:47.066
THEN I'LL REMEMBER BETTER.

27:47.099 --> 27:49.936
- AND HE PAID THEM FOR WHAT?
TO KEEP QUIET ABOUT THE RAPE?

27:49.969 --> 27:51.971
[scoffs]
PLEASE.

27:55.975 --> 28:01.814
ALL I KNOW IS, I GOT PAID
TO SAY SHAKIR RAPED ME.

28:11.357 --> 28:15.995
- ARE YOU SAYING--

28:16.028 --> 28:18.464
ARE YOU SAYING SHAKIR WILKINS
DID NOT RAPE YOU?

28:18.497 --> 28:22.401
- I'M SAYING YOU GET MR. BAUER
TO GIVE THE RIGHT AMOUNT,

28:22.434 --> 28:24.971
THE FAIR AMOUNT?

28:25.004 --> 28:28.074
I'LL SAY WHATEVER
THE TWO OF YOU WANT ME TO SAY.

28:28.107 --> 28:29.408
HELL, I'LL DO YOU NASTY
LIKE I DID SHAKIR

28:29.441 --> 28:31.978
IN THAT DRESSING ROOM,
BUT YOU GOT TO MAN UP,

28:45.491 --> 28:45.892
.

28:45.925 --> 28:46.725
- WITNESS TAMPERING.
FALSE ACCUSATIONS.

28:48.527 --> 28:50.229
THESE ARE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS.

28:50.262 --> 28:52.899
- WHICH IS WHY I MOVE FOR AN
IMMEDIATE DISMISSAL, YOUR HONOR.

28:52.932 --> 28:54.767
- I'VE GOTTEN FULL DISCLOSURE,
BRADY MATERIAL,

28:54.801 --> 28:56.903
I NEED TIME TO INVESTIGATE
THIS WITNESS'S STORY.

28:56.936 --> 28:59.205
- SHE ADMITTED SHE TOOK PAYMENTS
FROM ORION BAUER

28:59.238 --> 29:00.807
TO MAKE A FALSE ALLEGATION.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.408
HOW MUCH MORE DO YOU NEED
TO INVESTIGATE?

29:02.441 --> 29:04.043
- SHE COULD BE LYING NOW.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.845
TO EXTORT ORION BAUER
FOR MORE MONEY.

29:05.878 --> 29:08.147
- THIS WHOLE CASE HAS BEEN A
SHAKEDOWN FROM THE GET.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.983
HER CREDIBILITY IS SHOT, SO ARE
YOUR OTHER TWO WITNESSES'.

29:11.017 --> 29:12.351
- WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

29:12.384 --> 29:14.253
I'M NOT DISMISSING CHARGES.

29:14.286 --> 29:16.923
BUT I WILL GRANT
A 48-HOUR CONTINUANCE

29:16.956 --> 29:18.891
UNTIL THIS IS SORTED OUT.

29:18.925 --> 29:21.961
GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT
AND NARROW, MR. BARBA.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.834
- KEEP IT.
SO CARLA AND MACIE-LYNN

29:27.867 --> 29:30.169
AREN'T CHANGING THEIR STORIES.
THEY DEFINITELY GOT PAID MORE.

29:30.202 --> 29:31.838
- IS THAT FOR ALL OF US?
- OH, YEAH.

29:31.871 --> 29:35.341
GOAT CHEESE
AND SUN-DRIED TOMATO.

29:35.374 --> 29:37.343
- MADE YOU FOR A PEPPERONI GUY.

29:37.376 --> 29:40.046
- I'M FULL OF SURPRISES.

29:40.079 --> 29:41.347
THIS WHOLE CASE IS A CROCK.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.515
- I MEAN, I KINDA CALLED IT.
HELLO?

29:43.549 --> 29:45.217
- YEAH, WE STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

29:45.251 --> 29:46.919
- HOW DO YOU EVER REALLY KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED?

29:46.953 --> 29:49.889
I MEAN, A MAN AND A WOMAN,
ALONE IN A ROOM...

29:49.922 --> 29:51.257
THERE'S A HUNDRED DIFFERENT
STORIES HOW THAT PLAYS OUT

29:51.290 --> 29:52.892
AND MOST OF THEM
AREN'T CRIMINAL.

29:52.925 --> 29:54.160
NOT GOOD, EITHER.

29:54.193 --> 29:57.596
- CARISI, REMIND ME WHY
YOU'RE SVU, AGAIN?

29:57.629 --> 30:01.200
- I WORKED HOMICIDE,
COUPLE YEARS.

30:01.233 --> 30:05.071
IT'S--IT'S THE WOMEN
WHO GET YOU.

30:05.104 --> 30:08.074
I MEAN, THEY'RE DEAD, BUT--

30:08.107 --> 30:10.209
BUT THEIR HAIR'S CLEAN,
THEY'RE NICELY DRESSED,

30:10.242 --> 30:12.344
THEY'RE MADE UP.

30:12.378 --> 30:15.414
AND THAT MEANS THEIR HUSBANDS
OR THEIR BOYFRIENDS DID IT.

30:17.116 --> 30:19.051
IT'S LIKE THEY KNEW.

30:19.085 --> 30:24.023
THEY KNEW IT WAS COMING,
THEY DON'T EVEN LOOK SURPRISED.

30:24.056 --> 30:27.293
JUST--

30:27.326 --> 30:29.261
JUST FINISHED.

30:34.100 --> 30:36.335
IT DOESN'T, YOU KNOW, MAKE ME
TREASURE EVERY MOMENT

30:36.368 --> 30:38.437
OR ANY OF THAT CRAP, BUT--

30:41.107 --> 30:43.175
- OKAY.

30:45.011 --> 30:47.446
UH, MEANWHILE, CARLA CANNON
IS ON HER WAY UP.

30:47.479 --> 30:49.315
- WILL SHE HOLD
OR WILL SHE FOLD, HUH?

30:49.348 --> 30:51.217
I GOT THIS.

30:53.552 --> 30:55.888
BUT YOU ALREADY GOT MONEY ONCE
FROM ORION BAUER, RIGHT?

30:55.922 --> 30:57.924
- YES, TO KEEP QUIET,
BUT I COULDN'T GET OVER

30:57.957 --> 31:00.159
WHAT SHAKIR DID TO ME.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.028
- YOU'RE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE
IF YOU'RE LYING HERE, CARLA.

31:02.061 --> 31:04.630
- NO, ACTUALLY, YOU'RE NOT,
CARLA.

31:04.663 --> 31:06.432
LISTEN TO ME.

31:06.465 --> 31:09.635
THE IMPORTANT THING
IS THAT YOU COME CLEAN NOW.

31:09.668 --> 31:12.371
- SHAKIR RAPED ME.
I SWEAR TO GOD.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.242
- JUST GIVE IT TO US STRAIGHT!

31:16.275 --> 31:18.945
IF YOU MADE A MISTAKE, IT'S NOT
GONNA COME BACK ON YOU NOW.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.279
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
I'M NOT LYING

31:20.312 --> 31:21.447
ABOUT WHAT THAT MAN DID TO ME.
- ALL RIGHT.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.249
SO IT IS YOUR TESTIMONY

31:23.282 --> 31:26.218
THAT YOU DID NOT TAKE ORION
BAUER'S MONEY TO LIE?

31:26.252 --> 31:29.388
- NO, MA'AM.
NO, I DID NOT.

31:29.421 --> 31:32.058
IF THAT BLACK GIRL SAYS
DIFFERENT, THEN SHE'S LYING.

31:32.091 --> 31:33.625
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

31:33.659 --> 31:36.228
THAT BLACK GIRL
IS SHAKING ME DOWN AGAIN?

31:36.262 --> 31:37.629
- DAD.
- NO, NO, NO.

31:37.663 --> 31:41.033
SHE CAME CRYING TO ME.
I TRIED TO MAKE IT RIGHT.

31:41.067 --> 31:43.936
I GAVE HER $800,
NOW SHE WANTS MORE?

31:43.970 --> 31:45.671
INGRATITUDE!

31:45.704 --> 31:48.007
- NOW, ARE YOU DENYING YOU GAVE
TIANA MONEY TO CLAIM RAPE?

31:48.040 --> 31:49.608
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
I'M DENYING, LADY.

31:49.641 --> 31:51.343
IT'S AN OUTRIGHT LIE.

31:51.377 --> 31:52.711
NOT THAT I SHOULD BE SURPRISED.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.246
- MM-HMM, AND WHY IS THAT?
- DAD, STOP.

31:54.280 --> 31:55.647
- THAT GIRL DIDN'T
EVEN GRADUATE.

31:55.681 --> 31:58.317
I WAS THE ONE THAT MADE HER
ASSISTANT STORE MANAGER.

31:58.350 --> 32:01.153
BECAUSE THE WAY I GREW UP,
BACKGROUND DIDN'T MATTER.

32:01.187 --> 32:02.621
IT WAS A MATTER OF CHARACTER,
INTEGRITY.

32:02.654 --> 32:04.223
IT WAS A MATTER OF LOYALTY!

32:04.256 --> 32:06.092
- OKAY, I THINK THAT
THAT'S ENOUGH.

32:06.125 --> 32:08.694
- IT'S A LONG PATH, A STRANGE
JOURNEY WE ARE ALL TRAVELING

32:08.727 --> 32:11.530
WITH OUR TRIBES, OUR FAMILIES.

32:11.563 --> 32:14.366
JUST THE WAY OF OUR CULTURE,
JUST THE DAMN WAY OF IT.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.402
- THIS IS VERY SIMPLE.
DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT

32:16.435 --> 32:18.670
PAY TIANA RAYNES
TO MAKE FALSE ALLEGATIONS?

32:18.704 --> 32:20.672
- THE HELL I DID NOT!

32:20.706 --> 32:22.674
DID YOU ASK THE OTHER GIRLS?
THE WHITE GIRLS?

32:22.708 --> 32:24.543
- DAD.
- BECAUSE IF YOU DID,

32:24.576 --> 32:26.645
YOU WOULD DISCOVER THAT THEY
DIDN'T CHANGE THEIR STORIES.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.680
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY DIDN'T?
ARE YOU IN TOUCH WITH THEM?

32:28.714 --> 32:30.582
- DAD, YOU HAVE TO STOP NOW.
- NO.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.084
- DAD, PLEASE--
- CORDELIA, CORDELIA!

32:32.118 --> 32:33.652
I'M IN CHARGE HERE!

32:33.685 --> 32:35.121
NOW LOOK, I LOVE YOU,
BUT YOU HAVE NO MORE SENSE

32:35.154 --> 32:36.488
THAN YOUR MOTHER DID!

32:36.522 --> 32:38.290
YOU'RE BLIND!
- WE ARE DONE HERE.

32:38.324 --> 32:40.259
ALL OF THAT WAS OFF THE RECORD.
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO LEAVE NOW.

32:40.292 --> 32:41.727
PLEASE.
THIS IS ENOUGH.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.629
- SO NOW YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT ME?

32:43.662 --> 32:45.297
ABOUT THE COMPANY?
HMM?

32:45.331 --> 32:47.666
NOW YOU'RE A GOOD GIRL?

32:47.699 --> 32:49.501
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

32:49.535 --> 32:51.670
BECAUSE I FORGIVE YOU,
MY DARLING.

32:51.703 --> 32:54.340
I FORGIVE YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

33:02.048 --> 33:03.649
- PLEASE.

33:12.691 --> 33:13.792
- WHAT WAS THAT?
EARLY DEMENTIA?

33:13.825 --> 33:16.728
OUR JOURNEY, OUR TRIBES?
- I DON'T KNOW.

33:19.798 --> 33:21.633
YOU GO ON AHEAD.
- SHE CAN'T TALK TO YOU

33:21.667 --> 33:22.768
ABOUT THE CASE,
SHE'S HIS LAWYER.

33:22.801 --> 33:25.737
- WE CAN TALK ABOUT FATHERS.

33:25.771 --> 33:27.273
HEY, CORDELIA.

33:28.274 --> 33:29.675
YOU ALL RIGHT?

33:29.708 --> 33:31.510
- I'M FINE.

33:31.543 --> 33:33.479
- IS YOUR FATHER ALWAYS LIKE--
- LARGER THAN LIFE?

33:33.512 --> 33:35.147
ABSOLUTELY,
AND I LOVE HIM FOR IT.

33:35.181 --> 33:38.050
HE'S OLD SCHOOL.
A LION.

33:38.084 --> 33:39.551
- YEAH, CAN YOU HELP ME
UNDERSTAND SOMETHING?

33:39.585 --> 33:42.354
I DON'T THINK YOUR DAD
IS THE KIND OF MAN

33:42.388 --> 33:44.423
THAT WOULD COMPLETELY DESTROY
SOMEONE'S REPUTATION

33:44.456 --> 33:46.225
JUST TO VOID A CONTRACT.

33:46.258 --> 33:48.360
- NO, HE WOULD NEVER.

33:48.394 --> 33:50.729
RAISED ME TO BELIEVE
THAT YOUR WORD IS YOUR BOND.

33:50.762 --> 33:54.400
USED TO SAY IF YOU EVER BETRAY
THAT, YOU ARE DEAD TO HIM.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.535
- WHAT DID HE MEAN WHEN HE SAID
THAT YOU WERE BLIND,

33:56.568 --> 33:59.671
AND HE FORGIVES YOU?
FORGIVES YOU FOR WHAT?

34:00.839 --> 34:03.642
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

34:15.154 --> 34:15.354
.

34:15.387 --> 34:15.987
- THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

34:17.456 --> 34:18.424
ORION BAUER PAID THE STORE CLERK

34:18.457 --> 34:19.558
TO SAY THAT I RAPED HER?

34:19.591 --> 34:22.694
- YEAH, TIANA FINALLY
GAVE THAT UP.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.563
- WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER TWO?
- WELL, THEY'RE STILL CLAIMING

34:24.596 --> 34:27.499
YOU RAPED THEM.
- I DIDN'T.

34:27.533 --> 34:29.301
I SWEAR.

34:29.335 --> 34:31.470
I MEAN, THIS CAN'T BE ABOUT
THE MONEY ON MY CONTRACT.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.339
THE OLD MAN MAKES
A FORTUNE OFF ME.

34:33.372 --> 34:36.375
- OKAY, CAN YOU THINK OF
ANY REASON OR RHYME

34:36.408 --> 34:40.446
BAUER WANTS TO DESTROY YOU?

34:45.484 --> 34:48.120
- HONEY!

34:48.154 --> 34:49.755
I THOUGHT YOU'D LEFT.

34:49.788 --> 34:51.390
- I DID, I CAME BACK.

34:51.423 --> 34:53.225
- WELL, I'LL TAKE YOU TO DINNER.

34:53.259 --> 34:56.795
AFTER TODAY, WHAT I NEED IS A
GOOD STEAK AND A STIFF SCOTCH.

34:59.498 --> 35:03.135
- UH, DAD, THE POLICE HAVE BEEN
ASKING ALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS.

35:03.169 --> 35:05.904
I CAN'T BE YOUR LAWYER.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.639
I MAY BE INVOLVED.

35:07.673 --> 35:09.175
- WELL, I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE
MY LAWYER ANYMORE.

35:09.208 --> 35:11.243
I'LL GET MYSELF A REAL LAWYER.

35:11.277 --> 35:12.544
WHAT IS ALL THIS ABOUT?

35:12.578 --> 35:15.181
- YOU TELL ME.

35:15.214 --> 35:16.448
- THAT BLACK GIRL LYING
ABOUT ME?

35:16.482 --> 35:18.650
- WHAT DID YOU DO, DADDY?
WHAT DID YOU DO?

35:18.684 --> 35:21.853
- YOU DOUBTING MY WORD?

35:21.887 --> 35:26.192
- A FEW MONTHS AGO YOU ASKED ME
TO STAY AWAY FROM SHAKIR.

35:26.225 --> 35:29.295
SAID HE WAS MARRIED,
THAT HE WAS A PLAYER.

35:29.328 --> 35:33.532
- AND I WAS RIGHT.
SHAKIR IS A BAD GUY.

35:33.565 --> 35:35.701
WHICH BREAKS MY HEART.

35:35.734 --> 35:39.538
I TRUSTED HIM,
WHICH I SHOULDN'T HAVE.

35:39.571 --> 35:42.341
HE SCREWS EVERYTHING THAT MOVES.

35:44.276 --> 35:46.378
- DID THOSE GIRLS...

35:46.412 --> 35:48.380
REALLY COME TO YOU, DADDY,
OR DID YOU--

35:48.414 --> 35:50.349
DID YOU FIND THEM?

35:50.382 --> 35:52.251
IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THAT HARD.

35:52.284 --> 35:55.521
HIS BODYGUARD, HIS DRIVER, THEY
ALL REPORT TO YOU, DON'T THEY?

35:55.554 --> 35:57.256
- WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME THIS?

35:57.289 --> 36:00.859
- I'M ASKING YOU
IF YOU SET ALL THIS UP.

36:02.861 --> 36:03.862
OH, YOU DID, DIDN'T YOU?

36:03.895 --> 36:05.864
YOU HAD SHAKIR FOLLOWED.

36:05.897 --> 36:08.500
YOU KNEW WHO HE HAD SEX WITH,
AND YOU WENT TO THEM,

36:08.534 --> 36:10.369
AND YOU PAID THEM TO LIE.

36:10.402 --> 36:12.371
- NO, THEY CAME TO ME.

36:12.404 --> 36:14.506
- YOU FRAMED SHAKIR, DADDY.
WHY, WHY?

36:14.540 --> 36:17.576
AFTER ALL HE'S DONE FOR YOU,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.711
- ALL HE'S DONE FOR ME?
- YES!

36:19.745 --> 36:21.413
- WHAT ABOUT WHAT
I'VE DONE FOR HIM?

36:21.447 --> 36:23.382
I'VE GIVEN HIM MILLIONS!

36:23.415 --> 36:27.553
AND THE SON OF A BITCH REPAYS ME
BY SCREWING MY ONLY DAUGHTER.

36:34.893 --> 36:37.229
YOU LIED TO ME.

36:37.263 --> 36:39.898
YOU TWO WERE CARRYING ON
BEHIND MY BACK.

36:39.931 --> 36:42.534
YOU'RE RIGHT,
I DID HAVE EYES ON SHAKIR.

36:42.568 --> 36:45.371
AND YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE HE PARTIES.

36:45.404 --> 36:47.306
THOSE THREE GIRLS
THAT I PAID OFF?

36:47.339 --> 36:49.408
I COULD HAVE FOUND A DOZEN MORE.

36:49.441 --> 36:51.777
AND YOU ARE VERY LUCKY YOU
DIDN'T GET THE AIDS.

36:51.810 --> 36:53.379
- [scoffs]

36:53.412 --> 36:55.414
I KNOW ALL ABOUT
HIS ACTING OUT.

36:55.447 --> 36:57.449
ALL RIGHT, I CONFRONTED HIM
A MONTH AGO,

36:57.483 --> 36:59.951
AND HE KNOWS THAT THAT PART OF
HIS LIFE, IT HAS TO STOP.

36:59.985 --> 37:01.887
- HE ONLY TOLD YOU THAT BECAUSE
HE WANTS YOU TO KEEP

37:01.920 --> 37:04.590
HIS LITTLE BASTARD BABY.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.562
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

37:10.596 --> 37:13.899
- YOU EXPECT ME TO STAND BY AND
BECOME THE LAUGHING STOCK

37:13.932 --> 37:16.502
OF CORPORATE AMERICA?

37:16.535 --> 37:19.037
WHILE THIS SON OF A BITCH
KNOCKS YOU UP?

37:19.070 --> 37:20.539
IT'S ALL OVER YOUR
HEALTH INSURANCE.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.341
- YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO LOOK AT THAT, DADDY.

37:22.374 --> 37:23.775
- I'M A TRUSTEE.

37:23.809 --> 37:25.544
BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH THE PRICE OF BEANS?

37:25.577 --> 37:26.978
THE POINT IS, YOU LIED.

37:27.012 --> 37:29.515
YOU WANNA MAKE A FOOL
OF YOURSELF AND BE HIS WHORE?

37:29.548 --> 37:31.517
GO RIGHT AHEAD, THAT'S FINE.

37:31.550 --> 37:33.952
BUT WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WHEN
YOU WALK INTO THE MAIDSTONE CLUB

37:33.985 --> 37:36.688
WITH A LITTLE BLACK BABY
CLINGING ONTO YOU?

37:36.722 --> 37:38.690
AND WHEN HE GOES TO DALTON?

37:38.724 --> 37:39.991
WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'RE
GONNA SAY?

37:40.025 --> 37:42.494
"OH, HERE COMES
THE SCHOLARSHIP BOY?"

37:42.528 --> 37:43.962
- YOU CAN'T SAY THESE THINGS,
DADDY.

37:43.995 --> 37:45.431
- OH, YES, I CAN.
- YOU CAN'T SAY THESE THINGS.

37:45.464 --> 37:47.466
YES, I CAN! THESE PEOPLE COME
INTO OUR HOMES.

37:47.499 --> 37:49.034
THEY COME INTO OUR FAMILIES.

37:49.067 --> 37:51.537
THEY ARE ANIMALS.

37:51.570 --> 37:53.339
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO
TO PROTECT YOU

37:53.372 --> 37:55.641
FROM MAKING THE BIGGEST
MISTAKE--

37:55.674 --> 37:57.309
- ANIMALS?

37:57.343 --> 37:58.844
HE MAKES HIS LIVING
OFF ATHLETES,

37:58.877 --> 38:01.413
AND HE TALKS LIKE THAT?
- WOW.

38:01.447 --> 38:05.651
LOOK, HE'S GOTTA BE SENILE,
OR CRAZY, OR...BOTH

38:05.684 --> 38:07.453
- YEAH, I FEEL BAD FOR CORDELIA.

38:07.486 --> 38:10.356
HER FATHER'S A NARCISSIST.
SHE FELL FOR ANOTHER ONE.

38:10.389 --> 38:12.491
SHE NEVER HAD A CHANCE.
- AND HOW DID WE...

38:12.524 --> 38:13.992
GET THIS TAPE?

38:14.025 --> 38:16.362
- I CAN'T TELL YOU.
AND I HAD TO PROMISE

38:16.395 --> 38:19.365
IT WOULDN'T BE USED
AGAINST MR. BAUER.

38:19.398 --> 38:21.700
BUT WE KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS.

38:23.935 --> 38:25.671
- IN LIGHT OF NEW EVIDENCE,
WE'RE ASKING

38:25.704 --> 38:28.907
FOR AN IMMEDIATE DISMISSAL
OF ALL CHARGES, YOUR HONOR.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.476
- MR. BARBA?

38:30.509 --> 38:33.078
- THE PEOPLE HAVE NO OBJECTION.

38:33.111 --> 38:35.113
- SO ORDERED.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.583
MR. WILKINS,
YOU ARE FREE TO GO.

38:46.725 --> 38:49.461
- WIN SOME, LOSE SOME,
MR. BARBA.

38:49.495 --> 38:50.896
NICE TIE.

38:58.470 --> 39:02.774
- I'M GONNA GO UPSTAIRS
AND...DUCK CALLS.

39:02.808 --> 39:04.443
- SO BAUER JUST GETS AWAY
WITH THIS.

39:04.476 --> 39:06.512
- MY BET?
A TAPE LIKE THAT?

39:06.545 --> 39:07.879
SOONER OR LATER IT COMES OUT.

39:07.913 --> 39:09.381
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT
THESE THREE GIRLS?

39:09.415 --> 39:11.517
THEY LIED, UNDER OATH.
THEY JUST GET TO SKATE?

39:11.550 --> 39:14.520
- GENERAL POLICY FOR THE D.A.
IS WHEN YOU GO AFTER GIRLS

39:14.553 --> 39:17.423
WHEN A CASE FALLS APART,
IT CAN PREVENT REAL VICTIMS

39:17.456 --> 39:19.725
FROM COMING FORWARD NEXT TIME.

39:19.758 --> 39:21.560
- I GET THAT.
- YEAH, USUALLY I DO,

39:21.593 --> 39:23.695
BUT THIS TIME?

39:23.729 --> 39:26.097
CARISI, YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT
THOSE GIRLS ALL ALONG.

39:26.131 --> 39:28.967
- NOT REALLY.
I MISSED BAUER PAID THEM OFF.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.537
- THEY WERE JUST HIS PAWNS.
LIKE SHAKIR, LIKE HIS DAUGHTER.

39:31.570 --> 39:34.540
- I SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT.
JUST RIGHT IN MY BLIND SPOT.

39:34.573 --> 39:37.676
- NO, HE WAS GOOD.
THAT OLD MAN ACT OF HIS?

39:37.709 --> 39:39.711
HE PLAYED US.

39:39.745 --> 39:41.112
WHAT IS THAT EXPRESSION?

39:41.146 --> 39:43.048
"THERE ARE NO
ACCIDENTAL BILLIONAIRES."

39:43.081 --> 39:44.916
[reporters shouting]
- HERE! OVER HERE!

39:46.452 --> 39:48.119
- SHAKIR!
WE HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU!

39:48.153 --> 39:50.522
COME ON OVER HERE!
SHAKIR!

39:50.556 --> 39:53.124
- I'M, UH...

39:53.158 --> 39:56.562
I'M SO SORRY.
- YEAH.

39:56.595 --> 39:58.196
I LOST MY CONTRACT.
I LOST EVERYTHING.

39:58.229 --> 40:01.567
- YOU HAVE A CASE AGAINST THE
COMPANY, AND MY FATHER, AND--

40:01.600 --> 40:04.470
- I'M NEVER GETTING
MY NAME BACK!

40:04.503 --> 40:07.038
I'M A PUNCH LINE NOW.

40:07.072 --> 40:08.740
YOU GOOGLE ME AND THE FIRST
THING THAT COMES UP

40:08.774 --> 40:11.142
IS "ACCUSED RAPIST."

40:11.176 --> 40:12.778
YOU SHOULD HAVE TRUSTED ME.

40:12.811 --> 40:14.946
- BUT YOU LIED ABOUT
THE OTHER WOMEN.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.948
- I DIDN'T RAPE THEM.

40:24.022 --> 40:26.692
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

40:26.725 --> 40:28.627
I'M SORRY.

40:28.660 --> 40:33.131
IT WAS OLD HABIT,
I WAS ON THE ROAD.

40:33.164 --> 40:35.567
IT'S HOW I LOST MY MARRIAGE.

40:41.540 --> 40:45.176
OKAY, I...
I WANT TO BE IN YOUR LIFE.

40:45.210 --> 40:50.949
IF YOU CAN FORGIVE ME,
I'D LIKE TO TRY.

40:50.982 --> 40:54.620
WE CAN START OVER.

40:54.653 --> 40:58.023
A NEW LIFE...

40:58.056 --> 41:00.592
AND WE CAN RAISE
THIS BABY TOGETHER.

41:00.626 --> 41:02.994
- [laughs]

41:10.702 --> 41:15.040
IT'S, UH...
IT'S TOO LATE.

41:15.073 --> 41:17.108
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

41:18.710 --> 41:21.947
- THERE IS NO BABY.
NOT ANYMORE.

41:25.784 --> 41:28.486
AFTER TIANA CAME FORWARD,
I, UH...

41:35.260 --> 41:41.266
- [crying]

41:46.137 --> 41:48.540
- ALL THAT HATE
AND THEY'RE STILL TALKING.

41:48.574 --> 41:51.543
- GOTTA BE A TOUGH CONVERSATION.
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

41:51.577 --> 41:53.111
WHERE TO BEGIN?

41:53.144 --> 41:54.846
- ONE OF THEM IS SAYING:

41:54.880 --> 41:58.249
"LET'S START OVER,"
AND THE OTHER ONE IS SAYING...

41:58.283 --> 42:01.286
"IT'S TOO LATE."
