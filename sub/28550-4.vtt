Barb and Juniper:
Ooh! Ah!

10:48.710 --> 10:51.670
(chomping)

10:53.330 --> 10:54.750
Aah!

10:56.210 --> 10:57.580
(shrieks)

11:00.580 --> 11:03.620
(screaming)

11:03.620 --> 11:07.120
What's his problem,
Mama?

11:07.120 --> 11:09.790
Not a clue, baby!

11:12.250 --> 11:15.960
Whoa. And I thought
my algebra homework was hard.

11:15.960 --> 11:18.710
Algebra? Uh, I only got
an A-minus in that.

11:18.710 --> 11:20.580
Of course,
I was nine.

11:22.540 --> 11:24.750
Wow. Brag much?

11:24.750 --> 11:28.040
Sorry. I graduated high school
when I was 13, so...

11:28.040 --> 11:31.790
-So that's a yes
on the bragging.
-No! I, uh... um...

11:31.790 --> 11:33.460
Yeah. I guess it
came out that way.

11:33.460 --> 11:37.170
-(laughs) I'm just
messing with you.
-(chuckles): Oh. Right.

11:37.170 --> 11:40.420
A kid in high school. Huh.
Dances must have been
way awkward.

11:40.420 --> 11:42.960
-I didn't have time
for stuff like that.
-Sad!

11:42.960 --> 11:46.420
Hey, there's a dance
at my school this weekend.
You want to go?

11:46.420 --> 11:49.790
That sounds... normal.

11:49.790 --> 11:52.170
-Are you messing
with me now?
-No! I...

11:52.170 --> 11:53.750
I mean, I'm in.

11:53.750 --> 11:57.000
Oh, you guys are gonna
have so much fun!
More lemonade?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.460
Homework at Joe's
next time?

11:59.460 --> 12:03.210
And they were eatin'
the fish... whole.

12:03.210 --> 12:06.080
-Fred: Whole, you say?
-Whole.

12:06.080 --> 12:08.500
Fred: Mm-hmm.
Interesting.

12:08.500 --> 12:11.120
Go Go:
Baymax, can you scan
for High Voltage?

12:11.120 --> 12:12.330
Baymax:
Scanning now.

12:12.330 --> 12:15.040
I am unable
to locate High Voltage.

12:15.040 --> 12:16.040
Scan jammer?

12:16.040 --> 12:18.000
I am not detecting any
scan interference.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.880
Fred:
Which bring us back
to Fred's eel theory.

12:20.880 --> 12:24.000
-Go Go: Do we have to?
-Yes! Did you hear
what the man said?

12:24.000 --> 12:25.380
They were eating fish!

12:25.380 --> 12:27.540
-So?
-Whole!

12:27.540 --> 12:30.580
I know. But there has to be
a less stupid explanation.
Right?

12:30.580 --> 12:34.830
-I'm liking the eel theory.
-Fred: And I like you.

12:36.830 --> 12:40.170
-(ping-pong ball bouncing)
-(Honey Lemon and Wasabi
grunting)

12:40.170 --> 12:42.210
(grunting continues)

12:45.380 --> 12:48.620
Baymax: Hiro,
you appear distracted.
How do you feel?

12:48.620 --> 12:51.290
Huh? Oh, uh...
I'm all right.

12:51.290 --> 12:54.210
And he's doing great
on his own.

12:54.210 --> 12:56.460
-(Wasabi exclaims)
-(thuds)

12:56.460 --> 12:58.170
(whimpers)

12:59.830 --> 13:03.040
-(whirring)
-Baymax:
Ba-la-la-la-la-la!

13:03.040 --> 13:06.790
-Hiro, is something wrong?
-No, I just, uh...

13:06.790 --> 13:10.040
Hey. What was high school
like for you guys?

13:10.040 --> 13:13.040
Ah. Well, for me
it was test anxiety.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.880
I only remember
the text anxiety.

13:14.880 --> 13:18.420
Pre-test anxiety,
post-test anxiety,
mid-test anxiety.

13:18.420 --> 13:21.000
High school's
where I fell in love
with chemistry.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.250
And Andre,
exchange student.

13:24.250 --> 13:27.250
-(sighs)
C'est la vie.
-O-kay.

13:27.250 --> 13:28.670
Why do you ask?

13:28.670 --> 13:31.250
Sometimes I wonder
if I'm missing out.

13:31.250 --> 13:36.170
You know, doing the stuff
kids my age usually do.

13:36.170 --> 13:40.080
Baymax:
Hiro, it is time to get
ready for the dance.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.880
You know what?
Tonight's gonna be
as normal as it gets.

13:42.880 --> 13:47.290
-A school dance.
-Yeah! You're gonna
have so much fun, Hiro!

13:47.290 --> 13:49.250
Wear deodorant.

13:49.250 --> 13:51.540
Baymax: That is
excellent advice.

13:51.540 --> 13:55.120
Your underarm apocrine
glands become active
in puberty--

13:55.120 --> 13:58.210
Got it!
Okay, let's go.

14:01.170 --> 14:03.170
So, how do I look?

14:04.210 --> 14:07.620
-Baymax: With you eyes.
-Ha-ha, very funny.

14:07.620 --> 14:10.460
-Baymax: But factual.
-Aunt Cass: Hiro!
Megan's here!

14:17.330 --> 14:20.420
Hurry. We better go,
or Aunt Cass is gonna
take a ton of--

14:20.420 --> 14:22.040
-Aah!
-(camera shutter clicks)

14:22.040 --> 14:26.000
Oh, you two look great!
Ooh, Hiro's first dance!
I can't believe it.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.580
Get together
and smile, okay?
Smile!

14:28.580 --> 14:32.170
-(whispers): Sorry about this.
-My dad did the same thing.

14:32.170 --> 14:33.920
-Aunt Cass: Just one more.
-(camera shutter clicking)

14:33.920 --> 14:35.790
Okay, that was three.
But I had to.
(chuckles)

14:35.790 --> 14:38.750
-Have so much fun!
-Thanks, Aunt Cass.
We will.

14:38.750 --> 14:41.420
-(camera shutter clicks)
-Aunt Cass: Had to.

It's not that bad.

18:10.580 --> 18:12.040
It kind of is!

18:15.000 --> 18:16.170
Should not have
said that.

I'm so over these two.

Baymax:
I have got you.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.170
Guys, get behind me.

18:44.330 --> 18:46.500
I told you I love
gummy bunnies!

18:50.380 --> 18:53.460
Fred:
Wow. They really
leveled up.

18:53.460 --> 18:55.040
Phase two.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.790
Tell me you have an idea.

18:56.790 --> 18:59.460
What's the matter,
Big Hero 6? Scared?

-(electricity crackling)
-(Honey Lemon groans)

19:07.580 --> 19:09.580
And disturbing.

19:09.580 --> 19:12.540
Fred, ready to use
those new powers
you were talking about?

19:12.540 --> 19:14.500
Oh, yeah. So ready.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.330
Chameleo-flage.

19:16.330 --> 19:17.670
Just... something
I'm working on.

19:17.670 --> 19:20.330
We can talk about it
later, if I say it or not.
It's up to you guys.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.210
I really missed this.

19:24.210 --> 19:26.540
So did I.
I feel more powerful than ever.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.710
Who cares
if we look like fish?

19:30.250 --> 19:32.620
-(thudding)
-(grunting)

19:32.620 --> 19:34.920
Why would we want
to give this up
for normal lives?

19:34.920 --> 19:37.380
I don't know!
I'm having so much fun!

19:39.580 --> 19:41.670
-Fred: Me too!
-Huh?

19:41.670 --> 19:43.750
(clattering)

19:43.750 --> 19:45.080
(squeaking)

19:45.080 --> 19:47.080
Gotcha!

19:47.080 --> 19:49.210
(grunting)

19:49.210 --> 19:51.210
Not quite.
(grunts)

19:52.620 --> 19:53.620
Fred: Huh?

19:54.670 --> 19:56.580
Nice try,
though.

19:56.580 --> 19:58.540
No, no, no, no!

19:58.540 --> 20:01.380
(Fred yelling)

20:01.380 --> 20:04.170
(Fred gasps, groans)

20:08.250 --> 20:10.710
Fred:
Total eel move.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.210
It actually was.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.210
Some kind of
electric eel
mutation.

20:15.210 --> 20:17.620
Fine. Yes.
Fred was right.
Let's move on.

20:19.080 --> 20:21.790
There's someone
out there doing this
crazy bio-engineering.

20:21.790 --> 20:24.790
Yeah. First we saw it
with Orso Knox.

20:24.790 --> 20:27.380
And now High Voltage?

20:27.380 --> 20:29.210
Aah! Megan!

20:29.210 --> 20:31.790
(screaming)

20:31.790 --> 20:34.290
Hiro, can you believe
what just happened?

20:34.290 --> 20:37.290
2Super-villains,
at a high school dance.
This is not normal.

20:37.290 --> 20:39.000
-Ah, for you, maybe.
-What?

20:39.000 --> 20:42.170
-Who can say
what's normal, right?
-(sirens blaring)

20:43.580 --> 20:46.250
-(tires screech)
-Megan, are you all right?

20:46.250 --> 20:48.540
-I'm fine, Dad.
-Uh, Dad?

20:49.670 --> 20:51.290
Get statements.

20:51.290 --> 20:55.000
So, when you said your dad
had the police force looking
for you, you--

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
He ordered it.
He's the new
chief of police.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.170
Dad, everything's okay.
Big Hero 6 was here.

21:00.170 --> 21:02.620
(scoffs)
Superheroes.

21:02.620 --> 21:04.540
You don't like
superheroes?

21:04.540 --> 21:06.540
-Who are you?
-Dad, this is Hiro.

21:06.540 --> 21:09.210
Yeah, your aunt runs
the Lucky Cat.

21:09.210 --> 21:11.960
-Nice to meet you, Hiro.
-Uh, nice to meet you, too.

21:11.960 --> 21:15.080
-Why do you hate superheroes?
-You mean the vigilantes?

21:15.080 --> 21:17.290
No city with a skilled
police force needs 'em.

21:17.290 --> 21:18.920
A problem I plan to correct.

21:21.500 --> 21:23.540
(slithering)

21:27.710 --> 21:30.080
(shrieking)

21:34.670 --> 21:36.670
(theme music playing)
