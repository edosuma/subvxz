02:00.747 --> 02:02.697
All right,
Kensi just pulled in behind me,

02:02.699 --> 02:03.966
blaring My Chemical Romance,

02:03.968 --> 02:06.168
which means she is not
her cheery, chipper self,

02:06.170 --> 02:08.387
so I think we should
probably just play it cool.

02:08.389 --> 02:09.871
Deeks, I always play it cool.

02:09.872 --> 02:11.473
I'm actually playing aloof,

02:11.475 --> 02:13.675
which is the antisocial version
of cool.

02:13.677 --> 02:15.427
Okay, so, if I'm cool,

02:15.429 --> 02:17.346
and you're aloof,
what does that make you?

02:17.348 --> 02:18.480
Enigmatic?

02:18.482 --> 02:20.682
No, no, Hetty is enigmatic.

02:20.684 --> 02:22.317
You are...

02:22.319 --> 02:23.769
Charming... handsome...
Puerile.

02:23.771 --> 02:26.555
Otiose.
It means pointless.

02:31.361 --> 02:32.861
What?

02:32.863 --> 02:34.746
What? Nothing. We were just...

02:34.748 --> 02:35.998
Nothing.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.916
He thinks you're in a bad mood.

02:37.918 --> 02:40.252
And we're supposed
to play it cool.

02:40.254 --> 02:41.920
I'm actually playing it aloof.

02:41.922 --> 02:43.589
Thanks, guys.
Good looking out.

02:45.675 --> 02:48.293
Well, if you must know,

02:48.295 --> 02:50.262
I've killed another house plant.

02:50.264 --> 02:52.347
That is 14 since July.

02:52.349 --> 02:53.915
Wait. That's it?

02:53.917 --> 02:56.101
That's the source
of your sourness?

02:56.103 --> 02:57.136
It was a cactus.

02:58.421 --> 03:01.023
You killed something
that thrives in Death Valley?

03:01.858 --> 03:03.942
I went back
to get another one,

03:03.944 --> 03:05.861
but, oh, the guy cut me off.

03:05.863 --> 03:08.780
He actually took my picture
to put it behind the register.

03:09.950 --> 03:11.817
You have a mug shot
at the nursery?

03:11.819 --> 03:13.318
For crimes committed
against cacti?

03:13.320 --> 03:15.487
She is a serial
plant killer.

03:15.489 --> 03:17.272
Ignore them.
It's not your fault.

03:17.274 --> 03:18.773
No, I'm pretty sure
it's her fault.

03:18.775 --> 03:20.325
Well, not unless it was suicide.

03:20.327 --> 03:21.827
Did you photograph
the crime scene?

03:21.829 --> 03:23.295
Why would you guys
make me feel this way?

03:23.297 --> 03:24.546
It's the job.

03:24.548 --> 03:26.948
If you worked behind a desk
and had normal hours,

03:26.950 --> 03:28.967
all of those plants
would be alive.

03:28.969 --> 03:30.636
Probably.

03:30.638 --> 03:32.421
Yeah, it's the job.

03:33.591 --> 03:35.390
Yeah, we have
to give up certain things

03:35.392 --> 03:36.925
to do what we do, you know.

03:36.927 --> 03:38.310
Right.

03:38.312 --> 03:40.462
Like my dream
of home-grown oregano.

03:40.464 --> 03:42.097
You don't even cook.

03:42.099 --> 03:44.132
I would
if I had homegrown oregano.

03:44.134 --> 03:46.268
Yeah, I suppose
if I worked 9:00 to 5:00,

03:46.270 --> 03:49.938
my evenings would open up...

03:52.358 --> 03:54.409
Are you okay?

03:54.411 --> 03:56.945
Eric, do you need help?

03:56.947 --> 03:59.498
No, no, no. I think this
is like a Harry Potter deal.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.500
No, no.
I'm all over this. I know

04:01.502 --> 04:03.202
what you're doing.
You're doing charades.

04:03.204 --> 04:04.486
And I'm awesome at this.

04:04.488 --> 04:06.121
You're pulling up
by your hands

04:06.123 --> 04:08.290
'cause you're getting ready
to milk a cow.

04:08.292 --> 04:10.659
But it's just one udder
of a cow, and it's sideways.

04:10.661 --> 04:12.844
You're milking a sideways cow.
You're really milking the...

04:12.846 --> 04:14.129
No, we got a case.

04:14.131 --> 04:16.014
This is a lasso.
I'm throwing it,

04:16.016 --> 04:18.300
and I'm roping
y'all up to Ops.

04:18.302 --> 04:19.635
That was a lasso?

04:19.637 --> 04:21.670
I'm trying to figure out
what a cow has to do with it.

04:21.672 --> 04:22.789
I mean, 'cause
used both hands--

04:22.790 --> 04:23.923
I'm taking a mime class.

04:23.925 --> 04:25.625
Well, actually,
I'm watching a lot

04:25.627 --> 04:27.093
of YouTube videos about miming.

04:27.095 --> 04:28.344
Look, check this out. Look.

04:28.346 --> 04:29.929
I got a wall.

04:29.931 --> 04:31.380
I'm in a box.

04:31.382 --> 04:34.383
Whoa, the box is
closing in on me! Aah!

04:34.385 --> 04:35.801
I can be a leaf.

04:35.803 --> 04:37.419
I can be in
a windstorm.

04:37.421 --> 04:38.521
I can do a kite.

04:38.523 --> 04:40.422
I can do a kite
in a windstorm.

04:40.424 --> 04:43.809
Aah! Ooh! I can
do an escalator.

04:43.811 --> 04:45.427
- I can do a spiral stair...
- Stop.

04:45.429 --> 04:47.730
Mimes don't talk.
Stay in character.

04:47.732 --> 04:48.948
Go Method.

04:48.950 --> 04:51.651
Nice work.
Thank you.

04:51.653 --> 04:54.487
Okay, uh, these are
the photos taken outside

04:54.489 --> 04:56.355
the L.A. County Morgue's
Office last night.

04:56.357 --> 04:57.940
The man killed
was Stuart Westridge,

04:57.942 --> 04:59.608
a private investigator.

04:59.610 --> 05:01.844
Do we have eyes
on what happened?

05:01.846 --> 05:03.445
Uh, no cameras on the street.

05:03.447 --> 05:04.547
And the morgue hasn't released

05:04.549 --> 05:06.415
its closed circuit video feed
to us yet.

05:06.417 --> 05:09.301
Private investigator's going
to rack up a lot of enemies.

05:09.303 --> 05:12.338
The Navy has expressed interest
in one of his cases,

05:12.340 --> 05:15.558
commissioned by the widow
of a Marine.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.560
Lieutenant Edwin Prietto.

05:17.562 --> 05:19.562
He was killed in Afghanistan
two weeks ago.

05:19.564 --> 05:21.681
His wife Antonia
requested an autopsy report

05:21.683 --> 05:24.183
through the L.A. County
Morgue's Office,

05:24.185 --> 05:26.468
and hired Stuart Westridge
to investigate

05:26.470 --> 05:27.520
her husband's death.

05:27.522 --> 05:29.605
What does the operations report

05:29.607 --> 05:31.306
say about
Lieutenant Prietto's death?

05:31.308 --> 05:32.775
Um, not much.

05:32.777 --> 05:35.027
Just that he was killed
on the Pakistani border

05:35.029 --> 05:36.262
during a routine security sweep.

05:36.264 --> 05:38.447
It's like the Wild West
out there.

05:38.449 --> 05:40.499
Constant threat
of mortars, RPGs--

05:40.501 --> 05:41.984
last thing
anyone's thinking about

05:41.986 --> 05:43.869
is writing a detailed
operations report.

05:43.871 --> 05:46.756
That, or a convenient cover,
if you want to hide the truth.

05:53.080 --> 05:56.849
Mrs. Prietto, we are
deeply sorry for your loss.

05:56.851 --> 05:59.118
Thank you.
I'm fine.

06:01.772 --> 06:04.156
I don't know why
I just said that.

06:04.158 --> 06:06.675
I am anything but fine.

06:08.111 --> 06:11.947
I'm hurt, I'm upset,
I'm looking for answers.

06:13.817 --> 06:16.685
And I'm alone.

06:17.788 --> 06:19.371
I keep waiting

06:19.373 --> 06:20.906
for Edwin to call.

06:20.908 --> 06:22.491
Do you have any friends
or family

06:22.493 --> 06:23.709
that can help you through this?

06:23.711 --> 06:25.661
I joined a grief support group

06:25.663 --> 06:28.214
for the families
of fallen soldiers.

06:32.003 --> 06:34.870
I knew he was in harm's way,
but I was still convinced

06:34.872 --> 06:36.672
that Edwin would
come home to me.

06:36.674 --> 06:38.924
Well, it's normal
what you're feeling.

06:41.094 --> 06:43.378
Look, I have to ask,
Mrs. Prietto.

06:43.380 --> 06:44.680
Why are you suspicious

06:44.682 --> 06:46.899
about the events surrounding
your husband's death?

06:48.435 --> 06:50.385
The man from the Marines

06:50.387 --> 06:52.071
told me...
What man?

06:52.073 --> 06:54.389
The Casualty Assistance
something.

06:54.391 --> 06:56.325
Casualty Assistance
Calls Officer.

06:56.327 --> 06:57.226
Him.

06:57.228 --> 06:58.778
He kept saying

06:58.780 --> 07:01.230
that Edwin died
near the Pakistani border,

07:01.232 --> 07:03.749
but I that know
he was stationed in Kandahar.

07:03.751 --> 07:06.401
He called me from there
the day before he died.

07:06.403 --> 07:09.238
I tried to talk to
somebody else at the office

07:09.240 --> 07:11.874
to confirm, but it felt like
they were stonewalling me.

07:11.876 --> 07:14.460
So you hired Stuart Westridge
to investigate it.

07:14.462 --> 07:16.912
And now he's dead, too.

07:20.383 --> 07:22.802
The worst part of
all this is that...

07:22.804 --> 07:25.554
I haven't seen my
husband's body.

07:25.556 --> 07:29.608
I don't even know the results
of the autopsy yet.

07:29.610 --> 07:31.894
We can help you
with that, ma'am.

07:31.896 --> 07:33.979
Thank you.

07:37.284 --> 07:39.268
Thank you, Tony.

07:39.270 --> 07:41.370
You want to, uh...?

07:42.906 --> 07:44.156
What are you squinting at?

07:44.158 --> 07:46.242
Time for some
granny glasses?

07:46.244 --> 07:48.627
No, I'm trying to visualize
what you'd look like

07:48.629 --> 07:50.462
behind a desk,
as a public defender.

07:50.464 --> 07:52.581
Okay.
Clean-shaven, short hair.

07:52.583 --> 07:54.383
I looked exactly like this.

07:54.385 --> 07:55.918
Like this?!
Yup.

07:55.920 --> 07:58.554
Clients actually put their lives
in the hands of... this?

07:58.556 --> 08:01.223
Okay, first off, I was
very good at my job.

08:01.225 --> 08:02.675
Says you.

08:02.677 --> 08:04.376
Secondly, my clients
were assigned to me,

08:04.378 --> 08:05.594
so they didn't really
have a choice.

08:05.596 --> 08:07.129
Oh, I know the feeling.

08:07.131 --> 08:08.814
And thirdly...
Third.

08:08.816 --> 08:10.465
Thirdly, everyone knows

08:10.467 --> 08:13.468
that public defenders are the
rebel of the legal profession.

08:13.470 --> 08:17.806
Rebel without
a due process clause? Ha!

08:17.808 --> 08:20.309
Kensi just made a legal funny?
Is that what that was?

08:20.311 --> 08:22.278
How you feeling right now?
Pretty proud of yourself?

08:22.280 --> 08:23.495
You know what?
I'll give it to you.

08:23.497 --> 08:25.080
Touché.

08:25.082 --> 08:26.949
Touché!
Yeah.

08:30.653 --> 08:32.404
Wow.

08:36.342 --> 08:37.659
Whoever killed Stuart Westridge

08:37.660 --> 08:40.429
hit his jugular
and both carotid arteries.

08:40.431 --> 08:43.799
Either they got lucky, or

08:43.801 --> 08:45.684
they knew exactly
what they were doing.

08:45.686 --> 08:47.186
Yeah, he bled out immediately.

08:47.188 --> 08:48.721
Didn't even have a chance
to call for help.

08:48.723 --> 08:51.140
Yeah, certainly not
with a severed windpipe.

08:51.142 --> 08:54.059
LAPD tested.
No fibers, no fingerprints.

08:54.061 --> 08:55.561
Car came up clean.

08:55.563 --> 08:57.062
Which means

08:57.064 --> 08:59.848
the person
who did this came prepared.

08:59.850 --> 09:02.117
Police did find his
gun and his wallet.

09:02.119 --> 09:04.286
So robbery wasn't a motive.

09:04.288 --> 09:06.021
Killer was a pro.

09:06.023 --> 09:08.941
Motivation is somehow connected
to Lieutenant Prietto.

09:11.628 --> 09:14.997
Deeks, what if the Marine Corps
is trying to cover something up?

09:18.084 --> 09:20.219
Rose.

09:20.221 --> 09:21.553
Thanks for meeting with us.

09:21.555 --> 09:23.505
Of course.

09:23.507 --> 09:26.208
But Mrs. Prietto,
this won't be easy

09:26.210 --> 09:27.927
for you to see.

09:27.929 --> 09:31.030
I understand.
Is that him?

09:47.113 --> 09:50.249
Did you perform
the autopsy?

09:50.251 --> 09:51.417
No, but I can tell you...

09:51.419 --> 09:52.534
I would like to speak

09:52.536 --> 09:53.836
to the person
that performed the autopsy.

09:53.838 --> 09:55.254
Of course.

09:57.040 --> 10:00.676
It... doesn't weigh anything.

10:00.678 --> 10:02.628
Oh, yes.

10:02.630 --> 10:05.264
Bone and tissue account
for much of our body weight.

10:05.266 --> 10:08.968
Once they've been removed,
we become significantly lighter.

10:11.688 --> 10:13.639
Antonia, do you
need to sit down?

10:13.641 --> 10:15.524
What do you mean,
"Once they've been removed?"

10:15.526 --> 10:17.309
For the tissue donation.

10:17.311 --> 10:21.030
My husband
wasn't a tissue donor.

10:21.032 --> 10:22.731
He must have been.

10:22.733 --> 10:25.034
Is this something
you two discussed?

10:25.036 --> 10:27.436
Yes. He would never
have done that.

10:27.438 --> 10:30.572
May I?

10:34.711 --> 10:36.912
Bone's been replaced.

10:37.914 --> 10:39.999
With PVC pipe probably.

10:40.001 --> 10:41.500
Yeah.

10:41.502 --> 10:43.452
So it looks like
nothing happened to him.

10:43.454 --> 10:44.786
Then they
removed the skin,

10:44.788 --> 10:46.055
but only underneath the arm.

10:46.057 --> 10:47.622
Rose, was there
anything else removed?

10:47.624 --> 10:49.308
Uh, I don't have his file...
Stop.

10:49.310 --> 10:51.560
Just... stop.

10:51.562 --> 10:52.961
Now do you understand

10:52.963 --> 10:55.014
why I know
the Marine Corps is lying to me

10:55.016 --> 10:56.265
about where he died?

10:56.267 --> 10:58.067
Mrs. Prietto, we don't know
what this means yet.

10:58.069 --> 10:59.318
Well, I do.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.937
The Marines had the morgue strip
my husband's body,

11:01.939 --> 11:05.124
so that they could hide what
happened to him in Afghanistan.

11:17.237 --> 11:19.480
Rose, explain to me
how this could have happened.

11:19.481 --> 11:21.314
How could a morgue
remove tissue

11:21.316 --> 11:23.149
from someone who
didn't consent?

11:23.151 --> 11:24.784
I have no idea.

11:24.786 --> 11:26.286
We wouldn't
have done it without it.

11:26.288 --> 11:29.122
Tissue doesn't have
the same time frame as organs,

11:29.124 --> 11:31.157
and that's why it's performed
in a morgue,

11:31.159 --> 11:33.944
but only when the deceased
is a donor.

11:35.247 --> 11:36.279
Ian.

11:36.281 --> 11:38.781
These NCIS agents
have some questions

11:38.783 --> 11:41.784
about the prep you did
on Lieutenant Edwin Prietto.

11:41.786 --> 11:43.953
The Marine from a few days ago?

11:43.955 --> 11:46.773
Walk us through what you did
to Lieutenant Prietto's body.

11:46.775 --> 11:50.343
Um... I performed an autopsy,

11:50.345 --> 11:53.179
I extracted his tissue,
and then...

11:53.181 --> 11:55.265
cleaned and prepped him
for the funeral home.

11:55.267 --> 11:57.317
He's as meticulous as they come.

11:57.319 --> 11:59.486
He would have
never removed tissue

11:59.488 --> 12:01.571
unless the paperwork ordered it.

12:01.573 --> 12:05.458
I thought
I was following his wishes.

12:05.460 --> 12:07.827
Show us
Lieutenant Prietto's paperwork.

12:20.591 --> 12:22.676
His file was just here
yesterday.

12:22.678 --> 12:25.378
I-It listed him
as a donor, I swear.

12:25.380 --> 12:26.930
Look...

12:26.932 --> 12:29.182
No, you have to believe him.

12:29.184 --> 12:31.768
Someone must
have taken it.

12:32.836 --> 12:34.637
We got access to the morgue's
security footage?

12:34.639 --> 12:38.191
Yep. This is Westridge
breaking in.

12:41.345 --> 12:44.114
And then, two minutes later...

12:46.934 --> 12:49.202
Must be Lieutenant
Prietto's missing file.

12:49.204 --> 12:50.954
LAPD didn't find it
in Stuart Westridge's car.

12:50.956 --> 12:52.472
Which means
the killer took it.

12:52.474 --> 12:54.491
But why?

12:54.493 --> 12:56.710
Ah, the million dollar question.

12:56.712 --> 12:57.844
Nate.

12:57.846 --> 12:59.546
How are you?
Good.

12:59.548 --> 13:01.631
Good to see you, man.
You, too.

13:01.633 --> 13:03.583
Give me a hug. Hey.

13:04.418 --> 13:07.387
Hi, Nate.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.206
So... how are you guys?

13:10.208 --> 13:12.175
We're great.
What brings you to town?

13:12.177 --> 13:14.344
I'm actually here
Hetty's request.

13:16.781 --> 13:18.114
For what case?

13:18.116 --> 13:20.150
Nothing specific.

13:20.985 --> 13:22.986
Oh, no.
Come on.

13:22.988 --> 13:24.988
What? What?

13:24.990 --> 13:26.156
Semiannual
psych evaluation.

13:26.158 --> 13:27.640
For him or for us?

13:27.642 --> 13:29.275
For him. I'm fine.

13:29.277 --> 13:31.177
Me, too. Never better.

13:31.179 --> 13:33.046
I'm glad to hear it.
How about you, Kensi?

13:33.048 --> 13:34.697
Really good.

13:34.699 --> 13:36.916
Well, I promise
it will be painless.

13:36.918 --> 13:38.485
Sorry, Nate. G and I

13:38.487 --> 13:40.086
have to go, uh,
interview a CACO officer.

13:40.088 --> 13:42.205
Right now.

13:42.207 --> 13:44.240
Yeah, we have to go
search this place--

13:44.242 --> 13:46.709
the dead investigator's
house... yeah.

13:46.711 --> 13:49.012
See ya.

13:49.014 --> 13:51.214
I'm not the enemy, you know!

13:53.184 --> 13:54.684
They're a special bunch.

13:54.686 --> 13:56.803
Kind of tough to
get through, but...

13:56.805 --> 13:58.888
Oh, well...
One of these days.

13:58.890 --> 14:00.273
What's going on
with you two?

14:00.275 --> 14:02.275
What's-what's up?
Nell and I kissed.

14:03.760 --> 14:07.697
This is... not happening.

14:07.699 --> 14:09.649
I'm, uh, just

14:09.651 --> 14:12.986
pretty sure that it was just
to get me in a pair of tights.

14:12.988 --> 14:14.821
Just want to put it
out there, let you know.

14:14.823 --> 14:16.039
Right.

14:16.041 --> 14:17.807
<i>Preliminary report</i>

14:17.809 --> 14:21.494
on Mr. Westridge said that LAPD
didn't find anything here.

14:21.496 --> 14:23.329
Well, maybe they
overlooked something.

14:23.331 --> 14:25.215
Why? What do you got?

14:25.217 --> 14:27.717
Holy Dewey Decimal System.
Looks like every

14:27.719 --> 14:29.636
case Westridge ever worked on.

14:29.638 --> 14:31.958
That's a lot of secrets
for one man to keep.

14:31.983 --> 14:33.127
Mm.

14:34.558 --> 14:37.594
And it looked like he used
to have even more.

14:37.596 --> 14:40.129
Antonia Prietto's file-- empty.

14:40.131 --> 14:42.649
Okay, so, there's no signs
of a forced entry,

14:42.651 --> 14:44.967
which means whoever killed
Stuart stole his keys,

14:44.969 --> 14:46.519
made his way over to his house,

14:46.521 --> 14:48.905
and took the Prietto file
before LAPD showed up.

14:48.907 --> 14:50.857
Along with his computer.

14:50.859 --> 14:53.276
Well, maybe he was using one
of those cloud storage drives

14:53.278 --> 14:56.613
or a-a backup thumb drive,
which means, if we find that,

14:56.615 --> 14:57.947
we can figure out
what he was working on.

14:57.949 --> 14:59.782
- You know what this calls for?
- What?

15:01.119 --> 15:02.952
What are you doing?

15:02.954 --> 15:05.839
Last time I did this,
I almost found a nuclear bomb.

15:12.513 --> 15:14.347
Are you kidding me?

15:18.336 --> 15:19.969
You know what this is,
Kensalina?

15:19.971 --> 15:25.225
Wireless hard drive,
hidden... in plain sight.

15:31.615 --> 15:34.651
Mr. Getz.
Hetty.

15:34.653 --> 15:37.353
Thank you for inviting me back.
Oh, pish.

15:37.355 --> 15:39.289
You know you're
more than welcome

15:39.291 --> 15:41.105
whenever you're
in this time zone.

15:41.130 --> 15:42.092
Mm-hmm.

15:42.093 --> 15:44.160
So, what's the real reason
I'm here?

15:44.162 --> 15:45.545
I mean, we both know it's not

15:45.547 --> 15:47.997
to conduct mental health
checkups on the team.

15:47.999 --> 15:50.884
Hmm. I thought
that was plausible.

15:50.886 --> 15:52.418
Okay.

15:52.420 --> 15:55.037
So I'm just a pawn in your game.

15:55.039 --> 15:56.339
Well, I'm gonna

15:56.341 --> 15:58.558
figure out exactly
what that game is.

15:58.560 --> 16:01.978
Oh, don't you underestimate
the value of a pawn.

16:01.980 --> 16:03.396
He's a soldier.

16:04.214 --> 16:06.065
That was Mikhail's...

16:06.067 --> 16:07.400
Achilles' heel.

16:07.402 --> 16:09.235
M-Mikhail?

16:09.237 --> 16:10.853
Gorbachev.

16:10.855 --> 16:14.691
We had a standing game in
Moscow, whenever I was there.

16:14.693 --> 16:17.327
Sometimes I let him win.

16:17.329 --> 16:19.395
That was to help the Cold War...

16:19.397 --> 16:21.197
stay cold.

16:22.032 --> 16:23.866
Can't I at least be a rook?

16:23.868 --> 16:25.868
Maybe like a... knight?

16:25.870 --> 16:27.170
Something cool?

16:27.172 --> 16:28.871
Someday.

16:28.873 --> 16:30.873
But today...

16:30.875 --> 16:33.793
you're my very tall pawn,

16:33.795 --> 16:36.012
Mr. Getz.

16:42.303 --> 16:44.220
Maybe a bishop?

16:44.222 --> 16:45.921
You presented
Lieutenant Prietto's

16:45.923 --> 16:47.941
initial death notification
to his widow?

16:47.943 --> 16:49.976
Yes, sir.
You told her

16:49.978 --> 16:52.111
he was killed somewhere
on the Pakistani border?

16:52.113 --> 16:53.613
That's what was in the report.

16:53.615 --> 16:55.365
Do you have a copy
of the paperwork

16:55.367 --> 16:56.783
that was sent to the morgue?

17:00.371 --> 17:05.107
You notice anything unusual
about Lieutenant Prietto's case?

17:05.108 --> 17:07.242
No, sir.

17:07.244 --> 17:09.662
Says here he was a tissue donor.

17:09.664 --> 17:12.714
Do you know when
he filled this out?

17:12.717 --> 17:15.550
Not for sure, but we
recently changed that form.

17:15.553 --> 17:19.088
So he must have filled it out
a few months ago.

17:20.257 --> 17:22.425
Maybe Prietto
had a change of heart.

17:22.426 --> 17:23.476
Yeah, but why not tell his wife

17:23.478 --> 17:25.645
if he know how important
it was to her?

17:27.897 --> 17:29.315
Thank you, Captain.

17:29.317 --> 17:31.601
We'll let you know if
we need anything else.

17:31.603 --> 17:33.069
Yes, sir.

17:33.071 --> 17:35.271
Thanks.
Sir.

17:41.978 --> 17:45.081
You think the wife knows
something she's not telling us?

17:45.083 --> 17:49.252
The body of an American Marine
was desecrated on our own soil.

17:49.254 --> 17:51.421
Then a man was killed
investigating it.

17:51.423 --> 17:53.923
Somebody's definitely
hiding something.

17:54.876 --> 17:56.158
Guys, you need to see this.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.044
This hit the air
five minutes ago.

17:58.046 --> 18:01.464
This is Kent Shocknek,
live in Los Angeles,

18:01.466 --> 18:03.599
where a veterans support group
has informed us

18:03.601 --> 18:05.601
that the body
of Lieutenant Edwin Prietto,

18:05.603 --> 18:07.002
killed in Afghanistan,

18:07.004 --> 18:09.004
was harvested for tissue at
the Los Angeles County Morgue.

18:09.006 --> 18:11.006
His widow claims the Marines

18:11.008 --> 18:13.192
ordered the extraction
to hide the true cause

18:13.194 --> 18:14.277
of her husband's death.

18:14.279 --> 18:16.229
A Navy spokesperson commented,
only to say

18:16.231 --> 18:17.847
they are looking
into the matter.

18:17.849 --> 18:19.181
Now, back to you.

18:19.183 --> 18:20.783
Antonia went public
with her story.

18:20.785 --> 18:23.036
So much for keeping
a lid on this.

18:23.904 --> 18:25.354
This is bad, G.

18:25.356 --> 18:28.041
We're either dealing
with a distraught widow

18:28.043 --> 18:29.659
who's looking for answers

18:29.661 --> 18:32.912
or a woman
with a whole other agenda.

18:42.132 --> 18:44.166
Yes.

18:44.168 --> 18:46.185
Yes, of course, Owen.

18:46.187 --> 18:47.720
Granger?

18:47.722 --> 18:50.056
You're absolutely right.

18:50.058 --> 18:51.724
And Hetty's being nice?

18:51.726 --> 18:53.676
Bye for now.

18:57.064 --> 18:59.482
Hetty's always nice.

18:59.484 --> 19:03.069
Granger, on the other hand,
is having a conniption.

19:03.071 --> 19:06.522
Evidently this news
of Lieutenant Prietto

19:06.524 --> 19:10.859
is rapidly turning into
a public relations nightmare.

19:10.861 --> 19:12.879
So what do you want to do now?

19:12.881 --> 19:16.098
Well, I think we have to find
out what the hell happened.

19:16.100 --> 19:17.383
We found something.

19:17.385 --> 19:19.385
Well, technically,
Nate suggested it,

19:19.387 --> 19:22.037
I researched it, and Eric
hacked the database but...

19:22.039 --> 19:24.590
Lieutenant Prietto's unit is
still in combat in Afghanistan,

19:24.592 --> 19:27.493
but another Marine was
injured the day he died.

19:27.495 --> 19:30.513
He's recuperating at the
V.A. hospital here in Westwood.

19:30.515 --> 19:32.765
He may be able to shed light on
what really happened over there.

19:32.767 --> 19:34.517
Let's have Kensi and Deeks
pay him a visit.

19:34.519 --> 19:36.319
We should go back
and talk to Ian Bruckhurst,

19:36.321 --> 19:37.720
find the results
of that autopsy.

19:37.722 --> 19:39.105
Why don't you two
work with Eric?

19:39.107 --> 19:40.439
See if this has ever
happened before.

19:40.441 --> 19:42.525
Ticktock.

19:42.527 --> 19:43.181
Ticktock.

19:43.206 --> 19:45.393
Time to put
a little pressure on Ian.

19:47.164 --> 19:49.365
Hey, Callen, wait up.

19:50.617 --> 19:53.068
You got a minute
to check in?

19:53.070 --> 19:54.537
How are things?

19:54.539 --> 19:56.539
Good. Good.

19:56.541 --> 19:58.424
How are...
things with you, Nate?

19:58.426 --> 20:01.410
Great.
It's really good being back.

20:01.412 --> 20:04.547
But, well, now that I'm not
around so much anymore,

20:04.549 --> 20:07.633
I just wanted to make sure
you had someone to... talk to.

20:07.635 --> 20:09.302
You and me both.

20:09.304 --> 20:11.137
So you do want
someone to talk to.

20:11.139 --> 20:12.588
You know what
I really want?

20:12.590 --> 20:15.274
I want to meet somebody.

20:15.276 --> 20:17.426
How did you do it?

20:17.428 --> 20:18.861
How...?

20:18.863 --> 20:21.864
Well, it's not really my area
of expertise, but, um...

20:21.866 --> 20:24.150
I like to lay a foundation
first, you know?

20:24.152 --> 20:26.235
Get to know them
as a friend.

20:26.237 --> 20:28.037
That's exactly what I told him.

20:28.039 --> 20:31.157
But how long, you know,
before you ask her out?

20:31.159 --> 20:33.442
Oh, well, that depends.

20:33.444 --> 20:35.161
Well, this time,
for instance.

20:35.163 --> 20:37.546
This one was tricky--
it was, like...

20:37.548 --> 20:39.165
three years.

20:39.167 --> 20:41.634
Mm-hmm.
Wow.

20:41.636 --> 20:44.003
I don't think I'd really have
the patience for that.

20:44.005 --> 20:46.138
He really doesn't. Three years?

20:46.140 --> 20:47.890
When she's the right one...

20:47.892 --> 20:48.957
you will.

20:48.959 --> 20:50.959
That's great.

20:50.961 --> 20:52.728
Nate, thanks for the talk.

20:52.730 --> 20:55.097
All right.
Thanks, guys.

20:55.099 --> 20:57.099
And the psychologist
becomes the patient.

20:57.101 --> 21:00.269
He never knew what hit him
until it was already over.

21:01.104 --> 21:03.856
I hate it when he does that.

21:03.858 --> 21:06.926
Sergeant Charles, thank you
so much for talking with us.

21:06.928 --> 21:08.828
If you need a break,
just let us know.

21:08.830 --> 21:10.629
Oh, trust me,
I enjoy the company.

21:10.631 --> 21:13.449
All I wanted in Afghanistan
was some privacy, but...

21:13.451 --> 21:15.868
now that I'm here,
I'll talk to anybody.

21:15.870 --> 21:18.788
Nurses all think I
got crushes on 'em.

21:18.790 --> 21:20.456
Nothing wrong with that.
No.

21:20.458 --> 21:22.666
So, what can you tell us
about the day you were wounded?

21:22.772 --> 21:23.825
Not much.

21:23.845 --> 21:26.012
My memory's spotty.
Doc says, uh,

21:26.014 --> 21:28.997
it's 'cause of the head injury
and that it'll come back, but...

21:28.999 --> 21:32.018
I wouldn't mind if I blocked
the whole thing out for good.

21:32.020 --> 21:34.220
Do you remember
how Lieutenant Prietto died?

21:38.058 --> 21:40.676
Sergeant, you okay?

21:40.678 --> 21:42.812
Yeah, uh...

21:42.814 --> 21:45.031
I didn't realize Lieutenant
Prietto didn't make it.

21:45.033 --> 21:46.849
He was a good guy.

21:46.851 --> 21:48.784
I'm sorry.

21:49.853 --> 21:51.620
Do you remember anything
about your mission?

21:51.622 --> 21:52.872
What you guys were doing

21:52.874 --> 21:54.857
on the Pakistani border?

21:54.859 --> 21:57.126
Pakistan?

21:58.361 --> 22:00.496
Look, uh, I don't
remember much,

22:00.498 --> 22:02.882
but if the Marine Corps said
we were there,

22:02.884 --> 22:04.366
that's where we were.

22:04.368 --> 22:06.635
I think I'll take
that break now.

22:11.558 --> 22:13.993
I hit a nerve there.

22:13.995 --> 22:16.228
Ian, a few more questions
for you.

22:16.230 --> 22:18.898
Can it wait? I'm a
little busy right now.

22:18.900 --> 22:21.016
Only take a second.
All right.

22:23.403 --> 22:24.720
Hi.

22:24.722 --> 22:27.073
Does he have to stand
behind me like that?

22:27.075 --> 22:28.491
I do.

22:28.493 --> 22:29.892
He does.

22:29.894 --> 22:32.161
So, were you able
to determine the cause

22:32.163 --> 22:33.913
of Lieutenant Prietto's death
from your autopsy?

22:33.915 --> 22:36.832
Yes. It was a single
bullet wound.

22:36.834 --> 22:38.784
Entered under the left axilla,

22:38.786 --> 22:40.703
traversed
through the pericardium,

22:40.705 --> 22:42.455
severed his spinal cord.

22:42.457 --> 22:44.507
What can you tell us
about the bullet?

22:44.509 --> 22:46.425
Not much.

22:46.427 --> 22:49.178
Fragmented on impact
with his vertebrae.

22:49.180 --> 22:51.630
Probably impossible to trace
to a specific weapon.

22:51.632 --> 22:54.082
Or to know if that's
what actually killed him.

22:54.084 --> 22:55.918
Did you notice anything unusual

22:55.920 --> 22:58.270
about the way
Lieutenant Prietto died?

22:58.272 --> 23:00.255
Exposure to chemicals,

23:00.257 --> 23:02.108
substances in his bloodstream,
anything like that?

23:02.110 --> 23:03.609
No.

23:03.611 --> 23:05.311
His-his cause of
death was consistent

23:05.313 --> 23:06.612
with the Marine Corps'

23:06.614 --> 23:08.263
casualty report.

23:08.265 --> 23:09.982
Okay.

23:09.984 --> 23:12.952
Make sure Mrs. Prietto gets a
copy of your autopsy results.

23:12.954 --> 23:14.904
I will.

23:14.906 --> 23:19.375
And I'll also apologize
for whatever mistake was made.

23:19.377 --> 23:21.494
Okay.

23:36.810 --> 23:38.727
Good morning...

23:38.729 --> 23:42.181
and welcome to the Fairfield
Manor Funeral Home,

23:42.183 --> 23:44.066
where we acknowledge a life

23:44.068 --> 23:46.902
and cherish a memory.

23:46.904 --> 23:48.354
How can I help you?

23:48.356 --> 23:50.489
We would like to speak
to your director

23:50.491 --> 23:52.241
about Lieutenant Edwin Prietto.

23:52.243 --> 23:55.411
Please come with me.

23:57.030 --> 23:58.981
You can wait in here.

23:58.983 --> 24:03.586
Um, but don't touch anything,
for obvious reasons.

24:05.455 --> 24:08.207
I'll go get him now.

24:12.012 --> 24:14.013
Nothing creepy about

24:14.015 --> 24:16.048
this place at all.

24:16.050 --> 24:17.766
I think it's got character.

24:17.768 --> 24:18.934
Yeah. Pretty sure I saw

24:18.936 --> 24:21.187
that fountain in
the <i>Serial Killers Digest.</i>

24:22.607 --> 24:24.840
David Lerner?
Yes.

24:24.842 --> 24:26.275
I'm happy
to discuss Lieutenant Prietto,

24:26.277 --> 24:27.860
but we're still waiting
on his body.

24:27.862 --> 24:30.279
The Marines delivered him
directly to the morgue.

24:30.281 --> 24:32.815
But didn't Mrs. Prietto hire you
to arrange the burial?

24:32.817 --> 24:35.017
We have a relationship
with the CACO office

24:35.019 --> 24:36.869
because we offer
at-cost funerals

24:36.871 --> 24:39.321
for fallen servicemen
coming home to Los Angeles.

24:39.323 --> 24:42.291
Were you aware that Lieutenant
Prietto was a tissue donor?

24:42.293 --> 24:44.960
No, I was not.

24:44.962 --> 24:46.194
Hmm. We may have

24:46.196 --> 24:48.130
to do some additional cosmetic
work before the viewing.

24:48.132 --> 24:50.549
Well, apparently, Mrs. Prietto
wasn't aware of that, either.

24:50.551 --> 24:52.885
Ah. I see.

24:52.887 --> 24:56.371
It-It's entirely possible
he decided to become a donor

24:56.373 --> 24:59.058
after seeing his fellow
servicemen wounded in combat.

24:59.060 --> 25:01.227
Regardless, we will
do whatever we can

25:01.229 --> 25:04.046
to help Mrs. Prietto
through the grieving process.

25:04.048 --> 25:05.547
Thank you.

25:05.549 --> 25:07.850
We will contact you if we have
any further questions.

25:07.852 --> 25:10.052
Thank you so much.

25:12.022 --> 25:13.522
Eric, what's up?

25:13.524 --> 25:15.941
You've had the investigator's
hard drive for almost an hour.

25:15.943 --> 25:17.392
I'm sorry.

25:17.394 --> 25:20.079
Someone had some really pungent
sauerkraut for lunch,

25:20.081 --> 25:22.865
and it's throwing
me off my game.

25:22.867 --> 25:24.250
Okay, we're in.

25:24.252 --> 25:25.567
Good.

25:25.569 --> 25:28.087
All right, open the last folder
Stuart accessed.

25:28.089 --> 25:30.072
Let's see what
he was working on.

25:30.074 --> 25:33.125
He just updated
this one yesterday.

25:33.127 --> 25:36.128
Hours before he was killed.

25:36.130 --> 25:38.080
Those look like
surveillance photos.

25:38.082 --> 25:39.415
Eric, can you enlarge those?

25:40.585 --> 25:42.084
That's Rose.

25:42.086 --> 25:44.019
No, that-that can't be right.

25:44.021 --> 25:46.355
I mean, we know Rose, right?

25:46.357 --> 25:48.641
She's... she's a friend.

25:48.643 --> 25:51.226
Who just became a
person of interest.

26:05.426 --> 26:08.244
Hetty, we don't know what
these photos mean.

26:08.246 --> 26:11.564
Oh, except that a private
investigator, who's dead,

26:11.566 --> 26:13.232
was looking into Rose.

26:13.234 --> 26:15.101
He was hired to investigate
what happened

26:15.103 --> 26:17.036
to Lieutenant Prietto
in Afghanistan.

26:17.038 --> 26:18.688
Why would he be interested
in Rose?

26:18.690 --> 26:22.224
Maybe he thought that she was
responsible for harvesting

26:22.226 --> 26:24.226
Lieutenant Prietto's tissue.

26:24.228 --> 26:28.080
The only one way to be sure
is to ask her.

26:28.082 --> 26:30.733
Slow down, Mr. Callen.

26:30.735 --> 26:33.619
I think I'd like Mr. Getz
to take the lead in this.

26:33.621 --> 26:35.838
You want <i>me</i> to question Rose?

26:35.840 --> 26:37.573
But... I know her.

26:37.575 --> 26:39.041
Is-Isn't that a conflict?

26:39.043 --> 26:41.844
An NCIS agent will question
a person of interest.

26:41.846 --> 26:43.779
Nothing more.

26:43.781 --> 26:47.216
I don't know how comfortable
I am interrogating Rose.

26:47.218 --> 26:50.219
Now, that's your word,
Mr. Getz, not mine.

26:50.221 --> 26:52.254
Nate,

26:52.256 --> 26:55.307
the only way to clear her name
is to get answers.

26:55.309 --> 26:57.593
Just talk
to her like a friend.

27:01.231 --> 27:04.433
It's your move, Mr. Getz.

27:07.037 --> 27:09.739
I guess it's time
to play the pawn.

27:09.741 --> 27:12.074
You have your assignment.

27:17.097 --> 27:20.583
Is this the real reason
you brought in Nate?

27:20.585 --> 27:24.804
Mr. Hanna, you know
I don't kiss and tell.

27:24.806 --> 27:27.306
Hmm.

27:29.309 --> 27:32.845
Oh.

27:32.847 --> 27:34.880
So this is where
the magic happens.

27:36.150 --> 27:37.266
Something like that.

27:37.268 --> 27:40.969
Oh... Is anyone else here,
or is it just us?

27:40.971 --> 27:42.405
Ah.

27:42.407 --> 27:44.073
Or are we on camera?

27:44.075 --> 27:46.025
Wait, am I gonna meet Hetty?

27:46.027 --> 27:48.778
I-I doubt
you'll meet Hetty today.

27:48.780 --> 27:50.479
She's off...

27:50.481 --> 27:51.980
playing chess.

27:51.982 --> 27:53.749
Oh. Cool.

27:53.751 --> 27:54.867
Come here.

27:54.869 --> 27:57.653
Okay. Hmm.

27:57.655 --> 28:01.924
Oh, this is stark.

28:01.926 --> 28:04.343
Yeah.

28:04.345 --> 28:06.629
Oh...

28:06.631 --> 28:08.664
It's our interrogation room.

28:08.666 --> 28:10.683
So we're definitely
on camera now.

28:10.685 --> 28:12.384
Hi, Mom.

28:13.638 --> 28:16.272
Rose, could you please
take a seat for a minute?

28:16.274 --> 28:18.340
You're acting so formal.

28:18.342 --> 28:20.526
I need to ask you
a few questions.

28:20.528 --> 28:23.679
Questions like,
what's my favorite movie?

28:23.681 --> 28:25.064
Or questions like...

28:25.066 --> 28:27.900
"Where were you the evening
of November fourth?"

28:29.570 --> 28:31.654
Somewhere in between, but...

28:31.656 --> 28:34.206
a little closer
to the second one.

28:34.208 --> 28:35.875
What?!

28:35.877 --> 28:38.043
You...

28:41.248 --> 28:43.415
You're interrogating me?

28:44.801 --> 28:46.886
Nate, do you think
I had something to do

28:46.888 --> 28:48.370
with what happened
at the morgue?

28:48.372 --> 28:49.755
Please sit.

29:04.271 --> 29:06.438
What is this? Wha...?

29:07.607 --> 29:09.692
Where did you get these?

29:09.694 --> 29:11.160
These photographs were taken

29:11.162 --> 29:14.029
by the investigator
Antonia Prietto hired...

29:14.031 --> 29:16.081
who's now dead.

29:16.083 --> 29:18.066
Well, um...

29:18.068 --> 29:20.669
why am I
in these pictures?

29:21.454 --> 29:24.239
I was hoping you
could tell me that.

29:30.297 --> 29:32.715
Huh. So...

29:32.717 --> 29:35.083
this is Rose's place.

29:35.085 --> 29:37.970
I would've thought
it would be more flowery.

29:37.972 --> 29:39.688
I feel icky
just being here.

29:39.690 --> 29:41.590
She's our friend.

29:41.592 --> 29:43.776
How do you think
Nate feels?

29:47.564 --> 29:50.449
Have you ever had to interrogate
someone you're close to?

29:50.451 --> 29:51.817
Oh, yeah.

29:51.819 --> 29:53.285
One time,
there was this, uh...

29:53.287 --> 29:55.204
this banker-- she was wearing
this sweet pantsuit.

29:55.206 --> 29:57.623
Very repressed,
but I got her to, uh...

29:57.625 --> 29:59.625
Not talking about role playing.

29:59.627 --> 30:01.126
Oh.
Oh.

30:02.997 --> 30:04.613
Kens?
Yeah.

30:04.615 --> 30:06.615
It's gonna be fine. It's Rose.

30:06.617 --> 30:08.167
I know.

30:08.169 --> 30:10.169
And the investigator
was probably going

30:10.171 --> 30:12.588
to tail everybody that
works at the morgue anyway.

30:12.590 --> 30:14.306
Exactly. This is just
a formality.

30:20.230 --> 30:21.764
Deeks?

30:21.766 --> 30:23.349
Yeah?

30:23.351 --> 30:25.968
I found Lieutenant
Prietto's morgue file.

30:30.106 --> 30:32.658
Hello, Rose.

30:36.496 --> 30:38.447
You found it!

30:38.449 --> 30:40.315
Yeah.
On your dining room table.

30:40.317 --> 30:42.251
What?!

30:42.253 --> 30:44.336
Well, I don't know
how it got there.

30:44.338 --> 30:46.622
Please tell me you can give us
something better than that.

30:46.624 --> 30:48.674
Callen, I had nothing to do

30:48.676 --> 30:50.876
with preparing
Lieutenant Prietto's body.

30:50.878 --> 30:53.963
There's no reason
his file would be in my house.

30:53.965 --> 30:57.016
Wait-- you went
through my house?!

30:59.136 --> 31:01.971
You brought me here so
they could go through my stuff?

31:01.973 --> 31:03.272
Rose, it's not like that.

31:03.274 --> 31:05.007
It's just...
What?

31:05.009 --> 31:06.809
It's my job.

31:06.811 --> 31:08.844
If you had nothing to do with

31:08.846 --> 31:11.530
Lieutenant Prietto, why'd
you sign his paperwork?

31:11.532 --> 31:12.815
I didn't process this,

31:12.817 --> 31:16.201
and-and that is not
my signature.

31:16.203 --> 31:18.420
Look, Nate...

31:20.291 --> 31:22.024
Here's the receipt
for Sprinkles.

31:22.026 --> 31:23.375
Sprinkles?

31:23.377 --> 31:25.494
It's a cupcake place.

31:25.496 --> 31:27.362
Nate took me
to dinner last night,

31:27.364 --> 31:30.198
so I treated for dessert.

31:30.200 --> 31:34.053
Can I see
your driver's license?

31:40.810 --> 31:42.811
She's telling the truth.

31:42.813 --> 31:44.763
It-It's pretty
close, but...

31:44.765 --> 31:46.665
that is not her signature
on this file.

31:49.653 --> 31:51.403
Eric and Nell found something.

31:58.745 --> 32:01.613
Eric, you want to tell 'em
what you found?

32:01.615 --> 32:02.865
Nell and I combed

32:02.867 --> 32:05.067
through the County Morgue
files, like you asked.

32:05.069 --> 32:07.369
In the last 18 months,
there's been a spike

32:07.371 --> 32:08.787
in the number of tissue donors.

32:08.789 --> 32:10.255
They weren't all military,

32:10.257 --> 32:12.341
but each one was disease-free
when they died,

32:12.343 --> 32:15.594
and buried by the Fairfield
Manor Funeral Home.

32:15.596 --> 32:17.129
And Ian Bruckhurst's name

32:17.131 --> 32:19.882
is on all their morgue
transfer orders.

32:19.884 --> 32:22.417
So Ian and the funeral
home were working together.

32:22.419 --> 32:23.802
Yeah, stealing tissue
from dead bodies,

32:23.804 --> 32:24.937
and then turning around

32:24.939 --> 32:26.388
and selling them
on the black market.

32:26.390 --> 32:28.674
And Lieutenant Prietto
wasn't the only one.

32:37.928 --> 32:40.713
Eric, I need you to trace
Ian Bruckhurst's cell for me.

32:40.715 --> 32:42.181
Way ahead of you.

32:42.183 --> 32:44.600
He's at 4372 Santa Monica
Boulevard.

32:44.602 --> 32:47.269
That's the Fairfield
Manor Funeral Home.

32:48.305 --> 32:50.389
How do you want
to play this?

32:50.391 --> 32:53.008
With a little help.

32:53.843 --> 32:56.845
Okay.

33:01.118 --> 33:03.052
Good afternoon
and welcome

33:03.054 --> 33:05.321
to the Fairfield Manor
Funeral Home,

33:05.323 --> 33:07.156
where we acknowledge a life

33:07.158 --> 33:08.708
and cherish a memory.

33:08.710 --> 33:10.876
How may I help you?

33:15.248 --> 33:20.536
Uh, my name is...
Beatrice Fitzpatrick.

33:21.638 --> 33:24.924
A-And this is
my son Chester.

33:24.926 --> 33:26.592
We need to make
arrangements

33:26.594 --> 33:28.210
for...

33:28.212 --> 33:29.878
Daddy.

33:29.880 --> 33:31.880
Is the director available?

33:31.882 --> 33:34.183
I'm sorry for your loss.

33:34.185 --> 33:36.402
Please wait here
while I fetch him.

33:44.695 --> 33:48.414
You remember Felix,
don't you, sweetheart?

33:48.416 --> 33:51.033
I skinned him myself.

33:51.868 --> 33:54.370
Please tell me
you're in character.

33:57.290 --> 33:59.592
Hello. I'm David Lerner.

33:59.594 --> 34:01.577
Uh, Mrs. Fitzpatrick?

34:01.579 --> 34:02.878
Oh, yes, yes.

34:02.880 --> 34:04.680
Uh, and this
is my son

34:04.682 --> 34:07.383
Chester.

34:07.385 --> 34:10.219
Your... son. Well.

34:10.221 --> 34:12.920
Your father must've been
a very tall man.

34:13.757 --> 34:15.808
Don't pretend
like you knew Daddy.

34:15.810 --> 34:17.359
Oh, no, of course not.

34:17.360 --> 34:18.944
Um, please follow me.

34:18.946 --> 34:21.397
I would love to show you
the facility.

34:21.399 --> 34:22.598
Hetty, Nate,

34:22.600 --> 34:24.617
keep him busy
until we find Ian.

34:24.619 --> 34:26.735
A-And this is Felix.

34:26.737 --> 34:31.991
He's... almost like
a second child to me.

34:35.712 --> 34:37.213
I think we're good.

34:37.215 --> 34:38.581
Kens, Deeks,

34:38.583 --> 34:40.282
you're good to move in.

34:43.920 --> 34:46.005
Okay, that's a big oven.

34:46.007 --> 34:48.556
And it's on.

34:54.130 --> 34:56.232
I think someone's
in there.

34:56.234 --> 34:58.484
Quick, check to see if it's
Ian before the face melts off.

34:58.486 --> 35:01.103
You check to see if it's Ian
before the face melts off.

35:01.105 --> 35:03.022
I don't want to.
I don't want to either.

35:03.024 --> 35:04.056
Do it.
Not it!

35:04.058 --> 35:05.407
Oh, son of a...

35:09.664 --> 35:11.614
Mm, that is not him.

35:11.616 --> 35:12.648
Are you sure?
Yeah, no,

35:12.650 --> 35:13.916
I'm absolutely
positively sure.

35:13.918 --> 35:15.984
It's a woman who hopefully
died very peacefully

35:15.986 --> 35:18.153
in her sleep-- yeah.

35:27.715 --> 35:29.932
Okay.

35:33.520 --> 35:35.271
are you doing?

35:37.275 --> 35:39.024
He could be hiding.

35:39.026 --> 35:41.977
From who? He doesn't know
we're looking for him.

35:43.864 --> 35:45.114
- Eric...
- Yep.

35:45.116 --> 35:47.366
Please call Ian's cell phone.
I'm on it.

35:53.356 --> 35:55.825
What'd I say?

35:55.827 --> 35:58.460
You got me?
Mm-hmm.

35:58.462 --> 36:01.029
<i>Uno, dos...</i>

36:02.049 --> 36:04.633
That's all kinds of dead.

36:07.071 --> 36:09.371
Guess their partnership
went south.

36:09.373 --> 36:11.757
But we still don't know
what they were doing

36:11.759 --> 36:13.425
with all the bone and tissue.

36:13.427 --> 36:15.594
Then let's go find out.

36:20.433 --> 36:24.186
So, Mrs. Fitzpatrick, now that
I have a better sense of Daddy,

36:24.188 --> 36:29.058
uh, exactly what type of
service did you have in mind?

36:29.060 --> 36:30.276
Well...

36:30.278 --> 36:33.195
I've always envisioned
palominos galloping

36:33.197 --> 36:35.898
alongside the procession.

36:35.900 --> 36:38.701
And, um, doves.

36:38.703 --> 36:41.337
Yes. Doves.

36:41.339 --> 36:43.255
Uh, of course.

36:43.257 --> 36:45.541
Um, that would be
our platinum package.

36:45.543 --> 36:47.793
Wonderful choice.
It's very tasteful,

36:47.795 --> 36:49.962
yet it has that certain panache.

36:49.964 --> 36:51.413
Yo!

36:52.248 --> 36:54.934
You David Lerner?
Yes, but...

36:54.936 --> 36:57.469
I am with a client right now.
If you wouldn't mind

36:57.471 --> 36:59.087
stepping outside
for just a few minutes...

36:59.089 --> 37:01.090
I do mind. You owe us money.

37:01.092 --> 37:02.441
I am so sorry.

37:02.443 --> 37:04.476
- Look...
- Listen.

37:04.478 --> 37:07.446
Ian Bruckhurst owes us money,
but we can't find him,

37:07.448 --> 37:09.064
He used you as collateral,

37:09.066 --> 37:11.934
ergo, you owe us money,
and we're here

37:11.936 --> 37:14.436
- to collect.
- Yes, but you can't hold

37:14.438 --> 37:17.706
this gentleman accountable
for someone else's debts.

37:17.708 --> 37:18.874
Mummy's right.

37:18.876 --> 37:21.543
Well, Mummy needs to mind
her own damn business.

37:21.545 --> 37:23.712
This man owes us 45 large.

37:23.714 --> 37:25.447
Whatever for?

37:26.333 --> 37:28.667
You need to learn
when to shut your trap.

37:28.669 --> 37:31.119
Shut my what?

37:31.121 --> 37:33.088
Unless you want me to choke you
out with that dead dog

37:33.090 --> 37:34.139
you got around your neck.

37:34.141 --> 37:35.841
Excuse me!

37:35.843 --> 37:38.260
I demand to know
what this is all about.

37:38.262 --> 37:39.428
Oh, I'm sorry, shorty.

37:39.430 --> 37:41.296
I-I don't kiss and tell.

37:41.298 --> 37:45.651
I think I've heard
just about enough.

37:45.653 --> 37:47.102
Chester...

37:47.104 --> 37:49.488
we're leaving.

37:49.490 --> 37:52.858
N-No. Mrs. Fitzpatrick,
please, I...

37:53.693 --> 37:55.411
You ready to stop
playing games?

37:55.413 --> 37:57.162
I don't know who
this Ian person is,

37:57.164 --> 37:59.248
and I certainly don't
have $45,000 for you.

37:59.250 --> 38:02.167
He told us all about your
little scam there at the morgue.

38:03.119 --> 38:04.837
From what we hear,
you're rolling in it.

38:04.839 --> 38:06.372
You don't know
what you're talking about.

38:06.374 --> 38:08.540
We know all
about Lieutenant Prietto.

38:08.542 --> 38:11.326
Well, who doesn't?
The guy's all over the news.

38:11.328 --> 38:13.295
We know you stole his tissue,
and you did it

38:13.297 --> 38:15.097
to about 50 other people, too.

38:15.099 --> 38:17.716
Please, I...

38:17.718 --> 38:21.687
All right, all right, but it was
maybe half that number at best.

38:21.689 --> 38:23.338
Then you got our money.

38:24.173 --> 38:26.174
I don't have 45 grand.

38:26.176 --> 38:28.143
All I've got is Ian's cut.

38:28.145 --> 38:29.945
We'll take it.

38:29.947 --> 38:32.781
All right, just got to go
to the office and, um...

38:51.835 --> 38:54.503
Now, these, I like.

38:54.505 --> 38:56.722
This something I can reserve?

38:59.259 --> 39:03.012
Port, arms!

39:03.014 --> 39:05.014
Ready...

39:05.016 --> 39:06.682
aim...

39:06.684 --> 39:08.017
fire!

39:10.103 --> 39:13.689
Aim, fire!

39:16.225 --> 39:17.659
Aim...

39:17.661 --> 39:19.611
fire!

39:22.398 --> 39:24.700
Present...

39:24.702 --> 39:27.119
arms!

39:32.625 --> 39:34.676
We wanted to pay
our respects.

39:34.678 --> 39:37.296
Thank you again.

39:37.298 --> 39:39.765
I'm sorry for
the accusations,

39:39.767 --> 39:41.517
but I knew something
wasn't right.

39:41.519 --> 39:44.053
We're happy we could
help you find the truth.

39:44.055 --> 39:46.772
I couldn't have said good-bye
to him without knowing.

39:46.774 --> 39:48.390
You helped me find closure.

39:48.392 --> 39:51.643
Well, your country owed you
and your husband that much.

39:53.029 --> 39:55.197
I won't forget this.

40:06.326 --> 40:09.078
Hey, Nate...

40:09.080 --> 40:11.279
why don't you go talk to her?

40:13.666 --> 40:15.884
Good luck, buddy.

40:21.791 --> 40:23.675
Rose.
Hi, Nate.

40:23.677 --> 40:25.010
Hi.

40:25.012 --> 40:27.763
I knew you were innocent.

40:27.765 --> 40:30.766
I had to ask you
those questions.

40:30.768 --> 40:32.300
It's my job.

40:32.302 --> 40:34.937
I know.

40:36.439 --> 40:38.640
I hope you can forgive me.

40:39.492 --> 40:42.477
Me, too.

40:51.337 --> 40:53.472
Turns out a civilian
was forging paperwork.

40:53.474 --> 40:56.324
He was checking the tissue
donor box on dead Marines

40:56.326 --> 40:57.543
returning to Los Angeles.

40:57.545 --> 40:59.545
And the funeral parlor would
reach out to the family,

40:59.547 --> 41:01.763
then make sure the casket
got sent to the morgue.

41:01.765 --> 41:04.016
At which point,
Ian would forge Rose's signature

41:04.018 --> 41:05.601
and harvest the tissue.

41:05.603 --> 41:09.004
The money must have
been worth their while.

41:09.006 --> 41:10.522
It's a booming business.

41:10.524 --> 41:13.609
And bone and tissue
from healthy bodies goes for...

41:13.611 --> 41:15.144
$200,000 a pop.

41:15.146 --> 41:17.229
Mm.

41:17.231 --> 41:20.482
Mr. Granger pulled
a couple of strings,

41:20.484 --> 41:23.518
learned that Lieutenant Prietto
was killed

41:23.520 --> 41:25.787
in an ongoing
classified mission.

41:25.789 --> 41:28.523
That's why the Marines
couldn't tell Antonia the truth

41:28.525 --> 41:29.842
about how he died.

41:29.844 --> 41:32.661
Would've compromised
the lives of too many Marines.

41:32.663 --> 41:35.414
Huh.
How's Mr. Getz?

41:35.416 --> 41:37.532
He's been better.

41:37.534 --> 41:39.084
But he'll be fine.

41:39.086 --> 41:41.637
Would you look in
on him, Mr. Callen?

41:41.639 --> 41:44.506
And... give him this.

41:44.508 --> 41:46.374
Tell him he earned it.

41:46.376 --> 41:48.343
That's a good-looking chess set.

41:48.345 --> 41:50.012
Mm.

41:53.816 --> 41:55.934
And Mr. Hanna...

41:55.936 --> 41:59.771
would you please take a seat?

42:07.914 --> 42:10.365
I just want to commend you

42:10.367 --> 42:14.920
on your undercover
performance yesterday.

42:14.922 --> 42:19.424
Your words sounded
quite genuine.

42:21.378 --> 42:23.145
Thank you, Hetty.

42:23.147 --> 42:24.913
Mm-hmm.

42:24.915 --> 42:27.683
I hope you're not upset.

42:31.521 --> 42:34.473
I'm sensing some hostility here.

42:38.811 --> 42:41.280
Oh, Mr. Hanna...

42:41.282 --> 42:44.066
I'm just getting started.

42:44.068 --> 42:46.034
