01:19.908 --> 01:22.243
- I'm not calling her again.
- I wouldn't.

01:22.277 --> 01:24.244
What could I have possibly
done wrong this time?

01:24.263 --> 01:26.764
- You won't know unless you call.
- So you think I should call?

01:26.798 --> 01:29.767
- If you want to know what you did wrong.
- All right, I'll call.

01:29.801 --> 01:32.737
I'm not calling because I didn't do anything.

01:32.771 --> 01:35.673
- Good for you, taking a stand,
- a stand against what?

01:35.707 --> 01:38.509
A stand against women who get mad at
us when we haven't even done anything.

01:38.543 --> 01:40.144
When have you had that, turtle?

01:40.178 --> 01:41.712
I've had everything you've had.

01:41.747 --> 01:43.080
Jamie mad at you about something?

01:43.115 --> 01:45.383
No, but she did get weird when I told her

01:45.417 --> 01:47.485
About the sorority girls
rolling around in my underwear.

01:47.519 --> 01:49.287
- What did she say?
- Nothing much.

01:49.321 --> 01:51.289
Just that she's driving
me to school from now on.

01:51.323 --> 01:53.624
- Ooh, that make you nervous?
- No, why should it?

01:53.659 --> 01:55.760
Maybe 'cause you're still
thinking about that one girl.

01:55.794 --> 01:58.496
- Thinking about her?
- Yeah, like you want to bang her.

01:58.530 --> 02:00.431
Stop. I have a girlfriend.

02:00.465 --> 02:02.333
Oh, so you don't want to bang her?

02:02.367 --> 02:04.902
I don't even want to thi about
banging her 'cause I have a girlfriend.

02:04.936 --> 02:06.704
Good for you, turtle.

02:06.738 --> 02:08.472
Why, you think I should bang her?

02:08.507 --> 02:09.806
No no no no.

02:09.841 --> 02:12.209
But it would be normal
if you did think about it.

02:12.244 --> 02:15.980
I am thinking about it. I feel very guilty.

02:16.014 --> 02:18.482
Yo, johnny. What's up?

02:18.517 --> 02:21.235
- How was work?
- Awful.

02:21.269 --> 02:23.471
Stacy, can I get another
one of these, please?

02:23.505 --> 02:25.339
- Amstel.
- I'll have one of those too.

02:25.374 --> 02:26.874
- Okay, turtle?
- Driving.

02:26.908 --> 02:29.377
- All right.
- What happened?

02:29.411 --> 02:32.413
Apparently the facial lacerations

02:32.447 --> 02:34.115
 that coakley made
them give me are infected

02:34.149 --> 02:37.218
- And my character's got staph or something.
- Whoa.

02:37.252 --> 02:39.270
In tonight's scene, my speech was slurred

02:39.304 --> 02:41.288
So they had to rush me to the hospital.

02:41.322 --> 02:44.375
I think my character's heading for a coma.

02:44.426 --> 02:46.494
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

02:46.528 --> 02:48.162
I can't take much more of this.

02:48.196 --> 02:49.997
At least you're still getting a paycheck.

02:50.032 --> 02:52.550
I didn't get into this
business for a paycheck, turtle.

02:52.601 --> 02:55.936
I got into this business so that
the world could see my talent.

02:57.773 --> 02:59.640
Oh, christ. This just ain't my night.

02:59.674 --> 03:02.109
- What happened?
- See the guy who just walked in over there?

03:02.144 --> 03:04.562
- Don't look!
- You said, "see the guy over there?"

03:04.613 --> 03:07.031
- Now I'm telling you don't look at him.
- Who is he?

03:07.065 --> 03:09.600
It's the producer that fired
me from "melrose place."

03:09.634 --> 03:10.951
God, don't see me.

03:10.986 --> 03:13.838
Hold on a second. Johnny chase.

03:13.872 --> 03:16.907
- Johnny chase.
- Hey, phil yagota.

03:16.942 --> 03:20.177
- How the hell are you?
- What's going on, man? I'm good.

03:20.212 --> 03:22.747
- Been a long time.
- Yeah yeah.

03:22.781 --> 03:25.916
This is my brother vince, turtle and eric.

03:25.951 --> 03:27.852
- Hey, guys.  Big fan.
- Thanks.

03:27.886 --> 03:30.121
So how're you doing? Show's doing great?

03:30.155 --> 03:32.890
Yeah yeah. Loving it there.

03:32.924 --> 03:35.693
It's just one of the great
working experiences of my life.

03:35.727 --> 03:37.361
- Beautiful.
- No offense.

03:37.396 --> 03:40.064
None taken, man. We had some
good times back in the day.

03:40.098 --> 03:42.466
Yeah, it did take me

03:42.501 --> 03:44.435
To crazy girls after you canned me.

03:46.171 --> 03:48.773
I didn't can you. Higher ups than me did.

03:48.807 --> 03:51.709
- Yeah, well...
- I can't believe you're sitting here, man.

03:51.743 --> 03:54.245
I literally was just thinking about you.

03:54.279 --> 03:55.646
Yeah? Why?

03:55.680 --> 03:58.282
Well, we're gearing up to do "melrose" 2009

03:58.316 --> 04:00.818
And, um...

04:00.852 --> 04:03.421
There's a part you're perfect for.

04:03.455 --> 04:05.956
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:05.991 --> 04:08.058
You would work with me again?

04:08.093 --> 04:09.927
Yeah, johnny.

04:09.961 --> 04:13.180
In a second, man, if you were available.

04:13.215 --> 04:15.466
Hey, nice to see you.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.301
- Take care, guys.
- See you, man.

04:22.374 --> 04:24.925
Can you imagine me back on "melrose place"?

04:24.943 --> 04:27.027
Talkbout a
return-to-glory story.

04:27.062 --> 04:29.613
Well, you're not available so
stop killing yourself about it.

04:29.648 --> 04:32.199
Maybe I could get out of
my "five towns" contract.

04:32.234 --> 04:34.268
Coakley says he's gonna torture
you for the rest of your life.

04:34.286 --> 04:36.554
- You know that's never gonna happen.
- Never say never.

04:36.588 --> 04:38.689
Come on, let's have some positivity, people.

04:38.723 --> 04:41.775
- Think it's possible, bro?
- Anything's possible, johnny.

04:41.793 --> 04:44.278
- What should I do?
- Call your agent.

04:44.312 --> 04:46.163
It's 6:00 in the morning.

04:46.214 --> 04:47.982
I didn't mean right this second.

04:48.016 --> 04:50.568
Yeah, maybe I'll wait 30 minutes.

04:50.602 --> 04:52.670
<i>- Where are you going?
- I'm going to ashley's.</i>

04:52.721 --> 04:54.505
<i>- I got to know what I did.
- You've been drinking.</i>

04:54.556 --> 04:56.757
Yeah, okay, you're right.
Turtle, you gonna drive me?

04:56.791 --> 04:58.676
What happened to taking a stand?

04:58.727 --> 05:01.512
- Come on, get up. I need a ride.
- Good luck.

05:10.822 --> 05:13.057
I can't wait any longer.

05:15.544 --> 05:17.711
Well, you have no temperature.

05:17.746 --> 05:20.548
Check it again. I know I'm dying.

05:20.582 --> 05:23.918
You're not dying. Leaving ari has
you fearing for your life, maybe.

05:23.952 --> 05:27.338
But this is going to be the best
thing that's ever happened to you.

05:27.372 --> 05:30.140
Trust me.

05:30.175 --> 05:33.210
- Is it ari?
- Nope, johnny chase.

05:33.245 --> 05:34.945
My only client.

05:34.980 --> 05:36.914
What if he doesn't want to come with me?

05:36.948 --> 05:39.533
Convey confidence and he will.

05:39.568 --> 05:42.502
All right?

05:42.521 --> 05:45.339
- Hi, johnny.
- Hey, lloyd, I got some news.

05:45.357 --> 05:47.942
I do as well. I've left
ari for greener pastures.

05:47.976 --> 05:50.277
<i>I'd like a commitment from
you that you're coming with me.</i>

05:50.312 --> 05:52.947
<i>- You left ari?
- I'm working with adam davies now.</i>

05:52.981 --> 05:56.100
- Jesus christ, not today!
- There's nothing to worry about.

05:56.134 --> 05:58.569
Look, I think maybe I can
get on the new "melrose place"

05:58.620 --> 06:00.554
If I can get out of my "five towns" contract.

06:00.589 --> 06:02.856
- Johnny...
- Lloyd, I need you to find out if it's true.

06:02.874 --> 06:05.543
If it is, see if you can
get me out of that contract.

06:05.577 --> 06:07.211
Are you gonna come with me?

06:07.245 --> 06:09.463
Take care of what I just
told you and we'll talk.

06:09.497 --> 06:13.050
Later. I am so screwed.

06:13.084 --> 06:15.002
Christ, I've got work to do.

06:15.036 --> 06:16.954
Grab me a handful of xanaxs, would you?

06:16.988 --> 06:18.889
I'm okay, I'm in work mode. Go!

06:21.142 --> 06:23.844
Stop stop stop.

06:23.878 --> 06:25.813
Want me to wait?

06:25.847 --> 06:27.448
No, I'm all good.

06:27.482 --> 06:29.617
You are a confident drunk.

06:39.861 --> 06:41.795
Jesus christ, eric. What are you doing?

06:41.830 --> 06:44.365
- Let me in.
- Go to the front.

06:46.601 --> 06:48.802
- What time is it?
- It's early.

06:48.837 --> 06:50.704
- You didn't call me back.
- I was going to.

06:50.739 --> 06:52.339
I didn't feel like waiting.

06:52.374 --> 06:54.308
- I don't want to get in a fight.
- Me either.

06:54.342 --> 06:56.810
But I know I'm in trouble. And
since I know I didn't do anything

06:56.845 --> 06:59.179
Why don't you tell me what the
problem is so I can clear this up?

06:59.214 --> 07:01.298
- Are you drunk?
- Not really.

07:01.333 --> 07:04.051
What did I do?

07:04.085 --> 07:07.388
Okay, who is rupert pupkin?

07:07.422 --> 07:08.656
What?

07:08.690 --> 07:10.424
Yesterday morning when the phone rang

07:10.458 --> 07:12.359
- You said it was turtle.
- It was.

07:12.394 --> 07:14.161
- Then you said it was drama.
- It was.

07:14.195 --> 07:16.864
Then the caller I.D.
Said it was rupert pupkin.

07:16.898 --> 07:18.432
Jesus.

07:18.466 --> 07:20.534
Who is rupert pupkin?

07:20.568 --> 07:22.303
It's,
uh--

07:22.337 --> 07:24.638
Well, he's a guy I've
been seeing on the side.

07:25.740 --> 07:27.574
I'm kidding. It's vince's alias.

07:27.609 --> 07:30.010
- His alias?
- Yeah, he can't be calling people

07:30.045 --> 07:32.746
And vincent chase comes up.
It's from "king of comedy."

07:36.017 --> 07:38.819
- Why don't you trust me?
- I don't know.

07:38.853 --> 07:41.555
You're gonna have to learn
to or it's never gonna work.

07:41.589 --> 07:44.291
This is why I didn't want to talk last night.

07:44.326 --> 07:45.843
I don't want to be grilling you.

07:45.894 --> 07:48.896
- Something about us is off.
- We're not off.

07:48.930 --> 07:50.848
I'm not like this.

07:50.899 --> 07:53.350
Then what are you like? Tell
me, please, I want to know.

07:53.401 --> 07:56.236
Eric, it's like 7:00 a.M.

07:56.271 --> 07:59.139
Good, that way we can
sleep before I go to work.

07:59.174 --> 08:00.574
Oh, sleep?

08:00.608 --> 08:02.543
Yeah, trust me.

08:04.112 --> 08:06.046
Okay, fine.

08:09.984 --> 08:12.152
- Baby.
- Yeah?

08:12.170 --> 08:13.671
I woke up with wood.

08:13.705 --> 08:15.489
And why is that my problem?

08:15.507 --> 08:16.957
Just take care of me.

08:16.991 --> 08:18.592
How about you te care of me?

08:18.626 --> 08:21.045
Come on, I have to work all
day. I don't want to work now.

08:21.096 --> 08:23.714
- Sorry.
- Okay, fine.

08:29.837 --> 08:31.939
<i>Jesus.</i>

08:31.973 --> 08:34.390
- Rupert pupkin?
- Vince.

08:34.442 --> 08:36.393
- Hello?
- Oh god.

08:36.443 --> 08:39.645
Baby, I need at least a blowjob.

08:39.679 --> 08:41.648
Blow yourself.

08:41.682 --> 08:43.616
Yo, buddy.

08:43.650 --> 08:45.819
Yo, ari, sorry for calling so early.

08:45.854 --> 08:47.888
<i>- Everything okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

08:47.922 --> 08:50.057
- It's johnny.
- I'm freaking out, ari.

08:50.091 --> 08:51.992
What's the problem?

08:52.026 --> 08:54.461
<i>He heard lloyd's going over to adam davies.</i>

08:56.531 --> 08:59.032
<i>- Ari?
- Adam davies?</i>

08:59.050 --> 09:00.501
Yeah, I assumed you knew.

09:00.535 --> 09:02.302
Of course I knew.

09:02.337 --> 09:04.805
<i>Good riddance. What's drama worried about?</i>

09:04.839 --> 09:07.707
He's got a career crisis going on
and he's not sure lloyd can handle it.

09:07.726 --> 09:10.377
<i>- Of course he can't handle it.
- I'm desperate for help, ari.</i>

09:10.395 --> 09:13.347
Help is on the way. Just give me the details.

09:15.100 --> 09:17.901
I'm sorry you feel that way, ari.

09:17.936 --> 09:19.269
<i>You're sorry, lloyd?!</i>

09:19.320 --> 09:23.590
You have no idea how
sorry you're going to be.

09:23.625 --> 09:25.192
I am going to destroy you.

09:25.226 --> 09:27.661
I am going to erode

09:27.695 --> 09:30.414
Every fiber of your spirit.

09:30.448 --> 09:32.399
<i>You no longer exist.</i>

09:32.434 --> 09:34.401
<i>You are dead to me.</i>

09:34.419 --> 09:37.738
And the town will know that
anyone meeting with you,

09:37.772 --> 09:40.474
Speaking with you, or even nodding to you

09:40.508 --> 09:42.576
On the street will be dead as well.

09:42.610 --> 09:46.180
So die, lloyd. Die die die!

09:46.214 --> 09:48.966
<i>And when you're gagging on davies' balls</i>

09:49.017 --> 09:51.952
I want  you to bite down so he can die too.

09:51.986 --> 09:53.787
Call dan coakley's office,

09:53.822 --> 09:56.723
Set up an emergency meeting asap.

09:58.593 --> 10:00.861
Welcome, lloyd.

10:00.895 --> 10:03.697
- Glad to have you onboard.
- Glad to be here, thank you.

10:03.731 --> 10:07.151
Come on back. Gonna get an
office ready for you after lunch.

10:07.185 --> 10:09.486
But in the meantime, you
can use the conference room

10:09.537 --> 10:11.121
And jeff here will help
you with anything you need.

10:11.156 --> 10:12.990
- Thank you so
much. - Mm-hmm.

10:13.024 --> 10:16.109
Jeff, get dan coakley on the phone.
Tell him it's regarding johnny chase.

10:16.144 --> 10:19.129
And call phil yagoda over at "melrose
place." I need to speak with him as well.

10:19.164 --> 10:20.780
Got it.

10:20.799 --> 10:23.417
Work mode already. I love it.

10:23.451 --> 10:26.637
Tell john I said welcome back.

10:26.671 --> 10:28.505
Will do.

10:29.891 --> 10:32.342
Okay, so the reason I didn't
want to see you last night

10:32.377 --> 10:35.512
- Was 'cause I needed time to formulate a plan.
- What do you mean?

10:35.547 --> 10:38.782
I mean, you show up and come at
me all like, "what's your deal?"

10:38.817 --> 10:41.752
- And I wasn't prepared.
- So now you're prepared?

10:41.786 --> 10:43.821
Yes.

10:43.855 --> 10:45.956
- Should I be worried?
- No.

10:45.990 --> 10:48.325
You should be excited
because I think I figured out

10:48.359 --> 10:50.694
How to deal with all the
shit and move past it.

10:50.745 --> 10:52.980
Anything you need.

10:53.014 --> 10:55.332
Well, first off, I need
to know that your assistant

10:55.366 --> 10:57.534
Who wants to ride you will not be a problem.

10:57.569 --> 11:00.204
- My assistant?
- The one that looks like a playmate.

11:00.238 --> 11:03.073
She doesn't want to ride me.
What are you talking about?

11:03.107 --> 11:05.309
Trust me, she does.

11:05.343 --> 11:07.994
When I stopped by your office
she was giving me dirty looks.

11:08.012 --> 11:10.030
<i>I think you're imagining things.</i>

11:10.064 --> 11:12.132
<i>I know what I saw.</i>

11:12.166 --> 11:15.502
Look, I like you, okay? I want this to work.

11:15.537 --> 11:17.337
So just tell me what you need.

11:17.355 --> 11:20.290
I want to read your emails.

11:20.325 --> 11:21.592
You want to read my emails?

11:21.626 --> 11:23.843
Just from the last week or so.

11:23.862 --> 11:25.729
I just want to see who you've been talking to

11:25.780 --> 11:27.531
And how you've been talking to them.

11:27.565 --> 11:30.317
If there's nothing weird,
I'll never ask again.

11:30.351 --> 11:32.653
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

11:32.687 --> 11:35.355
And you can read mine too.

11:35.373 --> 11:38.976
I want us to have totally
open and honest relationship.

11:39.010 --> 11:41.445
Here.

11:43.314 --> 11:46.083
Why is nobody calling me back?

11:46.117 --> 11:48.485
- This is a freaking nightmare.
- It's early, johnny.

11:48.519 --> 11:50.320
Relax, ari said he'd handle it.

11:50.355 --> 11:53.423
What if he doesn't? I miss this, I
may never get another opportunity.

11:53.458 --> 11:57.127
- Drama, you got to calm down.
- I can't calm down.

11:57.161 --> 11:59.396
Come on, ring, phone.
Ring, god damn it! Ring!

11:59.430 --> 12:01.732
That's jamie.

12:01.766 --> 12:04.868
- All right, guys.
- Have fun.

12:06.738 --> 12:09.072
- Okay, I'm nervous.
- About what?

12:09.107 --> 12:11.074
- You haven't done anything.
- Yeah.

12:11.109 --> 12:14.311
- Man up, turtle.
- All right. Good luck.

12:14.345 --> 12:16.380
- Later.
- Later.

12:16.414 --> 12:18.482
Finally.

12:18.516 --> 12:21.118
- Give me something good, lloyd.
- I spoke with phil yagoda.

12:21.152 --> 12:22.920
<i>- Yeah?
- "melrose" is real.</i>

12:22.954 --> 12:25.489
Phil likes you for the role but
you'd have to test for the network.

12:25.523 --> 12:27.157
How many other people are testing?

12:27.191 --> 12:28.825
They have no one else right now.

12:28.860 --> 12:30.694
I like those odds.

12:30.728 --> 12:32.796
<i>If you don't get it, you'll have nothing.</i>

12:32.830 --> 12:35.832
So my recommendation personally is
you stick with the paycheck you have.

12:35.867 --> 12:37.834
No way. This opportunity is meant to be.

12:37.869 --> 12:39.503
I'm walking dead at "five towns."

12:39.537 --> 12:41.805
- Have you spoken to coakley yet?
- I left word.

12:41.839 --> 12:43.907
- Leave word again.
- I'm into it, johnny.

12:43.942 --> 12:46.677
So is ari, lloyd. Just so you know.

12:46.711 --> 12:49.313
I wish you hadn't done that.
Why did you do that, johnny?

12:49.347 --> 12:51.949
'cause this is my life, lloyd.

12:51.983 --> 12:55.669
Try dan coakley again now.

12:55.703 --> 12:58.639
Since when do you get involved
in low-level tv actor discussions?

12:58.673 --> 13:01.808
- Since now, dan.
- Since it's vincent chase's brother.

13:01.843 --> 13:05.295
I'm asking for a favor, all
right? Cut the kid loose.

13:05.330 --> 13:07.414
But, ari, come on. You don't know understand

13:07.448 --> 13:10.116
How much happy it makes me to see him suffer.

13:10.134 --> 13:11.652
You're on the waiting list at riv.

13:11.686 --> 13:13.387
How happy would it make you to be a member?

13:13.421 --> 13:15.856
You can move me up that list?

13:15.890 --> 13:17.357
I can move mountains, dan.

13:17.392 --> 13:20.193
And all I've got to do is just
let him out of his contract?

13:20.228 --> 13:23.030
I'm sorry, a lloyd lee on the line again.

13:23.064 --> 13:24.798
He says it's truly urgent.

13:24.816 --> 13:26.566
One other thing you'd have to do.

13:26.601 --> 13:30.337
<i>I'm sorry, mr. Lee, but mr.
Coakley says that any discussions</i>

13:30.371 --> 13:33.240
About johnny chase will have
to be with his agent ari gold,

13:33.274 --> 13:36.493
<i>And that he will not be
returning your call ever.</i>

13:36.527 --> 13:37.744
Ever?

13:37.779 --> 13:39.880
Why would he when you're a dead man?

13:39.914 --> 13:42.449
<i>I'm everywhere, lloyd.</i>

13:44.285 --> 13:46.420
I can't believe you handed over your berry.

13:46.454 --> 13:48.538
I didn't know what to do. I was so shocked.

13:48.589 --> 13:50.574
You should have told her to file a subpoena.

13:50.608 --> 13:52.109
Yeah, you have nothing to hide anyway.

13:52.143 --> 13:54.478
- No, what do I have to hide?
- Nothing.

13:54.512 --> 13:56.162
<i>- I got to go to work.
- Enjoy.</i>

13:56.180 --> 13:58.015
I'll talk to you later.

13:58.049 --> 14:00.634
Morning, brit. Any calls?

14:00.668 --> 14:02.269
Yeah, you got a bunch of messages.

14:02.303 --> 14:04.638
Thanks. You okay?

14:04.672 --> 14:06.523
Yeah.

14:06.557 --> 14:08.859
Okay.

14:08.893 --> 14:11.478
Actually...

14:11.512 --> 14:15.065
- I need to apologize.
- For what?

14:15.116 --> 14:17.901
Yesterday when your girlfriend
came in, I think I was kind of rude.

14:17.935 --> 14:20.037
Really? She didn't mention anything.

14:20.071 --> 14:22.189
Oh good. Good, I'm relieved.
I was just distracted.

14:22.223 --> 14:24.190
Oh, sorry. Everything all right?

14:24.208 --> 14:26.410
Yeah, just some boy trouble.

14:26.444 --> 14:28.111
- Oh, sorry.
- I'll deal.

14:28.146 --> 14:30.530
Well, if you ever need
to talk about anything.

14:30.548 --> 14:32.215
- With you?
- Yeah.

14:32.250 --> 14:34.584
We should be able to talk
about that stuff, right?

14:34.635 --> 14:36.670
Is there something on your mind, eric?

14:36.704 --> 14:39.506
Actually...

14:39.540 --> 14:41.708
Would you ever ask a guy to read his emails?

14:41.743 --> 14:44.244
No. I'd just look at them.

14:44.278 --> 14:46.063
Kidding.

14:46.097 --> 14:47.881
- Did ashley?
- Yes.

14:47.915 --> 14:50.250
Why? What did you do?

14:50.284 --> 14:52.219
- I didn't do anything.
- You had to have.

14:52.253 --> 14:54.988
I lied to her once about my ex calling.

14:55.022 --> 14:57.390
- Do you still see her?
- My ex? Not like that.

14:57.425 --> 14:59.259
The last time I saw her
I ditched her for ashley.

14:59.293 --> 15:01.862
- So ashley's paranoid?
- Yeah, she's got some trust issues.

15:01.896 --> 15:04.181
- Obviously.
- So you don't think she's warranted?

15:04.215 --> 15:06.349
No, I think she's crazy.

15:12.707 --> 15:15.709
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, why?

15:15.743 --> 15:18.211
- You're acting weird.
- Weird?

15:18.246 --> 15:20.347
Yeah, you're so quiet.

15:20.381 --> 15:22.749
No, just thinking about class,

15:22.784 --> 15:24.885
Hoping there's not like a pop quiz.

15:24.919 --> 15:26.753
Do you get those in college?

15:26.788 --> 15:29.189
No.

15:37.131 --> 15:38.799
What's wrong?

15:38.833 --> 15:40.667
Nothing. Really.

15:40.701 --> 15:43.103
Tell me about this meeting.

15:43.137 --> 15:46.106
Okay, well, it's josh schwartz

15:46.140 --> 15:48.375
And he's got this new show that I love.

15:48.409 --> 15:51.545
It's called "runaways" and
it's about these two girls

15:51.579 --> 15:54.447
Who are completely in debt and jobless

15:54.482 --> 15:56.983
And hate their lives
and they run away to l.A.

15:57.018 --> 15:58.585
It's really good.

15:58.619 --> 16:02.322
But I have to do a "bahston" accent.

16:02.356 --> 16:04.691
I've never really done an accent.

16:04.725 --> 16:07.327
- You could do it.
- You think?

16:07.361 --> 16:09.930
I know you can. And I
know you're gonna get this.

16:09.964 --> 16:12.465
- I feel it.
- Thanks.

16:16.504 --> 16:19.206
Are those the whores
who stole your underwear?

16:19.240 --> 16:20.841
What?

16:20.875 --> 16:24.077
The sorority hos that are staring at us.

16:24.111 --> 16:26.213
Yeah, I think so.

16:26.247 --> 16:28.915
The brunette's pretty cute.

16:28.950 --> 16:30.917
You think?

16:30.952 --> 16:33.186
You don't think so?

16:33.221 --> 16:35.021
Nah, she's not my type.

16:37.825 --> 16:39.993
- Okay, you'd better get to class.
- Yup.

16:40.027 --> 16:42.529
If my meeting finishes
early I'll pick you up.

16:42.563 --> 16:45.398
Don't worry about it. Vince
is bored and wants to drive.

16:45.433 --> 16:48.034
- Good luck at your meeting.
- Thanks.

16:49.904 --> 16:52.472
- Turtle!
- Yeah?

16:54.542 --> 16:56.476
Come here.

17:05.051 --> 17:07.454
How did you do it, ari? How?

17:07.488 --> 17:10.323
That's what I do. I part seas.

17:10.358 --> 17:13.193
Don't try to comprehend it. Just be thankful

17:13.227 --> 17:15.662
<i>That you've been blessed
with the proximity to it.</i>

17:15.695 --> 17:18.164
<i>- I can't thank you enough.
- Actually, you can.</i>

17:18.199 --> 17:21.334
- How?
- By staying with me. By not going with lloyd.

17:21.368 --> 17:24.137
You want to represent me?

17:24.171 --> 17:25.805
<i>Hell yeah. You're family.</i>

17:25.839 --> 17:27.240
I wouldn't have it any other way.

17:27.275 --> 17:28.742
Make sure you kill that test.

17:28.776 --> 17:31.111
I will, ari. Thanks.

17:31.145 --> 17:33.513
- My pleasure. Bye.
- Bye.

17:33.547 --> 17:35.682
I'm off "five towns."

17:35.716 --> 17:38.868
- How do you feel?
- Relieved.

17:40.571 --> 17:43.039
You've got to be shittng me.

17:46.894 --> 17:49.996
Lloyd, here's the bottom
line, as hard as it is to hear.

17:50.031 --> 17:52.899
I let u be my agent because ari would not be.

17:52.934 --> 17:55.068
We had some fun.

17:55.086 --> 17:57.087
And now not only does ari want to sign me,

17:57.121 --> 17:59.990
But he took care of what
you could not take care of.

18:00.024 --> 18:02.025
What else is there to say?

18:02.059 --> 18:05.011
Johnny drama, I got you on "five towns."

18:05.046 --> 18:07.514
- Ari has never even seen it.
- Really?

18:07.548 --> 18:10.483
I don't think he's seen
anything you've ever done.

18:10.518 --> 18:12.686
How is that possible?

18:12.720 --> 18:14.721
I've seen everything from "viking quest"

18:14.755 --> 18:16.122
To the new "new love boat."

18:16.157 --> 18:18.441
That pilot never even aired.

18:18.476 --> 18:20.277
You were a tremendous young merrill stubing.

18:20.311 --> 18:22.362
- You think?
- I know.

18:22.396 --> 18:25.982
Johnny, you've been my one
client for over two years.

18:26.033 --> 18:29.185
And I will continue to treat
you like you're my only client

18:29.220 --> 18:31.254
For the rest of your career. Will ari?

18:31.289 --> 18:34.024
I will be devastated if
I lose you, johnny drama.

18:34.058 --> 18:36.159
You think ari will even care?

18:36.193 --> 18:38.928
I believe in your talent. Does ari?

18:38.963 --> 18:42.132
Or does he want you because he
doesn't want to piss off vince?

18:42.166 --> 18:44.968
Or does he want you just
so he can piss me off?

18:45.002 --> 18:48.238
This is the first day
of the rest of your life.

18:48.272 --> 18:51.274
What do you want?

18:51.309 --> 18:53.159
Britney thinks ashley's crazy.

18:53.194 --> 18:56.179
<i>- I think britney wants you.
- So ashley's not crazy?</i>

18:56.230 --> 18:59.783
She may be, but I think regardless,
britney's trying to move her out of the way.

18:59.817 --> 19:02.435
<i>- So what do I do?
- How hot is britney?</i>

19:02.469 --> 19:04.237
<i>Will you stop it, vince?</i>

19:04.271 --> 19:06.623
You want me to come down there
and move her out of your way?

19:06.657 --> 19:08.124
<i>Vince.</i>

19:08.159 --> 19:10.493
Look, e, how did you feel
about that email thing?

19:10.528 --> 19:12.329
Well, I feel violated.

19:12.363 --> 19:14.481
Your instincts about ashley from minute one

19:14.515 --> 19:16.549
Were that all signs pointed to crazy.

19:16.584 --> 19:19.652
<i>- I guess I need to end it.
- I think you do.</i>

19:19.670 --> 19:21.738
I wasn't expecting so much math.

19:21.772 --> 19:23.540
It is a business class, turtle.

19:23.574 --> 19:26.776
- Yeah.
- But I think you're doing great.

19:26.811 --> 19:29.379
- Thanks. See you Friday.
- All right.

19:30.815 --> 19:34.984
So wow, you and jamie are
like a real couple, huh?

19:35.019 --> 19:36.653
What did you think?

19:36.687 --> 19:38.254
I don't know.

19:38.289 --> 19:41.458
I mean, you see stuff in tabloids
and never know if it's true or not.

19:41.492 --> 19:43.259
It is.

19:43.294 --> 19:46.596
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

19:46.630 --> 19:48.865
- Yo, turtle.
- Yo.

19:48.933 --> 19:50.934
Is that vincent chas

19:50.968 --> 19:52.635
Yeah. Got to go.

19:52.670 --> 19:55.605
- Who are you?
- I'm turtle.

19:55.639 --> 19:57.574
See you later.

20:00.177 --> 20:01.711
What up?

20:03.714 --> 20:05.014
- That the girl?
- Yup.

20:05.049 --> 20:07.884
- She's cute.
- Yup.

20:07.918 --> 20:09.652
You all right?

20:09.687 --> 20:12.589
I'm in the middle of a
serious love triangle, vin.

20:12.623 --> 20:15.592
- It's never happened to me before.
- It's nice, isn't it?

20:15.626 --> 20:18.027
No, it's not nice. It's freaking me out.

20:19.830 --> 20:21.765
- Ari.
- Yeah?

20:21.799 --> 20:24.834
- A johnny chase is here.
- Hey, drama, what's happening?

20:24.869 --> 20:28.271
Not much. Thought I'd come
by and see my new agent.

20:28.305 --> 20:30.707
Ah.

20:30.741 --> 20:33.109
Look, if you're busy I can come back.

20:33.144 --> 20:35.678
Yeah, I've got a stack of scripts.

20:35.713 --> 20:38.481
- You want to grab lunch?
- Lunch?

20:38.516 --> 20:42.185
- My treat.
- No, I can't grab lunch.

20:42.219 --> 20:44.354
I understand.

20:44.388 --> 20:45.922
Maybe tomorrow.

20:45.956 --> 20:47.857
Or dinner. Or breakfast.

20:47.892 --> 20:49.993
Is there something you want to talk about?

20:52.096 --> 20:53.430
Do you like me, ari?

20:53.464 --> 20:55.265
You're freaking me out, drama.

20:55.299 --> 20:57.967
- Do you think I'm talented?
- Are you having a breakdown?

20:58.002 --> 20:59.836
No, seriously. I want to know.

20:59.870 --> 21:03.506
Yes, I think you are talented.

21:03.541 --> 21:06.526
- What have you liked me in?
- Okay, what is this about?

21:06.560 --> 21:08.278
I want to know why you want to sign me.

21:08.312 --> 21:09.979
Did lloyd call you?

21:10.014 --> 21:12.549
He couldn't have possibly made an impression.

21:12.583 --> 21:14.984
- He believes in me.
- He is a child.

21:15.035 --> 21:16.953
- But he believes in me.
- So do I.

21:16.987 --> 21:18.188
- Do you?
- Yes.

21:18.222 --> 21:19.589
Or do you hate him so much

21:19.623 --> 21:21.324
That you'd take me to spite him?

21:21.375 --> 21:23.176
- Drama...
- Just answer me, ari.

21:23.210 --> 21:26.779
Do you believe in my talent?
Because this is my life.

21:26.797 --> 21:29.782
What you did for me today was amazing.

21:29.817 --> 21:32.819
I'll never forget it. If you
really want me here, I'm here.

21:32.853 --> 21:35.989
But you've got to be honest with me.

21:36.023 --> 21:39.509
You've got to look me in the face and
tell me that you believe in my talent

21:39.560 --> 21:40.994
Or you've got to let me go.

21:45.649 --> 21:47.317
Go.

21:47.351 --> 21:49.836
But it's because I like you, all right.

21:49.870 --> 21:53.223
And believe me, that little prick's gonna
have plenty of time to take care of you.

21:55.559 --> 21:57.794
- Thank you, ari.
- Good luck to you, drama.

21:57.828 --> 22:00.730
And tell that man of yours to
keep his eyes pinned wide open

22:00.764 --> 22:02.198
'cause I'm gonna be gunning for him.

22:02.233 --> 22:04.384
I will.

22:07.805 --> 22:10.473
All right, lloyd, I'll sign with you.

22:10.508 --> 22:12.809
Yippie-ki-yay,
motherfucker!

22:12.843 --> 22:15.011
- Calm down, lloyd.
- I can't.

22:15.045 --> 22:17.046
We're gonna make magic
together, johnny drama.

22:17.097 --> 22:19.382
Let me just please get this show.

22:19.416 --> 22:22.485
You will. I believe in you, johnny drama!

22:22.520 --> 22:26.322
- I believe!
- Thanks, lloyd. Later.

22:30.261 --> 22:32.128
Thank you.

22:32.162 --> 22:33.930
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:33.964 --> 22:36.165
- Sorry I'm late.
- No problem.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.701
- I got stuck on a conference call.
- That's okay.

22:38.736 --> 22:41.404
I wanted to talk to you about something.

22:41.455 --> 22:43.439
I wanted to talk to you too.

22:43.474 --> 22:45.041
Can I go first?

22:45.075 --> 22:46.743
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

22:46.794 --> 22:48.411
Sorry.

22:48.462 --> 22:50.630
That's okay.

22:51.999 --> 22:53.466
I feel awful.

22:53.500 --> 22:56.252
I should not have asked
you to show me your emails.

22:56.303 --> 22:59.505
It's just that if we're
going to have a relationship--

22:59.539 --> 23:01.874
That's what I want to talk to you about.

23:01.909 --> 23:03.810
Oh.

23:03.844 --> 23:06.646
I think part of the reason
you're feeling insecure--

23:06.680 --> 23:09.966
I thought I turned this thing off.

23:11.718 --> 23:14.887
Ahem. I think part of the reason
that you're feeling insecure

23:14.905 --> 23:17.490
Is because I'm not totally there.

23:19.526 --> 23:20.827
Are you breaking up with me?

23:20.861 --> 23:23.162
It's just not a good time
for me right now, ashley.

23:23.197 --> 23:25.365
But this morning you felt different?

23:25.399 --> 23:30.119
Who is that?
- Calm down. It's just my office.

23:30.170 --> 23:33.122
Just your assistant, you mean.
- Yeah, she does work for me.

23:33.173 --> 23:36.526
And what else does she do for you?
- Is that what this is really about?

23:36.560 --> 23:40.213
I was right, wasn't I?
She wants you and you like it.

23:40.247 --> 23:42.815
Answer the phone if not.

23:42.850 --> 23:44.417
- Let's hear you talk to her.
- No.

23:44.435 --> 23:46.853
- Why, 'cause you're lying?
- Because it's not her.

23:46.887 --> 23:49.055
- Who is it then, sloan?
- Would you calm down, please?

23:49.089 --> 23:50.923
Don't tell me to calm down.
Just tell me who it is.

23:50.941 --> 23:53.443
It's my aunt. Are you happy? Look.

23:55.296 --> 23:57.313
- I'm sorry.
- I should go.

23:57.364 --> 24:00.099
- Please don't.
- There's nothing left to talk about.

24:00.117 --> 24:01.968
I can't believe this.

24:02.002 --> 24:04.637
You know, you are really
a piece-of-shit liar.

24:04.672 --> 24:06.656
You love fucking with me, don't you?

24:06.690 --> 24:08.858
You just said this morning
you wanted to be exclusive

24:08.892 --> 24:11.127
So you could use me and pull this shit now.

24:11.161 --> 24:14.564
I can't believe I fell for your nice guy act.

24:14.598 --> 24:16.332
You are really sick.

24:16.367 --> 24:17.700
I'm sorry you feel that way.

24:17.735 --> 24:19.285
And I'm sorry you're a douchebag.

24:19.303 --> 24:21.788
Look, I didn't lie to you about anything.

24:21.822 --> 24:23.723
I actually liked you.

24:23.757 --> 24:25.808
But you show up at the premiere uninvited,

24:25.843 --> 24:28.361
You check my phone, you
listen to my messages,

24:28.395 --> 24:30.430
You want my emails.

24:30.464 --> 24:33.499
You say you're not crazy, but
all signs point to the contrary.

24:33.534 --> 24:35.468
I'm sorry.

24:41.859 --> 24:44.944
Hey, anything important?
I was just eating dinner.

24:44.978 --> 24:46.996
<i>She ask to see blood samples?</i>

24:47.031 --> 24:48.948
- No.
- You sound sad.

24:48.982 --> 24:51.034
<i>- I broke up with her.
- Oh.</i>

24:51.085 --> 24:53.920
- Come meet me for a drink.
- I don't think that's such a good idea.

24:53.954 --> 24:56.539
Eric, don't be ridiculous. I'm not after you.

24:56.590 --> 24:59.008
But I've got a couple of
cute friends who might be.

24:59.043 --> 25:01.327
<i>- And you're sad.
- I'm not sad.</i>

25:01.345 --> 25:03.346
<i>Okay.</i>

25:03.380 --> 25:05.798
- Your friends cute?
- My friends are hot.

25:05.833 --> 25:08.501
- Maybe call some of your friends?
- Okay.

25:08.519 --> 25:10.336
<i>We're at the green door. Hurry up.</i>

25:10.354 --> 25:12.605
I'll see you in 15 minutes.

25:18.946 --> 25:20.596
This time you're doing single right, e.

25:20.631 --> 25:23.366
- Like you?
- You know it, son.

25:23.400 --> 25:25.735
Some people actually like
being in a relationship.

25:25.786 --> 25:28.454
Indeed. Love is underrated.

25:28.489 --> 25:30.490
- What?
- No, it's...

25:30.524 --> 25:33.876
I just broke up with someone
recently and I'm feelingomeopre.

25:33.911 --> 25:35.745
- He was a prick.
- Loser.

25:35.796 --> 25:37.363
Yeah.

25:37.381 --> 25:39.698
- If you're looking for a rebound...
- I'm not.

25:42.035 --> 25:44.537
I'm not either.

25:44.571 --> 25:47.223
So how do you think e will
last on the open market?

25:47.257 --> 25:48.908
Nine days.

25:48.942 --> 25:51.477
I think someone will pick
him up pretty quickly.

25:51.512 --> 25:53.980
Not me. I'm a career gal.

25:54.014 --> 25:56.399
Which means you don't
look at her either, vince.

25:56.433 --> 25:58.401
No one goes near my assistant.
You hear that, drama?

25:58.435 --> 26:01.771
Don't worry, I'm on a no-sex-till-I-book-
"melrose" thing anyway.

26:01.822 --> 26:03.990
Oh, that's too bad.

26:04.024 --> 26:06.025
I'm kidding.

26:06.059 --> 26:09.112
Speaking of girlfriends.

26:09.163 --> 26:10.729
You guys mind keeping it down?

26:10.748 --> 26:12.632
She's been a little jealous lately.

26:12.666 --> 26:15.034
Hey, babe. You ready for me to pick you up?

26:15.068 --> 26:17.754
Yeah, but my agent just called me.

26:17.788 --> 26:19.922
- Did you get the role?
- Not that one.

26:19.957 --> 26:22.208
But they offered me the
lead in another series.

26:22.242 --> 26:23.543
That's great. Is it good?

26:23.577 --> 26:25.878
<i>- It's great.
- That's awesome.</i>

26:25.912 --> 26:28.998
But it shoots in new zealand.
