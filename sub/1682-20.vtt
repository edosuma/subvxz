00:01.269 --> 00:03.588
Kids, everyone
has one or two moments

00:03.624 --> 00:05.233
when they make a huge,
crazy decision

00:05.257 --> 00:06.866
that changes their lives
forever.

00:07.189 --> 00:08.806
This is the story of mine.

00:09.127 --> 00:11.018
It all started
with a visit from my mom

00:11.049 --> 00:12.932
and her longtime boyfriend, Clint,

00:13.052 --> 00:15.036
who was always saying stuff like...
"Ted,

00:15.626 --> 00:19.548
Your mother is a very...
Very erotic woman.

00:19.572 --> 00:20.718
Please don't.

00:21.661 --> 00:24.231
As a painter, slash,
songwriter, slash,

00:24.490 --> 00:27.731
volunteer fear-fighter,
I find her...

00:28.145 --> 00:29.948
incredibly sexual.

00:31.284 --> 00:34.206
But you have your own sexual memories
with your mom, don't you?

00:34.320 --> 00:35.319
Please don't.

00:35.439 --> 00:37.961
Exiting her womb,
receiving her milk.

00:38.011 --> 00:38.942
You get me?

00:39.471 --> 00:40.673
Good.

00:43.345 --> 00:45.915
I cannot believe I am with that man.

00:46.257 --> 00:47.492
Mom, mom, it's ok.

00:47.539 --> 00:48.571
You don't have to settle.

00:48.622 --> 00:49.782
There are plenty of guys who...

00:49.796 --> 00:51.167
He is so cool!

00:51.918 --> 00:53.700
And he picked me!

00:57.214 --> 00:58.143
Well, I'm, uh...

00:58.144 --> 00:59.778
I'm glad you're both so happy.

00:59.779 --> 01:02.840
Well, good, because we do
have an announcement...

01:04.084 --> 01:05.471
Son.

01:06.020 --> 01:16.198

<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:19.732 --> 01:21.427
Yes, my mom was lapping me.

01:21.479 --> 01:22.962
Getting married
for a second time

01:23.012 --> 01:24.453
before I was even married once.

01:24.660 --> 01:26.152
I was so happy for them.

01:26.272 --> 01:28.287
So freaking happy.

01:28.621 --> 01:30.414
Still, weddings can be magical.

01:30.534 --> 01:33.885
For all I knew, I'd end up sharing
a dance with my future wife there.

01:34.199 --> 01:36.924
And if you don't boil
those jam jars,

01:37.044 --> 01:39.737
it's just a welcome mat
for bacteria.

01:39.857 --> 01:41.136
That wasn't her.

01:42.732 --> 01:44.587
Oh, congratulations!
Oh!

01:44.607 --> 01:46.276
We are so happy for you.

01:46.396 --> 01:48.605
I feel like I'm 19 again. Oh.

01:48.640 --> 01:51.803
It's like the last 35 years
of my life never happened.

01:51.923 --> 01:54.267
So wonderful to hear, mom.

01:55.354 --> 01:59.437
Son, to show that your mom and I
will always be there for you,

02:00.172 --> 02:04.517
I want you to have this beautiful picture
that I painted.

02:06.185 --> 02:08.268
Kids, there was no guitar.

02:08.507 --> 02:09.961
Excuse me, Ted.

02:10.978 --> 02:13.085
Best...Wedding...
E...ver.

02:15.698 --> 02:19.200
Hello, everyone.
Mahallow for being here with us.

02:20.462 --> 02:21.923
My entire life...

02:22.534 --> 02:24.196
Well, this life.

02:25.307 --> 02:28.053
I've waited
for a muse like Virginia.

02:29.269 --> 02:30.498
Baby...

02:31.679 --> 02:33.389
this is your song.

02:37.689 --> 02:42.004
* When I squeeze her trembling bosom *
Oh, God...

02:42.124 --> 02:45.790
* The blood pumps to my loins *

02:46.787 --> 02:49.533
* When I penetrate
her...*

02:49.578 --> 02:52.609
Kids, I swear to God, I blacked
out for the next 12 minutes.

02:52.729 --> 02:55.727
So I have no idea how the song
got to this ending.

02:55.847 --> 02:57.956
* And Mahatma Gandhi *

02:58.076 --> 03:00.465
* And the pancakes * Everyone!

03:00.533 --> 03:03.128
* And the dragon *

03:03.635 --> 03:07.335
* And you *

03:11.611 --> 03:14.322
Guys, guys! Guess what
Robin just did.

03:14.873 --> 03:17.661
* Red and true...*

03:17.910 --> 03:19.796
Are you crying?

03:20.253 --> 03:21.920
I know it's stupid, but...

03:22.040 --> 03:26.185
Everyone!
* And the dragon...*

03:26.402 --> 03:28.216
They're happy, you know?

03:29.884 --> 03:31.915
Not as happy as I am, Robin.

03:33.127 --> 03:35.925
Guys, guys! Guess what
Robin just did.

03:36.370 --> 03:39.976
And then, I told you guys
what Robin just did,

03:39.997 --> 03:41.340
but you were there for that.

03:41.877 --> 03:43.342
I gotta tell the rest
of the wedding.

03:43.462 --> 03:44.934
Aunt Meredith!

03:45.945 --> 03:47.944
Kids, I can't overstate

03:47.976 --> 03:50.159
how horrible it is
to be the single guy

03:50.222 --> 03:51.950
at your own mother's
second wedding.

03:52.070 --> 03:54.423
So, Ted, when's your wedding?

03:54.543 --> 03:56.269
So, Ted, when's your wedding?

03:56.389 --> 03:58.186
When's your wedding?
When's your wedding?

03:58.306 --> 03:59.616
When's your wedding?

03:59.676 --> 04:01.950
Robin cried at Clint's song.

04:02.070 --> 04:03.715
Oh, I told you already.

04:03.746 --> 04:05.230
Ted's hot sister, Heather!

04:06.177 --> 04:07.232
I have to leave.

04:07.333 --> 04:09.639
Wait, Ted.
What about your toast?

04:09.759 --> 04:11.284
Make up some emergency
or something. I just...

04:11.320 --> 04:12.567
I-I can't handle this.

04:12.610 --> 04:14.973
Ted, Ted, where are you going?
It's your mother's wedding!

04:14.974 --> 04:17.116
Uncle Larry, my hand to God.

04:17.236 --> 04:19.043
Niagra Falls.

04:19.610 --> 04:20.557
She's pouring.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.571
And my friends didn't see me
for the next 72 hours.

04:23.799 --> 04:25.384
Seriously, is Ted okay?

04:25.434 --> 04:27.438
I mean, I know it was
a rough weekend, but...

04:27.751 --> 04:30.255
- this radio silence is weird.
- I know.

04:30.272 --> 04:33.137
His mom's called, like, five times
asking where he disappeared to.

04:33.158 --> 04:35.570
Sorry, Robin.
They're all out of pretzels.

04:35.690 --> 04:38.327
And I know how
emotional you get.

04:39.474 --> 04:40.904
Shh.

04:41.367 --> 04:42.749
Shh. Let it go.

04:43.258 --> 04:44.647
Let it go.
Okay!

04:44.767 --> 04:45.951
Shh.
Okay, I...

04:45.952 --> 04:47.456
I cried at Clint's song.

04:47.491 --> 04:49.051
She cried at Clint's song.

04:49.171 --> 04:51.644
- Hey, guys.
- Ted, where have you been?

04:51.684 --> 04:52.559
Are you okay?

04:52.580 --> 04:55.716
Oh, I'm better than okay.
I am on top of the world. Come on.

04:55.836 --> 04:57.454
We're going for a ride!

04:59.235 --> 05:01.820
Hey, buddy, do you want to, maybe,
let somebody

05:01.873 --> 05:04.314
who isn't having some sort
of manic episode drive for a while?

05:04.434 --> 05:06.544
Yeah, and where the hell
are we going?

05:06.791 --> 05:09.734
First, let me tell you what happened
the night of the wedding.

05:10.302 --> 05:11.846
Watching my mom get married,

05:11.881 --> 05:14.620
I realized how far behind
I was in my own life.

05:14.740 --> 05:16.310
I just had to get out of there.

05:16.430 --> 05:18.870
So I went back to my hotel room
and got onto this Web site

05:18.917 --> 05:20.495
I sometimes visit
when I can't sleep...

05:20.543 --> 05:23.200
Oh! Oh! Oh-oh! Ted,
come on. Oh, God. T.M.I.

05:23.221 --> 05:26.233
We do not want to know what you
and the Internet do when you're lonely.

05:26.278 --> 05:27.333
I didn't... I...

05:27.665 --> 05:30.774
That's not the part of the night
I was talking about.

05:32.177 --> 05:34.374
I went to my favorite
real estate auction site...

05:34.427 --> 05:35.621
Come on, we've all got one...

05:35.741 --> 05:37.909
scrolled through
a few properties and...

05:39.038 --> 05:40.843
Guys...

05:40.911 --> 05:43.485
I just bought my dream house.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.135
What do you mean
you bought this house?

05:50.175 --> 05:51.946
I mean, I made a bid online.

05:52.066 --> 05:54.217
I won the auction the next day
and I got approval.

05:54.265 --> 05:56.060
I just finalized the paperwork.

05:56.180 --> 05:59.066
And was the Blair Witch
easy to deal with,

05:59.101 --> 06:01.250
Or did she haggle
over the closing costs?

06:01.268 --> 06:02.873
Don't even joke about that, man.

06:03.561 --> 06:05.313
So, I'm thinking this room
will be the study.

06:05.352 --> 06:06.790
You know, a place just for Dad.

06:06.841 --> 06:08.000
I mean, the kids
are welcome in here

06:08.036 --> 06:09.929
if they're reading
a book, but no toys.

06:10.128 --> 06:11.798
It's not a question
of withholding love.

06:11.843 --> 06:13.520
It's a question
of drawing boundaries.

06:13.580 --> 06:14.480
Whoa.

06:14.501 --> 06:16.076
Ted, this is insane.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.810
This is going to take years

06:17.870 --> 06:20.441
and a small fortune
to make livable.

06:20.462 --> 06:22.659
I'm an architect.
I'll find a way.

06:22.688 --> 06:24.806
And if I start right now,
it'll be done by the time

06:24.833 --> 06:26.522
the ol' wifey and I
are ready to move in.

06:29.998 --> 06:32.402
Is she in the room
with us right now, Ted?

06:33.049 --> 06:36.023
Okay, okay, I know
I haven't found Mrs. Mosby yet,

06:36.068 --> 06:37.886
but I will, knock on wood.

06:38.446 --> 06:40.208
Careful, buddy.

06:40.328 --> 06:45.078
Ted, you can't just skip ahead
to where you think your life should be.

06:45.103 --> 06:46.139
Doesn't work that way.

06:46.171 --> 06:49.254
Yeah, I gotta agree. This may be
the stupidest thing you've ever done.

06:49.374 --> 06:51.118
Stupidest thing any of us has
ever done.

06:51.128 --> 06:52.024
Okay, all right.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.534
- Let's lay off Ted, all right?
- Thank you.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.494
Alright? We've all done some
stupid things in our lives.

06:55.537 --> 06:57.297
For example, I remember a time

06:57.357 --> 06:59.401
when I dropped some
bottle rockets in the toilet,

06:59.432 --> 07:02.354
and I tried to dry them
off in the microwave.

07:02.717 --> 07:04.583
God, you must have been
drunk off your ass.

07:04.633 --> 07:08.035
No, too stupid to be an adult.
He was obviously a kid when it happened.

07:08.073 --> 07:10.583
- Kid? Why...
- Throw rockets in the...

07:10.614 --> 07:13.062
Oh, my God, guys!
Great new game:

07:13.335 --> 07:15.645
"Drunk or Kid."
Which one was I?

07:15.687 --> 07:16.765
Lock in your guesses.

07:16.813 --> 07:17.656
Drunk. Drunk. Kid.

07:17.693 --> 07:19.307
Kid.
Drumroll, please.

07:23.505 --> 07:25.085
I was...

07:26.629 --> 07:27.510
Drunk!

07:30.347 --> 07:32.497
You know, I'm glad
Robin got it right.

07:32.826 --> 07:35.489
Cause she's very sensitive and fragile.

07:36.704 --> 07:41.077
I'm referencing the time
she cried at Clint's song.

07:41.406 --> 07:43.396
And even though I'm whispering,

07:43.516 --> 07:45.462
I actually hope she hears me.

07:45.478 --> 07:47.715
- It wasn't me!
- What?

07:48.067 --> 07:50.751
I'm not the one who cried
at Clint's song.

07:54.919 --> 07:56.976
Are you... crying?

07:57.323 --> 07:59.355
I know it's stupid, but...
Everyone!

07:59.475 --> 08:02.617
* And the dragon...*

08:03.168 --> 08:05.153
They're just happy, you know?

08:05.221 --> 08:07.948
Not as happy as I am.

08:08.068 --> 08:10.824
I will give you $500 if this just
happened to you instead of me.

08:10.944 --> 08:12.586
500 bucks? Deal.

08:12.907 --> 08:14.389
Thank you, Robin.

08:14.509 --> 08:17.638
You just saved me unspeakable public
humiliation and shame.

08:18.347 --> 08:19.532
Guys! Guys!

08:20.050 --> 08:21.843
Guess what Robin just did.

08:23.478 --> 08:25.406
Wait, you guys are...

08:25.526 --> 08:27.208
Hi, I'm here
for the inspection.

08:27.309 --> 08:29.324
Oh, great! I was worried
you weren't coming.

08:29.444 --> 08:32.278
I was actually here a few minutes ago,
but I guess the doorbell doesn't work.

08:32.332 --> 08:34.116
Hmm.
Oh, hey!

08:34.914 --> 08:37.743
Doorbell does not work.

08:39.496 --> 08:43.456
Wait, wait. You're just getting
this place inspected now?

08:43.493 --> 08:44.253
Well, yeah.

08:44.302 --> 08:45.244
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

08:45.286 --> 08:47.487
Okay! All right!

08:48.284 --> 08:50.521
All right, let's all remember
that we've all done

08:50.550 --> 08:52.051
some stupid things
in our lives, okay?

08:52.089 --> 08:54.477
For example, I once
tried to ride my bike down

08:54.507 --> 08:57.212
an extension ladder from
the roof of a two-story house.

08:58.176 --> 09:00.124
The only looming question is

09:01.109 --> 09:02.870
Was I drunk or a kid?

09:02.958 --> 09:04.719
Drunk! Kid! Kid! Drunk!

09:04.839 --> 09:05.924
Drumroll, please.

09:09.132 --> 09:10.376
I was...

09:10.410 --> 09:12.035
Marshall's dead!

09:12.391 --> 09:14.218
Marshall's dead!

09:14.338 --> 09:16.113
- A kid.
- Marshall!

09:18.072 --> 09:19.520
Moms, right?

09:19.640 --> 09:21.508
Just always
making a big deal out of nothing.

09:22.518 --> 09:23.963
*** under a week.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.342
Hey, let's check out the porch, huh?

09:26.462 --> 09:28.125
Come on.

09:28.245 --> 09:29.742
I'm going to put
a grill out here.

09:29.785 --> 09:31.216
Every Sunday, right here,

09:31.237 --> 09:32.960
it's going to be
a total sausage fest.

09:33.619 --> 09:35.230
Hmm...
Sausage party?

09:35.350 --> 09:36.881
Burgers, we'll do burgers.

09:37.001 --> 09:41.011
Ted, stop it. You can't keep this house.
It's a huge mistake.

09:41.032 --> 09:42.317
Lily, listen to me.

09:42.534 --> 09:45.073
I had a plan, okay?
Wife, house, kids.

09:45.193 --> 09:47.011
As it turns out, the Universe

09:47.077 --> 09:49.551
it's being kind of a ***
about the whole wife and kids part.

09:49.607 --> 09:51.089
So, what's the one
thing I can control?

09:51.361 --> 09:53.655
The house. I bought it.

09:53.775 --> 09:55.652
- It's not a huge mistake.
- Exactly.

09:55.772 --> 09:59.329
Now, me driving my brother's car
the wrong way down I-94,

09:59.637 --> 10:01.305
that was a huge mistake.

10:02.476 --> 10:04.020
Drunk! Kid! Kid! Kid!

10:04.082 --> 10:05.198
I was...

10:07.851 --> 10:09.080
A kid.

10:10.114 --> 10:11.367
Yes!

10:13.555 --> 10:15.064
Wow, Barney.

10:15.184 --> 10:16.896
Did you cry on that
guy or something?

10:16.953 --> 10:19.133
Yeah. You got leaky pipes.

10:19.253 --> 10:20.442
But the bright side:

10:20.562 --> 10:24.155
the pond in your basement is drowning
some of the larger, slower rats.

10:24.500 --> 10:27.966
The rest of them, well...
they're headed this way.

10:29.829 --> 10:33.229
See, you should have waited to find out
the problems with this house.

10:33.269 --> 10:35.339
You can always find problems
with any decision,

10:35.352 --> 10:36.805
but you can't
let that stop you.

10:36.925 --> 10:40.370
Freshman year, Marshall knew right away
he wanted to spend his life with you.

10:40.490 --> 10:43.408
What if someone had been there
to second-guess that decision?

10:44.543 --> 10:45.594
Bye.

10:48.779 --> 10:53.670
I know we've only been on two dates, but
dammit, Lily Aldrin, I'm gonna marry you.

10:53.790 --> 10:54.951
Not so fast.

10:59.246 --> 11:01.048
We got some
structural issues here.

11:01.168 --> 11:04.690
These hips are not
Eriksen baby-compliant.

11:04.810 --> 11:06.161
And this thing right here

11:06.217 --> 11:08.118
does not have a proper filter.

11:08.238 --> 11:10.786
That's a maintenance issue
that's never going to go away.

11:11.171 --> 11:15.085
And I know you think that you
like this Gothic exterior now

11:15.205 --> 11:19.325
But deep down, didn't you always
picture yourself in something Spanish?

11:20.287 --> 11:22.535
I'd recommend you look
into the rental option.

11:23.919 --> 11:25.827
But Marshall took that leap of faith,

11:25.947 --> 11:27.732
and it's the best thing
that ever happened to you both.

11:29.813 --> 11:31.608
It was Robin!

11:32.524 --> 11:33.700
"What?!"

11:33.820 --> 11:36.723
Yes, it was Robin
who cried at Clint's song!

11:36.742 --> 11:38.789
But she said...I know what she said.

11:38.821 --> 11:40.670
But here's what
she didn't want you to know.

11:41.866 --> 11:43.395
Listen, Barney,

11:43.736 --> 11:46.566
I can't stand all these jokes
about me crying.

11:46.906 --> 11:49.132
If I pretend to reveal
that you were the one who cried,

11:49.158 --> 11:50.061
will you go along with it?

11:51.135 --> 11:52.132
Sure.

11:53.277 --> 11:55.598
I made a mistake
letting you go, didn't I?

11:57.456 --> 11:59.371
Your penis is enormous.

12:00.512 --> 12:03.341
- Dude, you almost had us.
- You always take it one too far.

12:03.371 --> 12:04.607
Dammit.

12:05.142 --> 12:06.722
All right, good news.

12:06.778 --> 12:08.385
- Think we'll be out of here early.
- Really?

12:08.412 --> 12:11.372
Yep, I finished downstairs
and the outside.

12:11.394 --> 12:13.786
Now, I could keep looking
and see what else I can find

12:13.811 --> 12:16.700
besides the black mold,
the damaged retaining wall,

12:16.748 --> 12:18.019
the frayed electrical wires,

12:18.139 --> 12:19.834
the lead paint,
the water damage,

12:19.865 --> 12:21.286
the fire damage,
the sun damage,

12:21.406 --> 12:23.429
the broken furnace,
the rotted floorboards...

12:23.463 --> 12:24.991
Oh, look at that. No termites.

12:25.384 --> 12:27.185
The cracked chimney,
the bats, the rats,

12:27.212 --> 12:29.125
the spiders,
the raccoons, the hobo,

12:29.245 --> 12:30.379
the detached gutter,

12:30.499 --> 12:32.933
the outdated fuse box and
the paint job in the kitchen,

12:32.969 --> 12:36.517
which is fine, but the trim
really clashes with the countertops.

12:36.729 --> 12:38.152
Or I could just recommend

12:38.184 --> 12:41.600
that you do not buy this godforsaken
Guantanamo Bay of a house,

12:41.631 --> 12:43.775
and suggest that we all
get our asses out of here

12:43.800 --> 12:46.311
before a medium-sized wind
blows the whole sumbitch down.

12:49.028 --> 12:52.431
What if I already
bought the sum'bitch?

12:55.291 --> 12:57.591
I- I will check out the upstairs.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.118
Did he say he found a hobo?

13:07.888 --> 13:10.406
Ok, yes. There are problems.

13:10.438 --> 13:13.672
But I see this house for what I know it can be.

13:13.997 --> 13:16.359
I see a swing
on that tree outside.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.942
I- I see a wreath
on the front door at Christmas.

13:19.365 --> 13:20.665
I see a grill

13:20.785 --> 13:23.631
out on that patio where I'll be
barbecuing every weekend.

13:24.673 --> 13:28.191
I see a life that I know
I can have here.

13:34.989 --> 13:36.429
I see a lawsuit.

13:37.712 --> 13:39.227
Found termites.

13:45.681 --> 13:48.910
Hey, well, the good news is the inspector
killed some roaches on impact.

13:49.030 --> 13:50.714
Oh, hold on.

13:51.151 --> 13:54.440
Giant pole in second floor.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.781
Just wanted to make sure
the report is thorough.

13:59.344 --> 14:00.781
You were right.

14:01.072 --> 14:03.414
This was a huge mistake.
It's just...

14:04.546 --> 14:05.769
Everyone's moving on but me.

14:05.795 --> 14:09.384
You guys got a place years ago;
Robin's getting serious with Don.

14:09.885 --> 14:11.987
Barney...Maybe that's a new tie?

14:12.021 --> 14:13.470
Thank you. Geez.

14:14.586 --> 14:16.251
Now my mom is remarried.

14:17.425 --> 14:20.580
I... I'm exactly where I was
five years ago. I'm sick of it. I'm...

14:21.672 --> 14:24.310
I'm ready for the life
that fits into this house.

14:25.746 --> 14:27.084
It's all right, buddy.

14:28.198 --> 14:31.341
Sometimes people make
the wrong decisions in life.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.588
Like your mother.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.399
What do you mean?

14:36.976 --> 14:39.848
Ted, as you know, I've always been

14:39.893 --> 14:42.380
very, very fond of your mother.

14:42.427 --> 14:43.045
Please don't.

14:43.114 --> 14:47.060
In fact, Virginia and I shared
a special moment back in

14:47.180 --> 14:49.215
2006 B.C....

14:49.878 --> 14:51.689
Before Clint.

14:51.809 --> 14:53.552
What the hell are
you talking about?

14:54.083 --> 14:56.090
I wanted to be your dad!

14:56.974 --> 14:59.108
- What does that even mean?
- Don't you talk back to me, young man.

14:59.791 --> 15:02.737
That's why I cried at Clint's song.

15:02.807 --> 15:05.347
Because that bastard
took her away from me.

15:05.391 --> 15:07.926
And now, all I'm left with...

15:08.430 --> 15:11.493
is the memory of dropping
her off at the airport.

15:13.543 --> 15:15.581
And that's how you
got the brooch?

15:15.914 --> 15:17.215
Unbelievable.

15:18.672 --> 15:20.110
You...

15:22.286 --> 15:24.685
So...Here we are.

15:26.048 --> 15:27.672
Here we are.

15:29.743 --> 15:32.298
We made good time...
Not a lot of traffic...

15:36.733 --> 15:38.211
Oh, I love this song.

15:38.331 --> 15:39.330
Do you?
Hmm.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.679
I can...

15:47.546 --> 15:49.474
Listen...

15:49.745 --> 15:51.212
Ted's mom.

15:51.671 --> 15:53.138
I...

15:53.387 --> 15:55.613
should really...I sh...

15:58.444 --> 16:01.722
* Workin' on our night moves *

16:02.704 --> 16:06.873
* Tryin' to make some
front-page drivin' news *

16:06.993 --> 16:09.912
* Workin' on our night moves *

16:11.067 --> 16:13.930
Your penis is enormous.

16:14.750 --> 16:16.703
Again?! Always one too far!

16:16.735 --> 16:18.482
Okay, all right.
Fine, that last part I made up,

16:18.492 --> 16:20.379
but the rest of it,
I swear it was true.

16:20.426 --> 16:22.540
Come on, dude.
Your mom is a cougar.

16:22.590 --> 16:25.056
Wait, I thought you said
a cougar can't be over 50.

16:25.107 --> 16:27.348
Okay, she's a Mellencamp.

16:28.215 --> 16:31.611
Guys, I am screwed. I mean, the best
I can do is level this place

16:31.653 --> 16:33.990
and sell the property
for a huge loss.

16:34.110 --> 16:35.597
Look, Ted...

16:36.043 --> 16:39.789
Usually in life when you make a stupid
decision you just have to live with it.

16:40.284 --> 16:44.746
But how often do you get the chance
to pick up a sledgehammer

16:44.866 --> 16:47.156
and bash the living hell
out of it?

16:49.000 --> 16:55.074

16:59.940 --> 17:02.781
- This is stupid.
- Your mom and I got to second base.

17:05.222 --> 17:07.406
* I'll light the fire *

17:08.334 --> 17:12.685
* You place the flowers
in the vase *

17:12.805 --> 17:16.888
* That you bought today *

17:26.762 --> 17:29.458
Thanks, Lily.
That felt fantastic.

17:29.852 --> 17:32.412
To Ted Mosby-
homeowner,

17:32.454 --> 17:36.356
friend, and if he can
rent it out, slumlord.

17:40.692 --> 17:41.722
There's, uh...

17:42.596 --> 17:44.626
There's one last thing I gotta do.

17:44.896 --> 17:47.925
And my friends didn't see me
for the next 72 hours.

17:49.371 --> 17:50.531
He was our ride.

17:57.865 --> 18:01.216
- Hi.
- Ted, what are you doing here?

18:01.695 --> 18:03.631
I never got to give
you guys your toast.

18:03.982 --> 18:07.625
I was selfish and I freaked out
and I'm so sorry, so...

18:08.388 --> 18:09.532
Here it is...

18:11.688 --> 18:14.394
"How bout a hand for the deejay?
Gesture to dee..."

18:15.327 --> 18:16.940
I'll skip down.

18:17.939 --> 18:19.417
"Mom, I love you,

18:20.125 --> 18:22.529
"and I've never seen you
as happy as you are with Clint.

18:23.341 --> 18:25.620
"And, Clint, welcome to the family...

18:27.154 --> 18:29.735
"What you two have
is what I one day hope to find."

18:31.453 --> 18:33.441
But until then, cheers to you both.

18:34.481 --> 18:35.668
I love you, guys.

18:36.975 --> 18:37.943
Ted...

18:40.358 --> 18:42.460
I am so...

18:43.761 --> 18:45.548
baked right now.

18:46.849 --> 18:50.336
I'm only 60% sure you're actually
standing in front of me.

18:50.456 --> 18:54.070
But if you are, I love you.

18:55.538 --> 18:58.109
And you are the best son
a mother could ever have.

19:11.714 --> 19:14.791
There was no logical reason why
my mother should be with a guy like that.

19:15.181 --> 19:16.909
And yet, as you kids know,

19:17.029 --> 19:20.515
being with your Grandpa Clint was
the best decision your grandma ever made.

19:25.303 --> 19:27.298
Sometimes our best decisions
are the ones

19:27.342 --> 19:28.755
that don't make
any sense at all.

19:37.953 --> 19:40.087
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

19:40.127 --> 19:41.709
How did you know I was
gonna be up here today?

19:42.109 --> 19:43.149
Robin told me.

19:45.273 --> 19:46.216
Happy housewarming.

19:47.808 --> 19:51.014
But I-I, I told you the last time
I saw you I'm selling the place.

19:51.719 --> 19:53.041
I know what you said.

19:54.185 --> 19:56.642
I also know my best
friend, Ted Mosby.

19:57.415 --> 19:58.216
Look...

19:58.336 --> 20:01.942
Of all the times over the years
when I've said to you

20:02.763 --> 20:05.032
"Slow down! Don't rush
into things with this girl."

20:05.152 --> 20:07.746
you haven't listened to me
a single damn time.

20:09.744 --> 20:12.215
Your heart is both
drunk and a kid.

20:17.567 --> 20:20.304
- Thanks for sticking up for me, man.
- That's what I do.

20:23.827 --> 20:26.480
Can I... Can I tell you some
of the ideas I have?

20:26.929 --> 20:27.970
Yeah.

20:29.026 --> 20:30.982
And, kids, Marshall was right.

20:31.102 --> 20:32.917
I didn't give up
on my dream house

20:33.037 --> 20:35.175
because that's the thing
about stupid decisions:

20:35.384 --> 20:36.716
We all make them.

20:36.929 --> 20:38.403
But time is funny.

20:41.802 --> 20:43.715
And sometimes a little magic...

20:45.775 --> 20:47.566
It can take
a stupid decision...

20:48.794 --> 20:51.219
...and turn it
into something else entirely.

20:52.436 --> 20:54.672
Because, kids, as you know,

20:56.118 --> 20:57.242
That house....

20:59.412 --> 21:00.911
is this house.
