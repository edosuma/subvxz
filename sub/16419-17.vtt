00:26.867 --> 00:28.632
- Uh-huh, there, see that?

00:28.633 --> 00:30.032
Every time I move

00:30.033 --> 00:31.399
my battle ax quits workin'.

00:31.400 --> 00:32.832
- Got it.

00:32.833 --> 00:33.800
Every time Trip moves
that blue thing,

00:33.801 --> 00:36.200
his battle ax quits working.

00:38.100 --> 00:40.066
- Hudson...
- Yeah?

00:40.067 --> 00:42.832

onto a juice box.

00:42.833 --> 00:45.033
- Whaddaya mean a juice b...?

00:46.033 --> 00:48.533
Whooaa... where'd my phone go?

01:03.233 --> 01:05.266
Hey, I found a couple
problems with our game.

01:05.267 --> 01:08.266
- Yeah that's nice.
Try not to talk.

01:08.267 --> 01:11.166
- We're watching
an iCarly marathon.

01:11.167 --> 01:12.766
- Oh, oh, come on,
we got a lot of work to do.

01:12.767 --> 01:16.600
So... so we don't have time
to be watchin' some iCarly...

01:18.633 --> 01:19.633
iCarly marathon

01:23.100 --> 01:25.132
Look at the water shootin'

01:25.133 --> 01:26.333
Okay, I'll watch for a minute.

01:28.967 --> 01:31.533
- Hey, I found my phone
in the bathroom.

01:31.833 --> 01:35.232
- Oh all right!
I'm good. I'm good.

01:35.233 --> 01:37.666
- Just breathe me in.
Come on. Breathe me in.

01:37.667 --> 01:40.200
- What are you watching?
What is that, Knight Rider?

01:42.067 --> 01:43.732
- Noooo.
It's not Knight Rider.

01:43.733 --> 01:45.167
- It's iCarly.

01:48.967 --> 01:52.099
- Okay, I'll sit for a minute.

01:52.100 --> 01:54.066
- Hey!
What's the deal?!?

01:54.067 --> 01:56.099
- I'm sitting on your lap.

01:56.100 --> 01:58.567
- Well, that's not normal!

02:11.100 --> 02:13.067
- Did you and Sam kiss?!?

02:15.967 --> 02:18.066
Oh no!

02:18.067 --> 02:18.833
- Hey Trip!

02:18.834 --> 02:20.066

02:23.134 --> 02:25.633
- Hey Dub, can you
pipe yourself down?

02:26.833 --> 02:28.799
- Pipe myself?!?

02:28.800 --> 02:30.266
- Uh, sorry Dad...

02:30.267 --> 02:31.267
I think I'm gonna
stay here for a while

02:31.268 --> 02:32.832

02:32.833 --> 02:33.966

at Madison Square Garden?

02:40.200 --> 02:42.799
So you can sit here

02:45.967 --> 02:50.166
Aha!

03:27.667 --> 03:29.367
I'll order another cake.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.700

03:38.533 --> 03:40.499
- Attention...

03:40.500 --> 03:44.066
We apologize for Double G
not being here.

03:44.067 --> 03:44.967
- Well where is he?!?

03:44.968 --> 03:48.132
- Uhhh... well, we texted him,

03:48.133 --> 03:50.066
asking where he was,
and he wrote back:

03:50.067 --> 03:51.499
"Quit texting me.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.700
I'm watching
an iCarly marathon."

03:56.667 --> 03:58.066
- I hate you.

03:58.067 --> 03:59.433
- Hate you too.

04:00.700 --> 04:03.066

04:03.067 --> 04:05.066

04:05.067 --> 04:07.466
- Ahhhh!
That episode was so good!

04:07.467 --> 04:09.627
- I know! I swear, I could watch
this show all night...

04:11.367 --> 04:12.899
Whoa, it's almost
six in the morning!

04:12.900 --> 04:16.199
- Oh my God, I guess we did
watch iCarly all night.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.799
- Yeah.
Hey, wake up the boys, will ya?

04:17.800 --> 04:18.800
- 'Kay kay.

04:24.167 --> 04:26.700
Hey... hey wake up,
members of my nation...

04:28.167 --> 04:30.800
- Why?
Is it my time to be?

04:32.133 --> 04:34.533
- Oo, Grandma...
your mustache tickles.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.099
- Hey, you guys want coffee?

04:38.100 --> 04:40.566
- Yeah, I'll take some.

04:40.567 --> 04:43.567
- My mom says I can't have
coffee 'til after I'm married.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.066
- Holy butt, it's almost
six in the morning!

04:47.067 --> 04:50.432
- Yep, we watched iCarly
for twelve hours.

04:50.433 --> 04:51.932
- Almost twenty-three episodes.

04:51.933 --> 04:54.866
- Hey, did they ever reveal who
Freddie ended up liking?

04:54.867 --> 04:56.499
Carly or Sam?

04:56.500 --> 04:58.432
- Well no... but if you
really know the show,

04:58.433 --> 05:00.499
it's obvious.
- So obvious.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.166
- Freddie loves Sam.
- Freddie loves Carly.

05:02.167 --> 05:04.099
- What?!
- What!?

05:04.100 --> 05:06.732
Freddie was totally
in love with Carly.

05:06.733 --> 05:08.932
- No way!
Freddie was in love with Sam.

05:08.933 --> 05:12.233
- Okay well, that would be true
if you weren't wrong.

05:13.433 --> 05:15.066
- You give me one piece
of evidence

05:15.067 --> 05:16.366
that says Freddie loves Carly.

05:16.367 --> 05:19.499
- Uh, how about
the very first episode

05:19.500 --> 05:21.899
when Freddie said
these exact words to Carly:

05:21.900 --> 05:25.532
"I'm in love with you,
you just wanna be friends,

05:25.533 --> 05:27.499
and I'm totally cool living
with that constant pain."

05:27.500 --> 05:29.299
- Well sure, that's how he felt

05:29.300 --> 05:33.066
when he was a little boy,
only two feet tall. Pfft...

05:33.067 --> 05:34.632
- Okay...

05:34.633 --> 05:36.766
who did Freddie kiss
in the FINAL episode?

05:36.767 --> 05:38.566
- Well, that doesn't...
- Carly! Carly Shay!

05:38.567 --> 05:40.366
Wooooo, look who wins, I dooooo!

05:40.367 --> 05:42.366
Freddie loves Carly, baby!

05:42.367 --> 05:45.066
Yeah!
Just leave it all to me.

05:45.067 --> 05:48.532
Leave it all to me.

05:48.533 --> 05:52.066
Wait wait wait
wait wait wait wait!

05:52.067 --> 05:53.166
Who was Freddie's first kiss?

05:53.167 --> 05:56.066
- Gibbaaayyyyy.

05:56.067 --> 05:59.466
- No, it was not Gibby.
It was Sam.

05:59.467 --> 06:01.832
- Hey! If you really
wanna know

06:01.833 --> 06:03.599
if Freddie was in love
with Carly or Sam,

06:03.600 --> 06:05.832
why don't you go ask him?
- Ask who?

06:05.833 --> 06:07.199
- The guy who played Freddie
on the show.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.799
- Michael Phelps?

06:10.800 --> 06:12.166
- Noooooo!

06:12.167 --> 06:14.532
- Oh right, that guy just swims.

06:14.533 --> 06:17.066
- "Freddie" was played
by Nathan Kress.

06:17.067 --> 06:19.166
- Yep, and Nathan Kress is
here in New York right now

06:19.167 --> 06:21.566
doin' a play on Broadway.

06:21.567 --> 06:23.166
He's stayin' at...
the Four Stevens Hotel.

06:23.167 --> 06:25.599
- What?!?

06:25.600 --> 06:28.432
"Actor Nathan Kress
will be in New York

06:28.433 --> 06:30.532
through April, headlining
the Broadway production

06:30.533 --> 06:33.199
of "The Saliva Monologues."

06:33.200 --> 06:34.532
It opened last night.

06:34.533 --> 06:36.132
- Oh my God, we're only
a few miles away

06:36.133 --> 06:38.932
from the actual Freddie Benson.

06:38.933 --> 06:41.432
- Yep...

06:41.433 --> 06:43.632
so let's go to his hotel,
and ask him

06:43.633 --> 06:45.966
whether his character
was in love with Carly or Sam.

06:45.967 --> 06:46.967
- Let's do it.

06:49.067 --> 06:50.299
No... uh... No...

06:50.300 --> 06:51.967
- I know. We're gonna do it.

07:45.133 --> 07:48.232
- Yeah. Uh, we need the
room number for Nathan Kress.

07:48.233 --> 07:51.067
He's the boy who played
Freddie on iCarly!

07:53.733 --> 07:55.899
- Are you friends
with Mister Kress?

07:55.900 --> 07:58.399
- Well... No...
- Well, I mean kinda...

07:58.400 --> 08:01.366
but che... no.

08:01.367 --> 08:03.732
- I'm sorry, girls.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.232
But we have to respect
the privacy of our guests.

08:05.233 --> 08:06.266
- C'mon... y'know...

08:06.267 --> 08:09.199
we're all people here.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.332
- We are all people.

08:11.333 --> 08:12.832
- It's just...

08:12.833 --> 08:14.732
See, we're big fans
of iCarly, and um...

08:14.733 --> 08:16.632
we just need to ask
Nathan a quick question.

08:16.633 --> 08:18.332
- We just need to know
if his character Freddie

08:18.333 --> 08:19.499
was in love with Carly or S...

08:19.500 --> 08:21.732
- It's time for my snack.

08:21.733 --> 08:23.366
- What, no you can't...
- But no honestly we just need...

08:23.367 --> 08:25.733
- Ohhh.
- Awww.

08:27.500 --> 08:28.233
- You said they'd let us in.

08:28.234 --> 08:31.067
- I thought they would.

08:35.367 --> 08:39.166
- Whoa!
Uh, hello.

08:39.167 --> 08:40.966
Welcome to
the Four Stevens Hotel.

08:40.967 --> 08:42.466
- Thanks.

08:42.467 --> 08:43.899
I just need an extra key
to my friend's room.

08:43.900 --> 08:45.099
His name is Gary Wolf.

08:45.100 --> 08:48.666
- Do you have any identification
on you of any kind?

08:48.667 --> 08:51.366
- No.
- Doesn't matter.

08:51.367 --> 08:55.666
Here's the key
to Mister Wolf's room, 4F.

08:55.667 --> 08:58.332
The elevator's that way.

08:58.333 --> 09:00.700
- Thank you.
- Yeah ya do.

09:03.267 --> 09:05.399
- He let her right in!

09:05.400 --> 09:07.266
- And all she did
was ask for a key.

09:07.267 --> 09:08.566
- I know!

09:08.567 --> 09:11.132
- Well... okay then...

09:11.133 --> 09:13.232
Watch this.

09:13.233 --> 09:15.200
- What are you...?
What? Oh. Oh no.

09:18.067 --> 09:19.432
- A'hem...

09:19.433 --> 09:24.932
A'hem!
- Yeah, what?

09:24.933 --> 09:26.432
- See uh, I just need an extra
key to my friend's room.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.899
His name is Nathan Kress.

09:28.900 --> 09:32.199
- Get outta here
or I'm calling the cops.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.599
- But dude!

09:33.600 --> 09:34.799
You just let
that last girl in here.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.767
- Yeah, what's the difference
between her and us?

09:39.967 --> 09:41.499
- Yeah, okay, we get it.
- Okay. Geez Louise.

09:41.500 --> 09:42.967
I guess this is how
the world works.

09:44.967 --> 09:46.067
- Hey!

09:49.600 --> 09:51.899
"Please leave
the Four Stevens Hotel.

09:51.900 --> 09:54.199
Or else, I will have to
spray you in the face

09:54.200 --> 09:55.432
with this can."

09:55.433 --> 09:57.199
- Okay, seriously?

09:57.200 --> 09:59.399
- You're really gonna
spray us with pepper spray?

09:59.400 --> 10:01.066
- Nah.

10:01.067 --> 10:03.466
This is made with cilantro,

10:03.467 --> 10:04.832
this doesn't hurt the eyes

10:04.833 --> 10:06.632
nearly as much
as pepper spray does.

10:06.633 --> 10:08.466
- Well guess what,
we don't care.

10:08.467 --> 10:09.933
- And we're not leaving.

10:11.267 --> 10:14.099
- Oh...
- Ow...

10:14.100 --> 10:16.632
- That's... that's unpleasant.
- That was not very nice.

10:16.633 --> 10:18.666
- We're just teenage girls,
why bother us?

10:18.667 --> 10:20.032
- Which way's the door?
- I think it's this way.

10:20.033 --> 10:24.266
Keep going straight.
- Okay, yep, okay...

10:24.267 --> 10:25.932
- Thank you sir!

10:25.933 --> 10:28.667

the iCarly marathon.

11:35.467 --> 11:36.766
- And having
a spaghetti-taco party!

11:36.767 --> 11:38.599

11:45.333 --> 11:46.399
Carly or Sam?

11:46.400 --> 11:47.367
- Yeah, did you find out?

11:47.368 --> 11:48.766
- Noooo.

11:48.767 --> 11:50.699
All we got was sprayed,
in our faces.

11:50.700 --> 11:52.366
- You mean pepper spray?

11:52.367 --> 11:54.499
- No. Cilantro.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.199
- Ohoooh.

11:56.200 --> 11:59.432
You all must have been
at The Four Stevens Hotel.

11:59.433 --> 12:03.099
- We've been sprayed there.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.899
- Well now how are
you gonna find out

12:04.900 --> 12:06.566
if Freddie was in love
with Carly or Sam?

12:06.567 --> 12:07.932
- I don't know.
- But I'll tell ya this,

12:07.933 --> 12:11.166
there's no way we're gonna get
to Nathan Kress at that hotel.

12:11.167 --> 12:12.366
- Nope.

12:12.367 --> 12:14.166
- Ha!!!

12:14.167 --> 12:16.832
- Okay, why the very short,
loud laugh?

12:16.833 --> 12:18.299
- 'Cuz I can get
to Nathan Kress... easy.

12:18.300 --> 12:22.066
- Oh, you mean 'cuz
you're a big celebrity?

12:22.067 --> 12:23.132
- Noooo.

12:23.133 --> 12:25.067
Because I'm smarter
than you children.

12:29.433 --> 12:30.832
Hey Bunny, Ruthless!
Let's go!

12:30.833 --> 12:32.233
We gotta go meet Nathan Kress.

12:33.467 --> 12:35.766
Whoa wait,
what about these ladies?

12:35.767 --> 12:37.799
- Oh! Well tell the little ones
to stay here

12:37.800 --> 12:40.566
and the big ones,
let's go for a ride!

12:40.567 --> 12:42.100
- Come on, big ones!

12:47.833 --> 12:49.866
- Yo, that's messed up

12:49.867 --> 12:51.132
that you two couldn't
figure out a way

12:51.133 --> 12:53.232
to get to Nathan Kress.
- Oh really?

12:53.233 --> 12:55.699
- And how would you get past
the hotel security?

12:55.700 --> 12:59.266
- Easy. I'd just show
up with my good buddy...

12:59.267 --> 13:01.899
Nathan Kress.

13:01.900 --> 13:04.366
- Mmmmm, your arm's warm.

13:04.367 --> 13:05.832
- What?

13:05.833 --> 13:07.066
- Okay, what are you saying?

13:07.067 --> 13:10.866
- That Hudson looks a lot
like Freddie from iCarly.

13:10.867 --> 13:13.599
- No he doesn't.
Nathan Kress has dark hair.

13:13.600 --> 13:14.666
- And muscles.

13:14.667 --> 13:16.399
- I have muscles.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.132
- Your head's a muscle!

13:18.133 --> 13:19.466
- Well, all I gotta do is
call my dad's makeup artist,

13:19.467 --> 13:22.532
she can make Hudson look exactly
like Freddie from iCarly.

13:22.533 --> 13:25.232
- Yeah.
You try that.

13:25.233 --> 13:26.732
- Maybe I will.

13:26.733 --> 13:28.599
- Yay, I get to be
Freddie Benson!

13:28.600 --> 13:30.666
I get to be Freddie.

13:30.667 --> 13:35.133
Yo soy Freddie.
Yo soy Freddie.

13:36.300 --> 13:37.466
Freddie! Freddie!
Woo!

13:37.467 --> 13:39.067
Freddie Freddie Freddie!

13:48.733 --> 13:51.732
- Okay, we're in the lobby.
You all right in there?

13:51.733 --> 13:53.866
- No, I'm hot and I'm sweating.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.466
- Okay!
You'll be all right.

13:55.467 --> 13:56.699
Kenzie, how you doin'?

13:56.700 --> 13:57.500
- I can barely breathe in here!

13:57.501 --> 14:00.067
- All right, hold on...

14:07.467 --> 14:08.300
- Okay, that's enough.

14:08.301 --> 14:10.133
- No no no, just a little more!

14:12.300 --> 14:13.100
- Okay.

14:13.101 --> 14:15.067
Now, wait here so I can do this.

14:17.067 --> 14:18.899
All right, Nathan Kress...

14:18.900 --> 14:21.200
let's get you a new room key.

14:24.067 --> 14:25.699
- Okay. But I'm
a busy celebrity,

14:25.700 --> 14:27.133
so let's do this quickly.

14:31.600 --> 14:35.400
- Ohhhh!!!
What's happening?!?

14:36.667 --> 14:38.066
- Hi, welcome
to The Four Stevens.

14:38.067 --> 14:40.132
- Mmm yes. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

14:40.133 --> 14:42.466
Uh, my boss here, Nathan Kress,

14:42.467 --> 14:44.299
he needs another key
to his room.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.432
- Oh. Uhhh...

14:47.433 --> 14:48.233
What's your room number?

14:48.234 --> 14:52.866
Uh, I think I'm staying in...

14:52.867 --> 14:54.666
Five... four...
three... two...?

14:54.667 --> 14:58.066
- Oh my gosh,

14:58.067 --> 15:00.100
I love when you say that
on your show.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.232
- Thanks. What show?
- Ahh! Uh!

15:03.233 --> 15:07.466
- Okay, I see we have you
in room eight-D.

15:07.467 --> 15:08.632
- Ah yes. Perfect.

15:08.633 --> 15:10.166
Uh Nathan, I'll meet you
by the elevator.

15:10.167 --> 15:11.900
- Who's Nathan?
- That way!

15:15.600 --> 15:18.132
- Oh! Hey! Hey! Sir!

15:18.133 --> 15:20.899
There's a...
There's a pers... Hey, hey!

15:20.900 --> 15:22.599
I hear they're givin' away
free ham outside.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.933
Yeah. Exciting.

15:26.833 --> 15:28.567
- What's happening
- Ow!

15:40.067 --> 15:41.632
- Hey, guys!

15:41.633 --> 15:42.733
Let me outta this suitcase!

15:50.467 --> 15:52.332
- Geez Louise,
you didn't have to

15:52.333 --> 15:54.099
leave us in there for so long!

15:54.100 --> 15:56.066
- And why did
you fill our suitcases

15:56.067 --> 15:58.267
with socks and boy underwear?!?

15:59.867 --> 16:02.166
- Hey! You guys!
Look...

16:02.167 --> 16:04.899
room eight-D.

16:04.900 --> 16:06.466
- It's Nathan's room!

16:06.467 --> 16:07.899
- I wanna be the one who
gets to knock on the door!

16:07.900 --> 16:10.099
I get to knock!

16:10.100 --> 16:12.766
- Okay, geez!
- All right!

16:12.767 --> 16:14.400
- Okay.

16:16.700 --> 16:18.132
- Ah!
The door's opening!

16:18.133 --> 16:19.653
- Oh, we're about
to meet Nathan Kre...

16:25.100 --> 16:27.200
- Hey.
- Hudson?!?

16:29.067 --> 16:31.232
- H-How'd you get in there?!?

16:31.233 --> 16:33.433
- They gave us a key.
Remember?

16:34.867 --> 16:37.066
Well, c'mon in.

16:37.067 --> 16:39.267
- Uh, I mean...

16:41.367 --> 16:44.199
Hey! Hey!

16:44.200 --> 16:46.066
If you keep making that noise,

16:46.067 --> 16:47.332
grown ups are gonna
make you take medication.

16:47.333 --> 16:51.332
- But this is the hotel room
of Nathan Kress, from iCarly.

16:51.333 --> 16:53.332
- I know!
Is he in here?

16:53.333 --> 16:55.132
- No, but he's not
far from here.

16:55.133 --> 16:56.366
- How do you know?

16:56.367 --> 16:59.399
- His pizza...
it's still warm.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.932
- Okay. It's not right to poke
a celebrity's pizza

17:00.933 --> 17:02.433
with your finger!

17:03.200 --> 17:04.633
- Heeheeheeheehee.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.332
Hey Dad.

17:08.333 --> 17:11.499
- Triple G! Hey!
Guess where I am!

17:11.500 --> 17:13.366
Sounds like you're
in your helicopter.

17:13.367 --> 17:16.066
- That's right,
and guess where I'm headed.

17:16.067 --> 17:17.599
- I don't know, Dad.

17:17.600 --> 17:20.932
- To Freddie Benson's
hotel room!

17:20.933 --> 17:22.066
- No!
Tell him not to come here!

17:22.067 --> 17:22.967
Dub, don't come here.

17:22.968 --> 17:26.400
- Hey! Click!

17:28.200 --> 17:29.466
- I hate it when he says click!

17:29.467 --> 17:32.066
- Ah!!!
- What?!? What happened?

17:32.067 --> 17:35.066
- Look! Nathan's wallet.

17:35.067 --> 17:38.066
- Ooooo.
- Whooaaa.

17:38.067 --> 17:39.232
- Dare I look inside?

17:39.233 --> 17:40.632
- Yeah man!
- Sure, do it!

17:40.633 --> 17:41.866
- Wait, hey, we have to
respect his privacy.

17:41.867 --> 17:44.166
I mean, if we just start
looking through his wallet,

17:44.167 --> 17:49.066
we might find his
Platinum United Express card.

17:49.067 --> 17:51.066
- Ooooo.
- Fancy.

17:51.067 --> 17:52.299
- All right, all right,
all right,

17:52.300 --> 17:54.699
let's see what he's really got.

17:54.700 --> 17:57.966
- Ahh there it is!
- Mmm-hmm yeah, here we go.

17:57.967 --> 17:59.566
- Count it!
- All right. Let's see,

17:59.567 --> 18:02.299
he's got twenty...
forty... sixty...

18:02.300 --> 18:04.166
eighty...
a hundred...

18:04.167 --> 18:05.399
- Ooo...
- Ooo! Two hundred...

18:05.400 --> 18:08.232
Now see, this is probably
some a'that iCarly money...

18:08.233 --> 18:10.667
- Oh yeah.
- TV money.

18:11.300 --> 18:15.066
- Awww, hey look, here's
a pic of Nathan and a dog.

18:15.067 --> 18:16.899
- Aw cute.
I wonder what his name is.

18:16.900 --> 18:18.499
- Security.

18:18.500 --> 18:21.066
- Noooo. Who would name
a dog "Security?"

18:36.133 --> 18:38.566
- Hiiii.
- Hello.

18:38.567 --> 18:40.233
- What's up?
- You're Freddie.

18:42.067 --> 18:44.166
- Uh yeah, I just found some...

18:44.167 --> 18:46.466
- No no no!
- Please Please Please!

18:46.467 --> 18:49.532
- Um, I think I'm okay.

18:49.533 --> 18:52.767
- But I might call back.

18:53.067 --> 18:56.366
So...

18:56.367 --> 18:57.932
- Okay...
here's the deal...

18:57.933 --> 19:00.199
we're like...
big fans...

19:00.200 --> 19:01.167
- Oh yes.
- Very large fans.

19:01.168 --> 19:02.666
- Thank you.

19:02.667 --> 19:04.299
- And we read online
that you're always

19:04.300 --> 19:06.099
super nice to your fans.

19:06.100 --> 19:07.932
- Yep. Yeah.

19:07.933 --> 19:10.399
Especially fans that don't
break into my hotel room,

19:10.400 --> 19:12.533
look through my wallet...

19:14.167 --> 19:17.899
and... ulch.

19:17.900 --> 19:20.099
Did one of you guys
stick your finger in my pizza?

19:20.100 --> 19:23.066
Repeatedly?

19:23.067 --> 19:26.166
- Okay, look, I'm sure you
probably just want us to leave.

19:26.167 --> 19:28.499
- Eh...
you are not wrong.

19:28.500 --> 19:31.466
- Umm...
But before we go...

19:31.467 --> 19:32.200
- We just have one, majorly
important question

19:32.201 --> 19:34.599
that we need to ask you.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.399
- I don't know what
happened to Carly's mom.

19:36.400 --> 19:37.599
- Oh uh, no, it's not that.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.099
- I do know what the goat did.
But I can't tell ya.

19:40.100 --> 19:41.466
- No no no.
- It's not that.

19:41.467 --> 19:43.632
- Okay.
Then...?

19:43.633 --> 19:45.132
- Who was Freddie in love with?

19:45.133 --> 19:46.399
- Was it Carly?
- Or was it Sam?

19:46.400 --> 19:47.832
Please say it was Sam
and shut her up.

19:47.833 --> 19:50.232
- Just tell us who
you were in love with,

19:50.233 --> 19:53.499
Carly or Sam.
- Or Gibby.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.599
- Just tell us!
It was Carly, right?

19:55.600 --> 19:57.232
- No, you love Sam!
Say you love Sam!

19:57.233 --> 19:58.399
- All right. Listen...

19:58.400 --> 20:00.666
- Yeah?!?
- What?!?

20:00.667 --> 20:03.499
- Look, I am
just an actor. Okay?

20:03.500 --> 20:06.932
I am not one of the geniuses
who wrote iCarly.

20:06.933 --> 20:10.632
And, since it was never
established on the show,

20:10.633 --> 20:12.266
I don't know which girl
Freddie loved more.

20:12.267 --> 20:15.499
- Okay. Then... then
just tell us your opinion.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.599
- Mhm.
- Yeah. Tell us.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.132
- If you could decide
if Freddie was in love

20:18.133 --> 20:22.099
with Carly or Sam,
who would you pick?

20:22.100 --> 20:23.632
- Well...

20:23.633 --> 20:25.199
Look, I'm not really
supposed to say...

20:25.200 --> 20:26.299
- But?!? But?!?
- Just tell us!

20:26.300 --> 20:28.266
- All right.
All right.

20:28.267 --> 20:30.132
In my opinion...
- Say it.

20:30.133 --> 20:31.599
- I feel that Freddie...

20:31.600 --> 20:34.199
if he had to choose
Carly or Sam...

20:34.200 --> 20:35.933
would definitely pick...
- Y'ahhhhh!!!

20:37.933 --> 20:39.032
Oh! I'm okay!

20:39.033 --> 20:41.499
- Who is...
Is that Double G?!?

20:41.500 --> 20:44.466
- It is!
- Yep! Double G.

20:44.467 --> 20:46.566
