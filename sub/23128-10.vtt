WEBVTT

00:02.029 --> 00:03.998
- Previously on Being Human.
- Aaah!

00:04.170 --> 00:07.731
So what? You drank
from Josh and got immunized?

00:07.770 --> 00:09.659
- There's a vaccine
for the virus.

00:09.710 --> 00:12.975
Werewolf blood. But Josh
and Nora are off-limits.

00:13.010 --> 00:14.671
(Growling)

00:14.710 --> 00:16.200
- Aaah!

00:16.250 --> 00:18.309
I got scratched by Liam.

00:18.350 --> 00:20.546
On the next full moon,
I'm gonna be a wolf.

00:21.550 --> 00:22.847
- This is Pete.

00:22.890 --> 00:24.346
- Ah! Hi, there!

00:24.390 --> 00:26.654
Took me a long time to
find peace with my wolf.

00:26.690 --> 00:29.011
Have you guys ever
tried meditation?

00:29.060 --> 00:32.655
That's where I first met him.

00:32.700 --> 00:33.895
- Ah!

00:33.930 --> 00:37.366
I'm decomposing. The price
for hanging on is too high.

00:37.400 --> 00:41.337
How long till I need something
more substantial than a mouse?

00:41.370 --> 00:43.509
- Nick?

00:43.540 --> 00:45.406
What's wrong
with you? Aaah!

00:47.210 --> 00:49.076
(Birds chirping)

01:00.660 --> 01:02.424
- Hello?

01:02.460 --> 01:05.259
You don't have to be afraid!

01:05.360 --> 01:06.452
Why would he be afraid?

01:06.500 --> 01:08.025
I'm the one who should be...

01:08.060 --> 01:09.221
(Twig snaps)

01:10.830 --> 01:12.434
...afraid.

01:24.180 --> 01:25.170
(Panting)

01:26.250 --> 01:28.878
(Inhales sharply)

01:28.920 --> 01:30.615
Hey there!

01:37.760 --> 01:40.457
I should probably name you, huh?

01:40.500 --> 01:43.026
Listen, we should talk...

01:43.470 --> 01:45.325
or commune...

01:45.370 --> 01:46.792
or whatever.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.433
So--so please don't...

01:48.470 --> 01:50.131
(Growls)

01:51.170 --> 01:52.831
...go.

01:55.840 --> 01:57.444
(Sighing)

01:59.620 --> 02:01.110
Damn.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.987
- That's good, man.

02:05.020 --> 02:06.283
You were in for
over 10 minutes.

02:06.320 --> 02:07.685
How'd it go?

02:07.720 --> 02:11.122
- It was a complete
and abject failure.

02:11.160 --> 02:13.322
I'm naked, wandering around
the forest in my brain

02:13.360 --> 02:14.919
and the stupid
wolf hates me.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.325
Then I pop out of it
to find Obi-Wan the werewolf

02:16.370 --> 02:18.668
offering a hot beverage
and baked goods.

02:21.000 --> 02:29.000
- Do you want a cookie?
- Yes, I do!

02:33.080 --> 02:35.014
(Woman screaming)

02:37.690 --> 02:40.011
(Screaming continues)

02:45.830 --> 02:48.253
(Screaming stops)

03:01.180 --> 03:03.171
(Man vocalizing)

03:08.680 --> 03:09.647
- The child?

03:09.690 --> 03:12.751
- I'm sorry.

03:12.790 --> 03:15.816
But the baby is
with God now.

03:15.860 --> 03:17.851
He was not
strong enough.

03:17.890 --> 03:19.824
- Suzanna?
- Your wife is very weak.

03:19.860 --> 03:22.397
- Suzanna. .
- But she will live.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.496
- Oh, my love.

03:27.540 --> 03:30.532
Sleep now.

03:30.570 --> 03:32.379
I am right here.

03:57.300 --> 03:59.394
(Groans)

04:05.640 --> 04:07.108
(Repetitive thudding)

04:11.410 --> 04:12.775
What are doing up so early?

04:12.820 --> 04:14.242
- I couldn't sleep.

04:14.280 --> 04:16.783
I kept dreaming about
eating in a bad way.

04:16.820 --> 04:19.084
Why are you walking
around with no shoes on?

04:19.120 --> 04:23.079
- Um, I--I'm not sure.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.222
- Were you
sleepwalking?

04:24.260 --> 04:25.227
- I don't sleepwalk.

04:25.260 --> 04:26.898
- But you were on
the streets in bare feet.

04:26.930 --> 04:28.227
(Stammers)

04:28.260 --> 04:29.398
Also, you stink.

04:29.430 --> 04:32.968
- Well, I was
in some garbage.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.867
- Oh! Bender much?

04:35.900 --> 04:40.133
- I was not on a bender!
I had one bag of blood. One.

04:40.180 --> 04:41.807
And then I read a book
and then I went to bed.

04:41.840 --> 04:42.944
(Sighing)

04:42.980 --> 04:44.778
- I have a theory.

04:45.850 --> 04:48.740
I think you're
backed up.

04:48.780 --> 04:49.588
- What do you mean backed up?

04:49.620 --> 04:50.644
- Sexually.

04:51.950 --> 04:53.258
When was
the last time

04:53.290 --> 04:56.009
you broke off
a piece for yourself?

04:56.060 --> 04:57.084
More than a year.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.950
And Kat comes along,

04:58.990 --> 05:00.594
and you guys flirt,

05:00.630 --> 05:03.520
she makes you soup when
you had vampire-death flu,

05:05.500 --> 05:07.332
and you wanna
get on that.

05:07.370 --> 05:08.667
(Stammers)

05:08.700 --> 05:10.134
But you can't.

05:10.170 --> 05:12.673
You're a gentleman,
so you're holding off.

05:14.140 --> 05:16.780
But that doesn't stop
your subconscious mind.

05:16.810 --> 05:18.278
Mm-hmm.

05:18.310 --> 05:20.779
You go to sleep
and it takes over,

05:20.820 --> 05:23.141
sending you out
into the world,

05:23.190 --> 05:25.249
just looking
for some ass.

05:26.320 --> 05:29.483
I was a psych major
for a semester.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.500
- Oh my God.
I'm not backed up.

05:32.530 --> 05:34.328
- Oh, so you and
Kat have, uh...

05:34.360 --> 05:36.499
- No!

05:36.530 --> 05:38.828
No, not that it's any
of your business.

05:38.870 --> 05:41.293
(Sighing)

05:41.340 --> 05:42.410
We're not there yet.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.363
- Where are you?
Over the bra? Under the bra?

05:44.410 --> 05:46.208
- We're going on a 2nd date.
- Where?

05:46.240 --> 05:48.675
- I don't know. She wants
to keep it a surprise.

05:49.710 --> 05:51.178
Don't.

05:51.210 --> 05:52.848
(Sighing)

05:52.880 --> 05:56.510
Look, I actually think
it's pretty nice.

05:56.550 --> 05:58.188
I mean, I like
surprises...

05:58.220 --> 05:59.142
(Inhales, moans)

05:59.190 --> 06:00.282
...kind of like
normal-people surprises.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.982
I can see you're not gonna stop.
I'm gonna take a shower.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.351
- Yeah, showers.
Cold showers.

06:05.390 --> 06:08.519
- OK, listen to me! You are one
of the only people I know

06:08.560 --> 06:10.164
who is less weird as a ghost

06:10.200 --> 06:12.066
than you are as a person.

06:12.100 --> 06:13.067
Just saying.

06:13.100 --> 06:16.502
(Telephone ringing)

06:16.540 --> 06:18.008
- Hello?

06:18.040 --> 06:20.577
Zoe? Wait, what?

06:24.510 --> 06:27.411
Oh my God!

06:27.450 --> 06:29.919
That's Nick?

06:29.950 --> 06:32.214
- I don't know
what to do!

06:43.800 --> 06:45.723
(Birds chirping)

06:45.770 --> 06:49.263
- Yeah, I'm just not
sure this is me, you know?

06:49.300 --> 06:53.737
Meditating, searching
for my inner insides.

06:53.780 --> 06:57.375
I was never much of a "be the
ball" kind of guy, you know?

06:57.410 --> 06:59.071
- So what is it, Josh?

06:59.110 --> 07:00.771
Is it self-loathing?

07:00.820 --> 07:03.846
Is it the constant fear
of hurting strangers?

07:04.920 --> 07:06.479
(Squirrel chattering)

07:06.520 --> 07:09.581
- For years, all I wanted
was to be rid of the wolf.

07:09.630 --> 07:12.622
And then, when that
finally came true,

07:12.660 --> 07:15.925
all it did was shine
a light on the fact

07:15.960 --> 07:18.429
that I'm still in this world.

07:18.470 --> 07:20.689
The friends I have, Nora...

07:23.440 --> 07:27.070
I will always be stuck
in this world.

07:27.110 --> 07:31.570
And I just have to figure out
a way to live in it.

07:31.610 --> 07:34.409
- How long you been
fighting with your wolf?

07:34.450 --> 07:36.680
- Five years.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.939
- And how long have
you spent meditating?

07:41.820 --> 07:43.288
- Two days.

07:43.330 --> 07:44.786
- Two days.

07:44.830 --> 07:46.753
- Ah, you're right.
I know, you're right.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.154
- Tell you what.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.089
You bring a 6-pack tonight,

07:50.130 --> 07:52.326
and we'll nail
this thing down.

07:52.370 --> 07:55.294
No stopping until
you get some face time

07:55.340 --> 07:57.160
with your furrier side.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.176
- And then he came at me,
so I grabbed the bat,

08:03.210 --> 08:05.008
but he just
wouldn't stop coming!

08:05.050 --> 08:06.973
- It's OK. You were
protecting yourself.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.818
- You would
never hurt me!

08:08.850 --> 08:10.249
- Yes. Yes,
I would have.

08:11.550 --> 08:13.655
And so will Sally,
eventually.

08:13.690 --> 08:15.988
- That's not true!
It's not true!

08:16.020 --> 08:18.330
- You know what
the hunger is, Sally.

08:18.360 --> 08:19.691
It's only
a matter of time.

08:19.730 --> 08:21.459
I'm not saying this
because I'm angry.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.821
I'm not trying to
blame you for anything.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.520
I'm just worried
about her.

08:27.540 --> 08:30.601
- We have to do something.

08:30.640 --> 08:31.869
You got him back once.

08:31.910 --> 08:34.174
Maybe this time he could be
like he was before.

08:34.210 --> 08:37.009
- Sally can't do anything.

08:37.049 --> 08:40.816
And neither
can you.

08:40.850 --> 08:41.874
(Gasps)

08:43.350 --> 08:44.681
See?

08:44.720 --> 08:46.916
It's not an entirely
unhappy ending.

08:48.220 --> 08:50.359
I get my door.

08:50.390 --> 08:53.052
I guess I served
my purpose

08:53.100 --> 08:55.296
by warning you.

08:57.570 --> 08:59.527
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

08:59.570 --> 09:02.665
- God, I'm--I'm sorry.
- Do not be sorry.

09:02.710 --> 09:06.362
I am so grateful for this
time that we had together.

09:06.410 --> 09:08.037
I'm the one
who's sorry.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.401
You have to deal
with all this.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.561
And stay away from Sally.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.364
She will kill you,

09:37.410 --> 09:39.731
even if she doesn't
think she will.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.581
- Zoe, is there
something I can do?

09:55.620 --> 09:57.281
- Goodbye, Sally.

09:57.330 --> 10:00.254
- Please don't do this.
Please don't cut me off.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.565
You know how hard I tried
to make everything work.

10:03.600 --> 10:07.366
- I know, but I don't want
to have to do this again.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.765
You have to stay
away from me.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.777
- What about Nick?

10:21.820 --> 10:24.983
His body. What are
you gonna do about that?

10:31.830 --> 10:33.798
Josh, I'm sorry to
call you in on this.

10:33.830 --> 10:35.821
- No, it's all right.

10:35.860 --> 10:37.419
- I didn't know
what else to do.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.494
- Is Zoe OK?

10:38.530 --> 10:40.498
- Um, no, she's, uh...

10:40.540 --> 10:42.804
I'd say she's pretty
far from that.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.808
- Yeah.

10:44.840 --> 10:47.104
- Is Nick gonna
be safe here?

10:47.140 --> 10:48.801
- Yeah, I mean, this should do.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.103
There's no foot traffic,

10:50.150 --> 10:51.470
and this hole's
deep enough

10:51.510 --> 10:53.842
that the animals
should leave him alone.

10:54.850 --> 10:56.477
Oh my God!

10:56.520 --> 10:57.942
- Are you OK?

10:57.990 --> 11:00.152
- I can't believe how
unremarkable it's become

11:00.190 --> 11:01.157
to dispose of a body.

11:01.190 --> 11:02.510
- I'll finish.
I got It.

11:02.560 --> 11:03.527
- No, I got it.

11:03.560 --> 11:05.483
Can you do me a favour

11:05.530 --> 11:07.055
and bring me up
to speed here?

11:07.100 --> 11:08.329
So Nick was
killed by Zoe

11:08.360 --> 11:10.499
because his
reanimated corpse

11:10.530 --> 11:13.966
developed a
craving for flesh,

11:14.000 --> 11:17.800
for human flesh,
like a zombie.

11:17.840 --> 11:18.807
- Yeah.

11:18.840 --> 11:20.501
- But you don't have

11:20.540 --> 11:22.372
the same zombie-like
appetite, right?

11:22.410 --> 11:23.969
- No.
- Well, that's something.

11:24.010 --> 11:26.001
- Not really.

11:26.050 --> 11:27.870
Not yet.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.040
I may be
a flesh-eater.

11:32.090 --> 11:33.558
- You may be.

11:35.020 --> 11:37.352
Well, have you or
have you not eaten flesh?

11:37.390 --> 11:38.858
- I've eaten small things.

11:38.890 --> 11:40.198
Mice.

11:40.230 --> 11:41.425
- Mice.

11:41.460 --> 11:43.189
- Yeah, but
I quit cold turkey.

11:43.230 --> 11:44.994
It made the hunger worse.

11:45.030 --> 11:47.863
Once I ate the mouse, it just
made me want to eat more things.

11:47.900 --> 11:49.163
(Groans)

11:49.200 --> 11:51.134
Like, bigger things.

11:53.140 --> 11:56.371
OK, well, we'll just go home
and we'll noodle this through.

11:56.410 --> 11:57.571
We'll get Aidan on board.

11:57.610 --> 12:00.341
- Oh, Aidan knows.

12:00.380 --> 12:03.918
Josh, I didn't want to dump
more stuff on you. I'm sorry.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.217
- OK.

12:06.250 --> 12:07.957
(Panting)

12:07.990 --> 12:10.925
Well, now that we know what
we're dealing with, we can--

12:10.960 --> 12:12.928
We can deal with
it more, right?

12:12.960 --> 12:14.428
(Grunts)

12:14.460 --> 12:18.226
- Oh no.
- What?

12:18.270 --> 12:19.692
"Oh no" what?

12:19.730 --> 12:21.232
- Stevie?
He doesn't know.

12:21.270 --> 12:24.069
What if he has the same
thing Nick and I have?

12:24.110 --> 12:26.932
He's out there somewhere
wandering around.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.709
He's completely clueless!

12:28.740 --> 12:30.777
And hungry.

12:38.420 --> 12:40.081
(Horse snorts)

12:40.120 --> 12:43.624
- The Bible assures we will face
the judgement of the Lord,

12:44.630 --> 12:48.157
- when we enter
his kingdom in heaven.

12:48.600 --> 12:52.696
But what of now,
here, in Corwich?

12:54.040 --> 12:57.999
Surely we witness God's
judicious hand in our lives.

12:59.270 --> 13:02.672
If he finds us unworthy,
he may take from us --

13:02.710 --> 13:08.069
our crops, our homes,
our family.

13:08.120 --> 13:11.613
We are all aware that 2 young
members of our family

13:11.650 --> 13:14.449
have been trying to start
a brood of their own.

13:14.490 --> 13:16.151
Once again...

13:17.730 --> 13:21.052
they have lost the
precious little life.

13:22.830 --> 13:25.629
This is tragic, yes.

13:25.670 --> 13:30.005
But it allows us to show that
we deserve a place with God.

13:30.040 --> 13:33.135
And we do this by
opening our hearts

13:33.180 --> 13:34.932
and by prayer.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.971
Let us bow our heads.

13:37.010 --> 13:39.342
Lord, we call upon you

13:39.380 --> 13:43.442
in the service of
Aidan and Suzanna Waite,

13:43.490 --> 13:45.310
so that one day,

13:45.350 --> 13:49.958
you may find their souls worthy
enough to show them your grace

13:49.990 --> 13:53.824
and grant them
the gift of a child.

13:57.870 --> 13:59.190
(Bell tolling)

14:07.180 --> 14:09.000
- They pity us
for our tragedy.

14:09.040 --> 14:12.806
- They pity us because that
jackanape dragged our tragedy

14:12.850 --> 14:14.170
up and down his aisles.

14:14.220 --> 14:15.710
- Aidan Waite,

14:15.750 --> 14:18.048
do not sling words
like that toward a reverend.

14:18.090 --> 14:21.412
- What should I
call him then? An ass?

14:21.460 --> 14:24.521
That is what he is,
a jealous ass.

14:24.560 --> 14:27.860
Herring had his eye on you
the moment he came to town.

14:27.900 --> 14:29.390
The man has
had it in for me

14:29.430 --> 14:31.865
since the day I put
a ring on your finger.

14:31.900 --> 14:33.436
- You should
mind your pride.

14:33.470 --> 14:35.666
- Ha! Why? Because God
will look on that

14:35.700 --> 14:38.203
and find me more unworthy
than he already has,

14:38.240 --> 14:40.402
according to Herring?

14:40.440 --> 14:42.875
You cannot believe
what Herring said.

14:42.910 --> 14:46.540
God would not want
our child dead.

14:49.420 --> 14:51.184
- We tried so hard.

14:51.220 --> 14:53.655
- Shhh... And we
shall keep trying.

14:55.260 --> 14:59.424
But please, do not
expect me to sit still

14:59.460 --> 15:04.091
while that man uses his sermons
to rub salt on our wounds.

15:15.340 --> 15:17.069
- So, what do you think?

15:17.110 --> 15:19.875
I present to you Boston's
rare book archive.

15:19.910 --> 15:20.980
- Sweet!

15:21.020 --> 15:22.749
- It's nice to be here
with a civilian

15:22.780 --> 15:25.579
who enjoys the smell
of dried binding glue.

15:25.620 --> 15:28.612
- Oh yeah, well, don't forget
the, uh, whisper of mold.

15:28.660 --> 15:29.912
(Giggling)

15:29.960 --> 15:31.758
- What's with
the backpack?

15:31.790 --> 15:35.249
- Oh, I carry food around.
It's like a blood-sugar thing.

15:35.300 --> 15:38.099
- Oh, does that mean you have
sandwiches and Twinkies?

15:38.130 --> 15:39.564
- Uh, well,
no, not anymore.

15:39.600 --> 15:40.931
I already ate.

15:40.970 --> 15:43.132
- Well, T still
appreciate you embracing

15:43.170 --> 15:45.332
the whole scholarly,
field-trip vibe.

15:45.370 --> 15:48.305
- I see. So, this is
gonna be our thing now, huh?

15:48.340 --> 15:52.447
Lunch boxes and
history and old stuff?

15:52.480 --> 15:54.278
Because I'm
cool with that.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.641
I mean, look, I've been working
on this Lewis and Clark riff

15:56.680 --> 15:57.841
a long time.

15:57.890 --> 15:59.915
I've been dying
to try it out.

15:59.950 --> 16:03.682
- This excursion isn't about
history or some old books.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.824
It's about one book.
Singular.

16:06.830 --> 16:08.821
- OK.

16:09.830 --> 16:11.924
Wait, hold on
for a second.

16:11.970 --> 16:14.462
Are you--are you
allowed to do that,

16:14.500 --> 16:16.298
just, like, pull
stuff off the shelves?

16:16.340 --> 16:18.331
- Yeah, it's cool.
I roll deep here.

16:18.370 --> 16:20.338
- Days on the Charles.

16:20.380 --> 16:21.836
- You're smiling.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.473
- Well, yeah,
this is neat.

16:23.510 --> 16:25.478
- Yeah, you're smiling
just to be nice.

16:25.510 --> 16:27.046
And you're thinking:

16:27.080 --> 16:29.617
"Why is this chick handing
me this random-ass book?"

16:29.650 --> 16:33.484
- No, that's--that's spot on,
actually. That's exactly it.

16:33.520 --> 16:34.783
Uh, Corwich,
Massachusetts.

16:34.820 --> 16:39.155
Printed by...
Edmund Waite.

16:39.190 --> 16:41.500
- You mumble-spewed
something about Corwich

16:41.530 --> 16:42.497
when you were sick,

16:42.530 --> 16:44.464
and I remembered this book

16:44.500 --> 16:47.333
from this exhibition
on local printings.

16:47.370 --> 16:49.691
I assume this guy
is some relation?

16:49.740 --> 16:53.176
- Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, we are related.

16:53.210 --> 16:54.371
Uh, he is...

16:55.540 --> 16:56.905
He's my father...

16:56.940 --> 17:00.717
father's great-great-
great grandfather.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.309
- Seriously?

17:02.350 --> 17:03.317
- Yeah.

17:03.350 --> 17:04.545
- Crap!

17:04.589 --> 17:06.012
- What? Is there
something--

17:06.050 --> 17:07.518
I shouldn't be
holding this?

17:07.560 --> 17:08.516
- No. Jeff.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.516
- Jeff?

17:09.560 --> 17:11.324
- My ex is here.

17:11.359 --> 17:15.354
The guy and the jacket patches
and young thing on his arm.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.700
Yeah, I know.
He was my professor.

17:18.730 --> 17:20.095
- Not judging.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.336
- No, judge away.
Younger women are his M.O.

17:22.369 --> 17:24.759
Do you mind
if we hide?

17:24.810 --> 17:26.368
- No, I don't mind,
but he might.

17:26.410 --> 17:28.230
O Kat?
Aw, crap!

17:28.280 --> 17:29.577
- Oh! Is
that you?

17:29.610 --> 17:30.748
(Chuckling
nervously)

17:30.780 --> 17:31.906
- Hey.

17:32.910 --> 17:34.912
(Dog barking)

17:42.090 --> 17:45.082
- This is Stevie's
old house.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.228
OK, what exactly
is the plan here?

17:51.270 --> 17:53.398
We're just gonna walk
up to the door, knock,

17:53.440 --> 17:54.760
- tell these
innocent people,

17:54.800 --> 17:56.598
who I would guess
are forever scarred

17:56.640 --> 17:58.062
by the suicide
of their child

17:58.110 --> 17:59.737
that he is now
a reanimated corpse

17:59.770 --> 18:02.034
and has an undeniable
craving for human flesh.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.445
Is that what
we're gonna do?

18:04.580 --> 18:06.901
- Well, yeah. That's
pretty much what I got.

18:06.950 --> 18:09.612
It'll be quick
and painful.

18:09.650 --> 18:11.118
- Like a drive-by.

18:12.120 --> 18:13.781
(Knocking)

18:13.820 --> 18:16.084
- Here we go.

18:16.120 --> 18:18.430
You're crying.
Why are you crying?

18:18.460 --> 18:19.928
- Because when
we tell his mom,

18:19.960 --> 18:22.122
then she's gonna cry
and she's gonna hate us.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.924
And then I'm gonna
Cry anyways, so...

18:23.970 --> 18:25.267
I'm emotional
right now!

18:25.300 --> 18:27.462
- Just let me do the talking.
- OK.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.434
This is bad,
this is bad, this is bad.

18:29.470 --> 18:31.461
- It's all right.

18:34.980 --> 18:37.403
- Stevie?

18:37.450 --> 18:41.114
You look good.
Josh, he looks good.

18:41.150 --> 18:43.539
- What are you
doing here?

18:43.590 --> 18:51.590
- Come in.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.798
- It is so good
to see you.

18:57.830 --> 18:58.797
- Hmm!

18:58.830 --> 19:00.127
- How have you been?

19:00.170 --> 19:01.296
- Same old, same old.

19:01.340 --> 19:03.638
You know,
still at B.C.

19:03.670 --> 19:06.662
- Kat's an adjunct in history.
- That's great.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.804
- Marissa's gonna be
doing an MA in English.

19:08.840 --> 19:11.104
- Which means he keeps
bugging me to get my MA.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.313
I keep trying to get it
through his head that I'm taking

19:14.350 --> 19:16.273
a year break
before my brain explodes.

19:16.320 --> 19:18.015
- Hello.
I'm Aidan Waite.

19:18.050 --> 19:21.179
- Oh, right! Sorry. Jeff Westin.
It's nice to meet you, man.

19:21.220 --> 19:22.949
- And you're Marissa?
- Yeah, hi.

19:22.990 --> 19:25.459
- And you graduated last year.
- That's right.

19:25.490 --> 19:27.959
- So you're here
to see the atlases?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.650
- How'd you know?

19:29.700 --> 19:31.020
- Lucky guess.

19:31.070 --> 19:32.299
(Kat chuckling)

19:32.330 --> 19:33.832
- What say we
continue the tour?

19:33.870 --> 19:36.134
- We should
continue the tour.

19:36.170 --> 19:37.399
- Yeah.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.306
- Nice to meet you,
Marissa. Jeff.

19:39.340 --> 19:41.570
- I'm so happy for you guys!
That's great.

19:41.610 --> 19:44.671
Anyway, man, you just--
You take care of her, all right?

19:44.710 --> 19:46.371
- Oh, I do, Jeff.

19:46.410 --> 19:47.411
Yeah, I do.

19:52.020 --> 19:55.354
Look, hey, I'm sorry about
the "take care of you" thing.

19:55.390 --> 19:57.757
It's just that he's a little
bit condescending, huh?

19:57.790 --> 20:00.259
- No, it's OK. I just
didn't have it in me

20:00.300 --> 20:01.654
to take a swipe at him.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.862
- Do you--do you need
to call it a day?

20:03.900 --> 20:05.664
We can hang out
some other time.

20:05.700 --> 20:07.259
- No, no.
I'm good. I'm good.

20:07.300 --> 20:10.065
I just need to go
some place that serves alcohol.

20:13.040 --> 20:16.533
- I made it to Memphis
before I ran out of money.

20:16.580 --> 20:18.002
I tried looking
for a job,

20:18.050 --> 20:19.370
but it's kind of hard

20:19.410 --> 20:21.048
to negotiate under
the table for money

20:21.080 --> 20:22.718
when you look
like a 16-year-old.

20:22.750 --> 20:24.388
I tried living
on the street.

20:24.420 --> 20:26.718
Didn't take too long
until I got scared.

20:27.720 --> 20:30.052
Then I remembered
the lake house.

20:30.090 --> 20:31.353
- Keanu?
- Sandy?

20:31.390 --> 20:33.552
- What?
- Nothing, just go on.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.920
- Continue.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.553
- My parents have
a house on Wilson Lake.

20:36.600 --> 20:39.194
This time every year,
they hang out there for weeks.

20:39.230 --> 20:42.063
So while they're at the
lake, I'm hiding out here.

20:42.100 --> 20:44.410
- That's not safe.
What if they come home?

20:46.170 --> 20:49.105
- They're not--not
coming home.

20:50.110 --> 20:53.410
I mean, my folks
are like clockwork.

20:53.450 --> 20:54.918
I have at least
another week.

20:54.950 --> 20:57.248
- Stevie, you don't
have another week.

20:57.290 --> 21:00.214
You need to come
home with us now.

21:00.250 --> 21:04.323
- Seriously?

21:04.360 --> 21:06.988
- Yeah, Jeff and I
were together for 4 years.

21:07.030 --> 21:09.920
- Four years,
that's serious.

21:09.960 --> 21:13.260
- He has 2 kids from
a previous marriage,

21:13.300 --> 21:15.291
Andy and Belinda.

21:15.340 --> 21:18.662
We'd get them
every other weekend.

21:18.710 --> 21:21.099
It was great, actually.

21:21.140 --> 21:22.801
Jeff and I would lie around

21:22.840 --> 21:25.104
and talk about starting
a family of our own, you know,

21:25.150 --> 21:27.073
getting a house
and all of it.

21:27.110 --> 21:29.249
- I'll bet that
he was just telling you

21:29.280 --> 21:31.749
what you wanted to hear?

21:31.790 --> 21:33.918
- And then when
I finally was like:

21:33.960 --> 21:38.420
"OK, it's time for us
to take the next step,”

21:38.460 --> 21:41.452
it was like
I caught him stealing,

21:41.500 --> 21:43.969
and he told me
that he already had

21:44.000 --> 21:46.526
all the kids
he wanted to have

21:46.570 --> 21:50.029
and that marriage
was overrated.

21:50.070 --> 21:52.664
- What did you do?

21:52.710 --> 21:54.804
- I packed up and
I moved out.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.330
- Sorry.

21:56.380 --> 21:58.599
- No, uh, don't be.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.914
It was a good thing.

22:00.950 --> 22:02.270
You know, I learned
a lot about what I want.

22:02.320 --> 22:03.742
I want a family.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.849
(Woman singing on stereo,
indistinct)

22:05.890 --> 22:07.039
Don't get me wrong.

22:07.090 --> 22:09.013
I can handle being single,

22:09.060 --> 22:10.550
and I love my job.

22:10.590 --> 22:14.652
But yeah, one day,
I want a house full of kids.

22:19.200 --> 22:23.501
This is so not 2nd date
conversation material.

22:23.540 --> 22:26.009
We should be
talking about Thai food

22:26.040 --> 22:29.374
and the sanitization
of The Hunger Games.

22:32.350 --> 22:33.511
- I can't have children.

22:33.550 --> 22:35.211
(Chokes)

22:35.250 --> 22:37.685
I mean, it's not that
I don't like kids. I love kids.

22:37.720 --> 22:39.939
It's just that I can't
produce any of my own.

22:41.790 --> 22:43.884
- I'm so sorry.

22:43.930 --> 22:46.228
- No, no, no.

22:46.260 --> 22:49.355
I've dealt with it.
It's just that, um,

22:49.400 --> 22:52.222
it's just that
I understand, you know,

22:52.270 --> 22:55.695
uh, the frustration of
being denied a family,

22:55.740 --> 22:56.935
the, uh...

22:58.240 --> 23:01.175
the desperation
and the anger

23:01.210 --> 23:03.235
and the blame.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.576
(Chuckles)

23:09.620 --> 23:13.215
I'm really sorry.
This is, uh, the early reveal.

23:13.250 --> 23:14.684
Sorry about it.

23:14.720 --> 23:16.017
You were being so --

23:16.060 --> 23:17.721
- No!
- ...honest with me,

23:17.760 --> 23:19.649
I felt like... I owed it to you.
- It's OK.

23:21.460 --> 23:23.929
(Knocking)

23:26.730 --> 23:28.698
(Chickens clucking)

23:28.740 --> 23:30.765
- Reverend Herring!

23:30.810 --> 23:32.300
- Afternoon!

23:38.810 --> 23:40.710
- What can I do
for you, Reverend?

23:40.750 --> 23:42.912
- You can start
by explaining why

23:42.950 --> 23:45.715
you have not been
in church in 2 months.

23:45.750 --> 23:49.050
- Please take no offense
to my absence, Reverend.

23:49.090 --> 23:54.597
I simply did not want
to sully the souls

23:54.630 --> 23:57.258
of my fellow
parishioners.

23:57.300 --> 24:01.259
- I see my sermon had
an ill effect on you.

24:01.300 --> 24:03.439
- Well, that was
its intent, though,

24:03.470 --> 24:05.108
was it not?

24:05.140 --> 24:09.407
Why else do you use your pulpit
to throw personal barbs?

24:09.440 --> 24:14.173
- Suzanna seems to have taken my
call to pray for her as genuine.

24:14.220 --> 24:17.850
I feel it has fed her soul,
as was intended.

24:17.890 --> 24:20.348
- Everyone knows that women are
the stronger of the sexes.

24:20.390 --> 24:22.358
They rise easier
from an injury.

24:22.390 --> 24:24.927
- If my words
strike you so deep,

24:24.960 --> 24:27.327
perhaps you should look
at the stain on your soul

24:27.360 --> 24:30.398
and learn why
it offends God.

24:30.430 --> 24:33.320
- Even if there was a speck
of truth to your words,

24:33.370 --> 24:37.967
that would mean that
your God is a cruel beast

24:38.010 --> 24:40.672
who would snuff the life of
an infant to spite the parents.

24:40.710 --> 24:42.405
Then I should want nothing
to do with that God!

24:42.440 --> 24:43.305
- Aidan!

24:43.340 --> 24:45.445
- And there it is,

24:45.480 --> 24:47.676
the beast
within the man.

24:47.720 --> 24:49.848
- You should go,
Reverend.

24:49.880 --> 24:53.282
- Very well. I can see now
that it is only one person

24:53.320 --> 24:55.652
who's unworthy in
the eyes of the Lord

24:55.690 --> 24:58.523
and I am thankful that
he will never bring

24:58.560 --> 25:00.722
his sad, dark seed
to fruition.

25:01.730 --> 25:03.994
- Aidan, no! Oh!

25:04.030 --> 25:07.159
Reverend,
I am so sorry!

25:07.200 --> 25:08.429
- Never come back here.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.348
(Rooster crowing)

25:19.380 --> 25:21.849
(Suzanna crying)

25:31.230 --> 25:33.699
(Siren in distance)

25:33.730 --> 25:35.721
- I'm sorry, I just don't think
it's a very good idea.

25:35.760 --> 25:37.626
- Why not?

25:37.670 --> 25:38.865
- Look, you guys
have a full house!

25:38.900 --> 25:42.859
And no offense, but the worse
things happen to you people.

25:42.900 --> 25:46.131
- Do you have any idea
how dangerous you are?

25:46.170 --> 25:48.730
- Why? 'Cause if I
see someone I know,

25:48.780 --> 25:50.509
something bad
can happen to them?

25:50.540 --> 25:52.702
Look, I was practically
invisible when I was alive.

25:52.750 --> 25:55.071
- We're past that now.
Things have changed.

25:56.880 --> 25:59.110
Nick's dead.

25:59.150 --> 26:00.959
- What do you mean?

26:00.990 --> 26:02.583
- Do you see what
happened to my head?

26:02.620 --> 26:04.088
- I was trying
not to be rude.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.428
- Let me tell you
how this happened.

26:08.930 --> 26:09.920
(Sighing)

26:12.700 --> 26:20.403
- Stevie, you're, um,
out of hand soap.

26:20.440 --> 26:22.431
(Sniffing)

26:27.950 --> 26:29.577
(Sniffing)

26:41.200 --> 26:42.520
Stevie!

26:44.470 --> 26:47.770
- There is an arm
in your house!

26:47.800 --> 26:50.804
In the breadbox,
there is an arm!

26:50.840 --> 26:52.330
- Where is
that from?

26:52.370 --> 26:54.077
Who is that
from, Stevie?

26:54.110 --> 26:56.807
- OK, look.
I did go to Memphis.

26:56.840 --> 26:59.275
OK, and I did run
out of money.

26:59.310 --> 27:02.177
And I got scared
and I did come home.

27:03.790 --> 27:06.179
But there's no lake house.

27:07.820 --> 27:08.958
- SO your parents?

27:08.990 --> 27:10.412
- Look, I needed
to see them.

27:10.460 --> 27:12.929
I thought it would
make me feel better!

27:12.960 --> 27:15.793
I knew it would make them
feel better too, and it worked!

27:15.830 --> 27:19.130
My mom cried,
my dad wouldn't let go of me.

27:19.170 --> 27:21.662
I mean, I explained
everything to them.

27:21.700 --> 27:23.589
Limbo, all of it!

27:23.640 --> 27:26.507
And I went to bed
that night in my old room,

27:26.540 --> 27:29.771
thinking everything
in my life had been fixed.

27:29.810 --> 27:33.007
And then I wake up
and find them.

27:33.050 --> 27:34.779
- When did this happen?

27:34.820 --> 27:36.777
- Weeks ago.

27:36.820 --> 27:38.481
I didn't know
what to do!

27:38.520 --> 27:40.318
I put them in
the garage freezer.

27:40.350 --> 27:41.818
- Ugh!

27:41.860 --> 27:43.385
- I knew all
their information.

27:43.420 --> 27:45.650
They haven't changed their
passwords or anything.

27:45.690 --> 27:49.024
- No one's looked for them?
No one's come looking for them?

27:49.060 --> 27:52.496
- The gardener was paid.
The lawn was mowed.

27:52.530 --> 27:55.295
The electricity stayed on!

27:55.340 --> 27:57.468
Then I got hungry.

27:57.500 --> 27:59.707
Look, I just couldn't stop
stuffing my face with food

27:59.740 --> 28:01.378
at every moment
of the day!

28:01.410 --> 28:04.345
Oh, and then I got a sore,
like that one, on my ear,

28:04.380 --> 28:05.802
and I itched it.

28:05.850 --> 28:08.046
I guess I was nervous,
but I couldn't stop,

28:08.080 --> 28:11.345
and then one day,
my ear, it almost fell off,

28:11.390 --> 28:13.347
and I didn't care!

28:13.390 --> 28:16.189
My appetite had changed.

28:17.390 --> 28:19.427
Food wasn't
enough anymore.

28:19.460 --> 28:21.724
And then it kicked in.

28:21.760 --> 28:24.127
I knew what would
make it better.

28:28.870 --> 28:30.907
- So that's your dad?

28:31.940 --> 28:33.339
- No.

28:33.370 --> 28:34.337
(Sighing)

28:34.380 --> 28:37.031
I finished them already.

28:37.080 --> 28:38.445
It's the mailman.

28:40.920 --> 28:44.242
- So you're--you're
saying that you just--

28:44.290 --> 28:47.043
- He's telling
us that he--

28:47.090 --> 28:49.354
That he cannibalized
his parents

28:49.390 --> 28:53.952
and that he killed and ate
a United States postal worker.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.399
- What? I didn't know
what to do!

28:55.430 --> 28:58.070
- Oh my God, Stevie!
- OK, OK! Just--

28:58.100 --> 29:01.263
Stevie, listen to me.
You're coming home with us.

29:01.300 --> 29:02.267
- No, you just
heard Josh!

29:02.300 --> 29:06.032
There's no going
home for me!

29:06.070 --> 29:07.936
Do you guys really
wanna help me?

29:07.980 --> 29:11.575
- Of course we wanna help you!
That's why we're here, Stevie!

29:11.610 --> 29:15.615
- OK, there's one thing
you guys can do for me,

29:21.260 --> 29:23.922
Every morning,
I wake up,

29:23.960 --> 29:27.681
I stand on that chair...

29:27.730 --> 29:31.360
put my head
through that noose.

29:31.400 --> 29:35.394
And I cry
because I'm scared.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.410
- Scared of dying?

29:38.440 --> 29:39.760
- Scared of what
comes after.

29:39.810 --> 29:41.938
I mean, the first time
I killed myself,

29:41.980 --> 29:45.348
I had so much time
to be miserable

29:45.380 --> 29:48.611
and think about
the mistake I'd made.

29:48.650 --> 29:50.675
(Sighing)

29:50.720 --> 29:55.351
When I feel that
rope on my neck...

29:55.390 --> 29:57.654
I remember waiting to die...

29:59.530 --> 30:01.498
and I back out.

30:01.530 --> 30:02.998
(Sighing)

30:03.030 --> 30:06.591
But now that
you guys are here,

30:06.630 --> 30:09.793
it doesn't have
to be like that.

30:09.840 --> 30:10.796
- What are you
talking about?

30:10.840 --> 30:13.332
- I need you guys
to help me end this.

30:14.340 --> 30:16.331
(Scoffs)

30:18.780 --> 30:20.475
- Stevie, you're not
thinking clearly.

30:20.510 --> 30:21.841
- How can you say that?

30:21.880 --> 30:24.781
- You're asking me
to kill you.

30:24.820 --> 30:25.981
Do you understand
how that sounds?

30:26.020 --> 30:27.510
- Yes, it sounds terrible.

30:27.550 --> 30:35.298
That's why I need
you to help me!

30:35.330 --> 30:36.627
- There's a
different way.

30:36.660 --> 30:38.196
- OK, well,
what is it?

30:38.230 --> 30:39.698
- We're working on it.

30:39.730 --> 30:41.835
- Yeah. All right.

30:41.870 --> 30:45.534
So I'll just keep on going,
thinking about my mom and dad,

30:45.570 --> 30:48.039
seeing their faces,
how happy they were,

30:48.080 --> 30:50.208
not knowing what
I've done to them.

30:50.240 --> 30:52.345
- Stevie, that wasn't
your fault!

30:52.380 --> 30:56.146
- She's right, Stevie.
You're not evil, man.

30:56.180 --> 30:58.979
You're a good guy.
You're...

30:59.020 --> 31:00.886
a decent guy.

31:02.890 --> 31:04.221
- You're wrong.

31:04.260 --> 31:05.853
All I am now...

31:07.900 --> 31:08.890
is hungry.

31:10.100 --> 31:12.569
- Stevie, no!
Stevie!

31:13.900 --> 31:15.334
(Panting)

31:15.370 --> 31:18.362
- Can't you see?
I can't wait for a solution!

31:18.410 --> 31:19.707
(Stevie grunting)

31:19.740 --> 31:22.869
I gonna Kill again
at any moment!

31:22.910 --> 31:25.845
- So if you're a danger
then I am too, right?

31:25.880 --> 31:27.871
I should kill myself
along with you.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.480
Is that what you're saying?

31:32.050 --> 31:34.382
- Please, Josh, you know
I'm right. Just help me.

31:39.690 --> 31:44.025
- Sally, leave the room.

31:44.070 --> 31:45.868
- What?

31:45.900 --> 31:48.289
- I have to help him.

31:48.340 --> 31:49.432
- And now you've
lost your mind too?

31:49.470 --> 31:51.700
- No. I think
I figured it out.

31:51.740 --> 31:56.632
I think I figured out how
to survive in this world.

31:56.680 --> 32:00.969
In our world, you have to be
able to make impossible choices,

32:01.020 --> 32:03.580
not run from them.

32:03.620 --> 32:04.781
I told you before.

32:04.820 --> 32:07.915
This is my fault.
I--I'm in this, OK?

32:07.960 --> 32:09.917
I brought you
all back.

32:09.960 --> 32:12.588
And now I have to deal
with the consequences,

32:12.630 --> 32:13.995
and the pain.

32:15.130 --> 32:17.451
Stevie's in too
much pain, Sally.

32:17.500 --> 32:22.392
- This isn't right.
This is not who you are.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.431
- It's exactly
who I am now.

32:29.940 --> 32:37.940
Go.

32:39.990 --> 32:47.990
Go.

32:51.900 --> 32:54.540
(Crickets chirping)

32:56.500 --> 32:59.367
- It's done.

32:59.410 --> 33:01.879
- Is it my turn now?

33:01.910 --> 33:05.005
Let's get this over with
before it gets out of hand.

33:07.410 --> 33:09.879
- Don't.
Don't say that.

33:11.720 --> 33:13.245
Don't even
think like that.

33:16.860 --> 33:18.988
Stevie was too far gone.

33:19.030 --> 33:21.055
You're not like that.

33:21.100 --> 33:24.229
You haven't hurt anyone yet,
and you're not going to.

33:24.270 --> 33:26.068
You're gonna fight.

33:26.100 --> 33:28.330
We're gonna save you.

33:28.370 --> 33:30.190
Do you understand me?

33:30.240 --> 33:31.537
(Whooshing)

33:31.570 --> 33:33.607
- I knew I'd
see you again.

33:37.610 --> 33:39.749
- Stevie, I'm sorry.

33:39.780 --> 33:41.669
- Oh, stop.

33:41.720 --> 33:45.213
Look, you got me
out of limbo.

33:45.250 --> 33:48.959
OK? You gave me
a 2nd chance.

33:49.960 --> 33:51.553
Thank you.

33:53.090 --> 33:54.524
And thank you, too, Josh.

33:54.560 --> 33:56.028
- Is he--is he OK?

33:56.060 --> 33:58.700
- I don't know
if I'll ever be OK,

33:58.730 --> 34:01.461
but at least I'm not hungry,
so there's that.

34:07.070 --> 34:08.400
No way.

34:08.440 --> 34:10.101
- Stevie's gonna be fine.

34:11.780 --> 34:13.873
His door's here.

34:16.420 --> 34:18.114
- What do I do?
Do I just go in?

34:18.150 --> 34:20.312
- That's the general idea.

34:24.090 --> 34:26.627
- Sally, I don't
know what to say.

34:26.659 --> 34:28.549
(Chuckles)

34:28.600 --> 34:30.728
I think you might be
my best friend,

34:30.760 --> 34:32.420
for what that's worth.

34:34.639 --> 34:36.768
- It's worth a lot.

34:36.800 --> 34:38.563
(Sighing)

34:40.670 --> 34:43.275
- Thanks again.

34:43.310 --> 34:44.641
- Now go.

34:44.750 --> 34:45.649
(Sighing)

34:46.480 --> 34:48.949
These things tend
to be impatient.

35:04.530 --> 35:06.259
- Stevie, wait!

35:13.370 --> 35:14.974
- Is something wrong?

35:15.010 --> 35:17.001
- Yeah, something
IS very wrong.

35:18.850 --> 35:20.648
(Car honking)

35:20.680 --> 35:23.149
- I had a million
scenarios in my head

35:23.180 --> 35:24.818
how this date
would fall apart

35:24.850 --> 35:26.340
and this wasn't
one of them.

35:26.390 --> 35:29.951
- Yeah, it didn't
exactly go to plan.

35:29.990 --> 35:33.824
- Uh, maybe next time
we can talk about an ex

35:33.860 --> 35:35.828
who hurt you the most.

35:35.860 --> 35:37.419
- Next time?

35:37.460 --> 35:40.691
- Yeah, what, you don't want
there to be a next time?

35:40.730 --> 35:43.165
- Um... ah! Nothing
would make me happier.

35:43.200 --> 35:45.510
It's just that
I understand how you feel

35:45.540 --> 35:47.907
and I don't really
wanna waste your time.

35:50.540 --> 35:53.703
- You're not
a waste of time.

35:53.750 --> 35:56.378
I'm the one who shared
too much tonight.

35:56.420 --> 35:59.344
You opened up and
made me feel better.

35:59.390 --> 36:00.949
That's not easy.

36:00.990 --> 36:03.311
- I just don't
wanna play games.

36:03.360 --> 36:05.226
- Neither do 1.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.329
- Um, you know what?

36:19.370 --> 36:21.031
Hmm! I was just
thinking that

36:21.070 --> 36:24.370
we're just, like,
both a little bit too raw

36:24.410 --> 36:26.276
for this to
be a good idea.

36:27.250 --> 36:28.979
- No. Yeah.
You're right.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.419
- Mm-hmm.

36:30.450 --> 36:31.485
(Clears throat)

36:31.520 --> 36:32.510
- See you later.

36:32.550 --> 36:34.552
- You can count on it.

36:37.420 --> 36:41.425
* Swallowed whole

36:43.100 --> 36:45.068
* By the devil's

36:48.100 --> 36:49.738
(Sighing)

36:49.770 --> 36:50.760
* Eyes

36:52.070 --> 36:54.061
(Siren wailing in distance)

36:56.280 --> 37:01.309
* All

37:02.320 --> 37:05.449
* Is not

37:06.820 --> 37:10.757
* Lost... *

37:12.130 --> 37:13.928
(Knocking)

37:21.570 --> 37:29.570
- I don't care if
it's a bad idea.

37:31.610 --> 37:39.610
- I don't care if
it's a bad idea.

37:43.260 --> 37:44.250
- What are you doing?

37:44.290 --> 37:46.088
- Getting rid of
my fingerprints.

37:46.130 --> 37:47.825
I never thought
I'd have to say that.

37:47.860 --> 37:50.090
Never thought
I'd be doing this.

37:50.130 --> 37:51.620
(Sighing)

37:51.670 --> 37:56.562
So ghost doors
are never the same?

37:56.600 --> 37:58.910
- Never.

37:58.940 --> 38:01.637
Everyone's door
is their door.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.843
- Let's add that to the list of
things we need to figure out.

38:06.850 --> 38:08.318
- My clock's ticking.

38:08.350 --> 38:09.818
<i>- I know.</i>

38:09.850 --> 38:12.512
If you're gonna go
through the same door,

38:12.550 --> 38:15.110
we need to figure out
what's on the other of it.

38:15.160 --> 38:18.152
- That's not what
I'm talking about.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.627
(Sighing)

38:23.660 --> 38:25.662
That arm in there...

38:27.700 --> 38:29.794
I wanna eat that.

38:30.900 --> 38:34.632
I don't know how much time
I have left, Josh,

38:34.680 --> 38:37.877
but I'm afraid you're all
in trouble with me around.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.819
(Grunting)

38:48.220 --> 38:49.813
(Choking)

38:54.260 --> 38:55.398
- What's up with Dave?

38:55.430 --> 38:56.659
- That's what's
supposed to happen.

38:56.700 --> 38:58.225
That's how you know
it's working.

38:59.400 --> 39:01.732
- I'm next.

39:01.770 --> 39:04.831
- Pete!
Sorry I'm late.

39:04.870 --> 39:06.702
I had a breakthrough.

39:06.740 --> 39:09.471
A horrible,
tragic breakthrough.

39:09.510 --> 39:11.069
(Screaming)

39:12.580 --> 39:13.570
Pete!

39:13.610 --> 39:16.170
Oh my God!
- Josh.

39:16.220 --> 39:17.870
- Wait!
- Get off him!

39:17.920 --> 39:19.410
- What did your
buddy call you?

39:19.450 --> 39:20.542
- Josh.

39:20.590 --> 39:21.887
- Not this guy.

39:21.920 --> 39:23.888
He's off limits.
So is his girlfriend.

39:23.920 --> 39:26.230
It's part of the deal.

39:26.260 --> 39:27.887
(Groaning)

39:27.930 --> 39:28.920
- Get out!

39:30.130 --> 39:31.256
(Grunts)

39:31.300 --> 39:32.699
(Panting and growling)

39:32.730 --> 39:33.925
(Pete screaming)

39:38.270 --> 39:40.534
(Suzanna screaming)

39:41.580 --> 39:44.208
- I know that I have strayed.

39:44.240 --> 39:48.040
I have been an angry man,
a spiteful man.

39:48.080 --> 39:50.720
But now I beg of you, please...

39:50.750 --> 39:52.889
(Suzanna screaming)

39:53.890 --> 39:56.712
...let me have this.

39:56.760 --> 40:02.699
Let this night end for me
with a healthy wife and child.

40:02.730 --> 40:05.597
And I swear to you, God...

40:05.630 --> 40:10.067
I shall live the rest of my days
as your unfailing servant.

40:10.100 --> 40:12.159
If I should live 100 years,

40:13.270 --> 40:16.604
everyday will be spent...

40:19.780 --> 40:20.975
as a good man.

40:21.010 --> 40:23.069
(Suzanna screaming)

40:25.190 --> 40:26.510
Please, Lord.

40:27.690 --> 40:30.113
(Baby crying)

40:44.470 --> 40:46.768
(Crying)

40:58.450 --> 40:59.417
- Mr. Waite?

40:59.450 --> 41:01.009
- Yes?

41:01.990 --> 41:04.118
- Would you like
to meet your son?

41:04.160 --> 41:05.480
(Sobs)

41:07.760 --> 41:08.727
- A son?

41:08.760 --> 41:14.631
- A healthy,
beautiful son.

41:14.670 --> 41:16.832
(Crying)

41:22.180 --> 41:24.501
- He looks just like you.

41:26.150 --> 41:27.970
Hold him.

41:36.020 --> 41:38.011
(Crying)

41:43.160 --> 41:45.595
- Thank you, Lord.

41:58.550 --> 42:01.349
(Siren wailing in distance)

42:08.250 --> 42:11.015
* Once I was young

42:11.060 --> 42:12.585
(Groans)

42:12.630 --> 42:16.555
* Inventing everything
that is wrong *

42:17.700 --> 42:20.863
* As long as you're aware

42:20.900 --> 42:23.870
* Not to stand too close

42:23.900 --> 42:28.770
* You're getting much
too serious **
