WEBVTT

00:00.037 --> 00:01.847
Previously on Sleepy Hollow...

00:01.847 --> 00:03.131
Do I know you?

00:03.132 --> 00:04.266
My name is Malcolm.

00:04.267 --> 00:06.201
Diana said start with
Dreyfuss' assistant,

00:06.202 --> 00:07.602
not grab dinner.

00:07.603 --> 00:11.008
I can use a remote link
to clone Ashley's SIM card.

00:11.009 --> 00:13.143
That way, if and when Dreyfuss calls,

00:13.144 --> 00:15.670
we can use cell tower
triangulation to locate him.

00:15.671 --> 00:17.289
It's the Gjallerhorn of Heimdal, right?

00:17.290 --> 00:19.424
Collector out of Dubai is
looking to track it down.

00:19.425 --> 00:21.648
I'd ask if you're in, but
you're out of the game, right?

00:21.649 --> 00:22.860
Not out out.

00:22.861 --> 00:25.563
I've come to restore
you to all your glory.

00:25.564 --> 00:29.033
I am getting the gang

00:29.034 --> 00:30.268
back together again.

00:30.269 --> 00:33.705
My young Rider of Pestilence

00:33.706 --> 00:36.541
and my Rider of Famine.

00:36.542 --> 00:41.246
That will leave just one
last totem, Jobe: war.

00:41.247 --> 00:43.114
Our enemy, Dreyfuss,

00:43.115 --> 00:46.050
seeks to raise the Four
Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

00:51.156 --> 00:53.358
In the bleak winter of 1777,

00:53.359 --> 00:56.294
the Continental Army
faced their breaking point.

00:56.295 --> 01:00.531
One man saved them,
inspired them to fight on.

01:00.532 --> 01:03.201
My good and loyal officers and soldiers,

01:03.202 --> 01:06.104
these truly are the times that...

01:06.105 --> 01:07.572
that...

01:10.276 --> 01:13.044
That try men's and women's souls.

01:13.045 --> 01:14.412
Thanks.

01:14.413 --> 01:17.148
These are the times that
try men's and women's souls.

01:17.149 --> 01:19.117
Your fortitude in these
conditions is proof

01:19.118 --> 01:21.085
you possess the strength to contend for

01:21.086 --> 01:22.389
the independence of this nation.

01:22.390 --> 01:23.288
Yes!

01:23.289 --> 01:24.789
Yes, indeed!

01:24.790 --> 01:26.591
Huzzah! Very well said

01:26.592 --> 01:28.793
and said very well!

01:28.794 --> 01:31.229
Crane, we are not even a minute in.

01:34.166 --> 01:36.167
Not that your enthusiasm
isn't appreciated

01:36.168 --> 01:39.337
by the cutest of colonial militia.

01:39.338 --> 01:43.274
Let us march to stay
warm and keep up morale.

01:46.512 --> 01:47.712
One...

01:54.153 --> 01:56.854
Not historically
accurate enough for you?

01:56.855 --> 01:59.357
Well, the choreography
is so stiff and stolid,

01:59.358 --> 02:01.492
it's practically a minuet.

02:01.493 --> 02:03.194
These are enlisted men; it should be

02:03.195 --> 02:05.997
a rowdy spree.

02:05.998 --> 02:09.199
No one else seems to mind.

02:09.201 --> 02:12.837
They're more interested in
posterity than the present.

02:12.838 --> 02:14.339
'Tis a shame.

02:14.340 --> 02:17.708
Theater is to be relished in the moment.

02:20.312 --> 02:24.182
To think the travails of
Valley Forge would be honored

02:24.183 --> 02:27.318
centuries later on
the boards by these...

02:27.319 --> 02:29.487
brave young souls.

02:29.488 --> 02:31.255
Shh!

02:31.256 --> 02:32.990
God's blood, man.

02:32.991 --> 02:34.692
This is a theater, not a morgue!

02:34.693 --> 02:36.561
Sit down.

02:36.562 --> 02:38.329
Bravo!

02:38.330 --> 02:40.264
Brava! And bravi!

02:40.265 --> 02:41.499
Sir...

02:41.500 --> 02:43.368
Hi! Oh, my gosh!

02:43.369 --> 02:45.269
So, did you guys like it?

02:45.270 --> 02:47.171
Now, you, Miss Molly,

02:47.172 --> 02:48.806
are a natural-born actor.

02:50.312 --> 02:51.855
But your dancing, though enthusiastic,

02:51.856 --> 02:53.039
lacking a little precision...

02:53.040 --> 02:55.179
Okay, you made us so proud up here.

02:56.915 --> 02:58.349
Did you ask her yet?

02:58.350 --> 03:00.218
Uh, yeah, well, Mom,

03:00.219 --> 03:03.388
Kendra is having a sleepover
for all of the girls in the cast,

03:03.389 --> 03:06.824
and if you'd rather I go home
with you, I'd really like to...

03:06.825 --> 03:09.160
No, no, it's not a school night.

03:09.161 --> 03:10.294
Go crazy.

03:11.563 --> 03:12.864
Oh.

03:12.865 --> 03:14.131
I'm so proud.

03:16.235 --> 03:18.202
Things seem very well between you two.

03:18.203 --> 03:20.505
You mean compared to her
imaginary friend coming to life

03:20.506 --> 03:22.006
and trying to kill me?

03:23.375 --> 03:25.443
I'm trying to let go a little bit.

03:25.444 --> 03:28.045
It's not so easy with
a madman on the loose.

03:28.046 --> 03:31.282
All the more reason to
savor these moments of joy.

03:32.518 --> 03:34.919
Theater.

03:34.920 --> 03:36.788
You sure you weren't an actor?

03:36.789 --> 03:40.758
Well, not unless you include
John of Gaunt in the bath.

03:40.759 --> 03:43.761
This royal throne of kings,

03:43.762 --> 03:46.330
this scepter'd isle,

03:46.331 --> 03:48.433
this earth of majesty,

03:48.434 --> 03:51.369
this seat of Mars,

03:51.370 --> 03:52.870
this...

03:54.273 --> 03:55.673
Ah.

03:55.674 --> 03:57.475
Agent Thoma...? Agent Thomas?

03:57.476 --> 04:02.046
Seems our search for Dreyfuss
is nearing a conclusion.

04:04.000 --> 04:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:12.791 --> 04:14.192
Something amiss?

04:14.193 --> 04:16.527
You ever get that feeling like...

04:16.528 --> 04:18.963
someone just walked over your grave?

04:18.964 --> 04:23.468
In my case, that may
have actually happened.

04:23.469 --> 04:24.869
Twice.

04:27.473 --> 04:29.106
It's nice to see you

04:29.107 --> 04:31.209
back in touch with
your sartorial senses.

04:31.210 --> 04:35.279
Coming from you, that is
high praise indeed, my friend.

04:35.280 --> 04:38.282
I did let things go a little, didn't I?

04:38.283 --> 04:40.218
Guess I just needed to get a few things

04:40.219 --> 04:42.320
out of my system.

04:42.321 --> 04:46.023
Have you checked in on
our houseguests recently?

04:46.024 --> 04:49.193
The Avatars of Pestilence and
Famine are resting comfortably.

04:49.194 --> 04:52.163
Any progress on a way to
heal the Horseman of Death?

04:52.164 --> 04:53.865
I'm working on it, Malcolm.

04:53.866 --> 04:56.567
Good, good, good. And the last horseman?

04:56.568 --> 04:58.169
I'm attending to the acquisition

04:58.170 --> 05:00.204
of the Rider of War's totem personally.

05:00.205 --> 05:03.674
The Turricula Ignis will
be in your possession soon.

05:03.675 --> 05:07.979
I must confess, Jobe, I am feeling...

05:07.980 --> 05:09.981
celebratory.

05:09.982 --> 05:12.617
How about a quick constitutional

05:12.618 --> 05:17.221
and a fine, upstanding cut of beef, hmm?

05:17.222 --> 05:19.090
There's a place within striking distance

05:19.091 --> 05:22.927
said to have the best aged
porterhouse in three states.

05:22.928 --> 05:26.764
Bury the lede, why don't you, Jobe?

05:26.765 --> 05:28.299
Anything for you, Malcolm.

05:31.603 --> 05:34.038
Shall we?

05:34.039 --> 05:36.173
A window into Dreyfuss' world.

05:36.174 --> 05:38.676
Excellent work.

05:38.677 --> 05:40.177
It's no big deal.

05:40.178 --> 05:41.546
We just cloned his
assistant's cell phone

05:41.547 --> 05:43.214
and then cracked the sharing protocols

05:43.215 --> 05:45.049
between it and his personal laptop,

05:45.050 --> 05:46.884
which gave us access to his webcam.

05:46.885 --> 05:48.786
Can this tell us where he is?

05:48.787 --> 05:50.288
Eventually.

05:50.289 --> 05:52.872
Right now, he's mirroring his IP
address through seven countries,

05:52.873 --> 05:54.091
but I'm trying to isolate it.

05:54.092 --> 05:55.760
Dreyfuss isn't acting like someone

05:55.761 --> 05:58.095
looking to burn the world to a cinder.

05:58.096 --> 05:59.664
Maybe he's got other plans.

06:00.999 --> 06:02.500
In many traditions,

06:02.501 --> 06:05.002
Norse myth, Hindu spiritualism,

06:05.003 --> 06:07.338
an apocalypse is a
time of transformation.

06:07.339 --> 06:10.274
Now there's an interesting hypothesis.

06:10.275 --> 06:13.077
The Horsemen summoned
not to end the world,

06:13.078 --> 06:15.379
but to forge it into something new.

06:15.380 --> 06:17.715
The symbol

06:17.716 --> 06:20.184
he's been painting...

06:20.185 --> 06:21.852
may support that theory.

06:23.088 --> 06:25.022
Now, I know I've got it over here.

06:25.023 --> 06:27.158
I know I do.

06:29.161 --> 06:30.661
Yes.

06:32.164 --> 06:34.966
You've seen that symbol before?

06:34.967 --> 06:38.502
I may not have an eidetic memory
like my man Crane, but I do know

06:38.503 --> 06:40.404
my glyphs, runes and symbols.

06:40.405 --> 06:42.908
See, I've been brushing up on
my knowledge of occult societies.

06:42.909 --> 06:46.143
This occult order, they
originated the symbol.

06:46.144 --> 06:48.245
An order known as the "Arma Mutata."

06:50.148 --> 06:51.782
Yes.

06:51.783 --> 06:56.854
In the early 16th century, there
was strife in the Masonic order.

06:56.855 --> 06:59.857
One faction splintered off...

07:02.661 --> 07:05.096
...and ventured down a far darker path.

07:05.097 --> 07:07.832
They called themselves Arma Mutata.

07:07.833 --> 07:10.334
Now, rather than seeking

07:10.335 --> 07:11.902
a greater understanding of the world,

07:11.903 --> 07:13.304
like the Masons proper,

07:13.305 --> 07:17.908
the Arma Mutata sought to
change the world for the better.

07:17.909 --> 07:19.810
Sounds like fanatics.

07:19.811 --> 07:22.079
"Fanatic" is too kind a term.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.648
The Arma Mutata believed

07:23.649 --> 07:26.684
the instruments for this great change

07:26.685 --> 07:29.086
were the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse.

07:29.087 --> 07:30.621
They sought to raise them

07:30.622 --> 07:32.957
by bonding them to human hosts.

07:32.958 --> 07:34.291
But in order to do so,

07:34.292 --> 07:36.293
they required powerful,
supernatural artifacts.

07:36.294 --> 07:37.628
Yes.

07:37.629 --> 07:40.331
Uh, Dreyfuss used scales
charged by the hunger demon

07:40.332 --> 07:42.133
and a scroll charged by that djinn...

07:42.134 --> 07:44.068
To raise the Horsemen
of Pestilence and Famine.

07:44.069 --> 07:45.212
The Headless Horseman

07:45.213 --> 07:47.171
already has one of these totems, right?

07:47.172 --> 07:48.873
That ax of his.

07:48.874 --> 07:50.508
So what about the Horseman of War?

07:50.509 --> 07:53.310
Dreyfuss is gonna have to find
and charge that totem next.

07:53.311 --> 07:54.578
Here.

07:54.579 --> 07:56.347
Uh, "The great totem

07:56.348 --> 07:59.083
"used to summon the
Rider of War is named

07:59.084 --> 08:01.318
Turricula Ignis."

08:01.319 --> 08:02.987
- Weapon of fire.
- Indeed.

08:02.988 --> 08:06.590
Here. "The Arma Mutata
believed it to be hidden

08:06.591 --> 08:11.228
somewhere in America during
the Revolutionary War."

08:12.831 --> 08:14.331
That's the proximity alarm.

08:16.735 --> 08:18.402
Right there.

08:21.973 --> 08:23.774
She's stolen a tome.

08:26.044 --> 08:28.312
I'm going after her.

08:30.582 --> 08:32.416
No sign of our thief
in the east tunnels.

08:32.417 --> 08:34.552
Understood.

08:34.553 --> 08:36.620
I shall meet you at the next juncture.

08:44.129 --> 08:45.362
Cute.

08:45.363 --> 08:48.032
And takes some burly core strength.

08:48.033 --> 08:49.400
Give back what you took.

08:51.470 --> 08:53.304
Come and get it.

09:45.994 --> 09:52.594
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#33FF00"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

09:55.114 --> 09:57.775
It was like she knew my
moods before I made them.

09:57.776 --> 09:59.577
But you didn't recognize her?

09:59.578 --> 10:02.546
No. But she did have that
same Arma Mutata symbol

10:02.547 --> 10:03.781
tattooed on her arm.

10:03.782 --> 10:05.883
So, she's working with or for Dreyfuss.

10:05.884 --> 10:07.418
She stole that book to bring to him.

10:07.419 --> 10:08.819
So, which book was it?

10:08.820 --> 10:10.087
It might offer us a clue

10:10.088 --> 10:11.671
as to where the Totem of War is hidden.

10:11.672 --> 10:13.624
I just went through the
Secret Histories. Uh...

10:13.625 --> 10:15.426
The only book I see
that's unaccounted for

10:15.427 --> 10:16.994
is from 1780,

10:16.995 --> 10:18.262
one of the very first.

10:18.263 --> 10:21.832
That volume contained bills
of lading, shipping logs,

10:21.833 --> 10:24.969
uh, construction and
surveying tables mostly.

10:24.970 --> 10:28.305
But there was a sort of vague account

10:28.306 --> 10:29.940
of a courier mission

10:29.941 --> 10:32.543
ordered by Washington down to Maryland

10:32.544 --> 10:34.879
- in the fall of that year.
- In 1780?

10:34.880 --> 10:36.380
- Uh-huh.
- How many couriers?

10:36.381 --> 10:37.644
What were they delivering?

10:37.645 --> 10:40.150
Um... give me a minute.

10:40.151 --> 10:44.221
Uh... not eidetic, lots of mnemonic.

10:46.157 --> 10:48.225
Mm. Two.

10:48.226 --> 10:49.727
Two couriers.

10:49.728 --> 10:51.562
They were beset by British troops,

10:51.563 --> 10:54.331
and the farmstead they had
taken shelter in was set on fire.

10:54.332 --> 10:57.735
Forcing a retreat, but
not the mission's failure.

10:57.736 --> 10:59.937
Was there a part of the
war you weren't a part of?

10:59.938 --> 11:01.772
The Treaty of Paris.

11:01.773 --> 11:03.340
And most of the naval engagements.

11:03.341 --> 11:05.309
My sea legs are a trifle shaky.

11:05.310 --> 11:07.544
This mission... what
were you sent to courier?

11:07.545 --> 11:08.879
A wooden box.

11:08.880 --> 11:11.682
The contents of which were
privy only to my companion,

11:11.683 --> 11:13.917
none other than Benjamin Banneker.

11:15.220 --> 11:16.720
Ben Banneker?

11:16.721 --> 11:17.955
So this was

11:17.956 --> 11:20.294
after you delivered that
letter from Washington,

11:20.295 --> 11:22.897
tried to recruit him
to Washington's cause...

11:22.898 --> 11:25.900
But before he'd agreed to
become one of Washington's men.

11:25.901 --> 11:27.902
We traveled together

11:27.903 --> 11:31.072
far beyond enemy lines.

11:31.819 --> 11:33.082
Does our good fortune

11:33.083 --> 11:35.225
continue to hold, Mr. Crane?

11:35.226 --> 11:36.726
For now.

11:36.727 --> 11:38.862
No sign of patrols.

11:44.435 --> 11:46.469
Are you certain the parcel is secure?

11:46.470 --> 11:48.872
It is safe, below the farmstead

11:48.873 --> 11:50.907
in a cache of my own design.

11:50.908 --> 11:52.409
Very good.

11:52.410 --> 11:54.644
Whatever it is must be valuable indeed

11:54.645 --> 11:56.646
for you to deliver it personally.

11:56.647 --> 11:57.947
Curious, are we?

11:57.948 --> 12:01.751
As only a man who's risked
his skin for days can be.

12:04.255 --> 12:07.757
All I can tell you is that
which we have now safeguarded

12:07.758 --> 12:11.628
could be used to spark a
conflict beyond all others.

12:13.597 --> 12:15.298
As to why we are here,

12:15.299 --> 12:17.867
aside from present company,

12:17.868 --> 12:19.602
I do not trust our founders with it

12:19.603 --> 12:22.572
any more than those whose
tyranny they seek to shrug off.

12:22.573 --> 12:24.574
You know I share your concerns

12:24.575 --> 12:28.478
with regards to how social
issues will be handled, Ben.

12:30.214 --> 12:34.317
But the beauty of democracy is
that all voices will be heard.

12:34.318 --> 12:36.419
In a perfect world, yes.

12:38.322 --> 12:41.091
But the one we live in is far from that.

12:41.092 --> 12:42.892
Change is gradual, Ben.

12:44.261 --> 12:47.130
'Tis like a garden growing

12:47.131 --> 12:48.498
and blossoming.

12:48.499 --> 12:51.768
Belief in a noble
cause: that is the water

12:51.769 --> 12:54.804
we use to tend to it.

12:54.805 --> 12:57.674
And 'tis my belief

12:57.675 --> 13:01.778
that the garden of our future
will be bright and verdant.

13:01.779 --> 13:04.647
You have a way with words, Mr. Crane.

13:04.648 --> 13:06.750
Thank you.

13:06.751 --> 13:09.118
Have you ever spent time on the boards?

13:10.654 --> 13:12.355
As an actor?

13:12.356 --> 13:14.457
Good grief, no.

13:16.327 --> 13:19.429
No, mercifully, war took me from London

13:19.430 --> 13:22.298
and spared the audiences that ignominy.

13:26.036 --> 13:27.504
Go! Go!

13:33.377 --> 13:34.444
Both of them!

13:34.445 --> 13:36.613
Benjamin, I'm so sorry.

13:36.614 --> 13:38.948
Perhaps it's for the best.

13:38.949 --> 13:40.972
The burnt wreckage will
better hide the cache below

13:40.973 --> 13:42.819
and its contents.

13:42.820 --> 13:44.921
Your life's work is inside.

13:44.922 --> 13:46.589
Paper.

13:46.590 --> 13:49.526
They're drawings, objects.

13:49.527 --> 13:53.563
A man carries his genes
in his heart and mind...

13:53.564 --> 13:58.201
along with a growing faith
in the garden of noble causes

13:58.202 --> 14:01.271
you and your fellows seek to engender.

14:07.945 --> 14:10.680
Banneker believed that
which we safeguarded

14:10.681 --> 14:14.417
could be used to spark a
conflict beyond all others.

14:14.418 --> 14:17.554
So it stands to reason...

14:17.555 --> 14:19.289
it could be the Totem of War.

14:20.658 --> 14:23.059
We're not that far from
where that barn used to be.

14:23.060 --> 14:25.495
We need to get to it
before Dreyfuss' agent can.

14:25.496 --> 14:27.096
I'm gonna hang back here.

14:27.097 --> 14:29.098
If Alex, Jake and I
put our heads together,

14:29.099 --> 14:30.882
we might be able to
beat Dreyfuss' encryption

14:30.883 --> 14:32.235
and find out where he is.

14:32.236 --> 14:33.937
Very good.

14:34.872 --> 14:36.539
Godspeed, all.

14:44.715 --> 14:46.516
This can't be possible.

14:46.517 --> 14:48.551
You said it burned down.

14:48.552 --> 14:50.320
Well, it did.

14:50.321 --> 14:51.888
Right before my eyes.

14:51.889 --> 14:53.656
The mint-glazed

14:53.657 --> 14:55.458
marrow reduction...

14:55.459 --> 14:57.460
my God, it was just so tasty.

14:57.461 --> 14:59.405
They source it from an
organic whey-fed pork farm

14:59.406 --> 15:01.106
in the Hudson Valley.

15:01.999 --> 15:04.000
So delicious.

15:04.935 --> 15:07.437
We've died and gone to Brooklyn.

15:09.540 --> 15:11.274
Welcome to Kestrel & Freia.

15:12.710 --> 15:16.546
Yes. This... structure,
how long has it been here?

15:16.547 --> 15:20.416
The original house and
barn burned in the 1780s.

15:20.417 --> 15:24.254
My partner Ruby and I
rebuilt it exactly as it was,

15:24.255 --> 15:26.155
by hand, in 2012.

15:26.156 --> 15:27.590
So this is a restaurant?

15:27.591 --> 15:28.992
It's a communal table.

15:30.094 --> 15:31.594
Do you have a reservation?

15:31.595 --> 15:33.930
Alas, no.

15:33.931 --> 15:36.332
We were hoping to take a
turn around the property.

15:36.333 --> 15:37.634
Mm, sorry.

15:37.635 --> 15:39.903
This is actually our home
as well as our business.

15:39.904 --> 15:41.571
But you can look at the Web site.

15:41.572 --> 15:43.172
I'm a DHS agent.

15:43.173 --> 15:46.943
Are you? Michelle Obama and her
family just ate here last week.

15:48.779 --> 15:52.048
Right. Well, in that case,
a reservation for two.

15:56.153 --> 15:58.554
Our next available
booking is six weeks out.

16:01.418 --> 16:02.961
I'm so psyched you're on board, Mills.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.327
I'm still running point, yes?

16:04.328 --> 16:05.995
Yeah. It's all you.

16:05.996 --> 16:08.164
Just shoot us a list
of names to approve,

16:08.165 --> 16:10.433
and we'll start hiring
the rest of your team.

16:10.434 --> 16:12.302
Okay, well, when is the drop dead?

16:12.303 --> 16:14.304
I've got a few loose ends
here in D.C. to wrap up.

16:14.305 --> 16:16.639
Yeah, it's a few weeks at most.

16:16.640 --> 16:18.074
You're our top choice.

16:18.075 --> 16:19.943
But don't think there isn't a long list

16:19.944 --> 16:23.212
of people that are willing
to pay us to do this job.

16:27.351 --> 16:29.152
Jackpot!

16:29.153 --> 16:31.354
Or... close enough to yell "jackpot"

16:31.355 --> 16:33.890
without it being a total
and complete jackpot yet.

16:33.891 --> 16:35.491
Jackpot adjacent works for me.

16:35.492 --> 16:37.460
I was able to break through
enough of Dreyfuss' encryption

16:37.461 --> 16:39.604
to get a general area between
a handful of cell towers

16:39.605 --> 16:41.531
out in the middle of
the woods in Maryland.

16:41.532 --> 16:44.233
Okay, all right, so... do we
think this is where Dreyfuss

16:44.234 --> 16:46.235
is holding totems and/or Horsemen?

16:46.236 --> 16:47.670
Only one way to find out.

16:47.671 --> 16:49.472
That's right.

16:52.209 --> 16:55.345
Let's hope that hostess
doesn't catch us sneaking in.

16:55.346 --> 16:57.981
I've met demons that
were easier to get past.

16:57.982 --> 17:00.683
Indeed. I've never known
anyone guard a reservation book

17:00.684 --> 17:02.185
with such intensity.

17:02.186 --> 17:03.820
Preposterous.

17:04.887 --> 17:06.723
Well, now...

17:06.723 --> 17:08.906
Banneker's farmstead may
have been rebuilt identically,

17:08.907 --> 17:11.294
but this has certainly been modernized.

17:11.295 --> 17:14.297
Still, I should be able
to locate his cache.

17:18.335 --> 17:20.169
I don't have time for this.

17:20.170 --> 17:22.372
Hand over the box. Now.

17:22.373 --> 17:25.174
Both of you, you need
to get out of here.

17:25.175 --> 17:26.476
Please.

17:29.213 --> 17:30.980
Ah.

17:30.981 --> 17:33.916
The gang's all here.

17:38.355 --> 17:40.790
You're wasting your time
trying to run away from me.

17:42.593 --> 17:45.028
I have all the time in the world.

17:45.029 --> 17:46.863
It's yours that is running out.

17:46.864 --> 17:49.232
An Atlantean Chronos crystal.

17:49.233 --> 17:50.333
Tempus Duratus...

17:59.343 --> 18:01.544
She's out but she's okay.

18:01.545 --> 18:03.179
This is it.

18:03.180 --> 18:04.781
Banneker's hidden treasure.

18:14.458 --> 18:16.659
The Totem of War.

18:18.462 --> 18:20.062
It's ours.

18:24.093 --> 18:26.354
Where ever she is, she is formidible.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.618
To get the better of Miss Jenny

18:27.619 --> 18:30.358
is remarkable, but to then dispatch

18:30.359 --> 18:32.452
- of the demon Jobe...
- Pretty solid proof

18:32.453 --> 18:34.629
she and Dreyfuss are
not on the same team.

18:34.630 --> 18:36.631
And yet she bears his mark.

18:36.632 --> 18:39.600
Unless... there is a remnant

18:39.601 --> 18:41.936
of Arma Mutata still in existence...

18:41.937 --> 18:44.138
and she's a part of it.

18:44.139 --> 18:46.507
I recognize her face from somewhere.

18:46.508 --> 18:48.576
Probably a watch list.

18:48.577 --> 18:50.545
How we doing on the Turricula Ignis?

18:51.480 --> 18:53.581
It is remarkable.

18:55.517 --> 18:57.385
The Arma Mutata believed it was cast

18:57.386 --> 19:00.388
on the same anvil used by Ares

19:00.389 --> 19:01.789
to forge his armor.

19:01.790 --> 19:03.424
It is said

19:03.425 --> 19:07.428
that the ironwork contains
shards of legendary blades:

19:07.429 --> 19:08.730
Asi...

19:08.731 --> 19:12.100
Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi...

19:12.101 --> 19:13.901
Excalibur.

19:15.904 --> 19:18.272
If she is Arma Mutata,

19:18.273 --> 19:21.175
does she want it for the
same reason as Dreyfuss?

19:21.176 --> 19:23.077
To raise the Horseman of War?

19:25.614 --> 19:27.815
You know what this
weapon is, do you not?

19:27.816 --> 19:30.451
Do you know what it's meant to do?

19:30.452 --> 19:33.454
I know that if you don't let me go,

19:33.455 --> 19:37.091
something terrible will happen.

19:40.129 --> 19:43.197
Dreyfuss has got security patrols

19:43.198 --> 19:44.632
all over the area.

19:44.633 --> 19:46.634
Mm.

19:46.635 --> 19:49.637
Okay, what's our next move?

19:52.007 --> 19:54.475
I'm not always gonna be
around to call the shots.

19:54.476 --> 19:56.711
What would you do in
this situation without me?

19:56.712 --> 19:59.881
Jenny, we wouldn't be in
this situation without you.

19:59.882 --> 20:02.517
Come on. A game plan.

20:02.518 --> 20:04.619
Let's call it a teachable moment.

20:05.687 --> 20:08.656
Okay. Well... we don't know for sure

20:08.657 --> 20:10.658
that that's Dreyfuss' place down there,

20:10.659 --> 20:12.593
so more recon's in order.

20:12.594 --> 20:15.062
Yeah. Until we get a
better lay of the land

20:15.063 --> 20:18.232
and who and how many are we up against.

20:18.233 --> 20:19.587
Great suggestions.

20:19.588 --> 20:21.689
Let's try it. Split up and sweep.

20:21.690 --> 20:23.725
You two take that way. I'll go that way.

20:23.726 --> 20:25.093
We'll meet back up here in 30.

20:25.094 --> 20:26.361
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:29.031 --> 20:32.200
The Turricula Ignis; why rob from us?

20:32.201 --> 20:33.902
Why track it down?

20:33.903 --> 20:35.303
What do you want it for?

20:35.304 --> 20:37.472
It's not safe here, you understand?

20:37.473 --> 20:39.908
They could be here at any moment.

20:39.909 --> 20:41.609
This is a DHS safe house.

20:41.610 --> 20:43.745
No one even knows we're here.

20:43.746 --> 20:45.647
Not the DHS, the demon.

20:45.648 --> 20:47.215
And his master.

20:48.150 --> 20:51.252
Malcolm Dreyfuss and Jobe.

20:51.253 --> 20:54.823
Dreyfuss won't rest until
he's got his hands on the gun.

20:54.824 --> 20:56.424
Until he's used it.

20:56.425 --> 20:57.859
What happens when he does?

20:57.860 --> 20:59.461
You know.

20:59.462 --> 21:01.029
You have to know.

21:01.030 --> 21:06.234
That gun, when you fire it,
it raises the Horseman of War.

21:08.270 --> 21:11.039
I am doing this to help you.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.340
And him.

21:15.778 --> 21:17.312
How about a name?

21:17.313 --> 21:20.715
I'm Diana. Agent Diana Thomas.

21:20.716 --> 21:23.551
My friend in the other
room is Ichabod Crane.

21:26.222 --> 21:27.222
And you?

21:27.223 --> 21:30.258
It's Lara.

21:30.259 --> 21:31.926
Lara.

21:34.797 --> 21:37.098
That is a start.

21:39.535 --> 21:42.537
You seem to know a lot about
Malcolm Dreyfuss and his plans.

21:42.538 --> 21:44.606
Indeed.

21:45.541 --> 21:47.842
And you have magic at your fingertips.

21:47.843 --> 21:51.980
An enchanted crystal
to dispose of a demon.

21:51.981 --> 21:53.648
It didn't destroy him.

21:53.649 --> 21:55.149
It just detained him.

21:55.150 --> 21:57.652
Nudged him outside of time for a bit.

21:59.288 --> 22:00.888
Time manipulation.

22:02.258 --> 22:04.025
That is powerful magic.

22:04.026 --> 22:05.960
That comes at a great risk.

22:05.961 --> 22:08.863
To be used only as a last resort.

22:08.864 --> 22:10.932
The spell is only temporary.

22:10.933 --> 22:12.667
Jobe will be back on the grid,

22:12.668 --> 22:14.869
and he knows I got my hands on the gun.

22:14.870 --> 22:16.271
He'll find us.

22:16.272 --> 22:18.039
When Dreyfuss fires that gun,

22:18.040 --> 22:22.343
your world will fall to pieces.

22:22.344 --> 22:23.845
We need to destroy the gun.

22:23.846 --> 22:25.013
Because if we don't,

22:25.014 --> 22:27.315
it will be a disaster like no other.

22:29.218 --> 22:32.887
Ball is in your court,
and the clock is ticking.

22:37.059 --> 22:39.727
Is it just me or was it weird

22:39.728 --> 22:42.230
what Jenny was saying about
not always being around?

22:42.231 --> 22:43.831
Look, it's her life.

22:43.832 --> 22:45.833
She makes her own choices.

22:45.834 --> 22:48.202
Besides, it's not even like
you're gonna notice she's gone

22:48.203 --> 22:51.005
now that your life
is all Missy-centric.

22:51.006 --> 22:55.410
Okay, sometimes I feel like
you aren't that into Missy.

22:55.411 --> 22:57.645
Now, I'd really like for my best friend

22:57.646 --> 23:01.182
and my girlfriend to get along.

23:01.183 --> 23:03.318
So she's officially
your girlfriend now, huh?

23:03.319 --> 23:05.486
What?

23:05.487 --> 23:06.788
Look.

23:08.324 --> 23:11.392
What are those, coffins?

23:11.393 --> 23:13.595
Four coffins.

23:13.596 --> 23:15.730
Yeah, and we know four
is not a good number.

23:15.731 --> 23:18.366
Four totems. Four riders.

23:19.602 --> 23:22.103
This must be where Pestilence and Famine

23:22.104 --> 23:23.838
lay their heads.

23:26.408 --> 23:29.410
The Headless Horseman's ax.

23:29.411 --> 23:33.214
If he's not in there, is he out here?

23:33.215 --> 23:34.616
Or arriving

23:34.617 --> 23:35.950
fashionably late.

23:35.951 --> 23:37.285
Sorry to crash the party.

23:37.286 --> 23:38.786
Mm.

23:38.787 --> 23:40.021
Yeah, we were just leaving.

23:40.022 --> 23:41.022
No, please,

23:41.023 --> 23:45.793
uninvited but not unwanted guests.

23:45.794 --> 23:47.428
Mr. Dreyfuss

23:47.429 --> 23:49.931
has some questions about
the current whereabouts

23:49.932 --> 23:53.067
of a very powerful and ancient firearm.

23:53.068 --> 23:55.303
And you...

23:55.304 --> 23:57.805
are gonna tell us where it is.

24:08.558 --> 24:10.792
Couple of babes in the woods.

24:10.860 --> 24:13.895
Ooh, ooh, not unlike
one of those, uh, uh,

24:13.896 --> 24:16.097
Grimm fairy tales, right, Jobe?

24:16.098 --> 24:17.908
Those don't end well, Malcolm.

24:17.909 --> 24:20.053
There's usually someone
that ends up getting

24:20.054 --> 24:21.836
burned or eaten

24:21.837 --> 24:24.739
or chopped up into tiny morsels

24:24.740 --> 24:27.575
and scattered to the winds, right?

24:27.576 --> 24:30.745
If you're trying to scare us,

24:30.746 --> 24:33.381
the rest of our team
will be here any minute.

24:35.017 --> 24:37.786
Mr. Wells.

24:38.921 --> 24:41.389
It is Jake Wells, right?

24:41.390 --> 24:44.192
And... Alex.

24:44.193 --> 24:45.593
Ms. Norwood.

24:45.594 --> 24:50.632
The only two employees of
the Vault, if memory serves.

24:50.633 --> 24:53.668
Yeah, now, the other members
of your so-called team,

24:53.669 --> 24:56.037
Crane, Thomas and Mills, yeah...

24:57.406 --> 25:01.876
...I'm so, so sorry to break it to you,

25:01.877 --> 25:05.146
but I'm afraid they're
out of their league.

25:08.384 --> 25:10.618
You knew we tapped your feed.

25:10.619 --> 25:13.021
That's right. That's right.

25:13.022 --> 25:16.958
Hacking my assistant's... phone.

25:16.959 --> 25:19.494
That was, uh, clever,

25:19.495 --> 25:22.263
to a degree, I guess, right?

25:24.266 --> 25:25.934
I'm an Internet billionaire.

25:25.935 --> 25:27.335
So think Big Brother.

25:27.336 --> 25:29.904
Think eye in the sky.

25:29.905 --> 25:32.006
You don't hack me.

25:34.143 --> 25:36.411
I hack...

25:39.482 --> 25:42.851
Still, I-I...

25:42.852 --> 25:44.853
I don't quite know everything.

25:44.854 --> 25:49.090
I still don't quite know
precisely where Ichabod Crane

25:49.091 --> 25:51.493
has taken my gun.

25:51.494 --> 25:54.662
Would you care to tell me where

25:54.663 --> 25:56.865
he has taken my...

26:00.236 --> 26:01.603
Okay, we've trusted you.

26:01.604 --> 26:03.238
Now you trust us.

26:03.239 --> 26:06.007
What do you know about this
gun and how do we destroy it?

26:06.008 --> 26:07.776
In order to dispose of a charged totem

26:07.777 --> 26:09.444
with the Turricula
Ignis' level of power,

26:09.445 --> 26:12.113
we need to take it to a
nexus of primal energy.

26:12.114 --> 26:14.449
I recall a mention of a primal nexus

26:14.450 --> 26:17.185
in the Compendium of Masonic History.

26:17.186 --> 26:20.922
'Tis a location rich
in powerful ley lines.

26:20.923 --> 26:23.591
Everything comes back to
ley lines and blood moons.

26:23.592 --> 26:25.593
Or glamour, if you're
dealing with witches.

26:25.594 --> 26:26.795
Just saying.

26:26.796 --> 26:28.029
No, you're right.

26:28.030 --> 26:29.964
Only a nexus point
where the ley lines cross

26:29.965 --> 26:31.533
is a safe place to destroy it.

26:31.534 --> 26:33.334
And there's one here, so...

26:33.335 --> 26:34.636
We don't know where Crane is.

26:34.637 --> 26:36.738
And if we did, we wouldn't tell you.

26:37.673 --> 26:38.673
No!

26:38.674 --> 26:39.674
Stop!

26:39.675 --> 26:41.643
Don't! Don't!

26:43.345 --> 26:45.313
Jake.

26:45.314 --> 26:46.314
No, no!

26:46.315 --> 26:47.315
Please stop!

26:51.821 --> 26:52.921
Alex.

26:58.127 --> 26:59.694
Wait...

26:59.695 --> 27:00.795
What did you do to him?!

27:00.796 --> 27:02.297
Would you...

27:02.298 --> 27:05.867
care to experience
that again, Mr. Wells?

27:05.868 --> 27:09.504
Oh, but this time... for real?

27:09.505 --> 27:11.406
Just don't... No.

27:11.407 --> 27:13.174
Please don't, okay?

27:14.376 --> 27:17.478
We're barking up the
wrong tree, Malcolm.

27:18.747 --> 27:21.683
She's the one we need to concentrate on.

27:21.684 --> 27:23.518
Her feelings for him

27:23.519 --> 27:26.154
are closer to the surface, so...

27:26.155 --> 27:27.155
Go to hell.

27:27.156 --> 27:28.189
- ...new.
- Stop!

27:28.190 --> 27:29.757
Don't! No! Stop.

27:29.758 --> 27:32.727
I'll tell you what I know.
I will tell you what I know.

27:32.728 --> 27:33.728
Okay?

27:33.729 --> 27:34.963
You back him off!

27:34.964 --> 27:36.431
I'll tell you what I know.

27:36.432 --> 27:38.199
Just, please, don't hurt her.

27:49.745 --> 27:52.413
Go on.

27:52.414 --> 27:55.183
I don't know where Crane is,

27:55.184 --> 27:58.286
but I do know where
he got his information.

28:01.524 --> 28:03.358
He had a reference book

28:03.359 --> 28:06.161
on the history of the Arma Mutata

28:06.162 --> 28:08.096
and the Turricula Ignis.

28:13.369 --> 28:14.902
The nexus is located here.

28:16.872 --> 28:19.607
So we're gonna have to
move this stuff right here.

28:19.608 --> 28:21.209
- Okay.
- Understood.

28:21.210 --> 28:23.411
Okay.

28:25.981 --> 28:29.517
The way you speak of
Dreyfuss' behavior...

28:31.453 --> 28:34.489
...it's as if you've
experienced it firsthand.

28:34.490 --> 28:36.257
I have.

28:36.258 --> 28:38.159
I've seen it up close.

28:40.162 --> 28:42.697
He's never cruel to me.
That's the crazy part.

28:43.666 --> 28:45.767
I grew up without my mother,

28:45.768 --> 28:47.669
and for the longest time,

28:47.670 --> 28:50.672
uh, Dreyfuss was the only
person that I could count on.

28:50.673 --> 28:54.475
Uh, I came to rely on him.

28:54.476 --> 28:57.812
I know better than anybody
what he wants to achieve.

29:01.951 --> 29:02.951
I'm sorry.

29:02.952 --> 29:04.552
No, no, don't, don't!

29:06.555 --> 29:08.498
Dreyfuss wants to unravel
the country, the world.

29:08.499 --> 29:10.491
He wants to destroy democracy

29:10.492 --> 29:11.659
and replace it with tyranny.

29:11.660 --> 29:12.763
And the most horrible thing

29:12.764 --> 29:15.964
is that he knows he's going to win.

29:15.965 --> 29:18.066
And I can't let that happen.

29:19.168 --> 29:20.868
This is the way things have to be.

29:20.869 --> 29:23.438
No, Lara. Lara, just open the door!

29:27.009 --> 29:28.476
A double cross.

29:36.563 --> 29:37.866
Lara lives here.

29:37.867 --> 29:39.801
If that's even her real name.

29:45.675 --> 29:47.809
Hmm.

29:53.849 --> 29:55.216
Enchanted crystals.

29:58.421 --> 30:00.021
Whoever she is,

30:00.022 --> 30:02.757
she has a clear understanding
of the supernatural.

30:02.758 --> 30:04.926
That would make sense if
Dreyfuss is her mentor.

30:04.927 --> 30:07.962
Wonder what he did to
sour that relationship.

30:09.799 --> 30:13.768
With a blaggard of that
sort, I dread to think.

30:13.769 --> 30:14.869
There's a ledge out here.

30:14.870 --> 30:16.471
I can climb out,

30:16.472 --> 30:18.106
work my way around to the door

30:18.107 --> 30:20.775
and open it from the other side.

30:20.776 --> 30:23.078
It is rather a narrow ledge.

30:23.079 --> 30:26.314
I'm not sitting this one out, Crane.

30:26.315 --> 30:28.917
We're gonna make sure
this gun never goes off.

30:28.918 --> 30:30.919
And when we find this Lara girl,

30:30.920 --> 30:32.120
she's gonna get an earful.

30:32.121 --> 30:34.222
If we find her.

30:36.258 --> 30:38.026
I put a tracer on her.

30:38.027 --> 30:39.627
My friend in the other room

30:39.628 --> 30:42.864
is Ichabod Crane.

30:42.865 --> 30:45.133
Something about her just felt off.

30:46.268 --> 30:49.504
You never cease to
surprise, Agent Thomas.

30:49.505 --> 30:52.540
Perhaps the day shall be ours.

31:00.783 --> 31:03.218
I know I shouldn't
have told them anything.

31:04.854 --> 31:06.855
I just...

31:08.791 --> 31:11.092
It was too much.

31:12.962 --> 31:15.063
And I couldn't bear it.

31:18.167 --> 31:20.935
What did he do to you?

31:20.936 --> 31:23.138
He just touched me,

31:23.139 --> 31:25.173
and it burned.

31:25.174 --> 31:28.343
Down to my soul.

31:28.344 --> 31:29.978
And then...

31:31.881 --> 31:33.915
...he killed you.

31:40.055 --> 31:43.791
I know it didn't really
happen, but it felt like it did.

31:45.661 --> 31:48.029
It was so real, Alex.

31:48.030 --> 31:50.198
It felt so real.

31:55.805 --> 31:57.906
You were really brave, Jake.

32:00.209 --> 32:03.645
When Jobe looked at
me, he kind of, like...

32:03.646 --> 32:06.014
looked inside.

32:06.015 --> 32:08.149
And he said

32:08.150 --> 32:10.819
that thing about...

32:10.820 --> 32:12.821
how I felt about you.

32:12.822 --> 32:14.222
We're best friends.

32:14.223 --> 32:15.423
I get it.

32:17.359 --> 32:19.160
Best friends.

32:19.161 --> 32:21.095
Yeah.

32:21.864 --> 32:23.865
About that.

32:23.866 --> 32:25.733
There's, um...

32:25.734 --> 32:28.836
there's something I've been
meaning to talk to you about.

32:37.146 --> 32:38.246
Time to go.

32:46.789 --> 32:48.256
She's close.

32:57.433 --> 32:59.901
The nexus of which Lara spoke.

32:59.902 --> 33:01.736
A place of

33:01.737 --> 33:03.838
great magical power.

33:03.839 --> 33:06.374
So this is the real Eternal Flame.

33:06.375 --> 33:08.943
And the one at JFK's
grave at Arlington is...

33:08.944 --> 33:13.715
Even that marvel pales in comparison.

33:13.716 --> 33:16.050
The Flame of the Eternals.

33:17.887 --> 33:20.655
Legend posits that this is an offshoot

33:20.656 --> 33:24.058
of the forge used by Hephaestus,
the blacksmith of the gods,

33:24.059 --> 33:27.161
to hammer out his mythic weapons.

33:29.298 --> 33:31.399
There she is.

33:54.957 --> 33:56.925
Promethean flame,

33:56.926 --> 33:59.327
by the hand of your master Vulcan,

33:59.328 --> 34:01.429
I call you forth.

34:16.045 --> 34:18.179
Weapon of War,

34:18.179 --> 34:21.081
return to the conflagration
that shaped you.

34:30.326 --> 34:32.126
Thank you, Jobe.

34:32.127 --> 34:35.862
That would have been a terrible waste of

34:35.864 --> 34:37.331
a perfectly lovely weapon.

34:37.333 --> 34:39.000
Malcolm,

34:39.001 --> 34:40.234
don't do this.

34:46.842 --> 34:49.409
Well, what do you know?

34:50.946 --> 34:53.781
You're a bit ahead of
schedule, aren't you?

34:56.018 --> 34:57.118
Stand down, Dreyfuss.

34:58.120 --> 35:01.122
Not another step, demon.

35:05.394 --> 35:07.161
You people.

35:08.731 --> 35:11.833
You get more and more
troublesome every day.

35:11.834 --> 35:13.167
Diana, please,

35:13.168 --> 35:15.136
you need to leave here, now.

35:16.739 --> 35:20.508
Showdown at the Eternal Flame Corral.

35:20.509 --> 35:23.578
Who has the quicker trigger finger,

35:23.579 --> 35:25.613
Agent Thomas...

35:25.614 --> 35:27.315
or...

35:30.252 --> 35:32.520
No!

35:37.259 --> 35:38.793
How...

35:38.794 --> 35:41.796
How could I be m-mor...
mortally wounded?

35:41.797 --> 35:44.232
I... I have so much left

35:44.233 --> 35:45.733
to finish.

35:52.975 --> 35:54.342
Ooh.

35:55.878 --> 35:57.845
Pretty neat trick, right?

35:59.281 --> 36:02.683
Yeah, don't... don't
try this at home, kids.

36:04.420 --> 36:06.521
He's immortal.

36:06.522 --> 36:08.689
The Philosopher's Stone ceremony...

36:08.690 --> 36:10.158
it worked.

36:10.893 --> 36:12.827
Run!

36:13.562 --> 36:15.630
Solis Flamma!

36:24.156 --> 36:25.556
Tell me you got something.

36:25.557 --> 36:27.541
Dreyfuss doesn't have
Headless with him yet,

36:27.542 --> 36:28.559
but he does have his ax.

36:28.560 --> 36:30.861
That Arma Mutata symbol
was all over the place.

36:30.862 --> 36:32.663
Research, runes, I think.

36:32.664 --> 36:34.484
Whoa, whoa.

36:36.902 --> 36:38.336
Marine One?

36:38.337 --> 36:39.503
The president's ride?

36:39.504 --> 36:41.339
We're on the edge of
Catoctin State Park.

36:41.340 --> 36:43.507
That's 15 miles outside
of Thurmont, Maryland.

36:43.508 --> 36:44.842
Camp David.

36:44.843 --> 36:46.711
The presidential retreat.

36:46.712 --> 36:48.679
Dreyfuss is raising the Horseman

36:48.680 --> 36:50.781
to take out our commander in chief.

36:53.485 --> 36:54.986
We need to move fast.

36:54.987 --> 36:57.622
That solar crystal I threw, it
won't take them long to recover.

36:57.623 --> 36:59.686
So we're just gonna
leave them with that gun?

36:59.687 --> 37:02.827
No. We cannot allow
ourselves to be targets.

37:02.828 --> 37:04.028
Absolutely, not.

37:04.029 --> 37:05.692
When Dreyfuss creates
the Horseman of War,

37:05.693 --> 37:06.993
it's the beginning of the end.

37:08.200 --> 37:10.601
Agent Thomas,

37:10.602 --> 37:13.204
Lara, we have a problem.

37:13.205 --> 37:14.672
That hurt.

37:16.008 --> 37:17.608
Easy, Jobe.

37:17.609 --> 37:19.677
Need them all in one piece.

37:19.678 --> 37:22.613
Well, one of them anyway.

37:23.382 --> 37:24.448
No.

37:24.449 --> 37:26.250
Malcolm, don't.

37:26.251 --> 37:27.251
Please.

37:27.252 --> 37:28.853
And... wh...

37:28.854 --> 37:31.889
why not?

37:31.890 --> 37:33.758
See, if I don't,

37:33.759 --> 37:36.894
that means you won't ever be,

37:36.895 --> 37:39.063
will you?

37:39.064 --> 37:41.265
No, no, no, I've...

37:41.266 --> 37:43.834
I've seen the future I want,

37:43.835 --> 37:45.903
and you're a very big part of it.

37:47.306 --> 37:50.207
"Won't ever be"? What does that mean?

37:51.343 --> 37:54.445
The blue crystal you hurled at Jobe...

37:56.281 --> 37:58.282
...that was not the
extent of your ability

37:58.283 --> 37:59.683
to manipulate time, was it?

38:05.090 --> 38:08.426
Hardly.

38:08.427 --> 38:10.227
She...

38:10.228 --> 38:11.896
is from the future.

38:15.334 --> 38:17.268
A future, I might add,

38:17.269 --> 38:19.770
that I'm about to create.

38:22.774 --> 38:24.675
It's true, isn't it?

38:26.078 --> 38:27.645
Crane...

38:27.646 --> 38:31.449
a-a very different Crane...

38:31.450 --> 38:33.184
helped me to come back.

38:33.185 --> 38:35.186
So that I could destroy the gun

38:35.187 --> 38:36.787
and protect you.

38:36.788 --> 38:40.357
So that Dreyfuss couldn't make
you into the Horseman of War.

38:41.993 --> 38:45.529
He raised me once you were gone,

38:45.530 --> 38:48.432
and told me you had died.

38:48.433 --> 38:51.302
Molly?

38:51.303 --> 38:52.837
Oh, my God.

38:54.005 --> 38:55.940
Yesterday was the last day

38:55.941 --> 38:57.808
that I remember seeing you alive.

38:57.809 --> 39:00.311
After the Washington play,

39:00.312 --> 39:03.080
I went to a sleepover
at my friend's house,

39:03.081 --> 39:06.851
and in the morning, they...

39:06.852 --> 39:08.853
just told me you were gone.

39:09.788 --> 39:11.122
Excuse me.

39:11.123 --> 39:14.558
So sorry to interrupt,
but I have to ask,

39:14.559 --> 39:16.560
the World Series...

39:18.063 --> 39:19.797
...do the Cubs ever get there again,

39:19.798 --> 39:21.832
or was that just a one-off?

39:21.833 --> 39:24.702
Just leave her, Malcolm.

39:24.703 --> 39:27.304
Choose someone else.

39:27.305 --> 39:28.539
You don't need her.

39:28.540 --> 39:32.143
Oh, no, no, no, I...
of course I need her.

39:32.144 --> 39:34.311
Otherwise, how will I

39:34.312 --> 39:38.382
mold little Molly into you?

39:38.383 --> 39:40.584
You will never get the chance.

39:40.585 --> 39:41.919
Actually,

39:41.920 --> 39:45.089
I've already begun on
that front, my friend.

39:46.425 --> 39:49.126
And I do need a Horseman of War, so...

39:49.127 --> 39:50.728
Forgive me, Agent Thomas,

39:50.729 --> 39:52.763
but you're just...

39:52.764 --> 39:55.900
you're such a perfect fit for the job.

39:56.868 --> 39:58.602
Malcolm,

39:58.603 --> 40:01.439
when you first took me in,

40:01.440 --> 40:05.109
you were kind and you were generous.

40:05.110 --> 40:07.711
You taught me to stand up for myself,

40:07.712 --> 40:11.549
to fight for what I believe.

40:11.550 --> 40:14.985
There is so much potential in you.

40:14.986 --> 40:17.721
You don't have to do this...

40:17.722 --> 40:20.558
become a tyrant.

40:23.495 --> 40:25.229
How odd.

40:26.965 --> 40:30.935
You actually know...

40:30.936 --> 40:34.972
the me who I really want to be.

40:37.943 --> 40:40.611
So...

40:40.612 --> 40:42.646
what do you think

40:42.647 --> 40:45.716
he would say to you right now?

40:48.587 --> 40:50.788
That's what I thought.

40:50.789 --> 40:52.089
No!

40:59.965 --> 41:01.465
Agent Thom...

41:01.466 --> 41:02.466
No.

41:02.467 --> 41:04.168
Oh, my God.

41:04.169 --> 41:07.838
Well, I did not see that coming.

41:07.839 --> 41:09.273
Oh, no.

41:10.976 --> 41:14.545
I can feel it.

41:14.546 --> 41:17.314
The blood.

41:17.315 --> 41:19.717
The fear.

41:19.718 --> 41:21.819
The slaughter.

41:24.556 --> 41:26.156
The thrill of it.

41:29.761 --> 41:31.929
Armies clashing.

41:34.900 --> 41:37.001
Striving for conquest.

41:44.409 --> 41:47.845
I am become...

41:49.614 --> 41:51.715
...war.
