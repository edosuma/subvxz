00:38.080 --> 00:42.960
Well, all right. Look at all that
beautiful, white stuff come down.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.295
Christmas is right around the corner

00:45.462 --> 00:47.673
and Chanukah starts tonight.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.299
Ain't a better time of year.

00:49.466 --> 00:54.179
You got no school, you can eat
like a pig and people give you stuff.

00:54.388 --> 00:57.099
Just makes you feel tingly all over.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.184
But you know what?

00:59.393 --> 01:03.188
There are some buffoons out there who
actually can't stand the holiday season.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.774
And seeing other people
enjoy the festivities

01:05.983 --> 01:07.484
gets them even more disgusted.

01:08.861 --> 01:11.071
In fact, the head honcho of holiday
humbug

01:11.280 --> 01:14.992
lives right here in little old Dukesberry.
His name's Davey Stone.

01:15.158 --> 01:17.494
That fool's in the China Dragon

01:17.661 --> 01:21.164
coming up with his own way
of feeling tingly all over.

01:23.292 --> 01:27.379
Four scorpion bowl in five minute?
That's got to be a restaurant record.

01:27.796 --> 01:32.676
Well, right now I'm going to go for
another restaurant record: longest burp.

01:43.562 --> 01:48.567
Congratulations. Now, please excuse me
while I go take shower.

01:49.193 --> 01:52.362
At one time, Davey was a super student,
super athlete

01:52.696 --> 01:56.366
super sweet, super kid and the apple
of his parents' eye.

01:58.577 --> 02:02.372
Now, he's just a 33-year-old,
crazy Jewish guy

02:02.581 --> 02:06.084
who lives for making this town
as miserable as he is

02:06.293 --> 02:08.669
especially on the first night
of Chanukah.

02:08.878 --> 02:11.673
How'd he end up this way?
Let's save that for later

02:11.882 --> 02:16.595
because right now, Davey's about to
get himself into some serious trouble.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.894
Hope you're not planning on driving
tonight, Stone.

02:24.061 --> 02:27.898
No, officer. I'm just going to say
good night to my car

02:28.065 --> 02:31.860
then walk home and enjoy
the holiday decorations.

02:32.194 --> 02:36.073
Listen, sweetheart. I have to leave you
here alone tonight

02:36.198 --> 02:40.077
but don't you worry, I'll be back
first thing in the morning.

02:40.285 --> 02:44.289
Now, behave yourself,
and don't stay up too late.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.875
Nighty-night.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.880
All right, baby. But let's make this quick.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.882
Oh, mama!

02:54.091 --> 02:56.260
You like it when I hold you like this?

02:56.468 --> 02:59.596
Because I'll do it all night long.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.183
So sweet.

03:04.268 --> 03:06.770
Yes, so precious.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.774
I love you, car.

03:10.899 --> 03:15.487
He dine and dash me! He chew and
screw me! He sip and skip me!

03:15.696 --> 03:18.574
What?
He no pay for his four scorpion bowl.

03:18.782 --> 03:19.992
Oh, boy.

03:21.994 --> 03:23.078
Get him.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.085
Come back here, you jerk!

03:32.880 --> 03:34.464
Somebody stop that guy!

03:34.882 --> 03:37.759
I'm the kind of guy who can't stand
A holiday

03:37.968 --> 03:41.972
So I drink them all away, that's me

03:42.181 --> 03:45.475
I don't decorate no trees

03:45.684 --> 03:49.188
And I won't eat no potato latkes

03:49.396 --> 03:53.984
But I'll give this old lady's melons
A squeeze

03:54.193 --> 03:56.778
That's just who I am

04:02.868 --> 04:05.996
Well, I'll never spin a dreidel,
But I'll always throw an egg

04:06.163 --> 04:10.292
And I'll charley horse your leg for laughs

04:10.959 --> 04:13.962
While you're singing your holiday tunes

04:14.171 --> 04:17.798
I'm acting like the town buffoon

04:17.966 --> 04:21.887
Whipping out my big, white, scary moon

04:22.095 --> 04:25.474
And blowing a beef your way

04:25.682 --> 04:29.186
I hate folks who think reindeer are cute

04:29.394 --> 04:32.397
To me they're just something to shoot

04:33.065 --> 04:34.691
I hate love

04:34.900 --> 04:36.693
I hate you

04:36.860 --> 04:38.779
I hate me

04:40.697 --> 04:42.574
Well, I'm a snowmobile-stealing

04:42.783 --> 04:47.579
No 'tis-the-season-feeling kind of guy

04:48.372 --> 04:52.084
This time of year sucks
So I take my nunchaks

04:52.292 --> 04:56.171
And make sure every snowman dies

04:56.380 --> 04:59.675
Believing in Santa's all wrong

05:00.259 --> 05:03.679
And Chanukah's eight nights too long

05:04.096 --> 05:05.180
I hate love

05:05.389 --> 05:06.890
I hate you

05:07.182 --> 05:09.059
I hate me

05:09.268 --> 05:10.394
Coming through.

05:10.561 --> 05:11.687
I hate love

05:11.895 --> 05:13.564
I hate you

05:13.689 --> 05:14.898
I hate me

05:15.065 --> 05:18.193
Davey Stone, you're nothing
but a delinquent!

05:19.278 --> 05:21.989
Stone, what the heck are we
going to do with you?

05:22.197 --> 05:26.660
I've sent you to reform school, the drunk
tank, the local psychiatric ward.

05:26.869 --> 05:30.372
Not one of those places has made you
change an ounce for the better.

05:30.581 --> 05:32.291
You used to be a good kid

05:32.499 --> 05:37.379
playing ball for the Jewish Community
Center, with the best shot ever seen.

05:37.588 --> 05:41.383
Your Honor, I still got a pretty good
jump shot. Let me show you.

05:44.386 --> 05:47.264
I'd hit a 3-pointer, but I'd
have to drop my pants

05:47.472 --> 05:49.600
and pop a thumb up my boo-boo.

05:49.766 --> 05:54.271
You leave me no choice. I'll really
have to crack down hard this time.

05:54.479 --> 05:59.568
Your Honor, if it pleases the court,
I'd like to interject for a moment.

05:59.776 --> 06:03.989
What the hell was that? Did anybody
hear a parakeet, or am I going crazy?

06:04.198 --> 06:07.659
No, Mr. Chang. It's me, Whitey Duvall.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.871
And a happy first night of Chanukah
to you.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.581
I'm not Jewish.

06:12.789 --> 06:17.169
Neither am I, but that don't stop me
from enjoying a holiday.

06:17.669 --> 06:20.797
Whitey, we went over this
two months ago.

06:20.964 --> 06:24.259
It's your last year of reffing
the youth league basketball.

06:24.468 --> 06:25.969
You're turning 70 years old

06:26.178 --> 06:29.681
and our insurance company says
they won't cover you anymore.

06:29.765 --> 06:30.891
No, no, no.

06:31.099 --> 06:35.896
My interjection pertains to the case
currently under adjudication.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.565
You see, I knew this young man
years ago

06:38.774 --> 06:41.568
when his moral fiber was still intact.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.278
What are you getting at?

06:43.570 --> 06:47.991
Why not sentence him to be a
referee-in-training for youth basketball?

06:48.283 --> 06:51.995
I've seen some pretty rowdy kids
turn into perfect gentlemen

06:52.162 --> 06:54.665
after spending time on my court.

06:54.873 --> 06:57.376
If that happened with Stone,
it would be a miracle.

06:57.584 --> 07:02.172
It's the holidays. Things like that have
been known to happen this time of year.

07:03.674 --> 07:07.177
Whitey, if you want to work with
this punk, then God bless you.

07:07.386 --> 07:10.264
But Mr. Stone, what Whitey says goes.

07:10.472 --> 07:12.391
And if I hear that you break one law

07:12.599 --> 07:17.062
I'll send you to the state
penitentiary for no less than 10 years.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.190
Happy holidays.

07:21.984 --> 07:23.193
Oh, God.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.988
The short man who's kind
and the donkey's behind.

07:26.196 --> 07:30.284
What a bizarre matchup.
Good luck, Whitey. You'll need it.

07:31.159 --> 07:34.496
Okay, let's give the little guy
some support.

07:37.166 --> 07:40.669
Did I just see two Persian cats
on your ass?

07:40.878 --> 07:45.299
I think I'm going to barf.

07:46.383 --> 07:49.261
Your horn works, try the lights.

07:51.889 --> 07:53.473
Okay.

07:53.765 --> 07:56.977
One. Two.

07:57.186 --> 07:59.271
Good to see you still got circus feet.

07:59.479 --> 08:03.567
Men's 11 right foot, children's
9 left foot

08:03.775 --> 08:05.194
at your service.

08:05.694 --> 08:06.778
Yuck.

08:07.196 --> 08:10.699
Now, I assume you've done
your pre-game stretching.

08:10.866 --> 08:12.576
No, let me do it right now.

08:12.784 --> 08:15.078
One. Two. Three.

08:15.287 --> 08:17.372
Four. Five. Six.

08:17.581 --> 08:20.459
Okay. That's good, but don't forget
your hammies.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.879
Of course Whitey wouldn't understand
what getting flipped off means.

08:24.087 --> 08:27.090
He's so behind the times,
he thinks Viagra's a big waterfall.

08:28.467 --> 08:30.093
But there is one thing he knows.

08:30.260 --> 08:33.679
The voting has begun for the highest
honor anyone in town could receive.

08:35.974 --> 08:38.684
I think it's gonna be your year, Whitey.
I really do.

08:40.187 --> 08:45.067
Whoa. Don't even think of coming
on this floor with those hard soles, pally.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.277
Fine, I'll just ref in my socks.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.283
Must be game time.

08:54.576 --> 08:57.579
Don't let him push your buttons, Whitey.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.062
What are you waiting for?

09:22.271 --> 09:24.273
Come on. Dribble!
Hurry up!

09:29.278 --> 09:32.072
What, no whistle on that one, ref?

09:32.281 --> 09:33.490
Okay.

09:34.491 --> 09:38.161
Foul on this kid for eating
everything in sight.

09:38.495 --> 09:42.791
Jelly jugs, next time you come on
my court, you better wear a bra. Okay?

09:44.585 --> 09:48.797
He was just kidding, son.
You've got very nice boobs.

09:49.464 --> 09:50.591
Jerk!
Idiot!

09:50.799 --> 09:54.678
You don't like that? How about you
throw something at me. I dare you.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.680
With pleasure!

09:57.181 --> 10:01.768
They're scratching up my floor.
Here comes a seizure.

10:03.395 --> 10:06.690
This will pass in a second, kids.

10:06.899 --> 10:08.358
Don't be scared.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.068
Is he break dancing?

10:12.196 --> 10:15.991
Okay, that's it. Game over.
Nobody wants to see an old man die.

10:16.200 --> 10:19.369
Fatty's team loses because
I want to see him cry again.

10:22.164 --> 10:25.876
I want to talk to you in my office.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.796
Why the hell are we at the mall?

10:29.963 --> 10:32.090
You need to clean your brain out.

10:32.299 --> 10:35.594
And to me, the mall is the best place
to do that.

10:35.886 --> 10:37.387
What's good about this place?

10:37.596 --> 10:41.475
What's good about it? Everything.
You want a pair of socks?

10:41.683 --> 10:44.895
My buddy, Mr. Foot Locker,
will warm your feet.

10:45.062 --> 10:46.772
You need a fancy doodad?

10:46.980 --> 10:52.277
Hello, Sharper Image. Thanks for the
combination pogo sticklclock radio.

10:52.486 --> 10:55.072
I mean, The Body Shop, the Tie Rack

10:55.197 --> 10:57.074
GNC, RadioShack

10:57.282 --> 11:01.662
Petland for a cat or two,
Spencer's Gifts for some fake dog doo

11:01.870 --> 11:04.581
Sbarro's, Dunkin' Donuts,
they're simply the best.

11:04.873 --> 11:07.793
And don't forget the orange
chicken at Panda Express.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.462
But if you're short of cash
like little old me

11:10.671 --> 11:13.382
the window shopping's always free.

11:14.091 --> 11:18.470
Did you prepare that or did you rhyme
that many times in a row by accident?

11:19.179 --> 11:21.390
Yeah, that was weird, wasn't it?

11:21.598 --> 11:23.100
Maybe you are a leprechaun.

11:23.267 --> 11:25.978
Let's just get some snacks and chat.
Okay?

11:27.896 --> 11:29.690
Aren't you a boy?

11:33.277 --> 11:35.362
Now, I'd like to make this work out.

11:35.571 --> 11:38.782
But in order to do so, you're
going to have to learn

11:38.866 --> 11:43.579
that youth basketball ain't about you
and your lack of respect for others.

11:43.871 --> 11:49.084
It's about the kids and teaching them
responsibility and teamwork.

11:49.293 --> 11:52.462
I've been doing my part for 35 years.

11:52.671 --> 11:55.591
Are you ready to join me, big guy?

12:01.471 --> 12:05.893
Joke's on you, tough guy. I can't read.

12:06.059 --> 12:09.771
Special delivery for Whitey Duvall,
sugar-free doughnuts.

12:09.980 --> 12:13.692
Every day she does this for me.
Jennifer, you're too much.

12:13.859 --> 12:16.778
My fraternal twin sister's a diabetic

12:16.987 --> 12:21.575
and out of respect for her and her
disease, I don't eat sugar products.

12:21.783 --> 12:24.494
There's a surprise in there you'll like.

12:24.661 --> 12:28.373
Don't tell me it's Bavarian cream-filled.

12:29.291 --> 12:31.376
It is Bavarian cream-filled!

12:31.585 --> 12:32.878
Hubba-bubba!

12:33.086 --> 12:38.383
These babies make my taste buds
do double daffies, for gosh sakes.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.677
Why are you hiding over there?

12:40.886 --> 12:42.971
It's okay, sweetheart. Talk to Whitey.

12:43.180 --> 12:45.974
Hi, Whitey. I got another Chanukah
present tonight.

12:46.183 --> 12:50.187
Wow, Benjamin, an Etch A Sketch.
Not too shabby.

12:50.395 --> 12:52.064
That's a Game Boy, you idiot.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.192
Sorry, I'm not up
on modern technology.

12:55.359 --> 12:59.863
But I guess my friend Davey is.
Why don't you tell him what else you got.

12:59.988 --> 13:02.491
First night, I got a basketball
and some dreidels.

13:02.699 --> 13:05.494
Night two, I got a pup tent for camping
in the backyard.

13:05.661 --> 13:07.371
And tonight, I got this.

13:07.579 --> 13:12.584
Wow. Maybe on night four the Chanukah
monster will take a big crap on your bed.

13:13.877 --> 13:16.171
Thanks for sharing the holiday spirit,
psycho.

13:16.380 --> 13:18.882
Come and help me
clean the muffin trays.

13:19.091 --> 13:21.969
Bye, Whitey.
See you at the game tomorrow.

13:23.262 --> 13:27.182
Your girlfriend's backyard
isn't sugar-free. That baby looks sweet.

13:27.391 --> 13:30.060
Technical foul! Technical foul!

13:30.185 --> 13:33.480
That's a lady, and you will not
speak about her that way!

13:33.689 --> 13:34.690
Easy.

13:34.898 --> 13:37.359
She's going through a tough time now.

13:37.568 --> 13:41.363
Last spring, her husband of 13 years
ups and leaves her

13:41.572 --> 13:44.199
for a woman he met on the computer.

13:44.366 --> 13:49.663
She had the courage to move back a
month ago to try and raise her boy alone.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.498
So she's available?

13:51.665 --> 13:55.460
You wish, mac. You blew your shot
with her 20 years ago.

13:55.669 --> 13:56.962
Twenty years?

13:57.171 --> 13:58.964
Was that Jennifer Friedman?

13:59.298 --> 14:02.885
I'm surprised you have enough
brain cells left to remember.

14:05.095 --> 14:09.266
Hey, Jennifer, you still coming over to
watch 'Dukes of Hazzard' after the game?

14:09.391 --> 14:10.767
That's a big 10-4, Davey.

14:10.976 --> 14:11.977
Hey, Davey.

14:12.186 --> 14:14.563
Smile! Your mom wants to take a picture.

14:15.689 --> 14:16.773
Thanks, honey.

14:17.065 --> 14:19.776
If my parents fall asleep early,
I'll show you my basement.

14:20.068 --> 14:21.570
Keep dreaming.

14:22.779 --> 14:26.366
They make a nice couple
boogie-oogie-oogies.

14:27.659 --> 14:30.078
I don't know when you were goofier,
then or now.

14:30.287 --> 14:34.666
Good evening, Mayor Stuey Duhy.
Out for some late-night shopping?

14:34.875 --> 14:38.962
Yeah. Then I have to figure out how to
rebuild our giant menorah and Santa.

14:39.087 --> 14:41.465
Thanks for ruining the ice pageant again,
Stone.

14:41.673 --> 14:44.176
I didn't do it for you.
I did it for the ladies.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.469
Yeah, right.

14:46.595 --> 14:51.767
Has there been talk about who the lucky
patch recipient may be this year or?

14:51.975 --> 14:55.687
That's up to who the town votes for.
Could be you or me or anybody.

14:55.979 --> 14:58.273
All right, I'm going to get going now.

14:58.482 --> 15:00.692
Happy holidays, your excellence.

15:00.859 --> 15:04.488
Good night, mayor! And the answer
to your question is Spencer's Gifts.

15:04.696 --> 15:08.200
They definitely have furry underwear.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.286
You're gross.

15:12.496 --> 15:16.083
Is it just me, or did you notice
when he said, "It could be you"

15:16.291 --> 15:19.169
there was a certain sincerity
in his voice, or?

15:19.378 --> 15:21.964
You actually give a crap
about winning a patch?

15:22.172 --> 15:27.094
It's only the most prestigious award
given out at the all-star banquet.

15:27.261 --> 15:29.179
Can you imagine?

15:29.596 --> 15:33.183
Won't you dance with me

15:33.267 --> 15:36.979
At the annual all-star banquet?

15:37.896 --> 15:41.692
We'll be so fancy-free

15:41.859 --> 15:45.988
At the annual all-star banquet

15:46.488 --> 15:50.576
Everyone in town will be looking
Their best

15:50.784 --> 15:54.371
Even Mrs. Selman with her one
Extra breast

15:54.580 --> 15:58.458
It's the kind of a night when your
Feet match

15:58.667 --> 16:03.380
When you feel nearly 5-foot-3!

16:03.589 --> 16:07.593
They'll laugh and they'll dance
And they'll pee in their pants

16:07.759 --> 16:12.890
'Cause there's a patch at the
All-star banquet waiting for me

16:13.599 --> 16:15.893
Can you take me home now?

16:19.271 --> 16:22.900
Well, that was nice of Davey to snap
Whitey out of his little dream.

16:23.066 --> 16:26.862
All that song was saying was
the patch means the world to Whitey.

16:27.070 --> 16:29.489
He'd rather be remembered
for his hard work

16:29.698 --> 16:32.993
not for the fact that he had the
hairiest buns in the locker room.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.578
Can you blame him?

16:38.665 --> 16:40.959
How's that peanut brittle?

16:41.293 --> 16:43.879
Crunchy and delicious.

16:45.589 --> 16:50.677
Funny, I don't remember Denise
or Janice ringing up a purchase for you.

16:50.886 --> 16:53.263
I guess that means I stole it.

16:57.476 --> 16:59.770
Easy, seizure-boy!

17:00.187 --> 17:02.689
That's it. I'm calling the judge.

17:02.898 --> 17:06.859
Go ahead. I'll be on the first bus out.
I ain't spending 10 years in prison.

17:07.069 --> 17:08.987
Maybe I'll just take you in myself.

17:09.195 --> 17:12.574
Don't think you can intimidate me
just because of my size.

17:12.782 --> 17:16.078
Why? You're smaller than me?
I didn't notice that.

17:16.578 --> 17:18.997
Put me down! Put me down!

17:19.164 --> 17:21.290
And get out of my car right now!

17:21.500 --> 17:26.588
Oh, no. You're going to make me walk
10 feet? That's where I live, idiot!

17:27.964 --> 17:29.466
Thanks for the ride, patchy.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.969
It was great patching with you.

17:32.177 --> 17:34.680
And I guess I'll patch you later.

17:37.599 --> 17:39.476
I'm letting this one go, Stone.

17:39.768 --> 17:43.564
But next screwup, it's slammer time.

17:54.867 --> 17:57.995
Got any sand or rock salt in there?

17:58.162 --> 18:00.080
I need to get some traction.

18:00.289 --> 18:04.376
"Got any sand or rock salt in there?
'Cause I need to get some-"

18:04.668 --> 18:06.795
Oh, shut up!

18:08.088 --> 18:11.383
He could've at least given me a push
or something.

18:29.568 --> 18:33.488
closing, channel 36 would
like to wish all of its Jewish viewers

18:33.697 --> 18:36.074
the very happiest of Chanukahs.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.160
Boo!

19:00.599 --> 19:01.600
Hey!

19:03.185 --> 19:04.561
A little help, fellas?

19:13.862 --> 19:17.491
One. Two. Three!

19:18.075 --> 19:20.577
Have a holly, jolly one, guys.

19:20.786 --> 19:22.371
Doesn't it make you feel good

19:22.663 --> 19:25.874
when you see a group of deer
helping a motorist in need?

19:26.083 --> 19:28.377
But I bet Whitey wishes they showed up
earlier

19:28.669 --> 19:31.880
because his sister, Eleanore,
gets a little edgy when he's late.

19:31.964 --> 19:33.882
Whitey, where were you?

19:33.966 --> 19:38.762
You're an hour and 51 minutes late.
I already called the morgue.

19:38.971 --> 19:42.266
They said you weren't there,
but to try back later.

19:42.683 --> 19:45.561
I had an interesting talk
with the mayor tonight.

19:45.769 --> 19:51.066
The mayor? Was it about the ruffians
who stole my Liz Taylor wig?

19:51.984 --> 19:53.986
Eleanore, that was 45 years ago.

19:54.278 --> 19:56.572
I'm still shaking from it.

19:56.989 --> 20:00.075
Anyways, the mayor seems to think
there's a chance

20:00.284 --> 20:02.494
I might receive the patch this year.

20:02.786 --> 20:06.582
Oh, boy. Let's just soak our feet, brother.

20:06.999 --> 20:10.085
First position. Second position.

20:13.088 --> 20:14.798
See you later, smell.

20:14.965 --> 20:18.260
Just don't get your hopes up too high
about the patch.

20:18.468 --> 20:21.763
I can handle myself,
Eleanore. Trust me.

20:43.994 --> 20:47.789
When you have enough lights to make
your house look like the Vegas Strip

20:47.998 --> 20:50.375
you'll have a big electric bill.

20:50.584 --> 20:52.961
And being a volunteer referee
for the youth basketball league

20:53.086 --> 20:56.590
doesn't exactly get you
in the Fortune 500.

20:57.090 --> 21:01.470
So old Whitey's up early every day,
searching the town for odd jobs

21:01.762 --> 21:04.473
to help make ends meet
for him and Eleanore.

21:05.474 --> 21:06.975
How's that, fellas?!

21:07.184 --> 21:09.686
It's crooked, shorty. Move it to the right.

21:09.895 --> 21:10.896
You got it.

21:11.897 --> 21:12.981
Whoops.

21:21.073 --> 21:25.077
Well, will you look at that.
It's a jackass-in-the-box.

21:27.079 --> 21:29.164
Let's go get some coffee.

21:29.373 --> 21:32.459
Anything else I can do for you guys?

21:32.668 --> 21:35.879
If you clean out the crappers,
I'll give you a buck.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.383
Consider it done.
Nice doing business with you.

21:58.777 --> 22:01.363
That's what happens
when you hit the bottle.

22:01.572 --> 22:05.576
You go to sleep in Dukesberry,
you wake up in Pukesberry.

22:05.784 --> 22:07.161
Pukesberry.

22:07.286 --> 22:09.371
Hey. What are you do..? No!

22:22.176 --> 22:27.181
The worst has happened.
I'm covered in human feces.

22:27.764 --> 22:32.561
That's a good look for you. But for
health reasons, I should spray you off.

22:39.276 --> 22:41.570
Smell you later, poopsicle.

22:44.698 --> 22:47.284
You're a fricking degenerate.

22:47.493 --> 22:49.077
I know I am.

23:02.466 --> 23:04.384
A little help, please.

23:15.062 --> 23:16.980
Your tongues tickle.

23:17.189 --> 23:18.899
They tickle.

23:20.275 --> 23:22.569
You are right. That was gross.

23:23.570 --> 23:26.573
Thumbelina, there's no kids playing.
Why'd you tell me to come?

23:26.782 --> 23:31.370
I thought you could use a refresher
course on b-ball rules and regulations.

23:31.578 --> 23:35.791
You're nuts. I'm going to pound a few.
First of all, you booze, you lose.

23:35.999 --> 23:38.460
And secondly, if you don't turn around

23:38.669 --> 23:43.966
Officer Sherman over there'll know of
the infamous peanut brittle incident.

23:44.967 --> 23:46.677
What's with the dunkin' munchkin?

23:46.885 --> 23:51.390
His mom had to do a double shift so I'm
watching him till she can get here.

23:51.682 --> 23:55.561
Now, both of you cop a squat
next to me and let's observe.

23:58.689 --> 24:00.065
Take it! Take it!

24:01.400 --> 24:02.776
Charging! Our ball.

24:02.860 --> 24:06.196
See, that wasn't a charge.
It was actually blocking.

24:06.363 --> 24:09.867
The defender didn't have both feet
planted in time.

24:10.075 --> 24:13.162
Oh, really? Because I thought
that was high-sticking.

24:13.871 --> 24:18.876
Don't encourage him, Benjamin. He's
upset because he can't play no more.

24:19.084 --> 24:23.463
Twenty years of drinking destroyed
the basketball lobe of his brain.

24:23.797 --> 24:27.176
I can whup any of those clowns
out there even with you as my partner.

24:27.384 --> 24:28.886
I'd like to see that.

24:29.178 --> 24:30.762
I'd like to see that right now.

24:31.096 --> 24:34.266
He was just kidding, fellas.
Whole lot of jibber jabber.

24:34.474 --> 24:37.060
We got no beef with you guys.

24:37.269 --> 24:41.982
Because if a midget and a drunk
can beat us, I'd eat my own jockstrap.

24:42.065 --> 24:44.484
No, he don't play ball anymore.

24:44.568 --> 24:48.488
I'll play. But if we win, you got
to eat that guy's jockstrap.

24:52.367 --> 24:54.786
First to five wins. We're shirts.

24:55.370 --> 24:59.082
Oh, boy. Does that mean we're skins?

25:01.960 --> 25:03.879
I don't see any skin, monkey-man.

25:04.671 --> 25:05.964
Just pass me the ball.

25:06.173 --> 25:07.799
All right, Fuzzy Wuzzy.

25:08.091 --> 25:12.262
All right, simmer down, Whitey.
Don't travel. Don't double dribble.

25:12.471 --> 25:15.098
I want a good, clean game
and no back talk.

25:15.265 --> 25:17.684
Orangutan, you're playing, not reffing.

25:18.060 --> 25:21.980
He's right. Look for your opening
and take it.

25:23.482 --> 25:24.483
There it is!

25:28.278 --> 25:30.697
Now set yourself and shoot.

25:34.284 --> 25:35.786
Oh, no.

25:37.371 --> 25:39.790
Are you finally dead, old man?

25:41.500 --> 25:45.379
I'll be over to feed the cats
in the morning

25:45.587 --> 25:47.965
Mrs. Addison.

25:49.299 --> 25:51.260
Okay, he's useless.

25:54.972 --> 25:56.473
One more thing.

25:58.559 --> 26:01.270
Good kitty. Nice kitty.

26:01.979 --> 26:03.897
Muffin boy, what's your real name?

26:03.981 --> 26:05.065
Benjamin.

26:05.274 --> 26:06.859
You're in. Let's go.

26:07.359 --> 26:09.862
You're trading in the midget for a spaz?

26:10.362 --> 26:12.072
This is going to be even sadder.

26:14.199 --> 26:16.160
We'll see. Your ball.

26:16.285 --> 26:17.369
Oops.

26:17.578 --> 26:18.662
I'm not very good.

26:18.871 --> 26:22.875
That's all right. Just try to stay
confident, and if I say shoot it, shoot it.

26:25.169 --> 26:26.879
Game on.

26:27.588 --> 26:29.882
He may be big, but he's ugly, Benny.

26:30.299 --> 26:31.383
Good luck, chump.

26:32.176 --> 26:34.178
I'll take that.
Hey!

26:36.597 --> 26:37.890
Put it up.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.185
Coming through!

26:41.393 --> 26:45.397
That's all right, just keep your
elbow in. Now stick it, kid.

26:46.899 --> 26:48.066
Yeah!

26:48.275 --> 26:51.695
Looks like you better start
showing the spaz some respect.

26:51.862 --> 26:53.572
Just keep playing.

26:59.369 --> 27:04.583
Where am I going, baby?
Where am I going? Oh, snap. Oh, snap.

27:04.791 --> 27:06.585
Trap him.
I'm on it.

27:08.170 --> 27:09.796
It's all you, buddy.

27:10.172 --> 27:13.300
I hope you all like your
jockstraps extra sweaty.

27:13.467 --> 27:15.761
One. Two.

27:16.678 --> 27:17.763
Three.

27:18.972 --> 27:21.099
You wanna win this or not?
Yeah.

27:21.391 --> 27:23.268
Well, then cover the nerd.

27:23.977 --> 27:25.771
The saga continues.

27:32.861 --> 27:35.072
Not this time, little man.

27:35.864 --> 27:38.283
Hey, look what I still got.

27:40.160 --> 27:42.162
Yeah, good coverage.

27:43.372 --> 27:44.790
What a shot.

27:44.873 --> 27:48.794
I call that the
top-of-the-key-eat-the-jockstrap shot.

27:56.969 --> 27:58.971
Hold it now. Hold it now.

28:00.180 --> 28:02.391
Where's it going now?

28:02.975 --> 28:04.768
How's he doing that?

28:05.269 --> 28:06.979
Oh, boy.

28:07.563 --> 28:08.897
Put it up, Ben.

28:10.482 --> 28:11.483
Got a piece!

28:11.692 --> 28:13.986
Bam! Got a piece of my ass.

28:14.987 --> 28:16.196
Shut up!

28:16.363 --> 28:19.199
One more basket and it's chow time,
boys.

28:27.875 --> 28:29.459
Let's bring it home.

28:30.460 --> 28:32.296
You're my boy, Benny.

28:40.179 --> 28:41.972
Whoa, little Iverson.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.977
Double up on Stone!
You got it!

28:47.394 --> 28:48.687
Put it up, Benny.

28:48.896 --> 28:49.980
What's happening?

28:50.898 --> 28:53.275
No!
Oh, Benny!

28:53.483 --> 28:54.985
You gotta be kidding me!

28:55.194 --> 28:56.195
Yeah!

28:57.196 --> 28:59.281
Now say what I told you to say.

28:59.573 --> 29:02.784
Eat that nut-strap, bitch!

29:03.285 --> 29:04.495
Benjamin!

29:07.581 --> 29:10.667
Don't ever use that kind of language
again. Do you hear me?

29:10.959 --> 29:12.169
I'm sorry.

29:12.461 --> 29:14.087
He's just having some fun.

29:14.379 --> 29:19.092
Cursing and acting like a jerk may be
your idea of fun, but it won't be his.

29:19.259 --> 29:21.762
One Davey Stone
around here is enough.

29:24.765 --> 29:27.267
My finger's in your mouth, kitty

29:27.559 --> 29:30.771
but I don't feel no teeth.

29:30.979 --> 29:32.564
Let's go, Benjamin.

29:35.776 --> 29:38.362
Why are you eating that?

29:40.989 --> 29:43.867
You know, my mother doesn't
like you very much.

29:44.076 --> 29:47.162
You know, I don't like me
very much either.

29:48.872 --> 29:50.582
Nice playing with you, mini-Shaq.

29:59.174 --> 30:01.176
Why was she looking at me like that?

30:01.760 --> 30:03.887
How could they let that guy
work with kids?

30:04.096 --> 30:06.181
Giving me those nasty eyes.

30:06.890 --> 30:08.392
I was being nice to her kid.

30:08.767 --> 30:10.978
They should have locked
him up for good.

30:11.186 --> 30:13.981
At least she was looking at me.
That felt all right.

30:14.565 --> 30:16.567
Why can't he just be like he used to be?

30:19.695 --> 30:22.781
It all seems so long ago

30:22.990 --> 30:26.076
Young and happy don't you know

30:26.285 --> 30:29.788
Down by the creek I would show

30:29.997 --> 30:33.000
Fireflies to that girl

30:33.083 --> 30:36.587
But that was back when he was nice

30:36.795 --> 30:40.174
Before my warm heart turned to ice

30:40.299 --> 30:43.760
My sister's wig once had lice

30:43.969 --> 30:47.264
But that was long ago

30:47.472 --> 30:51.059
The schoolyard's where we were

30:51.268 --> 30:53.770
The first time I kissed her

30:54.062 --> 30:56.690
He thought he got some tongue

30:56.899 --> 31:00.194
But it was only retainer

31:00.360 --> 31:03.071
Eleanore's bra is a trainer

31:03.363 --> 31:06.492
Well, over there's my family home

31:07.159 --> 31:10.162
And the woods we used to roam

31:10.370 --> 31:13.790
The only time I had
sex was on the phone

31:13.999 --> 31:15.459
But that was long ago

31:16.960 --> 31:18.462
I carved our names upon that tree

31:20.172 --> 31:23.300
I loved him and he loved me

31:23.467 --> 31:27.095
My darling wife was once a he

31:27.262 --> 31:30.265
But that was long ago

31:30.599 --> 31:33.477
He'd always whisper in my ear

31:33.685 --> 31:36.980
But then I started drinking beer

31:37.189 --> 31:42.486
My jewels got licked by six frisky deer

31:44.363 --> 31:48.492
Now he's just a loner and a liar

31:48.659 --> 31:51.495
And my trailer's caught on fire

31:51.662 --> 31:52.663
Fire?!

31:56.959 --> 31:58.168
Oh, my God!

31:58.877 --> 32:00.671
Be careful!

32:16.395 --> 32:18.188
Maybe it's some kind of sign.

32:18.397 --> 32:21.859
After all, Chanukah is
the festival of lights.

32:22.276 --> 32:25.195
I should stick you on
a twig and roast you.

32:25.362 --> 32:29.366
Just get back in my car. You'll stay
with me and my sister for a while.

32:29.700 --> 32:31.285
I ain't living with you buffoons.

32:31.493 --> 32:35.080
What other options do you got, Mr.
Rockefeller?

32:45.674 --> 32:48.385
Hello?
Hi, is Ophelia there?

32:48.677 --> 32:52.181
Ophelia who?
Ophelia Hiney.

32:52.389 --> 32:54.975
Oh, feel my hiney?

32:55.559 --> 33:00.689
You hoodlums better bring my
wig back! I know it was you!

33:12.659 --> 33:15.579
It's a home-invasion robbery!

33:15.787 --> 33:20.876
Take whatever you want, but please
don't chop my legs off!

33:21.084 --> 33:23.295
It's okay, Eleanore, it's okay.

33:23.587 --> 33:27.966
Whitey, thank God you're here. We're
being robbed by a lunatic.

33:28.300 --> 33:31.470
Mister, if you're going to kill us, take
off your wet shoes.

33:31.678 --> 33:33.972
They're soaking the carpet.

33:35.599 --> 33:38.060
Eleanore, that's Davey Stone, my new
partner.

33:38.268 --> 33:43.398
The criminal?! Did he force you to
bring him here so he could molest you?

33:45.484 --> 33:49.988
His home just went up in flames. So I
invited him to stay with us for a while.

33:54.284 --> 33:57.496
Okay, but I'm making an inventory

33:57.663 --> 34:00.499
of every single item in this house.

34:00.791 --> 34:01.792
Fascinating.

34:01.959 --> 34:07.089
Look! He already stole something.
He's hiding it in his jacket.

34:07.297 --> 34:09.800
I didn't steal this.
It's a card my parents gave me.

34:09.967 --> 34:12.761
So why don't you go stay with them?

34:12.886 --> 34:13.971
They died.

34:14.179 --> 34:15.681
My bad.

34:16.681 --> 34:19.893
Here's to you guys for letting me
crash over.

34:20.686 --> 34:24.982
Alcohol in our house?
This is never going to work.

34:25.274 --> 34:30.070
It will. We just need to set some rules
so Davey knows how we do things here.

34:30.362 --> 34:32.072
I'm scared.

34:32.281 --> 34:36.659
Look. You gotta understand it's just
been me and Eleanore for 67 years

34:36.869 --> 34:39.163
so she gets nervous around
strangers.

34:39.371 --> 34:41.373
I wouldn't show that picture to anyone

34:41.581 --> 34:44.293
or they may try to take you two back
to the laboratory.

34:44.668 --> 34:46.795
Listen. We got rules in this house

34:46.962 --> 34:50.382
and you better follow them or you'll
find yourself out of here.

34:52.592 --> 34:54.678
This might be harder than I thought.

34:55.888 --> 34:59.766
If you're coming from the street
With dirty shoes on your feet

34:59.975 --> 35:01.768
That's a technical foul

35:03.562 --> 35:06.899
If you switch the radio to some
"Modern" music show

35:07.065 --> 35:09.359
That's a technical foul

35:11.570 --> 35:14.490
If you don't shut the door

35:14.698 --> 35:17.993
After using the 'frigerator

35:18.076 --> 35:21.079
That's a technical foul

35:21.288 --> 35:24.791
A technical foul

35:25.584 --> 35:27.377
If you touch the thermostat

35:27.586 --> 35:28.962
You'll get hit with a bat

35:29.087 --> 35:30.964
'Cause that's a technical foul

35:31.173 --> 35:32.883
You will feel my wrath

35:33.091 --> 35:36.386
If your hair clogs the drain
You'll know the meaning of pain

35:36.595 --> 35:38.388
'Cause that's a technical foul

35:38.597 --> 35:40.682
I'll show you no mercy

35:40.891 --> 35:43.477
Ho! This is such bullshit

35:44.186 --> 35:47.397
In this house we say "bullspit"

35:47.689 --> 35:50.567
Or it's a technical foul

35:50.859 --> 35:52.361
A technical foul

35:52.569 --> 35:56.365
Let me get this straight. You expect me
to change my lifestyle in one night

35:56.490 --> 35:59.493
because you guys are a couple of
psychotic control freaks?

35:59.576 --> 36:02.162
You got it, bub.
Or you can go rot in the gutter.

36:02.371 --> 36:05.165
It's up to you, Yankee Doodle.
I don't want to do that

36:05.374 --> 36:08.877
but let me run a few questions by you
so I don't screw up accidentally.

36:10.170 --> 36:13.590
If I don't spray Lysol
After moving a bowel?

36:13.799 --> 36:15.676
That's a technical foul

36:17.177 --> 36:21.098
If I decide to wash my ass
With your monogrammed towel?

36:21.265 --> 36:24.184
That's a technical foul
Please, say "hiney."

36:24.977 --> 36:28.480
If I make fun of your crazy feeties

36:28.772 --> 36:31.692
Or give sugar cookies to Miss Diabetes

36:31.859 --> 36:33.986
That's not only a technical foul

36:35.279 --> 36:37.865
But possibly a homicide

36:41.160 --> 36:43.078
Can I sleep past 3?

36:43.287 --> 36:44.997
If you do, you'll get a T

36:45.164 --> 36:48.584
Take a whiz in those flowers?
I'll say, "Hit the showers"

36:48.792 --> 36:52.087
Use this horn as a bong?
Adiós, Tommy Chong

36:52.171 --> 36:53.881
Make some long-distance calls?

36:54.089 --> 36:56.758
You'll get a kick in the balls
Oops!

36:56.967 --> 37:00.095
Can I walk around with
My morning erection?

37:00.262 --> 37:03.390
If you want an automatic ejection

37:03.599 --> 37:06.268
'Cause that's a technical foul

37:06.476 --> 37:09.479
But I'd like to see it anyway

37:10.564 --> 37:12.191
Just kidding.

37:12.983 --> 37:16.487
There are certain rules
Which apply in one's life

37:16.695 --> 37:20.282
With your sister, friends
Or imaginary wife

37:20.574 --> 37:24.077
I can't believe I haven't killed myself

37:24.369 --> 37:28.373
Here with Wigs McGee and the furry elf

37:28.582 --> 37:31.668
They took my wig

37:31.960 --> 37:35.964
I remember the look in their eyes

37:36.173 --> 37:39.384
I guess I'll have to deal
With your demands

37:39.593 --> 37:43.472
But please don't touch me
With your alien hands

37:43.680 --> 37:47.267
I got no right to growl

37:47.476 --> 37:50.062
The whistle, she's on the prowl

37:50.687 --> 37:54.775
Without my wig, I look like an owl
Hoo! Hoo!

37:55.067 --> 37:56.777
Oh, my God.
Don't laugh at her.

37:56.985 --> 38:00.864
Or it's a technical foul

38:01.073 --> 38:05.869
A technical foul

38:15.587 --> 38:17.673
Davey will have to make the best of this.

38:17.965 --> 38:21.385
I guess I got to make the best of this.
See. I told you.

38:22.594 --> 38:26.682
But that shouldn't be too hard for him.
Even loners need company sometimes.

38:28.684 --> 38:30.477
Shaving the chest.

38:30.686 --> 38:33.897
Nobody needs a uni-brow.

38:35.774 --> 38:37.776
This is going to scare her silly.

38:37.985 --> 38:39.194
Yeah, it is.

38:39.361 --> 38:41.780
Peanuts for me?

38:52.499 --> 38:56.670
Wish we were taller, Eleanore?
I can't reach the cobwebs.

38:57.588 --> 39:00.174
Thank you, Davey.
No problem, Eleanore.

39:10.267 --> 39:12.186
Good one, Eleanore.

39:14.396 --> 39:17.065
Here you go.
Thanks. Have a good day.

39:22.571 --> 39:24.364
Good luck, old man.

39:26.658 --> 39:31.288
Now I can understand wrapping
the cornmeal around the hot dog

39:31.497 --> 39:34.291
but why the heck would they shove
this stick in here?

39:34.500 --> 39:37.794
I'm getting exhausted
trying to cut around it.

39:38.086 --> 39:41.590
You're supposed to hold the stick
and just eat the corn dog off of it.

39:42.174 --> 39:44.968
How futuristic.

39:45.177 --> 39:46.595
Oh, my God.

39:47.179 --> 39:50.599
Zip up or you'll catch a throat cold.

39:50.766 --> 39:52.559
Thank you.

39:54.561 --> 39:55.979
Hey, Benny!

39:56.063 --> 39:59.483
Nice game against Saint Catherine's
today. How many buckets you score?

39:59.566 --> 40:00.692
Fourteen.

40:00.776 --> 40:02.986
You're gonna be league-high scorer, kid.

40:03.779 --> 40:05.572
You just got to keep your elbows in.

40:05.781 --> 40:07.491
That's my man.

40:16.291 --> 40:19.294
Hey, you two, just doing circles.

40:22.172 --> 40:23.674
Oopsy-doodle!

40:26.677 --> 40:28.387
Yeah!

40:28.595 --> 40:30.180
I haven't done that in a while.

40:30.389 --> 40:34.977
Maybe I'm so excited about the banquet
tonight, it's giving me extra oomph.

40:35.269 --> 40:40.274
You'll extra-oomph yourself right into
another seizure if you don't calm down.

40:40.482 --> 40:43.777
He'll be all right. How'd you get
so good on the ice, anyways?

40:43.986 --> 40:47.573
In the '50s I reffed youth hockey
for a couple of seasons.

40:47.781 --> 40:51.285
Until a wrist shot caught him in the
back of the skull.

40:51.493 --> 40:54.371
Nothing a little metal plate couldn't fix.

40:54.663 --> 40:56.790
He was in a coma for three months.

40:56.999 --> 40:59.168
I needed the rest anyway.

41:03.672 --> 41:05.591
Could I get a lift from you, partner?

41:05.674 --> 41:06.758
Sure.

41:10.387 --> 41:14.099
So, Davey, did you play the hockey
when you were a child?

41:14.266 --> 41:16.268
No, hockey players get up too early.

41:16.560 --> 41:20.564
This guy's sport always was and
always will be basketball.

41:20.772 --> 41:22.191
Back in '81

41:22.399 --> 41:25.777
he was the star of what is still
known to this very day

41:25.986 --> 41:28.572
as the JCC miracle game.

41:28.864 --> 41:29.865
Oh, my.

41:30.073 --> 41:32.659
The JCC was down by 24 points.

41:32.993 --> 41:35.787
The bad news is we stand no chance
of winning this game.

41:36.079 --> 41:40.083
The good news is it's Chanukah, so
you'll all get presents tonight anyway.

41:40.292 --> 41:41.877
Speaking of presents

41:42.085 --> 41:45.464
our parents come to all our games
even though we always lose.

41:45.672 --> 41:46.965
So I was thinking

41:47.174 --> 41:51.094
maybe tonight we could try to win one
for them. You know, as a gift.

41:51.261 --> 41:54.681
The only way that'll happen is if you
take all the shots.

41:54.973 --> 41:56.683
Well, if you guys don't mind

41:56.892 --> 41:59.269
It's okay with us.
Go for it. You got it.

41:59.561 --> 42:01.063
Let's win!

42:01.271 --> 42:02.981
Where are your parents, anyways?

42:04.983 --> 42:08.070
I don't know. Hopefully, out
getting me an Atari.

42:16.995 --> 42:18.288
All right, Davey!

42:34.972 --> 42:36.473
Come on!
Let's go!

42:39.268 --> 42:40.394
We'll take that.

42:43.689 --> 42:45.274
Not today.

42:51.864 --> 42:55.993
That kind of shooting makes me
want to do the robot dance.

43:06.295 --> 43:07.671
Nice story. You can stop now.

43:07.880 --> 43:11.383
No, no, go on. Whitey, I'm mesmerized.

43:11.592 --> 43:13.260
Can we just go? I'm cold.

43:13.468 --> 43:17.389
I want to hear what happens next.
It's like a fairy tale.

43:17.598 --> 43:22.477
Unfortunately, this fairy tale
doesn't have a happy ending.

43:35.866 --> 43:38.869
Davey was wondering
where his parents were.

43:39.077 --> 43:41.997
Turns out they were on their way
to the ball game

43:42.164 --> 43:47.461
when a truck hit a patch of black ice
and swerved into oncoming traffic.

43:47.669 --> 43:52.466
Mr. and Mrs. Stone tragically
couldn't get out of the way in time.

43:52.966 --> 43:55.469
I couldn't believe something
that horrible

43:55.677 --> 43:58.972
could happen to a kid that nice.

43:59.181 --> 44:03.268
He walked right through that door
and into foster home after foster home

44:03.477 --> 44:06.188
until his 18th birthday.

44:08.774 --> 44:13.695
Oh, my. You poor, poor boy.
What in heaven's name did you do?

44:13.862 --> 44:15.197
Let's just get off of this.

44:15.364 --> 44:17.991
He didn't know how to handle it.

44:18.200 --> 44:22.162
What 12-year-old kid would?
He basically shut down.

44:33.882 --> 44:38.887
Davey, I'm so sorry.
I don't know what to say.

44:39.096 --> 44:41.473
There's nothing to say.
My parents are dead.

44:41.765 --> 44:44.560
Happy Chanukah.
Now, leave me alone.

44:47.187 --> 44:50.983
That's the saddest story I've ever heard.

45:00.993 --> 45:03.370
I'm out of here.
I don't need this sympathy crap.

45:03.662 --> 45:06.790
Maybe it's time you stop running
from your emotions.

45:07.166 --> 45:09.168
I'm not. I'm running from two crybabies

45:09.376 --> 45:12.379
who won't shut up about something
that isn't their business.

45:12.588 --> 45:15.591
You know, I read recently
in 'Reader's Digest'

45:15.799 --> 45:19.678
that people who let themselves cry
when they're hurting

45:19.887 --> 45:22.181
are often stronger than the people

45:22.389 --> 45:25.684
who try to hold all their pain inside.

45:25.976 --> 45:29.271
Did you read about a deformed referee
who spends 35 years

45:29.479 --> 45:31.398
trying to win some stupid patch

45:31.482 --> 45:34.485
so he can pretend people
actually like him?!

45:34.693 --> 45:36.987
Which month was that in?

45:37.362 --> 45:39.198
Take that back.

45:39.490 --> 45:42.659
If they have an award for the
freakiest looking fraternal twins

45:42.784 --> 45:46.288
who no one even gives a crap about,
you two are definitely winning.

45:46.497 --> 45:49.374
But that patch thing ain't ever
gonna happen for you

45:49.583 --> 45:53.670
because the truth is, nobody
in this town even knows you exist!

45:54.963 --> 45:56.673
You're an animal.

45:56.882 --> 45:57.966
And you're bald!

45:58.175 --> 46:00.594
Not again!

46:01.178 --> 46:04.890
You're not welcome in my house.

46:04.973 --> 46:06.892
Good, your house sucks!

46:07.059 --> 46:10.270
Do you have to be nasty to everyone
who tries to help you?

46:10.562 --> 46:11.688
That's my problem.

46:13.565 --> 46:15.359
He just a no-goodnik.

46:15.567 --> 46:19.363
And I am the real Kristi Yamaguchi.

46:22.574 --> 46:27.162
Wow. Just when you started to really
like Davey, he has a butthole relapse.

46:29.498 --> 46:30.791
Hey, fellas.

46:30.999 --> 46:33.585
You know, Eleanore really does
look like an owl.

46:34.878 --> 46:35.879
Sorry.

46:36.088 --> 46:38.882
Cheer up, Eleanore.
Let's just get ready for the banquet.

46:44.596 --> 46:47.683
It doesn't hurt to smell nice. Does it,
fellas?

46:47.891 --> 46:49.560
You're a good deer.

46:52.271 --> 46:56.066
Let's try the red wig. And please,
don't crap on my carpet.

46:57.276 --> 47:01.196
Well, while Whitey and Eleanore
are getting ready for the banquet

47:01.280 --> 47:04.283
the moron is having
a party of his own.

47:04.700 --> 47:07.161
And when people get in the state
that Davey's in

47:07.286 --> 47:09.496
they do really stupid things

47:09.663 --> 47:12.082
like go to a mall that's obviously
closed

47:12.291 --> 47:15.794
to yell at a woman who's obviously
not there.

47:17.880 --> 47:19.381
Shut up!

47:22.885 --> 47:25.179
Jennifer!

47:26.180 --> 47:27.598
Jennifer!

47:27.890 --> 47:31.268
What's the matter with the way I live
my life? Huh, Jennifer?!

47:31.476 --> 47:35.189
Where are you?! Home reading
your baby boy a bedtime story

47:35.397 --> 47:39.067
while he sucks his thumb
and goes pee-pee on his blanket?!

47:39.359 --> 47:40.861
Horseshit!

47:41.069 --> 47:45.491
Look who finally showed up.
We've been waiting for you all night.

47:45.699 --> 47:46.867
Who said that?

47:47.075 --> 47:49.495
I said that. Everybody wake up!

47:49.661 --> 47:51.163
This is not a rehearsal.

47:51.497 --> 47:52.789
Numb-nuts is here.

47:53.582 --> 47:55.083
Roger on that. Over.

47:55.292 --> 47:57.169
Let's do this, people.

47:57.461 --> 48:00.172
Just let me put my teeth in.

48:02.466 --> 48:03.759
How do you like your java?

48:03.967 --> 48:05.594
With a shot of whiskey.

48:05.761 --> 48:08.388
Let's try it black instead.

48:09.097 --> 48:10.474
That burns!

48:10.682 --> 48:13.477
Wake up, kids.
Our hot and sour friend is here.

48:14.394 --> 48:16.563
We're coming!

48:18.273 --> 48:20.192
It's about time you got here.

48:20.359 --> 48:22.069
I've been tossing and turning.

48:22.277 --> 48:24.696
I know. I was watching you.

48:25.364 --> 48:27.366
I mean, me too.

48:27.699 --> 48:29.660
What the heck is happening right now?

48:29.868 --> 48:32.287
Something that should have happened
20 years ago.

48:32.496 --> 48:33.872
Time to cry, Davey. Over.

48:34.164 --> 48:36.291
What? Get out of here. I'm leaving.

48:36.583 --> 48:39.878
You can run from Whitey,
but you ain't gonna run from us.

48:41.380 --> 48:45.592
We all heard what happened
At the skating rink today

48:45.676 --> 48:50.597
When Whitey brought up your sad past
You snapped and walked away

48:50.889 --> 48:56.186
Well, maybe they're onto something
That you should give a try

48:56.395 --> 49:00.983
Go ahead and let it out
And have yourself a cry

49:01.191 --> 49:03.360
Let it out, Davey

49:03.694 --> 49:06.071
Shut your wooden mugs

49:06.280 --> 49:08.782
Let it out, Davey

49:08.991 --> 49:11.660
Would you check out her bezugs

49:11.869 --> 49:16.081
You want me to deal with pain
Well, "Cheers" is what I say

49:16.874 --> 49:21.461
This here stuff just numbs the pain
It don't make it go away

49:21.670 --> 49:23.797
You try to act so tough

49:23.964 --> 49:26.466
But you just live a lie

49:26.675 --> 49:31.680
Why don't you show your feminine side
And have yourself a cry

49:31.889 --> 49:34.391
Let it out, Davey

49:34.683 --> 49:36.560
I'll pour you down the sink

49:36.768 --> 49:39.688
You gotta do it, Davey

49:39.897 --> 49:42.274
Y'all can bite my dink

49:44.776 --> 49:49.364
You labels and logos are wasting
Your time making me sit here

49:49.573 --> 49:54.578
'Cause nothing you can say or do
Will make me shed a tear

49:54.786 --> 49:57.289
He possesses a strong spirit

49:57.498 --> 49:59.291
And won't let down his guard

49:59.500 --> 50:02.085
So now we'll bring in the big gun

50:02.461 --> 50:05.589
His beautiful Chanukah card

50:06.673 --> 50:09.259
Take it, Davey. It might have money in it.
Over.

50:16.266 --> 50:21.688
Happy Chanukah to our wonderful son

50:22.064 --> 50:24.691
You fill our lives

50:25.067 --> 50:28.070
With joy

50:28.695 --> 50:31.281
Don't ever change

50:31.490 --> 50:34.660
The way you are

50:36.370 --> 50:39.164
You beautiful

50:39.498 --> 50:42.668
Twelve-year-old

50:42.876 --> 50:45.796
Boy

50:55.389 --> 50:56.890
Breaking and entering.

50:56.974 --> 50:59.685
I knew you'd screw
up eventually, Stone.

50:59.893 --> 51:03.897
I'm sorry.
Save your sorries for the judge.

51:12.364 --> 51:13.574
This is embarrassing.

51:22.666 --> 51:24.877
Come on, guys.
Okay, sweetheart.

51:27.171 --> 51:29.298
Don't be sad, Mom. I can be your date.

51:29.673 --> 51:32.092
You should let me be your date.

51:32.885 --> 51:38.098
I may be dirty and smelly,
but in the dark, I'm just smelly.

51:39.183 --> 51:42.186
Well, thank you, but he asked first.

51:42.561 --> 51:46.064
Oh, my God. Slow down.
Come on. I'm scared.

51:46.273 --> 51:49.776
Hey, why are we stopped now?
What are you doing? What's going on?

51:49.985 --> 51:52.362
Who's out there?
Do we need to call the police?

51:52.571 --> 51:55.866
Don't worry, Eleanore. I promise
you'll have a good time.

51:56.074 --> 51:59.578
All right, brother. Let's go win this thing.

52:06.084 --> 52:10.964
You look like Audrey Hepburn if she was
four feet and weighed 300 pounds.

52:11.298 --> 52:12.799
Thank you.

52:13.383 --> 52:15.469
Watch the ice, Eleanore. Don't slip.

52:15.677 --> 52:17.763
It's all good, Whitey.

52:19.973 --> 52:22.768
Eleanore Duvall? Is that you?

52:22.976 --> 52:24.478
Why do you want to know?

52:24.686 --> 52:26.188
What can we do you for, bub?

52:26.396 --> 52:29.399
I've been waiting to see your sister
for many years.

52:29.691 --> 52:32.361
Are you the kid who stole my wig?

52:32.569 --> 52:35.072
Yes, I'm Eli Wolstan

52:35.280 --> 52:38.867
and I've always felt bad about being
so thoughtless when I was young.

52:39.076 --> 52:40.994
So I wanted to return this to you.

52:41.495 --> 52:42.663
Thank you.

52:45.290 --> 52:46.375
Feel better?

52:46.792 --> 52:48.794
One more thing.

52:53.465 --> 52:54.967
Now I feel better.

52:57.469 --> 53:00.180
At least this one make me look pretty.

53:02.266 --> 53:06.478
Attention all officers. Davey Stone is
on the loose.

53:13.861 --> 53:16.697
Last bus to New York
City now boarding.

53:25.664 --> 53:29.793
Whitey, they were giving out lobster
bibs in the bathroom.

53:29.960 --> 53:34.673
That's not a lobster bib, Eleanore.
That's a germ protector for your tushy.

53:34.965 --> 53:38.260
Okay. Well, I'll use it here.

53:40.679 --> 53:43.473
My hiney is germfree and I love it.

53:45.267 --> 53:47.978
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm Mayor Stuey Duhy.

53:48.061 --> 53:50.481
I'd like to welcome you to the
35th annual

53:50.689 --> 53:53.484
youth league basketball
all-star banquet.

53:56.862 --> 54:00.782
For those of you celebrating Christmas
tomorrow, merry Christmas.

54:00.991 --> 54:02.659
Merry Christmas.

54:02.868 --> 54:05.787
For those of you celebrating
the eighth night of Chanukah

54:05.996 --> 54:07.664
happy Chanukah.

54:07.998 --> 54:09.875
Happy Chanukah.

54:11.877 --> 54:13.378
Going to the Big Apple, son?

54:14.087 --> 54:15.380
Yeah.

54:15.464 --> 54:16.673
Business or pleasure?

54:17.591 --> 54:18.592
Freedom.

54:18.759 --> 54:21.970
I see. You're one of them
hippie-dippy fellas.

54:22.679 --> 54:25.390
Everyone knows I like to start
these events with a joke.

54:25.599 --> 54:28.393
But I've been so busy at the hardware
store this year

54:28.560 --> 54:33.482
I've had no time to think of a great
one. But I thought of this driving here:

54:33.690 --> 54:34.900
Knock, knock.

54:35.067 --> 54:36.568
Who's there?

54:36.693 --> 54:39.363
Don't you.
Don't you, who?

54:39.571 --> 54:42.574
Don't you wish I hadn't been so busy
at the hardware store

54:42.783 --> 54:45.077
and had more time to think
of a great one?

55:13.188 --> 55:15.065
Mom, I didn't get that one.

55:15.274 --> 55:18.777
I don't think anybody did.
People just try to be nice to the mayor.

55:19.278 --> 55:21.989
It's gonna be a good night.
Let's get to it.

55:22.197 --> 55:26.368
The award for most impressive growth
goes to a kid who began at 4-foot-2.

55:26.577 --> 55:31.373
He is now about to take the stage
at his current height of 6-foot-5.

55:31.582 --> 55:33.083
Donald Hardy!

55:33.292 --> 55:34.585
Get up here, you beanpole.

55:36.962 --> 55:39.298
Saint Ignatius is number one!

55:39.464 --> 55:42.467
Hopefully that young man's getting
a weed whacker for Christmas.

55:42.968 --> 55:45.179
The mayor is very funny.

55:56.064 --> 56:00.194
Look at Davey, inches
from a clean getaway.

56:00.360 --> 56:03.572
But there's some things you
just aren't meant to get away from.

56:04.865 --> 56:05.991
What the hey?

56:07.284 --> 56:11.163
Whoa! Whoa! Hang in there, Betsy!
We'll make it! Whoa!

56:11.663 --> 56:14.082
Nice driving skills, pal.

56:16.793 --> 56:18.962
That's the strangest thing
I've ever seen.

56:19.171 --> 56:21.882
One thumbtack popped all eight
of my back tires.

56:27.179 --> 56:29.681
Okay. I see what you're doing.

56:30.682 --> 56:34.186
Who you talking to? Having one of them
hippie-dippy mushroom flashbacks?

56:34.394 --> 56:37.272
I need to go apologize to someone
before I leave.

56:37.481 --> 56:41.193
I know you hippies don't wear watches,
but it should be fixed in 30 minutes.

56:41.360 --> 56:42.694
I'll see you then.

56:42.778 --> 56:44.988
Run, hippie! Run!

56:49.660 --> 56:52.663
I'm just here to say I'm sorry
to the little guy. I swear.

56:54.373 --> 56:56.959
If I give myself a wedgie
will you believe me then?

57:05.467 --> 57:06.677
Okay?

57:10.681 --> 57:12.891
Glad we could work that out.

57:13.475 --> 57:16.895
I can't believe I'm in the same room
as the mayor.

57:17.062 --> 57:20.399
I can't believe how many rolls
you put in your purse.

57:20.566 --> 57:23.193
It'll be a nice snack for February.

57:23.861 --> 57:27.364
Ladies and gentlemen, this next award,
the Dukesberry All-Star Patch

57:27.573 --> 57:31.785
was created 35 years ago to recognize
people for their tireless work ethic

57:31.869 --> 57:33.662
their unparalleled generosity

57:33.871 --> 57:37.666
and their passion and dedication to
both the league and our fine community.

57:37.875 --> 57:42.379
Your hands are sopping wet.
Don't be so nervous, Whitey.

57:42.588 --> 57:44.590
I'm not nervous. I'm excited.

57:44.798 --> 57:48.594
I've been waiting 35 years
for this night.

58:00.564 --> 58:03.484
You see something?
Just some deer doing a pyramid.

58:03.692 --> 58:05.569
Okay, well, let's keep looking.

58:08.989 --> 58:10.365
Good job, fellas.

58:10.782 --> 58:14.286
Hand-picked by you,
the people of our fine town

58:14.495 --> 58:17.581
I now present the 35th annual

58:17.789 --> 58:21.293
Dukesberry All-Star Patch Award

58:21.460 --> 58:22.586
to

58:22.961 --> 58:24.796
Please let there be a miracle.

58:27.174 --> 58:29.259
Tom Baltezor.

58:29.593 --> 58:32.262
Tom, come up here and get this sucker.

58:35.390 --> 58:37.559
Attaboy, Tommy!

58:57.996 --> 58:59.873
We love you, Tommy!

59:10.259 --> 59:13.679
Nobody in this town even knows
you exist!

59:19.476 --> 59:22.980
All you people can bite
my germfree booty!

59:24.773 --> 59:29.486
Looks like I better do a lot more than
apologize. See you in 10 years, fellas.

59:32.573 --> 59:35.784
When I was a kid playing youth
league ball for Palmer Episcopal

59:35.868 --> 59:37.661
I dreamed of two things:

59:37.870 --> 59:42.666
Learning to make a lay-up with my left
hand and becoming a multi-billionaire.

59:42.875 --> 59:46.170
I think you all know which dream
came true.

59:46.587 --> 59:48.380
Wow!

59:48.463 --> 59:52.176
Sorry! That one caught me by surprise.

59:53.468 --> 59:58.891
And even though I don't recall scoring a
point during my four seasons of play

59:59.391 --> 01:00:02.394
the memories of the fun times
I did have

01:00:02.561 --> 01:00:06.190
made it very easy for me to purchase
the new digital scoreboard

01:00:06.398 --> 01:00:09.860
for the community center
earlier this year.

01:00:10.068 --> 01:00:11.570
Thanks for the recognition.

01:00:11.695 --> 01:00:14.364
Thanks for the scoreboard!
Thank you, Tommy!

01:00:15.574 --> 01:00:18.577
Excuse me! Can I just say something?

01:00:18.785 --> 01:00:21.079
There he is!
Stone, what are you doing here?

01:00:21.288 --> 01:00:24.374
Getting himself arrested, Mayor Duhy.
He broke into the mall.

01:00:24.583 --> 01:00:27.085
I love it! Your ass busted!

01:00:27.294 --> 01:00:29.963
Now you go to jail
and marry big, smelly man.

01:00:30.172 --> 01:00:32.299
Stone, you screwed up for the last time.

01:00:32.466 --> 01:00:35.594
That 10-year sentence I promised you
starts tonight.

01:00:38.472 --> 01:00:41.475
Please, just let me speak for one second.

01:00:41.892 --> 01:00:43.393
Are those tears in his eyes?

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.062
Finally.

01:00:45.771 --> 01:00:47.272
Let the guy talk!

01:00:49.399 --> 01:00:51.485
After all, it is the holidays.

01:00:53.487 --> 01:00:56.990
She's right. And then we'll
send him up the river.

01:00:59.868 --> 01:01:03.288
Okay, Mrs. Triple Nipple..
I mean, Mrs. Selman.

01:01:03.497 --> 01:01:06.583
Go ahead, Mr. Stone. Let's hear
your parting words of wisdom.

01:01:06.792 --> 01:01:11.296
I know you people don't like me or
care about my opinion, but here goes.

01:01:11.463 --> 01:01:15.968
Tommy, nothing personal, but Whitey
should have won the patch tonight.

01:01:16.176 --> 01:01:18.762
You're all crazy for not realizing that.

01:01:18.971 --> 01:01:23.267
Why would we give Whitey Duvall the
patch? So he could use it as a blanket?

01:01:32.276 --> 01:01:34.486
That's the reaction I thought I'd get.

01:01:35.195 --> 01:01:37.990
Everyone in this room has been
Associated with Whitey

01:01:38.073 --> 01:01:39.700
Through basketball or the mall

01:01:39.992 --> 01:01:45.289
Or various odd jobs he does around
Town for free or at most a dollar

01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:49.585
And I'm guessing 99% of you have
Either laughed in Whitey's face

01:01:49.793 --> 01:01:53.172
Or ruthlessly made fun of his feet or
Voice or sister or shortness

01:01:53.297 --> 01:01:57.176
When he wasn't looking

01:01:57.384 --> 01:02:01.180
But the next time you'd see him, he'd go
Out of his way to smile and wave at you

01:02:01.388 --> 01:02:03.473
And ask about your mother's operation

01:02:03.682 --> 01:02:08.187
Because he, unlike us, Cares
about someone other than himself

01:02:08.979 --> 01:02:13.192
The reason I bring this up to you

01:02:13.275 --> 01:02:18.280
Is because I was the worst offender

01:02:18.489 --> 01:02:20.782
Of all

01:02:23.494 --> 01:02:26.497
My life was simply going nowhere

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:30.459
Then a tiny, little man
Rushed to my side

01:02:31.585 --> 01:02:34.963
He should've gotten a big thank-you

01:02:35.964 --> 01:02:39.176
Instead he got a Port-A-Potty ride

01:02:39.384 --> 01:02:42.971
I was such a shithead

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:46.767
But he never quit on me

01:02:47.476 --> 01:02:51.688
Till I told him he was useless

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:55.275
And his sister was freaky

01:02:55.567 --> 01:02:58.987
Once when we were watching
Sunday football

01:02:59.571 --> 01:03:04.076
A fuzzy screen was all that
We could see

01:03:04.159 --> 01:03:07.371
Whitey came over with a hanger

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:11.083
And spent the game on top of our TV

01:03:11.375 --> 01:03:14.795
And when the lightning struck him

01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:17.881
He let out a wicked-loud yell

01:03:19.383 --> 01:03:23.387
But we just turned up the volume

01:03:23.762 --> 01:03:25.889
And ignored the burning smell

01:03:26.098 --> 01:03:28.892
We should all rot in hell

01:03:29.768 --> 01:03:32.771
I went to high school with Whitey

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:37.276
As a joke I told him to meet me
At the prom

01:03:37.776 --> 01:03:42.072
When he got there I said, "I can't
Believe you thought I was serious"

01:03:42.281 --> 01:03:45.492
So he ran home crying and
slow-danced With his mom

01:03:45.659 --> 01:03:49.997
What a crushing blow to Whitey

01:03:50.164 --> 01:03:53.292
I bet you wish you could take it back

01:03:54.293 --> 01:03:56.795
How could you all be
so mean to Whitey?

01:03:58.297 --> 01:04:00.799
Sound to me like you are all on crack

01:04:01.091 --> 01:04:02.092
Huh?

01:04:02.259 --> 01:04:06.263
Tonight Whitey was
counting on this town

01:04:06.597 --> 01:04:10.267
To show that we care

01:04:10.559 --> 01:04:14.062
But the first time he really needed us

01:04:14.271 --> 01:04:16.398
We weren't there

01:04:16.565 --> 01:04:21.195
And on Christmas Eve
And the last night of Chanukah

01:04:21.487 --> 01:04:25.574
It's just not fair

01:04:43.467 --> 01:04:45.260
I wonder if that guy

01:04:45.469 --> 01:04:48.889
Ever wiped his ass with
The wrong hand

01:04:49.389 --> 01:04:50.474
Yes.

01:05:11.995 --> 01:05:15.082
I'm so sorry they hurt you, Whitey.

01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:17.876
We should go to the mall.

01:05:18.085 --> 01:05:21.171
That place always makes me feel better.

01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:23.173
But it's closed.

01:05:23.382 --> 01:05:27.761
Maybe the night guard
forgot to lock the door again.

01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:30.889
Well, if he didn't, we can at
least sit in front of it.

01:05:31.181 --> 01:05:33.559
These are desperate times.

01:05:39.273 --> 01:05:43.193
Let the door be open.
Please, just give me that.

01:05:43.694 --> 01:05:45.863
Thank God.

01:05:46.572 --> 01:05:50.576
This is the most beautiful place
I've ever seen.

01:05:50.659 --> 01:05:53.579
It's like a sanctuary.

01:05:53.787 --> 01:05:59.084
Eleanore, could you just give me a
second to say a few words in private?

01:05:59.168 --> 01:06:03.088
Take as much time as you need, Whitey.

01:06:08.594 --> 01:06:11.388
Hey, mall, long time no see.

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:14.975
Fourteen hours to be exact.

01:06:15.267 --> 01:06:17.394
If you haven't heard by now

01:06:17.561 --> 01:06:22.774
I didn't get that patch I've been
telling you about for all these years.

01:06:22.983 --> 01:06:26.487
In fact, I've been
kind of kidding myself

01:06:26.695 --> 01:06:29.781
to even think I was in the running.

01:06:30.782 --> 01:06:31.867
You see

01:06:32.367 --> 01:06:34.369
the people of Dukesberry

01:06:34.578 --> 01:06:38.373
think I'm nothing but a joke.

01:06:39.291 --> 01:06:42.461
So I was kind of thinking

01:06:42.669 --> 01:06:47.966
maybe I should move to a town
where nobody knows who I am.

01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:53.597
At least then they'd have a
reason not to acknowledge me.

01:06:54.264 --> 01:06:57.476
I think Eleanore might like Florida

01:06:57.559 --> 01:07:02.773
and I hear they got some pretty
amazing malls there.

01:07:03.065 --> 01:07:05.359
You're not going anywhere.

01:07:06.568 --> 01:07:10.781
Holy shit, did the mall
just say something?

01:07:11.573 --> 01:07:13.992
No, it was me.

01:07:14.868 --> 01:07:16.995
What do you want, Stone?

01:07:17.162 --> 01:07:19.498
I came to apologize, Whitey.

01:07:19.873 --> 01:07:24.169
Well, there's nothing to apologize for,
Stone, because you were right.

01:07:24.378 --> 01:07:26.797
Nobody does care about me.

01:07:26.964 --> 01:07:30.592
I don't think that's true.
Do you, Mr. Mayor?

01:07:33.887 --> 01:07:36.682
Whitey, tonight for the first time
in years

01:07:36.765 --> 01:07:40.978
your partner, Davey Stone, actually
did a good thing for this community.

01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:43.897
What he do, steal beer for everyone?

01:07:44.273 --> 01:07:49.194
No. He made me see how great Whitey
is and how neglectful we've all been.

01:07:49.862 --> 01:07:53.490
That's why I'm here, Whitey.
I'm here to fix a big mistake.

01:07:53.782 --> 01:07:58.871
It's your moment, Whitey

01:07:59.079 --> 01:08:03.584
You've waited oh, so long

01:08:03.792 --> 01:08:09.089
It's your moment, Whitey

01:08:09.965 --> 01:08:13.260
We're here to right our wrong

01:08:13.468 --> 01:08:18.098
For service to the league and this
community, I proudly present to you

01:08:18.265 --> 01:08:23.270
the 35th annual Dukesberry
All-Star Patch.

01:08:24.188 --> 01:08:26.189
But this is Tom's.

01:08:26.773 --> 01:08:31.862
Mr. Duvall, the 35th All-Star
Patch is now where it belongs.

01:08:33.572 --> 01:08:36.783
I can't believe this is happening.

01:08:37.075 --> 01:08:38.660
And the 34th!

01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:41.787
And the 33rd!

01:08:42.288 --> 01:08:46.292
And the 32nd,
and the 31 st, and the 30th!

01:08:46.585 --> 01:08:47.669
-29th!
And the 16th!

01:08:47.877 --> 01:08:49.296
And the 28th!
And the 23rd!

01:08:49.462 --> 01:08:50.589
And the 27th!

01:08:50.671 --> 01:08:53.091
Oh, Whitey.
And the 11 th!

01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:55.093
And the 25th!
And the 18th!

01:08:56.761 --> 01:08:57.888
We love you, Whitey!

01:08:58.095 --> 01:09:02.684
You stepped up for me, Stone.
I don't know if I could ever repay you.

01:09:03.393 --> 01:09:05.270
Well, you can help me with my dream.

01:09:05.562 --> 01:09:08.564
You got a dream? What is it?

01:09:08.899 --> 01:09:11.068
To have someone wish me
a happy Chanukah

01:09:11.276 --> 01:09:14.488
and feel as good as I used to
when my dad would say it to me.

01:09:14.863 --> 01:09:16.865
Happy Chanukah, Stone.

01:09:17.282 --> 01:09:18.783
Merry Christmas, Whitey.

01:09:20.493 --> 01:09:25.082
You know, Stone, if my imaginary wife
and I ever have a son

01:09:25.290 --> 01:09:27.792
I hope you consider him a brother.

01:09:27.876 --> 01:09:31.380
Thanks, Whitey. And I'll pretend
I never heard you say that.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:32.881
Appreciate it.

01:09:33.173 --> 01:09:38.261
It's your moment, Whitey

01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:43.100
Enjoy, our tiny friend
Thank you. Thank you.

01:09:43.267 --> 01:09:46.185
Like the Bavarian cream-filled donut

01:09:46.478 --> 01:09:49.564
You ate last week

01:09:49.773 --> 01:09:52.192
Thank you. Thank you.

01:09:52.568 --> 01:09:54.570
Would you three show Whitey and I

01:09:54.778 --> 01:09:58.282
how to light the Chanukah candles
at our house tonight?

01:09:58.490 --> 01:09:59.700
You up for that, pal?

01:09:59.867 --> 01:10:01.660
And when Benjamin falls asleep

01:10:01.994 --> 01:10:05.164
the both of you can play
Spin the Dreidel for tongue kisses.

01:10:05.372 --> 01:10:06.373
Sounds good to me.

01:10:06.665 --> 01:10:11.461
Now, go live happily ever after or I'll
dropkick the teeth out of your mouth.

01:10:11.670 --> 01:10:13.881
That won't be necessary.

01:10:14.089 --> 01:10:17.092
They make a nice couple.

01:10:18.093 --> 01:10:19.678
I never

01:10:19.887 --> 01:10:25.184
Want this to end

01:10:28.479 --> 01:10:30.564
Don't worry, folks. Whitey's okay.

01:10:30.772 --> 01:10:33.775
This is the happiest seizure of my life.

01:10:33.984 --> 01:10:34.985
See, I told you.
