<i>Winter had come to Riverdale,</i>

00:04.022 --> 00:08.082
<i>and everyone was suffering
from an acute case fever.</i>

00:08.387 --> 00:10.322
<i>No one more so
than Betty Cooper,</i>

00:10.419 --> 00:12.275
<i>who was pouring
her considerable energies</i>

00:12.363 --> 00:15.217
<i>into beating the tar out of
Stonewall Prep's team</i>

00:15.305 --> 00:19.101
<i>led by, wouldn't you know it,
Bret Weston Wallis.</i>

00:19.189 --> 00:21.898
<i>The only person immune
fever?</i>

00:21.986 --> 00:23.575
<i>My pal Archie Andrews...</i>

00:23.670 --> 00:26.110
[sizzling] <i>-...who was feeling
a lot less lonely these days.</i>

00:28.111 --> 00:31.090
Hey, Archie. You okay?

00:31.418 --> 00:32.582
Yeah.

00:33.453 --> 00:36.731
- Yeah, I'm great, Uncle Frank.
- Not me.

00:37.523 --> 00:39.083
First day as foreman...

00:39.226 --> 00:41.425
Man, I'm more nervous than
when I started basic training.

00:41.512 --> 00:42.960
No, you're gonna do awesome.

00:43.234 --> 00:45.192
In fact, I got
something for you.

00:51.317 --> 00:52.715
It's Fred's tool belt.

00:54.106 --> 00:55.869
Yeah, I can't take
another man's gear.

00:55.957 --> 00:57.197
Especially not my brother's.

00:57.285 --> 00:59.317
Well, you're not talking it,
you're borrowing it.

00:59.809 --> 01:02.684
He'd want you to. So do I.

01:06.161 --> 01:07.247
Thanks, Archie...

01:08.316 --> 01:09.590
for everything.

[Betty sighs]

01:25.265 --> 01:27.799
[sighs] Thank God
for Bret's morning workouts...

01:27.887 --> 01:30.752
Jug, do not mention him
right now, okay,

01:30.840 --> 01:31.955
and ruin this moment.

01:32.043 --> 01:33.565
I just love getting you
all wound up.

01:33.653 --> 01:34.754
[Betty sighs]

01:37.699 --> 01:40.343
- Why are you smiling?
- Just everything.

01:40.946 --> 01:42.168
You're here,

01:42.324 --> 01:44.598
I turned in my draft
for the Baxter Brothers book.

01:45.072 --> 01:46.555
And Yale said...

01:48.215 --> 01:50.746
Yale said what?

01:50.910 --> 01:52.268
[Jughead sighs]

01:57.874 --> 02:00.484
Did you get accepted into Yale
and not tell me?

02:01.263 --> 02:02.793
Yeah, I think I did.

02:05.029 --> 02:06.489
Wow.

02:08.598 --> 02:13.864
Are you okay? - Yeah, no,
I'm just... I'm just processing.

02:16.091 --> 02:18.326
But I'm happy for you, Jug.

02:18.992 --> 02:20.822
I'm happy for you,
I'm proud of you.

02:20.910 --> 02:22.684
- Really?
- Yes.

02:23.473 --> 02:24.695
Yes.

02:24.949 --> 02:26.840
Let me show you
how much.

02:35.792 --> 02:37.580
[scoffs] You two
are finally done.

02:37.668 --> 02:39.301
I thought
I'd be late for class.

02:39.481 --> 02:42.010
Oh, I guess I'll see you
in New Haven next year.

02:42.098 --> 02:44.102
Of course, you'll just
be a visitor.

02:44.302 --> 02:47.437
- You got into Yale?
- Yeah. Don't look so surprised.

02:47.637 --> 02:48.731
And don't worry, Betty,

02:48.819 --> 02:50.879
I will try to keep
the co-eds away from Forsythe.

02:51.269 --> 02:52.572
No promises.

02:52.660 --> 02:55.571
But I do promise to crush you
finals,

02:55.873 --> 02:57.773
if Riverdale makes it that far.

03:05.142 --> 03:07.299
Dr. Beaker,
as our chemistry teacher,

03:07.387 --> 03:09.111
we are hoping
you have the skill set

03:09.199 --> 03:11.518
to help us with something
of a personal nature.

03:11.949 --> 03:13.760
Are you a rum drinker,
Dr. Beaker?

03:13.848 --> 03:16.508
[chuckles] Uh,
not during school hours

03:16.708 --> 03:18.705
and never with students.

03:18.793 --> 03:21.598
Ugh, calm down, Dr. Egghead.

03:21.692 --> 03:23.752
[exhales] We're simply
asking you to analyze

03:23.840 --> 03:26.432
our maple-based concoction
to ensure that our recipe

03:26.520 --> 03:28.424
is different enough
from Lodge Rum.

03:28.512 --> 03:32.471
That way, we can't be sued or
ceased-and-desisted by my father.

03:32.559 --> 03:37.692
So I ask you again, Dr. Beaker,
are you a rum drinker?

03:38.788 --> 03:40.494
The board that the runs
the Baxter Brothers

03:40.582 --> 03:44.104
has taken a look at the first draft of
your book, and they have a few thoughts.

03:44.192 --> 03:46.508
Well, one more global thought.

03:46.596 --> 03:48.387
They would like a new mystery.

03:49.613 --> 03:52.416
New mystery?
Like the whole book?

03:52.504 --> 03:55.682
They think the boy in the
river storyline is a bit soft.

03:55.770 --> 03:57.209
They're looking
for something darker.

03:57.296 --> 03:59.599
They mentioned something
about say, um...

03:59.877 --> 04:03.847
serial killers being a potential
fertile ground to explore.

04:04.254 --> 04:07.668
Okay, um, I'll just
have to think about it.

04:08.004 --> 04:09.322
Well, think fast,

04:09.410 --> 04:11.278
and have some pitches prepared.

04:11.379 --> 04:13.660
The Brotherhood is coming here
to meet with you.

04:16.387 --> 04:18.362
So, I need
some serial killer advice.

04:18.459 --> 04:23.145
My publishers want a dark and edgy
villain for the book, Charles.

04:23.233 --> 04:24.697
So now I have to
come up with pitches

04:24.800 --> 04:26.791
in the vein of Zodiac
or Hannibal Lecter.

04:26.879 --> 04:28.044
I figured you would
have some ideas.

04:28.131 --> 04:29.675
Yeah, sure, no problem.

04:29.808 --> 04:31.409
But don't you have
firsthand experience

04:31.497 --> 04:33.059
with an infamous
local serial killer?

04:33.292 --> 04:34.650
You mean the Black Hood?

04:34.933 --> 04:36.331
No, I couldn't
do that to Betty.

04:36.433 --> 04:37.603
Hmm, fair enough.

04:37.691 --> 04:39.516
Well, I've got
boxes full of killers,

04:39.604 --> 04:41.923
so I'll pick out my ten most
gruesome ones for you.

04:42.011 --> 04:43.960
Thank you, Chuck. I owe you.

04:45.756 --> 04:47.978
[Frank] I know you all
worked hard for my brother.

04:48.066 --> 04:49.463
Rest assured,
as the new foreman,

04:49.551 --> 04:52.104
I plan on busting my ass,
the same as you do.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.626
And I specifically want to
thank Tom Keller

04:54.714 --> 04:56.915
for filling in during
these difficult times.

04:58.495 --> 05:00.226
Cool, guys, let's get to work.

05:00.521 --> 05:02.561
- [workers applaud]
- [worker] Okay, guys, let's go.

05:02.674 --> 05:04.415
You know, Archie,
I would've appreciated

05:04.503 --> 05:05.986
a heads-up
that I was being replaced.

05:06.074 --> 05:07.486
I know, Mr. Keller, I'm sorry.

05:07.574 --> 05:09.596
It happened fast, but
Frank has a ton of experience.

05:09.683 --> 05:10.890
I think the crew's
gonna love him.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.745
I gotta be honest
with you, Arch,

05:12.833 --> 05:14.115
I don't know about your uncle.

05:14.205 --> 05:15.945
He's been trouble
since the day he was born.

05:16.033 --> 05:18.575
I must've arrested him a half
dozen times when I was sheriff.

05:18.663 --> 05:19.673
Oh, that was then.

05:19.761 --> 05:22.722
My dad believed in second
chances, Mr. Keller. So do I.

05:24.460 --> 05:27.055
[Quiz Show

05:27.331 --> 05:31.314
Welcome back to the Regional
Semi-finals.

05:31.402 --> 05:35.821
Seaside High trails Riverdale
210 to 240,

05:35.909 --> 05:38.150
and now for the final round.

05:38.350 --> 05:40.681
Which Venetian island
has been famous

05:40.769 --> 05:42.954
for glassmaking
since the 13th century?

05:43.042 --> 05:44.269
- [buzzing in]
- Murano.

05:44.417 --> 05:46.853
- [host] <i>Correct.</i>
- Never go in August. So many mosquitoes.

05:46.941 --> 05:48.736
What is the length
of the diagonal

05:48.824 --> 05:50.345
if the side
of the square is 10?

05:50.433 --> 05:52.001
- [buzzing in]
- 10 square root of 2.

05:52.089 --> 05:54.792
- [host] Correct.
- My brilliant little savant.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.626
Which of the following
is the powerhouse of the cell.

05:59.714 --> 06:01.588
- [buzzing in] - Mitochondria.
- [host] Correct.

06:01.675 --> 06:03.314
Which Americans
architect's house

06:03.402 --> 06:05.018
- in southwest Pennsylvania...
- [buzzing in]

06:05.105 --> 06:06.612
- Frank Lloyd Wright.
- [host] Correct.

06:06.699 --> 06:09.144
Who also designed Thornhill.
I knew that.

06:09.331 --> 06:12.884
[timer chiming] - Well, time's up.
Riverdale has won.

06:12.972 --> 06:16.022
They will go on to face
Stonewall Prep in the finals.

06:16.370 --> 06:20.109
Hey, Betty.
You did great out there.

06:20.277 --> 06:23.449
Great might not be
good enough to beat him.

06:24.355 --> 06:26.657
Ah, that's Bret, huh?

06:26.949 --> 06:31.847
Bret Weston Wallis clearly came
here to throw me off my game.

06:33.030 --> 06:34.986
Is there any way
you could help me with him?

06:35.074 --> 06:37.581
As long as it doesn't involve
shallow graves and lye.

06:38.119 --> 06:40.845
No, I just wanna
make him sweat.

06:40.933 --> 06:44.342
He's a son of a diplomat,
brags about being untouchable.

06:44.430 --> 06:46.983
But what skeletons
are buried in his closet?

06:47.295 --> 06:49.679
Any intel you could find
that would help me

06:49.767 --> 06:53.238
mess with his mind
would be much appreciated.

06:53.362 --> 06:55.777
Is it because he got into Yale
and you didn't?

06:56.613 --> 06:57.980
- [sighs]
- Alice told me.

06:58.100 --> 07:01.070
Charles, I worked my ass off
for four years,

07:01.459 --> 07:03.220
I put an extra time
Blue and Gold,

07:03.308 --> 07:06.556
I maintained a 4.1 GPA,
and I still didn't get in.

07:06.644 --> 07:08.644
Not knowing why
is driving me crazy.

07:08.732 --> 07:12.744
My former mentor at the FBI,
he teaches criminal law at Yale.

07:13.199 --> 07:14.902
I'll see if I can get you
some answers.

07:15.074 --> 07:18.348
About Yale [inhales] and Bret.

07:19.445 --> 07:20.909
Thank you.

07:22.420 --> 07:24.743
[Jughead] And so, anyway,
the Baxter Brothers

07:24.831 --> 07:27.691
are trying to catch this serial
killer named the Fish Monger,

07:27.933 --> 07:31.376
[sighs] who gets his name
because he guts his victims...

07:31.464 --> 07:33.844
The idea of a serial killer
is intriguing,

07:33.932 --> 07:38.799
but what we've heard so far
feels a bit... forced.

07:40.120 --> 07:42.352
Okay...

07:42.440 --> 07:46.047
What about a serial killer
that uses social media

07:46.135 --> 07:47.792
in order to stalk his prey?

07:48.564 --> 07:53.143
Forsythe's best work stems
from his personal experiences.

07:54.127 --> 07:56.026
Might I suggest
you start there?

08:05.456 --> 08:07.571
What about a dark
and ominous force

08:07.659 --> 08:09.165
that threatens
the town of Seaport?

08:09.253 --> 08:12.165
Uh, an obsessed killer
who is looking to expose

08:12.253 --> 08:14.571
the hypocrisy
and sins of his neighbors.

08:14.659 --> 08:18.548
The Baxter Brothers discover that
the man unleashing his righteous rage

08:18.636 --> 08:22.385
is the father of Bobby Baxter's
girlfriend, Tracy True.

08:22.473 --> 08:24.357
This sound promising.

08:24.878 --> 08:26.799
What's the name of the killer?

08:28.307 --> 08:29.807
Uh, the Brown Hood.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.345
If you give me a little more
time, I can come up with another...

08:33.432 --> 08:35.452
No, we like this.

08:35.792 --> 08:40.424
You ask me, this sounds like
a million dollar idea.

[grunts]

08:52.139 --> 08:53.565
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:53.653 --> 08:55.140
I just drove by the site.
Where are the guys?

08:55.228 --> 08:56.836
Oh, Frank called it a day

08:56.924 --> 08:58.727
and decided to invite everybody
back to your place

08:58.814 --> 09:00.980
for beers and tall tales.

09:01.068 --> 09:02.195
Oh, you didn't wanna go?

09:02.283 --> 09:05.148
Somebody's gotta balance the books
here, Archie, they're bit of a mess.

09:05.236 --> 09:06.297
How so?

09:06.375 --> 09:09.121
Well, for starters,
nobody received their Christmas bonuses.

09:09.328 --> 09:12.542
- Your dad never missed a year.
- We'll bounce back,

09:12.630 --> 09:14.683
Mr. Keller, we just
need more time.

09:14.941 --> 09:16.044
[Frank laughs]
You gotta remember

09:16.131 --> 09:18.233
at this point Fred is three
sheets to the wind, okay?

09:18.321 --> 09:22.172
And he's somehow convinced himself
that stealing Seaside's mascot

09:22.260 --> 09:24.527
would give Riverdale the edge
in the playoff game, okay?

09:24.615 --> 09:25.549
[door closes]

09:25.637 --> 09:27.668
So, he climbs over
this big fence, right,

09:27.756 --> 09:30.059
and he goes to grab Peter
the Pig out of his pen,

09:30.155 --> 09:32.974
and get this,
he can't climb back out.

09:33.062 --> 09:37.191
- [all laughing]
- He is absolutely trapped.

09:38.168 --> 09:40.634
So, the next morning,
security shows up,

09:40.722 --> 09:42.941
and there's Fred,
all curled up in the mud,

09:43.029 --> 09:45.247
holding on to
this squealing hog,

09:45.419 --> 09:48.263
and without missing a beat,
my brother says,

09:48.504 --> 09:50.766
"I got the bacon.
You got the eggs?"

09:50.854 --> 09:53.386
[all laughing]

09:59.905 --> 10:02.145
Your old man sure knew
how to pick a crew.

10:02.233 --> 10:03.982
Reminds me of the guys
I served with.

10:04.177 --> 10:05.972
Mr. Keller said
some of the guys were upset

10:06.060 --> 10:07.613
they didn't get
their bonuses this year.

10:07.700 --> 10:10.643
Hmm, you're so much
like your dad.

10:10.731 --> 10:12.700
Always worried
about other people.

10:12.958 --> 10:15.435
Relax, we got this.

10:20.799 --> 10:22.036
For you.

10:23.044 --> 10:25.099
How very generous.

10:25.495 --> 10:28.494
But do I need to remind you that I
actually own the patent on this rum?

10:28.582 --> 10:29.597
Correction, Daddy.

10:29.692 --> 10:32.994
You own the patent on sad,
tired molasses-based rum.

10:33.260 --> 10:35.313
Ours is maple-based.

10:35.505 --> 10:37.598
And, in a pre-emptive move
to rum-block you,

10:37.686 --> 10:39.103
we had a scientist analyze it.

10:39.191 --> 10:39.810
According to him,

10:39.986 --> 10:41.580
by making the main ingredient
maple syrup,

10:41.667 --> 10:43.968
our rum's DNA
has changed by 51%.

10:44.116 --> 10:47.045
[Veronica] Which means, legally,
you can't sue or stop us.

10:47.183 --> 10:50.112
And, should you be inspired to create
your own version of our invention,

10:50.200 --> 10:51.862
consider yourself forewarned,

10:51.950 --> 10:54.670
because we control
the patent on maple rum.

10:54.769 --> 10:55.987
So, toodles.

10:56.335 --> 11:01.571
In other words, Daddy,
our rum war is back on.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.886
Your instincts
were right again, Betty.

11:09.008 --> 11:11.806
As requested, I did some
digging on Bret.

11:12.009 --> 11:13.742
[Betty] And what did you find?

11:20.166 --> 11:21.416
[gasps]

11:26.332 --> 11:29.594
- Betty, what's up?
- I'm so onto you, Bret.

11:29.682 --> 11:32.264
God, you just think
you're so untouchable,

11:32.352 --> 11:34.238
and that everyone
is beneath you,

11:34.352 --> 11:37.576
but the truth is,
you are a filthy cheater.

11:37.664 --> 11:40.556
Whoa, Betty, hang on
for a minute, what's going on?

11:40.644 --> 11:45.463
Your roommate's father paid
someone to take the PSATs for him.

11:45.587 --> 11:47.598
Oh, but don't worry,
his father covered it all up,

11:47.697 --> 11:50.007
and then bought his way
into Stonewall,

11:50.095 --> 11:52.062
as I'm sure
he did with Yale, as well.

11:52.314 --> 11:53.515
Because the truth is,

11:53.603 --> 11:57.002
you haven't earned a single
thing in your life, Bret.

11:57.090 --> 12:00.076
You're just
a pathetic rich kid.

12:04.217 --> 12:06.450
Why're you making me out
to be the villain here?

12:07.533 --> 12:10.170
It's not like I'm the one
writing a YA fiction

12:10.258 --> 12:12.939
based off the exploits
of your deranged father.

12:16.232 --> 12:18.275
Is that what
your novel is about?

12:21.091 --> 12:23.213
Betty, wait. Betty?

12:26.024 --> 12:27.760
[Veronica]
Cheryl, I've been musing.

12:27.848 --> 12:30.517
We now have
a truly enviable product.

12:30.605 --> 12:33.034
But we still need to get the
word out to potential customers.

12:33.122 --> 12:37.385
So, what if we make I.
Bonne Nuit our base of operations?

12:37.473 --> 12:38.588
Query.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.807
Didn't your daddykins revoke
this place's liquor licence?

12:40.894 --> 12:45.031
We wouldn't sell rum.
We would hand out free samples.

12:45.241 --> 12:47.460
And, instead of being
a speakeasy,

12:47.667 --> 12:50.943
we'd reopen I. Bonne Nuit
as a dance club.

12:52.141 --> 12:53.398
Interesting.

12:53.486 --> 12:55.994
Sweaty people
equals thirsty people,

12:56.082 --> 12:58.455
equals people desperate
for overpriced mocktails.

12:58.543 --> 12:59.863
Meanwhile,
we covertly hand out

12:59.951 --> 13:02.131
samples of our
delicious homemade rum.

13:02.219 --> 13:04.188
Our coat check girl
could take down the names

13:04.276 --> 13:06.165
and orders
of potential customers,

13:06.253 --> 13:08.263
and the legitimate money
we bring in at the club

13:08.379 --> 13:11.280
could help fund
our shadow operation.

13:14.801 --> 13:16.832
- [door bells jingle]
- [music playing]

13:20.210 --> 13:21.428
[Fogarty] Kevin.

13:21.613 --> 13:22.613
[Kevin sighs]

13:22.743 --> 13:24.002
Now's not a good time, Fangs.

13:24.090 --> 13:25.543
I'm waiting
for my Grind'em date.

13:25.659 --> 13:27.512
[chuckles]
I'm not stalking you.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.910
I'm just picking up
a couple of burgers.

13:31.186 --> 13:35.980
But I want to apologize
for what I did to you.

13:36.331 --> 13:39.589
- I was under Edgar's control.
- Fangs, I get it.

13:39.810 --> 13:41.446
I was brainwashed
by Edgar, too.

13:41.534 --> 13:43.241
But that doesn't mean
we should get back together.

13:43.328 --> 13:45.723
Can we just go on a date
and see what happens?

13:45.987 --> 13:47.730
[door bell jingles]

13:47.818 --> 13:49.574
Sorry, my date just got here.

13:49.662 --> 13:53.439
- Hi, are you Terry? I'm Kevin.
- Nice to meet you.

13:54.199 --> 13:55.716
Listen, do you want
to get out of here?

13:55.803 --> 13:57.605
I have a room
at the Five Seasons.

13:57.738 --> 14:00.931
- Unless that's too forward?
- No, not at all.

14:07.091 --> 14:08.217
[sighs]

14:09.017 --> 14:10.860
[Betty] Tell me Bret is lying.

14:10.948 --> 14:13.895
Tell me that you didn't
exploit my family tragedy

14:13.983 --> 14:15.671
for a Baxter Brothers novel.

14:15.834 --> 14:17.803
Betty, it was a Hail Mary.

14:17.901 --> 14:20.328
I had to give the Baxter
Brotherhood something.

14:20.416 --> 14:23.023
I was never going to go through
with it without asking you first.

14:23.192 --> 14:25.671
And I didn't ask you because
I wasn't even going to do it.

14:25.759 --> 14:27.311
If you wanna use my life,

14:27.399 --> 14:28.880
you wanna write
about the Black Hood,

14:28.968 --> 14:30.784
have the guts to ask me.

14:30.872 --> 14:33.176
- Don't lie to my face.
- I wasn't lying.

14:33.264 --> 14:34.651
No, you were just
omitting the truth,

14:34.738 --> 14:37.541
which is exactly what you did
about the Quill and Skull,

14:37.718 --> 14:39.386
and about getting
accepted into Yale.

14:39.474 --> 14:40.355
I told you about Yale,

14:40.443 --> 14:42.553
I just had to figure out
the best time to do so.

14:42.641 --> 14:45.124
Oh, and the best time to do so
was right after we had sex?

14:45.219 --> 14:47.980
[stammers] There isn't a handbook
on how to tell your girlfriend

14:48.068 --> 14:49.317
that you got accepted
to her dream school.

14:49.404 --> 14:52.498
Yeah, especially not when the only
reason you got accepted to Yale

14:52.586 --> 14:54.695
is because
of this stupid school.

14:56.064 --> 14:58.849
[exhales sharply]
Oh, is that what you think?

14:59.108 --> 15:01.342
That I don't deserve
to go to Yale?

15:03.686 --> 15:04.974
[sighs]

15:13.672 --> 15:15.419
Thanks.

15:15.861 --> 15:18.407
Good news, fellas. I just got off
the phone with the mayor's office,

15:18.494 --> 15:21.609
and we've been hired to repair
the drainage system in the prison.

15:21.697 --> 15:24.102
Government job,
real money.

15:24.190 --> 15:25.945
We can't do that, Mr. Keller.

15:26.033 --> 15:27.407
We can't do business
with Hiram Lodge.

15:27.494 --> 15:30.435
That prison represents everything
wrong and corrupt about this town.

15:30.523 --> 15:31.983
We'd be taking
blood money from Hiram.

15:32.070 --> 15:33.297
My dad wouldn't do it.
I won't either.

15:33.384 --> 15:36.095
Archie, we can't just do
business with the people we like.

15:36.696 --> 15:38.372
Kid made his decision, Tom.

15:38.509 --> 15:40.279
Yeah, well, I think he's made
the wrong decision.

15:40.366 --> 15:42.282
I don't know if he should be
getting advice from you about it.

15:42.369 --> 15:43.679
Yeah, well, I'm family,

15:43.767 --> 15:45.201
so I got more to say
in this than you do.

15:45.288 --> 15:47.455
Look, I've made up my mind,
we'll figure out another way.

15:47.542 --> 15:49.515
And please, don't tell any
of the other crew about this.

15:49.602 --> 15:51.054
The morale's
low enough as it is.

15:51.142 --> 15:52.694
Let's keep it between us.

15:53.337 --> 15:54.380
Okay.

15:57.216 --> 15:59.685
Hey, Betty.
Do you have a minute?

15:59.885 --> 16:01.600
I just heard
from my mentor at Yale.

16:02.221 --> 16:04.482
[sighs] Yeah.

16:04.682 --> 16:07.026
What was it? My grades?
My essay? What?

16:07.226 --> 16:09.820
Just rip the band-aid
off, Charles.

16:10.020 --> 16:12.907
It wasn't any of that.

16:13.107 --> 16:15.867
It was that they didn't want to
accept the daughter of the Black Hood.

16:16.403 --> 16:18.971
They were afraid that if your
father's identity got out,

16:19.059 --> 16:22.503
it would generate bad press,
problems with other students.

16:23.056 --> 16:24.445
I'm sorry.

16:42.470 --> 16:44.700
What the hell
is wrong with you, Bret?

16:44.788 --> 16:46.137
Why would you go
and tell Betty that?

16:46.224 --> 16:47.178
How did you even know?

16:47.266 --> 16:49.151
DuPont mentioned something.

16:49.351 --> 16:50.992
I thought you were supposed
to be watching my back,

16:51.079 --> 16:52.687
- not stabbing it.
- Wait, look,

16:54.024 --> 16:55.896
I didn't do this
to hurt you, Jones.

16:55.984 --> 16:58.661
I did it to get under
Betty's skin finals.

16:58.749 --> 17:01.442
So you threw a live grenade
into my relationship,

17:01.530 --> 17:03.500
so you could win
a trivia contest?

17:03.588 --> 17:04.857
Of course.

17:04.944 --> 17:07.962
This is what it means
to be a Quill and Skull.

17:08.162 --> 17:12.999
To win at any cost, always.

17:22.635 --> 17:25.561
You'll never be satisfied,
will you, Dad?

17:26.480 --> 17:30.839
It wasn't enough that you had
to ruin my past and my present,

17:32.853 --> 17:35.545
but you had
to destroy my future too.

17:39.235 --> 17:43.062
Even rotting in the ground,
you still find ways to torture me.

17:45.908 --> 17:47.179
[sighs]

17:48.495 --> 17:50.734
Not anymore. [sniffles]

17:53.548 --> 17:54.820
I'm done.

17:58.504 --> 18:02.976
I hate you!

18:08.931 --> 18:11.812
Betty. Betty! Betty.

18:12.031 --> 18:14.653
Honey. It's okay, honey.
It's okay.

18:14.853 --> 18:16.198
- It's okay.
- [crying]

18:16.398 --> 18:17.879
I'm so sorry, honey.

18:17.983 --> 18:19.272
It's okay.

18:19.484 --> 18:21.156
Charles told me everything.

18:21.450 --> 18:22.796
I'm sorry.

18:30.870 --> 18:33.409
[Frank] There he is, Big Red.
Come join us.

18:33.527 --> 18:35.663
One second, Uncle Frank,
I'm just grabbing a soda.

18:35.833 --> 18:37.509
Uh, where was I? Oh, right.

18:37.709 --> 18:39.788
[indistinct chatter]

18:43.257 --> 18:45.022
- [Carlos] Hey.
- Carlos, did you want a beer?

18:45.109 --> 18:46.341
I'm good.

18:46.843 --> 18:48.919
Um, listen, Archie,

18:49.007 --> 18:51.583
I heard we turned down
a government contract.

18:51.671 --> 18:53.523
- Is that true?
- Where did you hear that?

18:53.685 --> 18:55.796
From my buddies
working the gig.

18:56.501 --> 18:59.061
Look, Carlos, that's not
the kind of job we take.

18:59.149 --> 19:01.063
Well, some of the guys
are pretty pissed about it.

19:01.150 --> 19:02.910
There's a lot of tension
on the site.

19:03.110 --> 19:06.471
Something doesn't change soon,
your crew's gonna quit.

19:06.781 --> 19:08.316
And some advice...

19:08.404 --> 19:11.210
You should spend a little more
time with your boots on the ground.

19:11.323 --> 19:12.973
At the site, with us.

19:13.774 --> 19:15.115
Okay?

19:19.418 --> 19:20.734
[Kevin chuckling]

19:28.022 --> 19:30.257
Okay, okay. [exhales]

19:31.264 --> 19:33.873
- What is with the tickling?
- [sighs]

19:34.684 --> 19:37.946
Have you ever
videotaped yourself?

19:38.146 --> 19:41.053
- Once. It didn't go well.
- No.

19:41.399 --> 19:43.340
Videotaped yourself
getting tickled?

19:44.444 --> 19:47.234
Why does every date I go on
have to get super weird?

19:47.322 --> 19:49.444
It's just tickling. No sex.

19:49.532 --> 19:51.973
You don't even have
to take off your shirt.

19:52.943 --> 19:55.469
I direct you
and another hot guy.

19:55.914 --> 19:57.162
It's fun.

19:57.963 --> 20:00.141
And it pays.

20:00.334 --> 20:02.678
- How much?
- Five grand a video.

20:02.766 --> 20:04.328
[chuckles]

20:07.675 --> 20:09.149
Um...

20:10.844 --> 20:12.479
So it's with another guy,
not you?

20:12.567 --> 20:14.369
I just work the camera.

20:14.681 --> 20:19.153
But I have someone
who'd be really into you.

20:19.492 --> 20:21.071
A total beefcake.

20:21.992 --> 20:23.308
What do you say?

20:24.734 --> 20:28.872
- Sure.
- Cool, I'll text my guy.

20:29.172 --> 20:30.987
He's waiting down at the bar.

20:35.328 --> 20:36.643
[knocking on door]

20:37.999 --> 20:39.898
You didn't have to come.

20:41.339 --> 20:42.922
Yes, I did.

20:44.212 --> 20:47.154
Especially after what your mom
told me downstairs.

20:50.092 --> 20:51.542
You okay?

20:53.012 --> 20:56.483
I mean, I fully spiraled
in a cemetery.

20:56.683 --> 20:59.902
No, you had a human reaction

21:00.102 --> 21:02.729
to a situation that was
totally out of your control.

21:02.854 --> 21:05.094
I'm sorry that I wasn't there
for you when you needed me.

21:05.307 --> 21:08.202
I love you.
I really hate when we fight.

21:08.402 --> 21:10.677
You deserve Yale, Jug.

21:11.113 --> 21:15.459
And I'm so happy for you.

21:15.659 --> 21:17.879
It's just hard for me
to untangle

21:18.079 --> 21:20.923
that from how sad I am
that I won't be going.

21:21.123 --> 21:21.954
[chuckles]

21:22.041 --> 21:23.676
It's not fair.

21:23.876 --> 21:25.568
But I've been thinking...

21:27.213 --> 21:28.667
Stonewall got me into Yale,

21:28.755 --> 21:32.352
but what if I could pay
it forward, helping you win?

21:32.528 --> 21:35.053
- You mean, Quiz Show?
- No,

21:35.679 --> 21:37.177
you've got that in the bag.

21:37.265 --> 21:41.241
I'm talking about the other,
bigger game that we're playing.

21:46.774 --> 21:49.675
[dance music playing]

22:17.207 --> 22:18.926
Cheryl, we're a hit.

22:19.014 --> 22:20.410
As is our maple concoction.

22:20.498 --> 22:22.259
But did you expect
anything less?

22:22.585 --> 22:25.038
And we already have a long
list of interested buyers.

22:25.187 --> 22:27.504
Let's keep those
free shots flowing.

22:28.299 --> 22:30.178
[man] <i>Sheriff's department.</i>

22:31.110 --> 22:32.370
What the hell is this?

22:32.578 --> 22:34.624
Haven't you been through
enough of them to know?

22:35.447 --> 22:38.455
- It's a raid.
- For some trumped up reason, no doubt.

22:38.543 --> 22:39.520
You may be mayor,

22:39.608 --> 22:41.866
but you can't just barge in
here like you own the place.

22:41.954 --> 22:44.608
Well, this warrant
says otherwise.

22:45.792 --> 22:47.239
It has been brought
to my attention

22:47.327 --> 22:49.779
that there is alcohol
being sold on the premises.

22:49.867 --> 22:51.934
False, we aren't
selling anything.

22:58.163 --> 23:01.774
You don't think I know
what game you girls are playing?

23:01.981 --> 23:04.117
Ladies, I'm the grand master.

23:04.310 --> 23:08.156
And when you play
against me, you'll lose

23:08.374 --> 23:11.629
every single time.

23:11.819 --> 23:12.840
[snaps fingers]

23:19.730 --> 23:21.171
[people gasping]

23:39.440 --> 23:41.422
[pop music playing]

23:50.105 --> 23:52.561
Are you sure he understands
what kind of video we're making?

23:52.649 --> 23:54.397
That it's just tickling?

23:54.485 --> 23:55.736
Relax.

23:56.571 --> 23:58.331
Daryl's one of my top earners,

23:58.531 --> 24:01.500
and subscribers love it
when opposites pair up.

24:01.700 --> 24:04.920
Trust me, I've done
hundreds of these.

24:05.358 --> 24:09.286
Did you say hundreds?
What kind of operation are you running?

24:09.585 --> 24:13.195
Play your cards right, stud,
and you'll find out.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.406
[cracks knuckles]

24:20.553 --> 24:21.395
[pours rum]

24:21.595 --> 24:26.999
Fear not, we have a new batch brewing at
Thistlehouse even as we lick our wounds.

24:30.705 --> 24:32.465
And to what end?

24:32.564 --> 24:34.896
To become floor polish
like that batch?

24:34.984 --> 24:37.370
And I know my father,
he'll just keep raiding this place

24:37.458 --> 24:38.918
[sighs]

24:40.614 --> 24:44.296
Yes, he will raid this place.

24:44.701 --> 24:46.573
Why're you saying it
like it's a good thing?

24:46.661 --> 24:51.037
Because I've just had one of my
hellaciously simple, yet brilliant ideas.

24:51.125 --> 24:55.220
What if we keep this location open
as a nightclub as a distraction?

24:55.420 --> 24:57.001
Get him to focus
on I. Bonne Nuit

24:57.089 --> 25:00.392
while we relocate
our rum business elsewhere.

25:00.592 --> 25:02.924
Do you happen to have
one of these magical realms

25:03.012 --> 25:04.509
tucked away
in your back pocket?

25:04.597 --> 25:08.124
Back pocket?
More like top floor.

25:19.861 --> 25:22.748
You're a natural, Kev.
You have a great laugh.

25:22.948 --> 25:24.431
Terrific timber.

25:26.201 --> 25:27.562
Great.

25:29.956 --> 25:33.968
You can make a lot more if
and when you build a following.

25:34.168 --> 25:36.351
Terry, this is
a one-time thing.

25:37.129 --> 25:39.849
That's a shame.
You could make some serious bank.

25:40.049 --> 25:42.031
All right, let me ask you.

25:42.802 --> 25:44.437
Would I always have
to work with Daryl?

25:44.637 --> 25:48.231
Daryl's popular, but, no. Why?

25:48.431 --> 25:51.276
Did you have
someone else in mind?

25:51.476 --> 25:53.308
Cheryl, what is this place?
[door opens]

25:53.396 --> 25:56.407
Mumsie's old brothel.
The Maple Club.

25:56.607 --> 26:01.411
The most exclusive gentlemen's
club in town, just sitting here.

26:01.611 --> 26:05.028
Okay, but is a former cathouse
really on-brand

26:05.116 --> 26:07.418
for our female
empowerment start-up?

26:07.663 --> 26:10.249
Mommy Dreadful was certainly
was no ally to the cause,

26:10.366 --> 26:13.767
but that doesn't mean we can't use
this place for our own purposes.

26:13.855 --> 26:15.161
[blows]

26:15.249 --> 26:17.248
Not only is its rent prepaid
for the rest of the year,

26:17.335 --> 26:20.264
but it is and has
everything we need.

26:20.464 --> 26:22.515
Private drinking club, check.

26:22.702 --> 26:24.893
Premium security system, check.

26:25.093 --> 26:27.619
List of Riverdale's
richest rubes...

26:32.560 --> 26:33.835
Check.

26:37.732 --> 26:39.324
Look at all the names in here.

26:39.524 --> 26:41.677
Cheryl, do you realize
what this is?

26:41.773 --> 26:42.847
Clients with
the financial means

26:42.934 --> 26:44.357
to pay at the price point
we require.

26:44.444 --> 26:46.277
Exactly.

26:46.364 --> 26:48.842
So, let's tap those scumbags
like maple trees

26:48.930 --> 26:50.898
and start making
some real money.

26:51.051 --> 26:54.368
As a valued long-term client,
we wanted you to be the first to know

26:54.456 --> 26:56.467
that the Maple Club
is reopening.

26:56.667 --> 26:58.580
No, we are no longer
a bordello.

26:58.668 --> 27:00.846
Think of it more
as a social club,

27:01.046 --> 27:03.293
offering exclusivity,
discretion...

27:03.381 --> 27:05.476
...and high-end,
maple-centric liquor,

27:05.676 --> 27:08.520
a brand so rare it can only
be purchased on the premises.

27:08.608 --> 27:09.872
[Veronica] Yes, I had a feeling

27:09.960 --> 27:11.076
that might be
of interest to you.

27:11.163 --> 27:11.974
Of course...

27:12.062 --> 27:15.183
- You'll be put at the top of the list.
- You'll be put at the top of the list.

27:16.437 --> 27:17.988
Between senior year

27:18.188 --> 27:21.199
and operating
La Bonne Nuit as a cover,

27:21.399 --> 27:23.509
we're taking on
quite the load.

27:24.904 --> 27:28.498
What we need is
a full-time live-in manager.

27:28.611 --> 27:31.179
Someone who will be
beholden to us.

27:31.953 --> 27:34.077
Who will live,
eat, and sleep here

27:34.165 --> 27:36.399
to ensure
things run smoothly.

27:39.334 --> 27:40.866
I have the perfect candidate.

27:41.030 --> 27:43.108
[Veronica]
You've got to be kidding me.

27:43.949 --> 27:48.227
- Cheryl, she's a killer.
- So was Betty's father.

27:48.483 --> 27:50.093
So was your father.

27:50.763 --> 27:52.030
True.

27:53.515 --> 27:56.430
Why have you come for me,
nightmare child?

27:56.518 --> 27:59.435
To offer you
a change of venue, Mumsie.

27:59.523 --> 28:03.702
And a way for you to work off
your debt to society and to me.

28:04.110 --> 28:07.757
As long as you're willing to
play by our tightly coiled rules.

28:08.819 --> 28:09.819
[scoffs]

28:12.200 --> 28:13.367
[Keller] I knew it was
gonna happen,

28:13.454 --> 28:15.657
I just didn't think
it was gonna happen this quick.

28:15.745 --> 28:17.044
What's the problem, Mr. Keller?

28:17.132 --> 28:18.843
There's 200 bucks
missing from petty cash.

28:18.931 --> 28:20.131
You know anything
about that, Frank?

28:20.218 --> 28:22.637
Yeah, I borrowed it
against my salary.

28:22.837 --> 28:23.911
You mean, you stole it.

28:23.999 --> 28:26.475
You can't steel something when your
family name's on the shingle, Tom.

28:26.562 --> 28:28.153
Your brother
put up that sign, Frank.

28:28.241 --> 28:29.643
It had nothing to do with you.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.514
Archie, I've done
my best to help you,

28:31.762 --> 28:34.052
but if you're gonna stand beside
a piece of garbage like this,

28:34.139 --> 28:35.483
we're finished.

28:35.713 --> 28:37.268
- Uncle Frank.
- [Keller grunts]

28:37.851 --> 28:39.292
Mr. Keller.

28:40.020 --> 28:41.752
[both grunting]

28:53.045 --> 28:55.889
That's it. I'm done. I quit.

28:56.144 --> 28:57.767
Any of you
who want to work a job

28:57.872 --> 29:00.669
where you actually get paid,
you know where to find me.

29:11.177 --> 29:13.854
Just gonna keep
giving me the silent treatment?

29:14.061 --> 29:15.495
I stuck my neck out
for you, Frank.

29:15.583 --> 29:17.006
How the hell could
you steal from the till?

29:17.093 --> 29:18.566
I didn't steal it.

29:18.801 --> 29:20.698
I borrowed it against
my future salary.

29:20.786 --> 29:21.988
If you needed money,
why didn't you just come to me?

29:22.075 --> 29:23.503
Because you're my nephew.

29:24.023 --> 29:25.727
I'm a 40-year-old man, Archie.

29:25.815 --> 29:27.330
I did eight years
in the military,

29:27.424 --> 29:28.522
seven of that in combat.

29:28.610 --> 29:30.399
How the hell do you think
it makes me feel

29:30.487 --> 29:32.553
to have to ask
a teenager for a loan?

29:34.949 --> 29:36.486
What did you even need it for?

29:36.588 --> 29:39.056
I got a hot tip,
a sure thing at the track.

29:39.166 --> 29:41.361
[scoffs] You're gambling
with it?

29:43.038 --> 29:45.908
I was trying to earn enough
to pay the guys their bonuses.

29:46.783 --> 29:49.905
But go ahead and think the worst,
Archie, everybody else does.

29:49.993 --> 29:51.308
[door opens]

29:52.023 --> 29:53.744
- [door closes]
- [sighs]

29:55.470 --> 29:57.189
[woman] All right,
we're on in five.

29:57.389 --> 29:58.789
[man 1] <i>One-two, one-two.</i>

29:59.917 --> 30:01.447
[man 2] <i>Sound check, please.</i>

30:01.936 --> 30:03.362
[man 3]
<i>Cam one, over here, please.</i>

30:03.553 --> 30:05.244
[indistinct chatter]

30:11.066 --> 30:12.381
[Jughead] Betty.

30:12.683 --> 30:14.484
This is Mr. Brooks,

30:14.681 --> 30:16.998
the Yale recruiter
I was telling you about.

30:17.891 --> 30:20.377
Recruiter? It's a pleasure
to meet you, sir.

30:20.537 --> 30:21.839
The pleasure is mine.

30:22.039 --> 30:25.051
Forsythe was insistent
I see you in action.

30:25.242 --> 30:29.129
- He's your biggest cheerleader.
- And I'm his too.

30:29.267 --> 30:31.548
- Okay, break a leg out there.
- Okay, thanks.

30:31.654 --> 30:33.013
Nice to meet you.

30:35.593 --> 30:36.898
- Betty.
- Hi.

30:36.986 --> 30:39.043
- Jughead told me about the recruiter.
- Mmm-hmm.

30:39.131 --> 30:40.763
If you win out there,
you get another shot?

30:40.850 --> 30:42.991
Yup, as if I wasn't
already stressed enough.

30:43.101 --> 30:45.553
Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I'm just
really excited for you.

30:46.170 --> 30:48.304
I left you a present
in the greenroom.

30:51.819 --> 30:52.986
[sighs]

31:17.104 --> 31:20.241
Oh, my God, Mom.
What did you do?

31:26.655 --> 31:30.406
Well, hello, everyone, and
Quiz Show.

31:30.605 --> 31:32.782
We have our returning
champions, Stonewall Prep,

31:32.896 --> 31:36.140
facing first-time finalists
Riverdale High.

31:36.278 --> 31:40.085
So, let's get quizzing.

31:40.173 --> 31:43.773
What country has the longest
coastline in continental Europe?

31:43.951 --> 31:45.163
- [buzzing in]
- Norway.

31:45.251 --> 31:46.286
Correct.

31:46.374 --> 31:48.304
- [buzzing in]
- The miracle of Dunkirk.

31:48.530 --> 31:49.599
Correct.

31:49.710 --> 31:52.533
- [buzzing in]
- Aft, bow, port, starboard.

31:52.710 --> 31:53.793
Correct.

31:53.881 --> 31:56.224
[buzzing in] - If the limit
never approaches anything,

31:56.312 --> 31:59.115
- the limit does not exist.
- [host] Correct.

31:59.300 --> 32:01.853
In his 1899 novella
The Jungle Book,

32:02.022 --> 32:03.740
- what author...
- Rudyard Kipling.

32:03.828 --> 32:04.881
[host] Correct.

32:04.972 --> 32:05.885
- [buzzing in]
- Demand...

32:05.973 --> 32:07.223
Demand side economics.

32:07.311 --> 32:08.426
Why are we even here?

32:08.514 --> 32:11.169
It's like she knows the answers
before the question are even asked.

32:11.971 --> 32:13.185
- [buzzing in]
- Burgundy, France.

32:13.272 --> 32:15.547
Oh, sorry, that's incorrect.

32:16.164 --> 32:17.381
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

32:17.469 --> 32:18.563
[host] To Stonewall.

32:18.862 --> 32:20.789
- [buzzing in]
- Cotes du Rhone.

32:20.926 --> 32:22.611
Oh, sorry,
that's also incorrect.

32:22.699 --> 32:24.126
It's Bordeaux, jackhole.

32:24.326 --> 32:25.905
Actually, Bret, it's Alsace.

32:25.993 --> 32:27.962
The correct answer is Alsace.

32:28.162 --> 32:29.770
Well, with the thrilling
back and forth,

32:29.858 --> 32:32.299
the score's still tied at 520.

32:32.499 --> 32:33.969
[dramatic music playing]

32:34.106 --> 32:35.783
Well, that sound
can only mean one thing,

32:35.871 --> 32:37.922
it is time
for our final question.

32:38.258 --> 32:42.452
It's all your, B.
Destroy that pleated khaki trash monster.

32:48.142 --> 32:49.486
For the win.

32:49.574 --> 32:51.756
In a manual
transmission vehicle,

32:51.894 --> 32:55.477
what mechanical device connects
two or more rotating shafts?

32:55.565 --> 32:56.880
[both buzz in]

32:58.629 --> 32:59.944
Spark plug.

33:02.029 --> 33:03.344
That is incorrect.

33:05.920 --> 33:07.168
[sighs]

33:07.326 --> 33:09.602
[host] Riverdale,
your chance to steal.

33:12.944 --> 33:14.259
The clutch.

33:15.585 --> 33:16.789
That is correct.

33:16.877 --> 33:18.472
- [bell chiming]
- [all cheering]

33:18.560 --> 33:19.745
[host] Riverdale has won.

33:19.833 --> 33:22.489
- Riverdale are the winners.
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>

33:23.884 --> 33:25.322
[host] Well, there
you have it, everyone.

33:25.409 --> 33:27.968
Another fantastic Quiz Show.
Thanks for joining in.

33:28.056 --> 33:29.523
[Alice] Say, "Victory."

33:29.699 --> 33:31.334
- [all] Victory.
- [camera clicks]

33:31.643 --> 33:32.958
Okay, that's cute.

33:34.539 --> 33:37.883
I'll take genius girlfriends
for 200, Alex.

33:37.971 --> 33:39.340
I don't know what's better,

33:39.428 --> 33:41.208
the win or the look
on Bret's face.

33:41.296 --> 33:44.020
Well, you're gonna to solve
every mystery in Connecticut,

33:44.108 --> 33:45.194
and we're going to eat
a lot of pizza.

33:45.281 --> 33:46.596
[Betty chuckles]

33:52.186 --> 33:54.280
[Alice] It looks perfect there.

33:54.582 --> 33:56.968
And I'm so glad to see that
you're not beating yourself up.

33:57.199 --> 33:58.806
You did what you had to do.

34:01.131 --> 34:02.891
Yeah, not in the way
that you think, Mom.

34:03.091 --> 34:06.019
I didn't use the answers
that you stole.

34:06.219 --> 34:08.478
I tore those up
and threw them away.

34:08.679 --> 34:11.289
I wanted to beat Bret
fair and square.

34:22.443 --> 34:24.703
- I take it the bet came in?
- Yeah.

34:24.902 --> 34:26.496
Turned $200 into ten grand.

34:26.766 --> 34:28.542
It's enough to pay the bonuses.

34:29.197 --> 34:30.513
We good now?

34:32.524 --> 34:35.132
This is great, Uncle Frank.

34:36.123 --> 34:37.842
But, no, we're not good.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.152
When you took that money,

34:39.286 --> 34:41.147
it felt like you were stealing
from my dad.

34:42.297 --> 34:44.556
I was just trying
to help, Archie.

34:44.655 --> 34:47.167
It's not what you did.
It's how you did it.

34:47.469 --> 34:49.380
Andrews Construction
isn't just a business,

34:49.561 --> 34:50.772
it's my dad's legacy.

34:50.972 --> 34:53.190
We treat it with honor,
with respect.

34:53.476 --> 34:55.041
This can't happen again.

34:57.123 --> 34:58.733
You sound just like him.

34:59.530 --> 35:00.880
And I understand.

35:08.572 --> 35:10.722
[students chanting]
Betty! Betty!

35:13.911 --> 35:15.644
[all cheering]

35:24.704 --> 35:26.600
We did it, Mr. Honey.
We won.

35:26.756 --> 35:28.422
You did, Ms. Cooper,

35:28.647 --> 35:32.249
and apparently how you did it
is a grave problem.

35:33.436 --> 35:34.871
I don't understand.
What do you...

35:37.184 --> 35:40.711
This was found in the trash
inside your greenroom.

35:42.981 --> 35:45.383
My office, now!

35:56.052 --> 35:57.312
[door closes]

35:57.456 --> 35:59.327
[footsteps approaching]

36:00.528 --> 36:01.662
[bag thuds]

36:04.216 --> 36:06.849
The school called.
I tried convincing Mr. Honey

36:06.937 --> 36:08.224
that you had nothing
to do with it.

36:08.311 --> 36:11.169
That this was my doing to try
to give you an advantage.

36:11.257 --> 36:12.799
To balance the damage
your father has done.

36:12.886 --> 36:14.201
I know, Mom.

36:17.168 --> 36:19.194
Why aren't you at work?

36:20.397 --> 36:23.153
Apparently, somebody told
my station manager,

36:23.249 --> 36:25.895
and I have been
put on leave without pay

36:25.983 --> 36:27.540
for who knows how long.

36:27.740 --> 36:30.059
I just don't understand,
how could anyone find out?

36:30.147 --> 36:32.386
I mean, where's the evidence?
I was so careful.

36:32.578 --> 36:33.658
Exhibit A.

36:33.952 --> 36:36.674
Someone must have
dug through my trash,

36:36.874 --> 36:38.264
probably Bret.

36:38.389 --> 36:39.670
But you didn't even
use these answers.

36:39.757 --> 36:42.067
Doesn't matter.
No one believes me.

36:42.155 --> 36:43.989
I saw how hard
you studied, Betty.

36:44.077 --> 36:45.599
You earned that trophy.

36:45.975 --> 36:48.294
Well, according to Mr. Honey,
Riverdale's victory

36:48.382 --> 36:51.475
has been tainted
by a cloud of scandal.

36:52.100 --> 36:55.637
So, it's been overturned.
Stonewall Prep wins again.

36:55.725 --> 36:59.327
And I've been suspended,
pending further investigation.

37:02.774 --> 37:04.866
[school bell ringing]

37:05.136 --> 37:07.497
Before I say
what I'm about to say, Fangs,

37:07.585 --> 37:09.231
I wanna make one thing clear.

37:09.319 --> 37:12.346
This is not about me
wanting to get back together.

37:12.434 --> 37:13.612
Understand?

37:13.787 --> 37:15.607
I've heard better
opening lines.

37:16.080 --> 37:17.812
I have a proposal for you.

37:18.475 --> 37:21.091
It's good money,
on-camera work.

37:21.179 --> 37:23.887
It's a little weird, but it'll
be infinitely less weird

37:23.975 --> 37:25.117
if I do it with someone I know.

37:25.210 --> 37:27.038
On camera?

37:27.163 --> 37:28.653
What're you talking
about, Kevin?

37:28.741 --> 37:33.953
Just... promise me you'll keep
an open mind. Okay, stud?

37:37.685 --> 37:39.497
Thanks for meeting me,
Mr. Keller.

37:39.585 --> 37:41.356
I wanted to make sure
you got your bonus,

37:41.444 --> 37:43.454
and to apologize.

37:43.694 --> 37:46.804
I'm a grown man, Archie.
I can take care of myself.

37:47.028 --> 37:49.503
Would you consider coming back
to Andrews Construction?

37:49.988 --> 37:51.498
You know that I want to,

37:51.854 --> 37:53.532
but if Frank's going
to be sticking around,

37:53.619 --> 37:55.811
I just don't think
that's a good idea.

37:56.709 --> 37:58.249
What if I made you foreman?

37:59.202 --> 38:03.136
Archie, you're a good kid.
You always have been.

38:03.336 --> 38:04.622
But you trust too much.

38:04.710 --> 38:06.544
I know who my Uncle Frank is,
Mr. Keller.

38:06.632 --> 38:08.649
Sure, he's a mixed bag.

38:09.304 --> 38:11.046
But I can't turn my back
on family.

38:11.777 --> 38:13.426
I understand that.

38:15.292 --> 38:18.794
Good luck to you. I just pray
that Frank Andrews

38:18.882 --> 38:20.585
isn't the end
of your dad's company.

38:21.589 --> 38:22.632
Thank you.

38:26.471 --> 38:30.290
One Maple Rum Punch
and one Maplejito

38:30.378 --> 38:32.528
for Mr. Arklight and his guest.

38:34.366 --> 38:35.780
How's the front of house going?

38:35.868 --> 38:39.020
Busy. Word is spreading faster
than a fire at Thornhill.

38:39.108 --> 38:41.507
- Hmm.
- [cell phone vibrating]

38:41.889 --> 38:45.551
It's Pop Tate. Apparently I.
Bonne Nuit just got raided again.

38:45.639 --> 38:48.575
Heavens, whatever will
your father find this time?

38:48.663 --> 38:53.528
Let me think, a club of sweaty dancing
teenagers imbibing virgin coladas,

38:53.616 --> 38:57.944
fizzy juice drinks,
and coffee-infused colas.

38:58.529 --> 39:01.533
To our two income streams
being up and running.

39:01.639 --> 39:03.067
I'll drink to that.

39:03.155 --> 39:06.839
[Penelope] Is this mask
absolutely necessary?

39:08.401 --> 39:10.497
It's mandatory, Mother.

39:10.585 --> 39:12.864
Unless you want someone
to find out your identity,

39:12.952 --> 39:14.153
you'll keep that false face on

39:14.241 --> 39:15.933
and stay within
the walls of the Maple Club.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.895
And if you get
the itch to run...

39:17.983 --> 39:20.797
..that ankle monitor and
proximity sensor I put on you

39:20.997 --> 39:24.607
will start screeching like
a cat in heat, Mrs. Blossom.

39:24.702 --> 39:26.302
Take this as a win.

39:26.390 --> 39:29.339
You're under house-arrest,
minding our shop whilst we're in school.

39:29.427 --> 39:32.614
But at least you're not in that
petri dish of a teen sex bunker.

39:36.732 --> 39:39.034
You're a pathological lunatic,
you know that, Bret?

39:39.132 --> 39:40.225
I know what you did to Betty.

39:40.312 --> 39:41.331
Easy, Forsythe.

39:41.419 --> 39:42.979
From what I hear,
she did it to herself.

39:43.067 --> 39:46.089
You consider yourself to be
this elite man of honor,

39:46.177 --> 39:48.456
but you are nothing more
than a joke and a coward.

39:48.544 --> 39:50.794
You know, when you say
things like that, Forsythe,

39:50.932 --> 39:52.120
it really upsets me.

39:52.525 --> 39:55.690
Oh, I'm sorry. Have I
besmirched your precious honor?

39:55.778 --> 39:57.396
- You're damn right, you have.
- Good.

39:57.528 --> 39:59.972
Because as stated by
the Quill and Skull charter,

40:00.060 --> 40:01.550
any dispute between two members

40:01.638 --> 40:03.437
can be solved
according to the code

40:03.525 --> 40:06.099
of the society
of the founding fathers.

40:06.490 --> 40:07.646
A duel.

40:08.161 --> 40:09.261
You can't be serious.

40:09.349 --> 40:12.210
Oh, I'm as serious
as a shot to the heart.

40:12.298 --> 40:14.379
[chuckles]

40:14.692 --> 40:16.667
- Um...
- Are you scared?

40:16.755 --> 40:21.269
No, amused at the thought
of your ponytailed girlfriend

40:21.357 --> 40:24.708
- weeping over your dead body.
- That's not gonna happen.

40:25.482 --> 40:28.462
- So, sudden death?
- Yes or no?

40:30.474 --> 40:32.309
- [door bells jingle]
- [music playing]

40:33.861 --> 40:35.042
- Hey.
- Hi.

40:35.130 --> 40:36.926
I got here as soon as I could.
What's going on?

40:37.013 --> 40:40.138
[crying] I just don't think
I can do this anymore, Arch.

40:40.226 --> 40:43.354
I keep waiting for Jug
to come back, but he doesn't.

40:43.442 --> 40:46.145
And he won't.
He won't ever come back.

40:48.138 --> 40:50.599
And I don't know
how I'm supposed to keep going.

40:54.982 --> 40:57.867
Day by day, Betty,
we'll get through this...

40:57.955 --> 40:59.191
together.
