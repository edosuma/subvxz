02:26.334 --> 02:27.333
Bastard.

02:44.125 --> 02:45.916
(HONKING HORN)

03:11.750 --> 03:13.666
A few days, you say?

03:14.125 --> 03:16.666
Not what I'd call a light traveller,
are you, pet?

03:16.750 --> 03:19.333
Sorry. It's mainly work.

03:19.417 --> 03:23.499
I wouldn't apologise
for having work, flower. Not round here.

03:25.834 --> 03:27.666
What's this, then?

03:27.750 --> 03:32.166
It's just a flugel. A trumpet.
I thought I might get some practice in.

03:32.334 --> 03:34.666
- In here, you mean?
- Well, wherever.

03:34.792 --> 03:37.249
Oh, I wouldn't mind, pet.
Don't get me wrong.

03:37.334 --> 03:39.499
If it were up to me,
there's nowt I'd like better

03:39.625 --> 03:41.499
than to hear you blowing
that bloody thing all night long.

03:41.584 --> 03:44.583
- Oh, no, it wouldn't...
- You've heard of Grimley Colliery Band?

03:44.667 --> 03:46.416
Yes, I have.

03:46.500 --> 03:50.249
Well, they have their own practice hall.
I should get meself down there, pet.

03:50.334 --> 03:53.958
They'd welcome someone like you
wi' open arms, knowing them.

04:06.125 --> 04:07.416
Another?

04:09.000 --> 04:12.749
It's a sad old day, in't it, V?
When it's finally come to this.

04:12.834 --> 04:17.749
- What's that, then, Ida?
- Your Jim and my Ernie packing in band.

04:17.834 --> 04:20.083
They are doing it, then? For definite?

04:20.166 --> 04:24.749
Aye. Last practice tonight, Ernie said.
Then resigning after.

04:25.167 --> 04:29.916
Well, no point in carrying on, is there?
Pit goes, band will go t' same way.

04:30.667 --> 04:34.333
Oh, I feel sorry for old Danny, mind.
He'll have bugger all to do.

04:34.417 --> 04:37.999
- We'll all have bugger all to do, V.
- MAN: You get used to it.

04:45.834 --> 04:47.124
(HUMMING)

04:59.417 --> 05:00.791
(RINGING BELL)

05:10.834 --> 05:13.624
- All right, love?
- Aye, all right.

05:19.167 --> 05:21.416
IDA: Don't forget what you're doing,
you lads.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.583
Don't be handing over any kitty money.

05:23.667 --> 05:25.999
- Just resignations.
- Aye, all right, pet.

05:26.084 --> 05:28.249
- Well, mind you do.
- What do you mean, "mind you do"?

05:28.334 --> 05:33.499
- It were our decision, weren't it, love?
- Aye, well, just mind you do.

05:37.667 --> 05:39.833
Now, let's get this right, Ernie.

05:39.917 --> 05:43.333
When he collects for t' kitty,
we say, "Sorry, Danny, but us two,

05:43.417 --> 05:46.666
"we've decided, in present climate,
to tighten our belts, like,

05:46.750 --> 05:49.166
"and only spend money
on essential items.

05:49.292 --> 05:53.583
"Sorry. It's been good and all that,
but right now we don't regard band

05:53.667 --> 05:55.999
"as one of t' aforementioned
essential items."

05:56.125 --> 05:57.833
"And regretfully, therefore,
we feel obliged

05:57.959 --> 05:59.499
"to tender our resignations forthwith."

05:59.625 --> 06:01.291
- Right?
- Right.

06:02.584 --> 06:04.916
Then we wake up in Casualty.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.416
Well, if he goes barmy,
it's not our fault, is it?

06:17.500 --> 06:19.916
- No.
- I mean, what's t' worst he can do?

06:20.000 --> 06:22.666
- Have an heart attack?
- Ah, what the hell.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.166
If Danny don't like it, bollocks to him.

06:25.250 --> 06:28.249
- All right, lads?
- All right, Danny, mate?

06:29.959 --> 06:34.333
Sixty years between us, you and me,
down t' pit, frightened of nowt.

06:34.750 --> 06:37.833
When it comes to telling Danny boy
we're packing t' band in...

06:37.959 --> 06:40.458
We're shitting bloody bricks.

06:44.167 --> 06:46.166
JOURNALIST ON TV: And coming up
later in the news,

06:46.250 --> 06:50.333
continuing our regular reports on
the Government's pit closure programme,

06:50.459 --> 06:54.083
we visit Grimley Colliery,
which, despite being one of the oldest

06:54.167 --> 06:56.416
and largest mines
in the Yorkshire coalfield,

06:56.500 --> 07:00.749
has nevertheless become
the most recent candidate for closure.

07:01.167 --> 07:03.916
Although the Grimley miners
and, indeed, their wives

07:04.000 --> 07:07.499
appear very determined to fight on
and keep their pit open,

07:07.584 --> 07:11.749
a redundancy offer to the workforce
is believed to be imminent.

07:12.334 --> 07:15.833
(CHANTING) The miners, united,
will never be defeated.

07:15.917 --> 07:19.666
The miners, united,
will never be defeated.

07:19.792 --> 07:22.916
JOURNALIST: Other redundancy offers
at neighbouring pits recently

07:23.000 --> 07:25.749
have been too attractive
for the miners to ignore.

07:25.834 --> 07:27.249
In the last few weeks,

07:27.334 --> 07:30.833
seven pay-off packages
have been offered to seven pits,

07:30.917 --> 07:33.916
all accepted, leading to seven closures.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.166
Trouble is, I'm no bloody happier
when I'm winning.

07:37.250 --> 07:39.583
- Double or quit?
- No, I best not.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.833
It's kitty night tonight.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.749
Cheer up, Andy. It might never happen.

07:44.834 --> 07:48.083
Representatives of union
and management meet tonight

07:48.167 --> 07:51.666
to discuss the redundancy offer
to be put to the Grimley miners.

07:51.750 --> 07:53.499
Bloody going to, though, in't it?

07:53.584 --> 07:55.583
- See you.
- See you.

07:57.500 --> 08:01.666
Don't be a pillock all your life.
Take money while it's still on offer.

08:01.750 --> 08:03.916
Hey, there's a lot of folk out there

08:04.000 --> 08:06.166
wouldn't like to hear
t' way you're talking, love.

08:06.292 --> 08:11.583
Aye, and they're all as daft as you are.
All end up wi' nowt, just like us.

08:11.750 --> 08:13.666
DANNY: (WHISTLES) Philip.

08:17.084 --> 08:19.333
I'm late for practice.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.958
- We'll talk about it later, eh?
- Later?

08:23.334 --> 08:27.791
You'll still be saying "later"
when we're out on t' bloody streets.

08:29.084 --> 08:33.416
There's always Mr Chuckles.
I can do more of that.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.082
Phil? Phil! Phil!

08:37.167 --> 08:39.332
You have a wife
and four bloody kids here

08:39.417 --> 08:41.332
in a house nobody will bloody buy,

08:41.417 --> 08:44.166
mortgage up to the bloody hilt,
loan sharks on our backs,

08:44.292 --> 08:48.249
no bloody money, no bloody job,
and what are you gonna do?

08:48.334 --> 08:49.958
Fucking juggle?

08:51.000 --> 08:53.624
Bit clumsy with the crockery,
your Sandra.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.083

Crap. That's what that was.
A load of bloody crap.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.166
What did Eric Morecombe say?

10:36.250 --> 10:38.749
All the right notes,
but not necessarily in the right order.

10:38.834 --> 10:40.666
- What happened to you, son?
- I just fell apart.

10:40.750 --> 10:44.749
Aye, well, you're not the only one.
Andy, lad, all over the shop, you were.

10:44.834 --> 10:47.416
- What is up with you lot?
- Got our minds on other things, Danny.

10:47.500 --> 10:48.666
Like what?

10:48.792 --> 10:50.999
Blimey, Danny,
you been on holiday or what?

10:51.084 --> 10:52.166
How'd you mean?

10:52.250 --> 10:55.749
Well, it may have escaped your notice,
like, but t' pit's under threat.

10:55.834 --> 11:00.999
- Aye. What's that got to do with us?
- Oh, aye, you're right. Not a lot.

11:01.250 --> 11:03.333
(MUFFLED LAUGHTER)

11:03.917 --> 11:08.166
Now, listen to me, all of you.
These are worrying times. I know that.

11:08.250 --> 11:13.333
But look what it says here, eh? 1881.
Over 100 years, this band's been going.

11:13.417 --> 11:15.833
Two World Wars,
three disasters, seven strikes,

11:15.917 --> 11:17.083
one bloody big Depression.

11:17.167 --> 11:19.583
And t' band played on
every flaming time.

11:19.667 --> 11:22.416
Danny, this is t' biggest disaster
of t' lot.

11:22.500 --> 11:25.416
Can't have a colliery band
without a bloody colliery, can you?

11:25.500 --> 11:28.666
Listen. We've got
the national semi-finals coming up,

11:28.750 --> 11:32.499
and we're capable, I mean it,
well capable of going through to London.

11:32.584 --> 11:35.916
The first time in our history.
The Albert Hall.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.333
Now, I know
there's a spot of bother at the pit.

11:38.459 --> 11:39.833
But that's summat separate.

11:39.917 --> 11:42.958
This is music,
and it's music that matters.

11:45.625 --> 11:48.166
Now, come on, kitty for t' weekend.

11:48.667 --> 11:51.833
Danny, me and Ernie,
we've been thinking it over, like.

11:51.959 --> 11:55.666
I know t' subs aren't much,
but the present climate and that...

11:55.750 --> 11:57.166
What are you saying, Jim?

11:57.292 --> 11:59.333
Me and Jim have made a decision, like...

Hello, love. Can we help?

12:08.167 --> 12:11.833

12:12.417 --> 12:16.166
No, love. Band's on Tuesdays.
Tonight's origami class.

12:16.500 --> 12:19.083

12:29.334 --> 12:33.583
Well, she said
you might let me play with you.

12:34.167 --> 12:35.749
Down, boy, down.

12:36.167 --> 12:39.083
Well, I know it may sound like
we need all the help we can get,

12:39.167 --> 12:40.249
but I'm sorry, love.

12:40.334 --> 12:45.583
I mean, usually, as a rule
we don't allow, you know, outsiders.

12:45.667 --> 12:49.333
Aye, I understand that,

- Alive and kicking?

13:55.000 --> 13:59.916
Oh, aye. I was saying, like,

you can always rely on our continued
and wholehearted support for the cause.

14:04.084 --> 14:07.666

He left it me in his will.
Couldn't let it go to rust, could I?

14:45.834 --> 14:48.916
Clever old sod. Even when he were gone,
he made sure I'd take it up.

Well, I know it won't be the same,

14:50.584 --> 14:52.499

just to hear it again.

Well, Jesus, they shouldn't have
even let the offer be put on t' table.

They do whatever the bastards want.

21:56.834 --> 22:00.166
It took that lot a year and half
to get me reinstated.

- It's 10 year ago, pal.

22:46.167 --> 22:47.499
You've got two options.

22:47.584 --> 22:50.916
One, you can vote
to take pit to review procedure.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.249
Obviously that's one
we want you to take,

22:53.334 --> 22:56.166
'cause we reckon
you've got a decent chance in review.

22:56.250 --> 22:58.916
Or, two, you can vote to take pay-off.

23:01.667 --> 23:06.666

that redundancy offer's gone up Â£3,000

23:10.250 --> 23:12.333

If you say no to it and stay put,

23:23.000 --> 23:26.166
they're pulling any future offer down
to a flat 15.

- No, Ernie, that just the point.

No, don't you worry, flower.
You've nowt to be ashamed of.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.291
No bugger else, then?

37:33.834 --> 37:38.958
Danny, I reckon I speak for everybody.
We'll play on while pit's open.

37:39.334 --> 37:40.999
The minute they close it, we pack it in.

37:41.084 --> 37:42.583
(ALL MURMURING IN AGREEMENT)

37:42.667 --> 37:45.666
- You can't ask for more than that.
- Hear, hear.

37:47.292 --> 37:50.791
No. Obviously not.

38:10.417 --> 38:12.499
- Hiya.
- Hiya.

38:13.250 --> 38:15.166
Moving words.

38:15.750 --> 38:18.333
- What?
- Back there. Danny.

38:18.584 --> 38:20.083
Oh, aye, daft old codger.

38:20.167 --> 38:21.999
If it weren't for band,
I reckon he'd pop his clogs.

38:22.125 --> 38:24.749
Listen, I wondered
if you fancied some grub?

38:24.834 --> 38:27.499
- Where?
- I don't know. I'll go posh if you want.

38:27.625 --> 38:29.666
- Andy.
- All right, Phil?

38:29.750 --> 38:32.791
- Have you seen me dad?
- Aye, he's still inside, I think.

38:34.334 --> 38:36.458
- Well?
- All right.

38:39.417 --> 38:40.666
(DANNY COUGHING)

38:50.667 --> 38:52.916
You all right, Dad?

38:56.417 --> 38:59.249
Thank you for your support, son.

39:04.584 --> 39:06.916
Oh, listen, Phil, lad.

39:07.667 --> 39:10.333
I've been thinking on it.

39:10.959 --> 39:15.916
Semi-final's no place for scrap metal.
Better find yourself a new bit of brass.

39:17.334 --> 39:20.583
I'm not forking out for a new trombone
just for one performance.

39:20.667 --> 39:23.083
One? What about the Albert Hall?

39:25.000 --> 39:28.333
Now, normally
I'd say get summat cheap, but...

39:28.459 --> 39:31.499
Well, you're a bloody good trombonist,
lad. You need a bloody good trombone.

39:31.625 --> 39:35.499
Dad, I like the band.

39:36.250 --> 39:38.999
I love the band. We all do.

39:39.500 --> 39:44.583
But there's other things in life,
you know, that's more important.

39:47.917 --> 39:50.499
Not in mine, there isn't.

39:53.959 --> 39:56.499
- What's that on your hankie?
- Eh?

39:59.417 --> 40:01.166
Oh, nowt.

40:02.125 --> 40:04.458
Chain come off me bike.

40:35.917 --> 40:39.124
Didn't realise we were going this posh.
I'd have got dolled up.

40:48.167 --> 40:51.833
You know back there, when Danny said
you had nowt to be ashamed of?

40:51.959 --> 40:54.249
Is that right, then?

40:57.917 --> 41:01.291
You work for bloody management,
don't you?

41:01.750 --> 41:03.249
- Andy, I'm just...
- Fuck.

41:03.334 --> 41:06.499
I just compile surveys, Andy,
just do viability studies.

41:06.625 --> 41:09.249
Boring, maybe,
but hardly summat to be ashamed of.

41:09.334 --> 41:11.083
No? Kept very quiet about it.

41:11.167 --> 41:13.916
'Cause I knew you lot would get it
all wrong, that's why.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.749
- Oh, aye?
- I'm on the same side as you, Andy.

41:17.834 --> 41:19.999
I want Grimley to stay open,
same as you do,

41:20.084 --> 41:23.083
and once it gets to review,
I can help it stay open with my report.

41:23.167 --> 41:26.083
- Bollocks.
- My figures show Grimley has a future.

41:26.167 --> 41:27.499
It's a profitable pit.

41:27.625 --> 41:29.666
They already know that.
It'll never reach review.

41:29.750 --> 41:31.166
The lads'll go for redundancy.

41:31.250 --> 41:33.416
And that's another thing
that you lot know,

41:33.500 --> 41:35.249
just how much to offer to get a result.

41:35.334 --> 41:39.333
Every miner I have spoken to
is voting to stay put.

41:39.417 --> 41:42.166
Do you think
they'd tell you any different?

41:42.250 --> 41:44.416
Four-to-one it'll go, for pay-off.

41:44.500 --> 41:47.249
- You're voting to stay put.
- 'Course I bloody am.

41:47.334 --> 41:52.166
- Then you must have some hope.
- No hope. Just principles.

41:53.625 --> 41:55.083
It's your first job for them, in't it?

41:55.167 --> 41:56.333
Otherwise you would know, wouldn't you,

41:56.417 --> 41:59.833
that your report means as much to them
as we do, bugger all.

41:59.917 --> 42:02.083
It's just a bloody PR exercise

42:02.167 --> 42:04.999
so blind, naive people,
people not unlike yourself,

42:05.125 --> 42:07.666
will think those good eggs
at head office have been very fair,

42:07.792 --> 42:09.999
very reasonable,
done their best, done their sums,

42:10.084 --> 42:12.583
and, oh, dear, they just don't add up.

42:12.667 --> 42:15.999
They'll have to close another pit.
Shame.

42:16.167 --> 42:17.999
They won't even read the bugger.

42:18.500 --> 42:22.083
They've already made their decision,
probably when you were still at college.

42:22.167 --> 42:24.833
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.624
Anyway,
if my job's so bloody irrelevant,

42:30.000 --> 42:31.999
how come you hate me so much?

42:33.500 --> 42:35.958
I don't hate you, I...

42:38.959 --> 42:41.624
- Who's the haddock?
- She is.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.499
I chose Grimley, you know.

42:53.625 --> 42:57.083
They offered me other pits,
but I chose Grimley for two reasons.

42:57.167 --> 43:00.083
First, because if I was going to help
keep one pit alive,

43:00.167 --> 43:02.166
I wanted it to be this one.

43:02.250 --> 43:03.833
Second...

43:06.917 --> 43:10.999
Hey, in't that
where the old bus station was?

43:12.417 --> 43:15.583
- I didn't think you'd remember.
- How could I forget?

43:15.667 --> 43:18.083
I'm sorry. Fumblings of a 14-year-old.

43:18.167 --> 43:21.583
- What did we call it? Top half only?
- Top half only.

43:21.667 --> 43:24.583
Can hardly have been worth it
at that age. Just kids.

43:24.667 --> 43:27.833
Aye. I'd get better value now.

43:28.125 --> 43:30.916
Well, that's inflation for you.

43:36.625 --> 43:41.333
I did know your name, you know,
when I called you Barry Andrews.

43:42.500 --> 43:44.416
I just didn't want you to think...

43:44.959 --> 43:49.624
I don't know,
that it was etched forever on me brain.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.749
'Cause it hasn't been, has it?

44:01.000 --> 44:03.749
Do you want to come up for a coffee?

44:04.292 --> 44:06.166
I don't drink coffee.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.833
I haven't got any.

44:33.417 --> 44:36.249
- Eh up, Phil.
- Jesus Christ.

44:36.334 --> 44:39.166
Did you like it so much
you want to go back?

44:39.250 --> 44:41.791
- What?
- Wakefield Prison.

44:42.250 --> 44:46.124
- What are you on about?
- Shall we call it a day, eh?

44:56.750 --> 45:00.083
- Evening, love.
- Night.

45:31.917 --> 45:35.249
All right, Andy, lad?
What have you been up to?

45:35.334 --> 45:38.166
Oh, a bit of extra practice, like.

45:38.750 --> 45:41.499
- Well, you're a genius, you, aren't you?
- What?

45:41.625 --> 45:46.333
Well, it takes a special talent, that.
Practising without your instrument.

45:46.417 --> 45:48.333
Oh, I must've left it in there.

45:48.417 --> 45:51.333
- I'll pick it up tomorrow.
- Right.

45:52.167 --> 45:54.916
Gloria on good form, is she?

45:56.584 --> 45:59.499
- Night, Andy, lad.
- Night, Danny.

48:03.709 --> 48:05.124
(INAUDIBLE)

48:30.334 --> 48:32.666
Mr McKenzie, could I have a quick word?

48:32.750 --> 48:34.749
Well, I'm actually rather busy, Gloria.

48:34.834 --> 48:38.416
Yes, sir, so am I. I just wanted to
make sure I wasn't busy for no reason.

48:38.500 --> 48:41.249
It's just,
some of the information I need,

48:41.334 --> 48:43.333
it's like getting blood out of a stone.

48:43.459 --> 48:45.666
I feel like I'm flogging
a dead horse sometimes and I...

48:45.792 --> 48:48.458
Shall we stop
talking in riddles, Gloria?

48:50.792 --> 48:54.666
I'm worried that my report
may be sort of

48:56.500 --> 48:58.333
immaterial.

48:58.417 --> 49:02.458
Your report is vital,
absolutely paramount.

49:03.167 --> 49:05.999
If this pit goes to review,
and we hope it will,

49:06.084 --> 49:07.916
we have crucial decisions to make here,

49:08.000 --> 49:11.083
and we can't make them
without detailed, accurate reports

49:11.167 --> 49:14.333
from highly qualified people
such as yourself.

49:16.834 --> 49:21.499
It's a tricky business, Gloria.
All we want to do is get it right.

49:22.459 --> 49:24.124
Okay?

49:31.917 --> 49:33.499
Yeah.

49:41.167 --> 49:44.833
Eh up, Andy. Look, there's your mate,
Miss Glorious Tits.

49:44.959 --> 49:47.333
What's she doing here?

50:00.000 --> 50:01.666
Now then, love,
what's a nice girl like you doing

50:01.792 --> 50:03.416
in an horrible place like this?

50:03.500 --> 50:05.166
Oh, hiya.

50:06.584 --> 50:09.458
- Hi, Andy.
- Hiya.

50:10.167 --> 50:12.833
I just came up to meet Andy out of work.

50:12.917 --> 50:16.499
He's not out of work yet, love.
Come back next week.

50:16.625 --> 50:18.583
I just wondered
if you wanted a quick practice, Andy?

50:18.667 --> 50:21.166
No, he can't, love.
He's going for a pint with us.

50:21.292 --> 50:24.333
- Oh, right. Well...
- See you.

50:25.750 --> 50:29.624
That's all right, innit, Andy?
Nice pint and a chat.

50:30.417 --> 50:35.249
We can talk about price of fish,
plight of the Third World,

50:35.792 --> 50:38.333
pros and cons of t' sweeper system

50:38.459 --> 50:42.583
and why your bird's got management logo
on her key ring.

50:52.500 --> 50:54.999
Still, it doesn't make her
t' devil incarnate, does it?

50:55.084 --> 50:57.166
What does it make Andy here?
That's what I want to know.

50:57.250 --> 51:00.499
Lay off him, eh, Jim?
He said he didn't know.

51:00.584 --> 51:01.999
I mean,
with legs like that round your back,

51:02.125 --> 51:04.499
you don't stop
and ask for a reference, do you?

51:04.584 --> 51:06.083
It's a mistake anyone could've made.

51:06.167 --> 51:08.666
Aye, and by hell,
we all wish we'd made it.

51:08.792 --> 51:12.458
- This isn't funny.
- Nowt wrong with shagging management.

51:12.959 --> 51:14.916
They've been shagging us long enough.

51:16.417 --> 51:18.083
Oh, don't tell me, Andy.

51:18.167 --> 51:21.666
It weren't shagging,
it were true love. Aw.

51:23.334 --> 51:24.499
SIMMO: You playing, Andy?

51:24.584 --> 51:27.583
No, he isn't. He's had enough
fun and games for one week.

51:27.667 --> 51:31.291
- I'm not a kid any more, Jim, all right?
- Oh, aye?

51:32.000 --> 51:35.124
- Old enough to be a scab, then.
- HARRY: Jim!

51:39.834 --> 51:41.666
ERNIE: It's all right, Andy,
he doesn't mean it.

51:41.792 --> 51:43.749
You don't mess around
with words like that.

51:43.834 --> 51:48.499
Aye, I'm sorry, Andy. Take it back.
You're just a stupid fucker.

51:51.959 --> 51:54.249
That's more like it.

52:01.750 --> 52:04.333
I'll catch you later, lads.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.499
Where are you off, then?

52:08.667 --> 52:10.999
(NOISEMAKERS BLOWING)

52:12.167 --> 52:16.333
Hello, kids. My name's Mr Chuckles.

52:16.417 --> 52:19.249
Hello, Mr Chuckles.

52:19.334 --> 52:21.083
- Now, do you like card tricks?
- Yeah.

52:21.167 --> 52:23.916
Will you help me with this card trick?
Come here, come here.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.416
What you have to do
is pick a card from there.

52:26.500 --> 52:27.999
Don't let me see it.

52:28.125 --> 52:30.999
And show it to all your friends
so that they can all see it.

52:31.084 --> 52:33.666
Now put it back anywhere you like.

52:33.792 --> 52:36.249
Tell me when you've done it.
Have you done it?

52:36.334 --> 52:38.583
Now I'm gonna shuffle them all up.
Did you see what the card was?

52:38.667 --> 52:40.416
- ALL: Yeah.
- Don't tell me.

52:40.500 --> 52:43.583
The card was the jack of hearts.

52:43.667 --> 52:45.333
ALL: No.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.416
- Queen of clubs?
- No.

52:48.500 --> 52:50.666
- What were it, then?
- Ace of spades.

52:50.750 --> 52:52.999
Correct. All right.

52:54.125 --> 52:55.916
All right, now, Scott.

52:56.000 --> 52:59.583
I'm going to put your watch there
and I'm going to fold this over

52:59.667 --> 53:05.666
once, twice, three times, four.
Just like that. All right?

53:06.500 --> 53:09.249
And with this hammer, Scott,

53:09.334 --> 53:13.249
I want you to give that watch
a great big smack.

53:13.334 --> 53:14.333
(SHATTERING)

53:14.459 --> 53:15.833
No.

53:17.667 --> 53:21.333
- When I say the magic word, Scott.
- Oh.

53:23.667 --> 53:27.333
- This isn't your main job, is it?
- I'm a miner.

53:28.584 --> 53:30.333
A miner?

53:32.625 --> 53:37.999
You remember 'em, love.
Dinosaurs, dodos, miners.

53:52.834 --> 53:54.749
Sorry, Sandra. A bit short, love.

53:54.834 --> 53:56.833
- How much?
- Â£1.50.

53:56.959 --> 53:59.666
- What's up wi' you?
- What's it to be?

54:00.125 --> 54:03.083
- What about them aeroplane things, Mum?
- What?

54:03.167 --> 54:06.833
- Them things wi' wings on.
- Oh, I need them.

54:08.167 --> 54:09.583
Here you are, love.
Put that back, will you?

54:09.667 --> 54:12.583
We'll use soap. Sorry, Vera.

54:12.667 --> 54:15.333
Me and sums, you know,
not what you'd call best of friends.

54:15.417 --> 54:20.458
- Me and money, total frigging strangers.
- Sorry, love. Still need another 60.

54:22.334 --> 54:25.166
I tell you what.
Give it us next week, all right?

54:25.250 --> 54:27.166
Are you sure?

54:28.584 --> 54:31.166
Don't forget your receipt.

54:42.167 --> 54:43.749
See you, love.

54:52.167 --> 54:56.333
Get back in here now with that.
Who do you think you bleeding are?

54:57.334 --> 54:58.999
- Hey!
- Bastard.

55:01.250 --> 55:05.666
Come here, you bastard. What do you
think you're fucking doing, eh?

55:05.750 --> 55:08.083
What do you think
you're fucking playing at?

55:08.167 --> 55:10.999
I told you, pal. It's payday.

55:14.084 --> 55:15.833
Yeah, all right.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.291
Right.

55:19.750 --> 55:24.083
- God, just give us a bit of time, eh?
- It's been 10 years, mate.

55:24.167 --> 55:28.083
Payday's payday, pal,
especially when it's 12 grand.

55:28.167 --> 55:30.499
- Twelve?
- Ah, it's that interest, innit?

55:30.584 --> 55:33.166
- It's a bugger.
- Well, what about...

55:34.500 --> 55:37.083
- Can you wait till t' 21 st?
- 21 st?

55:37.167 --> 55:39.666
Oh, ah. Coco the Scab, eh?

55:41.292 --> 55:43.166
We'll be back with truck.

55:43.250 --> 55:45.499
- Truck? What for?
- Contents.

I'll fucking kill you.

- Hiya, Danny, love. You well?
- Oh, aye, can't complain, Betty.

56:52.125 --> 56:53.916
What time do they announce result,
do you know?

56:54.000 --> 56:56.166
Oh, it's about 5:00-ish or summat,
I think.

56:56.250 --> 56:58.083
I didn't know
you were that bothered, pet.

56:58.167 --> 57:00.499

57:04.250 --> 57:07.166
Oh, that? I thought
you were talking about semi-finals.

57:07.292 --> 57:09.749
Honest, Danny. A day like today,

57:09.834 --> 57:13.749
you think anyone's interested
in some daft football match?

57:17.667 --> 57:18.666
All right, love?

57:18.792 --> 57:21.499
That's it, you bugger off
and blow your bloody trumpet.

57:21.625 --> 57:23.624
Blimey, a conversation.

57:24.334 --> 57:26.749
Harry, in a month's time,
when you're at home all day

57:26.834 --> 57:29.166
and there's nowt but dole coming in,
at least I can sit there, too,

57:29.250 --> 57:30.999
and know that I did summat.

57:31.084 --> 57:32.833
It weren't much,
but it were t' best I could do,

57:32.959 --> 57:36.416
- and at least it was summat.
- What are you on about?

57:38.292 --> 57:42.833
Ten years ago, before the strike,
you were so full of fight.

57:42.959 --> 57:45.666
Packed full of passion, you were.

57:46.459 --> 57:48.791
Now you just do nowt.

57:49.917 --> 57:52.958
All you do is blow your bloody trumpet.

57:53.500 --> 57:55.083
Aye, but at least...

57:56.917 --> 57:58.458
At least what?

58:00.250 --> 58:02.166
People listen to us.

58:06.834 --> 58:08.499
Go on, sod off.

58:15.167 --> 58:17.624
And it's a bloody euphonium.

58:22.334 --> 58:27.416
You know, I can't tell a lie, Ida.
I were never one for brass bands before.

58:27.500 --> 58:31.749
But when you hear that sound,
when you're near that sound...

58:32.500 --> 58:36.124
- Doesn't it half grab you, doesn't it?
- Aye, it does that.

58:37.000 --> 58:41.916
But, you know, folk like Danny,
it's taken over their lives.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.166
Ooh, I'd never let that happen.

58:47.500 --> 58:48.833
Ooh!

- Gorgeous.
- Oh, yeah.

What's happened to you?

59:22.959 --> 59:24.583
Sorry, Dad.

59:25.167 --> 59:29.458
- Bit of a domestic, like.
- But you know this is a special...

59:30.584 --> 59:32.749
Sandra did that to you?

59:33.500 --> 59:34.666
No.

59:39.167 --> 59:41.958
Go on, get on bus. Get it cleaned up.

Hurry, man! He can't breathe.

01:06:41.167 --> 01:06:44.583

- Don't crowd him, don't crowd him.

there'd be more news tomorrow.

01:18:24.459 --> 01:18:27.583
Gloria, it would've been very valuable

01:18:27.667 --> 01:18:31.833
if the Grimley miners had decided
to go to a review,

01:18:31.959 --> 01:18:33.583
but, as you know, sadly...

01:18:33.667 --> 01:18:36.624
You made them an offer
they couldn't refuse.

01:18:36.917 --> 01:18:40.999
- None of this is simple, Gloria.
- All right, I'll make it simple.

01:18:41.125 --> 01:18:42.583
I'll tell you some facts
the way I see them

01:18:42.667 --> 01:18:43.916
and you tell me if I've got it wrong.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:44.999

01:18:45.125 --> 01:18:47.499

that no one will ever read.

01:18:47.625 --> 01:18:50.666
They have to be seen to be written,
but they're not written to be seen.

01:18:50.792 --> 01:18:55.083
Two, Grimley is... Was a profitable pit.
Says so in here.

01:18:55.834 --> 01:18:59.499
Three, the decision to close it
wasn't made today,

01:18:59.584 --> 01:19:02.124
- it was made weeks ago.
- Wrong.

nowt good's ever happened to me.

to see if me luck had changed,

01:20:03.667 --> 01:20:05.333
but it never bloody has.

01:20:05.417 --> 01:20:08.499

with pit closing, losing me job,

walks into practice hall.

"maybe life's not so bad."

01:20:18.250 --> 01:20:21.499
But is it, buggery?
She's only fucking management.

01:20:21.584 --> 01:20:24.583
And now that's what you've been doing.

- You off back down south, then?
- Well, hardly welcome here.

01:20:47.334 --> 01:20:50.999
Reckon they all know now.
You were only trying to help.

01:20:51.625 --> 01:20:53.999
Thing is, if help comes to summat,
then you're a hero.

01:20:54.084 --> 01:20:57.666

Summat good will happen soon, Andy.
Hope it's at Albert Hall.

What?

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.666
They worked it out.
It'd cost three grand or summat.

01:21:52.834 --> 01:21:56.416

It died with everything else.

- Owt in?
- There's a machinist wanted.

01:22:49.584 --> 01:22:53.083
- You any good at button stitching?
- I'll take anything.

01:22:53.167 --> 01:22:56.124

01:23:05.125 --> 01:23:08.083
How'd he take it about us packing in?

Oh eh, Phil, come on.
You got to tell him, you know.

01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:16.833
- I mean, before final.
- I'm going to. I'm going to.

01:23:17.250 --> 01:23:20.791
- There a while yet, though, in't there?
- Saturday.

01:23:28.167 --> 01:23:30.416
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.

01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:33.249
What? Sandra and the kids?
I heard all about that.

Don't fret, they'll be back.

Well, to tell you the truth,

01:24:30.250 --> 01:24:33.083
I don't know too much
about t' harvest festival.

01:24:33.167 --> 01:24:36.416
But I do know a story about God.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.749
So, God was creating man, all right?

01:24:40.834 --> 01:24:43.666
And his little assistant
came up to him and he said,

01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:48.166
"Hey, we've got all these bodies left,
but we're right out of brains,

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:51.833
"we're right out of hearts
and we're right out of vocal chords."

01:24:51.959 --> 01:24:55.249
And God said,
"Fuck it. Sew 'em up anyway.

01:24:55.334 --> 01:24:58.333
"Smack smiles on their faces
and make 'em talk out their arses."

01:24:58.417 --> 01:25:02.416
And lo, God created the Tory party.

- WOMAN: Come on. May God forgive you.
- God?

01:25:06.167 --> 01:25:09.624

01:25:14.625 --> 01:25:16.749
He can take John Lennon.

01:25:17.584 --> 01:25:20.916
He can take those three young lads
down at Ainsley Pit.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.666
He's even thinking of taking my old man.
And Margaret bloody Thatcher lives?

What's Granddad got to do wi' it?

01:25:58.834 --> 01:26:02.083

are as poorly as Granddad is,

01:26:02.167 --> 01:26:04.666
you've got to do special things for 'em.

01:26:04.792 --> 01:26:08.166
Shane, love, your dad didn't buy
trombone for your granddad.

01:26:08.250 --> 01:26:10.249
He bought it for himself.

01:26:10.334 --> 01:26:14.583
He said Granddad's gonna die,
but at least Dad getting a trombone

01:26:14.667 --> 01:26:17.999
is gonna make him die happy.
That's what he said.

01:43:32.334 --> 01:43:36.458
- Well, sort of a chair.
- It all sounds very tempting.

01:43:41.167 --> 01:43:42.791
All right?

01:43:43.667 --> 01:43:45.833
Is that a thank-you?

01:43:45.959 --> 01:43:49.999
More than that.
Never known him gush like that before.

01:43:50.084 --> 01:43:54.166
Aye? Well, I suppose
that's what Yorkshiremen are famous for.

01:43:54.750 --> 01:43:57.333
Not showing their feelings.

01:43:58.084 --> 01:43:59.624
Right.

01:44:07.334 --> 01:44:10.083
I'm not gonna show mine, either.

01:44:10.167 --> 01:44:11.791
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

01:44:13.167 --> 01:44:14.791
MAN: Good on you!

01:44:17.334 --> 01:44:22.416
DANNY: All right then, lads and lassies,
Land of Hope and bloody Glory, eh?

01:44:23.292 --> 01:44:25.749
(PLAYING LAND OF HOPE AND GLORY)
