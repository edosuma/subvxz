WEBVTT

00:10.178 --> 00:10.944
DANNY:
Jack!

00:10.978 --> 00:12.180
JACK:
Yeah.
DANNY:
Sean!

00:12.213 --> 00:13.581
SEAN:
Coming.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.249
Time to go. Come on.

00:15.283 --> 00:16.517
Coming, Dad.
Coming.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.186
All right. Where's
my left attack?

00:18.219 --> 00:19.620
Right here.
All right.

00:19.653 --> 00:20.788
And my right
attack?
Here.

00:20.821 --> 00:21.922
That's what I'm
talking about.

00:21.955 --> 00:24.058
You guys get your helmets
and get your stuff ready,

00:24.092 --> 00:25.226
and Mom will take
you to practice.

00:25.259 --> 00:27.695
Got it.

00:27.728 --> 00:30.164
LINDA:
Maid's off today, Danny.

00:30.198 --> 00:32.133
Hmm?

00:32.166 --> 00:33.301
Dishwasher.

00:40.141 --> 00:41.242
And your fork.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.446
(sighs)

00:51.619 --> 00:53.187
Something wrong?
Something's
got to be wrong

00:53.221 --> 00:55.489
'cause I don't want to be
your personal servant?

00:55.523 --> 00:57.125
Well, I don't know.
You've just been giving me

00:57.158 --> 00:58.359
the stink eye
since I rolled out of bed.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.693
Yeah, at noon.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.429
Is that what this is about?

01:01.462 --> 01:03.297
Hello.
I worked a midnight tour.

01:03.331 --> 01:05.166
Which is why I asked
you to mow the lawn

01:05.199 --> 01:07.835
and take care
of the leaves yesterday.

01:07.868 --> 01:10.238
I didn't mow the lawn.

01:11.305 --> 01:13.207
I'll get it.

01:13.241 --> 01:15.143
Get out of here.
I'll get it.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.277
(sighs)

01:24.752 --> 01:27.421
Been a real pleasure.

01:28.889 --> 01:32.460
There's a suggestion box
around the corner, Detective.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.728
I don't know how you
can stand it around here.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.297
Well, it's the little things.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.199
You know,
the deluxe accommodations,

01:38.232 --> 01:39.600
first-class travel.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.169
Right.
What's going on?

01:41.202 --> 01:43.371
Well, one of your
lackeys tossed my case.

01:43.404 --> 01:45.206
That was my call.

01:45.239 --> 01:46.340
Your call?

01:46.374 --> 01:47.741
Yeah, you have one witness

01:47.775 --> 01:50.344
who's got a rap sheet
longer than the perp's.

01:50.378 --> 01:52.313
Well, I'm sorry
His Eminence the Archbishop

01:52.346 --> 01:54.215
didn't just happen
to be standing in an alley

01:54.248 --> 01:56.750
on 125th Street
the night my victim was mugged.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.286
Danny, we cannot
spend money on cases

01:58.319 --> 01:59.787
we know we're not
going to win.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.355
You think you can't win.

02:01.389 --> 02:02.490
You don't know you can't win.

02:02.523 --> 02:03.824
No, I do.

02:03.857 --> 02:05.359
Which is why they
went to the trouble

02:05.393 --> 02:08.196
of painting my
name on the door.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.364
If you guys aren't going
to prosecute these people,

02:10.398 --> 02:12.466
we might as well
just shoot them in the street!

02:24.212 --> 02:24.978
What's this?

02:25.012 --> 02:26.847
DANNY:
Oh, you don't want this stuff?

02:26.880 --> 02:28.649
You know, I thought it had
some sentimental value to you,

02:28.682 --> 02:30.218
and that's why you
left it in the car

02:30.251 --> 02:31.852
that I'm driving today.
I thought Rubino grabbed them.

02:31.885 --> 02:34.522
Oh, did you think Rubino
filled the gas tank, too?

02:34.555 --> 02:36.290
Oh.
You know,
what happens

02:36.324 --> 02:38.259
if my partner and I
are chasing down some mutt

02:38.292 --> 02:40.361
and he squirts
because the tank is empty?

02:40.394 --> 02:42.363
(sighs)
I'll fill it up now.

02:42.396 --> 02:44.298
No, you'll fill it up
at the end of your tour

02:44.332 --> 02:45.899
the way you're
supposed to.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.401
The same way every other
detective around here does.

02:47.435 --> 02:48.602
You got it?

02:53.974 --> 02:54.942
Everything okay, Reagan?

02:54.975 --> 02:57.411
Everything's fine, Sarge--
just peachy keen.

02:57.445 --> 02:58.912
Kelsey and I are just
going over ways

02:58.946 --> 03:02.283
to make things more efficient
around here, right?

03:02.316 --> 03:03.684
Right.
JACKIE:
Come on, Reagan.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.553
We just caught our first tour.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.721
At least we'll
have a clean car.

03:07.755 --> 03:09.690
Enjoy your tour.

03:09.723 --> 03:12.360
Yeah, it's going
to be a good one.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.330
DANNY:
Tell us what happened.
What happened?

03:16.364 --> 03:18.332
Tell us what happened.
WOMAN:
He tried to kill me!

03:18.366 --> 03:20.468
MAN:
It was a cantaloupe.
She threw it at me first.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.403
You have to arrest him.
Hold on. Hold on.

03:22.436 --> 03:23.371
The weapon was
a cantaloupe?

03:23.404 --> 03:24.438
Yeah, down from that window.

03:24.472 --> 03:25.673
Nearly hit me in the head.

03:25.706 --> 03:26.574
Could've given me
a concussion.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.709
Oh, and you decided
to throw it back up?

03:28.742 --> 03:30.278
Yeah, and he
smashed the window.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.012
Glass was flying everywhere.
Look!

03:32.045 --> 03:33.447
All right, here's what
we're going to do.

03:33.481 --> 03:34.882
We're going to
go find someone

03:34.915 --> 03:37.285
who's an actual criminal--
maybe someone with a honeydew.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.452
Okay? Good night.
Hey!

03:38.486 --> 03:41.322
This was attempted murder.

03:41.355 --> 03:42.856
And that is assault
on a police officer.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.925
How would you like it
if I arrest you, ma'am?

03:44.958 --> 03:46.360
Hey. Why don't you
do your job?

03:46.394 --> 03:48.462
Huh? What are we
paying you for?

03:48.496 --> 03:50.431
You're paying me to deal
with fruitcakes like you.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.300
Oh, really? You hear him?
Fruitcakes with fruit.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.303
Are you going to let him
talk to me this way?
Enough. Shut up!

03:55.336 --> 03:57.671
Be a man!
I'm going to
arrest you, okay?

03:57.705 --> 03:59.873
Reagan, let's go.
She wants me to earn my pay,

03:59.907 --> 04:02.443
I'm going to earn it right now.
Reagan, I'm getting
in the car!

04:02.476 --> 04:03.844
You'll spend the
night in jail.
No. Come on.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.579
Yeah, you are.
Police! Help me!

04:05.613 --> 04:07.548
I'm going to arrest...
JACKIE:
Reagan!

04:07.581 --> 04:09.283
Step aside. Step aside.

04:09.317 --> 04:10.451
Where you going?

04:10.484 --> 04:11.552
There's a guy chasing me.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.686
He's got a gun.

04:12.720 --> 04:13.754
Move away!
Get back.
Hey!

04:15.456 --> 04:16.390
Drop the weapon!

04:17.625 --> 04:20.961
Police!
I said drop your weapon!

04:20.994 --> 04:23.397
Drop it!
JACKIE: Police!
Drop your weapon!

04:32.573 --> 04:34.708
(train screeching)

04:36.977 --> 04:38.312
JACKIE:
Yeah, Central.

04:38.346 --> 04:39.347
Shots fired.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.548
We have one
perp down.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.483
We have a 10-85.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.518
He's still breathing.
Get a bus.

04:45.919 --> 04:50.324
Need an ambulance at the
corner of 18th and McDonald.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.692
Jackie.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.430
He's a cop.

04:56.464 --> 04:58.799
We have a 10-13.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.768
We have an
officer down.

05:03.371 --> 05:05.373
(ringing)

05:06.640 --> 05:08.642
Reagan.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.849
I'm on my way.

05:20.454 --> 05:21.589
Francis?

05:22.756 --> 05:24.758
How bad?

05:55.155 --> 05:57.491
Hey! You hang on!

05:57.525 --> 05:59.560
You hear me?
I am not going to lose you!

05:59.593 --> 06:01.629
Jackie!
I'm going as
fast as I can.

06:01.662 --> 06:02.996
Go faster!

06:03.030 --> 06:04.498
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

06:04.532 --> 06:05.833
You keep your eyes open.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.669
Do not close your eyes
on me, damn it.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.637
(honking horn)
Listen to me.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.839
(siren blaring)

06:18.679 --> 06:20.113
Listen, he's a cop.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.649
He's a cop.
His name is Lou Tedesco.

06:21.682 --> 06:22.950
Who's a doctor here?

06:22.983 --> 06:25.018
I am.
He's got two rounds
to the chest.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.119
Nine-millimeter,
about 12 minutes ago.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.688
You hear me? Come on!

06:27.721 --> 06:28.756
We got him,
Detective. Let go.
Hurry up.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.123
Let go, Detective!
Wait!

06:30.157 --> 06:31.925
We got him.
Help him.

06:31.959 --> 06:34.662
Help him.
We've got him. We've got him.

06:35.963 --> 06:38.499
Come on. Come on.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.142
Here you go.

06:50.644 --> 06:53.747
Any news?

06:53.781 --> 06:55.749
Nurse came by.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.485
He's still in surgery.

06:57.518 --> 07:00.654
They had to remove part
of his lung, Jack.

07:01.689 --> 07:02.623
He's got internal bleeding

07:02.656 --> 07:05.859
and a concussion
from falling down the steps.

07:05.893 --> 07:08.596
(sighs)

07:09.663 --> 07:11.499
(footsteps)

07:11.532 --> 07:13.534
(crying)

07:16.637 --> 07:18.872
That's Tedesco's wife.

07:18.906 --> 07:21.709
Heard her talking
to the doctor.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.647
Look at me.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.850
Danny.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.151
It was a good shoot.

07:31.184 --> 07:33.787
There's nothing good
about this, Jackie.

07:33.821 --> 07:36.657
He did not identify himself
as a police officer.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.659
You did what you
were supposed to do.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.794
We did what we
were trained to do.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.763
You didn't fire.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.164
'Cause the cantaloupe people
were in my way.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.733
But you know what?
If they weren't,

07:45.766 --> 07:47.635
I'd be in the exact
same boat as you.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.903
Don't do this to yourself.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.273
Detectives Reagan,

07:53.306 --> 07:54.642
Curatola?

07:54.675 --> 07:56.577
Captain Derek Elwood.

07:56.610 --> 07:59.680
I'll be the shooting
team leader on this.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.549
Are you two holding up?

08:01.582 --> 08:02.916
Fine, sir.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.952
Yeah.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.654
As you know, Detective Reagan,

08:06.687 --> 08:08.689
I'm going to need
to ask you some questions.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.257
But before I do,
I need to advise you

08:10.290 --> 08:12.726
that you're entitled to have
your union representative

08:12.760 --> 08:14.728
and your counsel present.

08:14.762 --> 08:15.696
Do you wish
to do so?

08:15.729 --> 08:16.897
No.
Danny.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.131
It's all right.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.700
I got nothing to hide.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.707
Right this way.

08:33.781 --> 08:36.116
We identified
ourselves and...

08:36.149 --> 08:38.952
we yelled out for him to stop
three or four times.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.854
He just kept coming.

08:40.888 --> 08:46.093
Was it, uh... was it
three or four times...

08:47.595 --> 08:49.262
...that you told him to stop?

08:49.296 --> 08:51.565
I don't know.
And you're certain

08:51.599 --> 08:54.201
that he, uh, never identified
himself as a police officer?

08:54.234 --> 08:55.569
Yeah.

08:55.603 --> 08:56.770
How sure?

08:56.804 --> 08:58.672
He never said he was a cop.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.107
Did he say anything?

09:00.140 --> 09:01.775
I don't think so.

09:01.809 --> 09:02.910
You don't think so?

09:05.913 --> 09:08.248
(sighs)

09:08.281 --> 09:11.351
It was loud.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.220
There was a train
coming in overhead.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.188
It was noisy.
I don't think so.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.790
Okay.

09:16.824 --> 09:18.792
Why don't you go back
to your squad,

09:18.826 --> 09:21.028
Detective,
fill out

09:21.061 --> 09:23.931
your firearms discharge report,
and we'll be in touch.

09:28.702 --> 09:29.770
Officer Tedesco's
still in surgery.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.004
I'm afraid he's
critical, Frank.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.873
His wife and son are
here, and we're doing

09:32.906 --> 09:34.341
everything we can to
make them comfortable.

09:34.374 --> 09:36.810
I'd like a moment with her
when she's up to it.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.145
Of course.
I read Tedesco's file.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.180
He's a good cop.

09:41.649 --> 09:42.950
Danny's okay.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.258
As you were.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.093
Ed?

09:53.126 --> 09:55.929
Do we know why Officer Tedesco
was in pursuit?

09:55.963 --> 09:56.997
No. He was off duty.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.065
We're checking,

09:58.098 --> 09:59.299
but it doesn't appear

09:59.332 --> 10:01.134
that he made
any 911 calls.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.871
We do know that he lives
in the vicinity.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.906
Possibly he came upon
a crime in progress.

10:05.939 --> 10:06.840
Let's know, not guess.

10:06.874 --> 10:08.909
What about the male white
he was chasing?

10:08.942 --> 10:10.143
Nothing yet, sir.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.912
We need to find him, Ed.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.081
Commissioner.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.415
Commissioner!

10:15.448 --> 10:17.851
Is it true this was
a friendly fire incident?

10:17.885 --> 10:19.953
Uh, we're still in the
information gathering phase

10:19.987 --> 10:21.855
of this investigation,
so we won't be

10:21.889 --> 10:23.356
discussing details
till we have all the facts.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.726
A blogger is reporting
that your son was the detective

10:25.759 --> 10:27.360
who fired the shots,
Commissioner.

10:27.394 --> 10:28.395
Can you confirm that?

10:28.428 --> 10:29.897
Okay, people,
how many times...

10:29.930 --> 10:31.799
We have an officer down.

10:31.832 --> 10:34.434
As much as we'd appreciate
your understanding

10:34.467 --> 10:37.170
and compassion
in this delicate circumstance,

10:37.204 --> 10:39.940
I realize that
is an unrealistic hope.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.174
Okay, Jane, Matt,
you know what?

10:41.208 --> 10:42.409
Why don't you
come this way?

10:42.442 --> 10:45.378
Let me share what
details I can offer.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.319
(horns honking in distance)

10:59.226 --> 11:00.994
Danny?

11:01.028 --> 11:01.995
Danny?

11:06.967 --> 11:08.936
What are you
doing here?

11:08.969 --> 11:10.971
Of course I'm here.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.039
Who's with the kids?

11:12.072 --> 11:14.875
Erin and Nicky. They're fine.
They're sound asleep.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.944
How are you?
I'm all right.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.879
I'm all right.
I'm not so sure

11:18.912 --> 11:20.748
about that.
I'm fine.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.883
It's fine, and
everything's gonna be fine.

11:22.916 --> 11:23.851
Okay?

11:23.884 --> 11:25.018
I'm so sorry.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.720
Yeah, me, too.

11:26.754 --> 11:27.888
JACKIE:
Danny?

11:27.921 --> 11:29.422
How many times do
you have to hear...?

11:29.456 --> 11:31.224
We have an officer down.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.861
As much as we we'd appreciate
your understanding

11:33.894 --> 11:36.463
and compassion
in this delicate circumstance,

11:36.496 --> 11:38.899
I realize
that is an unrealistic hope.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.968
REPORTER:
And while the commissioner
will not give

11:41.001 --> 11:41.935
details on the shooting,

11:41.969 --> 11:44.404
there is one eyewitness,
Ms. Angela Jackson,

11:44.437 --> 11:46.874
and she described
Detective Reagan as being angry

11:46.907 --> 11:49.977
and agitated
immediately before the incident.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.012
Angela, can you please
tell us what happened?

11:52.045 --> 11:53.914
Yeah. He was out of control.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.483
He was screaming at me
for no reason.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.418
And then, he was even screaming
at his partner.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.420
And then, the next thing I know,

12:00.453 --> 12:02.856
he turns around,
and he shoots the guy.

12:02.890 --> 12:06.259
I'm-I'm telling you,
he was out of control.

12:14.434 --> 12:15.302
ELWOOD:
It appears

12:15.335 --> 12:17.938
this witness, Angela
Jackson, has an axe

12:17.971 --> 12:19.106
to grind with
Detective Reagan.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.041
Be nice if one
of the hundred reporters

12:21.074 --> 12:23.343
she gave her exclusive to
did some actual reporting

12:23.376 --> 12:24.611
and dug that up.

12:24.644 --> 12:27.114
ELWOOD:
Well, other witnesses on
the street also described

12:27.147 --> 12:28.949
Detective Reagan as...

12:28.982 --> 12:30.017
being agitated.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.852
MOORE:
People who don't have an axe

12:31.885 --> 12:33.120
to grind with Detective Reagan?

12:33.153 --> 12:34.287
Yes.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.523
But this investigation

12:36.556 --> 12:37.524
is far from complete.

12:37.557 --> 12:38.959
I mean, there-there's precedence

12:38.992 --> 12:40.127
for waiting
to hear...

12:40.160 --> 12:41.294
We're not going to look

12:41.328 --> 12:42.863
for reasons not to go
by the book here.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.031
Is that clear?

12:44.064 --> 12:46.099
Yes, sir.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.801
You will conduct
a complete, thorough

12:47.835 --> 12:49.803
and impartial investigation.

12:49.837 --> 12:51.138
Thank you.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.540
Yes, sir.

12:57.010 --> 12:59.012
(sighs)

13:02.449 --> 13:04.584
You know, you're the worst
client I've ever had.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.119
Thank you.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.587
You pop off
at the hospital.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.322
The press is salivating, Frank.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.124
When do they not?

13:11.158 --> 13:12.325
I'm just saying,
it wouldn't hurt

13:12.359 --> 13:14.594
if you told the media what
you just told Captain Elwood.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.229
Wouldn't hurt you.
Might kill me.

13:16.263 --> 13:17.430
Here we go.
Here we go,

13:17.464 --> 13:19.132
what, Garrett?
Here you go,

13:19.166 --> 13:21.434
making our jobs ten times more
difficult than they have to be.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.003
You're making
the right call.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.604
The press would lap it up.
Just let 'em.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.007
No, I will not just let them.
Why the hell not?

13:27.040 --> 13:28.308
Because I don't like

13:28.341 --> 13:30.844
pandering on my best day.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.114
He's my son...

13:34.147 --> 13:36.083
Garrett.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.021
(sighs)

13:41.054 --> 13:43.857
They don't teach this stuff
at the academy.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.027
You could recuse yourself.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.405
You're gonna have to do
something, Frank.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.440
I have a credible report

14:00.473 --> 14:04.144
that a member of my department
was, quote, "out of control"

14:04.177 --> 14:07.547
just before
he shot a fellow officer.

14:07.580 --> 14:11.251
I know damn well
what I have to do.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.020
Jack? Hey.
JACKIE:
Yeah.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.422
TARU loaded up the surveillance
video from the subway platform.

14:15.455 --> 14:16.589
Oh. Anything?

14:16.623 --> 14:19.026
Oh, yeah. Come on.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.661
Take a look.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.563
Oh, what do you know?

14:23.596 --> 14:25.365
That's our guy.
Oh, yeah.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.167
We're distributing a screen-grab
of this kid's mug citywide.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.136
We find him, we find out
what Tedesco was doing.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.538
There's no train
in the station.
No.

14:31.571 --> 14:32.472
They probably came up
from the street.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.441
Ran up one staircase
and down the other one.

14:34.474 --> 14:37.044
Yeah. There's Tedesco.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.912
(sighs)

14:38.946 --> 14:39.546
You all right?

14:39.579 --> 14:41.114
Yeah.

14:42.682 --> 14:43.917
Look, you see that?

14:43.951 --> 14:45.152
Yeah.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.620
Look.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.022
Gun. Was he strapped?

14:49.056 --> 14:50.323
Not when we saw him.

14:50.357 --> 14:51.491
Watch.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.626
Look.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.930
ESU's looking
for it as we speak.

14:56.964 --> 14:57.965
Let's go help them.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.000
(mutters)

15:01.634 --> 15:03.336
Reagan.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.705
Come on, Sarge. We just
got our first break.

15:05.738 --> 15:06.673
Can it wait?

15:06.706 --> 15:08.408
No, it can't wait.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.680
Okay.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.251
What is it?

15:18.285 --> 15:20.520
You're being put
on modified assignment.

15:22.455 --> 15:23.991
What?
Word just came down

15:24.024 --> 15:25.358
from the commissioner's office.

15:25.392 --> 15:28.161
So, I'm a house mouse.

15:28.195 --> 15:30.697
Mm-hmm. You can't leave
that desk.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.501
Right.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.403
And you know what else.

15:44.744 --> 15:47.280
I'll keep 'em warm
for you, Detective.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.658
(sighs)

15:59.792 --> 16:01.995
(boat horn blowing)

16:06.766 --> 16:09.969
(boat horn blowing)

16:16.076 --> 16:18.078
(sighs)

16:19.412 --> 16:21.448
You did what
you had to do.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.017
You got nothing
to feel guilty about.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.652
What makes you think
I feel guilty?

16:25.685 --> 16:28.155
'Cause you got a
hero in that bag

16:28.188 --> 16:30.757
from Ziggy's with
my name on it.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.230
No shield, and still one
of my best detectives.

16:39.066 --> 16:41.601
How's Tedesco?

16:41.634 --> 16:43.803
He's still unconscious.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.106
How are you?

16:48.108 --> 16:50.377
We can't really talk
about it, can we?

16:50.410 --> 16:53.746
No, we can't.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.716
You ever wonder why I never
ask you to go fishing?

16:58.218 --> 17:00.620
You got the attention
span of a gnat.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.261
Remember that summer

17:08.295 --> 17:11.331
Uncle Jim offered me a job
as a telemarketer in Jersey?

17:11.364 --> 17:13.200
I am still amazed
you were able

17:13.233 --> 17:15.735
to resist the allure of
hustling aluminum siding.

17:15.768 --> 17:18.771
Yeah, that took guts.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.773
(chuckles)

17:20.807 --> 17:22.742
That was the same
summer you told me

17:22.775 --> 17:25.112
you were going to
take the cop test.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.618
Remember what I said?

17:31.651 --> 17:34.254
"Never buy aluminum siding

17:34.287 --> 17:36.756
from a company
with no fixed address"?

17:36.789 --> 17:39.159
The other thing I said.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.833
"New York's Finest
just got a little better."

17:48.868 --> 17:52.439
That's as true today
as it was then.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.542
I don't know, Dad.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.312
I do.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.720
ELWOOD
So would you

18:07.754 --> 18:10.823
say Detective Reagan
was feeling angry?

18:10.857 --> 18:13.393
No, I would not say that.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.095
I have no earthly idea
how he was feeling.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.467
Erin, we're not arguing
in front of a jury.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.570
There's no need
for you to view me as the enemy.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.305
Really, Derek?

18:25.338 --> 18:26.773
Well, it's nice to know

18:26.806 --> 18:29.209
that this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

18:29.242 --> 18:31.878
Don't forget
that I am usually

18:31.911 --> 18:33.880
the one asking the questions.

18:33.913 --> 18:37.150
Okay, let's go to it then.

18:37.184 --> 18:38.818
Did Detective Reagan
say anything

18:38.851 --> 18:40.553
to make you question
his performance

18:40.587 --> 18:42.389
as a New York City
police detective?

18:42.422 --> 18:44.257
Absolutely not.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.893
Are you sure
he never said, uh...

18:46.926 --> 18:48.428
"If you guys
won't prosecute 'em,

18:48.461 --> 18:50.163
"maybe we should just shoot 'em

18:50.197 --> 18:51.298
in the street"?

18:51.331 --> 18:53.333
Come on. He was frustrated.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.168
We had just tossed his case.

18:55.202 --> 18:56.869
He was just blowing off steam.

18:56.903 --> 18:59.539
Oh, so you could tell
he was feeling angry?

19:04.211 --> 19:06.213
Just leave it
right there, okay? Thanks.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.216
You're doing
more on modified

19:09.249 --> 19:11.318
than most of my
guys do full duty.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.520
Well, Sarge, Tedesco wasn't
chasing that guy for nothing.

19:13.553 --> 19:14.954
Been fishing through
these Sprint reports

19:14.987 --> 19:16.423
looking for any whiff
of activity

19:16.456 --> 19:18.358
within a half mile
of the incident.
And?

19:18.391 --> 19:20.593
So far,
I got an anonymous 911 caller,

19:20.627 --> 19:22.829
reported a woman screaming
ten blocks from the El

19:22.862 --> 19:24.864
where Tedesco ran into us,
18 minutes earlier.

19:24.897 --> 19:27.367
Responding officer
reported nobody was there.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.935
He closed it out, 10-90X.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.403
Okay, well,
why was nobody there, Sarge?

19:30.437 --> 19:31.671
I mean,
somebody was screaming, right?

19:31.704 --> 19:32.839
What, did she disappear?

19:32.872 --> 19:34.841
Don't you remember
patrol, Reagan?

19:34.874 --> 19:36.676
We used to get ten
of these a tour.

19:36.709 --> 19:37.910
Probably some lady
screaming because she saw

19:37.944 --> 19:40.847
a spider in the sink.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.915
Lab came back
on the gun your guy tossed.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.384
No prints of value.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.219
Great.
But...

19:46.253 --> 19:48.621
there was blood on it.

19:48.655 --> 19:51.791
They're running it now
along with ballistics.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.793
That's beautiful.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.962
You hear that, Jack?
We got...

19:55.995 --> 19:58.365
JACKIE:
Look,

19:58.398 --> 20:00.267
this woman was
giving us a hard time.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.934
Danny gave her a
hard time right back.

20:01.968 --> 20:04.471
That's how it goes on
the job. You know that.

20:04.504 --> 20:05.505
But what doesn't

20:05.538 --> 20:07.740
happen every day--
two partners getting into it

20:07.774 --> 20:09.242
in the middle of the street.

20:09.276 --> 20:13.813
Danny and I have a...
a unique... dynamic.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.014
If what you're telling me is

20:15.047 --> 20:17.550
that you and your partner
routinely scream at each other,

20:17.584 --> 20:19.386
maybe it's time
one of you get reassigned.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.987
That's not what I'm saying.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.722
Then say what you're saying.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.959
I think the issue here is
whether or not

20:26.993 --> 20:30.463
Officer Tedesco identified
himself as a police offer.

20:30.497 --> 20:31.931
And I am telling you

20:31.964 --> 20:33.566
he did not.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.001
How can you be sure?

20:35.034 --> 20:36.035
Because I was there.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.604
Yeah, you were there.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.639
You were screaming
at Detective Reagan, and

20:39.672 --> 20:41.974
he was screaming at you
and Mrs. Jackson, and all this

20:42.008 --> 20:44.544
is going on while a... a man is
running down the stairs

20:44.577 --> 20:45.978
yelling that another man
with a gun

20:46.012 --> 20:47.414
is trying to kill him?

20:47.447 --> 20:49.649
I don't think it's a stretch
that we consider

20:49.682 --> 20:54.287
the possibility that maybe,
while all this was going on,

20:54.321 --> 20:57.023
maybe Officer Tedesco did
identify himself.

20:57.056 --> 20:59.592
And maybe, just maybe,

20:59.626 --> 21:02.995
Detective Reagan was not
in the mood to listen.

21:03.029 --> 21:05.698
Captain, don't do this.

21:05.732 --> 21:08.501
We're not through yet,
Detective.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.008
Don't do this.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.810
I'm doing my job.

21:17.844 --> 21:20.046
Did Detective Reagan do his?

21:20.079 --> 21:22.582
We were at the wrong place
at the wrong time.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.953
Danny did the right thing.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.093
Hey.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.028
You still here. Good.
Yeah.

21:36.062 --> 21:37.730
Danny, this guy from I.A., I...

21:37.764 --> 21:39.532
Don't worry about him.

21:39.566 --> 21:41.801
Okay?
I'm not worried about him.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.570
You want to worry
about someone?

21:43.603 --> 21:45.538
Let's worry about
Officer Tedesco, okay?

21:45.572 --> 21:47.940
Let's worry about finding
the guy that he was chasing.

21:47.974 --> 21:50.843
Now a 911 caller said a woman
was screaming at this address.

21:50.877 --> 21:52.412
Can you go find out why?

21:57.384 --> 21:59.118
(sighs)

21:59.151 --> 22:00.787
(slams papers down)

22:00.820 --> 22:02.555
WOMAN: I don't know
anything about that.

22:02.589 --> 22:04.123
I didn't hear anything.
Well, a 911 caller

22:04.156 --> 22:07.026
said there were screams
coming from your house.

22:07.059 --> 22:09.862
(chuckles):
Maybe it was the TV.

22:09.896 --> 22:11.698
Are you sure, Mrs. Lee?

22:11.731 --> 22:13.633
This is really very important.

22:13.666 --> 22:16.469
Somebody made a mistake.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.371
Okay.

22:18.405 --> 22:20.039
Okay.

22:20.072 --> 22:22.074
Oh. You know what?

22:22.108 --> 22:23.242
My phone went dead.

22:23.275 --> 22:25.912
You know, I-I really need
to call in to close this out.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.580
Do you mind if I use your phone?

22:27.614 --> 22:29.048
I don't...
Please?
It'll just

22:29.081 --> 22:31.017
take a second--
my boss is gonna kill me

22:31.050 --> 22:32.084
if I don't finish this.

22:34.086 --> 22:35.054
Thank you.

22:35.087 --> 22:36.589
It's right...
Yeah.

22:36.623 --> 22:38.891
Um, please hurry--
I'm late for
an appointment.

22:38.925 --> 22:41.127
Yeah, it'll just take
one second.

22:42.795 --> 22:45.398
(phone ringing)

22:46.433 --> 22:48.034
Hey.

22:48.067 --> 22:49.736
Yeah. It's me.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.037
I'm in Ms. Lee's living room.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.672
Yeah, my-my cell died.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.907
You running a game?

22:54.941 --> 22:56.443
Okay, I'll hold.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.478
(sighs) So,
what were you

22:58.511 --> 22:59.779
watching last night?

22:59.812 --> 23:02.449
A movie,
or one of those talk guys?

23:02.482 --> 23:04.150
(chuckles):
I don't remember.

23:04.183 --> 23:06.052
Well, if it was
one of those talk guys,

23:06.085 --> 23:07.820
then there wouldn't be
any screaming going on,

23:07.854 --> 23:10.089
unless there's some...

23:10.122 --> 23:12.158
Oh, wow.

23:12.191 --> 23:13.960
That's a great photo.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.628
Huh.

23:15.662 --> 23:17.096
Who's in the photo with you?

23:17.129 --> 23:19.732
Uh, that's... my son.

23:24.203 --> 23:26.138
Is that also your son?

23:28.140 --> 23:29.809
Danny, we're coming in.

23:29.842 --> 23:32.178
Yeah, get her in, get her in.

23:45.925 --> 23:46.726
He used to be

23:46.759 --> 23:48.060
a good boy.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.730
(sobbing):
He was gonna
go to college.

23:50.763 --> 23:54.133
He was gonna study
hotel administration.

23:54.166 --> 23:55.735
DANNY:
Your son's not
reading too good

23:55.768 --> 23:56.936
from where we're
sitting, Mrs. Lee.

23:56.969 --> 23:59.138
Yesterday he did something
that got a police officer shot,

23:59.171 --> 24:01.474
and that police officer's
in critical condition now.

24:01.508 --> 24:03.209
It's the drugs.

24:03.242 --> 24:05.111
He's not my
Tyler anymore.

24:07.079 --> 24:08.848
I don't know who he is.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.650
So he was
at your house

24:10.683 --> 24:11.918
last night.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.786
So you were the one screaming.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.722
When he runs out
of money for drugs

24:15.755 --> 24:18.057
for him and his girlfriend,
he comes to see me.

24:18.090 --> 24:20.793
He takes money, whatever
I have that he can sell.

24:20.827 --> 24:23.162
It used to happen
every now and then,

24:23.195 --> 24:25.231
and now...
now it's all the time.

24:25.264 --> 24:27.066
So your son came
to rob you yesterday?

24:27.099 --> 24:28.901
I told him I wasn't
gonna give him

24:28.935 --> 24:30.570
another red cent.

24:30.603 --> 24:34.173
And then he pulled out a gun.

24:34.206 --> 24:36.008
On me.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.846
His own mother.

24:39.879 --> 24:41.581
And that's why you screamed.

24:41.614 --> 24:43.550
I ran out of
the house. I...

24:43.583 --> 24:45.852
I told him to shoot me.

24:45.885 --> 24:48.054
I begged him...

24:48.087 --> 24:51.858
to put me out of my misery.

24:51.891 --> 24:54.894
Then I looked in his eyes...

24:56.796 --> 24:59.699
...and there was nothing there.

24:59.732 --> 25:02.635
(sobbing): I think
he was gonna do it.

25:02.669 --> 25:05.271
And then that man came over.

25:06.305 --> 25:08.675
You mean this man?

25:13.980 --> 25:15.715
Go ahead, look at him.

25:17.884 --> 25:20.620
I didn't know he
was a police officer.

25:20.653 --> 25:22.689
He must have
seen us fighting.

25:22.722 --> 25:24.724
He came over
and told Tyler

25:24.757 --> 25:27.760
to get his hands off me,
and Tyler ran.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.732
And that man ran after him.

25:32.765 --> 25:34.834
Why didn't you call the police?

25:36.235 --> 25:38.905
(crying)

25:38.938 --> 25:41.874
He's my son.

25:45.845 --> 25:47.146
So... how was he

25:47.179 --> 25:49.148
when he left
here yesterday?

25:49.181 --> 25:50.950
Uh...

25:50.983 --> 25:53.653
he was normal.

25:53.686 --> 25:55.054
Normal.

25:55.087 --> 25:57.189
We're hearing that he was
unusually tense yesterday,

25:57.223 --> 26:00.192
and we're just wondering...
when that started.

26:00.226 --> 26:01.894
(laughs)

26:03.229 --> 26:05.197
Danny is an intense guy.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.866
Yeah.
He loves the job,

26:06.899 --> 26:08.768
and that's where
he puts his energy--

26:08.801 --> 26:10.202
plus me and the boys.

26:10.236 --> 26:11.938
Right.

26:11.971 --> 26:14.306
So yesterday
there was nothing unusual.

26:14.340 --> 26:15.775
Well, he left his dish
on the counter.

26:15.808 --> 26:17.644
(laughs):
That's plenty usual.

26:19.011 --> 26:20.813
And then what happened?

26:20.847 --> 26:22.281
Then he went to work.

26:26.819 --> 26:28.721
Okay.

26:28.755 --> 26:30.957
I see. Well, thank you very
much for your hospitality.

26:30.990 --> 26:32.058
It's much appreciated.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.826
I'm just curious.

26:33.860 --> 26:34.861
How did that...

26:34.894 --> 26:37.764
vase get broken?

26:52.044 --> 26:54.013
Then he saw that vase.

26:54.046 --> 26:56.749
I told him it
was an accident,
but I don't know,

26:56.783 --> 26:59.719
I think he got
the wrong idea.
You did the right thing, Linda.

26:59.752 --> 27:01.754
Don't worry about it.
(sighs)
"The right thing."

27:01.788 --> 27:04.256
I don't even know
what that is anymore.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.792
You know?

27:05.825 --> 27:08.661
I'm sorry,
but... the years

27:08.695 --> 27:09.829
that you've given
this department,

27:09.862 --> 27:11.864
the sacrifices that
you've made, the...

27:11.898 --> 27:13.933
the toll that it's taken on...

27:13.966 --> 27:15.702
on us and the kids,

27:15.735 --> 27:17.804
and this is the thanks we get.

27:17.837 --> 27:19.806
Being railroaded by some guy.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.307
Babe, he's I.A., okay?

27:21.340 --> 27:23.342
That's what they do.

27:25.377 --> 27:28.214
It's not right.

27:30.016 --> 27:32.885
Someone could
damn well tell him so.

27:36.088 --> 27:37.924
Someone?

27:39.325 --> 27:43.295
Would it be the end of the world
if he stepped in?

27:45.031 --> 27:46.165
(sighs)

27:46.198 --> 27:49.101
It may not make a lot of sense,

27:49.135 --> 27:52.204
and it may hurt
like hell to hear it,

27:52.238 --> 27:54.240
but yes...

27:54.273 --> 27:56.909
it would be
the end of the world.

27:56.943 --> 27:58.911
(sighs)

28:00.847 --> 28:03.716
I know.

28:03.750 --> 28:06.052
I know.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.722
It's gonna be all right.

28:19.431 --> 28:22.434
(siren wailing in distance)

28:28.941 --> 28:31.978
(phone ringing)

28:32.011 --> 28:34.013
(sighs)

28:34.046 --> 28:35.181
Hey.

28:35.214 --> 28:38.484
You're up. Well, I was going
to leave a message, but...

28:38.517 --> 28:40.186
What do you got?

28:40.219 --> 28:42.421
Well, the blood came back
on Tyler Lee's gun,

28:42.454 --> 28:44.190
and it's Officer Tedesco's.

28:44.223 --> 28:46.392
Tedesco?
How could that be?

28:46.425 --> 28:48.160
But wait, it gets better.

28:48.194 --> 28:51.463
Ballistics matches the gun to
a liquor store holdup last week.

28:51.497 --> 28:53.866
Robber shot and killed
the owner.

28:53.900 --> 28:54.901
Looks like our Tyler Lee

28:54.934 --> 28:56.502
is a murderer.

28:56.535 --> 28:58.304
(vehicle passing)

28:58.337 --> 28:59.271
Where are you?

28:59.305 --> 29:00.773
Home.

29:00.807 --> 29:02.108
Danny.

29:02.141 --> 29:04.310
Look, don't freak out,
all right?

29:04.343 --> 29:06.979
I'm sitting on Mrs. Lee's house.

29:07.013 --> 29:08.080
Are you out of your mind?

29:08.114 --> 29:09.548
I said, don't freak out.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.050
Well, it's too late, Danny.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.819
Seriously?
You're modified.

29:12.852 --> 29:14.420
If they catch you out there,
you're gonna be

29:14.453 --> 29:15.822
suspended or worse.

29:15.855 --> 29:17.523
I know, I know,
but I was thinking,

29:17.556 --> 29:19.225
Tyler didn't get
the money last time

29:19.258 --> 29:21.227
he came home, which means
he's probably gonna come back.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.995
And when he does,
he's gonna find

29:23.029 --> 29:23.996
an old friend waiting for him.

29:24.030 --> 29:25.965
No, he's not. You need
to get out of there now.

29:25.998 --> 29:28.067
Oh, come on, Jack,
five more minutes.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.135
Danny.

29:29.168 --> 29:30.136
Okay, fine.

29:30.169 --> 29:31.971
Listen, I'm starting my car.

29:32.004 --> 29:34.106
(engine starts)
You hear that? Okay, and now

29:34.140 --> 29:35.942
I'm driving away.

29:35.975 --> 29:38.010
All right,
I'll call you tomorrow.

29:40.012 --> 29:42.214
(turns off engine)

29:42.248 --> 29:43.482
(sighs)

29:43.515 --> 29:46.085
(vehicle approaching)

29:46.118 --> 29:48.120
(siren chirps)

29:49.221 --> 29:51.190
(other engine turns off)
(groans)

29:53.893 --> 29:56.495
OFFICER (over speaker): Put your
hands where we can see them.

29:56.528 --> 29:59.198
(groans)

29:59.231 --> 30:01.233
Sir, step out
the car.

30:02.935 --> 30:06.172
Look, it's okay, guys--
I'm on the job.
We got a call

30:06.205 --> 30:07.974
about a suspicious car
in the neighborhood.

30:08.007 --> 30:09.141
Can we see
your shield?

30:11.410 --> 30:14.881
I don't have it.

30:21.988 --> 30:24.323
Tom Julien from
the two-nine called.

30:24.356 --> 30:27.159
Two of his people
picked up Danny

30:27.193 --> 30:30.496
out on the street,
and he was working the case.

30:30.529 --> 30:32.131
What'd you tell Tom to do?

30:32.164 --> 30:35.134
His job.

30:42.341 --> 30:45.077
(sighs)

30:49.381 --> 30:51.450
*

31:25.051 --> 31:27.553
Can you pass the corn, please?

31:29.221 --> 31:31.257
Do I have to eat this?

31:31.290 --> 31:32.058
Yes.

31:32.091 --> 31:36.128
Grandpa? Are you
gonna fire my dad?

31:36.162 --> 31:37.063
Sean.

31:38.330 --> 31:40.032
I'm sorry, Frank.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.203
No, I'm not.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.338
I think it's wrong

31:46.372 --> 31:50.076
to punish Danny
for doing his job.

31:53.279 --> 31:55.447
I mean, I get it--
Uncle Danny

31:55.481 --> 31:57.716
shouldn't have been
out on the street, but...

31:57.749 --> 31:59.151
his intentions were good.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.689
Cop to cop, Dad, I think Danny's
earned a little leeway here.

32:03.722 --> 32:06.258
HENRY: Francis,
in my day,

32:06.292 --> 32:08.194
we probably turned
the other way too often

32:08.227 --> 32:10.496
when it came to one of our own.

32:10.529 --> 32:12.264
But sometimes

32:12.298 --> 32:15.201
it was the right thing to do.

32:15.234 --> 32:17.536
Being held to the same standard
as everyone else is one thing,

32:17.569 --> 32:20.372
but it does feel like Danny's
being held to a higher one.

32:20.406 --> 32:23.342
You're damn straight he is.

32:25.111 --> 32:28.280
When I coached you in softball
or you boys in hoops,

32:28.314 --> 32:30.316
I always held you
to a higher standard

32:30.349 --> 32:32.218
because you're capable
of meeting it,

32:32.251 --> 32:35.587
and because you are...
I expect it.

32:35.621 --> 32:38.224
Danny, I don't think
there's a cop

32:38.257 --> 32:40.459
at this table--
not your grandpa,

32:40.492 --> 32:42.228
not me, not Jamie--

32:42.261 --> 32:44.696
who wouldn't have made
the same decision you did

32:44.730 --> 32:47.266
in that split second.

32:48.800 --> 32:52.671
But he worked the street
without a shield.

32:52.704 --> 32:56.142
And it can't
matter why.

32:56.175 --> 32:59.478
And it shouldn't matter
that he's my son.

33:11.557 --> 33:13.459
He's right.

33:14.760 --> 33:17.196
Dad's right.

33:17.229 --> 33:19.398
Orders are orders,

33:19.431 --> 33:22.168
and every cop ought to know it.

33:25.704 --> 33:28.074
I was out of line.

33:34.746 --> 33:37.516
I raised your father
the way he raised all of you--

33:37.549 --> 33:40.652
to know the difference
between right and wrong.

33:40.686 --> 33:44.290
Never thought I'd be
almost sorry I did.

33:47.593 --> 33:49.361
What's bothering you?

33:50.429 --> 33:52.198
Nothing.

33:52.231 --> 33:55.401
Hey. Don't think
I still can't sweat a guy.

33:59.338 --> 34:01.307
I made this robbery collar.

34:01.340 --> 34:04.776
Took this guy out with my asp--
he never saw it coming.

34:04.810 --> 34:06.478
What's going on?

34:08.580 --> 34:10.616
Renzulli wasn't
too happy about it,

34:10.649 --> 34:12.651
because I didn't draw my weapon.

34:12.684 --> 34:14.753
This perp was armed?

34:15.821 --> 34:19.158
No. But, well, we thought
he might have been.

34:19.191 --> 34:21.693
Turns out it was just
his hand in his pocket.

34:21.727 --> 34:24.330
Well, then you're lucky you were
riding with Renzulli and not me.

34:24.363 --> 34:25.797
I would've knocked
your teeth in.

34:25.831 --> 34:28.367
The guy wasn't armed.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.436
Why did you hesitate?

34:32.404 --> 34:33.772
Come on, Jamie.

34:33.805 --> 34:37.609
What if I hesitated to draw
for the wrong reason?

34:37.643 --> 34:39.345
Two cops, two Reagan cops,

34:39.378 --> 34:41.380
involved in a shooting
in the same week?

34:41.413 --> 34:43.682
You're thinking like a lawyer.

34:43.715 --> 34:45.884
Look, you're coming
into your own,

34:45.917 --> 34:47.453
as a cop.

34:47.486 --> 34:49.288
You're improvising, that's good.

34:49.321 --> 34:51.457
But when you're out on the job,

34:51.490 --> 34:54.426
you can't be thinking
about what your brother did

34:54.460 --> 34:55.761
or who your father is.

34:55.794 --> 34:57.463
You do your job.

34:57.496 --> 34:59.698
Understand?

34:59.731 --> 35:01.400
Yes, Grandpa.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.402
Like they used to
tell us at the academy,

35:03.435 --> 35:05.837
better you should have
to explain to the D.A.

35:05.871 --> 35:08.274
why you shot a guy
than have someone

35:08.307 --> 35:10.742
have to explain to your family
why you didn't.

35:10.776 --> 35:14.146
FRANK:
Grandpa's right, son.

35:14.180 --> 35:15.614
Better to be judged

35:15.647 --> 35:18.617
by 12 than carried by six.

35:20.386 --> 35:24.223
We're most proud of you
when you come home safe.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.296
DANNY: Hey,
what's going on?

35:30.329 --> 35:32.664
I picked up your stakeout
where you left off.

35:32.698 --> 35:35.434
Seems like Tyler did
go back to Mommy again.

35:35.467 --> 35:38.404
You got him?
No. He sent a messenger,
his better half.

35:38.437 --> 35:41.139
Meet Lydia Pepper,
Tyler's girlfriend.

35:51.650 --> 35:52.818
LYDIA:
How many times do you need

35:52.851 --> 35:55.287
to hear it?
I don't know where Tyler is.

35:55.321 --> 35:57.623
You do know where he
is, because he sent you
to his mother's house

35:57.656 --> 35:59.625
to go pick up clothes.
No. No.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.527
This boyfriend
of yours, he must be

36:01.560 --> 36:02.761
some charmer, huh?

36:02.794 --> 36:04.796
He pulls a gun
on his own mother,

36:04.830 --> 36:06.765
and then he sends
his little girlfriend in

36:06.798 --> 36:08.667
to fight his own battles--
and you're still

36:08.700 --> 36:10.702
sitting here protecting him?

36:10.736 --> 36:12.304
Look, I told you,
he keeps moving around.

36:12.338 --> 36:14.473
When he wants me, he finds me.
DANNY:
Come on, Lydia.

36:14.506 --> 36:16.675
We can tell you been
getting high so long

36:16.708 --> 36:18.310
that you're numb
to the outside world.

36:18.344 --> 36:19.978
But I also think

36:20.011 --> 36:22.314
that deep down there's
still someone who knows

36:22.348 --> 36:23.949
what it means
to do the right thing.

36:23.982 --> 36:25.617
There is
a police officer

36:25.651 --> 36:28.220
on life support right now
because of

36:28.254 --> 36:29.555
what Tyler did.

36:29.588 --> 36:31.357
His name is Lou Tedesco.

36:31.390 --> 36:33.359
He's got a wife

36:33.392 --> 36:34.960
and a little boy

36:34.993 --> 36:36.862
and a baby on the way. Hey.

36:36.895 --> 36:38.297
Look at his picture.

36:38.330 --> 36:39.231
Look at the picture.

36:39.265 --> 36:40.699
Look at the picture!

36:42.534 --> 36:44.970
There's no running away from
this one, you understand me?

36:45.003 --> 36:47.739
You could smoke every rock in
this city, but you will not get

36:47.773 --> 36:49.275
this one off of your conscience.

36:53.345 --> 36:54.913
It's all her fault.

36:54.946 --> 36:55.914
What?

36:57.182 --> 36:59.918
If she just did what Tyler said,
none of this would've happened.

36:59.951 --> 37:02.354
Wait a minute, who are
we talking about here, Lydia?

37:05.357 --> 37:08.660
Tyler's mother, Mrs. Lee.

37:08.694 --> 37:10.762
Why didn't she just
give us the money?

37:10.796 --> 37:11.963
So you were there.

37:12.998 --> 37:15.000
Across the street.

37:16.368 --> 37:18.304
What happened?

37:18.337 --> 37:22.007
She and Tyler were on the stoop
yelling at each other.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.809
She wouldn't give him anything,

37:23.842 --> 37:25.043
and Tyler was
losing it.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.845
He starts grabbing
her, and suddenly

37:26.878 --> 37:29.348
this guy steps in
and tries to break it up.

37:29.381 --> 37:30.516
This guy,
Officer Tedesco?

37:30.549 --> 37:32.784
He grabs Tyler and
tries to put him

37:32.818 --> 37:34.620
up against the wall--
that's when Mrs. Lee

37:34.653 --> 37:36.855
grabbed Tyler's gun
and whacked him over the head.

37:36.888 --> 37:39.825
And Tyler and the guy
took off running.
Wait a minute.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.693
Mrs. Lee grabbed a gun and...

37:41.727 --> 37:44.296
and-and whacked Officer
Tedesco in the head?

37:44.330 --> 37:45.497
Yeah.

37:45.531 --> 37:46.865
Hard?

37:46.898 --> 37:50.669
When he ran off, he was
stumbling like he was drunk.

37:53.439 --> 37:55.006
(sighs)

37:55.040 --> 37:57.309
I'm gonna go make a call.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.954
ELWOOD:
Detective Reagan's mental state
at the time of the shooting

38:08.987 --> 38:10.956
appears to have been
a negative factor

38:10.989 --> 38:12.891
in his decision making.

38:12.924 --> 38:16.528
ButI have received
some new information

38:16.562 --> 38:19.431
this morning that will shed
light on the circumstances

38:19.465 --> 38:20.466
of the shooting.

38:20.499 --> 38:22.634
Please enlighten us.

38:22.668 --> 38:25.404
ELWOOD:
Officer Tedesco was
struck in the head

38:25.437 --> 38:27.406
with the suspect's gun
at the start of the incident.

38:27.439 --> 38:28.607
Now, that would account

38:28.640 --> 38:31.443
for the head trauma
that hadbeen attributed

38:31.477 --> 38:34.079
to his fall down the stairs
after he was shot.
He received

38:34.112 --> 38:35.981
that blow beforethe foot chase?

38:36.014 --> 38:38.083
Well, his doctors are surprised
he was able to walk,

38:38.116 --> 38:39.651
let alone identify himself

38:39.685 --> 38:42.354
as a police officer--
which supports

38:42.388 --> 38:44.490
Detective Reagan's testimony.

38:44.523 --> 38:47.926
And does any of that excuse
Detective Reagan's violation

38:47.959 --> 38:49.961
of his modified status?
All due respect,

38:49.995 --> 38:51.897
sir, that's not my call.

38:51.930 --> 38:54.600
No, Captain. It's mine.

39:04.610 --> 39:07.513
We had a team on Tyler
Lee's girlfriend all night.

39:07.546 --> 39:09.581
He never showed. Now
Curatola's tailing her,

39:09.615 --> 39:11.717
thinking she may be
headed for a meet.

39:11.750 --> 39:13.619
She could use
some backup.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.387
Why are you
telling me, Sarge?

39:15.421 --> 39:18.424
Can't you see I'm busy
sharpening pencils?
Oh.

39:18.457 --> 39:19.625
Did I forget to mention?

39:19.658 --> 39:21.493
You've been restored
to full duty.

39:23.895 --> 39:24.963
Congratulations.

39:26.031 --> 39:27.866
(sighs)

39:31.202 --> 39:33.805
(exhales)

39:44.049 --> 39:46.184
Heard you need
a little backup.

39:46.217 --> 39:50.422
Oh. Look who got out of
the penalty box again.

39:50.456 --> 39:53.391
Yep. Except now,
it's official.

39:54.493 --> 39:56.194
JACKIE:
I kind of liked you

39:56.227 --> 39:58.430
in the office, you know.
Oh, you like
my coffee, huh?

39:58.464 --> 39:59.765
Yes, exactly.

39:59.798 --> 40:01.600
It's always
nice and hot.

40:03.502 --> 40:05.437
You think she made us?
No.

40:05.471 --> 40:07.439
No sense taking
any chances, though.

40:07.473 --> 40:09.174
Gonna give her a little space.

40:09.207 --> 40:11.176
What, is she texting again?

40:11.209 --> 40:13.445
DANNY:
You think she's trying
to get in contact with Tyler?

40:13.479 --> 40:15.146
Yeah, the first ten
times I thought so,

40:15.180 --> 40:17.716
but now I just think she's
got more friends than me.

40:23.021 --> 40:24.656
There he is.

40:24.690 --> 40:26.191
JACKIE: Oh...
DANNY:
Grab her.

40:26.224 --> 40:28.827
I'm on him.
Yeah.

40:32.531 --> 40:33.765
Hey!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

40:33.799 --> 40:36.301
DANNY:
Get out of the way! Hold on!

40:40.171 --> 40:41.507
Move!

40:45.811 --> 40:48.079
Hey!

40:48.113 --> 40:50.582
(tires screech)

40:50.616 --> 40:51.983
Come here!

40:53.919 --> 40:55.921
Come here, come here!

40:58.056 --> 41:00.759
You still looking for
the police, dirtbag? Huh?

41:00.792 --> 41:02.894
Guess what?
I'm right here.

41:08.734 --> 41:11.102
(handcuffs clicking)

41:13.705 --> 41:16.141
So, the doctors said they
had never seen a patient

41:16.174 --> 41:18.243
fight their way back
the way you did.

41:18.276 --> 41:20.045
And I said,
"What do you expect?

41:20.078 --> 41:21.747
He comes out of the six-five."

41:23.114 --> 41:24.750
Your old house.

41:24.783 --> 41:28.854
I see they taught you the job
the same way they taught me.

41:30.088 --> 41:33.024
No retreat, no surrender.

41:33.058 --> 41:35.561
Get well.

41:35.594 --> 41:38.496
Get back on the street;
do us proud.

41:39.330 --> 41:40.766
Yes, sir.

41:40.799 --> 41:43.068
(knocking at door)

41:52.578 --> 41:54.946
I see you have another visitor.

42:04.590 --> 42:06.592
(sighs)

42:14.099 --> 42:16.735
Good thing I'm not a great shot.
