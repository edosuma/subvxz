00:05.920 --> 00:08.440
Kayla has been
a stupid girl.

00:08.520 --> 00:11.400
Why else would she
send naked pictures to boys?

00:16.360 --> 00:18.800
Saban died in 1994.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.640
Karl: Think we'll
be able to dig out

00:20.720 --> 00:22.080
the death certificate?

00:22.160 --> 00:23.320
I'm sure Philippe can.

Ooh!

I got to go to France.

Now?
Mm-hmm.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.120
I may not
be back tonight,

02:50.200 --> 02:51.680
so you need to stay
with your mum, ok?

02:51.704 --> 02:53.520
I'm gonna call her,
let her know.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.920
It's fine. I'll do it.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.240
And then we need to have
a chat when I get back.

03:00.320 --> 03:02.360
About what?

03:02.440 --> 03:04.240
About you, what's
going on with you.

03:04.320 --> 03:07.160
Nothing's going on with me.

03:07.240 --> 03:08.960
Mm-hmm.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.720
Well, Elise seems to
think there is,

03:10.775 --> 03:13.056
and you weren't very nice to
your nan yesterday, were you?

03:13.080 --> 03:14.760
She's decided to
move back home.

03:14.840 --> 03:16.960
I said sorry to Nana c.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.160
Hmm.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.360
Maybe Elise should keep
her nose out

03:20.440 --> 03:22.040
of other people's business.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.560
I have to get ready.

03:24.640 --> 03:25.840
Why?

03:25.920 --> 03:27.560
I'm meeting someone
before school.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.560
Who?

03:29.640 --> 03:30.840
Kayla.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.760
She's quite a lot older
than you, isn't she?

03:35.840 --> 03:37.360
She's gonna be into stuff
that you're

03:37.440 --> 03:39.040
not really ready for.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.800
Maybe you're not ready
for me to grow up.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.480
Phone your mother.

03:59.680 --> 04:01.280
Hello.

04:07.120 --> 04:08.120
Are you ok?

04:08.160 --> 04:09.800
Shall I call the nurse?

04:09.880 --> 04:11.360
No.

04:11.440 --> 04:13.080
Do you want some
painkillers or something?

04:13.120 --> 04:14.840
I've never felt better.

04:17.560 --> 04:19.959
There's no point in us
both being here.

04:22.800 --> 04:25.200
I'm sure chaput needs you
more than I do.

05:01.360 --> 05:04.120
Elise, it's me again.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.920
Uh, I really screwed up.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.360
I'm sorry you're suspended.

05:08.440 --> 05:10.080
I'm sorry I called
Olivier.

05:10.160 --> 05:11.880
I didn't think for
a second that he'd be

05:11.960 --> 05:16.720
such a... twat as to tell
fucking chaput,

05:16.800 --> 05:19.280
but there we are.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.320
We both get fuck-up
of the year.

05:25.560 --> 05:31.040
I, uh, ha ha... I feel like
Ronnie corbett must've felt

05:31.120 --> 05:33.360
after Ronnie barker left.

05:33.440 --> 05:37.320
Um, don't know who that is,
do you?

05:40.600 --> 05:44.120
What I'm trying to say is
that I... I...

05:44.200 --> 05:49.840
I need you, uh, with...

05:52.200 --> 05:54.280
Fuck!

05:54.360 --> 05:57.760
Is that it?
Is that all I get?

06:24.680 --> 06:26.640
Boy: Nah. No one else.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.280
She was going home.
She was fine...

06:28.360 --> 06:29.760
Police woman: Through here?

06:29.840 --> 06:31.800
Boy: No she was
over there...

06:31.880 --> 06:33.400
Different boy:
Is she all right...

06:43.040 --> 06:44.720
Hello.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.760
Hello.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.800
Bonjour. How are
we getting on?

08:45.640 --> 08:47.040
You're too fast
for me.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.800
No. Oh, my god.
This is so grotty.

08:49.880 --> 08:51.280
Oh, my gosh. You're
so good at this.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.080
I know.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.200
Ok. Ok. 1...

08:55.280 --> 08:57.360
2.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.080
I'm really good at
this. Not this.

08:59.160 --> 09:00.480
So what do you see?

09:00.560 --> 09:02.520
You have more than
I have. Please!

09:02.600 --> 09:03.800
Mm-mm.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.000
I'm gonna push you
off, then.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.640
Saban doesn't
have a grave.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.720
We checked.

09:17.800 --> 09:21.400
Death records, burials,
cremations.

09:21.480 --> 09:24.400
He's not dead, is he?

09:24.480 --> 09:26.560
I've told you all
I know.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.560
Must've been very
difficult...

09:33.400 --> 09:35.800
Working with those children,

09:35.880 --> 09:38.120
dealing with
all that damage.

09:38.200 --> 09:41.560
Huh. You have no idea
what it was like

09:41.640 --> 09:43.600
with children
like saban.

09:43.680 --> 09:46.120
Watching their own
family slaughtered

09:46.200 --> 09:48.960
in the streets.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.800
No one cared.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.960
No one did a thing
to help

09:55.040 --> 09:56.600
until we came along.

09:58.440 --> 10:00.160
We reunited families.

10:00.240 --> 10:04.080
We gave those who had
been orphaned a future.

10:04.160 --> 10:07.160
But you didn't reunite
saban with his family,

10:07.240 --> 10:08.400
did you?

10:08.480 --> 10:11.680
They died in Bosnia.

10:17.160 --> 10:19.240
The thing is...

10:19.320 --> 10:22.800
Saban's mother
is still alive.

10:22.880 --> 10:28.440
And she's been searching
for her son all these years.

10:31.280 --> 10:33.040
Can you tell me where he is?

10:38.360 --> 10:41.200
I've told you.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.120
That boy is dead.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.040
Edith's visitors.

11:03.360 --> 11:04.840
To get to her age

11:04.920 --> 11:08.120
and still have
so many friends.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.040
Jean-Marc sargent.

11:10.120 --> 11:12.720
He's her most
regular visitor.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.480
She must be very
good liar.

11:22.680 --> 11:23.880
What?

11:27.720 --> 11:29.840
Whatever you think,
I've got Elise's back.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.640
I may have done
the wrong thing,

11:31.720 --> 11:33.400
but I did it for the right
fucking reasons.

11:42.320 --> 11:44.280
Bring the book.

11:44.360 --> 11:49.280
Ok. I bring the book.

14:28.520 --> 14:29.600
Bonjour.

14:29.680 --> 14:32.080
Bonjour.

14:34.560 --> 14:37.880
Ah. Um, oui. Um...

14:42.440 --> 14:45.320
Police.
Ok.

14:46.520 --> 14:48.520
Jean-Marc sargent.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.640
Yes. He's my father.

14:50.720 --> 14:52.240
Can I help you?

14:52.320 --> 14:55.280
Uh, um...

14:59.800 --> 15:01.920
Yeah. Should I call him?

15:03.840 --> 15:05.960
Bonjour. I'm
Jean-Marc sargent.

15:13.760 --> 15:16.400
Francois: Ok.

15:39.400 --> 15:43.600
Um...

16:03.800 --> 16:05.720
Calais every month.

16:05.800 --> 16:08.800
Um...

16:08.880 --> 16:10.280
What's the...
What's the connection?

16:34.160 --> 16:36.600
Should we sit down?

16:45.760 --> 16:47.200
He doesn't know.

16:47.280 --> 16:49.640
No.

16:49.720 --> 16:51.400
It's, um...

16:58.000 --> 17:01.320
Um, your son,
we need his help.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.000
Um...

17:05.440 --> 17:08.599
It's important that you
tell him the truth now,

17:08.680 --> 17:11.839
the, uh... the verite.

17:26.200 --> 17:30.440
My wife died,
and...

17:36.480 --> 17:40.440
I promised to her to... nev...

17:41.760 --> 17:45.440
N... never tell him.

17:45.520 --> 17:49.640
Please. Please.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.840
I promise to her

17:51.920 --> 17:55.320
to not say to francois.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.160
I can't.

17:57.240 --> 17:59.240
It's my son.

17:59.320 --> 18:01.360
You understand?

18:01.440 --> 18:03.240
I know you love him,
right? It's very clear.

18:03.320 --> 18:05.640
This is very difficult.

18:05.720 --> 18:07.080
Please.

18:08.360 --> 18:09.640
Please.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.520
Elise, I found him.
I found saban.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.880
He's alive.

18:46.840 --> 18:48.080
I don't know what
to do. Uh...

18:48.160 --> 18:50.320
I need your help.

18:52.560 --> 18:55.520
Oh, god. Is this crazy?
Call me, will you?

19:34.600 --> 19:35.920
Bonjour.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.160
Bonjour.

20:00.840 --> 20:02.200
Elise?

21:40.040 --> 21:44.160
Karl on answering machine:
Elise, it's me again...

21:44.240 --> 21:46.480
Karl: Oh.
Ok. Continue.

21:49.880 --> 21:52.000
Karl on answering machine:
I'm sorry I called Olivier.

21:52.080 --> 21:53.640
I didn't think for
a second that he'd be

21:53.680 --> 21:57.560
such a... twat as to tell
fucking chaput,

21:57.640 --> 22:01.760
but... we both get fuck-up
of the year.

22:01.840 --> 22:07.680
I, uh, ha ha... I feel like
Ronnie corbett must've felt

22:07.760 --> 22:09.080
after Ronnie barker left.

22:09.160 --> 22:10.760
Do we have to
listen to this?

22:10.840 --> 22:12.560
Yes, we do.

22:12.640 --> 22:16.000
Karl on answering machine: Um,
don't know who that is, do you?

22:16.080 --> 22:19.280
What I'm trying to say is
that I... I...

22:19.360 --> 22:22.800
I need you, uh, with...

22:27.760 --> 22:30.080
It sounds like it was
quite an argument you had.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.200
What's he saying?

23:03.280 --> 23:04.960
He's threatening her.

23:13.616 --> 23:14.616
Come on!

23:14.640 --> 23:15.760
Olivier: Wait.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.400
Woman on recording:
Nouveau message.

23:21.480 --> 23:22.800
Karl: Come on.
Let's bring him in.

23:22.824 --> 23:24.224
Olivier:
Wait. Wait. Wait.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.400
Ok. Let's go.
Let's go.

23:46.680 --> 23:47.800
Hiya.

23:47.880 --> 23:49.000
Here you are.

23:51.880 --> 23:53.000
Oh, thank you.
That's it.

23:53.080 --> 23:54.400
There you are.
See you later, eh?

23:54.480 --> 23:55.600
Thank you very much.
See you.

23:55.624 --> 23:57.144
Take care.

24:23.800 --> 24:25.000
Hello.

24:25.080 --> 24:27.280
Hey. What time will
you be home?

24:27.360 --> 24:30.320
About 6:00-ish.
You ok?

24:30.400 --> 24:33.080
Yeah, I'm good.
Talk to you later, yeah?

26:06.080 --> 26:07.560
Excusez-moi.

27:33.680 --> 27:34.800
How are you?

27:34.880 --> 27:36.040
All right.

27:42.080 --> 27:43.480
Health and fucking
safety might bore

27:43.504 --> 27:44.640
the tits off you...

27:44.720 --> 27:46.440
It certainly
bores the tits off me...

27:46.520 --> 27:48.520
But you keel over in
this office,

27:48.600 --> 27:49.720
and I'm responsible.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.000
I'm fine.

27:58.280 --> 28:01.000
Well, you look like shit.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.640
You should clearly
still be in hospital,

28:03.720 --> 28:06.120
but I can see you won't
be persuaded to go back.

28:06.200 --> 28:07.840
I'm responsible for
why Lana got away,

28:07.920 --> 28:11.320
and now Elise is missing,
so Karl needs my help.

28:11.400 --> 28:13.040
Keep your ass in that
chair until I've had

28:13.064 --> 28:15.560
occupational health liaise
with the hospital.

28:15.640 --> 28:19.440
They say you're fit to work,
you do it from this desk.

28:19.520 --> 28:21.360
Understood?

28:21.440 --> 28:23.680
Understood.

28:50.360 --> 28:52.080
What about the fish
factory where he worked?

28:52.104 --> 28:53.880
Where's that?

28:53.960 --> 28:55.360
Olivier?

28:55.440 --> 28:57.080
Yeah. Sorry. Uh, it's
on the dock.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.320
Right.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.400
Take the first on
the right.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.480
Jacques?

30:01.720 --> 30:02.760
Karl, don't!

30:02.840 --> 30:04.880
Don't...

30:04.960 --> 30:06.160
Where is she?!

30:06.240 --> 30:08.120
What have you done to her?

30:08.200 --> 30:09.200
Karl, come on.
Get off.

30:09.280 --> 30:11.240
Where is she?

30:22.720 --> 30:24.240
Excuse me.

30:24.320 --> 30:26.400
Oh, yes, sir.

30:26.480 --> 30:28.400
Would you mind if I
used your telephone?

31:57.360 --> 31:58.920
Hmm?

32:13.200 --> 32:14.920
What have you done to her?!

33:26.520 --> 33:27.760
I'd like to report

33:27.840 --> 33:29.520
a missing person,
please.

33:29.600 --> 33:32.680
My wife, Lilian.

33:32.760 --> 33:36.040
Ok, we'll just take some
information from you,

33:36.120 --> 33:37.640
and then I'll pass it
on to my boss.

33:37.720 --> 33:39.000
And I'll just...

33:40.520 --> 33:43.640
I can't be without
her, you see?

33:43.720 --> 33:45.800
I can't.

34:51.600 --> 34:54.679
Men: ♪ stood beneath
the lamp like ♪

34:58.240 --> 34:59.880
♪ a stranger ♪

36:13.600 --> 36:15.920
Hello?

36:46.160 --> 36:47.800
Hello?

36:49.800 --> 36:53.200
Delivery. Hello?

37:30.680 --> 37:32.240
Jade?

37:38.080 --> 37:41.040
Jade, can you hear me?

37:56.320 --> 37:57.400
Jade: Hello?

37:57.480 --> 37:59.240
Jade!
Aah!

37:59.320 --> 38:01.280
Jade?!

38:12.320 --> 38:13.640
Hi. This is Jade.

38:13.720 --> 38:15.200
Please leave a message
after the tone.

38:16.280 --> 38:17.200
Jade!

38:17.280 --> 38:19.440
Jade!

38:37.760 --> 38:39.920
I really thought he
loved me.

38:43.760 --> 38:46.080
Well...

38:46.160 --> 38:47.560
He didn't.

38:47.640 --> 38:49.560
But you still
got me.

38:51.760 --> 38:52.880
Lezzer.

38:59.960 --> 39:01.840
Here we go.

39:04.880 --> 39:07.120
Hmm?
Oi.

39:07.200 --> 39:09.440
It's not
worth addressing.

39:09.520 --> 39:12.120
Who do you think you are

39:12.200 --> 39:13.640
posting all of
this shit online?

39:13.720 --> 39:14.960
Don't know what you're
on about.

39:15.040 --> 39:16.320
I've got pictures, too,
you know?

39:16.344 --> 39:17.360
What is wrong with you?

39:17.440 --> 39:18.656
Maya: There's nothing
wrong with her.

39:18.680 --> 39:20.160
You're the one
that should be ashamed.

39:20.240 --> 39:21.400
Back off,
little girl.

39:21.480 --> 39:24.360
Kayla,
I ain't done this.

39:24.440 --> 39:25.720
And the only other
person

39:25.800 --> 39:27.440
with those pictures
is you.

39:27.520 --> 39:29.560
If you wanted my
attention,

39:29.640 --> 39:31.360
there are
other ways.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.360
Let's go.

39:45.400 --> 39:48.160
Now I need to get
really fucked.

40:23.840 --> 40:25.640
Fuck off home, borowski.

40:25.720 --> 40:27.240
You're making the place
look untidy.

40:27.320 --> 40:28.560
Yeah, I would do, boss,

40:28.640 --> 40:30.440
but I think you should
have a look at this.

40:36.360 --> 40:37.800
Well, they're
missing person reports.

40:37.824 --> 40:38.640
Mm-hmm.

40:38.720 --> 40:39.960
Three people have gone
missing

40:40.040 --> 40:42.080
in a 5-mile radius since
this morning.

42:02.080 --> 42:04.120
Kayla.

42:08.160 --> 42:09.920
Kayla?

42:20.040 --> 42:21.880
Kayla?

42:33.160 --> 42:34.560
Kayla?

42:36.400 --> 42:37.920
Kayla?

42:38.000 --> 42:39.360
Kay... Kayla?

42:41.600 --> 42:43.480
Kayla... oh, my gosh.
Kayla? Kayla?

42:43.560 --> 42:46.120
Kayla? Kayla?
Oh, my god.

42:46.200 --> 42:47.200
Kayla, please!

42:47.240 --> 42:49.280
Kayla, please!

42:49.360 --> 42:51.640
Someone please help!

43:15.840 --> 43:17.400
Merci.

43:21.920 --> 43:23.760
Don't you think it
might be them,

43:23.840 --> 43:25.440
Anton and Lana?

43:47.800 --> 43:48.960
Hello?

43:50.360 --> 43:51.400
Yes?

43:51.480 --> 43:53.720
Which hospital?

43:56.240 --> 43:58.640
Thank you. I have to go.

43:58.720 --> 44:01.440
My daughter.

44:25.760 --> 44:27.000
Hello, darling.

44:27.080 --> 44:29.040
Daddy!
Hello, hello, hello.

44:29.120 --> 44:30.720
Where's Maya?

44:30.800 --> 44:32.720
She's in with Kayla.

44:37.240 --> 44:41.440
Um... Kayla's had
a seizure.

44:41.520 --> 44:43.120
Yeah,
she nearly died.

44:43.200 --> 44:45.040
What?! What happened?

44:45.120 --> 44:46.640
It could've been
Maya in there.

44:46.720 --> 44:48.400
Why did you leave
her overnight?

44:48.480 --> 44:50.440
I didn't. She was with you.

44:50.520 --> 44:52.200
She was gonna call you.

44:52.280 --> 44:53.640
No, she didn't.
She didn't call me.

44:53.720 --> 44:54.880
She told me she had.

44:54.960 --> 44:56.560
So she lied to us,
basically.

44:56.640 --> 44:59.120
Wow. Kids lie.
That's what they do.

44:59.200 --> 45:01.200
Laura: Maya doesn't.

45:01.280 --> 45:03.280
I mean, what the fuck
is going on

45:03.360 --> 45:05.280
in that head of hers?

45:07.160 --> 45:08.680
You look knackered.

45:08.760 --> 45:10.360
Elise has gone missing.

45:10.440 --> 45:12.000
Shit.

45:15.760 --> 45:18.280
Well, at least she
took care of her friend.

45:18.360 --> 45:20.360
Do you think we should
get her

45:20.440 --> 45:22.160
some professional help?

45:22.240 --> 45:23.560
Hello, darling.

45:23.640 --> 45:24.880
Here you are.
Thanks.

45:24.960 --> 45:27.280
Dad.
Hello, love.

45:27.360 --> 45:29.080
I need to tell
you something.

45:29.160 --> 45:30.720
All right.

45:33.600 --> 45:36.120
She left her phone on
my bed.

45:44.960 --> 45:47.040
Are you saying you
stole those photos?

45:48.800 --> 45:50.560
Boys look at Kayla.

45:50.640 --> 45:53.880
But me, I'm invisible.

45:53.960 --> 45:55.800
Oh, for crying out loud. Maya.

45:55.880 --> 45:57.160
I just wanted someone
to need me.

45:57.240 --> 45:58.320
Oh, Jesus.
We need you.

45:58.400 --> 45:59.680
Sometimes...

45:59.760 --> 46:01.720
It doesn't feel like you do.

46:01.800 --> 46:03.600
So you get
your hair dyed

46:03.680 --> 46:05.296
or you get a piercing or you
lash out at us or something.

46:05.320 --> 46:06.376
You don't steal your
best friend's photos

46:06.400 --> 46:07.720
and put them out for
every...

46:07.800 --> 46:10.200
People saw those photos
who should never see...

46:10.280 --> 46:11.840
Kayla's father saw
those pictures.

46:11.920 --> 46:13.360
I'm sorry.

46:14.840 --> 46:17.640
We can't just wave
a magic wand

46:17.720 --> 46:19.440
to make this all right
for you.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.440
I just... I just want
you not to hate me.

46:26.520 --> 46:28.080
Mom, Billy wants

46:28.160 --> 46:29.640
some crisps.
Yeah, ok.

46:29.720 --> 46:30.800
Um, why
don't you

46:30.880 --> 46:32.120
read them a story

46:32.200 --> 46:33.680
and I'll be in
in a minute, all right?

46:33.704 --> 46:35.200
Karl: Where'd
that come from?

46:35.280 --> 46:37.080
Where did this
come from?

46:37.160 --> 46:38.536
From the school. It's
all right. It's all right.

46:38.560 --> 46:39.760
It's all right, darling.

46:39.840 --> 46:41.560
Just take that and
start reading to them.

46:41.640 --> 46:43.680
And why don't you
go back to work

46:43.760 --> 46:45.120
and look for Elise?

46:45.200 --> 46:46.400
I'll deal with this,

46:46.480 --> 46:48.760
and then we can talk
tomorrow, all right?

46:48.840 --> 46:49.760
Ok?

46:52.280 --> 46:53.840
Come on.

47:00.240 --> 47:01.680
Yeah?

47:01.760 --> 47:02.840
Something weird's
going on.

47:02.920 --> 47:04.800
Bb?

47:04.880 --> 47:07.840
I got 11 missing person
reports in the last 24 hours

47:07.920 --> 47:09.600
all from folkestone.

47:09.680 --> 47:11.240
People just vanishing.

47:11.320 --> 47:12.880
Any link between them?

47:12.960 --> 47:15.880
Well, they... they're
totally random.

47:15.960 --> 47:18.640
Some male, female,
young, old...

47:18.720 --> 47:20.960
All vanished off the street.

47:21.040 --> 47:25.040
The last one is
a delivery driver.

47:25.120 --> 47:28.120
He didn't turn up for his
last deliveries,

47:28.200 --> 47:30.440
and the tracker on his
truck's been disabled,

47:30.520 --> 47:32.480
but here's the thing that's
got me really worried.

47:33.600 --> 47:35.440
He was driving a meat truck.

48:02.120 --> 48:04.760
Laura: "Once more he
stepped into the street;

48:04.840 --> 48:07.240
"and to his lips again laid

48:07.320 --> 48:10.120
"his long pipe of smooth,
straight cane.

48:10.200 --> 48:14.520
"When, lo, as they
reached the mountain-side,

48:14.600 --> 48:18.280
a wondrous portal
opened wide..."

48:20.160 --> 48:24.280
"As if a cavern
were suddenly hollowed;

48:24.360 --> 48:31.080
"and the Piper advanced
and the children followed,

48:31.160 --> 48:35.880
"and when all were in
to the very last,

48:35.960 --> 48:40.280
the door in
the mountain-side shut fast."
