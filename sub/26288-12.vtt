WEBVTT

00:07.920 --> 00:09.313
How's it look?

00:09.357 --> 00:11.315
BISHOP:
Good. Maybe another angle?

00:11.359 --> 00:13.100
Hey, are we
missing something?

00:13.143 --> 00:14.710
Shell casings?

00:14.753 --> 00:16.320
Uh, hit men police their brass.

00:17.930 --> 00:19.280
Come back later.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.239
We have enough towels!

00:22.283 --> 00:23.501
GIBBS:
Open the door, Torres!

00:28.724 --> 00:30.073
Sorry, man.

00:30.117 --> 00:31.335
All right,
talk to me.

00:31.379 --> 00:34.077
Well, I'm trying to get
a few options here.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.688
I don't need options;
I just need one.

00:37.776 --> 00:39.343
Hey, Lieutenant.

00:40.518 --> 00:43.260
You can get up now.

00:46.176 --> 00:48.700
Well, that was a first.

01:19.427 --> 01:21.037
VANCE:
So this is all staged?

01:21.081 --> 01:22.865
Lieutenant Johnson,
he's still alive?

01:22.908 --> 01:24.171
He's in our break room
as we speak,

01:24.214 --> 01:25.563
eating a hoagie.

01:25.607 --> 01:27.826
Oh, well, all right.
I've done this dance before.

01:27.870 --> 01:29.219
Who are we trying to set up?

01:29.263 --> 01:32.048
Michael Deegan.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.703
Drug dealer.

01:34.746 --> 01:35.704
Specializes
in bootleg pharmaceuticals.

01:35.747 --> 01:37.184
I've heard the name.

01:37.227 --> 01:39.795
Feds have been after him
for years, nothing has stuck.

01:39.838 --> 01:41.405
Well, we may finally
have something

01:41.449 --> 01:42.450
on him.

01:42.493 --> 01:44.234
He ordered a hit
on our lieutenant.

01:44.278 --> 01:46.236
Why?

01:46.280 --> 01:48.064
We don't know.But the guy he hired

01:48.108 --> 01:50.153
to do the hit bungled the job.

01:50.197 --> 01:52.112
Yeah, ex-con.

01:52.155 --> 01:53.287
Tommy Mulligan.

01:54.940 --> 01:56.942
He goes by Peaches.

01:56.986 --> 01:58.074
Base security
caught him

01:58.118 --> 01:59.641
casing
the lieutenant's quarters

01:59.684 --> 02:01.382
with an unregistered gun
and silencer.

02:01.425 --> 02:04.341
Can you prove
that Deegan ordered the hit?

02:05.299 --> 02:07.257
Ah, I got it now.

02:07.301 --> 02:10.434
You want to offer
this Peaches a deal.

02:10.478 --> 02:12.480
He wears a wire,
we get Deegan

02:12.523 --> 02:14.569
to admit ordering the hit,
game over.

02:15.831 --> 02:18.312
And we already have
the paperwork.

02:20.009 --> 02:21.271
We're offering
Peaches immunity.

02:21.315 --> 02:23.055
Deegan's a big fish.

02:23.099 --> 02:24.796
Well, you've already taken
the picture.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.450
You don't leave me
much choice, do you?

02:29.540 --> 02:31.455
Okay.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.544
This guy screws up,
you're gonna have

02:33.588 --> 02:35.198
a real dead body on your hands.

02:35.242 --> 02:36.504
ASSISTANT :
Sorry to interrupt, Director.

02:36.547 --> 02:39.376
A Corporal John Sydney
is here for Agent Gibbs.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.770
Old friend?

02:41.813 --> 02:43.989
No...

02:44.033 --> 02:46.253
Just really old.

02:51.432 --> 02:54.348
So Leroy's walking home
from school one day

02:54.391 --> 02:57.002
and he...
he found this stray dog.

02:57.046 --> 02:59.570
Now, his father
strictly forbid dogs.

02:59.614 --> 03:02.965
But Leroy decided
to take the dog home

03:03.008 --> 03:05.402
and hide him in the bedroom.

03:05.446 --> 03:07.317
Breaking rules already.

03:07.361 --> 03:08.666
Nine years old.

03:08.710 --> 03:10.494
Oh, come on, Gibbs was never
nine years old.

03:10.538 --> 03:12.670
So what happened?

03:12.714 --> 03:14.455
Well, he got away with it
for a while,

03:14.498 --> 03:17.414
but one night a... a crow flew
in the bedroom window.

03:17.458 --> 03:20.678
The dog barked so loud,
it woke up the whole house.

03:20.722 --> 03:22.985
What'd his dad do then?

03:23.028 --> 03:24.943
GIBBS:
Got the belt.

03:24.987 --> 03:27.076
I still got to keep
the dog, though.

03:27.119 --> 03:29.383
Apollo.
Apollo.

03:30.558 --> 03:31.733
Good dog.

03:31.776 --> 03:34.257
Well, don't just
stand there, Leroy.

03:35.476 --> 03:37.521
Wow, look at you.

03:41.046 --> 03:43.353
Mr. Sydney.

03:43.397 --> 03:44.963
Been a long time.

03:46.617 --> 03:49.446
Well, they say
time heals all wounds.

03:50.621 --> 03:52.319
Yeah, that's what they say.

03:54.277 --> 03:56.540
Listen, Leroy, I-I...

03:56.584 --> 03:58.194
I got some sad news.

03:59.848 --> 04:02.285
LJ passed last night.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.331
Yeah, his son called me.

04:04.374 --> 04:06.463
He said the service
is next month.

04:06.507 --> 04:07.856
LJ?

04:07.899 --> 04:09.249
Leroy Jethro Moore.

04:09.292 --> 04:10.902
It's the guy
Gibbs was named after.

04:10.946 --> 04:13.514
He was a good man.Great man.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.386
I'll see you at the funeral.

04:16.430 --> 04:17.909
Yeah, listen.

04:17.953 --> 04:20.260
I actually came up here
for something else.

04:20.303 --> 04:21.652
Can we talk a minute?

04:21.696 --> 04:23.567
Listen, uh...It'll just take
a second.

04:23.611 --> 04:26.266
Call me later,
all right?

04:27.745 --> 04:29.486
I-I'm working here.

04:29.530 --> 04:31.619
Okay?
Palmer.
Yeah?

04:31.662 --> 04:34.274
See Mr. Sydney out,
please.

04:42.107 --> 04:44.327
Nice seeing you, Leroy.

04:44.371 --> 04:45.589
All right, Gibbs.
We're all set here.

04:45.633 --> 04:46.895
This is Tommy Mulligan.

04:46.938 --> 04:48.244
You can call me Peaches.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.333
We're gonna get
him all wired up.

04:50.377 --> 04:51.856
He's gonna meet Deegan
in an hour.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.118
We'll be right there
with him.

04:53.162 --> 04:54.903
Gear up.

04:54.946 --> 04:56.948
I hope you guys know
what you're doing.

04:58.341 --> 05:00.082
McGEE:
Okay, Peaches, it's showtime.

05:00.125 --> 05:01.475
Now, remember,
you have two jobs.

05:01.518 --> 05:05.348
One: get Deegan to admit
he ordered the murder.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.132
Two: collect the payoff.

05:07.176 --> 05:09.526
I don't know if I can do this.

05:09.570 --> 05:12.181
McGEE: Well, it's a little
late for that.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.793
What if I mess it up?

05:15.837 --> 05:17.534
You know, I get caught,
I get dead.

05:17.578 --> 05:19.144
You're gonna do great. Look,

05:19.188 --> 05:20.755
two things:

05:20.798 --> 05:22.191
murder and money, nice and easy.

05:23.235 --> 05:25.150
I don't know.

05:25.194 --> 05:27.065
Option two: go to jail.

05:28.110 --> 05:29.720
Okay.

05:29.764 --> 05:31.156
I got this,
I got this.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.724
Murder, money. Nice and easy.

05:33.768 --> 05:35.030
Yep.

05:41.689 --> 05:43.386
A little room here.

05:43.430 --> 05:44.953
Well, it's got to look legit.

05:44.996 --> 05:47.085
This really how you sit
with your dinner dates?

05:47.129 --> 05:49.087
It's how they sit with me.

05:49.131 --> 05:50.393
Wow.

05:50.437 --> 05:52.917
All right, here we go.

05:56.225 --> 05:57.618
PEACHES:
Mr. Deegan.

05:57.661 --> 05:59.707

Money? For what?

06:48.625 --> 06:50.453
PEACHES:
For the guy.

06:53.238 --> 06:54.675
For the guy that-- that you...

06:54.718 --> 06:57.329
you wanted me to... to kill.

06:57.373 --> 07:00.942
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

07:14.216 --> 07:16.000
Hey, Peaches.

07:16.044 --> 07:18.046
What the hell happened?: I don't know.

07:18.089 --> 07:20.178
Bull. You tipped off Deegan.

07:20.222 --> 07:21.484
No, I-I didn't.

07:21.528 --> 07:22.833
You heard the whole thing.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.008
You're lying.

07:24.052 --> 07:25.793
I promise.

07:25.836 --> 07:27.447
On my mother's good name.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.231
Your mother's in prison.

07:30.275 --> 07:31.407
What do you think?

07:31.451 --> 07:33.409
How did Deegan know
this was a setup?

07:33.453 --> 07:35.411
Well, if Peaches tipped him off,
we missed it.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.108
I don't know,
maybe some kind of code?

07:37.152 --> 07:41.896
I-If Deegan knows
that I wore a-a wire,

07:41.939 --> 07:42.984
I'm a dead man.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.464
You have to arrest him.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.857
That's not how the law works.Why?

07:46.901 --> 07:48.119
He ordered the hit.

07:48.163 --> 07:51.035
Says you. We needed him
to admit it on tape.

07:51.079 --> 07:53.037
I tried.

07:53.081 --> 07:54.561
So what ha-- what happens now?

07:58.216 --> 07:59.783
But...

08:04.092 --> 08:05.572
Can we delay Peaches' release?

08:06.616 --> 08:08.139
Maybe by 24 hours. Why?

08:08.183 --> 08:11.839
Because Deegan still thinks
the lieutenant is dead.

08:11.882 --> 08:14.145
SLOANE:
And if we let Peaches go,
he could tell him.

08:14.189 --> 08:16.104
Okay, so what's
the new plan?

08:17.453 --> 08:19.107
So you're taking me to jail
while the guy

08:19.150 --> 08:20.978
that wants me dead is walking
the streets?

08:21.022 --> 08:23.198
Protective custody
is not jail, okay?

08:23.241 --> 08:24.721
It's a hotel room.

08:24.765 --> 08:27.028
And secondly, if someone wanted
me dead, I would sure want

08:27.071 --> 08:28.943
to keep my head down
until I found out why.

08:28.986 --> 08:31.554
I told you, I have no idea.

08:31.598 --> 08:33.208
Look, think of the alternative.

08:33.251 --> 08:35.776
The bounty is probably still
on your head.

08:35.819 --> 08:38.300
You could go home and we could
just hope for the best.

08:42.260 --> 08:44.219
Okay.

08:51.705 --> 08:54.229
NCIS.
We need to talk
to Deegan.

08:54.272 --> 08:55.578
He's busy.

08:55.622 --> 08:56.971
Maybe talk later.

08:57.014 --> 08:58.494
Maybe talk now.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.236
It's okay, Burly.

09:06.110 --> 09:08.199
NCIS.

09:08.243 --> 09:09.723
You're new.

09:09.766 --> 09:12.116
Usually it's the
FBI or the DEA.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.640
It's tough to keep
you all straight.

09:13.683 --> 09:15.729
Well, we're the ones
who are here to arrest you.

09:15.772 --> 09:17.034
For murder,
by the way.

09:17.078 --> 09:19.210
Oh. Well, I admire
your confidence.

09:19.254 --> 09:20.995
As misplaced as it may be.

09:24.781 --> 09:26.130
What's this?

09:26.174 --> 09:27.741
It's two iced teas.

09:27.784 --> 09:30.482
That is what you ordered
earlier, correct?

09:30.526 --> 09:32.615
When you were watching
from the booth?

09:32.659 --> 09:33.964
You see,

09:34.008 --> 09:37.141
a good businessman knows
his customers.

09:37.185 --> 09:38.882
Not customers.

09:38.926 --> 09:41.145
We just wanted to let
you know that your boy

09:41.189 --> 09:44.671
Peaches is in custody
for killing a Navy lieutenant.

09:44.714 --> 09:47.151
He said that you ordered
the hit.

09:47.195 --> 09:48.762
Did he now?

09:48.805 --> 09:50.198
Huh.

09:50.241 --> 09:51.329
Well, why would I do that?

09:51.373 --> 09:54.898
We've got the
DEA file on you.

09:54.942 --> 09:56.770
You're being investigated
for drug dealing.

09:56.813 --> 09:59.294
And now
one of your own soldiers

09:59.337 --> 10:01.775
is accusing you of murder.

10:01.818 --> 10:04.299
The walls are closing in,
Deegan.

10:04.342 --> 10:07.476
Well, I appreciate
you stopping by.

10:12.655 --> 10:13.787
Oh, NCIS.

10:15.223 --> 10:17.225
Don't forget your bug.

10:29.759 --> 10:30.717
Hey.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.327
Make yourself at home.

10:32.370 --> 10:35.852
I was gonna chew you out for
not locking that door, but...

10:35.896 --> 10:38.986
I see you have
nothing here worth stealing.

10:39.029 --> 10:42.032
I thought we were gonna talk
in the morning.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.470
What do you want, Mr. Sydney?

10:45.514 --> 10:47.995
Call me John, okay?

10:48.038 --> 10:50.388
You're not a kid
anymore. Come here.

10:50.432 --> 10:52.216
Come here.

10:52.260 --> 10:56.568
Listen, remember those yahoos

10:56.612 --> 10:58.875
your dad and me
used to pal around with

10:58.919 --> 11:01.704
after we came home
from, from Normandy?

11:01.748 --> 11:04.751
No.

11:04.794 --> 11:09.843
12 veterans from World War II,
all, all from Stillwater High.

11:09.886 --> 11:11.845
We called ourselves the...

11:11.888 --> 11:13.934
Last Man Club.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.326
Yeah.
Yeah.

11:15.370 --> 11:18.112
Now that LJ's gone,

11:18.155 --> 11:19.679
you're the last man.

11:19.722 --> 11:23.204
Not exactly a title
I wanted to hold, but...

11:23.247 --> 11:25.467
here I am.

11:25.510 --> 11:29.340
Which means I've got to fulfill
the Last Man Club oath.

11:29.384 --> 11:34.345
To collect all of these
from every man.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.914
These military ID bracelets?

11:37.958 --> 11:41.613
Yeah. I'm glad to see you
wearing your dad's.

11:41.657 --> 11:43.441
You know what it says
on the back?

11:45.226 --> 11:46.531
"Forever Linked."

11:46.575 --> 11:49.099
We all got the
same inscription

11:49.143 --> 11:51.101
and vowed that the last man
alive would

11:51.145 --> 11:53.408
track down all the bracelets,

11:53.451 --> 11:58.108
and when he died, they'd go
in the ground with him.

11:58.152 --> 12:00.720
I know it sounds corny, but...

12:00.763 --> 12:03.244
No, not yet.

12:03.287 --> 12:05.420
After we find LJ's.

12:05.463 --> 12:07.596
We?

12:07.639 --> 12:09.990
Yeah, his son can't
find it, he says that LJ

12:10.033 --> 12:11.992
might have put it in a lockbox

12:12.035 --> 12:15.082
in that general store
he owned with your dad.

12:15.125 --> 12:16.736
Look, that was a long time ago.

12:16.779 --> 12:18.085
I gave the store away
after Dad died.

12:18.128 --> 12:19.477
I know.

12:19.521 --> 12:24.265
Yeah, that's...
that's why I need you.

12:25.701 --> 12:27.921
I'll pick you up
in the morning.

12:27.964 --> 12:29.226
N-No.

12:29.270 --> 12:31.315
I can't do that in the morning.

12:31.359 --> 12:33.665
I'm in the middle
of an investigation.

12:33.709 --> 12:36.146
So am I, Leroy Jethro.

12:36.190 --> 12:38.496
I need you.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.421
Good morning, sunshine.

12:50.465 --> 12:51.335
You're late.

12:51.379 --> 12:53.076
It's 8:03.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.818
Like I said, late.

12:55.862 --> 12:56.950
How's the lieutenant?

12:56.993 --> 12:58.386
Never left the bedroom.

12:58.429 --> 12:59.648
Slept like a baby.

12:59.691 --> 13:01.345
Now eating breakfast.

13:01.389 --> 13:03.739
Two things I want to be doing
instead of talking to you.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.132
Hey, probie.

13:05.175 --> 13:06.350
Graveyard shift
is no reason

13:06.394 --> 13:08.396
to be disrespecting
your fellow agents.

13:08.439 --> 13:10.398
VENTURA:
Right.

13:10.441 --> 13:12.313
Sorry.

13:12.356 --> 13:13.444
Sir.

13:13.488 --> 13:15.055
My nightly report
is on the table.

13:15.098 --> 13:17.231
Anything else?

13:17.274 --> 13:18.841
Go get some sleep.

13:23.541 --> 13:25.500
Damn.

13:25.543 --> 13:26.806
Yo, man.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.372
Way to get
in that probie's grill.

13:28.416 --> 13:29.939
I was a probie a long time.

13:29.983 --> 13:33.247
Can't act like that.

13:33.290 --> 13:37.468
Well, no phone
calls, no visitors.

13:37.512 --> 13:40.384
Lieutenant, how are we doing?

13:40.428 --> 13:43.039
Actually, I could get used to
this protective custody thing.

13:43.083 --> 13:44.867
Well, good,

13:44.911 --> 13:46.826
'cause unfortunately,
we can't let you leave just yet.

13:46.869 --> 13:50.873
We still have a few, uh, screws
to turn on this Deegan thing.

13:53.397 --> 13:56.270
Agent Ventura forget something?

13:56.313 --> 13:57.488
She has her own key.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.317
Get in the bathroom.

14:00.361 --> 14:02.580
Seriously?Go.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.540
Who is it?

14:05.583 --> 14:08.586
MAN:
Room service. Breakfast.

14:09.718 --> 14:10.937
He already had breakfast.

14:10.980 --> 14:13.722
One second.

14:22.426 --> 14:24.298
NCIS!

14:24.341 --> 14:25.342
What the hell do
you think you're doing?

14:25.386 --> 14:27.431
I-I have breakfast. An omelet.

14:27.475 --> 14:29.564
We already have breakfast.
Who sent you?

14:29.607 --> 14:30.913
Just read the door menu.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.610
The cart has
a menu on it.

14:34.743 --> 14:37.572
Well?It's an omelet.

14:37.615 --> 14:38.834
I told you.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.531
If this guy's legit...

14:40.575 --> 14:41.576
JOHNSON:
Agent McGee!

14:43.447 --> 14:44.405
TORRES:
Lieutenant.

14:46.276 --> 14:47.364
Stay with me.

14:47.408 --> 14:49.540
Call 911.

14:49.584 --> 14:50.977
Try to breathe,
try to breathe.

14:51.020 --> 14:51.978
Slow it down,

14:52.021 --> 14:53.893
slow it down.

15:04.991 --> 15:07.297
TORRES:
This is weird, man.

15:07.341 --> 15:09.430
I mean, we just took
these exact same photos.

15:09.473 --> 15:11.693
Yeah, but he's not
getting up this time.

15:11.736 --> 15:13.869
Okay, so I'm thinking
that this was...

15:13.913 --> 15:15.001
Poison?

15:15.044 --> 15:16.480
Yeah, that or a drug overdose.

15:16.524 --> 15:20.528
See the foamy discharge,
clammy skin.

15:20.571 --> 15:22.922
These pinpoint pupils.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.749
Hey. Drew a sketch
of the suspect.

15:24.793 --> 15:27.970
Agent Ventura got a
pretty good look at him.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.493
Posed as a room service guy.

15:29.537 --> 15:31.321
This one of Deegan's guys?

15:31.365 --> 15:33.671
Has to be.Surveillance cameras?

15:33.715 --> 15:36.457
Only got the back of his head,
so the sketch is all we've got.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.024
Lieutenant Johnson
brought his cell phone,

15:38.067 --> 15:40.504
which we told him
not to do.

15:40.548 --> 15:42.289
It's probably how Deegan
tracked him down.

15:42.332 --> 15:43.943
This is our fault.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.466
Yeah.

15:45.509 --> 15:46.902
BISHOP: If Nick and I
didn't get made,

15:46.946 --> 15:49.383
the sting would've worked.

15:49.426 --> 15:50.688
And Deegan would be in jail,

15:50.732 --> 15:52.734
Lieutenant Johnson would
probably still be alive,

15:52.777 --> 15:55.650
but, I mean, that is
if it was Deegan.

15:55.693 --> 15:57.434
Deegan's a drug dealer.

15:57.478 --> 16:00.220
Lieutenant Johnson died
of a drug overdose.

16:00.263 --> 16:01.656
You do the math.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.964
Oh, yeah? Prove it.

16:08.619 --> 16:10.447
I am so sorry, Lieutenant.

16:10.491 --> 16:14.060
Our team tried everything
to protect you, and we failed.

16:15.496 --> 16:17.280
And that is a tragedy.

16:17.324 --> 16:19.848
Palmer, what do we got?

16:19.891 --> 16:22.198
I just sent the stomach contents
up to Kasie.

16:22.242 --> 16:23.286
Should hear something soon.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.288
All right, call me when we do.

16:25.332 --> 16:27.987
Oh, a-and, Gibbs.

16:28.030 --> 16:30.815
I'm so sorry to hear about
your dad's friend passing away.

16:32.078 --> 16:34.384
Yeah, thanks, Palmer.

16:34.428 --> 16:35.690
Yeah, Mr. Sydney said
that he and your dad

16:35.733 --> 16:37.997
were super
close as well.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.477
He said that he used
to live with you

16:40.521 --> 16:42.175
when you were growing up.

16:42.218 --> 16:44.568
Uh-huh.

16:44.612 --> 16:46.614
What else did he say?

16:46.657 --> 16:48.659
You know? Nothing.

16:48.703 --> 16:50.748
He... that's all he said.

16:52.663 --> 16:54.143
Palmer.

16:54.187 --> 16:57.277
Okay, well, it's just that, uh,

16:57.320 --> 16:58.756
Mr. Sydney said he couldn't
get his act together

16:58.800 --> 17:00.280
after he left the Army.

17:00.323 --> 17:03.326
And your dad took him
in, got him a job.

17:03.370 --> 17:05.720
Said that he used
to take you fishing,

17:05.763 --> 17:08.114
just the two of you,
down at Old Morris Pond.

17:08.157 --> 17:09.376
What are you doing,

17:09.419 --> 17:10.725
writing a book on this guy?

17:10.768 --> 17:12.901
No, unless you think I should.

17:12.944 --> 17:14.120
Listen,

17:14.163 --> 17:17.645
what did he mean

17:17.688 --> 17:20.300
when he told you
"time heals all wounds"?

17:20.343 --> 17:22.954
Evacuate autopsy!

17:22.998 --> 17:24.130
What?

17:24.173 --> 17:26.045
Get out, get out,
get out, get out!

17:26.088 --> 17:28.743
Carfentanil.
At least six milligrams.

17:28.786 --> 17:29.700
Oh, wow.Emergency showers.

17:29.744 --> 17:31.746
Go.No, the last time I used

17:31.789 --> 17:33.139
that shower, I got this
nasty toe fungus that...

17:33.182 --> 17:34.531
Wait, what is carfentanil?

17:34.575 --> 17:36.316
Torres touched the food,
and he's showering now.

17:36.359 --> 17:38.709
And you could have been exposed
to airborne particles down here.

17:38.753 --> 17:40.972
What is carfentanil?Sorry.

17:41.016 --> 17:43.627
Carfentanil is the-- a very
concentrated form of fentanyl.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.847
Used as an elephant
tranquilizer.

17:45.890 --> 17:47.892
But I was extremely careful
when I washed the body, so...

17:47.936 --> 17:50.852
Palmer, go. Shower, go now.

17:50.895 --> 17:53.637
Nasty toe fungus, here I come.

17:55.639 --> 17:59.600
Now, Leroy's fastball
wasn't exactly fast,

17:59.643 --> 18:03.821
so I, I said, "You better learn
how to throw a breaking ball."

18:03.865 --> 18:06.520
You were his coach?Not really,

18:06.563 --> 18:08.696
but we spent a whole winter
working on a curveball,

18:08.739 --> 18:09.914
and he-he got it.

18:09.958 --> 18:11.612
So what happened
when spring rolled around?

18:11.655 --> 18:13.004
He doesn't know.

18:14.005 --> 18:17.922
No, I-I-I wasn't
around, but...

18:17.966 --> 18:20.490
I'll bet you won
a few games.

18:23.319 --> 18:24.625
Are you ready to go?

18:24.668 --> 18:25.626
Go?

18:25.669 --> 18:27.280
Uh...

18:27.323 --> 18:29.456
John, like I said,
Gibbs won't leave

18:29.499 --> 18:30.457
in the middle of a case.

18:30.500 --> 18:31.762
Well, do it for LJ.

18:31.806 --> 18:33.677
Do it for your dad.
They made a promise.

18:35.636 --> 18:37.942
A man's only as good
as his word.

18:39.422 --> 18:42.121
Come on. Get your ass in my car.

18:42.164 --> 18:44.384
Good to see you.You, too.

18:48.388 --> 18:50.868
Hi.

18:50.912 --> 18:53.393
Hey, we can handle
things here.

18:53.436 --> 18:55.656
Torres and McGee
are out retracing

18:55.699 --> 18:58.006
the lieutenant's footsteps.

18:58.049 --> 19:00.487
You'll be back
before they're done.

19:10.888 --> 19:14.892
Bishop, McGee's got lead.

19:18.287 --> 19:19.854
Where are they going?

19:19.897 --> 19:21.247
Their hometown.

19:21.290 --> 19:23.249
Those two have
a history.

19:23.292 --> 19:25.294
Hopefully they'll work it out.

19:25.338 --> 19:27.731
It's a long drive to Stillwater.

19:29.820 --> 19:31.779
MEGAN:
Yeah, I-I seen him.

19:31.822 --> 19:33.433
Maybe.

19:33.476 --> 19:35.783
Well, which one is it,
yeah or maybe?

19:35.826 --> 19:37.828
What make of car he got?

19:37.872 --> 19:39.047
Black Subaru.

19:39.090 --> 19:41.049
Rip in the driver's seat.
Sat right there.

19:41.092 --> 19:43.704
I stayed late to finish.
That was Monday.

19:43.747 --> 19:46.010
Well, according
to the cell phone GPS,

19:46.054 --> 19:49.927
Lieutenant Johnson was here
Monday and Tuesday.

19:49.971 --> 19:51.886
Didn't see him Tuesday.

19:51.929 --> 19:53.714
Why come to the shop
if he's not gonna...

19:53.757 --> 19:55.150
speak to the owner?

19:55.194 --> 19:56.891
That surveillance camera work?

19:56.934 --> 19:59.850
You bet.
Holds a full week on DVR.

19:59.894 --> 20:01.461
Ah.

20:01.504 --> 20:03.376
Let me get it.

20:05.943 --> 20:09.860
Ooh, bacon brown sugar chips.

20:09.904 --> 20:11.732
You eat those things?

20:11.775 --> 20:13.560
No, man, those are gross.

20:13.603 --> 20:16.563
Bishop loves them, and I kind of
owe her for texting her date

20:16.606 --> 20:17.912
that she couldn't go out.

20:17.955 --> 20:18.739
Oh.

20:18.782 --> 20:19.827
Hey, you got a buck?

20:19.870 --> 20:21.350
What, you don't have
a dollar on you?

20:21.394 --> 20:23.134
Cash is for suckers.

20:24.745 --> 20:26.877
I got a five.Thank you.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.755
Yeah.

20:38.193 --> 20:39.542
Where's my change?

20:39.586 --> 20:41.588
Not my problem.

20:41.631 --> 20:43.372
There's an 800 number
if you got a complaint.

20:43.416 --> 20:45.940
McGEE:
No, don't worry about it.

20:45.983 --> 20:47.115
Thank you for this.
We'll return it

20:47.158 --> 20:48.638
as soon as
we're finished.

20:48.682 --> 20:50.640
Okay.

20:54.383 --> 20:56.298
Really?

20:56.342 --> 20:58.169
I had four dollars credit.

20:58.213 --> 20:59.954
Oh.

20:59.997 --> 21:01.782
SYDNEY:
Yes, sir. Route 83,

21:01.825 --> 21:04.263
about another hundred miles.

21:04.306 --> 21:06.265
I know my way to Stillwater.

21:06.308 --> 21:09.485
This is why I wanted
to take the truck.

21:09.529 --> 21:10.965
You kidding me?

21:11.008 --> 21:14.273
That old jalopy would have
broken down halfway there.

21:14.316 --> 21:16.362
We arebroken down
halfway there.

21:16.405 --> 21:19.103
No, no. She's just resting.

21:19.147 --> 21:22.803
Little water, a little time,
she'll be purring like a cat.

21:22.846 --> 21:24.239
Ow.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.023
You need oil, too.

21:26.067 --> 21:27.677
Oil's in the trunk.

21:33.944 --> 21:35.816
I'm not crazy, you know.

21:35.859 --> 21:39.080
I never said you were crazy.

21:39.123 --> 21:40.995
You don't return
phone calls.

21:41.038 --> 21:43.867
You're a good son, Leroy.

21:43.911 --> 21:46.696
Jackson would've
been proud of you.

21:46.740 --> 21:50.874
I never had kids.
My greatest regret.

21:50.918 --> 21:55.401
You were the closest thing
I ever had to a son.

21:57.011 --> 21:59.361
Didn't I teach you
how to change the oil

21:59.405 --> 22:01.363
in a, in a car just like this?

22:01.407 --> 22:03.844
No. Dad did.

22:03.887 --> 22:06.325
You taught me how to play craps.

22:14.071 --> 22:16.422
Okay, what am
I looking at?

22:16.465 --> 22:17.945
Megan Boone's
upholstery shop.

22:17.988 --> 22:19.990
And that's someone
that I am calling

22:20.034 --> 22:21.775
"Blonde Guy."Hm.

22:21.818 --> 22:24.168
I think he's the reason the
lieutenant went back on Tuesday.

22:24.212 --> 22:26.170
So they talk
for a few minutes,

22:26.214 --> 22:28.999
and then the lieutenant
hands Blonde Man an envelope.

22:29.043 --> 22:32.046
Wish we could see
what was inside.

22:32.089 --> 22:34.048
Oh, but we can.

22:34.091 --> 22:36.746
Freeze and enhance.

22:36.790 --> 22:37.965
Is that a hundred-dollar bill?

22:38.008 --> 22:39.749
Yup.
There's more underneath.

22:39.793 --> 22:41.925
Can you fun facial recognition
on Blondie?

22:41.969 --> 22:43.797
Tried.
Came up empty.

22:45.712 --> 22:47.453
Oh, my gosh.

22:47.496 --> 22:49.280
What?
You recognize him?

22:50.369 --> 22:52.371
Maybe.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.029
This is my sketch

22:59.073 --> 23:01.162
of the suspect who brought
the poison omelet.

23:01.205 --> 23:03.382
Uh, looks like
the same guy,

23:03.425 --> 23:05.166
which means...

23:05.209 --> 23:09.126
Lieutenant Johnson
knew the man who killed him.

23:18.484 --> 23:20.660
We got an ID on the suspect?

23:20.703 --> 23:22.792
Uh, no, not yet.

23:22.836 --> 23:25.186
Can we tie him to Deegan?We're working on it, sir.

23:25.229 --> 23:26.883
Work faster.

23:26.927 --> 23:29.233
I signed off on this deal
and it went sideways.

23:29.277 --> 23:32.454
I want to get this investigation
back on track.

23:32.498 --> 23:33.977
Yeah.McGEE: Hey.

23:34.021 --> 23:35.457
Kasie found something

23:35.501 --> 23:38.808
on the auto shop
surveillance tape.

23:38.852 --> 23:42.159
Watch what Blonde Man does
after Lieutenant Johnson leaves.

23:44.727 --> 23:47.338
TORRES: He must work
for the vending machine company.

23:47.382 --> 23:48.775
Yeah, well, whoever he is,

23:48.818 --> 23:50.124
we can probably
get his prints.

23:50.167 --> 23:52.909
Oh, shoot,
am I eating evidence?

23:52.953 --> 23:54.215
Who owns the machine?

23:54.258 --> 23:55.521
It's not the shop owner.

23:55.564 --> 23:57.218
She just leases out the space.

23:57.261 --> 23:59.394
I have left three messages
with the machine's

23:59.438 --> 24:01.875
1-800 number, and I'm still
waiting on a response.

24:01.918 --> 24:03.485
Get a warrant.Warrant.

24:03.529 --> 24:05.182
Warrant.

24:09.752 --> 24:12.581
SYDNEY: There used to be
a great old German bakery

24:12.625 --> 24:15.932
right there.
You get back here much?

24:18.021 --> 24:20.415
I haven't been to Stillwater
since Dad died.

24:22.243 --> 24:25.376
I called you about his funeral.

24:27.291 --> 24:30.251
We're here.

24:33.297 --> 24:34.516
SYDNEY:
Well, it's 3:15.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.649
We should've fixed
the car faster.

24:36.692 --> 24:39.260
We tried.
Let's head back.

24:40.783 --> 24:43.786
Hey, Sydney.
You dragged me

24:43.830 --> 24:46.789
all the way out here,
now, what-- you're gonna quit?

24:46.833 --> 24:48.530
I thought you'd be happy.
You don't have time

24:48.574 --> 24:49.966
to stay overnight.

24:51.577 --> 24:52.534
Come on, let's go.

24:52.578 --> 24:54.405
It was a long shot anyway.

24:54.449 --> 24:55.929
I don't understand you.

24:55.972 --> 24:58.192
Like you're an open book.

24:59.846 --> 25:04.372
Hey, Leroy,
the car's this way.

25:08.985 --> 25:11.466
Gibbs.
What a surprise.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.251
Hello, Cal. Hope we're
not interrupting.

25:14.295 --> 25:16.340
Oh, no, no. I wish I knew
you were coming,

25:16.384 --> 25:17.385
but sure, come in, come in.

25:17.428 --> 25:20.823
No, sorry. We can't.

25:20.867 --> 25:23.522
Well, what brings you back
to the old hometown?

25:23.565 --> 25:24.740
Hey, I'm Cal Frazier.

25:24.784 --> 25:26.829
John Sydney.
Believe it or not,

25:26.873 --> 25:29.223
I used to live in
the Gibbs house for a time.

25:29.266 --> 25:31.573
Wow.
Well, a lot's changed.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.270
Those damn big-box stores
have put

25:33.314 --> 25:34.837
a lot of mom-and-pop shops
out of business.

25:34.881 --> 25:37.579
Not you.Nope.

25:37.623 --> 25:38.798
General store's
still hanging on.

25:38.841 --> 25:40.582
So speaking of the store,

25:40.626 --> 25:43.585
we're looking for one of these.
We thought maybe

25:43.629 --> 25:46.501
it might've been left inside
somewhere along the line.

25:46.545 --> 25:49.635
Uh, sorry, no. I haven't seen
anything like that.

25:49.678 --> 25:51.680
But I did find something
when I was cleaning out

25:51.724 --> 25:53.726
the old storeroom last summer.
Just let me grab it.

25:53.769 --> 25:54.901
Thanks.

26:00.602 --> 26:02.604
What a time warp, huh?

26:02.648 --> 26:04.475
I can remember

26:04.519 --> 26:06.826
you racing your bike
up and down these streets.

26:06.869 --> 26:09.480
Yeah, I remember.

26:09.524 --> 26:11.526
Everything.

26:15.530 --> 26:18.402
Leroy, let-let's cut
the crap, okay?

26:18.446 --> 26:20.404
You got a problem, just say it.

26:20.448 --> 26:22.668
I got nothing to say.

26:22.711 --> 26:25.540
Oh, baloney.
What-what, I'm an old man,

26:25.584 --> 26:28.587
you don't think I can take it?

26:30.632 --> 26:32.591
You really want
to talk about this?

26:32.634 --> 26:35.506
Damn right. You've been wanting
to say something to me

26:35.550 --> 26:37.552
ever since I got back.

26:40.033 --> 26:42.601
Why did you leave?What?

26:42.644 --> 26:45.081
When I was a kid.

26:45.125 --> 26:47.562
Why did you leave our house?

26:49.129 --> 26:51.827
Oh, boy.

26:51.871 --> 26:55.222
Leroy...

26:55.265 --> 26:57.877
after the war,

26:57.920 --> 27:01.010
your dad and me
drank a lot.

27:01.054 --> 27:02.751
We used to go out
carousing

27:02.795 --> 27:05.667
almost every night
with the guys.

27:05.711 --> 27:08.104
But that's not exactly conducive

27:08.148 --> 27:10.411
to raising a family.

27:10.454 --> 27:14.067
I thought you were family.

27:14.110 --> 27:16.547
Your mother didn't.

27:16.591 --> 27:18.854
She came in one morning
and said,

27:18.898 --> 27:21.901
"Okay, war's over.
Playtime's over.

27:21.944 --> 27:24.512
John, get out."

27:24.555 --> 27:26.470
Yeah, but you just left.

27:26.514 --> 27:28.647
You n-you never said goodbye.

27:30.387 --> 27:33.260
I'm so sorry, son.

27:33.303 --> 27:35.436
I... I guess...

27:35.479 --> 27:37.786
I guess I just didn't know how.

27:37.830 --> 27:41.616
Tell you the truth,
I wasn't-I wasn't well.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.708
Sorry for the wait.

27:46.752 --> 27:49.145
Uh, hope it has
what you're looking for.

27:49.189 --> 27:50.843
Thank you.

28:10.384 --> 28:14.431
No. No. No.

28:14.475 --> 28:17.173
No. No.BISHOP: Kasie, you okay?

28:17.217 --> 28:18.740
No.

28:18.784 --> 28:21.656
I'm being outsmarted
by a vending machine.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.440
There's no keyhole anywhere.

28:23.484 --> 28:26.139
Not that I have the key,
but... still.

28:26.182 --> 28:28.228
Just break the glass.Oh, I tried.

28:28.271 --> 28:30.012
It's bulletproof.Hmm.

28:30.056 --> 28:31.840
Bulletproof glass
for candy bars?

28:31.884 --> 28:33.929
That's actually
only the beginning.

28:35.714 --> 28:36.932
Vibration alarm.

28:36.976 --> 28:38.760
On a vending machine?

28:38.804 --> 28:40.370
KASIE: And it's not even
plugged in. It must be

28:40.414 --> 28:42.633
on a backup battery.
And that's not to mention

28:42.677 --> 28:45.636
the HD camera that's recording
every transaction.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.682
You know, ATMs
aren't this secure.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.729
Uh, stupid question,
but did you call the 800 number?

28:50.772 --> 28:53.732
Only 13 times.
And left 13 messages.

28:53.775 --> 28:56.517
It's all good. Just give me
two minutes and a sledgehammer.

28:56.560 --> 28:59.346
Um, and have you destroy
evidence that might lead us

28:59.389 --> 29:02.262
to Blonde Guy?
No thanks.

29:02.305 --> 29:04.351
I'll find another way
into Fort Knox.

29:04.394 --> 29:06.092
What's so valuable
in here that's worth

29:06.135 --> 29:08.355
all this protection?

29:12.402 --> 29:15.884
I didn't blame your mother.

29:15.928 --> 29:19.148
She was just trying
to protect her family.

29:19.192 --> 29:21.281
She didn't have to
throw you out.

29:21.324 --> 29:23.196
You needed help.

29:23.239 --> 29:25.154
Oh, she tried to help me out.

29:25.198 --> 29:27.591
I didn't want any help.

29:27.635 --> 29:29.811
So I just left town.

29:29.855 --> 29:32.379
Well, it might've helped
to know the truth.

29:32.422 --> 29:36.209
Maybe, but how could I explain
that to a nine-year-old

29:36.252 --> 29:38.777
when I couldn't even
explain it to myself?

29:38.820 --> 29:41.562
My dad should've told me.

29:41.605 --> 29:45.522
: Well, he was
a stubborn old bastard.

29:45.566 --> 29:48.047
No argument there.

29:50.266 --> 29:53.008
I never thought we'd find
that bracelet.

29:53.052 --> 29:56.490
Where's your bracelet?
You lose it?

29:56.533 --> 29:58.187
Why do you say that?

29:58.231 --> 29:59.798
Well, because I think
if you had it,

29:59.841 --> 30:02.235
you'd be wearing it.

30:03.497 --> 30:05.281
No, I did not lose it.

30:05.325 --> 30:07.501
I threw it away.

30:07.544 --> 30:09.851
You what? Why?

30:09.895 --> 30:12.462
I was angry.

30:12.506 --> 30:15.335
And-and ashamed.

30:15.378 --> 30:18.381
On the day
I-I moved out, I... I just

30:18.425 --> 30:19.992
threw it in the trash,

30:20.035 --> 30:22.168
quit the club,

30:22.211 --> 30:24.823
left town.

30:24.866 --> 30:27.434
So why are you doing this?

30:27.477 --> 30:31.525
We all made a vow.

30:31.568 --> 30:34.310
And I was...

30:34.354 --> 30:37.444
last one left.

30:37.487 --> 30:41.056
And a man's only as good
as his word.

30:41.100 --> 30:42.362
Oh, yeah.

30:42.405 --> 30:45.365
Life... has a funny way

30:45.408 --> 30:48.542
of slapping you
in the face sometimes.

30:57.507 --> 30:59.292
Thanks, Randy.
I'll take it from here.

30:59.335 --> 31:00.815
Mm-hmm.

31:03.949 --> 31:05.864
Here you go.

31:08.605 --> 31:12.914
All right. Your personal
effects. Let's go.

31:12.958 --> 31:14.829
I have to?

31:14.873 --> 31:17.397
Yeah, just be thankful
you're not going to jail.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.529
Jail would be safer.

31:19.573 --> 31:21.792
Deegan will find me.

31:21.836 --> 31:24.795
Rats never snitch twice.

31:24.839 --> 31:27.668
Go ahead.

31:33.630 --> 31:36.459
Okay. Thank you.

31:36.503 --> 31:38.592
For nothing.

31:38.635 --> 31:40.811
I have hit a brick wall
trying to figure out

31:40.855 --> 31:42.248
who owns
this machine.

31:42.291 --> 31:43.466
Sorry, Timbaland.

31:43.510 --> 31:45.425
This an
X-ray machine?

31:45.468 --> 31:46.905
Technically, an industrial

31:46.948 --> 31:48.645
radiology system.

31:48.689 --> 31:51.170
Sees through metal.Indeed, it does.

31:54.042 --> 31:55.957
What am I looking at?An image of the inside

31:56.001 --> 31:59.439
of the left side panel
of the vending machine.

31:59.482 --> 32:01.049
I think that's
the deadbolt.

32:01.093 --> 32:02.659
All right, let's say it is--
then what?

32:02.703 --> 32:05.140
Well, we unlock it.
All we have to do is move it

32:05.184 --> 32:06.750
two inches left.

32:06.794 --> 32:08.535
How? The bolt's
inaccessible.

32:08.578 --> 32:11.668
Unless you have the key.

32:11.712 --> 32:13.496
An internal magnet lock.

32:13.540 --> 32:16.499
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
Want to help me locate it?

32:16.543 --> 32:17.544
Absolutely.Okay.

32:17.587 --> 32:20.939
So, according
to the X-ray,

32:20.982 --> 32:23.115
the lock is 42 inches

32:23.158 --> 32:26.857
from the ground,
12 inches in from the front.

32:26.901 --> 32:28.337
Oh.

32:28.381 --> 32:30.122
Hmm...

32:30.165 --> 32:32.646
Ah.Yup, there it is,

32:32.689 --> 32:35.388
right there.

32:37.390 --> 32:39.348
Open. Open.

32:39.392 --> 32:41.176
Open...

32:42.699 --> 32:46.573
Oh, baby, we did it!
We are in!

32:46.616 --> 32:48.227
Nice job, Kasie.

32:48.270 --> 32:49.663
Ah!

32:49.706 --> 32:52.361
Okay, now, let's see what...

32:54.842 --> 32:56.670
Whoa.

33:04.199 --> 33:05.984
McGEE:
Kasie. Kasie, talk to me.

33:07.376 --> 33:10.031
Wake up.
Kasie, wake up.

33:10.075 --> 33:11.032
Call 911.

33:11.076 --> 33:12.381
Yes, sir.

33:12.425 --> 33:14.035
Kasie?

33:14.079 --> 33:15.384
Kasie, can you hear me?

33:15.428 --> 33:18.213
Why are you yelling?

33:18.257 --> 33:19.519
Oh, my God,
are you okay?

33:19.562 --> 33:22.348
Ow. I don't know.

33:22.391 --> 33:23.610
What happened?

33:23.653 --> 33:27.396
Oh! Oh, what happened
to my hands?

33:27.440 --> 33:29.224
That thing shocked me?No.

33:29.268 --> 33:30.573
It electrocuted you.

33:30.617 --> 33:32.358
Oh, damn.

33:32.401 --> 33:34.403
Oh, help me up.No, no, no.

33:34.447 --> 33:35.622
You're going to the hospital.

33:35.665 --> 33:38.668
That's a better idea.

33:38.712 --> 33:41.062
Hey, look.
I knocked the power out.

33:41.106 --> 33:44.065
That thing's defenseless.
You can look inside.

33:44.109 --> 33:46.285
Nice job, Kasie.

33:46.328 --> 33:48.156
Ow.

33:48.200 --> 33:50.245
GIBBS:
Hey, how's Kasie?

33:50.289 --> 33:53.988
Uh, okay. Doctors say that
she'll recover. She just needs

33:54.032 --> 33:55.250
some rest and less electricity.

33:55.294 --> 33:57.296
I'm glad you were there, McGee.

33:57.339 --> 33:59.167
Yeah, me too.
How was your field trip?

34:00.212 --> 34:01.517
What do we got?

34:01.561 --> 34:03.737
Uh, well, we hacked into

34:03.780 --> 34:05.434
the vending
machine's CPU,

34:05.478 --> 34:07.349
and it's connected to a
network of eight others

34:07.393 --> 34:10.091
around D.C. All act as
regular vending machines,

34:10.135 --> 34:12.485
selling junk food, but

34:12.528 --> 34:14.095
also, as it turns out...

34:14.139 --> 34:16.184
something else.

34:16.228 --> 34:19.274
They are called
Kicker Mintz.

34:19.318 --> 34:20.449
Yes, I can see that.

34:20.493 --> 34:22.364
What am I doing
holding a box of mints?

34:22.408 --> 34:25.367
Well, it's not real.
It's a fake product,

34:25.411 --> 34:26.586
designed to hide what's inside.

34:28.153 --> 34:29.893
Oxycodone.12 pills.

34:29.937 --> 34:32.548
40 milligrams each.
You put $300 in the machine,

34:32.592 --> 34:34.376
you get a container.We pulled three grand

34:34.420 --> 34:36.378
out of the machine's
money processor.

34:36.422 --> 34:39.294
Which explains all of
the high-tech security.

34:39.338 --> 34:41.079
Pretty ingenious way
to sell drugs--

34:41.122 --> 34:43.385
prescription pills
hidden in plain sight,

34:43.429 --> 34:44.908
positioned
all over the city.

34:44.952 --> 34:46.127
We got prints?

34:46.171 --> 34:47.346
We found one
on the inside of the glass.

34:47.389 --> 34:48.347
I'm waiting on a hit now.

34:48.390 --> 34:50.000
We also
pulled touch DNA

34:50.044 --> 34:52.177
off of one of
the Kicker Mintz containers.

34:52.220 --> 34:53.874
Running STR analysis now.

34:53.917 --> 34:55.876
You two can do all this
without Kasie?

34:55.919 --> 34:58.096
KASIE:
No, they can't.

34:58.139 --> 34:59.575
But they're helping.

34:59.619 --> 35:01.534
She insisted
on coming back, boss.

35:01.577 --> 35:03.579
Nuh-uh.
Doctor said rest.

35:03.623 --> 35:05.146
I am resting.

35:05.190 --> 35:07.366
Watch as I deliver
this fantastic news

35:07.409 --> 35:09.019
in a very calm manner.

35:09.063 --> 35:10.064
Little help?

35:10.108 --> 35:12.110
Yeah, sure.

35:12.153 --> 35:15.504
All right. Okay.

35:15.548 --> 35:17.419
Grazie.Mm-hmm.

35:17.463 --> 35:18.942
We got a hit on the DNA.

35:18.986 --> 35:21.684
BISHOP:
Oh. Blond guy's name is

35:21.728 --> 35:23.295
Oliver Sherry.

35:23.338 --> 35:26.080
Bishop, with me.
McGee, get an address.Working on it.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.387
Kasie, go home.

35:28.430 --> 35:30.867
Oh, yeah, I'm fried.

35:34.001 --> 35:36.438
Oliver Sherry.

35:36.482 --> 35:38.962
Convictions for assault,
armed robberies,

35:39.006 --> 35:40.312
et cetera, et cetera.

35:40.355 --> 35:42.488
Eh, he's just another
Deegan stooge.

35:42.531 --> 35:44.316
I want the man himself.

35:44.359 --> 35:47.362
Hopefully Gibbs
can get this guy to turn.

35:53.412 --> 35:55.327
Not a good day for you, Oliver.

35:55.370 --> 35:57.546
Found you in possession
of hundreds of tablets

35:57.590 --> 35:59.592
of oxycodone.

35:59.635 --> 36:01.594
Yeah, I don't know
anything about that.

36:01.637 --> 36:03.161
I just load the machines.

36:03.204 --> 36:05.554
And deliver poisoned omelets.

36:05.598 --> 36:08.383
The agent that answered the door
already ID'd you.

36:11.865 --> 36:13.214
Well, if I don't follow orders,

36:13.258 --> 36:15.564
I'm the one gagging
on the poison omelet.

36:15.608 --> 36:17.610
Okay, so who gave the order?

36:17.653 --> 36:21.222
Forget it.

36:21.266 --> 36:24.399
I talk, I die.

36:24.443 --> 36:25.444
Then you
got a problem.

36:25.487 --> 36:28.621
'Cause here you are,
talking.

36:28.664 --> 36:31.232
And we're gonna make sure
that everybody knows about it.

36:31.276 --> 36:32.842
Or...

36:32.886 --> 36:35.584
you could walk
through door number two.

36:35.628 --> 36:37.586
Tell us what we need to know.

36:37.630 --> 36:39.675
And then we're gonna
take down your boss.

36:39.719 --> 36:42.374
And you'll live
to weasel another day.

36:44.027 --> 36:46.726
Going once, going twice,

36:46.769 --> 36:49.598
going...What do you want to know?

36:53.254 --> 36:54.429
Why did Lieutenant Johnson

36:54.473 --> 36:57.476
give you an envelope
full of cash?

36:57.519 --> 36:58.868
Vending machine screwed up.

36:58.912 --> 37:00.392
He bought a bag of peanuts

37:00.435 --> 37:04.352
and it gave him
600 bucks in change.

37:04.396 --> 37:07.660
Johnny Appleseed called
the 800 number to give it back.

37:07.703 --> 37:10.663
He started
asking questions.

37:10.706 --> 37:12.708
Could have blown the entire op.

37:12.752 --> 37:15.972
You guys are gonna
get me killed.

37:16.016 --> 37:18.105
Not if you are willing
to go on record

37:18.148 --> 37:20.629
and say that Deegan ordered
the hit on the lieutenant.

37:23.806 --> 37:26.592
Uh... Deegan?

37:28.028 --> 37:31.597
You think Michael Deegan
is my boss?

37:43.261 --> 37:44.610
Daddy's home.

37:44.653 --> 37:46.612
Welcome back, boss.

37:46.655 --> 37:49.267
Well played.

37:49.310 --> 37:52.313
Can't believe it.

37:52.357 --> 37:53.532
They actually let you walk.

37:53.575 --> 37:55.795
Well, of course they did.

37:55.838 --> 37:57.797
Did you ever doubt me?

37:57.840 --> 38:01.409
Only you could get away with
an attempted murder charge.

38:01.453 --> 38:03.933
You want something to eat,
something to drink?

38:03.977 --> 38:06.632
Come on, sit, sit.

38:06.675 --> 38:08.851
What about my machines?

38:08.895 --> 38:10.505
I want all the Kicker Mintz
cleared out.

38:10.549 --> 38:13.029
Oliver Sherry's already on it.

38:13.073 --> 38:15.510
Good.

38:15.554 --> 38:17.164
I have to lay low
for a little while.

38:17.207 --> 38:18.600
Not a problem.

38:18.644 --> 38:20.863
So what can I do?

38:23.605 --> 38:26.260
You...

38:26.304 --> 38:27.696
can walk out the back door.

38:31.396 --> 38:33.702
Why'd you talk to NCIS?

38:33.746 --> 38:35.965
Listen, I-I had
to talk to them, okay?

38:36.009 --> 38:39.142
They came in here.
I did not snitch.

38:39.186 --> 38:42.232
Please. Please, you
got to believe me.

38:42.276 --> 38:43.886
TORRES:
Go ahead and drop it.

38:48.413 --> 38:50.066
He was gonna kill me.

38:50.110 --> 38:51.938
I was-I was scared for my life.

38:51.981 --> 38:54.288
All right, boss.

38:59.685 --> 39:01.164
SYDNEY:
Jack Fontaine.

39:01.208 --> 39:03.776
The guy could sleep standing up.

39:06.996 --> 39:08.346
Max Sprague.

39:08.389 --> 39:10.783
Got shot twice
in a firefight

39:10.826 --> 39:12.828
and just...

39:16.484 --> 39:19.313
...he just kept coming.

39:20.575 --> 39:22.447
Albert Renquist.

39:22.490 --> 39:25.754
Five-foot tall, six-foot wife.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.889
Now L.J. Moore.

39:29.932 --> 39:31.891
Well, Leroy,

39:31.934 --> 39:34.807
we did it.

39:34.850 --> 39:38.245
The last man promise
is fulfilled.

39:41.030 --> 39:42.641
Not yet.

39:47.080 --> 39:49.299
This is for you, John.

39:51.345 --> 39:53.434
I don't understand.

39:53.478 --> 39:56.829
Where'd you get this?

39:56.872 --> 39:59.440
Did you make this?

40:01.486 --> 40:04.053
You make this?

40:06.578 --> 40:09.755
I-I don't know...
I don't know what to say.

40:17.763 --> 40:19.765
That's the last link.

40:22.332 --> 40:24.378
Well...

40:24.422 --> 40:26.728
now you're the last man.

40:36.434 --> 40:39.698
Are you sure?

40:41.177 --> 40:43.745
Yeah.

40:47.836 --> 40:51.623
I will make sure, John...

40:51.666 --> 40:54.060
that you are buried
with your brothers.

40:57.672 --> 40:58.804
Thanks.
