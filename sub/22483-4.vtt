♪ ♪

00:10.677 --> 00:13.596
So, Greg, looking forward
to Thanksgiving?

00:13.680 --> 00:15.807
Really? We're just gonna
talk about Thanksgiving

00:15.890 --> 00:17.392
after what you just did to me?

00:17.475 --> 00:18.893
I'm sorry. Next time,
I'll bring in

00:18.977 --> 00:21.604
someone with smaller fingers.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.189
We got your routine
blood tests back,

00:23.273 --> 00:24.816
and everything
looks totally normal,

00:24.899 --> 00:26.985
except for your
testosterone level.

00:27.068 --> 00:28.570
What's wrong
with my testosterone?

00:28.653 --> 00:30.947
It's off-the-charts high.
Not to get too technical,

00:31.031 --> 00:34.951
but imagine a graph
where the line is way, way up.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.995
Oh. Oh, uh, okay.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.538
Uh, well, what does that mean?

00:38.621 --> 00:39.956
We just keep an eye on it.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.416
There might be
some side effects,

00:41.499 --> 00:45.503
but mostly high "T" is just
something cool to brag about.

00:46.254 --> 00:47.547
Welcome to the club.

00:47.630 --> 00:49.382
(grunts)

00:49.466 --> 00:51.384
Thanks for breaking me
the news, Doc.

00:51.468 --> 00:53.845
And for the direct eye contact.

00:59.976 --> 01:02.187
You know, we have glasses.

01:02.270 --> 01:03.605
I got a lot of power

01:03.688 --> 01:05.190
surging through my body
right now, babe.

01:05.273 --> 01:06.232
It's better that I don't

01:06.316 --> 01:08.151
put my hands on anything
that could break.

01:08.234 --> 01:11.279
Except, of course,
for this pretty little lady.

01:11.362 --> 01:14.866
Whoa. I like sweaty Greg

01:14.949 --> 01:17.327
-when he doesn't have a fever.
-Yeah?

01:17.410 --> 01:19.287
But we have to get to your
parents' house in ten minutes,

01:19.370 --> 01:20.955
-so...
-Well, then we better be quick.

01:22.499 --> 01:23.917
JEN:
Greg, the pie!

01:24.000 --> 01:25.752
Oh, my God.

01:25.835 --> 01:28.171
Whoa. I don't know
what's gotten into you,

01:28.254 --> 01:29.506
but Mommy likey.

01:29.589 --> 01:32.050
Do you mind
if we just get straight to it?

01:32.133 --> 01:35.303
Mind? I wanted that to be
one of our wedding vows.

01:35.386 --> 01:37.263
Ooh.

01:38.306 --> 01:40.100
Hey, Pops.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.601
You're looking good
in the deep "V."

01:41.684 --> 01:42.769
Hey, listen, next year,

01:42.852 --> 01:44.646
what do you say
we hunt our own turkey?

01:44.729 --> 01:46.940
Like the people that can chop
down their own Christmas trees.

01:47.023 --> 01:48.399
Oh, I don't know, son.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.068
I hit a pigeon in the war,

01:50.151 --> 01:52.737
and it's haunted me
more than the villages I bombed.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.447
Well, there were probably
a lot of pigeons

01:54.531 --> 01:55.782
in those villages, Dad.

01:55.865 --> 01:58.451
Oh, God.
I never thought about that.

01:59.536 --> 02:00.745
Hey, Pinky.

02:00.829 --> 02:01.830
You and Mom sharing
clothes again?

02:01.913 --> 02:03.998
Ha-ha. Very funny, Matthew,

02:04.082 --> 02:06.209
but we both know
Mom doesn't wear button-downs.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.836
Doesn't show off her figure.

02:07.919 --> 02:10.964
I'm gonna put this pie
in that kitchen,

02:11.047 --> 02:14.175
and then I am gonna
open up some jars.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.510
(whistling)

02:15.593 --> 02:17.971
What's with him?

02:18.054 --> 02:20.390
Oh. He got diagnosed
with high testosterone.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.934
Oh, so now he's Mr. Masculinity.

02:23.017 --> 02:24.435
Yeah. I mean,
it's all in his head.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.062
You know,
like his fear of clowns.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.148
But I don't have to suffer
through a circus,

02:28.231 --> 02:29.816
so in both cases, I win.

02:29.899 --> 02:33.069
(exhales) W-We don't
really need any herring, um,

02:33.153 --> 02:36.197
but I haven't been able
to open that jar since 1988.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.074
Whoa!

02:38.158 --> 02:39.576
Listen to that pop.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.661
Hey, uh, Dad says you need
me to change the lightbulb?

02:41.744 --> 02:43.288
-Yeah, honey...
-Oh. Let me do that, buddy.

02:43.371 --> 02:45.123
Why don't you go out
and play with Tyler.

02:45.206 --> 02:47.083
You don't think
I can change a lightbulb?

02:47.167 --> 02:49.085
Well, not without a step stool.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.504
Although, I guess I could
put you up on my shouldies.

02:51.588 --> 02:52.589
Dude,
what are you talking about?

02:52.672 --> 02:53.715
You're, like,
an inch taller than me.

02:53.798 --> 02:55.967
Two inches.
In every way that matters.

02:56.050 --> 02:58.094
-You know what I think
sounds like a good idea?
-What?

02:58.178 --> 02:59.971
Little Thanksgiving Day
family football.

03:00.054 --> 03:02.307
Eh... I don't think
that's a good idea.

03:02.390 --> 03:03.933
Well,
because of your dancer's hip

03:04.017 --> 03:05.435
or your delicate back?

03:05.518 --> 03:07.103
I don't want anybody
to get hurt.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.064
Mom, my back
is firing on all cylinders.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.567
I mean, just ask this pie.

03:12.650 --> 03:14.110
Actually, wait,
don't ask that pie.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.487
That's not a story
you're gonna want to hear.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.824
Hut.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.784
-TIM: Hold him...
-I can't! I...

03:21.868 --> 03:23.036
Here!

03:23.119 --> 03:24.537
(cheering)

03:26.789 --> 03:28.625
(grunts) Ugh!

03:30.960 --> 03:32.045
Really, man?

03:32.128 --> 03:34.839
Thought this was a family game.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.091
Hey, hey, he's got
a medical condition, dude.

03:37.175 --> 03:38.134
Yeah, he does.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.886
Touchdown, little man.

03:39.969 --> 03:41.512
You did your best, though.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.723
I'll show you my best, man.

03:43.806 --> 03:46.267
-Yeah.
-Set, hike!

03:46.351 --> 03:48.895
(groaning, yelling)

03:48.978 --> 03:50.647
-Oh.
-Ooh.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.440
(groans)

03:52.523 --> 03:53.483
Sorry about that, bro.

03:53.566 --> 03:54.984
My mind said, "Stop,"

03:55.068 --> 03:57.487
but my body said, "Keep huntin',

03:57.570 --> 03:59.239
'cause it's Matt season."

04:02.659 --> 04:04.452
What's wrong with your face?

04:04.535 --> 04:05.495
What?

04:05.578 --> 04:07.497
Are you breaking out?

04:07.580 --> 04:10.667
Oh, man, you got
some big-ass zits coming in.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.669
(laughing):
Oh...

04:12.752 --> 04:15.046
(quietly):
Honey.

04:15.129 --> 04:16.589
Do I have blemishes?

04:16.673 --> 04:18.841
Uh, yeah. But I got to say,

04:18.925 --> 04:21.844
kind of plays into
my delivery boy fetish.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.054
Oops.

04:23.137 --> 04:25.932
I don't have enough cash on me.

04:26.015 --> 04:27.517
Is that bad?

04:27.600 --> 04:29.852
Honey.
Do you have any concealer?

04:29.936 --> 04:32.397
Oh, no. You just lost it,
didn't you?

04:32.480 --> 04:33.439
Yeah.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.441
Yeah, acne's
a common side effect

04:35.525 --> 04:36.651
of high T.

04:36.734 --> 04:38.861
Next thing to go is the hair,
bro.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.863
Greg. Hey, man.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.157
High T, that's just a number.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.285
All right? That confidence
you were feeling?

04:45.368 --> 04:48.246
That didn't come from down
there. It came from up here.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.915
Wow. Thank you.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.041
Yeah. Here you go.

04:53.584 --> 04:55.295
(gasps)
Oh, God.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.299
Seriously? You went commando
on Thanksgiving?

04:59.382 --> 05:02.969
I had a lot more confidence
this morning.

05:03.052 --> 05:05.763
More acne going on back here.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.849
Oh...

05:12.645 --> 05:14.147
Wake up.

05:15.606 --> 05:17.608
It's 5:00 a.m., Mom.

05:17.692 --> 05:19.402
Colleen is sick.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.571
You're making
Thanksgiving dinner.

05:21.654 --> 05:25.116
No, no, no, no, no, no. You love
cooking Thanksgiving dinner.

05:25.199 --> 05:29.037
Not today. Today, I'm finally
watching the parade.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.913
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.957
You're right.
You're right. You're right.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.460
You've been working like crazy
ever since we all moved in,

05:35.543 --> 05:36.961
and I really appreciate that.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.589
And yeah, yeah, I'm on it.

05:39.672 --> 05:40.965
-(snoring)
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.926
You don't get
to go back to sleep.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.928
I get to go back to sleep.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.514
Okay. Yes, so excited.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.600
Happy Thanksgiving to you.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.186
Oh, dear.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.395
Mm. Come back to bed, Heater.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.230
Oh! Help!

05:56.314 --> 05:58.775
No, no. Tim, it's not Heather!

05:58.858 --> 06:00.234
MAN:
<i>Now, we're going to let it sit out.</i>

06:00.318 --> 06:02.236
<i>Allowing the bird to air-dry</i>

06:02.320 --> 06:04.572
<i>-will give it a crispy...</i>
-Oh! Ah! Crispy!

06:04.655 --> 06:07.075
-Hey! Woo-hoo!
-Crispy! Yeah!

06:07.158 --> 06:08.659
Oh! So many of you.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.995
Oh, and you invited a man
from the Internet.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.622
Yeah, you just missed
the lady who showed us

06:12.705 --> 06:13.915
how to use a rolling pin.

06:13.998 --> 06:15.375
Turns out she wasn't
even cooking.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.378
Oh, honey, I left you
all my recipe cards.

06:18.461 --> 06:19.754
Oh, no, we don't need them.

06:19.837 --> 06:21.214
See, I'm a really
spiritual cook.

06:21.297 --> 06:23.674
I like to ask the food
what it wants to be.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.968
Yeah, don't worry,
she's just in charge of ice.

06:26.052 --> 06:30.014
Okay, well, you... have a plan.

06:30.098 --> 06:33.309
And so no matter what happens,
it will be good.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.061
-Thanks, Mom.
-MAN: <i>Crispy.</i>

06:35.144 --> 06:36.145
Oh. Crispy!

06:36.229 --> 06:38.231
ALL:
Crispy!

06:38.314 --> 06:40.650
JOAN:
Oh, the Macy's Parade.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.277
Finally!
I've heard so much about it.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.363
WOMAN:
<i>We're here in New York City today,</i>

06:45.446 --> 06:47.365
<i>and holiday cheer is</i>
<i>definitely in the air.</i>

06:47.448 --> 06:50.076
-MAN: <i>That's right. It sure is.</i>
-Is it just balloons?

06:50.159 --> 06:52.453
Yup. Too bad
it's not windy, though.

06:52.537 --> 06:55.123
One year, Barney got stuck
in the power lines,

06:55.206 --> 06:58.334
and they had to stab him
in front of everyone.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.254
We had grief counselors
at school the next day.

07:01.337 --> 07:02.713
Well, where's Snoopy?

07:02.797 --> 07:04.966
I don't recognize
any of these characters.

07:05.049 --> 07:07.760
Me neither. Looks like they're
all fourth-generation Pokémon.

07:07.844 --> 07:10.471
I only consider the first three
generations to be canon.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.265
You know, it's really hard
for people to see the balloons

07:12.348 --> 07:14.183
when other people are talking.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.769
Well, when I was
a child, you know,

07:16.853 --> 07:18.855
our department store
had a parade,

07:18.938 --> 07:20.857
-but there were no balloons.
-(TV volume increases)

07:20.940 --> 07:23.568
Th-There was just
children in wagons,

07:23.651 --> 07:25.653
and soldiers.

07:25.736 --> 07:26.696
Mm.

07:26.779 --> 07:29.073
-It was World War Two.
-Mm-hmm.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.118
Is that boiling water?

07:32.201 --> 07:35.246
Oh, yes. It's for my
traditional Thanksgiving bath.

07:35.329 --> 07:38.958
This year, I'm filling it pot
by pot, like the pilgrims did.

07:39.041 --> 07:40.209
-Oh...
-Mm-hmm.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.003
Maybe I could finally join you.

07:42.086 --> 07:45.256
I'm up for some
Thanksgiving fun.

07:45.339 --> 07:50.136
Oh, my traditional bath is-is
not a sexual thing, Joanie.

07:50.219 --> 07:51.679
It's more spiritual.

07:51.762 --> 07:53.723
-Oh.
-Please respect that.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.308
-Hmm?
-Yeah.

07:57.059 --> 07:59.562
♪ <i>Stop, can't you see</i>
<i>what you doing, girl? </i>♪

07:59.645 --> 08:02.023

08:07.153 --> 08:09.363
Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!

08:09.447 --> 08:11.032
Heather!

08:11.115 --> 08:13.493
Those pinches are like punches.

08:13.576 --> 08:16.078
Your hands are very powerful.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.915
I know. Do you remember
my water polo coach said

08:18.998 --> 08:21.000
I could've totally played
for the boys' team?

08:21.083 --> 08:24.337
Hey, you should go outside.
Yeah, get out of here, have fun.

08:24.420 --> 08:25.880
Matt and Greg are out there,
they're playing football.

08:25.963 --> 08:28.633
Do they let people talk
wh-while they watch?

08:28.716 --> 08:30.218
TIM (shouting):
Keep it down in there!

08:30.301 --> 08:33.554
I can't see Hello Kitty!

08:33.638 --> 08:35.723
Hey, is it just me,
or is it really weird

08:35.806 --> 08:37.725
-that she's just watching us?
-Yup.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.227
Go, Greg!

08:41.854 --> 08:43.022
Matt!

08:45.399 --> 08:48.110
Wow. All that extra
testosterone,

08:48.194 --> 08:49.987
you still can't throw
a spiral, huh?

08:52.365 --> 08:54.408
I can do that now. Quick kick.

08:56.702 --> 08:58.538
-Seriously, dude?
-Dude, you can't handle this T.

08:58.621 --> 09:01.040
You can't even catch this T.
Check this out.

09:01.123 --> 09:03.459
See? See?

09:03.543 --> 09:05.086
MATT:
Mom, tell him to stop running!

09:05.169 --> 09:06.254
Oh, trust me,
you don't even want...

09:06.337 --> 09:08.214
This seemed like
so much more fun

09:08.297 --> 09:10.299
from the kitchen window.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.385
-(lid rattling)
-JOAN: Oh!

09:12.468 --> 09:15.346
The pot's about to boil over!

09:15.429 --> 09:18.266
Wow, I got here just in time.

09:18.349 --> 09:20.893
Mom, it's okay, that's
just Dad's bathwater.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.603
We got everything
covered in here.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.147
-You do?
-Yeah.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.732
It's Thanksgiving:
The Re-Remix.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.276
(imitates record scratching)
That's our theme.

09:28.359 --> 09:31.112
Oh, yeah. Everybody's placemat
is a vinyl record.

09:31.195 --> 09:33.406
Mm-hmm. I wasn't super
into it at first.

09:33.489 --> 09:34.991
And I'm still not.

09:35.074 --> 09:37.868
Well... Maybe our theme
should just be "Thanksgiving"?

09:37.952 --> 09:39.287
(laughs) Mom, don't be crazy.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.871
That's our theme
for Christmas dinner.

09:40.955 --> 09:43.082
Get outside, go have fun.

09:43.165 --> 09:46.210
There is no fun.

09:46.294 --> 09:49.213
The activities
in this family suck!

09:49.297 --> 09:51.424
I mean, cooking is what I do,
and I thought,

09:51.507 --> 09:53.342
"Oh, I can live without this."

09:53.426 --> 09:55.469
But I can't.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.806
Not unless we get
better people in this family.

09:58.889 --> 10:00.808
-I'm sorry.
-JEN: I mean, if I would've known

10:00.891 --> 10:02.893

would make you happy,

-Yeah.

10:04.645 --> 10:07.565

spending my entire day

10:07.648 --> 10:10.860
slaving over a hot stove
for my ungrateful family

10:10.943 --> 10:13.946
so I can complain about
how ungrateful they are

10:14.030 --> 10:17.825
is the true magic
of Thanksgiving.

10:17.908 --> 10:19.160
You know what, Mom?

10:19.243 --> 10:21.621
We're gonna get
out of your hair.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.748
The kitchen is yours.

10:23.831 --> 10:25.124

-Happy Thanksgiving, Joan.
-Happy Thanksgiving.

10:28.085 --> 10:31.339

stay and help me?

10:36.802 --> 10:39.388
I-I can't believe
you gave me a pot cookie!

10:39.472 --> 10:41.515
I'm sorry.
When my grandma said

10:41.599 --> 10:43.225
they were made with love,
I didn't know "Love"

10:43.309 --> 10:44.894
was the name
of the weed she buys.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.896
When does it kick in?
Does it make your arms heavy?

10:46.979 --> 10:48.272
'Cause mine are, like, heavy.

10:48.356 --> 10:52.109
I don't even remember
how heavy my arms used to be.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.487
We just have to get through
dinner, that's it.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.238
You're right.
And-and when dinner is over,

10:56.322 --> 10:57.698
I'll take a nap,
like everyone else,

10:57.782 --> 11:00.951
and-and sleep it off until...

11:01.035 --> 11:03.704
<i>How long have I been standing</i>
<i>here talking to myself?</i>

11:03.788 --> 11:05.915

Did you have fun at Jenna's?

11:48.916 --> 11:50.084
<i>(gasps) She knows.</i>

11:50.167 --> 11:51.794
Yes.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.797

11:54.880 --> 11:56.924
Talk like Yoda, she does.

Hey, Sam.

12:00.052 --> 12:03.055

-Hi-ya, champ.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.557

Lark! Well, as always,

12:08.728 --> 12:10.980
it's been lovely
almost eating a meal with you.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.648
Oh, no, Jen, sit down.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.608
Let-let Sam watch Lark.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.280

12:30.291 --> 12:32.877

you never had.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.587
Ouch.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.672
Here, I'll help Sam.

Dude, I don't know
what you smoked,

12:42.303 --> 12:44.472

if they find out.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.599

Also, do you have any more?

12:46.682 --> 12:48.601
-It's that obvious?
-Yeah.

12:48.684 --> 12:50.060

back in my house?

13:17.129 --> 13:20.508
I have no idea.

13:20.591 --> 13:22.343
I'm so sorry.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.682
Better not have used
my shell soaps.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.297

We must get out of our heads

19:01.098 --> 19:02.933
Sure, after I loosen
it up for him.

19:03.016 --> 19:04.184
Yeah, you did that.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.435
The knife has chosen!

19:05.519 --> 19:07.062
-(muffled): Yay for Tim!
-Yes!

19:07.146 --> 19:09.398
-Not sure I agree with the choice.
-Shh.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.775
I've never felt
so much power.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.861
-Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
-(knife whirring)

19:13.944 --> 19:16.613
Hey, thank you, John,
for the honor.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.866
I will not let you down,
any of you!

19:18.949 --> 19:19.908
-No!
-Okay.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.494
The Short family knife
is safe with me.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.790
(all screaming)

19:26.874 --> 19:28.375
-Oh, that is deep!
-Dad! Oh, my God!

19:29.877 --> 19:31.545
I see bone! I see bone!

19:31.628 --> 19:34.047
Oh! Oh, my God!
Shut it off! Greg!

19:34.131 --> 19:35.549
Shut off the knife!

19:35.632 --> 19:37.217
Yeah, okay!

19:37.301 --> 19:39.344
Ow! It's just raw wire!

19:39.428 --> 19:40.637
I'm gonna throw up!

19:40.721 --> 19:42.014
You're a doctor!

19:42.097 --> 19:45.058
It's ear, nose and throat,
not ear, nose and thumb!

19:45.142 --> 19:46.560
(clamoring continues)

19:48.145 --> 19:49.521
I'm calling an ambulance.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.982
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

19:52.065 --> 19:53.817
Sam, get some bandages!

19:53.901 --> 19:55.444
Samantha!

19:55.527 --> 19:58.780
Oh, right. Sorry, I thought
I already did this.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.325
Um, Thanksgiving.

20:01.408 --> 20:04.244
A time to give thanks for
the big things in life, like...

20:04.328 --> 20:06.079
-John!
-I got this.

20:06.163 --> 20:08.624
The knife's not gonna hurt me.

20:08.707 --> 20:10.500
-...corn...
-I'm going down.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.502
-HEATHER: No, you're not.
-TIM: I'm going down.

20:12.586 --> 20:14.379
Aah! It's gone rogue!

20:14.463 --> 20:16.381
-Happy Thanksgiving.
-(groaning)

20:16.465 --> 20:18.050
-Kill it!
-I can't get it!

20:19.134 --> 20:20.052
Kill it!

20:20.135 --> 20:22.429
Yeah! God!

20:22.512 --> 20:23.931
-(whirring stops)
-(laughs)

20:28.977 --> 20:30.270
Hey, John.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.648
What has one usable thumb

20:32.731 --> 20:35.400
and wants to apologize for
ruining Thanksgiving dinner?

20:35.484 --> 20:37.194
And dessert.

20:37.277 --> 20:39.905
I mean, you plunged your bloody
hand into the ice cream.

20:39.988 --> 20:42.491
I don't remember that.
I must've blacked out.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.034
We-we ate around it.

20:44.117 --> 20:46.328
Anyway, I'm sorry.

20:46.411 --> 20:47.829
I can't accept this.

20:47.913 --> 20:50.540
Maybe later I'll be able
to earn the right to...

20:50.624 --> 20:51.959
Ooh. Aah!

20:52.042 --> 20:54.461
-Aah!
-My toe! Oh!

20:54.461 --> 20:56.838
