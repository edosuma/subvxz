00:01.201 --> 00:03.602
{\an5}<i>Previously on</i> Young Sheldon...

00:01.201 --> 00:03.602
Billy!

00:03.670 --> 00:05.438
Mr. Cooper is here.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.375
How you doing?

00:08.441 --> 00:11.077
Do not look under that rock.

00:12.178 --> 00:14.247
But I appreciate you asking.

00:14.314 --> 00:16.049
Hey, you got rejected.

00:16.116 --> 00:17.784
But was it the end of the world?

00:17.851 --> 00:19.386
No.

00:19.452 --> 00:21.354
And that is
extremely valuable information.

00:21.421 --> 00:22.689
And honestly...

00:22.756 --> 00:25.091
you dodged a bullet with Missy.

00:25.158 --> 00:26.726
The girl is mean.

00:26.793 --> 00:28.762
Thanks.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.369
(indistinct chatter, clamoring)

00:36.436 --> 00:37.771
WOMAN:
Come on, Missy!

00:37.837 --> 00:39.339
{\an5}Hey.

00:37.837 --> 00:39.339
Hey!

00:39.406 --> 00:41.741
{\an8}Came to see your man be
a leader of little people, huh?

00:41.808 --> 00:44.511
{\an7}I came to see
my granddaughter pitch.

00:44.577 --> 00:46.045
{\an9}Yeah, under
my leadership.

00:46.112 --> 00:48.181
{\an9}All right, Cooper,
let's see what you got.

00:48.248 --> 00:49.449
{\an8}Come on, girl!

00:52.352 --> 00:53.686
{\an8}Come on, shake it off!

00:53.753 --> 00:55.422
{\an8}You got this.

00:59.492 --> 01:01.494
{\an8}What the hell was that?

01:01.561 --> 01:03.430
{\an7}Well, there's
some leadership.

01:06.533 --> 01:08.301
{\an9}DALE:
Time!

01:08.368 --> 01:09.569
{\an8}Cooper!

01:09.636 --> 01:10.570
{\an8}Time!

01:10.637 --> 01:13.606
{\an8}Cooper, what is the problem?

01:13.673 --> 01:15.775
{\an8}The ball isn't going
where it's supposed to.

01:15.842 --> 01:16.843
{\an8}I saw that.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.144
{\an8}What am I doing wrong?

01:18.211 --> 01:20.246
{\an8}Just a little case of the yips.

01:20.313 --> 01:22.482
{\an8}It happens.

01:20.313 --> 01:22.482
{\an8}What's that?

01:22.549 --> 01:24.651
{\an9}The yips-- you know,
it's when you're thinking

01:24.717 --> 01:26.286
{\an8}about stuff in your head

01:26.352 --> 01:28.254
{\an8}and something you've
done a million times,

01:28.321 --> 01:31.124
{\an9}you can't do it anymore.
Even the pros get it.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.159
{\an8}How do I get rid of it?

01:33.226 --> 01:35.428
{\an8}Uh, just don't think about it.

01:35.495 --> 01:37.263
{\an8}Okay.

01:38.398 --> 01:40.600
{\an7}(sighs)

01:42.735 --> 01:45.271
{\an8}Don't think, just throw.

01:48.475 --> 01:49.676
{\an8}(crowd clamoring)

01:49.742 --> 01:52.345
{\an8}I hate the little people.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.907
{\an8}BRENDA:
Damn it!

02:20.974 --> 02:22.375
{\an8}Brenda?

02:22.442 --> 02:23.710
{\an7}What?

02:23.776 --> 02:25.345
{\an8}Everything okay over there?

02:25.411 --> 02:27.180
{\an7}Oh, yeah.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.315
{\an8}Okay.

02:29.382 --> 02:30.350
{\an8}(engine sputtering)

02:30.416 --> 02:31.618
{\an7}Damn it!

02:32.519 --> 02:34.220
{\an8}Okay, give her a go.

02:34.287 --> 02:36.322
{\an8}(engine starts)

02:37.423 --> 02:38.892
{\an8}You're a lifesaver.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.528
{\an8}It's a gift.

02:41.861 --> 02:44.297
{\an8}Can I offer you a beer
and some thank-you cobbler?

02:44.364 --> 02:46.466
{\an8}Weren't you
on your way somewhere?

02:46.533 --> 02:48.368
{\an8}Weight Watchers.

02:48.434 --> 02:49.536
{\an8}(laughs)

02:49.602 --> 02:50.803
{\an8}What do you say?

02:50.870 --> 02:52.939
{\an8}Eh, sure.

02:54.641 --> 02:56.776
{\an8}Do guys ever go to those
Weight Watchers meetings?

02:56.843 --> 02:59.245
{\an8}Yeah, but they're all fat.

02:59.312 --> 03:00.847
{\an9}(laughs)

03:00.914 --> 03:03.583
{\an8}ADULT SHELDON:
<i>Of all the tests</i>
<i>one takes in school,</i>

03:03.650 --> 03:06.452
{\an8}<i>my favorite was the midterm.</i>

03:06.519 --> 03:07.854
{\an8}<i>Finals weren't bad,</i>

03:07.921 --> 03:09.589
{\an8}<i>but they also meant</i>
<i>summer was approaching.</i>

03:09.656 --> 03:12.425
{\an8}<i>I don't believe in religion,</i>
<i>but sunshine,</i>

03:12.492 --> 03:14.193
{\an8}<i>picnics and pool parties</i>

03:14.260 --> 03:15.762
{\an8}<i>are proof hell exists.</i>

03:15.828 --> 03:17.697
{\an8}(nearby thud)

03:20.833 --> 03:22.936
{\an8}(door thuds)

03:26.039 --> 03:27.473
{\an8}Aah!

03:27.540 --> 03:28.708
{\an8}Why are you trying to hit me?

03:28.775 --> 03:30.777
{\an8}I'm trying to hit the target.

03:30.843 --> 03:31.878
{\an8}It's over there.

03:31.945 --> 03:34.347
{\an8}I know, dingus.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.318
{\an8}I thought you were good at this.

03:38.384 --> 03:39.018
{\an7}I was.

03:39.085 --> 03:41.688
{\an8}Coach Dale says I have the yips.

03:41.754 --> 03:43.523
{\an8}It's not contagious, is it?

03:43.590 --> 03:45.658
{\an8}No, it happens in sports.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.227
{\an8}Suddenly you can't do a thing
that used to be easy.

03:48.294 --> 03:49.829
{\an8}It doesn't sound real.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.798
{\an8}Then why can't I pitch anymore?

03:51.864 --> 03:53.733
{\an8}Ooh, perhaps
it's the onset of puberty

03:53.800 --> 03:55.935
{\an8}and the hysterical mood swings
that go with it.

03:56.002 --> 03:57.570
{\an8}Dingus, house.

03:57.637 --> 03:59.639
{\an8}You're only proving my point.

04:03.776 --> 04:05.645
{\an8}What, Billy won an award?

04:05.712 --> 04:08.014
{\an8}Participation.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.282
{\an8}Big whoop.

04:09.349 --> 04:10.650
{\an8}I guess it's something.

04:10.717 --> 04:12.018
{\an7}Well, he ain't
the sharpest pencil in the box,

04:12.085 --> 04:14.487
{\an8}but he's the sweetest kid
I know.

04:14.554 --> 04:16.623
{\an8}Well, Sheldon is
the sharpest pencil.

04:16.689 --> 04:18.491
{\an8}Sometimes I'd just like

04:18.558 --> 04:19.993
{\an8}to shove his head in that box.

04:20.059 --> 04:22.528
{\an5}(chuckles)

04:20.059 --> 04:22.528
Where's your trash?

04:22.595 --> 04:23.763
{\an8}Everywhere.

04:23.830 --> 04:26.499
{\an8}But the basket's under the sink.

04:23.830 --> 04:26.499
{\an9}Mm.

04:27.634 --> 04:29.836
{\an8}(exhales)

04:29.902 --> 04:31.771
{\an8}You know your faucet's leaking?

04:31.838 --> 04:34.374
{\an8}Yep, this whole place is
falling apart.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.541
{\an8}Well...

04:35.608 --> 04:37.744
{\an8}I'll come over another time,
and take care of it.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.744
{\an4}Oh.

04:37.810 --> 04:39.712
{\an7}You know, you don't
have to do that.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.381
One more?

04:42.081 --> 04:44.517
I should get going.

04:44.584 --> 04:46.386
Well, thanks again.

04:48.721 --> 04:51.057
Want to buy a house?

04:51.924 --> 04:52.859
(door opens)

04:52.925 --> 04:54.560
{\an1}Hey,
where you been?

04:54.627 --> 04:56.963
Ah, Brenda was having
car trouble.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.464
{\an5}Just giving her hand.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.464
That's nice.

04:58.531 --> 05:00.867
I'm sure it's hard
being by herself.

05:00.933 --> 05:02.335
{\an3}Yeah.

05:02.402 --> 05:03.836
That whole house is
in need of repair.

05:03.903 --> 05:05.905
I hope you offered
to help her out.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.874
I did... she said no.

05:07.940 --> 05:09.876
Well, that's
just her being proud.

05:09.942 --> 05:12.045
Of course she wants your help.

05:13.413 --> 05:16.349
(stammers)
I guess some time I'll pop over.

05:16.416 --> 05:17.817
Good.

05:17.884 --> 05:19.952
And when you go,
hitch up your pants.

05:20.019 --> 05:22.055
There's a lot going on
when you squat.

05:22.121 --> 05:23.756
LINKLETTER:
<i>All right.</i>

05:23.823 --> 05:25.058
You have 45 minutes to complete

05:25.124 --> 05:27.093
{\an1}the test,
eyes on your own paper and...

05:27.160 --> 05:30.329
{\an1}Yes, Sheldon, if you finish
early, you can take it again.

05:30.396 --> 05:31.631
{\an1}And...

05:31.698 --> 05:32.865
begin!

05:32.932 --> 05:34.033
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>And I was off.</i>

05:34.100 --> 05:35.868
<i>I flew through wave functions.</i>

05:35.935 --> 05:37.904
<i>I dominated</i>
<i>harmonic oscillators.</i>

05:37.970 --> 05:39.906
<i>The only challenging part</i>
<i>of this exam</i>

05:39.972 --> 05:42.475
<i>was trying to balance</i>
<i>the desire to finish quickly</i>

05:42.542 --> 05:45.478
{\an3}<i>with the urge to stop and smell</i>
<i>my freshly sharpened pencil.</i>

05:46.479 --> 05:47.547
<i>Mmm.</i>

05:47.613 --> 05:49.048
<i>I was in the zone.</i>

05:49.115 --> 05:50.850
<i>Only one question left.</i>

05:50.917 --> 05:52.051
<i>All I needed to do</i>

05:52.118 --> 05:54.020
<i>was solve Schrodinger's equation</i>

05:54.087 --> 05:56.589
<i>in a cylindrical well</i>
<i>by employing the zeroes</i>

05:56.656 --> 05:58.758
<i>of the Bessel function,</i>
<i>which of course were...</i>

06:00.660 --> 06:02.528
Wait, what are they?

06:02.595 --> 06:03.963
<i>Come on, you know this.</i>

06:04.030 --> 06:06.032
<i>You've done it a million times.</i>

06:07.500 --> 06:09.702
Oh, dear.

06:17.543 --> 06:19.879
All right, Sheldon,
time to turn in your test.

06:19.946 --> 06:21.047
I'm not done yet.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.116
(sighs)
I know you like to add

06:23.182 --> 06:25.451
your own "better questions"
at the end,

06:25.518 --> 06:27.053
but for the last time,
I don't count them.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.789
I just need a few more
minutes on this problem.

06:29.856 --> 06:31.157
That's an easy one.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.859
Just apply the zeroes
of the Bessel function.

06:32.925 --> 06:34.594
I know what I have to do.

06:34.660 --> 06:35.995
Is this is a tantrum?

06:36.062 --> 06:37.797
I've heard children your age
like to throw them.

06:37.864 --> 06:39.732
I can't remember what the zeroes

06:39.799 --> 06:41.601
of the Bessel function are.

06:41.667 --> 06:42.735
You didn't memorize them?

06:42.802 --> 06:44.904
Of course I did--
October 7, 1988.

06:44.971 --> 06:46.606
I had just had
a bowl of Teddy Grahams.

06:46.672 --> 06:48.074
Then what's the problem?

06:48.708 --> 06:51.611
I'm blanking, but I'll get it.

06:51.677 --> 06:52.712
Sorry, son, class is over.

06:52.779 --> 06:54.046
No, I can do this.

06:54.113 --> 06:56.048
It's just one question.
You'll still pass.

06:56.115 --> 06:58.551
Sheldon Cooper doesn't
"just pass."

06:58.618 --> 06:59.886
I have an idea.

06:59.952 --> 07:01.187
Let me see the test.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.022
Thank you.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.424
Sheldon Cooper isn't always

07:05.491 --> 07:06.859
{\an5}that gullible.

07:05.491 --> 07:06.859
He was today.

07:12.565 --> 07:15.001
All right, almost there.

07:15.067 --> 07:17.170
{\an1}Hand me
a screwdriver.

07:17.236 --> 07:18.971
{\an3}Don't stick this
in an outlet.

07:19.038 --> 07:20.506
It really tingles.

07:21.140 --> 07:23.543
{\an5}We had an incident.

07:21.140 --> 07:23.543
{\an1}Yeah.

07:23.609 --> 07:25.878
You know what?

07:25.945 --> 07:27.079
Why don't you fix it?

07:27.146 --> 07:28.614
{\an5}BOTH:
Really?

07:27.146 --> 07:28.614
Yeah, you see

07:28.681 --> 07:29.382
that little screw there?

07:29.448 --> 07:30.917
{\an1}Just go ahead
and tighten her up.

07:30.983 --> 07:32.985
{\an1}Like this?
Yep.

07:33.052 --> 07:35.788
{\an1}BILLY:
What now?

07:35.855 --> 07:37.657
Uh, run outside
and turn the water back on.

07:37.723 --> 07:39.892
Here, I'm not allowed
to run with this.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.895
We've had a lot of incidents.

07:44.564 --> 07:46.532
{\an5}Who knew you were so handy?

07:44.564 --> 07:46.532
{\an1}Yeah.

07:46.599 --> 07:48.701
There's just things
guys need to be good at.

07:48.768 --> 07:50.736
What else you good at?

07:51.637 --> 07:53.472
{\an8}(water sputters)

07:53.539 --> 07:55.041
I should go.

07:58.644 --> 07:59.912
(door closes)

07:59.979 --> 08:01.848
Hey, pretty lady.

08:01.914 --> 08:04.083
{\an5}Are you drinking already?

08:01.914 --> 08:04.083
(laughs) No!

08:04.150 --> 08:06.853
Can't a guy give
his wife a compliment?

08:06.919 --> 08:08.588
Do I have to smell your breath?

08:08.654 --> 08:10.056
How about a kiss instead?

08:10.122 --> 08:11.591
What is with you?

08:11.657 --> 08:12.992
Well, I don't know.

08:13.059 --> 08:15.094
Kids aren't home.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.864
Now? I'm doing laundry.

08:17.930 --> 08:19.198
Laundry can wait.

08:19.265 --> 08:20.733
So can your thing.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.201
I like to think of it
as <i> our</i> thing,

08:22.268 --> 08:25.271
but if you only have time
for my thing, that's fine, too.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.206
You're being weird.

08:27.273 --> 08:29.041
Weird sexy?

08:29.108 --> 08:30.142
No.

08:30.209 --> 08:32.178
{\an5}Headed to the bedroom?

08:30.209 --> 08:32.178
No!

08:32.245 --> 08:34.647
Just checking.

08:35.681 --> 08:36.716
(sighs)

08:36.782 --> 08:38.784
SHELDON:
Missy!

08:38.851 --> 08:40.953
You gave me your yips.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.020
What?

08:42.087 --> 08:43.956
I froze on a test.
That's never happened before.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.157
It's all your fault.

08:45.224 --> 08:46.792
I told you it's not contagious.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.027
You put the thought in my head.

08:48.094 --> 08:49.729
The power of suggestion is
very real.

08:49.795 --> 08:51.797
Case in point: tulip mania.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.766
{\an5}Here we go.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.766
{\an3}Tulip mania

08:53.833 --> 08:55.601
was an insane desire
to buy and trade

08:55.668 --> 08:57.003
tulip bulbs in the 1600s.

08:57.069 --> 08:58.838
It nearly ruined
the Dutch economy.

08:58.905 --> 09:00.806
You would not believe
the gilders they were spending.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.608
How can you remember
this stupid information,

09:02.675 --> 09:04.143
but not the stuff on your test?

09:04.210 --> 09:05.645
You tell me, they're your yips.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.546
Sheldon, if I knew
how to make it stop,

09:07.613 --> 09:08.814
I would tell you.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.583
{\an3}You better.

09:10.650 --> 09:13.119
Maybe it's puberty
making you all emotional.

09:13.185 --> 09:15.321
I checked my armpits--
smooth as balloons.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.290
(groans)

09:18.624 --> 09:20.793
Hey.
(groans)

09:21.727 --> 09:22.895
What's your problem?

09:22.962 --> 09:24.263
I don't want to talk about it.

09:24.330 --> 09:26.632
{\an6}Great.

09:24.330 --> 09:26.632
I had a mental block

09:26.699 --> 09:28.000
{\an1}on a test
and it was something that

09:28.067 --> 09:29.135
I absolutely know how to do.

09:29.201 --> 09:31.837
Oh, you know, that sort of thing
happens in sports, too.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.105
I know. It's called the yips,

09:33.172 --> 09:34.206
and it's a very silly name

09:34.273 --> 09:35.741
for a very serious problem.

09:35.808 --> 09:37.610
Well, you know,
the best thing to do

09:37.677 --> 09:39.312
is get out of your head.

09:40.146 --> 09:41.180
How do I do that?

09:41.247 --> 09:42.915
Just turn your brain off.

09:43.616 --> 09:45.217
It's like I'm not even your son.

09:45.284 --> 09:46.819
(sighs)
Look.

09:46.886 --> 09:48.754
I know you don't respect
what I do as a coach.

09:48.821 --> 09:50.089
Maybe you do know me.

09:50.156 --> 09:52.925
But this is a thing
I actually know about.

09:52.992 --> 09:54.961
{\an3}I've seen it happen
to my players.

09:55.027 --> 09:56.896
I've seen it happen
to pros in golf.

09:56.963 --> 09:58.264
In baseball.

09:58.331 --> 09:59.899
The answer is always the same.

09:59.966 --> 10:02.635
Stop thinking and
get out of your own way.

10:02.702 --> 10:05.037
I don't know how to do that.

10:05.771 --> 10:08.808
Have you ever heard
the Nike slogan "Just do it"?

10:08.874 --> 10:10.676
I'm familiar with the phrase
"let's do it,"

10:10.743 --> 10:12.645
uttered by Gary Gilmore,
the last person

10:12.712 --> 10:15.247
to be executed
by firing squad in America.

10:16.749 --> 10:19.652
Okay, well, it's a shoe slogan.

10:19.719 --> 10:21.954
And it's good advice.

10:22.021 --> 10:23.856
The answer is already
in your head.

10:23.923 --> 10:25.291
Don't think so hard.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.026
Just do it.

10:28.227 --> 10:29.695
I'll try.

10:29.762 --> 10:31.230
Good man.

10:31.831 --> 10:34.200
Another fun footwear slogan is
"I'm Buster Brown.

10:34.266 --> 10:36.635
"I live in a shoe.
That's my dog Tige.

10:36.702 --> 10:37.970
Look for him there, too."

10:38.037 --> 10:40.006
Mm, I think mine is
more helpful.

10:40.072 --> 10:41.907
Well, mine rhymes, so...

10:44.377 --> 10:46.979
{\an5}ADULT SHELDON:
<i>I decided to heed</i>
<i>my father's advice.</i>

10:47.046 --> 10:49.382
<i>I wasn't sure</i>
<i>how to turn off my brain.</i>

10:49.448 --> 10:52.151
<i>Thankfully,</i>
<i>I lived with an expert.</i>

10:52.218 --> 10:54.220
What's up?

10:54.286 --> 10:56.889
I've never really thought
about not thinking before.

10:56.956 --> 10:58.424
{\an3}Well, I'm asking you
to think about it.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.993
But I thought you were
interested in <i> not</i> thinking.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.728
I am. I want you
to think about not thinking,

11:02.795 --> 11:03.996
and then teach me how to do it.

11:04.063 --> 11:05.131
Do what?

11:05.197 --> 11:06.232
Not think.

11:06.298 --> 11:08.334
All right.

11:10.936 --> 11:12.338
This is tough.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.840
I'm good at not thinking,
but I don't think

11:14.907 --> 11:16.809
I can teach you how to not think
without thinking.

11:16.876 --> 11:19.078
Hmm, well, thank you for trying.

11:19.145 --> 11:20.746
Hold on!
What if you're thinking

11:20.813 --> 11:22.114
about something else instead?

11:22.181 --> 11:24.116
Would that count as thinking
or not thinking?

11:24.183 --> 11:26.218
I suppose
it's similar to the mantras

11:26.285 --> 11:28.154
extolled
by the sages of the east.

11:28.220 --> 11:30.089
It's a practice
that Swami Vivekananda

11:30.156 --> 11:32.158
called Japa Yoga
and it's intended to bring out

11:32.224 --> 11:35.027
a single-pointedness
of concentration.

11:36.395 --> 11:38.130
Sorry, I zoned out.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.299
{\an5}Ooh, tell me how.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.299
{\an1}Let's see.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.400
You were blabbering.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.302
It all started to blur together.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.804
And I was gone.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.105
At what point
did it start to happen?

11:46.172 --> 11:47.907
I don't know.
Say it again.

11:47.973 --> 11:48.908
I said I suppose

11:48.974 --> 11:50.209
it's similar to the mantras

11:50.276 --> 11:52.111
extolled
by the sages of the east.

11:52.178 --> 11:55.281
It's a practice that Swami
Vivekananda called Japa Yoga...

12:44.029 --> 12:45.231
Waste my morning?

12:45.297 --> 12:46.298
You did it.

12:46.365 --> 12:48.467
That toilet won't stop running.

12:48.534 --> 12:50.402
Have you tried
jiggling the handle?

12:50.469 --> 12:51.971
I jiggled it, wiggled it.

12:52.037 --> 12:53.339
Damn near had a baby with it.

12:53.405 --> 12:54.573
(chuckles)
Yeah, let me take a look.

12:54.640 --> 12:57.543
I was fixing to put some dinner
on, if you care to join me.

12:58.210 --> 13:00.012
I don't want to put you out.

13:00.079 --> 13:01.514
It's just frozen lasagna.

13:01.580 --> 13:04.483
But I'm going oven
instead of microwave,

13:04.550 --> 13:06.252
'cause you're company.
(chuckles)

13:06.318 --> 13:08.254
What are you doing?

13:08.320 --> 13:09.421
What do you mean?

13:09.488 --> 13:11.924
(scoffs)
You know what I mean.

13:13.425 --> 13:15.794
I was just trying to thank you.

13:15.861 --> 13:17.396
And you're the one
who offered

13:17.463 --> 13:19.098
to come over here
and fix things.

13:19.165 --> 13:20.299
I was being nice.

13:20.366 --> 13:21.367
So was I.

13:21.433 --> 13:23.102
Yeah, maybe a little too nice.

13:23.169 --> 13:25.104
There is no pleasing you.

13:25.171 --> 13:26.205
Well, I don't need this here.

13:26.272 --> 13:27.273
I can get fighting at my house.

13:27.339 --> 13:28.274
Then maybe you should go back

13:28.340 --> 13:29.808
to your house.

You leaving?

13:36.582 --> 13:38.083
You gonna fix the toilet?

13:38.150 --> 13:39.585
{\an5}No.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.585
Then I guess I'm not leaving.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.086
Thank you. Lasagna?

13:41.153 --> 13:42.855
Small piece.

13:51.197 --> 13:53.032
<i>I was also that smart.</i>

Too violent.

14:18.090 --> 14:19.325
(indistinct TV chatter)

14:19.391 --> 14:21.594
(chuckles) I don't think so.

{\an5}That was so much fun,

You want to talk about it?

Tell me about your

15:16.415 --> 15:18.951
tasted every Campbell's soup.

{\an3}(laughing):
Come on, Tom.

15:20.552 --> 15:22.354
I'm trying to live
vicariously here.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.023
{\an3}There's got to be
something good.

15:24.089 --> 15:27.026
{\an1}Let's see, I go hunting and
fishing whenever I feel like it.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.494
{\an3}Now we're getting
somewhere.

15:28.560 --> 15:31.964
{\an5}Spend my money
on whatever I want.
Mm.

15:32.031 --> 15:33.666
{\an3}What was the last
thing you got?

15:33.732 --> 15:36.502
Foreman fight on pay-per-view.

15:36.568 --> 15:39.938
{\an1}I ate a bucket of chicken
and watched it in my underwear.

15:40.005 --> 15:41.373
You lucky bastard.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.675
Uh-huh.
(chuckles)

15:42.741 --> 15:44.643
What about women?

15:44.710 --> 15:46.979
{\an1}(sighs)
Honestly...

15:47.046 --> 15:49.515
{\an1}it's tough to meet people
at this age.

15:49.581 --> 15:52.084
{\an3}No, come on, charming

15:52.151 --> 15:53.152

15:53.218 --> 15:54.353
{\an1}Sadly, this is
the best night out

15:54.420 --> 15:56.188
I've had in a long time.

15:56.255 --> 15:58.490
Yeah. Me, too.

15:59.124 --> 16:02.394
{\an1}But if you know anybody,
send them my way.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.596
(country song playing softly)

16:05.664 --> 16:08.067
Yeah, I'll think about.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.737
{\an1}You ever eat chicken
in your underwear?

16:11.804 --> 16:13.038
What do you think?

16:13.105 --> 16:15.140
{\an5}Yes.

16:13.105 --> 16:15.140
Yes.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.177
Ooh.

16:18.243 --> 16:20.279
{\an5}Little stand of evergreens
that lives right in here.

16:20.346 --> 16:22.648
I didn't know
Richard Simmons can paint.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.283
His name's Bob Ross.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.051
And he's oddly hypnotic.

16:26.118 --> 16:27.353
You're gonna paint?

16:27.419 --> 16:29.088
No, I just like watching him.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.622
{\an1}I can't explain it,
but his voice

16:30.689 --> 16:33.359
and demeanor are comforting,
like a hot beverage.

16:33.425 --> 16:35.461
Let's get crazy and, once again,

16:35.527 --> 16:38.030
{\an5}just pull it out, just like
we did the other one.

16:38.097 --> 16:39.365
Yawn.

16:39.431 --> 16:42.568
Barely touch, whisper.

16:42.634 --> 16:44.570
Just whisper light.

16:44.636 --> 16:46.171
Let it go.

16:46.238 --> 16:48.307
Let it go, no pressure.

16:48.374 --> 16:50.709
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>The yips are a cruel mistress.</i>

16:50.776 --> 16:54.179
<i>But thanks to a magical man</i>
<i>with a halo of curls,</i>

16:54.246 --> 16:57.750
<i>I was finally able to relax</i>
<i>and get out of my own head.</i>

16:57.816 --> 17:02.187
<i>Instead of freezing up,</i>
<i>I thought about happy integers.</i>

17:02.254 --> 17:04.589
<i>Fluffy little formulas</i>

17:04.656 --> 17:06.759
<i>and a sweet Bessel function</i>
<i>that just wants me</i>

17:06.825 --> 17:08.026
<i>to do my very best.</i>

17:08.093 --> 17:09.294
Done.

17:09.361 --> 17:10.628
Great, I can still make
my doubles match.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.297
Get out.

17:20.305 --> 17:21.173
{\an5}(crowd groaning)

17:20.305 --> 17:21.173
(sighs)
Damn it.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.742
{\an4}Hold it.
Time, time, time.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.742
UMPIRE: Time!

17:23.809 --> 17:25.743
I don't know
what I'm doing wrong.

17:25.810 --> 17:27.646
Ah, don't worry about it.
It's not your fault.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.248
{\an5}It isn't?

17:27.713 --> 17:29.248
No, I'm the one

17:29.314 --> 17:31.750
{\an1}that let a girl pitch.
It's my mistake.

17:31.817 --> 17:34.420
What? I've won so many games.

17:34.486 --> 17:35.554
Oh, that was then.

17:35.621 --> 17:37.256
Why are you being so mean?

17:37.322 --> 17:40.058
{\an1}Well, why are you getting
so emotional, like women do?

17:40.125 --> 17:42.161
{\an1}Maybe you ought to be
a cheerleader.

17:42.227 --> 17:44.062
You trying to make me mad?

17:44.129 --> 17:45.631
Is it working?
Yeah.

17:45.697 --> 17:46.799
Well, I tell you what,

17:46.865 --> 17:49.268
{\an1}picture my face
in the catcher's mitt.

17:49.334 --> 17:50.035
What?

17:50.102 --> 17:51.637
{\an1}Do I have to dumb it down
for you?

17:51.703 --> 17:53.772
Just do what I tell you.

17:53.839 --> 17:55.441
(sighs)

17:56.442 --> 17:59.178
(spectators calling out)

18:00.612 --> 18:02.281
(grunts)

18:02.347 --> 18:04.249
{\an5}Strike!

18:02.347 --> 18:04.249
Yes!

18:04.316 --> 18:07.419
Aw, don't get all hysterical,
little girl!

18:07.486 --> 18:09.188
{\an1}You suck!

18:09.254 --> 18:09.822
You suck!

18:09.888 --> 18:12.191
No! You suck!

18:12.691 --> 18:13.859
Strike!

18:14.560 --> 18:18.197
I am the leader
of the little people.
