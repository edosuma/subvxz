<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:04.379 --> 00:05.213
(yells)

00:05.296 --> 00:06.965
Was there ever anything about me

00:07.048 --> 00:09.217
that would lead you
to believe that I was, um...

00:10.343 --> 00:11.177
masculine?

00:11.261 --> 00:12.637
(laughs) You?

00:13.304 --> 00:15.015
Midge Dolson made a pass at me.

00:15.098 --> 00:17.392
All right, folks, the party's over.
You are under arrest.

00:19.811 --> 00:21.062
You did good work out there.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.814
I screwed up, and you know it.

00:22.897 --> 00:24.649
You get well. I need you back on the job.

00:25.066 --> 00:26.234
Is there anything I can--

00:26.317 --> 00:29.029
I suggest you make plans
for another career, J.D.

00:29.112 --> 00:32.657
I am going to personally recommend
your dismissal from the force.

00:32.741 --> 00:35.243
Half the stuff I know about undercover,
I learned from J.D.

00:35.326 --> 00:37.412
Nobody'd blame you
if you dumped him, you know.

00:37.495 --> 00:39.914
Hey, Pop, how's it going?
You feeling all right?

00:40.415 --> 00:42.917
If I was feeling all right,
I wouldn't be here.

00:43.001 --> 00:44.753
That's my daddy up there,

00:44.836 --> 00:46.379
and he's dying on me.

00:46.921 --> 00:49.632
And he won't even let me sit
in the same room with him.

00:49.716 --> 00:53.386
(sobbing)

00:53.470 --> 00:56.056
NARRATOR:
<i>And now, tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:57.432 --> 00:58.641
The final score isn't gonna mean much

00:58.725 --> 01:00.852
if the whole thing ends up
in a full-blown riot.

01:08.943 --> 01:10.737
All this smoke in here bother you?

01:10.820 --> 01:12.822
Move it or lose it at the elbow.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.533
He locked me out, he wouldn't let me in.
He's gonna kill them both.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.827
God's sake, somebody help me!

01:17.911 --> 01:18.745
Get in here!

01:18.828 --> 01:20.205
Mr. Reese, I wanna help you.

01:20.288 --> 01:21.539
It's too late, man.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.125
I'm over the line.

01:25.835 --> 01:27.670
PHIL:<i> Let's continue, people. Item Nine:</i>

01:29.214 --> 01:32.383
Uh, regarding, in fact,
the Pussycat Art House on Avenue B.

01:32.467 --> 01:35.428
-(whistling, clapping)
-The, uh, patrons of which

01:35.512 --> 01:39.641
have suffered over a half dozen recorded
holdups in the past two months alone.

01:39.724 --> 01:43.436
The complainants being most typically,
uh, middle-aged business types,

01:43.520 --> 01:46.564
seeking a bit of lunchtime<i> divertissement.</i>

01:46.648 --> 01:48.441
(all laughing)

01:48.525 --> 01:50.401
PHIL: Due to the inherently
poor lighting involved,

01:50.485 --> 01:53.113
we do not as yet have a reliable
description of the perpetrator.

01:53.196 --> 01:56.074
However, be apprised,

01:56.157 --> 01:58.952
two of our people will be staked out
this afternoon

01:59.035 --> 02:04.124
and may require short-notice backup
assistance from vicinity patrols.

02:04.415 --> 02:08.795
Uh, for the movie-going pleasure
of, uh, said undercovers,

02:08.878 --> 02:13.633
today's quadruple bill at the Pussycat
includes such exotic fare

02:14.134 --> 02:17.428
as, uh, Nights of Bondage.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.097
(chattering)

02:19.180 --> 02:22.058
PHIL: And the highly underrated
Coed Madness,

02:23.268 --> 02:26.020
featuring Ailota Fern and Jack Granite.

02:26.104 --> 02:27.772
Don't. Don't do it.

02:28.022 --> 02:29.858
PHIL: Okay, last item.

02:30.066 --> 02:33.194
The, uh, George Valesquez
Benefit Basketball Game

02:33.278 --> 02:38.032
to be held at the Burgard Vocational
Gymnasium tonight at seven o'clock.

02:38.116 --> 02:40.785
Featuring the Hill Street
Divisional All-Stars.

02:40.869 --> 02:43.204
(cheering)

02:43.288 --> 02:48.459
PHIL: Versus representatives from seven
of our more illustrious local youth gangs.

02:49.627 --> 02:52.881
Be apprised that in view of last
Tuesday night's armed hostilities

02:52.964 --> 02:57.177
between the Mau-Maus and Los Diablos,
and the subsequent manslaughter charge

02:57.260 --> 03:01.306
filed against one
Jackson "Tweety Bird" Childs,

03:01.848 --> 03:06.644
tensions between gangs and between gangs
and police are unexpectedly high.

03:08.104 --> 03:10.565
Uh, for those of you involved
in crowd control,

03:10.648 --> 03:15.403
Lieutenant Howard Hunter will be
conducting a joint EATers and gang leaders

03:15.486 --> 03:18.281
security conference here at 1400 hours.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.033
MAN: Oh, yeah, I'll be there.

03:20.116 --> 03:23.995
PHIL: After careful consideration
by Coach Neal Washington...

03:24.078 --> 03:26.706
-MAN: Yeah, baby.
-...and a vote by your peers...

03:27.582 --> 03:31.085
-the starting 5 for tonight's game is...
-MAN: All right.

03:32.128 --> 03:35.006
-...Hill.
-(cheering)

03:35.089 --> 03:38.551
-PHIL: Coffey.
-(cheering)

03:38.635 --> 03:41.971
-PHIL: Belker.
-(cheering)

03:42.513 --> 03:45.266
And J.D. LaRue,
currently assigned to the Motor Pool.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.477
-MAN: All right, J.D.!
-PHIL: And...

03:48.853 --> 03:50.521
Lucille Bates.

03:50.605 --> 03:53.900
-(cheering)
-MAN: No.

03:54.150 --> 03:58.947
All right, that's it. Let's roll.
And hey, let's be careful out there.

03:59.447 --> 04:00.406
I'm bettin' money on this thing,

04:00.490 --> 04:02.533
and now I have some woman
playing on the team.

04:02.825 --> 04:04.535
Don't worry about it, cowboy.
Don't worry about it, baby.

04:04.619 --> 04:05.912
-It's gonna be all right.
-I am worried about it.

04:06.287 --> 04:08.706
It came down from Chief Daniels's
Gang Intervention Unit.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.209
I don't care if it came down
from Mount Sinai, Frank.

04:11.292 --> 04:13.753
I'll be dipped in brown sauce
before I'll admit

04:13.836 --> 04:18.132
a bunch of genetically disenfranchised
warlords to one of my security briefings.

04:18.549 --> 04:20.885
The prevailing opinion,
and I tend to agree,

04:21.427 --> 04:24.430
is that as long as we have to play them,
there's much less chance of trouble

04:24.514 --> 04:26.849
if we include them
in the planning process.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.310
Frank, Division on line five.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.980
Why weren't we so enlightened
back in '61, Frank?

04:32.355 --> 04:34.857
I mean, we could have invited
Castro into the Oval Office

04:34.941 --> 04:36.859
for a consultation on the Bay of Pigs.

04:36.943 --> 04:37.860
Excuse me, Howard.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.613
-Excuse me, Howard.
-COFFEY: You ever watch Julius Erving?

04:40.697 --> 04:43.283
-Yeah.
-It's very simple, at the free throw line.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.952
Right here, one hand. Boom.

04:46.035 --> 04:48.830
-No, you--
-Judas H. Priest.

04:48.913 --> 04:53.084
I have seen sounder free-throw mechanics
from the goldarn Vietnamese.

04:53.167 --> 04:55.545
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:55.962 --> 04:57.672
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:57.755 --> 05:01.509
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:01.592 --> 05:03.344
(sirens wailing)

05:08.808 --> 05:12.729
(theme music playing)

06:09.994 --> 06:14.207
We got 40 bills with the Mau-Maus,
65 with the Shamrocks.

06:14.290 --> 06:18.169
Got a 30-buck side bet with Martinez
on the free throw percentage.

06:18.586 --> 06:21.381
I figure with you as starting guard,
we got 20 points in the basket

06:21.464 --> 06:22.799
before the scoreboard even lights up.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.551
Well, don't start counting
your winnings so soon, cowboy.

06:25.635 --> 06:28.179
You know those gang members
live and breathe basketball.

06:28.262 --> 06:31.474
Yeah, but you tell me how many of those
little junkies made MVP at city college

06:31.557 --> 06:32.392
-two years runnin'?
-Wait a minute, man.

06:32.475 --> 06:35.353
-That was 10 years ago.
-Muscle memory, my man.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.231
Which apartment did the screaming
come from, ma'am?

06:38.314 --> 06:40.566
-(woman on phone, indistinct)
-Uh-huh.

06:40.650 --> 06:43.403
All right, we'll get two of our
people on it right away. Yeah.

07:05.466 --> 07:07.218
I want him outta here!

07:07.552 --> 07:10.721
I want his butt arrested
and outta my apartment!

07:10.805 --> 07:13.266
Look like you forgettin' who pays
the freight around here, woman.

07:13.349 --> 07:14.767
Pay the freight?

07:15.101 --> 07:17.520
He hasn't paid the rent
in nearly two months now.

07:17.603 --> 07:21.858
Besides which I got the lease in my name.
It's right there in that drawer.

07:21.941 --> 07:24.318
Papers don't mean squat,
so why don't you just shut your mouth!

07:24.402 --> 07:26.154
Hey, everyone, just calm down.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.656
Aside from hittin' me in my face,

07:28.906 --> 07:32.243
he's threatened me with that gun
that he's always playing with.

07:32.326 --> 07:34.996
Lady, you just bring that tone down.

07:36.205 --> 07:37.957
CARTER:
I was just cleaning it, that's all.

07:38.791 --> 07:41.085
Ain't no law against that, Officer.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.631
Ma'am, would you mind stepping out
in the corridor with me?

07:45.715 --> 07:47.592
My partner would like a word
with your husband.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.095
We're not married.

07:54.849 --> 07:55.683
Okay, now.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.854
Uh, Mr. Reese,
you have a permit for this thing?

08:07.403 --> 08:08.321
Sit down.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.781
He's a Housing Authority cop?

08:13.743 --> 08:14.577
(sighs)

08:15.912 --> 08:19.207
Carter's a good man, deep down, Officer.

08:20.249 --> 08:25.880
He's been real good to William and me
the past few years, but he's changed.

08:27.256 --> 08:30.510
Ever since he got laid off
eight months ago, he's changed.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.512
He hasn't found anything else
in that time?

08:33.429 --> 08:34.972
-(dog barking in distance)
-(sighs)

08:36.432 --> 08:37.975
Not that he hasn't tried.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.647
Up until two weeks ago,
he was going out looking for work

08:42.730 --> 08:46.984
nearly every single day,
but there's nothing out there.

08:48.694 --> 08:53.241
Got so bad that he stopped
looking altogether.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.495
How are you getting by?

08:59.914 --> 09:00.957
We're not.

09:02.667 --> 09:06.420
Mrs. Tate,
what would you like for us to do?

09:07.463 --> 09:10.132
If you file charges,
we can take him down to the station,

09:10.216 --> 09:12.969
but I can't say
that's gonna solve anything.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.595
No, please.

09:15.596 --> 09:19.141
I don't wanna get Carter in trouble,
but I'm afraid to stay here.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.269
For me and my boy.

09:23.521 --> 09:28.025
(sighs) Is there anyplace
that you can stay for a few days,

09:28.109 --> 09:30.486
just until this thing settles down?

09:33.864 --> 09:37.201
You tried making the rounds of the various
private security agencies?

09:37.285 --> 09:39.287
I know it doesn't pay much,
but maybe it could tide you over

09:39.370 --> 09:41.038
till they have a recall or something.

09:41.289 --> 09:45.293
Why don't you save that career counseling
for your next domestic, Jack?

09:45.376 --> 09:46.419
(sighs)

09:46.752 --> 09:48.629
You don't know nothin' about my situation.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.258
City's finest. (scoffs)

09:52.925 --> 09:57.555
Yeah, you got an academy certificate
that's good for 20 years,

09:58.347 --> 10:00.850
a full pension
and all benefits guaranteed.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.685
Look, I know how you feel, man.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.312
Man, you don't know nothin'.

10:07.148 --> 10:10.443
I worked the federal projects
for eight years.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.987
I went places you dudes wouldn't go.

10:14.113 --> 10:20.286
I got shot twice, stabbed three times,
all in the line of duty. (scoffs)

10:21.329 --> 10:24.332
Yeah, the city gotta tighten their purse.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.668
It's always guys like me
that gotta go first.

10:28.044 --> 10:31.839
I came within three lousy points
of making the academy.

10:34.425 --> 10:35.843
Hey-- What's goin' on?

10:35.926 --> 10:37.637
Carter, we thought it would be better

10:37.720 --> 10:39.930
if, uh-- better for everyone

10:40.014 --> 10:42.391
if we took your lady and her
son over to a friend's house,

10:42.475 --> 10:44.268
just until things cool out.

10:46.395 --> 10:47.563
You ain't goin' nowhere!

10:48.397 --> 10:50.107
Come on, stay, baby, please.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.860
William, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, William.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.072
Don't go. Please don't.

11:05.289 --> 11:07.166
Look, if it'll help you, Mr. Reese,

11:07.249 --> 11:10.336
I-I have some people I know
down at the department that could--

11:12.838 --> 11:13.964
Just go away. (sobbing)

11:16.884 --> 11:17.718
Go...

11:25.518 --> 11:26.352
(door closes)

11:35.528 --> 11:37.530
-(doorbell rings on screen)
-(rock music playing)

11:37.613 --> 11:39.323
WOMAN (on screen):
<i>Just a minute. I'm coming.</i>

11:41.784 --> 11:42.952
-WOMAN:<i> Hello?</i>
-MAN:<i> Hi. Excuse me, ma'am.</i>

11:43.077 --> 11:45.746
MAN:<i> I'm from the Complete Suction</i>
<i>Vacuum Company.</i>

11:46.455 --> 11:48.499
<i>I wonder if I could show you</i>
<i>some of my equipment.</i>

11:49.250 --> 11:52.002
WOMAN:<i> Well, I-I'm busy</i>
<i>doing housework right now.</i>

11:52.086 --> 11:55.172
MAN:<i> Really, it won't take much time</i>
<i>at all, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.</i>

11:55.548 --> 11:59.802
WOMAN:<i> Uh, well, my husband</i>
<i>is very happy with ours.</i>

12:00.052 --> 12:01.095
MAN:<i> Oh, is that right?</i>

12:01.554 --> 12:04.223
WOMAN:<i> I suppose I could</i>
<i>use a new vacuum cleaner.</i>

12:04.306 --> 12:06.517
-(whispers)
<i>-</i>MAN:<i> I can do a demonstration for you.</i>

12:06.600 --> 12:09.603
<i>-It'll just take a little while.</i>
<i>-</i>WOMAN:<i> Okay, why don't you come in.</i>

12:09.687 --> 12:12.398
MAN:<i> All right.</i>
<i>Beautiful place you have here.</i>

12:12.481 --> 12:13.858
WOMAN:<i> Oh, thank you.</i>

12:14.316 --> 12:16.777
MAN:<i> Oh, but I see there is a little dirt</i>
<i>on the carpet.</i>

12:16.861 --> 12:17.695
WOMAN:<i> Mm-hmm.</i>

12:18.571 --> 12:21.574
MAN:<i> Let me just turn this on,</i>
<i>and I can show you how it works.</i>

12:22.199 --> 12:24.326
(vacuum whirring)

12:32.752 --> 12:34.128
I've seen this one before.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.214
-It's not that good.
-(woman laughs)

12:37.631 --> 12:40.843
-(dialog on screen continues)
-The director stretches his metaphors.

12:41.469 --> 12:42.344
Ooh.

12:43.512 --> 12:44.930
MAN:<i> It's unbuttoned a little bit there.</i>

12:45.014 --> 12:47.850
I'm only killing a little time
between appointments.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.311
MAN:<i> Take off my jacket</i>
<i>so I can get more comfortable.</i>

12:50.394 --> 12:53.773
<i>-</i>WOMAN:<i> Good. It is rather hot in here.</i>
<i>-</i>MAN:<i> It is quite hot. It is.</i>

12:53.856 --> 12:55.649
<i>-</i>MAN:<i> It's getting warmer.</i>
-Say, does, uh,

12:56.525 --> 12:58.277
all this smoke in here bother you?

12:58.360 --> 13:00.362
Move it or lose it at the elbow.

13:03.699 --> 13:06.786
WOMAN:<i> Ooh, that sounds exciting,</i>
<i>but, um, actually--</i>

13:06.869 --> 13:08.579
I could take you out to lunch.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.126
I could take you to jail, dog breath.

13:20.132 --> 13:23.010
-(conversation continues on screen)
-(clears throat)

13:23.093 --> 13:24.553
WOMAN:<i> Could I see how that one</i>
<i>works, please?</i>

13:24.637 --> 13:25.471
MAN:<i> Yes.</i>

13:33.062 --> 13:34.897
Looks like business as usual around here.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.149
Henry.

13:37.858 --> 13:39.777
I didn't think you were coming back
till Monday.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.780
Been kinda antsy sittin' around the house.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.743
-Can I talk to you for a second, Frank?
-Sure.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.793
Uh-- (sighs)

13:56.085 --> 13:59.964
Just so you know,
Rachel and I are getting a divorce.

14:00.339 --> 14:01.173
Oh.

14:02.675 --> 14:06.011
We've been at it from every angle--

14:07.137 --> 14:10.933
professional counseling,
talk of moving out of the city,

14:11.350 --> 14:12.434
career changes.

14:13.602 --> 14:16.313
Long, toneless conversations
around the kitchen table

14:16.397 --> 14:17.565
till 2:00 in the morning.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.738
Rachel laid a lot of stuff on me
about the marriage

14:24.822 --> 14:26.574
that she'd been holding in for years,
you know.

14:26.740 --> 14:29.159
How she never wanted me
to be a cop in the first place.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.747
In retrospect, I'm surprised
it didn't happen before now.

14:35.207 --> 14:36.333
How's your boy taking it?

14:38.627 --> 14:39.587
He's four years old.

14:41.171 --> 14:42.715
Doesn't know what the hell's going on.

14:44.216 --> 14:45.801
He's, uh, confused.

14:46.719 --> 14:47.553
He's angry.

14:52.099 --> 14:52.933
Scared.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.852
HENRY: How do I tell him I am, too?

14:56.520 --> 14:57.563
Just like that.

15:01.650 --> 15:04.028
How did Frank Jr. take it
when you and Fay split up?

15:04.528 --> 15:06.697
Hard. He thought it was all his fault.

15:09.533 --> 15:11.118
He had the feeling that if he could

15:12.161 --> 15:16.540
somehow become this perfect kid,
maybe he could get us back together.

15:17.207 --> 15:19.877
When he found out he couldn't,
he had some serious problems.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.004
And now?

15:22.087 --> 15:24.798
Now he knows my problems with Fay
had nothing to do with him,

15:24.882 --> 15:26.216
that I love him very much.

15:28.469 --> 15:31.513
But I won't kid you, Henry,
there's still a lot of pain for all of us.

15:31.597 --> 15:34.183
I don't like being a weekend father.
You're not gonna like it, either.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.979
I just can't keep going through
the motions, Frank.

15:39.063 --> 15:42.650
I mean, last week, lying in a hospital,

15:42.733 --> 15:45.194
all I could think about
was how lucky I was to be alive.

15:47.446 --> 15:48.405
And I'm finding it

15:50.240 --> 15:51.742
pretty hard to imagine

15:53.702 --> 15:56.038
not waking up Josh
for school in the morning.

15:58.832 --> 15:59.708
I just know I--

16:01.794 --> 16:03.712
I have to move forward.

16:09.760 --> 16:13.389
FURILLO: I'm as aware as you people,
given current events,

16:13.973 --> 16:16.517
that the timing of this game
may not be perfect.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.434
(scoffing)

16:17.518 --> 16:19.311
But it's been agreed upon,

16:19.395 --> 16:22.189
-and we expect to proceed...
-BATES: Watch it.

16:22.272 --> 16:24.733
with the full expectation
that as a community,

16:24.817 --> 16:26.944
we can sit down
and organize something positive.

16:27.027 --> 16:30.990
In that spirit, I can only warn you.
Do not--

16:31.073 --> 16:32.616
(chattering)

16:32.700 --> 16:34.952
Disappoint our expectations.

16:35.411 --> 16:37.788
Lieutenant Hunter here
will brief you on security.

16:38.163 --> 16:41.417
-Security. (chuckles)
-(chattering)

16:41.500 --> 16:44.003
HUNTER: Now, what the captain
is suggesting, gentlemen,

16:44.086 --> 16:49.258
is that in all confrontations between
developed and undeveloped nations,

16:49.842 --> 16:55.264
you may enjoy a numerical superiority,

16:55.514 --> 16:59.268
but we will enjoy
a superiority in firepower.

16:59.351 --> 17:02.771
(laughter)

17:03.188 --> 17:06.442
Yo, Howie, I get the distinct impression

17:06.525 --> 17:10.320
you're implying gang disruption
of this illustrious affair.

17:10.404 --> 17:13.574
Well, what I am implying, Mr. Martinez,

17:13.657 --> 17:16.410
is that, uh, as Mao Tse-tung
once observed,

17:16.493 --> 17:20.456
power grows out of the end of a gun,
and you'll be leaving yours at home.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.125
-(chattering)
-HUNTER: Now, all persons--

17:23.208 --> 17:26.503
Listen to me, gentlemen,
all persons entering that gym

17:26.587 --> 17:29.339
will be stopped and frisked at the door.

17:29.423 --> 17:30.299
No exceptions.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.676
-(chattering)
-HUNTER: And anyone found

17:32.760 --> 17:36.180
in illegal possession of a firearm
will be put into custody

17:36.263 --> 17:38.807
and delivered to this station
for incarceration.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.477
-I'm not coming here without my piece.
-HUNTER: Gentlemen.

17:41.560 --> 17:45.689
This game will be a model
of civilized behavior.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.941
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, my man.

17:48.150 --> 17:51.236
Now, maybe you got all these
other bacteria brains fooled,

17:51.320 --> 17:52.780
but not Cookie Marcel.

17:53.238 --> 17:58.035
Now, you get a security force
inside that gym, the Dragons get one too.

17:58.118 --> 18:01.038
-MAN: That's right.
-Who you calling bacteria brain, fool?

18:01.789 --> 18:03.999
-MAN: Ooh.
-Well, you answered to your name.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.834
-So it must be plain.
-MAN: Oh, no.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.544
MAN 2: There's trouble in the monkey cage.

18:07.628 --> 18:12.257
(overlapping yelling)

18:12.341 --> 18:14.051
-Change your face, fool!
-MAN: Trouble in the monkey cage.

18:14.134 --> 18:15.928
-I'm cool. (chuckles)
-Come on, Cookie.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.014
-Hey, hey, get off my man, man.
-Sit down.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.015
What's your problem?

18:21.600 --> 18:22.518
Yes, ma'am.

18:22.601 --> 18:23.644
MAN 3: Hey, wait a minute, hey.

18:23.727 --> 18:27.064
I want a Gypsy boy
for every cop in that gym.

18:27.147 --> 18:29.191
-(all agreeing)
-MAN 4: We want one too, man.

18:29.274 --> 18:32.152
Oh, and I want some of them
yellow armbands too.

18:32.236 --> 18:36.406
-(all agreeing)
-You watch us, we watch you.

18:36.490 --> 18:39.201
Uh, gentlemen, security
has been well provided for.

18:39.284 --> 18:40.953
-The request is denied.
-(men complaining)

18:41.036 --> 18:43.622
What are we doing here then?
What are we doing here?

18:43.705 --> 18:46.041
Excuse me. Excuse me, handsome.

18:46.792 --> 18:50.379
Uh, I'd like to talk about
diplomatic immunity, huh?

18:50.462 --> 18:53.048
(all agreeing)

18:53.132 --> 18:54.925
Diplomatic immunity?

18:55.175 --> 18:58.303
Judas, Frank, are we expected
to eat this "bushwash"

18:58.387 --> 19:01.473
from a bunch of genetically deviated
miscreants?

19:01.557 --> 19:03.517
(all yelling)

19:11.108 --> 19:14.528
Furillo, get rid of this guy, will ya?

19:14.611 --> 19:17.573
(all agreeing)

19:17.656 --> 19:21.618
-No immunity, no game. Good night.
-(men agreeing)

19:21.702 --> 19:25.247
-I like that man.
-No immunity, no game.

19:25.330 --> 19:28.959
(indistinct whispering)

19:29.042 --> 19:29.877
Gentlemen.

19:31.295 --> 19:34.756
Gentlemen, uh,
the captain has asked me to inform you

19:34.840 --> 19:40.053
that there will, indeed, be diplomatic
immunity on all outstanding warrants.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.471
-All right. Yeah.
-HUNTER: However--

19:41.555 --> 19:44.308
However, there will be
no transactional immunity.

19:44.391 --> 19:48.604
I.E.: You are liable for any crimes
committed on the premises.

19:48.687 --> 19:51.732
That is final and non-negotiable.

19:51.940 --> 19:54.109
-MAN: Oh, yeah, we're negotiating.
-You're liable too, Junior.

19:54.193 --> 19:57.905
All right, gentlemen,
are there any other questions?

19:57.988 --> 19:59.031
Yeah, I got a question.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.867
Yeah, are you some kind
of a queen, or what?

20:01.950 --> 20:04.995
(laughter)

20:05.078 --> 20:05.954
MAN: Jerk.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.750
See you on the court, Howie.

20:17.424 --> 20:21.053
Frank, it's gonna be a regular Appalachian
crime convention in that gym.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.513
Now, just give me the okay.

20:23.972 --> 20:27.184
I'll ring it with a beefed up EATer
division, and we'll drop the net.

20:27.476 --> 20:30.979
It's our chance to set urban crime
back a generation.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.564
Howard, it's a charitable event.

20:33.607 --> 20:34.942
It very well could be, Frank.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.946
Look at what those spaghetti-bending
leathernecks did with the Red Brigades

20:39.029 --> 20:40.530
after the Dozier release.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.282
I could move like that.

20:43.116 --> 20:45.410
I'll consider it, Howard, later...

20:46.370 --> 20:47.496
in the war room.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.718
I wanna go home.

21:01.802 --> 21:04.221
No, sir. You stay in this hospital.
You're gonna get well sooner.

21:04.304 --> 21:06.348
Besides, me and Tracy want you to.
Right, Trace?

21:06.431 --> 21:09.059
I think if Dad wants to go home,
he should go home.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.561
Besides, you got all the modern
conveniences here.

21:11.645 --> 21:13.897
You got a television set.
Just push a button, it goes on and off.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.316
You got another button, you push it,
pretty little nurse comes running in--

21:16.400 --> 21:18.860
Damn it to hell!

21:18.944 --> 21:22.572
-Daddy-- Daddy, please, don't.
-I'm just a piece of meat in this place.

21:22.906 --> 21:26.076
They roll me from room to room,
stick needles in me.

21:26.159 --> 21:27.244
I'm a piece of meat.

21:27.327 --> 21:29.913
-Daddy, they're just trying to help you.
-They're trying to kill me.

21:29.997 --> 21:32.082
No, no, Daddy,
they're not trying to kill you.

21:34.418 --> 21:37.170
I just wanna get outta here.

21:44.344 --> 21:46.722
WOMAN (on P.A.):<i> ICU, third floor...</i>

21:46.805 --> 21:48.098
Thanks a lot for backing me up.

21:48.181 --> 21:50.309
You're doing him a hell
of a lot of good, you know.

21:50.892 --> 21:54.313
Look, the doctors tell me everything
they tell you, Andy.

21:54.604 --> 21:57.566
He's got six weeks.
Everyone knows it but him.

21:57.774 --> 22:00.152
It isn't right.
If he wants to go home, he should go home.

22:00.235 --> 22:03.322
You don't get radiation
and chemotherapy at home.

22:03.405 --> 22:04.531
Things are different, damn it.

22:04.614 --> 22:06.408
He can walk away from this,
and you know it.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.201
It's in his bones, Andy.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.704
It's probably in his liver
and his kidneys by now.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.372
-Let him go home.
-No.

22:12.456 --> 22:15.334
-Hey, Andy.
-Hey, man, where you been?

22:15.417 --> 22:17.044
-Are you crazy?
-I had trouble with my bike.

22:17.127 --> 22:18.128
Andy, leave him alone.

22:18.211 --> 22:21.048
-Your father is up there sick.
-Andy, just stop it.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.551
It's not his fault.
We're just at each other's throats.

22:24.634 --> 22:28.138
You gotta stop it, or we're gonna kill
what's little left of this family.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.225
So, cowboy, why don't you
let me take the wheel?

22:32.309 --> 22:33.352
You can grab a bite to eat.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.354
What's the matter,
don't I drive good enough for you?

22:35.437 --> 22:37.064
No, that's not it. I just thought maybe--

22:37.147 --> 22:40.484
Just give me a few more miles, man.
Just give me a few more miles.

22:40.609 --> 22:43.403
WOMAN (on radio):<i> All units in</i>
<i>the vicinity of 25 Linwood Terrace,</i>

22:43.487 --> 22:45.655
<i>we have a 211, possible assault.</i>

22:45.739 --> 22:49.034
<i>-Man with a gun. Respond, any units.</i>
-Lin-- Linwood Terrace.

22:49.117 --> 22:51.411
Isn't that where we dropped off that woman
and that little boy this morning?

22:51.495 --> 22:54.164
-Yeah, damn. Hit it, Renko.
-(siren wailing)

23:06.593 --> 23:09.054
(police radio chatter)

23:11.640 --> 23:13.892
He's got Sheila!
He's got Sheila and he's got a gun!

23:13.975 --> 23:14.851
They in the apartment?

23:14.935 --> 23:17.062
Yes, he locked me out,
he wouldn't let me in.

23:17.145 --> 23:17.979
He's gonna kill them both.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.398
For God's sake, somebody help me!

23:19.481 --> 23:21.775
CARTER: Get in here! All right.

23:21.858 --> 23:23.235
-Now you all try coming up here.
-Get back!

23:23.318 --> 23:26.488
Come on up here, they dead, you hear me?
I'm gonna kill 'em. You hear me?

23:26.571 --> 23:27.823
Come on up and find out!

23:29.241 --> 23:30.742
The perimeter's secure, Frank.

23:30.826 --> 23:33.036
The buildings in the line
of fire are being evacuated,

23:33.120 --> 23:35.872
and my men are deploying as per policy.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.791
Good work, Howard. Henry there?

23:37.874 --> 23:41.962
<i>Stay away from the windows.</i>
<i>I repeat, stay away from the windows.</i>

23:42.629 --> 23:45.257
MAN (on P.A.):<i> Stand back.</i>
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please stand back.</i>

23:45.632 --> 23:47.175
He's just arriving now, Frank.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.553
Okay. Keep me very posted.

23:49.636 --> 23:50.470
I read.

23:53.056 --> 23:54.558
He ain't answering his phone, Henry.

23:54.641 --> 23:57.018
He's pretty agitated, Henry.
Probably drinkin'.

23:57.352 --> 23:59.813
-How long's it been ringing?
-About four minutes.

24:00.814 --> 24:02.983
You ever listen to a phone
ring continuously?

24:04.317 --> 24:06.653
-Bullhorn.
-MAN:<i> Folks, if you'll just step back.</i>

24:06.945 --> 24:09.114
<i>Everybody, please move back.</i>

24:12.451 --> 24:15.245
<i>Carter. Carter Reese.</i>

24:16.788 --> 24:18.874
<i>My name's Detective Sergeant</i>
<i>Henry Goldblume.</i>

24:18.957 --> 24:20.500
<i>I'm from the Hill Street Precinct.</i>

24:21.460 --> 24:23.462
<i>It's very important that I talk with you.</i>

24:24.337 --> 24:25.630
Renko, try the number again.

24:27.215 --> 24:28.383
<i>I'm gonna call you on the phone.</i>

24:28.467 --> 24:30.719
<i>-I'm only gonna let it ring five times.</i>
-Police 6, this is 2202 Renko.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.762
HENRY (over bullhorn):
<i>I want you to pick it up, please.</i>

24:38.685 --> 24:41.271
(phone ringing)

24:42.981 --> 24:46.193
(police radio chatter)

24:50.739 --> 24:52.991
(ringing continues)

24:58.830 --> 25:02.626
Mr. Reese? Mr. Reese, I wanna help you.

25:03.293 --> 25:05.253
HENRY (over phone):<i> I've just finished</i>
<i>talking with James Peterson,</i>

25:05.337 --> 25:06.546
<i>your commanding officer.</i>

25:06.630 --> 25:08.006
<i>He was very sympathetic.</i>

25:08.089 --> 25:11.134
He said he'd do anything in his power
to get you your job back.

25:12.427 --> 25:13.720
You're too late, man.

25:15.639 --> 25:16.640
It's too late.

25:17.807 --> 25:18.850
Too late? What do you mean?

25:19.309 --> 25:21.895
About jobs and all, you know.

25:23.480 --> 25:24.856
I'm over the line, man.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.317
I crossed it.

25:27.692 --> 25:29.277
Carter, you're wrong.

25:30.111 --> 25:33.073
CARTER: You expect me to believe
they're gonna give anything to a man

25:33.156 --> 25:34.866
who say he's gonna kill his old lady?

25:35.659 --> 25:37.786
Hmm? (chuckles)

25:39.829 --> 25:40.997
It's too late, man.

25:42.624 --> 25:43.708
I'm over the line.

25:43.792 --> 25:47.254
Carter, I know you think you're in
big trouble, but it just isn't so.

25:47.337 --> 25:51.007
No one's been hurt.
At this point, we can work anything out.

25:51.091 --> 25:52.968
Mm, yeah.

25:54.177 --> 25:55.637
What are we gonna work out, man?

25:56.888 --> 25:57.722
Hmm?

25:59.057 --> 26:01.560
Ain't nothin' to work out, man.

26:01.643 --> 26:04.688
I tried. I tried it their way,

26:04.771 --> 26:07.816
and it all falls apart, anyway.

26:13.905 --> 26:14.990
It's too late, man.

26:16.533 --> 26:20.120
This time I'm takin' it to the end.

26:21.121 --> 26:23.373
Carter, let me have the child.

26:23.790 --> 26:25.959
Put him in front of the door.
Let the adults work this out.

26:27.335 --> 26:28.336
I'm just goin' now.

26:29.588 --> 26:33.425
You know, just ridin' with it.

26:36.136 --> 26:39.389
-(hangs up, dial tone)
-Carter?

26:47.397 --> 26:49.608
Francis, Henry on line two.

26:49.691 --> 26:50.525
Thanks, Phil.

26:51.484 --> 26:52.319
Yeah, Henry.

26:52.402 --> 26:55.530
It's a bad situation here, Frank.
I've lost the guy. He won't respond to me.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.824
I got a terrible feeling
he's gonna hurt somebody.

26:57.907 --> 27:00.201
Uh, you wanna kick the door?

27:02.245 --> 27:07.334
Uh, to be honest, I don't want
the responsibility for that one.

27:08.251 --> 27:10.045
It's not just the woman.
He's got a six-year-old kid.

27:10.420 --> 27:13.923
What do you think, Howard?
Can you sharpshoot him through the window?

27:15.634 --> 27:18.053
I think I'll go along with Henry,
it may be...

27:18.386 --> 27:21.598
It may be a little premature, Frank.
Not with that boy in there.

27:21.973 --> 27:24.476
All right.
Uh, just try to get him back on the line.

27:24.559 --> 27:25.560
I'm on my way.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.401
MAN IN MOVIE:<i> Yes, how may I serve you?</i>

27:34.277 --> 27:38.823
MAN 2 IN MOVIE:<i> Uh, how do you do?</i>
<i>I'm from the vacuum cleaner company,</i>

27:38.907 --> 27:41.034
<i>and I'd like to show you</i>
<i>some of my equipment.</i>

27:41.117 --> 27:43.495
<i>Would you like to speak</i>
<i>to the lady of the house?</i>

27:45.830 --> 27:46.873
(sighs)

27:48.625 --> 27:49.459
What'll you have?

27:50.960 --> 27:53.630
<i>(movie dialog continues)</i>

27:53.713 --> 27:57.676
Uh, I'll have one of these chocolate bars,
please.

27:58.843 --> 28:01.596
And, uh, a bag of roasted peanuts.

28:02.472 --> 28:06.726
And a package of these cookies right here
and a large bag of mints, please.

28:07.644 --> 28:09.521
And a large popcorn with double butter.

28:14.359 --> 28:15.944
Oh, and a diet soda.

28:21.366 --> 28:23.952
I don't mean any offense by this,
ma'am, but I gotta tell you,

28:24.035 --> 28:25.161
after three hours in there,

28:25.245 --> 28:27.664
it's a real pleasure to see someone
with their clothes on.

28:27.747 --> 28:29.290
Four-ninety-five, please.

28:30.208 --> 28:31.334
I know what you must be thinkin'.

28:31.418 --> 28:33.628
Any guy that comes into
a sleaze joint like this

28:33.712 --> 28:35.839
has gotta be a real dirtbag, right?

28:36.589 --> 28:39.259
The fact is, these kind of movies
make me want to puke.

28:40.385 --> 28:43.138
I mean, I know it seems funny and all,
my being in here half the day,

28:43.221 --> 28:46.808
but, um, I had a client cancel out on me.

28:46.891 --> 28:50.019
-You know, I got a lot of time to kill.
-Yeah, I know what you mean.

28:50.103 --> 28:51.229
The gentleman here before you said

28:51.312 --> 28:53.982
he was with a team of South American
anthropologists,

28:54.482 --> 28:56.651
studying North American mating rituals.

28:56.735 --> 28:57.569
No kidding?

29:12.125 --> 29:14.919
Nice and easy, slim. Nobody gets hurt.

29:15.253 --> 29:18.173
-Sounds right to me, my man.
-Okay now, where's your money?

29:18.590 --> 29:22.010
-Right front pants pocket.
-Don't even blink fast.

29:22.594 --> 29:23.428
You got it.

29:30.059 --> 29:32.687
(Washington yells in agony, straining)

29:34.147 --> 29:35.190
(glass shattering)

29:43.281 --> 29:45.742
(growls, yells)

29:52.999 --> 29:55.794
You suck bilgewater, dog breath!

30:00.256 --> 30:02.550
-Get him outta my sight.
-Get me medical attention.

30:02.634 --> 30:05.512
-That animal tried to maul me.
-(growls)

30:09.599 --> 30:11.893
Hey, are you all right?

30:12.477 --> 30:13.686
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

30:14.479 --> 30:17.273
-I had no idea you were a cop.
-(chuckles)

30:17.607 --> 30:18.775
You weren't supposed to.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.027
You were magnificent.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.114
Thank you very much.

30:26.074 --> 30:29.953
You know, I only work here because
I was laid off from the phone company.

30:30.870 --> 30:33.623
-Jobs are so scarce.
-I know. They really are.

30:36.167 --> 30:38.837
You think you might be needing me
as a witness or something?

30:39.128 --> 30:40.088
Well, I don't know.

30:42.048 --> 30:45.426
Uh, maybe we might--
We're probably gonna need you.

30:45.510 --> 30:48.513
Let me give you my card, and, uh--

30:51.474 --> 30:55.687
If you wanna give me a call sometime,
uh, maybe we could get together.

30:56.062 --> 31:00.066
-Just to talk about the case.
-Yeah, I'd like that very much.

31:00.441 --> 31:01.568
Well, good. Thank you.

31:13.413 --> 31:14.247
Anything?

31:14.497 --> 31:15.999
We've been calling,
but he hasn't picked up.

31:16.082 --> 31:17.250
Any chance he's passed out?

31:17.667 --> 31:19.627
No, these types are so hyper,
they burn it off.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.504
Booze only makes them more unpredictable.

31:21.588 --> 31:23.715
How long would it take you
to get in there, Howard?

31:23.798 --> 31:24.632
Four seconds.

31:24.966 --> 31:27.135
-All right, get back on the phone again.
-Right.

31:27.218 --> 31:28.761
(phone ringing)

31:29.387 --> 31:33.349
-(humming)
-(ringing continues)

31:43.401 --> 31:46.571
Man, if you call here one more time,

31:46.654 --> 31:48.740
I'm gonna take this phone
and I'm gonna throw it out the window.

31:48.823 --> 31:51.034
Carter, it's Henry Goldblume.

31:51.409 --> 31:53.244
I don't wanna talk to you, man.

31:53.328 --> 31:55.371
Carter, I-I just thought
you might be hungry.

31:55.788 --> 31:58.666
Let me get some of the guys
to rustle you up a couple of burgers.

31:59.417 --> 32:01.669
The child must be hungry too.
We can put 'em out in front of the door.

32:02.128 --> 32:05.590
Yeah, yeah, I got a stomachache.

32:06.382 --> 32:08.134
Yeah, it hurts a whole lot.

32:08.217 --> 32:12.180
You know, the food will take care of that.
Anything else we can get you, Carter?

32:13.806 --> 32:14.807
HENRY (over phone):<i> Carter?</i>

32:16.601 --> 32:17.518
<i>Carter Reese?</i>

32:20.188 --> 32:22.941
-(Carter humming)
-(sobbing)

32:30.573 --> 32:32.909
He sounds tired, Frank. Exhausted.

32:34.243 --> 32:36.120
But if we can get him to eat,
it's a good sign.

32:36.329 --> 32:38.122
Maybe I can put a note in with the food.

32:38.414 --> 32:39.874
-He'll have a number to call in case--
-(gunshot)

32:40.750 --> 32:42.627
-Oh, my God.
-Kick it in, Howard.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.797
-(gunshots continue)
-Go! Go! Kick it!

32:47.548 --> 32:49.634
-Oh, God!
-Everybody out!

32:50.051 --> 32:52.679
-Oh, God!
-Is the woman still alive?

32:53.930 --> 32:57.016
All right, get a unit for this one!
Just get a unit for this one!

32:57.350 --> 32:58.643
MAN: All right, we need a paramedic
up here right away.

32:58.726 --> 33:00.061
RENKO: I'm sorry, man.
I can't deal with this now.

33:00.144 --> 33:03.356
You take it over.
I'll call it in from downstairs.

33:03.439 --> 33:04.691
I gotta get outta here.

33:05.149 --> 33:08.277
-MAN: Yeah, personnel's all safe.
-Hi, William, remember me?

33:08.695 --> 33:11.739
(chattering continues)

33:11.823 --> 33:13.491
Everything's gonna be all right, son.

33:18.705 --> 33:20.373
I want you to come to me, William.

33:22.000 --> 33:22.834
Okay?

33:25.086 --> 33:26.045
Come on, champ.

33:31.592 --> 33:32.427
Attaboy.

33:35.471 --> 33:36.305
Please, William.

33:41.686 --> 33:42.520
Come on.

33:46.274 --> 33:47.608
Yeah, yeah.

34:20.850 --> 34:24.812
(rolling thunder)

34:24.896 --> 34:27.315
-HILL: You hear the siren? Wah, wah, wah.
-WILLIAM: Yeah.

34:27.398 --> 34:30.026
HILL: Let's turn this corner. Here we go.

34:30.109 --> 34:31.861
-HILL: Policemen drive fast, don't they?
-WILLIAM: Yeah.

34:31.944 --> 34:33.780
-HILL (laughs): Do you like that?
-WILLIAM: Yeah.

34:33.863 --> 34:36.282
Oh, that's good.
Here we go. Turn this corner.

34:36.365 --> 34:38.785
(makes squealing sound)

34:38.868 --> 34:42.121
HENRY: Officer Hill, Ms. Morgenstern
of the Youth Authority.

34:42.205 --> 34:44.415
-Her assistant, Mr. Freeman.
-Hi, ma'am.

34:51.339 --> 34:52.340
Hello, William.

34:54.133 --> 34:56.135
You know your mama is sick,

34:57.136 --> 34:58.971
and she has to stay at the hospital.

35:00.431 --> 35:03.059
So she's asked us to take care of you
till she gets out.

35:03.559 --> 35:05.144
Now, your mama's gonna be okay.

35:06.687 --> 35:09.107
As soon as we can,
we'll go visit her, all right?

35:09.190 --> 35:13.277
-You wanna come with us now in our car?
-It's okay, William.

35:15.696 --> 35:16.823
I'll bet you're hungry.

35:18.491 --> 35:22.954
We've got some, uh, fudge cookies?
Fudge cookies, huh?

35:23.663 --> 35:25.957
Mm, sounds good to me.
What about you, champ?

35:29.544 --> 35:30.920
Uh, Officer Hill,

35:33.005 --> 35:38.177
I hope it's not too imposing to ask,
but he seems terribly attached to you.

35:39.095 --> 35:44.225
If you could come with us for even
a half hour or an hour, it'd really help.

35:46.978 --> 35:47.812
Sure.

35:49.230 --> 35:51.983
Wanna go for a ride, champ?
Let's go for a ride.

35:54.569 --> 35:55.403
There we go.

35:57.780 --> 35:59.657
Let's go get some of those fudge cookies.

36:01.576 --> 36:03.661
(rolling thunder)

36:10.960 --> 36:12.211
(phone ringing)

36:17.049 --> 36:18.843
Oh, Francis-- Thank you very much.

36:18.926 --> 36:21.596
Uh, I just spoke to the hospital.

36:21.679 --> 36:24.265
The mother's out of surgery.
Her condition's stable.

36:24.348 --> 36:26.475
Oh, good. Thanks, Phil.

36:36.736 --> 36:39.780
BATES: But I'm not worried.
I know we got this game in the bag.

36:40.156 --> 36:41.282
(groans)

36:44.160 --> 36:49.916
What I wanna know is how the bookies down
on Utica have us as 11-point underdogs.

36:49.999 --> 36:52.835
Because they don't know
about our secret weapon, dummy.

36:53.586 --> 36:55.129
-J.D.: Hey, guys.
-Hi, J.D.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.505
-All right. All right.
-Hi, J.D.

36:56.589 --> 36:58.466
Look, are we ready to go out
and kick the tails off

36:58.549 --> 36:59.842
of those little twerps, or what?

37:00.760 --> 37:02.970
-MAN: You got it. Of course.
-Sarge.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.014
-Hi, J.D.
-Hey, J.D.

37:05.765 --> 37:08.059
-Man, hey, something happened to your eye.
-COFFEY: Think quick.

37:08.142 --> 37:10.686
NEAL: I'll tell you about it later.
How are you doin'?

37:10.770 --> 37:14.899
Uh, Neal,
thanks for throwing my hat in the ring.

37:14.982 --> 37:16.567
I appreciate it. I really do.

37:18.236 --> 37:21.364
-I don't belong here anymore, man.
-Hey, you're playing, babe.

37:22.073 --> 37:22.907
We need you.

37:23.908 --> 37:26.577
Be apprised, that not withstanding
all considerations,

37:26.661 --> 37:29.830
both monetary and,
uh,<i> esprit de corps</i>-wise,

37:29.914 --> 37:35.044
this game will be officiated
with scrupulous impartiality.

37:35.127 --> 37:36.212
MAN: We wouldn't want it
any other way, Sarge.

37:36.295 --> 37:37.129
Captain.

37:38.631 --> 37:39.465
J.D.

37:42.760 --> 37:45.012
Ah, gentlemen, and lady.

37:47.014 --> 37:49.392
I know how badly
you all want to win this one,

37:49.475 --> 37:51.102
but let's keep our perspective, shall we?

37:52.728 --> 37:54.146
I mean, the final score
isn't gonna mean much

37:54.230 --> 37:56.399
if the whole thing ends up
in a full-blown riot.

37:56.983 --> 38:00.444
Given our current relationships
with the, uh-- with the gangs,

38:00.528 --> 38:02.530
there's liable to be a lot of hostility
out there on the court.

38:02.613 --> 38:05.324
So let's exercise appropriate restraint.

38:05.700 --> 38:07.618
Let's keep it cool
and let's keep it clean.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.167
(whistle blows)

38:16.335 --> 38:20.214
(whistle blows)

38:23.926 --> 38:26.679
Personal foul. Two shots, biting!

38:29.307 --> 38:31.183
Foul on number 11, biting!

38:31.267 --> 38:33.936
ANNOUNCER:<i> Personal foul,</i>
<i>number 11-- biting.</i>

38:35.438 --> 38:37.356
<i>Sharron at the free throw line.</i>

38:38.899 --> 38:40.192
(cheerleaders) Hey, hey, what do ya say?

38:41.360 --> 38:44.322
Two shots.
Hold your position on the first.

38:44.989 --> 38:50.119
-Whoo!
-(jeering)

38:59.420 --> 39:02.840
Some team.
I busted this clown for ludes a month ago.

39:02.923 --> 39:04.342
Looks like he's still high on them.

39:04.425 --> 39:06.385
REFEREE: One coming. Play the miss.

39:08.220 --> 39:12.433
(crowd cheering)

39:16.103 --> 39:20.149
(chanting, clapping)

39:24.111 --> 39:28.449
ANNOUNCER:<i> Now playing for the All-Stars,</i>
<i>Carl "the Pearl" Burlington.</i>

39:28.824 --> 39:30.368
That's the 11-point spread.

39:30.659 --> 39:33.204

Well, Tommy stay for a while?

Now, look here, Daddy.

46:26.617 --> 46:28.952
I really think you can beat this thing
'cause you're a fighter.

46:29.578 --> 46:31.246
Now, in the last 10 years,
they've made a lot of strides

46:31.330 --> 46:33.123
in this chemotherapy and all that stuff.

46:34.041 --> 46:35.876
And the doctor's got a whole plan for you.

Some of these doctors
are real good people, Pop.

46:39.713 --> 46:41.632
Is that all you come back for?

46:43.217 --> 46:45.010
Daddy, if you go home, you're gonna die.

46:45.886 --> 46:47.763
I'm gonna die, anyway.

46:48.972 --> 46:51.517
No, you're not.
I don't believe that, I don't.

46:57.189 --> 46:58.106
Now, you look at me.

47:00.609 --> 47:02.569
These doctors can do something for you.

47:03.529 --> 47:04.738
Besides that, we need you.

47:05.697 --> 47:07.616
(scoffs) Grow up, will you?

47:08.242 --> 47:10.452
Don't you care enough
to do something about this?

47:11.286 --> 47:12.955
Damn it, you owe me more than this!

47:13.330 --> 47:16.083
I don't owe you nothin'.

47:17.417 --> 47:22.005
I just wanna die like I wanna die.

47:29.721 --> 47:32.933
I never asked you for nothin' before.

47:35.435 --> 47:36.645
You can hate me

47:37.896 --> 47:41.233
for being selfish and not giving a damn.

47:45.445 --> 47:47.364
But this one thing--

47:51.326 --> 47:54.162
I'm asking you now, Andrew.

48:02.421 --> 48:05.632
I'll talk to the doctors tomorrow,
and I'll see if I can bring you home.

48:36.747 --> 48:37.789
Good night, Daddy.
