14:28.135 --> 14:29.937
- YES.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.939
- SEE, IT AIN'T ME
HE'S SCARED OF.

14:31.939 --> 14:35.943
HE'S AFRAID I'LL MAKE HIM SEE
HIS OWN TRUE SELF.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.979
- WOULD YOU REVEAL HIM
IF YOU COULD?

14:39.012 --> 14:41.614
- YOU FINALLY STARTIN' TO SEE
HE'S A FAKE?

14:45.652 --> 14:47.054
- NO.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.555
I CAN'T HOLD THAT NOTION.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.223
- EXCUSE ME.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.092
- YOU'LL BE SHOT,
YOU TRY TO LEAVE.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.994
- NO, I WON'T...

14:54.027 --> 14:57.064
'CAUSE I'M TAKIN' NAOMI
AND LITTLE WILLIAM WITH ME.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.465
YOU STOOD BY ONCE ALREADY

14:58.498 --> 15:01.268
AND WATCHED
ONE OF YOUR CHILDREN DIE.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.103
YOU GONNA LET
THAT HAPPEN AGAIN?

15:03.136 --> 15:06.006
COME ON.
[clicks tongue]

15:54.054 --> 15:56.556
- DON'T TOUCH THAT.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.208
THOSE HORSES YOU LET LOOSE

16:15.242 --> 16:20.147
COST THE RAILROAD $300.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.282
REVEREND RUTH WILL BE IN DEBT
FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE

16:22.315 --> 16:26.053
TO PAY FOR WHAT YOU DID.

16:28.055 --> 16:30.290
LUCKILY...

16:30.323 --> 16:33.226
YOU WON'T BE HERE
TO SEE IT.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.231
THAT IS A FREE RAIL PASS

16:38.265 --> 16:40.067
TO THE ORPHANAGE
IN COUNCIL BLUFFS.

16:40.100 --> 16:43.136
PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET.

16:46.406 --> 16:50.110
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY WILL DO TO YOU THERE?

16:54.347 --> 16:56.316
THEY WILL GIVE YOU
A LITTLE BREAD,

16:56.349 --> 16:58.351
AND THEN
THEY WILL BEAT YOU.

17:00.787 --> 17:03.090
THEN THEY WILL GIVE YOU
SOME MORE BREAD,

17:03.090 --> 17:06.226
AND THEY WILL BEAT YOU AGAIN.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.395
I KNOW.

17:08.428 --> 17:11.231
I GREW UP
IN AN ORPHANAGE MYSELF.

17:11.264 --> 17:13.766
ENJOY YOUR TRIP.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.535
- MR. DURANT?

17:18.238 --> 17:19.206
[knock knock]

17:19.239 --> 17:22.109
MR. DURANT...

17:22.142 --> 17:24.544
I'M SO VERY SORRY.

17:30.450 --> 17:33.253
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
WITH HIM.

17:33.286 --> 17:35.722
- TAKE HIM HOME,

17:35.755 --> 17:38.791
LOVE HIM...

17:38.825 --> 17:41.194
AND KEEP HIM
OUT OF MY STOCKYARDS!

17:41.228 --> 17:43.196
- YES, MR. DURANT.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.765
I WILL.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.467
THANK YOU.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.438
[door closes]

18:01.248 --> 18:04.584
- GENTLEMEN,
HERE'S HOW I SEE IT.

18:04.617 --> 18:08.155
STATE TREASURY WILL DISPLACE
THE CASINO.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.656
- NICE IRONY.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.824
- A CULTURE'S
LARGEST BUILDING

18:11.858 --> 18:13.760
REFLECTS
WHAT IT VALUES MOST.

18:13.793 --> 18:18.265
GREEKS BUILT LIBRARIES.
ROMANS BUILT THE COLOSSEUM.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.300
NOW, THE STATE CAPITOL...

18:20.333 --> 18:22.335
- A NICE SPOT
ON THAT RISE--

18:22.369 --> 18:25.238
WELL-DRAINED,
ABOVE THE...CLUTTER.

18:25.272 --> 18:29.176
- THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL SPOT.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.478
COURTHOUSE AND JAIL

18:31.511 --> 18:34.281
SHOULD BE ACROSS
FROM THE RAILROAD OFFICES.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.849
- TESTAMENT TO LAW AND ORDER
FOR ANY NEW ARRIVAL.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.451
- YES, INDEED.

18:38.485 --> 18:42.489
SECOND ONLY IN SIZE
TO THE CAPITOL.

18:42.522 --> 18:45.858
[loud thud,
indistinct shouting]

18:49.529 --> 18:52.199
MEANTIME, BEGIN POLICING
THE STREETS.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.201
- PUBLIC SHOW OF OUR WILL?

18:54.234 --> 18:57.204
- FINDING CRIMINALS IN THIS TOWN
IS AN EASY TASK.

18:57.237 --> 19:00.873
- FIND THE RIGHT ONE...

19:03.276 --> 19:05.945
A GUILTY ONE.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.348
GOOD DAY, GENTLEMEN.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.561
- [grunts]

19:21.594 --> 19:23.896
- THE PLATENS
ON THESE WASHINGTONS

19:23.930 --> 19:26.333
GET STUCK
FROM TIME TO TIME.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.235
YOU MIGHT WANT TO REPLACE
THE COIL SPRINGS.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.437
THEY TEND TO RUST.

19:32.405 --> 19:35.942
I WAS A NEWSPAPERMAN MYSELF...

19:38.010 --> 19:40.280
BEFORE THE WAR, THAT IS.

19:40.313 --> 19:41.481
- OH.

19:41.514 --> 19:44.384
WELL, THANK YOU, MISTER...

19:44.417 --> 19:46.753
- JOHN CAMPBELL,

19:46.786 --> 19:50.290
PROVISIONAL GOVERNOR
OF THE WYOMING TERRITORY

19:50.323 --> 19:53.260
BY APPOINTMENT
OF GENERAL GRANT.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.762
- WELL, THEN, YOU MIND
IF I ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS

19:55.795 --> 19:58.331
FOR THE LEADER, THEN,
GOVERNOR?

19:58.365 --> 20:01.301
- NOT AT ALL.

20:01.334 --> 20:02.935
[laughter]

20:02.969 --> 20:05.438
[indistinct chatter]

20:05.472 --> 20:08.441
[piano music]

20:08.475 --> 20:13.480
*

20:23.323 --> 20:25.758
- AIN'T NO MAN THAT LUCKY.

20:25.792 --> 20:28.728
- JUST THE LAY
OF THE CARDS, FRIEND.

20:30.430 --> 20:33.232
- WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE
A SON OF A BITCH CHEAT.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.906
[gunshot, woman screams]

20:45.978 --> 20:47.514
- [breathing heavily]

20:49.416 --> 20:51.551
- YOU, SIR,
ARE UNDER ARREST

20:51.584 --> 20:53.486
FOR MURDER
OF THE FIRST DEGREE.

20:53.520 --> 20:57.457
- HEY! HEY!

20:57.490 --> 21:00.460
WHAT'S THIS, THEN?
- HE WAS TRYIN' TO SWINDLE ME.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.562
AIN'T THAT MANY 6s
IN NO DECK OF CARDS

21:02.595 --> 21:05.332
I EVER HEARD OF.
- WHO ARE YOU?

21:05.332 --> 21:07.334
- MICKEY MCGINNES,

21:07.367 --> 21:10.002
THE OWNER OF THIS CASINO
AND THE MAYOR OF CHEYENNE.

21:10.036 --> 21:12.672
- AND I'M
YOUR NEW FEDERAL MARSHAL.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.444
I'M CHARGING THIS MAN
WITH MURDER.

21:17.477 --> 21:20.347
- CHECK HIM, MICKEY.
HE HAD 6s ALL DAY.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.351
- JUST...

21:24.351 --> 21:26.353
- DON'T MOVE.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.707
- YOU'RE CAUGHT CHEATIN'
AROUND THESE PARTS,

21:47.740 --> 21:51.043
YOU'RE LIABLE TO GET
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA GET.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.479
IT'S THE RULE
OF THE LAW.

21:52.512 --> 21:56.115
- [chuckles]
THE RULE OF THE LAW?

21:56.148 --> 21:57.384
- AYE.

21:57.417 --> 21:58.885
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

21:58.918 --> 22:01.988
- YOU EVER HEARD OF SUCH
A RULE OF LAW, JUDGE?

22:02.021 --> 22:04.657
- CAN'T SAY I HAVE.
- HUH?

22:04.691 --> 22:07.059
HOW SHALL WE PROCEED,
YOUR HONOR?

22:07.093 --> 22:09.462
- I BELIEVE A TRIAL
IS IN ORDER.

22:09.496 --> 22:11.664
- A TRIAL?

22:11.698 --> 22:13.533
- AN EXPEDITIOUS TRIAL.

22:13.566 --> 22:15.435
- [chuckles]

22:20.106 --> 22:22.409
- WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

22:25.578 --> 22:27.947
OUT THE WAY WITH YA!

22:43.496 --> 22:45.698
- CHEYENNE HAS BEEN TOUTED

22:45.732 --> 22:49.436
AS THE MAGIC CITY
OF THE PLAINS.

22:49.436 --> 22:52.672
IT'S MY JOB TO GOVERN IT
INTO A NEW ERA,

22:52.705 --> 22:56.008
AS I DID IN THE SOUTH
FOLLOWING THE WAR.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.445
- YOU WERE PART OF JOHNSON'S
RECONSTRUCTION EFFORT?

22:58.445 --> 22:59.779
- YES.

22:59.812 --> 23:02.449
PART OF THAT SUCCESS.
I WAS COMM--

23:02.449 --> 23:05.452
- UH, WHICH SUCCESS
WOULD THAT BE?

23:05.452 --> 23:08.087
RESTORING RICH, WHITE
SOUTHERNERS BACK INTO POWER

23:08.120 --> 23:11.458
OR THE PERSECUTION
OF THE NEWLY FREED NEGRO?

23:13.460 --> 23:15.495
- I WAS A CORRECTIVE

23:15.528 --> 23:19.599
TO PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S
LACK OF RESOLVE IN ATLANTA.

23:19.632 --> 23:23.135
WE BENT THE CITY
TO THE NATIONAL WILL,

23:23.169 --> 23:26.939
AS I INTEND TO DO
IN CHEYENNE...

23:26.973 --> 23:29.509
WITH OR WITHOUT THE HELP
OF THOMAS DURANT.

23:29.542 --> 23:31.478
[gunshot]

23:31.511 --> 23:35.047
- GUNSHOTS ARE A COMMON
OCCURRENCE IN CHEYENNE,

23:35.081 --> 23:37.617
MR. CAMPBELL.

23:37.650 --> 23:40.487
REGARDING MR. DURANT,
MAY I QUOTE YOU ON THAT?

23:40.520 --> 23:43.089
- I WISH YOU WOULD.

24:47.219 --> 24:49.556
- BLESS ME, FATHER,
FOR I HAVE SINNED.

24:49.589 --> 24:52.291
ONLY YOU KNOW MY HEART.

24:52.324 --> 24:55.227
FROM THE MOMENT YOU SAW ME,
YOU KNEW ME.

24:55.261 --> 24:57.564
I BEAR THE MARK OF CAIN.

24:57.564 --> 25:00.667
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

25:00.700 --> 25:03.135
I'M A SINNER,

25:03.169 --> 25:05.572
A KILLER OF MEN,

25:05.605 --> 25:08.875
ENSLAVER
OF THE SONS OF HAM.

25:08.908 --> 25:12.745
I HAVE DEFIED NOT ONLY GOD,
BUT YOU AS WELL.

25:12.779 --> 25:14.714
PLEASE...

25:14.747 --> 25:16.749
I BEG YOU...

25:16.783 --> 25:19.619
FORGIVE ME.

25:19.652 --> 25:22.655
- YES, MY SON.

25:24.657 --> 25:26.693
I'M LISTENING.

25:26.726 --> 25:29.596
- [crying]

25:33.966 --> 25:35.835
- LEAD ME TO YOUR HEART,
I PRAY YOU, BISHOP DUTSON.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.737
FATHER OF THE WARD,
GRACIOUS ONE,

25:37.770 --> 25:39.706
YOU KNOW ME AS YOU'VE KNOWN ME
WHEN HEAVEN WAS YOUNG.

25:39.739 --> 25:41.674
- YES.
YES, I KNOW YOU.

25:41.708 --> 25:45.645
I KNOW YOUR SINFUL WAYS.

25:45.678 --> 25:47.179
COME WITH ME

25:47.213 --> 25:49.649
AWAY FROM THAT PATH,

25:49.682 --> 25:51.618
IN GOD'S GLORIOUS NAME!

25:51.618 --> 25:54.721
- BY YOUR HAND, I BESEECH YOU
TO REMOVE MY SIN DEBT--

25:54.754 --> 25:57.223
SLAVER, KILLER,

25:57.256 --> 25:59.626
SOLDIER TO KEEP MY FELLOW MAN
IN BONDAGE.

25:59.626 --> 26:01.894
MISSISSIPPI, TENNESSEE,

26:01.928 --> 26:04.230
GEORGIA,

26:04.263 --> 26:05.932
ONLY YOU KNOW
MY DEPREDATIONS.

26:05.965 --> 26:07.734
- YES, I WILL TAKE THEM
FROM YOU.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.636
- OH, THE HURT,

26:09.669 --> 26:12.304
THE PAIN, THE DEAD,

26:12.338 --> 26:13.806
THE GRAVES,

26:13.840 --> 26:16.676
OH, THE PRISONS--
ANDERSONVILLE,

26:16.709 --> 26:18.645
MY GREATEST SIN OF ALL.
I'M GUILTY.

26:18.678 --> 26:20.747
- YES.
YES, YOU ARE, MY SON.

26:20.780 --> 26:23.950
YOU ARE EVIL!

26:25.685 --> 26:29.221
SO LONG GOD HAS WANTED ME TO
PUNISH YOU FOR YOUR ATROCITIES.

26:29.255 --> 26:31.658
- AND YOU HAVE. I'M INDEBTED
TO YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.

26:31.658 --> 26:33.760
- THANK YOU, LORD,

26:33.793 --> 26:34.961
HEAVENLY FATHER.

26:34.994 --> 26:36.829
- WHAT YOU HAD TO DO
TO SAVE ME,

26:36.863 --> 26:38.831
WHAT YOU HAD TO BECOME,

26:38.865 --> 26:40.667
THE SACRIFICES
YOU HAD TO MAKE

26:40.700 --> 26:43.836
TO CLAIM AND REDEEM ME,
CULLEN BOHANNON, SINNER...

26:43.870 --> 26:45.838
- YES,

26:45.872 --> 26:48.941
YOU SHALL BE REDEEMED,
MY SON.

26:48.975 --> 26:51.410
- WOUNDED, BETRAYED,
CAST OUT--

26:51.443 --> 26:53.813
YOU DIED
AND YET YOU WERE BORN.

26:53.846 --> 26:55.682
NO MATTER WHAT COST,
NO MATTER WHAT SACRIFICE,

26:55.682 --> 26:57.283
IT WAS JUSTIFIED.

26:57.316 --> 27:00.687
- JUSTIFICATION, ATONEMENT,
REDEMPTION!

27:00.687 --> 27:02.855
- THOSE THAT HAVE HAD TO DIE
KNOW THIS, EVEN BY YOUR HAND.

27:02.889 --> 27:04.691
- GOD'S HANDS.

27:04.691 --> 27:06.425
- RIGHTEOUS VIOLENCE,
THE HUMAN SACRIFICE,

27:06.458 --> 27:09.696
NECESSARY FOR YOU TO SIT AT
THE RIGHT HAND OF THE FATHER,

27:09.729 --> 27:11.363
THE RIGHT HAND
OF GOD HIMSELF.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.032
- DEAR, SWEET,
HEAVENLY GOD, YES!

27:13.065 --> 27:15.367
- BISHOP DUTSON
JUST WAITING FOR YOU,

27:15.401 --> 27:18.705
GOD'S OUTSTRETCHED HAND
WAITING FOR YOU TO TAKE HIM.

27:18.738 --> 27:20.873
- GOD WORKS
THROUGH MY HANDS!

27:20.907 --> 27:23.743
- THE BISHOP'S BODILY SELF
JUST WAITING FOR YOU,

27:23.776 --> 27:26.879
FOR YOU TO TAKE HIS PLACE FOR
YOUR ULTIMATE TRANSFORMATION.

27:26.913 --> 27:30.382
- WAITING AS GOD PLANNED!
- [shouting indistinctly]

27:30.416 --> 27:32.451
YOU SUMMONED
GOD'S RIGHTEOUS STRENGTH...

27:32.484 --> 27:34.754
- TRUTH!
- AND DID WHAT YOU HAD TO DO!

27:34.787 --> 27:36.455
DID AWAY WITH
THE PRETENDER DUTSON...

27:36.488 --> 27:37.957
- AWAY!
- SO THAT YOU COULD TAKE

27:37.990 --> 27:39.726
YOUR RIGHTFUL PLACE,
PRAISE GOD!

27:39.726 --> 27:41.728
- PRAISE GOD!
- BY YOUR HAND,

27:41.761 --> 27:43.730
YOU TRADED YOUR LIFE FOR HIS!
- GOD'S HAND!

27:43.763 --> 27:45.732
- BY YOUR HAND,
YOU TOOK HIS LIFE!

27:45.765 --> 27:47.900
- LIFE TAKEN--
- BY YOUR HAND,

27:47.934 --> 27:49.869
YOU DID AWAY WITH HIM WHO MIGHT
HAVE COME AMONGST THESE PEOPLE

27:49.902 --> 27:52.038
AS A FALSE PROPHET.
- YES, A FALSE PROPHET!

27:52.071 --> 27:55.041
- SO THAT NOW, PRAISE GOD...
- PRAISE GOD!

27:55.074 --> 27:57.409
- STAND AMONGST US
IN HIS PLACE!

27:57.443 --> 28:00.913
GOD HIMSELF HAVING CLEANSED YOU
OF BISHOP DUTSON'S BLOOD,

28:00.947 --> 28:03.750
FROM THESE HANDS!
- THESE HANDS.

28:03.783 --> 28:06.786
CLEANSED, PRISTINE,
IMMACULATE HANDS!

28:06.819 --> 28:08.054
PRAISE GOD!

28:08.087 --> 28:09.922
- YES, AND I LOOK UPON
THESE HANDS

28:09.956 --> 28:11.791
AND THERE IS NO BLOOD
THAT MAN CAN SEE,

28:11.824 --> 28:14.761
NOT ONE DROP, PRAISE GOD!
- BECAUSE...

28:14.794 --> 28:16.796
[breathing heavily]

28:16.829 --> 28:20.299
IT WAS IN A RIVER.
PRAISE GOD.

28:22.401 --> 28:25.437
A RIVER.

28:25.471 --> 28:28.775
[crowd murmuring]

28:33.913 --> 28:36.783
[gasps, breathes heavily]

28:52.799 --> 28:54.967
- [clicks tongue]

28:57.804 --> 29:00.807
[whistling Dixie]

29:00.840 --> 29:05.845
*

29:17.924 --> 29:21.427
- PRAISE GOD!

29:25.097 --> 29:28.200
[indistinct chatter]

29:28.968 --> 29:30.837
-THE BOY DESERVED IT.

29:38.210 --> 29:40.913

PLEASE STEP FORWARD.

29:52.024 --> 29:54.093
DID YOU BEAR WITNESS
TO THE OFFENSE

29:54.126 --> 29:56.963
OF WHICH MR. MCGUIRE
HAD BEEN ACCUSED?

29:56.996 --> 29:59.932
- I DID, JUDGE.

29:59.966 --> 30:02.902

THE COURT WHAT YOU WITNESSED?

30:02.935 --> 30:04.904

THE CASINO,

30:04.937 --> 30:07.506
I SAW THIS MAN

30:07.539 --> 30:11.210
DISCHARGE HIS PISTOL DIRECTLY
INTO THAT MAN OUT THERE.

30:29.661 --> 30:32.064
[groans]

30:32.098 --> 30:34.533
I DIDN'T DO NOTHIN' WRONG.

30:34.566 --> 30:36.202
VAN DORN--

30:36.235 --> 30:38.905
HE WAS TRYIN' TO TAKE ME,
AND I CALLED HIM TO ACCOUNT.

30:40.940 --> 30:43.910
I WAS WITHIN MY RIGHTS.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.948
HE HAD A KNIFE.

30:56.288 --> 30:58.925
- YOU CONFESS
TO DISCHARGING YOUR WEAPON

30:58.958 --> 31:01.961
INTO THE BODY
OF THE DECEASED?

31:05.064 --> 31:06.966
- WELL, UH...

31:06.999 --> 31:08.434
I SHOT HIM,

31:08.467 --> 31:10.937
BUT HE WAS COMIN' AT ME
FOR NAMIN' HIM A CHEAT.

31:13.940 --> 31:16.108

31:54.046 --> 31:56.248
- WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT
BISHOP DUTSON IS TRUE?

31:56.282 --> 31:59.285
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I LET HIM
HOLD OUR BABY.

31:59.318 --> 32:03.155
- YEAH, IT GAVE ME
A FRIGHT TOO.

32:03.189 --> 32:06.025
- DOES THAT MEAN THAT
OUR MARRIAGE ISN'T TRUE?

32:08.127 --> 32:09.996
- YOU AND ME...

32:09.996 --> 32:11.130

TAKE THIS.
HOLD IT UNDER YOUR ARM...

32:31.383 --> 32:33.685
LIKE IT'S A SHOTGUN,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

32:35.554 --> 32:37.156
LOOKS LIKE
HIS ARM'S BUSTED.

32:37.189 --> 32:38.690
PROBABLY AIN'T LOOKIN'
FOR A FIGHT,

32:38.724 --> 32:41.760
BUT IF HE IS, YOU GET LOW,
COVER THE BABY.

32:41.793 --> 32:44.663

I'D BE HAPPY TO SCATTER YOUR
BRAINS ON THAT ROAD BEHIND YOU

32:57.109 --> 32:59.378

BECAUSE YOU THINK MR. BOHANNON

33:55.301 --> 33:58.104
WILL COME BACK
AND SAVE YOU?

33:59.705 --> 34:02.208
OR DO YOU MAKE TROUBLE
BECAUSE YOU MISS HIM

34:02.241 --> 34:05.277
AND DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
ABOUT IT?

34:12.618 --> 34:15.721
I'M NOT SENDING YOU
TO THE ORPHANAGE.

34:22.161 --> 34:25.264
BUT YOU ARE
GOING TO BEHAVE.

34:28.300 --> 34:31.170

34:57.196 --> 34:59.165

34:59.165 --> 35:00.499
- ON THE CONTRARY.
