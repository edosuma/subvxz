01:29.630 --> 01:31.670
[fireworks crackle]

01:31.670 --> 01:32.900
- My father was a magician.

01:32.900 --> 01:34.130
He started out performing

01:34.130 --> 01:35.870
at the Minnesota
Renaissance Festival,

01:35.870 --> 01:38.470
the same place where Penn
and Teller got their start.

01:38.470 --> 01:40.330
Thanks to Harry Potter,
magic was a craze

01:40.330 --> 01:41.700
when I was growing up,

01:41.700 --> 01:44.270
and people were
really hungry for that.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.100
I now teach at Jeff McBride's
Magic & Mystery School,

01:47.100 --> 01:49.170
which is like
the real-life Hogwarts.

01:49.170 --> 01:51.570
Teaching magic one on one

01:51.570 --> 01:54.470
is what makes good magicians.

01:54.470 --> 01:57.500
You get way deeper

01:57.500 --> 01:59.530
I think magic
is a tradition,

and it needs to be preserved
and passed on,

Hopefully that's not a decision
I'm going to regret.

02:36.700 --> 02:38.830
One of the most
fascinating aspects

02:38.830 --> 02:40.100
of decision-making
is the theory

02:40.100 --> 02:42.300
that as the stakes
of a choice increase,

02:42.300 --> 02:44.330
our senses become more...

the situation safely.

a lot to see,
so it all takes place

08:54.730 --> 08:57.570
kind of in your head, right?
[laughing]

08:57.570 --> 09:00.070
I've always been fascinated
with escape rooms

09:00.070 --> 09:02.070
and puzzles
and classic board games.

09:02.070 --> 09:04.500
They have provided inspiration
to turn them

09:04.500 --> 09:06.570
into a mentalism presentation.

09:06.570 --> 09:08.300
This is something I created

09:08.300 --> 09:11.170
inspired off of
some childhood games.

09:11.170 --> 09:14.930
Will I fool Penn and Teller?

09:14.930 --> 09:17.470
"Better not tell you now."

09:17.470 --> 09:19.470
[cheering and applause]

09:21.900 --> 09:24.600
Please welcome comedian
and mentalist,

09:24.600 --> 09:26.870
Eric Dittelman!

09:26.870 --> 09:28.130
- Thank you!

09:28.130 --> 09:29.530
Thank you.

09:29.530 --> 09:31.130
[applause]

09:31.130 --> 09:33.200
Thank you.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.870
As a mind reader,
I've actually found out

09:35.870 --> 09:38.030
that people just often think

09:38.030 --> 09:39.930
dirty things all the time.

09:39.930 --> 09:41.970
Now, it's just something
in human nature,

09:41.970 --> 09:44.770
where we tend to go
to those inappropriate places,

09:44.770 --> 09:47.400
so I want to go far away
from that as possible

09:47.400 --> 09:50.200
and play a nice, innocent,
childhood game.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.500
A game of charades.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.530
I was really good at charades.

09:54.530 --> 09:56.830
So I need a couple people,
two people

09:56.830 --> 09:59.970
that are a bit outgoing
that, uh, don't mind looking

09:59.970 --> 10:02.600
a little silly or foolish
up onstage.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.230
Uh, let's get, uh--

10:04.230 --> 10:07.030
yes, the blonde here
in the blue dress.

10:07.030 --> 10:08.900
You'd be great, and, uh--

10:08.900 --> 10:11.730
How about the gentleman
with the plaid shirt.

10:11.730 --> 10:12.900
Yeah, pointing to himself.

10:12.900 --> 10:15.400
Would we please welcome them
both up onstage?

10:15.400 --> 10:16.800
As they come up...

10:16.800 --> 10:18.770
[applause]

10:18.770 --> 10:20.130
Nice to meet you.

10:20.130 --> 10:21.700
Nice to meet you, as well.

10:21.700 --> 10:23.070
Come on over.

10:23.070 --> 10:24.570
Come over by this stool.

10:24.570 --> 10:25.670
Uh, your name?
- Blair.

10:25.670 --> 10:26.870
- Blair, nice to meet you.

10:26.870 --> 10:28.100
You're gonna actually stand
right here,

10:28.100 --> 10:30.100
and why don't you switch with--
your name?

10:30.100 --> 10:31.330
- Brandon.
- Brandon.

10:31.330 --> 10:33.070
Blair and Brandon,
give them one more time

10:33.070 --> 10:34.070
a round of applause.

10:34.070 --> 10:35.070
Stand right there for me.

10:35.070 --> 10:36.330
Perfect, very good.

10:36.330 --> 10:39.000
I have with me
a whole bunch of actions

10:39.000 --> 10:41.830
that are fairly easy,
recognizable.

10:41.830 --> 10:44.230
Uh, they're actually
easy to do, as well.

10:44.230 --> 10:46.770
For example,
we've got "dancing,"

10:46.770 --> 10:48.170
"juggling--"

10:48.170 --> 10:49.700
That one's for you, Penn.
- Thank you.

10:49.700 --> 10:52.900
- Uh, "brushing your teeth,"
"playing trombone--"

10:52.900 --> 10:54.600
There's about fifty or so here.

10:54.600 --> 10:57.300
You can see all different--
"milking a cow."

10:57.300 --> 10:59.370
"Eating a cheeseburger."

10:59.370 --> 11:01.400
But those probably shouldn't
be next to each other.

11:01.400 --> 11:03.400
But you get the idea, right?
[laughter]

11:03.400 --> 11:06.070
Uh, Blair, do you mind
just, uh, shuffling

11:06.070 --> 11:08.830
those two halves
into each other for me,

11:08.830 --> 11:12.300
as best you can.

11:12.300 --> 11:13.500
Beautifully done, great.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.800
You even did the bridge,
very nice.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.230
And Brandon,
would you, uh,

11:17.230 --> 11:20.530
cut the deck
anywhere you'd like.

11:20.530 --> 11:21.830
- Um, there we go.
- Perfect.

11:21.830 --> 11:23.230
And complete the cut.

11:23.230 --> 11:24.230
Yeah.

11:24.230 --> 11:25.800
- Like that?
- Very good.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.130
Why don't you take the top card
and hold it against your chest

11:27.130 --> 11:28.330
so that I can't see it.

11:28.330 --> 11:29.670
Great.
And, uh, Blair,

11:29.670 --> 11:31.530
you're gonna do
the next, uh, card as well.

11:31.530 --> 11:33.500
So that way, no one can know
what you chose.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.570
As you do that,
I'm gonna turn away

11:35.570 --> 11:39.200
so just peek at your card
and memorize your action.

11:39.200 --> 11:42.370
When you're all set,
just tuck it away somewhere

11:42.370 --> 11:44.430
where I can't see it,
in a pocket or somewhere.

11:44.430 --> 11:46.000
- Ready.
- You memorized it?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.330
- Yep.
- Great.

11:47.330 --> 11:48.500
We're gonna start
with you, Blair.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.430
Go stand by that yellow mark.
- Okay.

11:50.430 --> 11:52.970
- Brandon, you can stand
over here by me.

11:52.970 --> 11:55.830
Blair, just think
of your action.

11:55.830 --> 11:57.730
Oh, interesting.
[laughs]

11:57.730 --> 12:00.130
In a moment, you're gonna
do this over and over again

12:00.130 --> 12:01.630
so the audience can see.

12:01.630 --> 12:03.570
Try not to stop at all,
just keep doing it...

12:03.570 --> 12:05.400
- Okay.
- Uh, but try not to make

12:05.400 --> 12:07.570
any noise, either,
that'll hint me

12:07.570 --> 12:09.200
into what you're doing.
- Okay.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.530
- Brandon, your job
is to watch me,

12:10.530 --> 12:12.000
to make sure I'm not looking.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.370
I'll even remove my glasses
and close my eyes.

12:14.370 --> 12:16.330
I'll do that.
Audience, you help me out.

12:16.330 --> 12:18.600
You let me know
how I'm doing, but--

12:18.600 --> 12:21.000
Blair, are you all set?
- I am set.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.100
- Ready, set...

12:23.100 --> 12:26.030
go!

12:26.030 --> 12:28.670
Okay I'm getting something
right away with your hand.

12:28.670 --> 12:30.670
It's kind of going
up and down a bit.

12:30.670 --> 12:32.430
That's kind of by your lap,

12:32.430 --> 12:34.170
and it's getting faster
and faster.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.170
Uh, it's like--
Oh, no, no!

12:36.170 --> 12:37.570
No, stop that!
It's not that!

12:37.570 --> 12:38.830
No, no, no.

12:38.830 --> 12:40.600
But now you're
holding something, like, long,

12:40.600 --> 12:42.470
maybe generous in size,
made of--

12:42.470 --> 12:43.700
made of wood, I think?

12:43.700 --> 12:45.130
Your fingers are involved,
let's start--

12:45.130 --> 12:48.130
No, I think we're gonna go--
are you playing guitar?

12:48.130 --> 12:49.430
- I am.
- She's playing guitar!

12:49.430 --> 12:50.900
Give it up for Blair!
Yes!

12:50.900 --> 12:52.870
[applause]
Yes!

12:52.870 --> 12:55.270
You're gonna switch places.
You're gonna switch places.

12:55.270 --> 12:56.530
Blair, come on over.

12:56.530 --> 12:58.630
Excellent, nice to see you.
[both laughing]

12:58.630 --> 12:59.800
You're gonna stand right here.

12:59.800 --> 13:01.400
Brandon--yeah,
right on the mark there.

13:01.400 --> 13:03.630
And you're gonna think
of your action right now.

13:03.630 --> 13:04.900
And you get the idea.

13:04.900 --> 13:06.630
You're gonna do this
over and over again.

13:06.630 --> 13:08.370
Again, try not
to make any noise.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.600
So think of it now.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.670
You seem a little bit
more hesitant, that's great.

13:12.670 --> 13:14.900
Uh, this time, actually,
because people think maybe

13:14.900 --> 13:17.030
I saw in some way,
Blair, come behind me

13:17.030 --> 13:19.030
and just over up my eyes, okay?
- Okay.

13:19.030 --> 13:21.030
- So no one--ah--
no one can see that I...

13:21.030 --> 13:22.330
- Am I covering?
- Yeah, perfect.

13:22.330 --> 13:24.430
Excellent.
Brandon, are you ready?

13:24.430 --> 13:26.100
- Ready.
- Set...

13:26.100 --> 13:27.570
Go!

13:27.570 --> 13:30.470
[laughter]

13:30.470 --> 13:31.530
Okay, I'm getting
that you're kind of

13:31.530 --> 13:33.200
going up and down a bit.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.200
Definitely some undulating.
[laughter]

13:35.200 --> 13:38.270
Uh, you don't seem to have
too much experience with this,

13:38.270 --> 13:39.530
but that's okay.

13:39.530 --> 13:41.530
But you're definitely
on top of something.

13:41.530 --> 13:42.770
And maybe there's--
you were thinking

13:42.770 --> 13:44.870
about smacking here or there.

13:44.870 --> 13:48.030
But, uh, there's an animal
involved, that's weird.

13:48.030 --> 13:50.570
No, get your minds out
of the dirt, the gutter!

13:50.570 --> 13:51.900
Get your minds out
of the gutter!

13:51.900 --> 13:53.130
This is, uh--
you're riding a horse!

13:53.130 --> 13:54.530
Are you riding a horse?
- Yeah.

13:54.530 --> 13:56.300
- Yeah!

13:56.300 --> 13:58.770
Brandon, Blair,
ladies and gentlemen!

13:58.770 --> 14:00.630
- Ah.
- But wait, wait, wait!

14:00.630 --> 14:02.070
Now, why don't we come
back here.

14:02.070 --> 14:04.600
Because they were so good,
let's have you do one more.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.600
Brandon, would you
unband the--the deck?

14:06.600 --> 14:08.700
And just cut it
like you did before.

14:08.700 --> 14:10.200
Anywhere you'd like,
just give it a cut.

14:10.200 --> 14:11.370
Yeah, perfect.

14:11.370 --> 14:12.770
And, uh, place that down.

14:12.770 --> 14:15.670
And you're gonna hold that card
against your chest.

14:15.670 --> 14:18.430
'cause this time you're
gonna do it together, okay?

14:18.430 --> 14:20.170
So both of you go over
to that mark--

14:20.170 --> 14:22.930
uh, that yellow square again.

14:22.930 --> 14:26.100
I'm gonna go far away
from you this time,

14:26.100 --> 14:27.400
In fact, we're gonna have
the audience--

14:27.400 --> 14:30.600
this whole section over here--
keep a eye on me

14:30.600 --> 14:32.370
to make sure
that I'm not cheating.

14:32.370 --> 14:34.300
So you guys keep watching me.

14:34.300 --> 14:36.100
Penn and Teller
can watch me as well.

14:36.100 --> 14:37.770
Have you both looked
at the card?

14:37.770 --> 14:39.830
- Yes.
- Blair, Brandon,

14:39.830 --> 14:41.170
are you ready?
- Ready.

14:41.170 --> 14:42.870
- Set...

14:42.870 --> 14:46.000
Go!

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Okay, you don't know each other
that well,

14:48.000 --> 14:49.430
I'm getting that right away.

14:49.430 --> 14:50.530
[laughter]

14:50.530 --> 14:52.170
There's a ball involved.

14:52.170 --> 14:53.700
Just one ball, though.

14:53.700 --> 14:56.100
Uh, you're kind of
running away.

14:56.100 --> 14:58.270
But, like, someone's kind of
bending over a bit,

14:58.270 --> 14:59.800
Like, I'm definitely getting,
like, a top,

14:59.800 --> 15:01.800
and someone on bottom, uh...

15:01.800 --> 15:03.970
No, you're--
you all have dirty minds!

15:03.970 --> 15:05.030
You all have dirty--

15:05.030 --> 15:06.200
You--you're hiking a football!

15:06.200 --> 15:07.570
Are you hiking a football?
both: Yes.

15:07.570 --> 15:10.400
- Yeah, give it up
for Brandon and Blair!

15:10.400 --> 15:11.730
Thank you guys so much!

15:11.730 --> 15:14.030
You can place--
you guys were fantastic!

15:14.030 --> 15:16.000
My name's Eric Dittelman.
Thank you, guys!

15:16.000 --> 15:18.130
- Eric Dittelman!

15:18.130 --> 15:19.730
- Thank you.
[cheering and applause]

15:19.730 --> 15:22.000
- That was very entertaining!
- Thank you.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.530
- I like that you add
so much, uh...

15:24.530 --> 15:26.570
fun to your act.
- Yes, yes.

15:26.570 --> 15:28.200
That's my main goal.
- You're not so serious.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.400
- Right, yeah.
- You're not a mentalist czar.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.330
- Right, yeah.
That kind of separates me

15:32.330 --> 15:34.030
from most mentalists,
'cause they're all, like,

15:34.030 --> 15:35.700
creepy, in-your-head
type of thing.

15:35.700 --> 15:38.800
My approach to mentalism
is we're just having fun,

15:38.800 --> 15:40.200
and we all think
fun thoughts anyway,

15:40.200 --> 15:41.500
so we might as well
reveal those

15:41.500 --> 15:42.770
and focus on those instead.

15:42.770 --> 15:43.970
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:43.970 --> 15:45.970
- And have you always
been into mentalism?

15:45.970 --> 15:49.170
- Yeah, I--I kind of started
with a magic background,

15:49.170 --> 15:52.470
but mentalism allowed me
to just present myself

15:52.470 --> 15:55.430
a little bit more of, like,
a standup comedian would,

15:55.430 --> 15:57.300
so it's just me
and my personality.

15:57.300 --> 15:58.830
You're not hiding
behind any props

15:58.830 --> 16:00.430
or anything, uh,
weird-looking.

16:00.430 --> 16:02.770
[chuckles]
- So if you had to choose one,

16:02.770 --> 16:04.770
comedy or mentalism--

16:04.770 --> 16:08.200
and it was like life or death--
which one would you choose?

16:08.200 --> 16:09.930
- I mean, they're
so fused together for me.

16:09.930 --> 16:11.370
It's all one performance.

16:11.370 --> 16:13.300
I'd probably
be doing mentalism,

16:13.300 --> 16:14.770
but it would have
to be funny, too,

16:14.770 --> 16:16.930
so I guess you'd just
have to kill me, right?

16:16.930 --> 16:18.670
- Oh, no.
[laughter]

16:18.670 --> 16:21.630
Do you think it's a good idea
to perform funny mentalism

16:21.630 --> 16:24.170
instead of serious mentalism
for Penn?

16:24.170 --> 16:25.830
- Uh, I think so, absolutely.

16:25.830 --> 16:29.670
I know Penn and mentalists, uh,
kind of have a rough history.

16:29.670 --> 16:31.700
And I agree,
I'm very skeptical too.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.770
I don't, uh, claim
to have supernatural powers

16:33.770 --> 16:34.900
or anything like that.

16:34.900 --> 16:36.630
This is all about
just having a good time,

16:36.630 --> 16:37.830
like I said, and I hope--

16:37.830 --> 16:39.970
hopefully Penn sees
that it can be performed

16:39.970 --> 16:41.630
in a way without
taking advantage

16:41.630 --> 16:42.730
of people's beliefs.

16:42.730 --> 16:44.770
Uh, that's really my goal
when I perform.

16:44.770 --> 16:45.870
- All right.

16:45.870 --> 16:47.200
Well, let's see
if Penn and Teller

16:47.200 --> 16:49.100
can figure out how you did it.
- Sure.

16:49.100 --> 16:50.670
- Penn, Teller.

16:50.670 --> 16:51.700
- Eric.
- Hi.

16:51.700 --> 16:53.030
- Nice--nicely done.

16:53.030 --> 16:56.330
There's always that--that
battle to make mentalism

16:56.330 --> 16:58.000
big and visual.
- Yes.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.030
- And bringing charades
into it is a really good idea.

17:00.030 --> 17:01.070
- Thank you.

17:01.070 --> 17:02.600
- And bringing up
attractive people

17:02.600 --> 17:04.970
to do slightly
suggestive things--

17:04.970 --> 17:07.170
bordering on genius.
[laughter]

17:07.170 --> 17:09.800
I'm not gonna say genius,
but bordering on genius.

17:09.800 --> 17:12.069
I'll tell ya, um,
usually we talk

17:12.069 --> 17:14.270
about these things,
we have all these boring terms

17:14.270 --> 17:16.569
like "switch" and--

17:16.569 --> 17:17.900
and those kinds of things,
you know.

17:17.900 --> 17:20.670
But this one, we actually get
to use a fun term.

17:20.670 --> 17:22.030
- Mm.
- Which is a term

17:22.030 --> 17:23.400
that people at home
probably won't know,

17:23.400 --> 17:25.170
but you will know--
"Mene-Tekel."

17:25.170 --> 17:26.900
You know the word "Mene-Tekel"?
- I do.

17:26.900 --> 17:28.130
- You do know
the word Mene-Tekel.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.370
- Yes.
- Yeah.

17:29.370 --> 17:30.970
Well, um, let me just
tell you right now--

17:30.970 --> 17:32.900
if it's not Mene-Tekel,

17:32.900 --> 17:36.500
may the fool be with you.
- [laughing]

17:36.500 --> 17:37.970
Well, I--
[stammering]

17:37.970 --> 17:40.430
- Did that make sense to you?
- It did make sense to me.

17:40.430 --> 17:43.070
I--I think they got it,
but will you at least admit

17:43.070 --> 17:45.030
I knew they were gonna
be thinking dirty things?

17:45.030 --> 17:46.400
- You were absolutely right!

17:46.400 --> 17:48.530
That is real mentalism,
no doubt about it.

17:48.530 --> 17:50.030
- All right.
- Thank you so much.

17:50.030 --> 17:51.730
- Eric Dittelman!

17:51.730 --> 17:52.770
- Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

17:52.770 --> 17:54.570
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

17:54.570 --> 17:57.530
[applause]

17:57.530 --> 17:58.770
- Don't go anywhere!

17:58.770 --> 18:01.900
More "Fool Us" coming at you
after the break.

18:01.900 --> 18:04.170
[cheering and applause]

18:04.170 --> 18:06.830
[jazz music]

18:09.500 --> 18:12.170
[jazz music]

18:12.170 --> 18:15.700
[cheering and applause]

18:15.700 --> 18:18.800
So far tonight,
Penn and Teller are undefeated,

18:18.800 --> 18:21.200
but they haven't seen
this next magician yet.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.500
Let's meet him.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.530
[fireworks crackling]

18:24.530 --> 18:27.230
- My name is Christian Engblom,
and I come from Finland,

18:27.230 --> 18:28.570
and I've been doing magic

18:28.570 --> 18:30.530
ever since I was
three and a half years old.

18:30.530 --> 18:32.800
I wasted my first
three and a half years

18:32.800 --> 18:35.070
of my life.

18:35.070 --> 18:38.100
I became known for a card move
that I invented.

18:38.100 --> 18:40.770
It's called the Anti-Faro--
where you spring cards

18:40.770 --> 18:43.500
from hand-to-hand,
and they separate one by one--

18:43.500 --> 18:45.200
and it became a legend.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.630
The effect that I'm going
to be performing today

18:47.630 --> 18:52.030
I have been tinkering on
for the past 21 years.

18:52.030 --> 18:53.230
I couldn't think
of a better way

18:53.230 --> 18:55.370
to do my first performance
in Vegas

18:55.370 --> 18:57.000
than on Penn and Teller's
"Fool Us."

18:57.000 --> 18:58.770
Guys, watch out.

18:58.770 --> 19:02.300
The big Finnish is coming.

19:02.300 --> 19:04.300
[cheering and applause]

19:06.970 --> 19:10.200
- With two randomly selected
members of our audience,

19:10.200 --> 19:12.600
please welcome Finnish magician

19:12.600 --> 19:14.270
Christian Engblom!

19:14.270 --> 19:16.100
[cheering and applause]

19:16.100 --> 19:18.400
- Thank you,
thank you very much.

19:18.400 --> 19:21.100
And, uh, thank you,
wonderful assistants.

19:21.100 --> 19:22.330
Your name is...?
- Stacey.

19:22.330 --> 19:23.600
Stacey, I'm Christian.

19:23.600 --> 19:24.900
And...?
- Walter.

19:24.900 --> 19:27.070
- Walter, wonderful.
Thank you for joining up here.

19:27.070 --> 19:30.000
Now, I do magic--
and card magic at that--

19:30.000 --> 19:31.570
most of the time.

19:31.570 --> 19:33.670
But I think that magic

19:33.670 --> 19:35.730
is very much like a mirage.

19:35.730 --> 19:40.330
It has that element
of being almost impossible

19:40.330 --> 19:41.870
and yet unattainable.

19:41.870 --> 19:43.370
Let me show you what I mean.

19:43.370 --> 19:46.000
Stacey, I'll ask you
to pull out a card.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.900
You can choose a card,
whichever one you like.

19:47.900 --> 19:49.630
And the same thing here,
Walter.

19:49.630 --> 19:51.230
Please just take one card out,

19:51.230 --> 19:53.370
and on the very face
of the cards,

19:53.370 --> 19:57.600
I'd like for you to sign
your names as big as possible.

19:57.600 --> 20:00.270
Try to do it in such a way
that I do not see the cards.

20:00.270 --> 20:02.730
And because
I'm a professional,

20:02.730 --> 20:03.970
I have another pen.
[chuckles]

20:03.970 --> 20:05.600
[laughter]

20:05.600 --> 20:08.400
So I'll turn around
and you can do that

20:08.400 --> 20:11.030
in complete freedom.

20:11.030 --> 20:13.530
Make it as big as possible,
and please guard the cards

20:13.530 --> 20:14.530
as I turn around.

20:14.530 --> 20:16.270
Is it okay if I turn around?

20:16.270 --> 20:18.300
It's all right?
All right, very good.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.670
I'm going to ask--oh, may I
have the pen first back?

20:20.670 --> 20:21.870
- Mm-hmm.

20:21.870 --> 20:23.400
- Because I don't want
to lose them.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.930
I'll ask you to put the
card back wherever you want.

20:25.930 --> 20:27.430
May I have the pen as well?

20:27.430 --> 20:28.630
Oh, you didn't close it yet.

20:28.630 --> 20:31.300
Don't worry about it.
We'll close.

20:31.300 --> 20:33.130
And would you put
your card back?

20:33.130 --> 20:34.830
- Already did.
- Already did?

20:34.830 --> 20:36.070
- Mm-hmm.

20:36.070 --> 20:38.670
[laughter]

20:38.670 --> 20:41.630
That's very fast.
- [laughing]

20:41.630 --> 20:45.630
- Do you mind if I observe?

20:45.630 --> 20:48.170
All right, uh,
twenty-first, maybe.

20:48.170 --> 20:50.300
Uh, Walter,
would you be kind enough

20:50.300 --> 20:51.300
to--to hold the deck?

20:51.300 --> 20:52.730
This is important,

20:52.730 --> 20:55.000
usually there's a lot
of pick-a-card tricks, right?

20:55.000 --> 20:58.430
But what really stands out,
what I want to do,

20:58.430 --> 21:02.100
is a pick-a-card trick
that's as fair as possible.

21:02.100 --> 21:04.200
You got to choose the cards
you wanted to,

21:04.200 --> 21:06.330
you signed them,
you put them back

21:06.330 --> 21:07.600
whether I was ready or not.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.330
[laughter]

21:09.330 --> 21:11.300
And here's the thing,

21:11.300 --> 21:14.530
I did see
where you put your card.

21:14.530 --> 21:15.970
So go ahead and just shuffle.

21:15.970 --> 21:18.370
Yeah, just give them a mix,
because...

21:18.370 --> 21:19.630
[sighs]
you might as well,

21:19.630 --> 21:21.770
because I have no idea
about Stacey's.

21:21.770 --> 21:23.000
You're happy with that?
- Yes.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.500
- May I...

21:24.500 --> 21:26.070
borrow the deck,
just for a moment?

21:26.070 --> 21:29.030
Now, I'll try to get, Walter,
your card first,

21:29.030 --> 21:30.670
because I saw
where you put it in.

21:30.670 --> 21:31.900
Uh...
[clears throat]

21:31.900 --> 21:35.100
Let's see if I can do it.

21:35.100 --> 21:36.900
[sucks in quickly]

21:36.900 --> 21:38.100
Done.

21:38.100 --> 21:39.600
[whistles]

21:39.600 --> 21:41.170
Flies away from the deck.

21:41.170 --> 21:42.670
Nothing in the hands.

21:42.670 --> 21:44.230
Feel, feel.
Nothing, nothing.

21:44.230 --> 21:46.830
And when I go in
to my back--

21:46.830 --> 21:48.170
excuse me...

21:48.170 --> 21:49.770
the other back pocket,

21:49.770 --> 21:52.570
I have one card here,
and one card only.

21:52.570 --> 21:55.130
Walter, is this your card?

21:55.130 --> 21:56.370
- It is.
- It is.

21:56.370 --> 21:57.730
Here.

21:57.730 --> 22:01.600
[applause]

22:01.600 --> 22:04.000
But...

22:04.000 --> 22:07.530
here's the real challenge
of this routine.

22:07.530 --> 22:10.430
Magicians are never supposed
to repeat their tricks.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.970
And I know, Stacey,
you're looking carefully,

22:12.970 --> 22:15.030
so the second one is always
a bit more trickier.

22:15.030 --> 22:16.900
I'll try.

22:16.900 --> 22:19.400
Oy.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.900
[sucks in quickly]
[whistles]

22:21.900 --> 22:23.230
[laughter]

22:23.230 --> 22:25.830
What can I say, I'm a--
I'm a child at heart.

22:25.830 --> 22:28.000
Your card has disappeared
from the deck.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.700
It's no longer
in the deck--

22:30.700 --> 22:32.670
no longer, gone--

22:32.670 --> 22:34.830
it just doesn't go
into the same pocket.

22:34.830 --> 22:36.730
Like a good pickpocket...

22:36.730 --> 22:39.470
I don't hide the loot
in the same pocket.

22:39.470 --> 22:42.230
Can you feel something here?

22:42.230 --> 22:43.670
[laughter]

22:43.670 --> 22:45.170
- Yes.
- You can?

22:45.170 --> 22:46.170
- Yes.
- Good.

22:46.170 --> 22:49.030
Can you please open the button?

22:49.030 --> 22:51.370
Can you put
two fingers inside--

22:51.370 --> 22:52.600
well, once you get
the button open--

22:52.600 --> 22:54.330
and confirm,
is there one card there?

22:54.330 --> 22:55.370
- Yes.

22:55.370 --> 22:57.170
- And tell us,
is this your card?

22:57.170 --> 22:58.330
Yes or no,
and if it is, show--

22:58.330 --> 22:59.700
- Yes, that's my card.

22:59.700 --> 23:00.830
Yes!

23:00.830 --> 23:02.270
- Ladies and gentlemen!

23:02.270 --> 23:03.330
[applause]

23:03.330 --> 23:05.730
Stacey and Walter.

23:05.730 --> 23:07.730
[applause]

23:09.830 --> 23:11.630
But...

23:11.630 --> 23:14.700
in reality,
this could be done, uh--

23:14.700 --> 23:16.900
if it were done
with sleight of hand,

23:16.900 --> 23:19.970
and--and cleverly so,
it's possible.

23:19.970 --> 23:21.930
But what you just saw
never happened.

23:21.930 --> 23:23.800
Like a mirage,

23:23.800 --> 23:25.200
you've been
witnessing something

23:25.200 --> 23:26.870
that isn't real.

23:26.870 --> 23:28.200
It just seemed like it.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.730
Walter, your card
could never have come

23:30.730 --> 23:32.300
from my back pocket.

23:32.300 --> 23:35.530
Do you know why?

23:35.530 --> 23:39.930
Because I do not have
a back pocket.

23:39.930 --> 23:41.300
[laughter]

23:41.300 --> 23:43.300
And you can feel it
if you want.

23:43.300 --> 23:44.530
- [laughing]
- It's okay.

23:44.530 --> 23:46.530
But--but of course,

23:46.530 --> 23:49.330
Stacey, your card could never
have come from my breast pocket

23:49.330 --> 23:52.270
simply because I do not have...

23:52.270 --> 23:53.600
a breast pocket either.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.500
[cheering and applause]

23:56.500 --> 23:59.270
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you so much!

23:59.270 --> 24:00.870
Thank you very much, Walter.

24:00.870 --> 24:02.930
Thank you so much, Stacey.

24:02.930 --> 24:04.570
Thank you.

24:04.570 --> 24:06.170
- Christian Engblom!

24:06.170 --> 24:07.970
[cheering and applause]

24:07.970 --> 24:09.370
Wow!

24:09.370 --> 24:11.600
That was incredible!
- Oh, thank you.

24:11.600 --> 24:12.830
- Whew!

24:12.830 --> 24:15.000
I was told you have
a nickname in Finland.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.270
Is that correct?
- Oh, yes.

24:17.270 --> 24:20.430
"The Big Finnish."
- [laughing]

24:20.430 --> 24:22.730
Nice.
[laughing]

24:22.730 --> 24:27.330
[cheering and applause]

24:27.330 --> 24:29.530
So tell me about the trick
you just did.

24:29.530 --> 24:32.170
Um, where was
the inspiration from?

24:32.170 --> 24:34.370
- Wow, this trick started off

24:34.370 --> 24:37.600
as a trick with a bill,
a note,

24:37.600 --> 24:40.730
and making the bill
switch or change

24:40.730 --> 24:42.530
in front of the audience.

24:42.530 --> 24:44.700
And from that trick, it morphed
into another trick,

24:44.700 --> 24:46.330
into a third, into a fourth,
into a fifth,

24:46.330 --> 24:47.800
until you see the end result.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.700
And it took somewhere
around five years

24:49.700 --> 24:52.700
before it went from one trick
up to the fifth trick,

24:52.700 --> 24:54.430
which is what you see now.
- Wow.

24:54.430 --> 24:56.700

a little dirty to other people,

put the card in with the pen,

exactly when you wanted her

36:57.630 --> 36:59.170
- Yeah, okay.
- All you're gonna do, Tom,

36:59.170 --> 37:02.100
is beat Teller
at one hand of poker.

37:02.100 --> 37:03.630
That's all you gotta do.
- Oh, okay, I can do that.

37:03.630 --> 37:04.900
- So we're gonna play
a game of poker.

37:04.900 --> 37:06.900
You know the ranks of cards...
- Yeah, yeah.

37:06.900 --> 37:08.430
- Okay--
No, no, no, no.

37:08.430 --> 37:09.870
You're not--
you're not gonna use these.

37:09.870 --> 37:12.270
See, Tom, right away
he was trying to cheat.

37:12.270 --> 37:13.870
You know how to check
for marked cards?

37:13.870 --> 37:15.270
How to check for them?
- Uh...

37:15.270 --> 37:17.130
- You do what's called
"going to the movies," right?

37:17.130 --> 37:18.200
- Okay.
- You just flip the back

37:18.200 --> 37:19.870
of the cards like this...
- Uh-huh.

37:19.870 --> 37:21.530
- And if anything moves around
on the back,

37:21.530 --> 37:22.930
those cards are marked.

37:22.930 --> 37:24.270
So those little dots
moving around...

37:24.270 --> 37:25.500
- Yeah, yeah.
They're all marked, right?

37:25.500 --> 37:27.070
- In any deck of cards
you check like that,

37:27.070 --> 37:28.100
you can see if they are marked.

37:28.100 --> 37:29.400
And also,
if I'm not mistaken--

37:29.400 --> 37:31.700
I know his style--
yeah, he's got two aces

37:31.700 --> 37:33.200
on the bottom
and two on the top.

37:33.200 --> 37:34.670
He can second deal...
- Oh.

37:34.670 --> 37:37.130
- And, uh, he can bottom deal
and cheat you that way.

37:37.130 --> 37:38.130
- Oh, okay.
- So we're not gonna use...

37:38.130 --> 37:39.270
- Oh, okay.
- These cards.

37:39.270 --> 37:41.530
We'll use cards
that he can't palm.

37:41.530 --> 37:42.830
Now, I don't think...
- Oh.

37:42.830 --> 37:44.800
- He can palm these cards.

37:44.800 --> 37:46.130
Put your hand there.

37:46.130 --> 37:47.330
Yeah, he's not gonna be able
to palm that, is he?

37:47.330 --> 37:48.470
- No.
- Uh, and these--

37:48.470 --> 37:50.230
these are not marked,
I don't believe.

37:50.230 --> 37:51.400
Nope, they are not marked.

37:51.400 --> 37:52.770
What I'd like you to do--

37:52.770 --> 37:54.070
he could also
do a bottom deal--

37:54.070 --> 37:56.530
why don't you just count off
ten cards.

37:56.530 --> 37:57.730
Just count off ten.

37:57.730 --> 37:59.570
We'll just use the ten
right here, yeah.

37:59.570 --> 38:00.970
- Okay.
- And this way,

38:00.970 --> 38:03.270
if he's only using ten cards,
then he can't switch,

38:03.270 --> 38:05.330
he can't bottom deal,
he can't do anything.

38:05.330 --> 38:07.730
So Tom's gonna deal out
the, uh, ten cards,

38:07.730 --> 38:09.770
and then Tom will beat him
at poker,

38:09.770 --> 38:11.330
and we'll go
another four years, here.

38:11.330 --> 38:12.570
- Oh, that sounds good.
- You got, uh--

38:12.570 --> 38:13.630
You got all ten there?
- Yeah, looks great.

38:13.630 --> 38:14.800
- Get these out of his way.

38:14.800 --> 38:15.970
We're done with those.

38:15.970 --> 38:18.330
Okay, Teller, now...
Tom will beat you.

38:18.330 --> 38:20.270
Go ahead, just uh--
just deal them out.

38:20.270 --> 38:21.430
- Okay.
- Now, I don't feel good

38:21.430 --> 38:23.970
about this, either,
because this way

38:23.970 --> 38:25.800
he could have controlled that
in some way, Tom.

38:25.800 --> 38:28.470
So you tell me:
which one of these cards

38:28.470 --> 38:29.900
do you want...
- Okay.

38:29.900 --> 38:31.170
- Which one do you want
Teller to have?

38:31.170 --> 38:32.530
You tell me.
It's your decision.

38:32.530 --> 38:34.400
Just win,
is all I care about, Tom.

38:34.400 --> 38:35.630
Just win.
- Okay.

38:35.630 --> 38:37.170
- Which one do you want?
- Uh, I'll take that one.

38:37.170 --> 38:38.670
- Take it, pull it towards you.
- Okay, thank you very much.

38:38.670 --> 38:40.070
- Put this one over here.
- All right.

38:40.070 --> 38:41.200
- Okay these next two
are gonna be dealt out, here,

38:41.200 --> 38:42.500
and you tell me
which card you want,

38:42.500 --> 38:44.230
which card will make you win.

38:44.230 --> 38:45.570
Come on, Tom, tell me.
- [chuckling]

38:45.570 --> 38:47.100
- Which card will make you win?
- Uh, that one.

38:47.100 --> 38:48.100
- You sure?
- Yeah--oh, yeah.

38:48.100 --> 38:49.570
- You sure?
- Mm, no.

38:49.570 --> 38:50.970
Okay, I'll take that one.
- You want to change your mind?

38:50.970 --> 38:51.970
- Nah, I'll go
with the original.

38:51.970 --> 38:53.330
- The original one?
- Yeah.

38:53.330 --> 38:54.630
- Wanna change your mind?
- Okay, this one, this one.

38:54.630 --> 38:55.900
- Okay, okay,
you already got it.

38:55.900 --> 38:57.270
Okay, well, the next one,
we're gonna have you pick

38:57.270 --> 38:58.370
which one you want
out of these two, okay?

38:58.370 --> 38:59.730
- Okay.
- Just do that.

38:59.730 --> 39:01.070
- Which one do you want?
Which one do you want, there?

39:01.070 --> 39:02.200
- Give me that one.
- This one?

39:02.200 --> 39:03.330
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay, slide it over.

39:03.330 --> 39:04.530
Slide it over.
- And I can just take it.

39:04.530 --> 39:05.530
- Okay, now I'll put
a couple for Teller.

39:05.530 --> 39:06.530
Which one of those do you want?

39:06.530 --> 39:07.530
Which one's a stinky one?

39:07.530 --> 39:08.600
Which one's a Limburger?

39:08.600 --> 39:10.070
Which one sucks?
- [laughs]

39:10.070 --> 39:12.330
- Give him the worst card
of those two.

39:12.330 --> 39:13.700
- That's the stinky one.
- Flick it over,

39:13.700 --> 39:15.200
Flick it over there.
There we go.

39:15.200 --> 39:16.400
Now, uh...
- Wait.

39:16.400 --> 39:18.270
- Which one goes
to, uh, Teller here, now?

39:18.270 --> 39:19.670
Which one goes to Teller?
- Uh, that one.

39:19.670 --> 39:20.930
- That that one to Teller
right over here.

39:20.930 --> 39:22.700
And now, we'll get another one
for you.

39:22.700 --> 39:24.530
This is for you, Tom.
Which one do you want for you?

39:24.530 --> 39:26.000
- Uh, that one for me, please.
- That one for you.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.170
- Thank you.
- There we go, here.

39:27.170 --> 39:28.730
- Thank you.
- And one more for Teller.

39:28.730 --> 39:30.070
- Mm-hmm.

39:30.070 --> 39:31.300
- Which one do you want
to go to Teller?

39:31.300 --> 39:32.430
Which one's the bad one?
- That to Teller.

39:32.430 --> 39:33.600
- That one's the bad one, yep.
Okay.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.630
Now, we got two left--
ah, no, no, no.

39:35.630 --> 39:37.230
Look at your cards, Tom.
- Okay.

39:37.230 --> 39:38.930
- We're gonna make this
so you can win no trouble.

39:38.930 --> 39:39.930
Look at them, look at them.

39:39.930 --> 39:41.270
Look at the hand you got.

39:41.270 --> 39:42.530
How about you do something
that's never been done

39:42.530 --> 39:44.270
in history,
because you gotta win, Tom.

39:44.270 --> 39:45.400
You gotta win, Tom.
- Yeah, yeah.

39:45.400 --> 39:47.700
- And you tell me--
you tell me, Tom,

39:47.700 --> 39:49.830
which one of these cards
would make your hand better?

39:49.830 --> 39:50.930
- Uh, well...
[laughter]

39:50.930 --> 39:52.170
Uh...
- Which one do you want?

39:52.170 --> 39:53.370
- I'll take that one, please.
- You sure?

39:53.370 --> 39:54.700
- Yes, please.
- That's the one you want?

39:54.700 --> 39:55.830
- Yes, please.
- Is that the one, right there?

39:55.830 --> 39:56.900
- Yeah, yeah.
- And we'll give this one

39:56.900 --> 39:57.930
to Teller.

39:57.930 --> 39:59.030
What do you got,
what do you got?

39:59.030 --> 40:00.330
- Not bad.
- Oh, not bad at all.

40:00.330 --> 40:01.830
- Not bad.
- He's got a full house.

40:01.830 --> 40:05.230
- That's right.
- He's got nines full of aces.

40:05.230 --> 40:06.970
Nines full of aces.
- Not bad.

40:06.970 --> 40:08.430
- Okay!

40:08.430 --> 40:09.800
We got it, we got it.
- I'm pretty good at this.

40:09.800 --> 40:11.130
- And what's Teller got?
Let me see what Teller's got.

40:11.130 --> 40:12.230
- I am pretty good at this.

40:12.230 --> 40:14.230
- Teller's got
not even a pair--

40:14.230 --> 40:15.830
Yeah, he's got a--

40:15.830 --> 40:17.230
got a royal flush.

40:17.230 --> 40:19.270
You made every decision there,
Tom.

40:19.270 --> 40:20.330
Every single decision.

40:20.330 --> 40:22.100
You couldn't help us out?
- Wow.

40:22.100 --> 40:23.600
Wow, okay.
- Okay, I guess

40:23.600 --> 40:26.530
we'll see you all next year
from the, um...

40:26.530 --> 40:28.400
well, from the
David Copperfield Theater,

40:28.400 --> 40:29.670
I'm afraid.
- Yeah, yeah.

40:29.670 --> 40:31.100
- We'll be fired here.
Nice try, though, Tom.

40:31.100 --> 40:32.830
- Oh, thank you,
that was amazing.

40:32.830 --> 40:34.270
Thank you.

40:34.270 --> 40:35.570
[cheering and applause]

40:35.570 --> 40:37.530
- Tom Green!

40:37.530 --> 40:39.870
Thank you from all of us
here at "Fool Us."

40:39.870 --> 40:43.700
Until next time,
goodnight from Las Vegas!
