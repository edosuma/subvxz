Have a great trip
to Cordoba.

01:08.830 --> 01:11.210
You're going to love
the Choral Cascade.

01:11.210 --> 01:13.750
Are you sure you'll
be okay without us?

01:13.750 --> 01:16.000
A day at the beach
can be pretty rough,

01:16.000 --> 01:17.670
but I think
we'll manage.

01:17.670 --> 01:19.830
See you tonight.
Bye.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.460
BOTH: Bye.

01:21.460 --> 01:26.040
Okay, who's ready
for some fun in the sun?

01:33.330 --> 01:34.830
On the bright side,

01:34.830 --> 01:36.790
we don't have to worry
about sunburns.

01:36.790 --> 01:39.210
Or wear goofy hats.

01:39.210 --> 01:40.790
Get back!

01:44.830 --> 01:46.540
Window secured.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Cabinets clear.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.960
Pantry clear...
ooh, cookies.

01:56.170 --> 01:59.750
Armando, Private Higgins,
what's going on?

01:59.750 --> 02:01.790
We're here
to protect you from

02:01.790 --> 02:04.330
the chonopos.

02:04.330 --> 02:06.120
Chonopos?

02:06.120 --> 02:09.000
ISABEL: Hi, guys.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.580
What's a chonopo?

02:10.580 --> 02:13.290
Oh, I know. I read about
chonopos in school.

02:13.290 --> 02:15.000
It's an old
fairy tale.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.040
They're small, mean,
and have very big teeth.

02:19.040 --> 02:23.080
They'll steal your food,
put rocks in your pillow,

02:23.080 --> 02:25.420
stuff mud in your socks.

02:25.420 --> 02:30.330
They live underground, and only
come out during thunderstorms.

02:30.330 --> 02:33.040
When lightning flashes
three times in a row,

02:33.040 --> 02:34.330
that's when they emerge.

02:34.330 --> 02:37.330
- One.

02:37.330 --> 02:40.040
- Two.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.540
- BOTH: Whew!

02:47.960 --> 02:50.420
Should I remind them
chonopos aren't real?

02:50.420 --> 02:52.040
And miss
all the fun?

02:52.040 --> 02:54.250
So what are
we gonna do now,

02:54.250 --> 02:56.960
stuck inside all day?

02:56.960 --> 02:58.620
We can play
hide-and-seek,

02:58.620 --> 03:00.500
- musical chairs--
- GABE: I've got an idea.

03:00.500 --> 03:02.080
Let's play olaball.

03:02.080 --> 03:04.000
- Yes!
- Count me in.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.960
But olaball
is played outdoors,

03:05.960 --> 03:07.670
on a big court.

03:07.670 --> 03:09.580
Hmm.

03:09.580 --> 03:10.960
It doesn't have to be.

03:10.960 --> 03:15.830
Welcome to the Royal
Indoor Olaball Stadium!

03:15.830 --> 03:17.380
Oh, I call Gabe.

03:17.380 --> 03:19.040
- Great.
- I call Mateo.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.880
- Yes.
- GABE: Let's play!

03:20.880 --> 03:22.250
Wait. What about me?

03:22.250 --> 03:24.500
Isa, you play olaball?

03:24.500 --> 03:27.120
Not yet, but I just
read a book about it,

03:27.120 --> 03:28.540
and wanted to
give it a try.

03:28.540 --> 03:31.750
Well, it can get
pretty rough.

03:31.750 --> 03:33.670
Especially for
someone so little.

03:33.670 --> 03:35.000
Maybe you could
be the referee.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.920
No, thanks.
I wanna play.

03:36.920 --> 03:38.790
Okay, you're
on my team.

03:38.790 --> 03:40.540
Great. What position?

03:40.540 --> 03:42.170
Let's play some olaball!

03:43.290 --> 03:44.750
I got it.

03:44.750 --> 03:45.920
Hey!

03:48.920 --> 03:51.710
I'm open.
Over here.

03:53.710 --> 03:55.170
Score!

03:55.170 --> 03:57.790
Up high.

03:57.790 --> 04:00.290
You wanna make it
interesting?

04:00.290 --> 04:02.120
You're on.

04:02.120 --> 04:04.250
Oh, good. Now we'll all
get a chance to play.

04:11.040 --> 04:12.880
Right here.
I'm open.

04:15.670 --> 04:16.880
I'm open.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.120
Mateo, I'm open.
Wide open.

04:21.120 --> 04:22.750
Elena, alley-oop.

04:22.750 --> 04:23.960
Through the hoop.

04:23.960 --> 04:26.000
Yes!

04:26.000 --> 04:27.170
Great shot.

04:27.170 --> 04:30.000
MATEO: Best two
out of three.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.960
GABE: Let's play!

04:34.000 --> 04:35.120
NAOMI: Go big!

04:45.790 --> 04:48.000
NAOMI: Gabe!

04:48.000 --> 04:49.420
Dragon slayer!

04:54.540 --> 04:56.040
I don't believe it.

04:58.290 --> 05:00.290
Guess I don't know
my own strength.

05:00.290 --> 05:02.120
No. Look.

05:04.830 --> 05:08.080
Looks like an old
Maruvian ruin.

05:08.080 --> 05:11.290
Underneath the castle?
Let's check it out.

05:11.290 --> 05:13.290
You sure? Maybe
it was hidden
for a reason.

05:13.290 --> 05:15.460
Okay, so we'll
be careful.

05:22.250 --> 05:24.170
Pawn to queen four.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.500
Your move.

05:31.580 --> 05:33.250
Hmm.

05:33.250 --> 05:36.080
Knight to king's
bishop six.

05:37.580 --> 05:39.170
Who needs olaball?

05:48.120 --> 05:49.920
Hey, look at that.

06:05.750 --> 06:07.580
Whoa. It's on fire.

06:07.580 --> 06:09.250
No, it just
looks that way

06:09.250 --> 06:11.290
because it's
a fire opal.

06:11.290 --> 06:14.330
It looks hot,
but it's cold as ice.
Go on, touch it.

06:14.330 --> 06:16.750
No way.
I'm not touching it.

06:16.750 --> 06:19.000
Come on, we'll all
do it together.

06:22.960 --> 06:24.670
Oh, it is cold.

06:33.460 --> 06:35.120
I feel weird.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.380
- It had to be the opal.
It must be enchanted.

06:45.380 --> 06:47.920
Enchanted?

06:47.920 --> 06:50.710
Uh, guys,
I can't get up.

06:52.290 --> 06:53.880
Maybe it's
some kind of curse.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.960
Well, it's certainly
not a blessing.

06:55.960 --> 06:58.170
- But you can
undo it, right?
- I don't know.

06:58.170 --> 07:00.540
We can look for a counter
spell in my Codex Maru.

07:00.540 --> 07:02.120
Then let's go.

07:08.460 --> 07:10.210
Oh, come on!

07:12.290 --> 07:14.500
Okay, we have to be careful.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.040
We're not the same size
as we were before.

07:17.040 --> 07:19.330
So the stairs are going
to be tougher going up

07:19.330 --> 07:20.620
than they were coming down.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.250
NAOMI:
You're not kidding.

07:27.460 --> 07:29.080
That's gonna
take forever.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.330
Isa!
Help!

07:31.330 --> 07:34.040
- Armando!
- Higgins!

07:34.040 --> 07:36.460
They're never gonna
hear us down here.

07:36.460 --> 07:38.040
The storm's
too loud.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.580
And we're too little.

07:39.580 --> 07:41.880
Then we'll just
have to climb it.
Give me a boost.

07:50.500 --> 07:53.210
See any chonopos?

07:53.210 --> 07:54.500
No.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.420
I don't hear
anyone either.

07:56.420 --> 07:58.500
If the chonopos
got Princess Elena...

07:58.500 --> 08:00.580
Then they'll
leave us alone.

08:02.170 --> 08:03.380
Private Higgins.

08:03.380 --> 08:06.330
It is our duty
as chief of the castle,

08:06.330 --> 08:08.330
and a private in
Avalor's army,

08:08.330 --> 08:10.290
to protect
our crown princess,

08:10.290 --> 08:12.170
no matter what.

08:12.170 --> 08:13.670
Now fall in.

08:15.460 --> 08:17.120
That is an order, private.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.500
Yes, sir.

( all grunting
and groaning )

09:29.290 --> 09:32.120
- GABE: Watch the corners.
- You're stepping on my face.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.920
What else am I
supposed to step on?

09:33.920 --> 09:35.960
Guys, we have
to work together.

09:35.960 --> 09:38.170
Easy for her to say.
She's on top.

09:38.170 --> 09:41.080
- ELENA: I heard that.
- You were supposed to.

09:43.880 --> 09:46.170
Okay. Okay.

09:46.170 --> 09:48.080
Only 15 more to go.

09:54.080 --> 09:55.500
Where is everyone?

09:55.500 --> 09:57.290
Maybe the chonopos
got them.

10:00.460 --> 10:01.960
Oh, what's that?

10:10.420 --> 10:12.380
BOTH: Chonopos!

10:12.380 --> 10:14.080
ALL: Higgins, Armando!

10:14.080 --> 10:16.500
The chonopos
know our names!

10:16.500 --> 10:18.500
Quick.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.710
- ELENA: Armando, it's me.
- Shut them in.

10:20.710 --> 10:23.290
Chonopos are crafty,

10:23.290 --> 10:25.500
but this should
hold them long enough.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.960
Long enough for us
to escape.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.120
Long enough to get
reinforcements.

10:33.330 --> 10:35.120
NAOMI:
It won't budge.

10:35.120 --> 10:36.540
They think
we're chonopos.

10:36.540 --> 10:38.540
How are we gonna get
to my workshop

10:38.540 --> 10:39.540
for the reversal spell?

10:39.540 --> 10:41.460
We have to find
another way out.

10:41.460 --> 10:43.460
Maybe there's another
way out down there.

10:45.620 --> 10:49.120
Ugh! There's gotta be
an easier way.

10:51.580 --> 10:54.330
I don't know about easier,
but that's definitely faster.

10:56.290 --> 10:58.420
Hey, I landed
on my feet.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.420
Be right there, Gabe...

11:05.420 --> 11:07.500
as soon as we climb
back down.

11:08.500 --> 11:11.290
Checkmate.
I win!

11:16.540 --> 11:18.170
I lose.

11:18.170 --> 11:19.710
Again.

11:21.420 --> 11:24.290
Watching them play
would be more fun than this.

11:25.710 --> 11:27.040
Whoa.

11:30.210 --> 11:31.960
- We're here, Gabe.
- Finally.

11:31.960 --> 11:34.210
- Ow.

11:36.210 --> 11:38.000
If we can see
lightning from outside,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.420
there must be
another way out.

11:42.420 --> 11:44.500
NAOMI: How are we gonna
get up there?

11:44.500 --> 11:46.420
It's way too steep.

11:46.420 --> 11:49.620
All we need
is a running start.

11:58.580 --> 12:00.580
ELENA: I have
another idea.

12:00.580 --> 12:03.380
I'm not sure
I like this idea.

12:10.540 --> 12:13.250
Mateo, are you okay?

12:15.500 --> 12:18.120
Ha! I'm unbreakable.
Ow!

12:25.540 --> 12:26.920
Oh, made it.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.120
True, but now,
we're out here,

12:29.120 --> 12:31.670
and my workshop
is up there.

12:31.670 --> 12:33.250
Just what we need.
More stairs.

12:33.250 --> 12:34.460
I'll make a ramp.

12:38.670 --> 12:41.420
If my hands could
reach my eyes,
I'd be covering them.

12:46.790 --> 12:48.880
And that's how
you make a ramp.

12:48.880 --> 12:51.790
Hm. Come on.
Let's get to climbing.

12:53.670 --> 12:57.460
Okay, I'll referee
if that's what you guys want.

12:57.460 --> 13:00.460
Hello?
Elena?

13:00.460 --> 13:02.460
Guys?

13:02.460 --> 13:05.330
That's strange.

13:07.960 --> 13:09.540
Hmm.

13:17.120 --> 13:18.460
Hmm.

13:27.540 --> 13:31.170
A hidden ruin,
right here in the palace?!

13:31.170 --> 13:32.670
Awesome!

13:38.670 --> 13:40.750
Hm.

13:40.750 --> 13:43.540
How'd that get over there?

13:48.170 --> 13:50.380
Hurry! Let's get
to my workshop.

13:50.380 --> 13:53.080
What is with all
the stairways
in this place?

13:54.500 --> 13:56.750
Can't anything be easy?

13:56.750 --> 13:59.330
Not when you're
the size of a footstool.

14:05.420 --> 14:07.580
Is that a fire opal?

14:11.120 --> 14:13.540
How did the olaball
get down here?

14:13.540 --> 14:15.290
Elena?

14:15.290 --> 14:17.290
Mateo, Gabe?

14:17.290 --> 14:19.170
Hmmm.

14:19.170 --> 14:22.830
Didn't I read something about
never touching a fire opal?

14:22.830 --> 14:24.750
I better go find that book.

14:43.120 --> 14:45.790
We're too late!

14:45.790 --> 14:47.960
The chonopos
forced their way out.

14:47.960 --> 14:51.580
The fate of the palace
is riding on our shoulders.

14:51.580 --> 14:53.620
If only we had a clue
which way they went.

14:53.620 --> 14:55.580
A sign.

14:55.580 --> 14:57.620
A hint.
Anything.

14:58.790 --> 15:01.500
Where'd I see it?

15:01.500 --> 15:03.250
Here. The fire opal.

15:03.250 --> 15:06.620
Oh, no. I hope
they didn't touch it.

15:10.540 --> 15:12.330
We're in.

15:12.330 --> 15:14.330
Okay, royal wizard,
you're up.

15:14.330 --> 15:17.080
Get out your Codex
and biganize us.

15:17.080 --> 15:19.080
Um, there's just
one problem.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.040
Yeah, there's no such
word as biganize.

15:21.040 --> 15:24.420
No, the Codex
is way up there.

15:25.710 --> 15:27.120
And we're way down here.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.580
Okay, I'm coming up.

15:31.250 --> 15:33.880
- Ow.
- Ow.
- Ow.

15:37.040 --> 15:40.710
Just a little bit more.

15:42.330 --> 15:43.500
- Ow.
- Ow.
- Ow.

15:46.750 --> 15:47.880
Oh!

15:47.880 --> 15:49.670
Hoist me up.

15:49.670 --> 15:51.710
Next page.

15:51.710 --> 15:53.880
Next page.

15:53.880 --> 15:55.330
Stop. This should work.

15:55.330 --> 15:57.620
An enlarging spell.
Put me down.

15:59.880 --> 16:03.080
Gather round.
Ready?

16:03.080 --> 16:04.750
Grandeluq!

16:06.120 --> 16:07.710
Allow me.

16:07.710 --> 16:08.880
Grandeluq!

16:13.710 --> 16:16.750
- Chonopos.

16:16.750 --> 16:19.080
Why isn't it working?

16:19.080 --> 16:22.290
It is working;
it's just not
working on us.

16:22.290 --> 16:25.120
Whatever spell we're under,
it must be too strong to break.

16:25.120 --> 16:27.420
- You mean...
- We're stuck
like this?

16:27.420 --> 16:29.080
Forever?

16:33.960 --> 16:36.710
Hold still,
you nasty chonopos.

16:36.710 --> 16:39.500
Armando,
what's going on?

16:39.500 --> 16:42.170
- Stay back, Isabel.
- We'll protect you
from the chonopos.

16:42.170 --> 16:43.960
Chonopos?
I wanna see.

16:43.960 --> 16:46.290
Isabel, no!

16:48.460 --> 16:50.710
Is that... Elena!

16:50.710 --> 16:52.170
Yes, it's us.
We found this ancient ruin,

16:52.170 --> 16:53.750
and touched
a magic fire opal.

16:53.750 --> 16:55.170
- and then...

16:55.170 --> 16:56.710
You shouldn't
have touched it.

16:56.710 --> 16:58.250
Way ahead of
you there.

16:58.250 --> 17:00.500
It's turned us
into these things.

17:00.500 --> 17:03.330
We're trying to
undo the spell,
but it isn't working.

17:03.330 --> 17:05.290
That's because
the fire opal you found

17:05.290 --> 17:08.290
is an enchanted stone
called the Coza Kex.

17:08.290 --> 17:09.790
See?

17:09.790 --> 17:11.750
- ELENA: Uh, Isa...
- Oh, sorry.

17:11.750 --> 17:14.880
The Coza Kex
was created by
Maruvian wizards

17:14.880 --> 17:15.790
as a punishment.

17:15.790 --> 17:17.790
If someone was
behaving badly,

17:17.790 --> 17:20.960
the jewel cursed them
with a dose of
their own medicine.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.540
Were we
behaving badly?

17:22.540 --> 17:24.620
You did knock
a hole in
the wall.

17:24.620 --> 17:26.420
Why would it turn us
into tiny cubes?

17:26.420 --> 17:28.000
It doesn't make sense.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.670
What were you doing
right before this happened?

17:29.670 --> 17:31.920
Nothing. We were just
playing olaball,

17:31.920 --> 17:34.880
having fun.
You remember,
you were there.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.830
No, I wasn't.
I left.

17:36.830 --> 17:39.380
You did?
When

17:39.380 --> 17:40.920
Because you guys
were ignoring me.

17:40.920 --> 17:42.960
That's right.

17:42.960 --> 17:45.580
We kept passing the ball
over her head.

17:45.580 --> 17:47.080
We said
she was too little.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.830
That's what
we did wrong.

17:48.830 --> 17:49.960
Isn't it?

17:51.830 --> 17:55.790
So the opal cursed us
by making us little?

17:55.790 --> 17:57.040
It looks that way.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.620
I guess we did get
a dose of our own medicine.

17:59.620 --> 18:02.040
Now we know how it feels.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.670
Okay, then, how do we
get big again?

18:04.670 --> 18:08.790
It says "to reverse the curse,
undo what you did."

18:08.790 --> 18:10.040
How do we do that?

18:10.040 --> 18:11.880
Uh, I don't know.

18:11.880 --> 18:14.710
Apologize?

18:14.710 --> 18:17.290
Isa, this curse
made me realize

18:17.290 --> 18:19.750
how tough being little
can be.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.460
People can ignore you.

18:21.460 --> 18:23.080
Underestimate you.

18:23.080 --> 18:24.920
Step on you.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.670
It took us becoming small

18:26.670 --> 18:28.920
to realize we were
treating you that way,

18:28.920 --> 18:31.460
and we're sorry.

18:31.460 --> 18:33.830
It's okay.
I forgive you.

18:39.210 --> 18:42.880
Uh... nothing's
happening.

18:42.880 --> 18:46.040
Hm. Maybe since you were
cursed in front of the opal,

18:46.040 --> 18:48.120
you need to apologize
in front of it

18:48.120 --> 18:49.710
to make it un-curse you.

18:49.710 --> 18:51.250
Good idea.

18:53.040 --> 18:56.330
Armando, we're gonna
need a little help.

18:56.330 --> 18:58.920
Yes, your tiny majesty.

19:00.920 --> 19:02.210
Okay, here we go.

19:02.210 --> 19:05.500
Isabel, and fire opal,

19:05.500 --> 19:07.920
we're so sorry we treated
you like that,

19:07.920 --> 19:10.120
and we'll never
do it again.

19:15.960 --> 19:17.710
Really, really sorry.

19:17.710 --> 19:20.210
Yep. Super sorry.

19:25.170 --> 19:27.040
Why didn't it work?

19:27.040 --> 19:30.080
The book said to reverse
the curse, undo what you did.

19:30.080 --> 19:32.620
Maybe we didn't
undo the right thing.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.080
I think we should play
another game of olaball,

19:39.080 --> 19:41.540
only this time,
everyone plays.

19:41.540 --> 19:43.920
Oh, we need a goal.
A hoop.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.460
Got ya covered.
Private Higgins.

19:47.960 --> 19:49.540
Isa.

19:52.710 --> 19:54.290
MATEO:
Isabel, I'm open.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.000
No fair. Your team
has a giant.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.330
Elena!

20:07.170 --> 20:08.750
Cut him off,
cut him off!

20:08.750 --> 20:10.120
Mateo!

20:10.120 --> 20:11.290
Elena!

20:12.960 --> 20:14.790
I'm open!

20:16.000 --> 20:17.710
- Take the shot.
- Yeah!

20:27.880 --> 20:29.500
- We're big again!
- Yes!

20:29.500 --> 20:31.500
I missed you guys.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.120
Yeah!

20:33.120 --> 20:34.750
Thanks, Isabel.

20:36.120 --> 20:37.920
You're welcome.

20:37.920 --> 20:40.170
But I kinda liked
being the tallest kid
in the room.

20:40.170 --> 20:42.880
You wanna be tall?
I'll make you tall.

20:43.960 --> 20:46.000
Hey, wanna be on
our team?

20:47.120 --> 20:52.790
Welcome to the Royal
Indoor Olaball Stadium!

20:52.790 --> 20:54.120
I'm open,
I'm open!

20:59.170 --> 21:01.040
- Low five.
- Look alive.

21:01.040 --> 21:03.960
- In a row.
- Way to go.

21:03.960 --> 21:05.580
ABUELA:
What is going on here?

21:06.830 --> 21:09.000
BOTH: Chonopos!

21:11.580 --> 21:13.040
Is that...

21:15.960 --> 21:18.420
An olaball?

21:18.420 --> 21:20.170
Yes.

21:20.170 --> 21:21.620
We were playing
olaball,

21:21.620 --> 21:24.040
and accidentally
knocked a hole
in the wall,

21:24.040 --> 21:26.330
over there,
behind Gabe.
Gabe?

21:26.330 --> 21:28.000
Can you move
to the left?

21:28.000 --> 21:30.380
Uh...

21:32.000 --> 21:34.830
Um, I know we have
some explaining to do.

21:34.830 --> 21:37.120
You certainly do.

21:37.120 --> 21:39.380
How could you think if
playing olaball

21:39.380 --> 21:41.210
without your abuela?

21:41.210 --> 21:44.880
- Look alive, Nuñez.
- Isa! Go!

21:46.500 --> 21:49.750
Goal. Whoo hoo!
Way to go, big shot.

21:49.750 --> 21:52.750
Ha. Big shot.
I see what you did there.

22:02.040 --> 22:03.120
MATEO: Yeah!

22:03.120 --> 22:04.920
I'm open, I'm open.
