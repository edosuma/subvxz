WEBVTT

00:18.250 --> 00:21.291
I... am not a mother,
because childlessness,

00:21.291 --> 00:24.166
is the natural state
of the female author.

00:24.166 --> 00:25.750
Write that down, get used to it.

00:26.792 --> 00:29.000
Adam, you need to make
your own movie.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.040
It has to be raw
and honest, real.

00:32.040 --> 00:33.417
Like us with Hannah.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.542
RAY: Maybe I'd be totally fine
if I ended up like him.

00:35.917 --> 00:38.333
Well, maybe he wants you to have
a life that's better than fine.

00:38.333 --> 00:40.125
Hermie? Hey, wake up,
I gotta talk to you.

00:40.542 --> 00:41.250
Hey, Hermie.

00:42.250 --> 00:42.959
Hermie!

00:43.291 --> 00:44.792
Ow. (GROANS)

00:44.792 --> 00:46.708
Your urine tested positive
for infection.

00:46.708 --> 00:48.625
I'm not sure if you
pee after intercourse,

00:48.625 --> 00:50.750
but that can also help
in preventing it.

00:51.166 --> 00:52.333
Plus, you're pregnant.

00:53.750 --> 00:54.458
Do you know that?

00:54.917 --> 00:55.792
I do now.

01:04.083 --> 01:06.333
( music playing )

01:39.333 --> 01:41.041
- Ray-Ray?
- Hey, Shosh.

01:41.041 --> 01:42.000
Hey.

01:43.417 --> 01:46.000
I'm so sorry
about Hermie.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.250
Yeah.

01:47.250 --> 01:49.959
Turns out he actually had
a disease, the old dick.

01:49.959 --> 01:53.083
What did he have,
if you don't mind
my asking?

01:53.083 --> 01:55.834
Scleroderma.
It's a really
horrible disease.

01:55.834 --> 01:58.625
Leave it to Hermie
to find the world's
most obscure terminal illness,

01:58.625 --> 02:00.625
show zero
external symptoms,

02:00.625 --> 02:02.750
and then die binge-watching
"The Equalizer."

02:02.750 --> 02:04.834
Well, I know
what he meant to you.

02:04.834 --> 02:06.959
Yeah, it's a roughie.

02:06.959 --> 02:08.750
Yeah, I literally
hate death.

02:08.750 --> 02:11.041
Yeah, well,
it's right there,
right in front of us

02:11.041 --> 02:13.959
just patiently waiting
to take us all.

02:13.959 --> 02:15.542
No.

02:15.542 --> 02:17.500
Not me.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.792
( sighs )
No?

02:19.792 --> 02:21.542
Yeah, no,
it's super random,

02:21.542 --> 02:24.166
but I'm just not gonna die,
like, ever.

02:25.625 --> 02:27.041
Good.

02:27.041 --> 02:29.375
Good, 'cause I don't think
I could handle that.

02:29.375 --> 02:30.917
( keyboard clicking )

02:43.708 --> 02:44.708
Did you hear
about Hermie?

02:46.708 --> 02:48.250
Yeah, it's, like,
the saddest thing ever.

02:48.250 --> 02:50.083
I feel so bad for Ray.
Poor Ray.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.458
It's the best news
for Ray.

02:56.458 --> 02:59.917
He can finally install
that socialist library
he's always wanted.

02:59.917 --> 03:02.000
He inherited everything!

03:02.000 --> 03:04.208
He can do whatever he wants.
It's a new day for Ray.

03:04.208 --> 03:06.333
It's fantastic.
I couldn't be happier.

03:06.333 --> 03:08.083
You okay, Elijah?

03:08.083 --> 03:11.250
You're looking
a little unhinged.

03:11.250 --> 03:13.417
Ha ha!
No. No.

03:13.417 --> 03:18.417
I just ended up accidentally
taking, like, six Adderall.

03:18.417 --> 03:19.417
I stayed up all night.

03:19.417 --> 03:20.875
I did a real deep dive

03:20.875 --> 03:22.917
into Ryan Dillon Davidson's
Facebook page,

03:22.917 --> 03:24.542
and I found some shit.

03:24.542 --> 03:25.959
Are you still
hung up on that?

03:25.959 --> 03:27.708
Dude,
it's not healthy.

03:27.708 --> 03:28.875
Wait for it.

03:30.125 --> 03:31.959
He is replacing
the male lead

03:31.959 --> 03:35.291
in "Kinky Boots"
on Broadway.

03:35.291 --> 03:38.000
- Uh-huh.
- And his nieces are hideous.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.875
So many pictures
of his nieces on Facebook.

03:39.875 --> 03:41.166
All ugly.

03:41.166 --> 03:42.917
All of them, ugly.

03:42.917 --> 03:45.375
And then this news
about "Kinky Boots."

03:45.375 --> 03:46.834
What do I do
with that?

03:46.834 --> 03:48.083
When we were
in the Obertones,

03:48.083 --> 03:50.917
he was so terrible
at harmony

03:50.917 --> 03:55.083
that we had to arrange,
like, 10 '90s alt songs
for him.

03:55.083 --> 03:56.917
It was a disaster.

03:56.917 --> 03:59.375
I still listen to that cover
of "Semi-Charmed Life"

03:59.375 --> 04:00.875
just when I wanna,
like, feel cozy.

04:00.875 --> 04:02.959
- Oh!
- It's cozy!

04:02.959 --> 04:04.166
Hey, can you
clean your room,

04:04.166 --> 04:06.458
like, a little bit
before my mom gets here?

04:06.458 --> 04:08.041
I mean, it's pretty
revolting in there.

04:08.041 --> 04:10.417
I want it to feel
like adults live
in this place.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.458
You've gotta give your mom
a little more credit
than that, okay?

04:12.458 --> 04:14.458
She's way more chill
than that.

04:14.458 --> 04:16.041
We almost
made out once.

But what if
I want you to?

04:48.708 --> 04:51.166

to let me be sweet after.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.708

05:54.625 --> 05:57.542
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.
That was hilarious.

05:57.542 --> 05:59.291
You are incredible.

05:59.291 --> 06:04.250
Like, look,
you really captured, like,
the sort of inane prattle

06:04.250 --> 06:07.208
of someone who thinks
they have more power than
they actually do, right?

06:07.208 --> 06:09.291
- ( chuckles ) So funny.
- Well, thanks.

06:09.291 --> 06:11.917
I don't know
how many more takes
I have with the spanking.

06:11.917 --> 06:14.625
- I think you can do it.
- Oh, no, I think we're good
to move on to Laird's place.

06:14.625 --> 06:17.834
Oh, all right.
Well, I'm gonna
just make a call.

06:17.834 --> 06:19.625
Okay, yeah.
Let us know
if you need anything.

06:19.625 --> 06:22.333
- Water or something.
- Just one thing,
just one thing.

06:22.333 --> 06:23.792
- I have an idea.
- Yeah.

06:23.792 --> 06:25.208
I think what
we really need right now

06:25.208 --> 06:26.917
is we need
a tight on you

06:26.917 --> 06:29.875
of your annoyance at the fact
that you have to indulge her.

06:29.875 --> 06:32.083
You know?
I think that's important.

06:32.083 --> 06:33.291
No, I think we're good.

06:33.291 --> 06:34.500
Company move!

06:34.500 --> 06:35.834
( chatter )

06:35.834 --> 06:38.708
Company move!
That's company move.

06:38.708 --> 06:40.959
Mom, I can't get over
how great you look.

06:40.959 --> 06:42.875
It's the Weight Watchers.

06:42.875 --> 06:45.083
And I actually like
the meetings.

06:45.083 --> 06:47.166
- Are you making friends?
- I am.

06:47.166 --> 06:49.375
And I thought giving up booze
would be the hardest part,

06:49.375 --> 06:53.375
but one of my new friends
has a son with a medical
marijuana card.

06:53.375 --> 06:54.708
You're smoking pot?

06:54.708 --> 06:56.125
It's medical, Hannah.

06:56.125 --> 06:58.834
And I wish I'd started
earlier in life.

06:58.834 --> 07:00.959
Are you stoned
right now?

07:00.959 --> 07:02.708
I couldn't travel
with it,

07:02.708 --> 07:04.708
so I brought these.

07:04.708 --> 07:07.625
I had two worms
in the cab ride over here,

07:07.625 --> 07:10.917
enough to relax me
without turning me
into Cheech & Chong.

07:10.917 --> 07:12.333
Do-- do you want one?

07:12.333 --> 07:14.166
No, thank you.

07:14.166 --> 07:16.834
I actually have to talk
to you about something.

07:16.834 --> 07:19.000
Please, if it's
about your father, don't.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.166
We haven't been speaking,
and it's the best we've
gotten along in years.

07:22.166 --> 07:23.708
It's not about Papa.

07:23.708 --> 07:25.667
And, um,
before I share this,

07:25.667 --> 07:28.500
I just wanna say that, well,
I have thought about it a lot

07:28.500 --> 07:31.250
and it is something
that I really want,
I think.

07:31.250 --> 07:34.917
I'm also totally ready
for your critiques, warnings,

07:34.917 --> 07:38.291
admonishments,
admonitions.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.208
And I don't want you to feel
that you can't speak freely,

07:41.208 --> 07:44.041
but at the same time,
I do want you to know that
you're speaking to someone

07:44.041 --> 07:46.500
who's made
a very personal decision

07:46.500 --> 07:48.291
being that I'm pregnant.

07:48.291 --> 07:49.708
Pregnant.

07:54.500 --> 07:55.875
Seriously?

08:00.375 --> 08:03.542
Do you think
it's so insane
if I keep it?

08:04.708 --> 08:06.417
Wow.

08:06.417 --> 08:10.125
- I don't-- this is not
what I was expecting.
- I know.

08:10.125 --> 08:13.375
And I just wanna say
the father is not
in the picture.

08:13.375 --> 08:15.750
He's not even somebody
that I know.

08:15.750 --> 08:17.375
He's, like, a random
water ski instructor.

08:17.375 --> 08:19.291
I'm literally never
gonna see him again.

08:19.291 --> 08:21.083
And it's just--
I've been thinking so much.

08:21.083 --> 08:22.875
I've been doing
all the big thinking

08:22.875 --> 08:25.333
about the ways that
my life is gonna change
and the little thinking,

08:25.333 --> 08:27.041
like about how I'm gonna
have to start drinking water.

08:27.041 --> 08:28.875
And any way
that I think about it,

08:28.875 --> 08:30.417
I just get
this feeling...

08:30.417 --> 08:32.792
That this
is your baby.

08:33.875 --> 08:35.250
This is my baby.

08:37.082 --> 08:38.582
Wow.

08:46.250 --> 08:49.417
Ray:
It's so weird to see him
as a little kid.

08:49.417 --> 08:51.583
You know?
I feel like he's been
middle-aged forever.

08:51.583 --> 08:55.166
Yeah, we were all
little kids once.
It's wild.

08:55.166 --> 08:56.917
Look at this.

08:56.917 --> 08:58.375
Captain of the high school
tennis team.

08:59.458 --> 09:01.291
He won a game
off John McEnroe once.

09:01.291 --> 09:04.250
- Did he really, though?
- Allegedly. ( chuckles )

09:06.458 --> 09:07.750
Is there somewhere
you need to be?

09:07.750 --> 09:09.250
Nope.
Here with you.

09:09.250 --> 09:11.291
Okay, good.
I gotta show you
this VHS collection, then.

09:11.291 --> 09:14.083
It's amazing.
He's got every
Sam Peckinpah movie ever,

09:14.083 --> 09:16.959
the Dominique Dawes
tribute video from
the '96 Olympics,

09:16.959 --> 09:19.625
this amazing Steven Wright
live concert performance,

09:19.625 --> 09:21.667
and a ton of Skinemax--

09:21.667 --> 09:25.291
"Emmanuelle,"
"Red Shoe Diaries,"
"Young Ladies of Chatterly."

09:25.291 --> 09:28.417
- Oh, you know what
I just realized?
- What?

09:28.417 --> 09:31.417
I have Physique 57
in an hour

09:31.417 --> 09:33.333
in Manhattan.

09:33.333 --> 09:36.250
Oh, I thought you did
that 57 thing yesterday.

09:36.250 --> 09:38.166
No, that was
Quiet Pilates,

09:38.166 --> 09:40.125
but they're really,
really different,

09:40.125 --> 09:42.583
so I like to keep
a good balance of them.

09:42.583 --> 09:45.708
But, um, you know what?
I'll skip it.

09:45.708 --> 09:47.750
I'll be a little
misaligned this week,

09:47.750 --> 09:48.875
but I think
it'll be okay.

09:48.875 --> 09:51.500
And if you need me here,
here I am.

09:51.500 --> 09:54.000
Right,
I don't need you here,
I want you here.

09:55.333 --> 09:56.917
But if you need to go,
that's fine, you know.

09:56.917 --> 09:58.708
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't put words in my mouth.

09:58.708 --> 10:02.083
I want to be here for--
with-- for you
and with you,

10:02.083 --> 10:04.917
just maybe not
in this exact house.

10:04.917 --> 10:06.041
Right.

10:07.500 --> 10:08.959
Yeah, Marn,
if you-- you know,

10:08.959 --> 10:10.750
if you really feel
you need exercise,

10:10.750 --> 10:12.667
you know, maybe,
I think you should go.

10:12.667 --> 10:13.875
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:13.875 --> 10:15.166
All right, yeah.
That makes sense.

10:15.166 --> 10:16.500
And then we'll just--

10:16.500 --> 10:18.375
um, we'll just,
like, meet up later.

10:18.375 --> 10:21.125
- How's that?
- Yeah. Yeah, good.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.834
Or alternatively,

10:24.834 --> 10:27.875
you could go,
we could not meet up later,

10:27.875 --> 10:30.667
and instead,
we could just break up.

10:30.667 --> 10:33.291
- Wait, what?
- I think we should
break up, Marn.

10:33.291 --> 10:36.208
Ray, I think this might be
the grief talking

10:36.208 --> 10:38.500
and potentially
also the asbestos.

10:38.500 --> 10:41.125
You can't stand here
for 20 fucking minutes

10:41.125 --> 10:42.959
and look at some
beautiful fucking photos

10:42.959 --> 10:45.208
of my very beautiful
dead fucking friend?

10:45.208 --> 10:46.208
20 minutes?

10:46.208 --> 10:48.458
Okay,
just to be fair,

10:48.458 --> 10:50.041
it's been more like
40 minutes.

10:50.041 --> 10:51.542
We never even
talk anymore.

10:51.542 --> 10:53.041
We never hang out.
We never do anything.

10:53.041 --> 10:55.834
We see each other
all the time, Ray.

10:55.834 --> 10:57.375
Yeah,
after you've exercised

10:57.375 --> 10:58.792
or when your
online therapist's
husband is awake

10:58.792 --> 11:00.125
so she can
give you a session.

11:00.125 --> 11:01.458
I mean,
don't you-- isn't--

11:01.458 --> 11:03.208
I want more,
you know?

11:03.208 --> 11:05.500
I need more,
'cause we're not gonna
be here for very long.

11:05.500 --> 11:08.125
You know?
Very soon we're gonna be
on the other side of the dirt.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.208
You know, we're all
going to the same place,
each and every one of us.

11:10.208 --> 11:11.583
- And that place--
- Dead.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.083
We're all gonna be dead.
Yes, I know that.

11:13.083 --> 11:15.417
Are you really
this cliché, Ray?

11:15.417 --> 11:17.417
Someone
you sort of like dies

11:17.417 --> 11:21.333
and suddenly
you are rejiggering
your entire outlook on life?

11:21.333 --> 11:23.375
Why should I be
smarter than this?

11:33.417 --> 11:35.625
I'm not a bad person,
by the way.

11:41.125 --> 11:42.583
( door opens )

11:42.583 --> 11:43.959
( door closes )

11:43.959 --> 11:45.583
I don't want you
to look at me.

11:45.583 --> 11:47.583
Well, I'm looking
at you.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.375
You shouldn't
have to deal with this.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.875
I'm so fucking crazy.

11:50.875 --> 11:52.375
( sighs )

11:52.375 --> 11:53.834
Did you take
your medicine?

11:56.208 --> 11:59.000
- Did you take your medicine?
- I thought I didn't have to.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.708
- I thought I was better.
- Oh, come on, Mira.

12:00.708 --> 12:02.417
You know
you can't do that.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.208
It doesn't just fuck you over,
it fucks me over, too.

12:04.208 --> 12:05.792
Now my head feels
so noisy.

12:05.792 --> 12:08.250
- Well, of course it does.
- I just want it to stop!

12:08.250 --> 12:09.500
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

12:09.500 --> 12:10.792
Don't--
don't do that.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.291
Okay?

12:26.333 --> 12:28.000
I'm gonna
ruin your life.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.667
- No.
- I am.

12:29.667 --> 12:30.917
You won't even
know it.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.792
One day, you'll just--

12:32.792 --> 12:35.000
you'll realize that you're
stuck with a crazy person.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.500
And not just, like,
fun crazy.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.250
Just crazy, crazy.

12:39.250 --> 12:40.834
Hey.

12:42.500 --> 12:45.500
Well, I don't care
if you ruin my life.

12:47.208 --> 12:49.500
At least you'll have been
in my life.

12:50.625 --> 12:52.542
( sobbing )

12:58.125 --> 13:00.333
( sniffling )

13:01.458 --> 13:04.291
And cut.

13:04.291 --> 13:05.917
- That was great, Genevieve.
- ( bell rings )

13:05.917 --> 13:07.208
That was great.
Do you need a tissue?

13:07.208 --> 13:08.500
No, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.458
Okay. All right,
everything's in focus?

13:10.458 --> 13:12.166
- Yeah, it was good.
- Okay.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.375
- All right,
I'll be right back.
- Okay.

13:16.250 --> 13:17.208
What do you think?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.750
Um...

13:21.750 --> 13:24.834
Isn't she kind of being
a little heavy, like...

13:25.834 --> 13:27.208
- I mean...
- Heavy?

13:27.208 --> 13:29.041
...isn't she kind of
a shit actress?

13:29.041 --> 13:32.875
Are you serious?
She's so dropped in,
it's crazy.

13:32.875 --> 13:34.917
Hey, is it cool
if I take five to
call my sister?

13:34.917 --> 13:36.208
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, sure.

13:36.208 --> 13:38.708
Of course, of course.
Take-- take 25.

13:38.708 --> 13:40.417
( chuckles )

13:40.417 --> 13:42.917
Well, then I guess
I just don't understand
the point of the scene.

13:42.917 --> 13:44.750
It's about when Mira
goes off her meds.

13:44.750 --> 13:46.834
Yeah, no.
I know that.
Thank you.

13:46.834 --> 13:49.792
I mean, I don't understand
why there's this whole
romantic bit

13:49.792 --> 13:52.291
where you swoop in
and save her

13:52.291 --> 13:54.208
and act like you guys
are meant to be together

13:54.208 --> 13:56.708
when this is a movie
about a shit relationship.

13:56.708 --> 13:59.583
The scene is about the fact
that these two people,

13:59.583 --> 14:02.667
while they have a very strong
animalistic connection,

14:02.667 --> 14:04.792
they're ultimately only
gonna hurt each other.

14:04.792 --> 14:06.166
It's about the tragedy
of realizing

14:06.166 --> 14:09.875
the relationship
is too intense to survive.

14:09.875 --> 14:11.500
Adam, that's us.

14:11.500 --> 14:12.917
We're the intense ones.

14:12.917 --> 14:14.792
All you and Hannah ever did
was sit around,

14:14.792 --> 14:18.083
watching those shows
about when fat people
do up their houses or whatever,

14:18.083 --> 14:20.250
or you ate Frito-Lays
in bed.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.750
( stammers )
And then you met me, remember?

14:22.750 --> 14:26.834
And then you met me, and then
we had a real connection,
you had real feeling.

14:26.834 --> 14:28.208
And that's what
this movie's about!

14:28.208 --> 14:30.083
Did you even read
the script?

14:30.083 --> 14:31.917
No! No, I didn't
read the script!
I'm the producer.

14:31.917 --> 14:33.875
I don't need to read scripts.
I'm here to produce!

14:33.875 --> 14:35.417
And your handwriting's shit,
by the way.

14:35.417 --> 14:36.583
I couldn't read
a word of it.

14:36.583 --> 14:38.458
Wow!

14:38.458 --> 14:40.125
Cool.

14:40.125 --> 14:42.875
Oh, that's sweet.
Pretty cool.

14:42.875 --> 14:47.500
This is very dope
to come back to this
artistic vibe still going on.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.542
Wow! You guys are getting
to festivals, right?

14:49.542 --> 14:52.542
You guys are gonna do,
like, "Slamdance"?

14:52.542 --> 14:55.458
Oh, wait, hold on.
I don't want to
alarm anyone,

14:55.458 --> 14:59.583
but pretty sure I just met
my new soulmate.

14:59.583 --> 15:01.083
She's right out there.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.750
Her name
is "Zhan-vee-ev."

15:03.750 --> 15:05.792
She's out there
on the phone,

15:05.792 --> 15:07.917
and, man,
she is something else.

15:11.917 --> 15:13.667
Mm.

15:13.667 --> 15:16.208
Mom, aren't you
only supposed to have,
like, one of those?

15:16.208 --> 15:19.000
Must be a weak batch
'cause I don't feel nothing.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.834
Hey, Hannah, just think--
a year from now,

15:20.834 --> 15:23.875
you'll be washing
little bitty baby clothes.

15:23.875 --> 15:25.333
That's so weird.

15:25.333 --> 15:27.333
I've not even started
to think about that.

15:27.333 --> 15:28.917
I'll help you find
a good doctor here

15:28.917 --> 15:30.834
and we'll go together
and hear the heartbeat.

15:30.834 --> 15:32.875
You know, I loved
being pregnant.

15:32.875 --> 15:34.291
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

15:34.291 --> 15:35.500
All I ever hear
is how, like,

15:35.500 --> 15:37.000
bloated and disgusting
you feel.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.458
Like, I know Kim Kardashian
and Jessica Alba,

15:38.458 --> 15:39.625
they were so unhappy.

15:39.625 --> 15:41.166
Not me.

15:41.166 --> 15:42.959
I felt productive
every single day

15:42.959 --> 15:45.333
because my body was doing
this big, special job

15:45.333 --> 15:46.458
all on its own.

15:47.542 --> 15:48.917
I'm just glad

15:48.917 --> 15:53.375
that you've really, really
thought this through.

15:53.375 --> 15:55.000
I have.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.750
I mean,
I think I have, so.

15:56.750 --> 15:59.834
Good, because
make these choices
when you're young

15:59.834 --> 16:02.458
and you have no idea
how they'll play out.

16:02.458 --> 16:05.000
You know,
I married your dad

16:05.000 --> 16:07.417
and thought
that would be that.

16:07.417 --> 16:10.875
30 years later,
here I am alone

16:10.875 --> 16:12.542
on the edge
of a cliff.

16:14.250 --> 16:17.417
And this poor baby
won't even have
a grandmother.

16:17.417 --> 16:21.000
- What's that
supposed to mean?
- Think about it, Hannah.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.959
Your grandparents
took you and your cousins
to Colonial Williamsburg.

16:23.959 --> 16:26.792
Do you think I'm gonna
travel alone with this child?

16:26.792 --> 16:30.208
My kid doesn't need to go
to Colonial Williamsburg.
I hated it.

16:30.208 --> 16:32.583
I still have nightmares about
that guy with the stick
and the hoop.

16:32.583 --> 16:35.208
Well, I'm sure Tad
and his partner

16:35.208 --> 16:40.041
will be thrilled
to take your baby
to Colonial Williamsburg.

16:40.041 --> 16:42.041
Or we could all
go somewhere together.

16:42.041 --> 16:43.667
( scoffs )
No.

16:43.667 --> 16:45.000
Not gonna happen.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.250
I would sooner
shoot myself in the head.

16:48.250 --> 16:50.875
Maybe you'll
meet someone.

16:50.875 --> 16:54.750
Do you have any idea
of what my life is like
on a day-to-day basis?

16:54.750 --> 16:58.000
Yeah, you teach
and you have all your cool
new Weight Watchers friends--

16:58.000 --> 17:01.583
I can't even
go to the movies anymore
because I hate coming home.

17:01.583 --> 17:04.916
I sit in the driveway
in the car

17:04.916 --> 17:07.250
because I don't wanna
go inside the house.

17:07.250 --> 17:09.250
'Cause you're scared
someone's waiting
to attack you?

17:09.250 --> 17:11.125
'Cause, like,
sometimes if I come home
and Elijah's not there,

17:11.125 --> 17:12.791
I'll go through
the whole house
with a nail file

17:12.791 --> 17:14.791
and just, like,
open every closet door.

17:14.791 --> 17:16.791
No, no, no.
You got it backwards, kiddo.

17:16.791 --> 17:19.458
I know nobody's in there.
Who would wanna bother me?

17:21.208 --> 17:24.458
No. I'm alone.

17:24.458 --> 17:27.625
This is it
for the rest of my life.

17:29.041 --> 17:30.750
But you're not
alone, Mom.

17:30.750 --> 17:34.291
You've got me
and you're gonna
have the baby, you know?

17:34.291 --> 17:35.917
And you really might
meet someone.

17:35.917 --> 17:38.375
I know it doesn't feel
that way right now, but...

17:38.375 --> 17:41.417
( whispers )
Stop fucking
saying that.

17:46.083 --> 17:48.834
- Mom, I really wasn't--
- See you back at the apartment.

17:50.041 --> 17:51.959
I have five towels
in this dryer.

17:51.959 --> 17:54.417
- You can't wait one minute?
- I don't have a minute.

my laundry on the stoop.
Look, this is her dress.

Extra crispy.

She's saying something
about crispy egg rolls.

they be crispier?

It's-- you've gotta
act like you're in that
Halle Berry 911 movie.

19:25.917 --> 19:27.417
Keep her on the phone.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.625

- I can't run this fast!

Well, the last
place we saw her
was a Laundromat.

19:37.959 --> 19:40.458
So, you think she'd go back
to a different Laundromat,
Nancy Drew?

19:40.458 --> 19:43.125
- I don't know!
- What the fuck sense
does that make?

19:43.125 --> 19:45.000
- Loreen!
- Loreen!

19:45.000 --> 19:47.083
- Loreen!
- Loreen!

19:47.083 --> 19:49.208
- Loreen!
- Loreen!

19:49.208 --> 19:51.250
Men:
Loreen!
( chuckling )

19:51.250 --> 19:54.000
Loreen! Loreen!

19:54.000 --> 19:55.875
That's not helpful.

19:58.750 --> 20:00.625
- Hello!
- Hi!

20:00.625 --> 20:02.583
Hi, I'm looking
for my mother.

20:02.583 --> 20:03.917
I don't know
if you've seen her.

20:03.917 --> 20:06.583
- She's yay tall.
- Yeah!

20:06.583 --> 20:09.083
- Kind of spiky hair.
- Rocker chick.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.750
Rocker.
Like a Midwestern rocker.

20:10.750 --> 20:12.875
Hannah:
We're really
worried about her.

20:12.875 --> 20:14.583
She's pretty stoned
and we don't know
what's going on.

20:14.583 --> 20:16.125
Loreen!

20:16.125 --> 20:17.542
Loreen!

20:17.542 --> 20:19.959
I'm just hoping that
you could give us some k--

20:19.959 --> 20:21.333
Loreen!

20:21.333 --> 20:24.250
Would it be possible
to purchase one dumpling?

20:24.250 --> 20:25.291
Thank you
very much, Nick.

20:25.291 --> 20:26.750
And if you see
my mother,

20:26.750 --> 20:28.291
will you tell her
that I'm looking for her?

20:28.291 --> 20:30.083
- Nick: For sure.
- Much appreciated.

20:30.083 --> 20:31.625
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

20:31.625 --> 20:33.291
Loreen?

20:33.291 --> 20:34.625
Mom!

20:34.625 --> 20:36.792
Loreen!
Hannah, Loreen!

20:36.792 --> 20:38.083
What?

20:39.333 --> 20:41.166
Loreen!

20:41.166 --> 20:43.208
No. Sorry, sorry.

20:43.208 --> 20:44.917
Not Loreen.
Not your mother.

20:44.917 --> 20:46.291
Not your mother,
not your mother.

20:46.291 --> 20:47.792
- That was an ashtray person.
- Oh, God!

20:47.792 --> 20:48.792
We have to go.

20:48.792 --> 20:50.333
Hannah, come on.

20:50.333 --> 20:52.208
Move your
little feet.

20:52.208 --> 20:54.291
- Here!
- This is it.
This is it.

20:58.667 --> 20:59.792
Oh.

21:01.750 --> 21:03.542
Thank God.

21:05.375 --> 21:06.625
Mom!

21:06.625 --> 21:09.125
- Hi.
- Hey!

21:09.125 --> 21:13.000
( laughing )
My waitress is
allergic to soy.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.458
She works in
a Chinese restaurant

21:16.458 --> 21:18.667
and she's allergic
to soy.

21:20.542 --> 21:22.333
She's adorable.

21:22.333 --> 21:24.333
You're an idiot.

21:24.333 --> 21:26.041
Pot stickers!

21:26.041 --> 21:29.208
Mom, you cannot run away
like that, okay?

21:29.208 --> 21:32.333
This is Brooklyn.
It's one of the most
dangerous places in America.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.708
You don't know the terrain.
You're not Lil' Kim.

21:34.708 --> 21:36.083
She's fine.

21:37.375 --> 21:39.417
Let's celebrate.

21:39.417 --> 21:42.375
A toast
to Hannah's baby.

21:42.375 --> 21:44.875
- Mom!
- Oh! ( chuckling )

21:48.208 --> 21:49.708
Yeah, a baby.

22:00.208 --> 22:02.041
For real?

22:02.041 --> 22:05.250
I mean, I was not gonna
tell you like this,

22:05.250 --> 22:07.917
but, yeah.

22:12.083 --> 22:15.959
It's a fucking
miracle of life.

22:15.959 --> 22:17.041
Yeah.

22:18.625 --> 22:21.083
Elijah, come on.
I was going to tell you.

22:21.083 --> 22:23.375
Obviously, you're
the second person
I was gonna tell.

22:25.500 --> 22:27.500
Do not move, okay?

22:27.500 --> 22:29.792
You have really
fucked up my day.

22:32.458 --> 22:34.125
Wow.

22:34.125 --> 22:36.083
( sizzling )

22:41.166 --> 22:42.708
What?

22:42.708 --> 22:44.583
I'm sorry
you're so angry.

22:44.583 --> 22:46.166
I was going to try
and explain it to you

22:46.166 --> 22:48.250
if you just let me start
at the beginning.

22:48.250 --> 22:52.834
- No.
- No as in you don't wanna
hear how I got pregnant?

22:52.834 --> 22:54.166
Not really.

22:54.166 --> 22:56.125
Okay, why?

22:56.125 --> 22:57.917
Because to be
perfectly truthful,

22:57.917 --> 23:00.458
I think
it's a really bad idea.

23:00.458 --> 23:03.500
Okay, well, I understand
how it would seem that way--

23:03.500 --> 23:04.917
No, no, no, no. No.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.625
It doesn't
seem that way.

23:06.625 --> 23:08.125
It is that way.

23:08.125 --> 23:11.708
This is yet another
reckless, impulsive,

23:11.708 --> 23:13.959
typical Hannah decision

23:13.959 --> 23:15.458
like cutting
your own hair

23:15.458 --> 23:18.708
or cyberbullying that girl
you met at Barnes & Noble.

23:18.708 --> 23:20.083
We did that together.

23:20.083 --> 23:22.500
That was something we chose
to do together for fun.

23:22.500 --> 23:25.333
- So, I guess
you're gonna move out now?
- Well, I wasn't planning on it.

23:25.333 --> 23:28.458
Pfft, well,
I wasn't planning on sharing
an apartment with some--

23:28.458 --> 23:29.792
do you mind?

23:29.792 --> 23:34.458
With some boring,
27-year-old single mom.

23:34.458 --> 23:35.792
Well, I don't
have to be boring.

23:35.792 --> 23:37.667
I could be a cool
single mom, you know,

23:37.667 --> 23:39.834
like Lorelai Gilmore.

23:39.834 --> 23:41.667
- ( scoffs )
- Elijah, I don't know
what to say.

23:41.667 --> 23:44.417
I always told you I wanted
to be a mother someday.

23:44.417 --> 23:47.959
Yeah, one day.
You said one day
you wanted to be a mother.

23:49.208 --> 23:50.625
We got a really special,

23:50.625 --> 23:54.000
specific thing going on,
you and me, yeah?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.417
- Yes.
- Yeah!

23:55.417 --> 23:58.792
And you just decided
to go and ruin it
with some baby.

23:58.792 --> 24:01.333
I'm not gonna act like
that's not what's
going on, okay?

24:01.333 --> 24:03.208
It's fine if that's
what you wanna do,

24:03.208 --> 24:05.708
but...
( scoffs )

24:05.708 --> 24:08.667
Elijah, I understand
that this might seem crazy,

24:08.667 --> 24:10.792
but you know what?
I need you.

24:10.792 --> 24:13.875
I really do.
It's not like there's
a dad in the picture.

24:13.875 --> 24:16.959
- I thought we could
do this together.
- Oh, really?

24:16.959 --> 24:19.500
You need help,
and you just thought
I would help you

24:19.500 --> 24:22.583
raise your--
your fatherless baby?

24:22.583 --> 24:24.417
You don't think
I have plans?

24:24.417 --> 24:27.417
What's your plan,
to, like, smoke salvia
at 10:00 AM every day?

24:27.417 --> 24:28.834
- Fuck you.
- You know what?

24:28.834 --> 24:30.166
You've said
so many mean things to me

24:30.166 --> 24:32.333
and I can't make
one stupid salvia joke?

24:32.333 --> 24:34.041
Elijah, come on!

24:34.041 --> 24:36.625
I don't know,
I kind of thought
you'd be happy.

24:36.625 --> 24:39.250
You're not ready
for this.

24:39.250 --> 24:42.000
No, you're not ready
for this.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.708
I'm gonna say this
to your face

24:44.708 --> 24:48.083
- 'cause no one else
will have the guts to.
- Great.

24:48.083 --> 24:50.917
You're gonna be
a terrible mother.

24:56.542 --> 24:58.542
Oh, great,
you're gonna cry now?

24:59.667 --> 25:00.750
Ow!

25:04.500 --> 25:05.792
Sorry.

25:25.542 --> 25:27.917
Hermie's voice:
Mic check. One, two,
one, two, one, two.

25:27.917 --> 25:31.917
This is Hermie coming at you
from the living room of
one Sonja Ballentini.

25:31.917 --> 25:34.208
So, Sonja, how's life?

25:34.208 --> 25:38.417
Sonja's voice:
You know what?
It doesn't pay to complain.

25:38.417 --> 25:40.291
Hermie's voice:
Now, how's that, Sonja?

25:40.291 --> 25:42.333
Sonja's voice:
I learned in life

25:42.333 --> 25:45.417
that you have to
take the hard knocks
the way they are...

25:45.417 --> 25:47.625
- Sure.
- ...and learn
to live with it.

25:47.625 --> 25:51.250
And learn how to be happy
with it and without it.

25:51.250 --> 25:53.542
Don't let the garbage
get to you.

25:53.542 --> 25:55.083
( Hermie laughs )

25:55.083 --> 25:56.458
Sonja's voice:
And I get up in the morning

25:56.458 --> 25:58.041
and I say,
"What am I gonna do

25:58.041 --> 26:00.542
that's gonna
make me happy today?"

26:00.542 --> 26:02.333
I do that every morning,

26:02.333 --> 26:05.166
and I found out that
it's the best way to live

26:05.166 --> 26:06.875
because you get up
and you say,

26:06.875 --> 26:11.625
"Well, I'm gonna do this
for myself first."

26:11.625 --> 26:14.291
Okay, Mom,
you have all the symptoms
of cannabis poisoning.

26:14.291 --> 26:16.041
The good news is that,
"Marijuana by itself

26:16.041 --> 26:19.500
has never caused
an overdose death
in the United States to date."

26:19.500 --> 26:22.291
So, you're not
gonna be the first.
Can you stand up?

26:22.291 --> 26:25.166
I'm done.
My life is done.

26:25.166 --> 26:26.834
That's not true.
You're not done.

26:26.834 --> 26:28.333
I need you.
We need you.

26:28.333 --> 26:30.208
You're gonna be a grandma.
Remember, Grandma Loreen?

26:30.208 --> 26:32.291
Oh, no, that's right.
I'll be a grandma.

26:32.291 --> 26:35.667
And when you
think of grandparents,
you think of death.

26:35.667 --> 26:37.375
Nuh-uh, I don't!

26:39.375 --> 26:41.083
You're sweet.

26:41.083 --> 26:42.959
You're so sweet.
Come here.

26:44.667 --> 26:46.917
- I just want you
to know...
- Mm-hmm?

26:46.917 --> 26:49.667
...every time
I look at your baby,

26:49.667 --> 26:52.041
I will see
my own death.

26:59.333 --> 27:01.250
( coughing )

27:01.250 --> 27:03.208
Mom?

27:03.208 --> 27:05.208
- ( coughing )
- Mom.

27:23.542 --> 27:24.792
Do you mind
if I sit down?

27:24.792 --> 27:26.542
No, not at--
not at all.

27:26.542 --> 27:28.875
Thanks.
I'm just avoiding
someone up there, so.

27:31.291 --> 27:32.875
Did you
just move in, or...?

27:32.875 --> 27:35.375
No, I'm acting in a film
that they're shooting here.

27:35.375 --> 27:36.375
Oh.

27:37.708 --> 27:39.750
Would that happen to be
Adam Sackler's film?

27:39.750 --> 27:41.625
Yeah.
You know him?

27:41.625 --> 27:43.542
Like, barely.

27:43.542 --> 27:45.000
What's the role?

27:45.000 --> 27:47.041
Um, her name is Mira.

27:47.041 --> 27:48.750
She's a writer.

27:50.083 --> 27:51.417
It's actually
a really fun part.

27:51.417 --> 27:53.000
She's, like,
the love interest

27:53.000 --> 27:56.250
and she's mentally ill,
so it's fun.

27:56.250 --> 27:57.333
Great, yeah.

27:57.333 --> 27:59.750
Oh, do you want
a cigarette?

27:59.750 --> 28:01.917
Oh, no, thank you.

28:01.917 --> 28:03.917
I'm actually pregnant, so.

28:05.083 --> 28:06.708
Oh, my God.

28:06.708 --> 28:08.875
- Oh, that's so fun!
- Oh, don't worry about it.

28:08.875 --> 28:11.625
I think a certain amount
of, like, secondhand smoke
is to be expected

28:11.625 --> 28:12.875
just in city life.

28:12.875 --> 28:14.917
Is it--
is it your first?

28:14.917 --> 28:16.542
Yeah. Yeah.

28:16.542 --> 28:17.875
Do you
have kids, or...?

28:17.875 --> 28:19.250
Yeah, I have three.

28:19.250 --> 28:23.083
- Oh!
- Being pregnant
is the best.

28:23.083 --> 28:24.667
Are you loving it?

28:24.667 --> 28:26.750
No. No.

28:26.750 --> 28:29.041
Right now, I'm just
more worried about, like,
getting the baby out of me

28:29.041 --> 28:30.250
and then, like,
what I'm gonna do with it.

28:31.333 --> 28:33.417
Today was such
a fucking nightmare.

28:33.417 --> 28:35.417
I don't wanna be
responsible for anyone else
for the rest of my life.

28:35.417 --> 28:37.917
- That's insane!
- Jesus, don't worry about it.

28:37.917 --> 28:39.583
Kids are super easy.

28:42.792 --> 28:45.166
It's being an adult
that's hard.

28:53.625 --> 28:56.250
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

Not a joke. Just what's going on
in my uterus.

we went through.

30:34.542 --> 30:36.959

30:41.375 --> 30:42.166
by now.

30:42.542 --> 30:43.750
As a mother, Hannah has
to decide

30:43.750 --> 30:44.708
what's best for the baby.

30:45.166 --> 30:47.291
She doesn't know
who this guy is, what he wants.

30:47.291 --> 30:48.750
I mean, I have a pretty good
sense of who he is.

30:48.750 --> 30:50.041
He wears like
a puka shell necklace,

30:50.250 --> 30:52.708
and his days off are
Thursday and Tuesday.

30:58.083 --> 31:00.125
I wanna just, like, feel like
adults live in this place.

31:00.125 --> 31:00.917
You've gotta give your mom

31:01.458 --> 31:02.375
a little more credit than that,
okay?

31:02.583 --> 31:03.583
She's way more chill than that.

31:03.583 --> 31:04.708
We almost made out, once.

31:06.708 --> 31:08.417
This episode
is called "Gummies".

31:08.417 --> 31:09.834
It's written by Sarah Hayward,

31:10.083 --> 31:11.834
someone who's been with us
since the pilot of Girls.

31:11.834 --> 31:13.375
It is truly from her brain
and soul,

31:13.583 --> 31:15.708
and I think she was very happy
considering her obsession

31:15.708 --> 31:18.917
with gummy candy, that she
was able to write this episode.

31:19.166 --> 31:19.959
Seriously?

31:20.667 --> 31:23.250
Loreen isn't in a position
to be, like, thrilled

31:23.250 --> 31:24.500
about becoming a grandmother.

31:24.792 --> 31:26.917
She dreamed it would happen
when she and her husband

31:26.917 --> 31:27.917
were in their dotage,

31:28.291 --> 31:29.625
and her daughter had
a successful career.

31:29.625 --> 31:31.166
It's the bittersweetness
of sort of,

31:31.166 --> 31:33.041
getting a version of
what you want,

31:33.041 --> 31:34.500
but not what you want.

31:36.667 --> 31:39.583
It's in the consciousness
of sexually active women.

31:39.583 --> 31:41.375
From the minute they start
having sex,

31:41.375 --> 31:43.959
a huge part of what they
understand could happen,

31:44.125 --> 31:45.083
is that they could get pregnant,

31:45.792 --> 31:47.542
and they would have to deal with
the consequences of that.

31:47.542 --> 31:49.834
No man knows what it's like
to go out, and every time

31:49.834 --> 31:52.041
you're doing something that's
sort of recreational,

31:52.041 --> 31:53.458
you're risking pregnancy.

31:53.625 --> 31:55.333
All my friends and I, would
always have conversations

31:55.333 --> 31:56.208
in our 20's of like,

31:56.792 --> 31:57.959
"what would you do
if you got pregnant."

31:59.250 --> 32:01.333
LENA: Hannah was a little bit
struck by lightning,

32:01.333 --> 32:02.750
like, she finds out
she's pregnant,

32:02.750 --> 32:04.458
and much to her own surprise,

32:04.458 --> 32:07.208
realizes that being a mother
is something that she wants.

32:07.208 --> 32:10.500
And she recognizes all the ways
that the odds are stacked

32:10.500 --> 32:11.333
against her.

32:11.959 --> 32:14.542
And still makes this decision,
and that felt like

32:14.542 --> 32:17.875
a cool alternative way
of depicting

32:17.875 --> 32:20.125
what an unplanned pregnancy
can look like.

32:21.166 --> 32:22.667
(LAUGHING)

32:22.667 --> 32:25.500
LENA: Elijah's been on
a Adderall bender,

32:25.500 --> 32:26.667
gone on a Google deep-dive,

32:27.083 --> 32:29.166
and is acting as though his
debaucherous lifestyle

32:29.166 --> 32:30.917
is fun for him, and this is
sort of the moment,

32:30.917 --> 32:33.208
in this episode, where he has
to realize that he does,

32:33.208 --> 32:34.500
in fact, feel left behind.

32:34.834 --> 32:36.500
JENNI: And when he
finds out Hannah's pregnant,

32:36.500 --> 32:38.500
that's the ultimate betrayal
to him.

32:38.500 --> 32:40.083
He feels like Hannah was
his partner in crime,

32:40.083 --> 32:42.792
and now she's not going to be
able to be anymore.

32:42.792 --> 32:45.625
We had a really special,
specific thing!

32:45.625 --> 32:48.959
And you just decided to go
and ruin it with some baby!

32:48.959 --> 32:51.417
In Andrew's performance,
you really saw the hurt.

32:51.417 --> 32:54.542
He just wants to show her
how much pain he's in.

32:54.542 --> 32:56.375
You're gonna be
a terrible mother.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.375
Our casting director,
Jen Euston,

33:00.583 --> 33:02.083
she sent us a bunch
of auditions, and she said,

33:02.083 --> 33:03.625
"you're going to cast
Daisy Eagan."

33:03.875 --> 33:05.708
She was like, "she gets asked
if she's you in the street,

33:05.708 --> 33:06.375
all the time.

33:07.041 --> 33:08.458
She's an amazing actor,
youngest woman ever

33:08.458 --> 33:09.333
to win the Tony,

33:09.792 --> 33:12.041
and she's funny,
and is willing to go there."

33:12.041 --> 33:13.750
And she was, it was amazing.

33:14.250 --> 33:16.125
They did a great job of
dressing her

33:16.125 --> 33:17.917
like a version of
first-season Hannah,

33:17.917 --> 33:19.708
so she was like,
ghost of Hannah-past.

33:19.708 --> 33:20.708
-Yeah.
-It's funny,

33:21.208 --> 33:23.041
every season when I put
my Hannah clothes back on,

33:23.041 --> 33:24.083
I'm like, "well, she's back."

33:24.500 --> 33:26.041
Like, there's a thing she does
with her body,

33:26.041 --> 33:28.708
and with her voice,
that's very specific.

33:28.708 --> 33:30.583
Even if it vaguely resembles me.

33:31.083 --> 33:34.083
It's actually a really fun part,
she's like a love interest,

33:34.417 --> 33:35.750
and she's mentally ill.

33:35.750 --> 33:38.291
-So it's fun.
-Great, yeah.

33:38.291 --> 33:39.625
And the idea, that like,

33:40.000 --> 33:41.583
at the end of the episode
Hannah would have to sit down,

33:41.583 --> 33:44.750
and meet face-to-face,
somebody else's concept

33:44.750 --> 33:46.417
-of who you are.
-Oh.

33:47.333 --> 33:48.959
What a confusing moment.

33:49.291 --> 33:51.500
And at the end of the episode,
Hannah finds herself

33:51.500 --> 33:55.000
very alone. But, she's also
still able to feel confident

33:55.000 --> 33:55.875
in her choices.

33:56.500 --> 33:57.625
It's one of the moments its
been fun to play her,

33:58.166 --> 33:59.458
'cause I think she's actually
being very brave.

33:59.959 --> 34:01.750
She's like, "I know what I want,
and I know how I'm gonna do it,

34:01.750 --> 34:03.750
and I actually don't need
the approval of everybody

34:03.750 --> 34:06.208
around me, 'cause I'm going
to figure this out."

34:06.667 --> 34:07.917
This is my baby.

34:10.250 --> 34:11.291
Wow.
