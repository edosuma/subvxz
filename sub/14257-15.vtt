01:09.241 --> 01:12.782
WITHIN MINUTES
EARTH'S BAKERIES
WILL BE WIPED OUT.

01:12.783 --> 01:15.590
NOT A SINGLE CHEESE DANISH
WILL REMAIN.

01:15.591 --> 01:19.300
THEY'LL ALL BE OURS!
[CHUCKLES]

01:19.301 --> 01:21.038
CHEESE DANISH?

01:21.039 --> 01:24.982
WE ARE 1,000 MILES
BELOW THE SURFACE
OF THE EARTH.

01:24.983 --> 01:27.556
DO YOU REALIZE
HOW HARD IT IS

01:27.557 --> 01:29.428
TO GET A DECENT
SNACK DOWN HERE?

01:33.172 --> 01:35.477
NOT SO FAST, SHREDDER.

01:35.478 --> 01:37.482
YEAH, THERE ARE
PEOPLE UP THERE

01:37.483 --> 01:39.522
WHO NEED THOSE
CHEESE DANISHES.

01:39.523 --> 01:43.198
THE TEENAGE MUTANT
NINJA WIMPS.

01:43.199 --> 01:44.869
LET'S TAKE THEM!

01:44.870 --> 01:47.376
LIKE, WHAT'S
THE PLAN, LEONARDO?

01:47.377 --> 01:50.885
WELL, WE COULD
CUT TO THE LEFT,

01:50.886 --> 01:53.393
OR MAYBE TO THE RIGHT.

01:53.394 --> 01:55.131
I CAN'T DECIDE.

01:55.132 --> 01:57.136
THANKS. YOU'VE BEEN
A HUGE HELP.

01:57.137 --> 01:58.807
COME ON, DONATELLO.

01:58.808 --> 02:00.813
ALL RIGHT, BE BOP,

02:00.814 --> 02:03.019
IT'S TIME TO TANGLE
WITH TURTLES.

02:03.020 --> 02:06.228
INTERRUPT MY DINNER,
WILL YOU?

02:08.502 --> 02:10.774
NOW I KNOW HOW
A MEATBALL FEELS.

02:10.775 --> 02:13.280
SAY YOUR PRAYERS,
HOG BREATH.

02:14.284 --> 02:17.658
DO ME A FAVOR
AND BLOW.

02:20.434 --> 02:22.372
FANTABULOSO!

02:22.373 --> 02:24.678
A MONSTER KILLER PIZZA!

02:27.386 --> 02:30.059
HOLD THE ANCHOVIES!

02:30.060 --> 02:32.766
THERE'S ONLY YOU NOW,
LEONARDO.

02:32.767 --> 02:34.037
GET HIM!

02:41.090 --> 02:42.259
YEOW!

02:43.262 --> 02:45.400
SET LOOSE
THE VICIOUS DOGS.

02:53.122 --> 02:56.129
WELL, LEONARDO,
WHAT A DISASTROUS LEADER

02:56.130 --> 02:58.169
YOU TURNED OUT TO BE.

03:00.041 --> 03:01.878
YOU'RE IN THE SOUP NOW--

03:01.879 --> 03:04.051
TURTLE SOUP, THAT IS.

03:08.398 --> 03:12.273
OH! WHAT A NIGHTMARE.

03:12.274 --> 03:14.313
WHAT COULD IT MEAN?

03:14.314 --> 03:17.254
IS IT SOME SORT OF OMEN?

03:17.255 --> 03:19.594
I JUST NEED SOMEONE
TO PRACTICE WITH.

03:19.595 --> 03:21.164
WHAT'S WRONG, LEONARDO?

03:21.165 --> 03:25.343
OH, IT'S THAT DREAM.
I FEEL IT WAS A WARNING

03:25.344 --> 03:28.016
THAT MY JUDGMENT IS
BEGINNING TO FAIL.

03:28.017 --> 03:31.024
YOU'LL BE JUST FINE.
NOW COME ON.

03:31.025 --> 03:32.094
HAIEE!

03:34.501 --> 03:37.275
THAT'S IT.
NOW YOU ATTACK ME.

03:38.713 --> 03:39.714
YEOW!

03:39.715 --> 03:41.052
OOH!

03:42.055 --> 03:44.561
AW, YOU SEE?
IT'S HAPPENING.

03:44.562 --> 03:46.566
MY INSTINCTS ARE SHOT.

03:46.567 --> 03:48.572
MY JUDGMENT IS GONE.

03:48.573 --> 03:52.684
OH, I'M NO LONGER
FIT TO LEAD ANYONE.

03:52.685 --> 03:55.357
HEY, LIGHTEN UP, DUDE.

03:55.358 --> 03:57.898
EVERYBODY GOOFS UP
ONCE IN A WHILE.

03:57.899 --> 03:58.967
AFTER ALL,

03:58.968 --> 04:00.438
TURTLES ARE ONLY HUMAN.

04:00.439 --> 04:04.716
FORGET IT. GUYS. I'LL ONLY
GET YOU INTO TROUBLE.

04:04.717 --> 04:06.722
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT,

04:06.723 --> 04:10.398
AND I MUST LEAVE.

04:10.399 --> 04:14.409
MASTER SPLINTER,
YOU'VE GOT TO TALK
LEONARDO OUT OF LEAVING.

04:14.410 --> 04:17.082
THERE'S AN ANCIENT
JAPANESE SAYING,

04:17.083 --> 04:18.320
"HE WHO WOULD BE
A BOULDER

04:18.321 --> 04:22.096
ON THE PATH OF LIFE
MUST FIRST BE A PEBBLE."

04:22.096 --> 04:24.102
I DON'T GET IT.

04:24.103 --> 04:27.110
PERHAPS IT LOSES SOMETHING
IN TRANSLATION.

04:33.161 --> 04:34.998
THAT'S FAR ENOUGH.

04:34.999 --> 04:37.672
YOU WILL SEE THAT
NO ONE IN UNIFORM

04:37.673 --> 04:41.015
AND DEFINITELY
NO TURTLES ENTER
THE BUILDING.

04:41.016 --> 04:43.956
NOBODY IN UNIFORM.
NO TURTLES.

04:43.957 --> 04:45.359
INSTRUCTIONS ASSIMILATED.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.699
THIS HAD BETTER WORK,
SHREDDER!

04:47.700 --> 04:49.370
TRUST ME, KRANG.

04:49.371 --> 04:50.874
IT CANNOT FAIL.

04:51.878 --> 04:54.384
THERE IT IS,
THE MILE HIGH TOWERS.

04:54.385 --> 04:56.122
I WONDER WHAT'S UP?

04:56.123 --> 04:59.832
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBOT
BARRICADING THE ENTRANCE.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.537
THERE'S
THE ROBOT NOW!

05:01.538 --> 05:04.712
UNIFORMS! UNIFORMS!
ENTRANCE DENIED.

05:09.627 --> 05:11.597
YAA!

05:12.601 --> 05:14.438
OH! OOH!

05:16.646 --> 05:18.316
WHOA!

05:18.317 --> 05:20.789
AND WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED
FROM THIS LESSON?

05:20.790 --> 05:23.830
NEVER MESS
WITH A ROBOT.

05:25.001 --> 05:28.443
WHAT'S TAKING
SO LONG, SHREDDER?

05:28.444 --> 05:31.484
PATIENCE, KRANG.
IN A SHORT TIME,

05:31.485 --> 05:34.459
THE CITIZENS WILL BE
TOO COLD TO RESIST US.

05:34.460 --> 05:37.067
THE SOLAR SIPHON
WILL SOON DRAIN

05:37.068 --> 05:38.537
ALL THE ENERGY
FROM THE SUN,

05:38.538 --> 05:41.378
AND STORE IT IN THESE
SOLAR BATTERIES,

05:41.379 --> 05:45.422
WHILE THE ENTIRE
PLANET IS TURNED
INTO A DEEP FREEZE

05:45.423 --> 05:46.893
THAT WILL MAKE
THE ICE AGE

05:46.894 --> 05:50.068
SEEM LIKE
A TURKISH BATH!

05:50.069 --> 05:53.244
WHOO, YOU HAVE
A WAY WITH WORDS,
SHREDDER!

05:53.245 --> 05:56.084
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE A WRITER.

05:56.085 --> 05:59.594
BEING A RUTHLESS
CONQUEROR WAS
MY SECOND CHOICE.

05:59.595 --> 06:02.101
WHERE COULD
LEONARDO HAVE
GONE TO?

06:02.102 --> 06:04.976
THE DUDE'S ACTING
MONDO BIZARRO.

06:04.977 --> 06:07.148
WE NEVER SHOULD'VE
LET HIM GO.

06:07.149 --> 06:10.524
BRR! IT IS RIGHTEOUSLY COLD.

06:10.525 --> 06:13.198
I CAN'T BELIVE
IT'S THE MIDDLE
OF JULY.

06:13.199 --> 06:15.203
SCOPE THAT OUT, DUDES.

06:15.204 --> 06:17.109
IS MY EYESIGHT
GOING,

06:17.110 --> 06:20.050
OR IS THE SUN
ACTUALLY GETTING
SMALLER?

06:20.051 --> 06:22.255
IT'S SCIENTIFICALLY
IMPOSSIBLE.

06:22.256 --> 06:23.593
NOW COME ON.

06:23.594 --> 06:26.066
LET'S KEEP LOOKING
FOR LEONARDO.

06:27.070 --> 06:29.108
THIS IS TOTALLY NUTSOID.

06:29.109 --> 06:30.946
NOW IT'S SNOWING.

06:30.947 --> 06:32.450
I'VE GOT A FEELING
OUR OLD FRIEND

06:32.451 --> 06:34.355
SHREDDER'S
BEHIND THIS.

06:34.356 --> 06:36.060
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

06:36.061 --> 06:38.199
WELL,
ISN'T HE ALWAYS?

06:38.200 --> 06:41.709
YOU HAVE TO TELL US
WHAT TO DO, MASTER!

06:41.710 --> 06:43.246
LEONARDO'S GONE.

06:43.247 --> 06:44.750
AND THERE SEEMS
TO BE SOMETHING

06:44.751 --> 06:46.923
RADICALLY WRONG
WITH THE SUN.

06:46.924 --> 06:49.931
THIS IS A LIFE
EXPERIENCE, MY STUDENTS.

06:49.932 --> 06:52.337
EACH OF YOU
MUST LEARN FROM IT.

06:52.338 --> 06:54.610
SO, LIKE,
WHO'S GONNA
BE THE LEADER?

06:54.611 --> 06:56.348
MAYBE WE COULD
FLIP FOR IT.

06:56.349 --> 06:59.022
BETTER YET, WE'LL PLAY
SPIN THE PIZZA.

06:59.023 --> 07:02.999
ALL RIGHT, MONDO NOTION!

07:03.000 --> 07:04.504
HERE GOES.

07:06.410 --> 07:08.983
LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE IT, RAPHAEL.

07:08.984 --> 07:11.155
HOW ABOUT
TWO OUT OF THREE?

07:11.156 --> 07:14.731
OH, NO WAY, DUDE.
YOU'RE THE BIG CHEESE NOW.

07:14.732 --> 07:17.339
TELL US, FEARLESS LEADER.
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

07:17.340 --> 07:20.815
UH, I DON'T KNOW.
GO UP TOP AND
LOOK AROUND?

07:20.816 --> 07:24.324
SEE? THAT WASN'T
SO HARD, WAS IT?

07:24.325 --> 07:26.029
ARGH! IT'S STUCK.

07:26.030 --> 07:27.499
ALLOW ME.

07:32.714 --> 07:35.187
WHAT NOW,
LEADER DUDE?

07:35.188 --> 07:38.697
WHEN IN DOUBT,
CLIMB ON OUT.

07:39.700 --> 07:42.173
WHOA, DIG ALL THIS SNOW.

07:42.174 --> 07:44.479
LET'S HOPE
WE DON'T HAVE TO.

07:44.480 --> 07:47.186
IT'S LOOKS EXACTLY
LIKE THE NORTH POLE.

07:47.187 --> 07:50.294
YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT
BECAUSE OF THE POLAR BEAR.

07:50.295 --> 07:52.267
POLAR BEAR?
POLAR BEAR?
POLAR BEAR?

07:54.474 --> 07:55.977
NICE LEADING, LEADER.

07:55.978 --> 08:00.489
GUYS, I DON'T THINK
I WANT TO BE
LEADER ANYMORE.

08:04.869 --> 08:06.706
YOUR FORMER LEADER
SAYS...

08:06.707 --> 08:08.611
RUN!

08:10.550 --> 08:13.759
OH, NO, YOU CAN'T
RESIGN THAT EASILY.

08:17.569 --> 08:20.944
WHOA!
AAH!
WHOA!

08:21.948 --> 08:23.752
AAH!
AAH!

08:23.753 --> 08:27.997
COWABUNGA!

08:27.998 --> 08:31.173
WHOA!

08:31.174 --> 08:32.844
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.

08:32.845 --> 08:35.751
IT'S LIKE WE REALLY
ARE IN THE ARCTIC.

08:40.866 --> 08:43.205
I, UH, NEVER FOUGHT
A POLAR BEAR BEFORE.

08:43.206 --> 08:44.476
WHAT DO I DO?

08:44.477 --> 08:46.714
HEY, WHY ARE YOU
ASKING ME? YOU'RE
THE LEADER.

08:55.205 --> 08:57.209
HEY, LOOKIE,
POLAR DUDE,

08:57.210 --> 08:59.249
A TROUTSICLE.

09:01.890 --> 09:06.034
COME ON, AMIGOS,
LET'S MAKE
TURTLE TRACKS.

09:09.745 --> 09:13.220
I TOLD YOU THIS WASN'T
THE ARCTIC. LOOK.

09:19.137 --> 09:22.947
RAPHEAL, YOU BROUGHT US
UP RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE ZOO.

09:22.948 --> 09:24.617
WELL, IT'S FREE,
ISN'T IT?

09:24.618 --> 09:27.258
CHILL, DUDES.
WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT

09:27.259 --> 09:28.796
WHAT'S MAKING
THE SUN SHRINK.

09:28.797 --> 09:32.239
SOMETHING IS DRAINING
ITS SOLAR ENERGY
AND ITS SUBSTANCE.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.909
GREAT. NOW WHAT
DO WE DO?

09:33.910 --> 09:37.085
SIMPLE. WE USE THIS
ENERGY TRACKER I INVENTED

09:37.086 --> 09:39.391
TO LEAD US TO THE SOURCE
OF THE SOLAR DRAIN.

09:39.392 --> 09:42.098
THAT DOES IT.
YOU HAVE ALL
THE ANSWERS.

09:42.099 --> 09:43.402
YOU BE THE LEADER.

09:43.403 --> 09:45.607
ALL RIGHT.

09:47.146 --> 09:50.989
NOW, THE SOURCES
OF THE SOLAR DRAIN
IS DUE EAST OF HERE.

09:50.990 --> 09:52.493
WELL, LET'S BOOGIE.

09:52.494 --> 09:54.666
HEY, LET'S NOT RUSH
INTO THIS, GENTLEMEN.

09:54.667 --> 09:57.573
FIRST, WE HAVE TO CALCULATE
THE VECTOR COORDINATES

09:57.574 --> 09:59.680
IN ORDER TO TRIANGULATE
THE CORRECT ROUTE.

09:59.681 --> 10:02.520
YOU SAID IT'S EAST,
SO LET'S GO EAST!

10:02.521 --> 10:05.862
LOOK, I'M THE LEADER AND
WE'RE GONNA DO IT MY WAY.

10:05.863 --> 10:09.873
WHY DO I GET
THE FEELING THAT I
MADE A BIG MISTAKE?

10:09.874 --> 10:13.884
IRMA, I T-TOLD YOU
TO TURN UP THE H-HEAT.

10:13.885 --> 10:17.461
WHAT H-HEAT? THERE'S
ICE IN THE FURNACE.

10:17.462 --> 10:19.467
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THIS FREAK WEATHER?

10:19.468 --> 10:22.408
AND WHY ISN'T ANYONE
COVERING THIS STORY?

10:22.409 --> 10:26.151
BECAUSE WE'RE
ALL T-T-TOO BUSY
COVERING OURSELVES.

10:26.152 --> 10:29.292
APRIL, G-GET IN HERE.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.435
YES, MR. THOMPSON?

10:32.436 --> 10:35.510
I WANT YOU TO GET HOT
ON THIS COLD STORY.

10:35.511 --> 10:36.981
NO CAN DO, BOSS.

10:36.982 --> 10:39.788
THE CITY'S UNDER
6 FEET OF SNOW.

10:39.789 --> 10:42.495
AND WE CAN'T EVEN GET
THE FRONT DOORS OPEN!

10:42.496 --> 10:45.002
BUT WE CAN'T
JUST SIT HERE.

10:45.003 --> 10:47.375
WE'VE GOT
TO DO SOMETHING.

10:47.376 --> 10:49.581
I'D CALL THE TURTLES,

10:49.582 --> 10:51.754
BUT MY TURTLECOM'S FROZEN.

10:53.861 --> 10:56.065
THE WEATHER'S
TURNING COLDER.

10:56.066 --> 10:59.374
I SHOULD'VE PICKED
A WARMER DISGUISE,

10:59.375 --> 11:03.185
BUT IT'S JUST LIKE ME
TO MAKE THE WRONG DECISION.

11:03.186 --> 11:05.892
OH, I HOPE THE OTHERS
ARE DOING OK.

11:05.893 --> 11:07.263
WHAT AM I SAYING?

11:07.264 --> 11:09.769
WITHOUT ME
HOLDING THEM BACK,

11:09.770 --> 11:13.780
I'LL BET THEY'RE
RIGHT ON TOP OF THINGS.

11:16.789 --> 11:21.100
I GUESS YOU REALIZE
THIS MEANS WAR.

11:22.104 --> 11:24.977
OH, YEAH? I'LL ROLL OVER YOU

11:24.978 --> 11:28.387
LIKE A PIZZA CUTTER
THROUGH HOT MOZZARELLA, DUDE!

11:29.658 --> 11:31.663
IF THE ANGLE
OF REFRACTION

11:31.664 --> 11:34.169
EQUALS COSINE OF
THE CUBE ROOT...

11:34.170 --> 11:36.174
OH, YEAH? TAKE THAT.

11:36.175 --> 11:39.317
OH, SURE.
IF YOU'LL TAKE THESE.

11:39.318 --> 11:42.325
AND BISECT THE HYPOTENUSE'S
OBTUSE ANGLE...

11:42.326 --> 11:44.598
DONATELLO, WHILE
YOU'RE DOODLING,

11:44.599 --> 11:46.336
THE ENTIRE PLANET
IS TURNING INTO

11:46.337 --> 11:49.878
A GIANT SNOW CONE.
EAST IS THAT WAY.

11:49.879 --> 11:51.883
THEN CALCULATE
THE DENOMINATOR.

11:51.884 --> 11:53.388
I'VE GOT IT!

11:53.389 --> 11:55.326
EAST IS THAT WAY.

11:55.327 --> 11:57.098
OH!

11:59.572 --> 12:03.014
THE SOLAR BATTERIES
ARE NEARLY FULL,

12:03.015 --> 12:05.955
WHILE THE SUN
IS DRAINING RAPIDLY.

12:05.956 --> 12:09.666
EXCELLENT! SOON EVERY
LIVING BEING ON THIS PLANET

12:09.667 --> 12:11.270
WILL BE CRYOGENICALLY
FROZEN.

12:11.271 --> 12:13.442
WE'LL THAW THEM OUT
AS WE NEED THEM.

12:13.443 --> 12:16.885
EVERYONE ON EARTH
WILL BE OUR WILLING SLAVES.

12:16.886 --> 12:19.391
DID YOU HEAR THAT,
BEBOP?

12:19.392 --> 12:21.899
WE GET
OUR OWN SLAVES.

12:21.900 --> 12:26.310
YEAH, A COUPLE
OF STUPID WIMPS
WE CAN PUSH AROUND.

12:26.311 --> 12:29.319
ROCK STEADY, BEBOP,
GET OVER HERE.

12:29.320 --> 12:32.761
HEY, WE AIN'T
YOUR SLAVES,
YOU KNOW.

12:32.762 --> 12:34.499
OH, YOU'RE NOT, HUH?

12:34.500 --> 12:37.508
YII! NO FAIR!
YII! NO FAIR!

12:37.509 --> 12:40.014
WHERE'S THAT
ABE LINCOLN GUY

12:40.015 --> 12:42.019
WHEN YOU
NEED HIM?

12:44.528 --> 12:47.300
AHA! THIS IS THE PLACE.

12:47.301 --> 12:48.805
YOU'RE KIDDING,
RIGHT?

12:48.806 --> 12:50.978
DONATELLO,
THAT'S A SCHOOLHOUSE.

12:50.979 --> 12:53.551
YOU CAN'T ARGUE
WITH SCIENTIFIC DATA.

12:53.552 --> 12:55.356
OK, YOU'RE THE LEADER.

13:01.674 --> 13:04.079
HOLY GUACAMOLE!

13:04.080 --> 13:07.422
NOW THIS IS
WHAT I'D CALL
A COOL SCHOOL!

13:07.423 --> 13:11.232
COME ON, WE'VE GOT TO
FIND THAT SOLAR DRAIN.

13:14.275 --> 13:17.583
UH-OH! SOUNDS
LIKE TROUBLE
IN SHIVER CITY.

13:21.963 --> 13:25.338
OH, GREAT. NOW WE'RE
TRAPPED IN HERE.

13:25.339 --> 13:27.076
WHOA, HOW WEIRD!

13:27.077 --> 13:29.147
WE'RE BEING KEPT IN
AFTER SCHOOL

13:29.148 --> 13:30.852
AND WITHOUT
A TEACHER.

13:30.853 --> 13:32.657
NO PROBLEM, GUYS.

13:32.658 --> 13:34.495
ONCE WE PUT THAT
SOLAR DEVICE OUT
OF COMMISSION,

13:34.496 --> 13:36.735
ALL THE SNOW WILL THAW.

13:39.277 --> 13:41.214
ACCORDING TO
THE ENERGY TRACKER,

13:41.215 --> 13:43.720
IT'S UP IN
THE BELL TOWER.

13:48.869 --> 13:50.204
WHOA!
WHOA!

13:50.205 --> 13:55.218
AAH!
LOOK OUT!
WHOA!

13:55.219 --> 13:58.226
NOW I KNOW WHY
THEY CALL IT BREAKDANCING.

13:58.227 --> 13:59.998
I THINK I BROKE SOMETHING.

13:59.999 --> 14:03.507
FELLAS, WE'RE GOING TO NEED
OUR NINJA CLIMBING GEAR.

14:03.508 --> 14:06.215
THESE FOOT CLEATS
SURE COME IN HANDY.

14:08.254 --> 14:11.195
YEAH, EVEN THOUGH WE HAD
TO LOOK ALL OVER TOWN

14:11.196 --> 14:12.532
FOR TURTLE WIDTHS.

14:12.533 --> 14:15.306
[BEEPING]

14:15.307 --> 14:16.844
WE FOUND IT.

14:19.218 --> 14:21.723
THAT'S WHAT'S
SHRINKING THE SUN?

14:21.724 --> 14:26.236
UH, NO, ACTUALLY IT'S
SOMETHING THAT'S DESIGNED
TO TRICK MY ENERGY TRACKER

14:26.237 --> 14:29.244
INTO THINKING IT'S WHAT'S
SHRINKING THE SUN.

14:29.245 --> 14:31.250
IN OTHER WORDS,
WE'VE BEEN SNOOKERED.

14:31.251 --> 14:32.854
WELL, THAT'S NOT ALL.

14:32.855 --> 14:34.859
BESIDES BEING
A TRANSMITTER,

14:34.860 --> 14:36.698
IT'S ALSO A BOMB.

14:36.699 --> 14:38.369
STUPID QUESTION TIME--

14:38.370 --> 14:39.940
WHEN DOES THE BOMB
GO OFF?

14:39.941 --> 14:43.383
EXACTLY 10 SECONDS FROM NOW!

14:45.422 --> 14:48.396
THIS THING IS GONNA
EXPLODE IN 10 SECONDS!

14:48.397 --> 14:51.070
SOME LEADER YOU
TURNED OUT TO BE!

14:51.071 --> 14:52.975
LEADING US RIGHT
INTO A TRAP.

14:52.976 --> 14:56.651
MICHELANGELO,
CUT THAT BELL DOWN.

14:56.652 --> 14:58.724
WAY AHEAD OF YOU, BUD!

15:02.135 --> 15:05.308
BOMBS AWAY!

15:12.797 --> 15:15.804
WHOA!
AAH!
LOOK OUT BELOW!

15:15.805 --> 15:17.308
COMING IN!

15:17.309 --> 15:20.550
WELL, DUDES,
I'D SAY SCHOOL'S OUT.

15:22.757 --> 15:24.862
DID I MISS DAYLIGHT
SAVINGS TIME?

15:24.863 --> 15:26.500
ISN'T IT GETTING DARK
KIND OF EARLY?

15:26.501 --> 15:28.672
DEFINITELY BIZARRO.

15:28.673 --> 15:30.678
ACCORDING TO THAT
BIG OFFICE CLOCK,

15:30.679 --> 15:33.686
IT'S ONLY 3:00
IN THE AFTERNOON.

15:33.687 --> 15:35.524
LOOK, THE SUN HAS
SHRUNK SO MUCH,

15:35.525 --> 15:37.563
IT'S THE SAME SIZE
AS THE OTHER STARS.

15:37.564 --> 15:39.735
SWELL. NOW W

15:39.736 --> 15:41.006
UH, NO PROBLEM.

15:41.007 --> 15:43.011
MY ENERGY TRACKER
SHOULD LEAD US

15:43.012 --> 15:44.414
STRAIGHT TO
THE DRAINING
DEVICE...

15:44.415 --> 15:46.420
WELL, THAT IS,
IT WOULD HAVE,

15:46.421 --> 15:47.590
IF IT HADN'T
BEEN DAMAGED.

15:47.591 --> 15:50.598
BUT DON'T WORRY.
I'VE GOT A SPARE.

15:50.599 --> 15:52.103
HEY, WHERE IS YOUR SPARE?

15:52.104 --> 15:54.944
BACK AT THE LAIR.
WHERE ELSE?

15:54.945 --> 15:59.455
I HATE TO SAY THIS,
BUT I GUESS THIS MAKES
YOU THE LEADER NOW.

15:59.456 --> 16:04.369
ALL RIGHT! I
ALWAYS WANTED TO BE
THE BIG KAHUNA.

16:04.370 --> 16:07.477
UH... WHAT DO
YOU THINK WE
OUGHT TO DO?

16:07.478 --> 16:09.984
HOW DID I KNOW HE WAS
GONNA SAY THAT?

16:13.328 --> 16:15.566
DON'T GO NEAR
THE BRIDGE, SONNY!

16:15.567 --> 16:18.909
THE SNOW'S
GOT IT OVERWEIGHTED.

16:18.910 --> 16:20.914
SEE WHAT I MEAN?

16:20.915 --> 16:22.084
WOW.

16:22.085 --> 16:24.590
EVERYBODY TALKS
ABOUT THE WEATHER,

16:24.591 --> 16:27.531
BUT NOBODY'S DOING
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

16:27.532 --> 16:30.774
HE'S RIGHT. THE WHOLE
WORLD'S IN DANGER.

16:30.775 --> 16:33.448
AND ALL I'VE THOUGHT
ABOUT IS MYSELF.

16:33.449 --> 16:37.025
WELL, I'M GOING BACK.

16:37.026 --> 16:41.069
OOH! OOH!
WE'RE ALL GOING
TO FREEZE TO DEATH.

16:41.070 --> 16:43.007
I JUST KNOW IT.

16:43.008 --> 16:45.915
NOW WE WON'T, IRMA.
IF I CAN BUILD A FIRE,

16:45.916 --> 16:48.589
WE CAN DEFROST
MY TURTLECOM
AND GET HELP!

16:48.590 --> 16:50.661
THERE. IT'S BURNING.

16:50.662 --> 16:52.599
QUICK, IRMA, THROW SOME
FUEL ON IT!

16:52.600 --> 16:54.137
HERE, USE THIS.

16:59.186 --> 17:01.691
I DIDN'T MEAN
THE TURTLECOM.

17:01.692 --> 17:02.928
OOPS.

17:02.929 --> 17:06.805
UH, RAPHAEL,
I THINK WE'RE LOST.

17:06.806 --> 17:10.115
YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW
WHERE WE ARE.

17:10.116 --> 17:13.522
FACE IT. WE'RE NEVER
GOING TO FIND LEONARDO.

17:13.523 --> 17:17.467
OR THIS MYSTERIOUS DEVICE
THAT'S DRAINING
THE SUN'S ENERGY.

17:17.468 --> 17:20.075
OH, THAT PART'S CINCHY.
IT'S RIGHT THERE.

17:20.076 --> 17:22.213
IT'S THE MILE HIGH
TOWERS!

17:22.214 --> 17:24.820
MICHELANGELO,
YOU FOUND IT.

17:24.821 --> 17:28.329
HEY, LIKE, THAT'S WHY
I'M THE LEADER.

17:28.330 --> 17:31.673
THE GIZMO MUST
BE RIGHT UP THERE.

17:31.674 --> 17:34.180
OK, NOW, LET ME DO
THE TALKING, ALL RIGHT?

17:34.181 --> 17:35.817
REMEMBER,
I'M THE LEADER.

17:40.363 --> 17:42.235
HIT THE SLUSH!

17:43.773 --> 17:46.279
IT'S SOME LITTLE
ROBOT DUDE.

17:46.280 --> 17:49.454
TURTLES! TURTLES!
YOU WILL NOT PASS.

17:49.455 --> 17:52.362
WELL, LEADER,
WHAT'S THE STRATEGY NOW?

17:52.363 --> 17:53.866
OH, SIMPLE.

17:53.867 --> 17:55.170
WE SURROUND
THE ENEMY DUDE

17:55.171 --> 17:56.841
WITH A TWO-PRONGED
ATTACK.

17:56.842 --> 17:59.081
I SAW IT IN
A MOVIE ONCE.

17:59.082 --> 18:01.286
I CAN'T ARGUE WITH
LOGIC LIKE THAT.

18:04.663 --> 18:09.609
UH-OH. WHO PROGRAMMED
THIS ROBOT, KING KONG?

18:11.482 --> 18:14.121
AAH!

18:15.225 --> 18:17.865
OH, HOSTILE LITTLE GUY.

18:24.583 --> 18:28.728
LEONARDO!
GREAT TIMING, COMPADRE.

18:28.729 --> 18:30.666
I KNEW
YOU GUYS WOULD

18:30.667 --> 18:33.273
GET INTO TROUBLE
WITHOUT ME.

18:33.274 --> 18:36.549
YOU COULDN'T LET A GUY
DOWN EASY, COULD YOU?

18:36.550 --> 18:38.955
HI, GUYS.
SORRY I'M LATE.

18:38.956 --> 18:40.460
ALL RIGHT!

18:40.461 --> 18:42.833
DONATELLO'S BACK, TOO.

18:42.834 --> 18:46.476
THE AWESOME FOURSOME
TOGETHER AGAIN.

18:46.477 --> 18:48.381
HOW DID YOU FIND US, DUDE?

18:48.382 --> 18:50.820
OH, SIMPLE.
I DETERMINED
THE COEFFICIENT

18:50.821 --> 18:52.125
OF ENERGY MEASURED
IN ERGS,

18:52.126 --> 18:56.169
I TRIANGULATED
THE APPROXIMATE
LOCATION,

18:56.170 --> 18:58.876
AND THEN I LOOKED
UP AND SAW
THE FIREWORKS.

18:58.877 --> 19:01.350
ALL THIS CHIT-CHAT
IS REALLY KEEN,

19:01.351 --> 19:02.620
BUT IF WE DON'T
GET UP THERE QUICK,

19:02.621 --> 19:04.558
THIS IS GONNA TURN INTO
A 2-PART EPISODE!

19:04.559 --> 19:07.466
LET'S GO, TURTLES.

19:09.506 --> 19:11.410
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

19:11.411 --> 19:12.914
IT'S FROZEN SOLID.

19:12.915 --> 19:16.089
WE'LL NEVER GET TO
THE ROOF ON THAT STAIRCASE.

19:19.265 --> 19:22.707
FORGET IT.
THE ELEVATOR'S
FROZEN SOLID.

19:22.708 --> 19:25.415
THAT'S NEVER
STOPPED US
TURTLES BEFORE.

19:27.989 --> 19:29.659
IN A MATTER
OF MINUTES,

19:29.660 --> 19:32.066
THE SOLAR BATTERIES
WILL BE FULL,

19:32.067 --> 19:34.573
AND WE WILL BE
ABSOLUTE RULERS
OF THE EARTH!

19:34.574 --> 19:37.815
YOU WANT TO DOUBLE-CHECK
THAT TIMETABLE?

19:37.816 --> 19:39.151
THE TURTLES!

19:39.152 --> 19:40.656
TIME TO BOOGIE,
DUDES!

19:40.657 --> 19:41.959
GET THEM!

19:41.960 --> 19:44.767
EASIER SAID THAN DONE,
LEADHEAD.

19:44.768 --> 19:46.338
AAH!
AAH!

19:46.339 --> 19:49.613
HEY, WHO TURNED
ON THE LIGHTS?

19:49.614 --> 19:52.656
WHOA!
AAH!

19:52.657 --> 19:55.162
YOU WRETCHED
REPTILES,

19:55.163 --> 19:56.934
I'LL STOP YOU.

19:56.935 --> 19:59.708
WHY NOT TAKE HOME
A FEW SOUVENIRS
FROM YOUR VISIT?

20:01.881 --> 20:03.618
I'LL FIX YOU!

20:03.619 --> 20:06.594
WOULD YOU CARE TO TANGLE
WITH THIS TURTLE?

20:06.595 --> 20:08.130
AAH!

20:08.131 --> 20:11.038
LET'S TURN
THE HEAT BACK ON.

20:11.039 --> 20:13.478
WE'RE SURROUNDED.

20:13.479 --> 20:16.219
EMERGENCY ESCAPE!

20:16.220 --> 20:17.657
WHAT THE HECK?

20:19.463 --> 20:21.433
PARACHUTES!

20:21.434 --> 20:23.773
HAVE A NICE DAY.

20:23.774 --> 20:25.645
WE GOT TO FOLLOW THEM.

20:27.217 --> 20:30.424
COWABUNGA!

20:30.425 --> 20:32.263
WHEE-HA!

20:35.572 --> 20:38.579
THEY GOT AAIN.

20:38.580 --> 20:40.217
THEY'RE PROBABLY
HALFWAY

20:40.218 --> 20:41.855
TO THE
TECHNODROME
BY NOW.

20:41.856 --> 20:46.201
DON'T WORRY, FELLAS.
ONE OF THESE DAYS,
WE'LL CATCH THAT SHREDDER.

20:46.202 --> 20:48.541
THERGY

20:48.542 --> 20:51.381
IS FLOWING BACK
INTO THE SUN.

20:51.382 --> 20:54.590
THERE. ALL BACK TO NORMAL.

20:54.591 --> 20:58.768
NOW TO SHUT THIS THING
DOWN PERMANENTLY.

21:03.916 --> 21:08.160
I HOPE THIS HAS
TAUGHT YOU ALL
A VALUABLE LESSON.

21:08.161 --> 21:10.433
IT CERTAINLY HAS, MASTER.

21:10.434 --> 21:12.104
I'VE LEARNED
NOT TO LET DOUBTS

21:12.105 --> 21:13.776
GET IN THE WAY
OF MY DUTY.

21:13.777 --> 21:16.683
AND I LEARNED
THAT I NEED TO
TRUST MY INSTINCTS

21:16.684 --> 21:18.488
AS MUCH AS
MY INVENTIONS.

21:18.489 --> 21:22.733
AND I LEARNED THAT
IT'S EASIER TO MAKE
WISECRACKS THAN DECISIONS.

21:22.734 --> 21:24.237
EXCELLENT, MY STUDENTS,

21:24.238 --> 21:27.245
AND WHAT DID YOU LEARN,
MICHELANGELO?

21:27.246 --> 21:31.758
OH, THAT YOU GOT TO STICK
TO WHAT YOU DO BEST.

21:32.862 --> 21:34.833
AND IN
THIS DUDE'S CASE,

21:34.834 --> 21:37.372
THAT'S SCARFING
DOWN PIZZAS!
