00:17.350 --> 00:25.859
**

00:30.530 --> 00:32.198
[tires squealing]
- [Quiet] Jesus!

00:32.240 --> 00:34.367
If you're tired,
just pull over.

00:34.409 --> 00:35.952
- Look, I'm on a schedule.

00:35.994 --> 00:38.288
Besides, it'd be
a lot easier

00:38.329 --> 00:40.290
if I didn't have to sit here
in complete silence.

00:45.670 --> 00:47.213
Knock-knock.

00:47.255 --> 00:49.549
- What are you doing?
- I'm telling a joke.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.384
I say, "Knock-knock."
You say, "Who's there?"

00:51.426 --> 00:53.386
- So, I should already know
the joke before you tell it?

00:53.428 --> 00:55.388
That's idiotic.
- It's a classic joke structure

00:55.430 --> 00:57.432
with a little audience
participation.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.601
I say, "Knock-knock."
You say, "Who's there?"

00:59.642 --> 01:02.354
I say somethin' like, "Orange."
You say, "Orange who?"

01:02.395 --> 01:04.481
Then I hit you
with the punch line.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.983
- Why the fuck am I
talking to an orange?

01:07.025 --> 01:08.276
- Why are you
making this so hard?

01:08.318 --> 01:09.986
Just say,
"Who's there?"

01:10.028 --> 01:12.072
Ready?

01:12.113 --> 01:13.281
Knock-knock.
[rumbling]

01:13.323 --> 01:16.576
- Do you hear that?
- Yes, it's me knocking.

01:16.618 --> 01:19.412
[rumbling]
Wait. I hear it, too.

01:21.373 --> 01:24.501
Hold on.
Activating stealth mode.

01:28.046 --> 01:32.801
[rumbling]

01:32.842 --> 01:34.260
[horns honking]

01:34.302 --> 01:36.179
Oh, shit! They have
stealth mode, too!

01:36.221 --> 01:37.889
- [Quiet]
What the hell?

01:37.931 --> 01:39.516
Just turn around.

01:39.557 --> 01:40.934
- [John Doe] I can't.
They're everywhere.

01:40.975 --> 01:42.102
- [Quiet] Oh, my god.

01:42.143 --> 01:43.144
- [John Doe] Move!
- [Quiet] Oh, my god!

01:43.186 --> 01:44.270
Fuck! Fuck!
- [John Doe] Move! Move!

01:44.312 --> 01:45.730
- Shoot them.
- [John Doe] With what?

01:45.772 --> 01:48.441
The law stripped Evelyn
back down to factory settings.

01:50.151 --> 01:51.778
Oh, I guess
they missed that one.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.029
[cocking gun]
Hey, don't waste my shells.

01:53.071 --> 01:54.406
I only have four
of those.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.366
[gunshot and ricochet]

01:56.408 --> 01:59.285
Shooting a steel door, smart.
Now, I only have three.

01:59.327 --> 02:01.871
[horns honking]

02:01.913 --> 02:03.415
[tires squealing]
[screaming]

02:03.456 --> 02:05.208
- Go faster! Go faster!
- Okay! Okay!

02:05.250 --> 02:06.876
- [Quiet] Oh, no, no, no!
Go slower! Go slower!

02:06.918 --> 02:07.961
- Make up your mind!

02:08.003 --> 02:09.921
[screaming]

02:09.963 --> 02:11.172
Whoa!

02:11.214 --> 02:14.801
[tires squeal]

02:14.843 --> 02:16.344
[gate slams]

02:22.559 --> 02:24.644
Hey!
You'll get it back

02:24.686 --> 02:26.312
when you act mature enough
to handle it.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.605
- Okay, dad.
[blows raspberry]

02:27.647 --> 02:30.775
- [Watts] Come on out,
milkman!

02:30.817 --> 02:32.318
We ain't
gonna hurt you.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.821
- Yeah, right. Huh.
Fell for that before.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.448
- You have?

02:36.489 --> 02:38.366
- [Miranda] You know,
if we wanted to,

02:38.408 --> 02:40.118
you'd be dead already.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.536
Look, I swear,

02:41.578 --> 02:44.330
I swear on
granny's steering wheel

02:44.372 --> 02:45.957
no harm is gonna
come to you.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.376
We just--
we wanna flap lips.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.962
- I don't even know
what that means.

02:51.004 --> 02:54.466
But fine.
We're comin' out.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.309
- I'm sorry that
we-we snatched ya up

03:04.351 --> 03:05.518
the way that we did,

03:05.560 --> 03:07.187
but I saw that placard
on your rump,

03:07.228 --> 03:08.646
and I was like,
we gotta talk.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.523
I'm Watts.
I run these rigs.

03:10.565 --> 03:14.194
- John. This is Quiet.
She don't talk.

03:14.235 --> 03:16.613
- Motherfucker, eat shit.
- Much.

03:16.654 --> 03:19.366
Hello. Hey.

03:19.407 --> 03:21.493
- My blood missiles?

03:21.534 --> 03:23.411
Honey, those are outside
your weight class.

03:23.453 --> 03:28.041
Oh, she's a beaut.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.959
Hmm.

03:30.001 --> 03:32.379
Did you install this limited
slip differential yourself?

03:32.420 --> 03:35.173
- Sure did. Got it off of a--
- It's backwards.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.925
[chuckles]

03:36.966 --> 03:39.719
- Wow, did you invite me here
to insult me or to talk?

03:39.761 --> 03:43.181
- Yeah, it's not really me
who wants a word.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.183
Lock it up.

03:45.225 --> 03:49.688
- Whoa.
- Whoa! [yelping]

03:49.729 --> 03:50.897
- Come on.

03:50.939 --> 04:05.870
**

04:05.870 --> 04:09.082
**

04:09.124 --> 04:11.084
Welcome to convoy.

04:11.126 --> 04:14.170
- Wow!
Okay, I'm impressed.

04:14.212 --> 04:15.088
- [Watts] Our founders
drove these semis

04:15.130 --> 04:16.506
when the walls
went up.

04:16.548 --> 04:18.883
Figure we'd better keep movin'
than be sittin' ducks.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.719
No offense, Bella.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.762
- That's a chicken.
- No, it's not.

04:22.804 --> 04:25.974
And now, our little family is
around about 30 rigs all told.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.267
- And you never stop.

04:27.308 --> 04:28.685
How the hell
do you fuel up?

04:28.727 --> 04:31.730
- Oh, nothing goes to waste,
even our waste.

04:31.771 --> 04:34.315
You see,
we take our doodies

04:34.357 --> 04:36.234
and turn 'em into fuel.
- Yeah, we get it.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.485
- Somethin' tells me

04:37.527 --> 04:39.612
I don't wanna taste
your lemonade either.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.448
- Okay, I'm gonna have
to ask y'all to stay here.

04:41.489 --> 04:42.532
Feel free
to look around.

04:42.574 --> 04:43.992
I need a lift
to the sleeper car.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.461
- So, how'd you
lose yours?

04:54.502 --> 04:57.297
Metal shear?
Angle grinder?

04:57.339 --> 04:59.966
Oh, somethin' worse.

05:00.008 --> 05:03.303
- It's fine.
- Oh, hmm.

05:03.345 --> 05:08.224
Well, uh, let me see
what I got here.

05:08.266 --> 05:13.021
Oh, this oughta fit.
- I can't pay.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.689
- Not lookin' for pay.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.859
Just think you could shine
a bit more, if you want.

05:24.449 --> 05:27.911
Mm-hmm.
That's it.

05:27.952 --> 05:29.454
- Thanks.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.914
- Don't get it wet.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.796
- Hey, she's here.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.553
- Someone there?

05:45.595 --> 05:48.056
- I brought you
to the milkman, granny.

05:48.098 --> 05:50.308
[groans]

05:50.350 --> 05:52.811
- I'd get up
and shake your hands,

05:52.852 --> 05:55.939
but my get away sticks
ain't what they used to be.

05:58.233 --> 06:01.236
- Granny,

06:01.277 --> 06:03.613
your air tubes
go to nowhere.

06:07.492 --> 06:10.245
- Well, shit.

06:10.286 --> 06:12.914
I thought I had ya.

06:12.956 --> 06:15.417
[groans]

06:15.458 --> 06:19.295
This Goddamn metal bar
keeps stickin' in my ass.

06:19.337 --> 06:22.716
Uh, uh, hey,
be careful with that.

06:22.757 --> 06:27.262
Took me ages to write,
and I only got the one copy.

06:27.303 --> 06:28.471
- You did that
while driving?

06:28.513 --> 06:29.806
[laughing]

06:29.848 --> 06:33.893
- Sometimes you gotta
throw it in reverse.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.979
[laughing]

06:36.021 --> 06:39.357
Listen, milkman,
I know I don't look it,

06:39.399 --> 06:43.695
but my insides look like
a seven car pileup.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.948
I need you to go pick up
some medicine for me.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.950
- You want me
to make a run for free?

06:48.992 --> 06:50.869
You're up to your asshole
in drivers.

06:50.910 --> 06:51.911
Ask one of them.

06:51.953 --> 06:53.621
- Can't afford to lose
any of them.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.540
- The last milkman
never came back.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.792
The roads are rough these days
with the vultures,

06:57.834 --> 07:00.879
the lawmen,
the holy men.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.630
- Don't love the sound
of that last one.

07:02.672 --> 07:05.592
- Look, I don't have time
for scenic detours.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.385
I have
a very important delivery,

07:07.427 --> 07:09.095
and I got a long way
still to go.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.847
- I heard your ride

07:10.889 --> 07:14.517
is as naked as a baby
on its birthday.

07:14.559 --> 07:17.437
You ain't gonna get far,
you can't defend yourself.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.230
Well, let me
make it plain.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.107
You do this run
for me,

07:21.149 --> 07:22.400
I'll will
saddle you up

07:22.442 --> 07:25.403
with all the upgrades
we can supply.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.239
We will weld on some guns,
right now.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.617
Get the rest
when you get back.

07:30.658 --> 07:32.202
[spits]
Deal?

07:35.622 --> 07:37.791
- Only if I get those
red missiley things.

07:37.832 --> 07:40.460
- Mnh-mnh. My blood missiles--
they ain't for sale.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.837
- You can have one.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.631
- What, granny? Come on.
- Three.

07:44.673 --> 07:45.423
- Two.
- Twenty.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.675
- Zero.
- Zero.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.471
- Okay. [spits]
One it is.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.181
- Done.
[chuckles]

07:53.223 --> 07:55.183
Pickup is at our
pharmacist's.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.685
I'll write ya up
some directions.

07:56.726 --> 07:57.977
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.604
You didn't tell me that
he's going to see her.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.606
- Where'd you think
he was goin'?

08:01.648 --> 08:05.318
Watts and the pharmacist
had a bit of a falling out.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.403
- Falling out?

08:06.444 --> 08:07.779
No, I pushed her
out of a truck.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.407
- Honey,
go weld somethin'.

08:10.448 --> 08:11.741
- I am.
I'm gonna weld somethin'.

08:11.783 --> 08:14.202
I'm gonna weld some guns
to your fucking Subaru.

08:14.244 --> 08:15.453
You fuckin'
son of a bitch.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.746
- What about Topeka?

08:16.788 --> 08:18.123
- Did you miss the fact

08:18.164 --> 08:20.208
that a semi swallowed us up
like a fuckin' whale?

08:20.250 --> 08:22.627
Now, the only way
I'm making it back to Chicago,

08:22.669 --> 08:25.213
is if Evelyn
is armed to the teeth,

08:25.255 --> 08:28.174
and now she's just gums.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.592
So, chill.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.261
I'll be back tomorrow.

08:31.302 --> 08:32.429
- Oh, no, no, no.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.014
I'm coming with you.
- Like hell you are.

08:34.055 --> 08:35.890
This is milkman business,
and you're not a milkman.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.976
[scoffs]
- If you die out there,

08:38.018 --> 08:39.978
I'm stuck here
with horndog granny.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.689
- Look, I'm not gonna die.
I give you my word.

08:42.731 --> 08:45.567
- I'm coming with you.
- Fine.

08:54.409 --> 08:55.243
- [John Doe]
"Three clicks past

08:56.453 --> 08:57.829
the oak of eight branches."
What are these?

08:57.871 --> 09:00.040
Directions to a pharmacist
or to a hidden treasure?

09:00.081 --> 09:01.374
Why couldn't she just say,
"Turn left?"

09:05.920 --> 09:08.882
So, what do you
think happened

09:08.923 --> 09:10.884
between Watts
and the pharmacist?

09:10.925 --> 09:12.844
- Don't know.
Don't care.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.721
- Oh, cool.

09:14.763 --> 09:18.016
See you got a new finger to go
with your robotic personality.

09:24.731 --> 09:33.990
**

09:34.032 --> 09:36.409
I bet that was
those holy men guys.

09:36.451 --> 09:37.452
- Oh, you think?

09:39.329 --> 09:40.497
Bad way to go.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.707
[scoffs]
- I've seen worse.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.751
Deskinned by butchers.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.671
Crushed to death
by monster trucks.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.005
That's plural.

09:49.047 --> 09:52.008
I knew a milkman that
fell asleep on an anthill,

09:52.050 --> 09:55.720
and those little shits ate 'em
alive from the insides out.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.807
Poor bastard betrayed
by his butthole.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.725
- Sounds like milkmen
don't live long.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.102
- We don't.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.770
You know, when I joined up
to be a milkman,

10:03.812 --> 10:05.105
I was skin and bones.

10:05.146 --> 10:07.524
You could play my ribcage
like a xylophone.

10:07.565 --> 10:10.318
I joined up to survive.

10:10.360 --> 10:13.279
I make my run.
I kill some vultures.

10:13.321 --> 10:16.616
I do whatever I have to
to see another sunrise.

10:16.658 --> 10:17.951
You know what
they told me

10:17.992 --> 10:19.953
when they gave me
this milkman I.D.?

10:19.994 --> 10:21.955
- Why would I know that?
I wasn't there.

10:21.996 --> 10:24.124
- You're messing
up the story.

10:26.876 --> 10:30.505
They told me
milkmen don't die old.

10:30.547 --> 10:34.884
But if I deliver this package
to New San Francisco,

10:34.926 --> 10:37.971
I might be the first.

10:38.013 --> 10:41.016
[bells tolling]

10:41.057 --> 10:43.059
- You hear those bells?

10:43.101 --> 10:45.145
- [John Doe] Holy men.

10:45.186 --> 10:48.606
Good thing they sound far away.
Let's haul ass.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.003
[knocking]
Hello?

11:13.256 --> 11:14.674
Anybody in there?
[knocking]

11:14.716 --> 11:16.176
- [Amber] Salutations.
[screaming]

11:17.719 --> 11:19.929
- [John Doe] Um, hi.

11:19.971 --> 11:22.974
We're here on, uh,
behalf of the convoy.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.517
- You're the pharmacist?

11:24.559 --> 11:26.561
- No, I'm Amber.

11:29.147 --> 11:33.026
Tea? It's gelsemium elegans.
I cut it this morning.

11:33.068 --> 11:38.782
Oh, you look
so thirsty.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.284
- I am.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.203
- The sun isn't
holding back today,

11:43.244 --> 11:45.038
are you,
you big yellow bastard?

11:45.080 --> 11:47.540
[giggles]
Bastard.

11:47.582 --> 11:50.085
Oh.

11:50.126 --> 11:53.463
So, you have refreshments.

11:55.048 --> 11:58.385
And I have questions.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.553
[retching]
- Quiet, what the fuck?

12:00.595 --> 12:02.097
[retching]

12:02.138 --> 12:05.225
- Oh, save your strength.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.394
You won't be able to move
for a little while.

12:14.317 --> 12:14.567
**

12:15.860 --> 12:17.904
- [John Doe] I knew this pickup
was a bad idea.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.740
Quiet, get my gun.
[wretches]

12:20.782 --> 12:22.867
- [Amber] Oh.

12:22.909 --> 12:27.288
So, why did you kill
the convoy's milkman?

12:27.330 --> 12:28.206
- No, I didn't.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.582
- Mnh-mnh-mnh.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.126
- [John Doe] I didn't.
I'm a replacement.

12:31.167 --> 12:34.045
You can check
my milkman placard?

12:34.087 --> 12:38.925
- This is my friend,
dendrocnide moriodes.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.219
His nickname is
Mr. Gympie-Gympie.

12:41.261 --> 12:45.807
The nettle so nice
they named him twice.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.976
He's not so nice
when you touch him, though.

12:48.018 --> 12:50.895
I've heard it's like
licking a live wire,

12:50.937 --> 12:56.109
or taking an acid shower,
or going into cardiac arrest.

12:56.151 --> 13:00.363
I wonder what it'll
feel like for you.

13:02.365 --> 13:03.616
- No.

13:03.658 --> 13:07.662
[screaming]

13:07.704 --> 13:10.707
- All I hear
is buzzing,

13:10.749 --> 13:14.794
but you aren't
a helpful little bee, are you?

13:14.836 --> 13:18.340
You're a locust,
a holy man,

13:18.381 --> 13:24.971
reveling and eating
and killing and fucking.

13:25.013 --> 13:30.143
Thankfully, I am a firm believer
in the power of recycling.

13:33.897 --> 13:36.524
- Granny, she's sick.

13:36.566 --> 13:37.692
- Okay.

13:37.734 --> 13:38.943
- No, no, no, no, no.
It's true.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.862
The medicine is for her.
You don't believe me,

13:40.904 --> 13:43.365
you can look in my pocket,
right there.

13:43.406 --> 13:44.324
[grunting]
- What are you--

13:44.366 --> 13:45.492
[sighs]

13:58.505 --> 14:00.215
Open.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.800
Chew.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.052
Okay, good.

14:04.094 --> 14:05.845
Sorry I thought
you were holy men.

14:05.887 --> 14:07.681
They're on pilgrimage,
and they're everywhere.

14:07.722 --> 14:09.099
I wouldn't.

14:09.140 --> 14:11.893
Mr. conium maculatum here
would love a chance

14:11.935 --> 14:14.020
to knock you
on your tushy.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.398
- Man,
fuck this place.

14:16.439 --> 14:21.236
- So, here is the medicine
granny requested but...

14:21.277 --> 14:24.197
[sighs]

14:24.239 --> 14:26.741
Are you sure
she wanted this?

14:26.783 --> 14:29.035
It has no
medicinal purpose.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.829
- Well, it's on the list,

14:30.870 --> 14:33.081
so maybe granny
just likes flowers.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.166
[giggles]

14:35.208 --> 14:37.502
- I never gave these
to her.

14:40.255 --> 14:43.008
Here you go.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.467
- Is it true
somebody threw you

14:44.509 --> 14:45.552
out of a moving truck?

14:48.388 --> 14:51.307
- Only because
I poisoned her first.

14:51.349 --> 14:52.475
[giggles]

14:52.517 --> 14:54.936
Watts and I have
disagreements.

14:54.978 --> 15:00.358
Plants need space
to spread their roots.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.943
[sighs]

15:01.985 --> 15:03.737
She couldn't make
room for me,

15:03.778 --> 15:07.907
so I found a place

15:07.949 --> 15:10.326
where I could have
all the space I needed,

15:10.368 --> 15:13.955
here, alone.

15:19.044 --> 15:21.171
Give my love to Granny.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.638
[bells ringing]

15:30.680 --> 15:31.973
- We can take 'em.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.356
- Nah.

15:39.397 --> 15:43.902
[engines revving]
[whooping]

15:47.697 --> 15:50.867
[bells ringing]

15:50.909 --> 15:52.202
- [Quiet]
Where are we going?

15:52.243 --> 15:54.287
- [John Doe] They've been
behind us for 50 miles,

15:54.329 --> 15:55.872
and they're only
getting closer.

15:55.914 --> 15:57.290
We gotta get off the road.

16:01.044 --> 16:03.505
[engines revving]
[whooping]

16:03.546 --> 16:04.631
[grunting]

16:12.889 --> 16:14.933
[bells ringing]

16:20.563 --> 16:21.773
[engines fading]

16:21.815 --> 16:23.066
- [John Doe] They're gone.

16:23.108 --> 16:25.819
I think we're good
for the night.

16:25.860 --> 16:26.903
Ah!

16:26.945 --> 16:28.988
- Turtle, turtle...
[fizzles out]

16:29.030 --> 16:31.199
- Pfft.
I can do that.

16:31.241 --> 16:33.034
Let's go find
a place to crash.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.161
It smell like popcorn
and ass in here.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.751
[sniffing]

16:41.793 --> 16:44.629
- Oh, my God,
am I the ass?

16:52.721 --> 16:53.972
- Huh?

16:54.014 --> 16:55.640
Solid recliner, huh?

16:55.682 --> 16:56.766
A lotta leg room.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.393
We could definitely
sleep here, right?

17:04.482 --> 17:05.275
Wait here.

17:12.615 --> 17:14.075
Good news!

17:14.117 --> 17:16.703
They have an absolute
classic in here!

17:24.544 --> 17:27.130
[footsteps nearing]

17:29.716 --> 17:31.384
- Is this a silent movie?

17:35.805 --> 17:38.975
- Hello, citizen.
Hop on.

17:39.017 --> 17:42.354
I'm pretty sure
I remember what happens.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.814
It doesn't look safe,
Blank Man,

17:44.856 --> 17:47.025
and why are you drooling?

17:47.067 --> 17:48.985
Well, because
you're so attractive.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.487
Hmm...

17:50.528 --> 17:54.657
I don't normally meet citizens
of the female persuasion.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.788
- [Quiet] Oh, no, my shoe!

17:59.829 --> 18:01.790
Why was I cursed
with such tiny feet?

18:01.831 --> 18:03.875
[laughing]

18:03.917 --> 18:06.544
It's your line.
- Oh, right.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.964
I have to say, I like when
you grab me like that.

18:10.006 --> 18:12.550
- How dare you
objectify me?

18:12.592 --> 18:15.470
- Oh, no, that's right.
I gotta keep it PG-13.

18:15.512 --> 18:17.806
- Yeah, you'd need a map to know
where to put it, anyway.

18:17.847 --> 18:20.975
[laughing]

18:21.017 --> 18:23.144
Do this a lot?

18:23.186 --> 18:24.562
- Only when I'm waiting
for a storm to pass

18:24.604 --> 18:26.856
or in between runs,
I'll check out a flick.

18:26.898 --> 18:29.067
I like the action ones.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.402
Feels good to
watch somebody else

18:30.443 --> 18:32.529
get shot at
for once, you know?

18:32.570 --> 18:33.863
You like the movies?

18:33.905 --> 18:35.949
- Mmm...

18:35.990 --> 18:37.450
We weren't allowed to
watch them.

18:39.869 --> 18:40.995
[chuckles]

18:41.037 --> 18:43.415
- What? Let me in
on the joke.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.667
- Okay.

18:45.709 --> 18:48.003
One time, my brother
snuck us into a theater

18:48.044 --> 18:50.005
when nobody was looking.

18:50.046 --> 18:52.298
- Rebel. How was it?

18:52.340 --> 18:53.883
- The movie?
I don't remember.

18:53.925 --> 18:56.594
It was with two cowboys
fighting a mechanical spider.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.096
- Love that.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.140
- All I remember, is how hard
my brother laughed.

19:00.181 --> 19:02.017
[laughing]

19:02.058 --> 19:03.727
He had a great laugh.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.729
It sounded like
a chainsaw.

19:05.770 --> 19:08.815
[laughing]

19:08.857 --> 19:11.609
- He sounds annoyin'.
- He was.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.403
He was so annoying.

19:15.739 --> 19:16.781
He was so annoying.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.161
It was so cold
in the theater.

19:21.202 --> 19:23.246
He let me wear his jacket.

19:23.288 --> 19:24.581
He never let me wear it.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.084
And now it's all I got.

19:32.213 --> 19:34.049
What?
- Oh, nothin'.

19:34.090 --> 19:37.385
It's just the first time we've
talked without a "motherfucker"

19:37.427 --> 19:39.387
or a "fuck you"
slipping in there.

19:39.429 --> 19:42.098
- Fuck you, motherfucker.
- That's better.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.184
[chuckles]

19:44.225 --> 19:47.145
- Who is this guy?
- Oh, this is the best part.

19:47.187 --> 19:51.107
So, do you wanna play
Michael "The Suit" Minnelli?

19:53.193 --> 19:56.446
- Ahh, look how thin
my mustache is!

19:56.488 --> 19:57.697
[laughing]

19:57.739 --> 19:58.448
- [John Doe] I'm coming to
get you, Minnelli,

19:58.490 --> 20:00.075
no matter what you say.

20:00.116 --> 20:01.826
- [Quiet]
You'll never catch me!

20:01.868 --> 20:05.121
I'm gonna sweat through
this satin set of pajamas.

20:05.163 --> 20:06.539
[laughing]

20:18.593 --> 20:31.064
**

20:31.106 --> 20:32.607
[clears throat]

20:32.649 --> 20:33.983
- Oh!

20:34.025 --> 20:36.611
Uh, hey, they have
running water,

20:36.653 --> 20:39.072
so I figured,
you know, laundry day.

20:39.114 --> 20:40.156
[chuckles]

20:44.619 --> 20:46.579
- Stop!
- What? What's wrong?

20:46.621 --> 20:48.289
- I didn't ask you
to do that.

20:48.331 --> 20:49.457
Didn't you hear what
I said last night?

20:49.499 --> 20:51.376
- Yes, you said
it was all you had,

20:51.418 --> 20:52.627
so I tried
to clean it.

20:52.669 --> 20:53.962
I was trying to do
somethin' nice.

20:54.004 --> 20:55.255
- You washed it!

20:57.507 --> 20:59.759
There's nothing left.
There's none of him left!

20:59.801 --> 21:03.972
I didn't even get to
say goodbye, but I had this.

21:04.014 --> 21:05.932
- Look,
I'm no bloodiologist,

21:05.974 --> 21:08.810
but I'm pretty sure it wasn't
just your brother's blood on it!

21:08.852 --> 21:09.853
[door slamming]

21:19.446 --> 21:20.613
- Oh, come on. You're still
not talkin' to me?

21:22.323 --> 21:26.536
- Hey, let me guess.
Amber poisoned you.

21:26.578 --> 21:28.955
What'd she use?
She use pink or purple?

21:28.997 --> 21:30.081
- The yellow.

21:30.123 --> 21:31.833
- Oh, that-that one
really sucks.

21:31.875 --> 21:33.084
- Yeah.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.753
- Thanks for
making the run.

21:34.794 --> 21:35.879
- I'm sure you're
looking forward

21:35.920 --> 21:36.963
to giving that to granny,

21:37.005 --> 21:40.091
so she can live
a long, horny life.

21:40.133 --> 21:42.093
- This won't save granny.

21:42.135 --> 21:43.553
Nothing will.

21:45.263 --> 21:49.726
This is to make granny more
comfortable as she passes on.

21:49.768 --> 21:58.568
**

21:58.610 --> 22:00.945
- Mmm.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.447
Ugh!

22:02.489 --> 22:06.368
Even with the flower in it,
it still tastes like piss.

22:06.409 --> 22:08.620
- I thought
we were helping you.

22:08.661 --> 22:11.623
- No. I got one gas pedal
in the grave.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.625
Ain't nothin'
gonna happen now.

22:13.667 --> 22:17.045
- I don't understand.
You're just gonna give up?

22:17.087 --> 22:21.049
- Kid,
you and I both know

22:21.091 --> 22:23.385
that most people
in this world,

22:23.426 --> 22:26.429
they-they don't have
the luxury of going quietly.

22:26.471 --> 22:30.058
Everybody else
goes loud--

22:30.100 --> 22:32.852
car crashes, gunfire.

22:32.894 --> 22:36.606
I heard about one
unlucky son of a bitch

22:36.648 --> 22:40.193
got swallowed up
by ants.

22:40.235 --> 22:41.486
Nah.

22:41.528 --> 22:44.698
This way, I get to go
on my own terms,

22:44.739 --> 22:47.992
and I get to do
somethin' rare.

22:48.034 --> 22:51.371
I get to say goodbye
to the people I love.

22:54.124 --> 22:57.293
Milkman,
you gave me a gift.

22:57.335 --> 23:00.380
You will be paid
in full.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.340
And as for you...

23:02.382 --> 23:05.260
[groans]

23:05.301 --> 23:06.970
I want you to have
a little somethin'.

23:08.513 --> 23:09.764
[laughing]

23:09.806 --> 23:15.020
Check out page 22,
the drive-thru.

23:15.061 --> 23:16.896
[laughing]

23:16.938 --> 23:20.316
- Jesus Christ.
- [Granny] You're welcome.

23:20.358 --> 23:22.610
Now, scram.

23:36.541 --> 23:39.919
I am the last
of the old timers.

23:39.961 --> 23:43.006
You're taking
the wheel now, Watts.

23:43.048 --> 23:46.968
So, let me give you
a nickel's worth of free advice.

23:47.010 --> 23:50.430
The only thing more-more
precious than--

23:50.472 --> 23:55.852
than gas, food,
porno, water,

23:55.894 --> 23:58.813
is time,

23:58.855 --> 24:03.360
time with the people
you care about.

24:03.401 --> 24:04.903
[crying]

24:10.283 --> 24:11.618
- Mnh-mnh.

24:14.496 --> 24:17.540
- Don't let
some dumb bullshit

24:17.582 --> 24:21.002
take that time
away from you.

24:21.044 --> 24:23.630
- Granny, you know, I--

24:23.672 --> 24:26.758
- Oh, no. No, kid.
I know. Now, go.

24:26.800 --> 24:29.177
You're gettin' saltwater
on my leather upholstery.

24:29.219 --> 24:38.395
**

24:38.436 --> 24:44.150
See ya soon, Fang.

24:44.192 --> 24:46.152
[sighs]

24:52.450 --> 25:00.625
**

25:00.667 --> 25:03.878
- We lost
a good driver today.

25:03.920 --> 25:06.464
Most of you knew her
as a founder,

25:06.506 --> 25:08.216
our matriarch,

25:08.258 --> 25:11.344
but the people who feared her
out on those roads,

25:11.386 --> 25:14.389
they called her
Granny Dread.

25:14.431 --> 25:16.474
[cheering]

25:16.516 --> 25:17.684
Yeah.

25:17.726 --> 25:20.770
This Beamer, this was
her pride and joy.

25:20.812 --> 25:23.815
I mean, this was her ride
when the world fell.

25:23.857 --> 25:27.694
Back then, she was
Cathy Stropton,

25:27.736 --> 25:31.823
the top selling
real estate agent in Boca Raton,

25:31.865 --> 25:36.494
a RE/MAX diamond club member
ten years in a row.

25:36.536 --> 25:38.621
She was a goddamn legend.

25:38.663 --> 25:42.000
[cheering]

25:42.042 --> 25:45.754
We wouldn't be here
without her,

25:45.795 --> 25:49.132
and we--
we will miss her.

25:49.174 --> 25:50.633
Phew.

25:55.430 --> 25:56.890
Let's stack them eights,
granny.

25:56.931 --> 25:59.184
- [all] Stack them eights.

25:59.225 --> 26:14.157
**

26:14.157 --> 26:14.783
**

26:22.624 --> 26:24.668
[cheering]

26:24.709 --> 26:25.835
- I guess that was it.

26:25.877 --> 26:28.004
Maybe we should
leave or...

26:28.046 --> 26:29.047
[cheering]

26:29.089 --> 26:30.590
Oh, shit!

26:34.219 --> 26:44.854
**

26:44.896 --> 26:45.438
* Talk to me ooh *

26:45.480 --> 26:48.566
- Yeah!

26:48.608 --> 26:49.818
* Talk to me *

26:51.820 --> 26:55.407
* Talk to me ooh *

26:55.448 --> 26:56.825
* Talk to me *

26:59.285 --> 27:03.707
* Do you think you're
better off alone *

27:06.584 --> 27:10.922
* Do you think you're
better off alone *

27:10.964 --> 27:25.937
**

27:34.320 --> 27:37.449
* Talk to me ooh *

27:37.490 --> 27:38.908
* Talk to me *

27:41.286 --> 27:46.207
* Talk to me ooh *

27:46.249 --> 27:48.126
* Talk to me *

27:48.168 --> 27:52.547
[humming]

27:52.589 --> 27:53.882
- [Watts]
Twister to Flower Power.

27:53.923 --> 27:55.425
Come in, Flower Power.

27:55.467 --> 28:06.853
**

28:06.895 --> 28:07.896
[clears throat]

28:07.937 --> 28:10.357
- This is Flower Power.

28:10.398 --> 28:14.944
- I didn't think I'd hear
your voice again, Amber.

28:14.986 --> 28:17.322
- Didn't think
you wanted to.

28:20.283 --> 28:21.951
I'm sorry about granny.

28:21.993 --> 28:24.120
- [Watts] I'm sorry, too,

28:24.162 --> 28:28.458
but I'm-I'm more sorry
that I-I pushed you away.

28:29.959 --> 28:31.711
- I miss you, too, hon.

28:31.753 --> 28:34.172
- Oh, yeah?

28:34.214 --> 28:37.384
You do?

28:37.425 --> 28:38.760
[cheering]

28:38.802 --> 28:40.095
* All the things she said
all the things she said *

28:40.136 --> 28:41.054
* Running through my head
running through my head *

28:41.096 --> 28:42.347
* Running through my head *

28:42.389 --> 28:43.682
- Lucky number .17.

28:43.723 --> 28:45.809
I knew
you could do it!

28:48.687 --> 28:50.313
- I brought you
a whiskey and Tang.

28:53.733 --> 28:56.444
So, about the jacket, um...

28:56.486 --> 28:58.738
I mean, I thought...

28:58.780 --> 29:00.532
[sighs]

29:00.573 --> 29:03.743
I-I mean, I heard
what you said.

29:03.785 --> 29:04.536
I wasn't thinking.
I just--

29:04.577 --> 29:05.745
- Get to the point.

29:07.706 --> 29:08.832
- I'm sorry.

29:16.923 --> 29:18.383
* All the things she said
all the things she said *

29:18.425 --> 29:20.427
* Running through my head
running through my head *

29:20.468 --> 29:22.721
* Running through my head *

29:22.762 --> 29:24.973
You ever think
about staying?

29:25.015 --> 29:28.560
I mean, the convoy is exactly
what you and your brother

29:28.601 --> 29:30.687
were looking for,
safe, secure.

29:30.729 --> 29:32.105
It's a city,

29:32.147 --> 29:34.149
just with wheels
instead of walls.

29:36.860 --> 29:39.571
- Maybe if things
were different.

29:39.612 --> 29:41.406
How about you?

29:41.448 --> 29:42.490
- They offered.

29:42.532 --> 29:43.742
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

29:43.783 --> 29:46.119
Not gonna lie.
It sounded cushy,

29:46.161 --> 29:48.246
but I'd still be
a milkman.

29:48.288 --> 29:51.875
I don't want that.
I wanna get old.

29:51.916 --> 29:54.085
Die an uneventful death.

29:54.127 --> 29:55.378
[scoffs]

29:55.420 --> 29:56.963
- There's no such thing.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.093
* All the things she said
all the things she said *

30:02.135 --> 30:03.928
* Running through my head
running through my head *

30:03.970 --> 30:05.513
* Running through my head *

30:05.555 --> 30:09.225
* This is not enough *

30:09.267 --> 30:11.686
- Jesus. Maybe if you'd
stop blasting the heat,

30:11.728 --> 30:12.937
you'd stop falling asleep.

30:12.979 --> 30:16.149
- I don't like
to drive cold.

30:16.191 --> 30:31.122
**

30:31.122 --> 30:32.540
**

30:32.582 --> 30:36.378
Hey, Quiet.
Knock-knock.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.634
- Who's there?

30:42.676 --> 30:57.399
**

31:12.455 --> 31:27.387
**

31:27.387 --> 31:27.554
**
