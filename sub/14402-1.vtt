01:11.863 --> 01:13.490
My name is Tom Sims.

01:14.283 --> 01:15.742
I'm a newspaper columnist.

01:17.327 --> 01:19.413
Several years ago I covered firsthand

01:19.663 --> 01:24.001
the incredible story you are about to see
re-created in this motion picture.

01:25.335 --> 01:29.131
It is a human horror story
of ghastly proportions and ...

01:30.090 --> 01:32.301
...profound reverberations.

01:33.802 --> 01:36.972
But because it is human,
perhaps we can learn something from it.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.600
Something of ourselves ...

01:40.309 --> 01:42.394
...of our own fears and needs.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.731
But please, let me warn you ...

01:46.982 --> 01:50.152
The events have been
re-created in detail.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.655
Nothing has been left
to the imagination.

01:54.031 --> 01:56.533
It is not a story
for the squeamish ...

01:56.992 --> 01:58.952
...or the faint-hearted.

02:00.829 --> 02:03.957
Now that you stand warned,
we can proceed with our story.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.544
It is the story of Ezra Cobb:

02:07.753 --> 02:10.213
murderer, grave robber, ...

02:11.340 --> 02:12.924
...necrophiliac perhaps, ...

02:13.717 --> 02:17.179
...or, as you may remember him
from those stories of long ago,

02:17.846 --> 02:19.473
...the Butcher of Woodside.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.485
'When Ez was 10,
his father died.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.362
'For the next 15 years,

02:33.362 --> 02:35.739
'Ez and his mother worked
the farm by themselves,

02:35.906 --> 02:39.159
'growing more dependent on each other
with the passage of time.

02:39.368 --> 02:41.787
'Then Amanda Cobb suffered
a paralysing stroke

02:41.787 --> 02:43.789
'which crippled her body
from the waist down

02:43.789 --> 02:45.374
'and left her bedridden.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.125
'Ez brought her downstairs,

02:47.125 --> 02:50.295
'sealing off the upstairs room,
so he could be closer to her.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.090
'For 12 years,
he slept outside her door,

02:53.256 --> 02:56.343
'waiting on her, feeding her,
bathing her,

02:56.510 --> 02:58.845
'reading to her, comforting her.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.683
'To his neighbours,
he was a devoted son.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.062
'But that devotion masked
a growing psychosis

03:07.437 --> 03:10.440
'which came to the surface
when his mother died.'

03:21.201 --> 03:22.202
Mama?

03:24.121 --> 03:25.455
Brought you some soup, Mama.

03:26.748 --> 03:27.916
It's good and hot today.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.053
Ez?

03:42.889 --> 03:44.057
Take my hand.

03:47.018 --> 03:48.812
Are you holding my hand?

03:49.730 --> 03:51.605
Yes.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.024
I can't feel you.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.904
Cold. Must be ... draughts.

04:07.289 --> 04:09.791
Just got to get the circulation
going again, that's all.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.961
So it's to be now, then, is it?

04:15.505 --> 04:17.841
I can't see you too clearly, Ez.

04:18.008 --> 04:19.301
You look blurred.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.095
You're ... you're tired, Mama, is all.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.973
- Here, I brought you some soup.
- No.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.600
- Good and hot.
- No.

04:26.892 --> 04:29.519
I'm not tired,
and I don't want no soup.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.189
- I'm dying.
- No, Mama.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.274
I'm dying,
and that's all there is to it.

04:34.441 --> 04:37.152
No'm. You just need
some rest is all.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.779
Now, you be quiet
and listen to me.

04:38.945 --> 04:42.532
If I go into a coma,
don't take me to no hospital.

04:42.741 --> 04:46.077
I want to die in my own bed,
my own room, ...

04:46.661 --> 04:47.954
...with you here.

04:48.538 --> 04:51.958
If you need any help later,
after I'm gone, ...

04:52.459 --> 04:55.378
...call Maureen Selby.

04:56.087 --> 04:59.966
Say it now, Ez. Maureen Selby.

05:00.175 --> 05:01.176
Mau...

05:01.802 --> 05:04.221
Maureen ... Selby.

05:04.888 --> 05:07.057
Maureen's the only woman
I ever did trust.

05:07.557 --> 05:10.101
She's fat, that's why. A big heifer.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.771
But she's the only
good-hearted woman I ever knew.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.565
As for the rest of them, ...

05:16.024 --> 05:20.362
...they're a lot of filthy,
black-souled sluts

05:20.529 --> 05:22.405
with pus-filled sores that ...

05:24.533 --> 05:26.116
Ez?

05:26.117 --> 05:27.118
Ez ...

05:28.537 --> 05:29.538
I ...

05:29.788 --> 05:33.375
I... I c-can't br-breathe.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.378
You're gonna be all right.

05:36.837 --> 05:40.090
You just need ...
something to eat, that's all.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.508
Honest!

05:41.925 --> 05:45.178
I know I'm ...
I'm leaving you now.

05:46.263 --> 05:47.681
And that's for certain.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.768
I don't want to leave
worrying about you.

05:52.894 --> 05:57.482
Oh, you're such
a babe in the woods, a child.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.694
I sheltered you too much, I guess.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.115
But I just know
some money-stealing bitch

06:05.282 --> 06:08.410
is gonna come along
and try to take advantage of you.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.289
Remember what I've always told you.

06:12.747 --> 06:16.668
The wages of sin is gonorrhoea,
syphilis and death!

06:17.168 --> 06:22.299
They'll use their bodies to ...
to steal from you.

06:22.841 --> 06:25.468
They'll steal your life and your soul.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.139
Leave 'em alone.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.767
Most of 'em are filled
with diseases that tick.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.689
God will wash them away ...

06:38.899 --> 06:41.401
...like he did in the time of Noah.

06:43.737 --> 06:48.158
God looked upon the earth,
and behold, it was corrupt, ...

06:49.576 --> 06:53.204
...for all flesh had corrupted
his way upon the earth.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.374
Then God said unto Noah, ...

06:57.375 --> 07:00.545
"The end of all flesh
is come before me."

07:02.589 --> 07:04.966
Do you know what God
did then, Ez?

07:05.550 --> 07:07.886
Yes'm. The flood.

07:09.012 --> 07:12.140
Yes, sir ... the flood.

07:13.141 --> 07:16.394
Oh, I wish I could
be here to see it.

07:18.730 --> 07:21.399
You're still a handsome
young man, Ez.

07:22.567 --> 07:25.320
You'll have great attraction
for the opposite sex.

07:27.447 --> 07:31.660
That's why you gotta be so careful.

07:33.495 --> 07:37.040
Oh, Ez ... it hurts.

07:38.708 --> 07:39.876
Hurts.

07:40.669 --> 07:42.628
Eat.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.839
You'll be all right, honest.

07:51.513 --> 07:54.432
No, you won't die, honest.

07:59.396 --> 08:00.563
Please, Mama.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.816
Please, Mama, don't leave me.

08:06.945 --> 08:08.738
Mama, no, please.

08:08.947 --> 08:11.408
No, please. No.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.745
Mama, Mama.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.623
Mama ...

09:27.567 --> 09:29.277
How you holding up, Ez?

09:32.572 --> 09:34.449
We're so sorry, Ez.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.543
She was a great lady, Ez.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.088
Real ...

09:50.340 --> 09:51.925
Real demure.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.973
Real religious.

10:05.396 --> 10:07.732
The boys wanted to come, Ez, but ...

10:07.941 --> 10:10.610
Well, I didn't think they should.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.571
But they do send
their condolences, though.

10:21.496 --> 10:23.456
She looks nice, Ez.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.501
Real natural.

10:29.254 --> 10:31.464
You'd think
she was just sleeping.

10:36.511 --> 10:38.054
She is.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.602
That's all it is.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.983
Just sleep.

11:13.214 --> 11:16.467
A month passed.
Six months. A year.

11:17.343 --> 11:20.096
Still Ezra refused to accept
the death of his mother.

11:21.055 --> 11:24.309
He visited her grave
as often as four or five times a week.

11:25.268 --> 11:27.561
And at home ...

11:27.562 --> 11:30.315
'At home he continued
as though she were only away on a trip.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.692
'He kept her room neat and clean

11:32.859 --> 11:34.569
'and made sure
the stove was always going,

11:34.569 --> 11:36.738
'so it would be warm
when she returned to him.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.073
'He dreamed about her,

11:39.657 --> 11:42.243
'and in his despair
even wrote letters to her.

11:44.454 --> 11:48.750
'To the outside world,
Ez was, oh, a little eccentric maybe,

11:48.750 --> 11:50.877
'but basically a normal, decent guy.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.962
'He quit farming altogether

11:53.129 --> 11:55.965
'and hired on as a general
handyman for his neighbours

11:56.132 --> 11:58.426
'and especially his good friend
Harlan Kootz.'

11:58.593 --> 12:01.596
Bobby, come on.
It's time to go.

12:01.763 --> 12:02.847
OK, Mum.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.307
Bye.

12:05.308 --> 12:08.645
'But the loneliness within him
had grown to a vast abyss,

12:08.811 --> 12:12.190
'and the pain of his loss at last
pushed him over the precipice

12:12.357 --> 12:13.524
'and into madness.'

12:13.691 --> 12:15.151
Mama ...

12:18.196 --> 12:20.323
...when you comin' home again?

12:27.622 --> 12:29.749
I'm real lonesome, Mama.

12:32.126 --> 12:38.049
There's nothing
but snow and snow and snow.

12:39.509 --> 12:42.845
And the wind blowing
and blowing and blowing.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.641
And it's so cold.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.729
And I miss you with all my heart.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.275
Amen.

13:00.530 --> 13:04.701
'If you miss me so much,
why don't you come and bring me home?'

13:06.369 --> 13:07.537
Mama?

13:09.956 --> 13:12.333
'You should be
ashamed of yourself, ...

13:12.917 --> 13:16.713
...'leaving me here
more than a year now.

13:17.714 --> 13:21.050
'I'm all alone
here in the dark.

13:21.259 --> 13:22.885
'Shame, Ez!'

13:24.679 --> 13:27.974
Mama, I wrote to you.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.145
'Don't get no letters here.

13:33.896 --> 13:36.899
'Now, why don't you come
and bring me home?

13:38.401 --> 13:39.944
'Bring me home ...

13:40.987 --> 13:42.530
'Bring me home ...'

13:45.616 --> 13:47.910
I'm comin', Mama!

13:48.953 --> 13:50.705
'And so he went
to bring her home.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.433
'Perhaps, in his twisted mind

14:10.600 --> 14:13.895
'he imagined she would look
the way she had in life.'

14:27.617 --> 14:29.911
Mama. Mama.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.364
I'm takin' you home, Mama.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.700
Home.

15:14.497 --> 15:17.834
♪ She's the girl of my dreams ♪

15:18.000 --> 15:21.129
♪ And her fair face beams ♪

15:21.129 --> 15:25.299
♪ She's the sweetheart ♪
♪ of Sigma Chi ... ♪

15:56.581 --> 15:59.667
What in the hell
do you think you're doing, Ez?

15:59.876 --> 16:02.712
N-nothin', sir.
What do you mean?

16:02.920 --> 16:05.298
Oh, come on.
You know what I mean.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.677
Well, she wanted
to come home, Sheriff.

16:10.553 --> 16:13.139
- She told me she did. Otherwise I...
- Now, look, look, look.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.683
This is a 35-mile-an-hour zone,

16:15.850 --> 16:18.728
and you were going 50
if you were going anything.

16:18.895 --> 16:20.646
Now, let me smell your breath.

16:21.606 --> 16:25.651
Good God!
What in the hell is that?

16:26.360 --> 16:29.697
What have you been drinkin', Ez?
Goddamn!

16:31.657 --> 16:35.745
Nothin', sir, er...
It's just a hog I butchered is all.

16:35.912 --> 16:39.874
Er... I forgot to take it out of the truck.
It kind of got to smellin'.

16:40.041 --> 16:42.960
Jesus Christ, you ain't kiddin'!

16:46.297 --> 16:50.092
I'm gonna let you go this time, Ez,
but don't let it happen again, you hear?

16:51.469 --> 16:55.306
And for Christ's sake,
bury that, will you?

16:55.473 --> 16:56.599
Yes, sir.

16:57.391 --> 17:00.102
I sure will ... er, first thing.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.480
No more speeding, you hear?

17:02.647 --> 17:03.648
Yes, sir.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.483
I mean, no, sir.

17:06.275 --> 17:17.369
All right.

17:17.370 --> 17:20.540
I apologise for calling you
a hog, Mama.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.797
Get you in bed.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.925
You need to lie back down.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.011
Fix you up.

17:34.178 --> 17:37.223
You won't even
know yourself, honest.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.645
See your room?

17:44.230 --> 17:45.356
Just like it used to be.

18:07.962 --> 18:09.547
Oh, Mama.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.175
You're in terrible shape.

18:21.684 --> 18:24.061
Gonna have to put you
back together

18:24.228 --> 18:26.897
like that old egg in the fairy story.

18:32.737 --> 18:35.031
I'm glad you're home.

18:42.872 --> 18:44.332
Here's your Bible.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.383
Your bell.

19:02.683 --> 19:03.851
So he brought her home.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.145
And what now?

19:07.563 --> 19:09.607
Now he intended to restore her.

19:10.733 --> 19:13.402
And to that purpose
he began reading everything he could

19:13.569 --> 19:16.489
about embalming ... taxidermy.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.075
But it wasn't an easy job.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.370
His mother had been buried
for over a year now.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.664
There were lots of repairs to make.

19:25.373 --> 19:27.875
He tried to patch her
with fish skin, with wax,

19:28.042 --> 19:32.129
with any substance which he thought
resembled human flesh.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.675
It wasn't until later

19:36.133 --> 19:38.260
that the idea of using
real flesh occurred to him.

19:41.555 --> 19:44.016
'Ironically enough,
it was his friend and neighbour

19:44.016 --> 19:45.851
'who accidentally gave him
the inspiration.'

19:46.560 --> 19:48.813
God is great, God is good,

19:48.979 --> 19:51.023
let us thank him for this food.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.149
Amen.

19:52.692 --> 19:56.445
Oh, and please take good care
of old Miss Johnson.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.949
Pass the bread to Ezra,
will you, Brad?

20:00.116 --> 20:01.575
What's the matter
with old Miss Johnson?

20:01.742 --> 20:02.827
She kicked the bucket.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.496
She didn't kick the bucket.
She passed away.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.957
My Miss Johnson?
My old Sunday School teacher?

20:08.165 --> 20:10.668
- The very same one.
- I don't believe that.

20:10.668 --> 20:13.546
It's right here in today's paper.
Here it is.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.131
The funeral was this afternoon.

20:16.841 --> 20:19.009
That lady taught me
all through Sunday School

20:19.176 --> 20:20.720
and in the sixth grade.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.472
Taught Ez, too.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.683
Remember that, Ez,
back in sixth grade?

20:25.850 --> 20:27.226
Used to call her
"old flannel face".

20:28.060 --> 20:30.229
- Remember that, Ez?
- No, sir.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.065
Yeah, that's her, all right.

20:34.984 --> 20:36.068
Here. Remember her, Ez?

20:37.695 --> 20:40.239
Oh, that's ...
that's old Miss Johnson there.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.575
What's she doing
in the newspaper?

20:43.242 --> 20:45.202
Dang it, Ez,
I just told you she's dead.

20:45.995 --> 20:49.248
You mean they put her in the paper
just 'cause she's dead?

20:51.959 --> 20:54.253
What's the matter with you, Ez?
That's her danged obituary.

20:55.796 --> 20:56.797
Her what?

20:57.840 --> 21:00.050
Don't tell me you don't know
what's an obituary.

21:03.012 --> 21:04.930
If that don't beat all.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.600
Well, look, when a body dies,
they take all the information

21:07.767 --> 21:10.728
and they put it in the newspaper
in the obituary section.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.354
It tells when the funeral is

21:12.521 --> 21:14.857
and where they're being buried
and all that kind of stuff.

21:15.232 --> 21:16.525
You mean I can find out ...

21:17.443 --> 21:19.320
...where and when
somebody's been buried ...

21:20.154 --> 21:21.530
...on the very same day?

21:22.865 --> 21:25.785
Light at the end of the tunnel,
all right, yes, siree.

21:25.951 --> 21:26.952
You're right, Ez.

21:27.745 --> 21:28.871
Well, I'm gonna look into that.

21:29.872 --> 21:31.957
I'd rather read
the sports section, myself.

21:32.333 --> 21:35.795
Not me. This here could be
real valuable information.

21:36.086 --> 21:39.089
Why? What are you planning to do?
Dig 'em up or something?

21:39.256 --> 21:42.510
No, sir.
Wouldn't have to dig it all up.

21:44.386 --> 21:45.971
Well, I'm sure glad to hear that.

21:46.597 --> 21:49.475
Sure. Why dig it all up
when you can take the parts you need?

21:49.642 --> 21:51.393
Sure, maybe like ...

21:52.770 --> 21:55.481
...like if you needed the head
for repairs or something,

21:55.898 --> 21:57.775
...well, then, just take the head.

22:01.403 --> 22:04.323
Oh, Ez, you're a crazy S.O.B.

22:09.370 --> 22:11.956
Hi, Miss Johnson. Remember me?

22:12.665 --> 22:14.583
I used to be in your
Sunday School class.

22:27.805 --> 22:31.141
There she comes now, real easy.

22:34.895 --> 22:38.774
Next thing to do is get this hair off.

23:40.961 --> 23:42.296
See, Mama?

23:42.296 --> 23:45.132
All I got to do is stitch it on you.

23:54.516 --> 23:55.893
Look, Mama.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.395
I brought you a visitor.

24:13.327 --> 24:16.664
Shh. Don't stay too long, now.

24:23.879 --> 24:26.840
Bet you two ladies have
a lot to talk about.

24:32.346 --> 24:34.723
After that, Ezra made
many visits to the graveyard,

24:34.890 --> 24:38.185
bringing home bodies,
or parts of bodies, ...

24:39.436 --> 24:41.188
...to keep his mother
and himself company.

24:42.481 --> 24:46.694
He was a ghoul, a necromaniac,
a defiler of the dead, ...

24:48.028 --> 24:50.948
...but he had not yet turned
his sickness on a living victim.

24:52.783 --> 24:55.244
It was only a matter of time
until he did.

24:55.786 --> 24:58.831
We're gonna have to take those plugs out,
and take 'em into town -

24:58.831 --> 25:00.874
either get 'em cleaned
or get new ones.

25:15.472 --> 25:17.141
- Ez?
- Sir?

25:18.100 --> 25:21.937
Er, me and Mother,
we've been talking and, er...

25:23.939 --> 25:25.733
Well, we've been thinking that...

25:26.984 --> 25:28.235
Sir?

25:28.902 --> 25:31.113
Well, dang it all, first off,
stop callin' me "sir".

25:31.280 --> 25:32.573
You're as old as I am.

25:32.906 --> 25:35.492
And secondly,
stop callin' Jenny "ma'am".

25:35.492 --> 25:37.077
You're a growed man, Ez.

25:37.828 --> 25:40.873
That's what I want...
wanted. to talk to you about.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.667
I wanted to talk to you
man to man.

25:45.210 --> 25:48.714
See, we're... well, Jenny and me,
we're worried about you,

25:48.922 --> 25:51.050
living up in that old house
there all by yourself,

25:51.216 --> 25:55.512
and, er, we just thought that...
well, we...

25:56.930 --> 25:58.682
Dang it, Jennifer says
you should be married,

25:58.849 --> 26:01.310
and that's what she says
and that's that, so...

26:01.810 --> 26:04.188
Ezra, what my husband
means is that ...

26:04.730 --> 26:06.899
Well, we're just kind of worried
about you, that's all,

26:07.066 --> 26:10.527
and, well, we thought it would be nice
if you could meet someone,

26:10.694 --> 26:12.946
and I'd be glad to introduce you
if you wanted,

26:13.113 --> 26:17.659
you know, someone nice who could be
a companion for you, that's all.

26:18.452 --> 26:20.454
Nope. No'm.

26:22.414 --> 26:23.499
I don't trust 'em.

26:24.374 --> 26:25.876
You don't trust who, Ez?

26:26.376 --> 26:29.797
You know... girls and stuff.

26:30.631 --> 26:31.964
Damn right.

26:31.965 --> 26:34.093
Don't you know any girls
you could trust, Ezra?

26:34.802 --> 26:35.844
No'm.

26:36.720 --> 26:41.600
Except my mother
and Maureen Selby.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.144
Say, I can trust her.

26:45.270 --> 26:46.980
I know I can trust her.

26:47.856 --> 26:50.025
Why do you think
you can trust her, Ez?

26:50.025 --> 26:52.569
Aw, 'cause... she's fat.

26:53.987 --> 26:56.990
I know I can trust her. She's fat.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.370
Well then, why don't you
give her a call?

27:02.579 --> 27:04.414
- Think I should?
- Sure.

27:04.581 --> 27:06.083
Go ahead, Ez, why don't you?

27:06.250 --> 27:08.210
Maybe it'll help her
lose some weight.

27:49.501 --> 27:50.627
Yes?

27:51.628 --> 27:53.463
- Miss Selby?
- Yes?

27:54.506 --> 27:55.841
I'm Ezra Cobb.

27:56.675 --> 27:57.718
Yes?

27:59.261 --> 28:00.721
Amanda Cobb's boy.

28:01.555 --> 28:06.602
Amanda Cobb's boy?
Oh, come in, do.

28:06.768 --> 28:10.355
Oh, my!
Yes, Amanda Cobb.

28:10.355 --> 28:12.608
I was so sorry to hear
about her passing.

28:12.774 --> 28:17.654
Do you know that she and I were once
as close as two webbed fingers?

28:17.654 --> 28:20.741
And then ...
something happened.

28:20.741 --> 28:22.951
I don't know. She took on
a grudge or something.

28:23.160 --> 28:25.954
She always had a grudge
going against somebody.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.289
Do sit down.

28:28.040 --> 28:31.752
I don't know what it was, I don't like
to cast aspersions on the dead,

28:31.919 --> 28:36.715
but Amanda did take on a grudge
like a steel trap to a rabbit's foot.

28:37.883 --> 28:41.637
So then whenever I tried to see her
she wouldn't even let me in.

28:41.637 --> 28:43.764
Oh, come and sit over here.

28:43.764 --> 28:45.974
It's more comfortable,
the big cushion.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.811
So, er...

28:49.978 --> 28:55.484
So then I didn't see her again for oh...
many, many years.

28:55.651 --> 28:57.069
And, er...

28:58.028 --> 29:00.447
Would you like something to drink?

29:00.447 --> 29:01.448
No'm.

29:01.615 --> 29:04.034
I'm sorry
I can't offer you hard liquor,

29:04.243 --> 29:06.328
but I have never taken
a drink in my life,

29:06.495 --> 29:08.330
and I never will.

29:08.497 --> 29:10.666
How about some
Whitman's Sampler?

29:14.753 --> 29:18.215
They're my one vice, damn it.

29:20.050 --> 29:23.178
Well, Mr Cobb, what do you do?

29:26.890 --> 29:27.891
Ma'am?

29:28.725 --> 29:32.187
- Well, what do you do?
- Oh.

29:33.230 --> 29:34.982
Just, er, take care of Mama

29:35.190 --> 29:37.818
and keep the house in order,
I guess.

29:38.277 --> 29:41.989
Take care of Mama?
Y-y-you mean, your mother?

29:42.364 --> 29:44.031
Yes'm.

29:44.032 --> 29:46.243
- Today at lunch, she said that...
- Mr Cobb.

29:48.453 --> 29:51.206
You talk to your mother?

29:53.375 --> 29:54.751
Yes'm.

29:55.711 --> 30:00.465
Mr Cobb,
are you making fun of me?

30:02.175 --> 30:03.593
No'm.

30:04.344 --> 30:05.721
You sure?

30:06.763 --> 30:07.806
Yes'm.

30:08.890 --> 30:09.891
Cross my heart.

30:12.019 --> 30:14.146
I thought you were
making fun of me.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.357
A lot of people around here do,
you know.

30:18.525 --> 30:20.110
They make fun of me because...

30:21.445 --> 30:22.904
Because...

30:25.032 --> 30:27.367
I talk to Herbert.

30:28.243 --> 30:29.244
Herbert?

30:29.870 --> 30:33.999
My late husband.
I talk to him all the time.

30:42.299 --> 30:44.301
This is his picture, see?

30:45.177 --> 30:47.262
He was killed four years ago.

30:48.263 --> 30:51.683
Burned up in an automobile
accident on Route 7.

30:53.226 --> 30:54.603
We were very happy.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.231
We still are.
At least, he tells me he is.

30:58.231 --> 31:00.233
I spoke to him last night.

31:01.568 --> 31:03.403
Say, Ezra, you know
what we ought to do?

31:03.403 --> 31:06.740
- Is it all right if I call you Ezra?
- Yes'm.

31:06.907 --> 31:10.744
Well, Ezra, why don't we all
get together some night

31:10.911 --> 31:16.124
and hold a four-way séance -
you, me, Herbert, and Amanda?

31:16.291 --> 31:19.211
That is, if Amanda’s
speaking to me nowadays.

31:19.378 --> 31:20.504
What do you say?

31:21.505 --> 31:25.675
Er, you mean
all get together and talk?

31:25.842 --> 31:29.679
Oh, yes. Oh, it'll be such fun.
Herbert's never met Amanda. Please?

31:31.264 --> 31:33.058
Um, I don't know.

31:34.142 --> 31:36.686
Well, um... I'll ask her.

31:37.229 --> 31:39.815
Make it Thursday night.
Shake on it?

31:46.530 --> 31:49.533
She is fat, Mama,
just like you said.

31:52.119 --> 31:53.537
But I like that fat.

31:56.915 --> 31:59.501
Big ol' arms,
flesh just hanging down.

32:01.336 --> 32:02.337
I like that.

32:04.005 --> 32:08.927
The legs, too. Big and round
like big ol' drumsticks.

32:10.345 --> 32:13.181
She's got a cute little belly.
Cute as can be.

32:16.977 --> 32:20.981
Of course, I'd hate
to get stuck in all of that fat.

32:21.648 --> 32:22.941
Might not be able to get out.

32:24.734 --> 32:29.239
So naturally, I'll take
some protection along just in case.

32:34.244 --> 32:37.914
You know the only thing
that bothers me?

32:39.958 --> 32:41.460
I don't think she's, er...

32:42.627 --> 32:46.381
you know, er...
all there in the upstairs.

32:48.383 --> 32:56.682
Know what I mean?

32:56.683 --> 33:00.270
Herbert wants to talk to me tonight.
I can feel it.

33:01.938 --> 33:07.569
All we have to do ...
is concentrate.

33:07.736 --> 33:09.613
Can you concentrate, Ez?

33:11.615 --> 33:14.450
Yes'm.

33:14.451 --> 33:20.332
Close your eyes, then,
and concentrate.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.217
Herbert.

33:31.968 --> 33:33.470
Herbert.

33:33.637 --> 33:36.973
Herbert, enter me.

33:37.474 --> 33:41.811
Oh, enter me,
Herbert, enter me.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.357
Enter me! Enter me! Oh!

33:47.526 --> 33:49.528
Oh, yes.

33:49.778 --> 33:54.324
Oh, Herbert, I hear you.

33:54.324 --> 33:57.410
Yes. Can you hear me?

33:58.203 --> 34:01.790
You can? Oh, good.

34:01.790 --> 34:04.084
Then listen, Herbert.

34:04.292 --> 34:08.713
I have a new friend here tonight.

34:08.880 --> 34:13.718
His name is Ezra Cobb,

34:13.885 --> 34:20.141
and he's ...
he's very nice-looking, Herbert.

34:20.308 --> 34:26.856
He's tall and straight and strong,

34:26.856 --> 34:32.279
and he's ...
he's the right age.

34:34.114 --> 34:35.699
What, Herbert?

34:36.866 --> 34:38.994
Oh! Oh ...

34:40.245 --> 34:45.542
Herbert,
I can't ask him that.

34:46.626 --> 34:48.920
What? Ask him what?

34:49.129 --> 34:56.845
Oh, Herbert, that is so sweet
and unselfish of you.

34:58.638 --> 35:00.307
What does he want?

35:01.099 --> 35:05.186
Oh, well, Ez ...

35:07.314 --> 35:10.233
He says he misses ...

35:11.234 --> 35:15.447
...the carnal aspect of our marriage.

35:16.781 --> 35:18.116
Carnival?

35:18.283 --> 35:20.660
Er, no, no. The ...

35:21.578 --> 35:25.081
You know, our sex life.

35:26.249 --> 35:29.461
Well, yes, it was beautiful, Herbert.

35:32.589 --> 35:35.467
What kind of...?
What favour does he want?

35:38.345 --> 35:42.265
Oh, Ez, Herbert says ...

35:44.559 --> 35:49.230
...he's going to talk to you ...
himself.

35:58.406 --> 36:00.533
Ezra...

36:02.285 --> 36:05.830
Ezra Cobb?

36:09.167 --> 36:11.961
Yeah ... yes, sir?
Er ... yes, ma'am?

36:12.253 --> 36:19.302
Ezra, this is Herbert.

36:20.887 --> 36:27.894
Will you do me a favour, Ezra?

36:28.186 --> 36:30.897
If I... if I can, sir.

36:31.856 --> 36:39.989
Make my wife...
a woman again.

36:42.409 --> 36:44.160
H-how do you mean, sir?

36:47.497 --> 36:53.837
She needs love, Ezra.

36:55.672 --> 36:59.509
Physical love.

37:00.760 --> 37:07.600
The kind I can no longer give her.

37:09.519 --> 37:11.604
Oh, touch her, Ezra.

37:12.897 --> 37:16.943
Feel how soft she is.

37:26.619 --> 37:30.999
It's been so long.

37:35.420 --> 37:38.715
Oh, come, Ezra.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.510
Go with her.

37:43.511 --> 37:47.599
Do her that favour.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.851
Make love to her.

37:50.018 --> 37:52.270
It's been so long.

37:52.437 --> 37:54.230
She needs it, Ezra.

37:54.397 --> 37:56.274
Ezra, she needs it!

37:57.442 --> 37:59.444
She needs it, Ezra.

37:59.444 --> 38:02.572
Come into the bedroom.

38:19.589 --> 38:22.217
Oh, come. Oh, come.

38:23.176 --> 38:25.637
Come on. Come...

38:27.222 --> 38:29.307
Oh, yes, come.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.980
Oh, yes, yes.

38:35.980 --> 38:38.399
Make love to me, darling.

38:40.401 --> 38:45.907
The wages of sin is gonorrhoea,
syphilis and death!

38:46.866 --> 38:51.663
It's been so long, darling, so long.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.582
You know what God done then,
don't you, boy?

38:55.333 --> 38:57.919
Yes, Mama. The flood.

38:59.504 --> 39:02.674
Take off your pants, darling.

39:02.841 --> 39:06.051
Vermin.

39:06.052 --> 39:11.015
There you are, darling.
There you are.

39:13.434 --> 39:14.435
Scum.

39:16.229 --> 39:17.397
Death!

39:18.940 --> 39:19.983
Death!

39:20.942 --> 39:24.695
Death!

39:24.696 --> 39:28.116
Ezra ... what's that?

39:28.116 --> 39:29.617
Ezra?

39:45.758 --> 39:49.429
'The death of Maureen Selby
did not seem to affect Ez unduly.

39:50.013 --> 39:52.432
'He went on
as if nothing had happened,

39:52.599 --> 39:54.183
'except for one thing.

39:54.350 --> 39:57.228
'Now he began to seek
the companionship of women.

39:57.770 --> 40:02.191
'He started in strange places,
none stranger than Goldie's Tavern.'

40:04.110 --> 40:06.029
Her name was Mary Ransom.

40:06.195 --> 40:09.574
She was 34 years old and,
if truth were told, a little over the hill.

40:10.325 --> 40:12.577
But Ezra had never seen
a woman like her before.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.662
Beautiful, promiscuous,

40:14.829 --> 40:17.123
with a constant promise
of being available,

40:17.290 --> 40:19.083
even, perhaps, to him.

40:31.346 --> 40:33.181
Hi. What can I do for you tonight?

40:34.015 --> 40:36.643
Just a... a glass of milk.

40:36.809 --> 40:39.395
Well, this is a bar, babe,
not a nursery.

40:39.562 --> 40:42.398
We don't serve milk here.
We serve hard liquor.

40:43.232 --> 40:45.068
I... I don't drink.

40:45.234 --> 40:47.612
Oh, I see.
You came in for the fresh air.

40:48.863 --> 40:50.365
I came to see you.

40:52.909 --> 40:56.037
Oh. Why don't you be a nice guy?

40:56.245 --> 40:58.164
There's still a minimum, huh?
Order a drink.

40:58.790 --> 41:02.377
All right, if you tell me
what kind to get.

41:03.294 --> 41:07.215
Well, um,
how about a whisky sour?

41:07.423 --> 41:08.675
It's got a cherry in it.

41:09.384 --> 41:12.178
Er... you like 'em with cherries?

41:15.348 --> 41:21.813
OK, then, that's one, er...
whisky sour.

41:24.899 --> 41:26.484
That'll be 75.

41:31.114 --> 41:32.323
This is for you.

41:34.033 --> 41:36.077
Oh. Look, um...

41:38.162 --> 41:40.748
Well, look, are you sure
you can afford this?

41:42.500 --> 41:43.793
Well, thanks.

41:43.960 --> 41:47.296
I'll just put it in here...
for safekeeping.

41:49.048 --> 41:50.925
- What's your name?
- Mary.

41:56.139 --> 41:59.350
Hey, how'd you like to tear off
a piece of that, eh?

42:00.518 --> 42:03.855
Boy, if I had a chance,
I'd bang her brains out.

42:04.022 --> 42:05.606
Look at that ass.

42:06.607 --> 42:09.068
And look at them tits.
Both of them.

42:09.235 --> 42:13.406
I've seen tits and I've seen tits
from Portugal to Yokohama.

42:13.614 --> 42:17.869
And let me tell you,
those are tits with a capital "T".

42:18.786 --> 42:20.747
Ah, if I wasn't an old man,
goddamn it,

42:20.913 --> 42:24.042
I'd be into her pants so fast
it'd make your head swim.

42:25.209 --> 42:29.547
That's the trouble. You get old.
Can't get it up anymore.

42:29.714 --> 42:33.217
Just sit there looking at it
hanging limp as a turkey neck.

42:33.843 --> 42:35.261
Oh, hell With it.

42:35.428 --> 42:37.430
Life's a pain,
and God's a sadist.

42:37.597 --> 42:38.765
Here she comes.

42:41.476 --> 42:42.852
Here you go, babes.

42:43.019 --> 42:44.645
Good evening, my dear.

42:45.563 --> 42:46.689
Shove it.

42:47.315 --> 42:49.442
Come on, try it,
tell me how you like it.

42:57.492 --> 42:59.702
Yes'm. Real good.

42:59.869 --> 43:01.412
Go on, now. Drink it up.

43:06.209 --> 43:10.296
Mary, Mary ...

43:10.713 --> 43:12.590
Mary!

43:12.757 --> 43:13.841
Mary?

43:14.675 --> 43:15.718
Closing.

43:18.012 --> 43:20.556
Be on your way.
Come on, let me help you up.

43:20.973 --> 43:22.642
Come on.

43:22.642 --> 43:26.312
Come on.
Alley-cop. Attaboy.

43:27.146 --> 43:28.689
All right, this way.

43:32.318 --> 43:35.655
I... never drink.

43:36.447 --> 43:38.991
I'd never guess that, Ez.
OK, hold on.

43:40.326 --> 43:43.120
All right.

43:43.121 --> 43:45.206
And then up.

43:51.379 --> 43:55.633
OK. OK, that's it.
Just a second.

43:57.051 --> 44:00.221
Now, you need your hat on.
All right. Yeah, come on.

44:00.221 --> 44:04.142
Mary, could I ask you something?

44:04.308 --> 44:06.102
Mm-hmm. Yeah, sure.

44:07.687 --> 44:09.063
I'll get that.

44:09.230 --> 44:14.360
W-would you...
kiss me good night, please?

44:15.778 --> 44:17.989
- Kiss me good night.
- Come here.

44:19.866 --> 44:22.785
All right now? OK.

44:30.501 --> 44:33.087
'Night after night,
Ezra stood watch at the bar,

44:33.254 --> 44:35.965
'waiting for the opportunity
to be alone with Mary.

44:36.883 --> 44:44.883
'Then, one night ...'

46:08.266 --> 46:09.850
Hello there.

46:12.853 --> 46:15.648
- What seems to be the trouble?
- Oh, hello, Ez.

46:15.815 --> 46:20.027
Some goddamn putz
slashed my goddamn tyres!

46:20.027 --> 46:21.779
That's the trouble.
Can you believe it?

46:22.655 --> 46:26.367
Oh, boy. They sure do a job
on 'em, don't they?

46:27.243 --> 46:29.704
Yes, sir. You know,
kids are like that today.

46:30.246 --> 46:31.998
Just as dirty as they can be.

46:33.499 --> 46:36.252
Always doing dirty things
like that and carrying on.

46:37.211 --> 46:39.046
Just plain dirty,
no other word for it.

46:39.213 --> 46:43.259
Look, Ez, could you just give me a lift
down the filling station or something?

46:43.426 --> 46:46.637
- Why, sure...
- OK, thanks a lot. I really appreciate it.

46:46.804 --> 46:49.265
Sure, any little thing, Mary,
anything I can do.

46:52.351 --> 46:56.022
Hey, hey. You just took a wrong turn.
That's the way to town.

46:56.522 --> 46:58.774
Yes'm, it was.

46:59.275 --> 47:01.527
Well, just turn around
and go back.

47:02.528 --> 47:04.405
- How come?
- How come?

47:04.864 --> 47:07.074
Because that's where I have to go,
that's how come.

47:07.867 --> 47:09.452
Look, where do you think
you're going, anyway?

47:10.244 --> 47:12.955
- My place.
- Oh, the hell you are!

47:14.081 --> 47:17.126
Just... just turn this thing around
and stop this truck.

47:25.384 --> 47:28.929
I was just going to get
a couple of spares I got.

47:29.847 --> 47:31.265
I'll put 'em on your car
for nothing.

47:32.433 --> 47:34.101
Now, why would you want
to go to a mechanic

47:34.268 --> 47:35.478
when I'll go do it for nothing?

47:36.562 --> 47:39.065
He'll charge you an arm and a leg
and I won't charge you nothing.

47:44.528 --> 47:47.656
OK, but, er... look.

47:47.823 --> 47:49.909
You're a nice guy,
and I like you,

47:50.076 --> 47:51.702
but just er...
don't get any ideas.

47:51.869 --> 47:53.454
Just keep your hands
to yourself, OK?

47:54.413 --> 47:57.208
Yes'm. Cross my heart.

48:27.488 --> 48:28.906
Would you like to come in?

48:31.242 --> 48:32.410
How long do you plan to be?

48:33.285 --> 48:35.204
Oh, just a minute or two.

48:36.789 --> 48:39.458
I'll wait here.
Would you just hurry it up?

48:40.418 --> 48:41.585
Yes'm.

49:30.801 --> 49:33.387
Oh, Christ,
what a pain in the ass.

49:47.776 --> 49:49.236
Come on.

49:54.158 --> 49:55.784
Oh, shit.

50:36.242 --> 50:37.243
Ezra?

50:38.661 --> 50:40.162
Ez?

51:22.580 --> 51:26.083
Hey, hey, look, Ezra,
I really gotta be going home. It's...

51:35.718 --> 51:37.261
Ezra, are you down there?

51:57.948 --> 51:59.158
Ezra?

52:44.036 --> 52:45.079
Ezra?

52:54.421 --> 52:56.090
Ez, is that you?

53:51.812 --> 53:52.813
Mary!

54:00.571 --> 54:02.030
Mary!

54:33.312 --> 54:34.730
Mary?

54:42.738 --> 54:44.198
Mary.

54:47.451 --> 54:48.952
Mary, are you awake now?

54:54.708 --> 54:58.170
I'm sorry I had to look you
in the closet, Mary.

55:04.134 --> 55:05.928
I'm fixing the place up a bit.

55:08.472 --> 55:10.599
Getting everybody ready
to meet you.

55:11.975 --> 55:13.352
They're real happy.

55:14.853 --> 55:16.939
They think you're a fine girl.

55:21.985 --> 55:27.074
And they think you'll make me
a real fine wife.

55:34.873 --> 55:36.333
Mary?

55:39.211 --> 55:40.879
They want to meet you now.

55:52.224 --> 55:56.854
I'm sorry I had to, you know,
take your clothes off...

55:57.020 --> 56:04.319
but I... I didn't want you
to try and... run off.

56:20.961 --> 56:27.926
Can you... Can you get up,
or do you want me to help you?

56:39.521 --> 56:41.273
Don't be afraid. Come on.

56:42.774 --> 56:46.445
I'm not gonna hurt you, honest.

56:52.701 --> 56:56.121
Here we go now.
Come on, this way.

56:57.664 --> 57:01.126
They all want to meet you,
have a little something to eat.

57:02.210 --> 57:05.130
My mama says you can tell
a lot about someone

57:05.339 --> 57:06.965
by the way they eat.

57:08.300 --> 57:10.135
Here we are now.

57:11.803 --> 57:14.097
Go on. Go on.

57:27.027 --> 57:29.071
It's all set up for you.

57:31.281 --> 57:34.826
That's your place there
at the end.

57:35.702 --> 57:36.703
Go on.

57:37.913 --> 57:38.956
Go on.

57:42.501 --> 57:46.463
Won't you sit down,
please, ma'am?

57:53.845 --> 57:56.974
Mama, this is Mary Ransom.

58:00.519 --> 58:02.062
I think she likes you.

58:08.527 --> 58:10.654
Ain't nothing
to be afraid of, Mary.

58:12.364 --> 58:16.076
Shoot, we do all the things
we used to do.

58:17.327 --> 58:18.578
Why, the ladies here, ...

58:19.496 --> 58:21.957
...they play bridge out on the porch.

58:26.670 --> 58:28.630
We laugh and eat.

58:30.924 --> 58:33.051
There's practical considerations, too.

58:39.099 --> 58:40.642
They help me make things.

58:46.523 --> 58:47.566
See this?

58:59.036 --> 59:01.204
That ain't catgut.

59:15.844 --> 59:18.764
This part comes from right down here.

59:22.476 --> 59:23.602
See the drum?

59:27.397 --> 59:28.440
That's a belly drum.

59:35.989 --> 59:39.659
I'm just trying to show you
I got talents, too.

59:41.369 --> 59:44.414
I may not be handsome like some of them
other fellows you meet up there, but...

59:49.503 --> 59:52.923
You know, 10:1 says you'll feel
a lot better if you eat something.

59:53.465 --> 59:56.343
I would eat, but I can't.

59:57.719 --> 1:00:00.055
- How come?
- My hands.

1:00:00.972 --> 1:00:03.724
Oh.

1:00:03.725 --> 1:00:06.436
That's true, ain't it?

1:00:08.688 --> 1:00:16.279
But... but if I untie you,
you'll... you'll try something.

1:00:16.279 --> 1:00:18.115
No, I won't.

1:00:20.283 --> 1:00:21.368
I promise.

1:00:21.952 --> 1:00:22.953
Well ...

1:00:26.790 --> 1:00:31.920
Ez, that's not a very nice way
to treat your bride, is it?

1:00:33.088 --> 1:00:34.381
Ez, is it?

1:00:35.966 --> 1:00:36.967
Gosh.

1:00:39.344 --> 1:00:42.264
No, it sure ain't.

1:01:08.957 --> 1:01:10.333
I really love you, Mary.

1:01:12.836 --> 1:01:14.171
I love you, too, Ez.

1:01:15.672 --> 1:01:19.759
I knew you did.
I knew deep down you did.

1:01:21.094 --> 1:01:22.679
I'll do everything.

1:01:24.306 --> 1:01:27.017
You just ... just rest.

1:01:28.018 --> 1:01:29.644
Just sleep.

1:01:34.816 --> 1:01:37.027
Call me when you want something.

1:01:47.871 --> 1:01:50.832
You'll always ... be protected.

1:01:54.794 --> 1:01:57.214
I'll put you on a pedestal.

1:01:57.214 --> 1:02:01.968
Hurry, Ez. Ez, untie my hands,
so I can touch you, too.

1:02:20.487 --> 1:02:22.072
Mary.

1:02:55.105 --> 1:02:56.106
No.

1:02:59.609 --> 1:03:01.361
No!

1:03:03.530 --> 1:03:04.948
No!

1:03:06.366 --> 1:03:08.535
Mama! Mama!

1:03:57.125 --> 1:03:58.835
'The only clue left to the police

1:03:59.002 --> 1:04:00.879
'in the disappearance
of Mary Ransom

1:04:00.879 --> 1:04:04.090
'was her parked car
with the two rear tyres slashed.

1:04:04.090 --> 1:04:06.843
'Hardly astonishing, then,
that no one ever thought of Ezra Cobb

1:04:07.010 --> 1:04:09.763
'as a suspect
in the barmaid's disappearance.

1:04:09.929 --> 1:04:11.598
'If only they had.'

1:04:12.182 --> 1:04:14.684
Well, well, well, well,
well, well, well.

1:04:14.851 --> 1:04:17.645
Guess they ain't never gonna
stop talking about that.

1:04:17.645 --> 1:04:19.397
Talking about what?

1:04:19.397 --> 1:04:22.275
That ... that dang fool barmaid,
that Mary what's-her-name.

1:04:23.401 --> 1:04:26.613
Don't they know they ain't never
gonna find that girl now?

1:04:26.613 --> 1:04:29.449
Missing like that for that long,
they ought to know better.

1:04:30.784 --> 1:04:33.620
- She ain't missing.
- You got a theory, too.

1:04:34.621 --> 1:04:36.331
She ain't missing.

1:04:36.498 --> 1:04:38.666
- I got her.
- You got her?

1:04:38.666 --> 1:04:39.959
I got her.

1:04:39.959 --> 1:04:41.544
Ez, what do you mean,
you got her?

1:04:42.670 --> 1:04:44.047
Out at my place.

1:04:44.672 --> 1:04:47.634
Mama, Miss Johnson,
a lot of others, too.

1:04:47.634 --> 1:04:49.427
Ez, you cut out that kind of talk!

1:04:52.472 --> 1:04:54.474
I just didn't want you
to worry about her, that's all.

1:04:54.641 --> 1:04:55.975
I ain't worried about her.

1:04:57.727 --> 1:05:00.313
Besides that, there wouldn't be
nothing to worry about anyway

1:05:00.480 --> 1:05:02.315
if you had her,
that's for dang sure.

1:05:02.732 --> 1:05:04.984
You wouldn't know what to do with her
if she sat right down in your lap.

1:05:05.527 --> 1:05:07.362
Now, Ez, you cutout
that crazy talk.

1:05:07.904 --> 1:05:10.740
- I was only joking.
- It ain't very funny.

1:05:10.740 --> 1:05:13.118
You're gonna get yourself
locked up in the poky.

1:05:13.284 --> 1:05:15.078
Hello, Dad. I'm home.

1:05:16.287 --> 1:05:18.748
- Hi there, son. Afternoon, Sally.
- Hi, Mr Kootz.

1:05:18.957 --> 1:05:20.750
Hello, Ezra.
Do you know Sally?

1:05:21.376 --> 1:05:24.587
No, sir, sure don't.
Hello, Sally.

1:05:24.921 --> 1:05:27.215
- Hi.
- Listen, I'll be back in a minute.

1:05:27.382 --> 1:05:29.592
Sally here works down
at Anderson's hardware store.

1:05:29.592 --> 1:05:32.429
Gonna slip us a few free shells,
ain't you, Sally, huh?

1:05:32.429 --> 1:05:33.972
No, sir. I can't do that.

1:05:34.180 --> 1:05:36.516
You can sure give us
a little discount, can't you?

1:05:36.724 --> 1:05:40.520
- Sorry, I can't do that, either.
- Well, what am I gonna do?

1:05:40.812 --> 1:05:42.647
I mean, hunting season
starts next week.

1:05:42.897 --> 1:05:44.441
Ez, what am I gonna do?

1:05:44.441 --> 1:05:47.777
I gotta buy myself some shells,
I gotta get some traps,

1:05:47.777 --> 1:05:49.863
gotta get a whole bunch of gear.

1:05:49.863 --> 1:05:52.490
Actually, I wish they didn't sell
that stuff down there.

1:05:52.657 --> 1:05:53.992
I really don't like it.

1:05:54.284 --> 1:05:55.743
How come you don't like it?

1:05:56.453 --> 1:06:00.415
Well, you know, I just don't like
the idea of shooting animals

1:06:00.665 --> 1:06:01.958
and trapping them and...

1:06:02.125 --> 1:06:04.544
Aw, Sally's soft-hearted.

1:06:05.628 --> 1:06:09.674
- Aw, so is Ezra. Ain't you, Ez, huh?
- Yes, sir.

1:06:09.674 --> 1:06:12.844
You know, honey, if we didn't shoot 'em,
they'd just starve to death.

1:06:12.844 --> 1:06:14.596
Got to keep that balance,
you know?

1:06:14.596 --> 1:06:17.015
Don't you worry about them deer, Sally.
They don't feel nothing.

1:06:17.015 --> 1:06:18.725
I'll never believe that.

1:06:18.892 --> 1:06:20.977
Come on, Sal.
Let's get going.

1:06:21.144 --> 1:06:23.396
- OK, Mr Kootz.
- Bye, Sal. See you later, son.

1:06:23.396 --> 1:06:25.273
- See you, Dad.
- Bye.

1:06:56.346 --> 1:06:58.515
- Good day, Ezra.
- Hello, Ezra.

1:06:59.849 --> 1:07:01.226
Coming hunting with us today, Ez?

1:07:03.019 --> 1:07:04.479
Oh, no, I'm...

1:07:04.938 --> 1:07:06.773
I'm just gonna get
some antifreeze.

1:07:06.981 --> 1:07:09.317
We'll all need some
if we keep standing around out here.

1:07:13.696 --> 1:07:15.740
- Morning, Sally.
- Oh, good morning.

1:07:29.379 --> 1:07:32.465
Do I get my change,
or do I have to pay for that, too?

1:07:32.799 --> 1:07:36.135
I'm sorry. Thank you.

1:07:38.888 --> 1:07:40.306
Why did you do that, Brad?

1:07:42.183 --> 1:07:45.937
That is a beauty.
Hey, Ez, come over here. Have a look.

1:07:48.273 --> 1:07:51.651
Is that a beauty
or is that a beauty?

1:07:56.114 --> 1:07:57.657
Pow!

1:08:00.034 --> 1:08:02.453
Oh, Ez.

1:08:02.453 --> 1:08:04.539
You feel that.

1:08:04.747 --> 1:08:07.083
You just snuggle up to that, Ez.

1:08:14.841 --> 1:08:18.803
A fella could hit just about anything
that moves with that, wouldn't he?

1:08:26.853 --> 1:08:27.854
Yep.

1:08:29.606 --> 1:08:30.732
It's nice, all right.

1:08:32.233 --> 1:08:34.569
That's sure got to be
an understatement, I guess.

1:08:35.111 --> 1:08:37.864
The only thing wrong with you is
you don't know nothing about guns.

1:08:38.031 --> 1:08:40.074
'Cause if you did,
you'd sure see

1:08:40.074 --> 1:08:42.869
what a beautiful piece of work
this here thing is.

1:08:42.869 --> 1:08:45.246
Yes siree, it sure is that.

1:08:46.914 --> 1:08:48.249
Oh, yeah.

1:08:49.500 --> 1:08:52.295
Well, me and Brad better get
the hell out of here

1:08:52.295 --> 1:08:54.422
or all them damn deer
will be gone to Florida.

1:08:56.841 --> 1:08:59.218
- OK, will you stick those on the bill, Sal?
- Fine.

1:08:59.218 --> 1:09:00.887
- You got everything you need, son?
- Yeah.

1:09:00.887 --> 1:09:03.389
- Hey, Ez?
- Huh?

1:09:03.765 --> 1:09:05.099
You sure you won't come
with us now?

1:09:05.767 --> 1:09:08.144
- Where you going?
- Up east Old Landridge Road.

1:09:08.686 --> 1:09:09.979
Oh. No, thanks.

1:09:11.272 --> 1:09:12.815
Always had good luck
up there, Ez.

1:09:14.233 --> 1:09:15.526
No, I don't like that stuff.

1:09:17.862 --> 1:09:19.530
OK. So long.

1:09:19.530 --> 1:09:21.616
We'll be back later
to fill up the thermos.

1:09:21.616 --> 1:09:23.576
- See you later.
- All right. Bye-bye.

1:09:31.876 --> 1:09:35.505
Um, just the antifreeze?
Would you like anything else, Ezra?

1:09:44.347 --> 1:09:47.266
I was gonna look around.

1:09:47.642 --> 1:09:55.642
Oh, that's fine. Take your time.

1:11:52.975 --> 1:11:54.644
What are you doing, Ez?

1:12:52.660 --> 1:13:00.660
Stop.

1:14:07.234 --> 1:14:08.444
Brad!

1:14:08.444 --> 1:14:10.571
Brad, help me, please!

1:14:13.991 --> 1:14:16.577
Brad! Brad!

1:14:20.122 --> 1:14:22.458
Brad, help me.

1:14:22.667 --> 1:14:32.926
Brad.

1:14:32.927 --> 1:14:40.927
Brad, help.

1:16:57.696 --> 1:16:59.323
No!

1:17:00.241 --> 1:17:01.575
Help!

1:17:02.827 --> 1:17:05.079
No! No!

1:17:06.872 --> 1:17:09.625
Oh, no. Please, no.

1:17:11.252 --> 1:17:14.046
Please. Please, no.

1:18:00.968 --> 1:18:03.345
Hey,Dad!
Dad, come in here quick!

1:18:33.334 --> 1:18:34.627
We bought some stuff

1:18:34.793 --> 1:18:36.837
and then we went out
to the Old Landridge Road.

1:18:37.004 --> 1:18:42.051
Well, according to the register,
you and he were her last customers.

1:18:42.343 --> 1:18:44.094
- Us?
- Mm-hmm.

1:18:44.595 --> 1:18:46.430
- Ezra bought some antifreeze.
- Yeah!

1:18:46.639 --> 1:18:48.807
- Said he was gonna take it out to his...
- Who, Ezra Cobb?

1:18:49.016 --> 1:18:50.434
He was still here when we left.

1:18:50.643 --> 1:18:52.102
Daddy, I'll bet he did something.

1:18:52.311 --> 1:18:54.563
- I'll bet he did.
- Who, Ez? He wouldn't.

1:18:54.563 --> 1:18:58.317
- You know Ez wouldn't do nothing like this.
- He's crazy enough to do anything.

1:18:58.484 --> 1:19:01.070
I've known Ez for 25 years,
and I tell you, he could not do a thing...

1:19:01.278 --> 1:19:04.073
Suppose we all go out
to his place and take a look?

1:19:04.240 --> 1:19:06.784
- Yeah, let's go.
- Come on.

1:20:07.219 --> 1:20:08.512
Ezra!

1:20:09.013 --> 1:20:10.264
'Ezra!'

1:20:15.644 --> 1:20:18.897
The wages of sin is death.

1:20:22.985 --> 1:20:26.280
Do you know what God done then,
don't you, boy?

1:20:33.912 --> 1:20:35.581
He burned 'em in hell!

1:20:36.248 --> 1:20:38.792
Death! Death! Death!

1:20:40.919 --> 1:20:47.384
