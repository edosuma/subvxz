WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:02.633
- HEY, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

00:02.633 --> 00:04.067
- HEY.
- HELLO.

00:04.067 --> 00:05.967
- HI.
OH, HANK AND PAT, HI.

00:05.967 --> 00:08.167
- HI, DEBRA.
HI, RAY.

00:08.167 --> 00:09.733
- DIDN'T KNOW YOU GUYS
WERE IN TOWN.

00:09.733 --> 00:12.633
- YES, AMY AND ROBERT
ARE TAKING US SIGHTSEEING.

00:12.633 --> 00:14.600
- YEAH, I GOT TO SHOW THEM
THE BIG APPLE

00:14.600 --> 00:18.533
AND GET AWAY FROM MOM AND DAD
FOR FIVE HOURS.

00:18.533 --> 00:20.067
- WE GOT TO SEE
PETER'S APARTMENT

00:20.067 --> 00:21.067
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

00:21.067 --> 00:22.733
- OH, HOW'S PETER DOING?

00:22.733 --> 00:24.733
- HE'S DOING GREAT.

00:29.100 --> 00:30.800
- [whimpering]

00:30.800 --> 00:33.100
- MOM, WHAT'S WRONG?

00:33.100 --> 00:34.633
- I'M SORRY.

00:34.633 --> 00:38.300
IT'S JUST THAT PETER'S
REALLY NOT DOING GREAT.

00:38.300 --> 00:39.733
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

00:39.733 --> 00:40.933
- MOTHER'S CONCERNED

00:40.933 --> 00:42.600
BECAUSE PETER IS
AN UNKEMPT LAY-ABOUT

00:42.600 --> 00:44.533
WHO CONSTANTLY
DISAPPOINTS US.

00:44.533 --> 00:47.100
THAT'S ALL.

00:47.100 --> 00:49.600
- HE LOST THE LEASE
ON HIS COMIC BOOK STORE,

00:49.600 --> 00:52.333
AND NOW HE JUST SELLS EVERYTHING
OUT OF THAT APARTMENT,

00:52.333 --> 00:53.967
AND HE NEVER LEAVES.

00:53.967 --> 00:55.500
IT WAS ALMOST LUNCHTIME,

00:55.500 --> 00:59.400
AND HE WAS STILL
IN HIS GREEN LANTERN PAJAMAS.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.700
- WE HAD HOPED
THAT GETTING HIS OWN PLACE

01:04.700 --> 01:07.267
MIGHT MEAN THAT PETER
WOULD FIND A WIFE

01:07.267 --> 01:08.800
AND START A FAMILY.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.733
- POOR PETER.

01:10.733 --> 01:13.200
I JUST WISH HE COULD BE
AS HAPPY AS I AM.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.733
- OH, MAYBE HE JUST NEEDS
A LITTLE ADVICE,

01:15.733 --> 01:17.067
YOU KNOW, MAN TO MAN.

01:17.067 --> 01:20.267
- THAT IS A GREAT IDEA.

01:20.267 --> 01:23.867
RAY, MAYBE YOU COULD
GO OVER AND, YOU KNOW,

01:23.867 --> 01:25.333
TALK TO HIM.

01:27.833 --> 01:30.467
- ME?
WELL, ABOUT WHAT?

01:30.467 --> 01:32.133
- WELL, PERHAPS YOU COULD
ENCOURAGE HIM

01:32.133 --> 01:33.767
TO GET OUT THERE
AND MEET SOMEONE.

01:33.767 --> 01:37.067
- YES, WE ALL KNOW
HOW MUCH HE LOOKS UP TO YOU.

01:37.067 --> 01:38.500
HE'S OVER THERE
RIGHT NOW.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.433
- WELL, YOU KNOW, I WOULD,
BUT IT'S SUNDAY,

01:40.433 --> 01:44.200
AND I'M VERY BUSY WITH MY...
WORSHIP.

01:46.667 --> 01:49.367
- BUT PETER'S
RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

01:49.367 --> 01:53.267
I'M AFRAID HIS MANLY CHARMS
ARE STARTING TO FADE.

01:55.367 --> 01:57.267
I'M SURE THE LORD WOULDN'T MIND

01:57.267 --> 01:59.633
IF YOU WERE TO MISS
JUST ONE MASS

01:59.633 --> 02:03.333
IF YOU WERE TO SAVE
ONE OF HIS LOST LAMBS.

02:10.167 --> 02:13.133
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
I GUESS I CAN STOP BY

02:13.133 --> 02:14.933
ON MY WAY TO CHURCH.

02:14.933 --> 02:17.733
- THANK YOU, RAY.
- OKAY.

02:17.733 --> 02:21.567
- AND, ROBERT, WE STILL NEED YOU
TO BE OUR TOUR GUIDE.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.467
- OFF TO THE CITY.

02:25.467 --> 02:27.267
TIGHT GRIP
ON THAT PURSE, MOTHER.

02:29.500 --> 02:31.767
- MAYBE WHEN YOU'RE DONE
WITH PETER,

02:31.767 --> 02:33.700
YOU CAN HEAL A LEPER.

02:41.633 --> 02:43.800
- GREAT.
I GOT TO DO THIS NOW, RIGHT?

02:43.800 --> 02:44.967
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:44.967 --> 02:46.133
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL PETER

02:46.133 --> 02:47.600
TO COME OVER HERE
ON FRIDAY NIGHT?

02:47.600 --> 02:49.233
- NO, FRI--
WE DON'T WANT HIM OVER HERE.

02:49.233 --> 02:50.667
- YEAH.
NO, LISTEN.

02:50.667 --> 02:52.533
I'LL JUST INVITE
A BUNCH OF MY SINGLE FRIENDS,

02:52.533 --> 02:54.600
WE'LL HAVE A COCKTAIL PARTY,
AND I'LL MATCH HIM UP.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.933
- A COCKTAIL PARTY?
NO, NO, NO.

02:56.933 --> 02:59.800
I'M NOT PUTTING ON A TUXEDO
AND WALKING AROUND ALL NIGHT

02:59.800 --> 03:01.533
GOING, "CHEERIO, GUV'NOR."

03:01.533 --> 03:03.633
NO.

03:03.633 --> 03:04.800
FORGET IT.

03:04.800 --> 03:07.167
COCKTAIL PARTY.
YOU WANT A COCKTAIL PARTY?

03:07.167 --> 03:08.667
HAVE A COUPLE DRINKS,
AND WHEN I'M DONE,

03:08.667 --> 03:11.533
I'LL SWING BY,
AND MAYBE YOU'LL GET LUCKY.

03:14.233 --> 03:16.733
- MAYBE I'LL MEET SOMEBODY
AT THE PARTY.

03:20.767 --> 03:26.667
[rock music playing]

03:26.667 --> 03:28.067
[knocking]

03:28.067 --> 03:31.067
- RAY!

03:31.067 --> 03:32.567
HI!
- HI.

03:32.567 --> 03:35.333
HI, PETER.

03:35.333 --> 03:40.067
- WELCOME TO
"PETER'S APARTMENT OF COMICS"!

03:40.067 --> 03:41.733
- THANKS. THANKS.
HOW'S BUSINESS?

03:41.733 --> 03:43.900
- NOT GOOD.

03:43.900 --> 03:46.367
NO, MOST OF MY CUSTOMER BASE
IS STILL IN PENNSYLVANIA,

03:46.367 --> 03:50.600
AND THEY CAN'T GET THEIR MOMS
TO DRIVE 'EM HERE.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.433
I'M SO EXCITED YOU'RE HERE.
COME ON IN.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.067
- YEAH.
- THIS IS TERRIFIC.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.367
- WELL--YEAH, I CAN'T--
CAN'T STAY TOO LONG, YOU KNOW.

03:56.367 --> 03:57.633
ALLY'S GOT A THING,

03:57.633 --> 03:59.200
AND THE TWINS GOT
THIS OTHER THING.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.233
- OH, YEAH, HOW ARE
THE LITTLE NIPPERKINS?

04:01.233 --> 04:02.600
- GOOD. YEAH.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.233
YEAH. NO, THEY'RE GOOD.
THEY'RE GOOD.

04:04.233 --> 04:05.767
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

04:05.767 --> 04:08.067
YOU KNOW, HOW YOU LIKE IT
IN ROBERT'S OLD PLACE?

04:08.067 --> 04:10.900
- LOVE IT.
- GREAT.

04:10.900 --> 04:13.233
GREAT.
OKAY, GOOD.

04:13.233 --> 04:16.733
WELL, UH, SO HOW'S IT GOING
WITH THE LADIES?

04:16.733 --> 04:21.067
I MEAN, NOW THAT YOU GOT
THIS AWESOME BACHELOR PAD.

04:21.067 --> 04:22.067
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

04:22.067 --> 04:24.067
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, RAY,

04:24.067 --> 04:28.067
WHEN IT COMES TO THE LADIES,
I HAVE RATHER HIGH STANDARDS.

04:33.467 --> 04:34.467
- YOU DO?

04:34.467 --> 04:35.400
- YES, I DO.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.067
YOU SEE,
I'M A DC COMICS MAN,

04:38.067 --> 04:40.367
AND IF THE WOMAN
IS INTO MARVEL,

04:40.367 --> 04:42.067
WELL, THEN, IT'S "SEE YA."

04:42.067 --> 04:46.067
[chuckling]

04:46.067 --> 04:49.200
AH, WHO AM I KIDDING?
WOMEN HATE ME.

04:49.200 --> 04:50.500
- WHAT?
NO, NO.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.800
I'M SURE THEY DON'T
HATE YOU.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.567
I'M--I'M SURE THERE'S
A WOMAN OUT THERE

04:54.567 --> 04:57.167
WHO WILL APPRECIATE YOU
FOR WHO YOU ARE.

04:57.167 --> 04:59.100
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

04:59.100 --> 05:00.167
- YOU KNOW SOMETHING, RAY?

05:00.167 --> 05:01.667
WHEN I FIRST MOVED HERE,

05:01.667 --> 05:05.467
I SAID, "OKAY, I AM TIRED
OF BEING MR. LONELY JEANS."

05:05.467 --> 05:09.133
SO I WENT DOWN TO THAT BAR,
YOU KNOW, DOWN THE STREET,

05:09.133 --> 05:10.400
AND THERE WERE WOMEN THERE,

05:10.400 --> 05:13.367
AND I SAT FOR, LIKE, TWO HOURS.

05:13.367 --> 05:15.600
I FINALLY FORCE MYSELF
TO GO UP TO SOMEBODY

05:15.600 --> 05:18.133
AND SAY, "HEY, HOW YA DOIN'?"

05:18.133 --> 05:21.267
AND SHE SAID, "UM, FINE."

05:21.267 --> 05:24.333
AND THEN THE WOMAN
TURNED TO HER FRIENDS

05:24.333 --> 05:27.533
AND SAID,
"BUT I'M NOT DESPERATE."

05:30.267 --> 05:33.600
AND I JUST, YOU KNOW,
STOOD THERE WHILE THEY LAUGHED.

05:35.933 --> 05:38.600
AND THEN I JUST--
I WALKED HOME.

05:46.167 --> 05:48.333
- YOU WANT TO GO
TO A COCKTAIL PARTY?

05:54.067 --> 05:55.067
- WHAT?
- YEAH.

05:55.067 --> 05:56.367
THAT'S WHY I CAME BY,

05:56.367 --> 05:59.133
TO INVITE YOU
TO MY FUN COCKTAIL PARTY.

05:59.133 --> 06:00.933
- WELL, THAT'S NICE, RAY, BUT--
- NO, NO. LISTEN, LISTEN.

06:00.933 --> 06:02.267
PETER, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

06:02.267 --> 06:03.500
I UNDERSTAND.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.800
I COULD NEVER GET A GIRL,
EITHER.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.167
- OH, PLEASE.

06:07.167 --> 06:08.333
WE BOTH KNOW THAT'S CRAZY,

06:08.333 --> 06:12.067
YOU GOOD-LOOKING
SON OF A BITCH.

06:12.067 --> 06:13.300
- NO, I'M TELLING YOU.

06:13.300 --> 06:15.067
YOU JUST--YOU GOT TO JUST
KEEP TRYING.

06:15.067 --> 06:17.433
WHEN I SAW DEBRA
THE FIRST TIME,

06:17.433 --> 06:19.167
I WAS SCARED TO TALK TO HER,

06:19.167 --> 06:20.600
BUT I FORCED MYSELF

06:20.600 --> 06:23.700
JUST LIKE YOU DID
TO THE MEAN LADY IN THE BAR.

06:23.700 --> 06:25.067
ONLY, IN THIS CASE,

06:25.067 --> 06:27.333
I GOT TO MARRY THE MEAN LADY.

06:32.100 --> 06:38.233
[soft jazz music]

06:41.533 --> 06:42.733
- ALL RIGHT.

06:42.733 --> 06:44.433
HERE'S YOUR CLUB SODA.
YOU'RE ALL SET.

06:44.433 --> 06:46.767
- WHY COULDN'T YOU
JUST HIRE A BARTENDER?

06:46.767 --> 06:48.733
THE GIRL OVER THERE
WANTED A SINGAPORE SLING.

06:48.733 --> 06:50.200
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL THAT IS.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.633
I'M NOT ASIAN.

06:53.833 --> 06:56.200
- WELL, WOULD YOU RATHER
HAVE AMY'S JOB

06:56.200 --> 06:58.067
KEEPING MOM OCCUPIED
OVER THERE, HUH,

06:58.067 --> 07:00.833
WATCHING A THREE-HOUR
OPERA VIDEO?

07:00.833 --> 07:02.533
YEAH, I DIDN'T THINK SO,
ALL RIGHT?

07:02.533 --> 07:06.267
SO JUST MIX SOME DRINKS,
OR I'LL DEMOTE YOU TO COAT RACK.

07:10.667 --> 07:14.067
- I'LL BE MAKING YOU
A SALIVA COLADA.

07:17.633 --> 07:19.100
- UM, RAY?

07:19.100 --> 07:21.900
UH, WHO ARE THOSE WOMEN
YOU INVITED?

07:21.900 --> 07:24.067
- HM.

07:26.133 --> 07:28.333
THAT'S, UH...

07:28.333 --> 07:29.600
IT'S ANDY'S SISTER

07:29.600 --> 07:31.800
AND ROBERT'S FRIEND
FROM THE MORGUE.

07:31.800 --> 07:34.400
YEAH.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.767
WHAT?

07:35.767 --> 07:38.767
- IT'S--THEY JUST DON'T SEEM
VERY OUTGOING.

07:38.767 --> 07:41.967
- WELL, I CAN'T WAIT
FOR THE PARTY ANIMALS

07:41.967 --> 07:45.167
FROM YOUR BOOK CLUB
TO SHOW UP.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.967
- HELLO.

07:48.967 --> 07:51.200
- RAY, LOOK!
- YEAH.

07:51.200 --> 07:54.867
HOW ABOUT THAT?
NO MORE FREAKY-DEAKY.

07:54.867 --> 07:56.467
- HEY, PETER!

07:56.467 --> 07:58.833
OH, MY GOSH,
YOU LOOK SO...

07:58.833 --> 08:00.633
- NORMAL.

08:00.633 --> 08:01.767
- WELL, THANKS.

08:01.767 --> 08:03.567
YOU KNOW, RAY SUGGESTED
NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS,

08:03.567 --> 08:06.733
AND THAT KIND OF
GOT THE BALL ROLLING.

08:06.733 --> 08:10.067
- COME ON,
LET'S GET YOU A DRINK.

08:10.067 --> 08:12.600
HE WILL BE BACK
IN A MINUTE, LADIES.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.067
ROBERT, SET HIM UP.

08:14.067 --> 08:18.567
- OH, WELL, I THINK I WILL HAVE
A SLOE GIN FIZZ, BARKEEP.

08:24.400 --> 08:27.533
- YOU'LL HAVE A BEER.

08:27.533 --> 08:28.533
[knock at door]

08:28.533 --> 08:29.633
- THIS IS GREAT.

08:29.633 --> 08:31.867
WE GOT US
A LITTLE SHINDIG HERE.

08:31.867 --> 08:33.200

08:42.500 --> 08:44.100

08:44.100 --> 08:46.800
- WELL--WELL, SHE CAN'T.
WE HAVE PEOPLE.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.333
- YES, AND I INVITED HER.

08:52.200 --> 08:55.600
- HEY, RAY, UH,
ISN'T THAT THE COOKIE LADY,

08:55.600 --> 08:59.833
THE ONE WHO BEAT YOU UP?

08:59.833 --> 09:01.067
- YES!

09:01.067 --> 09:02.367
NO--I MEAN--IT'S HER,

09:02.367 --> 09:03.567
BUT SHE DIDN'T BEAT ME UP.

09:03.567 --> 09:04.667
- YEAH, RIGHT.

09:04.667 --> 09:06.233
DOESN'T DEBRA
KNOW THAT YOU HATE HER?

09:06.233 --> 09:07.900
- OF COURSE!

09:07.900 --> 09:10.667
- GOT TO LOVE DEBRA.

09:10.667 --> 09:12.533
- RAY, RAY.

09:12.533 --> 09:14.067
WHO IS THAT?
- NO, NO. NO.

09:14.067 --> 09:15.800
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.767
HEY, I WANTED TO YOU TO MEET
MY FRIEND LESLIE.

09:17.767 --> 09:19.767
- CAROL.
- CAROL. CAROL.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.400
YEAH,
CAROL'S MY BUDDY ANDY'S SISTER.

09:21.400 --> 09:22.667
YEAH, AND THE GOOD PART IS,

09:22.667 --> 09:24.400
SHE DOESN'T LOOK
ANYTHING LIKE ANDY.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.467
ALL RIGHT. LET'S HAVE A DRINK.
LET'S DRINK.

09:27.467 --> 09:29.900
- HEY, PETER, YOU KNOW,
PEGGY'S INTO SCIENCE FICTION.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.500
- WOW, REALLY?

09:31.500 --> 09:33.700
- WELL, I'M SURE CAROL'S
INTO SCIENCE FICTION TOO.

09:33.700 --> 09:35.967
SHE WEARS GLASSES.

09:35.967 --> 09:37.200
- EXCUSE ME.

09:37.200 --> 09:38.700
[clears throat]

09:38.700 --> 09:39.967
SO, UM...

09:39.967 --> 09:43.200
HI, YOU'RE A SCIENCEFICIONADO
AS WELL, HUH?

09:43.200 --> 09:44.400
- [laughs]

09:44.400 --> 09:46.533
YEAH, WELL,
MORE SO IN COLLEGE.

09:46.533 --> 09:48.433
BUT I DID JUST FINISH READING

09:48.433 --> 09:50.567
"DOUBLE STAR"
BY ROBERT HEINLEIN.

09:50.567 --> 09:51.600
DO YOU KNOW HIM?

09:54.900 --> 09:57.367
- I HAVE A STATUE OF HIM.

10:00.833 --> 10:02.500
- OH.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.933
WELL, I CERTAINLY
ENJOYED THE BOOK.

10:04.933 --> 10:06.200
I'M PEGGY.

10:06.200 --> 10:07.500
- OH, HI, I'M PETER.
- OH, HI.

10:07.500 --> 10:08.800
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.400
- OH, REALLY, THE PLEASURE
IS ALL MINE.

10:12.467 --> 10:14.767
- [growling]

10:18.433 --> 10:20.033
- SO WHY DON'T YOU TWO
SIT DOWN?

10:20.033 --> 10:22.267
- ALL RIGHT.
- WANT TO?

10:22.267 --> 10:23.733
- HEY!
HEY, WHY DID YOU INVITE HER?

10:23.733 --> 10:25.933
WHAT--WHAT IF THEY
START DATING, HUH?

10:25.933 --> 10:29.433
WE ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH
HORRIBLE PEOPLE IN THIS FAMILY.

10:30.633 --> 10:31.600
- WOULD YOU STOP?

10:31.600 --> 10:33.133
ROBERT, CAN YOU
GET PEGGY A DRINK?

10:33.133 --> 10:34.967
- OF COURSE.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.167
RAYMOND, YOUR BARTENDER'S
GONNA BE MIXING UP

10:37.167 --> 10:39.267
A LITTLE LOVE POTION.

10:39.267 --> 10:42.400
[ice cubes rattle]

10:48.600 --> 10:50.533
- OKAY, DON'T LET ME
INTERRUPT YOU TWO.

10:50.533 --> 10:53.600
THIS IS JUST SOME DEVILED EGGS,
YOU TWO DEVILS.

10:53.600 --> 10:56.033
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:56.033 --> 10:57.400
- WHAT?

10:57.400 --> 10:59.267
- YOU GOT A MILLION
SINGLE LOSER FRIENDS,

10:59.267 --> 11:02.500
AND YOU GOT TO INVITE
MY SWORN ENEMY?

11:02.500 --> 11:04.167
- JUST BECAUSE PEGGY'S
A STRONG WOMAN

11:04.167 --> 11:06.200
AND DOESN'T TAKE ANY CRAP--
GET OVER IT.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.600
AND BY THE WAY,

11:07.600 --> 11:09.200
THIS IS NOT
ABOUT WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.233
THIS IS ABOUT
WHAT IS BEST FOR PETER.

11:11.233 --> 11:12.667
- I KNOW.
I KNOW.

11:12.667 --> 11:14.333
AND WHAT'S BEST
FOR PETER IS NOT TO GO OUT

11:14.333 --> 11:17.800
WITH A SHE-BEAST
WHO ONCE TRIED TO BEAT ME UP!

11:17.800 --> 11:20.067
- RAY, I WAS THERE.

11:20.067 --> 11:21.567
SHE DID BEAT YOU UP.

11:24.733 --> 11:27.167
- VERY FUNNY.
THAT'S VERY FUNNY.

11:27.167 --> 11:28.533
GO ON, JUST SAY THAT
AND WALK IN THERE.

11:28.533 --> 11:30.333
YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST
WALK IN THERE.

11:30.333 --> 11:33.700
WELL, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN WALK IN THERE.

11:33.700 --> 11:35.967
- SO CAN I GET YOU TWO
ANYTHING ELSE?

11:35.967 --> 11:37.367
- DEBRA, THIS IS
THE FUNNIEST THING.

11:37.367 --> 11:39.333
WE JUST REALIZED
THAT WE WERE BOTH

11:39.333 --> 11:43.533
AT THE SAME SCIENCE FICTION
CONVENTION IN 1986.

11:43.533 --> 11:44.933
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I BET YOU SAW ME THERE.

11:44.933 --> 11:46.100
I WAS YODA.

11:46.100 --> 11:49.867
- [gasps]
I WAS PRINCESS LEIA!

11:49.867 --> 11:51.233
OH!

11:53.133 --> 11:55.233
- AH, LOOK AT THESE TWO, RAY.

11:55.233 --> 11:57.067
IT'S KISMET.

12:02.500 --> 12:05.100
- HELLO, DEARS.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.167
OH.

12:06.167 --> 12:08.567
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

12:08.567 --> 12:11.667
- HI.
THE OPERA TAPE BROKE.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.333
- MARIE, FRANK.
HI.

12:15.333 --> 12:17.100
- I'M SORRY, DEBRA.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.400
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU WERE HAVING A PARTY,

12:19.400 --> 12:22.100
BECAUSE I WASN'T INVITED.

12:22.100 --> 12:24.300
- YOU KNOW,
WE WANTED TO INVITE YOU,

12:24.300 --> 12:26.133
BUT WE DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS YOUR KIND OF PARTY.

12:26.133 --> 12:28.267
- I SEE BOOZE.

12:29.900 --> 12:31.300
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:31.300 --> 12:32.867
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TAKE A BOTTLE AND GO?

12:32.867 --> 12:36.100
HEY, RAY, GET 'EM A BOTTLE
OF ANYTHING THEY WANT.

12:36.100 --> 12:37.400
- OH, NO.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.067
I MEAN,
WHY CAN'T THEY STAY, DEBRA?

12:39.067 --> 12:40.900
HUH?
THEY'RE FUN PEOPLE.

12:40.900 --> 12:43.533
WHY CAN'T MY CHARMING PARENTS
SIT DOWN AND DELIGHT US

12:43.533 --> 12:46.733
WITH THEIR COMMENTS
AND OPINIONS?

12:49.500 --> 12:51.867
- LOOK, I'M SORRY,
BUT THIS PARTY IS KIND OF

12:51.867 --> 12:54.933
JUST FOR PEOPLE
WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A SPOUSE.

12:54.933 --> 12:56.600
- I'M IN.

13:06.700 --> 13:09.067
HELLO, LADIES.

13:09.067 --> 13:10.367
- THAT'S RIGHT, DAD,
THERE'S--

13:10.367 --> 13:11.967
THERE'S LOTS OF LADIES HERE,
YEAH.

13:11.967 --> 13:14.167
YOU KNOW,
WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN?

13:14.167 --> 13:16.933
SIT DOWN AND JUST TALK TO...
TALK TO PEOPLE.

13:16.933 --> 13:18.533
AND, YOU KNOW,

13:18.533 --> 13:21.767
DON'T BE AFRAID TO EAT EGGS
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

13:21.767 --> 13:24.367
- DEBRA, IS THIS
WHAT YOU'RE SERVING?

13:24.367 --> 13:27.633
OH, DON'T WORRY.
I'LL SAVE YOUR PARTY.

13:30.533 --> 13:32.933
- HEY, PETER,
YOU'RE ALL CLEANED UP.

13:32.933 --> 13:35.700
WHAT DID YOU DO,
JOIN A CULT?

13:37.433 --> 13:39.567
- WOW, DAD, THAT'S RUDE.

13:39.567 --> 13:43.067
DON'T YOU GOT ANYTHING
TO SAY TO PEGGY?

13:43.067 --> 13:44.633
- HEY, THE COOKIE LADY.

13:44.633 --> 13:45.967
A LITTLE MAKEUP.

13:45.967 --> 13:47.100
GOOD FOR YOU.

13:47.100 --> 13:48.667
- OH, BOY!

13:48.667 --> 13:51.467
DAD, THAT IS
EXTREMELY INAPPROPRIATE!

13:51.467 --> 13:53.467
I WOULDN'T BLAME PEGGY

13:53.467 --> 13:55.933
IF SHE JUST STORMED
OUT THE DOOR RIGHT NOW!

13:55.933 --> 13:57.600
- RAY!
- WHAT'S WITH HIM?

13:57.600 --> 13:59.900
- WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, STUPID?

13:59.900 --> 14:01.533
- [chuckling]

14:01.533 --> 14:02.833
- HEY, MA, MA,
WHY DON'T YOU COME IN HERE

14:02.833 --> 14:03.833
AND TALK TO EVERYBODY?

14:03.833 --> 14:04.867
- NO, NO, NO.

14:04.867 --> 14:06.233
MARIE, YOU JUST STAY IN THERE

14:06.233 --> 14:08.800
AND FIX MY BAD COOKING.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.433
- OKAY, DEAR.

14:10.433 --> 14:11.833
[doorbell]
- OOP, I GOT IT.

14:11.833 --> 14:15.467
NOBODY MOVE.
IT'S GOING SWIMMINGLY.

14:19.867 --> 14:22.067
- [yells]

14:22.067 --> 14:24.567
- HELLO, ROBERTO.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.800
- STEFANIA!

14:30.800 --> 14:33.700
- STEFANIA?
- WHA--

14:33.700 --> 14:35.600
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:35.600 --> 14:37.600
- IS TONIGHT
NOT THE PARTY?

14:37.600 --> 14:40.600
- NO, NO, IT--IT IS.
IT'S JUST...

14:40.600 --> 14:43.233
YOU'RE STEFANIA.

14:43.233 --> 14:46.733
- DON'T BE RUDE, ROBERT.
I INVITED HER.

14:46.733 --> 14:47.933
- BUT WHY HER?

14:47.933 --> 14:49.200
- WELL, WHY NOT HER?

14:49.200 --> 14:51.067
SHE'S NICE AND SINGLE.

14:51.067 --> 14:53.767
- BUT SHE'S MY STEFANIA.

14:53.767 --> 14:56.967
I MEAN...

14:56.967 --> 15:00.100
I MEAN, SHE'S MY EX-STEFANIA.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.400
NO, NO.
I MEAN--I--I--

15:02.400 --> 15:05.100
YOU'RE MY STEFANIA NOW.

15:09.633 --> 15:11.333
BABY.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.467
I NEED A DRINK.

15:18.467 --> 15:19.933
- COME ON IN.
LET ME TAKE YOUR COAT.

15:19.933 --> 15:22.433
- OH, GRAZIE.

15:25.067 --> 15:28.100
- I'M OUT OF HERE.
- ME TOO.

15:32.900 --> 15:35.700
- OKAY, BYE, LADIES.

15:35.700 --> 15:38.467
THANK YOU FOR COMING!

15:38.467 --> 15:42.800
- OH, STEFANIA,
WHAT A NICE SURPRISE.

15:42.800 --> 15:46.633
IT'S LIKE EVERYONE
WAS INVITED EXCEPT ME.

15:50.567 --> 15:53.267
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING,
INVITING HER HERE?

15:53.267 --> 15:54.700
- OH, I THOUGHT
PETER MIGHT LIKE HER.

15:54.700 --> 15:56.433
- OF COURSE HE'LL LIKE HER.
LOOK AT HER!

15:56.433 --> 15:59.433
NOT THAT I'M LOOKING.

16:04.767 --> 16:06.467
- IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT?

16:06.467 --> 16:09.133
- FROM WHERE I SIT, FANTASTIC.

16:11.533 --> 16:13.100
- EVERYTHING'S GREAT.
YEAH.

16:13.100 --> 16:14.567
WE'RE JUST
GETTING TO KNOW EVERYBODY.

16:14.567 --> 16:16.500
AND HERE,
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.333
PETER, I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO A FRIEND OF MINE, STEFANIA.

16:19.333 --> 16:21.900
YEAH, SHE'S FROM ITALY,
WHICH, INCIDENTALLY,

16:21.900 --> 16:25.433
IS THE LAND OF AMORE.

16:25.433 --> 16:26.400
- HELLO.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.133
- HI.
I'M PETER.

16:28.133 --> 16:31.333
IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU.

16:31.333 --> 16:35.633
SO WHAT OTHER SCI-FI WRITERS
ARE YOU INTO?

16:35.633 --> 16:37.067
- WELL, BRADBURY,
OF COURSE--

16:37.067 --> 16:39.200
- PETER, PETER, PETER.
- WHAT?

16:43.367 --> 16:46.200
- UH, RAY,
PEGGY AND PETER ARE TALKING.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.833
- YES. YES.
I KNOW, I KNOW.

16:47.833 --> 16:48.833
BUT PETER--

16:48.833 --> 16:50.067
- WHAT?

16:55.867 --> 16:58.833
- WE ARE TALKING.

16:58.833 --> 17:00.900
- PETER, DID YOU KNOW
THAT PEGGY BEAT ME UP ONCE?

17:00.900 --> 17:02.433
- RAY!

17:02.433 --> 17:04.767
- WHAT?
- YEAH, REAL BAD.

17:04.767 --> 17:06.600
- WILL YOU PLEASE
JUST GET OVER THAT?

17:06.600 --> 17:09.633
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
DID YOU SEE THAT?

17:09.633 --> 17:12.067
YOU GOT TO WATCH THE TEMPER
ON THAT ONE, PETER.

17:12.067 --> 17:13.400
- NO, YOU DON'T!

17:13.400 --> 17:15.200
LOOK, THEY GOT IN AN ARGUMENT
ONE TIME

17:15.200 --> 17:16.833
THAT WAS A LITTLE HEATED.

17:16.833 --> 17:20.067
- I THINK IT'S HILARIOUS
THAT YOU BEAT RAY UP,

17:20.067 --> 17:23.200
'CAUSE YOU'RE A GIRL.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.467
- WELL, LISTEN,
IT WASN'T EASY.

17:24.467 --> 17:26.867
AND RAY IS QUITE A GIRL HIMSELF.

17:26.867 --> 17:29.633
[laughter]

17:29.633 --> 17:32.600
- [uproarious laughter]

17:33.900 --> 17:35.567
YOU'RE A...

17:38.600 --> 17:40.867
- HEY, SHE'S FUNNY.
- NO, NO, NO.

17:40.867 --> 17:42.200
- LISTEN, ARE YOU FINISHED

17:42.200 --> 17:43.967
STICKING YOUR NOSE
INTO OUR CONVERSATION,

17:43.967 --> 17:45.200
OR DOES THAT THING
JUST GET STUCK

17:45.200 --> 17:46.200
IN EVERY CONVERSATION?

17:46.200 --> 17:49.667
[laughter]

17:52.800 --> 17:54.667
- ANYBODY WANT BRUSCHETTA?

17:54.667 --> 17:57.600
- PETER, I FORBID YOU
TO SEE THIS WOMAN.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.833
- RAY, WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?
WE'RE JUST HAVING FUN.

17:59.833 --> 18:01.567
- NO, NO.
SHE'S NOT FUN. SHE'S MEAN.

18:01.567 --> 18:03.600
AND I FORBID YOU
TO MARRY A MEAN LADY.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.133
- WAIT.
MARRY?

18:06.133 --> 18:07.367
- RAY, WOULD YOU STOP IT?

18:07.367 --> 18:09.567
- NO, I WILL NOT STOP IT, DEBRA.

18:09.567 --> 18:11.167
AND BY THE WAY,
THIS IS MY HOUSE,

18:11.167 --> 18:13.233
AND MY NOSE CAN GO
WHEREVER IT WANTS.

18:13.233 --> 18:16.100
HUH? HMM? HMM? HMM?

18:16.100 --> 18:17.733
- OKAY.

18:17.733 --> 18:19.967
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FINE.

18:19.967 --> 18:21.300
UH, I'M JUST GONNA GO.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.767
- OH, YOU SEE, DEBRA?

18:22.767 --> 18:25.867
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU LET PEOPLE GET HUNGRY.

18:25.867 --> 18:27.233
- PEGGY, PEGGY, WAIT.

18:27.233 --> 18:29.367
- NO, NO, LET HER GO.
GODSPEED, PEGGY!

18:29.367 --> 18:31.067
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

18:31.067 --> 18:33.133
YOU ARE RUINING THIS
FOR PETER.

18:33.133 --> 18:34.567
- I AM NOT.
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT PETER.

18:34.567 --> 18:36.567
YOU JUST WANT HER HERE
SO SHE CAN TORTURE ME,

18:36.567 --> 18:38.800
BECAUSE "SHE'S A STRONG LADY
WHO DOESN'T TAKE ANY CRAP."

18:38.800 --> 18:41.267
- NO, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

18:41.267 --> 18:42.867
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT?

18:42.867 --> 18:45.133
IN FACT, I WOULD LOVE IT
IF PEGGY AND PETER GOT MARRIED,

18:45.133 --> 18:48.167
'CAUSE I COULD USE ANOTHER
STRONG WOMAN AROUND HERE.

18:48.167 --> 18:52.067
- OH, I GET IT NOW.

18:52.067 --> 18:53.933
THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME.

18:53.933 --> 18:59.367
YOU WANT ANOTHER SOLDIER
IN THE FIGHT AGAINST YOUR ENEMY.

19:01.300 --> 19:03.467
- WHO'S THAT?

19:10.700 --> 19:13.233
- YOU ARE RUINING THIS
FOR PETER!

19:15.500 --> 19:17.300
- OKAY, THAT'S IT.
I'M JUST GONNA GO.

19:17.300 --> 19:19.067
- NO, NO, PEGGY,
PLEASE DON'T GO YET.

19:19.067 --> 19:20.167
- NO, LISTEN.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:20.167 --> 19:21.767
IT WAS REALLY NICE
TO MEET YOU,

19:21.767 --> 19:24.867
BUT I CAME HERE FOR A DRINK,
NOT AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE.

19:24.867 --> 19:28.333
BUT YOU HAVE ALL BEEN LOVELY.
GOOD NIGHT.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.367
- PEGGY, PEGGY, WAIT!
DON'T GO YET!

19:30.367 --> 19:32.567
PLEASE, PEGGY,
I'M NOT LIKE THESE PEOPLE!

19:32.567 --> 19:34.767
THEY'RE FREAKS!

19:37.167 --> 19:38.967
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

19:38.967 --> 19:40.733
- OH, DON'T GIVE ME THAT.
I JUST SAVED THIS MAN'S LIFE.

19:40.733 --> 19:42.667
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.
PEGGY WAS PERFECT FOR HIM.

19:42.667 --> 19:44.733
- NO, SHE WAS PERFECT FOR YOU.
- SHE WAS PERFECT FOR EVERYONE.

19:44.733 --> 19:48.233
- YOU SEE, PETER, THIS IS WHY
YOU DON'T GET MARRIED.

19:48.233 --> 19:49.900
- I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT, RAY.

19:49.900 --> 19:52.900
I GUESS I SHOULD PROBABLY JUST
LIVE THE REST OF MY LIFE ALONE.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.067
THANKS A LOT.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.067
- WELL...

19:55.067 --> 19:57.200
- YEAH. MM-HMM.
MM-HMM.

20:02.833 --> 20:07.600
- IT'S BAD ENOUGH
YOU RUINED MY LIFE,

20:07.600 --> 20:11.300
BUT YOU HAD TO DO THE SAME
TO MY BROTHER-IN-LAW?

20:11.300 --> 20:15.933
YOU ARE A SELFISH ASS

20:15.933 --> 20:19.300
WHO WALKS
AMONG REGULAR HUMANS.

20:19.300 --> 20:23.700
BUT NOW IT IS TIME
FOR EVERYONE TO SEE THE TRUTH

20:23.700 --> 20:27.033
THAT YOU ARE...

20:27.033 --> 20:29.433
ASS.

20:32.100 --> 20:35.267
[laughing]

20:38.833 --> 20:43.067
LISTEN, DON'T TELL AMY,
BUT STEFANIA'S HERE.

20:51.100 --> 20:52.767
[knocking]
