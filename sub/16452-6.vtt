00:00.010 --> 00:03.250
Seriously, I just need to get a couple
of things out of there.

00:03.280 --> 00:05.760
Can i just go in and...

00:05.770 --> 00:08.740
I just need, like, two things. Can i just grab?

00:08.760 --> 00:09.510
They're right there.

00:09.550 --> 00:11.910
I can see them they're right there.

00:14.310 --> 00:16.600
I don't understand why I can't go over.

The Closer
Season 03 Episode 06

00:41.110 --> 00:42.600
Okay. I got it.

00:42.610 --> 00:43.360
Okay?

00:43.390 --> 00:46.760
Make sure you get a
shot of the body over there.

01:06.570 --> 01:09.220
What took everybody so long?!

01:09.350 --> 01:12.300
911 received a call around 9:00 P.M.

01:12.320 --> 01:16.600
That some guy was getting strangled to death
in the Toyota section of the parking lot here.

01:16.630 --> 01:21.910
Now, you guys pop in about 30 minutes
after i find the victim's car!

01:21.940 --> 01:24.540
Excuse me, sir, where is the chief?

01:24.560 --> 01:26.680
Uh, she's right over there.

01:26.700 --> 01:29.110
I'd recognize those legs anywhere.

01:29.150 --> 01:32.180
Hey, she's not feeling well!

01:34.800 --> 01:36.460
Chief? Are you okay?

01:36.480 --> 01:37.360
No.

01:37.390 --> 01:38.800
I'm hot, and I have a fever,

01:38.810 --> 01:41.710
and the cold medicine I took
is making me dizzy and nauseated,

01:41.740 --> 01:44.210
and y'all are incredibly late.

01:45.560 --> 01:49.290
This is off of our victim, who
was garroted from behind.

01:49.290 --> 01:51.780
Lieutenant Provenza has
the murder weapon.

01:52.410 --> 01:53.250
Glen cooper.

01:53.260 --> 01:54.340
31.

01:54.360 --> 01:55.750
North hollywood address.

01:55.770 --> 01:58.420
Business card say she's
a personal trainer.

01:58.430 --> 01:59.610
There's over $50 in here.

01:59.630 --> 02:01.260
Okay, so it's not robbery.

02:01.270 --> 02:02.380
So why are we here?

02:02.390 --> 02:06.230
Robbery/homicide received five
new cases this weekend,

02:06.240 --> 02:08.199
so commander taylor
asked us to help him out.

02:08.210 --> 02:12.460
Now, if y'all could get
started on something

02:12.490 --> 02:16.020
and allow me to talk to sergeant
gabriel alone for a moment, please?

02:25.860 --> 02:28.120
So, you're mad at me, is that it?

02:28.140 --> 02:29.330
No.

02:29.340 --> 02:31.190
I'm... I'm confused.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.220
I called you and nobody answered.

02:33.230 --> 02:35.100
Do you see what I'm wearing here?

02:35.110 --> 02:37.690
Or did you not read the
schedule I gave you this morning?

02:37.710 --> 02:38.640
Where'd you put it?

02:38.670 --> 02:40.140
In your hand.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.810
Well, what was it? What'd it say?

02:41.840 --> 02:45.010
It saidthat we were completing weapons
of mass destruction training tonight,

02:45.030 --> 02:49.160
that our division deadline is
friday the 26th, two days from now.

02:49.570 --> 02:50.880
So that's all finished, then?

02:50.900 --> 02:52.110
No. No, we're not finished.

02:52.120 --> 02:56.130
We were 17 minutes short of finishing when
you apparently demanded that we be sent to you.

02:56.160 --> 02:59.710
Now the whole squad has to start the
training over again from the beginning.

02:59.720 --> 03:01.700
Why is this even necessary?

03:01.700 --> 03:05.740
Because the federal government gives us a subsidy
for each person that completes the training.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.450
So it's pope's budget stuff?

03:07.470 --> 03:09.510
Yes, it is.

03:12.920 --> 03:14.280
Shouldn't you be in bed?

03:14.310 --> 03:15.650
No.

03:15.890 --> 03:19.350
I should be having a word with the valet.

03:21.720 --> 03:23.540
L-I didn't see anything.

03:23.590 --> 03:26.280
I'm in and out of
cars all night, and I was 每

03:26.300 --> 03:30.370
I was in one when I pulled
around, and the officer, he 每

03:30.400 --> 03:33.600
he told me that some
guy got killed over there,

03:33.640 --> 03:37.110
and that, well, no cars could go
out, and that's not good.

03:37.140 --> 03:39.600
I mean, look... look at how
many angry customers.

03:39.610 --> 03:41.910
My uncle, he's gonna be really upset.

03:41.930 --> 03:42.840
Your uncle?

03:42.870 --> 03:44.730
Yeah. He owns the lot.

03:44.750 --> 03:49.010
I need to either bring people their
cars or give them their keys back.

03:49.050 --> 03:49.770
What is he doing?

03:49.800 --> 03:51.190
Is that how it's done here?

03:51.200 --> 03:54.450
You park people's cars, and then bring
them back or give them their keys?

03:54.460 --> 03:57.730
According to the
placement of the vehicle.

03:58.240 --> 03:59.290
What?! That... that's mine.

03:59.310 --> 04:01.670
The victim's keys were by his body.

04:01.690 --> 04:03.420
He was walking to his car

04:03.440 --> 04:07.270
when someone put a razor wire around
his neck and sawed through his jugular.

04:07.300 --> 04:08.840
And you saw nothing?

04:08.850 --> 04:10.140
No, no.

04:10.170 --> 04:11.410
I'm sorry.

04:11.420 --> 04:14.100
I must have been looking the
other way or something.

04:18.079 --> 04:20.510
Dr. Morales, I am so sorry I'm late.

04:20.540 --> 04:22.160
I wasn't feeling well.

04:22.780 --> 04:25.700
Oh, hi, Terrence.

04:25.750 --> 04:27.140
Sorry to hear you're sick.

04:27.160 --> 04:29.490
You want me to check you out?

04:31.170 --> 04:33.650
Sorry. That didn't sound right.

04:33.680 --> 04:36.760
Actually, doctor, I am
feeling a little weird,

04:36.780 --> 04:40.800
a-and the cold medicinel took seems to
be makin' my heart race. Is that normal?

04:40.820 --> 04:43.500
Okay, first, stay over there,

04:44.260 --> 04:46.160
'cause whatever you
have, I don't want it.

04:46.190 --> 04:47.250
Sorry.

04:47.250 --> 04:48.570
You want to know my symptoms?

04:48.580 --> 04:49.250
Do you have insurance?

04:49.270 --> 04:50.310
Yes, I do.

04:50.340 --> 04:51.400
Then see your own doctor.

04:51.410 --> 04:53.640
If you end up dying, I
promise to find out why.

04:55.150 --> 04:56.610
May I see you for a moment, please?

04:56.620 --> 04:59.190
Well, I'm just about to
head into an examination.

04:59.210 --> 05:01.210
Let me rephrase that rhetorical question.

05:01.230 --> 05:03.850
I want to speak with you... now.

05:08.840 --> 05:12.310
Sergeant gabriel just informed me you
pulled your squad out of wmd training.

05:12.330 --> 05:16.270
That's right, because murder takes precedent
over people walking aroundin hazmat suits.

05:16.280 --> 05:20.460
We seriously need the money the feds give us
for bringing your squad into wmd compliance.

05:20.470 --> 05:24.010
And I seriously need to find someone
who garrotes people in parking lots.

05:24.020 --> 05:25.860
Which is more important?

05:25.900 --> 05:31.410
Besides, you and I both know that my team isn't going
anywhere where those stupid hazmat suits are necessary.

05:31.430 --> 05:34.720
Priority homicide must be brought
up to wmd qualification.

05:34.730 --> 05:36.680
There is no way around that,

05:36.700 --> 05:38.630
so I've rescheduled the
training for tomorrow.

05:38.650 --> 05:39.870
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.

05:39.890 --> 05:41.660
What if I don't solve
the murder by then?

05:41.680 --> 05:42.830
No. No way.

05:42.850 --> 05:46.970
Or you can lose one member of your
squad permanently to counter terrorism.

05:47.560 --> 05:50.250
Why do you keep threatening me with that?

05:50.430 --> 05:52.180
And when I'm sick, too.

05:53.890 --> 05:56.360
She's a little spitfire, isn't she?

05:59.150 --> 06:01.680
The garrote killed him,

06:01.700 --> 06:05.930
but these marks on his
back look to be from a taser.

06:06.670 --> 06:09.040
Someone zapped your victo
take the fight out of him.

06:09.050 --> 06:10.210
Not a bad plan.

06:10.220 --> 06:11.910
Buff guy here.

06:12.150 --> 06:16.810
Also, Mr. Cooper had dinner less
than an hour before he was killed,

06:16.830 --> 06:18.700
maybe at an italian restaurant.

06:18.710 --> 06:20.530
Looks like pumpkin ravioli.

06:20.550 --> 06:22.930
I don't often find it this time of year.

06:22.950 --> 06:26.200
Some risotto, lots of bread.

06:26.210 --> 06:28.040
You sure this guy was
a fitness instructor?

06:28.060 --> 06:30.460
That's an awful lot of carbs.

06:31.460 --> 06:37.130
Also looks like he had at least a half a
bottle of red wine and a dozen raw oysters.

06:37.140 --> 06:39.400
Sounds romantic, doesn't it?

06:40.640 --> 06:44.450
Cooper's credit cards are maxed out, so he
didn't charge anything the night he was killed.

06:44.470 --> 06:46.000
But here's something interesting.

06:46.020 --> 06:49.760
Up until last week, he made
daily withdrawals of $500 每

06:49.780 --> 06:51.880
the maximum allowed with his atm card.

06:51.890 --> 06:55.610
According to my math, that's
almost $20,000 in cash.

06:55.630 --> 06:57.320
Why would he need that much money?

06:57.350 --> 06:58.420
Blackmail.

06:58.430 --> 06:59.980
Expensive drug habit.

07:00.820 --> 07:03.280
Any information on our 911 call?

07:03.300 --> 07:04.570
A recording's on the way.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.420
The owner of the phone, who
denies making the call,

07:07.440 --> 07:11.090
says that he was at a nearby restaurant
having dinner at the time of the murder.

07:11.090 --> 07:15.030
Three italian restaurants in the
vicinity of where mr. Muscles was found.

07:15.050 --> 07:16.890
Two serve raw oysters,

07:16.910 --> 07:19.850
but only one, il primo,

07:19.870 --> 07:23.730
had pumpkin ravioli on the
menu last night -a special.

07:23.750 --> 07:27.670
And a waiter recognized our
victim from his dmv photo.

07:27.700 --> 07:32.510
Said he had a hot blonde with
him, and the babe paid.

07:32.520 --> 07:35.810
Please, please hold your applause.

07:37.860 --> 07:41.790
A copy of the hot
blonde's credit-card receipt.

07:41.800 --> 07:45.560
Thank you, thank you very much.

07:46.570 --> 07:49.300
And the name on the credit card?

08:02.600 --> 08:03.860
- Tiffany lewis?
- Yes?

08:03.890 --> 08:05.820
I'm Deputy Chief Brenda
Leigh Johnson,L.A.P.D.,

08:05.840 --> 08:07.890
And this is Sergeant David Gabriel.

08:08.500 --> 08:13.890
Oh, payback from when I sent us an
the fireman stripper. Is that it?

08:13.910 --> 08:17.900
Actually, Mrs. Lewis, we're here
to talk to you about Glen cooper.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.420
Did you tell maria to
put the vodka in the freezer?

08:22.430 --> 08:23.760
Excuse me.

08:23.780 --> 08:24.870
What is it, honey?

08:24.880 --> 08:27.670
Did you tell maria to
put the vodka in the freezer?

08:27.690 --> 08:28.500
I did, bob.

08:28.520 --> 08:29.710
Aren't I a good girl?

08:29.720 --> 08:30.640
Who are they?

08:30.660 --> 08:33.970
Um... mormons.

08:34.280 --> 08:37.450
Remember, we're going
out to dinner tonight.

08:37.470 --> 08:39.520
I know. Very exciting.

08:41.159 --> 08:46.120
So, I take it that the oysters and red wine that
you had at il primo were not with your husband?

08:46.140 --> 08:48.170
I can't talk about this right now.

08:48.190 --> 08:50.350
Can you maybe just go away?

08:50.370 --> 08:51.170
Sure.

08:51.190 --> 08:54.230
As long as you promise to come
downtown to my office in, say, two hours.

08:54.250 --> 08:56.690
We can continue this in
a more private setting.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.060
I'm kind of busy right now.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.230
Or I can come back. It's your choice.

09:00.260 --> 09:05.450
Oh. What am I supposed to tell
my husband about where I'm going?

09:05.460 --> 09:08.590
Whatever you usually tell him, Mrs. Lewis.

09:22.750 --> 09:23.880
What now, mr. Howard?

09:23.890 --> 09:25.330
I'm sorry to bother you again.

09:25.340 --> 09:29.860
I need another E.T.A. On when you think
the doctor might be ready to see ms. Johnson.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.650
Any... moment.

09:31.670 --> 09:34.420
Just a little more patience, please, okay?

09:43.520 --> 09:44.830
Really soon.

09:44.890 --> 09:47.140
We have been waiting 45 minutes.

09:47.170 --> 09:49.180
That's why they call it a waiting room.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.250
Deputy chief johnson.

09:57.250 --> 09:58.520
Yes, sergeant.

09:59.590 --> 10:01.650
Oh. All right.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.450
I'll be there as soon as I can.

10:03.560 --> 10:04.580
Bye.

10:05.890 --> 10:08.410
Brenda, wait.

10:08.540 --> 10:09.900
Hey, hey.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.040
You're sick.

10:11.060 --> 10:13.130
I'm feelin' fine now,

10:13.150 --> 10:17.420
and I only have 24 hours to finish this
case before my squad has to play war games,

10:17.430 --> 10:19.710
and, honestly, it is just a little cold.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.360
You don't have a runny
nose. You don't have a cough.

10:21.380 --> 10:23.230
The cold medicine keeps
that from happening.

10:23.250 --> 10:25.250
Look, just don't worry.

10:25.280 --> 10:29.460
If I get another fever,
we'll... we'll see.

10:30.490 --> 10:32.150
I'll see you at home.

10:39.570 --> 10:40.580
Sir.

10:40.590 --> 10:42.690
Sir, you can't go back there!

10:56.960 --> 11:00.440
Uh, chief, tiffany
lewis'credit-card statements.

11:00.450 --> 11:03.540
I faxedglen cooper's picture to
the other restaurants where they ate,

11:03.550 --> 11:06.850
and last night's meal
wasn't their first dinner for two.

11:06.860 --> 11:11.690
Plus, there are several five-star
hotel charges, all here in town.

11:11.710 --> 11:13.280
Well, thank you.

11:15.520 --> 11:17.270
All right, then, mrs. Lewis.

11:17.290 --> 11:19.550
Okay, I admit it.

11:21.790 --> 11:23.630
You admit to what, exactly?

11:23.650 --> 11:25.510
I'm having an affair with glen.

11:25.520 --> 11:29.920
I know I shouldn't be, but I didn't
know that it was illegal in california.

11:29.940 --> 11:34.470
Honestly, I think that I'm being
picked on for some reason.

11:35.660 --> 11:41.630
Oh, mrs. Lewis, it isn't against
the law to, uh, have an affair.

11:41.670 --> 11:42.690
Really?

11:42.710 --> 11:43.650
Really.

11:43.670 --> 11:47.570
Oh, my god, you don't know how
you guys just scared me.

11:47.580 --> 11:49.890
I almost peed a little.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.180
You're not gonna tell my husband, are you?

11:52.210 --> 11:55.910
I mean, he has a temper, and I didn't
mean to start having an affair.

11:55.940 --> 11:57.330
It just happened.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.350
And then it kept happening.

11:59.360 --> 12:03.550
I think it's because guys just
want to have sex with me, damn it.

12:03.570 --> 12:07.870
As long as you completely cooperate, I
see no reason to inform your husband.

12:07.870 --> 12:09.490
Thank god.

12:09.510 --> 12:12.270
Our prenup's really bad for me.

12:12.270 --> 12:14.880
When you and mr. Cooper were
leaving the restaurant last night,

12:14.890 --> 12:16.910
did you notice anything suspicious?

12:16.920 --> 12:19.190
Oh, I wouldn't know.

12:19.210 --> 12:20.630
Let me think.

12:20.650 --> 12:23.540
We left the restaurant, he
walked me to my car,

12:23.550 --> 12:26.650
he kissed me good night, and I went home.

12:26.670 --> 12:28.130
Seems normal.

12:28.380 --> 12:29.760
You didn't valet your car?

12:29.780 --> 12:34.320
Last time I valeted my car, the
attendant guy stole my pot,

12:34.340 --> 12:37.390
so I don't valet anymore.

12:37.700 --> 12:40.890
Are you sure your husband didn't
know about your affair?

12:40.920 --> 12:42.050
Oh, no.

12:42.060 --> 12:46.980
If he knew that glen and i were screwin'
around, bob would be just furious.

12:46.990 --> 12:49.360
Why are you so interested in all of this?

12:49.390 --> 12:51.540
Well, I'm sorry to tell you this, tiffany,

12:51.570 --> 12:56.430
but, um, last night, glen cooper was murdered in
a parking lot outside the restaurant where 每

12:56.450 --> 12:57.770
murdered?

12:57.790 --> 12:59.620
You mean like...

12:59.630 --> 13:02.240
somebody killed him?

13:02.260 --> 13:03.260
Yes.

13:03.290 --> 13:04.160
I'm so sorry.

13:04.190 --> 13:07.830
No, there... there
must be a mistake.

13:07.840 --> 13:09.160
That's wrong!

13:09.180 --> 13:11.070
We're very sorry, mrs. Lewis.

13:11.110 --> 13:13.440
Oh. Oh, my god!

13:13.480 --> 13:15.670
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

13:15.690 --> 13:17.120
Oh, my god!

13:17.140 --> 13:18.790
Oh, no!

13:19.560 --> 13:21.260
Oh, my god!

13:22.070 --> 13:23.910
Oh, no.

13:27.250 --> 13:29.250
Chief, we got confirmation
that, during the murder,

13:29.270 --> 13:34.570
when the 911 call was made, the owner of this cellphone
was sitting at the chef's table of chez bohemia.

13:34.590 --> 13:35.960
He claims his cellphonewas in his car 每

13:35.960 --> 13:37.640
the same lot where the body was found.

13:37.660 --> 13:38.630
*****

13:38.650 --> 13:41.820
Only one other person had access to
that phone during the time of the murder.

13:41.840 --> 13:44.150
Our valet parker, kenny woods.

13:44.170 --> 13:46.890
I just dumped him in
the interview room with provenza.

13:46.930 --> 13:47.800
So, what'd I miss?

13:47.830 --> 13:51.930
Hot, married girlfriend of
the victim named tiffany.

13:51.940 --> 13:53.080
I think she wanted me.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.980
Thank you, detective sanchez, for
keeping us up to date.

13:55.990 --> 13:58.940
Perhaps you can find out
where tiffany's husband was last night

13:58.960 --> 14:01.310
and what he was doing
during the time of the murder?

14:01.320 --> 14:03.310
More about mr. Woods, please.

14:03.330 --> 14:07.430
Okay, I spoke to mr. Lang, the owner
of the parking lot where kenny works,

14:07.450 --> 14:10.150
and when I asked him about
the toyota section,

14:10.160 --> 14:14.610
which is where the 911 caller said someone
was being murdered, mr. Lang laughed.

14:14.630 --> 14:18.440
He said the only one who has a
toyota section is his nephew kenny.

14:18.460 --> 14:22.320
He also says that kenny
has obsessive-compulsive disorder,

14:22.340 --> 14:25.260
which is a fancy way of
saying he's a control freak.

14:25.290 --> 14:27.090
Now, he takes some medication for it.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.540
I could find out the name if you'd like.

14:30.080 --> 14:32.380
No, thanks, lieutenant.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.470
Does mr. Woods have a previous
relationship with the L.A.P. D?

14:35.500 --> 14:39.640
Seems our valet doesn't like it when people
pull out ofhis parking lot the wrong way,

14:39.660 --> 14:41.000
whatever the hell that means.

14:41.020 --> 14:44.870
L.A.P.D. Picked him up for two
little dust-ups with some customers.

14:44.890 --> 14:47.920
And our little weirdo is
sticking to his story.

14:47.950 --> 14:51.820
Well, then, I'll have to make his stay
here very welcoming, then, won't I?

14:51.880 --> 14:53.240
Thank you, lieutenant.

14:53.270 --> 14:55.140
911,what is your emergency?

14:55.150 --> 15:01.170
I just saw some-body strangle somebody in
the... the toyota section of the parking lot.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.520
And what is your location, sir?

15:02.540 --> 15:04.890
Lang's valet, e-east of grand.

15:04.910 --> 15:06.580
Emergency
vehicles are on...

15:06.600 --> 15:09.980
there are more than a few similarities
between this caller and you, kenny.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.740
He reports a man being murdered in
the toyota section of your parking lot,

15:13.750 --> 15:16.340
and you made the call on this cellphone,

15:16.360 --> 15:19.150
which happened to be locked in
one of the cars you valeted.

15:19.170 --> 15:22.500
I... l-I didn't...
I didn't make any call.

15:22.500 --> 15:25.180
The caller also stammers.

15:25.190 --> 15:26.160
I...

15:27.620 --> 15:29.630
I didn't make any call.

15:29.650 --> 15:34.110
These are the fingerprints that were found
on the cellphone that made the 911 call.

15:34.120 --> 15:35.600
And these are your fingerprints.

15:35.610 --> 15:37.050
They match.

15:37.160 --> 15:39.630
Maybe the phone was on
the seat and I moved it.

15:39.650 --> 15:42.180
Ah, you've got a bit of a
temper, don't you, kenny boy?

15:42.200 --> 15:47.230
Rap sheet says here that you've been picked up
twice for some pretty nasty arguments with customers.

15:47.240 --> 15:49.440
I do nothave
a-a-a temper!

15:49.450 --> 15:54.450
It's just there's a certain way that
cars need to be put in and brought out,

15:54.470 --> 15:59.050
and other people, they don't always
understand the challenges of valet parking!

15:59.080 --> 16:02.340
Did the man who had his throatcut in your
lot last night not understand those challenges?

16:02.360 --> 16:03.730
Did you two argue?

16:03.750 --> 16:05.210
What? No!

16:05.230 --> 16:08.010
Seriously, why...
why would you think such things about me?

16:08.050 --> 16:10.070
Because you're not
tellin' me the truth, kenny!

16:10.090 --> 16:11.300
And I have to consider why,

16:11.320 --> 16:13.500
and one possibility is
that you killed mr. Cooper

16:13.520 --> 16:15.590
because he interfered with
the way you ran the lot.

16:15.610 --> 16:18.260
I made the call, okay?

16:18.290 --> 16:21.210
But I didn't... I
didn't kill him!

16:21.760 --> 16:25.360
I'm not saying anything
else until after I floss.

16:25.370 --> 16:27.420
L-I can't... I can't
say anything else.

16:27.430 --> 16:29.700
I need to...
I need to brush my teeth and floss.

16:29.720 --> 16:30.820
Why can't you say anything else?

16:30.860 --> 16:32.500
You made the call.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.250
You saw glen cooper die.

16:34.280 --> 16:35.280
Did you see the killer, too?

16:35.300 --> 16:37.740
- Were you threatened in some way?
- No.

16:37.760 --> 16:42.350
Mr. Cooper was attacked, so you grabbed a
set of keys and you locked yourself in a car.

16:42.380 --> 16:44.400
And the killer threatened
you as you drove away.

16:44.420 --> 16:45.130
Is that it?

16:45.150 --> 16:46.340
Can you identify him?

16:46.340 --> 16:47.430
No.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.970
No, no, no.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.240
I'm...
I'm sorry.

16:54.310 --> 16:56.280
Can I just
- just park cars?

16:56.320 --> 16:58.980
- The answer to that, kenny, is yes.
- Okay.

16:59.010 --> 17:01.730
I can't compel you to tell me anything.

17:03.870 --> 17:05.859
Just remember one thing 每

17:06.900 --> 17:09.460
killers don't like leaving
eyewitnesses around,

17:09.480 --> 17:12.140
especially ones who've
been talking to the police.

17:12.450 --> 17:15.069
So you be careful in
your parking lot tonight.

17:15.579 --> 17:16.680
Wait.

17:16.740 --> 17:17.900
Don't you have to protect me?

17:17.930 --> 17:19.230
- From who?
- From that guy!

17:19.260 --> 17:20.790
So we're looking for a man?

17:20.810 --> 17:21.940
What did he look like, kenny?

17:21.960 --> 17:24.010
How big was he? How old?

17:24.030 --> 17:27.490
No, no, no, no, no.

17:27.530 --> 17:28.700
No.

17:29.710 --> 17:32.300
He will kill me if I talk.

17:32.340 --> 17:33.630
Oh, my god.

17:33.700 --> 17:38.270
Oh! Oh. Look, um...

17:39.110 --> 17:43.960
I think...
I think I'd rather just stay here tonight.

17:44.330 --> 17:45.820
Please.

17:47.290 --> 17:49.150
I'll see if I can pull some strings.

17:49.160 --> 17:52.790
Oh. Oh, my god.

17:53.710 --> 17:55.060
Thank you.

18:05.630 --> 18:07.850
I know I should've
rescheduled with the doctor,

18:07.860 --> 18:10.590
but I think I figured
out what's going on here.

18:11.310 --> 18:13.580
Palpitations, fever, feeling
faint...

18:13.600 --> 18:15.790
you have a diagnosisthat
covers all that?

18:17.270 --> 18:20.220
Cold medicine plus stress.

18:22.110 --> 18:23.290
Okay.

18:23.550 --> 18:25.190
Lowering your pressure
at work couldn't hurt,

18:25.210 --> 18:28.980
but you still have to see a doctor
because I don't think stress causes fevers.

18:28.990 --> 18:30.860
That's from the cold, which
is on its way out.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.120
I can tell.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.680
So...

18:40.290 --> 18:42.410
let's talk about the anxiety.

18:42.480 --> 18:43.650
You deal with murders all the time,

18:43.670 --> 18:47.550
and it doesn't usually get
you this stressed out,

18:47.580 --> 18:50.290
so... what's up?

18:51.140 --> 18:52.550
Budget issues.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.110
Pope's
makin'...

18:54.140 --> 18:59.740
he's makin' my squad go through weapons of mass
destruction training for some federal subsidies.

18:59.760 --> 19:02.870
Eight hours in
thoseridiculous hazmat suits.

19:02.890 --> 19:07.830
Startin' tomorrow, they're all gonna be
runnin' around some potential terrorist target,

19:07.840 --> 19:11.110
leavin' me to solve this
murder completely on my own...

19:11.130 --> 19:15.730
with provenza, who I
guess is too old for wmd.

19:16.180 --> 19:19.980
It's just...
you see how upsettin' that is?

19:20.000 --> 19:21.030
Do you see it?

19:21.060 --> 19:22.130
Right.

19:22.150 --> 19:23.240
Okay.

19:23.250 --> 19:26.530
You know, I think I know a
way you can work the murder

19:26.570 --> 19:29.250
and keep your whole
tea mall in the same place.

19:30.790 --> 19:33.640
The floor of this building is not
a proper place for wmd training.

19:33.660 --> 19:38.340
Oh, well, according to your qualification
manual, which is whatl'm going by,

19:38.350 --> 19:41.130
"any emergency trainingto
be completed by said group"

19:41.160 --> 19:44.340
may be conducted in anyand all
government-owned"and operated venues,

19:44.350 --> 19:48.130
not excluding those which might themselves
be targets in a terrorist attack."

19:48.180 --> 19:49.950
That sounds like parker center to me.

19:50.020 --> 19:51.910
You're deliberately misinterpreting
the text.

19:51.920 --> 19:56.170
Just so you know, for the next7 hours
and 38 minutes, this squad is mine.

19:56.170 --> 20:01.000
That headgear comes off, if I see one person's
face, even a fingernail, no qualification.

20:01.080 --> 20:02.900
And at some point, we
have to rescue someone.

20:02.970 --> 20:03.940
I'll leave when up to you.

20:03.950 --> 20:05.250
Chief, don't worry.

20:05.260 --> 20:07.290
I'm gonna take the lead here.

20:07.310 --> 20:08.790
We're good.

20:09.690 --> 20:13.040
Mr. Cox, I am happy to
help youin any way I can.

20:13.060 --> 20:16.720
I could do that more effectively if
I could talk to my squad.

20:16.740 --> 20:18.310
Oh. Use this.

20:18.320 --> 20:19.870
They're on channel 4.

20:20.540 --> 20:25.670
Really, making me use that radiosystem...
it complicates my job.

20:25.690 --> 20:27.080
And what about my job?!

20:27.100 --> 20:29.740
Which is to ensure this squadknows what
measures to take in the event of, say 每

20:29.760 --> 20:31.580
I don'tknow...
a nuclear disaster.

20:31.600 --> 20:35.060
Sir, this is a
homicide division, not a bomb squad.

20:35.080 --> 20:38.690
Well, according to the
paperwork l have, it's both.

20:40.850 --> 20:42.340
What paperwork?

20:42.860 --> 20:45.890
What is he talking...
what is he talking about?!

20:48.150 --> 20:49.980
What is he talking about?

20:50.020 --> 20:53.270
We just needto finish training.

20:53.280 --> 20:55.090
Chief! I checked
into tiffany...

20:55.110 --> 20:58.100
detective sanchez, use
your inside voice, please.

20:58.130 --> 20:59.180
Sorry.

20:59.580 --> 21:01.520
I checked into tiffany's husband, bob.

21:01.550 --> 21:04.520
The night before last,
he has an alibi... out to dinner.

21:04.540 --> 21:06.230
And I looked into his finances.

21:06.240 --> 21:11.110
He's an efficiency expert with a
highly successful consulting firm.

21:11.120 --> 21:14.140
And his prenup with
tiffany... watertight.

21:14.170 --> 21:17.250
I did a phone dump on
lewis' landlines and cellphones...

21:17.270 --> 21:19.180
calls from mrs. Lewis to glen cooper,

21:19.190 --> 21:23.780
but nothing out of the ordinary like
private detectives or divorce attorneys.

21:23.820 --> 21:27.460
If tiffany charged her affairon
their joint credit cards,

21:27.480 --> 21:29.160
it's all over their statements.

21:29.200 --> 21:33.360
Lieutenant tao, could you please
check mr. Lewis' office lines?

21:33.390 --> 21:34.220
Thank you.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.840
- And, uh, lieutenant provenza...
- yeah.

21:36.860 --> 21:39.560
Lieutenant provenza, how's our
parking attendant doing?

21:39.580 --> 21:40.940
Oh, he's still here.

21:40.970 --> 21:43.470
Robbery/homicide's watching him for us.

21:44.570 --> 21:50.370
Look, alibi or not... alibi or not,
I think that we should have mr. Lewis,

21:50.380 --> 21:52.860
tiffany's husband, pop in for a visit.

21:52.880 --> 21:55.250
But I can't send any
of youto go pick him up,

21:55.280 --> 21:57.690
and I can't sendlieutenant
provenza by himself.

21:57.730 --> 22:00.370
Oh, this is a nightmare!

22:03.220 --> 22:09.820
Sergeant gabriel, what did mr. Cox mean
when he says, according to his paperwork,

22:09.840 --> 22:13.390
y'all are priority
homicide and a bomb squad?

22:14.280 --> 22:15.460
Okay.

22:15.490 --> 22:17.240
Chief, now, don't get mad.

22:18.520 --> 22:23.200
My entire division is officially part of
the L.A.P.D.'S counter terrorism bureau?

22:24.110 --> 22:25.560
Well, not provenza.

22:25.610 --> 22:27.500
When were you gonna tell me about this?

22:27.530 --> 22:29.280
Look, l-it's onlya paper change.

22:29.300 --> 22:31.550
It's so minor, I didn't
think you'd notice.

22:31.550 --> 22:35.610
There are five people walkin' around
my murder room in noisy, plastic suits.

22:35.630 --> 22:37.610
How could I not notice?

22:37.670 --> 22:40.650
You know, honestly, when sergeant
gabriel came up with the idea

22:40.670 --> 22:44.410
for these transfers to save
your section from budget cuts,

22:44.430 --> 22:45.810
by the way, I thought
you'd be happy...

22:45.830 --> 22:48.810
- what are you doing?
- I'm dizzy, and my heart's pounding.

22:49.530 --> 22:52.510
It only happens whenl
get really, really mad.

22:52.850 --> 22:55.160
I thought it was a
reactionto my cold medicine.

22:55.180 --> 22:57.540
Did we establish that
you actually have a cold?

22:57.570 --> 22:59.330
I've been gettin' fevers.

22:59.340 --> 23:00.250
I don't know.

23:00.270 --> 23:02.450
Have you considered seeing a doctor?

23:03.170 --> 23:05.370
And when do I have time to do that, will?

23:05.420 --> 23:08.850
If lieutenant provenza and i are
the entire priority homicide division

23:08.860 --> 23:12.090
and I have todo everything myself without
any help from anybody and budget cuts 每

23:12.110 --> 23:15.270
- don't over react.
- And I'm not overreacting!

23:15.290 --> 23:17.000
Uh, excuse me. Is this a bad time?

23:17.030 --> 23:19.130
No, chief johnson was just leaving.

23:19.150 --> 23:22.590
Actually, it was her who
I came to speak to.

23:22.610 --> 23:24.970
I've been watching this
kenny, your valet guy.

23:24.990 --> 23:29.760
We just pulled in this bob lewis character, who
sergeant gabriel asked me to pick up.

23:29.780 --> 23:33.220
I was wondering what you want
us to do with the two of them.

23:33.230 --> 23:36.100
Thank you, commander, for all your help.

23:36.120 --> 23:42.670
If you could please make sure that kenny woods makes
it into the electronics room with lieutenant provenza

23:42.680 --> 23:47.800
and set up mr. Lewisin one of our
interview rooms, that would be very helpful.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.070
Excuse me.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.540
Why am I here?

23:58.560 --> 24:00.340
Do I need to have my lawyer meet me?

24:00.360 --> 24:05.430
Well, um, if you really think that waitin 'for
legal representation's the best use of your time,

24:05.460 --> 24:07.370
mr. Lewis, we could certainly do that,

24:07.390 --> 24:10.130
but knowin' that, uh, you're
an efficiency expert,

24:10.150 --> 24:12.930
I wrote down all the
questions that I wanted to ask you.

24:12.960 --> 24:17.460
I thought maybe that you could look them over and
decide about whether or not you wanted a lawyer.

24:17.490 --> 24:21.320
Let's just get this over with.

24:22.810 --> 24:25.190
"Where were..."

24:26.100 --> 24:30.280
uh,"where were youthe
night before last?"

24:30.330 --> 24:32.640
That's wednesday, the 24th.

24:33.860 --> 24:36.520
Business dinnerat mastro'S.

24:36.560 --> 24:41.230
You want further details, I'll
have my assistant e-mail you, okay?

24:41.250 --> 24:46.390
"Do you... harm the war?"

24:46.410 --> 24:47.820
You're kidding, right?

24:48.330 --> 24:50.990
"Do you know this man?"

24:51.500 --> 24:52.940
What man?

24:53.000 --> 24:54.540
Oh, sorry.

24:56.410 --> 24:58.000
Here. This man.

24:58.030 --> 25:02.350
Oh, yeah, that's my wife's fitness
trainer, jeff or chuck or something.

25:02.380 --> 25:03.900
Actually, his name is glen cooper.

25:03.920 --> 25:04.990
Oh. That's right. Glen.

25:05.010 --> 25:09.850
And he was found dead the night of the 24th
outside il primo, a restaurant downtown.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.920
That's too bad.

25:12.960 --> 25:16.770
Tiffany was really, uh, tightening
up her stomach.

25:16.800 --> 25:19.790
Uh... what isthis last question?

25:19.820 --> 25:22.650
"Do you know about the affect?"

25:22.680 --> 25:24.220
Affair?

25:24.240 --> 25:26.490
That's seriously supposed to be an "r"?

25:26.530 --> 25:28.510
That is illegible.

25:29.080 --> 25:31.000
Wait a minute. What affair?

25:40.460 --> 25:41.550
You recognize him?

25:41.570 --> 25:43.100
Is this the guy?

25:43.650 --> 25:47.700
The only way we can keep you safe, kenny, is
if you help us catch the killer.

25:47.750 --> 25:49.840
So is this the guy or not?

25:54.290 --> 25:55.660
No.

25:55.700 --> 25:58.100
No, it's... that's...
that's not him.

25:58.690 --> 26:02.170
Do you think someone could swing by my
house and get my electric toothbrush?

26:02.210 --> 26:05.510
L-l-I'm supposed to use it two minutes
in the morning, two minutes at night.

26:05.530 --> 26:08.500
Also, my floss
- mint, waxed.

26:08.530 --> 26:11.290
You can get that at any drugstore.

26:11.310 --> 26:13.090
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

26:15.070 --> 26:17.830
You didn't notice all
these charges on your credit cards?

26:17.850 --> 26:22.100
I have a business manager who
takes care of the bills.

26:22.130 --> 26:25.430
I hire a lot of people to
do a lot of things.

26:26.860 --> 26:30.020
Well, I hope she got her money's worth.

26:32.610 --> 26:34.070
So, are we done here?

26:34.110 --> 26:35.180
Yes, sir.

26:53.030 --> 26:54.500
Uh, chief, I looked
into those...

26:54.540 --> 26:56.840
Chief, I
am s...

26:57.330 --> 27:01.140
I am so sorry that you had to find
out about this transfer this way.

27:01.170 --> 27:06.490
We've... everyone... we all thought chief pope
had already told you about his... his decision.

27:06.510 --> 27:08.260
Chief pope's decision?

27:08.800 --> 27:13.740
Sergeant, even with your face covered up and
your voice distorted by that stupid mask,

27:13.770 --> 27:15.540
you are still a terrible liar.

27:15.560 --> 27:18.000
Now, stick to the case.

27:18.030 --> 27:20.170
I looked into lewis' story,

27:20.190 --> 27:24.190
and, in fact, he was at mastro's having
dinner at the time of the murder.

27:24.220 --> 27:25.130
That's no surprise.

27:25.160 --> 27:28.080
He doesn't strike me as the type of guy who
could bring down someone like mr. Cooper.

27:28.100 --> 27:30.170
Well, a taser could even things out.

27:30.190 --> 27:31.730
Yeah, but
does he...

27:31.750 --> 27:34.430
does he seem like the
type of guy that owns a taser?

27:34.440 --> 27:36.090
No, but
-

27:36.120 --> 27:41.600
no, but he seems like the kind of guy
who would hire someone who owns a taser.

27:47.480 --> 27:50.230
We still need a rescue of
some kind, and I'm not planning it.

27:50.260 --> 27:52.550
As soon as I'm done with
this murder, I'll get right on that.

27:52.570 --> 27:55.680
Great, and remember, these people need to
demonstrate they can save someone from,

27:55.710 --> 27:58.920
one -a life-threatening attack, two...
a riot, or three... a natural catastrophe.

27:58.950 --> 28:00.820
I'll leave it to you to
decide how that's done.

28:00.870 --> 28:03.200
You have three hours and
six minutes left.

28:04.320 --> 28:06.960
Lieutenant tao... lieutenant tao,

28:06.990 --> 28:11.450
I need to knowwhat's going on with
the lewis' phones and computers, please.

28:11.780 --> 28:12.670
Okay.

28:12.690 --> 28:13.940
Starting from
the beginning...

28:13.980 --> 28:15.780
no, no, no, no. The end.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.440
Quick. Like a bunny.

28:18.290 --> 28:23.570
Last tuesday, a call was placed from bob
lewis' office to the cellphone of an eric ellis.

28:23.590 --> 28:27.390
Now, eric ellis is not
one of our finest citizens.

28:27.420 --> 28:31.680
Ellis has a record... few b&es, couple
of assaults, presently unemployed,

28:31.710 --> 28:36.470
which makes the $10,000 deposited into
his bank account on the 22nd so interesting.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.140
Could be payment for a hit.

28:38.170 --> 28:40.750
Which is why taylor's
guys pulled him in for us.

28:40.780 --> 28:43.510
Here's ellis' record with his
booking photo for handy reference.

28:43.550 --> 28:45.360
Thank you, lieutenant.

28:48.110 --> 28:52.220
Oh! Oh, for heaven's sake, sit down.

28:52.980 --> 29:00.110
Mr. Ellis, I need to speak to you about where
you were at 9:00 last wednesday, the 24th.

29:00.140 --> 29:01.650
You mean wednesday the 25th.

29:01.680 --> 29:05.630
No, I mean wednesday the
24th, two nights ago.

29:05.650 --> 29:07.850
Well, I think I was at
the gym on the 25th.

29:07.860 --> 29:09.200
It's the 24th, sir.

29:09.220 --> 29:11.680
And can anyone substantiate that?

29:11.690 --> 29:14.410
Oh, you mean an alibi, right?

29:14.420 --> 29:16.360
Yeah, people saw me wednesday night.

29:16.360 --> 29:19.960
Would one of those people
happen to have been mr. Bob lewis?

29:19.990 --> 29:25.390
Uh, never heard of no one by
the name of bob lewis... ever.

29:25.420 --> 29:28.770
Really? Well, mr. Lewis' phone
records indicate otherwise,

29:28.800 --> 29:31.900
and when I spoke to him earlier
about the murder of glen cooper 每

29:31.920 --> 29:35.670
you spoke to mr. Lewis about a murderer?

29:35.690 --> 29:37.110
Yes.

29:37.700 --> 29:42.120
So, mr. Lewis isn't dead?

29:42.150 --> 29:43.760
Now you've got it.

29:43.790 --> 29:45.880
So, who got killed?

29:45.910 --> 29:51.890
Glen cooper... mr. Lewis' wife's boyfriend.

29:54.770 --> 29:56.000
On wednesday the 25th?

29:56.010 --> 29:58.430
It's wednesday the 24th!

30:01.140 --> 30:03.070
Can I see a calendar?

30:21.570 --> 30:24.280
Can you explain that
whole lawyer thing to me again?

30:29.940 --> 30:33.200
You said you weren't gonna
tell my husband about the affair.

30:33.220 --> 30:34.950
Uh, it was unavoidable.

30:34.970 --> 30:36.050
I'm sorry.

30:36.430 --> 30:38.310
What am I supposed to do?

30:38.320 --> 30:40.960
I told you about bob's temper.

30:40.990 --> 30:45.200
Why don't you stay here for a while until
we're able to deal with your husband?

30:45.240 --> 30:46.860
And, um, lieutenant provenza,

30:46.880 --> 30:51.450
if you could ask taylor to take kenny
woodsto the restroom for a while,

30:51.490 --> 30:55.940
and, uh, put mrs. Lewis into
interview room number 1.

30:55.950 --> 30:56.590
Yes, ma'am.

30:56.600 --> 30:57.330
Thank you.

30:57.350 --> 30:58.570
My pleasure.

31:07.580 --> 31:09.830
I'm workin' real hard on
gettin' you an attorney,

31:09.860 --> 31:12.900
but it would help me a lot if
I could take your picture.

31:12.910 --> 31:13.900
Is that okay?

31:13.930 --> 31:15.850
Oh, sure.

31:16.940 --> 31:19.440
No, uh, please stand.

31:21.760 --> 31:22.880
Thank you.

31:22.930 --> 31:26.060
Um, if you could, uh, walk
over there to the corner.

31:27.120 --> 31:28.550
And, um...

31:29.350 --> 31:30.560
that's very nice.

31:30.640 --> 31:32.580
Now, sort of, um...

31:33.200 --> 31:36.900
slump against the wall,

31:36.930 --> 31:43.710
and then slide down... to... the floor.

31:43.720 --> 31:44.410
That's good.

31:44.420 --> 31:47.510
Now, uh, stretch your legs out.

31:48.970 --> 31:49.490
Good.

31:49.500 --> 31:51.980
Now, um, close your eyes.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.420
Put your chin on your chest.

31:54.460 --> 31:55.680
Good.

31:55.710 --> 31:58.810
Now, don't move.

32:00.220 --> 32:01.200
Thank you.

32:01.240 --> 32:03.330
Thank you so much.

32:09.070 --> 32:11.470
Mr. Cox, I beg your pardon.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.850
I seem to be havin'
trouble communicatin' with my squad.

32:13.870 --> 32:16.100
I wonder if you might
wantto take a look at that.

32:17.150 --> 32:18.450
Radio check.

32:19.650 --> 32:21.030
I'll be backin one minute.

32:21.070 --> 32:22.000
Sure.

32:38.140 --> 32:39.330
Take
off...

32:39.600 --> 32:42.800
take off this ridiculous
helmet! And the suit!

32:42.820 --> 32:44.080
All of it!

32:44.200 --> 32:45.840
For heaven's sakes.

32:48.530 --> 32:51.740
Chief, this could endthe
entire training session.

32:51.760 --> 32:54.080
Well, some things are
moreimportant, lieutenant tao.

32:54.100 --> 32:58.680
Now, buzz, I need you to put
onthis hat and that suit. Hurry.

32:58.700 --> 33:00.860
You want me to go out there
and pretend to be lieutenant tao?

33:00.870 --> 33:02.630
Yes. Exactly.

33:02.670 --> 33:04.210
Do I have to over-explain everything?

33:04.220 --> 33:04.850
Hey!

33:04.860 --> 33:10.120
No, just nod, but you have to do it quickly before
mr. Cox realizes that lieutenant tao is gone.

33:10.150 --> 33:11.790
I don't know about this, chief.

33:11.810 --> 33:15.340
As long as mr. Cox
thinks that buzz is you...

33:18.700 --> 33:21.510
he thinks he's someone
else on wednesday the 25th.

33:21.540 --> 33:23.340
You mean wednesday the 24th.

33:23.360 --> 33:26.800
No, lieutenant, I mean wednesday the 25th.

33:29.900 --> 33:34.030
Lieutenant, I took a picture, and
I need you to help me with it.

33:52.510 --> 33:53.830
It's fixed.

33:53.950 --> 33:56.140
Looks as if someone took out the battery.

33:56.180 --> 33:57.680
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

33:57.710 --> 33:59.600
How did that happen, I wonder?

33:59.630 --> 34:00.910
Me too.

34:09.870 --> 34:11.239
Good news, mr. Woods.

34:11.270 --> 34:16.510
I believe we found the man responsible for
the murder you may or may not have witnessed.

34:16.540 --> 34:18.530
No, no, I don't wantto look at them.

34:18.550 --> 34:21.239
I don't need you to
give me an I.D. Anymore.

34:21.260 --> 34:24.040
I just want you to feel
safe goin' back to work.

34:24.070 --> 34:29.170
I want you to take a look at these photos
and let me know if anything jumps out at you,

34:29.199 --> 34:33.540
and then... the floss is all yours.

34:33.590 --> 34:35.670
Waxed, mint.

34:35.730 --> 34:39.120
You can use it all the way
home to your electric toothbrush.

34:41.929 --> 34:43.340
Photos.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.530
This one.

34:54.190 --> 34:56.040
When... when did this happen?

34:56.090 --> 34:59.230
Oh, uh, that happened this morning.

35:00.260 --> 35:01.610
Yeah. Yeah.

35:01.630 --> 35:04.900
That's... that's
the guy.

35:07.280 --> 35:15.100
I was... I was parking an '07 highlander
when I pulled around, and there they were.

35:15.120 --> 35:22.680
And this guy, he... he wrapped something around
the other guy's neckand he pulled... hard.

35:22.710 --> 35:25.390
And I just...
I... oh...

35:25.400 --> 35:28.330
so you found a phone in the
car that you were parking.

35:28.350 --> 35:31.930
And I called
- I called 911.

35:32.230 --> 35:37.140
Then he saw me, and he
ran over, and I froze.

35:37.710 --> 35:43.590
He banged on the window, and he...
he started screaming that he was gonna 每

35:43.620 --> 35:48.150
he was gonna kill me if
I told anyone what I saw.

35:48.180 --> 35:52.930
Then... then I heard... I heard sirens,

35:52.960 --> 35:55.360
and then he
- he ran away.

36:01.420 --> 36:02.870
Thank you.

36:12.220 --> 36:14.290
Just checkin' to make
sure you're all right.

36:14.360 --> 36:15.990
Do you need anything?

36:16.570 --> 36:17.840
No.

36:17.860 --> 36:19.860
I think I'm okay.

36:20.690 --> 36:21.950
I don't know.

36:21.970 --> 36:23.990
Maybe I'm not okay.

36:24.020 --> 36:26.960
Well, you can cry if you want to.

36:27.810 --> 36:30.970
I don't want my makeup to get all ruined.

36:31.250 --> 36:35.750
But it's... it's... it's hard.

36:35.870 --> 36:37.750
Glen was really nice to me.

36:37.790 --> 36:42.050
And I know guys are nice
when they want something, you know?

36:42.550 --> 36:45.580
Or maybe you don't know.

36:46.530 --> 36:50.530
But glen really cared
about me, and now he's gone.

36:50.670 --> 36:54.640
And I have no idea when
bob's gonna let me come back home.

36:54.750 --> 36:56.030
Maybe I don't even want to go.

36:56.050 --> 36:57.580
Well, maybe you don't have to.

36:57.610 --> 36:59.390
We've looked into your husband's story,

36:59.410 --> 37:02.340
and the night that glen
was killed, on wednesday the 24th -

37:02.360 --> 37:05.050
you mean wednesday the 25th.

37:05.070 --> 37:08.950
No, tiffany, I mean wednesday the 24th.

37:08.970 --> 37:11.600
And you're the second person in
an hour to make that mistake.

37:11.600 --> 37:14.910
The other person was eric ellis, the
man who murdered your boyfriend.

37:14.930 --> 37:16.740
But I don't think he meant to kill glen.

37:16.770 --> 37:18.550
I think he meant to kill your husband.

37:18.560 --> 37:22.600
That way you could be with glen and not
have to worry about that messy prenup.

37:24.390 --> 37:28.200
Don't I get any fourth or
fifth amendment somethings?

37:28.860 --> 37:31.200
Yes, you do.

37:31.740 --> 37:35.270
You have, for example, the
right to remain silent.

37:35.290 --> 37:38.600
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

37:38.630 --> 37:40.200
You have the right to an attorney.

37:40.220 --> 37:44.420
If you cannot afford an attorney, the
court will appoint one for you.

37:44.430 --> 37:46.120
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?

37:46.150 --> 37:51.500
You are going to arrest me for
attempting to murdermy husband?

37:51.510 --> 37:54.480
No, I'm not.

37:54.720 --> 37:56.070
I would have, of course,

37:56.100 --> 38:01.130
if the stupid hit man hadn't made a mistake about
what night to follow you and your husband to dinner.

38:01.160 --> 38:03.780
Well, that might've been my fault.

38:03.810 --> 38:05.470
I'm not so good with numbers.

38:05.500 --> 38:10.070
But the money that you paid eric ellis to
murder your husband, that came from glen, right?

38:10.100 --> 38:12.700
So you wouldn't be connected to
your husband's murder.

38:13.190 --> 38:14.770
It's so unfair.

38:14.810 --> 38:17.280
Glen ended up paying for his own death.

38:17.300 --> 38:19.800
I really feel like l let him down.

38:20.180 --> 38:22.930
Did you pay mr. Ellis up front?

38:23.040 --> 38:25.150
What do I look like, an idiot?

38:25.270 --> 38:26.890
I only gave him half.

38:26.920 --> 38:31.010
After you told me glen was killed, I
called and canceled everything.

38:31.050 --> 38:33.260
And I asked for my money back.

38:33.280 --> 38:34.770
Ooh, I should check my messages.

38:34.790 --> 38:37.090
I bet you that blockhead
finally returned my call.

38:37.110 --> 38:40.790
Um, I'd hold off on that if I were you.

38:41.110 --> 38:43.900
You only get one call, and you might
want to use it to contact a lawyer.

38:43.920 --> 38:45.210
What?

38:45.650 --> 38:46.890
But you said...

38:46.970 --> 38:48.640
all right, now, wait a minute, lady!

38:48.680 --> 38:52.280
You told me that I wasn't in trouble
for trying to kill my husband!

38:52.310 --> 38:53.720
That's right.

38:53.740 --> 38:57.970
But you are under arrest for what happened to
glen cooper, which is murderin the first degree.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.570
I didn't hire that guy to kill glen.

39:00.600 --> 39:04.960
I hired him to kill my
husband, and he didn't even do it!

39:08.950 --> 39:11.650
This is a tapestry of justice.

39:11.680 --> 39:14.840
That's what it is
- a complete tapestry.

39:17.430 --> 39:18.760
You!

39:18.920 --> 39:20.940
Stupid hit man!

39:21.050 --> 39:22.400
Stupid, stupid!

39:22.430 --> 39:24.000
You're the stupid person!

39:24.020 --> 39:26.700
You were supposed to kill my husband!

39:26.730 --> 39:28.060
My husband!

39:28.080 --> 39:29.380
I thought he was your husband!

39:29.400 --> 39:30.200
You kissed him!

39:30.230 --> 39:32.150
I don't kiss my husband!

39:32.170 --> 39:33.690
You idiotic...

39:35.520 --> 39:37.500
He's supposed to be dead!

39:43.860 --> 39:44.910
Riot!

39:44.950 --> 39:45.800
Man down!

39:45.820 --> 39:46.690
Man down!

39:46.720 --> 39:48.330

39:49.370 --> 39:52.040

39:55.910 --> 39:57.330
You're next!

39:57.620 --> 39:58.340
You're next!

39:58.370 --> 40:00.880
No, you're next, meathead!

40:12.140 --> 40:14.080
What the hellis going on here?

40:15.420 --> 40:17.460
Wmd trainin'.

40:17.560 --> 40:19.260
It's windin' down.

40:34.580 --> 40:36.430
Time.

40:36.450 --> 40:38.970
Qualification has been achieved.

40:39.080 --> 40:43.450
You may all remove your
gear and sign the "q" log, please.

40:57.500 --> 40:58.890
It's okay, tao.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.910
You can take your helmet off now.

41:27.080 --> 41:29.140
You're michael tao?

41:29.880 --> 41:32.370
That's lieutenant michael tao.

41:33.330 --> 41:35.040
He's adopted.

41:44.570 --> 41:45.850
Brenda...

41:49.740 --> 41:50.420
hello.

41:50.460 --> 41:52.850
Brenda, this is Dr. Jackson.

41:52.880 --> 41:54.840
Dr. Jackson, this is brenda.

41:54.850 --> 41:56.270
Hello.

41:56.300 --> 41:58.280
Since we got a little busy yesterday,

41:58.300 --> 42:02.790
uh, agent howard thought I
should stop by, see how you feel.

42:03.890 --> 42:06.070
Just, uh, o-one second.

42:06.180 --> 42:08.630
Can I talk to you for a moment, please?

42:09.120 --> 42:10.560
Excuse me.

42:14.460 --> 42:18.060
I really... I don't want to do this right now.

42:18.510 --> 42:21.060
Well... I do.

42:25.480 --> 42:26.640
Okay.

42:29.630 --> 42:31.000
Oh, um...

42:31.780 --> 42:34.320
why don't you have a seat and relax?

42:34.340 --> 42:36.590
And I'll call for you when I'm ready.
