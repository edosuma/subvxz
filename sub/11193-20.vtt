00:15.057 --> 00:16.432
(alarm)

00:16.600 --> 00:19.478
(PA) Unauthorised incoming traveller!

00:19.519 --> 00:21.646
(man) Clear the ramp!

00:33.240 --> 00:35.241
- Who is it?
- No idea, sir.

00:35.320 --> 00:38.155
SG-5 and SG-14 are out.
Neither are due till tomorrow.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.993
- No iris code?
- No, sir.

00:41.161 --> 00:43.579
I did not give the order
to open the iris, mister!

00:43.640 --> 00:45.642
- I did not open it, sir.
- Well, close it!

00:50.920 --> 00:52.381
Get that iris closed!

00:52.481 --> 00:55.442
I'm trying, but the computer
keeps overriding it.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.360
General.

01:39.682 --> 01:41.266
Search him.

01:41.362 --> 01:45.322
General, if I... may suggest...

01:45.323 --> 01:48.033
allowing Carter to do it.

01:48.081 --> 01:50.752
She can detect other stuff.

01:56.201 --> 01:57.578
Hello.

01:57.682 --> 01:59.475
What's your name?

02:02.242 --> 02:05.078
OK. My name is Sam.

02:07.724 --> 02:09.725
I have to check you for...

02:11.402 --> 02:14.072
for things you probably
know nothing about.

02:14.603 --> 02:16.605
But just in case...

02:35.603 --> 02:38.064
Well, he's not Goa'uld or Jaffa.

02:38.123 --> 02:40.126
I can't sense any naqahdah.

02:40.203 --> 02:42.204
As far as I can tell he's clean.

02:42.283 --> 02:43.867
What's he doing here?

02:50.283 --> 02:52.284
I am here to warn you.

04:06.126 --> 04:09.294
Well, as far as I can tell, he's human.

04:09.325 --> 04:10.911
No bomb in the chest?

04:11.006 --> 04:13.842
- Little biohazard in the tooth?
- Checked for both.

04:13.885 --> 04:18.204
He's no threat to us, as far as
I'm able to tell, but he's pretty weak.

04:18.206 --> 04:20.416
I'm guessing he's malnourished.

04:22.646 --> 04:24.230
What's your name?

04:25.605 --> 04:27.606
Your name is Colonel O'Neill.

04:32.005 --> 04:35.009
- How'd you know that?
- My mother told me.

04:39.766 --> 04:41.976
- Your mother?
- Yes.

04:44.646 --> 04:46.981
She says I am to speak only with you.

04:47.526 --> 04:50.571
Well, these people are my friends.
You can trust them.

04:52.766 --> 04:54.810
Mother says to speak only to you.

04:55.726 --> 04:57.103
OK.

04:57.206 --> 04:59.000
Why me?

04:59.086 --> 05:02.048
Mother has observed you
and determined she likes you.

05:02.088 --> 05:04.089
You are one who can be trusted.

05:04.726 --> 05:06.728
Well, thank you, ma'am.

05:08.526 --> 05:12.685
- How long have you been watching me?
- For many weeks.

05:12.687 --> 05:15.105
- Weeks?
- Yes.

05:15.166 --> 05:19.605
She first saw you on another planet and
followed your team through the Stargate.

05:19.608 --> 05:23.927
She observed you all until
your team returned with the one called...

05:23.927 --> 05:25.887
Tonane.

05:25.968 --> 05:27.927
Based on your actions...

05:28.007 --> 05:31.302
Mother believes you are
the only honourable leader here.

05:31.327 --> 05:34.622
It was only your team who did not
want to steal Tonane's mineral.

05:34.648 --> 05:36.649
Then why not trust the rest of my team?

05:40.528 --> 05:42.321
Because you are the leader.

05:42.408 --> 05:47.079
Mother insists I speak no further
unless it is with you alone.

05:48.367 --> 05:51.495
Let's step into the corridor
for a few moments, folks.

06:03.687 --> 06:07.149
- So what do I call you?
- I do not have a name.

06:07.689 --> 06:10.358
- What does your mom call you?
- Son.

06:11.769 --> 06:15.648
- That's not much of a name.
- No. It's more of a description.

06:17.009 --> 06:18.593
Yes, it is.

06:18.689 --> 06:21.526
Mother says you too have a son.

06:23.968 --> 06:26.928
I had one. He's gone now.

06:27.408 --> 06:28.994
What was his name?

06:30.209 --> 06:32.418
- Charlie.
- Charlie.

06:32.488 --> 06:36.659
I like Charlie. It's a good name.
Can I be called Charlie?

06:40.409 --> 06:42.286
Yeah.

06:42.370 --> 06:44.372
Sure. If that's what you want.

06:44.449 --> 06:47.159
OK, Colonel O'Neill, I'm Charlie.

06:50.608 --> 06:52.110
Hi, Charlie.

06:57.370 --> 06:59.913
- Call me Jack.
- Jack.

07:11.490 --> 07:13.283
So where are you from?

07:13.370 --> 07:15.663
A planet called Reetalia.

07:15.730 --> 07:18.231
- Nice place?
- Used to be...

07:18.290 --> 07:23.488
until most of the Reetou were destroyed
by mean creatures with glowing eyes.

07:23.490 --> 07:26.369
That's the Goa'uld.
I'm sorry to hear that.

07:26.411 --> 07:29.204
That's why I'm here-to warn you.

07:30.490 --> 07:34.449
Well, thank you, Charlie,
but we already knew about the Goa'uld.

07:34.451 --> 07:39.038
Not the Goa'uld. It's the Reetou rebels
who intend to eliminate you.

07:43.689 --> 07:45.692
We analysed the iris mechanism.

07:45.771 --> 07:50.170
It was as if control was commandeered
from the main computer by an override.

07:50.170 --> 07:53.173
Like it was being controlled
from another keyboard.

07:53.211 --> 07:55.463
Software specialists are picking it apart.

07:55.531 --> 07:58.951
Colonel O'Neill,
any more insight into the boy?

07:58.971 --> 08:02.930
The best I can tell, sir,
the kid survived a Goa'uld massacre.

08:02.930 --> 08:06.889
That would explain Mom. It would be
a psychological defence mechanism.

08:06.891 --> 08:11.769
He's convinced himself she never left
him. That her "spirit" is always with him.

08:11.771 --> 08:15.151
- How did he know about the Salish?
- How did he know about my kid?

08:15.172 --> 08:17.841
Is it possible that
he's some sort of psychic?

08:17.851 --> 08:20.812
Maybe we'll turn something up
in our examinations.

08:20.851 --> 08:24.521
Should not our concern now be
the threat of the planned Reetou attack?

08:24.531 --> 08:28.651
It doesn't make sense. The Goa'uld
attack the Reetou, so they attack us?

08:28.651 --> 08:33.250
We need to determine the validity of
what little information the boy's given us.

08:33.251 --> 08:36.880
Teal'c, I'd like you to accompany
Colonel O'Neill to see him.

08:36.893 --> 08:39.895
Listen to his description
of the attack on the Reetou...

08:39.932 --> 08:43.061
and let me know if it follows
normal Goa'uld tactics.

08:51.491 --> 08:53.284
There you go.

08:53.371 --> 08:55.457
See? That didn't hurt at all, did it?

08:58.533 --> 09:00.034
Jaffa!

09:03.893 --> 09:05.727
Get that a lot?

09:06.253 --> 09:08.047
Charlie! Charlie! It's OK.

09:08.133 --> 09:11.678
He's a Jaffa! He wants to kill me,
just like he killed the Reetou.

09:11.692 --> 09:14.738
No, no! No, no, no. He's a good Jaffa.

09:16.173 --> 09:18.592
In fact, he saved my life one time.

09:19.293 --> 09:21.961
- He hates the Goa'uld as much as you do.
- No!

09:27.852 --> 09:29.855
Oh, for cryin' out loud...

09:34.334 --> 09:36.543
Um, look, Mom.

09:37.134 --> 09:39.135
You said you trust me, right?

09:39.212 --> 09:44.371
Well, I'm telling you, Teal'c is OK. In fact,
all my friends here at the base are OK.

09:44.373 --> 09:46.750
- OK?
- She's over there.

09:52.933 --> 09:54.769
OK.

09:55.455 --> 09:59.207
Mother says to trust only you
and the other members of your team.

09:59.215 --> 10:01.426
Good. Thank you.

10:03.854 --> 10:07.566
Charlie, Teal'c. Teal'c, Charlie.

10:11.254 --> 10:13.256
I am pleased to meet you.

10:17.254 --> 10:21.693
Listen, Charlie. We have to ask you
about the attack on your people.

10:21.695 --> 10:23.697
Can you talk about that?

10:24.134 --> 10:26.136
L-I-I am sorry, O'Neill.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.297
I must leave this room.

10:31.735 --> 10:33.320
Excuse me, Charlie.

10:34.255 --> 10:36.048
Um, Mother.

10:40.375 --> 10:42.376
What's the matter?

10:42.855 --> 10:46.192
My symbiote became agitated
when I entered the room.

10:47.455 --> 10:49.249
Any idea why?

10:49.336 --> 10:51.796
I can tell you only this, O'Neill.

10:51.855 --> 10:55.734
In all of my years I have never
experienced a symbiote so disturbed.

10:57.336 --> 11:01.048
There is something unusual
about this child, O'Neill.

11:01.056 --> 11:03.850
I advise you use extreme caution
in his handling.

11:03.895 --> 11:05.605
I was planning on it.

11:05.696 --> 11:08.115
You have seen it yourself.

11:08.176 --> 11:11.346
To the Goa'uld, a child is
nothing more than a potent weapon.

11:11.375 --> 11:15.735
Carter and Fraiser checked him out for
all the threats we met in the other kids.

11:15.735 --> 11:18.113
I didn't find any apparent threat to us...

11:18.176 --> 11:21.053
but he's in worse shape
than I thought, the poor kid.

11:21.096 --> 11:25.134
- Several organs have congenital defects.
- Oh, God.

11:25.136 --> 11:28.014
It's like mother nature
got everything a little wrong.

11:28.057 --> 11:31.059
His heart valves and
renal function are defective...

11:31.096 --> 11:34.642
and I have serious questions
about his lungs.

11:34.657 --> 11:39.077
Without aggressive medical intervention,
he won't live to be much older than he is.

11:40.177 --> 11:43.304
- Can you help him?
- Maybe.

11:43.336 --> 11:46.255
But he may be beyond
anything our medicine can do.

11:46.297 --> 11:48.466
There's something else.

11:48.537 --> 11:50.538
Charlie's CAT scan.

11:50.616 --> 11:54.120
If you look along
the lower part of the brainstem...

11:54.136 --> 11:57.264
this is where normal humans
have the reticular formation.

11:57.297 --> 12:01.416
It's the part of the brain that determines
alertness, our perception of things.

12:01.417 --> 12:03.501
Charlie's is twice the size of ours.

12:03.576 --> 12:06.080
That could explain
why he knew you had a son...

12:06.136 --> 12:08.932
and why he had such an effect
on Teal'c's symbiote.

12:08.977 --> 12:12.355
So what? He's got ESP?
Some telekinetic thing going on?

12:12.898 --> 12:16.652
I don't know.
I'm a sceptic on such things, but...

12:19.418 --> 12:21.419
It would explain a lot.

12:23.898 --> 12:28.537
So, Charlie, tell us why
the Reetou want to attack us.

12:28.538 --> 12:33.096
It's not the central authority of the Reetou.
It's only the Reetou rebel faction.

12:33.096 --> 12:35.432
OK. Why do the rebels want to attack us?

12:35.499 --> 12:37.750
The glowing-eye people
attacked the Reetou.

12:37.818 --> 12:39.278
The Goa'uld?

12:44.219 --> 12:48.538
The rebels believe the glowing-eye people
are too powerful to destroy directly.

12:48.538 --> 12:52.042
They believe they can
only be destroyed by...

12:52.058 --> 12:53.226
attrition.

12:53.337 --> 12:55.131
Attrition? What does that mean?

12:55.219 --> 12:58.096
Uh, attrition is
the gradual diminution of strength...

12:58.139 --> 13:01.600
I know what the word means.
I meant in context.

13:02.139 --> 13:06.458
My God. They must want
to kill all possible hosts.

13:06.460 --> 13:10.898
They must think that, if the Goa'uld have
no new hosts to infest, they'll die out.

13:10.899 --> 13:13.110
- By attrition.
- Yes.

13:13.178 --> 13:17.817
It's insane! There are billions of possible
Goa'uld hosts all throughout the galaxy.

13:17.818 --> 13:19.653
And they are not all human.

13:19.739 --> 13:21.990
Mother agrees.

13:22.058 --> 13:25.269
That is why the central authority
of the Reetou sent us here.

13:27.818 --> 13:29.613
Charlie...

13:30.179 --> 13:32.640
I'm curious. Are you a Reetou?

13:33.659 --> 13:36.203
No. I am of your species.

13:36.259 --> 13:39.263
- Is your mother a Reetou?
- Of course.

13:39.299 --> 13:42.302
- And is that why we can't see her?
- Yes.

13:42.340 --> 13:45.259
Well, if you're one of us,
why can you see her?

13:49.059 --> 13:52.147
- Cos I'm special.
- You're special. How?

13:52.179 --> 13:55.142
Mother created me
to serve as an intermediary.

13:55.181 --> 13:57.725
- She created you?
- Yes.

13:57.780 --> 13:59.990
She hoped I'd be older before we came...

14:00.059 --> 14:04.620
but my rapid growth caused my body to
begin failing, so we had to come sooner.

14:04.620 --> 14:08.081
Captain, you're our physics expert here.

14:08.100 --> 14:12.778
Is it possible there's a creature
standing here that we can't perceive?

14:12.780 --> 14:15.866
Theoretically it is possible, sir, yes.

14:15.900 --> 14:20.740
According to quantum physics,
matter exists both in particles and waves.

14:20.740 --> 14:26.059
If the Reetou waves are exactly
180 degrees out of phase with ours...

14:26.061 --> 14:29.898
then their light and sound waves
would be undetectable by us.

14:29.900 --> 14:32.861
So, what? Prepare for an attack
by an invisible army?

14:32.900 --> 14:36.363
If there is a Reetou in this room,
it came through the Stargate.

14:36.380 --> 14:38.383
And it is able to control the iris.

14:38.461 --> 14:42.258
Son, how did your mother do that?

14:42.261 --> 14:44.472
I am no longer called Son.

14:44.542 --> 14:46.543
Call me Charlie.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.423
Charlie...

14:52.741 --> 14:55.995
how did your mother control the iris?

14:56.020 --> 14:58.105
Mother came ahead of me weeks ago.

14:58.181 --> 15:00.767
She observed you
and how you operate the iris.

15:00.822 --> 15:04.243
Then, when the time came,
she opened it for me just as you do.

15:04.261 --> 15:08.301
- She just typed it into the computer?
- That is how the computer behaved, sir.

15:08.302 --> 15:11.514
As if it was being overridden
by another console.

15:11.542 --> 15:14.003
So the Reetou can
operate things in our phase?

15:15.903 --> 15:17.278
Yes.

15:20.542 --> 15:21.918
Carter?

15:23.263 --> 15:26.725
It is possible, sir,
but it doesn't seem very likely.

15:26.741 --> 15:30.413
Mother is growing impatient
with your narrow-mindedness.

15:33.621 --> 15:35.206
Stand down!

15:41.743 --> 15:44.162
- I assume that came from...
- Mother.

15:45.341 --> 15:47.135
Mother.

15:52.984 --> 15:55.193
Theories? Suggestions?

15:57.182 --> 15:59.393
Seems obvious that this Reetou exists.

15:59.462 --> 16:04.022
Well, here's a question.
How do we deal with an invisible threat?

16:04.023 --> 16:08.101
- We need a way to detect them.
- That would be helpful.

16:08.102 --> 16:11.856
I have that way. It seems
my symbiote can sense this creature.

16:13.423 --> 16:17.383
- OK. Limited helpfulness right there.
- Explain.

16:17.384 --> 16:20.553
Can it tell us where exactly
in a room a Reetou is...

16:20.583 --> 16:23.169
how many there are,
what they're doing, etc?

16:23.225 --> 16:26.852
It was not that specific.
It only detected a presence.

16:26.864 --> 16:29.408
So... limited.

16:29.463 --> 16:33.301
If my symbiote can detect this creature,
the Goa'uld can also sense them.

16:33.303 --> 16:35.764
Good point.
They had to see them to kill them.

16:36.784 --> 16:40.246
- Perhaps the Tok'ra can help.
- (Hammond) It could be our best hope.

16:40.904 --> 16:44.116
Captain Carter, Dr Jackson,
signal the Tok'ra.

16:44.144 --> 16:46.147
Yes, sir.

17:13.664 --> 17:15.790
Hello, Sam.

17:15.865 --> 17:19.117
Dad, we have a situation
and we may need Selmak's help.

17:19.144 --> 17:21.230
Selmak, Selmak, Selmak.

17:21.305 --> 17:24.266
- I thought maybe you wanted to see me.
- I do, Dad.

17:24.306 --> 17:26.642
But this time
we do need your symbiote, Jacob.

17:26.704 --> 17:30.375
- Nice to see you too, George.
- No offence, old friend.

17:36.184 --> 17:41.065
(distorted) It is an honour to return to your
planet, General. What can we do for you?

17:41.785 --> 17:45.163
Have you ever heard of
something called a Reetou?

17:45.185 --> 17:48.146
- Yes. Why?
- We may have one here.

17:48.185 --> 17:51.021
Tok'ra kree. Tak lan onobi lon.

17:54.625 --> 17:57.295
Please send him back
to where we came from.

18:00.266 --> 18:02.602
In the meantime, take me to this Reetou.

18:19.467 --> 18:22.178
Hey, Charlie. How you feelin'?

18:22.747 --> 18:25.708
Tired. Really tired.

18:25.747 --> 18:26.914
(door opens)

18:27.028 --> 18:29.614
For cryin' out loud.

18:36.067 --> 18:38.068
Charlie, it's all right. It's OK.

18:38.866 --> 18:41.077
It's all right, he's not a Goa'uld.

18:41.147 --> 18:43.692
He's a Tok'ra. They're OK.

18:46.146 --> 18:47.315
Dad?

18:54.707 --> 18:56.667
(undistorted) Oh...

18:56.748 --> 18:59.291
You are correct.
There is a Reetou in that room.

19:00.387 --> 19:02.390
Taka ram.

19:03.748 --> 19:06.792
This will illuminate
the Reetou, if it is there.

19:11.267 --> 19:13.269
Follow me.

19:21.067 --> 19:22.067
Jacob?

19:25.548 --> 19:27.759
Please don't hurt her!

19:27.827 --> 19:30.498
- My God!
- Hold your fire.

19:30.548 --> 19:34.344
She could've hurt us a long time ago,
if that's what she intended.

19:34.348 --> 19:35.933
Tok'ra kree.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.325
Whoa.

19:47.468 --> 19:49.302
I owe you an apology.

19:49.390 --> 19:51.517
I wouldn't lie to you, Jack.

19:51.589 --> 19:53.549
I know that.

19:53.630 --> 19:55.214
I'm sorry.

19:57.269 --> 20:00.897
- Charlie, I want you to do me a favour.
- What?

20:00.910 --> 20:03.578
You and your mom
stay in this room until I get back.

20:03.588 --> 20:05.590
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

20:06.628 --> 20:08.631
I promise.

20:09.868 --> 20:12.079
Neither one of you. OK?

20:14.910 --> 20:16.077
OK.

20:17.710 --> 20:18.877
OK.

20:22.309 --> 20:28.028
Will somebody please explain to me how
that... thing could be the kid's mother?

20:28.028 --> 20:30.699
He said their leaders
created him to talk with us.

20:30.750 --> 20:33.501
They must have cloned him
or engineered him somehow.

20:33.548 --> 20:37.135
All they'd need is human DNA
and it'd be possible to construct him.

20:37.150 --> 20:40.486
It also explains the extra
reticular formation in his brain.

20:40.509 --> 20:45.230
Could have been genetically engineered
to let him perceive this Reetou "mother".

20:45.230 --> 20:49.309
How do they do something that advanced,
and leave the kid so screwed up?

20:49.310 --> 20:53.105
Genetically engineering a human child
would be a very precise exercise.

20:53.109 --> 20:58.109
Changing genes to alter the reticular
formation could have many ramifications.

20:58.111 --> 21:01.279
We can't see them,
but these Reetou can definitely see us.

21:01.309 --> 21:03.895
Which puts us at
a great strategic disadvantage.

21:03.951 --> 21:06.662
I understand why the Goa'uld
would want to kill them.

21:06.711 --> 21:08.712
They're Goa'uld, Teal'c.

21:08.791 --> 21:10.792
That's their job.

21:10.871 --> 21:12.998
(Jacob) The Reetou are a peaceful race.

21:13.070 --> 21:17.070
The Goa'uld wiped most of them out
just because they were a possible threat.

21:17.071 --> 21:19.615
OK. But how did
the Goa'uld wipe them out?

21:19.671 --> 21:23.048
They were able to isolate
the emissions we are sensitive to...

21:23.070 --> 21:26.115
and develop a device
that would expose the creatures.

21:26.872 --> 21:30.084
This is a Transphase Eradication Rod.

21:30.912 --> 21:35.069
The Tok'ra have managed
to rip off several versions of this device.

21:35.070 --> 21:37.490
It's also capable of terminating a Reetou.

21:37.550 --> 21:41.430
Well, do me a favour, will you?
Don't terminate this Reetou.

21:41.432 --> 21:43.017
I promised the kid.

21:43.112 --> 21:47.825
It appears this Reetou came to warn us
of an impending rebel attack.

21:49.192 --> 21:50.777
Yeah.

21:50.873 --> 21:57.151
The Reetou rebels are kind of like
terrorists are here on Earth-nasty guys.

21:57.152 --> 22:00.780
They could do a lot of damage here, folks.
Kill a lot of people.

22:00.791 --> 22:05.030
- How many are there?
- Don't know, but I do know their MO.

22:05.031 --> 22:08.243
They work in small groups
of five suicide infiltrators.

22:08.271 --> 22:12.191
They sneak in, they split up,
plant destructive devices...

22:12.192 --> 22:15.862
and try to maximise the damage
before they've even been detected.

22:15.873 --> 22:18.166
But they usually attack Goa'uld planets.

22:18.232 --> 22:20.777
Any idea why they want
to attack here on Earth?

22:20.833 --> 22:24.377
Apparently to destroy all possible hosts.

22:26.232 --> 22:28.276
Can they get through our iris?

22:28.353 --> 22:32.471
No. Their molecules wouldn't reintegrate
any more than yours or mine.

22:32.472 --> 22:34.892
Can our weapons even touch them?

22:35.353 --> 22:38.480
Earth weapons
will not be as effective as a TER.

22:38.513 --> 22:42.593
But since the Reetou are somewhat
affected by solid matter in our phase...

22:42.594 --> 22:45.430
your weapons might
at least slow them down.

22:45.913 --> 22:50.335
But, essentially,
we'd be shooting at... nothing?

22:51.353 --> 22:55.231
You bet. Pretty tough to shoot at
a moving target that you can't see.

22:55.752 --> 22:57.755
Even with TERs it's tough.

22:57.834 --> 23:02.421
Best weapon is advanced intel-knowing
where they'll come from and how.

23:03.473 --> 23:08.813
Well, I should talk to Mom. She might
know where this rebel staging planet is.

23:09.673 --> 23:12.719
Wait a minute. Say she tells us
where they're coming from.

23:12.753 --> 23:14.756
Isn't it risky to go looking for them?

23:14.834 --> 23:19.232
It's possible we may let more of them
through to Earth and not even know it.

23:19.233 --> 23:22.403
If we've got TERs,
we'll be able to see them.

23:22.433 --> 23:24.560
We need intelligence, Dr Jackson.

23:24.634 --> 23:28.054
It's the only way
we'll know what we're up against.

23:34.794 --> 23:36.796
Mother says not to cry.

23:42.835 --> 23:44.420
Crying's OK.

23:47.273 --> 23:49.734
She says the boys
of your culture do not cry.

23:50.433 --> 23:52.685
Not true.

23:52.755 --> 24:00.262
In fact, there's an official list of reasons
for which crying is... a good thing.

24:00.756 --> 24:04.300
- Mother is leaving.
- Now, see, that's a good reason.

24:04.315 --> 24:07.942
"Mom leaving", I believe, is number six
on the list of good reasons.

24:07.954 --> 24:11.750
Actually six is "Mom says
she's leaving in a couple of days".

24:11.755 --> 24:15.342
Five is "Mom leaving immediately".

24:15.355 --> 24:18.108
Four, of course, is "Mom already left".

24:18.155 --> 24:21.491
Now, three... Three is huge.
One of the bigger ones on the list.

24:21.516 --> 24:23.101
She's still here.

24:24.556 --> 24:28.101
She's leaving as soon as she has
told you everything that can help.

24:31.276 --> 24:33.278
She's not taking you with her?

24:33.355 --> 24:36.025
She wants to leave me here
with my own kind.

24:37.715 --> 24:41.760
Well, for what it's worth,
I think she's right.

24:42.997 --> 24:45.833
I think you should stay here.
You'd be better off.

24:46.915 --> 24:49.126
I think I belong with you, Jack.

24:53.277 --> 24:55.278
Look, Charlie, um...

24:56.796 --> 25:01.009
Before she leaves, could she tell us
where we can find these rebel Reetous?

25:04.478 --> 25:08.147
- She says she'll show me the address.
- That'd be great.

25:08.557 --> 25:10.433
Jack?

25:10.876 --> 25:13.296
Could I be your son for a while?

25:23.836 --> 25:26.673
I don't know, Charlie.
I don't think you'd want that.

25:26.715 --> 25:28.509
Yes, I do.

25:28.597 --> 25:31.267
You'd be great. I can tell.

25:34.997 --> 25:37.207
I'll tell you what.

25:38.357 --> 25:40.568
Let's deal with these Reetou...

25:41.478 --> 25:43.688
then we'll talk about it, OK?

25:44.396 --> 25:45.773
OK.

25:46.877 --> 25:48.421
OK.

25:48.718 --> 25:50.552
(Stargate alarm)

26:08.317 --> 26:10.112
(technician) MALP is in route.

26:13.877 --> 26:15.880
This is a bit of overkill, George.

26:15.960 --> 26:20.317
These rebels work in five-man squads.
There'll only be five, maybe ten there.

26:20.318 --> 26:22.738
I don't wanna take any chances, Jacob.

26:23.318 --> 26:25.570
OK, listen up!

26:25.638 --> 26:28.599
Colonel O'Neill
is in charge of this operation.

26:28.638 --> 26:32.058
MALP has reached destination.
Scanning with TER.

26:34.078 --> 26:37.332
Colonel, I wanna remind you
this is a recon mission only.

26:37.357 --> 26:39.943
Do not engage the enemy
unless you have no choice.

26:41.159 --> 26:43.577
Can't engage what you can't see, sir.

26:43.640 --> 26:46.602
Do your best for them
not to see you, Colonel.

26:46.638 --> 26:49.183
MALP TER shows
immediate gate vicinity clear.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.001
All right. Here we go, kids.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.001
Move out!

27:21.559 --> 27:23.561
(distorted) Looks clear.

27:24.119 --> 27:25.497
Clear!

27:26.638 --> 27:28.723
Let's go do some snooping around.

27:28.800 --> 27:32.680
You stay with SG-12.
Watch our six. Back sides.

27:43.601 --> 27:45.603
(distorted) Colonel!

27:48.040 --> 27:50.876
The Reetou are present in that direction.

27:50.921 --> 27:53.339
- How many?
- I don't know.

28:06.241 --> 28:08.243
(roaring)

28:11.200 --> 28:12.367
Whoa.

28:18.721 --> 28:20.849
Five or ten...

28:30.001 --> 28:33.047
So you would say
threat assessment is high?

28:33.520 --> 28:35.230
Oh, yeah.

28:35.322 --> 28:37.324
There were a lot of them, sir.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.802
They are indeed invisible.

28:40.322 --> 28:42.740
Are you sure none of them
came through with you?

28:42.801 --> 28:45.305
(Jacob) Can't be sure, but I don't think so.

28:45.363 --> 28:48.074
Selmak's tremors stopped
after we got back...

28:48.123 --> 28:50.290
and my guard did
a TER sweep of the room.

28:50.362 --> 28:53.865
Course, it would only take one
to open the iris. Correct?

28:53.882 --> 28:57.469
We could put palm scanners in
the iris control system to prevent that.

28:57.482 --> 28:59.484
I assume they don't have palms.

29:00.643 --> 29:04.396
- Take who you need and do it, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

29:05.323 --> 29:07.325
Colonel, let's go see the boy.

29:15.604 --> 29:17.271
(groans)

29:17.363 --> 29:18.696
OK, that should...

29:19.242 --> 29:20.452
Teal'c?

29:26.042 --> 29:28.461
Colonel O'Neill, are you with Charlie now?

29:28.522 --> 29:30.525
And Mom's there?

29:31.803 --> 29:35.097
I think we may have a stowaway Reetou
who came back with us.

29:35.124 --> 29:36.291
Yeah.

29:37.403 --> 29:38.570
(alarm)

29:38.683 --> 29:43.605
(computer) Lock-down in progress.
Stand clear of all-level access points.

30:33.444 --> 30:35.447
- You all right?
- Strong Reetou.

30:45.445 --> 30:46.614
Damn it.

30:48.165 --> 30:49.542
Get a count?

30:49.644 --> 30:52.147
Four here,
plus that one in the control room.

30:52.205 --> 30:57.084
It's a terrorist team. They didn't wanna be
seen until their destruction had started.

30:57.085 --> 30:59.045
So what will they do?

30:59.125 --> 31:02.880
Some of them will try to leave the base
and start making a mess of things.

31:02.884 --> 31:04.260
How?

31:04.365 --> 31:08.443
They have cross-phasal explosives,
each one as powerful as a small nuke.

31:08.445 --> 31:12.805
I hate to tell you, but those four Reetou
rebels could level a couple of cities...

31:12.806 --> 31:14.807
and take a lot of people with 'em.

31:14.885 --> 31:16.261
Sweet.

31:18.846 --> 31:21.682
(computer) Emergency lighting enabled.

31:21.726 --> 31:26.604
We dimmed the lights for a better contrast
and shut down all access to this floor.

31:26.605 --> 31:30.192
- So, hopefully, they're trapped with us.
- Well, assume they are.

31:30.207 --> 31:33.919
We'll do a sweep of all three
access corridors, sealing as we go.

31:33.926 --> 31:35.511
Try to corral them.

31:35.606 --> 31:38.067
Jacob, Carter, Chu - C-8.

31:38.126 --> 31:40.587
Teal'c, Rothman, Brecker - C-3.

31:40.647 --> 31:43.901
Daniel, Plunkett, you're with me.
Let's move out.

31:50.447 --> 31:52.449
Seal blast door C-3 East.

31:56.807 --> 31:57.807
(rifle cocked)

32:10.327 --> 32:12.121
Reetou!

32:14.606 --> 32:15.858
Come on!

32:23.888 --> 32:25.891
Seal blast A-7 West.

32:43.528 --> 32:46.699
Jack, what happens if they
come through the door behind us?

32:47.409 --> 32:49.201
What?

32:49.769 --> 32:51.769
Don't do that!

33:04.808 --> 33:06.602
Damn it.

33:24.089 --> 33:25.089
Dad!

33:28.848 --> 33:31.309
- You OK?
- Not really.

33:34.730 --> 33:36.731
Get the damn thing!

33:40.409 --> 33:42.411
Selmak can take care of me.

33:44.490 --> 33:45.865
(distorted) Go!

35:15.052 --> 35:16.762
Hit the deck!

35:33.092 --> 35:35.302
- Mother!
- Don't shoot!

35:37.293 --> 35:38.710
Mother!

35:40.773 --> 35:42.565
(footsteps)

35:48.012 --> 35:49.764
Ah!

35:51.813 --> 35:53.315
Easy, sir.

35:54.052 --> 35:56.429
All right, that hurts.

36:03.014 --> 36:05.224
- Give me a count.
- I got one.

36:05.293 --> 36:07.086
I also eliminated one.

36:07.173 --> 36:10.885
We got two, and Mother got one.
I guess that makes five.

36:10.893 --> 36:13.811
- That should be all of them.
- (O'Neill) Let's make sure.

36:13.853 --> 36:17.273
- Take a team and do a sweep of the base.
- Yes, sir.

36:28.213 --> 36:29.798
(whispers) I'm sorry.

36:43.054 --> 36:44.429
Doc?

36:44.534 --> 36:45.534
Doc!

36:48.574 --> 36:50.701
Give me a hand over here. Let's go!

36:50.775 --> 36:52.735
Put him up on the bed.

36:52.813 --> 36:55.108
Easy.

37:05.894 --> 37:08.938
- What?
- I don't know.

37:13.695 --> 37:15.487
His pulse is very weak.

37:16.936 --> 37:18.938
I can stabilise him for now...

37:19.014 --> 37:22.393
but, remember, sir,
he has two major organs about to fail.

37:23.414 --> 37:26.458
Oh, come on. He's just a kid.

37:26.494 --> 37:30.373
- You've got all this fancy equipment...
- Colonel, I'm sorry...

37:30.375 --> 37:32.168
but I don't think so.

37:32.775 --> 37:35.152
(Jacob distorted) Let us take him.

37:37.695 --> 37:39.697
He will be in good hands.

37:39.775 --> 37:42.778
- Can the Tok'ra help him?
- Yes.

37:42.815 --> 37:45.150
Isn't he a little young to be a host?

37:45.215 --> 37:46.800
He is young...

37:46.896 --> 37:51.295
but the Tok'ra symbiote that we
introduce to his mind can teach him.

37:51.295 --> 37:54.757
He will grow up with the advantages
that great wisdom brings.

37:54.775 --> 37:58.403
Two key words there - "grow up".

37:58.817 --> 38:02.070
The Tok'ra are probably
the only way that'll happen, sir.

38:05.376 --> 38:06.751
Do it.

38:22.416 --> 38:26.088
Keep the TERs. We'll get you more
as soon as they become available.

38:49.898 --> 38:52.733
You know, there's another rule that says...

38:54.376 --> 38:58.130
it's OK to be sad when
you're saying goodbye to a new friend.

38:58.936 --> 39:01.440
I wanna stay with you, Jack.

39:04.896 --> 39:08.692
Jacob's gonna take you to a place
where you can get well.

39:10.177 --> 39:11.972
I can't do that.

39:12.059 --> 39:14.894
- But you know what?
- What?

39:14.938 --> 39:16.940
I'll come visit.

39:19.378 --> 39:21.463
You'll come visit.

39:22.297 --> 39:23.882
OK?

39:24.657 --> 39:26.826
I guess.

39:28.538 --> 39:30.331
(sobs)

39:45.858 --> 39:49.653
(distorted) I warn you,
the Reetou are guileful creatures.

39:49.659 --> 39:52.869
You are at the disadvantage
of not being able to sense them...

39:52.898 --> 39:54.900
as my Jaffa friend and I can.

39:54.978 --> 39:59.692
Well, we've installed the hand scanner,
so they can't open the iris at least.

40:03.898 --> 40:07.735
You are only one, Teal'c.
Please be diligent.

40:07.739 --> 40:11.617
They will not give up. They will
attempt to send more infiltrators.

40:26.940 --> 40:28.942
(undistorted) George.

40:32.619 --> 40:33.996
Bye, Dad.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.311
- You take care.
- You, too.
