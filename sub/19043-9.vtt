00:32.957 --> 00:34.156

Noodles?

01:08.152 --> 01:09.217
Yeah.

You're looking for a class?

01:10.687 --> 01:12.153
I mean, we have classes here.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.521
We have a spaghetti class.

01:13.523 --> 01:14.655
No, man, noodles.

01:14.657 --> 01:16.857
Like, noodles.

01:16.859 --> 01:19.159
Oh. That's dr. Baskets.

01:19.161 --> 01:21.027

01:22.096 --> 01:23.862
Okay. Hold on.

<i>Dale on tv: ...Spanish.</i>
<i>Not only am I the dean,</i>

01:25.699 --> 01:26.898
<i>I'm also a student.</i>

01:26.900 --> 01:28.399
I think you need
to get out here.

01:30.168 --> 01:32.001
Who's this
little raggedy ann?

01:33.870 --> 01:35.070
Pfff.

01:35.072 --> 01:37.505
Lady, somebody
will be right with you.

01:37.507 --> 01:39.406
<i>and I'm also the janitor.</i>

01:39.408 --> 01:41.341

01:41.343 --> 01:43.509
Get off me! I got a live
gun situation here!

01:43.511 --> 01:45.177
I'll shoot you in the mouth.

01:45.179 --> 01:46.411

01:46.413 --> 01:47.612
She's looking for noodles.

01:47.614 --> 01:48.746
- Who?
- Noodles.

01:48.748 --> 01:50.180
You. You, noodles.

01:50.182 --> 01:52.448
- Me? I ain't no noodles.
- Hey, what the--

01:52.450 --> 01:54.249
There's a thai place
up the street

01:54.251 --> 01:56.551
Called dr. Noodles if that's
what you're talking about.

01:56.553 --> 01:58.019
What the hell, dude?

01:58.021 --> 01:59.954
We clowned up and down
the west coast, man.

01:59.956 --> 02:01.221
You don't know who I am?

02:01.223 --> 02:02.455
You were a clown?

02:02.457 --> 02:04.089
Do I look like a clown
to you, trish?

02:04.091 --> 02:06.024
- No.
- Clowning, huh?

02:06.026 --> 02:07.925
Okay, I know
who you're looking for:

02:07.927 --> 02:10.227
A guy who looks just
like me but a lot fatter?

02:10.229 --> 02:12.195
Mm, just as fat.

02:12.197 --> 02:14.063
When are the trustees
coming in?

02:14.065 --> 02:15.964
- At 2.
- Okay.

02:15.966 --> 02:18.099
We got to get you
out of here.

02:19.201 --> 02:22.770
Estate sale. Dog friendly.

02:22.772 --> 02:25.806
Come on in.
Lots of good stuff.

02:25.808 --> 02:28.041
- Hey, mom?
- Yeah.

02:28.043 --> 02:30.476
I found those,
uh, those records.

02:30.478 --> 02:32.277
- Oh, records?
- Yeah.

02:32.279 --> 02:34.412
Oh, that would be good.
Vinyl's in right now.

02:34.414 --> 02:36.781
Yeah, and, uh,
meemaw's stroller.

02:36.783 --> 02:38.115
Oh, well, let's sell that

02:38.117 --> 02:39.649
Because, you know,
I can still walk.

02:39.651 --> 02:40.950
- I don't need it.
- Okay.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.551
And you wanted me
to move this?

02:42.553 --> 02:43.919
- Yeah, those things.
- This?

02:43.921 --> 02:45.787
I think they deter people
from coming in.

02:45.789 --> 02:46.888
Well, I'll separate them.

02:46.890 --> 02:48.055
Yeah. They're frightening.

02:48.057 --> 02:49.790
Be careful.
That one's heavy.

02:50.758 --> 02:52.258
Oh, boy. I didn't realize

02:52.260 --> 02:54.927
Meemaw had so much stuff.

02:54.929 --> 02:56.328
Hoo.

02:56.330 --> 02:58.563
Don't come down
on the price of that one.

02:58.565 --> 02:59.797
That's an antique.

02:59.799 --> 03:02.166
Mom, you have it at $1,200.

03:02.168 --> 03:04.434
Well, don't buy it--
oh.

03:04.436 --> 03:06.803
Welcome
to the estate sale.

03:06.805 --> 03:09.906
Oh. You head right

03:09.908 --> 03:11.774
This is a beauty.
Sheffield.

03:11.776 --> 03:13.442
I can do
a couple dollars off.

03:13.444 --> 03:14.776
It's a beauty, though.

03:14.778 --> 03:17.078
Oh. That's not supposed
to be out here.

03:17.080 --> 03:18.179
- Sorry.

03:18.181 --> 03:19.813

03:21.650 --> 03:22.649
- Hi.
- Good.

03:22.651 --> 03:24.150
Hi, chip.

03:24.152 --> 03:26.152
We're having an angry
teenager morning.

03:26.154 --> 03:27.520
Oh, pms?

03:27.522 --> 03:29.088
Crystal: What's pms?

03:30.590 --> 03:31.856
Can you explain it?

03:34.627 --> 03:35.959
Hey, chip,

03:35.961 --> 03:37.860
Your buddy
from the thunderdome is here.

03:37.862 --> 03:39.628
What are you talking about?

03:39.630 --> 03:41.296
She came by the university.

03:41.298 --> 03:43.197
I have a trustee's meeting
today. I can't have it.

03:43.199 --> 03:44.831
She's a real dirt person,
you know that?

03:44.833 --> 03:46.199
hey, chip.

03:46.201 --> 03:47.667
- Not now, martha.
- Okay.

03:47.669 --> 03:50.002
Well, let me know
if you need anything.

03:50.004 --> 03:52.471

03:52.473 --> 03:54.439
Oh, my god.

03:54.441 --> 03:57.008
Dude, you got a twin?

03:57.010 --> 03:59.010
- Yeah. Yeah.

03:59.012 --> 04:00.244
How are you?

04:03.282 --> 04:05.148
Uh, not good.

04:05.150 --> 04:06.449
I'm sorry to hear that.

04:06.451 --> 04:07.716
It got weird out there,
you know?

04:07.718 --> 04:08.783
Yeah.

04:08.785 --> 04:10.017
Hey, but, dude,

04:10.019 --> 04:11.651
This is why I came
to talk to you, man.

04:11.653 --> 04:13.152
You want to buy
this laptop?

04:13.154 --> 04:14.987
Where'd you get it?

04:14.989 --> 04:16.955
Ah, man, I jacked it
off this dude at starbucks.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.389
He asked me to watch it

04:18.391 --> 04:19.990
While he went to
the bathroom or whatever,

04:19.992 --> 04:21.958
But yeah, it's like
a good macintosh,

04:21.960 --> 04:23.993
And I'll give you
a good price.

04:23.995 --> 04:25.327
So, like, what
do you think, man?

04:25.329 --> 04:26.828
You want to buy
his computer?

04:26.830 --> 04:29.063
Let's, uh-- can we have
a chat over here?

04:29.065 --> 04:30.564
- Okay.
- Martha,

04:30.566 --> 04:33.567
Why don't you take
all the holiday stuff?

04:33.569 --> 04:34.968
- Well, d-
- and--

04:34.970 --> 04:36.703
Do you have
a baby jesus?

04:36.705 --> 04:38.404
I think I do in the back.

04:38.406 --> 04:41.907
And then I'll give you
a bundle price on it all.

04:41.909 --> 04:43.675
- Will you--
- and throw in--

04:43.677 --> 04:45.176
This paperweight?

04:45.178 --> 04:46.410
Yes. It's a--

04:46.412 --> 04:48.378
It's a glass pineapple.

04:49.814 --> 04:51.880
Oh, jim!

04:51.882 --> 04:53.848
Oh, I'm glad you made it.

04:53.850 --> 04:56.717
Hey, I put a box
of stuff together

04:56.719 --> 04:59.186
And set it aside
for you and the kids.

04:59.188 --> 05:00.587
Oh. Thanks.

05:00.589 --> 05:02.922
No, that's--
that's great, christine.

05:02.924 --> 05:04.390
Christine baskets.

05:04.392 --> 05:06.024
- It's so nice to meet you.
- I'm so rude.

05:06.026 --> 05:07.658
This is marissa hughes.

05:07.660 --> 05:10.160
She's bakersfield's
number 1 realtor.

05:10.162 --> 05:12.162
Oh. Thank you.

05:12.164 --> 05:13.663
We're just going to
pop into mom's house,

05:13.665 --> 05:15.031
And I'm going
to show her around

05:15.033 --> 05:16.399
So I can see
if there's, uh--

05:16.401 --> 05:17.433
Oh, what needs to be done.

05:17.435 --> 05:18.500
It's really charming.

05:18.502 --> 05:19.834
Lot of curb appeal.

05:19.836 --> 05:21.535
You know, I have
somebody coming out

05:21.537 --> 05:23.169
In a couple weeks
about the house.

05:23.171 --> 05:24.737
It's all taken care of.

05:24.739 --> 05:26.071
Don't worry about that.

05:26.073 --> 05:27.505
You got your hands full.

05:27.507 --> 05:28.939
I'm happy to help.

05:28.941 --> 05:30.273
Nice meeting you.

05:30.275 --> 05:31.574
Jim: You know,
do you think

05:31.576 --> 05:33.275
We can lose that
tree right there?

05:33.277 --> 05:36.111
This gravy boat
has a chip in it.

05:36.113 --> 05:38.213
How about a dollar?

05:38.215 --> 05:39.514
Hello.

05:40.949 --> 05:41.949
Oh.

05:41.951 --> 05:43.717
Uh, what?

05:43.719 --> 05:45.952
Uh, the gravy boat
has a chip in it.

05:45.954 --> 05:47.720
How about a dollar?

05:47.722 --> 05:49.288
Uh, dale.

05:49.290 --> 05:51.189
Could you take care
of this for me?

05:51.191 --> 05:53.024
Could you take over,
please?

05:53.026 --> 05:54.558
I'm a little busy.
I'm bargaining right now.

05:54.560 --> 05:55.959
Well,
I need your help.

05:55.961 --> 05:57.794
That's bakelite, martha.
Don't touch it.

05:57.796 --> 05:59.729
I need your help.
Take care of this woman.

05:59.731 --> 06:01.230
Can I help you?

06:01.232 --> 06:03.031
This gravy boat has a chip.

06:03.033 --> 06:04.766
Well, you broke it,
you bought it.

06:04.768 --> 06:06.033
That'll be a buck.

06:06.035 --> 06:08.568
A dollar, please,
or four quarters,

06:08.570 --> 06:10.303
Ten dimes, 20 nickels.
That'll work.

06:10.305 --> 06:11.837
Thank you very much.

06:12.805 --> 06:13.905
You want a receipt?

06:13.907 --> 06:15.139
Forget it. I don't have one.

06:15.141 --> 06:17.008
No. No. Sarah,
where are you going?

06:17.010 --> 06:19.543
He came all this way.
You're being so unfair.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.044
Sarah, I'm not kidding you.

06:21.046 --> 06:23.012
I will ground you from
everything for a month.

06:23.014 --> 06:24.680
- Come on, let's go.
- Get off that bike.

06:24.682 --> 06:26.481
Hey, excuse me.

06:26.483 --> 06:27.915
Excuse me.
What did you--

06:27.917 --> 06:29.483
Get back here!

06:34.221 --> 06:35.888
You okay?

06:35.890 --> 06:40.325
sarah is exploring
some boundaries right now.

06:40.327 --> 06:43.261
But crystal, she's
being a real trooper.

06:43.263 --> 06:44.362
Aren't you, sweetheart?

06:44.364 --> 06:45.596
Yeah.

06:45.598 --> 06:47.030
Well,
when I was her age,

06:47.032 --> 06:49.665
I fell over the transit
fonzarelli type, too.

06:49.667 --> 06:52.367
It's just a phase,
I hope.

06:52.369 --> 06:54.369
Just a phase.

06:54.371 --> 06:56.337
I'm here for you.

06:57.372 --> 06:58.638
Thanks.

07:06.880 --> 07:09.046
Baskets career college.
This is trish.

07:09.048 --> 07:11.581
Hey, trish. I'm having
a family emergency, okay?

07:11.583 --> 07:13.616
I need you to cover for me
at the trustees meeting.

07:13.618 --> 07:16.185
- Take notes, please.
-  <i>Okay. Is everything--</i>

07:16.187 --> 07:17.286
Thank you.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.758
there you are.

07:23.760 --> 07:25.693
You're in charge of
the yard sale now, okay?

07:25.695 --> 07:26.894
Don't sell the yard.

07:26.896 --> 07:28.428
I got things to do.

07:28.430 --> 07:30.897
Good luck with your
dust bowl friend.

07:30.899 --> 07:32.632
Hey, come on, dude.

07:32.634 --> 07:34.767
Like, just take it,
man. 75 bucks.

07:34.769 --> 07:36.368
I can't.
Listen-- listen, trinity.

07:36.370 --> 07:38.636
I'm on probation, okay?

07:38.638 --> 07:40.471
The guy comes out
of the starbucks bathroom,

07:40.473 --> 07:42.306
He sees his computer's missing,
he calls the cops.

07:42.308 --> 07:43.774
I can't have the cops
sniffing around me.

07:43.776 --> 07:44.875
I can't go to jail.

07:44.877 --> 07:47.310
All right, dude. Whatever.

07:47.312 --> 07:48.644
You changed.

07:48.646 --> 07:50.479
I have not--

07:50.481 --> 07:52.247
What happened to clowning?

07:52.249 --> 07:53.915
No. I don't clown
anymore, dude.

07:53.917 --> 07:55.416
I just wanted
some friggin' cash.

07:55.418 --> 07:57.217
I want to get back
on the train, okay?

07:57.219 --> 07:58.718
You got to stop running.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.719
You're never
going to outrun yourself.

08:02.221 --> 08:03.888
What?

08:03.890 --> 08:05.623
Did you find jesus?

08:07.593 --> 08:09.926
Okay, I know somebody
you can talk to.

08:09.928 --> 08:10.993
Follow me.

08:11.928 --> 08:13.428
Come on.

08:13.430 --> 08:15.263
This is kind of sharp.

08:15.265 --> 08:16.731
Hey, martha.

08:16.733 --> 08:17.998
Hey, chip.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.432
Look after
the yard sale, please.

08:19.434 --> 08:21.300
- Good catch.
- Wait. Chip.

08:21.302 --> 08:23.502
If I bought all these
old dishes,

08:23.504 --> 08:24.803
Would you do 20?

08:24.805 --> 08:25.837
What?

08:25.839 --> 08:27.471
Or the pat boone
records

08:27.473 --> 08:29.072
And that old calendar
for 10?

08:29.074 --> 08:31.007
All right,
you have to slow down.

08:31.009 --> 08:34.676
Okay? If you could
hold on to your horses,

08:34.678 --> 08:36.477
I will find a family member,

08:36.479 --> 08:39.179
And I'll ask them
about changing the price.

08:39.181 --> 08:40.780
No guarantees.

08:40.782 --> 08:43.282
Would you
check that hat, too?

08:43.284 --> 08:47.185
Um, I don't know if I'm
willing to part with it.

08:47.187 --> 08:48.953
Jim: So I figure
we rip up all the carpet,

08:48.955 --> 08:50.487
Put hard wood
through the whole place.

08:50.489 --> 08:51.654
Marissa:
Oh, that sounds great.

08:51.656 --> 08:52.821
And then some brand-new

08:52.823 --> 08:54.322
Stainless steel
appliances.

08:54.324 --> 08:56.123
- Modernize it.
- And maybe put a bay window

08:56.125 --> 08:57.591
There so you can look
out to the backyard--

08:57.593 --> 08:59.192
- Yes.
- ...To make it look bigger

08:59.194 --> 09:00.626
- Because I'm just gonna--
- oh, that sounds--

09:00.628 --> 09:01.994
Oh. Hi, christine.

09:01.996 --> 09:04.429
Hi. I thought
I would come in

09:04.431 --> 09:06.497
And check and see
how you two were doing.

09:06.499 --> 09:07.965
Oh, good, good, good.

09:07.967 --> 09:09.299
Uh, well, actually,

09:09.301 --> 09:11.100
I was just talking
with marissa

09:11.102 --> 09:13.202
About, uh,
the, uh, potential

09:13.204 --> 09:15.137
Of me buying
this place myself.

09:15.139 --> 09:17.939
Oh. Marissa,
could you excuse me?

09:17.941 --> 09:19.941
I want to talk
to my brother.

09:19.943 --> 09:21.542
- Oh. Of course. No problem.
- Thank you.

09:21.544 --> 09:22.776
I'll wait outside.

09:22.778 --> 09:24.277
Thank you.

09:27.648 --> 09:30.483
What-- you know, what-- what
do you have to worry about?

09:30.485 --> 09:32.485
I've already
talked to my lawyers,

09:32.487 --> 09:33.953
And they're looking into it,

09:33.955 --> 09:36.188
And actually they're
in contact with herb.

09:36.190 --> 09:38.890
Oh. You talked to herb?

09:38.892 --> 09:40.491
- I did. I did.
- Oh.

09:40.493 --> 09:41.859
Well, I just--

09:41.861 --> 09:43.727
I-- I just was surprised

09:43.729 --> 09:45.495
That it's
all happened so fast

09:45.497 --> 09:48.364
And you're over here,
you know, with a realtor,

09:48.366 --> 09:51.633
And I just-- it--
it's a whirlwind.

09:51.635 --> 09:54.502
I'm-- you know, I thought
we would put it on the market.

09:54.504 --> 09:56.237
You don't really
want to sell the house.

09:56.239 --> 09:57.972
Do you know what goes
into selling a house?

09:57.974 --> 10:00.040
You're going to have
people tromping through here

10:00.042 --> 10:02.308
Looking at, uh,
everything, you know--

10:02.310 --> 10:03.909
The-- is there mold?

10:03.911 --> 10:06.144
Is, uh, is there
water damage here?

10:06.146 --> 10:08.045
Inspectors--
inspectors come in,

10:08.047 --> 10:10.180
And they're-- it's going
to cost you a lot of money.

10:10.182 --> 10:11.881
Do you know anything
about inspectors?

10:11.883 --> 10:13.215
No.

10:15.051 --> 10:17.018
Um, well, maybe you're right.

10:17.020 --> 10:19.720
Maybe we should--
maybe we should do--

10:19.722 --> 10:22.589
You know business, and maybe
we should do it that way.

10:23.657 --> 10:24.757
Yeah.

10:24.759 --> 10:25.858
Well, good.

10:25.860 --> 10:27.025
And-- and marissa's great.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.560
Yeah. I like her and her...

10:29.562 --> 10:32.663
You know. She sees anything
in the sale she wants,

10:32.665 --> 10:35.732
Just, you know, give her
a hell of a deal on it.

10:37.235 --> 10:38.634
I'll see you later.

10:41.504 --> 10:43.203
- Hi, marissa.
- Hey.

10:47.574 --> 10:49.340
Jim: Did I leave my
tape measure in here?

10:50.275 --> 10:51.408
I got it.

10:53.611 --> 10:54.911
Okay, ma'am,

10:54.913 --> 10:56.712
If you want to go
with the sticker price,

10:56.714 --> 10:58.113
I won't have to go
up the chain of command,

10:58.115 --> 10:59.547
And you won't have to wait.

10:59.549 --> 11:00.881
Martha, tell everyone
I'll be back.

11:00.883 --> 11:02.415
Oh, hold on a second.

11:02.417 --> 11:04.283
Mrs. Baskets, before you go,

11:04.285 --> 11:07.119
Could you do $2.00
for the pat boone records

11:07.121 --> 11:08.753
And the broken necklace?

11:08.755 --> 11:10.421
- Excuse me.
- Mrs. Baskets?

11:10.423 --> 11:13.257
Is the hose attached
to the house for sale?

11:13.259 --> 11:15.058
You know what?
Could everybody please

11:15.060 --> 11:17.927
Just stop coming at me
for a minute?

11:17.929 --> 11:19.461
God.

11:20.629 --> 11:21.695
Oh.

11:22.863 --> 11:24.163
It works.

11:31.070 --> 11:32.937
Here's your change, sir.

11:32.939 --> 11:34.939
I think
you got the wrong guy.

11:34.941 --> 11:36.874
Oh. Sorry.

11:36.876 --> 11:39.543
What do you say?
Two lamps for 30 bucks.

11:39.545 --> 11:40.944
Okay. I don't know.

11:40.946 --> 11:42.278
I'm gonna have to
make a phone call.

11:42.280 --> 11:43.579
Two boones for a dollar.

11:43.581 --> 11:45.314
- Look, ma'am--
- how about 50 cents?

11:45.316 --> 11:46.748
Two boones
for 50 cents.

11:46.750 --> 11:48.583
-   <i>Hello.</i>
<i>- Mrs. Baskets,</i>

11:48.585 --> 11:52.119
There's a guy who wants
two lamps for $30.

11:52.121 --> 11:55.055
<i>Is that fair, or do you want</i>
<i>me to make a counter offer?</i>

11:55.057 --> 11:56.990
Nice to see you,
christine.

11:56.992 --> 11:58.758
I've got to go, martha.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.327
- Herb. Oh.
- Ohh.

12:01.329 --> 12:03.395
so nice to see you.

12:03.397 --> 12:04.796
How are you holding up?

12:04.798 --> 12:07.331
Oh, I don't think
it's all hit me yet.

12:07.333 --> 12:08.465
Uh-huh?

12:08.467 --> 12:10.300
So many loose ends
to take care of.

12:10.302 --> 12:13.903
Well, let's take a look
at this will, shall we?

12:13.905 --> 12:15.003
Yes.

12:17.906 --> 12:21.607
Have you got an answer
on the lamps yet?

12:21.609 --> 12:23.141
You know what, sir?

12:23.143 --> 12:26.310
Let me call the grandson
of the dead lamp owner.

12:26.312 --> 12:27.912
He might know
if there's, like,

12:27.914 --> 12:32.082
A sentimental reason
why it's more expensive.

12:33.250 --> 12:34.617
Ma'am. Ohh.

12:34.619 --> 12:35.918
<i>Hello.</i>

12:35.920 --> 12:39.420
Hey, chip,
could you do two lamps

12:39.422 --> 12:40.687
<i>For $30?</i>

12:40.689 --> 12:42.121
Martha, don't
telemarket me, please.

12:42.123 --> 12:45.224
Chip. So good to see you.

12:45.226 --> 12:46.692
Been a minute.

12:46.694 --> 12:49.061
Yeah, man. What's up?

12:49.063 --> 12:50.796
I still have you
on the schedule.

12:50.798 --> 12:52.898
We have a 60-day
probation period,
so he's still good.

12:52.900 --> 12:55.567
Um, jode, I should tell you
that I'm quitting.

12:55.569 --> 12:57.969
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

12:57.971 --> 13:00.905
Hey, guys, chip quit.
Who wants to work on Saturday?

13:00.907 --> 13:02.907
You know what? I may
have somebody for you.

13:02.909 --> 13:05.542
This is, uh, trinity,

13:05.544 --> 13:07.143
And she is
a really good chef

13:07.145 --> 13:09.311
And makes a killer hotdog.

13:09.313 --> 13:11.146
Okay. Cool.

13:12.248 --> 13:13.915
I really like your tattoos.

13:13.917 --> 13:15.449
- You do?
- Yeah, it's cool.

13:15.451 --> 13:17.284
So you ever done
the fast food thing?

13:17.286 --> 13:19.653
Oh, yeah.
I worked at a starbucks,

13:19.655 --> 13:21.621
Like, a long, long time ago.

13:21.623 --> 13:22.755
That's great.

13:22.757 --> 13:24.289
Sorry.
Like, what's going on?

13:24.291 --> 13:26.291
You're, like, trying
to get me a job at arby's?

13:26.293 --> 13:27.558
Jode and I go way back.

13:27.560 --> 13:28.792
He's a good guy.

13:28.794 --> 13:30.426
He's a-- a gigolo?

13:30.428 --> 13:31.493
- Juggolo.
- Juggolo.

13:31.495 --> 13:32.560
- He's a juggolo.
- No way.

13:32.562 --> 13:33.761
- Yeah.
- Whoo-whoo.

13:33.763 --> 13:36.063
Hey, icp.
That's my true family.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.165
- That's--
- family. Family, yeah.

13:38.167 --> 13:39.566
Family.

13:39.568 --> 13:41.401
Hey, what kind of meat
you like?

13:41.403 --> 13:43.970
Beef, pork, steak?

13:43.972 --> 13:45.471
I'm a vegetarian.

13:45.473 --> 13:46.905
We got liquid cheese.

13:46.907 --> 13:48.940
We'll have one cup
of liquid cheese

13:48.942 --> 13:50.508
And an application,
please.

13:50.510 --> 13:53.310
Ishmael, cup of cheese.

13:53.312 --> 13:54.778
And a application.

13:54.780 --> 13:56.780
He's putting
the application
in a cup.

13:56.782 --> 13:59.249
Not the application.
The cheese.

13:59.251 --> 14:00.984
Ah, man. One minute.

14:12.095 --> 14:14.696
I want to be with you.

14:14.698 --> 14:16.264
You are with me.

14:16.266 --> 14:17.732
No. You know.

14:25.807 --> 14:28.108
Heath, uh, I don't--

14:28.110 --> 14:30.009
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

14:30.011 --> 14:31.510
I don't--
we talked about this.

14:31.512 --> 14:33.678
- Shh.
- I don't--

14:35.148 --> 14:38.182
- I'm not sure if I--

14:42.619 --> 14:44.353
- I got to go.
- But, sarah--

14:45.288 --> 14:47.122
Where are you going?

14:47.124 --> 14:48.189
Sarah.

14:49.124 --> 14:51.058
What the hell.

14:51.060 --> 14:52.626
Hi, guys.

14:52.628 --> 14:53.793
Is keith here?

14:53.795 --> 14:54.994
You mean heath?

14:54.996 --> 14:56.662
Heath, keith.
Does not matter.

14:56.664 --> 14:58.296
You guys have
a mimosa, by chance?

14:58.298 --> 15:00.364
Sarah. Sarah!

15:00.366 --> 15:02.566
Hey, keith.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.334
I thought that was
your motorsickle.

15:04.336 --> 15:06.235
I got a van full of stuff

15:06.237 --> 15:08.036
For you skateboarders
and ragamuffins.

15:08.038 --> 15:10.304
- Dad.
- Yeah, man, sure, totally.

15:10.306 --> 15:11.805
- Hopefully you--
- it's heath, by the way.

15:11.807 --> 15:13.840
Oh, yeah. Heath, keith.
Whatever it is.

15:13.842 --> 15:16.175
So I got safety stuff--

15:16.177 --> 15:20.478
Helmets and protection
for everybody.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.179
Let's see,
what have we got here?

15:22.181 --> 15:24.748
Who likes wonder bread?

15:24.750 --> 15:26.216
There we go.

15:26.218 --> 15:29.652
And some prophylactics,
gentlemen?

15:29.654 --> 15:31.220
Now, these have been
in the car,

15:31.222 --> 15:32.854
So they probably
have a little bit

15:32.856 --> 15:35.256
Of stretchability to them,
if you know what I mean,

15:35.258 --> 15:36.557
For your old penis.

15:38.026 --> 15:41.561
And, sarah, I got you
one with hearts on it.

15:41.563 --> 15:42.728
There you go.

15:42.730 --> 15:43.929
What are you doing?

15:43.931 --> 15:45.397
I'm just, uh...

15:45.399 --> 15:47.565
You know. I think
it's important

15:47.567 --> 15:49.333
For everybody
to protect themselves.

15:49.335 --> 15:50.767
You know, you guys,
have a good time,

15:50.769 --> 15:53.903
But protection is--
is key.

15:53.905 --> 15:56.171
Okay, I'm out of here.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.240
Oh, my god.

15:59.242 --> 16:00.608
- Dad.
- Yes.

16:00.610 --> 16:02.676
Can you maybe
give me a ride back?

16:05.112 --> 16:07.446
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
come on in.

16:10.082 --> 16:11.615
Sarah, where are you going?

16:11.617 --> 16:13.750
- I got to go.
- Sarah,

16:13.752 --> 16:15.885
Your dad sucks.

16:15.887 --> 16:17.519
Dude, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

16:17.521 --> 16:20.121
You're taking her away?
That's bullshit.

16:20.123 --> 16:22.723
Oh, he's got a mouth
on him, does he?

16:22.725 --> 16:24.725
Well, you ever seen
one of these, son?

16:24.727 --> 16:27.360
It's called a gun, and anybody
can get on in this country.

16:27.362 --> 16:29.462
It's super easy, and all
I got to do is just--

16:31.232 --> 16:33.799
You can get another one
of those at pottery barn.

16:38.570 --> 16:39.703
Sarah, get in.

16:40.638 --> 16:42.271
It's locked.

16:45.607 --> 16:46.773
Don't move!

16:46.775 --> 16:48.441
Don't you move!

16:55.215 --> 16:56.582
Loaded italian?

16:56.584 --> 16:58.884
Uh, limited time only menu?

16:58.886 --> 17:00.986
Close. Signature.

17:00.988 --> 17:02.387
Forget it.
No, man, I can't do this.

17:02.389 --> 17:03.888
Like, I'm not
cut out for this.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.890
Relax. You sound like chip
on his first day.

17:05.892 --> 17:08.325
I got you. Arby's
takes care of their own.

17:08.327 --> 17:10.060
Thanks, arby.

17:10.062 --> 17:13.396
Study up. It's all good.
You're doing good.

17:15.298 --> 17:17.832
Thanks for bringing
trinity in on this, man.

17:17.834 --> 17:19.767
Dude, she is beautiful.

17:19.769 --> 17:20.968
Hey, don't get weird.

17:20.970 --> 17:22.869
Be a good kid.
She needs this.

17:30.343 --> 17:32.010
- See you.
- Okay.

17:35.314 --> 17:36.414
Hey, sarah?

17:37.749 --> 17:39.516
I love you.

17:39.518 --> 17:41.417
I love you, too, dad.

17:41.419 --> 17:43.252
Remember to remind
your mother of that

17:43.254 --> 17:44.953
From time to time.
It would help me out.

17:44.955 --> 17:46.087
Okay?

17:47.856 --> 17:49.289
Wear your helmet.

18:06.206 --> 18:09.540
Oh, hey, christine.
Come on in.

18:09.542 --> 18:12.175
I'm just finishing
a lousy burger

18:12.177 --> 18:16.011
And worse fries, cold fries.
You want some cold fries?

18:16.013 --> 18:17.045
No, thank you.

18:17.047 --> 18:18.980
And watching this moron.

18:18.982 --> 18:21.282
- Oh, god, is she awful.
-  <i>...About grace.</i>

18:21.284 --> 18:22.783
She's really a bitch.

18:22.785 --> 18:24.217
<i>I'm not talking about</i>
<i>grace from above.</i>

18:24.219 --> 18:25.618
- Grace who?
- <i>I'm not talking</i>

18:25.620 --> 18:27.519
<i>About a friend</i>
<i>that you have.</i>

18:27.521 --> 18:29.153
<i>I'm talking about</i>

18:29.155 --> 18:32.389
The student loan
grace period.

18:32.391 --> 18:33.690
Now, you know--

18:33.692 --> 18:35.491
I went down
and saw herb today

18:35.493 --> 18:37.659
And learned something
very interesting.

18:37.661 --> 18:39.694
- Uh-huh.
- Apparently,

18:39.696 --> 18:41.862
You already got your share.

18:41.864 --> 18:43.897
What are you talking about?

18:43.899 --> 18:46.466
Dad got you
a quizno's franchise.

18:46.468 --> 18:48.501
I got a toaster
when I got married.

18:48.503 --> 18:50.636
Dad paid for your college.

18:50.638 --> 18:52.537
I was a cheerleader.

18:52.539 --> 18:54.705
Dad bought you
a fancy new car.

18:54.707 --> 18:56.039
I drove a jalopy.

18:56.041 --> 18:58.074
dad bought you all that stuff

18:58.076 --> 19:00.810
Because you were
the boy in the family.

19:00.812 --> 19:03.145
I was the girl.
I got nothing.

19:03.147 --> 19:04.346
- No.
- That's true.

19:04.348 --> 19:05.880
He treated us the same.

19:05.882 --> 19:07.348
But mom didn't see it
that way.

19:07.350 --> 19:10.351
She kept track of each thing
that dad bought you.

19:10.353 --> 19:12.720
Everything that dad
did for you,

19:12.722 --> 19:15.689
Mom made sure
to write it down.

19:15.691 --> 19:17.090
Oh, mom.

19:17.092 --> 19:20.726
And that's why she left
everything to me,

19:20.728 --> 19:22.561
Including the house.

19:22.563 --> 19:24.829
Oh, that's rich.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.997
What are you going to do
with all that money, huh?

19:26.999 --> 19:28.599
That's not your concern.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.300
You have
no idea about finance.

19:30.302 --> 19:31.768
I'm a businessman.

19:31.770 --> 19:33.336
I've watched you
since I got here,

19:33.338 --> 19:35.371
And you know what?
You don't have a clue.

19:35.373 --> 19:37.606
You've been spending
money willy-nilly

19:37.608 --> 19:40.842
In the costco, buying
every flavor of drink
that they had.

19:40.844 --> 19:42.944
Looked like a rainbow
in that garage of yours,

19:42.946 --> 19:44.512
Packed to the top.

19:44.514 --> 19:47.348
If somebody gave you
a quizno's franchise.

19:47.350 --> 19:49.149
You'd run it
into the ground.

19:49.151 --> 19:51.351
Jim, that doesn't concern you.

19:51.353 --> 19:54.053
Have you ever made
a sound financial decision

19:54.055 --> 19:56.021
In your entire life?

19:56.023 --> 19:57.956
I never had a chance
to make any decision,

19:57.958 --> 20:00.024
But now I do, and I'm
going to make it.

20:00.026 --> 20:02.026
And I'm going to do
what I want.

20:02.028 --> 20:03.560
I'm going to live my life.

20:03.562 --> 20:06.996
And I'm going to thank mom
every day for it

20:06.998 --> 20:10.733
Because she made it fair.
She made it equal.

20:10.735 --> 20:12.735
And another thing.

20:12.737 --> 20:14.837
Suzy ormond is not a bitch.

20:14.839 --> 20:16.705
She's a classy blonde.

20:28.250 --> 20:30.517
Oh. Hi.

20:30.519 --> 20:32.552
Oh, do you want to go in here?

20:32.554 --> 20:33.719
Okay.

20:34.921 --> 20:36.388
Housekeeping!

20:46.665 --> 20:48.899
well, that was a wild one.

20:48.901 --> 20:52.502
How did the, uh,
trustees meeting go?

20:52.504 --> 20:53.903
Well, there was--

20:53.905 --> 20:56.572
The beginning,
they had small talk,

20:56.574 --> 21:00.441
And, uh, they made
comments on the pastries.

21:00.443 --> 21:02.943
Good. Are there any left?

21:02.945 --> 21:06.780
No. And there was
a general sense

21:06.782 --> 21:09.215
That the college was
not going in the--

21:09.217 --> 21:11.083
Was going
in a bad direction.

21:11.085 --> 21:14.953
They were all pretty miffed
about you not being there.

21:14.955 --> 21:18.089
Well, I mean, you told them I
had a family emergency, right?

21:18.091 --> 21:21.025
You told donnie and pauline
and carla that, right?

21:21.027 --> 21:23.727
Yes. Then they took a vote

21:23.729 --> 21:26.262
And decided to remove you
as president.

21:27.564 --> 21:29.898
Remove me as--

21:29.900 --> 21:34.068
It's baskets career college,
as in dale baskets.

21:34.070 --> 21:35.469
I mean, come on.

21:35.471 --> 21:37.604
The bylaws say they can.

21:37.606 --> 21:38.972
The bylaws?

21:38.974 --> 21:41.441
And the articles of
a for-profit college are--

21:41.443 --> 21:42.975
Who's going to run it?

21:42.977 --> 21:44.576
Who's going to run the thing?

21:44.578 --> 21:45.977
I mean, honestly.

21:45.979 --> 21:47.311
They took a vote,

21:47.313 --> 21:49.045
And they chose me.

21:51.815 --> 21:53.582
They chose you?

21:53.584 --> 21:54.783
Yep.

21:54.785 --> 21:56.251
Me.

21:56.253 --> 21:58.419
Trish, I mean, you're--

21:58.421 --> 22:00.888
You're my most loyal
friend here.

22:00.890 --> 22:02.456
It was more money.

22:02.458 --> 22:03.957
Yeah, but I'm a white male.

22:03.959 --> 22:05.625
I'm supposed to make
more money than you.

22:05.627 --> 22:07.493
Not anymore.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.895
Have you ever been
president of anything?

22:10.897 --> 22:12.463
No.

22:12.465 --> 22:15.466
Okay, christine,
I'll need your I.D.

22:15.468 --> 22:17.334
And a copy of
the death certificate.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.601
Here you go.

22:18.603 --> 22:20.002
Thank you.

22:26.108 --> 22:28.509
Okay, your deposit
is all set.

22:28.511 --> 22:30.477
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

22:30.479 --> 22:32.645
- That's it?
- Yes, ma'am.

22:32.647 --> 22:33.912
Oh.

22:33.914 --> 22:36.247
Uh, thank you.

22:36.249 --> 22:37.481
My pleasure.

22:37.483 --> 22:39.749
My mom died, you know.

22:39.751 --> 22:42.284
I guess that makes me
an orphan.

22:42.286 --> 22:44.519
So sorry to hear that.

22:44.521 --> 22:47.021
She believed in me,
you know.

22:47.023 --> 22:48.856
She really believe in me.

22:48.858 --> 22:50.691
That's why she----

22:50.693 --> 22:53.760
You know, she knew
I could handle this.

22:53.762 --> 22:55.595
She-- she lo----

22:55.597 --> 22:57.930
She loved----
she loved me.

22:57.932 --> 22:59.598
She really loved me.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.533
Oh. I beg your--

23:05.103 --> 23:06.269
Sorry.

23:07.271 --> 23:08.838
Oh, look at that.

23:08.840 --> 23:11.340
Is that-- is that you
and your daughter?

23:11.342 --> 23:14.443
- Mm-hmm.
- So cute.

23:14.445 --> 23:17.612
Oh, I love you. I love her.

23:17.614 --> 23:20.281
Oh, thank you so much.
I love everybody.

23:23.685 --> 23:25.485
Oh, you're so tiny.

23:25.487 --> 23:27.553
How did that get
that baby out of you?

23:29.289 --> 23:31.490
Oh. Ha ha.

23:31.492 --> 23:34.493
I don't know.
Isn't this crazy?

23:34.495 --> 23:35.994
I don't even know you.

23:35.996 --> 23:37.061
Oh.

23:38.063 --> 23:39.897
Can I get a picture with you?

23:39.899 --> 23:41.498
I don't want to forget this.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.399
Do you like selfies?

23:43.401 --> 23:47.469
Hey. Does somebody at the bank
know how to use a ipad?

23:47.471 --> 23:49.737
I want to get a photo
with everyone.

23:49.739 --> 23:51.371
Sorry. I'm a wreck!

23:51.373 --> 23:53.072
Ha ha ha!

23:53.074 --> 23:54.573
Yeah.

25:32.470 --> 25:35.004
What kind of a clown
do you think you are?

25:35.006 --> 25:37.606
You know, the sad clown,
the distraught clown.

25:37.608 --> 25:39.707
More like
a dead-inside clown.

25:42.677 --> 25:45.679
-What are you doing? Chip!
-I'll pick those up.
