03:00.240 --> 03:01.080
Hey.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.160
I'm Josefine.

03:04.640 --> 03:05.680
What's your name?

03:08.520 --> 03:09.520
You're cute.

03:12.360 --> 03:13.720
Are you all alone?

03:15.240 --> 03:16.240
Good dog.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.120
Hold on.

03:18.720 --> 03:19.920
Steady on.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.440
Right.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.880
Josefine, come on, let's go.

03:23.960 --> 03:27.200
-Share with your sister, please.
-I didn't buy her any!

03:27.720 --> 03:29.080
She's very cute, honey.

03:29.160 --> 03:32.640
But you shouldn't pet other people's dogs.
We've talked about that.

03:34.240 --> 03:37.160
But this is exactly
the kind of dog I want, Mom!

03:37.240 --> 03:39.680
You can have one
when you're old enough to look after it.

03:39.760 --> 03:42.240
You said that last year.
And again this year.

03:42.320 --> 03:43.640
When am I old enough?

03:46.000 --> 03:47.880
Don't ask me. I'm on vacation.

03:47.960 --> 03:50.240
-Mom's in charge.
-Never!

03:50.960 --> 03:51.800
Mom.

03:51.880 --> 03:56.440
Honey, it's a huge responsibility.
You're still just a kid.

03:57.400 --> 04:01.120
Okay? But we did buy you
a really fantastic Christmas present.

04:01.880 --> 04:03.520
You'll love it. Come on.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.880
Josefine, get in the car.

04:04.960 --> 04:07.080
Christmas vacation.
We've a ferry to catch.

04:17.560 --> 04:19.560
<i>Please return to your cars.</i>

04:22.520 --> 04:25.200
-Technologically challenged much?
-It's just not working.

04:25.280 --> 04:27.560
-I'll get it working.
-Time for a new car?

04:28.400 --> 04:30.920
-Time to earn your own money?
-What do you mean?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.880
-You little gnat.
-Don't call him that.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.520
Just let me. Did you know…

04:34.600 --> 04:38.280
-You're stuck in the same dead-end job.
-Stop it!

04:38.360 --> 04:41.440
-If anyone needs a new job, it's you.
-Did I touch a nerve?

04:41.520 --> 04:44.200
-You're the one who raised your voice.
-Shut up.

05:04.520 --> 05:05.720
Ask for directions.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.560
This place sucks.

05:08.360 --> 05:10.720
Hang on. I'll ask for directions.

05:11.880 --> 05:12.880
Hiya.

05:13.400 --> 05:17.920
We're looking for 1, Skovvangen.
Our GPS isn't working, so do you…

05:18.000 --> 05:20.480
It's across the island.
Follow the coastal road.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.880
Perfect. Coastal road. Did you get that?

05:22.960 --> 05:24.280
-Perfect. Thanks.
-Thank you.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.800
-Merry Christmas.
-I had it under control.

05:26.880 --> 05:27.880
Well, excuse me.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.320
Is this the right way?
She said "coastal road."

05:40.400 --> 05:42.480
It's easier to cut across the island.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.160
Is there even a town here?

05:48.800 --> 05:51.400
-Where are all the shops?
-Shops?

05:51.480 --> 05:54.200
-Where are the others?
-What others?

05:54.280 --> 05:56.960
-The other people, Dad.
-What do you need them for?

05:57.040 --> 05:59.760
You've got us.
You're spending Christmas with the family.

05:59.840 --> 06:02.280
I brought some <i>Curious George </i>books.
You used to love those.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.360
"I love the cute monkey."

06:04.440 --> 06:06.040
You're just hilarious, Dad.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.720
Your big brother
loved<i> Curious George</i> as a kid.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.960
He'd walk around naked
and sometimes poop on the floor.

06:12.040 --> 06:14.280
-What's so funny?
<i>-</i>Be nice to him!

06:14.360 --> 06:15.520
Let's have a good time.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.880
<i>-</i>Come on, kids!
-Let's hear you.

06:24.320 --> 06:25.160
Come on, Jose.

06:25.240 --> 06:26.840
Sing along, grumpy boots.

06:29.280 --> 06:30.840
Come on, Jose.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.920
-Stop it!
-What the hell are you doing, little turd?

06:34.000 --> 06:36.160
-Big turd.
-You're so annoying.

06:36.240 --> 06:38.240
-Kids!
-Not while I'm driving.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.320
-Are you okay?
-What happened?

06:52.760 --> 06:53.800
What's that?

06:56.160 --> 06:57.840
Is that tar?

06:57.920 --> 06:59.240
Does tar look like that?

06:59.760 --> 07:01.360
Maybe it's oil or something.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.520
Maybe it happened on the ferry.

07:04.040 --> 07:05.600
The car got scratched too.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.760
That might be an old scratch.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.200
There's more over here.

07:25.280 --> 07:28.240
Honey? Don't wander off, okay? Stay close.

07:35.440 --> 07:37.040
Did you see the fence?

07:42.040 --> 07:43.200
Mads, someone's coming.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.200
Hey!

07:52.280 --> 07:54.000
Get away from there! Now!

07:55.880 --> 07:57.280
Josefine, come on.

07:57.360 --> 08:00.240
-Don't let her just run around out there.
-I know.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.800
-And you can't stop here.
-No, that was just…

08:03.880 --> 08:04.720
Listen,

08:04.800 --> 08:08.400
I stopped the car for a second.
I thought we'd hit something.

08:08.480 --> 08:09.840
I'm really sorry.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.360
Come on, honey.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.720
Get your kids and get in the car.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.880
-We hit a pothole. Let me check…
-This is a private road.

08:18.960 --> 08:22.400
If people stopping is a problem,
you should signpost that.

08:22.480 --> 08:23.880
Ever think about that?

08:26.600 --> 08:29.880
I'm sorry. We didn't know.
We're on Christmas vacation.

08:30.560 --> 08:33.160
-I'm Charlotte Svane--
-Great. You need to leave now.

08:34.640 --> 08:38.760
We're looking for 1, Skovvangen.
I'm guessing it's just straight ahead?

08:38.840 --> 08:40.240
Follow the coastal road.

08:41.440 --> 08:42.480
Definitely.

08:44.840 --> 08:45.680
Thank you.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.920
What's behind the fence?

08:52.960 --> 08:55.120
Come on, Josefine. Get in the car.

08:59.360 --> 09:02.520
Weren't we lucky to meet such a great guy?

09:02.600 --> 09:05.120
He said to follow the coastal road, honey.

09:05.200 --> 09:07.720
That's what I always say, kids.

09:07.800 --> 09:10.640
Countryfolk are just wonderful.
They really are.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.080
Well, this is just…

09:36.160 --> 09:38.520
It might not be exactly like the pictures.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.600
-Do we even have electricity?
-No.

09:41.280 --> 09:44.400
I'll dig a hole in the backyard
for you for your morning dump.

09:44.480 --> 09:47.240
Seriously. You've got to be joking.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.640
Tell me we didn't pay full price for this.

10:01.640 --> 10:03.880
Sweetheart? Come on.

10:10.120 --> 10:11.160
Try again, honey.

10:11.720 --> 10:13.560
-It's not working.
-How about now?

10:13.640 --> 10:14.960
Just the living room.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.200
-Can I have that room?
-That's Kasper's.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.120
Yours is next to ours.

10:21.200 --> 10:24.480
We've only got one fuse left.
We need to get some more.

10:24.560 --> 10:26.680
-Did you find the router?
-No, Kasper.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.880
There's no Wi-Fi, is there?

10:28.960 --> 10:31.600
Deal with it.
Do a puzzle or play with a stick.

10:33.840 --> 10:35.240
Help me with the luggage.

10:35.320 --> 10:37.040
This is pretty cozy, huh?

10:38.480 --> 10:40.360
I'm going out to look around.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.880
Hang on, honey. Let's unpack first.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.960
Then we'll make
some Christmas decorations.

10:47.640 --> 10:49.600
Then we'll lay some plans for later.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.440
Why don't you just make a garland?

13:05.520 --> 13:07.160
I don't want to!

13:07.240 --> 13:08.360
Is it tricky, honey?

13:08.440 --> 13:10.000
Seriously, guys!

13:10.080 --> 13:12.800
-Do we have to make decorations?
-Then make marzipan instead.

13:12.880 --> 13:15.120
-Hi!
-Hey, where did you go?

13:15.200 --> 13:19.760
I found this cool place, a creepy barn
full of old things and tractors and stuff.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.240
What barn?

13:21.320 --> 13:23.360
We need to know where you go.

13:23.440 --> 13:25.200
Take off your coat. Sit down.

13:26.520 --> 13:29.760
Kasper, look!
I pimped my Christmas decoration.

13:29.840 --> 13:32.080
-All in on the gold, huh?
-Just straight up gold.

13:32.160 --> 13:33.680
-Super cool.
-Thanks.

13:33.760 --> 13:35.760
Honey, would you get the scissors?

13:36.720 --> 13:37.560
Sure.

13:37.640 --> 13:40.480
Listen. Why don't you make a star?

13:40.560 --> 13:44.960
There's paper, a glue stick,
and all the cookies you can eat.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.000
Thanks.

13:48.480 --> 13:50.960
We did hit something with the car.

13:51.040 --> 13:54.160
-I don't think so.
-It was just a pothole.

13:54.240 --> 13:55.560
But I heard a noise.

13:55.640 --> 13:57.040
No, you didn't.

13:57.120 --> 13:59.000
If we hit something, we'd have seen it.

13:59.080 --> 14:00.800
Then what was the black goo?

14:01.360 --> 14:03.760
Jose, stop, all right? And join in.

14:03.840 --> 14:07.160
Okay? You love making decorations.
It's fun. We're on vacation.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.920
You're on vacation!

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
-Jose!
-I don't want to.

14:11.080 --> 14:14.520
No, thanks. You decide everything
without ever asking what I want.

14:14.600 --> 14:15.840
That's not true.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.880
It is. You're seriously annoying.

14:22.680 --> 14:24.360
Hey! Josefine.

14:25.080 --> 14:27.000
-Where are you going?
-To the fence.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.560
-Leave the bike, please.
-No, I'm going to the fence.

14:29.640 --> 14:31.080
No one's going anywhere.

14:31.160 --> 14:33.560
We hit something.
Maybe an animal got hurt.

14:33.640 --> 14:34.640
We can't do anything.

14:34.720 --> 14:37.720
It's a private road.
We're not allowed there. Period.

14:38.520 --> 14:40.560
-Dad?
-I agree with Mom.

14:41.160 --> 14:44.280
You heard what the man said.
Leave the bike. Come on in.

14:46.360 --> 14:47.280
Jose.

14:47.360 --> 14:49.200
Go to your room and calm down. Now.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.160
It's not funny, Kasper. Go on in!

15:14.040 --> 15:15.360
Still no connection?

15:16.560 --> 15:17.560
No.

15:19.720 --> 15:20.920
Are you coming in?

15:21.960 --> 15:23.000
No.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.680
-Okay.
-Or wait…

15:28.760 --> 15:31.320
Why don't I… We needed a fuse, right?

15:32.480 --> 15:33.320
Yes.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.120
Great. I'll get it.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.520
You look good when you're shopping.

15:52.800 --> 15:53.680
Do you work here?

15:55.400 --> 15:56.360
Yes.

15:57.120 --> 16:00.480
I saw you at the dock this morning.
When we arrived.

16:03.360 --> 16:04.600
Do you need anything?

16:06.120 --> 16:06.960
Yes.

16:07.040 --> 16:11.000
-We need fuses like this one.
-In the metal box over there.

16:13.120 --> 16:14.240
Thanks.

16:24.920 --> 16:25.960
Hi.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.560
Svane?

16:30.160 --> 16:32.480
-You're renting the Jespersen house?
-Yes.

16:33.680 --> 16:37.880
-We don't get a lot of tourists.
-Really? But it's so beautiful.

16:39.480 --> 16:40.560
I'm Charlotte.

16:43.480 --> 16:46.400
Karen. I own the shop
with my granddaughter.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.440
Møller said you had an accident.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.680
No, we just hit a pothole. It was nothing.

16:55.160 --> 16:56.560
Stick to the coastal road.

16:59.080 --> 17:01.080
Can we buy a Christmas tree somewhere?

17:01.760 --> 17:05.000
We're staying for Christmas,
so we were wondering…

17:05.080 --> 17:05.920
No.

17:06.840 --> 17:10.880
We believe trees belong in the forest.
With their roots in the ground.

17:10.960 --> 17:13.880
-Alive.
-Of course. The climate.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.280
Stick to the coastal road.
Come to me if you have any questions.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.480
Then you'll have a great holiday.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.400
Until you go back home.

17:31.120 --> 17:32.000
We're on…

17:32.960 --> 17:35.280
vacation here. My family and I.

17:37.840 --> 17:42.280
I could use a hand figuring out
how to spend time on the island…

17:43.280 --> 17:46.800
-If you have some time off?
-I don't.

17:48.440 --> 17:50.160
Don't you ever have time off?

17:56.240 --> 17:58.720
Well, I only asked because…

18:00.920 --> 18:02.080
Thanks for…

18:11.200 --> 18:13.520
The dock. At sunrise. Tomorrow.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.120
Sure.

18:18.480 --> 18:19.680
See you then.

18:47.840 --> 18:48.680
Can I come in?

18:58.640 --> 18:59.680
Honey.

19:00.840 --> 19:01.920
We're your parents.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.920
It's our job to look after you.
And decide for you.

19:05.880 --> 19:08.640
Perhaps we're extra careful with you.

19:08.720 --> 19:10.720
Whenever you do what you want,

19:10.800 --> 19:13.360
you break an arm
or have other crazy accidents.

19:13.440 --> 19:14.720
I'm not a kid.

19:16.720 --> 19:17.800
Come on now.

19:19.040 --> 19:21.120
Listen, I think you're cool.

19:21.920 --> 19:22.960
I really do.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.240
You want to be all grown up.

19:25.920 --> 19:28.920
But you don't need to be
in such a hurry, okay?

19:31.280 --> 19:32.120
Honey?

19:32.880 --> 19:36.120
Come and join us if you want.
We'd really like that.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.880
Everything will be all right.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.960
We did hit something with the car.

19:43.040 --> 19:45.760
And I saw more black goo in the field.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.480
Come out when you're ready. Okay, sweetie?

23:03.520 --> 23:04.760
Come to me.

23:05.520 --> 23:07.000
I'll help you.

24:37.480 --> 24:39.800
