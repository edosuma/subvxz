WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:04.210
&lt;♪&gt;

00:07.380 --> 00:09.090
[MAL] WE SPENT MY STAG PARTY
AT THE DUKE.

00:09.130 --> 00:10.880
[JAKE] WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE DUKE?

00:10.920 --> 00:12.930
[MAL] THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH THE DUKE. BUT
WE'RE THERE EVERY NIGHT.

00:12.970 --> 00:18.220
DINNER WOULD BE SOMETHING.
A PLAY AT THE HALL, MAYBE?

00:18.260 --> 00:21.230
[JAKE] OKAY, IT WASN'T A STAG,
IT WAS AN ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

00:21.270 --> 00:23.230
[WALTER] SOME STRIPPERS
WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IS
ALL I'M SAYING.

00:23.270 --> 00:25.190
[JAKE] FOR AN ENGAGEMENT PARTY?
[MAL] YOU SHOULD HAVE
PLANNED MY STAG.

00:25.230 --> 00:28.610
[JAKE] OKAY, FOR THE LAST
TIME, IT WASN'T A STAG,
IT WAS AN ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

00:28.650 --> 00:30.690
[ROSE] IT WAS A LAME STAG.
YOU SHOULDA HAD STRIPPERS.

00:30.740 --> 00:33.200
[JAKE] IT LASTED 'TILL 7
O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING;
IT COULDN'T BE THAT BAD.

00:33.240 --> 00:40.120
[ROSE] COME HERE. HEY THERE,
BABY. ALL RIGHT? OKAY, WALTER.

00:40.160 --> 00:44.120
COME ON, HONEY. OKAY PEOPLE, WE
SERVE BEER, NOT BREAKFAST HERE.

00:44.170 --> 00:45.460
LET'S GO. HEY!

00:45.500 --> 00:47.710
[JAKE] EASY THERE, HEART ATTACK.

00:47.750 --> 00:50.260
YOU'VE GOT A 3 DRINK MAXIMUM FOR
THE WHOLE NIGHT; REMEMBER THAT?

00:50.300 --> 00:53.130
[MAL] WELL, TECHNICALLY, THIS IS
THE NEXT DAY. PLUS, IT THINS OUT

00:53.170 --> 01:00.520
THE BLOOD. LOOK... IT WAS A
LOVELY ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

01:00.560 --> 01:04.690
[JAKE] THANK YOU. SO, ARE YOU
REALLY READY TO TIE THE KNOT

01:04.730 --> 01:08.110
WITH HER, SKIPPER? THE WINDOW'S
CLOSING EVERY DAY. YOU STILL GOT

01:08.150 --> 01:09.770
A CHANCE TO JUMP OUT.

01:09.820 --> 01:12.490
[MAL] JUST BECAUSE YOU FAILED
AT IT, DOESN'T MEAN IT'LL BE
TERRIBLE FOR EVERYONE.

01:12.530 --> 01:15.490
[JAKE] NO, NO. JUST HALF
OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION
AGREES WITH ME.

01:15.530 --> 01:19.240
[MAL] SO BITTER. SO YOUNG.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.660
I ALWAYS THOUGHT LESLIE WOULD
BE PERFECT FOR YOU.

01:21.700 --> 01:25.290
YOU SHOULD MARRY HER. SHE'S
SWEET, SHE HAS A GENTLENESS...

01:25.330 --> 01:26.290
&lt;POLICE SIREN WAILING&gt;

01:29.130 --> 01:31.590
[MAL] SHE'S GOT A GUN.
[LESLIE] JAKE DOYLE,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!

01:31.630 --> 01:33.340
[JAKE] WHAT ARE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT?

01:33.380 --> 01:34.260
[MAL] LESLIE, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

01:34.300 --> 01:36.340
[HOOD] DON'T MOVE AND SHUT UP.

01:36.380 --> 01:39.300
[JAKE] FOR DRINKING IN PUBLIC
OR SOMETHING? YOU COULD HAVE
JUST GIVEN ME A TICKET.

01:39.350 --> 01:40.890
HEY, JUST TAKE IT EASY,
ALL RIGHT?

01:40.930 --> 01:42.680
[HOOD] THAT'S RESISTING ARREST!

01:42.720 --> 01:44.680
&lt;GASPING&gt;

01:44.730 --> 01:46.480
[JAKE] NOW YOU'RE JUST
BEING RUDE.

01:46.520 --> 01:49.060
[LESLIE] HOOD, GO DOWN
THERE AND KEEP EVERYONE
BACK. I'LL HANDLE THIS.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.690
[HOOD] ROLL 'EM BACK! COME ON!

01:50.730 --> 01:53.110
[JAKE] YOU KNOW, IF YOU WERE
TRYING TO ASK ME OUT ON A DATE,

01:53.150 --> 01:54.490
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BRING
THE BALD EAGLE.

01:54.530 --> 01:57.160
[LESLIE] JAKE, PLEASE.
WE NEED YOU TO PLAY ALONG.
I NEED YOUR HELP.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.700
[JAKE] OKAY, YOU HAVE MY HELP.

01:58.740 --> 02:01.490
BUT... YOU GOTTA MAKE OUT
WITH ME, FIRST. NO?

02:01.530 --> 02:03.330
I'M SURE HIS WORSHIP WON'T MIND.

02:03.370 --> 02:05.290
[LESLIE] I BEG YOUR PARDON?

02:05.330 --> 02:08.080
[JAKE] HIS WORSHIP. WHAT
IS IT, A STATE SECRET
THAT YOU'RE DATING THE MAYOR?

02:08.120 --> 02:11.040
[LESLIE] JUST... WOULD YOU CLE--
CLEAN YOURSELF UP ALL RIGHT? AND

02:11.090 --> 02:14.380
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

02:14.420 --> 02:17.340
[HOOD] SO, IS HE IN?

02:17.380 --> 02:23.140
[JAKE] FINE. WHATEVER.
YOU HAVE MY HELP. AND
YOU... YOU HAVE MY PITY.

02:25.640 --> 02:26.600
[LESLIE] MALACHY, STAY BACK.

02:26.640 --> 02:28.650
WE'RE TAKING YOUR SON
TO THE STATION.

02:28.690 --> 02:29.600
[MAL] ON WHAT CHARGE?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.270
[JAKE] ASSAULT ON AN OFFICER.

02:31.310 --> 02:34.320
&lt;CHEERING&gt;

02:41.570 --> 02:44.580
&lt;♪&gt;

02:46.250 --> 02:49.290
♪OH, YEAH♪
♪OH, YEAH♪

02:49.330 --> 02:52.420

03:07.430 --> 03:11.310
[JAKE] HOOD, YOU GOT A LITTLE
UH, ON YOUR...

03:11.350 --> 03:12.650
[ALLISON] THANK YOU FOR COMING.

03:12.690 --> 03:14.940
[JAKE] HI.

03:14.980 --> 03:16.030
[ALLISON] WHAT'S THIS?

03:16.070 --> 03:18.400
[JAKE] HE SLIPPED
WHEN HE WAS ARRESTING ME.

03:18.440 --> 03:20.740
HE'S A LITTLE OLDER
THAN HE THINKS.

03:20.780 --> 03:21.820
[HOOD] THAT'S RIGHT, I SLIPPED.

03:21.860 --> 03:22.950
[JAKE] SEE, I COULDN'T HEAR YOU.

03:22.990 --> 03:25.990
YOUR-YOUR-YOUR VOICE,
IT'S ALL NASAL-Y.

03:27.910 --> 03:28.620
[MAL] WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

03:28.660 --> 03:29.790
[ALLISON] WE NEED YOUR HELP.

03:29.830 --> 03:31.080
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.130
[LESLIE] TOMMY AND BILLY HAYNES.

03:33.170 --> 03:36.800
3 MONTHS AGO, THEY ROBBED
AN ARMOURED CAR CARRYING
A PRICELESS DIAMOND NECKLACE.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.210
IT WAS ON ITS WAY TO THE ROOMS.

03:38.260 --> 03:39.920
[JAKE] A MUSEUM, WHY?

03:39.970 --> 03:43.010
[ALLISON] IT'S FROM THE 1800'S;
IT WAS OWNED BY
EMPRESS ALEXANDRA.

03:43.050 --> 03:45.310
IT'S A PRICELESS RUSSIAN
ARTEFACT AND WE NEED IT BACK.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.020
[LESLIE] THE 2 THIEVES
WERE CAUGHT.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.440
[JAKE] GOOD. SO UH, THE SYSTEM
WORKS. I FEEL BETTER.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

03:50.480 --> 03:52.230
[LESLIE] NEITHER OF THEM WOULD
TELL US WHERE THE DIAMONDS ARE.

03:52.270 --> 03:58.230
AND NOW... TOMMY'S DEAD.
HE DIED IN THE PRISON SHOWER,
LAST NIGHT. HEART ATTACK.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.360
WE THINK SOMEONE WAS BEATING
THE INFORMATION OUT OF HIM.

04:00.400 --> 04:03.200
[MAL] SO, NOW THERE'S
ONLY ONE BROTHER LEFT
WHO CAN TELL ANYONE ANYTHING.

04:03.240 --> 04:05.030
[ALLISON] WE BELIEVE THAT
THERE'S A THIRD MAN INVOLVED.

04:05.070 --> 04:07.370
NEITHER OF THE HAYNES HAD THE
BRAINS TO PULL THIS OFF.

04:07.410 --> 04:09.660
THEY HAD HELP. WE JUST DON'T
KNOW WHO THE MASTERMIND IS.

04:09.700 --> 04:11.330
[MAL] WHAT'S THIS HAVE TO DO
WITH JAKE?

04:11.370 --> 04:13.040
[JAKE] YEAH, WHAT HE SAID.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.830
[LESLIE] WE WANTED
SOMEONE WHO WOULD BE
BELIEVABLE AS AN INMATE,

04:14.880 --> 04:16.840
TO FERRET OUT WHERE
THE DIAMONDS ARE.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.670
[JAKE] HA! I'LL TRY NOT TO
TAKE OFFENCE TO THAT.

04:18.710 --> 04:20.840
YOU WANT ME TO GO TO
JAIL, UNDERCOVER.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.510
[LESLIE] NO, WE WANT YOU TO
GO IN AS JAKE DOYLE.

04:23.550 --> 04:24.840
YOU'VE BEEN INCARCERATED BEFORE.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.470
[ALLISON] WE HAVE
YOUR JUVI FILE, ALSO.

04:27.510 --> 04:31.430
AGE 15, DESTRUCTION
OF SCHOOL PROPERTY.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.060
AGE 14, ASSAULT ON 4 BOYS.

04:34.100 --> 04:37.150
YOU STOLE A DUMP TRUCK
WHEN YOU WERE 12?

04:37.190 --> 04:39.400
[JAKE] I WAS THE PRODUCT OF
AN UNSTABLE HOME LIFE.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.110
I HAD A TERRIBLE FATHER.

04:41.150 --> 04:43.320
[ALLISON] AND ALL
THIS WAS BEFORE YOU JOINED
THE POLICE FORCE,

04:43.360 --> 04:45.200
WHERE YOU GRADUATED
TOP 3 IN YOUR CLASS

04:45.240 --> 04:46.820
AND THEN QUIT AFTER JUST
9 MONTHS OF SERVICE.

04:46.870 --> 04:49.450
[JAKE] I KEPT GETTING DRUNK
AND ARRESTING MYSELF, SO...

04:49.490 --> 04:51.620
[ALLISON] THE PROVINCE IS
REALLY ON THE HOOK FOR THIS.

04:51.660 --> 04:53.870
WE NEED THESE DIAMONDS BACK.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.500
[JAKE] SO, WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?

04:55.540 --> 04:57.500
[LESLIE] A $10,000 FINDER'S FEE.

04:57.540 --> 05:00.130
[JAKE] SOLD TO THE... BLONDE.
LOCK ME UP.

05:00.170 --> 05:02.260
[MAL] NO, NO, NO. HOLD ON
A SECOND. WILL HE BE SAFE?

05:02.300 --> 05:04.300
[LESLIE] WE'LL BE
MONITORING HIM BUT...

05:04.340 --> 05:09.390
[ALLISON] I HAVE A FEELING
HE CAN HANDLE IT. SARGENT.

05:09.430 --> 05:11.350
[JAKE] WE'LL SEE WHAT WE CAN DO!

05:11.390 --> 05:13.480
[LESLIE] WATCH YOURSELF IN
THERE, JAKE. YOU'RE GOING TO BE

05:13.520 --> 05:16.150
COMPLETELY ON YOUR OWN AND
TREATED LIKE ANY OTHER PRISONER.

05:16.190 --> 05:19.480
POSSIBLY EVERY GUARD AND CON IS
AFTER THE HAYNES FORTUNE.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.320
EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW
WHERE THOSE DIAMONDS ARE

05:22.360 --> 05:24.820
AND BEING IN THE OTHER BROTHER'S
CELL, THEY'LL BE AFTER YOU, TOO.

05:24.860 --> 05:26.780
[JAKE] AH!

05:27.870 --> 05:30.870
&lt;♪&gt;
&lt;CAT CALLS AND WHISTLING&gt;

05:54.810 --> 05:57.810
&lt;♪&gt;

06:11.620 --> 06:13.950
[GUSHUE] NOW, YOU FOLLOW THE
RULES... YOU'LL GET NO TROUBLE.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.460
BREAK THE RULES,
I'VE GOT TO BREAK YOU.

06:16.500 --> 06:19.500
[JAKE] OH, NO WORRIES,
I'M ALL ABOUT THE RULES.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.010
[GUSHUE] WELCOME TO THE DIRT.

06:28.470 --> 06:33.100
BILLY? BILLY!
I GOT YOUR NEW ROOMMATE.

06:33.140 --> 06:35.140
JUST IN CASE
YOU MISS YOUR BROTHER.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.440
&lt;CHUCKLING&gt;

06:41.270 --> 06:44.320
[CHANTEL] THE CLONES
ARE COOKING, TINNY.
THEY'RE DOING WAY BETTER.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.530
YOU GOTTA COME SEE THEM.
YOU'RE A TOTAL NATURAL.

06:46.570 --> 06:47.860
[TINNY] I DON'T KNOW, CHANTEL.

06:47.900 --> 06:50.530
I'VE BEEN THINKING. AND THIS
WHOLE CHEECH AND CHONG BUSINESS,

06:50.570 --> 06:52.280
IT'S NOT REALLY MY SCENE,
YOU KNOW?

06:52.330 --> 06:54.490
[CHANTEL] WHAT? NO. TINNY,
YOU CAN'T BACK OUT.

06:54.540 --> 06:56.870
[TINNY] HEY, "BACK OUT"?
I WAS NEVER IN.

06:56.910 --> 06:59.000
[CHANTEL] OKAY, WELL, HOW ELSE
ARE YOU GOING TO GET TO LONDON?

06:59.040 --> 07:02.630
THAT STUPID SCHOOL THING
COSTS A FORTUNE.

07:02.670 --> 07:06.300
[TINNY] OH! WHAT'S WITH
CREEP-TASTIC OVER THERE?

07:06.340 --> 07:07.590
[CHANTEL] HE'S NOTHING.

07:07.630 --> 07:09.260
[DYLAN] CHANTEL, WAIT!

07:10.680 --> 07:13.890
UH, WE SHOULD TALK BUSINESS,
DON'T YOU THINK?
I'LL GIVE YOU A RIDE HOME.

07:13.930 --> 07:16.100
[CHANTEL] DYLA-- I-- I-I WAS
GONNA GO HOME WITH T-TINNY.

07:16.140 --> 07:18.520
[DYLAN] HEH. YEAH,
YOU OWE ME MONEY, RIGHT?

07:21.650 --> 07:23.940
[TINNY] I THINK SHE'D RATHER
WALK, PALLY.

07:23.980 --> 07:27.610
[DYLAN] YOU'RE SO SCREWED.

07:27.650 --> 07:29.240
[CHANTEL] THAT WAS NOT
A GOOD IDEA.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.740
[TINNY] WHO IS THAT GUY?
ARE YOU WORKING FOR HIM?

07:30.780 --> 07:32.700
[CHANTEL] IT'S NOTHING.
HE'S NOBODY.

07:32.740 --> 07:38.750
[TINNY] FINE. I'M OUT.
I'LL FIND ANOTHER WAY.
I'LL BORROW THE MONEY.

07:42.670 --> 07:46.050
[JAKE] MY NAME'S JAKE... DOYLE,
BY-BY THE WAY.

07:47.670 --> 07:50.680
SORRY TO HEAR
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER.

07:50.720 --> 07:54.050
I HAVE A BROTHER, TOO--
I MEAN, HE'S NOT DEAD.
SOMETIMES I WISH HE WAS.

07:54.100 --> 07:55.760
YOU KNOW?
SO I CAN KIND OF RELATE.

07:55.810 --> 07:58.810
[BILLY] I DON'T CARE ANYTHING
ABOUT YOU... OR YOUR BROTHER.

07:58.850 --> 08:02.690
TRYING TO GET ME TO TALK? FORGET
IT. BIGGER THAN YOU HAVE TRIED.

08:02.730 --> 08:05.690
SO, WHY DON'T YOU JUST KEEP YOUR
MOUTH SHUT; WE'LL BOTH BE HAPPY.

08:05.730 --> 08:11.110
[JAKE] NOT IN THE CHIT-CHAT
MOOD. NO. PAS DE PROBLEM!

08:12.820 --> 08:16.700
[MAURICE] DIAMONDS ON YOUR MIND,
DOYLE?

08:16.740 --> 08:18.410
[JAKE] MAURICE BECKER.

08:18.450 --> 08:24.710
[MAURICE] IN THE FLESH.
"CRIME DON'T PAY"
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU FELLAS SAID?

08:24.750 --> 08:28.880
WELL, I'D KNOW ABOUT THAT NOW,
WOULDN'T I?

08:28.920 --> 08:35.680
BUT NOW YOU'RE LOCKED IN HERE
WITH ME. FUN-FUNNY, INNIT...

08:35.720 --> 08:40.600

KARMA, IRONY.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.770
[JAKE] JUST GOING OUT ON A LIMB
HERE, BUT UH...

08:43.810 --> 08:46.230
DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH
THAT NECKLACE GOIN' MISSING?

08:46.270 --> 08:49.980
[MAURICE] I'M NOT GOING TO
DIGNIFY THAT! JEWEL THEFT!

08:50.030 --> 08:51.690
WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME FOR, DOYLE?

08:51.740 --> 08:58.370
ROBBERY IS FOR FOOLS
AND DREAMERS. I'M A
PRACTICAL BUSINESSMAN.

08:58.410 --> 09:01.580
HOWEVER...

09:01.620 --> 09:09.670
REVENGE... CAN ALWAYS BE AN
EXCEPTION TO THAT RULE.

09:09.710 --> 09:14.720
AND YOUR FLY IS OPEN.
THAT SHOULD GET YOU PART WAY
IN HERE.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.600
[MAL] ROSE? PICKED UP THOSE
PICTURES FROM THE STAG.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.180
[ROSE] BIRTHDAY PARTY! GREAT.

09:22.220 --> 09:24.810
YOU'RE TERRIFIC, SWEETIE. BEST
NEW LIVE-IN BOYFRIEND EVER.

09:24.850 --> 09:26.190
[MAL] LIVE-IN WHAT?

09:26.230 --> 09:28.860
[BETH] DOES ANYONE WANT A
COCKTAIL?

09:28.900 --> 09:31.110
[ROSE] UM... MY MOTHER'S HERE.

09:31.150 --> 09:34.530
OH, SHE DOES THIS... ONCE A
DECADE, TOTALLY OUT OF THE BLUE.

09:34.570 --> 09:36.110

09:38.120 --> 09:45.120
UH, THIS IS UM... MOM. BETH.

09:45.160 --> 09:46.370
[MAL] NICE TO MEET YA.

[BETH] WELL, AREN'T YOU A
HANDSOME DARLING? GOOD WORK,

09:49.840 --> 09:53.420
ROSE. HE'S GOT AN EDGE, NOT A
STUPID, PRETTY FACE. I BET HE'S

09:53.460 --> 09:55.340
A DEVIL IN THE SACK.

09:55.380 --> 09:56.470
[MAL] WELL, UH...

09:56.510 --> 09:57.680
[ROSE] MOTHER...

09:57.720 --> 09:59.680
[BETH] ROSE TOLD YOU I WAS DEAD,
DIDN'T SHE?

09:59.720 --> 10:01.680
[MAL] NO!

10:01.720 --> 10:03.810
[BETH] OH, DON'T YOU WORRY
ABOUT THAT. MY ROSE HAS GOT
A WILD IMAGINATION.

10:03.850 --> 10:05.560
YOU'VE NOT CHANGED
ONE BIT, ROSIE.

10:05.600 --> 10:06.940
[ROSE] OH, YES MOTHER, I HAVE.

10:06.980 --> 10:09.770
[BETH] THIS IS QUITE THE PLACE
YOU'VE GRABBED HERE.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.770
[ROSE] WELL, IT'S NOT AS NICE AS
IT LOOKS.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.980
[BETH] MALACHY, I BET YOU GOT
THIS PLACE FOR A STEAL BEFORE

DOESN'T SEEM VERY SHOOKEN UP
ABOUT THE FACT THAT HIS

10:58.610 --> 11:00.110
BROTHER'S DEAD.

11:00.150 --> 11:01.320

11:19.430 --> 11:21.510
[MAL] MAURICE BECKER
COULD BE THE THIRD MAN.

11:21.550 --> 11:23.720
MAYBE HE PLANNED IT FROM PRISON.

11:23.760 --> 11:28.020
[JAKE] MAYBE YOU CAN LOOK INTO

&lt;CHUCKLING&gt;

12:13.600 --> 12:15.980

[JAKE] UH, YEAH, WELL... I LIKE

12:57.150 --> 12:59.360
DISCUSSION'S NOT AN OPTION
AROUND HERE WITH THE GUARDS,

12:59.400 --> 13:00.650
HUH? AH!

13:00.690 --> 13:02.610
[DR. PRICE] THEY CURB VIOLENCE
AS SOON AS THEY SEE IT.

13:02.650 --> 13:04.950
[JAKE] WITH MORE VIOLENCE? THAT
GUY WAS LIKE SOME SORT OF

13:04.990 --> 13:06.490
AMATEUR NINJA.

13:06.530 --> 13:08.830
[DR. PRICE] GUSHUE; HE'S THE
MOST EXCITABLE GUARD HERE. YOU

13:08.870 --> 13:11.540
HAVE A MILD CONCUSSION. YOU'LL
BE FINE. THEY'RE PRETTY EXPERT

13:11.580 --> 13:17.590
AT SUBDUING PEOPLE WITHOUT
DAMAGE.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.460
[JAKE] MAY I?

13:28.760 --> 13:30.510
[GUSHUE] YOU GOTTA KEEP
YOUR NOSE OUT OF OTHER
PEOPLE'S BUSINESS.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.560
[JAKE] SORRY, GUSHUE, MY
JUDGEMENT'S A LITTLE OFF I

EXAMINER'S REPORT... SAID BILLY

15:13.530 --> 15:15.830
DIED OF A RUPTURED ANEURISM.

15:15.870 --> 15:17.830
MAYBE THE LAST GUY TO KNOW WHERE
THE DIAMONDS ARE.

15:17.870 --> 15:20.330
[JAKE] BOTH HAYNES BROTHERS DIED
OF NATURAL CAUSES IN 2 DAYS?

15:20.370 --> 15:21.750
THINK ABOUT IT.

15:21.790 --> 15:23.540
[ALLISON] WELL, THAT'S WHAT THE
M.E.'S REPORT TELLS ME.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.260

15:29.470 --> 15:30.760
[LESLIE] WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

15:30.800 --> 15:33.180
[JAKE] MAYBE SOMEONE KILLED
THEM. AND IF THEY DID, THAT

15:33.220 --> 15:35.310
PERSON KNOWS WHERE THE NECKLACE
IS.

15:35.350 --> 15:37.020
[MAL] LOOK, IT'S GETTING WAY TOO
DANGEROUS.

15:37.060 --> 15:39.100
[JAKE] NO, NO! IT'S NOT TOO
DANGEROUS. I'VE ONLY BEEN IN

15:39.140 --> 15:41.770
THERE A DAY, SO, THERE'S NO
POINT IN TAKING ME OUT, NOW.

15:41.810 --> 15:43.650
[ALLISON] YOU'RE AFRAID YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO GET PAID.

15:43.690 --> 15:44.690
UNBELIEVABLE.

15:44.730 --> 15:47.150
[LESLIE] DID YOU
MANAGE TO GET...

15:47.190 --> 15:49.950

[MAL] LOOK... THERE'S NO
EVIDENCE MAURICE BECKER HAS
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

16:17.220 --> 16:18.770
HE'S SIMPLY NOT CONNECTED.

16:18.810 --> 16:20.560
[JAKE] THEN MAURICE BECKER'S NOT
OUR THIRD MAN.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.560

[TINNY] IF I'M GOING TO DO
THIS... I WANT TO KNOW WHAT I'M

16:53.220 --> 16:57.430

[BETH] SO... HOW'S YOUR POKER
FACE?

20:54.420 --> 20:56.500
[DR. PRICE] MR. DOYLE, WHAT IS
IT TODAY?

20:56.540 --> 20:58.670
[JAKE] WELL, TO BE HONEST WITH
YOU, THERE'S NOT A LOT OF GIRLS

20:58.710 --> 21:00.960
IN HERE, SO I JUST NEED SOMEONE
TO FLIRT WITH.

21:01.010 --> 21:02.420
[DR. PRICE] YOU CAME HERE TO
FLIRT WITH ME?

21:02.470 --> 21:04.300
[JAKE] WELL, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY A
LOT MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN MY LAST

21:04.340 --> 21:07.640
ROOMMATE. I GUESS WITH ALL THE
TALK ABOUT ANEURISMS AND HEART

21:07.680 --> 21:10.390
ATTACKS... I'M STARTING TO FEEL
A LITTLE BIT OF A HEADACHE

21:10.430 --> 21:11.970
MYSELF.

21:12.020 --> 21:14.480
[DR. PRICE] YEAH, 2 BROTHERS DIE
IN 2 DAYS... IT'S BEEN A-A ROUGH

21:14.520 --> 21:15.650
WEEK FOR ME AS A DOCTOR.

21:15.690 --> 21:17.770
[JAKE] LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING... IS IT POSSIBLE-- I

21:17.810 --> 21:21.320
MEAN, HYPOTHETICALLY-- YOU'RE A
DOCTOR, RIGHT? COULD SOMEONE, IF

21:21.360 --> 21:24.320
THEY HAD THE PROPER TRAINING,
HIT SOMEONE IN THE HEAD OR THE

21:24.360 --> 21:26.620
CHEST AND HAVE THEM DIE FROM IT
LATER?

21:26.660 --> 21:28.330
[DR. PRICE] YOU MEAN, COULD
SOMEONE HAVE INDUCED THE HEART

21:28.370 --> 21:30.200
ATTACK OR RUPTURED BILLY'S
ANEURISM?

21:30.240 --> 21:31.740
[JAKE] YEAH, I MEAN, YOU KNOW...

21:31.790 --> 21:33.460
HYPOTHETICALLY, IF THEY WERE
LIKE, TRAINED IN MARTIAL ARTS

21:33.500 --> 21:35.170
OR--
[DR. PRICE] WOW, YOU'RE

21:35.210 --> 21:36.880
BEGINNING TO SOUND MORE LIKE A
COP THAN AN INMATE.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.340
[JAKE] WELL... THAT'S BECAUSE
I'M A P.I. YEAH, I MEAN, I WAS A

21:39.380 --> 21:42.210
P.I. BEFORE I WAS A CROOK. I
MEAN, I WAS ALWAYS A CROOK AND A

21:42.260 --> 21:43.800
P.I.

21:43.840 --> 21:45.380
[DR. PRICE] WELL, BOTH BROTHERS
WERE BEATEN BEFORE THEY DIED, SO

21:45.430 --> 21:48.140
YES, YOUR THEORY IS POSSIBLE.

21:48.180 --> 21:51.470
[JAKE] MMM. THE QUESTION IS WHO
WOULD HAVE BEAT HIM, YOU KNOW?

21:51.520 --> 21:52.560
[DR. PRICE] I DON'T KNOW.

21:52.600 --> 21:55.600
[JAKE] I THINK I DO.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.140
[GUSHUE] WE DONE HERE YET, DOC?

21:57.190 --> 22:02.530
[DR. PRICE] ABSOLUTELY, MR.
GUSHUE. YOU'RE FINE. HERE ARE A

22:02.570 --> 22:04.240
FEW LIGHT PAINKILLERS.

22:04.280 --> 22:06.450
[JAKE] I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU GOT A
SHOT OF WHISKY BACK THERE?

22:06.490 --> 22:07.780
[DR. PRICE] SORRY.

22:07.820 --> 22:10.950
[GUSHUE] LET'S GO.

22:10.990 --> 22:12.790
[ROSE] SO, THIS IS GUSHUE THE
GUARD'S HOUSE, HUH?

22:12.830 --> 22:15.460
[MAL] YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN HOW
YOUR MOTHER BECAME UNDEAD?

22:15.500 --> 22:18.540
[ROSE] I-I THINK I EXAGGERATED
ABOUT THAT ONE. YOU WANT TO HAND

22:18.580 --> 22:20.130
ME THOSE WIRE CUTTER THINGIES?

22:20.170 --> 22:24.260
[MAL] SHE'S WHAT? A CON-ARTIST?
[ROSE] NO, NO, NO... SORT OF.

22:24.300 --> 22:26.340
YEAH. YES.

22:26.380 --> 22:28.010
[MAL] WHAT ELSE HAVEN'T YOU TOLD
ME?

22:28.050 --> 22:29.930
[ROSE] I DON'T LIKE YOUR SEAL
FLIPPER PIE. AND IN GENERAL,

22:29.970 --> 22:31.970
YOUR COOKING SUCKS. BUT OTHER
THAN THAT, THAT IS IT. I SWEAR

22:32.010 --> 22:32.890
ON MY MOTHER'S GRAVE.

22:32.930 --> 22:34.850
[MAL] SNIP THAT BEFORE IT GOES
OFF.

22:34.890 --> 22:38.400
[ROSE] YES, SIR. YOU KNOW, I DID
IT FOR YOUR OWN GOOD, MALACHY.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.190
NOW THAT SHE KNOWS ABOUT YOU,
SHE'S GOING TO THINK YOU'RE

22:40.230 --> 22:41.110
ANOTHER MARK.

22:41.150 --> 22:42.690
[MAL] SO AM I... A MARK?

22:42.730 --> 22:45.900
[ROSE] WELL, IF I WAS RUNNING A
GAME, I'D SHOOT HIGHER THAN YOU.

22:45.940 --> 22:47.990
OH, YEAH, THERE IS ONE OTHER
THING. I THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE

22:48.030 --> 22:54.080
SORT OF STOLEN MY ENGAGEMENT
RING. WELCOME TO MY FAMILY.

22:54.120 --> 22:55.540
[MAL] WHAT?

22:55.580 --> 23:00.670
[ROSE] OH... MY. SOMEONE HAS
BEEN DOING THEIR HOMEWORK.

23:00.710 --> 23:02.540
[MAL] GUSHUE'S ON THE TRAIL.

23:02.590 --> 23:07.130
LOOKS LIKE HE HAS BEEN FOR A
WHILE. LOOK... THERE'S TOMMY...

23:07.170 --> 23:08.510
BILLY...

23:08.550 --> 23:13.220
[ROSE] LOOK AT THIS. HERE'S THE
NECKLACE. IT'S GORGEOUS. WHO IS

23:13.260 --> 23:15.100
CLAIRE MURRAY?

23:15.140 --> 23:19.810
[MAL] HOW NOW... ANOTHER
MYSTERY. MAYBE OUR THIRD MAN IS

23:19.850 --> 23:22.020
A THIRD WOMAN.

23:22.060 --> 23:24.610
[ROSE] WELL, IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE HE'S FOUND HER YET.

23:24.650 --> 23:27.780
[MAL] SHE STOLE YOUR ENGAGEMENT
RING?

23:27.820 --> 23:35.120
[FOLEY] BUDDY! BUDDY, BUDDY.

23:35.160 --> 23:38.580
[MAURICE] NOW DOYLE... YOU HAVE
ISSUES WITH AUTHORITY. I GET

23:38.620 --> 23:42.460
THAT, I DO. YOU DON'T LIKE TO
FOLLOW THE RULES, ETCETERA.

23:42.500 --> 23:45.090
WELL, THAT'S ADMIRABLE IN A
REGULAR SOCIETY.

23:45.130 --> 23:48.340
[JAKE] OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
THIS IN-DEPTH PSYCHOANALYSIS.

23:48.380 --> 23:54.100
BUT JUST TELL ME ONE THING. WERE
YOU IN ON THE HEIST OR NOT?

23:54.140 --> 23:59.430
[MAURICE] YOU KNOW, PRISON
HAS A DIFFERENT CULTURE THAN
WHAT WE SEE IN THE MOVIES.

23:59.480 --> 24:06.150
IN HERE, THERE IS YOU
AND THEN... THERE IS ME.

24:06.190 --> 24:08.280
[JAKE] YOU DON'T LIKE ME IN
HERE, ROOTIN' AROUND, DO YA?

24:08.320 --> 24:14.160
[MAURICE] AU CONTRAIRE. I LIKE
TO SEE A MAN DIG HIS OWN GRAVE.

24:14.200 --> 24:21.210
MR. WOLF, DID YOU KNOW THAT HE
WAS A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR?

24:26.340 --> 24:29.670
[JAKE] WHOA... NOW FELLAS. NOW I
WAS A PRI-- I'M A CROOK.

24:29.710 --> 24:31.880
[MAURICE] ENJOY YOURSELF.

24:31.930 --> 24:34.930
[JAKE] I'M NOT NOW.
I MEAN-- I MEAN, I'M IN HERE.
WE'RE A TEAM--

24:36.720 --> 24:38.680
&lt;CHEERING&gt;

24:38.720 --> 24:40.100
[GUSHUE] PADDY, GET IN THERE.

24:40.730 --> 24:43.730
&lt;SHOUTING&gt;

25:15.140 --> 25:19.100
[MAURICE] THAT THERE IS WHAT
YOU CALL A SELF-CLEANING OVEN.

25:19.140 --> 25:23.560
TURN ON THE HEAT...
AND IT TAKES CARE OF ITSELF.

25:23.600 --> 25:26.610
&lt;SHOUTING&gt;

25:34.610 --> 25:40.290
[GUSHUE] ALL RIGHT. YOU TWO,
BEHAVE.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.200
[WOLF] WHAT A DOUCHE.

25:42.250 --> 25:46.670
[JAKE] SO UH, LISTEN. I'M SORRY
ABOUT BEFORE. OKAY? THERE'S BEEN

25:46.710 --> 25:49.710
ENOUGH CRAP BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

25:49.750 --> 25:53.880
HERE. I KNOW YOU GOT A JOB TO
DO. I GET IT.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.590
[WOLF] YOU DON'T WANT NOTHING
FOR 'EM, LIKE, YOU WANT PULL

25:56.630 --> 25:57.930
SOMEONE'S EYES OUT OR SOMETHING?

25:57.970 --> 25:59.680
[JAKE] NO, NO. NO, I'M GOOD.

25:59.720 --> 26:02.350
IT'S JUST A SIMPLE PEACE
OFFERING.

26:02.390 --> 26:05.730
[GUSHUE] HUH. I WAS IN THE MOOD
FOR A BREAK. DON'T DO ANYTHING

26:05.770 --> 26:08.360
STUPID.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.940
[JAKE] WHAT A DOUCHE.

26:09.980 --> 26:12.190
[WOLF] TOTAL DOUCHE. EVEN THE
OTHER GUARDS CAN'T STAND HIM.

26:12.230 --> 26:15.450
[JAKE] LISTEN... HERE, I'VE GOT
ANOTHER PACK. PUT THEM IN YOUR

26:15.490 --> 26:21.280
POCKET BEFORE HE COMES BACK.

26:21.330 --> 26:23.700
[WOLF] I HOPE BECKER DOESN'T GET
ME TO POUND YOU AGAIN. YOU'RE

26:23.750 --> 26:26.000
ALL RIGHT, DOYLE. NOT HALF AS
BIG A TOOL AS I THOUGHT YOU'D

26:26.040 --> 26:27.830
BE.

26:27.870 --> 26:30.710
[JAKE] I'M JUST LIKE ANYONE ELSE
IN HERE. AN HONEST MAN WHO GOT

26:30.750 --> 26:31.750
CAUGHT.

26:31.800 --> 26:33.710
[WOLF] YEAH? WHAT'D YOU DO?

26:33.760 --> 26:40.600
[JAKE] I ASSAULTED A POLICE
OFFICER. YOU?

26:40.640 --> 26:47.810
[WOLF] I KILLED MY FATHER. NO,
B'Y. ONLY JOKING. B &amp; E'S. A FEW

26:47.850 --> 26:50.520
ROBBERIES, THAT'S ALL.

26:50.560 --> 26:53.150
[JAKE] ROBBERIES? REALLY?

26:53.190 --> 26:54.780
[DR. PRICE] DANGEROUS, THEY'LL
HURT YOU.

26:54.820 --> 26:56.700
[FOLEY] STAY OUT OF THIS. MIND
YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

26:56.740 --> 26:59.360
[JAKE] HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT IN
THERE?

26:59.410 --> 27:03.700
[DR. PRICE] UH, HE TRIED TO GRAB
SOME PAINKILLERS. IT'S NOTHING.

27:03.740 --> 27:06.790
[JAKE] SHOULDN'T YOU LIKE,
YOU KNOW, RELEASE THE HOUNDS
OR WHATEVER?

27:06.830 --> 27:08.870
[DR. PRICE] IT'S FINE. HE'S GOT
NOWHERE TO GO BUT HIS CELL.

27:08.920 --> 27:11.840
AND GUSHUE WILL BE TOO
HARD ON HIM; HE'LL HURT HIM.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.670
FOLEY, HE-HE HAS A SERIOUS DRUG
PROBLEM. I'VE BEEN
TREATING HIM FOR A WHILE

27:14.710 --> 27:20.930
AND... HE-HE'LL BE FINE.

27:20.970 --> 27:23.680
[WOLF] RIGHT ON.

27:23.720 --> 27:25.260
[CHANTEL] HOW'S IT GOING?

27:25.310 --> 27:27.350
[TINNY] I THINK WE FINALLY GOT
THE PH RIGHT. BUT WE CAN'T CHEAP

27:27.390 --> 27:28.690
OUT ON THE LIGHTS.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.730
[CHANTEL] YEAH, YOU SHOULD SEE
THE ELECTRIC BILL.

27:30.770 --> 27:33.400
[TINNY] YOU HAVEN'T TAPPED
INTO THE HYDRO LINE?

27:33.440 --> 27:36.690
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A JUVI
ROOMIE WHO LIKES TO TOUCH
YOUR HAIR AND SNUGGLE?

27:36.730 --> 27:39.860
THE KEY HERE IS TO
NOT GET CAUGHT.

27:39.900 --> 27:41.990
&lt;BANGING&gt;
[CHANTEL] UH-OH. DYLAN.

27:42.030 --> 27:46.830
[TINNY] OH, I THOUGHT HE
WAS NO PROBLEM. CHANTEL,
WHAT IS HE AFTER?

27:46.870 --> 27:49.250
[CHANTEL] I BOUGHT THE EQUIPMENT
FROM HIM. I WAS SUPPOSED TO PAY

27:49.290 --> 27:52.250
HIM BACK WITH MY FIRST CROP,
WHICH YOU KNOW, IT DIED.

27:52.290 --> 27:54.250
&lt;BANGING&gt;

27:54.290 --> 27:57.670
[CHANTEL] HE'S GOING TO TAKE THE

28:04.600 --> 28:08.100
[DES] AH! AH! AH, TINNY, WHAT

28:08.140 --> 28:09.310

28:18.070 --> 28:20.200
WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

28:20.240 --> 28:24.450
[CHANTEL] YOU COULD HELP US TAP
INTO THE POWER LINE. WHAT'S YOUR

28:24.490 --> 28:25.950
NAME?

28:25.990 --> 28:28.580
[DES] TINNY... YOU CAN'T BE
DOING THIS. OKAY? THIS IS

28:28.620 --> 28:31.870
DANGEROUS. AND IT INVOLVES
DANGEROUS PEOPLE AND POLICE AND

28:31.920 --> 28:34.750
A NOMADIC LIFE THAT LEADS TO
SECLUSION... AND EATING COLD

28:34.790 --> 28:36.290
BEANS OVER A SINK AT LIKE, 3 AM.

28:36.340 --> 28:38.920
[TINNY] WHEN DID THIS BECOME
SOME KIND OF DEBATE?

28:38.960 --> 28:43.180
HELP ME OR GET OUT.
WHERE'S THE POWER POLE?

28:43.220 --> 28:45.220

[ROSE] WELL, WE DON'T KNOW YET,

29:01.900 --> 29:03.950
[MAL] HE'S CHECKED OUT EVERY
CLAIRE MURRAY IN THE ISLAND,

29:03.990 --> 29:05.990
BUT SEEMS TO HAVE
ELIMINATED THEM ALL.

29:06.030 --> 29:08.160
[JAKE] MAYBE OUR THIRD MAN'S A
THIRD WOMAN.

29:08.200 --> 29:10.620
[ROSE] YEAH, LIKE A SISTER OR
A GIRLFRIEND.

29:10.660 --> 29:13.210
[MAL] OR A MOTHER.

29:13.250 --> 29:16.750
[JAKE] YEAH. BY THE WAY,
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT
GUSHUE'S INVOLVED.

29:16.790 --> 29:18.550
LET ME SEE WHAT I CAN
FIND OUT ON MY END.

29:18.590 --> 29:23.720
[GUSHUE] DOYLE! THINK IT'S TIME

29:40.110 --> 29:42.820

WAS AFRAID OF THAT. NOW, THE

29:42.860 --> 29:46.030
BEST LIARS ARE THE ONES THAT
BELIEVE THE LIES THEMSELVES.

29:46.070 --> 29:49.780
[ROSE] I'M HAPPY, MOTHER. FOR
THE FIRST TIME.

29:49.830 --> 29:53.370

THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD
HAPPEN TO A CHILD OF MINE.

29:53.410 --> 30:01.420
FOOLS FALL IN LOVE, ROSIE.
ANYWAY... I WISH YOU LUCK.

30:04.420 --> 30:05.800

30:06.130 --> 30:11.810
[ROSE] THANK YOU. THANKS A LOT.

30:11.850 --> 30:13.390
[JAKE] TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
IWAS KIND OF HOPING

30:13.430 --> 30:15.020
WE COULD GET TO KNOW EACH
OTHER A LITTLE BETTER.

30:15.060 --> 30:17.190
[GUSHUE] NAH, WE'LL JUST STOP
BY THE SHOWER.

30:17.230 --> 30:18.810
[JAKE] WELL, LISTEN MAN,
I'M HITTING ON YOU.

30:18.860 --> 30:21.860
I WAS KIND OF HOPING WE COULD
AVOID ALL THAT WHILE I'M HERE.

30:23.530 --> 30:25.320
[FOLEY] I'M SORRY, JAKE.
I GOTTA DO THIS.

30:25.360 --> 30:26.570

31:00.770 --> 31:06.070
[LESLIE] IT'S OVER.
IT'S OUR FAULT FOR PUTTING
YOU IN HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

31:06.110 --> 31:07.950

CLEAR OUT YOUR CELL.

31:07.990 --> 31:12.990
I'LL GET YOU RELEASED. I'LL MEET

[WOLF] THE BOYS ARE CALLING
YOU "ONE SMACK DOYLE".

31:25.130 --> 31:29.630
IT'S BETTER THAN...
"DICK SMACK DOYLE" I SUPPOSE.

31:29.680 --> 31:32.680
[JAKE] WELL,
THAT IS TRUE. THANKS.

31:34.140 --> 31:36.890

32:25.360 --> 32:29.400
[JAKE] AYE. TOMMY HAYNES.
CAUSE OF DEATH: HEART ATTACK.

32:29.440 --> 32:35.950
BILLY HAYNES. CAUSE OF DEATH:
ANEURISM. JIM FOLEY.
CAUSE OF DEATH: STROKE.

32:35.990 --> 32:39.370
SHE HAS AN AUTOPSY REPORT FOR
A MAN WHO LITERALLY JUST DIED.

32:40.580 --> 32:44.960
DR. PRICE; SHE FAKED THESE
AUTOPSY REPORTS AND NOW SHE'S
GOING TO TORCH THE EVIDENCE.

32:45.000 --> 32:49.010
CAN YOU UM, DRIVE ME,
ACTUALLY? PLEASE?

32:50.300 --> 32:53.300
&lt;POLICE SIREN WAILING&gt;

32:54.220 --> 32:59.970
[LESLIE] ATTENTION ALL UNITS...
ISSUING AN A.P.B. ON
ONE DR. ANNIE PRICE.

33:00.020 --> 33:03.020
&lt;POLICE SIREN WAILING&gt;

33:14.610 --> 33:16.620
[LESLIE] STOP RIGHT THERE!

33:25.080 --> 33:29.750
WHERE'S THE PAPERWORK? THIS IS
SUPPOSED TO BE JIMMY FOLEY.

33:29.800 --> 33:33.970
IT'S A CREMATION ORDERED BY DR.
ANNIE PRICE. WHERE'S THE BODY?

33:34.010 --> 33:36.010
[JAKE] WITH THE OTHER TWO.

33:41.430 --> 33:43.020
[ALLISON] I HOPE
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THIS, DOYLE.

33:43.060 --> 33:47.190
ARRESTING A DOCTOR UNDER
SUSPICION OF MURDER IS NO JOKE.

33:47.230 --> 33:52.240
[JAKE] YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY
ARE VERY, VERY ATTRACTIVE.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.860
OH! SHE DIDN'T KILL ANYONE.

33:54.900 --> 33:56.990
[ALLISON] WELL, THEN WHY DID WE
BRING HER IN?

33:57.030 --> 34:01.700
[JAKE] BECAUSE SHE KNOWS WHERE
THE DIAMONDS ARE.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.870
[HOOD] SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE
THAT NECKLACE IS. IF SHE DID,

34:03.910 --> 34:05.580
SHE DID, SHE'D JUST GO
GET IT HERSELF.

34:05.620 --> 34:08.040
[ALLISON] SERGEANT BENNETT,
3 MEN DIED ON YOUR WATCH.

34:08.080 --> 34:11.250
YOU LOSE THE BODIES,
NOT TO MENTION THE NECKLACE.

34:11.300 --> 34:14.050
DID WE ARREST A
DOCTOR FOR NOTHING?

34:15.300 --> 34:17.680
[LESLIE] JAKE, YOU'RE GOING TO
BE THE DEATH OF ME.

34:23.390 --> 34:24.770
[MAL] JAKE.

34:24.810 --> 34:26.350
[JAKE] HEY, DID YOU GET 'EM?

34:26.390 --> 34:29.400
[MAL] I DID 3 CONVENIENCE STORES
AND AN A.T.M. BUT I STRUCK GOLD.

34:29.440 --> 34:30.650
[JAKE] GOOD MAN.

34:30.690 --> 34:31.900
[MAL] HURRY UP.

34:31.940 --> 34:32.820
[JAKE] HOW DO I LOOK?

34:32.860 --> 34:35.030
[MAL] AWFUL. MOVE IT.

34:35.070 --> 34:39.990
[JAKE] HI. DR. PRICE. JAKE
DOYLE. REMEMBER ME?

34:40.030 --> 34:41.410
[DR. PRICE] WAIT, YOU'RE A COP?

34:41.450 --> 34:42.830
[JAKE] YEAH! SURE.

34:42.870 --> 34:43.540
[DR. PRICE] I KNEW IT!

34:43.580 --> 34:45.040
[JAKE] HERE ARE YOUR...

34:45.080 --> 34:49.170
AUTOPSY REPORTS. NICE WORK,
PERFORMING AN AUTOPSY ON A MAN

34:49.210 --> 34:51.340
THAT'S STILL ALIVE. SUPER.

34:51.380 --> 34:57.260
EXCELLENT, REALLY. THIS PHOTO
WAS TAKEN... FROM AN A.T.M.

34:57.300 --> 35:00.050
THAT'S JIM FOLEY AS YOU KNOW,
TODAY'S DATE. THE TIME WAS AN

35:00.090 --> 35:05.350
HOUR AGO. HERE'S ANOTHER... DEAD
MAN WALKING. OR, RUNNING,

35:05.390 --> 35:09.020
REALLY. I DON'T HAVE A PHOTO OF
BILLY HAYNES; HE MUST HAVE RAN

35:09.060 --> 35:13.690
DOWN BARTER'S HILL. WHERE ARE
THEY AND WHERE'S THE NECKLACE?

35:13.730 --> 35:17.280
[ALLISON] WE'RE LETTING THE GOOD
DOCTOR GO. WHAT'S HE DOING? GET

35:17.320 --> 35:20.280
HIM OUT OF THERE?

35:20.320 --> 35:22.070
[LESLIE] I SUPPOSE YOU COULD
HAVE STOPPED HIM.

35:22.120 --> 35:25.870
[MAL] I FIND IT'S BEST TO LET
HIM TIRE HIMSELF OUT.

35:25.910 --> 35:28.080
[JAKE] THEY'RE REALLY MAD AT YOU
OUT THERE. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN

35:28.120 --> 35:29.460
HOLD THEM OFF FOR LONG.

35:29.500 --> 35:32.210
[DR. PRICE] WHERE DID YOU GET
THOSE?

35:32.250 --> 35:35.250
[JAKE] WHERE DO YOU THINK? I HAD
THEM ANALYSED.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.380
[LESLIE] DID HE?

35:36.420 --> 35:39.340
[MAL] UNLESS HE DID IT HIMSELF,
I'D SAY NO.

35:39.380 --> 35:41.430
[DR. PRICE] OKAY, YOU'VE GOT TO
HELP ME.

35:41.470 --> 35:43.010
[JAKE] I WANT TO HELP YA, ANNIE.

35:43.050 --> 35:46.560
I DO. BUT YOU HELPED FAKE THEIR
DEATHS, YOU FORGED THE AUTOPSY

35:46.600 --> 35:48.350
REPORTS. I HAD THESE TESTED.

35:48.390 --> 35:51.520
THEY ALL TESTED POSITIVE FOR
T.T.X. YOU KNOW, THE PATIENT

35:51.560 --> 35:52.690
ZOMBIE DRUG.

35:52.730 --> 35:54.860
[DR. PRICE] BUT-- NO, I USED
PROPOFOL.

35:54.900 --> 35:57.240
&lt;GASPING&gt;
[JAKE] I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT

35:57.280 --> 35:59.650
WORKED. I MEAN, HONESTLY, TRULY,
BETWEEN YOU AND ME, I HAD NO

35:59.700 --> 36:01.240
IDEA WHAT WAS IN THESE THINGS.

36:01.280 --> 36:04.490
THEY'RE NOT EVEN REAL. WHY DID
YOU DO IT, ANNIE? NOT FOR THE

36:04.530 --> 36:06.830
DIAMONDS.

36:06.870 --> 36:09.250
[DR. PRICE] HE'S A GOOD MAN--
HE-HE... HE'S NOT LIKE THE OTHER

36:09.290 --> 36:11.330
TWO.

36:11.370 --> 36:13.290
[JAKE] YOU AND FOLEY, YOU'RE IN
LOVE.

36:13.330 --> 36:14.670
[DR. PRICE] THEY THREATENED ME.

36:14.710 --> 36:17.260
"GET US ALL OUT, OR-OR WE'LL
KILL FOLEY."

36:17.300 --> 36:19.840
[JAKE] SO, NOBODY KNOWS
THAT FOLEY WAS IN
ON THIS DIAMOND JOB?

36:19.880 --> 36:21.380
[DR. PRICE] HE COULDN'T
TELL THE HAYNES BROTHERS

36:21.430 --> 36:23.760
WHERE THE DIAMONDS WERE
IF HE WANTED TO STAY ALIVE.

36:23.800 --> 36:27.220
AND-AND NOW, AS SOON AS
THEY GET THEIR HANDS ON THEM...

36:27.260 --> 36:29.140
[JAKE] OKAY, LOOK... ANNIE,

36:29.180 --> 36:32.100
YOU GOTTA TELL ME,
WHO'S CLAIRE MURRAY AND
WHERE ARE THE DIAMONDS?

36:32.140 --> 36:34.730
ANNIE! I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT CAN HELP YOU.

36:34.770 --> 36:37.780
&lt;BANGING&gt;

36:44.450 --> 36:45.780
[JAKE] THANK YOU.

36:45.830 --> 36:46.950

36:46.990 --> 36:50.410

36:55.460 --> 36:58.210
&lt;♪&gt;

37:03.380 --> 37:05.390
[BILLY] YOU AREN'T DICKING US
AROUND, RIGHT, FOLEY?

37:05.430 --> 37:07.010
[TOMMY] NO, HE'S SMARTER
THAN THAT.

37:07.050 --> 37:09.390
[FOLEY] I'M TELLING YOU,
SHE'S DOWN THERE.
I'LL GO DOWN AND GET IT, OKAY?

37:09.430 --> 37:13.810
[BILLY] NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
WE ALL GO DOWN AND GET IT.
ALL OF US.

37:13.850 --> 37:17.860
[FOLEY] NO PROBLEM. NO PROBLEM.

37:26.320 --> 37:29.410
&lt;POLICE SIRENS WAILING&gt;

37:29.450 --> 37:32.460
&lt;♪&gt;

38:17.420 --> 38:19.460
[MAL] THAT'S DISAPPOINTING.

38:19.500 --> 38:20.840
[HOOD] WHAT'S THIS?

38:20.880 --> 38:24.300
[JAKE] JUST IF YOU'LL

38:24.340 --> 38:27.720
HOLD ONTO THIS, HOODIE.
MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL.

38:53.790 --> 38:55.750

38:58.960 --> 39:02.500

PEOPLE WHO DO ME WRONG.
YOU REMEMBER THAT.

39:02.550 --> 39:03.960
[JAKE] YEAH,
THAT'S REAL TERRIFYING.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.710
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME A CALL

39:05.760 --> 39:08.130

39:49.720 --> 39:54.100
I JUST HOPE YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
IF I DON'T SHOW UP FOR
THE ACTUAL TYING OF THE KNOT.

39:54.140 --> 39:57.220

40:29.670 --> 40:32.050
WELL, YOU KNOW,
HAVE A LOOK AND SEE.

40:34.760 --> 40:36.640
[ROSE] WHERE DID ALL THOSE
EMERALDS COME FROM?

40:36.680 --> 40:39.020
[BETH] THEY'RE FROM
MY WEDDING BAND. I MEAN,

[MAL] SO, THAT'S IT?
SHE JUST BREEZES IN AND
BACK OUT EVERY 10 YEARS?

41:14.720 --> 41:16.010
THAT'S NOT SO DEADLY.

41:16.050 --> 41:20.600
[ROSE] OH, YOU WATCH IT.
SHE'S LIKELY TO MOVE
INTO THE BASEMENT.

41:20.640 --> 41:23.350
[MAL] DID SHE JUST LEAVE

41:23.390 --> 41:28.320
[ROSE] YEP. DEAL WITH IT.

41:28.360 --> 41:31.740
[LESLIE] NO. I'LL BE RIGHT OVER,

41:57.260 --> 42:00.470
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY,

42:11.320 --> 42:16.740
[JAKE] I'M JOKING, OKAY? YOUR
SECRET IS SAFE WITH ME.

42:16.780 --> 42:18.160
[LESLIE] I WAS GONNA TELL YA.

42:18.200 --> 42:19.330
[JAKE] YOU DON'T HAVE TO
TELL ME ANYTHING, LESLIE.

42:19.370 --> 42:24.870
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS, RIGHT?
YOU'RE A FREE WOMAN, SO...

42:24.910 --> 42:26.580

42:51.570 --> 42:54.280
THEY GOING TO MAKE IT,
YOU THINK?

42:54.320 --> 42:58.950
[LESLIE] I DON'T KNOW. 'COULD BE
YEARS BEFORE THEY'RE TOGETHER.

42:58.990 --> 43:00.990
IT'S A JOB TO SAY.

43:07.210 --> 43:10.210
[JAKE] I DON'T THINK
I LIKE THE SOUNDS OF THAT.

43:15.880 --> 43:24.390
[LESLIE] ME EITHER. THEN AGAIN,
YOU NEVER KNOW. RIGHT?

43:24.430 --> 43:26.600
LIFE'S FUNNY THAT WAY.

43:28.390 --> 43:31.400
&lt;♪&gt;
