00:20.826 --> 00:23.061
Kids, before you go to school,
you want to see some art?

00:23.095 --> 00:25.763
I've already looked in the
mirror once today, so I am good.

00:25.764 --> 00:27.098
Is this a trick?

00:27.099 --> 00:28.967
We say "sure"
and then you moon us?

00:28.968 --> 00:31.970
No. You know that customer who
always doodles on his napkins?

00:31.971 --> 00:33.504
Look what he drew yesterday.

00:33.539 --> 00:34.973
Oh. It's
a fisherman.

00:34.974 --> 00:37.575
And he used the grease
stain as a lake.

00:37.610 --> 00:39.744
That's a good use of grease.

00:39.778 --> 00:41.846
You know what, maybe we should
put it up over here.

00:41.847 --> 00:44.015
Start a wall of customer
drawings, right?

00:44.049 --> 00:46.317
Huh. A wall of napkin art.
That's a good idea, Lin.

00:46.318 --> 00:48.486
It is a good idea, Mom.
But you know what isn't?

00:48.487 --> 00:50.922
Putting your coffee mug so close
to the edge of the counter.

00:50.956 --> 00:53.124
That's a piping hot cup of ouch.
Thank you, Tina.

00:53.125 --> 00:55.360
Ugh, we get it.
You're a hall monitor.

00:55.361 --> 00:57.462
Leave your work
at school.

00:57.496 --> 00:59.530
Sorry. But all my hall
monitoring is gonna pay off.

00:59.531 --> 01:01.499
I think Mr. Frond
is about to promote me

01:01.500 --> 01:03.635
to the highest hall monitor rank
there is.

01:14.013 --> 01:15.647
It's called Hall Manatee.

01:15.681 --> 01:17.482
Hall Manatee? Why
is it called that?

01:17.516 --> 01:18.816
There are two schools of thought
about that.

01:18.851 --> 01:20.685
No, never mind.
I don't want to hear. Okay.

01:22.087 --> 01:24.167
Hi, Ms. Selbo.
Signing in for hall monitor duty?

01:24.189 --> 01:25.557
You know, there's a rumor
going around

01:25.558 --> 01:26.919
that you're up
for a big promotion.

01:26.926 --> 01:28.660
Oh, don't listen to rumors,
Ms. Selbo.

01:28.694 --> 01:30.862
Then what would I do?

01:30.863 --> 01:34.098
Just answer the phone
when it rings? Tina, come on.

01:34.099 --> 01:36.534
Here's your vest.
Good luck, Mana-Tina.

01:36.535 --> 01:38.136
What? You didn't hear it
from me.

01:38.170 --> 01:40.505
Hi, Tina. I-I went
ahead and signed you in.

01:40.506 --> 01:42.340
That was thoughtful, Rudy,
but it's against the rules

01:42.341 --> 01:44.175
to forge a signature
on the sign-in sheet.

01:44.176 --> 01:46.911
Oh, yeah. The rules. I guess I
played it pretty fast and loose.

01:46.912 --> 01:49.581
Yeah, let's save fast and loose
for when you shake your caboose.

01:49.582 --> 01:51.849
Rules were made to be followed.
Right, sorry.

01:51.850 --> 01:54.197
See, that's why you're
gonna be a Hall Manatee

01:54.220 --> 01:56.087
and I'm stuck
at Hall Minnow.

01:56.088 --> 01:59.090
Well, I'm also a Hall Minnow
'cause I'm bad at networking.

01:59.124 --> 02:01.659
Third period.
Lunch is 40 minutes away.

02:01.694 --> 02:03.861
Kids are hungry and cranky,
which means out in the hallway

02:03.862 --> 02:05.196
anything can happen.
Got it.

02:05.197 --> 02:07.031
Oh, slow you didn't.

02:07.032 --> 02:09.100
Huh? I'm saying you weren't
going slow in the hall.

02:09.101 --> 02:11.536
Slow you didn't? I should have
been more clear. Sorry.

02:11.537 --> 02:14.105
Full name and grade?
Danny Duszynski, fifth.

02:14.106 --> 02:16.040
Duszynski.
Thank you, Danny.

02:16.041 --> 02:17.876
You stupid... Whoa.

02:17.877 --> 02:20.044
What's that?
Bye. Thank you.

02:20.045 --> 02:22.380
You're welcome.
Whoa, he used language.

02:22.381 --> 02:23.948
No, I think
he just said "thank you."

02:23.983 --> 02:26.251
Tina, can I just say it?
You inspire me.

02:26.252 --> 02:28.086
I know.

02:28.087 --> 02:30.722
Hold on. I recognize that
sound. It's butts on brass.

02:30.723 --> 02:32.527
Huh?
Follow me.

02:32.558 --> 02:35.627
I love gravity!
I'm glad I wore my fast pants!

02:35.628 --> 02:38.897
Hey, guys.
You just slid into detention. Nice.

02:38.931 --> 02:41.065
I'm gonna need a full name
and grade from both of you.

02:41.100 --> 02:43.334
I get it. Good psych-out, Tina.

02:43.335 --> 02:45.103
You scared us straight.

02:45.137 --> 02:46.571
Uh, full name and grade.

02:46.605 --> 02:48.273
I can't tell you
my full name!

02:48.274 --> 02:50.508
You know Mom won't tell me
my middle name!

02:50.509 --> 02:53.778
Geez, Tina, what are you,
Narcy Narc and the Narcy Bunch?

02:53.812 --> 02:55.580
Fine. Louise and Gene Belcher.

02:55.581 --> 02:57.749
All right, off to class.
And I'll see you at home.

02:57.750 --> 02:59.417
What's Mom making tonight?
Anyone know?

02:59.418 --> 03:02.754
Good talk.
Wow, that was cold-blooded.

03:02.755 --> 03:04.222
I guess when you're
a hall monitor

03:04.256 --> 03:05.990
you have to leave
your feelings in your locker.

03:05.991 --> 03:08.393
And lose the combination.
Yeah...

03:08.427 --> 03:10.649
Hall
monitors on duty, report immediately

03:10.663 --> 03:12.664
to Coach Blevins' office.
Uh-oh.

03:12.665 --> 03:14.766
Let's move.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.801
Let me go. Dang.

03:16.802 --> 03:19.137
Ugh, Zeke.
You called us, Mr. Frond?

03:19.138 --> 03:21.139
Ah, Tina.
My star hall monitor.

03:21.140 --> 03:24.809
And Regular Sized Rudy.
My fixer-upper hall monitor.

03:24.844 --> 03:27.111
I'll get there.
Anyway, I stepped away from class

03:27.112 --> 03:30.448
to retrieve my shatterproof
Suh-weet.

03:30.449 --> 03:32.050
Thanks. When I got to my office,

03:32.051 --> 03:34.152
I found Zeke in here
digging around.

03:34.186 --> 03:35.787
Trespassing
in a teacher's office.

03:35.788 --> 03:37.288
This is strike three
for you, Zeke.

03:37.289 --> 03:39.257
I'm afraid
that means automatic suspension.

03:39.291 --> 03:41.526
Uh, but I got a good reason.

03:41.560 --> 03:43.294
Save it. Tina, I need you
to escort Zeke

03:43.295 --> 03:44.762
to the principal's
office.

03:44.797 --> 03:46.464
I'd do it myself,
but I dropped my cell phone

03:46.465 --> 03:48.700
in the toilet, and I need
to put it in rice immediately.

03:48.701 --> 03:50.355
Has anyone tried that?
Does it work?

03:50.369 --> 03:52.399
Ha! Mr. Frond's got
a smell phone.

03:52.404 --> 03:54.172
You're suspended.

03:54.173 --> 03:56.174
Tina,
think you can handle this?

03:56.175 --> 03:57.529
I don't think
you can handle

03:57.543 --> 03:58.977
how much I can handle this,
Mr. Frond.

03:58.978 --> 04:00.712
Let's go, Zeke.

04:00.713 --> 04:02.647
I'll take it from here, Rudy.
You finish your rounds.

04:02.648 --> 04:04.315
Are you sure?
Zeke's trouble.

04:04.316 --> 04:06.551
It's a midday run.
I could do it in my sleep.

04:06.585 --> 04:09.220
Yeah, but I want to help.
I've never transported a perp.

04:09.221 --> 04:11.322
Yeah, we're good, Rudy.
Oh. Oh, wow.

04:11.323 --> 04:12.891
Tina's giving Rudy some 'tude-y.

04:12.892 --> 04:14.859
Shut up, Zeke. I'm
sorry I said "shut up."

04:14.860 --> 04:16.094
You shut up.

04:17.495 --> 04:19.664
Look what Teddy did!
Funky pattern.

04:19.665 --> 04:20.865
I'm putting it up!

04:20.899 --> 04:21.899
Spirals, right?

04:21.934 --> 04:23.101
Welcome to my brain.

04:23.102 --> 04:24.702
Look at mine, Linda. Aw,

04:24.737 --> 04:26.371
it's a sun wearing sunglasses.

04:26.405 --> 04:28.239
Someone's feeling silly.

04:28.240 --> 04:30.353
Guilty! Uh, here you go.
Here's mine.

04:30.376 --> 04:31.943
Ah. Ooh.
Yeah.

04:31.944 --> 04:33.812
What is it?
It's a face.

04:33.846 --> 04:36.014
I don't recognize it.
Well, it's no one in particular.

04:36.015 --> 04:38.416
It's just a face.
Hmm. Could it be a foot?

04:38.417 --> 04:41.586
Oh, I see it now!
It's a beautiful face.

04:41.620 --> 04:43.154
So are you gonna put it
on the wall?

04:43.189 --> 04:45.690
What? Yeah. S-Sure.
Yeah, of cour...

04:45.691 --> 04:48.593
I'm gonna put it up. Wall. Well,
it doesn't seem like you want to.

04:48.594 --> 04:50.428
Oh, here's a spot for it.
Right there. Uh.

04:50.429 --> 04:52.864
Wait. Y... Lin, you're putting
it behind the coffee machine.

04:52.865 --> 04:54.466
Am I?
Forget it. If...

04:54.467 --> 04:56.267
I-I don't want you
to put it up

04:56.268 --> 04:57.535
if you don't like it.
Okay.

04:57.570 --> 04:59.270
That was close.
We were gonna have to look

04:59.271 --> 05:01.106
at that thing every time
they moved the coffee pot.

05:01.140 --> 05:02.807
Sorry, Teddy.
Sorry it's not a spiral

05:02.808 --> 05:04.909
or a sun
with sunglasses.

05:04.910 --> 05:06.978
Speaking of spirals... Whoa!

05:06.979 --> 05:09.748
Right? Oh, I'm dizzy!
Another one's going up!

05:09.749 --> 05:11.950
Oh, my God. Put it...
put it right there.

05:11.951 --> 05:13.952
Come on! The time
doesn't fit the crime.

05:13.953 --> 05:15.565
You got to
let me go!

05:15.588 --> 05:16.921
Enough, Zeke.
You're the one

05:16.922 --> 05:18.723
who broke into
the gym teacher's office.

05:18.724 --> 05:20.925
Okay, listen,
I did it for my grandma.

05:20.926 --> 05:21.925
Sure you did.

05:21.927 --> 05:24.062
Well, can I at least

05:24.063 --> 05:26.197
use the bathroom
before you turn me in?

05:26.232 --> 05:27.932
I don't think so.
Please!

05:27.933 --> 05:30.201
Have a heart, Tina! Good gosh.

05:30.236 --> 05:31.469
Okay. But make it quick.

05:31.470 --> 05:33.037
All right!
Thanks, T-Bird!

05:33.072 --> 05:35.306
Okay.

05:37.243 --> 05:40.245
Zeke? Zeke, as your hall
monitor, I'm ordering you:

05:40.246 --> 05:42.881
Come out with your hands washed.

05:42.915 --> 05:44.449
That's odd.

05:44.483 --> 05:46.918
Anybody in here?
I'm coming in on 90% official

05:46.919 --> 05:50.433
hall monitor business.
And 10% curiosity. Zeke?

05:50.456 --> 05:52.457
Answer me, Zeke. I know you're
in there. I can see your shoes.

05:52.458 --> 05:54.192
Huh. Where'd your legs go?

05:55.528 --> 05:57.295
What the... Oh, no.

05:58.431 --> 06:00.098
I lost Zeke.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.268
- Aah! Tina.
-  Mr. Frond.

06:03.302 --> 06:05.070
How'd it go?
Did Zeke give you any trouble?

06:05.104 --> 06:06.938
Well, uh...
Of course he did.

06:06.939 --> 06:08.540
But I'm sure you
handled it, right?

06:10.843 --> 06:14.079
Tina?
Tina?

06:14.113 --> 06:15.847
God, that sound makes me queasy, Tina.
It went great.

06:15.848 --> 06:17.816
I dropped him off at the principal,
and the principal said,

06:17.817 --> 06:19.484
"Thank you,
Tina." Everything was fine. Terrific.

06:19.485 --> 06:20.919
That's why you're the best.

06:20.953 --> 06:22.354
Stop it!

06:22.355 --> 06:24.356
Tina.

06:24.357 --> 06:26.524
Liar.

06:28.675 --> 06:31.076
Zeke.

06:32.679 --> 06:36.014
Zeke. Come out.

06:36.015 --> 06:38.016
Everyone's...
wrestling out here.

06:38.017 --> 06:39.918
I'm being wrestled.
Oh, hey, Tina.

06:39.919 --> 06:42.855
Ah! Sorry to interrupt.
Everything okay with Zeke?

06:42.856 --> 06:44.957
Everything's fine.
What a weird thing to bring up.

06:44.991 --> 06:46.725
Come on.
It's Regular Sized Rudy.

06:46.726 --> 06:48.927
You can talk regular to me.
Everything is great, Rudy!

06:48.928 --> 06:50.896
It's really, really, really,
really great! Okay, but...

06:50.930 --> 06:52.865
it just seem... Got to go.
Everything's great. See you soon.

06:52.866 --> 06:54.933
I can't believe it.
My hero's gone dirty.

06:54.934 --> 06:57.536
Stand down, feelings.
Stand down.

06:57.537 --> 07:00.339
Time for Rudy to clean up
this mess.

07:02.042 --> 07:03.909
It's almost lunchtime.

07:03.943 --> 07:06.578
Once these halls fill up with
people, I'll never find Zeke.

07:06.579 --> 07:08.514
I should call for backup.

07:08.515 --> 07:10.049
Why'd you pull us out
of class?

07:10.050 --> 07:11.550
Yeah, I was
learning stuff!

07:11.584 --> 07:12.724
You guys, I need your help.

07:12.752 --> 07:14.953
Oh, do you?
You busted us today

07:14.954 --> 07:17.790
like we were just a couple
of butt-sliding strangers!

07:17.791 --> 07:20.893
Yeah! We all slid out of
the same place, sister!

07:20.927 --> 07:23.362
It was nothing personal.
Well, then nothing personal,

07:23.363 --> 07:25.931
but if you want our help,
it's gonna cost you big-time!

07:25.932 --> 07:28.867
Yeah! Ok-Okay, um,
I-I can give you each a hall pass.

07:28.868 --> 07:32.037
Is that all?
Then we will <i> pass</i> on that offer.

07:32.038 --> 07:33.939
Wait!
What if I could give you...

07:33.973 --> 07:35.607
A permanent hall pass?

07:35.608 --> 07:37.776
A perma-pass? Is that real?

07:37.777 --> 07:41.714
Could it be? One hall pass
to rule them all.

07:41.715 --> 07:44.550
It exists, but only for kids
with serious medical conditions.

07:44.551 --> 07:46.385
Lucky!
So we help you get promoted...

07:46.386 --> 07:48.554
And these halls are yours.
All right.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.689
You got our attention.
What's the job?

07:50.724 --> 07:52.958
I lost Zeke. I was supposed
to get him to the office,

07:52.959 --> 07:55.594
but he got away. I need you
to help me get him back.

07:55.595 --> 07:57.329
Is that all? Think, Tina.

07:57.330 --> 08:00.432
How do you find someone
who doesn't want to be found?

08:00.433 --> 08:03.068
You rough up
that someone's friend.

08:03.069 --> 08:05.304
Jimmy Jr.? Oh, I don't think
we need to ask him anything

08:05.305 --> 08:07.139
about this.
Want to get Zeke?

08:07.140 --> 08:08.607
Then suck it up, T.

08:08.608 --> 08:10.609
J-Ju! Buddy!
What's going on, man?

08:10.610 --> 08:12.311
What do you want, Louise?

08:12.345 --> 08:14.613
What do I want?
 I want to chat.

08:14.614 --> 08:16.649
Watch for
lunch ladies and Feds.

08:16.683 --> 08:18.751
All right, where is he?
Where is who?

08:18.752 --> 08:20.986
Your buddy Zeke.
He's hiding somewhere in school.

08:21.021 --> 08:22.655
I-I don't know anything
about it.

08:22.689 --> 08:24.790
Oh, no? Tell me something.
You're a dancer.

08:24.791 --> 08:28.027
How important is it for
a dancer to have toes?!

08:28.028 --> 08:30.296
Uh, that didn't hurt, Louise.
Why not?!

08:30.297 --> 08:31.897
That was my whole body!

08:31.932 --> 08:34.732
I'm wearing thick socks?
Okay. Take your socks off.

08:34.768 --> 08:37.135
No. Where's Zeke, Jimmy Jr.?!

08:37.169 --> 08:39.171
Whoa. Yikes.
I told your sister, Tina,

08:39.172 --> 08:41.506
I don't know.
That's not good enough.

08:41.541 --> 08:43.741
Ew, Tina, this tray is gross!

08:43.777 --> 08:45.844
Too bad you chose chowder day
to lie to me.

08:45.879 --> 08:46.779
It's chowder day?

08:46.780 --> 08:48.280
Okay! I don't know for sure,

08:48.281 --> 08:49.949
but there's a place
Zeke goes sometimes.

08:49.950 --> 08:51.784
He calls it his hidey-hole.

08:51.785 --> 08:53.786
Where is it?
Stop it, Tina!

08:53.787 --> 08:56.789
The storage room!
Over by the science lab!

08:56.790 --> 08:58.023
Now take off your socks!

08:58.058 --> 08:58.991
Yeah, take off your socks!

08:58.992 --> 08:59.825
Okay!

08:59.826 --> 09:01.660
Oh, wait.

09:01.661 --> 09:03.729
Um, don't take off your socks.
Put them back on. Sorry.

09:03.730 --> 09:06.198
Yeah, it wouldn't make much sense.
Wait, so put 'em back on or...

09:06.233 --> 09:07.833
- Put it back on!
- Okay!

09:07.834 --> 09:08.701
Faster! Faster!

09:08.735 --> 09:09.735
It's not going on!

09:09.736 --> 09:11.170
Put them on! Now!

09:11.171 --> 09:12.671
They're all sweaty!

09:14.074 --> 09:16.175
Okay. A little
shading over here.

09:16.176 --> 09:18.510
Looks good. Uh,
Lin, take a look.

09:18.511 --> 09:19.945
I did another one.

09:19.980 --> 09:22.047
Mmm. Hmm.

09:22.082 --> 09:24.083
I went back to the
drawing board. Literally.

09:24.084 --> 09:26.352
And I...
and I drew something

09:26.353 --> 09:28.554
I know I could never
mess up... a burger.

09:28.555 --> 09:30.356
Yeah. It's good.

09:30.390 --> 09:33.192
Oh, my God. You are so bad
at pretending you like it.

09:33.193 --> 09:35.594
What are you talking about?
It's so good I want to eat it.

09:35.595 --> 09:37.429
Look, I just ate it.

09:37.430 --> 09:39.064
Okay, let's put it up.
We'll put it up.

09:39.099 --> 09:40.933
No, Lin, I-I don't want
a sympathy hang.

09:40.934 --> 09:42.368
Do you like it or not?

09:42.402 --> 09:43.401
Mike the Mailman!

09:43.403 --> 09:46.205
Get in here! Talk to us! Please.

09:46.239 --> 09:47.673
You know what, don't
use Mike as an excuse

09:47.674 --> 09:49.341
to change the
subject, Lin.

09:49.342 --> 09:51.844
What was the subject?
Your marriage? What?

09:51.845 --> 09:55.347
Oh, doodle wall, huh? Yeah!
What do you think, huh? Artsy.

09:55.382 --> 09:58.083
May I?
Boom. 3-D cube.

09:58.118 --> 10:00.553
Oh, my God, it's perfect!
Mmm. That's good.

10:00.554 --> 10:02.388
Yeah.
Oh, it's jumping out at me!

10:02.389 --> 10:03.895
Oh. Oh, it's going
on the wall.

10:03.924 --> 10:06.091
You know what the trick is?
Draw a square,

10:06.092 --> 10:07.760
draw another square,
connect 'em.

10:07.794 --> 10:09.295
See, you never know.
People could be a mailman

10:09.296 --> 10:10.729
but they're also an artist.

10:10.730 --> 10:12.731
Why is everybody good
at this but me?!

10:12.732 --> 10:15.167
Okay, someone's jealous.
I love it, Mike.

10:15.202 --> 10:16.902
Whoa. This is a good hidey-hole.

10:16.937 --> 10:20.072
What this room really
needs is a desk.

10:20.106 --> 10:22.608
Zeke? You in here?
You go low, we'll go high.

10:23.877 --> 10:25.110
Look!

10:25.111 --> 10:26.245
You see him?

10:26.279 --> 10:27.880
No, it's a box of chalk nubs!

10:27.881 --> 10:29.128
Nub party!

10:30.617 --> 10:32.384
Zeke, I can hear you.

10:32.385 --> 10:34.386
There! There he is! Uh-oh.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.662
Get out, Tina!

10:45.232 --> 10:46.565
You have nowhere
left to crawl.

10:46.566 --> 10:48.801
I told you, I'm innocent!

10:48.802 --> 10:50.436
I don't care.

10:50.470 --> 10:52.671
All right, only one
thing left to do.

10:52.672 --> 10:54.140
Jump to freedom!

10:54.141 --> 10:55.574
I'm coming, Grandma!

10:56.843 --> 10:58.911
You still have
nowhere left to crawl.

10:58.945 --> 11:00.513
What is this?

11:00.514 --> 11:03.082
Chinese finger trap.
I got it as a party favor.

11:03.083 --> 11:04.316
But in America.
All right.

11:04.317 --> 11:05.985
Is there
a trick to it?

11:05.986 --> 11:07.820
Don't tell me.

11:07.821 --> 11:09.522
Okay, tell me.
No.

11:09.523 --> 11:11.924
Got your man, Tina.
And I'm eating this chalk.

11:11.925 --> 11:13.492
We <i> all</i> did good.

11:15.352 --> 11:17.186
I'll take it from here, guys.
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

11:17.187 --> 11:19.155
What about our perma-passes?

11:19.189 --> 11:20.490
Those exist? Dang!

11:20.491 --> 11:22.525
I heard they tattoo 'em
on your neck

11:22.526 --> 11:25.428
and it hurts, but it's worth it.
No, but they're laminated.

11:25.429 --> 11:27.864
Here. If anyone asks, you
have irritable bowel syndrome.

11:27.865 --> 11:29.398
All bowels are
irritable.

11:29.399 --> 11:31.067
Hey, ticket to ride.
I'm Louise.

11:31.068 --> 11:32.702
Let's roll.

11:32.703 --> 11:34.904
Let's go everywhere in
the world except class.

11:37.441 --> 11:39.442
It's almost like
the harder I pull,

11:39.443 --> 11:41.077
the tighter it gets.

11:41.078 --> 11:43.579
Aha! Found you!

11:43.580 --> 11:45.181
Rudy!
You lied to Mr. Frond!

11:45.182 --> 11:46.582
You said you
delivered Zeke.

11:46.583 --> 11:48.351
I am delivering
him. Now.

11:48.352 --> 11:49.585
Back off, Rudy.

11:49.620 --> 11:52.155
You were my hero.
Now look at you!

11:52.189 --> 11:53.756
Dang!
Zeke's coming with me.

11:53.757 --> 11:55.691
Easy, squirt.
Detach him, Tina.

11:55.692 --> 11:58.394
I'm bringing Zeke in,
and I'm reporting you to Mr. Frond.

11:58.395 --> 12:01.430
You blew it, man. No!
I worked too hard for this promotion.

12:01.431 --> 12:03.533
Hand over the Zeke!

12:05.135 --> 12:07.103
Lunch is over.
Hey, look, uh,

12:07.104 --> 12:08.871
a kid, uh, doing
something dangerous

12:08.872 --> 12:11.774
and breaking a rule.
Oh, rules are... Oh.

12:11.809 --> 12:12.808
Hey, come back!

12:12.810 --> 12:14.310
What are you doing!

12:14.311 --> 12:16.045
The principal's office
is the other way.

12:16.046 --> 12:17.780
There's more than one way
to the principal's office.

12:17.781 --> 12:18.915
There are two ways.

12:20.484 --> 12:21.717
Here we go.

12:21.718 --> 12:23.219
This guy.
What?!

12:23.220 --> 12:24.921
Hi. Uh, so, um,

12:24.922 --> 12:27.223
I need a quick
drawing lesson.

12:27.257 --> 12:30.259
Oh, you must mean the
Emergency Drawing Package.

12:30.294 --> 12:31.527
Yes. D-Do you have that?

12:31.562 --> 12:33.262
No! 'Cause there's
no such thing!

12:33.263 --> 12:35.898
Takes years of training
to be an artist. Years!

12:35.933 --> 12:37.900
Look, you're
the only real artists I know.

12:37.901 --> 12:39.635
You're very talented.

12:39.670 --> 12:41.604
Well, actually,
Harold's not that good.

12:41.605 --> 12:43.272
I'm-I'm fair.
You're not, honey.

12:43.273 --> 12:44.574
I am!
You know you aren't.

12:44.575 --> 12:45.808
Okay.

12:45.843 --> 12:47.410
Look, I would
really appreciate it

12:47.411 --> 12:49.412
if you'd help me...
I'd be... honored.

12:49.446 --> 12:50.947
All right.
Stop groveling!

12:50.948 --> 12:52.748
We'll give you
a crash course.

12:52.783 --> 12:53.950
Really? Thank you.

12:53.951 --> 12:55.118
I'll set up
the studio.

12:55.119 --> 12:56.786
Harold, sell him
the supplies.

12:56.787 --> 12:58.321
All right. $30!

12:58.322 --> 13:00.323
For a pencil
and a pad of paper?

13:00.324 --> 13:02.191
You want to learn to draw?!
Pay the man!

13:02.192 --> 13:03.426
All right, all right,
all right.

13:03.427 --> 13:05.027
Come on, we just
need to get around

13:05.028 --> 13:06.295
to the front of the school.

13:06.296 --> 13:07.797
Can I ask you something?

13:07.831 --> 13:09.532
Why do you want to be
a hall monitor, anyway?

13:09.533 --> 13:10.666
It's just
telling on kids.

13:10.667 --> 13:11.801
It's not telling on kids.

13:11.802 --> 13:13.436
It's helping on kids.

13:13.437 --> 13:14.937
Well, you aren't
helping on me.

13:14.938 --> 13:16.305
It's your own fault.

13:16.306 --> 13:18.141
You've committed a series
of Mr. Wieners.

13:18.142 --> 13:19.842
That's what I call
misdemeanors. Cool.

13:19.843 --> 13:22.111
Funny words make
the job fun. Yeah.

13:22.146 --> 13:24.380
Listen, this is the truth.
I broke into Coach's office

13:24.381 --> 13:26.082
so I could take
the mascot uniform.

13:26.116 --> 13:27.683
The Wagstaff Whaler? Why?

13:27.718 --> 13:29.385
I told you...
for my grandma.

13:29.386 --> 13:31.220
She's having surgery today,
and I just wanted

13:31.221 --> 13:33.523
to mascot around for her before
she went under the knife.

13:33.524 --> 13:35.658
You expect me to
believe that? Yeah.

13:35.692 --> 13:37.627
Grandma likes mascots.
She met my grandpa

13:37.628 --> 13:39.328
when they were
mascottin' in college.

13:39.329 --> 13:41.030
They looked into each other's
big dumb foam eyes,

13:41.031 --> 13:42.298
and that was it.

13:42.299 --> 13:43.566
Miss Labonz!
If she sees us,

13:43.567 --> 13:44.734
we'll be in
big trouble.

13:44.735 --> 13:46.736
What are you two kids
doing outside?

13:46.737 --> 13:48.037
Uh...

13:48.071 --> 13:49.906
What are <i> you</i> doing, Miss L?

13:49.907 --> 13:51.207
Smoking. Cool.

13:51.241 --> 13:53.209
Smoking is not cool, Zeke.

13:53.243 --> 13:55.444
Yes, it is.
N-No, it's not.

13:55.479 --> 13:57.814
Especially when teachers
do it. That's cool!

13:57.848 --> 13:59.348
It's like you're
teaching me to smoke.

13:59.349 --> 14:00.983
I love this stuff! Don't...
Stop saying that, Zeke.

14:00.984 --> 14:02.552
We're like
best friends, man.

14:02.586 --> 14:04.720
No, we're not. No.
We're bonding over cigarettes.

14:04.721 --> 14:06.622
That's pretty cool.
We are not bonding over cigarettes!

14:06.657 --> 14:07.890
Sure we are.

14:07.925 --> 14:09.325
Hey, hey, let me get
one of those!

14:09.326 --> 14:11.027
I've been dying to try
one of them.

14:11.028 --> 14:12.862
You two get to class!
Come on, throw one in my mouth.

14:12.863 --> 14:14.497
I'll see if I can catch it.
Stop. Stop talking to me.

14:14.531 --> 14:16.566
Took care of that.
Adults get really nervous

14:16.567 --> 14:18.501
when you ask them
for cigarettes.

14:18.502 --> 14:20.903
Quick thinking. Thanks.
That's how you help a kid.

14:20.904 --> 14:22.438
Not by being a narc.

14:24.942 --> 14:27.977
Whoa. Okay,
what's happening, exactly?

14:28.011 --> 14:29.846
Life drawing.
If you can draw a nude figure,

14:29.847 --> 14:31.147
you can draw anything.

14:31.181 --> 14:32.715
Grab your charcoal,
Charlie!

14:32.716 --> 14:34.550
Lady's a-waitin'.
Okay, um,

14:34.551 --> 14:36.085
wha-what do I draw first?

14:36.119 --> 14:38.187
The gesture,
and then the essence,

14:38.222 --> 14:40.590
and then the breasts.
I don't see you drawing!

14:40.591 --> 14:42.225
Sorry, I can't look up.

14:42.259 --> 14:43.993
Harold, be my eyes...
how's he doing?

14:44.027 --> 14:45.294
Bad.
Listen, I'm trying.

14:45.295 --> 14:46.762
I just can't breathe
right now.

14:46.797 --> 14:48.598
Oh, you don't like
what you see, huh?

14:48.632 --> 14:49.999
Oh, it's good.
No, it's fine.

14:50.033 --> 14:51.601
Get used to it...
it's the human form.

14:51.602 --> 14:53.035
It's the most beautiful thing

14:53.036 --> 14:54.437
you're ever gonna see
in your life.

14:54.471 --> 14:56.138
It's super yummy.

14:56.139 --> 14:59.075
Tell him!
I just wasn't expecting the hair.

15:04.548 --> 15:07.717
If you don't let me go,
I'm gonna chew my finger off!

15:07.718 --> 15:10.586
Zeke! Come on! Grandma's gonna have
to leave for the hospital soon!

15:10.587 --> 15:12.421
Even if what you
were saying was true,

15:12.422 --> 15:14.423
you still should have asked
for the mascot suit.

15:14.458 --> 15:16.959
I did. I asked Coach B
if I could borrow the suit

15:16.960 --> 15:18.594
fair and square,
but he wouldn't let me.

15:18.595 --> 15:20.229
Probably thought
I was gonna poop in it.

15:20.230 --> 15:21.864
Just 'cause I used
to poop in stuff.

15:21.899 --> 15:24.433
Give it up, Zeke.
Almost there. Oh, Rudy.

15:24.434 --> 15:27.103
Tina, you leave me no choice.

15:27.104 --> 15:29.672
Mr. Frond...!
No!

15:29.673 --> 15:31.774
Zeke? You should be
in the principal's office.

15:31.775 --> 15:34.577
He was... um, 'cause
I took him, obviously.

15:34.578 --> 15:37.079
She never took him.
She never took him.

15:37.114 --> 15:39.482
Tina, is this true?

15:39.483 --> 15:41.417
Yes. How's your
cell phone doing?

15:41.418 --> 15:43.452
It's dead.
Oh, I heard that rice thing,

15:43.453 --> 15:45.788
that that's supposed to...
I'm very disappointed in you, Tina.

15:45.789 --> 15:47.590
Clearly you couldn't handle
this responsibility.

15:47.591 --> 15:50.459
Now, un-trap your fingers.
You say that like it's easy.

15:51.495 --> 15:52.628
Oh...!

15:52.629 --> 15:53.911
Let's do it again!

15:55.399 --> 15:57.400
Hi, Ms. Selbo.
Hi, Tina.

15:57.401 --> 15:59.735
I heard a rumor
that you were disgraced. What?

15:59.736 --> 16:01.103
Wagstaff front desk.

16:01.104 --> 16:02.305
You're calling
from where, ma'am?

16:02.339 --> 16:03.639
The Elegant Doily
Retirement Home?

16:03.640 --> 16:05.174
Oh, that's right
down the street.

16:05.175 --> 16:06.976
Sometimes your
wanderers come here.

16:06.977 --> 16:08.477
Well, I don't know
if your grandson

16:08.478 --> 16:10.313
is still coming
to visit... who is he?

16:10.314 --> 16:12.782
Oh, Zeke. I'll see
if I can find him for you.

16:12.816 --> 16:15.551
Zeke <i> was</i> telling the truth.

16:15.552 --> 16:18.187
Perma-pass! We can do anything
we want within limits!

16:18.188 --> 16:20.790
Hey, uh, guys, listen,
I owe you both an apology.

16:20.791 --> 16:22.792
Yeah. My ambition
got the best of me.

16:22.793 --> 16:24.260
Uh-huh.

16:24.294 --> 16:26.362
I've let it turn me
into a bad hall monitor

16:26.363 --> 16:27.496
and an even worse sister.

16:27.531 --> 16:28.598
Yes, you did.

16:28.632 --> 16:29.631
I'm sorry.

16:29.633 --> 16:31.234
We forgive you.
Gene!

16:31.235 --> 16:33.469
Leave her hanging
for a <i> second.</i>

16:33.470 --> 16:35.304
Shove your apology!
Yeah!

16:35.339 --> 16:37.073
That's fair. Okay, okay.
We forgive you.

16:37.074 --> 16:38.207
Ah, thank you.

16:38.242 --> 16:39.408
And there's one more thing.

16:39.409 --> 16:40.610
We need to help Zeke.

16:40.644 --> 16:42.144
Tina, I hate
to tell you this,

16:42.145 --> 16:43.498
but that's not Zeke.

16:44.927 --> 16:46.894
Okay, Zeke is in
the principal's office

16:46.895 --> 16:48.729
being watched by
Ms. Schnur and Mr. Frond.

16:48.730 --> 16:51.232
The principal naps in his car
every day until 1:45.

16:51.233 --> 16:53.201
That gives us seven minutes
to spring Zeke.

16:53.202 --> 16:55.303
How are we gonna
get past Mr. Frond?

16:55.304 --> 16:57.905
Forget Frond... it's Ms. Schnur
you've got to worry about.

16:57.906 --> 17:00.608
She's short, but she's got
a seven-foot wingspan.

17:00.609 --> 17:02.276
It's okay.
I have an idea.

17:02.311 --> 17:04.478
I told you, my grandma's
about to go under...

17:04.479 --> 17:06.848
Oh, spare me
the grandma stuff.

17:06.882 --> 17:09.517
Grandma excuses are older
than grandmas themselves.

17:09.550 --> 17:11.551
Hey, Penny Marshall's outside!

17:11.587 --> 17:13.087
<i>The</i> Penny Marshall?!

17:13.121 --> 17:14.589
Yeah. And she
said something

17:14.589 --> 17:16.457
about needing a
new best friend.

17:16.492 --> 17:18.092
That could be me!

17:18.126 --> 17:20.728
Ms. Schnur, Penny Marshall
is not outside.

17:20.729 --> 17:24.397
Mr. Frond, if she is out there
and I don't go out,

17:24.398 --> 17:26.601
I will never forgive myself!

17:26.635 --> 17:27.635
Out of my way!
Ms. Schnur, no!

17:27.669 --> 17:28.603
Zeke, run!

17:28.604 --> 17:30.238
Come here, get up.

17:30.239 --> 17:32.306
Uh, counsel me.
No, counsel me.

17:32.341 --> 17:33.474
Not now. Counsel me! Counsel me!

17:33.475 --> 17:34.909
I'm messed up!
I'm a big mess!

17:34.943 --> 17:35.977
Zeke.

17:36.011 --> 17:37.011
What's going on?

17:37.012 --> 17:38.179
Take it.
What?

17:38.180 --> 17:39.747
And go.
Damn, Tina.

17:39.748 --> 17:41.649
Now I got a story
to tell on our wedding day.

17:41.650 --> 17:43.584
You think that's not gonna
happen, but I'll get you, girl.

17:43.585 --> 17:44.886
I'm gonna get you.

17:44.920 --> 17:46.521
Okay, d-don't say
anything, just go.

17:46.522 --> 17:47.755
Zeke, come back here!

17:47.756 --> 17:49.457
Let him go, Mr. Frond.

17:49.458 --> 17:51.158
He's going to see his grandma
before she has surgery.

17:51.193 --> 17:52.693
His grandma?

17:52.694 --> 17:55.396
You naive little wide-eyed
candy-dandy fool.

17:55.430 --> 17:56.998
This is Zeke
we're talking about.

17:56.999 --> 17:58.332
Once, he faked lice.

17:58.333 --> 17:59.967
I think he used Sea-Monkeys.

18:00.002 --> 18:02.303
But I was in Ms. Selbo's office
when his grandma called.

18:02.337 --> 18:04.939
Anyone can get a friend to
pretend to be someone's grandma.

18:04.940 --> 18:06.941
There are services
that do that.

18:06.942 --> 18:08.776
Mr. Frond, we're
hall monitors.

18:08.777 --> 18:10.511
But people
aren't halls.

18:10.546 --> 18:11.679
Tell that to Darryl Hall.

18:11.680 --> 18:12.780
And Anthony Michael Hall.

18:12.781 --> 18:14.015
Arsenio Hall.

18:14.016 --> 18:15.683
Okay, a lot of
people are Halls.

18:15.684 --> 18:17.852
But what I'm saying is
people are complicated.

18:17.853 --> 18:19.287
Life is complicated.

18:19.288 --> 18:21.389
And sometimes
even liars tell the truth.

18:21.390 --> 18:22.389
I believe Zeke.

18:22.391 --> 18:23.624
You do, huh?

18:23.625 --> 18:25.626
Okay, I'll bet you he's lying.

18:25.627 --> 18:27.628
If I'm wrong,
you're not in trouble.

18:27.629 --> 18:29.597
And, what the heck,
I'll give you your promotion.

18:29.631 --> 18:31.132
Forget the promotion.

18:31.133 --> 18:32.500
If you're wrong,
Zeke's not suspended.

18:32.534 --> 18:34.969
Sure, I'll even throw in
some ice cream

18:34.970 --> 18:37.805
for Zeke's imaginary granny
after her imaginary surgery.

18:37.806 --> 18:40.374
And you have to marry
her for citizenship.

18:40.375 --> 18:42.043
What happens
if Tina loses?

18:42.044 --> 18:43.878
One month's detention.

18:43.879 --> 18:45.046
And you turn in
your vest.

18:45.047 --> 18:46.314
And your finger trap.

18:46.315 --> 18:47.682
But that's mine.
If I win, I want it.

18:47.716 --> 18:48.983
Cool bet, Tina.

18:48.984 --> 18:50.685
But Zeke does this kind
of thing a lot.

18:50.686 --> 18:51.819
And that's coming
from a girl

18:51.820 --> 18:53.321
who does this kind
of thing a lot.

18:53.322 --> 18:55.356
Yeah, think about it, T.

18:55.390 --> 18:57.024
You're on, Frond.

18:57.059 --> 18:58.059
Terrific.

18:58.060 --> 18:59.060
To the nursing home!

18:59.061 --> 19:00.061
We're coming, too.

19:00.062 --> 19:01.162
- Yeah!
- Great!

19:01.196 --> 19:02.430
Come along.

19:02.431 --> 19:03.865
W-wait, where's
everybody going?

19:03.866 --> 19:05.500
We're going on a "splash
of cold hard truth

19:05.501 --> 19:06.767
in Tina's face"
field trip!

19:06.768 --> 19:08.272
I didn't get a
slip for that.

19:09.338 --> 19:12.039
Okay, here we are.

19:12.074 --> 19:13.508
Zeke's grandma?

19:13.509 --> 19:14.842
Is Zeke's
grandma here?

19:14.877 --> 19:16.144
Yes.

19:16.178 --> 19:18.179
Yep, that is definitely
Zeke's grandma.

19:18.180 --> 19:19.180
Huh?

19:19.181 --> 19:20.781
Oh, that's strange.

19:20.782 --> 19:23.351
There's Zeke's grandma,
but I don't see Zeke anywhere.

19:23.352 --> 19:24.919
Maybe that's because...

19:24.920 --> 19:27.922
Liars are liars,
and people are bad.

19:27.923 --> 19:31.092
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh,
I am right!

19:31.093 --> 19:33.494
Are you my surgeon?

19:33.529 --> 19:35.129
I can't believe
Zeke's not here.

19:35.130 --> 19:36.430
Sorry, Tina.

19:36.431 --> 19:38.466
I was kind of hoping
he would be here, too.

19:38.467 --> 19:39.901
Y'all ready for this?!

19:39.902 --> 19:41.903
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:46.775 --> 19:48.776
You lose, Frond.

19:48.777 --> 19:50.111
You lose!

19:52.114 --> 19:53.581
Whalers in the front!

19:54.583 --> 19:55.783
Let me hear you grunt!

19:56.785 --> 19:57.885
That's my boy.

19:57.920 --> 19:59.787
Ice cream time!

19:59.788 --> 20:01.055
There's
an ice cream truck

20:01.056 --> 20:02.557
around here somewhere,
Mr. Frond.

20:02.558 --> 20:03.724
Better go find it.

20:03.725 --> 20:05.293
Okay, okay,
okay, I'm going.

20:05.294 --> 20:06.494
Walk, don't run.

20:06.495 --> 20:07.495
Nice!

20:08.564 --> 20:09.931
There you are.

20:09.932 --> 20:11.265
Where were you?

20:11.300 --> 20:12.733
Did you go to the store
or something?

20:12.734 --> 20:13.968
I did, in a way.

20:13.969 --> 20:15.970
And what I bought
was a new me.

20:15.971 --> 20:17.572
A me who can draw!

20:17.573 --> 20:18.573
Look at this, Lin.

20:19.575 --> 20:20.575
It's naked Edith!

20:20.576 --> 20:21.776
It's good.

20:21.777 --> 20:23.745
Kids, look... it's
naked Edith.

20:23.746 --> 20:25.413
Naked Edith!
Naked Edith!

20:25.414 --> 20:26.647
Saggy and
sophisticated.

20:26.648 --> 20:28.249
Just like it says
on her bumper sticker.

20:28.250 --> 20:29.283
Mm-hmm.

20:29.318 --> 20:30.785
Oh, oh, look what I'm doing.

20:30.786 --> 20:32.253
Right now.
Look, look where it's going.

20:32.287 --> 20:33.454
Really?
Yep.

20:33.455 --> 20:34.489
I made the wall.

20:34.490 --> 20:36.090
You made the
wall <i> sexy.</i>

20:36.091 --> 20:37.925
Look at all those nooks
and crannies.

20:37.926 --> 20:39.727
Yeah,
lotta-lotta folds.

20:49.805 --> 20:51.806
Whalers in the front!

20:51.807 --> 20:53.808
Let me hear you grunt!

20:56.445 --> 20:58.446
Whalers in the front!

20:58.447 --> 21:00.448
Let me hear you grunt!
