00:07.591 --> 00:10.003
In the fourth match of the Tenkaichi Budokai,

00:10.219 --> 00:15.430
a battle between Great Saiyaman
and Kibito was about to begin.

00:15.641 --> 00:17.973
Become what you call Super Saiyan.

00:18.185 --> 00:22.394
I want to see if you will be of any help,
in case it comes to it.

00:22.606 --> 00:26.394
In addition, Shin, the Kaioshin,
told Goku and the others...

00:26.610 --> 00:28.851
All of you, no matter what is about to happen,

00:29.071 --> 00:31.653
| ask that you please not
move for a few moments.

00:31.865 --> 00:35.528
And then, Gohan at last made up his mind

00:35.744 --> 00:38.986
to transform to become Super Saiyan.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

00:50.801 --> 00:54.464
The minions of evil,
Yamu and Spopovitch, sprang into action,

00:54.680 --> 00:58.593
and the Tenkaichi Budokai
descended into chaos!

00:58.809 --> 01:03.644
If you do not mind, would you
all please come with me?

01:03.856 --> 01:05.437
It will be very helpful.

01:07.443 --> 01:10.105
W-What do we do, Goku?

01:10.320 --> 01:11.981
I'm going with him!

01:12.197 --> 01:15.655
I definitely wanna know
how things led up to this!

02:43.163 --> 02:47.748
"Terrifying Secret of the Majin--
The Mastermind Revealed!!"

02:55.133 --> 02:57.966
Gohan-kun, are you all right? Stay with me!

02:58.178 --> 03:00.260
Hurry up and get a stretcher ready!

03:00.472 --> 03:04.385
H-Hey, that's Videl, right? Isn't that her?

03:04.601 --> 03:06.432
It couldn't be!

03:06.645 --> 03:08.977
Is this all just a bad dream I'm having?

03:09.189 --> 03:09.974
Ow!

03:10.190 --> 03:12.272
Kuririn, what are you doing?

03:12.484 --> 03:17.023
You're going, Goku? Well, maybe I'll go, too.

03:17.239 --> 03:18.695
I'm not sure I want to, though.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.193
You go on ahead. I'm going to go tell my wife.

03:21.410 --> 03:22.900
Okay.

03:24.580 --> 03:25.945
Stop screwing around, Kakarrot!

03:26.164 --> 03:29.406
What about our showdown?
lt's after this next match!

03:29.626 --> 03:34.245
Vegeta, even so, this ain't
the time for that, is it?

03:34.464 --> 03:37.877
Don't you cheat me! I don't care
if that guy is Kaioshin or not,

03:38.093 --> 03:40.334
I don't give a damn about him!

03:40.554 --> 03:43.387
All I want to do is to settle
the score with you, one-on-one!

03:43.599 --> 03:46.386
That's the whole reason I came
to this ridiculous tournament!

03:46.602 --> 03:50.436
| get it, | get it. I really do
understand how you feel.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.262
I swear, I'll give you your match afterward,

03:52.482 --> 03:54.438
even if it ain't at the Tenkaichi Budokai.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.061
Okay? That works for you, right, Vegeta?

03:56.278 --> 03:57.028
You dirty bastard!

03:57.237 --> 03:59.523
You can only stay in this world
for one day, right?!

03:59.740 --> 04:03.483
Then you can always follow me!
We'll do it on the other side.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.192
That settles it, then. Let's go.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.913
Piccolo!

04:10.500 --> 04:13.583
You're sure it's okay for us
to leave Gohan in your hands?

04:13.795 --> 04:17.913
It's all right. Once Son Gohan has
been restored, I'm coming, too.

04:18.132 --> 04:20.966
I think Son Gohan will probably come, as well.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.794
Damn it!

04:24.848 --> 04:27.430
That guy sure as hell pisses me off!

04:31.355 --> 04:33.562
Sorry, but that's what's up.

04:33.774 --> 04:37.141
I'm not going. There's no money in it, right?

04:37.361 --> 04:41.604
Nope. Well, make sure you don't
kill anyone in the matches.

04:41.823 --> 04:42.949
Bye!

04:43.158 --> 04:44.898
If it gets dicey, get out of there!

04:45.118 --> 04:46.619
Yeah!

04:48.205 --> 04:50.992
W-Where is everyone going?

04:53.210 --> 04:54.746
You'll find out when you get there.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.704
Okay, please stand aside. We'll carry him off.

04:57.923 --> 04:59.834
Just be quiet and watch.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.792
But this man has been stabbed!

05:03.011 --> 05:05.388
W-We'll let you handle it.

05:11.103 --> 05:15.642
He's still not back to full power.
His strength is beyond measure.

05:15.857 --> 05:19.224
l have to admit, I never realized
there were any humans

05:19.444 --> 05:24.234
who had such tremendous pure energy.
No wonder they want this.

05:24.449 --> 05:28.613
What is this? What's going on?
Goten, did your brother lose?

05:28.829 --> 05:30.820
I wonder if Big Brother is all right.

05:31.039 --> 05:33.872
And our papas both flew off somewhere.

05:41.425 --> 05:43.507
That will do it, Son Gohan.

05:47.556 --> 05:50.389
Gohan-kun! You're okay, right?

05:52.269 --> 05:55.102
It feels like I've even got
more power than before.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.770
W-Who are you, mister?

05:57.983 --> 06:01.396
Come with me. I will tell you everything.

06:05.073 --> 06:08.861
Hey! Have you seen Videl?

06:09.077 --> 06:12.160
Oh, your daughter is right over there.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.490
Ah! And she's with that kid again!

06:16.710 --> 06:19.622
Damn it! I don't care if
he did heal Videl's injuries

06:19.838 --> 06:23.456
with a miraculous bean--| refuse
to accept their relationship!

06:31.725 --> 06:34.387
Say, is it okay if I come along, too?

06:34.603 --> 06:38.596
There are a lot of things
I want to know. Please?

06:38.815 --> 06:42.979
No, you'd better not.
There are sure to be dangers ahead.

06:43.195 --> 06:44.480
I can tell that much, more or less.

06:44.696 --> 06:47.984
I won't get in the way. I just want to tag along.

06:48.992 --> 06:51.233
I'm coming, even if you say no.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.285
Videl!

06:54.498 --> 06:58.161
If it gets dangerous, can you
promise me you'll get out of there?

06:58.376 --> 06:59.502
Mm-hmm.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.247
All right. Let's go.

07:01.463 --> 07:02.953
Thank you!

07:06.426 --> 07:10.886
Sh-Sh-She's flying!

07:11.098 --> 07:14.340
V-Videl is flying through the air!

07:14.559 --> 07:17.517
These past few moments,
everyone has been flying away.

07:17.729 --> 07:22.564
V-Videl, have you become
a flighty young girl now?!

07:23.568 --> 07:27.356
Wow, that pun sure is dated, huh?

07:27.572 --> 07:32.441
What's going on? Videl and
Son Gohan both flew away.

07:32.661 --> 07:35.869
This is a strange day, huh?
Videl was pummeled like crazy,

07:36.081 --> 07:37.491
and then suddenly, she's better again,

07:37.707 --> 07:39.663
and now, she's flying through the air!

07:39.876 --> 07:42.538
It's possible that this is a trick, isn't it?

07:42.754 --> 07:44.540
Like Mister Satan used to talk about?

07:44.756 --> 07:47.247
Y-Yeah, you're right. This has to be a trick.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.673
Son Gohan may be one thing,

07:48.885 --> 07:51.968
but it's unthinkable that
Videl can fly, too, right?

07:52.180 --> 07:54.171
Oh, so that's what this is.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.973
They're all in on it together,
and are pulling one big trick.

07:57.185 --> 07:59.096
It's our own fault for taking it seriously.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.304
Next time | see them at school,
I'm gonna come down on them.

08:05.110 --> 08:07.772
Goten, what's happened?

08:07.988 --> 08:09.353
Beats me.

08:09.573 --> 08:12.110
I've got a bad feelin' about this.

08:12.325 --> 08:17.194
W-W-What will become of
the Tenkaichi Budokai now?

08:22.627 --> 08:24.743
What happened to the Tenkaichi Budokai?

08:24.963 --> 08:25.748
The transmission has stopped,

08:25.964 --> 08:28.171
and they're just showing Mister Satan's face.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.284
Hey!

08:58.246 --> 09:01.158
So you came after all, did you?
That will be most helpful.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.537
It is probable that without your
assistance, we could not prevail.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.869
Couldn't prevail? Against those two?

09:07.088 --> 09:10.501
No, those two are only being exploited...

09:10.717 --> 09:12.253
...by a crafty warlock!

09:12.469 --> 09:14.005
W-Warlock?

09:14.221 --> 09:15.677
Yes. Long ago on Earth,

09:15.889 --> 09:19.882
when mankind was first starting
to walk upright on two legs,

09:20.101 --> 09:24.845
there was an evil Madoshi,
deep in outer space, named Bibidi.

09:25.065 --> 09:30.025
One day, Bibidi happened to create
an out-of-this-world monster.

09:30.237 --> 09:33.104
An unbelievably fearsome Majin,
by the name of Boo.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.735
Boo? Sounds like a whoopee cushion.

09:35.951 --> 09:38.693
Majin Boo had no sense of reason or emotion,

09:38.912 --> 09:40.868
but instead was a monster
born for the sole purpose

09:41.081 --> 09:43.413
of repeatedly causing destruction and death,

09:43.625 --> 09:46.287
and bringing terror to all living things.

09:46.503 --> 09:47.583
In just a few years,

09:47.796 --> 09:51.835
he turned hundreds of planets
into dead worlds.

10:06.523 --> 10:10.232
That sounds like something
we Saiyans would do.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.229
No, Vegeta-san.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.982
At the time, there were five Kaioshin.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.779
Each one of us had the skill to defeat

10:16.992 --> 10:19.984
the likes of a Freeza with a single blow.

10:20.203 --> 10:24.993
Of those Kaioshin, four of them
were killed by Majin Boo.

10:25.208 --> 10:27.369
Wow! Awesome!

10:27.585 --> 10:31.077
Th-That jerk! He's even able
to read minds, is he?

10:31.298 --> 10:34.586
The awfulness of Majin Boo
meant that even his creator, Bibidi,

10:34.801 --> 10:36.337
had trouble controlling him.

10:36.553 --> 10:40.216
When it became necessary to rest,
he even had to temporarily

10:40.432 --> 10:43.765
seal Majin Boo inside a ball,
rendering him immobile.

10:43.977 --> 10:48.641
Bibidi brought the sealed-up
Majin Boo here to Earth.

10:48.857 --> 10:51.849
He did this to make Earth his next target.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.276
Th-That's impossible!

10:55.488 --> 10:59.527
It was our chance.
Kaioshin was able to kill Bibidi

10:59.743 --> 11:02.450
before he could undo the seal on Majin Boo.

11:02.662 --> 11:07.656
However, the ball Majin Boo
was sealed inside was left in place.

11:07.876 --> 11:11.414
Why? You should have
destroyed it at the time.

11:11.629 --> 11:14.757
It was thought best not to provoke
the ball any more than necessary,

11:14.966 --> 11:18.333
and besides, the Madoshi Bibidi
was supposed to be the only one

11:18.553 --> 11:19.463
who could break the seal.

11:19.679 --> 11:20.634
Supposed to be?

11:20.847 --> 11:23.463
However, recently, we found out
something terrible.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.140
The Madoshi Bibidi had a child!

11:26.353 --> 11:27.138
Eh?

11:27.354 --> 11:31.814
One with the same malice as
his father--the Madoshi Babidi!

11:32.025 --> 11:33.481
Madoshi Babidi?

11:33.693 --> 11:37.857
It appears that Babidi is also able
to break the seal on Majin Boo.

11:38.073 --> 11:41.236
And he's the one who's controlling
Yamu and Spopovitch?

11:41.451 --> 11:44.943
Yes. Madoshi Babidi has
the same evil in his heart

11:45.163 --> 11:47.779
as did his father, Bibidi.

11:47.999 --> 11:49.409
Majins and Madoshis?

11:49.626 --> 11:51.617
They're a bunch of
crazy-sounding characters, huh?

11:51.836 --> 11:54.168
So in short, we have to
keep this Majin Boo guy

11:54.381 --> 11:55.746
from being brought around again?

11:55.965 --> 12:01.050
That is correct. And to do that,
we must defeat the Madoshi Babidi.

12:01.262 --> 12:04.049
Right now, the only one who can
release the seal on Majin Boo

12:04.265 --> 12:06.176
is Babidi, after all.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.429
Is this guy strong?

12:08.645 --> 12:10.601
He uses some treacherous magic,

12:10.814 --> 12:13.396
but his power as such
should be nothing too special.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.439
His father, Bibidi, was the same way.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.768
It's just that a Madoshi can take advantage

12:17.987 --> 12:19.818
of the evil in the hearts of people,

12:20.031 --> 12:23.273
like he did with Yamu and Spopovitch,
to control them.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.576
Let's just hope he is not
using any formidable people.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.551
So then, for what reason
did Spopovitch and Yamu

12:51.771 --> 12:55.514
enter the Tenkaichi Budokai?
What did they do to me?

12:55.733 --> 12:57.473
In order to bring Majin Boo back around,

12:57.694 --> 12:59.434
after being sealed up for so long,

12:59.654 --> 13:02.737
he appears to need a vast
amount of untainted energy.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.235
Untainted energy?

13:05.452 --> 13:07.534
Babidi set his sights on the Tenkaichi Budokai,

13:07.745 --> 13:10.407
where he could collect
that kind of energy in a hurry,

13:10.623 --> 13:13.365
and sent those two.

13:13.585 --> 13:18.500
Your energy, when you turned Super Saiyan,
became the supreme target.

13:18.715 --> 13:21.752
Knowing that Babidi
would do something like this,

13:21.968 --> 13:24.755
myself and Kaioshin-sama also slipped in.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.508
This is because we needed
to know where Babidi is.

13:27.724 --> 13:31.057
We have been looking around in
various ways since we came to Earth,

13:31.269 --> 13:35.888
but the ball with Majin Boo sealed
inside it was not in its old spot.

13:36.107 --> 13:37.847
He had it moved to another location.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.604
That is why we are following those two--

13:40.820 --> 13:43.197
to find out where Babidi's location is.

13:43.406 --> 13:45.192
V-Videl-san!

13:47.202 --> 13:48.237
Are you okay?

13:48.453 --> 13:50.159
Y-Yeah...

13:53.833 --> 13:55.915
If this Majin is that much bad news,

13:56.127 --> 13:58.664
how come long ago, when he
took care of Babidi's father,

13:58.880 --> 14:00.791
you just left him alone?

14:01.007 --> 14:04.625
We did not have any choice.
If we had provoked it heavy-handedly,

14:04.844 --> 14:07.426
his seal might have come undone.

14:07.639 --> 14:10.301
Besides, we were also placed at ease.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.509
The ball that had Majin Boo
sealed within it was, at the time,

14:13.728 --> 14:16.310
in a place where mankind,
who had just started walking upright,

14:16.523 --> 14:19.310
would almost certainly not be able to reach.

14:46.094 --> 14:47.379
That went well, huh?

14:47.595 --> 14:52.430
When we bring him this much energy,
Babidi-sama will be thrilled.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.808
Our reward will be huge. Let's hurry!

14:56.020 --> 14:57.521
Yeah!

15:40.565 --> 15:44.149
We won't catch up to Kaioshin-sama
and the others at this speed.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.316
We have to speed up a bit more.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.030
R-Right!

15:50.033 --> 15:52.240
Oh, just a moment, please!

15:53.703 --> 15:56.661
Videl-san, I think you'd
better not overexert yourself.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.828
I hate to admit it...

16:02.045 --> 16:04.661
...but I can't do any better than this.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.917
We're going so fast,
I can't even keep my eyes open.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.749
Videl-san, you just barely
started flying, after all.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.584
You really should go back.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.295
There's no telling what will happen up ahead.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.346
It sounds a lot more
dangerous than I imagined.

16:16.559 --> 16:18.390
Looks like I've got little choice, huh?

16:18.603 --> 16:21.219
I'd just be in the way, by any account.

16:21.439 --> 16:22.645
It's too bad, though.

16:22.857 --> 16:25.473
Thanks. Go back to the tournament grounds,

16:25.693 --> 16:28.184
and if you happen to see Goten or my mother,

16:28.404 --> 16:30.395
explain to them as best
you can what's going on.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.947
All right. But sure enough,

16:33.159 --> 16:35.821
the Golden Warrior
really was you, huh, Gohan?

16:36.996 --> 16:41.911
Mm-hmm. I'm sorry I lied to you.
I didn't want anyone to know.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.333
Seven years ago, during the fight with Cell,

16:44.545 --> 16:48.788
the odd people who were on
the site were you people, huh?

16:49.008 --> 16:52.546
And the child that was with them
was you, Gohan-kun, right?

16:52.762 --> 16:53.547
Mm-hmm.

16:53.763 --> 16:57.381
And the one who defeated Cell
probably wasn't my papa, either.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.763
--It was you guys, huh?
--W-We||, you see...

17:00.978 --> 17:02.684
I knew it.

17:02.897 --> 17:05.354
It's okay, you don't have to
spare my feelings like that.

17:05.566 --> 17:10.105
I thought it was a bit strange
that Papa defeated him, myself.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.107
This is a load off.

17:12.323 --> 17:15.486
Good luck, Gohan-kun!
You go defeat this Madoshi Babidi guy,

17:15.702 --> 17:16.907
and save all of us.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.609
Mm-hmm.

17:22.040 --> 17:26.000
Gohan-kun! I'll be waiting
at the tournament grounds!

17:26.212 --> 17:26.997
Right!

17:27.213 --> 17:28.248
Are you finished?

17:28.464 --> 17:30.079
Yes, sorry about that.

17:30.299 --> 17:33.883
Then let's speed up, and catch up
to Kaioshin-sama and the others!

17:34.095 --> 17:35.585
Right!

17:38.891 --> 17:41.268
W-What speed!

17:48.317 --> 17:50.649
Don't get killed, okay, Gohan-kun?

17:50.862 --> 17:54.195
Once you come back safely,
I'd like us to date, and stuff.

18:15.845 --> 18:17.426
Ah! We caught up!

18:17.638 --> 18:19.503
Father!

18:19.724 --> 18:21.009
Ah, it's Gohan!

18:21.225 --> 18:23.261
Yeah, hurry on over here!

18:28.316 --> 18:29.476
Gohan, we've been waiting.

18:29.692 --> 18:30.477
Right!

18:30.693 --> 18:35.608
Did you hear? Our enemy this time
sounds outrageously nasty.

18:35.823 --> 18:36.608
Yes.

18:36.824 --> 18:39.406
Okay, after all these years,
let's go tear it up some!

18:39.619 --> 18:40.404
Yes, let's do.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.783
Goku is all revved up for this,
but are we really okay?

18:43.998 --> 18:46.034
This sounds like a real hornet's nest.

19:02.308 --> 19:03.809
Here they come.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.144
That's it, down there.

19:14.904 --> 19:17.020
Oh, they're starting to land!

19:18.533 --> 19:19.648
Out here?

19:19.867 --> 19:24.076
This is strange. I know we
searched this area before.

19:43.474 --> 19:47.217
Everyone, please mask
your presences. Understood?

19:49.522 --> 19:51.058
Someone's down there!

19:52.525 --> 19:54.356
Is he that Babidi guy?

19:54.569 --> 19:58.983
No, he is not. He must be
one of Babidi's henchmen.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.190
Hey, the ground around the area
down there looks strange.

20:02.410 --> 20:03.695
Kind of like it's been dug up.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.876
That's why we didn't notice it
while we were searching.

20:11.085 --> 20:14.998
Which would also mean
that Babidi may already know

20:15.214 --> 20:17.796
that we are here on Earth.

20:18.009 --> 20:20.295
Otherwise, he would not hide his ship.

20:20.511 --> 20:24.424
We should hurry up and launch our attack!
Before they use the energy

20:24.640 --> 20:27.097
they stole from Gohan to revive Majin Boo!

20:27.310 --> 20:31.394
It is all right. Majin Boo's revival
will take place outside

20:31.606 --> 20:33.221
so that the spaceship does not get destroyed.

20:33.441 --> 20:36.808
Let's wait and watch a little longer,
until that moment.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.579
Someone is coming out!

21:21.572 --> 21:25.406
Kaioshin and the others
endeavor to prevent the revival

21:25.618 --> 21:29.531
of Majin Boo and all of his tremendous power.

21:29.747 --> 21:34.411
Who are these two mysterious figures
who have shown themselves?

22:41.777 --> 22:43.563
Heya! l'm Goku!

22:43.779 --> 22:48.364
So that's Babidi, the guy who's
trying to revive Majin Boo?

22:48.576 --> 22:51.488
Hmm? Who's that guy next to him?

22:52.747 --> 22:56.365
D-Don't tell me he has that man in his service!

22:56.584 --> 22:58.324
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:58.544 --> 23:03.334
"The Nefarious Madoshi Babidi and King of
the Demon Realm of Darkness Dabra's Trap."

23:03.549 --> 23:05.756
Be careful! He's coming this way!
