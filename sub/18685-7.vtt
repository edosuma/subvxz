WEBVTT

00:01.602 --> 00:03.504
*

00:05.373 --> 00:07.708
Is he normally
this sweaty?

00:07.741 --> 00:09.877
I don't think
it's normal for anyone

00:09.910 --> 00:11.245
to be this sweaty.
Hmm.

00:11.279 --> 00:13.247
Ah.

00:13.281 --> 00:14.848
Okay.

00:14.882 --> 00:16.917
First off,
I had zero knowledge

00:16.950 --> 00:18.886
of what was going on
with your parents' finances.

00:18.919 --> 00:19.987
Aren't you their money manager?

00:20.020 --> 00:21.089
I know, right?
I mean,

00:21.122 --> 00:22.823
it doesn't feel great
to be left out.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.024
It didn't help
that I found out

00:24.058 --> 00:26.894
about the fiasco
from the NY Insider column

00:26.927 --> 00:27.895
at my
therapist's office.

00:27.928 --> 00:29.530
(gasps)
What?

00:29.563 --> 00:32.166
Oliver Fishburn did
a piece on Mom and Dad?

00:32.200 --> 00:33.567
Who's Oliver Fishburn?

00:33.601 --> 00:36.036
He's only the biggest
gossip columnist in New York.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.738
The man feasts on the elite.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.873
If I were you, I would
take this opportunity

00:39.907 --> 00:43.277
to lay low and cut back
on unnecessary expenses.

00:43.311 --> 00:44.578
You know what we should do?
We should march straight

00:44.612 --> 00:45.913
to the club and confront him.

00:45.946 --> 00:48.116
I mean, he basically uses
that place as his office.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.017
That's the opposite
of what I just suggested.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.019
Uh, look, if I were you, I would

00:52.052 --> 00:53.721
cancel the country club
membership

00:53.754 --> 00:55.756
until we know
the state of your finances.

00:55.789 --> 00:58.226
Don't be a moron, Barry. We're
not canceling the country club.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.694
And why didn't anyone tell me
we have a country club?

01:00.728 --> 01:03.397
You don't have
a country club. We do.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.032
If anything, we should be
spending more time there

01:05.065 --> 01:07.368
so that everybody can see
that the Pembertons are fine.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.537
Yeah, yeah, we're fine.
Not you.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.272
Yeah. If I don't play in the
golf tournament this weekend,

01:11.305 --> 01:13.307
people are gonna know
something's up.

01:13.341 --> 01:15.943
People are gonna notice if a
13-year-old isn't playing golf?

01:15.976 --> 01:19.079
Yeah. It's basically
the social hub of Greenwich.

01:19.113 --> 01:22.550
Remember when the Ostrovskys got
caught up in that Ponzi scheme?

01:22.583 --> 01:23.951
It's all anybody
could talk about.

01:23.984 --> 01:26.420
Former clients
who also ignored my advice.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.756
Oh, remember that one time
you pooped in the pool

01:28.789 --> 01:30.958
and everyone called you
Sabrina Pooperton?

01:30.991 --> 01:31.959
Shut up, Chip.
Back up.

01:31.992 --> 01:33.227
Sabrina pooped the pool?

01:33.261 --> 01:34.728
No. When I was nine,
I ate some chocolate

01:34.762 --> 01:37.064
in the pool
and everybody went crazy.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.966
Oh.
People are idiots.

01:38.999 --> 01:40.801
Eh, mom and dad had to pay
for the drainage fee.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.336
That's basically
admission of guilt.

01:42.370 --> 01:45.072
Yeah.
Guys, I can't
make this any clearer:

01:45.105 --> 01:47.241
this is a bad idea.

01:47.275 --> 01:48.809
Barry, you've been overruled.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.611
Now, let's talk about the food
situation at this club.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.513
Do they do a decent nacho?

01:52.546 --> 01:54.815
I don't mean
to offend you...

01:54.848 --> 01:56.250
Then don't.

01:56.284 --> 01:58.085
You don't fit
the Pemberton brand.

01:58.118 --> 02:01.522
The Pemberton brand seems to
be fugitives and pool poopers.

02:05.559 --> 02:08.496
Hey, pop these
by the first tee for me.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.631
Thanks, chief.
What...

02:10.664 --> 02:12.266
what are you doing?
Chip.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.667
Show some restraint.

02:13.701 --> 02:16.003
I am.
Dad usually gives him 50.

02:16.036 --> 02:17.705
Well, maybe consider
a new financial role model

02:17.738 --> 02:19.273
besides Dad.

02:19.307 --> 02:21.041
What the hell?

02:21.074 --> 02:23.143
I'm not in my usual foursome
with Judge Golder.

02:23.177 --> 02:24.512
(gasps)
There you are.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.380
Oh, you're with
Jerry Berlin.

02:26.414 --> 02:28.282
Oh, the guy from the
concrete company?

02:28.316 --> 02:30.951
It's already happening-- we're
becoming socially radioactive.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.553
(laughs)
Oh, here he comes.

02:32.586 --> 02:33.787
Is that Chippy?
How are you?

02:33.821 --> 02:34.988
How you doing, darling?
(exclaims weakly)

02:35.022 --> 02:37.291
You ready to go make this course
our 18-hole bitch?

02:37.325 --> 02:39.293
I would, and I'd love
to, but me and Sabrina

02:39.327 --> 02:40.528
have to go to the...
No, we don't.

02:40.561 --> 02:41.962
Have fun.
Yeah?

02:41.995 --> 02:44.131
Yeah? Come on, tiger.
Huh? Come on.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.966
All right,
let's go, come on.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.835
I said, "Sweetie, sleeping
with a woman doesn't

02:47.868 --> 02:51.038
make you a lesbian,
it means you're bored."

02:51.071 --> 02:52.573
I know. Right?

02:52.606 --> 02:53.574
100%.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.676
Oh, God.
I'll call you back.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.311
Hey, Oliver.
Sabrina Pemberton.

02:57.345 --> 02:58.579
We met at the Met Gala.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.548
I'm sorry, that night
is a blur of bad Pinot

03:00.581 --> 03:02.316
and intolerable conversation.

03:02.350 --> 03:04.084
I assume you want to
talk about the article?

03:04.117 --> 03:06.153
Oh, that stupid thing?
No. Come on. (chuckles)

03:06.186 --> 03:08.656
I just came over here to
tell you how big of a fan I am.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.857
Aw, sweet.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.158
Thanks for popping by.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.227
No, I just also wanted
to say that, you know,

03:13.261 --> 03:14.495
if you ever needed a resource,

03:14.528 --> 03:16.063
I'm pretty plugged in
around here.

03:16.096 --> 03:17.898
Oh, are you?

03:17.931 --> 03:19.700
I mean,

03:19.733 --> 03:22.403
in my eyeline alone...

03:22.436 --> 03:24.071
Dan Gregor

03:24.104 --> 03:25.706
flipped his car
with a hooker in the front

03:25.739 --> 03:27.074
and an eight ball
in the glove box.

03:27.107 --> 03:28.442
Hmm.

03:28.476 --> 03:29.543
That's it?

03:29.577 --> 03:30.878
I'm just getting started.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.713
Huh.
Jackie Gilford

03:32.746 --> 03:33.714
had her housekeeper deported

03:33.747 --> 03:35.449
because she didn't want
to fire her.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.551
Oh, and Caroline Martin--

03:37.585 --> 03:40.354
she used all the money
from her 9/11 charity fund

03:40.388 --> 03:41.622
to fix that face.

03:41.655 --> 03:42.856
(exclaims softly)
And not that

03:42.890 --> 03:44.191
it's worthy of an article,

03:44.224 --> 03:47.395
but that purebred Goldendoodle
she won't shut up about?

03:47.428 --> 03:49.029
(whispers):
Rescue.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.564
(laughs)

03:50.598 --> 03:52.433
Yeah. So, you know,

03:52.466 --> 03:55.102
as you can see, there are
plenty of stories here

03:55.135 --> 03:56.937
that are far juicier
than my family.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.907
(chuckles)
Girl, you are the story.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.042
(chuckles)
What?
Prominent family

04:02.075 --> 04:03.711
on the brink of collapse
with a daughter

04:03.744 --> 04:05.746
who's got a mouth
like a fire hose?

04:05.779 --> 04:07.214
Wait, I told you that
in confidence.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.549
Ah, you didn't say
"off the record."

04:08.582 --> 04:09.383
Off the record.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.217
Nah.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.652
Okay. I made it all up.

04:11.685 --> 04:12.653
So...

04:12.686 --> 04:14.087
Oh. So you're a liar, too?

04:14.121 --> 04:15.222
What?
Oh! This keeps

04:15.255 --> 04:16.890
getting better and better.
No...

04:16.924 --> 04:18.292
Oh, God!

04:19.327 --> 04:20.894
Oh, God.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.896
Look, all I'm saying is that,
for a fancy establishment,

04:22.930 --> 04:25.098
you do very
piss-poor nachos.

04:25.132 --> 04:26.266
Ma'am, we don't do nachos.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.768
You insisted we make them.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.937
Yeah. Well, you tried, and
you did a really bad job of it.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.138
So I'm not paying for them.

04:31.171 --> 04:32.673
Well, don't
take 'em away.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.141
I'm gonna snack
around a little bit.

04:34.174 --> 04:35.409
I will take another mojito.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.144
You seem to have
a pretty good handle on those.

04:37.177 --> 04:38.912
Thank you. Ah!

04:38.946 --> 04:41.148
One for my girl, too.
Oh, no, no, no. No, no.

04:41.181 --> 04:42.750
Poodle says that
when I'm at the club,

04:42.783 --> 04:44.418
I'm supposed to be invisible.

04:44.452 --> 04:46.620
Alba, when you get a chance
to party at a place like this,

04:46.654 --> 04:47.755
you got to take full advantage.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.590
Oh.
Check out all this stuff

04:49.623 --> 04:52.125
that I snagged.
All for free.
Oh.

04:52.159 --> 04:54.428
Stole this massaging showerhead.
Just unscrewed it,

04:54.462 --> 04:56.330
right off the shower.
Nice, right?
That's nice.

04:56.364 --> 04:57.698
Yeah.
You get the little soaps?

04:57.731 --> 04:58.799
I really like
those little soaps.
You kidding me?

04:58.832 --> 04:59.967
I got a hundred little s...
What the hell

05:00.000 --> 05:00.934
are you doing here?

05:00.968 --> 05:02.603
Oh, yeah, you know what,

05:02.636 --> 05:05.973
I was sitting at home, and then
I remembered you're not my boss.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.808
Place is amazing, by
the way. You're right.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.177
Yeah, well, enjoy it, because
it might be our last day.

05:10.210 --> 05:12.713
What are you talking about,
last day?
Alba,

05:12.746 --> 05:14.214
will you please take Ben
to the playroom?

05:14.247 --> 05:15.716
I need to have a chat
with Mickey.

05:15.749 --> 05:19.119
Well, if you're gonna use bad
words, I already know five.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.188
The B-word you
always call Mickey...

05:21.221 --> 05:22.990
Okay, let's go. Come on.
You like to play.
Wait, I'm not done,

05:23.023 --> 05:25.793
I'm not done. (sighs)
No, no, no, no, no.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.829
Hmm. Was the "B"
for "boisterous"?

05:31.865 --> 05:33.834
What's the matter?
Little plan didn't work?

05:33.867 --> 05:36.637
Not exactly. I think
I poured more gas on the fire.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.906
Oh, hell no. Mm-mm.
I got a tennis lesson tomorrow.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.475
Lead me to him.
I'll handle this clown.

05:41.509 --> 05:42.576
Okay.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.181
Pem-ba-tone.
Pem-ba-ton.

05:48.215 --> 05:49.483
Pemberton.

05:49.517 --> 05:50.484
Peh-ba-tone.

05:50.518 --> 05:51.852
Pa-ba-tone.
Pemberton.

05:51.885 --> 05:52.986
Pem-ba-ten.
Pemberton.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.555
BOTH: Pem-ba...
Okay, you know what,

05:54.588 --> 05:56.490
screw it, all right?
Where's our carts?
Oh, it's the last team

05:56.524 --> 05:58.759
of the day.
No carts left.

05:58.792 --> 06:02.029
(exhales) Fine. I'll get some
waters. We'll be on our way.

06:02.062 --> 06:05.766
Oh, yeah, we ran
out of those, too.

06:05.799 --> 06:08.536
Don't you guys see
what's happening?

06:09.970 --> 06:11.338
We're getting boxed out!
Aw,

06:11.371 --> 06:13.173
relax, kid. Happens
all the time.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.043
Not to me, it doesn't.
It's a slap in the face.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.912
Fine. All right. We'll see
how easy it is for them

06:18.946 --> 06:20.781
to box us out once
we go out there and win

06:20.814 --> 06:22.883
the whole damn tournament!
Who's with me?

06:22.916 --> 06:24.051
ALL:
Hai!

06:24.084 --> 06:25.185
Yeah, yeah, I'm revved up.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.520
Yeah!
Let's do this.

06:26.554 --> 06:27.588
Come on.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.256
* All right

06:29.289 --> 06:31.792
*

06:33.727 --> 06:36.029
(exhales)
Oh. Shanked it.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.065
Seriously?

06:38.098 --> 06:40.367
(piano playing)

06:40.400 --> 06:42.235
Can I help you?

06:42.269 --> 06:44.371
No, I don't think so.
But I can help you.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.907
My name's Mickey.
I'm Sabrina Pemberton's aunt.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.909
Oh, of course. Poodle's sister.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.545
I smell the resemblance.
Is that rum?

06:51.579 --> 06:53.313
Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's rum.
Good nose.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.649
Listen, I know you're
a busy girl and I'm a busy guy,

06:55.683 --> 06:57.751
so I'll just get right down
to business.

06:58.752 --> 06:59.620
Boom.

06:59.653 --> 07:00.754
What is this?

07:00.788 --> 07:04.091
That's $168.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.460
And what am I supposed to do
with it?

07:06.494 --> 07:07.995
I don't care. Put a down payment
on a Chihuahua.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.096
It's a bribe. Take it.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.932
Huh.

07:11.965 --> 07:15.469
(grunts)
There. That's better.

07:15.503 --> 07:17.404
Is there a problem?

07:17.437 --> 07:18.405
No. None whatsoever.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.074
Thanks to $168 and your niece,

07:21.108 --> 07:23.944
I'm flush with material
for the next month.

07:24.978 --> 07:27.414
(chuckles softly)

07:27.447 --> 07:28.749
Okay.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.951
Well, I hope
you've got a good memory.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.390
That wasn't mine.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.660
What's that?

07:39.693 --> 07:40.761
That wasn't mine.

07:40.794 --> 07:41.595
Mm. Mm.

07:41.629 --> 07:43.263
Watch that.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.298
Keep your eyes on that.
Walk away.

07:46.634 --> 07:49.937
Concentrate.
Eye on the ball.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.673
Deep breath.
Nice and easy.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.141
Own it, baby!
G...

07:54.174 --> 07:55.509
Ooh!

07:55.543 --> 07:56.777
Ah. Worm burner.

07:56.810 --> 07:57.878
Damn it!

07:57.911 --> 07:59.446
Easy, buddy.
Stupid...

07:59.479 --> 08:00.781
You okay, tiger?

08:00.814 --> 08:01.682
I'm fine!

08:01.715 --> 08:02.616
You sure?

08:02.650 --> 08:04.618
I'm freaking fine!
Listen,

08:04.652 --> 08:06.186
I heard about your folks,
all right?

08:06.219 --> 08:07.821
Everybody
gets popped

08:07.855 --> 08:10.057
sooner or later.
They'll get through it.
All right, well,

08:10.090 --> 08:13.594
we're not everybody.
Our name is getting stomped on!

08:14.862 --> 08:17.364
I thought if we came here

08:17.397 --> 08:19.199
and won the tournament,

08:19.232 --> 08:22.636
I could've got some
of our glory back.
Mm. I get it.

08:22.670 --> 08:25.138
Look, all you got to do
is change the conversation.

08:25.172 --> 08:28.141
Okay. So how do I, um...

08:28.175 --> 08:30.010
how do I change
the conversation?

08:30.043 --> 08:31.478
Hmm. Well,
you could tell everybody

08:31.511 --> 08:33.480
you tackled
a school shooter.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.349
Okay. That could be nice.
Nah, nah.
You know what,

08:36.383 --> 08:37.851
an injury is always
the safest bet.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.486
You take a line drive
to the sternum right now,

08:39.519 --> 08:40.721
that's all
they'll remember.

08:40.754 --> 08:43.023
Tax fraud who? Murder what?

08:43.056 --> 08:44.992
My family didn't murder anybody.

08:45.025 --> 08:48.228
I'm not asking any questions.
I'm thinking about the kid
with the hole in his chest.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.499
Fine. Do it.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.366
Good man.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.334
*

08:54.367 --> 08:56.503
All right.
Now, I want you

08:56.536 --> 08:58.505
to cover your teeth
and your junk.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.740
Okay.
All right?

08:59.773 --> 09:01.374
Okay.
Cover up.

09:01.408 --> 09:02.509
Here it comes.
All right.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.511
All right.
Only take a second.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.846
(groans)
Won't hurt.

09:05.879 --> 09:06.947
Won't hurt. Here comes. Ready?

09:06.980 --> 09:09.182
(muffled shouting)

09:09.216 --> 09:10.217
Oh!

09:10.250 --> 09:11.852
(chuckles)

09:11.885 --> 09:14.054
What the hell is wrong
with you?!
Come on.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.056
Stop.
Let me buy you an Arnie Palmer,
all right?

09:16.089 --> 09:18.525
Rest his soul. Come on.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.193
I got it.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.395
We chuck hot sauce
in his face.

09:22.429 --> 09:23.563
What's that gonna do?

09:23.597 --> 09:25.398
It's gonna burn him really bad.

09:25.432 --> 09:27.534
Oh, God. You're an idiot.
I'm the idiot?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.569
At least I'm, like, coming up
with stuff here, you know?

09:29.603 --> 09:31.538
Oh, God. I really think
you should slow down.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.572
You're gonna crap yourself.

09:32.606 --> 09:33.907
That's kind of your department.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.943
(grunts)

09:40.914 --> 09:41.915
Huh?

09:41.949 --> 09:44.384
No.
Are you kidding me?

09:44.417 --> 09:46.553
Think about it. We need
something that will overshadow

09:46.586 --> 09:48.055
your family's scandal, right?

09:48.088 --> 09:49.422
We can't.

09:49.456 --> 09:50.758
Oh, we can.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.726
And we will.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.896
We're gonna make Oliver
poop the pool.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.765
Just like you did.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.800
Um...

10:05.272 --> 10:06.506
JERRY:
Ugh. Dead last.

10:06.539 --> 10:07.641
Who would've guessed it?

10:07.675 --> 10:08.742
Literally, anyone.

10:08.776 --> 10:10.177
Yeah, well,
that's the thing about golf.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.611
You know-- ooh.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.747
Hey, have you guys
seen Ben? Yeah.
Yeah, we need his poop.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.315
Wow.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.250
You gonna introduce me
to your friend?

10:17.284 --> 10:18.852
(scoffs) Jerry, Mickey.
Mickey, Jerry.

10:18.886 --> 10:21.588
How are you, blue eyes?
Can I buy you a drink?

10:21.621 --> 10:22.790
Yeah.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.225
Mm-hmm.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.763
Oh, my goodness.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.264
That's a woman.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.599
Hey, hey.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.868
If it isn't the all-stars.

10:34.902 --> 10:35.969
(men laugh)

10:36.003 --> 10:37.270
What happened
out there today, Chip?

10:37.304 --> 10:39.606
Guess your short game fled
the country, too, hey, kiddo?

10:39.639 --> 10:40.774
(men laugh)

10:40.808 --> 10:42.275
Oh, yeah?

10:42.309 --> 10:43.944
Well, get this.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.779
While you good old boys
were busy chuggin' high balls,

10:45.813 --> 10:48.281
Pemberton here
sunk a hole in one.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.117
Really?
Oh, yeah.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.952
That's incredible.
Hey, guys.
Yeah.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.621
The Pemberton kid here
got a hole in one.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.622
(all cheer and clap)

10:55.655 --> 10:57.858
That's my boy, huh?
(laughs)

10:57.891 --> 11:00.627
Yeah, I, uh, I can't believe
you told them that.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.863
Oh, and I can't believe
I was there to see it.

11:02.896 --> 11:05.265
Tell them, Chip.
Take it away.

11:06.399 --> 11:07.567
Y-Yeah.

11:07.600 --> 11:12.305
So, I was, um...
golfing with this guy

11:12.339 --> 11:14.241
and, uh, we were
on the grass

11:14.274 --> 11:16.977
and I reached for my seven iron
and then I switched to a six,

11:17.010 --> 11:17.978
'cause, well, I'm 13.

11:18.011 --> 11:18.979
He's 13!

11:19.012 --> 11:19.980
(laughter)

11:20.013 --> 11:21.648
(chuckles)

11:21.681 --> 11:24.651
You're killing them.
Go ahead, tell them.
Yeah.

11:24.684 --> 11:25.886
So, I, uh, I inhale

11:25.919 --> 11:28.055
some fresh morning air.
Uh-huh.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.990
And-and then I take
a nice swing back

11:30.023 --> 11:32.425
and I rip it, right?

11:32.459 --> 11:33.827
And I thought I overshot it,
I really did,

11:33.861 --> 11:35.896
but it turns out
I hit it right on the pin

11:35.929 --> 11:37.430
and it rolled right in.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.733
(laughs)
A round of drinks on Pemberton.

11:39.767 --> 11:40.868
(cheering and laughter)

11:44.571 --> 11:45.538
Wait, wait, wait, what?

11:45.572 --> 11:46.539
It's tradition.

11:46.573 --> 11:47.941
You get a hole in one,

11:47.975 --> 11:49.209
buy drinks for the whole club.

11:49.242 --> 11:50.543
(whispering):
Hey.

11:50.577 --> 11:51.678
What the hell, Jerry?

11:51.711 --> 11:53.480
I can't afford to pay
for the whole damn club.

11:54.982 --> 11:58.451
(sighs)
Know what? Screw it.

11:58.485 --> 12:01.421
Drink up, you sons of bitches,
it's on the Pembertons!
Pemberton.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.256
(cheering)

12:03.290 --> 12:05.558
Mmm.
(slurps)

12:05.592 --> 12:07.460
Mmm.

12:07.494 --> 12:10.864
What do you think, Benito?
What should we do next?

12:10.898 --> 12:13.433
You want 'em to wrap us
in the detoxifying seaweed

12:13.466 --> 12:16.236
or scrub us down
with the pineapple enzymes?

12:16.269 --> 12:17.237
(slurps)

12:17.270 --> 12:19.639
I want the pineapple
enzyme scrub

12:19.672 --> 12:21.641
and the detoxifying seaweed.

12:21.674 --> 12:22.642
Mmm.

12:22.675 --> 12:24.244
You heard him.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.813
Pineapple
the son of a bitch.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.714
Oh, and put it on
the Pemberton account.

12:27.747 --> 12:28.715
Alba, what are you doing?

12:28.748 --> 12:29.883
Do you have any idea how
much this costs?

12:29.917 --> 12:31.885
That a mojito?
Yeah, it is.

12:31.919 --> 12:32.986
That's my girl.
(Alba chuckles)

12:33.020 --> 12:34.754
(chuckles)
Aunt Mickey,

12:34.788 --> 12:37.224
I'm gonna get
covered in mud.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.992
No kidding, we were looking
to do some mud stuff, too.

12:39.026 --> 12:40.393
Yeah, and I just want
to go on record

12:40.427 --> 12:41.795
and say this was not my idea.

12:41.829 --> 12:44.264
Right, yeah, yeah, this was
totally not her idea. Yeah.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.666
It was, however, based on
the story of her life.

12:46.699 --> 12:47.734
(chuckles)

12:47.767 --> 12:48.735
Ben, what do you say?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.237
You want to do
our family a solid?

12:50.270 --> 12:51.671
Uh, okay.

12:51.704 --> 12:54.241
But can I go to
the bathroom first?

12:54.274 --> 12:57.077
Bingo.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.512
And so finally,
the Jew says to the Mormon,

12:59.546 --> 13:01.248
"Because it's my bank."

13:01.281 --> 13:03.150
(laughter)

13:03.183 --> 13:05.518
Ooh.

13:05.552 --> 13:06.753
What about our boy, huh?

13:06.786 --> 13:08.688
Oh, he's great.
You should've been there.

13:08.721 --> 13:10.090
Yeah, well, they're here now
and we're talking

13:10.123 --> 13:11.591
and you're interrupting.

13:11.624 --> 13:12.592
Oh.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.161
Oh, I get it.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.295
Do you?

13:15.328 --> 13:16.964
Because you're still
here, all right?

13:16.997 --> 13:18.265
So, how about you go
enjoy your free drink

13:18.298 --> 13:19.867
and if we need any
fun facts about gravel,

13:19.900 --> 13:21.334
we'll hit you up,
all right?

13:21.368 --> 13:22.435
(laughter)

13:22.469 --> 13:24.938
(forced chuckle)
All right.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.273
(fake chuckle)

13:26.306 --> 13:28.608
Pardon me, Chip,
may I have a word?

13:28.641 --> 13:29.609
Yeah, sure, Alfie.

13:29.642 --> 13:33.046
One second, boys.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.514
So, what is this about?

13:34.547 --> 13:36.383
A photo op with
the hole-in-one kid?

13:36.416 --> 13:39.486
Well, it's come to my
attention that you may have

13:39.519 --> 13:41.021
embellished your story.

13:41.054 --> 13:43.656
*

13:46.693 --> 13:47.660
(slurps)

13:47.694 --> 13:48.728
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:48.761 --> 13:51.899
So, we are gonna
put Ben's poop

13:51.932 --> 13:55.468
(slurring): inside
this gossip columnist?

13:55.502 --> 13:58.305
No. And cool it on the drinks
while I explain the plan.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.141
(loud, sustained slurp)

14:01.174 --> 14:03.243
Go on.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.178
This is gone.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.846
*

14:06.880 --> 14:08.815
Thanks to Sabrina's
cunning and charm,

14:08.848 --> 14:11.251
we know that Oliver goes to
the pool every day after lunch

14:11.284 --> 14:15.588
to work on his tan.

14:15.622 --> 14:18.325
And once our little songbird
finds his perfect perch,

14:18.358 --> 14:21.828
we kick off a tanning day
from hell.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.664
First, we swap out his tanning
oil for cooking grease

14:24.697 --> 14:26.699
so he bakes
like a human brisket.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.337
Ah.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.173
Then, Alba utilizes
her nanny network

14:33.206 --> 14:36.176
to ensure some serious
stink sours his mood.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.844
I know all the babies.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.346
I know you do.
Mm.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.714
Oh, my God.
What are you feeding that thing?

14:41.748 --> 14:44.851
MICKEY: Then Ben will
delicately distract him.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.519
(grunt)
Who the hell did that?

14:46.553 --> 14:47.787
Sorry, mister.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.056
MICKEY:
While I approach

14:49.089 --> 14:50.857
with a not so fresh towel.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.892
No one's unclear
on the poop part.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.727
No toys by the pool.

14:55.495 --> 14:56.463
Okay.

14:56.496 --> 14:57.864
Want to play
Marco Polo?

14:57.897 --> 14:58.898
Get out of here.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.034
MICKEY:
And then...

15:01.068 --> 15:03.403
the coup de grâce.

15:03.436 --> 15:06.106
The most precise and
intricate part of our plan.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.042
(baby crying)
Between the heat,

15:09.076 --> 15:10.543
the smell,
and the crying,

15:10.577 --> 15:11.544
Oliver's left
with only one option.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.912
Really?

15:12.946 --> 15:13.913
This now?

15:13.947 --> 15:15.048
Ugh.

15:15.082 --> 15:17.951
MICKEY:
Get in that pool.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.053
BEN:
Oh, my God!

15:20.087 --> 15:22.489
Is that poop?

15:22.522 --> 15:23.823
What?

15:23.856 --> 15:25.425
No! What?
(kids laughing)

15:27.360 --> 15:29.229
No, you're mistaken!

15:29.262 --> 15:30.230
It can't be.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.798
That's not what that is.

15:31.831 --> 15:33.100
MICKEY:
And just like that,

15:33.133 --> 15:35.402
he becomes the pariah
he tried to make us,

15:35.435 --> 15:39.406
the poop pariah.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.408
Oh, yeah.
Let's do that.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.509
Yeah.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.077
Aunt Mickey,
I really got to go.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.412
Oh, right, right, right.
Yeah. Let's roll.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.848
Why'd you stop?
Mmm.

15:54.487 --> 15:59.259
Can you guys please stop
making eye contact with me?

15:59.292 --> 16:00.427
Well, I just
don't understand

16:00.460 --> 16:01.928
why you're having
such a hard time.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.963
I mean, you're normally like
one of those Play-Doh presses.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.265
Yeah, hurry it up.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.499
This is getting
really weird.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.301
ALBA: Don't worry,
it's taken care of.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.203
Ah!
It's not that,

16:10.237 --> 16:11.771
I stole some fudge
from the kitchen.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.306
Oh.
See?

16:13.340 --> 16:16.009
It does look the same.
All right.
Chill out, Pooperton.

16:16.043 --> 16:17.010
No!

16:17.044 --> 16:18.745
(speaking Japanese)

16:21.881 --> 16:23.283
They're lying!

16:23.316 --> 16:25.318
We don't take these
accusations lightly.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.155
Fortunately, the last member of
your foursome can clear this up.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.456
JERRY:
Oh.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.525
Chippy, Chippy, Chippy,
Chip, Chip.

16:32.559 --> 16:35.295
My line of work,
we have a saying.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.896
Truth is
the best foundation.

16:36.929 --> 16:39.132
The most concrete thing we have.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.000
Jerry, please.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.070
To cheat in golf,
the purest of all games,

16:43.103 --> 16:45.472
why, that could tarnish
your reputation.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.174
I don't see how a man
could ever recover,

16:47.207 --> 16:48.808
not in this country.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.144
Well, you might be able to get
a fresh start overseas.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.313
Well, I don't know.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.981
But I don't actually think

16:55.014 --> 16:58.485
my Pacific Rim friends here
have accused anyone of anything.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.420
They're just confused.

17:00.453 --> 17:04.591
(speaks Japanese)

17:06.393 --> 17:08.595
Ah.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.363
Hole in one.
Hmm.
Hai.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.399
Hai. Hai.
Oh, hai.
Hai!

17:12.432 --> 17:13.500
JERRY:
Hai.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.768
I did the Olympic village
in Nagano Games '98.

17:15.802 --> 17:18.338
Seems to me,
we owe this boy an apology.

17:18.371 --> 17:21.341
Chip, I feel like
I owe you...
(Jerry clears throat)

17:21.374 --> 17:23.042
Mr. Pemberton.
Huh?

17:23.076 --> 17:24.711
Mr. Pemberton, Pemberton.
(clicks tongue)

17:24.744 --> 17:26.279
Right.
Mr. Pemberton,

17:26.313 --> 17:30.049
I hope that you accept
our sincerest apology.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.918
Alfie, Alfie.
Save it, all right?

17:31.951 --> 17:32.952
These things happen.

17:32.985 --> 17:34.187
Thank you.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.688
If you're a moron!

17:35.722 --> 17:36.956
You slander me?

17:36.989 --> 17:38.958
Me?! And you think
you'll get away with it?

17:38.991 --> 17:40.527
I'll have my lawyers
all over your ass,

17:40.560 --> 17:41.794
and by the time
they're done with you,

17:41.828 --> 17:43.563
my name will be
all over this club,

17:43.596 --> 17:46.065
while you're outside mowing
the lawn, you animal!

17:46.099 --> 17:48.067
I don't know
what to say.

17:48.101 --> 17:49.636
CHIP: Say nothing!
Shut your pie hole!

17:49.669 --> 17:50.770
You ought to know bet...

17:50.803 --> 17:53.206
Ah, well, you got
a scary side, kid.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.142
(soft chuckle)
Thanks.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.576
Why'd you help me out?

17:56.609 --> 17:58.044
Ah.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.047
Kid, my old man was a
shoeshine boy for coal miners.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.249
I was born in the dust.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.717
Makes me feel good to be
in a position to help out

18:04.751 --> 18:06.319
a little prince
like yourself.

18:06.353 --> 18:09.889
A Berlin bailing out
a Pemberton, how about that?

18:09.922 --> 18:11.758
Well, thank you.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.260
Don't mention it.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.562
Just get me your aunt's phone
number, we'll be even, huh?

18:15.595 --> 18:16.896
Done.

18:16.929 --> 18:22.169
And here he comes
in three, two...

18:22.202 --> 18:24.571
*

18:24.604 --> 18:29.942
And he will be walking through
that door in three, two...

18:29.976 --> 18:32.011
one. Where is he?
Ugh.

18:32.044 --> 18:33.913
Where is he?
Oh, no.

18:33.946 --> 18:34.914
He's over there.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.516
MICKEY:
Are you serious?

18:36.549 --> 18:37.817
So much for
the master plan.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.786
All right, well, where's Alba?
She's got the stuff.

18:39.819 --> 18:40.953
Oh, yeah, there she is.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.090
Alba!

18:44.123 --> 18:45.225
Screw it.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.468
Hey, Fishburn.

18:55.502 --> 18:56.569
(screams)

18:57.804 --> 18:59.071
(kids laughing)

19:02.409 --> 19:04.777
Sabrina, is that-- oh.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.145
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.380
Sabrina Pemberton
pooped the pool.

19:07.414 --> 19:08.381
What?

19:08.415 --> 19:09.816
(laughter)

19:09.849 --> 19:11.218
SABRINA:
Oh! No!

19:11.251 --> 19:13.152
Ah! No!

19:13.186 --> 19:16.323
No! No!

19:16.356 --> 19:17.457
It's chocolate.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.491
Ah!

19:20.360 --> 19:21.961
No! I swear, look!

19:21.994 --> 19:22.995
It's chocolate!

19:23.029 --> 19:24.831
(kids screaming)

19:26.833 --> 19:28.501
No, no, no,
no, no, nope.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.002
Please, not again!

19:30.036 --> 19:31.238
Hell no!

19:31.271 --> 19:32.672
Hot sauce!

19:32.705 --> 19:33.906
(screaming)

19:33.940 --> 19:34.974
MICKEY:
Yeah.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.477
It burns the eyes
and the face. See?

19:37.510 --> 19:38.478
My-my eyes!

19:38.511 --> 19:39.846
Hot sau...

19:43.683 --> 19:46.018
I ask you to keep a low profile,
cut back on expenses.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.321
And instead you buy drinks
for hundreds of people?

19:48.355 --> 19:49.489
It's tradition.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.491
Defecate in a pool?
I did not.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.492
And assault a man.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.361
Yeah. Yeah, I did.
Okay.

19:54.394 --> 19:58.030
Guys, this is a very
serious situation.

19:58.064 --> 20:00.600
Close to 30% of your family's
assets have been frozen.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.435
Well, hang on.
What about the rest?

20:02.469 --> 20:03.936
Well, the rest is fine.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.104
For now.

20:05.137 --> 20:07.607
But your family lost
millions of dollars.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.875
Okay, but you are saying

20:08.908 --> 20:11.210
that we still have millions
left to lose.

20:11.244 --> 20:13.513
Well, I wouldn't
put it that way.
CHIP: All right,

20:13.546 --> 20:15.848
way to go, Barry.
We're still rich.
Nice.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.850
I don't think you're hearing me.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.686
We need to make
some real adjustments,

20:19.719 --> 20:21.187
like that apartment
on Ninth Avenue.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.555
It doesn't get much use.

20:22.589 --> 20:23.556
Absolutely not.
Are you kidding me?

20:23.590 --> 20:25.625
MICKEY: We have an apartment
in the city?

20:25.658 --> 20:26.759
You have nothing!

20:26.793 --> 20:29.061
Well, this is news.
