>> Dad: This watch has been at
the center of a feud between the
watterson and finkelheimer

00:30.031 --> 00:33.732
families for centuries.
It was found by your
great-great-great-great-

00:33.734 --> 00:37.436
grandfather,
bucktooth watterson, who lost it
to an evil man called

00:37.438 --> 00:41.373

contest.
However, bucktooth's son, your

00:41.375 --> 00:44.877

grandfather...
But then ebenezer finkelheimer

00:44.879 --> 00:48.414
took it, even though he had
never slapped a peacock in his
entire life...

00:48.416 --> 00:52.217
...all that time, the watch was
hidden inside
Louie finkelheimer's girdle.

Then, when my dad finally
retrieved the watch after a

00:55.656 --> 01:02.127

gave it to me.
And now, little man, i give the

He told me this really long,

this for a second?

That's it.

12:49.736 --> 12:53.104
Laugh at me.
But at least I'm not a mindless
zombie, going through life just

12:53.106 --> 12:56.641
doing what they tell me to.
>> Who?
>> Gumball: You know, them.

12:56.643 --> 12:59.911
>> Who's "them"?
>> Gumball: You know, the man.
>> What man?

12:59.913 --> 13:03.214
>> Gumball: The man who tells
you what to do.
>> Who? My dad?

13:03.216 --> 13:06.818
>> Gumball: No. [Scoffs]
The people who tell you what to
watch on TV and stuff.

13:06.820 --> 13:12.924

accompanied by le fries of the

Mmm. Délicieux.
[ Tapping ]
>> What are "le fries of the

French"?
>> [ Normal voice ] Are you a
potato?

13:30.977 --> 13:33.144
>> As sure as the world is flat.

13:35.314 --> 13:38.449
>> Dad: Who's the bumpkin?
>> Mom: This is Idaho.
Gumball's friend from the

13:38.451 --> 13:41.820
country.
He's gonna be staying with us
this weekend.

13:41.822 --> 13:45.590
>> Dad: Where's your chair?
>> Mom: Gumball threw it away.
We're getting rid of our

13:45.592 --> 13:48.760
possessions to lead a simpler,
better life.
>> [ Grunts ]

13:48.762 --> 13:53.531

>> Gumball: It's Idaho.
He's gonna show us the way.

13:53.533 --> 13:56.634
>> Dad: The way to what?
>> Gumball: The way to ultimate
happiness.

13:56.636 --> 14:00.471
>> Dad: Is that a theme park?
>> Gumball: No, it's a free
world with no electricity, no

14:00.473 --> 14:05.977
cars, no supermarkets, and
especially no TV.
[ Dramatic music plays ]

14:10.249 --> 14:17.222

He's not joking, is he?
[ Dramatic music continues ]

14:19.291 --> 14:23.061
>> Gumball: [ Inhales deeply ]
Ahh.
Isn't it better to simply

14:23.063 --> 14:26.631
communicate rather than being
brainwashed by the TV?
>> Darwin: Dude, no one said a

14:26.633 --> 14:29.634
word for half an hour.
>> Dad: Nicole, punish gumball
for being boring.

14:29.636 --> 14:33.238
>> Mom: I really want to, but i
can't.
Gumball is exploring his outlook

14:33.240 --> 14:37.775
on society, and it's our job as
parents to encourage that, no
matter how much we might think

14:37.777 --> 14:42.380
it's completely ridiculous!
>> Gumball: [ Laughs nervously ]
So what do you noble savages do

14:42.382 --> 14:46.017
to entertain your tribe?
>> We play rough and tumble.
>> Darwin: What's that?

14:46.019 --> 14:50.288
>> Come on. I'll show you.
>> Now, the rules is that
there's no rules.

14:50.290 --> 14:53.858
You wrestle, and you make your
friend tumble.
>> Darwin: Wait, so, you can,

like, punch and stuff?
>> [ Laughing ] Well, you can
try, but i have to warn you.

14:58.531 --> 15:03.134
I've never been defeated in

Come on.

>> Mom: You didn't have to kick
him over a house.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.248
>> Darwin: I was defending
myself.
>> Anais: Against what?

15:17.250 --> 15:19.550
You're like eight times his
size.
>> Darwin: I panicked, okay?

15:19.552 --> 15:22.420
>> Dad: [ Laughs ]
Do it again! Do it again!

15:25.691 --> 15:29.560
>> You know what we do when we
need to cheer up?
We sing songs.

>> Anais: I hope the tooth fairy

15:53.320 --> 15:56.487
accepts change.
>> Dad: That's it.
I've had with your alternative,

15:56.489 --> 16:00.024
new-age nonsense.
It started boring, and now it's
painful.

16:00.026 --> 16:03.161
I'm going to the chicken place
to get a family bucket of
comfort food.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.396
>> Gumball: Look, we're in
search of freedom, and it comes
at a price.

16:05.398 --> 16:10.435
It's tough, but it's beautiful.
It's rough, but it's real.
It's dangerous, but it's...

It's --

There's nothing dangerous around

here.
Wasp!
[ All screaming ]

>> Mom: Darwin, don't blow it at
me.
Blow it away.

16:19.713 --> 16:23.314
>> I ain't seen this much
dancing since they invented the
mashed potato.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.483
>> Gumball: Yeah, calm down,
guys.
It's only a tiny insect.

16:25.485 --> 16:29.087
I'll show you how to handle it.
Hey, wasp, how about you just
go --

16:29.089 --> 16:32.390
ow! What the --?
Ow!
It stung me like a million

16:32.392 --> 16:35.093
times!
[ All screaming ]
>> Stop.

16:35.095 --> 16:38.262
Suck the poison out, and you'll
be just fine.
>> Gumball: Yeah, chill out,

16:38.264 --> 16:40.798
people.
It's only a wasp sting.
Just got to suck the poison out.

16:40.800 --> 16:46.037
[ Gulp! ] Ahh.
>> Anais: That's not how you
deal with a wasp sting.

16:46.039 --> 16:50.041
>> Gumball: I think I'm ready.
>> Mom: To go back inside?
>> Gumball: No, to live in the

16:50.043 --> 16:53.378
forest.
Come on!
To the forest of freedom where

16:53.380 --> 16:58.282
we can pick ripe fruit off the
laden trees and pluck fat fish
from the teeming rivers, paying

16:58.284 --> 17:02.820
for nothing and living for free.
>> Dad: Okay. Okay.
Look, where is it?

17:02.822 --> 17:05.690
>> Gumball: Wait, were you
following me?
'Cause, um...

17:05.692 --> 17:10.161
We'll just forage around the
neighborhood.
It's just as good as a forest.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.196
Ugh.
Is this really what you eat
every day?

17:12.198 --> 17:16.034
>> No.
What i eat is healthier.
It's the thing all food comes

17:16.036 --> 17:19.470
from and goes back to.
>> Darwin: Discount
supermarkets?

17:19.472 --> 17:22.306
>> Nope. Soil.
>> Gumball: Hey.
[ Gulp! ]

17:22.308 --> 17:26.944
Mmm. Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
>> Blech, this is disgusting.

17:26.946 --> 17:31.082
Hey, brain dude, should i spit?
>> Sorry, tongue guy.
Just man up and swallow.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.284
>> What?
Me and my boys are not digesting
this.

17:33.286 --> 17:36.454
>> Who are you calling "boys,"
stomach man?
I'm five times the length of

17:36.456 --> 17:39.057
this body.
>> Forget it, intestine.
[ Farting ] I'm tired of you

17:39.059 --> 17:42.860
always blowing hot air.
>> Come on, guys.
Can't we all just love each

17:42.862 --> 17:44.729
other?
>> No, we can't just love each
other.

17:44.731 --> 17:48.699
[ Indistinct conversations ]
>> Gumball: Mm. Mm.
>> You're not supposed to<i> eat</i>

17:48.701 --> 17:52.203
the soil.
You just rub on it yourself to
get the good things from it.

17:52.205 --> 17:55.173
>> Gumball: Oh, thank goodness.
I felt like my stomach was about
to punch my brain.

17:55.175 --> 18:00.344
[ Owl hoots ]
>> Anais: [ Sighs ]
How often do we just get to sit

18:00.346 --> 18:04.348
back and gaze at the stars?
>> Darwin: And it's actually
pretty comfortable out here.

18:04.350 --> 18:08.352
>> Dad: Speak for yourself.
Sleeping on the ground is more
painful than getting your back

18:08.354 --> 18:10.955
shredded by a million dirty
claws.
>> Darwin: I think you're

18:10.957 --> 18:14.792
sleeping on gumball.
>> Gumball: [ Gasps ]
[ Laughter ]

18:14.794 --> 18:19.931
>> Mom: This new lifestyle might
be a pain, but at least we
finally get some time together

I know what this looks like, but
before you tell me how wrong it
is, don't you want to try it?

Let's do it again.
Dude, wake up.

19:24.630 --> 19:27.598
>> Mom: What did you do to him?
>> Gumball: Nothing.
We just ate junk food and played

19:27.600 --> 19:30.568
video games.
>> Anais: That's it!
His pure country body couldn't

19:30.570 --> 19:33.871
handle your filthy suburban
lifestyle.
It sent him into toxic shock.

19:33.873 --> 19:37.375
>> Darwin: Wait, what were you
doing playing video games and
leaving us outside all night?

19:37.377 --> 19:40.178
You...You...
>> Gumball: Hypocrite?
Yeah, i know. I'm sorry.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.713
I hated this whole lifestyle
from the moment i turned off the
TV.

19:42.715 --> 19:45.850
>> Darwin: Then why did you
force us to keep it up?
>> Gumball: 'Cause i got

19:45.852 --> 19:48.452
principles.
It just turns out i can't live
by them.

19:48.454 --> 19:50.788
>> Aah!
>> Anais: Wait a minute.
He's a vegetable.

19:50.790 --> 19:54.458
He doesn't need a doctor.
He needs a gardener.
Take him back to his home.

It's okay.
I love you, too, my friend.

Your father knows exactly what
he's doing.

20:50.817 --> 20:56.187
>> Gumball: Noooo....He doesn't!
This sat nav is broken!
We've been everywhere apart from

where we need to be.
>> Dad: What are you talking
about?

20:59.225 --> 21:03.995
