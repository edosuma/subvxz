00:05.139 --> 00:07.973
Say, why are you pounding
nails in our front door?

00:07.975 --> 00:10.175
To keep the sign from falling.

00:10.177 --> 00:12.644
Don't you know
anything about gravity?

00:13.414 --> 00:14.747
Give me the hammer.

00:14.749 --> 00:15.614
Thanks for offering

00:15.616 --> 00:18.684
but the job's already done.

00:21.989 --> 00:24.123
Morning. Morning, dad.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.125
Have you practiced the poem?

00:26.127 --> 00:28.660
- Yes, ALF, but I--
- But nothing.

00:28.662 --> 00:29.895
Let's hear it.

00:29.897 --> 00:34.333
"Goodbye, grandma.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

00:34.335 --> 00:38.404
Goodbye, grandma.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye."

00:38.406 --> 00:40.973
Hmm. Maybe another
"Goodbye" in there.

00:40.975 --> 00:44.309
ALF, uh, what's this stuff
in this bag?

00:44.311 --> 00:46.812
I prepared a little flight kit.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.080
Nothing special.

00:48.082 --> 00:50.516
Just a few travel necessities.

00:50.518 --> 00:53.419
I emphasize the word "Travel."

00:53.421 --> 00:57.122
Magazines, uh, Kleenex..

00:57.124 --> 00:59.458
...uh, breath mints, antacids

00:59.460 --> 01:02.127
and moist towelettes.

01:02.129 --> 01:05.531
If she stops for anything
she might miss her plane.

01:06.367 --> 01:07.800
How very thoughtful of you.

01:07.802 --> 01:09.835
And, of course,
the bag will come in handy

01:09.837 --> 01:11.904
in case of turbulence.

01:11.906 --> 01:14.440
Or if they show
"Howard The Duck."

01:15.276 --> 01:17.009
Guess what?

01:18.312 --> 01:20.379
I'm not leaving.

01:21.382 --> 01:24.716
- Why not?
- ALF, don't be rude.

01:26.053 --> 01:27.920
Why not, Dorothy?

01:28.956 --> 01:31.590
I could just kill Estelle.

01:31.592 --> 01:34.026
She's decided to spend a few
more days with her daughter.

01:34.028 --> 01:37.729
Now, now, where does that
leave me and all my plans?

01:37.731 --> 01:40.566
[sighs]
Honestly, I hate
doing this, but..

01:40.568 --> 01:43.602
Well, I'm gonna have to
stay here a little while longer.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.605
You know, there's a nice
motel down the street.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.442
Just a thought.

I can't believe
you're actually watching

03:26.340 --> 03:28.240
"Midwest General."

03:28.242 --> 03:30.242
What's wrong
with "Midwest General?"

03:30.244 --> 03:31.977
Total sleaze.

03:31.979 --> 03:35.047
All you see is violence,
revenge, murder.

03:35.049 --> 03:36.448
That's not true.

03:36.450 --> 03:40.252

03:50.130 --> 03:51.496
That's not a soap opera

03:51.498 --> 03:52.831
that's a sleeping pill.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.267
Quiet. I want to see
what's happening.

03:55.269 --> 03:56.735
I'll tell you what's happening

03:56.737 --> 03:59.404
the same thing that was
happening a year ago.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.640

a plot transplant.

Butch, I really want you to know

04:14.655 --> 04:18.557
how proud we are of what
you did in that farmhouse.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.492
But, mom,
that was almost a year ago.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.227
(ALF)
'No kidding.'

04:23.664 --> 04:25.664
Maybe so, Butch..

04:25.666 --> 04:27.366
...but when you
put down that rake

04:27.368 --> 04:30.068
and told us you were our son..

04:31.205 --> 04:33.972
...that's not a moment
we'll soon forget.

04:33.974 --> 04:37.676
The very next day,
I conceived Alison.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.544
Then I was wrong.

04:39.546 --> 04:42.114
It was two years ago.

04:42.116 --> 04:43.982
Boring!

04:45.919 --> 04:47.853
Give me that back.

04:47.855 --> 04:50.289

04:55.829 --> 04:58.230
Incidentally,
when are you leaving?

04:59.500 --> 05:01.533
Soon. I'm leaving soon.

05:01.535 --> 05:04.770
You were supposed
to leave last week.

05:04.772 --> 05:07.606
You can see my bags
are packed, ready to go.

05:07.608 --> 05:10.309
I'm leaving when I'm leaving.

05:10.311 --> 05:12.911
Well, I'm glad
we narrowed it down.

05:14.915 --> 05:18.417
No wonder you can't appreciate
"One World To Hope For."

05:18.419 --> 05:20.419
You see, the people on this show

05:20.421 --> 05:22.521
they care about each other.

05:22.523 --> 05:25.757
That's because
they share a common bond..

05:25.759 --> 05:27.726

05:27.728 --> 05:29.728
Lucky could write
better than that.

05:29.730 --> 05:32.064
I could write
better than that.

05:32.066 --> 05:34.566
You write?
When would you find time?

If you're not

- What?

05:40.341 --> 05:42.674
- You know what?
- I want to see the x-rays!

- No!

you Bronx giraffe!

06:00.094 --> 06:02.094

is a guest in this house

06:02.096 --> 06:04.529
I want you
to treat her like one.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.632
- Well, thank you, Kate.
- Guest?

of limitations on that word?

is welcome to stay here

06:17.177 --> 06:19.177
as long as she wants.

06:20.381 --> 06:22.581
However long that may be.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.685
As a matter of fact,
mom, why don't I, uh

06:26.687 --> 06:30.155
put your suitcases
in the closet?

06:30.157 --> 06:33.792
Oh, sure, honey,
if you feel they're in the way.

let her get to you.

You know where
she is right now?

07:01.288 --> 07:05.023
She is at the market,
buying a decent tile cleaner.

07:06.293 --> 07:08.527
Decent tile cleaner.

07:08.529 --> 07:10.162
She'll be gone
in a couple of weeks.

07:10.164 --> 07:12.330
Sure. First,
she said a few more days

07:12.332 --> 07:14.866
then she said another week,
now, she says two more weeks.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.134
She didn't know that Estelle

07:16.136 --> 07:17.869
was gonna sprain her ankle,
you know?

07:17.871 --> 07:21.706
What is a woman Estelle's age
doing on a skateboard?

07:23.043 --> 07:25.310
An-and wh-why does mother
have to wait for her anyway?

07:25.312 --> 07:26.678
She's a grown woman.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.147
She can fly by herself!

07:30.184 --> 07:31.950
She's a grown woman.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.518
You better put
that bag down, honey

07:33.520 --> 07:35.387
you're gonna
cut off your oxygen.

07:35.389 --> 07:37.422
That's what I'm trying to do.

07:39.193 --> 07:41.793
You've got to try
and pin her down, Kate.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.930
Good idea. I'll get the pins.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.699
We'll handle this.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.934
We'll handle this.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.303
That's right, she's my mother.

07:51.305 --> 07:54.105
Is the word
"Mother" capitalized?

07:55.242 --> 07:58.009
Say, what're you writing
down over there, anyway?

07:58.011 --> 07:59.911
Who, me?

07:59.913 --> 08:03.648
No, the man-in-the-moon.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.283
Oh, Fred.

08:05.285 --> 08:08.453
I don't know. He never writes,
he never calls.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.392
Hurry up,
the show's about to start.

08:14.394 --> 08:16.962
I can't believe
you're actually forcing me

08:16.964 --> 08:18.830
to watch
"One World To Hope For."

08:18.832 --> 08:21.233
Well, this is
a very special episode.

was the best seat in the house.

08:29.443 --> 08:31.309
That was yesterday.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.648
"Written by ALF Shumway?"

08:36.650 --> 08:38.717
You wrote a TV script?

08:38.719 --> 08:40.151
Yes, I wrote it.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.953
What, all you have to do
is write a script

08:41.955 --> 08:43.355
and now they'll put it
on the air?

08:43.357 --> 08:45.657
Well, you have to send
it in first.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.726
Oh, it's starting.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.665
It's your mother, isn't it?

08:53.667 --> 08:55.267
Yes.

08:55.269 --> 08:57.435
She's been here forever.

08:57.437 --> 08:59.170
W-w-what is she talking about?

08:59.172 --> 09:01.973
That character
doesn't even have a mother.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.142
She's driving me crazy.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.678
Do you know
where she is right now?

09:06.680 --> 09:08.813
At the market.

09:08.815 --> 09:11.316
Buying a decent tile cleaner.

09:13.053 --> 09:16.221
Put the bag down, Monica,
you'll cut off your oxygen.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.857
That's what I'm trying to do.

09:19.626 --> 09:21.259
I have to stir the cheese.

09:21.261 --> 09:24.996
Sit still, Kate.
The cheese can wait.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.331
Why don't you just pin her down

09:26.333 --> 09:29.000
and ask her
when she's gonna leave?

09:29.002 --> 09:31.703
Good idea, I'll get the pins.

09:31.705 --> 09:34.673
[laughing]

09:34.675 --> 09:38.176
She's here. My mother's here.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.478
Back with the tile cleaner.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.685
- Hello, mother.
- Hello, Dorothy.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.386
Her name is Dorothy?

09:48.388 --> 09:52.824
Yeah, but that's not
the right tile cleaner. Oh!

09:52.826 --> 09:55.427
Why are you staring
at me like that?

09:55.429 --> 09:58.063
You look like
you wanna ask me something?

09:58.065 --> 10:01.499
Well, actually, I do.

10:01.501 --> 10:03.969
So, go on, ask me.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.837
When are you gonna
leave, already?

10:05.839 --> 10:08.506
Leave? You want me to leave?

10:08.508 --> 10:12.077
No, I want
the man-in-the-moon to leave.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.112
Yes, I want you to leave.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.447
I want you to go home

10:15.449 --> 10:18.483
and live with your friend,
crazy Miriam.

10:21.455 --> 10:23.321
Mom, wait.

10:29.563 --> 10:32.197
Thanks, a hell of a lot.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.133
Worked for me.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.976
[instrumental music]

10:49.082 --> 10:52.317
How can I write dialogue
if nobody's gonna talk?

10:52.319 --> 10:55.420
Come on, people.
I've got a deadline.

10:56.490 --> 11:00.358
You've got a poison pen,
is what you've got.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.127
Turning our private
conversations

11:02.129 --> 11:05.463
into a public spectacle.
How insensitive can you get?

11:05.465 --> 11:08.533
Hey, would you mind
if I taped this?

11:08.535 --> 11:13.104
There will be no tape
recording and no writing!

11:13.106 --> 11:15.473
Kate, that's dangerously
close to censorship.

11:15.475 --> 11:17.609
You are dangerously close
to being evicted.

11:17.611 --> 11:19.144
Point made.

11:19.146 --> 11:22.147
Look, uh, I realize
what I did was wrong

11:22.149 --> 11:25.216
but I'm gonna make it up to you
in this new script.

11:25.218 --> 11:29.154
Well, I'm glad somebody
cares about my feelings.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.990
Oh, mom, I care
about your feelings.

11:31.992 --> 11:36.161
- I'm sorry that I hurt you.
- It's okay.

11:36.163 --> 11:39.164
Listen, maybe I should leave.

11:39.166 --> 11:42.500
I'll call Estelle.
I'll go home today.

11:42.502 --> 11:45.236
I thought Estelle
had a sprained leg?

11:46.573 --> 11:48.173
Uh..

11:48.175 --> 11:51.976
It-it wasn't her leg.
It was her ankle.

11:51.978 --> 11:54.379
And I made it up.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.048
- What?
- Well, I-I made it up.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.984
I ma-made up the whole story
about her ankle

11:59.986 --> 12:02.654
because, uh,
I didn't want you to know

12:02.656 --> 12:05.123
that I couldn't stand
my best friend anymore.

12:05.125 --> 12:08.660
I mean, she was impossible
to live with, so I left.

12:08.662 --> 12:11.129
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
are you telling me

12:11.131 --> 12:14.532
that you moved out
of Estelle's house?

12:14.534 --> 12:16.167
Yes.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.803
Well, you can't stay here.

12:18.805 --> 12:21.206
How would you like
to become a sweater?

12:22.175 --> 12:25.677
Have Dorothy burst into flames.

12:25.679 --> 12:29.748
Mom, why didn't you tell me
about you and Estelle before?

12:29.750 --> 12:33.051
Well, you, you would just
feel sorry for me

12:33.053 --> 12:35.186
and then you'd ask me to stay.

12:35.188 --> 12:38.056
Good, good. Work it out.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.657
I don't have to feel
sorry for you

12:39.659 --> 12:41.993
to ask you
to stay in my house.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.595
Are you asking me to stay?

12:43.597 --> 12:45.096
[phone ringing]

12:45.098 --> 12:47.365
I'll get the phone.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.634
Yeah, then leave it off
the hook, will ya?

12:49.636 --> 12:51.503
We're on a roll.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.373
Hello.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.108
Who?

12:57.844 --> 12:59.844
Oh, ye..

12:59.846 --> 13:02.347
Yes. Yes.

13:02.349 --> 13:05.850
It's for you, the head writer on
"One World To Hope For"

13:05.852 --> 13:07.552
wants to know
where the script is.

13:07.554 --> 13:10.488
Says they're
shooting it tomorrow.

13:10.490 --> 13:13.691
Oh, good,
and I don't have squat.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.495
Hello, Trish doll.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.731
Yeah, yeah,
oh, I know I said that

13:19.733 --> 13:21.399
I'd have it in your hands today

13:21.401 --> 13:23.701
but I had to make
a few changes.

13:23.703 --> 13:26.037
Yeah, oh, it's a much
better script now.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.339
I thought you
didn't have squat.

13:28.341 --> 13:31.042
Uh, uh, Trish, quick thought.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.578
How do you feel
about having a cat on the show?

13:33.580 --> 13:35.446
A speaking part.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.782
Yeah, you're right.
Too sitcomey.

13:37.784 --> 13:40.318
Well, anyway, here's the new
ending I decided to go with.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.287
See, I think we need
to put more warmth

13:42.289 --> 13:44.556
and likability
into these characters.

13:44.558 --> 13:47.559
[instrumental music]

13:58.471 --> 14:00.471
[screaming]

14:02.008 --> 14:04.375
ALF, ALF, are you alright?

14:04.377 --> 14:07.712
Oh, yeah, everything's fine.

14:07.714 --> 14:09.180
Why..

14:09.182 --> 14:11.115
Why do you have
those clothespins

14:11.117 --> 14:12.984
attached to your head?

14:12.986 --> 14:15.153
It's a form of acupressure.

14:15.155 --> 14:19.524
On Melmac we use it
to relieve writer's block.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.359
Still having trouble
with the script, eh?

14:21.361 --> 14:24.128
[sighs]
Read it yourself.

14:24.130 --> 14:27.065
"Scene one.
Interior living root."

14:27.067 --> 14:30.201
Interior living root?

14:30.203 --> 14:32.437
It's a typo!
I mean, give me a break!

14:32.439 --> 14:34.639
- I've only got eight fingers.
- I'm sorry.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.474
Uh, "Monica enters

14:36.476 --> 14:38.476
she says, 'Good morning.'"

14:38.478 --> 14:40.578
Well, what's wrong with that?

14:40.580 --> 14:42.881
Willie there's no one else
in the room with her!

14:42.883 --> 14:45.717
I've got the woman
talking to chairs!

14:45.719 --> 14:48.686
Oh, I'll never have this
finished by tomorrow.

14:48.688 --> 14:50.989
Listen, you ought
to try to relax, ALF.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.124
Relax. Sure, relax.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.459
I've got a deadline.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.594
I mean, I promised
to put likability

14:56.596 --> 14:59.497
and warmth
into these characters.

14:59.499 --> 15:03.301
You know, I had a, I had a case
of writer's block once.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.504
I was writing a term paper
for my art history class.

15:06.506 --> 15:09.207
Or-or-or was it
my comparative religion class?

15:09.209 --> 15:11.442
What, are you dictating
your autobiography?

15:11.444 --> 15:13.811
- I'm trying to help here.
- Well, you're not!

15:13.813 --> 15:15.780
Well, look, why don't you
just start writing.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.882
Write anything
that comes into your head.

15:17.884 --> 15:20.585
Just put down the first thing
that pops into your head.

15:20.587 --> 15:21.920
Fine.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.122
[keys clacking]

15:26.793 --> 15:29.928
- "I have writers block."
- Monica wouldn't say that!

15:29.930 --> 15:32.597
- See, Monica wouldn't say that!
- Don't panic here, ALF.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.199
Don't panic.
Don't be so nervous.

15:35.201 --> 15:38.002
Nervous?
I've had 50 cups of coffee.

15:38.004 --> 15:41.572
I'm so wired I had
to strap myself to this chair.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.374
Is that my belt?

15:43.376 --> 15:45.576
If you're not gonna help,
go back in the house.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.612
I can't go back in the house.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.281
There are two women in there who
aren't speaking to each other

15:50.283 --> 15:52.617
or to me or to you.

15:52.619 --> 15:57.021
In fact, ALF, you've written
us into this...this mess

15:57.023 --> 15:59.257
now, you've got to write us out.

15:59.259 --> 16:02.193
Alright. Alright. I will.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.462
Put on another pot of coffee.

16:09.569 --> 16:12.003
[screaming]

16:12.005 --> 16:14.339
And get some more clothespins.

16:16.242 --> 16:18.910
You're all gonna love
this episode, I promise.

16:18.912 --> 16:21.612
This script
is so full of love, compassion

16:21.614 --> 16:25.483
and understanding,
that you'll throw up.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.585
That good?

16:27.587 --> 16:30.621
Oh, hi. I'm sorry I'm late.
Did I, did I miss anything?

16:30.623 --> 16:32.090
- Just lunch.
- Oh, honey.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.725
There's some blintzes
on a plate near the stove.

16:33.727 --> 16:36.327
- 'Oh.'
- Those were for him?

16:36.997 --> 16:38.830
We still have the plate.

16:38.832 --> 16:42.533
I don't eat stoneware.
Unlike some people.

16:42.535 --> 16:45.503
Look, look, there's the mother.
How about that, huh?

16:45.505 --> 16:47.705
They even dressed her nicer.

16:48.608 --> 16:52.243
- Good morning.
- Mother.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.912
Does this mean
you're speaking to me again?

16:54.914 --> 16:56.481
Monica..

16:56.483 --> 16:58.483
...you're my daughter.

16:58.485 --> 17:01.819
Not some alien
from another planet.

17:01.821 --> 17:04.489
I wrote that as a joke,
they left it in.

17:04.491 --> 17:06.357
Mothers and daughters
are bound to have

17:06.359 --> 17:09.027
their little
quarrels and conflicts.

17:09.029 --> 17:13.064
It's part of this whole
wonderful thing we call life.

17:13.066 --> 17:16.534
You're right, it is nauseating.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.736
I-I think that it's sweet.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.905
I mean, i-it
lets us know that, uh

17:20.907 --> 17:22.273
just because a person says

17:22.275 --> 17:23.908
a few unkind things
about someone

17:23.910 --> 17:27.178
it doesn't mean
that they don't love them.

17:27.180 --> 17:30.448
So, by the same token

17:30.450 --> 17:32.784
I hope you'll be able
to forgive me

17:32.786 --> 17:34.886
when I tell you
what an ungrateful

17:34.888 --> 17:37.688
self-centered
little tramp you are.

17:38.958 --> 17:40.958
Self-centered little tramp?

17:42.362 --> 17:45.196
Why, just who do you think
you're talking to

17:45.198 --> 17:48.332
you bossy, loudmouth freeloader?

17:48.334 --> 17:50.301
Tramp?

17:50.303 --> 17:54.205
- Freeloader?
- They changed my script!

17:54.207 --> 17:57.475
Now, calm down, Monica,
she's not worth it.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.277
Huh, that's not what you said

17:59.279 --> 18:01.979
when you left
my bedroom last night.

18:03.883 --> 18:06.617
They changed his script.

18:06.619 --> 18:10.321
She's lying. I never went
anywhere near her bedroom.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.523
She's done nothing but lie

18:12.525 --> 18:14.092
since the moment
she walked into this house

18:14.094 --> 18:16.928
and told us
she'd only be here a few days.

18:18.364 --> 18:20.898
I am not going to sit here,
and eat toast

18:20.900 --> 18:23.468
and listen to this!

18:23.470 --> 18:25.203
ALF, how could you?

18:25.205 --> 18:27.505
I'm telling you, I didn't.

18:27.507 --> 18:30.108
They were hugging
and kissing in my script.

18:30.110 --> 18:32.944
I had nothing about toast.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.645
And did you see
that centerpiece?

18:34.647 --> 18:37.682
I mean, who's doing props
over there, Rip Taylor?

18:39.052 --> 18:41.152
Well, I am sick of having this

18:41.154 --> 18:44.122
entire visit shoved in my face.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.656
Where are the famous suitcases?

18:45.658 --> 18:48.359
Mom, I don't want you to go.

18:48.361 --> 18:51.195
Well, once again
you've brought harmony

18:51.197 --> 18:52.964
to our household.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.066
That's not what I wrote.

18:56.936 --> 19:00.371
Here. Here.
This is what I wrote. Read it.

19:01.541 --> 19:04.175
There's not one word
of violence in there.

19:04.177 --> 19:06.410
And I cut out all the sex too.

19:06.412 --> 19:09.247
- Sex? Who had sex?
- What sex?

19:09.249 --> 19:11.549
It's gone, I said.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.417
You know, I think
ALF is telling the truth.

19:13.419 --> 19:15.186
Thank you.

19:15.188 --> 19:16.754
I mean, about the fight anyway.

19:16.756 --> 19:20.124
There's, there's no fight
in her, but..

19:20.126 --> 19:23.027
You do use a lot of "You knows."

19:23.029 --> 19:24.896
I know.

19:24.898 --> 19:27.565
Well, I'm just gonna pack
the rest of my things.

19:27.567 --> 19:31.335
Come back here!
You're not going anywhere.

19:31.337 --> 19:35.339
I mean, not until you read
the scene I really wrote.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.241
You could at least
give me that.

19:37.243 --> 19:40.845
Well, you-you just give me
one good reason why I should.

19:40.847 --> 19:44.715
Okay. I'll give you one reason.
Kate.

19:47.086 --> 19:49.520
Now, come on. Turn to page 18.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.589
Let's all read it out loud.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.457
Kate, you be Monica.

19:53.459 --> 19:56.394
Dorothy, why don't
you be Dorothy.

20:06.206 --> 20:08.573
"Mom, it's not that
I don't want you to live here

20:08.575 --> 20:11.375
"it's just that
I'm a married woman.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.811
I have a life of my own,
you know?"

20:16.516 --> 20:17.949
This is so silly.

20:17.951 --> 20:21.619
Come on, come on.
Just read it!

20:21.621 --> 20:24.789
"You're right,
it was wrong of me to impose.

20:24.791 --> 20:26.557
"But, you know,
I just couldn't help it.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.427
I tried, but,
you know, I couldn't."

20:29.429 --> 20:31.362
You do use a lot of "You knows."

20:31.364 --> 20:34.298
They bother you, drop 'em!

20:34.300 --> 20:37.635
Say, doesn't the father
have any lines?

20:37.637 --> 20:41.272
Willie, sometimes less is more.

20:41.274 --> 20:42.740
Monica?

20:43.943 --> 20:47.445
"You feel a little lost
since dad died, don't you?"

20:52.185 --> 20:54.452
"It's not easy living alone.

20:55.788 --> 20:58.889
"That's why I moved in
with Miriam, crazy as she is.

20:58.891 --> 21:01.993
It was someone
to talk to, you know?"

21:01.995 --> 21:04.328
Now, that one works.

21:04.330 --> 21:06.530
"I like to be with people.

21:06.532 --> 21:08.766
"I like to take care of them.

21:10.103 --> 21:14.538
Maybe I go too far sometimes
that's because I care too much."

21:14.540 --> 21:17.742
"Miriam asked you
to move out, didn't she?"

21:18.444 --> 21:20.011
Yes.

21:21.748 --> 21:24.548
Estelle asked you to move out?

21:25.551 --> 21:28.152
That's why your mom came here.

21:28.154 --> 21:30.221
She didn't want to be
alone again.

21:30.223 --> 21:34.158
- How did you know?
- Writer's intuition.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.027
I also called Estelle.

21:36.029 --> 21:39.897
And by the way,
you're right, she is crazy.

21:41.134 --> 21:44.235
Estelle told me that
I was bossy and meddlesome

21:44.237 --> 21:48.673
and she couldn't stand
another day living with me.

21:48.675 --> 21:51.475
I don't care
what Estelle said.

21:51.477 --> 21:54.178
You're my mother,
and I love you.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.950
I don't know what to say.

21:59.952 --> 22:02.520
Right there,
middle of the page!

22:02.522 --> 22:04.722
- What?
- The script.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.625
Oh.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.730
"You know what, Monica?

22:12.732 --> 22:15.599
"My best friend
didn't kick me out.

22:15.601 --> 22:17.735
"My best friend..

22:18.371 --> 22:20.871
...is right here."

22:20.873 --> 22:22.873
Oh, mom.

22:23.609 --> 22:25.242
No, no, no.

22:25.244 --> 22:27.478
First, you open the champagne

22:27.480 --> 22:29.146
then you hug.

22:29.148 --> 22:32.149
Oh, nobody reads
stage directions.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.188
[instrumental music]

22:38.424 --> 22:41.325
She's a baby. Dating?

22:41.327 --> 22:43.361
(Kate)
I know, seems like..

22:43.363 --> 22:45.463
- 'Hi, honey!'
- Oh, hi, guys.

22:45.465 --> 22:46.997
(Dorothy)
'Willie.'

22:49.902 --> 22:53.237
- Honey, are you alright?
- Yeah. Yeah.

22:53.239 --> 22:54.939
Say, Dorothy..

22:54.941 --> 22:55.973
...are you sure
you don't want me

22:55.975 --> 22:57.775
to store these up in the attic?

22:57.777 --> 22:59.577
Uh, no, Willie.

22:59.579 --> 23:02.146
Listen, I plan to find
a place of my own

23:02.148 --> 23:03.647
as soon as possible.

23:03.649 --> 23:05.149
Well, you know,
you're more than welcome

23:05.151 --> 23:07.251
to stay here
as long as you like.

23:07.253 --> 23:10.454
No, I know that, kids,
but ALF is right.

23:10.456 --> 23:12.523
I've got to try..

23:12.525 --> 23:14.325
Wait a minute,
how'd he phrase that?

23:14.327 --> 23:18.129
"I've got to start
to make a life of my own."

23:18.131 --> 23:21.298
- ALF told you that?
- Well, not exactly.

23:21.300 --> 23:25.236
- It's in his new script.
- New script?

23:26.072 --> 23:27.772
ALF, would you come out here?

23:27.774 --> 23:30.741
We'd like to talk
to you for a minute.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.176
Make it quick, Kate

23:32.178 --> 23:34.945
things have
just started to flow again.

23:34.947 --> 23:38.115
ALF, uh, I thought
that you gave up script writing.

23:38.117 --> 23:40.484
Yeah, I thought you were
so upset with the rewrites

23:40.486 --> 23:42.653
you were never gonna
write another script again.

23:42.655 --> 23:45.322
- I wasn't.
- So what happened?

23:45.324 --> 23:47.625
The check came.

23:53.633 --> 23:56.834

24:22.428 --> 24:24.428
