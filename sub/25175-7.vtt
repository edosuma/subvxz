[Joe]
Previously on
Condor...

00:03.300 --> 00:04.881
[Joe]
I found
.72 she// companies

00:04.990 --> 00:07.686
that together bought
_ a billion dollars
In pharmaceutical stocks.

00:07.790 --> 00:10.202
My entire oﬁ‘i'ce
/3' being k/Y/ea' because of it.

00:10.310 --> 00:12.642
For everyone in that office,
this is just another job,

00:12.750 --> 00:14.650
but you are personally
interested in the truth.

00:14.760 --> 00:16.899
Joe Turner is Me a son to me.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.217
And there is no doubt
in my mind

00:18.320 --> 00:19.332
that he didn ’t do those things.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.852
-Shot of 1942.
-Can I buy you that shot?

00:21.960 --> 00:24.428
-Fuckin' cock tease.
-[grunts]

00:24.530 --> 00:27.067
Sam, Mae,
this is my wife, Iris.

00:27.170 --> 00:28.546
It's so nice to meet you.

00:28.650 --> 00:32.063
On September 11th,
Ammar Nazari will attempt
to release a plague.

00:32.170 --> 00:34.149
It’s the prologue
to a larger plot.

00:34.260 --> 00:37.593
I wish I was
more to you than a woman
whose husband died.

00:37.700 --> 00:38.951
You are more
to me than that.

00:39.060 --> 00:41.676
[screaming]

00:41.780 --> 00:43.361
[Nathan ]
The prel/minary stages
are complete.

00:43.470 --> 00:45.165
Abu-Saeed has been infected.

00:45.270 --> 00:47.079
The delivery man is en route.

00:47.190 --> 00:49.181
You put your gun
on the ground, right now.

00:49.710 --> 00:50.768
[grunts]

00:50.870 --> 00:52.770

She's upstairs.

00:57.120 --> 00:58.929
-Kathy!

01:38.330 --> 01:40.321
[singing hymn]

02:19.410 --> 02:21.401
He's smaller.

02:23.370 --> 02:26.134
People always look smaller
in death than in life.

02:29.300 --> 02:31.291
That's what happens
when your soul

02:32.300 --> 02:34.302
leaves the body.

02:35.950 --> 02:37.759
His body is decomposing.

02:37.870 --> 02:42.648
Everyone thinks your hair
and nails keep growing
when you're dead.

02:42.760 --> 02:44.910
But it's really just your skin
that shrinks.

02:47.040 --> 02:49.031
That's why we look smaller.

02:49.680 --> 02:51.671
Nothing grows
when you're dead.

02:55.370 --> 02:57.361
[funeral music continues]

03:11.270 --> 03:13.261
[priest talking indistinctly
in background]

03:19.350 --> 03:21.352
I thought you quit smoking.

03:23.400 --> 03:24.617
[inhales]

03:24.720 --> 03:28.190
I tend to start again,
when people I love die.

03:29.290 --> 03:30.302
That's dumb.

03:30.410 --> 03:32.401
[chuckles]

03:33.810 --> 03:36.381
You're just like him,
you know that?

03:36.490 --> 03:38.264
I know that's what people say.

03:38.370 --> 03:41.259
But I never spent enough time
with him to know
if it was true.

03:45.540 --> 03:49.124
[sighs] Being away
from your mom and you,

03:49.230 --> 03:51.221
wasn't the life
he wanted, either.

03:53.270 --> 03:55.261
Then he should have come home.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.350
He denied himself
what he wanted...

04:02.160 --> 04:04.299
Because what was
Important to hIm

04:04.400 --> 04:06.402
was not the world
that he lived in,

04:07.730 --> 04:09.721
but the one
that he wanted to leave

04:10.410 --> 04:12.401
to his family.

04:13.450 --> 04:15.441
To his son.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.730
You'll understand that more
when you're older.

04:21.460 --> 04:23.451
I don't think so.

04:25.950 --> 04:27.941
It's okay to cry, you know.

04:28.310 --> 04:30.301
I cry.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.861
VVhen?

04:38.080 --> 04:42.050
You were born with
an intellect

04:42.160 --> 04:44.162
that makes you unique.

04:44.730 --> 04:46.789
You process things

04:46.890 --> 04:50.064
faster than other people,
and that's good,

04:50.170 --> 04:53.355
but it _can_also create
an Illu5|on In your mInd
that you understand things

04:53.460 --> 04:55.712
that you don't understand,

04:55.820 --> 04:57.799
and you have to learn
to feel things.

04:57.900 --> 04:59.879
And it doesn't matter
how smart you are,

04:59.980 --> 05:01.971
you'll never really understand

05:02.750 --> 05:04.741
what it means to be human.

06:18.310 --> 06:20.301

Hey.

08:16.110 --> 08:17.281
Hey.

08:17.390 --> 08:20.018
-What is this place?
-[laughs]

08:20.120 --> 08:23.078
-Why aren't you dancing?
-'Cause I can't hear the music.

08:23.760 --> 08:25.853
Dance with me.

08:25.960 --> 08:27.962
I can't hear.

08:28.810 --> 08:30.619
Want a drink?

08:30.730 --> 08:32.721
No.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.717
You touch me again,
and I’ll put you

09:21.740 --> 09:23.321
Hello?

09:23.430 --> 09:25.125
[man over phone]
I have some bad news.

09:25.230 --> 09:28.279
Boyd Ferris was found dead
in Kathy Hale ’s
neighbor’s house.

09:28.390 --> 09:30.381
I just--
I thought you should know.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.231
[sobbing]

09:44.850 --> 09:46.841
[indistinct chatter]

10:10.880 --> 10:13.394
[breathing heavily]

10:28.740 --> 10:30.674
Did anyone here

10:30.780 --> 10:33.908
notice a note on Kathy Hale's
refrigerator door

10:34.020 --> 10:36.011
with instructions
for feeding a cat?

10:38.230 --> 10:40.664
And was there a cat
in that house?

10:43.430 --> 10:45.204
Who checked this place out?

10:45.310 --> 10:46.777
We came here twice.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.871
We knocked on the door,
but we didn't--

10:51.480 --> 10:53.471
-[sighs]
-[cell phone vibrates]

10:58.370 --> 11:00.361
[Marty answers phone] Yeah?

11:01.290 --> 11:03.269
What?

11:03.370 --> 11:04.871
[Marty sighs]

11:04.980 --> 11:06.971
Where'd you find her?

11:21.070 --> 11:23.061

[vomiting]

11:36.010 --> 11:38.001
[coughing]

11:48.500 --> 11:50.491
We should talk.

12:15.210 --> 12:17.201
-[Bob sighs]
-Two people,

12:18.050 --> 12:20.052
my people,

12:21.780 --> 12:23.077
[sniffles]

12:23.180 --> 12:26.536
found Katherine Hale
last night, at her
neighbor's house.

12:28.260 --> 12:29.727
Turner was gone.

12:29.830 --> 12:32.321
Hale wasn't tied up,
so they figured that

12:32.430 --> 12:34.421
maybe she was involved
with him.

12:35.070 --> 12:36.640
Involved, how?

12:36.750 --> 12:38.012
I don't know.

12:38.120 --> 12:40.179
But they waited

12:40.280 --> 12:42.271
for him to come back.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.978
Did they call it in?

12:45.080 --> 12:48.538
They were worried that
there was a mole on their team.

12:48.650 --> 12:52.108
So, if I hadn't called you,
if you hadn't warned him--

12:52.210 --> 12:53.746
Joe would be dead.

12:53.850 --> 12:55.909
It's a trade-off.

12:56.010 --> 12:58.592
I don't take pleasure
in making it,
but that's what it is.

12:58.700 --> 13:00.816
You didn't make it! I did!

13:02.420 --> 13:04.809
They waited for Joe. What then?

13:07.790 --> 13:11.009
Then he took out one
of the operatives with
the butt of his gun,

13:11.110 --> 13:12.998
and he killed Ferris.

13:13.110 --> 13:17.058
And why would Joe
sneak into a house where

13:17.160 --> 13:20.618
two federal officers
are waiting for him?

13:20.720 --> 13:23.416
The only reason I'm having
this conversation with you

13:23.520 --> 13:25.943
is I'm looking for another
version of this story

13:26.050 --> 13:27.745
where I didn't just get
two people killed.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.420
Well, you won't find it
in a bottle.

13:29.530 --> 13:31.418
If you can't give me
a good enough reason, Bob,

13:31.530 --> 13:34.158
I'm going to turn myself in
along with you!

13:34.260 --> 13:36.251
[scoffs and chuckles] I see.

13:40.140 --> 13:44.008
I'm working in the dark here,
but ifI can guess the name

13:44.110 --> 13:48.080
of the operative who
was with Boyd Ferris,

13:48.190 --> 13:50.181
will you try to keep
an open mind?

13:55.760 --> 13:57.751
Gabrielle Joubert.

14:03.330 --> 14:05.218
I'm listening.

14:05.330 --> 14:07.321
I've read her file.

14:07.690 --> 14:10.329
You hire her for one result.

14:13.340 --> 14:15.274
Do you think she

14:15.380 --> 14:17.598
_killed an American
Intelligence agent?

14:17.700 --> 14:19.850
I think she murdered
11 of them.

14:20.790 --> 14:22.781
I think she killed Sarah.

14:25.910 --> 14:27.605
[Sharla gasping]

14:27.710 --> 14:29.450
Joubert...

14:29.560 --> 14:32.916
...might not be
our best point of attack
at the moment.

14:34.120 --> 14:36.111
There's one person.

14:37.200 --> 14:40.658
I have a hunch
he was involved,

14:40.770 --> 14:44.524
who may have lost his chance
to clean up after himself.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.252
VVho?

[sobbing]

15:08.040 --> 15:10.031
[Jude screaming]

15:19.730 --> 15:21.823
Hey! What, what happened?

15:21.930 --> 15:23.943
-I saw him.
-What? Who, who?

15:24.050 --> 15:26.268
-He's in the baclqard.
-Who's in the backyard?

15:26.380 --> 15:29.110
-[Sam Jr.] Go to sleep.
-What?

15:29.220 --> 15:32.109
-Uncle Joe.
-No, no, no, baby,
you had a bad dream.

15:32.220 --> 15:34.723
-It was real.
-No. Look at me,
you had a bad dream, okay?

15:34.830 --> 15:37.128
-It was real.
-Come here, look.

15:37.230 --> 15:39.221
Look, there's nobody
out there.

15:39.590 --> 15:41.569
I saw him.

15:41.670 --> 15:43.854
You want to go out and look?

15:43.960 --> 15:45.951
Okay.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.671
Mom!

15:50.600 --> 15:52.170
[Jude] I did see Joe, Granny.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.487
[grandmother] Mom's looking,
all right. It's gonna be okay.

15:56.210 --> 15:58.201
See? There's nobody here.

16:00.810 --> 16:02.812
Just a bad dream, baby.

16:03.900 --> 16:05.390
[Jude] But I saw him.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.673
[Mae] No.

16:07.780 --> 16:09.429
You're just having a nightmare.

16:09.540 --> 16:11.531
Come on.

16:13.990 --> 16:15.981
[sighs]

16:18.230 --> 16:20.221
[vacuum whirring]

16:50.550 --> 16:52.541
[breathing heavily]

16:58.760 --> 17:00.455
A little early for cooking?

17:00.560 --> 17:02.551
[chuckles]

17:02.880 --> 17:04.768
Going to Mae's.

17:04.880 --> 17:06.211
Oh.

17:06.320 --> 17:09.483
Oh, the procession
of casseroles and condolences.

17:11.170 --> 17:13.229
Did you get any sleep
last night?

17:13.330 --> 17:16.265
I woke up, and you were gone.

17:16.370 --> 17:18.395
I should have called.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.196
I hope I didn't scare you.

17:21.300 --> 17:25.157
These days, when I wake up
in the middle of the night
and you're there, I'm scared.

17:25.260 --> 17:27.387
You've been very decent
through all this.

17:30.750 --> 17:34.288
I meant about not bringing up
how angry you were with me

17:34.390 --> 17:36.392
-for recruiting Joe.
-Bob,

17:37.400 --> 17:39.391
I know what you meant.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.402
-Any news?
-Nothing good.

17:46.410 --> 17:48.401
[sighs]

17:53.370 --> 17:55.372
[softly] Be safe, Joe.

18:01.740 --> 18:03.742
[door closes]

18:04.310 --> 18:06.528
[Jude] Why do I have to go
to Uncle Alan's?

18:06.630 --> 18:09.428
'Cause some of my friends
are coming over today, and
it won't be very fun for you.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.381
Why are they coming over?

18:13.400 --> 18:15.379
To give their condolences.

18:15.480 --> 18:17.471
What are condolences?

18:18.120 --> 18:19.690
It's like saying you're sorry.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.802
What are they sorry about?

18:22.850 --> 18:24.841
About Daddy.

18:28.370 --> 18:32.352
So they come over, say sorry,
andleave?

18:32.460 --> 18:34.951
No. They bring food,

18:35.060 --> 18:36.231
and they talk.

18:36.340 --> 18:38.456
-What will they talk about?
-I don't know.

18:39.900 --> 18:42.368
Probably they'll say nice
stories about Daddy.

18:42.470 --> 18:44.461
How much they liked him.

18:45.030 --> 18:47.021
Sounds nice.

18:47.470 --> 18:49.461
Okay, well, you can stay
with me if you want to.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.614
-Yea h?
-Yeah.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.415
Okay.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.294
What about you, Sam,
do you want to stay?

18:56.400 --> 18:58.391
No, Uncle Alan's.

18:59.370 --> 19:01.144
Okay.

19:01.250 --> 19:03.241
Let's drop him off.

21:51.670 --> 21:53.968
Charles De Gaulle, May 2016.

21:54.070 --> 21:56.015
That's Saeed Abu-Saeed.

21:56.120 --> 21:57.576
He's waiting for
a flight to Saudi.

21:57.680 --> 22:00.535
Abu-Saeed ran a chemical
weapons program for Saddam.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.369
Yeah, I know who he is, but...

22:02.480 --> 22:04.493
He's in Paris for two hours
on a layover.

22:04.600 --> 22:07.467
While he's waiting
for his flight, who stops by
to say hi?

22:07.570 --> 22:09.561
[keyboard clacks]

22:09.930 --> 22:12.364
-Is that Ammar Nazari?
-Yeah.

22:19.060 --> 22:22.359
How am I just now seeing this?

22:22.460 --> 22:25.202
Nazari's face wasn't
all over the news tIll now.

22:25.310 --> 22:27.198
IfI could have made
a list of the people

22:27.310 --> 22:30.165
who could make the device
we found on Nazari,

22:30.270 --> 22:32.568
Saeed Abu-Saeed would be
right at the top.

22:32.670 --> 22:35.195
Now wait for it.
There's the hand-off.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.429
[Manfredi] Looks like a book,
but who knows?

22:43.610 --> 22:45.601
This is not right.

22:46.330 --> 22:48.321
Which part?

22:48.650 --> 22:50.641
None of it.

22:58.660 --> 23:01.026

24:08.220 --> 24:10.211
Why is Sammy not sad?

24:11.380 --> 24:13.371
He is, buddy.

24:15.030 --> 24:17.362
I think...

24:17.470 --> 24:21.065
Sam Jr.'s just
taking his own time
to figure things out.

24:22.950 --> 24:24.952
He's not Sam Jr. anymore.

24:25.560 --> 24:26.731
What do you mean?

24:26.840 --> 24:28.831
Dad's gone, so he's just Sam.

24:35.050 --> 24:36.904
Hey, buddy, you guys left
the door open.

25:17.850 --> 25:18.987
Hi.

25:19.090 --> 25:21.149
I'm so sorry for what happened.

25:21.260 --> 25:23.251
Sam was such a special man.

Whenever Dan ’5 home
late this month,
I can barely breathe.

26:06.260 --> 26:08.262
I thought you wanted
to be with everyone.

26:09.150 --> 26:11.038
[Jude] I don't think so.

26:11.150 --> 26:13.004

26:13.110 --> 26:15.101
Okay.

26:18.480 --> 26:19.651
Who's coat is that?

26:19.760 --> 26:21.899
Mrs. Watermain's.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.991
What'd she bring?

26:24.880 --> 26:26.507
Ah...

26:26.610 --> 26:29.067
He famous schnitzel, I believe.

26:29.170 --> 26:31.638
What's schnitzel?

26:32.730 --> 26:34.732
It's a way to make chicken.

26:36.780 --> 26:38.771
You'll like it.

26:41.140 --> 26:43.700
Did anyone tell nice stories
about Dad?

26:47.310 --> 26:48.846
They thought they were nice.

26:48.950 --> 26:50.838
You didn't?

26:50.950 --> 26:52.941
Their hearts
were in the right place.

26:56.120 --> 26:58.714
It's just very hard to hear
those stories right now.

27:02.530 --> 27:05.021
Do you want to come out
and say hi to everybody?

27:05.130 --> 27:07.906
-No.
-No? Okay.

27:08.010 --> 27:10.706
I'm sorry for what
I said earlier about

27:10.810 --> 27:12.812
Sam Jr. no longer being

27:13.820 --> 27:15.674
Sam Jr. anymore.

27:15.780 --> 27:17.554
That's okay.

27:17.660 --> 27:19.651
I think I said it to hurt you.

27:22.070 --> 27:23.844
Oh.

27:23.950 --> 27:25.941
I don't know why.

27:26.790 --> 27:28.781
It's hard losing your dad.

27:29.950 --> 27:31.952
It's confusing.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.316
I lost mine
when I was In college.

27:37.960 --> 27:40.599
I can't even imagine what
it must be like for you.

27:42.170 --> 27:44.024
Am I going to be a fuck-up?

27:44.130 --> 27:46.507
No, why would you say that?

27:46.610 --> 27:49.955
Daddy always said Uncle Alan
was such a fuck-up

27:50.060 --> 27:53.097
'cause he was so young
when Grandpa Dave died.

27:55.900 --> 27:57.595

You...

28:00.390 --> 28:02.381

It's so nice to see you.
Thank you for coming.

29:09.940 --> 29:11.874
We all flew to Miami together.

29:11.980 --> 29:16.303
And Sam kept going on and on
about the stone crabs.

Would you excuse me?

29:57.590 --> 29:59.592
Hi, Mrs. Partridge.

-Quiche.
-Ham and cheese?

-Would you like some?
-I'm not hungry.

What about at night?

30:22.500 --> 30:24.491
Hmm.

30:25.140 --> 30:29.042
Mourning means
to miss someone
who's dead.

30:29.150 --> 30:31.141
Death involves a lot
of new words.

30:32.350 --> 30:34.341
That's true.

I don't think they'll let
my daddy into heaven.

30:46.610 --> 30:48.180
Why not?

30:48.290 --> 30:51.145
Daddy always said
God was bullshit,

30:51.250 --> 30:54.970
and it was a story people
told themselves to feel better.

where would you like
for your daddy to be?

had an older brother?

My dad said
he died in Vietnam.

31:59.240 --> 32:01.105
Yeah.

32:01.210 --> 32:03.622
When I was about your age.

32:03.730 --> 32:08.224
He and I were very close
and it hurt very much
when he died.

32:08.330 --> 32:10.469
[Joe] How did he die?

32:10.580 --> 32:12.912
He stepped on a land mine.

[Lily] You won't.

I've been trying
to remember his smell.

all of this suck?

I baked over the years,

were going through.

terrible about when
you came over the other day.

that much more than you do.

34:51.550 --> 34:53.984
-Only that...
-[Mae]
Only what?

34:56.720 --> 34:59.132
No matter how crazy
it sounds, or even
if you don't believe me,

34:59.240 --> 35:01.379
I need you to promise
to keep this between us.

35:01.480 --> 35:03.937
-For your safety
and for mine.
-I promIse.

35:04.040 --> 35:06.042
I promise.

35:10.530 --> 35:12.862
I already told you
Elden cheated on me.

35:12.970 --> 35:16.110
He went to counseling,
and he stopped.

35:16.220 --> 35:18.677
Things got better for a wh/le.

35:18.780 --> 35:21.032
And then he started acting
weird again.

35:21.140 --> 35:22.835
Going out at night.

35:22.940 --> 35:26.398
Gil/mg me lame excuses.
Telling me that I was paranoid
when I ’d confront h/m.

35:26.510 --> 35:27.841
Until one night,

35:27.950 --> 35:29.963
Elden went to walk the dog,

35:30.070 --> 35:32.447
so I followed him.

35:32.550 --> 35:35.439
And I assumed I would catch him
fucking some woman in her car.

35:38.760 --> 35:40.751
But instead of some woman,

35:41.720 --> 35:43.722
he met up with two men.

35:45.370 --> 35:47.349
One of them I didn't recognize.

35:47.450 --> 35:49.441
The other was Sam.

35:50.130 --> 35:51.859
Sam?

35:51.970 --> 35:53.972
They were threatening him.

35:55.020 --> 35:57.477
Sam was threatening Elden?

35:57.580 --> 35:59.571
I never saw Elden
so scared In my lIfe.

36:00.940 --> 36:02.521
What are you saying
right now?

36:02.630 --> 36:05.804
[Iris]
I went home .
and I wa/ted for h/m.
Hours passed.

36:05.910 --> 36:07.719
At 3:00 a. m., a car pulled
into the driveway.

36:07.830 --> 36:09.604
It was a state trooper.

36:09.710 --> 36:12.156
And he'd come to tell me
that Elden_was in
a car aCCIdent.

36:12.800 --> 36:14.654
That he was dead.

36:14.760 --> 36:16.569
And I told him

36:16.680 --> 36:20.184
that Elden had gone to take
the dog for a walk.
That he hadn't taken the car.

36:20.290 --> 36:22.565
And I went out
to the driveway to show him,
but the car was gone.

36:23.850 --> 36:25.659
Oh, God, Iris, no.

36:25.770 --> 36:27.499
No, he couldn't have.

36:27.610 --> 36:29.396
They were friends...

36:29.500 --> 36:33.118
They were friends.
He could not. What are you
saying right now?

36:33.220 --> 36:35.393
I have proof.

36:35.500 --> 36:36.558
[Mae]
What?

36:36.660 --> 36:38.389
-But we have to be careful--
-What kind of proof?

36:38.500 --> 36:39.762
What are you talking about?

36:39.870 --> 36:41.087
I don't want to say it.

36:41.190 --> 36:43.203
I think they're watching
my house.

36:43.310 --> 36:44.527
And they could be watching
your house, too.

36:44.630 --> 36:46.769
Mae.

36:46.870 --> 36:48.497
-[Li|y] Someone's here
to see you.
-Iris, please.

36:48.600 --> 36:51.330
Please, come on,
what are you--
You can't just say this.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.431
She's from the government.

36:54.640 --> 36:58.542
[Iris] I should go.
[Mae] Please, wait.
Wait, Iris.

36:58.650 --> 37:01.062
[Mae] Please,
just wait one second.

37:01.170 --> 37:03.365
-Iris.
-[Iris] No, I shouldn't
have said anything.

37:05.010 --> 37:07.012
You can't just go.

37:08.580 --> 37:10.957
I have a boat.

37:11.060 --> 37:13.790
Elden taught me that
it’s harder to hear at sea.

37:13.900 --> 37:16.482
I'm a good sailor. Why don't
we go out this weekend,
and I'll show you what I have.

37:16.590 --> 37:18.581
-Okay?
-Okay.

37:22.910 --> 37:24.901
-[Sharla] Mrs. Barber?
-[gasp5]

37:27.600 --> 37:30.330
I'm Special Agent
Sharla Shepard,
I'm with the FBI.

37:30.440 --> 37:31.577
-Hi.
-We're investigating--

37:31.680 --> 37:33.489
Who are you?

37:33.600 --> 37:35.147
Did you bring food?

37:35.250 --> 37:37.343
Come here, buddy.
Do you want to actually
just wait for me

37:37.450 --> 37:39.020
uh, downstairs,
in Sam's office?

37:39.130 --> 37:41.507
-It's just downstairs
on the left.
-Yeah. Great.

37:41.610 --> 37:43.544
Okay, thank you.

37:43.650 --> 37:45.709
Hey, how's it going?

37:45.820 --> 37:48.311
I want to go outside.

37:48.420 --> 37:50.411
-You want to go outside
and play?
-Yeah.

37:51.580 --> 37:53.866
[women chatting indistinctly]

38:00.150 --> 38:02.141
[laughter]

38:10.800 --> 38:12.802
[sighs]

38:28.260 --> 38:30.285
Did someone break in?

38:30.390 --> 38:32.381
No.

38:32.910 --> 38:34.901
No, this was me.

38:36.350 --> 38:39.615
I thought if you saw this room,
you'd understand
how little I know

38:39.720 --> 38:41.711
about what my husband
was doing.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.511
But you think
he was doing something?

38:45.360 --> 38:47.351
My husband was a spy.
[chuckles]

38:48.320 --> 38:50.663
They're always doing something.

38:50.770 --> 38:53.125
I mean something he wasn't
supposed to be doing.

38:55.570 --> 38:57.561
I don't know.

39:00.700 --> 39:02.691
Why'd you do this?

39:03.940 --> 39:07.137
-Hmm? Do you think
he left something behind?
-[sighs]

39:09.910 --> 39:11.901
No, I thought
maybe if he, uh...

39:13.430 --> 39:15.944
Maybe if he knew that
something might
happen to him that...

39:17.600 --> 39:19.591
Or maybe he left me
a note or something.

39:37.380 --> 39:39.575
Hey, I just lost someone
very close to me, too.

39:40.940 --> 39:42.931
So I have an idea what
you're going through.

39:43.740 --> 39:45.685
And I think

39:45.790 --> 39:49.328
when someone's lost to you,
all those questions that
you never asked,

39:58.560 --> 40:00.551
I'm still in denial.

40:02.560 --> 40:04.562
What phase of grief
are you in?

40:05.770 --> 40:07.761
Same.

40:11.570 --> 40:13.572
Thank you.

40:28.510 --> 40:31.650
Hey, Jude, it's all right.
Just...

40:31.760 --> 40:33.091
[shushing]

40:33.200 --> 40:34.974
-[screams]
-No, no, no, no, no!
Jude,Jude".

40:35.080 --> 40:37.071
-Oh, shit.
-Mom!

40:38.200 --> 40:40.191
[Jude] Help!

40:42.090 --> 40:44.081
[Jude] I saw him!

40:45.450 --> 40:46.587
[phone ringing]

40:46.690 --> 40:48.544
Help!

40:48.650 --> 40:51.369
Come here. Hey. Are you okay?

40:52.420 --> 40:54.411
It's okay.

41:01.910 --> 41:03.901
Come on.

41:04.430 --> 41:05.806
I have Turner's location.

41:05.910 --> 41:08.890
He ’5 not far from where
you are now.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.413
He's headed east along
Stapleton with a federal agent
in pursuit.

41:12.520 --> 41:14.636
-[Joubert] Who?
-5hepard.

41:30.540 --> 41:32.531
Shit.

41:35.660 --> 41:37.662
Shit, shit. ..

41:57.890 --> 41:59.881
[panﬁng]

42:01.290 --> 42:03.281
[grunts]

42:06.940 --> 42:08.669
[grunts]

42:08.780 --> 42:10.771
-Don't fucking move.
-[grunting]

42:11.260 --> 42:13.251
I have a gun. [grunts]

42:13.630 --> 42:15.848
[groaning]

42:15.950 --> 42:17.406
I didn't kill anyone.

42:17.510 --> 42:19.705
Lay flat on your stomach
with your hands out.

42:20.310 --> 42:22.301
[gasping]

42:23.320 --> 42:25.811
-I know you.
-Shut up! Face down.

42:25.920 --> 42:27.911
Sarah was my friend.

42:28.640 --> 42:30.449
The morning she died,
you, you had a fight.

42:30.560 --> 42:32.266
Uh, you were angry that
she couldn't tell her parents

42:32.370 --> 42:34.258
about being
in a relationship
with you.

42:34.370 --> 42:35.860
With a woman.

42:35.970 --> 42:37.779
She was terrified
you were gomg to leave her.

42:37.890 --> 42:39.778
[Joe panting]

42:39.890 --> 42:41.892
She loved you so much.

42:52.630 --> 42:54.621
There were two of them.

42:56.790 --> 42:58.781
-I didn't kill anyone.
-And Hale?

43:00.800 --> 43:02.256
Ferris, the operative who died.

43:02.360 --> 43:04.351
Yeah, they were killed
by the same woman.

43:05.200 --> 43:06.736
Woman?

43:06.840 --> 43:08.410
Yeah.

43:08.520 --> 43:09.862
Yeah.

43:09.970 --> 43:11.506
Her name is Joubert.

43:11.610 --> 43:13.601
[crying]

43:14.970 --> 43:16.961
Fuck.

43:35.910 --> 43:37.935
You got him?

43:38.040 --> 43:40.133
Obviously not.

43:40.240 --> 43:42.231
Why didn't you call it in?

43:43.240 --> 43:45.458
He had a head start,

43:45.560 --> 43:47.562
so I took after him.

43:51.210 --> 43:53.201
What are you looking at?

43:53.650 --> 43:55.789
Are you okay, Agent Shepard?

43:55.900 --> 43:57.549
-I'm fine_.
-You're actIng
a little strange.

43:57.660 --> 43:59.070
I'm, I...

43:59.180 --> 44:02.991
We have barely spoken,
so maybe this is just how I am.

44:03.100 --> 44:06.581
And you're talking to me
in an accusatory tone.

44:07.310 --> 44:09.562
So maybe that's it.

44:09.670 --> 44:11.399
[Joubert]
What would I accuse you of?

44:11.510 --> 44:13.501
[Sharla] I have no idea.

44:14.110 --> 44:16.112
-[sniffs]
-Okay.

44:16.920 --> 44:18.911
I'm acting a little strange?

44:19.840 --> 44:21.831
[sniffs]

44:24.050 --> 44:26.041
[softly] Jesus Christ.

44:31.450 --> 44:33.452
[starts engine]

44:45.470 --> 44:47.461
[sighs]

44:48.630 --> 44:50.643
[sighs in relief]

44:50.750 --> 44:53.275
[muezzin calling on speakers]

45:03.330 --> 45:06.083
[crowd chanting in Arabic]

45:21.950 --> 45:24.464
[prays in Arabic]

45:35.400 --> 45:37.960
[chanting continues]

45:48.260 --> 45:50.376
[theme music playing]
