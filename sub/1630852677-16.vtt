narrator: Previously on
"Resident Alien..."

00:03.220 --> 00:05.744
[dramatic music]

00:05.788 --> 00:07.224
- Real Harry killed Sam.

00:07.268 --> 00:09.270
- He was a bad man.

00:09.313 --> 00:10.880
- I'm producing a documentary

00:10.923 --> 00:13.317
where experiencers
share their stories.

00:13.361 --> 00:15.145
Would you be interested
in participating?

00:15.189 --> 00:17.060
- Oh, I couldn't.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.844
- There's a secret base
in Wyoming.

00:18.888 --> 00:21.108
If they took your alien baby,

00:21.151 --> 00:23.675
that's where it would be.

00:23.719 --> 00:25.025
No!

00:26.200 --> 00:29.507
Please, save my son.

00:29.551 --> 00:32.032
- [splutters]

00:33.381 --> 00:36.340
- All right, here we go.
Let's roll, please.

00:38.081 --> 00:39.387
- I'm Mike Richardson,

00:39.430 --> 00:42.520
and I'm CEO
of Dark Horse Media.

00:42.564 --> 00:45.001
I grew up in Milwaukie, Oregon,

00:45.045 --> 00:47.264
which is a suburb of Portland.

00:47.308 --> 00:50.050
Every neighborhood
in those days had a small,

00:50.093 --> 00:51.616
little neighborhood
grocery store,

00:51.660 --> 00:55.185
and my mom used to send me down
for nonessential things,

00:55.229 --> 00:56.708
like bread and milk,

00:56.752 --> 00:59.668
things that you just
picked up on the fly.

00:59.711 --> 01:03.063
My friend Duke lived
about two houses up Edison,

01:03.106 --> 01:05.152
on the opposite side
of the street.

01:05.195 --> 01:06.805
I hopped on my bike.
Duke joined me.

01:06.849 --> 01:10.113
And we rode down to the store,
which was located on 30th.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.289
On the way back,
at the bottom of 34th,

01:12.333 --> 01:14.117
we looked up in the sky,

01:14.161 --> 01:15.814
and there's this
big disc there,

01:15.858 --> 01:20.210
about the size of my first,
up in the sky.

01:20.254 --> 01:24.345
And it was perfectly round,
silent.

01:24.388 --> 01:27.609
The outside was spinning.
The center was stationary.

01:27.652 --> 01:31.395
It was probably up in the air
about 60 to 100 feet.

01:31.439 --> 01:34.311
And we just got off our bikes
and stood there

01:34.355 --> 01:35.573
and watched it for a while.

01:35.617 --> 01:37.401
You know,
I tend to be a skeptic.

01:37.445 --> 01:40.752
I need to find a logical reason
for these things.

01:40.796 --> 01:42.885
But this is something
I can't really explain.

01:42.928 --> 01:46.193
I don't--I have no idea
what it--what it was.

01:46.236 --> 01:47.411
I can only say what it is,

01:47.455 --> 01:48.847
and it seems to be consistent

01:48.891 --> 01:52.286
with our conception
of what a flying saucer is.

01:54.418 --> 01:57.421
[Brown Bird's "Bilgewater"]

01:57.465 --> 02:00.294
[laid-back acoustic strumming]

02:00.337 --> 02:04.776
â™ª

02:07.344 --> 02:11.479
- [chewing loudly]

02:11.522 --> 02:13.045
- What'd that thing
ever do to you?

02:13.089 --> 02:14.351
- [chuckles]

02:14.395 --> 02:15.613
- It's probably got a family,

02:15.657 --> 02:16.962
little baby sliders
running around,

02:17.006 --> 02:17.963
looking for their daddy.

02:18.007 --> 02:20.531
- [laughs]
Stop!

02:22.185 --> 02:24.405
You're gonna make me choke.

02:24.448 --> 02:26.494
Mm, I need to see Harry soon.

02:26.537 --> 02:30.237
He just got back from a, um...

02:30.280 --> 02:32.804
[dramatic music]

02:33.501 --> 02:35.067
Medical convention.

02:35.111 --> 02:37.331
- So did you take a look at
that apartment I sent to you?

02:37.374 --> 02:39.071
- It's tiny.

02:39.115 --> 02:40.334
- Hello, it's got a hot tub.

02:40.377 --> 02:41.813
- Yeah, and no bedrooms,

02:41.857 --> 02:43.598
with, like, a pullout couch
and a wooden chair.

02:43.641 --> 02:46.731
- And a floor.
- Okay.

02:46.775 --> 02:48.168
Oh, shit.

02:48.211 --> 02:49.517
God, I thought
she wasn't working today.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.822
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

02:50.866 --> 02:52.694
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:52.737 --> 02:54.565
- Sup, Cheese?

02:54.609 --> 02:57.351
- So I just found out that
I'm a few credits short

02:57.394 --> 02:59.179
for my science elective.

02:59.222 --> 03:01.093
And I was--I was wondering

03:01.137 --> 03:05.359
if I could maybe have
my old job at the clinic back.

03:05.402 --> 03:08.449
- Yeah, sure.

03:08.492 --> 03:11.495
We could use the help.
You could start right away.

03:11.539 --> 03:14.759
- Okay.
I'll see you later, Cheese.

03:14.803 --> 03:17.588
- See ya.
- See ya.

03:18.807 --> 03:21.244
- Cheese?
- It's a long story.

03:21.288 --> 03:22.767
Got nothing to do with cheese.
- Hmm.

03:22.811 --> 03:24.726
[phone chimes]

03:25.901 --> 03:27.468
- Mm, just Harry,

03:27.511 --> 03:29.557
eager to tell me about
the medical convention.

03:31.472 --> 03:35.084
[phone chiming repeatedly]

03:35.127 --> 03:37.391
Oh, excuse me.

03:39.567 --> 03:42.265
Gosh, he is just
really excited about medicine.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.658
[laughs]

03:43.701 --> 03:45.747
[sighs]

03:47.270 --> 03:48.445
- First,
you need to know that

03:48.489 --> 03:50.317
our people are not coming
to kill everyone.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.057
- Why are they not coming?

03:52.101 --> 03:53.363
- Because it's too dangerous.

03:53.407 --> 03:54.669
There is an alien race

03:54.712 --> 03:56.192
that's planning
to take over the Earth.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.280
They're here, Harry.

03:57.324 --> 03:58.586
- What alien race?

03:58.629 --> 04:01.110
- You must be careful.

04:01.153 --> 04:02.720
It's the Greys.

04:02.764 --> 04:03.982
They've learned
how to live on this planet,

04:04.026 --> 04:05.723
and they have
mastered hybridization.

04:05.767 --> 04:09.292
There are Grey human hybrids
all over the Earth.

04:09.336 --> 04:11.076
And they're planning on
taking over,

04:11.120 --> 04:13.122
and they will succeed.

04:13.165 --> 04:14.732
I was there.

04:14.776 --> 04:17.039
I failed to protect the Earth,

04:17.082 --> 04:19.520
and I watched it die.

04:19.563 --> 04:22.000
And there is only one person
who may have the resources

04:22.044 --> 04:23.872
to stop the Greys,

04:23.915 --> 04:27.876
an Air Force general
named Eleanor McCallister.

04:27.919 --> 04:29.443
But I killed her.

04:29.486 --> 04:33.316
Do not make the same mistake.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.362
She may be Earth's only hope.

04:35.405 --> 04:38.930
[dramatic music]

04:38.974 --> 04:40.105
Oh.

04:40.149 --> 04:42.325
Also, I'm you from the future.

04:42.369 --> 04:45.154
This is some crazy shit.

04:45.197 --> 04:47.461
[loud pulse]

04:47.504 --> 04:49.637
- [chittering]

04:51.247 --> 04:54.032
- [groans]

04:54.076 --> 04:56.470
[sighs]
- [chittering]

04:56.513 --> 04:59.951
- Do all alien babies
on your planet do this?

04:59.995 --> 05:01.431
- No.

05:01.475 --> 05:04.782
My Moesha is special.

05:04.826 --> 05:06.262
- Moesha?

05:06.306 --> 05:07.611
- You don't like it?

05:07.655 --> 05:10.353
I'm trying out names.

05:10.397 --> 05:12.312
Brad.

05:12.355 --> 05:13.748
Hey!

05:13.791 --> 05:16.707
Do not drink the toilet water,
Jebidiah!

05:16.751 --> 05:18.666
- Okay, what did Goliath say?

05:18.709 --> 05:21.321
Hybridized half-Grey,
half-human?

05:21.364 --> 05:25.542
- The Greys,
they are too spindly

05:25.586 --> 05:27.849
to spend too much time
in Earth's atmosphere.

05:27.892 --> 05:32.375
So developing hybrids
to take over the Earth,

05:32.419 --> 05:33.811
that makes sense.

05:33.855 --> 05:35.552
- At least tell me
you didn't kill that general.

05:35.596 --> 05:37.859
- No, I got
the message in time.

05:37.902 --> 05:40.165
[water splashing]
I can hear you drinking!

05:40.209 --> 05:41.471
I did not kill her.

05:41.515 --> 05:43.473
- Good. At least there's hope.

05:43.517 --> 05:44.996
Um, okay,
now we could work with her,

05:45.040 --> 05:47.390
and then you could get rid
of these Grey things.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.697
- I will not work with her.
She is my enemy.

05:49.740 --> 05:54.092
You heard Goliath.
He tried to stop the Greys.

05:54.136 --> 05:56.225
He failed. He is me.

05:56.268 --> 05:59.359
So if I try, I will fail.

05:59.402 --> 06:01.012
- You are not a failure.

06:01.056 --> 06:03.058
You have to do something.

06:03.101 --> 06:05.103
You can't just
let the Grey aliens

06:05.147 --> 06:07.149
take over the Earth.

06:07.192 --> 06:10.370
- It is worse than failure.
It is future failure.

06:10.413 --> 06:12.937
It is guaranteed.

06:14.286 --> 06:17.899
- Well, I'll never get
that image out of my head.

06:17.942 --> 06:19.988
Okay, you're not gonna help
the general save the world?

06:20.031 --> 06:22.817
Then what?
What are you going to do?

06:22.860 --> 06:25.776
- I will do what
human failures do.

06:25.820 --> 06:28.126
I will ignore my horrible life

06:28.170 --> 06:30.041
by being a parent

06:30.085 --> 06:34.394
and passing my resentments
on to my children.

06:34.437 --> 06:37.135
- "Children"?
[door creaks open]

06:37.179 --> 06:39.964
- Can you keep it down?
I am sleeping.

06:40.008 --> 06:42.663
- I adopted the Alien Tracker's
son, Robert.

06:42.706 --> 06:46.014
- [sighs]
- Oh, do not slam that door!

06:46.057 --> 06:48.756
You are not sleeping
this day away!

06:48.799 --> 06:50.758
I'm signing you up
for soccer practice.

06:50.801 --> 06:52.368
- [sighs]

06:52.412 --> 06:54.762
[knocking at door]
- Hey.

06:54.805 --> 06:56.198
- Hey, I know new budget's
going in soon,

06:56.241 --> 06:58.548
so I came by to see if
there were any updates

06:58.592 --> 07:00.594
on my requests.

07:00.637 --> 07:04.554
- Requests, yes.
Let's see here, new pens.

07:04.598 --> 07:06.382
Well, that's not it.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.514
Oh, here it is.

07:07.557 --> 07:10.038
Eight additional deputies,

07:10.081 --> 07:11.692
four more patrol cars,

07:11.735 --> 07:16.436
and body cams for everyone,
including Cletus.

07:16.479 --> 07:17.654
- Well, of course Cletus,

07:17.698 --> 07:19.134
'cause you know
he got a temper on him,

07:19.177 --> 07:20.527
so it he roughs somebody up,
we need to know about it.

07:20.570 --> 07:22.877
- Seems like a lot.
- This is the bare minimum.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.487
Hell, when we get
that resort built,

07:24.531 --> 07:26.576
we gonna need a new prison
just for the prostitutes alone.

07:26.620 --> 07:28.404
As a matter of fact,
go ahead and put

07:28.448 --> 07:30.232
"hooker jail"
on that list for me.

07:30.275 --> 07:31.538
Although, to be honest,

07:31.581 --> 07:32.800
I'm not sure if that's
the proper term anymore.

07:32.843 --> 07:34.715
It's probably
"sex worker jail."

07:34.758 --> 07:36.717
You can put that down there
'cause you know hookers,

07:36.760 --> 07:38.501
they love to use
that modern terminology.

07:38.545 --> 07:40.503
And I want to be
as respectful as I can

07:40.547 --> 07:42.549
to all them hard-working hoes
out there.

07:42.592 --> 07:45.552
- Look, about the resort.

07:45.595 --> 07:47.510
I'm no longer gonna support it.

07:47.554 --> 07:50.295
[soft music]

07:50.339 --> 07:56.650
- [muttering gibberish]

08:00.610 --> 08:02.656
[chuckles]

08:02.699 --> 08:06.181
[muttering gibberish]

08:09.053 --> 08:10.054
What?

08:10.098 --> 08:13.493
- I think
I was just so caught up

08:13.536 --> 08:16.974
in trying to rebrand Patience
away from being a murder town

08:17.018 --> 08:21.544
that I...
forgot how much I love it.

08:21.588 --> 08:24.547
I don't want it to change.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.810
Look, I don't expect you
to understand.

08:26.854 --> 08:28.551
- I understand,
if we don't get this resort,

08:28.595 --> 08:29.987
there's gonna be riots, okay?

08:30.031 --> 08:32.990
So now I need 30 officers.
I need nine cars.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.731
And I need a damn tank.
- Okay.

08:34.775 --> 08:38.996
Well, I can give you
one more deputy and...

08:41.869 --> 08:44.088
this Hot Wheels car
Max left in my office.

08:46.874 --> 08:48.179
- You got one of them
loop-de-loop things

08:48.223 --> 08:49.354
for it to go on,
but you gotta make sure

08:49.398 --> 08:50.442
it goes fast enough or else

08:50.486 --> 08:51.661
it don't get past
the loop-de-loop?

08:51.705 --> 08:53.097
- I can bring you
one from home.

08:53.141 --> 08:55.012
- I'll take it.

08:55.056 --> 08:57.014
- I discovered
my breastfeeding bra

08:57.058 --> 08:59.190
did not work
for feeding the baby.

08:59.234 --> 09:01.671
I kept draining
the teats myself.

09:01.715 --> 09:02.890
- Ten hamburgers.

09:02.933 --> 09:04.544
Hope the monster baby's hungry.

09:04.587 --> 09:07.677
[fly buzzing]

09:17.557 --> 09:20.908

[soft dramatic music]

09:24.128 --> 09:31.048
â™ª

09:53.375 --> 09:55.420
- Hello, Harry.

09:55.464 --> 09:56.552
My name is Joseph.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.510
- I do not care.
You are a Grey.

09:58.554 --> 10:00.338
I will call you "Dickhead."

10:00.382 --> 10:01.644
- We may be enemies,

10:01.688 --> 10:03.515
but I think we can be
professional about this.

10:03.559 --> 10:06.388
- I know you are,
but what am I?

10:06.431 --> 10:08.608
- What?
- [chuckles]

10:08.651 --> 10:10.784
- We've made a deal
with your people.

10:10.827 --> 10:13.830
They have conceded
the Earth to us.

10:13.874 --> 10:16.093
We get the planet,
we let you go home.

10:16.137 --> 10:17.660
There's an escape pod
up on the mountain for you.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.183
It will take you
to your planet.

10:19.227 --> 10:21.838
I'll text you the coordinates.
You can be on your way.

10:21.882 --> 10:23.710
- I do not like to give out
my phone number.

10:23.753 --> 10:25.712
- We already have it.

10:25.755 --> 10:27.627
- The Greys have
my phone number?

10:27.670 --> 10:29.498
How did you get it?
- I don't know.

10:29.541 --> 10:31.326
Probably the phone company.
- That is impossible.

10:31.369 --> 10:33.981
They do not give away
that information.

10:34.024 --> 10:35.635
- Grey aliens
are pretty powerful.

10:35.678 --> 10:38.420
- Not powerful enough
to get somebody's phone number

10:38.463 --> 10:40.944
from the phone number company
unless they say,

10:40.988 --> 10:43.599
"Yeah, okay,
give them my phone number."

10:43.643 --> 10:46.123
- I think we are.
- I do not like it.

10:46.167 --> 10:47.951
- Well, I'm texting you anyway.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.910
- Do not do it.
Just write it down.

10:49.953 --> 10:51.999
- I don't have a pen.

10:53.435 --> 10:55.306
- Fine. Text it.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.918
You do not share my number,
do you?

10:57.961 --> 10:59.963
'Cause I do not want
all those spam calls.

11:00.007 --> 11:01.399
- I don't think we do that.

11:01.443 --> 11:03.706
- Okay, good, 'cause--

11:03.750 --> 11:05.752
good.

11:05.795 --> 11:07.275
I still do not think
that the phone company

11:07.318 --> 11:08.406
gave you my phone number.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.321
- Okay, fine,
I went to your clinic

11:10.365 --> 11:11.845
and pretended
I was one of your patients.

11:11.888 --> 11:14.848
One of your nurses
gave me your number.

11:14.891 --> 11:17.328
- Ellen?
- Yeah, that sounds right.

11:17.372 --> 11:19.287
- That one? Her? Her?

11:19.330 --> 11:20.375
- Yeah, that's her.

11:20.418 --> 11:22.029
- God! She's the worst.

11:22.072 --> 11:25.119
She is horrible.
She steals food from my office!

11:25.162 --> 11:26.729
- Why don't you just
lock your door?

11:26.773 --> 11:28.600
- Because then
it's complicated.

11:28.644 --> 11:30.820
It's--I have to carry a key.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.256
- I get that.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.258
- You fall on your keys
one time,

11:34.302 --> 11:36.304
and you start
making different plans.

11:36.347 --> 11:38.175
- Well, there you go.

11:38.219 --> 11:39.786
[phone chimes]
Good luck.

11:39.829 --> 11:42.005
- Dickhead says "what?"

11:42.049 --> 11:43.746
- What?
- Chicken butt.

11:43.790 --> 11:47.619
[chuckles]

11:47.663 --> 11:49.534
- [whispering]
Jackass.

11:49.578 --> 11:55.715
â™ª

11:55.758 --> 11:58.369
I can go home.

12:10.512 --> 12:12.383
I'm not paying for this food!

12:12.427 --> 12:14.995
There's a fly in my pie!

12:15.038 --> 12:18.215
[upbeat music]

12:18.259 --> 12:20.391
â™ª

12:20.435 --> 12:23.786
How does it feel?

12:23.830 --> 12:25.266
- [chuckles]

12:28.486 --> 12:30.793
- So I know you've had
many encounters.

12:30.837 --> 12:33.796
I understand you were able
to record one of them?

12:33.840 --> 12:37.974
- There was one time that
I did record the encounter.

12:38.018 --> 12:41.195
It was actually just recently,
New Year's Eve.

12:41.238 --> 12:46.330
So this was right
over top of the ocean.

12:46.374 --> 12:49.246
The new year had just
kicked off, midnight,

12:49.290 --> 12:51.858
and there were
two floating orbs

12:51.901 --> 12:53.294
right over top of the city.

12:53.337 --> 12:59.082
When we...zoom in on these,

12:59.126 --> 13:02.738
you can actually see
that they are changing shape.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.522
Anytime you look up
to the skies,

13:04.566 --> 13:05.697
there's stuff going on there

13:05.741 --> 13:07.787
if you really look hard enough.

13:09.310 --> 13:11.268
- This base has been
compromised.

13:11.312 --> 13:13.531
We're moving everything
to Farmington 5.

13:13.575 --> 13:16.143
- That base hasn't been
used in years.

13:16.186 --> 13:19.146
- Then we'll have
plenty of room.

13:19.189 --> 13:21.017
- Yes, ma'am.

13:21.061 --> 13:23.498
There's something else.

13:23.541 --> 13:26.544
They may have had some help
on the inside too.

13:28.764 --> 13:32.637
He went straight for the safe.

13:32.681 --> 13:34.988
Every guard is accounted for
after the breach,

13:35.031 --> 13:36.337
except for that one.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.165
- Well, looks like
we have our mole.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.428
Find him.

13:40.471 --> 13:42.996
And bring me
Peter Bach's hard drive.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.867
- I can't.

13:44.911 --> 13:46.303
It's gone.

13:46.347 --> 13:49.654
- [sighs]

13:49.698 --> 13:52.919
That information is
fully encrypted.

13:52.962 --> 13:56.879
If anyone so much as plugs in
that drive, we'll know it.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.359
And when they do,

13:58.402 --> 14:01.841
I want you to grab everyone
within 200 yards of it.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.799
- Yes, ma'am.

14:05.932 --> 14:08.456
- Cunningham says he hikes
this canyon every morning.

14:08.499 --> 14:09.936
- Hey, been getting
some complaints

14:09.979 --> 14:11.415
about a suspicious black van

14:11.459 --> 14:12.895
parked on the sidewalk
downtown.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.984
- The vehicle was
still smoldering.

14:15.028 --> 14:16.464
- You all right there, Deputy?

14:16.507 --> 14:19.510
- It's in that spot that
the SUV went off the road.

14:19.554 --> 14:22.122
Authorities said
the driver lost control,

14:22.165 --> 14:23.732
sending him over the edge.

14:23.775 --> 14:26.039
The driver died
in the ensuing fire.

14:26.082 --> 14:28.302
The name of the deceased
has been released,

14:28.345 --> 14:30.870
a man named Peter Bach.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.784
Back to you.

14:32.828 --> 14:34.874
- Oh. Oh, no.

14:34.917 --> 14:39.443
Deputy, I'm--I'm sorry.
That's terrible.

14:39.487 --> 14:41.837
- I knew he was onto something.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.795
He got too close.
They killed him.

14:43.839 --> 14:45.362
- Wait, wait.
Hold on, Deputy.

14:45.406 --> 14:47.451
Now, this is just
a car accident.

14:47.495 --> 14:51.542
- It was no accident.
He was murdered.

14:51.586 --> 14:54.719
Where did you say
that abandoned van was?

14:56.112 --> 14:58.027
I knew it.

14:58.071 --> 15:01.770
This is Peter Bach's van.
The keys are still in it.

15:01.813 --> 15:04.947
- Doesn't mean something
shady was going on.

15:04.991 --> 15:07.123
- It doesn't make sense.

15:07.167 --> 15:08.864
I checked CCTV from the bank

15:08.908 --> 15:11.084
and saw Peter drive
this exact van

15:11.127 --> 15:12.737
out of town last night.

15:12.781 --> 15:15.915
Then he dies in an SUV
and the van ends up back here?

15:15.958 --> 15:18.526
It's very shady.

15:18.569 --> 15:20.354
- You know, there's an old
saying about a turtle.

15:20.397 --> 15:21.964
- Of course there is.

15:22.008 --> 15:24.706
- It goes, "if you want to read
something into a situation,

15:24.749 --> 15:27.752
it will become
whatever you want it to be."

15:27.796 --> 15:29.624
- What does that have to do
with a turtle?

15:31.495 --> 15:32.844
- I don't know.
I forget the turtle part.

15:32.888 --> 15:34.803
But the point is,
is that you tend to,

15:34.846 --> 15:37.023
you know, believe in
a bunch of conspiracy theories.

15:37.066 --> 15:39.808
- You're the one who says
the moon is manmade.

15:39.851 --> 15:41.505
- That's not a theory.
That's a fact.

15:41.549 --> 15:43.203
I mean, each crater's
the same depth.

15:43.246 --> 15:44.987
The damn thing rings
like a gong when you hit it.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.510
You can't even see
the other side.

15:46.554 --> 15:47.859
Shit, they probably got
an Arby's over there.

15:47.903 --> 15:50.950
Maybe even a strip club,
full with moon titties.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.516
- You're right.

15:52.560 --> 15:55.911
Probably all in my head
for, you know, this bit.

15:57.739 --> 16:00.133
Why don't you go
and do the next call,

16:00.176 --> 16:02.048
and I'll wait here for Ernie

16:02.091 --> 16:04.267
and make sure
this gets to the tow yard?

16:04.311 --> 16:05.747
- It's a solid plan, Deputy.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.967
- Thank you, sir.
- Divide and conquer.

16:09.359 --> 16:12.058
That is a shit ton of drywall.

16:12.101 --> 16:14.799
[soft quirky music]

16:14.843 --> 16:16.584
Divide and conquer, Deputy.

16:16.627 --> 16:23.765
â™ª

16:34.558 --> 16:38.475
- You are going to love
my home planet.

16:38.519 --> 16:40.347
Unfortunately,
you are too old to be tested

16:40.390 --> 16:42.653
in the punishing
ice wind desert.

16:42.697 --> 16:46.048
But we can take a field trip,

16:46.092 --> 16:49.791
and I can bury you
up to your neck in the dirt

16:49.834 --> 16:51.749
and kick you in the head.

16:51.793 --> 16:53.925
Rip off your eyelids.

16:53.969 --> 16:56.102
- They grow back.
They grow back.

16:58.452 --> 16:59.931
Son!

16:59.975 --> 17:04.240
We need to have
a family meeting.

17:04.284 --> 17:05.763
- I'm not your son,

17:05.807 --> 17:08.766
and I am not part
of your family.

17:08.810 --> 17:10.855
- I read that young boys
can be difficult.

17:10.899 --> 17:11.987
- I'm 28.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.990
- I'm gonna put you
in a timeout.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.035
Okay?

17:18.602 --> 17:21.257
I've been offered
an exciting new opportunity,

17:21.301 --> 17:22.737
so we are moving.

17:22.780 --> 17:26.436
I am bringing you and Merle
to my home planet.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.177
You will like my planet.

17:28.221 --> 17:30.223
We do not have soccer,
but we have a game

17:30.266 --> 17:33.487
that is like football.

17:33.530 --> 17:35.576
But there's no ball.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.491
And you cannot use your feet.

17:38.840 --> 17:42.017
It's fighting to the death.
[cackles]

17:42.061 --> 17:43.149
So fun.

17:43.192 --> 17:44.802
You know what?
You can use your feet.

17:44.846 --> 17:46.239
- I'm not going
anywhere with you.

17:46.282 --> 17:49.068
I need to--
I need to go back to my life.

17:49.111 --> 17:51.113
- You have no life.

17:51.157 --> 17:54.595
You would not have clothes
if I did not buy them for you.

17:54.638 --> 17:57.511
- You stole them out
of a Goodwill dumpster.

17:57.554 --> 17:59.208
- I threw in a dollar.

17:59.252 --> 18:01.515
- Look, thank you

18:01.558 --> 18:02.646
for getting me
out of that prison,

18:02.690 --> 18:05.432
but I--I have to go.

18:05.475 --> 18:07.129
- Wait.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.435
If you are leaving,

18:08.478 --> 18:11.133
I have something
I have to give to you.

18:12.395 --> 18:14.136
[dramatic music]

18:14.180 --> 18:15.616
- What is it?

18:15.659 --> 18:18.009
- I promised your father
I would protect you.

18:18.053 --> 18:20.011
This is technology
from my planet

18:20.055 --> 18:23.450
that I no longer need
because I am leaving.

18:23.493 --> 18:25.234
â™ª

18:25.278 --> 18:26.627
- What does it do?

18:26.670 --> 18:28.803
- Humans cannot control
the energy,

18:28.846 --> 18:32.285
but it will
keep you from dying.

18:32.328 --> 18:37.028
It also keeps hot drinks hot.

18:37.072 --> 18:40.510
â™ª

18:40.554 --> 18:42.338
- Let me just paint the scene.

18:42.382 --> 18:45.689
Um, we have a balcony
that's south-facing.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.474
And all of a sudden,

18:47.517 --> 18:48.866
there's a blackout
in our building.

18:48.910 --> 18:51.042
I step outside on my balcony,

18:51.086 --> 18:53.306
and all of a sudden,
out of the corner of my eye,

18:53.349 --> 18:58.963
I see these three dots
of white-ish, yellow lights,

18:59.007 --> 19:01.749
zooming along
in a triangle formation.

19:01.792 --> 19:04.186
There's no sound whatsoever.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.884
Entire thing was
about three, four seconds.

19:06.928 --> 19:10.801
I see this thing,
after the blackout happens.

19:10.845 --> 19:12.151
Is that what caused it?

19:12.194 --> 19:14.153
I don't know.
But it freaked me out.

19:14.196 --> 19:16.067
That incident
really spooked me out.

You okay?

â™ª

19:45.793 --> 19:47.795
What are you doing?

Oh.

19:51.799 --> 19:53.801
Why am I in the kitchen?

19:53.844 --> 19:55.629
- Oh, honey,

19:55.672 --> 19:57.413
you were sleepwalking again.

19:57.457 --> 19:59.415
- Oh, my God, that is so weird.

19:59.459 --> 20:02.157
I was having
that same dream again.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.072
I was in bed.

20:04.115 --> 20:05.595
My whole family was there.

20:08.076 --> 20:10.992
And now, suddenly, I'm here.
[chuckles weakly]

20:18.521 --> 20:19.957
Come to bed.

Hello, stink!

are getting lazy.

20:30.185 --> 20:33.275
- Listen, I--

20:33.319 --> 20:35.234
I drew a picture
of myself for you,

20:35.277 --> 20:38.411
since you've never seen
what I look like as a human.

20:40.674 --> 20:43.720
- This is what you look like?
- Yes.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.287
It is a perfect likeness.

20:45.331 --> 20:49.422
Are you impressed
with my skill?

20:50.727 --> 20:52.773
- Uh, yeah.

20:52.816 --> 20:55.906
You know, you don't usually
give me gifts.

20:55.950 --> 20:58.431
Except for that hunting T-shirt
with the bullseye on it.

20:58.474 --> 21:02.739
- I am doing what humans call
a goodbye tour.

21:02.783 --> 21:08.397
Me and the alien baby are
going home to my planet.

21:08.441 --> 21:11.139
And we are leaving here
forever.

21:11.182 --> 21:12.401
- No, you're not.

21:12.445 --> 21:14.142
You care about me
way too much to leave.

21:14.185 --> 21:17.188
- [chuckles]
What? I do not!

21:17.232 --> 21:19.408
- You just drew me a picture.

21:19.452 --> 21:21.236
You only do that
for someone you love.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.761
- I only drew that
because I'm an artist

21:24.805 --> 21:28.722
and I want to share my gift
with the world.

21:28.765 --> 21:30.680
- You drew a stick figure.

21:30.724 --> 21:32.465
This looks nothing like you.

21:32.508 --> 21:34.336
- How dare you body shame me.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.120
That is my goal weight.

21:36.164 --> 21:37.861
Are you saying I'm fat?

21:37.905 --> 21:39.167
- Whatever.

21:39.210 --> 21:41.996
I gotta go home. See you soon.

21:42.039 --> 21:44.215
- I will see you never!

21:44.259 --> 21:48.176
I am not fat. I am thick.

21:48.219 --> 21:50.352
All bodies are beautiful,

21:50.396 --> 21:53.616
except yours,
you squirrel-necked dick.

21:54.138 --> 21:56.358
- Funny story.
Ernie just called.

21:56.402 --> 21:57.664
He said he came
to pick up the van,

21:57.707 --> 21:59.753
but when he got there,
it wasn't there.

21:59.796 --> 22:02.495
And neither were you.

22:02.538 --> 22:04.018
- Oh, right!

22:04.061 --> 22:05.889
The other guy
came to pick it up.

22:05.933 --> 22:07.543
Ned, I think?

22:07.587 --> 22:10.677
And he was gonna drop me
straight here,

22:10.720 --> 22:13.767
but then we ended up
getting a burger.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.726
And then he thought
it was a date,

22:16.770 --> 22:18.772
so I told him I was married,

22:18.815 --> 22:20.382
and he said so is he.

22:20.426 --> 22:23.951
And, um, the thing is,
his wife Madeline has this

22:23.994 --> 22:25.561
don't-ask-don't-tell policy

22:25.605 --> 22:29.739
ever since she made out with
her college roommate Heather

22:29.783 --> 22:32.351
at their 15th reunion.

22:33.743 --> 22:34.831
They went to Brandeis.

22:34.875 --> 22:37.747
- Your lies have
gotten very specific.

22:40.707 --> 22:41.795
- Fine, I took it.

22:41.838 --> 22:43.231
- I'm sorry,
you say you took the van?

22:43.274 --> 22:45.320
You mean you stole the van.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.235
- Yep.
- You're an officer of the law.

22:47.278 --> 22:48.976
- His death was no accident.

22:49.019 --> 22:50.456
The van is safe in my garage.

22:50.499 --> 22:52.240
- Listen to me,
I want you to get that van

22:52.283 --> 22:54.242
to the impound immediately.

22:54.285 --> 22:56.113
Impound immediately, Deputy.

22:56.157 --> 22:57.811
- You know what?
This is what you do.

22:57.854 --> 22:59.116
Your dad even said.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.553
You run away from everything

23:00.596 --> 23:02.119
that takes you
out of your comfort zone.

23:02.163 --> 23:03.860
- I'm trying to be your friend.

23:03.904 --> 23:07.821
- A real friend would trust me
and have my back.

23:07.864 --> 23:09.562
I'm keeping the van.

23:09.605 --> 23:11.259
- Wh--no, no, no, no,
wait, wait, no.

23:11.302 --> 23:12.956
A real friend wouldn't make
their friends

23:13.000 --> 23:14.262
come visit them in jail

23:14.305 --> 23:15.742
and they have to go through
a cavity search

23:15.785 --> 23:17.613
to make sure they don't have
a knife up their ass

23:17.657 --> 23:19.180
to try to break you
out of there.

23:19.223 --> 23:20.486
And everybody knows
a knife in the ass

23:20.529 --> 23:23.140
can feel a little slice-y.

23:23.184 --> 23:24.751
- Well, I think I, like,

23:24.794 --> 23:27.101
kind of jokingly posted
on Facebook, like,

23:27.144 --> 23:31.148
"We went camping this weekend,
and we may have seen a UFO."

23:31.192 --> 23:34.064
- 'Cause at first, we're trying
to play process of elimination,

23:34.108 --> 23:35.718
'cause it could have been
a plane, it could have been--

23:35.762 --> 23:38.155
but its movement was just
way too erratic.

23:38.199 --> 23:39.461
- It couldn't have been
those things.

23:39.505 --> 23:40.897
So it just, like,
kind of looked like

23:40.941 --> 23:43.073
that bright white-ish light.

23:43.117 --> 23:47.121
The mountain ridge was, like,
there, and it was, like--

23:47.164 --> 23:48.383
- This is an alien.

23:48.427 --> 23:49.950
And therefore,
don't look at it.

23:49.993 --> 23:51.125
Don't take your phone out

23:51.168 --> 23:52.431
'cause they're gonna
come get you.

23:52.474 --> 23:53.475
- Come get us.
They're gonna take our phones.

23:53.519 --> 23:54.433
- Yeah.
[both chuckle]

23:54.476 --> 23:55.521
- And then it got weird.

23:59.699 --> 24:01.483
- Hello, Asta!

24:01.527 --> 24:03.485
If you are watching this
right now,

24:03.529 --> 24:06.532
then I'm already in space.

24:06.575 --> 24:08.664
I definitely said
goodbye to you,

24:08.708 --> 24:11.058
but you probably
did not hear me

24:11.101 --> 24:15.628
because you were reading
a dresses magazine.

24:15.671 --> 24:18.979
[knocking on door]

24:21.982 --> 24:23.940
- Max told me you have Baby.

24:23.984 --> 24:27.117
- "Baby"?
No, his name is Chaz.

24:29.032 --> 24:31.557
- Baby!

24:31.600 --> 24:33.341
I thought
I'd never see you again.

24:33.384 --> 24:35.604
- Thank. You.

24:35.648 --> 24:37.258
You help me.

24:37.301 --> 24:39.826
- You helped me.

24:39.869 --> 24:41.523
I didn't think
I'd be able to raise

24:41.567 --> 24:44.265
a human hybrid alien baby
toddler boy,

24:44.308 --> 24:46.180
but I did.

24:46.223 --> 24:48.574
I feel like
I'm a different person

24:48.617 --> 24:50.314
since I met you.

24:50.358 --> 24:52.360
- Oh, look, this door is open.

24:52.403 --> 24:54.014
It's good
for going out of houses.

24:55.798 --> 24:58.671
- I know you're going
on a long trip.

24:58.714 --> 25:01.064
I got you this.

25:01.108 --> 25:04.633
I stitched a hijab on her head
so you will remember me.

25:04.677 --> 25:05.982
[soft music]

25:06.026 --> 25:09.029
And I got you healthy snacks.

25:09.072 --> 25:10.334
Remember,

25:10.378 --> 25:14.208
eating live birds is bad
for your cholesterol.

25:14.251 --> 25:16.384
Goodbye, Baby.

25:16.427 --> 25:17.777
- Goodbye, Mama.

25:17.820 --> 25:20.301
â™ª

25:20.344 --> 25:21.694
- My people always thought

25:21.737 --> 25:23.565
that modern humans
hated aliens

25:23.609 --> 25:26.046
and saw them as their enemy.

25:26.089 --> 25:28.570
It appears that Asta
is not the only human

25:28.614 --> 25:32.052
who can care about a being
so different from themselves.

25:32.095 --> 25:35.272
- And I got snacks
for you too.

25:36.665 --> 25:39.102
You can't name him Chaz.

25:39.146 --> 25:41.148
He is significant.

25:41.191 --> 25:43.280
Extraordinary.

25:43.324 --> 25:47.981
He is the bridge
between your people and mine.

25:48.024 --> 25:50.636
And his name
should reflect that.

25:50.679 --> 25:57.817
â™ª

26:01.777 --> 26:05.085
- I will name you...

26:05.128 --> 26:08.262
"Bridget."

26:08.305 --> 26:10.307
Come to Papa, Bridget.

26:10.351 --> 26:17.010
â™ª

26:17.053 --> 26:18.925
Now go take off
this monkey suit.

26:18.968 --> 26:22.189
You look stupid.
[chuckles]

26:25.192 --> 26:26.889
[siren chirps]

26:33.679 --> 26:34.854
- Are you Olivia Baker?

26:34.897 --> 26:36.246
- Yeah, that's me.

26:36.290 --> 26:37.987
- We're looking
for a stolen van.

26:38.031 --> 26:39.946
We've been asking around,
and one of your neighbors

26:39.989 --> 26:42.122
said they saw you driving
a van into your garage.

26:42.165 --> 26:45.038
- Oh, well,
my neighbors are liars,

26:45.081 --> 26:47.954
and they throw their dog poop
in my garbage can.

26:47.997 --> 26:49.782
- Then you won't mind
if we take a look at inside?

26:49.825 --> 26:52.785
[quirky tense music]

26:52.828 --> 26:58.312
â™ª

26:58.355 --> 26:59.748
- Hi, hon.

26:59.792 --> 27:01.445
Two.

27:01.489 --> 27:03.970
- Everything okay, officers?
You care to pull up a chair?

27:04.013 --> 27:05.928
- We're following up on reports
of a stolen van

27:05.972 --> 27:08.627
being parked here.

27:08.670 --> 27:11.455
But there doesn't seem
to be one.

27:11.499 --> 27:13.066
- No, there doesn't.

27:13.109 --> 27:14.110
- Hmm.

27:14.154 --> 27:15.808
Well, sorry to disappoint you,

27:15.851 --> 27:17.679
but the only borderline
criminal activity

27:17.723 --> 27:19.812
going on around here is me

27:19.855 --> 27:21.814
taking this gentleman's
life savings away.

27:21.857 --> 27:23.990
- He's not wrong about that.

27:24.033 --> 27:25.861
Either of you two
have 20 bucks I can borrow?

27:25.905 --> 27:27.689
- Sorry about this.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.648
We were obviously
given some bad intel.

27:29.691 --> 27:32.259
- You're from Braddock, right?
Hey, do me a favor.

27:32.302 --> 27:33.564
You make sure
you tell Lieutenant Meegan

27:33.608 --> 27:35.741
that Sheriff Mike says
he still owes him $30

27:35.784 --> 27:36.872
from last month's poker game.

27:36.916 --> 27:39.919
- We'll tell him.
- Thank you.

27:47.753 --> 27:48.841
- What's happening?

27:48.884 --> 27:50.016
- After we talked yesterday,

27:50.059 --> 27:51.713
I took a look at the CCTV feed,

27:51.757 --> 27:54.934
and that van was driven
into Patience at 1:30 a.m.,

27:54.977 --> 27:56.718
three hours
after Peter Bach died.

27:56.762 --> 27:57.937
So, Deputy, you're right,

27:57.980 --> 27:59.678
there's some shady shit
going on here.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.157
- Where's the van?
- Don't worry.

28:01.201 --> 28:03.682
It's on the rez. It's safe.

28:03.725 --> 28:05.814
- Thank you.

28:05.858 --> 28:07.773
Thank you for believing me.

28:07.816 --> 28:10.689
And I'm sorry you had to break
the law to lie to the police.

28:10.732 --> 28:12.908
- Don't be sorry
because I didn't.

28:12.952 --> 28:15.737
Those two,
they weren't real cops.

28:15.781 --> 28:17.783
There's no Lieutenant Meegan
in Braddock.

28:17.826 --> 28:19.480
- Oh, my God.

28:19.523 --> 28:22.178
- So now I need you to tell me
who you think they really were.

28:22.222 --> 28:25.355
If you say something
about aliens...

28:25.399 --> 28:27.706
well, maybe this time
I'll listen.

28:27.749 --> 28:29.316
- [sighs]

28:32.711 --> 28:34.625
[somber music]

28:34.669 --> 28:37.672
- My people do not have
a word for failure.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.413
They lost the planet
to the Greys,

28:39.456 --> 28:41.937
but there is no failure.

28:41.981 --> 28:43.417
There is just moving forward

28:43.460 --> 28:46.899
and attempting
to save a different planet.

28:46.942 --> 28:49.945
My people may not know
the word "failure,"

28:49.989 --> 28:51.120
but I do.

28:51.164 --> 28:52.513
- [chittering]

28:52.556 --> 28:54.297
- I do not know
if the general can save

28:54.341 --> 28:55.864
this beautiful planet.

28:55.908 --> 28:58.388
It does not matter.
I can do nothing.

28:58.432 --> 29:01.043
I am Goliath,
and I know that if I stay,

29:01.087 --> 29:03.002
I will fail to save it.

29:03.045 --> 29:05.047
All I have left is my baby.

29:05.091 --> 29:07.963
I must protect him
and bring him home.

29:08.007 --> 29:11.358
I did not care about the baby
when I first saw it.

29:11.401 --> 29:14.317
I considered eating it
more than once.

29:14.361 --> 29:16.363
It would be tasty.

29:16.406 --> 29:20.497
But I have gotten to a place
all humans get to eventually.

29:20.541 --> 29:24.675
I no longer want
to eat my baby.

29:24.719 --> 29:29.768
[kisses loudly, sighs]
- [chittering]

29:29.811 --> 29:31.900
[pneumatic hiss]

29:31.944 --> 29:35.425
- Bridget needs me.

29:35.469 --> 29:37.427
And he is so cute
when he sleeps

29:37.471 --> 29:40.300
and sucks on one
of his four thumbs.

29:40.343 --> 29:44.913
â™ª

29:44.957 --> 29:47.089
I do not even mind
cleaning his poop.

29:47.133 --> 29:49.309
Oh.

29:49.352 --> 29:51.006
[chuckles softly]

29:51.050 --> 29:53.530
The angry girl
is not the only one

29:53.574 --> 29:56.185
who has been changed
by the baby.

29:56.229 --> 30:00.015
I have been changed too.

30:00.059 --> 30:02.539
[dramatic music]

30:02.583 --> 30:06.021
That is why Goliath
gave you to me.

30:06.065 --> 30:07.196
- [chittering]

30:07.240 --> 30:09.895
â™ª

30:09.938 --> 30:12.680
- I am different now.

30:14.160 --> 30:17.467
And I do not have to fail.

30:17.511 --> 30:21.994
I am not Goliath.

30:22.037 --> 30:23.952
Oh!

30:23.996 --> 30:26.476
You forgot your snacks!

30:26.520 --> 30:29.436
[soft quirky music]

30:29.479 --> 30:30.872
â™ª

30:30.916 --> 30:32.308
I'll eat them for you.

30:32.352 --> 30:35.746
â™ª

30:35.790 --> 30:40.316
- So from the mountains,
I see, like, this red light,

30:40.360 --> 30:45.365
like, starting to, like,
come up in an arc.

30:45.408 --> 30:47.889
And it met
where the white light was

30:47.933 --> 30:49.630
and then just,
like, disappeared.

30:49.673 --> 30:52.328
So it was, like, a rendezvous.

30:53.199 --> 30:54.853
- Can I ask you something?

30:54.896 --> 30:56.724
- Sure.

30:56.767 --> 30:58.944
- I've got this winter formal
thing coming up.

30:58.987 --> 31:02.382
- Mm.
- My mom bought me a dress.

31:03.470 --> 31:05.733
What do you think?

31:05.776 --> 31:07.778
- Um...

31:07.822 --> 31:09.563
It's--

31:09.606 --> 31:11.695
- It's awful.
- It's awful.

31:11.739 --> 31:13.306
I'm sorry.
[both chuckle]

31:13.349 --> 31:14.785
- My mom sucks at this.

31:14.829 --> 31:16.483
- No, it's not
your mom's fault.

31:16.526 --> 31:18.093
A dress like that would
look great on some people.

31:18.137 --> 31:20.617
It's just, our skin tone,
it's totally draining.

31:20.661 --> 31:23.925
- Yeah, I know.
I tried to tell her.

31:23.969 --> 31:28.103
Um...maybe you
can help me find one?

31:28.147 --> 31:29.844
- Really?

31:29.888 --> 31:31.890
- Can you come with me
to that new vintage store?

31:31.933 --> 31:33.413
Help look?

31:33.456 --> 31:36.155
- Uh, yeah.
I haven't been there yet.

31:36.198 --> 31:37.983
Is it--is it good?

31:38.026 --> 31:39.462
- It's so good.

31:39.506 --> 31:41.247
I also already
checked your schedule,

31:41.290 --> 31:42.465
so I know
you don't work tomorrow.

31:42.509 --> 31:44.119
- Oh.
- 3:00?

31:44.163 --> 31:46.469
- [chuckles]
Okay, sure.

31:46.513 --> 31:48.776
I'll be there.
- Great.

31:50.212 --> 31:52.649
- Jay?
- Yeah.

31:54.347 --> 31:56.131
- Really, I'll be there.

31:56.175 --> 31:58.133

some stuff in here.

32:13.366 --> 32:14.541
- Don't worry about it.

32:14.584 --> 32:16.673
I should have known
they weren't Asta's

32:16.717 --> 32:18.414
when they were left
in a neat pile.

32:18.458 --> 32:20.939
I threw them in here.

32:20.982 --> 32:22.505
- Thanks.

32:22.549 --> 32:24.029
- If you want
to clean Asta's room,

32:24.072 --> 32:26.161
I'm fine with that.

32:26.205 --> 32:27.336
- No, I'm okay.

32:27.380 --> 32:28.859
- Thought I'd give it a shot.

Ugh.

32:38.826 --> 32:40.959
Hmm.

32:41.002 --> 32:43.178
What's this?

32:43.222 --> 32:44.440
Could use this.

32:44.484 --> 32:46.486
Thanks, Asta.

32:46.529 --> 32:49.532

â™ª Aha

33:05.418 --> 33:08.290
â™ª I see a me in you

33:08.334 --> 33:10.379
- No.

33:10.423 --> 33:14.775
No, no.

33:20.346 --> 33:22.957
- Asta!

33:23.001 --> 33:25.177
- I thought I was never
gonna see you again.

33:25.220 --> 33:27.440
I thought the Greys left you
an escape pod

33:27.483 --> 33:28.789
and you were going home.

33:28.832 --> 33:31.270
- [chuckles]
Why would you think that?

33:31.313 --> 33:34.142
The Greys left me
an escape pod,

33:34.186 --> 33:36.623
so I'm finally going home.

33:36.666 --> 33:38.625
I did not leave.

33:38.668 --> 33:41.062
I sent the baby alone.

33:41.106 --> 33:42.933
- That's great.

33:42.977 --> 33:44.892
So you're gonna try
and help save the Earth?

33:44.935 --> 33:46.720
- I will try.

33:46.763 --> 33:52.769
But I had to protect Bridget,
so I sent him...home.

33:52.813 --> 33:54.119
- Bridget.

33:54.162 --> 33:56.295
That's what you settled on.
It's nice.

33:56.338 --> 33:58.166
- [sobbing]
I miss him so much!

33:58.210 --> 34:00.908
- Harry.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.956
- The human connection
to a child,

34:06.000 --> 34:08.394
it is powerful.

34:08.437 --> 34:10.004
- Yeah.

34:10.048 --> 34:12.354
- Someday...

34:12.398 --> 34:16.358
you and Jay will
be together again.

34:16.402 --> 34:19.405
And it will feel
very nice for you.

34:20.623 --> 34:23.104
- Thank you.

34:29.371 --> 34:31.156
- You want to tell me
why you have what I assume

34:31.199 --> 34:32.940
is the botulinum toxin
that killed Sam?

34:32.983 --> 34:33.984
- Where did you get that?

34:34.028 --> 34:35.377
- This is it, huh?

34:35.421 --> 34:38.206
This is your big secret.
Harry killed Sam.

34:38.250 --> 34:40.034
And you're covering for him.
Why?

34:40.078 --> 34:41.470
- It's not like that.

34:41.514 --> 34:44.082
You have to trust me.
- Trust you?

34:44.125 --> 34:45.996
You have been lying to me
for a year.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.520
You don't trust me.

34:47.563 --> 34:50.175
But you trust
some random-ass weirdo

34:50.218 --> 34:51.872
who just eats pizza
all goddamn day,

34:51.915 --> 34:53.439
and I guess is a murderer?

34:53.482 --> 34:55.005
Do you have--

34:55.049 --> 34:57.356
do you have any idea
what that does to me?

34:57.399 --> 34:59.836
No, you're the one person
that makes sense to me

34:59.880 --> 35:01.229
in this whole world,

35:01.273 --> 35:03.536
and without you, I am nothing.

35:03.579 --> 35:05.581
- You're a mess.

35:05.625 --> 35:07.192
- Just tell me.

35:07.235 --> 35:09.629
Tell me what's
going on right now.

35:09.672 --> 35:12.501
[soft music]

35:12.545 --> 35:14.547
- I can't.
I'm sorry, I can't.

35:14.590 --> 35:16.157
- Go get an apartment
with somebody else.

35:16.201 --> 35:17.289
- D'arce, come on.

35:17.332 --> 35:19.334
D'arce--
- No, let me go!

35:19.378 --> 35:21.031
I can't do this. I'm done.

35:21.075 --> 35:22.990
I can't be friends with you.

35:23.033 --> 35:24.513
Not if you lie to me.

35:24.557 --> 35:27.081
- D'arcy, no! No!

35:27.125 --> 35:29.475
Please, look, everything's
gonna be okay, okay?

35:29.518 --> 35:30.998
Um, I--I promise.

35:31.041 --> 35:33.566
You're my best friend.
- Am I?

35:33.609 --> 35:35.220
- Please.

35:35.263 --> 35:37.744
- 'Cause it was supposed to be
you and me against the world.

35:37.787 --> 35:39.659
You and me.

35:39.702 --> 35:42.705
And I would do anything
for you, and you know that.

35:42.749 --> 35:44.098
But you don't need me!

35:44.142 --> 35:45.926
- No, of course I need you.

- Oh!

36:09.689 --> 36:12.953
- This is your big secret?
- Yeah.

36:12.996 --> 36:15.434
- No, no, I'm not a dinosaur.

36:15.477 --> 36:16.609
I'm an alien.

36:16.652 --> 36:18.437
- Whatever. Same thing.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.613
Oh, my God,
of course you didn't tell me.

36:20.656 --> 36:23.268
This makes total sense now.
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

36:23.311 --> 36:24.834
- Dinosaur?
- I was so afraid.

36:24.878 --> 36:28.969
- Have you ever seen a dino--
I've seen dinosaurs.

36:29.012 --> 36:30.927
- I'm so relieved.
- You are?

36:30.971 --> 36:33.234
- Dinosaurs are not even
alive anymore.

36:33.278 --> 36:35.018
- Just don't cut me out.

36:35.062 --> 36:36.803
- Uh, hello?
- Ever.

36:36.846 --> 36:38.935
Again, you gotta tell me
everything, all right?

36:38.979 --> 36:40.110
- Of course, I will.

36:40.154 --> 36:41.373
- This alien
doesn't have pants,

36:41.416 --> 36:43.026
and you don't seem to notice.

36:43.070 --> 36:44.419
- Oh, yeah, I don't care
about that anymore.

36:44.463 --> 36:46.682
We're good.
- Okay.

36:46.726 --> 36:49.642
â™ª

36:49.685 --> 36:52.122

humans tie them together

36:52.166 --> 36:55.256

36:55.300 --> 36:57.258
Humans are stronger
when they have support

36:57.302 --> 37:00.218
from someone they care about.

37:00.261 --> 37:03.699

that have told me,

37:03.743 --> 37:06.485
you know,
after sharing my experience,

37:06.528 --> 37:11.054
things like, "I believe that
you believe what you saw."

37:11.098 --> 37:14.232
- Do you believe
that you saw a UFO?

37:14.275 --> 37:15.842
- I mean, I mentioned
that I saw something,

37:15.885 --> 37:20.760
but then my teacher,
uh, didn't believe me,

37:20.803 --> 37:23.980
and so I just pretended
that he was right

37:24.024 --> 37:26.113
and never mentioned it again.

37:26.156 --> 37:28.507
- You know,
this world that we live in

37:28.550 --> 37:32.554
is a lot more unconventional
than we think,

37:32.598 --> 37:37.167
and there's bizarre phenomenon
happening out there to people

37:37.211 --> 37:38.604
that's real.

to your teacher now?

[Mudcrutch's

They have to for survival.

â™ª I forgive it all

38:09.939 --> 38:14.553
