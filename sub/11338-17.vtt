00:09.170 --> 00:11.456
Once upon a time,

00:15.000 --> 00:18.413
there was a lonely king.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.699
He spent many days and many nights
wandering, searching,

00:23.710 --> 00:28.409
looking for that one special someone.

00:37.210 --> 00:42.659
-Good night, Jody.
-Good night, Mrs. Clemons.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.279
That one perfect woman
who would be his queen.

01:17.920 --> 01:18.989
Daddy!

01:25.620 --> 01:27.247
I was hoping you'd come tonight.

01:27.250 --> 01:28.786
Can you tell me another story?

01:28.790 --> 01:33.910
Well, why don't you lay back down
there and close your little eyes.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.160
Close your eyes.

01:42.210 --> 01:44.166
And the lonely king
searched far and wide,

01:44.170 --> 01:46.456
looking for this woman
who would be his queen.

01:46.960 --> 01:48.951
And he'd almost given up hope
of ever finding her,

01:48.960 --> 01:50.029
CLINES CORNER, NEW MEXICO

01:50.040 --> 01:56.536
when he came upon this small tavern
with a simple country barmaid.

01:57.040 --> 01:59.782
Now, when she looked at
the lonely king,

01:59.790 --> 02:02.918
he felt as if they had known each other
for a thousand years.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.114
Do you need a refill?

02:04.460 --> 02:07.532
Tanya,
I guess I'm going home alone.

02:07.540 --> 02:08.575
Excuse me a second.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.320
First of all, you're not alone.

02:10.790 --> 02:14.248
And secondly, you're not driving. Keys!

02:14.250 --> 02:16.320
Betty, Sam needs a cab.

02:16.330 --> 02:17.490
Sure.

02:21.380 --> 02:23.075
That's weird.

02:23.080 --> 02:24.206
Did you see where that guy went?

02:25.540 --> 02:26.666
Huh.

02:31.250 --> 02:34.742
So he waited
until she was alone,

02:34.750 --> 02:39.164
watching from afar
because he was afraid to speak to her.

02:47.580 --> 02:51.038
And then, one day,
her carriage wouldn't start.

02:54.580 --> 02:58.323
And the king thought, "This is fate."

03:03.330 --> 03:07.414
And so he rode down to rescue her,
and she said to him...

03:07.420 --> 03:08.535
Must be the rain.

03:09.420 --> 03:11.069
Pop the hood.

03:14.920 --> 03:15.955
Thank you.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.200
Did he rescue her, Daddy?

03:19.790 --> 03:22.748
-Was she the one?
-Well, the king thought so.

03:22.750 --> 03:24.115
Try it now.

03:29.170 --> 03:31.377
Hey. I appreciate your...

03:34.620 --> 03:36.417
Hello?

03:37.750 --> 03:41.413
Hello

03:46.120 --> 03:48.702
So they rode off into the night together.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.372
And they lived happily ever after?

03:51.960 --> 03:53.609
Well, no, sweet pea.

03:55.120 --> 03:57.418
She wasn't the one.

03:57.420 --> 04:02.164
But don't worry.
The king's never gonna stop looking.

04:02.460 --> 04:04.872
But what if he never finds a queen?

04:04.880 --> 04:08.532
Well, then he'll just go
to a better place.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.160
Good night, princess.

04:28.040 --> 04:30.531
Her name was Tanya Hill.
She was 29,

04:30.540 --> 04:33.452
a bartender, found two days ago
in Edgewood, New Mexico.

04:33.460 --> 04:35.610
She's the fifth woman
In over SIX months

04:35.620 --> 04:38.953
to be found dead in a ditch
off the I-40 and I-25.

04:38.960 --> 04:42.452
All were manually strangled.
None were sexually assaulted.

04:42.460 --> 04:45.031
Well, maybe the act of strangulation
is what gets him off.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.166
Where were they abducted from?

04:46.670 --> 04:47.785
All over.

04:47.790 --> 04:49.246
Well, they're not just
crossing state lines.

04:49.250 --> 04:50.990
These cities are hundreds
of miles apart.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.208
That's a lot of bodies.
Why has it taken so long to be invited?

04:54.210 --> 04:57.168
We haven't been invited.
We found this on the HSK database.

04:57.170 --> 04:59.377
Well, a lot of police departments
won't want this problem.

04:59.380 --> 05:02.326
The geographic profile shows
that only one of them has it.

05:02.330 --> 05:04.378
How do you know that?

05:04.380 --> 05:05.870
Because he has a comfort zone.

05:05.880 --> 05:08.610
Based on the direction he was heading
when he dumped the bodies,

05:08.620 --> 05:12.989
all five cases point to our UnSub
heading to Edgewood, New Mexico.

05:13.670 --> 05:15.615
And now, so are we.

05:43.790 --> 05:48.375
Hi. Excuse me. I think you forgot these.

05:48.380 --> 05:50.075
My gosh. You're so cute.

05:50.580 --> 05:53.037
Bye.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.490
Do you know anyone
that's heading west?

05:56.790 --> 05:58.951
Sorry.
-I am.

06:01.290 --> 06:02.370
Great.

06:46.170 --> 06:47.569
Tennessee Williams said,

06:47.580 --> 06:50.413
"We're _all of us sentenced
to solitary confinement

06:50.420 --> 06:52.285
"inside our own skins, for life."

06:52.710 --> 06:55.497
Clearly this UnSub doesn't
care about his victims being found.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.411
Or he knows he can't be linked to them.

06:57.420 --> 06:59.411
The M.E.'s report supports that.

06:59.420 --> 07:02.036
Matching DNA was found
on all five victims.

07:02.040 --> 07:03.917
Right.

07:03.920 --> 07:06.457
It's also in keeping with
the victimology and abduction sites.

07:06.460 --> 07:09.031
-Which are what?
-Target-rich and offender-friendly.

07:09.420 --> 07:11.035
The time of death
from the time of abduction

07:11.040 --> 07:12.871
varies dramatically in each case.

07:12.880 --> 07:16.611
Yeah, some lived 12 hours,
others 24 before they were killed.

07:16.620 --> 07:17.917
So what's he doing with them?

07:17.920 --> 07:19.535
Well, he's not having sex with them.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.531
There's no sign of torture
or even restraints.

07:21.540 --> 07:22.825
What was the matching DNA?

07:22.830 --> 07:23.956
Skin.

07:23.960 --> 07:27.498
That and metal shavings were found
under the fingernails of all five victims.

07:27.500 --> 07:31.072
Tanya only had one nail left.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.320
One nail?
PRENTISS: Yeah.

07:32.330 --> 07:35.458
It looks like whatever she was in,
she tried to claw her way out.

07:35.460 --> 07:37.951
JJ,
have Garcia match victimology

07:37.960 --> 07:41.111
and abduction sites
to HSK findings for the last year.

07:41.120 --> 07:42.917
If he sticks to this timeline,

07:42.920 --> 07:45.912
Edgewood is about to discover
another body.

07:55.540 --> 07:58.612
So she was abducted
32.9 miles west of here,

07:58.620 --> 07:59.996
which means, if they drove
the speed limit,

08:00.000 --> 08:03.322
they got here in 30 minutes or less.

08:03.330 --> 08:06.572
So, how long is it gonna take you
to get in that ditch?

08:07.330 --> 08:09.412
Get in that ditch

08:09.420 --> 08:11.820
My doctor says
I'm not allowed to do any climbing.

08:12.500 --> 08:14.661
It's a ditch.

08:16.750 --> 08:19.116
New boots, huh

08:19.880 --> 08:22.246
Yeah, what can I tell you?

08:22.250 --> 08:26.573
So, from here, I can be seen
by any passing vehicle.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.206
And I can't.

08:28.620 --> 08:30.702
-So she was dumped at night.
-Must have.

08:31.080 --> 08:35.574
He drives up, dumps the body.
Job done. He leaves.

08:35.580 --> 08:37.161
I don't think so.

08:37.790 --> 08:39.951
-What?
-All five victims were found

08:39.960 --> 08:42.781
posed in the fetal position
with their right arm palm up.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.530
Left arm palm down.

08:44.540 --> 08:46.610
-Remorse?
-Or staging.

08:47.120 --> 08:48.200
To look like what?

08:48.460 --> 08:49.745
Like they're asleep.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.610
Do you have any ideas why?

08:54.790 --> 08:56.371
No.

08:57.330 --> 09:00.572
Well, I guess there is a first time
for everything.

09:01.790 --> 09:05.203
Hey, Rossi, I'm gonna need a little
bit of help getting out of this ditch.

09:05.210 --> 09:07.326
Rossi

09:08.170 --> 09:11.207
Hey. I got it.

09:11.210 --> 09:13.531
Listen, I appreciate you guys
coming down here,

09:13.540 --> 09:15.167
but I've only got one body.

09:15.170 --> 09:17.115
Which we believe is the work
of a serial killer.

09:17.420 --> 09:20.036
Well, doesn't it have to be more
than one to be a series?

09:20.040 --> 09:22.747
If you include a slightly larger area
than just Edgewood,

09:22.750 --> 09:24.706
we've got five bodies.

09:24.710 --> 09:26.917
All strangled, all staged
and all dumped.

09:27.250 --> 09:29.821
-Why Edgewood?
-It's significant to him.

09:29.830 --> 09:32.287
We believe that he either grew up here
or he lives here now.

09:32.880 --> 09:36.077
Look, I'm sorry that somebody's driving
through my town and dumping bodies,

09:36.080 --> 09:38.116
but it doesn't mean he lives here.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.702
We're searching for more victims
through the HSK database.

09:40.710 --> 09:41.870
What's that?

09:41.880 --> 09:44.667
Highway Serial Killer database.
We started it a few years ago

09:44.670 --> 09:47.707
to track bodies found off
of major highways all over the country.

09:47.710 --> 09:49.450
Law enforcement,
no matter how small the town,

09:49.460 --> 09:52.702
reports the murders, and we use
the database to try to connect them.

09:52.710 --> 09:55.031
Whoever's killing these women
isn't slowing down.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.531
And he's about to dump another body
on your doorstep.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.281
-Oh, God. Qh, my God.

10:34.120 --> 10:37.328
Stop! Stop! What do you want?

10:37.330 --> 10:39.707
I'll do anything!
Just tell me what you want!

10:39.710 --> 10:41.166
I want you to be quiet.

10:43.250 --> 10:44.990
Okay. Okay. I'll stop.

10:45.420 --> 10:49.459
What else

10:49.460 --> 10:51.951
To talk.

10:54.620 --> 10:57.828
Okay. We can talk. We can talk.

10:57.830 --> 11:01.459
I want to talk. I want to do that.

11:14.620 --> 11:15.666
No.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.036
Here's an M.E. file
of another victim.

11:22.040 --> 11:24.782
We know that all these women
were strangled by the same UnSub.

11:24.790 --> 11:26.781
As evidence found by DNA

11:26.790 --> 11:28.746
and metal fragments
under their fingernails,

11:28.750 --> 11:33.699
but there's something else.
Tanya had diesel fuel on her clothing.

11:33.710 --> 11:36.167
Well, she was found off the freeway.
I'm sure they all had it.

11:36.620 --> 11:38.076
They all did, and sugar.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.742
Table sugar was found
on almost all the victims' clothing.

11:41.750 --> 11:42.956
Sugan

11:43.330 --> 11:44.740
It absorbs diesel fuel.

11:45.170 --> 11:46.205
It's a trucker trick.

11:46.670 --> 11:48.956
We know how he's transporting them.

12:12.170 --> 12:14.206
I'm thirsty.

12:15.710 --> 12:17.666
Please, I need a drink.

12:20.080 --> 12:21.570
I have some questions first.

12:21.880 --> 12:26.499
Anything. What

12:26.500 --> 12:27.706
Well, it's important.

12:29.420 --> 12:31.991
It's important that you listen.

12:32.750 --> 12:34.035
Are we clear?

12:35.040 --> 12:36.325
Okay.

12:37.580 --> 12:39.070
Are you religious?

12:41.250 --> 12:43.491
VVhat

12:44.210 --> 12:46.872
Do you believe in God?

12:52.750 --> 12:54.206
Yeah.

12:57.250 --> 12:59.536
Do you want children?

13:00.960 --> 13:05.784
Someday. Maybe.

13:11.790 --> 13:16.614
Yeah, I do. I do. I really want kids.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.913
I don't believe you do.

13:24.210 --> 13:26.417
No.

13:26.420 --> 13:28.911
Let me out of here!

13:36.000 --> 13:39.163
Courtney, it doesn't mean
he won't invite you to the prom.

13:39.170 --> 13:42.037
Seriously, Mom,
you just wouldn't understand.

13:42.040 --> 13:44.167
You know,
I did go to high school at one time.

13:44.170 --> 13:46.377
Yeah, like 50 years ago.

13:46.380 --> 13:49.417
I don't even know why I'm talking
to you about this.

13:49.420 --> 13:50.956
I'm just gonna let that one go.

13:53.620 --> 13:55.201
Thank goodness.

14:12.290 --> 14:13.871
Yeah. All right.

15:02.330 --> 15:03.376
Courtney?

15:08.210 --> 15:09.871
Courtney, is that you?

15:11.790 --> 15:13.781
Honey, will you stop fooling around?

15:32.120 --> 15:36.568
All right. All right. Thanks, baby girl.

15:36.580 --> 15:40.323
Garcia says there's 782 truckers
working and living in this county.

15:40.330 --> 15:42.571
We've got to narrow down
the specific routes.

15:42.580 --> 15:44.207
We'll need more than that.

15:44.210 --> 15:47.577
Daughter confirmed.
He's definitely driving a big rig.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.071
Now, she wasn't able to make out
any logos or see the plate.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.456
I'd like to talk to her.

15:55.670 --> 15:58.457
I've got checkpoints at every route
in and out of the county.

15:58.460 --> 16:01.111
If he's on the road, we'll find him.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.667
He doesn't hunt at rest stops.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.319
He just did.

16:04.330 --> 16:05.877
It's way too isolated here.

16:05.880 --> 16:07.108
It's a perfect place to take somebody.

16:07.620 --> 16:09.201
Not for this guy.

16:09.210 --> 16:10.746
He goes
to offender-friendly environments

16:10.750 --> 16:13.116
so he can blend in
and still interact with his victims.

16:13.120 --> 16:14.530
He hasn't had a chance to do that.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.781
Well, if he's from here,
why would he need a rest stop?

16:18.960 --> 16:22.498
Clean up, maybe.
Did you check the restrooms yet?

16:22.500 --> 16:24.821
Yeah, the sink is full of dirt
in the men's room.

16:32.420 --> 16:35.662
This is a dump site.
It's not an abduction site.

16:36.620 --> 16:39.111
He must have dumped a body
around here somewhere.

16:39.120 --> 16:41.497
Sheriff, I want you
to have your officers spread out.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.821
Tell them to start with the ditches.

16:49.620 --> 16:52.578
Any distinguishing marks

16:53.830 --> 16:56.822
I wasn't looking. I was texting.

16:59.080 --> 17:02.163
I heard a truck start,
and I went to the bathroom.

17:02.170 --> 17:04.286
She was gone.

17:04.290 --> 17:06.326
How are you gonna find her?

17:07.330 --> 17:09.161
There is a good chance he's going
to stay here.

17:09.580 --> 17:11.116
Why wouldn't he just run?

17:11.120 --> 17:13.111
Because he always
comes back to Edgewood.

17:13.120 --> 17:16.419
Your mother is the first woman
he's taken from here.

17:16.420 --> 17:17.956
We were just driving through.

17:18.290 --> 17:20.702
We live in Phoenix.

17:20.710 --> 17:24.532
Mom was just trying to get me home
so I could go to tryouts.

17:25.120 --> 17:27.611
You have to find her. She's all I have.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.571
-You should come down to the station.

17:31.580 --> 17:32.877
Excuse me.

17:35.580 --> 17:36.956
Hey. Where are you?

17:36.960 --> 17:40.032
I'm in the woods,
south of you. You need to see this.

17:43.790 --> 17:46.076
Strangled, metal shavings
under her nails.

17:48.210 --> 17:50.110
He dumps her body,
cleans up at the rest stop

17:50.120 --> 17:52.497
and then just happens to stumble
onto Nancy Campbell.

17:52.500 --> 17:55.537
So, he didn't wait a minute
between victims,

17:55.540 --> 17:58.282
and he left the daughter as a witness.

17:58.290 --> 18:00.827
Hey, what's going on with him?

18:00.830 --> 18:03.207
That's what
we need to find out.

18:10.710 --> 18:14.783
Okay. Latest victim is younger
than the others.

18:14.790 --> 18:16.872
-Was she posed as well?
-Yep.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.825
Nancy Campbell's abduction
hit the news.

18:19.330 --> 18:20.661
Let's hope he doesn't see it.

18:20.670 --> 18:24.071
He could panic, and then
he'll dump her faster than the last one.

18:24.080 --> 18:26.457
Why has he dumped one victim
and taken another within the hour?

18:28.460 --> 18:31.702
-What have you got, Garcia?
-A bloody and busy trucker.

18:32.710 --> 18:33.950
I have been on the HSK myself.

18:33.960 --> 18:36.702
I've connected four more victims
to this guy.

18:36.710 --> 18:39.417
-I'm sending their names to you now.
-That brings his count to 10.

18:39.920 --> 18:43.378
We need to get photos of the victims
Garcia identified up on the board.

18:43.380 --> 18:46.918
If we figure out why he's choosing
these women, we find him.

18:47.420 --> 18:50.992
Please. Please, let me out.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.286
I can't breathe.

18:59.080 --> 19:01.071
Why are you doing this?

19:02.750 --> 19:05.662
If you're quiet, the light stays on.

19:06.420 --> 19:11.164
What do you want

19:11.880 --> 19:13.495
You.

19:14.880 --> 19:19.249
No. Please. Please.

19:21.420 --> 19:23.877
What's all of this

19:23.880 --> 19:26.701
He started killing
months before we thought.

19:30.040 --> 19:31.610
She disappeared from a truck stop.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.029
What did she do for a living?

19:33.040 --> 19:35.326
According to her rap sheet,
everyone she could.

19:35.330 --> 19:36.706
Well, she's a lot lizard.

19:36.710 --> 19:39.167
That's a name they give prostitutes
who hang around truck stops.

19:39.170 --> 19:40.285
What about the others?

19:40.290 --> 19:42.576
Waitress, gas station attendant,
female trucker.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.575
Just Nancy Campbell,

19:44.580 --> 19:46.616
the latest abductee, but she's a widow.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.958
Yeah, well, her mom's gonna get
a lot more attention than...

19:50.460 --> 19:52.030
...well, all these other women.

19:53.250 --> 19:55.912
Taking Nancy Campbell
was a huge risk.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.160
It doesn't fit his MO.

19:57.170 --> 19:58.319
He must have had a reason.

20:00.540 --> 20:03.612
We just got some new information.
Come with me.

20:06.120 --> 20:08.577
Sorry, I'll be back in a minute.

20:08.580 --> 20:10.707
He had to have walked
right by that minivan.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.701
Why didn't he take Courtney?

20:12.710 --> 20:13.916
Maybe she's too young.

20:13.920 --> 20:16.320
She's closer to the victims' ages
than her mother.

20:16.330 --> 20:18.457
That parking lot was deserted.

20:18.460 --> 20:20.416
He could've taken Courtney.
Nobody would've seen a thing.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.786
But instead, he walks past her...

20:22.790 --> 20:24.371
Because that's not who he wants.

20:24.830 --> 20:26.161
He watched Nancy.

20:26.580 --> 20:28.286
He followed her
because he wanted her.

20:28.290 --> 20:30.611
So much so that he left Courtney
as a witness?

20:30.620 --> 20:32.281
What could be that important?

20:32.290 --> 20:34.667
Well, until a few hours ago,
he had a type.

20:34.670 --> 20:37.036
The other victims were younger,
less sophisticated.

20:37.040 --> 20:40.077
It wouldn't take more than a day
to figure out if they're worthy or not.

20:40.080 --> 20:41.707
Of what?

20:41.710 --> 20:42.870
Being his companion.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.536
Then he's completely delusional.

20:46.540 --> 20:48.531
I mean, there are easier ways
to figure that out.

20:48.540 --> 20:49.825
No, not for this guy.

20:50.420 --> 20:52.456
He's got a schedule that forces him
to stay on the road.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.075
He's alone for long stretches.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.241
He can't devote any real time
to courting them.

20:57.290 --> 21:00.703
You really think he's killing
because he's lonely?

21:02.120 --> 21:04.497
It wouldn't surprise me.

21:05.080 --> 21:06.911
How are the pancakes, princess?

21:06.920 --> 21:09.992
-Not as good as yours.

21:10.330 --> 21:12.321
Excuse me.

21:12.330 --> 21:14.378
-Look, Daddy. Do you like it?
-Well, now...

21:16.380 --> 21:18.325
Yeah, that's beautiful.

21:19.710 --> 21:22.577
You know,
your daddy really misses you.

21:24.420 --> 21:25.956
Can you tell me another story?

21:26.210 --> 21:28.280
Okay.

21:28.580 --> 21:31.913
So the lonely king
had all but given up hope

21:31.920 --> 21:34.070
of ever finding the beautiful queen.

21:45.210 --> 21:49.909
When all of a sudden...she appeared.

21:58.880 --> 22:02.168
Now this time, it was different.

22:02.170 --> 22:05.287
This time, he knew she was the one.

22:11.750 --> 22:16.039
This time she was perfect.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.495
Courtney?

22:21.710 --> 22:22.825
Courtney, is that you?

22:24.710 --> 22:27.611
Honey, will you stop fooling around?

22:29.670 --> 22:31.206
Sorry, sweetie, time to go.

22:31.210 --> 22:34.031
-Do we have to?
-It's time for school.

22:35.120 --> 22:38.749
Here. Why don't you go pick out
a candy bar to put in your lunch?

22:40.670 --> 22:41.989
Hey, princess, don't worry.

22:42.670 --> 22:44.035
We'll be a family again real soon.

22:49.290 --> 22:51.827
You've got to stop telling her that.

22:51.830 --> 22:53.320
Why? It's true.

22:54.120 --> 22:55.610
Nothing's changed.

22:55.620 --> 22:57.668
The judge isn't going
to let her live with you.

22:59.620 --> 23:00.746
I am trying.

23:00.750 --> 23:02.957
She's being placed with her
adoptive family.

23:03.960 --> 23:06.246
She is my daughter.

23:07.040 --> 23:10.168
You people can't just take her away.
You can't just do that.

23:10.170 --> 23:12.912
-I have more time.
-Mr. Hatchett, please.

23:16.620 --> 23:19.373
I wanted you to see her,
but clearly, that was a mistake.

23:21.710 --> 23:24.918
You've known for months now
that this was a pOSSIbIIIty.

23:26.460 --> 23:29.532
-I'm gonna make this work.
-By this afternoon?

23:31.620 --> 23:33.747
You can't take care of her.

23:34.040 --> 23:38.113
You can barely take care of yourself.
You're living in your truck.

23:38.120 --> 23:42.409
You're on the road,
and without a wife or a home,

23:43.000 --> 23:45.912
you just... You can't do it.

23:46.540 --> 23:47.996
You've got to let her go.

23:48.880 --> 23:52.998
Let her be happy.
I know you want that for Jody.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.820
Her mom would want
what's best for her...

23:54.830 --> 23:57.492
I'm what's best for her.

23:57.500 --> 24:01.869
Look, I made a promise that
I would not let anything happen to her.

24:01.880 --> 24:04.747
She is my little girl.

24:05.290 --> 24:08.202
No one's gonna love her
the way that I can.

24:08.210 --> 24:10.280
I mean, why can't you understand that?

24:13.750 --> 24:15.206
You all set?

24:17.330 --> 24:18.410
Love you, Daddy.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.577
Hey, come here. I love you, too.

24:26.960 --> 24:29.702
What about the queen

24:31.580 --> 24:32.877
I don't know.

24:34.210 --> 24:36.110
The story's not over yet, princess.

24:44.710 --> 24:46.826
Nancy Campbell's been missing
over 12 hours.

24:46.830 --> 24:49.492
If he jumped on the I-40
before we got the police blocks out...

24:49.500 --> 24:51.161
He could be three states over by now.

24:51.170 --> 24:52.785
We don't think he has time for that.

24:52.790 --> 24:55.452
He's courting these women.
He needs them in Edgewood.

24:55.460 --> 24:57.030
There are over 800 truckers on this list.

24:57.040 --> 24:59.281
We have to get Garcia
to run background on all of them.

24:59.290 --> 25:02.077
He's either parked at his own house
or he's hiding in plain sight.

25:02.080 --> 25:03.490
Listen, I've already given you a list

25:03.500 --> 25:06.116
of all the trucker stops
that we've checked in town.

25:06.120 --> 25:07.576
Gonna need to check them again.

25:19.580 --> 25:22.743
I've searched for you for a long time.
Did you know that?

25:23.750 --> 25:25.957
You know how important family is,
don't you?

25:27.000 --> 25:30.379
See, I knew you would.
You're not like the others.

25:31.330 --> 25:33.070
Would you like some water?

25:34.790 --> 25:36.701
No, thank you.

25:37.290 --> 25:39.952
That's not polite.

25:39.960 --> 25:42.997
I'm sharing with you.
You should accept.

25:45.790 --> 25:48.031
Yeah, please, that would be great.

25:48.750 --> 25:49.990
Much better.

25:51.540 --> 25:55.533
You know, family's everything.
With family, you're never alone.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.616
Please.

25:57.620 --> 25:59.576
If our daughter were crying,

26:00.830 --> 26:03.116
what would you do to get her to stop?

26:04.000 --> 26:05.820
Please let me go.

26:06.250 --> 26:11.028
If our daughter were crying,
what would you do to get her to stop?

26:12.880 --> 26:14.950
I don't know.

26:16.540 --> 26:21.318
I'd tell her a story. I'd hold her.
I don't know.

26:21.790 --> 26:22.916
You like stories?

26:23.290 --> 26:25.372
Our daughter likes stories.

26:27.880 --> 26:29.780
Look at you. You're a mess.

26:31.210 --> 26:36.330
I don't want the princess
to see you all dirty like that.

26:42.710 --> 26:47.579
I have a daughter. Please let me go.

26:51.920 --> 26:56.664
Please, let me go! Please! Please!

26:56.670 --> 27:00.538
Let me go! Please!

27:00.540 --> 27:05.876
Please, let me go! Let me go! Please!

27:37.620 --> 27:40.919
That's fine. Thanks.

27:41.880 --> 27:43.450
Is this about that missing woman?

27:43.460 --> 27:44.950
Do you know anything about it?

27:44.960 --> 27:46.871
Only what I saw on the news.

27:46.880 --> 27:48.370
We have reason to believe
that our suspect

27:48.380 --> 27:50.780
has been in your facility
in the past 24 hours.

27:50.790 --> 27:53.702
-Here -We could really use your help.

27:54.880 --> 27:56.780
Well, we could give you our manifest.

27:56.790 --> 27:58.951
It logs all the truckers and their loads.

27:58.960 --> 28:01.076
That's exactly what we need.

28:04.210 --> 28:05.700
All right, get up.
You're coming with me.

28:06.460 --> 28:08.826
-I said get up!
-No. Please!

28:11.880 --> 28:13.324
It's your dime, Mr. Amazing.

28:13.330 --> 28:15.457
Listen, I might have
something to narrow your search.

28:15.460 --> 28:16.825
We don't think he drives
for a company.

28:16.830 --> 28:18.616
The schedules are way too tight.

28:18.620 --> 28:20.997
In the past few months,
he's had the flexibility to hunt and kill,

28:21.000 --> 28:22.490
and he couldn't do all that
and run loads.

28:22.750 --> 28:26.493
So you need me to narrow down
to independent contractors.

28:26.500 --> 28:28.206
You're reading my mind, Red.

28:28.210 --> 28:30.075
I just e-mailed you the manifest
from the local depot

28:30.080 --> 28:31.661
where all the truckers check in.

28:31.670 --> 28:33.535
-Can you...-Of course I can.

28:34.120 --> 28:36.611
Seventy-six licenses registered
under "Own Authority."

28:36.620 --> 28:38.497
And I just sent them back to you.

28:38.500 --> 28:41.321
-Woman, you are good.-You have no idea.

28:41.330 --> 28:44.413
So, how many of these cases
have you worked on?

28:44.960 --> 28:46.416
Too many.

28:47.880 --> 28:50.667
How many of these women
have you gotten back alive?

28:51.380 --> 28:52.665
All right,
so let's go over this again.

28:52.670 --> 28:55.707
This offender is preferential.
Young women, mid to late 20$.

28:55.710 --> 28:59.373
He takes his time watching them.
He makes sure there are no witnesses.

28:59.380 --> 29:01.871
He kills them 12 to 24 hours
after abduction.

29:01.880 --> 29:03.916
And only now
that time frame's getting shorter.

29:03.920 --> 29:07.321
Then he comes home to Edgewood,
where he's home and he feels safe.

29:07.330 --> 29:11.414
Courtney, listen. This man,
he doesn't try to hide his victims.

29:11.420 --> 29:13.285
So you think she's still alive?

29:15.920 --> 29:17.740
I was so rude to her.

29:17.750 --> 29:20.071
I just don't want the last thing
I said to her to have been...

29:20.080 --> 29:23.959
If he had hurt her,
we would have found her already.

29:25.750 --> 29:27.411
So what's he doing to her?

29:27.420 --> 29:31.413
There's no rape involved,
so is it companionship he's after?

29:31.420 --> 29:34.207
There might be
an almost chivalrous aspect to this.

29:34.210 --> 29:35.416
How do you figure?

29:35.420 --> 29:37.456
Truckers have a romanticized image
of themselves,

29:37.460 --> 29:40.076
and, in fact, all lifestyles
revolving around the open road do.

29:40.080 --> 29:41.456
The Hells Angels, for instance.

29:41.460 --> 29:43.576
They refer to their women
as their "old ladies,"

29:43.580 --> 29:46.162
but, in fact, there's no one
they'd rather protect or die for.

29:46.170 --> 29:49.071
Their treatment of_women wouldn't be
out of place in King Arthur's court.

29:49.080 --> 29:51.992
And their sense of isolation
would amp up that fantasy.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.377
So he's looking for a wife.
He starts out with easy targets,

29:54.380 --> 29:57.076
and then he moves on to women
who could actually fill the role.

29:57.080 --> 29:58.786
Sweet, outgoing, warm.

29:59.290 --> 30:01.576
The bartender
who takes extra care of you,

30:01.580 --> 30:02.990
the chatty hitchhiker.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.571
But over the course of the day,
they fail the test.

30:05.580 --> 30:08.743
And this infuriates him, and then
he strangles them and dumps them.

30:08.750 --> 30:10.820
Okay, so why take Nancy Campbell?

30:10.830 --> 30:13.458
She's the opposite
of all the other victims he's taken.

30:13.460 --> 30:15.667
That's true. She's older.
She already has a kid.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.616
Maybe that's why she's still alive.

30:18.620 --> 30:19.951
What if he's not looking
for a companion?

30:19.960 --> 30:21.245
What if he's looking for a mother?

30:21.250 --> 30:22.456
If he's got a kid of his own,

30:22.460 --> 30:24.416
that would explain what keeps him
coming back to Edgewood.

30:24.670 --> 30:27.787
It would explain why
he walks past Courtney to get to Nancy.

30:27.790 --> 30:29.667
Just by watching,
he knows she's a mother.

30:29.670 --> 30:32.412
She's already qualified to pass any test.

30:32.420 --> 30:33.569
Garcia.

30:33.580 --> 30:34.706
Sir.

30:34.710 --> 30:37.167
I want you to narrow down the
Own Authority trucker list and tell me

30:37.170 --> 30:40.537
which ones have been through
a divorce recently or a custody battle.

30:40.540 --> 30:42.167
A custody fight
would be his stressor.

30:42.420 --> 30:45.162
Limit your searches to months prior
to the first murder.

30:45.420 --> 30:47.320
Got it. Thanks.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.877
-What's going on?
-Just hold on a second.

30:52.880 --> 30:54.279
Wait. What's going on?

30:54.290 --> 30:57.953
They found a body off the I-40.
No identification.

30:59.420 --> 31:00.489
Is she dead?

31:02.540 --> 31:03.575
We don't know.

31:04.040 --> 31:05.280
What do you mean you don't know?

31:07.540 --> 31:10.452
The police found a body,
and they aren't sure if it's your mother.

31:14.290 --> 31:15.700
I want to go.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.996
I think we should wait here.
-I need to see if it's her.

31:19.330 --> 31:21.161
Courtney, please.

31:21.170 --> 31:23.240
Dr. Reid and I are going to
stay here with you.

31:23.250 --> 31:25.616
And as soon as we know anything,
we will tell you.

31:26.040 --> 31:27.530
Okay?

31:50.330 --> 31:52.070
I'll call Emily.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.707
Are you sure?

31:53.710 --> 31:55.450
Okay. Thanks.

31:55.460 --> 31:56.700
It's not your mother.

31:58.330 --> 31:59.786
Hey, baby girl. Talk to me.

31:59.790 --> 32:02.167
Of your 76
independent truckers,

32:02.170 --> 32:05.958
I have 28 who are currently
involved in custody cases.

32:05.960 --> 32:07.496
How many of those cases
are still open?

32:07.960 --> 32:08.995
Eight pending.

32:09.290 --> 32:11.611
Not the most
relationship-friendly job, trucking.

32:11.620 --> 32:13.167
Look for instances
where the mother died.

32:13.170 --> 32:16.162
A guy like this wouldn't tear
a child away from his own mother.

32:16.620 --> 32:19.111
Caroline Hatchett died in a house fire,
leaving behind

32:19.120 --> 32:22.669
a 7-year-old daughter, Jody,
and a husband, Wade Hatchett.

32:22.670 --> 32:23.785
Wade lost his home,

32:23.790 --> 32:27.282
his wife and custody of his daughter
when the courts deemed him unfit.

32:27.290 --> 32:28.416
He's still contesting the case.

32:28.420 --> 32:29.956
Why was he deemed unfit?

32:29.960 --> 32:31.166
Uh...

32:31.620 --> 32:32.746
Double whammy.

32:32.750 --> 32:34.615
The job kept him away
for weeks at a time,

32:34.620 --> 32:37.612
and he didn't have any other family
to help him watch the girl.

32:37.620 --> 32:39.668
It looks like he bent over backwards
to try to make it work,

32:39.670 --> 32:40.955
but she missed a lot of school,

32:40.960 --> 32:42.530
and he was charged
with neglect of a minor.

32:42.540 --> 32:45.373
-Do you have an address?-Just a PO box for over a year.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.529
What about the daughter?

32:46.540 --> 32:49.828
Jody currently resides in foster care.
I'm sending you the file now.

32:50.080 --> 32:54.619
If this is the same UnSub,
he didn't bother to pose her this time.

32:54.620 --> 32:57.874
This is much more brutal.
It feels personal.

32:58.580 --> 32:59.820
Her name is Lynn Clemons.

33:00.460 --> 33:02.872
Deputies found a wallet
about a hundred yards up.

33:03.330 --> 33:04.615
It must have spilled out
when he dumped her.

33:04.960 --> 33:09.329
Garcia, we need everything
that you have on a Lynn Clemons.

33:09.330 --> 33:10.536
Lynn Clemons?

33:10.540 --> 33:13.782
She's the foster parent
of Jody Hatchett.

33:13.790 --> 33:16.748
I was just telling the others
her father is a trucker

33:16.750 --> 33:18.786
who lost custody when his wife died.

33:18.790 --> 33:20.530
Jody's in the process of being adopted.

33:20.880 --> 33:22.165
He ran out of time.

33:22.580 --> 33:26.289
No, he only has a PO box.

33:26.290 --> 33:28.110
He killed the foster parent.

33:29.290 --> 33:30.917
He's going after his daughter.

33:31.380 --> 33:33.746
Garcia, where is Jody Hatchett
right now?

33:36.170 --> 33:37.205
Wait!

34:01.380 --> 34:04.497
-Hey, Jody.
-Who are you?

34:04.500 --> 34:05.990
I'm Emily.

34:06.380 --> 34:10.168
-Where's Mrs. Clemons

34:12.790 --> 34:13.950
It's okay. Come on.

34:19.540 --> 34:21.201
Jody?

34:22.580 --> 34:24.116
What's going on?

34:24.120 --> 34:27.248
We're helping the police.
And we're trying to find your dad.

34:27.250 --> 34:28.490
Do you know where he is?

34:28.500 --> 34:29.535
No.

34:35.170 --> 34:38.412
Hotch!
Truck's coming up the road right now.

34:38.420 --> 34:40.456
Hey, Jody,
can we go play in your room?

34:41.460 --> 34:43.781
-It's right here.
-Okay.

35:11.540 --> 35:13.496
All right.

35:14.830 --> 35:16.491
Get up.

35:20.710 --> 35:21.950
Come on.

35:24.960 --> 35:26.416
Somebody's moving toward
the front of the cab.

35:26.830 --> 35:28.411
All right, it's Nancy Campbell.

35:28.420 --> 35:30.376
He's behind her,
and he's got his gun on her.

35:30.380 --> 35:31.495
Morgan, do you have a shot?

35:34.540 --> 35:35.609
Negative. Negative.

35:36.040 --> 35:37.917
He's using her as a shield.

35:37.920 --> 35:39.990
Hotch, he might kill Nancy
to get to Jody.

35:40.750 --> 35:44.322
-Did you paint all of these yourself?
-Mmm-hmm.

35:44.330 --> 35:47.288
It looks like they're sleeping.

35:47.290 --> 35:50.248
Yeah, the king tucks them in
just like my daddy does for me.

35:51.080 --> 35:52.786
Is this your mom here in this one?

35:53.170 --> 35:54.706
No. That's the queen.

35:54.710 --> 35:56.246
Who's that?

35:56.250 --> 35:59.287
She's the one that the king tried
to take home to the castle,

35:59.290 --> 36:00.666
but she didn't make it.

36:01.710 --> 36:03.450
What happened to her?

36:03.460 --> 36:04.825
Her carriage broke down,

36:04.830 --> 36:06.991
and he had to leave her behind
to save the princess.

36:08.540 --> 36:10.781
There's a lot of queens here.

36:10.790 --> 36:13.452
-They all look different.
-They are.

36:13.460 --> 36:16.452
-What happened to this one here?
-She was dirty.

36:16.460 --> 36:18.781
The king said, "How do you expect
to give my daughter a bath

36:18.790 --> 36:23.375
"if you can't even take one yourself?"
I liked that story.

36:24.380 --> 36:26.109
Do you make up all these stories?

36:26.120 --> 36:28.497
No, my daddy does.
I like painting them.

36:30.880 --> 36:33.280
Well, this story isn't over yet, is it?

36:33.290 --> 36:35.201
-That's what my dad said.
-He did?

36:35.210 --> 36:36.370
Mmm-hmm.

36:36.380 --> 36:39.918
Today we were eating pancakes,
and he said she was perfect.

36:42.330 --> 36:45.322
Hey, would you like to meet a queen?

36:46.250 --> 36:48.571
-Yeah!
-Yea h?

36:49.330 --> 36:50.570
Where's Jody?

36:51.420 --> 36:53.206
I don't see her.
What are they doing to her?

36:53.210 --> 36:57.829
Look, how old is Jody

36:57.830 --> 37:00.116
Daddy Are you there?

37:05.170 --> 37:06.660
Hi, baby.

37:06.670 --> 37:09.070
You need to tell me
the rest of the story.

37:13.960 --> 37:16.576
Well, the lonely king and the queen
are at the castle.

37:16.580 --> 37:18.377
To pick up the princess?

37:18.380 --> 37:21.452
Well, the guards are in the way.

37:24.290 --> 37:25.609
Will you let the queen talk to them?

37:27.710 --> 37:29.951
-They won't listen.-But I want to see her.

37:30.290 --> 37:32.872
Will you let her go
so she can hold me?

37:32.880 --> 37:34.495
You said that she's perfect.

37:34.500 --> 37:35.660
That she's the one.

37:35.670 --> 37:38.537
She wants to live in the big castle
with me.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.706
I need to see you.

37:47.790 --> 37:49.371
Okay.

37:52.790 --> 37:54.746
Okay.

38:09.330 --> 38:11.161
Hi, Daddy.

38:15.920 --> 38:17.820
Hi, princess.

38:29.210 --> 38:30.780
She's so pretty, Daddy.

38:30.790 --> 38:32.781
Go, go.

38:38.540 --> 38:39.575
Pickup secure.

38:40.420 --> 38:42.706
Now the king won't be lonely anymore.

38:44.040 --> 38:48.909
No, and they can live happily ever after.

38:49.250 --> 38:50.706
Why aren't you coming, too, Daddy?

38:51.080 --> 38:53.492
You did a great job, Jody.

38:53.500 --> 38:55.070
Are you going to the better place?

38:55.080 --> 38:56.240
What?

38:56.250 --> 38:59.378
Yeah. We're both going to
a better place, princess.

39:00.250 --> 39:01.660
Close your little eyes, sweet pea.

39:02.580 --> 39:03.615
Hatchett!

39:04.290 --> 39:05.746
Turn around.

39:58.460 --> 40:00.109
Christopher Lasch said,

40:00.120 --> 40:02.577
"Family is a haven
in a heartless world."

40:17.210 --> 40:18.245
What're you reading?

40:20.120 --> 40:22.327
The HSK database.

40:22.330 --> 40:24.707
Do you know there's probably
half a dozen serial killers

40:24.710 --> 40:27.372
driving around right now?

40:28.080 --> 40:29.240
What's really bothering you?

40:32.330 --> 40:36.243
Jody lost her mom and then her dad.

40:36.250 --> 40:38.161
And the couple who was going
to adopt her backed out.

40:38.920 --> 40:41.286
It's all over the news. It's just...

40:42.290 --> 40:43.871
It's just not fair.

40:45.460 --> 40:47.200
Her aunt saw the story.

40:47.880 --> 40:49.666
She came forward.

40:49.670 --> 40:51.820
She'd lost touch with Jody's mom
over the past few years,

40:51.830 --> 40:56.870
but she's their only living relative,
and she wants to raise Jody.

40:56.880 --> 40:59.531
-Rea|ly?
-Mmm-hmm.

41:03.420 --> 41:06.287
You know, Prentiss,

41:06.290 --> 41:11.318
when I think about the things
we see on a daily basis, all the bad,

41:11.330 --> 41:13.491
I'm still amazed at all the good.

41:15.290 --> 41:17.827
Yeah.

41:17.830 --> 41:19.821
Do you think it evens out?

41:23.080 --> 41:24.661
I'd like to think it does.
