<i>Years ago, I faced a similar sense</i>

<i>This is where I burned my wings.</i>

01:20.330 --> 01:22.916
<i>Now, you don't have wings,</i>

01:42.143 --> 01:43.436

<i>Well, then what do you need, Detective?</i>

01:47.774 --> 01:50.568
<i>Please, just tell me what I can do</i>

01:53.029 --> 01:55.740
<i>There is one thing you can do,</i>

<i>My apologies, Doctor. I don't mean</i>

02:24.978 --> 02:26.062
<i>but you weren't at work.</i>

02:26.563 --> 02:27.814
<i>It's 7:00 a.m.</i>

02:28.565 --> 02:29.440
<i>And?</i>

02:30.817 --> 02:32.277
<i>It's good that you're here, actually.</i>

02:32.360 --> 02:35.196

<i>about the detective quite urgently.</i>

02:35.530 --> 02:39.075

02:39.159 --> 02:40.243
<i>Lucifer, you should know--</i>

02:40.326 --> 02:43.538
<i>I should know better,</i>
<i>I need to be patient. Yes, I am aware.</i>

02:44.330 --> 02:46.291
<i>Not what I was going to say,</i>
<i>but it's a good point.</i>

02:46.374 --> 02:48.918
<i>The problem is,</i>
<i>if the detective focuses on work,</i>

02:49.002 --> 02:51.129
<i>then she's just going to avoid</i>
<i>dealing with her issues.</i>

02:51.212 --> 02:53.590
<i>I need to speed her along to </i>
<i>where everything's good again.</i>

02:53.673 --> 02:55.258
<i>Yeah. Thing is, Amenadiel--</i>

02:55.341 --> 02:57.886
<i>Is down in Hell waiting for me to return,</i>
<i>yes, I'm aware.</i>

02:57.969 --> 02:59.846
<i>Why do you think</i>
<i>I'm in such a bloody hurry?</i>

02:59.929 --> 03:00.972
<i>-Lucifer--</i>
<i>-Doctor,</i>

03:01.055 --> 03:04.934
<i>I need to clear things up</i>
<i>with the detective before I go home,</i>

03:05.560 --> 03:07.604
<i>because once I relieve my brother...</i>

03:08.730 --> 03:10.148
<i>who knows when I'll be back?</i>

03:10.773 --> 03:13.818
<i>It's... It's not like I can just</i>
<i>leave Hell unattended and...</i>

03:15.069 --> 03:15.904
<i>Amenadiel.</i>

03:34.214 --> 03:35.381
<i>[clears throat]</i>

03:37.008 --> 03:37.967
<i>There I was...</i>

03:39.302 --> 03:41.554
<i>wandering the corridors of Hell, when...</i>

03:41.971 --> 03:43.139
<i>I heard a voice.</i>

03:44.557 --> 03:46.809
<i>A voice that I never expected to hear</i>
<i>in Hell.</i>

03:47.268 --> 03:48.269
<i>Who was it?</i>

03:48.770 --> 03:50.772
<i>Mother Teresa, Mr. Rogers?</i>

03:51.022 --> 03:51.856
<i>Adele?</i>

03:51.940 --> 03:52.774
<i>Father.</i>

03:55.360 --> 03:56.611
<i>Dad spoke to you?</i>

03:56.694 --> 03:57.528
<i>Mm.</i>

03:58.696 --> 03:59.656
<i>Well, go on, then.</i>

04:00.240 --> 04:01.074
<i>What did he say?</i>

04:01.157 --> 04:03.493
<i>He told me that Hell no longer</i>
<i>requires a warden.</i>

04:04.452 --> 04:06.454
<i>-And?</i>
<i>-And that's it.</i>

04:07.747 --> 04:10.041
<i>So I came up here to see my son.</i>

04:11.251 --> 04:12.835
<i>I've only been back a few hours, Lucy.</i>

04:12.919 --> 04:14.629
<i>I was going to find you next.</i>

04:15.171 --> 04:16.464
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

04:17.215 --> 04:19.008
<i>I just spent millennia down there</i>

04:19.092 --> 04:21.803
<i>diligently doing everything He asked</i>
<i>without complaint,</i>

04:22.178 --> 04:25.431
<i>and you have one sleepover in Hell</i>
<i>and Dad tells you your watch is over?</i>

04:25.515 --> 04:26.641
<i>You know Father works in--</i>

04:26.724 --> 04:30.478
<i>If you finish that sentence, I will</i>
<i>punch you in your "mysterious ways."</i>

04:30.561 --> 04:31.813
<i>[gulps] Mm.</i>

04:32.146 --> 04:36.025
<i>Well, first the detective, now this?</i>
<i>Talk about salt in the wound.</i>

04:37.443 --> 04:38.653
<i>What happened with Chloe?</i>

04:38.736 --> 04:39.612
<i>Is she all right?</i>

04:39.696 --> 04:41.114
<i>Oh, I wouldn't know.</i>

04:41.322 --> 04:42.782
<i>She's been keeping me at arm's length</i>

04:42.865 --> 04:44.867
<i>ever since Michael told her</i>
<i>she's a gift from God.</i>

04:44.951 --> 04:46.160
<i>Oh... [sighs]</i>

04:46.244 --> 04:47.120
<i>Yeah.</i>

04:47.829 --> 04:49.289
<i>Wait a minute, does she know that--</i>

04:49.372 --> 04:50.915
<i>You're the one</i>
<i>who delivered the gift?</i>

04:51.958 --> 04:52.792
<i>No.</i>

04:52.917 --> 04:56.462
<i>Her brain was already plenty melted</i>
<i>without adding that to the mix.</i>

05:03.553 --> 05:04.804
<i>I found the bitch.</i>

05:05.346 --> 05:07.849
<i>Well, hi, Maze,</i>
<i>and good morning to you, too.</i>

05:07.932 --> 05:11.269
<i>You were right.</i>
<i>That abandonment stuff you talked about?</i>

05:12.186 --> 05:13.396
<i>Definitely her fault.</i>

05:18.943 --> 05:20.486
<i>You found your biological mother.</i>

05:20.570 --> 05:21.529
<i>Like I said,</i>

05:22.322 --> 05:23.448
<i>the bitch.</i>

05:23.948 --> 05:26.451
<i>Maze, I know your mother abandoned you,</i>

05:27.118 --> 05:29.495
<i>but it might help</i>
<i>to understand her perspective.</i>

05:31.289 --> 05:32.123
<i>Maybe...</i>

05:33.666 --> 05:36.294
<i>Maybe she was too young to handle it.</i>

05:37.128 --> 05:40.381
<i>My mother was 12,000 years old</i>
<i>when she had me.</i>

05:42.425 --> 05:43.259
<i>Well...</i>

05:44.177 --> 05:45.011
<i>[sighs]</i>

05:45.094 --> 05:48.014
<i>Parenting at any age can be terrifying.</i>

05:48.097 --> 05:49.432
<i>Nothing scared Lilith.</i>

05:50.391 --> 05:51.476
<i>Not then, at least.</i>

05:52.727 --> 05:56.939
<i>Well, no matter what, I'm sure</i>
<i>she feels terrible about the whole thing.</i>

05:57.023 --> 05:59.901
<i>She said she was happy she did it. Why...</i>

06:01.444 --> 06:03.488
<i>Why are you defending her?</i>

06:07.950 --> 06:09.035
<i>Because I get it.</i>

06:11.996 --> 06:14.749
<i>You're a great mother, Linda.</i>
<i>You would never do that to Charlie.</i>

06:14.832 --> 06:15.666
<i>No.</i>

06:18.920 --> 06:19.962
<i>Not Charlie.</i>

06:24.050 --> 06:25.051
<i>What are you saying?</i>

06:26.302 --> 06:27.637
<i>When I was very young...</i>

06:30.348 --> 06:31.599
<i>I had a baby.</i>

06:34.644 --> 06:35.686
<i>A girl.</i>

06:38.606 --> 06:39.565
<i>[sobs]</i>

06:40.316 --> 06:41.192
<i>And...</i>

06:42.235 --> 06:43.444
<i>And you abandoned her?</i>

06:43.528 --> 06:44.654
<i>Maze...</i>

06:48.074 --> 06:49.492
<i>You have to...</i>

07:05.466 --> 07:06.300
<i>Oh!</i>

07:06.384 --> 07:07.593
<i>Amenadiel, you're back.</i>

07:08.845 --> 07:10.388
<i>Wait, does that mean that Lucifer--</i>

07:10.471 --> 07:11.722
<i>No, no. He's still here.</i>

07:12.974 --> 07:15.184
<i>Everything in Hell has been taken care of.</i>

07:16.144 --> 07:19.856
<i>Well, I have no idea what that means,</i>
<i>but just add it to the list.</i>

07:20.481 --> 07:22.108
<i>Yeah, I heard. Um...</i>

07:23.025 --> 07:24.026
<i>Chloe, how are you doing?</i>

07:24.694 --> 07:25.653
<i>[scoffs]</i>

07:25.736 --> 07:28.865
<i>Did Lucifer send you to see how</i>
<i>my gift-from-God spiral's going?</i>

07:28.948 --> 07:30.491
<i>He doesn't even know I'm here.</i>

07:32.326 --> 07:33.161
<i>Oh.</i>

07:34.078 --> 07:36.205
<i>Well, luckily, I have this </i>
<i>to keep me busy.</i>

<i>Okay, Chloe.</i>

07:44.005 --> 07:45.923

<i>opening up to you now.</i>

10:31.839 --> 10:32.673
<i>Fair point.</i>

10:33.382 --> 10:35.384
<i>Hey, I know I said that I needed space,</i>

10:35.468 --> 10:37.845
<i>but I could really use your expertise</i>
<i>on this case.</i>

10:38.179 --> 10:40.681
<i>I'm at a convent in Silver Lake</i>
<i>off Cole and Galvin.</i>

10:41.265 --> 10:42.767
<i>How long do you think until you can...</i>

10:42.850 --> 10:44.268
<i>[mystical whooshing]</i>

10:44.393 --> 10:45.227
<i>...get here?</i>

10:45.936 --> 10:47.605
<i>Oh. Of course.</i>

10:47.688 --> 10:49.440
<i>Angel and all that.</i>

10:54.153 --> 10:55.488
<i>How can I help you, Chloe?</i>

11:09.085 --> 11:09.919
<i>Daniel.</i>

11:10.002 --> 11:11.587
<i>[clears throat] Yes?</i>

11:11.671 --> 11:14.173
<i>The detective doesn't want me helping</i>
<i>on her case right now.</i>

11:14.423 --> 11:15.466
<i>I really can't imagine why.</i>

11:15.549 --> 11:17.259
<i>You can't, actually,</i>

11:17.343 --> 11:20.680
<i>but, uh, I need to speed along her work,</i>
<i>which is when I realized</i>

11:20.763 --> 11:23.182
<i>that you, for once,</i>
<i>could be the answer to my problem.</i>

11:23.265 --> 11:24.266
<i>Bracelet bros for the win.</i>

11:26.018 --> 11:28.604
<i>No. Regardless,</i>

11:28.896 --> 11:31.982
<i>I thought that you and I could help</i>
<i>her case along from behind the scenes.</i>

11:32.066 --> 11:32.983
<i>-Hmm.</i>
<i>-Mm.</i>

11:33.067 --> 11:34.902
<i>Well, what do you think you're sitting on?</i>

11:34.985 --> 11:36.904
<i>This is Chloe's case. I mean, I'm digging</i>

11:36.987 --> 11:39.156
<i>through background checks,</i>
<i>witness statements.</i>

11:40.116 --> 11:42.368
<i>This is what you do every day?</i>

11:44.161 --> 11:45.329
<i>What did you think I did?</i>

11:45.413 --> 11:47.873
<i>Well, I don't know,</i>
<i>solve your own bloody murders?</i>

11:47.957 --> 11:49.041
<i>[laughs]</i>

11:49.125 --> 11:51.419
<i>Daniel, you're just a glorified librarian.</i>

11:51.502 --> 11:53.254
<i>I do solve my own cases, Lucifer.</i>

11:53.671 --> 11:55.423
<i>But we also support each other, and this,</i>

11:55.506 --> 11:58.050
<i>all of this,</i>
<i>this is what real police work looks like.</i>

11:58.175 --> 12:00.845
<i>Right, well, real police work</i>
<i>looks very boring.</i>

12:01.470 --> 12:04.223
<i>Look, you want to help</i>
<i>speed along the case or not?</i>

12:05.850 --> 12:06.809
<i>[sighs deeply]</i>

12:14.650 --> 12:16.569
<i>Standing in these walls, it...</i>

12:17.778 --> 12:19.947
<i>reminds me of being in the Silver City.</i>

12:20.823 --> 12:22.867
<i>Wait, this is what Heaven looks like?</i>

12:22.950 --> 12:26.662
<i>No, but there's so much love</i>
<i>for my father here, it feels similar.</i>

12:28.914 --> 12:30.875
<i>And yet also so very different.</i>

12:31.625 --> 12:32.918
<i>How can I help you, Chloe?</i>

12:34.128 --> 12:36.464
<i>I do have to remind you that, uh...</i>

12:36.881 --> 12:38.591
<i>I can't slow down time like I used to.</i>

12:39.216 --> 12:40.092
<i>What?</i>

12:40.426 --> 12:42.553
<i>I didn't even know that </i>
<i>that was an option.</i>

12:43.220 --> 12:45.514
<i>Wow. Well, what can you do?</i>

12:45.598 --> 12:47.725
<i>Well, I am God's greatest warrior.</i>

12:47.808 --> 12:48.642
<i>[scoffs]</i>

12:48.726 --> 12:52.521
<i>Well, as much as I love the mental image</i>
<i>of you punching a bunch of nuns,</i>

12:53.147 --> 12:55.149
<i>the issue is they're freezing me out,</i>

12:55.232 --> 12:57.109
<i>and I thought with you</i>
<i>being an angel and all,</i>

12:57.193 --> 12:59.069
<i>maybe you could use that.</i>

12:59.153 --> 13:01.447
<i>Chloe, I can't expose myself to them.</i>

13:01.530 --> 13:02.406
<i>[gasps]</i>

13:04.283 --> 13:05.701
<i>-No, not...</i>
<i>-[groans]</i>

13:07.286 --> 13:08.871
<i>My angelic side, I mean.</i>

13:09.079 --> 13:11.749
<i>That's not what I meant. I was thinking</i>
<i>more along the lines of, like,</i>

13:11.832 --> 13:12.917
<i>Lucifer's mojo.</i>

13:13.292 --> 13:14.794
<i>Do you have the same effect on people?</i>

13:14.877 --> 13:16.045
<i>I'm sorry, I don't.</i>

13:18.547 --> 13:19.548
<i>Are you sure?</i>

13:20.132 --> 13:23.135
<i>[angelic choral music playing]</i>

13:40.611 --> 13:42.404
<i>Thank you for coming back,</i>

13:42.988 --> 13:44.573
<i>for being willing to listen.</i>

13:50.996 --> 13:52.498
<i>Uh... [clears throat]</i>

13:55.417 --> 13:56.418
<i>[sighs]</i>

13:59.964 --> 14:01.340
<i>I haven't told anyone this.</i>

14:08.931 --> 14:10.975
<i>I got pregnant when I was 17...</i>

14:13.435 --> 14:17.940
<i>and I spent the entire pregnancy</i>
<i>in denial.</i>

14:19.400 --> 14:20.609
<i>[sighs]</i>

14:21.819 --> 14:24.738
<i>Even when I started to deliver,</i>
<i>I thought...</i>

14:28.325 --> 14:30.160
<i>there had to be a mistake.</i>

14:37.626 --> 14:38.460
<i>But then...</i>

14:41.714 --> 14:42.965
<i>after the birth...</i>

14:44.633 --> 14:46.010
<i>when I held her...</i>

14:48.929 --> 14:50.890
<i>Well, there was no denying that...</i>

14:54.101 --> 14:55.769
<i>[sighs] ...she was mine...</i>

14:57.396 --> 14:59.023
<i>and I was her mom.</i>

15:04.820 --> 15:06.989
<i>But then they took her to the NICU and...</i>

15:10.242 --> 15:11.577
<i>the whole thing...</i>

15:12.578 --> 15:14.580
<i>seemed like a dream.</i>

15:15.372 --> 15:16.206
<i>One...</i>

15:16.916 --> 15:20.377
<i>One that I was completely</i>
<i>unprepared to handle.</i>

15:22.755 --> 15:25.799
<i>Your baby was a nightmare. Got it.</i>

15:25.925 --> 15:26.759
<i>No.</i>

15:27.301 --> 15:28.302
<i>God, no.</i>

15:29.887 --> 15:32.014
<i>No, she was perfect...</i>

15:33.807 --> 15:35.517
<i>and beautiful, and...</i>

15:40.230 --> 15:43.150
<i>And I didn't have the strength</i>
<i>to raise her.</i>

15:46.737 --> 15:47.696
<i>[sobs]</i>

15:49.823 --> 15:51.909
<i>And I didn't have the strength to face</i>

15:52.826 --> 15:54.203
<i>giving her up.</i>

15:56.997 --> 15:57.915
<i>So...</i>

16:02.586 --> 16:05.130
<i>So when the nurses were away...</i>

16:12.346 --> 16:13.389
<i>I left.</i>

16:16.058 --> 16:17.142
<i>So you just...</i>

16:19.937 --> 16:21.230
<i>You just walked away?</i>

16:23.524 --> 16:25.234
<i>Is that why you think</i>
<i>you're going to Hell?</i>

16:30.656 --> 16:34.243
<i>I thought I could pretend</i>
<i>it never happened, but the truth is...</i>

16:35.869 --> 16:37.538
<i>The truth is, Maze...</i>

16:39.039 --> 16:41.166
<i>I think about her every...</i>

16:42.209 --> 16:44.086
<i>single day.</i>

16:45.963 --> 16:48.757
<i>I've even tried to find her</i>
<i>a couple of times.</i>

16:50.300 --> 16:51.885
<i>I wonder where she is now.</i>

16:52.928 --> 16:54.096
<i>How she's doing.</i>

16:55.723 --> 16:57.016
<i>She seems good.</i>

17:00.436 --> 17:01.270
<i>What?</i>

17:03.355 --> 17:05.357
<i>[Amenadiel] </i>
<i>We really appreciate you talking to us.</i>

17:05.441 --> 17:06.942
<i>Oh, absolutely. I...</i>

17:08.444 --> 17:10.237
<i>I feel like I can tell you anything.</i>

17:10.320 --> 17:15.117
<i>Uh, do you know of anyone who would</i>
<i>want to hurt Sister Victoria?</i>

17:19.038 --> 17:22.082
<i>Do you know of anyone who would</i>
<i>want to hurt Sister Victoria?</i>

17:24.460 --> 17:26.628
<i>Well, I...</i>

17:30.132 --> 17:32.092
<i>I'm not... I'm not sure.</i>

17:37.389 --> 17:39.933
<i>Do you know of anyone who would</i>
<i>want to hurt Sister Victoria?</i>

17:40.017 --> 17:41.894
<i>Yes. I do.</i>

17:42.186 --> 17:44.313
<i>-Who?</i>
<i>-The Devil, of course.</i>

17:45.272 --> 17:46.106
<i>Anyone else?</i>

17:46.190 --> 17:48.275
<i>You are the most beautiful person</i>
<i>I've ever seen.</i>

17:48.358 --> 17:49.485
<i>Thank you.</i>

17:49.985 --> 17:54.615
<i>The question was, do you know of anyone</i>
<i>who would want to hurt Sister Victoria?</i>

17:55.157 --> 17:56.075
<i>Oh.</i>

17:57.117 --> 17:58.869
<i>Right. No, I don't. Sorry.</i>

17:59.453 --> 18:03.165
<i>I don't know who would want to kill</i>
<i>that wonderful soul.</i>

18:03.248 --> 18:06.168
<i>But you're hiding something, aren't you?</i>

18:06.251 --> 18:07.127
<i>Yes.</i>

18:08.253 --> 18:09.671
<i>It's a secret.</i>

18:10.714 --> 18:15.427
<i>But who can lie to those gorgeous eyes?</i>

18:17.054 --> 18:19.640
<i>So the mother superior of the nunnery</i>
<i>is a murderer?</i>

18:19.723 --> 18:22.518
<i>Mm-hmm. Apparently, Mother Angelica</i>
<i>committed the crime years ago,</i>

18:22.601 --> 18:24.394
<i>and then ran away and joined this convent.</i>

18:24.478 --> 18:25.896
<i>She's been here ever since.</i>

18:26.605 --> 18:29.483
<i>Most of the nuns knew about it,</i>
<i>but they were just protecting her.</i>

18:29.942 --> 18:32.277
<i>Well, until you gave them</i>
<i>some of your mojo.</i>

18:32.361 --> 18:34.822
<i>Yeah, I can't explain that.</i>
<i>That's never happened before.</i>

18:34.905 --> 18:38.200
<i>Well, they're nuns, you're an angel.</i>
<i>Maybe they sense that.</i>

18:39.827 --> 18:40.661
<i>Maybe.</i>

18:42.329 --> 18:43.789
<i>Maybe. I'm just glad it helped.</i>

18:43.872 --> 18:47.960
<i>Well, maybe our victim found out the truth</i>
<i>and wanted to go to the police,</i>

18:48.043 --> 18:49.920
<i>Mother Angelica tried to silence her?</i>

18:50.629 --> 18:52.464
<i>I'll have Dan dig into it,</i>
<i>see if that helps.</i>

18:52.548 --> 18:54.258
<i>[woman] That won't be necessary.</i>

18:56.552 --> 19:01.098
<i>I'm sorry that my sisters tried</i>
<i>to hide my past sins.</i>

19:01.723 --> 19:05.394
<i>It's only out of concern for me.</i>
<i>Please do not judge them too harshly.</i>

19:07.354 --> 19:08.313
<i>Shall we?</i>

19:13.110 --> 19:16.822
<i>I can't believe there's so much paperwork</i>
<i>for one single convent.</i>

19:16.905 --> 19:18.532
<i>I mean, they're nuns, after all.</i>

19:18.824 --> 19:21.326
<i>How many interesting things</i>
<i>can happen to them, really?</i>

19:24.037 --> 19:25.998
<i>A single convent? Mm-mm.</i>

19:26.123 --> 19:28.667
<i>These are all just the files</i>
<i>on Mother Angelica.</i>

19:29.251 --> 19:30.127
<i>What?</i>

19:30.210 --> 19:31.211
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

19:31.295 --> 19:33.463
<i>-This is going to take forever.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

19:33.755 --> 19:35.257
<i>It'd be much faster in person, Daniel.</i>

19:35.340 --> 19:36.967
<i>I could seduce the truth out of them.</i>

19:37.050 --> 19:39.469
<i>Bro, there are 30 nuns there.</i>

19:39.553 --> 19:40.721
<i>I doubt that's faster.</i>

19:40.804 --> 19:43.682
<i>-Well, it's certainly more fun.</i>
<i>-Come on, this is fun.</i>

19:43.765 --> 19:44.641
<i>Is it?</i>

19:46.268 --> 19:47.686
<i>A murder, man, it's like a...</i>

19:47.769 --> 19:49.646
<i>It's like a gigantic puzzle,</i>

19:49.730 --> 19:51.523
<i>only you don't know</i>
<i>what the corner pieces are,</i>

19:51.607 --> 19:53.442
<i>or what it's going to look like</i>
<i>when it's done.</i>

19:53.525 --> 19:55.777
<i>You just described torture.</i>
<i>Trust me, I know.</i>

19:55.861 --> 19:58.488
<i>It could take hours, days,</i>
<i>years even, man.</i>

19:58.572 --> 19:59.615
<i>Definitely torture.</i>

20:00.073 --> 20:02.784
<i>I see all your self-help nonsense</i>
<i>has gone for naught.</i>

20:03.327 --> 20:06.705
<i>But nothing in the world feels better</i>
<i>than when you find that one piece,</i>

20:06.788 --> 20:09.082
<i>and then boom!</i>
<i>Suddenly it all clicks together.</i>

20:11.126 --> 20:12.002
<i>Oh, hello.</i>

20:14.046 --> 20:15.672
<i>Oh, I think I found the piece, Daniel.</i>

20:18.550 --> 20:19.718
<i>Let me talk to them.</i>

20:20.385 --> 20:22.054
<i>Shortcuts are not the answer, Lucifer.</i>

20:23.013 --> 20:23.972
<i>Hard work...</i>

20:24.640 --> 20:25.807
<i>[clicks tongue] ...pays off.</i>

20:26.433 --> 20:27.643
<i>[Lucifer sighs]</i>

20:27.726 --> 20:28.769
<i>[elevator dings]</i>

20:31.104 --> 20:32.147
<i>Ah-ha!</i>

20:32.231 --> 20:35.275
<i>The detective already has a suspect.</i>
<i>Excellent.</i>

20:38.946 --> 20:39.780
<i>Brother.</i>

20:39.863 --> 20:40.822
<i>Oh, Lucy.</i>

20:40.906 --> 20:42.241
<i>What on Earth are you doing here?</i>

20:42.324 --> 20:43.909
<i>Chloe asked me to help on her case.</i>

20:43.992 --> 20:46.203
<i>[laughs] Right.</i>

20:47.955 --> 20:49.122
<i>You're not joking.</i>

20:49.873 --> 20:52.167
<i>But I need this case solved quickly.</i>

20:52.251 --> 20:54.836
<i>Much as I appreciate you</i>
<i>playing Detective Amenadiel,</i>

20:54.920 --> 20:56.797
<i>perhaps you should leave it</i>
<i>to the professionals.</i>

20:57.130 --> 20:58.048
<i>Like the Devil?</i>

20:58.131 --> 20:59.925
<i>I'm a consultant.</i>

21:00.342 --> 21:02.552
<i>I understand human desire. You're just--</i>

21:02.636 --> 21:04.554
<i>Just the one who found our latest suspect.</i>

21:04.638 --> 21:05.722
<i>Oh, really?</i>

21:06.974 --> 21:07.808
<i>Really?</i>

21:08.850 --> 21:09.726
<i>You know...</i>

21:10.644 --> 21:12.688
<i>Chloe and I actually make</i>
<i>a really great team.</i>

21:12.771 --> 21:14.982
<i>I can see why you enjoy working with her.</i>

21:16.316 --> 21:18.277
<i>If you'll excuse me, I'm just gonna...</i>

21:26.118 --> 21:28.287
<i>I grew up in Puerto Rico,</i>

21:28.954 --> 21:31.081
<i>in the worst neighborhood</i>
<i>you could imagine.</i>

21:31.748 --> 21:33.041
<i>When I was 16,</i>

21:33.750 --> 21:36.378
<i>I killed a man in self-defense.</i>

21:37.462 --> 21:40.549
<i>I fled here to escape retribution,</i>

21:41.258 --> 21:46.096
<i>and eventually found reconciliation</i>
<i>in the arms of God.</i>

21:47.889 --> 21:49.725
<i>But Sister Victoria found out the truth.</i>

21:50.350 --> 21:51.268
<i>She did.</i>

21:51.351 --> 21:52.978
<i>I informed her last week.</i>

21:53.061 --> 21:54.646
<i>But she didn't accept it, did she?</i>

21:54.730 --> 21:56.273
<i>She was going to report you,</i>

21:56.356 --> 21:59.443
<i>and you felt like you had</i>
<i>to defend yourself once again, didn't you?</i>

21:59.526 --> 22:01.945
<i>She was so understanding,</i>

22:02.029 --> 22:03.739
<i>as all my sisters have been.</i>

22:04.239 --> 22:05.615
<i>Detective,</i>

22:05.699 --> 22:07.159
<i>I didn't kill her.</i>

22:07.576 --> 22:11.872
<i>In fact, I was leading prayers</i>
<i>when Sister Victoria was murdered.</i>

22:11.955 --> 22:15.375
<i>Well, unfortunately,</i>
<i>your alibi is a bunch of nuns</i>

22:15.459 --> 22:17.127
<i>who have proven</i>
<i>that they'll cover for you.</i>

22:18.337 --> 22:19.254
<i>[sighs]</i>

22:25.344 --> 22:27.888
<i>Are you sure there isn't anything else</i>
<i>you want to tell us?</i>

22:29.723 --> 22:33.185
<i>I can see why my sisters were so eager</i>
<i>to talk with you.</i>

22:33.268 --> 22:36.063
<i>-[Amenadiel chuckles] </i>
<i>-If there was more to tell, I would,</i>

22:36.146 --> 22:37.314
<i>but that's all I have.</i>

22:37.397 --> 22:40.150
<i>Everything else is in God's hands.</i>

22:40.484 --> 22:42.444
<i>If this is the path He wants me on...</i>

22:43.612 --> 22:45.155
<i>He must have his reasons.</i>

22:45.238 --> 22:48.158
<i>You're really willing to give up</i>
<i>your free will, just like that?</i>

22:49.493 --> 22:51.787
<i>I am willing to have faith.</i>

22:51.870 --> 22:52.954
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

22:53.747 --> 22:55.624
<i>I know that look in your eyes.</i>

22:55.707 --> 22:58.877
<i>Over the years our convent has taken in</i>
<i>many women like you,</i>

22:58.960 --> 23:02.339
<i>women who feel powerless, adrift.</i>

23:03.131 --> 23:07.344
<i>You have more control than you think,</i>
<i>my child.</i>

23:08.720 --> 23:10.389
<i>[scoffs, clears throat]</i>

23:10.931 --> 23:11.765
<i>Which is it?</i>

23:12.516 --> 23:13.517
<i>Control or faith?</i>

23:13.600 --> 23:15.268
<i>You can't have it both ways.</i>

23:16.853 --> 23:19.147
<i>I have faith in you, Detective.</i>

23:19.731 --> 23:21.441
<i>You help the helpless.</i>

23:22.275 --> 23:24.444
<i>It takes great strength to do that,</i>

23:24.945 --> 23:28.949
<i>and I think you have the strength</i>
<i>to find who really did this.</i>

23:34.287 --> 23:35.455
<i>[Lucifer sighs]</i>

23:36.456 --> 23:38.750
<i>What is taking so long?</i>

23:40.001 --> 23:41.128
<i>[Dan sniffs]</i>

23:42.921 --> 23:44.172
<i>Did you spike my coffee?</i>

23:44.256 --> 23:47.801
<i>It's the only way to get through</i>
<i>yet another tedious and useless task.</i>

23:47.884 --> 23:48.718
<i>You're welcome.</i>

23:49.803 --> 23:50.637
<i>Phone records.</i>

23:50.720 --> 23:51.638
<i>Come here.</i>

23:52.305 --> 23:54.683
<i>They give us a sense of who she was,</i>

23:54.766 --> 23:56.393
<i>or who might have had</i>
<i>a reason to kill her.</i>

23:56.476 --> 23:58.687
<i>It's all about paying attention</i>
<i>to the details.</i>

23:58.770 --> 24:02.190
<i>Well, how about this detail?</i>
<i>The detective already caught the killer.</i>

24:02.274 --> 24:04.484
<i>You sure I'm the one</i>
<i>who's not paying attention?</i>

24:06.111 --> 24:08.405
<i>Look, this number right here. Come here.</i>

24:08.488 --> 24:10.407
<i>This one, it keeps showing up.</i>

24:10.490 --> 24:12.784
<i>First at regular intervals,</i>
<i>then with increasing frequency</i>

24:12.868 --> 24:14.536
<i>leading up to the time of her death.</i>

24:14.953 --> 24:17.706
<i>Then on the day before her death,</i>
<i>it's all missed calls.</i>

24:18.623 --> 24:19.958
<i>Victim wasn't answering her phone.</i>

24:20.417 --> 24:22.294
<i>Maybe somebody got tired</i>
<i>of being ignored.</i>

24:22.377 --> 24:24.004
<i>Well, that can't be right.</i>

24:24.337 --> 24:25.172
<i>Why?</i>

24:25.255 --> 24:26.840
<i>That's Destiny Page's number.</i>

24:26.923 --> 24:28.675
<i>No one in their right mind</i>
<i>would ignore her.</i>

24:28.758 --> 24:30.260
<i>Wait, Destiny Page, the pop star?</i>

24:30.343 --> 24:31.803
<i>-Mm.</i>
<i>-How would you know her number?</i>

24:31.887 --> 24:33.930
<i>-Funny story--</i>
<i>-Never mind, don't wanna know.</i>

24:34.764 --> 24:35.724
<i>I gotta tell Chloe.</i>

24:36.224 --> 24:37.893
<i>Well, as long as it speeds things along.</i>

24:37.976 --> 24:39.478
<i>It actually might be a new lead.</i>

24:40.103 --> 24:40.937
<i>Great work, Lucifer.</i>

24:41.730 --> 24:43.023
<i>Take that back!</i>

24:47.277 --> 24:48.570
<i>So...</i>

24:50.530 --> 24:51.698
<i>Destiny Page.</i>

24:52.949 --> 24:53.825
<i>So you know the name.</i>

24:54.451 --> 24:56.870
<i>Why am I guessing it's not 'cause</i>
<i>you're a fan of her music?</i>

24:56.995 --> 24:59.164
<i>'Cause she wanted to buy our convent.</i>

24:59.456 --> 25:02.125
<i>But I didn't think anyone knew about it</i>
<i>other than me.</i>

25:02.209 --> 25:03.502
<i>You turned her down?</i>

25:03.585 --> 25:05.545
<i>Yeah, she was very upset.</i>

25:07.506 --> 25:11.593
<i>Wait, do you think she had anything</i>
<i>to do with Sister Victoria's death?</i>

25:11.676 --> 25:12.552
<i>We don't know.</i>

25:16.097 --> 25:20.185
<i>Why would Destiny Page be calling a nun</i>
<i>at a convent that she wants to buy?</i>

25:20.810 --> 25:23.480
<i>Well, her latest album was a testament</i>
<i>to a new-found faith,</i>

25:23.563 --> 25:26.316
<i>and the one that she's working on </i>
<i>is supposed to continue in that vein.</i>

25:28.735 --> 25:29.778
<i>Please don't tell Lucifer.</i>

25:29.861 --> 25:31.780
<i>Your secret's safe with me.</i>

25:32.280 --> 25:34.908
<i>So if Destiny is a new convert,</i>

25:34.991 --> 25:36.201
<i>we should go talk to her.</i>

25:45.293 --> 25:46.127
<i>Ready?</i>

25:46.711 --> 25:48.463
<i>[sighs] Her name is Adriana.</i>

25:50.173 --> 25:52.133
<i>I always wondered what they named her.</i>

25:53.593 --> 25:54.427
<i>[Maze] Hmm.</i>

25:55.637 --> 25:56.471
<i>Here she comes.</i>

25:57.973 --> 25:59.808
<i>Hello, great to see you.</i>

26:02.978 --> 26:03.937
<i>I...</i>

26:05.063 --> 26:05.939
<i>You...</i>

26:08.525 --> 26:10.151
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

26:11.152 --> 26:12.320
<i>Excuse me?</i>

26:12.946 --> 26:16.074
<i>That you look exactly like you do</i>
<i>on the bus posters.</i>

26:16.157 --> 26:18.159
<i>[laughs] That's sweet, thank you.</i>

26:18.827 --> 26:19.661
<i>This is Linda.</i>

26:20.245 --> 26:21.621
<i>-She's your--</i>
<i>-Potential buyer.</i>

26:23.748 --> 26:26.251
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>I know we don't have an appointment.</i>

26:26.334 --> 26:27.669
<i>It's fine, come on in.</i>

26:27.752 --> 26:29.004
<i>Okay, great.</i>

26:29.087 --> 26:29.921
<i>Welcome.</i>

26:30.589 --> 26:32.716
<i>-Welcome.</i>
<i>-So pretty.</i>

26:32.924 --> 26:34.342
<i>Oh! Thanks.</i>

26:35.885 --> 26:38.680
<i>If you ladies wouldn't mind signing in,</i>
<i>thank you.</i>

26:41.558 --> 26:43.101
<i>[mouthing indistinctly]</i>

26:43.184 --> 26:48.398
<i>Seeing a house for the first time</i>
<i>can be very overwhelming.</i>

26:48.481 --> 26:51.651
<i>I just need time to warm up to the space.</i>

26:51.735 --> 26:52.861
<i>Take all the time you need,</i>

26:52.944 --> 26:54.446
<i>and if you have any questions as we go,</i>

26:54.529 --> 26:56.114
<i>-feel free to ask.</i>
<i>-I do.</i>

26:57.198 --> 26:58.116
<i>Adoption.</i>

26:58.742 --> 26:59.618
<i>Yea or nay?</i>

26:59.701 --> 27:02.245
<i>What my partner is trying to say is,</i>

27:02.329 --> 27:06.124
<i>uh, how's the school district?</i>
<i>Because we're considering adoption.</i>

27:07.334 --> 27:10.128
<i>Schools are great.</i>
<i>All the way through grade 12.</i>

27:10.837 --> 27:14.174
<i>And personally, I think it's wonderful</i>
<i>that you're thinking of adopting.</i>

27:14.257 --> 27:17.218
<i>I was adopted, actually.</i>
<i>Best thing that's ever happened to me.</i>

27:17.302 --> 27:18.178
<i>Really?</i>

27:18.637 --> 27:21.806
<i>Yeah, but do you have a problem</i>
<i>connecting with people?</i>

27:22.766 --> 27:24.267
<i>Over Wi-Fi?</i>

27:25.435 --> 27:26.686
<i>How's the signal?</i>

27:26.770 --> 27:28.438
<i>I don't think there's been any problems.</i>

27:28.521 --> 27:30.190
<i>How about maintaining relationships?</i>

27:30.774 --> 27:32.817
<i>I'm not sure what this has to do</i>
<i>with the house.</i>

27:32.901 --> 27:34.903
<i>This is... [grunts]</i>

27:35.820 --> 27:36.821
<i>Sorry, you're right.</i>

27:37.238 --> 27:39.616
<i>This looks like a beautiful home.</i>

27:39.699 --> 27:40.617
<i>It really is.</i>

27:41.242 --> 27:43.328
<i>I wonder why someone would abandon it.</i>

27:43.411 --> 27:45.622
<i>-Okay, can you give us a minute?</i>
<i>-Of course.</i>

27:48.166 --> 27:49.250
<i>What are you doing?</i>

27:49.334 --> 27:50.960
<i>Trying to get you</i>
<i>to connect with your kid.</i>

27:51.044 --> 27:53.546
<i>Oh, really? 'Cause it seems like</i>
<i>you're making it about yourself,</i>

27:53.630 --> 27:55.507
<i>while trying to torture me in the process.</i>

27:55.882 --> 27:59.094
<i>Or I am trying to get you</i>
<i>to tell your daughter the truth.</i>

28:03.014 --> 28:03.890
<i>I can't.</i>

28:05.725 --> 28:06.601
<i>[sighs]</i>

28:07.018 --> 28:10.271
<i>You tracked down your mother</i>
<i>because you were ready to see her.</i>

28:10.939 --> 28:12.565
<i>But who knows when...</i>

28:14.442 --> 28:17.946
<i>or </i>if <i>Adriana will ever be ready</i>
<i>to see me?</i>

28:18.029 --> 28:18.947
<i>[sighs]</i>

28:20.990 --> 28:23.535
<i>I'm realizing it needs to be up to her.</i>

28:25.412 --> 28:26.246
<i>Coward.</i>

28:29.624 --> 28:30.667
<i>I'm not Lilith.</i>

28:32.043 --> 28:34.629
<i>If you have something</i>
<i>you need to say to your mother...</i>

28:35.755 --> 28:37.424
<i>you should say it to her.</i>

28:52.147 --> 28:54.357
<i>Ah, wrong suspect. Rookie move.</i>

28:54.441 --> 28:55.608
<i>You sure your powers are gone?</i>

28:55.692 --> 28:57.444
<i>'Cause it feels like</i>
<i>you're slowing down time.</i>

28:57.527 --> 28:59.529
<i>Because you always get the first suspect</i>
<i>right away?</i>

28:59.612 --> 29:01.865
<i>Well, I've certainly never arrested a nun,</i>
<i>that's for sure.</i>

29:03.575 --> 29:07.203
<i>Lucifer, I want Chloe to resolve</i>
<i>her issues just as much as you do.</i>

29:07.287 --> 29:08.496
<i>Because you're feeling guilty?</i>

29:08.872 --> 29:09.831
<i>Why would I feel guilty?</i>

29:09.914 --> 29:12.625
<i>Because you're the one who performed</i>
<i>the miracle on the detective's mom</i>

29:12.709 --> 29:13.543
<i>in the first place.</i>

29:13.626 --> 29:14.919
<i>-That wasn't my--</i>
<i>-You what?</i>

29:24.053 --> 29:25.096
<i>Go ahead, talk.</i>

29:29.017 --> 29:30.977
<i>Years ago, at Father's behest,</i>

29:31.728 --> 29:35.398
<i>I came down to Earth to lay a blessing</i>
<i>on one...</i>

29:36.524 --> 29:37.609
<i>Penelope Decker.</i>

29:37.692 --> 29:38.526
<i>Huh?</i>

29:39.527 --> 29:40.570
<i>When my mom and dad were...</i>

29:41.446 --> 29:44.282
<i>trying to have kids,</i>
<i>they said they'd just about given up.</i>

29:44.365 --> 29:45.909
<i>And soon after my visit,</i>

29:46.618 --> 29:47.452
<i>you were born.</i>

29:53.249 --> 29:54.083
<i>Amenadiel.</i>

29:56.961 --> 29:57.962
<i>You're my dad?</i>

29:59.088 --> 30:00.381
<i>[laughs]</i>

30:02.342 --> 30:03.968
<i>[clears throat] Of course not.</i>

30:04.052 --> 30:07.388
<i>So "laid a blessing" isn't a euphemism?</i>

30:07.806 --> 30:09.474
<i>Well, not in this case, at least.</i>

30:09.557 --> 30:11.851
<i>No, Chloe, no. Lucy, stop.</i>

30:11.935 --> 30:15.063
<i>Listen, Chloe,</i>
<i>your parents are still your parents,</i>

30:15.647 --> 30:18.358
<i>and I'm so sorry that</i>
<i>I didn't tell you any of this earlier.</i>

30:18.441 --> 30:19.651
<i>-I just--</i>
<i>-It's okay.</i>

30:20.735 --> 30:21.569
<i>It's okay.</i>

30:22.570 --> 30:23.404
<i>So...</i>

30:24.322 --> 30:26.699
<i>I'm the only one immune to Lucifer's mojo.</i>

30:27.450 --> 30:28.284
<i>So...</i>

30:30.578 --> 30:32.121
<i>Do I have any powers, or...</i>

30:32.872 --> 30:33.706
<i>anything cool?</i>

30:36.251 --> 30:38.586
<i>I don't know, laser beam hands, something?</i>

30:43.550 --> 30:44.384
<i>No.</i>

30:45.218 --> 30:46.845
<i>No. Of course not.</i>

30:47.428 --> 30:51.975
<i>They were just concerned with creating</i>
<i>the perfect Mrs. Morningstar.</i>

30:55.228 --> 30:56.145
<i>Why me?</i>

30:57.438 --> 30:58.773
<i>I don't know, Chloe.</i>

30:59.232 --> 31:03.236
<i>Detective, when I found out</i>
<i>about this... manipulation,</i>

31:03.319 --> 31:04.904
<i>I felt the same way as you.</i>

31:05.655 --> 31:08.825
<i>But then I realized</i>
<i>that it's far from a curse.</i>

31:09.158 --> 31:09.993
<i>It's a gift.</i>

31:10.952 --> 31:11.995
<i>I only hope that...</i>

31:13.162 --> 31:15.456
<i>in time, you come to see it that way, too.</i>

31:15.540 --> 31:18.835
<i>There is a huge difference, Lucifer.</i>

31:19.586 --> 31:21.796
<i>You were given a gift.</i>

31:21.880 --> 31:23.882
<i>I </i>am<i> that gift.</i>

31:26.509 --> 31:28.136
<i>I mean, I'm not even a person.</i>

31:28.928 --> 31:30.054
<i>I'm just a thing,</i>

31:30.513 --> 31:32.015
<i>created for someone else.</i>

31:35.310 --> 31:36.144
<i>I...</i>

31:38.271 --> 31:39.188
<i>Uh...</i>

31:39.522 --> 31:41.149
<i>I got to get back to work.</i>

31:45.278 --> 31:46.821
<i>-[Lucifer sighs]</i>
<i>-[door closes]</i>

31:47.530 --> 31:48.615
<i>Well, that went well.</i>

31:53.036 --> 31:56.456
<i>[woman] On five, six, seven, up, and go!</i>

31:56.539 --> 31:57.665
<i>Give me some life.</i>

31:57.749 --> 32:00.460
<i>Walk, one, two, three, four.</i>

32:00.543 --> 32:02.211
<i>Try and stay on the beat, two,</i>

32:02.295 --> 32:04.589
<i>three, four, and up, six,</i>

32:04.672 --> 32:05.548
<i>seven, eight.</i>

32:05.632 --> 32:07.800
<i>Come on, you guys. Two, three, four,</i>

32:07.884 --> 32:09.886
<i>and five... Oh, my God! Cut!</i>

32:10.428 --> 32:11.471
<i>Kill the music.</i>

32:11.554 --> 32:15.224
<i>Destiny, you're great, but, guys,</i>
<i>we've done this 45 times already.</i>

32:16.267 --> 32:17.393
<i>It is so bouncy.</i>

32:24.734 --> 32:27.236
<i>Um, Detective Decker, LAPD.</i>

32:27.320 --> 32:28.905
<i>I need to speak with Destiny Page.</i>

32:28.988 --> 32:32.075
<i>I'm afraid Miss Page needs total privacy</i>
<i>while she prays.</i>

32:32.158 --> 32:33.159
<i>Ah.</i>

32:33.534 --> 32:35.870
<i>Well, Hank, uh,</i>

32:35.954 --> 32:37.997
<i>as much as I respect that,</i>
<i>I need to talk to her.</i>

32:38.081 --> 32:41.292
<i>Well, her schedule is pretty packed.</i>
<i>Uh, maybe next Saturday?</i>

32:41.876 --> 32:42.835
<i>Mm.</i>

32:42.919 --> 32:44.379
<i>Unless you have a warrant.</i>

32:46.214 --> 32:47.173
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:55.598 --> 32:57.183
<i>[mystical whooshing]</i>

33:01.646 --> 33:02.772
<i>-[gasps]</i>
<i>-Whoa.</i>

33:02.855 --> 33:04.607
<i>It's all right,</i>
<i>I've listened to your music.</i>

33:04.691 --> 33:06.859
<i>I know you're a person of faith, so...</i>

33:08.528 --> 33:10.738
<i>I'm pretty sure that I should have </i>
<i>a, um...</i>

33:11.447 --> 33:12.949
<i>calming effect on you.</i>

33:14.701 --> 33:16.411
<i>-That's right.</i>
<i>-Hank!</i>

33:17.662 --> 33:18.496
<i>Hey!</i>

33:19.706 --> 33:21.249
<i>Hey, what are you doing in here, pal?</i>

33:21.332 --> 33:22.500
<i>-What's going on?</i>
<i>-[Chloe] Wait!</i>

33:22.583 --> 33:23.876
<i>-Wait, he's with me.</i>
<i>-Is he?</i>

33:24.335 --> 33:25.378
<i>What's he doing in here?</i>

33:28.715 --> 33:30.049
<i>What are you doing in here?</i>

33:32.051 --> 33:33.761
<i>I thought she might tell me</i>
<i>about the murder,</i>

33:33.845 --> 33:35.346
<i>given how pious she's supposed to be.</i>

33:35.847 --> 33:39.934
<i>But her recent music is clearly</i>
<i>just a collection of beautiful lies.</i>

33:40.018 --> 33:40.893
<i>[Destiny] Murder?</i>

33:40.977 --> 33:42.145
<i>Was someone killed?</i>

33:42.228 --> 33:43.813
<i>Yeah. Victoria Reynard.</i>

33:45.023 --> 33:47.191
<i>-Destiny, you do not--</i>
<i>-It's okay.</i>

33:48.568 --> 33:50.528
<i>That's why she stopped taking my calls.</i>

33:50.611 --> 33:51.988
<i>-So you admit to knowing her?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

33:52.071 --> 33:53.031
<i>She's my assistant.</i>

33:53.489 --> 33:55.408
<i>So Mother Angelica refused to sell,</i>

33:55.491 --> 33:58.411
<i>and what, you sent your assistant</i>
<i>to gather intel?</i>

33:58.828 --> 34:00.872
<i>It seemed like a good idea at the time,</i>

34:01.289 --> 34:04.042
<i>until Victoria fell in love with the life.</i>

34:04.125 --> 34:06.794
<i>And then what?</i>
<i>You killed her 'cause she betrayed you?</i>

34:06.878 --> 34:08.838
<i>What? You think I killed her?</i>

34:08.921 --> 34:10.423
<i>I loved Victoria,</i>

34:10.506 --> 34:11.966
<i>and I was happy for her.</i>

34:13.718 --> 34:14.594
<i>Eventually.</i>

34:14.677 --> 34:17.346
<i>But if it was all an act,</i>
<i>why were you praying when I came in?</i>

34:18.139 --> 34:19.098
<i>I wasn't.</i>

34:21.434 --> 34:23.936
<i>I've been sober for a month.</i>

34:24.020 --> 34:25.480
<i>I was so tempted.</i>

34:25.563 --> 34:27.857
<i>I guess I should thank you</i>
<i>for stopping me.</i>

34:28.441 --> 34:30.026
<i>Where were you yesterday at 10:00 a.m.?</i>

34:31.235 --> 34:32.528
<i>AA meeting.</i>

34:32.612 --> 34:33.529
<i>Got my...</i>

34:34.238 --> 34:36.074
<i>one month chip and everything.</i>

34:36.741 --> 34:38.117
<i>Can anyone vouch for you?</i>

34:38.201 --> 34:39.243
<i>I go in disguise.</i>

34:39.327 --> 34:41.287
<i>Black bob wig, pink hoodie.</i>

34:41.370 --> 34:44.040
<i>What about that one-month chip?</i>
<i>That would prove you were there.</i>

34:44.832 --> 34:47.210
<i>I went to goat yoga after.</i>

34:47.710 --> 34:49.837
<i>It fell out of my pocket, and you know...</i>

34:50.671 --> 34:51.672
<i>they eat everything.</i>

34:51.756 --> 34:53.925
<i>Are you saying a goat ate your alibi?</i>

34:57.261 --> 34:58.096
<i>Hey.</i>

34:58.805 --> 34:59.931
<i>I need a favor.</i>

35:00.014 --> 35:01.057
<i>[goats bleating]</i>

35:04.769 --> 35:06.354
<i>[Lucifer] I suppose I deserve this.</i>

35:08.022 --> 35:09.398
<i>Deserve what, exactly?</i>

35:09.732 --> 35:13.027
<i>The humiliating tasks,</i>
<i>the tedium, the stink.</i>

35:13.319 --> 35:15.571
<i>I shouldn't have tried</i>
<i>to rush the detective.</i>

35:15.655 --> 35:17.990
<i>But you, on the other hand,</i>
<i>could move faster, Daniel.</i>

35:18.074 --> 35:21.536
<i>Lucifer, if you want this to go faster,</i>
<i>you could actually help, for a change.</i>

35:21.953 --> 35:22.870
<i>Oh!</i>

35:24.247 --> 35:25.081
<i>Very well.</i>

35:36.717 --> 35:38.177
<i>[woman] Put it in the box.</i>

35:38.261 --> 35:40.429
<i>What is this?</i>
<i>You don't need to wrap everything.</i>

35:43.141 --> 35:44.767
<i>Can you put that in faster?</i>

35:47.603 --> 35:48.604
<i>Excuse me.</i>

35:48.688 --> 35:51.399
<i>Uh, where's the woman that lived here?</i>

35:51.482 --> 35:53.651
<i>Lily Rose? She died a couple days ago.</i>

35:54.152 --> 35:55.611
<i>Left a ton of junk.</i>

35:59.657 --> 36:00.867
<i>Was she someone to you?</i>

36:00.950 --> 36:02.160
<i>You want any of this stuff?</i>

36:02.243 --> 36:03.077
<i>No.</i>

36:05.538 --> 36:06.539
<i>Maybe, uh...</i>

36:07.456 --> 36:08.332
<i>Can I just...</i>

36:09.417 --> 36:10.543
<i>have a minute, please?</i>

36:10.626 --> 36:12.086
<i>Sure. Hey, guys, come on.</i>

36:12.587 --> 36:14.672
<i>We're-- We're clearing the room.</i>
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

36:21.512 --> 36:27.185
<i>["Paradise" by Anderson Rocio plays]</i>

36:58.466 --> 36:59.425
<i>[screams]</i>

37:11.854 --> 37:12.939
<i>Nice bracelet.</i>

37:13.022 --> 37:14.190
<i>I wouldn't normally wear it,</i>

37:14.273 --> 37:16.984
<i>but my friend Daniel said</i>
<i>he needs his chakras realigned,</i>

37:17.068 --> 37:19.153
<i>so I'm doing it for him, really.</i>

37:19.362 --> 37:20.238
<i>This is how you help?</i>

37:20.321 --> 37:21.155
<i>Really?</i>

37:21.364 --> 37:22.949
<i>Daniel! I'm...</i>

37:23.032 --> 37:24.742
<i>What do you call it? Canvassing.</i>

37:25.952 --> 37:27.662
<i>And it pains me to say you were right.</i>

37:27.745 --> 37:29.038
<i>I put in the work, and it paid off.</i>

37:29.997 --> 37:30.873
<i>What do you mean?</i>

37:31.040 --> 37:32.458
<i>Well, I interviewed everyone,</i>

37:32.541 --> 37:34.377
<i>and when I spoke to lovely Amberley here,</i>

37:34.460 --> 37:36.963
<i>she confirmed that someone attended class</i>

37:37.046 --> 37:39.840
<i>with black hair cut into a bob</i>
<i>and wearing a pink hoodie.</i>

37:41.175 --> 37:42.009
<i>Great.</i>

37:42.093 --> 37:44.762
<i>Well, according to the transcript</i>
<i>the detective sent over,</i>

37:44.845 --> 37:46.472
<i>that's what Destiny Page was wearing.</i>

37:47.473 --> 37:49.475
<i>Wait, you actually read the transcript?</i>

37:50.893 --> 37:52.520
<i>No shortcuts, Daniel.</i>

37:53.813 --> 37:54.772
<i>[chuckles]</i>

37:54.855 --> 37:55.815
<i>[chuckles]</i>

37:55.898 --> 37:57.358
<i>Well, perfect timing,</i>

37:57.441 --> 38:00.569
<i>because we just confirmed</i>
<i>that Destiny Page isn't our killer.</i>

38:02.530 --> 38:04.198
<i>So we're back to square one.</i>

38:06.117 --> 38:06.993
<i>Yeah.</i>

38:07.076 --> 38:08.160
<i>[Lucifer sighs, groans]</i>

<i>Daniel, would you stop staring?</i>
<i>Can't you see the woman's engaged?</i>

38:13.499 --> 38:14.333
<i>Yep.</i>

38:15.126 --> 38:16.585
<i>That's exactly what I see.</i>

38:22.258 --> 38:23.092
<i>Ha!</i>

38:23.759 --> 38:24.593
<i>Thank you.</i>

38:35.646 --> 38:36.480
<i>What?</i>

38:37.440 --> 38:38.482
<i>I admire you.</i>

38:39.191 --> 38:40.026
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

38:40.609 --> 38:41.527
<i>Yeah.</i>

38:41.610 --> 38:45.448
<i>You hit dead end after dead end,</i>
<i>but you still keep on searching.</i>

38:46.365 --> 38:47.366
<i>Doesn't deter you.</i>

38:47.450 --> 38:50.411
<i>In fact, it only drives you to try harder.</i>

38:50.911 --> 38:52.538
<i>You make me sound like a sadist.</i>

38:53.080 --> 38:54.999
<i>[chuckles] No.</i>

38:57.084 --> 39:00.296
<i>You see, for eons,</i>
<i>I was God's right hand, you know?</i>

39:00.713 --> 39:04.592
<i>And for most of the time, I had no idea</i>
<i>why I was doing what I was doing.</i>

39:06.052 --> 39:07.636
<i>But watching your perseverance,</i>

39:07.720 --> 39:10.264
<i>to see you keep digging</i>
<i>for the truth, it's...</i>

39:11.057 --> 39:12.767
<i>[exhales] ...it's inspiring.</i>

39:13.267 --> 39:16.687
<i>And I wish I would have had</i>
<i>the same curiosity, because then...</i>

39:17.897 --> 39:21.108
<i>maybe I would have had the answers</i>
<i>that you're asking for, Chloe.</i>

39:24.945 --> 39:26.405
<i>But unfortunately, I don't.</i>

39:29.742 --> 39:31.202
<i>And neither does Lucifer.</i>

39:31.619 --> 39:34.288
<i>-[Lucifer] I know who the killer is.</i>
<i>-[Dan] </i>We<i> know who the killer is.</i>

39:34.372 --> 39:35.581
<i>-We.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

39:35.664 --> 39:38.459
<i>Okay, so that mysterious contusion</i>
<i>around Victoria's neck?</i>

39:38.542 --> 39:39.627
<i>It's consistent with a ring.</i>

39:39.710 --> 39:40.753
<i>An engagement ring,</i>

39:40.836 --> 39:43.756
<i>which you wear around your neck to stop</i>
<i>goats from eating it off your hand.</i>

39:43.839 --> 39:45.508
<i>Or when you're undercover in a nunnery.</i>

39:45.591 --> 39:47.301
<i>Those aren't the only two reasons,</i>
<i>obviously.</i>

39:47.718 --> 39:49.011
<i>Bracelet bros for the win.</i>

39:49.095 --> 39:50.054
<i>[mock explosions]</i>

39:51.472 --> 39:57.686
<i>Well, I could see why a fiancé would be</i>
<i>upset she had embraced the life of a nun.</i>

39:58.437 --> 39:59.772
<i>However, we have no proof,</i>

40:00.189 --> 40:02.108
<i>no idea who the fiancé is.</i>

40:02.191 --> 40:04.485
<i>We don't even know if the fiancé </i>
<i>is a "him."</i>

40:04.568 --> 40:05.778
<i>-[Lucifer] Right.</i>
<i>-So for now--</i>

40:05.861 --> 40:07.238
<i>-[Sister Francine] Excuse me.</i>
<i>-Yeah?</i>

40:08.030 --> 40:10.991
<i>Is there somewhere we could speak</i>
<i>in private?</i>

40:11.575 --> 40:14.703
<i>-Of course.</i>
<i>-I... I meant with him.</i>

40:21.752 --> 40:22.670
<i>You're nervous.</i>

40:23.879 --> 40:25.506
<i>It's all right, Sister Francine.</i>

40:25.589 --> 40:26.507
<i>You can trust me.</i>

40:28.050 --> 40:30.094
<i>I've wanted to do this</i>
<i>ever since I met you,</i>

40:30.553 --> 40:31.554
<i>but I'm scared.</i>

40:31.637 --> 40:32.638
<i>I understand.</i>

40:32.721 --> 40:33.973
<i>I do, but listen...</i>

40:35.015 --> 40:38.894
<i>once you admit the truth, you are</i>
<i>gonna be amazed at how good it feels.</i>

40:40.521 --> 40:42.231
<i>I've never done anything like this before.</i>

40:42.815 --> 40:43.732
<i>I haven't, either.</i>

40:44.191 --> 40:45.192
<i>It's just...</i>

40:46.152 --> 40:47.695
<i>I'm a woman of faith.</i>

40:48.237 --> 40:50.156
<i>Well, you see, that's all the more reason.</i>

40:51.615 --> 40:53.951
<i>Because you, Sister Francine,</i>

40:54.326 --> 40:57.621
<i>you of all people know</i>
<i>what you need to do.</i>

40:59.957 --> 41:01.876
<i>[trembling breaths] Right here?</i>

<i>Right now?</i>

41:05.754 --> 41:06.589
<i>Yes.</i>

41:07.673 --> 41:08.924
<i>Just let it all go.</i>

<i>-Wow.</i>
<i>-[grunts repeatedly]</i>

41:18.142 --> 41:20.769
<i>[Amenadiel straining]</i>

41:20.853 --> 41:22.146
<i>Let him put in the work.</i>

<i>[Amenadiel grunting]</i>

41:28.319 --> 41:29.278
<i>What are you doing?</i>

41:30.029 --> 41:30.905
<i>I'm letting go.</i>

41:31.447 --> 41:32.406
<i>Like you said, I...</i>

41:32.490 --> 41:35.367
<i>I'm admitting the truth</i>
<i>of my feelings for you.</i>

41:35.451 --> 41:37.244
<i>That's-- That's not what I meant.</i>

41:39.997 --> 41:41.040
<i>This is wrong.</i>

41:42.041 --> 41:44.043
<i>[shuddering breaths]</i>

41:45.920 --> 41:46.837
<i>I'm a nun.</i>

41:47.546 --> 41:49.131
<i>I love God, it's just...</i>

41:50.758 --> 41:51.884
<i>when I look at you, I...</i>

41:52.635 --> 41:54.470
<i>get this feeling</i>
<i>that I've never had before.</i>

41:56.597 --> 41:58.224
<i>What does that say about me?</i>

42:02.061 --> 42:03.187
<i>What are you feeling?</i>

42:03.604 --> 42:05.189
<i>It's going to sound absurd, but...</i>

42:05.898 --> 42:08.067
<i>I feel as if I'm closer to God.</i>

42:11.779 --> 42:13.239
<i>But that's not exactly it, it's--</i>

42:13.322 --> 42:16.242
<i>Like your love for God</i>
<i>is being reflected back at you...</i>

42:18.869 --> 42:19.787
<i>through me.</i>

42:21.830 --> 42:22.665
<i>Yes.</i>

42:24.041 --> 42:25.167
<i>That's exactly it.</i>

42:25.668 --> 42:26.794
<i>How did you know that?</i>

42:27.253 --> 42:29.880
<i>I didn't even know that</i>
<i>until you just said it out loud.</i>

42:33.092 --> 42:34.760
<i>I'm starting to understand something.</i>

42:38.472 --> 42:41.559
<i>Wait, this is what you came to talk about?</i>

42:41.642 --> 42:43.143
<i>What did you think I came for?</i>

42:43.227 --> 42:44.770
<i>The murder of Sister Victoria.</i>

42:46.855 --> 42:47.982
<i>I wish I could help.</i>

42:49.024 --> 42:49.942
<i>Maybe you can.</i>

42:50.734 --> 42:53.320
<i>Did she ever mention a boyfriend?</i>
<i>A fiancé?</i>

42:54.613 --> 42:55.948
<i>What about any visitors?</i>

42:56.031 --> 42:57.366
<i>She usually liked to be alone.</i>

42:58.242 --> 43:01.745
<i>She did say that she discovered</i>
<i>a secret room no one knew about, and...</i>

43:02.746 --> 43:04.582
<i>she liked to go there to be by herself.</i>

43:05.249 --> 43:06.125
<i>Thank you.</i>

43:06.208 --> 43:08.919
<i>So if Sister Victoria knew</i>
<i>about a secret room...</i>

43:09.003 --> 43:11.463
<i>Seems like the perfect place</i>
<i>to meet a secret fiancé.</i>

43:11.547 --> 43:14.258
<i>Find the room, maybe we can find</i>
<i>some evidence to ID him.</i>

43:14.341 --> 43:15.301
<i>Yeah.</i>

43:27.187 --> 43:29.273
<i>Lucifer, I know what you're thinking.</i>

43:30.232 --> 43:32.276
<i>That once this case is solved,</i>

43:32.943 --> 43:36.989
<i>I'll have magically figured everything out</i>
<i>and it'll all be fine, right?</i>

43:37.072 --> 43:40.159
<i>Well, I'm definitely not</i>
<i>thinking that now.</i>

43:43.412 --> 43:44.288
<i>I...</i>

43:45.331 --> 43:46.665
<i>I want us to be together.</i>

<i>I just don't...</i>

43:51.670 --> 43:54.256
<i>I don't know how long</i>
<i>it's going to take me to get over this.</i>

<i>You do?</i>

<i>There are no shortcuts.</i>

<i>Just... take all the time you need.</i>

44:09.104 --> 44:10.230
<i>Are you sure?</i>

44:12.274 --> 44:13.108
<i>Okay.</i>

44:26.789 --> 44:28.165
<i>It's gotta be here.</i>

44:29.083 --> 44:31.418
<i>It's gotta be here somewhere.</i>

<i>[Amenadiel] How'd you find this?</i>

44:49.978 --> 44:53.065
<i>Well, I realized that Destiny Page</i>
<i>might have the blueprints</i>

44:53.148 --> 44:55.192
<i>since she was interested</i>
<i>in buying the building.</i>

44:55.859 --> 44:57.611
<i>[Amenadiel]</i>
<i>And since Victoria worked for her,</i>

44:57.695 --> 44:59.405
<i>that's how she knew</i>
<i>about the secret place.</i>

44:59.863 --> 45:02.157
<i>Yeah, and one call to her reps,</i>

<i>bingo.</i>

45:08.455 --> 45:10.874
<i>Okay, so what are we looking for here?</i>

45:11.166 --> 45:12.668
<i>Something out of place.</i>

45:13.335 --> 45:14.628
<i>Something new.</i>

45:15.796 --> 45:18.966
<i>Something a nun wouldn't have.</i>

45:23.095 --> 45:24.471
<i>Something...</i>

45:26.849 --> 45:28.350
<i>with fingerprints.</i>

45:29.351 --> 45:31.812
<i>[Hank] I really wish you hadn't found that</i>
<i>before me.</i>

45:32.187 --> 45:33.188
<i>-[Chloe sighs]</i>
<i>-[gun cocks]</i>

45:39.236 --> 45:40.070
<i>Hi, Hank.</i>

45:41.321 --> 45:44.616
<i>I guess when I asked for the blueprints...</i>

45:45.617 --> 45:47.119
<i>you figured out what I was looking for.</i>

45:47.703 --> 45:48.537
<i>Yeah.</i>

45:49.913 --> 45:53.417
<i>Did Destiny Page know</i>
<i>that you were engaged to her assistant?</i>

45:53.876 --> 45:56.837
<i>Nah, she was too busy working on</i>
<i>her religious image all day,</i>

45:57.379 --> 45:59.089
<i>getting hammered all night to notice.</i>

45:59.173 --> 46:00.758
<i>Not much of a believer, huh?</i>

46:00.841 --> 46:02.843
<i>Oh, it's such a scam.</i>

46:04.052 --> 46:06.054
<i>Victoria thought so, too,</i>
<i>until she came here.</i>

46:06.138 --> 46:08.265
<i>She broke up with you, and you killed her?</i>

46:08.348 --> 46:10.768
<i>I just wanted to talk some sense into her,</i>

46:10.851 --> 46:12.144
<i>but we started to fight,</i>

46:12.603 --> 46:14.062
<i>and I wanted the ring back. I...</i>

46:15.230 --> 46:16.982
<i>I didn't mean to push her so hard.</i>

46:18.525 --> 46:19.485
<i>Why?</i>

46:20.027 --> 46:22.237
<i>Why would she choose this place over me?</i>

46:22.321 --> 46:23.322
<i>We had something real.</i>

46:23.739 --> 46:24.990
<i>Instead, she left me for</i>

46:25.365 --> 46:26.742
<i>made-up nonsense!</i>

46:26.825 --> 46:28.869
<i>I think we've heard enough, right?</i>

46:29.620 --> 46:30.621
<i>Plenty.</i>

46:33.040 --> 46:36.710
<i>Now, that is very gentlemanly of you...</i>

46:37.753 --> 46:39.004
<i>to die first.</i>

46:43.926 --> 46:44.760
<i>[Chloe gasps]</i>

46:46.720 --> 46:47.930
<i>How the hell?</i>

46:48.013 --> 46:49.681
<i>What if it wasn't fake?</i>

46:51.433 --> 46:55.771
<i>What if it was more real than even</i>
<i>she could possibly know, and you, Hank,</i>

46:56.355 --> 46:58.857
<i>-you took that away from her?</i>
<i>-No, no, no...</i>

46:59.942 --> 47:01.235
<i>It's impossible.</i>

47:03.070 --> 47:04.071
<i>[gasps]</i>

47:05.906 --> 47:07.032
<i>[Hank] Oh, God.</i>

47:09.701 --> 47:11.036
<i>Have faith, Hank.</i>

47:11.495 --> 47:12.621
<i>No.</i>

47:13.497 --> 47:14.331
<i>[grunts]</i>

47:28.053 --> 47:29.179
<i>[police chatter on radio]</i>

47:30.639 --> 47:31.890
<i>Get him away from me.</i>

47:33.141 --> 47:35.102
<i>Stay away from me! [grunts]</i>

47:36.937 --> 47:39.565
<i>I thought you weren't supposed</i>
<i>to expose yourself.</i>

47:40.399 --> 47:41.316
<i>Oh, I'm not.</i>

47:42.317 --> 47:44.570
<i>But for what he did, it felt appropriate.</i>

47:46.154 --> 47:47.197
<i>Yeah, well...</i>

47:47.948 --> 47:52.494
<i>When you find out that it all</i>
<i>really does exist, it can be punishing.</i>

47:52.578 --> 47:54.121
<i>Trust me on that.</i>

47:55.706 --> 47:56.540
<i>Yeah.</i>

47:57.457 --> 47:59.042
<i>I wanted to talk to you about that.</i>

48:00.460 --> 48:02.629
<i>Chloe, I think I know why</i>
<i>the nuns were drawn to me.</i>

48:03.297 --> 48:04.131
<i>Why is that?</i>

48:04.214 --> 48:08.886
<i>Sister Francine said she felt God's love</i>
<i>more than ever when she was with me.</i>

48:08.969 --> 48:11.555
<i>You know, when she was in my presence.</i>

48:11.638 --> 48:12.723
<i>Well... [chuckles]</i>

48:13.432 --> 48:15.559
<i>Yes, you are an angel.</i>

48:15.893 --> 48:19.146
<i>I am, but I'm pretty sure that</i>
<i>she was seeing her own faith</i>

48:19.771 --> 48:21.106
<i>reflected back at her.</i>

48:22.941 --> 48:23.775
<i>Okay.</i>

48:24.151 --> 48:25.736
<i>Why-- Why do you say that?</i>

48:26.361 --> 48:28.113
<i>Lucifer, actually.</i>

48:28.614 --> 48:33.368
<i>Men, women, they're all drawn to him</i>
<i>because he pulls out people's desires.</i>

48:33.493 --> 48:36.079
<i>But what if the reason that</i>
<i>they're drawn to him</i>

48:36.830 --> 48:38.040
<i>is because of that?</i>

48:38.916 --> 48:40.375
<i>So you're saying Lucifer...</i>

48:41.251 --> 48:43.503
<i>reflects people's desires back to them?</i>

48:44.004 --> 48:46.506
<i>Well, who wouldn't want to be</i>
<i>with their greatest desire?</i>

48:47.049 --> 48:48.008
<i>Well, yes, I...</i>

48:48.842 --> 48:53.055
<i>I agree, but when I look at him,</i>
<i>I-I-I don't see that.</i>

48:56.350 --> 48:57.351
<i>Which would mean that...</i>

48:57.434 --> 49:00.103
<i>That you're the only mortal</i>
<i>who sees him...</i>

49:01.313 --> 49:03.065
<i>for who he truly is.</i>

49:04.816 --> 49:05.817
<i>[gasps]</i>

49:07.694 --> 49:08.654
<i>So...</i>

49:09.655 --> 49:12.282
<i>So everything we shared and...</i>

49:14.618 --> 49:17.537
<i>Everything I was afraid</i>
<i>was a manipulation--</i>

49:17.621 --> 49:19.122
<i>Is as real as it gets.</i>

49:20.916 --> 49:24.127
<i>You're not the gift, Chloe.</i>

49:25.879 --> 49:26.713
<i>That is.</i>

49:36.056 --> 49:37.099
<i>Yes, but I...</i>

49:38.225 --> 49:39.810
<i>But I make him vulnerable.</i>

49:41.853 --> 49:44.064
<i>That's something else</i>
<i>I wanted to talk to you about.</i>

49:51.071 --> 49:51.947
<i>What's this?</i>

49:52.572 --> 49:55.158
<i>A database release form</i>
<i>for biological parents.</i>

49:56.284 --> 49:59.204
<i>So that their adopted kids can find them</i>
<i>if they want to.</i>

49:59.871 --> 50:02.249
<i>It's like bounty hunting</i>
<i>for your mother and father.</i>

50:03.500 --> 50:04.459
<i>[sighs]</i>

50:07.045 --> 50:08.463
<i>Thank you, Maze.</i>

50:10.632 --> 50:11.842
<i>This is perfect.</i>

50:14.052 --> 50:17.472
<i>You need to give your daughter</i>
<i>the choice...</i>

50:18.390 --> 50:19.266
<i>okay?</i>

50:20.183 --> 50:21.101
<i>You have to.</i>

50:25.814 --> 50:27.566
<i>You saw your mother, didn't you?</i>

50:32.821 --> 50:34.156
<i>What did you say to her?</i>

50:34.990 --> 50:35.824
<i>Nothing.</i>

50:37.451 --> 50:39.953
<i>I didn't get to say that "I hate you."</i>

50:40.746 --> 50:42.539
<i>I didn't get to say that "I forgive you."</i>

50:42.622 --> 50:45.584
<i>I didn't get to say anything.</i>

50:51.089 --> 50:52.174
<i>Because she's gone.</i>

50:54.885 --> 50:56.303
<i>She died, Linda.</i>

51:06.063 --> 51:06.938
<i>[sobs]</i>

51:11.401 --> 51:13.195

51:32.422 --> 51:33.465
<i>Hi, Lucifer.</i>

51:35.258 --> 51:36.134
<i>Detective.</i>

51:36.843 --> 51:38.428
<i>You mind if I sit?</i>

51:39.763 --> 51:40.597
<i>Please.</i>

51:46.645 --> 51:47.521
<i>[Chloe clears throat]</i>

51:49.689 --> 51:51.066
<i>Well, I had a...</i>

51:51.983 --> 51:54.569
<i>interesting conversation with Amenadiel.</i>

51:55.362 --> 51:57.697
<i>Please tell me you're not making him</i>
<i>police consultant.</i>

51:57.781 --> 51:59.407
<i>-Anything but that.</i>
<i>-[chuckles]</i>

52:01.701 --> 52:04.663
<i>No, actually. He has, um, a theory</i>

52:05.330 --> 52:07.541
<i>about why I make you vulnerable.</i>

52:08.834 --> 52:10.418
<i>Oh. Do tell.</i>

52:11.962 --> 52:12.796
<i>Well...</i>

52:14.214 --> 52:16.508
<i>His theory is that...</i>

52:17.300 --> 52:18.176
<i>I don't.</i>

52:19.261 --> 52:22.055
<i>Well, I have many scars</i>
<i>to prove otherwise.</i>

52:22.472 --> 52:23.348
<i>[both chuckle]</i>

52:25.225 --> 52:26.601
<i>He thinks that...</i>

52:27.978 --> 52:31.565
<i>you choose to be vulnerable around me.</i>

52:32.983 --> 52:34.776
<i>I </i>choose <i>to...</i>

52:40.490 --> 52:41.867
<i>Well, I'll be damned.</i>

52:43.743 --> 52:45.328
<i>I think he might be right.</i>

52:46.872 --> 52:48.456
<i>I... [chuckles]</i>

<i>Detective.</i>
