41:00.719 --> 41:03.286
-[Bill] Georgie.
-Oh, shut it, Bill.

41:03.373 --> 41:05.854
No point trying to stuff it
back in your pants now.

41:05.985 --> 41:08.944
What you doin' here,
all the way in Chucaloosa?

41:09.031 --> 41:10.859
-I mean Lissa.
-[Georgie] Well, clearly,

41:10.990 --> 41:13.862
I can't trust you
and your merry band of dipshits

41:13.993 --> 41:16.474
to handle any other tasks
of import.

41:16.604 --> 41:18.476
-[knocking]
-What now?

41:26.222 --> 41:28.877
Oh, you gone be

41:29.008 --> 41:30.444
Long as you keep these comin'.

41:30.575 --> 41:32.794
[Corbin]
Mrs. Batson, I'm Corbin Kyle.

41:35.318 --> 41:37.059
That 'sposed to mean
somethin' to me?

41:37.146 --> 41:38.844
And, uh, this is Andre Watkins,

41:38.974 --> 41:40.323
next mayor of Chucalissa.

41:40.454 --> 41:42.282
[Georgie]
Oh, I know who that is.

41:42.412 --> 41:43.718
That's the lawyer
who fucked our acquisition

41:43.805 --> 41:46.112
of waterfront property.

41:46.242 --> 41:47.635
Well, if I only had been
given authorization

41:47.722 --> 41:49.115
to bid more than 250,000.

41:49.245 --> 41:51.030
I tried callin' Bill, but--

41:51.160 --> 41:53.293
[Georgie] Oh, but he was busy
nailin' his ugly-ass wife

41:53.423 --> 41:56.165
to the bed in fuckin'
Bora Bora, wun't he?

41:56.296 --> 41:58.907
[laughs] Next time, Andre,
don't ask for permission.

41:59.038 --> 42:02.128
Take it.
I learned that from Oprah.

42:02.258 --> 42:04.565
But, actually, I think
things worked out for the best.

42:04.696 --> 42:06.785
You see, Bill over there

42:06.915 --> 42:08.917
was trying to buy The Pynk
for just 40K.

42:09.048 --> 42:10.528
Now, imagine the public outcry

42:10.658 --> 42:12.965
if that leaked to, say, CNN,

42:13.095 --> 42:15.750
that Promised Land
was basically stealing

42:15.881 --> 42:18.057
from Black landowners

42:18.187 --> 42:19.232
in the poorest county,
in the poorest state.

42:19.362 --> 42:20.407
-I--
-[Georgie] Bill,

42:20.494 --> 42:22.452
just shut the fuck up!

42:22.583 --> 42:25.586
Fortunately, I'm the owner now.

42:25.717 --> 42:28.284
[gasps] Oh! Wait, wait, wait.

42:28.415 --> 42:30.504
You're not the cigar girl,
are you?

42:30.635 --> 42:31.853
Maybe in another life.

42:31.984 --> 42:33.986
But tonight...

42:34.116 --> 42:36.728
LaKiesha Savage is the name.

42:36.858 --> 42:39.861
This pandemic certainly created

42:39.992 --> 42:41.907
a silver lining
in that Promised Land

42:41.994 --> 42:43.648
now has the time
to make things right.

42:43.778 --> 42:45.084
Make what right?

42:45.214 --> 42:48.043
Pay me what it's truly worth.

42:48.174 --> 42:50.524
What was it, Mr. Watkins?

42:50.655 --> 42:52.134
Ten million dollars.

42:52.265 --> 42:55.747
[Georgie] Haha!
Well, Miss Savage. Ha.

42:55.877 --> 42:57.836
Now, don't you worry
about ole Bill over there.

42:57.966 --> 43:00.926

as my husband.

43:01.056 --> 43:04.059

make you a muchbetter deal.

43:11.589 --> 43:14.200
Hmm? Alrighty then.

43:14.330 --> 43:16.637

as much cigar smoke

43:16.768 --> 43:18.857

as I can handle.

43:18.987 --> 43:20.598

43:20.728 --> 43:22.991
