00:04.440 --> 00:07.046
My sister's a ghost
and I never got to say goodbye.

00:10.520 --> 00:12.807
- Matt, please.
- Matt.

00:13.800 --> 00:14.847
Vicki?

00:16.239 --> 00:19.084
They're looking for Mikael.
The vampire who hunts vampires.

00:19.240 --> 00:21.766
You don't wanna wake him.
He will kill all of you.

00:21.920 --> 00:23.604
Elena's blood. Drink it.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.447
Good boy.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.121
That's a good sign.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.971
He's ï¬‚ipped a switch.
Stefan is gone, not coming back.

00:31.120 --> 00:33.282
You can fight it.
You have to want it enough.

00:33.440 --> 00:35.920
- Because I love you?
- Right, because you love me.

00:36.080 --> 00:39.926
Only thing stronger than the craving
for blood is your love for this one girl.

00:40.080 --> 00:42.811
- Turn it off.
- No!

00:45.240 --> 00:46.480
Turn it off!

00:46.640 --> 00:49.211
- What did you do?
- I fixed him.

01:36.800 --> 01:38.529
Good morning.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.841
The pressure of your punch
ejects the stakes.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.690
Easy enough.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.964
That's weird.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.881
- Must be jammed or something.
- You're not strong enough.

02:04.920 --> 02:08.163
Better start lifting some weights.
Put some meat on your bones.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.723
Thanks for not sugarcoating it.

02:10.880 --> 02:11.881
You know what this is?

02:12.040 --> 02:13.963
A vervain grenade.
I've used one before.

02:14.120 --> 02:17.886
Then you know the element of surprise
is your only advantage.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.408
- Surprise.
- Oh, my God.

02:25.240 --> 02:27.004
This isn't a joke to me, Ric.

02:27.160 --> 02:28.241
You think I'm joking?

02:28.440 --> 02:30.044
Vampires take whatever they want.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.806
They hurt whoever they want.
And do it without remorse.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.480
- It's their nature.
- You don't have to use pronouns.

02:35.640 --> 02:39.167
- You can say Stefan.
- Look, I get why you're here.

02:40.520 --> 02:43.000
Stefan hurt you.
You don't want it to happen again.

02:43.160 --> 02:46.243
But you think I'm crazy
to believe I can protect myself...

02:46.440 --> 02:49.762
from a vampire who's ï¬‚ipped
the switch on his humanity.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.605
I think you found a way
to get out of bed this morning.

02:52.760 --> 02:55.001
And that makes you
the strongest person I know.

02:56.440 --> 02:59.922
I think that you can do
pretty much anything.

03:30.280 --> 03:33.807
Here we are. Senior year.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.800
Anyone else think this should feel
slightly more empowering?

03:38.720 --> 03:40.563
Okay, so prank night was a bust.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.246
But we are accepting it
and we're moving on.

03:43.400 --> 03:47.325
You're right. Why should I let the fact
that my boyfriend is seeing the ghost...

03:47.480 --> 03:49.642
of his girlfriends
hinder this experience?

03:49.800 --> 03:53.486
Yes. And why should I let the fact
my boyfriend was turned into a hybrid...

03:53.640 --> 03:57.008
put a damper
on an otherwise fabulous day?

03:57.160 --> 03:58.321
Today's our anniversary.

04:00.160 --> 04:04.404
Technically, Stefan and I met
on the first day of school last year.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.129
Yeah, you win.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.930
Are you sure you want to be here?

04:09.080 --> 04:11.845
I have to be here.
I have to put it behind me.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.811
New year, new life.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.810
Yeah.

04:40.920 --> 04:45.050
Uh-oh. Alexandra. Left hand, please.

04:47.200 --> 04:50.170
Hey, the two brunettes on the staircase
owe me a Persian rug.

04:52.360 --> 04:56.126
You mean they owe us a Persian rug.
It's my house, too, brother.

04:56.280 --> 04:58.806
Ooh. Would you like a spin?

04:58.960 --> 05:02.362
This is what Klaus had in mind when
he compelled you to protect Elena?

05:02.520 --> 05:05.729
These ladies are helping me
be all that I can be.

05:15.160 --> 05:17.049
- Where's Stefan?
- Who the hell are you?

05:17.200 --> 05:20.329
He left me here.
My brother actually left me here.

05:20.480 --> 05:24.929
I'm sorry, your tone implies
that I'm actually supposed to care.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.645
You're Klaus' sister?

05:27.160 --> 05:29.003
Rebekah. Pleasure, I'm sure.

05:29.160 --> 05:32.004
- Which one's my room?
- You're not staying here.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.761
Rude. Both of you.

05:36.680 --> 05:38.682
I'll see to it myself.

05:41.400 --> 05:42.765
I guess she's staying here.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.570
So, what, it's not cool
to talk to juniors anymore?

05:50.720 --> 05:53.451
Hey. Happy first day.

05:54.040 --> 05:56.407
- You're mad.
- I'm not. I'm resigned to the fact...

05:56.560 --> 05:59.450
I'm sharing space
in our relationship with Anna and Vicki.

05:59.640 --> 06:02.928
- I haven't talked to Vicki in a while.
- Not the point, Jeremy.

06:03.080 --> 06:06.562
Look, I know that. I know. Okay?
But I had to see Anna again, Bonnie.

06:06.760 --> 06:12.164
- She had information Damon needed.
- I get it, but put yourself in my shoes.

06:12.440 --> 06:16.889
You loved both of them.
And you guys didn't break up, they died.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.202
And you keep letting them back in.

06:19.360 --> 06:22.125
Do you think I want any of this?

06:22.280 --> 06:25.602
I think you have the power to decide
whether or not you see them.

06:26.880 --> 06:30.601
Remember that, okay?

06:47.800 --> 06:50.770
You were always better
at being a part of this than I was.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.406
Sorry

06:53.560 --> 06:56.484
You can't just keep appearing like this.
It freaks me out.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.404
I'm a ghost. It's all I got.

06:58.600 --> 07:01.285
And I couldn't appear
if you weren't thinking about me.

07:01.480 --> 07:05.246
I was just thinking about
our first day last year.

07:05.440 --> 07:07.920
I was worried about running into Elena
and you said...

07:08.080 --> 07:11.527
Suck it up, be a man,
and show her what she's missing.

07:11.680 --> 07:14.524
Yeah, and instead she met a vampire.

07:16.680 --> 07:17.966
You okay, Matty?

07:18.160 --> 07:19.605
You seem unhappy.

07:19.760 --> 07:24.209
Yeah, just life stuff.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.724
You know, with you gone
and Mom not around...

07:28.120 --> 07:29.884
it's a lot to deal with alone.

07:30.960 --> 07:34.442
I'm glad I get to talk to you, though.
I miss you.

07:34.640 --> 07:36.165
I miss you too.

07:40.480 --> 07:43.882
What if I told you there was a way
that you could help me come back?

07:44.040 --> 07:45.724
What do you mean, come back?

07:46.360 --> 07:47.691
Donovan.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.888
What are you doing?
Come on, man, let's go.

07:55.520 --> 07:57.409
You talking to yourself?

07:57.560 --> 07:59.528
What's got you in such a good mood?

07:59.680 --> 08:03.048
We're seniors, man. Life is good.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.842
Come on, Mikael. Breakfast.

08:10.360 --> 08:11.566
Yummy.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.723
Mikael, wake up.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.321
- What?
- "What?"

08:17.480 --> 08:19.403
I've been calling you for two days.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.046
That's exactly how long
I've been ignoring you.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.168
Jeremy told me
that you found Mikael.

08:24.320 --> 08:26.448
<i>Sort of.
He's a little out of commission.</i>

08:26.600 --> 08:29.171
He won't eat.
And I've tried everything.

08:29.360 --> 08:33.284
Gravediggers, mourners, mice, rats, bats.
He's just not interested.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.602
Well, try harder.
We need him to kill Klaus...

08:35.799 --> 08:39.441
so I can de-rippefy Stefan
before he destroys my house.

08:41.200 --> 08:44.568
Fine. I'll give it another shot.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.441
Hey. Are you checking up on me?
Because I'm fine.

08:52.600 --> 08:56.969
Yeah, so you might not wanna
come here for a while.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.646
We have a new housemate.
Barbie-Klaus.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.446
Rebekah? She's living with you now?
Why?

09:02.640 --> 09:03.721
<i>She's stranded.</i>

09:03.880 --> 09:07.123
Apparently, Klaus left her in the dust
after I name-dropped Mikael.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.282
What about Stefan? What's he up to?

09:10.480 --> 09:14.451
Oh, you know Stefan.
Journaling. Reading. Shaping his hair.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.443
Come on, Damon, I can handle it.
What?

09:16.600 --> 09:19.570
Was that the bell? Ring, ring.
Don't wanna be late.

09:28.760 --> 09:31.127
I forgot about the bonfire.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.851
You have to go.
It's our first spirit squad event.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.846
- And it sets the bar for the whole year...
- Relax, Caroline. I'll be there.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.365
Thank you. it's just that...

09:41.680 --> 09:43.648
Happy first day.

09:44.360 --> 09:46.886
- Is that blood?
- Oh, my God.

09:50.280 --> 09:51.770
- What's going on?
- Vampire 101.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.684
Don't wear your breakfast to school.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.922
- Chill out, it was a blood bag.
- From where?

09:56.080 --> 09:57.923
- Rebekah hooked me up.
- Rebekah?

09:58.080 --> 10:00.082
And what
are you even talking to her for?

10:00.280 --> 10:01.930
Klaus told her to keep watch on me.

10:02.120 --> 10:03.804
- Protect his new asset.
- His what?

10:03.960 --> 10:05.485
Why are you amused by this?

10:05.640 --> 10:08.291
I'm his first successful hybrid,
Caroline.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.124
Don't you think that's awesome?

10:10.360 --> 10:11.521
Oh, wow.

10:11.680 --> 10:15.526
- I cannot believe you just said that.
- So I'm gonna go.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.445
Good luck.

10:24.880 --> 10:26.530
Hello, Elena.

10:28.480 --> 10:29.845
What are you doing here?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.048
What do you mean?
I'm going back to school.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.043
- Go Timberwolves.
- What? Why?

10:34.200 --> 10:37.204
Klaus wants me to keep an eye on you.
I'm doing what I'm told.

10:37.440 --> 10:41.047
- I'm gonna be late for class.
- Oh, uh, class is this way.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.242
Let go of me, Stefan.

10:43.440 --> 10:46.523
Elena, do you think I wanna be a senior
for the hundredth time?

10:46.680 --> 10:49.684
No. But if I don't have a choice
in the matter, neither do you.

10:49.840 --> 10:53.003
- I said let go of me.
- Let her go.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.081
Stefan, stop it.

11:01.440 --> 11:05.331
You're not gonna want to get
in my way, okay, Ric?

11:07.200 --> 11:10.090
I will see you both in History.

11:20.320 --> 11:23.483
What the hell is he doing here?
- Klaus compelled him to watch me.

11:23.680 --> 11:27.651
I'm one of Klaus' assets now that my
blood is the only way to create a hybrid.

11:27.800 --> 11:30.963
- So now he's a bodyguard?
- I don't know, but he's not Stefan.

11:33.080 --> 11:36.323
Look, his being here is not good for us.
We have to do something.

11:46.760 --> 11:47.841
You're in my seat.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.122
Hey, you.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.165
Welcome back, seniors.

11:59.360 --> 12:03.331
Let's turn our brains back on, starting
with this country's original founders.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.801
- The Native Americans.
- What about the Vikings?

12:06.240 --> 12:08.129
There's no evidence
Viking explorers...

12:08.280 --> 12:10.851
actually settled in the United States.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.482
- Who are you?
- My name's Rebekah.

12:14.640 --> 12:18.008
I'm new.
And history is my favorite subject.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.841
You have got no business
in the stoner pit.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.685
- Figured you'd feel comfortable here.
- Touche.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.527
What did you mean
that I can help you come back?

12:43.960 --> 12:47.248
Right now I can only come back
when you're thinking of me.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.370
- But there is a way I could be free of that.
- How?

12:50.520 --> 12:53.205
This sounds crazy,
but I have help from the other side.

12:53.360 --> 12:54.646
The other side?

12:55.200 --> 12:56.850
Dude, what are you doing over here?

12:59.520 --> 13:03.366
- I could ask you the same question.
- Just looking for my stoner lab partner.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.362
All right, see you around.

13:11.160 --> 13:13.731
- Can he not see you anymore?
- He was talking to Vicki.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.326
- Right out there in the open.
- How?

13:16.520 --> 13:19.410
When he died and came back,
he must've started seeing her.

13:19.560 --> 13:23.007
She said that she could come back.
That she had help on the other side.

13:23.160 --> 13:25.891
Help? What kind of help?

13:26.040 --> 13:27.201
Who's helping you?

13:27.360 --> 13:29.681
The witch I've been to
says there's a ritual.

13:29.840 --> 13:33.083
She can do magic from my side
to push me over to yours.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.561
Is it even possible?
Could she come back?

13:35.720 --> 13:38.451
- I guess if she had a stronger foothold.
- Like an anchor?

13:38.600 --> 13:40.682
Exactly. Right now I'm tethered to you.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.201
My only access point to your side
is through you.

13:43.360 --> 13:45.522
But if she were to get
a stronger foothold...

13:45.680 --> 13:49.571
I'll be able to come and go
as I please, when I want, where I want.

13:49.760 --> 13:52.650
- I won't have to rely on you.
- You'll still be a ghost, Vick.

13:52.840 --> 13:55.081
In a town of vampires, werewolves
and witches.

13:55.240 --> 13:56.924
I'll fit right in.

13:57.080 --> 13:59.481
Seriously?
You're gonna make jokes about this?

13:59.640 --> 14:01.244
Matt, relax.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.249
No one else will be able to see me.

14:03.440 --> 14:06.762
She's bad news, Jeremy.
There's nothing but darkness around her.

14:06.920 --> 14:08.604
This is Vicki we're talking about.

14:08.760 --> 14:09.886
She's not a bad person.

14:10.040 --> 14:13.328
You can't upset the balance of nature
without a price.

14:13.480 --> 14:16.131
If she's using a witch's energy
from the other side...

14:16.280 --> 14:18.487
you don't know what price
she agreed to pay.

14:18.640 --> 14:21.120
I can be a part of this life again, Matt.

14:21.280 --> 14:24.602
Instead of being on the other side
all alone.

14:25.120 --> 14:26.804
You won't have to be alone either.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.645
What do I have to do?

14:55.320 --> 14:56.765
Has anybody seen Dana?

14:58.920 --> 15:01.526
Sounds like you have an opening
on the squad.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.769
What are you doing?

15:05.120 --> 15:06.610
Hey. He)'...

15:09.520 --> 15:12.046
You can't just come
and infiltrate all of our lives.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.282
I'm only interested in yours.

15:14.440 --> 15:17.489
Your spunk. Your popularity.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.850
Maybe even your boyfriend.

15:23.680 --> 15:27.446
It's not the ballet, ladies.
Let's move, let's move.

15:28.680 --> 15:29.886
I think we're done here.

15:30.040 --> 15:32.202
You have a mental breakdown?
Get in line.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.647
Got a better idea.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.807
Shut up so we can
go get drunk at the bonfire.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.087
Hit the showers, gentlemen.

15:49.560 --> 15:53.201
- Try to be a little more subtle, Tyler.
- Coming from the queen of subtlety?

15:53.360 --> 15:55.203
Relax. I'm in total control.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.885
- Then why are you acting like this?
- Drop it, Caroline.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.042
I'm fine. I've never been better.

16:01.200 --> 16:05.171
- Klaus has given me this gift.
- Wait. What?

16:05.320 --> 16:06.731
Hey, check out the new girl.

16:06.880 --> 16:09.850
Come on, Rebekah, you got this.

16:16.400 --> 16:21.725
- Oh, my God.
- Damn. Girl's got moves.

16:31.280 --> 16:33.760
Look at you being all fit.

16:34.120 --> 16:35.929
Are you going to the bonfire tonight?

16:36.080 --> 16:39.243
- Sounds like fun, right?
- Seriously, Stefan, leave me alone.

16:40.240 --> 16:42.720
You think I'm annoying now,
wait till homecoming.

16:42.880 --> 16:45.724
Hey, who are you bringing?
I don't want it to be weird.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.245
Sorry. Ugh.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.242
- Watch it, dick.
- Who are you?

16:50.440 --> 16:53.523
The guy who's been assigned
to protect a human blood bag.

16:54.320 --> 16:57.005
I mean, no offense or anything.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.647
What?

17:19.760 --> 17:21.922
No.

17:22.079 --> 17:23.319
Get it away.

17:24.160 --> 17:26.560
- You need blood.
- Get it away from me.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.321
Happy?

17:32.240 --> 17:33.321
Thank you.

17:35.040 --> 17:36.087
I remember you.

17:36.280 --> 17:40.842
Chicago, 1920s.
You were looking for Klaus.

17:44.160 --> 17:49.326
You're not so scary
for a bad-ass vampire vampire-hunter.

17:55.200 --> 17:58.682
- You gonna bench press a vampire?
- You understand what's happening?

17:58.840 --> 18:02.811
Stefan called me a human blood bag.
He's a completely different person.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.564
- What are you doing?
- Helping you out.

18:09.720 --> 18:10.846
- Damon.
- Come on, Buffy.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.081
Stop it.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.727
Like one obnoxious Salvatore
isn't bad enough.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.360
You called, I'm here.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.483
- What's your plan, oh warrior princess?
- I wanna lock Stefan up.

18:27.640 --> 18:31.326
At least until this Mikael guy comes,
kills Klaus and the compulsion breaks.

18:31.480 --> 18:34.689
Compulsion or not, Stefan's high
on human blood, okay? A lot of it.

18:34.880 --> 18:38.487
- We've gotten him off before.
- This is different. Not a stint in rehab.

18:38.640 --> 18:42.531
His humanity's gone.
Lights out. No one's home.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.404
Then do it for me, Damon.

18:46.240 --> 18:50.086
Every single time I look at him
I feel like I'm gonna break.

18:50.240 --> 18:52.720
And I'm not gonna give him
that satisfaction.

18:58.240 --> 18:59.730
What are you doing?

18:59.880 --> 19:01.450
Feel that?

19:01.720 --> 19:03.245
That's the sternum.

19:03.400 --> 19:05.528
It's a solid plate of bone.

19:06.440 --> 19:08.522
Right here, just below the rib cage.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.281
Next to the spine.

19:12.440 --> 19:14.408
That's your way to a vampire's heart.

19:16.920 --> 19:20.163
I'll do whatever it is you need me to do,
Elena.

19:22.560 --> 19:23.766
No one's gonna hurt you.

19:25.280 --> 19:27.760
Especially not my brother.

19:44.880 --> 19:47.804
I'll lure Stefan away from the fire.
When he's distracted...

19:47.960 --> 19:49.291
I'll shoot him.

19:49.440 --> 19:52.922
Can't Bonnie just Juju him?
- I'm trying to keep Bonnie out of this.

19:53.080 --> 19:55.162
I don't trust Stefan won't hurt her.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.560
Caroline, are you covered?

19:56.720 --> 20:02.011
Yes, I will make sure the old Forbes
jail cell is prepped and ready.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.811
You're forgetting a key player here.
Rebekah.

20:04.960 --> 20:07.645
Wherever Stefan goes,
a blond ponytail tends to follow.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.484
It's your job to keep her away.

20:09.680 --> 20:12.889
How? She's an Original.
Last time I checked, we're out of daggers.

20:13.040 --> 20:17.443
- So then preoccupy her with your charm.
- Might have better luck finding a dagger.

20:17.600 --> 20:20.206
- You ever not gonna be mad at me, Ric?
- Doubtful.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.289
Sorry I'm late. What's going on?

20:22.440 --> 20:24.727
We need you to raid
your mom's vervain supply.

20:24.880 --> 20:28.601
- Enough to keep Stefan down a while.
- You can't do that to Stefan.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.570
Why not?
Trust me, Tyler, it's in his best interest.

20:31.720 --> 20:33.529
- Yeah.
- But it's not in Klaus'.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.683
But Klaus is the bad guy, Tyler.

20:38.880 --> 20:42.771
Why are you acting like
some freaky hybrid slave-minion?

20:42.920 --> 20:43.921
Uh-oh.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.686
- What?
- Klaus made me who I am, Caroline.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.964
- I owe him everything.
- Oh, boy.

20:49.120 --> 20:51.521
Okay, can we cool it
on the commentary, please?

20:51.680 --> 20:53.967
What is going on?

20:54.320 --> 20:56.766
I'm just gonna go.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.968
What are you doing?

21:01.160 --> 21:02.969
- He's been sired.
- What?

21:03.160 --> 21:06.403
Sired. He feels loyal to Klaus
because Klaus' blood created him.

21:06.800 --> 21:08.689
Loyal how?

21:08.840 --> 21:13.323
He'll seek acceptance from his master.
It's rare. Maybe not so much in hybrids.

21:13.760 --> 21:15.091
So how do I fix him?

21:15.280 --> 21:16.361
Get a new boyfriend.

21:25.120 --> 21:26.690
You all right there?

21:26.840 --> 21:30.606
- I thought Tyler would be here.
- You're into Tyler now, huh? Fickle.

21:30.760 --> 21:32.922
You give me the time of day again,
we'll talk.

21:33.080 --> 21:35.287
Until then, a girl has needs.

21:35.480 --> 21:37.084
Excuse me.

21:37.640 --> 21:39.722
Elena, hi. What are you doing?

21:39.880 --> 21:42.724
I'm having fun, Stefan.
You have a problem with that?

21:44.040 --> 21:48.443
All right. Take it easy. We both know
you're kind of a lightweight.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.528
Really? You think I'm gonna let a
blood addict tell me how to drink?

22:11.800 --> 22:13.882
Concentrate on me, Matty.

22:18.800 --> 22:19.961
This is too weird.

22:20.160 --> 22:21.969
Just focus. This is a good thing.

22:29.240 --> 22:30.924
Now say you accept me.

22:32.760 --> 22:33.886
I accept you.

22:59.760 --> 23:00.966
Did you just...?

23:02.160 --> 23:03.400
I felt that.

23:05.160 --> 23:06.650
I feel that too.

23:07.280 --> 23:11.808
It worked. I'm here, Matty.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.690
You talked to Anna about this?

23:18.840 --> 23:21.844
She's on the other side.
I thought she might know something.

23:22.080 --> 23:23.923
About what? They're all alone there.

23:24.080 --> 23:28.324
Somehow Vicki's been communicating
with some super strong witch.

23:29.160 --> 23:32.846
If there's another witch, don't you think
you should come to me before Anna?

23:33.000 --> 23:35.128
Tell her not to be upset.
I tried to help.

23:35.320 --> 23:37.243
Not now, Anna.

23:37.800 --> 23:40.007
- She's here?
- She's just trying to help.

23:40.160 --> 23:42.640
- I can't deal with this right now.
- Bonnie...

23:42.840 --> 23:47.323
Matt's trying to resurrect his dead sister.
I think I'll go deal with that instead.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.603
I can feel this.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.604
I can feel everything.

23:56.200 --> 23:57.770
Witch didn't mention this part?

23:57.960 --> 24:01.328
It makes sense. Our deal was that
she'd help me do what I need to do.

24:02.560 --> 24:05.086
What are you talking about?
What deal, Vick?

24:05.280 --> 24:09.968
Well, if I want to stay here,
I have to help her restore the balance.

24:12.520 --> 24:14.841
Klaus' hybrids can't be allowed
to survive.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.447
- You can't kill Tyler, Vicki...
- Not Tyler, Matt.

24:18.640 --> 24:21.769
It's Elena who's the key
to creating the hybrids.

24:21.920 --> 24:23.729
What? Vicki, no...

24:28.080 --> 24:30.560
I'm sorry, Matty.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.688
But I want to stay.

24:46.480 --> 24:48.448
<i>Drink! Drink! Drink!</i>

25:27.680 --> 25:31.127
- What? No friends your own age?
- Like you can talk.

25:34.280 --> 25:36.726
Is this supposed to be fun?
I've been through 10.

25:36.880 --> 25:38.644
You're just looking at it all wrong.

25:38.880 --> 25:43.124
Look, it's a little rough on the
outside, but on the inside...

25:44.440 --> 25:46.090
Yum.

25:51.600 --> 25:52.647
Mm.

25:52.800 --> 25:55.007
- It's good.
- Yep.

26:09.080 --> 26:10.809
What's that look?

26:11.920 --> 26:13.445
What look?

26:14.160 --> 26:19.485
My brother's got his flirt on.
And you're jealous.

26:19.680 --> 26:20.761
I'm not jealous.

26:20.920 --> 26:24.481
It's all right, be jealous. By all means.
I'm sure Damon will be thrilled.

26:24.680 --> 26:27.570
I'm not jealous, Stefan.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.487
All right. It's my mistake.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.571
Whatever. I'm out of here.

26:40.800 --> 26:44.202
Matt. Matt, slow down.
What happened?

26:44.360 --> 26:45.691
I messed up, Bonnie.

26:46.200 --> 26:49.283
What? How? Where is she?

26:49.440 --> 26:52.649
Give me a hand
with this keg, man.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.207
I can't believe you've never
had one of these.

27:07.360 --> 27:09.727
Well, I've been in a casket
for 90 years.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.882
That's no excuse.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.327
- Mm.
- Mm.

27:17.200 --> 27:21.524
Why are you being so nice to me?
You hate me. You should be mean.

27:21.680 --> 27:25.401
Well, I could be mean
if that's what you're into.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.040
You're distracting me. Why?

27:28.240 --> 27:30.527
Just trying to be a good housemate.

27:34.040 --> 27:37.840
There's never a fair fight
between us, Damon.

27:38.040 --> 27:39.610
Remember that.

27:55.160 --> 27:59.290
What the hell? How did I get home?

27:59.520 --> 28:01.682
I brought you here.
You were being a d-bag.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.120
What's your problem today?

28:03.360 --> 28:08.082
My problem is you've been sired.
Do you even know what that means?

28:08.280 --> 28:11.966
It means that you put Klaus' needs first.
He is your master now.

28:12.400 --> 28:15.961
I'm not anyone's pet, Caroline.
He doesn't control me.

28:16.160 --> 28:20.370
Something's controlling you. Don't know
why else you're acting like the old you.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.768
- The old me?
- Yeah, the old you.

28:22.920 --> 28:27.209
The pre-werewolf you. The obnoxious
you that I would never be friends with.

28:27.440 --> 28:30.922
Whoa. Wait, wait, wait.

28:31.800 --> 28:36.681
I'm sorry. I don't want to be that guy.
I hated that guy.

28:37.600 --> 28:39.329
You're a vampire now, Tyler.

28:39.480 --> 28:44.281
Everything about your personality
is heightened. So you have to be careful.

28:49.240 --> 28:50.287
I will.

28:51.800 --> 28:57.204
I promise. Just don't hate me.

29:00.720 --> 29:05.009
Everything I like about me is you.

29:19.960 --> 29:25.364
I used to know every constellation.
How did I forget them all?

29:25.520 --> 29:28.251
You're drunk. You need to go home.

29:29.600 --> 29:33.207
Fine. Just let me find my car.

29:33.360 --> 29:35.442
- You're joking, right?
- Uh-oh.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.682
It's the fun-police.

29:37.840 --> 29:41.287
I thought that Ripper Stefan was
supposed to be the life of the party.

29:41.440 --> 29:44.205
All right, I'm driving you home.
Come on.

29:48.760 --> 29:50.683
What are you, 5? Get down.

29:50.840 --> 29:54.765
Why? Are you afraid
that I'm gonna...? Whoa.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.691
That was close.
Klaus would not be happy with you.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.530
You're hilarious.

30:00.520 --> 30:02.568
Look, Stefan. No hands.

30:13.080 --> 30:15.082
I knew you'd catch me.

30:36.920 --> 30:38.365
You okay?

30:38.560 --> 30:41.723
Yeah. I'm fine.

30:41.920 --> 30:46.289
- You look not sober.
- The plan worked. That's all that matters.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.442
Let's just get him out of here.

31:11.720 --> 31:15.327
I'm so sorry. I didn't think
she'd do something like this.

31:15.560 --> 31:17.005
I trusted her.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.885
You need to tell me
what you did to let Vicki out...

31:20.040 --> 31:22.281
so I know exactly
how to send her back.

31:27.640 --> 31:30.883
I see all the geniuses came out
to the bonfire tonight.

31:36.960 --> 31:39.088
Elena! Elena!

31:46.680 --> 31:49.490
- Open the door!
- I can't, it won't open.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.006
What the hell?

32:03.000 --> 32:04.126
I'm sorry, Elena.

32:13.720 --> 32:17.441
I found a spell that can block
whatever magic is helping Vicki.

32:18.120 --> 32:19.724
- What do I do?
- Give me your hand.

32:31.520 --> 32:34.729
Stefan.

32:38.400 --> 32:39.686
Elena.

32:55.120 --> 32:56.645
No!

33:03.120 --> 33:05.009
- What is she doing?
- Fixing my mistake.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.441
- Make her stop.
- Bonnie, hurry up.

33:07.640 --> 33:10.564
The spell is working, Matt.
She's still here because of you.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.442
Matt, please.

33:23.160 --> 33:24.969
I can't let you hurt anyone, Vicki.

33:25.120 --> 33:27.930
I won't. I'll stop.
Just please don't make me go.

33:29.680 --> 33:32.923
I have to. This is wrong.
You shouldn't be here.

33:34.080 --> 33:35.411
I'm sorry.

33:36.880 --> 33:39.770
I just didn't
want to be alone anymore.

33:40.320 --> 33:41.401
Neither did I.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.283
But I have to let you go.

33:52.120 --> 33:53.485
Goodbye, Vick.

34:03.320 --> 34:05.129
She's gone.

34:06.200 --> 34:09.248
- Hurry up before it blows.
- Wait, wait, wait.

34:35.080 --> 34:36.570
Give it to me. I can do it.

34:36.800 --> 34:38.882
- Damon, come on...
- Elena.

34:39.080 --> 34:41.844
You almost got barbecued.
Least I can do is first aid.

34:45.719 --> 34:46.846
There.

34:48.679 --> 34:51.159
You played your part of the plan
really well tonight.

34:51.320 --> 34:53.163
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, you had Rebekah...

34:53.360 --> 34:55.522
drooling over you
and your marshmallows.

34:55.679 --> 34:57.091
Yeah, before she skewered me.

34:59.360 --> 35:01.567
I thought you were too drunk to notice.

35:02.320 --> 35:03.685
I was faking most of it.

35:04.880 --> 35:05.927
So was I.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.888
You ready to get going, Elena?

35:13.920 --> 35:17.367
Great work tonight, Ric.
Sorry about the car, man. Bummer.

35:28.880 --> 35:31.963
- You're always running out.
- You have to earn the overnighter.

35:32.120 --> 35:34.566
- I consider that a challenge.
- Ha, ha.

35:42.400 --> 35:44.846
- Bye.
- Bye.

35:58.720 --> 36:00.882
- What are you doing here?
- I have something.

36:01.080 --> 36:03.003
- What?
- A little present.

36:18.440 --> 36:20.329
- You should go.
- You sure?

36:20.520 --> 36:22.602
I think my brother
would want his hybrid...

36:22.760 --> 36:25.889
to indulge in everything
life has to offer.

36:42.720 --> 36:45.200
I apologize for my outburst.

36:45.440 --> 36:49.650
It would have made more sense had you
known that I'd been denying myself...

36:49.800 --> 36:51.802
human blood
for as long I can remember.

36:54.160 --> 36:56.162
Why is it that you awoke me?

36:56.320 --> 36:59.449
I thought you might know
how to kill Klaus.

37:00.320 --> 37:04.120
But something tells me
that I've been sorely misinformed.

37:05.320 --> 37:07.721
Would you mind
helping me with these?

37:07.920 --> 37:10.810
I assure you there's no way I can
kill Klaus beneath them.

37:10.960 --> 37:15.363
- That mean you do know how?
- I can kill Klaus.

37:15.520 --> 37:16.567
And I will.

37:31.480 --> 37:32.686
Thank you.

37:32.840 --> 37:36.322
A little blood will grease those
muscles up real quick. Just saying.

37:37.520 --> 37:40.524
- I don't feed on living things.
- Then what do you eat?

37:52.200 --> 37:54.362
It's okay if you wanna
be friends with Damon.

37:54.520 --> 37:55.885
I don't.

37:56.080 --> 37:58.367
I think he kind of misses you.

38:03.520 --> 38:05.522
Well, you got me tonight.

38:06.760 --> 38:10.207
- I definitely wasn't expecting that.
- Well, that was the point.

38:10.360 --> 38:11.361
Yeah.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.367
You can hate it all you want,
but Elena needs me.

38:19.400 --> 38:21.402
I'll always protect her.

38:22.200 --> 38:25.044
I think you're both
better off having me around.

38:29.080 --> 38:30.445
Elena, wait.

38:32.240 --> 38:35.210
You could have let me die
in that fire tonight.

38:36.400 --> 38:39.404
- Why didn't you?
- Because I still have hope.

38:40.280 --> 38:42.203
After everything I've done...

38:44.000 --> 38:46.241
you think I'll find
my humanity again?

38:48.240 --> 38:50.208
Yes, I do.

38:50.400 --> 38:54.769
I know who you really are.
Better than anyone, Stefan.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.407
And I'm not giving up.

39:01.440 --> 39:06.731
Elena, do you have any idea
how pathetic that makes you?

39:08.640 --> 39:12.042
No, Stefan. It makes me strong.

39:30.120 --> 39:33.761
Bonnie, come on,
stop dodging my calls.

39:33.960 --> 39:37.123
Don't you think we should
at least talk about this?

39:40.320 --> 39:41.651
I shouldn't be here.

39:43.040 --> 39:45.122
No kidding.

39:45.800 --> 39:49.805
No, I mean,
I shouldn't be here, Jeremy.

39:49.960 --> 39:52.042
Why are you thinking about me?

39:52.280 --> 39:53.441
I didn't think I was.

39:54.680 --> 39:58.162
All right, look, I don't know. Okay?
I don't know what I'm doing, Anna.

40:00.320 --> 40:04.370
The problem is, I don't think
I can stop thinking about you.

40:10.640 --> 40:12.961
I can't stop thinking about you either.

40:17.680 --> 40:19.682
What are we gonna do?

40:36.400 --> 40:39.210
Do you feel this?

40:39.360 --> 40:40.646
What's going on?

40:41.200 --> 40:43.123
I can feel you.

40:43.680 --> 40:45.045
How can I feel you?

41:02.920 --> 41:04.046
Keep it up, Stefan.

41:20.880 --> 41:23.360
This is gonna be fun.

41:24.305 --> 41:30.309
