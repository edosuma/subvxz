00:04.260 --> 00:08.109
I really appreciate you getting up so early and driving me to work.

00:11.310 --> 00:13.490
I owe you one.

00:13.500 --> 00:17.020
You owed me one when I didn't smother you in your crib.

00:18.660 --> 00:21.320
Well, then, I owe you two.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.170
My car will be out of the shop in a couple of days.

00:24.190 --> 00:28.110
There was a terrible knock in the engine.
Like a...
like a...

00:28.880 --> 00:31.890
I kept saying, "Come in," but nobody did.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.240
Ooh, carpool lane-- that's us.
We could...

00:34.250 --> 00:36.080
- Shut up.
- Right.

00:38.890 --> 00:42.200
It's 7:00.
Where are all these damn people going?

00:42.210 --> 00:46.810
I know, right?
I deal with that every day.
Very frustrating.

00:46.820 --> 00:49.930
Sometimes I dream about buying a cabin in the woods and just getting away...

00:49.940 --> 00:51.960
- I said shut up.
- Yes, you did.

00:54.960 --> 00:58.420
The people going that way should just switch jobs with the people going this way, 

00:58.450 --> 01:01.790
and everybody can leave their freaking cars in the garage.

01:02.110 --> 01:05.940
You know, that's a...
that's a hell of an idea.
Right on.

01:06.550 --> 01:08.800
- Don't patronize me.
- Sorry.

01:12.500 --> 01:16.030
Wait a minute.
How are you getting back to Malibu?

01:16.860 --> 01:18.120
Uh, I...
I was, uh...

01:18.130 --> 01:19.210
- I was hoping...Charlie.
- No.

01:19.220 --> 01:20.060
Take the bus.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.870
There's no bus from Tarzana to Malibu.

01:21.890 --> 01:24.570
Then, take a series of buses.

01:24.580 --> 01:27.330
And don't get stuck on having to end up in Malibu.

01:27.340 --> 01:30.630
Charlie, come on.
It...
it's just for a couple of days.

01:30.640 --> 01:34.300
That's what Mom said when she brought you home from the hospital.

01:35.240 --> 01:37.490
Good one.

01:37.500 --> 01:40.290
You're a very funny man, Ollie.

01:40.300 --> 01:43.100
You certainly are.

01:44.420 --> 01:46.500
It's Laurel and Hardy.

01:46.510 --> 01:49.800
Boy, they used to...
they used to get in some wacky jams, huh?

01:51.260 --> 01:54.070
What about, uh...
uh, Abbott and Costello?

01:54.080 --> 01:57.150
"Hey, Abbott!" 

01:57.530 --> 01:59.560
Or, uh...
or, uh, Martin and Lewis?

01:59.570 --> 02:03.930
"Hey, lady, with the flavin' and the mavin' and the wow." 

02:07.270 --> 02:10.340
Three Stooges?
"Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck." 

02:12.870 --> 02:15.200
Whoa, what...
why are we stopping?

02:16.040 --> 02:17.820
Oh, a wise guy...

02:21.540 --> 02:26.450
Okay, I don't mind the good-natured brotherly punching, but you did not have to twist my nipples.

02:27.660 --> 02:30.450
You're lucky I didn't rip them off and feed them to you.

02:30.920 --> 02:32.160
Um, you know, if you...

02:32.170 --> 02:33.800
if you really have to go to the bathroom, there's, uh...

02:33.820 --> 02:35.100
there's one right down the hallway.

02:35.110 --> 02:36.390
What's wrong with the one in your office?

02:36.400 --> 02:38.030
Uh, it's not really for guests.

02:38.040 --> 02:40.010
Neither is my house.

02:40.300 --> 02:42.180
Um, you know, I think we're out of paper towels.

02:42.190 --> 02:45.660
I'll wipe my hands on you.
Get out of the way.

02:47.850 --> 02:49.950
Morning, Dr. Harper.

02:49.960 --> 02:52.340
Morning, Melissa.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.390
Hello, Melissa.

02:57.440 --> 03:00.180
You rat bastard.

03:26.260 --> 03:28.530
*******

03:28.590 --> 03:30.530
Good to know.

03:30.810 --> 03:33.120
Hi, I'm Charlie, Alan's brother.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.010
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

03:35.020 --> 03:36.790
Thought you had to tinkle.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.990
Go away.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.340
So, how long you been working for my baby brother?

03:42.350 --> 03:43.980
About six months.

03:43.990 --> 03:47.640
Wow, he's been keeping you a secret for six months?

03:49.600 --> 03:51.480
Charlie, can I talk to you for a minute?

03:51.490 --> 03:54.550
There's no reason to thank me for the ride again, Alan.

03:54.570 --> 03:57.620
Mi Mercedes, su Mercedes.

03:59.130 --> 04:03.240
It's what brothers do when one is vastly more fortunate than the other.

04:04.940 --> 04:08.140
Seriously, we need to talk.

04:08.450 --> 04:11.140
Excuse us.

04:12.700 --> 04:15.120
Charlie, she is the best receptionist I have ever had.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.570
I'm hoping to say the same.

04:17.579 --> 04:19.890
Come on, Charlie, please do not crap where I work.

04:19.910 --> 04:22.570
Hey, you crap where I live.

04:22.970 --> 04:24.220
So tell me about her.

04:24.260 --> 04:26.890
There's nothing to tell.
She's a...
she's a terrific employee.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.720
She does my scheduling, my books.
My patients love her.

04:29.730 --> 04:31.760
She keeps the whole operation running like clockwork, 

04:31.780 --> 04:35.970
and she does it all for crappy pay and no benefits.

04:36.950 --> 04:38.920
So you're not hitting that?

04:38.940 --> 04:40.290
No, I'm not hitting that.

04:40.310 --> 04:43.740
And even if I were hitting that, I wouldn't use the phrase, "hitting that." 

04:43.770 --> 04:46.060
It's a violent image for a beautiful act.

04:46.070 --> 04:47.880
Yeah, yeah...
so the coast is clear?

04:47.890 --> 04:49.390
No, the coast is not clear.

04:49.410 --> 04:53.220
The coast is foggy and strewn with dangerously pointy rocks.

04:53.890 --> 04:56.140
Can I get either of you a cup of coffee?

04:56.160 --> 04:57.990
- Sure.
- No.

04:58.390 --> 05:00.710
No for both of us.
Please leave.

05:01.070 --> 05:02.570
All right.

05:02.590 --> 05:04.500
- Bye, Melissa.
- Bye, Charlie.

05:04.510 --> 05:06.350
Hope I see you again.

05:06.360 --> 05:09.230
Oh, you'll see me tonight when I come back to pick up your boss.

05:10.530 --> 05:14.140
Oh, oh, no, Charlie, Charlie, you don't have to make that long drive.
I'll take the bus.

05:14.150 --> 05:15.280
I thought there were no buses.

05:15.300 --> 05:17.900
If I have to, I'll charter one.

05:18.680 --> 05:21.270
Why don't I just give you a ride home?

05:21.300 --> 05:23.990
Oh, that is so sweet of you.

05:24.020 --> 05:26.820
You got a real gem here, Alan.

05:26.850 --> 05:32.560
Tell you what, when you get him home, there will be a cold margarita waiting for you out on my deck.

05:33.260 --> 05:38.440
Which overlooks the ocean.
On the beach.
In Malibu.

05:40.010 --> 05:41.140
That sounds wonderful.

05:41.170 --> 05:44.370
It's really not: it's chilly, damp, and covered with pelican poop.

05:46.070 --> 05:50.240
That's why he'll never win the Malibu slogan contest.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.320
See you tonight, Melissa.

05:52.350 --> 05:53.630
Bye, Charlie.

05:53.650 --> 05:55.030
Have a great day, bro.

05:55.040 --> 05:57.300
- I hate you.
- I hate you, too.

05:59.100 --> 06:00.960
Gee, your brother is really cute.

06:00.980 --> 06:03.230
As a bug.

06:04.730 --> 06:05.620
Bathroom?

06:05.640 --> 06:07.780
Oh, let me give you the key.

06:12.250 --> 06:13.430
Thank you.

06:13.450 --> 06:15.900
You're very welcome.

06:16.170 --> 06:18.670
You are a doll.

06:18.680 --> 06:21.500
You are cute.

06:26.310 --> 06:28.610
She's actually a doll.

06:31.340 --> 06:34.350
I wonder if she's anatomically correct.

06:36.000 --> 06:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here

06:45.540 --> 06:47.690
Who's the Smurf?

06:49.910 --> 06:52.750
The Smurf is my receptionist.

06:52.780 --> 06:55.160
You're letting Charlie hit that?

06:55.990 --> 06:58.390
Okay, look, first of all, that is a very ugly phrase.

06:58.420 --> 07:00.100
And second of all, I'm not letting him.

07:00.130 --> 07:03.450
I mean, short of drugging him and dumping him in the woods, what can I do?

07:03.470 --> 07:07.550
Yeah.
He is like an Alabama bloodhound once he gets a whiff.

07:10.650 --> 07:14.310
Now it's just a matter of waiting until it blows up in my face.

07:14.330 --> 07:18.760
And after it blows up in my face, it will then circle around and bite me in the ass.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.710
That's me.
No face, no ass.

07:23.330 --> 07:26.330
Well, that's what you get when you mix work and personal.

07:26.340 --> 07:30.850
Which is why me and Charlie have always kept everything strictly professional.

07:32.890 --> 07:35.910
Yeah, yeah, I've often wondered about that.

07:35.920 --> 07:40.630
When I first started to work here, I laid down the law: looky, no touchy.

07:45.460 --> 07:47.460
Yipes.

07:48.990 --> 07:53.000
All right, I'll make you another, but you got to promise not to chug this one.

07:53.030 --> 07:55.400
Promise!

07:56.770 --> 07:59.280
What a fun gal.

07:59.290 --> 08:02.320
Charlie, do you know how hard it is to find a decent receptionist?

08:02.340 --> 08:05.170
Well, kudos, bro, you did a great job.

08:05.890 --> 08:08.470
Thank you, and I-I really don't want to lose her.

08:08.490 --> 08:09.830
Why would you lose her?

08:09.840 --> 08:10.880
Oh, gee, I don't know.

08:10.900 --> 08:15.260
Maybe because my brother intends to defile and discard her like a warm melon.

08:15.740 --> 08:18.100
A warm melon?

08:18.110 --> 08:19.810
Nothing.

08:19.820 --> 08:23.300
Anyway, my point is that you're gonna leave her with bad memories 

08:23.330 --> 08:27.260
that can only be erased by removing herself from anything that reminds her of you-- 

08:27.290 --> 08:28.620
like me.

08:28.640 --> 08:31.340
Is that what you're worried about, Bunky?

08:31.350 --> 08:32.780
Yes, that's what I'm worried about.

08:32.799 --> 08:33.990
What did you think I was worried about?

08:34.000 --> 08:36.190
What else would I be worried about?

08:36.200 --> 08:37.440
Well, let's see.

08:37.460 --> 08:41.840
Your receding hairline, your semi-literate son, your budding man-boobs.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.240
But that's just off the top of my head.

08:44.270 --> 08:45.940
Charlie, please, I am begging you.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.550
Look, I understand your concerns, but it's not like that.

08:48.560 --> 08:50.490
I think Melissa is terrific.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.050
You always think they're terrific.

08:52.080 --> 08:54.060
They're terrific before.
They're terrific during.

08:54.070 --> 08:56.930
It's the after when the crying and the quitting start.

08:56.950 --> 08:58.660
Why is it always about you?

08:58.670 --> 09:01.910
Aren't I entitled to some happiness?

09:01.920 --> 09:04.180
You've had your share of happiness.

09:04.200 --> 09:08.010
You've had your share of happiness, my share, everybody's share.

09:08.020 --> 09:12.290
You've sucked the marrow of happiness from the...
bones of...

09:13.040 --> 09:15.440
Oh, just leave her alone, won't you?

09:17.150 --> 09:19.460
Alan, you don't have to worry.

09:19.480 --> 09:23.960
You're thinking about the old Charlie, the old-hump-'em- and-dump-'em, one-track-mind Charlie.

09:23.990 --> 09:28.480
Oh, oh, right, uh, the old Charlie from way back this morning.

09:28.490 --> 09:31.510
I'm serious.
I honestly want to start building a relationship.

09:31.520 --> 09:33.050
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:33.060 --> 09:37.510
Get to know someone, let her get to know me, have something in common before we jump into bed.

09:37.530 --> 09:39.260
Wow, I'm impressed.

09:39.280 --> 09:40.270
That I'm growing up?

09:40.290 --> 09:43.270
No, that you can so easily lie to my face.

09:44.450 --> 09:45.790
You'll see.

09:45.810 --> 09:47.710
It's gonna be different with Melissa.

09:47.730 --> 09:51.360
I'm gonna take my time, form a friendship, bond emotionally, 

09:51.400 --> 09:54.320
and then and only then, take it to the next level.

09:54.330 --> 09:57.330
98 minutes later...

09:57.340 --> 09:59.740
Oh, Charlie!

10:03.590 --> 10:06.120
You schmuck.

10:12.140 --> 10:14.440
Morning, Dr. Harper.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.460
Morning.

10:18.470 --> 10:21.350
I like your jammies.

10:21.360 --> 10:25.110
Thank you, I, uh, I like your...
thank you.

10:27.350 --> 10:29.420
Guess you're kind of surprised to see me, huh?

10:29.430 --> 10:31.570
Yeah, shocked.

10:31.580 --> 10:35.820
Well, I hope you know it is not the kind of thing I usually do-- 

10:35.850 --> 10:39.540
you know, hop into bed with a fella zippity-quick.

10:39.550 --> 10:41.250
It's really none of my business.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.150
Well, I don't.

10:43.180 --> 10:45.970
But Charlie is so sweet and special.

10:46.010 --> 10:48.600
Yep, he's a treasure.

10:50.290 --> 10:52.780
Yeah, and this works out well for you.

10:52.790 --> 10:54.430
Really?
Uh, how do you figure?

10:54.690 --> 10:59.150
Since your car is still in the shop, we can carpool to and from work.

11:00.030 --> 11:02.480
I see.
So, so you'll be coming back?

11:02.490 --> 11:03.970
Oh, yeah.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.800
Charlie asked me to stay the weekend.

11:07.460 --> 11:09.570
- No kidding.
- Yeppers.

11:09.580 --> 11:11.810
We really made a connection...

11:12.190 --> 11:14.500
and it is not just physical.

11:14.510 --> 11:17.330
Although the physical part is amazing.

11:18.870 --> 11:21.070
Again, none of my business.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.760
It is like I have known him all my life.

11:23.780 --> 11:26.280
I know the feeling.
You get over it.

11:27.470 --> 11:28.880
Hey, baby.

11:28.890 --> 11:30.890
Hey yourself.

11:33.740 --> 11:35.830
- Do I smell toast?
- You do.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.590
Would you like a slice?

11:37.600 --> 11:39.150
I can put butter and jelly on it.

11:39.170 --> 11:41.080
Oh, d\j vu.

11:41.090 --> 11:43.340
Stop it.
You're terrible.

11:47.260 --> 11:49.620
Sorry, Dr. Harper.

11:49.630 --> 11:52.540
That's okay.
I wasn't even listening.

11:53.930 --> 11:55.280
I'm going to take a shower.

11:55.310 --> 11:57.880
Hit the road in about 20 minutes?

11:57.890 --> 12:00.160
- I thought you were going to call in sick.
- Shush.

12:00.170 --> 12:02.200
He's kidding.

12:02.210 --> 12:04.020
It's okay.
20 minutes is fine.

12:04.030 --> 12:05.720
Great.

12:08.180 --> 12:11.330
Alan, you know me as a cynical man, 

12:11.350 --> 12:17.560
but in just one night that little pixie has melted this cold, lonely heart.

12:28.570 --> 12:30.770
You don't say.

12:30.780 --> 12:33.820
You may not believe me, but there is something going on here, 

12:33.840 --> 12:36.690
and I really want to thank you for bringing her into my life.

12:36.710 --> 12:39.230
I may not believe you?

12:39.260 --> 12:41.910
You know what?
Fine.
Think what you want.

12:41.920 --> 12:47.580
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go play Paul Bunyan takes a shower in Tiny Town.

12:52.890 --> 12:54.840
Sorry we're running late.

12:54.850 --> 12:56.810
That's all right.

12:56.840 --> 13:00.170
Shower lasted a bit longer than I planned.

13:02.660 --> 13:05.560
Yeah, well, uh, that happens.

13:06.310 --> 13:10.160
I got to tell you, I am just crazy about your brother.

13:10.170 --> 13:13.120
Swell.
Hope it works out.

13:14.420 --> 13:17.310
How is a guy like that still single?

13:19.420 --> 13:22.820
Well, he's always been a bit of a butterfly, 

13:22.840 --> 13:26.990
you know, fluttering through life, hard to pin down.

13:27.220 --> 13:30.560
And being a fall-down drunk is kind of a speed bump for some of the ladies.

13:30.570 --> 13:34.100
You're such a jokester, Dr. Harper.

13:34.600 --> 13:37.750
Either that or put a gun in my mouth.

13:38.280 --> 13:40.050
Oh, listen, on the way home tonight, 

13:40.060 --> 13:43.540
we have to swing by my apartment so I can get some clothes for the weekend.

13:43.750 --> 13:46.490
And I'm gonna need a little extra time for lunch today.

13:46.500 --> 13:49.260
I want to buy some sexy lingerie...

13:49.270 --> 13:51.440
for you know.

13:52.230 --> 13:54.240
I do.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.340
Can I pick you up anything?

13:56.360 --> 14:02.080
Yeah, yeah, um, ear plugs would be nice, um, and that gun I mentioned.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.080
Nothing special.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.890
I'm only going to use it just the once.

14:16.040 --> 14:19.000
- Hi, Jake.
- Hey, got to hit the crapper.

14:21.070 --> 14:22.710
You must be Judith.

14:22.740 --> 14:24.200
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

14:24.210 --> 14:27.050
I'm Melissa, Dr. Harper's receptionist.

14:27.070 --> 14:28.710
We talk on the phone all the time.

14:28.720 --> 14:32.700
Oh, right, Melissa.
It's so nice to finally meet you.
Alan!

14:33.260 --> 14:37.150
Oh, oh, hey, hey, hi, uh, hi, Judith, this is Melissa.
Melissa, Judith.

14:37.160 --> 14:39.690
It's not what it looks like.
Charlie's doing her, not me.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.800
And, uh, where is Charlie anyway?

14:43.820 --> 14:45.140
Taking a nap.

14:45.150 --> 14:47.440
He says I drain him.

14:47.950 --> 14:50.620
Isn't that adorable?

14:51.260 --> 14:53.760
Adorable, disturbing, whatever.

14:53.770 --> 14:56.220
Uh, thanks, I've got this.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.620
- Your brother and your receptionist?
- What do you want from me?

14:59.630 --> 15:03.170
Th-The Volvo's in the shop, he twisted my nipples and peed in my office.

15:03.180 --> 15:04.200
What?

15:04.210 --> 15:06.090
I'm not thrilled about this either, but what can I do?

15:06.100 --> 15:09.480
You could think about the effect these shenanigans have on your adolescent son.

15:09.490 --> 15:11.840
Okay, you know what, Judith?
I have enough problems.

15:11.850 --> 15:15.760
If you're not comfortable leaving Jake here for the weekend, then take him home.

15:16.110 --> 15:18.390
Nice try, Alan.

15:25.460 --> 15:28.760
You think Uncle Charlie and Melissa are coming down for lunch?

15:28.770 --> 15:31.000
I doubt it.

15:32.020 --> 15:33.470
Can I have their chicken?

15:33.480 --> 15:35.460
Knock yourself out.

15:39.950 --> 15:42.450
You know how you always say I can ask you anything?

15:42.460 --> 15:43.420
Yeah?

15:43.430 --> 15:45.010
Is them being together weird for you?

15:45.020 --> 15:46.260
No, no.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.670
Well, you're a better man than I.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.200
How so?

15:53.230 --> 15:55.460
Well, you remember when Uncle Charlie was hittin' my fifth grade teacher?

15:55.470 --> 15:57.330
Okay...

15:57.530 --> 16:00.030
can we please stop calling it "hittin'"?

16:00.040 --> 16:03.270
Well, I got another word, but I don't think you're going to like it.

16:07.230 --> 16:10.560
Fine, fine, then I, uh, I do remember when he was...

16:10.570 --> 16:13.170
hitting your fifth grade teacher.

16:13.180 --> 16:14.950
That kind of bugged me.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.300
Well, I'm, I'm sorry.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.150
I mean, don't you think there should be boundaries?

16:18.160 --> 16:19.790
I do think that.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.780
But I thought you said it's not weird that he's hittin' your receptionist.

16:22.800 --> 16:28.240
Ah, uh, w...
uh, well, pal, um, the thing is, um, Daddy lied.

16:29.880 --> 16:30.840
Oh, then it is weird for you?

16:30.870 --> 16:32.680
Yes, yes, it is weird for me.

16:32.690 --> 16:33.610
Are you jealous?

16:33.620 --> 16:34.930
Uh, no, no.

16:34.960 --> 16:38.080
'Cause I was a little bit jealous about Miss Pasternak.

16:38.450 --> 16:41.190
She had a rockin' bod.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.950
Eat your chicken.

16:48.790 --> 16:52.050
Melissa?
We, uh, need to get a move on.

16:52.060 --> 16:54.190
A lot of traffic what with the rain and all.

16:54.230 --> 16:57.120
- We need a minute, Alan.
- Oh, God.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.110
What can they do in a minute that they didn't do all weekend?

17:01.850 --> 17:06.490
You are just a selfish son of a bitch and you can go right to hell!

17:08.150 --> 17:11.720
Sorry, Dr. Harper.
I'll be in the car.

17:16.380 --> 17:19.470
Well...
that could have gone better.

17:19.480 --> 17:20.700
I knew it.

17:20.710 --> 17:23.430
I thought it might take longer than 48 hours, but I knew it.

17:24.740 --> 17:27.950
A little sensitivity would be appreciated.
I'm hurting here.

17:27.960 --> 17:30.680
I'm sure a lot of that is friction burn.

17:32.940 --> 17:34.320
Where does that come from?

17:34.350 --> 17:36.110
Where does it come from?

17:36.130 --> 17:40.170
It comes from a long history of you using my life as a specimen cup.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.550
Excuse me, but you're still talking about the old Charlie.

17:44.590 --> 17:48.260
This Charlie was hoping to have a relationship of substance and depth.

17:48.280 --> 17:53.380
By locking a stranger in your room and hittin' it for two days straight?

17:54.320 --> 17:57.160
Okay, mea culpa.

17:57.940 --> 18:00.370
Change is hard.

18:00.710 --> 18:03.490
And now that I'm hearing it, I agree with you.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.200
Hittin' it is an ugly term.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.670
Don't change the subject.
What happened?

18:07.680 --> 18:09.150
Nothing.

18:12.100 --> 18:15.820
I just said to her that maybe we should slow things down, see other people.

18:15.840 --> 18:18.830
Wait, y-y-you said this after the two days?

18:18.840 --> 18:21.900
How could I know beforehand?

18:21.910 --> 18:23.910
I thought you'd be happy.

18:23.940 --> 18:25.890
You didn't want me to go out with her in the first place.

18:25.910 --> 18:28.940
Yes, but it's no longer the first place.
It's the last place.

18:29.650 --> 18:31.010
What can I tell you, Alan?

18:31.030 --> 18:32.620
I made a mistake.

18:32.660 --> 18:34.930
I rushed to love.

18:35.310 --> 18:39.330
No, no, your mistake was you rushed to love my receptionist, 

18:39.350 --> 18:41.570
the woman who I depend upon to run my business.

18:41.580 --> 18:43.280
Oh, she's a good kid.

18:43.300 --> 18:45.470
She'll get over it.

18:46.760 --> 18:50.040
You hear that?
You hear that?
Does that sound like a woman who's getting over it?

18:50.050 --> 18:52.820
Well, Alan, the wounds are fresh.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.500
You're going to need to be patient.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.460
Why should I have to be patient?

18:56.470 --> 18:59.190
Well, you have to work with her.

19:01.230 --> 19:03.850
And it sounds like you'd better get going.

19:03.880 --> 19:07.710
Sure you don't want to come back to my office and hump my fax machine?

19:09.090 --> 19:11.940
You still have a fax machine?

19:11.950 --> 19:13.830
You're despicable.

19:14.300 --> 19:16.200
- Alan, wait.
- What?

19:16.210 --> 19:17.440
Let me make it up to you.

19:17.450 --> 19:19.680
How could you possibly make it up to me?

19:19.700 --> 19:23.440
Well, I'm guessing she won't be inclined to bring you back here tonight.

19:23.460 --> 19:27.430
So why don't you take a cab and I'll pay for it?

19:27.510 --> 19:30.850
Thanks.
That makes up for everything.

19:31.640 --> 19:34.620
I'm talking cab, not Town Car.

19:36.680 --> 19:39.060
Oh, man.

19:39.070 --> 19:41.900
Break-ups are so hard.

19:47.700 --> 19:50.510
I do have a little friction burn.

19:56.880 --> 19:59.030
That miserable son of a bitch.

19:59.040 --> 20:02.520
Might want to extend your brake zone on the wet roads.

20:02.530 --> 20:04.970
- I'm so stupid.
- No, no, no, no, you are not stupid.

20:04.980 --> 20:07.120
You're, you're a dear, sweet, remarkably bright...

20:07.130 --> 20:09.970
Truck, truck-- watch out for the truck.
Watch out for the truck.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.350
- I want a raise.
- Sure, sure.

20:18.360 --> 20:19.940
- And health insurance.
- That's a given.

20:19.950 --> 20:21.380
I-I can't believe you don't have it already.

20:21.390 --> 20:22.370
