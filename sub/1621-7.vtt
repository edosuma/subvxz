WEBVTT

02:10.422 --> 02:11.672
A cripple?

02:13.175 --> 02:14.509
You let a cripple escape?

02:16.094 --> 02:19.555
The boy can't walk,
but somehow he slipped past you?

02:20.432 --> 02:22.183
The giant must have took him.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.062
The giant?

02:27.064 --> 02:28.147
Hodor?

02:30.067 --> 02:31.943
Oh, that's all right, then.

02:32.027 --> 02:34.737
You let a halfwit escape with a cripple.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.281
And Rickon, too? The little one?

02:37.366 --> 02:39.867
Gone, along with the wildling woman.

02:41.078 --> 02:42.995
The one you were fucking.

03:02.432 --> 03:03.599
Right.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.977
Get the horses and the hounds.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.858
Come on, find the scent.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.488
Where they going?

03:27.791 --> 03:28.875
Halt!

03:33.797 --> 03:35.172
Enjoying your first hunt?

03:35.257 --> 03:38.384
So far, hunting seems
very similar to riding, my lord.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.344
With hunting, there's blood at the end.

03:40.429 --> 03:41.596
They're little boys.

03:41.680 --> 03:45.349
I was a little boy when I was torn away
from my home and brought here.

03:45.434 --> 03:48.644
So I kept my word. I never ran away.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.814
If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.985
Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them.

03:56.612 --> 03:59.530
Those boys are of far more value
to you alive than dead.

03:59.615 --> 04:01.032
They have no value to me missing.

04:01.116 --> 04:03.451
Robb will have sent a force
to retake Winterfell by now.

04:03.535 --> 04:06.871
Robb's in the Riverlands.
My sister's in Deepwood Motte.

04:06.955 --> 04:09.498
She'll get here long before they do.

04:10.042 --> 04:14.378
And Ned Stark always said
500 men could hold Winterfell against 10,000.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.880
We have a scent!

04:16.964 --> 04:18.089
The hounds have the scent.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.928
Come, Maester, don't look so grim.

04:23.055 --> 04:24.513
It's all just a game.

04:40.864 --> 04:41.989
We should have took more food.

04:42.366 --> 04:44.158
We couldn't risk going to the kitchens.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.869
Those people all love you. They would have
given you whatever you needed.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.246
And if Theon found out, he'd hang them.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.707
- The boy can't survive on walnuts.
- I'm fine.

04:53.752 --> 04:56.212
We've been walking since before sunrise.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.506
- Even Hodor will tire.
- Hodor.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.050
- Even you, sweet giant.
- Hodor.

05:05.389 --> 05:07.348
Wait, I know that farm.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.059
I sent those two Winterfell orphans there.

05:11.061 --> 05:12.144
Jack and Billy.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.981
- They'll give us some food.
- We can't risk it.

05:15.065 --> 05:18.859
If Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them
until he finds out where we are.

05:18.944 --> 05:21.320
Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.

05:21.405 --> 05:23.072
You've never seen me climb a tree, little man.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.825
They'll be after us with hounds.

05:25.909 --> 05:29.328
We got a good start on them,
but we can't outrun hounds forever.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.440
Did you pull a knife on me in the night?

06:08.118 --> 06:09.785
What's the matter?

06:09.870 --> 06:12.747
Can't be the first time you pressed your bone
against a woman's arse.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.667
Let's move.

06:23.467 --> 06:24.884
It is the first time.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.220
How old are you, boy?

06:28.680 --> 06:30.806
I'm a man of the Night's Watch.

06:33.101 --> 06:35.519
You're a boy who's never been with a girl.

06:39.483 --> 06:43.152
Don't your stones start to hurt
if your bone never gets...

06:44.071 --> 06:45.529
Don't call them that.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.531
What, stones?

06:49.409 --> 06:50.659
Or bone?

06:51.161 --> 06:52.369
Neither.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.663
Both.

06:57.667 --> 06:58.793
Move!

07:04.508 --> 07:08.427
I heard they get all swollen and bruised
if you don't use them.

07:08.678 --> 07:13.015
Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say
when they want me feeling sorry for them.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.059
As if I'd feel sorry for them.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.521
Are there no girl crows?

07:20.357 --> 07:22.942
There are no women of the Night's Watch, no.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.735
So the lads just do it with each other?

07:24.861 --> 07:25.903
No.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.364
- Never?
- Never.

07:29.407 --> 07:31.033
We swore an oath.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.869
You have sheep at the Wall?

07:36.456 --> 07:38.332
With your hands, then?

07:38.542 --> 07:41.001
No wonder you're all so miserable.

07:42.087 --> 07:44.880
- Would you please shut up?
- Would you please shut up?

07:46.299 --> 07:48.926
You think you're better than me, crow.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.303
- I'm a free woman.
- You're a free woman?

07:51.388 --> 07:53.556
I might be your prisoner,
but I'm a free woman.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.143
If you're my prisoner, you're not
a free woman. That's what "prisoner" means.

07:57.686 --> 07:59.145
And you think you're free?

08:00.522 --> 08:03.858
You swore some stupid oath
and now you can never touch a girl.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.152
It was my choice to say the words.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.237
- So you don't like girls?
- Of course I like girls.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.905
But you chose never to touch them.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.867
That's the price you pay
if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.

08:12.951 --> 08:16.328
So instead of getting naked with a girl,
you'd prefer to invade our lands...

08:16.413 --> 08:18.038
lnvade your lands?

08:18.456 --> 08:20.291
Wildlings raid our lands all the time.

08:20.375 --> 08:23.002
Some of them tried to kill my little brother,
a crippled boy!

08:23.086 --> 08:24.962
They're not your lands!

08:25.088 --> 08:27.173
We've been here the whole time.

08:27.257 --> 08:30.593
You lot came along and just put up a big wall
and said it was yours.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.970
My father was Ned Stark.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.347
I have the blood of the First Men.

08:35.432 --> 08:38.100
My ancestors lived here, same as yours.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.770
So why are you fighting us?

08:59.289 --> 09:00.456
Go on.

09:06.838 --> 09:08.797
Now I want you to tell me
what happened.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.549
Come on, this way.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.638
Come on, speak up. Speak up.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.186
Wolfsbane.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.314
A rare substance.

09:26.441 --> 09:28.525
This is no common assassin.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.861
We hanged 20 men last night.

09:30.946 --> 09:33.239
I don't care if you hanged 100.

09:33.990 --> 09:37.284
A man tried to kill me.
I want his name and I want his head.

09:37.369 --> 09:41.205
We think it was an infiltrator from
the Brotherhood Without Banners.

09:41.831 --> 09:44.416
Pretentious name for a band of outlaws.

09:45.377 --> 09:49.171
We can't allow rebels behind our lines
to harass us with impunity.

09:49.256 --> 09:53.050
We look like fools and they look like heroes.
That's how kings fall.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.219
I want them dead, every one.

09:55.387 --> 09:57.012
Killing them isn't the problem.

09:57.806 --> 09:58.973
It's finding them.

09:59.182 --> 10:00.349
Have you gone soft, Clegane?

10:01.559 --> 10:03.435
I always thought you had a talent for violence.

10:03.895 --> 10:06.230
Burn the villages, burn the farms.

10:07.023 --> 10:09.441
Let them know what it means
to choose the wrong side.

10:09.526 --> 10:10.526
Mmm.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.572
Is that mutton?

10:15.907 --> 10:17.324
Yes, my lord.

10:17.409 --> 10:18.575
Don't like mutton.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.746
- I'll bring something else.
- Leave it.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.626
- Are you hungry?
- No.

10:27.711 --> 10:29.378
Of course you are.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.130
Eat.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.882
I'll eat in the kitchen later.

10:34.551 --> 10:37.386
It's bad manners to refuse a lord's offer.

10:38.430 --> 10:39.513
Sit.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.683
Eat.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.229
You're small for your age.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.608
I suppose you've been underfed
your whole life.

10:51.693 --> 10:52.860
I eat a lot.

10:53.445 --> 10:54.903
I just don't grow.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.071
Mmm.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.660
This will be my last war.

11:03.455 --> 11:04.872
Win or lose.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.625
Have you ever lost before?

11:09.252 --> 11:12.504
Do you think I'd be in my position
if I had lost a war?

11:18.845 --> 11:20.637
But this is the one I'll be remembered for.

11:22.557 --> 11:24.600
The War of Five Kings, they're calling it.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.313
My legacy will be determined
in the coming months.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.650
Do you know what legacy means?

11:36.112 --> 11:40.407
It's what you pass down to your children
and your children's children.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.787
It's what remains of you when you're gone.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.627
Harren the Black thought
this castle would be his legacy.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.298
The greatest fortress ever built.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.134
The tallest towers, the strongest walls.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.346
The Great Hall had 35 hearths.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.474
Thirty-five. Can you imagine?

12:06.935 --> 12:07.976
Look at it now.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.938
A blasted ruin.

12:12.941 --> 12:14.316
Do you know what happened?

12:14.818 --> 12:16.026
Dragons?

12:16.653 --> 12:17.653
Yes.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.155
Dragons happened.

12:23.493 --> 12:27.496
Harrenhal was built to withstand
an attack from the land.

12:30.834 --> 12:33.210
A million men could have
marched on these walls,

12:33.294 --> 12:35.504
and a million men would have been repelled.

12:35.839 --> 12:40.175
But an attack from the air with dragon fire...
Mmm-mmm.

12:41.302 --> 12:44.388
Harren and all his sons
roasted alive within these walls.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.975
Aegon Targaryen changed the rules.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.563
That's why every child alive
still knows his name

12:52.647 --> 12:54.481
300 years after his death.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.733
Aegon and his sisters.

12:58.653 --> 12:59.653
Mmm?

12:59.863 --> 13:02.573
It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.700
It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too.

13:05.368 --> 13:06.535
Correct.

13:07.370 --> 13:09.204
A student of history, are you?

13:09.706 --> 13:11.331
Rhaenys rode Meraxes.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.417
Visenya rode Vhagar.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.838
I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.883
Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior.

13:22.427 --> 13:25.179
She had a Valyrian steel sword
she called Dark Sister.

13:26.431 --> 13:27.431
Hmm.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.558
She's a heroine of yours, I take it?

13:31.227 --> 13:34.521
Aren't most girls more interested
in the pretty maidens from the songs?

13:34.606 --> 13:36.815
Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?

13:36.900 --> 13:38.775
Most girls are idiots.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.946
You remind me of my daughter.

13:44.532 --> 13:49.244
Where did you learn all this stuff about
Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?

13:51.164 --> 13:52.414
From my father.

13:54.959 --> 13:57.085
He was a well-read stonemason.

13:58.755 --> 14:01.757
Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.093
Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?

14:08.014 --> 14:09.181
Careful now, girl.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.934
I enjoy you, but be careful.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.520
Take that back to the kitchen.

14:15.313 --> 14:16.480
Eat what you want.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.443
And, girl.

14:23.780 --> 14:24.988
"M'lord."

14:27.575 --> 14:29.618
Lowborn girls say "m'lord,"

14:30.286 --> 14:31.787
not "my lord."

14:32.747 --> 14:35.582
if you're going to pose as a commoner,
you should do it properly.

14:38.169 --> 14:41.713
My mother served Lady Dustin
for many years, my lord.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.384
She taught me how to speak proper...
Properly.

14:48.012 --> 14:51.348
You're too smart for your own good.
Has anyone told you that?

14:51.808 --> 14:52.808
Yes.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.185
Go on.

15:06.990 --> 15:08.657
I beg pardon, ser.

15:10.785 --> 15:14.496
I should have come to you after
to thank you for saving me.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.124
- You were so brave.
- Brave?

15:18.209 --> 15:20.711
A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats.

15:21.379 --> 15:23.547
Does it give you joy to scare people?

15:24.382 --> 15:26.550
No, it gives me joy to kill people.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.011
Spare me. You can't tell me

15:29.095 --> 15:32.014
Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell
never killed a man.

15:32.307 --> 15:34.891
It was his duty. He never liked it.

15:35.518 --> 15:37.603
Is that what he told you?

15:37.687 --> 15:38.854
He lied.

15:39.981 --> 15:41.732
Killing is the sweetest thing there is.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.277
Why are you always so hateful?

15:45.361 --> 15:48.989
You'll be glad of the hateful things I do
someday when you're queen

15:49.073 --> 15:52.326
and I'm all that stands between you
and your beloved king.

16:02.003 --> 16:05.380
I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen.
One of them did this or knows who did.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.090
You are one of the Thirteen.

16:07.175 --> 16:09.259
If I wanted your dragons,
I would have taken them.

16:09.344 --> 16:12.429
- They mean nothing to me on their own.
- Nothing?

16:13.056 --> 16:15.098
They're more valuable
than anything in the world.

16:15.433 --> 16:16.642
Shall we look inside my vault

16:16.726 --> 16:19.853
and see what selling your dragons
would buy me I cannot buy already?

16:20.396 --> 16:21.938
We will get them back.

16:22.565 --> 16:26.693
There is no we,
so why would you help me get them back?

16:26.778 --> 16:30.238
I took you under my protection
in front of the rulers of my city.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.658
A man is what others say he is and no more.

16:33.534 --> 16:37.788
If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar,
my word is worth nothing.

16:38.790 --> 16:41.291
I cannot let this thing happen to you
under my roof.

16:41.376 --> 16:43.585
But it did happen under your roof.

16:43.670 --> 16:47.047
Khaleesi, many times in my life, I have been...

16:47.131 --> 16:48.757
I don't care where you've been.

17:11.906 --> 17:15.784
You think we're savages
because we don't live in stone castles.

17:16.118 --> 17:19.621
We can't make steel as good as yours,
it's true, but...

17:19.997 --> 17:21.373
We're free.

17:22.625 --> 17:25.502
If someone tried to tell us
we couldn't lie down as man and woman,

17:25.586 --> 17:27.796
we'd shove a spear up his arse.

17:28.297 --> 17:31.717
We don't go serving some shit king
who's only king because his father was.

17:32.135 --> 17:33.135
No.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.513
No, you serve Mance Rayder,
the King beyond the Wall.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.974
We chose Mance Rayder to lead us.

17:39.684 --> 17:44.020
He was a crow, same as you,
but he wanted to be free.

17:45.982 --> 17:47.858
You could be free, too.

17:48.651 --> 17:52.487
You don't need to live your whole life
taking commands from old men.

17:53.030 --> 17:55.198
Wake up when you want to wake up.

17:55.825 --> 17:58.869
I could show you the streams to fish,
the woods to hunt.

17:58.953 --> 18:02.289
Build yourself a cabin and
find a woman to lie with in the night.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.209
You're a pretty lad.

18:06.836 --> 18:09.588
The girls would claw each other's eyes out
to get naked with you.

18:12.508 --> 18:13.633
Walk.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.180
I could teach you how to do it.

18:18.556 --> 18:20.348
I know how to do it.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.645
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

18:55.551 --> 18:56.760
And what did she say?

18:57.178 --> 18:59.471
She admired your spirit, Your Grace.

19:00.389 --> 19:01.389
And what then?

19:03.476 --> 19:04.643
She...

19:06.270 --> 19:11.399
if every man were held accountable for the
actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton,

19:11.484 --> 19:12.651
we'd all hang.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.156
She tore the paper in half, Your Grace.

19:19.575 --> 19:20.742
You've acted with honor.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.494
I thank you for it.

19:22.912 --> 19:27.499
Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's
pen is clean, and give him a hot supper.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.252
Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.420
The prisoners from the Yellow Fork.

19:33.214 --> 19:34.589
Too many prisoners.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.300
Is there room for Ser Alton?

19:37.885 --> 19:39.886
Does he need to lie down?

19:43.266 --> 19:44.766
Have the men build him a new pen.

19:45.768 --> 19:47.561
Put him in with the Kingslayer for now.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.646
Have your boy watch over them.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.439
Torrhen.

19:52.608 --> 19:53.775
That will be all.

20:01.117 --> 20:02.117
Your Grace.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.286
A minute of your time?

20:19.093 --> 20:21.219
I've been treating your wounded men.

20:21.304 --> 20:24.973
And my enemies, as some of my bannermen
are fond of mentioning.

20:25.516 --> 20:26.850
They're not my enemies.

20:27.310 --> 20:29.144
That's what I tell my bannermen.

20:29.437 --> 20:32.063
I've already run through the supplies
I brought with me.

20:32.148 --> 20:36.276
Some are easily replaced.
Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses.

20:37.445 --> 20:38.612
But some are not.

20:39.113 --> 20:41.156
I need silk for stitching.

20:43.159 --> 20:47.495
I need fennel root for those with fever,
willow bark. Mostly I need milk of the poppy.

20:48.414 --> 20:50.290
You saw what it was like
to amputate a foot without any.

20:51.834 --> 20:55.211
I assume there will be more loss of limb
before this war is over.

20:56.172 --> 20:59.007
- If you need help finding these...
- I know where to find them.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.636
I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you.

21:03.888 --> 21:05.680
Continue, my lady.

21:10.019 --> 21:12.395
You're riding to the Crag
to negotiate a surrender?

21:12.480 --> 21:13.521
Yes.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.775
The Crag will have a maester
and he will have what I need.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.110
I expect he will.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.279
If I could write a list.

21:21.364 --> 21:23.198
Come with me to the Crag.

21:25.493 --> 21:26.576
I don't think that will be...

21:26.661 --> 21:28.703
Let the maester show you his stores.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.290
I want the wounded men to be treated well,

21:33.376 --> 21:35.001
all the wounded men.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.303
- Children, come inside, quick.
- Come on.

21:45.638 --> 21:46.888
Hurry up!

21:49.558 --> 21:50.767
Can't find anything, ser.

21:50.851 --> 21:53.311
- They've lost the scent.
- Try again.

21:53.562 --> 21:56.815
We've circled this farmhouse twice.
There's no sign of them.

21:56.899 --> 21:59.734
We could start the search fresh
in the morning, my lord.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.654
I'm looking at spending the rest of my life

22:02.738 --> 22:05.573
being treated like a fool and a eunuch
by my own people.

22:05.908 --> 22:09.536
Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn't do
to stop that from happening?

22:09.620 --> 22:13.790
The hounds will find the scent again.
I'll beat them until they do.

22:13.874 --> 22:17.377
I'll whip every man here
until I have both those boys in hand.

22:17.461 --> 22:20.130
And once I've got them,
the pampered little shits...

22:22.299 --> 22:24.634
It's better to be cruel than weak.

22:24.719 --> 22:26.177
Prince Theon.

22:26.971 --> 22:28.638
- Where are they?
- Who, m'lord?

22:28.723 --> 22:30.974
The Stark boys. Where are they?

22:31.058 --> 22:32.392
I don't know. I seen no one.

22:34.437 --> 22:35.603
Think harder.

22:36.439 --> 22:39.399
I swear, m'lord. I don't know.

22:40.151 --> 22:42.277
My lord, over here.

22:45.990 --> 22:48.324
I think I've found what we're looking for.

22:58.461 --> 23:00.170
Send the old man home.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.260
Go back to Winterfell.

23:08.012 --> 23:09.012
Take him back.

23:11.974 --> 23:13.641
Theon, don't do this.

23:32.828 --> 23:35.080
- You came back.
- As soon as I heard.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.874
Do you know anything?

23:39.043 --> 23:41.711
- Irri is dead.
- I know.

23:43.172 --> 23:45.048
- She was a good...
- She's dead.

23:46.092 --> 23:49.260
She died alone.
She died for me and I couldn't protect her.

23:50.971 --> 23:52.055
Doreah?

23:53.099 --> 23:54.182
We can't find her.

23:55.726 --> 23:57.227
She must be dead, too.

23:58.854 --> 24:02.023
I led my people out of the Red Waste
and into the slaughterhouse.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.025
I should have been here.

24:05.486 --> 24:06.986
You went to find me a ship.

24:07.905 --> 24:09.864
My place is by your side.

24:10.032 --> 24:12.200
I shouldn't have left you alone
with these people.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.285
"These people"?

24:14.370 --> 24:16.287
They are not to be trusted.

24:16.372 --> 24:18.039
And who is to be trusted?

24:19.166 --> 24:20.708
Who are my people?

24:21.210 --> 24:22.961
The Targaryens?

24:23.045 --> 24:24.838
I only knew one, my brother,

24:24.922 --> 24:28.383
and he would have let a thousand men
rape me if it had got him the crown.

24:29.260 --> 24:30.718
The Dothraki?

24:31.262 --> 24:34.597
Most of them turned on me the day
that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.

24:34.682 --> 24:36.516
Your people are in Westeros.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.102
The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.

24:39.186 --> 24:41.146
- They will soon enough.
- And then what?

24:41.230 --> 24:43.314
They'll pray for my return?

24:43.399 --> 24:45.733
They'll wave dragon banners
and shout my name?

24:46.735 --> 24:49.154
That's what my brother believed
and he was a fool.

24:49.238 --> 24:51.573
You are not your brother.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.408
Trust me, Khaleesi.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.660
There it is.

24:56.370 --> 24:57.745
"Trust me."

24:58.747 --> 25:01.082
And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah?

25:01.417 --> 25:02.667
Only you?

25:06.088 --> 25:08.298
I don't need trust any longer.

25:09.383 --> 25:11.885
I don't want it and I don't have room for it.

25:12.803 --> 25:16.055
- You are too young to be so...
- And you are too familiar.

25:21.312 --> 25:22.937
Forgive me, Khaleesi.

25:25.399 --> 25:28.902
No one can survive in this world
without help. No one.

25:29.778 --> 25:31.821
Let me help you, please.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.449
Tell me how.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.203
Find my dragons.

25:46.337 --> 25:48.504
How long till we
get back to your crows?

25:50.758 --> 25:52.133
We're close.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.969
What, a day? A half-day?

25:59.808 --> 26:01.726
You don't know, do you?

26:02.478 --> 26:05.230
- Do you even know where they are?
- We're close.

26:06.941 --> 26:09.192
What do you think they'll say
when they hear about you and me?

26:09.276 --> 26:11.277
Nothing happened between you and me.

26:11.487 --> 26:14.822
"I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser,

26:14.907 --> 26:17.242
"we were only close together for warmth.

26:17.660 --> 26:21.829
"And then I felt it,
right up against me backside like a club.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.457
"I can show you the bruise on me tailbone.

26:24.541 --> 26:27.752
"And before I knew what was where,
his... his...

26:27.836 --> 26:30.630
"Well, it was all out in the open,
all angry as you like.

26:30.714 --> 26:34.384
"And I didn't want to want it, but oh, I did!

26:34.927 --> 26:37.679
"And he spread me legs and ruined.

26:38.013 --> 26:39.472
"The shame of it.

26:39.556 --> 26:41.641
"Now I can never marry a perfumed lord.

26:41.725 --> 26:44.352
"What will me poor savage father say?"

26:44.687 --> 26:45.687
Turn back around.

26:45.771 --> 26:47.605
"And I thought that we were done,
but he said,

26:47.690 --> 26:49.691
"'Turn back around."'

26:50.985 --> 26:52.860
I'll tell you what, Jon Snow.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.905
Since it's gonna be your word against mine,

26:55.990 --> 26:58.741
and since you can't
talk about it without blushing,

26:59.451 --> 27:01.202
we may as well just...

27:03.247 --> 27:04.455
What, right here in the muck?

27:05.541 --> 27:07.208
I'll keep you warm enough.

27:09.545 --> 27:11.087
Are you that afraid of it?

27:12.214 --> 27:13.172
That's enough.

27:13.257 --> 27:14.882
It's nice

27:15.592 --> 27:16.801
and wet

27:17.553 --> 27:18.553
and warm.

27:18.887 --> 27:19.887
Enough!

27:21.598 --> 27:22.932
It don't have teeth.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.400
All right!

27:33.902 --> 27:34.902
All right.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.031
Gods, you're dull.

28:14.610 --> 28:16.611
Should have took me
while you had the chance.

28:28.916 --> 28:30.124
No, no!

28:49.478 --> 28:51.187
No. Oh, no.

29:08.163 --> 29:10.164
It's all right. Give me that.

29:10.249 --> 29:14.252
If the Queen sees,
I can have Joffrey's children now.

29:14.962 --> 29:16.003
Help me flip it over.

29:33.230 --> 29:35.565
- Where are you going?
- To tell Her Grace.

29:38.026 --> 29:39.944
You'll say nothing to anyone.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.112
Do you understand?

30:03.218 --> 30:05.636
Your mother might have prepared you.

30:05.721 --> 30:07.722
You flowered, my dear. No more.

30:08.098 --> 30:11.392
My mother told me,
but I thought it would be different.

30:11.477 --> 30:12.477
In what way?

30:13.437 --> 30:15.438
I thought it would be less...

30:16.732 --> 30:18.065
Less messy.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.277
Wait until you birth a child.

30:23.947 --> 30:26.949
You're a woman now.
Do you have any idea what that means?

30:27.743 --> 30:30.036
I'm fit to bear children for the king?

30:30.537 --> 30:32.830
A prospect that once delighted you,

30:32.915 --> 30:35.333
bringing little princes and princesses
into the world,

30:36.710 --> 30:38.586
the greatest honor for a queen.

30:43.759 --> 30:45.384
Joffrey has always been difficult.

30:46.929 --> 30:50.848
Even his birth, I labored a day and a half
to bring him into this world.

30:50.933 --> 30:52.099
You cannot imagine the pain.

30:53.560 --> 30:56.729
I screamed so loudly, I was sure
Robert would hear me in the Kingswood.

30:57.648 --> 30:59.398
His Grace was not with you?

30:59.483 --> 31:00.650
Robert was hunting.

31:01.735 --> 31:02.985
That was his custom.

31:06.114 --> 31:08.115
Whenever my time was near,

31:08.575 --> 31:15.081
my royal husband would flee to the trees
with his huntsmen and his hounds.

31:16.416 --> 31:20.419
And when he returned, he would present me
with some pelts or a stag's head,

31:21.213 --> 31:22.588
and I would present him with a baby.

31:25.133 --> 31:27.385
Not that I wanted him there, mind you.

31:27.469 --> 31:31.472
I had Grand Maester Pycelle,
an army of midwives, and I had my brother.

31:32.599 --> 31:35.476
When they told Jaime
he wasn't allowed in the birthing room,

31:35.978 --> 31:37.311
he smiled

31:37.771 --> 31:40.648
and asked which one of them
proposed to keep him out.

31:44.444 --> 31:46.612
Joffrey will show you no such devotion.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.534
You may never love the king,

31:51.994 --> 31:53.494
but you will love his children.

31:54.288 --> 31:56.455
I love His Grace with all my heart.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.667
That's so very touching to hear.

32:04.715 --> 32:09.010
Permit me to share some womanly wisdom
with you on this very special day.

32:09.845 --> 32:12.305
The more people you love,
the weaker you are.

32:13.932 --> 32:16.934
You'll do things for them
that you know you shouldn't do.

32:17.436 --> 32:20.771
You'll act the fool to make them happy,
to keep them safe.

32:23.692 --> 32:25.985
Love no one but your children.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.362
On that front, a mother has no choice.

32:30.699 --> 32:33.951
But shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?

32:36.997 --> 32:38.372
You can try,

32:40.125 --> 32:41.542
little dove.

32:57.726 --> 33:00.061
Who did you say your mother was again?

33:00.562 --> 33:02.146
Cinda Lannister.

33:02.648 --> 33:03.648
Is she the fat one?

33:05.025 --> 33:06.692
Well, perhaps she's
gotten a little larger than she...

33:06.777 --> 33:09.987
No, no. There's only one fat Lannister.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.490
If she was your mother, you'd know it.

33:15.077 --> 33:17.453
I squired for you once, you know.

33:19.456 --> 33:20.581
When?

33:21.333 --> 33:23.834
The tournament,
the day of Willem Frey's wedding.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.004
I went to Willem Frey's wedding?

33:27.297 --> 33:28.464
You did.

33:29.257 --> 33:32.301
Your squire had gotten so drunk
the night before that he threw up.

33:32.386 --> 33:35.971
He threw up on his horse on the way to
the tourney grounds. What was his name?

33:37.391 --> 33:38.557
Bryan.

33:39.476 --> 33:40.768
Poor lad.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.688
That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall.

33:46.483 --> 33:47.525
I remember you.

33:48.735 --> 33:51.445
You'd never squired for anyone before.

33:51.530 --> 33:54.657
That's right. I ran up and volunteered.
"Let me, my lord. Let me."

33:57.119 --> 33:58.494
My father was furious.

33:59.788 --> 34:03.332
Afraid I'd embarrass our family
in front of the Family.

34:05.585 --> 34:06.794
You didn't, though.

34:07.629 --> 34:08.920
You really remember?

34:09.630 --> 34:13.300
You knew when you were needed
and when to go away. It's a rare talent.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.137
Most of my squires,

34:16.471 --> 34:20.891
they mean well, but young men with big jobs,
they tend to overdo them.

34:21.643 --> 34:23.811
- When I think back to that day...
- Shh!

34:32.987 --> 34:34.321
You were saying?

34:34.864 --> 34:35.864
I...

34:37.451 --> 34:39.952
Never mind. It's embarrassing.

34:40.036 --> 34:44.415
More embarrassing than being chained
to a post covered in your own shit?

34:46.001 --> 34:48.168
I remember everything about that day,

34:48.712 --> 34:50.379
your helmet, your horse,

34:51.005 --> 34:53.507
the rake lines in the dirt along the list,

34:53.884 --> 34:57.595
where the sun was in the sky when
you knocked Balon Swann from his horse,

34:57.679 --> 35:00.514
and the dent in your shield
when you handed it back to me.

35:02.893 --> 35:04.727
I'll remember it all until I die.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.023
That was the best day of my life.

35:12.194 --> 35:15.738
And I remember being on the field
after it was over.

35:16.406 --> 35:19.241
All the competitors were done.
I was the last one out there.

35:21.828 --> 35:22.828
And I couldn't leave.

35:24.706 --> 35:28.501
I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my
family at a table so far on the edge of the feast

35:28.585 --> 35:30.461
you could barely even see the bride.

35:31.213 --> 35:34.590
And I couldn't bear to tell them
what it had been like squiring for you,

35:34.674 --> 35:38.093
when I knew that they could never have
the faintest idea what I was talking about.

35:39.763 --> 35:41.597
I understand completely.

35:41.681 --> 35:42.848
How could you?

35:45.060 --> 35:48.395
Sorry, l... l didn't mean to doubt you.
It's just that l...

35:48.480 --> 35:49.730
I was 16 once.

35:51.316 --> 35:54.610
I also had to replace someone's squire
on short notice.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.237
Which knight was it?

35:57.072 --> 35:58.280
Barristan Selmy.

36:00.909 --> 36:03.536
The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws.
Before your time.

36:05.539 --> 36:06.539
What was he like?

36:09.835 --> 36:11.001
He was...

36:12.838 --> 36:14.171
A painter.

36:16.049 --> 36:18.467
A painter who only used red.

36:21.763 --> 36:26.892
I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that,
not back then.

36:28.061 --> 36:32.106
And to help him do that,
to be a part of something that perfect.

36:34.568 --> 36:36.652
I don't need to explain how that felt,
not to you.

36:38.363 --> 36:39.697
It's hard to put into words.

36:39.781 --> 36:41.031
It's like

36:41.449 --> 36:45.953
stepping into a dream you've been dreaming
for as long as you can remember,

36:46.037 --> 36:47.955
and finding out that the dream

36:48.290 --> 36:50.249
is more real than your life.

36:53.628 --> 36:55.462
Leaving that battlefield was

36:56.631 --> 36:58.632
like being dragged off to prison.

36:59.509 --> 37:01.969
- Did you squire for him again?
- No.

37:03.388 --> 37:04.597
I didn't have your gift.

37:06.474 --> 37:09.393
He couldn't take a step
without stepping on me.

37:09.477 --> 37:11.353
I was awful, a complete liability.

37:12.981 --> 37:19.528
Until one of the outlaws decided
to take on a 16-year-old squire.

37:25.744 --> 37:27.745
It's a good thing I am who I am.

37:29.414 --> 37:31.457
I'd have been useless at anything else.

37:36.588 --> 37:39.465
I'm not well-suited for imprisonment.

37:39.549 --> 37:41.008
Shocking, I know.

37:41.551 --> 37:42.843
Some men are.

37:43.511 --> 37:44.803
Ned Stark,

37:45.722 --> 37:49.475
I imagine he made an excellent prisoner
right up until the end.

37:50.060 --> 37:51.602
Not me, though.

37:52.395 --> 37:55.814
My life has left me
uniquely unfit for constraint.

37:58.568 --> 38:00.569
And have you thought about...

38:00.654 --> 38:02.404
Of course. Every day.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.281
And?

38:06.076 --> 38:10.079
Good prisoners breed good jailers,
apparently.

38:10.622 --> 38:12.247
The Starks are very careful.

38:14.042 --> 38:16.210
But there is a way, I think.

38:18.254 --> 38:20.297
It wasn't possible until now.

38:21.549 --> 38:22.716
What is it?

38:28.223 --> 38:31.058
- It's actually quite simple.
- Well, let me help you.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.560
You'll only have to do one thing.

38:33.979 --> 38:34.979
Tell me.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.067
You'll have to die.

39:33.788 --> 39:35.205
Jorah the Andal.

39:36.666 --> 39:39.084
This man must sail past old Valyria.

39:39.794 --> 39:43.630
All who travel too close to the doom
must have protection.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.549
I didn't come here for lessons.

39:45.633 --> 39:47.885
No, you came for the dragons.

39:48.428 --> 39:49.595
You have them?

39:51.389 --> 39:52.931
Where are they?

39:53.349 --> 39:54.808
Draw your sword.

39:56.269 --> 39:58.479
See what your steel is worth.

40:01.441 --> 40:04.193
You want to please the Mother of Dragons.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.201
You love her.

40:16.164 --> 40:17.706
Where are the dragons?

40:19.584 --> 40:21.585
Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?

40:27.008 --> 40:29.009
Will you betray her again?

40:31.888 --> 40:32.888
Never.

40:39.479 --> 40:40.896
The thief you seek

40:42.148 --> 40:43.732
is with her now.

40:49.489 --> 40:52.783
I did not leave the comfort of my home
to come to yours and be called a thief.

40:52.867 --> 40:54.701
No one is calling you a thief.

40:54.828 --> 40:56.578
Who is she to accuse us?

40:56.663 --> 40:59.790
Please, they're my children. I'm begging you.

40:59.874 --> 41:03.669
Begging us? It wasn't very long ago
you were threatening us.

41:03.753 --> 41:06.046
Without me, the dragons will die.

41:06.214 --> 41:07.881
It will be for the best.

41:08.383 --> 41:12.970
Your dragons will bring the world
nothing but death and misery, my dear.

41:13.596 --> 41:15.848
If I knew where they were,
I would not tell you.

41:15.932 --> 41:17.599
You are cruel, my friend.

41:18.601 --> 41:20.602
The Mother of Dragons is in the right.

41:21.312 --> 41:23.647
She must be reunited with her babies.

41:24.732 --> 41:27.734
- I will help you, Khaleesi.
- How?

41:28.736 --> 41:32.906
I will take you to the House of the Undying
where I have put them.

41:34.742 --> 41:36.493
You have my dragons?

41:36.744 --> 41:41.540
When I learned you were coming to our city,
I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth.

41:43.668 --> 41:45.002
He procured them for me.

41:45.503 --> 41:47.588
But there is no King of Qarth.

41:47.672 --> 41:50.090
There is now.
That was the other half of the arrangement.

41:53.553 --> 41:58.432
You would keep your gates and your minds
closed to everything outside your walls,

41:58.975 --> 42:03.604
but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city
that ever was if it refuses to change.

42:03.688 --> 42:08.609
I will open Qarth to the world
as I have forced it to open itself to me.

42:10.111 --> 42:12.446
Your ambition is an inspiration.

42:13.531 --> 42:16.283
But like all upstarts, you overreach.

42:17.118 --> 42:21.580
Three dragons the size of cats
and an alliance with a charlatan

42:21.664 --> 42:23.582
do not make you a king.

42:24.042 --> 42:26.043
An upstart and a charlatan?

42:26.753 --> 42:28.503
Empires have been built by less.

42:29.547 --> 42:33.050
Those on the margins
often come to control the center,

42:33.134 --> 42:36.887
and those in the center make room for them,
willingly or otherwise.

42:41.809 --> 42:44.478
The Mother of Dragons
will be with her babies.

42:46.397 --> 42:49.775
She will give them her love
and they will thrive by her side,

42:53.863 --> 42:54.863
forever.

43:15.134 --> 43:17.135
A mother should be with her children.

43:20.556 --> 43:22.849
Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn?

43:23.768 --> 43:26.770
Your dragons wait for you
in the House of the Undying.

43:27.188 --> 43:28.689
Come see them.

43:38.449 --> 43:39.908
- Lady Stark!
- No farther.

43:40.368 --> 43:41.952
Keep your hands off me, woman.

43:42.036 --> 43:45.163
Don't enter without an invitation, man.

43:46.791 --> 43:48.750
Forgive me. Lady Stark.

43:49.294 --> 43:51.420
- What is it?
- They caught the Kingslayer.

43:56.467 --> 43:57.592
Kingslayer!

43:57.677 --> 43:59.761
- Kill the fucking Kingslayer! Hang him!
- Hang him!

44:04.350 --> 44:06.059
You'll die today.

44:06.144 --> 44:07.936
Justice for the Karstark.

44:21.576 --> 44:22.659
Gut him!

44:35.673 --> 44:37.758
Get back! I want his head!

44:39.093 --> 44:43.972
Any man who stands between a father
and his vengeance asks for death.

44:44.057 --> 44:45.557
Lord Karstark,

44:46.768 --> 44:48.769
this man is our prisoner.

44:49.562 --> 44:51.146
This monster killed my son.

44:51.272 --> 44:52.773
And crippled mine.

44:53.399 --> 44:57.027
He will answer for his crimes,
I promise you, but not here.

44:57.111 --> 44:59.446
I will have his head.
And if you try and stop me...

44:59.530 --> 45:00.947
You will strike me down?

45:01.908 --> 45:03.909
Have you forgotten me, ser?

45:04.452 --> 45:06.828
I am the widow of your liege,
Lord Eddard Stark.

45:06.913 --> 45:08.205
I am the mother of your king!

45:08.289 --> 45:10.624
- And where is our king now?
- You know very well.

45:10.917 --> 45:12.918
He has gone to the Crag
to accept the surrender.

45:13.002 --> 45:16.463
Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate.

45:16.798 --> 45:19.466
- He brought that foreign bitch with him.
- How dare you!

45:19.717 --> 45:22.552
- Threatening my lady is an act of treason.
- Treason?

45:22.637 --> 45:24.763
How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?

45:24.847 --> 45:28.392
I understand your grief, my lord,
better than most, I understand it.

45:29.352 --> 45:32.521
But in the name of my son,
the King in the North,

45:32.688 --> 45:34.022
stand down.

45:35.942 --> 45:39.778
When your son returns,
I will demand this murderer's head.

45:40.029 --> 45:42.322
Wise men do not make demands of kings.

45:42.407 --> 45:44.825
Fathers who love their sons do.

45:45.535 --> 45:47.327
I will have his head.

45:49.956 --> 45:52.958
Thank you for fighting on my behalf,
Lady Stark.

45:53.042 --> 45:55.252
I would have come to your defense, but...

45:55.336 --> 45:57.587
Take him to the stockades.

45:57.672 --> 45:59.589
Bind him with every chain you can find!

45:59.674 --> 46:01.716
You've become a real she-wolf
in your later years.

46:02.260 --> 46:03.802
There's not much fish left in you.

46:03.886 --> 46:05.303
And gag him!

46:10.810 --> 46:13.311
Since when do you light your own candles?

46:13.396 --> 46:18.358
Since I decided that I can't stand to look at
any of my handmaidens for another instant.

46:20.528 --> 46:23.196
How many times
can you read one raven scroll?

46:23.698 --> 46:29.786
Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted
sailing north past Tarth, 200 ships.

46:29.871 --> 46:33.290
- More than we have.
- Yes, that's more than we have.

46:34.542 --> 46:37.961
He'll be at our gates within five days,
four if he has the wind.

46:38.045 --> 46:40.172
We have strong, high walls.

46:41.090 --> 46:43.592
We'll rain fire down on them from above.

46:44.469 --> 46:48.054
"Rain fire on them from above."
You're quoting Father, aren't you?

46:48.139 --> 46:49.514
Why not?

46:49.599 --> 46:51.349
He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?

46:52.727 --> 46:54.144
Call it tactics, not strategy.

46:54.228 --> 46:56.480
But, yes, he does have a good mind for it.

46:56.564 --> 46:59.774
The best mind, some would say.
Sadly, he's not here.

47:01.319 --> 47:03.111
It's just you, me and Joffrey,

47:03.905 --> 47:07.240
the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

47:09.410 --> 47:10.911
I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.

47:10.995 --> 47:13.580
He needs to start acting like a king.

47:14.415 --> 47:17.167
This war you started
is coming to our doorstep.

47:17.752 --> 47:19.794
And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead...

47:19.879 --> 47:22.214
I'm not the one
giving the boy whores to abuse.

47:23.174 --> 47:24.508
I thought the girls might help him.

47:24.592 --> 47:26.468
- Did you?
- I was wrong.

47:29.722 --> 47:31.765
If we can't control him...

47:32.266 --> 47:33.642
Do you think I haven't tried?

47:36.395 --> 47:38.188
He doesn't listen to me.

47:41.067 --> 47:45.946
It's hard to put a leash on a dog
once you've put a crown on its head.

47:49.825 --> 47:52.160
I always hoped he'd be like Jaime.

47:54.705 --> 47:55.705
He looks like him.

48:00.127 --> 48:01.461
In a certain light.

48:05.466 --> 48:06.925
The boy is more Robert than Jaime.

48:07.635 --> 48:10.470
Robert was a drunken fool,
but he didn't enjoy cruelty.

48:13.641 --> 48:15.308
Sometimes I wonder.

48:16.227 --> 48:17.227
What?

48:18.980 --> 48:20.647
If this is the price

48:22.149 --> 48:23.567
for what we've done,

48:24.443 --> 48:25.777
for our sins.

48:26.529 --> 48:27.654
Sins?

48:29.031 --> 48:30.031
The Targaryens...

48:30.116 --> 48:32.784
Wed brother and sister
for hundreds of years, I know.

48:35.371 --> 48:38.999
That's what Jaime and I would say
to each other in our moments of doubt.

48:39.083 --> 48:42.586
It's what I told Ned Stark
when he was stupid enough to confront me.

48:45.131 --> 48:47.799
Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they?

48:48.009 --> 48:49.467
What's the saying?

48:49.552 --> 48:52.679
"Every time a Targaryen is born,
the Gods flip a coin."

48:54.181 --> 48:55.265
You've beaten the odds.

48:56.350 --> 48:59.853
Tommen and Myrcella are good,
decent children, both of them.

49:29.133 --> 49:31.635
- Then why wait?
- We're sworn to the king.

49:31.719 --> 49:34.054
- There's not a king.
- That's treason.

49:34.138 --> 49:36.139
So is saving Lannisters, yeah?

49:36.223 --> 49:38.058
- Back off, you.
- No, I won't.

49:39.268 --> 49:41.728
Your son returns at dawn, my lady?

49:41.979 --> 49:43.271
So they say.

49:43.356 --> 49:45.106
The Kingslayer won't last the night.

49:46.692 --> 49:48.818
The more they drink, the angrier they'll get.

49:49.779 --> 49:51.946
And when the Karstarks draw their swords...

49:52.948 --> 49:55.241
Who wants to die defending a Lannister?

49:56.744 --> 49:57.744
Come.

50:04.043 --> 50:05.960
He'll not be making it through the night.

50:14.428 --> 50:16.304
I need to be alone with him.

50:16.389 --> 50:20.141
- My lady, our orders...
- Your orders, which I just gave you,

50:20.226 --> 50:22.519
are to leave me alone with him.

50:27.817 --> 50:29.776
Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark?

50:30.903 --> 50:33.446
I believe it's my last night in this world.

50:34.907 --> 50:36.074
Is that a woman?

50:36.575 --> 50:38.493
Do you hear them out there?

50:39.245 --> 50:40.787
They want your head.

50:42.623 --> 50:45.375
Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.

50:45.459 --> 50:48.294
You strangled his son with your chains.

50:48.713 --> 50:50.130
Oh. Oh.

50:50.923 --> 50:52.340
Was he the one on guard duty?

50:55.052 --> 50:56.678
He was in my way.

50:56.971 --> 50:59.806
- Any knight would have done the same.
- You are no knight.

51:00.933 --> 51:03.226
You have forsaken every vow you ever took.

51:03.310 --> 51:04.811
So many vows.

51:05.146 --> 51:06.813
They make you swear and swear.

51:08.149 --> 51:11.151
Defend the king, obey the king,
obey your father,

51:11.569 --> 51:14.154
protect the innocent, defend the weak.

51:14.697 --> 51:17.532
But what if your father despises the king?

51:18.743 --> 51:21.661
What if the king massacres the innocent?

51:22.455 --> 51:23.788
It's too much.

51:24.582 --> 51:27.959
No matter what you do,
you're forsaking one vow or another.

51:28.335 --> 51:30.587
Where did you find this beast?

51:32.173 --> 51:34.758
She is a truer knight than you will ever be,

51:36.177 --> 51:38.470
- Kingslayer.
- Kingslayer.

51:40.347 --> 51:42.056
What a king he was.

51:42.516 --> 51:45.769
Here's to Aerys Targaryen,
the Second of His Name,

51:45.853 --> 51:48.897
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
Protector of the Realm,

51:49.440 --> 51:52.150
and to the sword I shoved in his back.

51:54.528 --> 51:56.654
You are a man without honor.

51:59.033 --> 52:00.241
Do you know,

52:01.202 --> 52:03.703
I've never been with any woman but Cersei.

52:04.330 --> 52:05.955
So in my own way,

52:07.041 --> 52:08.666
I have more honor than

52:10.252 --> 52:12.170
poor old dead Ned.

52:14.089 --> 52:16.216
What was the name of
that bastard he fathered?

52:16.300 --> 52:18.343
- Brienne.
- No, that wasn't it.

52:20.054 --> 52:23.139
Snow, a bastard from the North.

52:25.059 --> 52:29.270
Now, when... When good old Ned
came home with some whore's baby,

52:30.314 --> 52:32.023
did you pretend to love it?

52:33.734 --> 52:34.734
No.

52:35.528 --> 52:37.570
You're not very good at pretending.

52:37.738 --> 52:39.614
You're an honest woman.

52:40.533 --> 52:42.826
You hated that boy, didn't you?

52:43.869 --> 52:45.787
How could you not hate him?

52:45.996 --> 52:48.248
The walking, talking reminder

52:48.624 --> 52:52.043
that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark

52:52.419 --> 52:54.045
fucked another woman.

52:57.341 --> 52:58.508
Your sword.

53:04.682 --> 53:06.349
I told you what would happen.

53:07.768 --> 53:09.269
All of you.

53:10.896 --> 53:13.898
I told you what would happen
if you served me loyally.

53:15.609 --> 53:17.527
And what would happen if you did not.

53:17.945 --> 53:20.655
What are you doing? What have you done?

53:20.739 --> 53:24.576
If there are any who still question
whether your new lord means what he says,

53:27.621 --> 53:29.455
here is the answer to your question.

53:39.341 --> 53:41.968
No!
