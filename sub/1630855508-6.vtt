Get everyone to ignore you
so you're really surprised

16:51.719 --> 16:52.929
when the party happens.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.513
- You were really good at it.

16:54.513 --> 16:55.932
It's just--
[scoffs]

16:55.932 --> 16:59.518
Today, everything--
and with my mom here--

16:59.518 --> 17:02.188
you know, she is what she is.

17:02.188 --> 17:05.650
And I know she loves me...
or something.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.193
- Yeah.
You know, I'm kind of surprised

17:07.193 --> 17:08.527
you wanted to spend
your birthday with her.

17:08.527 --> 17:09.904
Your mom's a lot.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.781
- Huh. She is, isn't she?

17:11.781 --> 17:13.366
- I mean, who am I to say?

17:13.366 --> 17:15.243
I grew up
with some big personalities.

17:15.243 --> 17:17.161
But honestly, there's something
that you don't seem

17:17.161 --> 17:19.705
to understand that I feel
like you should know.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.749
Your mom sucks.

17:21.749 --> 17:22.792
- Whoa.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.627
She does, doesn't she?

17:24.627 --> 17:26.170
- I mean, she puts on
a great show.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.964
Don't get me wrong.
But she sucks.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.633
- My mom sucks.

17:30.633 --> 17:33.177
[laughing] Why does that feel
like good news?

17:33.177 --> 17:34.220
- Exactly.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.221
So did we do it?

17:35.221 --> 17:36.305
Are you happy?

17:36.305 --> 17:38.474
- Oh, my God.

17:38.474 --> 17:41.727
I am happy on my birthday.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.062
[screams]
[both laugh]

17:43.062 --> 17:44.897
- Yes!

17:44.897 --> 17:47.441
- Petey, happy birthday!

17:47.441 --> 17:49.026
Get in here, sweet girl.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.528
Take a hit of the good stuff.

17:50.528 --> 17:53.239
- [gasps] I've been waiting
for this all day.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.532
Yay!

17:54.532 --> 17:55.866
Mae Mae hug.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.369
Ooh, I feel like a dog
in a ThunderShirt.

17:58.369 --> 17:59.870
Where have you been all day?

17:59.870 --> 18:01.414
- I'm so sorry.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.833
I can't keep secrets,
so I had to skedaddle.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.626
- You can't keep secrets?

18:05.626 --> 18:07.753
How was that possible
working for my dad?

18:07.753 --> 18:08.796
- Oh, no, silly.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.464
I mean fun secrets.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.675
It's wicked secrets
I eat for morning meal.

18:14.176 --> 18:17.346

bag of bones doing here?

18:17.346 --> 18:18.556
- Oh, she's here for my party.

18:18.556 --> 18:19.640
Eliza extorted her.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.392
- Oh, that's nice.

18:21.392 --> 18:23.352
Good friend.

18:23.352 --> 18:26.105
- It's like being in
a straitjacket who loves you.

18:27.898 --> 18:30.192
- Thanks for your help
with my surprise party.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.361
It's really nice.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.989
You're a good...friend.

18:34.989 --> 18:36.073

18:36.073 --> 18:39.744
You are...a friend to me...

18:39.744 --> 18:43.289
is how I think of you
on your birthday.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.791
- Oh, and I really hope
things work out with Polly.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.293
I hope she's not mad.
- Oh, my gosh, mad?

18:47.293 --> 18:49.086
- [gasps]
- Mad about what?

18:49.086 --> 18:52.173
Bandit was such a gentleman
leaving me the truck.

18:52.173 --> 18:53.799
He did take the keys,
so I had to walk

18:53.799 --> 18:55.009
8 miles back in the rain,

18:55.009 --> 18:57.178
but you know how men are,

18:57.178 --> 19:00.681
just so forgetful
about the details.

19:02.308 --> 19:03.893
I love when Bandit forgets me.

19:03.893 --> 19:06.145
It's our own
fun little inside joke.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.606
- You didn't ask me
if you could have a party here.

19:08.606 --> 19:10.024
How'd you even
know it'd be open

19:10.024 --> 19:11.734
or if she would even be here?

19:11.734 --> 19:13.319
- I didn't have to.
I know you.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.279
And I knew you'd find a way
to get her alone today.

19:15.279 --> 19:17.114
- Now it looks like
I was in on it!

19:17.114 --> 19:19.408
- Isn't it better that it looks
like you were in on it

19:19.408 --> 19:22.870
versus the alternative?

19:22.870 --> 19:24.872
- So let me get this straight.

19:24.872 --> 19:28.793
You left me to come hang out
with Petey in this barn?

19:28.793 --> 19:30.461
I get it. It's her birthday.

19:30.461 --> 19:32.963
I'll go wait in the truck.
Come on, Hydrangea.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.640
And you didn't even get hurt
on my birthday.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.100
- Make a wish, bitch!

19:44.100 --> 19:46.936
- Hmm, I...

19:46.936 --> 19:48.562
hope my mom dies.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.523
- Whoa, okay!
Pull it back.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.482
- Yeah, okay.

19:54.443 --> 19:55.528
- Ella, I know
every year on my birthday,

19:55.528 --> 19:57.196
you get really hurt.
