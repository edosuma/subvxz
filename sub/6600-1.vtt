00:23.441 --> 00:25.694
Dispatcher:
Orange County Fire Rescue.

00:25.860 --> 00:28.655
Woman:
6600 Sea Harbor Drive.

00:28.822 --> 00:30.907
SeaWorld Stadium.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.701
Dispatcher:
Okay.

00:33.993 --> 00:35.870
Woman: We actually have
a trainer in the water

00:36.037 --> 00:37.872
with one of our whales--

00:38.039 --> 00:39.874
the whale that they're not supposed
to be in the water with.

00:40.041 --> 00:41.876
Dispatcher: Okay.
We'll get somebody en route.

00:42.043 --> 00:44.421
Woman: Okay, through gate #3
to Shamu Stadium.

00:44.587 --> 00:45.588
Dispatcher:
Gate 3.

00:53.096 --> 00:55.014
Dispatcher #2:
Orange County Sheriff's Office.

00:55.181 --> 00:56.933
Man:
We need SO to respond

00:57.100 --> 00:59.269
for a dead person at SeaWorld.

01:00.812 --> 01:03.189
Uh, a whale has eaten one of the trainers.

01:05.859 --> 01:08.194
Dispatcher #2:
A whale ate one of the trainers?

01:08.361 --> 01:09.738
Man:
That's correct.

01:12.073 --> 01:14.909
( Applause )

01:27.088 --> 01:29.716
( instrumental music playing )

01:34.971 --> 01:37.515
Narrator:
Do you believe?

01:37.682 --> 01:39.851
My parents first brought me to a SeaWorld park

01:40.018 --> 01:41.060
when I was very young.

01:42.979 --> 01:46.191
From that point forward, I was hooked.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.652
It meant everything to me because

01:49.819 --> 01:51.780
I'd never wanted anything more.

01:51.946 --> 01:54.240
I remember being probably
in first or second grade

01:54.407 --> 01:56.367
watching National Geographic specials

01:56.534 --> 01:57.702
or Mutual of Omaha specials

01:57.869 --> 02:00.121
and seeing whales and seeing dolphins
and as a little kid

02:00.288 --> 02:02.040
just being really incredibly inspired by it.

02:02.207 --> 02:03.750
I never went to SeaWorld.

02:03.917 --> 02:05.502
I grew up in New York,
so I went to the Bronx Zoo.

02:05.668 --> 02:07.921
Grew up on a lake with horses.
We'd swim the horses.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.088
I grew up around the ocean.

02:09.255 --> 02:11.966
I came from the middle of the country
in flatland Kansas.

02:12.133 --> 02:13.134
I'm from Virginia.

02:13.301 --> 02:15.512
Traveled down, did the theme park thing

02:15.678 --> 02:18.389
in Orlando when I was 17

02:18.556 --> 02:23.019
and saw the night show at Shamu Stadium.

02:23.186 --> 02:26.022
Very emotional, you know, popular music.

02:26.189 --> 02:29.943
And I was just-- I was very driven
to want to do that.

02:32.612 --> 02:34.614
Kim Ashdown:
Then I saw what the trainers did...

02:35.949 --> 02:37.450
and I said,
"That's what I want to do."

02:40.995 --> 02:42.247
Dean Gomersall:
One of the trainers there, he goes,

02:42.413 --> 02:44.123
"What are you doing out there?
You should be a trainer."

02:44.290 --> 02:45.500
I go, "I don't know how to train animals.

02:45.667 --> 02:46.876
I've never trained animals
in my life."

02:47.043 --> 02:49.128
How do you prepare yourself for an encounter

02:49.295 --> 02:52.048
with an 8,000-pound Orcinus orca?

02:52.215 --> 02:54.759
Ashdown: I always thought
you needed, like, a master's degree

02:54.926 --> 02:56.469
in marine biology to be a trainer.

02:56.636 --> 02:59.889
James Earl Jones: It takes years
of study and experience

03:00.056 --> 03:02.308
to meet the strict requirements necessary

03:02.475 --> 03:05.353
to interact in the water with Shamu.

03:05.520 --> 03:07.522
Ashdown: Come to find out,
it really is more about

03:07.689 --> 03:09.941
your personality and how good you can swim.

03:10.108 --> 03:12.026
I went and tried out, got the job right away.

03:12.193 --> 03:13.778
I'm like, "Yeah!"
So excited, you know.

03:13.945 --> 03:15.905
I was so, so excited.

03:16.072 --> 03:18.366
Berg: I really wanted to be there.
I really wanted to do the job.

03:18.533 --> 03:20.994
I couldn't wait to get in the water
with the animals.

03:21.160 --> 03:23.371
I really was proud of being a SeaWorld trainer.

03:23.538 --> 03:26.416
You know, I thought this was
the most amazing job.

03:27.792 --> 03:30.879
I showed up there on my first day,
not really knowing what to expect.

03:31.045 --> 03:33.756
I was told to put on a wetsuit
and get in the water.

03:33.923 --> 03:35.091
Hi, Mom!

03:35.258 --> 03:38.344
Oh, I was scared out of my wits.

03:38.511 --> 03:40.263
First of all, I put my wetsuit on backwards

03:40.430 --> 03:43.308
because I was raised on a farm in Virginia.

03:43.474 --> 03:45.393
- Hi, Dad!
- My first thought

03:45.560 --> 03:48.646
and memory of that time
was that dolphins are a lot bigger...

03:48.813 --> 03:50.815
- ( clicking )
- ...heh, than they look

03:50.982 --> 03:52.400
when you get in the water next to them.

03:52.567 --> 03:55.069
Well, I watched the Sea Lion & Otter Show,

03:55.236 --> 03:56.571
and this guy, Mike Morocco,

03:56.738 --> 04:01.576
he comes out during the show
with a dress on as Dorky,

04:01.743 --> 04:03.494
the alter ego of Dorothy--

04:03.661 --> 04:06.831
in a dress with a sea lion,
the Coward Sea Lion, right?

04:06.998 --> 04:08.416
And he's walking along with this little basket,

04:08.583 --> 04:11.294
and I go, "I will never,
ever do that."

04:11.461 --> 04:13.379
You know?
Two months later...

04:13.546 --> 04:14.714
( high voice )
Hi, I'm Dorky!

04:14.881 --> 04:16.673
( laughing )

04:16.841 --> 04:18.885
Walking out onstage with a sea lion.

04:26.184 --> 04:28.853
Ashdown: I was overwhelmed
and I was so excited.

04:30.563 --> 04:32.774
I mean, just seeing a killer whale...

04:33.983 --> 04:35.360
is breathtaking.

04:38.404 --> 04:40.406
John Jett:
I was just in awe.

04:40.573 --> 04:42.992
It's shocking to see how large they are

04:43.159 --> 04:44.327
and how beautiful they are.

04:45.620 --> 04:47.580
Berg: Being in the presence
of the killer whales

04:47.747 --> 04:49.749
was just inspiring and amazing,

04:49.916 --> 04:51.250
and I remember seeing them for the first time,

04:51.417 --> 04:54.170
just not being able to believe
how huge they were.

04:56.756 --> 04:59.467
You're there because you want to train
killer whales and that's your goal.

04:59.634 --> 05:02.345
Trainers:
Yay!

05:02.512 --> 05:04.013
Berg: I didn't know
it was going to happen,

05:04.180 --> 05:05.223
so I wasn't expecting it.

05:05.390 --> 05:07.642
And one day they say,
"Okay, Sam, you're ready to go."

05:07.809 --> 05:09.143
Woman:
Come on, you got it.

05:09.310 --> 05:11.646
Berg: "You're going to stand
on the whale.

05:11.813 --> 05:14.107
You're going to dive off the whale.

05:14.273 --> 05:16.526
The whale's going to swim under you
and pick you up again.

05:16.693 --> 05:19.320
And then you're going to do
a perimeter ride around the pool."

05:19.487 --> 05:20.905
Man:
Good!

05:21.072 --> 05:23.282
Keep moving.
Ride him to the slide-out.

05:23.449 --> 05:25.243
( Cheering )

05:25.410 --> 05:27.787
Berg: They just told me
to go do it and I did it.

05:27.954 --> 05:30.123
Wow, I did-- I just rode
a killer whale.

05:30.289 --> 05:32.291
( Cheering and applause )

05:32.458 --> 05:34.460
Woman:
Yay, girly!

05:37.922 --> 05:40.633
When you look into their eyes,
you know somebody is home.

05:40.800 --> 05:41.968
Somebody's looking back.

05:42.135 --> 05:46.014
You form a very personal relationship
with your animal.

05:46.180 --> 05:49.142
There's something absolutely amazing

05:49.308 --> 05:53.104
about working with an animal.

05:53.271 --> 05:54.981
You are a team.

05:55.148 --> 05:56.983
You build a relationship together.

05:57.150 --> 06:01.237
You both understand the goal
and you help each other.

06:01.404 --> 06:04.073
I've been with this whale
since I was 18 years old

06:04.240 --> 06:07.035
and I've seen her have all four of her babies.

06:07.201 --> 06:09.704
- ( Squeaking )
- We've grown up together. Huh?

06:09.871 --> 06:11.456
That's the joy I got out of it.

06:11.622 --> 06:14.459
It's a relationship like I've never had.

06:31.476 --> 06:33.144
Dawn Brancheau: Bro,
I have to know-- are you nervous?

06:33.311 --> 06:34.729
- I'm scared.
-( laughter)

06:34.896 --> 06:36.355
- Ventre: Oh, no.
- Gomersall: Nice hair, Jeff.

06:36.522 --> 06:37.815
( laughter)

06:37.982 --> 06:39.901
( cackling )

06:40.943 --> 06:42.278
Did you see anything?

06:42.445 --> 06:45.239
Ventre: Projection for the future
of Jeff Ventre.

06:45.406 --> 06:48.159
Jeff Ventre is going to go over there,
he's going to shine.

06:48.326 --> 06:49.786
- You're going to notice...
- Berg: Dawn.

06:49.952 --> 06:51.954
- Oh, that's Dawn.
- Ventre: Wow.

06:52.121 --> 06:54.123
He's going to be my supervisor one day.

06:54.290 --> 06:55.792
There you go.

06:58.544 --> 07:01.255
Ventre: I knew Dawn
when she was new.

07:01.422 --> 07:02.507
She was a great person to work with

07:02.673 --> 07:06.344
and she obviously blossomed
into one of SeaWorld's best trainers.

07:06.511 --> 07:07.845
This is Dawn Brancheau.

07:08.012 --> 07:11.265
Dawn is the senior trainer
here at Shamu Stadium.

07:11.432 --> 07:14.268
I guess you could say
I kind of knew Dawn in a past life.

07:14.435 --> 07:15.436
Reporter:
It's a tough job, isn't it?

07:15.603 --> 07:17.814
Yeah, we really do go through
a lot of physical exertion.

07:17.980 --> 07:20.316
You can see in the show
we do a lot of deepwater work,

07:20.483 --> 07:23.361
breath holds, very high-energy
behaviors with animals.

07:23.528 --> 07:25.154
Obviously they're giving out
a lot of energy too,

07:25.321 --> 07:27.532
but we're working together
and having a lot of fun as well.

07:27.698 --> 07:30.576
She's beautiful, she's blonde,
she's athletic, she's friendly.

07:30.743 --> 07:32.036
You know, everybody loves Dawn.

07:32.203 --> 07:33.579
And I mean this so sincerely,

07:33.746 --> 07:36.082
watching you perform yesterday--
you're amazing.

07:36.249 --> 07:37.667
- Thank you.
- You really are.

07:37.834 --> 07:41.629
Berg: She captured what it means
to be a SeaWorld trainer.

07:41.796 --> 07:43.840
She had so much experience
that it made me realize

07:44.006 --> 07:47.093
what happened to her
really could have happened to anyone.

07:53.891 --> 07:54.934
Revere:
This is Detective Revere

07:55.101 --> 07:56.185
with the Orange County Sheriff's Office.

07:56.352 --> 07:58.813
Today's date is February 24, 2010.

07:58.980 --> 08:00.106
The time is 4:16.

08:00.273 --> 08:02.984
In the room with me right now
is a Thomas George Tobin.

08:03.151 --> 08:04.610
- Is that correct?
- Tobin: Correct.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.549
- Revere: So the arm is nowhere...
- Tobin: Right.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.894
Jett: OSHA, on behalf
of the federal government,

08:38.059 --> 08:40.313
is basically suggesting that swimming with orcas

08:40.479 --> 08:43.065
is inherently dangerous
and that you can't completely predict

08:43.232 --> 08:46.736
the outcome when you enter the water
or enter their environment.

08:46.903 --> 08:49.113
Dave Duff us:
That's the crux of the OSHA case.

08:50.406 --> 08:54.285
Stay out of proximity with the animals
and you won't get killed.

08:54.452 --> 08:57.413
It will have a ripple effect
through the whole industry.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.707
This was national headline news.

08:59.874 --> 09:01.375
Martha Sugalski:
SeaWorld's whale performances

09:01.542 --> 09:02.585
may never be the same.

09:02.752 --> 09:04.879
Right now the theme park is arguing in court

09:05.046 --> 09:06.547
to keep whale trainers in the water,

09:06.714 --> 09:09.050
something OSHA says is extremely dangerous.

09:09.217 --> 09:11.761
These are wild animals,
and they are unpredictable

09:11.928 --> 09:13.179
because we don't speak whale.

09:13.346 --> 09:14.931
We don't speak whale, we don't speak tiger,

09:15.097 --> 09:16.724
we don't speak monkey.

09:16.891 --> 09:18.684
Sugalski: And tempers flared
between the two sides today

09:18.851 --> 09:21.687
when OSHA's attorney suggested
that SeaWorld only made changes

09:21.854 --> 09:25.024
after trainer Dawn Brancheau's death
outraged the public.

09:25.191 --> 09:27.568
Reporter: OSHA doesn't want
the trainers going back in the water

09:27.735 --> 09:30.863
without a physical barrier
between them and the whales.

09:31.030 --> 09:35.076
Being in close proximity
to these top predators is too dangerous.

09:35.243 --> 09:36.661
Anderson Cooper: They won't then
be getting in the water

09:36.827 --> 09:38.829
riding on the whales, things like that.

09:38.996 --> 09:42.250
If you were in a bathtub for 25 years,
don't you think you'd get

09:42.416 --> 09:46.045
a little irritated, aggravated,
maybe a little psychotic?

09:49.173 --> 09:52.510
The situation with Dawn Brancheau--
it didn't just happen.

09:52.677 --> 09:53.761
It's not a singular event.

09:53.928 --> 09:58.808
You have to go back over 20 years
to understand this.

10:10.194 --> 10:12.280
It was a really exciting thing to do

10:12.446 --> 10:14.865
and so everybody wanted to do it.

10:15.032 --> 10:17.326
Interviewer: What were they
telling you you were going to do?

10:17.493 --> 10:21.872
Mm, capture orcas.

10:22.039 --> 10:24.333
- Man: Whoo-hoo!
-( plane buzzing )

10:24.500 --> 10:25.751
Howard Garrett:
They had aircraft,

10:25.918 --> 10:27.837
they had spotters, they had speedboats,

10:28.004 --> 10:30.589
they had bombs they were throwing in the water.

10:30.756 --> 10:31.757
( Explosion )

10:31.924 --> 10:35.469
They were lighting their bombs
with acetylene torches in their boats

10:35.636 --> 10:37.430
and throwing them as fast as they could

10:37.596 --> 10:40.349
- to herd the whales into coves.
- ( explosion )

10:40.516 --> 10:41.976
Whoo!

10:42.143 --> 10:43.811
But the orcas had been caught before

10:43.978 --> 10:45.646
and they knew what was going on

10:45.813 --> 10:48.357
and they knew their young ones
would be taken from them.

10:48.524 --> 10:53.612
So the adults without young
went east into a cul-de-sac

10:53.779 --> 10:57.491
and the boats followed them,
thinking they were all going that way,

10:57.658 --> 11:00.661
while the mothers with babies went north.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.830
But the capture teams had aircraft.

11:02.997 --> 11:05.541
And they have to come up for air eventually.

11:05.708 --> 11:08.586
And when they did,
the capture teams alerted the boats

11:08.753 --> 11:11.839
and said, "Oh, no, they're going north--
the ones with babies."

11:12.006 --> 11:14.717
So the boats-- the speedboats
caught them there

11:14.884 --> 11:16.385
and herded them in.

11:17.386 --> 11:19.805
And then they had fishing boats with seine nets

11:19.972 --> 11:22.975
that they would stretch across
so none could leave

11:23.142 --> 11:25.519
and then they could just pick out
the young ones.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.865
We were only after the little ones.

11:38.032 --> 11:41.994
And a little one is, you know,
a big animal still.

11:42.161 --> 11:44.455
But I was told because of shipping costs

11:44.622 --> 11:47.083
that's why they only take the little ones.

11:49.085 --> 11:52.880
Garrett: They had the young ones
that they wanted in the corrals,

11:53.047 --> 11:54.340
so they dropped the seine nets.

11:54.507 --> 11:57.259
And all the others could have left,
but they stayed.

12:00.930 --> 12:05.226
We're there, trying to get
the young orca into the stretcher,

12:05.393 --> 12:08.562
and the whole famn damily is out here,

12:08.729 --> 12:10.564
25 yards away maybe,

12:10.731 --> 12:13.025
- in a big line...
- ( orcas vocalizing )

12:13.192 --> 12:16.112
...and they're communicating
back and forth.

12:16.278 --> 12:17.780
Well...

12:19.281 --> 12:22.743
you understand then what you're doing, you know.

12:24.370 --> 12:26.956
( Orcas vocalizing )

12:27.957 --> 12:29.917
I-- I lost it.

12:30.084 --> 12:32.837
I mean, I just started crying.

12:33.003 --> 12:35.214
I didn't stop working,

12:35.381 --> 12:37.133
but I...

12:37.299 --> 12:40.761
you know, I just couldn't handle it.

12:42.847 --> 12:46.100
Just like kidnapping a little kid
away from their mother.

12:47.184 --> 12:49.937
Everybody's watching.
What can you do?

12:52.523 --> 12:54.316
It's the worst thing I can think of, you know?

12:54.483 --> 12:57.069
I can't think of anything worse than that.

12:58.112 --> 13:00.948
Now, and this really sounds bad,

13:01.115 --> 13:04.410
but when the whole hunt was over,

13:04.577 --> 13:08.205
there were three dead whales in the net.

13:08.372 --> 13:10.749
And...

13:10.916 --> 13:14.962
so they had Peter and Brian and I...

13:15.963 --> 13:20.217
cut the whales open, fill them with rocks,

13:20.384 --> 13:22.761
put anchors on their tail, and sink them.

13:24.889 --> 13:26.432
Well...

13:27.892 --> 13:29.643
you know...

13:30.895 --> 13:33.606
really, I didn't even think about it

13:33.772 --> 13:35.483
being illegal at that point.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.776
I thought it was a PR thing.

13:38.777 --> 13:42.448
They were finally ejected
from the State of Washington

13:42.615 --> 13:45.451
by a court order in 1976.

13:45.618 --> 13:48.078
It was SeaWorld by name that was told,

13:48.245 --> 13:51.457
"Do not come back to Washington
to capture whales."

13:51.624 --> 13:55.794
Without missing a beat, they went
from Washington to Iceland

13:55.961 --> 13:57.963
and began capturing there.

14:01.675 --> 14:04.637
I've been part of a revolution
and two change of presidents

14:04.803 --> 14:07.097
in Central and South America...

14:08.516 --> 14:12.186
and seen some things that's hard to believe,

14:12.353 --> 14:15.648
but this is the worst thing
that I've ever done--

14:16.732 --> 14:18.651
is hunt that whale.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.728
( Instrumental music playing )

14:54.895 --> 14:58.274
Narrator: Sealand has been
a part of Victoria for over 20 years.

14:58.440 --> 15:02.319
We specialize in the care
and display of killer whales.

15:05.281 --> 15:07.366
By the time I started, when he was four,

15:07.533 --> 15:11.370
he was up to 16 feet long
and weighed 4,000 pounds.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.082
Announcer:
Tilikum, up again.

15:15.249 --> 15:16.667
- Thank you.
- ( whistle blows )

15:16.834 --> 15:19.128
I had actually seen Tilikum
quite a number of times.

15:19.295 --> 15:22.381
He was right across the street here in Victoria.

15:22.548 --> 15:24.550
Announcer: Now, this show
can get a little bit soggy at times.

15:24.717 --> 15:27.720
Balcomb: All Sealand was
was a net hanging in a marina

15:27.886 --> 15:29.888
with a float around it.

15:31.098 --> 15:34.184
Tilikum was the one
we really loved to work with.

15:34.351 --> 15:38.188
He was very well behaved
and he was always eager to please.

15:38.355 --> 15:41.609
When he was first introduced,
everything just went fine and dandy,

15:41.775 --> 15:44.194
but the previous head trainer

15:44.361 --> 15:46.864
used techniques that involved punishment.

15:47.031 --> 15:51.118
He would team a trained orca up
with Tilikum who was untrained.

15:51.285 --> 15:53.954
He would send them both off
to do the same behavior.

15:54.121 --> 15:57.791
If Tilikum didn't do it,
then both animals were punished.

15:57.958 --> 16:00.252
Deprived of food to keep them hungry,

16:00.419 --> 16:03.213
this caused a lot of frustration
with the larger animal,

16:03.380 --> 16:04.673
the established animal,

16:04.840 --> 16:07.217
and would in turn get frustrated with Tilikum

16:07.384 --> 16:09.803
and would rake him with his teeth.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.972
There would be times during certain seasons

16:12.139 --> 16:15.559
that Tilikum would be covered
head to toe with rakes.

16:15.726 --> 16:18.479
Rakes are teeth on teeth and raking the skin.

16:18.646 --> 16:20.481
And from head to toe you could see blood

16:20.648 --> 16:24.401
and you could see scratches,
and he would just be raked up.

16:24.568 --> 16:26.987
Walters: Both females
would gang up on him.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.697
Tilikum was the one we trusted.

16:28.864 --> 16:31.075
We never were concerned about Tilikum.

16:31.241 --> 16:34.411
The issue was really that we stored
these whales at night

16:34.578 --> 16:37.748
in what we call a module,
which was 20 feet across

16:37.915 --> 16:41.418
and probably 30 feet deep as a safety precaution

16:41.585 --> 16:44.046
because we were worried about people
cutting the net and letting them go.

16:44.213 --> 16:47.132
And the lights were all turned out,
so there was really no stimulation.

16:47.299 --> 16:51.303
They're just in this dark,
metal 20x30-foot pool

16:51.470 --> 16:53.722
for two-thirds of their life.

16:57.726 --> 16:59.186
Huxter:
When we first started,

16:59.353 --> 17:01.188
they were quite small and quite young.

17:01.355 --> 17:02.898
So they fit in there quite nicely,

17:03.065 --> 17:05.943
but they were immobile for the most part.

17:07.778 --> 17:10.489
It didn't feel good.
It just didn't.

17:10.656 --> 17:12.532
And it was just wrong.

17:12.700 --> 17:14.742
We started having difficulty getting them all

17:14.910 --> 17:18.372
into this one small steel box, to be honest.

17:18.539 --> 17:20.457
That's what it was.
It was a floating steel box.

17:20.624 --> 17:22.334
Walters: That's where
food deprivation would come in.

17:22.501 --> 17:25.128
We would hold back food,

17:25.295 --> 17:26.630
and they would know if they went in the module

17:26.797 --> 17:27.798
that they would get their food.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.591
So if they're hungry enough,
they're going to go in there.

17:29.758 --> 17:31.176
And during the winter that would be

17:31.343 --> 17:34.555
from 5:00 at night
till 7:00 in the morning.

17:34.722 --> 17:36.390
When you let them out,
you'd see these new tooth rakes

17:36.557 --> 17:38.308
and sometimes you'd see blood.

17:38.475 --> 17:40.853
Closing that door on him

17:41.019 --> 17:44.690
and knowing that he's locked in there
for the whole night is like...

17:47.151 --> 17:49.486
it's a stab, it's a "whoa."

17:49.653 --> 17:53.490
If that is true, it's not only inhumane,

17:53.657 --> 17:55.659
and I'll tell them so...
( chuckles )

17:55.826 --> 18:00.038
but it probably led to what I think
is a psychosis that...

18:01.582 --> 18:03.333
he was on a hair trigger.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.252
He'd kill.

18:06.420 --> 18:08.422
( Seagulls screeching )

18:12.718 --> 18:15.929
( sirens wailing )

18:16.096 --> 18:18.140
( overlapping voices ) An employee
is dead after an encounter...

18:18.307 --> 18:21.143
...at a Canadian park
called Sealand of the Pacific.

18:21.310 --> 18:24.021
The victim, Keltie Byrne,
was a championship swimmer

18:24.188 --> 18:26.106
and a part-time worker at Sealand.

18:26.273 --> 18:29.693
As seen in this home video,
rescuers used a huge net to try...

18:29.860 --> 18:32.488
...rescue workers' efforts
were hindered by the agitated whales.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.782
I'd like to make
the Pan Pacific team this summer,

18:34.948 --> 18:39.244
but my more immediate goal
is just to swim fast at nationals.

18:46.001 --> 18:47.836
Kallen:
It was sort of a cloudy, gray day

18:48.003 --> 18:49.671
and we were looking for something to do,

18:49.838 --> 18:52.090
so we thought,
"Why not go to Sealand?"

18:52.257 --> 18:56.470
It was kind of like this dingy pool
with these whales and--

18:56.637 --> 18:58.847
it just felt a little bit like an amusement park

18:59.014 --> 19:02.893
that was kind of on its last legs
and everything was a bit gray.

19:03.060 --> 19:04.812
Yeah. It was like
a swimming pool.

19:04.978 --> 19:05.979
- Yeah, yeah.
- You know,

19:06.146 --> 19:07.815
three whales in a swimming pool.

19:07.981 --> 19:08.982
Yeah.

19:09.149 --> 19:12.569
And they would come up
and touch the ball and there was--

19:12.736 --> 19:16.031
I think there was some tail splashing
and there was some--

19:16.198 --> 19:18.408
- Some jumping.
- The fish. And--

19:18.575 --> 19:21.954
They hold the fish and the whales jump up.

19:22.120 --> 19:25.374
I remember saying, "Oh, what a fun job.

19:25.541 --> 19:28.961
You know, she's so lucky."

19:29.127 --> 19:32.506
And then I saw her walking with her rubber boots

19:32.673 --> 19:35.843
and she tripped and her foot
just dipped into the edge of the pool

19:36.009 --> 19:38.470
and she lost her balance and fell in.

19:38.637 --> 19:42.224
And then she was pushing her way up
to get out of the pool

19:42.391 --> 19:44.893
and the whale zoomed over, grabbed her boot,

19:45.060 --> 19:46.520
and pulled her back in.

19:46.687 --> 19:48.772
At first, I didn't think it was that serious

19:48.939 --> 19:52.609
because you see the trainer
in the pool with the whale

19:52.776 --> 19:56.154
and you think, "Oh, well,
the whales are used to that."

19:56.321 --> 19:58.866
And then all of a sudden,
it started getting--

19:59.032 --> 20:02.369
there was more swimming,
more activity, more thrashing,

20:02.536 --> 20:04.288
and she was starting to get panicked.

20:04.454 --> 20:07.207
And then as it progressed,
you started to realize,

20:07.374 --> 20:09.668
"Whoa, something's not right here."

20:09.835 --> 20:12.713
She started to scream
and she started looking around

20:12.880 --> 20:15.132
and her eyes were, like, bigger and bigger

20:15.299 --> 20:17.926
and realizing that,
"I really am in trouble here."

20:18.093 --> 20:21.138
And then they would pull her under.

20:21.305 --> 20:23.181
And then they would come up
and then when she--

20:23.348 --> 20:25.559
they came up, she'd be,
"Help me, help me."

20:25.726 --> 20:27.060
And then they'd take her down again.

20:27.227 --> 20:30.647
And she would be submerged for several seconds

20:30.814 --> 20:33.066
up to, I don't know, maybe a minute.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.943
You're not keeping track.

20:35.110 --> 20:40.657
So it was harder and harder
for her to get the air in

20:40.824 --> 20:42.159
because she was screaming.

20:42.326 --> 20:46.079
And my sister remembers
her saying, "I don't want to die."

20:47.289 --> 20:49.249
( exhales )

20:50.792 --> 20:54.630
Well, condolences to Keltie's family.

20:54.796 --> 20:56.673
Yeah.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.550
That we couldn't help her

20:58.717 --> 21:00.677
was pretty wretched.

21:01.929 --> 21:04.097
Sealand closed.
Well, it's probably a good thing.

21:04.264 --> 21:07.559
I mean, it was a little pond.

21:07.726 --> 21:09.561
And I think the owner,

21:09.728 --> 21:13.649
you know, made the right decision
for whatever reasons.

21:13.815 --> 21:16.360
I don't believe he's a bad guy, a bad man.

21:16.526 --> 21:18.654
I think he was shocked by the whole affair, too.

21:19.655 --> 21:21.615
The blush was gone from the business

21:21.782 --> 21:25.077
and he decided that that was it.

21:25.243 --> 21:26.411
We should shut down.

21:26.578 --> 21:29.414
No one ever contacted us.
There was an inquest.

21:29.581 --> 21:33.001
No one ever asked us to say what happened.

21:33.168 --> 21:35.212
- Yeah.
- You know, we just left.

21:35.379 --> 21:38.590
There was no big lawsuits afterwards
and there was no memorial.

21:38.757 --> 21:43.178
And the only thing remaining
of Keltie Byrne is--

21:43.345 --> 21:48.600
is what's left in the folks' minds
who recall the case.

21:48.767 --> 21:50.769
So in the newspaper articles,

21:50.936 --> 21:53.814
the cause of death
was that she drowned accidentally,

21:53.981 --> 21:57.192
but she was pulled under by the whale.

21:57.359 --> 21:59.444
Well, there's a bit of smoke
and mirrors going on.

21:59.611 --> 22:02.489
I mean, one of the fundamental facts is
is that none of the witnesses

22:02.656 --> 22:06.451
were clear about which whale pulled Keltie in.

22:06.618 --> 22:09.162
Yes. Yeah, it was the large whale.

22:09.329 --> 22:12.374
Tilikum, the male, is the one
that went after her.

22:12.541 --> 22:15.293
And the other two just kind of circled around.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.754
But he was definitely the instigator.

22:17.921 --> 22:22.175
And we knew it was that whale
because he had the flopped-over fin.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.845
Like, it was very easy to tell.

22:29.141 --> 22:33.061
Ventre: Sealand of the Pacific closed
its doors and was looking, I guess,

22:33.228 --> 22:34.521
to make a buck on the way out

22:34.688 --> 22:36.773
and these whales are worth millions of dollars.

22:36.940 --> 22:39.484
When SeaWorld heard that Tilikum was available

22:39.651 --> 22:42.988
after this accident at Sealand of the Pacific,

22:43.155 --> 22:45.699
they really wanted Tilikum
because they needed a breeder.

22:45.866 --> 22:48.243
So I don't even think that anybody
even was questioning,

22:48.410 --> 22:50.245
like, is this a good idea?

22:50.412 --> 22:54.082
My understanding of the situation
was that Tilikum and the others

22:54.249 --> 22:55.667
would not be used in shows.

22:55.834 --> 22:57.419
They would not be performance animals.

22:57.586 --> 22:58.920
Our understanding of their behavior

22:59.087 --> 23:01.715
was that it was such
a highly stimulating event for them

23:01.882 --> 23:03.300
that they were likely to repeat it.

23:03.467 --> 23:06.178
Sealand was-- we were all young
and bit of sea cowboys

23:06.344 --> 23:09.306
and we weren't so technical
and scientific as SeaWorld,

23:09.473 --> 23:11.767
so we all had this vision
that they knew more than us

23:11.933 --> 23:13.477
and they were better than us
and Tilikum would have

23:13.643 --> 23:15.187
a bigger pool and he'd have a better life

23:15.353 --> 23:17.439
and he would have better care
and he'd have better food

23:17.606 --> 23:19.649
and it'd be a great life for him.

23:19.816 --> 23:22.277
So it was like, "Okay, Tilly.

23:22.444 --> 23:25.697
You're going to Disneyland.
Lucky you."

23:27.741 --> 23:29.576

Narrator:
The orcas' intelligence

23:33.497 --> 23:35.832
may be even superior to man's.

23:35.999 --> 23:39.211
As parents, they are exemplary,
better than many human beings.

23:39.377 --> 23:43.590
And like human beings, they have
a profound instinct for vengeance.

23:50.764 --> 23:55.435
If you go back only 35 years, we knew nothing.

23:55.602 --> 23:56.853
In fact, less than nothing.

23:57.020 --> 23:59.981
What the public had was superstition and fear.

24:00.148 --> 24:02.275
Narrator:
A fight to the death...

24:03.902 --> 24:06.613
between the two most dangerous animals on Earth.

24:06.780 --> 24:08.323
What in hell are you?!

24:08.490 --> 24:10.367
Garrett: These were
the vicious killer whales

24:10.534 --> 24:12.786
that, you know, had 48 sharp teeth

24:12.953 --> 24:15.539
that would rip you to shreds
if they got a chance.

24:19.876 --> 24:23.713
What we learned is that
they're amazingly friendly

24:23.880 --> 24:27.551
and understanding and intuitively
want to be your companion.

24:27.717 --> 24:29.845
- ( Squeaking )
- Woman: Are you recording this?

24:30.011 --> 24:32.597
- ( Squeaking )
-( laughing )

24:32.764 --> 24:34.975
And to this day there is no record

24:35.142 --> 24:38.228
of an orca doing any harm
to any human in the wild.

24:51.783 --> 24:54.661
They live in these big families.

24:56.371 --> 24:59.416
And they have life spans
very similar to human life spans.

24:59.583 --> 25:03.253
The females can live to about 100, maybe more,

25:03.420 --> 25:05.922
males to about 50 or 60.

25:06.089 --> 25:10.177
But the adult offspring never leave
their mother's side.

25:10.343 --> 25:12.679
( Whistling )

25:12.846 --> 25:17.392
Each community has a completely
different set of behaviors.

25:17.559 --> 25:19.019
( Clicking )

25:19.186 --> 25:23.231
Each has a complete repertoire of vocalizations

25:23.398 --> 25:26.318
- with no overlap.
- ( whistling )

25:26.484 --> 25:27.861
You could call them languages.

25:28.028 --> 25:30.363
The scientific community is reluctant to say

25:30.530 --> 25:33.074
any other animal but humans uses languages,

25:33.241 --> 25:36.745
but there's every indication
that they use languages.

25:36.912 --> 25:40.207
The orca brain just screams out

25:40.373 --> 25:42.709
intelligence, awareness.

25:42.876 --> 25:44.544
We took this tremendous brain

25:44.711 --> 25:48.215
and we put it in a magnetic
resonance imaging scanner.

25:48.381 --> 25:52.302
What we found was just astounding.

25:52.469 --> 25:55.388
They've got a part of the brain
that humans don't have.

25:55.555 --> 25:58.975
A part of their brain has extended out

25:59.142 --> 26:01.937
right adjacent to their limbic system.

26:02.103 --> 26:04.856
The system processes emotions.

26:05.023 --> 26:08.109
The safest inference would be these are animals

26:08.276 --> 26:12.447
that have highly elaborated emotional lives.

26:12.614 --> 26:15.408
It's becoming clear that dolphins and whales

26:15.575 --> 26:18.912
have a sense of self, a sense of social bonding

26:19.079 --> 26:21.414
that they've taken to another level--

26:21.581 --> 26:24.084
much stronger, much more complex

26:24.251 --> 26:28.004
than in other mammals, including humans.

26:28.171 --> 26:30.382
We look at mass strandings,

26:30.548 --> 26:33.593
the fact that they stand by each other.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.888
Everything about them
is social-- everything.

26:37.889 --> 26:41.434
It's been suggested
that their whole sense of self

26:41.601 --> 26:44.980
is distributed among
the individuals in their group.

26:45.146 --> 26:46.940
Man:
There are five of them.

26:47.107 --> 26:51.027
These orca are going
to attack this seal on--

26:51.194 --> 26:55.907
they've been breaking the ice off
and swimming around him.

26:56.074 --> 26:57.826
Oh, here they come, two of them.
Lookit, underneath there.

26:57.993 --> 26:59.494
You can see them underneath.

26:59.661 --> 27:02.038
They made a big wave.
Look at that, a big wave.

27:02.205 --> 27:03.290
- Oh, yeah.
- Woman: Whoa.

27:03.456 --> 27:05.917
- Man #2: Oh, God.
- Woman #2: Oh, God. No, no, no.

27:06.084 --> 27:08.420
Oh!
Oh, I can't stand it.

27:08.586 --> 27:11.006
Man: If you can't watch
the bullfight, you'd better leave.

27:11.172 --> 27:13.925
Oh, yeah, here they go.
Look at this-- three of them.

27:14.926 --> 27:15.927
Man #3:
Look at this. Look at this.

27:16.094 --> 27:17.804
Woman #2:
Oh, God. Oh, no!

27:17.971 --> 27:19.472
- Oh, God!
- Man: It's all over.

27:19.639 --> 27:21.641
Woman #3:
Nope, not quite.

27:21.808 --> 27:24.769
- Man: Yeah, it's all over.
-( people shouting )

27:24.936 --> 27:26.688
Man:
It's all over.

27:40.910 --> 27:44.414
Duff us: The First Nations people
and the old fishermen on the coast,

27:44.581 --> 27:47.167
they call them "blackfish."

27:47.334 --> 27:51.504
They're an animal that possesses
great spiritual power

27:51.671 --> 27:54.090
and they're not to be meddled with.

27:58.595 --> 28:00.764
I've spent a lot of time around killer whales

28:00.930 --> 28:02.474
and they're always in charge.

28:03.808 --> 28:06.519
I never get out of the boat,
I never mess with them.

28:08.438 --> 28:10.940
The speed and the power is quite amazing.

28:14.444 --> 28:16.780
( Boat engine revs )

28:18.490 --> 28:20.367
Rules are the same
as the pool hall--

28:20.533 --> 28:23.495
keep one foot on the floor at all times.

28:27.415 --> 28:29.918
Even after seeing them thousands of times...

28:34.839 --> 28:36.716
you see them and you still--
( gasps )

28:36.883 --> 28:38.635
you know, wake up.

28:40.553 --> 28:42.722
( Hydraulic machine whirs)

28:51.731 --> 28:54.192
He arrived, I think, in 1992.

28:54.359 --> 28:56.694
I was at Whale and Dolphin Stadium
when he arrived.

28:56.861 --> 29:01.116
And he's twice as large
as the next animal in the facility.

29:01.282 --> 29:02.283
Woman:
Yay!

29:02.450 --> 29:03.827
Man: The guy is right
at about 12,000 pounds.

29:03.993 --> 29:07.288
That's incredible.
He looks fantastic.

29:07.455 --> 29:09.582
When Tilikum arrived at SeaWorld,

29:09.749 --> 29:14.712
he was attacked viciously,
repeatedly by Katina and others.

29:14.879 --> 29:18.299
In the wild, it's a very matriarchal society.

29:18.466 --> 29:21.344
Male whales are kept at the perimeter.

29:21.511 --> 29:23.054
- ( Vocalizing )
- In captivity,

29:23.221 --> 29:27.392
the animals are squeezed
into very close proximity.

29:27.559 --> 29:29.686
Tilikum-- the poor guy
is so large,

29:29.853 --> 29:33.481
he couldn't get away
because he just is not as mobile

29:33.648 --> 29:36.484
relative to the smaller and more agile females.

29:36.651 --> 29:39.195
And where was he going to run?
There's no place to run.

29:39.362 --> 29:41.865
Berg: I think he spent
a lot of time in isolation.

29:42.031 --> 29:44.492
SeaWorld claims that, "Oh, no,
he's always in with the other--

29:44.659 --> 29:46.661
with the females," but from what I saw,

29:46.828 --> 29:49.456
he was mostly put with the females
for breeding purposes

29:49.622 --> 29:53.710
and he didn't spend a lot of time,
you know, with the other whales.

29:53.877 --> 29:57.338
It's for his own protection
that he gets beat up.

29:57.505 --> 29:59.674
And so by segregating him,

29:59.841 --> 30:04.804
it provides a physical barrier
so the females can't kick his butt.

30:04.971 --> 30:07.599
Tilikum is pretty much kept in the back,

30:07.765 --> 30:12.103
and then brought out at the very end
as, like, the big splash.

30:12.270 --> 30:13.688
( Instrumental music playing )

30:16.357 --> 30:19.235
He was always happy to see you in the morning.

30:19.402 --> 30:20.820
- Hi!
- There we go.

30:20.987 --> 30:23.072
- You're the boy.
- Look at his chompers.

30:23.239 --> 30:25.533
Ventre: Maybe because he was alone,
maybe because he was hungry,

30:25.700 --> 30:26.910
maybe because he just liked you--

30:27.076 --> 30:29.078
who knows what was going on in his head.

30:29.245 --> 30:31.414
- You want to whistle?
- ( Tilikum whistling )

30:31.581 --> 30:34.542
-( laughs )
- All right, so he can talk to us.

30:34.709 --> 30:36.169
- Yes.
- You don't say.

30:36.336 --> 30:37.670
He's precious.
Yes?

30:37.837 --> 30:39.047
That was really loud.
Terrific.

30:39.214 --> 30:41.299
( Sputters )

30:41.466 --> 30:43.301
- Come on, big boy.
- Show the pecs.

30:43.468 --> 30:45.803
Berg: He seemed to like to work.
He seemed to be interested.

30:45.970 --> 30:48.348
He seemed to want to learn new things.

30:48.515 --> 30:51.559
He seemed to be enjoying
working with the trainers.

30:53.394 --> 30:56.397
Jett:
He, for me, was a joy.

30:56.564 --> 30:58.274
He really responded to me and I--

30:58.441 --> 31:01.236
you know, every day I went to work,
I was happy to see Tilly.

31:01.402 --> 31:03.696
( Woman laughs )

31:03.863 --> 31:06.950
- Boop!
- ( woman #2 laughs ) That's cute.

31:09.244 --> 31:10.912
( laughs )

31:11.079 --> 31:13.289
You're being too cute.

31:13.456 --> 31:16.125
Berg: I never got the impression
of him while I was there

31:16.292 --> 31:19.379
that, oh, my God, he's the scary whale.

31:19.546 --> 31:20.547
Not at all.

31:20.713 --> 31:25.301
Maybe some of it's just our naiveté or whatever,

31:25.468 --> 31:28.012
you know, because we weren't given

31:28.179 --> 31:30.598
the full details of Keltie's situation.

31:30.765 --> 31:32.183
Woman: Turn around.
Smile, buddy.

31:32.350 --> 31:34.102
- Cheese.
- Woman: Yay!

31:34.269 --> 31:36.729
I was under the impression
that Tilikum had nothing to do

31:36.896 --> 31:39.190
with her death specifically,
that it was the female whales

31:39.357 --> 31:40.525
who were responsible for her death.

31:40.692 --> 31:43.528
What I found really odd at first
was the way they were acting

31:43.695 --> 31:45.530
around this whale and what they had told us

31:45.697 --> 31:47.907
seemed to me to be two different things.

31:48.074 --> 31:49.826
The first day he arrived, I remember

31:49.993 --> 31:52.662
one of the senior trainers
at SeaWorld, she--

31:52.829 --> 31:55.915
Tilikum was in a pool
and she was walking over a gate,

31:56.082 --> 31:58.710
and she had her wetsuit unzipped
and it was tied around her waist.

31:58.876 --> 32:00.920
And she was making cooing noises and going,

32:01.087 --> 32:02.714
"Hey, Tilikum,
what a cute little whale."

32:02.880 --> 32:05.633
And she was, like,
just kind of play-talking at him,

32:05.800 --> 32:09.429
and one of the supervisors said,
"Get her out of there!"

32:09.596 --> 32:11.931
And just screamed at her,
like, "Get her away from there,"

32:12.098 --> 32:14.058
like they were so worried
that something was going to happen.

32:14.225 --> 32:17.270
And I remember thinking,
"Why are you guys making

32:17.437 --> 32:20.189
such a big deal out of this
when he didn't actually kill her?"

32:20.356 --> 32:23.484
Well, clearly management thought
there was some reason

32:23.651 --> 32:25.445
to exercise caution around him.

32:25.612 --> 32:28.239
You know, clearly they knew more
than they were telling us.

32:28.406 --> 32:29.407
( Instrumental music playing )

32:29.574 --> 32:32.076
Ladies and gentlemen, the next two
behaviors you're going to be seeing,

32:32.243 --> 32:34.495
you can only see right here at SeaWorld.

32:35.496 --> 32:39.125
Berg: Jeff was out in the audience
filming one of the Shamu shows.

32:39.292 --> 32:40.543
It was a perfect show.

32:40.710 --> 32:41.961
All of the hot dog sequences,

32:42.128 --> 32:44.255
the water works sequences went off great.

32:47.050 --> 32:49.302
I was really excited just to be capturing this

32:49.469 --> 32:52.138
because it was kind of turning out
to be a great show.

32:55.433 --> 32:57.810
A show that's kind of complete--

32:57.977 --> 33:01.731
it doesn't-- it probably only happens
a few times a week.

33:03.358 --> 33:06.110
At the very end of the show,
Liz was working Tilikum

33:06.277 --> 33:08.363
and apparently Tilikum
lunged out of the water at her.

33:08.529 --> 33:11.783
And I had captured Tilikum
coming out of the water

33:11.949 --> 33:13.868
kind of turning sideways and appeared to me

33:14.035 --> 33:15.453
to try to grab Liz.

33:15.620 --> 33:17.622
And at that moment,

33:17.789 --> 33:19.916
the tape became unusable.

33:20.083 --> 33:23.336
I was just kind of basically instructed
to get rid of the tape.

33:23.503 --> 33:26.756
Wanting to kind of preserve the tape,
I actually used the editing equipment

33:26.923 --> 33:30.009
and snipped out
that little half-second or second

33:30.176 --> 33:32.178
when he did that and stitched it back together

33:32.345 --> 33:34.681
so it just kind of looked like
a glitch in the tape.

33:34.847 --> 33:36.808
And I'm like, "Look at this."
And it was like, "No.

33:36.974 --> 33:38.393
This is no longer usable."

33:38.559 --> 33:40.853
You know, and so we had to destroy the tape.

34:19.141 --> 34:21.436
Ventre: It's pretty outrageous
that SeaWorld would claim

34:21.601 --> 34:24.105
there was no expecting Tilikum
to come out of the water

34:24.272 --> 34:26.065
because they had witnessed him
coming out of the water,

34:26.232 --> 34:28.275
and it's written into his profile.

34:30.485 --> 34:32.487
He lunges at trainers.

34:36.324 --> 34:39.370
When we visit SeaWorld,
we tend to take advantage of the fact

34:39.536 --> 34:43.081
that Shamu has been provided
with a safe and comfortable habitat.

34:43.248 --> 34:45.168
And everything trained is an extension

34:45.333 --> 34:48.087
of the killer whale's natural behavior.

34:48.254 --> 34:51.424
I spewed out the party line during shows.

34:51.591 --> 34:53.342
I'm totally mortified now.

34:53.509 --> 34:57.388
There was like-- something like,
"Look at Namu.

34:57.555 --> 35:00.308
Namu's not doing that
because she has to."

35:00.475 --> 35:03.936
Namu is doing this because she really wants to.

35:04.103 --> 35:05.730
Oh, my gosh.

35:05.897 --> 35:07.982
Like, some of the things I'm embarrassed by,

35:08.149 --> 35:09.358
so embarrassed by.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.905
At the time, I think
I could have convinced myself

35:14.071 --> 35:17.408
that the relationships that we had
were built on something

35:17.575 --> 35:20.369
stronger than the fact
that I'm giving them fish.

35:20.536 --> 35:22.038
You know, I like to think that...

35:22.205 --> 35:23.956
( laughs )

35:24.123 --> 35:26.584
but I don't know that that's the truth.

35:27.919 --> 35:29.545
( Orca vocalizing )

35:29.712 --> 35:33.216
I had been there a while and I had seen
a few other things along the way

35:33.382 --> 35:36.719
that made me question why I was there

35:36.886 --> 35:38.554
and what we were doing with these animals.

35:42.225 --> 35:44.685
Narrator:
On November 4, 1988,

35:44.852 --> 35:47.271
a killer whale at SeaWorld

35:47.438 --> 35:50.900
gave the performance of a lifetime.

35:57.824 --> 36:00.451
Don't miss this small miracle.

36:00.618 --> 36:04.372
Come see our new Baby Shamu.

36:04.539 --> 36:06.582
Ray:
I know it was naive of me,

36:06.749 --> 36:08.543
but I thought that...

36:08.709 --> 36:10.878
( clears throat )

36:11.045 --> 36:13.214
it was our responsibility
to do as much as we could

36:13.381 --> 36:15.007
to keep their family units together

36:15.174 --> 36:17.927
since we knew that in the wild
that's what happens.

36:18.094 --> 36:20.346
♪ Yes, sir, that's our baby... ♪

36:20.513 --> 36:22.849
Ray: Kalina was
the first Baby Shamu.

36:23.015 --> 36:25.601
Narrator: Baby Shamu--
SeaWorld's newest star...

36:25.768 --> 36:30.189
She had become quite disruptive
and challenging her mom a little bit

36:30.356 --> 36:32.859
and disrupting some shows
and that kind of thing.

36:33.025 --> 36:34.902
♪ She's got the whole place jumpin' ♪

36:35.069 --> 36:38.281
♪ Shamu,
she's that baby whale. ♪

36:39.282 --> 36:41.117
It was decided by the higher-ups
that she would be moved

36:41.284 --> 36:44.161
to another park when she was
just four, four and a half years old.

36:44.328 --> 36:48.416
And that was news to us as trainers
that were working with her.

36:48.583 --> 36:51.168
To me, it had never crossed my mind

36:51.335 --> 36:55.089
that they might be moving the baby from her mom.

36:58.175 --> 37:01.846
The supervisors basically
was kind of mocking me,

37:02.013 --> 37:04.432
like, "Oh, you're saying, 'Poor Kalina,"'

37:04.599 --> 37:07.935
you know, "'what's she going to do
without her mommy?"'

37:08.102 --> 37:10.855
And, you know-- and that
of course just shut me up.

37:11.022 --> 37:12.356
( laughs )

37:12.523 --> 37:15.067
So, the night of the move,
we had to deploy the nets

37:15.234 --> 37:19.196
to separate them and get Kalina,
the baby, into the med pool.

37:19.363 --> 37:22.491
And Katina was generally a quiet whale.

37:22.658 --> 37:24.952
She was not an overly vocal whale.

37:25.119 --> 37:28.247
After, Kalina was removed from the scene

37:28.414 --> 37:31.292
and put on the truck and taken to the airport,

37:31.459 --> 37:33.961
and Katina, her mom, was left in the pool.

37:34.128 --> 37:37.715
She stayed in the corner of the pool,

37:37.882 --> 37:41.719
like, literally just shaking and screaming,

37:41.886 --> 37:42.970
screeching, crying.

37:43.137 --> 37:45.264
- ( Crying )
- Like, I had never seen her

37:45.431 --> 37:46.891
do anything like that.

37:47.058 --> 37:48.976
And the other females in the pool,

37:49.143 --> 37:50.519
maybe once or twice during the night

37:50.686 --> 37:52.355
they'd come out and check on her.

37:52.521 --> 37:55.983
And she'd screech and cry
and they would just run back.

37:58.152 --> 38:00.363
There was nothing that you could call that,

38:00.529 --> 38:03.532
watching it, besides grief.

38:05.117 --> 38:07.119
Those are not your whales.

38:07.286 --> 38:10.206
You know, you love them and you'll think,

38:10.373 --> 38:13.751
"I'm the one that touches them,
feeds them, keeps them alive,

38:13.918 --> 38:16.212
gives them the care
that they need."

38:16.379 --> 38:18.714
They're not your whales.

38:18.881 --> 38:20.007
They own them.

38:21.384 --> 38:23.761
Kasatka and Takara were very close.

38:23.928 --> 38:27.723
Kasatka was the mother, Takara's the calf.

38:27.890 --> 38:29.725
Takara was special to me.

38:30.851 --> 38:33.396
They were inseparable.

38:33.562 --> 38:36.148
When they separated Kasatka and Takara,

38:36.315 --> 38:38.192
it was to take Takara to Florida.

38:38.359 --> 38:42.738
Once Takara had already been
stretchered out of the pool,

38:42.905 --> 38:46.158
put on the truck, driven to the airport...

38:46.325 --> 38:47.702
( clicking, crying )

38:47.868 --> 38:51.330
Hargrove:
Kasatka continued to make vocals

38:51.497 --> 38:53.457
that had never been heard before.

38:53.624 --> 38:55.292
- ( Crying continues )
- They brought in

38:55.459 --> 38:58.671
the senior research scientists
to analyze the vocals.

38:58.838 --> 39:01.757
They were long-range vocals.

39:01.924 --> 39:04.385
- ( Crying )
- She was trying something

39:04.552 --> 39:08.639
that no one had even heard before
looking for Takara.

39:08.806 --> 39:10.349
That's heartbreaking.

39:10.516 --> 39:11.809
( Clicking, crying )

39:11.976 --> 39:14.270
How can anyone

39:14.437 --> 39:19.150
look at that and think
that that is morally acceptable?

39:19.316 --> 39:21.193
It's not.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.362
It is not okay.

39:25.322 --> 39:26.866
Woman:
Stand by, Dean.

39:27.033 --> 39:28.617
Richard:
Let's go live to SeaWorld

39:28.784 --> 39:31.454
where Dean Gomersall
is joining us for a sneak peek.

39:31.620 --> 39:33.622
Hi, Dean.
Tell us about the new show.

39:33.789 --> 39:34.999
Good afternoon, Richard.

39:35.166 --> 39:36.876
The new show is the Whale and Dolphin Discovery.

39:37.043 --> 39:39.170
What it does is it shows
the relationship we have

39:39.336 --> 39:41.297
between all our animals here at the Whale...

39:41.464 --> 39:43.674
There's so many things that were told to us

39:43.841 --> 39:45.968
that they tell us-- they tell you
so many times

39:46.135 --> 39:47.553
that you just--
you start believing it.

39:47.720 --> 39:49.430
So all the animals here get along very well.

39:49.597 --> 39:51.390
It's just like training your dog, really.

39:51.557 --> 39:53.976
I was blind, you know.
I was a kid.

39:54.143 --> 39:56.645
I didn't know what I was doing, really.

39:56.812 --> 39:58.105

40:10.034 --> 40:12.578
Go ahead and wave at everyone, David.

40:12.745 --> 40:15.581
Berg: I just really bought into
what they told us.

40:15.748 --> 40:18.709
You know, I learned to say
what they told us to the audience.

40:18.876 --> 40:19.877
Hello out there.

40:20.044 --> 40:22.046
Children are some of Shamu's biggest fans.

40:22.213 --> 40:24.048
We can do just about anything we want.

40:24.215 --> 40:26.675
I thought I knew everything about
killer whales when I worked there,

40:26.842 --> 40:28.302
you know, and everything about these animals.

40:28.469 --> 40:30.096
I really know nothing about killer whales.

40:30.262 --> 40:32.389
I know a lot about being an animal trainer

40:32.556 --> 40:34.266
or a killer whale trainer,
but I don't know anything

40:34.433 --> 40:37.144
about these animals' natural history
or their behavior.

40:37.311 --> 40:40.272
I really in some ways believed a lot
of what I was learning from them,

40:40.439 --> 40:41.816
because why would they lie?

40:41.982 --> 40:47.613
Because the whales in their pools die young,

40:47.780 --> 40:52.660
they like to say that all orcas
die at 25 or 30 years.

40:52.827 --> 40:55.412
- 25 to 35 years.
- 25 to 35 years.

40:55.579 --> 40:58.958
They're documented in the wild
living to be about...

40:59.125 --> 41:00.876
35, mid-30s.

41:01.043 --> 41:03.003
They tend to live a lot longer
in this environment

41:03.170 --> 41:04.630
because they have all the veterinary care.

41:04.797 --> 41:06.423
Garrett:
And of course that's false.

41:06.590 --> 41:10.928
We knew by 1980, after half a dozen
years of the research,

41:11.095 --> 41:14.682
that they live equivalent to human life spans.

41:14.849 --> 41:19.061
And every other potentially
embarrassing fact is twisted

41:19.228 --> 41:21.605
and turned and denied one way or another.

41:21.772 --> 41:23.107
Woman:
So, in the wild, they live...

41:23.274 --> 41:24.441
- Less.
- Less.

41:24.608 --> 41:26.360
Like the floppy dorsal fins.

41:26.527 --> 41:30.322
25% of whales have a fin
that turns over like that

41:30.489 --> 41:31.657
as they get older.

41:31.824 --> 41:35.828
Dorsal collapse happens
in less than 1% of wild killer whales.

41:35.995 --> 41:36.996
We know this.

41:37.163 --> 41:42.126
All the captive males
100% have collapsed dorsal fins.

41:42.293 --> 41:45.754
And they say that they're a family,
that the whales are in their family.

41:45.921 --> 41:47.339
They have their pods.

41:47.506 --> 41:51.969
But that's just an artificial
assemblage of their collection,

41:52.136 --> 41:55.347
however management decides they should mix them

41:55.514 --> 41:57.683
and whichever ones happen to be born

41:57.850 --> 41:59.852
or bought and brought in.

42:00.019 --> 42:02.605
That's not a family, you know.

42:24.668 --> 42:26.962
that are not part of their culture

I think it was 1988.

Kandu, trying to assert
her dominance over Corky,

43:41.787 --> 43:43.580

It fractured her jaw,
which cut an artery in her head

43:52.089 --> 43:55.259
Now that's got to be a hard way to go down.

43:57.303 --> 44:00.639
I saw that there was just
a lot of things that weren't right.

44:11.108 --> 44:12.985
to take care of the animals that were there.

44:13.152 --> 44:15.779
You know, I think all the trainers there
have the same thing in their heart.

They're trying to make a difference
in the lives of the animals.

to the nuts and bolts of it,

44:29.251 --> 44:31.545
I stayed because I felt sorry for Tilikum.

44:31.712 --> 44:35.591
And I couldn't bring myself to stop coming

44:58.447 --> 45:00.908
and have people walk away loving this animal?

45:01.075 --> 45:02.493
And they're touched and they're moved

45:02.659 --> 45:05.371
and I feel like I made a difference to them.

45:05.537 --> 45:07.998
I left in January of 2010,

45:08.165 --> 45:10.709
a month before Dawn passed away.

45:11.710 --> 45:14.296
She was like a safety guru.

45:14.463 --> 45:17.007
I mean, she was always
double-checking,

45:17.174 --> 45:18.842
making sure that everyone
was doing the right thing.

45:19.009 --> 45:21.512
So I remember she would record
every show that she did

45:21.678 --> 45:24.223
and she would watch it and critique herself.

45:24.390 --> 45:27.643
She was constantly trying to be better.

45:27.810 --> 45:29.812
When I found out it was Dawn,

45:29.978 --> 45:32.231
I was shocked.

45:33.273 --> 45:35.692
That could have been me.
I could have been the spotter.

45:35.859 --> 45:37.986
What if I was there and I could have saved her?

45:38.153 --> 45:40.739
You know, all these things go through your mind.

45:52.751 --> 45:54.837
Berg: John Sillick
is the guy who, in 1987,

45:55.003 --> 45:58.298
was crushed between two whales
at SeaWorld of San Diego.

45:58.465 --> 46:01.677
Now, even though I'd been working
at SeaWorld for six months,

46:01.844 --> 46:03.595
I had no idea that that had even happened.

46:03.762 --> 46:05.013
I never even heard that story.

46:05.180 --> 46:08.434
And the SeaWorld party line was that,
well, that was-- it was a trainer error.

46:08.600 --> 46:10.477
It was John's fault.
You know, John's fault.

46:10.644 --> 46:12.187
He was supposed to get off that whale.

46:12.354 --> 46:15.107
And for years, I believed that
and I told people that.

46:23.157 --> 46:26.743
I actually started at SeaWorld, like,
five days after that event occurred

46:26.910 --> 46:29.788
and we didn't--
we weren't told much about it

46:29.955 --> 46:33.083
other than it was trainer error.

46:33.250 --> 46:36.336
And, you know, especially
when you're new into the program,

46:36.503 --> 46:37.754
you don't really question a whole lot.

46:37.921 --> 46:40.007
Well, you know, years later,
when you actually look at the footage,

46:40.174 --> 46:42.134
you go, "You know what?
He didn't do anything wrong."

46:42.301 --> 46:43.719
That whale just landed on him, you know.

46:43.886 --> 46:46.180
That whale just went to the wrong spot.

46:46.346 --> 46:47.890
It could have been aggression.
Who knows?

46:48.056 --> 46:51.059
But it was not the trainer's fault
at all, watching that video.

46:55.772 --> 46:59.151
When I saw the video
of the killer whale landing on John,

46:59.318 --> 47:00.861
I mean, it just absolutely took my breath away.

47:02.196 --> 47:03.238
I watched it two or three times,

47:03.405 --> 47:04.823
and every time I saw that, I just gasped.

47:04.990 --> 47:06.408
I could not believe what I was seeing.

47:06.575 --> 47:08.368
What kept his body together is--

47:08.535 --> 47:10.412
his wetsuit basically held him together.

47:10.579 --> 47:11.955
But I know he's had multiple surgeries

47:12.122 --> 47:14.249
and he's got tons of hardware in his body.

47:14.416 --> 47:17.419
And it's hard for me to believe
that I didn't actually see that video

47:17.586 --> 47:19.796
while I was actually an animal trainer

47:19.963 --> 47:22.007
because it seems to me that every person

47:22.174 --> 47:24.593
who works with killer whales
should have to watch that video.

47:24.760 --> 47:25.886
( VCR clicks )

47:29.431 --> 47:31.642
Harg rove:
Tamarie--

47:31.808 --> 47:33.894
you know, Tamarie made mistakes.

47:34.061 --> 47:37.231
The most important one
was interacting with whales

47:37.397 --> 47:39.233
without a spotter.

47:40.651 --> 47:43.362
So she's putting her foot on Orkid,

47:43.529 --> 47:44.988
she's taking her foot off.

47:45.155 --> 47:48.659
She's putting her foot on Orkid,
her rostrum, she's taking it off.

47:48.825 --> 47:51.411
Watching the video, knowing Orkid,

47:51.578 --> 47:55.123
your stomach drops because you know
what's probably going to happen.

47:56.250 --> 47:57.668
She grabbed her foot.

47:57.834 --> 48:01.004
Tamarie whips around and she grabs the gate.

48:01.171 --> 48:03.840
You see herjust ripped from the gate.

48:05.968 --> 48:08.428
At this point, Tamarie knows
that she's in trouble.

48:08.595 --> 48:09.888
She's under the water.

48:10.055 --> 48:12.057
Splash and Orkid both have her.

48:12.224 --> 48:13.892
She's totally out of view.

48:14.059 --> 48:16.603
No other trainer knows that this is happening.

48:16.770 --> 48:18.021
People start to scream.

48:18.188 --> 48:21.316
It was a park guest that was filming it.

48:21.483 --> 48:23.235
You hear-- you don't see her,

48:23.402 --> 48:26.905
but you hear Tamarie surface.

48:27.072 --> 48:30.576
You hear herjust scream out,
"Somebody help me."

48:30.742 --> 48:33.161
And the way she screamed it,

48:33.328 --> 48:34.830
it was just
such a bloodcurdling--

48:34.997 --> 48:38.083
like she knew she was going to die.

48:39.585 --> 48:42.838
Robin-- when he ran over,
he made a brilliant decision.

48:43.005 --> 48:46.383
He told a trainer to run and take
the chain off Kasatka's gate.

48:47.509 --> 48:50.178
By taking that chain off,
it would give the precursor to Orkid

48:50.345 --> 48:51.930
that Kasatka was coming in.

48:52.097 --> 48:55.017
Kasatka's more dominant than Orkid,

48:55.183 --> 48:58.061
so Orkid let her go.

48:58.228 --> 49:02.482
Her arm, it was U-shaped.

49:02.649 --> 49:04.860
It was compound fractured.

49:06.903 --> 49:10.115
She's very lucky to be alive, that's for sure.

49:23.503 --> 49:26.214
Berg: I believe it's 70 plus,
maybe even more,

49:26.381 --> 49:28.884
just killer whale trainer accidents.

49:29.051 --> 49:33.388
Maybe 30 of them happened prior to me
being actually hired at SeaWorld.

49:33.555 --> 49:34.848
And I knew about none of them.

49:38.977 --> 49:41.772
Ventre: I've seen animals
come out at trainers.

49:46.693 --> 49:48.236
Man:
Something's wrong.

49:48.403 --> 49:49.905
I've seen people get slammed.

50:02.876 --> 50:06.797
The whales, they're just playing or--
or they're upset for a second.

50:15.722 --> 50:17.849
It was just something that happened, you know?

50:18.016 --> 50:20.519
Jett: This culture of
"You get back on the horse

50:20.686 --> 50:22.396
and you dive back in the water.

50:22.562 --> 50:25.440
And if you're hurt, well, then we've got
other people that will replace you."

50:25.607 --> 50:28.026
And, "You came a long way.
Are you sure you want that?"

50:37.661 --> 50:39.788
Meredith Vieira: A SeaWorld trainer
is recovering today

50:39.955 --> 50:43.375
after a terrifying ordeal
in front of a horrified audience.

50:43.542 --> 50:45.544
( Instrumental music playing )

51:09.443 --> 51:12.988
Duff us: For some reason,
the whale just took a different approach

51:13.155 --> 51:14.948
to what it was going to do

51:15.115 --> 51:18.410
with a very senior,
very experienced trainer, Ken Peters,

51:18.577 --> 51:20.287
and dragged him to the bottom of the pool

51:20.454 --> 51:22.080
and held him at the bottom.

51:23.915 --> 51:26.251
Let him go, picked him up,

51:26.418 --> 51:27.836
took him down again.

51:34.885 --> 51:39.556
And these periods he was taken down
were pretty close to the mark.

51:39.723 --> 51:43.518
You know, a minute, a minute 20.

51:48.064 --> 51:50.192
When he was at the surface, he didn't panic,

51:50.358 --> 51:52.027
he didn't thrash, he didn't scream.

51:52.194 --> 51:53.987
Maybe he's just built that way.

51:54.154 --> 51:56.865
But he stroked the whale.

52:00.994 --> 52:03.830
And the whale let go of one foot
and grabbed the other.

52:22.390 --> 52:25.769
That's a pretty deep pool
and he took him right down.

52:25.936 --> 52:28.396
I think that's to two atmospheres of pressure.

52:28.563 --> 52:31.691
Apparently, Mr. Peters
is an experienced scuba diver

52:31.858 --> 52:33.443
and I think that knowledge probably contributed

52:33.610 --> 52:35.529
to how he was able to be hauled down there

52:35.695 --> 52:38.865
that quickly and stay calm and know what to do.

52:41.284 --> 52:44.287
He knew what he was doing because
you can see him actually in the film.

52:44.454 --> 52:46.122
It's-- the def is so good,
you can see him ventilating.

52:46.289 --> 52:47.958
You can see him ventilating really hard.

52:48.124 --> 52:51.211
So he knows about swimming
and diving and being underwater.

52:51.378 --> 52:54.673
He may have been assuming
he was going under again.

52:54.840 --> 52:59.511
I did not walk away unimpressed
by his calm demeanor

52:59.678 --> 53:01.471
during that whole affair.

53:04.891 --> 53:06.852
I would be scared shitless.

53:25.287 --> 53:27.289
He was near to the end.

53:29.165 --> 53:33.712
Presumably, Ken Peters
had a relationship with this whale.

53:33.879 --> 53:36.381
Maybe he did.
Maybe that's what saved him.

53:36.548 --> 53:40.385
But Peters got the whale to let him go.

53:41.761 --> 53:43.305
And they strung a net across.

53:51.938 --> 53:56.484
And Ken Peters pulled himself
over the float line

53:56.651 --> 53:59.571
and swam like a demon
to a slide-out

53:59.738 --> 54:02.449
because the whale was coming right behind him.

54:02.616 --> 54:04.951
The whale jumped over and came right after him.

54:05.118 --> 54:06.328
He tried to stand up and run.

54:06.494 --> 54:07.579
Of course, his feet were damaged.

54:07.746 --> 54:10.749
I mean, he just fell and he scrambled.

54:13.043 --> 54:14.920
And they take this as a prime example

54:15.086 --> 54:16.671
of their training working.

54:16.838 --> 54:20.634
And they say, "Just stand back
and stay calm," and that did work.

54:21.676 --> 54:25.263
They claim this as a victory

54:25.430 --> 54:27.390
of how they do business.

54:32.479 --> 54:35.774
And maybe so, but it can also be interpreted

54:35.941 --> 54:39.486
as a hair's breadth away from another fatality.

54:46.284 --> 54:48.078
All: Hi, Shamu.
Hi, everybody.

54:48.244 --> 54:50.622
We're the Johnsons from Detroit, Michigan.

54:50.789 --> 54:52.666
We sure had a great time
when we visited SeaWorld.

54:52.832 --> 54:54.250
It's one of our favorite places.

54:54.417 --> 54:57.671
Yeah, I like the part when Shamu
gets everybody wet.

54:57.837 --> 54:59.965
When the whales get close to the glass

55:00.131 --> 55:01.591
and start kicking out the water?

55:01.758 --> 55:03.343
Whamo!
You're a goner.

55:03.510 --> 55:04.511
( Instrumental music playing )

55:04.678 --> 55:07.138
( crowd screaming )

55:13.228 --> 55:17.232
Orange County's sheriff's deputies
have identified the 27-year-old man

55:17.399 --> 55:20.235
found dead in a killer whale's tank at SeaWorld.

55:20.402 --> 55:24.155
The victim is Daniel P. Dukes
from South Carolina.

55:24.322 --> 55:27.158
Dukes was found yesterday
draped over the back of Tilikum,

55:27.325 --> 55:30.161
the largest orca held in captivity.

55:30.328 --> 55:33.456
Well, all I know is
the public relations version of it--

55:33.623 --> 55:36.501
he was a young man that had been arrested

55:36.668 --> 55:39.295
not long before he snuck into SeaWorld.

55:39.462 --> 55:41.131
Maybe he climbed the barbed wire fence

55:41.297 --> 55:44.509
around the perimeter and stayed after hours.

55:44.676 --> 55:48.138
Perfect story line--
a mentally disturbed guy

55:48.304 --> 55:51.141
hides in the park after hours
and strips his clothes off

55:51.307 --> 55:54.394
and decides he wants to have
a magical experience with an orca

55:54.561 --> 55:57.439
and drowns because he became hypothermic.

55:57.605 --> 55:59.482
Right.
So that's the story line

55:59.649 --> 56:01.443
and none of us were there
to know the difference.

56:01.609 --> 56:05.155
He was not detected by the night watch trainers

56:05.321 --> 56:07.365
who were presumably at that station.

56:07.532 --> 56:09.367
There are cameras all over SeaWorld.

56:09.534 --> 56:11.786
There are cameras all over
the back of Shamu Stadium

56:11.953 --> 56:12.954
pointing every which way.

56:13.121 --> 56:15.206
There are underwater cameras.

56:15.373 --> 56:19.252
I find it hard to believe
that nobody knew until the morning

56:19.419 --> 56:21.254
that there was a body in there.

56:21.421 --> 56:24.049
They have a night watch trainer every night.

56:24.215 --> 56:27.218
That person didn't hear
any splashing or screaming?

56:27.385 --> 56:30.722
I mean, I just find that really suspicious.

56:30.889 --> 56:32.182
One of the employees--

56:32.348 --> 56:34.267
I don't know if it was
a physical therapist or somebody--

56:34.434 --> 56:38.688
was coming in in the morning
and there was Tilikum,

56:38.855 --> 56:41.608
you know, with a dead guy,
a dead, naked guy on his back,

56:41.775 --> 56:45.820
kind of parading him around the back pool.

56:45.987 --> 56:48.615
The public relations spin on this was that

56:48.782 --> 56:52.327
he was kind of a drifter
and died of hypothermia.

56:52.494 --> 56:56.164
But the medical examiner reports

56:56.331 --> 56:58.333
were more graphic than that.

56:58.500 --> 57:01.127
For example, Tilikum stripped him,

57:01.294 --> 57:02.796
bit off his genitals.

57:02.962 --> 57:05.381
There was bite marks all over his body.

57:05.548 --> 57:09.469
Now, whether that was post-death
or pre-death, I don't know.

57:09.636 --> 57:12.263
But, yeah, all I can comment on

57:12.430 --> 57:15.391
is that the guy definitely
jumped in the wrong pool.

57:22.649 --> 57:25.276
So why keep Tilikum there?

57:25.443 --> 57:28.154
This guy, he has a proven
track record of killing people.

57:28.321 --> 57:31.074
He's clearly a liability to the institution.

57:31.241 --> 57:34.160
Why keep him around?
Well, it's quite simple to answer.

57:34.327 --> 57:36.663
And that is that his semen
is worth a lot of money.

57:46.422 --> 57:48.299
Berg: Over the years,
Tilikum has been

57:48.466 --> 57:51.177
one of the main breeding whales at SeaWorld.

57:54.931 --> 57:57.934
It's brilliant because they can
inseminate way more female whales,

57:58.101 --> 58:00.103
because they can just
get his sperm and freeze it.

58:00.270 --> 58:02.313
And then he's basically
operating as a sperm bank.

58:04.107 --> 58:06.401
In a reputable breeding program, rule number one

58:06.568 --> 58:09.362
is you certainly would not breed
an animal that has shown

58:09.529 --> 58:12.198
a history of aggression towards humans.

58:12.365 --> 58:15.368
Imagine if you had a pit bull who had killed.

58:15.535 --> 58:17.537
That animal would have likely been put down.

58:17.704 --> 58:19.581
But in the entire
SeaWorld collection--

58:19.747 --> 58:23.126
it's like 54% of the whales
in SeaWorld's collection

58:23.293 --> 58:26.004
now have Tilikum's genes.

58:32.969 --> 58:35.972
( Applause )

58:39.225 --> 58:42.061
The fall is to assume that
all killer whales are like Tilikum.

58:42.228 --> 58:44.189
You have to look at their
learning history from birth.

58:44.355 --> 58:47.817
You have to understand why Tilikum was a hazard

58:47.984 --> 58:49.569
to anybody in the water.

58:49.736 --> 58:52.947
And you have to understand that none
of the other killer whales at SeaWorld

58:53.114 --> 58:54.365
that are in that system are that way.

58:54.532 --> 58:56.993
Interviewer: What about
the incident at Loro Parque?

58:57.160 --> 58:58.620
First of all, I-- I can't--

58:58.786 --> 59:02.832
I can't speak with specificity
about Loro Parque.

59:02.999 --> 59:04.918
I wasn't there.

59:05.084 --> 59:07.295
In fact, I know very little about it.

59:07.462 --> 59:09.923
Probably about as much
as the general public knows.

59:32.320 --> 59:35.490
( Speaking Spanish )

59:42.872 --> 59:43.873
( laughs )

01:00:13.152 --> 01:00:15.613
Suzanne Allee: Loro Parque,
it's in the Canary Islands,

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:17.907
which is an autonomous region of Spain.

01:00:18.074 --> 01:00:21.119
It's the largest tourist attraction
in all of Spain.

01:00:21.286 --> 01:00:24.998
( Speaking Spanish )

01:00:26.666 --> 01:00:29.669
Allee: And when SeaWorld
sent the orcas to Loro Parque,

01:00:29.836 --> 01:00:32.255
everybody was always questioning,

01:00:32.422 --> 01:00:37.427
like, how did they make
that leap to send four young orcas

01:00:37.593 --> 01:00:40.555
to a park off the west coast of Africa

01:00:40.722 --> 01:00:45.435
with trainers who-- a lot of them
had never been around orcas before?

01:00:47.562 --> 01:00:49.314
Nothing was ready.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:50.857
The venue wasn't ready.

01:00:51.024 --> 01:00:54.485
It wasn't ready for the orcas,
it wasn't ready for a show.

01:00:54.652 --> 01:00:57.155
The owner of the park
didn't want to lose revenue

01:00:57.322 --> 01:00:59.782
by shutting down the pools and repairing them.

01:00:59.949 --> 01:01:01.951
So for three years, the animals ate the pools

01:01:02.118 --> 01:01:04.120
and for three years
the animals had problems--

01:01:04.287 --> 01:01:06.956
with their teeth, with their stomachs.

01:01:07.123 --> 01:01:08.583
So that's the reason why these animals

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:10.793
are enduring the endoscope procedures.

01:01:12.378 --> 01:01:14.213
Back up.
Now back up, back up.

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:16.257
Allee: Those are still
SeaWorld's animals

01:01:16.424 --> 01:01:18.718
and they are responsible for those animals.

01:01:18.885 --> 01:01:21.888
( Orca crying )

01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:28.478
( orca clicking, crying )

01:01:28.644 --> 01:01:31.439
Loro Parque doesn't have a good reputation.

01:01:31.606 --> 01:01:35.318
People that work in the business
know the reputation of places

01:01:35.485 --> 01:01:38.571
and Loro Parque does not have a good reputation.

01:01:38.738 --> 01:01:41.866
They didn't spend the same amount
of time as the SeaWorld trainers,

01:01:42.033 --> 01:01:43.951
did not go through the same regimen

01:01:44.118 --> 01:01:46.913
that the SeaWorld trainers went through.

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.707
You know, and Alexis really was
the best trainer.

01:01:49.874 --> 01:01:52.877
And I did say-- I said,
"You're the only trainer there

01:01:53.044 --> 01:01:56.422
that can hold his own
with a SeaWorld trainer."

01:01:56.589 --> 01:01:58.925
And I said, "But you need
to be careful."

01:02:08.684 --> 01:02:10.311
( Rodriguez speaking Spanish )

01:02:32.708 --> 01:02:34.544
Anywhere along the line
it could have been stopped

01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:37.296
because everyone knew
it was a tragedy waiting to happen.

01:02:37.463 --> 01:02:40.007
But no one ever did anything about it.

01:02:40.174 --> 01:02:41.509
And in the end,

01:02:41.676 --> 01:02:44.595
it was the best trainer who lost his life.

01:02:44.762 --> 01:02:46.848
( Speaking Spanish )

01:03:00.403 --> 01:03:03.531
( Speaking Spanish )

01:03:41.777 --> 01:03:43.362
( exhales )

01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:04.944
Duff us:
Those were SeaWorld's whales.

01:05:05.111 --> 01:05:07.488
They were trained using SeaWorld's techniques.

01:05:08.573 --> 01:05:12.868
And their training was being supervised
at the time of the fatal accident

01:05:13.035 --> 01:05:17.123
by one of their senior trainers from San Diego.

01:05:39.103 --> 01:05:42.398
Duff us: For somebody to get up
and say in a court of law

01:05:42.565 --> 01:05:45.985
they have no knowledge of the linkages

01:05:46.152 --> 01:05:50.197
between SeaWorld
and this park in Tenerife is well--

01:05:50.364 --> 01:05:53.576
either she doesn't know and is telling the truth

01:05:53.743 --> 01:05:55.995
or it's just a bold-faced lie.

01:06:00.333 --> 01:06:03.336
As trainers, we never forget
Shamu's true potential.

01:06:03.502 --> 01:06:05.296
We see it each and every day.

01:06:05.463 --> 01:06:09.175
That's why all of our interactions
are very carefully thought out,

01:06:09.342 --> 01:06:11.427
especially our water work interaction.

01:06:11.594 --> 01:06:13.095
Whoa!

01:06:18.142 --> 01:06:19.393
( laughing )

01:06:20.728 --> 01:06:22.938
You big dork.

01:06:23.105 --> 01:06:25.066
Especially our water work interactions

01:06:25.232 --> 01:06:27.943
because they're potentially the most dangerous.

01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:31.739
I'd been expecting it
since the second person was killed.

01:06:31.906 --> 01:06:35.117
I'd been expecting somebody
to be killed by Tilikum.

01:06:35.284 --> 01:06:36.911
I'm surprised it took as long as it did.

01:06:37.078 --> 01:06:39.121
Reporter: First tonight,
a six-ton killer whale

01:06:39.288 --> 01:06:41.957
has lived up to its name,
killing an experienced trainer

01:06:42.124 --> 01:06:44.251
at SeaWorld, Orlando, today.

01:06:44.418 --> 01:06:45.878
Reporter #2:
A tourist at an earlier show

01:06:46.045 --> 01:06:47.880
said the animal seemed agitated.

01:06:48.047 --> 01:06:51.175
Reporter: Trainers complained
the whales weren't cooperating.

01:06:51.342 --> 01:06:53.469
The whole show, the main show,

01:06:53.636 --> 01:06:55.513
was a disaster that day.

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.848
There was, you know, whales chasing each other

01:06:58.015 --> 01:07:00.351
and eventually the trainers decided
that they had to stop the show

01:07:00.518 --> 01:07:02.353
because they couldn't
get the whales under control.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.730
Tilikum was in the back pool

01:07:04.897 --> 01:07:09.735
set up to do a Dine with Shamu
performance with Dawn.

01:07:09.902 --> 01:07:13.322
Likely she saw what had gone on
during the main show

01:07:13.489 --> 01:07:17.034
and so she had probably felt
more pressure to do a good show.

01:07:18.828 --> 01:07:20.663
Yay!

01:07:20.830 --> 01:07:22.790
Berg: When you watch
the whole video, you can see

01:07:22.957 --> 01:07:25.626
that Tilikum is actually really with Dawn

01:07:25.793 --> 01:07:27.545
in the beginning of the video.

01:07:27.712 --> 01:07:29.922
( Applause )

01:07:30.089 --> 01:07:32.717
There's a couple of behaviors
that she asks him to do

01:07:32.883 --> 01:07:34.844
where Tilikum justjumps right in

01:07:35.010 --> 01:07:37.388
and he does exactly what she asks him to do.

01:07:43.644 --> 01:07:45.521
Ventre: There seemed to be
a point in the session

01:07:45.688 --> 01:07:47.982
where things went south, so to speak.

01:07:48.149 --> 01:07:49.692
And in my humble opinion,

01:07:49.859 --> 01:07:53.320
it was at that missed bridge--
whistle bridge,

01:07:53.487 --> 01:07:55.364
on the perimeter pec wave.

01:07:55.531 --> 01:07:58.075
She asked him to do a perimeter pec wave

01:07:58.242 --> 01:08:01.954
where she asked him to basically
go all the way around the pool

01:08:02.121 --> 01:08:03.706
and wave his pectoral flipper.

01:08:06.083 --> 01:08:08.961
- And she blows her whistle...
- ( whistle blows )

01:08:09.128 --> 01:08:10.629
- Announcer: There we go.
- ...which is a bridge,

01:08:10.796 --> 01:08:12.840
which tells the animal that, okay,
you've done a good job.

01:08:13.007 --> 01:08:14.133
Come back and get food.

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:16.010
But he missed that cue.

01:08:17.219 --> 01:08:19.555
Announcer: He likes waving so much.
That's beyond waving.

01:08:19.721 --> 01:08:21.890
Berg: And he went
all the way around the pool

01:08:22.057 --> 01:08:23.850
on this perimeter pec wave.

01:08:24.018 --> 01:08:25.935
Announcer: That's all right.
We're going to let him keep on waving.

01:08:27.354 --> 01:08:29.689
My interpretation is that
he didn't hear the whistle.

01:08:29.857 --> 01:08:32.318
Berg: So not only
did he not hear the bridge,

01:08:32.484 --> 01:08:34.987
then he went and did
a perfect behavior and came back,

01:08:35.154 --> 01:08:38.698
and what he got was what we call
a three-second neutral response,

01:08:38.866 --> 01:08:40.242
which is just a way to let the animal know,

01:08:40.408 --> 01:08:41.827
"No, you didn't do the correct thing.

01:08:41.993 --> 01:08:44.287
You're not going to get rewarded.
And then we're going to move on."

01:08:44.455 --> 01:08:45.831
And then you can also see through the video

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:48.000
that Dawn is running out of food.

01:08:49.126 --> 01:08:50.669
Ventre:
The animals can sense

01:08:50.836 --> 01:08:52.962
when you're getting to the bottom
of your bucket of fish,

01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:55.341
because they can hear the ice clanging around

01:08:55.508 --> 01:08:57.968
and the kind of fishy, soupy water
at the bottom.

01:08:58.135 --> 01:09:01.721
And the handfuls of fish that
they're getting delivered by the trainer

01:09:01.889 --> 01:09:03.182
are all getting smaller.

01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:06.352
So they know that they're coming down
to the end of session.

01:09:06.519 --> 01:09:08.813
Berg: When you see the difference
between the beginning of the video

01:09:08.979 --> 01:09:10.606
and the end of the video, you can see

01:09:10.773 --> 01:09:14.193
that he's just not quite on his game anymore.

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:15.486
There was no food left.

01:09:15.653 --> 01:09:18.447
She kept asking him for more and more behaviors.

01:09:18.613 --> 01:09:20.323
He wasn't getting reinforced for the behaviors

01:09:20.491 --> 01:09:21.617
that he was doing correctly.

01:09:21.783 --> 01:09:24.828
He probably was frustrated towards the end.

01:09:26.622 --> 01:09:29.959
Ventre: Then she walked around
the perimeter of G pool.

01:09:30.125 --> 01:09:31.836
He followed her.

01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:39.969
And then continued over
into the rocky ledge area

01:09:40.135 --> 01:09:44.430
where she laid down with him
to do a relationship session,

01:09:44.598 --> 01:09:47.518
which is--
it's quiet time, basically.

01:09:47.685 --> 01:09:50.395
Jett: Tilikum at some point
grabbed ahold of her left forearm

01:09:50.563 --> 01:09:53.314
and started to drag her
and eventually did a barrel roll

01:09:53.482 --> 01:09:55.109
and pulled her in.

01:09:55.276 --> 01:09:58.070
It may have started as play or frustration

01:09:58.237 --> 01:10:02.783
and clearly escalated to be
very violent behavior

01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:05.494
that I think was anything but play.

01:10:05.661 --> 01:10:07.997
In the end, he basically

01:10:08.163 --> 01:10:10.374
just completely mutilated that poor girl.

01:10:13.586 --> 01:10:17.756
Hargrove: They were gathering
all of the trainers at the Texas park.

01:10:17.923 --> 01:10:22.052
He said, "There's been an accident

01:10:22.219 --> 01:10:25.180
at the Florida park
and a trainer was killed."

01:10:26.181 --> 01:10:29.435
Hearing that it was Dawn,
I was-- I couldn't believe it.

01:10:29.602 --> 01:10:31.604
I just remember saying to myself, "Not Dawn.

01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:33.397
It can't be Dawn."

01:10:33.564 --> 01:10:37.943
He said that--
"And he still has her."

01:10:38.110 --> 01:10:40.863
And I just...

01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:43.157
was so disturbed by that

01:10:43.324 --> 01:10:47.620
and the reality of how powerless we are.

01:10:47.786 --> 01:10:51.123
Duff us: Avulsion, laceration,
abrasion, fractures.

01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:53.792
Fractures and associated hemorrhages.

01:10:53.959 --> 01:10:56.545
Blunt force traumas

01:10:56.712 --> 01:10:59.048
to the main body, to the extremities.

01:11:00.257 --> 01:11:03.761
To see this meted out against a trainer...

01:11:03.928 --> 01:11:06.722
and I cannot fathom the reason.

01:11:06.889 --> 01:11:09.141
It's shocking.

01:11:09.308 --> 01:11:13.145
The lawyer for OSHA asked me
what I thought we'd learned,

01:11:13.312 --> 01:11:14.980
and I'm sitting in the courtroom

01:11:15.147 --> 01:11:19.109
and I've got the Keltie Byrne
case file in one hand

01:11:19.276 --> 01:11:21.028
and I've got Dawn Brancheau in the other.

01:11:21.195 --> 01:11:23.155
And they're almost, to the day, 20 years apart.

01:11:23.322 --> 01:11:25.199
And I'm looking at these two things.

01:11:25.366 --> 01:11:27.868
My only answer is, "Nothing."

01:11:28.035 --> 01:11:30.079
In fact, it's not a damn thing.

01:11:30.245 --> 01:11:31.497
We have not learned a damn thing

01:11:31.664 --> 01:11:34.583
for something like that
to happen 20 years apart.

01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:37.544
Reporter: Could you tell
if it was an accident or if this--

01:11:37.711 --> 01:11:39.838
Reporter #2: Did this female trainer
work with this whale on a regular basis?

01:11:40.005 --> 01:11:43.384
I don't know. What apparently happened
is we had a female trainer

01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:45.135
back in the whale holding area.

01:11:45.302 --> 01:11:47.596
She apparently slipped or fell into the tank

01:11:47.763 --> 01:11:50.140
and was fatally injured by one of the whales.

01:11:50.307 --> 01:11:52.601
At first, SeaWorld reported
that a trainer slipped

01:11:52.768 --> 01:11:55.145
and fell in the water and was drowned.

01:11:55.312 --> 01:11:56.814
So that was the first report.

01:11:56.981 --> 01:11:59.441
It wasn't until eyewitness
accounts disputed that

01:11:59.608 --> 01:12:00.859
that they had to go back in their huddle

01:12:01.026 --> 01:12:02.778
and say, "Wait a minute.
We gotta come up with a new plan."

01:12:02.945 --> 01:12:04.488
Reporter: New tonight--
SeaWorld has confirmed

01:12:04.655 --> 01:12:07.241
the killer whale pulled
the woman into the water.

01:12:07.408 --> 01:12:08.951
She didn't fall into the tank

01:12:09.118 --> 01:12:11.578
as the sheriff's department initially reported.

01:12:11.745 --> 01:12:14.873
The new plan is that he grabbed her ponytail.

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:18.794
This is a subtle way of placing
the blame on Dawn's shoulders.

01:12:18.961 --> 01:12:20.754
She shouldn't have had a long ponytail,

01:12:20.921 --> 01:12:23.507
or if she did have that ponytail,
it should have been up in a bun.

01:12:23.674 --> 01:12:25.926
Dawn, if she was standing here
with me right now,

01:12:26.093 --> 01:12:29.430
would tell you that it was her mistake

01:12:29.596 --> 01:12:31.348
in allowing that to happen.

01:12:31.515 --> 01:12:33.517
Hargrove:
They blamed her.

01:12:33.684 --> 01:12:35.686
How dare you?

01:12:35.853 --> 01:12:39.606
How disrespectful for you to blame her

01:12:39.773 --> 01:12:43.110
when she's not even alive to defend herself.

01:12:43.277 --> 01:12:45.487
He grabbed her ponytail
and pulled her into the water.

01:12:45.654 --> 01:12:47.114
That's as simple as it gets.

01:12:47.281 --> 01:12:49.366
Berg: There are photographs
of plenty of other trainers

01:12:49.533 --> 01:12:51.326
doing exactly the same thing that she was doing,

01:12:51.493 --> 01:12:55.873
so I knew that SeaWorld was lying
about the fact that this was her fault.

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:59.752
The ponytail, in all likelihood, is just a tale.

01:13:01.211 --> 01:13:04.965
The safety spotter, who apparently
didn't actually see the takedown,

01:13:05.132 --> 01:13:06.133
came up with that.

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:08.927
- Are you excited?
- Crowd: Yeah!

01:13:09.094 --> 01:13:10.763
Dave McDaniel:
During the spotter's testimony,

01:13:10.929 --> 01:13:13.807
OSHA pushed him to say
that he wasn't really sure

01:13:13.974 --> 01:13:16.268
that it was her ponytail
that was in the whale's mouth,

01:13:16.435 --> 01:13:20.189
that he just saw her underwater
and he assumed it was the ponytail.

01:13:20.355 --> 01:13:22.316
OSHA contends that the whale came up

01:13:22.483 --> 01:13:24.193
and grabbed Dawn Brancheau's arm,

01:13:24.359 --> 01:13:26.320
saying that that was another level
of aggressiveness.

01:13:26.487 --> 01:13:29.490
And again, SeaWorld is saying
it was not an aggressive move.

01:13:29.656 --> 01:13:31.784
One of SeaWorld's top curators, Chuck Tompkins,

01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:34.078
said when Dawn Brancheau
was pulled off that ledge,

01:13:34.244 --> 01:13:37.289
it wasn't necessarily
aggressive behavior by the whale.

01:13:37.456 --> 01:13:41.043
The initial grab was not an act of aggression.

01:13:41.210 --> 01:13:43.420
This is not a crazed animal.

01:13:43.587 --> 01:13:45.798
The industry has a vested interest
in spinning these

01:13:45.964 --> 01:13:48.425
so that the animals continue to appear

01:13:48.592 --> 01:13:51.970
like cuddly teddy bears
that are completely safe.

01:13:52.137 --> 01:13:53.972
You know, that sells a lot of Shamu dolls,

01:13:54.139 --> 01:13:58.143
it sells a lot of tickets at the gate,
and that's the story line

01:13:58.310 --> 01:14:01.355
that they're going to continue
to stick with for as long as they can.

01:14:19.206 --> 01:14:23.836
Recognize that those that say
this is a crazed animal

01:14:24.002 --> 01:14:27.005
that acted out and grabbed Dawn maliciously,

01:14:27.172 --> 01:14:32.553
they want to prove the theorem
that captivity makes animals crazy.

01:14:32.719 --> 01:14:34.346
And that is just false.

01:14:34.513 --> 01:14:36.932
All whales in captivity have a bad life.

01:14:37.099 --> 01:14:38.767
They're all emotionally destroyed.

01:14:38.934 --> 01:14:41.854
They're all psychologically traumatized,

01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:44.690
so they are ticking time bombs.

01:14:44.857 --> 01:14:46.233
It's not just Tilikum.

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.819
We have to separate
what happened to Dawn--

01:14:48.986 --> 01:14:52.114
and, as tragic as it is, no one wants
to ever see it happen again.

01:14:52.281 --> 01:14:54.491
Can SeaWorld create an environment

01:14:54.658 --> 01:14:55.951
where it never happens again?

01:14:56.118 --> 01:14:58.162
Yes, I absolutely believe they can.

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:03.709
What if there were no SeaWorlds?

01:15:03.876 --> 01:15:07.087
I can't imagine a society, with the value we put

01:15:07.254 --> 01:15:09.798
on marine mammals, if those parks didn't exist.

01:15:09.965 --> 01:15:13.635
I'm not at all interested in having my daughter,

01:15:13.802 --> 01:15:15.387
who is three and a half,

01:15:15.554 --> 01:15:18.348
grow up thinking that it's normalized

01:15:18.515 --> 01:15:21.393
to have these intelligent,
highly evolved animals

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:22.728
in concrete pools.

01:15:22.895 --> 01:15:25.439
I don't want her to think
that's how we treat the kin

01:15:25.606 --> 01:15:28.525
that we find ourselves around on this planet.

01:15:28.692 --> 01:15:30.194
I think it's atrocious.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.945
This hearing is expected to last all week

01:15:32.112 --> 01:15:34.990
with OSHA continuing to work
toward this theory--

01:15:35.157 --> 01:15:38.660
that SeaWorld knew there was
a calculated risk of injury or death,

01:15:38.827 --> 01:15:41.788
but put trainers in the water
with the whales anyway,

01:15:41.955 --> 01:15:44.082
while SeaWorld will say
that Dawn Brancheau's death

01:15:44.249 --> 01:15:46.001
was an isolated incident.

01:15:46.168 --> 01:15:49.129
Reporting live in Seminole County,
Dave McDaniel, WESH 2 News.

01:15:59.223 --> 01:16:00.224
There's something wrong.

01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:05.395
You know with Tilikum that
there's something wrong and that's--

01:16:05.562 --> 01:16:08.732
when you have a relationship
with that animal and you--

01:16:10.192 --> 01:16:14.571
you understand that he's killing
not to be a savage.

01:16:14.738 --> 01:16:17.407
He's not killing because he's just crazy.

01:16:17.574 --> 01:16:20.410
He's not killing because
he doesn't know what he's doing.

01:16:20.577 --> 01:16:22.246
He's killing because he's frustrated

01:16:22.412 --> 01:16:28.001
and he's got aggravations
and he doesn't know how to--

01:16:28.168 --> 01:16:30.295
he has no outlet for it.

01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:34.091
Jett: Now Tilikum is spending
a great deal of time by himself

01:16:34.258 --> 01:16:38.095
and basically floating lifeless in a pool.

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:42.057
Woman:
Three hours now...

01:16:42.224 --> 01:16:44.184
and he hasn't moved.

01:16:45.394 --> 01:16:47.104
They try to sugarcoat it by saying,

01:16:47.271 --> 01:16:48.855
"He comes out in the front pool
every once in a while.

01:16:49.022 --> 01:16:50.315
Now he's doing shows."

01:16:50.482 --> 01:16:51.483
Really? You know
what he does in a show?

01:16:51.650 --> 01:16:52.901
( Applause )

01:16:53.068 --> 01:16:54.778
He does a few bows

01:16:54.945 --> 01:16:58.490
and then he goes back in his little jail cell.

01:16:58.657 --> 01:16:59.950
That's his life.

01:17:00.117 --> 01:17:01.868
( Applause )

01:17:02.035 --> 01:17:04.204
Duff us:
I feel sad for Tilikum.

01:17:04.371 --> 01:17:07.416
A regal thing like him swimming around the tank

01:17:07.582 --> 01:17:09.376
with his fin flopped over like that

01:17:09.543 --> 01:17:12.587
compared to a wild bull killer whale that size,

01:17:12.754 --> 01:17:15.257
which is one of the most kinetic
and dynamic things

01:17:15.424 --> 01:17:16.967
you can imagine...

01:17:19.428 --> 01:17:21.763
I feel sad when I see him.

01:17:28.312 --> 01:17:30.063
Berg:
It's time to stop the shows.

01:17:30.230 --> 01:17:32.566
It's time to stop forcing animals to perform

01:17:32.733 --> 01:17:34.484
in basically a circus environment.

01:17:34.651 --> 01:17:36.570
And they should release the animals
that are young enough

01:17:36.737 --> 01:17:39.656
and healthy enough to be released,
and the animals like Tilikum

01:17:39.823 --> 01:17:42.617
who are old and sick and have put in
25 years in the industry

01:17:42.784 --> 01:17:44.202
should be released to an open ocean pen

01:17:44.369 --> 01:17:45.579
so they can live out their lives

01:17:45.746 --> 01:17:47.748
and just experience
the natural rhythms of the ocean.

01:17:47.914 --> 01:17:49.708
This is a multibillion-dollar
corporation

01:17:49.875 --> 01:17:53.712
that makes its money
through the exploitation of orcas.

01:17:53.879 --> 01:17:56.214
They're not suitable to have in captivity.

01:17:56.381 --> 01:17:58.592
The whales are really bored.

01:17:58.759 --> 01:18:03.013
You deprive them of all
this environmental stimulation.

01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:05.140
Gomersall:
I think that in 50 years,

01:18:05.307 --> 01:18:08.101
we'll look back and go,
"My God, what a barbaric time."

01:18:48.892 --> 01:18:51.520
Dawn Brancheau--
DB, dream big.

01:18:52.521 --> 01:18:56.066
Dawn was the most loving,
giving person you ever met.

01:18:56.233 --> 01:18:59.486
Her smile just radiated.

01:19:08.203 --> 01:19:10.831
She's comp-- she fulfilled her life.

01:19:59.254 --> 01:20:00.922
Ventre:
We saw whales

01:20:01.089 --> 01:20:04.843
swimming in straight lines
with straight dorsal fins.

01:20:06.219 --> 01:20:08.680
I was so honored to be there.

01:20:14.144 --> 01:20:16.563
And I was so thankful that I had sunglasses on

01:20:16.730 --> 01:20:19.983
because the tears were kind of coming out.

01:20:20.150 --> 01:20:22.819
And it was moving.

01:20:23.904 --> 01:20:26.907
