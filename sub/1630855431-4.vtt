00:09.843 --> 00:11.720
Superman is a liar.

00:11.720 --> 00:15.682
He dodged every question
I asked him, Clark.
I have nothing.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.100
This isn't an article.

00:17.100 --> 00:21.229
It's a,...It's a dead end. Ugh!

00:21.229 --> 00:25.483
Seriously, who is Superman?

00:25.483 --> 00:27.902
Well, maybe he's a nice guy
who has powers

00:27.902 --> 00:31.030
and just wants to use them
to help as many people
as he can.

00:31.030 --> 00:33.783
Clark, if you had powers,
you'd do that.

00:33.783 --> 00:36.286
But I'm not talking
about you.

00:36.286 --> 00:38.371
No.
We need another angle.

00:38.371 --> 00:39.831
Bam! Got it!

00:41.541 --> 00:44.919
"UFO Sighting?"
"Miracles in the Heartland?"

00:44.919 --> 00:46.212
What is this?

00:46.212 --> 00:47.255
Oh, you know, nothing.

00:47.255 --> 00:48.798
Lois asked for them.

00:48.798 --> 00:51.426
We're going to track down
Superman by reading tabloids!

00:51.426 --> 00:56.055
There's nothing
about Superman online
or in any reputable papers.

00:56.055 --> 01:00.685
- So maybe Jimmy is--
- What was that?

01:00.685 --> 01:02.896
Couldn't quite hear
the last part.

01:02.896 --> 01:07.609
Ugh, you might be right,
but since no one normal
believes in aliens,

01:07.609 --> 01:09.819
the truth will be in these.

01:09.819 --> 01:11.613
We're so close.

01:11.613 --> 01:16.159
Together we can do this.
Together we will--

01:16.159 --> 01:18.077
Come upstairs with me.

01:43.102 --> 01:46.439
Easy. You're not in trouble
for being
in the newspaper morgue.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.525
Now, shut up.
I'm about to be nice.

01:50.360 --> 01:54.280
You keep telling me you want
to be reporters,
loudly, repeatedly.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.659
So tonight, I'm going
to give you your shot.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.702
Dr. Ivo, CEO of Amazo Tech.

01:59.702 --> 02:04.082
As in, Amazo phones, computers,
security and anything else
you can think of.

02:04.082 --> 02:07.210
And the man who used
his criminal connections
to displace

02:07.210 --> 02:08.878
a whole neighborhood
for his headquarters.

02:08.878 --> 02:11.047
Not to mention the accidents
that always seem

02:11.047 --> 02:12.966
to hit his competitors.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.885
But no one has been able
to verify those rumors,
and we work in facts.

02:15.885 --> 02:19.055
Fact is, he's the most
eligible bachelor in the city.

02:19.055 --> 02:21.891
So Cat's writing
an interest piece on him.

02:21.891 --> 02:24.060
He's throwing a gala
for his investors tonight

02:24.060 --> 02:26.479
and Cat wants you three
to get pictures of the event,

02:26.479 --> 02:28.606
and quotes about Ivo
from the people attending.

02:28.606 --> 02:30.149
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

02:30.149 --> 02:33.528
Are you saying you want us to
to do real journalism?

02:33.528 --> 02:36.531
- Just for tonight.
- Our first assignment
from the chief!

02:36.531 --> 02:39.409
Don't call me chief,
and it's just for tonight.

02:39.409 --> 02:40.660
Anything you want, Chief.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.078
Yes!

02:42.078 --> 02:45.039
Don't make me
regret this. And dress up!

02:45.039 --> 02:46.124
It's black tie.

02:46.124 --> 02:47.417
Oh, and Lane...

02:49.085 --> 02:50.128
Impress me.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.553
Hey there.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.930
Oh, uh, hi, Jimmy.
Have you...
Have you seen Lois?

03:00.930 --> 03:02.932
Not yet.
But look at what I've got.

03:02.932 --> 03:05.351
The <i>Planet's</i> entire
camera room, huh?

03:05.351 --> 03:09.439
Okay, ha-ha, Clark,
But, seriously,
I need every one.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.149
This is a fish-eye lens.

03:11.149 --> 03:14.193
And I might have to get
a picture of the whole place.

03:17.655 --> 03:19.449
And this one
is to block out the sun.

03:19.449 --> 03:20.783
And I know
what you're thinking.

03:20.783 --> 03:22.619
When would we need a UV light?

03:22.619 --> 03:25.580
But when wouldn't we need
the coolest light?

03:25.580 --> 03:26.664
What do you think?

03:30.752 --> 03:32.211
Wow.

03:34.589 --> 03:38.259
Ready to go
to the most exclusive high rise
in all of Metropolis?

03:38.259 --> 03:43.514
- And spend the entire night
together?
- Almost like a... A...

03:43.514 --> 03:46.351
An awesome evening
with three best friends.

03:55.860 --> 03:56.986
Wow.

03:56.986 --> 03:58.655
There's the refreshment table.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.574
I'm going to go grab plate
of canape, and then let's go!

04:01.574 --> 04:03.201
All right. Cat prepared
questions for us,

04:03.201 --> 04:06.162
so I can take half
and you'll throw them away.

04:06.162 --> 04:07.872
Okay. Why?

04:07.872 --> 04:10.541
There is the CEO
of Galaxy Communications.

04:10.541 --> 04:13.586
There is Mayor Fleming,
and there is her opponent.

04:13.586 --> 04:17.131
We are with the most powerful
and corrupt people in the city.

04:17.131 --> 04:21.761
There's no way I'm asking
about Metropolis'
most eligible bachelor.

04:21.761 --> 04:25.264
"Do you have a comment
on your recent bribery
charges?"

04:25.264 --> 04:27.141
"Where did the campaign
money go?"

04:27.141 --> 04:29.602
Lois, please.
You're going to get
us thrown out.

04:29.602 --> 04:32.230
You heard Perry.
He wants us to impress him.

04:32.230 --> 04:34.941
This is our ticket
to more real work.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.818
Look, I don't think
that's what he mea--

04:38.194 --> 04:40.863
Okay? I grabbed anything
that said it contained gold.

04:41.906 --> 04:45.743
Where... Where did you go?

04:45.743 --> 04:47.870
Senator Sackett! Lois Lane,
the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

04:47.870 --> 04:50.707
Do you have a comment
on the allegations
that your re-election campaign

04:50.707 --> 04:52.834
- is taking bribes
from special interest groups?
- Ugh.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.712
Sir? Senator!

04:55.712 --> 04:57.255
A moment of... Sir!

04:59.966 --> 05:02.468
- There you are.
- Oh, a photographer.

05:02.468 --> 05:05.346
Thank goodness.
The old fraternity gang
is here,

05:05.346 --> 05:08.224
and Omega Pi
needs a picture, stat.

05:08.224 --> 05:09.767
- Come, chum.
- Wait, what...

05:09.767 --> 05:11.310
Lois Lane, <i>Daily Planet.</i>

05:11.310 --> 05:12.895
If you have a moment,
I'd like to ask you...

05:12.895 --> 05:14.564
Excuse me!

05:14.564 --> 05:15.565
Excuse me.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.066
Clark Kent. <i>Daily Planet.</i>

05:17.066 --> 05:21.320
Are you aware of corruption?

05:21.320 --> 05:23.406
I think I'm on the wrong card.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.368
Oh, and my granddaughter.

05:27.368 --> 05:29.245
It's her debut this weekend.

05:29.245 --> 05:31.497
Sir, I'm here
for the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

05:31.497 --> 05:32.915
Ooh!

05:32.915 --> 05:35.251
Then we'll be on
the front page, undoubtably.

05:35.251 --> 05:40.298
Oh, I'm sorry.
Can we get a picture
with your fish-eye lens?

05:40.298 --> 05:43.676
Yes, I also have a UV light.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.053
Ooh.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.680
Excuse me, Lois Lane, <i>Daily...</i>

05:47.680 --> 05:50.850
Ma'am, for the <i>Daily Planet.</i>
Can you comment on...

05:58.858 --> 06:01.444
Thanks, Smallville.

06:01.444 --> 06:04.614
Lois, maybe we should go back
to Cat's questions?

06:04.614 --> 06:08.743
No. We have a golden
opportunity here
to write a story that matters.

06:08.743 --> 06:11.454
And we will... one day.

06:11.454 --> 06:14.123
But for now, we should stick
to the assignment.

06:14.123 --> 06:16.459
You don't understand.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.795
Lois.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.755
I'm going to go back
to Ms. Grant's cards

06:20.755 --> 06:23.508
and I'll take the next person
who comes in.

06:23.508 --> 06:24.467
Okay?

06:27.512 --> 06:32.225
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, you know him
as the founder of Amazo Tech.</i>

06:32.225 --> 06:38.147
<i>The boy genius who, at 21,
disrupted the way we interact
with technology.</i>

06:38.147 --> 06:42.902
<i>A leader, a humanitarian
and your host.</i>

06:42.902 --> 06:44.862
Put your hands together

06:44.862 --> 06:50.493
for... [drum roll] Dr. Ivo!

06:50.493 --> 06:54.831
Oh, oh, oh, what?
Oh, hey, that's me!

07:00.711 --> 07:02.505
Thank you. Thank you.
You're welcome. Thank you.

07:02.505 --> 07:05.174
Oh, and what a spread, huh?

07:05.174 --> 07:07.802
Okay, my assistant Alex
went all out,

07:07.802 --> 07:11.472
so a round of applause
for the little people.

07:11.472 --> 07:15.726
Alex, Alex, Alex.
Now, I want you to take
a moment.

07:15.726 --> 07:19.021
Look to your left.
Look to your right.

07:19.021 --> 07:21.357
Remember these faces.

07:21.357 --> 07:26.487
Because these are the people
that you'll witness
history with,

07:26.487 --> 07:29.532
as we reveal the latest
from Amazo Tech.

07:29.532 --> 07:33.244
Until then, enjoy the canapes,
snack some of those lamb chops,

07:33.244 --> 07:37.707
and get your phones ready
to record.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.959
Ah. [grunts] Boom!

07:39.959 --> 07:41.502
Nailed it.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.880
Well, sure, that, obviously,
put that on the Tube,

07:43.880 --> 07:48.426
but also what I'm about
to unveil.

07:48.426 --> 07:49.927
Thank you.

07:49.927 --> 07:52.346
- Thank you.
- Oh, yeah.
This one's all yours.

07:53.764 --> 07:56.475
Welcome in advance.
Curtis, my man.

07:56.475 --> 07:58.060
You know what?
Glad you're here.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.812
The board is meeting
for the vote tonight, Anthony.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.898
They won't be held
off any longer.

08:03.107 --> 08:04.358
Let's talk over here.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.154
Yeah, that is not
what we agreed on.

08:08.154 --> 08:11.199
- The tech I'm about to debut--
- Won't change anything.

08:11.199 --> 08:13.910
The latest profit numbers
are nonexistent, Tony.

08:13.910 --> 08:17.496
Yeah, you can't vote me out
of my own company, okay?

08:17.496 --> 08:20.791
- I am Amazo Tech.
- And you're broke.

08:20.791 --> 08:22.043
So listen to me.

08:22.043 --> 08:25.004
No, no, no, no, no.
You listen to me.

08:25.004 --> 08:28.633
There will be a grand unveiling
of our newest product.

08:28.633 --> 08:35.765
It will redefine humanity
and all the money problems
will go away.

08:35.765 --> 08:40.269
So, why don't you go ahead
and keep the board happy
until the end of the night?

08:40.269 --> 08:44.273
Dr. Ivo,
Clark Kent
with the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

08:44.273 --> 08:47.485
Excuse me.
What? Wow.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.779
I didn't realize
reporters came in this size.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.113
What are you, a linebacker?

08:51.113 --> 08:53.199
Think fast. Ow!

08:53.199 --> 08:54.075
Wow!

08:54.075 --> 08:55.660
Ouch.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.787
Oh.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.665
I know who you are.

09:00.665 --> 09:03.292
- Uh...
- You're from Cat, right?

09:03.292 --> 09:05.795
Aw, love that little lady.

09:07.588 --> 09:10.424
But between you and me,
I'd much rather talk
<i>mano a mano.</i>

09:10.424 --> 09:14.595
How about this.
I'll give you the juicy deets
for that bachelor article,

09:14.595 --> 09:19.308
and if you forget anything
you might have overheard
between me and Curtis,

09:19.308 --> 09:24.563
we can introduce you
to the gala's finer bachelorettes.

09:24.563 --> 09:27.316
Huh? Little quid bro quo.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.319
Oh, no. Well, not her.

09:30.319 --> 09:31.654
Gross, ugh, gag.

09:31.654 --> 09:34.865
No, I meant
a classy gal, you know?

09:34.865 --> 09:36.909
What do you say, buddy? Hmm?

09:36.909 --> 09:40.496
Well, I'd say your company displaced
an entire neighborhood

09:40.496 --> 09:44.000
in a real estate deal
connected to the
Gazzo crime family.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.002
Is that what you'd like
to focus on?

09:46.002 --> 09:48.671
Or perhaps you want to comment
on the investigation
into the fires

09:48.671 --> 09:50.298
that took down
your other competitors?

09:50.298 --> 09:54.218
Because I'd love to talk
about that, <i>mano a mano.</i>

09:56.762 --> 09:59.682
This kid! Oh!

09:59.682 --> 10:01.684
I love it. I love it.
You're great.

10:01.684 --> 10:05.187
Hey, you know what?
Let's just escort you
to the press section.

10:05.187 --> 10:06.856
Shall we?

10:12.194 --> 10:14.989
Hi, Lois.

10:14.989 --> 10:20.161
- Uh, sorry. I just got, uh--
- Oh, I don't know if I should
let you back in.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.871
I mean, you don't follow
the cards,

10:21.871 --> 10:23.789
you don't stick
to the assignment.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.625
And I don't
even meet the
dress code anymore.

10:26.625 --> 10:27.626
That we can fix.

10:27.626 --> 10:28.878
Take it off.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.046
Wha... What?

10:30.046 --> 10:31.881
The jacket, bad boy.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.174
Wha... What?

10:35.718 --> 10:39.513
I've ripped enough blazers
running after stories
that I'm always prepared.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.737
Wow. Uh...

10:54.737 --> 10:57.573
Uh, so this seems old,
a high school jacket?

10:57.573 --> 11:00.993
Chess club,
I never played sports.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.253
It's my dad.

11:11.253 --> 11:13.464
Oh, you can take it
if you need to.

11:13.464 --> 11:14.590
No, no, it's fine.

11:15.424 --> 11:16.717
Um...

11:16.717 --> 11:19.303
My dad and I,
we don't talk.

11:19.303 --> 11:23.265
My whole life, he's kept things
to his chest.

11:23.265 --> 11:26.852
His job, where we were moving
next when I was a kid.

11:27.895 --> 11:30.940
How sick Mom really was.

11:30.940 --> 11:34.568
And even before she passed,
he wasn't someone you went
to with your problems.

11:34.568 --> 11:35.903
He...

11:35.903 --> 11:37.446
He doesn't want to hear
about my screwups.

11:37.446 --> 11:40.074
Wait, what? Lois, what are you
talking about?

11:40.074 --> 11:43.285
Clark, It's been a year
and I'm still an intern.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.913
I couldn't even get anyone
to talk to me tonight.

11:47.706 --> 11:50.584
I became a reporter
to do work that matters.

11:50.584 --> 11:54.713
- But every time I tried--
- Lois, since I started
this job,

11:54.713 --> 11:59.760
you have almost gotten
me fired, frozen
and smashed by robots.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.804
Clark, do they not teach you
how to comfort people

12:01.804 --> 12:03.347
in Kansas?

12:03.347 --> 12:05.683
But if it weren't for you,
I'd still be making coffee,

12:05.683 --> 12:07.768
dreaming of a chance
to do more.

12:07.768 --> 12:10.896
You've changed my life
for the better, Lois,

12:11.897 --> 12:13.816
in every possible way.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.277
Thank you.

12:16.277 --> 12:19.238
I've been feeling off lately,
and this means...

12:20.698 --> 12:21.532
a lot.

12:24.034 --> 12:28.622
Actually, there's something
I've been wanting to say.
Something I...

12:28.622 --> 12:30.666
I need to tell you.

12:30.666 --> 12:33.919
- Lois, I'm--
- And it's all Superman's fault.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.005
I know that guy
is hiding something,

12:36.005 --> 12:38.424
and I hate being lied to,
you know?

12:38.424 --> 12:40.259
It's throwing me off. Ugh!

12:40.259 --> 12:41.677
Sorry, you were going to say?

12:41.677 --> 12:42.803
I, uh...

12:43.512 --> 12:44.513
Nothing.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.140
Huh?

12:52.813 --> 12:54.732
Lois!

12:57.443 --> 12:58.777
Locked.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.741
- Uh, looks like
it was just stuck.
- Ha!

13:09.288 --> 13:13.834
Lois, this is the same kind
of stolen tech Intergang had,
and Livewire.

13:13.834 --> 13:14.877
What are those?

13:17.046 --> 13:21.717
Alex, if you
make me late, so help me,
I will ruin your life.

13:21.717 --> 13:24.803
But it's still a prototype.
And short-term wear

13:24.803 --> 13:26.889
- caused out-of-control
aggression in the test groups.
- Aah!

13:26.889 --> 13:31.310
Oh, my God, at what point
did this seem like
a conversation, Alex?

13:31.310 --> 13:33.437
When you started
talking to me.

13:35.064 --> 13:38.067
The board's against me,
the baby reporter
humiliated me.

13:38.067 --> 13:41.654
But with this,
I'll shut everybody up.

13:41.654 --> 13:42.780
Now!

13:47.076 --> 13:53.415
Ladies and gentlemen,
the time has come
for you to see the future.

13:53.415 --> 13:57.294
I present the Parasite 1.0.

14:04.635 --> 14:07.429
We live in dangerous times.

14:07.429 --> 14:11.433
Metropolis was the safest city
in America.

14:11.433 --> 14:16.063
Now we're in the midst
of a crime wave
like nothing before.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.525
And then there's Superman,

14:19.525 --> 14:22.736
a guy who claims
he just wants to help.

14:22.736 --> 14:27.616
But can we really trust
a stranger to help us for free?

14:27.616 --> 14:29.285
Of course we can't.

14:29.285 --> 14:33.122
The only person you can trust
is yourself.

14:33.122 --> 14:40.170
And now, with the Parasite,
you can become
your own Superman.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.923
But don't take my word for it.

14:42.923 --> 14:45.342
Let's get a volunteer.

14:45.342 --> 14:49.972
How about... you?

15:05.946 --> 15:07.156
Lois!

15:07.156 --> 15:08.532
Where's Clark?
I thought he was with you.

15:08.532 --> 15:10.492
What do you mean?
He's right here.

15:10.492 --> 15:11.452
Clark?

15:13.787 --> 15:15.080
We're trapped.

15:17.833 --> 15:19.918
This is taking too long.

15:19.918 --> 15:21.879
Let's speed things up.

15:30.971 --> 15:32.264
- Huh?
- Hello.

15:33.390 --> 15:34.683
There you are.

15:38.854 --> 15:41.106
Dr. Ivo. I don't know
what's going on here,

15:41.106 --> 15:43.192
but you need
to let these people go.

15:43.192 --> 15:47.488
Whoa! What? And lose
my audience right when
the main attraction arrives?

15:47.488 --> 15:51.617
Buddy, I don't think
you understand sales. Alex!

15:51.617 --> 15:52.618
Now!

15:58.999 --> 16:05.381
That's right, folks.
Our pal Superman is gonna help
with our demonstration.

16:07.633 --> 16:11.929
You see, the Parasite 1.0
gives me strength,

16:11.929 --> 16:14.098
speed and durability

16:14.098 --> 16:15.557
equal to his.

16:23.857 --> 16:27.403
And if he tries to fight back,
the suit absorbs

16:27.403 --> 16:29.780
that kinetic energy
and redirects it.

16:31.156 --> 16:38.414
So the bigger they are,
the harder you hit back.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.457
And while
the Parasite runs off

16:40.457 --> 16:43.669
the energy it absorbs,
for longer, sustained,
battery life,

16:43.669 --> 16:47.798
my portable Amazo panic room
has your back.

16:48.924 --> 16:50.050
Available now.

16:50.926 --> 16:52.511
Huh?

16:52.511 --> 16:55.264
The show is being controlled
from there. Come on.

16:57.433 --> 17:01.437
You know,
I built this company myself.

17:01.437 --> 17:04.606
And I deserve more.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.452
More!

17:30.466 --> 17:33.802
No, I am not letting you
interrupt Doctor--

17:34.887 --> 17:36.305
Sorry. Your life seems hard.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.931
We got to turn off the cage.

17:37.931 --> 17:39.975
One of these buttons
has to do it.

17:39.975 --> 17:41.477
Okay. Which one is it?

17:41.477 --> 17:42.895
A-ha, found you.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.980
Jimmy, this isn't the time
for taking pictures.

17:44.980 --> 17:49.067
UV light isn't just cool.
It can reveal fingerprints.

17:54.156 --> 17:54.990
Aah!

17:59.661 --> 18:00.704
Cheater!

18:04.458 --> 18:05.918
You cheated!

18:13.091 --> 18:15.427
This isn't a game.
You need to stop.

18:15.427 --> 18:16.804
You're afraid...

18:17.763 --> 18:20.140
that I'm better than you.

18:35.989 --> 18:36.824
Huh?

18:38.408 --> 18:39.743
I don't have to be better
than you.

18:39.743 --> 18:42.287
I just have to stop
supplying you with power.

18:42.287 --> 18:43.956
Fight me!

18:43.956 --> 18:45.290
No.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.543
Coward!

19:12.860 --> 19:14.278
Please, this man
needs your help.

19:15.779 --> 19:18.031
You ruined me.

19:18.031 --> 19:19.950
What's your angle?

19:19.950 --> 19:23.078
What's in this for you?

19:23.078 --> 19:24.872
Dr Ivo, look around you.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.624
Is it that hard to believe
that some people just want
to help?

19:36.216 --> 19:38.302
The proof's all there.

19:38.302 --> 19:40.512
The stolen tech, which Ivo
could only have gotten
from his criminal connections.

19:40.512 --> 19:43.348
Once we get the photos,
we'll have our story.

19:48.812 --> 19:50.939
I just can't believe
it all disappeared.

19:50.939 --> 19:53.066
Someone must have taken it
during the fight.

19:53.066 --> 19:54.776
But who?

19:54.776 --> 19:57.905
Lois, I have to figure
this out. Too many people
are getting hurt.

19:57.905 --> 20:01.408
It's cute seeing you
obsess over a story.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.119
You know,
when I was getting ready,

20:04.119 --> 20:06.496
I kept wondering
if this counted as a date.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.587
And what did you decide?

20:16.798 --> 20:18.675
Walk me back, Smallville.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.969
Yes! You guys have to see this.

20:20.969 --> 20:22.638
I got photos of everything.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.348
I even posted the fight
on Flamebird.

20:24.348 --> 20:27.309
I told you this was going
to be an amazing night out...

20:32.314 --> 20:34.232
With three best friends.

20:37.611 --> 20:42.532
An exclusive on the collapse
of a Amazo Tech is... sent.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.043
What is this?

20:55.879 --> 20:56.797
Huh.

21:11.186 --> 21:12.104
Hmm.

21:23.782 --> 21:24.700
What?

21:49.224 --> 21:50.183
No.

21:54.062 --> 21:56.690
Clark Kent is Superman?
