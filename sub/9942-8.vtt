Nobody's saying the Chatsworth Estate
is the Garden of Eden

00:06.010 --> 00:10.447
but it's been a good home to us -
to me, Frank Gallagher, and me kids,

00:10.490 --> 00:16.201
who l'm proud of, cos every single
one of 'em reminds me a little of me.

00:16.250 --> 00:20.766
They can all think for themselves,
which they've got me to thank for.

00:20.810 --> 00:21.925
Quick, leg it!

00:21.970 --> 00:24.325
Lip, who's a bit of a gobshite,
which is why nobody calls him

00:24.370 --> 00:26.361
Phillip any more.

00:26.410 --> 00:28.878
lan, a lot like his mam,
which is handy for the others

00:28.930 --> 00:31.398
cos she's disappeared into thin air.

00:31.450 --> 00:34.248
And Carl - we daren't let him
grow his hair for two reasons.

00:34.290 --> 00:36.440
One, it makes it stand on end
and makes him look like Toyah.

00:36.490 --> 00:42.122
Two, nits love it. Debbie, sent by
God, total angel - you've to check

00:42.170 --> 00:45.685
your change but she'll go miles
out of her way to do you a favour.

00:45.730 --> 00:48.449
Plus lickle Liam,
who's gonna be a star some day.

00:48.490 --> 00:50.685
Sheila, me bird,
couldn't be happier,

00:50.730 --> 00:52.402
one plate short of a full set, like.

00:52.450 --> 00:56.329
And fantastic neighbours
Kev and Veronica,

00:56.370 --> 00:58.725
lend ya anything,
well, almost anything.

00:58.770 --> 01:03.400
Carol and Marty, the lodgers from hell.
Last of the lonely hearts

01:03.450 --> 01:06.522
and a psychologist's wet dream.
Still, nobody's perfect.

01:06.570 --> 01:10.927
But all of 'em to a man know,
first and foremost,

01:10.970 --> 01:15.919
one of the most vital necessities in life is,
they know how to throw a party!

01:15.970 --> 01:17.198
Scatter!

01:19.130 --> 01:21.405
(Frank) 'Me first stag night,
the barman tells me a joke.

01:21.450 --> 01:24.567
'Kid goes up to his dad, says
he's heard that in some countries,

01:24.610 --> 01:26.362
'a man doesn't even know his
wife till he marries her.

01:26.410 --> 01:29.925
'His dad tells him, ''That happens
in every fucking country, son.''

01:29.970 --> 01:33.007
'And it's true, innit?
l mean, if l'd have known Monica

01:33.050 --> 01:35.928
'was gonna be a lezzer,
l'd never have married her, would l?

01:35.970 --> 01:41.124
'Well, yeah, probably, l mean, l'd have thought
l was in with a, you know, flesh sandwich.

01:41.170 --> 01:45.368
'But the point l'm making,
is, you just don't know, do you?

01:45.410 --> 01:49.528
'Spin the fucking wheel. So that's
the point of a stag do, innit?

01:49.570 --> 01:52.926
'Cos like the chief Roman said,
''Veni, vidi, vodka.''

01:52.970 --> 01:58.328
'Numb me fucking senses, boys, l'm
comin' in!' Whoa! Not fucking Marty!

02:19.170 --> 02:22.401
All right! Oh, that's lovely...

02:22.450 --> 02:23.963
Out the way, mate.

02:25.730 --> 02:27.846
No, Sheila.

02:27.890 --> 02:30.245
Tell me it's not Ground Force?

02:30.290 --> 02:32.167
lt's for the conservatory, Frank!
We're gonna have frosted glass

02:32.210 --> 02:35.919
and blackout blinds for when
l get a bit insidey outsidey.

02:35.970 --> 02:38.928
Hello? The garden's only
ten feet two.

02:38.970 --> 02:40.881
What the fuck we need
a conservatory for?

02:40.930 --> 02:43.160
The wedding!
You know what l'm like,

02:43.210 --> 02:45.883
five hours out here and
l'll go completely doolally.

02:45.930 --> 02:48.125
Well, put up a fucking
wigwam or summat.

02:48.170 --> 02:49.444
Too much daylight.

02:51.050 --> 02:53.086
< How many times, eh?

02:53.130 --> 02:55.690
lf you cold-turkey your tablets,
l need telling

02:55.730 --> 02:59.723
cos A, they're worth money,
B, they're a magnet for every

02:59.770 --> 03:04.480
fucking bronco for miles. How
the hell much is all this costing?

03:04.530 --> 03:05.519
8,000 plus VAT.

03:05.570 --> 03:08.482
Well, we knocked a few quid
off for signing on the spot.

03:08.530 --> 03:11.727
There. There you go.

03:11.770 --> 03:15.399
l said l wanted a conservatory,
Frank! lt's my money.

03:15.450 --> 03:17.441
You haven't got eight grand.

03:17.490 --> 03:18.400
l've got a mortgage.

03:18.450 --> 03:19.599
Three, two, one, back in the room.

03:19.650 --> 03:23.928
Fuck's a re-mortgage costing
me...us...you?

03:23.970 --> 03:26.200
Peanuts, Frank!
Cos l paid off the house last year.

03:26.250 --> 03:28.764
But if l'm gonna be honest,
l missed filing all those bits

03:28.810 --> 03:32.280
of paper they used to send me. So l
took the money out and everything.

03:32.330 --> 03:34.719
l hid it in here.

03:34.770 --> 03:38.319
Well, you always said l
shouldn't let people take advantage.

03:41.250 --> 03:42.399
Come here, you!

03:45.890 --> 03:48.484
God, you are a total one-off!

03:50.730 --> 03:52.800
Why don't you let Frank
take care of that, eh?

03:52.850 --> 03:53.839
OK.

03:55.250 --> 03:58.048
So how much you over-quoted?

03:58.090 --> 03:59.921
Three grand? Four? Let's say four.

03:59.970 --> 04:02.723
Eh? Four grand, split it 50-50.
Gizza receipt for the lot.

04:02.770 --> 04:04.089
Job's eight grand.

04:04.130 --> 04:06.405
On your fucking bike, Tonto!
You seen Watchdog?

04:06.450 --> 04:07.803
Yeah?

04:07.850 --> 04:10.569
Presenter? Sheila's brother. Twins.

04:10.610 --> 04:12.441
He's Scottish.

04:12.490 --> 04:14.242
Phone A Friend or fuck off.

04:15.690 --> 04:20.161
We run an honest business here.
Pay our taxes, all above board.

04:20.209 --> 04:22.519
l've just pulled a cake out
if we're all done and dusted?

04:22.570 --> 04:24.481
Beer, anyone? Gin and tonic?

04:24.530 --> 04:26.964
Nah, l'm all right, thanks, love.
And he's had enough.

04:28.010 --> 04:30.319
Where the fuck did you dig them up?

04:30.370 --> 04:32.281
Advert in the Church Gazette.

04:36.090 --> 04:37.967
Right.

04:38.010 --> 04:41.286
Well, thanks for telling me.

04:41.330 --> 04:43.525
Veronica!

04:43.570 --> 04:46.368
Those tights you gave
me have got a hole in.

04:46.410 --> 04:47.240
Not now, Mum.

04:47.290 --> 04:49.246
Ooh, what's the matter with her?
Lost a fiver, found a...

04:49.290 --> 04:50.803
l said, not now!

04:54.090 --> 04:57.969
l've just found out
me lVF's failed again.

04:58.010 --> 05:00.763
l don't know why you want kids anyway.
Pain in the bloody arse,

05:00.810 --> 05:05.361
if you ask me. Bleed you dry,
take away the best years of your life

05:05.410 --> 05:07.844
and then they grow up
to be a total waste.

05:07.890 --> 05:12.168
Tell you what, Mum, don't mince your
words, say what you really feel.

05:12.210 --> 05:14.883
l mean, it's not much better
from where l'm standing, is it?

05:14.930 --> 05:16.886
l mean, what did l get?

05:16.930 --> 05:18.568
Jane of the fucking jungle.

05:18.610 --> 05:21.283
But with a beard.

05:25.490 --> 05:27.560
Wedding dress. Done.

05:27.610 --> 05:30.761
Order flowers. Done. Wedding cake?

05:30.810 --> 05:33.961
Martha Stewart Berry Basket Cake
with wooden dowel supports, if l can

05:34.010 --> 05:37.719
get the wooden dowels. lf not, l'll
just have to use toilet roll holders.

05:37.770 --> 05:40.443
And you're making that
yourself, so, done! Right,

05:40.490 --> 05:44.085
that brings us to bridesmaids and
you'll obviously want Karen as one.

05:44.130 --> 05:47.247
Me? Bridesmaid? You must be joking!

05:47.290 --> 05:50.805
So that just leaves me,
and Liam as page boy.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.205
l've just had to turn your water
off, love, while we do the digging.

05:53.250 --> 05:54.239
OK.

05:54.290 --> 05:57.521
Right, so that's me and Liam, and l
need a bridesmaid's dress,

05:57.570 --> 05:59.162
so l've found one...

05:59.210 --> 06:01.166
Digging? What does he mean, digging?

06:03.850 --> 06:05.806
But l don't understand.
Why are you digging?

06:05.850 --> 06:07.124
For the foundations!

06:07.170 --> 06:09.604
The ground's solid!
Just put it on there, can't you?

06:09.650 --> 06:12.483
Well, it won't stand up.
We've only gotta dig a few feet.

06:12.530 --> 06:14.646
l said no!
l don't want digging!

06:14.690 --> 06:17.079
But if we don't dig, you
can't have a conservatory.

06:17.130 --> 06:19.121
- All right, just forget it then.
- You what?

06:19.170 --> 06:21.206
l said, forget it.
l don't want a conservatory.

06:21.250 --> 06:22.968
Are you joking or what?
l've booked time in for this job.

06:23.010 --> 06:23.999
And you can't have a refund!

06:24.050 --> 06:27.008
Then keep the money!
And the cake too, if you want it.

06:28.570 --> 06:31.880
Look, l've bought all the gear now!
Let's just get on with it.

06:36.410 --> 06:38.048
Well, that's it then, innit?

06:38.090 --> 06:41.605
No more freebies on the NHS.

06:41.650 --> 06:46.201
And me and Kev sure as shit haven't
got two grand for going private,

06:46.250 --> 06:47.683
so it looks like game over.

06:47.730 --> 06:50.563
ls it still Kev's
sperm that's the problem?

06:50.610 --> 06:52.521
Still doing backstroke.

06:52.570 --> 07:00.124
Thing is, he never wanted 'em, till bloody
mouth almighty started going on about it.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.649
Now he's desperate.

07:03.370 --> 07:05.838
How am l gonna tell him that
they've failed again? l mean...

07:05.890 --> 07:08.927
When they've been hand picked
and scored out of a hundred.

07:08.970 --> 07:14.328
And kids like Mandy Maguire can get
pregnant from just fucking sneezing.

07:14.370 --> 07:15.689
How's that fair?

07:18.970 --> 07:21.006
Have you ever thought
about having any?

07:22.090 --> 07:24.888
Yeah. Dunno...

07:24.930 --> 07:26.409
< Lot of work, aren't they?

07:39.970 --> 07:43.042
< Leave my patio alone!

07:43.090 --> 07:46.366
Leave it alone! Don't make me do this
cos l will!

07:46.410 --> 07:48.640
Hey! What's going on?
Sheila! Sheila!

07:48.690 --> 07:51.568
l don't want it!
l don't want it!

07:51.610 --> 07:53.601
lt's all right. No digging. >

07:53.650 --> 07:56.084
l don't want them to do it.

07:56.130 --> 07:57.643
They won't, they won't.

07:57.690 --> 07:59.328
lt'll be all right, it's all right,
they'll leave it alone.

07:59.370 --> 08:01.247
Fucking hell!

08:02.810 --> 08:04.641
l'm so sorry. l'm so sorry, Frank.

08:04.690 --> 08:07.443
lt's just so awful. lt was so awful.

08:07.490 --> 08:09.128
All right, all right.
There's no need for...

08:09.170 --> 08:12.048
Frank!
There's something l need to tell you.

08:12.090 --> 08:14.684
l can't marry you
without telling you!

08:14.730 --> 08:16.163
You're not a bloke, are you?

08:16.210 --> 08:18.041
No! Course not!

08:18.090 --> 08:20.001
No. No.

08:20.050 --> 08:21.563
l was married, before...

08:21.610 --> 08:24.443
before Eddie.

08:24.490 --> 08:26.720
Before Eddie...Karen's dad, Eddie?

08:26.770 --> 08:28.806
Yeah, Sheldon.

08:28.850 --> 08:32.604
But he died... of a heart attack.

08:32.650 --> 08:35.448
Oh, well,

08:35.490 --> 08:37.446
you know,

08:37.490 --> 08:39.082
some of these blokes these days

08:39.130 --> 08:40.881
don't take care of themselves,
do they, you know?

08:40.929 --> 08:42.522
No exercise, pissing it up...

08:44.250 --> 08:46.525
But l mean,

08:46.570 --> 08:49.323
if it's putting you off
getting married again, Sheila...

08:49.370 --> 08:50.644
No! No! No, it's not that.

08:52.130 --> 08:53.643
lt's just...

08:53.690 --> 08:55.487
he's buried

08:55.530 --> 08:57.725
in the garden.

09:02.410 --> 09:07.200
You serious?
No coffin, nothing?!

09:08.050 --> 09:10.245
She just wrapped him in a doily,

09:10.290 --> 09:14.203
said a few Hail Marys and
shoved him six feet under.

09:14.250 --> 09:16.844
lt's what he would've wanted,
she reckons.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.960
Give us another pint, Kev,
and a couple of E's.

09:19.010 --> 09:21.649
< lt's a bit fucking weird, though.

09:22.690 --> 09:24.442
Course it's a bit fucking weird!

09:24.490 --> 09:26.845
Fucking Michael Jackson
video in your back garden!

09:26.890 --> 09:29.723
Stiff under the whatsit bush!
lt's hardly Mr And Mrs, is it?

09:29.770 --> 09:32.682
Hey, d'you reckon Karen knows?

09:32.730 --> 09:34.766
Hey, Karen...

09:34.810 --> 09:37.483
Don't tell her, you stupid bastard!

09:37.530 --> 09:39.088
lt's not like he's her dad.

09:39.130 --> 09:41.564
So what did Sheila said about it?
ls she all right?

09:41.610 --> 09:43.566
How the fuck should l know?

09:47.850 --> 09:48.839
Ooh.

09:50.050 --> 09:51.403
Oh.

09:52.010 --> 09:54.922
Hey, hey. So, er... So should
we have heard from the hospital?

09:54.970 --> 09:56.642
Should have been today.

09:56.690 --> 09:58.646
lt might be tomorrow.

09:58.690 --> 10:00.362
l'll take him home, shall l?

10:00.410 --> 10:02.765
Make sure Sheila's all right,
find out what l can.

10:02.810 --> 10:04.687
Come on, tosspot!

10:10.610 --> 10:12.601
Cheers!

10:12.650 --> 10:15.118
Ah, look at that, Liam.
You'd look sweet in that.

10:15.170 --> 10:16.444
Oi!

10:16.490 --> 10:18.845
Who's the - spunk face
- short arse outside?

10:18.890 --> 10:21.643
Who? Oh, not again!

10:21.690 --> 10:23.248
What does he want?

10:23.290 --> 10:24.518
Where?

10:24.570 --> 10:26.879
Ah, go on Debs, he's your
boyfriend, in' he?

10:26.930 --> 10:28.488
You're joking, aren't you?!

10:28.530 --> 10:31.408
He's only about four!
Someone tell him l've gone out.

10:31.450 --> 10:32.439
Come on, Liam.

10:35.610 --> 10:37.680
Fuck off!

10:38.890 --> 10:41.245
Thanks for bringing him home.

10:41.290 --> 10:44.805
Well, l thought l'd come and see
how it's going, you know wi'...

10:44.850 --> 10:45.965
wi' wedding and that.

10:46.010 --> 10:49.764
Sorry l haven't got much to
offer you. l could do you a vodka.

10:49.810 --> 10:51.801
So is that where he's buried, then?

10:51.850 --> 10:53.488
What?!

10:53.530 --> 10:55.248
Oh, l'm.. l'm sorry. lt's just...

10:55.290 --> 10:59.442
Well, Frank said... and,

What the hell happened?

11:01.450 --> 11:03.441
Oohh.. There's...

11:03.490 --> 11:05.242
Let me, er... Let me do those.

11:05.290 --> 11:08.327
There's not really
much to tell, actually.

11:08.370 --> 11:11.043
l just...couldn't handle
the funeral.

11:11.090 --> 11:12.842
Was the agoraphobia.

11:12.890 --> 11:15.279
And when he fell down stairs
and killed himself,

11:15.330 --> 11:19.243
l thought, the garden's
just as good a place as any.

11:19.290 --> 11:22.566
And he loved that garden,
he loved it.

11:22.610 --> 11:27.559
He used to sit out there
and point where to plant things.

11:27.610 --> 11:31.319
Fell down the stairs?
l... l thought he had a heart attack.

11:31.370 --> 11:35.204
He did. He did. He did,
after he fell down the stairs.

11:35.250 --> 11:38.322
l thought maybe l should've
done him a headstone,

11:38.370 --> 11:40.645
but it would've spoiled
the symmetry.

11:40.690 --> 11:42.521
l mean there wasn't any time.

11:42.570 --> 11:45.960
l didn't even have time to take
off his jewellery.

11:46.010 --> 11:48.080
He didn't like me
to touch him anyway.

11:48.130 --> 11:51.327
That's why l can't wear gold.

11:51.370 --> 11:54.521
That's why l have to
wear fake or platinum. >

11:54.570 --> 11:58.119
Maybe l should have phoned someone
but l knew he was dead because

11:58.170 --> 12:00.047
he didn't get up to watch The Sweeney.

12:00.090 --> 12:02.365
The Sweeney...

12:02.410 --> 12:04.321
What did Frank say? >

12:04.370 --> 12:05.769
What did he say?

12:05.810 --> 12:08.449
How much gold, Sheila?

12:15.530 --> 12:19.523
You look nice, Carol. l always
think animal prints suit you.

12:19.570 --> 12:21.447
Veronica's put you up
to this, hasn't she?

12:21.490 --> 12:22.889
No, of course not.

12:22.930 --> 12:25.524
Hmm. Well, whatever it is
you're wanting, l'm not biting.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.367
Hiya, Debbie. >

12:27.410 --> 12:33.280
Doing a good trade on the confetti.
Waste not, fucking want not.

12:35.250 --> 12:40.483
The thing is, it's not actually
me wanting something. lt's Sheila.

12:40.530 --> 12:45.558
She's stressed about the wedding and
she wants me to be her bridesmaid but...

12:45.610 --> 12:47.089
The answer's no.

12:47.130 --> 12:49.325
Oh, go on, Carol, please.

12:49.370 --> 12:51.281
l'm not nicking you a dress.

12:51.330 --> 12:53.605
l got cautioned the last time. >

12:53.650 --> 12:55.880
l can't take that chance again.

12:58.010 --> 13:00.843
All right, Yvonne?
Just a pack of gum for me.

13:01.810 --> 13:02.845
3.20.

13:02.890 --> 13:06.280
Take What You Want Day for
bearded ladies were last week, Carol.

13:12.410 --> 13:13.729
Thank you.

13:18.410 --> 13:20.480
Why are you following me?

13:20.530 --> 13:23.567
l've got Racing Ninjas.

13:23.610 --> 13:25.487
Look, Brian, the thing is...

13:25.530 --> 13:28.363
l don't want to be rude or anything.

13:28.410 --> 13:30.241
l'm just not really interested.

13:30.290 --> 13:33.282
lt's nothing personal or anything.
lt's just...

13:33.330 --> 13:36.845
lt's all about chemicals in your
brain and you can't help those -

13:36.890 --> 13:39.404
who you've got them for
and who you haven't.

13:39.450 --> 13:42.283
And with you, l just haven't.

13:42.330 --> 13:45.800
Sorry. No hard feelings, eh?

13:45.850 --> 13:49.399
You can have me skateboard
if you let me kiss ya.

13:51.130 --> 13:53.007
l don't want a skateboard.

13:54.050 --> 13:56.803
What l want is a bridesmaid dress.

14:00.490 --> 14:01.969
Frank? Frank!

14:05.850 --> 14:07.568
What d'ya do that for?!

14:07.610 --> 14:09.919
She's buried him with a load of gold!

14:09.970 --> 14:12.643
He was covered in it!
Rings, watches, teeth.

14:12.690 --> 14:14.521
Must be worth a fortune.

14:16.210 --> 14:18.280
What the fuck's
that gotta do wi' me?

14:18.330 --> 14:20.048
We need to dig him up!

14:20.090 --> 14:22.206
Dig? Are you off your f...
Dig him up?!

14:22.250 --> 14:25.162
lt's not Brookside.
He's a dead person!

14:25.210 --> 14:27.849
Well, exactly!
He don't need it, does he, eh?

14:27.890 --> 14:30.802
lt were years ago.
He'll only be a bag of bones.

14:30.850 --> 14:35.162
Oh, and what? You don't think
he's entitled to everlasting...

14:35.210 --> 14:36.962
you know, fucking whatsit?

14:37.010 --> 14:39.968
A man's soul's has a right to
be left in peace, doesn't he,

14:40.010 --> 14:41.602
or what is the world coming to?

14:41.650 --> 14:44.881
You can say a few prayers
when you bury him again.

14:46.450 --> 14:48.884
Come on, Frank.

14:48.930 --> 14:50.568
Kev's cousin can fence it.

14:50.610 --> 14:52.282
All we need to do

14:52.330 --> 14:57.563
is get rid of Sheila for the night,
dig him up, split it 50/50.

14:57.610 --> 14:59.123
lt's yours by rights.

14:59.170 --> 15:01.843
Yeah, but... ls it?

15:01.890 --> 15:06.566
Yeah, course it is! Cos...well,
Sheldon were married to Sheila...

15:06.610 --> 15:07.201
Yeah..

15:07.250 --> 15:09.127
..which makes her his next of kin...

15:09.170 --> 15:11.843
..you're married to Sheila...

15:11.890 --> 15:15.678
Well, near enough,
so that makes you her...

15:15.730 --> 15:17.686
l really need this money, Frank!

15:17.730 --> 15:19.448
And don't pretend you don't.

15:19.490 --> 15:23.199
Money Sheila's spending on
this wedding. lt's payback.

15:23.250 --> 15:26.765
That's better. Ooh, you're awake.

15:27.530 --> 15:28.724
Oh...

15:49.530 --> 15:51.646
That was a bit hardcore.

15:52.730 --> 15:54.322
What time is it?

15:54.370 --> 15:56.088
'Bout three.

15:58.090 --> 15:59.569
Shit!

16:16.610 --> 16:19.522
Mandy, l'm here! l'm here now.

16:19.570 --> 16:20.525
Fuck you, Lip!

16:20.570 --> 16:23.642
Look, just let me take her.
l said l would.

16:23.690 --> 16:25.806
You said you'd be here at two!

16:25.850 --> 16:28.523
Just one afternoon out with me
friends, that's all l wanted!

16:28.570 --> 16:29.559
Well, l'm here now.

16:29.610 --> 16:32.807
You're not reliable! l said l
didn't want you involved with her.

16:32.850 --> 16:36.126
l said you'd get bored and
fuck me over, and you have!

16:36.170 --> 16:38.479
We don't need that
in our lives, Lip.

16:38.530 --> 16:41.408
You're gonna end up like
your own fucking dad!

16:54.130 --> 16:55.688
Mandy... !

16:55.730 --> 16:58.324
l thought we'd agreed
to make a go of it.

16:59.210 --> 17:00.848
Fuck!

17:01.850 --> 17:04.045
Look, she'll calm down, Lip.

17:04.089 --> 17:06.160
She's just pissed off with you.

17:06.210 --> 17:08.565
She's right, though, isn't she?
l fucked up.

17:08.609 --> 17:12.159
OK, so tell her you're sorry and
tell her you'll make it up to her.

17:12.210 --> 17:14.040
l don't wanna be like him.

17:14.089 --> 17:16.285
l wanna be a good dad.

17:16.329 --> 17:19.163
Look, do you think... Well...

17:19.210 --> 17:21.963
What if l asked her
to move in wi' me?

17:22.010 --> 17:25.286
l'd be there for her all the time
and she'd know l mean it.

17:25.329 --> 17:26.922
l suppose.

17:26.970 --> 17:32.283
l could redecorate my room, do it how
she likes. That's commitment, isn't it?

17:32.330 --> 17:33.524
Yeah.

17:41.970 --> 17:44.484
Where d'you get this from?

17:46.090 --> 17:47.079
Wrong colour.

17:50.530 --> 17:52.282
Party!

17:52.330 --> 17:54.719
Come on, kid.

17:54.770 --> 17:56.203

17:56.250 --> 17:57.683
< Party!

17:57.730 --> 17:59.243
ls it a hen night or something?

17:59.290 --> 18:00.689
Maybe we should invite
some of the others.

18:00.730 --> 18:02.402
No, we can do that later.

18:02.450 --> 18:06.409
We thought we'd have a celebration.
Get the girl a drink, Vee.

18:06.450 --> 18:10.841
Whey-ey! Come on!

18:13.410 --> 18:16.447

18:31.610 --> 18:34.488

18:34.530 --> 18:35.758

18:42.010 --> 18:43.284

18:43.330 --> 18:44.683
l stole it.

18:44.730 --> 18:46.049
Where from?

18:46.090 --> 18:49.480
Me dad works at a printers and
they make wedding invitations,

18:49.530 --> 18:51.998
so l know who's getting married.

18:52.050 --> 18:54.848
Don't cry...
Please stop crying, honey.

18:54.890 --> 18:55.959
You'll be all right.

18:56.010 --> 18:58.285
We'll sort you out a dress.
You'll be fine.

19:00.530 --> 19:04.205
So, Brian, how many more
weddings d'you know of?

19:05.690 --> 19:06.679
MUSlC: Dancing Queen by ABBA

19:06.730 --> 19:08.402
Ooh, l love this one.

19:12.890 --> 19:15.085

19:37.850 --> 19:40.887
Go on. Go on, go on,

19:44.930 --> 19:46.568
Oh, thank fuck for that.

19:46.610 --> 19:48.168
How many did you give her?

19:48.210 --> 19:49.404
Ten.

19:55.570 --> 19:56.719
You don't think she's...?

19:56.770 --> 19:58.362
SNORES

20:01.250 --> 20:04.287
That's the thing about women, see?

20:04.330 --> 20:07.163
Devious. Like Alistair fucking Campbell.

20:07.210 --> 20:09.201
Tick, tick, tee-tee-tee.

20:09.250 --> 20:13.402
Make out that there's nothing
going on, but inside...

20:13.450 --> 20:17.409
l mean, where's Kev while
you're here, eh, witching hour,

20:17.450 --> 20:19.281
legs straddling a fucking corpse?

20:19.330 --> 20:22.606
At home in bed,
none the flaming wiser.

20:22.650 --> 20:25.722
More to the point,
where are you, Frank?

20:25.770 --> 20:28.079
You're meant to be fucking helping!

20:28.130 --> 20:29.643
No, l can't go there.

20:29.690 --> 20:31.282
l'm getting flashbacks to me mam.

20:31.330 --> 20:35.209
Anyway, you were a fucking nurse.
You're used to dead bod...

20:37.050 --> 20:40.599
Fucking hell, Frank!
l think l've found him.

20:40.650 --> 20:46.247
Have a look. Can you see the gold?

20:50.450 --> 20:52.486
Bloody hell!

20:59.770 --> 21:01.249
(Veronica) There's a watch, though.

21:06.250 --> 21:08.764
And some rings.

21:15.210 --> 21:17.599
Fuck...me.

21:24.890 --> 21:26.642
Jesus Christ on a bike!

21:29.850 --> 21:33.445
That was some
fucking fall down the stairs.

21:38.450 --> 21:41.920
MUSlC: Wedding March by Mendelssohn

21:44.850 --> 21:47.808
Here. Got you a double.

21:48.650 --> 21:50.561
''Dig him up,'' she said.
''Won't hurt anyone.''

21:50.610 --> 21:53.682
No, you've not just found out you're
marrying Myra fucking Hindley.

21:53.730 --> 21:56.119
Frank, l am just as freaked out
about this as you are.

21:56.170 --> 21:58.604
Oh, how's that work?!
Are you lying awake at 3am

21:58.650 --> 22:01.767
wondering whether you're
gonna make it till breakfast time?

22:01.810 --> 22:03.038
Look. >

22:05.570 --> 22:09.563
This wouldn't normally be my first
port of call, but maybe we should

22:09.610 --> 22:12.966
think about going to the police.
You could say you were gardening...

22:13.010 --> 22:14.807
Hey! How come
suddenly it's all about me?!

22:14.850 --> 22:15.839
You're the one
who fucking dug him up.

22:15.890 --> 22:17.403
Frank!

22:17.450 --> 22:19.566
You wanna pull yourself together.

22:19.610 --> 22:22.204
There might be a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

22:22.250 --> 22:24.366
For a fondue set in the ribs?!

22:24.410 --> 22:26.685
What, he thought
''Oh, l'll try a bit of acupuncture

22:26.730 --> 22:28.083
''to cure the heart attack...

22:28.130 --> 22:30.724
''Oh dear, l've stabbed myself
to death''? l don't think so.

22:30.770 --> 22:34.763
lf you go to the police, we've lost
the gold, so shut up about it.

22:35.730 --> 22:38.005
When did you turn
into Lara Croft, Tomb Raider?

22:41.170 --> 22:42.842
Shit!

22:45.050 --> 22:50.170
Ooh, l've got a shocking head!
Didn't sleep properly last night.

22:50.210 --> 22:54.567
l was up and down like a yo-yo.
Sorry, am l interrupting something?

22:54.610 --> 22:56.840
No, we were just talking
about the wedding.

22:56.890 --> 22:59.848
- Frank's really looking forward to it.
- Oh, Frank, are you?

22:59.890 --> 23:02.529
Course l am, yeah.

23:02.570 --> 23:03.969
l've got my dress fitting today.

23:04.010 --> 23:05.079
Great.

23:05.130 --> 23:09.169
l've got a diamante bodice,
nylon tulle veil, modesty panel.

23:09.210 --> 23:14.000
l know you don't like looking after
the twins but l thought maybe for...

23:14.050 --> 23:17.486
Course l do!
No, don't be silly! Any time!

23:17.530 --> 23:18.599
- lt'd only be for an hour.
- Yeah.

23:18.650 --> 23:21.005
Don't question it, Sheila,
he might change his mind!

23:21.050 --> 23:23.041
Anyway, l've gotta shoot.

23:23.090 --> 23:25.046
Hey, Veronica!

23:25.090 --> 23:26.318
Have you got moles, then?

23:27.890 --> 23:29.209
You what, Lillian?

23:29.250 --> 23:33.368
Moles. Our Leslie saw you digging
in't garden. She lives over the back.

23:33.410 --> 23:37.323
No, Lillian, no, it's the diggers...
We got the builders in. lt's not us.

23:37.370 --> 23:40.646
lt was definitely you.
ln the night. She wanted to go.

23:40.690 --> 23:44.603
No, she must've been dreaming it.
Dreamt it. You know what she's like.

23:44.650 --> 23:46.686
Hang on. Sheila, come on darling.

23:46.730 --> 23:49.369
(Lillian) She did tell me it were you.
She knows yer house.

23:49.410 --> 23:52.447
Lillian! Hang on, love. Just go on,
darling, you enjoy yourself.

23:52.490 --> 23:54.799
She told me it were you,
she knows yer house.

23:54.850 --> 23:57.205
Hey, your work on this planet is
finished, return to your own people.

23:57.250 --> 24:00.048
She don't tell lies. She saw yer.

24:10.170 --> 24:11.888
Fucking hell.

24:11.930 --> 24:15.923
No. No. No.

24:18.050 --> 24:20.245
Look, Lip, l told you.

24:20.290 --> 24:22.360
(Lip) Just come with us a minute.

24:22.410 --> 24:25.243
Debs, watch Katie.

24:25.290 --> 24:27.281
What we doing, Lip?

24:27.330 --> 24:29.764
You'll see in a minute.

24:29.810 --> 24:33.041
All right, you ready?

24:35.050 --> 24:36.039
Ta da!

24:39.930 --> 24:41.363
What's this meant to be?

24:41.410 --> 24:43.048
lt's for you.

24:43.090 --> 24:46.400
l thought if you moved in here,
l'll be around, won't l?

24:46.450 --> 24:47.439
Won't be able to forget things.

24:47.490 --> 24:50.243
Lip, a couple of coats of paint
aren't gonna solve anything.

24:50.290 --> 24:53.362
And what makes you think l'm
gonna move in here with you lot?

24:53.410 --> 24:55.560
lt's a fucking mad house.

24:55.610 --> 24:59.364
No offence,
but l'd rather eat me own sick.

24:59.410 --> 25:01.207
l don't understand you.

25:02.250 --> 25:04.241
But l want it to work, Mandy.

25:04.290 --> 25:08.681
Yeah, so do l.
But it's us we've gotta sort out.

25:08.730 --> 25:10.561
The real stuff.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.089
Not some fucking paint job.

25:18.290 --> 25:19.928
l don't want to, Debbie.

25:19.970 --> 25:21.562
Brian! You said you'd help me.

25:21.610 --> 25:23.840
You said l could kiss you.

25:23.890 --> 25:26.450
Just help me get
the dress and l'll...

25:26.490 --> 25:28.048
Just one, OK? Here.

25:29.690 --> 25:32.762
On the mouth.
On the mouth or l'm not doing it.

25:33.850 --> 25:37.445
Just help me get the dress,
all right?

25:45.250 --> 25:46.763
Where'd you get it from?

25:46.810 --> 25:50.325
Oh, you know,
grave robbing, usual stuff!

25:50.370 --> 25:52.600
l'd put it back if l was you.

25:52.650 --> 25:56.848
- Eh?
- lt's fake. The lot of it. Ain't worth a penny.

26:05.970 --> 26:08.120
Come on then, let me see.

26:08.170 --> 26:09.649
All right, then.

26:09.690 --> 26:12.921
But make it quick. And if you
gob on me, l'll throw up on you.

26:16.930 --> 26:18.568
Well go on, then!

26:20.170 --> 26:22.206
l think you're horrible.

26:22.250 --> 26:24.445
You think you're really it
but you're not.

26:24.490 --> 26:27.641
You're just using me, and you
shouldn't do that cos it's wrong.

26:27.690 --> 26:30.409
l don't wanna kiss you.
l don't wanna see you ever again.

26:41.330 --> 26:43.207
Frank?

26:44.890 --> 26:46.608
Are you all right about tomorrow?

26:46.650 --> 26:48.800
l can't wait to be Mrs Gallagher.

26:52.450 --> 26:54.805
l think l'll just hit the hay,
Sheila.

27:06.690 --> 27:09.329
Just locking up for
the night, Frank. >

27:20.370 --> 27:21.564
Frank?

27:23.370 --> 27:26.601
Yeah, just in here, love.

27:27.850 --> 27:31.001
Frank, are you all right, love?

27:31.050 --> 27:33.962
Yeah, just...you know...

27:36.570 --> 27:38.208
ls there something wrong?

27:39.530 --> 27:41.441
Frank? >

27:42.410 --> 27:43.968
What Lillian said...

27:44.010 --> 27:46.729
Were you digging? >

27:50.370 --> 27:52.088
Did you dig him up?!

27:53.530 --> 27:55.839
Sorry, love. Can't hear you.

27:57.530 --> 27:59.043
Did you dig him up?!

28:00.610 --> 28:01.759
Did you dig him up?

28:02.890 --> 28:04.289
Did you dig him up, Frank?

28:25.170 --> 28:25.647
Hey, erm...

28:25.690 --> 28:26.805
< Veronica.

28:26.850 --> 28:29.444
You've heard, haven't you?

28:29.490 --> 28:31.208
From the hospital.

28:31.250 --> 28:34.128
lt's not good news, is it?

28:34.170 --> 28:37.082
No.

28:37.130 --> 28:40.839
Oh, look, l'm really sorry.

28:40.890 --> 28:42.164
l just didn't know how to tell you.

28:42.210 --> 28:43.359
You're all right.

28:43.410 --> 28:44.729
< Veronica!

28:44.770 --> 28:46.567
Veronica!

28:46.610 --> 28:48.202
For fuck's sake!

28:48.250 --> 28:49.729
Mind your feet! >

28:49.770 --> 28:52.284
What the fuck are you
playing at, Frank?!

28:53.410 --> 28:54.399
Let me in!

28:54.450 --> 28:56.281
You've just broken
the fucking window!

28:56.330 --> 29:00.482
Look... l need the
money from the gold.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.088
What fucking gold?!

29:02.130 --> 29:03.245
You've done what?!

29:03.290 --> 29:05.121
He were fucking dead anyway!

29:05.170 --> 29:07.365
Correction - murdered. How much?

29:07.410 --> 29:09.719
- Hey, you what?!
- Sheila murdered him. So?

29:09.770 --> 29:11.886
- She murdered him? You're joking.
- Wish l fucking was, mate.

29:11.930 --> 29:14.524
Well, Frank, it was a big fat zero
cos it's all fake,

29:14.570 --> 29:16.322
so fucking tough shit on both of us.

29:16.370 --> 29:17.689
So l dug up that
body up for nothing?

29:17.730 --> 29:19.925
You didn't dig him up, l fucking did!

29:19.970 --> 29:22.530
That gold was my
get out of jail free card!

29:22.570 --> 29:25.004
How the hell am l gonna
get away from her now?!

29:25.050 --> 29:28.679
- Whoa, what you on about?
- She knows! Fucking Lillian,

29:28.730 --> 29:31.005
fucking...
And now she's gonna kill me.

29:31.050 --> 29:34.565
No, it's not fucking funny!
You didn't see her with that spade.

29:34.610 --> 29:37.044
They get a taste for it, don't they?
l've seen Crimewatch.

29:37.090 --> 29:41.208
(Veronica) - Oh, for fuck's sake!
- What the hell am l gonna do now?!

29:41.250 --> 29:43.605
l'm gonna have to stay here
while l get me head together.

29:43.650 --> 29:45.368
You are joking. Over my dead body!

29:45.410 --> 29:48.720
lt's me darkest hour, Veronica!
Me dream wedding in tatters.

29:48.770 --> 29:51.921
Me kids are not taking pity on me.
Lip's already thrown me out.

29:51.970 --> 29:53.688
Well, tell it to Oprah! Now fuck off!

29:57.450 --> 30:01.125
Veronica, you can't do this
to me, l'm a marked man!

30:01.170 --> 30:03.525
You got me into this! Veronica!

30:03.570 --> 30:05.083
Go home, Frank!

30:09.010 --> 30:09.999
Piss!

30:12.210 --> 30:14.087
l don't believe you!

30:14.130 --> 30:16.325
l know. Don't.

30:16.370 --> 30:18.122
What were you thinking?!

30:18.170 --> 30:24.564
l thought we could use
the money to...for lVF.

30:24.610 --> 30:26.965
l know how much you want it, Kev.

30:27.010 --> 30:29.649
Oh, you...

30:29.690 --> 30:31.169
Come here, you daft cow.

30:34.610 --> 30:38.683
Hey, not many blokes could say their
wife'd go grave robbing for 'em.

30:38.730 --> 30:40.721
Ooh, it were horrible and all.

30:40.770 --> 30:42.408
And he stank!

30:42.450 --> 30:43.644
Ooh.

30:43.690 --> 30:45.760
Look, Vee,

30:45.810 --> 30:48.643
we're all right.
We don't need no-one else.

30:51.930 --> 30:54.364
Hey, but we don't need
to be trying for a baby...

30:55.930 --> 30:57.488
..to have sex, do we?

30:57.530 --> 30:58.929
No!

30:58.970 --> 31:00.449
Let us in, then!

31:15.210 --> 31:16.484
Frank?

31:26.570 --> 31:27.764
Frank?

31:29.210 --> 31:32.327
Are you there, love?

31:32.930 --> 31:36.286
Carl...is your dad there?

31:36.330 --> 31:37.968
No. Why?

31:38.010 --> 31:39.159
l think he's left me.

31:39.210 --> 31:40.689
Hey, give over, Sheila.

31:40.730 --> 31:43.688
He's...he's probably with...

31:43.730 --> 31:47.040
He's probably out
with Kev somewhere, isn't he?

31:47.090 --> 31:49.320
Getting ready and that.

31:49.370 --> 31:52.328
lt's bad luck to see you on
your wedding day, in't it?

31:52.370 --> 31:55.965
Look, why don't you go home?

31:56.010 --> 31:58.365
Don't worry, we'll find him.

32:00.610 --> 32:01.599
l'll get him.

32:04.530 --> 32:07.488
What the fuck are you doing, Frank?
lt's your wedding day.

32:07.530 --> 32:10.408
You can't just disappear.
She's in pieces.

32:10.450 --> 32:12.805
Yeah, but what about me?

32:12.850 --> 32:15.000
l'm a hunted man!

32:15.050 --> 32:18.042
She's got a fucking spade, Veronica!

32:18.090 --> 32:21.924
lf you're not gonna marry her, Frank,
you have gotta tell her.

32:21.970 --> 32:24.609
Sort him out, will you?
l'm going to Sheila's.

32:26.610 --> 32:28.202
Come on, knobhead.

32:28.250 --> 32:31.879
All right, so you dig up this
bloke and she's killed him, right?

32:31.930 --> 32:35.206
Yeah, and who's to say
he's not the only one?

32:35.250 --> 32:39.129
Remember...Eddie The Owl?

32:39.170 --> 32:41.161
Fucking missionary work?

32:41.210 --> 32:43.724
ln Africa? Or six feet under?

32:43.770 --> 32:45.886
What's the more likely, eh?

32:45.930 --> 32:48.285
Look, the only reason you
know about Sheldon

32:48.330 --> 32:50.798
is cos she told you.
What's she gonna tell you for

32:50.850 --> 32:52.920
if she's planning on
giving you the same?

32:52.970 --> 32:54.881
Well, it's a double bluff, in't it?

32:54.930 --> 32:56.488
Plus, she had no choice.

32:56.530 --> 32:59.920
No, that's bollocks, Frank.
The reason she told you

32:59.970 --> 33:01.528
is because she trusts you.

33:01.570 --> 33:04.209
That woman, she wouldn't
lay a finger on you.

33:04.250 --> 33:08.448
Fuck knows why, but she thinks
the sun shines out of your arse.

33:08.490 --> 33:11.288
But she's still
a fucking murderer, Kev.

33:11.330 --> 33:12.558
l'm not marrying her.

33:17.010 --> 33:18.807
lt's beautiful, in't it?

33:18.850 --> 33:20.568
l thought l might as well put it on,

33:20.610 --> 33:22.919
though l don't s'pose
l'll be needing it now.

33:22.970 --> 33:23.959
Hey now, come on. Enough of that.

33:24.010 --> 33:27.605
He knows, doesn't he?
He knows about Sheldon.

33:27.650 --> 33:28.878
l'm sorry, Sheila...

33:28.930 --> 33:30.921
He used to hit me.

33:30.970 --> 33:33.723
lf everything wasn't
just so, he used to...

33:33.770 --> 33:37.319
lt was like he was looking
for things to find fault with.

33:37.370 --> 33:42.000
Like, if his records weren't stacked
neatly or if l had a button undone.

33:42.050 --> 33:44.644
Sheldon fucking beat you?

33:44.690 --> 33:47.158
l was young.
You think you deserve it, don't you?

33:47.210 --> 33:51.886
You don't know any better.
lt was the gold that was the worst.

33:51.930 --> 33:53.522
He used to burn me with it,

33:53.570 --> 33:56.403
pattern marks all up and
down me arms and legs.

34:04.930 --> 34:08.400
And if l cried,
he'd punch me in the face.

34:08.449 --> 34:12.806
Battered me once, put
me in hospital for a month.

34:12.850 --> 34:14.329
Why didn't anybody stop him?

34:14.370 --> 34:16.042
Why didn't you go to the police?

34:16.090 --> 34:19.127
l did, but they used to pretend
they couldn't see the marks.

34:19.170 --> 34:21.161
They just used to
say, ''There, there,''

34:21.210 --> 34:23.405
give me a boiled sweet
and send me home.

34:23.449 --> 34:26.168
They used to call it a
domestic in those days.

34:26.210 --> 34:28.518
They didn't wanna get involved.

34:28.570 --> 34:30.764
lt was always gobstoppers.

34:30.810 --> 34:33.404
Can't stand the sight of them now.

34:35.969 --> 34:41.123
And then one night, he was coming at me
with the medallion.

34:42.170 --> 34:44.001
l just went...

34:51.210 --> 34:53.565
l didn't plan any of it.

34:53.610 --> 34:55.362
Oh, Sheila. What a bastard!

34:55.409 --> 34:58.880
l can't believe you've
never told us before!

34:58.930 --> 35:01.205
He deserved everything he got then.

35:01.250 --> 35:03.320
You mustn't waste
another breath on him.

35:03.370 --> 35:05.088
But Frank's gone, Veronica.

35:05.130 --> 35:06.802
Because of me.
Because of what l've done.

35:06.850 --> 35:08.283
Hey now, come on, that's...

35:08.330 --> 35:11.879
Do you think maybe if l
confessed, do you think

35:11.930 --> 35:13.488
maybe Frank could forgive me?

35:13.530 --> 35:15.248
l know he doesn't love me any more,

35:15.290 --> 35:17.406
but if he could forgive me, that
would be something, wouldn't it?

35:17.450 --> 35:20.010
You are not getting yourself

35:20.050 --> 35:22.769
banged up for the likes of Sheldon.
He was a monster.

35:22.810 --> 35:23.845
But for Frank. >

35:23.890 --> 35:28.566
He's the best thing that's ever
happened to me!

35:28.610 --> 35:31.078
l'm gonna turn myself in.

35:39.530 --> 35:41.600
Oi! Having a nice time, are yer?

35:41.650 --> 35:43.606
While your fiancee's
gone to turn herself in?

35:45.890 --> 35:47.767
lf you can't do the time...

35:47.810 --> 35:52.486
For the murder of a bloke who
beat her to a fucking pulp!

35:52.530 --> 35:55.124
Oi! Where the fuck you going?!

35:55.170 --> 35:57.161
Empty house.
Gonna keep meself company.

35:58.730 --> 36:01.369
For fuck's sake, Frank, he used
to burn her fucking arms

36:01.450 --> 36:04.010
with a medallion! How
much more convincing do you need?!

36:04.050 --> 36:06.883
l am not fucking joking, Frank!

36:06.930 --> 36:10.400
You can't let her go through
with this! She'll go to prison!

36:10.450 --> 36:13.283
She's only confessing cos she thinks
it's what you want!

36:16.090 --> 36:17.682
Fucking hell.

36:17.730 --> 36:18.719
What?

36:18.770 --> 36:21.079
Mr and Mrs Gallagher.

36:21.130 --> 36:24.725
She's opened a fucking joint account
for you.

36:42.850 --> 36:46.320
What's he doing?! Get off!
What you doing?!

36:54.170 --> 36:56.047
For fuck's sake!

37:29.290 --> 37:31.440
Sergeant.

37:31.490 --> 37:33.208
Thank you.

37:36.850 --> 37:39.080
Blimey, look at you, Sheila!

37:39.130 --> 37:41.769
Ah, the twins have grown, eh?

37:41.810 --> 37:43.528
< Yeah, they have.

37:43.570 --> 37:46.289
So, what can we do for you?

37:46.330 --> 37:47.968
You come to report a crime?
What is it?

37:48.010 --> 37:50.444
Frank wants to wear his
Hawaiian shirt for the wedding?!

37:50.490 --> 37:52.526
No.

37:53.570 --> 37:54.844
< l've come to confess...

37:56.090 --> 37:58.320
..to a murder.

38:02.170 --> 38:03.398
l'm sorry.

38:07.450 --> 38:10.840
Sheila, you don't have
to marry Frank if you

38:10.890 --> 38:12.881
don't want to. You don't
have to go making up stories.

38:12.930 --> 38:14.807
No, l do! l really do.

38:14.850 --> 38:17.683
lt's just cos
of the conservatory, you see?

38:20.410 --> 38:21.968
All right.

38:22.010 --> 38:23.728
Maybe we should, erm...

38:23.770 --> 38:24.839
We'll get you a cup of tea.

38:24.890 --> 38:27.358
Yeah, that'd be lovely.

38:27.410 --> 38:29.924
With Demerara, if you've got it.

38:31.370 --> 38:33.088
- Gob-stopper?
- No.

38:33.130 --> 38:36.247
Whoa, Neddy!
Hold the fucking horses.

38:36.370 --> 38:39.089
Whatever she's saying
it's not true, right?!

38:39.130 --> 38:41.849
lt's just pre-wedding
jitters, isn't it?

38:46.930 --> 38:51.481
Can l just have a couple
of minutes with her on me own?

38:56.090 --> 38:59.446
Sheila!
What you doing, you daft mare?!

38:59.490 --> 39:03.244
l know you know about him,
what l've done,

39:03.290 --> 39:05.724
so l thought l'd come
and get it off me chest.

39:05.770 --> 39:07.806
What you talking about?

39:07.850 --> 39:11.320
He was a brute, wasn't he?
Veronica told me.

39:11.370 --> 39:13.964
He deserved everything he got.

39:14.010 --> 39:16.365
lf l'd have got to him
first, l'd have done it!

39:16.410 --> 39:19.208
lf anyone lays
a fucking finger on you...

39:19.250 --> 39:21.889
Frank, you'd gone
because of what l'd done.

39:21.930 --> 39:23.249
No!

39:23.290 --> 39:26.726
Well, yeah, but it was just...

39:28.290 --> 39:30.008
You know, just a...

39:30.050 --> 39:35.841
moment of cold feet!
Just a normal kind of blokes' thing.

39:35.890 --> 39:39.166
l got a bit...
Anyway, the point is, l'm here now!

39:39.210 --> 39:43.169
Why don't we just go home, eh?

39:43.890 --> 39:48.168
To tell you the truth,
you finding out's quite a weight off.

39:49.730 --> 39:53.086
l've been giving it a lot of thought,
and l've thought

39:53.130 --> 39:56.247
maybe all this trouble
l've had over the last few years,

39:56.290 --> 40:00.681
you know, the pills and everything,
maybe it's cos of the guilt.

40:02.410 --> 40:04.878
l think l need to be punished.

40:06.810 --> 40:09.563
Sheila, you have

40:09.610 --> 40:11.965
served your time.

40:14.970 --> 40:16.961
ln here.

40:18.970 --> 40:22.519
So what good's it gonna do?
lt's not gonna bring him back, is it?

40:22.570 --> 40:27.246
- But Frank...
- l'll tell you something, if you go to prison...

40:27.290 --> 40:30.123
lf you go to prison,

40:30.170 --> 40:32.206
you will kill another man,

40:32.250 --> 40:34.400
because...

40:36.850 --> 40:39.523
l will die of a broken heart.

40:42.530 --> 40:45.203
Frank, do you really mean that?

40:46.810 --> 40:49.005
Do l?

40:59.810 --> 41:01.766
A man

41:01.810 --> 41:04.324
without a woman...

41:09.610 --> 41:11.168
Sheila Jackson...

41:15.130 --> 41:19.806
..will you do me
the great thingy

41:19.850 --> 41:23.559
of being my wife?

41:23.610 --> 41:25.566
Oh, yes!

41:26.570 --> 41:28.765
Yes, course l will!

41:28.810 --> 41:30.801
Of course l will!

41:34.130 --> 41:36.519
Let's get the fuck
out of this place, then.

41:45.410 --> 41:47.719
Well, you don't scrub up bad.

41:47.770 --> 41:50.238
l didn't think you were coming.

41:50.290 --> 41:52.201
Wouldn't miss this, would l?

41:52.250 --> 41:56.038
l got me mum to mind Katie.
So, it's just me and you today.

41:56.090 --> 41:58.604
lf we can remember how to do that.

41:58.650 --> 42:01.881
Course we can. Come on.

42:02.770 --> 42:03.725
You got a buttonhole, Marty?

42:03.770 --> 42:05.123
Nick a cock in it!

42:05.170 --> 42:06.842
Hiya, Karen.

42:06.890 --> 42:08.323
Hiya, Sue.

42:08.370 --> 42:09.849
Here you are, love.

42:11.450 --> 42:15.648
ln a civil service, we don't
make vows of a religious nature.

42:15.690 --> 42:17.760
Thank fuck.

42:17.810 --> 42:19.528
But we pledge our love,
honour and respect

42:19.570 --> 42:23.279
in a way that's just as deeply binding.

42:23.330 --> 42:27.084
Come on, get to the good bit!
''Do you, Vernon Francis Gallagher...''

42:27.130 --> 42:28.927
Join in if you know the words.

42:28.970 --> 42:30.403
Do you...

42:30.450 --> 42:35.001
(All) ..Vernon Francis Gallagher,
take Sheila Jackson to be

42:35.050 --> 42:38.326
your lawfully wedded wife?

42:38.650 --> 42:40.606
l do!

42:40.650 --> 42:44.086
And do you, Sheila Jackson...

42:44.130 --> 42:49.250
(All) ..take Vernon Francis Gallagher
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

42:49.290 --> 42:51.850
Yes! Yeah! l'm guilty!

42:51.890 --> 42:54.165
Hurray! Here's the ring!

42:56.650 --> 43:00.438
l now pronounce you husband and wife.

43:00.490 --> 43:02.560
Wahey!

43:04.850 --> 43:06.329
< Way to go, Frank!

43:06.370 --> 43:10.363
Congratulations and celebrations

43:10.410 --> 43:16.087
When l tell everyone
that you're in love with me

43:16.130 --> 43:20.999
Congratulations
and jubilations...

43:21.050 --> 43:23.086
Hey. l'm glad you came through.

43:23.130 --> 43:25.439
Well, l could hardly
let her down, could l?

43:25.490 --> 43:28.448
Anyway, l got to thinking,
l never got the divorce through

43:28.490 --> 43:31.960
from Monica in the end,
so it's not legal, anyway.

43:44.650 --> 43:46.641
< Mr and Mrs Gallagher.

43:49.090 --> 43:52.480
(Frank) 'So, l've got a new joke.
What does ''bigamy'' mean?

43:52.530 --> 43:54.202
'One wife too many.

43:54.250 --> 43:57.048
'And ''monogamy''? Same fucking thing.

43:57.090 --> 43:59.365
'But if you've gotta
have a ball and chain,

43:59.410 --> 44:01.401
'Sheila's the woman for the job.

44:01.450 --> 44:05.363
'lf we ever fall on hard times,
we can send her out as a contract killer.

44:05.410 --> 44:08.402
'So, like the chief Roman
said, ''Veni, vidi, vol-au-vent.''

44:08.450 --> 44:10.168
'Let's have a fucking party!'
