WEBVTT

00:14.155 --> 00:16.312
Got 10 minutes before
Ainsley comes looking for me.

00:16.407 --> 00:18.400
So what's the big emergency?

00:18.493 --> 00:20.948
- No one can know about this.
- Okay.

00:21.037 --> 00:22.864
We haven't got much time.

00:22.955 --> 00:25.743
I was repositioning
from Cuba up towards Quebec,

00:26.292 --> 00:28.285
guess it hit a glitch over Virginia.

00:29.670 --> 00:31.414
Little Creek Naval Base.

00:37.178 --> 00:38.921
God bless America.

00:39.347 --> 00:41.802
- She's really cold.
- Really. Cold.

00:41.891 --> 00:44.560
Better than monitoring
ship movements in the Atlantic.

00:44.644 --> 00:46.435
As long as we don't get caught.

00:49.065 --> 00:51.734
- A problem.
- Someone else must be there.

00:54.987 --> 00:57.739
Damn. No, no, no, sweetie.
Nobody's looking.

01:08.209 --> 01:10.000
All right. All right.

01:10.294 --> 01:11.954
Where'd she go?

01:19.846 --> 01:21.637
What just happened?

01:24.267 --> 01:25.547
Punch in.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.543
Good morning, Kate.

02:23.760 --> 02:25.717
I assume that was good morning.

02:25.804 --> 02:27.927
- You want one?
- No. Thanks.

02:28.223 --> 02:30.381
- Really good.
- Not worth the price.

02:30.475 --> 02:33.559
I like keeping my belt notched
exactly where it is.

02:34.938 --> 02:37.226
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What mean?

02:37.565 --> 02:39.772
The whole sort of
raised-eyebrows, winky thing.

02:39.859 --> 02:43.275
Nothing, really. Just a nervous tic.

02:44.155 --> 02:46.876
I've weighed exactly the same
since the day I graduated from college.

02:46.950 --> 02:49.357
- Never up, never down.
- Certainly you would know.

02:49.452 --> 02:52.287
- Do you weigh yourself a lot?
- I never weigh myself.

02:52.372 --> 02:53.451
I see.

02:53.540 --> 02:57.158
Well, I don't pay
that close attention to your body, Tony.

02:57.877 --> 02:59.075
Really?

03:00.130 --> 03:03.249
But, Tony, if you're happy
with the way you are,

03:03.341 --> 03:05.250
that's all that counts.

03:08.763 --> 03:09.926
Gibbs.

03:15.103 --> 03:17.724
We've got a murder at Little Creek.
Get Ducky.

03:23.403 --> 03:24.945
You all right?

03:25.363 --> 03:26.988
I couldn't be better.

03:36.082 --> 03:37.245
Who found the body?

03:37.333 --> 03:40.287
I did. An anonymous tip
was called in to base security

03:40.378 --> 03:42.121
saying someone was stabbed here.

03:42.213 --> 03:43.494
Victim been I.D.'d?

03:43.590 --> 03:46.425
Yes, sir.
Lieutenant Commander Thomas Egan.

03:46.509 --> 03:48.965
His wallet was found in the SUV.

03:49.971 --> 03:52.592
- Kate, photos.
- Got it.

03:52.682 --> 03:53.761
Tag Heuer.

03:53.850 --> 03:56.555
You don't leave one of those behind
if you're robbing a guy.

03:57.353 --> 03:59.476
You know the
Lieutenant Commander's assignment?

03:59.564 --> 04:03.562
Yes, sir. He's attached
as a technical advisor to Side-Scan.

04:04.360 --> 04:06.768
A civilian contractor on the base.

04:06.863 --> 04:09.401
Don't know any more.
Their work's classified.

04:09.991 --> 04:13.158
- Keep this under wraps, Master Chief.
- Yes, sir.

04:15.955 --> 04:18.873
- We have a rising tide.
- Okay.

04:18.958 --> 04:20.036
- DiNozzo?
- Yo.

04:20.125 --> 04:23.744
You and me take measurements.
We'll rebuild them later in the lab.

04:23.838 --> 04:25.961
- Kate, more photos!
- Gotcha.

04:27.508 --> 04:29.667
- Gerald, take notes.
- I'm on it.

04:30.637 --> 04:33.507
Come on, move it!
We gotta keep him dry.

04:35.099 --> 04:36.344
I've got the sign.

04:36.517 --> 04:38.012
I've got the farthest boulder.

04:42.398 --> 04:43.893
Head and feet!

04:44.734 --> 04:46.014
15.71.

04:46.110 --> 04:47.937
11.36 metres.

04:48.029 --> 04:50.354
15.71.11.36. Got them.

04:51.532 --> 04:53.240
His dive knife is missing.

04:53.326 --> 04:57.026
Yeah, you didn't see this coming,
did you, my friend?

04:57.872 --> 04:59.414
Hey, watch out!

04:59.499 --> 05:00.661
Tide!

05:07.715 --> 05:09.340
Well done, Tony.

05:10.551 --> 05:11.832
Bag him.

05:12.845 --> 05:15.882
I've got a spare suit in the van.

05:18.893 --> 05:20.352
Are you okay?

05:21.938 --> 05:23.397
What is it?

05:23.731 --> 05:25.107
Shrinkage.

05:30.863 --> 05:33.271
I just can't believe Tom Egan is dead.

05:34.242 --> 05:36.318
When did you see him last?

05:37.078 --> 05:38.738
Early this morning.

05:38.830 --> 05:40.407
Where was the commander going?

05:40.498 --> 05:43.748
To conduct underwater tests
on a piece of equipment.

05:45.003 --> 05:47.576
Did you find a device with his body?

05:47.964 --> 05:49.244
What kind of a device?

05:51.926 --> 05:53.966
It's a handheld sonar gun.

05:54.053 --> 05:57.588
I've got a wooden mockup
of the prototype that we're missing.

05:57.682 --> 06:00.599
It uses sound echoes
to create visual images.

06:01.394 --> 06:02.557
Like a sonogram.

06:02.645 --> 06:04.270
- Yeah.
- Not dissimilar.

06:04.355 --> 06:07.142
Earlier types are larger,
have to be towed behind watercraft.

06:07.233 --> 06:09.771
And our version
can be carried by a diver.

06:09.861 --> 06:12.530
My company developed the concept.
We brought it to the Navy.

06:12.613 --> 06:14.939
Commander Tyler
was assigned as my liaison.

06:15.033 --> 06:18.615
I brought in Tom.
He was a sound-surveillance expert.

06:19.412 --> 06:20.954
We were evaluating it.

06:21.039 --> 06:23.327
For use in harbour surveillance.

06:23.666 --> 06:24.697
Yes.

06:25.543 --> 06:27.701
It's the only working prototype
that we have.

06:27.795 --> 06:31.045
Its loss is just devastating
to the military.

06:31.632 --> 06:33.958
And, I bet, to your company.

06:35.470 --> 06:38.139
- Where's the commander's desk?
- There.

06:40.141 --> 06:44.139
We're seizing his computer,
and anything else we find we need.

06:46.606 --> 06:48.148
You understand.

06:49.817 --> 06:50.897
Little Creek quarter deck.

06:50.985 --> 06:52.626
This is Seaman Apprentice
Sparks speaking.

06:52.653 --> 06:55.524
How may I help you, sir, ma'am?
Yes, sir.

06:58.993 --> 07:00.902
Special Agent DiNozzo.

07:01.162 --> 07:03.831
Just can't stop messing
with the uniforms, can they, sir?

07:05.124 --> 07:07.496
- You on duty this morning?
- Yes, sir.

07:07.585 --> 07:09.661
Take the call
about the attack on the beach?

07:09.754 --> 07:14.332
Yes, sir. Call came in at 0932.

07:14.634 --> 07:16.508
- Get a name?
- No, sir.

07:16.886 --> 07:19.840
But the voice was male.
Sounded real nervous.

07:19.931 --> 07:22.469
And when I started asking questions,
he just hung up.

07:25.061 --> 07:26.259
Caller I. D?

07:26.354 --> 07:27.516
Yes, sir.

07:27.605 --> 07:29.847
But the call that came in this morning
was blocked.

07:29.941 --> 07:32.858
Well, it shouldn't be too hard
for NCIS to trace that.

07:34.487 --> 07:36.195
I'd write a letter, sir.

07:47.458 --> 07:49.499
Come on! Come on, McGee!
You said you could do this.

07:49.585 --> 07:51.106
But I didn't say it was gonna be easy.

07:51.170 --> 07:52.648
Actually, that's exactly what you said,

07:52.672 --> 07:54.191
only on the phone
you ended it with a "sir".

07:54.215 --> 07:55.295
Well, that's when I thought

07:55.341 --> 07:57.444
you were talking about
going through the proper channels.

07:57.468 --> 07:58.927
Proper channels have too many bends.

07:59.011 --> 08:01.716
Well, lucky for you Little Creek
has its own central exchange.

08:01.806 --> 08:04.131
Otherwise, the proper channels
would be your only option.

08:04.225 --> 08:06.763
If I'm so lucky, then why haven't you
given me the number yet?

08:06.853 --> 08:09.522
The exchange handles
all incoming calls to the base.

08:09.605 --> 08:12.690
Do you have any idea how many calls
came into Little Creek at 0932?

08:12.775 --> 08:14.649
You know what my dad
always said about excuses?

08:14.735 --> 08:17.736
Yeah, they're like armpits.
Everybody has them and they all stink.

08:17.822 --> 08:19.591
Actually, he used
a different part of the anatomy,

08:19.615 --> 08:20.695
but you got the main idea.

08:22.910 --> 08:25.745
So whatever happened
between you and Abby?

08:25.872 --> 08:29.038
- Our paths still cross on occasion.
- Really?

08:29.459 --> 08:31.747
I guess the tat on the old caboose
did the trick.

08:31.836 --> 08:33.414
Among other things.

08:33.504 --> 08:34.998
You don't say.

08:35.423 --> 08:37.499
Did you see any art on her caboose?

08:37.842 --> 08:39.881
You're right, I don't say.

08:39.969 --> 08:41.344
I'll take that as a no.

08:44.140 --> 08:45.219
Found it.

08:45.308 --> 08:48.558
See, the new SS-7 data circuits,
they block display of the number.

08:48.644 --> 08:52.096
But the calling party number message
is still carried on the line.

08:52.190 --> 08:53.459
I don't know what you just said.

08:53.483 --> 08:55.890
I don't care what you just said.
Just give me the number.

08:57.069 --> 08:58.350
Why is there an asterisk?

09:00.490 --> 09:01.735
I'm not sure.

09:04.118 --> 09:05.197
Sir?

09:05.286 --> 09:06.566
That wasn't an "add a sir" look.

09:06.662 --> 09:08.738
That was
a "you'd better find out why" look.

09:08.831 --> 09:09.910
Oh.

09:10.124 --> 09:11.287
It's all right.

09:11.501 --> 09:13.043
Rookie mistake.

09:24.430 --> 09:26.719
Egan and his wife
have been married for nine years.

09:26.807 --> 09:29.014
They met when they were stationed
in San Diego.

09:29.101 --> 09:30.596
- Any kids?
- No.

09:31.270 --> 09:32.515
Oh, my God.

09:32.605 --> 09:34.432
It's their anniversary next week.

09:38.110 --> 09:39.630
It looks like the Navy was pretty good

09:39.654 --> 09:41.314
about stationing them
at the same bases.

09:41.405 --> 09:43.363
How long have they been here
in Little Creek?

09:43.449 --> 09:45.323
Egan was transferred here in March

09:45.409 --> 09:48.992
and his wife had to finish assignment
in Panama City, Florida.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.622
Then followed four months later.

09:50.706 --> 09:54.122
No matter how many times I do this,
it never gets any easier.

09:54.210 --> 09:56.748
We should have had
DiNozzo handle this interview.

09:58.047 --> 09:59.458
Just kidding.

10:01.175 --> 10:02.800
Lieutenant Egan?

10:03.511 --> 10:04.791
NCIS.

10:07.098 --> 10:10.965
I'm aware there's probably a better time
to be doing all this.

10:12.603 --> 10:15.059
Where were you
coming home from, Lieutenant?

10:17.066 --> 10:19.308
Camp Lejeune for the weekend.

10:19.402 --> 10:21.774
It was a human resources seminar.

10:21.862 --> 10:25.646
When I got home the base commander
and the chaplain were here

10:25.741 --> 10:27.236
and I knew...

10:27.785 --> 10:29.943
When was the last time
you spoke to your husband?

10:30.037 --> 10:31.366
Last night.

10:31.539 --> 10:32.867
What time?

10:33.833 --> 10:35.078
I don't know.

10:35.167 --> 10:36.728
Yeah, but if you could try to remember...

10:36.752 --> 10:37.915
I don't know!

10:40.923 --> 10:42.299
Lieutenant,

10:43.509 --> 10:45.300
I know this is hard.

10:46.554 --> 10:47.752
Sorry!

10:52.852 --> 10:54.346
Around 10:00.

10:54.604 --> 10:56.181
Before I went to bed.

10:56.272 --> 10:58.146
Did you know that
he was going diving today?

10:59.984 --> 11:01.644
But he went diving

11:02.278 --> 11:04.187
many times during the week.

11:04.280 --> 11:05.822
He was a SEAL.

11:06.198 --> 11:07.574
He was decorated.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.240
Did he tell you what he was working on?

11:10.328 --> 11:12.486
No, Tom was very strict
about need-to-know.

11:13.539 --> 11:16.291
He didn't discuss his work with anyone.
Not even me.

11:18.836 --> 11:21.042
Would you do the honours,
please, Gerald?

11:21.130 --> 11:22.458
Sure thing.

11:26.719 --> 11:28.712
- What?
- It moved.

11:29.639 --> 11:31.181
I don't think so.

11:31.265 --> 11:32.428
It moved, Doc.

11:32.516 --> 11:35.683
Remind me to check our inventory
of alcohol swab.

11:42.902 --> 11:45.025
He certainly was dead on the beach.

12:00.461 --> 12:03.248
What do you think, Kate? Espionage?

12:03.381 --> 12:05.005
A Navy specialist is murdered

12:05.091 --> 12:07.152
and the classified device
he has with him is missing.

12:07.176 --> 12:08.919
- It looks that way.
- Yeah.

12:09.762 --> 12:11.221
Oh, my God.

12:12.807 --> 12:14.052
Don't even, okay?

12:14.141 --> 12:16.264
- Did I say anything?
- You were. I know you were.

12:16.894 --> 12:21.141
Well, it's... You know, a touch small,
but other than that it's fine.

12:21.524 --> 12:23.433
And the bonus, no belt.

12:24.068 --> 12:26.440
DiNozzo. The anonymous tip?

12:26.529 --> 12:28.189
It came from a restricted phone.

12:28.280 --> 12:30.688
- Area code 703.
- Langley, Virginia.

12:30.783 --> 12:31.946
CIA.

12:32.284 --> 12:33.447
Wow, huh?

12:34.870 --> 12:36.068
Yeah.

12:43.212 --> 12:44.492
It's okay.

12:44.588 --> 12:46.747
Got it, Tony. Don't you worry.

12:46.924 --> 12:49.332
Wouldn't wanna disturb your lunch.

12:49.593 --> 12:51.503
You got me thinking, Kate.

12:51.595 --> 12:53.671
Maybe I should improve my diet.

12:54.765 --> 12:56.259
When are you going to start?

12:56.350 --> 12:57.513
What do you call this?

12:57.601 --> 13:00.223
Bad things masquerading
as something good for you?

13:00.855 --> 13:03.061
This is a nutrition bar.
It says so on the label.

13:03.190 --> 13:04.815
Yeah. Did you read the label?

13:04.900 --> 13:06.858
A little... You know,
one with the ingredients

13:06.944 --> 13:08.704
not just the big one
with the pretty colours?

13:08.779 --> 13:10.819
Sarcasm is so not healthy, Kate.

13:10.906 --> 13:13.029
Neither is that. Let's see.

13:13.367 --> 13:16.036
We've got here,
high fructose corn syrup.

13:16.120 --> 13:17.698
Basically sugar.

13:18.289 --> 13:21.325
High maltose corn syrup.
Another sugar.

13:21.917 --> 13:23.542
Sugar. Sugar.

13:23.878 --> 13:27.294
Fractionated palm kernel oil.
That sounds yummy!

13:27.882 --> 13:30.717
And contains
less than 2% natural flavour.

13:30.801 --> 13:34.550
That would make it
98% artificial flavour.

13:35.306 --> 13:36.504
What are you saying?

13:36.599 --> 13:40.181
So I hear Egan's computer is waiting
to get up close and personal with me.

13:40.269 --> 13:42.677
Be gentle.
I'm sure Tony will be more than happy

13:42.772 --> 13:44.266
to lug this downstairs for you.

13:44.356 --> 13:46.064
He's feeling healthy today.

13:49.653 --> 13:51.029
No problem.

13:51.238 --> 13:52.649
Thanks, Tony.

13:53.949 --> 13:55.230
Where's Gibbs?

13:55.326 --> 13:58.196
With director Morrow. He's trying
to get a meeting with the CIA.

13:58.579 --> 13:59.610
Why?

13:59.705 --> 14:01.745
That's where the anonymous phone call
came from.

14:01.832 --> 14:04.750
Langley is like 200 miles
from Little Creek.

14:04.835 --> 14:05.955
That doesn't make any sense.

14:06.003 --> 14:08.023
Especially considering
Ducky established time of death

14:08.047 --> 14:09.956
was approximately 9:30.

14:10.049 --> 14:12.088
And the tip was phoned in at 9:32.

14:12.176 --> 14:13.291
It's impossible.

14:13.385 --> 14:16.719
It isn't if someone from the CIA
was watching on a high-def satellite.

14:21.602 --> 14:25.351
You're accusing the agency of spying
on a U.S. Naval station.

14:25.481 --> 14:27.272
Do you have a better explanation?

14:27.358 --> 14:29.267
It didn't happen, Agent Gibbs.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.436
I have a dead Lieutenant Commander,

14:31.529 --> 14:33.521
and missing classified hardware

14:33.614 --> 14:36.817
and a phone call that originated
from this building right after the murder.

14:36.909 --> 14:39.614
I'm not denying we have the capability.

14:39.912 --> 14:43.328
But you know as well as I do that
it would be a violation of CIA mandate

14:43.415 --> 14:44.791
to operate domestically.

14:44.875 --> 14:45.990
Right.

14:46.126 --> 14:48.700
Well, you never do anything illegal?

14:52.216 --> 14:55.170
We have the same uncle
writing our paycheques.

14:56.095 --> 14:57.969
We do what we do

14:58.556 --> 15:00.299
to get the job done.

15:01.016 --> 15:03.507
I appreciate the sentiment, Agent Gibbs.

15:03.602 --> 15:05.310
I don't have the need-to-know

15:05.396 --> 15:07.721
to know why you have
a satellite pointed at Little Creek.

15:08.983 --> 15:10.975
I have a murder to solve.

15:11.151 --> 15:13.109
I could use your help.

15:13.487 --> 15:16.239
There's nothing I can do to help you,
Agent Gibbs.

15:18.284 --> 15:20.027
If you'll excuse me.

15:26.417 --> 15:27.531
You're on the air!

15:27.626 --> 15:29.168
- Hey, Abs.
- Gibbs,

15:29.253 --> 15:30.664
how did we do with the moles?

15:31.005 --> 15:32.997
Spooks, Abby. Spooks.

15:33.674 --> 15:35.465
I can never get that straight.

15:35.551 --> 15:37.674
Are you still in touch
with that old NASA boyfriend?

15:37.761 --> 15:40.169
He wasn't a boyfriend.
He was a boy-toy.

15:40.264 --> 15:43.218
And yes, we I.M. Almost every day.

15:43.726 --> 15:45.718
- You do?
- Oh, yeah.

15:46.520 --> 15:49.225
- That's good, right?
- It's very good.

15:50.608 --> 15:51.687
Why?

15:54.278 --> 15:56.733
Greetings from NASA, NCIS.

15:57.364 --> 15:59.855
Whoa. Ashton, that was so Star Trek.

16:00.117 --> 16:01.148
Sorry I'm late.

16:01.243 --> 16:03.930
I had a cluster of frozen reactor coolant
heading for the flight path

16:03.954 --> 16:05.863
of an Atlas lift-off.
I had to delay the launch.

16:05.956 --> 16:07.415
They were not happy about it.

16:07.499 --> 16:11.118
I am, however,
very happy to see you, Abby,

16:11.211 --> 16:14.960
and to help your NCIS
crime-fighting colleagues.

16:15.716 --> 16:17.091
You're the best, Ashton.

16:17.468 --> 16:18.630
You are, Ab.

16:18.719 --> 16:19.882
Thank you.

16:20.262 --> 16:22.670
- We really should talk.
- We really should talk.

16:22.765 --> 16:24.757
Special Agent Gibbs here.

16:25.434 --> 16:26.549
Of course.

16:26.644 --> 16:28.435
Appreciate your help.

16:28.854 --> 16:32.057
We're looking for sat activity
yesterday about

16:32.232 --> 16:34.308
0930 Eastern Standard.

16:34.735 --> 16:36.110
Roger that.

16:36.445 --> 16:37.608
Geostationary?

16:37.696 --> 16:38.727
Asynchronous.

16:38.822 --> 16:40.482
- Multi-positional?
- Very.

16:40.574 --> 16:41.653
Landsat 7?

16:41.742 --> 16:42.987
Think CIA.

16:43.410 --> 16:44.442
KH-12.

16:44.536 --> 16:45.699
Improved crystal.

16:45.788 --> 16:47.365
Thermal infrared.

16:47.456 --> 16:48.915
It gets hot down here.

16:50.417 --> 16:51.449
Target area?

16:51.543 --> 16:53.086
Virginia coast.

16:54.672 --> 16:55.751
We have entry.

16:56.215 --> 16:58.254
You're so good, Ashton.

16:59.301 --> 17:01.923
Any idea what department
it came from?

17:02.262 --> 17:05.133
It's a pretty sophisticated
blocking system on the KH-12.

17:05.223 --> 17:07.974
I'm afraid that task
is a bit more complicated.

17:08.894 --> 17:11.266
Complicated, but not impossible.

17:11.355 --> 17:15.648
They overlooked the same technology
on the Milstar satellite relays

17:18.112 --> 17:21.563
and that particular satellite
is controlled from

17:21.949 --> 17:24.784
building 35-C, office 409.

17:24.867 --> 17:26.279
Bravo, Ashton!

17:29.707 --> 17:31.498
We're lucky
Abby could get in the system

17:31.583 --> 17:33.184
and pull his name off the office number.

17:33.210 --> 17:34.490
There's not much on him.

17:34.586 --> 17:36.544
CIA's not big on bios.

17:36.630 --> 17:38.290
Jeremy Wirth, 23.

17:38.799 --> 17:41.551
Current address,
35-B Maple, Georgetown.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.504
Graduated MIT at 20.

17:44.972 --> 17:46.466
I'm impressed.

17:47.474 --> 17:51.472
Been with the agency six months.
Working as a satellite analyst.

17:51.729 --> 17:53.187
That's all we got.

17:53.272 --> 17:57.270
Why would they use someone so green
on such a covert assignment?

17:57.526 --> 18:01.144
- Too bad we don't have a photo.
- Don't need one. He'll fit the profile.

18:02.114 --> 18:03.489
A bit geeky, right?

18:03.574 --> 18:05.566
Well, yeah, Kate, something like that.

18:07.286 --> 18:10.156
Have you ever seen Robert Redford
in Three Days of the Condor?

18:10.247 --> 18:12.489
- Yes.
- That's a geek I could get covert with.

18:12.583 --> 18:15.156
Kate, I would not get my hopes up.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.379
Check it out.

18:24.011 --> 18:25.173
Jeremy?

18:27.514 --> 18:28.925
Do I know you?

18:29.016 --> 18:31.008
My name's Kate. Kate Todd.

18:31.685 --> 18:33.345
Can I talk to you?

18:33.645 --> 18:35.056
About what?

18:36.482 --> 18:39.933
- What's NCIS?
- Naval Criminal Investigative Service.

18:40.027 --> 18:43.360
- I've got nothing to talk to you about.
- I'm Special Agent Gibbs.

18:43.530 --> 18:46.021
Same agency
you haven't heard of before.

18:46.116 --> 18:49.366
- Only I don't take it personally anymore.
- I've got to go inside.

18:49.453 --> 18:50.698
We know where you work, Jeremy.

18:50.788 --> 18:53.705
We suspect you're the one that
called Little Creek about the stabbing.

18:53.791 --> 18:55.830
You need to tell us what you saw.

18:56.376 --> 18:57.954
I can't say anything.

18:58.045 --> 19:01.877
Did the Assistant Director Rober
have a little chat with you?

19:01.965 --> 19:05.216
He put me on administrative leave.
I'm under investigation.

19:06.678 --> 19:08.636
- Rober didn't know.
- No.

19:09.807 --> 19:12.476
You were using the satellite
without their knowledge.

19:12.559 --> 19:15.679
Why were you watching
Lieutenant Commander Egan?

19:16.605 --> 19:17.684
Who?

19:17.981 --> 19:20.472
The Naval Officer who was murdered.

19:21.568 --> 19:25.400
You play ball with me,
I can square it with Rober.

19:27.699 --> 19:28.980
You can do that?

19:29.076 --> 19:31.448
With the exception
of finding a decent barber,

19:31.537 --> 19:34.454
Gibbs can do pretty much anything
he says he can.

19:34.540 --> 19:35.702
I was watching...

19:35.791 --> 19:38.116
Not... I wasn't watching the guy
in the wetsuit.

19:38.210 --> 19:40.499
I was watching something else

19:40.587 --> 19:44.039
and happened to notice
activity at the edge of the screen.

19:44.591 --> 19:46.631
What kind of something else
would this be?

19:46.718 --> 19:47.963
A person.

19:48.595 --> 19:50.137
Female person?

19:50.931 --> 19:52.010
Yeah.

19:52.432 --> 19:54.888
Kind of a babe female person?

19:55.102 --> 19:56.477
Really hot.

19:58.063 --> 20:00.981
I stumbled across her by accident.
She was polar tanning.

20:03.110 --> 20:05.019
Nude winter sunbathing.

20:05.404 --> 20:06.946
Must get cold.

20:08.282 --> 20:09.740
She was, sir.

20:09.867 --> 20:14.445
And you think that's an appropriate use
for a billion-dollar satellite, Jeremy?

20:14.538 --> 20:17.373
I got a little off track
with my priorities.

20:17.499 --> 20:20.121
That happens
with hot babes sometimes.

20:20.335 --> 20:22.624
So you didn't see
who attacked Commander Egan?

20:22.713 --> 20:25.120
When I tried to go close,
the image pixilated.

20:25.215 --> 20:27.124
All I saw was him go down.

20:27.217 --> 20:30.254
Whoever it was ran off
before I could adjust the picture.

20:30.637 --> 20:31.835
And that's it?

20:31.930 --> 20:34.172
If I had access
to the agency's computer,

20:34.266 --> 20:36.305
I could show you exactly what I saw.

20:36.393 --> 20:40.438
All satellite transmissions are recorded
on a hard drive at Langley.

20:40.772 --> 20:42.397
What the hell are you up to, Gibbs?

20:42.482 --> 20:44.724
I want the recording
of the satellite transmission.

20:44.818 --> 20:46.396
I don't know what you're talking about.

20:46.486 --> 20:50.069
Well, let me put Mr Wirth on.
He can explain it to you.

20:50.782 --> 20:52.325
No, no! No!

20:55.454 --> 20:58.620
Your analyst was spying
on a U.S. Naval Base.

20:59.249 --> 21:00.364
You have Wirth?

21:00.459 --> 21:03.164
I'm not really sure what
congressional oversight committee

21:03.253 --> 21:04.831
he's gonna be spilling his guts to.

21:04.922 --> 21:08.125
I mean, there are so many
to choose from these days.

21:09.384 --> 21:11.044
How do we handle this?

21:12.387 --> 21:14.594
We'll be there in 15 minutes.

21:16.141 --> 21:18.347
Well, Commander, based on the width

21:18.435 --> 21:21.140
and the jagged lower edge
of the entry wound,

21:21.230 --> 21:24.314
it appears you were stabbed
with your own knife.

21:25.525 --> 21:29.938
The wound is consistent
with a serrated, titanium beta alloy knife

21:30.030 --> 21:32.023
missing from your sheath.

21:32.824 --> 21:35.362
And let's see what we've got here.

21:39.748 --> 21:41.326
Seven inches.

21:41.416 --> 21:43.872
Well, Gerald,
what have we learned from this?

21:43.961 --> 21:45.123
Seven inches.

21:45.212 --> 21:47.335
Yeah, it was a deep thrust.
Most of the blade.

21:47.422 --> 21:49.795
- And?
- And from the left to right angle.

21:49.883 --> 21:51.923
The assailant
was most likely left-handed.

21:52.010 --> 21:55.510
So we've vastly limited
the potential number of suspects.

21:55.597 --> 21:59.049
Only nine percent of the
world's population is left-handed.

21:59.142 --> 22:01.384
Interestingly, that percentage

22:01.561 --> 22:04.397
has remained the same
since prehistoric times.

22:04.481 --> 22:06.557
Archaeologists have been able
to determine this

22:06.650 --> 22:10.268
by examining cave paintings
more than 10,000 years old.

22:10.362 --> 22:12.070
Don't you think we should notify Gibbs?

22:12.906 --> 22:14.400
In due time.

22:15.534 --> 22:18.618
Curiously enough, the Yanomami tribe
in the Amazon

22:18.704 --> 22:20.827
are 23% left-handed.

22:27.254 --> 22:28.534
Find anything?

22:28.630 --> 22:31.038
Commander Egan's files
were password protected,

22:31.133 --> 22:33.090
it took me a while to get in.

22:34.928 --> 22:36.968
What, are you getting in shape?

22:37.055 --> 22:38.929
Yeah, you want to feel
how hard my forearm is?

22:39.016 --> 22:40.296
Look here. Look here.

22:40.392 --> 22:41.851
No, thanks. Hey, Gibbs.

22:41.935 --> 22:44.343
- You want to feel Tony's forearm?
- No, I'll pass.

22:44.438 --> 22:46.976
Copy of the CIA satellite transmission.

22:47.065 --> 22:48.746
I want to see
if you can enhance the image.

22:48.775 --> 22:50.317
Find anything in Egan's computer?

22:50.402 --> 22:53.438
He seemed hinky
about the sonar device's reliability.

22:53.530 --> 22:56.614
His notes suggest
that tests may have been altered.

22:56.700 --> 22:59.867
Think Egan was killed 'cause he was
gonna blow the whistle on the project?

23:01.038 --> 23:02.200
Maybe.

23:10.172 --> 23:11.749
I like this part.

23:23.185 --> 23:24.643
Do you think they'll find it?

23:25.645 --> 23:27.140
I don't know.

23:34.253 --> 23:37.005
This is the only time
the assailant is on the screen.

23:37.090 --> 23:39.925
Now watch what happens
when I try to go in.

23:40.134 --> 23:43.883
The closer I get to the figure,
the more the image distorts.

23:45.932 --> 23:47.094
That's it?

23:47.183 --> 23:48.298
Sorry, Gibbs.

23:48.393 --> 23:50.101
We can't make an I.D. Out of that.

23:51.020 --> 23:53.179
Maybe we can find the polar chick.

23:53.690 --> 23:55.148
Tony's right.

23:55.274 --> 23:58.026
The beach is on a naval base.
It's a restricted area.

23:58.111 --> 24:01.396
- Odds are she works at Little Creek.
- Want me to track her down, boss?

24:01.489 --> 24:03.398
Why am I not surprised?

24:03.741 --> 24:06.066
You want me to handle it?
At least I won't drool.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.240
No.

24:07.787 --> 24:10.195
No, DiNozzo took a wave for the team.

24:10.415 --> 24:11.873
Thanks, boss.

24:13.042 --> 24:16.411
Look at the muscle tone, would you?
Definition on those abs.

24:16.504 --> 24:18.544
The lady definitely works out a lot.

24:18.631 --> 24:21.751
- Maybe at the base gym?
- That makes sense.

24:21.926 --> 24:23.041
Don't hurt yourself.

24:23.136 --> 24:25.823
There's going to be a lot of dangerous
equipment you're not familiar with.

24:25.847 --> 24:27.305
That's cute, Kate.

24:27.640 --> 24:30.262
- Print me a copy, Abs?
- Face only, Abby.

24:31.185 --> 24:34.389
Kate, you stay with her.
Go over everything in Egan's file.

24:34.480 --> 24:37.434
Find out everything you can
about this device.

24:39.068 --> 24:40.266
Jethro!

24:43.614 --> 24:45.903
Jethro, while I was examining
our victim,

24:45.992 --> 24:48.281
I was telling Gerald
about the Yanomami tribe.

24:48.369 --> 24:49.698
He found it fascinating.

24:49.787 --> 24:51.863
- This would affect our case somehow?
- Of course.

24:51.956 --> 24:53.783
They were 23% left-handed.

24:53.875 --> 24:57.326
Lieutenant Commander Egan's killer
was left-handed.

24:57.420 --> 24:59.773
- Is there anything else?
- Well, he never made it into the ocean.

24:59.797 --> 25:01.589
That good fortune allowed me to find

25:01.674 --> 25:04.379
traces of someone else's DNA
on his body.

25:04.719 --> 25:06.510
The DNA of a female.

25:07.638 --> 25:09.714
That mean what I think it means, Duck?

25:10.725 --> 25:11.923
Look...

25:17.398 --> 25:19.023
Lieutenant Egan.

25:19.984 --> 25:21.941
If this is a bad time...

25:22.236 --> 25:24.988
I have to meet with the funeral director.

25:25.073 --> 25:28.027
I have a few questions.
Or I could come back.

25:28.659 --> 25:30.319
No. This is fine.

25:30.828 --> 25:34.446
Did your husband have doubts
about the project he was working on?

25:34.749 --> 25:37.418
I don't know.
He was pretty distant recently.

25:39.087 --> 25:41.126
Anything else bothering him?

25:41.214 --> 25:42.957
Not that I know of.

25:43.633 --> 25:45.460
He hated paying bills.

25:46.052 --> 25:48.294
Always gave him a stomachache.

25:48.971 --> 25:52.008
Do you know much about the people
at Side-Scan?

25:52.183 --> 25:55.303
Met them at a Christmas party
and couple of other times.

25:55.394 --> 25:57.470
He kept it pretty separate.

25:57.563 --> 26:00.137
Because of the confidential nature
of the project?

26:01.025 --> 26:02.270
I guess.

26:03.361 --> 26:06.231
He spent a lot of time at work,
didn't he?

26:06.614 --> 26:08.108
Not in the beginning.

26:09.867 --> 26:11.492
But that changed.

26:13.913 --> 26:15.822
In the last few months.

26:20.837 --> 26:24.537
He always said all he wanted
was a simple pine box.

26:25.967 --> 26:27.675
But I can't do that.

26:32.181 --> 26:33.426
I think

26:33.933 --> 26:37.598
that he'll be good
with whatever you pick out, Lieutenant.

27:04.338 --> 27:05.714
- Yeah?
- Hey.

27:06.048 --> 27:07.609
Sorry, I thought you were someone else.

27:08.968 --> 27:10.213
Just looking.

27:10.386 --> 27:13.055
You weren't sunbathing nude
on the beach yesterday, were you?

27:13.848 --> 27:16.054
- Nice try.
- I didn't think so.

27:19.520 --> 27:21.513
Hey, there. How you doing?

27:21.731 --> 27:23.522
Gym's for base personnel only.

27:23.608 --> 27:25.849
Well, I wasn't really planning
on working out.

27:25.943 --> 27:27.272
Obviously.

27:29.864 --> 27:32.355
Maybe you can help me. Seen her?

27:33.910 --> 27:36.745
- Not very clear.
- It's a really long lens.

27:37.747 --> 27:39.371
It could be Gina.

27:39.540 --> 27:40.619
Gina?

27:41.042 --> 27:44.826
Petty Officer Second.
Comes in here every day about noon.

27:45.213 --> 27:46.541
I'll wait.

28:06.567 --> 28:08.975
- You haven't found it.
- Not yet.

28:10.071 --> 28:13.072
You met me here
to get me away from Overmeyer.

28:15.785 --> 28:17.493
I've got questions.

28:17.578 --> 28:18.657
All right.

28:18.746 --> 28:22.364
What was Commander Egan
supposed to be doing that morning?

28:23.084 --> 28:25.207
Underwater test the device.

28:26.087 --> 28:27.201
Meaning?

28:27.296 --> 28:30.001
We seeded the ocean floor with targets.

28:30.675 --> 28:33.759
- Dummy bombs.
- He was going out to locate them.

28:35.263 --> 28:37.551
He had reservations
about the project, didn't he?

28:37.640 --> 28:39.051
Not that I know of.

28:41.394 --> 28:43.635
Is something wrong, Agent Gibbs?

28:43.729 --> 28:45.105
I don't know.

28:45.189 --> 28:49.317
Just sometimes you think you have a
bead on someone that turns out bogus.

28:49.735 --> 28:51.313
It's upsetting.

28:52.238 --> 28:53.483
The point is?

28:53.572 --> 28:56.858
I didn't take you
for a party line type, Commander.

28:59.245 --> 29:03.077
Commander Egan wasn't sure
the range was as good as promised.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.415
What if Commander Egan's test
turned up negative?

29:08.087 --> 29:10.874
The Navy wouldn't pick up
Side-Scan's contract.

29:10.965 --> 29:12.245
And Overmeyer?

29:12.341 --> 29:14.085
He'd lose a fortune.

29:14.552 --> 29:16.176
I'm gonna press my luck here.

29:16.262 --> 29:17.341
Okay.

29:17.638 --> 29:19.927
What if the prototype isn't found?

29:20.016 --> 29:22.933
Side-Scan will probably
be granted an extension,

29:23.019 --> 29:25.474
which would buy time
to correct any problems.

29:25.563 --> 29:28.018
But there aren't any serious flaws,
Agent Gibbs.

29:28.107 --> 29:31.108
Would you submit
to a voluntary DNA swab?

29:33.612 --> 29:37.527
I'd like to eliminate you
as Lieutenant Commander Egan's lover.

29:40.286 --> 29:42.492
There wouldn't be much point.

29:42.788 --> 29:45.742
Tom and I had been seeing each other
for months.

29:47.877 --> 29:50.202
Anything else you want to press?

29:50.713 --> 29:51.744
No.

29:54.383 --> 29:56.043
I gotta get back.

30:12.109 --> 30:13.188
Gina?

30:14.362 --> 30:15.441
Yeah?

30:15.696 --> 30:17.772
Anthony DiNozzo, NCIS.

30:18.699 --> 30:22.199
- What do you want?
- I just want to ask you a few questions.

30:23.120 --> 30:24.401
I'm busy.

30:25.664 --> 30:28.452
Were you sunbathing yesterday
on the Base beach?

30:28.542 --> 30:30.452
Wait, wait. You were watching me?

30:30.544 --> 30:31.624
No.

30:31.712 --> 30:33.504
Then how'd you know I was there?

30:33.589 --> 30:37.207
I'm not at liberty to discuss
the actual surveillance activity.

30:38.594 --> 30:40.468
Please leave me alone.

30:40.679 --> 30:42.339
Let me get my I.D.

30:47.686 --> 30:50.391
I can appreciate how it must've looked.

30:52.983 --> 30:54.775
Okay, Tony.

30:54.860 --> 30:58.110
I still can't believe Lauren Tyler
admitted to having an affair with Egan.

30:58.197 --> 30:59.822
Well, she's smart.

31:00.116 --> 31:03.531
When I asked her for a DNA sample,
she knew I had her.

31:03.619 --> 31:07.154
Always better to volunteer information
than cover it up.

31:08.916 --> 31:10.707
What are your people doing?

31:10.793 --> 31:11.956
Seizing your files.

31:12.044 --> 31:15.247
It's part of our investigation
into Commander Egan's death.

31:15.339 --> 31:17.830
You think he was killed
for the prototype?

31:17.925 --> 31:20.760
I think he had concerns
about performance.

31:21.137 --> 31:22.880
Well, you're wrong.

31:23.806 --> 31:26.760
I try so hard not to be wrong,
don't I, Kate?

31:27.017 --> 31:29.010
You're very conscientious
in that regard, Gibbs.

31:29.103 --> 31:30.831
All right, we might have had
a glitch or two,

31:30.855 --> 31:33.375
but nothing that wouldn't
have been corrected before production.

31:33.441 --> 31:35.896
See, you I did figure
for the party line type.

31:35.985 --> 31:37.147
What's that supposed to mean?

31:37.236 --> 31:39.857
Why was there
only one prototype made?

31:40.114 --> 31:44.194
I funded all the R&D personally.
I don't have pockets that deep.

31:44.285 --> 31:46.443
This loss is just devastating.

31:46.537 --> 31:48.494
But it also buys you time.

31:48.581 --> 31:51.747
Are you insinuating I had something
to do with Tom Egan's death?

31:52.126 --> 31:55.376
I try so hard not to insinuate,
don't I, Kate?

31:55.504 --> 31:57.331
You rarely insinuate, Gibbs.

31:57.423 --> 31:58.502
Yeah.

31:58.716 --> 32:01.337
All I'm doing now is taking your records.

32:01.427 --> 32:03.633
I'm calling my legal counsel.

32:04.013 --> 32:06.848
I would bet that he will insinuate plenty.

32:09.977 --> 32:11.056
Here.

32:11.395 --> 32:12.770
Sign this.

32:13.355 --> 32:14.435
What's that for?

32:14.523 --> 32:16.432
It's a receipt for your files.

32:17.526 --> 32:19.186
All of your files.

32:28.662 --> 32:30.738
We know the killer is left-handed.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.198
Jonathan Overmeyer is left-handed.

32:33.292 --> 32:34.917
What about Commander Tyler?

32:35.044 --> 32:38.495
She wears her watch on her left hand
like most right-handed people do.

32:38.672 --> 32:40.332
The service file will verify.

32:40.424 --> 32:42.251
They could be in it together.

32:42.968 --> 32:44.344
They could.

32:46.847 --> 32:48.010
- Gibbs.
- I found her, boss.

32:48.098 --> 32:49.557
We're in the base gym.

32:51.560 --> 32:53.802
DiNozzo found our polar bear.

32:54.063 --> 32:55.687
You were on the beach yesterday?

32:55.773 --> 32:58.442
Yes, sir. I know it's against regs
to sunbathe naked,

32:58.526 --> 33:00.518
but I never thought
I'd be caught in winter.

33:00.611 --> 33:02.319
I don't know what came over me.

33:02.404 --> 33:04.362
I just really hate tan lines.

33:04.448 --> 33:05.729
Don't you?

33:06.200 --> 33:09.035
Sometimes I lay awake at night
thinking about that.

33:09.119 --> 33:10.863
Did you see anybody else there?

33:10.955 --> 33:12.153
Well, that's why I left.

33:12.248 --> 33:14.739
I heard a vehicle,
saw this guy getting out in a wetsuit.

33:14.833 --> 33:17.040
- I covered up and left.
- Was he alone?

33:17.127 --> 33:18.752
Now, I thought so at first.

33:18.837 --> 33:21.957
But as I was walking back to my car,
I heard voices and glanced back.

33:22.049 --> 33:25.003
- He was arguing with someone else.
- Can you describe him?

33:25.094 --> 33:26.125
Her.

33:27.555 --> 33:29.843
All I can tell you is
that she was military.

33:37.473 --> 33:40.758
We know the killer was left-handed,
which eliminates Commander Tyler,

33:40.851 --> 33:42.725
whose service file confirms
she's a righty.

33:42.811 --> 33:44.305
We also know the killer is a woman.

33:44.396 --> 33:46.436
Unless Overmeyer
went "Norman Bates" on the guy.

33:46.523 --> 33:48.516
Actually, when you think about it,
the MOs match.

33:48.609 --> 33:49.854
DiNozzo.

33:51.487 --> 33:52.566
What did you do?

33:52.654 --> 33:55.192
So basically we eliminated
our two best suspects.

33:55.282 --> 33:57.654
Neither is a left-handed woman
in the military.

33:57.743 --> 33:59.320
Appears so, yeah.

33:59.411 --> 34:01.285
Damn! And they were good suspects.

34:01.371 --> 34:03.163
- Yeah, maybe too good.
- What do you mean?

34:03.248 --> 34:05.704
We got carried away
with the missing prototype.

34:05.793 --> 34:08.877
Espionage and whistle-blowing
is a lot more intriguing than someone...

34:08.962 --> 34:10.706
Who's just really pissed off.

34:11.047 --> 34:12.328
Egan's wife?

34:12.424 --> 34:14.962
Her husband was diving
on someone else's reef.

34:15.052 --> 34:16.879
Dipping the fin in the company pool.

34:16.969 --> 34:18.215
Pinging the wrong pong.

34:18.304 --> 34:22.137
Egan's wife didn't get back
from the seminar until after the murder.

34:22.226 --> 34:23.554
That's what she said.

34:23.643 --> 34:25.351
She's a military officer.

34:25.646 --> 34:27.887
Yeah, she is. And she plays golf.

34:28.565 --> 34:29.846
Left-handed.

34:30.025 --> 34:31.223
Wait, wait, wait.

34:31.318 --> 34:35.185
You could see that the clubs were
left-handed with just a passing glance?

34:35.280 --> 34:37.402
My second wife played golf left-handed.

34:37.491 --> 34:38.522
So?

34:38.617 --> 34:41.237
When someone tries
to split your skull open with a 7-iron,

34:41.328 --> 34:42.656
it's not a club you soon forget.

34:42.746 --> 34:45.118
There was an edge
in the Lieutenant's voice when she said

34:45.206 --> 34:47.246
things had changed
in the last few months.

34:47.333 --> 34:48.815
If she knew he was cheating on her...

34:48.877 --> 34:50.585
Wait, just because
she golfs left-handed

34:50.670 --> 34:52.829
doesn't mean
she actually is left-handed.

34:52.922 --> 34:56.172
I golf left-handed
but I bat and I throw right-handed.

34:56.510 --> 34:58.419
So you go both ways?

34:59.429 --> 35:02.383
All I'm saying is that
we don't actually have anything on her.

35:02.474 --> 35:05.309
We don't even know if she knew that
her husband was having an affair.

35:05.394 --> 35:06.592
True.

35:07.271 --> 35:08.895
So it's just a hunch.

35:08.981 --> 35:10.095
Yeah.

35:10.941 --> 35:12.269
There's no proof.

35:12.359 --> 35:13.438
No.

35:19.283 --> 35:20.481
Hello.

35:20.784 --> 35:22.362
Lieutenant Egan.

35:22.494 --> 35:24.819
- Please, come on in.
- Thank you.

35:27.833 --> 35:29.991
We have a dilemma to share with you.

35:30.085 --> 35:32.208
Dilemma. What's the problem?

35:32.504 --> 35:34.627
We think that your husband was killed

35:34.715 --> 35:37.799
because he was about to expose flaws
in the Side-Scan prototype

35:37.885 --> 35:38.999
he was developing.

35:39.094 --> 35:41.383
- I see.
- But we can't prove it.

35:41.972 --> 35:44.214
There was only one prototype made

35:44.308 --> 35:46.633
and that was taken
from the crime scene.

35:46.727 --> 35:49.728
We've conducted a search,
but so far no luck.

35:49.813 --> 35:52.893
We'll have to find it to have a chance
of building a case against the suspect.

35:53.400 --> 35:54.775
You have a suspect?

35:55.861 --> 35:59.444
A witness saw a woman
arguing with your husband on the beach

35:59.531 --> 36:01.607
just before he was stabbed.

36:02.075 --> 36:05.444
We think it was
the Commanding Officer, Lauren Tyler.

36:06.663 --> 36:09.071
There's no easy way to ask this,

36:09.625 --> 36:13.290
but did you know your husband
was having an affair with her?

36:16.715 --> 36:18.708
He was having an affair?

36:24.389 --> 36:26.049
It looks that way.

36:26.475 --> 36:28.218
Can you confirm our suspicion

36:28.310 --> 36:30.717
that your husband was having doubts
about this project?

36:31.813 --> 36:34.483
I'm afraid not. He never mentioned it.

36:38.654 --> 36:39.768
Okay.

36:40.155 --> 36:41.649
Thank you for your time.

36:41.740 --> 36:43.300
Sorry to have to drag you through this.

36:45.494 --> 36:48.199
What do you think happened to him?
Why was he killed?

36:53.335 --> 36:55.956
We think that he told Commander Tyler.

36:56.046 --> 36:59.249
And that when they both confronted
Jonathan Overmeyer,

36:59.341 --> 37:01.583
he offered them money
to keep them silent.

37:01.677 --> 37:03.550
- And Tom refused.
- Yes.

37:03.637 --> 37:05.629
He would never take money.

37:05.722 --> 37:07.514
But Tyler went along.

37:07.641 --> 37:11.555
We believe they killed him,
then had to hide the prototype fast.

37:11.979 --> 37:15.846
We need to find it. If we don't,
we don't have much of a case.

37:16.066 --> 37:19.020
It's the only conclusive proof
we have of defects.

37:26.284 --> 37:28.324
You think she took the bait?

37:28.412 --> 37:30.737
Pretty hard to pass up
getting away with murder

37:30.831 --> 37:32.907
and framing your husband's lover.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.158
Well, if she's guilty,
she's a pretty good actress.

37:35.252 --> 37:38.585
- You weren't bad yourself, kid.
- Made me feel creepy.

37:38.714 --> 37:39.793
Why?

37:40.757 --> 37:43.509
You still don't believe
she knew about her husband's affair?

37:43.593 --> 37:45.467
The wife's always
the last one to know, Gibbs.

37:46.763 --> 37:48.174
Don't believe it.

37:49.808 --> 37:51.006
I hope you're right.

37:51.268 --> 37:54.471
Otherwise we were pretty cold
to a woman who just lost her husband.

37:54.563 --> 37:56.354
Well, let's find out.

37:58.025 --> 37:59.104
Hello?

37:59.192 --> 38:00.224
Abs?

38:01.111 --> 38:02.356
- Call your boy.
- All right.

38:14.082 --> 38:16.039
So how long do you get to use the bird?

38:16.126 --> 38:18.368
Don't worry, Abs.
I'm borrowing it from G-Nex Corp,

38:18.462 --> 38:19.707
and they owe me big time.

38:19.796 --> 38:21.290
It's asynchronous, multi-positional

38:21.381 --> 38:23.582
and has thermal infrared.
It's perfect for your purpose.

38:23.633 --> 38:25.211
And they just let you have it?

38:25.302 --> 38:27.129
Technically, it's down for maintenance.

38:32.809 --> 38:35.929
Are you going to the lecture next week
on apogee deterioration

38:36.021 --> 38:37.349
of the Amstat 511?

38:37.939 --> 38:39.184
Been there, done that.

38:40.484 --> 38:42.144
We have movement.

38:46.698 --> 38:50.399
Gibbs, she's on the move.
I'll redirect the satellite to you.

39:01.046 --> 39:02.623
Are you getting this?

39:02.964 --> 39:04.672
- Yeah.
- Let's roll.

39:04.841 --> 39:06.039
Hang on.

39:06.134 --> 39:07.961
Let's get some separation.

39:10.639 --> 39:14.886
She's leaving the base.
She's turning onto highway 264

39:14.976 --> 39:16.056
going south.

39:16.186 --> 39:17.597
Okay, Lieutenant.

39:18.188 --> 39:20.181
Let's see where you're going.

39:29.241 --> 39:31.447
I hope she's not
just popping out for a Big Mac.

39:31.535 --> 39:33.823
- Where are you guys?
- Just hanging back.

39:33.912 --> 39:35.157
A mile behind her.

39:36.748 --> 39:40.247
You know, we really should have
our own satellite for surveillance.

39:40.335 --> 39:43.751
Yeah, okay, Tony.
I'll take that up with the director.

39:43.880 --> 39:47.415
Three hours of satellite time
equals your yearly salary.

39:49.970 --> 39:51.001
She's turning.

39:53.223 --> 39:54.551
We see it.

39:55.267 --> 39:58.433
- Abby?
- I think Houston has a problem.

39:58.854 --> 40:00.478
Ash, what's going on?

40:00.564 --> 40:02.272
Lost the signal. Give me a second.

40:04.568 --> 40:06.560
The low-gain antenna
has been intermittent.

40:06.653 --> 40:08.729
That's why it's offline for maintenance.

40:08.989 --> 40:10.483
We're losing her.

40:13.869 --> 40:15.114
You're the man, Ash.

40:15.203 --> 40:17.955
Ash is the man
if he gets our target back.

40:25.297 --> 40:26.625
I'm looking for it.

40:28.091 --> 40:30.926
- Take that right there.
- We gotta take it. She did.

40:33.013 --> 40:34.555
Then what, Abby?

40:34.931 --> 40:36.509
All right, I think that's it.

40:36.600 --> 40:37.679
You think?

40:39.227 --> 40:40.556
It better be.

41:17.474 --> 41:19.217
Do you need a hand?

41:35.784 --> 41:37.195
You're late.

41:37.285 --> 41:39.657
Sorry, I was at the dry cleaners.

41:40.205 --> 41:41.236
So?

41:41.706 --> 41:43.082
For Ducky.

41:44.501 --> 41:45.580
So?

41:46.503 --> 41:47.831
It was work-related.

41:47.921 --> 41:51.005
Your phone has been ringing
off the hook. It's driving him crazy.

41:51.091 --> 41:53.332
Well, she is driving me crazy.

41:53.635 --> 41:54.714
She?

41:54.844 --> 41:59.091
Apparently Miss "I Don't Like Tan Lines"
has found something she does like.

41:59.891 --> 42:01.006
Me.

42:02.018 --> 42:03.678
And why is that a problem?

42:03.770 --> 42:07.720
Well, let's just say that she's a lot more
appealing from a distance.

42:07.816 --> 42:10.104
A geosynchronist distance.

42:11.486 --> 42:13.028
She didn't look so bad to me.

42:13.446 --> 42:14.989
It's not that.

42:15.490 --> 42:17.032
She's just not my type.

42:19.077 --> 42:23.655
Really? Female hard body who likes
to take her clothes off is not your type?

42:24.416 --> 42:25.661
I guess not.

42:25.750 --> 42:28.122
Why don't you just tell her that, then?

42:28.211 --> 42:30.832
- I am.
- By not answering her calls?

42:31.172 --> 42:32.715
She'll get the message.

42:35.302 --> 42:36.464
Apparently not.

42:39.306 --> 42:41.678
Well, she'd better get
the message soon,

42:41.766 --> 42:44.518
or you're going to be
getting one on a pink slip.

42:44.602 --> 42:47.556
You can't fire me
for something I have no control over!

42:48.189 --> 42:49.648
Talk to her.

42:49.733 --> 42:51.559
She'll get the message!

42:53.945 --> 42:57.610
You know, I bet this is why number two
came after you with a nine iron,

42:57.699 --> 42:58.730
wasn't it?

42:58.825 --> 43:02.028
You just refused
to sit down and talk things through.

43:02.579 --> 43:04.370
Actually, that wasn't it at all.

43:04.456 --> 43:06.199
No? So what was it then?

43:08.043 --> 43:09.418
Seven iron.
