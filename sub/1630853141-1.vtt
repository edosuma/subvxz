00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:27.583 --> 00:30.250
Just walk like the camera's not there.

00:30.333 --> 00:32.833
-I'm cold, I'm going to the car.
-This again.

00:32.916 --> 00:35.333
Fine, whatever, Carla.
You're out of my movie.

00:36.750 --> 00:38.958
Sandra, how do you fix the focus?

00:39.041 --> 00:41.583
You have to put it on automatic.

00:42.583 --> 00:44.875
Careful, it might start any second now.

00:44.958 --> 00:47.458
-Wait, does this look good? Look.
-No, it's--

00:47.541 --> 00:48.750
To the left.

00:48.833 --> 00:50.333
Don't you need more light?

00:50.833 --> 00:51.666
Let's see.

00:51.750 --> 00:53.000
Yeah, a little--

02:05.000 --> 02:07.250
Mild to moderate

02:07.750 --> 02:09.500
winds

02:09.583 --> 02:12.375
in the west region.

02:16.541 --> 02:19.250
MONDAY, APRIL 12
CARLA, VOICE MESSAGE

02:21.250 --> 02:24.875
Mild to moderate winds

02:24.958 --> 02:27.166
in the west region.

02:35.208 --> 02:36.833
<i>Dad, this is my second message.</i>

02:36.916 --> 02:40.291
<i>I left the first one 40 minutes ago.</i>

02:40.375 --> 02:41.416
<i>It's still unread,</i>

02:41.500 --> 02:44.333
<i>and I see you were online 15 minutes ago.</i>

02:44.416 --> 02:46.833
<i>It's fine, but this is important.</i>

02:46.916 --> 02:50.583
<i>I'll summarize</i>
<i>so you don't lose precious time.</i>

02:50.666 --> 02:52.083
<i>I need you to come here.</i>

02:52.166 --> 02:55.750
<i>Come to Córdoba,</i>
<i>even if it's just for a day.</i>

02:55.833 --> 02:58.666
<i>We have to figure out</i>
<i>what to do about the house.</i>

02:58.750 --> 03:00.000
<i>Please, call me.</i>

03:13.583 --> 03:14.625
Maxi.

03:15.333 --> 03:17.541
<i>I think they're planning a surprise.</i>

03:17.625 --> 03:18.541
What surprise?

03:18.625 --> 03:19.458
<i>I don't know.</i>

03:19.541 --> 03:20.541
What do you mean?

03:21.250 --> 03:25.000
<i>I overheard Gustavo and Muldín,</i>
<i>but they saw me and changed the subject.</i>

03:25.083 --> 03:26.750
Well, investigate, Maxi.

03:26.833 --> 03:29.041
No surprises,
especially before the premiere.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.666
<i>Don't worry,</i>
<i>your cab will be there in five.</i>

03:31.750 --> 03:32.791
Okay.

03:32.875 --> 03:34.250
Morning, Osvaldito.

03:34.333 --> 03:36.125
It's a beautiful day, lazy.

03:36.208 --> 03:37.166
Wake up.

04:12.333 --> 04:13.208
Osvaldo.

04:13.708 --> 04:14.708
Osvaldito.

04:15.458 --> 04:16.750
Where's the baby?

04:16.833 --> 04:17.791
Where?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.958
Come on, it's a big day for Daddy.

04:21.041 --> 04:23.333
Daddy's going to work. Where are you?

04:24.416 --> 04:25.250
Osvaldito?

04:26.750 --> 04:29.166
Osvaldo, don't scare me. Where are you?

04:29.791 --> 04:30.625
Osvaldito?

04:33.250 --> 04:35.125
Oh, son of a bitch.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.916
You scared me.

04:37.625 --> 04:39.583
Where did you go? To pee?

04:40.166 --> 04:42.375
You're acting weird, Osvaldo.

04:42.458 --> 04:44.958
Don't freak me out
when I'm on my way to work.

04:45.458 --> 04:46.333
What's wrong?

04:47.666 --> 04:50.125
Give your dad a kiss. I'm going to work.

04:50.208 --> 04:51.458
Give your dad a kiss.

04:53.375 --> 04:56.416
There. Was that so hard?

05:23.708 --> 05:24.625
Miguel Flores!

05:25.125 --> 05:26.583
-Hello.
-My idol.

05:27.083 --> 05:28.208
I can't believe it.

05:28.291 --> 05:30.333
Hey, let me take a selfie.

05:30.416 --> 05:31.375
Okay, of course.

05:31.458 --> 05:33.166
-Yeah?
-Of course.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.250
-This way.
-There.

05:34.333 --> 05:36.333
-Take your glasses off.
-Okay.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.916
Miguel, boss.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.541
See you.

05:42.125 --> 05:43.333
-There.
-Thanks, man.

05:43.416 --> 05:45.291
I'll be watching tonight with the family.

05:45.375 --> 05:47.041
-Thank you.
-You legend.

05:47.750 --> 05:50.166
Miguelito, hi.

05:50.250 --> 05:53.666
I have 20 kilograms of clothes
to hang tonight on the terrace,

05:53.750 --> 05:54.958
tell me it won't rain.

05:55.041 --> 05:56.250
Don't worry, Elvirita.

05:56.333 --> 05:57.666
Tonight will be clear,

05:57.750 --> 05:59.958
between about 20 and 22 degrees.

06:00.041 --> 06:03.875
Well, I'll be watching at 9:45.

06:03.958 --> 06:06.333
The promos have been non-stop.

06:06.416 --> 06:07.958
I'm excited, Elvirita.

06:08.041 --> 06:11.833
It's Argentina's first weather show.
It's big.

06:11.916 --> 06:14.333
Yeah, and you look good, sweetie.

06:14.416 --> 06:18.458
-I don't know. The competition is tough.
-You'll get good ratings. Come on.

06:18.541 --> 06:20.458
-Okay, Elvirita.
-Okay, Miguelito.

06:20.541 --> 06:21.708
-Let's go.
-That's right.

06:23.500 --> 06:26.708
Hi, Maxi. I'm at the door
and the cab's not here.

06:26.791 --> 06:28.291
Any word on the surprise?

06:29.500 --> 06:31.125
Sorry for bothering you.

06:31.208 --> 06:32.833
No, Alfonso. Hi Kiko.

06:32.916 --> 06:34.333
I love you, Miguel.

06:34.416 --> 06:36.000
-Have a good day.
-Bye.

06:36.083 --> 06:37.416
I have a question.

06:37.500 --> 06:41.041
My wife decided to use a bug bomb
in the living room and kitchen.

06:41.125 --> 06:43.875
She wants Kiko to sleep
on the patio tonight.

06:43.958 --> 06:45.833
I'm a little scared.

06:46.416 --> 06:49.041
But Gamexane is a very strong poison.

06:49.125 --> 06:53.041
-It is.
-If he gets sick… we couldn't take it.

06:53.125 --> 06:54.875
Kiko is the son we never had.

06:54.958 --> 06:57.125
Don't worry, Alfonso.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.750
It'll be a clear night.

06:58.833 --> 07:02.208
Between 20 and 22 degrees, max.

07:02.291 --> 07:04.500
I'm glad. Thank you so much.

07:04.583 --> 07:07.166
So, Kiko, you're sleeping outside.

07:07.250 --> 07:09.250
Sorry for bothering you.

07:09.333 --> 07:11.083
-No, please.
-Have a good day.

07:11.166 --> 07:12.583
Of course, you too.

07:12.666 --> 07:15.125
See you. Tell your wife I say hi.

07:15.208 --> 07:16.166
Bye.

07:17.208 --> 07:18.833
Look who it is.

07:19.958 --> 07:22.083
The guy from the weather show?

07:22.166 --> 07:23.666
-Yes.
-You know who he is, right?

07:23.750 --> 07:24.875
No.

07:24.958 --> 07:27.208
No, kids today know nothing.

07:27.291 --> 07:31.291
They spend all day on their phones
taking photos with their tongues out.

07:32.666 --> 07:34.291
-They're always horny.
-Grandma!

07:34.375 --> 07:36.208
-What?
-I'm sorry, she's shameless.

07:36.291 --> 07:37.458
No, it's okay.

07:37.541 --> 07:38.916
Good luck tonight.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.458
-Thank you.
-Give me a shout out.

07:41.541 --> 07:42.916
-Okay.
-I'm Mabel.

07:43.000 --> 07:43.916
Mabel.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.625
-Mabel.
-Mabel!

07:45.708 --> 07:47.666
-Bye.
-Miguel?

07:49.500 --> 07:50.875
Yes. Maxi.

07:50.958 --> 07:54.500
-<i>The car's been there for ten minutes.</i>
<i>-</i> They lied, it just came.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.666
9:45 tonight, right?

07:56.750 --> 07:58.791
-Yes.
-Good luck.

07:58.875 --> 08:01.000
Thank you. Bye.

08:06.791 --> 08:10.000
MAKE YOUR CITY AN OASIS THIS SUMMER
THE INFALLIBLE

08:16.291 --> 08:20.208
The Great Weather Show <i>starts this Monday</i>
<i>on Channel Ten, prime time.</i>

08:20.291 --> 08:24.125
<i>And here we have the host,</i>
<i>Mr. Miguel Flores, The Infallible.</i>

08:24.750 --> 08:27.625
<i>Well, God is the only one</i>
<i>who's truly infallible.</i>

08:27.708 --> 08:30.458
<i>Although it's true that in 20 years,</i>

08:30.541 --> 08:32.416
<i>I've never been wrong.</i>

08:32.500 --> 08:35.208
<i>So you're like the god of weather?</i>

08:35.291 --> 08:36.375
<i>You said it.</i>

08:43.708 --> 08:45.458
MIGUEL FLORES
THE GREAT WEATHER SHOW

08:47.083 --> 08:48.291
Is that you in the picture?

08:48.916 --> 08:52.583
-What picture?
-There, for <i>The Great Weather Show.</i>

08:52.666 --> 08:53.833
Yes, that's me.

08:53.916 --> 08:56.333
-You're famous.
-A bit.

08:56.875 --> 08:58.500
How long ago was that photo taken?

08:58.583 --> 09:00.875
What do you mean? It's from last month.

09:00.958 --> 09:01.791
Why?

09:01.875 --> 09:03.541
No, just--

09:05.250 --> 09:07.416
What's the show about?

09:09.333 --> 09:10.250
The weather.

09:10.333 --> 09:12.583
You've never seen the news on Channel Ten?

09:12.666 --> 09:15.541
It used to be a segment that was
part of the news.

09:16.166 --> 09:19.291
No, I stream shows on my computer.
I don't watch TV, honestly.

09:19.375 --> 09:22.083
My parents watch TV sometimes at night,
my grandma.

09:22.166 --> 09:23.916
-My grandma does.
-Really?

09:24.000 --> 09:25.375
-Yes.
-Okay.

09:25.458 --> 09:27.958
-Can you turn the music down a bit?
-Yes.

09:28.041 --> 09:28.875
It's loud.

09:28.958 --> 09:31.250
-Sorry. Is that okay?
-Yes.

09:32.250 --> 09:34.625
So what do you do on the show?

09:35.875 --> 09:37.250
I predict the weather.

09:37.333 --> 09:38.166
And,

09:38.750 --> 09:40.208
I mean,

09:40.291 --> 09:42.833
does that pay well?

09:43.916 --> 09:45.583
Almost as well as driving a taxi.

09:46.208 --> 09:47.791
-Okay, we'll trade.
-Yeah.

09:47.875 --> 09:48.750
Okay.

09:49.625 --> 09:53.541
Do you have to take a class for that?
I might be interested in--

09:53.625 --> 09:55.250
A class? No, it's a degree.

09:55.916 --> 09:58.958
Yeah, atmospheric sciences.
It takes seven years.

09:59.041 --> 10:00.208
Oh, no way.

10:00.291 --> 10:01.666
I have an app for that.

10:01.750 --> 10:04.833
-It gives me a ten day forecast.
-How accurate is it?

10:04.916 --> 10:06.333
-It's accurate.
-Okay.

10:06.416 --> 10:07.833
No way.

10:07.916 --> 10:11.041
Those apps take data
from meteorology reports,

10:11.125 --> 10:12.750
they put it on a colored graph,

10:12.833 --> 10:14.750
and with a mathematical equation,

10:14.833 --> 10:17.041
they calculate regional probabilities--

10:17.125 --> 10:19.375
Use your signal, asshole!

10:19.458 --> 10:20.750
Ridiculous.

10:20.833 --> 10:23.000
This country, God.

10:23.666 --> 10:26.541
-There's a game on Saturday.
-It's going to rain.

10:26.625 --> 10:29.083
-How do you know?
-Did you watch Miguel Flores?

10:29.583 --> 10:32.875
If you want to know,
you have to watch Miguel Flores.

10:32.958 --> 10:34.958
Weather people are frauds.

10:35.041 --> 10:37.458
They get their info from their phones.

10:37.541 --> 10:39.333
Yeah, but not Miguel.

10:39.416 --> 10:41.708
Miguel studied meteorology.
He's never been wrong.

10:41.791 --> 10:45.208
-Did he pay you to say that?
-No, but he's never wrong.

10:45.291 --> 10:47.625
He's a unique talent, he's never wrong.

10:47.708 --> 10:49.541
-All you do is talk about him, dude.
-So?

10:50.458 --> 10:53.875
This is what I think,
you have a thing for The Infallible One.

10:56.708 --> 10:58.375
What are you laughing at?

10:58.458 --> 11:01.041
This again? I'm fed up with you two.

11:01.125 --> 11:03.000
-Don't get mad.
-I'm fed up!

11:03.083 --> 11:04.958
-Stop fucking around!
-Wait.

11:05.041 --> 11:07.708
Jorge, give him a pastry
so his blood sugar spikes.

11:07.791 --> 11:11.208
A dozen so they'll leave me alone.
Screw off.

11:12.458 --> 11:13.750
Okay, thank you.

11:14.375 --> 11:15.208
Bye.

11:18.125 --> 11:20.625
Miguelito, tonight's the night.

11:20.708 --> 11:22.291
A critical change, Domingo.

11:22.375 --> 11:23.583
Good luck.

11:26.666 --> 11:29.041
-Let's go, Miguelito.
-Let's go.

11:29.125 --> 11:31.083
Extras to Studio Four, please.

11:32.791 --> 11:34.791
-Carmencita.
-Miguelito. Nervous?

11:34.875 --> 11:36.666
-No, excited.
-Let's go.

11:52.625 --> 11:54.833
Miguel, finally.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.083
Hi. Is this the suit?

11:58.166 --> 12:01.666
No. Tell me you don't like it
and I'll run into traffic.

12:01.750 --> 12:03.166
You tried it on Thursday.

12:03.250 --> 12:05.791
Who said I didn't like it?
I'm just asking.

12:05.875 --> 12:08.000
-No, but it's nice.
-Oh, okay.

12:08.083 --> 12:11.041
Now, the neon cloud on the door,
did you do that?

12:11.583 --> 12:14.416
-If you say you don't like it, I'll die.
-Stop.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.375
You can't kill yourself
over everything, Maxi. God.

12:17.458 --> 12:19.458
"Keep up the good work." That's nice.

12:19.541 --> 12:20.958
Did you see all this?

12:21.041 --> 12:22.416
-Beautiful.
-Beautiful.

12:22.500 --> 12:25.000
Did you get the report
from the Weather Service?

12:25.083 --> 12:27.041
-You didn't get it?
-No.

12:27.125 --> 12:29.500
I sent it to you. Check your phone.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.958
-Miguelito.
-Hey!

12:32.041 --> 12:34.625
-The day has come.
-Let's do this!

12:34.708 --> 12:36.541
-How are you?
-Good. Energetic.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.291
Great, I can tell.

12:38.375 --> 12:41.125
Your aura is glowing,
your eyes are shining.

12:41.208 --> 12:42.041
You look great.

12:42.125 --> 12:43.541
-Beautiful.
-Great.

12:44.166 --> 12:46.125
So, what do you think of Mery Oliva?

12:46.208 --> 12:48.083
-Who?
-What do you mean, "Who"?

12:48.166 --> 12:50.500
Mery Oliva, the reporter from Channel 23.

12:50.583 --> 12:52.875
-I don't know her.
-Your secretary.

12:54.166 --> 12:56.375
She's your new on-air secretary.

12:57.458 --> 12:58.541
That's the surprise.

12:59.041 --> 13:01.541
Gustavo, I don't need a secretary.

13:01.625 --> 13:03.583
We all need a secretary. Come with me.

13:03.666 --> 13:05.916
-No, wait. Let me get ready.
-Yeah.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.500
-Come with me.
-I need to focus.

13:07.583 --> 13:09.041
Don't be shy, you'll love her.

13:09.125 --> 13:12.416
Trust me. She brings in the younger crowd.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.208
Why so last minute?

13:14.291 --> 13:17.166
She'll be to the side the whole show.
She'll read funny tweets.

13:17.250 --> 13:18.083
-Gustavo.
-Hi.

13:18.166 --> 13:20.500
You can't hassle me with this now.

13:20.583 --> 13:23.000
-My God, you're difficult.
-I'm difficult?

13:23.083 --> 13:25.625
Yes. This could be good for ratings.

13:25.708 --> 13:27.166
Nothing satisfies you.

13:27.250 --> 13:29.666
How many Instagram followers do you have?

13:29.750 --> 13:30.833
How many do you have?

13:31.541 --> 13:33.000
-312,000.
-Two million.

13:33.083 --> 13:35.583
-So?
-She has two million. That's a lot.

13:35.666 --> 13:37.833
It doesn't matter if she has nine million!

13:37.916 --> 13:39.291
It matters a lot.

13:39.375 --> 13:40.875
-Today's the day, Miguel.
-Hi.

13:40.958 --> 13:42.000
Hey, how are you?

13:42.083 --> 13:44.375
Okay, but you have to give me a heads up.

13:44.458 --> 13:46.000
I'm the face of the show.

13:46.083 --> 13:48.541
-Yes, I know.
-So?

13:48.625 --> 13:50.666
You have to trust me. I can't do it alone.

13:50.750 --> 13:54.833
-You have to trust.
-No, don't tell me I'm not trusting.

13:54.916 --> 13:57.750
We've been in pre-production
for two months.

13:57.833 --> 14:01.000
When you wanted the salsa band,
what did I say?

14:01.083 --> 14:04.625
-"I want a big band, like Glenn Miller."
-Glenn Miller, look.

14:04.708 --> 14:07.250
Don't make me dance.

14:07.333 --> 14:09.125
Look at them. God.

14:09.208 --> 14:11.333
-Hello.
-You wanted the world, there it is.

14:11.416 --> 14:14.958
-Guys, you're great.
-Amazing.

14:15.041 --> 14:17.125
I told you she was a bombshell.

14:17.208 --> 14:19.041
What we did on Channel 23, remember?

14:19.125 --> 14:21.500
But with more production value.

14:21.583 --> 14:23.791
Gus wants the show to be an event.

14:23.875 --> 14:25.500
Gus.

14:25.583 --> 14:27.625
-Okay, you didn't mention that.
-Okay.

14:27.708 --> 14:30.541
Mery, beautiful,
let me introduce you to Miguel.

14:30.625 --> 14:32.000
Hi.

14:34.125 --> 14:35.916
-My mom loves you.
-Wow.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.291
-We're done, right?
-Yes.

14:37.375 --> 14:39.291
Her notes need to mention the weather.

14:39.375 --> 14:41.041
Yeah, Mery was telling me--

14:41.125 --> 14:45.375
I don't know what Channel 23 was like,
but what you'll see here

14:45.458 --> 14:48.166
hasn't ever been seen
on any other weather channel in Argentina,

14:48.250 --> 14:49.458
so write it down.

14:49.541 --> 14:51.083
-Okay, I will.
-Yes.

14:51.166 --> 14:53.083
-He didn't write it down.
-He will.

14:53.166 --> 14:54.500
You told him twice.

14:54.583 --> 14:57.583
-Mery's on Twitter and Instagram duty.
-And Facebook.

14:57.666 --> 14:59.250
Facebook doesn't matter much.

14:59.333 --> 15:00.916
For Miguel's fans it does.

15:01.541 --> 15:03.458
Right. And is the dog working with us?

15:03.541 --> 15:05.833
No, I can't.

15:06.833 --> 15:08.625
-So cute.
-Excuse me, Miguel.

15:08.708 --> 15:11.125
-Stand in front of the screen.
-Okay.

15:11.208 --> 15:12.375
Okay. Here?

15:12.458 --> 15:14.833
-Look at this.
-Perfect. There it is.

15:14.916 --> 15:15.875
Look at this.

15:15.958 --> 15:18.625
-Just like I dreamed. Look.
-Beautiful.

15:18.708 --> 15:20.291
-Look what we did.
-Yeah.

15:20.375 --> 15:22.666
-We set this up for you.
-Yeah, you did.

15:22.750 --> 15:26.083
This is going to be a success.
The people upstairs are excited.

15:26.166 --> 15:27.916
I'm excited. And the sponsors are--

15:28.000 --> 15:29.541
Excited, I'm sure. I am too.

15:29.625 --> 15:31.375
I love it,

15:31.458 --> 15:33.875
but don't forget
the show is entertainment,

15:33.958 --> 15:37.375
to get people out of their heads
by serving as a distraction.

15:37.458 --> 15:41.458
No, the show is about the weather.
It's not a distraction.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.750
Okay, tell me who else
has a screen like that,

15:43.833 --> 15:46.750
a globe, a band, Mery reading tweets,

15:46.833 --> 15:48.708
a unique host like yourself.

15:48.791 --> 15:52.416
Tell me. Because otherwise,
we're delivering the same information

15:52.500 --> 15:53.833
as every other weather show.

15:53.916 --> 15:56.666
No. My information is unique.
I put in the work.

15:56.750 --> 15:59.416
That's why people believe me.
Apps are wrong, I'm not.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.166
Do you know who you're producing?

16:01.250 --> 16:04.125
I know who I'm producing.
You're number one.

16:04.208 --> 16:07.250
-So?
-I do all this to make you happy.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.166
-Are you happy?
-No, you've upset me.

16:09.250 --> 16:11.833
Got anything not from Córdoba?
Córdoba, Jujuy, same thing.

16:11.916 --> 16:14.125
-What do you mean?
-Relax, he doesn't know jack.

16:14.208 --> 16:16.500
No, Córdoba's not-- They're not the same!

16:16.583 --> 16:22.291
I was relaxed, I wanted to focus, warm up.
You threw me off, you're killing me.

16:22.375 --> 16:24.208
-Can you calm down?
-No, I can't.

16:24.291 --> 16:26.833
I want you to relax, don't get upset.

16:26.916 --> 16:29.541
The girl and the dog
are on a trial period, okay?

16:33.041 --> 16:37.833
Light to moderate winds
in the west region.

16:37.916 --> 16:40.166
-Great. Good luck, handsome.
-Thanks, lovely.

16:42.333 --> 16:43.333
Where's the wolf?

16:44.041 --> 16:45.250
Careful, it's hot.

16:48.250 --> 16:50.208
-For fuck's sake!
-What happened?

16:50.291 --> 16:53.166
-I burnt myself!
-I said it's hot.

16:53.250 --> 16:55.541
-Now look.
-Look at this blister.

16:56.166 --> 16:57.875
We're ready.

16:57.958 --> 17:00.125
Great, "We're ready." Look at this.

17:02.041 --> 17:03.166
Is it swollen?

17:03.250 --> 17:06.166
No. God, Miguel. You look great.

17:07.833 --> 17:11.500
A cable car fell in Salta.
The news is reporting high casualties.

17:11.583 --> 17:13.458
-No.
-How are you?

17:13.541 --> 17:14.375
Good.

17:14.458 --> 17:15.333
-You're sure?
-Yes.

17:15.416 --> 17:17.625
-Ready, Miguel?
-Yes.

17:17.708 --> 17:18.625
Yes, I'm great.

17:18.708 --> 17:20.500
Let's shine. This is your day.

17:20.583 --> 17:22.833
-Give it your best.
-Let's go.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.791
<i>Rolling, standby. Action.</i>

17:24.875 --> 17:27.041
<i>From Buenos Aires, Argentina,</i>

17:27.125 --> 17:30.416
<i>comes the first national weather show.</i>

17:30.916 --> 17:34.583
<i>With you tonight, the amazing weather man,</i>

17:35.291 --> 17:38.875
<i>the man that brings gods to their knees.</i>

17:38.958 --> 17:40.666
Did Miguel write that?

17:40.750 --> 17:44.541
Yes, he was inspired by the introduction
to Apollo in <i>Rocky IV.</i>

17:46.166 --> 17:47.625
<i>Here is,</i>

17:48.250 --> 17:50.625
<i>Miguel Flores!</i>

17:51.583 --> 17:55.500
<i>Here comes Miguel</i>

17:55.583 --> 17:58.125
<i>Miguel knows, Miguel gets it right</i>

17:58.208 --> 18:00.250
<i>If he says so, wear a jacket</i>

18:00.333 --> 18:02.916
<i>If Miguel says rain is coming</i>

18:03.000 --> 18:05.125
<i>Don't be stubborn, bring an umbrella</i>

18:05.208 --> 18:06.500

<i>Here comes Miguel</i>

18:11.958 --> 18:13.750
<i>Miguel is here</i>

18:16.958 --> 18:19.416
Welcome to <i>The Great Weather Show.</i>

18:20.083 --> 18:23.291
<i>The first weather show</i>
<i>in Argentinian television.</i>

18:23.375 --> 18:24.833
<i>It's amazing.</i>

18:24.916 --> 18:29.208
<i>How did no one think</i>
<i>to make a show about the weather?</i>

18:29.291 --> 18:32.000
-I think--
-What's wrong, grandpa?

18:32.083 --> 18:35.833
-Get this moron off.
-Dad will kill me if I change it.

18:35.916 --> 18:37.166
<i>Many people ask me,</i>

18:37.250 --> 18:40.625
<i>"Miguel, why make a show about the weather</i>
<i>if I can get that on my phone?"</i>

18:41.541 --> 18:43.791
<i>Here, we're going to show them those apps</i>

18:44.416 --> 18:45.541

18:45.625 --> 18:46.500
<i>our whole lives.</i>

18:48.166 --> 18:49.791
God damn it!

18:50.875 --> 18:51.833
Luis!

18:52.541 --> 18:53.500
What's wrong?

18:53.583 --> 18:54.458
<i>What's next?</i>

18:54.541 --> 18:55.375
Look at me!

18:55.458 --> 18:59.375
A religion where God
is a 1,500 gigabyte smartphone?

19:00.208 --> 19:01.458
Careful, okay?

19:02.291 --> 19:06.125
It might not be a bad idea to renew
your faith just by recharging a battery.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.333
I adjusted it the other day.

19:11.416 --> 19:13.166
But you can't fix it by adjusting.

19:13.250 --> 19:15.583
You have to change the tap,
the spout, everything.

19:15.666 --> 19:17.625
Marisa, worry about the chicken.

19:17.708 --> 19:19.666
I'll wash the tomatoes in the bathroom.

19:19.750 --> 19:21.000
That's your solution?

19:21.083 --> 19:22.958
I'm fed up.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.333
How much is the liquid you use
for the tires?

19:31.083 --> 19:32.250
Not much.

19:32.333 --> 19:33.958
Can you listen to me?

19:34.041 --> 19:36.541
I am, Marisa, relax a bit.

19:37.208 --> 19:39.791
It's Miguel Flores' first show.

19:39.875 --> 19:43.000
I'd like to at least listen to it.
Is that too much to ask?

19:43.083 --> 19:45.416
Does it matter more than the kitchen sink?

19:45.500 --> 19:48.750
-Does what matter more?
-The liquid, Luis.

19:49.666 --> 19:53.416
Yes, it matters more.
It's a tool for my work.

19:53.500 --> 19:54.333
Done.

19:54.916 --> 19:55.750
Done.

19:56.833 --> 19:58.166
How are the ratings?

19:58.250 --> 20:00.458
Great. Peaks of 17 points.

20:00.958 --> 20:02.583
Channel 12 is at 11.

20:02.666 --> 20:03.791
Yes, Miguel.

20:03.875 --> 20:07.041
Didn't I say he was a genius?
Come on, Miguelito.

20:07.125 --> 20:09.541
I have great news
for Buenos Aires citizens.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.291
Tonight and tomorrow night

20:11.375 --> 20:14.666
will be completely clear,
high of 22 degrees.

20:14.750 --> 20:17.291
I, Miguel Flores, The Infallible,

20:17.375 --> 20:18.666
guarantee it.

20:20.208 --> 20:21.875
This chicken is like a rock.

20:22.500 --> 20:25.875
Twenty percent chance of storms
at 2:00 a.m. it says.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.041
No, those apps are never right.

20:28.125 --> 20:30.875
Yesterday they said "rain all day."
Not a drop.

20:30.958 --> 20:31.791
Not a drop.

20:31.875 --> 20:34.625
Your dad believes the TV comedian
more than science.

20:34.708 --> 20:39.250
Comedian? Miguel Flores studied this
for six years.

20:39.333 --> 20:40.375
He always says so.

20:40.458 --> 20:43.083
Goddamn chicken!

20:43.166 --> 20:44.625
Anyway, Luis,

20:44.708 --> 20:47.916
why don't you put the taxi in the garage,
just in case?

20:48.000 --> 20:51.083
Tonight's clear. Didn't you hear?
Is the volume off?

20:51.166 --> 20:52.166
Do what you want.

20:52.250 --> 20:55.083
Like always, you end up doing
whatever you want.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.000
That's it.

20:56.083 --> 20:57.916
-What do you mean?
-It's bullshit.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.791
-Washing tomatoes in the bathroom.
-She said "bullshit."

21:03.083 --> 21:06.666
I spent nine hours today in that taxi.
Nine hours.

21:06.750 --> 21:09.583
The first passenger brought me downtown.

21:09.666 --> 21:11.791
The main street was closed for a protest.

21:11.875 --> 21:14.583
I ate a ham and cheese sandwich for lunch

21:14.666 --> 21:16.125
while stopped at red lights.

21:16.208 --> 21:19.416
I made less than 1,500 pesos
and you want me to spend 700

21:19.500 --> 21:22.333
on a parking spot 15 blocks away.

21:24.041 --> 21:26.250
Why are you groaning so much, Dad?

21:26.333 --> 21:27.666
You sound like a dog.

21:29.458 --> 21:31.375
Okay, this is over.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.958
Let's see what the dog eats now.

21:35.875 --> 21:38.500
-See, it's the other one.
-God.

21:38.583 --> 21:41.291
You always have to be right.

21:41.375 --> 21:43.375
-And you don't?
-No.

21:43.458 --> 21:45.541
You love winning.

21:45.625 --> 21:47.208
And tonight, you won.

21:47.291 --> 21:49.916
You won big, Infallible One.

21:50.625 --> 21:52.000
Heart-stopping,

21:52.583 --> 21:53.541
inflammable.

21:54.916 --> 21:57.916
-Should we go to the room?
-I want to say hi to Osvaldo.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.416
-Osvaldito? Okay.
-Just a second.

22:00.500 --> 22:02.958
-I'll be waiting in your room.
-Coming, Osvaldo.

22:03.625 --> 22:05.125
Hey.

22:05.208 --> 22:06.625
Hey, Osvaldito.

22:06.708 --> 22:07.875
Osvaldo, where are you?

22:09.875 --> 22:11.291
I did well today, Osvaldito.

22:11.791 --> 22:12.958
I did well.

22:13.041 --> 22:15.083
Nineteen point two in ratings.

22:15.166 --> 22:16.166
I'm so happy.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.125
Kisses, until tomorrow. Sleep tight.

22:50.500 --> 22:51.541
What's wrong, Luis?

22:53.125 --> 22:55.625
-No, stop.
-Come here.

23:46.708 --> 23:48.625
No!

23:49.416 --> 23:50.250
No.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.208
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

23:57.041 --> 23:59.458
I told you to put the car away.

23:59.541 --> 24:02.208
Don't say, "I told you so,"
for fuck's sake!

24:02.291 --> 24:04.041
We're going to get killed.

24:04.125 --> 24:05.958
He promised!

24:07.291 --> 24:09.333
He said clear skies.

24:09.416 --> 24:11.916
He's an idiot.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.041
An idiot!

24:13.708 --> 24:15.250
Come inside, Luis.

24:15.333 --> 24:16.791
Come inside, damn it.

24:45.833 --> 24:47.208
Hi.

24:48.166 --> 24:49.208
Good morning.

24:54.791 --> 24:56.500
-What time is it?
-9:30.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.166
What time?

24:59.333 --> 25:00.958
9:30.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.250
How?

25:02.333 --> 25:05.041
Didn't I tell you to wake me up at 8:30?

25:05.125 --> 25:07.833
I know, but you were sleeping
so peacefully, I couldn't.

25:07.916 --> 25:09.625
-Your coffee.
-Thanks.

25:09.708 --> 25:11.375
How are you?

25:11.458 --> 25:13.458
-Good. There you go.
-Thanks.

25:33.291 --> 25:34.958
Did you water the plants?

25:35.041 --> 25:35.875
What?

25:37.333 --> 25:40.083
Did you water the plants by the window?

25:40.583 --> 25:41.416
No.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.083
I'm going to be so late.

25:44.166 --> 25:47.625
I slept horribly. The storm woke me
and I couldn't go back to sleep.

25:49.208 --> 25:50.333
What storm?

25:50.416 --> 25:52.458
Around 3:00 a.m. It rained like crazy.

25:53.541 --> 25:55.250
Okay, will I see you tonight?

25:56.875 --> 25:58.916
Call me and we'll do something tonight.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.208
Yeah. Bye.

27:46.791 --> 27:48.958
-No, sorry.
-Son of a bitch.

27:49.041 --> 27:51.666
Oh, Miguelito, you really fucked up.

27:51.750 --> 27:53.791
-Elvira.
-What are you going to do?

27:53.875 --> 27:54.791
It's okay, Elvira.

27:54.875 --> 27:57.041

28:01.333 --> 28:03.000
-Stop.
-Miguel, they'll lynch you.

28:03.541 --> 28:04.375
My God.

28:06.166 --> 28:07.125

<i>Someone from the National Weather Service,</i>

28:40.000 --> 28:43.500

28:43.583 --> 28:46.250
I have to take a detour,
the road's blocked ahead.

28:46.333 --> 28:47.958

No.

29:52.916 --> 29:55.458
-Logan 2020.
-2020, yes.

29:55.541 --> 29:57.541
- License plate BA477
- CB.

29:58.041 --> 29:59.083
Right.

30:00.208 --> 30:03.916
Your policy doesn't cover hail damage.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.625
It does. Look again,
it's all risks insurance.

30:07.708 --> 30:08.750
Yes, of course.

30:10.208 --> 30:13.208
"All risks" is a title.

30:15.291 --> 30:16.500
What do you mean?

30:17.250 --> 30:20.208
Did you read the fine print?

30:20.750 --> 30:22.916
No, I didn't. I trusted you guys.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.750
I took out an all risks policy
and I figured "all" meant everything.

30:29.291 --> 30:30.458
Of course. Yeah.

30:31.666 --> 30:36.291
"All" means everything
except hail in this policy,

30:36.375 --> 30:39.791
but if you want, we can upgrade.
I can tell you how much it is.

30:41.750 --> 30:43.125
Listen, boy.

30:45.166 --> 30:47.000
I use my car for work.

30:48.500 --> 30:49.333
Of course.

30:53.583 --> 30:54.416
Of course.

31:01.083 --> 31:02.000
Of course.

31:04.333 --> 31:05.166
Here.

31:05.250 --> 31:07.625
No, it's okay. It's a company souvenir.

31:08.416 --> 31:09.583
Keep it.

31:10.916 --> 31:12.125
No. Take it.

31:34.166 --> 31:35.375
Morning, Domingo.

31:43.875 --> 31:44.791
Miguelito.

31:45.416 --> 31:47.583
-I brought you the pay slips.
-Great.

31:47.666 --> 31:49.458
-Sit down.
-Okay.

31:55.166 --> 31:57.125
What do you think of Itaparica?

31:57.208 --> 31:59.208
-What?
-Itaparica, Brazil.

31:59.291 --> 32:02.541
-I've never been.
-It's great. Below Bahia.

32:02.625 --> 32:06.041
Average temperature of 30 degrees,
speedos, caipiroska…

32:07.041 --> 32:09.458
The samba there is crazy.

32:09.541 --> 32:12.416
The whole happy Brazilian vibe
kind of annoys me.

32:12.500 --> 32:14.541
The network can get you
half-price tickets.

32:14.625 --> 32:16.291
Are you going on vacation?

32:16.375 --> 32:18.250
No. You're going.

32:19.625 --> 32:21.291
You really fucked up, Miguel.

32:23.166 --> 32:24.916
Look, you know me well.

32:25.416 --> 32:27.666
Gustavo, you know who I am, how I work.

32:28.166 --> 32:31.583
I analyzed the reports
down to the smallest detail.

32:32.250 --> 32:34.625
-I don't know what happened.
-You guaranteed it.

32:35.791 --> 32:36.958
"I guarantee it."

32:37.041 --> 32:39.500
Yes, that's true, but it's a catchphrase.

32:39.583 --> 32:43.375
-People love catchphrases.
-No, people love being entertained,

32:43.458 --> 32:46.750
clearing their heads,
forgetting their daily troubles.

32:46.833 --> 32:47.875
Remember I told you,

32:47.958 --> 32:50.208
"The show is for entertainment."

32:50.291 --> 32:51.916
It was simple, Miguel.

32:52.416 --> 32:55.541
Okay, I was wrong.
I was going to be wrong at some point.

32:55.625 --> 32:57.791
Gustavo, come on.
Have you never been wrong?

32:57.875 --> 33:00.916
How many bad shows
have you put on TV that didn't work?

33:01.000 --> 33:02.166
You're The Infallible.

33:03.375 --> 33:04.750
Right? <i>Rocky IV.</i>

33:06.500 --> 33:08.875
Isn't that right?
The Infallible can't be wrong.

33:09.708 --> 33:13.333
Do you have any idea
how much destruction this storm caused?

33:13.416 --> 33:16.083
Do you know how many viewers
who follow you daily

33:16.166 --> 33:18.833
lost their roofs, houses, cars,

33:18.916 --> 33:20.583
windows, whatever else?

33:20.666 --> 33:22.958
Of course, but they'll understand.

33:23.041 --> 33:25.250
Climate change is what's changed things.

33:25.333 --> 33:26.166
People know--

33:26.250 --> 33:28.541
No. People don't know shit.

33:28.625 --> 33:30.875
No, excuse me. People know.

33:31.583 --> 33:34.416
They know they'll have to spend money
they don't have

33:34.500 --> 33:36.833
fixing something that,
if you hadn't been wrong,

33:36.916 --> 33:38.250
they wouldn't have to fix.

33:38.333 --> 33:41.375
What are you saying?
The storm is my fault?

33:41.458 --> 33:43.083
What is that? No.

33:43.166 --> 33:45.125
What are you saying? I'm losing it?

33:45.208 --> 33:48.208
No, don't. Go to Itaparica.

33:48.291 --> 33:50.291
Don't go crazy. Take a vacation.

33:52.125 --> 33:53.541
Are you firing me?

33:53.625 --> 33:56.583
No. I just said
I'm giving you an early vacation.

33:57.458 --> 33:58.416
Then we'll see.

33:59.333 --> 34:03.833
You know people forget everything.
Soon, there'll be someone else to hate.

34:04.625 --> 34:06.208
Wait, Gustavo.

34:06.291 --> 34:08.083
You can't end the show.

34:08.166 --> 34:10.000
It's only had one episode.

34:10.083 --> 34:12.833
Of course. On that, we agree.

34:12.916 --> 34:14.416
The show will go on.

34:15.208 --> 34:17.375
The show will go on, but you won't.

34:25.458 --> 34:27.625
I can't believe this.

34:30.208 --> 34:34.416
How can one wrong prediction
be the end of a long career?

34:34.500 --> 34:36.541
A wrong prediction?

34:37.916 --> 34:40.875
-Have you seen social media?
-So? You know how people are.

34:40.958 --> 34:42.958
There's no accountability.

34:43.041 --> 34:44.875
Those people are our clients.

34:44.958 --> 34:46.916
They decide our future here.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.625
-They don't decide, you do.
-Okay, if you say so.

34:51.583 --> 34:52.708
They decide for me.

34:53.416 --> 34:55.625
We're a true democracy.

34:55.708 --> 34:58.125
They vote, I obey.

34:58.750 --> 35:00.166
Those are the rules.

35:00.250 --> 35:02.458
You should know that by now.

35:07.083 --> 35:08.916
I know what that means.

35:12.875 --> 35:15.833
I mean, of course. Right.

35:15.916 --> 35:18.333
You decide whether I stay or--

35:18.416 --> 35:21.791
Well, no. They decide for you.

35:21.875 --> 35:23.750
Sorry for asking. Lately,

35:24.625 --> 35:27.041
it's hard to understand how things work.

35:35.333 --> 35:36.916
Yes, I'm going to the studio.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.875
But I don't have a helicopter, okay?

35:40.083 --> 35:41.458
Carmencita.

35:41.541 --> 35:42.583
Yes?

35:43.583 --> 35:45.458
Silence, we're recording.

36:33.791 --> 36:37.416
You knew, right?
That's why you acted different.

36:43.083 --> 36:44.166
You knew.

36:46.041 --> 36:47.166

37:05.958 --> 37:07.541
No, don't. What is that?

37:07.625 --> 37:10.125
A flower remedy, it's good for you. There.

<i>That kiss is for you.</i>

37:49.416 --> 37:50.625
Good. This is good.

37:50.708 --> 37:52.416
What? I'm healthier than ever.

37:52.500 --> 37:53.500
Sons of bitches.

37:53.583 --> 37:55.583
Calm down. This isn't good for you.

37:55.666 --> 37:58.500
This isn't good for me. This fake news.

37:58.583 --> 37:59.875
My God. What's going on?

37:59.958 --> 38:01.625
Seriously. What's happening?

38:01.708 --> 38:05.541
People on the street used to say
they loved me. They know me.

38:05.625 --> 38:06.458
Yes.

38:06.541 --> 38:09.125
Now I'm guilty of everything.

38:09.208 --> 38:10.541
I'm a public schmuck.

38:10.625 --> 38:12.750
-A fucking meme.
-No.

38:12.833 --> 38:15.666
<i>When life gets tough, weather the storm.</i>

38:15.750 --> 38:17.875
No.

38:19.458 --> 38:21.375
-My phone.
-Here it is.

38:21.458 --> 38:23.916
-No, that's it.
-Calm down.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.250
No, I've had enough.

38:26.333 --> 38:28.375
I-- No. Not this.

38:28.458 --> 38:29.833
Now they'll hear me.

38:31.416 --> 38:33.833
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Hi. Put me through to Gustavo.

38:33.916 --> 38:37.375
-<i>Who's this?</i>
-You know who this is. Don't play dumb.

38:37.458 --> 38:39.125
-Put--
-<i>Gustavo's in the studio.</i>

38:39.208 --> 38:42.583
He's not in the studio, he's next to you.
Don't lie to me.

38:42.666 --> 38:43.708
<i>He just left.</i>

38:43.791 --> 38:44.625
I--

38:45.208 --> 38:46.541
Let me clarify,

38:46.625 --> 38:49.375
this show on the air
is mine and you know it.

38:49.458 --> 38:51.291
I created this show.

38:51.375 --> 38:52.250
Hello?

38:52.333 --> 38:55.333
-She hung up. Son of a bitch.
-Relax.

38:55.416 --> 38:56.541
-Stop.
-She hung up!

38:56.625 --> 38:58.333
-She hung up!
-Miguel.

38:58.416 --> 39:00.791
Calm down.
You're gonna have a heart attack.

39:00.875 --> 39:01.708
What do you mean?

39:03.166 --> 39:04.250
-What's that?
-Hang on.

39:04.333 --> 39:06.625
-It's a stuffed animal.
-What?

39:06.708 --> 39:09.250
Who threw this shit?

39:09.333 --> 39:12.041
-What is that?
-Calm down, Miguel.

39:12.125 --> 39:14.625
-Don't touch it. It might be a bomb.
-Stop.

39:17.416 --> 39:20.666
-It's ketchup, not blood.
-Ketchup? Who threw it?

39:21.291 --> 39:22.583
-Who was it?
-Babe, wait.

39:22.666 --> 39:24.625
Who threw this? And why?

39:24.708 --> 39:25.625
Who is it?

39:26.166 --> 39:27.000
Huh?

39:27.666 --> 39:28.750
Careful.

39:34.250 --> 39:35.500
-Inside, Miguel.
-Yeah.

39:35.583 --> 39:36.541
But why?

39:38.708 --> 39:39.541
But--

39:46.041 --> 39:48.083
-Come on, Miguel.
-What was that?

39:52.625 --> 39:54.333
F YOU, FLORES
RETIRE, DEAD MAN

39:54.416 --> 39:56.500
Fuck you, Flores.

39:56.583 --> 39:57.416
CANCELED

39:57.500 --> 39:58.666
Flores, you asshole.

39:58.750 --> 39:59.750
Come out, Miguel.

39:59.833 --> 40:01.833
Fuck you!

40:01.916 --> 40:04.625
-Come down here, Flores.
-Fuck you, Flores!

40:05.291 --> 40:07.083
-I'm here, Miguel.
-Okay.

40:07.166 --> 40:09.291
-Ready?
-You put the car in the garage?

40:09.375 --> 40:11.750
The woman wouldn't let me.
I had to pay her.

40:11.833 --> 40:14.083
-Really?
-You told her to hang her clothes outside.

40:14.166 --> 40:16.958
Unbelievable. What a terrible woman.

40:17.041 --> 40:20.791
I gave her everything.
Videos for her and her family, autographs.

40:20.875 --> 40:21.708
Enough.

40:21.791 --> 40:23.583
You know what people are like.

40:23.666 --> 40:25.666
-We're going to be late.
-Yes.

40:25.750 --> 40:28.958
-How can I help?
-No, that's it. Worry about the fish.

40:29.041 --> 40:30.583
Put him in a bag with water.

40:30.666 --> 40:32.250
Osvaldo's going too?

40:32.333 --> 40:34.583
What did you say? Osvaldo? What?

40:34.666 --> 40:36.666
Where I go, Osvaldo goes.

40:36.750 --> 40:38.666
-Okay.
-But--

40:38.750 --> 40:41.666
Fuck you, Flores.

40:42.583 --> 40:48.041
Fuck you, Flores.

40:50.333 --> 40:52.750
We're getting away, Miguel.

40:57.458 --> 40:58.750
Are you okay, Miguel?

41:00.041 --> 41:01.958
Listen to yourself, Maxi.

41:11.708 --> 41:13.208
We're almost there.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.625
Slow down, moron.

41:16.708 --> 41:17.791
Sorry.

41:18.916 --> 41:20.791
We're almost there, love.

41:41.041 --> 41:42.541
You're white as a ghost.

41:43.083 --> 41:44.333
Why wouldn't I be?

41:44.833 --> 41:45.958
I couldn't breathe.

41:46.625 --> 41:48.375
Take Osvaldito, please.

41:48.458 --> 41:50.208
-Take Osvaldo.
-Okay.

41:50.291 --> 41:52.791
-How's everything here?
-Good.

41:52.875 --> 41:53.958
Okay, listen.

41:54.041 --> 41:55.333
-Pay attention.
-Okay.

41:55.416 --> 41:57.416
Call Gerónimo Martens.

41:57.500 --> 42:00.833
Tell him to check me in quick, VIP. Okay?

42:00.916 --> 42:03.000
-You told Martens?
-I called him.

42:03.083 --> 42:05.083
I called him and he didn't answer.

42:05.166 --> 42:06.958
He must be busy.

42:07.041 --> 42:09.166
-Okay, hurry. Let's go.
-Okay.

42:13.416 --> 42:15.708
-Come on.
-Yeah, it's him.

42:36.083 --> 42:37.166
Morning.

42:41.833 --> 42:43.041
Jorge, coffee, please.

42:43.125 --> 42:44.541
With a lid. To go.

42:44.625 --> 42:46.916
-Okay.
-And three pastries, your pick.

42:48.083 --> 42:49.791
Jorge sells ice cream, Luis.

42:50.541 --> 42:52.333
You should order some shaved ice.

42:54.916 --> 42:57.000
Don't get mad, dude. It's a joke.

42:58.041 --> 43:00.541
What's wrong? Did The Infallible fail?

43:01.166 --> 43:02.416
You know why that happened?

43:03.250 --> 43:04.958
You have to check your phone.

43:08.166 --> 43:11.833
-Aldo, why didn't you check?
-What?

43:12.541 --> 43:13.458
Your phone.

43:14.083 --> 43:15.833
Don't you see your car's fucked up?

43:15.916 --> 43:17.166
My car's fine.

43:18.083 --> 43:19.000
Fine?

43:20.125 --> 43:21.875
Now it's fine.

43:21.958 --> 43:23.750
What are you doing? Motherfucker.

43:23.833 --> 43:26.750
-I'll kill you.
-Get away.

43:28.166 --> 43:30.750
-Why am I in line?
-Because Martens isn't here.

43:30.833 --> 43:32.750
-Why not?
-"Because."

43:32.833 --> 43:36.916
How about this? Get in the line
for crew members and diplomats,

43:37.000 --> 43:37.958
it'll be fine.

43:38.041 --> 43:40.583
-Why?
-Because you're Miguel Flores.

43:40.666 --> 43:41.833
-Stop.
-Okay.

43:41.916 --> 43:44.416
-Call me when you get to Córdoba.
-Okay.

43:44.500 --> 43:46.166
-Take care, I'll miss you.
-Okay.

43:46.708 --> 43:47.791
Enough, Maxi.

43:52.375 --> 43:53.291
How are you?

43:54.083 --> 43:55.916
-Go ahead.
-Thanks.

44:02.208 --> 44:04.583
Scarf, glasses, hat, and watch, please.

44:04.666 --> 44:06.166
I don't have any metal.

44:06.250 --> 44:08.541
-The watch is metal.
-You're right.

44:13.291 --> 44:14.125
Everything.

44:16.208 --> 44:17.291
I have pharyngitis.

44:19.458 --> 44:20.291
Go, Flores.

44:21.541 --> 44:22.375
Thanks.

44:41.708 --> 44:43.083
We're close, Osvaldito.

44:43.166 --> 44:44.791
We're close, love.

44:46.625 --> 44:47.458
We're close.

44:49.625 --> 44:52.250
RESTROOM

44:54.500 --> 44:56.083
You broke two of my windows.

44:56.166 --> 44:58.708
Thirty thousand pesos per window.
Here's my bank info.

45:23.541 --> 45:24.500
Dumbass.

45:30.833 --> 45:33.500
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>welcome to the city of Córdoba,</i>

45:41.041 --> 45:42.333
Are you free?

45:42.416 --> 45:44.541
-Flores, how are you? Get in.
-Okay.

46:26.250 --> 46:27.708
You're back, dude.

46:28.708 --> 46:30.500
You screwed over Buenos Aires.

47:13.041 --> 47:13.958
Dad?

47:14.500 --> 47:16.958
-What are you doing here?
-You asked me to come.

47:17.041 --> 47:18.291
I did?

47:18.375 --> 47:20.083
To deal with the house, Carla.

47:20.166 --> 47:22.375
But you never answered my messages.

47:22.458 --> 47:23.500
Here I am.

47:25.083 --> 47:28.041
I heard what happened, Dad.
It's everywhere.

47:28.125 --> 47:29.666
It's crazy.

47:30.375 --> 47:32.375
I don't want to be naive.

47:32.458 --> 47:34.083
Did you come here to hide?

47:34.166 --> 47:38.208
-No, how could you say that? No.
-What is that?

47:38.291 --> 47:40.541
Osvaldito. I never told you about him?

47:40.625 --> 47:42.625
Osval-- You never told me, no.

47:43.125 --> 47:45.541
I'm in a rush.
I have to go to the hospital.

47:45.625 --> 47:47.875
Get a hotel and I'll call you.

47:47.958 --> 47:50.416
-Wait.
-Ah, the X-ray!

47:51.083 --> 47:52.750
No, I have it here.

47:54.791 --> 47:56.083
You're still here?

47:56.166 --> 47:58.458
Go to the hotel, Dad. I'll call you.

47:58.541 --> 48:01.041
I can't stay in a hotel
because of the incident.

48:02.833 --> 48:06.000
And you say you're not here to hide.
Unbelievable.

48:06.083 --> 48:08.041
I came to see you too.

48:08.125 --> 48:09.208
-Yeah.
-Okay.

48:09.291 --> 48:12.541
I thought I could stay in your room,
from when you were a kid.

48:13.041 --> 48:15.458
-I'm using it for storage.
-But you kept the bed?

48:15.541 --> 48:16.708
It's covered in stuff.

48:16.791 --> 48:20.250
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
Go to work, it's fine.

48:22.375 --> 48:24.708
There's a second set of keys
above the fridge.

48:24.791 --> 48:26.625
Thanks, sweetie. Have a nice day.

48:26.708 --> 48:28.666
-Everything will be fine.
-Bye.

48:52.416 --> 48:54.416
NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF CÓRDOBA

48:56.500 --> 48:57.500
THANKS, CARLA

49:00.041 --> 49:02.416
THANK YOU FOR TAKING CARE OF ME
YOU'RE GREAT

49:43.166 --> 49:45.875
<i>Careful, it might start any second now.</i>

49:45.958 --> 49:48.166
<i>-Is that okay?</i>
<i>-No, it's--</i>

49:48.250 --> 49:49.833
<i>-To the left.</i>
<i>-That way?</i>

49:49.916 --> 49:51.458
<i>Do you need more light?</i>

49:51.541 --> 49:52.666
<i>A little further back.</i>

50:26.666 --> 50:28.375
<i>Andy, it's today's big news.</i>

50:28.458 --> 50:30.500
<i>-It's trending, María.</i>
<i>-Totally.</i>

50:30.583 --> 50:34.833
<i>Mery Oliva and the production keep saying</i>
<i>Miguel's sick.</i>

50:34.916 --> 50:37.958
<i>I don't want to be mean.</i>
<i>I like Miguel, really.</i>

50:38.041 --> 50:39.791
<i>I followed his predictions daily.</i>

50:39.875 --> 50:43.208
<i>-"Followed"? Past tense?</i>
<i>-Yes. Want to see my car?</i>

50:43.291 --> 50:46.500
<i>I have to say, Miguel fled like a rat</i>
<i>in a storm.</i>

50:46.583 --> 50:50.333
<i>This photo sent in from a listener</i>
<i>at the airport confirms it.</i>

50:50.416 --> 50:52.916
<i>-What's in his hand?</i>
<i>-A fish, María.</i>

50:53.000 --> 50:55.125
<i>The only friend he has left, a fish.</i>

50:55.208 --> 50:56.375
Son of a bitch.

51:04.333 --> 51:05.291
Dad?

51:06.583 --> 51:07.500
Yes?

51:11.125 --> 51:12.083
What is this?

51:12.166 --> 51:14.333
I bought a fish tank.

51:14.416 --> 51:16.250
It was 30% off.

51:16.333 --> 51:18.208
Come on, say hi to your sister.

51:18.291 --> 51:20.958
No, all of this. Did you clean?

51:21.708 --> 51:23.916
Oh, yeah. It was a little messy.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.083
-Yes.
-Okay.

51:25.166 --> 51:26.041
Messy?

51:26.125 --> 51:28.916
-This is my mess, and I understand it.
-Okay.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.666
Where's the Physiology VI book
that was in that corner?

51:31.750 --> 51:34.250
-The red book is here.
-No, not here.

51:34.333 --> 51:36.708
-Don't move my things.
-Okay.

51:36.791 --> 51:39.291
-Please.
-Sure. No problem.

51:39.791 --> 51:41.666
Where are you going?

51:43.291 --> 51:46.000
To buy some food. Excuse me, I'm famished.

51:46.083 --> 51:49.250
You don't need to. Dad made your favorite.

51:49.333 --> 51:50.625
Noodles and pink sauce

51:50.708 --> 51:52.916
with sausage Bolognese.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.708
Wash your hands, come on.

51:58.208 --> 52:00.458
Getting on prime time is a goal--

52:01.291 --> 52:02.291
You're bored.

52:03.333 --> 52:05.166
Oh, no.

52:05.250 --> 52:06.458
That was a big yawn.

52:07.625 --> 52:09.125
No, I'm tired, Dad.

52:09.208 --> 52:11.916
I've been up since 6:00 a.m.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.333
Of course, right.

52:14.333 --> 52:15.625
What was I going to say?

52:15.708 --> 52:17.541
-About prime time--
-No.

52:18.958 --> 52:20.291
Oh, the notary.

52:21.250 --> 52:24.333
I'll call him tomorrow
and set up an appointment ASAP

52:24.416 --> 52:26.916
so we can get
this inheritance thing settled.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.291
-Perfect.
-Okay.

52:30.416 --> 52:31.875
What'd you want to do with the house?

52:34.458 --> 52:35.291
Sell it.

52:37.041 --> 52:38.000
Where would you go?

52:38.916 --> 52:39.750
I don't know.

52:42.666 --> 52:45.375
There's so much history in this house.

52:46.291 --> 52:47.958
It was your grandpa Domingo's.

52:48.041 --> 52:50.916
Do you remember him? He loved you so much.

52:51.750 --> 52:54.041
He'd always say,
"Don't try to change Carla."

52:54.541 --> 52:55.708
He loved you.

52:57.875 --> 52:59.125
And this is the only

53:00.000 --> 53:01.750
thing he left your mom.

53:01.833 --> 53:02.750
The only thing.

53:04.583 --> 53:05.583
What?

53:07.000 --> 53:10.083
Are you trying to guilt me
about wanting to sell?

53:10.166 --> 53:11.916
No, what are you saying?

53:12.000 --> 53:13.333
It seemed like it.

53:13.416 --> 53:16.291
No, not at all. But I can't lie.

53:16.375 --> 53:17.958
I thought you'd stay here.

53:19.041 --> 53:21.083
-Yeah, and have a family.
-No.

53:21.166 --> 53:23.166
-I'm not interested in that.
-No?

53:24.041 --> 53:24.875
No.

53:25.791 --> 53:28.291
-Leave it, I'll wash it.
-No, I will.

53:44.583 --> 53:46.708
How's Mauro? Are you still seeing him?

53:47.333 --> 53:48.166
Marcelo?

53:48.916 --> 53:49.750
Marcelo.

53:50.291 --> 53:52.666
It must be Marcelo,
I don't know any Mauros.

53:52.750 --> 53:54.791
-Why did I say Mauro?
-I don't know.

53:54.875 --> 53:57.041
I don't know any Mauros either.

53:57.958 --> 53:59.041
Are you still dating?

53:59.666 --> 54:00.500
No.

54:01.833 --> 54:02.875
Why?

54:04.291 --> 54:05.125
I got bored.

54:05.625 --> 54:07.291
That's a shame, I liked him.

54:07.375 --> 54:09.625
You didn't like Marcelo, Dad. Please.

54:09.708 --> 54:13.208
You only met him once.
You spent the whole meal-- Remember?

54:13.291 --> 54:17.333
You spent the whole time talking about
yourself and your weather success.

54:17.416 --> 54:18.333
You don't know him.

54:19.000 --> 54:19.833
Okay.

54:22.916 --> 54:26.416
-You dating anyone now?
-No.

54:28.375 --> 54:30.583
You decided to focus on your career.

54:30.666 --> 54:32.291
Yes. Like you.

54:34.458 --> 54:37.166
You go through phases.

54:37.250 --> 54:38.875
-It's not a phase.
-You'll see.

54:38.958 --> 54:41.125
Eventually, you'll want a child.

54:41.208 --> 54:42.125
No.

54:42.958 --> 54:45.750
I'm not going to want kids.
I'm not interested.

54:45.833 --> 54:47.708
You say that now. Wait five years.

54:47.791 --> 54:49.708
I'll feel the same.

54:49.791 --> 54:51.708
I'm not interested, Dad.

54:51.791 --> 54:52.958
You're a pediatrician.

54:53.041 --> 54:53.875
And?

54:53.958 --> 54:57.041
-And your job is to treat kids.
-Other people's kids.

54:57.125 --> 54:58.500
That already exist.

54:58.583 --> 55:01.416
They're already here, I didn't birth them.

55:01.500 --> 55:03.500
Someone has to treat them.

55:04.041 --> 55:07.375
You wanted to do the dishes?
Do them. I need to lie down.

55:13.958 --> 55:14.916
Dad.

55:18.041 --> 55:18.958
Doesn't this seem

55:20.333 --> 55:22.666
strange to you? Weird?

55:22.750 --> 55:25.333
-What?
-This. You and me.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.250
I feel like when I talk to you,

55:29.333 --> 55:30.541
I don't know you,

55:30.625 --> 55:34.375
I feel like I'm talking to an acquaintance
I see once in a while.

55:35.375 --> 55:38.750
But I don't feel
like I'm talking to my dad.

55:44.000 --> 55:45.041
I don't.

55:51.333 --> 55:52.875
Thanks for dinner anyway.

56:10.875 --> 56:11.875
How's it going?

56:12.583 --> 56:14.458
Are you the concierge?

56:14.541 --> 56:16.291
No, I was walking by,

56:16.375 --> 56:20.375
I saw all this dog shit
and I thought I should clean up.

56:22.833 --> 56:24.500
Miguel Flores lives here, right?

56:24.583 --> 56:25.750
Are you another friend?

56:25.833 --> 56:27.166
-Yes.
-What'd he break?

56:29.083 --> 56:30.125
My car.

56:32.583 --> 56:33.416
Is he here?

56:34.208 --> 56:35.291
Or is he gone?

56:39.291 --> 56:41.333
On TV they say he went to Córdoba.

56:44.916 --> 56:45.791
Is it true?

56:46.291 --> 56:47.250
Yes.

56:47.333 --> 56:49.958
He has a daughter there named Carla.

56:50.708 --> 56:52.000
Know where she lives?

56:52.083 --> 56:53.375
I don't know, dude.

56:53.458 --> 56:57.000
She's a pediatrician.
She works at a public hospital.

56:57.083 --> 57:00.583
That was two years ago.
I don't know if that's changed.

57:00.666 --> 57:01.875
Carla?

57:01.958 --> 57:02.791
Yes, Carla.

57:02.875 --> 57:04.958
Dude, move. You're holding me up.

57:05.041 --> 57:08.875
I have to finish cleaning. Go on, dude.

57:08.958 --> 57:11.000
Come on, go.

57:18.833 --> 57:20.041
Good morning.

57:20.125 --> 57:21.208
Good morning, doctor.

57:21.291 --> 57:22.916
How'd the champ sleep?

57:23.500 --> 57:24.875
Good, he slept well.

57:24.958 --> 57:26.291
-He's a little sore.
-Yeah?

57:26.375 --> 57:27.666
-From the operation.
-Yes.

57:27.750 --> 57:30.375
It's all so recent. Here, sit up a bit.

57:31.333 --> 57:33.583
Tomorrow we'll have the lab results

57:33.666 --> 57:35.125
and we'll see how to proceed.

57:35.208 --> 57:38.000
The important thing
is that this guy is comfortable.

57:38.083 --> 57:40.208
You haven't heard about his results yet?

57:41.041 --> 57:42.500
We have to wait for tomorrow.

57:42.583 --> 57:45.916
<i>What's clear is that</i>
<i>he's not happy with production</i>

57:46.000 --> 57:48.166
<i>and it seems he's leaving. We'll see.</i>

57:48.250 --> 57:50.625
<i>-Miguel Flores?</i>
<i>-Yes, he's here in Córdoba.</i>

57:50.708 --> 57:52.708
-Mom, Miguel.
-<i>Back to his roots.</i>

57:52.791 --> 57:54.416
<i>Or is he in hiding?</i>

57:54.500 --> 57:55.541
<i>Why?</i>

57:55.625 --> 57:58.666
<i>People who have seen him here in Córdoba</i>

57:58.750 --> 58:01.833
<i>say he's in perfect health.</i>

58:01.916 --> 58:05.500
<i>This whole sick leave thing</i>
<i>seems like an excuse.</i>

58:05.583 --> 58:08.500
-Did they fire Miguel?
-Seems like it.

58:09.458 --> 58:12.500
-He's a fan of Miguel Flores.
-Really?

58:12.583 --> 58:14.541
He wants to be a meteorologist.

58:23.250 --> 58:25.250
-Maxi.
-How are you?

58:25.333 --> 58:27.208
At my best.

58:27.291 --> 58:28.333
What's up?

58:28.416 --> 58:31.083
I had to pick up the drops
from the pharmacy.

58:31.166 --> 58:33.541
I'll go today and send them to Córdoba.

58:33.625 --> 58:36.958
Move a little, you have no waist.
You're fat. Swim.

58:37.041 --> 58:39.541
-What?
-No, I'm talking to Osvaldito.

58:39.625 --> 58:40.541
So?

58:40.625 --> 58:43.208
What should I do with
your stuff backstage?

58:43.291 --> 58:45.000
What do you mean? Why?

58:45.083 --> 58:48.041
Should I take them?
Bring them to your house?

58:48.125 --> 58:49.916
-You're at the studio?
-<i>Yes.</i>

58:51.541 --> 58:54.125
They asked you to clean out
my dressing room?

58:55.583 --> 58:57.041
They suggested.

58:57.125 --> 58:59.083
<i>Sons of bitches.</i>

58:59.166 --> 59:00.916
I had that room for years.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.083
My second home, I can't believe it.

59:03.166 --> 59:04.250
I'll--

59:05.750 --> 59:07.625
Sorry, Maxi. I have to go,

59:07.708 --> 59:09.125
my daughter's calling.

59:09.208 --> 59:12.958
No, wait. Send me the address
and I'll send you the drops.

59:13.041 --> 59:14.625
Okay, I will.

59:15.166 --> 59:16.000
Carla.

59:16.083 --> 59:18.333
Hey, can you come to the hospital?

59:19.000 --> 59:19.958
What?

59:20.041 --> 59:23.500
I have a patient who's a fan of yours
and wants to meet you.

59:23.583 --> 59:25.250
Okay, sure.

59:25.333 --> 59:27.125
I'll be there soon.

59:27.208 --> 59:28.500
Thanks.

59:28.583 --> 59:29.750
Bye, see you soon.

59:32.958 --> 59:35.541
He wants to say hi, take a photo.

59:35.625 --> 59:37.625
-How old is the kid?
-Eight.

59:37.708 --> 59:39.375
-Hi.
-Hi, how are you?

59:39.458 --> 59:43.250
You couldn't disguise yourself a little?
A hat, glasses, something?

59:43.333 --> 59:46.041
-I don't know. What's wrong with the kid?
-Doesn't matter.

59:46.125 --> 59:47.708
-Don't ask.
-You legend.

59:47.791 --> 59:51.125
Don't ask him what's wrong.
Say hi, take a photo, that's it.

59:51.208 --> 59:54.416
-But I want to know what--
-It doesn't matter.

59:54.500 --> 59:56.500
Don't talk too much, Dad.

59:56.583 --> 59:59.458
Don't do that exaggerated optimist act.

1:00:01.666 --> 1:00:02.625
Okay.

1:00:03.541 --> 1:00:06.291
-Wait, what's his name?
-Rodrigo.

1:00:06.375 --> 1:00:07.541
Hey, Rodrigo.

1:00:07.625 --> 1:00:09.375
Mom, Miguel!

1:00:09.458 --> 1:00:11.791
-It can't be.
-Hi, ma'am. Nice to meet you.

1:00:11.875 --> 1:00:13.125
How are you, Rodrigo?

1:00:13.208 --> 1:00:16.041
My daughter said
you watch me every night on TV

1:00:16.125 --> 1:00:17.041
and you're a fan.

1:00:17.125 --> 1:00:18.791
-Daughter?
-He's your dad.

1:00:20.500 --> 1:00:22.625
You weren't on last night. Were you fired?

1:00:22.708 --> 1:00:25.541
No, I took a few days to rest, that's all.

1:00:25.625 --> 1:00:27.208
And to visit your daughter.

1:00:27.291 --> 1:00:29.833
-Yes.
-Would you take a photo with Rodrigo?

1:00:29.916 --> 1:00:31.666
Of course, no problem.

1:00:31.750 --> 1:00:36.083
A little birdie told me someone here
knows a lot about meteorology.

1:00:36.166 --> 1:00:39.708
Rodrigo, what's the weather
going to be like tomorrow?

1:00:39.791 --> 1:00:41.833
Between 15 and 17 degrees,

1:00:41.916 --> 1:00:44.833
75% humidity, and isolated rains.

1:00:44.916 --> 1:00:46.916
Hired. See you on air tomorrow.

1:00:47.500 --> 1:00:48.916
Here we go.

1:00:49.541 --> 1:00:50.375
Smile.

1:00:56.041 --> 1:00:56.875
Let's go.

1:00:59.833 --> 1:01:00.958
It'll be fine.

1:01:01.750 --> 1:01:04.000
-What?
-The boy. You'll see.

1:01:04.791 --> 1:01:07.500
Don't make predictions, Dad.
You don't know.

1:01:07.583 --> 1:01:09.000
No one knows.

1:01:09.083 --> 1:01:13.083
I can't stand people who say
everything will be fine. They don't know.

1:01:13.166 --> 1:01:15.333
It's a wish, a saying.

1:01:15.416 --> 1:01:18.291
It's an irresponsible,
stupid thing to say.

1:01:18.375 --> 1:01:20.458
If things go wrong, then what?

1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:22.625
You have to be realistic.

1:01:23.375 --> 1:01:24.250
Okay.

1:01:24.750 --> 1:01:27.000
-I'm trying to be nice.
-You're not.

1:01:27.083 --> 1:01:30.000
I don't know what you think nice is,
but that's not it.

1:01:30.083 --> 1:01:30.916
It's not.

1:01:39.416 --> 1:01:41.166
I'm staying a bit longer, Carla.

1:01:41.250 --> 1:01:42.958
-What?
-Yes, I've decided.

1:01:43.750 --> 1:01:46.125
-And your job in Buenos Aires?
-No, that's--

1:01:46.208 --> 1:01:49.375
I know nobody wants to watch you now,

1:01:49.458 --> 1:01:50.458
but that will pass.

1:01:50.541 --> 1:01:53.666
They need someone to predict the weather
in Córdoba too.

1:01:53.750 --> 1:01:56.125
We already have weather people in Córdoba.

1:01:56.208 --> 1:01:59.125
No one as good as me. I'm sure.

1:01:59.208 --> 1:02:02.250
You got the capital of the entire country
to hate you, Dad,

1:02:02.333 --> 1:02:04.958
-don't make it the entire nation.
-Carla.

1:02:05.041 --> 1:02:06.416
Okay.

1:02:06.500 --> 1:02:08.583
Sorry, I know that was mean.

1:02:08.666 --> 1:02:10.916
-Too harsh for my taste.
-Sorry.

1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:12.500
Too mean.

1:02:12.583 --> 1:02:15.208
-And I--
-Listen.

1:02:15.708 --> 1:02:18.500
I need you to leave the house soon.

1:02:18.583 --> 1:02:20.208
What do you mean "soon"?

1:02:20.291 --> 1:02:23.750
I need you to be gone from 7:00 to 11:00.

1:02:23.833 --> 1:02:26.125
-Carla!
-Sorry, I forgot.

1:02:26.208 --> 1:02:28.416
I forgot I have friends coming over.

1:02:28.500 --> 1:02:30.208
Where do I go for four hours?

1:02:30.750 --> 1:02:33.125
I don't know, Dad. Go for a walk.

1:02:33.208 --> 1:02:36.875
-Get something to eat. It's a great city.
-So what?

1:02:36.958 --> 1:02:40.000
I can't be out in public
with the way things are,

1:02:40.083 --> 1:02:43.333
-everyone looking at me.
-I don't know, Dad.

1:02:43.416 --> 1:02:46.625
I made plans before you came. Okay?

1:02:46.708 --> 1:02:48.791
-Yep.
-I need my space, Dad.

1:02:48.875 --> 1:02:51.250
Oh, Carla. "I need my space."

1:02:52.083 --> 1:02:54.416
Okay, let's talk.

1:02:58.000 --> 1:02:58.833
Carla.

1:03:00.208 --> 1:03:01.083
Carla.

1:03:01.583 --> 1:03:02.875
Carla.

1:03:04.458 --> 1:03:05.500
Carla.

1:03:05.583 --> 1:03:07.291
You locked me in.

1:03:10.166 --> 1:03:11.166
Didn't you see me?

1:03:11.708 --> 1:03:14.750
Unbelievable. I don't even exist to you.

1:03:14.833 --> 1:03:16.875
I don't, no matter what.

1:03:16.958 --> 1:03:18.958
Damn it. Now what do I do?

1:03:30.416 --> 1:03:32.083
Sorry, I don't want to bother you.

1:03:35.666 --> 1:03:37.458
People don't get it, right?

1:03:38.958 --> 1:03:39.791
I mean, it's--

1:03:40.583 --> 1:03:42.250
What they're doing is unfair.

1:03:43.500 --> 1:03:45.000
Another one, please.

1:03:49.541 --> 1:03:50.791
No one could've predicted

1:03:52.625 --> 1:03:54.833
the hail.
But I could've predicted the storm.

1:03:56.791 --> 1:03:57.958
I didn't see it coming.

1:04:02.708 --> 1:04:04.166
Did I say something funny?

1:04:04.250 --> 1:04:05.708
No.

1:04:06.541 --> 1:04:07.500
That's Bernardo.

1:04:08.083 --> 1:04:09.208
Who's Bernardo?

1:04:10.625 --> 1:04:11.541
Bernardo,

1:04:12.041 --> 1:04:13.333
meet Miguel Flores,

1:04:13.416 --> 1:04:15.625
the most famous meteorologist
in the country.

1:04:18.125 --> 1:04:18.958
Alright.

1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:24.125
Bernardo knows a lot about weather.

1:04:24.208 --> 1:04:27.750
He doesn't speak much,
but when he talks, he's always right.

1:04:31.666 --> 1:04:33.375
Are you a meteorologist too?

1:04:39.333 --> 1:04:40.625
-The check, please.
-No.

1:04:40.708 --> 1:04:43.333
Tell me tomorrow's forecast
and we're good.

1:04:44.208 --> 1:04:45.166
I don't have it.

1:04:45.791 --> 1:04:46.916
I'm on vacation.

1:04:48.041 --> 1:04:50.958
It's on me anyway.
It's an honor to have you here.

1:04:52.041 --> 1:04:54.250
Tomorrow, 7:14. Rain.

1:04:57.666 --> 1:04:58.583
What?

1:05:00.666 --> 1:05:03.291
At 7:14 in the morning,
it's going to rain.

1:05:07.041 --> 1:05:07.875
Exactly?

1:05:12.416 --> 1:05:14.500
7:14.

1:05:19.875 --> 1:05:22.000
Okay. Thanks for the whiskey.

1:05:36.708 --> 1:05:39.041
-The spinach and cheese pie is good.
-So yummy.

1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:42.250
-Hi.
-Hi.

1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:46.166
-Hey, a guy's here. Is he your dad?
-No.

1:05:47.458 --> 1:05:49.458
Dad, you came back early.

1:05:49.541 --> 1:05:51.875
Early? You said 11:00. It's 11:45.

1:05:51.958 --> 1:05:53.541
-Already?
-Yes, already.

1:05:53.625 --> 1:05:55.041
Hi, Miguel.

1:05:55.125 --> 1:05:56.708
Hi, Mauro. How are you?

1:05:56.791 --> 1:05:59.666
-It's Marcelo.
-Sorry, I keep confusing those names.

1:05:59.750 --> 1:06:00.625
It's fine.

1:06:00.708 --> 1:06:02.625
-All's well?
-Yes.

1:06:02.708 --> 1:06:03.625
Good.

1:06:03.708 --> 1:06:06.500
Sorry. We'd have put on clothes
if we'd known you were coming.

1:06:08.041 --> 1:06:09.208
No, no problem.

1:06:09.750 --> 1:06:11.750
Well, I'm heading to bed.

1:06:11.833 --> 1:06:14.125
We have two surgeries tomorrow,
I need the rest.

1:06:14.208 --> 1:06:16.333
Of course, you have to rest.

1:06:16.875 --> 1:06:20.541
Miguel, let me say that your fish
looks delicious.

1:06:20.625 --> 1:06:22.958
Well, thanks, but he's not for eating.

1:06:23.041 --> 1:06:24.291
Of course, right.

1:06:24.375 --> 1:06:26.708
But he likes to eat.

1:06:26.791 --> 1:06:28.208
He loved the quiche.

1:06:28.291 --> 1:06:30.208
What? Osvaldo can't eat that.

1:06:30.291 --> 1:06:33.416
-What do you mean? He loved it.
-What? I--

1:06:33.500 --> 1:06:35.708
There's a guy in the bathroom.

1:06:35.791 --> 1:06:37.750
-How many are there?
-Go to your room.

1:06:37.833 --> 1:06:39.875
-They're leaving.
-But--

1:06:41.083 --> 1:06:42.333
But the guy came out--

1:06:44.541 --> 1:06:45.750
Coming through.

1:07:05.708 --> 1:07:06.875
They're gone, Dad.

1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:12.041
In case you need to use the bathroom
or the kitchen.

1:07:23.416 --> 1:07:25.916
Didn't you say you stopped seeing Marcelo?

1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:28.458
-Yes.
-So why was he walking around naked?

1:07:28.541 --> 1:07:31.458
He wasn't naked, and we're friends.

1:07:31.541 --> 1:07:34.625
Oh, friends. And the other two,
were they friends?

1:07:34.708 --> 1:07:35.708
Yes, they are.

1:07:35.791 --> 1:07:38.583
We're all friends who sometimes like to

1:07:39.083 --> 1:07:39.916
be together.

1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:41.041
Okay.

1:07:41.125 --> 1:07:43.541
Well, you don't owe me an explanation.

1:07:43.625 --> 1:07:45.041
It seems like I do.

1:07:45.125 --> 1:07:48.625
It's just strange to me that you like
to be with your friends.

1:07:49.125 --> 1:07:50.083
Okay.

1:07:50.166 --> 1:07:53.458
So, tell me, Dad,
what did you think I liked?

1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:55.416
I don't know…

1:07:55.500 --> 1:07:56.958
You know nothing about me.

1:07:57.041 --> 1:07:59.041
-That's not true.
-It is.

1:07:59.125 --> 1:08:02.541
You know nothing about me
and I don't know anything about you.

1:08:03.125 --> 1:08:04.000
I mean.

1:08:04.083 --> 1:08:06.958
Tell me, who are you dating right now?

1:08:07.041 --> 1:08:09.166
What kind of question is that?

1:08:09.250 --> 1:08:13.250
I don't know who you've dated
since Mom died.

1:08:16.833 --> 1:08:18.250
No one important.

1:08:21.083 --> 1:08:22.458
So, friends.

1:08:22.541 --> 1:08:24.458
Friends with benefits.

1:08:25.166 --> 1:08:27.041
You could say so.

1:08:27.125 --> 1:08:29.333
I also have friends with benefits.

1:08:31.708 --> 1:08:32.708
Look,

1:08:33.583 --> 1:08:37.208
if you're thinking of staying
in Córdoba for a while,

1:08:37.291 --> 1:08:39.625
I think you should look for a place.

1:08:42.375 --> 1:08:43.458
Great.

1:08:43.541 --> 1:08:44.500
Seriously.

1:09:06.041 --> 1:09:07.375
I did what I could, Carla.

1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:10.750
You lost your mom, I lost my wife.

1:09:11.291 --> 1:09:13.625
I know we've been apart for a long time--

1:09:13.708 --> 1:09:17.375
Stop. It's because
of your job in Buenos Aires, right?

1:09:17.458 --> 1:09:18.958
It's very far away.

1:09:19.041 --> 1:09:22.250
"It's not that I don't want to see you,
blah, blah, blah."

1:09:22.791 --> 1:09:26.625
"I have so much work,
I don't have time, blah, blah, blah."

1:09:27.958 --> 1:09:29.916
"Life is tough there."

1:09:30.833 --> 1:09:33.333
You don't need to justify it, Dad. Really.

1:09:33.875 --> 1:09:35.041
I'm not complaining.

1:09:35.125 --> 1:09:36.375
That's not true.

1:09:36.458 --> 1:09:39.500
The things you're saying,
your distance suggest otherwise.

1:09:39.583 --> 1:09:40.666
Distance?

1:09:40.750 --> 1:09:43.375
That distance's been there a long time,
and I didn't put it there.

1:09:43.458 --> 1:09:45.041
It's the only thing that's worked.

1:09:46.333 --> 1:09:48.000
What? Being distant?

1:09:48.083 --> 1:09:50.750
In dealing with the death of your mother.

1:09:52.375 --> 1:09:54.375
Not a day goes by that I don't think

1:09:54.458 --> 1:09:57.375
about that lightning bolt
and how random her death was.

1:09:57.458 --> 1:09:59.208
I had to make sense of it.

1:09:59.291 --> 1:10:02.000
I couldn't accept
that she just died like that.

1:10:02.083 --> 1:10:04.458
-It's Mom's fault, then.
-No.

1:10:04.541 --> 1:10:05.791
It's my fault.

1:10:07.750 --> 1:10:10.583
Since that storm,
I couldn't stop asking myself why.

1:10:10.666 --> 1:10:11.708
Why didn't I see it?

1:10:11.791 --> 1:10:13.333
Why didn't I see it coming?

1:10:13.416 --> 1:10:16.208
I threw myself into data, numbers, maps,

1:10:16.708 --> 1:10:20.500
forecast accuracy, and slowly I became

1:10:20.583 --> 1:10:21.666
obsessed.

1:10:21.750 --> 1:10:25.208
Yes. That obsession brought you success,
and that success

1:10:26.375 --> 1:10:27.875
brought you to Buenos Aires.

1:10:27.958 --> 1:10:29.333
Until I failed again.

1:10:29.833 --> 1:10:32.875
Right, then you remembered
you have a daughter in Córdoba.

1:10:32.958 --> 1:10:34.416
No, it's not like that.

1:10:35.041 --> 1:10:37.416
It's not like that,
you weren't a little girl.

1:10:37.916 --> 1:10:40.000
You weren't alone, you had Grandma.

1:10:40.083 --> 1:10:41.916
I told you many times, "Come live here."

1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:45.166
"No, I'll stay with Grandma."
You were always independent.

1:10:45.250 --> 1:10:47.333
You never wanted my opinion.

1:10:47.416 --> 1:10:49.541
Never. And you still don't, do you?

1:10:50.583 --> 1:10:51.625
So,

1:10:51.708 --> 1:10:53.750
time flew by,

1:10:53.833 --> 1:10:56.958
and I didn't notice
the distance growing between us.

1:10:58.291 --> 1:11:00.750
Or I chose not to notice. I don't know.

1:11:02.958 --> 1:11:04.583
Is this an apology?

1:11:05.250 --> 1:11:06.375
Maybe, I don't know.

1:11:07.041 --> 1:11:09.458
-Do you think I did it on purpose?
-I don't know.

1:11:10.708 --> 1:11:13.833
You're my daughter,
the most important thing in my life.

1:11:15.458 --> 1:11:19.625
Maybe I'm not the dad you hoped for, but…

1:11:21.583 --> 1:11:23.041
Dad, I needed you.

1:11:23.833 --> 1:11:26.000
I needed you so many times.

1:11:28.375 --> 1:11:30.250
Until a day came that I didn't.

1:11:31.166 --> 1:11:33.125
I didn't need you anymore.

1:11:37.791 --> 1:11:39.333
Well, I need you now.

1:11:45.708 --> 1:11:46.541
Okay.

1:11:48.125 --> 1:11:49.500
Okay. Okay.

1:11:50.291 --> 1:11:51.375
How about this,

1:11:52.416 --> 1:11:54.541
I don't know, let's start

1:11:55.541 --> 1:11:57.708
by being the father and daughter
that we can be.

1:11:58.250 --> 1:12:00.000
Okay, that works.

1:12:00.083 --> 1:12:01.291
-Whatever you say.
-Okay.

1:12:01.375 --> 1:12:03.416
-Let's not force it.
-Okay.

1:12:03.500 --> 1:12:04.750
Okay? Please?

1:12:04.833 --> 1:12:09.625
No, we'll do what we can. Good.

1:12:10.333 --> 1:12:11.416
Goodnight, Dad.

1:12:12.666 --> 1:12:13.500
Goodnight.

1:12:15.833 --> 1:12:16.666
Sleep tight.

1:12:16.750 --> 1:12:17.750
You too.

1:12:37.625 --> 1:12:39.208
How are you, Osvaldito?

1:12:40.541 --> 1:12:42.250
Things are hard.

1:12:42.750 --> 1:12:43.583
Yeah.

1:12:45.916 --> 1:12:47.541
Your sister is like you.

1:12:47.625 --> 1:12:50.333
It's hard for her.

1:12:52.500 --> 1:12:53.416
Okay then.

1:12:54.333 --> 1:12:56.750
Get some rest, it's night night time.

1:12:56.833 --> 1:12:57.708
See you tomorrow.

1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:13.125
Morning.

1:13:13.208 --> 1:13:14.250
Morning.

1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:16.833
I made coffee and toast.

1:13:17.541 --> 1:13:19.333
No, thanks. I'm late.

1:13:19.875 --> 1:13:20.750
Okay.

1:13:20.833 --> 1:13:21.708
What's this?

1:13:22.833 --> 1:13:25.458
Some homeopathic drops
my assistant sent me.

1:13:25.541 --> 1:13:26.625
Homeo--

1:13:27.458 --> 1:13:30.875
Your daughter is a doctor
and you're taking this stuff?

1:13:30.958 --> 1:13:32.125
For anxiety.

1:13:32.208 --> 1:13:35.000
But I also take regular pills
for my triglycerides.

1:13:35.083 --> 1:13:36.708
They were high.

1:13:37.541 --> 1:13:39.208
-I leveled them out.
-Listen, Dad,

1:13:40.916 --> 1:13:43.583
tonight I'm having dinner at the hospital.

1:13:43.666 --> 1:13:47.125
Once a week I have dinner there
with the kids and their parents.

1:13:47.208 --> 1:13:48.666
Okay, I'll stay here.

1:13:49.166 --> 1:13:50.000
No.

1:13:50.958 --> 1:13:52.458
Do you want to come?

1:13:53.125 --> 1:13:54.500
Yeah, of course.

1:13:55.750 --> 1:13:57.250
Of course, I'd love to.

1:13:57.333 --> 1:13:58.875
Or if you had other plans?

1:13:58.958 --> 1:14:00.458
No, nothing.

1:14:00.541 --> 1:14:01.583
Okay.

1:14:02.083 --> 1:14:04.541
Tell me when. I'd love to.

1:14:05.875 --> 1:14:07.750
You know what? I'll have some coffee.

1:14:07.833 --> 1:14:10.375
-Of course.
-Yeah.

1:14:10.458 --> 1:14:11.916
Start your morning.

1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:13.916
Yeah. If I'm a little late, it's fine.

1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:15.500
Yeah, who cares?

1:14:15.583 --> 1:14:17.541
They won't say anything.

1:14:17.625 --> 1:14:18.541
Nothing.

1:14:45.625 --> 1:14:48.750
Son of a bitch.

1:15:04.666 --> 1:15:06.750
Excuse me? Hi. Can I ask you something?

1:15:06.833 --> 1:15:08.416
Flores, it's you.

1:15:08.500 --> 1:15:09.333
Hi.

1:15:09.416 --> 1:15:11.958
My mom won't believe this.

1:15:12.041 --> 1:15:13.958
-She loves you.
-Not now, please.

1:15:14.041 --> 1:15:15.125
Excuse me?

1:15:15.208 --> 1:15:17.666
We're closed. We open at noon.

1:15:17.750 --> 1:15:18.916
Just one thing.

1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:21.541
There was a guy here last night
with a poncho.

1:15:21.625 --> 1:15:22.875
-I need--
-Look.

1:15:22.958 --> 1:15:25.958
-One second.
-I'm busy, please.

1:15:26.041 --> 1:15:28.375
-What, you acting like a big shot?
-Not at all.

1:15:28.458 --> 1:15:31.000
Buenos Aires kicked you out, Flores.

1:15:31.083 --> 1:15:32.208
My God.

1:15:32.833 --> 1:15:33.750
Thank you.

1:15:33.833 --> 1:15:36.750
Hurry, I have to finish up.

1:15:36.833 --> 1:15:39.208
There was a man sitting at that table.

1:15:39.833 --> 1:15:42.625
He had a poncho, he was drinking brandy,

1:15:42.708 --> 1:15:44.291
he looked very rustic.

1:15:44.375 --> 1:15:45.208
Bernardo?

1:15:46.083 --> 1:15:48.666
Maybe. Do you know where he lives?

1:15:49.333 --> 1:15:51.333
Yeah, he lives that way,

1:15:51.416 --> 1:15:52.791
by the mountains.

1:15:52.875 --> 1:15:55.083
Where exactly by the mountains, what area?

1:15:55.166 --> 1:15:59.875
-It's not easy to get there.
-Don't worry, just tell me where.

1:16:46.625 --> 1:16:48.958
I'll be just a few minutes, okay?
Wait for me.

1:17:37.291 --> 1:17:39.125
Oh, sorry. Good morning.

1:17:39.791 --> 1:17:42.041
I clapped because I didn't see a doorbell.

1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:44.125
There's no bell.

1:17:45.250 --> 1:17:46.708
There's no electricity here.

1:17:48.666 --> 1:17:50.833
But you could've knocked like this.

1:17:53.166 --> 1:17:55.125
-Simple.
-Yeah, that's true.

1:17:57.833 --> 1:17:58.958
What are you here for?

1:17:59.666 --> 1:18:00.916
An answer, that's it.

1:18:02.833 --> 1:18:06.458
How did you know it would rain
at 7:14 on the dot?

1:18:22.250 --> 1:18:23.125
Should I wait?

1:18:28.291 --> 1:18:30.625
Are you coming back or should I go?

1:18:30.708 --> 1:18:32.416
Come in, damn it.

1:18:33.666 --> 1:18:34.500
Yes, sir.

1:18:35.208 --> 1:18:36.166
Coming in.

1:18:37.250 --> 1:18:38.083
Come in.

1:18:39.416 --> 1:18:41.041
What a nice house.

1:18:42.916 --> 1:18:44.416
-Here?
-Yes.

1:18:44.500 --> 1:18:46.000
I'll take a seat here.

1:18:51.916 --> 1:18:53.000
Thank you.

1:18:53.958 --> 1:18:56.333
My mother ate
boiled corn on the cob every day.

1:18:58.458 --> 1:19:01.791
She looked at the bubbles in the water
and knew if it would rain.

1:19:03.958 --> 1:19:05.125
Wow.

1:19:07.708 --> 1:19:10.000
Did you inherit your mom's gift?

1:19:10.541 --> 1:19:12.625
You can see it in the bubbles?

1:19:12.708 --> 1:19:14.166
I don't like corn on the cob.

1:19:18.708 --> 1:19:21.208
So how do you know
when it's going to rain?

1:19:22.500 --> 1:19:24.208
I'd love you to teach me.

1:19:24.291 --> 1:19:25.708
Look, I can pay you.

1:19:25.791 --> 1:19:30.000
I can get you electricity
and a satellite to watch TV.

1:19:31.041 --> 1:19:32.166
I don't need anything.

1:19:32.250 --> 1:19:33.125
Well, but,

1:19:34.166 --> 1:19:36.375
how do you live without electricity?

1:19:36.958 --> 1:19:39.500
Do you have a flashlight? Candles?

1:19:39.583 --> 1:19:40.708
No, nothing.

1:19:43.125 --> 1:19:44.416
You can't live in the dark.

1:19:44.500 --> 1:19:46.916
I sleep at night
and have the sun during the day.

1:19:49.500 --> 1:19:50.333
Right.

1:19:51.625 --> 1:19:52.458
No,

1:19:52.958 --> 1:19:55.125
I was fantasizing, thinking,

1:19:55.875 --> 1:19:57.250
"Hey,

1:19:57.333 --> 1:19:58.666
maybe we could unite

1:20:00.166 --> 1:20:01.416
our talents."

1:20:02.166 --> 1:20:04.083
What I'm going to say sounds crazy.

1:20:04.166 --> 1:20:08.125
I thought we could have a show here.

1:20:08.833 --> 1:20:09.833
You'd do

1:20:10.500 --> 1:20:12.666
the forecast, I'd host.

1:20:12.750 --> 1:20:16.166
You must be from Buenos Aires,
always wanting more.

1:20:16.250 --> 1:20:18.375
I'm not. I'm from Río Cuarto.

1:20:19.041 --> 1:20:21.791
My dad delivered seltzer water,
my mom was a seamstress.

1:20:22.500 --> 1:20:25.000
I busted my ass to get where I am.

1:20:25.791 --> 1:20:26.708
And where are you?

1:20:29.166 --> 1:20:30.375
Why do you do this?

1:20:31.166 --> 1:20:32.708
Are you interested in weather?

1:20:33.208 --> 1:20:34.416
Or do you like fame?

1:20:34.500 --> 1:20:35.708
It's much more

1:20:36.375 --> 1:20:37.500
complicated than that.

1:20:38.833 --> 1:20:40.000
When I was young,

1:20:40.541 --> 1:20:43.166
my dad had ten vacation days.

1:20:43.708 --> 1:20:46.791
And every summer
he brought us to Mar de las Pampas

1:20:46.875 --> 1:20:48.750
when it was practically uninhabited.

1:20:50.208 --> 1:20:51.416
And there were summers

1:20:52.583 --> 1:20:54.958
where we had ten days of rain.

1:20:57.875 --> 1:21:01.083
And I saw how it upset my dad

1:21:02.416 --> 1:21:04.625
to the point of depression,

1:21:04.708 --> 1:21:06.541
and it would ruin our vacation.

1:21:06.625 --> 1:21:10.583
So, as a child, I always dreamed
of controlling the weather.

1:21:12.250 --> 1:21:14.541
To see my dad happy, just for a bit.

1:21:15.875 --> 1:21:17.875
Nobody can control the weather.

1:21:17.958 --> 1:21:18.958
Nobody.

1:21:21.333 --> 1:21:22.375
I know.

1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:25.500
But forecasting

1:21:26.583 --> 1:21:29.000
is the closest you can get, right?

1:21:51.125 --> 1:21:52.125
Should I wait?

1:21:57.625 --> 1:21:59.125
Are you coming back, Bernardo?

1:22:00.291 --> 1:22:01.375
Come, damn it!

1:22:07.250 --> 1:22:09.916
You're never there when I need you.

1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:12.083
No more. I bought everything.

1:22:12.166 --> 1:22:14.375
I only asked you to go to Once

1:22:14.458 --> 1:22:17.375
and look for a "90" numbered candle
for Dad's birthday and you say no.

1:22:17.458 --> 1:22:19.208
-Can I talk?
-<i>Fine, talk.</i>

1:22:19.291 --> 1:22:21.041
I have to do something, Marisa.

1:22:21.125 --> 1:22:23.458
How mysterious. Like what?

1:22:23.541 --> 1:22:25.416
Something. I can't say.

1:22:25.500 --> 1:22:28.375
I just have something I need to do.

1:22:28.458 --> 1:22:29.625
Okay.

1:22:30.333 --> 1:22:33.000
-When will you be back?
-Not today or tomorrow.

1:22:33.083 --> 1:22:34.541
Maybe the day after.

1:22:34.625 --> 1:22:35.458
What?

1:22:35.958 --> 1:22:38.833
You're just coming back whenever?

1:22:38.916 --> 1:22:41.000
Are you seeing a hooker? You are.

1:22:41.083 --> 1:22:42.791
What? A hooker? Marisa.

1:22:42.875 --> 1:22:45.166
Why do you overthink things?

1:22:45.250 --> 1:22:47.833
What money do I have for a hooker? Okay?

1:22:47.916 --> 1:22:50.250
Sorry. Let's calm down.

1:22:50.333 --> 1:22:54.666
-I'll be home in a couple days--
-In a couple days?

1:22:54.750 --> 1:22:57.000
Why the fuck did I go to yoga today?

1:22:57.666 --> 1:22:59.000
Marisa, don't!

1:23:00.458 --> 1:23:01.291
Stupid.

1:23:59.000 --> 1:23:59.916
Argentina.

1:24:05.458 --> 1:24:08.041
Where we're standing is Argentina.

1:24:11.416 --> 1:24:12.708
No, man,

1:24:12.791 --> 1:24:14.166
the dirt is Argentina.

1:24:15.375 --> 1:24:16.708
The weeds are Chile.

1:24:17.250 --> 1:24:18.916
The weeds there are Paraguay.

1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:20.208
Those weeds are Uruguay.

1:24:22.750 --> 1:24:24.708
So it's like a map?

1:24:25.750 --> 1:24:26.958
Yes, a map.

1:24:27.833 --> 1:24:29.375
The rock is La Pampa,

1:24:29.458 --> 1:24:30.916
the anthill is Salta,

1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:32.583
this rock is Neuquén.

1:24:32.666 --> 1:24:34.208
Back there is Santa Cruz.

1:24:37.958 --> 1:24:41.250
-Do you want to go to Buenos Aires?
-Yeah, sure.

1:24:41.958 --> 1:24:42.791
Come.

1:24:47.833 --> 1:24:48.791
Buenos Aires.

1:24:58.791 --> 1:24:59.625
What's that?

1:25:00.750 --> 1:25:02.333
Professor Neurus.

1:25:04.916 --> 1:25:05.791
Look at his hair.

1:25:07.791 --> 1:25:09.750
What color was Professor Neurus' hair?

1:25:09.833 --> 1:25:11.083
Purple?

1:25:11.166 --> 1:25:12.000
No.

1:25:13.458 --> 1:25:14.291
Grey.

1:25:14.958 --> 1:25:16.416
Was this one a knockoff?

1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:19.833
No.

1:25:21.458 --> 1:25:24.375
When I was a kid,
I ate chocolate bars that came with toys.

1:25:25.625 --> 1:25:28.750
One day, the figurines
started changing colors.

1:25:29.708 --> 1:25:31.500
They lose their color.

1:25:31.583 --> 1:25:33.000
Cheap paint.

1:25:33.083 --> 1:25:34.166
No.

1:25:34.250 --> 1:25:35.750
They speak to me.

1:25:35.833 --> 1:25:37.875
You know how?

1:25:37.958 --> 1:25:40.166
By changing their hair color.

1:25:42.750 --> 1:25:44.041
And what do they say?

1:25:47.750 --> 1:25:51.041
Hail the size of soccer balls is coming.

1:25:53.125 --> 1:25:55.625
Not here. Where are we standing?

1:25:57.000 --> 1:25:57.916
Buenos Aires.

1:25:58.833 --> 1:25:59.916
Yes, Buenos Aires.

1:26:05.708 --> 1:26:07.333
A huge storm.

1:26:08.916 --> 1:26:11.041
But, today?

1:26:12.750 --> 1:26:13.625
Tonight.

1:26:21.833 --> 1:26:23.375
At 11:07.

1:26:25.333 --> 1:26:27.000
Bernardo, are you sure?

1:26:27.083 --> 1:26:29.208
Why the hell did you come if you doubt me?

1:26:29.291 --> 1:26:30.125
Sorry.

1:26:30.791 --> 1:26:32.375
Go warn the people.

1:26:36.083 --> 1:26:38.791
Nobody will believe me in Buenos Aires.

1:26:40.250 --> 1:26:42.125
Do you know how few followers I have left?

1:26:42.666 --> 1:26:45.083
If you really care about the weather

1:26:45.166 --> 1:26:47.250
and not fame, like you said,

1:26:47.333 --> 1:26:49.375
go to Buenos Aires
and do what you have to do.

1:26:49.458 --> 1:26:50.541
Do it.

1:26:51.083 --> 1:26:52.541
For the people,

1:26:53.208 --> 1:26:54.416
not for you.

1:26:54.500 --> 1:26:56.166
For the people.

1:26:57.625 --> 1:26:59.333
Don't tell anyone I told you.

1:26:59.416 --> 1:27:02.583
I don't want money,
I don't want fame, I don't want shit.

1:27:03.125 --> 1:27:04.375
Go and warn them, man.

1:27:09.458 --> 1:27:12.625
CÓRDOBA HOSPITAL

1:27:17.208 --> 1:27:18.916
CÓRDOBA HOSPITAL
PEDIATRICS

1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:21.625
DR. CARLA FLORES

1:27:26.500 --> 1:27:27.375
Bye.

1:28:14.541 --> 1:28:15.375
<i>Dad?</i>

1:28:15.916 --> 1:28:16.916
I'm in here.

1:28:18.708 --> 1:28:19.750
What are you doing?

1:28:19.833 --> 1:28:22.416
I have to go to the capital.
Take care of Osvaldo.

1:28:22.500 --> 1:28:23.916
What happened?

1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:26.041
A terrible storm is coming

1:28:26.125 --> 1:28:28.125
in Buenos Aires, I have to warn them.

1:28:28.208 --> 1:28:31.458
-Warn who?
-What do you mean? Everyone.

1:28:31.541 --> 1:28:32.625
Use a phone.

1:28:32.708 --> 1:28:34.625
I tried three times. No answer.

1:28:34.708 --> 1:28:36.875
Do you think they'll listen to you?

1:28:36.958 --> 1:28:39.208
I have a better chance, yes.

1:28:39.958 --> 1:28:41.833
-Are you drinking?
-What?

1:28:41.916 --> 1:28:43.333
No, just a <i>mate </i>with brandy.

1:28:44.333 --> 1:28:47.916
-When's the storm coming?
-Tonight, 11:07.

1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:48.833
11:07?

1:28:48.916 --> 1:28:50.708
-On the dot.
-On the dot?

1:28:50.791 --> 1:28:52.625
-11:07 exactly.
-How do you know?

1:28:52.708 --> 1:28:54.541
A hermit told me.

1:28:54.625 --> 1:28:57.333
A guy who lives in the mountains,

1:28:57.416 --> 1:29:00.500
in the middle of nowhere.

1:29:00.583 --> 1:29:03.208
A strange man.
He gets information from figurines.

1:29:03.875 --> 1:29:07.125
-Dad, how much did you drink?
-Nothing, please.

1:29:08.083 --> 1:29:09.208
-Let's look.
-What?

1:29:09.291 --> 1:29:10.458
Let's look.

1:29:11.333 --> 1:29:12.166
-Look.
-What?

1:29:12.250 --> 1:29:15.125
Tonight, clear skies.

1:29:15.208 --> 1:29:17.166
They don't know, for the love of God.

1:29:17.250 --> 1:29:18.625
You'll be wrong again.

1:29:18.708 --> 1:29:21.166
Not this time. Last night he told me,

1:29:21.250 --> 1:29:24.125
"Tomorrow at 7:14 a.m.
it's going to rain."

1:29:24.208 --> 1:29:25.583
I said, "No, no way."

1:29:25.666 --> 1:29:29.291
I was right here
and at 7:14 on the dot, it rained.

1:29:29.375 --> 1:29:30.791
I said, "Oh my God."

1:29:30.875 --> 1:29:33.708
-The hermit said this?
-Yes, exactly.

1:29:33.791 --> 1:29:37.625
So you're leaving.
You're not coming to the hospital dinner.

1:29:38.958 --> 1:29:40.958
I have no choice. I'm sorry.

1:29:41.041 --> 1:29:43.416
Rodrigo's lab results came back good.

1:29:43.500 --> 1:29:45.000
Yes! I told you.

1:29:45.083 --> 1:29:47.291
I told you. Thank God.

1:29:47.375 --> 1:29:49.833
I'm glad he's okay.

1:29:49.916 --> 1:29:50.750
Okay.

1:29:50.833 --> 1:29:51.958
Wait a minute.

1:29:52.041 --> 1:29:54.583
-Dad, calm down.
-What?

1:29:54.666 --> 1:29:56.208
Stop for a minute.

1:29:56.291 --> 1:29:57.791
What is it?

1:29:59.125 --> 1:30:00.250
What are you doing?

1:30:00.333 --> 1:30:02.458
Why are you going back, really?

1:30:02.541 --> 1:30:05.708
-I told you--
-No. Are you trying to fix your image?

1:30:06.333 --> 1:30:07.916
Do you realize the people

1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:10.458
who watch you every day
don't care about you?

1:30:11.208 --> 1:30:13.708
You can't care about someone
you don't know.

1:30:13.791 --> 1:30:14.958
They've shown you that.

1:30:15.791 --> 1:30:19.375
But maybe this time I'm not doing it
so they'll like me.

1:30:19.458 --> 1:30:22.000
Isn't there another possibility, Carla?

1:30:24.666 --> 1:30:25.500
I'm going.

1:30:26.250 --> 1:30:27.291
I have to go.

1:30:27.375 --> 1:30:29.208
I'll call you when I land.

1:30:29.291 --> 1:30:31.625
Bye, Osvaldito. Be back in a few days.

1:30:32.541 --> 1:30:34.125
He's upset.

1:30:37.750 --> 1:30:38.875
Hi.

1:30:39.458 --> 1:30:40.583
The Infallible.

1:30:44.291 --> 1:30:46.541
Poor guy. Is this a neighbor of yours?

1:30:46.625 --> 1:30:48.250
-No.
-Hey, it'll be okay, man.

1:30:48.333 --> 1:30:49.958
I watched you every night.

1:30:50.750 --> 1:30:51.875
Great.

1:30:51.958 --> 1:30:54.000
-You understand me, right?
-Sure.

1:30:54.541 --> 1:30:56.083
What are you doing?

1:30:56.166 --> 1:30:57.625
Hey, stop.

1:30:57.708 --> 1:30:59.208
I have to kill you.

1:30:59.291 --> 1:31:01.041
-What is this?
-Who are you?

1:31:01.125 --> 1:31:03.916
-I'm an idiot.
-Stop, please!

1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:05.583
Put that down, whoever you are.

1:31:05.666 --> 1:31:07.791
-Luis Contreras.
-Okay, calm down.

1:31:07.875 --> 1:31:12.833
You don't even know my name.
I've watched you every night from day one.

1:31:12.916 --> 1:31:15.458
I'd rush home to see you on the news.

1:31:15.541 --> 1:31:17.041
-Calm down.
-Get out.

1:31:17.125 --> 1:31:18.750
Not until I get what I'm owed.

1:31:18.833 --> 1:31:21.791
I don't owe you anything.
What are you saying?

1:31:21.875 --> 1:31:23.500
-Come here.
-Stop, dude.

1:31:23.583 --> 1:31:26.250
-What's wrong with you?
-I want you to see this.

1:31:26.333 --> 1:31:27.333
-What?
-Look.

1:31:29.666 --> 1:31:32.250
Yes, your car is fucked up. It's okay.

1:31:32.333 --> 1:31:34.375
No, it's not fucked up.

1:31:34.458 --> 1:31:37.666
You fucked it up with your fucking hail.

1:31:37.750 --> 1:31:41.416
Stop, it's not my hail,
it wasn't my fault.

1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:43.416
You guaranteed it.

1:31:43.500 --> 1:31:47.333
-Oh my God, that phrase.
-You guaranteed it and I believed you.

1:31:47.416 --> 1:31:50.416
In 20 years, you were never wrong.

1:31:50.500 --> 1:31:52.125
Why were you wrong now?

1:31:54.125 --> 1:31:56.375
Did you want to wreck my car? Is that it?

1:31:56.458 --> 1:31:58.583
Do you hear how ridiculous you sound?

1:31:59.375 --> 1:32:03.708
Please, Luis. I was wrong,
and I'm paying for it. Look where I am.

1:32:03.791 --> 1:32:06.000
-I'm hiding so they don't lynch me.
-Dad.

1:32:06.083 --> 1:32:07.083
Okay, sorry.

1:32:07.166 --> 1:32:08.375
Look where I am.

1:32:09.208 --> 1:32:10.750
Look where I am.

1:32:10.833 --> 1:32:14.125
I drove 500 miles to kick your ass.

1:32:14.208 --> 1:32:15.750
-Calm down.
-I can't go home,

1:32:15.833 --> 1:32:19.000
I can't go back to work
without being called an idiot.

1:32:19.083 --> 1:32:21.833
"Listen to Miguel,"

1:32:21.916 --> 1:32:24.333
I spent years telling them.

1:32:24.416 --> 1:32:26.666
Do you know how much they made fun of me?

1:32:26.750 --> 1:32:29.333
"Stop talking about fucking Flores."

1:32:29.416 --> 1:32:31.083
And I defended you

1:32:32.500 --> 1:32:33.666
like a brother.

1:32:35.166 --> 1:32:37.916
I believed you. I had blind faith.

1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:40.166
Your word was gold to me.

1:32:40.250 --> 1:32:41.416
Well, you were wrong.

1:32:41.500 --> 1:32:43.041
No, he believed me.

1:32:43.125 --> 1:32:45.541
I understand. I was wrong.

1:32:45.625 --> 1:32:48.500
I also blindly trust myself, Luis.

1:32:48.583 --> 1:32:51.583
But I had nothing to do
with what happened.

1:32:53.625 --> 1:32:55.833
Calm down. Enough.

1:32:55.916 --> 1:32:58.500
-Put the extinguisher down.
-Listen to me.

1:32:59.125 --> 1:33:00.791
Listen, I'll put this down.

1:33:00.875 --> 1:33:02.583
Just one second.

1:33:02.666 --> 1:33:05.000
Tonight there's going to be
one of the worst storms

1:33:05.083 --> 1:33:07.000
in the history of Buenos Aires.

1:33:07.083 --> 1:33:08.458
Horrible.

1:33:08.541 --> 1:33:10.416
You still have time, go home.

1:33:11.291 --> 1:33:14.666
Warn your friends and family
so you can save them.

1:33:14.750 --> 1:33:18.500
Do you want me to look like an idiot?
To get kicked out of my house?

1:33:18.583 --> 1:33:21.000
That won't happen, they'll respect you.

1:33:21.875 --> 1:33:24.000
Trust what I'm saying. I'm not wrong.

1:33:24.083 --> 1:33:27.166
11:07. It's going to be a disaster.

1:33:27.250 --> 1:33:30.000
Go. I'm going home too,
to fix the damage I caused.

1:33:30.083 --> 1:33:31.916
-When?
-Now. Look at my suitcase.

1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:35.625
I was headed to the airport,
my flight leaves at 5:00 p.m.

1:33:35.708 --> 1:33:38.166
Go, you have time. 11:07. Go.

1:33:38.250 --> 1:33:42.500
11:07. When you say,
"One of the worst storms," you mean--

1:33:43.041 --> 1:33:43.875
Hail again?

1:33:43.958 --> 1:33:45.083
Worse.

1:33:45.166 --> 1:33:47.291
Hail the size of soccer balls.

1:33:47.375 --> 1:33:49.416
Listen to me. Go.

1:33:50.208 --> 1:33:52.250
Let's do this.

1:33:52.333 --> 1:33:54.083
Let me get my wallet.

1:33:55.458 --> 1:33:57.083
I'm giving you my personal card.

1:33:57.625 --> 1:33:58.875
Here's my phone number.

1:33:59.375 --> 1:34:01.916
You can call me.

1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:04.208
If I'm wrong, we'll meet up

1:34:04.291 --> 1:34:06.875
and you can crack my head open
with that extinguisher.

1:34:06.958 --> 1:34:09.583
I'll allow it, seriously.

1:34:09.666 --> 1:34:10.666
Take the card.

1:34:10.750 --> 1:34:12.083
Now, go home.

1:34:14.958 --> 1:34:15.833
There it is. Go.

1:34:16.458 --> 1:34:17.458
Go.

1:34:25.625 --> 1:34:27.583
Go, kid.

1:34:27.666 --> 1:34:29.833
-Everything'll be okay.
-I loved you like crazy.

1:34:31.416 --> 1:34:34.291
-I loved you like crazy.
-Go.

1:34:35.208 --> 1:34:36.875
I won't fail you. You'll see.

1:34:37.666 --> 1:34:39.250
Calm down. Go.

1:34:39.875 --> 1:34:41.500
Go, hurry.

1:34:41.583 --> 1:34:43.833
11:07, okay, Luisito?

1:34:43.916 --> 1:34:45.166
Should I leave this open?

1:34:45.250 --> 1:34:48.250
Yes, please. Thank you. Bye, Luis.

1:34:49.250 --> 1:34:52.375
No.

1:34:52.458 --> 1:34:54.791
That guy is insane.

1:34:55.416 --> 1:34:57.708
He came here from Buenos Aires.

1:34:58.250 --> 1:35:00.750
Poor guy. I failed him.

1:35:02.208 --> 1:35:04.291
-I'm going, Carla.
-Okay.

1:35:04.375 --> 1:35:06.750
-I'll take you.
-Okay.

1:35:34.916 --> 1:35:38.041
Take care of Osvaldo for me
until I get back.

1:35:38.791 --> 1:35:41.125
Sorry for missing the dinner tonight.

1:35:41.208 --> 1:35:43.166
It's okay. Another time.

1:35:43.250 --> 1:35:44.083
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:36:04.625 --> 1:36:06.083
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:36:47.625 --> 1:36:49.333
<i>Welcome to Buenos Aires.</i>

1:36:49.416 --> 1:36:54.791
<i>Please remain seated</i>
<i>with your seatbelts fastened.</i>

1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:03.333
Thank you, Maxi, for bringing me here.

1:37:03.416 --> 1:37:05.875
Go home, close your windows,
warn your family.

1:37:05.958 --> 1:37:09.500
Are you crazy?
You think I'm leaving you now?

1:37:10.166 --> 1:37:14.083
I was with you
when you were number one on TV,

1:37:14.166 --> 1:37:17.083
and I'm with you
when you're canceled, Miguel.

1:37:17.166 --> 1:37:18.708
You're very important to me.

1:37:18.791 --> 1:37:20.958
Calm down. I understand.

1:37:21.041 --> 1:37:22.583
Come with me. Let's go.

1:37:24.500 --> 1:37:25.333
Domingo.

1:37:25.833 --> 1:37:28.750
-Miguel, what are you doing here?
-I'm here to see Gustavo.

1:37:32.208 --> 1:37:33.583
Open up, Domingo.

1:37:34.750 --> 1:37:36.041
Come on, it's Miguel.

1:37:42.375 --> 1:37:43.291
Open!

1:37:45.583 --> 1:37:47.958
This moron thinks he owns the network.

1:37:51.625 --> 1:37:54.458
-Melisa, the lipstick isn't here.
-We'll get them.

1:37:54.541 --> 1:37:56.375
Go get them.

1:37:56.458 --> 1:37:58.000
Get them, please.

1:37:58.083 --> 1:38:01.583
Carmencita this, Carmencita that.

1:38:04.916 --> 1:38:05.750
Okay.

1:38:09.791 --> 1:38:13.750
I told you seven times, this isn't my job.

1:38:13.833 --> 1:38:17.708
They're looking for the wardrobe
and it's right here in the hallway.

1:38:17.791 --> 1:38:19.333
I'm bringing it now.

1:38:19.416 --> 1:38:22.000
Incompetent people.
Nobody knows how to do anything.

1:38:23.791 --> 1:38:25.041
Relax.

1:38:25.125 --> 1:38:27.250
Miguel, breathe. Relax.

1:38:27.750 --> 1:38:29.500
Follow me. Come on.

1:38:35.791 --> 1:38:37.875
<i>Whether it's cold or hot</i>

1:38:37.958 --> 1:38:40.208
<i>You always have the best</i>

1:38:40.291 --> 1:38:42.416
<i>She's not alone, she's with Simón</i>

1:38:42.500 --> 1:38:45.625
<i>From Buenos Aires, Argentina's capital,</i>

1:38:45.708 --> 1:38:49.250
<i>the show you've been waiting for.</i>

1:38:49.333 --> 1:38:54.083
<i>Humor, fun, joy, and a bit of weather.</i>

1:38:54.166 --> 1:38:55.791
<i>With you tonight,</i>

1:38:55.875 --> 1:38:58.166
<i>our star host,</i>

1:38:58.250 --> 1:38:59.333
<i>yes,</i>

1:38:59.416 --> 1:39:03.500
<i>Mery Oliva!</i>

1:39:03.583 --> 1:39:06.000
THE GREAT WEATHER SHOW
HOST: MERY OLIVA

1:39:06.083 --> 1:39:07.833
<i>Mery's here with Simón</i>

1:39:07.916 --> 1:39:09.916
<i>She's beautiful, she's a star</i>

1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:11.791
<i>Give Simón a kiss, it's a party</i>

1:39:11.875 --> 1:39:14.541
<i>If it rains, no need to worry</i>

1:39:14.625 --> 1:39:16.875
<i>We can weather the storm</i>

1:39:16.958 --> 1:39:18.291
<i>Mery's here</i>

1:39:19.166 --> 1:39:20.375
<i>And she's with Simón</i>

1:39:21.416 --> 1:39:22.875
<i>Mery's here</i>

1:39:23.708 --> 1:39:25.125
<i>And she's with Simón</i>

1:39:26.416 --> 1:39:27.250
Amazing.

1:39:27.958 --> 1:39:28.833
Goddess.

1:39:32.166 --> 1:39:33.000
Idol.

1:39:34.041 --> 1:39:35.875
Good evening.

1:39:35.958 --> 1:39:38.916
Welcome to <i>The Great Weather Show.</i>

1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:41.708
Hello, my band. Thank you.

1:39:41.791 --> 1:39:44.625
<i>Thank you for tuning in.</i>

1:39:44.708 --> 1:39:46.125
<i>Rain or shine.</i>

1:39:46.208 --> 1:39:47.375
<i>we sing regardless.</i>

1:39:47.458 --> 1:39:51.250
It's always the guys, isn't it?

1:39:51.333 --> 1:39:52.458
Always the same thing.

1:39:52.541 --> 1:39:55.250
-Doesn't she?
-Quiet.

1:39:55.333 --> 1:39:59.000
Do you want to know the weather?

1:39:59.083 --> 1:40:00.041
Yes.

1:40:01.041 --> 1:40:04.333
We have great news, Simón,

1:40:04.416 --> 1:40:07.291
because tonight and tomorrow morning,

1:40:07.375 --> 1:40:09.416
we'll have clear skies

1:40:09.500 --> 1:40:11.791
with a high of 28.

1:40:11.875 --> 1:40:13.250
Great.

1:40:13.333 --> 1:40:16.250
-With just some mild winds--
-Lies!

1:40:19.041 --> 1:40:22.708
-Excuse me.
-Can someone tell me what he's doing here?

1:40:22.791 --> 1:40:27.416
Buenos Aires and surrounding areas,
today, at 11:07 sharp,

1:40:27.500 --> 1:40:31.166
we'll get the biggest hail storm
you've ever seen.

1:40:31.250 --> 1:40:34.875
Just a wild, unpredictable storm.

1:40:34.958 --> 1:40:37.875
When meteorological radars detect it,

1:40:37.958 --> 1:40:39.083
it will be too late.

1:40:39.166 --> 1:40:41.625
And phone apps

1:40:41.708 --> 1:40:44.000
won't even see it, so don't trust them.

1:40:44.083 --> 1:40:46.833
-Cut to commercial.
-Sixteen points and counting.

1:40:46.916 --> 1:40:50.083
-What should I do?
-Touch that button and I'll kill you.

1:40:50.166 --> 1:40:53.708
I know I was wrong last time, I know,

1:40:54.291 --> 1:40:56.125
but give me another chance.

1:40:56.208 --> 1:40:58.583
It's all I ask,
for all the times I was right.

1:40:58.666 --> 1:41:01.541
I need backup in Studio One, do you copy?

1:41:02.250 --> 1:41:04.500
-Domingo, please.
-Believe me, please.

1:41:04.583 --> 1:41:06.208
Don't be an ass, it's Miguel.

1:41:06.291 --> 1:41:08.458
If you're at home watching,

1:41:08.541 --> 1:41:10.333
don't go anywhere.

1:41:10.416 --> 1:41:11.458
Warn your family.

1:41:11.541 --> 1:41:14.041
-Put on tense music, Conejo.
-Post it.

1:41:14.125 --> 1:41:16.875
-Facebook, Instagram, Twitter.
-Come on, Conejo.

1:41:17.625 --> 1:41:19.750
Use #Hail.

1:41:19.833 --> 1:41:22.041
Please. Worst case scenario,

1:41:22.833 --> 1:41:24.416
everything will be fine.

1:41:24.500 --> 1:41:27.583
You'll just have to stay inside for a bit,

1:41:27.666 --> 1:41:29.958
but I swear I'm not wrong.

1:41:30.041 --> 1:41:32.166
It will be a historic storm.

1:41:32.250 --> 1:41:35.583
-Twenty one points.
-Yeah! Hey, eyes forward.

1:41:36.791 --> 1:41:39.833
11:07, we don't have much time. Please.

1:41:39.916 --> 1:41:43.583
Please, for the love of God, believe me.

1:41:49.041 --> 1:41:50.458
Not a cloud in the sky.

1:41:51.375 --> 1:41:52.875
It's almost 11:00.

1:41:55.541 --> 1:41:59.625
-11:07.
-So precise. 11:07.

1:42:00.208 --> 1:42:02.250
Look, two things can happen here.

1:42:02.333 --> 1:42:04.875
Either the world ends at 11:07

1:42:05.541 --> 1:42:08.958
and you're back on Monday
after I parade you around the city,

1:42:09.583 --> 1:42:10.750
or you're wrong again

1:42:11.708 --> 1:42:13.208
and you go live in Stockholm.

1:42:14.333 --> 1:42:17.250
-Mery's asking if she should wait.
-I'm coming.

1:42:29.791 --> 1:42:31.416
What's your wish, Grandpa?

1:42:34.208 --> 1:42:35.250
To die.

1:42:36.041 --> 1:42:39.041
Dad, don't talk like that.

1:42:39.125 --> 1:42:42.041
-I can't with this thing.
-I'll just get a match.

1:42:42.125 --> 1:42:44.833
-Such trouble.
-There, Virginia. Like that.

1:42:44.916 --> 1:42:48.083
Blow the candles out, Dad.
He can't understand.

1:42:48.166 --> 1:42:49.625
There we go. Nice.

1:42:49.708 --> 1:42:52.583
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1:42:52.666 --> 1:42:55.375
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1:42:55.458 --> 1:42:57.875
<i>Happy birthday, dear Dad</i>

1:42:57.958 --> 1:42:59.250
<i>Happy birthday--</i>

1:42:59.333 --> 1:43:00.958
-Enjoy it, it's for you.
-Want a selfie?

1:43:01.041 --> 1:43:03.500
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1:43:03.583 --> 1:43:05.750
-Smile.
-Hey!

1:43:05.833 --> 1:43:09.625
-We all need to go inside.
-Are you kidding me, Luis?

1:43:09.708 --> 1:43:12.250
You vanish for two days,
you don't help at all,

1:43:12.333 --> 1:43:14.416
now you're ruining my dad's birthday.

1:43:14.500 --> 1:43:16.208
Marisa, we'll talk after.

1:43:16.291 --> 1:43:19.583
A huge fucking storm is coming at 11:07.

1:43:20.416 --> 1:43:21.250
Let's go.

1:43:21.791 --> 1:43:23.875
A huge fucking storm.

1:43:24.458 --> 1:43:26.625
Who says? That Miguel clown?

1:43:26.708 --> 1:43:30.166
Yes, that Miguel clown, Horacio.
Move your asses!

1:43:30.250 --> 1:43:31.583
Let's go.

1:43:31.666 --> 1:43:34.666
We'll blow these out inside.
Miguel says so. Come on.

1:45:25.791 --> 1:45:27.250
Get away from the windows.

1:45:27.333 --> 1:45:29.125
Move back, come on.

1:45:29.208 --> 1:45:31.666
It's coming.

1:45:31.750 --> 1:45:32.750
It's the big one.

1:45:32.833 --> 1:45:34.291
Huge.

1:45:35.291 --> 1:45:37.458
What are you doing? Get inside!

1:45:37.541 --> 1:45:39.666
Inside. Take the kid.

1:45:39.750 --> 1:45:42.250
-Go inside now.
-Where are you going?

1:45:42.333 --> 1:45:44.208
We forgot my dad.

1:45:44.291 --> 1:45:46.875
-Marisa, I'll get him.
-Kill me.

1:45:46.958 --> 1:45:47.958
I'll go.

1:45:49.250 --> 1:45:51.041
-Let's go.
-Leave me.

1:45:51.125 --> 1:45:54.125
-Leave me.
-No way. Let's go.

1:45:54.208 --> 1:45:56.666
Don't take me. No!

1:45:57.250 --> 1:45:58.083
Kill me.

1:45:59.833 --> 1:46:01.041
Kill me.

1:46:03.958 --> 1:46:05.875
Look at that.

1:46:07.208 --> 1:46:08.291
Stop.

1:46:08.916 --> 1:46:10.291
Dumbass.

1:46:10.375 --> 1:46:13.333
Son of a bitch, you won't let me die.

1:46:13.416 --> 1:46:15.041
-Dad.
-Take him out.

1:46:15.125 --> 1:46:16.708
-Take him out.
-Yes.

1:46:17.458 --> 1:46:18.500
Pick him up.

1:46:19.458 --> 1:46:20.583
Let's go. Up.

1:46:30.750 --> 1:46:31.583
Open.

1:46:31.666 --> 1:46:32.958
No, don't open the door.

1:46:33.041 --> 1:46:34.166
-Open.
-Don't.

1:46:34.250 --> 1:46:36.083
Open the door.

1:46:36.166 --> 1:46:38.250
Are you serious? Open.

1:46:38.333 --> 1:46:39.958
Open the door for him.

1:46:40.041 --> 1:46:41.791
Come on.

1:46:41.875 --> 1:46:44.333
-I can't leave the cart.
-Just leave it.

1:46:44.416 --> 1:46:46.208
-Okay.
-Thank you.

1:46:46.291 --> 1:46:47.875
Help me.

1:47:02.250 --> 1:47:03.666
Careful.

1:47:05.958 --> 1:47:07.458
-Look out.
-Be careful.

1:47:07.541 --> 1:47:09.250
-No.
-Watch out.

1:47:12.583 --> 1:47:13.583
Look out.

1:47:30.166 --> 1:47:32.583
I took out an all risks insurance,

1:47:32.666 --> 1:47:35.208
including hail,

1:47:35.291 --> 1:47:37.791
earthquakes, and tsunamis.

1:47:39.750 --> 1:47:40.583

SUBWAY
BUENOS AIRES

1:48:46.083 --> 1:48:48.916
We are witnessing a storm that is truly--

1:50:23.416 --> 1:50:25.958
<i>Provincial reaction was key.</i>

1:50:26.041 --> 1:50:29.500
<i>The country responded with a rare urgency.</i>

1:50:30.166 --> 1:50:31.333
<i>There's serious damage,</i>

1:50:31.416 --> 1:50:34.291
<i>rebuilding will take a long time,</i>

1:50:34.375 --> 1:50:35.500
<i>but let's focus on--</i>

1:50:35.583 --> 1:50:37.166
This one or this one, Miguel?

1:50:38.875 --> 1:50:39.833
-That one.
-Great.

1:50:40.708 --> 1:50:42.000
DON'T LET IT GET TO YOUR HEAD

1:50:45.375 --> 1:50:47.416
WE'LL SEE
DON'T LET IT GET TO YOUR HEAD

1:51:05.916 --> 1:51:07.833
SEE YOU THIS WEEKEND. LOVE YOU.

1:51:19.666 --> 1:51:20.541
How are you?

1:51:20.625 --> 1:51:21.875
Good.

1:51:22.458 --> 1:51:23.375
Can I sit?

1:51:24.083 --> 1:51:25.416
Yes.

1:51:30.958 --> 1:51:31.958
Oh, the ball.

1:51:32.041 --> 1:51:32.916
Yeah.

1:51:56.958 --> 1:51:57.791
Miguel,

1:51:57.875 --> 1:52:00.791
how does it feel to save
thousands of lives?

1:52:01.416 --> 1:52:03.583
Anyone in my place would've done the same.

1:52:04.250 --> 1:52:08.708
Miguel, how did you know
the hail was coming at that exact time?

1:52:16.750 --> 1:52:18.666
Someone else should be here with me.

1:52:21.166 --> 1:52:23.541
This plaque is missing a name.

1:52:24.833 --> 1:52:28.250
I wasn't the one who knew it was coming

1:52:28.916 --> 1:52:30.750
at 11:07.

1:52:31.333 --> 1:52:32.208
What?

1:52:32.291 --> 1:52:33.333
What does he mean?

1:52:34.416 --> 1:52:35.458
Who was it then?

1:53:02.625 --> 1:53:08.000
PRESS

1:53:08.083 --> 1:53:10.958
