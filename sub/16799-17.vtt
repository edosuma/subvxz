WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:02.224
Previously on Elementary...

00:02.270 --> 00:04.192
HOLMES: Shinwell's still engaged
with SBK.

00:04.230 --> 00:06.130
WATSON: He still wants
to bring SBK down,

00:06.170 --> 00:09.230
so he asked me to connect
him with someone from
the Bronx gang squad.

00:09.270 --> 00:10.737
Detective Guzman.

00:10.770 --> 00:12.476
I know Joan is expecting
a call back from me

00:12.510 --> 00:14.728
about her friend, Stonewall?
Shinwell.

00:14.780 --> 00:16.475
I thought he was all
dialed in with SBK.

00:16.510 --> 00:19.070
So Shinwell and
Detective Guzman met today.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.111
He's gonna register him
as a CI.

00:21.150 --> 00:23.186
I have a proposal.

00:23.220 --> 00:24.812
I offer that we train you
to be an informant.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.818
We can teach you the
skills you will require

00:26.860 --> 00:28.213
to survive that undertaking.

00:39.870 --> 00:41.462
(gunshot)

00:41.500 --> 00:42.762
(screams)

00:42.810 --> 00:44.630
Where's the lady Frances?

00:44.670 --> 00:47.070
_ What? _
It's a Simple question.

00:47.110 --> 00:49.203
What did you do with her?
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.639
That's a bad way to start.

00:53.550 --> 00:54.517
Please...
(gunshot)

00:54.550 --> 00:56.142
(crying out)

00:56.190 --> 00:59.614
This thing I'm doing
is called a "six-pack."

00:59.660 --> 01:02.788
Elbows, knees, ankles.

01:02.830 --> 01:06.459
When I run out of those,
I'll improvise.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.297
Please, this is a mistake!

01:08.330 --> 01:09.524
You've got the wrong guy!

01:09.570 --> 01:12.437
No. We know you took her.

01:12.470 --> 01:14.597
You're keeping her
somewhere,

01:14.640 --> 01:16.198
and the gentleman
you took her from

01:16.240 --> 01:17.264
would like her back.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.107
(gunshot, pained cry)

01:19.140 --> 01:21.700
(gunshot, pained cry
over headphones)

01:21.740 --> 01:24.140
GUNMAN: So, I'll ask again.

01:24.180 --> 01:27.843
Where... is... Frances?

01:27.880 --> 01:30.144
MAN: Please,
please don't kill me.

01:30.190 --> 01:32.658
GUNMAN: Why not?
She wasn't yours to take.

01:32.690 --> 01:34.317
Now you're facing
the consequences.

01:34.360 --> 01:38.126
(gunshot, pained screaming)

01:38.160 --> 01:40.196
(grunting)

01:40.230 --> 01:42.198
*

01:49.310 --> 01:52.177
(timer beeps)

01:58.610 --> 02:00.544
(exhales)

02:03.250 --> 02:05.138
I still don't see
the point of all this.

02:05.190 --> 02:06.885
You know I know
how to box,

02:06.920 --> 02:08.410
you know I know
how to play chess.

02:08.460 --> 02:11.179
This isn't chess
or boxing.

02:11.230 --> 02:12.857
It's chess boxing.
It's its own sport.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.151
Admittedly, it's not
as popular here

02:14.200 --> 02:16.589
as it is in other countries.

02:16.630 --> 02:18.689
And this is supposed to
help me be a CI. how?

02:18.730 --> 02:20.561
The critical skill when
alternating rounds

02:20.600 --> 02:23.899
of chess and boxing is
not a mastery of either.

02:23.940 --> 02:26.238
It is the ability to quickly
shift one's mental state.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.704
_ Adrenaline clouds _
higher cognitive function

02:29.750 --> 02:31.206
and, conversely,
deep concentration

02:31.250 --> 02:33.218
slows reflexes.

02:33.250 --> 02:34.911
So imagine you've infiltrated
a target's office,

02:34.950 --> 02:36.781
and you're in the middle of
trying to decode their passwords

02:36.820 --> 02:38.583
and you're discovered and you
have to defend yourself.

02:38.620 --> 02:41.214
Or you're running
to evade capture,

02:41.260 --> 02:44.388
and you have to calm
yourself and pick a lock.

02:44.430 --> 02:47.297
Think you got me mixed up
with James Bond.

02:47.330 --> 02:48.797
Remind me, which one
of us wants to topple

02:48.830 --> 02:51.196
an organized-crime
syndicate from the inside?

02:51.230 --> 02:52.788
(cell phone chimes)

02:56.510 --> 02:57.966
Unfortunately,
we're going to have to

02:58.010 --> 02:59.807
continue this another time.

03:02.280 --> 03:04.373
So you're just gonna leave,
just like that?

03:04.410 --> 03:08.813
As I said, shift quickly.
Duty calls.

03:10.850 --> 03:12.613
GREGSON: BulletPoint's still
in the pilot phase.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.356
City's trying it out
in a handful of neighborhoods.

03:15.390 --> 03:18.484
HOLMES: Sensors triangulate
the gunshot to within 20 feet,

03:18.530 --> 03:20.452
and then notify the department
within moments.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.229
GREGSON: An hour and a half ago,
it picked up multiple shots

03:22.270 --> 03:23.623
from this corner.

03:23.670 --> 03:26.298
It also recorded the voice
of the shooter.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.796
He was torturing
someone for info.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.263
Wanted to know where
the guy had taken

03:30.310 --> 03:31.629
a woman named Frances.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.001
Taken as in kidnapped?

03:33.040 --> 03:34.701
I'm not sure.
That's why I called.

03:34.740 --> 03:36.708
So, if there's
a woman in danger,

03:36.750 --> 03:38.638
we would have to find the
shooter as quickly as possible.

03:38.680 --> 03:41.376
Was the victim taken to
the hospital or the morgue?

03:41.420 --> 03:42.682
GREGSON:
That's just the thing.

03:42.720 --> 03:44.711
Neither.
According to BulletPoint,

03:44.750 --> 03:46.911
the shooting occurred right
here, but when our guys arrived

03:46.960 --> 03:48.985
at the scene,
there was no blood,

03:49.020 --> 03:50.851
no slugs, no body.

03:50.890 --> 03:54.997
CSU says these cracks are fresh,

03:55.030 --> 03:56.861
and that's about
all we got.

03:56.900 --> 03:58.265
So you think perhaps
the shooting

03:58.300 --> 03:59.858
took place
inside the car?

03:59.900 --> 04:01.959
That would explain
the complete lack of evidence.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.639
Well, the audio is
all we got, so yes,

04:04.670 --> 04:06.399
that would fit with that theory.

04:06.440 --> 04:08.772
So we have a shooting to solve,

04:08.810 --> 04:12.746
and a woman's life potentially
hanging in the balance.

04:12.780 --> 04:13.769
And our crime scene has
literally driven away.

04:50.890 --> 04:52.380
GUNMAN (on recording):
You're keeping her somewhere,

04:52.420 --> 04:54.718
and the gentleman
you took her from

04:54.760 --> 04:55.909
would like her back.

04:55.960 --> 04:59.748
(gunshots, pained cries)

04:59.800 --> 05:02.098
GUNMAN: So, I'll ask again.

05:02.130 --> 05:05.463
Where... is... Frances?

05:05.500 --> 05:07.798
MAN: Please,
please don't kill me.

05:07.840 --> 05:11.662
GUNMAN: Why not?
She wasn't yours to take.

05:11.710 --> 05:14.338
Now you're facing
the consequences.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.541
(gunshot, pained scream)

05:16.580 --> 05:19.572
GUNMAN: Last chance.
MAN: Please, no!

05:19.620 --> 05:21.872
(gunshot, running footsteps)

05:21.920 --> 05:23.683
(car door shuts,
tires screech)

05:23.720 --> 05:26.518
(vehicles driving off)

05:26.560 --> 05:28.414
Do we know if he's dead?

05:28.460 --> 05:31.486
Do we know who he is,
or who Frances is?

05:31.530 --> 05:33.657
It's still early
in the investigation.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.395
We're asking
the same questions.

05:35.430 --> 05:37.523
We've got people
canvassing the neighborhood,

05:37.570 --> 05:38.821
checking the local hospitals,

05:38.870 --> 05:40.064
seeing if anyone was
reported missing.

05:40.100 --> 05:42.739
But given what
we just heard,

05:42.770 --> 05:45.102
it's hard to imagine
that the victim survived.

05:45.140 --> 05:47.574
Any chance you sent the police
to the wrong street?

05:47.610 --> 05:50.101
The system's been tested
a hundred times, Michael.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.914
And the mayor's office has the
stats, so you know it works.

05:52.950 --> 05:54.941
Emily Gray, Councilman
Slessinger's chief of staff.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.743
HOLMES: I can vouch
that the shooting

05:56.790 --> 05:58.678
took place where
BulletPoint said it did.

05:58.720 --> 06:01.052
I found a shell casing a little
further down the block.

06:01.090 --> 06:03.786
It likely fell from the vehicle
that drove the crime scene away.

06:03.830 --> 06:06.458
Its odor confirmed that
it had been fired recently,

06:06.500 --> 06:09.469
and its caliber matched
the system's analy5is.

06:09.500 --> 06:10.865
I'd like to ask more about
how the system works,

06:10.900 --> 06:12.492
what it records and when.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.861
Our sensors listen for gunshots.

06:14.900 --> 06:17.437
Once one is detected,
then it begins recording

06:17.470 --> 06:19.609
all the audio
for an agreed period of time.

06:19.640 --> 06:20.971
That arrangement
with the city is

06:21.010 --> 06:23.103
ten seconds before
the first gunshot

06:23.150 --> 06:24.799
until 30 seconds
after the last one.

06:24.850 --> 06:26.647
How does the system know
to record

06:26.680 --> 06:29.478
ten seconds
before the gunshots?

06:29.520 --> 06:30.782
Are you saying
that this thing is

06:30.820 --> 06:32.617
bugging the city 24/7?

06:32.660 --> 06:33.809
Yeah.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.054
Sort of.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.819
Kind of like your phone,
or any device

06:36.860 --> 06:39.420
that's voice-activated
by saying "Siri" or "Alexa."

06:39.460 --> 06:41.428
They're all listening
all the time,

06:41.460 --> 06:42.529
because they need to hear
when we need them,

06:42.570 --> 06:43.559
but they don't start
paying attention

06:43.600 --> 06:45.420
until we do.

06:45.470 --> 06:46.698
It kind of works
the same way here,

06:46.740 --> 06:49.504
where instead of "Siri,"
the signal is gunfire,

06:49.540 --> 06:52.008
and by "paying attention,"
it means saving the audio.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.531
The data that
Cosmo's referring to

06:54.580 --> 06:55.706
goes into a buffer.

06:55.740 --> 06:57.549
So if there are no incidents,

06:57.580 --> 06:59.514
then it just gets deleted
without anyone ever hearing it.

06:59.550 --> 07:02.883
And this is all done under the
strict oversight of the city.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.979
Well, that's okay, then,
'cause governments never abuse

07:05.020 --> 07:06.146
the _surveillance of their
Citizenry, do they?

07:07.520 --> 07:10.227
I would like copies
of your data, all of it,

07:10.260 --> 07:11.625
for my own analysis.

07:11.660 --> 07:13.594
Whatever you need.

07:13.630 --> 07:15.598
(whispering indistinctly)

07:15.630 --> 07:17.063
WATSON: It's a little odd
having city hall

07:17.100 --> 07:18.624
looking over our shoulders.

07:18.670 --> 07:19.739
Well, get used to it
on this one,

07:19.770 --> 07:21.658
it's a mayoral election year,

07:21.700 --> 07:23.634
and Miss Gray's boss,
Councilman Slessinger,

07:23.670 --> 07:25.001
wants the job.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.576
He's running on a platform

07:26.610 --> 07:28.908
that His Honor isn't
strong on law and order.

07:28.940 --> 07:31.579
Making initiatives like
BulletPoint cannon fodder.

07:31.610 --> 07:33.749
If the headline
turns out to be

07:33.780 --> 07:35.611
"BulletPoint rescued
a battered woman,"

07:35.650 --> 07:37.481
everyone's gonna race
to take credit.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.613
And if it fails, they'll all
want someone to blame.

07:39.660 --> 07:40.615
That said, none of it's

07:40.660 --> 07:42.548
your problem.

07:42.590 --> 07:44.251
I'll play umbrella
and catch whatever's falling.

07:44.290 --> 07:46.793
You two just work the case.
(cell phone rings)

07:46.830 --> 07:47.694
Hello?

07:47.730 --> 07:49.618
GUZMAN: Hey.
I catch you at a bad time?

07:49.670 --> 07:50.625
No. What's up?

07:50.670 --> 07:52.558
Just wanted to let you
and your partner know

07:52.600 --> 07:53.760
it doesn't look like
Shinwell's cover was blown.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.769
Right now we're thinking
the drive-by was

07:56.810 --> 07:59.608
retaliation for some
SBK action.

07:59.640 --> 08:00.800
Wait, what drive-by?

08:00.840 --> 08:02.569
Are you saying Shinwell
was shot?

08:02.610 --> 08:03.838
(door closes)

08:03.880 --> 08:04.904
WATSON:
Why didn't you tell us?

08:04.950 --> 08:06.508
There was nothing to tell.

08:06.550 --> 08:09.883
Nothing to tell?
You were shot at.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.184
You do get that
I'm in a gang, right?
Well, that doesn't matter.

08:12.220 --> 08:14.051
Guzman said you were gonna
talk to us about it, so talk.

08:16.260 --> 08:19.229
It happened last night after
me and Sherlock left the gym.

08:19.260 --> 08:20.591
Just a block from here.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.666
This car rolls up,

08:22.700 --> 08:24.964
the driver took a few shots,
and he sped off.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.662
Did you see what
he looked like?

08:27.700 --> 08:29.861
No, I was too busy getting
my ass down a stoop.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.128
Green Chevy,

08:32.170 --> 08:35.674
maybe ten years old.
That's all I know.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.048
Leave it alone.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.310
We can't just
do nothing.

08:41.350 --> 08:43.739
Yeah, we can.
And that's my point.

08:43.790 --> 08:46.611
A few days ago,
some boys from SBK,

08:46.660 --> 08:48.309
they hit Los Espectros.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.624
We figure Los Espectros
hit back.

08:50.660 --> 08:52.696
The streets are quiet
ever since then,

08:52.730 --> 08:54.698
so we just gonna leave it alone.

08:57.730 --> 08:59.595
I'll be fine.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.938
I promise, Doc.

09:05.740 --> 09:08.607
Whoa.
Excuse me.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.744
Uh, what's all that about?

09:10.780 --> 09:12.077
Shh.

09:12.110 --> 09:14.249
(truck engine struggles,
turns over)

09:16.720 --> 09:18.585
(truck drives away)

09:18.620 --> 09:19.882
Sorry, now you can speak.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.251
You were listening
to their truck?

09:21.290 --> 09:22.257
In BulletPoint's audio,

09:22.290 --> 09:25.179
the assailants, plural,

09:25.230 --> 09:26.857
can be heard arriving
in one vehicle.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.697
A sports car
or a small coup.

09:28.730 --> 09:30.698
After torturing and probably
killing their victim,

09:30.730 --> 09:32.027
two vehicles depart

09:32.070 --> 09:33.731
and the second one's
much larger-- a truck.

09:33.770 --> 09:35.362
So the truck was
driven there earlier

09:35.400 --> 09:37.265
by the victim,
and then he was ambushed.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.164
So between the sports
car and the truck,

09:39.210 --> 09:41.735
our mobile crime scene is
probably the truck.

09:41.780 --> 09:43.372
I also heard a good deal
of metal rattling.

09:43.410 --> 09:46.106
A ladder on the rear frame,
tools in the back.

09:46.150 --> 09:49.711
I suspect that our victim was
a manual laborer of some sort.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.286
I've passed that on to Marcus
and he's checking to see

09:51.320 --> 09:53.288
if any such trucks
have been reported missing.

09:53.320 --> 09:57.757
In the meantime, I've been
summoning a variety of workers

09:57.790 --> 09:59.621
to see if I can narrow the field

09:59.660 --> 10:02.254
by the sounds I hear
when they come and go.

10:02.300 --> 10:04.359
Wait, you had work
done while I was out?

10:04.400 --> 10:07.392
No. I've been
a very fickle decorator.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.806
I have, uh, ordered
and then declined

10:09.840 --> 10:12.229
a new carpet,
crown molding, new bathtub.

10:12.270 --> 10:14.306
You're just in time
to pick out some new
wallpaper for your bedroom.

10:14.340 --> 10:16.808
You know, since you're
gonna return it anyway,

10:16.850 --> 10:19.068
just surprise me.

10:20.780 --> 10:22.680
How's Shinwell?
Fine.

10:22.720 --> 10:24.039
But he and Guzman are less
concerned about this drive-by

10:24.090 --> 10:25.819
than I'd like them to be.

10:25.850 --> 10:26.987
They think it's just
gang business as usual,

10:27.020 --> 10:29.079
and that we should
just leave it alone.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.724
To be fair,

10:30.760 --> 10:32.751
the perpetrator did shoot
like a duck, drive like a duck,

10:32.800 --> 10:35.428
and Shinwell rarely hangs out
with anyone other than ducks.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.997
So, you think they're right?
We should just leave it alone?

10:38.030 --> 10:40.828
No, but I do agree

10:40.870 --> 10:43.430
there's little point in trying
to identifying the shooter.

10:43.470 --> 10:47.304
He mentioned that the car
was a mid-20005 green Chew.

10:47.340 --> 10:50.138
So I thought I'd at
least look into that.

10:50.180 --> 10:51.704
(phone ringing)

10:51.750 --> 10:53.240
Speaking of mystery vehicles.
Marcus?

10:53.280 --> 10:54.770
BELL:
You called it.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.276
Contracting company in Astoria

10:56.320 --> 10:57.947
reported
a stolen truck this morning.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.811
They said a drywaller
had it out on a job yesterday,

11:00.860 --> 11:03.749
and never came back.
Guy's name is Darren Azoff.

11:05.190 --> 11:06.896
(Azoff screaming on recording)

11:06.930 --> 11:09.023
GUNMAN:
Where's the lady Frances?
AZOFF: What?

11:09.060 --> 11:11.790
GUNMAN: It's a simple question.
What did you do with her?

11:11.830 --> 11:13.832
AZOFF: I don't know
what you're talking about!

11:13.870 --> 11:16.430
What do you think, Mrs. Azoff?

11:16.470 --> 11:17.869
Does that sound
like your husband?

11:17.910 --> 11:21.368
Yeah. That's him.

11:23.280 --> 11:26.249
You say there's
a chance he's alive?

11:26.280 --> 11:28.817
A slim one, yeah.

11:28.850 --> 11:32.081
Do you know who Frances is?

11:32.120 --> 11:35.419
Darren was cheating on me.

11:35.460 --> 11:38.384
I've known about it
for months.

11:38.430 --> 11:40.193
When he didn't come home
last night,

11:40.230 --> 11:42.960
I figured he ran off
with his girlfriend.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.262
Is her name is Frances?

11:44.300 --> 11:46.188
I couldn't tell you
anything about her.

11:46.230 --> 11:48.130
It's _not like Darren
was bringing her around.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.766
But you want to know

11:51.810 --> 11:52.799
who that man

11:52.840 --> 11:53.875
was asking him about?

11:53.910 --> 11:55.935
She'd be my best guess.

11:55.980 --> 11:58.244
Say you're right. It's possible
the man on the tape

11:58.280 --> 12:00.817
was working
for some old flame of hers.

12:00.850 --> 12:03.341
He made it sound like Darren
was keeping her someplace.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.142
Do you have any idea
where that might be?

12:06.520 --> 12:07.851
I'm sorry. No.

12:09.020 --> 12:12.797
Hi, um, did you husband
leave this behind?

12:12.830 --> 12:16.197
Yeah. I yelled at him
about that the other day.

12:16.230 --> 12:17.458
He's always tracking
stuff from work

12:17.500 --> 12:19.161
into the house,
ruining my towels.

12:19.200 --> 12:22.829
Right, yeah. This is,
this is PVC solvent cement.

12:22.870 --> 12:25.862
It dissolves the surfaces
of PVC pipes to form a weld.

12:25.910 --> 12:27.502
Now, Mr. Azoff is a drywaller.

12:27.540 --> 12:29.508
He'd have no reason
to use PVC cement.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.041
Also, I looked around the
apartment, and there's

12:31.080 --> 12:32.968
no recent work of this
type been done here.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.976
Maybe it's from work he did
at a place he's got Frances.

12:35.020 --> 12:36.544
BELL: I'll check
with Con Ed

12:36.580 --> 12:38.548
and the cable company,
see if he has any accounts

12:38.590 --> 12:39.818
in his name

12:39.860 --> 12:41.282
for another residence.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.224
(sniffles)

12:46.090 --> 12:47.921
(exhales)

12:51.400 --> 12:53.994
My name's not Frances.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.837
It's Marjorie.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.801
And I know
what you're thinking, but no.

12:59.840 --> 13:02.206
Darren wasn't hiding
some other woman

13:02.240 --> 13:04.276
named Frances from me.

13:04.310 --> 13:05.800
He loved me.

13:05.850 --> 13:07.875
You had a break-in recently,

13:07.920 --> 13:10.411
sometime in the
last couple of days?

13:10.450 --> 13:11.986
There's a window been
forced open in the back,

13:12.020 --> 13:13.988
and the scratches on
the wood are still fresh.

13:14.020 --> 13:16.250
I haven't noticed
anything missing.

13:16.290 --> 13:18.952
Do you mind
if we take a look around?

13:18.990 --> 13:21.527
You got a warrant?

13:21.560 --> 13:23.027
BELL:
No, but remember,

13:23.070 --> 13:25.994
Darren might still be alive.
If he is, he needs help.

13:26.030 --> 13:28.032
If there's something inside
that could help us help him,

13:28.070 --> 13:30.504
you really want us to waste
time getting a warrant?

13:35.880 --> 13:38.201
(door closes)

13:38.250 --> 13:41.549
I can see how you couldn't tell
there was a break-in.

13:46.490 --> 13:48.219
This is drwNall dust.

13:48.260 --> 13:50.854
These are drips of paint.
They don't match the walls.

13:50.890 --> 13:53.324
BELL: Gonna take a wild
guess here and say Darren

13:53.360 --> 13:55.897
was stealing valuables
from his drywall jobs.

13:55.930 --> 13:58.160
Probably fencing them, too,

13:58.200 --> 13:59.997
which is why he could
afford a second home.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.564
You sure nothing's missing?

14:01.600 --> 14:04.239
I was telling the truth,
I honestly don't know.

14:04.270 --> 14:06.602
I do.

14:06.640 --> 14:08.130
This looks like research
that Azoff was doing

14:08.180 --> 14:09.636
on one of the items
I assume he stole.

14:09.680 --> 14:13.070
He took a photograph
of it in this room,

14:13.120 --> 14:15.577
presumably to help him sell
it, but it's not here now.

14:15.620 --> 14:17.315
We've been working
under a misconception,

14:17.350 --> 14:20.285
that the Lady Frances
was a woman, but it's not.

14:20.320 --> 14:21.981
It's a stolen
Vintage gwtar.

14:22.020 --> 14:23.021
Worth around $5 million.

14:30.930 --> 14:32.261
GREGSON:
So Azoff was shot over a guitar?

14:32.300 --> 14:34.234
HOLMES:
Uh, not just any guitar.

14:34.270 --> 14:35.567
According to Azoff's research,

14:35.600 --> 14:37.636
the guitar
once belonged to someone

14:37.670 --> 14:39.365
named Eric Clapton.
Have you heard of him?

14:40.540 --> 14:43.373
Yeah. We've heard of him.

14:43.410 --> 14:46.402
Still. Five million bucks?

14:46.450 --> 14:47.917
Apparently, she's
the perfect storm

14:47.950 --> 14:49.941
of provenance,
quality and legend.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.447
She's a 1957 Carfax Desperado,

14:52.490 --> 14:54.253
a year and make which
has already become

14:54.290 --> 14:56.588
known the _"Stradivarius
of electric gwtars."

14:56.620 --> 14:59.180
They fetch up to a
million dollars on the
collector's market,

14:59.230 --> 15:01.118
and that's without
the celebrity pedigree.

15:01.160 --> 15:02.229
If you add to
that the fact

15:02.260 --> 15:03.591
that apparently
it went missing

15:03.630 --> 15:06.190
during Mr. Clapton's
1971 tour...

15:06.230 --> 15:08.960
Then you've got a piece of
rock history worth killing over.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.501
And we're sure
our shooter's the one

15:10.540 --> 15:12.201
who took it
from Azoff's girlfriend's house?

15:12.240 --> 15:14.333
Detectives canvassed the block.
A neighbor reported

15:14.380 --> 15:17.008
seeing a man leave the house
with a guitar

15:17.050 --> 15:19.348
less than an hour
after Azoff's shooting.

15:19.380 --> 15:20.540
"Sure" might be
overstating it,

15:20.580 --> 15:22.468
but the timeline fits.

15:22.520 --> 15:24.545
Will this development
be made public?

15:24.590 --> 15:26.615
I'm asking because the mayor
will want to express his relief

15:26.650 --> 15:28.379
_ that Frances
isn't a woman in danger.

15:28.420 --> 15:29.557
EMILY: Yeah, at which point
he'll blame BulletPoint

15:29.590 --> 15:30.579
for creating confusion,

15:30.630 --> 15:31.654
and suggest we scrap
the whole thing.

15:31.690 --> 15:33.396
I didn't say that.

15:33.430 --> 15:34.397
Is he going to be adding
that we're all still

15:34.430 --> 15:36.227
looking forward to a win here?
Obviously, yes.

15:36.260 --> 15:37.659
GREGSON: So, can I
put you both down

15:37.700 --> 15:39.520
as "still wanting
to catch the killer"?

15:39.570 --> 15:41.697
Because we're taking a vote.

15:41.740 --> 15:43.207
Sorry.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.332
Please.

15:44.370 --> 15:46.668
Thanks to BulletPoint's audio,
we know that the shooter

15:46.710 --> 15:50.146
was in the employ of the last
person to possess the guitar.

15:50.180 --> 15:52.648
Now, whoever he is,
he never publicized having it.

15:52.680 --> 15:54.341
He might have derived his
pleasure from it privately,

15:54.380 --> 15:56.245
but people like that,
they rarely keep

15:56.280 --> 15:58.589
their prizes
completely secret.

15:58.620 --> 16:01.612
So if we can identify him,
obviously, we'll then have

16:01.660 --> 16:02.615
Azoff's shooter.

16:02.660 --> 16:04.150
Okay, so.

16:04.190 --> 16:05.589
We'll let you know

16:05.630 --> 16:07.757
if anything shakes out.
EMILY:
Thank you.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.324
Miss Gray.

16:09.360 --> 16:10.429
Yes?

16:10.470 --> 16:12.665
Your boss,
Councilman Slessinger.

16:12.700 --> 16:14.588
Do you mind giving him
a message?
Okay.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.437
He's been making the cops
his punching bag

16:16.470 --> 16:17.698
_in a lot of
his speeches.

16:17.740 --> 16:20.629
Now, we're smart,
we get politics.

16:20.680 --> 16:21.772
But there's got to be a way

16:21.810 --> 16:23.300
for him to stump

16:23.350 --> 16:24.476
about cutting crime

16:24.510 --> 16:25.670
without making it sound like

16:25.710 --> 16:27.018
we can't do
our jobs.

16:27.050 --> 16:28.642
Captain, it's campaign talk.

16:28.680 --> 16:30.318
I know.

16:30.350 --> 16:32.511
But I'd still like you
to remind him: if he wins,

16:32.550 --> 16:34.609
he's gonna have to work with us.

16:34.660 --> 16:37.424
I'd like that
to go well.

16:37.460 --> 16:38.586
Wouldn't you?

16:38.630 --> 16:42.054
I'll tell him we spoke.

16:44.500 --> 16:45.762
Yeah, if we're done?

16:45.800 --> 16:47.529
Detective Guzman.

16:47.570 --> 16:49.595
Hey. I've been trying
to get in touch your partner.

16:49.640 --> 16:51.460
I keep getting her voice mail.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.375
Mm-hmm. Yeah, she's engaged
in a private conversation

16:53.410 --> 16:55.537
with an expert in vintage
guitars at the moment.

16:55.580 --> 16:58.048
'Course she is.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.547
Can I be of assistance?

16:59.580 --> 17:01.116
Well, I was in the neighborhood,

17:01.150 --> 17:02.742
and I thought
she'd like to see this.

17:02.780 --> 17:05.749
Ballistics came back on a slug

17:05.790 --> 17:09.089
C.S.U. pulled out of a wall
after Shinwell's drive-by.

17:09.120 --> 17:10.758
And it was a match
for bullets collected

17:10.790 --> 17:14.089
from an unsolved
murder case 12 years ago.

17:14.130 --> 17:15.620
Name of the victim
was Jameel Clark.

17:15.660 --> 17:18.390
Mid-level SBK guy.

17:18.430 --> 17:20.091
And this was before Shinwell
got put away,

17:20.140 --> 17:21.698
so it's a good chance
they knew each other.

17:21.740 --> 17:23.139
Have you shared any of this
with him?

17:23.170 --> 17:25.206
No. And I'm not gonna.

17:25.240 --> 17:28.471
A gun used to kill one banger
12 years ago surfaces now,

17:28.510 --> 17:30.705
and is used to shoot at another?

17:30.750 --> 17:32.604
That sounds personal.

17:32.650 --> 17:34.277
And you don't want
to risk him taking matters

17:34.320 --> 17:35.719
into his own hands
until we've, uh,

17:35.750 --> 17:37.240
got a better sense
of what we're dealing with.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.246
That's right. I'll keep digging,

17:39.290 --> 17:41.315
and if, um, anything comes up,
I'll let you know.

17:45.790 --> 17:49.692
How do you know this
isn't the Lady Frances?

17:49.730 --> 17:53.131
Besides me not having a heart
attack every time I drop it?

17:53.170 --> 17:54.694
(sighs)

17:54.740 --> 17:57.129
You know, '57 Desperados,

17:57.170 --> 17:59.468
they may all look alike to you,

17:59.510 --> 18:03.344
but each one has a... a
different piece of wood,

18:03.380 --> 18:04.847
a different stain.

18:04.880 --> 18:08.418
There's a history
to every nick and scratch.

18:08.450 --> 18:12.216
Collectors, they'll pay for
the feel of that history.

18:12.250 --> 18:16.880
Even my beater,
that's worth about... 600 thou.

18:16.920 --> 18:21.198
I am not holding
a $600,000 guitar right now.

18:21.230 --> 18:24.529
Not holding it
like you mean it, no.

18:27.470 --> 18:29.893
So what
do you think?

18:29.940 --> 18:32.408
You think
that's the real Lady Frances?

18:32.440 --> 18:37.207
Unless it's the best forgery
I've ever seen...

18:37.250 --> 18:39.241
Yep.

18:39.280 --> 18:41.874
It's her.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.888
Do you have any idea
what happened to her

18:43.920 --> 18:45.683
after she disappeared?
You said on the phone

18:45.720 --> 18:46.914
that you saw her
in person once?

18:46.950 --> 18:50.750
Yeah. In 2006,

18:50.790 --> 18:54.521
I went to the Bitter End to
check out this guy Joshua Chris,

18:54.560 --> 18:56.357
some Stevie Ray wannabe.

18:56.400 --> 19:01.895
He walked out playing Frances.

19:01.940 --> 19:04.500
I mean, I stared at her
for over an hour.

19:05.740 --> 19:08.470
(playing unplugged
electric guitar)

19:10.810 --> 19:14.268
I tried to track down the kid
after the show,

19:14.320 --> 19:15.742
I-I mean, I even
e-mailed him.

19:15.780 --> 19:19.841
He never got back to me.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.351
Mm, Joshua Chris,

19:23.390 --> 19:27.190
he lives in LA,
he retired from music in 2010.

19:27.230 --> 19:29.824
But we think Frances was stolen
from someone here in New York.

19:29.860 --> 19:33.364
Someone who had drywall work
done recently.

19:33.400 --> 19:37.860
You don't think Chris would've
sold it to someone else, do you?

19:37.910 --> 19:42.802
I don't know. You could call
his old producer, Herman Wolf.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.808
Now, there's a relic
from another time.

19:44.850 --> 19:48.775
But he'd probably know
more than anyone else.

19:48.820 --> 19:52.688
I don't think
I'm gonna have to ask him.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.358
Because he's the one who had it.

19:57.990 --> 20:00.493
Jameel and Shinwell,
they were tight.

20:00.530 --> 20:02.521
Like, inseparable.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.790
But I haven't heard Shin's name
since I was a kid.

20:04.830 --> 20:06.866
He got jumped by some
other gang back then,

20:06.900 --> 20:07.889
and they shot him
a bunch of times,

20:07.940 --> 20:09.339
then he got sent
to Great Meadows.

20:09.370 --> 20:10.860
Yep, that's true,

20:10.910 --> 20:13.902
but he‘s out now and_he's
getting shot at again.

20:13.940 --> 20:15.703
Most recently,

20:15.740 --> 20:17.571
with the same weapon used
to kill your brother.

20:17.610 --> 20:20.613
What?
An attempt was made
on his life last night

20:20.650 --> 20:22.515
and the bullets were a match
for the ones used

20:22.550 --> 20:23.847
at your mother's apartment
12 years ago.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.778
You think it's the same guy?

20:25.820 --> 20:27.549
I think the crimes
are connected.

20:27.590 --> 20:29.455
Now, in this ﬁle, it says that,

20:29.490 --> 20:32.288
at the time of Jameel's murder,
you were asleep in your bedroom,

20:32.330 --> 20:34.548
gunfire woke you up, but
you didn't see anything.

20:34.600 --> 20:35.897
Yeah. That's right.

20:35.930 --> 20:38.364
Well, H was wondering if
you could remember anything

20:38.400 --> 20:39.867
that's not in this file,
you know?

20:39.900 --> 20:41.629
Whether you heard
more than one voice,

20:41.670 --> 20:43.433
whether you heard
any snippets of conversation,

20:43.470 --> 20:45.438
the killers, did they linger
or did they leave straightaway?

20:45.470 --> 20:46.698
Sorry.

20:46.740 --> 20:47.900
I was ten,

20:47.940 --> 20:49.601
and scared.

20:49.640 --> 20:51.699
I stayed in my room
until it was over.

20:51.750 --> 20:52.978
I didn't hear a thing.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.772
What?

20:55.820 --> 20:57.412
Well, I'm familiar
with those projects

20:57.450 --> 20:58.917
where you and your family lived.

20:58.950 --> 21:01.953
Those apartments are too
small not to hear anything.

21:01.990 --> 21:03.924
I think you're withholding
something from me.

21:03.960 --> 21:05.848
Something to keep you
from finding the person

21:05.890 --> 21:07.448
that killed my brother?

21:07.500 --> 21:08.990
You tell me.

21:09.030 --> 21:11.726
Yeah, go to hell.
Look,

21:11.770 --> 21:13.021
if the killer strikes again,
do you want Shinwell's death

21:13.070 --> 21:14.833
on your conscience?

21:14.870 --> 21:17.407
Say I did know something,
why would I tell you?

21:17.440 --> 21:18.737
I've seen what happened
to people that talk,

21:18.770 --> 21:21.477
and I got my sister and
my moms to think about.

21:21.510 --> 21:24.001
Yeah, Shin was Jameel's friend.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.506
But he's a banger.

21:25.550 --> 21:26.847
He chose that life, I didn't.

21:28.550 --> 21:30.848
I got to get to class.

21:33.050 --> 21:34.586
(phone rings)

21:38.060 --> 21:39.687
Hello?

21:39.730 --> 21:42.654
What do you guys want from me?

21:42.700 --> 21:45.328
And what makes you think
I had the Lady Frances?

21:45.370 --> 21:46.894
You lent it to Joshua Chris

21:46.930 --> 21:49.034
when you were courting him
to sign with you.

21:49.070 --> 21:50.662
Oh.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.962
Where did you get that
cock-and-bull story from?

21:53.010 --> 21:55.774
Joshua Chris.
(chuckles)

21:55.810 --> 21:57.072
He might've been willing to
keep your secret back then,

21:57.110 --> 21:58.668
but I got the sense
from the call with him

21:58.710 --> 22:01.372
that things did not
end well between you.

22:01.420 --> 22:02.842
They didn't.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.939
And that's obviously
why he's lying.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.810
BELL: Mr. Wolf, we spoke
with the contractor

22:06.850 --> 22:08.488
who built this studio,

22:08.520 --> 22:10.954
and he confirmed Darren Azoff
did the drywall.

22:10.990 --> 22:11.979
And the hallway you
just walked us through,

22:12.030 --> 22:13.793
with all your
gold records,

22:13.830 --> 22:16.458
there's a pretty prominent
empty guitar hook

22:16.500 --> 22:17.865
hanging on the wall.

22:17.900 --> 22:18.924
How old are you, kid?

22:18.970 --> 22:20.460
Excuse me?

22:20.500 --> 22:22.536
I've been dealing
with scarier people

22:22.570 --> 22:24.106
since before
you were born.

22:24.140 --> 22:26.461
And I got
good lavwers.

22:26.510 --> 22:28.375
Why you trying to intimidate me?

22:32.750 --> 22:34.115
took Frances from me,

22:34.150 --> 22:37.483
That still doesn't
tie me to the murder.

22:37.520 --> 22:39.613
And no court will
ever punish me...

22:39.650 --> 22:40.958
(gunshot, Azoff screams
on recording)

22:40.990 --> 22:42.389
GUNMAN:
This thing I'm doing

22:42.420 --> 22:44.524
is called a "six-pack."

22:44.560 --> 22:45.959
Elbows, knees,

22:45.990 --> 22:47.150
ankles.

22:47.190 --> 22:48.953
When I run out of those,

22:49.000 --> 22:50.399
I'll improvise.

22:50.430 --> 22:51.988
AZOFF:
Please!

22:52.030 --> 22:53.019
This is a mistake!

22:53.070 --> 22:54.628
You got the wrong guy!

22:54.670 --> 22:56.035
GUNMAN:
No.

22:56.070 --> 22:58.004
We know you took her.

22:58.040 --> 23:00.406
You're keeping her somewhere.

23:00.440 --> 23:03.739
And the gentleman you took her
from would like her back.

23:03.780 --> 23:06.544
(two gunshots)

23:06.580 --> 23:07.774
(button clicks, recording stops)

23:07.820 --> 23:09.117
(through intercom):
It's got a good beat.

23:09.150 --> 23:11.084
I think the jury's
gonna dance to it.

23:11.120 --> 23:13.588
Mr. Wolf, you want us to
prove you were the last one

23:13.620 --> 23:15.611
to own Frances?
No problem.

23:15.660 --> 23:16.888
You had her,

23:16.920 --> 23:18.126
Darren Azoff
took her,

23:18.160 --> 23:20.424
and then he died
an agonizing death.

23:20.460 --> 23:22.428
The people are gonna
want someone to pay.

23:22.460 --> 23:23.893
Wouldn't you rather
it be someone else?

23:23.930 --> 23:25.568
Okay, let's say,

23:25.600 --> 23:27.739
hypothetically,
I hired someone

23:27.770 --> 23:30.136
to find Lady Frances.

23:30.170 --> 23:32.104
Not to kill anyone.

23:32.140 --> 23:34.631
What kind of maniac
is gonna do that?

23:34.680 --> 23:35.908
BELL:
Hypothetically?

23:37.550 --> 23:39.438
I'm sure the DA.
would be very grateful.

23:41.050 --> 23:43.211
So where's the guitar now?
My guy hasn't

23:43.250 --> 23:44.615
been able to find it.

23:44.650 --> 23:46.140
Wait, are you saying that

23:46.190 --> 23:48.181
he didn't take it
from Azoff's house?

23:48.220 --> 23:49.881
Wasn't there when he got there.

23:53.160 --> 23:56.948
It could take me... a while

23:57.000 --> 23:59.093
to get ahold of him.

23:59.130 --> 24:03.169
(through intercom):
Well, let's hope you reach him
before he kills again.

24:03.200 --> 24:07.000
COSMO:
She is a beauty, isn't she?

24:07.040 --> 24:09.201
*

24:09.240 --> 24:11.174
Look, I-I get why you're mad.

24:11.210 --> 24:13.246
But just see it from
where I'm standing.

24:13.280 --> 24:16.078
I-I wasn't planning
on stealing her.

24:16.120 --> 24:18.680
The shots came in...

24:18.720 --> 24:23.009
and I heard the shooter
say "the Lady Frances."

24:23.060 --> 24:24.857
I knew what it was.

24:24.890 --> 24:27.222
Poor guy who got shot, he said
the address where they had it,

24:27.260 --> 24:29.091
and I saw on the screen
where they were--

24:29.130 --> 24:30.768
I was a lot closer.

24:30.800 --> 24:32.620
So I just deleted
the part of the audio

24:32.670 --> 24:35.594
where they said the address
and then I got to her first.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.767
Look at her.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.061
She's worth millions.

24:44.010 --> 24:46.808
I wasn't planning on selling
her, but we could.

24:46.850 --> 24:48.147
And w-we could split it.

24:48.180 --> 24:49.249
What do you think?

24:51.650 --> 24:54.016
(grunting)

24:56.960 --> 24:57.949
(guitar cracks)

25:03.230 --> 25:05.118
SLESSINGER: The good people
of New York will sleep easier

25:05.170 --> 25:07.991
in their beds tonight,
knowing that Darren Azoff's

25:08.040 --> 25:09.928
vicious assassin has been caught
thanks to BulletPoint...

25:09.970 --> 25:11.528
(knocks on glass)

25:11.570 --> 25:13.709
...a program the mayor
and the police department

25:13.740 --> 25:14.877
have fought at every turn.

25:14.910 --> 25:17.105
Whereas, if I am elected mayor,

25:17.140 --> 25:19.005
I will keep pushing
for programs just...

25:19.050 --> 25:20.574
Clearly your request that
the councilman tone down

25:20.620 --> 25:22.178
his rhetoric fell
on deaf ears.

25:22.220 --> 25:24.780
Doesn't bode well for his
relationship with the force

25:24.820 --> 25:25.844
if he's elected.

25:25.890 --> 25:27.983
Guys like him come and go.

25:28.020 --> 25:28.850
We'll just keep
doing our jobs.

25:28.890 --> 25:30.778
Speaking of,

25:30.830 --> 25:32.559
that vicious assassin

25:32.590 --> 25:34.899
Slessinger's taking
credit for catching,

25:34.930 --> 25:36.818
they're setting him
up in Interview One.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.060
GREGSON:
Reese Vennek?

25:46.110 --> 25:47.930
I'm Captain Gregson,
this is Ms. Watson,

25:47.980 --> 25:49.834
Mr. Holmes.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.939
I assume you've already
gathered that Herman Wolf

25:51.980 --> 25:53.914
gave you up for the
murder of Darren Azoff.

25:53.950 --> 25:55.941
I had a sense.

25:55.980 --> 25:58.016
Well, what you
might not know

25:58.050 --> 26:02.157
is that we've also matched
your prints to a partial

26:02.190 --> 26:05.921
that we lifted off a
shell casing at the scene.

26:05.960 --> 26:08.019
And we have an audio recording
of everything you said and did.

26:08.060 --> 26:09.925
Yeah, right.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.825
You explained "six-packing"
to Azoff

26:11.870 --> 26:13.167
as you were shooting him.

26:14.970 --> 26:16.767
It's a long story, you'll have
plenty of time to hear it.

26:16.800 --> 26:19.337
GREGSON: Our point is, you
don't say another word in here,

26:19.370 --> 26:21.873
that's fine,
we have everything we need.

26:21.910 --> 26:23.946
You're going away
for a long time.

26:23.980 --> 26:28.076
Still, the DA. always
prefers confessions,

26:28.120 --> 26:29.678
and you do have
some leverage

26:29.720 --> 26:31.085
to make things
go easier.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.156
Such as?

26:34.190 --> 26:37.751
We know you had an accomplice,
we'll want his name.

26:37.790 --> 26:40.156
We'll also want to know
what you did with Azoff's body.

26:44.230 --> 26:48.064
This obviously isn't your first
professional work, Mr. Vennek.

26:48.100 --> 26:49.931
Would I be right in thinking
that your incarceration

26:49.970 --> 26:51.699
might worry some of
your previous employers?

26:51.740 --> 26:53.002
So now would be

26:53.040 --> 26:54.337
a very good time to think about

26:54.380 --> 26:55.802
avoiding general population.

27:09.390 --> 27:13.690
My helper's name was D'Agostino.

27:13.730 --> 27:15.823
Mr. Azoff...

27:15.860 --> 27:18.658
is at the bottom
of Jamaica Bay.

27:18.700 --> 27:21.032
I bleached down his truck

27:21.070 --> 27:25.131
and had it dismantled
at a chop shop.

27:25.170 --> 27:26.728
I'll give you
their address, too.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.846
It's just business.

27:30.880 --> 27:33.713
Didn't sound like it
when you were killing Azoff.

27:33.750 --> 27:35.149
Hmm.

27:35.180 --> 27:36.374
Some customers

27:36.420 --> 27:38.047
ask you to go easy,

27:38.090 --> 27:41.218
others want you to make it hard.

27:41.260 --> 27:44.229
So Wolf did instruct you
to kill Azoff?

27:44.260 --> 27:47.024
With expletives. Why?

27:47.060 --> 27:49.699
What'd he say?

27:49.730 --> 27:51.994
That he only hired you
to bring back the Lady Frances.

27:52.030 --> 27:54.169
(soft chuckle)
That's funny.

27:54.200 --> 27:55.394
Seeing as how my rsum

27:55.440 --> 27:56.862
doesn't include
much in the way of

27:56.900 --> 27:58.834
guitar retrieval.

27:58.870 --> 28:04.274
I'll be sure to include
Mr. Wolfs exact wording.

28:04.310 --> 28:07.074
I want to be
clear, though.

28:07.110 --> 28:09.146
I'm only confessing
to the murder

28:09.180 --> 28:10.317
of Azoff.

28:10.350 --> 28:11.908
The second man
was dead

28:11.950 --> 28:13.087
when I got there.

28:13.120 --> 28:15.054
What second man?

28:15.090 --> 28:17.081
(indistinct radio chatter)

28:18.260 --> 28:20.285
Cosmo Dellis.

28:20.330 --> 28:23.049
This is the tech at BulletPoint
who first heard the shooting.

28:23.100 --> 28:24.920
How the hell did
he get the guitar?

28:24.970 --> 28:26.096
We didn't hear all
the audio that he heard.

28:26.130 --> 28:27.324
WATSON:
Wolf's hit man,

28:27.370 --> 28:29.099
Vennek, told
us that Azoff

28:29.140 --> 28:31.961
gave him the location of
the guitar before he died.

28:32.010 --> 28:33.261
That wasn't on the audio
that we all heard.

28:33.310 --> 28:34.937
So Cosmo must have
deleted that part

28:34.980 --> 28:36.333
before sending
it to the police,

28:36.380 --> 28:39.099
then he stole the guitar
before Vennek could get to it.

28:39.150 --> 28:40.845
Okay.

28:40.880 --> 28:42.768
Then how did Vennek get here?

28:42.820 --> 28:44.139
He reached out
to mu5ic stores

28:44.190 --> 28:46.215
and guitar
enthusiasts.

28:46.250 --> 28:49.185
Cosmo bought an authentic
case for a '57 Desperado

28:49.220 --> 28:50.778
from a vintage
guﬂarshop.

28:50.830 --> 28:52.081
So word got
back to Vennek.

28:52.130 --> 28:54.155
But Vennek claimed by
the time he got here,

28:54.200 --> 28:56.794
Cosmo was dead and the
Lady Frances was gone.

28:56.830 --> 28:59.060
So who else knew
that Cosmo had the guitar?

28:59.100 --> 29:00.328
We could start by
visiting the shop

29:00.370 --> 29:02.167
where Cosmo
bought the case.

29:02.200 --> 29:03.906
It's where Vennek
found out he had it;

29:03.940 --> 29:05.168
maybe someone
else did, too.

29:05.210 --> 29:06.734
CSU TECH:
Found something.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.410
Well, I don't think a trip
to the guitar shop's

29:15.450 --> 29:17.213
going to be be necessary.

29:17.250 --> 29:22.051
This is part of the pick guard
of a 1957 Carfax Desperado.

29:22.090 --> 29:23.250
_ So unless two
million-dollar gUItars

29:23.290 --> 29:25.053
found their way
into Cosmo's orbit,

29:25.090 --> 29:27.081
we're looking at what's left
of the Lady Frances.

29:27.130 --> 29:29.223
Killer was smart
enough to clean up,

29:29.260 --> 29:31.125
but they missed this bit.

29:31.170 --> 29:32.990
That's blood.

29:33.030 --> 29:35.089
You don't think the guitar
was the murder weapon?

29:35.140 --> 29:36.266
I do.

29:37.500 --> 29:39.206
Short of being set
afire on stage,

29:39.240 --> 29:40.901
he's died the most rock-and-roll
death imaginable.

29:40.940 --> 29:42.976
But if the killer
destroyed the Lady Frances

29:43.010 --> 29:44.898
by killing Cosmo
with her...

29:44.950 --> 29:46.247
Then he obviously didn't
kill him for it.

29:46.280 --> 29:48.441
Then why?

29:52.150 --> 29:53.515
Oh, don't bother setting up,
I'm not gonna stay.

29:55.360 --> 29:56.588
I need to ask you
a couple of questions.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.827
Let me guess.

29:58.860 --> 30:01.328
You and the doc didn't let
the drive-by go like I asked.

30:01.360 --> 30:02.327
We did not.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.560
And?

30:07.600 --> 30:09.261
Well, ballistics
matched the weapon

30:09.300 --> 30:10.961
to the same one used to kill
a friend of yours 12 years ago.

30:11.010 --> 30:12.307
Jameel Clark.

30:12.340 --> 30:14.103
What?

30:14.140 --> 30:16.176
Detective Guzman,
he didn't want to tell you.

30:16.210 --> 30:18.440
He thought you might tip
to the culprit's identity

30:18.480 --> 30:19.606
and go after him yourself.

30:19.650 --> 30:21.277
Now, I've decided to risk it.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.276
Can you point us
in anyone's direction?

30:23.320 --> 30:25.447
No, I got nothing.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.958
Apparently, you and Jameel
were quite close.

30:27.990 --> 30:30.151
Did you share
an enemy back then?

30:30.190 --> 30:32.021
'Cause that might be
the person we're looking for.

30:32.060 --> 30:33.152
He killed Jameel in 2005.

30:33.190 --> 30:35.852
He wanted to kill you as well,
but you went to prison.

30:35.900 --> 30:39.165
Now that you're out, he's just
picking up where he left off.

30:39.200 --> 30:42.067
A few weeks before
Jameel got shot,

30:42.100 --> 30:46.207
we went down to Atlantic City,
met up with some dudes he knew.

30:46.240 --> 30:47.537
The first night we
needed some money,

30:47.570 --> 30:49.003
so we held up a liquor store.

30:49.040 --> 30:50.632
The owner killed
one of the dudes,

30:50.680 --> 30:52.341
and that dude's brother

30:52.380 --> 30:53.472
blamed me and Jameel,

30:53.510 --> 30:55.319
said he was gonna kill us,

30:55.350 --> 30:57.170
so we got our asses
out of there.

30:57.220 --> 30:59.313
We came home and we didn't think
nothing else of it.

30:59.350 --> 31:01.910
And then Jameel got killed.

31:04.230 --> 31:06.255
What?
Nothing.

31:06.290 --> 31:08.224
So, the man who
threatened you--

31:08.260 --> 31:10.592
I mean, surely you considered
him a suspect when Jameel died.

31:10.630 --> 31:14.589
Thought crossed my mind,
but I didn't get his name.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.267
I didn't think
he got ours, either.

31:16.300 --> 31:17.961
I mean, me and
Jameel was in SBK,

31:18.010 --> 31:20.069
I figured what happened
was because of that.

31:20.110 --> 31:22.476
A rival banger got his address

31:22.510 --> 31:23.579
and that was that.

31:23.610 --> 31:25.271
And you're quite certain

31:25.310 --> 31:27.346
you can't identify the person
from Atlantic City?

31:27.380 --> 31:28.574
No. Sorry.

31:30.120 --> 31:32.384
You paid for the time?

31:32.420 --> 31:34.354
Yeah, I did.

31:34.390 --> 31:35.414
If you're not gonna use it,

31:35.460 --> 31:37.189
I'm-a find somebody who will.

31:37.220 --> 31:38.653
Tell the doc I said hi.

31:42.300 --> 31:44.325
You think I killed Cosmo?

31:44.370 --> 31:47.396
Right now we just want to know
where you were last night.

31:47.430 --> 31:50.297
Home with my husband all night.

31:52.670 --> 31:53.637
No.

31:53.670 --> 31:56.230
Why are you asking?

31:56.280 --> 31:59.204
Well, right now BulletPoint
is just a pilot program.

31:59.250 --> 32:00.979
We spoke to the mayor's office
and found out

32:01.020 --> 32:02.339
that you've got some
stiff competition.

32:02.380 --> 32:05.383
They're also looking
at a company called ShotSpotter,

32:05.420 --> 32:08.116
and there are other similar
technologies out there as well.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.048
BELL: Whoever wins
the contract to go citywide

32:10.090 --> 32:12.729
will make
about $30 million a year.

32:12.760 --> 32:16.355
It's a lot of motive _to make an
embarrassmg Situation go away.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.265
Like when one of your techs
exploits the system

32:18.300 --> 32:21.565
to steal a $5 million guitar.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.465
Will you come with me?

32:28.440 --> 32:31.147
Dave, these people are
from the police department.

32:31.180 --> 32:33.444
I'm gonna show them
what we found.

32:35.350 --> 32:37.341
So, what are we looking at?

32:37.380 --> 32:39.086
Evidence of fraud.

32:39.120 --> 32:40.280
When Cosmo didn't
show up today,

32:40.320 --> 32:42.515
I had another tech
cover his station.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.357
She found that
he had installed

32:44.390 --> 32:46.381
editing software
on his computer.

32:46.430 --> 32:50.389
Our techs aren't allowed to put
anything on their computers.

32:50.430 --> 32:51.226
That's what
he must've used

32:51.270 --> 32:53.124
to delete parts
of Azoff's shooting.

32:53.170 --> 32:54.432
MAKRIS:
The thing is

32:56.500 --> 32:58.764
It had been on
there for months,

32:58.810 --> 33:01.074
and he didn't use it
to just delete things.

33:01.110 --> 33:02.134
What do you mean?

33:02.180 --> 33:03.431
We've been digging

33:03.480 --> 33:04.504
into what he was
doing all day,

33:04.550 --> 33:07.599
and it turns out that he
was creating fake inCIdents.

33:07.650 --> 33:11.040
He was splicing prerecorded
gunshots into the feed

33:11.090 --> 33:12.614
in order to make it look like
they triggered the system.

33:12.650 --> 33:16.359
He was sending the police
on wild goose chases.

33:16.390 --> 33:18.255
You're saying all
these incidents

33:18.290 --> 33:20.781
are reports of shots fired
that the cops went out on

33:20.830 --> 33:22.457
that never happened?

33:22.500 --> 33:24.195
MAKRIS:
Yeah.

33:24.230 --> 33:26.369
It's all in the report.

33:26.400 --> 33:28.459
I'm mortified.

33:28.500 --> 33:30.661
This is addressed
to the deputy commissioner

33:30.700 --> 33:32.338
for Information Technology.

33:32.370 --> 33:34.179
That's the bureau in charge
of the contract, right?

33:34.210 --> 33:35.768
MAKRIS: We were just sending
that over when you got here.

33:37.240 --> 33:40.243
I know it's gonna kill the bid,
but I was a cop.

33:40.280 --> 33:41.747
I'm doing the right thing.

33:41.780 --> 33:45.341
Why would I kill Cosmo to
cover up that he stole a guitar,

33:45.390 --> 33:49.508
and then turn around and admit
to an even worse scandal?

33:49.560 --> 33:52.256
You're right.
You wouldn't.

33:52.290 --> 33:53.655
_But I have_
a bigger question.

33:53.690 --> 33:55.658
Why would he add those gunshots?

33:55.700 --> 33:56.689
Why would anyone?

34:04.470 --> 34:06.461
(gunshots)

34:09.540 --> 34:11.542
(gunshots continue)

34:16.350 --> 34:18.443
Could you turn that off, please?

34:18.490 --> 34:20.811
Oh, good. You're up.
(gunshots stop)

34:20.850 --> 34:23.216
Oh. I take it those
are the gunshots

34:23.260 --> 34:26.354
that Cosmo edited into
BulletPoint's feed.

34:26.390 --> 34:27.755
Gunshot, actually. Singular.

34:27.790 --> 34:30.793
The recording that
Cosmo used for his deceit,

34:30.830 --> 34:32.821
I noticed that it was,
in fact, a single recording

34:32.870 --> 34:35.839
of a single gunshot fired
from a .45 caliber pistol.

34:35.870 --> 34:37.758
He just copied it
over and over again.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.404
Spread out amongst
the actual gunshots

34:39.440 --> 34:40.634
that BulletPoint captured,

34:40.670 --> 34:41.830
the preponderance
of a single caliber

34:41.880 --> 34:43.233
didn't raise any eyebrows.

34:43.280 --> 34:45.407
Okay, does that
help us understand

34:45.450 --> 34:47.839
why he created fake incidents
or who killed him?

34:47.880 --> 34:49.211
No, not in the slightest.

34:49.250 --> 34:50.274
It's just a detail
that I observed

34:50.320 --> 34:51.548
while I was up
all night working

34:51.590 --> 34:53.387
and thinking
about another matter.

34:53.420 --> 34:54.819
What is it?

34:54.860 --> 34:56.259
Well, there's been a development

34:56.290 --> 34:57.712
in Shinwell's near-shooting.

34:57.760 --> 34:59.421
Like what?

34:59.460 --> 35:01.257
Like I've identified
a culprit.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.551
That's great.
Did you tell Guzman?

35:02.600 --> 35:04.261
No, not yet.

35:04.300 --> 35:05.767
Before I involve the police--
or you, even--

35:05.800 --> 35:08.633
I want to be sure
of a few things.

35:08.670 --> 35:10.763
Whatever you need.
Yeah.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.700
My audio-ballistics
analysis aside,

35:12.740 --> 35:15.573
I did solve
Cosmo Dellis' murder.

35:15.610 --> 35:18.579
It's all in there
and up there.

35:18.610 --> 35:19.872
You'll have to meet
Marcus and the captain

35:19.910 --> 35:21.309
at the precinct without me,
however.

35:21.350 --> 35:24.444
They're expecting
the killer in an hour.

35:28.620 --> 35:30.281
Appreciate you coming to see us

35:30.320 --> 35:32.151
instead of the other way around,
Councilman.

35:32.190 --> 35:34.397
I know it's
a busy time for you.

35:34.430 --> 35:37.319
Please. You're helping me out
by keeping me in the loop.

35:37.360 --> 35:38.497
GREGSON: This is
Detective Marcus Bell,

35:38.530 --> 35:40.293
our consultant, Joan Watson.

35:40.330 --> 35:43.333
They've been working
the Azoff case from the start.

35:43.370 --> 35:44.837
SLESSINGER:
Is that it?

35:44.870 --> 35:47.168
The famous guitar I've been
hearing so much about?

35:47.210 --> 35:51.271
No, but it is a '57 Desperado,
same model and year.

35:51.310 --> 35:53.449
But you already knew
that wasn't the Lady Frances

35:53.480 --> 35:55.311
because you destroyed it

35:55.350 --> 35:57.215
when you used it
to kill Cosmo Dellis.

35:57.250 --> 35:59.389
Excuse me?

35:59.420 --> 36:01.217
Is this a joke?

36:01.260 --> 36:02.750
Captain, I get you're sore

36:02.790 --> 36:04.326
about me throwing haymakers
at the department, but...

36:04.360 --> 36:06.248
What makes me sore,
Councilman,

36:06.290 --> 36:08.326
is elected officials
committing fraud,

36:08.360 --> 36:10.419
and then trying
to cover it up with murder.

36:10.460 --> 36:13.429
BELL:
For months, Cosmo Dellis

36:13.470 --> 36:15.529
had been creating fake
gunfire incidents,

36:15.570 --> 36:18.403
which BulletPoint would
then report to the police.

36:18.440 --> 36:19.907
The incidents
would be investigated,

36:19.940 --> 36:22.602
but ultimately they'd
be classified unsolved.

36:22.640 --> 36:26.201
At first, we could not figure
out why someone would do this,

36:26.250 --> 36:28.218
but then my partner
discovered a pattern.

36:28.250 --> 36:29.877
See, those dots are

36:29.920 --> 36:32.582
all fake gunshot reports
that Cosmo created.

36:32.620 --> 36:35.748
They're also all inside the two
crime-ravaged neighborhoods

36:35.790 --> 36:38.281
that you've specifically been
campaigning to clean up.

36:38.330 --> 36:40.286
BELL:
We also confirmed that

36:40.330 --> 36:42.753
you knew Cosmo, you did
since he was a little kid.

36:42.800 --> 36:45.496
His father's one of your
biggest contributors.

36:45.530 --> 36:47.521
So, you placed
Cosmo at BulletPoint

36:47.570 --> 36:49.299
to do your hacking
and audio editing,

36:49.340 --> 36:51.900
so that when the NYPD's

36:51.940 --> 36:53.862
unreported gun violence
stats come out,

36:53.910 --> 36:56.470
those two neighborhoods would
look like the Wild West.

36:56.510 --> 36:58.375
WATSON: Suddenly,
your law and order campaign

36:58.410 --> 37:02.517
seems much more urgent
and then the votes roll in.

37:02.550 --> 37:04.518
So, it's not just fraud and
murder you're accusing me of.

37:05.590 --> 37:07.649
I'm also rigging the election?

37:07.690 --> 37:11.251
We think your initial interest
in Darren Azoff's murder

37:11.290 --> 37:13.383
was purely political,

37:13.430 --> 37:16.024
but_ then it turned out he was
killed over a stolen gwtar,

37:16.060 --> 37:18.028
and you knew that Cosmo
had caught the incident,

37:18.060 --> 37:21.564
and you knew
he was a guitar nut.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.363
You put two
and two together.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.004
BELL: You also knew that
there was a manhunt underway

37:25.040 --> 37:28.999
to find whoever had the
guitar before a hit man did.

37:29.040 --> 37:30.871
You couldn't let Cosmo live
to enter police custody

37:30.910 --> 37:34.004
because he could give you
up as leverage in a deal.

37:34.050 --> 37:35.574
So, you went to his place.

37:35.620 --> 37:37.576
You got rid of him
and the Lady Frances

37:37.620 --> 37:39.588
at the same time.

37:39.620 --> 37:42.919
Well, I hope this little fiction
of yours keeps you warm

37:42.960 --> 37:45.588
when I'm mayor and
you're all out on your asses.

37:45.630 --> 37:48.554
Do you mind showing us
your hands, Councilman?

37:48.600 --> 37:50.693
What?

37:50.730 --> 37:52.891
Cosmo's wasn't the only blood
we found at the scene.

37:52.930 --> 37:55.490
We figured, someone
beats a guy to death

37:55.540 --> 37:58.964
with an electric guitar,
they're gonna cut their hands.

38:07.710 --> 38:09.519
GREGSON:
Councilman Slessinger,

38:09.550 --> 38:11.518
this is a warrant for your DNA.

38:19.860 --> 38:22.693
I told you I got
nothing to say to you.
So shut up and listen.

38:22.730 --> 38:24.664
You'd probably lie, anyway.

38:24.700 --> 38:26.793
I've been lied to
quite enough of late.

38:26.830 --> 38:28.491
So, after you and I talked,

38:28.540 --> 38:30.531
I asked Shinwell what he and
your brother might have done

38:30.570 --> 38:32.538
to inspire someone
to want to kill them both.

38:32.570 --> 38:34.538
And he told me this story
about a man who was killed

38:34.580 --> 38:37.401
robbing a liquor store,
about how that man's sibling

38:37.440 --> 38:39.499
then came gunning for the
fellow robbers who he blamed.

38:39.550 --> 38:41.415
I don't know anything
about that.

38:41.450 --> 38:42.712
Well, I believe that you don't,
but the problem is

38:42.750 --> 38:45.412
I know about it.
Now, all of those details

38:45.450 --> 38:47.543
were borrowed from an incident
which took place in 2012.

38:47.590 --> 38:49.353
It made the headlines because

38:49.390 --> 38:50.414
both the liquor store owner
and the surviving robber

38:50.460 --> 38:52.519
were both charged with murder
at the same time.

38:52.560 --> 38:54.892
Now, I believe that
Shinwell knew about it

38:54.930 --> 38:57.125
because he and the robber,
they were inmates together

38:57.160 --> 38:58.661
at Great Meadow.

38:58.700 --> 38:59.724
I-I spent the best
part of last night

38:59.770 --> 39:01.499
trying to work out
why Shinwell wouldn't want me

39:01.540 --> 39:03.531
to identify the person
that tried to kill him.

39:03.570 --> 39:04.468
But then I remembered.

39:04.510 --> 39:05.568
You withheld information
from me, as well.

39:05.610 --> 39:08.135
So, what does that prove?
Doesn't prove anything,

39:08.170 --> 39:09.774
but it did cause me to revisit
Shinwell's description

39:09.810 --> 39:11.801
of the car driven
by the person who shot at him.

39:11.850 --> 39:15.809
It was a Chew, about
ten years old, green.

39:15.850 --> 39:20.685
Your sister has a 2006
Chevy Aveo, aqua green.

39:20.720 --> 39:22.915
You have access
to it. I checked.

39:22.960 --> 39:26.452
I was wrong, looking
for one person

39:26.490 --> 39:27.821
who shot at both your
brother and Shinwell.

39:29.000 --> 39:29.989
You shot at Shinwell

39:30.030 --> 39:31.827
'cause 12 years ago,

39:31.870 --> 39:33.497
he murdered your brother.

39:34.770 --> 39:35.759
Tell me I'm wrong.
