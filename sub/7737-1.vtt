I'll figure something else out.

on a delivery this afternoon.

it was a gas leak.

who might not be here?

have been brought in.

- You weren't on the guest list.

but he went anyway.

your friend after the party.

they'll bring him home

26:23.349 --> 26:24.951

catching up.

Any idea why he'd go there
in the first place?

26:27.787 --> 26:30.790
- I don't know.
He didn't tell me anything.

that you managed

from us for so long.

I'm with the resistance?

31:58.884 --> 32:02.754
- Because our hosts
are tired of the insurgency.

32:02.788 --> 32:06.892
They've blown six IEDs
in the last month alone.

32:06.993 --> 32:10.029
They're getting bolder,
more dangerous.

32:10.062 --> 32:12.898
You and I, we both know
that guys like yourself,

32:12.999 --> 32:14.766
guys with your training,

32:14.800 --> 32:18.437
you're a, uh,
rare breed these days.

32:18.470 --> 32:23.275
And that makes you
especially valuable.

32:23.309 --> 32:24.876
- You want me to collaborate.

32:24.910 --> 32:29.548
- I want to give you
your old job back, my man.

32:29.581 --> 32:31.050
That is, head up
Special Task Force,

32:31.083 --> 32:34.286
infiltrate the insurgency,
and bring us their leader.

32:34.320 --> 32:38.024
This character
they call "Geronimo."

32:40.492 --> 32:44.663
- Sorry to interrupt, Alan,
but it looks like it's starting.

32:47.433 --> 32:49.835
- You're gonna want to see this.

33:03.382 --> 33:06.352
[ominous music]

33:06.385 --> 33:12.358
*

33:12.391 --> 33:15.161
All right, here we go,
everybody.

33:15.194 --> 33:20.666

33:20.699 --> 33:24.270
[rumbling]

33:30.609 --> 33:31.577
[boom]

33:31.610 --> 33:34.680
[gasping]

33:34.713 --> 33:37.416
[distant explosion]

33:39.618 --> 33:41.920
It's breathtaking, isn't it?

33:41.953 --> 33:44.090
They put on that show
a couple times a month.

33:44.123 --> 33:45.924
- Yeah, I've seen it
from my house.

33:45.957 --> 33:47.726
- Not like this.

33:47.759 --> 33:50.129
I thought it might give you
some perspective.

33:53.099 --> 33:57.136
The most important day in
human history is coming, Will.

34:02.508 --> 34:06.545
I just want you and your family
to be on the right side of it.

34:08.180 --> 34:11.517
- And when I tell you
to piss off?

34:11.550 --> 34:13.819
- Why don't you give us
a minute, sweetie?

34:16.822 --> 34:19.358
You have committed crimes
that must be punished

34:19.391 --> 34:22.528
in accordance
with occupational law.

34:22.561 --> 34:27.199
If you can't help me, then you
and your wife and your children,

34:27.233 --> 34:31.370
well, I'm sorry but you'll
all be sent to The Factory.

34:35.907 --> 34:39.478
- How do you do it, Snyder?

34:39.511 --> 34:43.315
Slap on a suit and smile
and dick over your own kind?

34:43.349 --> 34:45.184
- I'm doing what anybody
with a brain would do

34:45.217 --> 34:48.387
in this situation.

34:48.420 --> 34:52.191
I'm taking advantage
of my opportunities.

35:22.621 --> 35:25.824
[tense music]

35:25.857 --> 35:28.260
[screeching tires]

35:28.294 --> 35:29.495
- Maddie, go get Hudson.

35:29.528 --> 35:30.629
- Who is it?
- Right now, right now.

35:30.662 --> 35:31.997
We're leaving.

35:32.030 --> 35:33.432
Bram, Bram, Bram,
Bram, Bram, wake up.

35:33.465 --> 35:34.500
- What? Mom, what?
- Wake up, wake up.

35:34.533 --> 35:35.801
Go get your sister.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.203
We're leaving.
We're leaving.

35:37.203 --> 35:40.206
Gracie!
Up and at 'em, sweet girl!

35:55.387 --> 35:55.654
.

35:55.687 --> 35:57.022
- [exhales sharply]

36:00.892 --> 36:02.761
- I'm sorry.

36:02.794 --> 36:04.696
I'm sorry.

36:04.730 --> 36:06.698
Okay.
I'm okay.

36:06.732 --> 36:08.234
- Daddy!
- Hey, baby.

36:08.234 --> 36:10.269
Come here.

36:10.302 --> 36:11.737
[chuckles]

36:11.770 --> 36:14.740
Oh!

36:14.773 --> 36:16.074
Hey.

36:16.107 --> 36:17.609
What's everybody
doing up so late?

36:17.643 --> 36:19.878
- God, Will.
We were so worried.

36:19.911 --> 36:22.281
- I'm okay.
Here.

36:22.314 --> 36:26.452
Take this big girl.

36:26.485 --> 36:28.454
- Where were you?

36:28.487 --> 36:31.623
- I was out on a delivery,
had a little fender bender.

36:31.657 --> 36:34.260
Got stuck out after curfew.

36:34.260 --> 36:35.727
Homeland picked me up.

36:35.761 --> 36:37.128
No matter what I said or did,

36:37.162 --> 36:40.766
they wouldn't let me
make a phone call.

36:40.799 --> 36:44.303
Just released me now.

36:44.336 --> 36:46.338
I'm sorry.

36:48.774 --> 36:51.277
Come on!
It's okay, I'm home.

36:51.310 --> 36:53.144
I didn't mean to worry you.
It's all right.

36:53.178 --> 36:55.180
No problem.

37:07.293 --> 37:09.027
Ah.

37:37.789 --> 37:40.225
- [grunting]

37:40.326 --> 37:43.329
[both panting]

37:53.639 --> 37:56.642
[crying]

38:16.227 --> 38:19.230
[giggles]

38:38.917 --> 38:41.052
So they know?

38:41.086 --> 38:44.756
We're not the Sullivans.

38:53.565 --> 38:56.101
- What do you want to hear?

38:58.870 --> 39:01.707
- I want to hear the truth.

39:09.848 --> 39:13.318
- You've got all the answers.

39:13.419 --> 39:15.687
You tell me.

39:18.289 --> 39:21.660
- Do you know how scared I was?

39:21.693 --> 39:23.995
How we all were?

39:24.029 --> 39:26.264
I called in some favors and
they said you'd been picked up

39:26.297 --> 39:29.835
trying to leave the block.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.870
- I went after Charlie.

39:34.139 --> 39:35.106
- No.

39:35.140 --> 39:38.109
- This thing is a cancer.

39:38.143 --> 39:40.145
It's bad enough he's gone,

39:40.178 --> 39:42.981
but to see you every day
hating me for it.

39:43.014 --> 39:44.783
- I don't hate you for it.

39:44.816 --> 39:47.719
- I should have picked him up.

39:50.522 --> 39:53.625
He's my son too.

39:53.659 --> 39:56.361
- I know.

39:56.462 --> 39:58.163
I know, I know, I know.

39:58.196 --> 40:01.567
Baby.
Shh, shh, shhh.

40:02.901 --> 40:07.372
Love, we have
two other children.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.040
- I know.

40:09.074 --> 40:12.611
- And you know what they do
to the families of criminals.

40:15.213 --> 40:17.916
- You don't have to worry
about that.

40:21.587 --> 40:23.889
Proxy Snyder offered me a job.

40:26.592 --> 40:28.594
- To work for him?

40:31.930 --> 40:34.265
What does he want you to do?

40:39.571 --> 40:43.208
- He wants me to hunt down
the resistance.

40:43.241 --> 40:44.743
- To collaborate?

40:44.776 --> 40:47.245
- I saw a dozen people murdered
the other day,

40:47.278 --> 40:50.248
and so the resistance
can accomplish what?

40:50.281 --> 40:51.717
Do they even know
who their enemy is?

40:51.750 --> 40:54.886
- Love, you sound like them
right now.

40:54.920 --> 40:57.856
- I'm trying to do something

40:57.889 --> 41:00.425
to help us, to...

41:00.458 --> 41:03.529
- If you do it, you're putting
a target on your back

41:03.529 --> 41:06.431
and on mine
and on those children.

41:06.532 --> 41:08.199
As far as the resistance
is concerned,

41:08.233 --> 41:09.668
collaborate and you die.

41:09.701 --> 41:11.803
- I'm not sending our kids
to a labor camp!

41:11.837 --> 41:16.274
- Well, thank God
you've got it all figured out.

41:16.307 --> 41:17.275
- Well, what would you do?

41:17.308 --> 41:18.644
[door slams]

41:25.016 --> 41:28.353
[quiet clanging]

41:28.386 --> 41:30.321
Hey.

41:30.355 --> 41:33.458
- Yeah?

41:33.559 --> 41:36.562
Is that bacon?

41:38.229 --> 41:40.198
[sizzling food, rustling]

41:40.231 --> 41:42.701
- Snyder?

41:42.734 --> 41:44.369
- Good morning.

41:44.402 --> 41:45.904
Hungry?

41:49.174 --> 41:51.677
It's Katie, right?

41:51.710 --> 41:53.044
- Right.

41:53.078 --> 41:55.647
- Proxy Alan Snyder,
Los Angeles block.

41:55.681 --> 41:57.148
- What are you doing
in my house?

41:57.182 --> 41:59.585
- Cooking breakfast.

41:59.585 --> 42:01.687
I also made some coffee.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.789
One of the little luxuries
we took for granted

42:03.822 --> 42:05.791
before our current situation.

42:05.824 --> 42:06.892
- Mommy?

42:06.925 --> 42:08.393
- Oh, man, is that bacon?

42:08.426 --> 42:10.095
- It is.
Let me guess.

42:10.128 --> 42:12.998
Bram and Grace?

42:17.002 --> 42:18.303
- Yeah.
Aren't you--

42:18.336 --> 42:20.105
- Proxy Snyder.

42:20.138 --> 42:21.306
- Bram, take Grace upstairs.

42:21.339 --> 42:23.975
- Wait, wait.

42:24.009 --> 42:26.277
Don't leave without breakfast.

42:28.980 --> 42:31.249
- [exhales]

42:31.282 --> 42:33.819
Move, Grace.
Come on.

42:39.524 --> 42:42.928
- This is a big moment
for your family.

42:42.961 --> 42:44.796
You're going to have
access to things

42:44.830 --> 42:47.332
that were previously
unavailable.

42:47.365 --> 42:51.502
For instance, your children
will be assigned private tutors.

42:51.536 --> 42:53.338
You'll also be afforded
certain other luxuries,

42:53.371 --> 42:56.341
round-the-clock security
from Homeland among them.

42:56.374 --> 42:58.644
- Which we'd need
as collaborators.

42:58.644 --> 43:00.779
- Look.
I know it might not seem it,

43:00.812 --> 43:04.049
but our hosts are here
for our benefit.

43:04.082 --> 43:05.751
- Come out there
with me, Snyder.

43:05.784 --> 43:07.686
Not the Green Zone, the flats.

43:07.719 --> 43:09.054
Let me show you a few things

43:09.087 --> 43:10.656
and then tell me
if you still believe that.

43:10.656 --> 43:12.190
- There need to be
some controls in place,

43:12.223 --> 43:14.092
otherwise it'd be anarchy.

43:14.125 --> 43:17.929
But all of this,
it's temporary.

43:17.963 --> 43:22.433
Once they've satisfied
their needs, they'll leave.

43:22.467 --> 43:25.737
Everything will go back
to normal.

43:25.771 --> 43:27.773
- What needs?

43:32.678 --> 43:37.115
- I wanted this to be
more of a surprise, but, um...

43:37.148 --> 43:41.687
Your bar?
The Yo Napa--

43:41.687 --> 43:44.289
- Yonka Patofa.
We called it the Yonk.

43:44.322 --> 43:46.692
- The Yonk.
I like that.

43:46.692 --> 43:48.459
So I've convinced our hosts

43:48.493 --> 43:51.129
that they've undervalued
recreation a bit.

43:51.162 --> 43:53.899
They've agreed
to reopening some places.

43:53.932 --> 43:58.003
We'd like The Yonk to be among
the first.

43:59.705 --> 44:01.139
- Hm.

44:01.172 --> 44:02.708
- Only thing is,

44:02.741 --> 44:05.276
I'm going to need an answer
before I leave.

44:13.418 --> 44:16.054
- You want my help?

44:20.225 --> 44:22.527
We want our son back.

44:26.732 --> 44:27.866
We were separated
during the invasion.

44:27.899 --> 44:30.235
He's in the Santa Monica block.

44:33.739 --> 44:38.209
- Good things come to the loyal.

44:38.243 --> 44:41.246
We help them, they help us.

44:41.279 --> 44:45.751
You help me, I help you.

45:12.143 --> 45:14.212
- Got to go.

45:18.183 --> 45:21.686
[huffs]

45:21.787 --> 45:24.022
Where have you been hiding that?

45:24.055 --> 45:27.458
- Special occasion.

45:27.492 --> 45:29.494
- [chuckles]

45:29.527 --> 45:32.964
- To new jobs.

45:32.998 --> 45:34.900
- To old jobs.

45:40.571 --> 45:42.673
Mm.

45:42.707 --> 45:44.810
Ohh.

45:53.418 --> 45:55.420
- I'm with you.

46:04.162 --> 46:06.631
- I got to go to work.

46:06.664 --> 46:09.935
- Hey.
Hey.

46:09.968 --> 46:12.337
Come here.

46:26.017 --> 46:27.085
Be safe.

46:27.118 --> 46:29.420
- You bet.

46:29.454 --> 46:31.489
- Okay.

46:31.522 --> 46:32.490
- Don't finish it.

46:32.523 --> 46:34.525
- Just might.

46:46.872 --> 46:49.875
[mechanical buzzing]

47:05.590 --> 47:08.059
[bicycle clicks]

47:18.136 --> 47:20.605
- Hi, Grandma.

47:20.638 --> 47:22.107
I'm here for breakfast.

47:22.140 --> 47:23.208
- You're a bit early.

47:23.241 --> 47:25.243
- I came hungry.

47:27.979 --> 47:30.615
[chimes ringing]

47:30.648 --> 47:32.650
- Come with me.

47:39.124 --> 47:43.128
Oh, put your bag down there.

47:43.161 --> 47:44.996
Thank you.

47:48.166 --> 47:49.600
It's okay.

47:52.270 --> 47:55.806
[knocking]
Here we are.

47:55.840 --> 47:58.009
And there you go.

48:26.571 --> 48:28.439
- Go ahead.
Tell them.

48:34.545 --> 48:38.016
- You have someone
on the inside.

48:38.049 --> 48:40.051
- Who?

48:43.588 --> 48:47.192
- Me.

48:47.225 --> 48:50.395
- How's that?

48:50.428 --> 48:54.032
- The occupation just hired
my husband to hunt us down.

48:54.065 --> 48:57.035
[dramatic music]

48:57.068 --> 49:05.143
