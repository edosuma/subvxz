00:04.800 --> 00:07.394
(police radio chatter)

00:28.220 --> 00:30.450
(sound muted)

00:32.500 --> 00:36.266
(soft ambient pulse)

01:17.140 --> 01:19.108
(Sound returns.)

01:19.140 --> 01:21.131
(siren in the distance)

01:24.150 --> 01:26.118
(sound muted)

01:26.150 --> 01:28.141
(soft ambient pulse)

01:35.390 --> 01:37.358
(Sound returns.)

01:37.390 --> 01:39.790
(insects chirping)

01:45.930 --> 01:48.364
(house alarm)

01:52.540 --> 01:54.508
- I shoot Mr. Marlow twice,

01:54.540 --> 01:57.748
severing jugulars and carotids
with near-surgical precision.

01:57.780 --> 02:01.272
He will die watching me take
what is his away from him.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.185
This is my design.

02:03.220 --> 02:06.849
(house alarm)
(woman whimpering frantically)

02:19.970 --> 02:23.235
I shoot Mrs. Marlow expertly
through the neck.

02:23.270 --> 02:26.330
This is not a fatal wound.
The bullet misses every artery.

02:26.380 --> 02:29.872
She is paralyzed
before it leaves her body.

02:29.910 --> 02:34.313
Which doesn't mean
she can't feel pain.

02:34.350 --> 02:36.318
It just means

02:36.350 --> 02:39.649
she can't do anything about it.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.922
This is my design.

02:46.730 --> 02:49.267
(house alarm)

02:49.300 --> 02:51.268
(Alarm stops.)

02:51.300 --> 02:54.929
(phone ringing on other end)
(keypad beeps)

02:54.970 --> 02:58.269
- [This is DDX Security.
Who am I speaking with?]

03:01.010 --> 03:04.275
- I need the incident report
for the home security company.

03:10.890 --> 03:13.358
This was recorded
as a false alarm.

03:17.330 --> 03:20.754
There was a false alarm
last... week.

03:23.530 --> 03:25.498
He tapped their phone.

03:25.530 --> 03:28.738
- Yeah. It's been tapped.

03:28.770 --> 03:31.739
- He recorded
M_rs. Marlow's conversation
With the security company.

03:31.770 --> 03:35.934
- This is DDX Security.
Who am I speaking with?
- Theresa Marlow.

03:35.980 --> 03:39.245
- Can you please confirm your
password for security purposes?

03:39.280 --> 03:42.340
- Tea kettle.

03:42.390 --> 03:45.609
- Thank you, Mrs. Marlow.
We detected a front-door alarm.

03:45.650 --> 03:47.857
- Yeah, sorry about that.

03:47.890 --> 03:52.259
- Is there anyone in the house
with you at this time,
Mrs. Marlow?

03:52.300 --> 03:55.622
- I'm just here with my
husband._
- Do you reqUIre

03:55.660 --> 03:59.221
any further assistance?
- No. Thank you so much
for calling.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.003
- And this is when it gets
truly horrifying

04:05.040 --> 04:06.632
for Mrs. Marlow.

04:12.420 --> 04:15.275
Everyone has thought
about killing someone,

04:15.320 --> 04:16.947
one way or another,

04:16.990 --> 04:21.916
be it your own hand
or the hand of God.

04:21.960 --> 04:26.351
Now think about killing
Mrs. Marlow.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.892
Why did she deserve this?

04:30.930 --> 04:32.898
Tell me your design.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.829
Tell me who you are.

04:42.410 --> 04:44.344
- Mr. Graham.

04:44.380 --> 04:46.610
Special Agent

04:46.650 --> 04:49.016
Jack Crawford. I head
the Behavioral Science Unit.

04:49.050 --> 04:51.018
- We've met.
- Yes.

04:51.050 --> 04:53.883
We had a disagreement
when we opened up the museum.

04:53.920 --> 04:56.684
- I disagreed with what
you named it.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.686
- The, uh, Evil Minds
Research Museum.

04:58.730 --> 05:00.595
- It's a little hammy, Jack.

05:00.630 --> 05:03.667
- I see you've hitched

05:03.700 --> 05:05.463
your horse to a teaching post,

05:05.500 --> 05:08.560
and I also understand it's
difficult for you to be social.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.568
- Well, I'm just
talking at them.

05:10.610 --> 05:14.068
I'm not listening to them.
It's not social.
- I see.

05:14.110 --> 05:17.773
May I?

05:20.050 --> 05:21.574
Where do you fall

05:21.620 --> 05:23.747
on the spectrum?

05:23.790 --> 05:26.611
- My horse is hitched
to a post

05:26.660 --> 05:29.823
that is closer
to Asperger's
and autistics

05:29.860 --> 05:32.078
than narcissists
and sooopaths.

05:32.130 --> 05:36.123
- But you can empathize
with narcissists

05:36.160 --> 05:38.424
and sociopaths.
- I can empathize with anybody.

05:38.470 --> 05:40.938
_ It's less to do_
With a personality disorder

05:40.970 --> 05:43.063
than an active imagination.
- Um...

05:43.110 --> 05:46.375
can I...

05:46.410 --> 05:48.537
borrow your imagination?

05:48.580 --> 05:50.548
Eight girls

05:50.580 --> 05:52.844
abducted from eight different
Minnesota campuses,

05:52.880 --> 05:55.110
all in the last eight months.
- I thought there were seven.

05:55.150 --> 05:58.381
- There were.
- When did you tag the eighth?

05:58.420 --> 06:02.424
- About three minutes before
I walked into your lecture hall.

06:05.660 --> 06:08.720
- No bodies, no parts of bodies,
nothing that comes out
of bodies. Nothing.

06:08.760 --> 06:11.729
- Then those girls weren't taken
from where you think
they were taken.

06:11.770 --> 06:13.738
- Then where were
they taken from?

06:13.770 --> 06:15.738
- I don't know. Someplace else.

06:15.770 --> 06:18.000
- All of them abducted
on a Friday

06:18.040 --> 06:20.406
so they wouldn't have to be
reported missing until Monday.

06:20.440 --> 06:24.649
Now, however he's covering
his tracks, he needs
a weekend to do it.

06:27.550 --> 06:28.972
- Number eight?

06:29.020 --> 06:31.818
- Elise Nichols. St. Cloud State
on the Mississippi.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.011
Disappeared on Friday.
Was supposed to house sit

06:34.060 --> 06:36.779
for her parents
over the weekend, feed the cat.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.457
She never made it home.

06:38.490 --> 06:40.424
- Yeah, one through seven are
dead, don't you think?

06:40.460 --> 06:42.860
He's not keeping them around.
He got himself

06:42.900 --> 06:45.926
a new one. _
- So we focus on Elise Nichols.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.769
- They're all very, um...
Mall of America.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.930
That's a lot
of wind-chafed skin.

06:55.980 --> 06:57.948
- Same hair colour,
same eye colour.

06:57.980 --> 07:01.643
Roughly the same age.
Same height, same weight.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.443
So what is it
about all of these girls?

07:03.490 --> 07:07.654
- It's not about
all of these girls.
It's just about one of them.

07:07.690 --> 07:11.649
He's like Willy Wonka.
Every girl he takes is
a candy bar,

07:11.690 --> 07:16.969
and hidden in amongst
all of those candy bars is
the one true intended victim,

07:17.000 --> 07:19.059
which, if we follow through
on our metaphor,

07:19.100 --> 07:22.604
is your golden ticket.
- So, is he

07:22.640 --> 07:24.198
warming up
for his golden ticket,

07:24.240 --> 07:26.674
or just reliving whatever it is
he did to her?

07:26.710 --> 07:29.599
- The golden ticket wouldn't be
the first taken, and she
wouldn't be the last.

07:29.650 --> 07:34.519
He would, um, hide how special
she was. I mean, I would.
Wouldn't you?

07:34.550 --> 07:36.108
- I want you to get closer
to this.

07:36.150 --> 07:39.187
- No. You have Heimlich at
Harvard and Bloom at Georgetown.

07:39.220 --> 07:42.621
They do the same thing I do.
- That's not exactly true,
is it?

07:42.660 --> 07:44.719
You have a very specific way
of thinking about things.

07:44.760 --> 07:48.958
- Has there been
a lot of discussion
about the, uh, specrﬁc way

07:49.000 --> 07:51.867
I think?
- You make jumps
you can't explain, Will.

07:51.900 --> 07:54.562
- No, no.
The evidence explains.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.807
- Then help me find
some evidence.

08:00.710 --> 08:03.474
- That may require me
to be sociable.

08:15.060 --> 08:17.881
- (echoing voice): She could've
gone off by herself.

08:17.930 --> 08:22.560
She... she was a very interior
young woman.

08:24.570 --> 08:26.765
She didn't like living
in her dorm.

08:26.800 --> 08:30.031
I could see how the pressure
of school might have

08:30.070 --> 08:31.662
gotten to her.

08:31.710 --> 08:34.702
She likes trains.

08:34.740 --> 08:37.573
Maybe she just got
on a train and...

08:37.610 --> 08:39.544
- She looks
like the other girls.

08:39.580 --> 08:42.686
- Yes, she fits
the profile.

08:44.720 --> 08:47.188
- Could Elise still be alive?

08:51.760 --> 08:53.899
- We simply have no way
of knowing.

08:53.930 --> 08:57.821
- How's the cat?
- (Mrs. Nichols): What?

09:00.170 --> 09:01.660
- How's your cat?

09:01.700 --> 09:03.736
E-Elise was supposed
to feed it.

09:03.770 --> 09:06.034
Was the cat weird
when you came home?

09:06.070 --> 09:08.937
It must've been hungry.
It didn't eat all weekend.

09:08.980 --> 09:11.847
- I... I didn't notice.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.808
- Could you give us a moment,
please?

09:28.100 --> 09:31.297
- (whispering): He took her
from here.

09:33.670 --> 09:36.195
She got on a train,
she came home,

09:38.240 --> 09:40.231
He took her.

09:44.410 --> 09:46.970
- The Ni_chols' house is
a crIme scene.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.772
I need ERT immediately.

09:48.820 --> 09:52.085
I want Zeller, Katz,
and Jimmy Price.

09:52.120 --> 09:54.088
Yes, and a photographer.

09:54.120 --> 09:57.283
- Why is it now a crime scene?

09:57.330 --> 09:59.696
- Can I see
your daughter's room?

10:12.270 --> 10:14.636
- I'll get that.

10:14.680 --> 10:17.308
Mr. Nichols, please put
your hands in your pockets

10:17.350 --> 10:19.818
and avoid touching anything.

10:19.850 --> 10:21.818
- But we've been
in and out of here

10:21.850 --> 10:23.818
all day.

10:23.850 --> 10:27.149
- You can hold the cat,
if it's easier.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.094
- Elise.
- I need you to leave

10:39.130 --> 10:40.859
the room.

10:53.450 --> 10:55.771
- You take your time.

10:55.820 --> 10:57.788
When you're ready to talk,
you talk.

10:57.820 --> 11:01.187
If you don't feel like it,
you don't talk.

11:01.220 --> 11:03.188
We'll be downstairs.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.790
You let me know when you're
ready for us to come in.

11:19.740 --> 11:22.868
(siren)

11:31.420 --> 11:39.384
(soft ambient pulse)

12:12.190 --> 12:15.455
- You're Will Graham.
- You're not supposed
to be in here.

12:15.500 --> 12:20.767
- You wrote the standard
monograph on time of death
by insect activity.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.360
I found antler velvet
in two of the wounds.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.469
You, uh, not real FBI?

12:25.510 --> 12:28.274
- I'm a special investigator.

12:28.310 --> 12:31.006
- Never been an FBI agent?

12:31.050 --> 12:33.041
- Um... strict

12:33.080 --> 12:36.140
screening procedures.
- Detects instability...

12:36.180 --> 12:38.887
You unstable?

12:38.920 --> 12:41.286
- Now, you know you're not
supposed to be in here.

12:41.320 --> 12:44.551
- I found antler velvet
in two of the wounds,
like she was gored.

12:44.590 --> 12:46.558
I was looking for velvet
in the other wounds

12:46.590 --> 12:49.320
but I was interrupted.
- Hold on, excuse me. Look,

12:49.360 --> 12:52.261
deer and elk pin their prey, OK?
They put all their weight
into their antlers,

12:52.300 --> 12:55.064
try and suffocate a victim.
That's how they would kill,
like, a fox or a coyote.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.034
- All right, Elise Nichols was
strangled, suffocated,

12:57.070 --> 12:59.800
her ribs are broken.
- Antler velvet is rich

12:59.840 --> 13:03.139
in nutrients. It actually
promotes healing. He may have
put it in there on purpose.

13:03.180 --> 13:05.375
- You think he was trying
to heal her?

13:05.410 --> 13:09.312
- He wanted to undo
as much as he could--

13:09.350 --> 13:11.580
given that he'd
already killed her.

13:11.620 --> 13:13.986
- He put her back
where he found her.

13:14.020 --> 13:17.183
- Whatever he did to the others,
he couldn't do it to her.

13:17.230 --> 13:20.154
- (Jack): Is this
his golden ticket?

13:22.900 --> 13:25.323
- No.

13:25.370 --> 13:27.361
This is an apology.

13:31.640 --> 13:34.200
Does anyone have any aspirin?

13:48.360 --> 13:50.385
Hello.

13:52.530 --> 13:55.226
Hey.

13:55.260 --> 14:00.197
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Come on. Come on.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.948
Hey.

14:16.990 --> 14:19.550
Hey, come here.

14:19.590 --> 14:21.182
Hey.

14:38.340 --> 14:42.071
Winston, this is everybody.

14:42.110 --> 14:44.305
Everybody, this is Winston.

14:44.350 --> 14:46.545
(barkin
Tss! ngs)!

14:49.050 --> 14:51.018
That's right.

15:04.300 --> 15:09.192
(heartbeat)

15:11.210 --> 15:15.203
(heartbeat)

15:23.050 --> 15:26.178
(heartbeat)

16:16.170 --> 16:19.139
- What are you doing in here?

16:19.170 --> 16:21.138
- I enjoy the smell
of urinal cake.

16:21.180 --> 16:22.670
- Me too. We need to talk.

16:22.710 --> 16:25.440
USE THE LADIES' ROOM!

16:30.750 --> 16:33.116
You respect my judgment, Will?

16:33.160 --> 16:35.378
- Mm-hmm. Yes.

16:35.420 --> 16:40.050
- Good, because we will stand
a better chance of catching
this guy with you

16:40.100 --> 16:42.694
in the saddle.
- Yeah, I'm in the saddle.

16:42.730 --> 16:47.099
I'm just, um, confused
which direction I'm pointing.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.597
I don't know

16:49.640 --> 16:52.108
this kind of psychopath.
I've never read about him.

16:52.140 --> 16:55.268
_ I don't even know
If he's a psychopath. He's not
insensitive. He's not shallow.

16:55.310 --> 17:00.418
- You know something about him;
otherwise, you wouldn't have
said, "This is an apology".

17:00.450 --> 17:03.578
What is he apologizing for?
- He couldn't honour her.
He feels bad.

17:03.620 --> 17:05.485
- Well, feeling bad defeats
the purpose of being

17:05.520 --> 17:07.385
a psychopath, doesn't it?
- Yes! It does.

17:07.420 --> 17:10.014
- Then what kind
of crazy is he?!

17:12.090 --> 17:15.719
- He couldn't
show her he loved her,
so he put her corpse back

17:15.760 --> 17:17.728
where he killed it.
Whatever crazy that is.

17:17.770 --> 17:20.159
- You think he loves
these girls?

17:20.200 --> 17:22.668
- He loves one of them.
A-And, yes, I think

17:22.700 --> 17:25.737
by association he has some form
of love for the others.

17:25.770 --> 17:29.604
- There was no semen, there was
no saliva. Elise Nichols died
a Virgin.

17:29.640 --> 17:31.642
She stayed that way.
- That's not how

17:31.680 --> 17:34.114
he's loving them. He wouldn't
disrespect them that way!

17:34.150 --> 17:36.118
He doesn't want these girls
to suffer.

17:36.150 --> 17:39.415
He kills them quickly and...

17:39.450 --> 17:43.489
to his thinking, with mercy.

17:46.230 --> 17:48.790
- Sensitive psychopath.

17:48.830 --> 17:51.560
Risked getting caught

17:54.570 --> 17:58.233
- He has to take the next girl
soon".

17:58.270 --> 18:02.138
'cause he knows he's gonna
get caught.

18:02.180 --> 18:04.740
One way or the other.

18:21.360 --> 18:22.759
- I got you.

18:44.820 --> 18:47.311
- (Jack): Graham likes you.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.329
Doesn't think you'll run
any mind games on him.

18:50.360 --> 18:54.194
- I don't. I'm as honest
with him as I'd be
with a patient.

18:54.230 --> 18:56.198
- You've been observing him
while you've been

18:56.230 --> 18:58.460
guest-lecturing here
at the academy, yes?

18:58.500 --> 19:00.832
- I've never been in_ a room
alone wrth WIll.

19:00.870 --> 19:04.431
- Why not?
- Because I want
to be his friend, and I am.

19:04.470 --> 19:08.270
- Ah, it seems a shame
not to take advantage--
academically speaking.

19:08.310 --> 19:10.574
- You already asked me
to do a study on him,

19:10.610 --> 19:13.170
Jack. I said no.
And anything

19:13.220 --> 19:16.940
scholarly on Will Graham would
have to be published
posthumously.

19:16.980 --> 19:20.211
- So, you've never been alone
with him because you have
a professional

19:20.260 --> 19:23.423
curiosity.
(Jack chuckles.)

19:23.460 --> 19:25.678
- Normally I wouldn't
even broach this,

19:25.730 --> 19:30.429
but what do you think one
of Will's strongest drives is?

19:30.470 --> 19:32.620
- Fear.

19:32.670 --> 19:35.195
- Mm-hmm.
- Will Graham deals

19:35.240 --> 19:38.562
with huge amounts of fear.
It comes with his imagination.

19:38.610 --> 19:40.601
- It's the price of imagination.

19:40.640 --> 19:45.304
- Alana, I wouldn't put him
out there if I didn't think
I could cover him.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.568
All right, if I didn't think
I could cover him 80%.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.769
- I wouldn't put him out there.

19:48.820 --> 19:51.448
- He's out there.
I need him out there.

19:51.490 --> 19:54.812
Should he get too close, I need
you to make sure he's not
out there alone.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.755
Promise me something, Jack.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.528
Don't let him get too close.

20:04.570 --> 20:06.925
- He won't... get too close.

20:12.370 --> 20:14.838
- (sighing): OK.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.804
Tried her skin for prints--
of course nothing.

20:17.850 --> 20:20.944
We did get a hand
spread off her neck.
- Report say anything

20:20.980 --> 20:23.949
_ ab_out nails?
- FIngernalls were smudged
when we took the scrapings.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.641
The scrapings were
from her own palms

20:26.690 --> 20:28.658
when she scratched them.
She never scratched him.

20:28.690 --> 20:30.851
- Piece of metal is all we got.
- We should be looking

20:30.890 --> 20:32.881
at plumbers, steamfitters,
tool workers...

20:59.620 --> 21:02.783
- Other injuries were probably
but not conclusively
post-mortem.

21:02.820 --> 21:06.620
So... not gored.
- She has lots of piercings
that look like they were caused

21:06.660 --> 21:10.596
by deer antlers. I didn't say
the deer was responsible
for putting them there.

21:10.630 --> 21:12.325
- She was mounted on them.

21:12.370 --> 21:14.930
Like hooks.

21:14.970 --> 21:19.339
She may have been bled.
- Her liver was removed.

21:19.370 --> 21:21.634
See that? He took it out,
and then...

21:21.680 --> 21:24.046
yep, he put it back in.
- Huh.

21:24.080 --> 21:26.776
Why would he cut it out
if he's just gonna sew it

21:26.810 --> 21:28.368
back in again?

21:28.420 --> 21:30.741
- There was something wrong
with the meat.

21:32.550 --> 21:34.313
- She has liver cancer.

21:37.730 --> 21:40.324
- He's, um... he's eating them.

21:42.860 --> 21:47.866
**
(JS Bach: Goldberg
Variations: "Aria")

22:24.570 --> 22:27.778
(crying)
- Please.

22:34.080 --> 22:36.071
Thank you.

22:40.190 --> 22:43.489
I hate being this neurotic.
- If you weren't neurotic,

22:43.530 --> 22:47.057
Franklyn, you would be something
much worse.

22:54.200 --> 22:57.909
Our brain is designed
to experience anxiety
in short bursts,

22:57.940 --> 23:01.637
not the prolonged duress
yours has seemed to enjoy.

23:01.680 --> 23:05.172
That's why you feel as though
a lion were on the verge
of devouring you.

23:05.210 --> 23:08.077
(crying)

23:08.120 --> 23:10.441
Franklyn.
- Yes.

23:10.490 --> 23:13.550
- You have to convince yourself
the lion is not in the room.

23:13.590 --> 23:15.558
When it is,

23:15.590 --> 23:18.024
I assure you,

23:18.060 --> 23:19.857
you will know.

23:24.770 --> 23:27.568
- Dr. Lecter.
I'm, uh, Special Ag--

23:27.600 --> 23:30.569
- I hate to be discourteous,
but this is a private exit
for my patients.

23:30.610 --> 23:35.206
- Oh, Dr. Lecter.
Sorry. Um,

23:35.240 --> 23:37.105
I'm, uh, Special Agent

23:37.140 --> 23:39.938
Jack Crawford, FBI.
May I come in?

23:39.980 --> 23:41.948
- You may wait
in the waiting room.

23:41.980 --> 23:43.948
Franklyn, I'll see you
next week.

23:43.990 --> 23:46.140
- Yes.
- Unless, of course,

23:46.190 --> 23:47.714
this is about him.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.012
- No, this is all about you.

23:58.600 --> 24:00.830
- Please, come in.

24:04.240 --> 24:05.798
So,

24:05.840 --> 24:08.104
may I ask how this is
all about me?

24:08.140 --> 24:10.779
- You can ask,
but I may have to ask you

24:10.810 --> 24:13.540
a few questions first.

24:13.580 --> 24:15.639
You expecting another patient?

24:15.680 --> 24:17.170
- We're all alone.

24:17.220 --> 24:19.882
- Oh, good.

24:19.920 --> 24:22.252
No secretary?
- Was predispositioned

24:22.290 --> 24:25.748
to romantic whims.
Followed her heart
to the United Kingdom.

24:25.790 --> 24:28.554
(Jack chuckles.)
Sad to see her go.

24:31.900 --> 24:33.629
- Wow.

24:37.670 --> 24:40.138
Are these yours, Doctor?
- Among the first.

24:40.170 --> 24:42.832
My boarding school in Paris
when I was a boy.

24:42.880 --> 24:45.041
- The amount of detail is
incredible.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.877
- I learned very early

24:46.910 --> 24:49.743
a scalpel cuts better points
than a pencil sharpener.

24:49.780 --> 24:52.510
- Well, now I understand
why your drawings earned you

24:52.550 --> 24:54.609
an internship
at Johns Hopkins.

24:56.220 --> 24:58.780
- I'm beginning to suspect
you're investigating me,

24:58.830 --> 25:02.618
Agent Crawford.
- (chuckling): No, no.

25:02.660 --> 25:05.720
No, you were referred to me
by Alana Bloom

25:05.770 --> 25:09.069
in the psychology department--
Georgetown.

25:09.100 --> 25:12.069
- Most psychology departments
are filled with personality

25:12.110 --> 25:15.534
deficients. Dr. Bloom would be
the exception.

25:15.580 --> 25:17.775
- Yes, she would.
Yes, she would.

25:17.810 --> 25:21.746
Well, she told me
that you mentored her during
her residency at Johns Hopkins.

25:21.780 --> 25:23.919
- I learned as much from her
as she did from me.

25:23.950 --> 25:26.009
- Yes, but she also showed me,
uh, your paper,

25:26.050 --> 25:27.950
"Evolutionary..." uh,

25:27.990 --> 25:30.208
"Evolutionary Origins
of Social Exclusion"?

25:30.260 --> 25:31.818
- Yes.

25:31.860 --> 25:33.999
- Very interesting.
Very interesting.

25:34.030 --> 25:35.622
Even for a layman.

25:35.660 --> 25:37.924
- A layman?
- Yeah.

25:37.970 --> 25:41.098
- So many learned fellows
going about in the halls
of Behavioral Science

25:41.140 --> 25:45.167
at the FBI, and you
consider yourself a layman.
- I do when I'm in your company,

25:45.210 --> 25:47.974
doctor. Um,

25:48.010 --> 25:51.707
I need you to help me
with a psychological profile.

25:54.820 --> 25:57.175
- (Lecter): Tell me, then,
how many confessions?

25:57.220 --> 25:59.745
- Twelve dozen, the last time
I checked. None of them had

25:59.790 --> 26:02.111
any details--
until this morning.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.628
And then
they all had details.

26:04.660 --> 26:07.959
Some genius in Duluth PD
took a photograph of
Elise Nichols' body

26:08.000 --> 26:10.298
with his cell phone,
shared it with his friends,

26:10.330 --> 26:11.797
and then Freddy Lounds

26:11.830 --> 26:14.162
posted it
on Tattlecrime.com.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.736
- Tasteless.

26:15.770 --> 26:19.206
- (Lecter): Do you have
trouble with taste?

26:19.240 --> 26:21.800
- My thoughts are often
not tasty.

26:21.840 --> 26:24.343
- Nor mine.

26:24.380 --> 26:26.871
No effective barriers.
- I build forts.

26:26.910 --> 26:30.141
- Associations come quickly.
- So do forts.

26:34.290 --> 26:36.611
- Not fond of eye contact,
are you?

26:36.660 --> 26:38.628
- Eyes are distracting--

26:38.660 --> 26:41.094
you see too much,
you don't see enough.

26:41.130 --> 26:44.668
And-And it's hard to focus
when you're thinking, um,

26:44.700 --> 26:46.895
"Oh, those whites are
really white",

26:46.930 --> 26:50.058
or, "He must have hepatitis":
or, "Oh, is that a burst

26:50.100 --> 26:53.729
vein?" So, yeah,

26:53.780 --> 26:55.998
I try to avoid eyes
whenever possible.

26:56.040 --> 26:58.349
Jack?
- Yes?

26:58.380 --> 27:00.405
- I imagine what you see
and learn touches

27:00.450 --> 27:02.418
everything else
in your mind.

27:02.450 --> 27:04.418
Your values and decency are
present

27:04.450 --> 27:06.839
yet shocked
at your associations,

27:06.890 --> 27:10.018
appalled at your dreams.

27:10.060 --> 27:13.279
No forts in the bone _arena
of your skull for things
youlove.

27:13.330 --> 27:16.857
- Whose profile
are you working on?

27:16.900 --> 27:19.221
Whose profile
is he working on?

27:19.270 --> 27:22.330
- I'm sorry, Will.
Observing is what we do.

27:22.370 --> 27:24.736
I can't shut mine off any more
than you can shut yours off.

27:24.770 --> 27:27.705
- Please,
don't psychoanalyze me.

27:27.740 --> 27:30.231
You won't like me
when I'm psychoanalyzed.

27:30.280 --> 27:32.168
_ - Will.
- Now, If you'll excuse me,

27:32.210 --> 27:35.748
I have to go give a lecture
on psychoanalyzing.

27:38.750 --> 27:40.718
- Maybe we shouldn't poke him
like that,

27:40.760 --> 27:44.958
Doctor. Perhaps a less,
uh, direct approach.

27:44.990 --> 27:48.426
- What he has is
pure empathy.

27:48.460 --> 27:50.769
He can assume
your pomt of View,

27:50.800 --> 27:52.893
or mine, and maybe some other
points of view that scare him.

27:52.930 --> 27:57.435
It's an uncomfortable gift,
Jack.

27:57.470 --> 28:01.179
Perception's a tool
that's pointed on both ends.

28:01.210 --> 28:06.705
This cannibal you have him
getting to know...

28:06.750 --> 28:09.344
Ithink I can help
good Will see his face.

28:14.190 --> 28:16.750
(cawing)

28:30.770 --> 28:34.206
- (Jack): Stag head was reported
stolen last night, about a mile
from here.

28:34.240 --> 28:35.832
- Just the head?

28:35.880 --> 28:37.939
- Minneapolis Homicide's
already made a statement.

28:37.980 --> 28:40.141
They're calling him
the Minnesota Shrike.

28:40.180 --> 28:41.738
- Like the bird?

28:41.780 --> 28:45.887
- Shrike's a perching bird.
Impales mice

28:45.920 --> 28:48.480
and lizards on thorny branches
and barbed wire.

28:48.520 --> 28:51.227
Rips their organs
right out of their bodies,

28:51.260 --> 28:54.229
puts them in a little birdie
pantry, and eats them later.

28:54.260 --> 28:56.353
- I can't tell
whether it's sloppy

28:56.400 --> 28:58.868
or shrewd.
- He wanted her found

28:58.900 --> 29:00.936
this way.

29:00.970 --> 29:02.267
It's...

29:02.300 --> 29:05.303
it's petulant.

29:05.340 --> 29:08.207
I almost feel
like he's mocking her.

29:08.240 --> 29:11.107
Or... he's mocking us.

29:13.380 --> 29:15.871
- Where did all his love go?

29:15.920 --> 29:20.482
- Whoever tucked Elise Nichols
into bed didn't paint
this picture.

29:20.520 --> 29:24.456
- He took her lungs.

29:24.490 --> 29:26.981
I'm pretty sure she was alive
when he cut 'em out.

29:42.440 --> 29:45.341
- Our cannibal loves women.

29:45.380 --> 29:48.349
He doesn't want to destroy them;
he wants to consume them,

29:48.380 --> 29:51.213
to keep some part
of them inside.

29:51.250 --> 29:53.309
This girl's killer thought
that she was a pig.

29:53.350 --> 29:56.956
- You think this was a copycat?
- The cannibal

29:56.990 --> 29:58.958
who killed Elise Nichols had
a place to do it

29:58.990 --> 30:02.596
and no interest in...
in field kabuki. So,

30:02.630 --> 30:05.360
he has a house, or two,
or a-a cabin--

30:05.400 --> 30:07.937
something
with an antler room.

30:14.480 --> 30:17.847
He has a daughter.

30:17.880 --> 30:21.270
The same age as the other girls.
Same-same hair colour,

30:21.320 --> 30:23.311
same eye colour, same height,
same weight.

30:26.190 --> 30:29.512
She's an only child.
She's leaving home.

30:31.530 --> 30:34.522
He can't stand the thought
of losing her.

30:36.530 --> 30:38.566
She's his golden ticket.

30:38.600 --> 30:41.569
- What about the copycat?

30:41.600 --> 30:43.636
- You know,
an intelligent psychopath,

30:43.670 --> 30:46.503
particularly a sadist,
is very hard to catch.

30:46.540 --> 30:48.508
There's no traceable motive,
there'll be no patterns.

30:48.540 --> 30:50.531
He may never kill
this way again.

30:50.580 --> 30:52.605
Have Dr. Lecter draw up
a psychological profile.

30:52.650 --> 30:55.448
You seemed very impressed
with his opinion.

31:37.620 --> 31:39.622
(knocking on door)

31:41.630 --> 31:43.598
(blankets shuffling)

31:43.630 --> 31:45.621
(footsteps)

31:48.600 --> 31:52.309
- Good morning, Will.
May I come in?

31:52.340 --> 31:55.400
- Where's Crawford?
- Deposed in court.

31:55.440 --> 31:59.149
The adventure will be yours
and mine today.

31:59.180 --> 32:00.909
May I come in?

32:09.520 --> 32:12.455
I'm very careful
about what I put into my body,

32:12.490 --> 32:15.618
which means I end up
preparing most meals myself.

32:15.660 --> 32:19.528
A little protein scramble
to start the day.

32:19.570 --> 32:22.562
Some eggs, some sausage.

32:29.040 --> 32:30.598
- Mm, it's delicious.

32:30.640 --> 32:33.245
Thank you.
- My pleasure.

32:36.320 --> 32:39.209
I would apologize
for my analytical ambush,

32:39.250 --> 32:41.753
but I know_ I_ will soon be
apologizmg again

32:41.790 --> 32:44.224
and you'll tire of that
eventually,

32:44.260 --> 32:47.479
_so I have to consider
usmg apologies sparingly.
- Just keep it professional.

32:47.530 --> 32:52.069
- Or we could socialize,
like adults.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.068
God forbid we become friendly.

32:54.100 --> 32:56.432
- I don't find you
that interesting.

32:56.470 --> 32:58.529
- You will.

33:05.450 --> 33:08.442
Agent Crawford tells me you have
a knack for the monsters.

33:10.450 --> 33:13.248
- I don't think the Shrike
killed that girl

33:13.290 --> 33:14.689
in the field.

33:17.590 --> 33:19.751
- The devil is in the details.

33:19.790 --> 33:23.123
What didn't your copycat do
to the girl in the field?
What gave it away?

33:23.160 --> 33:25.367
- Everything.

33:25.400 --> 33:32.033
It's like he had to show me
a negative so that I could
see the positive. It...

33:32.070 --> 33:34.436
That crime_scene was
practically gift-wrapped.

33:34.480 --> 33:37.506
- The mathematics
of human behaviour--

33:37.540 --> 33:39.508
all those ugly variables.

33:39.550 --> 33:44.283
Some bad math
with this Shrike fellow, huh?

33:44.320 --> 33:47.289
Are you reconstructing
his fantasies?

33:47.320 --> 33:49.288
- Heh.
- What kind of problems

33:49.320 --> 33:51.322
does he have?
- Uh, he has a few.

33:53.690 --> 33:56.625
- You ever have any problems,
Will?

33:56.660 --> 33:58.662
- No.

33:58.700 --> 34:00.429
- Of course you don't.

34:00.470 --> 34:02.688
You and I are just alike--

34:02.740 --> 34:04.708
problem-free. Nothing about us

34:04.740 --> 34:07.766
to feel horrible about.

34:09.780 --> 34:12.749
You know, Will...

34:12.780 --> 34:16.238
I think Uncle Jack sees you
as a fragile little teacup.

34:16.280 --> 34:20.387
The finest china,
used for only special guests.

34:20.420 --> 34:24.322
(Will laughing)

34:26.790 --> 34:28.690
- How do you see me?

34:33.170 --> 34:37.163
- The mongoose
I want under the house
when the snakes slither by.

34:40.810 --> 34:42.801
Finish your breakfast.

34:49.480 --> 34:52.085
- (Will): What are you
smiling at?

34:54.320 --> 34:56.811
- Peeking behind the curtain.

34:56.860 --> 35:01.752
I'm just curious how the FBI
goes about its business when
it's not kicking in doors.

35:01.800 --> 35:05.224
- You're lucky we're not doing
house-to-house interviews.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.625
We found a little piece of metal
in Elise Nichols' clothes--

35:07.670 --> 35:10.389
a shred from a pipe threader.

35:10.440 --> 35:15.230
- There must be hundreds
of construction sites
all over Minnesota.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.804
- A certain kind of metal,

35:16.840 --> 35:19.172
certain kind of pipe,
certain kind of pipe coating,

35:19.210 --> 35:22.213
so we're checking
all the construction sites
that use that kind of pipe.

35:22.250 --> 35:24.218
- What are we looking for?

35:24.250 --> 35:26.616
- At this stage,
anything really. But mostly,

35:26.650 --> 35:29.153
anything peculiar.

35:34.730 --> 35:37.198
- Two fellas from the FBI.

35:37.230 --> 35:39.790
They goin' through
the drawers now.

35:39.830 --> 35:42.537
Mm-hmm. Puttin' papers
in file boxes.

35:42.570 --> 35:45.767
Yes, they are
takin' things.

35:45.810 --> 35:48.506
No. Well,
they didn't say--

35:48.540 --> 35:50.770
Yes, they can.

35:50.810 --> 35:53.199
What did you say
your names were?

35:54.820 --> 35:56.742
- Garrett Jacob Hobbs?

35:56.780 --> 36:00.181
- He's one of our pipe
threaders. Those are all
the resignation letters.

36:00.220 --> 36:03.883
Plumbers' Union requires 'em
whenever members finish a job.

36:03.920 --> 36:05.956
(whispering): I'll
call you back.

36:05.990 --> 36:09.824
- Uh, does Mr. Hobbs
have a daughter?
- Might have.

36:09.860 --> 36:13.899
- Eighteen or 19, wind-chafed,
uh, plain but pretty.

36:13.930 --> 36:17.639
She'd have auburn hair,
about this tall.
- Maybe.

36:17.670 --> 36:20.230
I don't know. I don't keep
company with these people.

36:20.270 --> 36:22.977
- What is it
about Garrett Jacob Hobbs

36:23.010 --> 36:24.602
you find so peculiar?

36:24.650 --> 36:27.369
- He left a phone number,
no address.

36:27.410 --> 36:30.277
- And therefore he has
something to hide?

36:30.320 --> 36:32.311
- The others all left
addresses.

36:34.520 --> 36:36.909
Do you have an address
for Mr. Hobbs?

36:45.500 --> 36:47.263
I got it.

37:03.950 --> 37:06.418
(phone ringing)

37:09.490 --> 37:11.583
- Hello?

37:11.630 --> 37:13.586
Just a second. Dad.

37:13.630 --> 37:15.621
It's for you.

37:15.660 --> 37:17.025
- Who is it?

37:17.060 --> 37:19.392
- Caller ID said it was...

37:21.400 --> 37:23.789
- Hello?

37:23.840 --> 37:26.604
- [Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs?]

37:26.640 --> 37:28.369
- Yeah.

37:28.410 --> 37:31.004
- You don't know me
and I suspect we'll never meet.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.975
This is a courtesy call.
Listen very carefully.

37:37.620 --> 37:39.645
Are you listening?

37:39.690 --> 37:41.851
- Yes.

37:43.690 --> 37:45.885
- They know.

38:01.610 --> 38:04.807
(sound muted)
(soft ambient pulse)

38:16.890 --> 38:18.858
(Sound returns.)

38:18.890 --> 38:20.858
(birds singing)

38:20.890 --> 38:22.994
(rattling)

38:42.820 --> 38:46.415
-Ah... ah!

39:07.070 --> 39:09.971
- Garrett Jacob Hobbs! FBI!

39:13.910 --> 39:16.947
(girl whimpering)

39:22.620 --> 39:25.453
(gunshot)

39:38.570 --> 39:40.936
No, no, no.

39:44.080 --> 39:46.048
- See?

39:46.080 --> 39:48.071
See?

39:56.920 --> 39:58.626
(girl coughing and gasping)

39:58.660 --> 40:00.423
No, no, no.

40:50.940 --> 40:54.717
- (Alana): ...biting in lesser
assaults and bar fights,
child abuse...

40:54.750 --> 40:57.913
Emergency room personnel may be
very helpful that way.

40:57.950 --> 41:01.954
If they have any memories
of bad bites, no matter who was

41:01.990 --> 41:03.548
bitten or h--

41:03.590 --> 41:07.219
**

41:07.260 --> 41:08.796
- Where's Graham?

41:10.260 --> 41:12.865
- You said he wouldn't
get too close.

41:17.700 --> 41:22.979
