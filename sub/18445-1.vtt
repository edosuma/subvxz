00:57.133 --> 01:00.466
watch your speed, Diaz.
we don't need the cops pulling you over.

01:00.636 --> 01:02.866
-How far's the turnoff?
-Couple of miles.

01:03.039 --> 01:05.872
Puts you right on the interstate
out of Gotham.

01:06.809 --> 01:08.777
what was that?

01:14.116 --> 01:15.276
It's Batman, ain't it?

01:27.463 --> 01:30.227
Jeez Louise, it's a woman!

01:38.841 --> 01:41.241
what are you sitting there for?

02:14.543 --> 02:15.567
Get out!

02:56.886 --> 02:59.684
whoa, who's having the light show?

04:26.308 --> 04:28.970
Haven't seen her around the cave.

06:46.115 --> 06:50.279
Could she have been an old opponent
in a new disguise? Perhaps Catwoman.

06:50.452 --> 06:54.183
No, even Selina Kyle has
more regard for human life.

06:54.356 --> 06:56.324
This is someone entirely new, Alfred.

06:56.492 --> 06:59.427
The last thing Gotham needs
is a vigilante running amuck.

06:59.595 --> 07:02.496
As they say on the streets,
''I ain't touching that one.''

07:02.664 --> 07:05.724
The point is, her costume links her
to me. why?

07:05.901 --> 07:08.392
what does she have planned?
How far will she go?

07:08.570 --> 07:12.404
Do be careful. Remember, there are
many species in which the female...

07:12.574 --> 07:14.439
...is deadlier than the male.

07:42.271 --> 07:44.432
He's been waiting.

08:30.352 --> 08:33.048
It still lists to the right.
See what you can do.

08:33.222 --> 08:34.746
Penguin.

08:34.923 --> 08:38.688
Mr. Duquesne. I hear we had
an unpropitious setback.

08:38.861 --> 08:41.193
If you mean we got hit, yeah.

08:41.363 --> 08:44.423
And how exactly could that
have happened?

08:44.600 --> 08:48.798
I don't know yet. No one but us even knew
the shipment was going out last night.

08:48.971 --> 08:51.235
well, someone did.

08:55.010 --> 08:58.309
-A Batwoman?
-That's what my man said, Thorne.

08:58.480 --> 09:03.315
Batman, Batgirl, Batwoman!
what is it about this city? The water?

09:04.686 --> 09:06.847
Fortunately, it was only one truckload.

09:07.022 --> 09:09.582
I've doubled the manpower
at our warehouse sites.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.851
No way she can get to the rest.

09:12.027 --> 09:15.758
Forgive me if I'm not so sanguine.

09:15.931 --> 09:19.890
Our overseas consortium has paid us
a half-billion dollars for these arms.

09:20.068 --> 09:23.970
If we don't deliver, they'll want their
money back. Since we've spent it...

09:24.139 --> 09:27.006
...that would present a problem,
wouldn't it?

09:27.175 --> 09:29.769
I want the rest of it to be out
within the week...

09:29.945 --> 09:32.539
...which means take care
of this bat-clone now.

09:32.714 --> 09:38.050
You're supposed to be our muscle,
Mr. Duquesne. Start flexing.

10:00.576 --> 10:03.067
well, someone talked!
Someone dropped a dime!

10:03.245 --> 10:06.009
-we find out who, we'll find her.
-Daddy!

10:06.915 --> 10:08.177
Hold on.

10:09.952 --> 10:12.318
-where you been?
-Don't worry, Daddy.

10:12.487 --> 10:16.321
I brought your lapdogs with me.
For once, they came in handy.

10:16.491 --> 10:18.118
Shoo.

10:18.293 --> 10:22.059
So Raoul, my favorite hairdresser,
had a spiritual rebirth last week...

10:22.230 --> 10:24.596
...and left for an ashram in Bukittinggi.

10:24.766 --> 10:28.497
-How was your day?
-You should tell me when you go out.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.501
who's on the phone?

10:30.672 --> 10:33.607
Business. Nothing for you
to worry about.

10:33.775 --> 10:36.642
I guess I should be going then.

10:38.146 --> 10:41.775
we're getting dangerously close
to a conversation.

10:45.520 --> 10:50.014
Do whatever it takes. I want you
to find her. Find her and finish her!

10:52.361 --> 10:56.354
Today on Bat-watch, everyone wonders
who the mysterious Batwoman could be.

10:56.531 --> 11:01.867
Batman's new partner? Batgirl grown up?
We asked Police Commissioner Gordon.

11:02.204 --> 11:05.264
All I can say is,
she's not affiliated with Batman.

11:05.440 --> 11:08.705
Otherwise, I have no comment.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.708
Det. Bullock! Harvey!

11:10.879 --> 11:13.712
I think we got enough bat-freaks
in Gotham already.

11:13.882 --> 11:16.874
I mean, what's next? Bat-hound?

11:17.052 --> 11:20.488
Come on, Bullock, throw us
a bone here, will you?

11:22.290 --> 11:26.727
You know, I've been thinking about getting
a dog. He could help us sniff out clues.

11:30.499 --> 11:32.558
-Bruce wayne here.
-Bruce, it's Barbara.

11:32.734 --> 11:33.894
Hey, Barb.

11:34.069 --> 11:36.799
-She misses you.
-How's college?

11:36.972 --> 11:41.409
Not bad, though the nightlife here
can't compare with kicking butt as Batgirl.

11:41.576 --> 11:46.513
But spring break'll be coming up soon, and
I'll be back in Gotham for two whole weeks.

11:46.682 --> 11:47.910
won't that be nice?

11:49.017 --> 11:51.247
Yes, we'll all be happy to see you.

11:51.420 --> 11:52.751
Don't drag me into this.

11:52.921 --> 11:54.980
Anyway, that's not the reason I called.

11:55.157 --> 11:58.524
I just saw the news and was wondering
if you got a new partner.

11:58.694 --> 12:01.162
Someone a little older?

12:01.329 --> 12:02.921
I have no idea who she is.

12:03.098 --> 12:05.430
Because if you had,
I'd be really upset...

12:05.600 --> 12:08.831
...because I thought you and I were,
you know....

12:09.004 --> 12:13.441
Barb, we're going through
the East Tunnel now.

12:13.608 --> 12:17.442
Afraid signal's breaking up.
Talk later.

12:20.015 --> 12:21.880
Squeaked through again, didn't you?

12:22.050 --> 12:25.019
I never fail to marvel
at your narrow escapes, sir.

12:25.187 --> 12:28.054
One female bat at a time.

12:34.796 --> 12:37.731
In discussing this new alloy,
I brought some charts...

12:37.899 --> 12:42.302
...to demonstrate the care and precision
we bring to our work at wayne Tech.

12:46.074 --> 12:49.976
So as you can see, the alloy's tensile
malleability is remarkably high...

12:50.145 --> 12:52.909
...given its density
and homeotropic structure.

12:53.081 --> 12:57.814
Meaning that the flexible
molecular stacking will...

12:58.253 --> 13:01.586
...provide considerable morphological
adaptability...

13:01.757 --> 13:05.488
...through the electromagnetic
manipulation of the quantum states!

13:18.540 --> 13:23.102
See this chunk of metal?
I can program it to change shape.

13:26.782 --> 13:29.114
-Oh, fantastic.
-That's fantastic.

13:33.955 --> 13:36.446
I thought she said it was metal.

13:37.526 --> 13:40.120
-Look at that.
-It's beautiful.

13:40.295 --> 13:42.456
Just with one touch?

13:49.171 --> 13:51.867
So exciting.

13:58.880 --> 14:01.075
Actually, the technology's pretty simple.

14:01.249 --> 14:04.116
It's just imprinting morph lines
with a pressure point.

14:04.286 --> 14:08.052
-I'm not sure what it's good for.
-I happen to have a silent partner...

14:08.223 --> 14:11.249
-...who I'm sure will find some use for it.
-That's great.

14:11.426 --> 14:15.886
It's so cool to be in an R&D company
that takes young women seriously...

14:16.064 --> 14:17.531
...especially blonds.

14:17.699 --> 14:21.430
At wayne Tech, it's what's under
the hair that counts, Dr. Ballantine.

14:21.603 --> 14:23.503
It's Rocky. Actually, Roxanne...

14:23.672 --> 14:28.006
...but people have always called me
Rocky for some reason.

14:28.844 --> 14:30.778
Look! It's the bat signal!

14:30.946 --> 14:32.846
-where?
-Right there!

14:33.014 --> 14:35.448
what's going on over there?

14:35.617 --> 14:39.018
wow! I've never seen it before!
Isn't it exciting?

14:39.187 --> 14:41.917
Every time. Check.

14:49.264 --> 14:54.224
He'll get here. And remember,
when he does, I'll do the talking.

15:04.246 --> 15:05.577
what is it, commissioner?

15:05.747 --> 15:09.148
I had Bullock collect the remains
of the contraband destroyed.

15:09.317 --> 15:12.115
I thought you might like to take a look.

15:13.388 --> 15:17.654
Stuff's out of Star Trek. I thought
maybe someone broke into a toy store.

15:17.826 --> 15:20.659
These aren't toys, Bullock.
This is a plasma rifle.

15:20.829 --> 15:22.956
It could take out a tank at 200 yards.

15:23.131 --> 15:26.259
More like 500.
I measured the clip size.

15:26.434 --> 15:28.994
Sonia Alcana, Bullock's new partner.

15:29.170 --> 15:33.436
There are also EK4 lasers and a barrel
from a surface-to-air missile launcher.

15:33.608 --> 15:36.406
-who's behind this?
-The truck driver ain't talking...

15:36.578 --> 15:39.877
...but I got some leads. Can't say
anything definite right now.

15:40.048 --> 15:41.913
we have nothing.

15:42.717 --> 15:45.151
-where'd you get this?
-From the guy's truck...

15:45.320 --> 15:47.584
...when I had it impounded.

15:48.056 --> 15:49.990
I'll get back to you.

15:53.094 --> 15:56.928
what's got his tights in a twist?

16:08.009 --> 16:09.601
Penguin owns this place?

16:09.778 --> 16:12.440
Along with Duquesne and Thorne.

16:12.681 --> 16:15.946
-what do they make here?
-Trinkets, figurines...

16:16.117 --> 16:20.850
...weapons of mass destruction.
I don't see any of his goons around.

16:33.301 --> 16:35.292
There she is!

16:40.141 --> 16:41.699
See her?

16:48.650 --> 16:50.641
Over there!

17:05.834 --> 17:09.667
So you like to play rough, huh, sweetie?

17:15.477 --> 17:17.468
welcome to superhero team-up!

17:17.645 --> 17:19.510
Get them!

17:20.348 --> 17:22.281
Come on!

17:34.996 --> 17:36.725
-You shouldn't be here.
-Likewise.

17:36.898 --> 17:38.866
No. I mean, I've set a charge.

17:39.034 --> 17:40.865
where?

17:41.269 --> 17:43.260
Below us.

17:44.706 --> 17:46.640
A munitions room.

18:06.628 --> 18:09.256
Let's get out of here!

18:19.140 --> 18:20.471
where'd she go?

18:20.975 --> 18:22.465
Up there!

18:25.480 --> 18:27.414
Let's move!

18:44.999 --> 18:47.832
They were making arms for Kasnia...

18:49.504 --> 18:54.441
...something the State Department would
frown upon. This was their weapons plant.

18:57.412 --> 19:01.974
-It would be a little hard to prove that now.
-Doesn't matter. They were finished here.

19:02.150 --> 19:04.516
But I've just begun.

19:04.953 --> 19:07.114
who are you? why are you doing this?

19:07.288 --> 19:10.553
You're the great detective. Figure it out.

19:18.533 --> 19:20.728
Gotta jet.

20:06.915 --> 20:08.940
who? The Batwoman?

20:09.117 --> 20:13.019
what do you mean it's gone?
The whole building?

20:30.205 --> 20:32.070
You got a lot of nerve, freak!

20:32.240 --> 20:35.539
You and your woman have caused me
enough grief for one night.

20:36.211 --> 20:40.443
It's my home, my family! Get out!

20:56.030 --> 20:58.464
I heard a commotion last night.
who was here?

20:58.900 --> 21:00.868
Nobody.

21:04.572 --> 21:06.005
Did nobody do that too?

21:06.307 --> 21:08.901
Nothing for you to worry about.

21:09.244 --> 21:10.734
As if I ever.

21:10.912 --> 21:13.005
-where you going?
-Nowhere.

21:15.917 --> 21:17.350
Do they have to come?

21:17.518 --> 21:19.315
Just for the next couple days.

21:19.487 --> 21:23.617
I'm having trouble with some people.
I don't want you to have any problems.

21:23.925 --> 21:27.326
You mean like Mama problems?

21:27.495 --> 21:31.261
You live under my roof in my town.
You do what I say!

21:32.834 --> 21:34.597
Fetch.

21:42.610 --> 21:43.668
That's her.

21:47.348 --> 21:49.839
Exactly what is it you hope
to discover?

21:50.018 --> 21:52.680
what a beautiful young woman does
in her free time.

21:52.854 --> 21:54.788
A pleasure drive then.

22:00.728 --> 22:04.186
I see why Dennis the Menace
is one step closer to juvenile hall.

22:04.365 --> 22:08.529
-How many stores does this make so far?
-Including the nail boutique, seven.

22:08.703 --> 22:11.797
And not one sale on explosives.

22:12.540 --> 22:15.941
You know, Alfred, I think I could use
a new watch.

22:16.110 --> 22:18.305
You deserve it, sir.

22:29.824 --> 22:33.885
Brown taffeta? what are they thinking?

22:37.899 --> 22:41.767
It's a dressing room! The worst that
can happen is, I'll need a size 8!

22:41.936 --> 22:45.269
why don't you go rob gift wrap
or something?

22:47.408 --> 22:50.172
I miss working for The Joker.

22:54.182 --> 22:57.674
-Sir, could you help me?
-Sorry, I don't work here.

22:57.852 --> 23:02.949
No, not that. See those men?
I'd rather they not see me.

23:03.124 --> 23:06.355
If you could just help me get
to the escalator....

23:07.295 --> 23:12.562
Okay. Usually, you only see things
like this in the movies.

23:13.434 --> 23:16.096
Hey, wait! Miss Duquesne!

23:16.270 --> 23:18.135
who's she with?

23:24.112 --> 23:26.012
Keep going.

23:58.479 --> 24:00.276
Oh, dear.

24:03.818 --> 24:05.649
You're good.

24:05.820 --> 24:08.152
Here they come.

24:08.456 --> 24:12.916
Hurry, get in. Unless you want
that lovely face rearranged.

24:13.895 --> 24:16.989
-Hey, stop!
-You crazy?

24:28.342 --> 24:31.709
-who were they?
-Daddy's bodyguards.

24:34.282 --> 24:36.876
You've just run off
with a very notorious woman.

24:37.051 --> 24:39.884
I'm Kathy Duquesne,
daughter of Carlton Duquesne.

24:40.288 --> 24:41.482
The gangster?

24:41.656 --> 24:45.387
Yes, but we try not to use
the G word in front of Daddy.

24:54.535 --> 24:57.402
This is interesting.
I think we're being followed.

24:57.572 --> 25:02.475
Doesn't look like Daddy's goon squad.
Hope you're not expected anywhere.

25:07.849 --> 25:10.249
You're on your own, Master Bruce.

25:20.228 --> 25:22.662
we having fun yet?

25:41.849 --> 25:44.010
Bruce wayne?

25:44.519 --> 25:45.747
what a photo op!

25:45.920 --> 25:49.788
The most respected man in Gotham with
the daughter of the most disrespected.

25:49.957 --> 25:52.653
Your father has a lot of competition
for that title.

25:52.827 --> 25:56.661
I know. Most of them come to dinner
from time to time.

25:57.932 --> 26:01.493
I used to wonder what it's like to come
from a respectable family...

26:01.669 --> 26:05.662
...where there's no violence,
no vendettas, no victims.

26:05.840 --> 26:07.808
what must that feel like?

26:07.975 --> 26:10.569
I wish I could tell you.

26:10.745 --> 26:12.337
It must feel like freedom.

26:12.713 --> 26:14.442
Kathy, be careful.

26:14.615 --> 26:19.712
You sound like my mama. ''Be careful,
Kathy. Don't go scaring me, girl.''

26:20.888 --> 26:24.119
This was our favorite spot.
we used to come out here to paint.

26:24.292 --> 26:27.557
She was a great artist.
She said I had the eye.

26:27.728 --> 26:32.062
She said, ''Honey, you could be
another Carrie Mae weems.''

26:32.633 --> 26:34.100
what happened?

26:34.268 --> 26:36.395
what happened?

26:36.571 --> 26:39.404
She died. Isn't that
what always happens?

26:39.574 --> 26:41.064
I'm sorry.

26:41.242 --> 26:43.142
Everyone's sorry.

26:43.311 --> 26:45.745
It doesn't make any difference.

27:19.513 --> 27:24.610
Here. Bring it back sometime.
Or not. There's always plenty more.

27:29.290 --> 27:31.622
Down, boys.

28:02.823 --> 28:07.260
I met Batwoman. She confirmed they were
making the weapons at Penguin's factory.

28:07.428 --> 28:10.056
-who is she?
-I think Carlton Duquesne's daughter.

28:10.231 --> 28:13.098
Remember the assassination attempt
on him 1 0 years ago?

28:13.267 --> 28:16.532
Yeah, they missed him.
Hit his wife instead.

28:16.704 --> 28:20.265
I think Kathy Duquesne blames her father
for that and a lot more.

28:20.441 --> 28:22.966
Come on, she'd be biting
the hand that feeds her.

28:23.144 --> 28:25.237
Think of the dough her old man has.

28:25.413 --> 28:27.608
You can't buy peace of mind, Bullock.

28:27.782 --> 28:29.647
Let's keep a tail on her.

28:35.456 --> 28:40.359
I see Miss Duquesne is gifted
in other sports besides extreme shopping.

28:40.528 --> 28:43.827
This bodes well for your suspicions,
does it not, Master Bruce?

28:43.998 --> 28:45.863
Yes, Alfred.

28:51.539 --> 28:56.033
-what's with him?
-I think he has some affection for this one.

28:56.510 --> 28:58.944
He sure can pick them.

29:14.228 --> 29:18.062
Relax, Penguin. we were gonna torch
the place for the money anyway.

29:18.232 --> 29:22.692
I don't think you appreciate
the precariousness of our perch, Thorne...

29:22.870 --> 29:25.634
...especially now that we have no factory!

29:25.806 --> 29:29.469
If we're unable to deliver the rest
of our stockpile, we're dead.

29:29.643 --> 29:32.305
The Kasnians will come after us
like wolverines.

29:32.480 --> 29:33.970
we'll be begging for prison.

29:34.148 --> 29:36.708
Duquesne says he can handle
the bat-broad.

29:36.884 --> 29:39.978
She almost killed Batman,
for heaven's sake!

29:40.154 --> 29:42.418
Normally, I would find
that commendable...

29:42.590 --> 29:45.821
...but now it just proves
that Duquesne is out of his league.

29:45.993 --> 29:48.894
we need some real muscle.

30:24.265 --> 30:28.861
whoever you want to bring in,
Penguin, is fine with me.

30:39.380 --> 30:41.780
I can't believe this!

30:43.617 --> 30:46.051
who are they getting?
who's better than you?

30:46.220 --> 30:48.211
Penguin's not saying.

30:51.192 --> 30:53.422
Get out. Get out!

31:00.234 --> 31:05.331
First you click on the red crystal, then
the blue, then hold down the shift key.

31:11.078 --> 31:13.603
whoa! You got in!

31:15.382 --> 31:17.441
I've raided a few tombs in my time.

31:17.685 --> 31:21.246
She found the secret bonus level
to ''Death Castle 3000'' !

31:21.422 --> 31:24.619
Nobody at school can figure it out.
The guys are gonna flip.

31:25.059 --> 31:29.758
So is Alfred. He's been waiting
in the car for you all this time.

31:30.164 --> 31:31.791
Thanks.

31:33.534 --> 31:35.399
-working late again?
-Yeah.

31:35.569 --> 31:39.403
Fortunately, my boyfriend
is very understanding. what about yours?

31:39.573 --> 31:43.839
Girlfriend! I mean, of course girlfriend.
After all, considering your reputation.

31:44.011 --> 31:47.742
Not that it's bad or anything or any
of my business, because it's not.

31:47.915 --> 31:50.475
I was just curious.
How red is my face?

31:50.985 --> 31:53.681
Crimson. And no, I don't
have anybody special.

31:53.854 --> 31:56.846
Am I that forgettable, Bruce?

32:03.130 --> 32:05.530
I've managed to lose my shadows
for a while...

32:05.699 --> 32:07.860
...and I thought I'd paint the town red.

32:08.035 --> 32:11.266
want to come along
and empty a few spray cans?

32:15.142 --> 32:18.305
Excuse me, Kathy Duquesne,
Roxanne Ballantine.

32:18.479 --> 32:21.448
-Pleased to meet you.
-Yes, I'm sorry.

32:21.615 --> 32:24.550
-About what?
-I don't know.

32:36.096 --> 32:38.496
So you never got married, huh?

32:38.666 --> 32:41.726
Hard to believe. Here she comes.

32:41.902 --> 32:46.032
well, what do you know?
It's the trash picking up the trash.

33:42.596 --> 33:45.531
Hey, K.D.

33:45.699 --> 33:47.929
Looking hot.

33:48.602 --> 33:51.594
You got some fries with that shake?

33:55.142 --> 33:58.009
I know, not exactly
the book-club crowd.

33:58.178 --> 34:04.515
-I suppose you know who owns this place.
-She should. I bought her her first parasol.

34:04.685 --> 34:06.152
-Kathleen.
-Ozzie.

34:06.320 --> 34:09.585
And Mr. wayne.
It's been quite a while, hasn't it?

34:09.757 --> 34:12.623
Yes. The last time was when
you stole plutonium...

34:12.793 --> 34:16.092
...from one of my labs
and threatened to blow up the city.

34:16.263 --> 34:20.666
Oh, yes, my more
rambunctious days.

34:21.467 --> 34:23.129
Sir, your call just came in.

34:23.303 --> 34:27.137
The vagaries of a restaurateur.
You understand.

34:29.043 --> 34:31.170
Didn't know you and Penguin
had issues.

34:31.344 --> 34:34.109
It's not the bird
that's bothering me, it's you.

34:34.281 --> 34:36.647
-what kind of game are you playing?
-Game?

34:36.817 --> 34:39.945
You dump your guards for a night,
and where do you go?

34:40.120 --> 34:42.782
A club where the patrons
are your father's cronies.

34:42.956 --> 34:45.652
It's like you want him to hear about it.

34:45.826 --> 34:50.592
I'm not sure I like your tone.
I think I'll decide in the powder room.

34:58.272 --> 35:02.504
So you've already landed. Splendid.
How soon before we can commiserate?

35:02.810 --> 35:06.837
I can drop by your club tonight.
I assume you have a back entrance.

35:07.014 --> 35:11.451
Oh, yes. I use it so much,
I'm thinking of installing a revolving door.

35:11.618 --> 35:13.415
See you then.

35:14.455 --> 35:18.824
-I said I wasn't to be disturbed.
-Oh, am I disturbing you?

35:18.992 --> 35:21.324
Can't have that, can we?

35:28.769 --> 35:33.138
How dare you? Release me at once,
you harridan, or I'll--

35:33.307 --> 35:34.399
They're constricting.

35:34.575 --> 35:39.740
They'll slice a penguin like a turkey,
unless you tell me who your new player is.

35:55.062 --> 35:58.327
who, Penguin?
who's the big, bad boogeyman?

35:59.066 --> 36:01.296
I can't hear you.

36:01.468 --> 36:04.869
-Bane.
-Bane?!

36:56.256 --> 36:57.484
No, run this way.

37:05.098 --> 37:08.795
A bat-seeking missile for you, my dear.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.383
You hear that?

37:25.085 --> 37:26.245
Call for backup!

37:35.562 --> 37:38.122
Time to burn a bat.

38:15.569 --> 38:19.232
Come on, let's see those
pointy little ears.

38:36.556 --> 38:38.217
-Stay together, come on.
-Hurry!

38:38.558 --> 38:40.549
It must've been a heck of a floorshow.

38:56.843 --> 39:00.779
I have to admit, not every date
I have ends with a police investigation.

39:00.947 --> 39:04.906
You poor thing. Every time we're
together I seem to risk your life.

39:05.085 --> 39:08.213
I'm sorry about tonight.
You were right about me.

39:08.388 --> 39:11.050
No, no, don't say that.
I jumped to conclusions.

39:11.858 --> 39:17.387
I was wrong about you. And tonight....
Tonight turned out wonderfully.

39:20.934 --> 39:22.697
The old man wants you.

39:22.869 --> 39:27.533
I'd invite you in, but I think
it's going to be chilly upstairs.

39:41.555 --> 39:43.546
Souvenir?

39:43.990 --> 39:45.787
I found it in the Penguin's club.

39:45.959 --> 39:49.554
How about an autograph?
Make it a real collector's item.

39:51.398 --> 39:54.424
-what did you learn at the lounge?
-Other than the fact...

39:54.601 --> 39:57.968
...that Kathy Duquesne
can't be Batwoman, not much.

39:58.138 --> 40:02.666
I found this in his office. I think
Batwoman used it on him. I kept a piece.

40:02.843 --> 40:05.869
You know removing evidence
from the scene of a crime is...

40:06.313 --> 40:08.679
...probably not gonna lose you
any sleep.

40:08.849 --> 40:10.680
Call it a souvenir.

40:12.519 --> 40:14.510
You saved my life once.

40:15.255 --> 40:19.282
Nine years ago. Arsonists,
they burned my parents' shop.

40:19.459 --> 40:22.622
I was sleeping.
we lived on the second floor.

40:22.796 --> 40:26.061
My room was filled with smoke.
I couldn't find the window.

40:26.233 --> 40:29.293
The floor was hot, flames shooting
between the floorboards.

40:29.836 --> 40:32.134
And then, there you were.

40:32.305 --> 40:35.638
I remember. The arsonists
were working for Rupert Thorne.

40:35.809 --> 40:39.301
Part of his protection racket.
The DA couldn't make the case stick.

40:39.679 --> 40:42.773
Yeah, that's why I decided
to become a cop.

40:42.949 --> 40:45.918
I just thought you should know.

41:01.501 --> 41:03.401
That's tight. what's it mean?

41:03.603 --> 41:07.903
The wire from Penguin's office is identical
to the alloy Dr. Ballantine developed.

41:08.942 --> 41:12.605
Rocky? You think someone's
using her stuff?

41:22.656 --> 41:24.385
Arms up.

41:28.061 --> 41:29.824
Proceed.

41:41.107 --> 41:44.270
-Kevin, are you okay?
-No, Rocky, I'm not okay.

41:44.444 --> 41:46.844
I'm so far from okay,
I can't even see it.

41:47.013 --> 41:49.709
Don't give up. we're close.
Really close.

41:49.883 --> 41:52.943
Once someone in Penguin's
organization is willing to talk--

41:53.119 --> 41:55.713
You can't keep doing this.
It's too dangerous.

41:55.889 --> 42:00.189
-If Penguin finds out you're spying on him--
-He won't. I can take care of myself.

42:00.360 --> 42:04.262
I'm not the wimp I used to be.
I've changed. I've had to.

42:04.431 --> 42:07.127
You'd have to be Supergirl
to stand a chance.

42:07.300 --> 42:09.461
You don't know what I've been doing.

42:09.803 --> 42:14.206
Look, Rocky, I don't want
to see you anymore.

42:14.374 --> 42:18.435
-You aren't--
-Serious? I'm dead serious.

42:18.612 --> 42:21.775
I've got five more years here
before I get a shot at parole.

42:21.948 --> 42:24.644
It's stupid to waste your life
waiting for me.

42:24.818 --> 42:29.084
-It's my life. I can waste it any way I want.
-Don't come here again, Rocky.

42:29.256 --> 42:32.157
-If you do, I won't see you.
-Kevin?

42:32.325 --> 42:35.317
Kevin, no! Listen to me.

42:35.495 --> 42:37.326
Kevin!

42:48.608 --> 42:52.203
You have no new messages.

43:07.761 --> 43:10.821
-Batman?
-Nice moves for a computer geek.

43:10.997 --> 43:13.522
I used to-- I mean--
well, so what?

43:13.700 --> 43:16.533
I took self-defense classes,
like millions of women.

43:16.703 --> 43:19.467
Now it's your turn.
why are you in my apartment?

43:19.639 --> 43:21.470
Checking out your new designs.

43:21.641 --> 43:23.973
They're beyond what you're doing
for wayne.

43:24.144 --> 43:28.137
-You were--? You had no right to--
-where were you last night?

43:28.315 --> 43:32.308
-I was at wayne Tech.
-You left by 7:00.

43:32.485 --> 43:36.819
-well, I went for a walk.
-To the lceberg Lounge?

43:36.990 --> 43:41.290
wait a minute, are you trying
to say I'm Batwoman? You're not serious.

43:41.461 --> 43:44.328
Recognize this? Batwoman used it.

43:44.497 --> 43:48.126
It has the same configuration
as the alloy you developed for wayne Tech.

43:48.301 --> 43:51.668
So? I'm hardly the only one
working in metallurgy.

43:51.838 --> 43:55.535
True, but you're the right body type.
And you have a motive.

43:55.709 --> 43:58.507
Your fiancé was framed
for smuggling by the Penguin.

43:58.678 --> 44:01.340
And I know someone
broke into the Penguin's files.

44:01.514 --> 44:05.644
Yeah? So what? Of course I'm trying
to get Kevin's sentence commuted...

44:05.819 --> 44:09.118
...but I'm not doing anything illegal.
Here's a radical notion:

44:09.289 --> 44:12.156
Instead of me, how about you
investigate the birdman?

44:12.325 --> 44:16.659
I bet there's lots more
incriminating evidence on his hard drives.

44:17.497 --> 44:21.126
This game you're playing has high stakes,
higher than you know.

44:21.301 --> 44:24.065
You could get hurt or worse.

44:25.271 --> 44:27.899
You sound just like him.

44:38.418 --> 44:40.511
I checked the warehouses
this morning.

44:40.687 --> 44:43.884
-No reports of any trouble.
-Yet.

44:44.557 --> 44:46.184
There's our cheerful associate.

44:52.098 --> 44:55.158
Shall we meet and greet, gentlemen?

45:15.655 --> 45:20.683
Penguin, I have reviewed your proposal
for my employment.

45:20.860 --> 45:23.852
I'm sorry, but your terms
are not acceptable.

45:24.030 --> 45:27.659
I want carte blanche,
complete control of the operation.

45:27.834 --> 45:29.131
I answer to no one.

45:29.302 --> 45:32.271
Now wait, you can't just
roll in here and give orders.

45:32.439 --> 45:35.772
I just did, Se?or Duquesne.

45:43.850 --> 45:48.810
Do not worry. If this Batwoman
attempts any interference at all....

45:53.727 --> 45:58.460
He has a way with words.
Now, shall we discuss the shipment?

45:58.765 --> 46:00.960
This time we have spared no expense.

46:01.134 --> 46:07.266
we're using a luxury cruise liner
as our cover, and the ship sails tonight.

46:09.042 --> 46:11.977
-what's the matter?
-The night you and I saw Batwoman...

46:12.178 --> 46:14.874
...Rocky Ballantine was working
late at wayne Tech.

46:15.048 --> 46:17.983
I knew she couldn't be Batwoman.
She's too nice.

46:18.384 --> 46:19.976
I was so sure this time.

46:20.153 --> 46:22.383
well, she can't be
in two places at once...

46:22.555 --> 46:25.888
...unless she has the power
to duplicate herself.

46:27.794 --> 46:29.261
Robin, get on the computer.

46:29.429 --> 46:33.889
I need you to cross-reference all databases
on Kathy Duquesne and Roxanne Ballantine.

46:34.067 --> 46:37.059
Find anything that connects them.
Anything.

46:37.237 --> 46:40.695
-where are you going?
-To make a house call.

47:04.030 --> 47:08.831
I've got it all: Their plans, the timetable,
the manpower, Bane's agenda--

47:09.002 --> 47:10.401
-He's onto me.
-what?

47:10.904 --> 47:13.236
Batman, he knows everything about me:

47:13.406 --> 47:17.843
where I work, what I do,
all about Kevin. It's uncanny.

47:18.011 --> 47:22.243
-So what?
-So what? He's gonna ruin everything!

47:22.415 --> 47:26.442
I told you we should've created
a new identity, not just spun it off him.

47:26.619 --> 47:31.716
She's right, look at how fast he caught
onto me. we didn't count on this.

47:31.891 --> 47:35.292
So he thinks you're Batwoman.
Two days ago he thought it was you.

47:35.461 --> 47:37.452
Tomorrow he'll think
it's someone else.

47:37.630 --> 47:42.590
Trust me, if he really had any idea
what's going on, I would know.

47:42.769 --> 47:47.638
we are so close to our goal. we stop them
tonight, and we've broken them.

47:47.807 --> 47:49.934
-Tonight?
-They're moving that fast?

47:50.109 --> 47:55.445
Not fast enough for us, Rocky.
Never fast enough for us.

48:21.274 --> 48:23.333
Somebody in here?

48:30.783 --> 48:34.275
-Something wrong?
-Nope.

49:08.021 --> 49:10.182
-Yes.
-I got some bad news for you.

49:10.356 --> 49:14.122
Or maybe good. There's no connection
between Kathy and Rocky.

49:15.194 --> 49:17.458
Different cities, circles and planets.

49:17.931 --> 49:20.263
No way they could've
known each other.

49:20.633 --> 49:22.601
Yes, there is.

49:22.769 --> 49:25.738
All they needed was someone
to introduce them.

49:30.743 --> 49:33.041
Remember, once they load the ship...

49:33.212 --> 49:36.010
...Bane will station himself
in the pilot's cabin...

49:36.182 --> 49:39.276
...with guards at checkpoints.
You get past this one...

49:39.452 --> 49:42.148
...and it's straight to the atrium
and the weapons.

49:42.322 --> 49:44.017
And the gift boutiques.

49:44.190 --> 49:47.284
Kathy, the detonator
has a failsafe countdown.

49:47.460 --> 49:49.758
I wouldn't shop too long.

49:50.263 --> 49:52.231
I guess this is it.

49:59.205 --> 50:01.503
You sure you're gonna be all right?

50:01.674 --> 50:04.768
Don't worry, I'll be back.

51:18.918 --> 51:20.783
Se?orita.

51:39.105 --> 51:42.973
would you stop that infernal tapping?
In a few minutes the ship will be...

51:43.142 --> 51:47.408
...in international waters,
and we'll be very rich men.

51:47.580 --> 51:48.672
Gin.

51:52.585 --> 51:56.043
Yes. Yes, he's here. we're all here.

51:56.222 --> 51:57.985
She did?

51:58.357 --> 52:02.293
No. You want us now?

52:02.462 --> 52:04.362
-Is the shipment--?
-It's fine...

52:04.530 --> 52:09.695
...but he's not leaving the harbor yet.
He has Batwoman.

52:10.570 --> 52:13.539
Mustn't keep the lady waiting.

52:21.848 --> 52:23.907
-Batman?
-You knew Kathy Duquesne.

52:24.083 --> 52:26.483
-what?
-You both took art classes together.

52:26.652 --> 52:31.419
She sketched your face. It was years ago,
but it's you. Kathy had a good eye.

52:32.258 --> 52:34.749
-You also knew Rocky Ballantine.
-who?

52:34.927 --> 52:38.488
Let me jog your memory.
State University, freshman year.

52:38.664 --> 52:41.929
Same dorm, same floor, same room.

52:42.602 --> 52:44.035
You've been a busy bat.

52:44.203 --> 52:47.263
You each brought something
to the party. Kathy had money...

52:47.440 --> 52:50.967
...Rocky had the genius
and you had the scheme...

52:51.144 --> 52:52.839
...and the will to make it happen.

52:55.262 --> 52:59.358
when that fire destroyed my folks'
business, they never recovered.

52:59.533 --> 53:03.560
They'd worked their whole lives,
and then it was ashes, just like that.

53:03.737 --> 53:05.830
It tore our family apart.

53:06.006 --> 53:09.999
Everyone knew it was Rupert Thorne,
but there was no way to prove it.

53:10.177 --> 53:14.580
Now he's gonna know how it feels
to see his life go up in smoke.

53:15.483 --> 53:20.978
Three Batwomen. It was just a matter
of disguising your voices and taking turns.

53:21.422 --> 53:25.825
And you know what? It almost worked.

53:26.393 --> 53:29.191
where is Kathy Duquesne?

53:35.169 --> 53:37.433
-I'm here.
-Something's definitely wrong.

53:37.605 --> 53:40.073
There's no report
of any ship in distress.

53:40.241 --> 53:44.177
I radioed Kathy, but she's not responding.
She's in trouble, I can feel it.

53:44.345 --> 53:45.505
what're we gonna do?

53:47.515 --> 53:49.415
Sonia?

54:29.723 --> 54:32.385
Olé, se?or. Exemplary work.

54:32.893 --> 54:36.260
I wanted you here
when I realized who she was.

54:36.430 --> 54:38.990
I felt a certain caution was in order.

54:39.166 --> 54:41.191
So who is she?

54:43.437 --> 54:46.497
-Kathy?
-what's going on, Duquesne?

54:46.674 --> 54:50.906
-No wonder she always knew our plans.
-what? You think I told her?

54:51.078 --> 54:53.171
She planned to use this.

54:53.347 --> 54:57.249
Don't let the size fool you, se?ores,
it's a carbonite bomb.

54:57.418 --> 54:59.852
It can take out this
entire chamber and more.

55:00.020 --> 55:02.580
Are you crazy?
How could you do this to me?!

55:02.756 --> 55:06.954
It was easy, Daddy. You made it easy,
because of the kind of man you are.

55:07.127 --> 55:10.585
A man whose wife is killed
just because she stands next to him.

55:10.764 --> 55:13.790
The kind of man who makes a prison
out of his own house...

55:13.968 --> 55:15.833
...a prisoner out of his own child.

55:16.003 --> 55:19.166
The kind of man who spreads misery
to everything he touches.

55:19.340 --> 55:22.776
-And for what? For them?!
-Shut up!

55:24.211 --> 55:27.271
-This doesn't make sense!
-On that we agree...

55:27.448 --> 55:30.679
...because I distinctly remember
your daughter at my lounge...

55:30.851 --> 55:32.910
...the same night Batwoman
assaulted me.

55:33.220 --> 55:37.088
You're not in this alone,
are you, Kathleen?

55:37.491 --> 55:39.755
who else?

55:41.061 --> 55:43.029
Penguin, no!

55:46.100 --> 55:47.294
No, don't!

55:47.468 --> 55:52.098
Tell me who else is involved
while Daddy still has a neck.

56:12.426 --> 56:16.362
Bon voyage, Se?or Batman.

56:55.502 --> 57:00.462
Bridge, head out to sea.
I want us in international waters now.

57:12.419 --> 57:16.515
-They're heading to sea. what do you think?
-Batman said he'd give a signal...

57:16.690 --> 57:19.682
...but that doesn't mean
we can't take a closer look.

57:26.266 --> 57:27.597
You're out, Duquesne.

57:27.768 --> 57:30.168
I shouldn't have got mixed up
with you.

57:30.337 --> 57:34.467
well, that'll give you and your brat
something to talk about in family therapy.

57:34.641 --> 57:37.576
where's the bomb? wasn't it here?

57:45.085 --> 57:47.178
It's not over yet, amigo.

57:58.365 --> 58:00.799
-Here.
-I could've gotten out of them.

58:00.968 --> 58:03.198
No doubt, since you
got yourself into them.

58:03.370 --> 58:07.136
Your friends are waiting to rescue you.
Let's not disappoint them.

58:09.443 --> 58:11.741
No, let's not.

58:15.382 --> 58:18.317
Don't! Break the magnets,
and it'll go off.

58:18.485 --> 58:20.817
There's no way to stop it
without the code...

58:20.988 --> 58:23.616
...which escapes me at the moment.

58:24.324 --> 58:28.192
I'm sorry, but one way
or another it has to end.

58:36.370 --> 58:40.966
Even if she doesn't have the bomb I suggest
we act like cautious birds and head south.

58:41.475 --> 58:44.933
well, what do you know?
Our two favorite felons.

58:45.112 --> 58:47.239
Egads, they're multiplying.

58:53.987 --> 58:57.445
That felt so good.
Now where's Kathy Duquesne?

59:05.399 --> 59:06.866
Daddy!

59:26.353 --> 59:31.655
I knew sooner or later we would
face each other, Batman. I prayed for it.

59:31.859 --> 59:34.293
This ship is going down
in less than a minute.

59:34.461 --> 59:37.521
That's all the time I need.

59:46.206 --> 59:48.037
Should've saved those prayers.

01:00:54.474 --> 01:00:57.466
-Abandon ship?
-You think?

01:00:59.212 --> 01:01:01.339
Let's go. Double-time it.
Come on now.

01:01:01.515 --> 01:01:04.382
-would you move it?
-Get over. I wanna get out of here.

01:01:04.551 --> 01:01:06.382
Let's get going. Get out of here!

01:01:07.487 --> 01:01:09.455
Come on, lower, lower, lower.

01:01:18.899 --> 01:01:20.196
Sonia!

01:02:01.108 --> 01:02:03.702
-I got her.
-Don't worry about me.

01:02:03.877 --> 01:02:05.936
Just get them!

01:03:51.251 --> 01:03:53.242
The ship's going down, Penguin.

01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:57.857
Our only consolation is that
it will take a few bats with it.

01:04:00.627 --> 01:04:02.356
what?

01:04:43.036 --> 01:04:45.596
And I thought penguins liked the water.

01:05:35.889 --> 01:05:39.757
Estupido! No bonds can hold me!

01:05:41.828 --> 01:05:43.227
what?

01:05:45.565 --> 01:05:47.362
No!

01:05:53.873 --> 01:05:56.808
I can still crush you!

01:06:03.717 --> 01:06:05.241
No!

01:06:18.465 --> 01:06:20.126
No!

01:07:48.588 --> 01:07:49.953
Sonia?

01:07:54.427 --> 01:07:56.156
I've got you.

01:08:04.471 --> 01:08:08.134
Maybe I should write the report
this time, huh, Bullock?

01:08:33.933 --> 01:08:37.198
For what it's worth,
the city's losing a good cop.

01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:39.337
Condoning vigilantes is one thing...

01:08:39.506 --> 01:08:42.475
...but even Com. Gordon
draws the line at employing them.

01:08:42.642 --> 01:08:45.236
we're just lucky the DA's
looking the other way.

01:08:45.412 --> 01:08:47.778
Someday you'll have to tell me
how you do it.

01:08:47.947 --> 01:08:50.142
How you keep from crossing the line.

01:08:50.316 --> 01:08:53.410
when I put on the mask,
I couldn't even see the line.

01:08:53.787 --> 01:08:58.587
-Maybe I don't take it as personally.
-Somehow I doubt that.

01:09:00.894 --> 01:09:03.488
-where will you go?
-I'm not sure.

01:09:03.662 --> 01:09:07.997
Someplace simpler, where capes
aren't the prevailing fashion.

01:09:08.167 --> 01:09:12.798
-Don't tell me you came to wish me luck.
-That, and to give you this.

01:09:12.971 --> 01:09:17.841
Exculpatory evidence that should help
release Dr. Ballantine's fiancé from jail.

01:09:18.011 --> 01:09:21.742
-I thought it should come from you.
-I-- Thank you.

01:09:21.915 --> 01:09:24.109
I'm sure she'll appreciate it.

01:09:29.889 --> 01:09:31.788
I think I'm gonna miss that.

01:09:34.828 --> 01:09:39.127
I hated who he was, what he did,
the hurt he brought to people.

01:09:39.299 --> 01:09:42.564
But now that he's in here, I feel bad.

01:09:42.734 --> 01:09:46.899
At least we talk. He's making a deal
to testify against Thorne and Penguin.

01:09:47.073 --> 01:09:50.133
Maybe he hated his life
as much as you hated yours.

01:09:50.477 --> 01:09:53.502
For a computer geek,
you're pretty smart.

01:09:54.214 --> 01:09:58.776
-By the way, how's Bruce?
-Mr. wayne? Fine, I guess.

01:09:58.952 --> 01:10:02.444
-You haven't heard from him?
-I think he's been reading the papers.

01:10:02.622 --> 01:10:04.453
Rocky!

01:10:05.124 --> 01:10:06.853
Rocky!

01:10:07.794 --> 01:10:09.318
Kevin!

01:10:10.196 --> 01:10:11.823
Kevin.

01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:18.832
Kevin.

01:10:36.422 --> 01:10:40.222
-About time I returned this.
-what are you doing here?

01:10:40.593 --> 01:10:44.689
Funny thing. This morning I got up
thinking, ''Something's wrong.''

01:10:44.864 --> 01:10:49.631
And then I realized: No gunfire,
no explosions, no goons out to do me in.

01:10:49.802 --> 01:10:52.236
Everything was peaceful and quiet.

01:10:52.405 --> 01:10:56.364
And that's when I realized
how much I missed you.

01:10:57.377 --> 01:11:02.280
You poor thing. But that was the old
Kathy Duquesne. The new one is different.

01:11:02.448 --> 01:11:05.747
She intends to live a life
of complete respectability.

01:11:05.919 --> 01:11:09.013
-All the time?
-Afraid so.

01:11:14.294 --> 01:11:17.593
well, maybe an explosion now and then.

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:41.589
