WEBVTT

00:00.033 --> 00:02.170
Previously on "Better Call Saul"...

00:02.505 --> 00:04.750
This was all you, start to finish.

00:05.550 --> 00:06.950
- Getting out?
- Yep.

00:07.820 --> 00:10.868
Perhaps we should
temper our expectations.

00:11.135 --> 00:11.990
You can call me Lalo.

00:12.943 --> 00:13.860
The Salamanca family.

00:13.918 --> 00:15.716
It's gonna be like I'm not even here.

00:15.718 --> 00:18.134
We're Way behind schedule
but the work is solid.

00:18.541 --> 00:20.575
- And Werner?
- I've got eyes on him.

00:20.981 --> 00:23.050
The thing that we did...
I mean, it was nuts.

00:23.054 --> 00:25.197
And I dumped it in your lap.

00:25.201 --> 00:28.050
I mean, I'm this close
to being reinstated.

00:28.100 --> 00:28.967
Let's do it again.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:50.750 --> 00:52.420
Excuse me.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.760
- May I help you?
- Oh, I really hope so.

00:55.920 --> 00:57.760
What can I do for you?

00:57.920 --> 01:01.090
My firm submitted plans
for Mesa Verde Bank...

01:01.260 --> 01:02.640
we're building a branch here.

01:02.800 --> 01:05.269
Sure, I think I saw that come through.

01:05.430 --> 01:08.810
As I was cleaning up,
refiling all our plans internally...

01:08.980 --> 01:12.110
I realized I was missing
one of the old versions.

01:12.270 --> 01:14.860
We had some late changes
to the conference room dimensions...

01:15.030 --> 01:16.820
so different versions floated around.

01:16.990 --> 01:19.240
Things got complicated, sorry.

01:20.360 --> 01:24.120
So long story short,
I think it's possible the wrong version...

01:24.280 --> 01:25.830
ended up in our proposal.

01:25.990 --> 01:27.580
- Oh, dear.
- Yeah.

01:27.750 --> 01:31.040
So I have the correct plans here...

01:31.210 --> 01:35.000
and I was hoping to just take a look
at the approved plans to compare them?

01:35.170 --> 01:36.760
- Just to make sure.
- Okay.

01:36.920 --> 01:38.420
But if they're wrong, you have to...

01:38.590 --> 01:40.720
Refile. Yeah, I know.

01:40.880 --> 01:42.890
I just wanna make sure
they're the wrong ones...

01:43.050 --> 01:45.760
before I get into it with my bosses.

01:45.930 --> 01:47.100
No problem.

01:47.270 --> 01:48.890
- Mesa Verde?
- Yes.

01:49.060 --> 01:52.600
- Do you have the address?
- 8783 Baylor Street.

01:52.770 --> 01:55.020
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

02:05.240 --> 02:07.080
Here we go.

02:09.870 --> 02:13.540
- Oh, I'll come around to you.
- Oh, good, thanks.

02:17.130 --> 02:18.880
Okay.

02:19.670 --> 02:22.550
Yup. Dates match. That's a good start.

02:23.430 --> 02:28.180
All right, conference room is
on sheet A 1.1.

02:32.270 --> 02:38.610
And room dimensions should
be 15-foot-6 by 12-foot-6.

02:38.780 --> 02:41.400
Fifteen-foot-six by 12-foot-6.

02:41.570 --> 02:42.700
Great.

02:42.860 --> 02:44.360
Break or sprain?

02:45.530 --> 02:46.910
Your foot.

02:47.080 --> 02:49.830
A sprain. I started trail running
a couple months ago.

02:49.990 --> 02:52.500
Went for a run last week,
wasn't paying attention...

02:52.660 --> 02:57.040
got my foot snagged in one of the roots.
Just twisted my ankle.

02:57.210 --> 03:00.800
Do you have a setback
for that conference room wall...

03:00.960 --> 03:03.630
at 2 feet, 10 inches?

03:03.800 --> 03:06.430
Yes, the wall is set back
2 feet, 10 inches.

03:06.590 --> 03:07.850
So far so good.

03:09.260 --> 03:12.850
It hasn't been that bad
except I have an 8-month-old, so...

03:13.020 --> 03:14.480
Oh, congratulations.

03:14.640 --> 03:15.850
Thanks.

03:16.020 --> 03:18.690
Been, you know,
kind of doing it on my own.

03:19.190 --> 03:21.570
My brother's been helping
since I'm a little limited.

03:21.730 --> 03:25.360
- Driving me around and whatnot.
- It's nice to have family around.

03:25.530 --> 03:28.370
Yeah, for the most part.

03:29.580 --> 03:31.870
He tries.
That's the important thing, right?

03:32.040 --> 03:33.410
- Yeah.
- Okay.

03:33.580 --> 03:35.370
I think these are the same.

03:35.960 --> 03:37.670
Am I missing anything?

03:44.720 --> 03:46.890
- They look the same to me.
- Great.

03:47.050 --> 03:49.220
- Yes!
- No refiling.

03:49.390 --> 03:52.640
Thank you. Thank you, Shirley. God.

03:52.810 --> 03:54.930
- You're welcome.
- You saved my life.

03:55.100 --> 03:58.270
I am telling you,
my bosses would've murdered me.

03:58.440 --> 03:59.860
I understand.

04:00.020 --> 04:02.150
You're the only person in charge
of organization...

04:02.320 --> 04:04.360
and suddenly
everything's your fault, right?

04:04.530 --> 04:07.280
I assume you would know
all about that.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.200
Yo, Lizzie.

04:09.370 --> 04:10.740
Bill?

04:11.080 --> 04:12.700
Where's Aidan?

04:12.870 --> 04:13.830
Hey, lady.

04:14.660 --> 04:17.670
He's fine. But he's very hungry.

04:17.829 --> 04:20.250
- And he's like a little eating machine.
- Bill. Bill.

04:20.420 --> 04:22.880
- Can you sniff this for me?
- Bill. Where is Aidan?

04:23.050 --> 04:24.590
He's fine. He's in the Wrangler.

04:24.760 --> 04:26.340
- Take a smell...
- What?

04:26.510 --> 04:29.720
- Because it's a little funky.
- You left my child in your Jeep?

04:29.890 --> 04:31.640
Yeah, I cracked the window.

04:31.800 --> 04:32.930
- Bill.
- Just... What?

04:33.100 --> 04:35.270
- Check this.
- Give me the keys. I'm not gonna check.

04:35.430 --> 04:37.020
- Where are you going?
- To get Aidan.

04:37.190 --> 04:40.520
You can't leave a baby in a car.
What the hell is wrong with you?

04:40.860 --> 04:42.610
Oh, man.

04:43.610 --> 04:45.650
- Go get the baby, Bill.
- What? What did I do?

04:45.820 --> 04:47.570
- Help her.
- It's only been a minute.

04:47.740 --> 04:49.660
I didn't know.

04:49.820 --> 04:51.320
Sorry.

04:52.450 --> 04:54.040
What am I supposed to do?

04:54.200 --> 04:58.120
You're supposed to watch a baby
for five minutes. How hard is that?

04:58.290 --> 05:01.170
Slow down, I'm wearing flip-flops.

05:12.470 --> 05:14.560
- How's Aidan?
- Oh, he's fine.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.810
He was only alone for a minute,
thank God. Wait.

05:17.980 --> 05:19.270
What happened?

05:19.440 --> 05:22.360
- Your milk. It kind of went everywhere.
- What?

05:22.520 --> 05:25.690
- What are you talk...?
- I am so sorry.

05:25.860 --> 05:29.240
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.450
- I... I...
- No, no, no!

05:31.610 --> 05:34.700
- Shirley, I can't show this to them.
- All right, all right.

05:34.870 --> 05:37.450
This is what we're gonna do.
This is what we're gonna do.

05:38.040 --> 05:39.870
You're gonna give me your copy...

05:40.040 --> 05:42.170
and I'll trade them out.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.210
Won't you get in trouble?

05:44.380 --> 05:46.800
They're exactly the same.
No one has to know.

05:46.960 --> 05:48.260
Are you sure?

05:48.420 --> 05:50.380
- Are you sure?
- Go on.

05:50.550 --> 05:52.840
- Okay. Okay.
- Get them.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.050
Okay. If you're sure.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.100
Okay.

05:59.810 --> 06:01.730
Thank you so much.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.610
Shirley...

06:04.480 --> 06:07.320
I can't tell you
how much this means to me, really.

06:07.480 --> 06:11.240
- You're a lifesaver.
- We need to stick together.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.320
Being a mom is hard enough.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.000
All right.

06:22.540 --> 06:24.040
All right.

06:24.210 --> 06:26.000
Let's make this official.

06:53.455 --> 06:55.625
We have returned, welcome back
to The Newlywed Game.

06:55.785 --> 06:58.585
Gentlemen, we've recorded
your predictions on cards on your laps.

06:58.745 --> 07:01.455
Remember, each time your prediction
matches your wife's answer...

07:01.625 --> 07:04.715
you get five points. The one couple
with the most points at the end...

07:04.875 --> 07:07.595
wins a great second honeymoon.
So, ladies, we are thrilled...

07:07.755 --> 07:10.015
you came back.
Your first question for five points.

07:10.175 --> 07:15.095
Tell me, ladies, if you were a boat,
does your husband think you've been...

07:15.265 --> 07:18.895
taking the most water lately,
on your stern...

07:19.065 --> 07:21.895
on your port side,
your starboard side...

07:22.065 --> 07:23.445
or on your bow?

07:23.605 --> 07:25.485
- Where you taking in that water?
- My stern.

07:25.655 --> 07:26.945
Oh, God.

07:27.115 --> 07:30.985
He said you've been taking
a lot of water in on your bow.

07:31.155 --> 07:33.865
- Bow?
- Top half's the bow?

07:34.035 --> 07:35.955
- Yeah, but...
- Okay.

07:40.585 --> 07:43.715
- Are you complaining?
- No, not at all.

07:43.875 --> 07:45.625
You don't like her bow?

07:45.795 --> 07:47.085
Uncle Hector...

07:48.345 --> 07:49.465
It's Lalo.

07:50.635 --> 07:52.135
You know me, don't you?

07:59.765 --> 08:00.815
One means "yes"?

08:01.435 --> 08:02.475
Nothing means "no."

08:06.945 --> 08:12.865
Who's got the biggest set of balls
north, south, east or west of Michoacan?

08:15.615 --> 08:17.165
Yes, indeed!

08:17.325 --> 08:19.495
I knew you were still in there.

08:23.085 --> 08:24.295
Uncle Hector.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.965
You know what I was thinking about
this morning?

08:33.554 --> 08:37.975
The smell of burning leather
and horsehair stuffing.

08:38.595 --> 08:40.225
Do you remember?

08:41.895 --> 08:43.184
Hotel Tulipan.

08:47.985 --> 08:51.065
You were so polite to that guy.

08:53.485 --> 08:55.195
And he turns his back on you?

08:56.955 --> 09:01.575
Makes that big deal
to show he's not scared.

09:05.335 --> 09:08.295
He was a professor
before he opened that place, remember?

09:08.465 --> 09:11.795
He'd always bring that up.
The big college professor.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.925
You took your time with him.

09:19.885 --> 09:23.145
And his wife listening from the side.

09:28.985 --> 09:33.525
That asshole was so proud
of his beautiful Spanish...

09:33.905 --> 09:37.825
his books, his antiques.

09:39.495 --> 09:42.455
But when it burned...

09:43.875 --> 09:45.495
it all smelled like shit.

09:50.335 --> 09:52.585
I never told you this, but...

09:53.885 --> 09:55.715
I went back inside.

09:56.805 --> 10:01.685
I went through the flames, the smoke.

10:02.475 --> 10:06.225
It was so hot,
the rubber on my shoes melted a little.

10:07.105 --> 10:10.025
Yes, I know it was very stupid, but...

10:10.985 --> 10:12.775
I'm sentimental.

10:14.315 --> 10:15.985
I wanted a souvenir.

10:17.485 --> 10:19.905
I kept it all these years.

10:20.495 --> 10:21.825
I brought it.

10:23.455 --> 10:25.075
Do you want to see it?

10:44.095 --> 10:46.475
Brings back memories, yes?

10:47.895 --> 10:53.065
Remember that guy hitting this,
calling for his bellboy?

10:56.365 --> 11:01.615
And you? Teaching the teacher!

11:02.705 --> 11:04.165
There you go, Uncle.

11:05.205 --> 11:06.285
Perfect.

11:06.455 --> 11:07.955
Give it a try.

11:13.835 --> 11:15.085
Again, Uncle.

11:16.005 --> 11:17.045
That's it!

11:17.545 --> 11:18.595
Again!

11:28.895 --> 11:31.355
That's a Salamanca!

11:49.125 --> 11:52.665
Hey, why don't you go get some Jell-O?

12:02.675 --> 12:05.095
Uncle, let's talk about the Chilean.

12:41.425 --> 12:45.175
Same old Hector.
Just wants to kill everybody.

12:49.145 --> 12:51.305
The biggest pancake
is not the best pancake.

12:51.475 --> 12:55.065
Or they would call it "the best pancake
that happens to be the biggest."

12:55.225 --> 12:57.315
- Top off?
- But, no, it's the...

12:57.485 --> 13:00.065
- Thank you.
- Can I get y'all anything else?

13:00.235 --> 13:01.865
- No.
- We're good, thanks.

13:02.025 --> 13:05.035
- You don't want a whole other burger?
- Whenever you're ready. No rush.

13:05.195 --> 13:07.205
Okay, thanks.

13:07.705 --> 13:09.785
You better take it easy with that stuff.

13:10.535 --> 13:13.165
We've still got at least
an hour on the road.

13:13.335 --> 13:14.375
Gotta stay awake.

13:14.545 --> 13:17.915
Yeah, but you gotta be able to sleep
when we get home too.

13:18.085 --> 13:20.335
- What time's your hearing?
- Eleven.

13:20.505 --> 13:24.345
This time next week, I will once again
be James McGill, Esquire.

13:24.505 --> 13:26.595
Yes.

13:29.595 --> 13:31.685
And I already got a jump
on my new practice.

13:31.845 --> 13:33.895
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

13:34.065 --> 13:36.475
Unexpected bonus
of the drop-phone business.

13:36.645 --> 13:38.695
It turns out,
it's great for client development.

13:39.105 --> 13:41.105
Yes, I guess that's true.

13:41.275 --> 13:43.865
Sooner or later,
every last one of those idiots...

13:44.025 --> 13:45.785
is gonna need an attorney.

13:48.075 --> 13:50.205
Of course, they all know me
as Saul Goodman.

13:50.365 --> 13:52.285
That's just details.

13:55.705 --> 13:59.255
Gotta say, a lot of people
are gonna be begging...

13:59.415 --> 14:01.295
for the old "Huell Babineaux" treatment.

14:01.465 --> 14:02.675
What's that?

14:03.885 --> 14:07.715
Our powers combined.

14:08.305 --> 14:14.475
People would pay top dollar for us to
undo a potentially life-ruining sentence.

14:15.395 --> 14:18.525
I think we should only use
our powers for good.

14:18.685 --> 14:22.485
What are we considering good
as of 9:06 p.m. tonight?

14:22.655 --> 14:24.815
You know what?
It's like Potter Stewart said...

14:24.985 --> 14:26.985
we'll know it when we see it.

14:35.205 --> 14:39.545
We just drove 300 miles
to scam Lubbock, Texas...

14:39.705 --> 14:42.875
so that your client can have
a 13-percent-bigger bank branch.

14:43.045 --> 14:46.135
Don't get me wrong,
I loved every second of it...

14:46.295 --> 14:49.305
but how is that using our powers
for good?

14:59.105 --> 15:01.235
Okay, fine.

15:01.815 --> 15:05.105
Yeah, "We'll know it when we see it."
I like it.

15:05.275 --> 15:07.155
It's a plan I can get behind.

15:50.575 --> 15:51.615
Okay.

16:39.375 --> 16:40.665
I'm in position.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.045
We're almost ready here. Stand by.

16:44.455 --> 16:46.125
Copy.

16:56.475 --> 16:57.635
What's up?

16:58.305 --> 17:01.805
My apologies.
We have a small problem.

17:01.975 --> 17:03.015
How small?

17:03.185 --> 17:04.435
A red light.

17:04.605 --> 17:06.984
It means there's no...

17:07.145 --> 17:10.905
How do you say...?
Continuity in the circuit...

17:11.065 --> 17:12.905
of one of the three charges.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.444
The orange one.

17:14.615 --> 17:17.365
There may be a loose or faulty wire.

17:17.994 --> 17:20.244
I'll go in and check.

17:20.415 --> 17:22.994
I thought you were the demolition expert.

17:23.585 --> 17:25.454
It's my job, Michael.

17:34.135 --> 17:35.175
Stand by.

17:36.265 --> 17:38.805
Copy. Standing by.

19:39.305 --> 19:40.635
Pull yourself together.

19:42.305 --> 19:44.475
Pull yourself together, you idiot.

20:54.955 --> 20:56.215
Try it now.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.585
I think we're ready here, Michael.

21:18.985 --> 21:20.355
All green.

21:21.315 --> 21:22.865
We're good here.

21:23.485 --> 21:24.535
Ready.

21:24.695 --> 21:26.745
Go. Call it.

21:26.905 --> 21:28.325
On the go.

22:18.125 --> 22:19.795
Five...

22:19.965 --> 22:21.175
four...

22:21.675 --> 22:22.755
three...

22:23.545 --> 22:25.175
two...

22:25.345 --> 22:26.805
one.

22:26.965 --> 22:28.095
Now!

22:37.855 --> 22:39.485
That's how it's done.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.465
Oh, wait. We're missing one.

23:01.625 --> 23:03.755
We're missing one.

23:04.635 --> 23:06.055
No, no, no, I'm good.

23:06.215 --> 23:08.095
- Thank you.
- No, we don't accept this.

23:08.265 --> 23:10.845
You can't be always on duty, Mike.

23:11.015 --> 23:15.685
Mike, Mike, Mike.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.225
Good job.

23:47.505 --> 23:49.635
What's on your mind?

23:51.635 --> 23:53.725
Nothing, really.

23:54.645 --> 23:57.475
I'm pleased the blasting went well.

23:57.645 --> 24:02.815
No damage to the structure,
no unforeseen incidents.

24:03.445 --> 24:05.445
You don't seem pleased.

24:05.605 --> 24:07.575
I'm just tired.

24:09.735 --> 24:11.995
I need to know what's going on.

24:12.155 --> 24:14.665
Nothing is going on.

24:19.455 --> 24:22.165
This work is taking longer
than I estimated.

24:22.335 --> 24:25.005
- It is.
- And I appreciate the R and R.

24:25.175 --> 24:28.385
The boys, they had fun.

24:28.755 --> 24:30.385
But I'm...

24:37.265 --> 24:38.515
Michael...

24:39.565 --> 24:40.895
you were married?

24:41.475 --> 24:43.935
- I was.
- How long?

24:44.485 --> 24:45.775
Twenty-two years.

24:45.945 --> 24:47.405
Perhaps you will understand.

24:47.565 --> 24:49.115
Twenty-six in April.

24:49.275 --> 24:51.325
Congratulations.

24:51.485 --> 24:53.405
My wife.

24:54.535 --> 24:56.165
I'm...

24:59.955 --> 25:00.995
I'm...

25:01.165 --> 25:03.625
Without her, I'm ad...

25:03.795 --> 25:05.915
- Adrift.
- Yeah, adrift without her.

25:06.085 --> 25:09.505
- You've been away before.
- Yes, of course. Not like this.

25:09.675 --> 25:12.255
I finish what I've started,
no question of that.

25:13.175 --> 25:17.015
Still, I can't help but wonder...

25:17.725 --> 25:19.145
No, of course not.

25:19.305 --> 25:21.265
- What?
- It's impossible.

25:21.855 --> 25:23.355
Although...

25:27.195 --> 25:32.735
Kai could supervise work until I get back.

25:32.905 --> 25:35.615
I don't wish to cause you hardship.

25:35.785 --> 25:39.705
Even though I'd only be gone
for four days.

25:39.875 --> 25:42.625
Five, maybe. Total.

25:42.795 --> 25:45.585
You're talking about flying
to Germany for a weekend?

25:45.755 --> 25:47.415
Just a quick trip.

25:48.925 --> 25:54.175
I could leave detailed instructions.

25:54.345 --> 25:56.635
The work would not be interrupted.

25:58.765 --> 26:00.185
You want to see your wife?

26:01.765 --> 26:03.685
More than anything.

26:03.855 --> 26:06.685
Then finish the job.

26:08.025 --> 26:09.145
Werner, you can do this.

26:09.315 --> 26:12.565
You put your head down
and you push your way through.

26:12.735 --> 26:15.985
When it's done,
from the money you've made here...

26:16.155 --> 26:18.955
you'll never be away
from your wife again.

26:20.205 --> 26:21.495
Of course.

26:22.875 --> 26:24.625
Of course, you're right.

26:24.795 --> 26:27.005
A flight of fancy.

26:29.215 --> 26:31.425
All right. I tell you what.

26:31.835 --> 26:35.555
We'll get you on the phone with her
for an extra call.

26:36.265 --> 26:38.345
We'll do it tomorrow.

26:39.935 --> 26:41.975
Thank you, my friend.

26:47.395 --> 26:49.525
You hang in there.

27:00.995 --> 27:02.365
Mr. Fring.

27:02.535 --> 27:03.875
Yes, Lyle?

27:04.415 --> 27:07.705
There's a man who just came in.

27:07.875 --> 27:12.215
And I know it's been a while,
but I was just, like, "He is so familiar."

27:12.505 --> 27:16.305
I think it's one of the guys
that made all the trouble last year.

27:16.885 --> 27:20.015
Not the main guy,
which is why I'm not totally sure.

27:20.845 --> 27:22.095
I see.

27:22.265 --> 27:23.685
He's not doing anything.

27:23.845 --> 27:27.605
He and the other guy ordered some food,
and they're just sitting.

27:27.775 --> 27:32.065
- But I thought you'd wanna know.
- Thank you, Lyle. I'll take care of it.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.215
Is everything to your liking?

27:55.385 --> 27:57.095
Are you kidding me?

27:57.255 --> 28:01.095
This is the best chicken I have ever had.

28:01.265 --> 28:03.595
Well, I am delighted to hear that.

28:03.765 --> 28:05.345
No, really, I'm serious. I mean...

28:05.515 --> 28:08.895
it's crispy, but it's not dried out.

28:09.065 --> 28:13.445
And the seasoning, it's so flavorful.

28:13.605 --> 28:16.275
Well, thank you.
Is there anything else I can do for you?

28:16.615 --> 28:19.485
Is there any chance...?

28:19.655 --> 28:22.285
And I know the answer is probably no.

28:22.995 --> 28:25.075
But is it possible for me
to meet the owner?

28:25.245 --> 28:26.875
I'm the owner.

28:27.035 --> 28:28.375
Really?

28:28.535 --> 28:30.995
How lucky for me.

28:31.375 --> 28:33.085
Would you be interested in franchising?

28:33.255 --> 28:35.835
Because I would be eager to invest.

28:36.005 --> 28:39.345
Well, perhaps we should go to my office,
where we can discuss it further.

28:39.505 --> 28:40.965
Excellent.

28:41.465 --> 28:44.095
- Don't waste that.
- This way.

28:46.895 --> 28:50.265
Now, what may I do for you, SeÃ±or...?

28:50.605 --> 28:55.695
Salamanca. Eduardo Salamanca.
But you can call me Lalo.

28:55.855 --> 28:57.865
And you're Gustavo Fring.

28:58.445 --> 29:01.235
I've been an admirer
of yours for many years.

29:01.615 --> 29:03.075
You have how many restaurants?

29:03.245 --> 29:05.575
- Seven.
- Seven.

29:05.745 --> 29:08.915
And starting from nothing.
That's incredible.

29:09.495 --> 29:11.035
What may I do for you?

29:11.995 --> 29:14.915
I come here on behalf
of my entire family...

29:15.085 --> 29:18.135
- to give you our deepest thanks.
- Well, for what?

29:18.295 --> 29:19.675
For what?

29:19.845 --> 29:21.845
For saving Don Hector's life.

29:22.005 --> 29:23.515
I just visited him.

29:23.675 --> 29:27.305
You know, seeing a man like that,
can't speak, can barely move...

29:27.725 --> 29:29.685
I wanted to weep.

29:30.305 --> 29:32.015
But it could have been worse.

29:32.185 --> 29:35.315
Varga tells me that while everyone else
was picking their asses...

29:35.485 --> 29:38.275
you rushed to him, struck him
on the chest and brought him back.

29:38.445 --> 29:40.525
It was a simple instinct.

29:40.695 --> 29:44.155
But still, with all the history
between you two...

29:44.325 --> 29:47.155
What you did was a gesture of peace.

29:47.325 --> 29:49.245
At least, that's how we see it.

29:49.415 --> 29:51.205
I'm very pleased to hear that.

29:53.165 --> 29:56.545
And here we are getting along.

29:59.675 --> 30:04.345
You ever think, maybe Don Eladio
is one shrewd bastard?

30:04.845 --> 30:07.885
Maybe he likes the bad blood
between us?

30:09.185 --> 30:15.275
He sits by his pool, baking in the sun,
giving orders.

30:16.685 --> 30:22.155
But your trucks move the product. And
Salamanca muscle keeps everyone in line.

30:22.695 --> 30:25.445
I don't consider that there's bad blood.

30:25.785 --> 30:26.905
Really?

30:28.785 --> 30:32.285
Still, if we were to get along too well...

30:32.455 --> 30:34.665
I'm sure Eladio wouldn't like that,
would he?

30:36.755 --> 30:38.965
I am satisfied
with the current arrangement.

30:40.425 --> 30:42.335
I'm just shitting you.

30:42.505 --> 30:45.385
You would be crazy
to go up against Eladio.

30:48.385 --> 30:50.935
Look, I'm gonna be in town for a while.

30:51.095 --> 30:53.645
So, you know, we'll talk some more.

30:54.055 --> 30:55.265
We owe you.

30:55.435 --> 30:57.525
If you need a favor...

30:57.685 --> 31:00.815
- I'm your man.
- Same. Naturally.

31:01.235 --> 31:03.065
Oh, and I'll be back for that chicken.

31:03.235 --> 31:05.445
It's too tasty to stay away from.

31:32.975 --> 31:35.105
You say you pick up six keys a week?

31:35.265 --> 31:36.765
Yeah.

31:37.815 --> 31:42.275
- Where?
- He's got a chicken farm way out of town.

31:44.275 --> 31:45.315
Show me.

32:27.070 --> 32:28.860
Mr. McGill?
We're ready for you now.

32:29.030 --> 32:29.990
Great.

32:32.240 --> 32:36.540
And it looks like you've completed
the Pre-Prosecution Diversion Program?

32:36.710 --> 32:38.670
That's right.
Three and a half weeks ago.

32:38.830 --> 32:41.080
I believe if you look
at the supplemental materials...

32:41.250 --> 32:44.710
there's a letter from my supervisor,
Brad Markham.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.470
Good.

32:48.130 --> 32:50.970
He says he was impressed
with your commitment.

32:51.140 --> 32:54.140
And for most of last year,
you've been employed at CC Mobile?

32:54.310 --> 32:55.430
It's a cell phone store.

32:55.600 --> 32:59.100
And, again, there's a letter
from my manager, Mr. Robert Finn.

32:59.270 --> 33:02.730
It's also in the supplemental materials.

33:03.860 --> 33:07.280
Says here you were part of something
called the Silver Circle?

33:07.440 --> 33:10.320
- Three months in a row?
- It's a sales award.

33:10.490 --> 33:13.530
Mr. Finn and the people at CC Mobile
have been very generous.

33:13.700 --> 33:17.120
You don't have to sell many phones
to get in the Silver, believe me.

33:17.290 --> 33:19.710
What made you choose
that particular field?

33:19.870 --> 33:22.750
Honestly? Just to put bread on the table.

33:22.920 --> 33:27.460
But I would say it's given me
a new outlook on client relations.

33:27.630 --> 33:32.220
After dealing with cell phone contracts,
explaining statutes to my clients...

33:32.390 --> 33:34.510
should be a cakewalk.

33:35.220 --> 33:38.430
As the saying goes,
"The law is constantly changing."

33:38.600 --> 33:42.190
Have you been keeping yourself
apprised of the latest developments?

33:42.350 --> 33:44.440
I've been reading the Bar Journal.

33:44.610 --> 33:47.820
What caught my eye recently
was Crawford v. Washington.

33:47.980 --> 33:49.110
Any of you follow that?

33:49.280 --> 33:52.570
It has to do with the admissibility
of ex parte examinations.

33:52.740 --> 33:55.370
- That was a Supreme Court case?
- That's right.

33:55.530 --> 33:59.750
How did it go? "The only indicium
of reliability sufficient to satisfy...

33:59.910 --> 34:02.290
constitutional demands
is the one the Constitution...

34:02.460 --> 34:05.420
actually prescribes: Confrontation."

34:05.590 --> 34:07.590
It's classic Scalia.

34:07.960 --> 34:11.840
I can't help but think about victims forced
to confront their assailants in open court.

34:12.010 --> 34:16.600
But on the other hand, the Sixth
Amendment is pretty controlling...

34:17.469 --> 34:19.100
I'm sorry. I just...

34:19.270 --> 34:21.770
I get rolling on constitutional questions.

34:21.940 --> 34:26.060
Short answer,
I've been doing my level best.

34:27.610 --> 34:31.320
Mr. McGill, is there anything you'd like
to tell us about the reasons...

34:31.489 --> 34:33.449
you were suspended
in the first place?

34:33.989 --> 34:38.620
This past year, that's pretty much
been the only thing on my mind.

34:38.790 --> 34:44.540
And I'm humbled by the sheer stupidity
of my actions.

34:45.040 --> 34:47.380
Remorse doesn't begin to cover it.

34:47.540 --> 34:50.880
I'm not gonna make excuses,
because there's no excuse for what I did.

34:51.050 --> 34:54.300
But as I sit here, I can assure you...

34:54.469 --> 34:58.310
nothing like that
will ever happen again.

34:58.680 --> 35:00.180
Never.

35:02.230 --> 35:06.270
Well, all right.
That would seem to be satisfactory.

35:06.690 --> 35:08.940
Meg? You have something?

35:09.980 --> 35:13.740
Mr. McGill,
what does the law mean to you?

35:17.200 --> 35:19.120
The law?

35:22.370 --> 35:25.170
Yeah. Okay.

35:31.500 --> 35:33.260
Listen, growing up...

35:33.420 --> 35:37.890
becoming a lawyer was the last thing
on my mind.

35:38.390 --> 35:42.720
Even if I wanted to,
I didn't have the smarts or the skills...

35:42.890 --> 35:45.350
or the "stick-to-it-iveness."

35:45.520 --> 35:49.900
But I happened to get a job
with some attorneys...

35:50.070 --> 35:54.150
and I couldn't help but think,
"Maybe I could do that?"

35:54.320 --> 35:58.910
And something inside me
made me wanna try.

35:59.370 --> 36:00.700
Now, listen:

36:00.870 --> 36:05.410
My diploma says the University
of American Samoa Law School.

36:05.580 --> 36:09.630
And that's exactly what it sounds like,
that's a correspondence school.

36:09.790 --> 36:12.670
I wish it said Georgetown...

36:12.840 --> 36:14.460
or Northwestern.

36:14.630 --> 36:18.430
But UAS was the only one
that would take me.

36:18.970 --> 36:22.970
Because, let me tell you,
I wasn't a natural.

36:23.140 --> 36:27.890
I mean, the classes,
the studying, trying to pass the bar?

36:28.060 --> 36:29.270
Practically killed me.

36:29.440 --> 36:32.570
I must have quit 10 or 12 times...

36:32.730 --> 36:36.700
but I kept coming back to it.
And I'm really glad I did.

36:36.860 --> 36:40.370
Because when I got to work
with actual clients...

36:40.530 --> 36:43.280
there was nothing else like it.

36:43.700 --> 36:47.710
Our legal system is complicated,
and sometimes it could feel capricious...

36:47.870 --> 36:51.670
but it's the closest thing
to real justice that we've got.

36:51.840 --> 36:57.420
And for it to work, it needs vigorous,
passionate advocates.

36:57.590 --> 36:59.970
Helping my clients, you know...

37:00.140 --> 37:02.600
arguing on their behalf...

37:02.760 --> 37:05.810
that's the best thing I've ever done.

37:07.020 --> 37:09.230
And this past year...

37:10.150 --> 37:12.310
I've missed the hell out of it.

37:19.990 --> 37:22.240
That was very eloquent.

37:24.410 --> 37:29.120
Was there any particular influence
on your views?

37:33.750 --> 37:36.050
Credit where credit is due.

37:37.380 --> 37:40.050
The University of American Samoa.

37:40.760 --> 37:43.050
Go, Land Crabs.

37:48.640 --> 37:49.680
Anything else?

37:50.140 --> 37:52.520
- No. Thank you.
- No. Good?

37:52.850 --> 37:55.400
I think we have everything we need.

37:55.570 --> 37:59.070
You'll be getting a letter
with our decision in the next few days.

37:59.690 --> 38:01.150
All right.

38:01.820 --> 38:04.620
Thanks for your time. All of you.

38:32.230 --> 38:36.770
- I thought he was right up there.
- Yeah, he's part of the review process.

38:36.940 --> 38:38.900
You've worked with him before.
Good guy?

38:39.070 --> 38:41.190
Yeah. Really good guy.

38:44.950 --> 38:47.200
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

38:47.370 --> 38:48.540
- Mr. McGill.
- Yes.

38:48.700 --> 38:51.870
I know they said I'd hear from them,
but just between you and me...

38:52.040 --> 38:53.500
what'd they decide?

38:57.920 --> 38:59.590
You've got to be kidding me.

38:59.750 --> 39:01.090
No. No.

39:01.260 --> 39:03.300
No, no, no.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.340
No!

39:12.430 --> 39:13.770
Hey. Wait a minute.

39:13.940 --> 39:15.650
Wait. You're denying me?

39:15.810 --> 39:19.190
- What did I do wrong?
- Mr. McGill, this is not the place.

39:19.360 --> 39:21.690
I did everything right. Please tell me.

39:23.150 --> 39:24.530
Look.

39:24.900 --> 39:26.240
These decisions are never easy.

39:26.410 --> 39:28.700
Okay, come on, I deserve an answer.

39:31.410 --> 39:33.540
- Please.
- Mr. McGill, I can't...

39:33.710 --> 39:36.210
I did everything right.

39:38.210 --> 39:40.920
It was a question of sincerity.

39:41.090 --> 39:42.760
A what?

39:45.380 --> 39:51.180
Some members of the committee
found you somewhat insincere.

39:53.060 --> 39:55.440
You're free to apply again next year.

40:14.580 --> 40:16.620
- Hey, Mike.
- Hey.

40:18.210 --> 40:21.170
Well, how goes it
with the Dirty Half-Dozen?

40:21.340 --> 40:22.630
Playing volleyball.

40:22.800 --> 40:25.090
That guy Kai cheats.

40:26.880 --> 40:28.800
Werner's still talking?

40:28.970 --> 40:32.060
They've been saying goodbye
for about 20 minutes now.

40:32.220 --> 40:34.230
Anything of note?

40:34.560 --> 40:38.310
They got a new puppy
and it's peeing everywhere.

40:39.360 --> 40:42.690
The dog, the house. Her back's acting up
so they wanna go to the springs...

40:42.860 --> 40:45.700
- at Baden-Baden once he gets back.
- So like the usual.

40:45.860 --> 40:46.820
Yup.

40:47.570 --> 40:50.990
Been at it almost an hour and a half.
Want me to give a 10-minute warning?

40:51.870 --> 40:55.620
No. Let him go on
as long as he wants.

40:55.790 --> 40:57.000
Wait, okay.

40:57.170 --> 40:59.040
They're wrapping up.

40:59.210 --> 41:01.420
She's gotta get to book club.

41:03.750 --> 41:06.300
I'm gonna check the perimeter.

42:12.070 --> 42:14.740
We have no problem
with that language and will adjust.

42:14.910 --> 42:17.830
We do have a concern
on page 15, clause 4B.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.660
Third paragraph. Begins:

42:19.830 --> 42:24.170
"The right to indemnification,
payment, reimbursement."

42:24.340 --> 42:26.210
- Everyone with me?
- Yes, I see it.

42:26.380 --> 42:29.170
This is clearly
a pro-sandbagging clause.

42:29.340 --> 42:31.680
Troy, it simply gives us the right
to indemnification...

42:31.840 --> 42:34.680
- for breaches of representations.
- Of which there are none.

42:34.850 --> 42:38.060
We feel it's necessary given the fast pace
of the negotiations thus far...

42:38.220 --> 42:40.560
and the lack of time
to complete due diligence.

42:40.730 --> 42:42.400
Mesa Verde set the pace here.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.610
Further, you're overstepping by
requiring parts of the target payment...

42:45.770 --> 42:47.940
- be put aside as collateral.
- Kim Wexler here.

42:48.110 --> 42:50.860
If I may respectfully remind you,
Mesa Verde is allowing you...

42:51.030 --> 42:54.320
to keep a clause that warranty breaches
must be "in a material respect."

42:54.490 --> 42:55.620
It's standard language.

42:55.780 --> 42:57.660
Yeah. As is ours.

42:57.830 --> 43:00.410
Come on, guys, meet me halfway here.

43:00.580 --> 43:03.580
Fine. Then we'd like to discuss
how we're defining "knowledge"...

43:03.750 --> 43:05.880
- within the contract.
- Be my guest.

43:06.040 --> 43:08.710
We feel that what we've established
is pretty reasonable.

43:08.880 --> 43:11.170
- Our clients would like to propose...
- Hey there.

43:11.340 --> 43:13.630
"To the best
of the seller's knowledge."

43:13.800 --> 43:16.470
- Slow down. Slow down.
- Fine. You have to give us a chance...

43:46.420 --> 43:48.340
Insincere! Insincere!

43:48.500 --> 43:50.170
- Jimmy, what happened?
- A goddamn year.

43:50.340 --> 43:52.300
- What am I supposed to do for a year?
- Jimmy.

43:52.470 --> 43:55.470
Guarantee I'm not selling phones
for a fucking year, I'll tell you that.

43:55.640 --> 43:57.390
What did they say exactly?
How did they...?

43:57.550 --> 43:58.600
Hard pass.

43:58.760 --> 44:00.510
- All right.
- Don't tell me I can appeal...

44:00.680 --> 44:03.480
because once the board hears
the word "insincere," I'm screwed.

44:03.640 --> 44:05.690
How do you disprove insincere?

44:05.850 --> 44:09.400
Jimmy, just take a breath
and start from the beginning. Please.

44:09.860 --> 44:11.780
I was good, Kim.

44:11.940 --> 44:14.490
I mean, I wasn't stuck-up,
but I knew my shit.

44:14.650 --> 44:17.370
Right? "What have you been doing
during your suspension?"

44:17.530 --> 44:19.870
And "have you been keeping up
with the law?"

44:20.030 --> 44:24.580
All fine. And then one, out of nowhere,
comes up with this weird-ass question.

44:24.750 --> 44:26.920
"What does the law mean to you?"

44:27.080 --> 44:30.000
- That's a big one.
- Huge. And I nailed it.

44:30.170 --> 44:33.510
I talked about the meaning of the law
and I was down-to-earth...

44:33.670 --> 44:35.760
and I was humble, I was sincere.

44:35.930 --> 44:37.300
And they loved it.

44:37.970 --> 44:40.890
- So...?
- So they turned me down.

44:42.600 --> 44:44.480
Well, there has to be more to it than that.

44:45.180 --> 44:47.020
There's not.

44:48.020 --> 44:50.900
I don't... What did they say
when you talked about Chuck?

44:51.690 --> 44:54.740
What does Chuck have to do with this?
What?

44:54.900 --> 44:56.400
So you didn't even...?

44:56.570 --> 44:57.950
Why would I?

45:01.910 --> 45:03.450
Okay.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.790
Okay, listen, we will figure this out.

45:06.960 --> 45:09.500
- And, yes, you will appeal.
- They're gonna rubber-stamp...

45:09.670 --> 45:12.210
We won't let them. We'll find a way
to make you look sincere.

45:12.380 --> 45:14.590
Kim, I was sincere.

45:14.760 --> 45:16.090
I know that. I meant...

45:16.260 --> 45:18.720
I might have been a little corny,
but I meant every word.

45:18.880 --> 45:20.300
I know that.

45:22.390 --> 45:23.640
You don't believe me.

45:24.270 --> 45:27.020
- Of course I do.
- Jesus, it's right there on your face.

45:27.180 --> 45:29.600
You think I'm some kind of lowlife,
some kind of asshole.

45:29.770 --> 45:31.860
- What?
- The kind of lawyer guilty people hire.

45:32.020 --> 45:34.780
- Jimmy, that's not...
- You look at me and see Slippin' Jimmy.

45:34.940 --> 45:37.860
- I never said that.
- Yeah, but you thought it.

45:39.610 --> 45:42.620
You wanna know why
the committee called you insincere?

45:42.780 --> 45:44.540
Because you didn't mention Chuck.

45:44.910 --> 45:46.120
What does that have to...?

45:46.290 --> 45:48.500
They read the transcripts,
they know what happened.

45:48.660 --> 45:50.710
They waited for you
to say something about him.

45:50.880 --> 45:53.290
I'm supposed to make a hairy deal
about my dead brother...

45:53.460 --> 45:55.460
at my reinstatement hearing?

45:55.630 --> 45:56.960
How is that sincere?

45:57.420 --> 45:59.180
I don't think about Chuck.

45:59.340 --> 46:01.340
Okay? I don't miss Chuck.

46:01.510 --> 46:04.810
Chuck was alive, and now he's dead,
and that's that.

46:04.970 --> 46:06.640
Life goes on. So sue me.

46:07.350 --> 46:08.520
See, there it is again.

46:09.730 --> 46:11.310
That's why we don't have an office.

46:11.480 --> 46:12.610
What? No.

46:12.770 --> 46:14.520
Do not start in on that office.

46:14.690 --> 46:17.150
I don't wanna hear another word
about that stupid office.

46:17.320 --> 46:19.070
Stupid office? Okay, here we go.

46:19.240 --> 46:22.240
Jimmy, I have been on your side
since the day we met.

46:22.410 --> 46:24.830
Who comes running when you call?

46:24.990 --> 46:26.910
Who cleans up your messes?

46:27.080 --> 46:31.580
I have a job, but I drop everything
for you. Every single time.

46:31.750 --> 46:34.540
You confess to a felony on tape,
I'm there.

46:34.710 --> 46:36.880
You have a bar hearing,
I represent you.

46:37.050 --> 46:41.090
Over and over again,
if you need me, I'm there.

46:41.260 --> 46:45.600
But in your mind, the only measure
of my feelings for you is some office?

46:45.760 --> 46:49.850
I'm good to live with, sleep with, but God
forbid you should have an office with me.

46:50.020 --> 46:52.810
- What are you...? I just told you...
- You get bored with your life...

46:52.980 --> 46:55.310
so you come roll around in the dirt,
have some fun...

46:55.480 --> 46:57.320
- with Slippin' Jimmy, then back up.
- Fun?

46:57.480 --> 47:00.320
Fun like lying to the ADA
to get your friend out of the shitter?

47:00.490 --> 47:03.280
Fun like standing there
with a smile plastered on my face...

47:03.450 --> 47:05.700
while you play mind games
on my law partner?

47:05.870 --> 47:09.450
Oh, what a mistake it was
to take me up to your office in the sky.

47:09.620 --> 47:11.620
- You'll never do that again.
- Maybe I won't.

47:11.790 --> 47:13.540
Maybe next time you call, I won't come.

47:13.710 --> 47:16.090
There you go.
Kick a man when he's down.

47:17.880 --> 47:20.710
Jimmy, you are always down.

49:47.070 --> 49:49.240
I messed it all up.

50:04.210 --> 50:06.380
You still want to be a lawyer?

50:11.600 --> 50:13.100
Yeah.

50:16.310 --> 50:18.480
Well, we can start with that.

50:39.500 --> 50:40.870
Hey, Mike.

50:41.040 --> 50:42.500
Hey.

50:45.420 --> 50:46.920
Thanks.

50:50.550 --> 50:54.050
- Thank you, sir.
- So, what do we got?

50:54.220 --> 50:55.680
It's pretty quiet.

50:55.850 --> 50:57.350
Kai was up late again.

50:57.520 --> 51:00.980
About an hour after he went down,
Werner came out for a couple minutes.

51:01.140 --> 51:06.900
Then Casper was up around 2:30,
watched some TV, headed back in.

51:09.190 --> 51:10.950
What's going on with six?

51:13.370 --> 51:15.740
There. What is that?

51:16.240 --> 51:17.830
Oh, yeah.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.500
- Dead pixels.
- Wasn't there yesterday.

51:20.660 --> 51:22.460
Had a voltage spike earlier.

51:22.620 --> 51:25.670
Camera flared for about 20 seconds,
but it came right back.

51:25.840 --> 51:27.960
A voltage spike?

51:28.880 --> 51:31.010
Any of the other cameras do that?

51:35.930 --> 51:38.020
Yeah, 10.

51:43.520 --> 51:45.770
Show me the outside cameras.

51:56.450 --> 51:57.990
You, let's go.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.790
Get the lights!

52:51.710 --> 52:52.760
Up there.

52:52.920 --> 52:54.380
You check that out.

52:54.550 --> 52:56.340
What's going on?

52:57.220 --> 52:58.680
Mike.
