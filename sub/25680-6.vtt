a different, beach-themed

00:09.968 --> 00:11.428
is a sustainable idea, right?

No, that can't be right.

it's amazing I've made it this long

To be honest,
I've only been using my backpack

01:07.567 --> 01:09.736
to cover up stains on my shirts.

01:09.819 --> 01:12.530
But you and I were
in the same chemistry class.

your final project. It was good.

we're best friends.

in your head like this,

you drive yourself crazy.

01:47.524 --> 01:48.441
This is just
summer school.

There's nothing
weird about it,

10:26.001 --> 10:28.169
with chemicals, not water, huh?

10:28.253 --> 10:29.170
-[gasps]
-[pops, bubbling]

10:30.338 --> 10:31.297
Uh-oh.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.052
Okay, so water doesn't do that.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.178
[explodes]

10:38.972 --> 10:40.265
And...

10:40.348 --> 10:43.059
chemistry!

10:45.395 --> 10:47.981
It's all real, Paige.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.232
Maybe you should go home.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.318
Guess I was wrong.

10:53.236 --> 10:54.988
I'm sorry, everybody.

10:55.447 --> 10:57.032
I'm sorry, Frankie.

11:02.037 --> 11:04.080
Geez, why did we ever
become friends with her?

11:05.081 --> 11:07.167
Call me later, Paige!

11:11.129 --> 11:13.173
Who does Zane think he is,

11:13.256 --> 11:15.884
saying we're not
unboxing material?

11:15.967 --> 11:18.178
I'm everything material!

11:19.095 --> 11:20.138
Hey, guys.

11:20.221 --> 11:23.391
Zane, why didn't you
put us on your channel?

11:23.475 --> 11:25.352
We did exactly
what you asked.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.270
We opened the boxes.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.980
You opened the boxes,

11:29.064 --> 11:32.108
but you didn't...
"open" the boxes.

11:32.192 --> 11:35.320
I get it. He's saying things twice
saying things twice.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.282
Anyone can open a box,

11:39.366 --> 11:42.118
but not everyone
can be an unboxer.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.286
It's no big deal.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.121
It's just something
you're not good at.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.207
That's the point!

11:47.290 --> 11:50.043
Amelia Duckworth
is good at everything,

11:50.126 --> 11:52.128
and if I'm not good
at unboxing,

11:52.212 --> 11:54.881
then that could lead
to me not being good at something else,

11:54.964 --> 11:59.344
then something else, then next thing you
know, I'm turning into...

11:59.427 --> 12:01.304
well, him.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.182
I was the him.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.354
We want to learn
how to be unboxers.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.482
Teach us, Zane.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.485
When you're making
an unboxing video,

12:15.568 --> 12:18.196
you can't just talk
like your normal self.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.198
You've gotta...

12:20.281 --> 12:21.449
add the drama.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.327
Okay, let me try.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.414
It's time to open...

12:30.333 --> 12:32.585
How do I know
if the dramatic pause is too long?

12:32.669 --> 12:35.088
Ahem.
It...

12:36.339 --> 12:38.049
was too long.

12:39.384 --> 12:43.138
Viewers love the surprise
of what's inside the box.

12:43.304 --> 12:46.266
When you gasp, they gasp.

12:46.349 --> 12:47.350
Watch.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.104
[gasping]

12:51.813 --> 12:53.314
Now, you try.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.317
[exhales deeply]

12:58.528 --> 13:00.196
Gasp!

13:01.448 --> 13:03.366
Okay, moving on.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.661
Storytelling is
everything.

13:06.745 --> 13:09.456
When I say go, remove your blindfold

13:09.539 --> 13:11.541
and tell a story
about what's in front of you.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.209
Go!

13:14.210 --> 13:15.462
Uh...
Uh...

13:15.545 --> 13:17.422
Once upon a time...

13:17.505 --> 13:20.050
lamp! The end!

13:20.133 --> 13:20.967
[clattering]

13:22.052 --> 13:24.220
I think I broke
whatever my thing was.

13:26.181 --> 13:29.100
Okay, guys,
you're not getting it yet,

13:29.184 --> 13:30.143
but let's keep trying.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.269
What's the point?

13:31.353 --> 13:33.938
You were right.
We're not unboxing material.

13:34.022 --> 13:36.232
-Guys, if you just keep trying--
-Zane!

13:36.316 --> 13:38.068
Just stop.

13:38.151 --> 13:41.404
You're an unboxer,
and we are not, sir.

13:41.488 --> 13:45.408
And if I weren't so sad, I would
congratulate myself on that sick rhyme.

13:49.746 --> 13:52.332
Remember, when we perform
this scene today,

13:52.415 --> 13:54.250
we have to make it
really convincing.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.379
Totally. If we want
anyone else to believe we have chemistry,

13:57.462 --> 14:00.215
then we need to believe
we have chemistry.

14:00.298 --> 14:01.508
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

14:03.593 --> 14:06.262
That was weird.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.352
Principal Karen?
What are you doing here?

14:12.435 --> 14:14.312
I thought Ms. Manino
was coming back today.

14:14.396 --> 14:16.356
She was supposed to,
but she needs more time

14:16.439 --> 14:19.984
to recover from her, um...
the...

14:20.068 --> 14:21.319
Nose surgery?

14:21.403 --> 14:23.238
Sure, that sounds right.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.532
Uh...

14:25.615 --> 14:27.325
Where is everyone?

14:27.409 --> 14:29.536
I decided to give
everyone a free period.

14:29.619 --> 14:31.287
But since you're here,

14:31.371 --> 14:35.417
we should spend the next hour
riffing on some viddie iddies.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.085
That's how I say
"video ideas" now.

14:37.168 --> 14:38.420
Do you like it?
I already don't like it.

14:38.503 --> 14:41.506
-Unless you like it!
-Uh...

14:41.589 --> 14:44.384
By the dubs,
check out this pic I posted last night.

14:44.467 --> 14:45.301
[laughs]
Get it?

14:47.178 --> 14:49.222
It's me with Bizaardvark.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.974
There's three of us,

14:51.057 --> 14:52.684
so it's Triz-aardvark.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.311
[laughing]
Isn't it trill?

14:55.395 --> 14:56.396
Do the kids still say "trill"?

14:56.479 --> 14:58.273
If not, that is way zonk.

14:58.356 --> 15:00.275
Start saying "zonk."

15:00.358 --> 15:01.317
Uh...

15:01.401 --> 15:03.361
Speaking of uh-mazing,

15:03.445 --> 15:06.406
I can't wait to show you
my comedy vision journal.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.533
It's in your locker.
I'll go get it.

15:10.577 --> 15:14.581
Actors, no Ms. Manino,
Trizaardvark?

15:14.664 --> 15:15.498
[gasps]

15:16.374 --> 15:17.542
Paige was right.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.502
Summer school is fake.

15:26.634 --> 15:27.469
[screams]

15:28.219 --> 15:29.554
Oh, good.
You're up.

15:31.306 --> 15:33.350
-Paige, you were right.
-About what?

15:33.433 --> 15:35.435
About everything!

15:36.519 --> 15:38.480
I apologize
for the crudeness of this model.

15:38.563 --> 15:40.273
I only had nine hours to build it

15:40.357 --> 15:41.483
and had to stay still
for two of them

15:41.566 --> 15:43.318
because you started to wake up.

15:47.364 --> 15:48.573
Why am I tied to the bed?

15:48.656 --> 15:50.283
I don't know.
You did it to me.

15:50.367 --> 15:51.618
It seemed like
what we were doing.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.500
What is all this?

15:58.583 --> 16:00.377
The truth, 3-D modelized.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.504
I know that's not a word,
but there wasn't a word

16:02.587 --> 16:04.297
for what this is,
so I made one up.

16:04.381 --> 16:06.216
I think it fits.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.426
Man, are you feeling okay?

16:08.510 --> 16:10.220
Never better, Paige.
Try to keep up.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.641
First, Ms. Manino was a no-show.

16:14.724 --> 16:17.477
Then, I find out
those kids are actors.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.397
Then, PK gets me alone
to pitch video ideas.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.648
Video ideas!

16:21.731 --> 16:23.441
I'm sorry.
Are we at the optometrist?

16:23.525 --> 16:25.527
Because my eyes
are wide open!

16:26.778 --> 16:27.737
What are you saying?

16:27.821 --> 16:29.572
I'm saying it's fake,
all of it.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.324
Summer school is fake!

16:31.408 --> 16:33.326
Yay, you agree with me.

16:33.410 --> 16:34.411
Now, you can stop going.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.579
Are you kidding?
It's just the tip of the iceberg.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.874
Iceberg? I wasn't told
there'd be an iceberg.

16:39.958 --> 16:43.586
We have to find out
what Principal Karen's master plan is.

16:44.421 --> 16:46.256
Follow me!

16:50.760 --> 16:53.596
If PK joins Bizaardvark,
our videos will suffer.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.349
Thus, we'll lose subscribers.
Thus, we'll get kicked off of Vuuugle.

16:56.433 --> 16:57.434
Thus, the Internet will hate us,

16:57.517 --> 16:59.978
and we'll be doomed to a lifetime
of social isolation!

17:03.523 --> 17:06.443
Oh, wow.
That looks so lonely.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.529
Wait. Why are we
in Zane and Rodney's room?

17:09.612 --> 17:12.407
This is a two-room conspiracy, Paige.
Follow me!

17:14.617 --> 17:15.660
For all we know,

17:15.744 --> 17:18.371
Principal Karen is building
her own rival Internet.

17:18.455 --> 17:21.458
[gasps] A rival Internet
which she'll force us to be a part of.

17:21.541 --> 17:25.295
Then she'll have what she wanted all
along, Bizaardvark to herself,

17:25.378 --> 17:27.297
all day erry-day.

17:28.631 --> 17:29.549
What are we gonna do?

17:29.632 --> 17:32.385
We give her
exactly what she wants.

17:33.428 --> 17:35.263
Frankie, I... I don't know
how to build a rival Internet.

17:35.347 --> 17:36.723
Not that!

17:37.724 --> 17:40.393
We invite Principal Karen
to join Bizaardvark.

17:40.477 --> 17:41.519
If she says yes,

17:41.603 --> 17:42.812
we'll get her to admit
summer school is fake,

17:42.896 --> 17:46.399
because the only reason she created summer
school is to join Bizaardvark.

17:46.483 --> 17:49.444
I have follow-up questions,
but I'm sure you'll explain on the way.

17:53.531 --> 17:55.700
I am still wearing pajamas!

18:00.663 --> 18:03.458
So, since bar soap
comes in a box,

18:03.541 --> 18:05.502
and I'm bad at box stuff,
I switched to body wash.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.629
Now, there are some things
I like about body wash,

18:07.712 --> 18:10.590
but a lot of stuff
I miss about bar soap.

18:10.674 --> 18:13.301
So, I had to make
the decision, and--

18:13.385 --> 18:15.595
I'll pay you $100
to stop talking.

18:18.890 --> 18:20.725
You guys, I need your help.

18:20.809 --> 18:23.603
I hurt my wrist
playing basketball,

18:23.687 --> 18:25.772
and I can't shoot
an unboxing video.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.607
I've never missed a post.

18:27.691 --> 18:28.983
Can you two fill in for me?

18:29.067 --> 18:31.444
Us? Seriously?

18:31.528 --> 18:34.739
You've seen us unbox.
It's a disaster.

18:34.823 --> 18:37.617
You're the only ones
who've gone through my training.

18:37.701 --> 18:41.538
Please, this is
a true unboxing emergency.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.873
That does sound
like a real thing.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.669
Okay, guys,
you can do this.

18:47.752 --> 18:49.379
Just remember
what I've taught you.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.381
And action!

18:51.840 --> 18:55.552
Hi, y'all, I'm Amelia.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.012
And I'm...

18:57.095 --> 19:02.392
Dramatic pause.
Two, three, four, five, six, seven...

19:02.475 --> 19:03.685
Bernie.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.478
[gasps]

19:05.979 --> 19:09.399
I intend to be surprised
by whatever is in here.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.608
And cut!

19:10.692 --> 19:12.527
[sighing]
I'm sorry, Zane,

19:12.610 --> 19:14.696
but I don't think
we can do this.

19:14.779 --> 19:15.822
Of course you can.

19:15.905 --> 19:18.700
I made something for you
during your training.

19:18.783 --> 19:21.578
You weren't ready then,
but you're ready now.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.829
Look under the table.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.877
[both] Dubbie glovies!

19:31.087 --> 19:33.506
Now, take us
on our journey.

19:33.590 --> 19:34.841
He really believes in us.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.426
Let's do this.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.428
-[cracking knuckles]
-For Zane!

19:39.637 --> 19:40.680
Action.

19:40.764 --> 19:44.893
Behold, a cardboard box
of mystery.

19:44.976 --> 19:49.647
But how does
one turn mystery into history?

19:49.731 --> 19:51.608
We unbox.

19:53.568 --> 19:56.613
And so, today's
unboxing adventure ends

19:56.696 --> 20:00.700
with this aerodynamic wonder.

20:01.659 --> 20:05.914
And what magnificent journey
will this glorious chopper go on?

20:05.997 --> 20:09.668
Let's just say the sky is the limit.

20:11.670 --> 20:12.629
And cut.

20:12.712 --> 20:13.880
-Yes!
-Whoo!

20:13.963 --> 20:14.756
-We did it!
-[laughing]

20:15.840 --> 20:18.718
Just like I knew you could.

20:20.637 --> 20:21.846
Wait a minute.

20:22.806 --> 20:24.766
I know what's
going on here.

20:24.849 --> 20:27.143
You faked that injury.

20:27.227 --> 20:28.770
You just wanted
to put us on the spot,

20:28.853 --> 20:31.690
so you could show us
what we were capable of.

20:31.773 --> 20:33.900
Oh, you sneaky, little guy,

20:33.983 --> 20:36.611
you really put one over on us, huh, buddy?

20:36.695 --> 20:37.529
[screaming]

20:37.862 --> 20:39.030
My hand!

20:42.909 --> 20:46.705
So maybe that was
a real injury.

20:46.788 --> 20:48.790
Yeah.

20:48.873 --> 20:50.834
Oh, well.
Free gloves.

20:54.504 --> 20:56.464
Why don't I trust atoms?

20:56.548 --> 20:59.718
Because they make up everything.

21:00.552 --> 21:04.597
[laughing] Just a little humes
with the chems, people.

21:05.640 --> 21:06.474
[dramatic music playing]

21:09.019 --> 21:11.813
Dramatic music?
Before lunch?

21:11.896 --> 21:13.732
To the hallway!

21:14.774 --> 21:15.734
[dramatic music crescendos]

21:17.193 --> 21:19.738
-Hey, guys, I'm Paige.
-I'm Frankie.

21:19.821 --> 21:20.780
[both]
And we're Bizaardvark!

21:22.699 --> 21:23.700
Or are we?

21:23.783 --> 21:24.617
[gasping]

21:25.785 --> 21:28.955
Today is the most important day
in Bizaardvark's history,

21:29.039 --> 21:33.418
because we have decided
to add... a third member.

21:33.501 --> 21:34.461
[squealing]

21:35.795 --> 21:37.589
Which begs the question...

21:37.672 --> 21:40.967
[both]
Who is number three?

21:42.719 --> 21:45.847
I could... That's my... I...

21:45.930 --> 21:46.973
Interested!

21:48.224 --> 21:51.686
It's...
Principal Karen!

21:51.770 --> 21:54.731
-[upbeat music playing]
-[laughing excitedly] That's me!

21:55.940 --> 21:57.567
Welcome to Bizaardvark.

21:57.650 --> 21:58.943
Here's your official jacket.

21:59.027 --> 22:01.780
And here is your official
rehearsal schedule.

22:01.863 --> 22:02.947
Well, would you look at that?

22:03.031 --> 22:05.075
Rehearsal starts right now.
Come on, PK.

22:05.158 --> 22:07.911
Well, I can't go.
I have to teach.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.079
It's my job.

22:09.162 --> 22:11.081
Oh, I mean, sure, it's your job,

22:11.164 --> 22:13.750
but is it really?

22:13.833 --> 22:14.834
Wink, wink.

22:14.918 --> 22:16.044
Yes, it is.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.839
Oh, look, Ms. Manino is here.

22:21.257 --> 22:23.593
Wait. Ms. Manino is real?

22:23.677 --> 22:25.804
Yeah, it's not like she's an actor
like the rest of these kids.

22:25.887 --> 22:28.223
Ah-ha!
So, they are all actors!

22:28.306 --> 22:29.849
Indeed we are.

22:29.933 --> 22:31.685
From the performing arts school

22:31.768 --> 22:33.853
that's being fumigated for the summer.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.941
They're doing <i>Death of a Salesman</i>
in the fall.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.652
Wait.

22:40.735 --> 22:42.946
So, summer school is real,

22:43.029 --> 22:44.906
and you are supposed to be here.

22:44.989 --> 22:47.701
Wait. What about
my chemistry final project?

22:47.784 --> 22:48.910
I distinctly remember doing that,

22:48.993 --> 22:51.705
because it was due
the same day we shot our...

22:52.872 --> 22:55.125
"Let's Get Ripped" video.

22:55.750 --> 22:58.003
<i>Welcome to the Bizaardvark</i>
<i>workout plan!</i>

22:58.086 --> 23:00.630
[both] <i>Let's get ripped!</i>

23:05.802 --> 23:09.097
[both grunting]

23:09.848 --> 23:11.891
Oh, no!

23:14.811 --> 23:18.064
Wait. I think I ripped up
my final project in that video too.

23:18.148 --> 23:19.816
Oh, yeah,
look at that.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.026
According to our records,

23:21.109 --> 23:23.111
you also should have been
enrolled in summer school.

23:23.194 --> 23:24.988
Great catch, Paige.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.073
Wait. What?

23:27.782 --> 23:29.951
Now, the three of us
can spend the whole summer

23:30.035 --> 23:31.911
in here practicing
for Bizaardvark.

23:31.995 --> 23:33.830
This is so zonk!

23:34.914 --> 23:35.749
[shutter clicking]

23:35.832 --> 23:38.752
Okay, plan B. You invite her to
sleep over. I'll get the rope.
