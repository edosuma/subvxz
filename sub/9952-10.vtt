00:08.634 --> 00:11.296
Evi tipped off the Rev about your file
on the troubled people.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.722
Why are you working with the Rev?

00:13.848 --> 00:15.679
They said that you were important.

00:15.892 --> 00:18.474
-Who's they? The Rev?
-He's one of them.

00:19.729 --> 00:20.969
Son of a bitch, it's them.

00:21.272 --> 00:23.888

or I will!

00:26.360 --> 00:28.942
I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Crocker.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.236
I don't understand any of this.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.033
I can provide the answers.

00:35.286 --> 00:37.493
But you're gonna have to prove to me
that you're worthy.

00:42.001 --> 00:43.411

00:46.339 --> 00:47.954
He's in the middle of all this.

01:06.943 --> 01:09.901
A family on a camping trip
discovered what state police have conﬁrmed

01:09.987 --> 01:12.774
as the remains of 20-year-old
Malia McClintock,

01:12.865 --> 01:15.857
the dental hygienist from Garvey
reported missing last week.

01:15.952 --> 01:18.113
The family of four,
who asked not to be identiﬁed,

01:18.329 --> 01:21.537
found Miss McClintock’s dismembered body
buried under a bed of leaves

01:21.624 --> 01:22.955
near the Scotts Lake camping area.

01:23.042 --> 01:24.122
Yeah, baby.

01:24.210 --> 01:27.623
Miss McClintock disappeared two weeks ago
after leaving a friend’s backyard ﬁsh fry.

01:27.922 --> 01:30.755
A statewide search and investigation
had produced few clues

01:30.841 --> 01:32.797
until yesterday’s grisly discovery.

01:32.885 --> 01:34.045

01:34.136 --> 01:36.593

the murder of Miss McClintock to be related

01:36.681 --> 01:39.343

up and down the central coast that have...

yet named a suspect in the case,

01:43.980 --> 01:46.266

questioning a sandy-haired white male...

160 pounds with a rose tattoo on his forearm.

a man ﬁtting that description

I'm getting a lot of stuff done. You?

02:50.338 --> 02:51.953
l didn'tjust go through a breakup.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.210
You did just get demoted,
there was anarchy at the police station,

02:55.301 --> 02:57.337
and the new police chief
died right in front of you.

02:57.928 --> 02:59.088
Yeah.

02:59.430 --> 03:00.761
But I didn't go through a breakup.

03:04.643 --> 03:07.510
This is definitely the guy
that I saw coming out of that store.

03:08.356 --> 03:10.187
He did not seem
like he had that kind of strength.

03:11.025 --> 03:13.607
Did you see anything else?
This guy's a serial killer.

03:13.986 --> 03:16.568
Nope. And tell me how that's possible.

TRUCKER: No. Look, I've seen a lot of things.

03:26.499 --> 03:28.330
This was not normal, believe me.

03:28.584 --> 03:31.291
I've seen black bears do worse.
You're a lucky man.

03:31.420 --> 03:32.876
(CHUCKLING) Don't think this was a bear.

03:33.255 --> 03:36.213
Pretty much guarantee it was.
lt's feeding season, and they're cranky.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.016
NATHAN: The boy's name is Rory Campbell.

03:52.608 --> 03:54.564
Waitress's kid goes to school with him.

03:55.152 --> 03:57.985
There's blood over by the shed
and there's blood here.

03:59.323 --> 04:01.985
-lt's probably his.
-We need to call his parents.

04:02.076 --> 04:04.283
She already did. Dad's on the way down.

04:10.459 --> 04:14.452
Guy chases Rory into the storage shed,
gets interrupted by our truck driver.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.203
Spikes him like a football.

04:16.424 --> 04:19.086
Then drags Rory into the woods
to finish what he started?

04:23.931 --> 04:25.137

04:29.186 --> 04:30.687
We're gonna have to search these woods.

a couple more people down here.

04:34.984 --> 04:38.021
Why? After last week,
who can we really trust?

04:38.863 --> 04:41.104
A case like this, it's procedure.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.780
Yeah, well, being locked
in our own police station

04:43.868 --> 04:45.699
and getting shot at, that was procedure.

04:46.370 --> 04:47.485
No.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.203
We gotta do things our way.

04:51.167 --> 04:52.873
From now on, Nathan,

04:54.545 --> 04:55.705
it's just you and me.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.332
This is Rory's.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.660
Is there any significance
to the stamp on the inside?

05:38.130 --> 05:39.836

05:40.299 --> 05:42.915
Look, a serial killer has got my son.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.759
Now where are the staties with the hounds?
Have they stopped for coffee?

05:45.846 --> 05:49.088
It's actually better for everyone involved
if we keep this investigation local.

05:49.517 --> 05:52.304
The man that was last seen with Rory,
there's a chance that he could be...

05:52.436 --> 05:53.471

05:53.604 --> 05:55.014

Now there's no way I'm sitting on my hands
while some twisted freak chases him down.

06:17.378 --> 06:18.538
I'm coming, too.

-I can manage the situation.

07:38.876 --> 07:40.867

27:41.577 --> 27:43.442
(BREATHING GRUFFLY)

27:50.878 --> 27:52.414
DAVE: The cabin is just a little further.

27:53.089 --> 27:55.626
The Rev's group
should get there shortly after we do.

27:57.969 --> 27:59.925
You made a fine choice joining us.

28:00.471 --> 28:01.802
It took a long time.

28:01.931 --> 28:03.262
I think you're right on both counts.

28:03.641 --> 28:06.599
As men, we're defined
by our moral boundaries.

28:07.270 --> 28:10.433
And if we allow them to be compromised
in even the smallest way,

28:12.108 --> 28:13.439
you live a false life.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.981
Some men never learn that.

28:18.573 --> 28:20.438
Well, I guess I've just got an old soul.

28:22.451 --> 28:24.066
You've been through a great deal.

28:24.787 --> 28:27.995
You and I gotta sit down and have
a long conversation after all this is over.

28:28.624 --> 28:32.333
You have the opportunity
to succeed in Haven.

28:32.628 --> 28:34.584
Where your father so tragically failed.

28:37.091 --> 28:38.501
Failed at what exactly?

28:40.344 --> 28:41.959
Saving our town.

28:44.432 --> 28:46.468
I believe it's your destiny, son.

28:48.853 --> 28:50.844
That's a conversation I look fonNard to.

28:52.273 --> 28:53.308
So do I.

29:04.493 --> 29:05.619
Hmm.

29:06.203 --> 29:07.329
(GROANS)

29:13.127 --> 29:14.492
(GRUNTING)

29:39.278 --> 29:42.065
Probably here at some point,
but impossible to know when.

29:42.531 --> 29:43.907
And where they are now.

29:45.534 --> 29:46.944
Rev's gone.

29:47.662 --> 29:49.778
He was behind me,
and then all of a sudden, he...

29:50.831 --> 29:51.957
He wasn't.

29:52.041 --> 29:54.202
-And you didn't hear anything?
-No.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.453
It's that thing.

29:55.544 --> 29:57.876
Bart went to the hospital,
so it snatched the Reverend instead.

29:58.589 --> 29:59.749
Some footprints over here.

30:00.383 --> 30:01.543
They head into the woods.

30:05.972 --> 30:07.087
Let's go.

30:10.851 --> 30:12.011
Wait.

30:12.395 --> 30:13.555
Wait, no.

30:13.813 --> 30:15.553
Those guys are wandering blind right now.

30:15.898 --> 30:17.934
How far is it
to the northeast corner of the park?

30:18.109 --> 30:19.315
Quarter of a mile, give or take.

30:19.694 --> 30:20.934
We're gonna need Frankie's help.

30:21.862 --> 30:22.988
We're gonna have to run for it.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.938
Someone needs to stay here
in case they double back.

30:26.867 --> 30:27.947
Vince, Dave?

30:28.744 --> 30:30.530
-Yeah, you got it.
-Okay.

30:51.392 --> 30:53.508
Thank God.
There's something wrong with Sophie.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.221
She's burning up.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.598
I think it's the hunger.
It's stronger than she is.

31:00.735 --> 31:02.521
(BREATHING GRUFFLY)

31:03.946 --> 31:05.186
She needs a doctor.

31:07.742 --> 31:10.358
Can't take her to a hospital.
Too many people and too much blood.

31:11.704 --> 31:12.864
I have a medical kit in the truck.

31:13.080 --> 31:14.456
Her body needs food.

31:14.957 --> 31:16.538
I'm not talking about another deer.

31:17.460 --> 31:20.418
Let me worry about that.
You help Nathan and Audrey.

31:24.717 --> 31:27.459
We're looking for Amelia.
We need your help, Frankie.

31:43.819 --> 31:45.070
You need to eat, Amelia.

31:45.613 --> 31:47.399
It's the only way
we're getting out of here alive.

31:53.829 --> 31:55.330
He was going to kill you.

31:57.166 --> 31:58.326
(BRANCHES SNAPPING IN DISTANCE)

31:58.918 --> 32:00.124
They're coming.

32:04.590 --> 32:05.670
(GROWLING)

32:14.183 --> 32:15.343
Sophie.

32:15.851 --> 32:17.432
Sophie, what's your favorite ballet?

32:17.520 --> 32:18.760
The Nutcracker.

32:18.854 --> 32:20.264
You gonna be Marie someday?

32:20.356 --> 32:22.096
I'm gonna be the prince.

32:22.817 --> 32:24.307
I like the prince, too.

32:24.985 --> 32:26.521
And the Sugar Plum Fairy.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.273
How do you know so much?

32:29.156 --> 32:30.362
My daughter loved ballet.

32:30.783 --> 32:32.193
What's her name?

32:34.036 --> 32:35.276
Lizzie.

32:36.205 --> 32:37.490
(GROANS)

32:47.049 --> 32:49.290
RORY: Help! Over here.

32:49.385 --> 32:51.125
Help! Help!

32:51.387 --> 32:53.298
Hey, I'm over here!

32:53.973 --> 32:55.213
It's Rory.

32:55.850 --> 32:57.556
RORY: Hey, over here!

32:57.893 --> 32:59.224
Ihearyou,Son.

32:59.812 --> 33:01.393
-Where are you?
-Help!

33:01.897 --> 33:04.229
-Where is it coming from?
-Over here! Help!

33:06.402 --> 33:07.642
I'm over here!

33:07.736 --> 33:08.862
This way.

33:09.405 --> 33:10.690
Over here!

33:10.906 --> 33:13.397
Hey, help! Over here!

33:13.534 --> 33:14.569
Help!

33:15.077 --> 33:16.192
Help!

33:16.579 --> 33:18.035
-Over here!
-|t's coming from over here.

33:19.331 --> 33:20.582
Help!

33:20.875 --> 33:22.081
Wait! Wait!

33:22.418 --> 33:24.579
Rory is that way,
but the blood's in the opposite direction.

33:26.422 --> 33:29.129
-Are you sure?
-I can't believe you can't smell it.

33:29.633 --> 33:30.748
RORY: Hey!

33:32.094 --> 33:34.085
Over here! Help!

33:47.318 --> 33:48.478
Sophie.

33:48.611 --> 33:49.942
Sophie, come here.

33:52.489 --> 33:54.070
I can't get this off my leg.

33:54.909 --> 33:56.399
I can't get you out of here.

33:56.827 --> 33:57.942
Yes, you can.

33:58.287 --> 33:59.743
It's a bear trap.

34:05.586 --> 34:06.746
(GRUNTING)

34:10.799 --> 34:11.959
I can't get out of it.

34:12.968 --> 34:15.505
There's only one way you're gonna get better.

34:22.144 --> 34:23.179
No.

34:25.481 --> 34:28.268
Sophie, you're not gonna die out here.

34:29.818 --> 34:31.319
You have to do this.

34:32.488 --> 34:35.150
I can't eat you. You're gonna save me.

34:45.501 --> 34:46.866
(GRUNTING)

34:57.972 --> 34:59.303
(PANTING)

35:25.708 --> 35:27.039
(GROWLING)

35:35.843 --> 35:36.923
Run.

35:37.886 --> 35:39.422
I'm not gonna be able
to hold out much longer.

35:50.107 --> 35:51.563
You did the right thing.

35:54.737 --> 35:57.228
Please, don't. I'm sorry for everything.

35:57.614 --> 35:59.195
This isn't about vengeance.

36:00.034 --> 36:01.240
My life doesn't matter.

36:02.077 --> 36:04.568
This is about the lives you'd take
if I let you go.

36:04.747 --> 36:06.362
I can control it, I promise.

36:06.457 --> 36:07.742
No, you can't.

36:08.917 --> 36:11.124
Evil always rises to the surface.

36:11.879 --> 36:15.588
That's why you gotta cut it off where it lives.

36:16.091 --> 36:17.251
FRANKIE: Amelia!

36:17.509 --> 36:18.669
Don't touch her!

36:18.761 --> 36:20.626
NATHAN: Rev, stop, don't do it.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.090
(GUN FIRES)

36:24.767 --> 36:25.927
AMELIA: Frankie!

37:16.485 --> 37:18.316
You were aiming for his shoulder, right?

37:23.033 --> 37:24.193
Amelia.

37:24.326 --> 37:26.533
No, no. Stay right where you are, Son.
Don't move.

37:31.041 --> 37:32.201
Who did this?

37:32.584 --> 37:33.664
Idid.

37:33.877 --> 37:34.957
He was gonna kill her.

37:35.045 --> 37:36.125
So what?

37:36.213 --> 37:38.169
She's a monster. He's a man of God.

37:38.424 --> 37:41.507
Officer Parker followed procedure
and prevented a murder.

37:42.511 --> 37:44.172
It was a proper kill, end of story.

37:58.026 --> 38:00.233
I gave her a couple of drops of morphine
to stabilize her.

38:00.404 --> 38:01.564
It's only temporary.

38:01.864 --> 38:02.944
What about you?

38:03.198 --> 38:04.449
You should get that leg looked at.

38:05.117 --> 38:06.527
I'll drop them off first.

38:17.296 --> 38:19.708
I didn't think I was strong enough
to make it through this.

38:20.424 --> 38:21.709
Now I know that I am.

38:23.469 --> 38:25.209
I'll be here when you come back, Amelia.

38:25.721 --> 38:26.756
I promise.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.255
-Let's go.
-I love you.

39:16.563 --> 39:17.723
Where is he taking them?

39:18.273 --> 39:19.649
You probably don't wanna know.

39:20.776 --> 39:21.856
Yeah, I do.

39:22.819 --> 39:25.481
Slaughter house. Out by Route 14.

39:25.822 --> 39:26.982
Livestock.

39:27.908 --> 39:32.572
Kind of a live-work setup,
till The Troubles are over.

39:44.132 --> 39:45.918
What the hell happened out there?

39:57.479 --> 40:00.437
There's going to be an inquiry
into the shooting.

40:01.525 --> 40:04.517
I'm going to have to explain
why I didn't aim for his leg.

40:06.280 --> 40:07.565
That's a good question.

40:08.949 --> 40:10.064
Why didn't you?

40:10.742 --> 40:11.822
Are you serious?

40:12.286 --> 40:16.245
Look, you're not gonna see me crying
at the Rev's funeral,

40:17.124 --> 40:18.534
but your timing, Audrey...

40:18.792 --> 40:20.657
An hour before you killed him,

40:21.253 --> 40:23.710
he was dangling the keys to Haven
in front of my nose

40:23.797 --> 40:25.253
and I was this close.

40:27.426 --> 40:28.541
Because of you,

40:31.221 --> 40:32.506
I got nothing.

40:33.807 --> 40:34.922
Oh, I'm sorry.

40:35.434 --> 40:37.550
I'm sorry that I screwed up your plans.

40:40.981 --> 40:42.061
No.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.518
If you were with the Rev,

40:44.860 --> 40:47.021
and he was about to kill that little girl,

40:49.114 --> 40:50.615
would you have stopped him?

40:51.533 --> 40:52.648
Honestly,

40:54.494 --> 40:55.620
I don't know.

40:58.665 --> 41:00.530
Well, you need to figure that out, Duke.

41:01.460 --> 41:05.749
Because while you're looking for answers,
the rest of us, we're fighting a war.

41:08.925 --> 41:10.711
I did what I had to do.
