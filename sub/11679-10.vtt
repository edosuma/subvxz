00:05.605 --> 00:08.096
- [ Man ] We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.
- [ Whistles ]

00:08.173 --> 00:10.574

Whenyou're burned,you've got nothing--

00:10.643 --> 00:13.203
no cash, no credit, nojob history..

00:13.279 --> 00:16.407
- You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?

Miam i.

00:18.184 --> 00:20.812
You do whatever work comes your way.

00:20.887 --> 00:23.549
- You rely on anyone who's still talking to you--
- [ Laughs ]

00:23.623 --> 00:26.490
- a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend--
- Should we shoot them?

00:26.559 --> 00:29.392
an old friend who used to inform on you
to the F.B.I.--

00:29.462 --> 00:31.760
You know spies.
Bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:31.831 --> 00:34.163
- Family too--
- Hey, is that your mom again?

00:34.234 --> 00:36.395
- ifyou're desperate.
- Someone needs your help, Michael.

00:36.469 --> 00:38.937
Bottom line:
Untilyou figure out who burnedyou...

00:40.974 --> 00:43.772
you're not going anywhere.

00:43.843 --> 00:46.607
- Previously on Burn Notice.
- The people who burned me...

00:46.679 --> 00:50.615
got a specialized rifle for a sniper,
got him an access card for this building...

00:50.683 --> 00:53.277
and sent him to the conference room
on the fourth floor.

00:53.353 --> 00:55.378
[ Sam ] But we don't know
what he was doing in there.

00:55.455 --> 00:58.652
[ Michael] He 's scouting a perch, Sam.
I think I found his target.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.920
Ifyou wanna get in her room,
now would be the time.

I think we're getting close, Mikey.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.661

or there will be consequences.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.171
There are cops here,
and they're arresting your brother.

01:13.239 --> 01:16.174
It's a setup. She's gonna have her sniper
take his target out now.

01:16.242 --> 01:19.769
I can get home, get that access card,
I can get to the sniperbefore he takes a shot.

01:19.846 --> 01:24.112
I got some news. Sniper's dead.
Someone booby-trapped his front door, Mikey.

01:32.392 --> 01:35.225
[ Michael Narrating] When you're a spy,
you learn to live with the idea...

01:35.295 --> 01:37.456
ofpeople wantingyou dead--

01:37.530 --> 01:41.227
an old enemy, a dissatisfied employer,
a disgruntled asset.

Work long enough,

- We gotta keep moving.

04:05.411 --> 04:08.608
[Michael Narrating] Whenyou're
being hunted, paranoia is inevitable.

04:08.681 --> 04:13.618
Ifyou don't know what to do with it,
it turns into cold, directionless fear.

04:13.686 --> 04:17.884

into hyperawareness ofyour surroundings.

There's a treatment center

- A scam?

06:24.984 --> 06:26.918

I seeyou bought a new door.
Any progress finding our bomber?

40:53.076 --> 40:57.638
Nope. Checked the blast.
Crude I.E.D. Amateur hour.

40:58.782 --> 41:00.249
[ Chuckles ]

41:00.317 --> 41:02.751
We recruited you
becauseyou're a good liar.

41:02.819 --> 41:06.915
Guess we can't complain too much
when you lie to us. Hmm?

41:09.059 --> 41:11.584
But know this.

41:11.662 --> 41:14.130
One way or another...

41:14.197 --> 41:16.188
I expect results.

41:16.266 --> 41:18.257
Understand?

41:19.336 --> 41:22.328
- Loud and clear.
- Good.

41:25.509 --> 41:28.239
Doing your own errands?
It's not likeyou.

41:29.613 --> 41:32.946
Exceptional times
call for exceptional measures.

41:36.053 --> 41:38.817
[Michael Narrating] Whenyou've spent
enough time as an operative...

41:38.889 --> 41:40.880
recovering from a brush with death...

41:40.957 --> 41:44.017
isn't about an appointment
with the psychiatrist or a week in Hawaii.

41:44.094 --> 41:46.085
It's about having a purpose...

41:46.163 --> 41:50.600
whether it's something to fight
or someone to hunt.
