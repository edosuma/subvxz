00:04.171 --> 00:06.271
You guys clearly
love each other,

00:06.340 --> 00:07.973
and you actually both
want the same thing.

00:08.042 --> 00:10.743
Very much so.

00:10.811 --> 00:12.945
I think y'all
need to get married.

00:13.014 --> 00:15.681
Once y'all get married,
everything will be
more smooth for y'all.

00:15.750 --> 00:17.416
Check!

00:17.485 --> 00:19.318
You do what you doing
and I do what I'm doing.

00:19.387 --> 00:22.087
I just want you to
acknowledge Alaiya.

00:22.156 --> 00:23.856
This little girl
needs to know her father,

what it is.

We all know Yandy

00:30.765 --> 00:32.631
Mmm! Ugh!

00:32.700 --> 00:34.800
It looks good for her
on social media.

00:34.869 --> 00:38.103
Kim felt comfortable enough
to sit there and talk about

00:38.172 --> 00:41.640
Yandy adopting Infinity
for clout or something.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.175
That's gonna
strike up something.

00:43.244 --> 00:45.511
You know, she don't
play about her kids.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.212

I love you, baby,

been through with Juelz

I'm so touched that Kimbella
asked me to be a bridesmaid.

02:38.025 --> 02:40.025
You know, I've been hearing
a lot of people

02:40.094 --> 02:43.395
talking about how Juelz
only got engaged because
he's going to jail,

02:43.464 --> 02:46.131
and that is so far
from the truth.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.900
He loves his woman
and it's time.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.568
We'll be like, Joe.
Hi, Joe.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.370
Be like, hey, Joe,
how you doing?
How you doing?

02:51.438 --> 02:55.040
Don't put too much
pressure, guys. One thing
at a time with Joe.
What's going on?

02:55.109 --> 02:57.576
We actually sat down
with somebody, right?
Uh-huh.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.578
I really wouldn't call it
like a therapy session,

02:59.647 --> 03:03.615
but there was just,
like, so many, like,
underlying issues

03:03.684 --> 03:06.418
that we didn't even
really realize.

03:06.487 --> 03:08.787
The conversation
helped so much.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.889
Like, it's so light
in the house now.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.858
We're having sex again,
but it's also, like,

03:12.927 --> 03:16.628
baby, like, you know,
like, he's different now.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.164
His responses are different.
He's more affectionate.

03:19.233 --> 03:20.966
A different type
of intimacy.

03:21.035 --> 03:24.636
Dr. Jenn gave us some
really, really, really,
really good tips.

03:24.705 --> 03:29.541
Every night, once the baby
asleep, we take 20 minutes
of our time,

connecting, looking at each
other in the eye.

I'm not ready for the nanny.

We can come with you?
Of course.

is no exception.

we're all under strict orders
to dress for the occasion.

outfit, it's really nice

We've made a commitment
to carving out some quality
minutes for the relationship,

05:10.811 --> 05:12.778
and it's paying
huge dividends.

05:12.846 --> 05:15.480
So, when are you gonna
have some free time?

05:15.549 --> 05:21.153

to invite Joe
on the girls' trip.
(laughs)

05:55.723 --> 05:57.255

the girls during the day,

05:57.324 --> 05:59.057
do some girl stuff,

Crashing Cyn's girl trip
is not exactly my idea
of a dream vacation,

06:25.319 --> 06:30.255

it's a girls' trip, Cyn.
Why are you inviting Joe?

about it and I was

He's in a very weird place
where he's just trying to
figure things out,

08:31.078 --> 08:33.578
and this, I mean, you
just said Joe's coming.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.213
Instead of Joe hanging
around us all day,

08:35.282 --> 08:38.450
so we can get some
girl time, maybe Joe can

08:38.519 --> 08:40.552
hang out with Safaree.
Come on, now.

08:40.621 --> 08:45.624
Safaree and I used to be
friends, but lately I feel like
the friendship is one-sided.

08:45.692 --> 08:49.561
Safaree doesn't check
on me. He's not really a good
friend to me, but if Safaree

08:49.630 --> 08:53.532

can still have some girl time.

called me up and invited me
out for a drink.

I wanted to kind of
reconnect 'cause that

little studio session
was a little bit awkward.

wanted to strangle him

But I didn't know that.
You didn't know,
but he knew.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.893
So, what did he say
about it? Like...
He just kept saying

09:54.962 --> 09:58.363
I'm not a rapper, but
it all boils down to he
doesn't want me to do music.

09:58.432 --> 10:00.231
Well, if you want to
do music, I think you
should do music.

10:00.300 --> 10:06.004
So, I did. Um, this boy
that I know from Brooklyn
named Hollywood Play,

10:06.073 --> 10:10.342
he hit me up maybe
a couple days later
and he sent me a song

10:10.410 --> 10:13.278
which was really,
really dope, and then
the very next day,

10:13.347 --> 10:17.115
I get the news that
the boy I just did
the song with died.

10:17.184 --> 10:21.820
He got shot
the very next day.
This shooting crap
is crazy.

10:21.888 --> 10:25.423
Like, I was in the
same type of situation,
like, with Tr3way,

10:25.492 --> 10:27.092
with the shooting
outside the restaurant.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.494
I'm stressed the (bleep)
out at this point.

10:29.563 --> 10:32.764
Like, everything has
just fell apart because
my team, Tr3way,

10:32.833 --> 10:37.469
that I was with,
everybody is in jail, so
I'm kind of by myself now.

10:37.537 --> 10:40.105
I heard about that
on the blogs.
Yeah.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.973
They had a big case
behind them

10:42.042 --> 10:44.309
and pretty much they
got indicted and...

10:44.378 --> 10:46.144
They have
racketeering charges?
Yeah.

10:46.213 --> 10:49.714
Girl.
And, um, at this point,
I don't think they're
even coming out.

10:49.783 --> 10:52.517
Everything that
I had planned is
basically going left.

10:52.586 --> 10:55.186
I moved up here,
I moved my life here,
my child here.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.689
There's just a lot
going on.

10:59.192 --> 11:00.725
Don't cry.
Give me a hug.

11:00.794 --> 11:04.429
(Alexis)
I moved to New York for one
reason and one reason only,

11:04.498 --> 11:06.998
to pursue my career and
to provide for my daughter.

11:07.067 --> 11:11.069
I have no choice at this
point to figure something out,
because I'm all Alaiya has.

11:11.138 --> 11:14.673
It's just super scary
right now 'cause I'm doing
everything by myself.

11:14.741 --> 11:17.275
It's like, if it's not
one thing, it's another.

11:17.344 --> 11:21.112
I wake up to me being
on the blogs with this
whole Solo Lucci thing.

11:21.181 --> 11:24.416
You know, me and him kind
of used to, like, date
when I was living in LA.

11:24.484 --> 11:27.118
Mm-hmm.
When I first announced
that I was even pregnant,

11:27.187 --> 11:29.688
he made a little joke,
like, "Oh, who knows
who the father is?"

11:29.756 --> 11:31.756
So people just
kept running with it
to the point

11:31.825 --> 11:33.558
where he started
believing, like,
"I'm her father,"

11:33.627 --> 11:36.327
but I'm like, "Dude,
I was never pregnant
when I was with you."

11:36.396 --> 11:39.130
Like, I got pregnant
after my birthday. Like,
do the (bleep) math.

11:39.199 --> 11:44.302
Solo mother(bleep) Lucci
knows damn well he is
not my child's father.

11:44.371 --> 11:47.405
I just feel like he's trying
to keep himself relevant
and because these rumors

11:47.474 --> 11:50.175
is going around about Lucci
being my daughter's father,

11:50.243 --> 11:52.744
it's causing problems
with her real father.

11:52.813 --> 11:56.047
What does Fetty say?
He never says,
"Oh, she's not mine."

11:56.116 --> 11:59.350
Fetty just tries to play this
game but he still doesn't
want to do the test.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.086
At this point, my last
option is to just

12:01.154 --> 12:03.922
handle it through
the courts and just
do it that way.

12:03.990 --> 12:08.159
I'm not gonna keep
playing the cat and
mouse game with him.
Right.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.895
The other girl, Alexis
Skyy, thought I was gonna
put her on the song.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.264
Oh, hell no.
The name of the song
is "My Bitch Badder."

12:13.333 --> 12:15.033
(laughs)
(bleep)!

12:15.102 --> 12:18.336
Every time you post
a picture of Alaiya, they
come at me 1,000 times.

12:18.405 --> 12:22.474
If that's my daughter,
bruh, I'm gonna be there
one million percent.

so I'm finishing up all my work

12:56.843 --> 12:58.810
I got a new sneaker line
coming out.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.179
I wanted to take
this Black Love thing

13:01.248 --> 13:03.214

family, we're showing
having a foundation,

13:43.356 --> 13:45.456
and we're saluting

(baby's heart beating)

13:45.525 --> 13:47.559
Cut.
All right, cool.

13:47.627 --> 13:50.295
All right?
Chill.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.530
So, we good?
Good, man, yeah.
How you feeling, man?

13:52.599 --> 13:55.033
I'm good, man. Just trying
to get this work done, man,

13:55.101 --> 13:57.502
before it's too late, man,
you know what I mean?
It's about Black Love.

13:57.571 --> 13:59.771
You know it,
you know it.
You promoting
Black Love so much

13:59.840 --> 14:02.607
that my guy just went
out here and proposed
to Kimbella onstage.

14:02.676 --> 14:05.677
Yo, man, congratulations
on that, man.
Well, it was long overdue.

14:05.745 --> 14:08.146
For real. Yo, but when
the wedding, though?
When the wedding?

14:08.215 --> 14:12.016
My thing is, it's not
no holdup for me. You know,
I want to marry her.

14:12.085 --> 14:17.188
So, if you willing to do it,
you know, now, before I
gotta do my situation

14:17.257 --> 14:21.226
and handle my situation
or if you want to wait,
you know, well,

14:21.294 --> 14:23.995
whatever you want to do.
Well, me and Remy
had the wedding planned

14:24.064 --> 14:27.065
back in...
before she went in.
Yeah.

14:27.133 --> 14:30.201
One day she went to court,
they just snatched her,

14:30.270 --> 14:33.137
so we did the wedding vows
over the phone, first.
Word?

14:33.206 --> 14:35.206
That's why when she came home,
we had to do the ceremony,
so what I'm saying to you is,

14:35.275 --> 14:38.509
I don't want you to wait
'til the last minute. You
should just get it locked in.

14:38.578 --> 14:41.412
A lot of people saying Juelz
only proposed to Kimbella

14:41.481 --> 14:44.449
because he's going away,
but I totally disagree.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.484
Me and my wife had
our own situation

14:46.553 --> 14:50.021
when she was going away
and, trust me, it's not easy.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.890
Juelz already did what
he got to do.
Yeah.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.791
I'm working on Budden
right now, working on him.

14:53.860 --> 14:56.828
It's your time now, bro.
I just want to make sure

14:56.897 --> 15:01.232
that she herself is not
rushing into something.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.268
Why you playing
with that, bro?
I'm not playing!

15:03.336 --> 15:06.771
You're never gonna know
her full potential until
you make her your wife.

15:06.840 --> 15:11.309
But you against doing it
if it's incorrect.
She already
gave you a child,

15:11.378 --> 15:13.111
so she already spoke
for her actions.

15:13.179 --> 15:15.546
(Joe)
Pap made a good point.
Cyn's already given me

15:15.615 --> 15:18.750
one of the greatest
joys of my life with
our son Lexington,

15:18.818 --> 15:22.954
but we were in a bad place
a few weeks ago and I don't
want to rush anything

15:23.023 --> 15:25.623
and have some of those same
problems continue to occur.

15:25.692 --> 15:28.760
He gonna catch the bouquet.
Hell, yeah, that
(bleep) gonna catch it.

15:28.828 --> 15:29.894
Ain't no playing.
He gonna be the
first one in line.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.562
I know he gonna catch it.
Man, stop it, man.

15:31.631 --> 15:32.797
(laughter)

15:32.866 --> 15:35.433
You gotta slow down, man.
I'm coming for you next.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.201
(bleep)!
(laughs)

15:37.270 --> 15:39.170
Uh-oh.
Listen, man, I'm
a recovering male thot.

15:39.239 --> 15:42.974
Word? I'm trying to get
myself to the right place.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.609
Man ain't playing
with us, (bleep).

15:44.678 --> 15:47.745
Speaking of all this,
how's she doing?
Not good right now.

15:47.814 --> 15:50.081
It's a rap song.
She sings.
Mm-hmm.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.483
This is rap. I'm like,
you don't rap, (bleep).

15:52.552 --> 15:55.687
So, the other girl, Alexis
Skyy, thought I was gonna
put her on the song.

15:55.755 --> 15:59.023
Oh, hell no.
The name of the song
is "My Bitch Badder."

15:59.092 --> 16:01.492
(laughs)
(bleep)!

16:01.561 --> 16:03.294
Cut!
Somebody get
this (bleep).

16:03.363 --> 16:08.800
Somebody get this guy,
man. I know you ain't
cosigning that, brother.

16:08.868 --> 16:11.502
I really didn't think
that Maggie would still
be mad about this record,

16:11.571 --> 16:14.973
but I get it.
It's a big deal for her.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.741
So, because of this...
Mm-hmm.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.176
We ain't really been
talking like that.

16:18.244 --> 16:21.245
She got you
on time-out, huh?
(laughs)

16:21.314 --> 16:23.748
Aww, (bleep).
So she going on a trip
or whatever,

16:23.817 --> 16:27.318
Costa Rica or some (bleep).
Cyn just invited me
to go to Costa Rica.

16:27.387 --> 16:30.288
You going?
Yeah, I'ma go. I don't
get much time to do
the vacation thing.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.690
That's dope. So, all
y'all are going, then?

16:32.759 --> 16:34.892
I ain't going.
You know, I can't go
due to my situation,

16:34.961 --> 16:36.627
but I definitely,
you know, I encouraged Kim.

16:36.696 --> 16:39.030
You know, she been
doing a lot.
Oh, she going too?

16:39.099 --> 16:40.898
Yeah, yeah,
I told her to go out
there and have fun.

16:40.967 --> 16:43.434
I'm gonna hold the house
down, hold the kids down,
you know what I'm saying?

16:43.503 --> 16:46.771
Ain't no guys going
to Costa Rica. You
might as well come.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.540
Maggie's going.
You know what that
plane ride gonna feel like

16:49.609 --> 16:51.309
with all that heat
coming between us?

16:51.378 --> 16:52.710
There's gonna be
a lot of turbulence.

16:52.779 --> 16:55.013
(laughter)

16:56.983 --> 17:00.318
♪♪

17:03.723 --> 17:06.124
(Alexis)
Every day I wake up,
there's a new (bleep) blog,

17:06.192 --> 17:10.161
talking about Alexis Skyy
and Lucci being my baby's
(bleep) father,

17:10.230 --> 17:12.330
and he's (bleep) not.

17:12.399 --> 17:16.167
It's time to put an end to
these rumors once and for all,
but I couldn't face this

17:16.236 --> 17:19.837
on my own, so I had to bring
my best friend Ikey for support.

17:19.906 --> 17:25.176
So you know I invited Solo
to come 'cause he does all
this (bleep) on social media

17:25.245 --> 17:27.678
so let's just talk
face to face at this point

17:27.747 --> 17:29.547
and get this (bleep) done
and over with.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.616
So he's coming if he
even caught his flight.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.084
It's definitely time for
y'all to address this,

17:33.153 --> 17:36.020
because I see how
it affects you.
I know.

17:36.089 --> 17:37.321
I'm just ready to put
this (bleep) to rest, like...

17:37.390 --> 17:40.191
What's up?

17:40.260 --> 17:43.327
What's up, man?
You decided to come
in person, right?

17:43.396 --> 17:47.165
Instead of being
behind the Internet.
I got to, man.
There's too much going on.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.200
Lex, we better than that.
We're better than that,

17:49.269 --> 17:54.372
but you the one that
feeds into this (bleep).
All I ever did
was defend myself!

17:54.441 --> 17:57.608
Every time you post
a picture of Alaiya, they
come at me 1,000 times.

17:57.677 --> 18:00.344
So, when all these
people badgering me
and attacking me, like,

18:00.413 --> 18:02.780
"You a deadbeat daddy.
You not there for your
daughter,

18:02.849 --> 18:05.817
"you this, you that,"
at the end of the day,
the best thing I could do

18:05.885 --> 18:12.457
for myself is just say,
"Hey, I don't know."
I conceived July...
the end of July,

18:12.525 --> 18:16.461
beginning of August,
so when... We were
not messing around.

18:16.529 --> 18:19.230
Listen, you can say
1,000 times you know,
but this (bleep) like,

18:19.299 --> 18:21.632
somebody could tell you
1,000 times they didn't
steal from a store,

18:21.701 --> 18:24.535
but if you know they
a thief, you can't take
they word for that (bleep).

18:24.604 --> 18:28.973
So you mean to tell me
that you put your (bleep)
in me in July?

18:29.042 --> 18:30.808
I don't know when I put
my (bleep) in y'all.

18:30.877 --> 18:33.711
I did it 1,000 (bleep)
times. Look, this is
what I'm saying.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.481
I don't know how many
months you was pregnant
when you had the baby.

18:36.549 --> 18:40.184
I don't think nobody know.
Nobody know or we wouldn't
be sitting right here.

18:40.253 --> 18:43.788
Don't nobody know? (bleep)!
You the only one that (bleep)
is saying Alaiya's yours!

18:43.857 --> 18:46.557
You-- That's how you feel!
I'm the only one
that say that?

18:50.897 --> 18:53.931
All I want to do at
the end of the day is
figure this (bleep) out

18:54.000 --> 18:58.169
because if that's my
daughter, bruh, I'm gonna
be there one million percent.

18:58.238 --> 19:02.206
You might know 100% in
your head, but in my head,
I'm really 50:50, honestly.

19:02.275 --> 19:05.109
We just gotta
find out the right way.
Let's go take a test.

19:05.178 --> 19:09.680
Meet me at the DNA place.
I mean, I'm gonna do the test
and just get it over with.

19:09.749 --> 19:14.185
I'm so sick of waking up
every day on social media,
seeing these nasty comments,

19:14.254 --> 19:17.622
so if I have to prove
myself right to the world,
that's what I'ma do,

19:17.690 --> 19:21.058
but in return, I need
something from Lucci.

19:21.127 --> 19:26.164
When the results come
back, I want a request

19:26.232 --> 19:29.700
of a public apology.
Oh, you can give up
on that (bleep).

19:29.769 --> 19:31.369
You don't think
you should give her
a public apology?

19:31.437 --> 19:33.971
I would never
(bleep) apologize.
I will apologize...

19:34.040 --> 19:36.474
I'm not apologizing
for how I feel.
So if I apologize to you...

19:36.543 --> 19:38.676
We can take the test.
(bleep) you, then!

19:38.745 --> 19:40.244
Man, I'm out, man.

19:40.313 --> 19:42.647
Yo, bro, you gotta
apol... How you not
gonna apologize to her?

19:42.715 --> 19:45.850
Bro, for saying what?
I'm saying...

19:45.919 --> 19:47.852
For publicly being a (bleep)
and being ignorant.

19:47.921 --> 19:52.356
You... (bleep)!
Oh, well, (bleep) you, then.
You know what? (bleep) you.

19:52.425 --> 19:55.393
Okay?
We take the DNA test
and we'll figure it out.

19:55.461 --> 19:57.261
Meet me at the DNA place.

19:57.330 --> 20:01.165
I pray that things,
you know, work theyself out.

20:01.234 --> 20:03.935
Now, so much time has passed
that I'm to the point

20:04.003 --> 20:06.604
where I don't even know
what the (bleep) is going on.

20:08.575 --> 20:12.243

20:20.353 --> 20:23.020
You better enjoy this break
'cause when we come back,
ain't gonna be no break.

20:23.089 --> 20:24.622
Oh, please.
Yeah.

20:24.691 --> 20:27.325
So I can already see
where this is going.
Let me get a seat.
Yeah.

20:27.393 --> 20:32.530
We just finished shooting our
last episode for this season
of "State of the Culture,"

20:32.599 --> 20:36.567
and I'll be honest, I'm
looking forward to getting
a little bit of down time.

20:36.636 --> 20:40.371
Things have been a lot
lighter in house and much
better between Cyn and I.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.808
I'm not naive enough to
think that our problems
are completely over,

20:43.876 --> 20:47.278
but I must say, our future's
looking brighter than ever.

20:47.347 --> 20:51.182
So, listen, I enjoyed that
video shoot the other day.

20:51.251 --> 20:54.452
(laughs)
Pap. That was like
a therapy session for me.

20:54.520 --> 20:57.888
He said a lot that I think
I needed to hear.

20:57.957 --> 21:02.893
Pap was saying, "You should
propose no matter what."
(laughs)

21:02.962 --> 21:04.829
He was saying, "Don't
matter what's going on,

21:04.897 --> 21:07.164
because there's always
gonna be stuff going on."

21:07.233 --> 21:08.733
There's always gonna be
stuff going on.

21:08.801 --> 21:11.068
What if you propose...
And...

21:11.137 --> 21:15.273
...and then, like,
extra (bleep) comes,
and then you like, eh!

21:15.341 --> 21:20.911
It's really nothing
to be scared of.
It's actually a relief.

21:20.980 --> 21:24.515
Like, you not
trying to do no
extra impressive...

21:24.584 --> 21:25.850
Like, you know what it's
like. This is what it is.

21:25.918 --> 21:28.986
Oh, I better stop that.
You got me.
That's it.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.788
Oh, I'm excited.
We can figure it out.

21:30.857 --> 21:32.290
Hello.
Hello.
Hey, kiddo.

21:32.358 --> 21:34.025
How are you?
I'm doing well.
How about you?

21:34.093 --> 21:35.993
How are you doing?
I'm doing well.

21:36.062 --> 21:38.396
Remy, this is my oldest.
I know, I know.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.197
Tre, Remy, Remy, Tre.
How you doing?

21:40.266 --> 21:41.832
I'm doing well.
How about you?

21:41.901 --> 21:44.201
I'm good, good. Just
sitting here, chatting
it up with your dad.

21:44.270 --> 21:46.837
Yeah, we was having...
having a good grown folk talk.

21:46.906 --> 21:49.540
(laughs)
Oh, yeah,
that's my father, yeah.

21:49.609 --> 21:50.741
That's how I feel.
You know what?

21:50.810 --> 21:53.177
I mean, he's like,
"Yeah, that's my father."

21:53.246 --> 21:56.480
Not being involved in
my older son Tre's life
when he was coming up

21:56.549 --> 21:58.783
is one of my biggest
regrets in life.

21:58.851 --> 22:02.453
It meant a lot for me
to include Tre in Pap's
"Golden Child" video,

22:02.522 --> 22:07.925
and I really enjoy the fact
that we get to spend time
together while I'm working.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.361
Now, sit, sit, sit,
sit, sit, sit.

22:10.430 --> 22:13.597
So there's something
I want to run by you
without Cyn being around.

22:13.666 --> 22:16.100
You know, there's
baby steps to (bleep).

22:16.169 --> 22:20.938
Me and you had to get right.
Me and Cyn had to get right.

22:21.007 --> 22:26.010
You know, Lex is here,
so I'm not planning
this immediately,

22:26.079 --> 22:29.180
but if I were thinking
about getting married,

22:29.248 --> 22:33.684
you would need time
to get used to that.
I don't think so.

22:33.753 --> 22:35.319
Why?
You've been
leading up to it,

22:35.388 --> 22:38.155
so I can tell.
You can tell what?

22:38.224 --> 22:40.825
I could tell that you
and Cyn were getting
married eventually.

22:40.893 --> 22:44.028
How could you tell that?
You didn't-- Cyn didn't
just pop in the house.

22:44.097 --> 22:48.165
It's been a couple years,
so I'd rather you with
Cyn than anyone else.

22:48.234 --> 22:52.236
Yo, who is paying you
to say that? What
the (bleep)? Cyn?

22:52.305 --> 22:57.475
I'm kind of surprised
that Tre is so enthusiastic
about me marrying Cyn.

22:57.543 --> 23:01.278
He's only 17, but I guess
I shouldn't be too surprised,

23:01.347 --> 23:04.115
because Tre and Cyn have
a great relationship.

23:04.183 --> 23:07.651
Tre's approval means the world
to me, and so does the fact

23:07.720 --> 23:11.355
that so many of my peers seem
to be cosigning my proposal.

23:11.424 --> 23:16.427
Just give me a hug.

and I've also been collecting
these character letters

23:38.084 --> 23:41.585
to hand in to the judge for,
you know, my sentencing,

23:41.654 --> 23:45.956
and there's one particular one
I'm gonna get today.

23:46.025 --> 23:50.327
To be honest with you,
Juelz will text me randomly,

23:50.396 --> 23:53.731
ask about Mendeecees,
ask about the kids,

23:53.800 --> 23:58.769
but as far as us
and our relationship,
it's really thrown off,

23:58.838 --> 24:01.605
and I really don't
feel good about it.

24:01.674 --> 24:04.074
So, what's up?
What's up?

24:04.143 --> 24:06.110
I texted you
the other day.

24:06.179 --> 24:08.212
Yeah, I know.

24:08.281 --> 24:10.314
About the letter.
I said I got you.

24:10.383 --> 24:13.384
That's the only time...
What?

24:13.453 --> 24:15.219
...I get to talk to you
is when I text you.

24:15.288 --> 24:18.355
No. When you need
something is the only time

24:18.424 --> 24:20.825
you get to talk to me.
No, no, no, no.

24:20.893 --> 24:23.727
You want to know
really why I text you?
Yeah, tell me.

24:23.796 --> 24:27.131
I text you because
I honestly felt
some type of way

24:27.200 --> 24:33.170
that it was three days
after my proposal
and you didn't hit me.

24:33.239 --> 24:38.175
Okay, well, face to face,
congratulations.

24:38.244 --> 24:41.378
I am happy for you.
I think it's an amazing thing.

24:41.447 --> 24:45.115
Well, I appreciate it,
but I feel like you
allowing

24:45.184 --> 24:48.352
you and Kim's situation
to affect me and you.

24:48.421 --> 24:52.356
The only reason why I stepped
away is because I don't like
coming in between you two.

24:52.425 --> 24:54.725
I didn't like that feeling
of being in the middle,

24:54.794 --> 24:56.827
so I stopped picking up
my phone for you, I stopped
picking up my phone for her,

24:56.896 --> 24:58.963
and I was just like,
I just need a break.

24:59.031 --> 25:02.132
Every single person
I meet with, every
conversation I have is,

25:02.201 --> 25:05.236
she hates your guts,
she says you're fake,
you're phony.

25:05.304 --> 25:07.571
You've been doing
these horrible things
to her for years.

25:07.640 --> 25:11.008
She done brought up so
many things, and I'm like,
what is the problem?

25:11.077 --> 25:13.511
I don't know. I just be
trying to stay out of it,
like I said.

25:13.579 --> 25:16.146
Juelz, I feel like you
should have stopped this.
But I can't.

25:16.215 --> 25:18.449
I can't.
How? How?
How can't you be like...?

25:18.518 --> 25:22.253
Because that's my woman
and you supposed to
be my sister,

25:22.321 --> 25:24.788
so I stepped back and I...
and I... and I... and I pray

25:24.857 --> 25:29.026
that... that... that...
that things, you know,
work theyself out.

25:29.095 --> 25:32.296

know what the (bleep)
is going on.

25:34.734 --> 25:38.469
Nor do I. I feel like
this whole situation
is nonsense.

25:38.538 --> 25:42.806
I can't... No one can
seem to explain to me
what I did to this girl.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.642
I can't sit here
and talk for her.

25:44.710 --> 25:47.111
This is a conversation
that y'all have to have.

25:47.179 --> 25:51.482
It's baffling to me that they
can't just sit down like women,

25:51.551 --> 25:55.352
sisters, and fix this and,
you know, keep it pushing.

25:55.421 --> 25:58.422
Moving forward,
I wish y'all would
get it together.

25:58.491 --> 26:00.925
That's just the truth.
Like, if I am supposed
to be your brother,

26:00.993 --> 26:04.328
you supposed to be
my sister, like, how
do we move forward

26:04.397 --> 26:06.497
without the situation
with you and Kim,

26:06.566 --> 26:10.501
you know, being,
like, an issue?

26:15.441 --> 26:20.244

my baby are here to have
a romantic getaway.
Yay!

This conversation
with Juelz got me so sad,
but you know what?

27:29.548 --> 27:34.018
Thanks to Juju, I got
a trip to Costa Rica to take
my mind off of all of that.

27:34.086 --> 27:38.422
I brought two suitcases.
What the...?

27:38.491 --> 27:40.891

stand there and watch me.

27:40.960 --> 27:44.361
Wow. What
a strong guy you are.

27:44.430 --> 27:48.732
I know Juju isn't super
thrilled about me telling
Safaree about the trip,

27:48.801 --> 27:53.837

theirselves in, so come on,

of whether I should go
through with this whole
sex toy deal or not,

I don't feel like it's me.
