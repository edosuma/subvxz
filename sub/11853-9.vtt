10:44.710 --> 10:47.179
What are you playing, Nonny?

10:47.246 --> 10:48.714
Parking lot,

10:48.781 --> 10:51.684
that's a place where
you can park a lot of cars.

10:51.751 --> 10:54.020
(Making engine noises)

10:54.086 --> 10:56.722
How come you have your
space helmet on, Goby?

10:56.789 --> 11:00.159
I'm driving my moon car...
on the moon.

11:34.293 --> 11:37.096
On the moon.
(Chuckling)

11:37.163 --> 11:39.265
Once upon a time...

11:39.331 --> 11:43.102
there were two astronauts who
went to the moon to see a movie.

11:54.146 --> 11:55.681
Here we are on the moon.

11:55.748 --> 11:59.185
Now, which way
to the movie theatre?

11:59.251 --> 12:01.287
According to
my calculations,

12:01.353 --> 12:03.489
the movie theatre
is all the way over

12:03.556 --> 12:05.758
on the dark side
of the moon.

12:05.825 --> 12:07.760
We'll have
to drive there.

12:07.827 --> 12:10.396
{\an5}Let's take the moon car.

12:07.827 --> 12:10.396
(Beeping)

12:15.401 --> 12:18.537
Let's go!

12:18.604 --> 12:21.040
(Engine starting)

12:21.107 --> 12:24.143
{\an5}GIL:
And so, the astronauts
drove their moon car

12:24.210 --> 12:26.245
to the movie theatre.

12:26.312 --> 12:29.949
We should reach the dark side
of the moon any second now.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.587
GOBY:
Uh-oh, it's too dark.

12:34.653 --> 12:37.289
I can't see where I'm going.

12:37.356 --> 12:39.658
Let's turn on the headlights.

12:39.725 --> 12:43.095
The button is right
here on the dashboard.

12:43.162 --> 12:44.830
Every car has a dashboard.

12:44.897 --> 12:47.867
It's where you turn on and
off all the stuff in the car.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.835
Headlights on.

12:49.902 --> 12:52.071
{\an5}GOBY:
That's better.
Now we can see the road.

13:13.425 --> 13:15.561
I think we lost them.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.963
We'd better get
to the movie theatre.

13:18.030 --> 13:19.732
(Engine starting)

13:19.798 --> 13:23.235
{\an5}GIL:
So, the astronauts went
to look for the movie theatre,

13:23.302 --> 13:26.172
when suddenly...

13:26.238 --> 13:28.240
Uh-oh,

13:28.307 --> 13:31.677
I can hardly see anything.

13:31.744 --> 13:34.413

14:17.423 --> 14:18.991
Uh-oh,

14:19.058 --> 14:21.393
it looks like
we're out of gas.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.329
Out of gas?

Thank you, moon monkeys.

14:56.629 --> 15:01.233
{\an5}GIL:
And so, the moon monkeys gave
the astronauts enough moon gas

15:01.300 --> 15:03.669
to drive to the movie theatre.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.738
The movie's starting.

15:05.804 --> 15:08.207
Would anyone
like some popcorn?

Don't worry, everyone.
We just ran out of gas.

Oh, boy, if we don't
get out of the way,

19:28.534 --> 19:31.637

19:31.703 --> 19:33.171
Don't worry,

Let's help Mr. Grouper
find the place

19:40.045 --> 19:42.581

19:43.982 --> 19:47.319
Is it the supermarket,

19:52.391 --> 19:54.660

Right, you can fill your car
