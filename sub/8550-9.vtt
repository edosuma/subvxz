TO TELL ME

13:53.166 --> 13:55.068
WHY I SHOULDN'T
STUFF YOU
IN A DUMPSTER.

13:55.135 --> 13:59.839
GENTLEMEN, REJOICE.
I'M HERE TO JOIN.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.244
WAIT A MINUTE.
I KNOW YOU.

14:04.311 --> 14:07.514
YOU'RE THAT NERD
FROM THE BURGER JOINT.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.649
THAT'S MY DAY JOB.

14:09.716 --> 14:12.285
BY NIGHT, I'M URK MAN...

14:13.954 --> 14:17.757
A DERANGED, ANTISOCIAL,
BLOODTHIRSTY PSYCHO!

14:17.824 --> 14:19.960
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

14:22.329 --> 14:24.597
TAKE A PICTURE.
IT'LL LAST LONGER.

14:24.664 --> 14:25.933
YEAH.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.535
YOU'RE PRETTY
TOUGH, HUH?

14:28.601 --> 14:29.602
YEAH, I'M TOUGH.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.609
WELL, HOW TOUGH?

14:36.676 --> 14:39.112
WELL, WHEN I WAS BORN...

14:39.179 --> 14:40.880
YEAH.
AND THE DOCTOR
SLAPPED ME,

14:40.948 --> 14:42.549
YEAH.
I SHOT HIM!

14:44.684 --> 14:46.453
THAT'S TOUGH,
MAN.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.155
AAH!

15:03.670 --> 15:07.440
SORRY, IT'S JUST SOMETHING
ABOUT THOSE CHEESE PUFFS.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.180
NOW WHERE WAS I?

15:13.246 --> 15:14.414
OH, YEAH.
HOW TOUGH AM I?

15:15.949 --> 15:18.485
YEAH, WELL,
I ALSO DO
MY OWN DENTAL WORK.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.087
OH.

15:22.489 --> 15:26.459
AND I'VE BEEN KNOWN
TO RETURN VIDEOTAPES

15:26.526 --> 15:27.694
WITHOUT REWINDING.

15:31.064 --> 15:33.866
HEY, CHAIN, YOU WANT ME
TO HIT THIS PUNK?

15:33.933 --> 15:35.535
TRY ME, CHUNKY TRUNKS.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.243
BUT IT'S ONLY FAIR
TO WARN YOU

15:43.310 --> 15:45.445
THAT I'M A BLACK BELT
IN KARATE.

15:45.512 --> 15:48.448
I USED TO PRACTICE
IN THE SAHARA FOREST.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.752
THE SAHARA
IS A DESERT.

15:52.819 --> 15:55.122
OH, SURE...
AND NOW.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.325
HA!

16:05.465 --> 16:07.800
[STEVE] ALRIGHT.
LET'S TALK MEMBERSHIP.

16:07.867 --> 16:11.204
DO YOU NEED A LETTER
OF RECOMMENDATION
FROM MY PREVIOUS GANG?

16:11.271 --> 16:12.672
[CHAIN]
SIT DOWN!

16:12.739 --> 16:16.609
I GOT TO GIVE STEVE CREDIT.
THEY HAVEN'T KILLED HIM YET.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.311
YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.880
WINSLOW,
CHECK THESE OUT.

16:20.947 --> 16:22.649
WHAT?

16:22.715 --> 16:24.051
TRICK HANDCUFFS.

16:24.117 --> 16:27.587
THEY LOOK EXACTLY
LIKE REGULATION CUFFS.

16:27.654 --> 16:28.988
SIR...

16:29.056 --> 16:32.192
SHOULDN'T WE BE PAYING
MORE ATTENTION
TO STEVE'S TRANSMISSION?

16:32.259 --> 16:35.095
IF HE NEEDS US,
HE'LL SCREAM.

16:35.162 --> 16:37.097
YOU KNOW
WHAT'S BEAUTIFUL
ABOUT THESE GUYS?

16:37.164 --> 16:40.067
THEY'RE GREAT
ICE BREAKERS
AT SINGLES BARS.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.471
SIR, WE'RE ON DUTY.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.773
THIS IS NO TIME
FOR FOOLING AROUND.

16:46.839 --> 16:50.243
WELL, EXCUSE ME,
SERGEANT KILLJOY.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.011
WHERE'S THE KEY
FOR THESE?

16:52.079 --> 16:55.315
THERE ISN'T ONE.
YOU JUST TAP THEM
ON A CERTAIN SPOT.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.783
WATCH.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.818
OW!

16:58.885 --> 17:00.287
WRONG SPOT.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.322
OW!

17:02.389 --> 17:03.656
OW!

17:05.592 --> 17:07.927
I THINK THESE BABIES
ARE DEFECTIVE.

17:07.994 --> 17:09.796
GOOD THING
I KEPT THE RECEIPT.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.333
WOULD YOU
GET THESE OFF?

17:14.967 --> 17:18.538
I SEE SOMEONE'S MIGHTY GOOD
WITH A SPRAY CAN.

17:18.605 --> 17:19.739
YEAH.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.747
I'M AN ARTISTE.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.984
DID YOU DO
THAT GREAT DRAGON
AT RACHEL'S PLACE?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.320
YEAH. DID YOU SEE THAT?

17:33.386 --> 17:35.122
I WAS GONNA HAVE IT
IN THIS LAKE OF FIRE,

17:35.188 --> 17:38.291
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS
TOO DERIVATIVE AND TRITE.

17:40.127 --> 17:43.696
ABSOLUTELY. OH, AND
KUDOS TO YOU ON
THE GREAT JOB YOU DID

17:43.763 --> 17:45.232
ON SMASHING UP THE PLACE.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.734
WELL, THANK YOU.
I CAN'T TAKE
ALL THE CREDIT.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.370
THE GUYS HERE HELPED.
WE'RE LIKE A FAMILY.

17:50.437 --> 17:54.474
IT'S NICE THAT YOU
DO THINGS TOGETHER.

17:54.541 --> 17:55.842
YEAH. YEAH.

17:55.908 --> 17:59.212
WERE YOU TOGETHER WHEN YOU
BEAT UP THE WINSLOW KID?

17:59.279 --> 18:01.381
YEAH. IT WAS A TEAM EFFORT.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.883
YOU TALK TOO MUCH.
GET UP!

18:03.950 --> 18:05.518
WHY? I'M COMFY.

18:07.554 --> 18:10.590
I BEEN THINKING.
SOMETHING
DOESN'T ADD UP.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.125
WHAT MIGHT THAT BE?

18:12.192 --> 18:14.294
I'VE SEEN
TWO VERSIONS OF YOU--

18:14.361 --> 18:19.031
A WIMPY LITTLE NERD
AND THIS.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.900
SO, I ASK MYSELF,

18:20.967 --> 18:23.370
WHICH ONE IS
THE REAL ONE,

18:23.436 --> 18:25.505
AND I DON'T THINK
IT'S THIS.

18:26.173 --> 18:28.375
NICE EARRING.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.542
OW!

18:31.544 --> 18:34.581
LUCKY FOR YOU
THAT WAS A CLIP-ON.

18:36.683 --> 18:40.920
SO THEN I ASK MYSELF,
IF THIS IS JUST AN ACT,

18:40.987 --> 18:43.122
WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE?

18:44.457 --> 18:47.494
OH. COME UP
WITH AN ANSWER?

18:49.462 --> 18:52.265
IT OCCURS TO ME
THAT YOU
COULD BE WIRED.

18:54.534 --> 18:55.635
OH, NO!

18:55.702 --> 18:58.037
I MAY HAVE TAKEN
A SIP OF MOM'S COFFEE--

18:58.104 --> 19:00.507
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE OTHER KIND OF WIRE!

19:03.075 --> 19:04.744
ENOUGH!

19:07.380 --> 19:10.049
YOU'RE
ABSO-TOOTLE-LUTELY
RIGHT...

19:10.116 --> 19:12.252
CHAIN.

19:14.854 --> 19:18.325
I AM WIRED, AND I'VE
GOT THE BLITHERINGS

19:18.391 --> 19:21.328
OF THAT PICASSO PINHEAD
ON TAPE.

19:23.596 --> 19:26.165
SO COME ON AND GET THEM,
BIG GUY!

19:26.233 --> 19:28.801
IT'S TIME TO COLLECT
THE GARBAGE.

19:32.772 --> 19:35.174
WELL, COME ON, CARL.
DON'T DAWDLE!

19:36.576 --> 19:38.545
WE'VE GOT TO
GET THESE OFF NOW!

19:38.611 --> 19:41.848
CHAIN, I'M NOT
WEARING A WIRE.

19:41.914 --> 19:43.483
I WAS LYING.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.085
OH!

19:46.152 --> 19:48.521
HOW'D THAT GET THERE?

19:48.588 --> 19:50.723
FORGET IT, LIEUTENANT.
WE'RE GOING IN NOW!

19:50.790 --> 19:52.892
YEAH, BUT..

19:52.959 --> 19:55.228
[WHINING]

19:55.295 --> 19:56.763
CALM DOWN!

19:56.829 --> 19:58.030
[WHINING]

19:58.097 --> 19:59.766
I SAID CALM DOWN.

20:02.669 --> 20:04.604
FREEZE! POLICE!

20:13.680 --> 20:14.981
DROP THE KNIFE.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.284
I SAID
DROP THE KNIFE.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.453
AND HANDS OFF THE NERD.

20:23.456 --> 20:26.293
WHAT IN SAM HILL
TOOK YOU GUYS
SO LONG?

20:26.359 --> 20:29.028
WE HAD TO BE...
REALLY, REALLY SURE.

20:29.095 --> 20:30.563
REALLY SURE.

20:30.630 --> 20:34.434
10 MORE SECONDS
AND I WOULD'VE BEEN
A STEVE KEBAB.

20:34.501 --> 20:37.003
YOU DID REAL GOOD, STEVE.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.606
GEE, THANKS, BIG GUY.

20:39.672 --> 20:43.610
NOW LET'S CUFF THESE
BOHUNKS AND FEED THEM TO
THE PADDY WAGON.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.446
NO CUFFS. NO CUFFS.

20:46.513 --> 20:47.814
FELLAS, WE'RE GOING
OUTSIDE NOW.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.716
KEEP YOUR HANDS
WHERE I CAN SEE THEM.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.618
ALRIGHT.
ONE AT A TIME.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.620
SEE THE OFFICERS
OUTSIDE.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.087
LET'S GO.
KEEP IT MOVING.

20:55.154 --> 20:56.456
KEEP IT MOVING, COME ON.

20:56.523 --> 20:58.958
PICK UP THE PACE,
MR. BACKWARDS HAT.

21:00.126 --> 21:01.328
HEY...

21:01.394 --> 21:03.830
YOU GUYS ARE SO CASUAL
AND NONCHALANT.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.832
HEY, WE'RE PROFESSIONALS.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.044
A TOAST.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.412

21:19.479 --> 21:21.113

21:23.483 --> 21:25.418
THANK YOU.
I WANT TO TELL YOU
HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE

21:25.485 --> 21:28.154

OH, RACHEL,
WE'RE FAMILY,

21:31.023 --> 21:33.760
AND WE DON'T EXPECT
TO BE CHARGED FOR THIS FOOD.

21:35.495 --> 21:37.330
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.
ONE MORE TOAST.

21:37.397 --> 21:41.133
TO THE YOUNG MAN WHO HELPED
PUT THE DRAGONS AWAY
FOR A LONG TIME--

21:41.200 --> 21:43.235
STEVEN URKEL.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.971
YES!

21:45.037 --> 21:46.773
OH, THANKS, BIG GUY.

21:46.839 --> 21:49.409
MAY I DRAW YOUR ATTENTION
TO THE MENU

21:49.476 --> 21:52.144
AND THE NEW URKEL SANDWICH?

21:52.211 --> 21:55.615
YEAH, IT'S A HERO SANDWICH,
BUT IT'S MOSTLY BALONEY.
