00:51.389 --> 00:52.455
Yeah!

01:47.513 --> 01:49.512
Oh, son of a bitch.

01:56.121 --> 02:00.323
Whew.

02:00.358 --> 02:01.991
Oh.

02:02.027 --> 02:03.026
Huh?!

02:03.929 --> 02:06.563
What-what the hell do you want?

02:06.598 --> 02:09.532
No! No! Stop!

02:09.568 --> 02:11.234
Let go! Get out.

02:11.269 --> 02:12.902
Let go, let go!

02:14.806 --> 02:18.174
Stop! Let go, let go!

02:18.210 --> 02:20.577
Stop, stop!

03:13.515 --> 03:17.836
Arkie Seavers, age 20. Currently
a resident of the county jail.

03:18.796 --> 03:21.764
- What does the other guy look like?
- Funny you should ask.

03:21.799 --> 03:23.557
Arkie there wasn't in a fight.

03:23.592 --> 03:25.451
Car crash, head-on collision into a tree.

03:25.451 --> 03:27.717
- Drunk as a skunk.
- He's lucky to be alive.

03:27.718 --> 03:29.017
You have no idea.

03:29.052 --> 03:31.286
Not wearing a seat belt, I suspect.

03:31.321 --> 03:32.954
To hear Arkie tell it,
he didn't have time

03:32.990 --> 03:35.357
to fasten his seat belt,
'cause he was too busy beating

03:35.392 --> 03:37.859
a hasty retreat from the boy
he says caused the accident.

03:37.895 --> 03:39.959
- And who was that?
- You're looking at him.

03:41.198 --> 03:43.298
No, not me.

03:44.543 --> 03:45.910
What, he blames himself?

03:45.946 --> 03:47.312
In a manner of speaking.

03:47.776 --> 03:49.247
I don't get it, Mulder.

03:49.282 --> 03:52.650
Arkie, our hapless road warrior,

03:52.686 --> 03:55.653
is driving by his lonesome,
down the highway to hell,

03:55.689 --> 03:58.323
when he sees another Arkie,
across from him,

03:58.358 --> 04:00.974
who grabs the wheel
and crashes the vehicle.

04:02.362 --> 04:04.696
Well, you did say he was drunk.

04:04.731 --> 04:06.498
Yes, and I know what you're
gonna say about seeing double

04:06.533 --> 04:07.899
and all those hackneyed bromides

04:07.934 --> 04:09.534
about not giving the kids the car keys.

04:09.569 --> 04:11.503
20 is hardly a kid.

04:11.538 --> 04:13.571
But circumstances bear
a curious similarity

04:13.607 --> 04:15.340
to the stories told by other good folk

04:15.375 --> 04:17.075
who didn't share Arkie Seavers'
luck of the Irish,

04:17.110 --> 04:18.576
and who also reported

04:18.612 --> 04:20.178
seeing their doubles right before dying.

04:20.213 --> 04:21.880
And how did these people die?

04:21.915 --> 04:23.681
Each by their own hand.

04:23.717 --> 04:25.450
After seeing their doubles?

04:25.485 --> 04:28.420
According to all reports issuing
out of Henrico County, Virginia.

04:28.455 --> 04:30.223
Reports issued by whom?

04:30.258 --> 04:33.091
Friends, relatives. A doctor.

04:33.126 --> 04:35.293
And the medical diagnosis is...?

04:35.328 --> 04:37.562
- A rare form of schizophrenia.
- Right.

04:37.597 --> 04:39.364
So rare I've never heard of it.

04:39.399 --> 04:40.565
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, Scully,

04:40.600 --> 04:41.800
and I know that you will,

04:41.835 --> 04:43.134
but schizophrenics have been known

04:43.170 --> 04:45.937
to hear voices and have reported
hallucinations similar

04:45.972 --> 04:48.106
- to the ones Arkie reports.
- Hallucinations, yes,

04:48.141 --> 04:49.774
but not necessarily grabbing
the wheel of a car

04:49.810 --> 04:51.543
and ramming it into a tree.

04:51.578 --> 04:54.045
Well, they didn't all die
from car crashes into trees.

04:54.080 --> 04:56.314
Seven died from hanging,
four jumped off a tall bridge,

04:56.349 --> 04:59.050
- um, three...
- This is a mass phenomenon.

04:59.085 --> 05:01.653
Precisely my thinking, Scully,
which is why you and I

05:01.688 --> 05:03.922
are gonna jump on I-95 South this morning

05:03.957 --> 05:05.957
and get back to our bread and butter.

05:11.865 --> 05:13.765
These the FBI agents?

05:13.800 --> 05:15.099
Agents Scully and Mulder.

05:15.135 --> 05:16.468
- And you filled them in?
- Mm-hmm.

05:16.503 --> 05:18.136
We know the facts, Arkie.

05:18.171 --> 05:20.171
We'd like to hear the details.

05:20.637 --> 05:22.807
Okay, I-I looked over

05:23.265 --> 05:25.143
and he grabbed the wheel
and he floored the gas.

05:25.178 --> 05:27.912
- And by "he," you mean...?
- I mean,

05:28.353 --> 05:30.949
the dude looked just like me.

05:30.984 --> 05:32.350
And you'd seen him before.

05:32.385 --> 05:34.919
Yes. Like-like four times.

05:34.955 --> 05:36.321
He's been following me for, like, a week.

05:36.356 --> 05:38.089
Had he ever said anything?

05:38.124 --> 05:41.459
No, I-I-I'd see him in a crowd
or-or a window.

05:41.495 --> 05:43.761
You know, I thought I was
tripping or something.

05:43.797 --> 05:45.296
And do you take drugs, Arkie?

05:45.332 --> 05:46.580
No, I'm, uh...

05:47.372 --> 05:49.767
Yeah, maybe once or twice, I mean.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.303
And you're in jail because...?

05:52.339 --> 05:53.872
Arkie admittedly has a problem.

05:53.907 --> 05:56.140
A few previous DUI offenses.

05:56.756 --> 05:58.855
Exactly how many is a few?

05:58.891 --> 06:00.812
I don't know, like...

06:00.847 --> 06:02.514
...six?

06:03.096 --> 06:05.717
So, the judge is gonna
throw the book at you.

06:05.752 --> 06:07.852
But that's not what we're interested in.

06:08.602 --> 06:11.055
We want to know how you came
to be the lone survivor.

06:11.480 --> 06:12.891
Why I'm not dead

06:12.926 --> 06:14.826
like all the other people
they're talking about, right?

06:14.861 --> 06:16.373
What do you chalk that up to?

06:16.408 --> 06:18.730
I can tell you, and it's the same reason

06:18.765 --> 06:20.665
I can prove I'm not lying.

06:20.700 --> 06:22.100
You can prove it?

06:24.159 --> 06:25.303
You got to admit, Scully,

06:25.338 --> 06:27.872
the kid's story makes a lot of sense.

06:27.908 --> 06:30.041
Arkie's double takes control
of the wheel.

06:30.076 --> 06:32.544
Yeah, then Arkie pumps
the brakes with his left foot,

06:32.579 --> 06:34.979
producing the skid marks
that start up yonder.

06:35.015 --> 06:38.216
Or there's another explanation,
of course, which is that Arkie,

06:38.251 --> 06:41.152
in his perpetual state of inebriation,

06:41.187 --> 06:43.021
falls asleep at the wheel,

06:43.056 --> 06:44.822
waking up to find
that he's going off the highway,

06:44.858 --> 06:46.691
and applying the brakes there.

06:46.726 --> 06:48.726
Yeah, but if he was asleep,
he wouldn't have been traveling

06:48.762 --> 06:50.395
at such a dangerous rate of speed.

06:51.186 --> 06:52.530
You're saying you believe him.

06:52.566 --> 06:55.199
No. I'm just saying that I think
the kid's too stupid

06:55.235 --> 06:56.900
to make it up.

07:03.198 --> 07:04.842
Yes, I treated several

07:04.878 --> 07:06.945
of the victims manifesting the symptoms.

07:06.980 --> 07:09.213
Their episodes suggested a pattern

07:09.249 --> 07:10.415
of shared hallucination.

07:10.450 --> 07:11.883
A distinct narrative.

07:11.918 --> 07:14.886
They all saw their doubles,
doppelgangers.

07:14.921 --> 07:17.422
None of these people had had
psychiatric problems before?

07:17.457 --> 07:20.191
- They never received treatment.
- So there were issues?

07:20.226 --> 07:23.628
No, but they were arguably not
upstanding citizens.

07:23.663 --> 07:25.296
Oh, they had trouble with the law.

07:25.332 --> 07:27.803
Not necessarily connoting that
they were mentally ill.

07:27.839 --> 07:29.567
But, Dr. Russell, your diagnosis is

07:29.603 --> 07:31.903
of a non-conforming type
of schizophrenia.

07:31.938 --> 07:33.738
That was my clinical opinion.

07:34.187 --> 07:35.773
So, they were mentally ill?

07:35.809 --> 07:37.208
They became mentally ill.

07:37.243 --> 07:39.744
It was almost like a kind of outbreak.

07:39.779 --> 07:42.246
So would you say like a mass hysteria?

07:42.696 --> 07:45.249
I've never heard of
a suicidal mass hysteria.

07:45.657 --> 07:47.919
Well, a phenomenon known
as suicide clusters,

07:47.954 --> 07:50.421
or suicide contagion,
have been known to affect

07:50.457 --> 07:52.038
whole communities or social groups.

07:52.074 --> 07:54.659
Are you currently treating any
patients with those symptoms?

07:54.694 --> 07:56.995
Nothing matching that particular
pattern. Why do you ask?

07:57.030 --> 07:59.964
This patient here, what's her
specific psychiatric diagnosis?

08:00.000 --> 08:03.167
Hmm. More a normative schizophrenic.

08:03.203 --> 08:05.131
Can we possibly talk to her?

08:05.166 --> 08:07.192
Well, I'd strongly advise against that.

08:07.225 --> 08:08.803
Why would you say that?

08:08.842 --> 08:10.475
Because she exhibits split personality

08:10.510 --> 08:14.579
with wild swings in affect
from benign to violent.

08:14.614 --> 08:17.582
Unless you've got some good
reason, I'd steer clear.

08:17.617 --> 08:19.917
I'd like to take a look at her drawings.

08:25.458 --> 08:27.529
Judy, you have visitors.

08:27.596 --> 08:28.996
Oh, you should've warned me.

08:29.031 --> 08:30.330
I look awful.

08:30.366 --> 08:31.688
I look a fright.

08:31.724 --> 08:33.111
No one's judging you, Judy.

08:33.111 --> 08:35.211
Ah, not without my coiffure.

08:35.246 --> 08:36.712
You look fine to me.

08:38.962 --> 08:40.274
No, I don't.

08:40.308 --> 08:43.340
I don't. Not for such
a handsome man as yourself.

08:44.549 --> 08:46.790
My name is Fox, and this is Dana.

08:48.345 --> 08:50.393
You can call me Little Judy.

08:50.889 --> 08:52.729
That's what my fans call me.

08:52.764 --> 08:54.431
Are you an actress, Judy?

08:54.466 --> 08:56.811
I'm a very famous actress.

08:58.897 --> 09:00.403
They want to see your drawing.

09:00.439 --> 09:01.938
Would you like to show it to them?

09:01.973 --> 09:04.941
Oh, it's nothing. That's just Hangman.

09:04.976 --> 09:06.776
You play a lot of Hangman.

09:06.812 --> 09:09.437
- I-I play with my brother.
- Does he visit you here?

09:09.473 --> 09:10.947
My brother's an insufferable jerk.

09:10.982 --> 09:12.482
We play telepathically.

09:12.517 --> 09:14.451
"Arkie."

09:15.687 --> 09:18.955
You know a... an Arkie Seavers?

09:18.990 --> 09:21.791
You know, he just,
he had an accident recently.

09:22.504 --> 09:24.494
I don't know an Arkie Seavers.

09:24.881 --> 09:26.496
This is just a coincidence?

09:26.531 --> 09:28.531
I don't know an Arkie Seavers.

09:29.835 --> 09:32.202
But she might.

10:00.479 --> 10:01.665
Hey, listen, man,

10:01.701 --> 10:02.733
wh-where-where are they taking me?

10:02.768 --> 10:05.235
Don't know. Transfer.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.470
Okay, I-I gotta talk to my lawyer first

10:06.505 --> 10:07.805
or something. I-I...

10:07.840 --> 10:09.676
Sorry. Can't help you.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.810
Please, I mean...

10:13.430 --> 10:14.745
O-Okay.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.080
Transfer where?

10:16.433 --> 10:18.282
Like I said, can't help you.

10:30.062 --> 10:32.429
Hey, help, help! He's here!

10:32.465 --> 10:35.566
Please, somebody help me!
Please, please, help me!

10:45.826 --> 10:47.793
Coming.

10:54.986 --> 10:57.086
Hi, we'd like a couple rooms.

10:57.121 --> 10:58.930
- Do you have reservations?
- No.

10:58.966 --> 11:00.756
Uh, do you have any rooms?

11:01.391 --> 11:03.557
I've had a cancellation.
It's just a suite.

11:03.593 --> 11:05.192
We'll take it.

11:08.364 --> 11:10.531
There's a pullout sofa.

11:10.566 --> 11:11.696
Okay.

11:12.906 --> 11:15.302
Just trying to get some shut-eye.

11:15.338 --> 11:17.505
I'm glad to hear it.

11:39.429 --> 11:43.366
Mulder, what are you doing?

11:43.401 --> 11:45.533
That bed nice and comfy?

11:45.568 --> 11:49.103
- Mulder, go back to sleep.
- I wish that I could, Scully.

11:49.138 --> 11:52.139
They just found Arkie Seavers
dead in his jail cell.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.180
Somebody want to explain this to me?

11:59.215 --> 12:01.454
- Who found him there?
- One of the trustees.

12:02.452 --> 12:04.185
That guy.

12:04.220 --> 12:05.453
This happens all the time.

12:05.488 --> 12:06.508
I don't know what to tell you...

12:06.543 --> 12:08.189
Looks like a suicide.

12:08.224 --> 12:09.724
He was strangled to death.

12:09.759 --> 12:12.055
Not necessarily, Mr. Cavalier.

12:12.090 --> 12:14.862
- He's wearing handcuffs.
- It looks impossible

12:14.897 --> 12:16.864
and I admit, it's highly improbable,

12:16.899 --> 12:17.957
but there is ample case history

12:17.982 --> 12:19.734
that it can be done.

12:19.769 --> 12:22.236
The victim simply spins the belt
around, unbuckles it,

12:22.271 --> 12:25.560
fastens it to the bars,
loops it around his neck,

12:25.595 --> 12:27.575
- and uses his body as leverage.
- No, no, no, no.

12:27.610 --> 12:29.744
- Arkie didn't want to die.
- I agree with you.

12:29.779 --> 12:32.609
This is an outrage. Now,
who is gonna stop this carnage?

12:32.644 --> 12:33.943
We're working on it.

12:33.978 --> 12:35.416
Well, someone's got to pay.

12:36.344 --> 12:37.677
Arkie did not want to die.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.783
I know what you're thinking, Mulder.

12:43.818 --> 12:45.318
Anyone up for a gang of Hangman?

12:45.353 --> 12:47.119
It's just a coincidence.

12:47.458 --> 12:49.955
Judy said that she didn't
even know Arkie Seavers.

12:49.991 --> 12:51.657
Not necessarily, Scully.

12:51.693 --> 12:53.359
- Well, she said she didn't know him.
- She said

12:53.394 --> 12:55.780
- that she might.
- She also said

12:55.816 --> 12:58.030
she was playing telepathically
with her brother.

12:58.553 --> 13:00.513
Our suspect number two.

13:27.194 --> 13:28.361
Oh, for God's sakes.

13:30.565 --> 13:33.265
My one damn day off.

13:33.301 --> 13:34.900
Chucky Poundstone?

13:34.936 --> 13:36.068
Speaking to whom?

13:36.104 --> 13:38.134
Fox Mulder. I'm with the FBI.

13:39.844 --> 13:41.207
Oh, yeah.

13:41.242 --> 13:43.519
With that tasty little redhead.

13:43.554 --> 13:47.213
You tapping that, Special Agent,
or can Chucky bust a move?

13:48.018 --> 13:49.517
You're that trustee.

13:49.552 --> 13:51.851
You found the kid hanged
in his jail cell.

13:51.886 --> 13:53.219
Yeah, I discovered the moron.

13:53.254 --> 13:55.121
Kid had loser written all over him.

13:55.156 --> 13:56.736
Can I ask you a few questions?

13:57.258 --> 13:58.924
Why? Am I under suspicion?

13:58.960 --> 14:01.127
It's just a few moments of your time.

14:02.408 --> 14:06.065
Yeah, well, lucky I just tidied up.

14:12.673 --> 14:14.974
I'm just saying, but
you better hope the fire marshal

14:15.009 --> 14:16.776
never comes a-callin'.
He'd red-tag you...

14:16.811 --> 14:17.810
You calling the marshal?!

14:18.941 --> 14:20.479
No. I'm just saying.

14:21.692 --> 14:23.048
Ah.

14:23.680 --> 14:25.435
Talk about my house.

14:25.598 --> 14:28.228
It's this town needs cleaning up.

14:29.991 --> 14:31.891
Seen what you need? Get a sense

14:31.926 --> 14:33.826
of what lurks beneath?

14:33.861 --> 14:35.828
I'm an FBI agent, Mr. Poundstone,

14:35.863 --> 14:37.496
not an archaeologist.

14:37.532 --> 14:39.465
Yeah, well,
I got body parts in the fridge.

14:45.827 --> 14:47.673
You play with your sister?

14:47.708 --> 14:50.443
My sister's a miserable slut
and a damn cheater on top of it.

14:50.478 --> 14:51.510
How does she do that?

14:51.546 --> 14:53.446
She cheats. Breaks the rules.

14:53.481 --> 14:54.413
What are the rules?

14:55.483 --> 14:59.018
What are we, amigos now? Bros?

14:59.053 --> 15:03.789
Is this you deftly profiling the
mind of Charles H. Poundstone?

15:03.825 --> 15:05.860
- It's a simple line of inquiry.
- Yeah, well,

15:05.896 --> 15:08.033
it takes a dipwad to know one.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.467
I take it you're twins.

15:14.502 --> 15:16.836
Ooh! Powers of deduction.

15:16.871 --> 15:17.837
And she's the good twin.

15:20.234 --> 15:23.342
You don't know Little Judy.

15:23.377 --> 15:25.177
Well, begs the question
how you both could play a game

15:25.213 --> 15:28.180
with the name of the deceased
Arkie Seavers in it.

15:28.216 --> 15:30.115
I like the name Arkie.

15:30.580 --> 15:32.885
Funny name for a no-account douche bag.

15:32.920 --> 15:35.187
All right, well, you mind
if I take a picture of your wall

15:35.223 --> 15:36.722
for my records?

15:37.086 --> 15:39.124
Is this guy a numbnuts or what?

15:39.160 --> 15:40.559
You talking to me?

15:40.595 --> 15:43.009
No. I'm talking to him.

15:47.889 --> 15:49.401
Is she expecting me here today?

15:49.437 --> 15:50.903
We told her you were coming.

15:50.938 --> 15:53.272
Then she flung Dookie at us.

15:54.408 --> 15:56.375
So this is the other Judy.

15:56.410 --> 15:59.578
We call her Demon Judy.

16:01.716 --> 16:03.382
Why is the light off?

16:04.037 --> 16:06.051
Makes you a harder target.

16:06.087 --> 16:07.486
Well, sometimes
a split personality responds

16:07.522 --> 16:09.054
to a strong persona who challenges

16:09.090 --> 16:10.689
the childish psychotic.

16:10.725 --> 16:12.830
Both parents hanged themselves.

16:15.500 --> 16:16.929
And you'll come in with me?

16:16.964 --> 16:19.045
- No way.
- Not a chance.

16:28.471 --> 16:29.875
Judy, it's Agent Scully.

16:32.475 --> 16:34.380
I want you to behave yourself.

16:34.415 --> 16:36.815
- I know what you want, bitch.
- I want to know

16:36.851 --> 16:37.871
about Arkie.

16:37.906 --> 16:39.585
Reached the end of his rope.

16:41.055 --> 16:43.255
I'm not afraid of you, Judy.

16:43.291 --> 16:44.757
Oh, yes, you are.

16:44.792 --> 16:48.227
Everybody's afraid of sweet Little Judy.

16:48.262 --> 16:49.428
Is Little Judy a killer?

16:50.201 --> 16:52.298
Little Judy's an angel.

16:52.333 --> 16:53.966
And what about your brother?

16:54.001 --> 16:55.367
Is he involved?

16:55.998 --> 16:57.369
Could be.

16:57.792 --> 17:01.206
Chucky Poundstone is
the Devil's dim-witted disciple.

17:01.242 --> 17:03.275
Did he kill Arkie Seavers?

17:03.311 --> 17:04.777
Arkie Seavers killed himself.

17:04.811 --> 17:06.145
Now, how did you know that, Judy,

17:06.180 --> 17:07.946
if you weren't involved yourself?

17:10.805 --> 17:14.326
Are you trying to trick me, Agent Scully?

17:14.351 --> 17:15.817
I want the killing to stop.

17:16.089 --> 17:17.388
Oh.

17:17.425 --> 17:20.159
Well, don't you have a heart of gold?

17:20.940 --> 17:24.296
What's he see in you,
your handsome partner?

17:24.902 --> 17:28.233
One taste of Little Judy
and he'd forget you even exist.

17:28.269 --> 17:32.771
Maybe I can make you go away, too.

17:33.744 --> 17:35.371
Are you threatening me?

17:38.624 --> 17:40.946
Afraid I'm gonna dirty
your cheap little ensemble?

17:40.982 --> 17:42.915
You're nothing but a hosebag.

17:43.504 --> 17:45.351
How old are you? 40s?

17:45.386 --> 17:46.619
Past your child-bearing years.

17:46.654 --> 17:47.953
You're all dried up,

17:47.989 --> 17:49.855
not even half a woman.

17:49.890 --> 17:52.024
You can't hurt me, Judy.

17:52.059 --> 17:54.293
Nothing hurts like the truth.

18:13.221 --> 18:14.813
Just a minute!

18:22.518 --> 18:24.556
Hey. What'd you find out, Scully?

18:25.463 --> 18:27.326
That Dookie winging past your head

18:27.361 --> 18:29.895
sends a sharp message to your brain.

18:30.468 --> 18:32.064
What message is that?

18:32.099 --> 18:34.101
To gather

18:34.126 --> 18:36.878
the other apes and make war
on your dread enemy.

18:36.924 --> 18:39.338
I believe I'm in touch
with that feeling, Scully.

18:39.373 --> 18:41.947
Really? Did you have Dookie
flung at you, too?

18:41.983 --> 18:43.575
Uh, figuratively.

18:43.611 --> 18:46.645
By the queerest little man
in the queerest little house.

18:46.878 --> 18:48.944
I don't know, Mulder. This Judy,

18:48.980 --> 18:53.015
she has some... malign influence
over these victims,

18:53.050 --> 18:55.579
and I'm at a loss
to figure out what it is.

18:55.614 --> 18:58.398
Yeah, I agree. There is
some evil in the air, Scully.

18:58.398 --> 19:01.399
No, it's not evil... it's mental illness.

19:01.434 --> 19:04.949
There's some kind
of psychic transference.

19:04.985 --> 19:07.197
- I wouldn't rule out ghosts.
- Well...

19:07.233 --> 19:10.575
...except for the fact
that they don't exist?

19:10.610 --> 19:12.277
Of course there are ghosts.

19:12.312 --> 19:14.070
I mean, science has proven
that the stimulation

19:14.106 --> 19:15.750
of the brain's left anterior insula

19:15.786 --> 19:17.682
is linked to the feeling
of a sensed presence

19:17.717 --> 19:19.784
and that repeated stimulation
to an area of the left

19:19.819 --> 19:22.186
temporoparietal junction is what promotes

19:22.222 --> 19:24.088
the sense of a shadowy figure,

19:24.124 --> 19:27.559
collectively known as
the Gastaut-Geschwind syndrome.

19:28.109 --> 19:30.261
Talk about flinging dookie.

19:33.377 --> 19:35.695
Mulder, do you think of me as old?

19:35.730 --> 19:37.402
What? Where is that coming from?

19:38.160 --> 19:40.905
- Well...
- I mean, maybe in dog years. No.

19:40.941 --> 19:42.574
What are you...
what are you talking about?

19:42.609 --> 19:45.209
Well, a woman thinks about these things.

19:45.245 --> 19:47.879
No, Scully, you're...

19:48.587 --> 19:51.749
You still got it going on, you...

19:51.785 --> 19:54.615
You still got some scoot in your boot.

19:55.211 --> 19:56.955
I'm gonna boot you out of here.

19:58.658 --> 20:00.658
Knock three times.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.487
Bloodsucking scumbag.

20:21.522 --> 20:24.482
You think you're gonna point
the finger at me?

20:24.539 --> 20:27.195
_

20:35.426 --> 20:37.862
Four letters, little sister.

20:40.765 --> 20:43.301
Is there an "E"?

20:47.540 --> 20:49.540
I thought so.

21:09.621 --> 21:11.254
Top of the morning, Agent Muldoon.

21:11.290 --> 21:14.624
- What's on your mind?
- I want to know how you do it.

21:14.660 --> 21:16.317
I haven't a clue what you mean.

21:16.317 --> 21:18.770
Is the other Chucky here,
the one I talked to yesterday?

21:18.806 --> 21:21.721
Search me, Agent Muldoon.
I am not my brother's keeper.

21:21.756 --> 21:24.290
It's Mulder. And I think this is an act.

21:24.325 --> 21:26.893
You choose 'em at the jail, don't you?

21:26.928 --> 21:28.828
The losers like Arkie Seavers,
who you hanged,

21:28.863 --> 21:30.897
if not literally, then psychically.

21:30.932 --> 21:33.132
Does that FBI health plan of yours

21:33.168 --> 21:35.902
cover anger management, Agent Mulder?

21:35.937 --> 21:37.837
Who's next, Mr. Poundstone?

21:37.872 --> 21:39.539
You're asking the wrong guy.

21:39.574 --> 21:41.574
I can have you
and your alter ego arrested.

21:41.609 --> 21:43.176
I can have you committed.

21:43.211 --> 21:46.145
- On what legal pretense?
- Intent to commit a crime.

21:46.181 --> 21:49.081
I've seen many a bad jailhouse lawyer

21:49.117 --> 21:52.699
spring far less innocent men
than I, Agent Mulder.

21:52.735 --> 21:54.554
I'd even venture I'd have grounds

21:54.589 --> 21:56.823
to have you censured for abuse of power.

21:56.858 --> 21:58.424
You're going down, Poundstone.

21:58.460 --> 22:00.226
Tell it to the hand, G-man.

22:00.261 --> 22:02.195
Oh, that's original.
I haven't heard that one before.

22:02.230 --> 22:03.563
Before I punch you in the face

22:03.598 --> 22:05.164
and snatch Little Red Riding Hood!

22:05.200 --> 22:08.067
Now, there's the Chucky I came for.

22:08.102 --> 22:11.037
And that's the Chucky who's
eventually gonna hang himself.

22:15.310 --> 22:16.709
Judy, excuse me, hon.

22:16.744 --> 22:18.845
Agent Scully's here to see you.

22:18.880 --> 22:21.282
What brings you here today, Agent Scully?

22:21.318 --> 22:22.882
Do you have any recollection

22:22.917 --> 22:24.884
of our exchange that we had yesterday?

22:26.912 --> 22:28.254
No memory whatsoever?

22:28.789 --> 22:30.857
- You look mad at me.
- I am mad, Judy.

22:30.892 --> 22:32.725
I am... angry

22:32.760 --> 22:35.294
because I need to stop the killings

22:35.330 --> 22:37.411
and I don't know how.

22:37.411 --> 22:39.344
And you blame me, don't you?

22:39.379 --> 22:40.712
Are you to blame?

22:40.747 --> 22:42.580
I'm an actress, Agent Scully.

22:42.616 --> 22:44.883
I've never even played a killer.

22:45.598 --> 22:48.253
Where is the person that
I talked to here yesterday?

22:48.893 --> 22:50.455
Where is that Judy?

22:51.061 --> 22:52.857
She's right over there.

22:52.893 --> 22:55.527
- No, she's not.
- Sure she is. Just look.

22:56.359 --> 22:58.190
No, she isn't, Judy,

22:58.402 --> 23:00.932
and I think that
you're pretending that she is.

23:00.967 --> 23:04.235
You mean I'm pretending so I can
sit here in this bed all day?

23:04.271 --> 23:07.495
I think you have some kind of power

23:07.530 --> 23:09.872
to influence people's lives.

23:11.248 --> 23:13.678
I think you mean their deaths.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.587
Yes.

23:17.713 --> 23:19.651
That's exactly what I mean.

23:22.900 --> 23:25.423
People can protect themselves.

23:25.459 --> 23:28.326
How? Protect themselves how?

23:31.477 --> 23:33.174
By taking these pills.

23:33.210 --> 23:35.895
I take them every day
to protect me from her,

23:35.931 --> 23:37.202
and so far...

23:38.692 --> 23:40.438
...they've worked.

23:40.474 --> 23:42.407
Did the nurses give you these?

23:42.442 --> 23:44.476
Every morning with breakfast.

23:51.914 --> 23:56.221
Would you consider not playing
that game with your brother?

24:00.673 --> 24:02.160
Well... well, what would I do

24:02.195 --> 24:05.223
in here all day, Agent Scully?

24:05.985 --> 24:07.665
I'd go mad.

24:15.479 --> 24:17.308
I have a question for you.

24:17.344 --> 24:21.050
Uh, she said that you give these to her

24:21.086 --> 24:22.724
at breakfast every morning

24:22.760 --> 24:24.716
and that they have secret powers.

24:24.751 --> 24:26.985
That's really only half true.

24:27.020 --> 24:28.186
That you give them to her at breakfast

24:28.221 --> 24:30.221
or that they have secret power?

24:30.257 --> 24:31.456
We bring her bread every morning,

24:31.491 --> 24:32.957
and she rolls it into those pills.

24:34.386 --> 24:36.561
So these are just bread pills.

24:36.596 --> 24:38.363
They have no medicinal qualities.

24:38.398 --> 24:41.046
No. Not that we know of, anyway.

24:45.939 --> 24:47.539
Uh, but we both take them.

24:48.262 --> 24:50.008
In case they have secret power.

24:50.389 --> 24:52.510
You might want to take them, too.

25:04.424 --> 25:06.337
- What'll you have, Dean?
- I'll, uh,

25:06.373 --> 25:08.026
take the lunch special. No mayo.

25:08.061 --> 25:10.094
Salad on the side, lightly dressed.

25:10.130 --> 25:12.689
And if you bat those baby blues at me,

25:12.725 --> 25:15.171
I'll give you a little something
on the side, too.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.603
Well, promises are like bananas...

25:17.639 --> 25:19.437
they're only good when they're appealing.

25:19.473 --> 25:20.872
You know, one day I've got
to have you over to my place

25:20.907 --> 25:22.370
to see my sword collection.

25:22.406 --> 25:24.309
You say that to all the girls.

25:34.120 --> 25:35.920
Hey, did you see that guy?

25:35.956 --> 25:37.288
Did I see what guy?

25:45.665 --> 25:47.765
Cancel the blue plate!

25:53.440 --> 25:55.573
Agent Scully, I saw him.

25:55.609 --> 25:56.975
Hold your horses, Mr. Cavalier.

25:57.010 --> 25:58.409
He looked just like me.

25:58.445 --> 26:00.812
Just calm down and you can tell us both

26:00.847 --> 26:02.614
- what it is that happened.
- All right.

26:02.649 --> 26:03.982
I saw him through a window, the same way

26:04.017 --> 26:05.612
that Arkie said he saw his double.

26:05.647 --> 26:07.719
- Was it the first time?
- No, no. I...

26:07.754 --> 26:10.376
I think I saw him the other day
staring at me from a bus stop.

26:10.412 --> 26:12.425
- You're only making it worse.
- What do you mean

26:12.460 --> 26:14.292
I'm making it worse?
This guy is stalking me.

26:14.327 --> 26:16.294
Your paranoia
is only gonna feed on itself.

26:16.329 --> 26:18.663
Y-You know that mass hysteria
is just a symptom

26:18.698 --> 26:20.431
of fears run wild.

26:20.467 --> 26:22.513
- Well, those people all died.
- While I agree

26:22.549 --> 26:24.646
with Agent Scully's theory,
I do think there's a danger

26:24.681 --> 26:26.604
and you should take
every precaution against it.

26:26.640 --> 26:28.529
All right. So what should I do?

26:32.324 --> 26:34.089
Stay off the interstate?

26:34.124 --> 26:36.525
Do you have a family, Mr. Cavalier?

26:36.560 --> 26:38.693
No, I don't. I live by myself.

26:38.729 --> 26:41.196
Okay, well, maybe stay home,
uh, take some time off work,

26:41.231 --> 26:43.532
- lock your doors, and-and
call the police - Yeah.

26:43.567 --> 26:45.534
If you have another panic attack.

26:45.569 --> 26:47.269
Yeah. Well, that's easy for you to say.

26:47.304 --> 26:49.538
- Take my card.
- And just know

26:49.573 --> 26:52.440
that it can't haunt you
if you don't let it.

26:53.477 --> 26:55.243
Yeah.

26:57.781 --> 26:59.506
Like I said before,

26:59.541 --> 27:03.084
clearly there's a dark influence
set loose in this town, Scully.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.720
Well, by "dark influence," again,

27:05.756 --> 27:08.723
I presume you mean evil, Mulder.

27:09.069 --> 27:11.459
But there is no such thing as evil.

27:11.905 --> 27:15.230
I mean, evil is a concept,
like the Devil.

27:15.265 --> 27:16.965
Oh, the Devil is a concept?

27:17.000 --> 27:18.567
Certainly, that's not what they taught

27:18.602 --> 27:21.636
young Dana Katherine Scully
in Sunday school, is it?

27:21.672 --> 27:23.638
Well, I certainly believed
in the literal Devil

27:23.674 --> 27:26.041
- when I was a child.
- So you don't believe that

27:26.076 --> 27:29.360
we, as humans, have dark sides
that we sublimate or repress?

27:29.395 --> 27:31.646
Well, while anyone
with an imagination can

27:31.682 --> 27:34.883
entertain acting out violence
or antisocial behavior,

27:34.918 --> 27:37.886
that doesn't mean
that there's an evil twin

27:37.921 --> 27:39.754
lurking inside of us.

27:39.790 --> 27:40.989
Speak for yourself, Scully.

27:41.024 --> 27:42.791
And tell that to Chuck and Judy.

27:42.826 --> 27:44.411
Chuck and Judy are mentally ill, Mulder.

27:44.446 --> 27:46.884
- Explain how they're doing it.
- I can't explain it.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.797
But if you eliminate the impossible,

27:48.832 --> 27:52.500
whatever is remaining, even if
improbable, must be the truth.

27:52.536 --> 27:53.728
No sugar, Sherlock.

27:53.753 --> 27:55.191
But I have to admit,

27:55.226 --> 27:57.377
I, uh, still sleep
with my back to the door

27:57.412 --> 27:58.440
just in case the Devil

27:58.465 --> 28:00.370
comes in the night.

28:02.748 --> 28:05.013
Can never be too careful.

29:03.111 --> 29:04.560
Is there an "S"?

29:07.737 --> 29:10.045
Damn you, Chucky Poundstone.

30:02.478 --> 30:04.445
Please, Mulder,

30:04.480 --> 30:07.181
you've got to quit scaring me like that.

30:07.216 --> 30:08.916
Oh, I'd like to quit.

30:17.794 --> 30:19.593
Thank you.

30:19.885 --> 30:22.797
So, neighbors called police

30:22.832 --> 30:24.799
when they saw him acting suspiciously.

30:24.834 --> 30:28.207
He was dumping firearms in the driveway.

30:28.512 --> 30:30.240
I take it the doors were locked
from the inside

30:30.276 --> 30:31.909
- when they arrived?
- Yeah, he wasn't responding.

30:31.944 --> 30:35.979
They looked through the window
and broke in the door.

30:36.015 --> 30:37.481
Has anybody offered up

30:37.516 --> 30:39.750
any evidence for how this could happen?

30:39.785 --> 30:42.753
Well, it seems everyone's
under the agreement

30:42.788 --> 30:45.122
that a man can't cut off his own head.

30:45.157 --> 30:47.391
Oh. Good to see there's still
a shred of sanity left

30:47.426 --> 30:49.726
- in this town.
- But, for the record, I have to say,

30:49.762 --> 30:52.129
it's not outside the realm
of extreme possibility.

30:52.164 --> 30:53.564
Oh, so he just tripped and fell

30:53.599 --> 30:55.399
and splattered the walls with blood?

30:55.434 --> 31:00.337
Well, if he were a determined
man with a razor-sharp sword

31:00.372 --> 31:03.674
set on creating his own
self-fulfilling prophecy...

31:03.709 --> 31:05.976
He was scared out of his mind, Scully.

31:07.513 --> 31:09.813
Well, if he was in his right mind,

31:09.849 --> 31:11.915
- he might've called you.
- Oh.

31:11.951 --> 31:13.650
Maybe he tried.

31:13.686 --> 31:15.691
Only he lost his head.

31:35.627 --> 31:37.574
You coming, Scully?

32:04.370 --> 32:06.370
Oh. Speak of the devil.

32:06.405 --> 32:07.971
I can't sleep, Mulder.

32:08.007 --> 32:09.873
What's the problem?

32:09.909 --> 32:13.977
Something about this
case is getting under my skin.

32:14.013 --> 32:17.214
Well, we've had stranger cases, Scully.

32:17.836 --> 32:19.816
Can you hold me?

32:21.214 --> 32:23.287
Yeah. I can do that.

32:37.603 --> 32:39.024
What's gonna happen?

32:39.872 --> 32:42.172
What's gonna happen when?

32:42.208 --> 32:44.154
When we're old.

32:45.277 --> 32:47.157
What do you mean "when"?

32:52.918 --> 32:54.080
I mean...

32:56.750 --> 32:59.356
sooner or later we're gonna retire and...

32:59.391 --> 33:00.837
Hmm.

33:02.328 --> 33:05.362
Are we gonna spend time together?

33:05.397 --> 33:09.466
I'll come push your wheelchair
with my wheelchair.

33:11.723 --> 33:13.604
That's not what I mean.

33:13.639 --> 33:15.872
Oh, I'll always be around, Scully.

33:15.908 --> 33:18.375
Offering bulletproof theories of genius

33:18.410 --> 33:21.775
that you fail to assail with
your inadequate rationality.

33:22.681 --> 33:26.950
And I'll always be around
to prove you wrong.

33:26.986 --> 33:28.323
Hmm.

33:29.288 --> 33:31.188
Promise.

33:32.291 --> 33:34.224
No, but that's not what I mean.

33:34.260 --> 33:35.831
What do you mean?

33:41.767 --> 33:43.713
What if you meet someone?

33:45.337 --> 33:48.505
What if you meet someone...

33:48.540 --> 33:52.776
younger who... wants to have kids?

33:53.515 --> 33:55.350
Oh, that's what you mean.

33:55.948 --> 34:00.284
Well... you could do the same.

34:00.319 --> 34:04.087
You could meet someone and... have kids.

34:04.123 --> 34:07.457
Mulder, that's not gonna happen.

34:07.493 --> 34:09.860
That's nonsense.

34:09.895 --> 34:11.695
No, it's not.

34:11.730 --> 34:15.197
I'm... I'm at the end of that journey.

34:15.234 --> 34:17.266
Do you want to have more kids?

34:17.303 --> 34:18.956
Well...

34:20.583 --> 34:23.085
I would have liked to have had
another one.

34:23.542 --> 34:24.880
Mm.

34:25.978 --> 34:28.344
At the risk of sounding insensitive,

34:28.380 --> 34:30.981
what's stopping you?

34:31.016 --> 34:32.469
Mmm...

34:33.851 --> 34:36.987
besides the fact that
the first time was a miracle?

34:37.022 --> 34:41.024
And besides the fact
that I don't have anyone

34:41.060 --> 34:43.648
to have one with even if I could?

34:47.399 --> 34:50.701
You're a woman of science.

34:50.735 --> 34:53.370
Mulder, sometimes I think
the world is going to hell

34:53.405 --> 34:56.306
and that we're the only two
people who can save it.

34:56.342 --> 34:58.809
The world is going to hell, Scully.

34:58.844 --> 35:02.546
The president working to bring
down the FBI along with it.

35:02.581 --> 35:05.295
What if we lose our jobs?

35:09.174 --> 35:11.755
Yeah. Then what would we do?

35:25.148 --> 35:27.437
We'll think of something.

35:44.423 --> 35:45.722
All right.

35:45.758 --> 35:47.462
Is there an "L"?

35:49.215 --> 35:53.383
I said, is there an "L"?

35:57.636 --> 35:59.936
Are we playing or not, Chuck-face?

35:59.972 --> 36:01.665
Earth to Judith.

36:01.690 --> 36:05.772
Yes, Your Royal Highness,
there is an "L."

36:46.482 --> 36:49.664
- Scully, get up. Get dressed.
- Mmm, come back to bed.

36:49.689 --> 36:50.755
They're coming after me.

36:51.651 --> 36:53.324
What are you talking about?

36:53.359 --> 36:55.660
I was looking in the mirror,
and there he was.

36:55.695 --> 36:57.428
There I was.

36:57.463 --> 36:58.407
It wasn't my reflection.

36:58.432 --> 36:59.664
- It was my double.
- I know.

36:59.699 --> 37:02.398
- I-I-I saw my double, too.
- They're targeting us both.

37:02.423 --> 37:03.389
That's how they operate, Mulder.

37:03.424 --> 37:04.790
I know how they operate.

37:04.826 --> 37:06.465
You're just playing into it.

37:06.501 --> 37:08.103
Spare me the pop psychology, okay?

37:08.104 --> 37:10.782
- Mulder, you have to calm down.
- Scully.

37:10.817 --> 37:12.717
Scully, put a dimmer on
that afterglow and get yourself

37:12.753 --> 37:14.552
to the hospital before they hang us both.

37:14.588 --> 37:16.021
Mulder, they can't hang us.

37:16.056 --> 37:18.089
We-we can only hang ourselves
if we panic.

37:18.125 --> 37:19.758
How many letters in Scully, Scully?

37:24.965 --> 37:26.998
Is there another "L"?

37:28.902 --> 37:30.368
What do you mean, no?

37:30.404 --> 37:33.531
So throw a hissy. One "L".

37:33.566 --> 37:35.573
You know you're in love with him.

37:35.609 --> 37:39.244
Double "L," Chuck-face.

37:39.279 --> 37:42.280
Who's the one in love?

38:16.817 --> 38:18.183
Chucky Poundstone!

38:18.218 --> 38:20.151
No letter "C," super freak.

38:25.158 --> 38:28.793
- I know you're in here.
- I said, no letter "C."

38:28.829 --> 38:30.662
You're under arrest, Chucky!

38:30.697 --> 38:32.464
Put the pencil down.

38:36.736 --> 38:39.070
Who's the cheater now?

38:51.151 --> 38:54.786
My rational mind knows that you
are only a...

38:54.821 --> 38:56.888
a manifest psychic ideation

38:56.923 --> 38:59.190
borne of latent hostility.

38:59.226 --> 39:01.493
Maybe Mulder was right,

39:01.528 --> 39:03.825
you're evil incarnate.

39:04.157 --> 39:06.224
It's all you are.

39:18.909 --> 39:20.512
Step aside.

39:21.217 --> 39:22.580
I'm coming through.

39:42.602 --> 39:44.269
Is there a "J"?

39:44.304 --> 39:45.684
Oh, look,

39:45.720 --> 39:47.077
and a "D,"

39:47.113 --> 39:49.941
and an I-T-H.

39:51.414 --> 39:52.911
Is there a...

39:52.946 --> 39:57.582
C-H-U-C-K-Y?

40:24.277 --> 40:26.778
- I don't want to go in there.
- Not going in there.

40:34.746 --> 40:37.418
Judy, open the door.

40:38.825 --> 40:40.797
Judy!

40:59.879 --> 41:01.112
Judy?

41:04.110 --> 41:06.190
Nurses, get in here!

41:09.461 --> 41:11.286
Get Dr. Russell.

41:40.353 --> 41:44.022
So I was thinking maybe we could
get a couple hours in

41:44.057 --> 41:45.278
before checkout time?

41:47.238 --> 41:49.894
I'm just talking about getting
some shut-eye.

41:50.616 --> 41:52.397
I'm glad to hear that, Mulder.

41:52.432 --> 41:53.703
Yeah.

41:54.401 --> 41:57.869
Uh, I guess I should hit the hay.

41:58.499 --> 42:00.335
- Okay.
- Yeah.

42:00.940 --> 42:03.908
But if you need anything,
you just, uh, call me.

42:03.943 --> 42:06.007
I can't imagine that I will.

42:24.597 --> 42:25.902
But then again,

42:26.533 --> 42:30.490
it's not out of the realm
of extreme possibility.
