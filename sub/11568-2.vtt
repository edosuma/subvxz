00:45.112 --> 00:46.678
With the money from
the fire insurance,

00:46.680 --> 00:49.248
I was able to give you
an open-concept living room.

00:49.250 --> 00:53.819
I added a half-bath,
and I was even able
to convert the garage

00:53.821 --> 00:56.822

you've always wanted!

00:56.824 --> 00:58.624

to see the big reveal?

Oh, for Godsakes,
I've had to go to the
bathroom for 20 minutes.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.665
Please, Marquess, hurry!

01:06.667 --> 01:08.600
Oh, no, I can't
hold it any longer!

01:08.602 --> 01:11.570

hold it. I have to
go so bad. Oh, God...

What? No, it doesn't.
Are you blind?

01:23.851 --> 01:26.919
Oh. Just great. There goes
my (BLEEP) reveal.

01:26.921 --> 01:31.290
I spent $200 of my own money
on this giant (BLEEP) scrim.

did you do that's different?

01:34.762 --> 01:37.463

I changed... Uh! Oh, my God...

01:37.465 --> 01:39.665
I changed the cathedral
windows to bay windows.

know what? I need a drink.

cook more now.

you're upstairs! But
maybe also the basement?

02:01.455 --> 02:04.123
Michael! We don't
have a basement.

02:04.125 --> 02:06.692

what the (BLEEP)?

02:08.362 --> 02:11.396

PIGEON: You care
to (BLEEP) explain
this, Marquess?

02:33.320 --> 02:36.088
Oh, finally!
Someone gives a (BLEEP).

02:36.090 --> 02:41.059
Yes. This is my
favorite new addition.
The wall of family photos!

02:41.061 --> 02:44.763
We didn't have one before,
and I truly think it's what
makes a house a home.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.064
Then where am I?

02:46.066 --> 02:48.467

you were just a little girl.

not doing a flashback?
