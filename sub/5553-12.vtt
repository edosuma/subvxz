WEBVTT

00:02.235 --> 00:04.469
SHELDON: I'm glad to see
you made it safely.

00:04.471 --> 00:05.904
How's your hotel?

00:05.906 --> 00:09.141
It's not the best Best Western
I've been to,

00:09.143 --> 00:10.876
but I'd say it's...

00:10.878 --> 00:13.879
the third best Best Western
I've been to.

00:13.881 --> 00:15.514
I know how you feel.

00:15.516 --> 00:19.518
The Best Buy by my house
is only the third best Best Buy.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.253
They have
the best buys,

00:21.255 --> 00:23.989
but having the best buys
isn't the only thing

00:23.991 --> 00:27.292
that makes a Best Buy
the best Best Buy.

00:28.329 --> 00:32.030
What makes a best Best Buy
the best Best Buy?

00:32.031 --> 00:33.332
Mm, that's a great question.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.901
I like when they're
next to a Chipotle.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.738
Okay, well, I should unpack.

00:39.740 --> 00:40.706
All right.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.608
Enjoy the neurobiology
conference.

00:42.610 --> 00:43.775
I will.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.378
I... wish you were here.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.380
At a neurobiology conference?

00:48.382 --> 00:50.549
What a mean thing to say.

00:51.585 --> 00:55.153
Okay, I'm glad you're <i> not</i> here?

00:55.155 --> 00:57.155
Aw, you always know
just what to say

00:57.157 --> 00:59.258
after I tell you what to say.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.727
Good-bye, Sheldon.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.061
Bye.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.863
Oh! Good news, gentlemen.

01:04.864 --> 01:06.732
Amy's at a conference
this weekend,

01:06.734 --> 01:10.202
which means I'm available
to be entertained, hmm.

01:10.204 --> 01:14.840
As today's youth might put it:
Who wants to get their Sheld-on?

01:14.842 --> 01:17.943
Bernie and I are getting
the house ready for the remodel.

01:17.945 --> 01:20.045
We could always use
an extra pair of hands.

01:20.047 --> 01:22.347
That sounds awful. Raj?

01:22.349 --> 01:25.117
Uh, I've got time booked in
the telescope room all weekend

01:25.119 --> 01:26.218
scanning for rogue planets.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.920
You're more than welcome
to join me.

01:27.922 --> 01:29.888
That's the one to beat.
Leonard?

01:29.890 --> 01:33.492
Oh, if anything,
I'm trying to get my Sheld-off.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.961
Well, then it looks like we have
a winner. Congratulations.

01:35.963 --> 01:38.697
Well, I should warn you,
it's just looking at data

01:38.699 --> 01:40.933
for hours and hours
on a computer screen.

01:40.935 --> 01:43.201
Uh, stop selling it, kid.
You won.

02:13.283 --> 02:14.115
Hey.

02:14.117 --> 02:15.355
Hey.
Hello. - Hi.

02:15.356 --> 02:16.522
How was your day?

02:16.524 --> 02:17.623
Oh, not good.

02:17.625 --> 02:19.825
Still couldn't get in
to see Dr. Gallo.

02:19.827 --> 02:21.427
A doctor?

02:22.397 --> 02:23.863
Well, I hope
you're not contagious.

02:23.865 --> 02:25.931
I've got a weekend
in the telescope room

02:25.933 --> 02:28.601
I've been excited about
for almost three minutes.

02:30.204 --> 02:31.470
I'm not sick.
It's for work.

02:31.472 --> 02:33.806
There's this doctor who refuses
to see any sales reps.

02:33.808 --> 02:35.441
I've been trying
to get in for months.

02:35.443 --> 02:36.976
Well, did you try
wearing the shirt

02:36.978 --> 02:38.611
I said was
inappropriate for work?

02:38.613 --> 02:41.447
Well, the doctor's a woman,
but...

02:41.449 --> 02:43.649
yes, because
you never know.

02:44.652 --> 02:46.085
What kind of doctor
is she?

02:46.087 --> 02:48.087
Um, a psychiatrist. Why?

02:48.089 --> 02:50.489
Well, what if you make
an appointment as a patient?

02:50.491 --> 02:52.224
Then you'll get to talk to her.

02:52.226 --> 02:54.326
Yeah, they already know
I'm a pharmaceutical sales rep.

02:54.328 --> 02:56.028
Oh. What if Leonard
made an appointment

02:56.030 --> 02:58.063
and tried to lay some
groundwork for you?

02:58.065 --> 02:59.498
That's interesting.

02:59.500 --> 03:01.267
I'm not gonna make
a fake appointment

03:01.269 --> 03:02.234
with a psychiatrist.

03:02.236 --> 03:04.003
What would I say
is wrong with me?

03:04.005 --> 03:05.538
Low self-esteem.
Social anxiety.

03:05.540 --> 03:07.873
Sexual insecurity.

03:07.875 --> 03:10.309
None of that is true.

03:10.311 --> 03:13.145
Uh, denial. See, sweetie,
the list goes on and on.

03:13.147 --> 03:14.680
That's just crazy.

03:14.682 --> 03:16.782
How would my going in there
even help you?

03:16.784 --> 03:19.084
I don't know. You could talk to
her, and maybe if it comes up,

03:19.086 --> 03:20.486
you could ask if she's heard
about the drug.

03:20.488 --> 03:21.720
What if I get caught?

03:21.722 --> 03:23.155
Fear of failure!
Lack of confidence!

03:23.157 --> 03:25.057
Kind of a wuss!

03:26.527 --> 03:27.726
Fine, I'll do it.

03:27.728 --> 03:30.262
But not because of them,
because I love you.

03:30.264 --> 03:30.996
Thank you.

03:30.998 --> 03:32.198
Pushover.
Spineless.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.098
Still hasn't bought milk

03:33.100 --> 03:35.034
even though I told him
two days ago!

03:39.941 --> 03:41.907
That was incredible.

03:41.909 --> 03:43.409
It was.

03:43.411 --> 03:45.411
I just wish Stuart
wasn't around

03:45.413 --> 03:47.480
so we didn't have
to be so quiet.

03:47.482 --> 03:48.914
I know.

03:48.916 --> 03:50.649
It's not like
he returns the favor

03:50.651 --> 03:54.153
when he watches
his Japanese porn cartoons.

03:55.323 --> 03:57.223
(knocking)
STUART: You guys got a minute,

03:57.225 --> 03:58.791
or are you
still cuddling?

03:58.793 --> 04:00.226
(mouthing)

04:00.228 --> 04:01.760
What is it, Stuart?

04:01.762 --> 04:03.429
STUART:
Can I come in?

04:03.431 --> 04:04.730
Hang on.

04:04.732 --> 04:06.765
(quietly):
Should I send him away?

04:06.767 --> 04:08.000
No, it's okay.

04:08.002 --> 04:10.536
STUART:
Thanks, Bernie.

04:12.907 --> 04:14.406
What's up?

04:14.408 --> 04:16.075
Uh, well, I know

04:16.077 --> 04:18.511
the remodel is coming up,
so I thought I'd make it easy

04:18.512 --> 04:20.779
on you guys
and find my own place.

04:20.781 --> 04:22.648
Wow. (chuckles)

04:22.650 --> 04:25.718
I thought I was done
getting lucky tonight.

04:25.720 --> 04:28.053
So, when are you
thinking of moving?

04:28.055 --> 04:29.855
Uh, actually,
I already found an apartment,

04:29.857 --> 04:31.457
so in a couple of days.

04:31.459 --> 04:34.660
Oh. Okay.

04:34.662 --> 04:37.229
Sorry to see you go?

04:37.231 --> 04:40.900
Okay, well,
thank you guys for everything.

04:40.902 --> 04:42.835
I-I really appreciate it.

04:42.837 --> 04:43.969
You're very welcome.

04:46.841 --> 04:47.873
Hmm.

04:47.875 --> 04:49.642
What?

04:49.644 --> 04:53.312
Hmm, I just have never been
in this room while you're awake.

04:55.816 --> 04:57.850
(door closes)

05:03.791 --> 05:05.891
What are you doing?

05:05.893 --> 05:09.695
Uh, making sure the telescope's
camera is white-field balanced.

05:09.697 --> 05:11.463
Hmm.

05:11.465 --> 05:13.432
What are you doing now?

05:13.434 --> 05:15.901
Still making sure
the telescope's camera

05:15.903 --> 05:18.938
is white-field balanced.
Oh, I see.

05:22.643 --> 05:24.610
How about now?

05:24.612 --> 05:27.279
Now I'm making sure
the telescope's camera

05:27.281 --> 05:30.349
is white-field balanced and
wishing you had a coloring book.

05:30.351 --> 05:32.785
Well, I can be helpful.

05:32.787 --> 05:34.253
Give me something to do.

05:34.255 --> 05:36.522
You know, my father
took me to work once,

05:36.524 --> 05:38.157
and in ten minutes
I figured out

05:38.159 --> 05:39.858
who'd been stealing
from the cash register.

05:39.860 --> 05:40.960
It was my father.

05:40.962 --> 05:43.462
Yeah, Dad lost his job,

05:43.464 --> 05:47.132
but Mr. Hinckley
gave me a Fudgsicle.

05:47.134 --> 05:49.468
Fine, you want
something to do?

05:49.470 --> 05:52.705
There's about six months
of data on this hard drive.

05:52.707 --> 05:54.773
Why don't you go through it
and see if you can spot

05:54.775 --> 05:55.808
any patterns or anomalies.

05:55.810 --> 05:58.077
Yep, I'm on it.
Hey, look at that!

05:58.079 --> 06:02.281
An Indian guy outsourcing
a computer job to a white fella.

06:02.283 --> 06:04.783
Yeah, okay,
whatever it takes

06:04.785 --> 06:06.619
to keep you busy
for a few hours.

06:06.621 --> 06:09.455
Found one.

06:09.457 --> 06:10.556
No, you didn't.

06:10.558 --> 06:13.125
There are millions
of data points there.

06:13.127 --> 06:15.861
But, look, an
optical transient.

06:15.863 --> 06:17.463
Yeah, maybe
that <i> is</i> something.

06:17.465 --> 06:19.765
How did you find that?
It wasn't difficult.

06:19.767 --> 06:23.002
You know how when you see
prime numbers, they appear red,

06:23.004 --> 06:24.637
but when they're
twin primes,

06:24.639 --> 06:26.739
they're pink and
smell like gasoline?

06:28.275 --> 06:29.708
No.

06:29.710 --> 06:32.911
Oh. I guess I'm
a special boy.

06:32.913 --> 06:35.614
You know, sometimes
when a boy is special,

06:35.616 --> 06:37.549
he gets a Fudgsicle.

06:37.551 --> 06:40.719
Which, by the way, tastes
like the speed of light.

06:43.424 --> 06:45.824
Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

06:45.826 --> 06:47.226
Ah, it's my pleasure.

06:47.228 --> 06:48.227
I'm curious,

06:48.229 --> 06:51.063
are you related
to Dr. Beverly Hofstadter?

06:51.065 --> 06:53.565
Uh, she's my mother.
You know her?

06:53.567 --> 06:54.667
No, not personally,

06:54.669 --> 06:56.669
but I have read
all of her books.

06:56.671 --> 06:58.804
Well, then you know her
better than I do.

06:58.806 --> 07:00.706
Well, I'm not so sure
about that.

07:00.708 --> 07:03.108
But I can tell you
I do not agree

07:03.110 --> 07:05.944
with her theories
on child rearing at all.

07:05.946 --> 07:08.147
Really?

07:08.149 --> 07:10.883
Any chance you find them
cold, cruel and unsuitable

07:10.885 --> 07:14.386
for innocent little boys
who just want to be happy?

07:14.388 --> 07:15.821
Well, I didn't want to say it...

07:15.823 --> 07:17.289
No, no, say it. Sing it.

07:17.291 --> 07:20.325
Rent a plane,
write it in the sky.

07:20.327 --> 07:21.794
Sounds like you're holding on

07:21.796 --> 07:24.329
to quite a bit of anger
towards her.

07:24.331 --> 07:25.364
Oh, no,
I-I've worked through

07:25.366 --> 07:26.765
a lot of that stuff;
I'm better now.

07:26.767 --> 07:27.800
Mm. Good for you.

07:27.802 --> 07:29.234
Do you know she never let me

07:29.236 --> 07:30.936
celebrate my birthday
because being born

07:30.938 --> 07:33.939
was her achievement, not mine?

07:33.941 --> 07:35.174
That's heartbreaking.

07:35.176 --> 07:38.477
Right? To this day,
I send her a card every year

07:38.479 --> 07:41.080
with a little money in it.

07:42.249 --> 07:45.584
You know, once we get
the house back to ourselves,

07:45.586 --> 07:48.587
we can be romantic
in any room we want.

07:48.589 --> 07:51.890
Great. I can finally show you
where the laundry room is.

07:53.761 --> 07:55.694
Boy, who
would've thought

07:55.696 --> 07:58.430
when you asked me to move in
and help take care of your mom,

07:58.432 --> 07:59.932
I'd still be here
two years later?

07:59.934 --> 08:02.801
Nobody thought that.
No one.

08:04.171 --> 08:05.704
Well, that's it.

08:05.706 --> 08:07.339
I guess so.

08:09.043 --> 08:11.410
This is weird.
(chuckles)

08:11.412 --> 08:15.347
Yeah. A grown man moving
into his own apartment.

08:15.349 --> 08:17.249
Crazy times. See ya!

08:19.320 --> 08:20.853
Ignore him.

08:20.855 --> 08:23.055
He's just using humor
to express how...

08:23.057 --> 08:25.190
happy he is.

08:25.192 --> 08:27.593
It's okay. I know he loves me.

08:27.595 --> 08:29.595
Sure he does.

08:32.433 --> 08:34.866
Well, let us know
when you're all settled in.

08:34.869 --> 08:38.636
I will. And I really can't
thank you guys enough.

08:38.639 --> 08:40.371
(engine starts)
Our pleasure.

08:40.374 --> 08:42.707
Bye.
Bye.

08:44.879 --> 08:46.345
WOLOWITZ:
He's gone!

08:46.347 --> 08:48.881
Let's start in the garage!

08:50.000 --> 08:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:00.970 --> 09:04.238
Okay, so once we receive
the next image

09:04.240 --> 09:06.174
and compare it to the ones
we've already collected,

09:06.176 --> 09:07.809
we'll know what it is
that we found.

09:07.811 --> 09:11.612
Ooh, perhaps it's a
Heliosheath scintillation.

09:11.614 --> 09:13.915
It could be
a trans-Neptunian object.

09:13.917 --> 09:15.917
Maybe it's a new planet.

09:15.919 --> 09:18.319
Unlikely, but it could be
a dwarf planet.

09:18.321 --> 09:19.854
Well, as long as it has
a healthy gravity

09:19.856 --> 09:21.422
and all its moons,
I'll be happy.

09:21.424 --> 09:25.393
Okay, the final image
is coming in.

09:25.395 --> 09:27.361
And the object
we discovered is...

09:27.363 --> 09:28.763
Come on,

09:28.765 --> 09:32.767
Daddy needs a livable planet
he can rule with an iron fist.

09:33.870 --> 09:35.436
A medium-sized asteroid.

09:35.438 --> 09:36.838
That's it?

09:36.840 --> 09:38.339
How common.

09:38.341 --> 09:41.876
That's the chicken fingers
on the menu of space.

09:41.878 --> 09:43.644
I kind of like chicken fingers.

09:43.646 --> 09:46.214
Yeah, me, too.
I was stuck for a metaphor.

09:46.216 --> 09:48.549
Come on,
a medium-sized asteroid

09:48.551 --> 09:50.484
is still
an interesting discovery.

09:50.486 --> 09:52.186
I suppose it
could end up

09:52.188 --> 09:55.990
on a collision course with Earth
and destroy life as we know it.

09:55.992 --> 09:58.559
You dream different than me.

10:00.396 --> 10:02.096
It is kind of cute.

10:02.098 --> 10:04.265
Yeah, it is.
And you know we get to name it.

10:04.267 --> 10:05.399
(gasps)

10:05.401 --> 10:07.768
We better choose a name
no one can make fun of.

10:07.770 --> 10:11.239
Sir Frederick William Herschel
didn't do Uranus any favors.

10:15.044 --> 10:16.844
Hi.

10:16.846 --> 10:18.679
Hey, how'd it go?
Oh, great.

10:18.681 --> 10:20.848
Dr. Gallo is terrific.

10:20.850 --> 10:22.216
You know,
I-I've always been insecure

10:22.218 --> 10:24.118
that no one cares
about what I have to say,

10:24.120 --> 10:25.319
but she made me see...

10:25.321 --> 10:28.089
Yeah, no one cares.
Did you help me out or not?

10:28.091 --> 10:30.191
Okay, n-now,
what I'm hearing

10:30.193 --> 10:32.360
is that you feel that
I sometimes take too long

10:32.362 --> 10:33.694
to express myself,

10:33.696 --> 10:35.463
and you wish
I'd be more succinct.

10:35.465 --> 10:36.497
You're only hearing that because

10:36.499 --> 10:38.733
I cannot roll my eyes
any louder.

10:38.735 --> 10:41.802
All right, well, after we talked
about my issues with my mother--

10:41.804 --> 10:44.538
nothing too deep,
just how she ruined my life--

10:44.540 --> 10:45.907
I told her about you

10:45.909 --> 10:48.142
and your drug; she said
she'd be happy to meet you.

10:48.144 --> 10:49.243
Really?

10:49.245 --> 10:51.913
Oh, you're the best
husband ever!

10:51.915 --> 10:55.917
So you'll go to the Doctor Who
convention with me next week?

10:55.919 --> 10:57.485
I guess.

10:57.487 --> 11:01.589
Oh, I actually did hear
your eyes roll that time.

11:02.792 --> 11:05.059
(vacuum whirring)

11:05.061 --> 11:07.428
Boy, when was the last time
Stuart cleaned this place?

11:07.430 --> 11:08.796
No kidding.

11:08.798 --> 11:10.631
Oh, okay,
I'm about to suck something up.

11:10.633 --> 11:12.733
What do you think
this object sounds like?

11:12.735 --> 11:15.970
Howie, I don't want to play
Lego, Toenail or Pill anymore.

11:17.040 --> 11:20.274
So, what do you think we
should do with this room?

11:20.276 --> 11:22.677
Well, I was thinking a
home theater or a gaming room--

11:22.679 --> 11:24.912
you know, like a man cave.

11:24.914 --> 11:26.380
Why can't it be a woman cave?

11:26.382 --> 11:28.416
As long as it has a home
theater, a video game system

11:28.418 --> 11:29.517
and you're not allowed in it,

11:29.519 --> 11:31.752
you can call it
whatever you want.

11:31.754 --> 11:33.754
I'm being serious.

11:33.756 --> 11:35.990
Well, what do you think
we should do?

11:35.992 --> 11:37.091
I don't know,

11:37.093 --> 11:39.560
maybe a home office or...

11:39.562 --> 11:41.028
Oh.

11:41.030 --> 11:42.463
Look.

11:42.465 --> 11:45.399
The teddy bear Stuart won the
night we took him to the fair.

11:45.401 --> 11:46.600
(chuckles):
Oh.

11:47.503 --> 11:49.670
He was so excited.

11:49.672 --> 11:50.905
Yeah.

11:50.907 --> 11:52.673
You know, no matter
how hard they tried,

11:52.675 --> 11:55.409
they could not guess his age.

11:55.411 --> 11:58.112
I'll give it to him
next time I see him.

11:58.114 --> 11:59.785
Have you heard from him
since he left?

11:59.809 --> 12:01.003
No.

12:01.184 --> 12:04.051
You'd think he would've called
once he got settled in.

12:04.053 --> 12:05.753
Hmm. Maybe he's busy.

12:05.755 --> 12:07.288
Too busy to call?
He wasn't too busy

12:07.290 --> 12:10.591
to binge-watch <i> Hot in Cleveland</i>
with my Hulu password.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.662
What is happening?

12:14.664 --> 12:17.164
Are we missing him?

12:17.166 --> 12:20.768
No, that's not what
this feeling is.

12:20.770 --> 12:22.937
Is it?

12:22.939 --> 12:25.339
Of course not.
He drove us crazy.

12:25.341 --> 12:27.141
Like when you were gonna
make that pie

12:27.143 --> 12:30.745
and Stuart ate
all the blueberries. (scoffs)

12:30.747 --> 12:33.981
And he tried to deny it, but
his teeth were all purple.

12:35.752 --> 12:37.718
That was pretty cute.
(chuckles)

12:37.720 --> 12:39.920
Yeah.

12:39.922 --> 12:41.722
Ew, we <i> are</i> missing him!

12:44.660 --> 12:47.828
So I was thinking,
maybe we can come up with a name

12:47.830 --> 12:50.464
for the asteroid by
combining our names.

12:50.466 --> 12:51.932
That's a great idea.

12:51.934 --> 12:53.434
I've got it.

12:53.436 --> 12:56.303
We'll call it... Cooper.

12:58.141 --> 12:59.774
How is that both our names?

12:59.776 --> 13:03.878
"Koo" from Koothrappali
and "per" from Cooper.

13:03.880 --> 13:06.547
Yeah, s-so it's, like,
Kooper with a "K"?

13:06.549 --> 13:08.249
Nah, you're right, that's dumb.

13:09.252 --> 13:10.584
Hey.

13:10.586 --> 13:11.986
Oh, Leonard, great news.

13:11.988 --> 13:15.423
We discovered a medium-sized
asteroid together.

13:15.425 --> 13:17.124
Wow, that's amazing!

13:17.126 --> 13:19.193
I'm in a pretty great mood
today myself.

13:19.195 --> 13:22.196
Okay. Guess we're gonna
talk about you now.

13:22.198 --> 13:25.099
Well, we are, because
Dr. Gallo made me realize

13:25.101 --> 13:27.868
that I'm a worthwhile person
and that my feelings matter.

13:27.870 --> 13:31.872
I learned that for free from
a cat poster, but good for you.

13:34.010 --> 13:35.276
Okay, back to me.

13:35.278 --> 13:38.179
I discovered an asteroid,
and now I get to name it.

13:38.181 --> 13:39.880
Wait, what happened to us?

13:39.882 --> 13:41.115
Now, this isn't about us,

13:41.117 --> 13:43.284
this is about what's best
for the asteroid.

13:44.821 --> 13:46.754
What are you thinking
of naming it?

13:46.756 --> 13:48.456
I haven't settled
on anything yet.

13:48.458 --> 13:50.291
<i>We</i> haven't settled
on anything yet.

13:50.293 --> 13:53.828
All right, way to go,
Cat Poster. You hang in there.

13:53.830 --> 13:56.363
You know what'd be nice?
Name it after your girlfriends.

13:56.365 --> 13:57.932
Show them how much you care.

13:57.934 --> 14:00.334
That is a great idea.

14:00.336 --> 14:01.635
It's perfect.

14:01.637 --> 14:03.938
It appears romantic,
but it's really just

14:03.940 --> 14:05.206
a rock in space that gets me

14:05.208 --> 14:06.740
out of Valentine's Day
forever.

14:09.078 --> 14:11.579
So, uh, what were you thinking?
Combine their names?

14:11.581 --> 14:12.880
I like it.

14:12.882 --> 14:15.916
Yeah, we'll take the "A-M"
from Amy and, uh,

14:15.918 --> 14:18.652
the "Y" from Emily.

14:19.589 --> 14:21.288
That's just Amy.

14:21.290 --> 14:23.491
Exactly.
See how well we work together?

14:25.695 --> 14:27.394
And in double-blind
studies,

14:27.396 --> 14:29.730
Placinex proved extremely
effective in treating

14:29.732 --> 14:31.332
all kinds of anxiety.

14:31.334 --> 14:33.501
Actually, funny story--
the boys in the lab

14:33.503 --> 14:36.203
were worried about getting
FDA approval for Placinex;

14:36.205 --> 14:38.439
they started taking it,
stopped worrying.

14:39.842 --> 14:41.442
Got it.

14:41.444 --> 14:42.776
Uh, do you have any questions?

14:42.778 --> 14:45.146
Just one.
Mm-hmm?

14:45.148 --> 14:47.214
When you made your husband
pretend to be a patient

14:47.216 --> 14:51.752
so you could get access to me,
what were you thinking there?

14:53.055 --> 14:56.023
I just... meant a question
about the drug.

14:57.827 --> 14:58.959
Yeah, I know what you meant.

14:58.961 --> 15:00.427
Let's put that aside
for a minute

15:00.429 --> 15:03.097
and talk about
why you married Leonard.

15:03.099 --> 15:05.533
(whispers):
I don't wanna.

15:07.303 --> 15:09.570
Here is a man
raised by an overbearing woman

15:09.572 --> 15:13.407
who completely dominated every
aspect of his formative years.

15:13.409 --> 15:15.342
Do you think

15:15.344 --> 15:16.844
he's perpetuating
that relationship

15:16.846 --> 15:19.880
by seeking out
a partner like you?

15:21.350 --> 15:24.652
You know,
I used to wear tank tops a lot.

15:24.654 --> 15:27.121
That was a big selling point.

15:29.525 --> 15:31.125
Hi, Sheldon. What's up?

15:31.127 --> 15:34.461
Good news. You're an asteroid.

15:36.899 --> 15:40.834
Uh... please tell me
what to say next.

15:40.836 --> 15:42.636
Perhaps I should explain.

15:42.638 --> 15:44.471
While working with Koothrappali,

15:44.473 --> 15:47.808
we discovered an asteroid,
and I named it after you.

15:47.810 --> 15:49.910
(laughs):
Oh.

15:49.912 --> 15:52.012
Sheldon, thank you.

15:52.014 --> 15:53.847
That's so romantic.

15:53.849 --> 15:55.416
But what about Rajesh?

15:55.418 --> 15:57.484
He was okay with
you choosing the name?

15:57.486 --> 15:59.220
Well, it took
a little negotiating,

15:59.222 --> 16:00.521
but I wore him down.

16:00.523 --> 16:02.022
Uh, we get the asteroid,

16:02.024 --> 16:03.724
and if you and I have children,

16:03.726 --> 16:07.261
they all have to be
named Rajesh.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.597
All of them?

16:09.599 --> 16:12.399
Even the girls.

16:13.202 --> 16:16.003
Okay, I think I know
what to say now.

16:18.207 --> 16:19.840
How can I not
sound like his mother

16:19.842 --> 16:21.842
when our entire bedroom
is filled with Star Wars toys?

16:21.844 --> 16:23.444
I mean, have you ever had sex

16:23.446 --> 16:26.213
with a stuffed Wookiee
watching you?

16:26.215 --> 16:29.049
I went to college in the '70s;
it was a hairier time.

16:29.051 --> 16:31.619
I'm gonna say yes.

16:31.621 --> 16:34.088
You know, if anything,
he's turning me into his mother.

16:34.090 --> 16:36.523
Before I did pharmaceutical
sales, I was an actress.

16:36.525 --> 16:38.158
You know, I was pretty good.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.694
You know, girl-next-door type,
but hot.

16:40.696 --> 16:42.930
Doable.

16:42.932 --> 16:44.198
Hmm.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.833
And not only
am I Leonard's mother,

16:45.835 --> 16:48.602
but we have this man-child
living with us named Sheldon.

16:48.604 --> 16:51.839
Oh, Leonard talked a lot
about him.

16:51.841 --> 16:54.908
I wasn't sure if he was real.

16:54.910 --> 16:57.311
Yeah, he's as real
as the fine I get

16:57.313 --> 17:00.447
when I use
too much toilet paper.

17:00.449 --> 17:04.050
Wow, you really do have
a lot on your plate.

17:04.053 --> 17:06.420
I do.

17:06.422 --> 17:07.820
You know,

17:07.823 --> 17:08.888
Leonard's right.

17:08.891 --> 17:10.758
Talking to you
is really helping.

17:10.760 --> 17:12.259
Oh, I'm glad.

17:12.261 --> 17:13.993
You know, you might also benefit

17:13.996 --> 17:16.363
from a prescription
for anxiety.

17:16.365 --> 17:18.332
Okay, if you think it'll help.

17:18.334 --> 17:19.867
Oh, just don't
make it Placinex.

17:19.868 --> 17:22.469
I do not need
sudden fits of homicidal rage.

17:26.242 --> 17:28.075
I miss you.

17:28.077 --> 17:29.710
I miss you as well.

17:29.712 --> 17:31.779
I can't believe
I miss Stuart.

17:31.781 --> 17:34.581
I guess I just miss
when life was simpler.

17:34.583 --> 17:36.450
GIRLS (chanting):
Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!

17:36.452 --> 17:37.751
Go, Leonard!
Go, Leonard!

17:37.753 --> 17:40.921
Remember, girls, you decide
what makes you happy,

17:40.923 --> 17:43.524
not your emotionally
withholding mothers.

17:43.526 --> 17:45.526
GIRLS (chanting):
Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!

17:45.528 --> 17:48.762
Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!
Go, Leonard!

18:05.225 --> 18:07.192
(whispers):
I really miss this.
