WEBVTT

00:06.600 --> 00:10.468
- And this is Sammy.

00:10.510 --> 00:13.331
He's a two-year-old squirrel
monkey from Costa Rica.
- Oh, Sammy!

00:13.380 --> 00:15.701
He's so cute! You know,
he kind of reminds me

00:15.740 --> 00:18.174
of my high school boyfriend.

00:18.210 --> 00:20.474
Can I feed him?
- Absolutely.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.341
- There you go. Oh, they
don't want your muffin.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.779
- Just like my high school
boyfriend.

00:28.490 --> 00:32.153
We will be right back with more
cute critters and Jimmy Orlando
right after this.

00:39.200 --> 00:42.237
- That was cool. Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah.

00:42.270 --> 00:45.706
Here, step down. Figured you
could miss school one morning
to hear your mom in action.

00:45.740 --> 00:50.302
- Um, about missing school,
do you remember Monica Chelsey?

00:50.350 --> 00:52.477
- I think so. Is she the girl
with the nasally voice?

00:52.520 --> 00:55.512
- She's applying for a semester
in Italy next year.

00:55.550 --> 00:59.611
What for?
- I don't know. It sounds cool.

00:59.660 --> 01:02.322
- That country is nothing but
fast cars and tight Speedos.

01:02.360 --> 01:06.251
What kind of parent would let
their 15

01:06.300 --> 01:08.359
- Oh, you made it!

01:08.400 --> 01:10.766
- You were great, Mom. 50 good.

01:10.800 --> 01:14.634
I can never tell. Ithink
that cooking segment
was a bit of a bore...

01:14.670 --> 01:17.605
Who knew
you could use dental floss
to cut a layer cake?

01:17.640 --> 01:20.234
What was that about?

01:20.280 --> 01:22.646
- Oh, the network
wants to do a segment

01:22.680 --> 01:24.648
that coincides with
National Fitness Week.

01:24.680 --> 01:28.275
That was my producer telling me
they rejected my latest idea.

01:28.320 --> 01:30.584
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

01:30.620 --> 01:33.612
- If I don't come up
with something soon
they're going to pre-empt me.

01:33.660 --> 01:35.685
Oh, but you guys
don't need to hear me whine.

01:35.720 --> 01:38.848
- Text from Angie. New client
coming into the office.

01:38.890 --> 01:41.552
- Go. I can take
Jules to school.

01:41.600 --> 01:44.524
- Yeah.
- Alright, see you soon, baby.

01:44.570 --> 01:46.538
- Bye.

01:51.410 --> 01:54.208
You were amazing. So good.
- I'm so glad you came!

02:00.520 --> 02:03.739
- Got here as quick as I could.
- This is my partner,
Matt Shade.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.815
Grace Caplan.
- Hi.

02:05.850 --> 02:08.580
- Hello._ _
- Her son IS missmg.

02:08.620 --> 02:12.351
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
When did you discover
he was gone?

02:12.400 --> 02:15.426
- I got a call from his section
commander this morning.

02:15.460 --> 02:18.827
- Oh, sorry. My son is
a private in the Army.

02:18.870 --> 02:21.634
He missed roll call. Apparently

02:21.670 --> 02:24.468
he went off base last night
and he never made it back.

02:24.510 --> 02:27.274
I have a picture
of Pete here.

02:29.910 --> 02:32.447
I know what you're thinking.

02:32.480 --> 02:35.779
He's 19; he got drunk and
ended up crashing somewhere.

02:35.820 --> 02:38.914
But my son isn't
like that. He...

02:38.950 --> 02:41.612
Well, the army is his life.

02:41.660 --> 02:43.878
And besides, he left me this.

02:43.930 --> 02:46.148
So...

02:47.530 --> 02:50.829
- shaky voice: [Hi, Mom.
I just wanted you to know...]

02:50.870 --> 02:53.930
[you may hear some things
in the next few days,
but just... just know]

02:53.970 --> 02:55.767
[that I always tried to do
the right thing. I love you.]

02:55.800 --> 02:57.961
- Please.
I know Pete.

02:58.010 --> 03:00.638
He's in trouble.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.500
You have to help me find him.

03:05.750 --> 03:09.447
- ** I see you and you see me

03:09.490 --> 03:13.551
* Watch you blowin' the lines
when you're making a scene *

03:13.590 --> 03:16.957
* Oh boy, you've got to know

03:16.990 --> 03:19.322
* What my head overlooks

03:19.360 --> 03:22.295
* The senses will show
to my heart *

03:22.330 --> 03:24.594
* When it's watching for lies

03:24.630 --> 03:27.758
* 'Cause you can't escape my

03:27.800 --> 03:29.700
* Private Eyes

03:29.740 --> 03:31.935
* They're watching you

03:31.970 --> 03:34.473
* Private Eyes

03:34.510 --> 03:36.478
* They're watching you,
watching you, watching you *

03:36.510 --> 03:40.719
* Watching you *

03:40.750 --> 03:44.413
- Asked to stay behind,

03:44.450 --> 03:46.611
said you were still pissed at
her for saying your Tinder photo

03:46.660 --> 03:49.254
looked like Ali G.
- Those were cool glasses.

03:49.290 --> 03:51.429
Look, usually when a cop
pulls a favour for a PI,

03:51.460 --> 03:53.849
he's supposed to get something
in return. Bottle of scotch,

03:53.900 --> 03:56.027
concert tickets--I can't even
get a latte out of you.

03:56.060 --> 03:59.359
- I got something for ya.
Yeah, here you go.

03:59.400 --> 04:02.506
One free smoked meat sandwich
with the purchase

04:02.540 --> 04:05.737
of a second sandwich
of equal or greater value.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.941
- You're lucky I'm hungry.

04:09.980 --> 04:12.471
Got the credit card records
on your soldier boy.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.442
You would not believe
what I had to do to get that.

04:14.480 --> 04:17.415
- Long distance.

04:17.450 --> 04:19.918
- Most recent charge

04:19.960 --> 04:22.849
was at a bar called Murphy's
in Drummond, Ontario.

04:22.890 --> 04:25.381
- That makes sense. You said
he was off base, right?
- Yeah.

04:25.430 --> 04:28.524
Spent over 400 bucks.
- Must've been some party.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.767
- Alright, thanks, buddy.
Cuban cigars next time.

04:30.800 --> 04:33.894
- Yeah, right.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.931
Hey, this is expired!

04:35.970 --> 04:39.428
- Yes, I understand that.
Alright,

04:39.480 --> 04:42.938
goodbye.
- That sounded
less than promising.

04:42.980 --> 04:45.471
- That was the public affairs
officer at the base.

04:45.510 --> 04:47.649
They won't discuss matters
under internal investigation.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.478
They wouldn't even confirm Pete
was a soldier. What do you got?

04:50.520 --> 04:53.011
- A hankering to join the army.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.709
You should see the abs
on this guy.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.751
Every photo Pete's posted

04:56.790 --> 04:58.951
since he started serving
is him on duty.

04:58.990 --> 05:01.595
He tweets so much positive army
stuff they should put him
on a billboard.

05:01.630 --> 05:04.428
- Talk about be all you can be.
- Seems weird that a guy

05:04.470 --> 05:06.597
like this would just up
and quit, don't you think?

05:06.640 --> 05:08.790
People have secrets.

05:08.840 --> 05:11.502
Who's the guy on the left?

05:11.540 --> 05:13.599
- Joe Howard. Pete and him
are pretty tight.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.904
And also another soldier,
Tom Wallace.

05:15.940 --> 05:18.579
I call them The Three Amigos.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.749
Or "Ab-migos".

05:20.780 --> 05:22.316
You know, 'cause...

05:23.720 --> 05:26.382
Alright, I'm still working
on the nicknames.

05:26.420 --> 05:29.116
- Can you send me a picture
of those three? Shirts on.

05:29.160 --> 05:32.698
Oh. Hey, how's it going?

05:32.730 --> 05:35.893
- Just finished up with Mazhari.
Looks like our buddy Pete

05:35.930 --> 05:37.898
[dropped 400 and change at a bar
in Drummond last night.]

05:37.930 --> 05:39.864
- Well, let's get up there
and check it out.

05:39.900 --> 05:43.506
- Fine. But I choose
the podcast this time.

05:43.540 --> 05:46.008
- OK...

05:46.040 --> 05:48.531
- Fancy meeting you here,
soldier.

05:48.580 --> 05:51.469
- Interesting choice of words.
What're you doing here?

05:51.510 --> 05:54.741
- Well, I got caught trying
to knock off a liquor store.

05:54.780 --> 05:56.714
They're trying to clear out
some holding cells and I need

05:56.750 --> 05:58.718
to review some paperwork.
It's really boring.

05:58.750 --> 06:01.810
- It's not boring at all.
The suit would look good--

06:01.860 --> 06:05.159
- No, no, not here. I'm supposed
to be an authority figure.

06:05.190 --> 06:07.727
- And I'm supposed to be a good
boy, but that never stopped me.
- Well, we will continue

06:07.760 --> 06:10.399
this conversation _
over dinner on FrIday nIght.

06:10.430 --> 06:12.830
Friday, I can't.

06:12.870 --> 06:15.430
It's a Jules night for me now.
Becca switched on me
last minute.

06:15.470 --> 06:18.064
- Ah, the mysterious daughter.

06:18.110 --> 06:21.034
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm late. I should go.

06:26.650 --> 06:28.948
- Then she gives me this look

06:28.980 --> 06:31.141
like Ijust clubbed a baby seal.

06:31.190 --> 06:33.556
I mean, you'd think
she'd be happy to be with a guy

06:33.590 --> 06:35.785
who wants to spend time
with his daughter. Am I wrong?

06:35.820 --> 06:38.152
- How long have you two
been dating?
- Two months.

06:38.190 --> 06:41.591
- Uh-huh...

06:41.630 --> 06:43.894
- Two months is like an eternity
in today's day and age.

06:43.930 --> 06:46.467
She's probably just wondering
where it's going.

06:46.500 --> 06:49.196
- It's going down the normal
path of a relationship,
that's where it's going.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.435
- Have you met
any of her family?

06:51.470 --> 06:54.075
- Uh... yeah, her brother.

06:54.110 --> 06:56.601
Her mother. Oh, and
her great-aunt Louella.

06:57.810 --> 07:00.745
Oh, you think she's upset

07:00.780 --> 07:02.748
because I haven't
introduced her to Jules?

07:02.790 --> 07:05.679
- That's exactly
why she's upset.
- She said she was fine

07:05.720 --> 07:08.553
not meeting Jules. Besides,
I don't think Jules is ready

07:08.590 --> 07:10.126
for it yet.

07:12.090 --> 07:14.752
- Go ahead and get it. I'm very
good at not listening.

07:14.800 --> 07:17.621
- Oh, I know that about you.

07:17.670 --> 07:20.093
It's fine.
I'll call him later.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.859
- Haven't seen the good doctor
in a while. Did one of you
pull the plug?

07:22.910 --> 07:25.060
- No, it's
all good. He's been

07:25.110 --> 07:29.137
at a conference all week.
About what?
- Um, doctor...

07:29.180 --> 07:32.911
medical devices.

07:32.950 --> 07:36.613
Just keep your eyes
on the road, please.

07:36.650 --> 07:39.483
***

07:55.070 --> 07:58.198
- Ah, this is my kind of bar.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.935
A place where everybody
knows your name.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.073
Hey.

08:02.110 --> 08:04.544
- Yeah, Matt Shade.

08:04.580 --> 08:06.172
Former hockey player?

08:07.680 --> 08:10.717
I'll take two bottles of beer.

08:10.750 --> 08:13.184
Whatever's popular.

08:13.220 --> 08:16.212
- Smooth.
- Thanks.

08:16.260 --> 08:18.125
Holy crap!

08:20.830 --> 08:22.661
How you doing?
Good, man.

08:22.700 --> 08:24.725
- We're looking for a guy
who was here last night,

08:24.770 --> 08:27.034
Private Pete Caplan.

08:27.070 --> 08:29.538
- Oh yeah, sure. He was here.

08:29.570 --> 08:32.300
With a couple of his buddies.

08:32.340 --> 08:34.706
- Yeah. You guys were playing
pool with them, right?

08:34.740 --> 08:38.244
- We might have taken
a couple of games from 'em.
What's this about?

08:38.280 --> 08:40.840
- I owe Pete some money
from some memorabilia

08:40.880 --> 08:43.713
he sold me a couple years ago.
Did he say where he was going?

08:43.750 --> 08:46.810
- I assume back to the base.
- We checked, he didn't make it.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.749
- That's weird.
- Did you guys talk
to them at all?

08:49.790 --> 08:52.554
- Oh, they were pretty trashed
by the time they got to us.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.556
I think they were
celebrating something.

08:54.600 --> 08:58.593
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Here,
these are for you guys.

08:58.630 --> 09:02.634
Enjoy.
- Hey man, cheers.
- Yep.

09:04.970 --> 09:07.609
- I don't know. Seems
like a normal night out

09:07.640 --> 09:10.108
with your buddies.
- Those guys at the bar
said they were living it up.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.573
Maybe Pete was throwing himself
a farewell party.

09:12.620 --> 09:15.339
Do what?

09:15.380 --> 09:17.780
I couldn't help but overhear.

09:17.820 --> 09:20.254
Those soldiers you were
asking about? I don't think
they were celebrating.

09:20.290 --> 09:23.123
- I was there when they paid
the bill. The first two guys

09:23.160 --> 09:25.685
wanted to pay cash,
but the third guy insisted
on using his credit card.

09:25.730 --> 09:27.721
It got pretty heated.
- Like they were arguing

09:27.760 --> 09:29.899
over who was gonna pay?
That's a first.

09:29.930 --> 09:32.125
- They came out here and started
shoving each other. I saw 'em
through the window.

09:32.170 --> 09:34.934
- Did you happen
to see them leave?
- Yeah, the first two guys

09:34.970 --> 09:37.006
got in a cab and drove off.
They left the third guy
standing there.

09:37.040 --> 09:39.873
- Yeah.

09:39.910 --> 09:43.368
He started walking back towards
the base. Last time I saw him.
- Huh. Thanks.

09:43.410 --> 09:45.844
- OK.

09:45.880 --> 09:48.269
- The last two people to see
Pete were Tom and Joe,

09:48.320 --> 09:51.084
right after they got
into an argument with him.
- We need to talk to them.

09:51.120 --> 09:54.385
We can't just walk
onto a military base and
start interrogating them.

09:54.420 --> 09:56.957
- I may know a way.

09:56.990 --> 09:58.924
But I'm really
wishing I didn't.

10:04.430 --> 10:06.227
***

10:14.810 --> 10:17.005
- This is so exciting!

10:17.050 --> 10:19.939
The network loved
your idea, Shadow.

10:19.980 --> 10:22.744
They said it's the best way to
celebrate National Fitness Week.

10:22.790 --> 10:25.315
- That's great, Becca.

10:29.020 --> 10:31.181
- Welcome to Drummond.

10:33.160 --> 10:35.253
You're in the army now, soldier.

10:45.140 --> 10:47.700
- I'm not sure how you pulled
this off, Ms. D'Orsay.

10:47.740 --> 10:50.140
- Well, it turns out
the head of my network

10:50.180 --> 10:52.671
is friends with
General Parker,

10:52.720 --> 10:54.745
so we pitched him on a piece
for National Fitness Week--

10:54.780 --> 10:56.987
"Can former hockey star
Matt Shade

10:57.020 --> 10:59.682
take on the Army's best?"

10:59.720 --> 11:01.984
He loved it.
- Well, I've been ordered

11:02.020 --> 11:04.159
to offer you
my full cooperation,

11:04.190 --> 11:07.227
but that_doesn't mean
I like crvrllans traIpsmg
around my base.

11:07.260 --> 11:09.228
We have rules here.

11:09.260 --> 11:11.694
Number one: Respect
the command structure.

11:11.730 --> 11:14.369
Number two: Stay out
of restricted areas.
And number three--

11:17.910 --> 11:20.037
Well, looks like this might be
enjoyable after all.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.401
Corporal Craig will
help you get set up.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.408
You'll be embedded
with Kilo company.

11:24.450 --> 11:27.078
- Kilo company. That's
your most elite unit, right?

11:27.120 --> 11:29.338
Private Joe Howard,
Tom Wallace, Pete Caplan?

11:29.380 --> 11:32.315
- All part of being
a good assistant.

11:36.320 --> 11:39.289
- Right this way.

11:39.330 --> 11:42.356
- Fire four! Fire five!

11:44.070 --> 11:45.890
Cease fire!

11:45.930 --> 11:49.161
Fall in!

11:49.200 --> 11:52.169
- Sergeant,
this is Matt Shade,

11:52.210 --> 11:55.429
Becca D'Orsay, and...
- Angie Everett.

11:55.480 --> 11:59.371
- Angie Everett.
- Well, well, well.
We have a celebrity among us.

11:59.410 --> 12:01.344
The "Shadow" was a bit of a pest
back in his playing days.

12:01.380 --> 12:05.419
He worked his tail off
on the ice. I admired that.

12:05.450 --> 12:08.157
But that was then
and this is now.

12:08.190 --> 12:11.079
I'm the pest here and...

12:11.130 --> 12:15.226
this is my arena. Am I right?
: Yes, sergeant!
- We're gonna show him

12:15.260 --> 12:18.127
that we are no after-supper
soldiers. We're no dirtsucking

12:18.170 --> 12:20.866
ground pounders. We are
Four section Kilo company,

12:20.900 --> 12:23.232
the most elite infantry unit

12:23.270 --> 12:26.159
in this entire goddamn army!
Is that clear?

12:26.210 --> 12:28.906
: Yes, sergeant!
- Thanks, guys.

12:28.940 --> 12:31.943
Looking forward to--
- You don't talk when
I talk, sweetheart.

12:35.280 --> 12:37.248
Get down and assume
a push-up pOSItlon.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.485
Go, 25.

12:39.520 --> 12:41.750
Beeee-gin!

12:43.490 --> 12:46.857
Now, this
is Becca D'Orsay.

12:46.900 --> 12:50.028
I'm a big fan of her show,
and from this moment on,
you are too.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.163
You will cooperate with her
and her assistant here

12:52.200 --> 12:54.930
and answer any and
all of her questions.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.299
- Get those Cadillacs in gear.
All of you.

12:59.340 --> 13:01.103
Run!

13:04.380 --> 13:06.473
Run!

13:16.260 --> 13:20.196
- _Just relax. _We'll_ start
wrth something Simple.
Tell me your name.

13:20.230 --> 13:22.357
- Private Jessie Page,
X-ray-five-three,

13:22.400 --> 13:24.493
three-four-niner,
niner-zero-one.

13:24.530 --> 13:26.896
- What do you like most
about being a soldier?

13:26.940 --> 13:30.000
- The chance to be with everyone
here. They're like my family.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.008
- Do you ever fight
with each other?
- I mean,

13:32.040 --> 13:35.134
there's the odd disagreement.
- You know.

13:35.180 --> 13:39.071
Stupid stuff. People
stealing each other's gear,
dogging it in training.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.078
There was a big disagreement
a few days ago,

13:41.120 --> 13:43.588
after the mapping compass
training exercise.

13:43.620 --> 13:46.214
- Tell me about that.
- It was a standard
field exercise.

13:46.250 --> 13:47.808
The entire company
was sent into the woods

13:47.860 --> 13:50.852
about an hour north of here.
Each group had a different
mission to accomplish.

13:50.890 --> 13:54.519
- Joe Howard. And, uh,
Pete Caplan.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.892
- Pete Caplan. I heard he holds
all the base records.

13:56.930 --> 13:59.125
- Yeah. Pete's the king.

13:59.170 --> 14:01.638
- I think he's sick.

14:01.670 --> 14:03.968
- The three of you are pretty
legendary around here.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.160
The three amigos.

14:06.210 --> 14:09.407
- We've had a good run.
- Except the other guys said
in this latest exercise

14:09.440 --> 14:13.513
your team was the last
to check in. Two hours late.
- Angle...

14:13.550 --> 14:17.213
- All good things come to
an end. Like this interview.

14:19.420 --> 14:21.559
- Nice.

14:21.590 --> 14:25.287
You know I actually have
to compile a segment
from this, right?

14:25.330 --> 14:28.049
Oh, Angie-poo, would you mind

14:28.100 --> 14:30.921
grabbing me a sparkling soda
from the vending machine?

14:30.970 --> 14:33.894
- Oh, come on.
- Chop chop.

14:37.970 --> 14:40.438
You got all that, right?

14:44.010 --> 14:47.343
- God, you're an angel.
That guy's the devil.

14:49.550 --> 14:52.439
Who thought this "National
Fitness Week" story
was a good idea?

14:52.490 --> 14:55.288
It's like I'm eleven years old
again and Coach Kroll

14:55.320 --> 14:58.289
won't let us off the ice
until one of us soils himself.

14:58.330 --> 15:01.299
- You had a complicated
childhood.

15:01.330 --> 15:04.493
I talked to Tom and Joe. Three
days ago there was this--

15:04.530 --> 15:06.623
- Mapping compass training
exercise. Yeah,

15:06.670 --> 15:08.433
everyone's talking about it.
You think something happened?

15:08.470 --> 15:11.701
- They were two hours late.
The problem is we have no way of
knowing what slowed them down.

15:11.740 --> 15:14.937
- Maybe we do have a way.
The guys said that each team

15:14.980 --> 15:17.403
was given a handheld GPS so they
could find their checkpoints.

15:17.450 --> 15:20.044
- So maybe they were tracked,
even logged, during
their exercise.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.071
- Does that mean we get
to go home now?
- Not yet.

15:22.120 --> 15:26.341
- Hey, winlq-dink! Enough
with the jibber jabber!

15:26.390 --> 15:29.587
- I swear to God,
I can only make out about
half of what that guy says.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.732
- Oh!

15:43.770 --> 15:45.658
- At ease, corporal.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.602
Are the interviews
gomg alright?

15:49.640 --> 15:52.108
- Yes, um, but a couple
of the guys

15:52.150 --> 15:54.311
have been mentioning
GPS units.

15:54.350 --> 15:57.046
- Standard issue for
extended field exercises.

15:57.090 --> 16:00.218
- Right. Unfortunately
our audience won't understand

16:00.260 --> 16:03.286
what that is, so I was hoping
that you could walk me
through it?

16:03.330 --> 16:06.185
For example, the last compass
training exercise?

16:06.230 --> 16:10.360
- Sure. Uh, that would be...
this one here.

16:10.400 --> 16:13.563
See, each three-person team

16:13.600 --> 16:17.229
had a GPS unit that logged
their movements.

16:17.270 --> 16:20.137
- So you map their coordinates
over time

16:20.180 --> 16:22.478
and then you know exactly
where they were at what time.

16:22.510 --> 16:24.501
Not so tough.

16:24.550 --> 16:26.609
- You've been
so helpful.

16:26.650 --> 16:29.312
Can I ask you one more favour?
My boss, Becca,

16:29.350 --> 16:32.547
is desperate for a sparkling
water. Is there any chance
you could rustle one up?

16:32.590 --> 16:36.549
- We call it "officer water".
I'll see what I can do.

16:36.590 --> 16:40.390
- Thank you.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.368
- Oh...

16:48.400 --> 16:50.766
I have new respect for
our troops, that's for sure.

16:50.810 --> 16:54.735
- We got a lot of great stuff
today, Matt. Thank you.

16:54.780 --> 16:57.749
I hope you find that boy.
- Yeah, me too.

16:57.780 --> 17:01.341
I don't know what I'd do
if Jules ever went missing.

17:01.380 --> 17:04.508
- Oh, she'll be fine on her own.
It's only a semester.

17:07.720 --> 17:11.053
- Her trip to Italy next year.

17:11.090 --> 17:12.785
I thought she was going to.

17:12.830 --> 17:15.196
- She's fifteen!

17:15.230 --> 17:17.460
Do you honestly think it's a
good idea to send her to Italy?

17:17.500 --> 17:20.469
- Look what going abroad did
for me. I'm a whole new person.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.730
- She doesn't need
to become a new person!
She's great the way she is!

17:22.770 --> 17:25.136
- OK, you're tired

17:25.170 --> 17:27.138
and your ego's
taken a beating.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.637
Let's pick this up
tomorrow.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.511
Let's go.

17:41.260 --> 17:43.478
- I was able

17:43.530 --> 17:45.623
to pick out coordinates
from the photos you took.

17:45.660 --> 17:48.549
Pete's group was assigned to go
here to complete their mission:

17:48.600 --> 17:51.262
collect a code from an ammo can
tied to a tree.

17:51.300 --> 17:54.463
But somehow they
went off course

17:54.500 --> 17:56.661
and stopped... here
for close to two hours.

17:56.700 --> 18:00.170
- Nothing. Just woods.

18:00.210 --> 18:01.871
- So why spend
two hours there?

18:01.910 --> 18:05.676
- Whatever broke up the Three
Amigos happened on that trip.

18:05.710 --> 18:08.747
- Which means the key
to finding Pete is
somewhere in those woods.

18:17.830 --> 18:21.425
- Hey, Mrs. Caplan. Yeah,
we'll be in touch as soon
as we know anything. OK.

18:21.460 --> 18:23.428
- Hey. What's this,

18:23.470 --> 18:25.791
you're auditioning
for "Ice Road Truckers"?

18:25.830 --> 18:29.163
- Angie and I are heading out
for the woods, see if we find
clues about that missing kid.

18:29.200 --> 18:32.909
Speaking of kids...
- Yeah. Tread carefully.

18:32.940 --> 18:35.238
You're not her favourite
person right now.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.909
- Hey Jules, can I talk
to you about something?

18:42.950 --> 18:46.340
No need.
Mom already told me
you don't want me to go.

18:46.390 --> 18:48.358
- It's not that I don't
want you to go, honey.

18:48.390 --> 18:50.358
I just don't think you should
go right now.

18:50.390 --> 18:52.324
What's the worst
that could happen?
- Two words:

18:52.360 --> 18:54.453
Amanda Knox.
- Dad, seriously.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.798
- Yes, seriously. You're
barely fifteen years old.

18:56.830 --> 19:00.664
- Yes, and all my friends
applied. Rita's sister
is going, she's fourteen!

19:00.700 --> 19:02.395
- This isn't about anybody else,
honey. This is about you.

19:02.440 --> 19:05.432
Traveling to a foreign
country is a big deal,

19:05.470 --> 19:07.404
and I just don't think you're
ready, especially since--

19:07.440 --> 19:10.307
What, because I'm blind?

19:10.350 --> 19:13.319
- Honey, take it easy.
- That's not what I meant.

19:14.950 --> 19:16.941
- Grandpa, can you give me
a ride to school? Apparently

19:16.980 --> 19:19.187
I'm too disabled
to get myself around.

19:21.690 --> 19:23.351
- Jules, hang on!

19:29.530 --> 19:33.534
- Hey Zoe, have you seen
my... phone?

19:33.570 --> 19:37.267
- Warning texts only work
when you keep it on you, boss.

19:40.710 --> 19:43.508
Grab supplies? Take up
Tae Kwon Do? All of the above.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.516
- I'm good.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.523
Look, Angie, about
the other night--

19:57.560 --> 19:59.949
That's salt.
- Oh. Yeah, I know.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.925
It's a new thing. Like the
butter fad from a few years ago.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.497
- Put butter in your coffee.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.837
- Look, Angie, I know you found

20:10.870 --> 20:13.873
your old engagement ring
at my place, but it's
not what you think.

20:13.910 --> 20:16.799
- The truth is, I didn't
know what to think.

20:16.840 --> 20:21.812
- I dug it up the first night
that I saw you. I guess I was
feeling a little nostalgic,

20:21.850 --> 20:25.980
but that's it. I wasn't gonna
propose to you or anything.
That'd be ridiculous.

20:26.020 --> 20:28.750
- OK.

20:28.790 --> 20:32.453
- Look, I'm not here
to put pressure on you.

20:32.490 --> 20:34.594
Ijust...

20:34.630 --> 20:37.667
I thought things were going well
and I don't want to lose you

20:37.700 --> 20:39.998
over some stupid
misunderstanding.

20:43.310 --> 20:46.336
- Hey Ken, how was
the medical conference?

20:48.580 --> 20:50.878
- Illuminating.

20:55.450 --> 20:57.384
- Let's go. We have
a long drive.

21:05.490 --> 21:08.391
- So there I was, telling her
she shouldn't go, and blaming it

21:08.430 --> 21:10.523
on the fact that she's blind.
- Oh, you didn't!

21:10.570 --> 21:12.561
- I did. It just came out.

21:12.600 --> 21:15.296
The one thing I swore
I'd never do.
- OK, well,

21:15.340 --> 21:18.730
everyone gets one slip-up.
- I can't help it.

21:18.770 --> 21:21.534
I'm worried. Italy might as well
be on the moon.

21:21.580 --> 21:25.471
How can I protect her
if she's 4,000 miles away?

21:25.510 --> 21:29.879
- Only if it's 100%
in agreement with me.

21:29.920 --> 21:34.311
- You're not afraid she'll get
lost in Italy. You're afraid
you'll lose her to Italy.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.487
I mean, it's a big step,
letting her go off on her own.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.488
Maybe she handles it well.

21:38.530 --> 21:40.498
Maybe she handles it so well

21:40.530 --> 21:42.691
that she wants more.

21:42.730 --> 21:45.699
It's called growing up.
- I don't think I'm ready
for that.

21:45.730 --> 21:48.699
If you
love something, set it free.

21:48.740 --> 21:51.766
- Whoever said that
didn't have kids.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.759
- Well, this is where

22:11.790 --> 22:14.452
they started
the mapping exercise.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.469
From here on in, we're
following the coordinates.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.468
Two hours in,
two hours out.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.468
- Alright, let's hit it.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.968
Wait, you hear that?

22:24.010 --> 22:27.537
- I don't hear anything.
- Yeah, exactly.

22:27.580 --> 22:29.901
No traffic, no pedestrians
yelling, nothing.

22:29.940 --> 22:31.908
Just you and me.

22:31.950 --> 22:35.010
- That's incredibly creepy.

22:35.050 --> 22:37.814
Come on. The path
is through here.

23:03.510 --> 23:06.149
***

23:17.120 --> 23:20.749
- Huh. Is there supposed
to be a road here?

23:20.800 --> 23:23.462
- It's not on the map,
but this is the spot.

23:23.500 --> 23:26.162
The last recorded
coordinate on the GPS.

23:26.200 --> 23:29.829
- There's nothing here.
What would keep 'em here
for two hours?

23:34.210 --> 23:37.202
Went for a ride and
shut off the GPS.

23:37.240 --> 23:38.673
Or maybe it malfunctioned.

23:40.210 --> 23:43.646
Or maybe they just left it here
and went somewhere else.

23:43.690 --> 23:46.409
- Whoa!
- I guess we head back
the way we came...

23:48.990 --> 23:50.651
...see if we missed something.

23:52.130 --> 23:55.099
Shade!

23:55.130 --> 23:58.793
Oh my God! Don't move,
I'm coming down!
- Not moving.

24:06.910 --> 24:09.731
- I've been better.

24:09.780 --> 24:13.170
- Oh my God! I turn my back for
one second! How did this happen?

24:13.210 --> 24:16.145
- Making you a donut bandage.
To keep it from moving.

24:16.180 --> 24:17.943
I'm not
leaving this thing in there!

24:17.990 --> 24:21.756
- No, wait, don't--
- Argh!!

24:21.790 --> 24:24.725
- Or you could do that.
- So much better.

24:24.760 --> 24:27.024
- You're gonna need
a dressing on that.

24:27.060 --> 24:29.551
OK, we need to get you
back to the car.

24:29.600 --> 24:32.194
Can you walk?

24:32.230 --> 24:34.869
- Not for two hours.

24:34.900 --> 24:38.063
Angie.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.704
- Don't pretend to be all manly
and say that you're fine.

24:40.740 --> 24:44.005
- No, look.

24:51.890 --> 24:54.211
Looks like it's been here
for years.
- Yeah.

25:08.700 --> 25:11.908
- What do you think
happened to this guy?

25:11.940 --> 25:14.579
- Nothing good.

25:16.810 --> 25:19.199
Whoa...

25:21.620 --> 25:24.839
- Exploding dye pack.

25:26.350 --> 25:29.888
I think I know why our Three
Amigos went off the grid.

25:45.370 --> 25:47.736
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Shut the door!

25:47.780 --> 25:50.078
- Oh yeah, 'cause it's
way warmer in here.

25:50.110 --> 25:52.169
I couldn't get a signal.
This whole area

25:52.210 --> 25:55.043
is a dead zone.

25:55.080 --> 25:56.911
What'd you find?

25:56.950 --> 25:59.783
- "Simcoe County Savings Bank."
This van was obviously used

25:59.820 --> 26:01.788
as a getaway vehicle
for a bank robbery.

26:01.820 --> 26:05.688
- Simcoe... I remember that.

26:05.730 --> 26:08.699
It was like twenty years ago.
My dad used to talk about it.

26:08.730 --> 26:12.222
Two gunmen went into the Simcoe
County Savings Bank in Drummond.

26:12.270 --> 26:15.159
One of them got shot by the
police and the other one made
off with millions of dollars.

26:15.200 --> 26:19.034
- Let me guess:
he was never seen again.
- It became a local legend.

26:19.070 --> 26:21.106
I think they even made
a documentary about it.

26:21.140 --> 26:23.745
- Huh. So when
the dye pack went off,

26:23.780 --> 26:26.305
the driver lost control of
the van and went off the road.

26:26.350 --> 26:29.114
- The money's just been
sitting here ever since.
- Until Pete and his buddies

26:29.150 --> 26:32.142
showed up. We were at the right
place, just the wrong elevation.

26:32.190 --> 26:34.658
My guess is they took
the usable bills

26:34.690 --> 26:37.056
and stashed them
somewhere nearby.
- Which explains why

26:37.090 --> 26:39.126
they were two hours late.
- And why they were suddenly
at each other's throats.

26:39.160 --> 26:41.799
But then where's Pete?
- Well,

26:41.830 --> 26:43.821
a few millions dollars is a
pretty good motive for murder.

26:43.870 --> 26:45.690
- Now if we could just
tell someone.

26:45.730 --> 26:47.994
- We'll never make it
to the car in the dark

26:48.040 --> 26:50.338
with your leg. We'll just have

26:50.370 --> 26:54.170
In the morning I'll follow the
road until I get a signal.
- OK.

26:54.210 --> 26:56.929
- We'll be fine.
- Yeah, we'll be fine.

27:03.180 --> 27:06.980
Angie?

27:07.020 --> 27:11.184
- He's not back yet.

27:11.230 --> 27:14.825
- He texted me to say
he wanted to talk tonight.
I canceled plans.

27:14.860 --> 27:17.829
- No, I've left three messages.

27:20.070 --> 27:22.334
- Yeah, thanks.

27:22.370 --> 27:25.009
- Voicemail.

27:25.040 --> 27:27.873
Weird.

27:27.910 --> 27:30.708
***

27:30.750 --> 27:32.968
- Ah... there you go!

27:33.010 --> 27:35.069
How's that, better?

27:35.120 --> 27:37.270
Much better.
I was freezing.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.413
- Now all we need is some food.

27:39.450 --> 27:41.418
- You wouldn't happen to have a
rotisserie chicken in that bag

27:41.460 --> 27:43.314
of yours, would you?
- I told you not to eat

27:43.360 --> 27:45.328
all the trail mix.
- Couldn't help it, it was

27:45.360 --> 27:47.692
the M&Ms!

27:47.730 --> 27:49.755
Ah, it's just one night.
We're gonna be fine, Everett.

27:57.200 --> 27:59.361
- ** Winter

27:59.410 --> 28:01.037
YouTe
gonna waste the battery!

28:01.080 --> 28:03.230
- No, I got
plenty of charge.

28:03.280 --> 28:09.970
_ - * Please _cover
With your whiteness *

28:10.020 --> 28:13.012
- I love this song.
- Yeah.

28:13.050 --> 28:16.156
- Though I never would have
pegged you for a jazz man.

28:16.190 --> 28:18.181
- I keep telling you, I'm
more than just a pretty face.

28:18.230 --> 28:21.393
- * There was

28:21.430 --> 28:24.797
- Oh! It...

28:24.830 --> 28:27.196
just reminded me
of something.

28:27.230 --> 28:29.437
- * Ooh-ooh
- We got all night!

28:29.470 --> 28:32.860
- My first date with Ken,

28:32.910 --> 28:36.038
we went to listen to a jazz
singer. Can't remember her name.

28:36.080 --> 28:38.401
All I remember is
that he really hated it.

28:38.450 --> 28:41.476
- Hm!

28:41.520 --> 28:44.842
- Ken wasn't at a medical
conference, was he?

28:44.890 --> 28:48.087
- * Winter snow

28:48.120 --> 28:50.350
- The other night... I was
looking through a drawer

28:50.390 --> 28:52.483
at his place,
and I found

28:52.530 --> 28:54.452
my old engagement ring.

28:54.500 --> 28:57.424
- Yeah.

28:57.460 --> 29:00.361
According to him,
it was there by accident.

29:00.400 --> 29:03.437
- Some accident!

29:03.470 --> 29:06.303
- It sounded true
when he said it.

29:06.340 --> 29:09.434
- So... what
are you gonna do?

29:09.480 --> 29:12.369
***

29:12.410 --> 29:15.072
- I don't know.

29:15.120 --> 29:18.385
The last time I was
with Ken, I ran out on him.

29:18.420 --> 29:21.810
I can't do that
this time, you know?

29:21.860 --> 29:23.828
I have to be sure.

29:23.860 --> 29:25.521
(The music has stopped.
We hear the fire crackling.)

29:38.070 --> 29:40.265
Really?

29:40.310 --> 29:43.871
- It's Don. He and Jules
are obsessed with K-Pop

29:43.910 --> 29:46.344
and he keeps putting it on my
phone 'cause he doesn't know how

29:46.380 --> 29:48.940
to connect his with
the Bluetooth speakers.

29:48.980 --> 29:52.347
Aanay. . .

29:52.390 --> 29:55.154
Look, I can understand

29:55.190 --> 29:57.385
you wanting to be
sure about Ken, but...

29:57.420 --> 29:59.422
you don't have to be
sure about him right now.

29:59.460 --> 30:01.451
If he makes you
happy, who cares?

30:01.500 --> 30:04.094
- Yeah!

30:08.500 --> 30:11.230
- Well, do you plan on
introducing Me! to Jules

30:11.270 --> 30:13.830
sometime in this century?
- Ugh...

30:13.880 --> 30:16.075
I don't know.

30:16.110 --> 30:18.374
I was hardly there when
Jules was growing up, and...

30:18.410 --> 30:20.571
I don't know, it seems
that we're just finally

30:20.610 --> 30:23.511
in a good rhythm, and...
if I add somebody else

30:23.550 --> 30:26.417
to the mix, it might
dilute it somehow.

30:26.450 --> 30:29.453
- Yeah, but then, you'd get
to spend more time with her.

30:29.490 --> 30:32.857
You wouldn't have to divide
your time between her and Mel.

30:32.890 --> 30:34.596
Plus you might find

30:34.630 --> 30:37.497
that adding someone to your
lives makes it... even better.

30:39.930 --> 30:43.559
- And you might be right.

30:43.600 --> 30:48.628
***

30:48.680 --> 30:51.843
- We should get some sleep.
- Yeah.

30:55.020 --> 30:57.545
- Goodnight, Shade.

30:57.580 --> 30:59.309
- Good night, Everett.

31:01.460 --> 31:04.384
***

31:16.600 --> 31:19.160
- No, I know my dad,
he would have called if he was

31:19.210 --> 31:21.007
gonna be away this long.
- Well, maybe his phone died.

31:21.040 --> 31:23.577
Her car
wasn't there,

31:23.610 --> 31:25.908
I knocked on her apartment
door this morning

31:25.950 --> 31:27.918
and there was no answer.
- What were they domg

31:27.950 --> 31:30.145
on a wilderness hike
in the first place?

31:30.180 --> 31:32.978
- It was for the missing kid
case. They were following a map

31:33.020 --> 31:35.011
through the woods.
- OK, I will contact

31:35.060 --> 31:37.415
the Feds, and get them
to keep a lookout for the car.

31:37.460 --> 31:39.951
- No, that's not good enough.
You need to call the Army base.

31:39.990 --> 31:42.629
- Tell them to send
someone out looking for them.

31:42.660 --> 31:44.969
What are you, Napoleon?

31:45.000 --> 31:47.298
I can't just tell the Army
what to do. You know, besides,

31:47.330 --> 31:49.935
I have a job already that
does not include babysitting

31:49.970 --> 31:52.200
two grown adults who, I mean,
if we're being honest here,

31:52.240 --> 31:54.401
have a real proclivity
for getting in trouble.

31:54.440 --> 31:56.601
- But they could be in danger!
They could have gotten

31:56.640 --> 31:59.404
lost in the woods or injured
or attacked by an animal.

31:59.450 --> 32:01.315
- Maybe they got adopted by
wolves, you don't know.

32:01.350 --> 32:03.716
They could be very happy.

32:06.720 --> 32:08.551
- What do you mean,
about the wolves?

32:08.590 --> 32:11.229
- Did you just make fun
of me for being blind?

32:11.260 --> 32:13.080
Hey! No! What
are you talking about?

32:13.130 --> 32:14.995
- I cannot believe that
an officer of the law

32:15.030 --> 32:17.225
has this kind of prejudice.
I have rights, you know!

32:17.260 --> 32:19.228
- OK, this is just a joke.
We're kidding around.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.693
Could you stop it, please?!

32:24.740 --> 32:28.176
- This is my dad we're
talking about. Make the call.

32:28.210 --> 32:31.407
- OK. Just... please,
don't do that again.

32:55.270 --> 32:58.660
- Sorry.
- Hm... No, it's OK.

33:02.480 --> 33:06.405
: Still hurts but...
I think the bleeding stopped.

33:06.450 --> 33:09.374
- OK. Sit tight, I'm gonna
head up to the road,

33:09.420 --> 33:11.638
get some help.

33:11.690 --> 33:15.456
- Sh... someone's coming.

33:15.490 --> 33:18.459
- You better not be
riding me, kid! It's cold

33:18.490 --> 33:21.027
out_here and I'm
losmg patience.

33:24.200 --> 33:27.294
- It's Pete! He's alive!

33:27.330 --> 33:30.458
It's those guys from the bar.
- And they have guns.

33:35.640 --> 33:37.779
***
- We gotta get outta here.

33:42.120 --> 33:44.441
I can't outrun those guys.

33:44.490 --> 33:46.082
- We just have to hide...
- We're not going to make it.

33:46.120 --> 33:48.259
No!
- You need to leave me.

33:48.290 --> 33:50.349
Go, get in cell range to get
help. You know I'm right.

33:50.390 --> 33:52.278
Go.
- I'll be back.

33:52.330 --> 33:55.822
- OK, I know you will.

33:55.860 --> 33:58.090
***

34:15.380 --> 34:17.712
-_ Sounds like it's
coming from over there.

34:17.750 --> 34:20.412
***

34:24.190 --> 34:27.318
- There it is.
I can't believe it.

34:27.360 --> 34:31.057
- Watch him.

34:39.870 --> 34:42.202
Where's the money?

34:42.240 --> 34:45.175
- I told you, I don't know.
Joe and Tom hid it.

34:45.210 --> 34:47.098
- Stop messing with us, kid.
You know that we've got

34:47.150 --> 34:49.618
your mother's address.
- Shut up.

34:49.650 --> 34:53.848
Someone was here. Recently.

34:53.890 --> 34:57.678
- Whoever you are...
show yourself!

35:03.660 --> 35:07.096
Check it out.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.909
Must be injured.

35:11.940 --> 35:13.532
Go.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.372
***

35:48.680 --> 35:51.843
- LET HIM GO!!

35:51.880 --> 35:54.917
Let him go,
or he dies.

36:02.220 --> 36:05.951
- Shadow! Shoulda
stuck to hockey.

36:05.990 --> 36:08.550
Get on your knees.

36:12.430 --> 36:14.694
- You heard them talking in the
bar about the money they found.

36:14.740 --> 36:17.595
- Shut up.
- And you grabbed
Pete on the road, didn't you?

36:17.640 --> 36:19.528
- You always had
a mouth on you.

36:19.570 --> 36:22.300
- We got no choice.

36:22.340 --> 36:25.605
He knows who we are.
- Whoa. We didn't

36:25.650 --> 36:27.948
talk about killing anybody.
- What did you think

36:27.980 --> 36:31.245
was gonna h
a
- Stop! ppen?

36:31.290 --> 36:33.246
Think about this.

36:33.290 --> 36:35.758
***

36:35.790 --> 36:38.224
- Drop it.

36:38.260 --> 36:41.889
- Angie...
- I got this, Shade.

36:41.930 --> 36:43.795
- Shoot her, Des!
- I don't know, Gord.

36:43.830 --> 36:46.526
- She's not gonna shoot us.

36:46.570 --> 36:49.596
You're not gonna shoot
us, are you, Princess?

36:49.640 --> 36:51.403
- No, she's not!
But I will!

36:54.880 --> 36:56.700
- This way!
- Come on,

36:56.740 --> 36:58.571
hurry up! Hurry up!
- Drop the weapon!

36:58.610 --> 37:00.805
Do it now!
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

37:06.490 --> 37:09.516
- It's OK, buddy. I got you.

37:32.850 --> 37:34.579
- You found this during
the field exercise?

37:34.620 --> 37:36.975
- Yes ma'am.
- But you didn't report it

37:37.020 --> 37:39.545
to your section commander.
- No ma'am. We decided

37:39.590 --> 37:41.956
to hide it, until we could
figure out what to do.

37:41.990 --> 37:44.481
- Joe and I did. Pete
wanted to report it, ma'am.

37:44.530 --> 37:46.953
- Tom, don't.
-_It's_ OK._ There's
no p0int in lying anymore.

37:46.990 --> 37:49.652
- And after the fight in the bar
we thought Pete changed his mind

37:49.700 --> 37:52.692
and ran off with the money.
I'm sorry, buddy.

37:52.730 --> 37:55.790
- In the boys' defense,
Colonel, when push came to shove

37:55.840 --> 37:57.899
they did the right thing.
- Don't get me started with you.

37:57.940 --> 38:00.306
You've done nothing but lie
to me since the beginning.

38:00.340 --> 38:03.969
And it goes without saying
I am deeply disappointed in you.

38:04.010 --> 38:07.502
Report to the Master
Steward. Dismissed.

38:07.550 --> 38:09.973
Not you,
Private Caplan.

38:13.550 --> 38:16.383
The one thing these two
did do right

38:16.420 --> 38:18.422
was convince me to issue you
a leave pass for the weekend.

38:18.460 --> 38:21.554
Seems someone is
very eager to see you.

38:25.530 --> 38:28.966
***

38:39.410 --> 38:41.810
- Hey!
- Oh my god!

38:41.850 --> 38:45.786
- Mom!
- You scared me so much!

38:45.820 --> 38:48.516
- I know. I'm fine.

38:48.560 --> 38:51.552
- Hey, uh...

38:51.590 --> 38:53.956
Cuban cigars for real
this time. If you hadn't

38:53.990 --> 38:56.754
made that call to the base, I
don't think things would have
turned out so well for us.

38:56.800 --> 39:00.019
- I'll take the cigars.
But if I'm being honest,

39:00.070 --> 39:02.698
it was that daughter
of yours. She made me do it.

39:02.740 --> 39:05.504
- Oh yeah!

39:05.540 --> 39:08.429
Yeah, she can be
surprisingly persuasive.

39:11.080 --> 39:15.449
***

39:15.480 --> 39:17.914
- Oh yeah_, I'm fine.

39:17.950 --> 39:20.589
Back on my feet
in a couple of days.

39:32.530 --> 39:34.566
- What does a missing
army soldier have to do

39:34.600 --> 39:37.091
with a 20
Find out this week

39:37.140 --> 39:39.506
on a very special
Breakfast with Becca.

39:39.540 --> 39:41.679
- Hey, Matt!
- Hey!

39:41.710 --> 39:44.873
- Pretty exciting stuff!
- The network was so thrilled

39:44.910 --> 39:46.707
they scheduled
an extra hour for her.

39:46.750 --> 39:49.947
- Great! I'm gonna start dinner.

39:49.980 --> 39:52.483
- And by that you mean,
"I'll go in the pantry

39:52.520 --> 39:55.751
and eat all the pretzels"?
- Hey! It's just part
of my process.

39:55.790 --> 39:58.918
- Hey, Honey.
- Hey!

39:58.960 --> 40:00.928
- I heard you were throwing
your weight around down

40:00.960 --> 40:04.020
at the police station.
- Uh, I was scared.

40:04.060 --> 40:06.062
I'm sorry.

40:06.100 --> 40:08.591
- No, don't apologize.
It was brave.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.198
And it made me
think that, um,

40:10.240 --> 40:12.162
maybe I've been
underestimating you.

40:12.210 --> 40:15.668
So... I got you something.

40:19.750 --> 40:22.617
An Italian phrase book?
- I never want you to feel

40:22.650 --> 40:24.447
like there's anything
holding you back.

40:24.490 --> 40:26.583
Especially me.

40:26.620 --> 40:30.511
- Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.

40:35.730 --> 40:38.563
- Hi Ken. I know things have
been weird lately. I thought

40:38.600 --> 40:40.591
I'd come by so we could talk.

40:40.630 --> 40:44.066
Lemme know if
that's a problem. Bye.

40:44.100 --> 40:47.206
Oh hey, you're still here!
- Hey! Yeah,

40:47.240 --> 40:50.676
we were just, uh...
- ...Talking.

40:50.710 --> 40:53.076
- ...Talking, yeah. We were
just talking about, uh...

40:53.110 --> 40:55.112
- ...Current events.
- ...Current events, you know.

40:55.150 --> 40:57.243
It's a crazy
world out there, eh?

40:57.280 --> 41:00.010
- And in here, apparently.

41:00.050 --> 41:03.019
Zoe, lock up for me, please?
- Mm-hm! No problem!

41:03.060 --> 41:05.483
- See ya!

41:07.530 --> 41:10.522
Did I just get you in trouble?
Is that what just happened?

41:10.560 --> 41:13.688

41:16.840 --> 41:19.229
- Hey, Mel!

41:19.270 --> 41:22.239
Are you OK? I just heard.
- Ah yeah. it's just a scratch.

41:24.610 --> 41:27.647
I feel like I need to see you.

41:27.680 --> 41:30.717
- Um...

41:30.750 --> 41:33.548
I'm sorry, I forgot.
