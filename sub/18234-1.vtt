06:29.422 --> 06:33.392
- Are you chewing gum and
smoking at the same time?
- Holy shit!

06:33.394 --> 06:34.426
- What?

06:34.428 --> 06:37.162
- Are you chewing gum
and smoking,

06:37.164 --> 06:40.298
- at the same time?
- What the fuck is happening?

06:40.300 --> 06:42.501
Holy shit.

06:45.938 --> 06:48.340
- Keep driving.
- Get the fuck out of my car!

06:48.342 --> 06:50.675
- Keep driving.
- No!

06:52.845 --> 06:55.914
- Oh my god, okay.
- It's me.

06:56.616 --> 06:58.450
- What?

06:59.452 --> 07:01.686
- It's me.
Keep driving.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.363
- You're, you're--
- don't say my name.

07:15.368 --> 07:17.803
- Uh...

07:20.206 --> 07:21.640
Okay.

07:21.642 --> 07:22.941
- Get back on the road.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.377
- Wow. Yeah.

07:26.045 --> 07:27.879
Yeah.

07:30.416 --> 07:32.017
Can I ask you some questions?

07:32.019 --> 07:33.819
- No.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.787
- Okay. Can I just--
- no.

07:35.789 --> 07:39.057
- We don't talk about
any of this in the car.

07:39.059 --> 07:42.394
- Oh, yeah, no, no, no
the car's not bugged.

07:44.397 --> 07:46.531
The--

07:46.533 --> 07:48.667
excuse me.
The car's not bugged.

07:48.669 --> 07:51.837
- You left it unlocked
at the gas station.

07:55.174 --> 07:58.243
- Uh... okay.

07:58.911 --> 08:01.513
Yeah, okay.

08:01.515 --> 08:04.182
But can i--
is it alright if I confirm...

08:04.184 --> 08:05.884
- Just kind of...
- You're Abe richek.

08:05.886 --> 08:12.557
- Your social security
number is 988-64-4323.

08:12.559 --> 08:14.192
You checked into
a hotel at missoula.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.661
You called your girlfriend
at 11:17 pm.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.396
At 12:13 am

08:18.398 --> 08:21.500
you called a woman
who is not your girlfriend.

08:21.502 --> 08:22.567
I'm the one
you're here to meet.

08:22.569 --> 08:24.536
Now let's go.

08:31.143 --> 08:32.878
- Ooh.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.779
Yeah, yes.

08:34.780 --> 08:35.947
Can you--
do you mind--

08:35.948 --> 08:37.349
do you wanna just
get in the front seat?

08:37.351 --> 08:39.251
- Will you get back
on the road?

08:39.253 --> 08:40.418
- Yeah.

08:40.419 --> 08:43.421
Yeah, just come--
come join me up here.

08:43.423 --> 08:45.357
It's been lonely.

08:45.992 --> 08:47.125
- Okay, let's go.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.094
- Alright, which way?

08:49.295 --> 08:51.096
- North.

08:51.163 --> 08:52.931
- Okay.

08:57.136 --> 08:59.604
Yes. Right.
This way.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.586
It's a method.

09:15.855 --> 09:17.656
It's a method for quitting.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.724
The cigarette,
it's not lit.

09:19.726 --> 09:20.825
I just hold it there

09:20.827 --> 09:24.563
and chew the gum
at the same time.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.133
- Let me see your phone.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.936
- Sure.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.104
You can see what apps
are running if--

09:33.106 --> 09:36.141
there's a settings button
you can go to on the right...

09:37.343 --> 09:39.344
Oh my goodness.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.581
Okay, or that works.

09:49.288 --> 09:52.958
What would you have done
if it was a phone

09:52.960 --> 09:55.694
that you couldn't have
taken the battery out of?

09:57.296 --> 10:00.432
- Why'd you become
a journalist?

10:00.434 --> 10:02.601
- Serious question?

10:03.402 --> 10:05.303
Oh, uh...

10:05.305 --> 10:06.504
Why...

10:06.506 --> 10:09.674
What made me
become a journalist?

10:09.676 --> 10:11.710
The money.

10:14.747 --> 10:19.884
I think that I - I identify
and for a long time have,

10:19.886 --> 10:25.357
have seen myself as someone
who cares a lot about the truth.

10:25.359 --> 10:26.858
You know.
And I'm not naive.

10:26.860 --> 10:32.564
I recognize that there's
a lot of moral relativity

10:32.566 --> 10:35.400
and moral ambiguity
and uncertainty in the world,

10:35.402 --> 10:36.801
and in the worlds
that we create,

10:36.803 --> 10:40.238
but the truth does exist.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.406
I think.

10:41.408 --> 10:44.476
Or I try to act that way.

10:45.845 --> 10:48.813
Ugh, that sounded
pretentious to me.

10:48.815 --> 10:54.052
Well, maybe it is a little bit
pretentious...

10:54.054 --> 10:57.155
I think that some people come
to journalism as storytellers.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.858
People who want to move
the reader emotionally.

10:59.860 --> 11:04.262
And I don't.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.031
I'm more interested in truth,

11:06.033 --> 11:07.866
regardless of how
they feel about it.

11:12.705 --> 11:15.273
- That's a good answer.

11:16.842 --> 11:18.910
- Why do you do what you do?

11:18.912 --> 11:20.211
- You can pull in
by these silos.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.080
We can talk there.

11:22.381 --> 11:24.349
- Great.

12:27.913 --> 12:30.014
- Let me search you.

12:31.283 --> 12:32.784
- Uh, no.

12:32.786 --> 12:33.985
Okay, I'm sorry but no.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.454
You, you have to trust me,
alright?

12:36.456 --> 12:38.156
I've got a professional
code of conduct.

12:38.158 --> 12:41.159
I have a personal
code of ethics.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.627
You trust me
to keep you unattributed,

12:42.629 --> 12:46.331
you have to trust I'm not
recording you, okay?

12:48.434 --> 12:51.169
- No. I have still
have to search you.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.204
It'll be quick.

12:55.908 --> 12:56.674
- Fine.

12:56.676 --> 12:58.042
What do I have to do?

12:58.044 --> 12:59.511
- Turn around.

12:59.513 --> 13:01.446
Spread your arms.

13:06.152 --> 13:08.486
This is not a small thing,
you understand.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.355
- I do.

13:25.504 --> 13:27.872
Might be easier just
to strip me, if you want.

13:27.874 --> 13:30.241
- Be careful what you ask for.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.880
- Can I put my arms down?

13:35.882 --> 13:37.849
- Keep them out of my way.

13:37.851 --> 13:40.351
And don't put them
in your pockets.

13:50.362 --> 13:52.764
- We are both
in the same boat.

13:54.867 --> 13:57.101
We both have something to lose.

14:02.374 --> 14:03.274
Is that it?

14:03.276 --> 14:04.676
- One more thing.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.411
Cover your ears, this is
going to be extremely loud.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.213
- What is that?
- Cover your ears.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.080
- What are you doing?

14:09.082 --> 14:10.682
Jesus, fuck!

14:10.684 --> 14:12.517
Oh fuck!

14:41.814 --> 14:44.916
I probably shouldn't even ask
what you're doing right now.

14:49.855 --> 14:52.657
- Aren't you afraid
of treasure hunters?
- No.

15:02.302 --> 15:05.136
You're supposed to be
someone I can trust.

15:05.671 --> 15:07.338
- Who told you that?

15:07.940 --> 15:10.241
Kelly?
How do you know Kelly?

15:14.580 --> 15:17.315
- Frankly I'd prefer
to take this to larger,

15:17.317 --> 15:18.983
more reputable papers.

15:18.985 --> 15:20.251
- Sure, yeah,

15:20.253 --> 15:23.354
no, I'd prefer to work
for those papers but,

15:23.356 --> 15:26.357
ya know, here we are.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.428
- I'll give you thirty minutes.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.496
And that's it.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.031
No follow-up,
no phone call, no email.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.966
So make it count.

15:34.968 --> 15:36.834
- I understand.

15:36.836 --> 15:42.173
Okay, so first I need you
to acknowledge who you are.

15:42.175 --> 15:43.775
Just to me.

15:43.777 --> 15:46.110
You can't be totally anonymous
otherwise it's deep background

15:46.112 --> 15:47.612
and I can't use that.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.280
And since you're the
only source for the story,

15:49.282 --> 15:51.950
that means we got nothing,
there's no story.

15:51.952 --> 15:54.018
- You know who I am.

15:54.020 --> 15:55.720
- Uh...

15:55.722 --> 15:58.289
Well, you've very artfully
communicated it

15:58.291 --> 16:00.825
in extremely indirect ways.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.860
But I need you to be direct
on a couple points

16:02.862 --> 16:05.363
otherwise there's,
i mean, there's no foundation.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.332
I can't publish.

16:12.905 --> 16:13.972
Okay?

16:13.974 --> 16:15.540
- We're going to do this?
- Yeah.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.241
- Great.

16:18.110 --> 16:19.510
Uh, Debra?

16:19.512 --> 16:21.579
Right?
Debra Bratton?

16:24.083 --> 16:25.350
- Yes.
- Good.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.352
- And you work for?

16:32.691 --> 16:34.826
You can say it.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.894
- I, uh...

16:36.896 --> 16:39.364
It's--

16:39.366 --> 16:40.732
- you have to tell me,
i can't guess.

16:40.734 --> 16:41.733
- You know it.

16:41.735 --> 16:43.668
- That doesn't cut it.

16:49.441 --> 16:51.542
- Here.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.282
Got that?

16:58.284 --> 17:00.351
- I think so.

17:02.554 --> 17:04.288
Alright, I'm not going
to write your name down,

17:04.290 --> 17:06.590
I'm not going to write
any proper nouns

17:06.593 --> 17:09.394
that we're using here,
I'll use a shorthand.

17:09.396 --> 17:10.728
- Yeah.

17:10.730 --> 17:13.931
- I'll keep this notebook
literally on my person

17:13.933 --> 17:15.599
at all points
and then I'll destroy it

17:15.602 --> 17:16.634
as soon as I've
written the story.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.368
Does that sound alright?

17:18.371 --> 17:19.737
Great.

17:19.739 --> 17:22.607
So Debra,
your position is what?

17:22.608 --> 17:23.808
An information analyst?

17:23.810 --> 17:27.078
- Uh, senior information
processing engineer.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.279
- Okay.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.314
Um, and what's a general way
to refer to you

17:30.316 --> 17:31.949
that's also accurate?

17:31.951 --> 17:33.484
- What do you mean?

17:33.486 --> 17:35.720
- I mean, like, if I'm quoting
the mayor's chief of staff,

17:35.722 --> 17:37.889
and he's not going
on the record I might say

17:37.891 --> 17:40.124
he's a "senior city
hall official."

17:40.126 --> 17:42.260
Can I refer to you
as a senior analyst?

17:42.262 --> 17:43.661
- No, not really.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.997
Senior's in my title
but I'm not senior.

17:45.999 --> 17:47.632
Not like that.
Not like you'd think.

17:47.634 --> 17:50.835
It's just there to distinguish
me from all the other ghosts.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.503
The pure code guys.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.672
- Did you say "ghosts?"

17:55.574 --> 17:56.974
- Like pac-man.

17:56.976 --> 18:00.478
They're ghosts
and I'm pac-man.

18:00.480 --> 18:04.082
Or in my case Ms. pac-man.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.483
- Do they call you that?

18:05.485 --> 18:07.985
- Just in the office.

18:07.987 --> 18:10.354
It's not on my business cards.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.958
- It's good.
Can I use it?

18:13.960 --> 18:15.593
- No.
Absolutely not.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.996
That's exactly the sort of
personal detail I don't want.

18:18.998 --> 18:21.332
And I'd prefer you don't
even include my gender

18:21.334 --> 18:23.634
as that's an enormous
clue to who I am

18:23.636 --> 18:26.204
in an agency that's 80% male.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.840
With a job title that I share
with maybe twenty other women.

18:28.842 --> 18:30.041
- Yes, I understand.

18:30.043 --> 18:32.877
- I don't want this
to be about me, at all.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.982
You know why people
like snowden fucked up?

18:37.984 --> 18:39.684
Because they became the story.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.519
All anybody was interested in

18:41.521 --> 18:43.688
was snowden
in that dumb airport

18:43.690 --> 18:46.891
or Manning and his
gender identity shit

18:46.893 --> 18:49.794
or assange and his
disappearing condoms.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.529
Everyone focused
on the human element.

18:51.531 --> 18:54.699
I don't want any of this to
be about the human element.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.467
- I understand.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.871
I - I guarantee you
that I have no interest

18:59.873 --> 19:01.506
in making you famous.

19:01.508 --> 19:02.707
You're not my story.

19:02.709 --> 19:03.975
If the content
of what you have,

19:03.977 --> 19:05.343
what you're offering
is good enough.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.845
If it's strong enough,
then you're not important.

19:07.847 --> 19:11.482
But, please understand,
i have to verify that you exist.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.885
Right? I gotta verify
who you are

19:13.887 --> 19:15.219
and how you know
what you know.

19:15.221 --> 19:17.021
That I'm not just passing
along some kind of rumor

19:17.023 --> 19:18.089
that I heard second hand.

19:18.091 --> 19:20.024
- I can see that.
That's sound.

19:20.026 --> 19:21.425
- Right?

19:21.427 --> 19:25.062
I mean, we gotta, we gotta
trust each other, alright?

19:25.064 --> 19:26.330
We gotta be partners.

19:26.332 --> 19:28.566
This only works if we
are absolutely rigorous.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.434
- First.

19:32.204 --> 19:34.438
- Can I pick that up?

19:45.450 --> 19:47.418
Is that so you can say
you didn't give this to me?

19:47.420 --> 19:49.587
- I didn't give it to you.

19:51.056 --> 19:52.790
- Alright, I'll look at it
as soon as I can tonight.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.926
- Abe.

19:55.894 --> 19:59.130
Did you see that car arrive?

19:59.132 --> 20:02.233
It wasn't here
when we got here, was it?

20:04.803 --> 20:06.804
- I don't know.

20:06.806 --> 20:09.106
No. I didn't see it
but it's a long way off.

20:09.108 --> 20:11.142
It's probably just some farmer.

20:11.144 --> 20:12.310
- I don't like it.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.946
Let's go somewhere else.

20:14.948 --> 20:16.781
- Well, hang on.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.449
Look, if that's
somebody following us

20:18.451 --> 20:20.418
then what are they doing
just sitting out there

20:20.420 --> 20:23.120
in the open
where it's so obvious?

20:26.158 --> 20:28.092
Goddamn it.

21:08.533 --> 21:10.534
- Take a left on bofer,

21:11.436 --> 21:14.272
and then head west,
towards pasco.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.885
Left.

21:35.060 --> 21:36.961
- Hold on.
- What are you--

21:36.963 --> 21:37.962
- what are you doing?

21:37.964 --> 21:39.697
- I want to see
this mystery car.

21:39.699 --> 21:42.533
- No, I told you.
We need to get out of here.

21:42.901 --> 21:45.136
- If they're watching us,
they're watching us.

21:45.138 --> 21:47.538
I just wanna--
i just wanna see who it is.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.740
- This isn't a fucking game.

21:49.742 --> 21:50.841
- I know that.

21:50.843 --> 21:52.810
- You have no idea
what you're doing.

22:13.031 --> 22:15.066
- Huh.

22:15.068 --> 22:16.901
- Okay,
so you've had your look.

22:16.903 --> 22:18.402
Let's go.

22:18.870 --> 22:20.771
- I want to go see it.

23:23.001 --> 23:24.902
Hello!

23:31.276 --> 23:34.979
I don't think that--
i don't think anybody's here.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.783
It's weird though,

23:39.918 --> 23:41.185
I'll Grant you that.

23:41.187 --> 23:43.254
Leaving a car here...

23:43.256 --> 23:45.790
It's probably
a farming thing that...

23:45.792 --> 23:48.459
I don't know anything about.

23:57.702 --> 23:59.336
Whoo! Alright.

23:59.338 --> 24:02.606
See?
We are a-ok.

24:03.475 --> 24:05.709
- That's not the point.

24:07.779 --> 24:10.648
- I'm very curious to hear
what the point is.

24:10.650 --> 24:11.882
Alright,
where do you wanna go?

24:11.884 --> 24:14.185
You want to head back
to the gas station?

24:14.187 --> 24:15.386
We set this up for months.

24:15.388 --> 24:16.554
You drove
all the way out here.

24:16.556 --> 24:17.955
You're gonna get
spooked by this?

24:17.957 --> 24:19.056
You're gonna get
spooked by a car,

24:19.058 --> 24:21.826
sitting in a field, alone.

24:29.267 --> 24:32.536
- Go back and turn left
on bofer.

24:32.538 --> 24:35.072
Towards pasco.

24:38.410 --> 24:40.177
- Great.

25:37.469 --> 25:39.136
- You think I'm paranoid.

25:39.138 --> 25:40.471
- No, I don't.

25:40.473 --> 25:42.740
I think that it seems
like an excess of caution,

25:42.742 --> 25:44.775
but I admit that I don't know.

25:44.777 --> 25:48.445
What you know, I don't know
everything you know...

25:48.447 --> 25:51.949
Let's not get scared
of ghosts, how 'bout that?

25:51.951 --> 25:54.084
- I'm Ms. pac man, remember?

25:54.086 --> 25:55.986
I can eat the ghosts.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.555
- Yeah!

25:57.557 --> 25:59.323
I don't doubt that
for a second.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.258
This my left?

26:27.185 --> 26:30.321
- They're following us.

26:30.323 --> 26:33.791
They just pulled out
and turned after us.

26:33.793 --> 26:36.126
- No, that's not the same...

26:36.628 --> 26:37.828
Is that the same car?

26:37.830 --> 26:40.197
- Of course it's the same car.
Speed up.

26:41.199 --> 26:42.633
- Uh... sure yeah...

26:42.635 --> 26:44.668
You know,
i don't want to go...

26:44.670 --> 26:46.704
We don't want to
get pulled over.

26:48.473 --> 26:50.975
You see what they look like?

26:50.977 --> 26:53.544
- No, not in the mirror.

26:53.546 --> 26:54.545
I don't want to turn around.

26:54.547 --> 26:56.714
I don't want them
to see my face.

27:00.552 --> 27:03.220
At this intersection
take the left,

27:03.222 --> 27:05.556
and then we'll take
our next right.

27:05.558 --> 27:08.993
The odds of them randomly
going that way are...

27:08.995 --> 27:10.694
- Yeah.

27:21.106 --> 27:23.240
- Keep your eyes
on the road.

27:43.161 --> 27:46.697
Okay, that right up there,
we'll take that.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.539
Right here.

28:01.880 --> 28:04.348
- They could not possibly...

28:04.350 --> 28:05.949
There's literally nothing here.

28:05.951 --> 28:08.052
- Stop here.

28:09.554 --> 28:11.789
Keep it in drive.

28:58.069 --> 29:00.604
- Would you like to start over?

30:05.270 --> 30:07.871
Alright, how about this?

30:09.908 --> 30:11.542
I'li tell you a story.

30:11.544 --> 30:13.744
- Do you have to?

30:13.746 --> 30:15.879
- It'll have nothing
to do with anything.

30:15.881 --> 30:17.214
Just something for me
to gab about

30:17.216 --> 30:19.750
and you can ignore it
if you want to.

30:20.351 --> 30:21.985
How's that sound?

30:21.987 --> 30:23.854
- Great.
- Great.

30:23.856 --> 30:26.690
- Alright, so,

30:26.692 --> 30:29.593
when I was a kid I grew up
about an hour west of Chicago

30:29.595 --> 30:31.595
in a little town called dekalb.

30:31.597 --> 30:33.197
University town.

30:33.199 --> 30:37.067
Probably forty,
fifty thousand people.

30:37.069 --> 30:39.169
My mom was
a sociology professor

30:39.171 --> 30:41.238
and my dad worked
for the county.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.106
- You don't have a dad.

30:43.108 --> 30:45.242
- Sorry, uh...

30:45.244 --> 30:47.711
- Is this even a true story?

30:48.947 --> 30:50.013
- Do you have--

30:50.015 --> 30:52.916
this is kind of
a personal question.

30:52.918 --> 30:55.018
Do you have...

30:56.888 --> 30:58.188
Asperger's?

30:58.190 --> 30:59.690
- What's wrong with you?

30:59.692 --> 31:01.892
- What?
It's just a curiosity.

31:01.894 --> 31:03.760
- You are barely
in my good graces.

31:03.762 --> 31:05.429
- There's no stigma.
A lot of perfectly--

31:05.431 --> 31:06.630
- just stop.

31:06.632 --> 31:08.398
Stop!

31:09.834 --> 31:12.035
- Very intelligent--
- stop!

31:17.842 --> 31:21.578
- Alright, so one mom
was a sociology professor

31:21.580 --> 31:24.114
the other worked
for the county.

31:24.116 --> 31:27.484
Very small town feel.

31:27.486 --> 31:32.122
Lots of big houses,
big yards, plenty of trees.

31:32.124 --> 31:35.726
Pretty classic sitcom setting
apart from the relative

31:35.728 --> 31:38.395
trailblazing on the
part of my parents.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.765
So one early spring weekday,

31:41.767 --> 31:43.233
and I remember
that it was a weekday

31:43.235 --> 31:44.935
because my parents weren't home,

31:44.937 --> 31:47.771
we went out
to the common area

31:47.773 --> 31:50.774
and there was this circular
grove of cherry trees,

31:50.776 --> 31:54.978
the grove had been planted
way back by the city fathers

31:54.980 --> 31:57.581
or whoever.

31:57.583 --> 32:01.852
And, so at this point
we had twelve, fifteen

32:01.854 --> 32:05.656
really beautiful
mature cherry trees.

32:05.658 --> 32:09.860
White pink flowers,
really stunning.

32:09.862 --> 32:12.262
You could see them for
miles and miles and miles.

32:12.264 --> 32:16.199
But today, this day,
they had transformed.

32:16.201 --> 32:21.305
And they were this nasty
green-black combination.

32:25.810 --> 32:28.545
And they were shimmering.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.814
Which is not exactly
the right word.

32:30.816 --> 32:33.984
Not like leaves
in the wind shimmering,

32:33.986 --> 32:38.455
but like the surface of water,
if the water was thick,

32:38.457 --> 32:41.725
like a sludge.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.860
I had obviously never done
drugs at that point in my life

32:43.862 --> 32:48.999
but it was...
It was like I was high.

32:49.001 --> 32:53.737
It was so wrong
and fundamentally unnatural.

32:53.739 --> 32:55.205
So we got closer,
you know,

32:55.207 --> 32:56.707
we want to see
what's going on,

32:56.709 --> 33:00.477
and we discover that
covering these trees,

33:00.479 --> 33:02.512
literally covering
every inch of these trees

33:02.514 --> 33:05.082
are these thousands
and thousands of

33:05.084 --> 33:09.553
green-black caterpillars.

33:09.555 --> 33:10.721
Every tree.

33:10.723 --> 33:11.922
And they were going to town.

33:11.924 --> 33:14.558
They were eating the leaves
and the stems

33:14.560 --> 33:16.426
and everything,
everything.

33:16.428 --> 33:17.928
And it was only the
cherry trees, I remember,

33:17.930 --> 33:20.097
for whatever reason
they weren't interested

33:20.099 --> 33:22.599
in any of the others.

33:22.601 --> 33:23.600
And...

33:23.602 --> 33:25.268
- Turn here.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:26.270 --> 33:30.240
And so we get up closer
and it's just this,

33:30.242 --> 33:36.346
like, gross and horrifying

33:36.348 --> 33:40.751
and amazing sight
and it's cool.

33:40.753 --> 33:42.352
But we knew that these trees
were a big deal

33:42.354 --> 33:44.388
so we went over to my
buddy Todd's house--

33:44.390 --> 33:46.690
- this is good,
let's stop here.

34:01.572 --> 34:03.874
- Do you want to get out?

34:04.242 --> 34:06.977
- No. Let's just sit here
for a while.

34:19.524 --> 34:21.458
So what happened?

34:21.460 --> 34:23.393
- Hmm?

34:25.329 --> 34:27.431
- D'you spray 'em?

34:27.433 --> 34:29.065
- Oh, uh, no.

34:29.068 --> 34:32.135
I guess there
wasn't time for that.

34:32.137 --> 34:33.670
We...
Todd's dad saw them,

34:33.672 --> 34:35.672
and he freaked out.

34:35.674 --> 34:38.641
Which was cool to see
an adult share your level

34:38.643 --> 34:40.476
of excitement about something.

34:40.478 --> 34:42.813
And he ran home

34:42.815 --> 34:45.482
and got on the landline
and called another dad.

34:45.484 --> 34:49.786
And the two of them
got out there with ladders

34:49.788 --> 34:54.024
and these big old
plastic buckets.

34:54.025 --> 34:57.994
And they got up there
and just started yanking

34:57.996 --> 35:00.430
fistfuls of caterpillars.

35:00.432 --> 35:05.936
They were tent caterpillars,
i found out later.

35:05.938 --> 35:07.871
And evidently,
every couple years

35:07.873 --> 35:11.174
there's just this
explosion of them.

35:11.176 --> 35:12.642
So we get these adults

35:12.644 --> 35:16.346
and they're throwing
caterpillars into the buckets.

35:16.348 --> 35:21.718
And we're eight so we're trying
to be as helpful as possible.

35:21.720 --> 35:26.056
And whenever these buckets
would get nearly full,

35:26.058 --> 35:27.958
we would take 'em down.

35:27.960 --> 35:31.128
And they were heavy.

35:31.130 --> 35:33.797
We'd take em down,
and there was a ditch nearby,

35:33.799 --> 35:37.000
and we'd pour em out into
the ditch and bring 'em back.

35:37.002 --> 35:42.539
And after probably
an hour or so of this

35:42.541 --> 35:44.875
we'd gotten most
of 'em off the trees,

35:44.877 --> 35:47.878
barring a couple dozen
stragglers or so.

35:47.880 --> 35:52.382
Meanwhile this ditch is
waist-high full of caterpillars.

35:52.384 --> 35:55.685
And one of the dads
went back to his house

35:55.687 --> 35:57.888
or his garage or something.

35:57.890 --> 36:02.759
And he had got a gas can
and brought it back.

36:02.761 --> 36:08.498
And they were just about to
start pouring it on this ditch.

36:08.500 --> 36:12.435
Um, and then I just...

36:12.437 --> 36:16.840
Like, I just ran out there

36:16.842 --> 36:18.341
and grabbed a bucket

36:18.343 --> 36:22.445
and started grabbing
caterpillars.

36:23.614 --> 36:25.582
- Why?

36:26.851 --> 36:28.118
- I don't' know.

36:28.120 --> 36:30.253
I didn't-- I certainly
didn't know at the time.

36:30.255 --> 36:34.291
I think that it was just,

36:34.293 --> 36:36.026
ya know,
i think was awful

36:36.028 --> 36:38.428
to see them about to get
destroyed like that.

36:38.430 --> 36:41.298
I think that was really awful.

36:41.300 --> 36:44.734
And I think I had the idea
that maybe I could save some.

36:44.736 --> 36:46.036
I didn't know what for.

36:46.038 --> 36:48.271
Later on,
i figured out something.

36:48.273 --> 36:53.944
But that initial impulse
is tough to explain.

36:53.946 --> 36:57.814
They let me keep, like, uh,
fifty or sixty of them

36:57.816 --> 36:59.382
and they...

36:59.384 --> 37:01.651
I had to promise to keep them
away from the trees.

37:01.653 --> 37:05.121
And, the adults,
they backed all of us kids up,

37:05.123 --> 37:06.056
way, way, way, back,

37:06.058 --> 37:08.291
and one of them
took the gas can

37:08.293 --> 37:09.926
and he poured gas
all over the ditch,

37:09.928 --> 37:14.898
and another one
flicked a match onto it.

37:14.900 --> 37:21.238
And... just this
enormous fireball.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.273
And, uh...

37:23.275 --> 37:25.175
- Let's get out.

38:05.983 --> 38:08.351
- Here we are again.

38:11.622 --> 38:13.056
- So what happened?

38:13.058 --> 38:15.191
- With what?

38:15.193 --> 38:17.027
- Uh, caterpillars.

38:17.029 --> 38:18.862
- Oh. Does this coming out
of my half-hour?

38:18.864 --> 38:20.630
- Keep it tight.
- Okay.

38:20.632 --> 38:23.066
- Uh, where was I?

38:23.501 --> 38:25.702
- Uh... fireball.

38:25.704 --> 38:27.537
- Yeah, right!
- Pocket full of caterpillars.

38:27.539 --> 38:30.240
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.
So, um...

38:30.242 --> 38:32.542
Have you ever heard
the bill cosby routine

38:32.544 --> 38:36.212
about saving a snowball
for the summer?

38:36.214 --> 38:37.714
Oh man. Okay.

38:37.716 --> 38:40.650
It's good.
You should check it out.

38:40.652 --> 38:43.920
Anyway, so, uh,

38:43.922 --> 38:46.690
I've got these, like,
fifty, sixty caterpillars

38:46.692 --> 38:50.160
and I figure
I'll take 'em home,

38:50.162 --> 38:52.095
they turn into cocoon's
and you know,

38:52.097 --> 38:53.563
in my little science brain,

38:53.565 --> 38:55.699
then I'd have butterflies,
right?

38:55.701 --> 38:59.402
A whole basket of butterflies
to surprise my moms with.

38:59.404 --> 39:02.739
I thought it would be
a very, very sweet gesture.

39:02.741 --> 39:06.242
They ended up separating
when I was in college.

39:06.244 --> 39:10.380
And then my mom Cindy
passed away last year.

39:10.382 --> 39:11.681
Which I'm sure you...

39:11.683 --> 39:13.249
- Yeah, sorry.

39:13.251 --> 39:14.551
- Thank you for saying that.

39:14.553 --> 39:16.419
It is what it is.

39:16.421 --> 39:19.956
So, so Patrick's dad
gives me this coffee can

39:19.958 --> 39:22.759
and I put 'em in there,
and I take 'em home,

39:22.761 --> 39:24.260
and I put 'em in the basement

39:24.262 --> 39:27.297
where I know nobody but me
is ever going to look for them.

39:27.299 --> 39:33.770
And then I every day just keep
bringing 'em leaves and water,

39:33.772 --> 39:35.739
and I wait.

39:35.741 --> 39:39.976
But I notice something
kind of weird is happening.

39:39.978 --> 39:41.444
I started, ya know,
with like,

39:41.446 --> 39:44.047
fifty or sixty caterpillars,
at least

39:44.049 --> 39:47.817
and now at this point,
maybe I've got thirty tops.

39:47.819 --> 39:50.954
So, I can them out
of the coffee tin,

39:50.956 --> 39:53.556
I picked out
a couple dead ones,

39:53.558 --> 39:56.960
but it didn't make sense,
the math didn't add up.

39:56.962 --> 39:58.628
And then a couple days later

39:58.630 --> 40:01.131
I figured out
what was going on.

40:01.133 --> 40:03.900
Ya know,
start with fifty,

40:04.335 --> 40:11.408
thirty, twenty, ten,
and then finally three.

40:12.843 --> 40:18.581
Three enormous,
disgusting caterpillars

40:18.583 --> 40:20.483
with the remains
of all of their brothers

40:20.485 --> 40:22.952
and sisters inside of them.

40:22.954 --> 40:25.989
You can imagine the
feelings that I had as a kid.

40:25.991 --> 40:30.660
This was supposed to be this
really sweet thing for my moms,

40:30.662 --> 40:34.631
and it had become
a nightmare.

40:34.633 --> 40:36.833
I took 'em out
onto the concrete,

40:36.835 --> 40:39.502
grabbed a big hammer,

40:39.504 --> 40:44.774
and I smashed down
as hard as I fucking could.

40:53.417 --> 40:56.219
I never told anybody that story.

41:02.660 --> 41:03.860
What?

41:06.898 --> 41:08.731
- What?

41:14.505 --> 41:16.206
- Why would you
tell me that story?

41:16.208 --> 41:19.342
- I don't know.
I don't know.

41:19.344 --> 41:21.377
I wanted to tell a story.

41:21.379 --> 41:23.480
I don't like silence,
i just started talking.

41:23.482 --> 41:25.081
It came-- I don't--

41:25.083 --> 41:27.917
- jeez, Louise.
- Okay. Okay...

41:33.290 --> 41:35.859
What?!

41:35.861 --> 41:37.760
- It's just, it's, uh...

41:40.498 --> 41:44.033
- I assume there's some
kind of encryption key.

41:44.035 --> 41:48.004
- In 2010 and 2011,
you lived with a woman, right?

41:48.006 --> 41:49.706
- Yeah.

41:49.708 --> 41:51.207
- Your current
license plate number

41:51.209 --> 41:54.544
and her mother's maiden name,
interchanged.

41:54.546 --> 41:56.746
But everything reversed.

41:56.748 --> 42:00.583
So, last digit of
the license plate first,

42:00.585 --> 42:03.353
then last of the name.

42:03.355 --> 42:05.255
Then it alternates.
Make sense?

42:05.257 --> 42:10.260
- Five, a, nine, I.

42:10.262 --> 42:12.262
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Like that, right?

42:12.264 --> 42:14.197
- First letter
of the last name cap,

42:14.199 --> 42:16.032
the rest lowercase.

42:16.034 --> 42:18.601
License plate number all caps.

42:18.603 --> 42:19.702
- Okay.

42:19.704 --> 42:21.905
So these files contain
what exactly?

42:21.907 --> 42:23.306
- About two-thousand names.

42:23.308 --> 42:26.776
Their last known location,
previous address,

42:26.778 --> 42:28.978
profession sometimes,
social security number,

42:28.980 --> 42:31.214
phone, email, ip.

42:31.216 --> 42:32.982
- And what is important
about them?

42:32.984 --> 42:35.285
- You're going to
have to find out.

42:36.654 --> 42:38.888
- What prompted
this change of heart?

42:38.890 --> 42:40.790
Is it what this list is,
or represents?

42:40.792 --> 42:42.592
Something in the news--

42:42.594 --> 42:45.628
- what do you mean,
change of heart?

42:45.630 --> 42:48.131
- A shift of values.

42:48.133 --> 42:51.834
I mean, it sounds like
something of an awakening, no?

42:51.836 --> 42:53.436
- No.

42:54.572 --> 42:55.738
- No?

42:55.740 --> 42:58.641
- No, I haven't had
a change of heart.

42:58.643 --> 43:00.643
- Then why are you doing this?

43:00.645 --> 43:03.580
- Because I hold what I do
to a high standard.

43:03.582 --> 43:06.849
I think cleaning ourselves
of what's on that drive

43:06.851 --> 43:09.319
makes us better,
stronger.

43:09.321 --> 43:12.622
- And you don't conflate
whatever these abuses are

43:12.624 --> 43:15.124
to the core of what you do?

43:15.126 --> 43:17.660
- You don't think what I do
is very valuable, do you?

43:17.662 --> 43:19.262
- I think that we
shouldn't get into it.
- No.

43:19.264 --> 43:20.496
- Let's stick to facts.

43:20.498 --> 43:22.665
- No, no.
Let's get into it.

43:22.667 --> 43:25.301
Here, let's start with this.

43:25.303 --> 43:30.006
This, this device that you
think affords you privacy,

43:30.008 --> 43:31.941
did you make this?

43:31.943 --> 43:32.942
- I get it.

43:32.944 --> 43:34.844
- Do you?

43:34.846 --> 43:36.980
This incredibly complex device

43:36.982 --> 43:39.649
with thousands
of precise components

43:39.651 --> 43:41.818
assembled by people
whose lives are shit

43:41.820 --> 43:42.986
working for you.

43:42.988 --> 43:44.120
Are you under the impression

43:44.122 --> 43:46.356
that you are just
some fortunate guy.

43:46.358 --> 43:50.126
And the rest of the world wants
to work with poor eyesight

43:50.128 --> 43:51.661
and hungry stomachs
and bloody fingers

43:51.663 --> 43:53.896
for you to amuse yourself?

43:53.898 --> 43:56.232
These things do not just happen.

43:56.234 --> 44:00.303
People wield power
to make them happen.

44:00.305 --> 44:03.172
If you honestly think
you could enjoy

44:03.174 --> 44:05.074
anything close
to your lifestyle:

44:05.076 --> 44:08.144
Your iPads
and your fair trade coffee

44:08.146 --> 44:11.214
and your discount airfares,
and your press freedoms,

44:11.216 --> 44:15.852
without the threat of
enormous power behind you,

44:15.854 --> 44:17.887
you're delusional.

44:17.889 --> 44:19.722
You are a party
to these actions,

44:19.724 --> 44:23.092
you are complicit,
and deep down you know it.

44:24.995 --> 44:27.864
I do what I do
because someone has to.

44:27.866 --> 44:30.900
This world is chaos
and fear

44:30.902 --> 44:32.402
and desperation
and violence,

44:32.404 --> 44:35.104
and the only thing that has
ever brought any security

44:35.106 --> 44:36.506
and order to it

44:36.508 --> 44:40.243
is the careful and ruthless
application of power.

44:56.226 --> 44:58.361
Get in the car.

45:07.671 --> 45:10.273
Go, go, go, go , go!

45:11.975 --> 45:13.710
Okay, go.

45:31.228 --> 45:33.396
- Are they FBI?

45:33.398 --> 45:35.331
- No.

45:40.037 --> 45:42.138
- Oh shit.

45:53.584 --> 45:54.951
Fuck.

45:54.953 --> 45:57.286
Shit, shit.

46:12.469 --> 46:13.603
So if they're not cops,

46:13.605 --> 46:15.772
they clearly have
my license plate.

46:17.474 --> 46:19.275
They gonna figure out
who I am?

46:19.277 --> 46:22.111
Are they going to come
harass me back home?

46:24.314 --> 46:26.449
- Are they?
- I don't know.

46:26.451 --> 46:28.017
- You think if I thought
any of this would've happened

46:28.019 --> 46:30.520
I would have come out here?

46:30.522 --> 46:33.356
- You know what,
i have not done anything wrong.

46:33.358 --> 46:34.791
Have I?

46:34.793 --> 46:36.058
What have I done?
I met you, we talked.

46:36.060 --> 46:38.961
I told you a story
about fucking caterpillars.

46:38.963 --> 46:40.797
Huh, right?

46:44.168 --> 46:47.069
- I need you to throw the
USB drive out the window.

46:48.672 --> 46:50.640
- Okay, hang on.

46:51.074 --> 46:52.842
- What do you think
is going on here?

46:52.844 --> 46:56.045
Do you think these are just
some rednecks fucking with us?

46:56.047 --> 46:57.814
You asked
if we broke any laws,

46:57.816 --> 46:58.981
the better question is whether

46:58.983 --> 47:01.217
there's anything of value
inside this car.

47:01.219 --> 47:02.585
There are two things.

47:02.587 --> 47:05.421
What's on that drive
and what's in my head.

47:05.423 --> 47:08.891
You are only in possession
of one of them.

47:08.893 --> 47:09.826
- Yeah.

47:10.828 --> 47:12.228
Yeah, okay.

47:14.298 --> 47:17.033
- Wait until there's a turn.
I don't want them to see it.

47:43.460 --> 47:46.395
When I tell you I want you
to throw it as hard as you can

47:46.397 --> 47:48.064
away from the road.

47:48.832 --> 47:50.199
You ready?

48:08.552 --> 48:09.585
Now!

48:20.965 --> 48:22.331
Thank you.

48:22.333 --> 48:24.400
- Well, it is what it is.

48:40.417 --> 48:42.752
- How does this thing
do off road?

48:42.754 --> 48:45.521
- I live in Chicago.
I don't know.

48:45.722 --> 48:48.257
- If we get the chance
i might need to drive.

48:48.525 --> 48:50.192
- Okay.

48:58.769 --> 49:00.503
- Shit.

49:00.505 --> 49:02.338
We need a bridge.

49:04.908 --> 49:07.176
Does it narrow?
Does it get any narrower?

49:07.178 --> 49:09.278
- I do not know what you're
trying to ask me right now.

49:09.280 --> 49:11.514
- Never mind,
just keep it steady.

49:11.516 --> 49:14.350
- I don't know what you
think I've been doing up here.

49:15.619 --> 49:17.954
- Does this back window open?

49:18.722 --> 49:20.790
- No.
What are you doing?

49:25.062 --> 49:27.797
- Is there anything identifying
you in this bag?

49:27.799 --> 49:29.665
- Uh, yeah, my stuff.

49:29.667 --> 49:32.702
- Anything sewn into the lining.
Anything like that?

49:32.704 --> 49:34.236
- I don't know.

49:34.238 --> 49:36.806
What are you--
what are you gonna do?

49:42.446 --> 49:44.413
Whoa, whoa, what the fuck!

49:44.415 --> 49:46.983
- They'll stop for it.
Keep driving.

49:51.922 --> 49:53.489
Speed up!

49:54.758 --> 49:57.727
And watch for the next car
you see coming towards us.

50:00.664 --> 50:02.598
As soon as you see it I want
you to pull into their Lane

50:02.600 --> 50:04.166
and stop immediately.

50:04.168 --> 50:06.402
- You want me to run
head first into another car?

50:06.404 --> 50:09.271
I want you to block their Lane.

50:09.273 --> 50:12.408
- If I can.
I'm not going to hit anybody.

50:33.630 --> 50:35.898
Alright, I think I see one.

50:35.900 --> 50:38.134
- Pull into their Lane.

50:43.473 --> 50:44.707
- Shit.

50:44.709 --> 50:46.742
Jesus Christ...

50:51.815 --> 50:53.582
- Come forward please!

50:53.584 --> 50:54.784
Let's go!

50:54.786 --> 50:57.053
Keep it to this side.
Let's go, let's go!

50:59.156 --> 51:00.089
Good.

51:00.091 --> 51:01.657
Cut it this way!
This way, ma'am.

51:01.659 --> 51:03.392
<i> Let's go. This way.</i>
<i> C'mon, c'mon!</i>

51:03.394 --> 51:05.094
<i> Go. Go. Go.</i>

51:06.496 --> 51:08.731
Ma'am, we have a situation
on the road up ahead.

51:08.733 --> 51:10.733
I need you to step out
of your vehicle.

51:10.735 --> 51:12.635
I need your keys ma'am.

51:13.270 --> 51:14.904
Thank you very much.

51:46.436 --> 51:48.370
- What are we doing?

51:48.372 --> 51:50.639
- I'm sorry
to get you into this.

51:50.641 --> 51:52.608
- Into what?

51:54.411 --> 51:57.146
- Debra, into what?
- Can you please
not say my name?

51:57.981 --> 51:59.782
- Look, it's my car,
alright?

51:59.784 --> 52:03.486
If you're in such peril that
i can't even say your name

52:03.488 --> 52:05.855
out loud in my car...

52:07.157 --> 52:09.125
Where does that put me?

52:09.127 --> 52:11.694
- I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

52:13.230 --> 52:15.664
For now at least
we're in this together.

52:15.666 --> 52:17.700
- In what?

52:19.069 --> 52:22.037
- What are we in?
- In this situation.

52:24.908 --> 52:26.175
- That's all that
you're gonna say.

52:26.177 --> 52:28.978
- That's all I really know.

52:31.448 --> 52:34.416
- Who are the people
who are following us?

52:34.418 --> 52:36.652
- I don't know.

52:38.188 --> 52:41.857
- You don't know, or you
don't trust me enough to say?

52:58.141 --> 52:59.542
- I don't.

53:01.011 --> 53:03.179
- I'm sorry.

53:07.050 --> 53:08.851
- Keep going.

53:08.853 --> 53:10.119
We can finally
get away from them.

53:10.121 --> 53:11.453
- Keep driving.
- Why?

53:11.455 --> 53:13.355
- Tell me why.

53:17.961 --> 53:20.196
- Please.

53:24.467 --> 53:26.268
- That's not good enough.

53:26.270 --> 53:27.803
- No.

53:27.805 --> 53:29.038
Leave me your keys!

53:29.040 --> 53:30.806
That way you can
tell them I stole your car!

53:30.808 --> 53:32.474
- You would be stealing my car.

53:38.582 --> 53:40.482
- No.

54:07.410 --> 54:10.613
- I need to report
a reckless driver, please.

54:11.014 --> 54:14.016
Yeah, I'm east of the 397.

54:14.018 --> 54:16.685
It's maybe kirk road?

54:16.687 --> 54:18.120
Huh?

54:20.390 --> 54:22.958
<i> Yeah, I don't know...</i>

58:46.689 --> 58:48.690
I'm sorry.

59:19.188 --> 59:20.656
- Five.

59:20.658 --> 59:22.491
Lowercase a.

59:22.493 --> 59:23.959
Nine.

Lowercase I.

59:25.729 --> 59:26.828

59:26.830 --> 59:28.597
Lowercase c.

59:28.599 --> 59:30.399

59:32.169 --> 59:33.735
Capital u.

59:34.938 --> 59:36.638
Lowercase a.

59:36.640 --> 59:38.307
Capital t.

59:38.309 --> 59:40.142
Capital g.

59:58.061 --> 59:59.428
Yep.

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:19.801
- You have to let me
call a lawyer.

01:02:19.803 --> 01:02:21.603
My name is Abe richek.

01:02:21.605 --> 01:02:24.005
I'm a journalist.
I work for...

01:02:24.007 --> 01:02:25.574
I work for the Chicago Mercury

01:02:25.576 --> 01:02:28.910
and you can call
my publisher to confirm that.

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:31.513
I have not committed a crime.

01:02:31.515 --> 01:02:33.014
I have not broken any laws.

01:02:33.016 --> 01:02:36.318
So, you need to charge me
with something or let me go.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.088
This is a blatant--

01:02:50.366 --> 01:02:52.367
I haven't done anything.

01:03:25.168 --> 01:03:28.136
- Tent caterpillars
hatch in June.

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.674
- What?

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:39.815
- Tent caterpillars in north
America hatch in early summer.

01:03:39.817 --> 01:03:43.084
Cherry trees blossom in march.

01:03:43.086 --> 01:03:45.654
- Who are you?

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:48.390
Mesmer?

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:50.992
Sgc?

01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:54.529
Ziki?

01:03:54.531 --> 01:03:57.399
Let me contact my supervisors.

01:03:57.401 --> 01:03:58.900
We can work this out.

01:03:58.902 --> 01:04:00.769
- It is worked out.

01:04:00.771 --> 01:04:02.337
I'm sorry.

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:04.840
- No! No! Wait!

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:15.410
Shit.
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

01:05:16.879 --> 01:05:18.179
Okay.

01:05:18.181 --> 01:05:20.615
Okay, okay.

01:05:46.909 --> 01:05:48.677
Okay.

01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:26.414
Fuck!

01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:28.750
Ah, shit.

01:06:34.256 --> 01:06:35.824
Um...

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:06.688
Okay, okay.

01:07:18.367 --> 01:07:20.402
Oh.

01:07:43.192 --> 01:07:45.126
Ah!

01:07:55.338 --> 01:07:57.105
Fuck.

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:07.582
Okay, okay.

01:14:14.249 --> 01:14:16.050
- Hey, stop the car.

01:14:16.052 --> 01:14:17.985
Pull over.

01:15:29.292 --> 01:15:31.726
You know,
i grew up around here.

01:15:34.496 --> 01:15:36.964
- Really?

01:15:36.966 --> 01:15:39.333
- On the other side
of the river in hermiston.

01:15:42.804 --> 01:15:44.639
- Things change much?

01:15:45.474 --> 01:15:47.208
- Some things.

01:15:48.477 --> 01:15:50.545
My old house is gone.

01:15:50.547 --> 01:15:52.980
New owners tore down.
Not sure why.

01:15:54.249 --> 01:15:57.818
Makes me think of this
one time I was a kid.

01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:01.889
I had this friend,
Todd moray.

01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:04.158
I remember his dad was always
out of work and on welfare,

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:06.327
but he had this job once,

01:16:06.329 --> 01:16:09.630
where he worked at this
place called Saxon shoes.

01:16:09.632 --> 01:16:11.098
It was a shoe store downtown

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:12.934
where they used to take
an X-ray of your foot

01:16:12.936 --> 01:16:15.670
to determine the shoe size.

01:16:15.672 --> 01:16:17.471
One summer Todd and i
are down by the creek

01:16:17.473 --> 01:16:20.241
next to the houses
where we lived.

01:16:20.243 --> 01:16:23.177
We found this pair
of box turtles.

01:16:23.179 --> 01:16:26.247
One was a little bit
lighter than the other.

01:16:26.249 --> 01:16:30.818
And Todd had the idea that
we'd take these things as pets.

01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:32.420
Which meant we had
to choose our favorites.

01:16:32.422 --> 01:16:35.289
And I remember Todd ran for
the bigger, darker one,

01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:38.259
which we assumed was male.

01:16:38.261 --> 01:16:40.528
And I got the smaller,
lighter one,

01:16:40.530 --> 01:16:43.698
which we assumed was female.

01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:48.803
He called his boxo
and I called mine boxie.

01:16:48.805 --> 01:16:51.539
Later that day we
took out our pocket knives

01:16:51.541 --> 01:16:55.509
and carved markings
into their backs.

01:16:55.511 --> 01:17:01.282
He carved out an o
and I carved out an x.

01:17:01.284 --> 01:17:03.217
It wasn't even
to tell 'em apart.

01:17:03.219 --> 01:17:06.187
I mean, it was easy because
of the color of their shell.

01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:11.292
This was to tell the universe
that they were ours.

01:17:12.894 --> 01:17:17.365
So we built them these,
these big cardboard houses

01:17:17.367 --> 01:17:21.969
that we stuffed full of mulch
and dirt and grass clippings.

01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:26.073
And we fed them
caterpillars and slugs,

01:17:26.075 --> 01:17:28.209
and lettuce and carrots.

01:17:28.211 --> 01:17:30.578
And when we could
we'd meet at this common area

01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:32.079
in between our rows of houses

01:17:32.081 --> 01:17:34.715
and takes them
for walks on leashes.

01:17:34.717 --> 01:17:35.983
But it was never very orderly

01:17:35.985 --> 01:17:37.585
because one of them
would go straight

01:17:37.587 --> 01:17:40.054
and the other one
would walk in a circle.

01:17:40.056 --> 01:17:42.723
Or vice versa.

01:17:42.725 --> 01:17:44.659
By the end of the summer
my parents told me

01:17:44.661 --> 01:17:46.994
I had to get rid of my turtle.

01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:50.931
To them it wasn't a pet,
it was a wild animal.

01:17:50.933 --> 01:17:53.067
But I'd really grown
to like the thing.

01:17:53.069 --> 01:17:55.102
I'm sure boxie didn't
feel the same way about it,

01:17:55.104 --> 01:17:56.270
but I was eight.

01:17:56.272 --> 01:17:57.738
It's a selfish age.

01:17:57.740 --> 01:17:59.740
So my parents set a deadline.

01:17:59.742 --> 01:18:02.777
I had to get rid of the turtle
the day before school.

01:18:02.779 --> 01:18:06.614
And I remember I waited
'til the very last second.

01:18:06.616 --> 01:18:09.116
On labor day.

01:18:11.119 --> 01:18:13.054
There were dark clouds
in the sky

01:18:13.056 --> 01:18:14.622
and you could feel
the pressure dropping

01:18:14.624 --> 01:18:16.757
right before a big storm.

01:18:16.759 --> 01:18:20.461
But my dad was insistent.

01:18:20.463 --> 01:18:24.298
So I took boxie out to the
creek where I found her,

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:26.801
and I let her go.

01:18:26.803 --> 01:18:28.969
And every time Todd and I would
go back there we'd look for her

01:18:28.971 --> 01:18:32.273
but I never found her.

01:18:32.275 --> 01:18:34.875
Figured the storm got her.

01:18:37.012 --> 01:18:39.380
Then after summer it was fall.

01:18:39.382 --> 01:18:43.150
And after fall,
of course, winter.

01:18:43.152 --> 01:18:46.754
And boxo, Todd's turtle
goes into hibernation.

01:18:46.756 --> 01:18:52.093
But that February we had
this unseasonable warm,

01:18:52.095 --> 01:18:54.662
and the temperatures
got up to about 70.

01:18:54.664 --> 01:18:57.832
And everyone's outside
in their t-shirts,

01:18:57.834 --> 01:19:03.003
and all of sudden boxo
comes out of hibernation.

01:19:03.005 --> 01:19:05.806
And Todd's out there
taking him for walks,

01:19:05.808 --> 01:19:08.075
and I'm jealous.

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:10.277
But then sun goes away.

01:19:11.379 --> 01:19:14.982
The warm spell ends
and it's winter again.

01:19:14.984 --> 01:19:18.185
Boxo can't go back
into hibernation.

01:19:18.187 --> 01:19:21.255
So after a few days,
he dies.

01:21:39.527 --> 01:21:41.462
- So is that it?

01:21:43.598 --> 01:21:45.466
- Basically.

01:21:47.068 --> 01:21:49.837
Two turtles found,
two turtles dead.

01:21:51.273 --> 01:21:53.407
Then a few years ago I'm
back there with my little girl

01:21:53.409 --> 01:21:56.143
and I'm showing her
the old neighborhood.

01:21:56.145 --> 01:22:00.314
Introducing her to a few of my
relatives that are still around.

01:22:00.316 --> 01:22:01.615
And it's hot,
cuz it's summer,

01:22:01.617 --> 01:22:04.685
so I take her down
to the old creek.

01:22:04.687 --> 01:22:06.787
And she's picking dandelions
and running around,

01:22:06.789 --> 01:22:10.090
and she says "hey, dad,
look there's a turtle."

01:22:12.294 --> 01:22:15.663
So, I go down there
and sure enough

01:22:15.665 --> 01:22:20.267
there's a turtle with a clumsy
x scrawled into its back.

01:22:24.039 --> 01:22:27.875
Like it had just been
waiting there for me.

01:22:27.877 --> 01:22:30.444
Like time had
just stood still...

01:22:33.415 --> 01:22:35.349
- Hmm.

01:22:35.351 --> 01:22:37.518
- You never can tell.

01:22:40.422 --> 01:22:41.555
- Here you go.

01:22:41.557 --> 01:22:43.057
- Thanks.

01:22:43.059 --> 01:22:44.224
- Take car.

01:22:44.226 --> 01:22:46.460
- Yeah.
You too.
