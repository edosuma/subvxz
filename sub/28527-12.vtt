00:08.133 --> 00:10.593
<i>Another beautiful day</i>
<i>in New Seattle.</i>

00:10.677 --> 00:13.763
<i>Shame the terminally ill</i>
<i>kidnapping victims can't go sightseeing.</i>

00:13.847 --> 00:17.559
Help yourselves to scrambled eggs.
Red bowl with brains, green bowl without.

00:17.642 --> 00:20.603
<i>No classes today, kids.</i>
<i>That tutor you all loved?</i>

00:20.812 --> 00:24.524
<i>He was lying to us and helped with a plan</i>
<i>to spread zombie-ism outside the wall.</i>

00:24.607 --> 00:26.609
<i>Yes, my long-lost dad, the drug addict</i>

00:26.693 --> 00:29.112
<i>who accidentally created zombies</i>
<i>was one of the masterminds,</i>

00:29.195 --> 00:32.490
<i>but he had a change of heart</i>
<i>right before I watched him get killed.</i>

00:33.324 --> 00:35.994
-Thanks. I'm good.

00:36.077 --> 00:39.706
<i>Radical humans want zombies dead,</i>
<i>radical zombies want humans dead.</i>

00:40.040 --> 00:42.959
<i>There's still a threat</i>
<i>we'll all be nuked and oh, yeah, </i>

00:43.042 --> 00:44.502
<i>the city is running out of brains.</i>

00:45.545 --> 00:47.130
-Yup.

00:49.090 --> 00:52.886
<i>I want to lay down right here</i>
<i>in this very spot, and never move.</i>

00:53.428 --> 00:56.389
<i>But I won't. The cure is coming.</i>

00:56.473 --> 00:58.933
<i>I have to believe that everything</i>
<i>is going to be okay.</i>

00:59.017 --> 01:00.268
<i>Because what's the alternative?</i>

01:04.814 --> 01:07.275
Well, isn't that just beautiful.

01:07.358 --> 01:09.360
<i>You are a true hero, General Mills.</i>

01:09.444 --> 01:11.780
I've given you the tools, Ms. Durkins.

01:11.863 --> 01:13.656
Now it's up to you to use them.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.201
<i>It's time to annihilate those monsters.</i>

01:16.284 --> 01:18.328
Don't mind if I do.

01:53.863 --> 01:56.783
Looks like someone's got his monthlies.
Feeling a little crabby?

01:56.866 --> 01:59.536
Charli called. The cure isn't coming.

02:00.203 --> 02:03.873
What? What're you talking about,
we sent her the tainted Utopium.

02:03.957 --> 02:08.086
Saxon's been working
with this big pharma company, MediVec.

02:08.419 --> 02:11.631
And apparently, instead of making a cure,
they realized there's more money

02:11.714 --> 02:14.509
to be made in some kind
of chronic treatment.

02:16.553 --> 02:17.595
Saxon sold out.

02:17.679 --> 02:18.680
He can't do that.

02:18.763 --> 02:21.015
I gave them the tainted Utopium.
He has total control.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.600
Can't Charli just get it back?

02:23.143 --> 02:24.519
Saxon kicked her off the project.

02:24.602 --> 02:27.272
What he's doing isn't exactly
on the up-and-up with the CDC.

02:27.772 --> 02:31.317
And he knows, if I got
the formula for the tainted Utopium,

02:31.401 --> 02:32.861
I could make the cure myself,

02:32.944 --> 02:35.530
so he moved the project
to a high-security building.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.073
She can't get access.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.993
They haven't even figured out
the treatment protocol yet.

02:40.410 --> 02:41.995
It could be months before it's ready.

02:43.538 --> 02:44.622
We can't wait months.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.291
Don't they understand
what's happening here?

02:46.374 --> 02:48.084
They don't care!

02:48.167 --> 02:49.252
They could just cure everyone now.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.921
They could just cure everyone
and all this would be over.

02:52.005 --> 02:56.217
Are you not listening to me?
It is out of our hands! It is over.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.720
-I screwed up, I trusted the wrong--
-No.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.890
If Charli can't get us the formula,
we get it ourselves.

03:03.391 --> 03:04.225
We'll get it?

03:05.101 --> 03:05.977
Someone has to.

03:06.603 --> 03:11.357
What, so, uh, you want to leave Seattle,
travel undetected to Atlanta,

03:11.441 --> 03:13.401
break into a high-security building
and steal the formula?

03:13.484 --> 03:15.570
I am done being screwed over
and lied to.

03:15.653 --> 03:18.990
I'm done watching people
I care about get killed.

03:19.073 --> 03:20.909
We keep fighting,
and trying to fix things

03:20.992 --> 03:23.286
and it's always two steps forward,
40 back,

03:23.369 --> 03:24.329
and I'm done with it.

03:24.412 --> 03:26.623
I want this over on our terms.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.709
This doesn't end with Saxon
and some company

03:29.792 --> 03:31.419
profiting from zombie-ism.

03:32.170 --> 03:35.548
It ends with us saving Seattle
and getting our lives back.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.471
Okay.

03:43.973 --> 03:46.601
We need to know everything
there is to know about this building.

03:46.684 --> 03:50.021
<i>It's called "Zone 19."</i>
<i>I know they have retinal scans.</i>

03:50.104 --> 03:52.398
<i>-When we started working with MediVec,</i>

03:52.523 --> 03:55.026
<i>Gladys from HR had us all do a scan,</i>

03:55.109 --> 03:57.820
<i>but I got booted off the project</i>
<i>before I ever went inside. </i>

03:57.904 --> 03:59.322
They have retinal scans, Liv.

03:59.405 --> 04:00.990
I cut off a dead guy's hand once

04:01.074 --> 04:02.909
for fingerprint access
to a secret lab elevator.

04:02.992 --> 04:06.287
Well, Major cut it off,
but I carried it around on my belt.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.539
I'm not backing away
from a retinal scan.

04:09.290 --> 04:12.752
<i>I do know a janitor who works</i>
<i>in Zone 19. Darrell.</i>

04:12.835 --> 04:15.546
<i>I don't really know him,</i>
<i>he's just always super flirty with me </i>

04:15.630 --> 04:16.673
<i>even though he's married. </i>

04:16.756 --> 04:20.009
This is good. Flirty Zone 19 Janitor
who likes you is good.

04:20.093 --> 04:24.097
You could, like, subtly pump him
for inside information.

04:24.180 --> 04:28.810
<i>Oh, I've tried. The only scoop I got</i>
<i>is that there's a racist security guard </i>

04:28.893 --> 04:30.979
<i>who thinks Darrell</i>
<i>and the other black janitor </i>

04:31.062 --> 04:32.146
<i>are the same guy,</i>

04:32.230 --> 04:33.439
<i>and he calls them both "Chief."</i>

04:33.523 --> 04:35.525
<i>I'm not really great with, I guess...</i>

04:36.609 --> 04:37.443
<i>Men.</i>

04:38.653 --> 04:40.905
We can do a Cyrano thing,
with like an earbud,

04:40.989 --> 04:43.157
and you can help her
seduce the information out of him.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.243
Or maybe while he's chatting her up,

04:45.326 --> 04:48.037
she can plant like a GoPro
on his mop bucket or something.

04:48.871 --> 04:50.957
-To get video of Zone 19.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.041
So we can see the layout.

04:52.750 --> 04:53.668
That's what you're pitching?

04:54.085 --> 04:55.795
You're confident
we'll get through a retinal scan

04:55.878 --> 04:57.380
and that's what you're pitching?

04:57.463 --> 05:00.258
We're brainstorming.
There are some good ideas.

05:00.341 --> 05:02.302
-Like the one I had.
-And some not so good ideas.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.470
-Yours.
-Which inspire better ideas.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.306
Oh, my God. Spy pen.

05:08.891 --> 05:12.353
Mmm. Looks like you need a key card
to get in this part as well.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.481
Stop chatting to the buxom
lab tech, Darrell,

05:15.565 --> 05:16.941
and show us more security measures.

05:18.234 --> 05:21.195
Kudos to Charli for planting
that spy pen so quickly.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.906
And for me for having great ideas.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.994
I guess he's in the janitor's closet now.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.329
Oh, the lab tech's in there. What, is he hugging her?

05:32.582 --> 05:34.959
Looks like.
Oh, he pushed her away.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.461
Now he's hugging her again.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.087
And pushing her away.

05:38.963 --> 05:40.673
Back in for a hug.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.759
Out with a... Oh, my God.

05:42.842 --> 05:43.843
Is he...

05:45.053 --> 05:49.223
Oh. That thrusting spy pen
is making me a bit motion-sick.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.893
I guess this footage
isn't all that helpful.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.687
Wait. Didn't Charli say
he was married?

06:01.069 --> 06:02.653
They have the cure,
but they're not sending it?

06:03.529 --> 06:05.490
-It's sort of coming.

06:05.573 --> 06:08.034
We're going to Atlanta
to break into the CDC and get it.

06:08.284 --> 06:11.370
Well, we are breaking in
to get the formula for tainted Utopium.

06:11.454 --> 06:12.830
Which is the only ingredient
we're missing.

06:12.914 --> 06:15.875
The formula is on
a thumb drive, in a vault,

06:16.250 --> 06:19.504
in a high-security satellite building
called Zone 19.

06:19.587 --> 06:22.256
We were able to get some
inside information from my friend Charli.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.967
Then we kind of blackmailed
a philandering janitor

06:25.051 --> 06:26.385
into giving us the full scoop.

06:26.469 --> 06:27.762
Here's what we know so far.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.597
Relax, Major.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.266
It's much worse than you think.

06:32.642 --> 06:36.104
<i>The formula is in a vault</i>
<i>that only Dr. Saxon has access to.</i>

06:36.187 --> 06:37.688
<i>To even get into that room, </i>

06:37.772 --> 06:40.358
<i>you have to pass through</i>
<i>a series of security checks.</i>

06:40.441 --> 06:42.735
<i>The first is a key card</i>
<i>which can't be copied,</i>

06:42.819 --> 06:45.196
<i>and if it's lost,</i>
<i>the entire system will be reset.</i>

06:45.279 --> 06:47.657
<i>His photo comes up</i>
<i>on the security cam.</i>

06:47.740 --> 06:49.784
<i>This only gets him into the outer room.</i>

06:49.867 --> 06:52.370
<i>Next, he has to pass more security cameras</i>

06:52.453 --> 06:54.872
<i>to get to the second</i>
<i>of three checkpoints,</i>

06:55.123 --> 06:57.166
<i>where he has to pass a retinal scan.</i>

06:57.250 --> 07:01.504
<i>And this leads him to a vault</i>
<i>that only Saxon can access.</i>

07:01.587 --> 07:03.923
<i>We have no way of knowing</i>
<i>how he accesses it. </i>

07:04.006 --> 07:08.094
<i>We suspect it's by DNA,</i>
<i>possibly from saliva, could be from blood.</i>

07:08.177 --> 07:10.888
<i>If any one of these systems is set off, </i>

07:10.972 --> 07:12.181
<i>it will activate a lockdown.</i>

07:14.559 --> 07:17.311
Quick question. Is any of that true,

07:17.395 --> 07:19.105
or are you just doing
the Tom Cruise monologue

07:19.188 --> 07:21.232
from <i>Mission Impossible 1</i>
for your own amusement?

07:22.650 --> 07:23.484
Both.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.319
Are you guys actually thinking
you're going to do this?

07:25.403 --> 07:26.612
We're going to do this.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.073
We just need some help planning it.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.533
That's where you guys come in.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.994
Clive, you must know something
about security systems, right?

07:33.411 --> 07:35.496
And, Major, you have special ops training.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.123
Not to mention cool military gadgets.

07:37.206 --> 07:39.041
You're here to poke holes
in everyone's ideas.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.877
Make sure we're not
doing anything stupid.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.254
Oh, okay. Well, then let me
start by noting that

07:43.337 --> 07:45.756
you are talking about a major heist.

07:46.090 --> 07:49.927
Yeah, you'd need an <i>Ocean's Eleven</i>
style team of highly skilled criminals

07:50.011 --> 07:51.137
-to pull this job off.
-Yes.

07:51.220 --> 07:53.097
Yeah, at least some kind
of hacker genius,

07:53.181 --> 07:55.725
and there's always the con man,
the safe-cracker.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.894
The pickpocket, the computer guy.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.812
You guys aren't highly skilled criminals.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.732
No. We're not. We're zombies.

08:03.941 --> 08:06.110
We don't need <i>Ocean's Eleven</i>
to do this job.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.779
We just need the right brains.

08:20.124 --> 08:21.876
Clearly <i>American Ninja Warrior</i> brain.

08:21.959 --> 08:24.337
We basically have to do
a high-wire obstacle course

08:24.420 --> 08:26.047
through the labs of Zone 19.

08:26.422 --> 08:28.424
On Ninja Warrior,
we'll be able to climb walls.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.760
I'm just saying Cirque du Soleil
is a bit more stealthy.

08:31.135 --> 08:32.720
We have to climb without being seen.

08:32.803 --> 08:35.264
We don't know what role they had.
They could've been a mime.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.141
Can I ask you a question
about the menu?

08:40.019 --> 08:43.981
The Cirque du Soleil acrobat
is an actual acrobat, right?

08:44.565 --> 08:46.234
That's what it says on the menu.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.654
Do you know what show they were from?

08:51.197 --> 08:53.533
They had a starring role in <i>O,</i>
they only ate grass-fed beef

08:53.616 --> 08:55.326
and they died peacefully in their sleep.

08:55.409 --> 08:57.537
We should just get both. Let's get both.

08:59.247 --> 09:04.585
We'll have the ninja and acrobat to go,
just cold, no sauce or anything.

09:05.294 --> 09:06.587
Classy.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.383
Acrobat brain, huh?

09:11.759 --> 09:13.010
New man in your life?

09:15.179 --> 09:16.597
I'll take that glare as a no.

09:18.099 --> 09:21.936
It's probably for the best. You're not
that great with boyfriends, are you?

09:22.019 --> 09:26.065
Speaking of acrobats, though,
how's Peyton?

09:29.610 --> 09:30.945
Madly in love with me.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.949
You should probably try
to get over her at some point.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.661
It's a good cover, Doc.
I almost bought that.

09:39.245 --> 09:42.873
Oh, that? That was genuine cockiness,

09:42.957 --> 09:47.461
because, um, I am going to spend
the rest of my life with Peyton Charles.

09:47.920 --> 09:52.508
And you're probably going to spend
the rest of yours with him.

09:54.969 --> 09:57.888
Bon appa-don't let the door hit you
in the ass on the way out.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.434
Keep the change.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.771
His hair makes me so angry.

10:08.482 --> 10:10.151
Oh, Major gave us these earbud things

10:10.234 --> 10:12.320
so we can talk to each other
<i>Mission Impossible </i>style.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.948
Voice-activated
throat microphones.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.659
-Hey!
-Hey.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.662
I went to see the manager at Le Dome.

10:21.871 --> 10:25.416
In exchange for the remoulade recipe,
he hooked me up with an off-menu brain.

10:25.708 --> 10:26.542
Russian hacker.

10:27.001 --> 10:30.588
Well, I've got some more off-menu items.

10:31.589 --> 10:34.634
"John Amato, grand theft auto, deceased.

10:35.343 --> 10:38.512
Liam Monteaux, grand theft auto
and larceny, deceased."

10:38.596 --> 10:41.390
They're all buried inside the wall.
I don't know if this is true,

10:41.474 --> 10:44.685
but Google said brains last up
to ten years if the body is embalmed

10:44.769 --> 10:47.271
and in a coffin. The real get
is Angelo De Marco.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.065
Pickpocket, con man, petty thief.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.525
Rumor was he could take
the diamond out of an earring

10:51.609 --> 10:52.735
without removing the earring.

10:52.818 --> 10:55.363
The rotting brain
of a dead pickpocket.

10:55.446 --> 10:57.990
This is the nicest thing
anyone has ever given me.

10:58.783 --> 10:59.617
Um...

11:00.576 --> 11:02.411
I wish I could do more. Oh, I arrested Liam Monteaux once,

11:06.332 --> 11:09.543
so if you use him, get ready for visions
of me rocking a mustache.

11:10.836 --> 11:11.962
Yeah.

11:14.215 --> 11:18.928
-Yeah. Road trip.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.850
So, I guess, I'll see you guys.

11:25.893 --> 11:29.563
You know, when we get back with the cure,
there goes your zombie partner.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.319
What're you gonna do without me?

11:39.156 --> 11:39.990
I don't know.

12:04.390 --> 12:07.143
Was that a, uh, "I'm sorry,
you're gonna die" hug?

12:07.518 --> 12:09.812
I think he was crying a little.

12:10.312 --> 12:12.648
You haven't seen
the last of us, Clive Babineaux.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.776
We hope.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.782
Great. Bubba.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.452
Bringing me the name of the miscreant
who took my valuable Freylich children.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.203
I don't have a name.

12:26.287 --> 12:29.290
Then please see this carrot chopping
as the thinly veiled threat it is,

12:29.373 --> 12:31.333
and turn around,
and go and get me the name of--

12:31.417 --> 12:33.294
-I got a picture.
-Okay.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.129
Moving in the right direction.

12:35.713 --> 12:38.632
Warehouse next door to where
they got snatched had some cameras.

12:38.716 --> 12:40.843
I got a hold of the footage and saw this.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.636
I mean, it's kind of fuzzy, but...

12:43.429 --> 12:44.638
Ravi Chakrabarti.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.142
He works for the city morgue.

12:48.642 --> 12:53.898
Find him, follow him,
and once you have the kids, kill him.

13:16.462 --> 13:19.215
I'm really glad we're at this place
in our relationship

13:19.548 --> 13:21.634
where we can dig up graves together
without having to talk.

13:21.717 --> 13:23.260
We are easy like Sunday morning.

13:23.802 --> 13:25.888
Let's take a moment to honor
how far we've come.

13:26.597 --> 13:29.099
From fresh-faced kids
picking out China patterns,

13:29.183 --> 13:32.144
to zombie exes grave-robbing felon brains.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.606
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

13:38.692 --> 13:40.444
I don't think Clive thinks
we're making it back.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.238
He's just nervous.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.447
He doesn't want to see you get hurt.

13:43.614 --> 13:44.573
Isn't that your thing?

13:45.533 --> 13:46.992
Hey, you're not itching
for me to get hurt?

13:47.076 --> 13:49.161
-Of course not.
-Exactly.

13:53.249 --> 13:56.502
I know that what Ravi and I
are doing is crazy, but...

13:57.836 --> 13:58.712
We have to try.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.923
You have to do more than try, Liv.

14:01.382 --> 14:04.969
You have to succeed.
Fate of the world and all that.

14:05.386 --> 14:08.597
Yeah. Sorry,

14:09.181 --> 14:12.351
I guess I'm kind of waiting
to get hit over the head with that shovel,

14:12.434 --> 14:16.397
and wake up duct-taped to a chair
in your basement "for my own good."

14:16.647 --> 14:19.650
-One time. I kidnapped you one time.

14:19.733 --> 14:22.319
Lest we not forget, you turned me
into a zombie to save my life.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.363
And you stop bitching about it never.

14:28.409 --> 14:32.454
All right, let's just say
that, um, we've both done

14:32.663 --> 14:35.583
a lot of well-intentioned crap
to each other, but...

14:36.709 --> 14:38.377
Here we are.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.546
Still here.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.927
Let this be our official restart.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.805
Sounds good.

14:49.889 --> 14:53.475
A fresh start before I head off
to meet my untimely end.

14:54.435 --> 14:56.520
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you were nervous.

14:58.564 --> 15:03.319
I'm not. I feel much safer
knowing that you're going to do this.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.405
Think of all the things you've done.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.075
-Your alias is frickin' "Renegade."

15:10.993 --> 15:12.703
You are a badass.

15:17.249 --> 15:18.292
You got this.

15:48.197 --> 15:50.532
I went to see Michelle
and baby Jacob today.

15:52.159 --> 15:53.077
That's nice.

15:55.245 --> 15:58.832
Deadbeat Shane still
hasn't even called to ask after his son.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.379
Sweaty Steve.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.298
Excuse me?

16:06.382 --> 16:07.675
Steve Reinhardt.

16:07.758 --> 16:10.302
I arrested him
for involuntary manslaughter,

16:10.386 --> 16:12.179
but he'd done time for robbing banks.

16:12.262 --> 16:15.557
So, he's not great at bank robbing,
'cause he got caught.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.893
Yeah... good point.

16:17.977 --> 16:18.894
Yeah...

16:19.186 --> 16:21.522
I'm not 100% sure he's dead.

16:22.940 --> 16:27.695
So, I gave them what I could find,
but... that's not the main guy, you know?

16:28.237 --> 16:30.197
I mean, they need the Clooney.

16:30.614 --> 16:33.242
What's <i>Ocean's Eleven</i>
without George Clooney?

16:34.410 --> 16:35.869
<i>Ocean's Ten</i> with Brad Pitt.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.165
Can I please tell you
what the real problem is?

16:41.834 --> 16:43.585
You're the Clooney.

16:44.503 --> 16:45.921
Dale, I'm not--

16:46.005 --> 16:47.840
They're not robbing casinos.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.969
They're going to get
the cure for zombie-ism.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.848
We're having a baby in a few weeks.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.644
Can you please go out and make sure
that the world is safe for her?

17:01.937 --> 17:02.938
I can't leave you--

17:03.022 --> 17:05.733
Is there any part of you that isn't sure
that I can take care of myself?

17:06.900 --> 17:08.110
No.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.455
So, go save the world.

17:25.836 --> 17:27.796
Look, I'll come by at least twice a day.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.174
Let them outside to go pee,
fill up their water bowls.

17:30.257 --> 17:32.968
Can we be serious for a second?
If something happens to me--

17:33.052 --> 17:36.305
Yeah, I'll be curled up in a ball
on the floor and useful to no one, so...

17:37.389 --> 17:39.683
Don't let anything happen. Okay?

17:41.894 --> 17:43.145
Take care of Ravi, please.

17:44.938 --> 17:46.398
I'm probably gonna marry the guy.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.405
Well, now I know your ass is coming back.

17:53.489 --> 17:54.782
Damn right, it is.

18:00.329 --> 18:03.207
I thought Major was kidding
about coming out through a closet.

18:03.749 --> 18:04.792
What are you doing here?

18:07.669 --> 18:10.380
I figured if you're gonna eat
a bunch of criminals,

18:10.464 --> 18:12.716
you should have some law enforcement
with you.

18:14.218 --> 18:16.845
And it'll give me
one last hurrah with my partner.

18:17.262 --> 18:18.347
Sss. Partners.

18:28.899 --> 18:30.818
It's not like I'm against us
lurking around

18:30.901 --> 18:33.529
and watching Peyton Charles, but why?

18:34.822 --> 18:37.950
It's been three days,
and no one's seen Chakrabarti.

18:38.033 --> 18:39.993
Not at work, not at home.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.538
So, I figure
we follow his favorite thing,

18:42.621 --> 18:43.831
and maybe she'll lead us to him.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.999
I can't believe
she bought Time 4 Tacos.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.001
Darcy loved Time 4 Taco.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.505
Looks like she's not the only one.

18:52.673 --> 18:53.674
Here's what I don't get.

18:53.757 --> 18:56.635
How in the hell did
the Ricky-Gervais-face-making knob

18:56.718 --> 18:57.970
bag a woman like that?

18:59.138 --> 19:02.307
The guy ain't rich. He's barely a doctor.

19:02.391 --> 19:05.227
Yeah, the hair, whatever,
and I guess the accent.

19:06.728 --> 19:08.438
But I do have to say...

19:10.023 --> 19:12.109
the sweater and the cords thing
sometimes works for him.

19:17.197 --> 19:18.240
I don't get it.

19:19.491 --> 19:22.494
That door leads directly into this bay.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.289
There are no other doors in or out,

19:26.039 --> 19:27.207
but she's gone.

19:29.710 --> 19:30.711
Okay.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.213
Where'd she go?

19:34.590 --> 19:36.216
<i>It was supposed to be</i>
<i>a moment of healing,</i>

19:36.300 --> 19:37.551
<i>but violence erupted</i>

19:37.634 --> 19:40.137
<i>as zombie and human friends</i>
<i>of Sloane Mills</i>

19:40.220 --> 19:41.430
<i>gathered to pay their respects.</i>

19:41.513 --> 19:43.724
A memorial for a zombie
who killed a bunch of humans

19:43.807 --> 19:45.767
didn't seem like an opportunity
to unite everyone.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.477
When I told you to send a security detail,

19:47.561 --> 19:50.272
I thought maybe there'd be some protests.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.816
Yes, it went a bit further than that.

19:52.900 --> 19:53.942
Do we know who's responsible?

19:54.026 --> 19:55.485
Looks like it was Dead Enders.

19:55.569 --> 19:58.405
They came in shooting
with full auto weapons.

19:58.488 --> 20:00.407
Our guys didn't stand a chance.

20:00.532 --> 20:01.617
Any survivors?

20:02.326 --> 20:03.952
No. I'm afraid not, sir.

20:06.788 --> 20:08.707
Where the hell did they get
that kind of firepower?

20:10.417 --> 20:11.418
Sir.

20:11.501 --> 20:14.046
We're getting reports
of zombies rioting in the streets.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.672
-Windows broken at Warmbloods.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.674
Perfect. Just what they wanted.

20:19.259 --> 20:21.220
I want everyone geared up.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.138
I want a team on the scene,
securing order,

20:23.222 --> 20:24.264
and I want to double our patrols.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.183
They want to start a war.

20:26.266 --> 20:27.809
Let's not give them the satisfaction.

20:30.103 --> 20:32.814
Okay, Hot-lanta. Let's do this.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.900
-Our target, Gladys Tinkerton.

20:34.983 --> 20:38.028
Head of HR for the CDC,
who Charli describes as "mousey."

20:38.654 --> 20:42.115
I'll lift her keycard and get it to Ravi,
who will access her office computer

20:42.199 --> 20:44.993
and switch Charli's retinal scan
to read as Saxon's.

20:45.452 --> 20:48.914
All you got to do is keep her occupied
and out of her purse till he gets it back.

20:48.997 --> 20:49.957
Got it?

20:50.040 --> 20:52.167
Yeah, I'm the Clooney. I got it.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.377
What a bunch of chumps.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.546
Oh! My God. I'm so sorry.

20:57.381 --> 20:58.257
Hmm.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.761
Okay, first order of business.

21:02.844 --> 21:04.137
-Find the bar.
-Find Gladys.

21:05.597 --> 21:08.433
I need you to focus on the task at hand.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.560
You know how many tasks
I can focus on at once?

21:10.644 --> 21:15.274
I clocked Gladys when I walked in,
while pinching two wallets and this watch.

21:15.816 --> 21:18.235
Is that... my watch?

21:18.318 --> 21:19.903
Worry about your own focus.

21:20.028 --> 21:23.115
As I was saying,
first order of business, bar.

21:23.198 --> 21:24.283
Then I need eyes on me.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.493
Once I fan the mark,
I'll tug my dress strap.

21:26.576 --> 21:29.204
Left strap means leather in the pit.
Right strap, the prat.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.623
Both straps, I'm legit adjusting my dress.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.042
I can dip without a stall
if you'd rather be my runner,

21:34.126 --> 21:37.004
but if I'm working single,
I'll need to find a spot to dump my poke

21:37.087 --> 21:39.006
'cause I can't fit much more in this bra.

21:39.089 --> 21:42.592
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
I haven't even had a drink yet.

21:44.553 --> 21:45.887
Seriously, bar, now.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.764
Can we please find Gladys?

21:47.848 --> 21:49.349
What did it look like I was just doing?

21:49.433 --> 21:51.059
Hang on to these for a second.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.395
Is this... When did you--

21:53.478 --> 21:55.981
Can you hang on to this for me?
It's pinching me like crazy.

21:56.064 --> 21:57.441
What're you...

21:58.567 --> 22:00.610
We are in the South now.

22:01.278 --> 22:04.114
You don't put stolen jewelry
in a black man's pocket.

22:04.906 --> 22:06.199
It's not in your pocket.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.039
You just made a terrible mistake.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.297
You can't leave her alone.

22:20.380 --> 22:23.592
If she checks her purse, sees she's
missing her phone and key, we're beat.

22:23.675 --> 22:26.386
I need you on her
like bald on a bowling ball.

22:33.810 --> 22:35.687
[loud electronic music
playing on radio]

22:38.398 --> 22:39.775
How about parking closer?

22:39.858 --> 22:42.611
You should be faster
and have longer legs.

22:42.694 --> 22:44.279
How long will the download take?

22:44.362 --> 22:47.282
It will take as long as it takes.

22:49.868 --> 22:52.120
Do me a favor? Hang on to this for me.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.539
Before the boy scout
makes me return everything.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.416
I'll split 80-20 for your silence.

22:56.500 --> 22:57.667
Fifty-fifty.

22:57.751 --> 22:59.086
-Seventy-thirty.

22:59.169 --> 23:00.962
I drive away now and give you nothing.

23:01.922 --> 23:03.673
Fine, 50-50.

23:04.132 --> 23:05.050
Pfft.

23:05.842 --> 23:07.302
You better be careful on this brain.

23:07.385 --> 23:09.471
Your attitude
will blow this whole operation.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.056
Pfft.

23:12.474 --> 23:14.976
Another "pfft" from you
and we're gonna tussle.

23:25.946 --> 23:30.283
So, Aaron, Jones, Maddux,
Glavine and Smoltz.

23:30.367 --> 23:33.328
Are all your cats
named after Atlanta Braves?

23:34.496 --> 23:35.705
I can't believe you got that.

23:35.789 --> 23:37.249
Of course I got that.

23:37.332 --> 23:38.500
Do people not get that?

23:38.583 --> 23:39.417
No.

23:39.584 --> 23:40.460
Um...

23:40.836 --> 23:42.546
Do you want to see pictures of them?
I can--

23:42.629 --> 23:43.588
No.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.716
-Oh, okay.
-I mean, of course I do.

23:46.800 --> 23:47.968
I love pictures of cats,

23:48.051 --> 23:52.013
but... I'm really amazing at guessing
what pets look like

23:52.097 --> 23:53.431
by their names.

23:53.723 --> 23:55.600
Yeah, it's a weird talent.

23:55.684 --> 23:58.895
Well, I love weird talents.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.773
-Tell me more.
-Okay. Um...

24:02.315 --> 24:04.985
Aaron is an orange tabby.

24:06.736 --> 24:08.697
Oh, my God.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.158
You are a man after my own heart.

24:12.075 --> 24:15.162
You watch <i>The Great British Bake Off.</i>
You like cats.

24:15.912 --> 24:16.997
You've got that ass on you.

24:19.124 --> 24:20.458
I'd climb you like a mountain.

24:21.376 --> 24:22.961
Oh. Well, that's...

24:23.044 --> 24:24.462
-Um...
-I should go.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.089
-No!

24:26.173 --> 24:27.174
Stay.

24:28.633 --> 24:31.303
You have to let me guess
the rest of your cats.

24:32.596 --> 24:36.725
Oh, I could just curl up in your lap
and purr.

24:39.561 --> 24:40.854
But I should go, right?

24:41.271 --> 24:42.147
I should go?

24:42.230 --> 24:43.315
-The purring thing was too much--
-No!

24:43.648 --> 24:44.858
Purring is fine.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.194
Who doesn't like purring?

24:47.986 --> 24:51.573
Well, actually, I am really a growler.

24:51.698 --> 24:54.159
-Ooh.

24:54.242 --> 24:56.870
-Ooh.

24:57.829 --> 25:00.916
Do you wanna get out of here?

25:02.918 --> 25:04.169
Uh, you know what?

25:05.587 --> 25:06.963
I've got a better idea.

25:08.465 --> 25:09.466
Oh!

25:14.429 --> 25:15.889
Can I help you?

25:16.848 --> 25:19.226
I got call for third-floor ladies' room.

25:19.976 --> 25:21.436
Gladys Tinkerton.

25:21.519 --> 25:24.940
Toilets full, not flush. Bad smell.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.483
Called at 04:14.

25:26.566 --> 25:27.400
And you're getting here now?

25:27.484 --> 25:29.027
Are you only customer?

25:29.110 --> 25:32.155
Do I sit by phone
and wait for only toilets here to back up?

25:32.864 --> 25:33.782
Just give me a second.

25:33.865 --> 25:35.033
Yeesh...

25:37.702 --> 25:40.121
This is Mike from CDC Security.
Is this Gladys?

25:40.205 --> 25:41.414
<i>Did you call for a plumber?</i>

25:41.498 --> 25:45.627
Oh, yeah. The third-floor ladies' room
is backed up like you wouldn't believe.

25:46.419 --> 25:48.255
Total nightmare. Thanks.

25:52.008 --> 25:53.009
Ooh!

26:04.521 --> 26:05.480
Oh, yeah! Yeah.

26:13.154 --> 26:14.197
Ravi?

26:15.657 --> 26:17.075
Ravi Chakrabarti?

26:19.035 --> 26:21.329
You have me confused with someone.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.873
Uh, I'm sorry,
you're really gonna pull that?

26:29.004 --> 26:31.923
Oh, my God.
You don't even remember me, do you?

26:32.007 --> 26:35.593
You don't remember having
a really amazing first date with me,

26:35.677 --> 26:38.471
charming me into bed,
and then never calling me after?

26:59.617 --> 27:02.996
The problem was me, I was too immature.

27:03.079 --> 27:06.291
I wasn't ready for someone like you.

27:06.374 --> 27:08.918
I wish someone would
just be honest with me for once.

27:09.252 --> 27:10.879
I mean, it's not
like I was all in love with you.

27:11.254 --> 27:12.839
I didn't even remember you being Russian.

27:13.423 --> 27:14.799
-You are too needy.

27:16.092 --> 27:17.761
Are you finished in the bathroom?

27:17.844 --> 27:19.804
We're kind of in the middle
of something here.

27:23.433 --> 27:24.392
Go on.

27:27.937 --> 27:31.107
You are attractive girl.

27:31.191 --> 27:33.985
With confidence, more attractive.

27:34.736 --> 27:36.529
Hmm? Know your worth.

27:38.865 --> 27:41.785
Thank you
for honestly answering my question.

27:44.913 --> 27:45.914
I wish you all the best.

27:59.427 --> 28:00.762
[electronic music
continues on earphones]

28:25.078 --> 28:26.746
Hey, Magic Mike.

28:27.163 --> 28:28.957
Ravi's back with the card.
Where's your mark?

28:30.792 --> 28:32.085
I'll get the card. You stall.

28:33.211 --> 28:34.129
Gladys.

28:35.505 --> 28:36.589
Gladys.

28:38.883 --> 28:39.926
Where are you going?

28:40.927 --> 28:42.011
You're a tease.

28:42.804 --> 28:44.305
I booty-called my building manager.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.190
Hey. Hey.

28:54.774 --> 28:56.693
I saw you flirting with my man.

28:56.776 --> 28:58.027
How he was coming on to you.

28:58.153 --> 28:59.154
Yeah?

29:01.448 --> 29:03.324
I'll be thinking
about that all night.

29:06.995 --> 29:07.996
You're welcome.

29:12.375 --> 29:14.043
You had one job.

29:28.224 --> 29:30.435
-Yes!
-Oh, my God.

29:31.811 --> 29:33.062
I'm so sorry.

29:33.146 --> 29:34.773
Oh, you're five minutes late, it's fine.

29:34.856 --> 29:37.108
I'm feeding the kids cereal for dinner
and letting them beat me at poker.

29:40.695 --> 29:42.322
Peyton Charles losing?

29:43.198 --> 29:44.657
Now that just doesn't seem right.

29:51.456 --> 29:52.999
-You don't have to do this.
Sure, I do.

29:53.750 --> 29:56.002
See, your boyfriend took something
that was mine.

29:56.544 --> 29:57.879
That doesn't sit well with me.

29:58.004 --> 29:58.922
"Something"?

29:59.672 --> 30:01.508
They're human beings. They're kids.

30:01.591 --> 30:02.467
They're not yours.

30:02.592 --> 30:05.386
You really don't think
a human being can't belong to someone?

30:06.638 --> 30:07.680
Blaine.

30:09.891 --> 30:10.975
Blaine, please.

30:11.059 --> 30:12.852
And you're gonna beg me now, Peyton?

30:14.103 --> 30:15.438
Is that what we're at?

30:20.276 --> 30:21.486
I'm not letting you take them.

30:23.863 --> 30:25.156
Sweetheart.

30:25.907 --> 30:27.033
You don't have a choice.

30:28.618 --> 30:29.661
You're gonna kill me, huh?

30:30.161 --> 30:31.663
That's how important money is to you.

30:32.956 --> 30:34.082
You're gonna shoot me?

30:34.165 --> 30:35.583
Pretty, pretty, pretty.

30:39.546 --> 30:40.922
I don't have to kill you.

30:45.426 --> 30:47.262
No, no, no!

30:48.096 --> 30:50.557
Him... I had to kill.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.643
Well... ish.

30:54.686 --> 30:55.812
-You...

30:56.896 --> 30:57.981
Oh, wait.

30:58.815 --> 30:59.691
Were you...

31:01.067 --> 31:02.694
Sweetie, honey, baby.

31:03.987 --> 31:06.406
Were you still secretly hoping
I was a good guy?

31:09.742 --> 31:10.785
Yeah.

31:11.911 --> 31:13.079
I was, too.

31:13.162 --> 31:15.665
Holy crap!

31:15.748 --> 31:18.042
You were serious about that closet!

31:18.126 --> 31:19.794
Dude, how do we not have one of these?

31:20.420 --> 31:21.588
Wait, is there more of them?

31:23.590 --> 31:25.133
I don't think everyone's gonna fit
in the van.

31:25.800 --> 31:26.968
We'll make room.

31:28.011 --> 31:29.304
-Worst-case scenario...

31:32.557 --> 31:35.435
you can sit on my lap.

31:36.603 --> 31:38.980
So, the entire block
from Fifth Avenue to Spring Street

31:39.063 --> 31:40.273
is a war zone right now.

31:40.356 --> 31:43.276
We take the perimeter,
apprehend anyone armed.

31:44.986 --> 31:46.446
Something you wanna say, Ames?

31:46.529 --> 31:48.156
All due respect, sir,

31:48.281 --> 31:50.199
but our people have a right to be angry.

31:50.283 --> 31:52.076
Our mission isn't to take sides.

31:52.660 --> 31:55.580
Lives are at stake here,
humans and zombies alike.

31:56.706 --> 31:57.874
Stay focused.

32:40.541 --> 32:41.459
Get to cover!

32:50.843 --> 32:51.761
Hands up!
You're surrounded.

32:51.886 --> 32:53.012
Don't shoot!

32:53.262 --> 32:54.639
Okay, move forward.
Don't shoot!

32:55.014 --> 32:56.516
Zombie bastards!
Okay!

33:21.499 --> 33:22.959
I want these men taken alive.

33:23.960 --> 33:24.836
Yes, sir.

33:25.336 --> 33:26.796
Figured I'd run into you eventually.

33:29.716 --> 33:32.760
Your weapons are pointed
the wrong way, gentlemen.

33:33.970 --> 33:36.180
This war has just begun.

33:36.514 --> 33:39.058
The future of our species is at stake.

33:40.727 --> 33:42.228
You can die, here,

33:42.311 --> 33:46.482
for the sake of this... leader.

33:48.484 --> 33:51.904
Or you can live, to fight by my side
for zombie-kind.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.159
That is the choice.

33:59.245 --> 34:00.413
Ames, with me. That's an order.

34:02.623 --> 34:03.708
Sorry.

34:03.791 --> 34:04.959
It's the only way.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.685
Look at the zombie lives I just saved.

34:26.564 --> 34:28.316
Except for one, of course.

34:37.992 --> 34:39.035
Load up.

34:40.995 --> 34:42.163
We have work to do.

34:49.921 --> 34:52.131
Okay. So, here we go again.

34:52.215 --> 34:54.717
Last night's pre-heist heist,
was it flawless?

34:54.801 --> 34:57.637
No. Did we kick ass and take names?
Metaphorically, we did.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.972
Are we finished? Not by a long shot.

35:00.264 --> 35:02.892
This is the big show, gang.
So, let's review.

35:02.975 --> 35:05.144
First, Ravi hacks the security cameras.

35:05.228 --> 35:07.355
Done already. Easy-peasy.

35:07.438 --> 35:08.731
I'm not slow like you.

35:08.815 --> 35:11.943
Second, thank the saints,
we eat new brains.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.279
Because this one
is getting on my last nerve.

35:17.740 --> 35:19.450
-Pfft.
-Pfft.

35:21.828 --> 35:23.079
<i>Clive enters through the front,</i>

35:23.204 --> 35:26.499
<i>past the racist security guard</i>
<i>who thinks all black men look the same.</i>

35:44.392 --> 35:45.560
<i>By now, the brains are kicking in.</i>

35:45.643 --> 35:48.688
<i>And it's time for Ravi and I</i>
<i>to show Zone 19 who's boss.</i>

35:48.771 --> 35:50.690
It's all you, buddy, it's go time.
You got this.

35:50.773 --> 35:51.607
You got this.

35:51.691 --> 35:53.734
We got this together.
But you really got this.

35:53.818 --> 35:54.944
I'm with you, man.

35:55.778 --> 35:56.696
It's go time.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.324
<i>Once inside, we'll make our way</i>
<i>through the main building.</i>

36:14.714 --> 36:17.216
<i>We rendezvous with Charli</i>
<i>and Clive in the storage area.</i>

36:18.885 --> 36:22.388
<i>Then use Charli's retinal scan</i>
<i>to access Saxon's restricted lab.</i>

36:25.308 --> 36:27.143
It was a little anticlimactic, actually.

36:27.226 --> 36:28.144
So, yeah.

36:34.525 --> 36:35.526
You owned that!

36:35.610 --> 36:36.652
You owned that so hard.

36:38.279 --> 36:39.322
Happy to help.

36:41.282 --> 36:43.993
Charli, thank you.

36:44.952 --> 36:46.037
We couldn't have done this without you.

36:46.120 --> 36:46.996
No way.

36:47.246 --> 36:48.497
You just...

36:49.582 --> 36:51.417
-You just owned that so hard.
-Yeah.

36:51.500 --> 36:52.460
You're welcome.

36:55.338 --> 36:56.756
You're okay.

36:58.132 --> 37:00.384
You're gonna have some brain tubes
soon, right?

37:02.511 --> 37:03.888
That looks like the vault.

37:06.307 --> 37:07.308
Well, all right then. Let's hope this works.

37:16.692 --> 37:17.777
<i>We're making an easy ganache.</i>

37:18.152 --> 37:20.738
<i>We're gonna let this melt.</i>
<i>This is gonna take about 10 to 15 minutes</i>

37:20.821 --> 37:21.989
<i>for the chocolate to--</i>

37:22.657 --> 37:25.409
<i>Good evening, Seattle. I am Enzo Lambert,</i>

37:25.743 --> 37:27.912
<i>the new Commander of Fillmore Graves.</i>

37:27.995 --> 37:30.581
<i>For too long, zombies have lived in fear</i>

37:30.665 --> 37:34.377
<i>of human extremists attacking our kind</i>
<i>with impunity.</i>

37:35.211 --> 37:36.170
<i>This stops now.</i>

37:36.545 --> 37:41.300
<i>These men helped ambush and murder</i>
<i>some of my comrades this very day.</i>

37:41.717 --> 37:43.177
<i>Under the previous regime,</i>

37:43.261 --> 37:45.221
<i>they would have been turned over</i>
<i>to the police.</i>

37:45.304 --> 37:49.183
<i>This method of deterrence</i>
<i>has proved ineffective.</i>

37:49.267 --> 37:53.437
<i>So, starting today,</i>
<i>terror will be met with terror.</i>

37:53.521 --> 37:54.939
<i>-Come.</i>
<i>Please.</i>

37:57.149 --> 37:58.401
<i>-Oh, my God!</i>
<i>No.</i>

37:58.985 --> 38:00.069
<i>I'm begging you, please.</i>

38:00.194 --> 38:01.195
<i>No, no, no, no, no!</i>

38:01.737 --> 38:02.613
<i>Scratch him.</i>

38:02.697 --> 38:03.572
<i>No, please. Don't!</i>

38:05.324 --> 38:06.826
<i>No, please!</i>

38:14.834 --> 38:16.377
<i>To the humans of Seattle,</i>

38:16.460 --> 38:19.880
<i>if you allow us to live in peace,</i>
<i>we will do the same.</i>

38:20.506 --> 38:23.175
<i>To the United States government</i>
<i>and the world,</i>

38:23.259 --> 38:27.722
<i>you have long held the threat</i>
<i>of the nuclear option over our heads.</i>

38:29.390 --> 38:32.893
<i>As you see,</i>
<i>with our new breed of zombie soldiers,</i>

38:33.811 --> 38:36.772
<i>we now have a nuclear option of our own.</i>

38:42.611 --> 38:43.654
There it is.

38:44.030 --> 38:45.114
It's war.

38:45.865 --> 38:47.867
Get out there and recruit
every human you can.

38:47.950 --> 38:51.203
If they have a pulse and a God,
I want them holding a weapon.

38:57.626 --> 39:00.129
Sir, there is no way someone got in here
without us knowing.

39:00.296 --> 39:02.214
I got a call that someone broke in.

39:02.298 --> 39:03.549
It's better safe than sorry. Come on, come on.

39:26.489 --> 39:27.656
Thank God.

39:36.165 --> 39:38.751
We knew it would be impossible
to get into that vault.

39:38.834 --> 39:41.212
So, we figured we'd have you do it for us.

39:41.295 --> 39:43.089
Yeah, and...

39:43.172 --> 39:45.800
I'm the one who called you
to say someone broke into your lab.

39:46.300 --> 39:47.676
My American accent's on point.

39:47.802 --> 39:49.970
Okay. Look, I was wrong.

39:50.054 --> 39:50.971
Think so?

39:51.055 --> 39:52.056
I shouldn't have kept you out of the loop. I was greedy.

39:53.557 --> 39:55.309
But there's some real money
to be made here.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.352
Enough for all of us.

39:56.435 --> 39:58.729
Do you know how many people will die
without that cure?

39:58.854 --> 40:00.398
We can't save everyone.

40:01.190 --> 40:03.192
How about coming out
on top for once, Ravi?

40:05.152 --> 40:08.489
Oh, you're thinking about it. Aren't you?

40:09.573 --> 40:11.158
No. Ravi!

40:22.586 --> 40:24.130
We have it, Ravi. It's over.

40:32.388 --> 40:33.556
We did it.

40:35.224 --> 40:36.684
Mission possible, baby. Holy crap, we really did it.

40:41.147 --> 40:42.273
Clive, we did it.

40:42.398 --> 40:43.399
We did do it.

40:43.482 --> 40:45.860
And we should get out of here
before he regains consciousness

40:45.943 --> 40:46.819
and we undo it.

40:47.236 --> 40:48.612
Major, it's me.

40:48.696 --> 40:50.239
We got the formula and we're heading back.

40:50.322 --> 40:53.159
We just need the Max Rager
from Fillmore Graves, and then...

40:53.242 --> 40:54.577
we've got the cure.

40:55.619 --> 40:56.620
<i>That's great.</i>

40:56.704 --> 40:58.080
Really great news.

40:58.747 --> 40:59.665
I could use some good news.

41:00.875 --> 41:02.793
Sorry, we got to run
before security gets here. So just--

41:02.877 --> 41:03.794
<i>Right.</i>

41:04.587 --> 41:07.965
Just, uh, get the Max Rager
from the storage area in Fillmore Graves.

41:08.090 --> 41:09.550
<i>Don't worry.</i>

41:10.885 --> 41:11.719
I'll get it.
