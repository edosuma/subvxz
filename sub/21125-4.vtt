WEBVTT

00:06.374 --> 00:06.507
.

00:06.574 --> 00:08.642
- I gotta say,
for a hospital cafeteria,

00:09.310 --> 00:10.178
that a was a very good hoagie.

00:11.011 --> 00:11.379
- Yeah.

00:11.479 --> 00:12.780
Ooh! Hey, Mags.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.148
Can I take
some of this gauze home?

00:15.549 --> 00:17.251
- Sometimes
I like to wrap Charlotte up

00:17.351 --> 00:18.652
like a little mummy.
- Don't touch anything.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.388
You're gonna get me in trouble.

00:20.488 --> 00:21.789
- Maggie--Oh, hey, Emma.
Did you guys hear about

00:21.889 --> 00:23.457
the guy in room 304?

00:23.557 --> 00:25.126
- Secret vasectomy.

00:27.161 --> 00:28.662
- He's got six kids,
and he doesn't want anymore.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.731
So he told his wife he was
coming in for an appendectomy.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.533
- Well, he's a third of the way
to a Duggar's situation.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.435
So can you blame him?
- No, I can't.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.337
Winter is coming!

00:36.437 --> 00:38.206
- Oh, my God. Get out of here.

00:38.306 --> 00:39.740
You gotta get out of here.
You can't be behind here.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.810
- Paging Dr. Yes Please.
- You are heavier than you look.

00:45.413 --> 00:46.747
Hey.

00:46.847 --> 00:50.151
Just got some test--uh,
the samples of the test that--

00:50.251 --> 00:51.552
back.

00:51.652 --> 00:53.554
- I just actually wanted
to ask you a favor.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.191
- The hospital is doing
a promotional video

00:57.291 --> 00:59.427
all about the nurse's program,
and I thought of you.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.695
- To be in the video.

01:01.795 --> 01:03.731
I think you'd be perfect for it.
You're one of our best nurses.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.166
- Oh.
- You know,

01:05.266 --> 01:07.635
I did some summer stock.

01:07.735 --> 01:12.106
I was in an all male production
of "Kiss Me Kate."

01:12.206 --> 01:13.741
It was very edgy.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.176
Very raw.

01:15.276 --> 01:16.844
I was Kate.

01:16.944 --> 01:19.147
- Jeff, there are
so many other things

01:19.247 --> 01:20.848
that you should be doing
right now.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.086
How's that? No.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.855
- So, look.
You don't have to be in it,

01:27.955 --> 01:29.590
but I'm gonna do it,
and I thought

01:29.690 --> 01:31.125
maybe we could do it together?

01:31.225 --> 01:32.360
- I will do it.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.761
- Yup.
- Well, that's great.

01:33.861 --> 01:35.629
That's great.
- Yeah. Great.

01:35.729 --> 01:38.332
- Thank you.
- Thank you for thinking of me.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.600
- Good.

01:39.700 --> 01:40.734
All right.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.736
See you in the hallway.

01:42.836 --> 01:46.407
Who is that guy?

01:46.507 --> 01:48.476
- He's Dr. Ericson.
Dr. Popsicle.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.278
- Oh, my God. This is just like
"Pride and Prejudice."

01:50.378 --> 01:52.646
Just with worst clothes.
- Hey, they're scrubs.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.615
I've told you. I'm not allowed
to cinch them at the waist.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.617
- I'm gonna start
planning your wedding.

01:56.717 --> 01:59.287
- Okay, you're overreacting.
- And I'm taking this gauze.

01:59.387 --> 02:00.488
- Put it back!

02:00.588 --> 02:02.390
- For the veil.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.760
- You're not as graceful
as you think you are.

02:06.860 --> 02:11.232
- * Hey, remember when

02:11.332 --> 02:14.568
* All of time stood still

02:14.668 --> 02:18.772
-* Ooh!
- * Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

02:18.872 --> 02:21.809
* Back before we were brittle

02:21.909 --> 02:25.413
* Back before
we were brittle *

02:26.714 --> 02:29.583
- I can't believe you're eating
a family sized plate

02:29.683 --> 02:31.252
of spaghetti at 7:30
in the morning.

02:31.352 --> 02:33.621
- I'm carbo-loading.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.356
- I volunteered to teach
a bike safety class

02:35.456 --> 02:37.625
for the community center.

02:37.725 --> 02:39.593
Wait, what are you eating?
- Cantaloupe.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.295
Like a normal person.
- That was my head melon!

02:42.896 --> 02:44.832
- A head melon is the melon
I hand to a child

02:44.932 --> 02:46.800
to smash against the pavement
at the end of class

02:46.900 --> 02:49.237
so they'll see what'll happen
if they don't wear a helmet.

02:49.337 --> 02:51.405
- Okay, that's horrifying.
Never do that to children.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.307
- We give it a name so
they'll develop an attachment.

02:53.407 --> 02:55.543
- And once it's smashed,

02:55.643 --> 02:57.811
I bring out
two smaller melons to grieve.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.480
- Good morning!

02:59.580 --> 03:02.250
- Ooh! Lookie, lookie.
Who stole the cookie now?

03:02.350 --> 03:03.851
You've stepped it up
to a smoky eye.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.286
- Yeah, today's the video shoot.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.389
For the video shoot?
- Yeah.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.224
- No.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.694
- He's a handsome doctor
that Maggie's in love with

03:13.794 --> 03:15.696
who's also in love with Maggie.
- None of that is true.

03:15.796 --> 03:18.799
- Hey, hands off the merch!

03:18.899 --> 03:20.601
- 'Cause they're up,
and they're ready to play.

03:20.701 --> 03:21.969
- I'm wearing
different scrubs, okay?

03:22.069 --> 03:23.571
So I had to wear
a different bra.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.339
- I don't know anything

03:25.439 --> 03:27.508
about his personal life
because all we talk about

03:27.608 --> 03:29.443
are bedpans and bloody sheets.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.978
- Well, I've seen enough
"US Weeklys" to know

03:31.078 --> 03:33.314
that the stars--
they are just like us.

03:33.414 --> 03:34.748
And when you guys
get together on set--

03:34.848 --> 03:36.750
Mmm! That magic's gonna explode.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.586
- Okay, well, he's not a star.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.821
He's a doctor.
A very gifted doctor.

03:40.921 --> 03:43.457
- You know, doctors know
all of the appropriate

03:43.557 --> 03:45.693
medical terminology for
your erogenous zones.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.595
- Hey, Zach,
not in front of Charlotte.

03:47.695 --> 03:50.464
- A masseuse once stimulated
my popliteal fossa so much

03:50.564 --> 03:52.466
I had to excuse myself.
- Oh, Zach!

03:52.566 --> 03:54.001
- It's the back my knee.

03:54.101 --> 03:56.737
- Wow, this is
a lot of people, right?

03:56.837 --> 04:00.341
- Yeah.
I'm nervous. Are you nervous?

04:00.441 --> 04:02.009
You don't seem nervous.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.611
- Well--
- You never do.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.979
- Yeah, I'm just good
at faking it, really.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.615
Um.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.450
Have you done something
different with your hair?

04:09.550 --> 04:12.853
- Uh, yeah.
Just a little beachy wave.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.655
- It's nice.
- I also have on a push-up bra.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.324
- Me too.
- I don't know why I said that.

04:16.424 --> 04:17.658
What?

04:17.758 --> 04:19.360
- I thought you said
you do push-ups.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.728
What did you say?

04:20.828 --> 04:22.430
- I wish that is what
I had said,

04:22.530 --> 04:25.032
but I said that
I have on a push-up bra.

04:25.132 --> 04:26.500
- I'm not, by the way.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.768
I'm not--
I didn't put one on today.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.837
- Okay.
- Yeah.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.772
- Yo, yo! My stars!

04:31.872 --> 04:33.774
How's it going
Feel stoked? You look beautiful.

04:35.576 --> 04:36.677
You're gorgeous.
- No.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.646
- Hello.

04:38.746 --> 04:41.382
- I'm the director.
My name is Duff. Okay?

04:41.482 --> 04:42.850
So basically, when I say action,

04:42.950 --> 04:44.785
I need you to be a doctor

04:44.885 --> 04:45.919
and you to be a nurse.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.455
- Okay, well that should be easy

04:47.555 --> 04:48.756
because he's a doctor
and I'm a nurse.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.424
- Oh, dip!
You're already there!

04:50.524 --> 04:52.393
You're already in character.
- Mm-hmm.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.528
- I need you two to have
a connection, okay?

04:54.628 --> 04:56.397
Beyond
the doctor/nurse relationship,

04:56.497 --> 04:57.565
there's something underneath,
right?

04:57.665 --> 04:58.899
You're not just coworkers.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.000
There's a vibe. There's a magic.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.402
You gotta catch it.

05:01.502 --> 05:02.670
Do you get it?

05:02.770 --> 05:04.638
- Uh, yeah.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.407
- Yeah, probably.
- Absolutely.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.775
- 'Cause that magic

05:07.875 --> 05:09.910
that we create together--
- Yeah.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.679
- That's the stuff that's gonna
win us those Dusters.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.581
- Right. Sorry.
What's a duster?

05:13.681 --> 05:15.349
- Oh, that's basically
the Oscars for industrials.

05:15.449 --> 05:17.084
- Yeah.
- I got two of them.

05:17.184 --> 05:18.819
One for a CostCo spot
I did last month,

05:18.919 --> 05:20.754
and then I worked with Merrill.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.456
- Lynch.
All right, we got five.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.492
Let's do this!
Let's make this magic!

05:24.592 --> 05:27.327
- Right. So this guy is
a complete idiot.

05:27.428 --> 05:28.996
I might totally understand
if you want to bail,

05:29.096 --> 05:30.798
but please don't

05:30.898 --> 05:32.666
'cause I don't think
I can do this without you.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.568
I want one of those Dusters.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.437
- I do, too.
- I want that Duster

05:36.537 --> 05:37.971
on my shelf, yo.
- Oh, yes please.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.473
- Now, remember:

05:39.573 --> 05:41.909
"Wear your helmet like
a hat, or--"

05:42.009 --> 05:44.845
Do it, Vernon.
- "Your brain goes splat!"

05:44.945 --> 05:46.714
- Oh, no!

05:46.814 --> 05:47.915
No!

05:48.015 --> 05:50.117
Okay.
You guys put your helmets on,

05:50.217 --> 05:51.852
and ride like the wind.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.120
Go! Hiya!

05:54.455 --> 05:55.456
Hiya!

05:55.556 --> 05:56.924
- Great class, Zach.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.426
Charlotte loves cantaloupe.

05:58.526 --> 05:59.960
- Bruce!
What are you doing here?

06:00.060 --> 06:01.395
And this little angel's
too young for bike riding.

06:01.495 --> 06:02.863
- I'm not here for Char-bar.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.898
I'm here for
I-don't-know-how-to-ride-a-bike.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.901
I-don't-know-how-to-ride-a-bike.

06:09.236 --> 06:10.671
- I don't know
how to ride a bike.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.606
- A grown man
who can't ride a bike?

06:12.706 --> 06:14.742
What's wrong with you?

06:14.842 --> 06:15.809
- Shut up, Vernon.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.411
You don't know
how to drive a car.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.480
Nailed it.
- Well, no, Bruce.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.615
You didn't nail it
because Vernon is a child.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.383
So no one expects him
to be able to drive,

06:23.484 --> 06:24.885
but you're a grown man.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.154
You
- You're right, Zach.

06:27.254 --> 06:29.089
Also, I apologize, Vernon.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.691
I didn't realize you're a child.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.826
- It's okay.
- I'm gonna get going.

06:35.195 --> 06:39.399
- Bruce, do you want me to offer
to teach you to ride a bike?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.802
- That's right.
- Yeah, I thought so.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.571
I'll do it.
- You don't--if you want.

06:43.671 --> 06:44.905
You want to?
- But first, I want you to

06:45.005 --> 06:47.040
clean up this melon.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.176
Is it--is this, like,
"Karate Kid?"

06:49.276 --> 06:51.779
- Sure, Bruce.
- Melon on, melon off.

06:51.879 --> 06:54.582
- Here at
Pinebrook Memorial Hospital,

06:54.682 --> 06:56.617
the doctors work
hand in hand with nurses

06:56.717 --> 06:59.620
to provide patients with
the best care possible.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.656
- Here's that file, Doctor.
- Thank you very much.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.058
'Cause we're not just coworkers.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.894
We're family.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.831
- And cut!

07:10.931 --> 07:14.001
Oh! You guys are crushing it.
Let's lunch!

07:14.101 --> 07:15.936
- So, um--sorry about the--
putting my arm around you.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.938
- Oh, yeah.
I noticed that you did that.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.940
- Yeah, it's just
I felt it in the moment

07:20.040 --> 07:21.975
so I just wanted to--
- It was nice, it was, uh--

07:22.075 --> 07:24.778
it was a nice moment to feel.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.013
- Good.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.615
Well, um,

07:27.715 --> 07:29.049
I'm gonna go and get
one of those sandwiches

07:29.149 --> 07:30.618
I've been hearing so much about.

07:30.718 --> 07:33.053
- Oh, yeah.
Those have been out for a while

07:33.153 --> 07:34.655
so maybe hit the cafeteria.

07:34.755 --> 07:36.189
- Good call.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.691
- So, yeah. Okay.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.960
See you after lunch.
- All right.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.697
"

07:43.797 --> 07:45.666
"Felt it in the moment?"
This is writing itself.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.868
You can't just keep showing up.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.503
- That was electric.

07:49.603 --> 07:50.738
- You and Dr. E.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.806
It was, like, "The Notebook."

07:52.906 --> 07:54.575
I was gonna pull an alarm
and just have it rain down.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.577
- Did you see him
put his arm around me?

07:56.677 --> 07:57.745
- Uh, that wasn't in the script.
- I know!

07:57.845 --> 07:59.847
- So here's the next step.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.582
I want you to go over there and
ask him to have lunch with you.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.016
- No. I can't.
- Yes.

08:03.116 --> 08:05.118
- Yes. Yes, you can.

08:05.218 --> 08:06.854
And don't you worry about me

08:06.954 --> 08:08.188
'cause I got one of
those hoagie's in my purse.

08:08.288 --> 08:10.123
- Okay. I'll do it.

08:10.223 --> 08:11.959
- Go get him, Gosling.

08:13.026 --> 08:16.897
- Whoa. Who's that woman
in the chunky wedge?

08:16.997 --> 08:19.499
both: Oh, no.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.935
- Guess we're going
halfsies on that hoagie.

08:28.776 --> 08:29.042
.

08:29.109 --> 08:31.011
- I don't buy it.
- They kissed on the mouth.

08:31.478 --> 08:32.646
- She kissed him,

08:33.681 --> 08:34.147
and there is no way
that Colin Firth is attracted

08:34.915 --> 08:35.983
to a woman wearing
a chunky wedge.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.151
- Well, if that's
the kind of woman he wants,

08:39.152 --> 08:40.187
he obviously isn't interested
in this old rag.

08:41.088 --> 08:41.989
- Hey, ladies.
- Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.

08:42.690 --> 08:43.591
What do you know about the woman

08:44.457 --> 08:45.125
that Dr. E's been
running around with?

08:46.059 --> 08:47.127
- Not much,
but her name is Apryl with a Y,

08:47.227 --> 08:48.829
she's a producer from New York,

08:48.929 --> 08:50.598
she has a Missoni bag,
which I know is real

08:50.698 --> 08:52.700
because I checked.
She spends her summers in Naples

08:52.800 --> 08:54.234
and her winters in Jersey City,

08:54.334 --> 08:56.003
and she was spotted with
Dr. Ericson last night

08:56.103 --> 08:58.271
eating fro-yo.
- Do you think that they're,

08:58.371 --> 08:59.840
like, together?
'Cause we saw them kiss.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.208
- Oh, my God,
of course they did!

09:01.308 --> 09:02.976
I have to go tell Nancy
down in the morgue.

09:03.076 --> 09:03.977
She's gonna die!

09:04.077 --> 09:05.078
Oh.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.281
Of course salt-and-pepper
gorgeous doctor

09:08.381 --> 09:10.651
with a gift for
healing people is taken.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.185
- I'm sorry, Cathy Cartoon.

09:12.285 --> 09:15.255
Sweat, sweat, tears.
Cats, chocolate!

09:15.355 --> 09:17.290
- Not a current reference.
- Not interested!

09:17.390 --> 09:19.693
Now I want you to
get down there and charm him

09:19.793 --> 09:21.228
with your signature body rolls.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.130
- How am I gonna work body rolls
into a nursing video?

09:23.230 --> 09:24.965
- You'll find a way. Come on.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.567
Give me some of
those body rolls.

09:28.702 --> 09:31.104
Yeah. Okay!

09:31.204 --> 09:32.205
Yeah!

09:32.305 --> 09:34.141
- I still don't feel good.

09:34.241 --> 09:37.144
- Don't worry, Charlotte.
Don't be afraid!

09:37.244 --> 09:39.146
- She's not afraid, Bruce.
You're afraid.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.148
I'm gonna hold on to you
till we get going,

09:41.248 --> 09:42.783
then I'm gonna let go.
- Don't let go. Never let go.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.718
- Well, relax.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.286
If you fall down,
you're gonna get back up again.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.121
- I don't know what that is.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.090
Doesn't matter.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.892
My dad always used to say to me,

09:51.992 --> 09:53.627
"If you fall down, stay down.

09:53.727 --> 09:54.962
"Play dead, Bruce.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.229
That's the only way
you'll ever survive."

09:56.329 --> 09:58.131
- That is extremely disturbing.

09:58.231 --> 10:01.835
- I really just want to be able
to teach Char-bar one day.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.737
- You're a good dad, Bruce.

10:03.837 --> 10:06.306
- You are, too, Zach.

10:06.406 --> 10:07.607
- Okay.

10:07.708 --> 10:08.909
Now keep your head up.
- Okay.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.911
- Don't look at the ground.

10:11.011 --> 10:12.012
Look where you want to go.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.313
There you go!

10:13.413 --> 10:14.848
No, no, no, no.
Don't look at the ground!

10:14.948 --> 10:17.117
- Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

10:17.217 --> 10:20.287
Ow!

10:20.387 --> 10:22.055
- Well, that's a lesson
for you, Charlotte.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.824
- Ow!

10:23.924 --> 10:25.325
- This--
- Oh, God!

10:25.425 --> 10:27.961
- Is what it sounds like
when a grown man cries.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.663
- Look, I want you
to remember your lines,

10:29.763 --> 10:31.364
and then forget them.
- Okay, I think I got it.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.167
- Also, you have a secret,
but don't tell me what it is.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.169
Let us know that you have one,
but don't tell the secret.

10:36.269 --> 10:38.338
- Okay, I'm a little confused
on that one.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.873
- Shh!

10:39.973 --> 10:42.042
It's a secret.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.643
- Maggie. Hi.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.145
- Hey.
- It's your big scene.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.313
- Yeah, yeah, I guess.

10:46.413 --> 10:47.815
- So I missed you at lunch.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.082
I saved you a seat.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.251
- Oh, I thought
you had other plans.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.086
- All right! Pictures up!

10:53.186 --> 10:54.822
Roll sound, please!

10:56.356 --> 10:57.958
That wouldn't make you nervous?

10:58.058 --> 10:59.359
- No, I'd love for you to watch.

10:59.459 --> 11:00.961
- Great.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.763
'Cause I'd love to watch you.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.134
Sorry. Yeah. That's--Okay.

11:07.234 --> 11:08.301
Uh, yes. Good luck.

11:08.401 --> 11:09.970
- Thank you.
- With it.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.438
- Clear the set!
- Okay!

11:11.538 --> 11:13.406
Thanks, Jimmy.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.407
Everybody set?

11:14.507 --> 11:17.110
And action!

11:17.210 --> 11:19.079
- Here at Pinebrook Memorial,

11:19.179 --> 11:20.981
we believe that
hands-on experience

11:21.081 --> 11:22.382
is the best way to learn.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.985
That's why we pair
our nurses with doctors

11:25.085 --> 11:27.054
with doctors with doctors

11:27.154 --> 11:28.956
with hands-on experience
on your shoulders

11:29.056 --> 11:30.758
and secret whispers.

11:30.858 --> 11:33.360
* Pinebrook Memorial

11:33.460 --> 11:35.929
* We're doing it right

11:36.029 --> 11:37.397
* All night

11:37.497 --> 11:39.132
* And we're doing it,
and doing it *

11:39.232 --> 11:40.868
* And doing it right
- Cut! Cut!

11:40.968 --> 11:42.269
All right!
- Okay.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.037
- Good, good, good.
I like your creativity.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.138
This is a dialogue, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.406
- Let's just do it again,

11:46.506 --> 11:48.008
but can we have
absolutely no singing?

11:48.108 --> 11:50.043
'Cause it's super weird.
- No!

11:50.143 --> 11:51.344
It's not
a word I like, okay?

11:51.444 --> 11:53.013
I don't say it,
and I don't spray it.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.748
- Okay, man.
I wasn't saying no to you.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.283
- There it is again!

11:56.383 --> 11:57.951
- I think I just need
a little space.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.987
Would you mind backing off?
- Listen, sweetie!

12:00.087 --> 12:01.154
You don't have to respect me,

12:01.254 --> 12:02.823
but you will respect my Dusters.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.158
- "A duhhh!
You gotta respect my Dusters!"

12:05.258 --> 12:06.894
You have a weird hat, man!

12:06.994 --> 12:08.796
- Yeah, I think

12:08.896 --> 12:10.430
your hat's weird. I think
you need to control your set.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.332
You got a bunch of
wild cards walking around,

12:12.432 --> 12:14.167
rubbing people's shoulders
in clomp-clomp city

12:14.267 --> 12:15.335
with their chunky wedges,

12:15.435 --> 12:17.270
and I'm not interested.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.306
Okay?
So let's take it from the top!

12:19.406 --> 12:20.974
- That's my line!
Take it from the top!

12:21.074 --> 12:22.475
- And action!

12:29.883 --> 12:31.819
He's just such a good guy,
so of course he's taken.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.854
He's Liam Neeson taken.
- But I know

12:33.954 --> 12:36.523
you two have good chemistry.
I've seen it.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.425
- That doesn't mean
he doesn't have a girlfriend.

12:38.525 --> 12:39.893
- I'm gonna need to get
my eyes on this situation.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.063
- I'm using
the bird's eye view camera

12:43.163 --> 12:45.165
so we'll see if Dr. E and
Chunky Wedge leave together.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.934
- We're gonna sit here
all night

12:47.034 --> 12:49.002
- Yeah. I got an eight of
a hoagie left in my purse.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.337
- Fine.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.105
I'll find another way
to get in there.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.974
Break my leg or something.
- You're not gonna do that.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.976
- Yeah. That's right.
I'd break my leg for you.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.011
Are you surprised to hear that?
- No, you wouldn't.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.813
- Yes, I would.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.348
I would snap it in half
like those guys from the Mafia.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.283
- Slow your roll,
Paulie Walnuts.

13:03.383 --> 13:04.952
- Bruce, it is now or never.

13:05.052 --> 13:07.054
Do not look at the ground.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.222
Okay? Look at Charlotte.
It's all for her.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.494
It's working.

13:14.594 --> 13:17.097
I'm riding a bike!

13:17.197 --> 13:20.333
- Charlotte,
your uncle Zach is a genius.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.370
- Anywhere I want!

13:23.470 --> 13:25.572
- We'll pick him up
at Sizzler's.

13:25.672 --> 13:29.009
- We just have
a routine physical in 203.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.377
- Maggie, before we go in,

13:30.477 --> 13:32.980
can I ask you a question?
- Yes.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.148
- It's, uh--
it's a lady question.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.884
- Okay.
- Is it normal for a woman

13:36.984 --> 13:39.386
to kiss you full on the lips
every time they meet you?

13:39.486 --> 13:41.421
- Is this a woman
that you know well?

13:41.521 --> 13:43.223
- No. I don't know her at all.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.458
It's the producer
from the video promo shoot.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.395
I mean,
she gives me a full lip plant

13:48.495 --> 13:49.997
every time she meets me.
It's, um--

13:50.097 --> 13:51.598
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I think I--

13:51.698 --> 13:53.433
I feel like
I vaguely remember seeing that.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.335
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:55.435 --> 13:56.603
- She said, um, "That's just
how we roll in show business."

13:56.703 --> 13:58.305
- Well, that's not true.

13:58.405 --> 14:00.107
I mean,
I don't think that's right.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.274
I thought
she was your girlfriend.

14:01.374 --> 14:02.309
- Yeah.

14:02.409 --> 14:03.877
- No.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.947
- No. And she's not my type.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.181
At all.

14:13.620 --> 14:16.289
- Okay, um,
I think we should probably--

14:16.389 --> 14:18.158
- Oh, yes. Absolutely.
- Yeah. Yeah.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.562
Hello.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.164
- Hello, doctor.

14:24.264 --> 14:28.235
And hello, nurse
I've never met before.

14:36.009 --> 14:36.109
.

14:38.979 --> 14:39.312
That must be hard
for your wife.

14:39.812 --> 14:40.347
- I'm not married.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.515
Okay. Her eyes are fine.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.184
- Yeah,
maybe just check her ears

14:44.284 --> 14:45.986
'cause I don't think
she's hearing words

14:46.086 --> 14:47.887
when people say them.
- What I do have, doctor,

14:47.988 --> 14:49.489
is a huge heart

14:49.589 --> 14:52.159
because I would just do anything
for the people that I love.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.027
- And when was the last time
you had a physical?

14:54.127 --> 14:55.595
- I don't know.
Probably when I was, like, ten.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.564
both: Ten?
- I was very busy as a child.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.566
- Right. We're gonna need
to do a full work-up.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.935
- Oh, we'll do
a full work-up, all right.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.470
- So Maggie's gonna do your
blood panel and your vitals.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.338
I will be right back.
- No, no--

15:05.438 --> 15:07.941
- Great. Love that.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.943
I'm gonna straight up
murder you!

15:10.043 --> 15:11.511
- You have taken
a Hippocratic oath

15:11.611 --> 15:13.146
not to harm me! Ow!

15:13.246 --> 15:16.083
- Your happiness is on the line,

15:16.183 --> 15:17.985
and now, we know
that he's not married.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.053
You're welcome.
- I already knew that.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.454
- I also know that Chunky Wedge

15:21.554 --> 15:23.090
is just some floozy
from Jersey City

15:23.190 --> 15:25.225
who can't keep her lips off him.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.027
- Single, and also,
right before we came in here,

15:27.127 --> 15:29.396
we had a very intense moment.
- Wow. I knew it.

15:29.496 --> 15:32.199
He likes you. He likes you!

15:32.299 --> 15:33.566
- Good God.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.668
Yes. 98.6.
- Hey.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.437
- Just where we want it.
- Yeah.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.239
- If you'd just like
to lie back,

15:39.339 --> 15:41.241
we're gonna do a breast exam.
both: What's that now?

15:41.341 --> 15:43.243
- Well, I mean, you haven't had
a full physical in 25 years.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.645
It's standard protocol,
and Ms. Crawford,

15:45.745 --> 15:48.115
you should be doing
a self-exam every month.

15:48.215 --> 15:51.084
That's a lot
of action for these old jams.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.453
- Okay. If you can just
put your feet up here.

15:53.553 --> 15:56.956
I'm so sorry.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.291
- Okay.
- Yes.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.060
- Doctor,
you think maybe this is

16:00.160 --> 16:01.361
one of those opportunities
for me to get

16:01.461 --> 16:02.729
that hands-on experience

16:02.829 --> 16:04.731
that we've been hearing
so much about?

16:04.831 --> 16:06.666
- Good idea. Are you okay
with that, Ms. Crawford?

16:06.766 --> 16:09.236
- Oh, yes.
I prefer the touch of a woman.

16:09.336 --> 16:10.403
- All right.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.075
- Wow, now that is
a tender touch.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.676
Just from what
I can only imagine

16:16.776 --> 16:18.545
would be a very gentle
and skilled lover.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.080
Come on, man.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.715
- Meet her needs
as well as yours.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.219
You guys know each other,
don't you?

16:26.319 --> 16:28.321
- Um, I think I may have
passed you in the hallway?

16:28.421 --> 16:30.023
- Yes, this is
my best friend, Emma, okay?

16:30.123 --> 16:31.691
She came here under
false pretenses.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.760
I did not sign off on this,
but apparently,

16:33.860 --> 16:36.329
she also needs a physical.
- I do. I'm sorry.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.165
I'd been hearing
so much about you at home,

16:38.265 --> 16:39.666
so I just wanted to get
my eyes in the situation.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.401
- I'm sorry,
you've been talking about me?

16:41.501 --> 16:43.436
- She has. She can't shut up
about you. Actually--

16:43.536 --> 16:46.473
- Okay, I'm so sorry.
This is very unprofessional.

16:46.573 --> 16:49.209
- Yeah. It really is.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.211
What's she been saying?
- Oh, all kinds of things.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.313
She said you had
a very intense moment.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.415
- Hey, guys, you wanna
dive back into this exam?

16:55.515 --> 16:57.117
Maybe we should do that.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.121
- Hm.
- Um, Dr. Ericson,

17:01.221 --> 17:03.123
can you, um, check this?
- Sure.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.558
What's going on?
- It's probably nothing.

17:05.658 --> 17:08.061
You just haven't had an exam,
so we don't have a baseline.

17:08.161 --> 17:10.697
'Cause I have very lumpy boobs.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.199
Not to brag,
but in eighth grade,

17:12.299 --> 17:14.201
Josh Rosenfarb called me
Lumplestiltskin.

17:14.301 --> 17:16.203
- Yeah.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.438
Is it bad?

17:18.538 --> 17:20.273
- No, it's probably nothing.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.343
I mean, at your age, I mean,
really probably nothing,

17:23.443 --> 17:24.644
but, um, yeah.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.646
We are going to have to
run some tests.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.648
Just to make sure.

17:31.751 --> 17:35.088
*

17:37.524 --> 17:39.192
- I don't know
if you're nervous, but don't be.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.060
I did a lot of Googling
last night--

17:41.161 --> 17:42.662
- Don't do that.
What were you Googling?

17:42.762 --> 17:44.131
- Ways you can die
before you're 40.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.432
- Emma--
- Turns out,

17:45.532 --> 17:47.200
I have a bigger chance of, like,

17:47.300 --> 17:49.269
dying in a shark attack
than I do of having cancer.

17:49.369 --> 17:50.837
- Well, there was that
nurse shark that went crazy

17:50.937 --> 17:52.639
on that woman up by Mystic,
but she fought back.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.641
She punched him in the nose.
- See. Proves my point.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.110
Nothing to worry about.
- I'm not worried, I just--

17:57.210 --> 17:59.379
You know, he brought us in.
He didn't call.

17:59.479 --> 18:02.449
- Yeah, but that's just the kind
of class act this guy is.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.251
That's British. Okay?

18:04.351 --> 18:05.785
That's why I'm so excited
you guys are gonna be humping

18:05.885 --> 18:07.420
each other soon.
- Okay.

18:12.959 --> 18:16.763
Good afternoon, Doctor.

18:16.863 --> 18:21.701
- Now, I've got
the results from the lab.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.403
It is cancer.

18:23.503 --> 18:26.706
The good news is
we've caught it very early

18:26.806 --> 18:29.276
thanks to Emma
being a good friend.

18:29.376 --> 18:30.677
Okay?

18:30.777 --> 18:32.712
Now, I've already made
an appointment

18:32.812 --> 18:35.448
with the best
surgical oncologist

18:35.548 --> 18:36.849
on the East Coast.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.252
She's a good friend of mine,
and, um,

18:39.352 --> 18:41.521
she's agreed to see us
tomorrow. Okay?

18:41.621 --> 18:45.792
Emma, I know this is
very difficult news to hear,

18:45.892 --> 18:48.428
but I'd like you
to take this step by step.

18:48.528 --> 18:51.364
The good news is
that we've caught it early.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.765
You're very young,

18:52.865 --> 18:54.767
and all of that
is very encouraging.

18:54.867 --> 18:57.304
*

18:57.404 --> 19:00.473
- I'll tell you what this is.
This is some bullshit!

19:00.573 --> 19:02.775
Hey, in "Terms of Endearment,"
what does she die of?

19:02.875 --> 19:05.144
Is it breast cancer?
Google it.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.180
- That was, like, 1982.
- Just Google it! Please!

19:07.280 --> 19:08.681
- Debra Winger
dies in everything.

19:08.781 --> 19:11.184
- "Beaches." She has
breast cancer, doesn't she?

19:11.284 --> 19:12.852
That's what she has.
I'm pretty sure.

19:12.952 --> 19:15.255
Google that.
We need to know, Maggie!

19:15.355 --> 19:16.923
- I won't. I won't Google it.
- Please Google it, Maggie!

19:17.023 --> 19:19.359
Can you just Google it, please?

19:24.797 --> 19:27.534
- Oh, I know, I know.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.669
I know.

19:29.769 --> 19:33.640
- You know, if this was just me,
it's, like, whatever.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.508
But then I think about
Charlotte,

19:35.608 --> 19:37.410
and I have to be there for her

19:37.510 --> 19:38.745
because, you know,

19:38.845 --> 19:41.348
who's gonna be there
to hide her pot?

19:41.448 --> 19:42.849
- I don't want you
to hide her pot.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.517
- I have to, though.
- No, no, no.

19:44.617 --> 19:47.354
If she wants to do pot,
you come to me, okay?

19:47.454 --> 19:50.890
- Maggie, do you think
I'm gonna be okay?

19:51.824 --> 19:53.493
- I do.

19:53.593 --> 19:54.794
- Yeah.

19:54.894 --> 19:58.265
I mean, I don't really know,
but, like...

19:58.365 --> 20:00.867
we got the best people
on the case, right?

20:00.967 --> 20:02.669
Like, the best doctors ever.
- Yeah.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.771
- And I have never met
a stronger woman than you

20:04.871 --> 20:06.539
in my entire life.

20:06.639 --> 20:10.543
Okay? So cancer has picked
the wrong duo to mess with.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.279
I'll tell you that much.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.681
And I'm not gonna leave
your side for one second.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.649
I'm gonna be fighting with you
every step of the way.

20:16.749 --> 20:19.286
'Cause I got a real attitude
when it comes to things

20:19.386 --> 20:20.920
that mess with my friends.
- Hey, Mags!

20:21.020 --> 20:22.589
Guess who wrote his bike
all the way to Danbury?

20:22.689 --> 20:24.291
Bruce!

20:24.391 --> 20:25.792
- Yeah, he popped
a full wheelie.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.260
Uh, it was actually
.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.795
It scared him pretty good,
but, uh--

20:28.895 --> 20:30.663
What's going on?

20:36.869 --> 20:37.337
.

20:40.307 --> 20:46.913
*

20:50.016 --> 20:55.322
*
