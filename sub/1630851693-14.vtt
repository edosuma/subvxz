00:01.413 --> 00:03.310
[narrator] Previously on,
90 Day Fiance: The Other Way.

00:03.413 --> 00:05.103
[woman] All your
documents are okay,

00:05.206 --> 00:08.137
so we can start your wedding
procedure on Wednesday.

00:09.241 --> 00:10.344
[Steven] Wow.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.103
Two days from now.

00:12.206 --> 00:14.241
That's not a lot of time
to plan a wedding.

00:14.344 --> 00:15.206
[chuckles nervously]

00:16.241 --> 00:18.620
[Kenny] Good morning.
It's wedding day.

00:18.724 --> 00:20.655
I know, I'm excited.

00:20.758 --> 00:22.758
[Armando] But,
I'm a little nervous.

00:22.862 --> 00:26.103
Just thinking about
my dad seeing us kiss
for the first time.

00:26.206 --> 00:28.586
I don't want them to be
disgusted or anything
like that like, ugh.

00:28.689 --> 00:29.620
Oh, babe,

00:29.724 --> 00:30.689
don't overthink it.

00:30.793 --> 00:32.034
You gotta move on from that.

00:33.137 --> 00:34.896
Hi, Bini! Hi, Ari!

00:35.310 --> 00:36.413
Hi, Jessica!

00:36.517 --> 00:38.068
[Ari] Yesterday,
I got an email

00:38.172 --> 00:40.896
saying that his K1 process
is finally moving along.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.413
We have an interview date

00:42.517 --> 00:44.206
in 19 days.

00:44.310 --> 00:46.689
So, we're gonna
have to go to Ethiopia

00:46.793 --> 00:48.413
as soon as next week.

00:48.517 --> 00:50.655
Oh, my God. So, okay,
I'm freaking out now.

00:50.758 --> 00:54.241
I'm in no way, mentally
or physically prepared
to go back to Ethiopia.

00:54.344 --> 00:57.103
But if I don't,
it will hurt Bini's
chances of being approved.

00:59.931 --> 01:02.344
[Corey] I have to say
that you're not invited
to the wedding.

01:02.724 --> 01:03.620
Really?

01:03.724 --> 01:05.241
I don't like the fact that...

01:05.344 --> 01:08.310
I'm your only friend
and Evelin doesn't want
me to come to the wedding.

01:08.413 --> 01:10.689
You know, I would like
you to be there but...

01:10.793 --> 01:13.000
I do anything wrong,

01:13.103 --> 01:15.241
like, she could
call off the wedding.

01:16.896 --> 01:19.689
[Jenny] We started the
marriage application process,

01:19.793 --> 01:22.517
and then Sumit called
the lawyer and told him
to stop and wait.

01:22.620 --> 01:24.172
He's not quite ready yet.

01:24.275 --> 01:27.206
If he's not ready
to walk the mile for you,

01:27.310 --> 01:30.586
then he's not giving you
what you deserve, right?

01:30.689 --> 01:31.896
Just walk away.

02:08.034 --> 02:09.931
[Sumit] I went
to saw my nephew

02:10.034 --> 02:11.655
and when I come back home,

02:11.758 --> 02:13.793
I find Jenny already asleep.

02:17.620 --> 02:19.275
What's up?

02:19.379 --> 02:22.586
Last thing I heard
Jenny to say, that she needed

02:22.689 --> 02:23.965
to make some decisions.

02:31.344 --> 02:33.172
[Jenny] So, you got in
late last night.

02:34.310 --> 02:36.103
I was waiting
for you to come home.

02:36.206 --> 02:39.241
I wanted to talk to you.
I've been wanting to talk
to you since you left.

02:40.517 --> 02:42.275
After we had that...

02:42.379 --> 02:44.896
conversation outside
and I got so upset,

02:45.000 --> 02:47.344
you know, just walked
in the house and left you,

02:47.448 --> 02:49.034
I felt so bad.

02:49.137 --> 02:50.931
This is what we've
been fighting for,

02:51.034 --> 02:52.517
for such a long time.

02:53.413 --> 02:54.724
So...

02:54.827 --> 02:56.103
you stopped the
marriage process.

02:56.206 --> 02:58.344
I was like, "Whoa," you know,
"What the hell just happened?"

02:59.931 --> 03:01.344
I still can't believe
he stopped

03:01.448 --> 03:03.448
our marriage application
from being processed

03:03.551 --> 03:04.896
and didn't tell me.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.448
What he did yesterday

03:06.551 --> 03:07.965
makes me just want to give up.

03:08.068 --> 03:09.931
I should just let Sumit go.

03:44.620 --> 03:46.655
[Sumit] I don't want
to spoil the relation,

03:46.758 --> 03:48.896
I don't want to
spoil the like...

03:49.000 --> 03:50.689
like, love we are having
with each other.

03:50.793 --> 03:52.586
I will marry you
because I want to.

03:52.689 --> 03:54.551
I want to be with you.
I don't want to lose you.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.137
I want to keep
experiencing that love.

04:01.724 --> 04:03.517
That makes me feel great.

04:03.620 --> 04:05.310
I'm happy to hear that.

04:05.413 --> 04:08.137
I'm ready. You are ready.
Both are ready and
let's do it.

04:31.517 --> 04:33.448
-[Jenny] I love you.
-[Sumit] Love you too.

04:35.655 --> 04:36.620
Thank you, baby.

04:36.724 --> 04:37.965
You're welcome.

04:38.068 --> 04:39.586
So, you ready
to call the lawyer?

04:39.965 --> 04:41.103
Yeah, I am.

04:41.586 --> 04:42.413
Okay.

04:43.758 --> 04:45.551
I feel really good
and happy today,

04:45.655 --> 04:47.517
and a lot of relief.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.517
Sumit realizes that
he does love me,

04:49.620 --> 04:51.206
and he wants
to marry me and...

04:51.310 --> 04:52.724
he doesn't want to lose me.

04:52.827 --> 04:53.793
[line ringing]

05:00.344 --> 05:01.724
-[Sumit] Hello
-[Jenny] Hi!

05:01.827 --> 05:04.620
-Hi, Rishabh.
-Hello. Hi, hi, how are you?

05:04.724 --> 05:07.068
We are doing great.
Remember I...

05:07.172 --> 05:09.379
I called you and asked
you to put that uh,

05:09.482 --> 05:12.034
marriage application on hold.

05:12.137 --> 05:14.758
-Yes.
-So, now I want
to resume that.

05:14.862 --> 05:16.724
Like, I want
to start the process.

05:33.655 --> 05:34.931
-[Jenny laughing]
-Yay.

05:35.034 --> 05:36.827
Thank you so much.

05:37.758 --> 05:39.206
-You're welcome
-[both] Bye!

05:45.689 --> 05:46.896
Better know you're
gonna be happy.

05:49.137 --> 05:50.000
Me too.

05:53.793 --> 05:54.655
You're happy.

05:59.172 --> 06:00.448
I told you so.

06:03.103 --> 06:04.689
-Can you believe it?
-No.

06:05.793 --> 06:07.862
-I love you.
-I love you too.

06:07.965 --> 06:08.793
So much.

06:11.896 --> 06:13.241
You can't get rid of me now.

06:13.896 --> 06:15.034
Oh, my God.

06:15.137 --> 06:16.241
I didn't think about that.

06:32.551 --> 06:33.965
[Steven humming]

06:35.793 --> 06:38.275
Came so fast, it's hard
to believe it's already here.

06:39.206 --> 06:41.275
Yeah, it's true.

06:41.379 --> 06:42.862
-Hoo!
-[Alina laughs]

06:43.379 --> 06:46.000
Today is the day.

06:46.103 --> 06:47.931
Alina and I are
getting married,

06:48.034 --> 06:49.620
which is crazy because

06:49.724 --> 06:51.482
people will spend months
planning their wedding

06:51.586 --> 06:52.724
and we're just gonna like...

06:53.034 --> 06:54.137
do it.

06:54.241 --> 06:56.103
Are you excited to see me

06:56.206 --> 06:57.275
in a wedding dress?

06:57.965 --> 06:58.793
I am

06:58.896 --> 07:01.172
super excited.

07:01.275 --> 07:02.413
Me too.

07:02.517 --> 07:04.724
With the amount of time
we had, I think,

07:04.827 --> 07:06.448
it's almost impossible
to really...

07:07.448 --> 07:10.206
be 100% ready to get married.

07:10.310 --> 07:11.724
But we both love each other

07:11.827 --> 07:12.862
and we want to be married

07:12.965 --> 07:14.517
and we want to be
together forever.

07:15.034 --> 07:15.931
So,

07:16.034 --> 07:17.241
this is what we need to do.

07:19.034 --> 07:20.068
Oh, you're ready to leave.

07:22.655 --> 07:25.344
Yeah. You have ample time
to get your hair and
make-up done.

07:25.448 --> 07:27.827
Then I'll be waiting
for you at the venue.

07:27.931 --> 07:29.103
I am bringing my laptop

07:29.206 --> 07:31.275
so we can call our families.

07:31.379 --> 07:33.034
We're gonna be one family now.

07:33.137 --> 07:35.172
-Wow.
-Wow.

07:37.551 --> 07:39.827
[Alina] Finally,
it's the wedding day.

07:48.275 --> 07:49.413
-[woman] Hello.
-Hey,

07:49.517 --> 07:50.793
Are you the...

07:54.586 --> 07:55.655
[Alina] I always...

07:55.758 --> 07:56.827
dreamed that

07:56.931 --> 07:58.827
I'm gonna have a lot of

07:58.931 --> 08:02.655
friends and family
on my wedding.

08:02.758 --> 08:04.724
But I'm still excited that

08:04.827 --> 08:07.413
I'm going to marry Steven.

08:26.551 --> 08:28.275
[Steven] I always
pictured my wedding

08:28.379 --> 08:29.931
in the church, with like...

08:30.034 --> 08:32.137
groomsmens and the...

08:32.241 --> 08:34.862
maids of honor and our family.

08:36.034 --> 08:37.103
But...

08:37.206 --> 08:40.034
because Alina and I
are alone in Turkey,

08:40.137 --> 08:43.482
none of our friends or family
will even be at the wedding.

08:46.896 --> 08:49.275
So, I have some surprises

08:49.379 --> 08:51.689
that I want to get
ready for her.

08:51.793 --> 08:53.896
[Steven] Today, we're
going to try to pick up
her favorite cats.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.275
If we can find them.

08:55.379 --> 08:56.620
Mr. Cuddles,

08:56.724 --> 08:58.241
Cucumber,

08:58.344 --> 09:00.620
Cactus and Cow Cat.

09:00.724 --> 09:03.448
I'm gonna invite some of
the neighborhood cats,

09:04.793 --> 09:06.103
and bring them along
to the wedding.

09:08.586 --> 09:10.758
I think Alina's going
to be very excited.

09:10.862 --> 09:12.793
Honestly, nothing
can replace family

09:12.896 --> 09:14.241
but this is a close second.

09:18.931 --> 09:20.344
No, this is...

09:20.448 --> 09:22.275
not one of the cats
that is invited.

09:24.068 --> 09:25.310
Mr. Cuddles!

09:26.310 --> 09:27.310
Meow!

09:28.103 --> 09:28.931
Mau!

09:35.068 --> 09:36.517
[Steven meowing]

09:36.620 --> 09:37.448
Cactus.

09:38.379 --> 09:39.206
It's me.

09:42.827 --> 09:44.586
Oh, boy.

09:44.689 --> 09:46.344
It's proving to be
a little more challenging

09:46.448 --> 09:48.034
than I thought
it was going to be.

09:48.137 --> 09:50.344
The regulars aren't
showing up today.

09:50.448 --> 09:51.620
I mean, these cats
are regular,

09:51.724 --> 09:53.310
we just haven't named them.

09:53.413 --> 09:55.413
And we're not super
close to them.

09:55.517 --> 09:57.965
So, I don't feel
it's appropriate to
invite them to the wedding.

09:58.793 --> 10:00.068
So, I think I'm gonna have to

10:00.172 --> 10:01.758
take some more
desperate measures.

10:04.379 --> 10:05.206
Okay.

10:09.310 --> 10:10.137
Okay!

10:11.068 --> 10:11.931
[grunting]

10:18.413 --> 10:19.551
No!

10:30.965 --> 10:32.413
Ah! Cow Cat!

10:34.827 --> 10:36.241
Mr. Cuddles!

10:37.413 --> 10:39.413
This is Mr. Cuddles
and this is Cow Cat.

10:40.413 --> 10:41.724
Alright, guys, come here.

10:43.344 --> 10:45.793
You can go in there.
Now I'll give you food.

10:45.896 --> 10:49.034
It was such a treat to find...

10:49.827 --> 10:51.827
Mr. Cuddles and Cow Cat

10:51.931 --> 10:54.000
just chilling
at the same bench.

10:54.103 --> 10:55.482
Come on, Mr. Cuddles.

10:55.586 --> 10:56.827
The time is ticking

10:56.931 --> 10:58.241
to get to the venue,

10:58.344 --> 11:00.000
get everything set up, so

11:00.103 --> 11:01.448
it's perfect for Alina.

11:01.551 --> 11:03.275
Good job, Mr. Cuddles.

11:03.379 --> 11:04.517
This is really happening.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.482
I'm marrying Alina.

11:06.586 --> 11:08.103
Now we're going to
be together forever.

11:08.206 --> 11:09.448
Alright, come on.

11:09.551 --> 11:11.034
This is for Alina, guys.

11:11.137 --> 11:12.448
We're doing this together.

11:26.551 --> 11:28.379
[Ari] I've been thinking
about what the lawyer said,

11:28.482 --> 11:30.482
and she really caught me
off-guard saying that,

11:30.586 --> 11:33.275
you know, we have to
leave right away for Ethiopia.

11:33.379 --> 11:35.862
I'm not sure if I want
to go with you.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.206
[Corey] Oh boy, it starts.

12:00.310 --> 12:03.241
Where is my suit, actually?

12:03.344 --> 12:05.724
Oh, my gosh. Today is my
wedding day and I'm just

12:05.827 --> 12:07.379
feeling all kinds of emotion.

12:07.482 --> 12:08.586
I am...

12:08.689 --> 12:10.793
I am terrified, I'm happy,
I'm excited, I'm...

12:10.896 --> 12:13.275
every kind of emotion
you can possibly think of,

12:13.379 --> 12:14.413
all wrapped up in one.

12:17.344 --> 12:18.724
Totally already got it dirty.

12:20.551 --> 12:22.482
Twice. Three times!

12:24.206 --> 12:25.551
Three times dirty.

12:26.275 --> 12:27.448
I am...

12:27.551 --> 12:29.068
very nervous...

12:30.241 --> 12:32.000
and a little excited.

12:32.931 --> 12:35.551
Today is completely different

12:35.655 --> 12:36.827
to my first wedding day.

12:36.931 --> 12:38.586
Because my first wedding day,

12:38.689 --> 12:40.275
it was just Corey and me,

12:40.379 --> 12:41.620
without...

12:41.724 --> 12:44.344
thinking about
all the surrounders.

12:46.172 --> 12:49.103
And I mostly worry about
how I am going to feel

12:49.206 --> 12:51.000
before I walk down the aisle.

12:53.344 --> 12:55.137
-Hey, beautiful!
-Morning.

12:55.241 --> 12:57.000
Good morning. I know
I'm not supposed to see you

12:57.103 --> 12:59.689
but I'm so sorry,
I couldn't help myself.

12:59.793 --> 13:02.793
-I know.
-You are so beautiful.
You excited?

13:02.896 --> 13:03.827
So excited.

13:03.931 --> 13:04.862
-Are you nervous?
-I am...

13:04.965 --> 13:07.206
-I'm super nervous.
-I am. I am.

13:07.310 --> 13:10.310
-I hope that everything
goes well today.
-Yes.

13:10.413 --> 13:13.137
I hope that you don't
have second thoughts
about anything.

13:13.241 --> 13:15.551
That's not how
you deal with stress.

13:15.655 --> 13:18.068
Or you have anxiety or
a panic attack or something,

13:18.172 --> 13:20.482
you're very quick
to cancel plans.

13:20.586 --> 13:21.896
You're very quick to...

13:23.241 --> 13:25.103
say, "I don't want
to do this anymore."

13:26.448 --> 13:28.068
It's not like I can schedule
panic attacks,

13:28.172 --> 13:30.034
so, hopefully,
I don't have any one.

13:30.137 --> 13:30.965
Sounds good?

13:34.103 --> 13:35.206
For the last...

13:36.275 --> 13:37.172
four years,

13:37.275 --> 13:38.724
I've been dealing with

13:38.827 --> 13:42.034
major anxiety
for the first two,

13:42.137 --> 13:45.034
and now I'm way
better with that.

13:45.137 --> 13:47.689
But it's something
that is part of me,

13:47.793 --> 13:49.241
and I struggle with.

13:50.965 --> 13:53.965
I want you to know, like,
if something like this happens

13:54.068 --> 13:55.724
just text me, or call me.

13:55.827 --> 13:57.620
-You know how I am.
-Don't run away.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.206
[Evelin] When I get very
anxious and I have
a panic attack,

14:01.310 --> 14:04.068
like, if we are in a movie
theater watching a movie,

14:04.172 --> 14:06.896
and then, I suddenly
have a panic attack,

14:07.000 --> 14:09.310
I'm like, I have to go,
I have to go. And I go.

14:09.862 --> 14:11.034
So,

14:11.137 --> 14:13.137
I think that his worriness

14:13.241 --> 14:14.620
for me not showing up

14:14.724 --> 14:16.517
due to a panic attack
are totally real.

14:17.551 --> 14:18.862
Just know that like,

14:18.965 --> 14:21.310
your option doesn't have to be

14:21.413 --> 14:23.068
to not go through
with the wedding.

14:23.172 --> 14:25.241
I'm going to go to
the wedding venue now,

14:25.344 --> 14:26.448
gonna get ready,

14:26.551 --> 14:28.655
but I do not want to see you

14:28.758 --> 14:30.862
till you are
at the altar, okay?

14:31.551 --> 14:32.517
Of course.

14:35.551 --> 14:36.862
I'll see you later.

14:53.172 --> 14:54.793
I'm forgetting
how to tie a tie.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Oh, my gosh. This is so weird.

15:01.275 --> 15:03.758
[Corey] Not having
a best man with me or,

15:03.862 --> 15:04.862
anybody, is...

15:04.965 --> 15:05.931
not how I...

15:06.586 --> 15:07.724
imagined my wedding day.

15:09.862 --> 15:11.034
Aha!

15:11.137 --> 15:12.448
I think we're onto something.

15:15.931 --> 15:18.724
At least I have puppy
as my best man.

15:18.827 --> 15:20.448
Be nice to have
my brother but...

15:22.620 --> 15:23.793
it's nice having puppy.

15:31.862 --> 15:33.103
Ow, it stings.

15:33.379 --> 15:34.551
Woo hoo.

15:34.655 --> 15:36.517
Six o' clock already.
Oh my gosh.

15:40.448 --> 15:41.551
Got my rings,

15:42.068 --> 15:43.344
uh, leash

15:43.448 --> 15:44.758
for puppy.

15:45.586 --> 15:46.689
Ah, okay,

15:47.413 --> 15:49.206
we're going to do this puppy!

15:49.310 --> 15:50.827
Oh my gosh, this is it.
This is the moment.

15:50.931 --> 15:52.379
It's happening,
It's happening,
I can't believe it.

15:52.482 --> 15:53.620
Wake up, Corey.

15:53.724 --> 15:56.172
Ah, wake up!
Come on, let's do this.

15:56.275 --> 15:57.586
I'm seriously
so nervous right now.

15:57.689 --> 15:58.620
This is crazy.

15:58.724 --> 15:59.793
Can't believe it's happening.

16:05.931 --> 16:07.448
[woman cheering]
[women laughing]

16:10.034 --> 16:10.862
No.

16:59.620 --> 17:01.896
My mom is saying
that marriage is for life

17:02.000 --> 17:03.448
and definitely
freaking me out.

17:03.551 --> 17:05.896
It's not like, oh, for life.
It's like...

17:06.000 --> 17:06.862
for life.

17:11.000 --> 17:11.896
Go on.

17:13.655 --> 17:14.689
Let's go, buddy.

17:15.862 --> 17:17.137
Hey, hey!

17:18.827 --> 17:20.344
How are you guys? Hey hey.

17:20.448 --> 17:22.000
-Hey, looking' sharp.
-Congratulations.

17:22.103 --> 17:23.068
Thank you so much.

17:23.172 --> 17:24.586
-Corey.
-Hey!

17:25.517 --> 17:26.413
Hey!

17:31.586 --> 17:33.137
I feel like this.

17:33.241 --> 17:37.034
I never in my wildest dreams
thought Evelin would actually

17:38.000 --> 17:40.275
agree to having a wedding.

17:40.379 --> 17:42.241
To be honest,
I'll believe it when I see it.

17:42.344 --> 17:43.758
When she is there
at the altar with me,

17:43.862 --> 17:45.000
then I'm gonna believe it.

17:57.206 --> 17:58.758
I keep telling myself,

17:58.862 --> 18:00.793
you're already married Evelin.

18:00.896 --> 18:02.034
Go through this.

18:02.724 --> 18:04.793
But I still am terrified.

18:37.931 --> 18:40.551
So, how much time till
Evelin's ready, do you think?

18:42.275 --> 18:43.206
30 minutes?

18:43.310 --> 18:44.206
Okay.

18:48.551 --> 18:49.551
[Corey] Oh, no.

18:52.689 --> 18:54.413
Evelin has made it
very clear to me

18:54.517 --> 18:57.379
that she doesn't want
Raul at all to come
to this wedding.

18:58.827 --> 18:59.758
Hey, Corey!

19:00.793 --> 19:02.655
If Evelin finds out
Raul's here,

19:02.758 --> 19:04.137
that could really
trigger Evelin

19:04.241 --> 19:06.172
and it could be a disaster.

19:07.068 --> 19:08.137
Well, surprise surprise.

19:09.413 --> 19:10.827
Surprise, surprise.

19:15.517 --> 19:16.931
[Kenny] How am I gonna
get through this day?

19:17.034 --> 19:18.551
[all exclaiming]

19:18.655 --> 19:20.379
We've had a lot of obstacles

19:20.482 --> 19:22.206
with his family,

19:22.310 --> 19:23.827
with me moving here.

19:23.931 --> 19:26.724
I can't believe this moment
has finally arrived.

20:05.068 --> 20:06.586
[Armando] Kenny and I
decided that it'd be best

20:06.689 --> 20:08.413
that we got ready separately.

20:08.517 --> 20:10.000
And we won't be
seeing each other

20:10.103 --> 20:11.379
until we walk down the aisle

20:11.482 --> 20:12.344
at our ceremony.

20:16.310 --> 20:18.620
I wish I was getting ready
with Kenny just because

20:18.724 --> 20:21.000
it makes it more stressful
not to be together.

20:21.862 --> 20:23.344
But I do think that

20:23.448 --> 20:24.793
being with my family,
getting ready,

20:24.896 --> 20:27.103
will make us a little closer
right before the wedding.

20:27.206 --> 20:28.793
It'll be an intimate
moment for us,

20:29.758 --> 20:30.758
so, I like that.

20:33.965 --> 20:35.241
[Kenny] Let's do a cheer.

20:36.034 --> 20:36.965
Tay Tay?

20:37.862 --> 20:39.862
[Taylor] To a happy...

20:39.965 --> 20:42.586
life filled with laughter
and love and...

20:42.689 --> 20:43.620
-all the good things.
-Yeah.

20:43.724 --> 20:46.275
-Put it on a sign.
-Positive things.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.689
That's what we're about.

20:48.655 --> 20:49.724
This is a big day for me.

20:49.827 --> 20:51.586
For one, I never
really thought

20:51.689 --> 20:53.931
I could ever marry
another man.

20:54.034 --> 20:56.586
So, I never thought a wedding
for me was ever in...

20:56.689 --> 20:58.275
my future.

20:58.379 --> 21:01.448
And I really didn't know
how badly I wanted it

21:01.551 --> 21:02.896
until I met Armando.

21:06.068 --> 21:07.344
How am I gonna
get through this day?

21:07.448 --> 21:08.758
[all exclaiming]

21:08.862 --> 21:10.379
Get it out now.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.482
I'm accomplishing something

21:15.586 --> 21:18.172
that I never dreamed really
that would be possible.

21:19.896 --> 21:21.137
Let's do a group hug.

21:32.482 --> 21:33.620
What?

21:33.724 --> 21:34.931
She's wearing a dress.

21:35.034 --> 21:37.344
It's a girl so it's
wearing a girl dress?

21:37.448 --> 21:39.206
Yeah, she is,
because she's a girl.

21:39.310 --> 21:41.172
Okay.

21:41.275 --> 21:44.310
I can't believe this
moment has finally arrived.

21:44.413 --> 21:45.310
You ready to go?

21:45.413 --> 21:47.655
-You got Truffles?
-Yep.

21:47.758 --> 21:49.137
Because we had to

21:49.241 --> 21:51.068
jump through a lot of hoops

21:51.172 --> 21:52.344
to be together.

21:52.448 --> 21:54.172
But at this moment,
it's just...

21:54.275 --> 21:55.896
kind of, like, coming to...

21:56.689 --> 21:58.689
my head and my heart.

21:58.793 --> 22:01.275
Everything we've been through
to get here, and we did it.

22:02.103 --> 22:03.103
[guests chattering]

22:09.137 --> 22:10.482
That's a big dress.

22:18.965 --> 22:20.137
[Armando giggling]

22:24.586 --> 22:26.000
[Armando] I kind of have
mixed emotions.

22:27.241 --> 22:29.206
[Armando sniffling]

22:29.310 --> 22:32.551
Hey, I'm just happy I'm about
to marry the love of my life.

22:32.896 --> 22:33.862
But,

22:33.965 --> 22:35.241
me having this wedding,

22:35.344 --> 22:38.827
it's like a final coming out
to all of my family members.

22:38.931 --> 22:40.448
And all attention is on us.

22:43.931 --> 22:45.482
I don't know what
I'm more worried about,

22:45.586 --> 22:47.000
the kiss or the first dance.

22:49.413 --> 22:51.655
It'll be the first kiss
they see between two men.

22:51.758 --> 22:53.689
So, knowing that
that's the case,

22:53.793 --> 22:55.137
it makes me a little nervous.

22:57.724 --> 22:59.413
[crowd gasping]

23:05.965 --> 23:06.862
I'm gonna cry.

23:31.241 --> 23:32.724
[piano music playing]

23:39.931 --> 23:41.965
[Kenny] Armando and I
decided to walk

23:42.068 --> 23:44.310
on the outside of
the aisle to the altar,

23:44.413 --> 23:46.655
because we both
took different paths

23:46.758 --> 23:48.655
in our life to get
to this point.

23:50.137 --> 23:51.896
We've had a lot of obstacles

23:52.000 --> 23:53.758
with his family,

23:53.862 --> 23:55.655
with me moving here,

23:55.758 --> 23:58.931
and fighting for
our marriage license.

23:59.034 --> 24:01.586
But every roadblock
that happened,

24:01.689 --> 24:02.965
we busted through it.

24:03.862 --> 24:06.034
We were meant to be together.

24:06.137 --> 24:07.793
We were meant to fall in love.

24:13.896 --> 24:15.448
We were meant to get married.

24:20.448 --> 24:21.275
Good?

24:24.724 --> 24:25.965
[Armando] I just see Kenny,

24:26.068 --> 24:28.310
and I know I can leave
behind all the stress

24:28.413 --> 24:30.965
and all the worries
that I had before.

24:31.068 --> 24:32.827
I'm not worried about
what anybody's thinking,

24:32.931 --> 24:34.482
and I'm about to marry

24:34.586 --> 24:35.931
the love of my life.

24:36.034 --> 24:36.965
And that's all that matters.

24:39.034 --> 24:40.413
[pastor] Good afternoon
to all.

24:41.862 --> 24:43.517
We are gathered here today

24:43.965 --> 24:45.310
to celebrate

24:45.413 --> 24:48.241
the marriage ceremony
of Kenneth and Armando.

24:56.034 --> 24:57.448
No union

24:57.551 --> 24:59.586
is more profound than marriage

25:01.275 --> 25:02.586
for it embodies

25:02.689 --> 25:04.172
the highest ideals

25:04.793 --> 25:05.758
of love,

25:05.862 --> 25:06.689
fidelity,

25:07.103 --> 25:08.241
devotion,

25:08.344 --> 25:09.655
sacrifice,

25:09.758 --> 25:11.206
and family.

25:11.310 --> 25:13.172
Before you declare your love,

25:13.275 --> 25:15.655
you both will say some
promises to each other.

25:19.137 --> 25:20.931
I don't know if I'll be
able to get through this.

25:24.655 --> 25:25.482
Kenny,

25:29.551 --> 25:31.172
you came into my life

25:31.275 --> 25:33.241
at exactly the right time.

25:33.344 --> 25:35.620
You showed me from
the beginning what love is.

25:35.724 --> 25:38.241
It is you that has taught me
how to love myself.

25:39.517 --> 25:41.620
And made me a more
confident person,

25:41.724 --> 25:44.275
and for that, I am
more than thankful.

25:45.724 --> 25:48.103
I pledge to commit
myself to our family,

25:48.206 --> 25:50.551
and the good I know
will grow from it.

25:50.655 --> 25:52.965
I promise this all
to you for eternity.

25:59.310 --> 26:00.689
Armando,

26:01.862 --> 26:03.551
today I stand before you

26:04.344 --> 26:05.862
the luckiest man on earth.

26:08.206 --> 26:10.931
I have the support
and love of my children,

26:11.034 --> 26:13.241
I have the man of my dreams,

26:13.344 --> 26:16.034
and I have never felt
so loved in all my life.

26:18.448 --> 26:20.034
I chose to risk it all,

26:20.689 --> 26:22.241
leaving all I've known,

26:22.344 --> 26:23.310
to get to you.

26:24.379 --> 26:25.448
And in the name of love,

26:25.551 --> 26:28.724
I dedicate my heart
and soul to you.

26:29.620 --> 26:31.551
I will show you
nothing but love

26:31.655 --> 26:33.034
until the end of time.

26:33.517 --> 26:34.310
I love you.

26:34.413 --> 26:35.758
I love you.

26:35.862 --> 26:37.137
[pastor] Kenneth,

26:37.241 --> 26:40.793
do you accept Armando
as your husband and
favorite person,

26:40.896 --> 26:42.103
to laugh with him,

26:42.206 --> 26:44.275
explore new adventures
with him,

26:44.379 --> 26:47.655
support him in the most
difficult moments of his life,

26:47.758 --> 26:50.172
be proud of him,
grow old together,

26:50.275 --> 26:53.241
and find new reasons
to love him every day?

26:54.103 --> 26:55.000
I do.

26:56.620 --> 26:59.448
And do you, Armando,
accept Kenneth

26:59.551 --> 27:01.620
as your husband
and favorite person?

27:02.586 --> 27:03.586
I do.

27:09.344 --> 27:10.586
You may now kiss.

27:12.344 --> 27:13.551
[guests cheering]

27:19.758 --> 27:22.241
I will now present you,

27:22.344 --> 27:24.310
Mr. and Mr.

27:24.413 --> 27:27.137
Kenneth and Armando
Niedermeier-Rubio.

27:27.241 --> 27:28.758
[guests cheering]

27:47.448 --> 27:48.379
I don't know.

28:20.310 --> 28:22.344
-Gosh. Don't burn me.
-Hey, there.

28:22.758 --> 28:23.586
How are you?

28:26.551 --> 28:27.689
Just one more minute.

28:28.551 --> 28:29.896
[Ari] This past week,

28:30.000 --> 28:32.103
the lawyer told me that
I need to go back to
Ethiopia with Bini

28:32.206 --> 28:34.103
for his K1 visa interview.

28:34.206 --> 28:36.758
And now I'm still struggling
with what to do.

28:36.862 --> 28:38.724
I'm feeling stress
and a lot of...

28:38.827 --> 28:39.896
tension about it.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.448
There's just so much going on.

28:42.172 --> 28:43.000
[Bini] Have a seat.

29:09.413 --> 29:11.689
-I like welding Bini.
-[Bini chuckles]

29:13.827 --> 29:15.482
Well done, welding Bini.

29:15.586 --> 29:19.413
You know, if you learn like,
a trade like this in the US,

29:19.517 --> 29:22.551
you can make good money.
It's a nice job, you know.

29:22.655 --> 29:23.482
Yeah.

29:26.241 --> 29:28.103
Sounds like you're
excited then.

29:28.206 --> 29:29.448
Yeah, I'm excited.

29:29.551 --> 29:32.034
Just, I want to
go with you guys.

29:32.137 --> 29:35.068
I know. I know you wouldn't
want to be separated from us.
I get that.

29:37.896 --> 29:40.241
But yeah, I don't know.
I'm just thinking about
what the lawyer said.

29:40.344 --> 29:41.862
And she really
caught me off-guard

29:41.965 --> 29:45.413
saying that we, you know,
we have to leave right away
for Ethiopia, like.

29:45.517 --> 29:48.000
I'm not sure if
I want to go with you.

29:58.793 --> 30:00.413
I know it doesn't
make sense but,

30:00.517 --> 30:02.344
it's going to be
so hard for me

30:02.448 --> 30:04.137
after everything that
we've been through.

30:04.241 --> 30:06.000
I'm nervous about it.

30:07.689 --> 30:09.000
When I decided to go to Kenya,

30:09.103 --> 30:11.931
you saw how broken I was,
and I was crying and
I was so upset.

30:12.931 --> 30:15.137
At that time I thought,
I'll never go back

30:15.241 --> 30:16.172
to Ethiopia.

30:17.931 --> 30:20.275
Then now, all of a sudden,
you know, the lawyer says,

30:20.379 --> 30:22.517
oh, you have to go, like...

30:22.620 --> 30:25.137
She just threw this
information at me like,

30:25.241 --> 30:26.586
now. So, I...

30:28.275 --> 30:29.068
I don't know.

30:33.689 --> 30:34.793
That's what I'm focusing on.

30:34.896 --> 30:36.172
This is all future stuff.

31:13.965 --> 31:15.241
I was thinking,

31:15.344 --> 31:17.413
maybe you don't even need me
for the interview, you know?

31:17.517 --> 31:19.137
We can just practice
on the phone.

31:32.448 --> 31:33.724
It's not that I don't
want to help you,

31:33.827 --> 31:35.241
I just want to help you
in the distance.

31:41.517 --> 31:42.965
You want to wait me here.

31:43.068 --> 31:44.758
I don't know.
I don't have a plan.

31:44.862 --> 31:47.000
But I don't have to have
a plan right this second.

31:47.344 --> 31:48.137
Okay.

32:10.827 --> 32:12.310
[Bini] Oh, yeah yeah yeah.

32:13.620 --> 32:16.000
[exclaiming]

32:19.241 --> 32:20.172
Aah!

32:21.827 --> 32:23.758
[Ari] Bini is flying back
to Ethiopia today,

32:23.862 --> 32:25.655
and I've decided
I'm not going with him.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.034
I know it would be better
for Bini's interview,

32:29.137 --> 32:30.724
but on the other hand,
I feel like

32:30.827 --> 32:32.586
going back there is just going
to bring back all these

32:32.689 --> 32:34.758
memories and these negative
feelings that I had.

32:34.862 --> 32:36.586
Take care of mommy, huh?

32:36.689 --> 32:38.206
You have protect mommy.

32:38.310 --> 32:39.586
I know you.

32:39.689 --> 32:41.379
[Ari] So, I need time.

32:41.482 --> 32:43.448
I hope Bini can understand
that eventually.

33:14.931 --> 33:17.034
I'm scared for you too.
I know you're scared.

33:17.931 --> 33:19.448
Don't be scared, I know.

33:19.551 --> 33:21.275
Please set an alarm,
wake up early

33:21.379 --> 33:24.482
to go and start your paperwork
and everything, okay?

33:24.586 --> 33:25.413
Don't worry.

33:27.655 --> 33:31.793
[Ari] There's so many reasons
that I am afraid that Bini's
visa could be denied.

33:31.896 --> 33:34.793
He was married
to an American before.
I was married to a foreigner.

33:34.896 --> 33:37.724
Bini has been denied
for a visitor visa before.

33:55.793 --> 33:58.827
I really can't see a future
together without the visa.

33:58.931 --> 34:00.689
I don't want to lose him.

34:00.793 --> 34:04.000
So, not getting this visa
would be really devastating.

34:07.000 --> 34:07.862
I understand.

34:07.965 --> 34:09.758
I'm the worst, you know.

34:09.862 --> 34:11.517
Sometimes I'm not nice but,

34:12.206 --> 34:13.344
I love you.

34:17.310 --> 34:18.103
Come on.

34:24.827 --> 34:25.827
You're the best.

34:27.862 --> 34:29.344
They better give
you that visa.

34:36.379 --> 34:38.034
[Ari] The truth is...

34:38.137 --> 34:40.103
I really don't know what
the future holds for me,

34:40.206 --> 34:42.000
or us together, or...

34:42.103 --> 34:43.517
in what country that would be.

34:47.793 --> 34:49.344
Right now,
I'm hoping for the best.

34:49.448 --> 34:50.965
And that,
we can move to the US,

34:54.000 --> 34:55.758
but it's beyond my control.

34:56.862 --> 34:57.896
And so,

34:58.000 --> 34:59.310
only time will tell.

35:11.379 --> 35:13.517
[Jenny] His parents,
they said,

35:13.620 --> 35:15.103
they're not going to stop us.

35:15.206 --> 35:17.344
But we're choosing
not to tell them though,

35:17.448 --> 35:19.137
until after we're married.

35:20.275 --> 35:21.413
What, really?

35:41.482 --> 35:42.310
Hey.

35:45.137 --> 35:46.620
-Looking good.
-You like it?

35:46.724 --> 35:47.896
Yeah, I like it.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.275
[Jenny] Tomorrow,
I'm marrying Sumit.

35:50.379 --> 35:52.137
And I'm feeling so excited.

35:53.379 --> 35:54.758
I'm happy and I'm excited,

35:54.862 --> 35:56.517
and I can't believe
I'm finally here.

35:57.551 --> 35:59.310
I'm going to go meet Deepali

35:59.413 --> 36:01.275
and we're going to
have mehndi done.

36:02.206 --> 36:04.000
-Get all painted up.
-Wow.

36:06.689 --> 36:07.517
Okay.

36:09.586 --> 36:10.413
Cow?

36:13.655 --> 36:14.862
You're going to buy a cow?

36:14.965 --> 36:15.793
A baby cow?

36:16.517 --> 36:17.448
Wow.

36:26.344 --> 36:27.172
Okay.

36:32.793 --> 36:34.137
We weren't planning

36:34.241 --> 36:35.344
on getting married in a temple

36:35.448 --> 36:38.344
because the astrologer
told us not to.

36:38.448 --> 36:40.862
But things have taken a turn,

36:40.965 --> 36:43.551
A few days ago,
I got an email saying,

36:43.655 --> 36:45.655
my visa won't be extended.

36:45.758 --> 36:49.103
So we don't have another
30 days to wait for the
court marriage.

36:49.206 --> 36:51.034
We need to get
married right away.

37:04.482 --> 37:05.310
Okay.

37:06.758 --> 37:07.689
Great idea.

37:22.689 --> 37:24.379
-I'll see you in
a little while, okay?
-Okay.

37:24.482 --> 37:25.448
-Enjoy.
-Love you.

37:41.517 --> 37:45.034
I would love to have a big,
Indian wedding with Sumit.
Of course, I would.

37:45.137 --> 37:46.827
They're so beautiful.

37:47.965 --> 37:50.586
All the wedding traditions
and rituals take days.

37:51.793 --> 37:55.310
And we've cut ours
down to about 10%.

37:55.413 --> 37:56.724
Hi, Jenny!

37:56.827 --> 37:59.793
Look at you. You are
already looking like
a beautiful bride.

37:59.896 --> 38:03.862
But my friend,
Deepali has organized
a henna party for me.

38:04.862 --> 38:06.000
Come, I'll show you

38:06.103 --> 38:08.241
-all the preparations.
-Okay.

38:08.344 --> 38:10.068
How are you feeling? Like--

38:10.172 --> 38:12.103
-Excited.
-Okay.

38:12.206 --> 38:14.448
I'm feeling, you know,
nervous and scared

38:14.551 --> 38:17.448
but excited mostly,
and can't believe that

38:17.551 --> 38:19.310
the day is finally here.

38:19.413 --> 38:21.000
I'm so happy for you.

38:21.103 --> 38:23.344
Thank you. And I'm so happy
that you're with me.

38:25.241 --> 38:27.586
[Deepali] Today,
I'm celebrating with Jenny.

38:27.689 --> 38:29.137
She is having a very much

38:29.241 --> 38:31.620
simpler wedding than
a traditional Indian wedding,

38:31.724 --> 38:32.931
[Deepali] Look at you.

38:33.034 --> 38:35.344
...because that's what
the astrologer said.

38:36.275 --> 38:37.620
You're looking like a queen.

38:37.724 --> 38:39.413
Indian queen.

38:40.793 --> 38:42.448
Of course, I want
to be a part of it,

38:42.551 --> 38:44.275
and I'm not invited.

38:44.379 --> 38:45.689
But, it's okay.

38:46.344 --> 38:47.655
I'm really happy for them.

38:49.241 --> 38:50.586
Okay, so...

39:12.034 --> 39:14.862
[Jenny] I know everything
Deepali's doing is tradition.

39:14.965 --> 39:18.206
And I'm so lucky
to have her as my friend.

39:18.310 --> 39:19.793
She's pretty much
my only support,

39:19.896 --> 39:22.310
other than Sumit,
here in India.

39:22.413 --> 39:23.965
[Deepali] Oh, my God.

39:24.620 --> 39:25.620
How do you feel about it?

39:25.724 --> 39:27.517
[Jenny] This feels cooling.

39:27.620 --> 39:29.862
You know, since it's
so hot right now, so.

39:29.965 --> 39:31.517
I'm so grateful for her

39:31.620 --> 39:32.758
but then at the same time,

39:32.862 --> 39:35.344
it makes me realize how much
I miss my daughters and...

39:35.448 --> 39:37.137
I wish my daughters were here.

39:37.586 --> 39:38.551
But,

39:38.655 --> 39:40.103
the borders are still closed.

39:41.448 --> 39:43.137
Okay, so, Jenny,

39:43.241 --> 39:45.620
now we'll do henna
application on you.

39:56.827 --> 39:59.275
But now, only Jenny
and I are here.

40:01.620 --> 40:04.793
I'm really happy that you guys
are finally getting together.

40:04.896 --> 40:06.586
After so many struggles, like,

40:06.689 --> 40:09.620
fighting with the parents,
and like, everything.

40:09.724 --> 40:10.896
[Jenny] It's been a long road.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.724
His parents, finally,
they said,

40:13.827 --> 40:15.000
they're not gonna stop us.

40:15.103 --> 40:16.482
They said.

40:16.586 --> 40:18.827
But you know, we're...

40:18.931 --> 40:21.172
we're choosing not
to tell them though,

40:21.275 --> 40:22.931
till after we're married.

40:24.241 --> 40:25.448
What, really?

40:37.896 --> 40:39.379
We're just scared
that they'll...

40:40.000 --> 40:41.758
cause drama and stop it.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.275
[Jenny] I know that

40:44.379 --> 40:47.758
it's wrong not to tell
his parents that he's
getting married.

40:47.862 --> 40:49.827
It wasn't an easy
decision to make,

40:50.965 --> 40:54.206
but Sumit and I have
been through so much.

40:54.310 --> 40:56.931
And I don't really trust them
a hundred percent.

40:58.827 --> 41:01.896
I am really not sure
how do I react right now.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.655
Seriously, like,
it's a big thing.

41:03.758 --> 41:06.137
It's a big decision that
you're taking, like...

41:06.241 --> 41:08.689
you will eventually
have to tell them.

41:08.793 --> 41:10.551
Eventually, we will, yeah.

41:10.655 --> 41:11.965
She's gonna be very upset

41:12.068 --> 41:13.689
and it's going to be
a lot of drama.

41:14.827 --> 41:17.586
I don't want to focus
or even think about that.

41:17.689 --> 41:18.655
But you know...

41:21.000 --> 41:23.034
What we're doing
is a very scary thing.

41:24.206 --> 41:25.862
And we feel bad.

41:27.172 --> 41:28.793
But if we don't do this,

41:28.896 --> 41:30.620
if we don't go
and get married,

41:30.724 --> 41:33.034
we're not going to be
together anymore.

41:33.137 --> 41:34.241
I'm not going to be in India.

41:34.344 --> 41:35.793
Our relationship's gonna end

41:35.896 --> 41:38.000
and we're just not willing
to let that happen.

41:39.344 --> 41:41.034
I just want tomorrow to be

41:41.137 --> 41:42.551
the happiest day of my life.

41:42.655 --> 41:45.275
I just want to be happy
tomorrow, finally.

41:46.379 --> 41:48.551
I don't know.
What else can we do?

42:08.931 --> 42:09.793
Hey, Corey.

42:12.206 --> 42:14.620
-Surprise, surprise.
-Surprise, surprise.

42:19.655 --> 42:21.034
Appreciate you coming here.

42:21.137 --> 42:24.137
But I don't think she's gonna
be very happy, man.
I don't know.

42:24.241 --> 42:26.482
I feel like I'm in a really
tough situation here.

42:26.586 --> 42:29.586
I'm torn because I would
really like to have
that support from Raul.

42:29.689 --> 42:31.172
He is my friend.

42:31.275 --> 42:34.482
But I'm really worried
that when Evelin sees Raul,

42:34.586 --> 42:37.517
she's gonna be
really pissed at me,
because she clearly told me

42:37.620 --> 42:39.724
Raul is not invited.

42:39.827 --> 42:41.724
I don't know, man. I...
I don't know.

42:41.827 --> 42:43.896
All I know is I don't want
her to freak out.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.793
If she sees you,
I don't want her to be
upset, you know?

42:46.551 --> 42:48.000
Nobody's representing you.

42:48.103 --> 42:49.206
I know.

42:50.413 --> 42:52.758
But I don't want you
to scare her away either,
you know?

42:54.068 --> 42:55.862
She thinks that Raul
is a bad influence on me,

42:55.965 --> 42:57.620
and she doesn't
trust him at all.

42:57.724 --> 42:59.379
At all.

42:59.482 --> 43:02.758
If she's getting, like,
super pissed off, and, like,
things are getting bad,

43:02.862 --> 43:05.896
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave. All right?

57:55.103 --> 57:57.551
The draping,
it's so beautiful.

57:57.655 --> 58:00.172
Oh, my gosh. Look at this.

58:00.275 --> 58:01.172
-Okay.
-Thank you, ma'am.

58:01.275 --> 58:03.344
Thank you so much, you guys.

58:07.758 --> 58:09.413
I think it's just beautiful.

58:13.896 --> 58:17.517
Wow, just beautiful,
just amazing.

58:17.620 --> 58:20.000
I didn't think I would
get this emotional,
but wow.

58:20.103 --> 58:21.551
[sniffles] But wow.

58:21.655 --> 58:23.862
[sniffles] Wow.

58:23.965 --> 58:27.586
[sniffles]
I'm just overwhelmed.
I really am.

58:27.689 --> 58:29.275
Very overwhelmed right now.

58:29.379 --> 58:30.517
[sniffles]

58:30.620 --> 58:34.206
I can't even believe
this is happening.
It's just...

58:34.310 --> 58:35.413
finally.

58:36.620 --> 58:43.517
[sentimental music playing]

58:45.689 --> 58:46.689
Jenny?

58:48.344 --> 58:49.827
Yes, I'm coming.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.655
Whoo, my God!

58:55.206 --> 58:57.551
-And look at you.
-Oh, my God.

58:58.551 --> 59:00.413
Wow.

59:00.517 --> 59:05.620
You are looking gorgeous,
like most beautiful person
I've ever seen.

59:06.448 --> 59:08.827
Wow. My God.

59:08.931 --> 59:10.862
And my God, you too.

59:10.965 --> 59:12.482
So amazing, baby.

59:13.758 --> 59:15.241
[Jenny cries]

59:26.172 --> 59:27.551
Like look what I'm getting.

59:27.655 --> 59:29.034
Look what I'm getting.

59:29.137 --> 59:30.206
[Jenny laughs]

59:30.310 --> 59:32.068
-What a dream come true
this is.
-[Sumit laughs]

59:32.172 --> 59:33.793
This is amazing.

59:33.896 --> 59:36.172
-So you're ready to do this?
-Yeah.

59:36.275 --> 59:40.137
Yeah, after talking
to the astrologer last night,
I'm feeling so good.

59:40.241 --> 59:42.758
It's about us
and I think this is
the best thing.

59:42.862 --> 59:45.275
How are you feeling
about not having
told your parents?

59:47.172 --> 59:48.448
[Sumit stammers]

59:56.241 --> 59:59.689
-Yep, I know.
-Uh, but I'm hoping that, um,

59:59.793 --> 1:00:02.068
might be going to take
some time but...

1:00:02.172 --> 1:00:05.172
we will be back
as a happy, good family.

1:00:05.275 --> 1:00:08.655
Yeah, I hope that too.
I would love for that
to happen.

1:00:09.103 --> 1:00:10.655
Me too.

1:00:10.758 --> 1:00:13.137
[Sumit speaking]

1:00:22.827 --> 1:00:24.241
-Let's go to the temple.
-Yeah.

1:00:24.344 --> 1:00:25.310
He, he, he.

1:00:30.448 --> 1:00:31.655
[Sumit speaking]

1:00:40.413 --> 1:00:42.413
[Jenny] Oh, look at the car.
How cute.

1:00:53.103 --> 1:00:54.103
[Sumit cheers]

1:00:58.275 --> 1:01:02.551
[in Turkish]

1:01:02.655 --> 1:01:04.275
Cats are people. We know that.

1:01:04.379 --> 1:01:08.137
They mean a lot to Alina
and they should be
at the wedding as well.

1:01:08.241 --> 1:01:09.551
[meowing]

1:01:13.965 --> 1:01:16.310
[dreamy music playing]

1:01:24.862 --> 1:01:26.103
[Steven] Oh,
it's a little bit hot.

1:01:26.206 --> 1:01:27.931
Do you mind
if we turn on the AC?

1:01:28.034 --> 1:01:29.379
[cat meows]

1:01:29.482 --> 1:01:31.275
[Steven] Maybe I'm just
nervous or something.

1:01:31.379 --> 1:01:33.068
[driver speaking]

1:01:33.172 --> 1:01:35.241
[Steven]
How you doing Cat Cow?
You're doing good?

1:01:35.344 --> 1:01:36.448
[cat meows]

1:01:37.448 --> 1:01:41.034
My fiance, she really,
really likes cats.

1:01:41.137 --> 1:01:42.724
I'm heading to the wedding

1:01:42.827 --> 1:01:48.034
and inviting our special
feline guests was a privilege
and a challenge.

1:01:48.137 --> 1:01:49.172
[cat meows]

1:01:49.275 --> 1:01:51.551
After seeing Mr. Cuddles
and Cow Cat,

1:01:51.655 --> 1:01:55.034
I was fortunate
to find Mr. Laser Runner.

1:01:55.137 --> 1:01:58.275
So I figured he would be
a great guest

1:01:58.379 --> 1:02:01.793
because he's very cute
and Alina loves cuteness.

1:02:01.896 --> 1:02:02.827
[car engine whirring]

1:02:02.931 --> 1:02:04.551
[in Russian]

1:02:04.655 --> 1:02:09.103
And the wedding planner
was able to find a venue
on the cliffs of Antalya.

1:02:09.206 --> 1:02:12.379
It's going to be romantic
and I'm super excited.

1:02:12.482 --> 1:02:14.310
[in Russian]

1:02:14.413 --> 1:02:15.517
[cat yowls]

1:02:15.620 --> 1:02:16.689
[guard] Just some cats.

1:02:18.068 --> 1:02:19.172
[guard speaks in Turkish]

1:02:19.275 --> 1:02:20.965
[cat meows louder]

1:02:21.068 --> 1:02:22.137
[both] Um.

1:02:22.241 --> 1:02:26.448
[Steven] Hmm, I have
a wedding...

1:02:26.551 --> 1:02:28.827
[guard speaks in Turkish]

1:02:28.931 --> 1:02:30.965
[Alina speaking
foreign language]

1:02:31.068 --> 1:02:33.000
[guard speaks in Turkish]

1:02:33.103 --> 1:02:34.965
[Steven] [in English]
Is there the manager here?

1:02:35.068 --> 1:02:36.827
[Alina speaks in Russian]

1:02:36.931 --> 1:02:42.689
I felt like I had explained
this to the wedding planner.

1:02:42.793 --> 1:02:45.448
Anyways, I think there is
some kind of miscommunication.

1:02:45.551 --> 1:02:48.103
[Alina speaking Turkish]

1:02:48.206 --> 1:02:49.965
[manager speaking Turkish]

1:02:50.068 --> 1:02:50.931
[Alina speaking]

1:02:51.034 --> 1:02:51.896
[manager speaking Turkish]

1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:53.448
[Alina speaking Turkish]

1:02:53.551 --> 1:02:55.000
I don't know what
they're saying

1:02:55.103 --> 1:02:56.689
and I'm just sitting there,
like...

1:02:58.620 --> 1:03:03.758
Please, let these people,
these cats, cats are people
we know that

1:03:03.862 --> 1:03:07.586
into the wedding
they've been invited to.
They mean a lot to Alina.

1:03:07.689 --> 1:03:08.965
They should be there as well.

1:03:09.068 --> 1:03:10.068
[manager speaking Turkish]

1:03:10.172 --> 1:03:13.310
[Alina speaking Turkish]

1:03:13.413 --> 1:03:14.655
[manager speaking Turkish]

1:03:14.758 --> 1:03:16.137
[Alina speaking Turkish]

1:03:18.137 --> 1:03:19.241
[Steven speaking Turkish]

1:03:21.586 --> 1:03:24.482
[cats meowing]

1:03:27.344 --> 1:03:28.448
[Steve] Does that
look pretty good?

1:03:30.448 --> 1:03:33.000
[in Russian]

1:03:33.103 --> 1:03:34.344
[Alina speaks in Russian]

1:03:34.448 --> 1:03:36.379
[Steven speaking Russian]

1:03:36.482 --> 1:03:37.379
[Alina speaking Russian]

1:03:37.482 --> 1:03:38.344
[Steven] Okay.

1:03:38.448 --> 1:03:40.655
[Alina speaking Russian]

1:03:45.482 --> 1:03:46.793
[Alina speaking]

1:03:54.379 --> 1:03:55.206
[chuckles]

1:04:17.379 --> 1:04:19.206
[Steven speaking Russian]

1:04:19.310 --> 1:04:20.655
[in English]
Can you guys hear me?

1:04:23.344 --> 1:04:24.586
[woman on video call]

1:04:24.689 --> 1:04:26.793
[Steven] Very good.
Welcome to the wedding.

1:04:26.896 --> 1:04:28.448
These are our guests.

1:04:30.551 --> 1:04:33.448
Hello, there's Anisse here,
and there's Mustafa
and his wife.

1:04:33.551 --> 1:04:34.793
-[woman] Hello.
-[Mustafa] Hi.

1:04:34.896 --> 1:04:37.482
[Steven] Our families will be
joining in over video chat.

1:04:37.586 --> 1:04:40.793
We also invited our landlord,
Mustafa and his wife,

1:04:40.896 --> 1:04:44.620
the cleaning lady
and also the receptionist
at the place we stay.

1:04:44.724 --> 1:04:46.137
They've always
been super-supportive

1:04:46.241 --> 1:04:48.965
of Alina and I
since we've been in Antalya.

1:04:49.068 --> 1:04:51.275
Thank you guys
for being here.
It means a lot.

1:04:51.379 --> 1:04:53.206
[priest speaks Turkish]

1:04:53.310 --> 1:04:55.965
[Svitlana] If you're ready,
we can start the ceremony.

1:04:57.689 --> 1:05:00.965
I can't believe
this is actually happening.

1:05:01.068 --> 1:05:05.586
I have been kind of hesitant
for the whole marriage thing.

1:05:07.965 --> 1:05:11.689
[joyful music playing]

1:05:11.793 --> 1:05:15.448
But the moment I saw
Alina, I was like,
all that vanished.

1:05:15.551 --> 1:05:21.482
I love Alina
and I am so pleased
that I'm marrying her .

1:05:21.586 --> 1:05:23.965
She looked breath-taking.

1:05:24.068 --> 1:05:27.896
[people clapping]

1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:31.137
She literally looked like
Princess Leia or something
from, wait...

1:05:31.241 --> 1:05:34.448
who is that princess
from Star Wars
that Anakin likes?

1:05:37.724 --> 1:05:40.448
[people clapping]

1:05:40.551 --> 1:05:41.965
[in Russian]

1:05:42.068 --> 1:05:43.896
[Steven speaks in Russian]

1:05:47.931 --> 1:05:50.965
[Alina speaks in Russian]

1:05:51.068 --> 1:05:53.103
You're looking beautiful.

1:05:53.206 --> 1:05:54.172
[in Russian]

1:05:55.137 --> 1:05:56.172
-Okay.
-[in Russian]

1:05:57.586 --> 1:05:58.793
-[Steven] Mm-hmm.
-[cat meows]

1:05:59.689 --> 1:06:00.793
[Alina speaking Russian]

1:06:27.551 --> 1:06:29.517
[priest speaking Turkish]

1:06:32.379 --> 1:06:34.862
[priest speaking Turkish]

1:06:40.724 --> 1:06:42.413
-[Alina] Hm.
-[all laughing]

1:06:44.448 --> 1:06:45.448
Yes. [laughs]

1:06:45.551 --> 1:06:46.689
[priest speaking Turkish]

1:06:46.793 --> 1:06:48.931
[Svitlana speaking Turkish]

1:06:49.034 --> 1:06:50.000
[in Turkish]

1:06:52.103 --> 1:06:54.827
[priest speaking Turkish]

1:06:59.344 --> 1:07:01.241
[all laughing]

1:07:01.344 --> 1:07:02.827
[speaking Turkish]

1:07:02.931 --> 1:07:05.068
[Alina speaking Russian]

1:07:17.206 --> 1:07:19.517
[priest speaking Turkish]

1:07:29.379 --> 1:07:31.275
Can I... kiss her?

1:07:31.379 --> 1:07:33.137
[all laughing]

1:07:33.241 --> 1:07:35.586
[in Turkish]

1:07:41.448 --> 1:07:42.413
[all applauding]

1:07:49.034 --> 1:07:51.862
[laughs] It feels
so wonderful.

1:07:53.724 --> 1:07:56.482
It's been a crazy,
crazy journey.

1:07:56.586 --> 1:07:58.793
Moving to Turkey
to be with her

1:07:58.896 --> 1:08:00.793
and how I try
to sacrifice for each other.

1:08:01.758 --> 1:08:03.413
[both laugh]

1:08:03.517 --> 1:08:06.413
-Mm, I love you so much.
-[Alina] Mm, I love you, too.

1:08:06.517 --> 1:08:09.034
And I think that really
speaks to how much
we love each other.

1:08:09.137 --> 1:08:13.827
And that speaks louder
than all of the arguments
that we've had on the way.

1:08:13.931 --> 1:08:16.206
Can we exchange our rings?

1:08:16.310 --> 1:08:18.206
[Svitlana speaking Turkish]

1:08:19.241 --> 1:08:21.758
[priest speaking Turkish]

1:08:21.862 --> 1:08:24.241
We've gone through a lot
these past few months.

1:08:24.344 --> 1:08:27.896
-And there's still a lot
cut out for us.
-[applauding]

1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:32.206
We still have to apply
for a visa to Russia.

1:08:32.310 --> 1:08:34.896
And then baptize Alina
once we get to Russia.

1:08:36.448 --> 1:08:39.896
But all these challenges
are just gonna make
us stronger.

1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:41.310
[laughs] Ah, yay.

1:08:41.413 --> 1:08:43.827
[applauding]

1:08:43.931 --> 1:08:46.896
And I think a lot of people
think we're crazy

1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:50.517
but we're crazy in love,
so maybe they're right.

1:08:50.620 --> 1:08:52.068
-We're married!
-[Alina laughing]

1:09:05.241 --> 1:09:06.965
-[in Spanish]
-[dramatic music playing]

1:09:11.206 --> 1:09:13.482
[Evelin] I didn't even invite
Raul to the wedding.

1:09:13.586 --> 1:09:16.137
Like, seriously,
what the [bleep] is happening?

1:09:29.517 --> 1:09:30.689
Party now?

1:09:37.620 --> 1:09:38.793
[man] Whoo-hoo!

1:09:40.206 --> 1:09:43.793
We are having
a mind-blowing party.

1:09:44.931 --> 1:09:48.862
We have
the cultural dancers coming.

1:09:48.965 --> 1:09:52.172
These dancers are dancing
to the show music
from the coast

1:09:52.275 --> 1:09:54.620
and from the mountains
and from the jungles.

1:09:54.724 --> 1:10:00.103
We have lights everywhere,
food everywhere,
drinks for everyone.

1:10:00.206 --> 1:10:01.551
-[laughs] Oh, my God.
-I love you, baby.

1:10:01.655 --> 1:10:03.655
-Love you, too.
-[lips smacking]

1:10:03.758 --> 1:10:05.586
This night, it's perfect.

1:10:10.172 --> 1:10:11.931
[Evelin] Mm. It's so yum.

1:10:12.034 --> 1:10:14.275
It's not even funny
how good this [bleep] is.

1:10:15.172 --> 1:10:18.000
My love,
look all the people here.

1:10:18.103 --> 1:10:20.241
They're all gathering here
to support us

1:10:20.344 --> 1:10:22.689
because they care for us
and they love us.

1:10:23.931 --> 1:10:26.068
I'm even fine
with Raul being here.

1:10:26.172 --> 1:10:27.931
You are fine with him
being here?

1:10:28.034 --> 1:10:29.379
Yeah.

1:10:29.482 --> 1:10:33.931
I noticed Raul midway
through the ceremony.

1:10:34.034 --> 1:10:36.931
But it's our wedding night,
I really don't wanna

1:10:37.034 --> 1:10:39.413
be arguing
with Corey right now.

1:10:39.517 --> 1:10:41.827
I'm gonna ask
that you two, uh,
make up though.

1:10:43.103 --> 1:10:44.862
I would like
you guys to do that.

1:10:49.758 --> 1:10:51.137
[glass clinking]

1:10:56.931 --> 1:10:59.137
Oh, my gosh.
What is he gonna say?

1:11:00.551 --> 1:11:02.034
Please don't say
anything at all.

1:11:02.137 --> 1:11:04.172
That's really
what I'm thinking.
Please go away.

1:11:06.724 --> 1:11:08.172
[in Spanish]

1:11:09.965 --> 1:11:11.965
[Evelin] I didn't even invite
Raul to the wedding.

1:11:12.068 --> 1:11:14.827
Here he is, even grabbing
the microphone to do a toast.

1:11:14.931 --> 1:11:17.655
I am thinking,
"This guy is just nuts."

1:11:17.758 --> 1:11:21.000
Like, seriously,
what the [bleep] is happening?
What is he gonna say?

1:11:24.137 --> 1:11:26.758
I'm sorry, Corey,
I'm gonna tell it
in Spanish, okay?

1:11:27.586 --> 1:11:29.517
[in Spanish]

1:11:30.551 --> 1:11:32.068
It came out of nowhere,
I'm so sorry.

1:11:41.482 --> 1:11:42.482
[laughing]

1:11:53.103 --> 1:11:54.241
[all laughing]

1:11:58.758 --> 1:11:59.758
Hola!

1:12:15.482 --> 1:12:16.655
[laughing]

1:12:25.103 --> 1:12:26.068
[all laughing]

1:12:31.413 --> 1:12:33.862
As Raul was giving his speech,
I'm very surprised

1:12:33.965 --> 1:12:36.758
at how sweet and thoughtful
all his words are.

1:12:37.482 --> 1:12:38.862
[laughing]

1:12:38.965 --> 1:12:40.827
It's not just funny,

1:12:40.931 --> 1:12:44.862
it makes me think
that he really cared
to be here for Corey.

1:12:44.965 --> 1:12:47.724
I can tell that he has put
a lot of thinking
into this speech.

1:12:48.482 --> 1:12:50.448
[Raul speaking Spanish]

1:12:51.551 --> 1:12:52.551
[laughing]

1:13:06.034 --> 1:13:08.482
-Raul, that was everything.
-Aw.

1:13:08.586 --> 1:13:12.620
Corey means a lot to me.
I've known the guy
for seven years.

1:13:12.724 --> 1:13:17.620
And, uh, we've been
through a lot,
and I'm so happy for them.

1:13:17.724 --> 1:13:20.068
And this speech
came from the bottom
of my heart.

1:13:20.172 --> 1:13:23.241
When I heard that speech,
I was like, "Okay, I'm happy
Raul's here,"

1:13:23.344 --> 1:13:25.793
-because I laughed so loud.
-I was laughing and I didn't
even understand

1:13:25.896 --> 1:13:27.379
what you were saying.

1:13:27.482 --> 1:13:30.413
-I feel sorry that he couldn't
understand what I was saying.
-[laughs]

1:13:30.517 --> 1:13:33.620
Honestly, I appreciate it.
It was awesome.
I'm so happy you showed up.

1:13:33.724 --> 1:13:38.103
I was really nervous at first
but, honestly, I'm really
happy you're here right now.

1:13:38.206 --> 1:13:40.724
-Let's go dance.
-Are you gonna dance
dirty with me?

1:13:40.827 --> 1:13:42.965
Of course, I'll dance
all kinds of dances with you.

1:13:43.068 --> 1:13:45.344
-Not Mormon dance. [laughs]
-[Corey] All kinds.

1:13:45.448 --> 1:13:48.172
Whoo-hoo!

1:13:48.275 --> 1:13:52.379
Seven years ago,
I never in my wildest dreams
could've imagined

1:13:52.482 --> 1:13:55.275
that we would be here today.

1:13:55.379 --> 1:13:58.448
I have given up everything.

1:13:58.551 --> 1:14:04.689
It's been such a huge
sacrifice and today,
everything is so worth it.

1:14:04.793 --> 1:14:06.793
[Spanish music playing]

1:14:09.655 --> 1:14:13.034
[Evelin] Corey and I
have made it through
so many things

1:14:13.137 --> 1:14:15.827
that would have destroyed
other relationships.

1:14:15.931 --> 1:14:20.620
This night is more
meaningful and significant
than I ever expected.

1:14:20.724 --> 1:14:24.034
I am feeling extremely happy

1:14:24.137 --> 1:14:27.103
and just very proud of
how far we have come.

1:14:31.137 --> 1:14:33.103
[Corey] Evelin, who am I?

1:14:33.206 --> 1:14:35.413
[sighs] Corey.
This is my Corey.

1:14:36.689 --> 1:14:38.586
And I am your...

1:14:41.068 --> 1:14:42.758
And we are happily...

1:14:44.206 --> 1:14:47.241
He is my husband
and we are happily married.

1:14:47.344 --> 1:14:48.586
Yay.

1:14:48.689 --> 1:14:49.896
See, it wasn't that hard.

1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:51.482
Take that win.
And I'm not just saying it.

1:14:51.586 --> 1:14:52.793
I'll take it.

1:14:54.241 --> 1:14:56.517

-[all cheering]

1:15:29.275 --> 1:15:31.931

music playing]

1:15:52.241 --> 1:15:56.482
[Sumit speaking Hindi]

1:15:56.586 --> 1:15:58.137
[Jenny speaking Hindi]

1:15:59.448 --> 1:16:01.965
[speaking Hindi]

1:16:02.965 --> 1:16:06.310
[Sumit speaking Hindi]

1:16:11.068 --> 1:16:12.000
So...

1:16:15.482 --> 1:16:18.620
After that,
we will go on and do

1:16:18.724 --> 1:16:20.206
-the marriage ceremony.
-[Jenny] Okay.

1:16:48.862 --> 1:16:51.137
-[Jenny] Okay, do I
start at the front?
-[Sumit] Yeah.

1:16:51.241 --> 1:16:56.517
By feeding them, like,
we're expecting some blessings
for our future.

1:17:00.413 --> 1:17:01.655
[Jenny] Hello!

1:17:01.758 --> 1:17:03.517
-Hello. Hi.
-[Jenny chuckles]

1:17:03.620 --> 1:17:08.000
So Sumit tells me that
they are like Gods, and so...

1:17:08.103 --> 1:17:10.034
you want to make sure
their bellies are full.

1:17:10.862 --> 1:17:12.000
-Enough.
-[Jenny] Okay.

1:17:12.103 --> 1:17:13.793
-Nothing else?
-No.

1:17:13.896 --> 1:17:20.000
Now take this food, and you're
gonna put one of each thing
on their leaf.

1:17:20.103 --> 1:17:22.413
[chuckling] It's not a plate.
It's like, a leaf.

1:17:22.517 --> 1:17:23.620
Roti?

1:17:24.758 --> 1:17:25.793
Rice?

1:17:27.482 --> 1:17:31.689
I don't know what I'm doing.
I'm just following Sumit
and doing what he's doing.

1:17:32.413 --> 1:17:33.931
[Sumit] Oh,
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny.

1:17:34.034 --> 1:17:35.000
[Jenny] Huh?

1:17:35.103 --> 1:17:36.620
[Sumit speaking]

1:17:36.724 --> 1:17:37.896
Oh, no!

1:17:38.758 --> 1:17:41.172
I'm just so sorry!

1:17:41.275 --> 1:17:43.379
-[Brahmin] It's not bad.
-[Jenny] I'm so sorry!

1:17:44.275 --> 1:17:45.758
I'm very sorry.

1:17:52.793 --> 1:17:54.965
It's not like I did it
on purpose.

1:17:55.068 --> 1:17:58.448
That was an accident.
I... I didn't do it
intentionally.

1:17:58.551 --> 1:18:00.620
[chuckles nervously]
Very sorry.

1:18:02.448 --> 1:18:04.896
In the ancient time, if you
did that kind of thing, like,

1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:07.379
it will make you
something else, like a...

1:18:07.482 --> 1:18:08.896
He'll make me something else?

1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:11.655
Yeah, by cursing you and...

1:18:11.758 --> 1:18:13.655
Make you animal, or something.

1:18:16.620 --> 1:18:18.068
[Jenny] Okay,
so now what's next?

1:18:18.172 --> 1:18:21.758
[Sumit speaking]

1:18:21.862 --> 1:18:22.896
-[Jenny] Okay.
-[Sumit] Yeah.

1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:24.586
[Jenny speaking]

1:18:25.137 --> 1:18:27.275
[Sumit speaking]

1:18:27.379 --> 1:18:28.275
[Jenny laughs]

1:18:33.551 --> 1:18:37.620
[Jenny] So many things have
happened in our relationship
to stop our marriage.

1:18:37.724 --> 1:18:40.827
And I didn't think
it would ever happen.

1:18:40.931 --> 1:18:42.758
But we're finally here.

1:18:42.862 --> 1:18:45.000
And I'm so happy,
and I'm so excited.

1:18:45.103 --> 1:18:46.827
Let's get married! [claps]

1:18:48.448 --> 1:18:50.000
[man speaking]

1:18:50.103 --> 1:18:51.000

1:18:54.034 --> 1:18:55.793
[Jenny speaking Hindi]

1:18:57.034 --> 1:18:58.448
[Jenny laughs]

1:19:37.068 --> 1:19:39.068
[priest chanting]

1:19:44.724 --> 1:19:45.896
[clapping]

1:19:51.758 --> 1:19:53.000
[crowd clapping]

1:19:58.448 --> 1:20:00.344
[man speaking]

1:20:02.137 --> 1:20:05.448
[Sumit] By donating the calf
to the priest, we are hoping

1:20:05.551 --> 1:20:10.551
that all the bad elements
which may come into our life
in future will go away.

1:20:44.344 --> 1:20:45.241
[priest] "I willingly..."

1:20:45.344 --> 1:20:46.241
[both] I willingly...

1:20:46.344 --> 1:20:47.137
[priest] "accept..."

1:20:47.241 --> 1:20:48.482
[both] accept...

1:20:48.586 --> 1:20:51.310
You say "Jenny,"
and you say "Sumit."

1:20:51.413 --> 1:20:52.620
-Jenny.
-Sumit.

1:20:52.724 --> 1:20:54.482
[priest speaking]

1:20:54.586 --> 1:20:55.965
[both] as my life partner.

1:20:56.068 --> 1:20:56.896
[priest] "I promise..."

1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:58.344
[both] I promise...

1:20:58.448 --> 1:21:00.827
-"our two hearts...
-[both] our two hearts...

1:21:00.931 --> 1:21:02.206
-"will be..."
-[both] will be...

1:21:02.310 --> 1:21:04.068
-[priest] "peaceful...'
-[both] peaceful...

1:21:04.172 --> 1:21:06.793
-[priest] "and united,"
-[both] and united,

1:21:06.896 --> 1:21:08.517
"like two different waters..."

1:21:08.620 --> 1:21:10.206
[both] like two
different waters...

1:21:10.310 --> 1:21:11.655
"mixed in one."

1:21:11.758 --> 1:21:13.137
[both] mixed in one.

1:21:13.965 --> 1:21:16.000
[speaking Hindi]

1:21:22.931 --> 1:21:27.137
From Jenny's scarf to my scarf
it's just... a sign of,
that now

1:21:27.241 --> 1:21:28.724
we are connected
with each other.

1:21:28.827 --> 1:21:31.482
Connected not just
by the scarves are connected,

1:21:31.586 --> 1:21:33.413
by soul and for life.

1:21:33.517 --> 1:21:35.206
Please take round clockwise.

1:21:35.310 --> 1:21:37.275
What if I trip over my skirt?

1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:39.586
[Sumit] Come!

1:21:39.689 --> 1:21:42.034
[Jenny] We walk around
the fire four times.

1:21:42.137 --> 1:21:44.413
[Sumit] We are taking pledge

1:21:44.517 --> 1:21:48.586
that we will stay together,
we, uh, keep loving
each other.

1:21:48.689 --> 1:21:51.137
So we listen to each other,
understand each other,

1:21:51.241 --> 1:21:54.379
and never disrespect
each other.

1:21:54.965 --> 1:21:56.206
[priest chants]

1:21:56.310 --> 1:21:59.655
[Sumit speaking]

1:21:59.758 --> 1:22:00.965
Connected for life.

1:22:01.965 --> 1:22:03.000
Sounds good.

1:22:04.551 --> 1:22:08.896
[priest] So you both
have to take seven steps.

1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:11.862
Without this, Indian marriage
is incomplete.

1:22:11.965 --> 1:22:12.965
Okay.

1:22:13.068 --> 1:22:14.517
[priest chants]

1:22:18.689 --> 1:22:20.793
[priest chants]

1:22:22.034 --> 1:22:24.620
[priest chants]

1:22:25.517 --> 1:22:27.586
[priest chants] Fourth.

1:22:27.689 --> 1:22:29.758
[Jenny] Each step you take,
it's a promise,

1:22:29.862 --> 1:22:32.172
and then the next step
is another promise.

1:22:32.275 --> 1:22:37.034
And you have to take
those seven steps before
you're officially married.

1:22:42.896 --> 1:22:43.862
[claps lightly]

1:22:47.724 --> 1:22:49.724
[all applauding]

1:22:50.689 --> 1:22:52.206
Thank you!

1:22:52.310 --> 1:22:54.586
Finally! It only took
nine, ten years

1:22:54.689 --> 1:22:55.724
-but...
-Yeah...

1:22:55.827 --> 1:22:57.137
-We're finally married!
-We are married!

1:22:57.689 --> 1:23:01.000
[crowd chanting]

1:23:01.103 --> 1:23:03.620
[Jenny] I mean,
I know this is
kind of a cliche,

1:23:03.724 --> 1:23:08.103
but today is absolutely
the happiest day of my life.

1:23:08.206 --> 1:23:09.206
And my life, too.

1:23:09.310 --> 1:23:10.482
Yeah.

1:23:10.586 --> 1:23:13.034
[crowd chanting]

1:23:13.965 --> 1:23:16.448
[Sumit speaking]

1:23:25.793 --> 1:23:28.206
[Jenny] We don't know
what our future holds,

1:23:28.310 --> 1:23:31.103
but the only thing we know
is that we're happy together,

1:23:31.206 --> 1:23:34.379
and we're living our life
the way that we want to.

1:23:34.482 --> 1:23:37.724
We made it.
That's all I can say is,
"Man, we made it!"[chuckles]

1:23:38.310 --> 1:23:39.517
We're married.

1:23:46.620 --> 1:23:49.103
[Shaun Robinson] Next time on
"90 Day Fiance: The Other Way,"

1:23:49.206 --> 1:23:50.965
the couples tell all.

1:23:51.068 --> 1:23:53.172
Steven, have you been
talking to other women?

1:23:55.724 --> 1:23:59.103
It's better for you to confess.
Just do it. Just be a man.

1:23:59.206 --> 1:24:02.482
Right now, you're really
putting me on the spot.

1:24:02.586 --> 1:24:03.793
Come on.

1:24:03.896 --> 1:24:06.275
[dramatic music]

1:24:07.862 --> 1:24:10.448
We agree more with adoption.

1:24:10.551 --> 1:24:12.724
In Mexico, in our culture,
it's more like

1:24:12.827 --> 1:24:15.482
you have your own kids,
your blood children.

1:24:15.586 --> 1:24:17.482
I don't like
the thought of it.

1:24:17.586 --> 1:24:20.896
'Cause that's starting over
for you.

1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:24.827
This is the first time that
they're not fully on board.

1:24:27.965 --> 1:24:29.793
-Evelin, after watching
-Yeah.

1:24:29.896 --> 1:24:32.241
that scene with Corey
and Jenny...

1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:35.206
Whoa.

1:24:35.310 --> 1:24:36.793
He shouldn't have
done that at all.

1:24:36.896 --> 1:24:39.103
Not having the balls
to tell me that earlier,

1:24:39.206 --> 1:24:41.379
it's so disrespectful.

1:24:43.862 --> 1:24:45.586
Do you trust him?

1:24:45.689 --> 1:24:47.551
Um...

1:24:47.655 --> 1:24:51.482
Not the first person that
cheats in the world.

1:24:51.586 --> 1:24:54.000
I mean, who never cheat here?

1:24:56.482 --> 1:24:58.586
Mimi and Wish--
how do you feel

1:24:58.689 --> 1:25:00.758
about Ari and Bini's
relationship?

1:25:05.103 --> 1:25:07.448
Why don't you guys stop
involving yourself

1:25:07.551 --> 1:25:08.689
in our relationship?

1:25:10.655 --> 1:25:13.827
You always tried to poison
my mind against your brother.

1:25:15.344 --> 1:25:18.206
You are not my family.
I do not want you in my life.

1:25:18.310 --> 1:25:21.413
That...went downhill fast.

1:25:21.517 --> 1:25:23.827
-Sumit.
-Yeah.

1:25:23.931 --> 1:25:27.137
Do your parents know
you're married?

1:25:30.068 --> 1:25:31.758
-Today?
-Oooh.

1:25:31.862 --> 1:25:35.620
I'd like to say hello to
Sadhna and Anil. How are you?

1:25:35.724 --> 1:25:37.793
