00:47.672 --> 00:50.633
[man talks indistinctly over PA]

00:54.888 --> 00:55.764
[line ringing]

00:55.847 --> 00:57.932
-[phone ringing]
-[bird squawking]

01:00.810 --> 01:01.978
What?

01:05.398 --> 01:07.108
I can't last much longer in here.

01:09.736 --> 01:12.947
Now that Chris is gone,
I'm outnumbered.

01:13.031 --> 01:15.408
-You need to--
-Watch what you say on the line.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.957
You need to pick up the eggs
and put them in the basket, Ma.

01:24.584 --> 01:26.002
You do have the basket, right?

01:26.586 --> 01:28.254
-Settle down, boy.
-[cat growls]

01:29.589 --> 01:30.590
[bird screeches]

01:31.382 --> 01:32.717
-Hurry up.
-[squawking]

01:33.343 --> 01:34.844
-[shooing]
-[cat growls]

01:36.346 --> 01:37.472
[cat yowls]

01:38.056 --> 01:40.558
[sighs]
I won't last much longer in here, Ma.

01:40.642 --> 01:43.353
Look, stop acting like
such a freakin' pansy.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.481
Charlie and Mick picked up
the basket last night.

02:04.082 --> 02:06.918
You just be in the recreation area
at the time I told you.

02:13.216 --> 02:15.844
-Mama's coming to get you.
-Okay, Ma.

02:22.892 --> 02:25.353
-Got the weekend roster?
-Yeah, I did.

02:25.436 --> 02:27.230
-What did you get?
-I got the Sunday.

02:33.736 --> 02:35.071
[guard] Move!

02:38.992 --> 02:40.994
[Tory] Wow. That is nuts.

02:41.077 --> 02:42.662
Escapes make the best stories.

02:42.745 --> 02:45.832
We are gonna be looking at
some interesting methods of escape.

02:45.915 --> 02:49.252
[Tory] In this White Rabbit Project,
we're going down the rabbit hole

02:49.335 --> 02:51.796
to investigate some incredible flights

02:51.880 --> 02:53.464
-from captivity.
-To freedom.

02:53.548 --> 02:57.218
In our lineup, two families
who fled an oppressive regime

02:57.302 --> 02:58.553
in a homemade contraption.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.346
Whoo!

03:02.348 --> 03:05.685
A guy who turned busting out
by helicopter into an art form.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.022
-[men shouting]
-[Grant] It's time to get out of here.

03:09.105 --> 03:12.775
[Tory] And the largest prisoner-of-war
breakout from World War II.

03:12.859 --> 03:15.486
[man yelling in German]

03:15.737 --> 03:20.867
[Tory] As usual, we'll score and rank
our six contenders using three criteria.

03:21.367 --> 03:24.787
And our ranking criteria
for this one: number of escapees,

03:24.871 --> 03:27.540
how long they were on the run
before they got caught again

03:27.624 --> 03:28.791
and degree of difficulty.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.044
Right. Now, what is this?

03:31.628 --> 03:33.838
[Kari] Back to my first story
about a mother...

03:34.339 --> 03:36.758
and the classic "18-wheeler
through the front door" method.

03:36.841 --> 03:38.092
[Tory and Grant chuckle]

03:40.220 --> 03:41.471
[men chattering]

03:41.554 --> 03:45.266
[Kari] At 3:00 p.m.,
Jay Sigler heads to the recreation yard.

03:46.809 --> 03:52.565
But he has no plans to work out
or serve the rest of his 20-year sentence.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.280
Check it out.

04:00.531 --> 04:01.491
Got a big truck coming in.

04:02.408 --> 04:05.286
-[guard] He's coming in hot.
-[Kari] On board, his two buddies.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.959
With Mama right behind.

04:12.293 --> 04:13.378
[bird squawking]

04:19.133 --> 04:20.260
[bird screeching]

04:20.343 --> 04:21.302
Shoot the tires!

04:22.845 --> 04:23.972
[gunfire]

04:24.055 --> 04:25.390
Move!

04:28.476 --> 04:30.436
[bird squawking]

04:37.193 --> 04:40.530
[Kari] While the hired help pin down
the guards with covering fire...

04:42.073 --> 04:44.492
-Jay makes a run to Mama.
-Come on!

04:49.455 --> 04:52.875
Somehow all three make it
to the getaway car.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.502
[Mama] Move it!

04:55.086 --> 04:56.629
-[gunfire]
-[Mama] Let's go!

05:01.050 --> 05:02.510
[Mama whooping]

05:02.593 --> 05:05.805
-And Jay flies free from his cage.
-[guard grunts]

05:07.348 --> 05:09.726
-We're clear. We made it.
-[laughing]

05:09.809 --> 05:11.227
[cheering]

05:14.188 --> 05:15.648
Okay, so what happens?

05:15.732 --> 05:19.152
Well, 20 minutes later,
Ma and her accomplices, they got arrested.

05:19.235 --> 05:22.113
The next day, Jay and his buddy
got spotted by police,

05:22.196 --> 05:25.992
crashed their car, they got arrested
and the cruel irony is

05:26.075 --> 05:29.120
that Ma testified against her son
to reduce her sentence,

05:29.203 --> 05:32.623
so now she's in jail for 13 months,
he's serving life.

05:32.707 --> 05:36.169
-So they ended up worse off?
-Yeah.

05:36.252 --> 05:39.964
All right, so for ranking purposes,
how many people broke out?

05:40.548 --> 05:41.549
One.

05:41.632 --> 05:43.718
-And they only escaped for 24 hours?
-Yes.

05:43.801 --> 05:45.428
-That's not very long.
-No.

05:45.511 --> 05:48.681
-Degree of difficulty?
-I mean, it's audacious.

05:48.765 --> 05:52.310
She drove a truck into a prison
in broad daylight on Easter.

05:52.393 --> 05:56.689
So I'm saying points for brute force,
maybe not finesse.

05:57.523 --> 06:00.902
All right, for my first contender,
I'm working on an escape

06:00.985 --> 06:02.987
that is truly one of a kind.

06:05.740 --> 06:09.494
A hand-made craft
built from scavenged parts...

06:11.704 --> 06:12.955
and an epic breakout...

06:13.456 --> 06:16.876
not from a prison,
but from an entire country.

06:18.419 --> 06:22.298
It takes place in 1979,
in an area under Communist control.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.343
East Germany.

06:25.426 --> 06:28.554
After World War II,
it falls into the hands of the Russians.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.849
[man speaking German]

06:32.517 --> 06:36.270
Sixteen million free citizens
suddenly become inmates

06:36.354 --> 06:40.733
under the heel of the military
and the Stasi secret police.

06:43.736 --> 06:46.823
The only way to the west
is through the death strip...

06:48.241 --> 06:50.993
a border zone covered
with searchlights,

06:51.577 --> 06:55.832
trip wires, booby traps and armed troops.

07:00.169 --> 07:04.841
In 1978, Günter Wetzel
and Peter Strelzyk decide

07:04.924 --> 07:07.510
that instead of trying to go
through the death strip,

07:07.593 --> 07:08.553
they'll go over it.

07:09.595 --> 07:13.433
Their plan was to escape by air
in a hot air balloon

07:13.933 --> 07:16.644
taking their young families with them.

07:16.727 --> 07:19.814
This is one of the most insane stories
I've ever heard.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.358
Their inspiration?

07:22.442 --> 07:26.154
A photo they saw
in a magazine smuggled in from the west.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.656
This story is too amazing to ignore.

07:28.739 --> 07:32.452
I had to recreate it, using
the same methods and materials they did.

07:32.535 --> 07:35.538
Everything from a motorcycle
to a kitchen stove.

07:35.621 --> 07:38.833
These courageous MacGyvers
transformed their everyday appliances

07:38.916 --> 07:42.003
into elements they needed
to build their freedom balloon.

07:42.086 --> 07:43.379
And I'm gonna do the same.

07:50.470 --> 07:54.807
I'm here in Phoenix, Arizona, to find out
how to build my freedom balloon,

07:54.891 --> 07:58.227
and I'm talking to one of the best
balloon builders in the business,

07:58.311 --> 07:59.145
Bob Romaneschi.

08:03.608 --> 08:07.028
-Dude. You must be Bob.
-I am.

08:07.111 --> 08:09.614
I need to build a homemade
hot air balloon,

08:09.697 --> 08:12.325
-and I don't know where to start.
-I can help with that.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.037
[Tory] To begin,
it's back to Bob's shop...

08:16.120 --> 08:17.205
Wow.

08:17.288 --> 08:20.416
-[Bob] This is where the magic happens.
-to brush up on the four B's.

08:20.500 --> 08:25.171
Basket, blower, balloon,
and first up, the burner.

08:25.254 --> 08:28.466
-Okay, so this is a modern day burner.
-This is current technology.

08:29.967 --> 08:31.594
Whoa! [laughs]

08:31.677 --> 08:33.846
[Bob] We're pulling the fuel
out of the tank as a liquid,

08:33.930 --> 08:36.557
and we're vaporizing it
in these coils before we shoot it

08:36.641 --> 08:38.643
through this jet ring
past this pilot light.

08:39.810 --> 08:42.104
Dude, the heat off that is insane.

08:42.188 --> 08:45.691
We also have a liquid valve here,
which bypasses the coils

08:45.775 --> 08:47.735
and shoots a liquid flame
past the pilot light.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.114
[Tory] That's what I'm gonna have to do,

08:52.198 --> 08:53.950
because that's what they used
for the freedom balloon.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.910
That was really the burners
of that era.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.830
-Fire!
-[Tory] Liquid fuel burner it is.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.415
-Should we light both?
-No.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.960
[Tory] But that's only half the story.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.087
When you're inflating a hot air balloon,

09:06.170 --> 09:08.923
you can't just blow hot air
into the empty envelope?

09:09.006 --> 09:12.426
You fill it with cold air first,
which we do with this purpose-built fan.

09:12.510 --> 09:15.429
It's pretty straightforward,
you have your prop, your engine.

09:15.513 --> 09:18.391
[Bob] Runs for about 15 minutes,
then the balloon's full of air.

09:19.016 --> 09:22.103
[Tory] Sounds easy enough,
until you remember the Stasi

09:22.186 --> 09:23.980
are breathing down your neck.

09:24.063 --> 09:26.190
So, what about the basket?

09:26.274 --> 09:29.277
Traditionally, they're woven from wicker.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.446
Flexible, strong
and, most importantly, light.

09:32.530 --> 09:35.241
Weave it, about four inches at a time,
takes about six to eight weeks.

09:36.033 --> 09:38.995
[Tory]
Günter had neither the time nor materials.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.497
He had to improvise. So will I.

09:41.998 --> 09:45.334
Last, but not least, the balloon,
or canopy.

09:45.418 --> 09:49.130
-This is ripstop nylon.
-Wow. That seems pretty strong.

09:49.213 --> 09:52.091
[Tory] Modern nylon is heat resistant
and tough.

09:52.174 --> 09:57.138
Günter had to source and sew
over 19,000 square feet of fabric

09:57.221 --> 09:59.849
to make a canopy big enough
for eight people.

10:01.934 --> 10:04.145
-That's how we put balloons together.
-It's strong.

10:04.228 --> 10:05.896
-This is not coming apart.
-No.

10:07.523 --> 10:09.775
I've seen all the components
I've gotta make.

10:12.028 --> 10:15.114
Now let's see
how they all come together.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.033
How do we inflate this?

10:17.617 --> 10:19.368
[Bob]
I'm gonna teach you to use the burner.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.786
And you'll stand the balloon up.

10:21.412 --> 10:24.624
[Tory] First, we three-quarter fill
the balloon with cold air.

10:25.541 --> 10:26.751
Then apply the burner.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.004
[Tory] This is so cool.

10:31.088 --> 10:33.257
As the trapped air heats up...

10:33.341 --> 10:35.926
-Look, it's going up.
-the canopy rises

10:37.928 --> 10:41.932
So it takes about 10 minutes to fill these
hot air balloons before they start flying.

10:42.016 --> 10:44.101
Now, that might not seem like
a lot of time...

10:44.185 --> 10:45.728
-We getting in?
-[Bob] Come on in.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.396
[Tory] but when you're trying to escape,

10:47.480 --> 10:50.650
and your life is on the line,
that could seem like an eternity.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.944
You know, this is my first balloon ride.
Let's get it up in the air.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.576
-We're untethered. This is it, we're gone.
-We're flying.

11:00.660 --> 11:04.080
[Bob] The airsickness bag
is over the edge, by the way.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.457
[Tory] Once you're up,
you're at the mercy of the wind.

11:09.669 --> 11:13.005
For the two escaping families,
freedom lay to the west.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.175
These guys were doing this at night,
eight people.

11:16.258 --> 11:17.676
Four of them were children.

11:17.760 --> 11:22.556
We have a modern basket, a modern
balloon, and it's still very dangerous.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.184
This is such an incredible story.

11:26.936 --> 11:30.690
[Tory] I've had a taste of flying.
Now for the real challenge.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.024
To freedom!

11:32.274 --> 11:35.528
To rebuild that freedom balloon
using the exact same specs

11:35.611 --> 11:38.406
and materials as the original.

11:39.824 --> 11:42.868
This is the actual balloon,
and what's even better

11:42.952 --> 11:45.121
is I have one of the guys
who made it on the line.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.414
[beeping]

11:46.497 --> 11:48.165
-Hi, Günter.
-Hello, Tory.

11:48.249 --> 11:52.002
Now, it's amazing that you were able
to build a hot air balloon from scratch,

11:52.086 --> 11:56.298
but what's even crazier to me is that
you knew nothing about them, right?

11:56.382 --> 11:57.633
[Günter] We knew nothing at all.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.761
Of course, I completely underestimated
the challenge at the time.

12:02.471 --> 12:05.808
[Tory] Seems like we're in the same boat,
or basket.

12:05.891 --> 12:08.060
If you build it, they will be free.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.812
And that's where I'm starting.

12:09.895 --> 12:12.940
The basket had to carry four adults
and four children,

12:13.774 --> 12:16.861
and Günter had to use
whatever materials he could find.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.489
[Günter] We were clear that the one
we had seen in the magazine,

12:20.573 --> 12:24.243
the one real hot air balloon pilots used,
wouldn't be an option for us.

12:24.326 --> 12:27.746
We knew it had to be
a very lightweight platform instead.

12:27.830 --> 12:31.417
It was a simple design,
and they only used metal, wood and rope.

12:34.044 --> 12:37.506
It's a scary reminder of
just how desperate they were to escape.

12:38.257 --> 12:42.470
6,500 feet in the air, in this.
And it's tiny.

12:42.970 --> 12:46.265
How did eight people fit
in such a small space?

12:47.183 --> 12:48.851
We don't even have the tanks in yet.

12:49.810 --> 12:51.604
And speaking of the fuel tanks...

12:51.687 --> 12:54.398
An important element
to the build is the burner.

12:54.482 --> 12:57.860
Now, the torch is what heats up the air
and causes the balloon to rise.

13:03.199 --> 13:06.660
Now, you gotta remember,
all they had was some propane tanks,

13:06.744 --> 13:08.162
some gas pipes and hoses.

13:08.245 --> 13:11.832
They even used a chunk of
their stovepipe to make the build.

13:15.294 --> 13:18.881
For the first attempt, I just put
the gas bottle on the kitchen table,

13:18.964 --> 13:22.051
connected an oven pipe to it,
opened the valve, and it worked.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.805
[Tory] With the most basic of burners

13:26.889 --> 13:30.059
MacGyvered and installed,
it's time for a test run.

13:30.142 --> 13:33.312
But here our hot air escapees
hit a roadblock.

13:34.980 --> 13:38.609
When they first assembled it, they had
the propane tank standing upright.

13:38.692 --> 13:39.860
This is what they discovered.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.615
See how big this flame is?

13:44.698 --> 13:48.285
It still wasn't hot enough
to get the hot air balloon to rise.

13:48.369 --> 13:52.373
So they came up with a simple
but ingenious hack.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.792
They flipped the tanks upside down.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.919
It actually gave them more pressure,

13:57.002 --> 13:59.088
which eventually gave them a bigger flame.

14:00.881 --> 14:02.132
It gave them this.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.759
[fire roaring]

14:05.261 --> 14:07.304
Whoo-hoo!

14:07.388 --> 14:13.185
I cannot imagine how eight people
would be able to stand this much heat.

14:13.894 --> 14:19.149
We've got the basket and the burner,
but I still need a balloon and a blower.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.403
Whoo!

14:22.945 --> 14:24.905
Holy-- That's hot.

14:25.072 --> 14:27.533
How on earth am I gonna get this to fly?

14:28.784 --> 14:31.620
[Grant] We're presenting our contenders
for greatest jailbreak.

14:33.664 --> 14:36.292
And I've got one that could beat them all.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.295
A French escape that combines
audacity, technology

14:39.378 --> 14:41.839
and above all, clockwork precision.

14:44.675 --> 14:49.138
In Cannes, on the French south coast,
revelers celebrate Bastille Day.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.932
[singing in French]

14:52.016 --> 14:56.854
A national holiday to mark the start
of the French Revolution in 1789,

14:56.937 --> 14:59.732
when a crowd stormed a jail
and freed the prisoners.

15:02.776 --> 15:07.656
Close by, in Grasse prison,
high-security convicts are locked down.

15:13.537 --> 15:15.205
[door buzzes]

15:15.956 --> 15:18.751
In the isolation wing,
guards begin the food round.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.169
[door buzzes]

15:27.760 --> 15:31.221
One inmate,
in prison for murder since 1997,

15:31.305 --> 15:33.474
prepares to turn in for the night.

15:36.310 --> 15:39.063
So it looks like escape
is the last thing on his mind.

15:43.150 --> 15:47.905
This is Pascal Payet.
He's about to break himself out of jail.

15:48.822 --> 15:52.326
And this jailbreak is gonna take
just under 10 minutes.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.959
[Grant] Two and a half miles
to the south,

16:00.042 --> 16:03.128
it's a regular Bastille Day
at Azur Helicopters.

16:03.379 --> 16:07.049
Staff deal with tourist bookings,
while pilot Herve Rougier

16:07.132 --> 16:11.512
watches the celebrations on television,
and waits for his next clients to arrive.

16:11.595 --> 16:13.555
[marching band playing over TV]

16:18.769 --> 16:21.188
[marching band playing over TV]

16:21.271 --> 16:23.983
What they didn't know
is that they were about to become part

16:24.066 --> 16:27.861
of an elaborate plan
organized by a man who holds the record

16:27.945 --> 16:31.699
for engineering the most prison escapes
via helicopter.

16:32.658 --> 16:35.619
Payet's already masterminded
two such escapes.

16:35.703 --> 16:40.207
Last caught in 2003,
his third is almost underway.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.044
[in French] Who's the pilot?

16:44.128 --> 16:45.379
-Are you the pilot?
-[man speaking French]

16:47.756 --> 16:48.841
[man speaking French]

16:51.301 --> 16:53.971
[Grant] At precisely 6:25 p.m.,

16:54.054 --> 16:56.557
the chopper's airborne,
and it's on the way.

16:59.810 --> 17:03.147
It's important for them
to fly at low altitude,

17:03.230 --> 17:05.441
so that they don't show up
on anybody's radar.

17:05.983 --> 17:09.194
[speaking French]

17:09.778 --> 17:11.613
They haven't filed a flight plan,

17:11.697 --> 17:13.949
and they sure as hell
don't have permission to do this.

17:16.577 --> 17:19.288
And everything is precisely timed.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.999
This happens right at a shift change
for the guards.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.460
And since it's a major holiday,

17:24.960 --> 17:27.087
nobody's expecting
anything's gonna go wrong.

17:29.631 --> 17:34.470
As the new shift comes on duty,
the guards are momentarily distracted.

17:36.930 --> 17:39.725
In his cell, Payet is on high alert.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.230
[speaking French]

18:01.497 --> 18:02.706
This is incredible.

18:02.790 --> 18:03.957
In just five minutes,

18:04.041 --> 18:06.752
this crew has not only managed
to hijack a helicopter,

18:06.835 --> 18:10.130
but they've flown it and landed it
on the roof of the prison

18:10.214 --> 18:12.549
and now they're going in to get Pascal.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.936
The guards are in a serious predicament.

18:24.019 --> 18:25.729
[speaking French]

18:26.230 --> 18:29.525
They can't shoot at the bad guys
because it's a hostage situation.

18:30.109 --> 18:33.153
They can only fire if fired upon.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.533
[speaking French]

18:42.204 --> 18:44.164
[whirring]

18:46.667 --> 18:50.796
They're using a gasoline-powered
multi-saw to cut through those hinges.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.840
It should slice through like butter.

18:56.301 --> 18:59.096
The gang knows the prison layout
back to front.

19:06.812 --> 19:10.357
And thanks to the authorities,
it's not far to go.

19:11.692 --> 19:15.279
Now, they know that Payet
is an escape artist using helicopters,

19:15.362 --> 19:17.906
and yet they put him
in solitary confinement

19:17.990 --> 19:19.992
on the floor right below the roof.

19:22.411 --> 19:23.537
[saw whirring]

19:25.831 --> 19:29.501
It takes just over a minute to cut through
the lock of Payet's cell door.

19:31.336 --> 19:32.713
[alarm blaring]

19:32.796 --> 19:34.214
[speaking French]

19:37.259 --> 19:38.719
Then it's a race back to the roof.

19:44.766 --> 19:47.394
-[men yelling indistinctly]
-This is amazing.

19:47.477 --> 19:49.646
In just 10 minutes,
they've broken him out,

19:49.730 --> 19:51.815
and now he's making his way to freedom.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.862
-[yelling indistinctly]
-I think it's time to get out of here.

19:58.697 --> 20:02.951
Before you can say "tighty-whities,"
he's home free.

20:18.592 --> 20:21.053
And that, my friends,
is the story of Pascal Payet.

20:21.136 --> 20:25.265
The man who elevated breaking out of jail
with a helicopter to an art form.

20:25.349 --> 20:28.727
Looks like he ran a tight ship
in tight underwear.

20:28.810 --> 20:30.145
[laughing] Oh, God.

20:30.979 --> 20:34.149
-All right, so how many people escaped?
-Just one. Pascal.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.736
All right, criteria number two,
how long was he on the run for?

20:37.819 --> 20:41.114
-He was recaptured after two months.
-How about degree of difficulty?

20:41.198 --> 20:43.784
This is where it really shines.
Because, remember,

20:43.867 --> 20:46.119
he was inside the jail,
had to plan the whole operation,

20:46.203 --> 20:47.829
hired the helicopter, the gang,

20:47.913 --> 20:51.166
and get all the equipment.
And plus, during the escape,

20:51.250 --> 20:54.753
he ran out barefoot and jumped to
the helicopter in his underwear.

20:54.836 --> 20:57.214
I don't have anybody
running in their underwear,

20:57.297 --> 20:59.758
but I am in the middle of making
my hot air balloon.

21:02.094 --> 21:06.431
In 1979, two intrepid families
decided to break out

21:06.515 --> 21:10.018
of communist East Germany
in a homemade hot air balloon.

21:13.689 --> 21:14.982
I got so hooked on this story

21:15.065 --> 21:18.277
that I decided
to rebuild that freedom balloon myself.

21:20.654 --> 21:23.824
-I've replicated their tiny basket.
-How?

21:24.283 --> 21:26.285
And their backyard burner.

21:27.369 --> 21:30.789
But at 140,000 cubic feet,

21:30.872 --> 21:34.501
their giant canopy
required an industrial-sized fan.

21:34.584 --> 21:36.962
-Look what I got.
-Oh!

21:37.546 --> 21:41.466
[Tory] The architect of the escape
was Günter Wetzel.

21:42.592 --> 21:44.761
[Günter]
I took out the engine from my motorbike,

21:44.845 --> 21:45.929
tweaked and adjusted it,

21:46.013 --> 21:48.098
and that became the air blower.

21:49.683 --> 21:52.185
It breaks my heart to tear apart
a good motorcycle,

21:52.269 --> 21:54.313
but it's all in the name of freedom.

21:54.896 --> 21:58.567
Now I've gotta figure out
exactly how he did it.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.862
Get rid of the seat, the lights.

22:01.945 --> 22:05.073
It's my first time stripping a motorcycle.
I mean, legally.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.491
We'll get rid of the shocks.

22:09.202 --> 22:11.371
Cut the tire right off,
get rid of the spokes.

22:15.625 --> 22:16.960
[Tory] Like 4th of July.

22:18.879 --> 22:19.755
That was a first.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.258
Then attach the fan blades
directly to the hub.

22:25.719 --> 22:28.430
We're basically
replacing the back tire with a fan.

22:28.513 --> 22:30.182
-It sounds dangerous. [laughs]
-Yeah.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.270
-Looks dangerous, too.
-[Tory] Yeah.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.733
So I'm adding a cowling and a screen,
just in case.

22:46.156 --> 22:49.576
Now it's time to fire up this monster
and see what it's capable of.

22:50.285 --> 22:51.995
[revving]

23:04.049 --> 23:05.300
Whoo!

23:05.383 --> 23:06.218
It works!

23:07.094 --> 23:08.387
Now for the balloon itself.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.307
Just as Günter and his friend Peter

23:12.390 --> 23:17.062
turned their attention to the canopy,
they got the fright of their lives.

23:19.856 --> 23:21.650
[Günter] The newspaper, Citizen's Watch,

23:21.733 --> 23:24.194
posted an article
in which the police announced

23:24.277 --> 23:25.529
that they were searching for us.

23:25.612 --> 23:27.906
[speaking German]

23:29.533 --> 23:33.328
[Günter] That's why we had to buy fabric
as inconspicuously as possible.

23:34.955 --> 23:37.833
[speaking German]

23:41.419 --> 23:43.713
[in German]
Three hundred and twenty-eight feet?

23:43.797 --> 23:47.467
[in German] That's right.
We run a sailing club. For the youth.

23:48.927 --> 23:51.012
[in German] We make sails.

23:52.013 --> 23:53.640
[in German] Wait here, please.

24:02.232 --> 24:03.900
[speaking German]

24:10.907 --> 24:14.077
-Let's go!
-Wait, wait!

24:19.958 --> 24:24.754
[speaking German]

24:26.381 --> 24:28.341
[speaking in German]

24:32.345 --> 24:36.892
[Tory] To evade detection, they traveled
the country, buying fabric by day,

24:36.975 --> 24:38.435
and sewed by night.

24:38.727 --> 24:41.396
With the secret police
breathing down their necks,

24:41.480 --> 24:46.735
Günter and Peter had to hand stitch
19,000 square feet into their balloon.

24:49.404 --> 24:51.948
And then assemble a fan,
platform and burner.

24:52.574 --> 24:54.367
[in German] Good, huh? [chuckles]

25:19.935 --> 25:23.897
Our freedom balloon is done,
and now it's time for our freedom flight.

25:23.980 --> 25:26.733
I have to be honest,
looking at that tiny little basket

25:26.816 --> 25:31.071
with those ridiculous rope rails,
I don't have a lot of confidence now.

25:31.154 --> 25:33.490
[chuckles] Are we really gonna do this?

25:33.573 --> 25:35.825
Don't we have historical evidence
that they made it?

25:35.909 --> 25:39.704
This is gonna be fun, 100%.

25:39.788 --> 25:42.123
I do have a fear of heights,
and falling and dying.

25:43.625 --> 25:47.212
In fact, it's so precarious,
so potentially dangerous,

25:47.295 --> 25:50.298
that the FAA refused permission
to fly untethered.

25:51.591 --> 25:55.553
So we're going up on the end of a rope,
if we can get this monster airborne.

25:56.763 --> 25:57.764
[engine revving]

25:57.847 --> 25:59.933
Cue my motorbike air blower.

26:01.685 --> 26:04.312
-[laughs] We're actually doing this!
-[Bob] Yeah.

26:04.396 --> 26:05.647
[Tory] Are we nuts?

26:05.730 --> 26:08.066
I kind of feel like
we're a little crazy right now.

26:10.151 --> 26:11.987
[Günter] The air-blower was effective,

26:12.070 --> 26:14.823
so it didn't take more than
10 minutes to fill the balloon with air.

26:14.906 --> 26:16.157
[Bob] Fire in the hole.

26:18.326 --> 26:19.494
[laughs]

26:21.037 --> 26:22.956
[Günter]
Peter added hot air with the burner,

26:23.039 --> 26:26.793
so that the balloon slowly filled
and eventually stood up.

26:27.294 --> 26:29.421
It's rising.

26:35.260 --> 26:39.806
At precisely this moment in 1979,
Günter's balloon tipped over,

26:39.889 --> 26:41.474
almost wrecking the flight.

26:43.143 --> 26:45.145
Incredibly, so does ours.

26:47.230 --> 26:51.693
We have a crew, and just getting
this balloon inflated is a challenge.

26:51.776 --> 26:55.196
How they did it at night blows my mind.

26:58.658 --> 27:00.660
This balloon, as you can tell,
is out of control.

27:03.538 --> 27:07.334
[Kari] Looks like Tory's balloon escape
will score high for degree of difficulty,

27:07.417 --> 27:09.753
but with three more jailbreaks to go,

27:09.836 --> 27:13.340
who knows which will come out on top
in our final rankings.

27:13.423 --> 27:15.008
Maybe this rare offering.

27:15.592 --> 27:19.596
This is amongst some of the most unique
documentary footage in the world.

27:25.560 --> 27:29.064
It's from a POW camp during World War II.

27:31.149 --> 27:35.028
Under 24-hour armed guard,
the prisoners spend their time

27:35.111 --> 27:39.282
hosting cabaret shows
and doing gym classes.

27:39.366 --> 27:41.618
Seems like they're just
keeping their spirits up.

27:43.161 --> 27:47.123
But it's all a front
for the largest escape attempt

27:47.207 --> 27:49.376
in the history of World War II.

27:49.459 --> 27:50.293
[man yells in German]

27:51.961 --> 27:53.338
And that's just the half of it.

27:53.963 --> 27:57.425
These captured French soldiers
didn't just escape,

27:57.509 --> 27:59.928
they secretly filmed it.

28:00.011 --> 28:02.263
It does not get more ballsy than that.

28:03.181 --> 28:04.516
Let's back up.

28:05.100 --> 28:09.020
In the summer of 1940,
Nazi Germany takes control of France.

28:10.397 --> 28:15.694
The entire French army, two million men,
are taken prisoner.

28:15.777 --> 28:18.947
Five thousand French officers
are sent by cattle car

28:19.030 --> 28:23.410
to Oflag XVII-A
near Edelbach in Austria.

28:24.411 --> 28:26.746
The prisoners suffer overcrowding,

28:26.830 --> 28:32.210
limited rations and bitter cold.
Everything is restricted.

28:32.794 --> 28:36.047
To be caught with a camera
means death by firing squad.

28:38.133 --> 28:42.846
But in 1943,
one prisoner takes that terrible risk.

28:43.430 --> 28:46.015
That man right there, that's Marcel Corre.

28:46.099 --> 28:47.642
He's a passionate photographer

28:47.726 --> 28:52.439
who vows to secretly document
a life-or-death escape attempt.

28:52.522 --> 28:57.569
How he actually filmed inside the POW camp
without the guards ever seeing the camera

28:57.652 --> 29:00.238
is incredibly brave
and somewhat genius.

29:01.406 --> 29:04.159
He grabs a large dictionary.

29:04.242 --> 29:08.163
He cuts out all the pages to fashion it
into a camera case

29:08.246 --> 29:10.999
and then he cuts a hole in
the back of the dictionary

29:11.082 --> 29:12.375
for the lens to come through.

29:15.670 --> 29:19.507
That is literally how they shot it,
right under the noses of the guards.

29:21.092 --> 29:25.138
And smuggling in their escape equipment
was equally risky.

29:25.221 --> 29:28.683
They were allowed to get mail-in packages
from family back home,

29:28.767 --> 29:31.895
but the guards would routinely search
them, so they developed a system.

29:34.063 --> 29:36.983
When the prisoners in the mailroom
saw a package addressed like this,

29:37.066 --> 29:38.401
they'd throw it out the window.

29:39.235 --> 29:40.320
[banging]

29:41.029 --> 29:45.408
A diversion to distract the guards,
the package is whisked away out of sight.

29:46.868 --> 29:51.706
All kinds of contraband are smuggled in
this way, including a stills camera

29:51.790 --> 29:54.626
to take photos
for their forged identity documents.

29:56.461 --> 29:58.797
Now for the escape route itself,

29:58.880 --> 30:02.050
a tunnel over 300 feet long
to exit beyond the wire.

30:09.349 --> 30:11.976
Another thing they did
was conduct their exercise classes

30:12.060 --> 30:13.978
in front of the guys digging the tunnel,

30:14.062 --> 30:17.774
so they couldn't be spotted from
the watchtowers during a shift change.

30:17.857 --> 30:21.611
When the tunnel hits about 30 feet long,
they hit a huge problem

30:21.694 --> 30:23.571
a sheet of granite rock.

30:23.655 --> 30:26.074
Every strike of the pick-axe
can be heard above.

30:26.157 --> 30:28.743
[upbeat music playing over speakers]

30:28.827 --> 30:33.414
So to mask the sound, the prison
drama group puts on music performances.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.500
[all cheering]

30:38.086 --> 30:43.466
After almost four months of digging,
on September 14th, 1943,

30:43.550 --> 30:46.719
the prisoners break through,
well beyond the perimeter.

30:51.182 --> 30:54.978
At noon four days later,
68 men enter the tunnel.

30:55.979 --> 30:58.857
Marcel's camera captures
the incredible moment.

31:05.655 --> 31:12.453
When night falls, the lead man emerges
from the tunnel and makes a run for it.

31:14.622 --> 31:15.915
[guard yells in German]

31:15.999 --> 31:17.709
But the guards hear something.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.213
The searchlight hones in.

31:24.340 --> 31:26.217
[guard yelling in German]

31:26.676 --> 31:29.345
But it's just young lovers
from a nearby town.

31:30.972 --> 31:32.265
He gives the all clear.

31:35.018 --> 31:37.854
One by one,
the men emerge from the earth.

31:39.188 --> 31:42.650
Before the tunnel is discovered,
well over 100 prisoners

31:42.734 --> 31:47.572
manage to get away, in the biggest
mass breakout of World War II.

31:50.575 --> 31:52.327
Okay, so let's score Oflag.

31:52.410 --> 31:55.622
-First of all, how many escapees?
-132.

31:55.705 --> 31:57.749
It was the greatest escape
of World War II.

31:57.832 --> 31:59.000
How long were they free?

31:59.083 --> 32:03.588
Sadly, within a week, 126 were recaptured,
but six made it to freedom.

32:04.172 --> 32:05.632
So you're gonna go with a week.

32:05.715 --> 32:08.176
-A week.
-Degree of difficulty?

32:08.259 --> 32:12.889
Well, they are covertly digging a tunnel
in a Nazi prison camp,

32:12.972 --> 32:15.642
all the while documenting it on film.

32:15.725 --> 32:17.685
I'm thinking this scores off the charts.

32:24.150 --> 32:28.071
[Tory] My next contender,
head of the Sinaloa Cartel,

32:28.154 --> 32:32.075
drug boss Joaquin Guzman,
aka El Chapo.

32:32.659 --> 32:36.704
His 2015 escape from a Mexican jail
shocked authorities.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.915
[man speaking indistinctly over radio]

32:38.998 --> 32:42.418
Here's the police and army making sure
he doesn't try to break back in.

32:45.129 --> 32:49.092
And here he is on the run.
He sure knows how to dress.

32:49.175 --> 32:51.970
El Chapo's escape made headlines
around the world,

32:52.053 --> 32:54.639
and he went straight to
the jailbreak hall of fame.

32:54.722 --> 32:57.100
I didn't know there was one,
but there is.

32:57.183 --> 32:58.851
Let's start with the scale
of the challenge.

33:00.353 --> 33:05.358
In February, 2014, El Chapo
took residence at the Altiplano prison.

33:05.441 --> 33:09.237
It was Mexico's
only maximum security prison.

33:09.320 --> 33:12.657
It made Alcatraz
look like a bed and breakfast.

33:12.740 --> 33:14.993
Overhead was a no-fly zone.

33:15.868 --> 33:19.205
Airwaves were restricted
to block cell phone transmission.

33:20.206 --> 33:23.167
Walls were designed
to withstand rocket attacks.

33:23.626 --> 33:26.796
Armed convoys stood ready
to repel ground assaults.

33:28.381 --> 33:32.301
And high-risk inmates
wore monitoring bracelets 24/7.

33:33.428 --> 33:37.098
Authorities assumed that Altiplano prison
was escape-proof,

33:37.181 --> 33:40.351
but El Chapo and his Sinaloa crew
had other plans.

33:43.271 --> 33:47.275
Since 1989, the Sinaloa cartel
had been burrowing

33:47.358 --> 33:52.405
beneath the Mexico-US border,
carving out over 100 narco tunnels.

33:53.573 --> 33:57.577
By 2015, they'd become
the drug underworld's

33:57.660 --> 33:59.787
most sophisticated tunnel rats.

34:01.706 --> 34:04.667
But Altiplano
poses a whole new set of challenges.

34:05.418 --> 34:08.921
How do you dig out of
one of the best guarded prisons in Mexico?

34:10.882 --> 34:14.469
The answer? You don't. You dig in.

34:15.762 --> 34:19.807
The cartel bought a block of land here,
at Santa Juanita,

34:19.891 --> 34:23.102
exactly one mile from El Chapo's cell.

34:23.186 --> 34:26.105
On it, they quickly built
a cinder block shack.

34:27.356 --> 34:30.443
Now, they'd got themselves
a building site.

34:31.819 --> 34:36.407
They could move men and equipment in
and out without causing any suspicion.

34:38.868 --> 34:41.537
Inside the shack,
they sunk a vertical shaft

34:41.621 --> 34:43.456
just over 32 feet deep.

34:45.208 --> 34:48.294
Then, using pneumatic shovels
and jackhammers,

34:48.377 --> 34:51.631
they started the long dig north,
towards El Chapo.

34:53.925 --> 34:58.012
Along the floor of the tunnel
ran a modified motorbike on rails,

34:58.096 --> 34:59.597
to shift rock and soil.

35:02.183 --> 35:05.394
They also installed a ventilation system
and underground lighting.

35:06.437 --> 35:09.690
Now that these guys could see,
how did they know where they were going?

35:10.817 --> 35:13.736
First, you get a satellite image
of the shack...

35:15.071 --> 35:18.116
and your endpoint, El Chapo's cell.

35:19.909 --> 35:23.329
You plot the target line,
take the azimuth, or compass bearing,

35:23.412 --> 35:25.248
there's your direction.

35:25.331 --> 35:28.084
To stay level,
you use a tunnel control laser

35:28.167 --> 35:29.836
fitted with a spirit level.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.839
Then you just keep digging.

35:34.423 --> 35:39.220
A year after you started,
you arrive beneath El Chapo's cell.

35:39.303 --> 35:41.973
Guided by the plumbing,
you zero in on the shower.

35:43.432 --> 35:49.897
At 8:52 p.m., on July 11th, 2015,
you break through, right on target.

35:51.315 --> 35:55.278
Then the boss calmly puts on his shoes
and joins you underground.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.824
Poof. Just like that, El Chapo is gone.

35:59.907 --> 36:03.786
Now, how does El Chapo score?
One person escaped.

36:03.870 --> 36:06.873
How long did he escape?
He was out for six months.

36:06.956 --> 36:08.791
[sirens wailing]

36:09.667 --> 36:11.127
Scale of difficulty?

36:12.170 --> 36:14.672
Well, Altiplano
was deemed escape-proof,

36:14.755 --> 36:18.009
and they dug a mile long tunnel,
which hit the bull's eye.

36:19.051 --> 36:23.347
But allegedly, El Chapo
got a lot of help, from inside and out.

36:23.431 --> 36:27.101
One, El Chapo
is put in a ground-floor cell.

36:27.685 --> 36:29.812
El Chapo, the head of the cartel,

36:29.896 --> 36:32.648
who is known for being an expert
at digging tunnels

36:32.732 --> 36:34.358
is put in a ground floor cell?

36:35.151 --> 36:40.364
Two, El Chapo's tracking bracelet
was mysteriously deactivated

36:40.448 --> 36:43.910
the day he escaped. And get this:

36:43.993 --> 36:49.290
The prison was fitted with anti-tunneling
sensors, but they were turned off.

36:49.373 --> 36:50.208
Why?

36:51.667 --> 36:55.046
They kept being triggered
by public works near the prison.

36:55.713 --> 36:58.466
And it was alleged
that El Chapo bribed officials

36:58.549 --> 37:01.219
to start this work
for exactly that purpose.

37:02.386 --> 37:03.596
So after all that,

37:03.679 --> 37:06.098
it puts the scale of difficulty
in a different light.

37:07.975 --> 37:09.018
But you've gotta admit,

37:09.101 --> 37:11.062
it's the stuff that movies are made of.

37:17.610 --> 37:20.655
[Grant] El Chapo's escape
was meticulously planned,

37:20.738 --> 37:24.492
but when it comes to jailbreaks,
Latin America can be a place

37:24.575 --> 37:27.203
where they say "no"
to months of meticulous planning,

37:27.286 --> 37:29.914
and "yes" to just going for it.

37:30.414 --> 37:32.375
Example number one, this is Maria.

37:32.458 --> 37:36.796
She's on her way to visit her husband,
Juan, in Mexico's Chetumal Prison.

37:37.296 --> 37:41.342
On the way out, the guards notice that
her suitcase is just a little bit fatter.

37:41.425 --> 37:42.635
-No.
-[Grant] They unzip it.

37:43.219 --> 37:44.762
[all laughing]

37:44.845 --> 37:46.305
[Tory] Juan in the bag!

37:46.389 --> 37:48.140
-[laughs]
-How did he fit in there?

37:48.224 --> 37:49.725
He's like a contortionist.

37:49.809 --> 37:51.269
[all laughing]

37:51.352 --> 37:54.855
And then, there's this Brazilian Houdini,
who somehow managed

37:54.939 --> 37:58.609
to punch a hole in his shower wall
with a metal pipe,

37:58.693 --> 38:01.696
and on the way out, he got a little...
stuck.

38:01.779 --> 38:03.406
[all laughing]

38:03.489 --> 38:05.825
[Tory] That looks painful.

38:05.908 --> 38:09.829
And then there's a guy who
absolutely takes the cake in this category

38:10.329 --> 38:12.540
in terms of creativity.
His name is Ronaldo.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.044
[sighs]

38:17.336 --> 38:20.673
It's 2012, and he's awaiting trial
for drug trafficking

38:20.756 --> 38:22.717
in Brazil's Penedo Prison.

38:27.096 --> 38:28.222
Ronaldo wants out.

38:29.432 --> 38:31.684
But he's not relying on
the power of prayer.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.607
Instead, he's got a master plan.

38:44.363 --> 38:48.784
It involves his ravishing young wife
and her regular conjugal visit.

38:55.916 --> 38:57.835
[giggling]

39:01.797 --> 39:05.843
But Ronaldo isn't interested
in getting his wife's clothes off,

39:05.926 --> 39:07.386
because he wants to get it on.

39:09.013 --> 39:11.474
No, he's getting his wife's clothes off...

39:11.557 --> 39:13.642
because he wants to get them on.

39:16.479 --> 39:18.356
Yep. That's the master plan.

39:19.482 --> 39:20.900
[in Portuguese] It's not gonna work.

39:20.983 --> 39:23.694
[in Portuguese]
Remember. You're all woman!

39:29.742 --> 39:30.868
You're all woman.

39:31.494 --> 39:34.663
[Grant] It's the moment of truth
for Ronaldo-- Ronalda.

39:35.831 --> 39:37.875
Will he-- she make it past the guards?

39:43.047 --> 39:45.049
Talk about a walk of shame.

40:09.865 --> 40:13.619
[Ronaldo in Portuguese]
You're all woman. You're all woman.

40:26.340 --> 40:28.008
[Ronaldo in Portuguese]
You're all woman.

40:38.477 --> 40:39.895
[speaking Portuguese]

40:40.938 --> 40:42.189
[speaking Portuguese]

40:42.273 --> 40:44.692
-[Grant and Kari laughing]
-[Tory] Wow.

40:44.775 --> 40:46.861
Wait a minute,
how did he get past the guards?

40:46.944 --> 40:49.697
I thought Brazilian women
were known to be gorgeous.

40:49.780 --> 40:51.782
What I want to know is
how they confused the woman

40:51.866 --> 40:53.742
that walked in
with the woman that walked out?

40:53.826 --> 40:57.830
Look, only Ronaldo and the guards
know what happened for sure.

40:57.913 --> 41:00.166
-So how did it end?
-Check it out.

41:02.001 --> 41:06.630
[Grant] Ronaldo's out, but now he's gotta
get to the local bus depot.

41:06.714 --> 41:09.592
In high heels, without being noticed.

41:09.675 --> 41:10.968
[guard speaking Portuguese]

41:11.051 --> 41:13.679
Which is where his plan quickly unravels.

41:19.727 --> 41:22.480
It's a classic case
of wardrobe malfunction.

41:27.193 --> 41:30.362
And even though this humble escape
ended in failure...

41:30.738 --> 41:33.282
[in Portuguese] I am all woman.

41:33.365 --> 41:37.995
it surely has to go down as one
of the all-time great attempts.

41:38.078 --> 41:40.039
[all laughing]

41:40.122 --> 41:41.749
[Grant] So, he did make it out.

41:41.832 --> 41:45.961
And here, for reference,
is his actual police mugshot

41:46.045 --> 41:48.797
before the escape... and after.

41:48.881 --> 41:50.841
[all laughing]

41:50.925 --> 41:52.676
That is a mascara massacre.

41:52.760 --> 41:55.596
How did he get past the guards
looking like that?

41:55.679 --> 41:58.557
-They must have been blind. [laughing]
-I have no idea.

41:58.641 --> 42:02.061
One escapee.
How long before he was caught?

42:02.144 --> 42:05.481
-Fifteen minutes.
-All right, the scale of the challenge.

42:05.564 --> 42:08.734
The fact that he dressed up
like a woman and got past the guards,

42:08.817 --> 42:10.903
-he's gotta get points for that.
-Yeah.

42:10.986 --> 42:15.324
I mean, even though the overall
level of difficulty wasn't that high,

42:15.407 --> 42:19.828
still he had to do a really good job of
selling it, especially looking like that.

42:19.912 --> 42:22.164
-[Kari] What's next?
-[Tory on TV] Oh!

42:22.248 --> 42:23.749
[Tory] Check this out.

42:24.625 --> 42:25.834
[Bob] Over we go! Hold on!

42:25.918 --> 42:29.755
We tried to go for our freedom flight,
our first attempt was a massive failure.

42:30.756 --> 42:33.092
The wind started
tearing this balloon apart.

42:33.175 --> 42:35.261
Was that just the Velcro ripping?

42:35.344 --> 42:38.347
But the families that had to escape,
they didn't have a choice.

42:38.430 --> 42:39.640
They had to get out.

42:43.435 --> 42:45.229
This is crazy. We have a full crew,

42:45.312 --> 42:48.399
we have experts, we have safety harnesses
This family

42:48.482 --> 42:50.985
did it in the dark,
scared for their lives,

42:51.068 --> 42:54.905
plus they had their children with them,
which just shows how desperate

42:54.989 --> 42:56.699
and how courageous they were to escape.

42:58.200 --> 43:04.498
Against all odds, at 2:32 a.m.
on September 16, 1979,

43:04.999 --> 43:08.627
Günter Wetzel, Peter Strelzyk
and their families

43:08.711 --> 43:13.257
inflated their homemade balloon
and cut the anchor ropes.

43:15.217 --> 43:16.510
[Tory] We're off the ground!

43:18.512 --> 43:22.474
Four decades later,
history is finally repeating itself.

43:23.642 --> 43:24.727
We're flying.

43:26.478 --> 43:31.025
It's a huge moment for us, but imagine
what it was like for those families.

43:33.902 --> 43:37.573
[Günter] When we powered up the burner,
that was just an overwhelming feeling

43:38.240 --> 43:40.868
as we were lifted up with force.
We were euphoric.

43:42.244 --> 43:43.370
[Tory] That is crazy.

43:43.454 --> 43:47.374
Just going up that 15 feet,
you can feel the lift.

43:47.458 --> 43:48.459
It's terrifying.

43:49.418 --> 43:52.004
This is a homemade balloon
and it actually works.

43:52.087 --> 43:53.464
[Bob] We're flying.

43:58.427 --> 44:01.430
[Tory] The families took off
from the rural town of Possneck,

44:01.513 --> 44:06.226
Twenty-eight miles from the border,
rising quickly to 6,500 feet.

44:07.102 --> 44:11.357
Disoriented, they could only pray
they were headed in the right direction.

44:11.815 --> 44:16.070
Twenty-eight minutes later,
at 3:00 a.m., they crash landed...

44:16.153 --> 44:16.987
in the West.

44:17.946 --> 44:20.866
We're free! Freedom!

44:22.368 --> 44:23.410
This is nuts.

44:23.494 --> 44:27.289
I cannot believe how much courage
they had to make this escape.

44:29.583 --> 44:31.585
This whole experience
has been a journey.

44:32.169 --> 44:33.170
-Good job.
-Thank you.

44:35.339 --> 44:37.925
Figuring out how they built this,
and the conditions

44:38.008 --> 44:39.802
that they were able to fly and escape.

44:39.885 --> 44:45.265
But for us, our motivation is curiosity.
For them, their motivation was survival.

44:47.017 --> 44:50.646
So, tell me, Günter, what was it like
to finally taste freedom?

44:52.106 --> 44:53.816
[Günter] It was overwhelming

44:53.899 --> 44:55.567
because we had arrived in a new life.

44:55.651 --> 45:00.572
That's probably difficult to understand
if you haven't experienced it yourself.

45:00.656 --> 45:04.243
The old life was gone
and a new one was ahead of us.

45:05.619 --> 45:07.329
What an inspirational story.

45:07.413 --> 45:10.999
Yeah, all eight escaped and survived,
and they never got caught.

45:11.083 --> 45:13.252
Let's look at the rest of the contenders.

45:15.796 --> 45:17.715
We've just seen some of the bravest,

45:17.798 --> 45:21.343
most audacious and downright bizarre
escapes ever attempted.

45:21.552 --> 45:23.679
-Good job, man.
-Now, let's score them

45:23.762 --> 45:25.431
against our three criteria.

45:25.514 --> 45:27.516
How many escaped,

45:27.599 --> 45:29.143
how long were they on the run,

45:29.226 --> 45:30.644
and degree of difficulty.

45:31.353 --> 45:33.522
At number six, Wardrobe Malfunction.

45:34.189 --> 45:38.777
The Brazilian escapee scored low
for time on the run, at only 15 minutes.

45:38.861 --> 45:42.156
And with that outfit,
only 2 out of 10 on degree of difficulty.

45:42.239 --> 45:44.825
Number five, Mother Trucker.

45:44.908 --> 45:48.245
Just one escapee,
and after all that wreckage, her son

45:48.328 --> 45:50.539
was only free for one day.

45:50.622 --> 45:52.833
Number four, El Chapo.

45:52.916 --> 45:56.503
He was on the run for six months,
and it was a well-engineered breakout,

45:56.587 --> 45:59.923
but he loses points for all the help
he got on the inside and out.

46:00.007 --> 46:03.302
Number three, Get To Da Choppa,
Pascal Payet-style.

46:03.385 --> 46:05.721
This was a daring and difficult escape,

46:05.804 --> 46:07.931
but despite all the planning,
he was soon re-apprehended.

46:08.682 --> 46:12.227
That leaves our last two stories,
Balloon Escape and Oflag.

46:12.311 --> 46:16.523
And both those escapes get a 10 out
of 10 for degree of difficulty.

46:17.024 --> 46:20.611
Secretly designing and building
a hot air balloon under such conditions

46:20.694 --> 46:22.196
is an incredible feat.

46:22.738 --> 46:26.742
And so is coordinating
an elaborate escape from a POW camp

46:26.825 --> 46:28.160
while filming it!

46:28.619 --> 46:30.871
And you have to remember,
both those escapes

46:30.954 --> 46:34.666
were done with limited resources
under horrific circumstances.

46:35.542 --> 46:39.129
So, with all the scores in,
Balloon Escape takes top spot,

46:39.213 --> 46:41.256
with Oflag a close second.

46:41.340 --> 46:43.884
And that's how our six jailbreaks
stacked up.
