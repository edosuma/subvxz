The smell is stinging my eyeballs.

00:53.553 --> 00:56.139
Ooh, I'm angry. I'm clearly angry!

00:56.222 --> 00:57.140
It smells bad!

00:57.223 --> 00:58.725
What happened here?

00:58.808 --> 01:02.145
Sorry, Zora. I guess our picnic is ruined.

01:02.520 --> 01:03.354
Zora?

01:03.438 --> 01:05.690
The water is magical.

01:06.191 --> 01:07.567
What are you doing?

01:08.193 --> 01:11.362
Come, frolic with your woman, Mort.

01:13.698 --> 01:17.160
-Do something, Clover.
-All right! Back up, you lot!

01:17.243 --> 01:18.286
Move along!

01:18.995 --> 01:21.456
Feel free to help at any time, Maurice.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.793
What are they mad about?

01:24.959 --> 01:27.670
Somebody dumped a bunch of junk
in the Watering Hole, Your Majesty.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.507
Why is this the first time
I'm hearing of this?

01:30.590 --> 01:32.342
Been bugging you about it for weeks,

01:32.425 --> 01:33.885
but you kept blowing me off.

01:33.968 --> 01:34.803
Hmm?

01:36.179 --> 01:37.138
What are you doing?

01:37.222 --> 01:41.309
Oh, I assumed we were cutting
away to a flashback. No?

01:41.476 --> 01:44.479
Okay, then. Fine, I'll handle this.

01:45.063 --> 01:48.441
Peoples! I have heard your angry grumbles

01:48.900 --> 01:51.653
and I promise to find out
who is responsible

01:52.070 --> 01:53.780
for stinking up the Watering Hole.

01:55.740 --> 02:00.370
That's right. I'm putting my best
Ringtail Guard Captain on it.

02:00.453 --> 02:03.915
Yes! Old Teddy's a man on a mission!

02:04.541 --> 02:06.543
Clover, Ted. I meant Clover.

02:06.626 --> 02:11.422
Copy that, sir! Lieutenant Colonel
Sugarbottoms, standing down!

02:11.589 --> 02:14.717
Clover will find out
who is to blame for this

02:15.135 --> 02:18.346
and we'll make sure
they answer for their crimes.

02:18.429 --> 02:21.683
They will pay!
Harshly!

02:21.933 --> 02:26.271
They will be visited
upon with great vengeance.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.689
So we good?

02:28.106 --> 02:30.233
-Yeah, we're good.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.401
I thought he died.

02:32.777 --> 02:35.572
Aw, hun! I was sure this was your time.

02:35.655 --> 02:40.368
I feel like nobody takes me
seriously as a tough, capable fella.

02:40.451 --> 02:43.830
Could have something to do with how much
you say words like "fella."

02:44.414 --> 02:47.876
I just wish my secret friend
Snake was still around.

02:48.376 --> 02:52.380
Ooh, that makes two of us!
I mean, he was nice.

02:52.755 --> 02:57.093
Nice? Why, he was the roughest rascal
I've ever met.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.262
I don't mean to eavesdrop,

02:59.345 --> 03:02.140
but I'm 75 percent bat from the neck up,

03:02.223 --> 03:04.434
so I hear everything. Come with me.

03:07.645 --> 03:09.564
It's pretty nice to finally have

03:09.647 --> 03:12.817
a quiet night in after weeks
of victory parties.

03:13.776 --> 03:16.362
Your Majesty, I have located
the suspect responsible

03:16.446 --> 03:18.031
for dirtying the Watering Hole.

03:18.406 --> 03:19.574
-Excellent.

03:20.491 --> 03:21.743
-Go ahead.

03:21.826 --> 03:23.995
Are you gonna tell me who it is?

03:24.746 --> 03:26.205
Oh, it's Timo!

03:27.790 --> 03:30.043
You really might be psychic, Xixi.

03:30.126 --> 03:33.171
Mind-meld with me and tell me
what I'm thinking right now.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.883
Stop! You're so bad!

03:38.593 --> 03:40.595
I contaminated the Watering Hole, okay!

03:40.678 --> 03:43.806
But only because
you ordered me to, King Julien!

03:44.933 --> 03:47.227
You said we needed to
get rid of the trash,

03:47.310 --> 03:48.937
left over from the war with Koto.

03:49.020 --> 03:52.106
<i>So, I created an apparatus</i>
<i>to funnel it down</i>

03:52.190 --> 03:54.150
<i>into the Watering Hole nobody's been to</i>

03:54.234 --> 03:55.401
in a couple of seasons.

03:55.485 --> 03:58.238
What are we thinking
is a suitable punishment?

03:58.321 --> 04:02.075
Flogging
A public execution

04:02.158 --> 04:04.535
Ooh! Any of those would be
great for my ratings.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.412
What? You guys! No!

04:06.496 --> 04:08.122
Timo's my homie.

04:08.456 --> 04:11.000
I'll go on Xixi's show and take the blame.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.253
That could be even better for my ratings!

04:13.336 --> 04:17.757
Don't worry, Timo, your boy KJ is gonna
set the record straight.

04:17.840 --> 04:18.883
<i>Timo did it.</i>

04:18.967 --> 04:19.801
What?

04:25.181 --> 04:27.517
He forced me to help him.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.312
It feels so good to let that out!

04:31.396 --> 04:34.857
So, just to recap
this exclusive interview.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.902
King Julien bravely tried
to keep you all safe,

04:37.986 --> 04:40.989
but an evil mad scientist
wanted to poison your water.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.907
I don't throw around the term hero--

04:42.991 --> 04:46.411
I do! Anybody who wants to
call me a hero, I can't stop ya.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.330
<i>Don't worry, my peoples!</i>

04:49.414 --> 04:51.541
From now on, I will do everything I can

04:51.624 --> 04:53.209
to make sure the Watering Hole,

04:53.293 --> 04:58.006
is a safe, clean place to swim,
jet-ski and go to the bathroom!

05:00.091 --> 05:01.509
Oh!

05:01.592 --> 05:02.719
This is gonna be good.

05:05.513 --> 05:10.018
I can help Ted become
his alter-ego Snake again.

05:10.101 --> 05:12.145
Well, gosh, doc, is it safe?

05:12.729 --> 05:16.107
It is no more dangerous
than drinking poison.

05:16.190 --> 05:17.400
Sold!

05:18.359 --> 05:21.446
What? You said you wanted
to feel like a tough fella again.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.156
All right, I'll do it.

05:23.364 --> 05:25.575
For the woman I live with!

05:30.747 --> 05:34.292
I hear you folk a

05:34.375 --> 05:36.044
<i>Bon temps rouler.</i>

05:38.296 --> 05:40.339
That was awesome!

05:40.506 --> 05:42.800
All I had to do was throw
Timo under the bus.

05:44.302 --> 05:46.471
Democracy in action, peoples, what

05:46.554 --> 05:49.682
And I'm getting taken seriously
as a journalist!

05:49.766 --> 05:52.602
It's all I ever wanted,
besides my parents' approval.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.229
It's fine. They're fine.
I haven't talked to them.

05:55.313 --> 05:56.397
"Taken seriously?"

05:56.481 --> 05:59.609
You helped King Julien blame Timo
for something that was his idea.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.320
And now everybody loves me more than evs.

06:02.403 --> 06:03.738
-Check it.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.085
All right, we get it!

06:17.168 --> 06:18.377
Do you hear that?

06:18.461 --> 06:21.297
They love King Julien!
Just because of some stupid interview

06:21.380 --> 06:24.634
we did with that buffoonish bird...
Oh, hi, Xixi!

06:24.717 --> 06:26.010
What are you getting at, Clover?

06:26.094 --> 06:29.764
If King Julien is able to use Xixi
to push his agenda,

06:29.972 --> 06:32.558
it may make ruling easier.

06:32.642 --> 06:35.269
We could make citizens feel safe.
Make them trust us.

06:35.436 --> 06:37.271
That sounds like propaganda.

06:37.355 --> 06:38.523
Ooh.

06:38.606 --> 06:41.734
Propaganda. Sounds so fancy.

06:42.276 --> 06:47.365
Excuse me. Pro-propaganda.
A-Propa. Ga-ga-ganda.

06:47.907 --> 06:51.828
I like this angle.
Putting Julien's best foot forward.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.121
-Ooh.

06:53.204 --> 06:55.748
I can't wait for our next big scoop!

06:55.915 --> 06:59.085
Then I have got a doozy
for you ding-dongs.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.379
<i>Voila cher!</i>

07:02.171 --> 07:06.092
Now ya got you a place to store
all your ceramic figurine.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.303
Those are Ted's. "Glass menagerie."

07:09.887 --> 07:11.806
You're telling me that, that there box

07:11.889 --> 07:15.268
full of hand-blown unicorns
belongs to my alter

07:15.643 --> 07:17.812
How'd you put up with that geek
for so long?

07:18.396 --> 07:20.106
Oh, Ted's great.

07:20.648 --> 07:24.026
It's just nice to see
this side of him too.

07:24.610 --> 07:27.155
You must have worked up a manly thirst.

07:29.365 --> 07:31.033
No coaster?

07:31.868 --> 07:34.620
Talk about the ultimate bad boy!

07:34.954 --> 07:35.872
Snake.

07:38.499 --> 07:39.500
Hmm.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.586
As you geniuses,

07:41.669 --> 07:43.963
that's a little thing
we like to call sarcasm,

07:44.046 --> 07:47.633
can see the mango bank has been
cleared out again.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.093
Wh... How did this happen?

07:49.260 --> 07:51.220
The same way it happened the last time.

07:51.345 --> 07:53.181
Your dang parents.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.765
While Koto was on the throne,

07:54.849 --> 07:57.268
the kingdom didn't have
any mangos coming in.

07:57.351 --> 07:59.729
The kingdom's out of mangos
while Julien's parents

07:59.812 --> 08:01.814
are hoarding more than
they could ever eat?

08:01.898 --> 08:02.732
Hmm.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.525
Xixi, who do we blame this one on?

08:04.609 --> 08:06.444
We can iron out the specifics later.

08:06.527 --> 08:08.863
Or even better,
I'll make something up on the fly.

08:08.946 --> 08:10.323
I am a journalist after all.

08:10.406 --> 08:12.408
Making up stuff isn't what journalists do!

08:12.492 --> 08:15.912
And what journalism school
did you go to, Maurice?

08:15.995 --> 08:17.663
-Uh-huh.

08:17.747 --> 08:18.998
Thought so.

08:19.081 --> 08:23.002
<i>Gecko Watch! Friend or Foe or Enemy?</i>

08:23.085 --> 08:25.421
Sources inside the throne room think

08:25.505 --> 08:28.925
there's evidence linking geckos
to our recent mango shortage.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.760
Them little lizards're the bad guys?

08:30.843 --> 08:34.597
After everything we've done for them?
Milkin' 'em and what not!

08:34.680 --> 08:37.350
Boo! Geckos! Boo!

08:37.433 --> 08:42.271
You really believe that geckos
were able to eat all those mangos?

08:42.355 --> 08:46.150
I don't know, but if the news lady's
saying it, I ain't one to argue.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.444
Somethin' wrong, <i>cher?</i>

08:48.528 --> 08:50.488
No, well...

08:50.738 --> 08:53.241
Ted would've made
a Logic Police citizen's arrest

08:53.324 --> 08:56.035
if he had heard something
that fishy on the news.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.578
Snake.

08:59.288 --> 09:01.249
Thanks for getting me the best view.

09:01.415 --> 09:03.709
I can see my King Julien from here.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.295
It is my job to lift things.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.589
I am woman.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.424
We are married.

09:11.968 --> 09:16.430
<i>As you know, there are</i>
<i>no softball questions in the Xixi Zone.</i>

09:16.514 --> 09:17.807
So here goes.

09:18.015 --> 09:20.685
What makes Madagascar the
greatest kingdom in the world?

09:20.768 --> 09:22.270
Whoa, Xix.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.729
Putting me on the spot.

09:23.813 --> 09:27.108
I've been warned
about your gotcha questions.

09:28.526 --> 09:32.071
But seriously, Madagascar is great

09:32.238 --> 09:35.950
because of all the viewers
in your audience.

09:36.325 --> 09:39.579
We're just flat out better
than all the other kingdoms.

09:39.954 --> 09:43.207
Quick follow

09:47.003 --> 09:48.337
This is wrong.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.214
It's just a few little white lies

09:50.298 --> 09:53.134
to make the kingdom feel secure and proud.

09:53.342 --> 09:55.011
Right

09:55.094 --> 09:57.305
You guys are the greatest!

09:58.848 --> 10:00.683
<i>There you have it, folks!</i>

10:00.766 --> 10:04.604
<i>The king's awesome,</i>
<i>and you guys are the greatest!</i>

10:04.979 --> 10:07.315
<i>What else can we tell them</i>
<i>to make them adore me?</i>

10:08.858 --> 10:10.526
<i>To deal with the mango shortage,</i>

10:10.610 --> 10:12.445
<i>King Julien has graciously offered</i>

10:12.528 --> 10:15.031
<i>we eat stuff that</i>
<i>washes up in Junk Harbor.</i>

10:15.114 --> 10:17.700
Aw, he is the best.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.705
King Julien says there's nothing
to worry about!

10:22.913 --> 10:24.290
Be as wasteful as you want!

10:28.502 --> 10:31.297
<i>Today's debate question,</i>
<i>what color is this?</i>

10:31.464 --> 10:33.716
<i>It's greenish-gray, ya ignoramus!</i>

10:33.799 --> 10:36.385
<i>It's grayish-green,</i>
<i>ya old snappety turtle!</i>

10:36.469 --> 10:38.095
Get out of my country!

10:39.555 --> 10:42.183
<i>Seems like the only thing</i>
<i>we can all agree on</i>

10:42.266 --> 10:45.394
<i>is that this is the greatest country</i>
<i>in the world!</i>

10:46.937 --> 10:48.147
Xixi! Xixi! Xixi! Xixi! Julien! Julien!

10:48.230 --> 10:50.691
Oh, I bet your parents
would be real proud.

10:50.775 --> 10:52.234
If they cared about you--

10:52.318 --> 10:54.820
Who needs parents? I've got a hit show!

10:58.658 --> 11:01.077
-Ew!

11:01.160 --> 11:02.620
That water looks filthy.

11:02.787 --> 11:06.332
But that smarty-pants news lady said
this was tooken care of!

11:06.415 --> 11:09.251
Well, you can't believe
everything ya see on TV.

11:09.418 --> 11:11.253
Cannonball!

11:20.262 --> 11:24.809
Ya gone and got the filthy Delta water
on my old lady!

11:24.975 --> 11:27.353
Get on out here and face my wrath!

11:28.062 --> 11:28.979
Okay!

11:29.563 --> 11:32.149
Ted, I really don't think
this is appropriate.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.150
The name is Snake!

11:33.234 --> 11:36.570
Now you pipe down, you snappety turtle
while I defend your dang honor!

11:37.738 --> 11:39.615
This is my dojo, son!

11:41.075 --> 11:43.244
Come on, bring it if you ain't yella!

11:45.204 --> 11:47.790
Why do you do this?

11:50.084 --> 11:54.630
Ow! I'm-a cramping up! And I can't hit
a woman whose voice is that deep.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.884
Heck, what have I done?

12:02.388 --> 12:04.348
Uh... What happened to you?

12:04.432 --> 12:05.433
Oh.

12:05.516 --> 12:08.853
It started right after I swam
in the Watering Hole

12:08.936 --> 12:10.938
but I got no clue what caused it.

12:11.021 --> 12:11.856
You guys!

12:11.939 --> 12:16.318
You're just in time.
Eh, Mort. Something's different.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.945
You get a haircut or something?

12:19.321 --> 12:21.157
You ready for your interview, King Julien?

12:21.240 --> 12:22.825
I just had a few talking points

12:22.908 --> 12:25.953
you could maybe hit in our interview.

12:26.412 --> 12:29.248
"King Julien is
the smartest lemur of all time."

12:29.707 --> 12:32.626
"King Julien's spray tan is so lifelike."

12:32.793 --> 12:36.172
"King Julien might
have invented croissants."

12:36.338 --> 12:38.799
I was kind of hoping
to ask some real questions.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.509
Do I really have to say all this?

12:40.593 --> 12:42.511
Yeah, it's easy, check it you just go...

12:42.595 --> 12:44.722
Hey, King Julien, you are a genius

12:44.805 --> 12:47.600
with a very believable, very even tan.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.603
How did you invent croissants?

12:52.313 --> 12:54.690
But my audience wants real questions!

12:54.982 --> 12:59.195
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
I made you who you are, Xixi!

12:59.278 --> 13:01.947
This is no time to be going off script.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.116
Okay.

13:06.952 --> 13:11.499
<i>And when we come back from commercial,</i>
<i>we have got an XNN Exclusive.</i>

13:11.582 --> 13:14.084
-Ooh.

13:14.168 --> 13:16.545
Exclusive! This is gonna be good.

13:16.712 --> 13:19.423
I hope she plays up
the handsomeness angle.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.636
Xixi.

13:29.266 --> 13:30.267
Okay.

13:31.310 --> 13:35.272
<i>How well do we know King Julien?</i>
<i>What is he hiding?</i>

13:35.439 --> 13:38.943
<i>Did he lie about</i>
<i>cleaning up the Watering Hole?</i>

13:39.026 --> 13:40.528
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

13:40.611 --> 13:41.946
Huh?

13:42.029 --> 13:43.864
<i>In what is already being called</i>

13:43.948 --> 13:46.116
<i>a revolution</i>
<i>in home tattoo removal kits...</i>

13:47.034 --> 13:48.786
What was up with that?

13:48.869 --> 13:51.872
Want me to rough her up, Your Majesty? Ha!

13:51.956 --> 13:53.040
Please say yes!

13:53.791 --> 13:56.794
When I went to do a follow-up
on the Watering Hole cleanup, it was still polluted,
even though you assured me

13:59.964 --> 14:02.716
and I assured my viewers it wasn't.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.677
But this is the news.

14:04.843 --> 14:09.098
We can say whatever we want to be true,
and the peoples will believe it.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.433
Look, you screwed up,

14:11.517 --> 14:14.019
but you could come on my show
and tell the truth.

14:14.103 --> 14:16.021
It would be huge for my ratings.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.524
Which would be huge for my self-esteem.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.068
This isn't like an ambush thing, right?

14:21.151 --> 14:26.073
It's important for the government
and the media to be on the same page.

14:26.156 --> 14:28.117
This is a bad idea, Your Majesty.

14:28.367 --> 14:29.910
You worry too much.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.413
Yeah, I mean, what am I gonna do?

14:32.496 --> 14:36.584
Choose TV ratings
over my friend and king

14:36.709 --> 14:38.961
So what Like, I'm just gonna pick

14:39.044 --> 14:42.715
being respected and admired by everyone

14:42.798 --> 14:44.466
over my friend and king?

14:44.550 --> 14:47.344
Nah! Probably not gonna happen.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.013
See, Clover?

14:49.096 --> 14:51.015
You were worried about nothing.

14:52.016 --> 14:54.894
<i>This is a Xixi News Network Exclusive!</i>

14:54.977 --> 14:57.771
<i>We're back with King Julien</i>
<i>who has assured me that</i>

14:57.855 --> 15:00.983
<i>despite the overall cruddy appearance</i>
<i>of the Watering Hole</i>

15:01.066 --> 15:03.027
<i>the water is still safe.</i>

15:04.612 --> 15:06.196
<i>That's right, Xixi.</i>

15:06.530 --> 15:11.535
Sometimes these things just look worse
than they actually are.

15:11.702 --> 15:13.913
Everything's okay.

15:14.163 --> 15:17.625
Then I guess you'd be willing
to take a little swim?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.084
Are you crazy, woman?

15:21.295 --> 15:22.630
I mean,

15:22.713 --> 15:25.966
sure, sure, I can swim in this

15:26.050 --> 15:29.053
clean, non-smelly water.

15:30.012 --> 15:31.347
Very...

15:31.430 --> 15:33.515
simple for me to do...

15:37.394 --> 15:39.605
I forgot my suit.
Mort, you should go first!

15:48.405 --> 15:49.531
<i>I'm ok...</i>

15:51.659 --> 15:53.077
<i>I'm okay.</i>

16:00.084 --> 16:01.710
<i>Huh. Nothing.</i>

16:02.753 --> 16:04.713
<i>See? Nothing.</i>

16:04.797 --> 16:06.507
<i>He's okay.</i>

16:09.093 --> 16:09.927
<i>What?</i>

16:11.303 --> 16:12.763
This is bad.

16:12.846 --> 16:14.556
Success has gone to Xixi's head.

16:14.640 --> 16:18.185
Since when do journalists
hold politicians accountable for stuff?

16:18.268 --> 16:19.895
We just need to fix the problem.

16:20.479 --> 16:21.772
Timo, you're rehired.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.233
Do whatever it takes to fix that hole.

16:24.316 --> 16:27.361
I'll reroute the sludge and garbage

16:27.444 --> 16:29.446
to a place nobody ever goes!

16:29.697 --> 16:31.073
Sounds an awful lot like

16:31.156 --> 16:33.784
you're just relocatin' the problem
instead of fixing it.

16:33.867 --> 16:34.702
Exactly!

16:34.785 --> 16:36.245
Timo gets it!

16:37.705 --> 16:41.208
I can't wait to see the look
in Mom-Bot's soulless dead eyes!

16:41.375 --> 16:44.628
Now I just need to go on Xixi's show
and tell everybody

16:44.712 --> 16:48.090
the king took care of the problem
and I'm awesome again.

16:48.173 --> 16:51.260
Maybe I should do it instead.
You've done enough already.

16:51.593 --> 16:52.720
You

16:53.095 --> 16:55.889
Have you already forgotten how bad
you were the last time

16:55.973 --> 16:57.433
you were on Xixi's show?

16:57.599 --> 16:59.393
Ancient aliens built that, man!

17:01.603 --> 17:05.232
I should be the one to go on the show
to ensure there are no more mistakes.

17:05.315 --> 17:09.153
My training allows me
to be absolutely calm under pressure.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.780
I will relate to Xixi, build rapport.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.073
And if that doesn't work,

17:13.157 --> 17:16.118
I will rip her stupid beak off
and bludgeon her with it!

17:17.453 --> 17:19.329
Xixi!

17:27.296 --> 17:29.923
Thank you and welcome

17:30.007 --> 17:33.135
to the Xixi News Network Roundtable

17:33.218 --> 17:35.137
<i>Showdown!</i>

17:35.220 --> 17:37.347
<i>Where our panel of non-experts</i>

17:37.431 --> 17:41.393
<i>shout their half-formed opinions</i>
<i>about things they haven't researched.</i>

17:41.477 --> 17:43.312
<i>We're live from the site</i>

17:43.395 --> 17:47.274
of the worst environmental disaster
of all time.

17:47.357 --> 17:50.402
Oh, sure, sure, the water was a bit murky

17:50.486 --> 17:54.490
but as you can see behind us,
the problem has been resolved.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.078
I don't know how you did it, Timo.

17:59.161 --> 18:03.040
Well, a gentleman has to keep
some air of mystery.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.210
But a lot of folks are wondering

18:06.293 --> 18:10.005
why it took so long for the King
to respond to the problem.

18:10.255 --> 18:13.342
Yeah, why is our government
so full of idiots?

18:13.425 --> 18:14.927
Ooh, burn.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.598
Idiots No, I don't think that--

18:19.681 --> 18:24.520
King Julien wants to poison all of us
as part of a government conspiracy.

18:24.603 --> 18:27.147
And I'm also pretty sure
he's controllin' the weather!

18:27.231 --> 18:29.358
<i></i>
<i>-He's a tyrant!</i>

18:29.441 --> 18:32.194
<i>I bet he wasn't even born in Madagascar.</i>

18:32.277 --> 18:33.237
<i>-Uh-huh.</i>
<i>-Huh.</i>

18:33.320 --> 18:35.155
<i>Well, where would he possibly be born?</i>

18:35.239 --> 18:37.616
<i>Don't be afraid</i>
<i>to call each other names, guys!</i>

18:37.783 --> 18:41.245
<i>In fact, you got a funny accent too, lady.</i>

18:41.620 --> 18:43.372
<i>Where was you born?</i>

18:43.455 --> 18:45.040
That is none of your concern!

18:48.460 --> 18:51.713
Back when a man could get away
with killin' somebody if he wanted to,

18:51.797 --> 18:53.298
and why can't we do that anymore?

19:00.139 --> 19:01.390
Uh

19:02.891 --> 19:05.227
That rumbling is probably nothing. How dare you question where I'm from?

19:12.985 --> 19:14.319
Security!

19:18.365 --> 19:19.992
I don't wanna wrestle, no!

19:21.118 --> 19:22.119
Get the--

19:30.836 --> 19:33.297
Okay, now might be a good time to tell you

19:33.380 --> 19:35.799
I rerouted the garbage water underground

19:35.883 --> 19:38.969
but the pump is overloading, we have to

19:39.052 --> 19:40.679
shut it down!

19:40.846 --> 19:42.598
Timo! Do something!

19:47.060 --> 19:48.353
Something better!

19:48.437 --> 19:50.689
You mind if I take a look?

19:50.772 --> 19:53.066
Snake, it looks dangerous.

19:56.361 --> 20:00.991
You should definitely take a look.
Consequences be darned.

20:01.074 --> 20:02.075
Get in there.

20:16.173 --> 20:20.093
Darn it to heck, hun! Get up!
Please! I need you!

20:20.177 --> 20:23.847
I was wrong about Snake
and this is all my fault!

20:27.517 --> 20:30.187
Bouncin' Bermuda shorts! What happened? Oh, Ted, you saved us all.

20:33.273 --> 20:34.858
Snake saved you all.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.985
Snake is horrible, Ted!

20:37.069 --> 20:40.072
You're the man I married.

20:40.155 --> 20:41.782
I missed ya so much, hun!

20:41.865 --> 20:44.868
-Well...

20:44.952 --> 20:46.245
I mean, you gotta admit,

20:46.328 --> 20:48.455
he's better than me
in every conceivable way.

20:48.872 --> 20:52.376
I don't want better, Ted. I want you.

20:53.877 --> 20:55.212
Thanks?

21:02.594 --> 21:04.972
Hmm. I have an announcement to make.

21:05.555 --> 21:07.724
-The news is canceled.

21:07.808 --> 21:12.980
This is all my fault. I told Xixi
to say nice things about me

21:13.063 --> 21:16.441
when what I really should
have been doing is being a leader

21:16.525 --> 21:18.777
and taking responsibility.

21:19.361 --> 21:22.656
I'm sorry, Xixi.
And I'm sorry, all of you.

21:22.739 --> 21:25.701
You were kidding about the news
being canceled right?

21:25.784 --> 21:26.910
It's all I have.

21:28.620 --> 21:29.579
Look at us!

21:30.580 --> 21:34.459
Xixi's so-called news
has turned the entire kingdom

21:34.543 --> 21:37.629
into a bunch of angry, uninformed mutants.

21:37.754 --> 21:38.880
Especially that thing.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.590
What the heck, man?

21:40.757 --> 21:43.051
From now on, I promise

21:43.260 --> 21:46.013
that I will never be dishonest again.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.599
What do you say, peoples?

21:50.726 --> 21:52.269
Feel free to cheer!

21:57.733 --> 22:01.528
And through Timo's ingenuity
and Julien's leadership,

22:01.611 --> 22:06.241
we have finally found a sustainable way
to deal with our garbage water problem.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.702
Would you like
to do the honors, Your Majesty?

22:09.411 --> 22:10.620
Ta-da!

22:14.583 --> 22:17.377
But, Timo. Timo?
Where's the sludge going now?

22:17.461 --> 22:20.339
No idea, but it won't be
our concern any more.

22:20.422 --> 22:21.840
Exactly.

22:21.923 --> 22:24.384
It feels good to solve problems!

22:33.685 --> 22:35.687
I'm still in there, Teddy Boy.
