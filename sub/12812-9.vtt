WEBVTT

00:10.740 --> 00:12.298
I know why
the k/Y/eris‘ aﬁer me.

00:12.310 --> 00:13.959
I brought Piper to lakewood.

00:13.970 --> 00:14.902
I can explain.

00:14.910 --> 00:16.605
Brooke:
777/5 cam/va/S; a joke!

00:16.610 --> 00:17.838
Unless we stop acting

00:17.840 --> 00:19.535
like this isn't murderville,

00:19.550 --> 00:21.643
we're all gonna
end up like Jake,

00:21.650 --> 00:22.878
and we 7/ deserve it.

00:22.880 --> 00:24.017
(Microphone clatters)

00:24.020 --> 00:25.772
A lot of people are trying
to help me right now,

00:25.790 --> 00:27.280
and it seems to be
turning out for the worst.

00:27.290 --> 00:29.212
Emma:
I really need you
to give me some space,

00:29.220 --> 00:31.688
or I don ’t know
what I ’m gonna do.

00:31.690 --> 00:33.112
(Screams)

00:33.130 --> 00:34.279
(Screams)

00:34.290 --> 00:38.090
Audrey:
Its a// on me!
E ve/ytn/ng is my fau/t/

00:38.100 --> 00:39.795
Down on your knees now!

00:39.800 --> 00:40.960
Where's Kieran?!

00:40.970 --> 00:42.926
Emma, drop the weapon.

00:42.940 --> 00:44.237
Oh, my god! Kieran!

00:44.240 --> 00:46.094
M/guei:
Where Is it?
Sta V0.’
Where is what?

00:46.110 --> 00:48.032
Where's the mask?
You really think

00:48.040 --> 00:49.029
I carve people up

00:49.040 --> 00:50.701
and hang them up
like pieces of meat?

00:50.710 --> 00:53.747
If you think
I'm a killer, prove it.

01:02.190 --> 01:04.385
(Suspenseful music playing)

01:04.390 --> 01:08.224
Emma, we need to talk.
Emma? Emma, hang on!

01:08.230 --> 01:09.629
Emma, wait!
Emma, come back here!

01:09.630 --> 01:11.427
We're all really worried
about you, Emma!

01:11.430 --> 01:14.490
Emma, we just want to talk!
Emma, we're trying to help you.

01:14.500 --> 01:17.333
Emma, stop!
Wait. We just want to talk.

01:17.340 --> 01:19.194
Emma, we really need to talk.

01:19.210 --> 01:22.008
No more talking.
We just want to talk.

01:22.010 --> 01:22.760
No more talking.

01:22.780 --> 01:24.736
(Overlapping chatter)

01:24.740 --> 01:26.776
No more... talking!

01:26.780 --> 01:30.648
Kieran:
Emma, what have you done?
Oh, my god!

01:35.460 --> 01:38.020
Emma! Emma!

01:39.360 --> 01:41.419
(Groaning)
Em...

01:42.530 --> 01:44.191
Maggie:
Emma...

01:44.200 --> 01:48.296
Overlapping voices:
Emma...

01:48.770 --> 01:50.397
Emma!

01:50.400 --> 01:52.163
Wake up, honey! Wake up!

01:52.170 --> 01:54.331
Stop. Wake up.

01:54.340 --> 01:57.377
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:57.380 --> 02:02.101
No, no, no. Hey...
(Gasping)

02:02.120 --> 02:03.678
Okay.

02:07.820 --> 02:10.414
Oh, honey... it's okay.

02:10.420 --> 02:13.184
Shh, Shh, Shh.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.259
Emma:
And I ’ve had
dreams //i(e this before.

02:20.270 --> 02:23.319
They always end
with my hands
covered in blood.

02:23.340 --> 02:26.468
(Sighs)
But this time was different.

02:26.470 --> 02:30.509
This time, I woke up
in the kitchen holding a knife.

02:30.510 --> 02:35.709
I'm sure if I'd been able
to sleep, I would've
had nightmares too.

02:40.650 --> 02:42.686
Last night was insane.

02:42.690 --> 02:45.386
Audrey's insane.
I-i can't...

02:45.390 --> 02:46.687
I don't want to see her.

02:46.690 --> 02:48.157
I don't want
to see her either.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.697
I've never felt
like this before, ever.

02:50.700 --> 02:53.669
I feel so betrayed.

02:54.870 --> 02:58.192
You know we don't have
to go to school, right?

02:58.200 --> 03:03.433
We could just ditch.
No one would blame us.

03:05.510 --> 03:06.875
No, I have to find Noah.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.142
I have to find out

03:08.150 --> 03:10.846
how the hell
all of this happened.

03:34.510 --> 03:36.239
(Knocking)

03:46.320 --> 03:49.209
(Line ringing)

03:50.790 --> 03:52.655
(Phone vibrating)

03:53.660 --> 03:55.651
(Vibrating continues)

03:55.660 --> 03:57.298
Are you gonna get that?

03:57.300 --> 04:00.622
(Vibrating continues)
No.

04:02.240 --> 04:06.336
See, this is why people
think you're creepy.

04:07.470 --> 04:09.768
Do you think I'm creepy?

04:10.910 --> 04:12.537
Yes.

04:13.580 --> 04:15.275
But you say
nice things to me,

04:15.280 --> 04:17.817
and I think
you smell kinda good.

04:17.820 --> 04:22.484
So, who's creepy now?
Still you.

04:22.960 --> 04:26.509
Oh, my god.
My head feels like cement.

04:26.530 --> 04:30.421
Yeah, you were pretty
wasted last night.

04:30.430 --> 04:33.194
I think I still am.

04:34.970 --> 04:36.289
Do you remember much?

04:36.300 --> 04:37.460
Just the public meltdown

04:37.470 --> 04:40.291
where I called my dad a liar.

04:40.510 --> 04:45.300
I told the whole town _
they basically deserved to die.

04:47.210 --> 04:51.374
Do you think there's anybody
who doesn't hate me right now?

04:51.950 --> 04:53.918
I don't hate you.

05:03.830 --> 05:07.721
We can't do this.
We already did do this.

05:08.700 --> 05:10.736
I'm serious.

05:11.300 --> 05:13.439
Ijust...

05:13.440 --> 05:17.376
Jake?
He's still here, you know?

05:17.380 --> 05:18.677
I just don't think
i can do this

05:18.680 --> 05:21.478
until I know
what happened to him.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.243
I get it.

05:34.030 --> 05:38.455
I'm gonna shower.
You'd better go right
back out that window

05:38.460 --> 05:40.826
before my dad finds you.

05:43.470 --> 05:46.394
I'm serious. Go!

05:46.410 --> 05:48.628
I'm too hungover for this.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.733
Okay.

05:52.510 --> 05:55.274
(Phone dings)
(Door closes)

06:42.430 --> 06:44.352
I don't understand. Audrey?

06:44.360 --> 06:45.691
Yeah. It's unreal.

06:45.700 --> 06:47.395
All that stuff about Piper,

06:47.400 --> 06:49.561
everything that she said...
It was just a lie?

06:49.570 --> 06:52.061
Yes.
Right to our faces,
every day.

06:52.070 --> 06:56.404
Hey, you guys.
Enjoyed your freak show
at the carnival last night.

06:56.410 --> 06:58.378
Give it a rest, Hayley.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.006
People are idiots.

07:00.010 --> 07:01.739
Yeah, you'd think
I'd be used to it.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.479
Hey! There he is.

07:03.480 --> 07:05.368
What the hell
is wrong with you, huh?

07:05.390 --> 07:07.642
How long have you known, Noah?

07:07.650 --> 07:09.709
A few days. I'm so sorry
i didn't say anything.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.814
No, you are not sorry.
You promised Audrey
that you wouldn't tell me.

07:12.830 --> 07:14.821
I thought that she should
be the one to tell you.

07:14.830 --> 07:16.821
I know everything now
because I heard everything

07:16.830 --> 07:18.593
that you recorded, Noah!

07:18.600 --> 07:19.999
You heard that?
How did you...?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.922
someone sent me an email.

07:21.940 --> 07:24.135
Can I see that email, please?

07:28.570 --> 07:31.437
"Secret friend"?
Yeah, it's obviously fake.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.704
But imminently traceable.

07:34.680 --> 07:37.410
Look, Audrey has
just been destroyed...

07:37.420 --> 07:38.648
Audrey's been destroyed?

07:38.650 --> 07:40.538
Noah, our friends
were being killed,

07:40.550 --> 07:46.011
and she didn't say anything
to anyone, including you!

07:46.030 --> 07:47.520
Emma...

07:47.530 --> 07:49.680
No.
No, look, I just want...

07:49.700 --> 07:51.053
Let her be.

07:51.060 --> 07:53.654
Emma, I didn't know
it was Piper!
Oh, my god!

07:53.670 --> 07:56.992
Yes, you did!
You just didn't want
people to blame you!

07:57.000 --> 07:59.468
That is not true!
It is! It is true!

07:59.470 --> 08:02.633
And guess what?
Everyone should blame you.

08:02.640 --> 08:03.937
I blame you!

08:03.940 --> 08:06.033
(Students murmuring)

08:06.050 --> 08:09.508
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

08:17.790 --> 08:19.917
You're right.
I shouldn't have
come to school today.

08:19.930 --> 08:23.718
Just get your stuff
and let's get out of here.

08:28.030 --> 08:29.793
Oh, my god.

08:40.450 --> 08:43.078
"Oh, it's okay.
She'll forgive you,
just like I did."

08:43.080 --> 08:45.913
That is what
you said to me, Noah.
Like, four hundred times!

08:45.920 --> 08:47.717
Because that's what
i thought! Seriously!

08:47.720 --> 08:50.541
I could never imagine
that it would go this bad.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.016
Yeah, well, I did! Okay?

08:52.030 --> 08:54.851
You've never _felt
Emma's rejection!

08:54.860 --> 08:57.021
It's hardcore!
And, now, she hates me

08:57.030 --> 08:58.793
and Kieran hates me
and Brooke hates me.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.769
And there's no coming
back from this.
I'll talk to her.

09:01.770 --> 09:03.590
Like that'll work.
She doesn't trust you either.

09:03.600 --> 09:08.105
I know. She thinks
I'm the one who sent her
the audio file.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.607
You too? Seriously?

09:11.610 --> 09:12.975
Why did you record
our conversation?

09:12.980 --> 09:16.245
That's weird.
And you kept pushing me
to tell her everything.

09:16.250 --> 09:21.586
Audrey, I promise you,
i recorded our_conversation
by accndent!

09:21.590 --> 09:24.753
Did you send it
by accident, too?
I didn't send it to her!

09:24.760 --> 09:28.127
You are_ un-hackable!
That IS what you
always tell me!

09:28.130 --> 09:29.825
So, what is it?
What am I supposed to think?

09:29.830 --> 09:32.651
That-that's... I...
Someone sent that file.

09:32.670 --> 09:34.968
Someone with access
to your computer
in your room...

09:34.970 --> 09:37.222
Which is a very small list
of suspects, by the way!

09:37.240 --> 09:39.196
Okay, now,
you're just being mean.

09:39.210 --> 09:43.931
Aside from me and your mother,
who else has been in your room?

09:46.050 --> 09:47.574
It was not Zoe. Okay?

09:47.580 --> 09:49.798
She would never
do anything like that!
God! Come on, foster!

09:49.820 --> 09:52.072
If it were anyone else,
you'd have her tracked
all over your murderboard.

09:52.090 --> 09:54.149
Stop it! You don't know
what you're talking about!

09:54.150 --> 09:57.950
You have no idea!
You have no clue!

09:59.860 --> 10:02.681
Hiding out in an empty
classroom? Not cool, guys.

10:02.700 --> 10:03.724
Sorry, Mr. Kaufman.

10:03.730 --> 10:06.198
We were just
practicing sonnets.

10:06.200 --> 10:09.067
But we should probably go.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.599
My house, after school.

10:12.610 --> 10:15.534
I'll prove to you
it's not Zoe.

10:24.780 --> 10:26.611
Once we play this tape,
we can't unplay it.

10:26.620 --> 10:29.088
And you know that there's
something horrible on there.

10:29.090 --> 10:33.186
Most likely,
but we need to hear it.

10:35.190 --> 10:36.623
Yeah.

10:36.630 --> 10:38.120
Yeah...
I have to play it.

10:38.130 --> 10:40.598
Emma:
A lot of people are trying
to help me right now,

10:40.600 --> 10:42.568
and it seems to be
turn/ng out for the worst.

10:42.570 --> 10:44.595
Lang:
We ’re just worried
about you, Emma.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.568
Emma:
I cannot talk
about this n'ght now.

10:46.570 --> 10:48.231
Okay? I really need you
to give me some space,

10:48.240 --> 10:51.038
orI don’t/(now
what I ’m gonna do.
That was at the grindhouse.

10:51.040 --> 10:52.701
I had no idea
that she was recording that.

10:52.710 --> 10:54.803
Lang:
Add to the Emma ﬁle.
Emma ’5 clearly threatening me.

10:54.810 --> 10:57.347
I ’m currently a target
for her paranoia
and aggression.

10:57.350 --> 11:01.343
Aﬁ‘er witness/ng
her attack on Ha y/ey meyers
and the vandal/ism of my ofﬁce,

11:01.350 --> 11:05.059
its evident that Emma has
seriously vio/ent tendencies.

11:05.060 --> 11:06.789
ButI need her.
She needs me?

11:06.790 --> 11:08.849
So, I ’/i find a way
to break through.

11:08.860 --> 11:11.055
She's obviously
obsessed with you.
Attempts to deepen

11:11.060 --> 11:13.028
my relationship with Emma
have been hindered

11:13.030 --> 11:15.191
by her c/ear
emotiona/ Instab/iity.

11:15.200 --> 11:18.966
Must be d/iigent
about rebu/id/ng my...

11:18.970 --> 11:21.006
(static)

11:22.780 --> 11:25.305
Is that how people see me?
As violent? Unstable?

11:25.310 --> 11:27.073
No. You can't take
this stuff seriously.

11:27.080 --> 11:30.914
Lang was stalking you,
but this tape came
from the killer.

11:30.920 --> 11:34.139
No, but i-i did those things.
I lost control. I exploded.

11:34.150 --> 11:37.950
God, I... I almost shot you
last night, Kieran.

11:37.960 --> 11:40.315
This is _not a normal
Situation, Emma.

11:40.330 --> 11:42.753
Anyone would react this way.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.990
You've been manipulated.

11:49.040 --> 11:55.036
Okay, so... that audio file
Emma received, it definitely
did come from my blog bin.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.837
I can't deny that.

11:56.840 --> 11:59.570
Would you stop
giving me "the look"?

11:59.580 --> 12:01.844
Prove me wrong.

12:01.850 --> 12:03.579
(Knocking)

12:06.050 --> 12:09.542
Why is she here?
He asked me to come over.

12:11.890 --> 12:13.687
Although, now,
I'm wondering why.

12:13.690 --> 12:15.521
Hey, great! How about
you wonder downstairs?

12:15.530 --> 12:18.249
Hey! You want to know
who sent Emma that file?
So do I.

12:18.260 --> 12:22.799
And, if someone somehow hacked
into the fortress of solitude,

12:22.800 --> 12:24.768
then Zoe can help us
figure out who and how.

12:24.770 --> 12:26.533
Wait, someone hacked you?
Yeah.

12:26.540 --> 12:31.136
What did they take?
Oh, yes, please keep
playing dumb.

12:31.610 --> 12:33.009
You asked for this.

12:33.010 --> 12:37.549
I think you pirated
a very sensitive file
from Noah's computer

12:37.550 --> 12:38.744
and sent it to Emma.

12:38.750 --> 12:41.981
Okay, and why would I do that?
To make me think it was Noah,

12:41.990 --> 12:43.787
cause a rift between us,
get me out of the picture.

12:43.790 --> 12:47.248
I'm not stupid, Audrey.
You're obviously impossible
to get out of the picture.

12:47.260 --> 12:49.854
No wonder
Noah's still a virgin.

12:50.660 --> 12:54.699
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
for that_ to sound so...
jealous?

12:55.200 --> 12:56.690
'Cause it did.

12:56.700 --> 12:59.294
She did this and there's_
a very easy way to prove it.

12:59.310 --> 13:04.009
Just go into your sent files
and see if she sent it
to herself.

13:05.310 --> 13:06.299
Oh, that'll work.

13:06.310 --> 13:10.144
Oh, my god. Shocking.
Audrey had a good idea.

13:12.080 --> 13:16.016
Noah, there's something
that I should tell you.

13:19.960 --> 13:23.157
It was you!
No, okay, i... I did send it,
but only to myself.

13:23.160 --> 13:26.550
I'm sorry!
You know what a huge fan
of the morgue I am. Ijust...

13:26.570 --> 13:30.267
I wanted to finish listening
to it, but once I did,
i deleted it.

13:30.270 --> 13:33.660
I did not send it
to anyone else, I swear!

13:34.340 --> 13:36.001
And you expect us
to believe this?

13:36.010 --> 13:38.137
You're screwing
with people's lives!

13:38.140 --> 13:40.700
She's telling the truth.

13:45.020 --> 13:48.615
I got the thread
off Emma's phone.
Who is Emma's secret friend?

13:48.620 --> 13:50.645
No idea, but ifI can
hack into the isp,

13:50.660 --> 13:54.050
I can probably find out who
the account's registered to.

13:54.060 --> 13:55.721
So...

14:05.770 --> 14:07.328
(Knocking on door)

14:07.340 --> 14:09.706
I got an ID
on the second body.

14:09.710 --> 14:11.109
Body?
From the fire?

14:11.110 --> 14:15.649
Oh.
Eddie Hayes, 24. He had
an Insulin pump implant.

14:15.650 --> 14:17.277
I matched him
to the serial number.

14:17.280 --> 14:20.670
He was a clerk
at the Crescent palms motel.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.312
Something wrong?

14:23.920 --> 14:28.152
What? No, I'm fine.
You don't seem fine.

14:28.760 --> 14:32.298
You said you needed
my help on this case.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.029
And I do.

14:42.140 --> 14:43.732
I've been through this.

14:43.740 --> 14:46.277
It's not a normal case._
If you want to stay objective,

14:46.280 --> 14:50.774
you're gonna have
to find a way to deal
with your personal stuff.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.711
Stavo didn't come home
last night.

14:54.720 --> 14:57.041
I've been trying to call him,
but he won't answer my calls.

14:57.060 --> 15:00.211
Was he at school today?
Apparently.

15:00.230 --> 15:02.050
Well, at least
you know he's okay.

15:02.060 --> 15:06.349
That's just it.
I'm not so sure.
Ever Since...

15:07.970 --> 15:09.722
Since when?

15:10.440 --> 15:11.839
Phoenix.

15:11.840 --> 15:13.865
It happened right
after his mother died.

15:13.870 --> 15:15.235
Stavo and his
best friend, Kyle...

15:15.240 --> 15:17.231
Somehow, they got
a hold of my gun.

15:17.240 --> 15:19.333
They were messing around
with it and it went off.

15:19.350 --> 15:23.104
And the boy, Kyle...
Got shot in the face.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.747
Oh, my god.
Stavo called it in,

15:24.750 --> 15:26.911
but, by the time I got there,
the boy was dead.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.888
He must have
been traumatized.

15:28.890 --> 15:33.213
To see his friend die
in front of his eyes
like that...

15:34.190 --> 15:36.784
He was cool as a cucumber.

15:36.800 --> 15:40.019
He was drawing...
In his notebook.

15:40.030 --> 15:41.691
Drawing what?

15:41.700 --> 15:43.918
Kyle...

15:43.940 --> 15:44.895
Dying... dead...

15:44.900 --> 15:49.405
There was a question as to
how long the boy was bleeding
before he called it in.

15:49.410 --> 15:52.470
Ultimately, they ruled it
an accidental death.

15:52.480 --> 15:55.779
(Sighs)
We came to lakewood
for a fresh start,

15:55.780 --> 15:58.817
but, then,
i found these in his room.

16:15.070 --> 16:17.766
Emma: What do we do?
Do we just go in there
and interrogate her?

16:17.770 --> 16:20.933
It depends what kind
of condition she's in.

16:20.940 --> 16:22.362
The killer planted
that tape for me.

16:22.370 --> 16:24.873
There's clearly
some connection
With Ms. lang.

16:24.880 --> 16:27.132
Either she gave him
that tape, or he took it.

16:27.150 --> 16:30.244
That may be how
she wound up here.

16:31.180 --> 16:34.274
You can come back now.
Thanks.

16:34.290 --> 16:35.814
She's under sedation
at the moment,

16:35.820 --> 16:37.287
but is alert enough,
when awake,

16:37.290 --> 16:38.757
to recognize faces
and respond.

16:38.760 --> 16:42.127
Her throat's a little raw
from the breathing tube,
so speech is difficult.

16:42.130 --> 16:45.850
Still, I think she'll
be very happy to know
her students care.

16:45.870 --> 16:49.966
So, just speak quietly.
No sudden movements.

16:49.970 --> 16:52.438
(Monitor beeping)

16:52.440 --> 16:54.169
Kristin?

16:54.410 --> 16:57.265
Kristin,
you have a visitor.

16:58.280 --> 17:01.977
I'll be right outside
if you need me.
Okay.

17:02.550 --> 17:04.279
Ms. lang?

17:04.280 --> 17:07.147
It's me, Emma.

17:07.490 --> 17:09.344
How are you doing?

17:09.790 --> 17:12.281
Can I get you something?
Do you want some water?

17:12.290 --> 17:13.985
Um...

17:16.160 --> 17:18.549
(Screaming)
Ms. lang? Oh, my god,
are you okay?

17:18.560 --> 17:20.994
Oh, my god.
Uh, excuse me?
(Monitor beeping rapidly)

17:21.000 --> 17:22.865
Nurse: Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

17:22.870 --> 17:25.031
Move, move!
Kristin, are you with me?

17:25.040 --> 17:27.031
Take a deep breath.
Open the drip!

17:27.040 --> 17:29.531
All right,
take a deep breath.
Try to relax.

17:29.540 --> 17:31.508
What happened?
I... I don't know.

17:31.510 --> 17:35.173
Nurse:
All right, that's it.
Nice and easy.

17:38.980 --> 17:41.847
Strange.
Seriously strange.

17:41.850 --> 17:43.738
She was so afraid of me.

17:43.760 --> 17:44.715
I know.

17:44.720 --> 17:46.415
I know they're saying
she fell down the stairs,

17:46.430 --> 17:50.981
but I am feeling more and more
like she was attacked.

17:51.200 --> 17:54.226
Why did she say she needed me?
What does that mean?

17:54.230 --> 17:58.064
Man:
Kristin lang? Room 134?

18:00.270 --> 18:02.238
Daisies...
Thank you.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.777
This is gonna
sound weird, but...

18:04.780 --> 18:07.977
Brandon Ja_mes used to call
my mom "Daisy." Is that crazy?

18:07.980 --> 18:10.744
Do you think it makes any sense
that it would be connected?

18:10.750 --> 18:14.470
With everything
that's going on,
no, not crazy.

18:20.430 --> 18:21.954
What is it?

18:21.960 --> 18:24.121
"Love, Piper"?
This is from the killer.

18:24.130 --> 18:25.950
We have to do something.
We have to figure this out.

18:25.970 --> 18:32.091
Oh, my god.
He's messing with me,
or Ms. lang, or something.

18:32.870 --> 18:33.734
Stay here.

18:33.740 --> 18:35.799
I have an idea.

19:01.130 --> 19:04.099
Excuse me! I'm sorry.
She can't have visitors
right now.

19:04.100 --> 19:09.800
I just wanted
to make sure she was okay.
She's fine. Thank you.

19:12.410 --> 19:14.799
I'm going to the courthouse
for my council meeting.

19:14.810 --> 19:18.018
Call me if you need me.
Will do, chief.

19:27.260 --> 19:29.023
Hey.

19:40.870 --> 19:42.462
(Door closes)

20:50.010 --> 20:52.604
Wow! Where did you
learn to do that?
Hack and error.

20:52.610 --> 20:56.000
Yes, very impressive.
Why are we wasting
our time with this?

20:56.010 --> 20:58.171
She emailed herself that file,
then sent it to Emma

20:58.180 --> 21:00.216
with that "secret friend"
dummy email account.

21:00.220 --> 21:03.280
If I was going to do it,
i wouldn't have
done it that way.

21:03.290 --> 21:04.348
Got it! I got it.

21:04.360 --> 21:07.409
Here it is. It looks like
the offending email address

21:07.430 --> 21:09.523
is registered to...

21:11.130 --> 21:12.290
Zoe Vaughn?

21:12.300 --> 21:15.895
I did not do it!
Where do you get off?
It's your name!

21:15.900 --> 21:18.232
If she said she didn't do it,
Audrey, she didn't do it.

21:18.240 --> 21:19.559
Why would I even
put it in my name?

21:19.570 --> 21:22.368
She pirated this file
off your computer
when you weren't looking.

21:22.370 --> 21:23.667
That's s_er_ious.
Yes, it is,

21:23.680 --> 21:26.035
but you're also forgetting
what this is all about.

21:26.040 --> 21:28.577
She's lying about this!
No, no! Stop!

21:28.580 --> 21:30.309
I get why this is
so important to you.

21:30.320 --> 21:32.208
I want to figure out
who did this to me and Emma!

21:32.220 --> 21:34.415
Audrey, finding out
who sent that file to Emma

21:34.420 --> 21:36.479
is not gonna change
what you did

21:36.490 --> 21:39.152
or how Emma feels about it.

21:39.360 --> 21:41.487
I was gonna tell her.
Yeah, but you didn't.

21:41.490 --> 21:47.554
And now that Emma knows,
you have to deal with that
and go talk to
her.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.295
I'm 5... I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have...

21:50.300 --> 21:52.632
No, you know what?
You should've.

21:52.640 --> 21:53.937
It's okay. You're right.

21:53.940 --> 21:55.202
Audrey...
No! You know what?

21:55.210 --> 21:58.600
I just need to figure out
how to fix things with Emma!

21:58.610 --> 22:02.205
(Door opens, slams closed)

22:05.420 --> 22:06.944
That was rough.

22:06.950 --> 22:10.317
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

22:11.990 --> 22:15.153
Thank you.
For...?

22:15.160 --> 22:17.321
For having my back.

22:17.330 --> 22:19.958
I, um...

22:22.130 --> 22:24.394
I really appreciate it.

22:24.740 --> 22:26.492
Yeah, I mean, I was...

22:26.510 --> 22:32.574
Iwa... Ijust...
i really believed you
were telling the truth.

22:33.650 --> 22:35.709
I was.

22:45.060 --> 22:47.688
Woman:
come on and watch me go

22:47.690 --> 22:50.579
nothing in the world
can get me down

22:50.600 --> 22:53.228
gonna get there
on my own

22:53.230 --> 22:56.597
Ican do it,
Ican do it, I...

22:56.600 --> 22:59.239
come on and watch me go

22:59.240 --> 23:01.629
nothing in the world
can get me down

23:01.640 --> 23:04.108
gonna get there
on my own

23:04.110 --> 23:06.772
Ican do it,
Ican do it, I...

23:06.780 --> 23:10.648
go get it go get it

23:12.720 --> 23:16.417
go get it go get it

23:18.360 --> 23:21.625
go get it go get it

23:23.560 --> 23:27.018
virgin? Seriously?
Where did you learn
to do that?

23:27.030 --> 23:33.390
Phantasm ii. _
It's a terrible mowe,
but one hell of a sex scene.

23:33.410 --> 23:35.207
(Chuckles)

23:39.480 --> 23:43.746
Should we be doing this?
We have to start somewhere.

23:44.250 --> 23:48.539
Wow. This is exactly what
i thought Ms. lang's house
would look like.

23:48.550 --> 23:51.485
You thought about
what it would look like?

23:51.490 --> 23:53.788
(Scoffs)

23:56.400 --> 24:02.191
What are we looking for?
Anything suspicious,
i guess.

24:11.780 --> 24:15.648
Her bag.
I'm gonna look over here.

24:29.360 --> 24:31.692
Did you find anything?
No.

24:31.700 --> 24:34.351
How about you?
No.

24:34.370 --> 24:38.488
I don't know. Maybe
there's something at school?

24:38.500 --> 24:41.799
Because this is _
a complete waste of time.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.447
(Vehicle approaching)

24:53.790 --> 24:55.644
It's the neighbor.

25:02.190 --> 25:05.353
Why is that picture
upside down?

25:16.340 --> 25:17.500
Kieran...

25:17.510 --> 25:20.877
Look at this.
Piper and lang...

25:20.880 --> 25:22.905
They knew each other.

25:24.250 --> 25:28.277
If they were friends...
And you killed Piper...

25:28.290 --> 25:31.646
That would explain
her obsession with you.

25:38.030 --> 25:40.021
About the recording
in the first place.

25:40.030 --> 25:43.989
And what would he gain
by implicating me?
Unless this is about us.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.505
Oh, no. Zoe, I might have
gotten you involved.
I'm so sorry.

25:48.510 --> 25:54.574
No, I got myself
involved, okay?
I would do it again.

25:59.580 --> 26:02.287
But... how did he even know
i was into you?

26:02.290 --> 26:03.689
It was pretty obvious.
Really?

26:03.690 --> 26:07.251
Yeah! Anyone watching
would have seen it.

26:07.260 --> 26:09.581
(Both laugh)

26:14.300 --> 26:16.518
What?
Oh, crap.

26:16.540 --> 26:22.968
What?
No. No! No, no, no!

26:23.440 --> 26:24.668
How could I have
missed that?

26:24.680 --> 26:26.238
What? What's wrong?

26:26.240 --> 26:28.470
It's bugged!
What is?

26:28.480 --> 26:31.244
The camera
in the storage unit.
The killer put it there.

26:31.250 --> 26:34.572
That's how he knew
about the recording.
He hasn't been watching us.

26:34.590 --> 26:38.139
He's been listening!
He knew I would take it.

26:38.160 --> 26:41.049
He's heard everything!

26:41.260 --> 26:45.458
It was hanging upside down?
Yeah. Someone meant
for us to find this.

26:45.460 --> 26:48.691
How would anyone know
we were coming?
I don't know.

26:48.700 --> 26:51.191
Blessed sisters
children's home?

26:51.200 --> 26:52.997
Yeah, I think that's nearby.

26:53.000 --> 26:57.403
I remember hearing
weird stories about it
when I was a kid.

26:57.410 --> 26:59.571
Well, I know we're both
mad at him right now,

26:59.580 --> 27:03.539
but you know
who's an expert
on weird stories?

27:04.180 --> 27:08.014
Oh, yeah,
i know blessed sisters.
I can't believe Piper was there.

27:08.020 --> 27:10.739
That place is notorious.
What do you mean,
"notorious"?

27:10.760 --> 27:13.479
Uh, it was a group foster home
until ten years ago,

27:13.490 --> 27:16.027
but before that,
it was an insane asylum.

27:16.030 --> 27:17.429
I mean, you should hear
what they say

27:17.430 --> 27:19.398
about the lobotomy labs
on the third floor.

27:19.400 --> 27:21.322
Noah, focus.
Right. Uh...

27:21.330 --> 27:24.265
Uh, it closed down
after an abuse scandal.

27:24.270 --> 27:27.091
Something about instructors
and kids in the attic.

27:27.110 --> 27:29.761
Well, Ms. lang and Piper
both grew up there.

27:29.770 --> 27:34.378
What? That is one piece
of the Piper puzzle
i could never find.

27:34.380 --> 27:36.439
How did you...?
It's a long story.

27:36.450 --> 27:38.077
But it ends with,
we're going there now.

27:38.080 --> 27:40.071
Emma:
I have to see
where they grew up.

27:40.090 --> 27:42.240
Yeah. I'll meet you there.

27:42.250 --> 27:44.445
We'll meet you there.

27:44.460 --> 27:48.055
Right, uh,
we will meet you there.

27:48.060 --> 27:50.278
Uh... okay.

27:55.100 --> 27:56.624
(Creaking)

27:57.270 --> 28:02.503
What the hell?
I thought I told you
no more coed sleepovers.

28:02.510 --> 28:06.401
I'm not amused.
You need to leave.

28:07.410 --> 28:09.776
You needed to know
aboutJake.

28:16.250 --> 28:18.081
Where did you get this?

28:18.090 --> 28:21.253
Cops. Your dad
and Jake had business.

28:21.260 --> 28:24.684
Jake was gonna burn down
a building for him.

28:27.430 --> 28:30.263
This was the night
he died...

28:30.270 --> 28:32.761
The last night
we were together.

28:36.210 --> 28:38.360
What else did you find?

28:45.620 --> 28:50.239
Don't "honey" me.
Don't say anything.

28:50.260 --> 28:51.716
You hired Jake...

28:51.720 --> 28:55.349
To burn down your stupid
failed development.

28:55.360 --> 28:58.124
Brooke...
You're not making sense.

28:58.130 --> 28:59.119
Don't even!

28:59.130 --> 29:00.791
You got him to do
your dirty work,

29:00.800 --> 29:04.167
and it was the last night
of his life.

29:04.170 --> 29:05.865
And you didn't tell
the sheriff?

29:05.870 --> 29:08.134
Brooke, I couldn't tell...

29:08.140 --> 29:11.564
You sat next to me
while I cried my eyes out

29:11.580 --> 29:14.708
and you said nothing!

29:16.380 --> 29:17.449
How did you find out?

29:17.450 --> 29:20.817
What does it matter
how I found out?

29:20.820 --> 29:24.745
Jake would still be alive
if it wasn't for you.

29:29.230 --> 29:34.395
You drove my mom away.
You killed my boyfriend.

29:34.770 --> 29:37.523
What kind of father are you?

30:00.530 --> 30:04.819
(Ringtone playing)

30:09.430 --> 30:13.537
What do you want now?
I ’m sorry m/ss lakewood
ruined your virgin,

30:13.540 --> 30:15.599
but unfortunately,
that means he has to die.

30:15.610 --> 30:19.831
If you want to come
pick up the pieces,
heres the address.

30:19.840 --> 30:21.273
No...

30:21.280 --> 30:23.271
(Phone dings)

30:40.300 --> 30:43.098
Somebody's throwing a party.

30:48.510 --> 30:49.863
Emma:
What the hell is this?

30:49.870 --> 30:53.601
Why are people wearing
Brandon James masks?

30:53.850 --> 30:58.139
What's going on here?
Looks like a harmless act
of teenage rebellion to me.

30:58.150 --> 30:59.708
Noah, when was the last time
you heard of a party

30:59.720 --> 31:02.382
being held at blessed sisters
children's home?

31:02.390 --> 31:05.450
Yeah, the timing
is super weird.

31:07.490 --> 31:09.287
Excuse me.

31:12.630 --> 31:14.894
Hey! Do you know
who's throwing this party?

31:14.900 --> 31:17.698
Yeah, totally.
It's such a cool idea.

31:17.700 --> 31:18.894
The "screw you" of it all.

31:18.900 --> 31:20.788
"Face the fear.
Take back the night."

31:20.810 --> 31:23.404
I never would've thought
you'd have it in you.

31:23.410 --> 31:26.573
Me? You think that
I'm throwing this party?

31:26.580 --> 31:29.799
Well, yeah.
You and Audrey Jensen.

31:33.820 --> 31:35.481
What?

31:40.530 --> 31:43.522
(Suspenseful music playing)

31:44.400 --> 31:47.153
(Line ringing)
Come on, Noah, answer.

31:47.170 --> 31:50.389
(Loud dance music playing)
(Phone ringing)

31:53.270 --> 31:54.862
(Ringing continues)

31:54.870 --> 31:58.408
You ’ve reached /Voah.
Leave a message.

32:02.180 --> 32:04.444
It had to be the killer.
He's trying to set me
and Audrey up for something.

32:04.450 --> 32:07.248
That's why he sent that invite.
And these people just
blindly bought into it.

32:07.250 --> 32:10.447
It's like they've never
seen
Apni foo/s day,
or
the house on haunted h/ii.

32:10.460 --> 32:13.782
Accepting an invitation to
a mysterious party practically
ensures a grisly death.

32:13.790 --> 32:17.180
Isn’t
Apni foo/s day
the one
where everything turns out
to be a prank in the end?

32:17.200 --> 32:19.452
Not if you've seen
the alternate ending.
Foster, focus.

32:19.460 --> 32:21.519
We need to figure out
a way to shut this party
down right now.

32:21.530 --> 32:25.637
That's definitely gonna be
as easy as it sounds.
I can call sheriff acosta.

32:25.640 --> 32:27.631
I'll tell him
there's underage drinking.

32:27.640 --> 32:28.800
It's not really a party

32:28.810 --> 32:30.437
without the music,
or the lights.

32:30.440 --> 32:33.375
Zoe Vaughan, you are brilliant.
We'll shut down the electricity.

32:33.380 --> 32:36.440
We just need
to find the source.
Emma: That's a great idea.

32:36.450 --> 32:38.577
Go. Figure it out.

32:42.350 --> 32:46.252
Kieran, it's Hayley.
Do you think that
she threw this party?

32:46.260 --> 32:47.249
(Line ringing)

32:47.260 --> 32:51.356
Sheriff acosta,
it's Kieran wilcox.

32:52.860 --> 32:54.828
Hey.
Emma!

32:54.830 --> 32:56.889
Wow, I'm surprised
you showed.

32:56.900 --> 32:58.629
Are you a part
of this thing?

32:58.640 --> 33:00.335
You should know.
It's your party.

33:00.340 --> 33:02.865
(Scoffs)
Can I offer you a mask?

33:02.870 --> 33:04.531
No, you can give me
an explanation.

33:04.540 --> 33:07.907
Uh, who sent out that invite
and why was my name on it?

33:07.910 --> 33:10.879
Okay, calm down.
It's just a joke.

33:10.880 --> 33:13.519
I said I'd help out.

33:14.020 --> 33:15.271
Help who out?

33:15.290 --> 33:16.848
A friend.

33:16.860 --> 33:18.009
A very special friend,

33:18.020 --> 33:19.556
who prefers
to remain anonymous.

33:19.560 --> 33:21.858
And I protect my friends.
Surely, you can respect that.

33:21.860 --> 33:24.988
Hayley, do you realize
you might be protecting
a killer right now?

33:25.000 --> 33:27.025
(Chuckles)
Who is your friend?

33:27.030 --> 33:29.294
Stop being so paranoid!

33:29.300 --> 33:31.029
It's someone I'm seeing.

33:37.610 --> 33:39.498
Hayley, wait!

33:40.780 --> 33:42.748
Hayley!

33:43.650 --> 33:45.709
Sorry. Excuse me.

33:54.330 --> 33:55.957
Audrey!

33:57.000 --> 33:59.924
(Music playing faintly)

34:03.540 --> 34:06.839
_ Woman:
work/ng at the i/Ideo store,
every day’s a bore

34:06.840 --> 34:08.330
I just dream away

34:08.340 --> 34:11.002
DVDs are gone for life,
we just get on/ine

34:11.010 --> 34:13.433
and go to pirate bay...

34:13.440 --> 34:15.977
(door closes)
...In the disco //ght

34:15.980 --> 34:18.005
give me that bass,
right up in my face

34:18.020 --> 34:20.614
I want g/itter
on the floor ton/ght

34:20.620 --> 34:21.609
Audrey! Hey, stop!

34:21.620 --> 34:23.542
Audrey! Did you know
about this party?

34:23.560 --> 34:24.845
No, no.
Okay.

34:24.860 --> 34:28.409
Look, someone set it up
to make it look like
we planned this. You and me.

34:28.430 --> 34:30.022
Okay, then it was
probably the killer.
I know!

34:30.030 --> 34:31.986
That's what
I'm trying to tell you.
He led me here.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.855
Did Noah come with you?
Is he here?
Yeah, he's here with Zoe.

34:34.870 --> 34:38.021
Why?
The killer just called me.
Noah's his next target.

34:38.040 --> 34:39.667
/Vot someone I can talk to

34:39.670 --> 34:43.060
I want someone
who can dance

34:46.440 --> 34:49.375
hey there, stranger.

34:49.380 --> 34:50.802
Miss me?

34:50.820 --> 34:54.916
I was starting to think
we'd never get any alone time.

34:57.890 --> 34:59.812
No need for
the silent treatment.

34:59.820 --> 35:05.019
Everything worked out perfect.
They all showed up,
just like you wanted.

35:08.070 --> 35:12.689
I guess I'll just have
to find somewhere else
to put my lips.

35:21.680 --> 35:23.739
(Screams)

35:25.580 --> 35:27.411
(Screaming)

35:27.720 --> 35:30.518
I want someone
who can dance

35:31.120 --> 35:35.682
(screaming)
I want someone
who can dance

35:35.930 --> 35:37.886
(screaming)

35:44.900 --> 35:48.529
No, I ’m not insane

35:48.810 --> 35:52.803
we are not insane

35:52.810 --> 35:55.529
no, I ’m not insane

35:55.550 --> 35:57.700
I want someone
who can dance

35:57.720 --> 35:59.847
not someone
I can talk to...

35:59.850 --> 36:05.789
they're not labeled.
How do we know which breaker
controls that giant room?

36:05.790 --> 36:06.711
We don't.

36:06.720 --> 36:10.486
That's why we're gonna have
to turn off all of them.

36:10.500 --> 36:11.956
Okay.

36:13.730 --> 36:15.698
Emma! Emma!

36:15.700 --> 36:20.194
(People clamoring)
Kieran: Emma!

36:20.810 --> 36:22.562
This is not good.
We need to find Noah.

36:22.570 --> 36:24.435
This is fine. This means
Zoe and Noah are still alive.

36:24.440 --> 36:27.102
They were gonna try
and figure out a way to turn off
the lights and stop the party.

36:27.110 --> 36:29.647
Okay, then we need to find him.
We need to get him out of here.

36:29.650 --> 36:32.915
I know that!
Did the killer
just do this because...

36:32.920 --> 36:35.980
Because you're
the last person I want
to be stuck with right now?

36:35.990 --> 36:37.810
Yes!
Yeah, probably.

36:37.820 --> 36:40.983
(Phone dings)
(Phone vibrates)

36:46.230 --> 36:48.926
Kieran...
Noah!

36:50.500 --> 36:53.537
Emma! Emma!

36:55.070 --> 36:56.765
Emma!

37:00.140 --> 37:02.005
Emma!

37:02.680 --> 37:04.944
Kieran?

37:04.950 --> 37:06.542
Noah!

37:10.120 --> 37:11.985
Noah?

37:14.630 --> 37:18.020
Hey, hold up.
What's that? On the wall.

37:25.270 --> 37:27.989
Kieran?
Noah?

37:50.860 --> 37:52.657
Oh, my god.

37:56.130 --> 37:58.098
Who is that?

38:03.240 --> 38:07.233
God...
Oh, my god.

38:08.810 --> 38:12.917
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god, it's Piper!

38:18.720 --> 38:22.315
That this...
All of this... is my fault.

38:22.690 --> 38:24.419
And you're right.
It is. I know that.

38:24.430 --> 38:29.367
And the killer knows that.
He's throwing Piper's
dead body in my face.

38:29.370 --> 38:33.261
The killer wanted us
to find Piper's body together...

38:33.270 --> 38:36.034
Because we both killed Piper.

38:36.040 --> 38:41.068
And, now... he wants
revenge on both of us.

38:43.210 --> 38:46.316
(Sighs)
I know you didn't
throw the party.

38:46.320 --> 38:49.414
No. Someone's just trying
to make it look that way.

38:49.420 --> 38:51.342
Do you have
any information at all?

38:51.360 --> 38:53.316
Yes, you need to talk
to Hayley meyers.

38:53.320 --> 38:56.426
She said that she helped
someone throw this party.

38:56.430 --> 39:00.093
Did she give you a name?
No, she just said it was...

39:00.100 --> 39:01.556
A very special friend.

39:01.570 --> 39:05.267
And I think that friend
is the killer.

39:05.800 --> 39:06.732
Sheriff...

39:06.740 --> 39:10.198
There's something
you need to see right away.

39:16.850 --> 39:18.738
(Knocking on door)

39:23.090 --> 39:24.682
You're late.

39:32.230 --> 39:34.095
I'm sorry.

39:37.170 --> 39:38.489
Sparing no expense, I see.

39:38.500 --> 39:43.858
(Sighs) I couldn't be home,
and I didn't want to be alone.

39:44.640 --> 39:46.471
Me neither.

39:47.550 --> 39:50.439
It's my mom's special place.

39:50.880 --> 39:53.474
For special friends?

40:14.470 --> 40:17.701
(Suspenseful music playing)

40:18.410 --> 40:20.378
Miguel:
Hayley meyers...

40:21.650 --> 40:24.141
A very special friend...
