KEEP IT DOWN.

00:32.597 --> 00:35.861
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
IN THE BOOK THAT
CAN FIX THIS.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.602
NO, THERE'S
GOTTA BE SOMETHING.

00:37.776 --> 00:41.519
THERE'S NOT, AND
THEY CAN'T UNDO WHAT'S
ALREADY BEEN DONE.

00:47.830 --> 00:49.788
I'M SURE
THE BOYS ARE OK.

WHERE'S CHRISTY?

01:09.417 --> 01:11.071
OH, SHE--
SHE'S GONE.

THE CHARMED ONES?

THE ONLY ONE LEFT.

01:16.685 --> 01:20.036
I DON'T UNDERSTAND,
YOU SAID THE HOLLOW
WOULD BE ENOUGH.

01:20.210 --> 01:22.082
THEY GOT IT, TOO.

01:22.256 --> 01:24.693
THEY SOMEHOW FOUND OUT
YOU WERE GOING TO
USE IT AGAINST THEM,

01:24.867 --> 01:28.218
SO THEY SUMMONED IT, TOO.
IT MUST'VE SPLIT,
INFECTED YOU ALL.

01:28.392 --> 01:30.481
I JUST WANT
CHRISTY BACK.

01:30.655 --> 01:33.223
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO.

01:34.529 --> 01:36.922
YOU'VE GOT
THE POWER, BILLIE.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.187
YOU'VE PROJECTED YOURSELF
BACK INTO THE PAST
BEFORE, HAVEN'T YOU?

01:40.361 --> 01:42.537
WHEN CHRISTY WAS YOUNG,
WHEN SHE WAS TRAPPED
IN THAT CAVE?

01:42.711 --> 01:44.016
WELL, YEAH, BUT I--

01:44.191 --> 01:45.627
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU
DO IT AGAIN?

01:45.801 --> 01:48.978
ONLY THIS TIME
YOU CAN GO BACK
TO CHANGE WHAT WAS,

01:49.152 --> 01:51.241

ALL RIGHT?

03:28.208 --> 03:29.252
UM...

03:30.558 --> 03:32.995
MAYBE YOU
SHOULD SIT DOWN.

03:35.824 --> 03:38.000
NO, I DON'T
WANNA SIT DOWN.

WHAT'S GOING ON?

03:40.785 --> 03:45.312
WELL, PHOEBE
AND PAIGE, UM...

03:47.749 --> 03:49.316
THEY DIDN'T MAKE IT.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.971
WHAT?
BUT IT'S OK.

03:53.145 --> 03:55.757
I MEAN, I'M GONNA FIX IT,
I DON'T KNOW HOW, BUT...

I'M GOING TO FIX IT.

ABOUT THE ELDERS,

ABOUT COOP?

GO BACK IN TIME

HOW THIS HAPPENED,

07:33.757 --> 07:35.629
I WAS FOCUSING
ON PHOEBE,

07:35.803 --> 07:38.458
AND IT WAS SUPPOSED TO
TAKE ME BACK TO WHEN SHE
WOULD BE ALIVE AGAIN.

07:38.632 --> 07:39.894
WELL, MAYBE IT DID,

07:40.068 --> 07:41.896

07:55.300 --> 07:58.260
TRYING TO SAVE
PHOEBE AND PAIGE--

07:58.434 --> 08:02.133

WE HAVE ANOTHER DAUGHTER?

08:05.746 --> 08:08.096
YES, MOM, YOU DO.

08:09.576 --> 08:10.577
BUT THE POINT IS,

08:12.100 --> 08:13.144
THEY DIED...

08:13.318 --> 08:15.103
IN A HUGE BATTLE,

08:15.277 --> 08:16.713

TO GO BACK IN TIME

WE HAD TO USE THIS,.

THE POWER OF THREE?

SO, IF I'M THE MOTHER OF THE
CHARMED ONES, AND WE COULD
FIND THE GRANDMOTHER,

08:34.731 --> 08:38.387
THEN MAYBE WE'D BE ABLE TO
RECREATE THE POWER OF THREE,

08:38.561 --> 08:40.128

FASTER THAN DRIVING.

08:56.797 --> 08:59.756

COME BARGING IN HERE

I'M ASKING ME.

DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW...

10:36.200 --> 10:39.595
YOU WERE AIMING
FOR GRAMS, BUT YOU
WEREN'T SPECIFIC ENOUGH.

10:39.769 --> 10:43.730
SO YOU CAME TO THE
FUTURE, WHERE YOU'RE
THE GRAMS INSTEAD.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.296
[CHUCKLING]
AND...HERE I AM.

10:45.470 --> 10:48.473
WAIT, I'M A...
GRANDMOTHER?

10:48.648 --> 10:51.259
BLOWS YOUR MIND,
DOESN'T IT? MOM?

10:51.433 --> 10:52.869
UH, YEAH.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.436
Leo: ALL RIGHT,
HOLD ON, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND...

10:54.610 --> 10:55.742
HOW YOU KNOW
ALL THIS STUFF,

10:55.916 --> 10:58.701
AND HOW
DID YOU KNOW
WE WOULD COME?

10:58.875 --> 11:01.008
BECAUSE 50 YEARS AGO
WE WERE SITTING THERE,

11:01.182 --> 11:03.837
WHERE YOU'RE
SITTING, TALKING
TO OUR FUTURE SELVES.

11:04.011 --> 11:05.752
THAT'S WHY WE WERE
EXPECTING YOU.
NOW, YOU SURE...

11:05.926 --> 11:07.188
YOU DON'T WANT
SOME COOKIES?

11:07.362 --> 11:09.451
UH, NO.
I THINK I'D
RATHER HAVE ASPIRIN.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.627
[CHUCKLING]
LIKE SHE SAID,

11:11.801 --> 11:13.934
WE WERE EXPECTING YOU.

11:15.326 --> 11:16.937
YOU REMEMBER WHEN
WE WERE THEM?

11:17.111 --> 11:21.202
OH, KICKING BUTT,
FIGHTING DEMONS.

11:21.376 --> 11:24.509
LOSING YOU, GETTING YOU
BACK, LOSING YOU
AGAIN, AYE.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.555
AND IT WAS
ALL WORTH IT.

11:26.729 --> 11:27.599
OH, YOU BET.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.079
OH, THAT'S SO SWEET.

11:29.253 --> 11:31.734
MM-HMM, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M JUST NOT...

11:31.908 --> 11:33.910
QUITE READY
FOR ALL OF THIS,

11:34.084 --> 11:38.175
BESIDES, WE NEED TO GET BACK
TO SAVE PHOEBE AND PAIGE--

11:38.349 --> 11:41.962
RIGHT, AND THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE
GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT,

11:42.136 --> 11:43.311
IS IF YOU--

11:43.485 --> 11:45.008
Grandpa Leo: AH,
DON'T SAY TOO MUCH, HON.

11:45.182 --> 11:47.315
WE DON'T WANT THEM TO
MESS UP THE FUTURE,

11:47.489 --> 11:50.448
WELL, ISN'T IT
ALREADY MESSED UP?

11:50.622 --> 11:52.059
OH, NO, NOT YET.

11:53.321 --> 11:55.671
OH, AND THE FUTURE
IS WORTH SAVING,

11:55.845 --> 11:57.412
BELIEVE ME.

11:57.586 --> 11:59.936
YOU KEEP USING THE RING,

12:00.110 --> 12:02.852
FOCUS ON WHO YOU WANT TO
GO TO WITH OUR HEART,

12:03.026 --> 12:04.419
NOT WITH YOUR HEAD.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.813
Grandpa Leo:
THAT WAY YOU'LL GET
TO YOUR GRAMS,

12:06.987 --> 12:08.728
AND THEN TO
PHOEBE AND PAIGE.

12:08.902 --> 12:11.339
BUT WHAT DO WE DO
WHEN WE GET THERE?

12:11.513 --> 12:12.557
HOW DO WE SAVE THEM?

12:12.732 --> 12:16.257
YOU GET RID OF
THE HOLLOW TOGETHER.

12:27.659 --> 12:29.400
I THINK WE'RE
BACK IN MY TIME.

12:29.574 --> 12:31.011
Woman: YOU WANT
ANOTHER TISSUE?

12:31.185 --> 12:32.360
Girl: NO, I'M OK.

12:32.534 --> 12:35.232
WELL, YOU'RE MORE
THAN OK, SWEETIE.

12:35.406 --> 12:38.845
YOU'RE VERY, VERY
SPECIAL AND YOU
NEED TO KNOW THAT.

12:39.019 --> 12:42.065
Girl: NOT AS SPECIAL
AS PRUE, OR EVEN PHOEBE,

12:42.239 --> 12:43.850
EVERYONE LIKES PHOEBE.

12:44.024 --> 12:46.635
BUT YOU'RE SPECIAL
IN YOUR OWN WAY, PIPER.

12:46.809 --> 12:49.203
I MEAN, YOU'RE KIND
AND CARING,

12:49.377 --> 12:52.075
YOU'RE THE BEST LITTLE
HELPER I'VE GOT.

12:52.249 --> 12:56.297
PLUS, YOU ARE
THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN
KEEP YOUR SISTERS

12:56.471 --> 12:58.560
FROM KILLING EACH OTHER
HALF THE TIME.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.431
[CHUCKLES]

13:00.605 --> 13:03.304
AND YOU MAY
NOT KNOW IT YET,

13:03.478 --> 13:06.873
BUT YOU'VE GOT GIFTS.

13:07.047 --> 13:10.398
THE MOST--THE MOST
AMAZING GIFTS,

13:10.572 --> 13:13.575
AND SOMEDAY,
THOSE GIFTS...

13:13.749 --> 13:15.838
ARE GONNA MAKE YOU
EVEN MORE SPECIAL.

13:16.012 --> 13:17.100
HOW?

13:17.274 --> 13:19.929
WELL, YOU'LL SEE.
[CHUCKLES]

13:21.670 --> 13:24.716
NOW, RUN ON UPSTAIRS AND
PLAY WITH YOUR SISTERS,
OK? WHILE I MAKE DINNER.

13:24.891 --> 13:26.066
OK.
[CHUCKLES]

13:27.241 --> 13:28.503
YOU LOVED
YOUR GRAMS.

13:29.852 --> 13:30.766
WHO'S THERE?

13:31.854 --> 13:33.377
IT'S OK, MOM,
IT'S JUST ME.

13:33.551 --> 13:34.378
NO, MOM.

13:34.552 --> 13:36.859
PATTY?
MM-HMM.

13:38.034 --> 13:41.168
MOM! OH!
WHAT HAPPENED?

13:44.258 --> 13:45.520
WHY'D SHE FAINT?

13:45.694 --> 13:49.872
OH, WELL, PROBABLY
BECAUSE YOU'RE DEAD.

13:53.876 --> 13:56.705
ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS FOCUS
ON SAVING YOUR SISTER,

13:56.879 --> 13:59.882
WHICH MEANS
FOCUSING ON THE BATTLE.

14:00.056 --> 14:01.841
LET'S TRY AGAIN.

14:04.974 --> 14:06.671
CLEAR YOUR MIND
OF EVERYTHING ELSE,

14:06.846 --> 14:08.848
FROM ALL THAT
HAS HAPPENED SINCE.

14:10.893 --> 14:13.461
LET GO OF THE PAIN OF LOSS,

14:13.635 --> 14:16.856
BECAUSE WHERE YOU'RE GOING
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET.

14:18.248 --> 14:20.250
THINK ONLY OF CHRISTY.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.254
SEE HER AT YOUR SIDE.

14:25.429 --> 14:29.303
YOU WANT TO SAVE HER
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

14:29.477 --> 14:32.393
AND THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO DO.

14:34.308 --> 14:36.223
THAT'S IT.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.661
YOU'RE ALMOST THERE.

14:39.835 --> 14:42.446
NOW GO,

14:42.620 --> 14:47.016
PROJECT YOURSELF
BACK TO THE TRIAD.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.847
THE TRIAD?

14:53.327 --> 14:54.894
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:55.068 --> 14:56.199
ARE YOU TRYING TO
TRICK ME?

14:56.373 --> 14:57.635
WHA--NO!
OF COURSE NOT!

14:57.809 --> 14:59.159
THEN WHAT WAS THAT?

14:59.333 --> 15:00.464
YOU SAID I WAS
GOING BACK TO
SEE MY SISTER.

15:00.638 --> 15:03.119
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU.

15:03.293 --> 15:05.556
SHOULD'VE
TOLD ME WHAT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:06.688 --> 15:08.516
WHAT'S GOING ON...

15:08.690 --> 15:10.518
IS THAT IF YOU
DON'T GO BACK TO WARN
THE TRIAD ABOUT THE BATTLE,

15:10.692 --> 15:12.476
THEY WON'T BE ABLE
TO STOP IT,

15:12.650 --> 15:14.914
WHICH MEANS THEY'LL
STILL BE KILLED AND
SO WILL YOUR SISTER!

15:17.307 --> 15:19.353
SO, YOU'RE SAYING
THE TRIAD WAS
STILL ALIVE?

15:21.050 --> 15:21.877
MORE OR LESS.

15:22.051 --> 15:25.141
AND YOU DIDN'T
TELL ME?

15:25.315 --> 15:26.882
SO YOU'VE BEEN
MANIPULATING ME

15:27.056 --> 15:28.536
THIS ENTIRE TIME,
AND CHRISTY, TOO?

15:28.710 --> 15:31.495
CHRISTY UNDERSTANDS
EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON.

15:31.669 --> 15:32.932
AND WHAT
MIGHT THAT BE?

15:33.106 --> 15:35.369
WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK
AND ASK HER YOURSELF?

15:35.543 --> 15:38.894
THEN MAYBE
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND, TOO.

15:46.510 --> 15:49.078
HOW IS SHE?
I THINK
SHE'S COMING TO.

15:49.252 --> 15:51.037
[CHUCKLING]
NO, I MEANT MOM.

15:51.211 --> 15:53.039
OH, I THINK
IT'S MORE

15:53.213 --> 15:55.041
INFORMATION OVERLOAD
THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

15:55.215 --> 15:57.826
YEAH, WELL,
WELCOME TO THE CLUB.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.306
[SIGHS]

16:00.568 --> 16:01.786
WHAT'S WRONG?

16:03.875 --> 16:05.138
NOTHIN'.

16:07.923 --> 16:10.360
I JUST, UH,
I WAS THINKIN' ABOUT--

16:10.534 --> 16:12.580
AFTER YOU GUYS SAY THE SPELL
TO GET RID OF THE HOLLOW.

16:12.754 --> 16:15.104
WELL, HOPEFULLY,
IT'LL WORK.

16:15.278 --> 16:18.499
YEAH, IF IT DOES,
IT MEANS EVERYONE'S
GONNA COME BACK TO LIFE,

16:18.673 --> 16:19.979
INCLUDING
BILLIE AND CHRISTY.

16:20.153 --> 16:22.459
NOT FOR LONG,
NOT IF I HAVE MY WAY.

16:22.633 --> 16:26.289
UNTIL YOU DO IT MEANS THE
ULTIMATE BATTLE WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN FOUGHT YET,

16:26.463 --> 16:29.118
WHICH MEANS THE ANGEL OF
DESTINY MIGHT TAKE ME AWAY
AGAIN UNTIL IT IS.

16:29.292 --> 16:30.990
LISTEN,

16:31.164 --> 16:34.428
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
WE WILL BE PLAYING
SCRABBLE IN THE FUTURE,

16:34.602 --> 16:38.171
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
YOU WILL BE LOSING.

16:38.345 --> 16:41.783
OH, WHAT HAPPENED?
WHERE AM I?

16:41.957 --> 16:43.611
YOU'RE OK, MOM.
YOU JUST FAINTED.

16:43.785 --> 16:47.049
WELL, OF COURSE I FAINTED.
YOU'RE DEAD.

16:47.223 --> 16:50.444
OH, YEAH, I KNOW,
THEY JUST TOLD ME.

16:50.618 --> 16:51.619
HI.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.143
AND WHO ARE YOU?

16:54.317 --> 16:58.626
WELL, BELIEVE IT
OR NOT, I AM PIPER.

16:58.800 --> 17:02.282
FROM THE FUTURE, AND
THIS IS MY LOVELY
HUSBAND LEO...

17:02.456 --> 17:04.023
FROM THE FUTURE
AS WELL.

17:04.197 --> 17:06.590
BUT I'M FROM THE
PAST, OBVIOUSLY.

17:10.899 --> 17:12.205
I NEED A DRINK.

17:12.379 --> 17:13.293
OH, MOM.

17:13.467 --> 17:14.555
OK, GRAMS,
RELAX.

17:14.729 --> 17:16.513
I KNOW THIS IS ALL
VERY COMPLICATED,

17:16.687 --> 17:17.906
BUT WE DON'T HAVE
TIME TO EXPLAIN.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.429
SOMETHING VERY BAD
HAS HAPPENED

17:19.603 --> 17:21.518
IN THE FUTURE
AND WE NEED YOUR
HELP TO FIX IT.

17:21.692 --> 17:24.391
WE HAVE TO SAVE
HER SISTERS, MOM.

17:24.565 --> 17:28.612
WE HAVE TO SAVE
THE CHARMED ONES.

17:28.786 --> 17:30.701
THE CHARMED ONES?

17:30.875 --> 17:31.833

17:33.052 --> 17:35.750
YOU BECOME
THE CHARMED ONES?

17:35.924 --> 17:37.012

17:38.840 --> 17:40.146
WHAT DO WE
HAVE TO DO?

WELL, I'M FROM THE FUTURE,
I CAME BACK TO WARN YOU--

18:15.094 --> 18:17.226
ME, NOT TO DO THIS.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.055
NO, NO, I'M SERIOUS, YOU'RE
GONNA GET YOURSELF KILLED.
THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK.

18:22.057 --> 18:24.233

18:35.592 --> 18:37.899
WE'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR YOU.

IS OVER.

DON'T SEE EVERY DAY.

WHAT IS GOING ON?

19:40.091 --> 19:41.441

CAUGHT UP WITH ITSELF.

HOW DID EVERYBODY
GET HERE?

19:44.487 --> 19:46.489
WELL, ACTUALLY,

19:46.663 --> 19:48.317
YOU HAVE COOP
TO THANK FOR THAT.

WHAT HAPPENED,
WHAT WENT WRONG?

OH, DAMN IT.

20:39.629 --> 20:40.674
OK, SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

20:40.848 --> 20:42.632
BECAUSE YOU GUYS

IN TIME BY SAVING US--

20:46.549 --> 20:48.508

BECAUSE OF ALL THAT,
WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO
HAPPEN AFTER THIS--

20:52.251 --> 20:53.687
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?

EXACTLY, THAT KIND
OF MAKES THIS,

THOUGH A DIFFERENT
PAST THAN MINE.

GETTING ANY OF THIS?

AS LONG AS WE'RE
ALIVE AGAIN.

21:06.526 --> 21:07.875
THAT'S ALL
I CARE ABOUT,

21:08.049 --> 21:10.399
PLUS, IT'S
REALLY NICE TO
SEE YOU GUYS AGAIN.

21:10.573 --> 21:11.922
ACTUALLY,
WE'VE NEVER MET.

21:12.096 --> 21:14.360
YEAH, WE HAVE,
BUT YOU WERE A GHOST.

21:15.491 --> 21:17.319
OH--DOES
SHE KNOW?

21:17.493 --> 21:21.062
YES, YES, WE KNOW,
WE'RE BOTH DEAD BY
NOW, WE'RE OVER IT.

21:21.236 --> 21:22.542
NO, SPEAK
FOR YOURSELF.

21:22.716 --> 21:24.326
OK, THE PROBLEM IS...

21:24.500 --> 21:27.242
WE'RE STILL RIGHT BACK TO
WHERE WE STARTED WITH LEO,

21:27.416 --> 21:30.289

HAVE THAT FUTURE,
THAT I SAW WITH HIM--

21:30.463 --> 21:31.899
WAIT, YOU WENT
TO THE FUTURE, TOO?

21:32.073 --> 21:33.944
WE SURE DID MISS A LOT
WHEN WE WERE DEAD.

21:34.118 --> 21:37.208
ANYWAY, THE POINT IS
IF I'M GONNA GET
MY HUSBAND BACK,

21:37.383 --> 21:38.949
WE HAVE A BATTLE TO FINISH.

21:39.123 --> 21:41.125
AND WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GET MOM
HOME SAFELY,

21:41.300 --> 21:43.258

WON'T BE BORN.

21:45.086 --> 21:47.306

THERE ANY OTHER PROBLEMS

DOING HERE?

UP OUR FUTURE.

22:04.235 --> 22:07.282

NEED DUMAIN'S HELP IF WE'RE
GONNA FINISH WHAT WE STARTED.

LISTENING TO ME?

22:09.197 --> 22:11.460

PROBABLY SINCE WE MET HIM.

22:11.634 --> 22:13.462

GET TO THE HOLLOW
SOONER THIS TIME,

22:13.636 --> 22:14.942

LISTEN.
FIGURE OUT A WAY.

22:15.116 --> 22:16.552
WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

22:16.726 --> 22:18.946
DUMAIN IS
USING US, OK?

22:19.120 --> 22:20.426
AND HE'S NOT
THE ONLY ONE,

22:20.600 --> 22:21.514
THE TRIAD IS ALSO.

22:21.688 --> 22:23.080
YES, THAT'S RIGHT,

22:23.254 --> 22:24.821
THEY'RE STILL ALIVE,

22:24.995 --> 22:27.215
OR THEY WERE, BUT
DUMAIN DIDN'T TELL
US THAT, DID HE?

22:27.389 --> 22:28.999
INSTEAD HE
TRIED TO TRICK ME,

22:29.173 --> 22:30.958
INTO SAVING THEM
INSTEAD OF YOU.

22:31.132 --> 22:32.263
WELL, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO HIM.

22:32.438 --> 22:34.135
WHAT?
THE TRIAD...

22:34.309 --> 22:36.616
COULD'VE HELPED US
FIGURE OUT HOW TO
KILL THE SISTERS

22:36.790 --> 22:38.705
IF THEY WERE
STILL AROUND.

22:38.879 --> 22:39.967
OK, LOOK AT ME,

22:40.141 --> 22:41.751
LISTEN TO ME
VERY CAREFULLY.

22:41.925 --> 22:43.536
THEY DON'T CARE
ABOUT US.

22:43.710 --> 22:46.800
THEY HAVE TWISTED
EVERYTHING. THEY'RE
USING US, CHRISTY.

22:46.974 --> 22:48.584
THEIR USING US
FOR OUR POWERS,
OUR SISTERHOOD,

22:48.758 --> 22:51.631
AND OUR LIVES SO ALL
WE CAN DO IS KILL.

22:51.805 --> 22:53.937
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
WE'RE GOING TO DO, BILLIE,

22:54.111 --> 22:55.025
WE'RE GOING TO KILL.

22:55.199 --> 22:58.377
WELL, I CAN'T DO IT.
I WON'T.

22:59.552 --> 23:00.553
THEN I'LL DO IT ON MY OWN.

23:03.469 --> 23:04.948
CHRISTY!

23:06.950 --> 23:08.517
GOD.

23:12.042 --> 23:13.827
I MEAN, WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED, ONE MINUTE,

23:14.001 --> 23:15.481
EVERYTHING'S FINE,
WE'RE KICKING
DEMON ASS, AND--

23:15.655 --> 23:16.699
ACTUALLY, I WAS
KICKING SOME DEMON--

23:16.873 --> 23:18.701
OH, PSHH--
WATCH YOUR
LANGUAGE.

23:18.875 --> 23:20.355
SORRY, GRAMS.

23:20.529 --> 23:23.532

AS IN "THE" GRAMS?
YEAH.

23:23.706 --> 23:25.273
UH, CONFUSED.

23:25.447 --> 23:28.276
ARE THESE MY FUTURE
GRANDKIDS OR YOURS?

23:28.450 --> 23:29.364
NO, YOURS.

23:30.496 --> 23:31.410
OH, HI.

23:33.324 --> 23:34.630
AS YOU WERE SAYING.

23:34.804 --> 23:36.545
SUDDENLY, IN THE MIDDLE
OF ALL THE FIGHTING,

23:36.719 --> 23:38.547
EVERYTHING CHANGED.

23:38.721 --> 23:41.158
AND THE DEMONS STARTED
KICKING OUR ASS--
BUTTS, BUTTS,

23:41.332 --> 23:43.160
JUST BECAUSE WYATT HERE
LOST HIS POWERS.

23:43.334 --> 23:45.119
WAIT, HOW DID YOU
LOSE YOUR POWERS?

23:45.293 --> 23:46.903
THAT'S THE THING,
WE DON'T KNOW.

23:47.077 --> 23:49.863
SO WE CAST A SPELL
TO TAKE US BACK TO
WHEN THEY WERE LOST,

23:50.037 --> 23:51.734
AND IT TOOK US...
HERE, TO YOU.

23:51.908 --> 23:53.780
MAYBE WE
MESSED UP SOMETHING
WITHOUT REALIZING IT.

23:53.954 --> 23:55.869
WELL, WITH
ALL THE JUMPING
AROUND WE'VE DONE,

23:56.043 --> 23:57.566
IT'S A WONDER
EVERYTHING'S
NOT MESSED UP.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.699
NO, IT'S GOTTA BE
BILLIE AND CHRISTY,

23:59.873 --> 24:02.310
THEY USED THE HOLLOW
TO STEAL HIS POWERS.

24:02.484 --> 24:04.181
I'M GONNA KILL THEM.

24:04.355 --> 24:07.663
WELL, BEFORE YOU DO
THAT, WE NEED TO GET
WYATT'S POWERS BACK,

24:07.837 --> 24:10.100
OTHERWISE, THERE'S...
NOT GOING TO BE ANY
FUTURE TO SAVE.

24:10.274 --> 24:13.321
WELL, I THINK THE ONLY
WAY TO DO THAT IS TO GO
BACK AND STOP THEM.

24:13.495 --> 24:16.672
BUT HOW DO WE KNOW
EXACTLY WHEN TO
GO BACK TO?

24:16.846 --> 24:20.328
I'LL KNOW, OR AT LEAST
I'M HOPING LITTLE WYATT
MIGHT JOG MY MEMORY.

24:20.502 --> 24:22.548
WELL, HE'S AT DAD'S, I MEAN,

24:22.722 --> 24:24.941

24:25.115 --> 24:27.204
DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW TO GET THERE?

24:27.378 --> 24:28.249
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

24:28.423 --> 24:29.859
I'LL GO, TOO.

24:30.033 --> 24:31.034
UM, BUT DAD'S
GONNA BE THERE.

[CHUCKLING]
I KNOW, I MISS HIM.

24:33.733 --> 24:36.910
BESIDES, I'M DYING TO KNOW
WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE
AT THIS AGE, WHOO.

24:37.084 --> 24:40.087
SHE, UH, DOESN'T KNOW.

24:40.261 --> 24:43.090
APPARENTLY, I HADN'T
CHASED HIM AWAY YET.

24:43.264 --> 24:46.833
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING--?
WHAT DON'T I KNOW?

24:48.225 --> 24:50.924
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY GO,
BUT JUST, YOU KNOW,

24:51.098 --> 24:52.708

25:27.395 --> 25:30.616
OK, LET'S GET TO THE CONDO,

YEAH, YOU'LL GET OVER IT,
I DID. [CHUCKLES]

26:20.535 --> 26:22.015

26:24.713 --> 26:28.151
DIDN'T ANYONE TELL
HER WE'RE DIVORCED?

26:28.325 --> 26:30.980
WHAT?

26:32.678 --> 26:34.549
YOU DUMPED ME, FOR
YOUR WHITE LIGHTER.

26:37.813 --> 26:39.728
LISTEN, GRAMS,
WE'RE IN A BIT OF A JAM,
WHERE'S LITTLE WYATT?

26:39.902 --> 26:42.339
HE'S IN
THE OTHER ROOM,

26:42.513 --> 26:43.950

26:45.952 --> 26:48.519
OH, COME ON, PATTY,
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

26:48.694 --> 26:51.174
IT WAS A LONG
TIME AGO.

26:51.348 --> 26:54.569
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BILLIE'S NOT COMING?
WE NEED HER.

26:54.743 --> 26:56.789
WE CAN DEFEAT
THE CHARMED ONES
WITHOUT HER.

26:56.963 --> 26:58.225
NO, WE CAN'T.

26:58.399 --> 26:59.835
WE NEED THE TRIAD
TO DO THAT,

27:00.009 --> 27:02.098
AND WE NEED HER
POWER TO GO BACK
AND SAVE THEM.

27:02.272 --> 27:04.231

THERE'S ANOTHER WAY.

27:07.538 --> 27:11.586

27:14.937 --> 27:16.896
IT'S BILLIE AND CHRISTY,
THEY'RE NOT DEMONS.

27:17.070 --> 27:19.812
WELL, THEY MIGHT AS WELL
BE, FROM EVERYTHING
YOU'VE TOLD ME,

27:19.986 --> 27:22.510
WHICH MEANS
WE CAN'T TAKE
ANY CHANCES.

I'M LOOKING FOR MY WIFE.

27:51.321 --> 27:52.409
SHE DIDN'T COME HOME
LAST NIGHT.

27:52.583 --> 27:53.584
ARE YOU OK?

27:53.759 --> 27:55.935
YES, I'M OK,
OF COURSE I'M OK.

27:56.109 --> 27:59.373
I MEAN, WE WEREN'T OK, OK.
BUT NOW WE'RE OK...

27:59.547 --> 28:01.767
AND I THINK IN THE FUTURE
WE'RE GONNA BE--

28:01.941 --> 28:03.638
I THINK WE'RE
GONNA BE MORE THAN OK.

28:05.074 --> 28:06.510
OK.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.425
DON'T TELL ME

I LET YOU KICK

UNTIL YOU,

IT, I KNOW WHAT

FOR WHAT I'VE DONE
TO YOU GUYS,

30:00.581 --> 30:02.365

I JUST WANTED MY SISTER
BACK SO BADLY,

SHE WAS MANIPULATING ME.

30:07.762 --> 30:10.373
WELL, THAT'S
VERY CONVENIENT,

30:10.547 --> 30:12.245
BUT HOW ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO KNOW
THIS ISN'T A TRAP?

LET HER TALK.

WE WERE DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

30:28.609 --> 30:30.132
THEY USED US,
THEY USED CHRISTY,

30:30.306 --> 30:32.221
THEY HAVE SPENT
THE LAST 15 YEARS...

30:32.395 --> 30:34.049

THAT'S ALL THEY'VE
CARED ABOUT, THAT'S
ALL THEY'VE WANTED.

30:36.182 --> 30:37.792
WE'VE ALREADY
VANQUISHED THE TRIAD.

AND FIND A WAY TO
BRING THEM BACK,

30:57.464 --> 30:58.944
SHE WANTED TO STAY
WITH GRANDPA TO TALK.

HAD BETTER BE ALL
THAT THEY'RE DOING.

31:02.730 --> 31:04.471
WHAT DID YOU FIND?

31:04.645 --> 31:06.690

THAT SOMEONE CAME AND
PICKED UP LITTLE WY,

TO SUMMON THE HOLLOW.

STOLE HIS POWERS.

HAVE A CHOICE.

OK, SO WE HAVE TO GO
BACK IN TIME TO THE DAY

BEFORE THAT,

HE'S GONNA
WARN THE TRIAD BEFORE
YOU CAN VANQUISH THEM.

GET THE RING.

FIND LOVE, BUT TO
HELP YOU FIND HIM.

THEY WERE HOPING
YOU'D FALL IN LOVE
WITH A CUPID,

IT WAS THE ONLY WAY THAT THEY
COULD MAKE IT UP TO YOU AFTER
EVERYTHING YOU SACRIFICED.

32:04.183 --> 32:06.663
AND THEY WEREN'T GONNA
PUT YOU THROUGH WHAT MOM
AND DAD WENT THROUGH, SO...

33:56.251 --> 33:58.645
CHRISTY, PLEASE,

33:58.819 --> 34:02.431
IT'S OVER,
JUST COME HOME.

34:09.525 --> 34:12.137
[SCREECHES]

34:13.790 --> 34:17.664
[SOBBING]

34:37.727 --> 34:38.902
OH, THANK GOD.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.730
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
DID ANYTHING...

34:40.904 --> 34:42.645
CHANGE THAT
WASN'T SUPPOSED TO?

34:42.819 --> 34:44.256
NOPE.

34:47.128 --> 34:48.869
I GOT
MY POWERS BACK.

34:49.043 --> 34:50.349
I SEE THAT.

34:50.523 --> 34:52.090
NOW,
WHERE'S BILLIE?

34:52.264 --> 34:53.917
SHE USED HER OWN
POWER TO GET BACK.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.876
BUT SHE AT LEAST
TRIED TO HELP OUT, RIGHT?

34:56.050 --> 34:57.486
I MEAN, TRIED TO
MAKE AMENDS AT LEAST.

34:57.660 --> 34:58.879
YEAH.

35:09.890 --> 35:11.370
OK, HANG ON A SECOND,

35:11.544 --> 35:13.981
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TAKE
HIM AWAY AGAIN, RIGHT?

35:14.155 --> 35:18.028
NO, THIS IS
THE WAY THE BATTLE WAS
SUPPOSED TO END ALL ALONG,

35:18.203 --> 35:21.815
AND IT'S OVER,
CONGRATULATIONS.

35:26.167 --> 35:28.343
HI THERE.
[GIGGLING]

35:29.518 --> 35:30.693
[CLAPPING]
YAY!
[GIGGLING]

35:42.183 --> 35:43.706
DID WE
MISS ANYTHING?

35:43.880 --> 35:45.360
UH, NO.

35:45.534 --> 35:48.233
WELL, WE...
CHANGED THE PAST,
FIXED THE FUTURE,

35:48.407 --> 35:50.539
AND SAVED THE PRESENT,
THAT'S ALL.

35:50.713 --> 35:52.672
WHAT'S THAT?

35:52.846 --> 35:55.936
YEAH, IF YOU HAVEN'T
FIGURED IT OUT BY NOW,
YA PROBABLY WON'T.

35:56.110 --> 35:58.156
OH, IT DOESN'T MATTER,
JUST AS LONG AS
EVERYTHING'S

35:58.330 --> 35:59.853
BACK TO THE WAY
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

36:00.027 --> 36:04.423
IT WILL BE IF YOU
GET US BACK, I MEAN,
OTHERWISE, UH--

36:04.597 --> 36:06.642
HOW ARE WE GONNA
GET THEM BACK?

36:06.816 --> 36:08.383
OH, I CAN
TAKE CARE OF THAT.

36:08.557 --> 36:09.993
YEAH, BUT HOW WILL
YOU KNOW WHERE TO
TAKE THEM BACK TO?

36:10.168 --> 36:13.475
WELL, THE RING WILL.
IF I CAN EVER GET IT BACK.

36:13.649 --> 36:16.086
JUST MAKE SURE
YOU RETURN THEM JUST
BEFORE THEY WERE TAKEN,

36:16.261 --> 36:18.306
THAT WAY THEY
WON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.917
OH, NO, DON'T DO
THAT. I MEAN, THERE
ARE SO MANY THINGS,

36:21.091 --> 36:22.745
WONDERFUL THINGS
THAT I JUST DON'T
WANNA FORGET,

36:22.919 --> 36:24.182
YOU KNOW.
[GIGGLES]

36:24.356 --> 36:27.620
THERE'S JUST AS MUCH
I DON'T EVER WANNA KNOW,

36:27.794 --> 36:29.143
LIKE WHAT
HAPPENED TO PRUE.

36:30.231 --> 36:31.276
VICTOR TOLD ME.

36:31.450 --> 36:33.103
OH, MOM.

36:33.278 --> 36:38.631
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I KNOW EVERYTHING
HAPPENS FOR A REASON.

36:38.805 --> 36:40.676
I BELIEVE THAT.

36:42.156 --> 36:45.203
I ALSO KNOW THAT
WHEN ONE DOOR CLOSES
ANOTHER ONE OPENS.

36:49.468 --> 36:53.167
THANK YOU
FOR COMING BY.
ANYTIME.

36:59.304 --> 37:01.175
AHH.
[GIGGLING]

37:06.789 --> 37:08.008
[LAUGHING]

37:29.203 --> 37:31.336
DON'T TELL ME
WE HAVE TO GO
FIGHT A DEMON.

37:31.510 --> 37:34.513
NO, I DON'T THINK
WE'LL HAVE TO DO
THAT ANYTIME SOON.

37:35.688 --> 37:36.558
THEN, WHAT'S
WITH THE BOOK?

37:36.732 --> 37:38.865
WELL, I THINK
WE SHOULD...

37:39.039 --> 37:40.214
WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN.

37:40.388 --> 37:41.998
EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED,

37:42.172 --> 37:44.479
EVERYTHING WE WANT
FUTURE GENERATIONS
TO KNOW,

37:44.653 --> 37:46.220
SO THAT WE CAN
PASS IT DOWN,

37:46.394 --> 37:48.962
JUST LIKE IT WAS
PASSED DOWN TO US.

37:50.659 --> 37:52.139
AFTER YOU.

38:09.678 --> 38:14.640
SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED OVER
THE LAST 8 YEARS, SO MUCH
HAS BEEN GAINED AND LOST,

38:14.814 --> 38:18.774
STILL, IN SOME WAYS,
I FEEL LIKE MY LIFE
IS REALLY JUST BEGINNING.

38:18.948 --> 38:23.083
DO YOU, PHOEBE HALLIWELL,
TAKE THIS MAN TO BE YOUR
LAWFULLY WEDDED HUSBAND?

38:23.257 --> 38:24.389
I DO.

38:24.563 --> 38:26.129
Phoebe: AND IT WAS.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.914
AND THOUGH
I HAD LOVED BEFORE,

38:28.088 --> 38:31.047
I'D NEVER REALLY KNOWN LOVE,
UNTIL I MET COOP.

38:31.221 --> 38:32.875
A MAN WHO I SHARED
THIS SPECIAL LITTLE GIRL...

38:33.049 --> 38:35.356
YES, I AM OK.

38:35.530 --> 38:36.749
Phoebe: ...I HAD LONG AGO
FORESEEN, BUT FEARED
I MIGHT NEVER HAVE.

38:36.923 --> 38:39.229
MOMMY,
WE LOVE YOU!
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

38:39.404 --> 38:42.798
Phoebe: ALONG WITH
TWO OTHER SPECIAL LITTLE
GIRLS, I HAD NOT FORESEEN.

38:42.972 --> 38:45.845
I WAS SUDDENLY
SO BLESSED TO HAVE
A NEW FAMILY OF MY OWN,

38:46.019 --> 38:47.760
AND OLD FRIENDS TO SHARE.

38:47.934 --> 38:50.415
BYE, MOMMY!

38:50.589 --> 38:54.636
Phoebe: AND THOUGH I
KEPT WORKING AND GIVING
ADVICE TO THOSE WHO ASKED,

38:54.810 --> 38:57.639
I WAS MORE INTERESTED
IN HELPING THEM FIND LOVE,

38:57.813 --> 39:00.033
SINCE, FINALLY,
HAVING BEEN LOVED.

39:00.207 --> 39:03.645
Paige: PHOEBE HAD
BECOME SOMEWHAT OF
AN EXPERT ON THE SUBJECT.

39:03.819 --> 39:08.650
AS FOR ME? LIFE WITHOUT DEMONS
OPENED UP SIMILAR AVENUES.

39:08.824 --> 39:11.914
HENRY, OF COURSE, CONTINUED TO
LOOK AFTER HIS PAROLEES,

39:12.088 --> 39:14.395
EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T WANT
TO BE LOOKED AFTER,

39:14.569 --> 39:18.225
WHILE STILL MAKING TIME
TO HELP ME WITH LITTLE
HENRY AND THE TWINS.

39:18.399 --> 39:20.662
THERE'S AN ARROW!

39:20.836 --> 39:23.535
WHICH ALLOWED ME TIME
TO FINALLY EMBRACE
MY INNER WHITELIGHTER.

39:23.709 --> 39:25.580
ARROW!

39:25.754 --> 39:28.191
OHH!

39:28.366 --> 39:30.672
Paige: AND TO HELP
THE NEXT GENERATION OF
WITCHES COME INTO THEIR OWN.

39:30.846 --> 39:33.588
Piper: SO THAT PAIGE COULD PASS ON ALL THAT SHE'D LEARNED,

39:33.762 --> 39:37.113
NOT JUST TO HER OWN CHILDREN,
OR TO MINE, OR TO PHOEBE'S...

39:37.287 --> 39:39.681
SEE YOU LATER--

39:39.855 --> 39:42.249
Piper: ...BUT TO
OTHER FUTURE WITCHES
AND WHITE LIGHTERS AS WELL.

39:42.423 --> 39:45.165
WHICH FILLED
THE TIME BETWEEN WHEN
WE WERE DOING THE FIGHTING,

39:45.339 --> 39:48.516
AND WHEN OUR KIDS WERE
OLD ENOUGH TO TAKE OVER,

39:48.690 --> 39:50.997
ALLOWING ME TIME TO
GET BACK TO MY ROOTS

39:51.171 --> 39:53.782
AND COOK SOMETHING
OTHER THAN POTIONS, FOR ONCE.

39:53.956 --> 39:57.960
AND OPEN THE RESTAURANT
I'D ALWAYS DREAMED OF OWNING.

39:58.134 --> 40:01.007
AS FOR LEO, AFTER
WE RECLAIMED MAGIC SCHOOL,

40:01.181 --> 40:02.530
HE WENT BACK TO TEACHING.

40:02.704 --> 40:03.575
SO WHO'D LIKE TO
TRY IT FIRST?

40:03.749 --> 40:05.359
ME!
I DO!
I DO!

40:07.492 --> 40:11.191
Piper: WHICH HE CONTINUED TO DO
UNTIL IT WAS TIME TO RETIRE.

40:11.365 --> 40:13.323
AWESOME.
GREAT JOB, MATTHEW.

40:13.498 --> 40:16.239
Old Piper: AND ALTHOUGH WE
CERTAINLY HAD OUR STRUGGLES...

40:16.414 --> 40:19.678
"AND HEARTACHES
OVER THE YEARS, WE'RE
A FAMILY OF SURVIVORS,

40:19.852 --> 40:22.202
"AND WE WILL ALWAYS BE,

40:22.376 --> 40:24.726
"WHICH IS WHY
WE'VE TRULY...

40:24.900 --> 40:26.728
BEEN CHARMED".

40:26.902 --> 40:28.904
AGAIN,
GRANDMAMMA,
AGAIN.

40:29.078 --> 40:30.906
[CHUCKLING]
OH, DEAR.

40:31.080 --> 40:33.735
NO, I CAN'T.
I NEED TO REST.

40:33.909 --> 40:37.870
BUT YOU CAN LOOK AT IT
FOR A LITTLE WHILE
IF YOU'D LIKE, HMM?

40:39.524 --> 40:41.961
AFTER ALL,

40:42.135 --> 40:44.833
IT'LL BE
YOURS ONE DAY.
