02:01.086 --> 02:05.546
No! No! No! No! No!

02:05.624 --> 02:08.854
- No! No!
- Die!

02:54.707 --> 02:57.733
<i>Colonel Redding.
Now there's a piece of work.</i>

02:57.810 --> 03:01.405
<i>I can't believe he's having us
wire up this hellhole.</i>

03:01.481 --> 03:05.383
<i>He's obsessed with something.
What's he expecting to find down there?</i>

03:05.451 --> 03:07.749
Ghosts of old miners?

03:07.820 --> 03:11.916
They're here!
Hey.

03:11.991 --> 03:14.289
You ready to test 'em?

03:14.360 --> 03:16.294
All right. You got everybody?

03:16.362 --> 03:19.263
Number one's dead.

03:19.332 --> 03:21.493
Oh.

03:24.303 --> 03:26.294
How about now?

03:26.372 --> 03:29.933
<i>- Whoa. Good there.
- How about the security dummies?</i>

03:30.009 --> 03:33.240
They're dead too.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.606
Hold on.

03:37.917 --> 03:40.044
<i>What the hell?</i>

03:41.687 --> 03:43.746
<i>What you got?</i>

03:43.823 --> 03:47.020
<i>- I got a shitload of false readings. Stand by.
- Again?</i>

03:47.093 --> 03:50.028
<i>- What's going on in here?
- Damn it!</i>

03:52.498 --> 03:56.127
- We just lost our feed.
- I'll go check the main junction.

03:58.237 --> 04:01.035
<i>Spooky down there, isn't it?</i>

04:01.107 --> 04:05.271
<i>We were the first ones
in there since the '50s.</i>

04:05.344 --> 04:09.007
<i>Maybe it is haunted.
Glad it's you and not me in there.</i>

04:41.380 --> 04:46.682
Aw, fuck!

04:46.752 --> 04:50.313
<i>- What's with the junction box?
- It's history.</i>

04:50.389 --> 04:52.914
Our friends the rats again.

04:52.992 --> 04:55.256
They love the taste
of the insulation.

04:55.328 --> 05:00.766
All right, I'll call base. Should be able
to get a backup here in an hour or so. Shit.

05:03.469 --> 05:06.097
Dr. Wilson,
have you seen Foster?

05:06.172 --> 05:09.699
Calibrating the infrared sensor
up top the mountain.

05:09.775 --> 05:12.676
- Dumb sons of bitches.
- Sorry, Colonel Redding.

05:12.745 --> 05:15.942
<i>Guys aren't supposed to be here
without a goddamn escort!</i>

05:24.190 --> 05:26.181
Wilson.

05:28.127 --> 05:30.061
Wilson?

05:30.129 --> 05:32.654
<i>Wilson, come in.</i>

05:41.474 --> 05:44.375
<i>Where are these guys?</i>

05:44.443 --> 05:47.708
<i>Han, do you read me? It's Foster.</i>

05:49.081 --> 05:51.777
<i>Han, come in.</i>

05:53.152 --> 05:55.245
<i>Han, it's Foster.</i>

05:58.457 --> 06:01.119
Hi.

06:03.529 --> 06:06.760
Are you... lost?

06:09.468 --> 06:11.936
My name is Dr. Foster.
Uh-

06:13.139 --> 06:17.166
Do you- Do you have a name?

06:19.378 --> 06:22.643
- "Roonawee."
- "Roonawee"?

06:22.715 --> 06:25.343
- Run away!
- Run away?

06:30.656 --> 06:32.647
Foster?

06:37.363 --> 06:39.524
Foster!

06:41.601 --> 06:44.001
<i>Now, where are you?
Come on.</i>

06:44.070 --> 06:47.904
Come out of your holes.

06:47.974 --> 06:51.637
Come on, you cocksucker
motherfucker sons of bitches!

06:54.046 --> 06:56.310
Foster!

07:41.861 --> 07:46.195
- Go! Go! Move out! Move out! Go!
- Keep moving! Keep mov-

07:46.265 --> 07:49.564
<i>Go!</i>

07:49.635 --> 07:51.603
- Oh, shit!
- Take cover!

07:51.671 --> 07:54.196
<i>Come on, Crank!</i>

07:54.273 --> 07:57.731
- Whoa!
- Ow!

07:57.810 --> 08:01.712
- Leave it!
- I gotta get my helmet.

08:01.781 --> 08:04.443
<i>Spitter, forget your fucking helmet!
Get back here!</i>

08:06.385 --> 08:08.945
- It's not supposed to be this bad!
- Die!

08:09.021 --> 08:12.513
<i>- America's mothers suck cock!
- What the fuck did you say?</i>

08:12.591 --> 08:14.752
<i>- Your American mothers suck cock!
- Uh, Crank?</i>

08:14.827 --> 08:18.388
<i>Fuck you!
America number one, bitch!</i>

08:18.464 --> 08:20.955
<i>Crank, no! No!</i>

08:23.135 --> 08:25.501
- Crank!
- Let's move, pussies!

08:25.571 --> 08:29.905
Crank, you dumb motherfucker!
Don't freak out!

08:34.380 --> 08:37.008
<i>- I know what to do. Get out of the way.
- Give him some cover!</i>

08:37.082 --> 08:39.176
<i>- I got this. I got this.
- You get out!</i>

08:39.251 --> 08:41.981
<i>- This is fortress of Allah!
- Napoleon, get the door.</i>

08:42.054 --> 08:43.988
<i>- What?
- Get the door, man!</i>

08:44.056 --> 08:47.025
- I can't hear you!
- Get the fuckin' door!
- Fuck!

08:47.093 --> 08:49.789
<i>- This is the mother of all doors!
- Fall back!</i>

08:49.862 --> 08:52.194
- Shit! Take cover!
- Run!

08:52.264 --> 08:55.097
Shit!

09:00.005 --> 09:03.099
Mama!

09:03.175 --> 09:05.803
<i>You killed my babies!</i>

09:08.681 --> 09:11.673
<i>- You killed my babies! You killed my babies!
- Watch out.</i>

09:11.751 --> 09:13.946
<i>- Watch her.
- We didn't mean to.</i>

09:14.019 --> 09:17.386
- No! Napoleon!
- Kaboom!

09:17.456 --> 09:20.516
Oh, you're dead.

09:20.593 --> 09:22.561
Idiot!

09:22.628 --> 09:28.123
A stunning display of
individual and group stupidity.

09:28.200 --> 09:32.193
Seventeen civilians killed,
and yourselves.

09:32.271 --> 09:34.865
I'm in fucking awe!

09:34.940 --> 09:39.036
Cole! Never leave cover
to retrieve your helmet!

09:39.111 --> 09:40.908
You won't have a head
to put it on anyway.

09:40.980 --> 09:45.542
<i>Johnson, do not drop your weapon
to protect your ears.</i>

09:45.618 --> 09:47.848
You are better off
deaf than dead.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.219
Medina, since you are not
Rambo resurrected...

09:51.290 --> 09:54.088
do not charge while
your head is securely up your ass.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.755
That's how innocent people get killed.
And you, Napoleon.

09:57.830 --> 10:02.199
- It's Napoli, Sarge.
- You're quite the killer, aren't you, Napoleon?

10:02.268 --> 10:04.896
Almost got your whole squad
blown to hell in six seconds.

10:04.970 --> 10:08.098
<i>That's a mighty impressive body count
for somebody who's against the war.</i>

10:08.174 --> 10:11.166
- What?
- Oh, yeah. Your brother didn't tell you?

10:11.243 --> 10:13.438
Pretty mouth here's
got himself a bumper sticker.

10:13.512 --> 10:17.004
It says,
"Conversation, not confrontation."

10:17.082 --> 10:20.609
- What's up with that shit?
- You against the war, Doonesbury?

10:20.686 --> 10:23.917
Not all wars, Sarge. I just think
that the president lies too much.

10:23.989 --> 10:27.117
All presidents lie, asshole!
That's their fucking job.

10:27.193 --> 10:31.186
- Yes, sir.
- No president has told the truth since Truman.

10:31.263 --> 10:33.288
- And do you know what he said?
- No, Sarge.

10:33.365 --> 10:37.233
<i>He said that
the buck stops here!</i>

10:37.303 --> 10:40.238
Now, you have all
failed combat...

10:40.306 --> 10:42.240
and are therefore
officially dead.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.708
Congratu-fucking-lations.

10:44.777 --> 10:47.211
Fall in at that deuce and a half
with all gear.

10:47.279 --> 10:49.907
<i>We will deploy to the
Agave Ridge rifle range.</i>

10:49.982 --> 10:52.746
There, you can complete your
failure of these exercises...

10:52.818 --> 10:55.844
by blowin' each other's
dead heads off!

10:55.921 --> 10:58.822
And on our way,
we're stopping at Sector 16...

10:58.891 --> 11:01.792
to deliver equipment to scientists
who are working there.

11:01.861 --> 11:06.560
This is a top secret area,
so do not wander off or talk to anybody.

11:06.632 --> 11:10.398
Now, get your sorry rookie butts
in the back of that truck, now!

11:10.469 --> 11:12.403
Let's go! Let's go!

11:12.471 --> 11:16.271
Let's go, Spitter! If I had some steak
on a string, you'd move real fast!

11:40.332 --> 11:43.927
Jesus!
How big is this place?

11:44.003 --> 11:48.599
It's about 1,300 square miles.
They used to test nuclear weapons here.

11:48.674 --> 11:52.110
Well, isn't it radioactive then?

11:52.177 --> 11:55.806
- Not according to the army.
- Fuck.

11:57.416 --> 11:59.441
<i>Maybe I should thank Napoleon.</i>

11:59.518 --> 12:02.954
<i>If we're all officially dead
like Sarge said...</i>

12:03.022 --> 12:05.752
<i>I won't be tried
for war crimes.</i>

12:05.824 --> 12:08.850
The killing of innocent mannequins
is serious shit.

12:08.928 --> 12:11.453
<i>- Where I come from, it's never good to be dead.
- Aw, Crank.</i>

12:11.530 --> 12:13.964
You're takin' all the fun
out of the afterlife.

12:14.033 --> 12:16.558
Shove the afterlife up your ass.

12:16.635 --> 12:19.798
<i>- That's cold, man.
- Clyde, huh?</i>

12:19.872 --> 12:24.172
Made the same mistake when I was a kid.
So is Clyde still your dude?

12:24.243 --> 12:27.041
Uh, yeah, Stump.
Clyde's still my dude.

12:28.881 --> 12:32.476
Stump, that's her son.
He's, like, four years old.

12:32.551 --> 12:35.179
That is so fucked up.

12:35.254 --> 12:38.018
<i>One good thing
about being dead-</i>

12:38.090 --> 12:40.024
Wouldn't have to listen
to all your bullshit.

12:40.092 --> 12:43.858
- Oh.
- That's all there is out here.
Just a bunch of bullshit.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.863
This bullshit's
got a crazy past.

12:45.931 --> 12:48.957
You guys know they used to use this
as a test ground for A-bombs?

12:49.034 --> 12:52.060
<i>You guys know
this used to be a test ground for A-bombs?</i>

12:52.137 --> 12:55.265
<i>- Who the fuck asked you, peace-ass shit boy?
- Oh, right.</i>

12:55.341 --> 12:58.435
I'm sorry. I forgot I was
dealing with Rambo resurrected.

12:58.510 --> 13:01.707
You Rambo resurrect my balls, bitch.

13:01.780 --> 13:06.444
You with the-

13:06.518 --> 13:09.078
<i>- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Come on, Crank!</i>

13:09.154 --> 13:11.622
<i>- You wanna die young, cabr√≥n?
- You guys, stop!</i>

13:11.690 --> 13:14.215
- I'll kill you right now!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Crank!

13:19.698 --> 13:22.258
I killed somebody once.

13:22.334 --> 13:25.735
It was easy.
That's why it's so dangerous.

13:32.177 --> 13:34.111
I don't fuckin'
like that guy.

13:34.179 --> 13:37.376
Well, I don't like bein' out here havin'
to put up with you, but I deal with it.

13:37.449 --> 13:40.316
<i>So deal with it.</i>

13:46.291 --> 13:48.486
<i>- Thanks.
- Don't mind Crank.</i>

13:48.560 --> 13:51.222
He's just
a cranky motherfucker.

14:36.175 --> 14:40.669
<i>- They're so top secret, they're invisible, huh?
- You got that right.</i>

14:47.186 --> 14:49.120
Hello!

15:00.365 --> 15:02.856
- Oh, leg's asleep.
- Dick's asleep.

15:02.935 --> 15:05.529
- You wanna wake it up?
- Nah, that's your daddy's job.

15:05.604 --> 15:07.538
Hey, you two, cut the bullshit.

15:07.606 --> 15:10.700
Off-load that crate.
Put it in the tent. Spitter, get me base.

15:10.776 --> 15:14.177
National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner
calling Yuma Flats Base. Over.

15:15.647 --> 15:18.878
<i>National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner
calling Yuma Flats Base.</i>

15:18.951 --> 15:20.748
Over.

15:20.819 --> 15:23.879
<i>- Nothing, sir. It's the hills.
- Keep trying.</i>

15:29.495 --> 15:33.864
<i>National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner
to Yuma Flats Base. Over.</i>

15:35.834 --> 15:39.270
Hello?

15:40.506 --> 15:42.872
- Private Crackhead.
- Sarge?

15:42.941 --> 15:46.035
See if you can find Colonel Redding.
He's supposed to be the security over here.

15:46.111 --> 15:51.743
See these cables? They run into that old bunker
over there. Check it out. Watch your step.

15:51.817 --> 15:54.115
- Yes, sir, Sergeant.
- Private Mickey Mouse.

15:54.186 --> 15:57.986
See if you can find some gas. There's gotta
be some cans around here somewhere.

15:58.056 --> 16:00.183
Yes, Sergeant.

16:03.795 --> 16:07.060
Napoleon,
where the fuck are you goin'?

16:07.132 --> 16:09.600
- I was just gonna use the facility.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

16:09.668 --> 16:13.399
You are in mountain assault training.
There are no port-a-potties in Kandahar.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.703
You will take your dumps
behind the cactus with the scorpions.

16:16.775 --> 16:19.266
- Do you understand me?
- What do I use for T.P., sir?

16:19.344 --> 16:22.142
Use your fuckin' hand.

16:22.214 --> 16:24.148
Yes, Sarge.

17:06.325 --> 17:08.292
<i>Yo!</i>

17:10.628 --> 17:13.826
Colonel Redding?

17:18.737 --> 17:20.728
Stupid bats!

17:24.343 --> 17:27.107
No gas, sir,
but I found this.

17:27.179 --> 17:30.979
Satellite phone.
Must've been how they contacted base.

17:31.049 --> 17:34.314
<i>- I don't think it's working.
- Man, somebody's got a temper.</i>

17:34.386 --> 17:38.049
Mine's all buttoned up, Sarge.
Nobody's home.

17:38.123 --> 17:40.648
Whose radio's that?

17:40.726 --> 17:45.129
<i>- Must be one of theirs.
- Wilson? Han? You there?</i>

17:49.801 --> 17:53.168
- Hello?
- Who the fuck is this?

17:53.238 --> 17:55.672
This is Sergeant Jeffrey Millstone
of the U.S. National Guard.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.800
<i>Who is this,
and what's your position?</i>

17:57.876 --> 18:00.470
<i>I need help.</i>

18:02.381 --> 18:04.406
<i>I'm up the hill.</i>

18:04.483 --> 18:07.145
<i>Are you in distress?</i>

18:07.219 --> 18:10.188
Fuck! Spitter, what's
the range on these things?

18:10.255 --> 18:12.223
Couple miles.
Line of sight.

18:12.291 --> 18:15.818
- Sarge.
- Looks like a signal mirror.

18:15.894 --> 18:18.863
<i>It's gotta be him.</i>

18:18.930 --> 18:22.331
- We're on a search and rescue mission.
- That's right, we are!

18:22.401 --> 18:24.335
Shut the fuck up!

18:24.403 --> 18:27.736
I said search and rescue,
not fuckin' spring break.

18:27.806 --> 18:31.742
I want you back here with weapons
and gear for a climbing assault in five.

18:31.810 --> 18:35.371
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir, Sarge.

18:35.447 --> 18:38.280
No disrespect, but do you
really think it's a good idea...

18:38.350 --> 18:40.284
goin' up there without
contacting headquarters?

18:40.352 --> 18:43.617
Do you like
fucking with me, Napoleon?

18:43.689 --> 18:45.589
I think you do.
You know what?

18:45.657 --> 18:48.353
You're officially in charge
of guarding the latrine.

18:48.427 --> 18:50.292
Not using it,
but guarding it.

18:50.362 --> 18:53.388
I want you to stand on one leg
and hold your rifle over your fucking head...

18:53.465 --> 18:57.060
and make sure that no one
steals or molests that port-a-potty...

18:57.135 --> 19:00.161
or I will have your Gomer Pyle ass
court-martialed immediately.

19:00.238 --> 19:03.036
Do you understand what I'm saying
to you? Do you understand me?

19:03.108 --> 19:05.338
Yeah, I'll go.
I just think that it's a bad idea.

19:05.410 --> 19:08.379
- Get over there and guard
that fuckin' latrine, now!
- Sir, yes, sir!

19:10.816 --> 19:14.149
- Live ammo or blanks?
- One live mag each weapon. It's heavier.

19:14.219 --> 19:18.747
Flashlights and hydration packs too.
The more weight, the better for you clowns.

19:18.824 --> 19:22.419
<i>You're halfway through your training,
and you look like a bunch of raw recruits.</i>

19:22.494 --> 19:26.430
<i>You're a disgrace to the U.S. National Guard,
and you wouldn't last five minutes in combat.</i>

19:26.498 --> 19:29.831
One leg, Gomer Pyle!

19:29.901 --> 19:32.165
<i>The rest of you,
get your asses up that hill.</i>

19:32.237 --> 19:36.571
<i>And wipe those silly smiles
off your faces now!</i>

19:41.146 --> 19:43.671
Let's move!
One leg, Pyle!

19:43.749 --> 19:46.843
<i>One leg!</i>

19:49.087 --> 19:51.351
- You're so bad.
- Company, halt! Johnson!

19:51.423 --> 19:54.449
- Sir?
- You stay here.

19:54.526 --> 19:57.962
<i>Spitter's coming with us. Get on
the main radio and try to raise somebody.</i>

19:58.029 --> 20:01.260
If you can get through to a medevac,
the guy'll have a hell of a better chance.

20:01.333 --> 20:04.769
- Now, move.
- Yes, Sarge.

20:04.836 --> 20:06.770
Don't forget to write.

20:06.838 --> 20:12.208
Get goin'! Turn around!
One leg!

20:34.266 --> 20:36.200
<i>One leg, Gomer Pyle!</i>

20:38.603 --> 20:41.436
<i>Mayday. Mayday. This is
the National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner...</i>

20:41.506 --> 20:43.974
calling the Yuma Flats Base
requesting a medevac.

20:44.042 --> 20:46.306
Over.

20:46.378 --> 20:50.712
Hello?

20:53.151 --> 20:55.745
<i>Shit.</i>

20:59.558 --> 21:02.425
Mayday. Mayday. This is
the National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner...

21:02.494 --> 21:04.962
calling the Yuma Flats Base
requesting a medevac.

21:05.030 --> 21:06.895
Over.

21:06.965 --> 21:09.559
What the hell are scientists
doing way the hell out here?

21:09.634 --> 21:11.568
There's nothing but
rocks and rattlesnakes.

21:11.636 --> 21:14.605
Army business, dumb ass,
and definitely none of your business.

21:14.673 --> 21:16.834
But, Sarge,
I am in the army.

21:16.908 --> 21:19.502
Which gives you the right
to shut the fuck up!

21:19.578 --> 21:21.910
Okay. I'll just
shut the fuck up then.

21:21.980 --> 21:23.914
How many people
are supposed to be here?

21:23.982 --> 21:26.712
I have no idea.
Maybe we can ask him up there.

21:26.785 --> 21:29.185
<i>What are we supposed
to do when we find this dude?</i>

21:29.254 --> 21:31.188
Well, it depends
on how bad he is.

21:31.256 --> 21:33.690
We wait for a medevac,
or we'll hump him down by hand.

21:33.758 --> 21:37.524
I know I'm not supposed to talk,
Sarge, but I hope-

21:37.596 --> 21:40.429
<i>Shit, man!</i>

21:42.467 --> 21:44.697
Come on, pull!
I got you, Mickey!

21:47.339 --> 21:50.536
<i>Hello?</i>

21:50.609 --> 21:52.543
<i>- Shit.
- You saved my life, Sarge.</i>

21:52.611 --> 21:55.341
Yeah, well, nobody's perfect.

21:55.413 --> 21:57.347
<i>How far down does that thing go?</i>

21:57.415 --> 22:00.009
<i>China?</i>

22:03.855 --> 22:06.380
Could be a hundred feet deep
or a hundred years old.

22:06.458 --> 22:09.222
Just waitin' to suck
your ass in.

22:09.294 --> 22:13.060
So keep your eyes open.
There's a lot of old mines around here.

22:13.131 --> 22:15.895
- How's your ankle, Mickey?
- I'm fine, I'm fine. Let's go.

22:19.337 --> 22:22.397
- We cannot afford to slow down.
- Come on, Sarge. Let's go.

22:22.474 --> 22:26.240
- Ow!
- Head back to base camp.

22:26.311 --> 22:29.439
- Oh, come on, Sarge.
- Mick, back to camp.

22:29.514 --> 22:32.950
Now.
That's an order.

22:36.988 --> 22:40.583
What the fuck is everybody
lookin' at? Let's keep movin'!

22:51.870 --> 22:54.839
Screw it.

23:00.145 --> 23:04.275
- Hey! You're not supposed to do that.
- Duty calls.

23:06.952 --> 23:09.512
Mayday. Mayday. This is
the National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner...

23:09.588 --> 23:11.920
<i>calling the Yuma Flats Base
requesting a medevac.</i>

23:11.990 --> 23:14.925
Over.

23:14.993 --> 23:17.484
<i>Mayday. Mayday.</i>

23:17.562 --> 23:20.963
<i>This is the National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner
calling the Yuma Flats Base-</i>

23:50.028 --> 23:52.223
- Oh, fuck! Fuck!
- What?

23:52.297 --> 23:55.289
- There's a hand in the shitter!
- What?

23:55.367 --> 23:59.827
Check it out!
Oh, fuckin'-

24:05.043 --> 24:08.740
Oh!

24:08.813 --> 24:11.145
There's nobody in there.

24:11.216 --> 24:13.810
Down... there.

24:30.735 --> 24:34.569
- Who was that guy?
- Shit-Man the Barbarian! I have no idea!

24:34.639 --> 24:36.834
Help me!

24:40.111 --> 24:43.740
<i>- Oh, man.
- Oh, God!</i>

24:47.018 --> 24:49.418
<i>I can't tell one rock from another.</i>

24:49.487 --> 24:53.617
It was between those three.

24:53.692 --> 24:58.391
Seems like that's
the only way up right there.

24:58.463 --> 25:00.454
- That ain't so bad.
- Nah, man.

25:00.532 --> 25:02.625
Not so bad at all...

25:02.701 --> 25:04.601
if you're
a fuckin' squirrel.

25:15.513 --> 25:19.210
- What's with all these cuts?
- I don't know.

25:28.493 --> 25:30.427
Who did this to you?

25:32.464 --> 25:35.592
They're... here.

25:38.570 --> 25:40.470
Who's they?

25:49.547 --> 25:52.175
None of the cuts
were that deep.

25:52.250 --> 25:55.583
- Massive infection.
- What?

25:55.653 --> 25:59.453
Shit stinks because it's full of pathogens.

25:59.524 --> 26:03.517
Whoever did this to him
wanted him to die slowly.

26:03.595 --> 26:05.688
What kind of person
could do that to someone?

26:05.764 --> 26:08.426
I honestly don't know.

26:12.704 --> 26:14.934
Let's go, Delmar.

26:18.042 --> 26:20.033
<i>There you go.</i>

26:23.848 --> 26:25.839
<i>Pick your spots.</i>

26:28.253 --> 26:30.687
Find the creases.

26:33.124 --> 26:35.115
<i>You got it.
You got it!</i>

26:40.198 --> 26:43.099
<i>- Ow!
- Keep goin', soldier.</i>

26:45.236 --> 26:48.637
There you go. That's what
I'm talkin' about, Delmar.

26:48.706 --> 26:52.073
<i>- Whoo! Nice!
- All right. All right!</i>

26:55.880 --> 26:59.646
<i>- All right!
- Yeah! Spider-Man!</i>

26:59.717 --> 27:01.981
You are officially
a bad motherfucker.

27:02.053 --> 27:06.513
<i>Stump, you're up next.
The rest of you, get your asses ready.</i>

27:21.940 --> 27:24.738
Love you, Mommy.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.187
<i>Take your time and pick your spots, Stump.</i>

27:40.825 --> 27:42.554
Asshole!

27:42.627 --> 27:45.596
Oh, easy.
Sarge says we're moving out.

27:45.663 --> 27:47.597
Well, make some noise
next time you come up behind me!

27:47.665 --> 27:51.533
Yeah, whatever.
Look, I'm just the messenger.

27:52.904 --> 27:55.429
<i>Chicks, man.</i>

28:04.349 --> 28:06.283
Hello? Hello?

28:06.351 --> 28:10.811
<i>Over. Hello?
Hello? Over.</i>

28:12.991 --> 28:16.791
<i>- Hello? Hello? Over.
- You get through to 'em?</i>

28:16.861 --> 28:20.058
This radio sucks!

28:23.601 --> 28:26.263
Hello? Sarge?
Anybody?

28:31.209 --> 28:33.609
Holy shit!

28:33.678 --> 28:36.272
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no, no, no!

28:36.347 --> 28:39.839
- No!
- Oh, my God!

28:42.387 --> 28:45.288
- Shit!
- What are you doin'?

28:46.391 --> 28:48.325
- Fuck!
- What?

28:48.393 --> 28:51.089
Where's your rifle?

28:53.164 --> 28:55.359
<i>Oh, God, it's gone!</i>

28:56.367 --> 28:58.995
Oh, God!

29:02.273 --> 29:05.367
- Let's just get up there.
- No, no, no, no, no. We're not goin' up that hill.

29:05.443 --> 29:08.003
I'm not hiding down here
waiting for them to come down!

29:08.079 --> 29:10.445
What? You scared?

29:10.515 --> 29:15.111
It's not about being scared. It's about not
making idiotic and possibly fatal decisions.

29:15.186 --> 29:17.620
Right. I forgot
who I was speaking to.

29:17.689 --> 29:20.783
The same genius
who got his whole squad blown to hell.

29:20.858 --> 29:26.194
Didn't you hear what he said?
Someone is here. You wanna die like him?

29:27.765 --> 29:30.529
Let's just get up
with the others.

29:33.838 --> 29:37.569
Hello, Sarge?
Hello, Sarge?

29:43.081 --> 29:45.879
<i>Hello? Sarge?
Anyone?</i>

29:45.950 --> 29:49.750
Can anybody out there read me?

30:25.690 --> 30:30.627
Napoleon!

30:30.695 --> 30:34.722
- What?
- I don't know-

30:34.799 --> 30:39.736
Amber!

30:39.804 --> 30:43.296
Hey!

30:48.479 --> 30:51.312
Hey!

30:54.786 --> 30:58.950
Napoleon!

31:07.965 --> 31:10.661
Did I hit him?

31:13.037 --> 31:17.667
Mickey! Mickey!

31:17.742 --> 31:23.009
- Hey, who was that?
- Mickey, something's going on!
Oh, God. Are you all right?

31:23.081 --> 31:26.573
Yeah, I just twisted my ankle-

31:26.651 --> 31:29.017
Hold on!

31:29.087 --> 31:33.251
Holy shit! Fuck!

31:33.324 --> 31:36.589
Hold on! Hold on!
I got you!

31:36.661 --> 31:38.652
Oh, shit! Oh, God!

31:38.729 --> 31:40.663
- Shit!
- Hold on! I got you!

31:40.731 --> 31:44.326
Shoot the fucker! Shoot him!

31:44.402 --> 31:47.530
<i>- Shoot him!
- I can't see in there!</i>

31:49.574 --> 31:53.101
I don't have a shot!

31:53.177 --> 31:55.873
Fucking help me, man!

32:01.686 --> 32:04.018
<i>Don't let go! Mickey!</i>

32:06.257 --> 32:08.521
Oh, God!
Oh!

32:11.529 --> 32:13.690
Mickey!

32:18.636 --> 32:22.163
<i>- Oh, God!
- Mickey!</i>

32:24.075 --> 32:26.168
Man, this is some bullshit.

32:35.620 --> 32:38.714
- What?
- Thought I heard something.

32:38.789 --> 32:41.223
<i>- A shot.
- This is a military base.</i>

32:41.292 --> 32:43.817
People are shootin'
all over the place.

32:43.895 --> 32:47.888
I think it came from camp. Has anybody
checked in with Amber recently?

32:47.965 --> 32:51.093
Mickey's down there by now.
You know he's got her in a tent...

32:51.169 --> 32:53.467
and they're doin'
a whole nother kind of training.

32:53.538 --> 32:55.563
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

32:55.640 --> 32:57.733
<i>- Sarge, up there!
- I see it!</i>

32:57.808 --> 33:01.869
- Another one.
- You two, get your asses up here!

33:01.946 --> 33:04.039
Come on.

33:04.115 --> 33:06.606
<i>Hello!</i>

33:08.619 --> 33:11.816
Hello!

33:18.462 --> 33:20.396
Oh, no.

33:23.801 --> 33:26.702
The red and black high-top forces.
What?

33:26.771 --> 33:30.969
- And it's my size too?
- What the fuck's it doing way up here?

33:31.042 --> 33:33.636
Now, if we could only find
the other ones, we'd be in business.

33:33.711 --> 33:36.737
<i>Sarge, over here!</i>

33:38.683 --> 33:40.981
<i>Sarge!</i>

33:48.659 --> 33:52.117
<i>What the fuck is in his head?</i>

33:53.664 --> 33:55.928
<i>- Private Crackhead, fish it out.
- Huh?</i>

33:56.000 --> 33:57.627
<i>Shit.</i>

34:07.511 --> 34:10.969
"Dr. Paul Foster.
Department of Defense."

34:11.047 --> 34:14.984
Looks like we found
one of our scientists.

34:16.721 --> 34:19.188
- Lock and load.
- This isn't supposed to happen
on an army base, man.

34:19.257 --> 34:21.953
<i>- In the middle of a U.S. military facility.
- The size of Rhode Island.</i>

34:22.025 --> 34:25.484
Look, if some asshole wants to go nuts,
this is a damn good place to do it.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.827
<i>Spitter, get Amber on the radio.</i>

34:29.900 --> 34:32.994
Stark Nine. Stark Nine. Amber,
this is Spitter. You read me? Over.

34:35.106 --> 34:39.600
Stark Nine. Stark Nine.
Amber, this is Spitter. You read me? Over.

34:43.581 --> 34:45.775
There's too much interference.

34:45.850 --> 34:50.184
<i>- Sarge, we should go back down-
- Amber's fine. She's got Mick and Napoleon.</i>

34:50.254 --> 34:52.245
<i>- Help me.
- That their radio?</i>

34:52.322 --> 34:56.020
Let me have it.
Colonel Redding, is this you?

34:59.964 --> 35:01.693
Hello?
Can you hear me?

35:04.969 --> 35:08.405
<i>That wasn't
the same voice as before.</i>

35:08.472 --> 35:11.839
<i>Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't.
But if somebody's hurt, we're gonna help him.</i>

35:11.909 --> 35:14.309
<i>And if somebody is fucking with us,
we're gonna find out who it is.</i>

35:14.378 --> 35:17.370
- Sarge-
- I told you before, this isn't spring break.

35:17.448 --> 35:20.212
One way or the other,
lives are at stake.

35:20.284 --> 35:23.412
That's how it is.

35:23.487 --> 35:25.421
<i>Crank, Spitter,
you stay with me on lead.</i>

35:25.489 --> 35:28.856
Missy, Stump, Delmar,
you bring up the rear. Watch our backs.

35:28.926 --> 35:32.589
Stay alert and stay alive.
Let's move.

36:23.981 --> 36:26.472
You hear somethin'?

36:26.550 --> 36:29.576
I don't know.
Maybe a bird?

36:29.653 --> 36:32.121
- Keep your eyes open.
- Okay.

36:42.900 --> 36:44.925
What the fuck was that?

36:47.972 --> 36:49.906
Aw, shit!

36:49.974 --> 36:53.410
- What the fuck-
- No!

36:53.477 --> 36:56.503
<i>Sarge!</i>

36:56.580 --> 37:00.516
- Spitter! Fuck!
- Oh, fuck, man! Sarge!

37:00.584 --> 37:03.280
That was Spit, man.

37:03.354 --> 37:05.322
<i>Sarge!</i>

37:05.389 --> 37:07.357
<i>- Sarge!
- I didn't mean to do that!</i>

37:07.425 --> 37:10.087
<i>Sarge!</i>

37:12.396 --> 37:14.762
You hurt? You hurt?

37:14.832 --> 37:16.800
- I didn't mean to do that.
- Do what?

37:16.867 --> 37:19.961
Sarge!
Sarge! Sarge!

37:20.037 --> 37:22.005
Sarge!

37:22.072 --> 37:24.632
- What do we do?
- Go get me the medi-pack.

37:24.708 --> 37:28.474
Medi-pack? D!
Medi-pack! Bring it over here!

37:36.120 --> 37:38.486
Fuck, man! Fuck.

37:40.391 --> 37:42.825
- What happened?
- I swear, man, this dude
just popped out of nowhere.

37:42.893 --> 37:45.054
<i>- He stabbed Spit in the back.
- Hey, man.</i>

37:45.129 --> 37:47.154
<i>I didn't mean to.
Fuck, man.</i>

37:47.231 --> 37:50.223
<i>- Is he okay? Is he okay?
- Sarge?</i>

37:52.703 --> 37:54.466
Sarge?
Come on, breathe.

37:54.538 --> 37:57.735
Breathe, Sarge.

37:57.808 --> 38:00.003
Sarge, stay with us.

38:00.077 --> 38:02.011
<i>- Sarge!
- What do we need?</i>

38:02.079 --> 38:04.013
What do you need?

38:04.081 --> 38:06.174
<i>Crank!</i>

38:06.250 --> 38:08.184
Missy,
what do you need?

38:08.252 --> 38:11.346
<i>Crank! Crank!
Tell them, man! Tell them!</i>

38:11.422 --> 38:14.721
<i>It was an accident.
It was a fucking accident.</i>

38:16.961 --> 38:21.591
They're fucking with us.
These guys are smart.

38:29.974 --> 38:33.569
<i>Amber?
Where's Mickey?</i>

38:55.499 --> 38:58.798
Watch between the rocks.
Under your feet too.

38:58.869 --> 39:01.599
- That's how they got Mickey?
- That's how they did it.

39:01.672 --> 39:03.663
God.

39:08.178 --> 39:10.510
What is it?

39:12.116 --> 39:14.710
<i>What do you see, Delmar?</i>

39:14.785 --> 39:17.879
It's nothin'.
We're almost there.

39:30.901 --> 39:34.166
All right, guys.
Let's rig a line and get Sarge down.

39:34.238 --> 39:38.436
- I'm going down with him.
- Sorry, Spit. I don't know how
to rig for a two-man.

39:38.509 --> 39:40.443
<i>- Yeah, me either, man.
- I can do it.</i>

39:42.846 --> 39:46.509
All right. All right.
Let's make it happen.

39:51.655 --> 39:54.123
- You need two, right?
- Yeah.

39:54.191 --> 39:56.921
<i>Oh, and a couple
of those carabiners.</i>

40:00.164 --> 40:02.291
<i>Prop him up.</i>

40:02.366 --> 40:04.766
Yo, prop him up.

40:04.835 --> 40:07.804
- You sure you know what you're doing?
- Double bowline.

40:07.871 --> 40:09.862
<i>- Right knot for the job.
- You sure about that?</i>

40:09.940 --> 40:14.001
- I was an Eagle Scout.
- It better fuckin' hold.

40:14.078 --> 40:16.273
Come on, Spit.
Let's do it.

40:24.288 --> 40:28.315
You ready?
All right.

40:32.630 --> 40:35.292
I'm sorry, Spitter.
It's the only way.

40:35.366 --> 40:38.995
If he's loose, he'll fall out of his harness.
Okay?

40:39.069 --> 40:41.003
Mm-hmm.

40:41.071 --> 40:43.835
Okay.

40:43.907 --> 40:48.071
<i>- See you down there, cabr√≥n.
- Okay, man.</i>

40:48.145 --> 40:50.875
Okay?

40:50.948 --> 40:53.746
Easy. Easy.

40:53.817 --> 40:56.752
<i>Okay.</i>

40:56.820 --> 40:59.015
<i>You got it, Spitter.</i>

40:59.089 --> 41:01.023
All right, man.
Plant your feet.

41:01.091 --> 41:03.150
Take it easy.

41:03.227 --> 41:05.320
<i>Right there, Spitter.
You got it. Plant your feet, man.</i>

41:05.396 --> 41:07.455
<i>- You're doin' good, Spitter.
- Little more. Little more.</i>

41:07.531 --> 41:09.021
Right there.

41:09.099 --> 41:12.068
<i>Napoleon, get your thumb
out of your ass and help us out!</i>

41:12.136 --> 41:14.001
<i>- You comfortable?
- Yeah.</i>

41:14.071 --> 41:17.199
<i>You're looking good, man.
Keep it right there.</i>

41:17.274 --> 41:19.401
<i>- All right, slow down. I'm about to lose visual.
- Slow down a little.</i>

41:19.476 --> 41:22.775
<i>Keep it slow, Spitter.</i>

41:22.846 --> 41:24.780
<i>Yo, slow down.
Slow down.</i>

41:27.317 --> 41:29.751
<i>Spitter! Spitter! Spit-</i>

41:29.820 --> 41:33.551
- Spitter!
- What happened?

41:33.624 --> 41:36.092
<i>What- What happened?</i>

41:36.160 --> 41:38.958
<i>- What happened?
- He's fuckin' dead, man.</i>

41:39.029 --> 41:42.089
<i>- What the fuck happened?
- He's fuckin' dead.</i>

41:47.938 --> 41:52.034
Your fuckin' knot didn't hold,
you lying faggot!

41:52.109 --> 41:54.873
<i>- The rope must've broke.
- The rope didn't break.</i>

41:54.945 --> 41:56.879
<i>- Exactly.
- It was cut.</i>

41:59.850 --> 42:03.946
Oh, man, we're gettin' picked off
one by one here.

42:04.021 --> 42:05.716
You motherfuckers!

42:05.789 --> 42:08.758
You motherfuckers are dead!

42:08.826 --> 42:10.987
<i>You hear me?</i>

42:11.061 --> 42:14.258
Dead!

42:14.331 --> 42:16.299
Aw, shit!

42:16.366 --> 42:18.459
Where are the ropes?

42:18.535 --> 42:22.437
<i>- Hey, who's got the rest of the ropes?
- I put 'em up there.</i>

42:22.506 --> 42:25.339
They're gone.
They're not here.

42:25.409 --> 42:28.071
We can't get down
without the ropes.

42:28.145 --> 42:31.672
<i>Who the hell is doing all of
this fuckin' bullshit to us?</i>

42:31.749 --> 42:34.912
<i>Whoever these fuckers are,
they want us dead.</i>

42:34.985 --> 42:38.819
<i>No, that's where they want us-
thinkin' we got no chance.</i>

42:38.889 --> 42:41.653
We're gonna get out
of this together.

42:41.725 --> 42:43.784
Let's think about that.

42:43.861 --> 42:45.692
<i>- How do we get down?
- There's gotta be a way.</i>

42:45.763 --> 42:48.163
They got up here.
We'll take the same way down.

42:59.843 --> 43:02.641
<i>Watch your step. It's a long way down.</i>

43:09.787 --> 43:11.778
Damn!

43:28.639 --> 43:30.800
<i>You're not gonna like this.</i>

43:30.874 --> 43:33.707
What?

43:33.777 --> 43:36.302
Oh, fuck, man!

43:36.380 --> 43:39.042
Another dead end!

43:39.116 --> 43:42.017
No way we're gettin' down
without ropes. I told you!

43:42.085 --> 43:44.019
We go back and find another way.

43:46.690 --> 43:48.624
Oh, shit!

43:48.692 --> 43:51.024
D., why the fuck are we
moving towards the weird noises?

43:51.094 --> 43:53.028
<i>- Just shut the hell up!
- You shut the hell up!</i>

43:53.096 --> 43:55.087
<i>This is bullshit!</i>

43:57.968 --> 44:00.937
- D...!
- Shh!

44:04.641 --> 44:06.575
Holy shit.

44:09.479 --> 44:12.880
- Go ahead and shoot.
- Let's get some first aid.

44:12.950 --> 44:15.043
- Coming up.
- Napoleon, watch our backs.

44:15.118 --> 44:18.178
<i>- Got it.
- Colonel Redding.</i>

44:18.255 --> 44:21.088
Just hang on, sir, okay?
We're gonna get you out of here.

44:21.158 --> 44:24.719
Where's your C.O.?
Where's your commanding officer?

44:24.795 --> 44:27.229
We lost him.

44:27.297 --> 44:31.097
- Better let me see those wounds, sir.
- You don't have a fucking clue!

44:34.671 --> 44:37.401
Shit!

44:39.776 --> 44:43.803
Sir, if you know something
we should know, now's the time.

44:43.881 --> 44:48.443
<i>I just needed a little proof.</i>

44:48.518 --> 44:50.782
- Proof of what?
- What's going on here, Colonel?

44:50.854 --> 44:54.381
It's not the fucks
in caves...

44:54.458 --> 44:57.427
halfway around the world
that keep me up at night.

44:57.494 --> 44:59.155
<i>Mm-mmm.</i>

44:59.229 --> 45:03.290
They're right here in the middle
of our own goddamn base.

45:03.367 --> 45:05.494
<i>People still living
in the mines.</i>

45:05.569 --> 45:08.834
<i>They thought they got rid of them,
but I knew they didn't.</i>

45:08.906 --> 45:12.103
- You knew about these fuckers?
- One or two more nights...

45:12.175 --> 45:16.134
I-I-I-I could've had 'em
blown back to the Stone Age.

45:16.213 --> 45:20.081
Tell us what to do, Colonel.
How do we get out of here?

45:20.150 --> 45:22.084
<i>That's a good fuckin' question, isn't it?</i>

45:22.152 --> 45:26.350
You could-You could
go down through the mines...

45:26.423 --> 45:29.256
<i>except they'd kill you
for sure.</i>

45:29.326 --> 45:31.794
All except the girls.

45:31.862 --> 45:35.025
You ladies, they'll keep you alive
for breeding...

45:35.098 --> 45:37.532
<i>and trying to get
their numbers back up.</i>

45:37.601 --> 45:39.535
What?

45:39.603 --> 45:43.699
Yeah, whatever, asshole.
How do we get down this hill?

45:43.774 --> 45:47.335
Simple.

45:53.684 --> 45:56.710
What the fuck?
What the fuck was that, man?

46:32.889 --> 46:35.551
I don't know how much more
of this I can take.

46:37.894 --> 46:41.421
- I'm so fucking scared.
- We're gonna get through this.

46:41.498 --> 46:43.489
<i>We're gonna make it
out of here, okay?</i>

46:43.567 --> 46:45.535
You think?

46:45.602 --> 46:49.561
Have to.
I'm the only real family Clyde's got.

46:49.639 --> 46:52.233
Give anything just to
smell his hair again.

46:53.810 --> 46:55.744
You never talk about him.

46:57.414 --> 47:01.851
Work's work. Family is-
I don't know- sacred.

47:01.918 --> 47:04.045
I always tried
keeping the two separate.

47:06.390 --> 47:08.790
I guess that's all bullshit now.

47:16.166 --> 47:18.726
He's beautiful.

47:18.802 --> 47:21.293
Now!

47:29.479 --> 47:31.811
<i>Yeah!</i>

47:31.882 --> 47:34.749
<i>Biatch!</i>

47:37.721 --> 47:40.315
<i>Is he dead?</i>

47:40.390 --> 47:42.290
Fuckin'-A!

47:42.359 --> 47:44.884
Got him.

47:44.961 --> 47:48.089
- You all right?
- Mm-hmm.

47:48.165 --> 47:51.464
That's the piece of shit
that jumped me back at camp.

47:51.535 --> 47:54.595
<i>I think he killed Mickey too.</i>

47:59.109 --> 48:01.907
Damn.
He's fuckin' ugly.

48:01.978 --> 48:05.607
<i>- Fuckin' stinks.
- He's fucking big, man.</i>

48:05.682 --> 48:09.243
Still, nothing a little
hot lead can't fix.

48:09.319 --> 48:12.982
<i>Hot lead?
Listen to you, man.</i>

48:13.056 --> 48:15.957
Yeah, well, it's just one.
How many are left?

48:16.026 --> 48:17.994
Hey, bring 'em on, man.

48:19.763 --> 48:21.993
Hey.
You guys did good.

48:22.065 --> 48:24.329
- Thanks.
- Smells like shit.

48:24.401 --> 48:27.529
<i>Yeah! We got this.</i>

48:54.431 --> 48:56.695
Where's Missy?

48:56.766 --> 48:58.700
<i>Hey, Missy?</i>

48:58.768 --> 49:01.532
- Shit!
- It's Missy!

49:01.605 --> 49:03.800
There!

49:06.409 --> 49:08.240
Watch yourselves.

49:16.887 --> 49:19.720
<i>Missy!</i>

49:19.789 --> 49:22.553
Missy!

49:28.932 --> 49:32.390
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on.
Delmar, you heard what that dude said.

49:32.469 --> 49:34.403
We should climb down, man.

49:34.471 --> 49:37.599
<i>- What are you talkin' about?
- I'm talkin' about you and me.</i>

49:37.674 --> 49:41.440
We don't need ropes. We can
make it down freestyle no sweat, man.

49:41.511 --> 49:43.411
- Let's just do it.
- What about the rest of us?

49:43.480 --> 49:46.278
- What about Missy?
- We can get down fast, and you know it.

49:46.349 --> 49:49.750
The rest of you guys, just-just hang tough,
and we're gonna bring back some help.

49:49.819 --> 49:53.186
- Fuck that!
- We stick together. It's the best way.

49:53.256 --> 49:54.780
<i>- We separate-
- We're dead.</i>

49:54.858 --> 49:57.588
<i>You got that right.</i>

49:57.661 --> 50:02.291
- Stump.
- I'm gonna take my chances, man.

50:03.767 --> 50:07.965
<i>Stump. Stay with us, man. Come on.</i>

50:08.038 --> 50:12.031
- When I get down, I'm gonna bring back help.
- This is stupid, man!

50:12.108 --> 50:14.838
<i>Crank, that is
fuckin' stupid, man.</i>

50:17.948 --> 50:20.007
I'm gonna bring back help.

50:21.718 --> 50:23.811
Shit.

50:29.125 --> 50:32.117
You guys ready for this?

50:32.195 --> 50:34.254
We got your back.

50:55.085 --> 50:57.178
<i>It stinks in here.</i>

50:57.254 --> 51:00.746
<i>- You see anything?
- There's only
one way they could've gone.</i>

51:16.940 --> 51:21.104
Dead end?
Where the fuck are they?

51:24.748 --> 51:26.739
<i>Guys.</i>

51:35.859 --> 51:37.850
Down here.

51:52.909 --> 51:55.639
I can't see shit.

51:59.849 --> 52:03.182
I'll check it out.
Wait for my signal.

52:26.676 --> 52:29.167
<i>- You good?
- Clear!</i>

52:41.958 --> 52:43.949
Shit!

52:46.029 --> 52:48.623
Oh, God.

52:48.698 --> 52:53.067
Oh, my God!

52:55.705 --> 52:57.900
Get 'em off me!

52:57.974 --> 53:00.568
You're fine.
It's all right.

53:06.549 --> 53:09.416
Jesus Christ.

53:09.486 --> 53:11.750
<i>You cool, Napoleon?</i>

53:11.821 --> 53:15.951
Yeah, I think so.
Aw, Jesus!

53:16.025 --> 53:19.290
- Come on, Crank.
- Where the hell are we?

53:19.362 --> 53:21.353
Next level down.

53:28.738 --> 53:31.730
<i>All right. Okay.</i>

53:46.556 --> 53:49.992
Fuck!

53:54.197 --> 53:56.358
It's just fuckin' rocks.

53:56.433 --> 53:58.958
You're not gonna-

54:00.370 --> 54:03.464
I'm not gonna let
you bastards get me.

54:03.540 --> 54:07.499
Not me, not today.
It's not gonna happen.

54:12.449 --> 54:14.508
Hey, guys.

54:14.584 --> 54:16.575
There's a breeze.

54:30.366 --> 54:32.357
<i>Hey.</i>

54:41.744 --> 54:45.043
Shit.

54:50.420 --> 54:53.253
This is where the fuckers hid
to cut the ropes.

54:56.059 --> 54:57.993
We can't just leave them
down there.

54:58.061 --> 55:02.191
<i>There's nothing we can do for 'em now except
find Missy and get the fuck out of here.</i>

55:02.265 --> 55:04.699
Missy's probably
dead too.

55:04.767 --> 55:07.998
<i>You're not doing anybody
any good talking like that.</i>

55:59.022 --> 56:00.489
Come on.

56:11.668 --> 56:14.262
<i>Delmar!</i>

56:16.973 --> 56:19.305
Delmar.

56:41.764 --> 56:45.427
Help me! Oh, God!

56:45.501 --> 56:47.833
Oh, no!

56:57.246 --> 57:00.443
<i>Is it a dead end?</i>

57:00.516 --> 57:04.418
<i>No. No, it goes through.</i>

57:04.487 --> 57:07.081
- How deep is it?
- Let's see.

57:38.821 --> 57:41.119
How many do you think
there are?

57:41.190 --> 57:43.715
Who knows?
Too many.

57:47.397 --> 57:49.661
- What are you doing?
- Saving one for myself.

57:49.732 --> 57:52.064
Hey!

57:52.135 --> 57:54.069
Do you remember
what Crank said?

57:54.137 --> 57:56.264
"Dead is never better."

57:56.339 --> 57:58.364
We're gonna get
out of here.

58:00.343 --> 58:02.277
It's just-

58:02.345 --> 58:05.280
- Amber!
- Napoleon!

58:05.348 --> 58:08.078
Hang on! Shit!

58:10.486 --> 58:12.351
<i>Fuck!</i>

58:12.422 --> 58:15.789
- What the hell?
- Shit!

58:15.858 --> 58:17.985
Come on.

58:20.930 --> 58:24.024
<i>You guys all right?</i>

58:25.868 --> 58:27.859
Amber.

58:29.205 --> 58:31.139
<i>Napoleon!</i>

58:37.080 --> 58:40.982
Where's my rifle?

58:41.050 --> 58:43.041
You okay? Shit.

58:43.119 --> 58:45.053
<i>Amber!</i>

58:45.121 --> 58:46.748
You guys all right?

58:46.823 --> 58:49.485
Yeah. We're all right.

58:51.627 --> 58:53.561
We're gonna find
a way down.

58:53.629 --> 58:56.928
- No problem.
- Hang on.

58:56.999 --> 58:58.990
Shit!

59:10.580 --> 59:12.514
Napoleon.

59:16.352 --> 59:18.582
What are you doing?

59:31.400 --> 59:33.527
Napoleon.

59:38.474 --> 59:40.442
I thought I heard something.

59:49.585 --> 59:51.018
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

59:52.421 --> 59:54.821
I think that's the level
they're on.

59:54.891 --> 59:58.520
<i>- Do you think we could climb down without gear?
- See that beam?</i>

59:58.594 --> 01:00:00.960
<i>If we can make it across,
we slide down that.</i>

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:03.794
I think I can make
that jump.

01:00:03.866 --> 01:00:05.697
What are you doing?

01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:08.999
Crank? Crank? Wait!

01:00:09.071 --> 01:00:11.039
<i>- Crank!
- Fuck!</i>

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:15.009
Shit!

01:00:15.077 --> 01:00:18.410
Delmar, your arm!

01:00:18.481 --> 01:00:20.210
<i>Your arm!</i>

01:00:23.186 --> 01:00:24.881
Hang on!

01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:40.435
Thanks.

01:00:40.503 --> 01:00:42.869
Let's keep it moving.

01:01:14.904 --> 01:01:16.838
Let's go.

01:01:39.629 --> 01:01:42.393
Oh, God.

01:01:44.133 --> 01:01:45.998
Want.

01:01:49.171 --> 01:01:52.436
Mama.

01:01:52.508 --> 01:01:55.841
Pretty.

01:01:59.181 --> 01:02:01.775
Dirty cunt!

01:02:03.252 --> 01:02:05.345
- No!
- Come here.

01:02:06.188 --> 01:02:07.985
Mine!

01:02:15.531 --> 01:02:17.829
So sweet.

01:02:42.591 --> 01:02:46.118
No. Was her. Papa. No.

01:03:02.211 --> 01:03:04.236
- No.
- You give me baby.

01:03:07.984 --> 01:03:10.282
- Shit.
- Goddamn it. Come on.

01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:12.753
Motherfucker!

01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:18.293
<i>Missy!</i>

01:03:18.361 --> 01:03:21.023
<i>Help me!</i>

01:03:21.097 --> 01:03:23.998
<i>Somebody, help me!</i>

01:03:58.868 --> 01:04:01.928
Shit. It's Stump's headband.

01:04:02.004 --> 01:04:03.938
What?

01:04:07.943 --> 01:04:09.774
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:04:09.845 --> 01:04:12.211
Oh, shit.

01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:22.752
Where is he?

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:24.952
There!

01:04:27.997 --> 01:04:31.433
<i>There!</i>

01:04:45.347 --> 01:04:47.941
- Okay!
- Got you.

01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:07.160
Mine!

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:21.914
Enough!

01:05:30.192 --> 01:05:32.626
<i>Kill them all.</i>

01:05:34.063 --> 01:05:36.861
Napoleon.
We gotta go.

01:05:36.932 --> 01:05:39.526
He's got a gun.
Come on.

01:06:18.073 --> 01:06:19.802
Napoleon?

01:06:25.447 --> 01:06:28.382
The hatch. Get the hatch.
Get the hatch!

01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:30.247
Shh! Shh.

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:35.123
<i>Missy? Missy?</i>

01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:37.182
<i>Which way?</i>

01:06:38.961 --> 01:06:41.691
You safe here.

01:06:42.865 --> 01:06:44.890
<i>Safe.</i>

01:06:44.967 --> 01:06:47.902
<i>I'm right behind you. Let's go.</i>

01:06:50.072 --> 01:06:52.063
Goddamn.

01:07:00.849 --> 01:07:03.511
What the hell happened here?

01:07:14.997 --> 01:07:17.795
Come on, bitch!

01:07:22.471 --> 01:07:24.905
Yeah, baby!
It's all about volume!

01:07:24.974 --> 01:07:26.635
<i>- Gotta have volume!
- It's Crank.</i>

01:07:28.844 --> 01:07:31.438
- You okay?
- I'm all right. I'm all right.

01:07:31.513 --> 01:07:35.609
Lone Ranger shoulder wound.
Missed the bone completely.

01:07:35.684 --> 01:07:37.675
Damn.

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:43.584
- You good?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:07:46.128 --> 01:07:49.291
Who you fucking with, huh?
Who you fucking with?

01:07:49.365 --> 01:07:52.766
Crank? Crank?

01:07:52.835 --> 01:07:55.269
<i>You got any ammo left?</i>

01:07:59.308 --> 01:08:01.469
Fuck.

01:08:01.543 --> 01:08:03.704
<i>I'm out too.</i>

01:08:12.821 --> 01:08:15.119
Delmar. Your bayonet.

01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:22.160
- Crank. Delmar.
- Shit.

01:08:22.231 --> 01:08:24.221
Down here.

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:25.790
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:28.631
Oh, shit.
You guys are alive!

01:08:28.703 --> 01:08:33.470
What happened to you?
Delmar, are you all right?

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:36.636
- Be a hell of a lot better when we get out of here.
- Were you shot?

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:39.180
<i>- I'm fine. It's nothing.
- You sure?</i>

01:08:39.247 --> 01:08:41.876
- Hi.
- Shit!

01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:44.384
What the hell is that?

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:47.013
- He's okay.
- Are you out of your goddamn mind?
He's one of them.

01:08:47.089 --> 01:08:50.991
<i>- No, he just saved our lives.
- No fear. You come.</i>

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:53.493
<i>Follow me.</i>

01:08:57.566 --> 01:09:00.160
Come.

01:09:28.930 --> 01:09:30.921
<i>This way.</i>

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:38.504
- Whoa, whoa. You good?
- I'm all right.

01:09:38.573 --> 01:09:41.042
Don't worry.
I'm all right.

01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:43.270
We gotta get him outta here.

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:45.471
Missy's not that far.
You heard her screams.

01:09:45.546 --> 01:09:48.140
How are we gonna get her outta
here without any goddamn ammo?

01:09:48.216 --> 01:09:51.584
<i>- We can fight 'em with rocks and rifle butts if we have to.
- Who's Rambo resurrected now?</i>

01:09:51.653 --> 01:09:53.951
- I just wanna get everyone outta here.
- Yeah?

01:09:54.022 --> 01:09:57.321
- Well, tell that to Mickey and Spitter and Stump!
- Crank! Shut the hell up!

01:09:57.393 --> 01:10:00.920
- You trust that guy?
- He hid us from them. He didn't give us up.

01:10:00.996 --> 01:10:03.658
- We don't have any choice. We have to trust him.
- Bullshit!

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:06.963
<i>- God knows where he's taking us.
- To be honest with you...</i>

01:10:07.035 --> 01:10:11.233
I'm not sure God knows
anything about this place.

01:10:15.310 --> 01:10:17.437
Through here.

01:10:17.513 --> 01:10:20.141
Must through here.

01:10:39.168 --> 01:10:41.102
Jesus.

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:47.371
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

01:10:50.946 --> 01:10:54.677
<i>- Holy shit!
- Oh, man!</i>

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:57.947
Oh, God.

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:07.620
<i>- Geez!
- What the fuck!</i>

01:11:19.107 --> 01:11:20.734
Oh, man.

01:11:43.732 --> 01:11:45.632
Oh, my God!
It's Mickey!

01:11:45.701 --> 01:11:48.135
<i>- Don't look!
- Oh, God!</i>

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:55.035
<i>You sick fuck! You should be shot!</i>

01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:57.510
- I should kill you!
- Crank!

01:11:57.579 --> 01:12:01.709
What, man? Why you always trying
to shut me down, Delmar, huh?

01:12:01.783 --> 01:12:04.843
- Don't freak out. Don't freak out.
- What the fuck?

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:07.889
Don't freak out.
D-Don't freak out.

01:12:07.956 --> 01:12:11.016
<i>- Fuck, Delmar!
- What?</i>

01:12:11.093 --> 01:12:16.053
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait! Delmar.

01:12:16.131 --> 01:12:17.564
Delmar.

01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:22.332
Delmar.
What the fuck, man?

01:12:22.404 --> 01:12:24.269
You were hit twice?

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:32.513
Oh, fuck. Why didn't-
Why didn't you tell me?

01:12:32.581 --> 01:12:36.540
Don't do this, man.
Don't do this!

01:12:36.618 --> 01:12:40.714
Don't do this.
Don't leave me, man.

01:12:40.789 --> 01:12:43.155
Don't fucking leave me.

01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:48.289
Fuck!

01:12:48.363 --> 01:12:50.456
<i>Get me a medi-pack.
Napoleon!</i>

01:12:50.532 --> 01:12:54.229
Get me- Get me a medi-pack.
Come on.

01:12:54.303 --> 01:12:58.296
Crank.

01:12:58.373 --> 01:13:00.568
I'm not gonna leave him.

01:13:00.642 --> 01:13:03.736
I'm not gonna leave him here.
You sick fuck!

01:13:03.812 --> 01:13:07.145
- You're not gonna have him!
- Okay, okay.

01:13:07.215 --> 01:13:10.981
I'm gonna get you outta here.

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:13.078
Get us outta here.

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:20.885
Come.

01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:27.792
Come on.

01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:51.918
I'll get you outta here.

01:14:11.246 --> 01:14:13.840
<i>Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!</i>

01:14:13.915 --> 01:14:16.679
<i>I bet this leads outside!</i>

01:14:16.752 --> 01:14:18.982
Help me get this fuckin' door open.

01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:25.855
<i>- Come on!
- Hey, would you forget it, Crank?</i>

01:14:30.198 --> 01:14:33.429
Would you forget it? It's a blast door.
You're never gonna get it open.

01:14:33.502 --> 01:14:37.370
Fuck you!

01:14:39.775 --> 01:14:42.471
We need to get outta here,
you fucking retard!

01:14:42.544 --> 01:14:44.842
- Crank!
- How the fuck do we get outta here?

01:14:44.913 --> 01:14:48.144
- What about Missy?
- Would you get off this shit that she's alive?

01:14:48.216 --> 01:14:51.185
Missy is fucking dead!
Okay?

01:14:51.253 --> 01:14:53.483
Just like the rest of 'em.

01:14:53.555 --> 01:14:56.683
Just like we're gonna be if
we don't get the fuck outta here!

01:14:56.758 --> 01:14:59.921
<i>We are not leaving
this place without her.</i>

01:14:59.995 --> 01:15:01.895
You're stupid, okay?

01:15:03.999 --> 01:15:08.459
How the fuck do we get outta here, man?
Which way is it?

01:15:08.537 --> 01:15:11.404
What's over there?
What's over here?

01:15:11.473 --> 01:15:14.203
<i>- I'm going back for her!
- Amber, stay here.</i>

01:15:14.276 --> 01:15:15.903
- Guys!
- Amber?

01:15:15.977 --> 01:15:19.003
<i>Oh, shit. Guys!
Check it out!</i>

01:15:19.081 --> 01:15:21.845
Everything we need.

01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:24.681
Hey!

01:15:24.753 --> 01:15:27.688
Everything we fucking need!

01:15:27.756 --> 01:15:30.190
<i>No touch. No touch.</i>

01:15:30.258 --> 01:15:33.250
<i>- No touch. No touch!
- Amber.</i>

01:15:33.328 --> 01:15:35.558
Please, don't. Hey!

01:15:37.099 --> 01:15:40.466
- I'm begging you.
- I'd go back for you.

01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:44.505
Amber!

01:15:48.744 --> 01:15:51.474
Oh, yeah.

01:15:51.546 --> 01:15:54.140
Oh, yeah. Oh, shit.

01:16:01.656 --> 01:16:05.387
Oh, dynamite. Perfect.

01:16:09.931 --> 01:16:14.732
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna get
outta here after all.

01:16:18.006 --> 01:16:23.603
Oh, yeah. Oh, Delmar.
We're getting outta here, baby.

01:16:29.217 --> 01:16:31.242
What the-

01:16:35.423 --> 01:16:37.948
Fuck!

01:16:43.498 --> 01:16:46.399
<i>Oh, God. Crank!</i>

01:16:46.468 --> 01:16:50.097
- Oh, God. You okay?
- I'm all right.

01:16:50.172 --> 01:16:52.163
Crank!

01:16:55.177 --> 01:16:57.111
Crank?

01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:00.944
Crank!

01:17:10.826 --> 01:17:12.817
It's Missy.

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:14.339
Let's do it.

01:19:54.756 --> 01:19:57.657
- Missy's phone.
- What?

01:19:57.726 --> 01:20:00.251
Do you still have
Missy's phone?

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.395
Wait here.

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:20.343
<i>I can't take it anymore.
I don't wanna be quiet.</i>

01:20:20.415 --> 01:20:22.906
<i>I want to get out of here.</i>

01:20:22.984 --> 01:20:25.748
<i>We're gonna die.
Don't you get it? We're gonna die!</i>

01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:28.755
<i>Which way to go?</i>

01:20:28.823 --> 01:20:31.758
<i>Which way do we go,
Napoleon? Where?</i>

01:20:31.826 --> 01:20:34.795
<i>I can't take it anymore,
Napoleon. I can't!</i>

01:20:34.863 --> 01:20:38.060
<i>- I don't wanna be quiet.
- Genius.</i>

01:20:38.133 --> 01:20:41.034
<i>I want to get out of here. We're gonna die.
Don't you get it? We're gonna die!</i>

01:20:41.102 --> 01:20:44.833
- Jesus Christ.
- Amber.

01:20:44.906 --> 01:20:48.171
- You okay? Give me this arm. Stay with me.
- Amber, I wanna get out.

01:20:48.243 --> 01:20:51.337
<i>It's okay. We got you.
We got you.</i>

01:20:51.413 --> 01:20:54.405
<i>Where's everybody else?</i>

01:20:57.018 --> 01:20:59.145
<i>We're gonna die.</i>

01:21:09.497 --> 01:21:11.556
Love you, Mommy.

01:21:13.134 --> 01:21:16.695
Get me outta here, please!
Don't let him touch me again.

01:21:16.771 --> 01:21:20.207
- Come on. Let's go.
- Please.

01:21:20.275 --> 01:21:22.641
Don't let him touch me.
Amber.

01:21:22.710 --> 01:21:26.703
Come on! We got you!

01:21:28.383 --> 01:21:30.783
- Napoleon!
- I don't hear him anymore.

01:21:30.852 --> 01:21:33.878
What are you doing?

01:21:33.955 --> 01:21:36.617
Let's just get out of here.
