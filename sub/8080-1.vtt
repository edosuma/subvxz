01:04.807 --> 01:06.525
You're lucky, you know.

01:06.767 --> 01:09.884
I rarely allow anyone into my flat.

01:10.247 --> 01:13.603
I know, I know, I know.

01:13.847 --> 01:15.758
Humble digs.

01:16.007 --> 01:19.158
Not exactly what you'd call
a "panty peeler."

01:20.687 --> 01:22.439
Do you know what I mean?

01:24.407 --> 01:26.841
But it suits me just fine.

01:27.087 --> 01:30.636
To be honest, I rarely spend a night
in my own bed anyway.

01:32.287 --> 01:33.845
You see, here's my theory:

01:34.087 --> 01:36.999
For most women, if a guy's
a good provider

01:37.247 --> 01:41.445
and generally a nice chap, six-pack
abs really aren't a deal-breaker.

01:41.687 --> 01:43.200
On the flip side, however,

01:43.447 --> 01:45.517
even though the PC boyfriend
sat next to you

01:45.767 --> 01:48.235
with his arm slung around
your shoulder will deny it...

01:48.807 --> 01:53.517
And he will deny it. For us boys,
it's all about F.B.B.

01:56.807 --> 02:00.402
Face. Boobs. Bum.

02:00.647 --> 02:02.239
I'm just being honest.

02:02.767 --> 02:05.679
It's been said that clothes
speak the international language.

02:05.927 --> 02:09.078
And I have to admit,
I'm a bit of a fashion whore.

02:09.687 --> 02:12.724
Unfortunately, today I've got work,
and I have to tone it down a little bit,

02:12.967 --> 02:15.959
but that's all right. Gucci.
End-of-summer sale.

02:16.207 --> 02:20.564
Very understated.
And I can easily spice it up with...

02:21.127 --> 02:23.880
What? No, no. I know
what you are thinking.

02:24.127 --> 02:26.197
If you ooze masculinity,
like some of us do,

02:26.447 --> 02:29.564
you have no reason to fear pink.
Smashing.

02:30.927 --> 02:34.237
Now, in the cologne department,
most men overdo it.

02:34.487 --> 02:38.560
Americans practically spray it on
with a crop-duster.

02:38.807 --> 02:42.004
My rule: Nothing above the neck,

02:42.247 --> 02:45.557
though I do like a little splash
on Big Ben.

02:45.927 --> 02:48.157
You never know
where the day may take you.

02:51.287 --> 02:53.084
Almost forgot.

02:53.847 --> 02:55.166
New word for the day.

02:56.887 --> 03:02.962
"Ostentatious: The attempt
to attract attention to oneself."

03:03.207 --> 03:05.562
Who? Me?

03:07.767 --> 03:10.839
Oh, blimey. I'm so rude.
I haven't introduced myself.

03:11.087 --> 03:13.362
- I'm...
- Alfie?

03:13.927 --> 03:16.077
There you go. Alfie.

03:16.327 --> 03:20.957
Are you the little elf that left these
mocha bonbons on my doorstep?

03:21.207 --> 03:24.756
No, no, no. You must have
a secret admirer, Mrs Schnitman.

03:25.007 --> 03:28.795
You are such a doll, Alfie.
But I'm supposed to be on a diet.

03:29.047 --> 03:30.002
Oh, on a diet?

03:30.247 --> 03:31.362
- A diet.
- You?

03:31.607 --> 03:33.882
- Yeah.
- Now, I don't mean to be forward, Lu,

03:34.127 --> 03:37.802
but you should know by now
that a full-figured girl like yourself

03:38.007 --> 03:40.726
- is every guy's secret fantasy.
- Stop it.

03:40.927 --> 03:43.316
So she's a tub of lard.
The ship's already sailed,

03:43.567 --> 03:45.842
so why not make her
feel good about herself, right?

03:46.087 --> 03:47.805
- Oh, Lu?
- Yes, angel?

03:48.047 --> 03:49.036
I'm working the night spot,

03:49.247 --> 03:51.681
and my apartment is a horror show,
so I'm sorry if I keep you up

03:51.927 --> 03:54.441
- with the dust-busting at 2 a.m.
- Oh, don't you worry.

03:54.687 --> 03:57.724
- I'll give it a quick straighten.
- Oh, no, no, you don't need to that.

03:57.967 --> 04:01.482
Nonsense.
I like doing things for you, Alfie.

04:01.927 --> 04:04.680
I'm a blessed man
having you in my life.

04:06.607 --> 04:07.676
Thank you.

04:08.167 --> 04:10.283
Keys are in the usual spot.

04:16.007 --> 04:18.680
Now, back home, you're always
hearing tales about some bloke

04:18.927 --> 04:21.918
migrating to the States and winding
up with buckets of money.

04:22.167 --> 04:26.285
So not long ago, I packed up
my bucket and headed west.

04:26.527 --> 04:29.280
Now, I must admit,
I had a second motive.

04:30.007 --> 04:34.683
I'd always been told that the most
beautiful women in the world...

04:35.807 --> 04:37.399
...resided in Manhattan.

04:37.647 --> 04:40.844
And when it comes to shagging birds,
it's all about one thing:

04:41.367 --> 04:46.077
Location, location, location.

04:46.327 --> 04:49.000
God, I love this city.
All right, girls.

04:49.687 --> 04:53.726
Just look around. I mean,
every one of them, unique, special,

04:53.967 --> 04:55.764
like snowflakes.

04:58.487 --> 04:59.806
And with such a plethora...

05:00.407 --> 05:04.446
Calendar word meaning "abundance,"
of gorgeousness and diversity,

05:04.687 --> 05:08.566
well, how could a man ever choose
to settle down with just one?

05:09.967 --> 05:13.084
I myself subscribe more
to the European philosophy of life.

05:13.327 --> 05:16.558
My priorities leaning towards
wine, women...

05:16.807 --> 05:18.843
Well, actually, that's about it.

05:19.087 --> 05:20.918
Wine and women.

05:22.967 --> 05:27.119
Although, women and women
is always a fun option.

05:30.127 --> 05:31.560
So...

05:32.287 --> 05:34.801
...to live life to the fullest,

05:35.687 --> 05:39.236
I require only enough
to cover my modest expenses.

05:40.367 --> 05:43.643
I've no desire to be the richest stiff
in the cemetery.

05:53.407 --> 05:56.683
I think this might just be my
favourite position.

05:56.927 --> 05:59.395
I know it was President Kennedy's.

06:00.487 --> 06:02.557
He was such a great leader.

06:02.807 --> 06:05.082
Of course, JFK used the old
bad-back excuse,

06:05.327 --> 06:08.285
but if you ask me, he knew
it gave you maximum pleasure

06:08.527 --> 06:09.926
with minimum exertion.

06:10.167 --> 06:12.806
What is it about the back of a limo?

06:17.087 --> 06:19.203
Obligatory cuddling.

06:19.727 --> 06:21.524
Thousand one,

06:21.767 --> 06:23.883
thousand two...

06:24.127 --> 06:28.405
Cripes. Hey, I've gotta get cracking.
I've got a 10:00 pickup.

06:28.647 --> 06:33.675
You better hurry up.
You don't want to keep her waiting.

06:38.887 --> 06:41.355
Quite the number, isn't she?

06:42.127 --> 06:46.803
Yet, she tells me her old man
hasn't shagged her in six months.

06:47.407 --> 06:51.525
Six months. I mean, thank God
there are gentlemen like me around

06:51.767 --> 06:53.723
to pick up the slack.

06:54.127 --> 06:57.642
Just look at her.
Legs like a racehorse.

06:57.887 --> 07:01.721
Perfect yoga bum. I give her
my highest grade:

07:02.167 --> 07:03.885
A-minus.

07:13.807 --> 07:15.763
Where did we tell the old man
we were going tonight?

07:16.007 --> 07:18.680
- A movie.
- Treasure, please, no, no, no.

07:18.927 --> 07:21.725
Stop messing about.
You'll ruin my presets.

07:21.967 --> 07:24.356
- Sorry.
- What movie?

07:24.607 --> 07:27.041
I don't know. What's the difference?

07:27.527 --> 07:31.964
The difference is, the more detail
you give, the less interested he'll be.

07:32.207 --> 07:33.925
It wouldn't matter what I said.

07:34.367 --> 07:36.119
It would never occur to Phil
that another man

07:36.367 --> 07:38.119
- would ever look twice at me.
- Dor, darling,

07:38.367 --> 07:39.436
you fishing for a compliment?

07:39.847 --> 07:40.962
No.

07:41.207 --> 07:45.564
You should know by now they only
come from me when least expected.

07:46.607 --> 07:50.043
Now, come and have a mint so Phil
doesn't smell the Alfie on your breath.

07:50.287 --> 07:52.801
I don't care if he does.

07:53.367 --> 07:57.440
There's one thing that puts me
off marriage: It's married women.

07:57.847 --> 07:59.883
Dorie doesn't know it yet,

08:00.367 --> 08:02.722
but you won't be seeing
much more of her.

08:02.967 --> 08:05.481
I've got that all-too-familiar feeling.

08:05.727 --> 08:10.039
Sooner or later, she'll be wanting
a little bit more than I'm able to give.

08:11.367 --> 08:13.597
Wouldn't it be great if I was
going home with you tonight

08:13.847 --> 08:16.315
instead of Phil the Pill?

08:16.887 --> 08:18.445
Yeah.

08:18.927 --> 08:22.317
It's definitely time
to stage a disappearing act.

08:24.927 --> 08:28.237
So next Tuesday,
same time, same place?

08:29.727 --> 08:33.082
I'm sorry, love, it's Fashion Week.
I'm booked double shifts.

08:33.927 --> 08:36.600
- I'll call you the instant things let up.
- Okay.

08:37.366 --> 08:41.121
In the meantime, I left you
a little souvenir to remember me by.

08:45.367 --> 08:47.005
Oh, Dor?

08:48.887 --> 08:53.005
Your derrière looks really rather
ravishing from this vantage point.

08:55.647 --> 08:57.046
See?

08:57.727 --> 09:00.878
A compliment when least expected.

09:07.367 --> 09:10.916
What can I say?
Happy as a pup with two tails.

09:12.807 --> 09:16.038
And I think I've done old Phil
a bit of a favour too.

09:16.287 --> 09:18.198
Of course, he'd be the last to see it.

09:20.927 --> 09:24.158
Never expect any thanks in this life.

09:24.407 --> 09:28.400
You know what I mean?
So Tuesday...

09:30.367 --> 09:32.278
...10:03 p.m.

09:32.527 --> 09:37.203
Do I drag myself home
to a cold flat, empty fridge,

09:37.447 --> 09:44.285
or nip across town for a hot bath,
warm body, breakfast in bed?

09:47.247 --> 09:49.920
Decisions, decisions...

09:57.927 --> 10:01.317
Yeah, I think I'll pay a visit
to my semi-regular,

10:01.567 --> 10:04.639
quasi, sort of girlfriend.

10:05.847 --> 10:07.883
My sweet Julie.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.517
Let me guess.
Unexpected last-minute fare.

10:15.767 --> 10:18.839
Yeah. She had me going
up and down for hours.

10:19.087 --> 10:22.557
That supposed to be funny?
Because it is so very...

10:23.287 --> 10:24.845
Not.

10:25.647 --> 10:27.126
Hey!

10:28.087 --> 10:30.282
I'm not kidding, Alfie!

10:30.647 --> 10:32.126
I'm not kidding. I hate you sometimes.

10:32.327 --> 10:34.079
You have a very ostentatious way
of showing it.

10:34.327 --> 10:35.999
Yeah, I sure do.

10:38.007 --> 10:42.876
No, darling. Can we hit pause?
I just need a second to unwind.

10:43.567 --> 10:46.400
Oh, I nicked half a bottle
of Stoli from the limo.

10:46.647 --> 10:48.000
How do you want yours,
on the rocks?

10:48.247 --> 10:50.715
I just want my usual, Alfie. Straight up.

10:50.967 --> 10:54.084
No, I'm so totally knackered.
I'll make it up to you in the morning.

10:54.327 --> 10:56.397
Cross my heart.

10:57.087 --> 11:01.524
But tonight, all I'm good for
is a bite to eat, hot bath

11:01.767 --> 11:03.758
and a nice long sleep.

11:16.847 --> 11:18.997
You know, this isn't
a Holiday Inn, Alfie.

11:20.287 --> 11:21.879
What's that again?

11:22.687 --> 11:25.155
Where were you tonight? Really?

11:25.407 --> 11:27.762
You've got to open a restaurant.
That's seriously delicious.

11:28.007 --> 11:30.726
Thanks, Alfie. It's just chilli.

11:31.807 --> 11:33.126
Hey.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.925
A little eye contact, please.

11:38.647 --> 11:40.444
We have something here,

11:40.967 --> 11:45.722
or am I just a glorified booty call?

11:46.447 --> 11:47.800
Hey.

11:50.687 --> 11:52.040
Hey.

11:54.887 --> 11:56.718
Here's what she's really saying:

11:56.967 --> 12:00.880
She wants me to commit.
Translation: Become "domestified."

12:01.127 --> 12:06.201
Now, it doesn't do to become
dependent on anybody in this life.

12:09.527 --> 12:12.963
Change your nature,
you're a dead man.

12:14.607 --> 12:16.484
Chilli, please.

12:21.487 --> 12:24.445
Don't get me wrong.
She's adorable.

12:24.687 --> 12:28.157
Cute? Absolutely.
But is it ever enough?

12:30.207 --> 12:33.244
I told you how we men are.
We want showstoppers.

12:33.607 --> 12:36.201
And the problem is,
Julie hasn't got enough

12:36.407 --> 12:39.001
of the superficial things
that really matter.

12:42.247 --> 12:45.683
- I don't deserve you.
- Yeah, that's probably true.

12:46.807 --> 12:49.241
Too bad I love you.

12:51.127 --> 12:52.845
Thanks, babe.

12:53.087 --> 12:56.159
- Alfie, Alfie...
- What?

12:57.007 --> 12:59.601
You're giving me the "Thanks, babe."

13:00.127 --> 13:02.163
You're giving me the "Thanks, baby."

13:02.407 --> 13:04.477
- Calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down!

13:04.847 --> 13:06.405
- I know how you feel!
- Wait a minute.

13:06.647 --> 13:09.002
- You're gonna wake up...
- Max.

13:10.087 --> 13:12.362
Hey, little man. Did we wake you up?

13:12.607 --> 13:14.245
Yes.

13:17.007 --> 13:20.477
Now, lads, learn from my mistake.

13:21.527 --> 13:23.438
Never get involved
with a single mum.

13:23.687 --> 13:26.042
See, they come with accessories,

13:26.287 --> 13:27.925
some of which can be...

13:29.247 --> 13:32.842
...unfortunately, irresistible.

13:49.527 --> 13:54.362
Sights like that make you realize
we all have an expiration date.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.761
And women do have a shorter
shelf life than men, don't they?

13:58.207 --> 14:00.641
I think that's what Julie
was banging on about yesterday.

14:03.367 --> 14:05.881
Elegant Limousine and Chauffeur.

14:06.127 --> 14:10.120
This is where I make
my reasonably honest living.

14:10.727 --> 14:13.924
Standards of elegance has taken
quite a pounding, wouldn't you say?

14:14.167 --> 14:17.125
I know. Believe me,
it's merely a stepping stone.

14:17.967 --> 14:19.844
Currently parked on one
of those stepping stones

14:20.087 --> 14:24.399
is my best mate and future
business partner, Marlon.

14:27.207 --> 14:30.438
Black. Like Lonette's skin...

14:31.527 --> 14:33.995
...which I will never again touch.

14:36.607 --> 14:40.236
I'm afraid you're not meeting
my man on top form.

14:41.207 --> 14:43.482
See, Marlon's got a problem.

14:54.367 --> 14:56.198
It's called Lonette.

14:56.447 --> 14:59.086
And very recently, it dumped him.

14:59.327 --> 15:01.079
Oh, dear. Come on,
what was it this time?

15:02.407 --> 15:05.240
Three a.m. begging, at her front door.

15:05.487 --> 15:08.206
- Level of inebriation?
- Vomiting.

15:08.807 --> 15:11.275
Right. So let me get this straight.
You were at her front door,

15:11.527 --> 15:14.724
3 a.m. in the morning,
begging and vomiting?

15:15.207 --> 15:18.756
And what,
she wasn't charmed by that?

15:19.847 --> 15:24.602
Alfie? Why is there no Stoli
in car number two?

15:24.847 --> 15:26.599
I've no idea.

15:27.287 --> 15:30.359
I gotta watch this guy like a hawk.

15:30.607 --> 15:32.086
That little chap's name is Wing.

15:32.327 --> 15:35.478
My boss and owner
of this tragic enterprise.

15:35.727 --> 15:38.321
- Wipe that car good.
- Owner, that is, till me and Marlon

15:38.527 --> 15:40.882
swing a loan and buy it out
from underneath his scrawny...

15:41.127 --> 15:44.039
Hello. You miss bird shit.

15:46.847 --> 15:48.519
Wing.

15:48.767 --> 15:50.564
He's barking mad.

15:50.807 --> 15:53.082
Check out the way he talks
to the little woman.

15:55.367 --> 15:58.200
She's given him her best years,
cooked his chop suey,

15:58.447 --> 16:00.881
helped with the business, and I bet
at one time he couldn't wait

16:01.127 --> 16:03.516
to rip off her kimono.
And now look at him.

16:07.487 --> 16:11.275
And I'm supposed to respect
the institution of marriage?

16:14.967 --> 16:17.925
That's a great figure, man.
We swing that loan,

16:18.167 --> 16:21.045
cash your IRA, I hock my Vespa...

16:21.287 --> 16:25.280
We're gonna take Wing
by surprise with an offer like this.

16:32.287 --> 16:35.085
I could've predicted this. See,
Marlon and Lonette have reached

16:35.327 --> 16:37.682
that critical 18-month "Where are
we going, what are we doing,

16:37.927 --> 16:40.646
what's happening here?" crisis point
that rears its ugly head

16:40.887 --> 16:44.926
in every relationship.
Lonette wanted ring, home, baby.

16:45.167 --> 16:47.886
Marlon wanted another 18 months

16:48.127 --> 16:50.197
to make sure nothing better
was coming his way.

16:50.447 --> 16:52.677
I fucked up egregiously.

16:52.927 --> 16:55.839
I see you're making the most
of that birthday calendar.

16:56.527 --> 17:00.566
By the time he realized he'd made
a mistake and he wanted her back...

17:01.607 --> 17:04.326
...it was too late.
- Hey, stranger.

17:05.887 --> 17:07.366
Hey.

17:13.727 --> 17:15.205
Carol.

17:15.446 --> 17:18.405
- Carol. Hi, Carol.
- Hi.

17:19.047 --> 17:20.877
You look wonderful.

17:24.327 --> 17:28.115
So, Carol, well, it's nice
to see you again. You be well.

17:36.087 --> 17:37.236
What's up with that?

17:37.487 --> 17:40.843
Put it this way, the show closed
after one performance only.

17:41.087 --> 17:42.725
- Do I even wanna know why?
- No. Come on,

17:42.967 --> 17:45.959
it would be less than discreet
to tell you why.

17:47.887 --> 17:51.323
Hair on the arms. Seriously.
Long, thick...

17:51.567 --> 17:54.639
What are you talking about?
You don't have hair on your arms?

17:55.647 --> 17:58.719
- You're looking very lovely tonight.
- Thank you.

18:06.127 --> 18:09.915
Dude, the iron door
has slammed shut, man.

18:12.847 --> 18:14.724
Classic, isn't it?

18:14.967 --> 18:18.642
Now that he can't have her,
he thinks he can't live without her.

18:19.047 --> 18:21.083
Some people are funny.

18:22.327 --> 18:24.841
Marlon's predicament got me thinking
about my own situation.

18:28.327 --> 18:32.366
Maybe... Maybe it was time
to stoke the home fires.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.959
Anybody in the mood
for a little Alfie, straight up?

18:38.207 --> 18:42.280
Oh, this isn't a good time, Alfie.
Got a lot on my mind.

18:42.527 --> 18:46.520
Oh, God. Yeah, I really hate
when that happens.

18:46.767 --> 18:51.363
Open up, baby.
You look seriously beautiful.

18:51.607 --> 18:54.679
- Not tonight, Alfred.
- What's the matter? Tell me.

18:54.927 --> 18:58.522
I don't... I'm just...
Well, I guess I'm... I'm just...

18:58.767 --> 19:02.316
I'm just seeing red.

19:16.967 --> 19:18.878
I mean, the poor guy, he's dying.

19:19.127 --> 19:21.436
Come on, haven't you...?
You've tortured him long enough.

19:21.687 --> 19:23.325
Alfie, he should've thought
about all that

19:23.567 --> 19:26.286
before he was screwing around
with that ex-girlfriend of his.

19:26.527 --> 19:28.722
Those fake-ass, $5 titties.

19:29.327 --> 19:31.716
- Those are fake?
- Hello?

19:31.967 --> 19:35.198
Wow, I'm devastated.
They've got, like...

19:35.607 --> 19:38.917
Alfie, you're supposed to be consoling
my devastation, remember?

19:39.167 --> 19:41.317
I am. Look, he came back, didn't he?

19:41.567 --> 19:43.842
Begging, crawling on his knees,
vomiting...

19:44.087 --> 19:45.645
I don't care.

19:45.887 --> 19:49.846
I'm sorry, I'm not that easy. I don't
forgive and I definitely do not forget.

19:50.087 --> 19:52.282
- Is okay if I leave now, miss?
- Oh, sí, Felix.

19:52.527 --> 19:55.121
And hit the lights on your way out,
por favor.

19:59.127 --> 20:00.845
I better go.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.597
It's really coming down out there.

20:03.847 --> 20:05.678
Yeah.

20:06.647 --> 20:08.763
And I'm wearing suede.

20:09.847 --> 20:12.441
You're telling the truth. That's brilliant.

20:13.607 --> 20:17.122
Okay. I got one. I never swam
in the Pacific Ocean.

20:18.087 --> 20:21.636
- Me neither.
- Oh, shit. Okay.

20:23.207 --> 20:28.679
Okay. I've never seen
a James Bond movie.

20:29.207 --> 20:31.038
You're joking.
Not even a Sean Connery?

20:32.047 --> 20:33.275
You serious?

20:33.527 --> 20:37.645
Wow, I don't know
if that's magic or tragic.

20:39.167 --> 20:40.805
Okay. Five ball. My go.

20:41.567 --> 20:45.082
- I've never made my own bed.
- Oh, bullshit.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.318
No, I repeat, I've never
made my own bed.

20:47.567 --> 20:50.081
Well, what kind of mama you got?

20:50.647 --> 20:52.126
That's a good question.

20:58.887 --> 21:01.003
Let's see. All right.

21:01.247 --> 21:03.761
- I got something for you.
- All right.

21:03.967 --> 21:06.845
I've never had sex...

21:07.087 --> 21:09.760
I've never had sex
with two people in one night.

21:11.247 --> 21:13.283
Six-five, your favour.

21:13.527 --> 21:15.199
Gotcha.

21:17.727 --> 21:20.878
So, Alfie, what's the most
you've had in one night?

21:24.887 --> 21:27.401
We've stopped playing the game,
haven't we?

21:30.767 --> 21:35.158
Am I wrong, or is there a little
innocent flirting going on here?

21:47.127 --> 21:51.166
Driftin' on a memory

21:51.727 --> 21:57.324
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Than with you

21:59.087 --> 22:02.238
Loving you

22:10.647 --> 22:12.877
See, if I had that kind of talent...

22:13.127 --> 22:14.879
And a song

22:15.127 --> 22:18.164
- Go on, finish your sentence.
- If I had that kind of talent,

22:18.847 --> 22:21.725
and I looked like you...

22:21.967 --> 22:23.446
And a song

22:23.687 --> 22:25.757
...I would be strutting my stuff
- Oh, yeah?

22:25.967 --> 22:28.083
on a stage.

22:48.047 --> 22:51.039
Trust me, what happens next
was the furthest thing from my mind

22:51.247 --> 22:53.124
when I dropped by tonight.

22:54.447 --> 22:57.837
But then I thought to myself,

22:58.087 --> 22:59.361
"You know what?

22:59.607 --> 23:02.360
If this will help her get past
her anger towards Marlon,

23:02.607 --> 23:05.758
I owe it to both of them,
as a friend, right?

23:06.007 --> 23:08.601
To do whatever I can to help."

23:14.647 --> 23:16.683
I find that, lately,

23:17.247 --> 23:20.080
even lying to myself comes easily.

24:06.647 --> 24:10.435
The next morning, and I can't
get last night out of my mind.

24:10.967 --> 24:15.040
Try desperately to focus
on something else, anything else.

24:15.447 --> 24:18.598
Anything to get my mind
off my best friend's incredibly hot,

24:19.327 --> 24:22.956
best-ass-I've-ever-seen-in-my-life
girlfriend.

24:24.527 --> 24:27.121
Alfie. Alfie.

24:27.367 --> 24:29.961
- Alfie!
- Shall I pretend I can't hear him?

24:30.167 --> 24:31.646
Dude.

24:32.487 --> 24:35.081
- Hey!
- Too late. Too late.

24:35.327 --> 24:38.478
- Dude, would you slow down?
- Hey, Marly, what's up?

24:39.247 --> 24:40.236
"Marly"?

24:40.967 --> 24:43.322
Hey, listen, I gotta talk to you.
You ain't going nowhere

24:43.567 --> 24:45.205
till you tell me
what went down last night.

24:45.447 --> 24:47.915
- Down last night?
- Dude, don't mess with me.

24:48.167 --> 24:50.203
What happened with Lonette?

24:51.327 --> 24:53.283
Have you ever heard
the word "knock"?

24:53.527 --> 24:56.200
- What went down?
- What? Nothing happened.

24:56.447 --> 24:59.598
- We had a few shots.
- Missus give me silent treatment.

24:59.847 --> 25:03.396
Little she know, not hearing constant
"blah, blah, blah" is gift from heaven.

25:03.647 --> 25:05.399
You keep it up. Keep it up,
mate, it'll work.

25:05.647 --> 25:07.524
Alfie, what happened?

25:09.007 --> 25:11.316
Oh, fuck a duck, man. Look, I...

25:12.927 --> 25:15.646
- I drank a lot last night.
- Drunk.

25:16.247 --> 25:18.044
Well, I...

25:19.727 --> 25:22.002
I really... I don't remember.

25:22.247 --> 25:24.761
- Dude, you did something to her.
- No.

25:25.007 --> 25:26.963
Oh, yeah, you did.
Because she shows up at my house,

25:27.207 --> 25:29.198
at 4 in the morning,
saying that she wanted me back.

25:29.447 --> 25:32.245
She even said
that if I needed more time,

25:32.487 --> 25:35.285
that she understood completely.

25:35.527 --> 25:37.119
How fucking crazy.

25:39.207 --> 25:43.564
Chalk one up for the blokes.
Thanks to me, Marlon won the game.

25:43.847 --> 25:45.963
Which means he's off scot-free,
and so am I.

25:46.207 --> 25:48.801
This is a bloody miracle.
That's fantastic. Fantastic.

25:49.007 --> 25:50.998
- Come on, what did you say to her?
- Look, look.

25:51.247 --> 25:53.715
- It's all good.
- Come on, what did you say?

25:55.127 --> 25:56.401
I asked her to marry me.

26:01.967 --> 26:04.322
You know you're my best man, right?

26:05.607 --> 26:07.438
Moral of the story:

26:07.687 --> 26:10.759
No good deed goes unpunished.

27:04.527 --> 27:06.040
New word for the day?

27:08.487 --> 27:09.681
"Resilience:

27:10.407 --> 27:15.003
The ability to readily recover
after disappointment or loss."

27:16.727 --> 27:19.366
Capacity to spring back.

27:19.607 --> 27:22.519
Understand, it's not
about replacing Julie.

27:22.767 --> 27:25.235
I just wanna get back
to the simple life:

27:25.487 --> 27:28.001
Women who mean nothing to me.

27:30.007 --> 27:33.795
So I've struck up a friendship
with a nightclub hostess called Uta.

27:34.047 --> 27:35.480
Hello, Uta.

27:49.247 --> 27:51.477
Now, as a heat-seeking bachelor,

27:51.727 --> 27:53.479
I have to live
by some very simple rules.

27:53.727 --> 27:56.446
Alfie Elkins' credo or philosophy,

27:56.687 --> 27:59.679
which is probably best summed up
by the only advice

27:59.927 --> 28:01.804
my father ever gave me.

28:02.047 --> 28:06.325
He said, "Son, whenever you
meet a beautiful woman...

28:07.767 --> 28:11.601
...just remember, somewhere there's
a bloke who's sick of shagging her."

28:11.847 --> 28:13.997
- Can I help you, man?
- G and T, please.

28:14.447 --> 28:18.486
Explain to me what everyone sees
in that Eurotrash?

28:35.927 --> 28:39.317
I think it's incredibly unfair
that it's acceptable for men

28:39.567 --> 28:41.319
to be sexually experimental,
then with a woman,

28:41.567 --> 28:45.606
if she wants to try something...
A kiss or a threesome.

28:45.847 --> 28:48.441
You know, that they'd be judged.
I wouldn't judge them.

28:48.687 --> 28:51.281
And I think if you two were to kiss,
I would... I would just...

28:51.487 --> 28:55.958
I would just see it
as a thing of beauty.

28:57.167 --> 28:59.840
Although I'm living every guy's
Rat Pack fantasy,

29:00.087 --> 29:02.521
something feels a bit off.

29:02.767 --> 29:04.598
And throwing myself
back into the old lifestyle

29:04.847 --> 29:06.963
isn't going quite as smoothly
as I'd hoped.

29:07.207 --> 29:08.560
Sorry.

29:08.807 --> 29:10.320
I'm sorry.

29:11.047 --> 29:13.163
You carry on without me.

29:13.767 --> 29:16.361
Oh, my loves, l...

29:16.567 --> 29:19.445
I don't know what happened.
This is so unlike me.

29:20.167 --> 29:23.477
Yeah, you... You two just...

29:30.327 --> 29:33.444
I used to think
there was nothing worse than death.

29:36.007 --> 29:38.840
Then, from out of nowhere...

29:40.927 --> 29:41.996
...the unthinkable.

29:44.367 --> 29:47.996
Now I really don't get
what everyone sees in you.

29:51.527 --> 29:54.405
It just keeps on happening
and happening.

29:55.087 --> 29:58.159
Or more accurately, not happening
and not happening.

30:00.207 --> 30:03.483
This never happens, Uta.
Honestly, never.

30:06.647 --> 30:08.080
Honestly.

30:08.767 --> 30:11.201
Not the word around town...

30:12.727 --> 30:14.285
...peewee.

30:19.167 --> 30:22.443
Mr Elkins? Miranda Kulp.

30:23.807 --> 30:25.365
Miranda.

30:25.607 --> 30:28.121
The penis doctor is a he
with a little bit of she thrown in.

30:28.367 --> 30:31.723
So I understand you're experiencing
some erectile dysfunction.

30:32.247 --> 30:36.877
I am experiencing a little... A little...
A little bit of... What you just said.

30:37.127 --> 30:39.357
Not to worry.
That's my area of expertise.

30:40.167 --> 30:44.479
So have you been under any unusual
emotional stress lately, Mr Elkins?

30:44.727 --> 30:48.276
Stress? Emotional? Me? No, never.

30:49.887 --> 30:54.039
Well, unless you count
that recent chat I had with Julie.

30:54.287 --> 30:55.800
I can't see you anymore, Alfie.

30:57.727 --> 30:59.877
- Why? You angry?
- No, I'm really not angry.

31:00.127 --> 31:03.563
Just, you know,
we want different things.

31:04.607 --> 31:07.565
And I can't have you traipsing
in and out of Max's life.

31:12.367 --> 31:15.006
You've changed your hair,
haven't you?

31:15.247 --> 31:16.600
You have, haven't you?
No, you have.

31:16.847 --> 31:18.838
You've changed your hairdo.
You cut it?

31:19.087 --> 31:20.725
It looks gorgeous.

31:20.967 --> 31:22.958
- Thanks.
- How come...?

31:24.047 --> 31:26.925
How come you never had it like that
when we were together?

31:27.167 --> 31:28.759
I really gotta go.

31:32.647 --> 31:34.046
Well, I guess...

31:35.047 --> 31:36.480
...you need these back.

31:39.127 --> 31:40.640
Thank you.

31:44.847 --> 31:46.644
Alfie?

31:47.287 --> 31:48.515
You gonna be okay?

31:49.527 --> 31:52.997
Yeah. No worries. I'm always okay.

31:57.647 --> 32:01.959
Alrighty, let's take a gander
at that penis of yours.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.838
I see.

32:15.727 --> 32:17.080
Well.

32:17.327 --> 32:19.921
- It seems we have lift-off.
- It seems we do.

32:20.127 --> 32:21.719
Wunderschön.

32:22.167 --> 32:23.566
What a relief.

32:24.127 --> 32:26.721
Well, I mean, if he can give me
a stiffy, I should have no problem

32:26.927 --> 32:29.646
keeping it up for the target
demographic, shouldn't I?

32:29.887 --> 32:32.685
Well, there doesn't appear
to be anything physiologically wrong,

32:32.927 --> 32:35.600
so, in short, we can be
fairly certain your problem

32:35.847 --> 32:39.840
- was simply stress-related.
- Translation: Julie-related.

32:40.087 --> 32:44.239
Like I always say, if they don't get you
one way, they'll get you another.

32:45.407 --> 32:46.999
However,

32:47.767 --> 32:53.000
- I did feel something a little kooky.
- Kooky?

32:53.247 --> 32:56.205
There is nothing to get upset about,
Mr Elkins.

32:57.007 --> 33:00.477
I thought I felt a lump...

33:02.007 --> 33:03.804
...on your penis.

33:04.047 --> 33:06.561
But with any luck, it will be nothing.

33:08.287 --> 33:11.643
The words "lump" and "penis"
in the same sentence.

33:11.887 --> 33:14.162
There's something
you don't hear every day.

33:15.247 --> 33:19.240
And so young Alfred
got an early Yuletide gift.

33:20.887 --> 33:23.082
A penis biopsy.

33:23.327 --> 33:26.239
I get my test results in three days...
Well, five.

33:26.487 --> 33:29.957
Five counting the weekend.
Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord.

33:30.207 --> 33:32.801
How am I gonna stop myself
going completely bonkers?

33:33.007 --> 33:34.042
I'll be fine.

33:34.767 --> 33:36.678
I'll be fine.

33:36.927 --> 33:38.838
I'm a young man.

33:40.487 --> 33:43.160
Shift focus, Alfie. Shift...

33:43.407 --> 33:45.602
Let's go, kids. Let's go.

33:52.727 --> 33:55.082
Move along, children.
Look straight ahead.

33:55.767 --> 33:58.281
Come on. Do not look at the man.
Look straight ahead.

33:58.527 --> 34:01.963
In the meantime, perhaps I'm safer
hobbling on home.

34:17.806 --> 34:20.879
Alfie, dear, what's wrong?
You look like death warmed over.

34:21.127 --> 34:23.641
No, I've just... I've got a bit of
a football injury, that's all,

34:23.887 --> 34:25.605
Mrs Schnitman...
Hello, Mrs Liberman.

34:25.847 --> 34:27.280
You two look lovely.
Where you going?

34:27.527 --> 34:30.041
- Shopping. You need anything?
- I'm fine.

34:32.647 --> 34:33.636
Hello.

34:34.327 --> 34:36.204
Can I talk to you for a minute?

34:36.887 --> 34:38.366
Ladies, this is my friend Lonette.

34:38.607 --> 34:42.839
She's lovely. Good for you,
dating an African-American.

34:43.087 --> 34:44.520
Yeah.

34:45.687 --> 34:49.679
Hey. Hey, girl. I missed you.

34:49.927 --> 34:53.442
Don't mind us. We're not here.
You kids keep talking.

34:53.687 --> 34:56.121
- Very nice to meet you.
- See you, Mrs Liberman.

34:56.367 --> 34:57.880
Shop till you drop, girls.

35:00.727 --> 35:02.319
So how have you been?

35:04.247 --> 35:06.078
I'm pregnant.

35:07.807 --> 35:09.399
It seems to me

35:09.607 --> 35:13.395
the problems you worry yourself
sick about never seem to materialize.

35:13.607 --> 35:15.677
It's the ones that catch you
unexpectedly

35:15.887 --> 35:19.243
on a Wednesday afternoon
that knock you sideways.

35:21.327 --> 35:23.795
I offered to face the music
with her...

35:24.007 --> 35:26.441
...but she wanted to go it alone.

35:43.207 --> 35:47.086
We both knew that if the baby
was born with any white-boy features

35:47.287 --> 35:49.881
it would mean the end
of Lonette and Marlon.

35:50.447 --> 35:53.405
Not to mention your host
for this evening.

35:54.607 --> 35:59.476
But standing in the cold,
I find myself having regrets.

35:59.687 --> 36:01.325
Thinking thoughts like,

36:01.527 --> 36:04.963
"Here's another kid you'll never
get a chance to know.

36:05.167 --> 36:07.123
Your own."

36:24.207 --> 36:25.686
Didn't take long.

36:34.087 --> 36:36.442
Bloody hell, you're freezing.

36:38.927 --> 36:40.121
How do you feel?

36:41.047 --> 36:42.765
Empty.

36:55.967 --> 36:59.926
That night in the bar, I thought
I was getting something for nothing.

37:00.807 --> 37:03.958
Doesn't seem to have worked out
that way, does it?

37:17.047 --> 37:18.002
Oh, man.

37:18.647 --> 37:21.878
If everything turns out okay,
maybe this little brush with mortality

37:22.087 --> 37:23.236
is a sign.

37:23.927 --> 37:28.398
I should think about making...
Making some changes.

37:28.647 --> 37:29.841
Possibly.

37:30.847 --> 37:31.916
- Next week.
- Excuse me.

37:32.127 --> 37:35.005
Did I just...? Did you just look at me?
Did I just notice you turn away?

37:35.207 --> 37:38.517
Look, if you know the results
to my tests, and they're telling you...

37:38.727 --> 37:40.319
- Mr Elkins.
- Please. Please.

37:40.527 --> 37:44.805
Mr Elkins, for the millionth time,
sit down.

37:45.727 --> 37:50.642
Mr Belson, I have a cancellation
on Tuesday at 11:30.

37:50.847 --> 37:52.803
I'm gonna be fine.

37:53.967 --> 37:56.162
- I just feel it.
- Thank you. Goodbye.

38:04.607 --> 38:07.519
I'll just be a minute. Or ten.

38:08.647 --> 38:10.956
- It's all right. Take your time.
- I don't have a choice.

38:11.167 --> 38:14.125
I used to pee. Now I trickle.

38:14.327 --> 38:17.080
- I'm Joe. What's your name?
- Alfie.

38:17.847 --> 38:20.361
So how you doing, Alfie?

38:20.567 --> 38:24.321
- Hanging in. You?
- Shitty.

38:25.687 --> 38:28.121
Yeah, me too. Me too.

38:29.047 --> 38:32.926
- I like the bolo tie.
- Oh, thanks. I have a collection.

38:35.527 --> 38:38.121
You know, when you're old,
you learn to be patient.

38:38.687 --> 38:39.642
Yeah.

38:39.847 --> 38:42.281
Used to be I never
had time for nothing. Go, go, go.

38:42.487 --> 38:44.398
- I know that feeling.
- Yeah.

38:44.607 --> 38:49.158
My wife was always hawking me
to take a little vacation. Hawaii. Reno.

38:49.367 --> 38:51.483
I always said,
"Next year, Evie, next year.

38:51.687 --> 38:53.757
I got too much on my platter."

38:54.367 --> 38:56.676
I always thought
I'd have more time.

38:56.887 --> 39:00.436
Then one Sunday night,
she takes the pot roast out of the oven.

39:00.647 --> 39:04.481
Yells, "Soup's on,"
and slumps to the kitchen floor.

39:04.687 --> 39:06.405
Just like that.

39:06.607 --> 39:08.438
Dead as disco.

39:08.647 --> 39:10.877
Jesus, I'm sorry.

39:11.087 --> 39:13.476
I tried picking up the pieces.

39:13.687 --> 39:16.121
Even went to Waikiki alone
on the 8-day cruise package

39:16.327 --> 39:18.283
she was always yakking about.

39:18.847 --> 39:21.281
Couldn't get Evie out of my mind.

39:24.967 --> 39:27.481
There's two things
I learned in life, kid:

39:27.687 --> 39:29.325
You find someone to love,

39:29.567 --> 39:32.001
and live every day
as though it were your last.

39:36.047 --> 39:37.765
She's all yours, Alfie.

39:37.967 --> 39:39.446
Enjoy.

39:47.207 --> 39:48.925
You all right, son?

39:49.127 --> 39:52.244
Yeah. I hope so.

39:55.127 --> 39:58.597
Look, if you ever get bored
or feel like schmoozing...

39:59.887 --> 40:02.037
...give me a holler.

40:04.047 --> 40:06.197
- You'll never call.
- Maybe I will.

40:06.447 --> 40:08.915
All right, good. We'll go to a bar
together, hit on some chicks.

40:09.127 --> 40:10.480
Damn right.

40:10.687 --> 40:12.279
Thanks, Joe.

40:15.127 --> 40:16.879
Hey.

40:18.407 --> 40:20.238
I'm sorry about Evie.

40:23.127 --> 40:24.799
We...

40:25.007 --> 40:27.475
...weren't all that fond
of each other...

40:27.687 --> 40:31.441
...but we were very close.

40:32.487 --> 40:36.116
- If you know what I mean.
- I think I do.

41:02.047 --> 41:05.437
I've been thinking a lot lately
about God and death.

41:05.647 --> 41:08.445
And how, if what they taught me
in Bible class is true,

41:08.647 --> 41:10.478
I'm really in for it.

41:13.447 --> 41:16.166
But I won't be partying
with Lucifer any time soon,

41:16.367 --> 41:18.244
because my test results
were negative.

41:18.447 --> 41:20.915
I'm gonna live! I'm gonna live!

41:26.927 --> 41:29.680
I ruined my Prada lace-ups
and I don't care.

41:33.127 --> 41:37.166
Don't think I've forgotten my oath
to completely change my life,

41:37.367 --> 41:39.119
because I haven't.

42:07.287 --> 42:10.165
Carrot-apple with a dash
of wheat grass.

42:10.367 --> 42:11.641
Yep.

42:12.447 --> 42:15.405
Health is now priority number one.

42:16.887 --> 42:20.038
Business plan
moves onto the fast track.

42:21.527 --> 42:25.122
- If you say so...
- Tonight's preview at St. Ambrose...

42:26.727 --> 42:31.039
No, I definitely don't want to talk.
Okay, hold on, what else have I got?

42:32.407 --> 42:35.365
Okay, yeah.

42:36.247 --> 42:38.044
All right, if we must, we must, but...

42:39.767 --> 42:42.679
New slate. New beginning.

43:02.927 --> 43:04.565
- What's your name, driver?
- Alfie, sir.

43:04.767 --> 43:05.722
Wait here, Alfie.

43:05.967 --> 43:08.037
Do you know how long
you're gonna be, roughly?

43:08.247 --> 43:10.841
- You got someplace to go?
- No, I was just gonna nip off

43:11.007 --> 43:13.601
- and get a cup of tea.
- Look, why don't you just stay put.

43:40.127 --> 43:42.163
Yea or nay?

43:43.647 --> 43:47.196
A definite yea, I think. Really.

43:47.407 --> 43:49.557
Stunning.
Wouldn't you say so, sir?

43:49.807 --> 43:52.196
I'm sorry, didn't I ask you
to wait by the car?

43:52.447 --> 43:55.086
I reckoned I should help
the lady with her packages.

43:55.327 --> 43:56.885
Definite yea?

43:58.807 --> 44:00.479
I think.

44:00.687 --> 44:03.599
With one minor...

44:03.807 --> 44:05.126
- May I?
- You may.

44:05.327 --> 44:06.806
Adjustment.

44:14.207 --> 44:17.961
Bullfighter. Another lifetime.
Don't ask.

44:21.367 --> 44:22.846
Fifty, if she's a day.

44:23.047 --> 44:24.480
But don't they say 50
is the new 40,

44:24.687 --> 44:26.882
and is she not living proof?

44:27.087 --> 44:29.840
I mean, have a look.
Beautifully preserved.

44:31.087 --> 44:33.601
And cleavage
like the Holland Tunnel.

44:35.127 --> 44:36.845
- Better?
- Much.

44:37.087 --> 44:40.716
You are so right to trust Chanel.
A pair of hot-pink stilettos,

44:40.927 --> 44:42.804
and you're good to go.

44:43.887 --> 44:46.845
- Well, aren't you Mr Full-Service?
- We try.

44:49.607 --> 44:52.679
- He's getting a little pissy, isn't he?
- Oh, it's fine. It's good for him.

44:52.887 --> 44:56.243
- Is your husband a lot older than you?
- He's not my husband.

44:57.367 --> 44:59.085
He's wearing a wedding ring.

44:59.287 --> 45:02.438
Well, I never said he wasn't
somebody else's husband.

45:13.567 --> 45:15.125
- Grab the stuff from the trunk?
- You got it.

45:15.327 --> 45:16.680
Cheers.

45:22.807 --> 45:26.163
Ma'am, if you require
my services in the future.

45:27.687 --> 45:30.918
Happy Christmas, sir. Ma'am.

45:32.847 --> 45:36.760
Now that, my friends,
is a real woman.

45:36.967 --> 45:39.561
Smart and sexy and...

45:39.967 --> 45:43.755
You noticed the little flirt
going on between us, huh?

45:47.647 --> 45:49.239
Makes me think,

45:49.447 --> 45:52.086
if a woman like that,
of that calibre

45:52.287 --> 45:53.686
should take notice
of a bloke like me,

45:53.887 --> 45:56.924
then, perhaps...

45:58.287 --> 46:01.916
Perhaps I'm selling myself
a bit short.

46:02.487 --> 46:04.159
In a flash,

46:04.367 --> 46:06.961
I have my New Year's resolution.

46:07.887 --> 46:09.639
Aim higher.

46:20.327 --> 46:23.558
Catastrophic. Doomed.

46:23.767 --> 46:26.804
Desolate. Cataclysmic.

46:27.007 --> 46:29.157
Bought him a word-of-the-day
calendar for Christmas.

46:29.927 --> 46:31.076
Big mistake.

46:31.287 --> 46:33.403
Holiday season,
busiest time of the year.

46:33.607 --> 46:34.881
I try to run a business.

46:35.087 --> 46:38.124
- What's the problem, Mr Wing?
- Your soul brother.

46:38.327 --> 46:40.318
He quit.

46:45.527 --> 46:48.837
In the letter Marlon left me,
he called me his best friend...

46:49.647 --> 46:52.878
...but apologized for bailing
on our business scheme.

46:53.087 --> 46:56.124
He said his whole thing now
was to make Lonette happy.

46:56.767 --> 46:58.405
They decided,
on the spur of the moment,

46:58.607 --> 47:00.563
to move upstate,

47:00.807 --> 47:03.560
and I had a standing
invite to drop by any time.

47:04.687 --> 47:07.520
Somehow Lonette
convinced Marlon

47:07.727 --> 47:10.605
it would be too painful
to say our goodbyes in person.

47:10.807 --> 47:12.604
And to make matters worse,

47:12.807 --> 47:16.322
it all dovetails into
the second loneliest night of the year:

47:19.247 --> 47:21.397
Christmas Eve.

47:23.247 --> 47:26.876
A night that brings on all those
familiar festive feelings

47:27.087 --> 47:32.320
of hopelessness,
anguish, despair.

47:32.927 --> 47:35.999
Not a great time to be flying solo.

47:36.607 --> 47:40.236
That's why I'm of the belief
couples should never split up

47:40.447 --> 47:42.597
between Thanksgiving
and January 2nd.

47:43.167 --> 47:46.921
Always have a relationship to see
you through the holidays. Always.

47:47.127 --> 47:49.880
The downside, of course, being gifts.

47:54.287 --> 47:57.279
Personally, I've always
suspected that everyone else

47:57.487 --> 48:00.240
is having a far merrier
Christmas than I am.

48:00.447 --> 48:03.803
Not that I've ever actually
had a Christmas.

48:04.687 --> 48:06.166
That's a whole other Dickens story.

48:06.367 --> 48:07.561
Taxi.

48:07.807 --> 48:09.286
Taxi.

48:09.887 --> 48:11.843
Excuse me.

48:13.367 --> 48:17.360
I'm sorry, mate, it's against the law
for me to carry any more than...

48:24.607 --> 48:26.962
Thank the Lord.

48:28.127 --> 48:30.482
A Christmas miracle.

48:34.407 --> 48:36.523
All right, hop in.

48:36.727 --> 48:39.844
Thanks for saving us.
I was freezing my little tush off.

48:40.087 --> 48:42.999
No worries. You know,
it's pretty full back there.

48:43.247 --> 48:46.000
- Why don't you...
- Good idea.

48:46.207 --> 48:47.401
Why don't I?

48:49.447 --> 48:51.403
Hey, watch the champagne.

48:55.287 --> 48:56.925
All in.

49:06.407 --> 49:10.161
- They don't get out much.
- You wanna watch out, you guys.

49:10.367 --> 49:13.598
You'll end up with a lump of coal
in your stocking.

49:13.807 --> 49:15.320
You're English.

49:15.527 --> 49:17.358
I love English.

49:17.607 --> 49:19.643
- What's your name?
- Alfie.

49:27.607 --> 49:30.201
You wanna abuse
a little substance, Alfie?

49:30.447 --> 49:32.039
No, thanks. I'm trying to quit.

49:33.407 --> 49:36.160
All right. One hit.

49:50.847 --> 49:52.200
Merry Christmastime

50:05.767 --> 50:09.521
There's an expression
the Yanks use, "Go with the flow."

50:11.447 --> 50:13.756
So, yeah, I got a dose
of the holiday blues.

50:13.967 --> 50:18.995
But when a girl of this mind-blowing
calibre invites you to a party,

50:19.207 --> 50:22.756
it's time to get going
and start flowing.

50:25.567 --> 50:26.886
Maybe it's the late hour.

50:30.127 --> 50:32.846
Maybe it's the heavily
spiked eggnog.

50:36.007 --> 50:38.475
Maybe it was simply
a mutual desperate desire

50:38.687 --> 50:41.520
to have ourselves
a merry little Christmas.

50:42.127 --> 50:45.756
Whatever the reason, hooking up
has never gone more swimmingly,

50:45.967 --> 50:50.961
and I find myself saying
something highly out of character:

50:51.167 --> 50:55.240
I'm renovating my apartment
on the Upper West Side.

50:56.567 --> 50:58.876
But, say, you could...

50:59.087 --> 51:03.683
...crash at my sublet,
if you want.

51:04.607 --> 51:07.360
See you through the holidays.

51:07.967 --> 51:10.117
That sounds inviting.

51:16.967 --> 51:20.880
And so it came to pass,
that after all those years,

51:21.087 --> 51:25.444
little Alfred finally got
what he wanted for Christmas.

51:36.887 --> 51:39.560
The 12 days of Christmas
were flying by

51:39.767 --> 51:41.883
at a surrealistic pace.

51:43.447 --> 51:46.245
Yeah, it's been quite the ride.

51:50.287 --> 51:52.881
The package was irresistible.

51:53.167 --> 51:57.558
A showstopper with
a new-school brand of sexiness.

51:58.487 --> 52:01.206
Who wouldn't get off on the way
she makes heads turn?

52:02.327 --> 52:04.477
Plus, we have so much in common.

52:06.647 --> 52:10.481
- She's sweet, fun, original, exciting,
- Adore you.

52:10.687 --> 52:12.405
full of surprises.

52:12.647 --> 52:16.799
Oh, and did I mention,
she makes a cracking good bed.

52:19.247 --> 52:21.158
I began to wonder,

52:21.367 --> 52:22.880
could this be the one...

52:25.447 --> 52:28.041
...who finally holds my attention?

52:29.487 --> 52:31.523
Happy New Year!

52:44.607 --> 52:46.359
In every doomed relationship,

52:46.607 --> 52:48.802
there comes what I like to call

52:49.007 --> 52:52.716
"the uh-oh moment."

52:52.967 --> 52:54.446
When a certain little
something happens,

52:54.647 --> 52:57.400
and you know you've just witnessed
the beginning of the end.

52:58.207 --> 53:00.675
And suddenly you stop
and you think:

53:00.887 --> 53:04.641
"Uh-oh, iceberg ahead."

53:06.607 --> 53:09.405
With Nikki, that was
the first of many...

53:10.047 --> 53:12.117
...uh-oh moments.

53:12.687 --> 53:15.281
It began with petty arguments.

53:17.047 --> 53:20.801
Followed by random bouts
of melancholia.

53:21.447 --> 53:25.156
Major highs and manic lows.

53:25.767 --> 53:28.725
This girl never knows
when she's had one too many.

53:29.287 --> 53:34.042
And there had been constant displays
of erratic, reckless behaviour.

53:34.247 --> 53:38.001
And thank you, no.
No, I did not have insurance.

53:39.807 --> 53:44.483
But whenever I begin to feel
there's little reason to go on,

53:45.007 --> 53:49.478
I'm reminded that we still have
one very major thing in common.

53:50.327 --> 53:53.637
If only she didn't insist
on smoking before,

53:53.887 --> 53:55.798
after

53:56.487 --> 53:58.443
and during.

54:01.807 --> 54:04.162
What time are you gonna
be home, honey?

54:04.367 --> 54:05.766
Hear that?

54:05.967 --> 54:08.037
"What time are you gonna
be home, honey?"

54:08.607 --> 54:10.837
That's dangerously close
to wife-speak to me.

54:11.087 --> 54:13.999
Because I'm making something
really special for din-din.

54:14.687 --> 54:16.006
Din-din?

54:16.247 --> 54:17.566
I'll call later.

54:18.647 --> 54:23.437
Listen, are you sure you don't
think that colour's a little bit intense?

54:23.687 --> 54:27.885
- I think you're a little bit intense.
- Careful,

54:28.127 --> 54:30.357
because you've got paint
all over your hands.

54:32.087 --> 54:35.875
Plus, you're wearing my favourite shirt
to paint the house in, Nik. Don't...

54:39.527 --> 54:41.677
Sorry, baby.

54:44.407 --> 54:45.999
I gotta run.

54:46.247 --> 54:47.316
No, I've gotta run.

54:47.527 --> 54:51.486
I bet that I can make it
worth your while to stay.

54:52.607 --> 54:55.280
I'm sure you can. But you know what?
I've got that meeting.

54:55.847 --> 54:58.202
- Haven't I?
- Yeah.

55:05.607 --> 55:09.361
You know you're in trouble when
a sight like that can't keep you planted.

55:10.687 --> 55:13.884
When I was a boy
at St. Alban's Secondary School,

55:14.087 --> 55:16.521
the school took us
on this cultural trip

55:16.727 --> 55:18.638
to observe art at one of the...

55:19.007 --> 55:20.804
One of those big famous
London museums.

55:21.807 --> 55:22.922
Anyway, when I was there,

55:23.127 --> 55:26.483
I came across this statue
of a Greek goddess in marble.

55:26.687 --> 55:30.202
Aphrodi... Aphrodite,
something like that.

55:30.407 --> 55:32.762
Beautiful, she was.

55:33.687 --> 55:36.724
Perfect female form.

55:36.927 --> 55:38.679
Chiselled features.

55:38.887 --> 55:40.639
Exquisite.

55:41.887 --> 55:43.764
I stood in awe of her.

55:44.287 --> 55:47.006
Finally, the teacher calls us
all over, and I'm walking past it,

55:47.207 --> 55:51.280
and on the way I notice,
in the side of this Greek goddess,

55:51.487 --> 55:55.480
all these cracks,
chips, imperfections.

55:56.127 --> 55:57.685
Ruined her for me.

56:00.487 --> 56:02.318
Well, that's Nikki.

56:03.807 --> 56:06.321
A beautiful sculpture...

56:06.527 --> 56:08.119
...damaged...

56:08.327 --> 56:11.478
...in a way you don't notice
till you get too close.

56:21.087 --> 56:23.203
I lost the signal for a second there.

56:25.287 --> 56:26.845
But I don't know.

56:27.047 --> 56:29.515
It's just a lot of personal stuff
going on.

56:29.727 --> 56:31.080
You know what I mean?

56:35.807 --> 56:37.559
- Oh, I know.
- Welcome, Mr Alfie.

56:37.767 --> 56:40.361
Good to see you, Elvis. Look, I hope
you don't mind me rambling on.

56:40.527 --> 56:42.882
- Enjoy your evening, sir.
- Thank you.

56:45.607 --> 56:49.600
As you can see, the lad's
moving up in the world.

56:53.167 --> 56:55.920
It's just that I've got
this friend who's,

56:56.127 --> 56:59.676
let's say, outstayed his welcome.

57:02.767 --> 57:03.882
Absolutely right.

57:04.087 --> 57:07.841
It's a lot tougher getting them out
than getting them in. I like that.

57:08.047 --> 57:10.402
You'll never guess
who I'm dropping in on now.

57:10.607 --> 57:12.598
I wouldn't have believed it myself
a couple of weeks ago.

57:12.807 --> 57:14.763
Why don't you just try being honest,

57:14.967 --> 57:18.357
and tell your friend that the hotel
is under new management

57:18.567 --> 57:22.355
and that they have to vacate
the premises. You know what I mean.

57:22.567 --> 57:24.398
That kimono

57:24.607 --> 57:27.519
does wonders for your décolletage.

57:28.487 --> 57:31.604
- Big word.
- Big décolletage.

57:42.167 --> 57:44.965
Why don't we have a drink and you
can tell me the rest of your troubles.

57:45.167 --> 57:49.080
Instead of me listening to hers.
That's a change.

57:49.287 --> 57:53.041
You know, for someone
so very young, you're terribly wise.

57:54.967 --> 57:56.719
Secret admirer?

57:57.607 --> 57:59.757
One of many.

58:00.767 --> 58:03.565
You would never think of bringing
a girl flowers, would you, Alfie?

58:03.767 --> 58:05.803
It would only encourage them.

58:06.007 --> 58:07.804
I'm gonna make us that drink.

58:08.047 --> 58:09.480
What's your poison, sweetheart?

58:09.687 --> 58:13.566
I'll have a spot of whiskey, please.
Midleton Rare, if you've got it.

58:13.767 --> 58:15.803
I like dropping a fancy brand name
in now and again,

58:16.007 --> 58:17.599
let her know she ain't
the only one been around.

58:17.847 --> 58:21.840
Why not make this
an absinthe afternoon?

58:22.047 --> 58:23.719
Brilliant.

58:24.847 --> 58:28.362
- No idea what she's talking about.
- You've had absinthe?

58:28.607 --> 58:31.280
Not recently, no.
Remind me, what is it again?

58:31.487 --> 58:35.924
The Green Fairy. The French
impressionists' liquid drug of choice.

58:36.727 --> 58:40.845
And I got you some of those
little egg thingies you like so much.

58:48.327 --> 58:51.046
I mention I like something once,
next thing I know,

58:51.247 --> 58:52.885
I get it on a silver platter.

59:04.967 --> 59:06.764
Perfect, huh?

59:06.967 --> 59:09.242
Kind of pad I plan
to earn myself one day.

59:09.447 --> 59:12.996
Understated elegance
with just a touch of the trendy.

59:14.607 --> 59:16.837
She's a regular fashionista.

59:17.287 --> 59:20.484
You don't have to tell this one
which slingbacks go with which frock.

59:21.167 --> 59:23.123
Owns her own cosmetics company.

59:23.327 --> 59:25.682
Empire, actually.

59:25.887 --> 59:27.957
Started out doing facials
in a fancy salon.

59:28.167 --> 59:31.159
Took a handful of mud,
mixed it with a dash of papaya,

59:31.367 --> 59:34.677
put it on the market,
and bingo: All this.

59:34.887 --> 59:37.799
This stuff is so illegal.

59:38.647 --> 59:41.525
I smuggled a whole batch
of it back from Prague

59:41.767 --> 59:44.361
in Listerine bottles.

59:49.207 --> 59:51.960
Oh, I checked out
your business plan.

59:55.447 --> 59:58.166
- And?
- I'm impressed.

59:58.767 --> 01:00:00.678
- You seem surprised.
- Not at all.

01:00:00.927 --> 01:00:03.077
Because underneath
all that bravado

01:00:03.287 --> 01:00:05.881
beats the heart of a guy who's a lot
smarter than he thinks he is,

01:00:06.047 --> 01:00:10.677
but not nearly as cocky as he'd like
everybody else to believe.

01:00:16.087 --> 01:00:21.957
What are we...?
What exactly are we basing this on?

01:00:22.167 --> 01:00:25.682
This insight into my personality?

01:00:30.807 --> 01:00:33.765
That it takes one to know one.

01:00:50.127 --> 01:00:51.845
What?

01:00:52.927 --> 01:00:55.725
I was just wondering if there's
a clever little tattoo artist out there

01:00:55.927 --> 01:01:00.125
who could change "Pablo" into "Alfie."

01:01:05.767 --> 01:01:08.235
Here's to clever little tattoo artists.

01:01:19.527 --> 01:01:21.199
Jesus.

01:01:25.767 --> 01:01:28.759
It made me feel
all warm going down.

01:01:28.967 --> 01:01:31.117
That's my job.

01:01:39.447 --> 01:01:41.563
You know what they say.

01:01:43.247 --> 01:01:45.203
What do they say?

01:01:47.847 --> 01:01:51.203
Absinthe makes
the heart grow fonder.

01:01:56.127 --> 01:01:58.004
Oh, great.

01:02:04.047 --> 01:02:05.560
Check this out.

01:02:10.287 --> 01:02:12.482
Have a look at the size of this tub.

01:02:12.687 --> 01:02:14.917
She's had two husbands,
both croaked,

01:02:15.127 --> 01:02:17.880
and I have a feeling
this was the scene of the crime.

01:02:18.487 --> 01:02:20.796
Come on, baby, let's get wet.

01:02:28.167 --> 01:02:29.486
If she keeps this up,

01:02:29.687 --> 01:02:33.726
we're gonna be updating that tattoo
of hers a lot sooner than she thinks.

01:02:43.607 --> 01:02:47.759
Remember how little Alfred finally got
what he wanted for Christmas?

01:02:50.007 --> 01:02:52.760
Be careful what you wish for.

01:03:03.527 --> 01:03:05.597
There's something else.

01:03:17.087 --> 01:03:18.361
Dozed off?

01:03:20.487 --> 01:03:22.682
Yeah.

01:03:23.767 --> 01:03:26.122
I tried waiting up for you.

01:03:28.087 --> 01:03:31.875
- Your meeting ran late, huh?
- Very. I'm knackered.

01:03:32.087 --> 01:03:33.964
And wet.

01:03:35.047 --> 01:03:37.277
But...

01:03:37.487 --> 01:03:41.878
...I do want us to have
a little chat, Nikki.

01:03:44.127 --> 01:03:46.038
Okay.

01:03:46.247 --> 01:03:48.442
Sure.

01:03:48.647 --> 01:03:51.002
Why don't we talk over
a midnight snack.

01:03:51.207 --> 01:03:54.722
I made roast beef
and Yorkshire pudding.

01:03:55.287 --> 01:03:58.006
That was your favourite
as a young lad, right?

01:03:59.167 --> 01:04:01.920
And check the place out,
if you please.

01:04:02.847 --> 01:04:07.363
- Your little girl worked her fanny off.
- I noticed. It looks brilliant.

01:04:08.327 --> 01:04:10.079
Really smashing.

01:04:10.967 --> 01:04:13.879
- So, Nik...
- Alfie, I've been thinking.

01:04:15.047 --> 01:04:18.119
Will you look at these
cute little potatoes?

01:04:21.927 --> 01:04:26.284
Okay. I know I have been
a real handful lately.

01:04:27.447 --> 01:04:30.883
I don't know, I think it has to do a lot
with me feeling displaced...

01:04:32.767 --> 01:04:35.486
...and not totally trusting.

01:04:37.087 --> 01:04:39.601
Sweetie, cutting to the chase.

01:04:39.807 --> 01:04:43.004
I am gonna do better.

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:45.162
I promise.

01:04:45.847 --> 01:04:49.362
I am gonna take my medication
religiously from now on.

01:04:49.567 --> 01:04:53.560
And everything, everything
is gonna be easy and breezy.

01:04:53.807 --> 01:04:55.843
Sound good? Honey?

01:04:56.247 --> 01:04:59.080
So come, come and sit.
A feast awaits.

01:05:00.127 --> 01:05:01.924
I already ate, Nik.

01:05:03.207 --> 01:05:04.322
Of course.

01:05:04.527 --> 01:05:06.597
No worries, we'll have leftovers.

01:05:06.807 --> 01:05:11.164
I can whip up a little
corned beef hash for brunch.

01:05:18.167 --> 01:05:20.476
What's the matter, Alfie?

01:05:20.727 --> 01:05:22.843
Nothing. I just...

01:05:24.807 --> 01:05:26.957
I've got a lot on my mind and...

01:05:27.887 --> 01:05:30.037
...l'm feeling a bit...
- What?

01:05:31.487 --> 01:05:35.241
Cold? Distant? Remote? What?

01:05:36.207 --> 01:05:38.801
Oh, Nik, this is a complete drag.

01:05:39.647 --> 01:05:43.003
Everything happened so quickly.

01:05:44.367 --> 01:05:47.325
- I'm not the best at this sort of thing.
- What sort of thing?

01:05:49.527 --> 01:05:50.846
I...

01:05:51.327 --> 01:05:53.966
...don't know exactly how to say it.

01:05:54.887 --> 01:05:56.684
Sure you do, Alfie.

01:05:59.327 --> 01:06:03.036
You've had plenty
of experience dumping girls.

01:06:19.367 --> 01:06:21.119
Don't worry.

01:06:21.967 --> 01:06:24.765
I'm already gone.

01:07:20.207 --> 01:07:22.198
Strange.

01:07:22.407 --> 01:07:24.921
But even when you know
it has to end...

01:07:25.727 --> 01:07:27.797
...when it finally does...

01:07:28.687 --> 01:07:31.759
...you always get
that inevitable twinge:

01:07:32.527 --> 01:07:35.439
Have I done the right thing?

01:07:43.807 --> 01:07:46.321
I must admit...

01:07:46.527 --> 01:07:48.882
...I do miss the companionship.

01:07:52.007 --> 01:07:55.124
Nikki was a showstopper.

01:07:57.167 --> 01:08:01.206
But as me ugly old Aunt Gladys
used to say,

01:08:02.927 --> 01:08:04.280
"Looks aren't everything."

01:08:04.487 --> 01:08:06.284
I used to think that was
a load of bollocks,

01:08:07.487 --> 01:08:10.559
but just lately I've been thinking...

01:08:10.767 --> 01:08:13.361
...maybe the old bat had something.

01:08:53.727 --> 01:08:55.399
Julie?

01:08:56.527 --> 01:08:58.245
Alfie, hi.

01:08:58.487 --> 01:08:59.840
What a surprise.

01:09:00.367 --> 01:09:04.279
- God, I haven't seen you since...
- Yeah.

01:09:04.926 --> 01:09:06.997
You look... You look amazing.

01:09:07.207 --> 01:09:09.675
Thanks. You too.
You look good too.

01:09:10.807 --> 01:09:13.037
I'm getting over a cold.

01:09:13.287 --> 01:09:16.962
- But you're okay otherwise?
- I'm fine. I'm always fine.

01:09:19.807 --> 01:09:21.365
It's good to see you.

01:09:22.647 --> 01:09:24.205
And you.

01:09:29.647 --> 01:09:31.683
Hey, you know, I was...

01:09:33.567 --> 01:09:36.399
I'm sorry about
what happened between us.

01:09:37.207 --> 01:09:40.756
And I'm sorry how it all ended up.
It wasn't...

01:09:40.966 --> 01:09:43.322
It wasn't good.

01:09:46.727 --> 01:09:51.960
I felt bad about not seeing Max
and about not seeing you.

01:09:55.767 --> 01:09:58.804
- It's water under the bridge.
- Good.

01:10:01.567 --> 01:10:03.000
You know...

01:10:04.327 --> 01:10:05.806
...l'm wondering...

01:10:10.687 --> 01:10:12.757
Maybe we...

01:10:12.967 --> 01:10:16.039
You know I can never
promise anything.

01:10:16.927 --> 01:10:18.838
But if you want, if you like,

01:10:19.047 --> 01:10:20.400
maybe we could
see each other again.

01:10:20.847 --> 01:10:22.803
It would be okay by me.

01:10:23.007 --> 01:10:25.726
It would be more than okay,
it would be great.

01:10:25.927 --> 01:10:28.566
- Alfie, l...
- Yeah?

01:10:29.447 --> 01:10:31.677
This is Adam.

01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:36.638
Hey, how are you?

01:10:36.847 --> 01:10:38.519
- Hey, how you doing, Adam?
- Pretty good.

01:10:38.727 --> 01:10:40.399
- Adam.
- Yeah.

01:10:46.527 --> 01:10:48.438
It was great running into you.

01:10:50.447 --> 01:10:53.678
- You look fantastic.
- Thanks.

01:10:56.807 --> 01:10:59.002
What time is it? I've gotta go.

01:10:59.527 --> 01:11:01.961
I'm late for a meeting.
Nice to meet you, Adam.

01:11:12.607 --> 01:11:13.357
Julie?

01:11:13.407 --> 01:11:13.964
Julie?

01:11:16.007 --> 01:11:18.919
- How's Max?
- Oh, really good.

01:11:19.367 --> 01:11:21.562
Will you say hi?

01:11:21.767 --> 01:11:24.520
- Sure.
- Or not.

01:11:26.207 --> 01:11:27.959
Be well.

01:12:13.127 --> 01:12:14.719
Hello.

01:12:16.967 --> 01:12:19.003
Hello.

01:12:23.927 --> 01:12:26.566
Mrs Wing, is everything...?

01:12:26.767 --> 01:12:28.485
Wing.

01:12:30.767 --> 01:12:32.439
Why are you crying?

01:12:32.647 --> 01:12:34.239
I'm not crying. Get out.

01:12:34.967 --> 01:12:38.482
- You sure?
- I'm fine. Get out, Alfie.

01:12:38.727 --> 01:12:42.276
I'm sorry. I just wanted to see
if I could borrow a car.

01:12:42.487 --> 01:12:44.523
She leave me.

01:12:44.727 --> 01:12:46.683
Sorry?

01:12:46.887 --> 01:12:49.276
Blossom leave me.

01:12:49.487 --> 01:12:53.799
Blossom? Is that your wife's name,
Blossom?

01:12:54.007 --> 01:12:57.682
What I do wrong, Alfie? Love her?

01:12:59.407 --> 01:13:03.241
Look, mate. Come on,
you can win her back.

01:13:03.447 --> 01:13:05.563
Woo her. Send flowers
and chocolates.

01:13:05.767 --> 01:13:08.361
Write a poem.

01:13:08.527 --> 01:13:10.961
- That what you do?
- Well, actually, no, I've never done that,

01:13:11.167 --> 01:13:14.284
but it may be a way to go.

01:13:15.927 --> 01:13:17.963
What rhyme with Blossom?

01:13:20.127 --> 01:13:23.676
I would try "awesome."

01:13:27.447 --> 01:13:29.165
Okay.

01:14:25.487 --> 01:14:28.320
You never cease to amaze.

01:14:28.527 --> 01:14:30.643
Hey.

01:14:31.127 --> 01:14:34.039
Great to see you too, Lon.

01:14:34.807 --> 01:14:38.243
I guess I should have rung.
Hey, Sam.

01:14:38.447 --> 01:14:40.802
Well, that would have been a plan.

01:14:41.887 --> 01:14:44.560
Well, you know, I'm sorry,
it was just...

01:14:45.327 --> 01:14:47.238
It's nice.

01:14:55.607 --> 01:14:58.565
Look, Lonette...

01:15:00.167 --> 01:15:03.204
This is so uncomfortable, I know.
Because...

01:15:03.407 --> 01:15:06.479
You don't have to whisper.
Marlon's not here.

01:15:13.087 --> 01:15:14.486
I really miss you both.

01:15:14.847 --> 01:15:17.759
And I just wondered, maybe...

01:15:18.447 --> 01:15:20.517
Maybe me and you could put it
all behind us,

01:15:20.767 --> 01:15:24.680
pretend like it never happened,
and then move forward, you know?

01:15:25.527 --> 01:15:27.563
I just...

01:15:28.527 --> 01:15:31.121
You know, Alfie...

01:15:31.807 --> 01:15:33.798
...dropping by wasn't a good idea.

01:15:41.527 --> 01:15:43.563
You two didn't have a baby.

01:15:46.367 --> 01:15:48.437
You did have a baby.

01:15:49.367 --> 01:15:52.837
No, you were right the first time.

01:16:19.607 --> 01:16:23.441
Thinking back to that day at the clinic,
I remember

01:16:23.647 --> 01:16:26.241
trying to look in Lon's eyes to see
if I could even begin to understand

01:16:26.407 --> 01:16:31.276
what she was going through,
and how she wouldn't look at me.

01:16:31.887 --> 01:16:33.957
And I think I knew then.

01:16:34.207 --> 01:16:37.324
I just didn't want to admit it to myself.

01:16:39.447 --> 01:16:41.881
So classically...

01:16:43.367 --> 01:16:45.562
...I said nothing.

01:16:46.767 --> 01:16:49.486
I knew there was
a good chance the baby

01:16:49.727 --> 01:16:51.957
could be Marlon's.

01:16:54.847 --> 01:16:57.486
At least, I hoped.

01:16:58.807 --> 01:17:00.684
This is a lot...

01:17:03.047 --> 01:17:05.163
...for me too, Lon.

01:17:32.767 --> 01:17:34.962
Marlon stayed.

01:17:35.407 --> 01:17:36.999
For now.

01:17:45.207 --> 01:17:47.801
Is there anything I can do?

01:17:49.167 --> 01:17:51.681
What are you gonna do, Alfie?

01:18:31.767 --> 01:18:32.756
Hey.

01:18:38.567 --> 01:18:42.116
You know, I never...

01:18:42.687 --> 01:18:45.918
- I never meant...
- You never mean to hurt anybody.

01:18:50.167 --> 01:18:52.283
But you do, Alfie.

01:20:19.767 --> 01:20:22.406
I felt I needed a friend to talk to.

01:20:22.607 --> 01:20:25.997
Problem was, they were suddenly
in short supply.

01:20:26.207 --> 01:20:31.440
And I don't remember being in the car.
I just... I just... I was stopped.

01:20:31.647 --> 01:20:33.239
And I'm crying.

01:20:33.447 --> 01:20:37.804
- Crying for the little one?
- I don't know exactly.

01:20:38.607 --> 01:20:40.563
Maybe for him.

01:20:41.927 --> 01:20:44.122
Mostly, I think, for me.

01:20:46.007 --> 01:20:48.077
And Marlon.

01:20:49.487 --> 01:20:52.957
I never had anybody look at me
quite like that before.

01:20:54.927 --> 01:20:58.158
And believe me, I've had some looks
that could kill.

01:21:01.487 --> 01:21:05.878
He stood by Lonette.
I could've never, ever...

01:21:06.087 --> 01:21:09.397
You don't know what you'll do
till you really love someone.

01:21:12.607 --> 01:21:13.960
Well, now what?

01:21:15.327 --> 01:21:17.602
You gonna shoehorn yourself
into the situation?

01:21:17.807 --> 01:21:19.160
No.

01:21:19.367 --> 01:21:23.076
You did the only thing you could do.
You behaved like a gentleman.

01:21:23.327 --> 01:21:25.204
I've never been accused
of that before.

01:21:25.407 --> 01:21:28.763
Don't get all choked up. You also
behaved like a scheming,

01:21:28.967 --> 01:21:32.846
backstabbing, so-low-you-can-look-up-
a-snake's-asshole son of a bitch.

01:21:33.047 --> 01:21:36.562
Next time, think before unzipping.

01:21:38.487 --> 01:21:41.877
It's all right. You screwed up.

01:21:42.087 --> 01:21:44.237
So, what are you gonna do?

01:21:44.567 --> 01:21:46.876
Run to the bridge?

01:21:47.527 --> 01:21:49.677
The question is...

01:21:51.887 --> 01:21:55.118
...what's gonna happen with
the rest of your life?

01:22:21.047 --> 01:22:23.720
I'd be lying if I didn't admit the events
of the past few weeks

01:22:23.927 --> 01:22:26.521
have knocked me for a bit of a loop.

01:22:33.087 --> 01:22:35.806
All right, all right, all right.

01:22:45.967 --> 01:22:47.320
Hello, mate.

01:22:47.527 --> 01:22:49.040
And what can we do for you
this evening?

01:22:49.247 --> 01:22:50.999
- How much are one of those?
- Five-fifty.

01:22:51.207 --> 01:22:53.801
And you'll need to put them in water
immediately.

01:22:53.967 --> 01:22:56.037
Right, I'll have that.

01:23:00.887 --> 01:23:02.445
Second thought.

01:23:02.647 --> 01:23:04.922
Actually, this is
sort of a special thing.

01:23:05.367 --> 01:23:07.961
- What's the occasion?
- Say again?

01:23:08.207 --> 01:23:12.644
- Proposal?
- No. No, no.

01:23:13.767 --> 01:23:18.795
Well, I do want to extend an offer
to maybe have a go at it for a bit,

01:23:19.007 --> 01:23:20.804
give us a spin, that kind of thing.

01:23:21.007 --> 01:23:24.204
I get it. Commitment issues.

01:23:25.207 --> 01:23:28.404
Tell me what she, or he, is like,

01:23:28.607 --> 01:23:30.404
and we'll find the appropriate
bloom.

01:23:30.967 --> 01:23:34.039
Well, she is...

01:23:37.527 --> 01:23:41.156
You know what, she's adventurous.

01:23:42.727 --> 01:23:47.278
- Frivole.
- And very sexy.

01:23:47.847 --> 01:23:50.315
I'm thinking Dolce Vita.

01:23:50.527 --> 01:23:53.997
A little mischievous.
You know, cheeky?

01:23:54.247 --> 01:23:57.319
Avalanche, with a touch

01:23:57.727 --> 01:24:01.037
of mio amore.

01:24:01.927 --> 01:24:04.964
And then under it all, she's just...

01:24:05.167 --> 01:24:09.080
She's just kind of sweet.

01:24:32.687 --> 01:24:34.245
Liz?

01:24:34.447 --> 01:24:37.439
- Hello?
- It's me, my love.

01:24:39.207 --> 01:24:43.246
Hey, I didn't expect to see you tonight.
I thought you were working.

01:24:43.447 --> 01:24:46.086
I had a cancellation,
so I took the night off.

01:24:46.287 --> 01:24:48.755
Listen, I thought we should get
up early, get out of the city,

01:24:49.007 --> 01:24:51.043
go to the country
and see if we can stay

01:24:51.247 --> 01:24:53.841
- at that B & B you're always on about.
- I'd love to, but I can't.

01:24:54.007 --> 01:24:55.725
I have an investors' breakfast
in the morning.

01:24:55.927 --> 01:24:58.760
- How about on the weekend?
- Brilliant. Better.

01:24:58.967 --> 01:25:01.640
All right. I thought you may...

01:25:02.527 --> 01:25:05.246
Oh, my God.

01:25:06.007 --> 01:25:09.044
No. Alfie.

01:25:09.247 --> 01:25:13.525
- Oh, what a sweet gesture.
- Milady.

01:25:13.727 --> 01:25:17.845
They're not out of some plastic bucket.
I handpicked, like, every bud.

01:25:18.047 --> 01:25:20.686
- I can see that.
- And apparently, I have a bit of a flair

01:25:20.887 --> 01:25:22.479
for flower arranging.

01:25:23.167 --> 01:25:25.635
I'm impressed.

01:25:25.847 --> 01:25:28.441
- Talk about being blown away.
- Good. Mission accomplished.

01:25:31.047 --> 01:25:33.242
I like surprising you.

01:25:34.407 --> 01:25:36.477
Well, you certainly have done that.

01:25:37.887 --> 01:25:41.800
All right, then. Well, you're up early,
so I'm off.

01:25:42.047 --> 01:25:45.483
- I'm gonna see you tomorrow night?
- Yeah.

01:25:45.687 --> 01:25:48.360
When we speak,
there's some things...

01:25:48.567 --> 01:25:51.035
Some thing I really wanna
talk to you about.

01:25:51.247 --> 01:25:53.078
What, honey?

01:25:53.287 --> 01:25:57.758
I'm gonna wait for the exact perfect
moment, and that's all I'll say.

01:25:59.967 --> 01:26:01.685
I'll ring you in the morning.

01:26:01.927 --> 01:26:04.361
And, Alfie, thank you for the flowers.
They made my evening.

01:26:04.567 --> 01:26:06.046
Really?

01:26:08.047 --> 01:26:12.279
In that case, maybe I'll stay.

01:26:16.127 --> 01:26:17.719
I don't...

01:26:19.887 --> 01:26:22.037
No, it's not a good idea.

01:26:26.887 --> 01:26:28.923
There's a guy in there, isn't there?

01:26:32.767 --> 01:26:33.961
God...

01:26:42.527 --> 01:26:44.119
Go.

01:26:48.727 --> 01:26:50.399
Don't do this.

01:26:55.127 --> 01:26:56.321
What's he got?

01:26:58.287 --> 01:27:00.642
- Better than me?
- Alfie, please.

01:27:00.887 --> 01:27:03.117
Tell me. Please?

01:27:06.007 --> 01:27:10.046
Really, I would like to know.
What's he got? Tell me.

01:27:10.247 --> 01:27:14.160
I want to know what he's got.
Please tell me.

01:27:14.367 --> 01:27:17.962
Come on. Come on.
Come on, just tell me.

01:27:18.167 --> 01:27:20.044
Just tell me, come on.

01:27:21.927 --> 01:27:24.441
What's he got better than me?!

01:27:33.407 --> 01:27:35.602
He's younger than you.

01:28:02.287 --> 01:28:04.881
"He's younger than you."

01:28:06.367 --> 01:28:09.598
I've gotta admit,
I didn't see it coming.

01:28:11.207 --> 01:28:13.960
She caught me off-guard, all right.

01:28:15.767 --> 01:28:19.362
You couldn't tell, though, could you?

01:28:21.487 --> 01:28:27.164
As you've learned by now,
I'm rather skilled at hiding my feelings.

01:28:31.287 --> 01:28:33.164
You see, the thing with feelings
is they have

01:28:33.367 --> 01:28:38.122
this quiet way of sneaking up on you
when you least expect it.

01:28:40.087 --> 01:28:42.203
You know what I mean?

01:28:42.447 --> 01:28:44.358
Yeah.

01:28:45.647 --> 01:28:47.239
Like with Liz.

01:28:47.687 --> 01:28:51.600
Who would've thought,
of all the women I've known...

01:28:53.847 --> 01:28:57.476
...the one I let my guard down with
delivers the knockout punch.

01:29:00.287 --> 01:29:01.845
Ironic.

01:29:04.487 --> 01:29:06.796
Calendar word.

01:29:14.607 --> 01:29:16.120
Dorie.

01:29:20.087 --> 01:29:23.318
- Hi.
- Hello, Alfie.

01:29:24.847 --> 01:29:28.726
- I haven't seen you in ages.
- Maybe because you stopped calling.

01:29:29.767 --> 01:29:32.520
I know. Things were getting
a bit too...

01:29:32.727 --> 01:29:35.241
Don't bother explaining. I'm way past
needing excuses.

01:29:35.487 --> 01:29:39.162
All right. No, you know what?
I want to explain.

01:29:39.367 --> 01:29:41.597
What? You had your fill of me?

01:29:41.807 --> 01:29:44.719
Someone cuter came along?
I don't need to hear it, Alfie.

01:29:45.087 --> 01:29:46.236
- Look, Dorie...
- Really.

01:29:46.447 --> 01:29:47.766
Look, Dorie...

01:29:50.287 --> 01:29:51.845
What happens with me is...

01:29:52.847 --> 01:29:54.883
I don't know, I get...

01:29:55.087 --> 01:29:58.966
When it gets too... Not close
but something like that,

01:29:59.167 --> 01:30:04.116
I start to feel... Not stifled,

01:30:04.327 --> 01:30:07.922
not trapped, but something like that.

01:30:08.127 --> 01:30:10.766
And I... And...

01:30:11.887 --> 01:30:14.162
You know? You know what I mean?

01:30:17.527 --> 01:30:20.678
Did that make...?
Did that make any sense?

01:30:21.447 --> 01:30:25.042
I think it has to make sense to you
more than me at this point.

01:30:27.407 --> 01:30:29.238
Yeah, fair enough.

01:30:29.447 --> 01:30:32.280
I need to go. He'll be waiting for me.

01:30:32.487 --> 01:30:34.045
Dorie.

01:30:39.367 --> 01:30:40.959
I'm sorry.

01:30:56.527 --> 01:30:58.358
Good luck, Alfie.

01:31:14.207 --> 01:31:16.516
I warned them all from
the beginning.

01:31:16.727 --> 01:31:20.276
I always said something along
the lines of,

01:31:20.487 --> 01:31:22.364
"I must advise you,

01:31:22.567 --> 01:31:26.765
I am stamped with an
invisible warning.

01:31:26.967 --> 01:31:31.438
I will not commit. I will never marry."

01:31:37.807 --> 01:31:41.766
Despite my best efforts, I'm beginning
to feel some small cracks

01:31:41.967 --> 01:31:46.404
in my faux finish.

01:31:48.007 --> 01:31:51.079
You know, when I look back
on my little life,

01:31:51.287 --> 01:31:53.721
and all the women I've known...

01:31:55.487 --> 01:31:58.399
...I can't help but think about...

01:32:00.247 --> 01:32:03.000
...all that they've done for me...

01:32:03.727 --> 01:32:06.161
...and how little I've done for them.

01:32:06.367 --> 01:32:09.996
How they looked after me,
cared for me...

01:32:10.447 --> 01:32:13.757
...and I repaid them by never
returning the favour.

01:32:16.207 --> 01:32:17.925
Yeah.

01:32:18.127 --> 01:32:21.244
I used to think I had the best end
of the deal.

01:32:25.527 --> 01:32:27.563
What have I got?

01:32:27.767 --> 01:32:29.962
Really?

01:32:30.887 --> 01:32:33.401
Some money in my pocket.

01:32:33.887 --> 01:32:37.402
Some nice threads.
Fancy car at my disposal.

01:32:37.607 --> 01:32:39.882
And I'm single.

01:32:42.687 --> 01:32:46.362
Unattached. Free as a bird.

01:32:48.647 --> 01:32:50.922
I don't depend on nobody.

01:32:51.127 --> 01:32:53.243
Nobody depends on me.

01:32:54.367 --> 01:32:56.483
My life's my own.

01:33:02.447 --> 01:33:05.280
But I don't have peace of mind.

01:33:11.807 --> 01:33:14.685
And if you don't have that,
you've got nothing.

01:33:17.647 --> 01:33:19.046
So...

01:33:20.567 --> 01:33:23.877
So, what's the answer?
That's what I keep asking myself.

01:33:28.527 --> 01:33:30.677
What's it all about?

01:33:32.687 --> 01:33:34.757
You know what I mean?
