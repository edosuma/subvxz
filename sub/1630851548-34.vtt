09:24.866 --> 09:27.066
SEEM TO BE DOING SO WELL.

09:27.133 --> 09:29.433
THE STOCK MARKET, STILL THROUGH

09:29.500 --> 09:30.100
THE ROOF.

09:30.166 --> 09:32.600
UNEMPLOYMENT IS LESS THAN 5% TWO

09:32.666 --> 09:34.866
THEY USED TO SAY 5% WAS THE GOAL

09:34.933 --> 09:37.200
AND THIS IS AFTER A PANDEMIC.

09:37.266 --> 09:39.166
WHY ARE WE HAVING THIS

09:39.233 --> 09:39.866
SUPPLY-CHAIN PROBLEM?

09:39.933 --> 09:41.900
IF THOSE FACTORS ARE DOING WELL,

09:41.966 --> 09:45.000
WHY CAN'T WE GET STUFF OFF THE

09:45.066 --> 09:46.333
SHIPS?

09:46.400 --> 09:49.500
TRUCKING SHELVES EMPTY, --

09:49.566 --> 09:51.166
>> I HAVE INVESTMENTS IN OVER 30

09:51.233 --> 09:52.866
COMPANIES AND WE ARE HAVING

09:52.933 --> 09:54.533
MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THE SUPPLY

09:54.600 --> 09:55.400
CHAIN BECAUSE COUNTRIES THAT WE

09:55.466 --> 09:57.800
TOOK PRODUCT AND SERVICES FROM

09:57.866 --> 09:59.133
IN THE PAST HAVE NOT RECOVERED

09:59.200 --> 10:00.366
THE SAME WAY AMERICA HAS

10:00.433 --> 10:00.900
COMMITTED HAVE EVERYBODY

10:01.000 --> 10:02.566
VACCINATED AND THEY HAVE ALL

10:02.633 --> 10:03.333
KINDS OF ISSUES.

10:03.400 --> 10:06.400
THEY ARE KEEPING THEIR SUPPLY

10:06.466 --> 10:07.366
AND THEIR FACTORIES SHUT DOWN.

10:07.433 --> 10:08.933
IT'S HARD TO GET PARTS AND AS A

10:09.000 --> 10:11.966
RESULT, THAT'S HALF THE REASON

10:12.033 --> 10:12.366
WE HAVE INFLATION.

10:12.433 --> 10:14.400
REGARDING THE STOCK MARKET, YOU

10:14.466 --> 10:17.733
PRINT THREE AND A HALF TRILLION

10:17.800 --> 10:20.466
$3, PUT IT IN A HELICOPTER AND

10:20.533 --> 10:22.933
THROW IT IN THE COUNTRY, THE

10:23.000 --> 10:24.866
STOCK MARKET IS GOING TO GO UP.

10:24.933 --> 10:26.266
SO WAS THE WATCH MARKET, THE

10:26.333 --> 10:27.900
WINE MARKET, THE CAR MARKET,

10:27.966 --> 10:29.566
EVERYTHING THAT'S A HARD ASSET

10:29.633 --> 10:31.300
HAS EXPLODED TO THE UPSIDE

10:31.366 --> 10:32.400
BECAUSE MONEY IS FREE.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.966
>> Bill: NOT FOREVER.

10:35.033 --> 10:37.100
>> THERE IS 3 TRILLION COMING.

10:37.166 --> 10:39.066
>> Bill: I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG

10:39.133 --> 10:39.466
THE GOVERNMENT --

10:39.533 --> 10:41.533
>> WE HAVE NEVER PRINTED THIS

10:41.600 --> 10:42.633
MUCH MONEY BEFORE.

10:42.700 --> 10:44.700
>> Bill: TRUST ME, IT'S ON MY

10:44.766 --> 10:45.133
MIND.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.133
BUT WORKERS DEFINITELY DO HAVE

10:46.200 --> 10:47.966
MORE LEVERAGE THAN THEY EVER DID

10:48.033 --> 10:50.166
BEFORE, ISN'T THAT A GOOD THING?

10:50.233 --> 10:52.533
WE'VE HEARD THIS WORD

10:52.600 --> 10:53.133
"UNDERCLASS" FOR A LONG TIME

10:53.200 --> 10:54.933
BECAUSE IT'S A REAL THING IN

10:55.000 --> 10:55.366
AMERICA.

10:55.433 --> 10:56.233
PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST LIVING

10:56.300 --> 10:56.533
DAY-TO-DAY.

10:56.600 --> 11:01.500
I WAS LI READING ABOUT TRUCKERSE

11:01.566 --> 11:02.100
CAN'T GET TRUCKERS ONE OF THE

11:02.166 --> 11:04.333
REASONS WE HAVE SUPPLY CHAIN

11:04.400 --> 11:05.966
ISSUES AND IT'S A HORRIBLE JOB,

11:06.033 --> 11:06.433
IT'S A HORRIBLE LIFE.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.000
YOU HAVE NO LIFE.

11:09.066 --> 11:10.500
YOU MUST AGREE THERE IS SOME

11:10.566 --> 11:12.700
PROBLEM IN AMERICA WHERE WE HAVE

11:12.766 --> 11:14.366
THIS KIND OF INCOME INEQUALITY

11:14.433 --> 11:15.966
WHERE SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST

11:16.033 --> 11:17.000
UNUNDERCLASS AND WASN'T IT A

11:17.066 --> 11:17.933
GOOD THING THAT NOW THEY HAVE A

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
LITTLE LEVERAGE?

11:20.066 --> 11:22.766
>> IT IS A GOOD THING BUT LET ME

11:22.833 --> 11:24.600
TELL YOU, THE ECONOMY HAS DONE

11:24.666 --> 11:26.666
SUCH A REMARKABLE CHANGE IN THE

11:26.733 --> 11:28.300
LAST 24 MONTHS THAT PEOPLE WHO

11:28.366 --> 11:28.900
USED TO BE CONSIDERED STARVING

11:28.966 --> 11:32.966
ARTISTS FOR EXAMPLE, LET'S TALK

11:33.033 --> 11:34.866
ABOUT VIDEOGRAPHERS

11:34.933 --> 11:35.833
PHOTOGRAPHERS, ANIMATORS, THAT

11:35.900 --> 11:37.333
MADE NOTHING PREPANDEMIC ARE NOW

11:37.400 --> 11:38.300
THE MOST SOUGHT AFTER

11:38.366 --> 11:39.733
INDIVIDUALS AS THE ENTIRE

11:39.800 --> 11:40.733
ECONOMY HAS GONE DIGITAL.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.733
EVERYONE WANTS TO SELL DIRECT TO

11:43.800 --> 11:44.866
CONSUMER, NIKE SELLS PRODUCTS

11:44.933 --> 11:47.566
DIRECT TO CONSUMER, IT NEEDS

11:47.633 --> 11:48.166
PHOTOGRAPHY, ANIMATION,

11:48.233 --> 11:49.000
GRAPHICS, THESE PEOPLE DON'T

11:49.066 --> 11:50.600
WANT TO WORK ANYMORE IN A

11:50.666 --> 11:50.833
CUBICLE.

11:50.900 --> 11:51.800
IN FACT THEY DON'T WANT TO WORK

11:51.866 --> 11:53.200
AT ALL, THEY WANT TO BE

11:53.266 --> 11:55.066
CONTRACTORS FOR POLICE TO MAKE

11:55.133 --> 11:57.933
30,000, NOTHING MAKE 150,000.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.533
I THINK THE ECONOMY IS DOING

11:59.600 --> 12:00.733
REALLY WELL AND A HUGE

12:00.800 --> 12:01.500
TRANSITION IS OCCURRING.

12:01.566 --> 12:03.266
IT'S DOING WHAT IT DOES.

12:03.333 --> 12:04.933
THE MARKET ALWAYS TAKES CARE OF

12:05.000 --> 12:05.166
ITSELF.

12:05.233 --> 12:06.600
>> Bill: I GUESS IT'S DOING

12:06.666 --> 12:09.133
WELL FOR ANIMATORS, IS THAT

12:09.200 --> 12:11.166
REALLY THE TYPICAL WORKER, AND

12:11.233 --> 12:13.633
ANIMATOR?

12:13.700 --> 12:13.900
[LAUGHTER]

12:13.966 --> 12:14.500
[APPLAUSE]

12:14.566 --> 12:19.933
>> THINK ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.766
I REMEMBER WHEN I TALK TO

12:21.833 --> 12:23.100
STUDENTS AND I TEACH A LITTLE

12:23.166 --> 12:24.866
BIT NOW, I ALWAYS SAY THERE'S

12:24.933 --> 12:25.933
THREE PROFESSIONS YOU NEED AND

12:26.000 --> 12:27.366
IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO COLLEGE

12:27.433 --> 12:29.666
AND GET YOURSELF $100,000 IN

12:29.733 --> 12:32.133
DEBT, MAKE SURE YOU'RE AN

12:32.200 --> 12:33.100
ENGINEER, AN ENGINEER, OR AN

12:33.166 --> 12:35.066
ENGINEER, AND AT NIGHT TAKE SOME

12:35.133 --> 12:36.366
ENGINEERING CLASSES, EVERYTHING

12:36.433 --> 12:36.933
ELSE IS WORTHLESS.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.900
I DON'T FEEL THAT WAY ANYMORE.

12:38.966 --> 12:43.400
RIGHT NOW, I CAN'T HIRE PEOPLE

12:43.466 --> 12:45.133
OUT OF ANY COLLEGE THAT'S AN ART

12:45.200 --> 12:46.666
COLLEGE TO WORK FOR ME IN

12:46.733 --> 12:47.866
CREATING CONTENT FOR

12:47.933 --> 12:49.066
SOCIAL MEDIA THAT HELPS SELL

12:49.133 --> 12:49.333
PRODUCTS.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.600
IT'S A REMARKABLE CHANGE.

12:51.666 --> 12:53.766
>> Bill: I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU

12:53.833 --> 12:54.366
CAN'T GET A LOT OF PEOPLE COME

12:54.433 --> 12:56.900
BACK TO THE OFFICE, YOU THOUGHT

12:56.966 --> 12:58.766
IT WOULD BE LIKE 15% THAT

12:58.833 --> 12:59.500
WOULDN'T COME BACK AFTER THE

12:59.566 --> 13:01.700
PANDEMIC BUT IT'S REALLY

13:01.766 --> 13:03.133
SOMETHING LIKE 55% WHO SAY THEY

13:03.200 --> 13:04.533
WILL NEVER COME BACK TO?

13:04.600 --> 13:06.900
>> THEY ARE NEVER COMING BACK.

13:06.966 --> 13:07.700
>> Bill: DOESN'T THAT TELL YOU

13:07.766 --> 13:11.166
SOMETHING ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY

13:11.233 --> 13:12.000
MUST HAVE FUCKING HEAD AT THE

OFFICE BEGIN WITH?

13:15.400 --> 13:15.966
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

13:16.033 --> 13:17.400
I'M JUST ASKING, I MISS MY

13:17.466 --> 13:17.733
OFFICE.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.300
>> THEY HAVE PROVEN TO EVERYBODY

13:20.366 --> 13:21.066
ALL AROUND THE WORLD THEY CAN

13:21.133 --> 13:23.900
USE TECHNOLOGY TO DO THEIR JOB

13:23.966 --> 13:24.900
SUCCESSFULLY, CREATIVELY,

13:24.966 --> 13:25.900
FUNCTIONALLY, THEY WANT TO STAY

13:25.966 --> 13:28.400
AT HOME, RAISE THEIR KIDS, TAKE

13:28.466 --> 13:29.366
CARE OF THEIR ELDERLY PARENTS.

13:29.433 --> 13:30.800
IF YOU SAY TO THEM YOU HAVE TO

13:30.866 --> 13:32.666
COME BACK TO THE OFFICE, THAT'S

13:32.733 --> 13:33.933
OUR NEW MANDATE, THEY WILL SAY I

13:34.000 --> 13:35.700
JUST WANT TO QUIT AND WORK

13:35.766 --> 13:36.366
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

13:36.433 --> 13:38.766
WE THOUGHT IT WAS 15%, WE HAVE A

13:38.833 --> 13:40.433
SAMPLE SIZE OF 10,000 PEOPLE IN

13:40.500 --> 13:42.766
OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, I THOUGHT IT

13:42.833 --> 13:44.933
WOULD BE ACCOUNTING, LOGISTICS,

13:45.000 --> 13:46.933
COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENTS, IT'S

13:47.000 --> 13:47.200
EVERYBODY.

13:47.266 --> 13:48.100
THEY DON'T WANT TO COME BACK.

13:48.166 --> 13:50.433
WE HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE THIS

13:50.500 --> 13:52.500
WAY AND I'M OKAY WITH IT, IT

13:52.566 --> 13:53.500
WORKS.

13:53.566 --> 13:54.900
I FIND IT REALLY INTERESTING.

13:55.000 --> 13:55.933
>> Bill: SO YOU'RE OKAY WITH

13:56.000 --> 13:56.100
IT.

14:04.133 --> 14:06.800
UP ON A FARM, I'M GOING BACK TO

THE FARM.

14:07.133 --> 14:09.166
I'M GOING TO LIVE ON THE FARM.

14:09.233 --> 14:10.766
I'LL WORK FOR YOU BUT IT'S GOING

14:10.833 --> 14:13.066
TO BE FROM THE FARM.

14:13.133 --> 14:15.166
I SAID "COOL, I'M OKAY WITH

14:15.233 --> 14:17.133
THAT, NO PROBLEM."

>> Bill: WHO WANTS TO LIVE ON

14:18.766 --> 14:19.300
A FARM?

IN ABOUT A YEAR, BEGGING TO BE

14:24.466 --> 14:27.600
BACK TO THE OFFICE.

14:27.666 --> 14:29.100
LET'S GET BACK TO INCOME

14:29.166 --> 14:30.300
INEQUALITY FOR A MINUTE.

14:30.366 --> 14:31.633
I FEEL LIKE WE ARE HAVING A

14:31.700 --> 14:34.800
DEBATE AMONG PEOPLE LIKE YOU WHO

14:34.866 --> 14:39.166
BELIEVE IN CAPITALISM, THERE IS

14:39.233 --> 14:41.333
NO DOUBT CAPITALISM HAS LIFTED

14:41.400 --> 14:41.933
MORE PEOPLE OUT OF MISERY AND

14:42.000 --> 14:44.933
POVERTY THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.866
>> MANY IDEAS HAVE BEEN TRIED

14:46.933 --> 14:47.666
AND THEY HAVEN'T WORKED.

14:47.733 --> 14:49.833
>> Bill: WE TRIED THE OTHER

14:49.900 --> 14:51.133
ONES BY THIS POINT.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.333
THE YOUNGER GENERATION ARE LIKE

14:52.400 --> 14:53.633
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN IF I WASN'T

14:53.700 --> 14:56.333
ALIVE FOR IT, YET, IT KIND OF

14:56.400 --> 14:57.133
DID.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.033
STUFF HAPPENS, THE WORLD DID TRY

14:59.100 --> 15:01.233
COMMUNISM FOR ABOUT 70 YEARS AND

15:01.300 --> 15:03.100
IT SUCKED.

15:03.166 --> 15:05.133
WE SEEM TO BE HAVING AN ARGUMENT

15:05.200 --> 15:07.366
NOW OVER HOW RICH IS TOO RICH?

15:07.433 --> 15:10.866
IS THERE AN UPPER STRATA?

15:10.933 --> 15:14.133
ELON MUSK PASSED THE 300 BILLION

15:14.200 --> 15:15.133
MARK.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.866
TO YOUR POINT IS ALWAYS SOMEONE

15:17.933 --> 15:18.900
RICHER, YES, BUT THAT MUCH

15:18.966 --> 15:20.900
RICHER AND WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT

CHANGED EVERYBODY'S LIVES IN

ELECTRIC CARS, CHANGING THE

15:29.366 --> 15:29.900
ECONOMY, MAKING IT GREENER,

15:29.966 --> 15:32.600
SHOULD WE PUNISH THEM FOR THAT

WAS MIKE IS HE A BAD GUY?

15:36.000 --> 15:40.300
DID HE NOT JUST PAY $5 BILLION

MANY MORE TIMES THAT WOULD BE

16:14.766 --> 16:16.766
THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON MAKES

16:23.466 --> 16:24.733
COUNTRY OF ENGLAND THEY SAID HOW

16:24.800 --> 16:25.733
MUCH IS TOO MUCH?

16:25.800 --> 16:27.433
RICH PEOPLE SHOULD GIVE BACK

16:27.500 --> 16:27.666
MONEY.

16:27.733 --> 16:28.866
WE SHOULD TAKE MORE MONEY FROM

THEM.

16:29.133 --> 16:31.466
THEY GOT IN A BOAT AND THEY CAME

16:31.533 --> 16:33.433
TO AMERICA AND THEY MADE THIS

THE NUMBER ONE ECONOMY ON EARTH.

16:37.766 --> 16:38.700
SHALL BE REVERSE IT NOW, SHOULD

16:38.766 --> 16:40.666

24:26.200 --> 24:28.133
REPUBLICANS WOULD FALL IN LINE

24:28.200 --> 24:29.800
WITH WHAT HE WANTED AND DO HIS

24:29.866 --> 24:31.500
BIDDING AND THEY DIDN'T.

24:31.566 --> 24:33.666
SOME HAD INTEGRITY AND WHAT HE'S

24:33.733 --> 24:35.966
BEEN DOING SINCE IS REPLACING

24:36.033 --> 24:37.933
THOSE PEOPLE.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.900
AS A PURGE GOING ON BEHIND THE

24:39.966 --> 24:40.266
SCENES.

24:40.333 --> 24:41.666
NEXT TIME WHEN HE CALLS THEM UP

24:41.733 --> 24:45.066
AND SAYS "I HOPE YOU CAN FIND ME

24:45.133 --> 24:46.700
A FEW VOTES" THEY ARE GOING TO

24:46.766 --> 24:47.400
SAY HOW MANY?

24:47.466 --> 24:49.066
HE'S GOING TO HAVE HIS STOOGES

24:49.133 --> 24:50.466
IN PLACE, THAT'S WHAT YOU WROTE

24:50.533 --> 24:52.200
ME ABOUT, A LOT OF PEOPLE DID.

24:52.266 --> 24:53.766
I THINK IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN,

24:53.833 --> 24:55.500
THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO LOSE

24:55.566 --> 24:58.433
BIG IN 2022 WHICH IS GOING TO

24:58.500 --> 24:59.566
MAKE IT WORSE.

24:59.633 --> 25:01.733
MORE STATE LEGISLATURES THAT CAN

25:01.800 --> 25:02.866
DO THAT BEHIND-THE-SCENES TO PUT

25:02.933 --> 25:04.000
THE PEOPLE IN PLACE WILL DO

25:04.066 --> 25:06.700
TRUMPS BIDDING.

25:06.766 --> 25:08.466
I THINK HE'S GOING TO DECLARE

25:08.533 --> 25:09.766
FOR OFFICE, HE'S GOING TO GET

25:09.833 --> 25:11.033
THE NOMINATION, I THINK THE

25:11.100 --> 25:13.700
RALLIES ARE GOING TO START, IT'S

25:13.766 --> 25:15.233
GOING TO GET THE VERY VIOLENT

25:15.300 --> 25:15.666
OUT THERE.

25:15.733 --> 25:17.300
MY QUESTION IS, WHAT ARE WE

25:17.366 --> 25:20.433
DOING ABOUT THE NEXT TIME?

25:20.500 --> 25:22.633
THE ELECTION HAPPENS, SAY TRUMP

25:22.700 --> 25:23.866
LOSES, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER

25:23.933 --> 25:26.666
HE LOSES, HE'S GOING TO SAY HE

25:26.733 --> 25:27.633
WON.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.066
WE KNOW THAT, THERE IS NO DOUBT

25:29.133 --> 25:31.666
HE'S GOING TO SAY I WON AND THIS

25:31.733 --> 25:34.633
TIME HE'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY

25:34.700 --> 25:37.666
SO EASILY COME JANUARY 20TH

25:37.733 --> 25:37.866
2025.

25:37.933 --> 25:41.133
WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT THAT

25:41.200 --> 25:42.533
WHEN HE IS INSISTING HE IS THE

25:42.600 --> 25:44.100
PRESIDENT WHETHER HE WON OR NOT

25:44.166 --> 25:44.666
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE

25:44.733 --> 25:48.500
HELPING HIM WITH IT?

25:48.566 --> 25:48.766
[APPLAUSE]

25:48.833 --> 25:53.466
I'M IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT WITH

25:53.533 --> 25:55.000
THE ALARM THAT YOU EXPRESS AND

25:55.066 --> 25:56.033
YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I

25:56.100 --> 25:57.400
THINK WHAT DONALD TRUMP TOOK

25:57.466 --> 25:59.266
AWAY FROM THE FAILED

25:59.333 --> 26:01.233
INSURRECTION IS THAT IF HE

26:01.300 --> 26:04.633
COULDN'T FIND 11,000 VOTES IN

26:04.700 --> 26:05.833
GEORGIA, COULDN'T FIND A CORRUPT

26:05.900 --> 26:07.233
ELECTIONS OFFICIAL TO GIVE HIM

26:07.300 --> 26:08.666
THOSE VOTES, HE'S DETERMINED THE

26:08.733 --> 26:09.566
NEXT TIME HE WILL HAVE SOMEONE

26:09.633 --> 26:13.533
IN THE POSITION WHO WILL.

26:13.600 --> 26:15.033
IT'S A TWO PRONGED STRATEGY,

26:15.100 --> 26:16.266
THEY ARE TRYING TO

26:16.333 --> 26:16.900
DISENFRANCHISE PEOPLE OF COLOR

26:16.966 --> 26:19.333
ON THE COUNTRY SO THEY CAN WIN

26:19.400 --> 26:21.200
AND IF THEY LOSE, THEY WANT TO

26:21.266 --> 26:23.700
IN A POSITION TO OVERTURN THE

26:23.766 --> 26:24.900
RESULT.

26:24.966 --> 26:27.466
WHERE I WOULD DISAGREE WITH YOUR

26:27.533 --> 26:28.100
FORECAST, I HOPE AND PRAY -- WE

26:28.166 --> 26:31.433
CANNOT LOSE THE HOUSE.

26:31.500 --> 26:33.066
WE MUST HOLD THE HOUSE.

26:33.133 --> 26:34.666
IF KEN McCARTHY HAD BEEN

26:34.733 --> 26:36.666
SPEAKER IN 2020 AND WE HAD LOST

26:36.733 --> 26:38.166
A FEW MORE SEATS IN THE 2020

26:38.233 --> 26:39.666
ELECTION IN THE HOUSE, HE

26:39.733 --> 26:40.633
WOULD'VE OVERTURNED THE RESULT

26:40.700 --> 26:41.700
IN THE HOUSE.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.166
HE WILL DO WHATEVER DONALD TRUMP

26:43.233 --> 26:44.933
TELLS THEM TO DO.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.233
SOMEONE LIKE THAT CAN NEVER BE

26:46.300 --> 26:48.433
ALLOWED TO GO NEAR THE SPEAKER'S

26:48.500 --> 26:49.733
OFFICE.

26:49.800 --> 26:53.433
[APPLAUSE]

26:53.500 --> 26:55.166
STEP ONE, I THINK, HAS TO BE

26:55.233 --> 26:58.266
HOLDING THE HOUSE.

26:58.333 --> 26:59.500
STEP TWO, GOD FORBID WE LOSE THE

26:59.566 --> 27:02.266
HOUSE, WE NEED TO BE FIGHTING

27:02.333 --> 27:03.466
THESE EFFORTS AROUND THE COUNTRY

27:03.533 --> 27:04.000
TODAY.

27:04.066 --> 27:05.633
NOT A YEAR FROM NOW, NOT TWO

27:05.700 --> 27:09.033
YEARS FROM NOW, WE HAVE TO BE

27:09.100 --> 27:10.466
DEFENDING THESE MERITOCRATIC,

27:10.533 --> 27:11.100
TECHNOCRATIC ELECTIONS OFFICIALS

27:11.166 --> 27:12.033
WERE BEING THE SUBJECT OF DEATH

27:12.100 --> 27:15.066
THREATS RIGHT NOW.

27:15.133 --> 27:15.833
>> Bill: LET ME GIVE YOU SOME

27:15.900 --> 27:20.700
BAD NEWS ABOUT YOUR

27:20.766 --> 27:21.066
PROGNOSTICATION.

27:21.133 --> 27:22.333
>> MORE BAD NEWS?

27:22.400 --> 27:23.600
>> Bill: WE HAD SOME GOOD NEWS

27:23.666 --> 27:27.000
TODAY -- IN 2010, AFTER OBAMA

27:27.066 --> 27:29.933
PASSED HIS STIMULUS PLAN AND THE

27:30.000 --> 27:30.800
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, DEMOCRATS

27:30.866 --> 27:34.633
LOST 63 SEATS IN THE HOUSE.

27:34.700 --> 27:37.366
THIS IS THE REWARD YOU GET FOR

27:37.433 --> 27:38.000
PASSING PROGRESSIVE LEGISLATION.

27:38.066 --> 27:40.700
I'M JUST SAYING THIS ON THE EVE

27:40.766 --> 27:42.633
OF WHEN YOU'RE PASSING THIS

27:42.700 --> 27:43.833
BACON PER STRUCTURE BILL.

27:43.900 --> 27:45.266
LYNDON JOHNSON'S GREAT SOCIETY

27:45.333 --> 27:53.066
CONGRESS LOST 47 SEATS.

27:53.133 --> 27:53.700
FDR'S NEW DEAL CONGRESS LOST 72

27:53.766 --> 27:54.266
SEATS, WE CAN TALK ALL NIGHT

27:54.333 --> 27:54.933
ABOUT WHY THIS IS, I'M JUST

27:55.000 --> 27:57.766
SAYING THIS IS WHAT DID HAPPEN.

27:57.833 --> 28:00.833
ON THE SURVEY OF THREAT TO

28:00.900 --> 28:03.666
DEMOCRACY -- 81% OF AMERICANS

28:03.733 --> 28:05.000
BELIEVE THERE IS A SERIOUS

28:05.066 --> 28:06.066
THREAT TO DEMOCRACY.

28:06.133 --> 28:06.633
WHICH PARTY REPRESENTS THE

28:06.700 --> 28:07.566
BIGGER THREAT?

28:07.633 --> 28:12.800
YOU WIN, DEMOCRATS 42-41%.

28:12.866 --> 28:15.533
TELL ME WHY YOU'RE OPTIMISTIC

28:15.600 --> 28:17.066
ABOUT 2022?

28:17.133 --> 28:18.833
>> SOME OF THOSE HISTORIC

28:18.900 --> 28:20.633
PRECEDENTS THAT YOU MENTIONED

28:20.700 --> 28:21.766
WERE ELECTIONS LIKE

28:21.833 --> 28:22.600
BARACK OBAMA'S ELECTION IN WHICH

28:22.666 --> 28:27.633
WHEN HE ORIGINALLY TOOK OFFICE,

28:27.700 --> 28:28.900
HE SWEPT INTO OFFICE ALONG WITH

28:28.966 --> 28:30.233
HIM A LARGE NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS

28:30.300 --> 28:30.966
IN DISTRICTS THAT WOULD BE VERY

28:31.033 --> 28:33.100
HARD TO HOLD.

28:33.166 --> 28:35.066
TWO YEARS LATER THERE WAS AT

28:35.133 --> 28:35.633
CORRECTION AND DEMOCRATS IN

28:35.700 --> 28:38.333
THOSE DISTRICTS WERE WIPED OUT.

28:38.400 --> 28:41.300
BARACK OBAMA ALSO DIDN'T GO OUT

28:41.366 --> 28:42.433
AND SELL THE AFFORDABLE CARE

28:42.500 --> 28:42.600
ACT.

28:42.666 --> 28:44.500
HE FELT THE JOB WAS DONE.

28:44.566 --> 28:46.400
>> Bill: AND BIDEN IS DOING

28:46.466 --> 28:47.100
THAT WITH INFRASTRUCTURE.

28:47.166 --> 28:49.066
>> HE'S GOING TO DO THAT WITH

28:49.133 --> 28:52.066
BUILD BACK BETTER.

28:52.133 --> 28:52.833
WOULD BIDEN WAS ELECTED, HE

28:52.900 --> 28:54.766
DIDN'T HAVE COATTAILS.

28:54.833 --> 28:56.866
>> Bill: LET ME GET BACK TO

28:56.933 --> 28:57.733
THE QUESTION.

28:57.800 --> 29:00.666
WHAT DO WE DO BETWEEN

29:00.733 --> 29:05.800
ELECTION DAY 2024 AND

29:05.866 --> 29:10.066
JANUARY 20TH 2025, WHEN TRUMP --

29:10.133 --> 29:11.933
HE STILL HASN'T CONCEDED THE

29:12.000 --> 29:12.200
SELECTION?

29:12.266 --> 29:13.200
WHAT DO WE DO?

29:13.266 --> 29:14.433
>> I'LL GIVE YOU THREE ANSWERS,

29:14.500 --> 29:17.766
I DON'T THINK IT'S A QUESTION OF

29:17.833 --> 29:20.066
EITHER/OR, I THINK IT HAS TO BE

29:20.133 --> 29:20.633
BOTH/AND.

29:20.700 --> 29:22.800
WE NEED TO FOCUS ON JANUARY 6TH,

29:22.866 --> 29:24.233
WHICH WAS THE PAST BUT I THINK

29:24.300 --> 29:25.000
YOU COULD DO BOTH.

29:25.066 --> 29:26.833
WE CAN'T LET THEM GET AWAY WITH

29:26.900 --> 29:28.033
THAT, YOU HAVE TO HOLD SOMEBODY

29:28.100 --> 29:28.800
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT.

29:28.866 --> 29:31.066
AT THE SAME TIME YOU NEED TO

29:31.133 --> 29:32.433
FOCUS ON JANUARY 6TH 2025, I'M

29:32.500 --> 29:34.133
ALL FOR THAT.

29:34.200 --> 29:35.433
THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS I THINK

29:35.500 --> 29:36.633
WE CAN DO.

29:36.700 --> 29:38.500
THERE'S A REASON WHY PEOPLE

29:38.566 --> 29:39.366
ACROSS THE COUNTRY FROM

29:39.433 --> 29:41.133
CALIFORNIA TO THE CAROLINAS WHO

29:41.200 --> 29:42.533
ARE FIGHTING AGAINST THIS KIND

29:42.600 --> 29:43.866
OF VOTER SUPPRESSION.

29:43.933 --> 29:45.566
PEOPLE FIGHTING EVERY SINGLE DAY

29:45.633 --> 29:47.066
FOR VOTING RIGHTS -- IT'S A SAD

29:47.133 --> 29:48.266
STATE OF AFFAIRS AS I THINK THE

29:48.333 --> 29:48.933
CONGRESSMAN WOULD AGREE THAT WE

29:49.000 --> 29:50.766
CAN'T GET ANY MEANING FULL

29:50.833 --> 29:53.533
VOTING RIGHTS LEGISLATION PASSED

29:53.600 --> 29:54.833
IN THE CONGRESS.

29:54.900 --> 29:56.566
TWO MAJOR BILLS INTRODUCED,

29:56.633 --> 29:57.766
NEITHER ONE COULD GET THROUGH.

29:57.833 --> 29:59.433
I UNDERSTAND IN THE SENATE WE

29:59.500 --> 30:00.833
HAVE THIS 50/50 SPLIT,

30:00.900 --> 30:03.066
EVERYTHING IS HELD UP BECAUSE OF

30:03.133 --> 30:05.066
THESE TWO SENATORS WHO SHALL

30:05.133 --> 30:06.533
REMAIN NAMELESS -- JOE MANCHIN

30:06.600 --> 30:10.866
AND KYRSTEN SINEMA -- BUT IT'S

30:10.933 --> 30:11.800
TRAGIC WE COULDN'T GET

30:11.866 --> 30:13.100
MEANINGFUL VOTING RIGHTS

30:13.166 --> 30:16.466
LEGISLATION THROUGH.

30:16.533 --> 30:18.066
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL

30:18.133 --> 30:20.033
AMERICANS REGARDLESS OF RACE,

30:20.100 --> 30:21.033
COLOR, OR CREED TO UNDERSTAND

30:21.100 --> 30:22.766
THIS IS NOT A FIGHT THAT JUST

30:22.833 --> 30:24.000
BLACK FOLK ARE WAGING, WE ARE

30:24.066 --> 30:26.366
THE ONLY ONES WHO LOSE WHEN

30:26.433 --> 30:27.600
VOTER SUPPRESSION SUCCEEDS.

30:27.666 --> 30:28.766
FOR THOSE PEOPLE AROUND THE

30:28.833 --> 30:29.666
COUNTRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS

30:29.733 --> 30:31.200
FIGHT IS ALL ABOUT, THEY HAVE TO

30:31.266 --> 30:32.233
JOIN IN AND UNDERSTAND THE RIGHT

30:32.300 --> 30:33.400
TO VOTE IS THE MOST PRECIOUS

30:33.466 --> 30:37.166
RIGHT THAT WE HAVE AND AS WE

30:37.233 --> 30:37.500
FIGHT --

30:37.566 --> 30:39.466
>> Bill: THE VOTING DOESN'T

30:39.533 --> 30:39.900
MATTER.

30:39.966 --> 30:40.766
>> IT DOES MATTER.

30:40.833 --> 30:42.533
>> Bill: I DON'T THINK IT

30:42.600 --> 30:43.433
DOES, NOT WITH PEOPLE WHO DON'T

30:43.500 --> 30:48.100
RECOGNIZE THE TALLY, IT DOESN'T

30:48.166 --> 30:49.500
MATTER, YOU CAN WIN BY A ZILLION

30:49.566 --> 30:51.900
VOTES, IF THEY ARE OUT THERE THE

30:51.966 --> 30:54.400
NEXT DAY, THREE QUARTERS OF THE

30:54.466 --> 30:55.566
REPUBLICAN PARTY DOESN'T BELIEVE

30:55.633 --> 30:57.600
TRUMP LOST THE LAST ELECTION.

30:57.666 --> 30:59.700
>> LET ME ADD THIS, I'M SORRY TO

30:59.766 --> 31:01.600
SAY THIS CONGRESSMAN, BUT LET ME

31:01.666 --> 31:02.666
INVITE THE DEMOCRATS IN THIS

31:02.733 --> 31:03.033
REGARD.

31:03.100 --> 31:05.200
IT SEEMS TO ME THE DEMOCRATS ARE

31:05.266 --> 31:07.933
FOCUSED ON A NATIONAL STRATEGY,

31:08.000 --> 31:09.366
SO FOCUSED ON CONGRESS, THAT'S

31:09.433 --> 31:09.633
IMPORTANT.

31:09.700 --> 31:11.800
GOT TO HOLD THE HOUSE AND

31:11.866 --> 31:13.800
ADVANCE THE SENATE TO THE EXTENT

31:13.866 --> 31:15.800
THAT YOU CAN, I HEAR BILLS

31:15.866 --> 31:17.633
PROGNOSTICATION BUT WELL

31:17.700 --> 31:19.466
DEMOCRATS FOCUS ON THE NATIONAL

31:19.533 --> 31:20.166
LEVEL, THESE REPUBLICANS ARE

31:20.233 --> 31:21.433
DOING EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING

31:21.500 --> 31:21.633
ABOUT.

31:21.700 --> 31:23.433
THEY ARE FOCUSED AT THE LOCAL

31:23.500 --> 31:25.066
LEVEL CHANGING ALL OF THESE

31:25.133 --> 31:25.966
ELECTION LAWS, I THINK IT WAS

31:26.033 --> 31:27.933
TIP O'NEILL WHO SAID ALL

31:28.000 --> 31:30.600
POLITICS IS LOCAL.

31:30.666 --> 31:32.300
WE ARE NOT FOCUSING WHERE WE

31:32.366 --> 31:33.033
NEED TO BE FOCUSING AND THAT IS

31:33.100 --> 31:35.833
THE PROBLEM.

31:35.900 --> 31:36.300
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

31:36.366 --> 31:38.033
>> Bill: IF I CAN TURN TO THE

31:38.100 --> 31:40.200
ECONOMY FOR ONE SECOND, I WAS

31:40.266 --> 31:41.700
TALKING TO KEVIN THERE ABOUT THE

31:41.766 --> 31:43.066
SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES, I'VE BEEN

31:43.133 --> 31:44.066
IN THE STORE LATELY, I MUST TELL

31:44.133 --> 31:46.300
YOU SOME OF THE PEOPLE --

31:46.366 --> 31:49.233
>> HOLD ON, YOU WANT TO THE

31:49.300 --> 31:50.100
STORE?

31:50.166 --> 31:51.633
>> Bill: AND I WAS MASKED WHEN

31:51.700 --> 31:54.233
I DID, SO DON'T TRY TO GET ME ON

31:54.300 --> 31:54.700
THAT ONE.

31:54.766 --> 31:55.833
SOME OF THE THINGS THEY WERE

33:08.633 --> 33:11.933

33:30.300 --> 33:31.866
AFTER I DID THAT PIECE, PEOPLE

33:31.933 --> 33:35.033
WERE ASKING ME WHAT DO WE DO?

33:35.100 --> 33:38.633
SHORT RANGE I CAN'T TELL YOU,

33:38.700 --> 33:40.466
THAT'S ABOVE MY PAY GRADE.

33:40.533 --> 33:42.233
LONG-RANGE, WE HAVE TO REDUCE

33:42.300 --> 33:42.766
THE HATE.

33:42.833 --> 33:45.400
I'M GOING TO BE IN NEW YORK

33:45.466 --> 33:46.366
TOMORROW NIGHT.

33:46.433 --> 33:49.266
FOR THE NEXT NIGHT SUNDAY I'M IN

33:49.333 --> 33:50.033
HERSHEY, PENNSYLVANIA, WHENEVER

33:50.100 --> 33:51.400
I GO TO A LOCAL CITY I ALWAYS

33:51.466 --> 33:52.333
READ UP ON LOCAL POLITICIANS SO

33:52.400 --> 33:55.233
I CAN MAKE FUN OF THEM.

33:55.300 --> 33:57.700
SO I'M READING UP, SCOTT PERRY,

33:57.766 --> 33:58.466
YOU KNOW THIS GUY?

33:58.533 --> 34:01.066
YOU MUST WORK WITH HIM, HE'S A

34:01.133 --> 34:01.600
REPRESENTATIVE FROM THIS

34:01.666 --> 34:02.733
DISTRICT, HERE'S WHAT HE SAID A

34:02.800 --> 34:05.433
FEW MONTHS AGO ABOUT YOU, THE

34:05.500 --> 34:05.833
DEMOCRATS.

34:05.900 --> 34:08.500
"THEY ARE NOT THE LOYAL

34:08.566 --> 34:08.800
OPPOSITION.

34:08.866 --> 34:09.700
THEY ARE THE OPPOSITION TO

34:09.766 --> 34:10.800
EVERYTHING YOU LOVE AND BELIEVE

34:10.866 --> 34:14.366
IN, GO FIGHT THEM.

34:14.433 --> 34:15.033
."

34:15.100 --> 34:17.233
I READ THIS NOT BECAUSE IT'S

34:17.300 --> 34:18.033
REMARKABLE BECAUSE IT'S TYPICAL,

34:18.100 --> 34:19.033
THIS IS THE RHETORIC -- WE NEVER

34:19.100 --> 34:21.266
USED TO DO THIS.

34:21.333 --> 34:22.366
PARTIES WERE AT EACH OTHERS

34:22.433 --> 34:23.666
THROATS TO A DEGREE BUT THEY

34:23.733 --> 34:24.766
NEVER SAID THEY ARE THE

34:24.833 --> 34:26.400
OPPOSITION TO EVERYTHING YOU

34:26.466 --> 34:27.600
LOVE AND BELIEVE IN.

34:27.666 --> 34:29.700
THIS WAS MY FOLLOW-UP TO THIS,

34:29.766 --> 34:31.233
WE HAVE TO STOP THIS LEVEL OF

34:31.300 --> 34:33.133
HATE BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT THE

34:33.200 --> 34:35.300
ISSUES ARE, YOU CAN PASS ALL THE

34:35.366 --> 34:37.133
INFRASTRUCTURE BILLS -- WHY WAS

34:37.200 --> 34:37.900
THAT INFRASTRUCTURE BILL MET

34:37.966 --> 34:42.333
WITH DEATH THREATS?

34:42.400 --> 34:43.633
THE MOST BORING, SHOULD BE

34:43.700 --> 34:44.900
BIPARTISAN THAN THE WORLD, EVEN

34:44.966 --> 34:47.833
IF YOU ARE NOT FOR IT, DEATH

34:47.900 --> 34:48.600
THREATS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE?

34:48.666 --> 34:49.466
DOESN'T THAT TELL YOU SOMETHING

34:49.533 --> 34:53.300
ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IN THIS

34:53.366 --> 34:55.833
COUNTRY?

34:55.900 --> 34:59.766
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

34:59.833 --> 35:01.500
NOT THAT I'M SAYING IT'S YOUR

35:01.566 --> 35:02.633
FAULT BUT AFTER 9/11 WE ALWAYS

35:02.700 --> 35:08.000
ASK WHY DO THEY HATE US?

35:08.066 --> 35:09.633
>> AS SOMEONE WHO HAS RECEIVED

35:09.700 --> 35:11.300
MORE THAN THEIR SHARE OF DEATH

35:11.366 --> 35:13.700
THREATS --

35:13.766 --> 35:15.766
>> Bill: ME OR YOU?

35:15.833 --> 35:17.300
[LAUGHTER]

35:17.366 --> 35:22.633
>> BOTH OF US, WE'LL HAVE TO

35:22.700 --> 35:23.500
SWAP DETAILS.

35:23.566 --> 35:24.133
YOU MENTIONED THE INFRASTRUCTURE

35:24.200 --> 35:27.433
BILL AND HOW VOTING FOR AN

35:27.500 --> 35:28.966
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL COULD BE

35:29.033 --> 35:30.033
CONSIDERED A DEATH SENTENCE OR

35:30.100 --> 35:33.333
DEATH THREAT WORTHY ACT.

35:33.400 --> 35:34.566
IN THE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE

35:34.633 --> 35:37.666
RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE DISCUSSING

35:37.733 --> 35:39.366
WHETHER TO STRIP REPUBLICANS OF

35:39.433 --> 35:40.833
THEIR COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS FOR

35:40.900 --> 35:41.733
VOTING FOR AN INFRASTRUCTURE

35:41.800 --> 35:42.166
BILL, A BIPARTISAN

35:42.233 --> 35:44.200
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL.

35:44.266 --> 35:46.700
>> Bill: AND CALLING THEM

35:46.766 --> 35:46.966
TRAITORS.

35:47.033 --> 35:48.600
>> CONVERSELY WHEN ONE OF THEIR

35:48.666 --> 35:50.766
MEMBERS PUTS OUT A VIDEO

35:50.833 --> 35:51.866
GLORIFYING VIOLENCE AGAINST A

35:51.933 --> 35:54.466
FELLOW MEMBER OF CONGRESS,

35:54.533 --> 35:54.766
THAT'S OKAY.

35:54.833 --> 35:57.933
BUT INFRASTRUCTURE IS A CARDINAL

35:58.000 --> 35:58.166
SIN.

35:58.233 --> 35:58.733
THAT'S WHERE DONALD TRUMP'S

35:58.800 --> 36:03.333
REPUBLICAN PARTY IS RIGHT NOW.

36:03.400 --> 36:06.833
THE TRUMP G.O.P. HAS BECOME AN

36:06.900 --> 36:09.466
ANTIDEMOCRATIC, AUTOCRATIC,

36:09.533 --> 36:10.400
ANTI-TRUTH PARTY, A CULT AROUND

36:10.466 --> 36:13.000
THE FORMER PRESIDENT.

36:13.066 --> 36:15.300
IT IS NO EXAGGERATION TO SAY THE

36:15.366 --> 36:17.466
OCCUPANT OF THAT OFFICE HAS THE

36:17.533 --> 36:19.033
BIGGEST MEGAPHONE AND HE USED IT

36:19.100 --> 36:22.066
TO BITTERLY DIVIDE THE COUNTRY.

36:22.133 --> 36:22.600
>> Bill: WHY IS THERE THIS

36:22.666 --> 36:26.000
HATE TO BEGIN WITH?

36:26.066 --> 36:27.833
>> IT GETS BACK TO THE

36:27.900 --> 36:28.800
CONVERSATION YOU WERE HAVING

36:28.866 --> 36:30.133
EARLIER.

36:30.200 --> 36:30.700
OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES

36:30.766 --> 36:33.666
THERE HAS BEEN A MASSIVE CHANGE

36:33.733 --> 36:38.200
IN OUR ECONOMY, GLOBALIZATION,

36:38.266 --> 36:39.066
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF

36:39.133 --> 36:39.733
AMERICANS ARE AT RISK OF LOSING

36:39.800 --> 36:43.133
EVERYTHING THEY HAVE AND THAT IS

36:43.200 --> 36:47.333
A BREEDING GROUND FOR THE RISE

36:47.400 --> 36:48.433
OF A DEMAGOGUE.

36:48.500 --> 36:49.266
IT'S NOT SO MUCH WHEN PEOPLE

36:49.333 --> 36:52.466
HAVE NOTHING THEY FEEL LIKE A

36:52.533 --> 36:53.233
REVOLUTION, IT'S WHEN THEY HAVE

36:53.300 --> 36:54.966
SOMETHING THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT

36:55.033 --> 36:55.766
LOSING.

36:55.833 --> 36:57.733
HE PLAYED UPON THAT VERY

36:57.800 --> 37:00.266
SKILLFULLY, HE USED IT TO PIT

37:00.333 --> 37:00.966
AMERICANS AGAINST OTHER

37:01.033 --> 37:01.600
AMERICANS AND USED IT TO SUGGEST

37:01.666 --> 37:03.733
THE REASON MY PEOPLE WERE

37:03.800 --> 37:05.866
SUFFERING WAS BECAUSE OF THOSE

37:05.933 --> 37:06.766
WHO DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THEM, THAT

37:06.833 --> 37:11.766
IS VERY POTENT.

37:11.833 --> 37:12.633
DONALD TRUMP PROFITED FROM THAT

37:12.700 --> 37:14.166
ECONOMIC ANXIETY WHICH IS TRUE

37:14.233 --> 37:15.366
HERE AND AROUND THE WORLD.

37:15.433 --> 37:17.800
IT'S WHY YOU AUTOCRATS RISING

37:17.866 --> 37:18.833
AROUND THE WORLD.

37:18.900 --> 37:20.300
HIM >> LET ME OFFER AN ANSWER --

37:20.366 --> 37:21.800
I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU JUST

37:21.866 --> 37:23.233
SAID BUT LET ME OFFER AN ANSWER

37:23.300 --> 37:24.433
THAT I THINK IS MORE SIMPLISTIC

37:24.500 --> 37:25.766
BUT I THINK IT'S THE ANSWER

37:25.833 --> 37:27.900
HERE.

37:27.966 --> 37:28.800
WHY?

37:28.866 --> 37:30.566
YOU ASKED THIS QUESTION, BECAUSE

37:30.633 --> 37:31.300
PEOPLE IN THIS MOMENT ARE

37:31.366 --> 37:35.233
DETERMINED TO WIN BY ANY MEANS

37:35.300 --> 37:35.966
NECESSARY.

37:36.033 --> 37:36.633
THAT'S THE ANSWER.

37:36.700 --> 37:37.733
PEOPLE WILL DO WHATEVER THEY

37:37.800 --> 37:39.700
HAVE TO DO TO WIN, THEY WILL DO

37:39.766 --> 37:42.433
WHATEVER THEY HAVE TO DO TO

37:42.500 --> 37:42.800
SUCCEED.

37:42.866 --> 37:44.200
INSTABILITY IN OUR SOCIETY HAS

37:44.266 --> 37:45.900
RUN AMOK BUT WE ARE ALL, WE MAY

37:45.966 --> 37:48.233
OR MAY NOT AGREE ON THIS, BUT WE

37:48.300 --> 37:49.600
ARE ALL COMPLICIT IN THIS.

37:49.666 --> 37:53.033
I THINK POLITICIANS ARE

37:53.100 --> 37:54.366
COMPLICIT BECAUSE THEY ENGAGE

37:54.433 --> 37:55.266
THIS BEHAVIOR, DONALD TRUMP AND

37:55.333 --> 37:56.533
OTHERS -- SHE'S NOT THE ONLY

37:56.600 --> 37:57.466
ONE.

37:57.533 --> 37:59.266
I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE

37:59.333 --> 37:59.966
COMPLICIT BECAUSE WE IGNORE WHEN

38:00.033 --> 38:01.666
THEY DO IT AND VOTE FOR THEM

38:01.733 --> 38:03.533
ANYWAY AND I THINK THE

38:03.600 --> 38:05.833
MAINSTREAM MEDIA FRANKLY IS

38:05.900 --> 38:06.466
COMPLICIT.

38:06.533 --> 38:07.833
I WAS IN A CONVERSATION THE

38:07.900 --> 38:09.300
OTHER DAY WHERE SOMEBODY SAID

38:09.366 --> 38:11.133
THE MEDIA BUILDS PEOPLE UP TO

38:11.200 --> 38:13.766
TEAR THEM DOWN.

38:13.833 --> 38:15.766
I SAID THEY BUILD YOU UP TO TEAR

38:15.833 --> 38:16.833
YOU DOWN -- I SAID THEY DON'T

38:16.900 --> 38:18.433
BUILD YOU UP AND TEAR YOU DOWN,

38:18.500 --> 38:20.633
THEY BUILD YOU UP TO TEAR YOU

38:20.700 --> 38:22.166
DOWN, GET THE CONJUNCTION RIGHT.

38:22.233 --> 38:24.100
THEY MAKE MONEY COMING AND THEY

38:24.166 --> 38:25.066
MAKE MONEY GOING.

38:25.133 --> 38:27.066
THEY MADE MONEY WHEN THEY BUILT

38:27.133 --> 38:28.266
DONALD TRUMP UP AND THEY MADE

38:28.333 --> 38:29.066
MONEY WHEN THEY TURNED ON

38:29.133 --> 38:31.166
DONALD TRUMP BUT ALL OF THIS ARE

38:31.233 --> 38:31.833
COMPLICIT IN THIS INCIVILITY,

38:31.900 --> 38:32.800
ALL OF US.

38:32.866 --> 38:34.366
[APPLAUSE]

38:34.433 --> 38:39.900
>> Bill: SOME MORE THAN OTHERS

38:39.966 --> 38:40.566
OTHERS.

38:40.633 --> 38:43.633
I HAVE POLICY ISSUES WITH AOC

38:43.700 --> 38:44.566
BUT THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN

38:44.633 --> 38:48.766
WHO PUT OUT A CARTOON OF HIM IN

38:48.833 --> 38:52.366
SOME ANIME CUTTING HER HEAD

38:52.433 --> 38:56.233
OFF -- THIS CHANT OF "LET'S GO

38:56.300 --> 38:57.900
BRANDON" WHICH IS THEIR FUNNY

38:57.966 --> 39:00.500
WAY OF SAYING "FUCK JOE BIDEN."

39:00.566 --> 39:04.566
IN THE PAST SAID FUCK TRUMP,

39:04.633 --> 39:06.466
ROBERT DE NIRO SAID IT, HE'S NOT

39:06.533 --> 39:07.400
IN CONGRESS.

39:07.466 --> 39:08.966
THEY ARE PEOPLE IN CONGRESS

39:09.033 --> 39:13.233
DOING THIS, PEOPLE YOU WORK WIT

39:13.300 --> 39:13.900
WITH.

39:13.966 --> 39:15.000
I'M JUST SAYING I DON'T THINK

39:15.066 --> 39:17.766
YOU CAN HAVE THIS LEVEL OF HATE

39:17.833 --> 39:20.166
AND LEAVE IT AND IT'S NOT GOING

39:20.233 --> 39:23.233
TO STAY AT A NONVIOLENT LEVEL.

39:23.300 --> 39:24.033
I MENTIONED IN THE MONOLOGUE,

39:24.100 --> 39:27.533
THERE ARE TWO VERY RACIALLY

39:27.600 --> 39:29.533
CHARGED TRIALS GOING ON RIGHT

39:29.600 --> 39:31.900
NOW, ONE SEEMS PRETTY CUT AND

39:31.966 --> 39:34.866
DRIED, AHMAUD ARBERY, HE'S AN

39:34.933 --> 39:36.166
UNARMED BLACK MEN KILLED ON

39:36.233 --> 39:37.566
FEBRUARY 23RD 2024 SUSPICIOUS

39:37.633 --> 39:43.600
RUNNING, I THINK FROM TWO WHITE

39:43.666 --> 39:45.800
GUYS IN A PICKUP TRUCK WITH A

39:45.866 --> 39:48.033
CONFEDERATE VANITY PLATE.

39:48.100 --> 39:49.266
BIDEN TWEETED HE WAS KILLED IN

39:49.333 --> 39:50.666
COLD BLOOD TO.

39:50.733 --> 39:51.266
I WANT TO SAY PRESIDENTS NEVER

39:51.333 --> 39:56.800
USED TO TALK LIKE THAT, LET'S

39:56.866 --> 39:57.333
RECOGNIZE LITTLE PROGRESS.

39:57.400 --> 39:59.333
THAT'S SOMETHING.

39:59.400 --> 40:02.933
ONE BLACK JUROR ON THIS TRIAL

40:03.033 --> 40:06.666
BECAUSE THE DEFENSE REMOVED

40:06.733 --> 40:07.300
BLACK JURORS AND THE PROSECUTION

40:07.366 --> 40:09.433
REMOVED ALL THE WHITE JURORS.

40:09.500 --> 40:12.800
IF THERE'S AN ACQUITTAL -- THEN

40:12.866 --> 40:13.466
THERE'S THE KYLE RITTENHOUSE

40:13.533 --> 40:14.733
CASE, THE KID WHO WATCHED TOO

40:14.800 --> 40:15.800
MANY COMIC BOOK MOVIES AND

40:15.866 --> 40:17.466
THOUGHT HE COULD BE A HERO AND

40:17.533 --> 40:19.100
THE SAVE KENOSHA WHILE HE WAS

40:19.166 --> 40:20.866
LIVING IN ILLINOIS AND WENT TO

40:20.933 --> 40:21.833
WAR FOR FREEDOM OR A CAR

40:21.900 --> 40:24.800
DEALERSHIP OR SOMETHING, I DON'T

40:24.866 --> 40:25.900
KNOW.

40:25.966 --> 40:28.400
EITHER ONE OF THESE TRIALS, I

40:28.466 --> 40:30.800
COULD SEE -- WARS START WITH

40:30.866 --> 40:32.000
TENDER BOXES WITH SPARK PLUGS

40:32.066 --> 40:33.966
WITH JUST A LITTLE MATCH THROWN

40:34.033 --> 40:34.733
ON SOMETHING.

40:34.800 --> 40:37.100
IT'S ALWAYS A SMALL INCIDENT AND

40:37.166 --> 40:38.000
IT BECOMES SOMETHING BIG AND I

40:38.066 --> 40:39.600
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THESE BUT

40:39.666 --> 40:43.200
THIS IS WHAT I WORRY ABOUT AND

40:43.266 --> 40:45.066
AGAIN UNTIL YOU WALK BACK AT

40:45.133 --> 40:47.266
THIS LEVEL OF HATE THAT WE HAVE

40:47.333 --> 40:49.600
FOR EACH OTHER, A STARTLING

40:49.666 --> 40:50.433
NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY

40:50.500 --> 40:52.833
WANT TO SUCCEED, WHATEVER THAT

40:52.900 --> 40:53.833
WOULD MEAN -- HOW WOULD WE

40:53.900 --> 40:58.366
SUCCEED IN CALIFORNIA WITH JUST

40:58.433 --> 40:59.133
4 MILLION TRUMP VOTERS?

40:59.200 --> 41:01.433
WHAT WE DO ABOUT THIS HATE?

41:01.500 --> 41:07.000
>> DR. KING ONCE SAID FAMOUSLY

41:07.066 --> 41:07.933
YOU CANNOT LEGISLATE MORALITY,

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
YOU CANNOT LEGISLATE PEOPLE'S

41:10.066 --> 41:12.000
BEHAVIORS BUT THERE ARE THINGS

41:12.066 --> 41:12.800
YOU CAN DO WITH SPECIFIC REGARD

41:12.866 --> 41:20.033
TO THE AMO THE DASH THURGOOD MAL

41:20.100 --> 41:23.033
SAID IN THE CASE OF BATSON

41:23.100 --> 41:25.200
VERSUS KENTUCKY, THE ONLY WAY TO

41:25.266 --> 41:26.800
GET RID OF RACISM IN JURY

41:26.866 --> 41:31.400
SELECTION IS TO DO AWAY WITH

41:31.466 --> 41:35.900
THESE CHALLENGES, PERIOD.

41:35.966 --> 41:36.466
I THINK JUSTICE MARSHALL WAS

41:36.533 --> 41:39.166
RIGHT ABOUT THIS, WE HAVEN'T

41:39.233 --> 41:40.100
TAKEN IT SERIOUSLY.

41:40.166 --> 41:40.933
YOU HAVE TO DO AWAY WITH THE

41:41.000 --> 41:44.466
CAPACITY PEOPLE HAVE TWO STRIKE

41:44.533 --> 41:45.800
PEOPLE FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS

41:45.866 --> 41:46.866
THAT THEY MAKE UP BUT WE KNOW

41:46.933 --> 41:48.833
WHAT THEY ARE REALLY DOING.

41:48.900 --> 41:51.566
YOU GOT TO GET RID OF THESE

41:51.633 --> 41:52.233
PREEMPTORY CHALLENGES.

41:52.300 --> 41:53.966
WORD THAT NOT THE CASE WE WANT

41:54.033 --> 41:56.200
TO HAVE 11 BLACK POTENTIAL

41:56.266 --> 41:57.400
JURORS BE STRICKEN FROM THE

41:57.466 --> 41:59.566
POSSIBILITY OF SERVING ON THAT

41:59.633 --> 42:00.466
JURY.

42:00.533 --> 42:01.466
>> Bill: THE PROSECUTION TO

42:01.533 --> 42:03.600
THE REVERSE, THIS IS WHAT I

42:03.666 --> 42:05.166
WORRY ABOUT.

42:05.233 --> 42:07.266
THAT A CIVIL WAR BECOMES A RACE

42:07.333 --> 42:09.033
WAR.

42:09.100 --> 42:11.633
>> CAN I JUST MENTION -- AND I

42:11.700 --> 42:13.900
AGREE, THE TWO THINGS THAT WORRY

42:13.966 --> 42:15.566
ME THE MOST THAT I'VE SEEN IN

42:15.633 --> 42:17.166
THESE TRIALS ARE THE DECISION TO

42:17.233 --> 42:20.966
USE PREEMPTORY TO STRIKE LACK

42:21.033 --> 42:24.800
JURORS AND IN THAT BATSON'S

42:24.866 --> 42:25.566
CASE, JUSTICE BRENNAN SAID YOU

42:25.633 --> 42:29.066
DON'T NEED TO GIVE A REASON

42:29.133 --> 42:30.700
FOR -- IT'S REALLY HIDING

42:30.766 --> 42:31.666
RACISM, THE TEST I DON'T THINK

42:31.733 --> 42:32.366
HAS WORKED AND I THINK WE SHOULD

42:32.433 --> 42:35.600
GET RID OF IT.

42:35.666 --> 42:39.300
THE OTHER ISSUE IN THE

42:39.366 --> 42:39.966
RITTENHOUSE CASE WAS A DECISION

42:40.033 --> 42:43.133
BY THE JUDGE TO SAY YOU CAN'T

42:43.200 --> 42:43.733
CALL THESE VICTIMS VICTIMS BUT

42:43.800 --> 42:47.433
YOU CAN CALL THEM WRITERS,

42:47.500 --> 42:52.200
ARSONISTS, LOOTERS.

42:52.266 --> 42:55.000
THOSE TWO FACTORS, TO ME AS A

42:55.066 --> 42:55.633
FORMER PROSECUTOR, A DECISION I

42:55.700 --> 42:58.700
FIND VERY HARD TO RECONCILE

42:58.766 --> 42:59.866
ABOUT WHY ONE SIDE CAN CALL THEM

42:59.933 --> 43:02.200
WHAT THEY WANT TO THE OTHER SIDE

43:02.266 --> 43:05.566
CAN'T IN THE STRIKING OF LACK

43:05.633 --> 43:07.400
JURORS, I THINK IT BREEDS PUBLIC

43:07.466 --> 43:08.366
DISTRUST ABOUT WHETHER YOU'RE

43:08.433 --> 43:10.466
GOING TO GET A JUST RESULT IN

43:10.533 --> 43:11.766
EACH CASE.

43:11.833 --> 43:14.033
YOU LAYER ON THAT THESE

43:14.100 --> 43:16.233
INCREDIBLE TENSIONS AMONG

43:16.300 --> 43:23.433
AMERICANS AND ITS EXPLOSIVE.

43:23.500 --> 43:24.133
AMONG THE GRAVEST THREATS TO OUR

43:24.200 --> 43:24.766
COUNTRY IN ONE OF THE REASONS I

43:24.833 --> 43:27.633
AGREE WITH YOU THAT JANUARY 6TH

43:27.700 --> 43:28.233
WORK IS SO IMPORTANT, THE BIG

43:28.300 --> 43:30.400
LIE THEY ARE PUSHING ABOUT THE

43:30.466 --> 43:31.933
ELECTION ISN'T JUST A LIE ABOUT

43:32.000 --> 43:32.833
THE ELECTION, IT'S AN ARGUMENT

43:32.900 --> 43:36.633
WE CAN'T TRUST THE ELECTIONS TO

43:36.700 --> 43:38.166
DECIDE WHO CAN GOVERN ANYMORE,

43:38.233 --> 43:40.000
THAT'S REALLY AT THE HEART OF

43:40.066 --> 43:40.166
IT.

43:40.233 --> 43:43.666
>> ON THESE PREEMPTORY

43:43.733 --> 43:44.900
CHALLENGES, IT'S IMPORTANT TO

43:44.966 --> 43:48.733
UNDERSTAND CONSTITUTIONAL.

43:48.800 --> 43:50.800
ITS LEGAL TRADITION.

43:50.866 --> 43:54.433
>> Bill: WHAT ARE WE TALKING

43:54.500 --> 43:59.066
ABOUT?

43:59.133 --> 43:59.700
>> THESE PREEMPTORY CHALLENGES,

43:59.766 --> 44:00.266
THEY ARE NOT CONSTITUTIONAL,

44:00.333 --> 44:00.866
THEY ARE A LEGAL TRADITION, WE

44:00.933 --> 44:01.700
CAN DO AWAY WITH IT IF WE HAD

44:01.766 --> 44:03.733
THE WILL, IT'S NOT A SKILL

44:03.800 --> 44:07.633
PROBLEM, IT'S A WILL PROBLEM.

44:07.700 --> 44:08.266
THE OTHER THING I WANT TO COME

44:08.333 --> 44:10.800
BACK TO IS A POINT YOU MADE

44:10.866 --> 44:11.433
EARLIER, THE PROSECUTION USE THE

44:11.500 --> 44:13.700
CHALLENGES AND SO THE DEFENSE,

44:13.766 --> 44:19.400
IN THE AHMAUD ARBERY TRIAL.

44:19.466 --> 44:19.966
BOTH SIDES CAN DO IT BUT ONE

44:20.033 --> 44:23.133
SIDE SUFFERS DISPROPORTIONATELY.

44:23.200 --> 44:23.766
PEOPLE OF COLOR SUFFER THE MOST

44:23.833 --> 44:27.033
WHEN THAT IS DONE.

44:27.100 --> 44:37.400
[APPLAUSE]

44:37.466 --> 44:37.966
>> Bill: I UNDERSTAND THAT,

44:38.033 --> 44:38.566
IT'S TROUBLING AS AN OMEN OF

44:38.633 --> 44:39.166
THINGS TO COME WHEN WE DIVIDE

44:39.233 --> 44:39.733
THIS WAY WHEN WE ARE LIKE I

44:39.800 --> 44:40.366
DON'T TRUST ANY BLACK PEOPLE, I

44:40.433 --> 44:40.966
DON'T TRUST ANY WHITE PEOPLE.

44:41.033 --> 44:41.600
IT'S LIKE PRISON.

44:41.666 --> 44:45.933
YOU HAVE TO JOIN A TRIBE.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
I DON'T WANT AMERICA TO GO IN

44:47.066 --> 44:48.366
THAT DIRECTION AND I DON'T THINK

44:48.433 --> 44:50.166
WE ARE BEING LED IN THE RIGHT

44:50.233 --> 44:51.900
DIRECTION BY EITHER SIDE.

44:51.966 --> 44:54.500
>> WHEN YOU SAY WE, THAT'S THE

44:54.566 --> 44:55.566
ONLY ISSUE, WHAT WE ARE YOU

44:55.633 --> 44:57.666
TALKING ABOUT?

44:57.733 --> 44:59.100
BLACK FOLK AND BROWN PEOPLE

44:59.166 --> 44:59.900
AREN'T DOING ANYTHING TO THE

44:59.966 --> 45:02.100
LARGER WHITE COMMUNITY.

45:02.166 --> 45:04.066
>> Bill: WE, THE COUNTRY.

45:04.133 --> 45:05.600
>> BUT WHO WAS THE WEEK LET'S

45:05.666 --> 45:07.566
MAKE SOME OF US ARE NOT ENGAGED

45:07.633 --> 45:11.733
IN THAT NONSENSE ACTIVITY.

45:11.800 --> 45:13.133

45:20.966 --> 45:21.933
IGNORANCE IS A POWERFUL WEAPON."

45:22.000 --> 45:25.666
I DON'T THINK THAT HELPS.

45:25.733 --> 45:27.333
ON AN OLD-SCHOOL LIBERAL, I

45:27.400 --> 45:28.300
BELIEVE IN A COLOR-BLIND

45:28.366 --> 45:31.500
SOCIETY, THAT'S NOT WHERE WOKE

45:31.566 --> 45:31.700
IS.

45:35.333 --> 45:38.766
KNOW YOU'RE A RACIST.

45:38.833 --> 45:40.300
SO YES, THERE'S SOME WE ON THE

45:40.366 --> 45:40.733
OTHER SIDE.

SITTING IN A PARK, GETTING A BAD

49:17.166 --> 49:25.766
HAIRCUT.

49:25.833 --> 49:26.033
[LAUGHTER]

49:26.100 --> 49:26.300
[APPLAUSE]

49:26.366 --> 49:27.666
IT'S EASY, YOU JUST PUT ON

49:27.733 --> 49:28.666
GOGGLES, GLOVES, AND, I DON'T

49:28.733 --> 49:32.033
KNOW, SUCTION CUPS ON YOUR

49:32.100 --> 49:33.566
BALLS, AND NOW YOU'RE IN THE

49:33.633 --> 49:35.633
MAGICAL LAND OF THE METAVERSE.

49:35.700 --> 49:36.733
BECAUSE EVERYONE LOOKS COOL WITH

49:36.800 --> 49:41.300
SHIT STRAPPED TO THEIR HEAD.

49:41.366 --> 49:41.566
[LAUGHTER]

49:41.633 --> 49:42.166
IN THE METAVERSE, YOU CAN TOUR

49:42.233 --> 49:43.466
THE PYRAMIDS OR HAVE A SWORD

49:43.533 --> 49:46.833
FIGHT WITH A DUCK, ALL WITHOUT

49:46.900 --> 49:48.433
HAVING TO LEAVE THE COMFORT OF

49:48.500 --> 49:58.700
YOUR PARENT'S BASEMENT.

49:58.766 --> 49:58.966
[LAUGHTER]

49:59.033 --> 49:59.233
[APPLAUSE]

49:59.300 --> 49:59.866
WE'VE ALL SEEN THIS DEPICTED IN

49:59.933 --> 50:01.100
MOVIES LIKE "READY PLAYER ONE,"

50:01.166 --> 50:02.366
WHERE AN ELABORATE METAVERSE

50:02.433 --> 50:03.700
SERVES AS A RETREAT FOR PEOPLE

50:03.766 --> 50:04.666
TO ESCAPE THE MISERY OF

50:04.733 --> 50:06.433
EXISTENCE.

50:06.500 --> 50:07.766
SOMETHING I ALWAYS FELT WAS

50:07.833 --> 50:15.466
BETTER HANDLED BY WEED.

50:15.533 --> 50:16.666
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

50:16.733 --> 50:18.666
BUT I'M NOT A VISIONARY LIKE

50:18.733 --> 50:20.500
MARK ZUCKERBERG -- I TRIED

50:20.566 --> 50:25.000
VIRTUAL REALITY ONCE, AND I

50:25.066 --> 50:26.433
DON'T KNOW I PUT ON THE GOGGLES

50:26.500 --> 50:27.466
AND SUDDENLY I WAS IN A HOT AIR

50:27.533 --> 50:28.233
BALLOON OVER FRANCE, AND THEN I

50:28.300 --> 50:30.300
WAS RIDING A BROOMSTICK AROUND

50:30.366 --> 50:31.566
HOGWARTS, AND THEN I WAS IN THE

50:31.633 --> 50:37.200
BATHROOM THROWING UP.

50:37.266 --> 50:37.466
[LAUGHTER]

50:37.533 --> 50:38.133
IT WAS LIKE GETTING ROOFIED BY

50:38.200 --> 50:44.066
WALT DISNEY.

50:44.133 --> 50:45.100
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

50:45.166 --> 50:47.066
HERE'S SOME ACTUAL FOOTAGE FROM

50:47.133 --> 50:48.433
ZUCKERBERG'S RECENT PRESENTATION

50:48.500 --> 50:49.466
ABOUT WHAT THIS NEW WORLD WILL

50:49.533 --> 50:51.900
LOOK LIKE.

50:51.966 --> 50:53.133
THAT'S RIGHT, YOU'RE AT A

50:53.200 --> 50:56.633
CONCERT -- WITH A FRIEND WHO

50:56.700 --> 50:58.833
SEEMS TO BE A GHOST, AND A

50:58.900 --> 50:59.100
[LAUGHTER]

50:59.166 --> 50:59.833
GIRAFFE, WHO HAS BETTER SEATS

50:59.900 --> 51:01.933
THAN YOU.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.066
WHICH IS SELFISH WHEN YOU'RE

51:04.133 --> 51:05.600
THAT TALL.

51:05.666 --> 51:07.766
BUT THAT'S MARK'S VISION: THAT

51:07.833 --> 51:10.400
TWO FRIENDS CAN ATTEND A CONCERT

51:10.466 --> 51:13.733
TOGETHER WHEN IN REALITY -- I

51:13.800 --> 51:15.266
MEAN, THE OLD REALITY -- BOTH

51:15.333 --> 51:17.000
ARE REALLY SITTING AT HOME.

51:17.066 --> 51:18.400
WHAT GREAT FUN, ESPECIALLY FOR

51:18.466 --> 51:19.666
THE BAND PLAYING TO AN EMPTY

51:19.733 --> 51:21.133
STADIUM.

51:21.200 --> 51:22.066
THAT'S RIGHT, A CONCERT WHERE NO

51:22.133 --> 51:23.300
ONE HAS TO ACTUALLY BE AT THE

51:23.366 --> 51:24.566
CONCERT.

51:24.633 --> 51:25.466
OR AS TRAVIS SCOTT SAID, "NOW

51:25.533 --> 51:33.033
YOU TELL ME."

51:33.100 --> 51:36.400
[GROANING]

51:36.466 --> 51:37.500
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

51:37.566 --> 51:38.733
BUT I MUST SAY, I'M A LITTLE

51:38.800 --> 51:39.633
WORRIED THAT IF WE GET OURSELVES

51:39.700 --> 51:40.566
TOO FAR AWAY FROM REALITY, WE

51:40.633 --> 51:41.566
WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND OUR WAY

51:41.633 --> 51:43.066
BACK.

51:43.133 --> 51:45.500
PHONY USED TO BE A BAD THING,

51:45.566 --> 51:47.733
AND "KEEPING IT REAL" WAS GOOD.

51:47.800 --> 51:48.800
THAT'S WHY I NAMED THIS SHOW

51:48.866 --> 51:58.333
REAL TIME AND NOT AVATAR TIME.

51:58.400 --> 51:58.600
[LAUGHTER]

51:58.666 --> 52:00.133
[APPLAUSE]

52:00.200 --> 52:01.533
WE JUST WENT THROUGH A PANDEMIC

52:01.600 --> 52:03.133
-- THE LAST THING I WANT IS MORE

52:03.200 --> 52:04.766
VIRTUAL, AND THAT'S WHAT THE

52:04.833 --> 52:05.700
METAVERSE SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GOING

52:05.766 --> 52:06.766
TO BE: THE PANDEMIC YEAR, EXCEPT

52:06.833 --> 52:08.400
FOREVER.

52:08.466 --> 52:10.133
YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF, WHY

52:10.200 --> 52:11.900
DOES MARK ZUCKERBERG THINK

52:11.966 --> 52:13.366
LIVING IN A METAVERSE WOULD BE

52:13.433 --> 52:16.166
SO MUCH BETTER?

52:16.233 --> 52:18.766
BECAUSE LOOK AT HIM: THE DEAD

52:18.833 --> 52:21.133
EYES, THE LACK OF RECOGNIZABLE

52:21.200 --> 52:23.266
HUMAN FEATURES, THE PAINTED-ON

52:23.333 --> 52:29.100
HAIR -- HE'S ALREADY AN AVATAR.

52:29.166 --> 52:32.133
[LAUGHTER]

52:32.200 --> 52:33.833
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

52:33.900 --> 52:34.633
I'M PRETTY SURE THE PERSON WE

52:34.700 --> 52:37.500
THINK IS ZUCKERBERG IS A SIM,

52:37.566 --> 52:39.800
WHILE THE REAL ONE LIVES ON A

52:39.866 --> 52:44.666
YACHT STAFFED BY 100 BEAUTIFUL

52:44.733 --> 52:45.533
WOMEN WHERE HE PLAYS POKÉMON GO

52:45.600 --> 52:47.933
ALL DAY.

52:48.000 --> 52:48.966
THIS IS THE WORST KIND OF PERSON

52:49.033 --> 52:49.233
[LAUGHTER]

52:49.300 --> 52:49.833
TO MAKE THE OVERLORD OF A NEW

52:49.900 --> 52:50.766
UNIVERSE.

52:50.833 --> 52:52.000
EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC NEARLY

52:52.066 --> 52:54.666
THREE IN TEN AMERICAN MALES

52:54.733 --> 52:56.133
BETWEEN 18 AND 30 WEREN'T HAVING

52:56.200 --> 52:58.000
SEX -- ALMOST TRIPLE WHAT THAT

52:58.066 --> 52:59.833
NUMBER WAS TEN YEARS EARLIER.

52:59.900 --> 53:02.833
THE CLOSEST THEY COME TO TALKING

53:02.900 --> 53:10.533
TO A GIRL IS ALEXA.

53:10.600 --> 53:10.800
[LAUGHTER]

53:10.866 --> 53:11.066
[APPLAUSE]

53:11.133 --> 53:12.433
AND SPENDING SO MUCH TIME ON

53:12.500 --> 53:13.433
SCREENS HAS A LOT TO DO WITH

53:13.500 --> 53:14.633
THAT.

53:14.700 --> 53:17.000
THIS IS THE PHENOMENON KNOWN AS

53:17.066 --> 53:18.566
"INCELS" -- INCELS, THAT'S SHORT

53:18.633 --> 53:21.333
FOR INVOLUNTARILY CELIBATE.

53:21.400 --> 53:22.933
AND IT'S NOT HARMLESS.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.900
IT NEVER IS WHEN ANY SOCIETY,

53:25.966 --> 53:27.466
FOR WHATEVER REASON CREATES MEN

53:27.533 --> 53:30.700
WHO ARE CUT OFF FROM WOMEN, AND

53:30.766 --> 53:33.566
IT'S NOT GOING WELL HERE WITH

53:33.633 --> 53:34.966
INCELS, WHICH HAS BECOME A TOXIC

53:35.033 --> 53:37.966
SUBCULTURE OF ANGRY,

53:38.033 --> 53:39.766
MISOGYNISTIC DIGITAL EUNUCHS --

53:39.833 --> 53:41.500
AND THE METAVERSE IS ONLY GONNA

53:41.566 --> 53:43.100
MAKE IT META WORSE.

53:43.166 --> 53:44.666
BECAUSE IT'S A VICIOUS CYCLE:

53:44.733 --> 53:46.300
THE MORE TIME YOU SPEND IN THE

53:46.366 --> 53:48.566
VIRTUAL WORLD, THE MORE YOU SUCK

53:48.633 --> 53:54.966
AT ENGAGING IN THE REAL WORLD,

53:55.033 --> 54:01.100
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

54:01.166 --> 54:03.900
SO THE MORE YOU RETREAT INTO THE

54:05.500 --> 54:07.133
YOUR REAL SOCIAL SKILLS,

54:07.200 --> 54:08.000
INCLUDING, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,

54:08.066 --> 54:14.700

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

54:18.800 --> 54:19.666

54:19.733 --> 54:20.966
THIS IS THE CYCLE OF "GET A

54:21.033 --> 54:22.866

54:36.366 --> 54:37.866
BADLY -- ALL THE MOVIES ARE

THERE'S ALWAYS A HERO RISING.

55:16.066 --> 55:19.233
TO ASK SOMEONE OUT.

55:20.966 --> 55:23.766

55:52.733 --> 55:54.166
UP TO A GIRL.

55:54.233 --> 55:55.400
AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT, THEN

55:55.466 --> 55:56.266
YOU CAN GO HOME AND SPANK IT TO
