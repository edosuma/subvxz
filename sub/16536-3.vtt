WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:02.044
My name is Tom Kirkman.

00:02.169 --> 00:05.214
Last night, I was sworn in
as President of the United States.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.591
<i>Previously on Designated Survivor...</i>

00:07.717 --> 00:09.093
Yesterday, I was asked to resign.

00:09.218 --> 00:11.887
Now I'm trying to put
the entire U.S. government back together.

00:12.013 --> 00:13.848
This is Congresswoman Kimble Hookstraten.

00:13.973 --> 00:15.683
Last night's other designated survivor.

00:15.808 --> 00:17.309
We know who blew up the Capitol.

00:17.435 --> 00:19.520
I gave the President
the most relevant intel.

00:19.645 --> 00:22.356
Or you gave him what the group
who did this wanted you to.

00:22.481 --> 00:25.401
You need to convince your new boss
that Al-Sakar is behind the bombing.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.570
Until he's certain,
he will not name anyone.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.072
We found one!
We got a survivor over here!

00:30.656 --> 00:32.198
- Hey, he's alive!
- Come on!

00:32.323 --> 00:34.118
Can you move your arms or legs?

00:34.243 --> 00:35.745
You'll be all right. Hang on.
We're getting to you.

00:35.870 --> 00:37.496
All right, everybody, back up!

00:37.621 --> 00:39.457
- We gotta get him out.
- Got that side.

00:55.931 --> 00:57.683
Give him room. Give him room!

00:57.808 --> 00:59.060
Okay, let's get him on the stretcher.

00:59.185 --> 01:02.146
- Ready? One, two, three, lift.
- Got him?

01:02.271 --> 01:03.814
Okay, careful. Watch his head.

01:03.939 --> 01:04.857
Watch out.

01:04.982 --> 01:06.776
All right, set him down here.
Set him down here, guys.

01:06.901 --> 01:08.944
All right, let's put him down. All right.

01:09.070 --> 01:10.613
Slowly, slowly.

01:13.657 --> 01:17.495
The nation is captivated
by Congressman Peter MacLeish,

01:17.620 --> 01:19.872
found alive in the Capitol ruins,

01:19.997 --> 01:24.168
making him the only survivor thus far
of the unspeakable act

01:24.293 --> 01:30.007
that has claimed more than 1,000 lives,
including the President, Vice President,

01:30.132 --> 01:32.009
<i>and nearly all of Congress.</i>

01:32.134 --> 01:35.596
<i>At 35 years old, MacLeish,
a popular third-term legislator</i>

01:35.721 --> 01:37.515
<i>and decorated war hero,</i>

01:37.640 --> 01:40.226
<i>is one of the nation's
youngest congressmen.</i>

01:40.351 --> 01:42.937
<i>Congressman MacLeish
is under doctor's care at the...</i>

01:44.396 --> 01:45.648
Sorry. Train's still down.

01:47.650 --> 01:50.528
Unbelievable, right?
He's like a human silver lining.

01:50.653 --> 01:52.363
Yeah, it's amazing
somebody could survive that.

01:52.488 --> 01:54.198
Maybe there will be others.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.283
Good morning, everyone.

01:56.408 --> 01:57.701
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

01:57.827 --> 01:59.328
Please, sit.

02:03.332 --> 02:05.042
Thank you for coming in so early.

02:05.167 --> 02:07.545
We've got a big day,
so let's just get started.

02:07.670 --> 02:10.548
Seth, how's it coming with the eulogy
for President Richmond's funeral?

02:10.673 --> 02:11.715
Good, you'll have a draft soon.

02:11.841 --> 02:14.426
I understand it's a private ceremony,
but it's gonna be televised

02:14.552 --> 02:16.011
and the entire country
could use some hope.

02:16.137 --> 02:17.888
I'd like to mention Congressman MacLeish.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.890
Definitely, sir. I also have
President Richmond's son, Tyler,

02:20.015 --> 02:22.893
coming in to share some memories,
make the speech a little more personal.

02:23.018 --> 02:24.145
Good idea.

02:24.270 --> 02:26.147
Let him know I'll join.
I'd like to meet him.

02:26.272 --> 02:28.023
- Yes, sir.
- Where are we at with Al-Sakar?

02:28.149 --> 02:29.275
Any updates from the Joint Chiefs?

02:29.400 --> 02:31.235
NSC is seeking
that additional proof you asked for,

02:31.360 --> 02:32.695
that they're responsible for the bombing.

02:32.820 --> 02:33.904
Sir, they're briefing me hourly.

02:34.029 --> 02:34.905
And good news from Michigan.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.949
Governor Royce is behaving.
There's been no new reports

02:37.074 --> 02:38.951
of Muslims being harassed,
but I'll monitor it.

02:39.076 --> 02:39.910
Good. What else?

02:40.035 --> 02:42.163
Surviving deputies of Treasury
and the Fed, they need a meeting.

02:42.288 --> 02:44.248
I'll reach out to them
as soon we're finished here.

02:44.373 --> 02:46.458
And don't forget, you have
the Elizabeth Vargas interview at noon.

02:46.584 --> 02:48.419
We'll go over the talking points
right before.

02:48.544 --> 02:50.462
Aaron, Emily,
I want your list for the Cabinet--

02:50.588 --> 02:51.714
What's happening?

02:51.839 --> 02:53.465
Oh. Wait!

02:54.466 --> 02:56.093
<i>...just went dark.</i>

02:59.471 --> 03:01.765
This is the White House.
There aren't supposed to be any blackouts.

03:01.891 --> 03:03.976
Unless, and I really hate to say this,

03:04.101 --> 03:05.519
- but what if it's--
- A second attack.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.813
- Guys, what the hell's going on?
- Looks like a power surge.

03:08.606 --> 03:09.982
Backup generator
should kick on any minute.

03:12.985 --> 03:13.986
Network's down.

03:14.111 --> 03:14.987
Yeah, I got nothing.

03:15.112 --> 03:16.363
White House line is dead.

03:16.488 --> 03:17.448
This isn't good.

03:17.573 --> 03:19.450
What is that?

03:20.868 --> 03:22.494
On the grid... That's no power surge.

03:22.620 --> 03:25.039
Looks like a real-time intrusion
into the White House network.

03:25.164 --> 03:27.291
I'm on with Fort Meade.
NSA thinks it's just a sniffer,

03:27.416 --> 03:29.126
some kid poking
around our electrical grid.

03:29.251 --> 03:30.836
NSA's wrong. This is no sniffer.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.963
Agent Ritter, that's the Oval Office.

03:33.088 --> 03:34.506
Cut the link.

03:34.632 --> 03:35.674
I'm trying. It won't work.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.802
Section 2 is still completely dark.

03:38.928 --> 03:40.721
- What is going on?!
- What's happening?

03:42.848 --> 03:43.641
My computer's out.

03:43.766 --> 03:45.059
Yeah, mine's out, too. Sir?

03:45.184 --> 03:46.435
Nothing.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.771
Mr. President, I need you
to step away from your computer.

03:49.438 --> 03:50.272
Mike, what's going on?

03:51.857 --> 03:53.901
The White House has just been hacked.

04:08.123 --> 04:11.460
EOP Security is calling it
a one-time malicious cyber intrusion.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.046
Against what's supposed to be
the most secure network on Earth?

04:14.171 --> 04:16.214
The public is gonna consider this
another attack.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.218
That's why the public can't find out.
There's too much chaos as it is.

04:19.343 --> 04:21.678
- This can't get out.
- We have no idea what they were after,

04:21.803 --> 04:23.430
or if our files were compromised.

04:23.555 --> 04:24.640
Not yet, sir.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.393
NSA's still completing their scans
of all the White House computers.

04:27.518 --> 04:29.144
Any idea who might have done this?

04:29.270 --> 04:31.438
Could be the Russians.
Could be the North Koreans.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.357
Or the people
that bombed the Capitol building.

04:33.482 --> 04:34.942
Yes, sir.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.026
We're following every lead.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.280
Okay, thank you, Mike.

04:39.822 --> 04:41.198
Keep me updated.

04:41.323 --> 04:42.199
Yes, sir.

04:42.992 --> 04:44.994
Look, given what's just happened,
we may want to cancel

04:45.119 --> 04:46.537
the Elizabeth Vargas interview.

04:46.662 --> 04:47.955
No,
that'll raise too many questions.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.540
We'll bring the crew
through the east entrance

04:49.665 --> 04:52.459
- so they don't get wind of the hack.
- I agree, has to be business as usual.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.336
You and I will meet
with Congresswoman Hookstraten

04:54.461 --> 04:55.963
and go over the Cabinet choices
as scheduled.

04:56.088 --> 04:56.922
Okay, good.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.758
Now if I could appoint the rest
of the government legally without a vote.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.719
That would certainly
help lighten your load.

05:01.844 --> 05:03.387
Yeah, so would choosing
your Chief of Staff.

05:09.226 --> 05:10.728
We're done here.

05:10.853 --> 05:12.396
Thank you.

05:35.461 --> 05:37.046
Do you think there are others?

05:37.755 --> 05:39.882
36 hours...

05:41.633 --> 05:43.218
You never know, but...

05:43.344 --> 05:44.678
...it's not looking good.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.930
How did MacLeish survive?

05:47.723 --> 05:49.850
Those blasts...
they threw glass half a mile.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.560
There's 4,000 tons of debris out there.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.521
Sometimes things just defy logic, right?

05:54.646 --> 05:55.439
Common sense.

05:55.564 --> 05:56.690
Or science.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.902
But those are the same things
that give us hope...

06:00.778 --> 06:02.237
when the world is going to hell.

06:03.072 --> 06:05.949
That's why they call him
the Miracle on the Potomac.

06:06.075 --> 06:07.034
Has anyone talked to him?

06:07.868 --> 06:10.120
No, he's in Bethesda, 24-hour care.

06:10.245 --> 06:12.706
He's also the sole surviving witness
to the murder of 1,000 people.

06:12.831 --> 06:16.085
Don't you think we need to get there
and speak to him, see if he saw anything?

06:16.210 --> 06:18.170
We need all hands on deck right here.

06:18.295 --> 06:19.880
You already have over 50 agents out there

06:20.005 --> 06:22.049
sifting through rubble
and monitoring chatter.

06:22.174 --> 06:23.926
We don't need--

06:26.428 --> 06:28.972
I'm just saying that we need
to get a statement sooner or later.

06:32.768 --> 06:35.062
Don't make a mess I have to clean up.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.567
So, the President's computer
is the only one that's been compromised?

06:40.692 --> 06:43.070
Yeah. Just can't tell
if there have been any data spills.

06:43.779 --> 06:49.660
Usually, a frequency analysis
should pinpoint any infected modalities.

06:49.785 --> 06:51.036
That's weird.

06:51.161 --> 06:52.162
What?

06:52.287 --> 06:54.164
A PAL file, foreign format.

06:54.289 --> 06:57.584
President Kirkman
take any trips overseas lately?

07:02.506 --> 07:04.842
You know,
red line's been running since yesterday.

07:05.968 --> 07:08.011
I'm just saying,
if you want to be Chief of Staff,

07:08.137 --> 07:09.847
you might think
about leaving a little earlier.

07:10.431 --> 07:11.682
Not that it's any of your business,

07:11.807 --> 07:13.684
but my boyfriend asked me
to marry him this morning,

07:13.809 --> 07:16.603
and it's kind of rude
to walk out in the middle of a proposal.

07:16.728 --> 07:18.355
And you've been going out, what?

07:18.480 --> 07:19.523
10 months. Why?

07:21.108 --> 07:23.444
It's classic post-disaster acceleration.

07:24.486 --> 07:27.489
Look, traumatic events tend to make people
reevaluate their lives.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.950
You know, babies, marriage, divorce.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.202
It happened after 9/11.

07:32.828 --> 07:34.037
You're lucky, actually.

07:34.163 --> 07:36.039
Actually, I haven't decided yet.

07:36.165 --> 07:38.000
I get it. You want me to say yes

07:38.125 --> 07:40.627
so that I'll be distracted
and you'll get Chief of Staff.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.546
Wow, Aaron. Impressive.

07:42.671 --> 07:43.881
What are you talking about? Hey!

07:44.006 --> 07:46.758
Love in Washington
doesn't happen every day, Emily.

07:46.884 --> 07:48.844
You're lucky, actually.

07:50.888 --> 07:52.764
Ma'am.

07:52.890 --> 07:54.516
Congresswoman Hookstraten,
sorry to keep you waiting.

07:55.476 --> 07:56.852
So, why don't we get started, ma'am?

07:56.977 --> 08:00.105
We put together a list
of potential Cabinet choices.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.815
Since you're effectively Congress...

08:01.940 --> 08:04.568
These will probably be
the fastest confirmations in history.

08:05.486 --> 08:06.445
A question.

08:06.570 --> 08:09.656
Did President Kirkman
get a Best Buy gift card for Christmas,

08:09.781 --> 08:13.452
or is the White House
having some sort of security issue?

08:15.287 --> 08:16.288
What do you mean?

08:18.248 --> 08:21.960
I saw the IT staff removing every computer
from the West Wing.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.254
It's just some technical issues.
It's not a problem.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.716
Ms. Rhodes, Mr. Shore,
could you come with me, please?

08:27.841 --> 08:29.510
- What? Now?
- Yes, sir.

08:29.635 --> 08:30.677
It's important.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.263
Congresswoman, will you excuse us, please?

08:34.597 --> 08:38.059
Perhaps it's about that problem
you're not having.

08:42.356 --> 08:44.441
- You wanted to see us?
- Yes.

08:44.566 --> 08:48.278
The NSA and Homeland Security
just finished their analysis on the hack.

08:48.403 --> 08:51.073
All of our data, files, codes,
everything's intact.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.325
What, so you're saying
they didn't take anything?

08:54.284 --> 08:56.578
No, they left something behind.

08:58.247 --> 08:59.790
I am Majid Nassar.

08:59.915 --> 09:04.795
At your Capitol building,
my Al-Sakar Martyrs Brigade

09:04.920 --> 09:06.672
annihilated your government

09:06.797 --> 09:08.924
so you, too, can experience

09:09.049 --> 09:14.054
the same terror and death
that you have visited upon our lands.

09:14.179 --> 09:18.100
Righteousness is our guide,
and we are many.

09:18.934 --> 09:21.520
God is great. God is great.

09:21.645 --> 09:22.980
God is great.

09:23.105 --> 09:24.565
Mr. President.

09:25.816 --> 09:27.442
You asked for more proof.

09:28.277 --> 09:29.611
There it is.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.738
We have our enemy.

09:38.412 --> 09:41.123
And we are absolutely certain
this is Majid Nassar?

09:41.248 --> 09:44.876
Yes, sir.
NCTC confirms dialect is a match.

09:45.002 --> 09:46.753
Facial analysts, behavioral psychologists,

09:46.878 --> 09:49.506
leadership profilers, they all concur.

09:49.631 --> 09:50.882
What is it, sir?

09:54.553 --> 09:56.513
Al Jazeera was always good enough
for Bin Laden

09:56.638 --> 09:58.098
to release information statements.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.517
Why would Nassar go to all the trouble

10:00.642 --> 10:03.145
to hack the most secure network
in the world

10:03.270 --> 10:05.147
just to deliver this video to me? It...

10:05.272 --> 10:06.315
It doesn't feel right.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.525
I believe he did it, sir,
to show us he can.

10:08.650 --> 10:09.943
He's taunting us.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.862
Mr. President,
I do think it's important

10:11.987 --> 10:14.448
to take note that Al-Sakar
has taken credit for attacks

10:14.573 --> 10:16.241
committed by others in the past,

10:16.366 --> 10:18.952
the Moroccan nightclub bombing, 2013.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.288
I remember. They claimed responsibility
for the bombing,

10:21.413 --> 10:23.915
but eventually Israeli Intelligence proved
that it was Al-Shabaab.

10:24.041 --> 10:27.336
Okay, any other reasons
to believe that Al-Sakar

10:27.461 --> 10:29.338
was not behind the attack?

10:31.965 --> 10:33.717
Anyone, please?

10:35.177 --> 10:36.678
Come on. Anybody?

10:38.221 --> 10:40.098
Mr. President,
Jason Atwood,

10:40.223 --> 10:42.267
Deputy Director, FBI.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.603
We met at the Capitol site.
You have another theory?

10:44.728 --> 10:46.104
Not me, one of my agents.

10:46.229 --> 10:48.774
She believes
that the evidence was manipulated

10:48.899 --> 10:50.108
to point toward Al-Sakar

10:50.233 --> 10:52.611
so we wouldn't consider
any other suspects.

10:52.736 --> 10:53.779
What evidence?

10:53.904 --> 10:55.238
The unexploded ordinance.

10:55.364 --> 10:57.449
She thinks that it was not a mistake,

10:57.991 --> 11:00.786
and it was left there on purpose
to be found.

11:00.911 --> 11:02.204
And you believe this?

11:03.163 --> 11:05.415
I'm not sure, but I do believe in her.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.084
Sir...

11:08.293 --> 11:09.920
what are your orders?

11:19.137 --> 11:22.474
Until we can confirm
that Nassar actually did what he says,

11:22.599 --> 11:25.143
no one outside these walls
sees that video, understood?

11:25.268 --> 11:26.603
In the meantime,

11:26.728 --> 11:28.188
track the son of a bitch down.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.982
Whatever cave,
cavern or hole he's hiding in,

11:31.108 --> 11:33.318
I want you to find me Majid Nassar.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.824
<i>...and we are many.</i>

11:38.949 --> 11:41.868
<i>God is great. God is great.</i>

11:41.993 --> 11:43.245
<i>God is great.</i>

11:43.370 --> 11:45.205
Thank you for showing this to me, sir.

11:45.330 --> 11:48.291
I knew you had questions earlier
about what was happening in the West Wing,

11:48.417 --> 11:49.918
and since you represent Congress,

11:50.043 --> 11:51.586
I think it's important to bring you in

11:51.712 --> 11:54.214
on everything
that involves national security.

11:54.339 --> 11:55.424
- Thank you.
- I hope you understand

11:55.549 --> 11:57.300
that we cannot show this
to the public yet,

11:57.426 --> 12:00.262
not until we can prove
that every statement in the video is true.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.432
Otherwise, we run the risk
of a national call to arms.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.267
Would that be such a terrible thing?

12:05.767 --> 12:07.310
I mean, with all due respect, sir,

12:07.436 --> 12:09.062
we need an enemy, and soon.

12:09.187 --> 12:12.315
It's the only thing that will pull us all
together after this terrible attack.

12:12.441 --> 12:14.025
Kimble, we need the right enemy.

12:14.151 --> 12:17.404
We need to be absolutely certain
who did this before we strike.

12:18.530 --> 12:19.698
And personally, I...

12:19.823 --> 12:21.283
I have a difficult time accepting

12:21.408 --> 12:24.202
that the only way to bring
the country together is through war.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.247
You have a lot of difficult decisions
ahead of you, sir.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.541
Speaking for Congress,
I want to assure you

12:29.666 --> 12:31.960
that you have my complete support
no matter what you decide.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.462
Thank you.

12:34.629 --> 12:36.089
And I would never want your job.

12:36.214 --> 12:38.175
Well, that makes two of us.

12:38.300 --> 12:41.136
Good luck with Elizabeth Vargas,
not that you need it.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.929
You're a natural, sir.

12:51.188 --> 12:54.775
<i>Congressman MacLeish,
Special Agent Hannah Wells, FBI.</i>

12:54.900 --> 12:55.817
<i>FBI...</i>

12:57.944 --> 12:59.112
How are you?

13:00.822 --> 13:05.118
Alive, so... lucky... mostly.

13:06.495 --> 13:08.872
This may be too soon, but, um...

13:09.414 --> 13:11.666
I came here because
I was wondering if you could tell me

13:11.792 --> 13:15.045
anything about that night,
anything you can remember,

13:15.170 --> 13:17.297
something that looked out of place
or didn't add up.

13:18.048 --> 13:19.549
I have no idea.

13:21.176 --> 13:22.803
I was sitting in my seat...

13:23.970 --> 13:26.431
watching the President speak,
and then...

13:27.224 --> 13:28.809
everything went black.

13:30.685 --> 13:31.728
I lost...

13:32.687 --> 13:34.481
friends, colleagues...

13:35.690 --> 13:37.359
All of them.

13:37.484 --> 13:40.487
The only thing that doesn't add up is...

13:40.612 --> 13:42.322
why me?

13:43.782 --> 13:45.158
Why'd I survive?

13:47.244 --> 13:48.578
Whatever you find out...

13:49.830 --> 13:51.915
please, you let me know.

14:01.132 --> 14:02.133
Tyler?

14:04.386 --> 14:05.804
I'm sorry we're late.

14:05.929 --> 14:06.888
Tom Kirkman.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.182
The President. I know.

14:10.100 --> 14:14.020
Words could never describe
how sorry I am for your incredible loss.

14:14.896 --> 14:16.439
Hi, I'm Seth Wright.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.859
I was a junior speech writer
under your father.

14:18.984 --> 14:20.402
- I'm sorry about your parents.
- Thank you.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.237
Seth is working on my eulogy

14:22.362 --> 14:24.030
for your father's service later today.

14:24.155 --> 14:26.074
We were hoping you might have
something personal to share.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.035
Uh... yeah.

14:29.160 --> 14:31.246
Um, my dad was...

14:32.789 --> 14:34.082
He was a great man...

14:34.207 --> 14:36.710
I had tremendous respect for him.

14:37.127 --> 14:41.006
...as a president, but, um,
you know, to me, he was just...

14:42.382 --> 14:43.675
Dad.

14:43.800 --> 14:47.137
I mean, he had the hardest job
in the world, you know, um,

14:47.262 --> 14:49.472
things coming at him from everyone
and everywhere,

14:49.598 --> 14:51.182
but...

14:51.308 --> 14:54.352
...you know, still,
he was always there for me, um...

14:54.477 --> 14:55.687
And now...

15:00.275 --> 15:03.111
I have some very big shoes to fill.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.405
Yeah, we both do.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.496
Why are <i>we</i>
unpacking Leo's stuff?

15:13.622 --> 15:16.458
Because this is our new home
and I want it to feel like home.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.877
And Leo will never do it.

15:20.045 --> 15:23.131
Hey, it's me. I got to make this quick.
I've got my interview waiting.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.215
About dinner tonight,

15:24.341 --> 15:27.052
how about the four of us,
family dinner, 6:30?

15:27.177 --> 15:29.804
Yeah. But where's this coming from?

15:30.513 --> 15:33.183
I need to have a reason
to want to have dinner with my family?

15:33.308 --> 15:34.351
<i>Okay, I'll see you then.</i>

15:34.476 --> 15:35.810
I love you. Bye.

15:38.396 --> 15:39.397
Mommy?

15:39.522 --> 15:40.774
What are these?

15:42.525 --> 15:45.195
Oh, those are just headache pills,
sweetie.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.657
I guess Leo gets a lot of headaches.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.377
Okay, let's go.

16:00.502 --> 16:01.962
So, you'll tape today to air tonight.

16:02.087 --> 16:03.922
This interview is a get.
Every network wanted it,

16:04.047 --> 16:06.174
but we hope Elizabeth Vargas
is a friend of the court.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.176
What if she brings up
the blackout?

16:08.301 --> 16:09.886
She won't, sir.
The story's been contained.

16:10.011 --> 16:11.888
This is all about
the country getting to know you.

16:12.013 --> 16:14.057
You want to be in command,
but approachable.

16:14.182 --> 16:17.143
Smart, but... relatable.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.479
What about sincere?

16:19.604 --> 16:20.814
Yeah, you could...

16:20.939 --> 16:23.149
Sincere could work.
You can go with sincere if you want.

16:23.274 --> 16:24.901
I'll go with sincere.

16:25.026 --> 16:27.988
<i>It is astonishing
that Congressman MacLeish survived.</i>

16:28.113 --> 16:30.240
It's incredibly encouraging
to have good news

16:30.365 --> 16:31.616
in these heartbreaking times.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.743
And difficult times, certainly, to lead,

16:33.868 --> 16:36.246
given the challenge
from the governor of Michigan,

16:36.371 --> 16:38.456
the near riot in the Capitol.

16:38.581 --> 16:41.126
Well, thankfully,
those crises were averted.

16:41.251 --> 16:44.879
But I have to say, the American people
have this unique ability

16:45.005 --> 16:47.090
to be at their best
when times are at their worst,

16:47.215 --> 16:49.259
and I'm counting on them
as much to get through this

16:49.384 --> 16:50.510
as they're counting on me.

16:50.635 --> 16:52.470
Your previous position in the Cabinet

16:52.595 --> 16:54.764
as Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development...

16:54.889 --> 16:58.101
It's not a natural stepping stone
to go from that position

16:58.226 --> 17:00.228
straight into the Oval Office.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.563
No. No, it's not.

17:01.688 --> 17:05.650
And, to be honest, I have never had
any aspirations for the presidency.

17:05.775 --> 17:06.693
Ever.

17:06.818 --> 17:08.862
When I came to Washington,
I came to help people.

17:08.987 --> 17:10.864
- Home stretch.
- Mr. President, I have one last question,

17:10.989 --> 17:14.242
and this is something we have
just unearthed. I wanted to give you

17:14.367 --> 17:16.286
a chance to address it.
We have sources

17:16.411 --> 17:18.538
telling us, and I'd like
your comment on this, please...

17:18.663 --> 17:19.622
Where is this going?

17:19.748 --> 17:21.124
Somewhere I don't like.

17:21.249 --> 17:24.210
...that President Richmond fired you

17:24.335 --> 17:27.172
from his Cabinet
on the day of the attack in the Capitol.

17:27.297 --> 17:28.173
Mr. President...

17:28.298 --> 17:29.549
Were you fired?

17:29.674 --> 17:30.967
And... and if you were,

17:31.092 --> 17:33.928
can you understand why some may say
you have no business being...

17:34.054 --> 17:35.930
the President of the United States?

17:40.643 --> 17:42.228
Mr. President, were you fired?

17:42.353 --> 17:44.522
Sir? Please?

17:46.483 --> 17:48.568
I'm sorry.
Can you excuse me for one second?

17:48.693 --> 17:50.361
- Of course.
- Thank you.

17:57.619 --> 18:00.121
I have no idea
how they got a hold of that information.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.164
Maybe from the hack?

18:01.664 --> 18:03.166
No, NSA said our files
weren't compromised.

18:03.291 --> 18:05.043
This is on the record.
I have to answer.

18:05.168 --> 18:06.294
You have to tell the truth.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.629
Are you kidding me?

18:07.754 --> 18:09.422
Aaron, it's already out there.
Besides, he wasn't fired.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.341
That's perception.
Nobody's gonna see it that way.

18:11.466 --> 18:12.634
Sir, you admit to this,

18:12.759 --> 18:14.886
you bring down your presidency
before it even begins.

18:15.011 --> 18:17.639
Deny it and you start
your presidency off with a lie.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.146
I'll take it from here.

18:29.901 --> 18:31.486
I'm sorry for the interruption.

18:32.570 --> 18:34.030
Do you mind asking the question again?

18:34.155 --> 18:35.073
Of course.

18:35.198 --> 18:36.574
Mr. President,

18:36.699 --> 18:39.536
were you fired by President Richmond
on the day of the attack?

18:39.661 --> 18:42.122
No, I was offered another assignment,

18:42.247 --> 18:44.582
an ambassadorship,
which I had not accepted yet.

18:44.707 --> 18:46.334
Did you request this transfer?

18:48.336 --> 18:49.546
No, I did not.

18:49.671 --> 18:51.339
So, is it safe to say

18:51.464 --> 18:54.676
President Richmond no longer wanted you
to serve in his Cabinet?

18:54.801 --> 18:56.052
That would be correct.

18:59.389 --> 19:02.225
<i>...our mothers
and their fathers</i>

19:02.350 --> 19:04.269
<i>and their--</i>

19:04.394 --> 19:06.771
Show me
that front angle of MacLeish again.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.314
Uh, what are you looking for?

19:08.439 --> 19:11.192
An explanation
for why 1,000 people are dead, Chuck.

19:13.027 --> 19:14.445
<i>And their fathers and their--</i>

19:14.571 --> 19:15.530
There.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.739
Go back.

19:17.240 --> 19:18.158
To where it cuts out.

19:18.283 --> 19:19.075
Freeze.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.493
- Look.
- The time code. So?

19:20.618 --> 19:22.912
The Capitol blew up at 10:08:04, right?

19:23.037 --> 19:23.913
Mm-hmm.

19:24.038 --> 19:27.584
So why did the feed cut out
34 seconds before the Capitol exploded?

19:27.709 --> 19:29.252
Right, Kline's been looking into that.

19:29.377 --> 19:32.422
Working theory is someone tampered
with the on-site control panel,

19:32.547 --> 19:34.174
you know,
where the feed was broadcast from.

19:34.299 --> 19:36.593
But it's hard for him to prove it
because the panel exploded--

19:36.718 --> 19:38.428
Right. Okay. All right. Rewind. Rewind.

19:43.391 --> 19:44.559
Wait. Freeze.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.352
Zoom in.

19:47.145 --> 19:49.022
Who's the woman with the camera?

19:49.772 --> 19:51.399
- I don't know.
- Check the seating chart.

19:51.900 --> 19:54.444
And then I want you
to download the contents of her cloud.

19:54.569 --> 19:56.237
I wanna see every photo
she took that night.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.656
Maybe she got something
during those missing 34 seconds.

19:59.490 --> 20:02.285
You want me to hack a dead woman's phone
without an Order to Compel?

20:02.410 --> 20:04.078
It'll take too long.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.999
Not gonna make these people any deader.

20:11.085 --> 20:14.964
Chuck,
the greatest act of terrorism since 9/11

20:15.089 --> 20:18.259
was just perpetrated on our soil,
and I need to know what happened.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.720
And if we don't play dirty,
we don't stand a chance.

20:22.430 --> 20:23.556
Do it.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.698
It's not there.

20:44.035 --> 20:44.911
MDMA, right?

20:45.036 --> 20:46.120
Mom.

20:46.246 --> 20:48.456
At least that's what the Internet says.

20:48.581 --> 20:49.791
It's not what you think--

20:49.916 --> 20:55.046
Oh, really? Because I think
my teenage son is dealing drugs.

20:55.171 --> 20:56.756
Possession with intent to distribute.

20:56.881 --> 20:58.216
And that is a felony.

20:58.341 --> 20:59.968
Penny found it.

21:00.093 --> 21:01.803
Do you know
what would have happened to her

21:01.928 --> 21:03.805
if she'd taken even one of those?

21:03.930 --> 21:06.724
What... I mean, she's 8.
It's not like she's stupid.

21:06.849 --> 21:08.601
And what's your excuse?!

21:08.726 --> 21:10.603
Ma'am, the motorcade for
President Richmond's funeral is waiting.

21:10.728 --> 21:11.604
Of course.

21:12.438 --> 21:13.690
We are not done.

21:38.339 --> 21:40.383
You seem distracted. You all right?

21:40.508 --> 21:41.801
Yeah, it's just Leo.

21:42.510 --> 21:43.553
It can wait.

21:52.061 --> 21:52.854
Mr. President,

21:52.979 --> 21:54.689
here are the changes we made
to your remarks.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.357
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.818
I'm sorry, sir. The printers
are still down in the West Wing.

22:00.695 --> 22:02.238
- Okay, good.
- Is that your eulogy?

22:02.363 --> 22:05.158
Tyler, yeah.
I just made some last-minute changes.

22:05.283 --> 22:07.201
Well, don't bother.
You won't be needing it.

22:07.327 --> 22:08.870
I'm sorry. Excuse me?

22:09.495 --> 22:11.831
I saw a clip of your interview online.

22:12.915 --> 22:14.208
My father fired you.

22:14.917 --> 22:17.420
I won't let you use his funeral
as some sort of PR stunt

22:17.545 --> 22:20.131
to make you look presidential
when he thought you were anything but.

22:20.256 --> 22:21.883
- Tyler, please, you don't under--
- You know what?

22:22.008 --> 22:23.968
Just save it for your next interview.

22:25.762 --> 22:28.389
- Ty--
- He can't do that. You are the President.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.268
No, he lost his father.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.896
We will respect his wishes.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.314
Come on.

22:44.238 --> 22:47.575
Tyler saw the interview.
He doesn't want me to do the eulogy.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.245
My father loved his job.

22:52.288 --> 22:55.666
And more than anything,
he loved the people he worked with.

22:57.377 --> 23:00.755
He was always grateful
to have allies across the aisle.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.174
I know he'd be pleased to have
one of those friends here today

23:03.299 --> 23:05.134
to say a few words.

23:05.259 --> 23:06.052
What'd he just say?

23:06.177 --> 23:08.554
Must be a mistake.
No one else is slated to speak.

23:08.679 --> 23:11.516
This person
is someone my father spoke about

23:11.641 --> 23:14.102
with great admiration and respect,

23:14.227 --> 23:17.480
and someone we are blessed
to have represent us

23:17.605 --> 23:19.899
during such uncertain times.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.902
Congresswoman Kimble Hookstraten.

23:25.571 --> 23:26.364
Hookstraten?

23:26.489 --> 23:29.075
Still think it was a good idea
to tell the truth at the interview?

23:30.076 --> 23:31.119
This isn't good.

23:31.244 --> 23:32.245
No.

23:33.371 --> 23:35.915
This is what you get
for being honest in D.C.

23:36.457 --> 23:37.792
Opportunism.

23:43.881 --> 23:47.218
And when he rose
from those pine thickets of Louisiana

23:47.343 --> 23:50.179
to the heights of power on the Potomac...

23:51.597 --> 23:53.015
my friend...

23:53.141 --> 23:54.809
Robert Richmond...

23:55.435 --> 24:00.314
never imagined that he'd be struck down
by the enemies of liberty.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.150
And I am reminded now...

24:02.859 --> 24:04.402
more than ever before...

24:05.653 --> 24:09.740
that a country of the people,
by the people and for...

24:09.866 --> 24:11.659
She's good, I'll give her that.

24:11.784 --> 24:14.245
She's so political
she doesn't even seem political.

24:14.370 --> 24:15.621
May God bless you...

24:16.414 --> 24:19.625
and God bless
the United States of America.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.318
Ma'am, I just got a call
from Leo's security detail.

24:45.443 --> 24:48.404
Your son had them take him
to 88 Hartford Drive.

24:48.529 --> 24:50.239
- Okay, thanks, Mike.
- Mr. President.

24:50.364 --> 24:52.492
Galvanizing speech, Congresswoman.

24:52.617 --> 24:53.659
Is something wrong, sir?

24:54.911 --> 24:56.370
No, not at all, Kimble.

24:57.038 --> 25:01.042
Republicans, Democrats, Independents...
We're all Americans today.

25:01.167 --> 25:02.668
Isn't that what you said?

25:05.796 --> 25:07.757
Ever since
that Elizabeth Vargas video came out,

25:07.882 --> 25:10.051
social media's been going crazy.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.512
The designated survivor
or designated deceiver?

25:13.346 --> 25:15.806
Hashtag BogusPOTUS. That one's trending.

25:15.932 --> 25:17.266
Listen to this from <i>The Washington Post--</i>

25:17.391 --> 25:19.393
"The Congresswoman's speech
was inspiring.

25:19.519 --> 25:21.771
Given that and the fact
that Kirkman was fired,

25:21.896 --> 25:23.856
is it possible the country's being led

25:23.981 --> 25:26.567
by the wrong designated survivor?"

25:37.578 --> 25:40.623
Wow. It's smaller than I remember.

25:40.748 --> 25:42.792
I'll be a second, Mike.

25:46.420 --> 25:47.672
Hey.

25:47.797 --> 25:49.173
I don't know.

25:49.298 --> 25:50.967
You don't know what?

25:51.801 --> 25:53.052
Why I did it.

25:53.177 --> 25:56.264
I mean, that's why you're here, right,
for... for an explanation?

25:56.389 --> 25:58.891
I mean, I wanted attention,
or I was acting out--

25:59.016 --> 25:59.934
Well, is that why?

26:00.059 --> 26:01.477
No, no! No.

26:01.602 --> 26:03.104
I told you, I--

26:03.229 --> 26:05.106
- You don't know.
- I don't know.

26:06.566 --> 26:07.900
I know... I know I screwed up,

26:08.025 --> 26:10.152
but sometimes people just...
just do stuff.

26:10.278 --> 26:11.487
There's not always a reason.

26:11.612 --> 26:13.864
No, I... I think there are reasons.

26:13.990 --> 26:15.992
I think the reason you came home today

26:16.117 --> 26:20.288
is the same reason that your dad and I
want to have a family dinner tonight,

26:20.413 --> 26:23.207
to hold on to who we were
before the Capitol blew up.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.167
Leo...

26:26.419 --> 26:28.296
The White House
did not cause our problems.

26:28.421 --> 26:30.548
We brought them with us.

26:33.426 --> 26:34.427
What about Dad?

26:35.386 --> 26:36.679
Did you tell him?

26:36.804 --> 26:37.888
Not yet.

26:41.517 --> 26:43.477
He'll be so upset.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.525
Dinner, 6:30, um...

26:50.610 --> 26:51.902
We'll deal with it then.

26:52.028 --> 26:53.487
Here.

26:57.158 --> 27:00.494
<i>Tyler, it's Tom Kirkman.
Please call me back. Thank you.</i>

27:00.620 --> 27:02.288
<i>...Congressman MacLeish
to address the media.</i>

27:02.413 --> 27:03.623
Bad time, sir?

27:03.748 --> 27:05.291
No, come on in.

27:06.584 --> 27:08.961
I think Tyler Richmond
is dodging my calls.

27:09.086 --> 27:10.755
I'm sorry about what happened.

27:10.880 --> 27:13.924
You wrote a beautiful eulogy.
I'm sorry he didn't get to hear it.

27:14.050 --> 27:15.509
Thank you, sir.

27:15.635 --> 27:17.094
There is one thing.

27:17.219 --> 27:20.514
After the funeral,
I ran into a couple of former staffers

27:20.640 --> 27:22.516
who were closer with the former President.

27:23.059 --> 27:24.518
They told me that Tyler and his father

27:24.644 --> 27:26.187
had a falling out two years ago.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.314
They hadn't spoken to each other since,
not a word.

27:28.439 --> 27:29.357
Wow...

27:31.317 --> 27:33.235
He didn't make it sound like that.

27:34.070 --> 27:36.989
I guess all any son wants
is to feel like he's loved by his father.

27:37.114 --> 27:40.993
Maybe it's just easier to lie to the world
than it is to be honest with yourself.

27:42.036 --> 27:43.245
Yeah.

27:44.497 --> 27:46.540
<i>We have breaking news now
from Washington, D.C.</i>

27:46.666 --> 27:50.252
<i>We've just received a video obtained
from a high-level White House source.</i>

27:50.378 --> 27:52.755
<i>The video shows Majid Nassar,</i>

27:52.880 --> 27:54.840
<i>the leader
of the Algerian-based Al-Sakar--</i>

27:54.965 --> 27:56.926
- Someone leaked it.
- Who? Cochrane?

27:57.051 --> 27:58.719
No, it's not his style.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.429
Wyatt, can you get me
Congresswoman Hookstraten?

28:00.554 --> 28:01.514
Now!

28:07.895 --> 28:10.439
Forgive me, sir,
but I did not leak that video.

28:10.564 --> 28:13.484
- I'm wondering why you think I did.
- Because you said to my face

28:13.609 --> 28:16.487
that we needed an enemy.
Well, now we've got one,

28:16.612 --> 28:18.406
and we both know you're not
above undermining me.

28:19.323 --> 28:21.283
Still holding my speech against me?

28:21.409 --> 28:23.452
Sorry, it's still a little fresh,

28:23.577 --> 28:26.872
and I can't help but notice
a pattern starting to develop.

28:26.997 --> 28:31.127
Mr. President, I was honest with you then,
and I'll be honest with you now.

28:31.252 --> 28:34.463
I did not release that video.

28:34.588 --> 28:35.923
But whoever did...

28:36.048 --> 28:37.883
was actually doing you a tremendous favor.

28:38.008 --> 28:40.636
- How on Earth is that possible?
- Just wait.

28:41.137 --> 28:43.597
In an hour or two,
the conversation won't be about

28:43.723 --> 28:45.808
whether you were fired
or if I gave a great speech.

28:45.933 --> 28:49.228
It'll be about the vicious
and ruthless enemy we're facing

28:49.353 --> 28:52.982
and how we should all rally
around our leader, Tom Kirkman.

28:53.107 --> 28:56.068
Even if we can't prove that they're
the group that actually attacked us!

28:56.193 --> 28:59.488
I'm sorry,
but that's out of your hands now, sir.

28:59.613 --> 29:01.991
You might not be ready for it,
but you are now truly

29:02.116 --> 29:03.951
our Commander-in-Chief.

29:12.710 --> 29:13.836
That'll be all.

29:16.422 --> 29:17.298
Kimble.

29:17.423 --> 29:18.674
Sir?

29:18.799 --> 29:21.010
Earlier, you said
that you didn't want this job.

29:21.135 --> 29:22.136
Was that the truth?

29:22.261 --> 29:23.387
Yes.

29:23.512 --> 29:24.472
For now.

29:25.973 --> 29:27.057
For now?

29:27.183 --> 29:28.642
What about three years?

29:28.768 --> 29:31.061
Well, with the primaries,
more like two and a half.

29:31.187 --> 29:32.104
But who's counting?

29:33.898 --> 29:35.191
Told you I was honest.

29:43.991 --> 29:45.034
You wanted to see me?

29:45.868 --> 29:47.536
Did you really think I wouldn't find out

29:47.661 --> 29:50.164
that you asked a data tech
to ignore the Fourth Amendment?

29:51.207 --> 29:54.418
Jason, our government's gone.
It can't be business as usual, can it?

29:54.543 --> 29:56.378
It can't be the Wild West, either.

29:56.504 --> 30:00.508
I've got agents
from every task force working 24/7.

30:00.633 --> 30:02.384
If you break the law...

30:02.843 --> 30:05.221
you jeopardize
all the work they've put in.

30:06.222 --> 30:07.097
You're right.

30:07.890 --> 30:08.933
I know.

30:09.517 --> 30:11.268
Whatever you want to do, I understand.

30:11.852 --> 30:13.187
Have a seat.

30:14.814 --> 30:18.400
The lab updated the list
of confirmed dead.

30:21.529 --> 30:24.740
One of those names
is Senator Scott Wheeler.

30:33.707 --> 30:34.917
I'm sorry.

30:36.210 --> 30:37.294
You knew?

30:38.838 --> 30:40.089
Come on, I work for the largest

30:40.214 --> 30:42.716
information-gathering organization
in the free world.

30:42.842 --> 30:44.802
What would that say about me if I didn't?

30:49.682 --> 30:51.267
We met a year ago.

30:52.893 --> 30:54.395
He wasn't happy.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.022
You know the story.

30:57.773 --> 30:59.775
He and his wife were splitting, or...

31:00.651 --> 31:02.653
or that's what I wanted to believe.

31:02.778 --> 31:04.363
This job is not easy.

31:05.114 --> 31:08.617
We all need someone to...
care if we make it home at night.

31:08.742 --> 31:12.037
So... forgive yourself for that.

31:12.705 --> 31:15.791
I'm sorry. I went too far.

31:15.916 --> 31:17.543
No.

31:18.460 --> 31:20.045
You made a bad call.

31:22.673 --> 31:24.091
But from now on,

31:24.216 --> 31:26.552
I want only good ones.

31:26.677 --> 31:27.970
Can you do that?

31:31.599 --> 31:32.558
Yeah.

31:33.183 --> 31:35.477
We're tracking a shift
among major news outlets.

31:35.603 --> 31:38.314
They're now focusing almost exclusively
on Al-Sakar's confession.

31:38.439 --> 31:40.482
Social media's showing the same trend.

31:41.108 --> 31:42.902
Yeah, it seems like we're back online.

31:44.111 --> 31:45.905
Guys, this is what I call a win-win.

31:46.030 --> 31:47.740
Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt.

31:47.865 --> 31:49.033
Please, sit.

31:49.158 --> 31:51.577
- Aaron, can I see you for a moment?
- Yes, sir.

31:52.161 --> 31:54.121
All right, guys. Keep me posted.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.457
Sir, the media's moving
in the right direction now.

31:56.582 --> 31:59.585
Now that video,
it changed the entire narrative.

31:59.710 --> 32:01.420
I know it was you.

32:04.131 --> 32:05.299
Sir?

32:05.424 --> 32:07.593
I know you were the one
who released the video.

32:12.222 --> 32:13.849
Sir, you were on the ropes.

32:13.974 --> 32:16.352
The country was nervous.
The press was circling.

32:16.477 --> 32:17.269
Aaron, please.

32:17.394 --> 32:20.481
Nobody is talking about
the wrong designated survivor anymore.

32:20.606 --> 32:23.108
They're rallying against a common enemy,

32:23.233 --> 32:25.861
and soon they'll unite
behind their Commander-in-Chief.

32:25.986 --> 32:28.405
I don't know
if we've even got the right target yet.

32:28.530 --> 32:30.532
I'm not ready to declare war.

32:30.658 --> 32:33.452
All due respect, sir,
that's a decision you can only make

32:33.577 --> 32:34.703
if you remain President,

32:34.828 --> 32:37.081
and it didn't look likely six hours ago.

32:37.206 --> 32:39.917
What you did wasn't just duplicitous...

32:40.042 --> 32:41.168
or cynical.

32:41.710 --> 32:44.129
It was directly insubordinate.

32:48.676 --> 32:51.387
Sir, perhaps you've noticed
you're surrounded by people

32:51.512 --> 32:53.138
who would love to see you fail.

32:55.349 --> 32:57.309
I want to help you succeed.

32:58.686 --> 33:00.562
Sir, I want to help you thrive.

33:01.689 --> 33:03.649
What I did was a bold move.

33:04.149 --> 33:05.567
I admit it.

33:07.027 --> 33:09.154
And I believe it was the best one.

33:10.531 --> 33:12.241
If you can't see it that way...

33:15.828 --> 33:17.997
...here's my letter of resignation.

33:19.748 --> 33:22.751
You can accept it at any time
if you so choose.

33:43.397 --> 33:45.733
- Mr. President, Tyler Richmond.
- Thank you.

33:48.318 --> 33:49.987
Why am I here?

33:50.446 --> 33:51.905
Please, have a seat.

33:57.745 --> 33:59.830
I feel I owe you an apology...

34:01.123 --> 34:04.376
because I agreed to have you brought over
to the West Wing earlier today

34:04.501 --> 34:05.961
to tell stories about your father

34:06.086 --> 34:08.422
for the eulogy
that I was supposed to deliver.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.674
It was insensitive, and I am sorry.

34:11.425 --> 34:12.801
But I remembered...

34:13.635 --> 34:15.429
that I actually have a story for you.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.222
Oh, like the time my dad fired you?

34:17.347 --> 34:20.184
No. No.

34:20.309 --> 34:23.728
This was when your father took
almost an hour out of a Cabinet meeting

34:23.853 --> 34:25.938
to tell us all about your spring recital

34:26.065 --> 34:27.690
at Williams last year.

34:27.815 --> 34:29.902
No, I think... I think you're mistaken.

34:30.027 --> 34:33.197
Bartók, <i>Violin Concerto No. 2,</i>
I think.

34:33.322 --> 34:35.364
Yeah, but my... my father wasn't there.

34:35.491 --> 34:36.658
- He had a Cabinet--
- He was...

34:37.534 --> 34:38.659
in the back of the room.

34:40.161 --> 34:41.121
I think I would know.

34:41.246 --> 34:44.625
He had one Secret Service detail.
He was wearing a baseball cap.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.668
He didn't want
to take the focus off of you.

34:46.793 --> 34:50.339
- No, that's just not--
- He went on and on about your craft,

34:50.464 --> 34:53.467
your diligence, your work ethic,
your talent, and...

34:55.385 --> 34:56.969
he was so proud.

35:00.307 --> 35:01.350
It was nice.

35:02.476 --> 35:05.312
And at the end,
he gave everyone a program.

35:06.313 --> 35:07.564
I asked my assistant Wyatt

35:07.689 --> 35:10.609
to go to my old office
and bring it here for me.

35:18.117 --> 35:19.243
He was...

35:19.993 --> 35:21.370
He was there?

35:24.623 --> 35:27.126
Tyler, I think he was always there.

35:33.132 --> 35:35.134
I'm sorry he couldn't tell you himself.

35:37.928 --> 35:38.762
Um...

35:40.097 --> 35:42.850
Would you, um... mind if I--

35:42.975 --> 35:44.852
That would be my honor.

35:44.977 --> 35:46.228
It's why I asked you here.

35:51.441 --> 35:52.317
Um...

35:53.777 --> 35:54.653
Thank you...

35:56.071 --> 35:57.156
Mr. President.

35:58.574 --> 35:59.658
My pleasure.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.930
Yeah, Chuck, what is it?

36:22.055 --> 36:24.725
<i>Hey, I've been looking
at the feed from the State of the Union.</i>

36:24.850 --> 36:25.809
<i>You gotta get over here.</i>

36:25.934 --> 36:27.102
I'm on my way.

36:32.816 --> 36:33.942
<i>You wanted to see me?</i>

36:34.610 --> 36:35.402
Emily!

36:35.527 --> 36:37.237
Please, have a seat.

36:39.448 --> 36:41.575
Telling the truth earlier today
might not have been

36:41.700 --> 36:43.202
the most savvy thing to do...

36:44.077 --> 36:45.495
But it felt right.

36:45.621 --> 36:48.457
It's who I am.
It's the kind of President I need to be.

36:48.582 --> 36:50.209
I feel the same way.

36:51.043 --> 36:53.045
I've been thinking
about my Chief of Staff.

36:54.379 --> 36:55.505
Have you?

36:56.548 --> 36:58.967
And I guess
I should just come right out with it.

36:59.760 --> 37:01.470
I have decided to go with Aaron.

37:03.055 --> 37:04.473
I'm sorry?

37:04.598 --> 37:07.100
I know you have misgivings about Aaron.
Hell, so do I.

37:08.060 --> 37:09.686
But I need someone political,

37:09.811 --> 37:11.730
someone who can think differently
than I do.

37:11.855 --> 37:13.482
- I can be that!
- Emily...

37:13.607 --> 37:14.608
I need you...

37:15.317 --> 37:16.652
to be you.

37:18.028 --> 37:19.446
- Right.
- I need you to know

37:19.571 --> 37:21.490
that I cannot do this without you.

37:22.366 --> 37:24.701
You have been by my side
since I began in public service.

37:24.826 --> 37:27.663
It's always been you and me
off to fight the good fight.

37:27.788 --> 37:29.081
But this...

37:29.206 --> 37:32.542
This is beyond anything
anyone could have expected.

37:35.254 --> 37:36.838
And the truth is, I'm scared.

37:39.091 --> 37:40.884
I'm scared I'm going to fail...

37:42.386 --> 37:44.972
fail our nation at this crucial time.

37:45.097 --> 37:47.599
I would like to appoint you
as my Special Adviser.

37:47.724 --> 37:49.351
It's not a consolation.

37:49.476 --> 37:51.311
You would have full access.

37:51.436 --> 37:53.105
Please.

37:58.318 --> 37:59.820
I would be honored.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.697
For the record,
I'm not here to smile and nod.

38:01.822 --> 38:03.740
If I disagree with Aaron,
I'm gonna say it.

38:04.741 --> 38:06.326
I would expect nothing less.

38:08.412 --> 38:09.830
Thank you...

38:10.706 --> 38:12.332
Mr. President.

38:20.924 --> 38:22.342
Family dinner.

38:22.467 --> 38:24.386
Damn it.

38:41.820 --> 38:42.821
It suits you...

38:44.406 --> 38:45.866
The office.

38:45.991 --> 38:48.410
Congratulations, really.

38:48.535 --> 38:50.037
No hard feelings?

38:50.162 --> 38:51.913
I'm sure I can hunt down a couple glasses.

38:52.039 --> 38:53.498
I should get home.

38:53.623 --> 38:55.834
Hey, so I get a job, you get a fiancé.

38:55.959 --> 38:58.003
You're probably the real winner here.

38:59.880 --> 39:01.006
I said no.

39:02.341 --> 39:05.344
Post-disaster acceleration
isn't the right reason to get married.

39:05.469 --> 39:06.970
I... I didn't mean that.

39:07.095 --> 39:07.971
No, you were right.

39:08.096 --> 39:10.098
At least I won't be late to work again.

39:11.350 --> 39:12.684
I didn't mean that, either.

39:14.227 --> 39:17.230
But, Aaron,
just don't get too comfortable,

39:17.356 --> 39:19.816
because Chiefs of Staff
get replaced all the time.

39:22.444 --> 39:23.612
Night.

39:47.803 --> 39:49.429
Hi, Daddy.

39:49.554 --> 39:50.847
Hey!

39:51.390 --> 39:53.100
Come here.

39:54.851 --> 39:55.894
Hey!

39:56.645 --> 39:58.480
What are you doing up so late?

39:58.605 --> 40:00.065
Hmm?

40:00.190 --> 40:01.608
We waited up for you.

40:01.733 --> 40:02.567
Hey.

40:02.692 --> 40:04.277
Where's Leo?

40:04.403 --> 40:06.571
I said he could stay over
at a friend's house tonight.

40:06.696 --> 40:07.572
Oh...

40:07.697 --> 40:08.740
On a school night?

40:11.868 --> 40:14.496
Was that the thing
you didn't want to tell me earlier?

40:14.621 --> 40:16.623
- Yeah.
- Oh.

40:17.416 --> 40:18.583
Actually, um, I...

40:19.543 --> 40:20.669
I changed my mind.

40:20.794 --> 40:22.212
Hey.

40:26.800 --> 40:27.801
Family dinner, right?

40:27.926 --> 40:29.261
Mm-hmm.

40:29.970 --> 40:30.887
Yeah.

40:37.936 --> 40:40.689
<i>First you get me in trouble,
now you want to help me?</i>

40:40.814 --> 40:42.649
Truth is, I never liked Orders to Compel,

40:42.774 --> 40:44.443
and I think you're kind of badass.

40:44.943 --> 40:45.735
What do you got?

40:45.861 --> 40:47.946
Okay, so I hacked the woman's cloud,
and you were right.

40:48.071 --> 40:50.323
She took two photos between the time
the feed cut

40:50.449 --> 40:52.701
- and the time of the explosion.
- The missing 34 seconds?

40:52.826 --> 40:53.785
- Yeah.
- Show me.

40:53.910 --> 40:56.204
And Congressman MacLeish
in his seat--

40:56.329 --> 40:58.123
- Chuck, I've seen this.
- Wait for it.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.085
This photo was taken six seconds later.

41:08.467 --> 41:12.929
I can't tell you what happened that night,
how they did it, why.

41:13.054 --> 41:15.390
But I can tell you MacLeish survived...

41:16.308 --> 41:17.601
Because he wasn't there.

41:26.276 --> 41:27.819
Aaron Shore.

41:27.944 --> 41:29.112
Aaron, it's me.

41:29.237 --> 41:30.864
<i>Mr. President.</i>

41:31.323 --> 41:34.326
You forced my hand today
by releasing that tape.

41:34.451 --> 41:35.994
You put in motion a timetable

41:36.119 --> 41:38.830
that will test
the patience of the American people.

41:38.955 --> 41:42.209
So, your first job as my Chief of Staff

41:42.334 --> 41:45.921
<i>is to make sure that Al-Sakar is found,
and fast...</i>

41:46.671 --> 41:49.216
or you may find my patience being tested.

41:49.341 --> 41:51.259
- Are we clear?
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

41:51.384 --> 41:53.720
- Good night, Mr. President.
<i>- Good night.</i>

41:57.307 --> 41:59.768
He's an interesting guy, your boss.

41:59.893 --> 42:01.895
I have what you asked for.

42:08.568 --> 42:09.361
Anything good?

42:09.486 --> 42:11.321
Depends whose side you're on.
