somebody a pedophile.

she wants to leave, I'm leaving.

00:26.926 --> 00:29.662

she was selling her vagina

- You're laughing already.
- Is that really true?

01:29.322 --> 01:31.057

And for Cate and her husband

01:31.124 --> 01:33.059
{\an3}Tyler they dealt
with a lot of struggles,

01:33.126 --> 01:34.427

was Cate's battle

01:34.494 --> 01:36.095
with depression

- Thanks.
- Being willing to be

03:21.935 --> 03:25.338

What took you to that point?

03:25.405 --> 03:28.241
When did you know you needed to
do something more significant?

03:28.308 --> 03:30.176
- I'm so stupid when I say it,
that it took me a pig

03:30.243 --> 03:33.012
{\an1}to realize
that I'm impulsive on things

03:33.079 --> 03:36.516
because I want to fill
a void in myself.

- You still have that void?
- I mean, I'm sure I do yeah,

03:40.420 --> 03:42.822
but I think it's just
figuring out ways to fill it

03:42.889 --> 03:45.325
in healthier ways
such as going horseback riding,

03:45.391 --> 03:47.860
or getting a massage,
or spending quality time

03:47.927 --> 03:49.996
with Nova, like, doing things
that I enjoy to do

03:50.063 --> 03:51.931
and then it's like
taking care of yourself

03:51.998 --> 03:54.067
before you can take care
of anybody else.

03:54.133 --> 03:56.769

taking care of your mom, right?

- Everybody, yeah.
- And everybody, really.

04:00.306 --> 04:02.675
I've always been
that nurturing type of person.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.078
- And so what are you doing
to nurture yourself,

04:05.144 --> 04:07.513
to take care of yourself?
- Like I said--

04:07.580 --> 04:09.716
- I saw Tyler saying you didn't
go to the aftercare plan.

04:09.782 --> 04:11.918
- Right, but no I am going
to therapy,

04:11.985 --> 04:13.286
and I am seeing my psychiatrist,

04:13.353 --> 04:16.755
doing talk therapy,
seeing my psychiatrist

04:16.822 --> 04:20.125
and I've been on the ball with
that and, like, sticking to it.

04:20.192 --> 04:22.060
- And that's helping?
- Yeah.

04:22.128 --> 04:24.364
- Was it tough
to reenter your normal life?

04:24.430 --> 04:25.898
- Yeah, I didn't think
it would be,

04:25.965 --> 04:27.934
but I think it was like
a culture shock of getting out

04:28.001 --> 04:29.402
and it's like you don't,

04:29.469 --> 04:30.937
you know, you don't have
all that structure.

04:31.004 --> 04:34.073
You have to create it
and it definitely was weird

04:34.140 --> 04:36.776
and then of course
getting out of treatment

04:36.843 --> 04:38.277
and you get in a van
and you're already

04:38.344 --> 04:40.546
surrounded by cameras again.
- And then you get home

04:40.613 --> 04:43.383
and things start kind of sliding
back it seemed like.

04:43.449 --> 04:45.652
I just see your family
complaining a lot about things

04:45.718 --> 04:48.087
{\an3}and they're getting on your case
about smoking pot.

04:48.154 --> 04:52.325
- Mm-hmm.
- What was happening?

04:52.392 --> 04:55.962
- You know, I mean,
just still trying to figure out

04:56.029 --> 04:57.463
what's going on
in this mind of mine.

04:57.530 --> 04:58.831
- What is going on?

04:58.898 --> 05:00.466
- 'Cause I'm mentally
[bleep] up.

05:00.533 --> 05:02.468
- I don't know about that.

05:02.535 --> 05:06.439
- I feel like I am.
- In what way?

05:06.506 --> 05:09.575
- Just that I'm always
gonna have these downs

05:09.642 --> 05:11.577
and when they're down
it's really bad

05:11.644 --> 05:13.646
and I don't want to deal
with that forever.

05:13.713 --> 05:14.647
- One of the things
that cannabis

05:14.714 --> 05:16.949
does is cause panic attacks.

05:17.016 --> 05:18.484
- I know, I hear that
all the time.

05:18.551 --> 05:20.253
- It's not helping you.
It's not helping you.

05:20.319 --> 05:22.321
- I know. I know this.

05:22.388 --> 05:23.523
- And how long were you
abstinent?

05:23.589 --> 05:26.426
How long were you
actually sober?

05:26.492 --> 05:29.128
- Like, 40 days?

05:29.195 --> 05:31.698
- And you see, you
looked vibrant during that time.

05:31.764 --> 05:34.133
You looked great.
- Mm-hmm, my thing though is,

05:34.200 --> 05:37.003
Dr. Drew, is if I'm having
a severe panic attack

05:37.070 --> 05:40.206
and I'm doing everything that
I can to try to get out of it

05:40.273 --> 05:42.208
and all that stuff,
personally for me

05:42.275 --> 05:44.110
I'd rather hit a pin
then take a Xanax

05:44.177 --> 05:45.344
and be a zombie and go to bed.

05:45.411 --> 05:46.879
- But there are other things
to do,

05:46.946 --> 05:49.482
there are other alternatives
I'm just saying.

05:49.549 --> 05:52.652
Also Ty seemed like he was
giving you some sort of tough...

05:52.719 --> 05:53.653

06:20.413 --> 06:22.315
- Hard. Yeah.
- Why?

06:22.381 --> 06:24.117
{\an1}- What people don't realize
is that living

06:24.183 --> 06:25.785
with this as a spouse

06:25.852 --> 06:29.989
{\an1}and watching your significant
other, it's exhausting.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.958
{\an1}Do I get frustrated?
Yeah.

06:32.024 --> 06:34.093
{\an1}Was I stressed out?
Absolutely.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.596
I was trying
to just manage everything

06:36.662 --> 06:38.531
while she was
going through all of her stuff,

06:38.598 --> 06:40.366
{\an1}like, just trying to keep
everything together,

06:40.433 --> 06:42.869
Nova's okay, Cate's,
you know, doing her--

06:42.935 --> 06:44.370
{\an1}I'm just trying
to balance everything out.

06:44.437 --> 06:46.606
And it was just hard
because it was like,

06:46.672 --> 06:48.775
{\an1}I never knew how to do it
before, you know, so--

06:48.841 --> 06:51.778

{\an3}one was doing

06:55.381 --> 06:56.482
{\an1}- Yeah.

06:56.549 --> 06:58.017
{\an3}- Do you still
have that concern?

06:58.084 --> 06:59.152
{\an1}- Yeah, yeah I mean
it's still a legitimate concern.

06:59.218 --> 07:02.522
{\an1}I think not because,
you know,

07:02.588 --> 07:03.856
{\an1}because of what
they told her to do.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.491
{\an1}I mean, she did get
clearance saying, you know,

07:05.558 --> 07:08.361
{\an1}you're fine to do your,
you know, your once a week--

07:08.427 --> 07:09.996
- As long as you're
doing talk therapy.

07:10.062 --> 07:11.364
{\an1}- Yeah, as long as you're doing
talk therapy, you know...

07:11.430 --> 07:12.465
- Psychiatrist.
- And seeing your psychiatrist

07:12.532 --> 07:14.567
we think that that's
the best thing to do.

07:14.634 --> 07:17.003
- So there was a lot
of social media stuff

07:17.069 --> 07:18.704
directed at you guys this year.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.039
- Holy [bleep].

07:20.106 --> 07:21.374
- Tell me about that.
- Yeah, there was.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.009
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I'm a fat shamer,

07:23.075 --> 07:24.477
you make her depressed,

07:24.544 --> 07:26.546
{\an1}why are you speaking
to her like that?

07:26.612 --> 07:28.815
{\an1}But the thing about that whole
comment, that whole conversation

07:28.881 --> 07:32.151
{\an1}was that they also didn't show
was that they were all laughing.

07:32.218 --> 07:33.719
So it wasn't like a--

07:33.786 --> 07:35.822
- A big, serious, like--
- Yeah, and then Catelynn's like

07:35.888 --> 07:37.423
"well I don't want a heifer
as a husband, either,

07:37.490 --> 07:39.425
{\an1}so there you go."
I mean, some people don't like

07:39.492 --> 07:42.662
{\an1}skinny, scrawny, 12-year-old
built dudes like me,

07:42.728 --> 07:44.363
{\an1}so I mean that's just life,
you know,

07:44.430 --> 07:45.665
people got preferences.

07:45.731 --> 07:48.100
- Do you want to address it,
apologize?

07:48.167 --> 07:51.070
I know you tried to explain it.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.672
- I'm not a fat shamer.

07:52.738 --> 07:54.707
I do love my wife very much.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.609
I do not want a divorce.

07:56.676 --> 07:58.878
{\an1}I'm not the reason
she's depressed.

07:58.945 --> 08:00.713
- Is that true?
- Very.

08:00.780 --> 08:03.249
{\an3}- Last, your anniversary I think
it was you were talking again

08:03.316 --> 08:05.084
about having another child?

08:05.151 --> 08:06.586
- He was.
- He was, you're not?

08:06.652 --> 08:07.854
- I was.
- Not me.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.121
- Not her.
- That's it?

08:09.188 --> 08:11.190
- I could be one and done.
- You think?

08:11.257 --> 08:12.725
Is that you too, Tyler?

08:12.792 --> 08:13.793
- No, I mean it's, like...
- Not one and done.

08:13.860 --> 08:16.629
- I'm satisfied, I could be.

08:16.696 --> 08:18.297
{\an3}But then again I think
it's also fear of, like,

08:18.364 --> 08:21.100
do you want to have
post-partum again?

08:21.167 --> 08:22.702
{\an3}- But you're being treated now.
I mean that could be managed.

08:22.768 --> 08:24.036
{\an1}- I know, but it could
always come back.

08:24.103 --> 08:25.771
- It can--
- And I heard a statistic that

08:25.838 --> 08:27.607
if you have it once, most likely
you're gonna have it again.

08:27.673 --> 08:29.709
{\an3}- Yeah, but it could be managed.
You weren't treated.

08:29.775 --> 08:31.244
- No, yeah.
- You get treated,

08:31.310 --> 08:33.880
and I think Tyler
wants a son I'm picking up.

08:33.946 --> 08:35.715
{\an1}- Yeah, hell yeah I want
a boy, man.

08:35.780 --> 08:38.251
- I told him with his luck
it's gonna be another girl.

08:38.317 --> 08:39.784
{\an1}- It will be, too,
with all my luck

08:39.852 --> 08:40.586
{\an1}but that's not
for a long time...

08:40.653 --> 08:42.455
{\an3}- No.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.490
{\an1}- We've got a lot of emotional
bull[bleep] to figure out.

08:44.557 --> 08:46.325
{\an3}- Well no,
and Nova's still little,

08:46.392 --> 08:47.894
{\an3}and I want to spend
time with her.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.929
- When was the last time
you saw Carly?

08:49.996 --> 08:51.898
- It's been a little
over a year.

08:51.964 --> 08:54.600
{\an3}- Ooh, so Teresa wants you
not even to discuss the story?

08:54.667 --> 08:55.835
{\an1}- No.

08:55.902 --> 08:57.103
- Well, that's what
we thought at first.

08:57.169 --> 08:58.571
- That's what we thought
at first.

08:58.638 --> 08:59.906
- Then we got clarification
afterwards saying that no,

08:59.972 --> 09:01.474
{\an1}you can do that,
just don't repeat--

09:01.540 --> 09:03.309
{\an3}- She just didn't like
the fact that

09:03.376 --> 09:04.310
I'd be having
a conversation with her

09:04.377 --> 09:05.611
and she didn't want it filmed...

09:05.678 --> 09:07.413
- Ah.
- And then I'd go in a room

09:07.480 --> 09:08.581
and my producer'd be like,
"So what'd you talk about?

09:08.648 --> 09:09.949
What'd she ask you?"
- And then, yeah.

09:10.016 --> 09:11.584
{\an3}- And I'd be like
"Oh, she said this"

09:11.651 --> 09:12.652
{\an3}and then she sees it later
and she's like "listen,

09:12.718 --> 09:14.086
{\an3}if I wanted the whole world
to know about it

09:14.153 --> 09:15.655
{\an3}I would let
the whole world know about it."

09:15.721 --> 09:17.123
{\an3}You know?
So she's basically

09:17.189 --> 09:18.624
{\an3}"Whatever I tell you in private,
keep it private."

09:18.691 --> 09:20.426
- And the paperwork you signed
for the adoption,

09:20.493 --> 09:21.761
did you really understand

09:21.827 --> 09:23.496
what you were getting
into at the time?

09:23.562 --> 09:24.997
- Yeah, I did.
- You understood it fully?

09:25.064 --> 09:26.766
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

09:26.832 --> 09:27.967
- And it's played out
to your satisfaction?

09:28.034 --> 09:30.636
{\an1}- Yeah. Well, honestly
our original thing

09:30.703 --> 09:32.638
that we filled out
was somewhat open,

09:32.705 --> 09:35.341
no face to face visits, no...

09:35.408 --> 09:36.475
{\an3}- That's what
I wanted back then.

09:36.542 --> 09:37.944
- That's what we thought as,

09:38.010 --> 09:39.278
{\an1}you know,
being 15 year old kids, yeah.

09:39.345 --> 09:40.212
- At 16 we thought
it'd be too hard.

09:40.279 --> 09:41.614
- Yeah, right.
- So--

09:41.681 --> 09:42.715
{\an3}- And it's like, but once,
you know,

09:42.782 --> 09:43.883
{\an3}she was born and we held her
in the hospital

09:43.950 --> 09:45.184
{\an3}it's like,
we changed our mind.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.385
- Well,
and what are you saying?

09:46.452 --> 09:49.121
{\an3}You're not happy
how it turned out?

09:49.188 --> 09:50.957
- I mean, not really, no.
- No.

09:51.023 --> 09:53.559
- Is it possible that
it's better for Carly this way?

09:53.626 --> 09:55.561
And Teresa is just trying
to make it based

09:55.628 --> 09:57.964
on her instinct as a mom?
- Yes.

09:58.030 --> 09:59.865
- I could definitely think so.
- I think so.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.367
- So isn't that really
what you want?

10:01.434 --> 10:02.501
Is what's best for Carly?
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

10:02.568 --> 10:03.903
- Exactly.
That's why we're not--

10:03.970 --> 10:05.571
- So even though you wish
it were different.

10:05.638 --> 10:06.572
{\an1}- Yeah, that's why we're not,
like, you know...

10:06.639 --> 10:08.741
- Not upset. Yeah.
- Mad or anything.

10:08.808 --> 10:09.709
{\an1}- Freaking out or anything,
'cause I totally get it.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.243
- 'Cause I understand it.

10:11.310 --> 10:13.045
{\an3}I mean, you know,
it's like she idolizes us.

10:13.112 --> 10:15.681
The last time she saw us I was
in this awesome, beautiful gown

10:15.748 --> 10:17.249
{\an3}and getting married
and I was like a princess and...

10:17.316 --> 10:19.518
- I think it was just very,
like, for her as a little,

10:19.585 --> 10:20.820
I mean, she's only--
- Too much?

10:20.886 --> 10:22.321
{\an1}- Yeah, I mean
she's only six years old.

10:22.388 --> 10:24.323
- You know, they always say
the grass is greener

10:24.390 --> 10:24.924
on the other side 'cause she
doesn't know what it's like.

10:24.991 --> 10:26.392
You know?
- Right.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.660
- That type of thing.
So, I think that's hard

10:27.727 --> 10:29.095
for them as parents.
- Are Teresa and Brandon taking

10:29.161 --> 10:31.030
the advice of professionals,
is that what?

10:31.097 --> 10:32.331
- I think so, 'cause I know
that she's seeing--she's--

10:32.398 --> 10:33.733
- Okay, so good.
- Yeah.

10:33.799 --> 10:36.002
- So, Tyler?
- Yeah?

10:36.068 --> 10:38.371
- Butch?
- Good old Butch.

10:38.437 --> 10:40.272
- What the hell?
- What the hell?

10:40.339 --> 10:42.942
- So you give him
a one year cake,

10:43.009 --> 10:43.943
and then what happened?

10:44.010 --> 10:46.112
- He was doing fine I guess

10:46.178 --> 10:49.048
and then he missed
a parole meeting

10:49.115 --> 10:52.918
and his parole officer
wanted to violate him so,

10:52.985 --> 10:55.921
now he's in jail and--

10:55.988 --> 10:57.390
{\an3}- We haven't talked
to him though really,

10:57.456 --> 10:59.759
{\an3}so we don't even know
really what is going on.

10:59.825 --> 11:03.129
- I'm also wondering with him if
living outside of an institution

11:03.195 --> 11:04.897
is part of the problem.
- I think that is.

11:04.964 --> 11:06.432
That without--'cause listen,

11:06.499 --> 11:07.767
{\an1}he's supposed to be off
of parole in 90 days.

11:07.833 --> 11:08.934
{\an3}- He was supposed
to go off in 90 days.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.469
{\an1}- He came back
from his parole meeting

11:10.536 --> 11:11.937
the week before all excited...
- All excited.

11:12.004 --> 11:13.939
{\an1}- Proud of himself "Oh, my God,
I'm gonna be off in 90 days."

11:14.006 --> 11:16.308
- And then boom.
- And then it's almost like

11:16.375 --> 11:19.378
he's afraid of his own freedom.
I know exactly what's going on.

11:19.445 --> 11:22.148
- What's going on?
- I think he's using.

11:22.214 --> 11:24.583
I think he used
or he relapsed or--

11:24.650 --> 11:27.420
- Or he was close?
- Yeah, because I saw some signs

11:27.486 --> 11:29.588
before this happened,
like, he was, like...

11:29.655 --> 11:30.823
- Not--
- Sleeping in later--

11:30.890 --> 11:31.991
- Not really coming home a lot.

11:32.058 --> 11:35.161
{\an1}- Not coming home a lot,
you know, just--

11:35.227 --> 11:37.229
{\an3}- Don't we sound
like the parents again?

11:37.296 --> 11:38.831
- It's hard, though.

11:38.898 --> 11:39.999
{\an3}It's, you know, everyone fell
in love with Butch.

11:40.066 --> 11:41.067
{\an1}- I know, we are.
Look at us here again.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.601
- Like, "he wasn't coming home!"

11:42.668 --> 11:43.903
- No, but you're right.

11:43.969 --> 11:45.237
{\an3}All right,
well I'm gonna move on,

11:45.304 --> 11:46.772
and I also want to remind people

11:46.839 --> 11:48.941
that you will be able
to follow what happens with

11:49.008 --> 11:53.279
Butch when new episodes
of "Teen Mom OG" air next year.

11:53.345 --> 11:55.948
So coming up here I'm gonna
speak with Cate's mother

11:56.015 --> 11:57.616
to get her views on this season.

11:57.683 --> 12:02.421
<i>♪</i> ♪

12:06.592 --> 12:09.261
[applause]

12:11.330 --> 12:12.698
- Hey, I'm here now with Cate,

12:12.765 --> 12:15.367
Ty,
and Catelynn's mother April.

12:15.434 --> 12:18.537
And you guys are in a pretty
good place these days, yeah?

12:18.604 --> 12:20.106
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah?

12:20.172 --> 12:23.776
- No. No, just kidding.
- But I know one of the things

12:23.843 --> 12:25.344
that Cate's getting into now
in treatment

12:25.411 --> 12:27.546
is some of the traumatic
feelings from childhood,

12:27.613 --> 12:29.014
is that hard for you to hear?

12:29.081 --> 12:31.350
{\an1}- Some of it, yeah,
some what I--

12:31.417 --> 12:33.319
some of the things I've heard.
- What stuff?

12:33.385 --> 12:35.521
{\an1}- Mostly her feeling abandoned
by her dad, that bothers me.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.790
I don't like her
feeling that way.

12:37.857 --> 12:41.727
- Is that the main trauma
you feel bad about?

12:41.794 --> 12:44.063
{\an1}- Yeah. I don't know what
I'm supposed to feel

12:44.130 --> 12:46.398
bad about, but sure.

12:46.465 --> 12:48.567
{\an3}- Well, Catelynn, and you're
such a caretaker, right?

12:48.634 --> 12:50.236
And I'm surprised
you're even able to open up

12:50.302 --> 12:51.537
about these things out of fear

12:51.604 --> 12:53.205
{\an3}of how your mom's
gonna feel about it.

12:53.272 --> 12:54.974
{\an1}- No, we worked way
past that I feel.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.308
- That's what I'm hoping.

12:56.375 --> 12:57.843
{\an3}I mean, what I was gonna have
to ask you

12:57.910 --> 13:00.312
was you certainly
give her permission

13:00.379 --> 13:01.914
to bring up anything
if it helps her, right?

13:01.981 --> 13:04.884
- Oh, well yeah of course, yeah.
- Yeah, does that still--

13:04.950 --> 13:07.386
do you still feel like that?

13:07.453 --> 13:09.889
{\an1}- I think that when she was
in treatment and we went

13:09.955 --> 13:12.158
{\an1}and did the week with her,
we did a week with her and--

13:12.224 --> 13:13.425
- Family treatment?
- Yeah.

13:13.492 --> 13:15.728
{\an1}- Family treatment,
and she got to say things,

13:15.794 --> 13:17.696
{\an1}and we weren't allowed
to respond

13:17.763 --> 13:19.865
{\an1}and we just got to think
about those

13:19.932 --> 13:21.667
and still haven't responded.

13:21.734 --> 13:23.869
- Still thinking about them?
- Still thinking about them.

13:23.936 --> 13:27.339
- And any surprises for you?
- Not really. I mean, a lot--

13:27.406 --> 13:30.409
{\an1}- Yeah, he leaves
his towels out all the time.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.545
{\an3}- That was one of the--
and I asked Cate,

13:32.611 --> 13:34.613
I said "why did you say
something about the towels?"

13:34.680 --> 13:36.081
And she's like "I couldn't
think of anything."

13:36.148 --> 13:37.216
- I couldn't think of one more
other thing

13:37.283 --> 13:40.085
that annoyed me about you.

13:40.152 --> 13:44.590
- But there was one thing where
I realize that my temper can--

13:44.657 --> 13:47.560
or my--when I get angry
about something.

13:47.626 --> 13:49.261
- How it affects me.
- Or how it--if I get passionate

13:49.328 --> 13:51.397
about something and,
you know, that it--she--

13:51.463 --> 13:53.465
- It's like a trigger.
- It's a trigger for her

13:53.532 --> 13:55.034
and that she wants
to immediately either, like...

13:55.100 --> 13:57.570
- Leave.
- Calm me down, fix me,

13:57.636 --> 13:59.772
{\an3}help care take for me
and make it all better,

13:59.838 --> 14:03.108
or she wants to just, like,
freeze up and leave and so--

14:03.175 --> 14:06.478
- She shuts down?
- I think to me personally

14:06.545 --> 14:08.280
it's almost like Catelynn
sometimes will internalize it,

14:08.347 --> 14:09.582
like, she is the reason

14:09.648 --> 14:11.050
why I'm mad,

14:11.116 --> 14:13.252
or she's the reason
why, you know,

14:13.319 --> 14:15.487
this frustrated me
or something like that.

14:15.554 --> 14:18.224
- April, sober yourself?
- Yeah.

14:18.290 --> 14:19.558
- Program?
- No.

14:19.625 --> 14:22.261
- No. How do you stay sober?
- Stay at home.

14:22.328 --> 14:24.396
- Stay at home?
- Stay at home.

14:24.463 --> 14:26.098
{\an3}- There's lots--
these guys use at home.

14:26.165 --> 14:27.733
{\an3}There's all kind of stuff,
and by the way,

14:27.800 --> 14:30.469
what's with the wine
for your sober wife?

14:30.536 --> 14:31.670
- What?
- Weren't you toasting her

14:31.737 --> 14:32.671
on your anniversary or?

14:32.738 --> 14:34.440
- Yeah.
- Hm.

14:34.506 --> 14:37.243
- So let's redefine sobriety...
- I like me a glass of wine.

14:37.309 --> 14:39.111
- Let's, like,
figure out, because...

14:39.178 --> 14:40.579
- If you--what if Butch?

14:40.646 --> 14:42.748
- If I remember--
- What if Butch had a drink?

14:42.815 --> 14:45.618
- That wouldn't be good.
- Right.

14:45.684 --> 14:47.953
{\an3}- Right, but
my dad is an addict.

14:48.020 --> 14:50.923
- Right.
- So you're--so Catelynn--

14:50.990 --> 14:52.124
- She's not an out
of control addict,

14:52.191 --> 14:55.461
she has addictive
elements, right?

14:55.527 --> 14:56.762
That's one of the things
they were working on, right?

14:56.829 --> 14:58.664
- Right.
- Getting you cleaned up.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.933
- I guess I don't see her
as an addict

15:01.000 --> 15:02.268
so I don't know, like,
so when I think...

15:02.334 --> 15:03.602
- Well, she's not is she? She--

15:03.669 --> 15:04.837
- About, like, toasting for,
like, wine--

15:04.903 --> 15:06.205
- You're right,
and I think about addiction

15:06.272 --> 15:08.173
as, you know,
insipient, mild,

15:08.240 --> 15:09.975
moderate, severe, advanced,
you know, I it as a spectrum.

15:10.042 --> 15:11.644
- Oh, okay I got it, right.
- Right?

15:11.710 --> 15:12.978
And I'm saying oh, she had
some mental health issues,

15:13.045 --> 15:14.513
addiction,
substances got involved in--

15:14.580 --> 15:15.948
- Because people--I think
there's a lot of addicts

15:16.015 --> 15:17.349
out there that don't even
realize they're addicts,

15:17.416 --> 15:18.384
like, you got to have
coffee every morning?

15:18.450 --> 15:20.152
Well then you're
addicted to caffeine.

15:20.219 --> 15:21.787
Got to smoke that cigarette,
you're addicted to nicotine.

15:21.854 --> 15:23.455
{\an3}- And there are addicts that
never get out of control, too.

15:23.522 --> 15:25.391
And she's sort of
that zone, for sure.

15:25.457 --> 15:27.493
April, after all what
they've been through,

15:27.559 --> 15:28.360
are you surprised
with how they're doing?

15:28.427 --> 15:30.529
They've been through so much.

15:30.596 --> 15:33.132
- No, I'm not surprised.

15:33.198 --> 15:34.400
They've been through
so much already.

15:34.466 --> 15:36.568
I mean, this is just
a little bit.

15:36.635 --> 15:37.803
- Were you proud of her
for going down for treatment?

15:37.870 --> 15:39.071
{\an1}- Oh, yeah
I was very proud of her

15:39.138 --> 15:41.373
for taking that step on her own

15:41.440 --> 15:43.509
{\an1}and knowing
that she needed the help.

15:43.575 --> 15:46.578

- Awesome, she's great.

15:46.645 --> 15:48.681
Where is she? I kind of want you
to see her, Dr. Drew.

{\an3}such good role model and talking
about this, reducing stigma.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.089
{\an3}April, thanks for supporting
her through this...

17:33.652 --> 17:35.287
it's a checkup with me,
Dr. Drew.

17:35.354 --> 17:38.490
I'm here now with Amber.
- Hi.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.092
- Now, compared to the past,
this season

17:40.159 --> 17:42.694
was relatively stable,
but not all smooth sailing.

17:42.761 --> 17:44.430
Of course Amber,
struggling to stay clean,

17:44.496 --> 17:47.099

about Matt's past

17:47.166 --> 17:49.001
and the custody status
of her daughter Leah.

17:49.067 --> 17:50.769

{\an1}- The thing that makes me happy
when I'm really depressed is

17:57.443 --> 17:59.111
when I have people
that care about me,

17:59.178 --> 18:00.612
and love me that are around me.
- And you don't know--

If I did I think
I'd feel better.

18:03.549 --> 18:04.716
- How's custody going with you?

18:04.783 --> 18:07.553
{\an3}- Good, but primarily
since Gary lives

18:07.619 --> 18:09.388
closer to her school she'll
be there during school days.

18:13.125 --> 18:16.028

{\an7}I think Booboo
is gonna be so excited.

18:18.363 --> 18:20.966
{\an7}Being closer it's like
this is a family.

{\an8}What do you think, Booger?

18:23.869 --> 18:25.504
{\an7}I really want things
to cool down with Matt

18:25.571 --> 18:27.873
{\an8}and what people's
perception of him.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.409
{\an8}- It was child support,
and I don't know if the rumors

18:30.476 --> 18:32.411
{\an9}are true about Matt
having more kids.

18:32.478 --> 18:34.379

{\an8}that we're not
even gonna respond to it.

{\an8}- What man do you want
to marry now?

18:48.126 --> 18:50.896
{\an9}I went through being called
the fat girl on the show

18:50.963 --> 18:52.498
{\an8}and it's not easy,

18:52.564 --> 18:55.100
{\an8}but now I'm ready to lose
the weight and be healthy.

right now.

18:57.336 --> 19:00.172
{\an8}- That looks disgusting.

19:00.239 --> 19:02.341
{\an8}- I'm so self-conscious
about my chin.

19:02.407 --> 19:03.909
{\an8}They're giving me my curves back

19:03.976 --> 19:05.577
{\an8}and everything's gonna be
a little bit tighter.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.446
{\an8}- The bruising's getting better.

19:07.513 --> 19:09.114
{\an8}That was my son, Christopher.

19:09.181 --> 19:11.550
{\an7}He is 25.

19:11.617 --> 19:13.385

I just feel like
everybody hates me again.

19:27.599 --> 19:30.435
I just want us to be left alone.

do you still feel like you did

19:39.845 --> 19:41.747
at that last scene there
where you felt like

19:41.813 --> 19:43.315
{\an3}everyone--
who is everyone by the way?

19:43.382 --> 19:44.950
Like, social media again?

19:45.017 --> 19:48.420
- I just feel like that
I've worked so hard for people

19:48.487 --> 19:51.089
to see how I really am compared
to who I was on drugs

19:51.156 --> 19:52.824
that I don't want people
to see me go back

19:52.891 --> 19:54.259
and do that behavior,

19:54.326 --> 19:55.994
or look at me
at that kind of person.

19:56.061 --> 19:57.596
- Now you went
through some surgeries.

19:57.663 --> 20:00.432
{\an1}- I did,
but I had lost 40 pounds

20:00.499 --> 20:03.735
{\an1}and I got on new
anti-psychotic medication

20:03.802 --> 20:06.438
and I had gained about 30 back.

20:06.505 --> 20:09.141
I went back on my diet the way
that I did before to lose weight

20:09.207 --> 20:12.277
and I could not lose weight
so I got really desperate

20:12.344 --> 20:14.279
and I got some surgery.

20:14.346 --> 20:18.016
- You happy?
- I am happy. I kept my curves.

20:18.083 --> 20:20.519
I didn't do anything
drastic or anything.

20:20.586 --> 20:22.321
I didn't get crazy boobs.

20:22.387 --> 20:23.789
- I'm looking at your pupils

20:23.855 --> 20:25.290
{\an3}and they are most
definitely not pinned

20:25.357 --> 20:27.192
{\an3}which is surprising to me
three weeks

20:27.259 --> 20:29.027
{\an3}out from surgery for somebody
with your history.

20:29.094 --> 20:31.096
- Yes.
- So tell me how that all went.

20:31.163 --> 20:33.532
{\an1}- I was on pain medication
for a few days.

20:33.599 --> 20:35.968
{\an3}- Well, can I interrupt you
as you tell the story?

20:36.034 --> 20:38.770
{\an3}Which is not only
appropriate, necessary.

20:38.837 --> 20:40.806
{\an3}Because you're in recovery
doesn't mean you have to suffer.

20:40.872 --> 20:41.540
- Very, very necessary.
- You have surgery,

20:41.607 --> 20:43.008
you have an injury,

20:43.075 --> 20:44.543
you get opiates
for a couple of days.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.278
Now the...
- Yes.

20:46.345 --> 20:46.845
{\an3}- What comes after that is what
gets a little dicey, so...

20:46.912 --> 20:48.614
- Yes...
- Go ahead.

20:48.680 --> 20:51.683
- So I surprised myself though
when I got off the medication.

20:51.750 --> 20:56.188
I didn't want it,
I wasn't feigning for it,

20:56.254 --> 20:59.358
and now I'm just on Tylenol
and Ibuprofens.

20:59.424 --> 21:01.293
I'm not on any pain medication,
any narcotics.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.961
{\an3}- Good, count your blessings,
you know?

21:03.028 --> 21:04.162
- But I need people
to understand

21:04.229 --> 21:06.298
that I was in such
a depressed state

21:06.365 --> 21:08.467
that I had to do this for myself

21:08.533 --> 21:12.404
or I would've been...

21:12.471 --> 21:14.840
useless.
- Are you in the program now?

21:14.906 --> 21:16.408
{\an1}- No, I don't do the program
and you know

21:16.475 --> 21:18.677
I don't do the program....
- I didn't know you--

21:18.744 --> 21:19.978
I know you haven't done it...

21:20.045 --> 21:21.313
- You know I don't
do the program.

21:21.380 --> 21:23.415
{\an3}- I'll always ask you
"Are you in the program?"

21:23.482 --> 21:25.851
Don't be defensive, just--
- I'm not being defensive.

21:25.917 --> 21:27.252
- A little bit, a little bit,
it's all right.

21:27.319 --> 21:29.021
Talk to me about
borderline personality.

21:29.087 --> 21:31.056
What have you learned about that
and what kinds of treatment?

21:31.123 --> 21:33.825
- It's new, I just got diagnosed
with it not too long ago

21:33.892 --> 21:36.328
and it was
very surprising to me.

21:36.395 --> 21:38.397
I don't want to accept it

21:38.463 --> 21:42.834
'cause I don't need any more
mental illness crap on me.

21:42.901 --> 21:46.538
I'd like to think I'm normal.

21:46.605 --> 21:50.776
But however when I don't have my
medication I'm not normal,

21:50.842 --> 21:52.778
and--Ugh.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.814
{\an3}- What?

21:57.683 --> 22:00.218
- Which is hard to accept.

22:00.285 --> 22:02.621
I just want to be normal.

22:02.688 --> 22:04.356
{\an3}- You know,
borderline personality

22:04.423 --> 22:06.458
is marked by a lot of chaos
in relationships,

22:06.525 --> 22:08.193
{\an3}so it's good that you've been
able to maintain

22:08.260 --> 22:10.095
{\an3}this nice, stable relationship
with Matt.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.431
{\an3}It's associated with a lot
of unregulated emotion,

22:12.497 --> 22:14.633
{\an3}which bipolar is, too,
so they kind of overlap there.

22:14.700 --> 22:16.068
{\an1}- Yeah.

22:16.134 --> 22:17.469
- And a lot of
unregulated anger.

22:17.536 --> 22:19.137
{\an1}- Yeah.

22:19.204 --> 22:19.938
- And you're familiar
with that, right?

22:20.005 --> 22:21.940
- I like nice people.
- Yeah.

22:22.007 --> 22:26.078
- But I don't like mean people
'cause then I get mean.

22:26.144 --> 22:27.746
[laughter]

22:27.813 --> 22:29.815
Only if they're mean
to me first, though.

22:29.881 --> 22:31.316
- But--
- See, I want people

22:31.383 --> 22:34.086
to understand that I cannot
just be mean to you.

22:34.152 --> 22:36.288
- I get it.
- Like, I'm not Farrah Abraham.

22:36.354 --> 22:40.058
Like, I can't just be mean
to you for no reason.

22:40.125 --> 22:42.794
{\an1}But if you're mean to me,
I'm a woman,

22:42.861 --> 22:44.563
I'm gonna stand up for myself.

22:44.629 --> 22:46.798
{\an3}- Speaking of Farrah, you had
that conversation with her.

22:46.865 --> 22:49.935
{\an3}Do you have any feelings
about that whole--

22:50.001 --> 22:51.603
are you and Farrah okay
I guess is the question.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.505
- Hell, no.
- How come?

22:53.572 --> 22:55.340
- We used to be,
then one day she decided

22:55.407 --> 22:58.510
to open up her crooked lips.

22:58.577 --> 23:00.011
- I don't know exactly
what you're talking about.

23:00.078 --> 23:02.914
- She decided to do an interview

23:02.981 --> 23:06.251
saying something around
that something

23:06.318 --> 23:08.754
about how it's good
that Leah's with Gary

23:08.820 --> 23:11.656
and how my house
probably smells like piss

23:11.723 --> 23:13.792
because of my dogs
that I rescue,

23:13.859 --> 23:16.862
by the way they're all rescues
because I love animals.

23:16.928 --> 23:18.163
- Well this--
- You don't do that.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.097
{\an3}- This is back to your
somebody's

23:19.164 --> 23:20.499
being mean so I'm gonna be?

23:20.565 --> 23:24.136
- And she's been mean
to Catelynn, Maci,

23:24.202 --> 23:28.106
my fiancé, Taylor,
everybody on this show,

23:28.173 --> 23:30.776
and her piece of [bleep]
boy toy Simon.

23:30.842 --> 23:32.644
{\an1}When she makes a quote saying
she's the reason

23:32.711 --> 23:34.479
why this show's on,

23:34.546 --> 23:36.848
well I'm sorry but when I went
to prison this show was not on,

23:36.915 --> 23:39.050
and when I got out it sure
as hell came on.

23:39.117 --> 23:41.787
And she was selling her
vagina while I was gone.

23:41.853 --> 23:46.358
So we'll make that clear.

23:46.424 --> 23:48.960
- Can you stay
a little more positive about--

23:49.027 --> 23:51.363
- No, I'm good.
- Okay. [laughs]

23:51.429 --> 23:55.233
{\an1}- No, Dr. Drew, no,
do not let her get away

23:55.300 --> 23:56.735
{\an1}with what she does,
and you do.

23:56.802 --> 23:58.069
You need to call her out more

23:58.136 --> 24:00.071
when she's sitting
on this stage.

24:00.138 --> 24:01.807
And you let her get away
with a lot of things.

24:01.873 --> 24:04.409
The way she speaks to the crew,

24:04.476 --> 24:07.245
the way she speaks to people
in general, her mother,

24:07.312 --> 24:10.348
her father is disrespectful
and disgusting.

24:10.415 --> 24:12.684
{\an1}And I'm just saying
what a lot of people think,

24:12.751 --> 24:14.653
she needs to change.

24:14.719 --> 24:15.921
{\an3}- My understanding is we're
gonna try to get you guys

24:15.987 --> 24:19.925
all out here together.
- Better be on a far end.

24:19.991 --> 24:23.261
She better not say
a word to me...

24:23.328 --> 24:25.230
except for "I'm sorry."

24:25.297 --> 24:28.233
If she's woman
enough to do that.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.935
- Will you accept an apology?
- Absolutely.

24:30.001 --> 24:31.570
- Okay.
- Absolutely.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.238
{\an3}- Okay, here's what
I want to know,

24:33.305 --> 24:34.172
{\an3}how's your relationship
with Matt?

24:34.239 --> 24:36.274
- Great.
- Okay, that's--look--

24:36.341 --> 24:37.776
- Great.
- Yeah, it's good, it's loving,

24:37.843 --> 24:41.246
you feel secure, you feel happy?
- Yes. This man truly loves me.

24:41.313 --> 24:44.216
Everything he does for me.
He's a good guy.

24:44.282 --> 24:47.586
Yes, he has a horrible past,
but, guys, come on.

24:47.652 --> 24:51.122
{\an1}Yes, he has five kids.
Yes, he does.

24:51.189 --> 24:52.924
{\an1}But he was also young
and ignorant,

24:52.991 --> 24:56.394
and he wasn't--he was--
he was a ho.

24:56.461 --> 24:57.596
[laughter]

24:57.662 --> 24:59.197
- Okay, well,
speaking of Matt

24:59.264 --> 25:01.433
I'm gonna bring him out here
right after this break.

25:23.822 --> 25:26.424
So, Matt, your take
on this season?

25:26.491 --> 25:28.126
- It's not as dramatic
as the last one's been,

25:28.193 --> 25:29.794
that's for sure.
- Right.

25:29.861 --> 25:33.164
- I think it's been okay so far.
- You know, Amber had

25:33.231 --> 25:37.135
all this surgery recently,
were you cool with that?

25:37.202 --> 25:38.670
- I was against it.
- You were against it? How come?

25:38.737 --> 25:40.972
{\an1}- I was very much--I didn't
think she needed to do anything.

25:41.039 --> 25:43.174
{\an1}I thought she was perfect.
I was worried about her safety.

25:43.241 --> 25:45.043
{\an1}That was the most
important thing to me.

25:45.110 --> 25:46.878
{\an1}Anytime you have surgery
it's a risk.

25:46.945 --> 25:49.547
- That's true.
- And that's where I was looking

25:49.614 --> 25:51.149
{\an1}at it from,
but when she told me

25:51.216 --> 25:53.485
{\an1}why she was doing it, it wasn't
a vanity issue for her,

25:53.551 --> 25:56.021
{\an1}it was she wanted
to feel better about herself

25:56.087 --> 25:57.289
and if this was gonna help her

25:57.355 --> 25:59.224
then I had no choice
but to get behind it.

25:59.291 --> 26:02.794
- Now, you guys get
all these crazy rumors

26:02.861 --> 26:04.329
online and the social media.
- Yeah.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.398
{\an3}- Why do you think
you're such targets?

26:06.464 --> 26:07.899
- He's 20 years older than me.

26:07.966 --> 26:09.567
- 'Cause I'm 20 years
older than she is.

26:09.634 --> 26:11.836
- Anybody watching the show
can see that this man loves me,

26:11.903 --> 26:13.538
and he takes care of me.

26:13.605 --> 26:15.640
What I'm at the darkest
of my days he's the one

26:15.707 --> 26:17.742
{\an3}getting me out of bed
and putting me in the bath

26:17.809 --> 26:19.077
{\an3}when I didn't even want
to get out of bed.

26:19.144 --> 26:20.745
{\an3}We went through
a really rough patch

26:20.812 --> 26:22.881
when all this stuff came out

26:22.948 --> 26:24.149
'cause I didn't know
what to believe,

26:24.215 --> 26:25.517
{\an3}but I found the truth
out eventually

26:25.583 --> 26:28.053
and he was
a little ho back in the day.

26:28.119 --> 26:30.188
- Is there truth you want
to straighten out here?

26:30.255 --> 26:31.990
{\an3}I mean,
are there details maybe--

26:32.057 --> 26:34.926
{\an1}- We don't really respond to
a lot of it because it--

26:34.993 --> 26:36.895
{\an1}we don't want to give attention
to stupid stuff but--

26:36.962 --> 26:38.663
{\an3}- Well, and see when Amber says
"I know the truth"

26:38.730 --> 26:41.232
is there stuff
you need to set straight?

26:41.299 --> 26:42.934
- Not--
- He doesn't owe child support

26:43.001 --> 26:44.436
{\an3}for one,
you can look it up online.

26:44.502 --> 26:45.770
- No.
- He does not owe child support.

26:45.837 --> 26:47.539
- Nothing.

26:47.605 --> 26:48.173
- And then Christopher
got back into your lives.

26:48.239 --> 26:49.908
- Yeah.
- How is that?

26:49.975 --> 26:52.010
- He's doing great.
- He's doing amazing.

26:52.077 --> 26:53.945
- He is sober.

26:54.012 --> 26:55.380
- I'm a little unclear
why he left.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.183
{\an3}- Because he met this girl
and they really--

26:58.249 --> 26:59.584
- So you didn't kick him out?

26:59.651 --> 27:01.753
both: No.
- And a lot of the other

27:01.820 --> 27:03.955
sort of consternation

27:04.022 --> 27:05.623
about you reaching out
to Farrah, or Jenelle?

27:05.690 --> 27:07.425
- That is such a fallacy.

27:07.492 --> 27:09.260
{\an3}- Well, take people through
the timeline.

27:09.327 --> 27:10.729
Or what did happen.

27:10.795 --> 27:11.763
- I want to make
a point real quick,

27:11.830 --> 27:13.898
I did not give a [bleep]

27:13.965 --> 27:15.567
what he did before we met,

27:15.633 --> 27:17.268
{\an3}nor do I care
if he tried to get

27:17.335 --> 27:19.771
{\an3}with every woman
on every reality TV show.

27:19.838 --> 27:21.973
{\an3}I love this man right here,
and he loves me,

27:22.040 --> 27:24.075
and nobody can doubt that.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.910
{\an3}- I think what people do is
they think

27:25.977 --> 27:28.046
that you are somehow preoccupied
with this show or--

27:28.113 --> 27:29.481
- No.
- I understand,

27:29.547 --> 27:31.649
but that's what I think
the energy comes from.

27:31.716 --> 27:33.084
{\an1}- That's all right, let them
think that, it's not true.

27:33.151 --> 27:34.719
{\an3}- I think he watched this show
all the time,

27:34.786 --> 27:36.488
{\an3}I just don't think
he wants to admit it.

27:36.554 --> 27:38.757
- I watched the other one.
- I think he's just like every

27:38.823 --> 27:40.625
other guy who's older like

27:40.692 --> 27:42.727
"I don't watch "Teen Mom."
I don't do that."

27:42.794 --> 27:44.596
Yes, you do.
The hell you don't.

27:44.662 --> 27:48.967
{\an3}- Okay, you've got to admit
it's a good show.

27:49.034 --> 27:50.935
- So, did you watch what Amber

27:51.002 --> 27:52.270
{\an3}and I talked about
back out here?

27:52.337 --> 27:53.805
- Oh, yeah.
- Where she had all

27:53.872 --> 27:55.140
{\an3}the strong feelings
about Farrah?

27:55.206 --> 27:56.908
- Yeah.
- Where are you with that?

27:56.975 --> 27:58.510
{\an1}- I have no feelings
towards Farrah.

27:58.576 --> 28:03.481
{\an1}She--we had her back
from the day I met her.

28:03.548 --> 28:06.151
{\an1}She would ask us, you know,
"Do you got a problem

28:06.217 --> 28:08.787
{\an1}with what I did porn-wise,
blah, blah, blah?"

28:08.853 --> 28:11.322
We always said no, whatever you
have to do, so on and so forth.

28:11.389 --> 28:12.657
And then for her to turn around

28:12.724 --> 28:14.426
{\an1}and stab us
in the back like that.

28:14.492 --> 28:18.496
{\an1}I mean, she is so disrespectful
to Amber, Maci, and Catelynn

28:18.563 --> 28:20.131
who are just as responsible

28:20.198 --> 28:21.666
{\an1}for getting the message
of this show out,

28:21.733 --> 28:23.601
and the success of this show,

28:23.668 --> 28:27.772
{\an1}and for her to elevate herself
to this status is unfair.

28:27.839 --> 28:30.442
- What was it that she said
that bothered you so much?

28:30.508 --> 28:33.611
- Well, she said something about
Leah being better off with Gary.

28:33.678 --> 28:36.681
- And Farrah said this,
not Simon or somebody else?

28:36.748 --> 28:38.016
- Oh, Simon had a lot to say,

28:38.083 --> 28:40.452
but he doesn't
even want to come near.

28:40.518 --> 28:43.855
Simon called him a pedophile.

28:43.922 --> 28:46.224
Who the--who are you?

28:46.291 --> 28:47.325
{\an1}- He called--
and that's nothing,

28:47.392 --> 28:48.626
he attacked everybody
on this show.

28:48.693 --> 28:50.161
- He attacked everybody
worse than us.

28:50.228 --> 28:51.563
He attacked everybody
on this show

28:51.629 --> 28:53.465
when he was doing his SnapChats
saying worse things

28:53.531 --> 28:55.300
about everybody else
on the show,

28:55.366 --> 28:58.203
and I'm not Mama Bear,
but these are my friends,

28:58.269 --> 28:59.637
this is my family.

28:59.704 --> 29:01.739
We've went through
a lot of stuff together.

29:01.806 --> 29:03.541
{\an1}- And we're gonna be around
when this show is over

29:03.608 --> 29:06.211
and something tells me he's not.
- What do you mean?

29:06.277 --> 29:07.312
{\an1}- I would've handled
the situation

29:07.378 --> 29:08.646
differently
if this was five years ago.

29:08.713 --> 29:10.415
- Not in a good way?
- Not in a good way, no.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.484
{\an1}you don't--I mean, you want to
make fun of me yeah, guess what?

29:12.550 --> 29:14.652
{\an1}I'm 20 years older than Amber,
haha, that's funny.

29:14.719 --> 29:16.488
- Honey, I think you look good.
- You know, I mean...

29:16.554 --> 29:18.189
- I think he looks good.
- You can say "Oh,

29:18.256 --> 29:20.892
{\an1}Matt has kids."
You can make fun of that.

29:20.959 --> 29:22.227
- You're a little ho.
- "He's a pedophile."

29:22.293 --> 29:24.662
{\an1}Who in the [bleep]
does this kid think he is?

29:24.729 --> 29:26.531
- Hey.
- Sorry.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.233
- I got to take a break.

29:28.299 --> 29:31.102
{\an3}When we return I'll welcome Gary
so we can get an update

29:31.169 --> 29:33.104

So, you guys seem in a

- And now you're moving closer

29:55.894 --> 29:57.595

29:57.662 --> 30:00.365

away from her school now.

30:00.431 --> 30:02.267
{\an3}- So is that gonna
open things up

30:02.333 --> 30:03.501

get her week nights?

30:03.568 --> 30:04.836

to let me do a little bit more.

30:10.241 --> 30:11.943
I'm trying.
- What do you think?

30:12.010 --> 30:14.379
Is it a possibility that she'll
spend some time with Amber?

30:14.445 --> 30:16.814
- There's always a possibility
and, you know, she--like I said,

30:16.881 --> 30:20.118
she's making the right
moves there for a while

30:20.185 --> 30:24.122
and I don't know so much about
it with her depression so--

30:24.189 --> 30:26.524
- Which I communicated
with him and Kristina

30:26.591 --> 30:27.825
{\an3}about the depression
when all that happened.

30:27.892 --> 30:30.161
{\an1}- So with that going on
she hasn't seen her as much.

30:30.228 --> 30:32.463
So, you know, basically I told
her it's like, you know,

30:32.530 --> 30:35.200
"when you start using the time
that you get then eventually,

30:35.266 --> 30:37.669
you know, that's when we can see
if there's something else."

30:37.735 --> 30:39.571
- You seem much calmer
about them,

30:39.637 --> 30:41.206
their relationship,
their household.

30:41.272 --> 30:42.907
You more secure about that?

30:42.974 --> 30:46.177
- You know, yeah.

30:46.244 --> 30:48.046
{\an1}Like, you know, I was really--
I was kind of rude to Matt

30:48.112 --> 30:50.181
last time which we have--
afterwards we all

30:50.248 --> 30:51.983
had dinner together
and I apologized to him

30:52.050 --> 30:53.418
which I really meant.
I didn't, you know--

30:53.484 --> 30:54.852
I said something
I really regret.

30:54.919 --> 30:56.821
I just wanted her to be careful

30:56.888 --> 30:59.257
'cause there was a third person
involved, you know?

30:59.324 --> 31:01.593
And that is, you know,

31:01.659 --> 31:02.894
and it's just making sure that
Leah's okay, and Leah's safe.

31:02.961 --> 31:04.495
- Yeah, I mean, your heart was
in the right place.

31:04.562 --> 31:05.830
{\an1}- Yeah.
And I don't think

31:05.897 --> 31:07.565
{\an1}Matt would ever,
ever do anything to hurt my kid.

31:07.632 --> 31:08.533
{\an3}- Well, that's what I'm saying.
Now you seem like you...

31:08.600 --> 31:10.335
{\an1}- Yeah.

31:10.401 --> 31:13.571
- Feel like he's in a totally
different place, am I right?

31:13.638 --> 31:15.707
- Like, Gary?
- Yeah, like, before he felt--

31:15.773 --> 31:17.775
- With Matt, yeah.
- No, with your whole--

31:17.842 --> 31:19.677
your household,
he seems fine with it now.

31:19.744 --> 31:22.547
- Yeah, but I still want
more time with Leah,

31:22.614 --> 31:23.781
and I want to bring her
to school.

31:23.848 --> 31:25.683
I want to pick her up
from school.

31:25.750 --> 31:28.686
And Kristina
is an amazing person,

31:28.753 --> 31:31.889
but I am the mother.
I need my time with her.

31:31.956 --> 31:34.559
{\an1}- Well, look the reason why
it's set the way it is,

31:34.626 --> 31:37.528
{\an1}is 'cause with--it's
just a routine that she's on.

31:37.595 --> 31:39.731
{\an1}She wakes up in the morning,
we get up early--

31:39.797 --> 31:42.267
- I'm not incapable.
- I'm not saying you are.

31:42.333 --> 31:44.102
- Yes, you are.
- I did not say that.

31:44.168 --> 31:45.870
- You don't have to say it.
- When you're not utilizing

31:45.937 --> 31:48.039
what you have it makes it hard
for me to say okay,

31:48.106 --> 31:50.375
{\an1}let's go ahead and let her
go over on a weekday

31:50.441 --> 31:51.376
{\an1}when she has school
the next day.

31:51.442 --> 31:52.610
- I already explained that.

31:52.677 --> 31:53.611
I don't need to explain
that again.

31:53.678 --> 31:55.213
{\an1}- And--no, you don't have
to explain it.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.615
It just always seems like
there's something else

31:57.682 --> 32:01.419
{\an1}and whether it be the depression
or something it's like,

32:01.486 --> 32:03.087
{\an1}you know, you're not getting--
you haven't--

32:03.154 --> 32:03.921
- I don't understand.
- You get her every Wednesday,

32:03.988 --> 32:05.223
{\an1}right?
After school?

32:05.290 --> 32:06.491
You get one day.
You haven't seen her.

32:06.557 --> 32:07.558
You haven't gotten her
a Wednesday

32:07.625 --> 32:09.160
after school at all this year.

32:09.227 --> 32:11.062
- But when I talked to you
about what happened

32:11.129 --> 32:12.897
with my depression,

32:12.964 --> 32:14.432
that's been going on
for a while.

32:14.499 --> 32:15.733
{\an1}- Okay, do you see what
I'm saying though?

32:15.800 --> 32:17.335
- I don't need to explain this

32:17.402 --> 32:19.504
because it's already been
talked about with you.

32:19.570 --> 32:20.938
- Yeah.
- You know, a lot of

32:21.005 --> 32:24.342
the depression came from
not having my daughter.

32:24.409 --> 32:25.910
{\an1}- She gets every other weekend
and every Wednesday,

32:25.977 --> 32:28.579
plus anytime she communicates
with me about.

32:28.646 --> 32:31.816
{\an3}- Okay, so I'm hearing you say
is the door is open,

32:31.883 --> 32:34.085
{\an3}that she has to request,
you'll comply.

32:34.152 --> 32:36.521
- I just feel like giving up.
I give up.

32:36.587 --> 32:38.856
I give up.
- I didn't hear anything

32:38.923 --> 32:40.825
that egregious,
I must tell you.

32:40.892 --> 32:42.927
- I just give up.
- There's no point to give up.

32:42.994 --> 32:44.629
- I give up.

32:44.696 --> 32:45.830
- I'm not saying
you can't see her.

32:45.897 --> 32:48.866
{\an1}I'm not keeping her from you,
I never will.

32:48.933 --> 32:52.103
You know, the only concern
I have and it's the one is,

32:52.170 --> 32:54.772
{\an1}you know, I want her
to go to school on time.

32:54.839 --> 32:57.141
{\an1}I'm not saying you're not gonna
take her to school on time.

32:57.208 --> 32:59.277
{\an1}It's keeping that same routine
where she comes home,

32:59.344 --> 33:01.279
{\an1}she knows what house
she's going to.

33:01.346 --> 33:02.980
She knows that she has to sit
down and do her school work.

33:03.047 --> 33:04.482
{\an3}- There's nothing
unreasonable about that.

33:04.549 --> 33:06.150
{\an1}- It's nothing to do
with you being a bad mother...

33:06.217 --> 33:07.518
- Just--

33:07.585 --> 33:09.554
{\an1}- I think you've done
a great job.

33:09.620 --> 33:12.123
- I [bleep] give up.
- I mean,

33:12.190 --> 33:13.658
it's--I only have one chance

33:13.725 --> 33:16.127
to do this right
with Leah and you both.

33:16.194 --> 33:18.529
- And so [bleep] what?

33:18.596 --> 33:19.697
And if
you don't remember the day

33:19.764 --> 33:21.299
that you sat in that courtroom

33:21.366 --> 33:22.867
and I put myself in prison

33:22.934 --> 33:24.669
because I was eating
fentanyl patches,

33:24.736 --> 33:26.904
and I opted out for her,
to be there for her!

33:26.971 --> 33:30.174
{\an1}- Okay, well I didn't know
about fentanyl patches.

33:30.241 --> 33:31.743
- To be there for her!

33:31.809 --> 33:33.544
{\an3}'Cause I wasn't there for her
and you knew it.

33:33.611 --> 33:36.481
- Okay. I'm not--
- And we talked about it!

33:36.547 --> 33:40.151
{\an3}Everything that I sacrificed
just to be there for her!

33:40.218 --> 33:41.652
- And you are there for her!
- Amber, Amber?

33:41.719 --> 33:43.388
- None of what's going on
between

33:43.454 --> 33:45.857
the custody is anything saying
you're incapable.

33:45.923 --> 33:48.559
The way it's set up is by
the--first of all

33:48.626 --> 33:49.994
that's what they recommend

33:50.061 --> 33:51.329
for the structure
of the child, that's it.

33:51.396 --> 33:52.430
Do you remember me asking you

33:52.497 --> 33:53.998
{\an1}to pick up
Leah from school two times?

33:54.065 --> 33:55.333
And you were willing to do it

33:55.400 --> 33:56.868
{\an1}because I needed some time
to--I was--

33:56.934 --> 33:58.603
- Yes, and I did it.
- Okay, so one of the reasons

33:58.669 --> 33:59.904
why I asked you was

33:59.971 --> 34:01.672
{\an1}'cause you wanted
more time with her.

34:01.739 --> 34:04.075
So that was me offering
you more time with her.

34:04.142 --> 34:06.744
- But how many times I ask you
to pick her up and you said no.

34:06.811 --> 34:10.114
{\an1}- No, you can pick her up,
I have no problem with that.

34:10.181 --> 34:11.949
{\an1}And I was--
I promise you that.

34:12.016 --> 34:14.252
{\an1}It's not that,
it's the overnights

34:14.318 --> 34:15.786
{\an1}for the structure,
that is it.

34:15.853 --> 34:17.588
{\an1}You want to pick her up,
you can bring her home

34:17.655 --> 34:19.290
{\an1}and you can do
some schoolwork with her,

34:19.357 --> 34:20.792
{\an1}I don't care about that.
We are--

34:20.858 --> 34:24.629
- I [bleep] asked to do that.
- And you can.

34:24.695 --> 34:27.398
- I'm done talking about this
before I walk off this stage.

34:27.465 --> 34:30.568
{\an3}- All right, we--
I heard you say

34:30.635 --> 34:31.902
she can come anytime
and pick her up.

34:31.969 --> 34:33.603
- Yes.
- I heard you say the afternoons

34:33.670 --> 34:35.907
are hers if she requests.

34:35.973 --> 34:37.608
- Yeah.
- No! No!

34:37.675 --> 34:39.744
- That's not the case?
- I said it and I stand by it,

34:39.811 --> 34:41.212
and I will say it again.

34:41.279 --> 34:42.647
- Not doing this.
- All right.

34:42.713 --> 34:45.315
{\an1}- But if she's getting
this emotional and upset,

34:45.382 --> 34:46.951
this is my thing is--

34:47.018 --> 34:48.820
{\an3}- There's something
triggering her.

34:48.886 --> 34:49.887
- Right, that's what I'm saying.
- Something triggering so--

34:49.954 --> 34:51.722
- I'm seriously trying
to keep it cool.

34:51.789 --> 34:53.558
I'm not trying to--I'm not
calling anybody out or anything.

34:53.623 --> 34:54.625
I'm not trying to poke the bear.

34:54.692 --> 34:56.393
{\an1}I'm not trying
to start anything.

34:56.460 --> 34:58.062
{\an1}I'm just trying to keep
a cool head.

34:58.129 --> 34:59.397
{\an3}- I understand, what she heard
was "you don't trust me.

34:59.464 --> 35:00.498
I'm not a good mom."
That's what she heard.

35:00.565 --> 35:02.633
{\an1}- I understand that.
I understand that.

35:02.700 --> 35:05.336
- I'm so [bleep] done
with this [bleep].

35:05.403 --> 35:08.506
I'm done with this show.
I'm done.

35:08.573 --> 35:12.243
I [bleep] quit.
I quit.

35:12.310 --> 35:15.346
- Because?
- I'm done.

35:15.413 --> 35:18.082
- Because what happened?
- I'm just done.

35:18.149 --> 35:19.617
I've been doing this
for eight years, I'm 26.

35:19.684 --> 35:23.120
I'm done.
I'm done.

35:23.187 --> 35:24.655
I quit.

35:31.829 --> 35:34.732
[sniffling]

35:38.002 --> 35:40.371
{\an3}- Come with me.
Come here.

35:43.508 --> 35:45.510
- I want to go.

35:45.576 --> 35:47.979
{\an3}- So your thing
is these emotional outbursts

35:48.045 --> 35:49.881
{\an3}are exactly
what you're afraid of?

35:49.947 --> 35:51.315
- Yeah, I mean--
- I mean, it's precisely

35:51.382 --> 35:53.284
{\an3}the instability
you're concerned about.

35:53.351 --> 35:56.387
- See,
I want to say something.

35:56.454 --> 35:59.323
When she's late,
because she is late,

35:59.390 --> 36:01.559
or there's times
where she's a no show, like,

36:01.626 --> 36:03.461
when we were going
through the custody battles,

36:03.528 --> 36:05.329
or the custody thing
I kept it away

36:05.396 --> 36:07.164
from Leah as much as I could.

36:07.231 --> 36:10.334
And I would write down every
single time that she was late,

36:10.401 --> 36:13.304
and she wouldn't come, you know,
and there was quite a bit.

36:13.371 --> 36:16.374
{\an1}And I don't want to be, like,
well here, I'm gonna--

36:16.440 --> 36:17.808
I don't want to say reward,

36:17.875 --> 36:20.811
but I don't want to give up
more of my time

36:20.878 --> 36:22.380
when you're not utilizing
what you already have.

36:22.446 --> 36:25.349
- Gary, they are asking me
to go back and talk to Amber.

36:25.416 --> 36:27.818
So give me a second, okay?
- Okay, I'll just hang out here.

36:27.885 --> 36:29.554
[audience chuckles]
- All right.

36:29.620 --> 36:32.557
<i>[gentle music]</i>

36:36.827 --> 36:38.596
<i>[upbeat rock music]</i>

36:38.663 --> 36:40.798
- Right, now as you saw
Amber got upset.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.800
She does not want to speak
to Gary any longer,

36:42.867 --> 36:45.436
but she's agreed to come
back out to speak with Kristina,

36:45.503 --> 36:47.638
so let's bring the two of them
out here right now.

36:47.705 --> 36:50.641
[applause]

36:55.913 --> 37:00.318
{\an3}Okay, ladies,
you okay?

37:00.384 --> 37:03.454
- I'm okay.
- Damn, that boy triggers you.

37:03.521 --> 37:05.957
- It's not him,
it's the fact of everything.

37:06.023 --> 37:08.859
- Okay.
Kristina, what do you think?

37:08.926 --> 37:11.929
Any thoughts?
You saw what happened.

37:11.996 --> 37:16.100
- No thoughts. No words.
- I have some thoughts,

37:16.167 --> 37:20.004
and it seems to me that Amber
is triggered so much by Gary,

37:20.071 --> 37:23.174
{\an3}it'd be helpful
if you talked to Amber

37:23.240 --> 37:24.508
and if Matt talked to Gary.

37:24.575 --> 37:26.010
I think that's helpful, too.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.678
{\an3}But maybe the two of you
could have, you know,

37:27.745 --> 37:30.181
{\an3}really work this out
mom-to-mom.

37:30.247 --> 37:32.683
{\an3}I mean, the reality
is you must be deeply invested

37:32.750 --> 37:35.119
in Leah's parenting, yeah.
- I am. I am.

37:35.186 --> 37:37.288
{\an3}- And so, you know,
when Gary gets anxious,

37:37.355 --> 37:41.859
whatever maybe you can sort of
as a mom talking to another mom,

37:41.926 --> 37:44.362
{\an3}you know, help smooth
these things over.

37:44.428 --> 37:47.798
{\an3}It seems so simple.
Why is it so complicated?

37:47.865 --> 37:50.034
- I think the complication
lays in Gary.

37:50.101 --> 37:52.003
{\an3}- It just seems like
the immediate thing to do

37:52.069 --> 37:54.005
is start the afternoons
over at their household

37:54.071 --> 37:55.406
{\an3}if you're cool with that.
I mean that's just--

37:55.473 --> 37:57.074
- Yeah, I mean there's
a starting point definitely.

37:57.141 --> 37:58.175
- That's just immediate,
I mean, right? Immediately...

37:58.242 --> 37:59.810
- Definitely.
- We should be doing that.

37:59.877 --> 38:00.745
But I'm sorry I've not
brought this up sooner,

38:00.811 --> 38:02.480
but your daughter was very ill.

38:02.546 --> 38:03.914
- She was.
- Is she okay?

38:03.981 --> 38:06.050
- She is home from
the hospital now recovering.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.519
- I heard scary stuff.
- It was very scary.

38:08.586 --> 38:10.921
- Well, she's how old?
- She just turned nine.

38:10.988 --> 38:12.590
- Oh, but we're okay now?
We're out of the woods?

38:12.657 --> 38:14.992
- She's good. She is good.
- I don't know about you guys,

38:15.059 --> 38:19.030
{\an3}I could never be a pediatrician.
Ill children make me...

38:19.096 --> 38:20.765
{\an3}apoplectic,
and beside myself.

38:20.831 --> 38:22.933
- Very hard.
- Yeah, I felt horrible.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.069
- I feel helpless.
- Yeah, and when I went

38:25.136 --> 38:26.704
and saw her
I just gave her a hug

38:26.771 --> 38:28.739
and told her--
I forget what I said.

38:28.806 --> 38:30.675
{\an3}I whispered something
in here ear and, you know,

38:30.741 --> 38:32.109
I just--'cause she's a mom

38:32.176 --> 38:33.944
and I am so thankful

38:34.011 --> 38:38.449
for Kristina
being in Leah's life because--

38:38.516 --> 38:40.584
{\an3}and I just don't want
to talk bad about Gary,

38:40.651 --> 38:41.886
I really don't, hun.

38:41.952 --> 38:44.689
And I know you do a lot.

38:44.755 --> 38:46.590
I know you do a lot,

38:46.657 --> 38:48.959
and I want to take that
burden off of you a little bit

38:49.026 --> 38:50.761
'cause I am her mom,

38:50.828 --> 38:55.132
and I'm willing
and I want to.

38:55.199 --> 38:57.101
So if--you understand
what I'm saying?

38:57.168 --> 39:00.438
- I do.
- Without being rude.

39:00.504 --> 39:02.239
- And that's where I think Gary,
you know,

39:02.306 --> 39:03.941
can have a starting point

39:04.008 --> 39:08.446
and maybe that would help ease
his mind and go from there.

39:08.512 --> 39:11.482
{\an3}- At least at this point
you guys have a much

39:11.549 --> 39:13.617
healthier communication...
- We do.

39:13.684 --> 39:15.252
- The two of you,
than you and Gary.

39:15.319 --> 39:16.454
- I understand.

39:16.520 --> 39:17.955
- Yeah, we definitely
see eye-to-eye.

39:18.022 --> 39:20.758
I see what she does
for my daughter.

39:20.825 --> 39:23.494
- Well, listen, nobody will
ever replace biological mom.

39:23.561 --> 39:24.962
- No.
- Right.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.297
- And I think
Kristina knows that.

39:26.363 --> 39:28.799
You are never gonna be replaced
in Leah's heart, period.

39:28.866 --> 39:32.436
{\an3}And Kristina knows that 'cause
she has a daughter, right?

39:32.503 --> 39:34.105
I know it feels
like a lot right now

39:34.171 --> 39:35.573
and it's an important
issue for you,

39:35.639 --> 39:38.976
{\an3}but looking at the landscape
over the last few years,

39:39.043 --> 39:44.515
{\an3}this is so manageable,
right?

39:44.582 --> 39:47.084
What you're dealing with here?

39:47.151 --> 39:48.486
- What do you mean?
- It's a scheduling issue

39:48.552 --> 39:51.489
{\an3}as much as anything
and it's a confidence issue,

39:51.555 --> 39:53.824
{\an3}and it's something you guys
will work through.

39:53.891 --> 39:55.459
- I've been trying to work
through this for years.

39:55.526 --> 39:59.130
- Yeah, well have you been
onboard with it?

39:59.196 --> 40:01.632
- I am, and, you know, I try
to leave everything with Gary

40:01.699 --> 40:05.102
and Amber, and I encourage...
- I think that--

40:05.169 --> 40:06.670
- That relationship
as a mother and--

40:06.737 --> 40:08.038
{\an3}- No, I understand, but I think
it's got to be mom-to-mom,

40:08.105 --> 40:10.007
and Matt's got to be the backup.
- Yeah.

40:10.074 --> 40:11.876
{\an3}- And I think
that's the solution.

40:11.942 --> 40:13.944
{\an3}I feel confident
there will be movement.

40:14.011 --> 40:16.013
- Yeah.
- And, you know, let's--

40:16.080 --> 40:17.281
we'll watch.
We'll look and see.

40:17.348 --> 40:18.549
- Looking forward, yeah.
- All right, hopefully Amber

40:18.616 --> 40:20.217
and Gary can work
through these issues

40:20.284 --> 40:22.887
and come to an arrangement
that works for them.

40:22.953 --> 40:24.655
Thank you to Amber, Matt,
Gary and Kristina

40:24.722 --> 40:26.357
for speaking
with us so candidly.

40:26.423 --> 40:28.793
That's it for part
one of the finale special.

40:28.859 --> 40:31.028
In part two
I'll talk to newlywed Maci

40:31.095 --> 40:32.830
about juggling three kids

40:32.897 --> 40:35.666
{\an8}and where things stand
with Bentley's dad Ryan,

40:35.733 --> 40:38.369
{\an8}and I'll talk to Farrah about
her explosive relationships

40:38.435 --> 40:41.372
{\an8}with Simon and her parents
and get her response

40:41.438 --> 40:43.207
{\an8}to what Amber said about her.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.476
{\an8}I'm Dr. Drew,
I'll see you next time.
