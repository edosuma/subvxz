WEBVTT

00:39.996 --> 00:41.867
Rise and shine.

00:41.911 --> 00:44.000
Hey.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.306
Damn, son.

00:45.349 --> 00:46.785
- You trying to get yourself shot?
- No.

00:46.829 --> 00:48.787
Of course not, Daddy.

00:48.831 --> 00:50.267
Morning, Mama. Morning.

00:50.311 --> 00:52.226
Uh, you ever notice
Daddy's a touch melodramatic

00:52.269 --> 00:54.271
before he gets his morning joe?

00:54.315 --> 00:56.012
- Yep.
- I have noticed that.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.361
And I don't know why.

00:57.405 --> 01:00.321
Since his, uh,
alarm is set to...
Mom.

01:00.364 --> 01:02.018
To this song, yes!

01:02.062 --> 01:03.976
It's a f--
it's a fun song.

01:04.020 --> 01:06.196
I mean,
who-who wouldn't wake up

01:06.240 --> 01:08.111
on the right side of the bed
to this song?

01:08.155 --> 01:09.373
Well, I didn't wake up

01:09.417 --> 01:10.722
on the right side of the bed
to that song.

01:10.766 --> 01:13.856
I woke up to a six-foot-four
grinning busybody.

01:13.899 --> 01:15.858
Okay, is that how we greet
the morning, Bon?

01:15.901 --> 01:18.165
I-I came to let y'all know,

01:18.208 --> 01:21.037
uh, we are having breakfast
at The Side Step.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.343
- Oh.
- And y'all are coming.

01:22.386 --> 01:23.866
Uh, Liam's already on his way.

01:23.909 --> 01:25.389
That's a nice idea.

01:25.433 --> 01:26.825
Is it a special occasion?

01:26.869 --> 01:28.218
No, not a one.

01:28.262 --> 01:31.134
Other than the fact that
your refrigerator is broken.

01:31.178 --> 01:32.266
What?

01:32.309 --> 01:33.267
- Yeah.
- How'd you break my fridge?

01:33.310 --> 01:34.485
Miss anything good?

01:36.096 --> 01:37.271
No, not since last night

01:37.314 --> 01:38.837
when Cordell said
the fire was his fault.

01:38.881 --> 01:41.275
That the kind of dirt you're
looking for on the Walkers?

01:41.318 --> 01:43.233
Who started a barn fire?

01:43.277 --> 01:45.235
Think that's gonna give you
the upper hand

01:45.279 --> 01:46.497
in your family feud,

01:46.541 --> 01:48.238
impress your wife,
fix your marriage?

01:48.282 --> 01:51.285
You got cameras
on my family now?

01:52.286 --> 01:53.939
Uh, breakfast means a lot...

01:53.983 --> 01:56.638
Appointment with
Dr. Crockett and Denise.

01:56.681 --> 01:58.118
3:00 p.m.

01:58.944 --> 02:01.164
Unless you take your wife
with you for bloodwork,

02:01.208 --> 02:04.080
sounds like you're going
to marriage counseling.

02:04.820 --> 02:06.865
Maybe don't leave
your phone lying around.

02:06.909 --> 02:09.129
- Yeah. All right, get dressed.

02:10.956 --> 02:12.393
His heart's in the right place.

02:12.436 --> 02:13.785
Aw, well, hell.

02:13.829 --> 02:15.352
We got to go all the way
to The Side Step to eat?

02:15.396 --> 02:18.007
- He's your son.
- Yeah,
I know he's my son.

02:26.494 --> 02:27.843
Hey, whoa.

02:27.886 --> 02:29.366
I just came to say bye

02:29.410 --> 02:31.107
before I head to the school.
Are you...

02:31.151 --> 02:32.326
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

02:32.369 --> 02:34.328
I'm just running late, again,

02:34.371 --> 02:35.590
but I'm-I'm fine,
I'm fine.

02:35.633 --> 02:37.809
You forgetting something?

02:39.594 --> 02:41.291
Oh.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.778
I'll be home,
uh, later.

02:49.821 --> 02:52.215
Yeah.

02:53.869 --> 02:55.958
All right, here's the,
- uh, here's the bacon.
- Put it here.

02:56.001 --> 02:58.221
I have something, uh,
very important to share

02:58.265 --> 03:00.397
with y'all.
I'm gonna wait until...

03:00.441 --> 03:01.746
Uncle Liam gets here.

03:01.790 --> 03:03.444
That doesn't sound ominous.

03:03.487 --> 03:06.882
Ooh, "ominous." Yeah. Someone's
SAT prep courses are paying off.

03:06.925 --> 03:08.492
Hey, I utilized "ominous"

03:08.536 --> 03:10.146
prior to prep.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.495
Liam, hey!

03:11.539 --> 03:12.670
Hope y'all didn't wait
for me to start eating.

03:12.714 --> 03:14.281
I already got
my green juice, though.

03:14.324 --> 03:17.284
Luckily, Saturday is
my cheat day, so...

03:17.327 --> 03:19.764
Hey! Bacon isn't a cheat.

03:19.808 --> 03:21.331
It's a lifestyle.

03:24.943 --> 03:26.293
So, what's the big news,
big brother?

03:26.336 --> 03:29.774
There-There's a camera hidden
in our home.

03:31.167 --> 03:33.865
It's like a...
like a scavenger hunt?

03:33.909 --> 03:35.345
Did you put in
a security system?

03:35.389 --> 03:36.999
I don't need a stinking
security system...
Oh.

03:37.042 --> 03:38.609
You brought me down here
for a scavenger hunt.

03:40.045 --> 03:41.003
Okay, okay, okay.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

03:41.046 --> 03:41.830
Stop, please.
Please, please.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.310
Listen.

03:44.136 --> 03:46.791
What I'm saying is that...

03:46.835 --> 03:50.055
somebody or-or-or "somebodies,"

03:50.099 --> 03:52.319
um, broke into the ranch

03:52.362 --> 03:55.104
and hid a surveillance camera--

03:55.147 --> 03:57.541
uh, likely more than one--

03:57.585 --> 03:59.456
in our home, to spy on us.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.023
When did you learn this?

04:01.066 --> 04:02.285
Last night, after-after...

04:02.329 --> 04:03.373
You let us sleep at home

04:03.417 --> 04:04.983
after you found
a spy camera?

04:05.027 --> 04:06.637
The day I take my SATs?

04:06.681 --> 04:08.378
I needed to make sure
you were all safe.

04:08.422 --> 04:09.510
And now I'm a step ahead of

04:09.553 --> 04:10.902
whoever's watching our home,

04:10.946 --> 04:12.817
a-and I can get
to the bottom of this.

04:12.861 --> 04:16.604
Plus, I have a decent idea
of who is responsible.

04:16.647 --> 04:19.302
I hope the Davidsons are
on your list of suspects.

04:19.346 --> 04:20.303
The Davidsons?

04:20.347 --> 04:22.087
Gale Davidson stood right there.

04:22.131 --> 04:23.524
She made us out as jerks

04:23.567 --> 04:25.439
in front of the entire community
at the chili cook-off

04:25.482 --> 04:26.657
last night.

04:26.701 --> 04:27.876
So it would stand to reason

04:27.919 --> 04:29.965
that she would want
more dirt on us.

04:30.008 --> 04:32.359
What better way to do that
than to hide cameras

04:32.402 --> 04:34.056
in our home?
Yeah.

04:34.099 --> 04:36.667
Hey, Liam. Can I,
can I chat with you for a sec?

04:36.711 --> 04:37.973
Okay.

04:38.016 --> 04:39.888
Yep.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.021
- What?

04:45.110 --> 04:47.852
I don't need you to add fuel
to this dumpster fire

04:47.896 --> 04:50.812
of a family feud
in front of my kids.

04:50.855 --> 04:53.554
Besides, the person
behind this is Serano.

04:53.597 --> 04:56.252
Oh, really? You know, we never
found anything in his warehouse

04:56.296 --> 04:58.428
that would suggest that he's
using hidden surveillance, okay?

04:58.472 --> 05:00.343
That's not his M.O.,
but it could be

05:00.387 --> 05:02.258
- the Davidsons' M.O.
- They're
our neighbors, Liam.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.129
They're not
some crime syndicate.

05:04.173 --> 05:05.914
Oh, you know what, you know
what, you always do this.

05:05.957 --> 05:07.219
Do what?
You always

05:07.263 --> 05:08.264
give Denise
the benefit of the doubt.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.700
I'm not giving...Never me.

05:09.744 --> 05:11.528
Hey!

05:11.572 --> 05:12.921
Boys.

05:12.964 --> 05:14.314
Enough.

05:15.358 --> 05:17.229
Yeah, Mama. Of course, yeah.
Yeah.

05:17.273 --> 05:20.755
Um, here's
what needs to happen, um...

05:20.798 --> 05:24.933
We all have to stay away
from the ranch

05:24.976 --> 05:26.282
until I figure this out.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.588
Yeah?

05:27.631 --> 05:29.503
And I will figure this out.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.374
I'll-I'll figure this out
by going after the people

05:31.418 --> 05:34.290
actually responsible.

05:35.552 --> 05:37.772
Great, great.

05:37.815 --> 05:39.382
Eat up.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.788
You know, this-this prep course
that you took i-is great.

05:53.831 --> 05:56.094
It helped me ace my verbal,
so...

05:56.138 --> 05:58.270
You know what, don't-don't
think about anything

05:58.314 --> 05:59.750
that we talked about
at breakfast

05:59.794 --> 06:01.709
today, just try and focus

06:01.752 --> 06:03.885
- on that test.
- Yeah.

06:03.928 --> 06:07.105
"Focus."
Keen choice of words.

06:08.498 --> 06:10.282
I'm-I'm sorry.

06:10.326 --> 06:12.894
I didn't mean to make you
think about the cameras.

06:12.937 --> 06:14.896
Good luck.

06:17.812 --> 06:20.423
Whoo! I got a real good feeling
about today.

06:20.467 --> 06:23.078
Or should I say I got
a real well feeling?

06:23.121 --> 06:24.427
How about you, Stel?

06:24.471 --> 06:28.213
Um, I feel like
I'm going to fail,

06:28.257 --> 06:31.391
and ruin my life, and be
stuck on a cursed ranch

06:31.434 --> 06:34.176
where the sky's falling,
and I can't even say why

06:34.219 --> 06:36.265
'cause it's, like,
confidential.

06:36.308 --> 06:38.920
Wow, I literally went through
that exact thing

06:38.963 --> 06:40.312
first time I took the SATs.

06:40.356 --> 06:42.053
Just take it
one problem at a time.

06:42.097 --> 06:44.055
You can't get
every question right,

06:44.099 --> 06:46.841
but I promise you'll get some.

06:48.538 --> 06:51.149
Hey, how quick you think you can
wipe down those tables?

06:51.193 --> 06:52.977
Gramps, come on,
I'm not a kid anymore.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.326
You can just ask me to clean.

06:55.806 --> 06:57.286
Two minutes.

06:57.329 --> 06:58.461
Easy.

07:01.159 --> 07:03.727
Everything all right?
Yeah.

07:03.771 --> 07:06.338
Uh...

07:06.382 --> 07:09.167
I just saw the mock-up
for the new menu.

07:09.951 --> 07:11.300
Gale Davidson's
Barn Burner Chili.

07:11.343 --> 07:13.128
I can't believe he put that
on there.

07:13.171 --> 07:16.000
You're not letting this get
under your skin, are you?

07:16.044 --> 07:17.524
Well, it aggravates
the hell out of me.

07:19.917 --> 07:21.397
It's not just that.
It's everything.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.964
It's...

07:23.007 --> 07:25.314
I don't know, Liam getting shot,
Hoyt's death.

07:25.357 --> 07:26.794
I'm lucky to be standing here
myself

07:26.837 --> 07:28.448
after the whole health scare.

07:29.623 --> 07:32.016
Then maybe it's time we take
a hard look at

07:32.060 --> 07:33.888
what's tying us to the ranch.

07:35.759 --> 07:37.674
What are you saying?

07:37.718 --> 07:39.981
The ranch is our legacy.

07:40.024 --> 07:42.157
And it's a beautiful one.

07:42.940 --> 07:44.594
But do we really
want to spend

07:44.638 --> 07:46.161
our golden years someplace

07:46.204 --> 07:47.989
that's under surveillance?

07:48.032 --> 07:49.686
Or attack?

07:51.296 --> 07:53.560
Or with neighbors
who are trying to tear us apart?

07:55.562 --> 07:58.347
Don't we owe it to ourselves
to, at least,

07:58.390 --> 08:00.480
consider something different?

08:00.523 --> 08:01.872
What about the boys?

08:01.916 --> 08:04.527
Well, they have lives
of their own.

08:04.571 --> 08:05.833
And have they ever shown

08:05.876 --> 08:07.748
even the slightest bit
of interest?

08:07.791 --> 08:08.792
Done!

08:08.836 --> 08:10.011
Were you timing that?

08:10.054 --> 08:11.273
Did I, uh...

08:11.316 --> 08:12.927
Did I get that in time?

08:13.884 --> 08:15.538
Of course you did.

08:15.582 --> 08:18.062
Still got it.

08:21.283 --> 08:22.850
<i>My office is struggling</i>

08:22.893 --> 08:25.374
with charges against Serano
that'll stick.

08:25.417 --> 08:26.506
Morning.

08:26.549 --> 08:28.464
Welcome back, Ramirez.

08:29.857 --> 08:31.249
Can you, uh...

08:34.339 --> 08:35.558
D.A. Miller was
just filling me in

08:35.602 --> 08:37.168
on the case
against Thomas Serano.

08:37.212 --> 08:38.387
- Right.
- In short, it's thin.

08:38.430 --> 08:39.997
Our criminal informant
Garrison Murphy

08:40.041 --> 08:41.259
was going to testify,

08:41.303 --> 08:42.347
but his death leaves us

08:42.391 --> 08:43.871
little to go on.

08:43.914 --> 08:45.220
I know we haven't
had much luck

08:45.263 --> 08:46.613
flipping Serano's enforcers

08:46.656 --> 08:48.876
that I identified
while undercover,

08:48.919 --> 08:51.008
but Walker might
have something.

08:51.052 --> 08:52.836
Something that gets us
RICO charges

08:52.880 --> 08:54.185
on Serano?

08:54.229 --> 08:56.187
- I want life behind bars.
- Yeah, well, uh,

08:56.231 --> 08:57.885
last night,
I-I discovered

08:57.928 --> 09:00.714
a surveillance camera
hidden in our home.

09:00.757 --> 09:02.280
- Not mine.
- What?

09:02.324 --> 09:03.760
- Is your family okay?
- They're safe, Cap.

09:05.762 --> 09:09.113
Okay, uh, what makes you think
that Serano's behind it?

09:09.157 --> 09:10.506
The way he addressed me.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.900
Uh, i-it felt like
a little too familiar,

09:12.943 --> 09:14.162
considering we had never met.

09:14.205 --> 09:15.729
That and the way

09:15.772 --> 09:18.340
Stan Morrison said
I was being watched.

09:18.383 --> 09:20.211
Okay, so all roads lead
to Serano.

09:20.255 --> 09:22.562
Hopefully the way you played it
still leaves us

09:22.605 --> 09:23.867
a step ahead of him,

09:23.911 --> 09:25.913
wherever his guys
are watching from.

09:25.956 --> 09:27.567
I'll confirm,
but that transmission is

09:27.610 --> 09:28.785
probably encrypted.

09:28.829 --> 09:30.526
Right, so there's
no way to track the signal

09:30.570 --> 09:32.702
to whoever's watching.

09:32.746 --> 09:34.965
Right,
but we could lure them out.

09:35.009 --> 09:36.924
And if it is one of
Serano's guys, then...

09:36.967 --> 09:40.057
We can pressure him to testify
against Serano. Yeah.

09:40.101 --> 09:41.015
Right.

09:41.058 --> 09:42.625
Yeah, that all
sounds great,

09:42.669 --> 09:45.497
but exactly how do we
lure them out?

09:46.324 --> 09:47.891
I have an idea.

09:47.935 --> 09:50.938
It's a little twist on
something I read you two did

09:50.981 --> 09:52.809
while you were partners.

09:53.680 --> 09:54.768
The Bodie...

09:54.811 --> 09:56.073
Bodie-- Bodie Gambit?
Bodie Gambit.

09:56.117 --> 09:57.379
The Bodie Gambit.

09:57.422 --> 09:58.598
- Bodie Gambit.
- Bodie Gambit.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.643
Yes.
Yes.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.602
D.A. Miller,

10:02.645 --> 10:03.820
I like the way you think.

10:03.864 --> 10:05.822
I'm sure I do, too.

10:05.866 --> 10:07.041
But can someone please

10:07.084 --> 10:09.391
explain to me
the Bodie Gambit?

10:33.067 --> 10:34.459
Denise?
Hi.

10:34.503 --> 10:37.027
Uh, what-what are you
doing here?

10:37.071 --> 10:38.855
- Are you alone?
- Yeah.

10:38.899 --> 10:40.465
Uh, just-just-just me.

10:40.509 --> 10:43.207
"Denise,
what are you doing here?"

10:43.251 --> 10:44.861
Wow.

10:44.905 --> 10:47.690
My partner's definitely not
winning an Oscar anytime soon.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.039
She's good, though.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.911
You're gonna want to see this.

10:50.954 --> 10:52.129
Uh, I always do.

10:52.173 --> 10:54.088
I know. Not yet.

10:54.131 --> 10:56.090
Look, we recovered

10:56.133 --> 10:58.701
this hard drive
from Serano's safe house,

10:58.745 --> 11:00.442
and I'm the only one
who's seen what's on it.

11:00.485 --> 11:03.967
I know you've been searching
for a smoking gun

11:04.011 --> 11:06.491
to link Serano
to Northside Nation.

11:06.535 --> 11:08.363
Is that it?

11:08.406 --> 11:10.582
There's enough evidence on here

11:10.626 --> 11:14.238
to put him away
for 15 life sentences.

11:14.282 --> 11:16.023
I'll get the champagne.

11:16.066 --> 11:19.200
Keep the drone high
so it's not spotted.

11:19.243 --> 11:21.550
All right. Thanks, guys.

11:21.593 --> 11:22.856
We always do.

11:22.899 --> 11:25.075
Okay, just cool it there, Romeo.

11:25.119 --> 11:26.207
Hmm.

11:26.250 --> 11:27.599
There's still
the outstanding matter

11:27.643 --> 11:30.080
of everything else
that you and I did in Del Rio

11:30.124 --> 11:32.343
that could come
to light at trial.

11:32.387 --> 11:33.736
This is the Bodie Gambit?

11:33.780 --> 11:35.695
You and Walker pretended
to have an affair?

11:35.738 --> 11:36.565
No.

11:36.608 --> 11:37.697
We acted like crooked cops.

11:37.740 --> 11:39.002
We lured a drug dealer
out of hiding

11:39.046 --> 11:40.525
to steal some meth from us.

11:40.569 --> 11:42.005
Well, then why are they
laying on the chemistry

11:42.049 --> 11:43.441
so thick in there?

11:43.485 --> 11:44.791
You got to sell the performance.
You know that.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.444
Look, these two, they have--
they got history.

11:46.488 --> 11:49.056
They have familiarity.
They're just using it.

11:49.099 --> 11:50.057
I thought you, um,

11:50.100 --> 11:52.624
I-I thought you...

11:52.668 --> 11:55.279
covered our trail
with-with a search warrant.

11:55.323 --> 11:56.759
I did, I had my friend

11:56.803 --> 11:59.066
at the courthouse
forge the signature

11:59.109 --> 12:00.850
Great.
so that it'll be
legit in court...

12:00.894 --> 12:03.244
Get me another SSD card
to back this up.

12:05.246 --> 12:07.074
Dan.

12:07.117 --> 12:09.946
Hey. Come here.

12:09.990 --> 12:11.295
Apologies.

12:11.339 --> 12:15.212
I got lost thinking how Serano's
gonna reward me

12:15.256 --> 12:17.780
for getting his criminal charges
tossed.

12:17.824 --> 12:20.217
But I forgot you're watching
your wife cuckold you.

12:20.261 --> 12:21.610
Watch your mouth.

12:21.653 --> 12:23.786
Word of advice, Danny.

12:23.830 --> 12:27.007
Some men talk, others act.

12:27.050 --> 12:29.792
Walker knows which
your wife responds to.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.141
Do you?

12:31.185 --> 12:32.882
I do.

12:32.926 --> 12:35.145
It'll get a little too warm.

12:35.189 --> 12:37.452
Mm.

12:37.495 --> 12:39.933
What is...

12:40.803 --> 12:42.326
Who are those two?

12:42.370 --> 12:44.807
Two DPS drone surveillance
operators.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.504
No, they're not,
because DPS doesn't authorize

12:46.548 --> 12:47.767
eyes in the sky that quickly...

12:47.810 --> 12:49.420
Nah, I'm just covering
all our bases.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.640
Sara over there,
she runs DPS drone ops,

12:51.683 --> 12:53.120
and she was in my Army unit.

12:53.163 --> 12:55.426
And I called and asked
for a favor.

12:55.470 --> 12:57.298
I'm sorry,
why are you celebrating?

12:58.125 --> 12:59.604
I'm celebrating
because your wife

12:59.648 --> 13:01.955
will be disbarred for everything
she's admitted on camera

13:01.998 --> 13:03.826
and won't be able to prosecute
my boss.

13:03.870 --> 13:06.742
It sounds like any prosecutor
is gonna be able to use

13:06.786 --> 13:10.180
the evidence on that hard drive
to prosecute your boss.

13:10.224 --> 13:12.966
And that would leave you
in the lurch, now, wouldn't it?

13:13.009 --> 13:16.491
You've lost the thread, Danny.

13:16.534 --> 13:19.494
'Cause when the Ranger sneaks
to the bedroom with your wife,

13:19.537 --> 13:21.844
I sneak in and steal
that hard drive.

13:21.888 --> 13:24.412
But, hey,
there's a silver lining.

13:24.455 --> 13:27.023
You finally got
more dirt on Walker.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.851
He's banging your wife.

13:35.771 --> 13:38.687
How would you feel about ironing
out the last of the details

13:38.730 --> 13:40.428
at the Driskill Hotel?

13:40.471 --> 13:42.996
Well, um...

13:43.039 --> 13:45.128
You didn't waste any time
getting back in gear.

13:45.172 --> 13:46.042
I'm impressed.

13:46.086 --> 13:47.827
Thank you, Cap.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.176
We got a problem.

13:49.219 --> 13:50.568
It's a vehicle headed

13:50.612 --> 13:51.918
toward Walker Ranch.

13:51.961 --> 13:53.571
We can't intervene
without blowing our cover.

13:53.615 --> 13:56.226
Or Walker and Denise's cover.
Best we can do is warn them.

13:57.010 --> 13:58.576
Hey, heads up, guys.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.361
Y'all got a visitor.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.232
Are you expecting company?

14:02.276 --> 14:04.060
Wait in the kitchen.

14:12.982 --> 14:14.897
- Cordi?
- Geri!

14:14.941 --> 14:16.638
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey!

14:16.681 --> 14:19.467
Abby know you're doing

14:19.510 --> 14:21.164
- handiwork around here?
- Yeah.

14:21.208 --> 14:22.905
- Yeah.
- Yeah, 'cause the last time
I saw you wearing that,

14:22.949 --> 14:24.515
The Side Step's walls collapsed.

14:24.559 --> 14:26.126
Okay, yeah, no, no.
We, uh...

14:26.169 --> 14:28.041
We just...Hey, by the way,

14:28.084 --> 14:32.349
what was up with Gale Davison's
insane victory speech

14:32.393 --> 14:33.350
at the chili cook-off?

14:33.394 --> 14:34.351
It was fine, you know...Oh, oh.

14:34.395 --> 14:35.831
By the way,

14:35.875 --> 14:37.311
new record.

14:37.354 --> 14:39.313
Six phone numbers
for you in the tip jar.

14:39.356 --> 14:40.314
I mean...
M-Me?

14:40.357 --> 14:42.272
Hey, uh...

14:42.316 --> 14:44.100
I got a lot
going on right now.

14:44.144 --> 14:45.580
Uh, not a good time.

14:45.623 --> 14:48.104
You mind if I come back
by the bar later,
Oh.

14:48.148 --> 14:49.671
and we chat, catch up?

14:49.714 --> 14:51.151
Oh, uh...

14:51.194 --> 14:52.152
Okay.

14:52.195 --> 14:53.370
Uh...
Great.

14:53.414 --> 14:55.155
Great.
You know what?

14:55.198 --> 14:56.896
- I'm just gonna say something.
- Okay.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.506
I'm gonna say it because I,

14:58.549 --> 14:59.811
you know...

14:59.855 --> 15:01.204
this is something that
I've been wanting to say

15:01.248 --> 15:02.553
for a little while,
and, you know.
Okay.

15:02.597 --> 15:05.121
- Uh, maybe-maybe I'm off on this.
- Yeah.

15:05.165 --> 15:07.123
Can we sit down for a second?

15:07.167 --> 15:08.995
Well, um, you know, I...Geraldine?

15:09.038 --> 15:10.387
Mm.
Good to see you.

15:10.431 --> 15:11.954
How are you?

15:11.998 --> 15:14.043
You, uh...
You-you know, uh,

15:14.087 --> 15:15.827
Denise and, um, you know...

15:15.871 --> 15:16.654
Thank you so much

15:16.698 --> 15:18.656
for working the cook-off.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.789
That was really great.
Um, what are you...

15:20.832 --> 15:22.878
- What are you doing here?
- Um...

15:25.533 --> 15:26.708
I'm so sorry.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.405
I did not mean to interrupt...

15:28.449 --> 15:29.972
Oh, no....whatever's going on.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.887
There's no-nothing going on.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.671
No, no.
She's right, she's right.

15:33.715 --> 15:35.151
I mean, this is a--
it's a private moment.

15:35.195 --> 15:36.674
Cordell, you dog.

15:36.718 --> 15:38.894
Okay, um, I'll see you later.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.243
- Yeah, yeah.
- I'll get my things.
I'll see you later.

15:40.287 --> 15:42.245
- Bye.
- Bye.

15:42.289 --> 15:44.204
- There's an explanation, okay?
- Yeah, you don't have to
explain anything.

15:44.247 --> 15:45.727
You don't owe me
anything.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.772
I-I know, but I-I want to have
that conversation.

15:47.816 --> 15:49.165
Get her out of there.

15:49.209 --> 15:51.472
That was awkward.Geri, that's not...

15:51.515 --> 15:52.995
The hard drive is inside.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.650
Use this opportunity
to get out of there now.

15:55.693 --> 15:57.130
Um...I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.

15:57.173 --> 15:58.392
W-W-W-Wait.

15:58.435 --> 15:59.393
- Cordi?
Yeah?

15:59.436 --> 16:01.134
LBJ Suite's waiting.

16:04.485 --> 16:07.140
Okay. Uh...

16:08.750 --> 16:10.317
Great.

16:10.360 --> 16:11.666
- Let's get to it.
- Yeah.

16:11.709 --> 16:14.147
Let's go. Okay.

16:24.766 --> 16:25.854
Oh.

16:25.897 --> 16:28.291
What a performance.

16:28.335 --> 16:30.467
I mean, I feel like
we pulled that off, right?

16:30.511 --> 16:31.947
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.123
That-that, uh,
felt pretty good.

16:34.167 --> 16:35.516
Um...

16:35.559 --> 16:36.996
What you got there, Mick?

16:37.039 --> 16:38.127
Ah, first day back,
your partner's setting records

16:38.171 --> 16:40.956
for fastest DPS
surveillance drone setup.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.784
Yeah.

16:42.827 --> 16:45.482
Definitely feels good to have
Micki back in the field.

16:45.526 --> 16:49.747
Yeah, I figured it could
give us a jump on our watcher.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.140
I ran with Serano's crew
for three months,

16:51.184 --> 16:52.881
so whoever this guy is,
he'll be ruthless.

16:52.924 --> 16:56.537
He will not hesitate to drop
anyone who gets in his way,

16:56.580 --> 16:59.105
so we need to be prepared
for anything.

16:59.148 --> 17:01.846
All right.

17:04.936 --> 17:07.635
Ten minutes left
on this section.

17:24.565 --> 17:26.262
You know, putting on that
little act in there made me

17:26.306 --> 17:27.916
kind of nostalgic for when
we used to play house

17:27.959 --> 17:29.396
when we were kids.

17:29.439 --> 17:32.225
Wait.
I don't remember playing house.

17:32.268 --> 17:35.054
I remember playing
- astronaut, you know.
- What? You were an astronaut

17:35.097 --> 17:37.447
at home on Earth with his wife,

17:37.491 --> 17:40.276
which is commonly referred to
as playing house.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.061
Oh, mm...

17:42.104 --> 17:43.845
Yeah. Uh-huh.

17:43.888 --> 17:45.803
Oh, sorry.
One second.

17:45.847 --> 17:48.241
- This is my office.
- Yeah, of course.

17:48.284 --> 17:50.939
This is Denise. Yes...

17:53.159 --> 17:54.725
Hey.
Hey.

17:54.769 --> 17:57.206
Do you... do you want me to
ask James to talk to her?

17:57.250 --> 18:00.296
She doesn't need to be here
if she's a distraction.

18:00.340 --> 18:02.646
Is there some reason
you don't want her here?

18:02.690 --> 18:04.039
I just thought it could
help you focus.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.215
Help us all focus.

18:06.259 --> 18:08.478
Do I not seem focused?

18:08.522 --> 18:11.177
You know, confined area.

18:11.220 --> 18:13.309
I can't help but overhear...

18:13.353 --> 18:16.051
Playing house...

18:16.095 --> 18:19.446
Listen, I-I'm sympathetic
to what you went through.

18:19.489 --> 18:22.318
I am. And I imagine

18:22.362 --> 18:23.972
it must be difficult
to see me reconnecting

18:24.015 --> 18:25.104
with someone from my past.

18:25.147 --> 18:27.149
Well, are you kidding me
with this?

18:27.193 --> 18:29.891
This has nothing to do
with Garrison.

18:30.761 --> 18:33.677
Listen, I just came over to say

18:33.721 --> 18:35.418
we've got a good shot
at pulling this off,

18:35.462 --> 18:37.420
and I don't want anything
that could put us in danger

18:37.464 --> 18:40.162
- by distracting us.
- Agreed.

18:40.206 --> 18:41.859
That's all.

18:41.903 --> 18:43.731
Okay?

18:56.222 --> 18:58.572
You look upset.

19:00.095 --> 19:01.923
Stel, what's wrong?

19:03.142 --> 19:05.361
Nothing's wrong.

19:05.405 --> 19:07.798
I'm just...
I'm coming to terms

19:07.842 --> 19:11.193
with my crap life
stuck on a crap ranch

19:11.237 --> 19:15.458
where-where crap happens that
I can't even talk about.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.591
I know what it's like
to feel like

19:17.634 --> 19:19.941
you can't talk about something
that's bothering you.

19:19.984 --> 19:22.552
I'm dating a Ranger, remember?

19:22.596 --> 19:26.382
I'm familiar with the whole
"confidential" thing.

19:26.426 --> 19:30.256
Ah, I'm acing this.
How about...

19:31.735 --> 19:35.652
I gotta go to the bathroom.

19:38.089 --> 19:40.309
Listen, Stel,

19:40.353 --> 19:42.877
even when it feels like
all is lost,

19:42.920 --> 19:45.575
and even the people closest
to you can't help,

19:45.619 --> 19:48.709
you just have to
give it time.

19:48.752 --> 19:51.973
Time washes away
even the worst setbacks.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.542
What the hell?

19:55.585 --> 19:59.328
Time and sprinklers,
apparently.

20:01.722 --> 20:05.334
Leave your papers
on your desk.

20:05.378 --> 20:07.380
Liam. Hey!

20:07.423 --> 20:08.772
No one thought to
give me a call?

20:08.816 --> 20:10.861
No one thought to invite me
to this party?

20:10.905 --> 20:12.646
What a way to make
a guy feel wanted.

20:12.689 --> 20:14.822
- It's not a party.
- I'm kidding, of course.

20:14.865 --> 20:16.519
Connie filled me in.

20:16.563 --> 20:19.130
- Great.
- And a good afternoon
to you, Liam.

20:19.174 --> 20:20.219
Hey, Captain James.

20:20.262 --> 20:22.046
Micki, good to see you back.

20:22.090 --> 20:23.265
Liam, we were just trying to

20:23.309 --> 20:24.788
keep our stakeout
footprint small.

20:24.832 --> 20:26.442
We weren't trying
- to leave you out.
- Oh, that's fine.

20:26.486 --> 20:28.314
We're all good.
Uh, Cordell,

20:28.357 --> 20:29.880
can I talk to you for a second?

20:29.924 --> 20:31.360
Yeah, of course.

20:31.404 --> 20:34.711
Just a sec.
Hey, what's up?

20:34.755 --> 20:36.452
I've been researching
these surveillance cameras,

20:36.496 --> 20:38.324
like the ones at our
ranch. Cams that

20:38.367 --> 20:40.456
can transmit over
encrypted feeds.

20:41.283 --> 20:43.372
If these cameras aren't
transmitting over Wi-Fi--

20:43.416 --> 20:44.982
and I already checked,
they're not--

20:45.026 --> 20:46.767
it means that they're
transmitting

20:46.810 --> 20:48.595
over a local receiver,
which means

20:48.638 --> 20:52.338
whoever's watching us is close.

20:56.429 --> 20:58.474
Okay, there's no other
explanation?

20:58.518 --> 20:59.823
I mean, there is
one other possibility,

20:59.867 --> 21:02.043
but the tech said
that it's unlikely.

21:02.086 --> 21:03.392
That the cameras could relay

21:03.436 --> 21:05.742
to another surveillance
setup nearby,

21:05.786 --> 21:07.483
but the same principle
would have to apply.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.311
- It would have to be close.
- Wait.

21:09.355 --> 21:10.443
Are you saying that
there's another

21:10.486 --> 21:12.488
surveillance setup nearby?

21:12.532 --> 21:15.186
It's a-- It's a scenario
that we're

21:15.230 --> 21:16.579
kind of working with.

21:16.623 --> 21:18.102
It's unlikely, but...Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

21:18.146 --> 21:21.018
If Serano is keeping tabs
on your family,

21:21.062 --> 21:22.542
wouldn't he want to do
the same thing

21:22.585 --> 21:23.934
to the D.A. that's
prosecuting him?

21:23.978 --> 21:26.894
Wouldn't he be keeping tabs
on me, too?

21:26.937 --> 21:28.852
Uh, that is--
That's why I'm here,

21:28.896 --> 21:33.553
is that we have to...
we have to check your home.

21:33.596 --> 21:36.295
Okay, but wouldn't that
tip off whoever's watching

21:36.338 --> 21:38.906
if we just walk in
- and start looking around?
- Okay, then we perform.

21:38.949 --> 21:40.690
Like we just did at my place.

21:40.734 --> 21:43.954
You know, we-we act like
we're catching up while

21:43.998 --> 21:45.347
discreetly looking
for hidden cameras.

21:45.391 --> 21:46.566
Well, time is of the essence.

21:46.609 --> 21:47.697
We may have already given them
a head start

21:47.741 --> 21:48.872
clearing cameras
from your ranch.

21:48.916 --> 21:51.919
All right.
But I should go in first.

21:51.962 --> 21:53.573
It'll be too suspicious

21:53.616 --> 21:55.575
- if we arrive at the same time.
- Fine. That's fine, yeah. Great.

21:55.618 --> 21:58.142
I'll come in later,
a-and,

21:58.186 --> 22:00.231
you know,
I'll just act like,

22:00.275 --> 22:02.277
you know, I'm stopping by

22:02.321 --> 22:04.497
on the way home from work.
You know?

22:06.673 --> 22:07.891
Look, we gotta move on this.

22:07.935 --> 22:09.676
Now. Denise, are you sure
you're good?

22:09.719 --> 22:11.242
It's our only option.

22:11.286 --> 22:12.896
Yeah. Fine.

22:12.940 --> 22:14.463
All right, I'm taking off.

22:14.507 --> 22:16.378
Whoa. Whoa!

22:16.422 --> 22:18.119
I know how to get out of here
without being seen.

22:18.162 --> 22:21.818
I know. I'm just wondering
where you're going.

22:21.862 --> 22:23.298
The bank, I hope.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.995
You still owe me for
my streaming service.

22:25.039 --> 22:26.301
I'll get you your money,
all right?

22:26.345 --> 22:29.217
Tell me you're not
meeting your wife

22:29.260 --> 22:30.349
for marriage counseling.

22:30.392 --> 22:33.395
After she was just
with that Ranger?

22:33.439 --> 22:35.571
If I were you, I wouldn't listen
to a word out of her mouth.

22:35.615 --> 22:38.269
I'd plug it and pull
- the trigger.
- I'm leaving.

22:38.313 --> 22:39.619
Stop.

22:39.662 --> 22:41.185
Your wife's meeting you there,
right?

22:41.229 --> 22:43.449
Call her. Act like
you're checking in

22:43.492 --> 22:45.015
to make sure
she'll be there.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.150
Call her now.

23:03.512 --> 23:05.296
Oh...

23:05.340 --> 23:07.386
Oh, my God.

23:07.429 --> 23:09.692
I am so sorry.
I forgot our appointment today.

23:09.736 --> 23:11.433
It was so crazy.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.261
Uh, it-it's fine.

23:13.304 --> 23:15.089
Um, where are you?

23:15.132 --> 23:16.786
I'm pulling up at home.

23:16.830 --> 23:18.353
But don't come here, okay?

23:18.397 --> 23:20.486
I can't go into details
right now, but

23:20.529 --> 23:21.965
the Walkers have
surveillance on them,

23:22.009 --> 23:23.402
and I think we might, too.

23:25.969 --> 23:27.971
Okay.

23:28.015 --> 23:30.931
She's just driving to
the appointment; she's late.

23:30.974 --> 23:33.150
Where's Walker?

23:34.935 --> 23:37.154
Have you, uh,
have you seen Walker today?

23:37.198 --> 23:38.547
Yeah. He's helping me.

23:38.591 --> 23:41.115
Look, I gotta go.

23:41.158 --> 23:43.204
All right. Well,
thanks for letting me know.

23:43.247 --> 23:47.817
No, Dr. Crockett won't mind.
Don't rush.

23:47.861 --> 23:50.124
Okay, I'll see you there.

23:50.167 --> 23:52.866
She just left Walker
at the office.

23:52.909 --> 23:54.520
What I'm hearing is

23:54.563 --> 23:56.130
I got Walker Ranch
to myself,

23:56.173 --> 23:59.612
and you got something to
discuss at marriage counseling.

24:00.569 --> 24:01.962
Your wife's affair.

24:02.005 --> 24:04.747
Wait a minute. Hold it.

24:04.791 --> 24:08.447
The ranch is all clear,
so I'm going in now.

24:08.490 --> 24:09.926
But we can't leave the shed
at the same time.

24:09.970 --> 24:11.493
Raises the odds someone
spots us.

24:11.537 --> 24:13.016
So you gotta hang back.

24:50.271 --> 24:52.795
Maybe don't leave your phone
lying around.

25:27.787 --> 25:29.528
- Denise. Hey, it's me.
- Hey.

25:29.571 --> 25:31.051
I thought you might be home.

25:31.094 --> 25:34.010
Yeah, um, we're still
settling in, so...

25:34.054 --> 25:34.750
Okay, yeah.

25:34.794 --> 25:36.230
- This is great.
- Um...

25:36.273 --> 25:37.927
Why'd Walker go in so soon?

25:37.971 --> 25:39.625
I don't know.
That could look so suspicious

25:39.668 --> 25:40.930
to anyone who was watching.

25:40.974 --> 25:42.932
He must have a good reason.

25:42.976 --> 25:44.804
I thought you were
coming by later.

25:44.847 --> 25:46.762
Yeah, just, I haven't
seen this place

25:46.806 --> 25:48.808
since I was a kid, you know?

25:48.851 --> 25:51.593
A lot's changed.
Still beautiful.

25:51.637 --> 25:54.030
Yeah, a lot's changed
all right.

25:54.074 --> 25:56.293
Um, look, you are not
selling this very well.

25:56.337 --> 25:57.425
What's up with you?

25:57.468 --> 25:58.600
Is there something going on?

25:58.644 --> 26:00.689
I mean, anything you
want to tell me?

26:00.733 --> 26:03.126
Spotted
a perp coming out of the woods,

26:03.170 --> 26:07.348
headed towards Walker Ranch.
We need to move now.

26:16.531 --> 26:18.881
Micki, what are you doing?
We wait for Walker,

26:18.925 --> 26:20.404
and then we surround the ranch;
that's the plan.

26:20.448 --> 26:21.710
Our perp will have already
taken the hard drive.

26:21.754 --> 26:24.147
We can't delay.
That's how people get killed.

26:24.191 --> 26:25.584
Ramirez, what--

26:25.627 --> 26:27.324
Hey, don't let what happened
in Del Rio affect

26:27.368 --> 26:29.936
what we're doing here. Stay put.

26:32.678 --> 26:34.505
Who the hell is that?

26:38.945 --> 26:40.990
Ramirez!

26:54.917 --> 26:56.353
Oh, no.

26:56.397 --> 26:57.746
Our perp must have
started a fire.

26:57.790 --> 27:00.531
Stay here.
It's too dangerous.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.736
Hold on.

28:16.607 --> 28:17.870
That's my warning shot.

28:20.307 --> 28:22.135
Leave me.

28:22.178 --> 28:25.660
Go. Help them. Go!

28:28.445 --> 28:29.838
Come out with your hands up.

28:29.882 --> 28:32.580
This place is surrounded
by Texas Rangers.

29:07.006 --> 29:09.312
Liam, behind you!

29:29.028 --> 29:33.293
Uh, I saw the fire
on the Walker property,

29:33.336 --> 29:36.296
and I was worried that
it was gonna spread.

29:36.339 --> 29:40.517
And that's when
I saw that man.

29:40.561 --> 29:43.912
And I realized that
he must have started the fire.

29:43.956 --> 29:47.263
He had a gun, and he was

29:47.307 --> 29:50.223
breaking into the house.

29:50.266 --> 29:53.835
So I, um...

29:53.879 --> 29:55.576
I followed him.

29:55.619 --> 30:00.102
That's when I heard
the gunshot, and I hid.

30:00.146 --> 30:03.976
I'm not proud of it.
The shot was so loud.

30:06.195 --> 30:09.329
And then I heard Liam
yell a warning,

30:09.372 --> 30:12.636
and I wanted to help him
so I, uh, I came out,

30:12.680 --> 30:15.683
and that's when I saw him
about to shoot him.

30:15.726 --> 30:17.076
I wasn't gonna
let that happen.

30:18.512 --> 30:21.515
I had to, um...

30:21.558 --> 30:23.865
I had to act.

30:23.909 --> 30:25.693
The deceased was a known
felon from Serano's crew.

30:25.736 --> 30:27.826
You were right, man.

30:27.869 --> 30:30.698
Shame we couldn't arrest him,
have him testify against Serano.

30:30.741 --> 30:34.354
Yeah, well,
you know, uh...

30:34.397 --> 30:37.400
it's fortunate no one else
had to die, you know.

30:45.887 --> 30:47.976
Thank you.

30:52.589 --> 30:55.854
I was impressed everything
you did today, to a point.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.073
I tried.

30:58.117 --> 30:59.988
Did everything I could.

31:00.032 --> 31:02.034
It just kind of seemed like

31:02.077 --> 31:04.384
you didn't want the past
to repeat itself.

31:04.427 --> 31:07.474
You know, like, uh...

31:07.517 --> 31:08.605
You got to Garrison too late.

31:08.649 --> 31:09.868
You didn't want it
to happen again.

31:09.911 --> 31:11.739
Cap, I di-I didn't
have a choice.

31:11.782 --> 31:14.481
Not in Del Rio, no, but today
you did, and today you rushed.

31:16.048 --> 31:18.615
You rushed back to work,
you rushed in the field,

31:18.659 --> 31:20.356
and I-I just...

31:20.400 --> 31:22.750
I'm beginning to think
that you...

31:22.793 --> 31:24.665
I need to take a step back.

31:24.708 --> 31:26.885
Working in the field

31:26.928 --> 31:29.148
isn't the only way
to make a difference.

31:30.366 --> 31:31.933
All right?

31:41.551 --> 31:42.813
Dan.

31:45.512 --> 31:46.730
Uh, you, uh...

31:46.774 --> 31:49.429
You did a-a...

31:49.472 --> 31:52.084
really good thing today
for-for my family.

31:52.127 --> 31:56.523
And I'm-I'm sorry
that I ever doubted you.

31:56.566 --> 31:58.655
I hope we can, uh...

31:58.699 --> 32:01.310
put any sort
of bad blood behind us.

32:16.325 --> 32:17.631
You think they'll be able
to salvage the footage?

32:17.674 --> 32:19.981
Because that way I could prove
that I did not eat

32:20.025 --> 32:21.722
that last piece of cheesecake
last week, all right?

32:23.071 --> 32:24.768
What's it gonna take
to get people to stop

32:24.812 --> 32:26.031
coming after this family?

32:26.074 --> 32:28.120
I swear to...

32:28.163 --> 32:29.599
We found something
when we opened up the walls.

32:29.643 --> 32:32.646
Appears unrelated to
the surveillance equipment.

32:32.689 --> 32:34.648
Does this belong to you?

32:34.691 --> 32:36.389
Well, that's the emblem
this family's used

32:36.432 --> 32:37.346
for generations.

32:37.390 --> 32:38.478
I believe it must belong to us.

32:38.521 --> 32:39.479
Thank you very much.

32:39.522 --> 32:40.915
Mm-hmm.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.134
My goodness, look at that.

32:42.177 --> 32:45.964
- What is that?
- This looks like a map.

32:49.184 --> 32:51.970
It's a map of our property.

32:52.013 --> 32:55.669
"Walker Ranch, belonging
to E.B. Walker."

32:55.712 --> 32:57.540
How about that.

32:59.281 --> 33:01.675
Look at how east looked.
Look at that.

33:12.077 --> 33:14.383
Thank you for your help earlier.

33:14.427 --> 33:16.864
Huh? What are you
talking about?

33:16.907 --> 33:19.867
Oh, please.
You see me upset in the hall,

33:19.910 --> 33:21.825
seconds later
the sprinklers go off,

33:21.869 --> 33:23.392
and the SATs are cancelled?

33:23.436 --> 33:25.873
Yeah, this sounds
like a word problem.

33:25.916 --> 33:27.918
Um, "C," plead the fifth.

33:27.962 --> 33:31.226
Try "D," all of the above.

33:31.270 --> 33:35.187
Hey, I know
what you sacrificed

33:35.230 --> 33:37.841
just to make me feel better.

33:37.885 --> 33:40.540
You ruined your own test
even though you were doing good.

33:40.583 --> 33:45.893
Well, I think it's, well,
"doing well," but...

33:49.070 --> 33:51.072
- Thank you.
- Bye.

33:52.769 --> 33:55.598
They, uh, really make you sweat
it out on those tests, huh?

33:55.642 --> 33:59.298
Uncle Liam, that's
really, really terrible.

33:59.341 --> 34:03.084
Yeah. I heard about
the sprinklers, though.

34:03.128 --> 34:04.868
Sorry, that's a tough
break, kiddo.

34:04.912 --> 34:06.740
I'll just take a rain check.

34:06.783 --> 34:10.222
Eh? Yeah? Yeah?

34:19.144 --> 34:20.580
Babe, what happened?

34:20.623 --> 34:22.538
- I'm fine.
- Hey, no, no, no.
Let me take a look.

34:22.582 --> 34:24.671
It's already cleaned
and dressed. I just...Let me just...

34:24.714 --> 34:26.325
You don't have to do that.

34:29.154 --> 34:31.112
You need time.

34:32.809 --> 34:35.073
I know.

34:35.116 --> 34:37.118
I've...

34:37.162 --> 34:38.815
I've just--
I've had a lot on my mind.

34:38.859 --> 34:41.122
Right.

34:41.166 --> 34:43.733
It's okay, Mick,
I understand.

34:43.777 --> 34:46.867
It's not.

34:46.910 --> 34:50.871
No, it's not.

34:50.914 --> 34:52.351
We're not.

34:55.615 --> 34:58.008
But we can be.

35:01.186 --> 35:05.320
There's just a lot...

35:05.364 --> 35:07.801
that I haven't dealt with.

35:07.844 --> 35:09.585
And I just

35:09.629 --> 35:11.805
pushed it down and...

35:11.848 --> 35:15.025
pushed you away, and...

35:15.069 --> 35:18.116
just threw myself
back into my job, but...

35:21.206 --> 35:24.122
I'm taking a step back
from work.

35:25.210 --> 35:28.126
It's what's best for me.

35:29.910 --> 35:32.434
Best for us.

35:35.220 --> 35:37.874
Come here.

35:37.918 --> 35:41.051
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

35:58.199 --> 36:00.201
You know, uh, Micki seemed okay.

36:00.245 --> 36:01.550
Yeah, once they
stitched her up.

36:01.594 --> 36:04.423
Yeah. But, I mean,
could've been worse, you know?

36:04.466 --> 36:08.078
Look at this.
Cou-could've been much worse.

36:08.122 --> 36:11.038
For you, too.
That was close, Liam.

36:11.081 --> 36:13.780
That was too close.
And, uh...

36:13.823 --> 36:15.608
you know, Dan Miller...

36:15.651 --> 36:17.392
Don't start

36:17.436 --> 36:19.655
about Dan Miller being a hero.

36:19.699 --> 36:21.091
He saved your life.

36:21.918 --> 36:23.268
Yeah.

36:25.270 --> 36:27.620
What was he doing on our
- property in the first place?
- He...

36:27.663 --> 36:29.361
He was trying to
put out a fire.

36:29.404 --> 36:31.145
And you don't think
that was just

36:31.189 --> 36:32.625
- a little bit too convenient?
- I think

36:32.668 --> 36:34.235
he was trying to help.

36:34.279 --> 36:38.065
Okay, Liam, I understand.
I really do.

36:38.108 --> 36:39.588
You're-you're jealous
of Denise...

36:39.632 --> 36:42.809
I'm not jealous. I have valid
doubts about that fam...

36:42.852 --> 36:44.463
About Dan? About Denise?

36:44.506 --> 36:47.248
Dan and Denise are not
the bad guys here.

36:47.292 --> 36:49.381
- Serano is the bad guy.
- Yeah, and

36:49.424 --> 36:51.165
the Davidsons
are just blameless.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.167
Today, yes.
I mean, have they

36:53.211 --> 36:54.386
made mistakes at
some point in their life?

36:54.429 --> 36:56.388
I'm sure they have, obviously.

36:56.431 --> 36:59.042
But maybe it's time we took
a long, hard look in the mirror

36:59.086 --> 37:02.524
and start considering
- our own faults.
- Faults?

37:02.568 --> 37:05.310
You want to talk about faults?
Hmm?

37:05.353 --> 37:08.182
What fault do I have

37:08.226 --> 37:10.576
in what happened today? Hmm?

37:11.925 --> 37:13.622
Okay, sure. Yeah, let's.

37:13.666 --> 37:17.931
Um... you thought
all along that Denise

37:17.974 --> 37:19.280
was behind the cameras.

37:19.324 --> 37:21.587
And you got me starting
to believe it, too.

37:21.630 --> 37:24.111
And I never should have
listened to you.

37:24.154 --> 37:26.244
- There. There it is.
- There what is?

37:29.203 --> 37:30.465
What?

37:31.336 --> 37:33.163
Your own brother.

37:34.295 --> 37:37.255
I...

37:37.298 --> 37:39.039
Hey.

37:39.082 --> 37:42.216
Hey. Thanks
for fixing

37:42.260 --> 37:43.783
- our fence.
- Yeah, yeah.

37:43.826 --> 37:47.613
Me and, uh, Liam.
The least we could do. Uh...

37:51.921 --> 37:54.707
Hey, Dan-- he uh...

37:54.750 --> 37:56.709
did a good thing.

37:56.752 --> 37:58.363
Um...

37:58.406 --> 38:01.583
and I want to
- talk to you about something.
- Hey, Cordell, don't.

38:01.627 --> 38:05.457
Okay? coming back here was
not to reopen old wounds.

38:05.500 --> 38:08.764
And it was really
nice to reminisce,

38:08.808 --> 38:12.202
but you actually thought
that my family could

38:12.246 --> 38:13.639
put cameras in your home.

38:13.682 --> 38:16.337
- I didn't, okay?
- Uh, stop. I saw it.

38:16.381 --> 38:18.861
You suspected me.

38:18.905 --> 38:21.429
How are we supposed to
work together after that?

38:21.473 --> 38:24.519
How are we supposed to anything
after that betrayal?

38:24.563 --> 38:27.827
I mean, I came
back to Austin

38:27.870 --> 38:29.785
for a lot of reasons.

38:29.829 --> 38:31.396
To heal.

38:31.439 --> 38:34.181
- To begin again.
- But...

38:34.224 --> 38:36.270
that just-that
starts with my family,

38:36.314 --> 38:37.750
not with you.

38:37.793 --> 38:39.317
Yeah...

38:57.073 --> 38:59.685
Hey, um, so, uh, there's
this comet, and it only comes

38:59.728 --> 39:02.427
every 25 years.

39:02.470 --> 39:03.776
Will you watch it
with me tomorrow night?

39:03.819 --> 39:06.126
You always have your
head in the clouds

39:06.169 --> 39:07.910
or outer space.

39:07.954 --> 39:11.871
It's just, we're not
supposed to hang out.

39:11.914 --> 39:13.394
And I don't want my
parents any more pissed

39:13.438 --> 39:14.395
than they already are.

39:14.439 --> 39:15.614
They're fighting again?

39:15.657 --> 39:17.398
A lot.

39:17.442 --> 39:20.401
And I saw my dad go talk
to your mom today.

39:20.445 --> 39:22.142
Which is just
kind of messed-up,

39:22.185 --> 39:23.491
if you think about their past.

39:23.535 --> 39:25.493
They don't have to know
we're hanging out.

39:25.537 --> 39:27.539
I mean, we can watch
from your barn's hayloft.

39:27.582 --> 39:28.888
Only once every 25 years--

39:28.931 --> 39:30.542
I mean, I know you wouldn't
want to miss that.

39:32.239 --> 39:34.067
I like the way you see me.

39:34.110 --> 39:36.417
I guess I just believe in you.

39:37.723 --> 39:40.073
Well, I'll think about it. Okay?
