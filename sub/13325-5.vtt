WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:05.671
Sam, I am so sorry
we didn't believe you that
there was mold in the house.

00:05.673 --> 00:08.040
I can't believe you guys
let it go two weeks

00:08.042 --> 00:11.210
Do you know what
we've been breathing
and touching?

00:11.212 --> 00:13.746
Honey, we don't know
if this is bad mold.

00:13.748 --> 00:17.082
What if it's good mold?
Like penicillin.

00:17.084 --> 00:19.218
Right, your mom's
reluctance to scrub
anything

00:19.220 --> 00:21.120
Might be making us
much healthier.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.622
Seriously,
how dirty can
a shower get?

00:23.624 --> 00:26.158
It's just soap
and water in there.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.160
- ( coughing )
- let's-- let's just wait
to hear from the inspector

00:28.162 --> 00:31.296
Before we all overreact.

00:31.298 --> 00:33.665
All right, you've got
black mold everywhere.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.134
I'd get outta here today.

00:35.136 --> 00:37.503
Wait a second,
I lived here for
10 years.

00:37.505 --> 00:40.172
We never had a problem
with black mold.
Are you sure?

00:40.174 --> 00:42.274
I've been in
the mold game
for a long time.

00:42.276 --> 00:44.676
Trust me,
I know black mold
when I see--

00:44.678 --> 00:48.280
( coughing continues )

00:48.282 --> 00:51.216
- You okay?
- Yeah, just can't
shake this flu.

00:53.153 --> 00:55.654
Okay, sam. Let's go.
You've got clothes at my place.

00:55.656 --> 00:59.191
Hey, what about me?
We have no idea how long
this will take.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.827
My friend had mold,
she was out of her house
for a month.

01:01.829 --> 01:04.329
Well, then go stay with her.
It's already nice and clean.

01:04.331 --> 01:06.365
Look, jen.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.400
The last time
we lived together,
it didn't end well.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.135
There was--
there was--
there was

01:10.137 --> 01:12.271
Screaming, crying,
police, helicopters.

01:12.273 --> 01:15.274
It was like the end of
"e.T." except we wound up
with joint custody of the alien.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.077
So where am I
gonna go, charlie?

01:18.079 --> 01:20.312
- What about your new boyfriend?
- He's not my boyfriend.

01:20.314 --> 01:24.249
We've only dry-humped
in the parking lot behind
the olive garden...

01:24.251 --> 01:26.085
Twice.

01:26.087 --> 01:28.620
Also, he might
be married.

01:28.622 --> 01:31.323
Well, there's gotta be
somebody you can stay with.

01:31.325 --> 01:34.126
You probably need some space
to remember who that is.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.627
Shine on,
you hummingbird.

01:35.629 --> 01:38.163
I-I don't know
what that means.

01:38.165 --> 01:39.865
I think the mold
is getting to me.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.867
I'd get outta here quick
if I were you. Later.

01:46.172 --> 01:48.640
Okay, here we go.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.275
Are you a sociopath?

01:50.277 --> 01:52.277
I turned it into
a drinking game.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.880
I'll read the traits
and if you got it,
you drink.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.648
Awesome.
Go for it.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.317
Number one.

01:58.319 --> 02:01.753
Shows no apparent sense
of remorse, shame,
or guilt.

02:01.755 --> 02:04.356
Me, me, and me.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.658
How many questions
are there?

02:06.660 --> 02:10.329
- 20.
- I should probably
call you a cab now.

02:10.331 --> 02:12.364
Wait a minute.
Aren't you the guy
who just left his wife

02:12.366 --> 02:13.866
In a house full
of black mold?

02:13.868 --> 02:15.534
Bottoms up,
psycho.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.669
Hey, I am
not a psycho.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.338
Jen and I get along
great now.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.873
When we're living together,
it's a disaster.

02:20.875 --> 02:24.276
I'm doing this because
I care about her
so damn much.

02:24.278 --> 02:28.413
Unconvincing displays
of human emotions.

02:28.415 --> 02:31.250
Eh, you got me
on that one.

02:31.252 --> 02:34.553
Maybe we should
just check alcohol abuse,
thrill-seeking behavior,

02:34.555 --> 02:37.322
And get right to
sexually promiscuous.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.431
You taste like kentucky.

02:49.202 --> 02:51.270
<i>Jennifer:</i>
<i>Charlie, you here?</i>

02:56.476 --> 02:58.243
Charlie?

02:58.245 --> 03:01.547
I need to talk to you
about the house right now.

03:01.549 --> 03:04.850
- Hey, jen. What's up?
- Where'd you guys come from?

03:04.852 --> 03:08.187
We were right behind you.
We just left a seminar
on sociopaths.

03:08.189 --> 03:11.290
Did you know they lie
easily and without remorse?

03:11.292 --> 03:13.192
You know where
I slept last night?

03:13.194 --> 03:15.627
On a bunk bed in the kid's room
at my cousin bonnie's house.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.262
<i>You know who was</i>
<i>on the top bunk?</i>

03:17.264 --> 03:20.365
Her daughter louise,
fourth grade,
200 pounds--

03:20.367 --> 03:22.334
Not judging.
Still wets the bed.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.436
I basically slept
in a lean-to

03:24.438 --> 03:26.572
In a rain forest
and it's all your fault.

03:26.574 --> 03:28.340
How is it my fault?

03:28.342 --> 03:30.943
I'm the one who told
cousin bonnie not to
get pregnant at 50.

03:30.945 --> 03:33.312
No, when we got divorced,

03:33.314 --> 03:35.380
You gave me a house
with a mold problem.

03:35.382 --> 03:38.317
Last night, wide-awake,
wearing my poncho,

03:38.319 --> 03:41.286
I remembered
you wouldn't let me
get an inspection.

03:41.288 --> 03:43.889
I thought if there was mold,
the termites would eat it

03:43.891 --> 03:46.959
I didn't think
it was possible
to have both.

03:46.961 --> 03:50.329
Charlie, I wanna be near
my daughter and you owe me.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.297
If you don't wanna live
with me again, fine.

03:52.299 --> 03:56.335
I'll stay here,
you go sleep under
the 200-pound sea sponge.

03:56.337 --> 03:58.503
Again, not judging.

03:58.505 --> 04:01.506
Look, you can
stay here.

04:01.508 --> 04:05.310
I'm sorry,
I was incredibly selfish.

04:05.312 --> 04:07.479
I should've offered
in the first place, and just
because we're not married

04:07.481 --> 04:09.481
Doesn't mean
we're not family.

04:09.483 --> 04:12.417
God, thank you, charlie.
I feel the same way.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.853
I'll go get my stuff
out of my car.

04:16.522 --> 04:20.993
Wow, charlie,
as your therapist,
I am impressed.

04:20.995 --> 04:23.462
- You've come a long way.
- Yeah.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.330
I didn't mean
a word of it.

04:25.332 --> 04:27.833
Who's the sociopath now?

04:29.369 --> 04:31.436
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

04:34.474 --> 04:35.874
Okay, before we break.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.509
You might remember
when you all joined
the group

04:37.511 --> 04:39.344
That I asked
each of you to
write a letter

04:39.346 --> 04:42.714
I think now
would be a great time
to read them

04:42.716 --> 04:45.317
And see just how far
you've come.

04:45.319 --> 04:47.919
- Ed, would you like to start?
- Fine, but I gotta tell ya,

04:47.921 --> 04:51.356
I ain't gonna be getting
nothing out of this.

04:51.358 --> 04:53.992
"dear ed,
keep working this pencil

04:53.994 --> 04:56.895
So he thinks
you're doing something.

04:56.897 --> 05:00.299
This whole thing
is idiotic."

05:00.301 --> 05:01.900
Well, you're right.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.703
I don't recognize
this guy at all.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.738
Patrick, would you like
to read your letter?

05:06.740 --> 05:08.674
Would I?

05:08.676 --> 05:11.376
"charlie, I'm sorry
I won't be there

05:11.378 --> 05:13.378
When you read this
in your little therapy club,

05:13.380 --> 05:16.682
But if you watch tv
or follow the tabloids,

05:16.684 --> 05:20.652
You'll know that I have my own
hit reality show now,

05:20.654 --> 05:22.421
'personal shopper wars,'

05:22.423 --> 05:24.656
Hosted by me
and my close friend
anderson cooper."

05:24.658 --> 05:27.492
I can't read
any more of this.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.996
Anybody else in our
little "therapy club"
like to read their letter?

05:30.998 --> 05:35.400
- Lacey?
- "hey, hottie.

05:35.402 --> 05:38.337
The old guy
is creeping me out,

05:38.339 --> 05:40.339
I may have to punch
this gay dude in the throat,

05:40.341 --> 05:42.441
And I'm pretty sure

05:42.443 --> 05:45.944
Shaggy next to me
is special needs."

05:45.946 --> 05:48.580
And look, now you know
all their names.

05:48.582 --> 05:51.516
Progress.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.452
"hey, future nolan.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.354
I just wanna let you know
that I'm proud of you

05:55.356 --> 05:57.656
And if you've had
any progress,

05:57.658 --> 05:59.691
You're a success.

05:59.693 --> 06:03.428
And you should feel great
about yourself 'cause
you're awesome."

06:03.430 --> 06:05.430
Nolan, can I see
your letter?

06:07.767 --> 06:10.502
It's a picture
of a cat driving
a race car.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.808
Okay.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.577
Let's see what
I wrote.

06:20.079 --> 06:22.147
"look how hard
they're working
on their letters.

06:22.149 --> 06:25.050
Obviously, they respect
the process and are dedicated

06:25.052 --> 06:26.618
To getting
better quickly

06:26.620 --> 06:28.387
Rather than
meandering along

06:28.389 --> 06:31.556
Week after week
after week."

06:31.558 --> 06:33.625
Okay, I'll see you all
next week.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.467
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:42.469 --> 06:45.737
Patrick, did they talk about
your sweater in group today?

06:45.739 --> 06:49.474
- It's a real cry for help.
- Thanks, sam.

06:49.476 --> 06:51.943
I'm so glad that you
finally took my advice

06:51.945 --> 06:54.179
And suffocated
your wardrobe.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.448
Ha! I win.

06:58.751 --> 07:02.421
- How did you do this?
- I saw jen set up her
chuck norris home gym

07:02.423 --> 07:04.756
In the garage and thought
I'd sneak in a few reps

07:04.758 --> 07:08.126
And I pinched my finger
trying to adjust the seat.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.562
If you need a band-aid
for a pinch,

07:10.564 --> 07:13.532
Chuck norris doesn't
want you using his gym.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.834
So how weird is it

07:15.836 --> 07:17.736
Having the ex
living here?

07:17.738 --> 07:20.138
Well, I can't park
in my garage,

07:20.140 --> 07:23.108
The house is full of flies
'cause she won't close a door,

07:23.110 --> 07:25.610
And we've restarted
the thermostat wars
of 1998.

07:25.612 --> 07:28.079
How's that go down
with your girl kate?

07:28.081 --> 07:30.182
- Any jealousy?
- No, no.

07:30.184 --> 07:33.552
- She's cool with it
and it's making me nuts.
- Let me ask you something.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.821
During sex, does she make
a lot of noises?

07:35.823 --> 07:38.156
I-- I guess so.
What does that tell you?

07:38.158 --> 07:40.058
Nothing.
I just wanna know stuff.

07:42.962 --> 07:46.665
It's so cold in here.
How did these flies
even survive?

07:46.667 --> 07:49.868
I don't know.
It's like someone
keeps letting in new ones.

07:49.870 --> 07:53.738
I gotta jet.
I'm out.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.807
Stop by anytime,
michael.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.243
Apparently, our door
is always open.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.748
Hey, hey, hey.
This isn't like one
of those magic sinks

08:03.750 --> 08:05.617
At the airport
that turns itself off.

08:05.619 --> 08:08.553
I know. I got more fruit
to wash in a minute.

08:08.555 --> 08:11.823
You're right. I'm gonna start
the oven in case I wanna make
a turkey at thanksgiving.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.493
Here we go.
Just like old times.

08:14.495 --> 08:16.761
I'll tell you what.
I won't touch anything
in your kitchen.

08:16.763 --> 08:19.564
We'll just call
your housekeeper
and have her do everything.

08:19.566 --> 08:22.534
- I don't have a housekeeper.
- What?

08:22.536 --> 08:24.603
You're kidding.
This place is immaculate.

08:24.605 --> 08:28.073
Well, anything
that's not covered in mold
would seem clean to you.

08:28.075 --> 08:31.543
- But thank you.
- Since when did you
get so domestic?

08:31.545 --> 08:34.246
You didn't do
any of this stuff
when we were married.

08:34.248 --> 08:36.848
Yeah, well, there were
a lot of things you didn't do
when we were married, too.

08:36.850 --> 08:40.252
Yeah, well,
I'm doing 'em now
and I'm good at 'em.

08:40.254 --> 08:43.855
If you were really good
at 'em, you'd have
a place to stay.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.857
Well, I do have
a place to stay

08:45.859 --> 08:48.126
And I don't have
to do nothing, sucka.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.000
- How does chinese sound?
- Good.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.269
I'm gonna get some mongolian
beef. You want anything?

08:57.271 --> 09:00.605
- Sure, I'll have---
- lemon chicken-- take the skin
off before you cook it,

09:00.607 --> 09:03.008
- Spring rolls,
and white rice.
- Wow, impressive.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.710
- ( phone ringing )
- after 18 years of sending
your chinese food back,

09:05.712 --> 09:07.779
I think I finally
got it right.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.984
- Hi, kate.
- Hi, just wanted to see

09:12.986 --> 09:14.953
If you could come over early
for our playdate tonight.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.922
Oh, man.

09:16.924 --> 09:19.958
I just made plans
with jen to have chinese,
but I'll stop by later on.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.994
You and jen
are having chinese?

09:22.996 --> 09:25.964
- You're not fighting?
- No, no, it's fine.

09:25.966 --> 09:28.133
Oh, she's there.

09:28.135 --> 09:29.935
- You can't talk.
- No, I can talk.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.603
It's-- it's fine.

09:31.605 --> 09:36.074
So it's not awkward having
her there? No control issues?

09:36.076 --> 09:38.610
Nope. All good.
I'll see ya later.

09:38.612 --> 09:41.646
Oh, by the way,

09:41.648 --> 09:43.248
Did you want me
to wear that

09:43.250 --> 09:46.685
Latex bodysuit or
the little schoolgirl outfit?

09:52.725 --> 09:54.659
The second one.

09:54.661 --> 09:57.762
Say it or you get
nothing tonight.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.665
- Oh, come on. Really?
- Scared?

10:00.667 --> 10:03.802
- Not at all.
- You don't have the balls
to say it.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.638
The little
schoolgirl outfit.

10:08.741 --> 10:10.241
And that outfit

10:10.243 --> 10:13.078
Is a proud organization
called the girl scouts
of america.

10:14.281 --> 10:18.717
So I'm not gonna sit here
and listen to you demean them.

10:18.719 --> 10:21.119
I'll drop by later on
and pick up my box
of thin mints.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.864
Oh, crap.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.633
Charlie, wake up.

10:34.635 --> 10:36.635
We fell asleep.

10:36.637 --> 10:39.771
Did we fall asleep
watching hillbilly
handfishin'?

10:39.773 --> 10:41.940
Yes, we did.

10:41.942 --> 10:44.809
You know, I'd written
hillbillies off as a bunch
of ignorant hicks,

10:44.811 --> 10:47.712
But after--
how many episodes
did we watch?

10:47.714 --> 10:50.382
Six.

10:50.384 --> 10:53.752
They're real human beings
with real stories

10:53.754 --> 10:55.787
That just happen
to revolve around

10:55.789 --> 10:57.856
Catching catfish
with your hands.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.894
Oh, crap.
It's nine in the morning.

11:02.896 --> 11:05.697
- I forgot all about kate.
- Well, I'm sure she'll
understand.

11:05.699 --> 11:08.767
It was just
girl scout cookies.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.869
But do me a favor,
don't tell her that
you had some wine

11:10.871 --> 11:12.971
And fell asleep
with your ex-wife

11:12.973 --> 11:15.774
After some
hillbilly hand fishing.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.776
It just sounds so dirty.

11:21.147 --> 11:23.915
Kate, I am so sorry
about last night.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.884
It's okay.
I got your message.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.886
So food poisoning, huh?

11:27.888 --> 11:30.188
Yeah, yeah, believe me,
you do not want to spend
an entire night

11:30.190 --> 11:32.123
With a bad catfish.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.759
Catfish?
I thought
you had chinese.

11:34.761 --> 11:37.829
I did and then
we ordered catfish.

11:37.831 --> 11:40.965
Never mix asian and cajun.

11:40.967 --> 11:43.935
Unless you want your kid
to be a concert washboardist.

11:48.841 --> 11:51.743
Well, I'm glad
you're okay.

11:51.745 --> 11:54.479
So let's talk about jen.
Is the house feeling crowded?

11:54.481 --> 11:56.748
What's the dynamic?
Where does she sleep?

11:56.750 --> 11:59.884
No, good,
and in the guest room.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.886
Oh, I'm surprised.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.788
I mean, you guys
were together so long,

12:03.790 --> 12:05.824
You could just probably

12:05.826 --> 12:08.059
Sleep in
the same bed together.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.161
Why, I think that would
be a little strange.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.797
Some men like
a little strange.

12:12.799 --> 12:16.267
Especially a little strange
that's familiar.

12:16.269 --> 12:19.404
- Are you okay?
- Hey, you're the patient,
I'm the doctor.

12:19.406 --> 12:22.373
I'll ask the questions here.
So, did you bang her?

12:22.375 --> 12:24.476
No, no.

12:24.478 --> 12:27.412
We just fell
asleep after a little
hillbilly hand fishing.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.081
That's disgusting.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.817
It's not what you think.
It's a tv show.

12:32.819 --> 12:36.254
I know.
It's disgusting.

12:40.093 --> 12:44.429
Last week, wayne was having
some trouble empathizing
with his victims.

12:44.431 --> 12:47.932
So I asked him to write a play
about his crime

12:47.934 --> 12:49.100
To help him better understand

12:49.102 --> 12:50.401
The pain
of the people he wronged.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.270
Thank you.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.139
Cleo will play my wife.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.941
Ernesto will play
her lover.

12:56.943 --> 13:00.478
I call this play
"the boy who couldn't cry."

13:00.480 --> 13:02.113
Well, that's very
insightful, wayne.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.182
Oh, it's not me.
It's the kid next door.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.217
He's got his mouth
duct-taped.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.853
Spoiler alert.

13:08.855 --> 13:10.855
Charlie, you'll play
the narrator.

13:10.857 --> 13:13.024
Old uncle stan.
You start.

13:15.995 --> 13:18.930
Oh, I didn't see
you there.

13:18.932 --> 13:21.499
Welcome to "pussytown."

13:21.501 --> 13:23.334
Oh, it's a real place.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.837
Full of crybabies
and pussies.

13:25.839 --> 13:29.307
I guess you're all curious
about our most famous citizen.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.577
Wayne dwayne earl.

13:32.579 --> 13:35.880
Wait, I think I hear
his pickup pulling up
to his house now.

13:35.882 --> 13:37.882
I sure hope his wife
isn't having sex

13:37.884 --> 13:39.951
With his neighbor
and best friend

13:39.953 --> 13:42.587
And that wayne
doesn't come in
and shoot them both.

13:45.958 --> 13:48.493
Oh, wayne,
you're home!

13:48.495 --> 13:50.862
It's not what
it looks like!

13:50.864 --> 13:53.598
<i>Dios mio.</i>

13:53.600 --> 13:55.967
- ( mimics gunshot )
- ow!

13:55.969 --> 13:57.936
- We had this coming.
- ( mimics gunshot )

13:57.938 --> 14:01.172
Ah! I've been
a bad friend.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.075
- ( mimicking gunshots )
- ow!

14:04.077 --> 14:06.845
<i>Ow! Ow! Ow!</i>

14:06.847 --> 14:09.414
- Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
- Okay, okay.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.015
Okay, wayne.
Okay, okay.
We get it.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.984
We get it,
we get it,
we get it.

14:12.986 --> 14:17.589
The point was to demonstrate
that you learned something about
your victims' feelings.

14:17.591 --> 14:20.124
Well, that's what
the "ows" were for.

14:20.126 --> 14:22.861
The bullets hurt them.

14:22.863 --> 14:26.331
Okay, okay.
Let's just talk about
what was supposed to happen.

14:26.333 --> 14:29.534
The point of this was
to be able to put yourself
in your victims' shoes.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.870
I think charlie's
trying to get us
to think about

14:31.872 --> 14:33.872
How other people feel
before we get all mad

14:33.874 --> 14:36.007
And jealous
and kill them.

14:36.009 --> 14:40.044
Now, we all have anger issues,
and jealousy is a trigger,

14:40.046 --> 14:42.513
So it's important that
we avoid extremely
jealous partners.

14:42.515 --> 14:46.417
- That leaves out women.
- Well, that's a generalization.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.953
Some women get jealous,
some women don't.

14:48.955 --> 14:52.523
And then some do
and then won't admit it.

14:52.525 --> 14:55.093
Oh, I call shenanigans.

14:56.161 --> 14:58.897
You're talking about yourself.

14:58.899 --> 15:02.634
Okay, well,
since you called
shenanigans.

15:02.636 --> 15:05.436
Yes, yes, I am talking
about a woman I'm seeing.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.205
Why won't she admit
she's jealous?

15:07.207 --> 15:09.274
Because she doesn't want
a real relationship.

15:09.276 --> 15:12.010
If she admits that
she's jealous, that means
she has real feelings for me.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.912
Gotta force her hand, dude.

15:13.914 --> 15:15.413
Do something with another girl

15:15.415 --> 15:17.916
And make sure
the robot lady finds out.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.684
( chuckles )
robot lady.

15:19.686 --> 15:22.053
That's pretty good.

15:22.055 --> 15:24.956
Well, thanks for the advice,
guys. I'll think about it.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.659
Don't think, just do it.

15:27.661 --> 15:31.062
Like the time I stabbed a guy
for a pair of sneakers.

15:31.064 --> 15:33.064
Ernesto, in retrospect,

15:33.066 --> 15:35.600
Don't you wish you'd thought
about that first?

15:35.602 --> 15:37.335
In retrospect,

15:37.337 --> 15:40.305
I wish I had checked
the dude's shoe size first.

15:41.507 --> 15:43.574
What a senseless crime.

15:49.248 --> 15:51.482
Somebody's getting
laid tonight.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.952
Hey, I'm just having
a nice dinner with my ex.

15:53.954 --> 15:57.088
I'm not even talking
about you. I've been
meeting guys on jdate.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.190
Oh, dating
jewish guys now, huh?

15:59.192 --> 16:02.060
Is that what
the "j" stands for?

16:02.062 --> 16:03.728
What did you think
it stood for?

16:03.730 --> 16:07.365
I didn't care.

16:07.367 --> 16:11.002
- Waiting on a call?
- No, I thought kate
would text me.

16:11.004 --> 16:14.272
We were supposed to go out
tonight, but I-- I bailed
at the last minute.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.507
I wanted her to know
I was going out with jen.

16:16.509 --> 16:21.279
Last week the same thing
happened to me with shlomo
and menachem.

16:21.281 --> 16:24.549
And it-- it never
crossed your mind

16:24.551 --> 16:26.117
That the "j" stood
for jewish?

16:26.119 --> 16:28.586
I know, I feel
like such a schmuck.

16:34.026 --> 16:35.526
- Thank you.
- Sure.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.428
Cheers.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.097
This is nice.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.099
I didn't think we'd be
doing this kind of stuff

16:41.101 --> 16:44.002
When I bullied you
into letting me stay
at your house.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.270
Well, I am a sucker
for a sexy bully.

16:46.272 --> 16:49.640
I'm sorry.
Where'd that
come from?

16:49.642 --> 16:51.376
It's all right,
you can call me sexy.

16:51.378 --> 16:54.278
I know I got it going on.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.214
It's a good thing
we're not married anymore.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.182
We'd screw this up.

16:58.184 --> 17:01.119
I don't know.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.187
We're different now.

17:05.090 --> 17:08.760
Wow, look who's here.

17:08.762 --> 17:10.294
- Kate.
- Hi.

17:10.296 --> 17:13.631
- What are you doing here?
- I'm stalking you.

17:16.402 --> 17:18.569
So how's the food?

17:18.571 --> 17:21.072
I'm thinking about
buying the place.

17:21.074 --> 17:23.274
I didn't know
you were thinking about
buying a restaurant.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.410
I'm not.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.311
- I'll tell you
why I'm really here.
- No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:27.313 --> 17:30.048
Before you do that,
you know what can be
really fun?

17:30.050 --> 17:31.516
Let's go to the bathroom
and throw up a little bit.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.785
I'm fine.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.723
See how kind
and giving he is?

17:38.725 --> 17:43.061
Has he given
anything to
you lately?

17:43.063 --> 17:45.463
Who wants pie?
I want pie.

17:47.132 --> 17:50.601
How much pie do you need?
I think you've had
enough pie.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.336
I think you're in
no condition

17:52.338 --> 17:54.439
To operate a metaphor.

17:54.441 --> 17:57.141
Kate, why are you
really here?

17:57.143 --> 17:59.077
- Okay, you got me.
- Okay.

18:00.179 --> 18:02.480
Back to one, everybody.
Full reverse.

18:02.482 --> 18:06.617
I'm really here
because I got stood up.

18:06.619 --> 18:09.787
- Oh, god.
- ♪ dun, dun, dun.

18:09.789 --> 18:12.323
That sucks!

18:12.325 --> 18:14.592
You know, I don't wanna offend
you because I'm not
that familiar

18:14.594 --> 18:16.494
With the lesbian community,

18:16.496 --> 18:18.729
But sounds like this bitch
needs her ass kicked.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.498
Oh, I wish you would.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.568
The girl I'm seeing
is such a girl.

18:23.570 --> 18:27.238
Oh, we were just
supposed to be having
simple sex,

18:27.240 --> 18:30.441
But she has feelings

18:30.443 --> 18:33.478
And she wants me
to have feelings.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.746
And I'm supposed to be
a bad person

18:35.748 --> 18:38.850
Because I don't
have feelings.

18:38.852 --> 18:40.885
Which I don't.

18:40.887 --> 18:43.654
- It's exhausting.
- ( screams )

18:44.623 --> 18:46.891
Okay, now it's a party!

18:46.893 --> 18:49.760
Hey, charlie,
maybe you should
drive kate home.

18:49.762 --> 18:52.663
I don't know.
It's like having
an open bottle in the car.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.367
Okay, come on, kate.
Come on, let's go.

18:58.537 --> 19:00.805
- Oh, you know what?
- Jennifer: <i>What?</i>

19:00.807 --> 19:03.508
I changed my mind.
I don't wanna buy
this place.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.376
The floor moves.

19:08.547 --> 19:11.482
- This is so embarrassing.
- Don't worry about it.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.750
I don't think
anybody noticed.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.652
Lots of women squat down
on the sidewalk

19:14.654 --> 19:17.688
For a few moments,
then walk away.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.857
I don't care about that.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.592
I got jealous.

19:21.594 --> 19:24.595
I can't believe
I was like some
stupid high school chick.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.831
"oh, he's with another girl,

19:26.833 --> 19:28.933
I'm gonna go key his car."

19:28.935 --> 19:31.736
Oh, yeah. You're gonna
have to repaint your car.

19:33.639 --> 19:35.706
Look, it's okay.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.608
I think it's nice
that you care about me,

19:37.610 --> 19:38.943
Even though
you haven't actually said it.

19:38.945 --> 19:42.847
What, you need two women
to say it to you?

19:42.849 --> 19:46.584
- What?
- I saw the way
she was looking at you.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.486
Come on.
How was she looking at me?

19:48.488 --> 19:50.555
Like this.

19:54.259 --> 19:56.327
Did her eyes roll around
in her head like that?

19:57.896 --> 20:00.598
Okay, since you're
being honest.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.800
<i>Tonight was a setup.</i>

20:02.802 --> 20:06.437
I told you about my date
with jen to make you jealous.

20:06.439 --> 20:07.772
Oh, yeah?

20:07.774 --> 20:10.474
Well, I only said
I was jealous

20:10.476 --> 20:13.444
To get you to admit
you tricked me.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.713
- I take it back.
- ( sighs )

20:15.715 --> 20:17.715
All right, you win.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.818
- You were jealous.
- That's better.

20:24.923 --> 20:27.758
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

20:27.760 --> 20:31.295
- What's up?
- Oh, while you were gone,
I texted that guy I was seeing

20:31.297 --> 20:32.863
And he invited me
to come stay with him.

20:32.865 --> 20:36.567
- Oh.
- Good news, right?

20:36.569 --> 20:38.903
Sure.
Whatever you wanna do.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.705
- So he's not married?
- Nope.

20:40.707 --> 20:43.708
Wears a wedding ring
to keep the crazies away.

20:43.710 --> 20:46.644
- Didn't work this time.
- ( giggles )

20:46.646 --> 20:48.012
Yeah.

20:48.014 --> 20:50.881
Yeah.

20:50.883 --> 20:54.652
Listen, I really appreciate
you letting me stay here.

20:54.654 --> 20:57.755
It was fun to spend time
with you again.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.757
Okay.

21:03.862 --> 21:06.264
Look, anything you need...
