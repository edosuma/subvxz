00:51.040 --> 00:53.460
My boy said you could hook me up.

00:53.560 --> 00:55.380
I don't know you.

00:55.480 --> 00:57.562
Come on, bro, I could use
an ounce if you got it.

00:57.680 --> 00:59.300
I don't know
what you're talking about, man.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.620
How about... no the ocean would be nice,

01:01.720 --> 01:03.820
but let's give
the first room a shot. Come on.

01:03.920 --> 01:07.380
Hey, how long you been dyeing your hair?

01:07.480 --> 01:09.860
- Come on.
- Put your arm around her.

01:09.960 --> 01:13.760
Come on, smile Hester, with teeth.

01:13.920 --> 01:15.180
What you doing Saturday?

01:15.280 --> 01:18.250
- Now grab her tit.
- Knock it off.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.180
Shit!

01:21.280 --> 01:24.363
- Damn it!
- Relax, Dane can handle himself.

01:30.080 --> 01:33.084
- Who are these two punks?
- Let's go.

01:40.120 --> 01:41.884
I don't want a 50, I need an ounce.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.923
That's too much, I don't carry that.

01:44.120 --> 01:45.167
What's wrong with you?

01:45.280 --> 01:47.965
- I'm strung out.
- Strung out?

01:48.120 --> 01:49.460
You playing with me?

01:49.560 --> 01:51.927
- 'Cause you smell like a cop.
- Nah, man.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.690
Police, don't move!

01:55.120 --> 01:56.500
Drop the gun, asshole!

01:56.600 --> 01:58.460
- Stop moving, you hear me?
- Get off of me!

01:58.560 --> 01:59.641
- You alright?
- Get off me!

01:59.760 --> 02:00.841
- Yeah.
- Grab his gun!

02:00.960 --> 02:02.300
Got it.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.402
Okay, hey, listen up
buddy, here's the deal,

02:04.520 --> 02:08.180
when a police officer tells you
to stop moving, you stop moving!

02:08.280 --> 02:10.539
- Oh, shit, county police!
- Get down on the ground!

02:10.639 --> 02:12.369
On the ground now!

02:13.440 --> 02:15.124
Put your hands behind your head.

02:15.280 --> 02:16.930
- Dane?
- Yeah?

02:17.040 --> 02:18.380
Hands behind your head!

02:18.480 --> 02:22.963
Oh, boy.

02:24.720 --> 02:27.007
Yeah, shut up. Let's go.

02:45.880 --> 02:47.220
You're cut off, buddy.

02:47.320 --> 02:49.004
Cheers, partner, good work.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.161
Cheers, Dane.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.580
Looks like every politician
in the county's here tonight.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.580
They like cops when we make headlines.

02:56.680 --> 02:58.011
Yeah.

02:58.160 --> 02:59.685
Fan of yours?

03:01.000 --> 03:03.460
She's just after me
for a ride on my Harley.

03:03.560 --> 03:05.580
Is there any female in the Ocean County PD

03:05.680 --> 03:07.340
who hasn't gotten to ride on your Harley?

03:07.440 --> 03:08.487
Just one.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.201
Hey, Dane.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.931
- Good work.
- Thanks, chief.

03:14.040 --> 03:17.010
You met Bryan Kelder?
He was just elected freeholder.

03:17.120 --> 03:18.884
- Ah, congratulations.
- Thank you.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.004
The board of freeholders
is proud of our excellent police force.

03:22.120 --> 03:25.580
Well this is my excellent
partner, Laurel Hester.

03:25.680 --> 03:27.980
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

03:28.080 --> 03:29.889
My daughter here wants to be a detective.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.322
Good for you, it's a good job,
but it's not what you see on TV.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.044
I know.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.806
- It was good to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.980
That low-life you busted,

03:41.080 --> 03:44.300
you think he might give us a lead
on a double homicide in Brick?

03:44.400 --> 03:47.500
It's possible, he certainly
ran his share of coke through Brick.

03:47.600 --> 03:48.806
Why don't you give us a crack at it?

03:48.920 --> 03:51.810
- We'll tail him.
- It's your case.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.928
To Ocean County's finest!

04:04.960 --> 04:06.086
Get it, Stace, come on.

04:06.240 --> 04:09.130
Come on, Stace!

04:09.240 --> 04:11.740
- Nice serve.
- Oh, oh, whoa.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.683
That's what I'm talking about!

04:16.120 --> 04:17.459
You almost had it, it's okay.

04:17.560 --> 04:19.130
It's okay at least you're trying.

04:19.240 --> 04:20.969
- I haven't played since high school.
- I know.

04:21.079 --> 04:23.620
Alright, chin up, alright come on.
Round two!

04:23.720 --> 04:25.180
Let's go right here.

04:25.280 --> 04:27.420
Who's the um, the new
girls, the one with the hair.

04:27.520 --> 04:29.300
She can't play for shit.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.880
That's your hole, okay?
Make her eat it, make her eat it.

04:47.080 --> 04:48.969
Go, go, go, go, good!

04:49.640 --> 04:51.005
Shoot!

04:54.160 --> 04:57.289
Whoa, what kind of
bullshit serve was that?

05:01.160 --> 05:03.540
Point time, ladies, point time.

05:03.640 --> 05:05.927
We suck this year.

05:09.480 --> 05:11.860
Well, there goes the princess.

05:11.960 --> 05:15.220
- Hey, it's now or never.
- Shut up. Shut up.

05:15.320 --> 05:17.448
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.164
Hey, you leaving?

05:20.320 --> 05:23.802
Oh, yeah, all kinds of work to do,
it's a long drive home.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.740
- Where's that?
- Ocean County, New Jersey.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.900
Damn.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.480
You drove all the way out here to play
volleyball and you don't even like it?

05:31.600 --> 05:35.900
Every now and then I
think you should go out and...

05:36.000 --> 05:38.810
- Try and meet someone?
- Yeah.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.540
They don't have girls in Jersey?

05:42.640 --> 05:44.369
It's not that.

05:47.240 --> 05:50.210
People know me back home,
it's hard to go out and have privacy.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.364
I should go.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.006
Okay.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.042
Can I have your number?

06:14.200 --> 06:19.240
- I don't have any paper.
- Just write it on my arm.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.050
I'm Stacie.

06:23.240 --> 06:24.810
I'll give you my cell.

06:26.160 --> 06:29.660
If I'm working, probably won't answer.

06:29.760 --> 06:32.969
And if anyone asks where we met,

06:33.080 --> 06:35.082
please don't mention it.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.500
Laurel.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.540
You have a lot of rules, Laurel.

06:42.640 --> 06:44.483
Yeah, I've been told that.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.607
- What, what, what?
- Hey!

06:58.000 --> 07:00.660
This still get you going?
Spying on junkies?

07:00.760 --> 07:01.740
Huh?

07:01.840 --> 07:03.763
Come on, he's never gonna
lead us to the shooters.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.809
Maybe his girl will.

07:13.640 --> 07:14.801
Hello?

07:17.040 --> 07:19.940
It's Stacie from volleyball.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.580
Listen, I can't talk right now.

07:21.680 --> 07:24.020
Go right ahead, we're not
doing anything important.

07:24.120 --> 07:26.620
Just your run of the mill
double homicide investigation.

07:26.720 --> 07:28.290
Shut up, I can't hear.

07:28.440 --> 07:31.728
Maybe I should get out of
the car, give you some privacy.

07:32.680 --> 07:33.920
When?

07:35.440 --> 07:38.250
Can I call you later?

07:39.760 --> 07:41.569
Okay, bye.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.291
You got a date?

07:45.120 --> 07:47.540
Yeah, I do.

07:47.640 --> 07:50.484
Something serious?

07:50.600 --> 07:54.047
I'll let you know, I'll call you after.

08:12.600 --> 08:16.780
- Here's a soda and a straw...
- Thanks.

08:16.880 --> 08:19.167
- Let me pay you for that.
- Oh, no.

08:19.280 --> 08:21.203
Thank you.

08:23.160 --> 08:26.164
- You look great.
- You look great.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.924
You know, I'm
significantly older than you.

08:31.520 --> 08:33.807
Yeah?

08:34.720 --> 08:35.820
Do you dance?

08:35.919 --> 08:38.400
Not to this, I hate country music.

08:40.039 --> 08:42.100
- I guess this was a...
- No.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.884
- A Bad idea.
- No, sorry.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.580
That came out wrong, I, you know,

08:46.680 --> 08:50.460
I don't date much so I don't know
how to be smooth or whatever.

08:50.560 --> 08:53.740
You don't, you don't
have to be smooth with me.

08:53.840 --> 08:56.241
But if you're really sorry,

08:56.360 --> 08:57.780
and you want to make it up to me...

08:57.880 --> 09:00.020
Oh, come on.
No, I'll make a fool of myself.

09:00.120 --> 09:03.300
No, you won't, trust me, trust me.

09:03.400 --> 09:07.041
Take my hand, put your
other hand on my shoulder.

09:13.240 --> 09:16.130
Shuffle, step, step.

09:16.240 --> 09:21.280
Shuffle, shuffle, step, step.

09:23.080 --> 09:25.287
I don't like going backwards.

09:25.400 --> 09:26.731
I'll guide you.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.740
You hate giving up control, don't you?

09:36.840 --> 09:38.285
Yeah, I hate it.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.607
We'll have to work on that.

10:07.040 --> 10:10.220
I need a break. You want a beer?

10:10.320 --> 10:12.926
- I'll get you beer.
- Sure, yeah.

10:47.840 --> 10:51.580
Hey! What's the matter?

10:51.680 --> 10:54.490
Oh, it was just hot in there,
I wanted to get some air.

10:54.640 --> 10:58.531
That was weird. What are you,
are you trying to ditch me?

10:58.640 --> 11:00.688
No. Of course not, no.

11:01.840 --> 11:04.844
Want to go look at the water?

11:06.160 --> 11:08.260
Sure.

11:08.360 --> 11:14.163
I always... I always feel better if
I can look at the water, day or night.

11:15.680 --> 11:19.900
That's why I live at the
ocean, just to be near it.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.686
- Oh, does this bother you?
- No.

11:24.520 --> 11:26.100
You want a drink.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.260
- Oh, no thanks.
- You don't drink?

11:28.360 --> 11:31.660
Not much, my mother was an alcoholic.

11:31.760 --> 11:35.460
- Was?
- She passed away.

11:35.560 --> 11:38.484
- I really miss her.
- Sorry.

11:39.760 --> 11:43.560
My... my father just died.

11:43.720 --> 11:46.180
I'm sorry about that.

11:46.280 --> 11:47.820
He was cool.

11:47.920 --> 11:53.700
He... taught me how
to take apart an engine,

11:53.800 --> 11:58.966
it was so nice just working, being...

12:03.880 --> 12:05.609
Why'd you stop?

12:05.720 --> 12:09.361
- Suddenly felt stupid.
- You're not stupid. Not at all.

12:11.200 --> 12:15.220
I just meant, that's what
it's supposed to feel like,

12:15.320 --> 12:17.846
you know, with another person.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.887
Trusting that person.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.447
- So hard.
- Yeah.

12:26.560 --> 12:32.060
Sorry, I get a few beers in
me I sound pretty ridiculous.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.322
I don't think so.

12:49.080 --> 12:54.849
- Hey, what's going on here?
- Yeah, we love us some dykes.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.769
We don't want any trouble, so.

12:56.880 --> 12:58.260
Who gives a fuck what you want?

12:58.360 --> 12:59.340
I want your money.

12:59.440 --> 13:00.601
Hey, get out of here!

13:00.800 --> 13:02.643
- Take it easy.
- Get out!

13:02.800 --> 13:05.485
- Take it easy.
- Go, get out, get out!

13:05.600 --> 13:07.807
Take it easy!

13:10.240 --> 13:12.060
You okay?

13:12.160 --> 13:14.288
- What's going on?
- I'm a police officer.

13:14.400 --> 13:17.020
- You're a cop?
- Detective. I should've told you.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.060
- You always carry a gun?
- Most the time.

13:19.160 --> 13:20.924
On a date!

13:25.440 --> 13:27.522
Sorry.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.009
Sorry.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.806
I think you should come home with me.

15:04.480 --> 15:06.220
Martha Stewart has a new worry,

15:06.320 --> 15:08.180
an assistant to her stock
broker has pleaded guilty

15:08.280 --> 15:12.763
to a charge of keeping quiet
about alleged insider trading...

15:43.520 --> 15:45.727
Laurel...

15:45.840 --> 15:48.140
Laurel, your phone's
ringing, do you want me to,

15:48.240 --> 15:49.446
do you want me to get it?

15:50.240 --> 15:51.241
Hey!

15:52.800 --> 15:54.180
Hester.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.900
Oh, hi, Lindy, I thought
you were the office.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.604
Can I call you back?

15:59.400 --> 16:00.540
Okay.

16:00.640 --> 16:03.180
Never answer my phone, okay?

16:03.280 --> 16:05.580
That could've been my partner or my boss.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.940
Sorry I yelled at you, but it's important.

16:08.040 --> 16:11.362
And I'm over it.

16:11.640 --> 16:14.700
Do you want some coffee or some toast?

16:14.800 --> 16:17.340
What, you're a cop so you
think you can yell at people?

16:17.440 --> 16:19.260
- Is that...
- I have to be careful.

16:19.360 --> 16:23.060
In law enforcement women
don't get important cases,

16:23.160 --> 16:25.100
they don't get promoted.
A gay woman, forget it.

16:25.200 --> 16:28.245
Yeah, well, I have to drive all the way
to Pennsylvania, it's like an hour.

16:29.240 --> 16:31.020
I'm going home.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.485
Okay.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.725
Okay?

16:34.840 --> 16:37.241
That's what you're gonna say, okay?

16:39.320 --> 16:42.529
Got a lot of work to get
through this afternoon, so.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.290
Shit...

17:23.359 --> 17:24.724
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:24.839 --> 17:26.540
Remember how you said that
none of Jeeter's buddies

17:26.640 --> 17:28.140
would help us with that double homicide?

17:28.240 --> 17:29.924
- Yeah.
- Look.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.884
Christie Miller, Jeeter's girl.

17:33.040 --> 17:35.380
- So?
- Same high school as Debbie Cherico.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.562
Signed the year book,
"Best friends forever."

17:38.320 --> 17:39.765
Nice.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.420
Let's find her and bring her in.

17:41.520 --> 17:44.140
She works at that
coffee shop in Beachwood.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.766
- You have been working hard.
- All night long.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.660
I'll make a call.

17:48.760 --> 17:52.731
- I guess I owe you $10.
- No, I think it's 20.

17:58.120 --> 18:02.020
- Hey.
- What's up Belkin?

18:02.120 --> 18:04.407
Hey, Belkin, I want those... on my desk.

18:04.520 --> 18:08.809
You were at the club
Saturday night, right?

18:11.280 --> 18:16.605
Okay, but, uh, we're good right?

18:16.720 --> 18:19.300
I mean I just made detective
I can't risk anybody...

18:19.400 --> 18:22.688
We're good, Belkin.
You don't have to worry.

18:23.360 --> 18:24.600
Okay.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.164
Hey.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.483
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:56.120 --> 18:57.340
I screwed up.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.540
I had no right to talk
to you the way I did.

18:59.640 --> 19:03.201
I ruined our date and I really
enjoy being with you and...

19:04.400 --> 19:06.243
I'm nervous...

19:07.320 --> 19:09.049
Maybe I am too old for you.

19:09.160 --> 19:10.700
Will you stop saying that?

19:10.800 --> 19:13.770
If anything you're too smart for me.

19:13.880 --> 19:17.100
No way, you're smart,
funny, and you're honest

19:17.200 --> 19:21.762
and... basically, I think you're amazing.

19:26.560 --> 19:27.891
You there?

19:28.000 --> 19:31.561
So you called to say I'm amazing?

19:32.640 --> 19:34.210
Yes.

19:35.280 --> 19:37.009
Can I see you again?

19:38.800 --> 19:40.580
Yeah.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.580
Yeah, you can.

19:42.680 --> 19:45.206
Great. Great.

20:29.640 --> 20:31.780
If you could have anything,
what would it be?

20:31.880 --> 20:33.120
What's your dream?

20:34.440 --> 20:36.090
What do you mean, like, be rich or famous?

20:36.240 --> 20:39.528
No, I mean, your big dream,
dream for your life.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.244
- My big dream's kind of small.
- Oh, yeah?

20:46.480 --> 20:50.371
A woman I love loves me.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.980
A house, a dog.

20:54.080 --> 21:00.087
Mm, me too. House, yard, dog, partner.

21:00.920 --> 21:02.620
What kind of dog?

21:02.720 --> 21:05.260
I don't know maybe one
of those little ones?

21:05.360 --> 21:08.460
You know, that you carry
around with you with long,

21:08.560 --> 21:10.580
white hair, what're they called?

21:10.680 --> 21:11.920
Maltese?

21:12.080 --> 21:15.846
Oh, shit. Shit, no, no!

21:15.960 --> 21:18.300
There is no way!

21:18.400 --> 21:20.880
There's no way I'm
living with a little dog!

21:23.080 --> 21:26.282
- I'm kidding!
- That's a deal breaker!

21:30.480 --> 21:35.611
And the one-two, swung on,
driven deep right center ﬁeld...

21:37.080 --> 21:38.809
Yeah!

21:40.120 --> 21:42.885
Made you a baseball fan, huh?

21:47.360 --> 21:48.620
Detective Hester.

21:48.720 --> 21:52.620
Christie Miller's manager just called,
she's leaving town, it's now or never.

21:52.720 --> 21:55.060
- I'll be there in half an hour.
- Go to home you idiot!

21:55.160 --> 21:56.571
You having a party?

21:56.800 --> 21:59.451
My sister's over, I'll see you.

22:01.520 --> 22:02.940
I got to go.

22:03.040 --> 22:05.930
- It's Saturday.
- Yeah, something's up.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.448
We're working the right lead.

22:14.560 --> 22:16.642
You want to put money on it?

22:17.920 --> 22:19.524
Give me a minute.

22:24.960 --> 22:27.660
Christie, can I talk to you for a sec?

22:27.760 --> 22:30.300
- What about?
- Your friend, Debbie Cherico.

22:30.400 --> 22:32.050
You're not in trouble, okay?

22:32.200 --> 22:33.460
I just want you to come
down to the station

22:33.560 --> 22:35.449
and talk to me for like 30 minutes.

22:36.840 --> 22:38.490
Christie, stop!

22:39.240 --> 22:40.969
- Come on.
- Stop the car!

22:41.760 --> 22:43.250
Stop! Laurel!

22:43.360 --> 22:44.885
Get away, bitch!

22:51.360 --> 22:53.806
You okay, you hurt?

22:54.960 --> 22:56.580
I'm fine, I'm okay.

22:56.680 --> 22:57.761
Come on, Christie.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.420
Let's stop playing games right now, okay?

23:01.520 --> 23:04.660
You and Debbie were best friends,
went to high school together.

23:04.760 --> 23:07.940
You must've went by Tommy's
place at some point or another.

23:08.040 --> 23:10.580
Now, Tommy was moving dope for these guys.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.887
They were in and out of
his apartment all the time.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.780
You expect me to believe
you never saw him?

23:14.880 --> 23:17.580
I told you, I don't know anything.

23:17.680 --> 23:19.380
I don't believe you!

23:19.480 --> 23:21.244
I don't believe you.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.243
Can I talk to Christie alone?

23:24.240 --> 23:25.924
Sure.

23:26.040 --> 23:29.647
Come on, Belkin, let's let
the ladies chat for a few minutes.

23:32.880 --> 23:35.900
I'm gonna turn this off so it's just us.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.809
What the hell's she doin'?

23:38.680 --> 23:40.250
No one needs to hear.

23:43.760 --> 23:45.683
I know you're scared.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.321
Nothing's gonna happen to you here.

23:51.480 --> 23:52.980
It's my job to protect you.

23:53.080 --> 23:55.287
Right.

23:56.920 --> 24:00.083
I know what it's like to be afraid.
It's not a nice feeling.

24:02.760 --> 24:05.286
You don't know anything about me.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.883
You're 19, right?

24:11.880 --> 24:15.780
When I was... when I was
a few years younger than you,

24:15.880 --> 24:21.060
like 16, there was something
in my life that I was,

24:21.160 --> 24:25.620
I was really scared of and trying to hide.

24:25.720 --> 24:28.460
And after a while I couldn't
take it anymore and I,

24:28.560 --> 24:31.860
um, I went to my mother and I
told her that I needed help.

24:31.960 --> 24:36.220
And I ended up in a
psychiatric institution.

24:36.320 --> 24:39.642
I was so scared I made myself sick,

24:40.640 --> 24:43.849
gave myself a nervous breakdown.

24:43.960 --> 24:46.531
And I thought I'd never survive it.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.060
But I did.

24:50.160 --> 24:52.780
I did survive it.

24:52.880 --> 24:57.060
And I learned that being
afraid and hiding things

24:57.160 --> 24:59.481
is a horrible way to live.

25:00.760 --> 25:04.060
And I don't want that for you.

25:04.160 --> 25:06.500
I want you to help me find
Debbie's killer so I can

25:06.600 --> 25:08.660
protect you from them.

25:08.760 --> 25:12.651
'Cause I don't want you to spend
the rest of your life being afraid.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.889
Okay.

25:32.880 --> 25:34.644
Okay.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.248
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:05.720 --> 26:08.644
I hope my directions didn't confuse you.

26:09.880 --> 26:13.566
Get ready, here come the dykes.

26:21.400 --> 26:24.140
The backyard is very private.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.402
Just like you wanted.

26:26.600 --> 26:29.683
And it's a sweet
neighborhood, all families.

26:30.680 --> 26:32.250
Which one of you is Ms. Hester?

26:32.400 --> 26:35.380
- I'm detective Hester.
- And you are a friend?

26:35.480 --> 26:38.340
- Yeah, she's my friend.
- Oh...

26:38.440 --> 26:41.603
Yeah, I'm her friend
who's also gonna live here.

26:42.640 --> 26:45.610
I'll just wait outside.

26:50.600 --> 26:54.650
- What a bitch.
- It needs a lot of work.

26:55.720 --> 26:57.484
There's plenty of light!

26:57.600 --> 27:00.020
Need more closet space, though.

27:00.120 --> 27:02.327
The garage is attached!

27:02.440 --> 27:08.020
And there's enough room for your car
and my truck, and my dad's Harley.

27:08.120 --> 27:11.124
You can't bring you dad's motorcycle.

27:11.240 --> 27:13.180
- What?
- No, it's too dangerous.

27:13.280 --> 27:14.860
I don't want to worry about
you every time you go out.

27:14.960 --> 27:17.580
But... I'll let you get a dog.

27:17.680 --> 27:19.887
You'll let me, you'll let me?

27:21.040 --> 27:24.931
- You like it?
- Yeah, a lot.

27:29.280 --> 27:32.380
There's no way I can afford this mortgage.

27:32.480 --> 27:35.165
- Not even half.
- Yeah, I'll take out the loan.

27:35.280 --> 27:39.604
I mean, I can do the renovation,
I can paint and dry wall.

27:39.720 --> 27:43.260
- You can dry wall?
- Hell yeah.

27:43.360 --> 27:45.283
That's sexy.

27:48.080 --> 27:52.688
- So, we have a house?
- Yeah, we have a house!

27:59.160 --> 28:02.004
You're... the shit at that.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.128
- Thanks, Mom.
- Of course.

29:09.880 --> 29:12.008
You two are a long way from home.

29:15.440 --> 29:16.980
Okay.

29:17.080 --> 29:19.540
Got your three forms of ID,

29:19.640 --> 29:22.700
proof of common assets and common domain,

29:22.800 --> 29:25.610
a shared bank account, a deed.

29:25.760 --> 29:27.180
Give me a second here.

29:27.280 --> 29:29.500
This domestic partnership thing is new.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.260
Take your time.

29:31.360 --> 29:32.820
When people get married

29:32.920 --> 29:35.287
they don't have to go through
this whole ordeal.

29:39.600 --> 29:42.285
Well, that's it.

29:45.360 --> 29:47.089
Thanks.

29:50.680 --> 29:53.020
Happy domestic partnership day.

29:53.120 --> 29:54.281
Thank you.

29:54.400 --> 29:57.290
- I got something for you.
- Yeah?

29:57.440 --> 30:00.171
Looks like the beach.

30:02.240 --> 30:05.900
Thanks. I got something for you too.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.843
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:08.480 --> 30:13.420
It's a card from the police union,
got your name on it,

30:13.520 --> 30:15.124
it says we're family.

30:16.600 --> 30:18.648
So, if you're stopped
while you're driving,

30:18.800 --> 30:20.860
and let's face it, you do drive fast,

30:20.960 --> 30:23.691
just give this to the officer,
you won't get a ticket.

30:26.640 --> 30:28.130
Family.

30:29.280 --> 30:31.681
Guess that makes it official, huh?

30:32.320 --> 30:34.288
Official, baby.

30:51.920 --> 30:55.420
I have a certificate
in computer diagnostics

30:55.520 --> 30:59.684
and I can do engine work
and electrical and...

30:59.840 --> 31:02.207
You're like four feet tall.

31:03.680 --> 31:05.728
How long is your fastest tire rotation?

31:05.880 --> 31:08.180
Eight minutes, my guys are good.

31:08.280 --> 31:09.725
Well, I can beat that.

31:11.320 --> 31:15.211
Derek's our rotation champ.
You can't beat him.

31:16.360 --> 31:17.725
Do you want to bet?

31:24.160 --> 31:26.322
This is a waste of time.

31:29.040 --> 31:30.485
Go.

31:45.200 --> 31:48.761
Tire weighs as much as you, sweetheart,
sure you can handle it?

32:19.800 --> 32:22.246
- Done!
- Wait, what?

32:23.240 --> 32:24.651
No way.

32:25.400 --> 32:27.940
Seven minutes, twelve seconds.
That's gotta be a record.

32:28.040 --> 32:29.451
So I got the job?

32:29.560 --> 32:31.608
Oh, so she can change tires, so what?

32:31.760 --> 32:33.340
We need a real mechanic in here, Jake!

32:33.440 --> 32:36.046
I can do my job, thanks.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.684
See you tomorrow morning at eight AM.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.564
You better be good!

32:51.640 --> 32:55.645
- Congratulations on the job.
- Thanks.

32:55.760 --> 32:59.380
I'm gonna make a contribution
to the mortgage every month.

32:59.480 --> 33:02.460
- You don't have to do that.
- Yeah, I do.

33:02.560 --> 33:06.804
I kind of like the idea
of you as a kept woman, it's sexy.

33:08.280 --> 33:10.260
Kind of makes you feel
like you're in charge, huh?

33:10.360 --> 33:12.540
I know I'm not in charge of you,
sweetie, it's impossible.

33:12.640 --> 33:15.246
Doesn't stop you from trying.

33:16.440 --> 33:18.886
- Oh, God.
- What's the matter?

33:19.000 --> 33:21.580
- Oh, I think I pulled a muscle.
- Yeah?

33:21.680 --> 33:24.411
- How long have you had that?
- A couple weeks.

33:24.520 --> 33:25.940
Couple weeks?

33:26.040 --> 33:27.940
- Yeah.
- Will you get it checked out?

33:28.040 --> 33:29.980
Yeah.

33:30.080 --> 33:31.340
- This week?
- Sure.

33:31.440 --> 33:33.260
- Tomorrow?
- I will!

33:33.360 --> 33:35.420
Don't look so worried,
I pulled a muscle on the job,

33:35.520 --> 33:37.522
I'm a cop, that's what happens.

33:37.640 --> 33:40.689
I know, you're a superhero.

33:56.480 --> 33:58.403
Laurel, want to come in?

34:18.320 --> 34:19.889
Hey.

34:20.440 --> 34:21.929
Hey.

34:25.080 --> 34:28.659
Can I... can I help you?

34:28.760 --> 34:33.340
Yeah, I dropped by to see Laurel.

34:33.440 --> 34:35.219
Laurel Hester, this is her house?

34:35.320 --> 34:37.208
- She here?
- Yeah.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.571
Is that, is that a rowdy?

34:39.679 --> 34:42.763
That's what the fellow
at the nursery told me.

34:42.880 --> 34:45.087
You doing the landscaping?

34:45.960 --> 34:47.803
- Hey.
- Hey!

34:47.920 --> 34:51.820
I dropped by to give you
a housewarming present,

34:51.920 --> 34:52.920
figured it was kind of overdue.

34:53.080 --> 34:56.020
Hey, thanks. Did you meet Stacie?

34:56.120 --> 35:00.260
Yeah, he thinks I'm the,
thinks I'm the gardener.

35:00.360 --> 35:03.762
No, oh, Stacie's my roommate.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.700
Oh, great.

35:07.800 --> 35:11.247
Yeah, it's great.

35:13.320 --> 35:14.606
Well, I didn't mean to...

35:14.720 --> 35:17.849
I just wanted to wish you
good luck with the house and...

35:17.960 --> 35:20.420
- Thanks.
- I'll see you Monday.

35:20.520 --> 35:22.860
I'll see you Monday,
thanks for stopping by.

35:22.960 --> 35:26.123
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

35:30.360 --> 35:32.328
Roommates don't sleep in the same bed.

35:32.440 --> 35:34.460
- He's my partner.
- No, I'm your partner.

35:34.560 --> 35:36.340
That is the person you work with.

35:36.440 --> 35:37.851
And he's got a total crush on you.

35:37.960 --> 35:40.531
- No he doesn't.
- Yes, he does.

35:42.200 --> 35:45.010
Hey! Wait a minute!

35:46.800 --> 35:50.620
Sorry, it's a bad cop habit,
showing up unannounced.

35:50.720 --> 35:54.486
Stacie's not my roommate,
she's my girlfriend.

35:56.560 --> 35:58.642
Why the hell didn't you tell me?

35:58.800 --> 36:03.840
Never came up. Never saw
any reason to talk about it.

36:07.560 --> 36:09.403
Remember when I found
out I had a daughter?

36:10.480 --> 36:12.500
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:12.600 --> 36:16.340
That wasn't my proudest moment,
but I told you about it, you know why?

36:16.440 --> 36:19.011
Because you count on me, right?

36:19.160 --> 36:20.580
Yeah.

36:20.680 --> 36:21.900
When things are happening,
we get in a situation,

36:22.000 --> 36:24.740
people are reaching for their guns,
you need to know what's going on with me.

36:24.840 --> 36:26.780
Am I up, am I down,
am I distracted, in love?

36:26.880 --> 36:28.848
Whatever, your life depends on it!

36:28.960 --> 36:30.980
And all these years you been holding back

36:31.080 --> 36:32.660
this part of yourself because, what?

36:32.760 --> 36:34.460
Because you didn't trust me
enough to say anything.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.300
- Come on! You think I could've...
- Thanks a lot!

36:36.400 --> 36:37.980
I could've been out at
work and gotten anywhere

36:38.080 --> 36:39.923
beyond back office filing reports?

36:40.040 --> 36:41.820
You don't get it,
you know, you're straight,

36:41.920 --> 36:43.700
you're white, you're male, this is not...

36:43.800 --> 36:45.620
- Don't give me that bullshit.
- No, no, it is not bullshit.

36:45.720 --> 36:47.980
Things are handed to you I have to
fight for, that's the way it is!

36:48.080 --> 36:51.140
Oh, boo-hoo. So you're the oppressed
minority now, is that it?

36:51.240 --> 36:52.526
Yeah.

37:08.520 --> 37:11.420
Are the other cops' wives gonna be there?

37:11.520 --> 37:13.340
Yeah, probably.

37:13.440 --> 37:16.220
We, you know, all have to go,
it's the chief's birthday.

37:16.320 --> 37:18.980
Yeah, well, it kind of sucks, doesn't it?

37:19.080 --> 37:21.220
Yeah, it does.

37:21.320 --> 37:23.540
It does suck, but that's how it is right?

37:23.640 --> 37:25.130
You know that.

37:31.080 --> 37:35.180
Look, I don't have to go.
I could stay home.

37:35.280 --> 37:37.647
You want me to stay home, babe?

37:44.360 --> 37:46.044
No.

37:47.400 --> 37:49.767
I mean, you want to
make lieutenant, right?

37:49.880 --> 37:54.460
- First woman in Ocean County.
- That's the plan.

37:54.560 --> 37:56.660
- Go.
- Okay.

37:56.760 --> 38:00.220
This is Laurel Hester,
please leave a message.

38:00.320 --> 38:04.689
Laurel, it's Dr. Tonner, please call me
back as soon as you get this message.

38:06.360 --> 38:08.567
Hello, it's Laurel Hester.

38:56.360 --> 39:00.001
I'm waiting for Laurel, it's been hours.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.009
You're waiting for Laurel Hester?

39:02.120 --> 39:03.340
Right.

39:03.440 --> 39:06.300
- You're her sister?
- Partner.

39:06.400 --> 39:09.660
Oh, I was expecting a family member.

39:09.760 --> 39:12.700
She's my partner!

39:12.800 --> 39:15.580
Or my wife, or whatever, and
I know that something's wrong!

39:15.680 --> 39:19.571
Okay, please, calm down, I'm sorry.

39:21.040 --> 39:24.567
The results of the bronchoscopy
are very concerning.

39:27.360 --> 39:30.409
Laurel has three masses in her right lung.

39:32.640 --> 39:34.961
Masses...

39:36.720 --> 39:38.500
You mean cancer?

39:38.600 --> 39:42.140
It's not definitive until we get
the results back from the lab.

39:42.240 --> 39:45.642
But, yes, it's probably late stage cancer.

39:48.040 --> 39:51.249
Now, we do have treatment options...

40:06.240 --> 40:08.129
Where are you going?

40:08.240 --> 40:10.447
They told you everything?

40:11.480 --> 40:13.289
Yeah.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.128
But we're, we're gonna fight this.

40:17.240 --> 40:21.020
We're gonna get the best treatment
and I'm gonna take off work

40:21.120 --> 40:23.980
and help you and my mom
can come stay with us.

40:24.080 --> 40:26.540
- Right, but I think that...
- It'll be okay.

40:26.640 --> 40:27.820
We need...

40:27.920 --> 40:30.820
I can't pull up, Christ!

40:30.920 --> 40:33.460
Did the doctor tell you
about the su*ival rate?

40:33.560 --> 40:35.722
Yeah.

40:37.160 --> 40:40.164
Yeah, but, you know,
we're gonna beat this.

40:40.280 --> 40:42.442
We're gonna beat this.

40:43.840 --> 40:45.649
We will.

41:17.160 --> 41:18.810
How you doing?

41:21.280 --> 41:22.327
Okay.

41:24.760 --> 41:28.970
You know, start my
treatment next week, so...

41:37.640 --> 41:40.100
- I'm sorry.
- Nah, it's okay.

41:40.200 --> 41:46.580
You've seen me playing at compromised
situations drunk off my ass.

41:46.680 --> 41:50.620
Listen, I know it's a cliché,
but if there's anything I can do.

41:50.720 --> 41:52.529
Yeah, you know.

41:54.160 --> 41:58.085
If something happens,
I want my pension to go to Stacie

41:58.200 --> 42:01.010
'cause it's the only way she
can afford to keep our house.

42:01.120 --> 42:04.363
But that's for married people, ain't it?

42:13.040 --> 42:14.644
Thanks for the support.

42:18.760 --> 42:20.410
- Laurel.
- It's alright, man.

43:37.480 --> 43:40.020
Sweetie, sweetie?

43:40.120 --> 43:42.202
I don't want you to see this.

43:55.480 --> 43:57.209
Alright, here.

43:57.320 --> 43:59.049
Pass that around.

44:04.280 --> 44:07.580
Alright so this is from
Detective Laurel Hester

44:07.680 --> 44:09.580
who's currently on medical
leave of absence because,

44:09.680 --> 44:12.580
unfortunately, she has stage four cancer.

44:12.680 --> 44:15.580
And she's asking that in
the event of her death,

44:15.680 --> 44:19.220
her pension benefits be assigned
to her partner, Stacie Andree.

44:19.320 --> 44:22.608
- Stacie Andree is a woman, correct?
- Correct.

44:22.720 --> 44:26.220
I'm just trying to wrap my mind
around her being a lesbian.

44:26.320 --> 44:27.446
Why?

44:27.560 --> 44:30.780
Well, she's so not like a lesbian.

44:30.880 --> 44:32.740
The contract we negotiated
with the police union

44:32.840 --> 44:34.410
doesn't give Detective Hester the right

44:34.520 --> 44:38.060
to assign her benefits
to her roommate, end of story.

44:38.160 --> 44:40.811
Alright, so motion to deny
Detective Hester's request?

44:43.680 --> 44:50.660
Well, actually, the Domestic Partnership
Act passed by the state legislature

44:50.760 --> 44:53.660
extends benefits to same sex
partners of state employees.

44:53.760 --> 44:55.940
Hester's a county employee.

44:56.040 --> 45:00.180
But the law says we can
assign benefits to county employees.

45:00.280 --> 45:02.460
Right, and bankrupt the county.

45:02.560 --> 45:05.300
- Come on.
- No, come on, what?

45:05.400 --> 45:08.180
People can make anybody their
partners and get benefits?

45:08.280 --> 45:10.860
It's really very hard
to form a domestic partnership,

45:10.960 --> 45:12.260
actually, harder than marriage.

45:12.360 --> 45:14.567
Nothing's harder than marriage.

45:15.880 --> 45:18.780
Bryan, the law you're
talking about violates

45:18.880 --> 45:20.100
the sanctity of marriage.

45:20.200 --> 45:25.411
It offends traditional values, and in
this county, that's political suicide.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.604
She's dying.

45:28.720 --> 45:32.500
Yes, and that's a personal tragedy
and we deal in public policy here.

45:32.600 --> 45:35.444
But I move that we deny
Detective Hester's request,

45:35.560 --> 45:39.406
we should wish her the best
and tell her she's in our prayers.

45:39.520 --> 45:42.922
- Alright, all in favor?
- Yes.

45:43.960 --> 45:48.740
- Brian?
- Oh, abstain.

45:48.840 --> 45:52.820
We like our decisions to have
the authority of unanimous vote.

45:52.920 --> 45:56.003
It's been our tradition for 150 years.

45:59.800 --> 46:04.340
- Yes.
- Good.

46:04.440 --> 46:09.380
The technician said that you just suck in

46:09.480 --> 46:13.280
and hold the medicine
in your lungs as long as you can.

46:13.400 --> 46:14.925
Okay.

46:20.640 --> 46:22.449
You okay?

46:29.560 --> 46:32.340
We're in the middle of treatment, so...

46:32.440 --> 46:35.410
Hey! It's okay, come in!

46:35.520 --> 46:38.780
That's my sister, Lindy.
Lindy, that's Dane.

46:38.880 --> 46:40.689
Hey.

46:44.160 --> 46:47.740
Well, they turned you down Laurel

46:47.840 --> 46:50.684
and then they buried the decision
in the back of the paper.

46:50.800 --> 46:52.380
Yeah, I saw.

46:52.480 --> 46:56.100
So, I just wanted you to
know I'm not happy about it.

46:56.200 --> 46:57.940
- Yeah, thanks.
- Laurel, treatment.

46:58.040 --> 46:59.644
There's one other thing we could try.

46:59.800 --> 47:01.900
What's that?

47:02.000 --> 47:04.651
These guys are terrified of controversy.

47:04.840 --> 47:06.888
If you go to one of their meetings.

47:08.280 --> 47:10.940
You mean, in person, make a speech?

47:11.040 --> 47:12.724
- Make a request.
- Laurel.

47:12.840 --> 47:15.571
They have a public
meeting every two weeks.

47:15.680 --> 47:17.569
In front of everyone?

47:17.680 --> 47:19.100
Yeah, so then everyone knows our business?

47:19.200 --> 47:20.620
I mean, who are these people?

47:20.720 --> 47:24.020
They're the local government,
they run Ocean County.

47:24.120 --> 47:26.820
It's gonna be a lot harder
for them to shoot you down

47:26.920 --> 47:30.260
if you go in there face to face
and ask for what you got coming to you.

47:30.360 --> 47:31.820
You deserve it.

47:31.920 --> 47:33.140
Laurel, do the treatment,
I gotta go to work!

47:33.240 --> 47:34.580
Okay, okay.

47:34.680 --> 47:37.729
This whole pension thing
is a waste of time, okay?

47:37.840 --> 47:39.524
She's not gonna need it
'cause she's gonna get better,

47:39.640 --> 47:42.041
can you stop bothering
us with this bullshit?

47:48.680 --> 47:50.260
This is so hard for her.

47:50.360 --> 47:53.364
Laurel, you gotta go
to one of these meetings.

47:53.480 --> 47:55.721
It's the only thing that could work.

47:58.720 --> 48:01.883
My relationship to the patient is partner!

48:04.000 --> 48:06.128
I've been through this with you...

48:09.240 --> 48:12.926
This bill from Sloan Kettering for $900.

48:34.920 --> 48:37.180
I know that some members
of the public have questioned

48:37.280 --> 48:40.409
the cause for the parking meters,
but after careful review,

48:40.520 --> 48:43.260
we think it would be the
best thing for the community.

48:43.360 --> 48:46.340
So, motion to approve the new meters.

48:46.440 --> 48:48.060
- So moved.
- How do you vote?

48:48.160 --> 48:49.605
Yes.

48:49.720 --> 48:52.121
- You okay?
- Motion's passed.

48:52.240 --> 48:54.766
- Don Bennin is here.
- Hey, sis.

48:54.920 --> 48:57.366
- Who's that?
- He's a reporter.

48:58.320 --> 48:59.810
Is he gonna write about this?

48:59.920 --> 49:01.649
Yeah, probably.

49:04.600 --> 49:06.500
Well that takes care of all the

49:06.600 --> 49:10.300
items on our agenda and unless
anyone has anymore questions,

49:10.400 --> 49:12.180
we will call this meeting to a close.

49:12.280 --> 49:13.327
Yes?

49:19.280 --> 49:20.740
Good afternoon, freeholders.

49:20.840 --> 49:23.140
You have a question
about the parking meters?

49:23.240 --> 49:26.801
No, my name is Detective Laurel Hester.

49:26.960 --> 49:28.849
Hopefully you remember me from...

49:28.960 --> 49:31.361
Of course, I'm sorry,
I didn't recognize you, hello.

49:33.480 --> 49:37.380
I've worked for the Ocean County
Police Department for 23 years.

49:37.480 --> 49:42.486
I'm here today with my
partner, Stacie Andree.

49:45.000 --> 49:49.300
In my career I've been
shot at, dragged by a car,

49:49.400 --> 49:52.260
clubbed, beaten, punched, and kicked,

49:52.360 --> 49:54.380
but I've always come out on top.

49:54.480 --> 49:57.300
I've never been afraid of
injury or death while performing

49:57.400 --> 50:01.100
my duties, that's the job
and I love my job.

50:01.200 --> 50:05.620
Recently I was diagnosed
with stage four lung cancer.

50:05.720 --> 50:08.690
Although radiation has shrunk the tumors,

50:08.800 --> 50:11.620
my chances for survival
remain less than 10 percent.

50:11.720 --> 50:15.780
It's possible I've finally
met an opponent I can't beat.

50:15.880 --> 50:19.420
Please reconsider your
decision and grant my request

50:19.520 --> 50:22.580
to assign my pension benefits to Stacie.

50:22.680 --> 50:27.580
Making it possible for her to
stay in our home when I'm gone.

50:27.680 --> 50:31.620
When my heterosexual colleagues die,
their pensions go to their spouses.

50:31.720 --> 50:37.660
But because my partner is a woman,
I don't get to do that.

50:37.760 --> 50:43.380
In my 23 years as a police
officer I've never asked

50:43.480 --> 50:49.044
for special treatment,
I'm only asking for equality.

50:52.560 --> 50:53.561
Thank you.

50:55.880 --> 50:59.220
We commend you for your
service to the county,

50:59.320 --> 51:02.140
you're a valuable and trusted employee.

51:02.240 --> 51:04.180
- Agreed.
- Thank you.

51:04.280 --> 51:07.620
My colleagues and I, we've
anguished over your situation,

51:07.720 --> 51:12.100
but benefits for county employees
are part of a negotiated

51:12.200 --> 51:14.620
contractual settlement
and we just can't re-open

51:14.720 --> 51:17.700
- negotiation at this time...
- She gave you 23 years of service!

51:17.800 --> 51:20.420
You're out of order, Dane.

51:20.520 --> 51:23.126
God bless you, this meeting is adjourned.

51:38.160 --> 51:40.260
Hey.

51:40.360 --> 51:41.820
Detective Hester, how about an interview?

51:41.920 --> 51:43.420
- Not today.
- Please leave us alone.

51:43.520 --> 51:45.820
Listen, I'll set up an interview

51:45.920 --> 51:48.460
if you promise to put
her story on the front page.

51:48.560 --> 51:51.140
Done. Did you see those guys squirm?

51:51.240 --> 51:53.580
No one ever questions them about anything.

51:53.680 --> 51:55.011
Well, they should.

51:55.120 --> 51:58.849
My partner spends her life fighting
for justice, they deny justice to her.

51:58.960 --> 52:01.167
That, that is great.

52:20.160 --> 52:21.700
Dane Wells.

52:21.800 --> 52:24.700
This is Steven Goldstein
from Garden State Equality.

52:24.800 --> 52:27.620
I just wanted to call to tell
you that we are all outraged

52:27.720 --> 52:29.500
about what's happening to Laurel Hester

52:29.600 --> 52:32.410
and we would like to help.

52:33.840 --> 52:35.251
Okay.

52:37.280 --> 52:40.540
What these freeholders
are doing is unconscionable.

52:40.640 --> 52:42.380
We need to let them know

52:42.480 --> 52:45.566
that either they reverse their decision
or there are going to be consequences.

52:45.680 --> 52:47.682
They've never reversed a decision.

52:47.800 --> 52:49.500
They have never met me before.

52:49.600 --> 52:52.683
Their next meeting we show
up with 100 protesters.

52:52.800 --> 52:56.043
Gay cops, gay attorneys,
a priest, a rabbi,

52:56.160 --> 52:57.460
I know a couple gay grandmothers.

52:57.560 --> 52:59.460
Maybe we organize a gay pride parade!

52:59.560 --> 53:01.460
You mean a bunch of bare
chested men in leather

53:01.560 --> 53:03.050
marching down Main Street?

53:03.200 --> 53:06.010
We show them that we are
a force to be reckoned with.

53:06.200 --> 53:07.884
In this county there are

53:08.000 --> 53:10.780
a quarter million senior citizens
registered Republicans.

53:10.880 --> 53:12.260
You're gonna turn them all against Laurel.

53:12.360 --> 53:15.740
I appreciate your perspective,
I ran Corzine's senate campaign in 2000,

53:15.840 --> 53:16.921
so I know what I'm doing.

53:17.040 --> 53:18.500
Okay, Steve, but I know this community.

53:18.600 --> 53:21.300
It's Steven, with a V, as in very gay.

53:21.400 --> 53:24.780
And when people disrespect
my gay brothers and sisters,

53:24.880 --> 53:27.884
I rain terror on them!

53:28.000 --> 53:31.925
Shock and awe, shock and awe!

53:32.040 --> 53:36.780
Sweetheart, I am going to need you
to be available for interviews.

53:36.880 --> 53:38.245
Lots and lots of interviews.

53:38.360 --> 53:39.820
This is gonna be a national news story.

53:39.920 --> 53:43.083
Steven, it seems to me
that you're using my case

53:43.240 --> 53:45.700
to promote your cause, gay marriage.

53:45.800 --> 53:47.723
That is exactly what I'm doing.

53:47.840 --> 53:50.890
This is the case that I've been waiting
for, that I've been dreaming about.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.500
This is going to put this issue
in the national spotlight,

53:53.600 --> 53:56.180
it is going to turn
the tide for gay marriage.

53:56.280 --> 54:01.180
My fight is not about
marriage, it's about equality.

54:01.280 --> 54:02.770
It's about a cop getting
the benefits she deserv...

54:02.880 --> 54:05.500
Not about marriage, are you kidding me?

54:05.600 --> 54:09.366
I'm sorry. I just,
I'm very passionate about this.

54:10.920 --> 54:14.220
If you were married,
and not this bullshit,

54:14.320 --> 54:16.322
second-class citizen
domestic partner crap,

54:16.440 --> 54:18.090
but married, there wouldn't be an issue.

54:18.240 --> 54:20.460
Stacie would be entitled to your benefits.

54:20.560 --> 54:23.620
Hell, if you and I got married tomorrow,
I'd be entitled to your benefits.

54:23.720 --> 54:27.930
- Is that a proposal?
- Oh, honey, I will marry you.

54:28.040 --> 54:30.441
But I wouldn't know what
to do with your vagina.

54:31.400 --> 54:33.860
Oh, my God.

54:33.960 --> 54:39.500
I just don't want this whole
political thing to take over our lives.

54:39.600 --> 54:41.340
We need to get you better.

54:41.440 --> 54:42.900
All this hoopla isn't necessary.

54:43.000 --> 54:44.809
All we need are Ocean County voters

54:44.920 --> 54:46.780
at the next freeholder meeting.

54:46.880 --> 54:50.009
Radicals and strangers from New York
aren't gonna convince these guys.

54:50.120 --> 54:53.488
I am not a radical,
and I am not from New York.

54:53.600 --> 54:56.660
I am a middle-class Jewish
homosexual from New Jersey.

54:56.760 --> 54:58.171
How about you, sweetheart?

54:58.280 --> 55:00.500
I'm a straight, white,

55:00.600 --> 55:05.260
anglosex and ex-protestant, atheist cop.

55:05.360 --> 55:07.500
You okay with that, sweetheart?

55:07.600 --> 55:10.444
I am, that is very hot.

55:15.200 --> 55:18.363
It's an opportunity to change the world.

55:19.360 --> 55:21.806
Laurel, this can be your legacy.

55:25.200 --> 55:29.171
It is not a local story, Mark, it's an
outrageous miscarriage of justice.

55:29.320 --> 55:33.041
I'm giving you the opportunity
to cover this nationally.

55:33.800 --> 55:35.540
Yes.

55:35.640 --> 55:38.540
Okay, well you know what,
if your editor doesn't see

55:38.640 --> 55:41.291
how important this story is,
then he is an idiot,

55:41.400 --> 55:43.420
or a closeted homophobe.

55:43.520 --> 55:45.682
Yes, you heard me.

55:46.680 --> 55:48.842
We need more Entenmann's!

55:54.160 --> 55:56.162
Hey, you got room, you can pull up.

55:57.440 --> 55:59.090
Why don't you get out of our town!

55:59.200 --> 56:01.043
Just get out of here, you lesbian bitch!

56:03.520 --> 56:05.648
Get the hell out of here, get out!

56:06.640 --> 56:09.962
- Assholes!
- God damn dyke!

56:11.560 --> 56:14.689
- You okay?
- Yeah.

56:17.960 --> 56:21.009
Hello? What?

56:22.160 --> 56:24.242
I'm coming.

56:25.040 --> 56:26.929
Go!

56:29.480 --> 56:31.881
Laurel, Mom, what happened?

56:32.000 --> 56:35.282
All of a sudden she was so confused,
she didn't know where she was and I,

56:35.400 --> 56:36.740
I didn't know what to do.

56:36.840 --> 56:38.524
- You're okay.
- She'll gonna be okay.

56:39.280 --> 56:41.180
Patients only!

56:41.280 --> 56:44.682
Laurel, I love you!

56:45.480 --> 56:47.289
I love you!

56:56.000 --> 56:57.650
What's going on?

57:03.080 --> 57:07.688
Cancer, um, spread to her brain.

57:10.320 --> 57:16.601
And her lymph nodes and the...
side of her neck.

57:17.320 --> 57:18.481
Jesus.

57:19.280 --> 57:21.442
The doctor said that...

57:25.640 --> 57:29.964
that we're not trying
to cure anything anymore.

57:33.920 --> 57:37.447
That we're just trying
to buy a little time.

57:38.160 --> 57:40.128
I...

57:49.080 --> 57:52.050
I thought we had a few years.

57:57.880 --> 58:01.123
I had myself convinced.

58:01.680 --> 58:04.365
Oh, God.

58:05.480 --> 58:07.620
So, the meeting's tomorrow?

58:07.720 --> 58:09.220
Yeah.

58:09.320 --> 58:11.322
Steven's got all kinds of
big things in the works.

58:11.480 --> 58:13.220
Protesters, speeches, who knows,

58:13.320 --> 58:15.060
he might shoot himself out of a cannon.

58:15.160 --> 58:18.060
Wrapped in a rainbow flag.

58:18.160 --> 58:21.820
Well, if we win, I hope
I'm still around to see it.

58:21.920 --> 58:25.740
Hey... Hey, don't talk like that.

58:25.840 --> 58:28.060
They're gonna get you all sorted
out with this radiation thing.

58:28.160 --> 58:33.003
I have a very sensitive bullshit meter
and it's ringing off the hook right now.

58:33.120 --> 58:35.771
I expect the truth from you, partner.

58:37.920 --> 58:39.604
Okay.

58:42.360 --> 58:44.780
I'm worried about Stacie.

58:44.880 --> 58:49.700
Yeah, you know, she's trying to accept it.

58:49.800 --> 58:53.260
She's had so much to deal with,
you know, she's so young.

58:53.360 --> 58:55.124
It's not fair.

58:56.200 --> 58:58.300
Life's not fair.

58:58.400 --> 59:00.528
No, it isn't.

59:04.560 --> 59:08.201
Sorry I never told you
the truth all those years.

59:08.320 --> 59:11.900
You know, maybe I wanted
people to think we were

59:12.000 --> 59:16.130
into each other, it was just
easier, you know, for me.

59:18.720 --> 59:22.964
Maybe I thought you wouldn't
want to be my friend.

59:25.560 --> 59:28.006
I should've known better.

59:29.560 --> 59:32.211
I have no regrets.

59:37.040 --> 59:40.089
Justice for Laurel!

59:42.960 --> 59:47.140
Everyone. Energy, energy!

59:47.240 --> 59:50.881
Justice for Laurel, justice for Laurel!

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.010
Hi, sweetie, are you one of us?

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:06.290
- No, I'm not.
- Do you want to be?

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:10.620
I can make it happen.

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:11.700
Come on, guys.

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.220
The more of us show up

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:14.620
at this meeting the more

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:16.324
they know the department's behind her.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:19.444
And if they say yes then my tax
dollars go to her girlfriend.

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.284
Yeah.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.131
Yeah, the same way your wife
gets your pension if you die.

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:26.740
Yeah, but she's my wife!

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:29.580
Look, the chief says
it's a political issue

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:32.660
and we can't take sides.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:36.287
What's political about a cop
getting screwed out of her pension?

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.122
Who's coming to the meeting?

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:45.420
Oh, don't put yourselves out.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.363
She'd back up any of you in a heartbeat!

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.220
And she's dying!

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:52.164
But hey, you know, she's a
dyke so who gives a shit?

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.647
Cowards.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.900
Well, now we know for sure.
Dane Wells is a fag.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.660
Why don't you just back off?

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:07.240
Why don't you just let me know when
you're gonna come out of the closet, Julio?

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.890
Dane!

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:22.687
I just wanted to say that I think
you're doing the right thing.

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.921
Show up for Laurel.

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.849
I can't.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.620
I'm sorry.

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.963
We never had this conversation.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:43.260
You have the power!

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:46.780
- You can do this.
- It's not in our hands.

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:48.060
It is in your hands!

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:50.300
You have the power!

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.210
Ladies and gentlemen. Please sit down.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.209
Please.

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:56.606
You can do this! You can do this!

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.531
This all came out in
the shower this morning.

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.722
I got this.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:21.408
You're so professional.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.740
- I try.
- No, it's good.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.888
You do good.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.127
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.980
I know I'm the type of guy who scares you.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.900
I'm a big, loud, gay Jew.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.820
You don't scare me.

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:56.448
Laurel Hester gave the
citizens of Ocean County justice

01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:01.540
for 23 years, and now she's asking you
to give her justice in return!

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:04.060
- You have the power!
- We don't have that option.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.140
You do!

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.288
The Domestic Partnership Act

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:10.180
gives you the option to grant benefits!

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:13.363
You have the power!

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.980
This is not a local crowd,
they've been shipped in here.

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.684
No, I see some locals.

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.810
Please, please.

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.820
It is in your hands!

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:33.641
Ocean County cannot afford to do this.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.087
Actually, we can afford it.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:43.580
The question is, who tells us
how to spend the county's money?

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:46.220
That is for us and our
constituents to decide.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:49.085
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:59.180
Shame on you!

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.140
- Yes? Hello.
- Hello.

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:06.340
Father John Thompson Quarty,

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:07.780
St. Mary's Episcopal church,
Point Pleasant Beach.

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:09.166
Laurel and Stacie have been to my church.

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:12.940
Now, I have heard that
some of you believe that

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:15.725
Laurel Hester's relationship
with Stacie Andree

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:20.420
is not sanctioned by God and that's why
you are taking this position...

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:21.900
No, no father...

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.420
Would you like to hear what Jesus
actually said about homosexuality?

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:31.570
I will tell you what
he said, and I quote...

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:41.660
That's right, Jesus
said nothing on the subject!

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:46.288
- But he said plenty about compassion!
- He didn't say anything!

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:49.210
Please.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:55.660
Well, father, there are definitely
old testament verses that talk...

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:58.684
- You want to get sued here?
- Don't cut me off.

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:04.220
Ladies and gentlemen,
I understand this issue,

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.607
my uncle died of lung
cancer, it's terrible.

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:09.060
And I have always tried
to do the right thing,

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:11.460
but we need to look at the total picture.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:14.900
Please, please, please, I am begging you,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.606
I am begging you, do this for Laurel!

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:19.700
- You can do this!
- You have the power.

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:21.300
- You have the power.
- You have the power!

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.660
You have the power!

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:27.340
Get off your knees.

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:31.420
Listen to me, listen to me,
this is a circus, it's gonna backfire.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.860
It's political theater.

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:35.645
And you know what, if you think
you can do better, there's the mic!

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:38.127
Unless you're afraid
they're gonna think you're gay.

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:43.964
Alright, alright!

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.980
- Hello Detective Wells.
- Hello.

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.605
Gentlemen.

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:54.340
I was born and raised in Ocean County,

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:59.970
I'm an Piney, or a constituent,
as Mr. Johnson would like to say.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.460
I'm straight, by the way.

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:11.380
I also happen to be Laurel Hester's
partner on the force.

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.300
We've worked together
for many, many years now

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:16.483
and I can tell you from
firsthand experience

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:21.208
that she is about as fine an officer
as Ocean County could hope to have.

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:32.840
Now, Laurel, Stacie, and I could
solve this problem real quick, okay?

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.340
I could go get a justice of the peace,

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.380
take them to Laurel,
and we could get married.

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:43.300
And then when she dies,
I'd get her pension, no questions asked.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:46.483
I could pass it along to Stacie,
no problem.

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:55.283
But we're not gonna do that because
Laurel would never agree to it.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.780
I used to tease Laurel about
her integrity, her ideals,

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:05.885
because I'm one of those
cynical hard ass cops who likes

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:09.580
to say he doesn't believe
in the system, or justice.

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:12.411
But Laurel does.

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:17.044
She believes in the whole deal.

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.300
So what's it gonna be,
can I go to Laurel right now

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:27.930
and tell her she can die
in peace with dignity,

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:30.420
because she was right?

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:35.890
Because in this one instance,
justice has prevailed?

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:53.562
Thank you Detective Wells.

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:57.060
We anguish over this situation.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:59.640
And Detective Hester is in our prayers.

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:01.260
But our decision's gonna have to stand.

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:04.489
The state made a bad law,
the state made a bad law

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.300
and it's up to them to fix it.

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:07.700
Not up to us!

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:10.100
So Detective Hester's request is denied.

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:12.407
This meeting is adjourned!

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:19.964
We tried the carrot,
now we're gonna try the stick!

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:23.140
The number one source of
income in this county is what?

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:25.660
Tourism! And what are we gonna do?

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:27.921
Boycott Ocean County!

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:31.340
Boycott Ocean County!
Boycott Ocean Country!

01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:33.500
What the hell were you
doing in there, Bryan? Huh?

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.300
I'm in agony over this, okay?

01:08:35.399 --> 01:08:37.801
My wife and daughter look at
me like I'm a serial killer.

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:39.740
I was watching you, you're on our side!

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:41.841
- I'm one vote out of five.
- Convince the others!

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.529
Oh, that's easy for you to say!

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.220
Where are your fellow cops?

01:08:45.319 --> 01:08:47.380
You can't even get them
to come to a meeting.

01:08:47.479 --> 01:08:50.300
Some people get a pension,
some people don't,

01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:53.006
some people get two or three,
life isn't fair.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.180
Does that help you sleep at night?

01:08:55.279 --> 01:08:57.567
Kiss my ass.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.569
Water?

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:47.484
Drink.

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.211
Thank you.

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:02.300
You look so tired.

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.300
Why don't you go home
and get some rest, huh?

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:05.740
- No.
- Come on.

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.888
No, I can't leave her. She needs me here.

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:10.340
Thanks, Mom.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.249
Hey.

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:19.780
They turned her down, again.

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.042
I don't even know if I can tell her.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.162
Tell him about the insurance.

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:26.884
- No.
- Tell him.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.321
Come on, tell me about the insurance.

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.121
I got this letter from
the insurance company,

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:35.971
just saying that she has
like three sick days left

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:40.620
and then she loses her medical benefits
and life insurance and everything.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:43.940
She's been fighting the insurance
companies, the doctors.

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.700
I can handle it.

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:48.963
- I'll do something.
- No, no.

01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:50.660
Come on, let me take care of it.

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:53.570
I need to do something, please.

01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.771
Okay.

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:06.326
- Okay.
- Thanks.

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:31.811
What's this?

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:36.968
Any officer can assign his or her
sick days to another officer.

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:39.580
Yeah, but what if you get sick?

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:41.420
You're not gonna get those days back!

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:43.900
Am I right, chief?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.580
You don't get 'em back.

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:48.762
So you're scewed.

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:10.886
You bleeding hearts.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.940
That dyke wouldn't do it for me.

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:17.168
Yeah, she would.

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.660
Fine.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:29.047
I'll give her one day.

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:33.050
One day!

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:37.245
- How about three?
- Don't push it.

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:38.580
Make it five, Toohey.

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:40.500
Fellas, fellas, don't pressure him.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:44.241
You never know, he might get the sniffles.

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:47.780
Alright, five.

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:49.803
Happy?

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:04.248
We're standing by our decision,
just keep your men in line.

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:08.087
So now the police department's against us?

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:11.044
They're donating sick days,
it doesn't mean anyone's against us.

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:12.940
Have you read the papers?
We're being ridiculed!

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.883
Yeah, by who,
the New York Times? Who cares.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.970
The local papers and supporting
Hester and I'm getting a lot of calls.

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.606
- Yeah, from outsiders!
- And from the locals, Bill.

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:26.180
It seems like we are
sticking to a losing position

01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:28.248
because of some personal beliefs.

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:30.140
Why shouldn't I vote according
to my personal beliefs?

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:31.401
I'm not ashamed of them!

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:34.900
We give in on this,
we are putting this state

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.700
one step closer to gay marriage,
and if I do that,

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:39.290
how can I face my family, huh?

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.243
My friends?

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:55.965
What?

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:59.500
Their Christmas is gonna suck.

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.460
- Who?
- Those women.

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.562
The ones you're screwing over.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:09.620
Mya... this is politics,

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:13.020
I'm running for re-election next year,
I can do a lot of good for our town,

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:15.220
but not if I lose my
job over this one thing.

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:16.660
You understand?

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:19.001
If you die, does mom get your pension?

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:25.580
What do you want, Dane?

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:28.740
What do you mean some people
get more than one pension?

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:30.365
I never said that.

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:32.860
Oh, yeah you did, something
about life isn't fair,

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:35.060
some people have a pension, some don't,

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:37.208
some have more than one.

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:40.164
Do the freeholders get multiple pensions?

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:45.124
I'm not gonna answer
that question directly.

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:49.060
It's in the public record,
payroll department,

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:50.969
and if you say I told you this,
I'll deny it.

01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:54.682
'Course you will.

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:12.168
I don't know who that is.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.660
- Hello?
- Hey I need to talk to Laurel.

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:18.500
- It's important.
- Okay.

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.250
Laurel, it's Dane.

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:24.540
Hey, partner.

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:28.140
Hey, remember the Selco case?
It was like five years ago?

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:30.208
Yeah, sure.

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:33.500
They hid their names
in the records somehow,

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.602
but you managed to find 'em anyway.

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:36.820
How'd you do that?

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:40.208
They used versions of their full names.

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:44.940
An initial and a middle name
or, two initials.

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:48.620
So a regular computer search
couldn't ﬁnd them.

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:52.964
Right, thanks, good night.

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:56.964
- Yeah.
- Get some rest.

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:15.300
So I think we're gonna start with a wide
and we're gonna move to a medium.

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:17.340
All that matters is the close-up, right?

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.180
Let me see what's going on
behind her eyes.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.700
- Hi, Stacie.
- Hi, Stacie.

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:22.290
We're gonna finish with the close.

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:25.210
It is a 30 second spot
supporting gay marriage.

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:28.620
I'm fighting for equality.

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:31.140
Laurel, come on!

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:33.580
Like it or not, you're an activist.

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:36.100
You're a gay marriage activist now.

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.700
Just say it.
Just say the M word, just once.

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:41.087
Equality.

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.740
Can I have a minute, just a minute?

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.740
Sure, yes.

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:48.046
We'll be back.

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:50.610
Let's step out, let's step out.

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:58.442
- What's wrong?
- Do you want some apple sauce?

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:02.685
No. What's wrong? What's wrong?

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.380
I hate how he pushes this stuff on you.

01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:08.482
- Well, it's okay.
- No.

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:11.180
It takes your energy
and then you don't want to eat.

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:12.940
No, I have to do it, you know?

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:15.820
I have to... I have to
do it while there's time.

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:18.700
There is, there is.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:19.980
- No.
- Yeah.

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:21.366
- We don't know that.
- Yeah.

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:24.529
We don't know that, baby.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:28.645
You know, in the time I have
left my priority is you.

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:33.164
I'm still a police officer.

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:36.329
We're taught to do the right thing.

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:39.140
I'm gonna do the right thing for you.

01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:45.486
The only thing I care about
is justice for the woman that I love.

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:49.804
And that's you.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.809
Is that okay?

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.970
Yeah.

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:12.123
When you see this,
I will have passed away...

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:16.300
from cancer.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:20.291
The county refused to give
death benefits to my partner.

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:26.045
Gay couples are fighting for equality.

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:29.201
Please support them.

01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:37.420
What makes you think
they'll change their minds?

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:40.500
Instinct and something I found
out about their pensions.

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:42.807
They need cover.

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:45.060
How about this?

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:48.243
How about the governor
says that thanks to the freeholders,

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:51.300
he realizes that the domestic
partnership law is flawed

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.971
and he is willing
to support changing the law.

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:56.300
That way they go from villains to heroes.

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:58.500
You have access to the governor?

01:18:58.600 --> 01:18:59.860
Oh, honey, are you kidding me?

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:01.962
That man is number three on my speed dial.

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:05.848
Okay, that'll work.

01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:08.340
- And Steven?
- Yes?

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:10.408
Don't call me honey.

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:12.284
I love you, too.

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.369
Let's set up right here.

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:33.481
Where's Bill?

01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:37.860
He had to make a sudden
trip to Pennsylvania.

01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:40.406
- Family emergency.
- Bullshit.

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:41.820
He thinks if he stays away

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:44.287
we won't vote because we have to
vote in a unanimous block.

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:45.845
That's the tradition.

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:50.220
Dane Wells is prepared to
tell the press that some of us

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.846
are getting multiple pensions.

01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:56.201
How does he know that?

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.020
I told him.

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:02.282
Why, is it a secret?

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:05.260
No, it's not a secret.

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.900
You know, Dane Wells,
can go screw himself.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.420
I do two jobs for the county,
I'll get two pensions, big deal.

01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:12.340
It's legal, and it's common.

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:14.100
Imagine the headlines.

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:17.340
Freeholders get several pensions
while dying cop gets none.

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.900
We'll look like idiots
if we change our minds now!

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.460
We'll look like we cave!

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:23.180
That's what you do
when your ass is against the wall!

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.820
- You cave!
- If Bill's absent, we can't vote.

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:27.420
The board of freeholders
doesn't reverse itself.

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:28.620
That's all there is to it.

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:30.210
Besides, if Bill's absent, we can't vote.

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:31.300
We need to cancel the meeting.

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:34.563
We are not canceling the meeting!

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:37.000
That's the governor.

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:40.090
Governor's got no authority
over county officials.

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.164
Governor!

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.500
What's going on out there?

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:53.763
You know, the freeholder meeting
about that lesbian's pension.

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:05.180
Where you going?

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:06.770
Going down to that freeholder meeting.

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:14.300
I'm gonna show my support
for another gay cop.

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:17.961
Does anybody have anything
they want to say about that?

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.604
How about you, Toohey?

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:40.740
I'm going in my office
and I'm closing the door,

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:44.401
and if anybody wants to
duck out, for any reason,

01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:47.448
I won't notice.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.000
You have the power!

01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:57.685
'Bout time.

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:18.820
Ladies and gentlemen,
please, please, please.

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:22.481
Now, we've called this meeting today to...

01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:53.220
We're here today to address
the issue of extending

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:56.660
domestic partnership
benefits to county employees.

01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:00.242
So if anyone wishes to make a comment,
now would be a good time.

01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:22.204
I just wanted to let you know...
that time is of the essence.

01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:27.849
All I'm asking is that you make change.

01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:35.569
You okay?

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.049
I hate speaking in public.

01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:04.167
I really hate it.

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:09.100
And I never really cared about
this whole pension thing,

01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:14.684
I never understood why is
was so important to Laurel.

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:19.527
But now I think I get it.

01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:25.540
We're just average people.

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:32.330
We have a house
and a dog and we pay our taxes.

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:36.660
We're not perfect, I mean,
we have our differences

01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:38.980
and our disagreements.

01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:43.404
I love motorcycles and she hates them.

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:48.210
Our house isn't fancy.

01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:51.300
But it was a labor of love.

01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.820
You know, working on it and renovating it

01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:58.620
and Laurel put a lot of thought
into every detail, you know,

01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:02.820
the light fixtures and the tile.

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:09.700
And... we worked so hard on it

01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:13.441
'cause we thought we were
gonna live in it forever.

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:20.729
But I guess that's not gonna happen.

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:28.740
So the house, well, I'd just
really like to hold on to it,

01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:31.446
you know, to remember...

01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:36.771
to remember how much we love each other.

01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:41.290
Thank you.

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:45.284
Thank you.

01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:05.060
On the motion of extending
domestic partnership benefits

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:09.848
to county employees,
Freeholder Kelder how do you vote?

01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:13.084
Yes.

01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:16.164
Freeholder Wickery?

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:19.922
Freeholder Wickery?

01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:25.885
Yes.

01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:29.927
Freeholder Santucci?

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:34.885
Thanks for hanging me out to dry.

01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:39.769
I vote yes.

01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:46.041
It's unanimous, the motion has passed!

01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:48.689
I love you guys!

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:53.020
I love you! Thank you, thank you!

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:55.327
For opening your hearts!

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:50.380
Hey, Laurel.

01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:52.740
How you doing, chief?

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:56.500
We got a conviction against the men
who killed Tommy and Debbie Cherico.

01:29:56.600 --> 01:30:00.127
Put 'em away for life, thanks to you.

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:02.420
And we're pleased to inform you

01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:05.020
that you've been promoted
to the rank of lieutenant

01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:06.929
in the Ocean County Police Department.

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:22.687
Congratulations.

01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:25.563
Thanks, chief.

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:29.487
Congratulations, partner.

01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:48.089
Let me see.

01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:54.761
Will you marry me?

01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:11.049
I love you.

01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:14.407
I love you.

01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:19.207
I love you.

01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:58.129
Present, huh!

01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:03.805
Order, huh!

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:07.450
About face.

01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:32.130
Come and get it.
