00:02.877 --> 00:07.173
Attention, everyone. This meeting
of the Reptile Club will come to order.

00:09.134 --> 00:11.803
Uh, Ravi? We need to talk.

00:13.388 --> 00:17.100
Can it wait? Glenda the Gecko
is about to go over the minutes.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.603
Ever since
the school Reptile Club disbanded,

00:20.687 --> 00:22.564
you've been acting a little strange.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.358
It did not disband.

00:25.442 --> 00:26.901
The principal shut us down

00:26.985 --> 00:30.113
for losing an unacceptable number
of snakes in the library.

00:30.196 --> 00:31.489
One is unacceptable.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.199
Ew! What's that?

00:33.283 --> 00:36.953
Oh! Mrs. Kipling was kind enough
to bring the refreshments.

00:38.079 --> 00:40.707
They are cute and nutritious.

00:41.541 --> 00:45.003
Mmm. Please tell me you're not gonna try
one of those on a cracker.

00:45.879 --> 00:50.508
Okay, look, Ravi, I think it's time
you made some new friends.

00:50.592 --> 00:54.471
You know,
ones that are warm-blooded and alive.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.599
That is what the principal said.

00:57.682 --> 01:00.352
Right before he screamed
for the anti-venom.

01:01.353 --> 01:02.687
Good thing I always pack that
in your lunch.

01:04.022 --> 01:07.192
Anyway, I found this group you might like.
It's called The Intelligentsia Club.

01:07.275 --> 01:09.110
Oh, I know what Intelligentsia is.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.862
A group for people with genius IQs,

01:10.945 --> 01:13.114
who do not wish to associate
with numbskulls.

01:13.698 --> 01:16.409
Hey, just because someone isn't a genius
doesn't make them a numbskull.

01:16.493 --> 01:19.204
Actually, according to theories
of phrenology,

01:19.287 --> 01:23.958
diminished cranial sensitivity
is directly related to stupidity.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.920
Yeah, you're gonna fit right in.

Hey, Bertram!

02:26.730 --> 02:30.400
I've, uh, got some fun plans today,
if you're looking for something to do.

02:30.483 --> 02:35.238
I'm not. To me, doing something is
a distant second to doing nothing.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.950
There's a collectible show in the park.

02:39.034 --> 02:41.119
I've been looking for
a Mickey Mantle rookie card,

02:41.202 --> 02:43.747
and I bet they'll have
lots of other cool stuff too.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.124
Ooh! You think they'll have cuckoo clocks?

02:46.708 --> 02:50.045
Uh, would it be a collectibles show
if they didn't?

02:50.628 --> 02:52.922
Good point.
I'll go get my collecting gloves.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.841
Oh, you mean
the ones with the orange stains?

02:54.924 --> 02:57.010
Sometimes I collect cheese puffs.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.475
Hey, Emma.
Oh, you left your wallet at home.

03:03.558 --> 03:06.603
-Oh.
-Wow, that's a fancy ring to wear to work.

03:06.686 --> 03:10.023
Oh, this old thing?
It's just my burger-flipping diamond.

03:10.857 --> 03:15.945
Jessie, look! It is
the international crossword puzzle champ!

03:16.029 --> 03:19.074
You did not tell me
there would be celebrities here!

03:20.075 --> 03:21.451
That's because there aren't.

03:22.494 --> 03:26.373
Wow. Crossword puzzles
aren't the only thing filled with squares.

03:27.707 --> 03:30.585
Hey, did I hear you guys talking
about crosswords?

03:30.669 --> 03:32.796
I was front row
at that championship match.

03:32.879 --> 03:37.175
Lucky! I had to listen to it
on Wide World of Nerds.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.636
Wasn't it amazing when he won

03:39.719 --> 03:42.180
with that four-letter word
for a Middle Eastern goat?

03:42.263 --> 03:43.556
Ibex!

03:44.557 --> 03:45.892
Which school do you attend?

03:45.975 --> 03:48.895
NYU Medical.
I'm specializing in Psychiatry.

03:49.688 --> 03:52.023
So you are the world's youngest Jungian?

03:52.107 --> 03:53.775
I'm a-Freud I am.

03:57.445 --> 03:58.446
Wow!

03:59.823 --> 04:03.118
Well, I'll let you two get your geek on.

04:03.451 --> 04:04.953
I'll pick you up at 3:00.

04:06.121 --> 04:07.956
-Oh, hi.
-Oh, hi.

04:08.039 --> 04:10.500
I'm Scott. Are you here
for the Intelligentsia meeting?

04:10.583 --> 04:14.129
You betcha! I mean, indubitably.

04:14.879 --> 04:16.673
So, what's your IQ?

04:16.756 --> 04:19.092
Or should I wait to ask you that
on our first date?

04:19.175 --> 04:20.802
Are we going on a date?

04:20.885 --> 04:24.055
Is any fraction with zero
as its denominator undefined?

04:25.390 --> 04:26.808
-Yes?
-Great.

04:26.891 --> 04:28.601
- Good.
- How about tonight?

04:29.185 --> 04:32.981
Sure. Yeah. I can always
translate The Odyssey into Greek tomorrow.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.816
Uh, the original is in Greek.

04:35.400 --> 04:39.404
I knew that. I was just testing you. Pass!

04:43.366 --> 04:44.993
Madeline, welcome.

04:45.076 --> 04:47.287
I am so happy Ravi made a friend.

04:47.370 --> 04:50.540
I mean, so happy. So, so, so...

04:50.623 --> 04:54.502
Okay, Jessie! I think we are good.

04:55.962 --> 04:59.090
Will you be joining us
for a round of Advanced Aztec Trivia?

04:59.174 --> 05:01.634
Gee, I wish I could.

05:02.802 --> 05:05.180
But I've got to go find an outfit
and double my IQ

05:05.263 --> 05:06.890
before my date with Buff 'N Brainy.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.729
Oh, Zuri, meet Madeline, my new friend.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.314
New friend?

05:14.397 --> 05:17.400
Whatever Jessie is paying you,
she should double it.

05:18.276 --> 05:21.571
Do you not have some inane country music
to listen to?

05:23.073 --> 05:24.991
You're a country fan? Me too!

05:25.075 --> 05:27.994
Next to Power Ponies,
it's my favorite thing ever.

05:28.078 --> 05:29.579
I love Power Ponies!

05:32.374 --> 05:34.167
What is happening?

05:35.335 --> 05:38.421
Wanna watch Power Ponies Season 3
with bloopers?

05:38.505 --> 05:40.382
Stardust keeps forgetting her lines.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.093
Uh, hello?

05:43.176 --> 05:46.262
Madeline and I were about to
go over calculus flashcards.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.973
Don't you think she's a little too young
to be your friend?

05:49.057 --> 05:51.559
No. She is my intellectual equal!

05:51.643 --> 05:56.314
And I am sure she'll prefer higher math
to a mind-numbing spree of equine comedy.

05:57.190 --> 06:01.027
Ravi, I do love those formulas,
but I'm also a card-carrying Pony Pal.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.529
Be right back. Promise.

06:03.488 --> 06:06.408
I rue the day
those ponies received their powers

06:06.491 --> 06:08.284
from the magical rainbow crystal.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.829
Curses! I've become what I despise!

06:16.334 --> 06:21.047
Hey, this is all sports stuff.
You know I hate sports!

06:21.131 --> 06:23.717
I'm sure we can find you
something you like here.

06:24.009 --> 06:25.468
You collect everything.

06:25.552 --> 06:28.388
That's not true. I'm very selective.

06:28.471 --> 06:31.391
You need a snowplow to get to your bed.

06:31.891 --> 06:35.603
Yeah, luckily, I've got one in my closet.
Just can't get to it.

06:37.147 --> 06:39.899
Look, Bertram,
I just want you to have a good time, okay?

06:39.983 --> 06:41.609
That's why I brought you here.

06:41.693 --> 06:46.114
Or is it because of that sign that says,
"Minors must be accompanied by an adult"?

06:47.073 --> 06:48.366
What?

06:49.826 --> 06:54.247
I did not read that on the website at all.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.878
It was kind of you to placate Zuri.

06:59.961 --> 07:03.673
It must have been tiresome
to sit through that animated swill.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.759
Actually, I really like Power Ponies.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.552
Zuri has cooties.

07:10.221 --> 07:14.059
Anyhoo, first trivia question.

07:14.142 --> 07:16.102
-This reptilian snake...
-Quetzalcoatl.

07:16.186 --> 07:19.022
Correct. And now some hard ones.

07:20.148 --> 07:21.775
Oh, hey, I'm Emma.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.193
Oh, hi!

07:23.276 --> 07:26.237
You're that pretty girl
who wore that gorgeous ring to work today.

07:26.321 --> 07:28.740
-Aww.
-Back off. She is my friend.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.994
I will get some more
challenging questions.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.746
I could answer these
when I was in Pull-Ups.

07:34.829 --> 07:37.582
Please, do not tell her
how recent that was.

07:39.542 --> 07:42.212
That's a beautiful necklace
you're wearing.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.507
Oh, this is just
my reality show-watching ruby.

07:45.590 --> 07:48.051
You should see the diamond I wear
for awards shows.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.345
It weighs more than Ravi.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.307
Ooh, I'd love to see that!

07:54.391 --> 07:55.934
Okay, BRB with the bling.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.652
Hey, everything's going great.

08:05.735 --> 08:08.238
The nanny's gone,
and the kids are right where we want them.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.740
We're gonna clean out this cushy crib.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.210
I'm bored. I wanna go home.

08:22.293 --> 08:25.130
Okay, I'm sure we can find you something.

08:25.922 --> 08:30.176
Hey, Bertram, look.
A wrestling belt!

08:30.260 --> 08:31.636
You like wrestling, right?

08:31.720 --> 08:33.722
Don't like that. It's stupid.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.684
Fine, let's just move on.

08:37.767 --> 08:41.021
Ow! You're mean!

08:44.774 --> 08:46.818
He gets like this
when he hasn't had his nap.

08:48.194 --> 08:52.032
Okay, if I get you cotton candy,
will you please behave?

08:52.115 --> 08:53.658
Only if it's blue.

09:03.585 --> 09:06.212
Ooh, that one must have cost a fortune!

09:06.296 --> 09:08.590
Yep. Almost a whole week's allowance.

09:09.924 --> 09:12.510
-Emma, you stole my friend!
-Did not!

09:12.594 --> 09:15.555
The irony here is that
you both stole her from me!

09:15.638 --> 09:18.266
More like saved her from death by boredom.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.561
Guys, don't fight!

09:21.644 --> 09:23.188
Look, I have an idea.

09:23.271 --> 09:27.317
In my psychiatric research,
I discovered a new type of family therapy.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.152
It's rather intense, but it works.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.403
It's called...

09:32.822 --> 09:34.240
Handcuff Therapy.

09:35.241 --> 09:38.536
Unless those are sterling silver,
they're not going on my wrists.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.873
I'm telling you, this is very effective.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.084
Now, everyone, sit down
with your backs to each other.

09:44.167 --> 09:45.752
-Why?
-Just trust me.

09:45.835 --> 09:49.255
No, I trust you, but the last time
I turned my back on Zuri,

09:49.339 --> 09:52.217
she affixed a "Kick Me" placard
to my posterior.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.887
Did not! I stuck it on your butt.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.473
See? You guys need this.

09:58.556 --> 10:02.102
Studies find when you connect yourself
with someone physically,

10:02.185 --> 10:06.231
you feel more connected emotionally,
and are forced to resolve conflict.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.441
Does this really solve problems?

10:11.778 --> 10:14.823
It's gonna solve my cash flow problem.

10:18.201 --> 10:19.369
I don't understand.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.497
I'm robbing you.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.585
Is this part of the therapy?

10:29.796 --> 10:33.508
How do you even dress yourself?
She conned us!

10:34.968 --> 10:36.720
Madeline, I thought we were friends.

10:36.803 --> 10:41.099
We had so much in common.
The crossword champ, the astrolabes...

10:41.182 --> 10:44.102
I flashed my cards for you!

10:45.145 --> 10:48.106
Sorry, nerd, it's just business.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.030
So do you only go out
with fellow geniuses,

10:55.113 --> 10:57.115
or do you date outside of your percentile?

10:57.198 --> 10:59.701
Oh, I date all kinds of guys.

10:59.784 --> 11:03.663
Yeah, smart ones, dumb ones.
Lots of dumb ones.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.791
They must've been fools
if they let you go.

11:06.875 --> 11:10.295
Oh! Scott, that's so sweet!

11:10.378 --> 11:11.671
Do you have any flaws?

11:11.755 --> 11:14.549
I mean, cologne abuse,
unbearable karaoke choices,

11:14.632 --> 11:17.010
shared custody of a hamster with your ex?

11:18.053 --> 11:19.804
No. Who does those things?

11:20.263 --> 11:21.306
No one I've dated.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.642
Come on, you must have some flaw.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.103
Not really. I'm just a normal guy.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.897
Spider!

11:30.315 --> 11:31.441
And there it is.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.652
Sorry, it's just that I have
a little phobia when it comes to...

11:34.736 --> 11:36.738
OMG, it's on the pizza!

11:38.782 --> 11:39.949
That's a mushroom.

11:40.950 --> 11:45.622
Okay, okay, but just in case,
could you please put your napkin over it?

11:46.581 --> 11:48.249
You know, I think this is the time

11:48.333 --> 11:50.835
when I usually go to the bathroom
and never come back.

11:50.919 --> 11:54.422
Wait, stay! I'll be fine, I promi...

11:54.506 --> 11:57.300
Did you see that? The napkin moved!

11:58.843 --> 11:59.886
Okay, we're done here.

12:01.304 --> 12:03.473
-No, wait!
-No, thank you!

12:10.563 --> 12:14.943
Okay, now can we go look
at the baseball cards?

12:15.026 --> 12:17.112
Right after we get a banana shake.

12:17.696 --> 12:20.490
No! You've already had cotton candy,

12:20.573 --> 12:23.535
a balloon,
and you got to be a big, scary tiger.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.789
Now it's time to do what I want!

12:27.872 --> 12:31.668
Forget it. You only used me
because you needed an adult.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.628
I want a 'nana shake!

12:33.712 --> 12:37.257
I want a 'nana shake!
I want a 'nana shake!

12:39.134 --> 12:41.011
Okay, I give up!

12:41.720 --> 12:44.848
I've been looking for this
Mickey Mantle rookie card for years.

12:45.015 --> 12:48.768
And I thought you, as a collector,
would understand how important that was.

12:49.144 --> 12:53.148
But since you're not having fun,
let's just go home.

12:54.983 --> 12:58.028
Fine. I guess we can
go look for your card.

12:59.070 --> 13:01.197
But you're not gonna find
any bargains here.

13:01.281 --> 13:05.452
Let me guess, all the good deals
are by the pony rides?

13:06.661 --> 13:10.415
No. I'm only telling you
to avoid the tables up front.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.042
These guys are pros.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.210
All their stuff is way overpriced.

13:15.170 --> 13:16.838
Well, it is. Just own it.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.675
So where am I supposed to look?

13:20.759 --> 13:22.010
In the back.

13:22.093 --> 13:24.304
You want a disorganized table
manned by someone

13:24.387 --> 13:27.057
who doesn't know or care
what they have for sale.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.309
They just wanna unload it and go home.

13:29.392 --> 13:31.644
But I can't dig through all that stuff
by myself.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.146
It would take forever.

13:34.064 --> 13:35.398
Let's do this.

13:35.899 --> 13:38.568
Oh, thanks, Bertram! Hey, up top!

13:38.651 --> 13:40.528
Not until I get my 'nana shake.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.118
Jessie, help!

13:47.202 --> 13:49.913
Guys, I told you,
when Luke gets out his magic kit,

13:49.996 --> 13:51.414
just leave the room.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.669
-It wasn't Luke.
-It was Madeline! She's a thief!

13:56.753 --> 14:00.006
Hey, Nanny McDweeb, you're back early.

14:01.758 --> 14:05.470
Wait! You're a thief?
I thought you were a tiny psychiatrist.

14:06.638 --> 14:09.391
If you cannot trust a strange kid
you pick up in the park,

14:09.474 --> 14:10.558
who can you trust?

14:11.726 --> 14:12.894
Jessie!

14:12.977 --> 14:15.355
Scott, I already told you it's over.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.273
But before you leave,
could you please call the police

14:17.357 --> 14:19.359
and tell them this horrible little girl is
robbing us?

14:19.442 --> 14:21.861
Oh, that horrible little girl is
my sister.

14:21.945 --> 14:23.196
What? No!

14:23.279 --> 14:25.031
I work with her.

14:25.115 --> 14:27.033
-For her!
-Oh!

14:27.909 --> 14:29.744
And that's for calling me horrible!

14:29.828 --> 14:32.205
-Jessie started it!
-Wait! No! Okay.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.541
Ow!

14:34.624 --> 14:36.334
Wait, so you lied to me,

14:36.418 --> 14:38.503
took my family hostage,
and now you're robbing us?

14:38.586 --> 14:39.587
Kind of.

14:41.297 --> 14:42.799
Still not my worst date.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.931
When I asked you if you had any flaws,

14:50.015 --> 14:52.350
why didn't you mention
that you're a liar and a thief?

14:52.851 --> 14:54.769
Duh, because I'm a liar and a thief.

14:56.021 --> 14:58.732
Cram it, Scott!
Get upstairs and grab the heavy stuff.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.775
Can you try not to mess that up?

15:01.443 --> 15:03.653
Please don't yell at me
in front of the captives!

15:04.571 --> 15:06.781
I am so telling Mom
how you almost blew this.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.366
You're off the Vegas job!

15:09.659 --> 15:11.119
I love Vegas!

15:13.288 --> 15:15.081
Okay, we're gonna push our backs together,

15:15.165 --> 15:17.751
stand up, and move across to the elevator.
Ready? Go!

15:19.919 --> 15:22.589
Okay, come on! Use your cores!

15:23.214 --> 15:26.968
- I have no core!
- Leave me! Save yourselves!

15:27.052 --> 15:29.220
Don't you think we would if we could?

15:30.930 --> 15:33.433
Okay, Plan B.
We butt-scoot across the floor.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.352
Ready? Go!

15:35.435 --> 15:39.773
Ow! Someone scooted on my hand!
I think it is broken.

15:39.856 --> 15:43.693
It's not our fault you have the bones
of a 95-year-old woman.

15:44.402 --> 15:45.737
Drink some milk!

15:46.696 --> 15:49.491
Zuri, slow down, you're pulling my wrist!

15:49.574 --> 15:52.118
And it's turning green
from these cheap cuffs.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.747
Wow, you guys act like you've never been
handcuffed and robbed before!

15:56.831 --> 16:00.293
What? The drill team state championship
was in a very dodgy part of Houston.

16:03.672 --> 16:07.884
A mint condition Mickey Mantle rookie card
for 50 bucks!

16:07.967 --> 16:09.094
This is awesome!

16:09.177 --> 16:13.223
All because a guy left his bitter ex-wife
three storage units to clean out.

16:15.433 --> 16:20.021
Hey, uh, I'm sorry I tricked you, Bertram.
Today was actually really cool.

16:20.105 --> 16:24.901
Hanging out as friends,
instead of, you know, master and servant.

16:25.443 --> 16:26.945
How kind of you, sire.

16:28.530 --> 16:29.989
I had fun too.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.701
Teaching a child how to sift
through the possessions

16:32.784 --> 16:36.621
of a co-dependent feuding couple,
it's what life's all about.

16:39.124 --> 16:42.377
Oh, uh, by the way, I got you
a little something.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.713
What?

16:44.796 --> 16:46.840
A cuckoo clock? You found one!

16:46.923 --> 16:50.176
Yeah. It's a Derek Jeter
limited edition cuckoo clock.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.887
They're very rare. And very weird.

16:52.971 --> 16:54.931
Jeter! Jeter! Jeter!

16:55.015 --> 16:57.726
I love it! Thank you, Luke.

16:57.809 --> 17:00.270
Aww!

17:00.353 --> 17:01.896
Let's never speak of this again.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.398
Wasn't planning to.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.736
Guys, we gotta sync up our tushes.

17:07.819 --> 17:11.031
Ready? Scoot! Scoot! Shoot!

17:11.906 --> 17:13.658
Where do you guys think you're going?

17:13.742 --> 17:16.494
Nowhere! Just taking a little scoot
around the room.

17:16.578 --> 17:18.830
Captivity is no reason to quit exercising.

17:19.622 --> 17:22.000
Tell that to the chunky lizard upstairs.

17:22.083 --> 17:26.463
Mrs. Kipling is not chunky.
She is just big scaled!

17:28.006 --> 17:30.383
Dude, get some human friends.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.888
I was trying to! With you!

17:35.388 --> 17:37.390
And how's that working out for you?

17:40.143 --> 17:41.936
How did you meet that Madeline anyway?

17:42.020 --> 17:46.358
At a mixer Jessie forced me to attend.
Another epic nanny fail.

17:46.441 --> 17:47.942
Uh, I'm right here!

17:48.693 --> 17:50.653
So this was all Jessie's fault?

17:50.737 --> 17:52.113
What else is new?

17:52.572 --> 17:54.949
Okay, that's it. I've had enough!

17:55.033 --> 17:58.328
The entire Ross family has treated me
like garbage for years.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.623
You should've seen how we treated
nannies one through ten.

18:02.957 --> 18:04.668
I work seven days a week

18:04.751 --> 18:08.797
making sure four incredibly spoiled kids
don't rip each other apart,

18:08.880 --> 18:12.092
I get paid bupkis, and no one ever bothers
to say, "Thank you!"

18:12.175 --> 18:14.052
Thank you?

18:15.804 --> 18:18.807
Now you guys have the nerve
to blame me for what's happening here?

18:18.890 --> 18:20.225
It's payback time.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.311
Guys, I wanna join your team.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.063
What the what?

18:26.106 --> 18:28.108
I can give you all their credit cards,
PIN-numbers,

18:28.191 --> 18:29.943
and the combination to the safe

18:30.026 --> 18:32.696
hidden behind that obnoxious
family portrait in the master bedroom.

18:33.279 --> 18:36.658
You said our matching Christmas sweaters
were adorable!

18:37.325 --> 18:38.368
I lied.

18:38.952 --> 18:42.664
The combination is 0-3-24-01.

18:42.747 --> 18:45.500
Ooh, those numbers are my birthday.

18:45.583 --> 18:48.336
I guess we know
who Mrs. Mommy's favorite is.

18:50.922 --> 18:53.008
And there's a lot more stuff
hidden around here.

18:53.091 --> 18:55.051
Let me go,
and we can split the haul three ways.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.219
Sounds good to me!

18:56.302 --> 18:57.512
Me too!

18:57.595 --> 19:00.098
You're cold, vicious, and heartless.

19:00.181 --> 19:02.308
You're the big sister I always wanted.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.897
Hey guys, we found some amazing stuff.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.524
-It's worth a fortune.
-Yeah.

19:09.607 --> 19:12.193
Great! Wanna see a trick?

19:12.277 --> 19:14.612
-She's gone rogue! Call the cops!
-No, call the cops! She's robbing us!

19:14.696 --> 19:16.364
Guys, keep it down!

19:16.823 --> 19:18.450
Jessie's gonna show me a trick.

19:20.285 --> 19:22.871
Hey! No!
My Mickey Mantle card is in there!

19:22.954 --> 19:25.707
Don't take my cuckoo clock!

19:25.790 --> 19:28.835
The big one's really annoying.
No wonder she wants out.

19:30.211 --> 19:31.880
Mom is gonna love you.

19:33.631 --> 19:36.051
All right, let's lock these guys out
on the terrace

19:36.134 --> 19:37.594
so they don't get any bright ideas.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.555
I begged your parents
to screen her more carefully.

19:46.061 --> 19:47.479
Come on, go over there.

19:47.562 --> 19:48.772
Yeah. Oh, oh.

19:49.689 --> 19:50.899
Do you have a plan?

19:50.982 --> 19:53.109
No, I just wanna sit. Ah.

19:54.152 --> 19:56.071
I can't believe
Jessie really turned on us.

19:56.154 --> 19:57.447
Oh, she's gotta be faking it.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.157
If she's that good at faking it,

19:59.240 --> 20:01.409
seems like she would book
more acting jobs.

20:02.035 --> 20:05.372
Luke is right.
Our beloved Jessie would never betray us.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.250
That traitorous she-devil!

20:09.626 --> 20:11.753
You could knock me over with a feather.

20:11.836 --> 20:13.797
-We know.
-We have.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.175
Told you guys I'd hook you up.

20:17.258 --> 20:18.426
And you did.

20:18.510 --> 20:22.305
Sorry I pegged you for a goody two shoes,
old maid, brat-tamer.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.433
She's not that old.

20:26.434 --> 20:29.729
You guys must have been voted
most popular kids in reform school.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.565
He should have been voted the laziest.

20:32.649 --> 20:35.944
Would it have killed you
to pick up a flat screen or two?

20:38.738 --> 20:40.740
Hey, Scott's doing his best.

20:40.824 --> 20:43.785
Which is why I picked up something
especially for him.

20:43.868 --> 20:45.412
-You did?
-Yeah.

20:45.495 --> 20:48.707
Spiders! Get them away from me!

20:48.790 --> 20:50.208
Not until the cops come!

20:50.291 --> 20:52.377
Get off me, you big dummy!

20:54.713 --> 20:59.592
I am so embarrassed to be related to you.

21:01.428 --> 21:04.973
Who could have predicted Jessie would
turn out to be so treacherous?

21:05.557 --> 21:07.058
I should have seen it coming.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.728
All those times she shut me down
when I hit on her.

21:10.228 --> 21:13.356
When we get married,
that's gonna get really annoying.

21:14.941 --> 21:18.570
You're still hanging on to that?
She just chained us up and robbed us!

21:18.653 --> 21:20.071
I wish she had cut me in.

21:21.573 --> 21:23.158
I mean, shame on her!

21:24.451 --> 21:26.536
Worst nanny ever.

21:27.579 --> 21:29.247
Guys, it's all over!

21:29.330 --> 21:32.542
The night doorman called the cops,
and they detained those creeps downstairs.

21:32.625 --> 21:33.668
They did?

21:33.752 --> 21:35.962
Yeah, it was so easy for me to trick them.

21:36.046 --> 21:39.090
Can you believe they bought that garbage
about me turning on you guys?

21:39.174 --> 21:41.176
-No.
-No way!

21:42.635 --> 21:44.387
You all thought I turned on you,
didn't you?

21:45.513 --> 21:47.390
Like a pit bull with mood swings.

21:49.851 --> 21:51.519
I had fun tonight, Jessie.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.981
Yeah, we should do this again
in three to five.

21:56.524 --> 21:58.860
Oh, uh, Madeline, I forgive you,

21:58.943 --> 22:02.739
so let us be the best of pen pals
while you are at the reformatory.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.742
Uh, that's okay. Don't go to any trouble.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.702
Oh! No trouble at all.

22:07.786 --> 22:10.747
You may be a felon,
but you can still be my BFF.

22:11.247 --> 22:16.002
Oh, thanks, but I'll probably mouth off
and get my mail privileges revoked.

22:16.086 --> 22:19.130
-Then we shall video chat and you can...
-No, we shall not!

22:20.590 --> 22:22.759
OMG, kid, take a hint.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.179
I've gotta find less needy marks.

22:27.138 --> 22:30.725
Oh, Ravi, don't be sad.
You'll make another friend.

22:30.809 --> 22:33.061
One you won't have to get a pat-down
to visit.

22:33.687 --> 22:36.523
And in the meantime,
I'll be your trivia partner.

22:36.606 --> 22:38.191
Oh! Fantastic!

22:38.274 --> 22:40.110
Let us start with something easy.

22:40.193 --> 22:44.280
Early Druid mythology,
or Jurassic crustaceans?

22:45.281 --> 22:48.201
Oh, you, you keep those on you? Great!

22:50.870 --> 22:53.164
Oops! Did I forget to put that back?

22:54.332 --> 22:55.959
Oh, I just wanted to wear it to the deli.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.253
The guy who makes the egg salad is
so cute.
