03:53.507 --> 03:55.969
- Where's my 300 quid?

04:02.417 --> 04:03.317
Glove box.

04:09.391 --> 04:12.491
- It's empty.
- Bullets are in there.

04:13.626 --> 04:17.463
- There's only three.
- How many do you need?

04:23.031 --> 04:23.931
- How far?

04:25.099 --> 04:25.999
- Not far.

04:27.937 --> 04:30.641
I bet you've confused
a few people, ain't ya,

04:30.643 --> 04:33.446
coming back after 10 years?

04:33.448 --> 04:34.876
Where've you been?

04:36.484 --> 04:37.648
- Hell.

04:39.388 --> 04:41.685
- Tell me about it.

04:55.470 --> 04:57.503
- That's it.

05:20.825 --> 05:22.726
- Oh, fuck's sake.

05:22.728 --> 05:24.761
Are you fuckin' serious?

05:27.931 --> 05:29.634
Shit.

05:29.636 --> 05:31.867
What?
- Drive, don't worry!

06:46.482 --> 06:48.515
- Mate, you've gotta go.

06:49.617 --> 06:50.979
- The best night.

06:54.215 --> 06:56.215
When I grow up,

06:56.217 --> 07:01.462
I am definitely gonna
work at the fair, 180%.

07:10.231 --> 07:11.736
Things to do, my friend.

07:28.084 --> 07:30.183
- Ollie?

07:32.924 --> 07:34.825
Ollie, it's00.

07:36.290 --> 07:37.861
Are you coming to bed?

07:39.601 --> 07:40.765
Oh! Oh, Ollie!

07:41.966 --> 07:43.768
Fuck! Fuckin' hell!

07:43.770 --> 07:46.936
Ollie! Ollie--
- Hello, Cheryl.

07:48.236 --> 07:49.708
Long time, no see.

07:52.075 --> 07:53.140
Where's Gemma?

07:57.311 --> 07:59.784
- What are you doin' here, Bull?

08:03.856 --> 08:07.022
- Where is she?
- What? I haven't seen her!

08:07.024 --> 08:08.991
I haven't seen any of them!

08:11.930 --> 08:15.327
Oh, god!

08:15.329 --> 08:19.265
Oh, god!

08:27.946 --> 08:28.846
Ollie!

08:30.784 --> 08:32.311
- Tell me what happened to
Aiden.

08:33.952 --> 08:36.920
- I don't know! It's been years!

08:36.922 --> 08:40.660
- Norm, he knows.

08:40.662 --> 08:41.859
Your family, they know.

08:43.192 --> 08:44.697
- No one talks to me.

08:46.030 --> 08:46.930
I swear!

08:48.197 --> 08:50.230
Please, Bull, come on.

08:50.232 --> 08:51.605
Bull, get off!

08:54.005 --> 08:57.875
- Aiden!

08:57.877 --> 08:59.239
- I'm sorry.

08:59.241 --> 09:02.682
Ow! Fuck!

09:04.048 --> 09:06.686
You're not right,
Bull.

09:07.953 --> 09:10.921
You're evil. There's
something wrong with you.

09:13.057 --> 09:15.288
- You have no idea.

09:15.290 --> 09:15.955
- Bull!

09:39.886 --> 09:42.018
- Hello.
- Gary, it's Jim.

09:42.020 --> 09:45.351
- Alright, mate. You okay?
- No, not really, mate.

09:45.353 --> 09:47.287
It's Ollie and Cheryl, mate,
they're dead.

09:47.289 --> 09:49.256
- What?
- They've been killed.

09:49.258 --> 09:50.829
- How?
- Butchered.

09:55.330 --> 09:56.462
- Have you called Norm?

09:56.464 --> 09:59.805
- No, I ain't gonna
tell him, you'll have to.

09:59.807 --> 10:02.005
Can you go around?
- Yeah.

10:02.007 --> 10:05.437
Yeah, yeah, I can go around,
yeah.

10:09.615 --> 10:12.015
Want me to drive down after?

10:12.017 --> 10:13.720
- No, what are you gonna
do?

10:13.722 --> 10:17.889
Look, just do me a favor,
just tell Norm, alright?

10:18.991 --> 10:21.024
- She was never
mixed up in anything,

10:21.026 --> 10:22.927
never involved.

10:22.929 --> 10:25.391
- You don't know what
happened yet.

10:25.393 --> 10:27.096
Could be a robbery.

10:27.098 --> 10:28.031
Could be anything.

10:29.837 --> 10:30.702
Ta.

10:30.704 --> 10:32.398
- She should never have moved
away.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.301
If she was still here, we
could have protected her.

10:34.303 --> 10:35.940
- Protect her from what?

10:37.273 --> 10:39.845
You just said she was
never mixed up in anything.

10:41.816 --> 10:43.046
She made her own choices.

10:43.950 --> 10:44.916
It was their problem.

10:44.918 --> 10:46.951
- Oi, you watch what you're
saying, Gary.

10:46.953 --> 10:48.447
It's my blood that was spilled.

10:51.023 --> 10:52.121
You don't have to be doing
something wrong

10:52.123 --> 10:53.122
to need protectin'.

10:56.358 --> 11:00.327
In here!

11:05.741 --> 11:06.432
- Is this mine?

11:09.470 --> 11:11.206
Okay, Gary.

11:11.208 --> 11:12.108
Tell me.

11:14.442 --> 11:15.749
- Cheryl's dead, Norm.

11:19.348 --> 11:21.755
- You sure about this?
- Yeah.

11:23.154 --> 11:24.054
And Ollie.

11:25.420 --> 11:28.256
- Don't give a shit about him.
Why?

11:29.490 --> 11:30.896
- She's not above death.

11:34.264 --> 11:36.770
You want me to go down, see what
happened?

11:36.772 --> 11:40.301
- No, I want you to leave us
alone.

11:51.985 --> 11:56.020
- What are you gonna do about
this, eh?

11:56.022 --> 11:58.088
My sister is dead!

11:58.090 --> 11:58.922
Cheryl is dead!

11:58.924 --> 12:01.487
She's fucking dead!

12:01.489 --> 12:02.356
What are you gonna do?

12:02.358 --> 12:04.259
What do we do now?

12:04.261 --> 12:06.998
What are you gonna do about it?

13:01.890 --> 13:03.120
- Adam.
- Yeah?

13:04.321 --> 13:06.893
- You're Marco's boy?
- Yeah.

13:10.162 --> 13:13.460
- Go home and tell your dad
Bull's here.

13:19.303 --> 13:20.203
- Alright.

13:29.346 --> 13:30.543
- Why would he
be at the Youth Centre?

13:30.545 --> 13:32.281
It's been 10 years.

13:32.283 --> 13:34.580
- I don't know.

13:34.582 --> 13:35.581
I'll have to have a look.

13:35.583 --> 13:37.990
- You need to
stay out of it, Marco.

13:37.992 --> 13:39.189
And it can't be Bull,

13:39.191 --> 13:41.422
"He's gone," you said,
unless you're lyin'.

13:41.424 --> 13:43.127
- I wasn't lying.

13:43.129 --> 13:44.128
I don't know what the fuck's
going on.

13:44.130 --> 13:45.998
- It was him, definitely.
- He doesn't know.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.626
He doesn't know what he looks
like.

13:49.333 --> 13:50.662
What are you doing?
- I'm calling Norm.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.301
- To say what?
- To tell him.

13:57.308 --> 14:00.639
Mate, can you turn it
down? I'm on the phone.

14:02.445 --> 14:03.917
- Where are you going?
- Out.

14:03.919 --> 14:05.182
- You are not.
- Why?

14:05.184 --> 14:06.051
- 'Cause I said so.

14:06.053 --> 14:07.118
Go upstairs, Adam!

14:07.120 --> 14:08.020
- Norm?

14:09.452 --> 14:11.188
Listen, Adam says he's seen
Bull.

14:13.456 --> 14:14.356
Mate, if this--

14:16.228 --> 14:17.128
What?

14:18.164 --> 14:19.064
Fuck.

14:21.398 --> 14:24.069
Yeah, mate, I'm goin'
now.

14:25.072 --> 14:27.171
- What?
- It's Ollie and Cheryl,

14:27.173 --> 14:29.437
dead.
- Dead?

14:29.439 --> 14:31.945
What, murdered?
- I don't know. Yes!

14:31.947 --> 14:33.276
- What for?

14:33.278 --> 14:34.211
Where you going with that?

14:34.213 --> 14:36.312
- Listen, just lock the doors.

15:19.060 --> 15:19.960
Bull?

15:25.066 --> 15:26.560
Fuck, I don't understand, Bull.

15:26.562 --> 15:27.726
How can you even be here?

15:27.728 --> 15:29.002
I don't get it.

15:29.004 --> 15:30.267
- Neither do I, Marco.

15:31.369 --> 15:32.434
Neither do I.

15:34.075 --> 15:36.174
If you don't tell me
what happened to Aiden,

15:36.176 --> 15:39.045
I'm gonna make you eat that
little knife you're holding.

15:41.313 --> 15:42.642
- I'm sorry, Bull.

15:42.644 --> 15:45.381
I was just doing what I was
told, mate.

16:06.074 --> 16:08.437
- What's goin' on? Can you come
home?

16:10.375 --> 16:11.275
Marco?

16:12.806 --> 16:13.706
Marco?

16:15.281 --> 16:16.511
- Diane.
- Who is it?

16:19.516 --> 16:21.384
- Careful, Diane.

16:21.386 --> 16:23.353
I know you recognize my voice.

16:23.355 --> 16:24.717
- Bull?
- I told you it was him.

16:24.719 --> 16:25.619
- Shh! Fuckin' shut up!

16:28.063 --> 16:29.392
Where's Marco?

16:29.394 --> 16:32.362
- I need you to
pass on a message for me.

16:32.364 --> 16:33.264
- Bull?

16:35.730 --> 16:38.599
- Norm, Gary, the others.

16:39.767 --> 16:41.668
- Bull, where's Marco?

16:45.080 --> 16:46.508
Bull, where's Marco?

16:46.510 --> 16:50.215
- Diane, tell them I'm
coming.

16:50.217 --> 16:51.579
I'm coming for all of 'em.

16:51.581 --> 16:54.219
- Mum! Mum!

16:54.221 --> 16:57.420
- Just stay in and lock the
door, okay?

16:57.422 --> 16:59.587
And stay in your room!

17:19.609 --> 17:20.509
Oh, no!

17:24.515 --> 17:25.580
No! Oh, fuck!

17:27.617 --> 17:30.783
Oh, no! Please!

18:35.619 --> 18:38.191
- Fuck! Shit!

18:38.193 --> 18:40.457
Come here right now, you fuckin'
brat.

18:40.459 --> 18:42.591
- No! Please, Dad, no!

18:42.593 --> 18:44.263
- You're getting a soakin'!
- No!

18:44.265 --> 18:45.231
- Believe me, you're givin' me

18:45.233 --> 18:46.562
an excuse now.
- Hey, Dad, no.

18:46.564 --> 18:47.630
Dad, no, no!

18:47.632 --> 18:48.464
- There's water on
your back of your neck.

18:48.466 --> 18:50.269
- Dad!
- First time in six months.

18:50.271 --> 18:51.501
- Dad, Dad!
- Bull!

18:51.503 --> 18:52.733
Oh, Bull, stop that.

18:52.735 --> 18:54.207
Come here.
- Shall we get mummy?

18:54.209 --> 18:56.275
- No, no, no, pack it in.
- Dad, no!

18:56.277 --> 18:57.771
- Alright, Bull! Bull!

18:57.773 --> 18:58.970
I said pack it in!

19:00.710 --> 19:03.579
Aiden, go sit with your
nanny and Cheryl, yeah?

19:03.581 --> 19:04.844
And no more water.
- Aww.

19:06.287 --> 19:07.946
- You're a twat, Bull, I'm
soaking wet.

19:08.883 --> 19:09.849
I'm covered in it.

19:11.226 --> 19:13.226
- A bit of water, what's wrong
with you?

19:20.961 --> 19:22.367
What's the matter with you?

19:22.369 --> 19:24.204
- Ah, just watching you piss
about.

19:26.769 --> 19:28.373
- Well, I'm not on show am I?

19:29.310 --> 19:32.542
- You've been muckin' about with
anyone?

19:33.710 --> 19:35.644
- What? Like a woman?
- Have you?

19:37.450 --> 19:40.583
- No. What, Gemma tell you that?

19:40.585 --> 19:43.322
She's a fucking liar.

19:43.324 --> 19:45.225
- She's my daughter before your
wife.

19:47.790 --> 19:49.856
Watch your fuckin' mouth, Son.

19:55.930 --> 19:56.995
- You think I've got the time
and energy

19:56.997 --> 19:58.766
to do anything but look after
her?

19:59.802 --> 20:02.869
No, I'm not muckin' about with
anyone.

20:02.871 --> 20:04.640
- I'm watchin' you, Bull.

20:04.642 --> 20:05.507
- Yeah, he just said that.

20:05.509 --> 20:07.940
- Yeah, well, just behave
yourself.

20:07.942 --> 20:12.978
I don't want her upset.

20:13.981 --> 20:15.453
- She look upset to you?

20:34.408 --> 20:36.474
- Oh yeah, about time.

20:36.476 --> 20:37.838
- You in a rush?

20:37.840 --> 20:39.444
- You ever get stuff from there?

20:39.446 --> 20:40.742
- No, it's muck.

20:40.744 --> 20:42.040
- Not a pizza?
- No.

20:46.849 --> 20:48.618
- Yeah, mate, any garlic
bread?

20:48.620 --> 20:49.619
- Oh, shut up, man.

20:51.689 --> 20:52.622
- It's no good, is it?

20:52.624 --> 20:53.788
- You can always leave this shit

20:53.790 --> 20:55.427
for someone else to look after.

20:55.429 --> 20:57.990
- Hey, remember who you're
talking to.

20:57.992 --> 20:58.859
- Alright, man.

20:58.861 --> 21:00.300
I've been working all day.

21:01.061 --> 21:02.863
- Come on.

21:02.865 --> 21:04.832
Norm will be there waiting for
you.

21:04.834 --> 21:06.636
- Why aren't you coming?

21:06.638 --> 21:09.067
- I'm vegetarian, mate.

22:14.937 --> 22:16.937
- All I'm asking you
to do is sign the contract

22:16.939 --> 22:18.037
and then it's all sorted, yeah?

22:18.039 --> 22:20.479
- I can't sign it. No.

22:21.174 --> 22:23.141
I'll lose everything if I'm
found out.

22:24.144 --> 22:28.014
- Alan, you'll
not be found out, Son.

22:28.016 --> 22:29.488
You continue to work with the
farms

22:29.490 --> 22:30.687
you've already got in the books.

22:30.689 --> 22:32.524
You just accept the animals I
send you,

22:32.526 --> 22:33.789
you send the meat to where I
tell you.

22:33.791 --> 22:35.023
It's a no-brainer.

22:35.025 --> 22:37.122
It's not gonna fuck up anything
you're already involved in,

22:37.124 --> 22:38.794
and you're not gonna be found
out.

22:38.796 --> 22:40.862
Sign it, Alan. Make it legal.

22:40.864 --> 22:43.535
- Anything else, you know
I do things for you, Norm.

22:44.538 --> 22:47.033
But you know, they'd close me
down.

22:47.035 --> 22:48.705
- You right-handed?
- No.

22:54.779 --> 22:56.746
- Now sign that.

22:56.748 --> 22:57.879
Left hand.

23:02.985 --> 23:03.984
- Good boy.

23:03.986 --> 23:06.492
Okay, Alan, from here
on in if a cop is found

23:06.494 --> 23:08.021
within a mile of this place, or
your home,

23:08.023 --> 23:09.660
or wherever you are,
we'll burn this place down

23:09.662 --> 23:11.695
with your staff inside it.

23:11.697 --> 23:12.929
Then we'll move on to your home

23:12.931 --> 23:15.160
and we'll burn it down with
Maureen and the kids in there.

23:15.162 --> 23:17.635
Do you understand?
- Yeah, yeah.

23:17.637 --> 23:18.636
- Good, man.

23:20.541 --> 23:22.035
But you are fuckin' stupid.

23:23.005 --> 23:24.675
You were always gonna sign it.

23:24.677 --> 23:26.809
Why'd you push it this far?

23:26.811 --> 23:29.515
Right.

23:29.517 --> 23:30.615
Take it easy.

23:49.504 --> 23:51.196
- How comes Gary ain't here?

23:53.772 --> 23:55.541
He getting special treatment
then?

24:30.644 --> 24:32.677
- You have any
heating? It's freezing!

24:32.679 --> 24:34.547
- I told you to turn it
on, I'm normally in bed.

24:34.549 --> 24:36.879
- You are a wiz at gabbing.

24:36.881 --> 24:39.816
You should have a license.
- Shh!

24:39.818 --> 24:41.653
- Mm.
- I'll leave with some gear.

24:41.655 --> 24:42.786
- I said I would, didn't
I?

24:42.788 --> 24:44.216
But don't let your dad find out.

24:44.218 --> 24:46.185
If he does, he'll kill me.

24:46.187 --> 24:47.758
- No, he won't do
that. You're with me now.

24:47.760 --> 24:50.123
- Hey, you go easy on that.
- Mm-hmm.

24:50.125 --> 24:52.224
Go on, get that.

24:52.226 --> 24:55.700
Alright, off.

24:59.332 --> 25:00.364
What the fuck?

25:00.366 --> 25:02.839
Bull, what are you doin'?

25:02.841 --> 25:04.808
Have you been here the whole
time?

25:04.810 --> 25:05.677
- No, not the whole time, no.

25:05.679 --> 25:07.008
- What the fuck?

25:07.010 --> 25:09.109
Are you just gonna sit there,
yeah?

25:09.111 --> 25:10.946
- You do that with Aiden
upstairs?

25:10.948 --> 25:11.848
- Yeah, he's still asleep. Yeah?

25:13.819 --> 25:15.313
He's asleep.

25:15.315 --> 25:17.249
Don't fuckin' walk away from me!

25:17.251 --> 25:18.283
Oi, Bull, where are you going?

25:18.285 --> 25:19.790
- Shut up.
- Where are you going?

25:19.792 --> 25:21.154
- Gonna wake him.

25:21.156 --> 25:23.926
- Twat!

25:30.231 --> 25:32.671
Bull, come on, out of here.

25:35.775 --> 25:39.678
You'll fuckin' wake him,
just get out of here.

26:23.251 --> 26:25.724
- No, a bowl of
cereal, not two bowls.

26:25.726 --> 26:27.220
Do you know how much sugar's in
there?

26:27.222 --> 26:29.387
- When did you tell me
one bowl?

26:29.389 --> 26:31.224
Mum, come and take me to school!

26:31.226 --> 26:33.028
- No, wait there, mate,
don't come in here.

26:33.030 --> 26:34.931
- Why?
- Mum's asleep.

26:41.104 --> 26:44.138
- Am I takin' the bus
today?

26:46.241 --> 26:47.141
Dad?

26:52.412 --> 26:53.917
Dad?

26:53.919 --> 26:56.854
- Brush your teeth, I'll drive
you.

27:14.104 --> 27:15.873
- You havin' that?
- Nah, go ahead.

27:15.875 --> 27:16.907
- Good, lad.

27:19.912 --> 27:22.913
- Has anyone been up to the
field?

27:22.915 --> 27:23.815
- Why do that?

27:25.181 --> 27:26.046
- To check.

27:26.048 --> 27:27.852
- He's in the ground, no need to
check.

27:27.854 --> 27:28.920
- Yeah, too fuckin' right.

27:28.922 --> 27:32.021
No one goes up to the
fuckin' field. Understood?

27:32.023 --> 27:33.759
- What does Gemma know?

27:33.761 --> 27:36.762
- I spoke to Gemma, she
doesn't know anything.

27:39.228 --> 27:40.128
- How is she?

27:42.297 --> 27:43.197
She still bad?

27:45.399 --> 27:47.069
- Oi, DC Dickhead.

28:01.118 --> 28:02.183
- Sorry about Cheryl.

28:03.153 --> 28:04.350
- So am I.

28:04.352 --> 28:06.352
Tea or something?
- I've got time.

28:08.059 --> 28:08.891
- Marco?

28:08.893 --> 28:10.961
- He put a knife through his
mouth.

28:14.428 --> 28:15.834
- He's a fuckin' madman.

28:17.904 --> 28:19.805
- Bull?
- No, it ain't Bull,

28:19.807 --> 28:21.367
it's someone else.

28:21.369 --> 28:22.435
Bull's gone.

28:22.437 --> 28:24.810
Have you found out if he's
got a long-lost brother,

28:24.812 --> 28:26.207
a distant family or something?

28:26.209 --> 28:27.175
- He's got no brother.

28:27.177 --> 28:30.079
His mum still lives
local, so she's around.

28:31.115 --> 28:33.412
- Okay, okay, we can
go and pay her a visit.

28:33.414 --> 28:34.787
- I don't want you doing
anything--

28:36.186 --> 28:39.088
- Don't fuckin' tell me,
Mike, please don't tell me.

28:39.090 --> 28:40.188
Someone knows.

28:40.190 --> 28:41.992
Someone knows something.

28:41.994 --> 28:43.224
My people are dyin',

28:44.062 --> 28:46.359
so we will go and visit her.

28:47.494 --> 28:49.428
- I just want you to be careful.

28:49.430 --> 28:50.902
People still ask about Aiden--

28:50.904 --> 28:52.530
- Hey, Pedro, here's 40 quid on
the table.

28:52.532 --> 28:53.432
Thanks, pal.

28:54.635 --> 28:57.777
And you will talk to anyone
who was connected to Bull now.

28:58.571 --> 29:00.142
And you better do something.

29:01.178 --> 29:03.277
Don't let me do it myself.

29:56.629 --> 29:58.464
Marge!

29:58.466 --> 30:01.005
Margie, open the door!

30:01.007 --> 30:02.073
- The back door's open.
- Yep.

30:02.075 --> 30:04.569
- Go around the back.
- Yeah, you've locked it.

30:15.285 --> 30:16.416
No one mentions Bull.

30:20.191 --> 30:21.256
- Oh.
- Hello, Marge.

30:21.258 --> 30:22.994
No, don't get up, honey.

30:22.996 --> 30:24.391
How are you, pet?

30:24.393 --> 30:25.623
- What are you doing here?

30:25.625 --> 30:27.295
- Well, we had something
to do on the coast,

30:27.297 --> 30:29.231
so we just thought we'd
pop in and say hello.

30:29.233 --> 30:31.464
- Oh, Gary, you're not in
prison?

30:33.105 --> 30:37.008
- No, just good behavior.

30:37.010 --> 30:38.636
- Should we put the kettle on,
pet?

30:38.638 --> 30:40.308
- You'll have to do it, love.

30:40.310 --> 30:41.507
There's too many of you.

30:41.509 --> 30:43.212
- Colin, thanks, pal.

30:45.051 --> 30:46.479
So are you still putting your
bets on?

30:46.481 --> 30:48.316
- Mm, yeah. I never win
anything.

30:48.318 --> 30:49.548
- Yeah, me neither, darling,

30:49.550 --> 30:51.352
never win anything.
- No.

30:54.423 --> 30:56.995
- You can do your
bets on a computer now.

30:57.998 --> 30:59.230
- I haven't got a
computer.

30:59.232 --> 31:02.528
- She's 83. What the hell is
she gonna do with a computer?

31:02.530 --> 31:05.333
Aw, you've got some
memories up here, Marge.

31:07.304 --> 31:08.666
God, Gemma looks young.

31:10.241 --> 31:11.141
- She was happy.

31:13.112 --> 31:14.012
- Aye, she was.

31:17.446 --> 31:19.710
So how do you get out to put
your bets on?

31:19.712 --> 31:23.417
- Oh, taxi Mel takes me in.

31:24.684 --> 31:26.519
No, I've just had one. I'm
alright.

31:26.521 --> 31:27.586
- Aye, go on.

31:33.264 --> 31:34.692
- Never hear from Gemma, Norm.

31:36.630 --> 31:38.168
I'm still Aiden's gran.

31:38.170 --> 31:39.268
Whatever's gone on?

31:41.140 --> 31:42.040
- Ah, you know.

31:45.573 --> 31:47.078
Things change, Margie.

31:48.015 --> 31:50.576
- Look after the family
as a whole, Norman.

31:50.578 --> 31:52.017
You could have done that.

31:52.745 --> 31:54.514
You loved that boy.

31:56.056 --> 31:58.419
- She won anything?
- Nothin'.

31:59.620 --> 32:00.586
I can't find anything.

32:00.588 --> 32:03.094
I don't know if it's even the
right date.

32:03.096 --> 32:04.689
What date did you do these,
Marge?

32:05.560 --> 32:07.527
- I did them yesterday, I told
you.

32:07.529 --> 32:09.199
That's why I'm checking today.

32:12.039 --> 32:14.171
- We haven't got nothin' in.

32:20.014 --> 32:21.310
- Stop it, Norm.

32:24.315 --> 32:26.216
It's uncomfortable.

32:26.218 --> 32:29.417
I don't like being stared
at.

32:29.419 --> 32:31.518
- You heard about Cheryl?

32:32.752 --> 32:33.652
She's dead.

32:35.788 --> 32:36.688
Murdered.

32:41.134 --> 32:43.233
- Oh, I'm sorry.

32:43.235 --> 32:44.729
- Did you not hear anything
about it?

32:44.731 --> 32:46.632
- Oh, she's in London, isn't
she?

32:46.634 --> 32:49.206
Why should I've heard anything?

32:49.208 --> 32:51.109
- Marco, you know him?

32:52.475 --> 32:54.112
- Only through Bull.

32:54.114 --> 32:55.575
Well, I didn't know him.

32:57.150 --> 32:58.116
- He's dead too.

33:00.219 --> 33:01.119
Murdered.

33:04.091 --> 33:06.091
You been talking about Aiden to
anyone?

33:07.688 --> 33:09.523
- No, who would I talk to?

33:14.068 --> 33:15.134
- Wait for me to come out, boys.

33:15.136 --> 33:17.366
- No one around here knows
anything about anything.

33:20.338 --> 33:22.734
- You sure about this, Norm?

33:22.736 --> 33:23.636
- Get out.

33:25.508 --> 33:30.115
- Why
are they leaving, Norm?

33:30.810 --> 33:31.776
You're scaring me.

33:37.223 --> 33:41.192
What are you doing?

33:43.394 --> 33:45.097
- Do you know where Gemma lives?

33:45.825 --> 33:47.660
- No, no, I don't think so.
- No?

33:48.564 --> 33:50.465
You never tried to find out
where she is.

33:50.467 --> 33:52.335
- No. Why?

33:53.239 --> 33:55.305
I don't know where she is.

33:55.307 --> 33:58.407
I haven't got a phone number.

34:00.345 --> 34:01.872
- Margie, the people who are
dying

34:01.874 --> 34:03.412
are all connected to Bull.

34:06.252 --> 34:08.846
And that means they're
all connected to you.

34:14.755 --> 34:17.129
- Come on, Norm. Let's go.

34:18.264 --> 34:20.396
- Let me have my glasses, Norm.

34:32.674 --> 34:35.510
- Curse the fuckin'
day Gemma met your boy.

34:38.185 --> 34:41.219
- Your family were put on
this earth to destroy mine,

34:42.288 --> 34:43.650
and I'm not gonna allow it.

34:45.258 --> 34:48.556
Someone you know or
who knows you is trying

34:48.558 --> 34:50.492
to get to me and my blood.

34:52.727 --> 34:57.235
And I'm gonna have to cut you
bad until you tell me who.

36:17.009 --> 36:21.385
- Mum.

36:29.395 --> 36:30.295
Mum?

36:32.893 --> 36:35.498
- I'm not dead, Bull.

36:35.500 --> 36:37.863
Listen up, you, I'm not dead.

36:39.273 --> 36:41.372
I can't see you properly.

36:43.706 --> 36:45.640
I'm not dead, Bull.

36:54.816 --> 36:59.852
He hurt me.

37:10.931 --> 37:13.305
- You want me to help you?

37:19.577 --> 37:21.775
- What about you?

37:21.777 --> 37:23.348
What about Aiden?

37:33.789 --> 37:35.558
- Close your eyes, Mum.

38:39.459 --> 38:41.690
- You want another one?

38:41.692 --> 38:43.989
- She'll be openin' up, 15
minutes.

38:43.991 --> 38:45.727
- No one's stopping her.

38:45.729 --> 38:47.564
- Oh, what, so you're gonna
clear up after yourself,

38:47.566 --> 38:48.466
are you?

38:54.474 --> 38:55.836
- What are we gonna do, Bull?

38:58.412 --> 39:00.071
- What do you suggest?

39:00.073 --> 39:02.909
- She doesn't want to be with
you anymore.

39:02.911 --> 39:04.713
- You've known about that
for a while, have you?

39:04.715 --> 39:06.880
- No. Honestly, I haven't.

39:08.488 --> 39:11.588
- She can do what she
wants, Norm, grown up.

39:11.590 --> 39:13.557
- She wants to be with Gary.

39:15.726 --> 39:18.496
Look, Bull, I know she can
be a stubborn little mare,

39:19.796 --> 39:21.466
but she wants you out the house.

39:21.468 --> 39:22.159
- Fine.

39:23.262 --> 39:25.635
- I can get you
somewhere to stay, no problem.

39:25.637 --> 39:27.703
- Look, Clive, what the
fuck are you doin' here?

39:28.739 --> 39:29.969
- He's with me.
- Can't he speak?

39:29.971 --> 39:31.542
Can't you speak?

39:31.544 --> 39:33.511
- Don't blame me, Bull, I didn't
know.

39:36.813 --> 39:37.713
- Hey.

39:39.849 --> 39:42.179
Cut it out you two, grow up.

39:42.181 --> 39:43.686
Clive, get your arse somewhere
else

39:43.688 --> 39:45.116
before you piss yourself.

39:56.701 --> 39:58.800
Look, Son, I just want
everything

39:58.802 --> 40:00.967
to be very, very pleasant.

40:00.969 --> 40:03.002
And I'm Aiden's granddad.

40:05.072 --> 40:06.742
Whatever you're thinkin' about
Gary--

40:06.744 --> 40:08.007
- I don't care about Gary.

40:09.648 --> 40:10.714
- That's good.

40:10.716 --> 40:11.912
If anythin' happened to
him, I'd be really upset.

40:11.914 --> 40:13.177
- I don't care about Gary.

40:14.147 --> 40:16.147
Good, in that case--
- I want the boy.

40:17.051 --> 40:19.018
- That's not gonna
happen, Bull.

40:20.087 --> 40:22.087
- You know, she's
on the gear, don't you?

40:24.091 --> 40:25.959
- You can see him whenever.

40:25.961 --> 40:27.125
- Nope, I want him.

40:28.535 --> 40:30.062
She can do what she wants.

40:30.064 --> 40:31.063
She can have the money, the
house,

40:31.065 --> 40:31.864
she can let Gary fuck her.

40:31.866 --> 40:33.934
Let everyone have a go--
- Careful.

40:37.269 --> 40:39.170
- Is there something
you wanna add, Sharon?

40:42.516 --> 40:43.548
She can have it all.

40:45.783 --> 40:47.112
But she ain't havin' Aiden.

40:48.753 --> 40:50.181
You can tell her that from me.

41:19.113 --> 41:21.179
Done your bottom?
- Yeah.

41:21.181 --> 41:22.950
- Yeah, with soap, not just your
hands?

41:22.952 --> 41:24.754
No one likes a pooey bum.

41:26.252 --> 41:29.055
No girl's comin' with a--
- Oh! It went into my eyes!

41:29.057 --> 41:30.254

41:30.256 --> 41:32.564
- Rinse it off. Look at the

41:32.566 --> 41:35.061

41:35.063 --> 41:37.701
Come here, wuss.

41:37.703 --> 41:39.065
Look at that earhole.

41:39.067 --> 41:40.770
How much wax there is in there?

41:40.772 --> 41:42.772
You can get a candle outta that.

41:42.774 --> 41:45.137
Is that hot?
- No, it's fine.

41:50.111 --> 41:51.209
- Do the front.

41:51.211 --> 41:52.177
- Dad, you're getting it in my
eyes!

41:52.179 --> 41:53.079
- Alright.

42:05.192 --> 42:07.225
Finish your chapter before

42:07.227 --> 42:09.832

- Yeah, bollocks.

42:14.234 --> 42:15.640
Yeah?

42:15.642 --> 42:17.037
- Do you wanna go to the fair?

42:18.810 --> 42:20.876
- Aiden's dressed for bed, I
can't.

42:20.878 --> 42:21.778
- Bring him.

42:23.177 --> 42:25.749
- There'll be other nights,
boys. I can't do it.

42:26.653 --> 42:27.850
- Norm wants to see you.

42:30.052 --> 42:31.315
- Is he asking or telling?

42:36.894 --> 42:38.322
Alright, I'll see you in a bit.

42:39.699 --> 42:41.094
- He said we should take you.

42:43.736 --> 42:44.900
- No chance.

42:44.902 --> 42:46.000
If he wants me to come, I'll
come,

42:46.002 --> 42:47.936
but I'm driving meself.

42:47.938 --> 42:49.168
Tell him I'll be an hour.

42:54.109 --> 42:56.813

43:04.251 --> 43:06.889

43:06.891 --> 43:08.121
- Yeah. No, oh!

43:09.223 --> 43:11.861
- Hey, you got at least one!
- I think so.

43:11.863 --> 43:14.226
Nothing. See, you made a
noise and nothing's come out.

43:14.228 --> 43:15.128
- Oh yeah?

43:16.032 --> 43:17.867
- I'm coming for you.

43:19.266 --> 43:20.969
I'm coming for you.

43:21.807 --> 43:23.708
Oh, you got me.
- Five points.

43:23.710 --> 43:24.973
You kidding me.

43:28.682 --> 43:29.648
You gotta do the punch bag.

43:29.650 --> 43:31.309
Oh, come on.
- I told you, it's fixed, pal.

43:31.311 --> 43:32.277
- Oh, come on, it isn't.

43:32.279 --> 43:33.311
I can do it.

43:34.248 --> 43:35.447
Come on.

43:35.449 --> 43:38.184
- It'll give you the same
number however hard you hit it.

43:39.891 --> 43:40.723
Alright, excuse me, boys.

43:40.725 --> 43:43.860
Little Mike Tyson wants to have
go.

43:43.862 --> 43:46.698
Alright, I'm paying for two
goes.

43:56.776 --> 43:57.676
Ah, see?

43:58.844 --> 44:01.471
- You punch like a
baby.

44:01.473 --> 44:03.077
- See, I told you, broken.

44:15.454 --> 44:18.026
- You're well hard, Dad.

44:18.028 --> 44:18.895
- You're so mean,

44:18.897 --> 44:21.029
you make grown men cry.

44:22.032 --> 44:23.801
- I think you loosened it for
me.

44:25.497 --> 44:26.397
- Bull!

44:32.108 --> 44:33.943
- Hey.
- How are you, mate?

44:33.945 --> 44:34.845
- Yeah.

44:37.817 --> 44:38.849
- Not been on the dodgems?

44:38.851 --> 44:40.345
- No, we'll get to the dodgems.

44:41.183 --> 44:43.887
What's going on?
- Nothing.

44:43.889 --> 44:45.823
Just wanna talk some business
with you.

44:45.825 --> 44:48.155
Alright, my boy?
- Hey, granddad.

44:48.157 --> 44:50.762
- Guys, why don't you
take the kid for a ride?

44:50.764 --> 44:51.994
What do you fancy, Aiden?

44:51.996 --> 44:53.193
- The dodgems.
- Yeah.

44:53.195 --> 44:54.898
- No, I'll take you on the
dodgems.

44:54.900 --> 44:57.131
Take him on something else.

44:58.838 --> 44:59.738
- Come on.

45:02.336 --> 45:04.072
- Don't worry.

45:04.074 --> 45:05.469
Nothing's gonna happen to him.

45:10.410 --> 45:14.247
Let's go for a little
ride on the wheel, hey?

45:19.188 --> 45:20.088
Thanks, Richie.

46:05.003 --> 46:07.531
Okay, we're just gonna
sit here for a wee while

46:08.974 --> 46:10.039
and look at the view.

46:16.850 --> 46:20.478
- You know, she can fuck
everything up, Norm.

46:20.480 --> 46:22.084
It's not about Gary.

46:22.086 --> 46:24.889
- I know, but she is my lassie.

46:31.260 --> 46:32.963
- Hi, Mum.
- Hello.

46:35.968 --> 46:37.968
- You fucking cunt, Norm.

46:37.970 --> 46:40.201
- I did ask you, Bull.

46:40.203 --> 46:41.235
- In you go.

46:44.009 --> 46:45.206
- You fucking cunt!

46:46.880 --> 46:48.440
- Don't tempt me.

46:48.442 --> 46:51.212
I don't care who sees,
I'll split you wide open.

47:02.456 --> 47:04.291
- Now take it down.

47:04.293 --> 47:05.391
Take it down!

47:06.262 --> 47:07.459
Take it down.

47:07.461 --> 47:09.296
Take it down!

47:09.298 --> 47:10.396
Take it down!

47:14.105 --> 47:15.566
You cunts are dead.

47:17.108 --> 47:19.339
- He'll be alright.
- Fuckin' dead.

47:19.341 --> 47:21.242
- Yeah, they just do what
they're told.

47:21.244 --> 47:23.145
- I've known Marco his whole
life.

47:23.147 --> 47:25.983
- Yeah, but you ain't payin'
him.

47:27.184 --> 47:29.316
- Where's the boy?
- With his mum.

47:29.318 --> 47:31.450
You should have just left there.

47:31.452 --> 47:34.453
- Do you reckon she thinks
anything of you, you thick twat?

47:35.522 --> 47:37.126
- In the boot, Bull.

47:37.128 --> 47:39.931
- She's probably fucked
every man you know.

47:41.693 --> 47:43.396
- You wash your fuckin' mouth
out, Son,

47:43.398 --> 47:45.332
and never mention her name
again.

47:45.334 --> 47:47.169
Get him in the boot!

47:47.171 --> 47:48.269
Tie his hands!

47:55.047 --> 47:56.079
- Sorry, Bull.

48:08.962 --> 48:11.094
I would like a dog as well.

48:11.096 --> 48:13.096
That would be fun.

48:13.098 --> 48:13.998
- Hello, Clive.

48:20.732 --> 48:23.502
You knew I was coming. Why so
shocked?

48:23.504 --> 48:27.308
- Who are you?
- I'm the big bad wolf.

48:28.443 --> 48:31.147
You must be the little piggies,

48:32.711 --> 48:35.085
which makes you daddy pig.

48:43.095 --> 48:44.259
Cat got your tongue?

48:48.133 --> 48:49.033
- No.

48:51.631 --> 48:52.696
- Get in the car.

48:56.339 --> 48:59.439
- The kids are with me.
- We can all go together.

48:59.441 --> 49:03.641
Would you like to come with me
and daddy pig to the funfair?

49:04.776 --> 49:07.249
He told me he was gonna buy

49:07.251 --> 49:10.219
eight bags of candy floss for
your dinner.

49:11.651 --> 49:13.057
Sugar!

49:19.593 --> 49:21.098
- I can't, Bull.

49:22.662 --> 49:26.499
- If you don't come, I will
huff,

49:28.041 --> 49:29.172
and I'll puff,

49:30.274 --> 49:32.538
and I'll blow your house down.

49:39.646 --> 49:41.580
Mummy pig won't like that, will
she?

49:44.156 --> 49:46.783
- What are you gonna do?

49:46.785 --> 49:49.489
- We're gonna go on the rides,
Clive.

49:49.491 --> 49:50.391
Jump in.

49:55.761 --> 49:57.464
- It'll be alright.

50:12.283 --> 50:14.217
- What are you crying for?

50:15.715 --> 50:17.220
- Their mum's gonna be
worryin' about them.

50:17.222 --> 50:19.453
- Why? They're with their dad,
innit they?

50:19.455 --> 50:21.257
We're all going to the funfair.

50:23.129 --> 50:25.228
How are you two little piggies
getting on?

50:31.335 --> 50:35.832
- Bull? Bull, you won't
do anything to me kids?

50:37.308 --> 50:38.736
Please, Bull, please?

50:39.838 --> 50:41.475
- I haven't decided yet.

50:43.479 --> 50:44.412
Where is she?

50:45.283 --> 50:47.778
- Gemma?
- No, Alanis Morissette!

50:47.780 --> 50:49.153
Gemma!

50:49.155 --> 50:51.254
- I've not seen her in about
like...

50:51.256 --> 50:52.453
Not since she left Gary.

50:53.621 --> 50:55.786
- What about Aiden?
- I don't know.

50:56.690 --> 50:59.526
Norm doesn't say anything
about him or Gemma to us.

50:59.528 --> 51:02.463
Well, not to me, anyway.
- To Gary?

51:02.465 --> 51:03.629
- Look, you'll have to ask Gary.

51:03.631 --> 51:05.334
- I'm asking you.

51:05.336 --> 51:09.701
- She was in a
pretty bad way when she left,

51:09.703 --> 51:11.208
far gone with the heroin.

51:12.343 --> 51:15.245
- Phone Gary. Get him to the
funfair.

51:17.447 --> 51:18.713
- Like how?

51:18.715 --> 51:23.121
- I don't care how you do it,
daddy pig, just fucking do it.

52:03.526 --> 52:05.559
That was fun, wasn't it?

52:06.793 --> 52:07.693
- He's here.

52:08.531 --> 52:09.695
- Where?
- Waltzers.

52:10.797 --> 52:13.204
- Does he know I'm here?

52:13.206 --> 52:15.371
- No. I swear.

52:21.247 --> 52:22.345
God's me witness.

52:25.515 --> 52:26.613
I swear, Bull.

52:30.784 --> 52:34.687
- Well, then you can have your
candy floss back, daddy pig.

52:37.263 --> 52:37.954
Goodnight, kids.

53:02.486 --> 53:05.751
- Sick fuck.
- Gary, Gary, Gary.

53:05.753 --> 53:06.585
- It's true.

53:08.459 --> 53:11.295
- I'll cut you from bullock to
arse.

53:11.297 --> 53:12.129
- Where's Clive?

53:12.131 --> 53:14.331
- Safe and sound now you're
here.

53:14.333 --> 53:15.926
Come on, let's ride.

53:17.567 --> 53:18.467
- How?

53:19.470 --> 53:21.239
How?
- Not how, why.

53:28.611 --> 53:30.611
Hey, mate, how much is it?

53:30.613 --> 53:31.546
- 8 quid for both.

53:33.319 --> 53:35.946
- Here, this is for you and your
boys.

53:35.948 --> 53:37.453
Spin it like you're tryin' to
kill us.

53:37.455 --> 53:39.455
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, fast, don't stop.

53:39.457 --> 53:40.322
You understand?

53:40.324 --> 53:41.853
- You're the fucking boss,
mate.

53:41.855 --> 53:43.954
- You're gonna love this!

53:50.303 --> 53:51.929
Where is she?

53:51.931 --> 53:53.469
- Who?

53:53.471 --> 53:54.569
- Don't fuck about, Gary.

53:54.571 --> 53:56.065
It's gone past that.

53:56.067 --> 53:58.034
- I haven't seen her, Bull.

53:58.036 --> 54:00.509
I haven't seen her.
- You know where she is?

54:00.511 --> 54:02.038
- She left me not long after
you--

54:02.040 --> 54:03.875
- After I what?

54:03.877 --> 54:06.350
- I've been inside and I haven't
seen her.

54:06.352 --> 54:09.419
- Do you know where she is?

54:09.421 --> 54:10.981
Keep spinning, boys!

54:10.983 --> 54:12.587
Faster! Faster!

54:14.558 --> 54:16.855
Where Gary? Where is she?

54:16.857 --> 54:18.923
- Norm won't tell anyone.

54:18.925 --> 54:21.497
Jesus, Bull!
- Keep spinning!

54:22.401 --> 54:24.533
- Norm's often going to
Chardfon.

54:24.535 --> 54:25.963
She must be there!

54:27.406 --> 54:28.768
I'm not cheatin'!

54:29.639 --> 54:31.342
I'm sorry, Bull.

54:31.344 --> 54:32.772
Really, I'm sorry.

54:53.091 --> 54:53.991
- Yes!

54:55.830 --> 54:56.730
Yes!

54:58.635 --> 54:59.535
Yes!

55:01.803 --> 55:06.839
Yes!

57:04.596 --> 57:06.530
- What the fuck?

57:06.532 --> 57:07.696
What are you doing?

57:07.698 --> 57:09.467
Wait! What the fuck?

57:21.580 --> 57:22.445
Can you get off him, you little
prick!

57:22.447 --> 57:23.976
- Tell her to get out!
- Get off him!

57:23.978 --> 57:25.549
- Get out, Sally! Take
her out!

57:25.551 --> 57:26.275
- Stop fighting.

57:26.277 --> 57:27.343
You're gonna hurt yourself.

57:27.345 --> 57:29.520
- Who the fuck are you?
I don't fuckin' know you.

57:29.522 --> 57:31.181
- What have you got?
- What?

57:31.183 --> 57:32.985
- What have you got? What are
you selling?

57:32.987 --> 57:34.756
- Well, I've just got pills and
coke.

57:34.758 --> 57:35.757
You can have it, you can take
it.

57:35.759 --> 57:36.558
- I don't want it.

57:36.560 --> 57:38.826
Who's got heroin??
- Well, I don't.

57:40.258 --> 57:41.023
I haven't got any, I haven't got
any!

57:41.025 --> 57:44.062
I swear, I swear!
- Who? Who?

57:44.064 --> 57:46.097
Someone in this shitty town,
who?

57:46.968 --> 57:48.605
- Okay, alright, alright.

57:48.607 --> 57:50.772
I know a couple of people.

57:50.774 --> 57:53.269
You broke my
fuckin' fingers, man.

57:53.271 --> 57:55.238
Fuck's sake.

57:56.780 --> 57:59.275
What am I sayin'?
- Tell him I wanna see him.

57:59.277 --> 58:01.112
- He's not gonna come here
if he doesn't know you.

58:01.114 --> 58:02.652
- He will if I'm buying.

58:08.088 --> 58:10.726
- Dave, yeah, I've got
somebody who wants to meet.

58:13.291 --> 58:15.093
Yeah, but he doesn't want what
I got, he wants what you got.

58:15.095 --> 58:16.732
Alright, can we come over?

58:19.935 --> 58:23.299
Has he got money? You got money?

58:23.301 --> 58:24.641
Yeah, of course, he's got
fucking money!

58:24.643 --> 58:25.906
Why else am I calling you?

58:27.811 --> 58:28.942
Yes, okay, right.

58:28.944 --> 58:29.910
Yeah, okay, okay.

58:29.912 --> 58:30.911
Comin' over, right.

58:35.346 --> 58:37.082
Would you need me to go?

59:03.814 --> 59:05.715
Yeah, Dave, it's me. Can we come
up?

59:18.389 --> 59:20.290
- Yeah, go through, sit down.

59:20.292 --> 59:23.700
Yeah, shut the door, locks
itself.

59:59.364 --> 1:00:00.638
Do I know you?

1:00:03.137 --> 1:00:04.400
- No, you don't.

1:00:09.407 --> 1:00:11.143
- What happened to your
hand?

1:00:11.145 --> 1:00:14.850
- Nothing, trapped it.
- Bollocks.

1:00:14.852 --> 1:00:16.951
You've been dickin' people,
haven't you?

1:00:16.953 --> 1:00:20.086
Selling your shitty gear.

1:00:22.024 --> 1:00:25.828
You keep fit. Cardio?
- No.

1:00:25.830 --> 1:00:26.829
- You can be fat as a fuckin'
ass.

1:00:26.831 --> 1:00:29.227
As long as you've got
cardio, it don't matter.

1:00:30.098 --> 1:00:32.461
Eh, I hate runnin',
that's why I do football.

1:00:32.463 --> 1:00:34.265
Here you are, have them.

1:00:34.267 --> 1:00:37.037
Shin pads, socks, I've got
loads.

1:00:38.172 --> 1:00:41.811
Top tip, always play with kids.

1:00:42.715 --> 1:00:44.341
The kids don't run, but I do.

1:00:45.344 --> 1:00:47.179
That's why I show 'em up.

1:00:47.181 --> 1:00:48.752
That's why I drink this shit.

1:00:48.754 --> 1:00:51.084
That's why I get 10
fucking goals a game, mate.

1:01:06.068 --> 1:01:07.364
Let's see your money then.

1:01:11.744 --> 1:01:14.338
- I'll swap you, a swig of that
drink.

1:01:33.491 --> 1:01:38.769
- Fuck!

1:01:38.771 --> 1:01:40.166
- Stay where you are. Stay!

1:01:49.144 --> 1:01:51.243
- Oh, God! What the fuck?

1:01:53.544 --> 1:01:54.785
Who are you?

1:01:55.513 --> 1:01:57.348
What have I done?

1:01:57.350 --> 1:01:59.218
- You've done enough, Dave.

1:01:59.220 --> 1:02:01.121
Come on, let's fix it.

1:02:03.488 --> 1:02:04.454
Bite down on that.

1:02:04.456 --> 1:02:06.555
- What? What are you doing?

1:02:06.557 --> 1:02:08.194
- You don't want to bleed to
death.

1:02:08.196 --> 1:02:13.232
Bite down on it.

1:02:16.468 --> 1:02:18.468
You been in this flat before?

1:02:19.504 --> 1:02:21.174
- Yeah.

1:02:21.176 --> 1:02:23.275
- You know where he keeps
his money and stuff?

1:02:24.212 --> 1:02:25.442
- Yeah.

1:02:25.444 --> 1:02:27.411
- Go and get it.

1:02:27.413 --> 1:02:28.313
He won't need it.

1:02:43.429 --> 1:02:45.165
Oi, wake up now.

1:02:47.939 --> 1:02:48.839
You get it?

1:02:49.567 --> 1:02:51.468
What is it? Money and gear?

1:02:53.373 --> 1:02:55.505
- Money, pills, and a few rings
and that.

1:02:56.915 --> 1:02:58.948
- Leave the money, take
everything else.

1:03:01.150 --> 1:03:03.282
If you see him again, tell him I
done it.

1:03:17.870 --> 1:03:18.561
Hey. Hey.

1:03:21.203 --> 1:03:26.239
- Dammit.

1:03:26.978 --> 1:03:28.274
What did I do to you?

1:03:30.982 --> 1:03:32.212
- Gemma Harris.

1:03:33.215 --> 1:03:36.953
- What? What about
her?

1:03:36.955 --> 1:03:37.855
- Where is she?

1:03:41.091 --> 1:03:42.288
- At home, probably.

1:03:45.128 --> 1:03:48.899
- You know where that is?
- Yeah. Of course I do.

1:03:58.504 --> 1:03:59.503
- What number?

1:03:59.505 --> 1:04:03.045
I only know the house.

1:04:03.047 --> 1:04:04.112
- Tell me which one.

1:04:05.445 --> 1:04:07.412
- The last one, in the
corner.

1:04:14.388 --> 1:04:16.487
- You wanna stay in here?

1:04:16.489 --> 1:04:18.126
- I'll just lay here.

1:04:20.097 --> 1:04:21.932
I think I'm bleeding on the
seat.

1:05:50.154 --> 1:05:53.716
- Stand up.

1:06:08.667 --> 1:06:13.703
- I'm fuckin' struggling.

1:06:20.118 --> 1:06:23.119
- Gary, get out.
- Why do I have to go?

1:06:23.121 --> 1:06:23.820
- 'Cause it's your fuckin' fault

1:06:23.822 --> 1:06:24.648
we're here in the first place.

1:06:24.650 --> 1:06:25.550
Get out.

1:06:31.459 --> 1:06:33.657
Bull, you want some of this?

1:06:33.659 --> 1:06:37.496
- How long am I staying?
- I've honestly no idea.

1:06:37.498 --> 1:06:39.267
Depends how long she takes to
get here,

1:06:39.269 --> 1:06:41.302
but you've certainly pissed her
off.

1:06:41.304 --> 1:06:43.601
- No change there then.

1:06:43.603 --> 1:06:45.207
- You guys want some of this?

1:06:59.586 --> 1:07:02.554
So, where did it all go wrong,
Son?

1:07:05.097 --> 1:07:06.558
- When I married your daughter.

1:07:08.793 --> 1:07:09.726
- Probably.

1:07:13.699 --> 1:07:15.270
- Anything happens to him...

1:07:15.272 --> 1:07:17.239
- Nothing's gonna happen to him.

1:07:17.241 --> 1:07:18.207
He's my grandson.

1:07:19.639 --> 1:07:21.474
Why don't you drink your
whiskey, Bull?

1:07:22.378 --> 1:07:23.278
It'll help.

1:07:27.218 --> 1:07:28.712
Is that her?

1:07:28.714 --> 1:07:30.615
- I can't see, there's
headlights.

1:07:30.617 --> 1:07:32.353
- Now, go and to take a look,
will you?

1:07:39.890 --> 1:07:41.263
- You cunt, Bull!

1:07:41.265 --> 1:07:42.363
Slimy little arsehole!

1:07:42.365 --> 1:07:43.230
I should never have married you!

1:07:43.232 --> 1:07:45.300
- Gemma, get off! What are you
doing?

1:07:45.302 --> 1:07:46.001
Get off! Get off!

1:07:46.003 --> 1:07:47.533
Get in the bedroom!
- Why?

1:07:47.535 --> 1:07:49.271
- 'Cause I said so and
you're fuckin' drunk!

1:07:49.273 --> 1:07:51.273
- Oh, bollock!
- Marco, get her in there!

1:07:51.275 --> 1:07:53.407
- And you think she's gonna
look after Aiden, do you?

1:07:53.409 --> 1:07:54.837
- I'll look after
him better than you!

1:07:54.839 --> 1:07:57.609
- She gets what she wants,
Bull, you know that.

1:08:11.658 --> 1:08:14.263
- Call your dad get him down
here.

1:08:15.266 --> 1:08:17.167
Tell him I'm outside.

1:08:17.169 --> 1:08:18.894
- What? Why?

1:08:18.896 --> 1:08:20.896
- Tell him I'm asleep
in the back of the car

1:08:20.898 --> 1:08:22.865
parked directly outside your
house.

1:08:25.342 --> 1:08:26.308
- What do you want from him?

1:08:26.310 --> 1:08:28.574
- Dial the number, tell him
you're scared.

1:08:28.576 --> 1:08:29.608
- I am scared.

1:08:29.610 --> 1:08:30.807
Please, I am scared, Bull.

1:08:30.809 --> 1:08:33.777
- I will cut your throat
if you fuck it up.

1:08:40.423 --> 1:08:42.489
- Dad? Dad, Bull's
outside.

1:08:47.298 --> 1:08:48.198
He's outside in the car.

1:08:50.697 --> 1:08:52.730
No, no, no, he's asleep.

1:08:54.932 --> 1:08:55.832
How long?

1:09:00.608 --> 1:09:02.872
- How long will he be?
- 25 minutes.

1:09:02.874 --> 1:09:05.578
What are you gonna do, Bull?

1:09:05.580 --> 1:09:07.349
Wait, no, no, no, no--

1:09:18.725 --> 1:09:21.792
- I gotta ask you this,
Bull.

1:09:25.336 --> 1:09:27.732
What are you gonna do if
ever you got out of this?

1:09:30.506 --> 1:09:31.571
- Honestly?

1:09:31.573 --> 1:09:33.474
- Yeah, you're an honest guy.

1:09:34.807 --> 1:09:38.314
- If I get out of this, I'll
fucking kill every one of you.

1:09:38.316 --> 1:09:41.779
- Yeah, I thought so.

1:09:44.421 --> 1:09:46.883
Gemma, sure?

1:09:52.792 --> 1:09:53.692
- Yeah.

1:09:55.564 --> 1:09:57.696
- Go get the petrol.

1:10:00.668 --> 1:10:02.734
Look at this drink, Bull! Yeah.

1:10:02.736 --> 1:10:05.605
Come on, drink it up,
you won't feel a thing.

1:10:11.008 --> 1:10:15.648
Yeah.

1:10:15.650 --> 1:10:16.550
There.

1:10:27.596 --> 1:10:28.991
Everybody out!

1:11:29.625 --> 1:11:31.493
Wrap the gun in your coat.

1:11:31.495 --> 1:11:33.055
- What? And shoot through the
window?

1:11:34.025 --> 1:11:35.497
- Unless the door's open.

1:12:07.861 --> 1:12:08.761
- Done.

1:12:13.801 --> 1:12:15.768
- Okay, take the body somewhere
else,

1:12:15.770 --> 1:12:17.506
dump it in the sea or something.

1:12:17.508 --> 1:12:18.408
- Yeah.

1:12:38.826 --> 1:12:39.726
- Gem?

1:12:42.896 --> 1:12:43.798
Gemma?

1:12:47.637 --> 1:12:48.369
Gemma?

1:13:09.758 --> 1:13:13.991
- Guess who, Norman?

1:13:15.533 --> 1:13:17.533
Looks like you're shot her.

1:13:19.735 --> 1:13:20.833
If you'd had done that years
ago,

1:13:20.835 --> 1:13:22.230
none of this would have
happened.

1:13:22.232 --> 1:13:23.638
- How, Bull?

1:13:23.640 --> 1:13:26.003
How the hell...

1:13:26.005 --> 1:13:27.906
- It's a long story.

1:13:27.908 --> 1:13:29.105
How long you got?

1:13:33.045 --> 1:13:37.113
Bite down on your hand, I'll sum
it.

1:13:37.115 --> 1:13:38.884
I'm gonna do it, so bite that.

1:13:44.056 --> 1:13:45.561
I know it hurts, you bastard.

1:13:45.563 --> 1:13:47.959
It serves you fuckin' right.

1:13:53.197 --> 1:13:57.067
You got hell to look forward to
you, yeah?

1:14:05.583 --> 1:14:07.649
You can work that out without
.

1:14:07.651 --> 1:14:08.683
- You prick!

1:14:14.185 --> 1:14:15.085
- Come on.

1:14:16.561 --> 1:14:18.022
- I wanna see it burn.

1:14:25.867 --> 1:14:26.532
Oh shit!
- Mum?

1:14:26.534 --> 1:14:27.366
- Aiden!
- What's going on?

1:14:27.368 --> 1:14:28.868
- What the hell is he doing
here?

1:14:28.870 --> 1:14:29.968
- Where else am I gonna leave
him?

1:14:29.970 --> 1:14:30.837
- Mum, what's goin' on?
- Marco, get him

1:14:30.839 --> 1:14:31.771
back in the car now!

1:14:31.773 --> 1:14:33.268
- Get in the car, Aiden.
- It's burning up.

1:14:33.270 --> 1:14:34.676
- Get back in the car, Aiden.

1:14:34.678 --> 1:14:35.543
Aiden!
- Mum, what is going on?

1:14:35.545 --> 1:14:36.744
- Are you out of your fucking
mind?

1:14:36.746 --> 1:14:37.646
- Mum!
- Get back in the car.

1:14:40.211 --> 1:14:41.177
- Dad! Dad!

1:14:42.312 --> 1:14:43.144
Dad!
- Get in the car, Aiden.

1:14:43.146 --> 1:14:45.654
- Mum, what's going on?

1:14:45.656 --> 1:14:47.623
- In the car, Aiden!
- Dad!

1:14:51.255 --> 1:14:53.761
Dad!
- Shoot him, Norm!

1:14:53.763 --> 1:14:55.059
- Dad!

1:14:55.061 --> 1:14:57.567
- Norm, he's fucking baking!

1:14:59.098 --> 1:15:00.669
Shoot him!

1:15:00.671 --> 1:15:01.637
- Dad! Dad!

1:15:07.304 --> 1:15:08.204
Dad, Dad!

1:15:10.648 --> 1:15:12.813
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad!

1:15:25.190 --> 1:15:26.695
- You can hear him can't you?

1:15:28.600 --> 1:15:30.831
You can hear him screaming.

1:15:32.131 --> 1:15:34.604
Where is he? Where is he?
- No!

1:15:36.267 --> 1:15:39.268
- Look at me!

1:15:39.270 --> 1:15:40.302
Where is he?

1:15:41.272 --> 1:15:43.272
Look in my eyes!

1:15:43.274 --> 1:15:44.306
Look at 'em!

1:15:45.980 --> 1:15:47.782
Where is he?

1:15:47.784 --> 1:15:48.816
Where is he?

1:15:52.822 --> 1:15:54.052
- No, Bull, no.

1:16:01.963 --> 1:16:02.895
No!
- Where is he?

1:16:02.897 --> 1:16:06.834
- No, no, no, no, no, no!
- Where is he?

1:16:06.836 --> 1:16:10.233
- He's down at the broken
bridge,
the broken bridge in town.

1:16:10.235 --> 1:16:12.202
Dad! Get off him, please.

1:16:12.204 --> 1:16:14.336
Get off him, Bull, please.

1:16:14.338 --> 1:16:15.942
- You were supposed to look
after him.

1:16:16.811 --> 1:16:19.143
What the fuck did you do to him,
Gemma?

1:16:20.014 --> 1:16:21.783
Why, Gemma?
- He deserved better!

1:16:21.785 --> 1:16:23.983
He said he didn't want helping.

1:16:23.985 --> 1:16:25.281
- How could you do that to our
boy?

1:16:25.283 --> 1:16:28.086
- I don't know. I'm sorry.

1:16:28.088 --> 1:16:29.186
I'm sorry.

1:16:29.188 --> 1:16:31.056
- You got him on the gear!

1:16:31.058 --> 1:16:33.322
- Please, get off him, please!

1:16:36.096 --> 1:16:37.865
Oh, no! Get off him!

1:16:47.437 --> 1:16:49.811
You've killed him!

1:16:49.813 --> 1:16:54.849
Please! Please!

1:17:00.956 --> 1:17:01.922
No, please.

1:17:04.157 --> 1:17:05.123
Please, no.

1:18:30.408 --> 1:18:31.506
- Look at me.

1:18:32.410 --> 1:18:34.542
Hey, look at me!

1:18:41.221 --> 1:18:42.121
Come here.

1:18:44.257 --> 1:18:46.191
Come here.

1:18:46.193 --> 1:18:47.962
Aiden, come on, Son.

1:18:48.899 --> 1:18:49.799
Come on.

1:18:53.497 --> 1:18:54.969
Come on.

1:18:54.971 --> 1:18:55.871
Come on.

1:18:56.907 --> 1:18:59.875
Let's get you out of here. Come
on.

1:20:03.875 --> 1:20:06.909
- Where am I?
- You're with me, Son.

1:20:33.564 --> 1:20:36.004
Now, we wait.

1:20:36.006 --> 1:20:36.972
- How long?

1:20:38.008 --> 1:20:40.470
- How long's a piece of string?

1:20:41.946 --> 1:20:42.637
- A meter?

1:20:54.024 --> 1:20:55.518
Are you happy, Dad?

1:21:02.065 --> 1:21:02.965
- Yeah.

1:21:04.100 --> 1:21:06.034
Sittin' here, fishing with you,

1:21:07.004 --> 1:21:09.235
it's a lovely day, the birds are
singing.

1:21:11.008 --> 1:21:15.076
I love you.

1:22:01.619 --> 1:22:05.027
- Hello?

1:22:05.029 --> 1:22:07.722
Hello?

1:22:07.724 --> 1:22:11.528
Hello?

1:22:17.305 --> 1:22:18.667
- He's alive.

1:22:22.772 --> 1:22:25.377
- No.

1:22:29.086 --> 1:22:32.252
How dare you enter here.
How dare you enter here!

1:22:33.156 --> 1:22:35.486
This is a house of God!

1:22:35.488 --> 1:22:39.193
Please.

1:22:41.362 --> 1:22:42.724
What do you want?

1:22:45.531 --> 1:22:46.563
- Salvation.

1:22:48.105 --> 1:22:49.203
- Impossible.

1:22:50.305 --> 1:22:51.205
No. Never!

1:22:53.506 --> 1:22:54.406
Never!

1:22:57.444 --> 1:22:58.344
- For him.

1:23:00.381 --> 1:23:01.281
My son.

1:23:04.121 --> 1:23:05.549
Give him a chance.

1:23:16.265 --> 1:23:19.167
Help him spend this getting
clean.

1:23:24.240 --> 1:23:27.604
- Please, please, please,
please, please.

1:23:30.213 --> 1:23:31.245
- Thank you.

1:23:44.755 --> 1:23:46.788
- You're not right, Bull.

1:23:46.790 --> 1:23:50.693
You're evil. There's
something's wrong with you.

1:23:50.695 --> 1:23:52.398
- You have no idea.

1:23:55.370 --> 1:23:59.768
Aiden!

1:24:02.839 --> 1:24:05.609
- Where'd you go?
- Hell.

1:24:05.611 --> 1:24:06.511
Aiden!

1:24:07.778 --> 1:24:10.746
Phone Gary, get him to the
funfair.

1:24:10.748 --> 1:24:15.652
I don't care how you do it,
daddy pig, just fucking do it.

1:24:19.757 --> 1:24:21.790
Look at my eyes!

1:24:21.792 --> 1:24:23.627
Look at 'em!

1:24:23.629 --> 1:24:24.595
Look at me!

1:24:26.665 --> 1:24:27.697
- How, Bull?

1:24:28.799 --> 1:24:31.833
How the hell...
- It's a long story.

1:24:32.803 --> 1:24:34.374
How long you got?
