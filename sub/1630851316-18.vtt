10:39.203 --> 10:41.641
and that was the only evidence
I needed to take him down.

Then he was deported to Mexico
to serve a life sentence.

11:06.970 --> 11:08.755
probably won't be long
until he does.

11:08.798 --> 11:10.931
[cell phone chimes]Then we better find him first.

11:11.975 --> 11:13.542
Kasie.

11:18.765 --> 11:21.071
Oh, Nick, I need you.

11:21.115 --> 11:23.117
Do you remember all the guys
in Diaz's crew?

11:23.160 --> 11:24.553
Most of them, yeah.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.076
Okay, look through
these photos.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.469
Let me know if you
recognize anyone.

11:27.512 --> 11:28.557
What am I looking at?

11:28.600 --> 11:30.211
The Camargo Bridge
border crossing

11:30.254 --> 11:32.648
in Rio Grande City, Texas.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.129
I think it's where
Diaz entered the U.S.

11:35.172 --> 11:36.739
What makes you think that?Shush.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.306
Don't distract him.

11:38.349 --> 11:39.873
Okay, he needs
to concentrate.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.658
But allow me to walk you
through the process.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.921
Diaz walked out of this prison

11:44.965 --> 11:47.054
two nights ago at 10:30 p.m.

11:47.097 --> 11:49.317
33 hours later,
he killed three people

11:49.360 --> 11:51.014
at a Virginia rest stop.

11:51.058 --> 11:52.363
He had to cross the border.

11:52.407 --> 11:54.235
Kasie, not to throw
a wet towel on this,

11:54.278 --> 11:56.759
but there are over 300
ports of entry into the U.S.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.979
Alden, not to throw
a wet towel

11:59.022 --> 12:00.632
over your wet towel,

12:00.676 --> 12:03.723
but I've already narrowed down
the list of possibilities.

12:03.766 --> 12:06.116
Diaz's passport was revoked,
so he couldn't fly.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.770
He could have got a fake I.D.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.163
No, Diaz is too famous to walk

12:09.206 --> 12:10.468
through an airport
without getting caught.

12:10.512 --> 12:13.123
So, you think he went by car.

12:13.167 --> 12:14.777
I do.

12:14.821 --> 12:17.040
His prison is in Nuevo León.

12:17.084 --> 12:19.390
It's a straight shot
north into Texas.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.392
Lot of border crossings
in Texas.

12:21.436 --> 12:23.394
Well, 28, to be exact,

12:23.438 --> 12:26.571
but with the Mexican police
on his ass, I am guessing

12:26.615 --> 12:28.312
he picked the closest one.

12:28.356 --> 12:30.184
Camargo Bridge?

12:30.227 --> 12:32.229
It's a four-hour drive
from the prison.

12:32.273 --> 12:35.102
I pulled the photos
from all the cars

12:35.145 --> 12:37.191
that drove into the U.S.
between 2:00

12:37.234 --> 12:39.323
and 3:00 a.m. yesterday.But you said so yourself,

12:39.367 --> 12:41.151
the border guards
would've recognized him.

12:41.195 --> 12:43.197
Not if he was hiding
in the trunk.

12:45.373 --> 12:47.070
Those are Diaz's guys.

12:47.114 --> 12:49.638
I don't remember
the passenger's name,

12:49.681 --> 12:51.248
but the driver,
I'll never forget.

12:51.292 --> 12:52.815
René Romero.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.208
He goes by Renny.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.036
PARKER:
Sounds like you have a history.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.821
Yeah, you can say that.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.562
He tried to kill me.

13:00.605 --> 13:02.738
Ooh. I really want to hear
that story,

13:02.782 --> 13:04.174
but it'll have to wait.

13:04.218 --> 13:06.350
Renny's got a record.

13:06.394 --> 13:09.266
And I've got
the last known address.

13:11.051 --> 13:13.053
This guy Diaz
must really hate you.

13:13.096 --> 13:15.446
He hates Salazar, not me.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.927
That's right.
I read the report.

13:17.971 --> 13:20.234
You played Salazar
for five months.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.540
That's a long time
to be somebody else.

13:22.584 --> 13:23.933
Yep.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.239
What was it like?

13:25.282 --> 13:26.980
Come on, McGee.

13:27.023 --> 13:28.633
You know what it's like.

13:28.677 --> 13:30.374
You've done it before.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.333
Yeah, but not for that long.

13:32.376 --> 13:34.639
Plus, I never dated a mark.

13:37.207 --> 13:39.688
You two must have gotten close.

What was she like?

She was a...

She was a mark.Well,

13:54.224 --> 13:56.139
whatever you did
must have worked.

13:57.140 --> 13:59.142
She testified against Diaz.

14:00.361 --> 14:03.146
How'd you convince her
to flip on her own cousin?

14:04.191 --> 14:05.801
I made her a promise.

14:07.803 --> 14:09.936
I told her I'd join her
in witness protection

14:09.979 --> 14:12.808
and that we'd live
happily ever after.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.681
Wow.Yeah.

14:16.725 --> 14:19.510
It was the only way that I could
get her to testify against Diaz.

14:19.554 --> 14:23.123
So, she flipped on Diaz,
you flipped on her?

14:23.166 --> 14:25.342

Yeah.

Hold on.

15:08.777 --> 15:09.996
What up, Renny?

15:10.039 --> 15:12.041
Hey, Carlos.

15:13.434 --> 15:15.218
Or should I say Nick?

15:15.262 --> 15:18.265
Guess Diaz isn't chasing
a ghost anymore.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.452
That's twice.

15:31.495 --> 15:33.845
That's twice
that you tried to kill me.

15:33.889 --> 15:35.195
But hey,

15:35.238 --> 15:36.631
I'm still standing.

was a misunderstanding.

You should know,

when Diaz gives an order,
you do it.

The old "My gunrunning boss

well with the jury.

where is he?

16:04.702 --> 16:06.269
Well, that is too bad.

I didn't. Diaz did.

How?

his real identity

She's in witness protection.

that Reymundo Diaz

18:10.306 --> 18:12.830
bought his way out of prison
and is in the U.S.

18:12.874 --> 18:15.746

that Maria Diaz is in danger.

18:15.790 --> 18:16.834
No, she isn't.

18:16.878 --> 18:19.010
She's safe, I can assure you.

Because protecting people

We're pros.

18:23.754 --> 18:25.713
So is Diaz.

18:25.756 --> 18:27.671
When was the last time
you spoke to her?

18:27.715 --> 18:29.673
A few days ago.How many? Two? Three?

18:29.717 --> 18:30.892
More like a week.

18:30.935 --> 18:32.241
That's more than a few.

We tried to call her

but we got her voice mail.

18:35.549 --> 18:37.725
That-that's not atypical.

18:37.768 --> 18:38.987
She values her privacy.

18:39.030 --> 18:40.771
If she's not answering,
why are you not

18:40.815 --> 18:42.599
sending somebody
to go check on her?

I know you're concerned, but
she's got a new identity.

She lives in a
different state.

will never find her.

Diaz killed those three men

trying to find me.

19:00.356 --> 19:01.662
He found me.

19:01.705 --> 19:03.838
Diaz tried to have
Agent Torres killed

19:03.881 --> 19:07.015
this morning, and we think
he's going after Maria next.

Well, that was ATF.

19:25.729 --> 19:27.731
It is radio silence out there.

19:27.775 --> 19:30.647
No chatter on Diaz
or any potential gun deals.

19:30.691 --> 19:32.606
That's because he's not making
a gun deal.

19:32.649 --> 19:33.998
How's that?

19:34.042 --> 19:35.348
I kept grilling Renny.

19:35.391 --> 19:37.785
He said that Diaz
is out of the gun business.

19:37.828 --> 19:39.613
Yesterday, Diaz sent Renny

19:39.656 --> 19:42.572
to a shady pharmacy in Culpeper
to pick up some pills.

19:42.616 --> 19:44.008
What kind of pills?

19:44.052 --> 19:46.272
Renny doesn't know.
But he said, whatever they were,

19:46.315 --> 19:48.404
Diaz was looking
to buy a lot more.

19:48.448 --> 19:50.798
Well, if Diaz is switching
from dealing guns to drugs,

19:50.841 --> 19:52.626
that would make sense
why every lead

When she assumed
her new identity,

21:26.415 --> 21:28.287
Where's he going?

21:29.375 --> 21:31.028
There's a hotel nearby

21:31.072 --> 21:32.465
I'll see if it's available.

21:32.508 --> 21:33.640

Go to the hotel.
Get some rest.

21:49.177 --> 21:50.918

I don't think you called me

21:55.401 --> 21:57.533
Then why did I call you?

21:57.577 --> 21:59.840
Well, I don't know,

21:59.883 --> 22:02.799
that you don't sound
like yourself tonight.

22:02.843 --> 22:04.540
Well, it's me.

You don't sound sober.

I'm not.

And-and that's okay.

It's about progress,
not perfection.

22:16.552 --> 22:19.120
What's important
is that you're being honest.

Honest?

I honestly want to put my fist

More specific, Nick.

Speaking of Diaz,

27:30.561 --> 27:33.129

exactly what drug he's moving?

27:33.173 --> 27:36.916
I called Happy's Pharmacy to ask
what pills Diaz's guy picked up.

27:36.959 --> 27:39.005
They wouldn't talk.
So then I went to Happy's

27:39.048 --> 27:41.094
last night
posing as a pillhead,

27:41.137 --> 27:42.704

I flashed my badge,

27:44.488 --> 27:45.925
and then they
wouldn't stop talking to me.

27:45.968 --> 27:47.448
So, what is he dealing?

27:47.491 --> 27:48.928
Percocet? Fentanyl?

27:48.971 --> 27:50.581
Not even close.

for this Perpexofal

28:02.376 --> 28:03.725
on the black market?

28:03.769 --> 28:04.726
Nope.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.859
So why would Diaz want that?

28:06.902 --> 28:08.382
I called the Mexican
prison warden,

28:08.425 --> 28:10.079
and he didn't give any details,

28:10.123 --> 28:12.647
but he did say
that Diaz is very sick.

28:14.214 --> 28:17.391
If Diaz is dying, that explains
why our arms dealer

He wants revenge.

for the best.

28:50.119 --> 28:51.773
What? I don't snore.

28:51.817 --> 28:55.255
Carlos Salazar used to say
the same thing six years ago.

28:56.604 --> 28:58.649
Carlos used to say
a lot of things.

28:59.694 --> 29:00.913
You should get dressed.

hoodie for you.

29:05.961 --> 29:08.224
Okay. And then what?

29:08.268 --> 29:11.227
And then I call
NCIS protection detail.

29:11.271 --> 29:13.403
And when they show up,

29:13.447 --> 29:17.233
I'll leave

29:59.623 --> 30:01.930
That's all I was?

30:01.974 --> 30:03.976
An assignment?

30:06.456 --> 30:09.372
It sucks. I know.

Don't bother.

32:53.754 --> 32:55.669
His name is
Marshal John Wright.

32:55.712 --> 32:58.324
Maria's contact at WITSEC.

32:58.367 --> 33:00.065
And they didn't just beat him.

33:00.108 --> 33:01.544
They tortured him.

33:01.588 --> 33:03.938
Did Wright know where
Maria and Torres were hiding?

33:03.982 --> 33:06.810
Call Torres and tell him to get
the hell out of that hotel.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.430
How'd Diaz find us?

33:17.473 --> 33:18.997
Keep moving.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.650
Where are we going?Anywhere but here.

33:21.651 --> 33:22.870
[gunfire]

33:22.913 --> 33:24.263
Go, go, go, go, go!

33:24.306 --> 33:25.742
Go back.

33:26.917 --> 33:28.876
[panting softly]

33:28.919 --> 33:30.834
Go, go, go, go.
Get down.

33:32.445 --> 33:35.491
You hurt?I don't think so.

33:35.535 --> 33:37.841
Listen to me. Listen to me.

33:37.885 --> 33:40.279
You can do this.Do what?

33:42.803 --> 33:44.848
Dude, are you kidding me?

33:44.892 --> 33:46.459
You trust me, right?No.

33:46.502 --> 33:48.200
Okay, that was
a stupid question.

33:48.243 --> 33:49.853
What do you expect me to do?

33:49.897 --> 33:52.769
I want you to shoot anyone
who walks through that door.

33:53.944 --> 33:56.425
When I leave,
you call this number.

33:56.469 --> 33:58.253
You tell them Diaz is here.

33:58.297 --> 33:59.646
Where are you going?

34:00.690 --> 34:02.083
I'm gonna end this.

34:02.127 --> 34:03.780
I'm gonna get Diaz
before he gets you.

34:03.824 --> 34:06.174
You shoot anyone
who walks through that door.

34:08.263 --> 34:10.483
Wait. What if it's you?

34:10.526 --> 34:11.832
Then don't shoot.

34:11.875 --> 34:13.399
Maybe we should have a signal.

34:13.442 --> 34:15.096
Like knock twice or something.

34:15.140 --> 34:17.272
Fine, I'll knock twice.

34:18.273 --> 34:19.535
Hey.

34:21.189 --> 34:23.104
Don't die.

34:30.590 --> 34:32.374
McGEE: Torres, talk to me.It's Maria.

34:32.418 --> 34:34.028
Diaz is here. We-we need help.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.725
All right, hang on.
We're ten minutes out.

34:35.769 --> 34:37.292
We don't have ten minutes.

34:37.336 --> 34:39.990
[distant door opens and closes]

34:40.034 --> 34:41.427
[whispers]:
I got to go.

34:52.829 --> 34:54.266
Diaz!

34:55.267 --> 34:57.095
Heard you were looking for me.

34:57.138 --> 34:59.140
You stole six years of my life.

34:59.184 --> 35:00.750
Why don't you
put your weapon down,

35:00.794 --> 35:02.143
and we can talk about it.

35:02.187 --> 35:03.449
[chuckles]
Okay.

35:03.492 --> 35:04.711
You first!

35:11.500 --> 35:13.502
[gunfire continues]

35:15.330 --> 35:16.853
[lock beeps]

35:16.897 --> 35:18.116
TORRES:
Diaz!

35:18.159 --> 35:20.857
You're not leaving
this hotel alive.

35:20.901 --> 35:21.902
DIAZ:
I don't care!

35:21.945 --> 35:24.122
I came here to take you with me.

35:24.165 --> 35:25.688
You're gonna
have to kill me first.

35:27.299 --> 35:29.127
[gunfire continues]

35:34.436 --> 35:36.786
That was a lot of ammo
from that little gun.

35:36.830 --> 35:38.266
Maybe all your ammo!

35:40.355 --> 35:42.488
I have waited for this moment

35:42.531 --> 35:45.055
for six years!

35:46.318 --> 35:48.929
What you did to me

35:48.972 --> 35:52.193
after I welcomed you
into my home!

35:52.237 --> 35:53.412
My family!

35:55.631 --> 35:58.243
Did you really think
I would let this go?

35:59.940 --> 36:01.028
[chuckles]

36:01.071 --> 36:02.899
TORRES:
Well, you're gonna have to.

36:05.119 --> 36:07.382
Drop your weapon.

36:09.558 --> 36:11.212
Diaz, drop your weapon.

36:11.256 --> 36:13.301
[grunts]

36:40.285 --> 36:41.721
[lock beeps]

36:45.115 --> 36:47.248
[whispers]:
Maria?

36:47.292 --> 36:49.119
[door closes]

37:03.308 --> 37:05.571
He didn't knock twice.

37:05.614 --> 37:07.529
[chuckles softly]

37:13.274 --> 37:14.884
[gun slides]

37:21.108 --> 37:23.110
Come on. Come on.

37:28.855 --> 37:29.986
It's over.

37:31.988 --> 37:33.468
It's over.

37:38.821 --> 37:40.693
PARKER:
Looks like a shooting gallery.

37:40.736 --> 37:41.955
Yeah.

37:44.784 --> 37:46.351
[sighs]

37:46.394 --> 37:48.440
Any guests get caught
in the cross fire?

37:48.483 --> 37:50.703
Luckily, no, thanks to
the lockdown you ordered.

37:50.746 --> 37:53.053
I guess they won't be renting
out the fifth floor for a while.

37:53.096 --> 37:54.794
I just watched
the entire shoot-out

37:54.837 --> 37:56.491
on the hallway security cams.

37:56.535 --> 37:58.058
Nick's lucky he's alive.

37:58.101 --> 37:59.755
And Maria took out Silva?

37:59.799 --> 38:02.105
Shot him
with Torres's spare gun.

38:02.149 --> 38:03.716
Is Maria okay?

38:03.759 --> 38:06.806
Well, uh, Torres is
escorting her home as we speak.

38:06.849 --> 38:10.026
Yeah. I wonder how that's going.

38:13.726 --> 38:15.075
Wow,
you're really wasting no time

38:15.118 --> 38:16.685
in, uh, moving out of here, huh?

38:16.729 --> 38:19.297
You kidding me?
[scoffs softly]

38:19.340 --> 38:21.124
Adios, Anita.

38:21.168 --> 38:22.300
[chuckles]

38:25.041 --> 38:26.304
What?

38:26.347 --> 38:29.307
You standing there
in this house.

38:31.744 --> 38:34.790
For so long, I had this fantasy
of you walking through the door

38:34.834 --> 38:38.185
and us picking up
right where we left off.

38:39.621 --> 38:42.189
I really am so sorry, Maria.

38:42.232 --> 38:44.234
I know.

38:44.278 --> 38:46.585
If you're waiting
for forgiveness,

38:46.628 --> 38:48.717
I'm not there yet.[suitcase zips]

38:48.761 --> 38:51.154
I know.

38:51.198 --> 38:53.200
I understand
why you did what you did.

38:55.115 --> 38:57.160
You were in
an impossible position.

38:58.248 --> 39:01.251
Losing you was
the hardest moment of my life.

39:01.295 --> 39:02.688
Good.

39:02.731 --> 39:04.342
[chuckles softly]

39:05.386 --> 39:08.041
So, where you gonna go
now that you're free?

39:08.084 --> 39:10.870
I'm gonna stay
with my mom for a while.

39:10.913 --> 39:13.916
We have six birthdays
and Christmases to catch up on.

39:17.050 --> 39:19.182
And then?Honestly,

39:19.226 --> 39:21.010
I don't know
where I'm gonna live next.

39:21.054 --> 39:23.404
But wherever it is,
I'm gonna hang

39:23.448 --> 39:25.885
a lot of paintings.Good.

39:25.928 --> 39:27.756
Because when I saw
the bare walls yesterday,

39:27.800 --> 39:29.845
I, uh, couldn't believe
this was your home.

39:29.889 --> 39:31.412
It wasn't.

39:31.456 --> 39:33.283
It was Anita's.

39:33.327 --> 39:36.025
Yeah, and you let her sell
Maria's entire collection.

39:36.069 --> 39:37.462
No.

39:37.505 --> 39:39.812
I kept one.

39:39.855 --> 39:41.857
♪

39:46.906 --> 39:48.342
Remember this beauty?

39:48.386 --> 39:50.039
How can I forget?

39:50.083 --> 39:51.563
You kept my painting?

39:51.606 --> 39:53.565
Of course I did.

39:53.608 --> 39:56.524
It's not like I could sell it.

39:56.568 --> 39:59.005
This damn thing is hideous.

39:59.048 --> 40:01.616
Okay. I blame the teacher.

40:06.491 --> 40:09.798
From now on, you need anything,

40:09.842 --> 40:12.279
all you have to do is call.

40:14.020 --> 40:16.675
I promise

40:16.718 --> 40:19.068
I'll be there for you.

40:24.117 --> 40:26.119
This time, I...

40:27.686 --> 40:28.991
I believe you.

40:34.127 --> 40:36.085
Two days, two gunfights.

40:36.129 --> 40:37.870
You're still breathing.
You okay?

40:37.913 --> 40:39.306
Yeah.

40:39.349 --> 40:40.786
I'm used to it.

40:40.829 --> 40:42.918
After all this time,
it must feel great

40:42.962 --> 40:44.833
to make amends with Maria.

40:44.877 --> 40:49.185
It's kind of nice to finally
take someone out of my backpack.

40:49.229 --> 40:51.884
And I think we're gonna
be really good friends.

40:51.927 --> 40:54.190
Just friends?

40:54.234 --> 40:56.279
For now.

40:56.323 --> 40:58.281
Too much water under the bridge.

40:58.325 --> 41:00.458
I understand.

41:02.938 --> 41:04.940
You know, seeing her...

41:06.942 --> 41:09.945
...brought back
this-this feeling.

41:13.166 --> 41:16.125
It just made me
realize something.

41:17.170 --> 41:19.433
You want that feeling again?

41:19.477 --> 41:21.870
You deserve that, Nick.

41:23.872 --> 41:26.527
You do believe
you deserve that, right?

41:27.572 --> 41:28.964
No.

41:31.140 --> 41:33.752
Not yet.

41:33.795 --> 41:36.145
I got to get myself right first.

41:36.189 --> 41:38.626
How you gonna do that?

41:38.670 --> 41:41.020
By doing
what my father never did.

41:41.063 --> 41:42.978
Facing my demons head-on

41:43.022 --> 41:45.415
and becoming the man
that I want to be.

41:45.459 --> 41:47.592
The man he never was.

41:47.635 --> 41:50.246
[chuckles]: Well,
it sounds like the last few days

41:50.290 --> 41:53.336
have added up to about
a decade's worth of therapy.

41:53.380 --> 41:56.209
Well, you helped, too.

41:57.645 --> 42:00.126
With this newfound clarity,

42:00.169 --> 42:01.693
I'd like to ask you

42:01.736 --> 42:04.696
the question that I asked you
a couple of days ago.

42:04.739 --> 42:06.175
Mm.

42:08.656 --> 42:10.919
Do you want to be sober?

42:14.923 --> 42:16.882
Yes.

42:16.925 --> 42:19.406
But if my father
ever taught me anything,

42:19.449 --> 42:21.451
it's that words don't matter.

42:23.453 --> 42:25.847
Your word matters to me.

42:25.891 --> 42:29.198
If you tell me yes,
I believe you.

42:31.418 --> 42:33.681
You know it won't be easy.

42:35.683 --> 42:38.207
Nothing worth it ever is.
