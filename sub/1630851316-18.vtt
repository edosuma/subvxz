00:21.978 --> 00:23.893
Check it out.

00:25.677 --> 00:27.244
Like what you see?

00:27.288 --> 00:29.812
Hey, I got another carload
of merch arriving any sec.

00:29.855 --> 00:32.989
What about ammo?No, hardware only.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.166
This your boy now?

00:36.210 --> 00:37.907
No.

00:48.961 --> 00:52.922
Morning, boys. I see you're
still using the rest stop

00:52.965 --> 00:54.706
to do business.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.273
Diaz?

00:57.318 --> 00:59.059
You don't look
happy to see me.

00:59.102 --> 01:02.236
No, it's just that we heard
you got locked up.

01:02.279 --> 01:03.759
[laughs]

01:03.802 --> 01:05.761
You know, I got out
for good behavior.

01:07.589 --> 01:09.765
Open the door.

01:17.599 --> 01:20.471
Hello. Come out
and join us.

01:21.559 --> 01:24.171
Diaz, we didn't mean
to step on your territory.

01:24.214 --> 01:26.695
Take the guns. Take the money.

01:26.738 --> 01:30.873
Well, very kind of you,
but I've got plenty of both.

01:30.916 --> 01:33.919
What I want is information.

01:33.963 --> 01:36.096
So, the first one of you

01:36.139 --> 01:40.665
who tells me where I can find
Carlos Salazar doesn't die.

01:40.709 --> 01:43.668
I swear, I don't know
any Carlos...

01:44.843 --> 01:46.715
That jog your memory?

01:46.758 --> 01:48.630
Hmm? Still no?

01:51.023 --> 01:52.286
Take a good look.

01:54.157 --> 01:56.246
The only difference between him

01:56.290 --> 01:59.206
and a low-level
gunrunner like you

01:59.249 --> 02:01.599
is that six years ago,
he narced on me,

02:01.643 --> 02:03.732
and I went to prison.

02:03.775 --> 02:05.560
Now, I'm sure you can imagine

02:05.603 --> 02:07.301
I'd like to have a word
with him.

02:08.345 --> 02:10.565
I remember this guy.

02:10.608 --> 02:13.263
But I... but I haven't
seen him since, like...

02:13.307 --> 02:15.439
since you got arrested.

02:15.483 --> 02:17.180
It's like he just, poof,
disappeared.

02:17.224 --> 02:19.313
People don't disappear.

02:19.356 --> 02:21.097
[laughing]:
Please, Diaz.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.534
I... I have no reason to lie.

02:24.535 --> 02:26.407
You know, I believe you.

02:26.450 --> 02:28.452
[gunshot][groaning]

02:30.019 --> 02:31.847
Let's get out of here.

02:31.890 --> 02:33.892
[coughing]

02:37.418 --> 02:39.420
â™ª

03:11.452 --> 03:13.018
I think I might win.

03:13.062 --> 03:15.282
I think you're breaking a sweat.

03:15.325 --> 03:16.718
Small price for victory.

03:16.761 --> 03:18.720
Be careful talking and typing
at the same time.

03:18.763 --> 03:20.243
Might make a mistake.

03:20.287 --> 03:21.636
I don't make mistakes, McGee.

03:22.680 --> 03:25.335
Done. And print.

03:25.379 --> 03:26.858
[chuckling]

03:26.902 --> 03:27.946
[printer whirring]

03:27.990 --> 03:29.774
[clicks tongue]

03:33.169 --> 03:35.040
The king is dead.

03:37.129 --> 03:39.001
Presenting
my after action report.

03:39.044 --> 03:42.570
Please notice that it is
handed in before McGee.

03:42.613 --> 03:44.920
Thank you, Agent Knight,
but McGee beat you.

03:44.963 --> 03:46.051
What?

03:46.095 --> 03:47.444
How?

03:47.488 --> 03:49.054
PARKER:
He emailed me his report

03:49.098 --> 03:50.534
while you were
at the printer.

03:50.578 --> 03:52.014
Long live the king.

03:52.057 --> 03:53.320
Mm.

03:53.363 --> 03:55.235
Where's the
ballistics report?

03:55.278 --> 03:56.801
Torres is working on that.

03:56.845 --> 03:58.499
Well, not, uh,
right now, he's not.

03:58.542 --> 04:01.502
Seems that he's been, uh,
late Mondays recently.

04:01.545 --> 04:03.330
Right, late Mondays.

04:03.373 --> 04:05.245
Late Mondays.

04:05.288 --> 04:06.811
Late Mondays.

04:06.855 --> 04:08.422
So, Parker,

04:08.465 --> 04:10.206
McGee was wondering.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.294
Just me?

04:11.338 --> 04:13.253
We were wondering

04:13.296 --> 04:15.603
why Torres has been coming in
late these past few Mondays.

04:15.646 --> 04:18.345
Have no idea.
He gave me a heads-up,

04:18.388 --> 04:20.085
I said fine, end of story.

04:20.129 --> 04:22.262
[phone ringing]

04:22.305 --> 04:23.524
Pilates class?

04:23.567 --> 04:25.308
Animal shelter volunteer.

04:25.352 --> 04:27.049
Protein shake convention.

04:27.092 --> 04:28.877
Marine Corps weapons found

04:28.920 --> 04:30.574
at the scene
of a triple homicide.

04:30.618 --> 04:32.097
We'll call Torres
from the car,

04:32.141 --> 04:33.751
have him meet us there.

04:34.796 --> 04:36.450
GRACE: Are you sleeping
any better?

04:36.493 --> 04:38.147
No.

04:38.190 --> 04:40.367
And what do you feel
the problem is?

04:40.410 --> 04:42.325
Isn't that for you to tell me?

04:42.369 --> 04:44.893
Well, sure, but I need you
to work with me.

04:44.936 --> 04:49.332
Is your mind racing, or is your
sleep deprivation dream-related?

04:49.376 --> 04:51.378
Dream.

04:51.421 --> 04:53.205
Okay. Want to talk about it?

04:53.249 --> 04:54.598
No.

05:00.604 --> 05:04.347
My dad and I are riding
this upside-down roller coaster.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.610
It's a huge rush.

05:06.654 --> 05:10.788
And him and I are
both screaming,

05:10.832 --> 05:12.703
but in a good way.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.401
Sounds nice.

05:14.444 --> 05:16.533
Yeah, it would've been,
but it never happened.

05:16.577 --> 05:18.187
We never went
on a roller coaster together.

05:18.230 --> 05:21.016
We actually never went anywhere
together.

05:21.059 --> 05:23.888
Does your relationship
with your father torment you?

05:23.932 --> 05:25.368
I don't have a relationship
with my father.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.631
Is that hard on you?
No.

05:27.675 --> 05:29.720
Are you being honest
with yourself?

05:29.764 --> 05:31.331
Can we be done
with the questions,

05:31.374 --> 05:33.463
and can you skip to the part
where you give me the answers?

05:33.507 --> 05:36.336
I don't have all the answers.Then why am I here?

05:36.379 --> 05:38.120
Because you have
all the answers.

05:38.163 --> 05:39.817
I can help you find them.

05:39.861 --> 05:41.471
[laughing]:
Okay.

05:42.472 --> 05:44.431
But what I do know is

05:44.474 --> 05:49.349
that you store pieces of
your life in a mental backpack.

05:49.392 --> 05:52.700
And your dad's in there,
and your job

05:52.743 --> 05:54.528
and Bishop.

05:54.571 --> 05:56.791
That's an interesting theory.Yeah.

05:56.834 --> 05:58.793
It's called
compartmentalization.

05:58.836 --> 06:00.795
That's how you get
through your day.

06:00.838 --> 06:03.406
But eventually,
the backpack gets heavy,

06:03.450 --> 06:06.322
so heavy that you need help
carrying it.

06:06.366 --> 06:10.718
And recently,
that help has been 80-proof.

06:13.111 --> 06:15.375
Did you drink last night?

06:15.418 --> 06:16.985
And I'm not here
to judge you.

06:17.028 --> 06:18.421
I don't feel judged.

06:18.465 --> 06:19.770
What do you feel?

06:19.814 --> 06:21.772
Numb.

06:21.816 --> 06:24.819
Do you want to be sober,
Nicholas?

06:26.298 --> 06:28.300
[cell phone ringing]

06:33.523 --> 06:35.177
[clears throat]

06:35.220 --> 06:36.570
McGee.

06:36.613 --> 06:39.181
Yeah.

06:39.224 --> 06:40.878
Send me the address.

06:42.314 --> 06:43.620
I have to go to work.

06:48.582 --> 06:50.888
McGEE:
All right, what do we got?

06:50.932 --> 06:53.064
A big bag of cash.

06:53.108 --> 06:54.805
Approximately 20 grand.

06:54.849 --> 06:57.199
Ooh. It's enough
to remodel my kitchen.

06:57.242 --> 06:58.722
I'm thinking a trip to Greece.

06:58.766 --> 07:00.463
Eh, your fantasy's better.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.726
That wasn't vacation money.

07:02.770 --> 07:04.641
It was meant to buy these.

07:04.685 --> 07:06.338
Ah, heavy artillery.

07:06.382 --> 07:08.079
According to the
serial numbers,

07:08.123 --> 07:09.646
they were supposed
to be delivered

07:09.690 --> 07:11.474
to the armory at Quantico.KNIGHT: Oh.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.389
I'm thinking these guys
aren't in the Corps.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.391
Yeah,
you'd be thinking correctly.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.914
Fingerprints just came back.

07:16.958 --> 07:20.135
All three are in the system,
long rap sheets.

07:20.178 --> 07:22.180
Let me guess.
Weapons charges.

07:22.224 --> 07:25.096
So what are we thinking?
Black market gun deal gone bad?

07:25.140 --> 07:27.403
Well, these weapons
didn't kill 'em.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.491
How do you know?

07:28.535 --> 07:29.971
Well, the entry wounds
are too small.

07:30.014 --> 07:31.494
I'm guessing
that they were

07:31.538 --> 07:33.322
probably killed
by a small-caliber handgun.

07:33.365 --> 07:34.802
No handguns here.

07:34.845 --> 07:36.499
Killer probably
took it with him.

07:36.543 --> 07:39.284
But left behind the big guns
and bag of cash? Why?

07:39.328 --> 07:41.286
I may be able to answer that.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.375
Special Agent?Alden Parker.

07:43.419 --> 07:45.943
Trooper Phil Collins.
No relation.

07:45.987 --> 07:48.337
Bummer.
You got something for me?

07:48.380 --> 07:50.078
A witness.

07:50.121 --> 07:52.733
Travis Williams, 25.

07:52.776 --> 07:55.866
When I arrived, he was
performing CPR on the victims.

07:55.910 --> 07:57.520
Makes it tough,
you know?

07:57.564 --> 07:59.043
What does?

07:59.087 --> 08:00.523
Being named Phil Collins.

08:00.567 --> 08:04.048
All the comments.
Never even seen him perform.

08:04.092 --> 08:06.224
Where's the witness?

08:06.268 --> 08:08.400
My squad car, handcuffed.

08:08.444 --> 08:10.141
You arrested him? Why?

08:10.185 --> 08:11.795
Found crates of
weapons in his car.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.797
He's mixed up
in this somehow.

08:13.841 --> 08:15.582
Might even be
the triggerman.

08:15.625 --> 08:17.584
So your theory, Phil,

08:17.627 --> 08:20.369
is that, uh, he shot three guys,

08:20.412 --> 08:22.502
then stayed behind
to save their lives?

08:23.590 --> 08:25.505
Criminals are stupid.

08:28.290 --> 08:29.421
Travis?

08:29.465 --> 08:31.293
They're all dead?

08:31.336 --> 08:32.555
Yeah, afraid so.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.209
Here. Step out of here
for a second.

08:35.819 --> 08:39.257
The ambulance--
it took forever to get here.

08:39.301 --> 08:41.259
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

08:41.303 --> 08:44.393
Um, they friends of yours?

08:45.655 --> 08:48.615
You part of this gun deal?

08:48.658 --> 08:50.921
But I didn't kill them.

08:50.965 --> 08:52.575
But you know who did, don't you?

08:52.619 --> 08:54.098
I'm not going there.

08:54.142 --> 08:55.709
The guy who did this
is a psycho.

08:55.752 --> 08:57.101
He's a straight-up killer.

08:57.145 --> 08:59.103
Then why didn't he shoot you?

08:59.147 --> 09:00.714
I was parked off to the side,

09:00.757 --> 09:03.107
waiting to bring in more
inventory. He didn't see me.

09:03.151 --> 09:04.674
Well, if he didn't see you,

09:04.718 --> 09:06.850
then he doesn't know
you're talking to us, does he?

09:08.939 --> 09:10.680
Do you know
who Reymundo Diaz is?

09:10.724 --> 09:12.290
The gun smuggler?

09:12.334 --> 09:13.857
He didn't do this.
He's in prison.

09:13.901 --> 09:15.642
I thought that, too.

09:15.685 --> 09:18.035
But I just watched him
shoot my friends.

09:18.079 --> 09:21.691
Okay, let's say it was him. Why?

09:21.735 --> 09:24.346
I overheard him saying he was
looking for some gunrunner

09:24.389 --> 09:26.478
we used to know--
Carlos Salazar.

09:26.522 --> 09:28.393
Who's Carlos Salazar?

09:31.005 --> 09:32.833
Him.

09:33.877 --> 09:35.792
Hey, Trav.

09:37.272 --> 09:39.100
Long time no see.

09:45.802 --> 09:48.457
PARKER:
Reymundo Diaz. Six years ago,

09:48.500 --> 09:51.242
he was the biggest gun smuggler
in North America.

09:51.286 --> 09:52.940
I remember him.

09:52.983 --> 09:54.985
He supplied weapons
to the Mexican drug cartels.

09:55.029 --> 09:57.466
Yeah, a lot
of those weapons were stolen

09:57.509 --> 09:59.337
from the U.S. military.

09:59.381 --> 10:01.557
I seem to recall that
you took him down, Agent Torres.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.907
It was a joint ATF-NCIS op.

10:03.951 --> 10:06.475
I went undercover
as Carlos Salazar.

10:06.518 --> 10:08.172
How'd you get
in his inner circle?

10:10.087 --> 10:12.307
Through his cousin, Maria.

10:13.351 --> 10:15.310
She wasn't in the gun business,

10:15.353 --> 10:17.704
but she and Diaz
were very close.

10:17.747 --> 10:20.358
They would get together
every Sunday for family dinners.

10:20.402 --> 10:23.666
I posed as Salazar,
and we started dating.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.276
ALL:
Amen.

10:26.713 --> 10:29.150
So, a toast

10:29.193 --> 10:31.674
to Maria and Carlos.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.589
TORRES:
I would see him
every Sunday night.

10:33.633 --> 10:37.549
Took a while, but eventually,
I earned his trust.

10:37.593 --> 10:39.160
He cut me in on a few deals,

10:39.203 --> 10:41.641
and that was the only evidence
I needed to take him down.

10:41.684 --> 10:44.731
Then he was deported to Mexico
to serve a life sentence.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.210
So, how is he out?

10:46.254 --> 10:48.909
PARKER:
A million-dollar bribe
to the guards.

10:48.952 --> 10:51.172
36 hours ago, according
to the prison warden.

10:51.215 --> 10:54.088
So, in other words,
a convicted killer

10:54.131 --> 10:57.134
with access to serious firepower
is hunting you.

10:57.178 --> 11:00.224
No, not me. Carlos Salazar.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.270
He never found out
I was a fed.

11:02.313 --> 11:04.620
He's looking for a ghost.For now.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.927
If he's killing people
to find you,

11:06.970 --> 11:08.755
probably won't be long
until he does.

11:08.798 --> 11:10.931
[cell phone chimes]Then we better find him first.

11:11.975 --> 11:13.542
Kasie.

11:18.765 --> 11:21.071
Oh, Nick, I need you.

11:21.115 --> 11:23.117
Do you remember all the guys
in Diaz's crew?

11:23.160 --> 11:24.553
Most of them, yeah.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.076
Okay, look through
these photos.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.469
Let me know if you
recognize anyone.

11:27.512 --> 11:28.557
What am I looking at?

11:28.600 --> 11:30.211
The Camargo Bridge
border crossing

11:30.254 --> 11:32.648
in Rio Grande City, Texas.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.129
I think it's where
Diaz entered the U.S.

11:35.172 --> 11:36.739
What makes you think that?Shush.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.306
Don't distract him.

11:38.349 --> 11:39.873
Okay, he needs
to concentrate.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.658
But allow me to walk you
through the process.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.921
Diaz walked out of this prison

11:44.965 --> 11:47.054
two nights ago at 10:30 p.m.

11:47.097 --> 11:49.317
33 hours later,
he killed three people

11:49.360 --> 11:51.014
at a Virginia rest stop.

11:51.058 --> 11:52.363
He had to cross the border.

11:52.407 --> 11:54.235
Kasie, not to throw
a wet towel on this,

11:54.278 --> 11:56.759
but there are over 300
ports of entry into the U.S.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.979
Alden, not to throw
a wet towel

11:59.022 --> 12:00.632
over your wet towel,

12:00.676 --> 12:03.723
but I've already narrowed down
the list of possibilities.

12:03.766 --> 12:06.116
Diaz's passport was revoked,
so he couldn't fly.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.770
He could have got a fake I.D.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.163
No, Diaz is too famous to walk

12:09.206 --> 12:10.468
through an airport
without getting caught.

12:10.512 --> 12:13.123
So, you think he went by car.

12:13.167 --> 12:14.777
I do.

12:14.821 --> 12:17.040
His prison is in Nuevo LeÃ³n.

12:17.084 --> 12:19.390
It's a straight shot
north into Texas.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.392
Lot of border crossings
in Texas.

12:21.436 --> 12:23.394
Well, 28, to be exact,

12:23.438 --> 12:26.571
but with the Mexican police
on his ass, I am guessing

12:26.615 --> 12:28.312
he picked the closest one.

12:28.356 --> 12:30.184
Camargo Bridge?

12:30.227 --> 12:32.229
It's a four-hour drive
from the prison.

12:32.273 --> 12:35.102
I pulled the photos
from all the cars

12:35.145 --> 12:37.191
that drove into the U.S.
between 2:00

12:37.234 --> 12:39.323
and 3:00 a.m. yesterday.But you said so yourself,

12:39.367 --> 12:41.151
the border guards
would've recognized him.

12:41.195 --> 12:43.197
Not if he was hiding
in the trunk.

12:45.373 --> 12:47.070
Those are Diaz's guys.

12:47.114 --> 12:49.638
I don't remember
the passenger's name,

12:49.681 --> 12:51.248
but the driver,
I'll never forget.

12:51.292 --> 12:52.815
RenÃ© Romero.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.208
He goes by Renny.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.036
PARKER:
Sounds like you have a history.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.821
Yeah, you can say that.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.562
He tried to kill me.

13:00.605 --> 13:02.738
Ooh. I really want to hear
that story,

13:02.782 --> 13:04.174
but it'll have to wait.

13:04.218 --> 13:06.350
Renny's got a record.

13:06.394 --> 13:09.266
And I've got
the last known address.

13:11.051 --> 13:13.053
This guy Diaz
must really hate you.

13:13.096 --> 13:15.446
He hates Salazar, not me.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.927
That's right.
I read the report.

13:17.971 --> 13:20.234
You played Salazar
for five months.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.540
That's a long time
to be somebody else.

13:22.584 --> 13:23.933
Yep.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.239
What was it like?

13:25.282 --> 13:26.980
Come on, McGee.

13:27.023 --> 13:28.633
You know what it's like.

13:28.677 --> 13:30.374
You've done it before.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.333
Yeah, but not for that long.

13:32.376 --> 13:34.639
Plus, I never dated a mark.

13:37.207 --> 13:39.688
You two must have gotten close.

13:39.731 --> 13:42.212
â™ª

13:43.953 --> 13:45.781
TORRES:
As close as I needed to be.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.261
McGEE:
What was she like?

13:48.653 --> 13:51.308
TORRES:
She was a...

13:51.352 --> 13:54.181
She was a mark.Well,

13:54.224 --> 13:56.139
whatever you did
must have worked.

13:57.140 --> 13:59.142
She testified against Diaz.

14:00.361 --> 14:03.146
How'd you convince her
to flip on her own cousin?

14:04.191 --> 14:05.801
I made her a promise.

14:07.803 --> 14:09.936
I told her I'd join her
in witness protection

14:09.979 --> 14:12.808
and that we'd live
happily ever after.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.681
Wow.Yeah.

14:16.725 --> 14:19.510
It was the only way that I could
get her to testify against Diaz.

14:19.554 --> 14:23.123
So, she flipped on Diaz,
you flipped on her?

14:23.166 --> 14:25.342
I did what I had to do.

14:26.822 --> 14:28.606
[gunshot]

14:28.650 --> 14:30.434
[tires squealing]

14:30.478 --> 14:32.784
You hit?No, no, no.
Go get him. Go get him.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.661
Wait, is that Renny,
the guy we're supposed to see?

14:39.704 --> 14:41.750
Yeah.
Guess he came to see us first.

14:45.623 --> 14:46.929
Hold on.

15:08.777 --> 15:09.996
What up, Renny?

15:10.039 --> 15:12.041
Hey, Carlos.

15:13.434 --> 15:15.218
Or should I say Nick?

15:15.262 --> 15:18.265
Guess Diaz isn't chasing
a ghost anymore.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.452
That's twice.

15:31.495 --> 15:33.845
That's twice
that you tried to kill me.

15:33.889 --> 15:35.195
But hey,

15:35.238 --> 15:36.631
I'm still standing.

15:37.675 --> 15:40.113
What is that, oh for two?

15:40.156 --> 15:42.028
[sighs]
Come on, man.

15:42.071 --> 15:44.291
That first time
was a misunderstanding.

15:44.334 --> 15:46.946
[chuckles]And today...

15:46.989 --> 15:48.773
You should know,

15:48.817 --> 15:51.515
when Diaz gives an order,
you do it.

15:51.559 --> 15:55.128
The old "My gunrunning boss
made me do it" excuse.

15:55.171 --> 15:57.391
Probably won't play
well with the jury.

15:58.653 --> 16:01.438
Speaking of the boss,
where is he?

16:01.482 --> 16:03.658
I have no idea.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.269
Well, that is too bad.

16:06.313 --> 16:09.055
Renny, I guess you're gonna have
to take the rap by yourself.

16:09.098 --> 16:12.145
Attempted murder
of two federal agents?

16:12.188 --> 16:13.798
[chuckles]:
That's 25 to life.

16:13.842 --> 16:15.365
[door opens]

16:15.409 --> 16:16.976
Hold up.

16:19.065 --> 16:20.892
What do you want to know?

16:26.768 --> 16:28.291
How'd you find me?

16:28.335 --> 16:30.511
I didn't. Diaz did.

16:30.554 --> 16:32.034
How?

16:32.078 --> 16:34.471
If you kill enough people,

16:34.515 --> 16:36.256
you can find out anything.

16:36.299 --> 16:39.346
KNIGHT:So, Diaz discovered
his real identity

16:39.389 --> 16:41.522
and then ordered you
to hang out at the naval yard

16:41.565 --> 16:42.827
until you saw him?

16:42.871 --> 16:44.786
And then kill him, yeah.

16:44.829 --> 16:46.701
Where is he now?

16:46.744 --> 16:48.746
I don't know.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.792
What's his next gun deal?

16:50.835 --> 16:52.620
[sighs]
I don't know that, either.

16:52.663 --> 16:53.882
KNIGHT:
Come on, Renny.

16:53.925 --> 16:55.318
You spent two days
in a car with him

16:55.362 --> 16:56.798
driving from Mexico
to Virginia.

16:56.841 --> 16:58.191
What did you talk about?

16:59.235 --> 17:00.367
Him.

17:00.410 --> 17:03.283
Diaz said
he's getting rid of the rats

17:03.326 --> 17:06.155
who sent him to prison.

17:06.199 --> 17:08.853
"Rats"? Plural?

17:08.897 --> 17:10.681
Yeah.

17:10.725 --> 17:13.597
You and his cousin Maria.

17:14.816 --> 17:16.818
He's never gonna find her.

17:18.211 --> 17:21.040
He found you, didn't he?

17:25.957 --> 17:27.350
[door closes]

17:27.394 --> 17:29.091
I think you pissed him off.

17:30.136 --> 17:32.442
I think I scared him.

17:36.490 --> 17:37.882
We need to warn Maria.

17:37.926 --> 17:39.406
She's in witness protection.

17:39.449 --> 17:40.929
I know where she is.

17:40.972 --> 17:43.105
I mean, I don't know where
she is, but I should.

17:43.149 --> 17:45.847
No, you shouldn't.
No one should.

17:45.890 --> 17:49.546
Please, Director.
I need to know that she's safe.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.509
All right.[phone beeps]

17:55.552 --> 17:57.119
[knock on door]

17:58.468 --> 17:59.817
Have a seat.

17:59.861 --> 18:02.081
I'm Agent Parker.
This is Agent Torres.

18:02.124 --> 18:04.170
Thanks for meeting with us.

18:04.213 --> 18:06.085
Happy to do it.
I'm Deputy Marshal Carter.

18:06.128 --> 18:07.608
This is Deputy Marshal Wright.

18:07.651 --> 18:10.263
So, we understand
that Reymundo Diaz

18:10.306 --> 18:12.830
bought his way out of prison
and is in the U.S.

18:12.874 --> 18:15.746
Then you also understand
that Maria Diaz is in danger.

18:15.790 --> 18:16.834
No, she isn't.

18:16.878 --> 18:19.010
She's safe, I can assure you.

18:19.054 --> 18:20.142
How do you know that?

18:20.186 --> 18:21.230
WRIGHT:
Because protecting people

18:21.274 --> 18:22.231
is what we do.

18:22.275 --> 18:23.711
We're pros.

18:23.754 --> 18:25.713
So is Diaz.

18:25.756 --> 18:27.671
When was the last time
you spoke to her?

18:27.715 --> 18:29.673
A few days ago.How many? Two? Three?

18:29.717 --> 18:30.892
More like a week.

18:30.935 --> 18:32.241
That's more than a few.

18:32.285 --> 18:34.156
We tried to call her
on our way here,

18:34.200 --> 18:35.505
but we got her voice mail.

18:35.549 --> 18:37.725
That-that's not atypical.

18:37.768 --> 18:38.987
She values her privacy.

18:39.030 --> 18:40.771
If she's not answering,
why are you not

18:40.815 --> 18:42.599
sending somebody
to go check on her?

18:42.643 --> 18:44.166
CARTER:Look,

18:44.210 --> 18:46.342
I know you're concerned, but
she's got a new identity.

18:46.386 --> 18:47.865
She lives in a
different state.

18:47.909 --> 18:49.998
I promise you, Diaz
will never find her.

18:50.041 --> 18:52.479
You kill enough people,

18:52.522 --> 18:54.524
you can find out anything.

18:57.353 --> 18:58.920
Diaz killed those three men

18:58.963 --> 19:00.313
trying to find me.

19:00.356 --> 19:01.662
He found me.

19:01.705 --> 19:03.838
Diaz tried to have
Agent Torres killed

19:03.881 --> 19:07.015
this morning, and we think
he's going after Maria next.

19:08.582 --> 19:10.497
Where is she?

19:13.152 --> 19:14.544
Maryland.

19:15.850 --> 19:19.114
So, who's driving? You or us?

19:19.158 --> 19:20.681
McGEE:
Okay.

19:20.724 --> 19:22.465
All right, well, the minute
you hear anything, let us know.

19:22.509 --> 19:23.684
We'll do the same.

19:23.727 --> 19:25.686
Well, that was ATF.

19:25.729 --> 19:27.731
It is radio silence out there.

19:27.775 --> 19:30.647
No chatter on Diaz
or any potential gun deals.

19:30.691 --> 19:32.606
That's because he's not making
a gun deal.

19:32.649 --> 19:33.998
How's that?

19:34.042 --> 19:35.348
I kept grilling Renny.

19:35.391 --> 19:37.785
He said that Diaz
is out of the gun business.

19:37.828 --> 19:39.613
Yesterday, Diaz sent Renny

19:39.656 --> 19:42.572
to a shady pharmacy in Culpeper
to pick up some pills.

19:42.616 --> 19:44.008
What kind of pills?

19:44.052 --> 19:46.272
Renny doesn't know.
But he said, whatever they were,

19:46.315 --> 19:48.404
Diaz was looking
to buy a lot more.

19:48.448 --> 19:50.798
Well, if Diaz is switching
from dealing guns to drugs,

19:50.841 --> 19:52.626
that would make sense
why every lead

19:52.669 --> 19:54.454
we've followed so far
has been a dead end.

19:54.497 --> 19:56.978
Not anymore.
We find that drug deal,

19:57.021 --> 19:58.849
we find Diaz. [knock on door]

19:59.894 --> 20:01.852
WRIGHT: Hello?[knock on door]

20:01.896 --> 20:03.463
Anyone home?

20:05.987 --> 20:07.510
It's your friend John.

20:07.554 --> 20:09.120
Coming to check on you.

20:16.302 --> 20:18.521
Are you sure this is her place?

20:18.565 --> 20:20.306
Yeah, I'm sure. Why?

20:23.918 --> 20:26.094
TORRES:
Because she's an artist.

20:26.137 --> 20:28.139
What happened
to all her paintings?

20:29.706 --> 20:31.186
Maria Diaz was an artist.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.883
Anita Reyes couldn't be.

20:32.927 --> 20:34.276
When she assumed
her new identity,

20:34.320 --> 20:35.973
she had to change careers.

20:36.017 --> 20:37.236
Art world's
a small community.

20:37.279 --> 20:38.628
She would've risked
being exposed.

20:39.673 --> 20:41.065
What does she do now?

20:42.066 --> 20:43.546
Telemarketing.

20:46.723 --> 20:48.290
What about her paintings?

20:49.378 --> 20:51.859
She sold them.
Needed the money.

20:53.208 --> 20:54.688
PARKER:
Back here.

20:58.605 --> 21:00.520
Looks like blood to me.

21:00.563 --> 21:02.086
There's a bullet hole
in the wall.

21:04.828 --> 21:07.483
You're pros, huh? You were
supposed to protect her, man!All right, Torres. Nick!

21:07.527 --> 21:09.529
That's enough! Okay?You need to control your man.

21:09.572 --> 21:11.139
You need to shut up and listen.

21:11.182 --> 21:13.446
We need another safe house. Now.

21:13.489 --> 21:15.012
Well, once we find Maria,
I'll arrange

21:15.056 --> 21:17.058
a secure location.Not for Maria. For him.

21:17.101 --> 21:19.321
Parker, I'm not going anywhere.Yes, you are.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.801
Diaz knows your identity.

21:20.844 --> 21:23.151
He found this house,
he can find yours,

21:23.194 --> 21:24.587
which means
you're not staying here,

21:24.631 --> 21:26.372
and you're not going home.

21:26.415 --> 21:28.287
Where's he going?

21:29.375 --> 21:31.028
There's a hotel nearby
that we've used before.

21:31.072 --> 21:32.465
I'll see if it's available.

21:32.508 --> 21:33.640
Make it available.

21:34.728 --> 21:37.339
Go to the hotel.
Get some rest.

21:37.383 --> 21:39.123
I'll process
this house tonight.

21:39.167 --> 21:40.734
We'll start fresh
in the morning.

21:46.827 --> 21:49.133
GRACE [on speakerphone]:
Nick, you okay?

21:49.177 --> 21:50.918
Yeah, all good.

21:50.961 --> 21:53.312
I don't think you called me
at 11:00 at night

21:53.355 --> 21:55.357
to tell me you're all good.

21:55.401 --> 21:57.533
Then why did I call you?

21:57.577 --> 21:59.840
Well, I don't know,
but I have to say

21:59.883 --> 22:02.799
that you don't sound
like yourself tonight.

22:02.843 --> 22:04.540
Well, it's me.

22:04.584 --> 22:06.412
Let me be more direct.

22:06.455 --> 22:08.414
You don't sound sober.

22:09.893 --> 22:11.330
I'm not.

22:11.373 --> 22:13.332
And-and that's okay.

22:13.375 --> 22:16.509
It's about progress,
not perfection.

22:16.552 --> 22:19.120
What's important
is that you're being honest.

22:19.163 --> 22:20.730
Honest?

22:20.774 --> 22:24.299
I honestly want to put my fist
through the damn wall.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.519
What happened?

22:28.999 --> 22:31.741
I guess my backpack
got too heavy.

22:31.785 --> 22:34.135
More specific, Nick.

22:34.178 --> 22:37.312
I heard that you and Tim
got shot at today,

22:37.356 --> 22:39.488
and I can't imagine
how terrifying that must be.

22:39.532 --> 22:41.577
Yeah, I'm used to that.

22:41.621 --> 22:43.492
Then what is it?

22:44.493 --> 22:46.495
â™ª

22:52.936 --> 22:54.895
My dad.

22:54.938 --> 22:56.331
Your dream?

22:56.375 --> 22:57.767
My nightmare.

22:59.247 --> 23:01.771
My whole life, I've tried
to be nothing like my father.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.689
And now I'm thinking
that maybe I am him.

23:07.734 --> 23:09.518
Why?

23:09.562 --> 23:11.999
Because I abandoned someone.

23:14.044 --> 23:16.656
Someone I really cared about.

23:16.699 --> 23:18.266
If that choice

23:18.309 --> 23:19.876
is weighing on you,

23:19.920 --> 23:21.878
I suggest you make amends.

23:23.489 --> 23:24.838
Yeah, it's too late.

23:24.881 --> 23:27.057
Well, I will say this.

23:27.101 --> 23:29.103
The choice you made[elevator bell dings
in distance]

23:29.146 --> 23:30.583
does not make you your dad.

23:30.626 --> 23:33.063
You are not your father.

23:34.108 --> 23:35.283
Hello? Nick?

23:35.326 --> 23:37.067
I got to go.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.421
â™ª

24:02.658 --> 24:04.094
Maria.

24:04.138 --> 24:05.879
Nice to see you, too.

24:25.681 --> 24:28.379
I thought you were dead.I thought so, too.

24:28.423 --> 24:29.598
Diaz must have found me,

24:29.642 --> 24:31.295
because he sent one of
his guys to kill me.

24:31.339 --> 24:33.472
Yeah, I went to your house
to warn you.

24:34.603 --> 24:36.387
I saw the blood.

24:36.431 --> 24:38.955
Where are you hit?I wasn't.

24:38.999 --> 24:40.827
He was.

24:40.870 --> 24:43.786
I keep a knife under my bed,
so when he tried to attack me,

24:43.830 --> 24:45.658
I sliced his arm.

24:45.701 --> 24:47.703
Did you recognize him?

24:47.747 --> 24:50.314
He was wearing a mask.

24:50.358 --> 24:51.707
He shot at me but missed,

24:51.751 --> 24:53.448
so I-I ran like hell
out of there.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.450
[breathes shakily]

24:55.494 --> 24:57.147
How'd you find me?

24:58.192 --> 25:00.020
I wasn't looking for you.

25:00.063 --> 25:03.023
I needed another safe house,
so I called Marshal Carter

25:03.066 --> 25:05.852
at WITSEC, and she told me
this was the closest place.

25:05.895 --> 25:08.594
You're the last person
I wanted to go to.

25:10.596 --> 25:12.772
But my options
were limited.

25:17.428 --> 25:19.213
You changed your hair.

25:21.258 --> 25:22.912
Yeah.

25:23.957 --> 25:25.915
Well,

25:25.959 --> 25:28.352
for what it's worth, um...

25:28.396 --> 25:30.006
I like it.

25:32.618 --> 25:35.142
You got something different
going on, too.

25:35.185 --> 25:36.447
Yeah.

25:36.491 --> 25:38.319
What do you think?

25:38.362 --> 25:40.060
Meh.

25:41.757 --> 25:43.672
I knew Carlos Salazar

25:43.716 --> 25:45.500
drank alone.

25:45.544 --> 25:48.938
But I guess
Nick Torres does, too.

25:48.982 --> 25:50.723
You mind?

25:54.117 --> 25:56.467
The marshals didn't call you?

25:56.511 --> 25:58.252
I'm sure they tried,

25:58.295 --> 26:00.994
but I turned off my phone
so Diaz wouldn't track me.

26:01.037 --> 26:02.865
I'm using the room's phone.

26:02.909 --> 26:04.650
What are you doing?I'm calling the marshals

26:04.693 --> 26:06.303
so they can come get you.

26:06.347 --> 26:07.304
I wouldn't bother.

26:07.348 --> 26:08.654
Why's that?

26:08.697 --> 26:10.786
Because by the time
they get here, I'll be gone.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.353
What are you talking about?[hangs up phone]

26:12.396 --> 26:14.616
I'm not going back
into witness protection.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.749
Look, they'll
relocate you, okay?

26:16.792 --> 26:18.011
And this time,
there will be agents

26:18.054 --> 26:19.273
outside the door.
I'll make sure of it.

26:19.316 --> 26:20.622
You're not hearing me, Nick.

26:20.666 --> 26:22.668
I'm not gonna live
like that anymore.

26:22.711 --> 26:23.712
Live like what?

26:23.756 --> 26:25.192
Like someone I'm not.

26:26.759 --> 26:29.675
WITSEC wasn't
happily ever after.

26:33.156 --> 26:35.028
I understand.

26:35.071 --> 26:37.073
But Diaz found you once.

26:37.117 --> 26:39.119
He will find you again.

26:39.162 --> 26:40.642
You have no choice.

26:40.686 --> 26:42.252
There is always a choice.

26:42.296 --> 26:44.211
And when I ran
from that house,

26:44.254 --> 26:46.648
I made the choice
to leave Anita Reyes behind.

26:46.692 --> 26:49.216
This is no time
to take a stand, Maria.

26:50.217 --> 26:52.698
You have a target
on your back.

26:52.741 --> 26:54.656
You're not safe.

26:57.093 --> 26:59.661
I feel pretty safe right now.

27:06.102 --> 27:07.669
McGEE:
So, where's Torres?

27:07.713 --> 27:10.063
Still at the hotel.With Maria?

27:10.106 --> 27:11.368
Yep.Oof.

27:11.412 --> 27:12.892
That's a whole lot
of baggage to unpack.

27:12.935 --> 27:14.154
[sighs]
Yep.

27:15.198 --> 27:16.678
So, Vance just told me

27:16.722 --> 27:19.159
that Maria showed up
at Nick's hotel room last night.

27:19.202 --> 27:21.204
Has anyone heard from him
this morning?

27:21.248 --> 27:22.641
Not yet. Why?

27:22.684 --> 27:25.513
You know, six years
is a lot of baggage to unpack.

27:25.556 --> 27:27.167
Yeah.Yeah.

27:27.210 --> 27:28.559
Well, I'm just happy
they're both off the grid

27:28.603 --> 27:30.518
and out of Diaz's reach.McGEE:
Speaking of Diaz,

27:30.561 --> 27:33.129
you figure out
exactly what drug he's moving?

27:33.173 --> 27:36.916
I called Happy's Pharmacy to ask
what pills Diaz's guy picked up.

27:36.959 --> 27:39.005
They wouldn't talk.
So then I went to Happy's

27:39.048 --> 27:41.094
last night
posing as a pillhead,

27:41.137 --> 27:42.704
and when they sold me
the oxys,

27:42.748 --> 27:44.445
I flashed my badge,

27:44.488 --> 27:45.925
and then they
wouldn't stop talking to me.

27:45.968 --> 27:47.448
So, what is he dealing?

27:47.491 --> 27:48.928
Percocet? Fentanyl?

27:48.971 --> 27:50.581
Not even close.

27:51.974 --> 27:55.369
Perpexofal XR.KNIGHT:
It's used to treat

27:55.412 --> 27:57.545
acute myeloid leukemia,

27:57.588 --> 28:00.330
a rare and very deadly form
of cancer.

28:00.374 --> 28:02.332
Is there any demand
for this Perpexofal

28:02.376 --> 28:03.725
on the black market?

28:03.769 --> 28:04.726
Nope.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.859
So why would Diaz want that?

28:06.902 --> 28:08.382
I called the Mexican
prison warden,

28:08.425 --> 28:10.079
and he didn't give any details,

28:10.123 --> 28:12.647
but he did say
that Diaz is very sick.

28:14.214 --> 28:17.391
If Diaz is dying, that explains
why our arms dealer

28:17.434 --> 28:19.088
isn't dealing any arms.

28:19.132 --> 28:21.177
He doesn't care about money.
He wants revenge.

28:21.221 --> 28:22.744
And there's nothing
more dangerous

28:22.788 --> 28:25.573
than a killer
with nothing to lose.

28:31.405 --> 28:33.189
Morning, sunshine.

28:33.233 --> 28:35.017
Buenos dÃ­as.

28:35.061 --> 28:36.410
How'd you sleep?

28:36.453 --> 28:40.588
Honestly,
the best I have in years.

28:40.631 --> 28:43.199
Well, that's good to hear,
'cause I slept like crap.

28:43.243 --> 28:45.767
[chuckles]: I told you
the chair wasn't necessary.

28:45.811 --> 28:48.291
But given how loud
you still snore,

28:48.335 --> 28:50.076
it was probably
for the best.

28:50.119 --> 28:51.773
What? I don't snore.

28:51.817 --> 28:55.255
Carlos Salazar used to say
the same thing six years ago.

28:56.604 --> 28:58.649
Carlos used to say
a lot of things.

28:59.694 --> 29:00.913
You should get dressed.

29:00.956 --> 29:03.306
My sweater's bloody.

29:03.350 --> 29:05.918
I have an extra
hoodie for you.

29:05.961 --> 29:08.224
Okay. And then what?

29:08.268 --> 29:11.227
And then I call
NCIS protection detail.

29:11.271 --> 29:13.403
And when they show up,

29:13.447 --> 29:17.233
I'll leave
and help my team find Diaz.

29:19.366 --> 29:20.759
What?

29:20.802 --> 29:22.195
Nothing.

29:23.631 --> 29:25.981
I mean, I guess
I shouldn't be surprised

29:26.025 --> 29:28.288
since leaving is your specialty.

29:31.595 --> 29:34.555
Room service menu is
over here on the table.

29:34.598 --> 29:36.426
So just order
whatever you want.

29:36.470 --> 29:38.820
Five months
we spent together,

29:38.864 --> 29:41.040
and it was nothing
but one big lie.

29:41.083 --> 29:42.693
What do you want me to say?

29:42.737 --> 29:43.912
Hmm?

29:43.956 --> 29:45.784
I had a job to do.So did I.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.220
I was an artist.

29:47.263 --> 29:49.048
I had a life
before you ruined it.

29:49.091 --> 29:51.267
Well, you couldn't live
that life. You were in danger.

29:51.311 --> 29:52.965
Danger you put me in.

29:53.008 --> 29:55.184
You could have chosen
a hundred ways to get to Diaz,

29:55.228 --> 29:56.577
but you chose me.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.622
That was the assignment.

29:59.623 --> 30:01.930
That's all I was?

30:01.974 --> 30:03.976
An assignment?

30:06.456 --> 30:09.372
It sucks. I know.

30:09.416 --> 30:11.026
But in a twisted way,

30:11.070 --> 30:12.636
you should be
proud of yourself.

30:13.681 --> 30:16.858
You helped send a
killer to prison.

30:16.902 --> 30:19.513
I feel like I've been
in one, too.

30:19.556 --> 30:22.211
Witness protection was necessary
to save your life.

30:22.255 --> 30:24.300
[laughs]:
What life?

30:24.344 --> 30:26.302
Anita Reyes,
the telemarketer?

30:26.346 --> 30:27.826
Living alone in Maryland?

30:27.869 --> 30:29.218
Thanks,

30:29.262 --> 30:31.830
but that life
wasn't worth saving.

30:41.796 --> 30:43.972
I'm sorry, Maria.

30:44.016 --> 30:45.887
Sure, you are.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.324
I am.

30:49.673 --> 30:51.893
What I did was unforgivable.

30:51.937 --> 30:53.329
Don't patronize me.

30:53.373 --> 30:54.809
I know
you were following orders,

30:54.853 --> 30:56.985
and I know I'm not the only mark
you played.

30:58.073 --> 31:00.597
You were the only
mark I cared about.

31:00.641 --> 31:02.904
You think it was easy

31:02.948 --> 31:04.775
walking away

31:04.819 --> 31:07.866
knowing how much pain I caused?

31:07.909 --> 31:10.303
Well, believe it or not...

31:17.963 --> 31:20.226
...I'm sorry.

31:20.269 --> 31:22.054
Six years ago,

31:22.097 --> 31:24.665
I was just collateral damage.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.842
That's how you saw me.

31:29.235 --> 31:30.845
So, what changed?

31:32.107 --> 31:35.110
Why are you
apologizing now?

31:38.287 --> 31:41.247
This happened to you, didn't it?

31:42.901 --> 31:45.077
Someone you cared about
left you.

31:50.038 --> 31:52.127
What was her name?

31:55.130 --> 31:57.089
The guy who attacked you.

31:57.132 --> 31:58.786
You remember
anything about him?

31:58.829 --> 32:01.136
What was he wearing?
How tall was he?

32:02.181 --> 32:04.835
Wearing black.
About your height.

32:05.880 --> 32:08.187
You know, actually,
I-I did see

32:08.230 --> 32:10.363
he had a tattoo
on his left hand.

32:10.406 --> 32:12.365
Of a gun?Yeah.

32:12.408 --> 32:13.975
How'd you know?

32:17.152 --> 32:18.458
Do you remember him?

32:20.112 --> 32:21.896
That's Pablo Silva.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.550
Do you know where his house is?

32:23.593 --> 32:26.553
Back when I knew him,
his house was on wheels.

32:31.297 --> 32:32.820
[horse neighing in distance]

32:34.953 --> 32:37.999
NCIS!Pablo Silva!

32:39.435 --> 32:41.524
Look.

32:46.094 --> 32:48.009
McGEE:
That's not Silva.

32:48.053 --> 32:50.229
Whoever it is, looks like
they beat him to death.

32:50.272 --> 32:52.144
I'll check for an I.D.

32:52.187 --> 32:53.710
Don't bother.

32:53.754 --> 32:55.669
His name is
Marshal John Wright.

32:55.712 --> 32:58.324
Maria's contact at WITSEC.

32:58.367 --> 33:00.065
And they didn't just beat him.

33:00.108 --> 33:01.544
They tortured him.

33:01.588 --> 33:03.938
Did Wright know where
Maria and Torres were hiding?

33:03.982 --> 33:06.810
Call Torres and tell him to get
the hell out of that hotel.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.430
How'd Diaz find us?

33:17.473 --> 33:18.997
Keep moving.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.650
Where are we going?Anywhere but here.

33:21.651 --> 33:22.870
[gunfire]

33:22.913 --> 33:24.263
Go, go, go, go, go!

33:24.306 --> 33:25.742
Go back.

33:26.917 --> 33:28.876
[panting softly]

33:28.919 --> 33:30.834
Go, go, go, go.
Get down.

33:32.445 --> 33:35.491
You hurt?I don't think so.

33:35.535 --> 33:37.841
Listen to me. Listen to me.

33:37.885 --> 33:40.279
You can do this.Do what?

33:42.803 --> 33:44.848
Dude, are you kidding me?

33:44.892 --> 33:46.459
You trust me, right?No.

33:46.502 --> 33:48.200
Okay, that was
a stupid question.

33:48.243 --> 33:49.853
What do you expect me to do?

33:49.897 --> 33:52.769
I want you to shoot anyone
who walks through that door.

33:53.944 --> 33:56.425
When I leave,
you call this number.

33:56.469 --> 33:58.253
You tell them Diaz is here.

33:58.297 --> 33:59.646
Where are you going?

34:00.690 --> 34:02.083
I'm gonna end this.

34:02.127 --> 34:03.780
I'm gonna get Diaz
before he gets you.

34:03.824 --> 34:06.174
You shoot anyone
who walks through that door.

34:08.263 --> 34:10.483
Wait. What if it's you?

34:10.526 --> 34:11.832
Then don't shoot.

34:11.875 --> 34:13.399
Maybe we should have a signal.

34:13.442 --> 34:15.096
Like knock twice or something.

34:15.140 --> 34:17.272
Fine, I'll knock twice.

34:18.273 --> 34:19.535
Hey.

34:21.189 --> 34:23.104
Don't die.

34:30.590 --> 34:32.374
McGEE: Torres, talk to me.It's Maria.

34:32.418 --> 34:34.028
Diaz is here. We-we need help.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.725
All right, hang on.
We're ten minutes out.

34:35.769 --> 34:37.292
We don't have ten minutes.

34:37.336 --> 34:39.990
[distant door opens and closes]

34:40.034 --> 34:41.427
[whispers]:
I got to go.

34:52.829 --> 34:54.266
Diaz!

34:55.267 --> 34:57.095
Heard you were looking for me.

34:57.138 --> 34:59.140
You stole six years of my life.

34:59.184 --> 35:00.750
Why don't you
put your weapon down,

35:00.794 --> 35:02.143
and we can talk about it.

35:02.187 --> 35:03.449
[chuckles]
Okay.

35:03.492 --> 35:04.711
You first!

35:11.500 --> 35:13.502
[gunfire continues]

35:15.330 --> 35:16.853
[lock beeps]

35:16.897 --> 35:18.116
TORRES:
Diaz!

35:18.159 --> 35:20.857
You're not leaving
this hotel alive.

35:20.901 --> 35:21.902
DIAZ:
I don't care!

35:21.945 --> 35:24.122
I came here to take you with me.

35:24.165 --> 35:25.688
You're gonna
have to kill me first.

35:27.299 --> 35:29.127
[gunfire continues]

35:34.436 --> 35:36.786
That was a lot of ammo
from that little gun.

35:36.830 --> 35:38.266
Maybe all your ammo!

35:40.355 --> 35:42.488
I have waited for this moment

35:42.531 --> 35:45.055
for six years!

35:46.318 --> 35:48.929
What you did to me

35:48.972 --> 35:52.193
after I welcomed you
into my home!

35:52.237 --> 35:53.412
My family!

35:55.631 --> 35:58.243
Did you really think
I would let this go?

35:59.940 --> 36:01.028
[chuckles]

36:01.071 --> 36:02.899
TORRES:
Well, you're gonna have to.

36:05.119 --> 36:07.382
Drop your weapon.

36:09.558 --> 36:11.212
Diaz, drop your weapon.

36:11.256 --> 36:13.301
[grunts]

36:40.285 --> 36:41.721
[lock beeps]

36:45.115 --> 36:47.248
[whispers]:
Maria?

36:47.292 --> 36:49.119
[door closes]

37:03.308 --> 37:05.571
He didn't knock twice.

37:05.614 --> 37:07.529
[chuckles softly]

37:13.274 --> 37:14.884
[gun slides]

37:21.108 --> 37:23.110
Come on. Come on.

37:28.855 --> 37:29.986
It's over.

37:31.988 --> 37:33.468
It's over.

37:38.821 --> 37:40.693
PARKER:
Looks like a shooting gallery.

37:40.736 --> 37:41.955
Yeah.

37:44.784 --> 37:46.351
[sighs]

37:46.394 --> 37:48.440
Any guests get caught
in the cross fire?

37:48.483 --> 37:50.703
Luckily, no, thanks to
the lockdown you ordered.

37:50.746 --> 37:53.053
I guess they won't be renting
out the fifth floor for a while.

37:53.096 --> 37:54.794
I just watched
the entire shoot-out

37:54.837 --> 37:56.491
on the hallway security cams.

37:56.535 --> 37:58.058
Nick's lucky he's alive.

37:58.101 --> 37:59.755
And Maria took out Silva?

37:59.799 --> 38:02.105
Shot him
with Torres's spare gun.

38:02.149 --> 38:03.716
Is Maria okay?

38:03.759 --> 38:06.806
Well, uh, Torres is
escorting her home as we speak.

38:06.849 --> 38:10.026
Yeah. I wonder how that's going.

38:13.726 --> 38:15.075
Wow,
you're really wasting no time

38:15.118 --> 38:16.685
in, uh, moving out of here, huh?

38:16.729 --> 38:19.297
You kidding me?
[scoffs softly]

38:19.340 --> 38:21.124
Adios, Anita.

38:21.168 --> 38:22.300
[chuckles]

38:25.041 --> 38:26.304
What?

38:26.347 --> 38:29.307
You standing there
in this house.

38:31.744 --> 38:34.790
For so long, I had this fantasy
of you walking through the door

38:34.834 --> 38:38.185
and us picking up
right where we left off.

38:39.621 --> 38:42.189
I really am so sorry, Maria.

38:42.232 --> 38:44.234
I know.

38:44.278 --> 38:46.585
If you're waiting
for forgiveness,

38:46.628 --> 38:48.717
I'm not there yet.[suitcase zips]

38:48.761 --> 38:51.154
I know.

38:51.198 --> 38:53.200
I understand
why you did what you did.

38:55.115 --> 38:57.160
You were in
an impossible position.

38:58.248 --> 39:01.251
Losing you was
the hardest moment of my life.

39:01.295 --> 39:02.688
Good.

39:02.731 --> 39:04.342
[chuckles softly]

39:05.386 --> 39:08.041
So, where you gonna go
now that you're free?

39:08.084 --> 39:10.870
I'm gonna stay
with my mom for a while.

39:10.913 --> 39:13.916
We have six birthdays
and Christmases to catch up on.

39:17.050 --> 39:19.182
And then?Honestly,

39:19.226 --> 39:21.010
I don't know
where I'm gonna live next.

39:21.054 --> 39:23.404
But wherever it is,
I'm gonna hang

39:23.448 --> 39:25.885
a lot of paintings.Good.

39:25.928 --> 39:27.756
Because when I saw
the bare walls yesterday,

39:27.800 --> 39:29.845
I, uh, couldn't believe
this was your home.

39:29.889 --> 39:31.412
It wasn't.

39:31.456 --> 39:33.283
It was Anita's.

39:33.327 --> 39:36.025
Yeah, and you let her sell
Maria's entire collection.

39:36.069 --> 39:37.462
No.

39:37.505 --> 39:39.812
I kept one.

39:39.855 --> 39:41.857
â™ª

39:46.906 --> 39:48.342
Remember this beauty?

39:48.386 --> 39:50.039
How can I forget?

39:50.083 --> 39:51.563
You kept my painting?

39:51.606 --> 39:53.565
Of course I did.

39:53.608 --> 39:56.524
It's not like I could sell it.

39:56.568 --> 39:59.005
This damn thing is hideous.

39:59.048 --> 40:01.616
Okay. I blame the teacher.

40:06.491 --> 40:09.798
From now on, you need anything,

40:09.842 --> 40:12.279
all you have to do is call.

40:14.020 --> 40:16.675
I promise

40:16.718 --> 40:19.068
I'll be there for you.

40:24.117 --> 40:26.119
This time, I...

40:27.686 --> 40:28.991
I believe you.

40:34.127 --> 40:36.085
Two days, two gunfights.

40:36.129 --> 40:37.870
You're still breathing.
You okay?

40:37.913 --> 40:39.306
Yeah.

40:39.349 --> 40:40.786
I'm used to it.

40:40.829 --> 40:42.918
After all this time,
it must feel great

40:42.962 --> 40:44.833
to make amends with Maria.

40:44.877 --> 40:49.185
It's kind of nice to finally
take someone out of my backpack.

40:49.229 --> 40:51.884
And I think we're gonna
be really good friends.

40:51.927 --> 40:54.190
Just friends?

40:54.234 --> 40:56.279
For now.

40:56.323 --> 40:58.281
Too much water under the bridge.

40:58.325 --> 41:00.458
I understand.

41:02.938 --> 41:04.940
You know, seeing her...

41:06.942 --> 41:09.945
...brought back
this-this feeling.

41:13.166 --> 41:16.125
It just made me
realize something.

41:17.170 --> 41:19.433
You want that feeling again?

41:19.477 --> 41:21.870
You deserve that, Nick.

41:23.872 --> 41:26.527
You do believe
you deserve that, right?

41:27.572 --> 41:28.964
No.

41:31.140 --> 41:33.752
Not yet.

41:33.795 --> 41:36.145
I got to get myself right first.

41:36.189 --> 41:38.626
How you gonna do that?

41:38.670 --> 41:41.020
By doing
what my father never did.

41:41.063 --> 41:42.978
Facing my demons head-on

41:43.022 --> 41:45.415
and becoming the man
that I want to be.

41:45.459 --> 41:47.592
The man he never was.

41:47.635 --> 41:50.246
[chuckles]: Well,
it sounds like the last few days

41:50.290 --> 41:53.336
have added up to about
a decade's worth of therapy.

41:53.380 --> 41:56.209
Well, you helped, too.

41:57.645 --> 42:00.126
With this newfound clarity,

42:00.169 --> 42:01.693
I'd like to ask you

42:01.736 --> 42:04.696
the question that I asked you
a couple of days ago.

42:04.739 --> 42:06.175
Mm.

42:08.656 --> 42:10.919
Do you want to be sober?

42:14.923 --> 42:16.882
Yes.

42:16.925 --> 42:19.406
But if my father
ever taught me anything,

42:19.449 --> 42:21.451
it's that words don't matter.

42:23.453 --> 42:25.847
Your word matters to me.

42:25.891 --> 42:29.198
If you tell me yes,
I believe you.

42:31.418 --> 42:33.681
You know it won't be easy.

42:35.683 --> 42:38.207
Nothing worth it ever is.
