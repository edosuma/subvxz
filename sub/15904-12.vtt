00:18.152 --> 00:20.154
*

00:25.159 --> 00:27.895
"As Malcolm bent
the 17-year-old Sally

00:27.929 --> 00:31.132
over the lip of his tanker desk,
he thought back to her baptism."

00:31.165 --> 00:32.200
What the shit?!

00:32.234 --> 00:33.868
"That summer day in '73,
every car radio

00:33.901 --> 00:35.737
"blaring
'Search and Destroy,'

00:35.770 --> 00:37.572
"a warm rain lashing down

00:37.605 --> 00:40.808
like sweat flinging off
a groupie's bouncing tits."

00:40.842 --> 00:44.212
It's like being molested by
an audio book. What is this?

00:44.246 --> 00:46.147
"The Width of a Peach."
My masterpiece

00:46.180 --> 00:48.483
of multi-generational
sexploitative literature.

00:48.516 --> 00:49.717
Why the hell

00:49.751 --> 00:51.486
would you read me literature?

00:51.519 --> 00:53.421
You know I don't like
good things.

00:53.455 --> 00:56.224
Last night, you said that
I would never be successful.

00:56.258 --> 00:58.192
Well, I stayed up
all night

00:58.226 --> 01:02.397
and wrote 35 amazing pages
just to spite you.

01:02.430 --> 01:05.767
So, ha! Consider yourself
thoroughly spited.

01:05.800 --> 01:06.868
Ha!

01:06.901 --> 01:08.202
Cool.

01:08.236 --> 01:10.705
Okay, I take back
the thing I said.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.407
You will be successful.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.775
Thank you!

01:13.808 --> 01:16.278
(laptop clatters)

01:16.311 --> 01:17.912
Now it's your turn.

01:17.945 --> 01:20.114
I'm proud of me, too.

01:20.147 --> 01:22.284
No, Jimmy! It's your
turn to take back

01:22.317 --> 01:23.885
the mega-harsh thing
you said to me.

01:23.918 --> 01:26.120
And then, voilÃ , everything
goes back to Normal Town,

01:26.153 --> 01:28.590
et cetera, et cetera--
a little makeup boneage.

01:28.623 --> 01:30.592
Maybe some titty massages
for Jimmy.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.895
Wait, what exactly
am I meant to take back?

01:33.928 --> 01:36.030
(imitates Jimmy): "I can't see
myself having kids with her."

01:36.063 --> 01:37.131
Oh, that.

01:37.164 --> 01:39.200
No, I'm 100% sticking by that.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.369
Hey, can we do this
titty massage on the patio?

01:41.403 --> 01:43.471
I just want to keep an eye
on the hummingbird feeder.

01:43.505 --> 01:45.139
Jimmy!
You have dropped

01:45.172 --> 01:47.909
eight iPhones in the last year,

01:47.942 --> 01:50.478
one into a vat of ranch
at Souplantation.

01:50.512 --> 01:51.813
Child-rearing

01:51.846 --> 01:53.247
requires skill.

01:53.281 --> 01:54.982
It's not the same
as binge-watching

01:55.016 --> 01:56.584
a season of Exemplify.

01:56.618 --> 01:58.052
Oh, my God!

01:58.085 --> 02:01.389
That is so sexist
and mansplainy.

02:01.423 --> 02:03.625
You a Gamergater?
Am I living with a Gamergater?

02:03.658 --> 02:06.428
LINDSAY:
Quiet, already!

02:06.461 --> 02:07.762
Why is Lindsay here?

02:07.795 --> 02:09.931
She dumped Paul hard.
I said she could crash.

02:09.964 --> 02:11.666
Mmm...

02:11.699 --> 02:14.402
Oh, my...
(Jimmy sighs)

02:14.436 --> 02:16.938
(sighs):
Ah...

02:18.005 --> 02:19.507
What?

02:19.541 --> 02:21.509
I'm supposed to wear pajamas
like an old?

02:23.144 --> 02:25.112
Mmm...

02:25.146 --> 02:27.982
*

02:30.051 --> 02:32.854
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

02:32.887 --> 02:35.623
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

02:35.657 --> 02:38.960
* Gonna leave you anyway.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.767
Wakey-wakey.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.535
I just wrapped up an
early-morning shift

02:47.569 --> 02:49.771
cleaning a frat house
after a "Colonial Bros

02:49.804 --> 02:51.305
and Nava-hos" party.

02:51.339 --> 02:52.707
Got the puke
cleaned up,

02:52.740 --> 02:54.141
but the racism
and cultural appropriation

02:54.175 --> 02:56.277
are gonna leave a stain.
Hey, I brought pastries.

02:56.310 --> 02:59.881
Okay, but do you want to talk
about last night?

02:59.914 --> 03:01.616
Oh, my God.
I was so drunk.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.851
I think I might have hit up
a Del Taco drive-through.

03:03.885 --> 03:06.821
I'm missing my side mirror, and
my fingers smell like hot sauce.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.856
Wait. You drove yourself home?
Sure.

03:08.890 --> 03:10.324
Drunk driving is easy.

03:10.358 --> 03:11.393
It's just like
playing a video game.

03:11.426 --> 03:14.128
You totally freaked out
on me last night.

03:14.161 --> 03:16.230
Well, you took me to a wedding,
and then you ditched me

03:16.263 --> 03:17.732
to work on sketch ideas.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.200
Who are you, Will Sasso?

03:19.233 --> 03:20.868
This is my first writing job.

03:20.902 --> 03:22.570
I didn't know anybody,
and you abandoned me.

03:22.604 --> 03:25.673
Yeah. Well, okay,
I can see how that...

03:25.707 --> 03:30.311
oh, was really sucky of me.

03:30.344 --> 03:33.014
It was. Thank you.

03:39.954 --> 03:42.390
You know,
I'm happy for you.

03:42.424 --> 03:44.258
I mean, shit,
I'm a liberal.

03:44.291 --> 03:45.760
God knows
I should applaud

03:45.793 --> 03:48.596
when an underrepresented
voice gets heard.

03:48.630 --> 03:50.965
You mean veterans?

03:52.434 --> 03:54.335
Yeah. That, too.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.870
Hey, you want a pastry?

03:55.903 --> 03:58.406
I-I just want to make sure
that you aren't implying

03:58.440 --> 04:01.242
that I was hired
just because I'm Latino.

04:01.275 --> 04:04.278
What? Of course not.
I don't even see race.

04:09.484 --> 04:10.952
Hey, when did they put
this awesome eagle

04:10.985 --> 04:12.720
on the Italian flag?

04:13.721 --> 04:15.723
*

04:20.928 --> 04:22.964
(knock on door)

04:24.899 --> 04:26.901
(knock on door)

04:31.072 --> 04:32.073
Paul?

04:33.274 --> 04:36.444
What you did was
unspeakable!

04:36.478 --> 04:38.613
Unconscionable!

04:38.646 --> 04:41.449
Indefensible!
Indedibble-dobble!

04:41.483 --> 04:43.317
How could you abort that baby
without telling me?

04:43.350 --> 04:45.953
It wasn't a baby, Paul.
It was just a bunch of cells.

04:45.987 --> 04:47.321
You destroyed our family!

04:47.354 --> 04:49.557
Name one family
that's just a bunch of cells.

04:49.591 --> 04:51.092
Osmosis Jones.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.327
Why does everyone
keep doing that?

04:53.360 --> 04:55.396
What made you think
you had the right

04:55.429 --> 04:57.098
to make that decision for us?

04:57.131 --> 04:58.633
My body, my choice.

04:58.666 --> 05:01.135
It's not that cut-and-dried
when you're married.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.436
My body, my choice.

05:02.470 --> 05:03.738
There's a difference between

05:03.771 --> 05:05.272
claiming your
reproductive rights

05:05.306 --> 05:06.641
and behaving like a complete...

05:06.674 --> 05:08.843
My body, my choice.
Stop saying that!

05:08.876 --> 05:10.244
No, Paul. You stop.

05:10.277 --> 05:11.312
Me and my sisters,

05:11.345 --> 05:13.014
we fought for this right
for millenniums.

05:13.047 --> 05:15.282
This is why Margaret Thatcher
went to prison.

05:16.183 --> 05:17.485
Can you please
put on some clothes

05:17.519 --> 05:18.686
while we have
this conversation?

05:18.720 --> 05:20.421
No, Paul. My body, my choice.

05:20.454 --> 05:21.956
And now,

05:21.989 --> 05:26.260
I choose to go outside
and smoke.

05:26.293 --> 05:30.031
Because it's my body.

05:34.035 --> 05:35.136
My choice.

05:35.169 --> 05:36.904
That's right, sucka.

05:40.542 --> 05:41.909
(door closes)

05:47.915 --> 05:50.885
*

05:55.923 --> 05:58.793
Look, I meant it as
a good thing, okay? Yes,

05:58.826 --> 06:00.461
sometimes minorities
get jobs over white people,

06:00.494 --> 06:02.564
even when they're both
equally qualified,

06:02.597 --> 06:04.465
or maybe the minority is
slightly less qualified.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.333
But I think that
that is good for the world,

06:06.367 --> 06:09.203
and I simply got you
these cool and funky pastries

06:09.236 --> 06:10.805
'cause they're cool and funky,

06:10.838 --> 06:13.675
not because they're Latino,
or whatever.

06:13.708 --> 06:15.242
Here, try one.
They're "pan dulthes."

06:15.276 --> 06:17.979
(snickers) Wait.
What are you saying?

06:18.012 --> 06:19.547
"Pan dulthes."

06:19.581 --> 06:21.415
Edgar, they're "pan dulthes."

06:22.550 --> 06:23.918
I pronounce everything
with a Castilian "S,"

06:23.951 --> 06:25.753
because I studied abroad
in "Barthelona."

06:25.787 --> 06:28.690
For you to say that I have
the advantage is insulting.

06:30.191 --> 06:33.394
I mean, if anyone has
the advantage, it's you.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.931
How do I have the advantage?
(chuckles)

06:36.964 --> 06:39.033
You're a white girl.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.368
There's literally a part
for you in every script

06:41.402 --> 06:43.104
that's ever been written.

06:43.137 --> 06:44.939
Not Glengarry Glen Ross
or 700 Sundays.

06:44.972 --> 06:47.208
Besides, don't you read?

06:47.241 --> 06:48.710
People just, like,
they hate women now.

06:48.743 --> 06:50.377
You don't even have
to hide it anymore.

06:50.411 --> 06:51.779
Yeah, well, you never read,

06:51.813 --> 06:54.048
"Cut to funny brown guy
with perfect features."

06:54.916 --> 06:57.084
You have the advantage.
Yeah.

06:57.118 --> 06:58.285
Because it's such
an advantage to be

06:58.319 --> 06:59.621
constantly
sexually harassed.

06:59.654 --> 07:01.522
And it's so advantageous
to only be cast

07:01.555 --> 07:03.858
as "Pretty Girl Number 3"
or "Overworked Mom."

07:03.891 --> 07:05.727
I thought you didn't book
"Overworked Mom."

07:05.760 --> 07:08.429
And it's such an advantage to
be slut-shamed for six years

07:08.462 --> 07:10.765
because I accidentally sucked
Brian Dunkleman's dick

07:10.798 --> 07:12.533
'cause I thought
he was Chris Hardwick.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.268
Look, can we at
least agree that

07:14.301 --> 07:16.103
the true enemy here
is the white male?

07:16.137 --> 07:17.138
JIMMY:
Whoa!

07:17.171 --> 07:19.473
Not me. I'm an immigrant.

07:19.506 --> 07:20.474
Our story

07:20.507 --> 07:22.209
is so tragic.

07:22.243 --> 07:25.479
Do you know how many of us
drown every day

07:25.512 --> 07:26.881
trying to get over here?

07:26.914 --> 07:30.251
And the true villain is
the white American male.

07:30.284 --> 07:33.821
Bad things happen
to white American men, too.

07:33.855 --> 07:35.957
Real bad things.

07:35.990 --> 07:39.426
You know, why don't I
let you white people

07:39.460 --> 07:42.329
tell me how bad you all have it.

07:42.997 --> 07:44.198
Jesus!

07:49.270 --> 07:51.172
Oh, look, wife.

07:51.205 --> 07:53.908
I'm about to rip
my lung tissue asunder

07:53.941 --> 07:55.442
with the devil's tobacco

07:55.476 --> 07:59.681
because my life has been
destroyed by the woman I love!

07:59.714 --> 08:01.983
Your body, your choice.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.652
You know, I almost left you.

08:04.686 --> 08:06.520
When Vernon and I were

08:06.553 --> 08:07.655
lost in the woods,

08:07.689 --> 08:09.691
he wanted to bail
and go live in Mexico.

08:09.724 --> 08:11.158
I should have gone

08:11.192 --> 08:12.860
and started my life anew,

08:12.894 --> 08:16.097
like John McAfee,
software millionaire!

08:16.130 --> 08:17.832
Shoulda-woulda-coulda!
JIMMY: Right.

08:17.865 --> 08:20.634
Can you two idiots
do this at your place?

08:20.668 --> 08:23.337
No! If you send them home,
her wishy-washy ass

08:23.370 --> 08:26.173
will be lured back into that
suck-butt marriage by lunch.

08:26.207 --> 08:27.541
Shut up, Gretchen!

08:27.574 --> 08:29.777
You shut up!
Aw, shit!

08:29.811 --> 08:32.546
Fine. Then just go
and fight in my room.
Our room.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.548
But don't touch anything,
don't sit,

08:34.581 --> 08:36.183
and hands off
the bed booze.

08:36.217 --> 08:38.519
(sighs)

08:41.022 --> 08:43.890
*

08:53.600 --> 08:55.002
What?!

08:55.036 --> 08:57.504
Nothing. I just...

08:57.538 --> 09:00.207
Sometimes I look at you
and I think,

09:00.241 --> 09:03.177
"How did this person
get in my house?"

09:03.210 --> 09:04.979
It's like I've lost
the thread of a novel,

09:05.012 --> 09:06.647
and all of a sudden,
there's this

09:06.680 --> 09:08.482
messy short woman

09:08.515 --> 09:10.985
who's clearly important
to the story.

09:11.018 --> 09:13.187
So, I'm flipping back, thinking,

09:13.220 --> 09:16.190
"I don't remember that character
being introduced."

09:16.223 --> 09:18.826
Tell me about it! Some days
it's like I un-blacked out

09:18.860 --> 09:22.029
from a week-long bender, and
now I'm in this weird-ass house

09:22.063 --> 09:23.731
with sharp corners.

09:23.765 --> 09:26.934
My mate was supposed to be
so different.

09:26.968 --> 09:29.670
Classy, unbruised,

09:29.703 --> 09:31.205
a first-chair violinist

09:31.238 --> 09:33.107
for the Philharmonic. (chuckles)

09:33.140 --> 09:34.909
God, can you imagine it?

09:34.942 --> 09:36.610
Me in the wings

09:36.643 --> 09:38.045
of Disney Hall.

09:38.079 --> 09:40.614
And we wave good-bye
to the other musicians,

09:40.647 --> 09:42.216
and I joke about

09:42.249 --> 09:43.550
what a drag it must be

09:43.584 --> 09:46.954
for Igor to haul
that double bass home.

09:46.988 --> 09:49.056
And then Dudamel does
a champagne spit-take

09:49.090 --> 09:51.092
and shakes his head at me like,

09:51.125 --> 09:54.061
(Venezuelan accent):
"Oh, Jimmy, you are too much."

09:54.095 --> 09:55.897
(laughs)
How am I not

09:55.930 --> 09:59.801
arm candy for some international
movie star with a giant dong?

09:59.834 --> 10:01.302
Yeah.
He's part owner of

10:01.335 --> 10:02.904
a cool tech company

10:02.937 --> 10:05.639
and invents apps when he's not
dick-punching Peter Sarsgaard

10:05.672 --> 10:07.408
in his latest movie.
Sometimes,

10:07.441 --> 10:10.978
we talk about adopting a kid
from a third-world country,

10:11.012 --> 10:12.513
but we never do it.

10:13.414 --> 10:15.316
And we live in
a legit-ass castle

10:15.349 --> 10:18.219
in Malibu with one of those
big modern art pieces

10:18.252 --> 10:20.922
by the guy who does
the big dots.

10:20.955 --> 10:22.089
What? Lichtenstein?

10:22.123 --> 10:24.591
Yeah. A big old Lichtenstein.
Wow.

10:24.625 --> 10:28.095
How very sophomore year
art history of you. (chuckles)

10:28.129 --> 10:31.065
You definitely shouldn't
decorate your own house.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.166
(laughs, gasps)

10:41.775 --> 10:44.478
(knocking)
Knock, knock.

10:44.511 --> 10:47.481
White lady visiting from
the Aryan zone. You still mad?

10:47.514 --> 10:50.117
Maybe you only like me
when I'm struggling.

10:52.987 --> 10:55.256
You think that I want you
to struggle?
Think about it.

10:55.289 --> 10:58.192
When we first met,
I was your insecure student.

10:58.225 --> 11:01.028
Then I was your vet boyfriend
with PTSD.

11:01.062 --> 11:03.464
Then I was a stoner
with no future.

11:03.497 --> 11:06.633
But the second I get
a tiny bit of success,

11:06.667 --> 11:08.202
you freak out.

11:08.235 --> 11:12.306
You forced me to engage
in acts of sexual deviance.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.941
But you started this!

11:13.975 --> 11:17.144
You threw your bike
onto the street,

11:17.178 --> 11:19.713
and said we were new people,
and I put on

11:19.746 --> 11:21.983
that whole Napron-wearing,
good wifey act,

11:22.016 --> 11:24.185
even though I was dying
on the inside.

11:24.218 --> 11:26.954
You went along with
it for 20 minutes.

11:26.988 --> 11:28.355
And then you stabbed me!

11:28.389 --> 11:30.491
You want me to hide my bees
under a bushel.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.793
You use your niceness
to stifle me,

11:32.826 --> 11:34.795
and then you make me
feel guilty.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.130
You stabbed me!

11:36.163 --> 11:37.731
We both did things we regret.

11:37.764 --> 11:39.733
Relationships are messy.

11:39.766 --> 11:42.503
You're actually tearing apart
my hypothetical fantasy.

11:42.536 --> 11:43.905
Now you want to tell me

11:43.938 --> 11:46.040
what I can and can't imagine?

11:46.073 --> 11:48.075
You admitted that
you don't like good things.

11:48.109 --> 11:49.710
I'm just confirming that.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.712
You should seriously shut up

11:51.745 --> 11:54.181
sometimes, Jimmy.
Just shut all the way up.

11:54.215 --> 11:57.885
I mean, what if I did
make something of myself? Hmm?

11:57.919 --> 11:59.186
If I did

11:59.220 --> 12:02.756
rise up there
to your level, why?

12:02.789 --> 12:04.658
Why would that be so bad?!

12:04.691 --> 12:08.329
Because I am not up there!

12:08.362 --> 12:09.396
Okay?

12:09.430 --> 12:10.764
I am down!

12:10.797 --> 12:13.700
I am the downest
that I have ever been.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.236
You want messy?!

12:15.269 --> 12:17.704
I'll show you messy!

12:19.473 --> 12:20.707
(yells)

12:20.741 --> 12:22.276
Oh, no, Paul!

12:22.309 --> 12:23.744
Now you're going
to have bad luck.

12:23.777 --> 12:26.380
I have bad luck!

12:26.413 --> 12:28.349
You're my bad luck!

12:28.382 --> 12:30.851
God! You're so selfish.

12:30.884 --> 12:34.288
There is something
seriously wrong with you.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.790
Why did I marry you?

12:36.823 --> 12:37.959
Why?!

12:37.992 --> 12:39.693
(grunts)

12:39.726 --> 12:41.562
Look, if your fantasy
is so fragile...
Picking, pick, pick.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.397
...that I'm able
to dismantle it...
Pick at everything I say and do.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.432
...then maybe it wasn't
so great to begin with.
I'm sick of living

12:45.466 --> 12:47.101
underneath your highfalutin
surveillance state.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.569
Plus, "hypothetical fantasy"
is redundant.

12:48.602 --> 12:49.803
I just silenced
the judgy mom voice in my head.

12:49.836 --> 12:51.705
I don't need another one
from you.

12:51.738 --> 12:53.574
LINDSAY:
Stop using your big voice at me!

12:53.607 --> 12:55.542
DOROTHY: Don't hug me.
Just let me be sad!

12:55.576 --> 12:59.446
PAUL: I'll use my big voice
at you whenever I want!

12:59.480 --> 13:02.616
I'm only using my big voice
with you now!

13:02.649 --> 13:04.351
(Paul continues shouting)

13:07.254 --> 13:08.589
(scoffs)

13:11.825 --> 13:13.127
(sniffles)

13:13.160 --> 13:15.496
(chuckles)

13:15.529 --> 13:17.531
You... Come on.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.435
You had a rough month.

13:23.004 --> 13:24.405
You'll bounce back.

13:24.438 --> 13:26.473
I'm a 30-something
failed actress

13:26.507 --> 13:30.777
living in a disgusting
K-Town studio.

13:30.811 --> 13:33.347
I haven't been
to the dentist in years.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.682
My agent told me
to gain 20 pounds

13:35.716 --> 13:38.352
so that I could at least
audition to be the kooky aunt.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.820
(sobs)

13:41.522 --> 13:43.524
(yells) Oh, God!

13:43.557 --> 13:45.559
(grunting)

13:48.895 --> 13:51.498
Oh, God. You ruined my life!

13:51.532 --> 13:54.435
Why?! Why did you do it?!

13:54.468 --> 13:56.470
Paul.
(groaning)

13:56.503 --> 13:58.339
Look at me.

13:58.372 --> 14:01.275
(panting)
Paul.

14:01.308 --> 14:04.978
You knew it was a snake
when you picked it up.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.948
What?

14:07.981 --> 14:10.151
You knew who I was.

14:11.552 --> 14:14.388
You don't get
to act surprised now.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.423
*

14:22.163 --> 14:23.164
(phone beeps)

14:31.538 --> 14:34.508
Becca and Vernon had their baby.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.943
It's a girl.

14:39.246 --> 14:40.881
Tallulah.

14:41.915 --> 14:44.017
Ew.
(phone vibrates)

14:44.051 --> 14:46.987
(chuckles, sniffles)

14:47.020 --> 14:48.955
Becca had her baby.

14:54.361 --> 14:55.562
(phones chime)

14:59.533 --> 15:00.867
(sighs)

15:00.901 --> 15:04.071
Dorothy's crying.
It's very mucous-y.

15:04.105 --> 15:07.040
Lindsay's just reciting the
spoken word parts of "Lemonade."

15:07.074 --> 15:08.409
(scoffs)

15:08.442 --> 15:10.244
Such idiots.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.746
We're no better
than them.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.615
Oh, speak for yourself.

15:14.648 --> 15:16.617
I'm not the one
who flung my sandwich

15:16.650 --> 15:19.086
like a upset chimp at the zoo.

15:19.120 --> 15:21.088
I threw it because
I realized I was living

15:21.122 --> 15:22.623
with an uptight dildo

15:22.656 --> 15:24.358
whose personality
unmakes itself

15:24.391 --> 15:26.227
anytime something bad happens.

15:26.260 --> 15:30.297
Says the woman who spent weeks
catatonic on the couch

15:30.331 --> 15:32.133
in crusty yoga pants.

15:32.166 --> 15:34.901
I have a clinical
goddamn illness!
Oh, right.

15:34.935 --> 15:38.739
So you just win because your
condition is listed in the DSM?

15:38.772 --> 15:41.275
No! I win because I am
doing something about it.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.043
You're just lashing out

15:43.076 --> 15:44.445
and putting me
under a microscope!

15:44.478 --> 15:46.280
It just happened!

15:47.414 --> 15:49.116
He just died.

15:49.150 --> 15:51.084
Right, I am still grieving,
Gretchen.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.253
Jesus Christ!

15:52.286 --> 15:54.155
But I was there first!
Where?!

15:54.188 --> 15:56.157
Here! In shit, miserable!

15:56.190 --> 15:58.559
There just isn't room

15:58.592 --> 16:01.628
for you to be broken
right now, too.

16:01.662 --> 16:04.165
Oh, that...

16:04.198 --> 16:05.932
that is complete...

16:05.966 --> 16:07.100
(exhales)

16:10.036 --> 16:11.472
How is that okay?

16:11.505 --> 16:12.673
It's not.

16:12.706 --> 16:15.142
It is completely unfair.

16:15.176 --> 16:17.644
No. This is not supposed to...

16:17.678 --> 16:20.581
One person is supposed to be
in the hospital bed.

16:20.614 --> 16:23.317
And then the other uncomfortably
sleeping on that little couch,

16:23.350 --> 16:25.252
just sneaking home
to shower and...

16:25.286 --> 16:26.820
(voice breaks):
and walk the dog.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.355
Right?
(exhales)

16:28.389 --> 16:31.958
Right, Jimmy.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.059
And yet...

16:46.340 --> 16:49.710
JIMMY:
I said don't touch anything!

16:49.743 --> 16:51.712
I knew it was a snake.

16:51.745 --> 16:53.046
Get out!

16:53.079 --> 16:55.081
(sighs)

17:01.522 --> 17:03.690
You told me
we could leave any time.

17:03.724 --> 17:05.692
Right.
So why didn't you?

17:05.726 --> 17:07.627
I've been mean.
I have been angry.

17:07.661 --> 17:09.530
I've been judging you.

17:09.563 --> 17:12.031
Which was our one promise,
from the beginning.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.733
If you were serious
about leaving,

17:13.767 --> 17:15.236
then you would have gone by now.

17:15.269 --> 17:17.037
You didn't
leave, either.
I know.

17:17.069 --> 17:18.038
I don't know why.

17:18.070 --> 17:21.074
I think this may be impossible.

17:30.050 --> 17:33.554
But can't that be okay?

17:33.587 --> 17:39.192
I mean, the-the vast majority
of all human effort,

17:39.226 --> 17:42.563
however great or miniscule,
ends in failure.

17:42.596 --> 17:44.565
So, what are your options?

17:45.932 --> 17:48.369
You just ad-admit pre-defeat

17:48.402 --> 17:51.272
because the odds are
that you're gonna be right?

17:51.305 --> 17:53.474
Or you do it anyway?

17:57.544 --> 17:59.546
(sighs)

18:00.714 --> 18:02.115
Maybe we're a success...

18:02.148 --> 18:03.584
(chuckles softly)

18:03.617 --> 18:05.185
...regardless of the outcome,

18:05.218 --> 18:08.322
because... we tried.

18:10.324 --> 18:12.225
Maybe there's beauty
in the struggle

18:12.259 --> 18:14.395
against near certain failure.

18:14.428 --> 18:15.596
Is that enough?

18:15.629 --> 18:17.398
A beautiful struggle?

18:17.431 --> 18:19.400
Maybe.
It's all gonna
suck one day,

18:19.433 --> 18:21.435
so enjoy it now,
stop rocking the boat,

18:21.468 --> 18:23.470
and that is goddamn it?!

18:31.011 --> 18:32.613
It's like in my book.

18:32.646 --> 18:34.315
Ugh, no more book.

18:34.348 --> 18:35.482
Gretchen tired.

18:35.516 --> 18:36.817
In chapter 12,

18:36.850 --> 18:38.652
Kitty is headed to Lisbon

18:38.685 --> 18:40.120
to follow Take That on tour,

18:40.153 --> 18:42.889
but instead
she stays with Simon,

18:42.923 --> 18:46.427
though they have
no possible future.

18:46.460 --> 18:48.429
Oh, my God!
That's makes perfect sense.

18:48.462 --> 18:50.764
That's why they
stay together.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.766
They are mirrors of you and I.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.668
Theirs is
a love forbidden,

18:54.701 --> 18:57.404
thus... doomed.

18:57.438 --> 18:58.472
Why is it forbidden?

18:58.505 --> 18:59.940
Well, because
they're half-siblings.

18:59.973 --> 19:00.941
Wait, what?!

19:00.974 --> 19:02.142
Jimmy, we talking incest?

19:02.175 --> 19:03.810
How did you miss that?

19:03.844 --> 19:05.011
I wasn't listening that good.

19:05.045 --> 19:06.447
Look, when I came up
with this story,

19:06.480 --> 19:08.315
I was, I was falling in love
with you...

19:08.349 --> 19:09.783
e-even though it was,

19:09.816 --> 19:11.785
it was scary and-and wrong.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.655
I thought that
I was avoiding my feelings

19:14.688 --> 19:16.690
by writing my book,
but it was you

19:16.723 --> 19:18.525
who was fueling me

19:18.559 --> 19:19.793
this whole time.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.863
Fueling you to write
about a couple of horny sibs?

19:22.896 --> 19:24.197
Give me.

19:27.233 --> 19:29.135
Show me the part
you cranked out last night

19:29.169 --> 19:30.303
when you were all upset.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.805
Oh, no way.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.975
If you're experiencing
the sweeping psychodrama

19:35.008 --> 19:36.877
of The Width of a Peach,

19:36.910 --> 19:38.144
you're starting
at the beginning.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.713
(chuckles)

19:39.746 --> 19:41.047
Chapter one.

19:41.081 --> 19:43.049
"A deep, orgasmic moaning

19:43.083 --> 19:45.652
"came from behind
the undersized attic door,

"while far above,

"was falling towards

City of London,

19:56.229 --> 19:57.564
Why do we need
the post...

19:57.598 --> 19:59.966
Good writing is detailed.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.735
Shh.

20:03.269 --> 20:07.007
Oh, I've been so
jealous and awful.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.675
I've been trying to get a job
for so long,

20:08.709 --> 20:10.343
and then when it happened
for you so quickly,

20:10.377 --> 20:12.312
I just... couldn't handle it.

20:12.345 --> 20:13.714
Hey...

20:13.747 --> 20:17.050
I was so intimidated by you
in our first class.

20:17.083 --> 20:20.454
You did the whole intro
in that fake Norwegian accent.

20:21.522 --> 20:23.223
My insecure vampire character.

20:23.256 --> 20:24.190
Mm-hmm.

20:24.224 --> 20:25.358
"Velcome to class.

20:25.392 --> 20:26.827
"I vant to suck your blood...

20:26.860 --> 20:28.429
(laughing)
"because I suck.

20:28.462 --> 20:31.698
Does this cape
make my fangs look fat?"

20:34.701 --> 20:36.202
God, I was funny, huh?

20:36.236 --> 20:38.071
You still are.

20:39.573 --> 20:41.942
(phone ringing)

20:41.975 --> 20:43.410
I'll be right back.

20:45.546 --> 20:47.948

20:47.981 --> 20:49.750
Listen,
I love your sketch ideas.

20:49.783 --> 20:51.184
Still chuckling over
"Lying Lawyer

20:51.217 --> 20:52.853
is a Liar."
I'm putting together

20:52.886 --> 20:54.855
a writers' room for three months
and I need

20:54.888 --> 20:56.222
you in it, starting Monday.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.425
Uh, y-yes.

20:58.459 --> 21:00.126
Y-Yes, Mr. Benson, of course.

21:00.160 --> 21:01.227
Okay, I got to go.

21:01.261 --> 21:02.563
I'm eating sushi

21:02.596 --> 21:03.930
off this Israeli model's
naked bod

21:03.964 --> 21:05.566
and the toro is getting warm.

21:05.599 --> 21:07.133
(woman giggles)

21:07.167 --> 21:08.168
Oh.

21:10.103 --> 21:11.572
DOUG:
Say hi, Tova.

21:13.239 --> 21:15.041
Hmm.
Who was that?

21:15.075 --> 21:17.277
Uh...

21:17.310 --> 21:18.445
my job.

21:18.479 --> 21:19.880
I-I have to go in Monday,

21:19.913 --> 21:21.247
uh, to the gym.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.316
Uh, someone
knocked a door

21:23.349 --> 21:25.385
off of the shower stall...

21:25.418 --> 21:27.554
in the men's locker room.
Colby and Travis?

21:27.588 --> 21:29.956
We'll never know.

21:29.990 --> 21:31.592
But, yeah, obviously.
(laughs)

21:37.197 --> 21:38.632
(whispers):
Yes.

21:47.941 --> 21:50.076
You thought you could master me.

21:50.110 --> 21:52.846
But I'm a person, Paul.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.615
I'm not one of your hobbies.

21:54.648 --> 21:55.916
You're right.

21:55.949 --> 21:59.319
I wanted a family so badly,
I was willing to look past

21:59.352 --> 22:02.689
the septendecillion pieces
of evidence that screamed,

22:02.723 --> 22:04.858
"We are wrong
for each other."

22:04.891 --> 22:07.828
Think you can stay here
a little bit longer?

22:07.861 --> 22:09.863
Just until we get
our affairs in order?

22:09.896 --> 22:11.732
Of course.

22:16.336 --> 22:18.539
I guess... in the end,

22:18.572 --> 22:21.542
we were just two stars
born light-years apart.

22:21.575 --> 22:22.943
You need to find someone

22:22.976 --> 22:24.711
in your own constellation,
Lindsay.

22:24.745 --> 22:27.347
Oh, Bear.

22:27.380 --> 22:29.382
Mm.

22:32.418 --> 22:35.388
So you'll throw away
the prenup?

22:35.421 --> 22:38.024
(exhales)

22:38.058 --> 22:40.026
You stabbed me.

22:40.060 --> 22:43.396
You cuckolded me.

22:43.429 --> 22:46.232
You ruined my life.

22:50.403 --> 22:52.172
Better lawyer up, bitch.

22:52.205 --> 22:54.040
(gasps)

23:09.856 --> 23:12.358
JIMMY: "Simon watched
the man exit the motel,

23:12.392 --> 23:14.527
"and they were alone again.

23:14.561 --> 23:16.362
"He, gazing at her,

23:16.396 --> 23:18.832
"she, staring at
her own reflection.

23:18.865 --> 23:21.768
"Both of them were watching
the same thing,

23:21.802 --> 23:24.571
the tears filling Kitty's eyes."

23:24.605 --> 23:26.573
(sighs softly)

23:27.908 --> 23:30.043
Dude, keep going!

23:30.076 --> 23:32.913
I need to know what happens
with Kitty and Simon and Bug.

23:32.946 --> 23:34.615
I'm so worried about Bug.

23:34.648 --> 23:35.749
Well, that's all I wrote.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.584
Well, go finish it.

23:37.618 --> 23:38.952
You know how it ends, right?

23:38.985 --> 23:41.087
I do now.

23:42.122 --> 23:44.725
But first...

23:44.758 --> 23:46.860
I need to rest my eyes.

23:46.893 --> 23:49.562
I've been up for two days.

23:50.597 --> 23:52.599
Come here.

23:59.472 --> 24:01.808
*

24:01.842 --> 24:04.177
We didn't solve anything.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.448
I know.

24:09.783 --> 24:11.785
Okay.

24:13.353 --> 24:16.589
* This year,
I'll spend November *

24:16.623 --> 24:19.559
* In the house

24:19.592 --> 24:22.062
* August sort of stifled...

24:22.095 --> 24:24.097
Shit.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.498
That's nine.

24:26.532 --> 24:28.268
* It's coyness, boy

24:28.301 --> 24:31.604
* That caught you out

24:31.638 --> 24:37.143
* I know you wish for fireworks
to light your July sky *

24:37.177 --> 24:40.480
* I was the dampest
box of matches *

24:40.513 --> 24:43.249
* You could ever hope to find

24:43.283 --> 24:45.986
* I'm sorry, what?
I hear you, yeah *

24:46.019 --> 24:47.921
* I was watching
the skin peeling *

24:47.954 --> 24:50.523
* Off your sunburnt shoulders,
I know *

24:50.556 --> 24:52.993
* I know you only melt
in the middle *

24:53.026 --> 24:54.527
* Like ice cream and sunscreen

24:54.560 --> 24:57.664
* Blisters in the pit
of my heart. *

24:57.698 --> 25:00.667
(dog barks)

25:03.670 --> 25:06.673
