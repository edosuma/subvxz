<i>Can I be honest with you,
Matt?</i>

02:43.343 --> 02:45.810
Sure thing, Lisa, go ahead.

02:45.812 --> 02:48.413
You know, I was expecting you
to ask me on a date

02:48.415 --> 02:50.414
ever since med school started.

02:50.416 --> 02:52.283
You took your time
until tonight.

02:52.285 --> 02:54.152
Actually I was only waiting
for a special occasion...

02:54.154 --> 02:55.954
But if you're trying
to impress me

02:55.956 --> 02:57.955
with this expensive car,
then...

02:57.957 --> 03:00.727
I think you might
just have the wrong girl.

03:02.195 --> 03:03.828
Oh, Lisa, I'm not,
seriously.

03:03.830 --> 03:05.800
This was the only car
left at home.

03:07.267 --> 03:09.366
I'm sorry... I think
it would just be better

03:09.368 --> 03:11.271
if you take me back home.

03:12.071 --> 03:13.705
Oh... Come on.

03:13.707 --> 03:15.407
Lisa,
I had no choice about the car.

03:15.409 --> 03:17.175
My mom is gonna kill me
when she finds out

03:17.177 --> 03:19.144
I took it for this
three-day vacation.

03:21.682 --> 03:22.717
Lisa?

03:25.318 --> 03:26.949
Damn it.

03:26.951 --> 03:29.890
I'm just messing with you.

03:33.225 --> 03:35.092
I'm sorry, Matt, it's just...

03:35.094 --> 03:37.729
this car probably costs more
than the house I grew up in.

03:37.731 --> 03:39.364
I seriously doubt that.

03:39.366 --> 03:41.299
Oh, look, my dad's
calling from Toronto.

03:41.301 --> 03:43.168
Maybe you want to ask him.

03:43.170 --> 03:45.103
Hey, Dad, just a few hours
since I left.

03:45.105 --> 03:46.837
Do you already miss me?

03:46.839 --> 03:48.740
<i>Oh honey,
you know I always do.</i>

03:48.742 --> 03:51.175
<i>But right now I need to
know if by any chance</i>

03:51.177 --> 03:53.478
- <i>you left some cash here.</i>
- Some cash?

03:53.480 --> 03:56.480
I'm afraid I ordered
some drugs for my asthma.

03:56.482 --> 03:58.483
But now I can't pay
the delivery boy

03:58.485 --> 04:00.185
because I didn't make it
to the ATM today.

04:00.187 --> 04:02.886
Unfortunately,
the neighbors are out too.

04:02.888 --> 04:04.988
But anyway,
I only need like, 10 bucks.

04:04.990 --> 04:07.292
Look, Mr. Murphy,
I gotta be on my way.

04:07.294 --> 04:09.158
<i>Just order again
when you can afford it.</i>

04:09.160 --> 04:11.396
Dad?
Dad, let me talk to this guy.

04:11.398 --> 04:13.930
<i>Maybe there are a few dollars
in my bedroom drawer.</i>

04:13.932 --> 04:16.099
All right, here.
My daughter for you.

04:16.101 --> 04:18.302
Uh...

04:18.303 --> 04:20.437
Great, Lisa Murphy.

04:20.439 --> 04:22.172
David?

04:22.174 --> 04:23.941
David Spencer, is that you?

04:23.943 --> 04:27.111
Wow, we haven't talked since
you broke up with Katie.

04:27.113 --> 04:28.747
Shame.

04:28.749 --> 04:31.080
Listen David,
can I pay this online?

04:31.082 --> 04:32.750
I've got this banking
app thing on my phone.

04:32.752 --> 04:34.319
It should only take
a few minutes.

04:34.321 --> 04:36.487
Uh... nope.

04:36.489 --> 04:38.121
Can't do that Murphy.

04:38.123 --> 04:40.056
You know what?

04:40.058 --> 04:44.027
You sound almost as desperate
as Katie always did.

04:44.029 --> 04:46.463
Funny, David.
Desperate is just

04:46.465 --> 04:48.833
what I thought
when I saw that video of you.

04:48.835 --> 04:50.502
You know, the one where
you're drunk and naked

04:50.504 --> 04:52.807
and tried to do it with
Katie's German Shepherd?

04:55.140 --> 04:57.006
I mean,
thank God the poor animal

04:57.008 --> 04:59.109
managed to get away in time.

04:59.111 --> 05:01.145
You, uh...

05:01.147 --> 05:03.781
you still got that video?

05:03.783 --> 05:05.248
Now I remember.

05:05.250 --> 05:07.150
You weren't totally naked.

05:07.152 --> 05:10.822
You were wearing those
yellow neon tennis socks.

05:10.824 --> 05:12.490
<i>Should get a few clicks
on YouTube.</i>

05:12.492 --> 05:14.391
What?
Uh...

05:14.393 --> 05:15.860
Uh, Lisa, don't do that.

05:15.862 --> 05:17.294
Uh, Mr. Murphy,

05:17.296 --> 05:19.229
just forget
about the money, okay?

05:19.231 --> 05:21.301
Merry Christmas to you, sir.

05:22.836 --> 05:25.068
Lisa, what did you tell him?

05:25.070 --> 05:26.870
Everything's fine Dad.

05:26.872 --> 05:28.473
Just remember to refill
your medication, okay?

05:28.475 --> 05:30.908
Promise.
Talk to you on New Years Eve.

05:30.910 --> 05:32.376
Take care of yourself, honey.

05:32.378 --> 05:33.910
You too, Dad.

05:33.912 --> 05:35.412
Remind me never to
tick you off.

05:42.921 --> 05:45.958
Hey... did we just enter
an airport?

05:47.828 --> 05:49.295
Maybe.

05:50.296 --> 05:52.996
But I thought we were
meeting Roxy and Odin

05:52.998 --> 05:54.802
at your country house.

06:03.274 --> 06:05.275
Don't worry, Lisa.

06:05.277 --> 06:09.414
It's weird... somebody's
supposed to be here by now.

06:13.351 --> 06:15.354
Matt, what's going on?

06:18.123 --> 06:20.457
Look, truth is,

06:20.459 --> 06:21.893
my parents
don't own a country house

06:21.895 --> 06:23.595
in the state of New York.

06:23.597 --> 06:27.397
However, we do own a beach
house in Los Angeles,

06:27.399 --> 06:29.933
Malibu to be precise.

06:29.935 --> 06:32.807
Malibu?

06:36.575 --> 06:38.275
What's wrong?

06:39.611 --> 06:41.446
Get out of the car!

06:53.224 --> 06:56.260
Odin, are you
out of your fucking mind?

06:56.262 --> 06:59.029
Easy, Parker.
You deserve it.

06:59.031 --> 07:00.530
Kept us waiting for like
30 minutes.

07:00.532 --> 07:02.532
Lisa,
did we really scare you?

07:02.534 --> 07:05.301
Please, you have to forgive us.

07:05.303 --> 07:06.570
It's good to see you too,
Roxy.

07:06.572 --> 07:08.304
Now please don't tell me that...

07:08.306 --> 07:11.376
We're flying to California,
baby, whoo!

07:15.246 --> 07:17.246
Guys, I can't just...

07:17.248 --> 07:19.482
Well, you did pack for
three days, didn't you?

07:19.484 --> 07:21.618
So what's the difference?

07:21.620 --> 07:24.987
Of course it'll be a little
warmer on the West Coast.

07:24.989 --> 07:27.390
And a friend of mine
is gonna take us all

07:27.392 --> 07:31.296
to Vin Diesel's movie
premiere tomorrow night.

07:32.630 --> 07:36.400
And this is how we'll be
getting there.

07:36.402 --> 07:39.669
Our Freedom XJ One, with
over 6,000 miles of range

07:39.671 --> 07:42.239
and speeds of up to
700 miles per hour.

07:42.241 --> 07:44.174
It's my dad's private plane.

07:44.176 --> 07:46.676
He made me get my pilot's
license after my 18th birthday

07:46.678 --> 07:51.280
so I could use it for...
special occasions.

07:58.257 --> 08:00.123
Well...

08:00.125 --> 08:01.157
what are we waiting for?

08:01.159 --> 08:02.458
Whoo!

08:02.460 --> 08:04.361
My thoughts exactly.

08:04.363 --> 08:06.899
Come help me with my stuff,
would you?

08:08.133 --> 08:11.034
You have to tell me
everything.

08:11.036 --> 08:12.703
Did you two already kiss?

08:12.705 --> 08:15.237
He hasn't tried,
unfortunately.

08:18.010 --> 08:19.275
There he is, finally.

08:20.746 --> 08:23.013
<i>Ay, dios mio!</i>

08:23.015 --> 08:24.681
I hope speeding
doesn't run in the family.

08:24.683 --> 08:26.152
You should see us fly.

08:28.721 --> 08:31.020
Is this your brother Kyle?

08:31.022 --> 08:33.390
But he's not coming with us,
is he?

08:33.392 --> 08:34.990
No, he's just here
for the handoff.

08:34.991 --> 08:36.392
He piloted the plane
from Paris today

08:36.394 --> 08:38.996
where our parents spend
Christmas.

08:44.035 --> 08:46.435
Hey, little brother,
where have you been?

08:46.437 --> 08:47.770
People have been waiting.

08:47.772 --> 08:49.740
Sorry,
I arrived a little early,

08:49.742 --> 08:52.378
so I took the bike for a spin.

09:04.088 --> 09:06.054
Hi, Lisa.

09:06.056 --> 09:07.426
Hello, Kyle.

09:10.295 --> 09:11.528
Kyle, what's up?

09:11.530 --> 09:12.998
Rosario.

09:13.699 --> 09:16.301
Come on, Lisa,
heaven awaits us.

09:24.209 --> 09:26.378
This way, ladies.

09:26.677 --> 09:29.077
O-M-G!

09:29.079 --> 09:31.147
This is awesome.

09:31.149 --> 09:32.716
Heaven really was
the right word.

09:32.718 --> 09:35.552
Look at this.
This baby's got everything...

09:35.554 --> 09:38.621
TV, stereo, a bar!

09:39.724 --> 09:41.824
And it's well-stocked, too.

09:47.331 --> 09:48.698
I'll have a vodka
on the rocks.

09:48.700 --> 09:50.299
Coming right up, my lady.

09:50.301 --> 09:52.337
Let me just get
my canvases out.

09:57.175 --> 09:59.443
Ground control,
this is FJ2244.

09:59.445 --> 10:01.812
Request permission
for takeoff.

10:01.814 --> 10:04.548
<i>Ground control to FJ2244,</i>

10:04.550 --> 10:07.183
<i>thanks for submitting your
flight plan, Mr. Parker.</i>

10:07.185 --> 10:10.786
<i>However, the name of your
co-pilot seems to be missing.</i>

10:10.788 --> 10:12.756
I'm sorry...
please repeat.

10:12.758 --> 10:14.658
Name of my co-pilot?

10:14.660 --> 10:16.693
<i>As you know,
since December 1st,</i>

10:16.695 --> 10:19.462
<i>a co-pilot is required for
all aircrafts of your type</i>

10:19.464 --> 10:21.798
<i>departing
the State of New York.</i>

10:21.800 --> 10:23.666
New regulations
since December 1st

10:23.668 --> 10:25.167
requiring a co-pilot.

10:25.169 --> 10:26.469
What's he talking about?

10:26.471 --> 10:28.236
I have no idea.

10:28.238 --> 10:31.207
- I landed alone.
- <i>Mr. Parker,</i>

10:31.209 --> 10:33.341
<i>please let me
speak to your co-pilot.</i>

10:33.343 --> 10:35.213
<i>Hello?
Mr. Parker?</i>

10:36.113 --> 10:38.482
Hold on, ground control.

10:38.484 --> 10:39.815
What now?

10:39.817 --> 10:41.550
I mean, you could talk to
him now,

10:41.552 --> 10:43.119
but he's gonna ask again
once we're in the air.

10:43.121 --> 10:44.855
- I know.
- <i>Mr. Parker,</i>

10:44.857 --> 10:46.823
<i>I'm afraid we have to deny
your request for takeoff</i>

10:46.825 --> 10:48.757
- <i>if you do not...</i>
- Ground control,

10:48.759 --> 10:51.696
this is Kyle Parker speaking,
co-pilot of this flight.

10:52.830 --> 10:55.197
Screw it, I'll fly with you.
I was gonna come out

10:55.199 --> 10:57.332
to the West Coast
in three days anyway.

10:57.334 --> 10:59.268
<i>Thank you, FJ2244.</i>

10:59.270 --> 11:00.804
<i>You are cleared
for departure.</i>

11:00.806 --> 11:02.706
<i>Proceed to taxi lane.</i>

11:02.708 --> 11:06.642
Kyle, Kyle man,
how can I ever thank you?

11:06.644 --> 11:09.444
This would've ruined
everything.

11:09.446 --> 11:11.380
Hey, you know, this thing
with you and Lisa,

11:11.382 --> 11:13.182
it's over right?

11:13.184 --> 11:15.519
I mean, it was nothing
serious anyway, was it?

11:15.521 --> 11:18.621
Are you kidding?
Seriously, it was nothing.

11:18.623 --> 11:21.322
Besides, I'll be out of your
hair as soon as we hit L.A.

11:21.324 --> 11:23.461
Hey, bro.

11:24.929 --> 11:26.928
Merry Christmas.

11:26.930 --> 11:28.767
To you too, Matt.

11:29.934 --> 11:32.504
- Bathroom door's at the back?
- Right.

11:49.319 --> 11:50.790
What is this supposed to
mean?

11:52.556 --> 11:54.557
Lisa, I didn't want you
to see that.

11:54.559 --> 11:56.796
Just... forget about it,
okay?

11:59.229 --> 12:00.796
No, Kyle,
you'll tell me why

12:00.798 --> 12:04.265
you never answered
any of my calls right now.

12:04.267 --> 12:06.839
I have a right to know.
Tell me.

12:08.472 --> 12:11.472
You told me you had no
idea who I was, right?

12:11.474 --> 12:13.475
I mean, when we
first met at that party,

12:13.477 --> 12:18.246
you said you had no idea my
family owned Parker Industries.

12:18.248 --> 12:20.282
Yeah, I suppose so.

12:20.284 --> 12:23.752
That's not what your
friend Becca told me.

12:23.754 --> 12:25.789
So after a weekend
of feeling closer

12:25.791 --> 12:28.389
than I ever felt to any girl,

12:28.391 --> 12:30.960
I had to find out
that Becca told you in advance

12:30.962 --> 12:32.528
who was going to that party.

12:32.530 --> 12:33.962
That kind of thing

12:33.964 --> 12:35.597
just happened
too often in my life.

12:35.599 --> 12:37.533
What?
Are you trying to say that...

12:37.535 --> 12:39.301
You knew who I was
when we met.

12:39.303 --> 12:40.904
I didn't!
Becca mentioned

12:40.906 --> 12:42.705
so many people who were
coming to that party,

12:42.707 --> 12:45.844
by the time I arrived,
I didn't know anyone.

12:50.247 --> 12:52.748
Fine, if you really think
I was with you

12:52.750 --> 12:54.917
just because you're rich,

12:54.919 --> 12:58.757
you're an even bigger
asshole than I thought.

13:02.325 --> 13:03.694
Lisa...

13:09.266 --> 13:11.366
<i>But hasn't the world
in general</i>

13:11.368 --> 13:13.402
<i>become a much safer place
since the end of the Cold War?</i>

13:13.404 --> 13:15.537
<i>Just remember
those massive forces,</i>

13:15.539 --> 13:16.971
<i>the Russians
and the Americans...</i>

13:16.973 --> 13:18.673
<i>But do you really
feel better,</i>

13:18.675 --> 13:21.043
<i>with those massive weapons</i>

13:21.045 --> 13:23.779
<i>repeatedly showing up
on the black market...</i>

13:23.781 --> 13:25.047
Sound's there,
but wrong input.

13:25.049 --> 13:26.849
Yeah, I can hear that.

13:26.851 --> 13:29.784
<i>In this world,
terrible things can happen</i>

13:29.786 --> 13:32.020
- <i>any day.</i>
- You're damn right, honey,

13:32.022 --> 13:34.822
which is why we should
party as long as we can.

14:22.339 --> 14:24.776
I've always wanted
to do this.

14:36.886 --> 14:38.886
- Oh, yeah.
- Ohh!

14:38.888 --> 14:41.057
Oh, yeah.

14:41.559 --> 14:42.727
- Ohh...
- Ah!

14:51.502 --> 14:53.671
He wants to talk to you.

15:02.111 --> 15:03.711
Hey.

15:03.713 --> 15:04.979
Hey.

15:04.981 --> 15:06.414
Wanna take a seat?

15:06.416 --> 15:07.950
Yeah.

15:11.020 --> 15:12.888
How are you?

15:12.890 --> 15:14.122
Good, thanks.

15:14.124 --> 15:16.957
I, uh...
I'm just a little tired.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.595
Well, if you can keep your
eyes open a little longer,

15:19.597 --> 15:22.028
there's something
you might wanna see,

15:22.030 --> 15:23.767
right over there.

15:31.709 --> 15:33.712
So beautiful.

15:34.678 --> 15:36.412
Put your hands on the yoke.

15:36.414 --> 15:37.712
Excuse me?

15:37.714 --> 15:39.447
The stick.

15:39.449 --> 15:40.849
The controls.

15:40.851 --> 15:43.017
Oh...
No, no, really.

15:43.019 --> 15:44.889
- I, uh...
- Come on, it's easy.

15:56.467 --> 15:59.033
You see,
there's nothing to it.

16:00.771 --> 16:03.037
Now push it forward
just a little bit.

16:10.045 --> 16:13.150
Now try moving
a little to the right.

16:22.058 --> 16:24.529
This is like a dream.

16:37.574 --> 16:38.742
Phew.

16:40.510 --> 16:42.646
What's up with him?

16:47.617 --> 16:49.787
Autopilot's running now.

16:52.054 --> 16:54.055
Thank you so much.

16:54.057 --> 16:57.826
Honestly, I've never seen
anything as beautiful as this.

16:57.828 --> 16:59.664
Me neither.

17:09.037 --> 17:11.003
What's wrong?

17:11.006 --> 17:13.773
I'm sorry, Matt really,
it's just,

17:13.776 --> 17:15.175
I guess I'll just feel
a lot better

17:15.178 --> 17:17.613
when we get rid of your
brother in L.A.

17:19.147 --> 17:21.715
Shit, I'm sorry, no really,

17:21.718 --> 17:23.887
please don't take this
the wrong way.

17:27.790 --> 17:30.090
No, it's... it's fine.

17:30.092 --> 17:32.659
I totally understand,
you know,

17:32.661 --> 17:36.664
and in a few hours
we'll be on earth again.

17:36.666 --> 17:38.632
Yeah.

17:38.634 --> 17:40.169
Thank you.

17:41.872 --> 17:44.174
I'll go get some rest.

18:00.657 --> 18:03.824
Look,
I can see the sun again.

18:03.826 --> 18:05.158
You're right.

18:05.160 --> 18:06.929
How's that possible?

18:07.831 --> 18:09.831
We're chasing the sunset

18:09.833 --> 18:11.867
'cause we're heading west.

18:11.869 --> 18:15.770
Man, this is one fast
airplane.

18:15.772 --> 18:17.705
I think I'ma take
flying lessons too.

18:17.707 --> 18:19.709
Odin.

18:20.743 --> 18:22.810
Isn't that the name of a god?

18:22.812 --> 18:24.978
It is.
It's the name

18:24.980 --> 18:27.681
of a powerful
African god, actually.

18:27.683 --> 18:30.650
God I agree, but African?

18:30.652 --> 18:32.186
I thought he was European.

18:32.188 --> 18:34.088
No, no, no,
it's African.

18:34.090 --> 18:36.157
I know it for sure.
My parents told me.

18:36.159 --> 18:38.325
No, now I remember.

18:38.327 --> 18:41.361
Odin is a major god
in Norse mythology.

18:41.363 --> 18:42.698
He's Swedish.

18:43.632 --> 18:46.199
What?
Swedish?

18:46.201 --> 18:48.604
You mean like those
blonde guys?

18:50.773 --> 18:52.907
Okay, Lisa,
you almost got me.

18:52.909 --> 18:56.612
Not bad, but please,
don't make fun of that.

19:03.018 --> 19:05.052
No way. No, I'ma Google
that shit right now, man.

19:05.054 --> 19:07.254
That's not even funny.

19:07.256 --> 19:09.389
Swedish man.
He ain't Swedish.

19:09.391 --> 19:11.658
Someone's parents
got something wrong.

19:11.660 --> 19:13.260
He is not...

19:18.634 --> 19:20.032
What happened?

19:20.034 --> 19:21.836
- Kyle.
- What's happening?

19:21.838 --> 19:23.740
I don't know.

19:30.044 --> 19:32.780
The speed and altitude
are unchanged.

19:32.782 --> 19:34.947
Primary navigation's
still working.

19:34.949 --> 19:36.850
Alarm's coming from
the radar.

19:36.852 --> 19:38.418
Looks like it's offline.

19:38.420 --> 19:40.086
So is TCAS.

19:43.191 --> 19:45.859
Great, now we can't locate
other planes around us.

19:45.861 --> 19:47.293
Whoa, wait.
But they can still

19:47.295 --> 19:48.728
locate us, right?

19:48.730 --> 19:50.263
I mean, before they hit us.

19:50.265 --> 19:52.332
Right, right, it's
nothing to worry about.

19:52.334 --> 19:55.269
Ground control,
this is FJ2244.

19:55.271 --> 19:56.904
Do you copy, ground?

19:56.906 --> 19:59.039
It's dead.

19:59.041 --> 20:01.278
Can't even change channels.

20:03.345 --> 20:05.014
Cell's dead too.

20:08.685 --> 20:12.352
Mine's still working but...
there's no signal.

20:12.354 --> 20:15.955
Same here.
What does that mean?

20:15.957 --> 20:17.425
Well, I don't know what's
happened to the phones.

20:17.427 --> 20:19.760
That actually seems
kinda random.

20:19.762 --> 20:21.060
But as far as
the plane's concerned,

20:21.062 --> 20:22.227
it might just be
a short circuit

20:22.229 --> 20:23.863
in the main electric system.

20:23.865 --> 20:25.800
Get back to your seats.
We're gonna land.

20:25.802 --> 20:28.468
No, wait, let me check
the circuitry first.

20:28.470 --> 20:32.308
If I can't locate the
problem, then we'll land.

20:36.845 --> 20:38.846
Matt, don't you think
it's safer to set down

20:38.848 --> 20:40.747
and figure it out
on the ground?

20:40.749 --> 20:42.182
Well, if it's just
a short circuit,

20:42.184 --> 20:44.083
I can switch to secondary
immediately.

20:44.085 --> 20:45.918
Then there is no problem.
And since navigation's

20:45.920 --> 20:48.224
not affected, we're in no
immediate danger, right?

21:02.169 --> 21:06.108
What is this TCAS
you were talking about?

21:07.208 --> 21:08.974
Uh, it stands for,
uh, Traffic Alert

21:08.976 --> 21:11.144
and Collision Avoidance
System.

21:11.146 --> 21:14.114
<i>Every plane sends out a signal
that the other planes receive</i>

21:14.116 --> 21:17.050
<i>letting them know when they
get too close to each other.</i>

21:17.052 --> 21:19.418
That way you avoid mid-air
collisions.

21:19.420 --> 21:22.222
But, we're not sending
that signal anymore.

21:22.224 --> 21:24.792
Right, but, uh...
we should still appear

21:24.794 --> 21:27.060
on the other planes'
radar systems, so...

21:28.464 --> 21:30.029
Everything all right
down there?

21:30.031 --> 21:32.397
<i>Yeah,
just removed the casing.</i>

21:44.178 --> 21:47.149
Guys, take a look at this.

21:50.185 --> 21:52.085
Impressive.

21:52.087 --> 21:54.854
Looks like quite a thunder
storm going on down there.

21:54.856 --> 21:57.290
Oh, and that might
explain the random failure

21:57.292 --> 21:59.158
of our electrical devices.

21:59.160 --> 22:01.226
Really?
How's that?

22:01.228 --> 22:05.130
Lightning can cause a sudden
change in magnetic fields,

22:05.132 --> 22:07.834
creating an electromagnetic
pulse,

22:07.836 --> 22:11.874
and these can overcharge
sensitive electrical equipment.

22:13.975 --> 22:16.176
That should do it.

22:16.178 --> 22:18.947
Let's hope that works.

22:27.488 --> 22:30.522
Please, I mean no harm.

22:30.524 --> 22:33.993
<i>Odin, get down here...
now!</i>

22:42.904 --> 22:44.905
- Matt, what's going on?
- Matt? Odin?

22:44.907 --> 22:46.939
<i>Move!</i>

22:52.013 --> 22:53.448
Up here.

22:59.321 --> 23:00.954
Kyle, go check if the
instruments are working again.

23:00.956 --> 23:03.322
I switched the circuitry.

23:03.324 --> 23:04.526
Move!

23:05.994 --> 23:08.093
Who's this?

23:16.403 --> 23:18.204
<i>Radar back online.</i>

23:18.206 --> 23:19.973
<i>It looks like it's damaged.</i>

23:19.975 --> 23:22.975
<i>TCAS and radio
still completely dead.</i>

23:22.977 --> 23:25.544
What have you done to
our plane, motherfucker?

23:25.546 --> 23:29.314
Please, I didn't sabotage
anything, believe me.

23:29.316 --> 23:32.284
How did you get
aboard?

23:32.286 --> 23:34.856
I got on
right after... he landed.

23:36.024 --> 23:37.956
I was looking for some food

23:37.958 --> 23:42.328
and then the jet was suddenly
locked from the outside

23:42.330 --> 23:44.030
and soon after that,

23:44.032 --> 23:45.935
you all entered
and we started.

23:48.069 --> 23:51.204
Please,
can I introduce myself?

23:51.206 --> 23:53.509
My name's Erik, Erik Harris.

23:54.676 --> 23:56.509
Come on guys,
go easy on him.

23:56.511 --> 23:58.280
Where's he gonna go?

24:05.587 --> 24:07.287
Please, can I have
something to drink?

24:07.289 --> 24:09.954
The air down there
is really bad.

24:09.956 --> 24:12.524
Looking for food could not
have been the only reason

24:12.526 --> 24:14.295
to enter an airport area.

24:16.964 --> 24:20.269
You were trying to board
a plane, right?

24:22.303 --> 24:24.936
It's true I have some
problems with the authorities

24:24.938 --> 24:27.272
back in New York,
but, uh...

24:27.274 --> 24:29.442
can't you just let me go

24:29.444 --> 24:31.711
once we arrive
in Los Angeles, and...

24:31.713 --> 24:33.378
you'll never see me again.

24:33.380 --> 24:35.147
Look, even if
I wanted to help you,

24:35.149 --> 24:37.183
without radio and TCAS
there's no alternative

24:37.185 --> 24:39.252
to landing immediately.

24:39.254 --> 24:41.052
Kyle,
where's the closest airport?

24:41.054 --> 24:42.524
Should be Chicago.

24:43.524 --> 24:45.224
Come on,
there is nothing wrong

24:45.226 --> 24:48.593
with our navigation system,
is there?

24:48.595 --> 24:50.463
Sorry, man,

24:50.465 --> 24:52.063
looks like
you got on the wrong plane.

24:52.065 --> 24:53.934
Haven't I seen you
before somewhere?

24:55.736 --> 24:58.236
Hey!

24:58.238 --> 24:59.705
Oh, shit!

25:04.713 --> 25:06.713
What's your name, son?

25:11.150 --> 25:14.389
My name's... Matt.

25:15.457 --> 25:16.991
Matt.

25:18.560 --> 25:21.158
This plane stays skybound.

25:21.160 --> 25:24.096
It will not alter course,
nor altitude.

25:24.098 --> 25:26.197
Is that understood?

25:26.199 --> 25:29.368
Look, since we don't know
the cause of the malfunction,

25:29.370 --> 25:31.136
it'd be far too dangerous
to continue this flight.

25:31.138 --> 25:33.004
Don't worry about it.

25:33.006 --> 25:37.409
As long as navigation works,
everything is fine.

25:37.411 --> 25:39.176
Lisa, I'm scared.

25:39.178 --> 25:40.177
Sit down!
[slap

25:40.179 --> 25:42.281
You bastard!

25:44.351 --> 25:45.518
No!

25:57.063 --> 25:58.531
Get me the first aid kit!

25:58.533 --> 26:00.532
We gotta stop the bleeding
immediately.

26:02.771 --> 26:04.305
Here!

26:09.408 --> 26:10.443
I don't think the bullet
hit an organ,

26:10.445 --> 26:12.645
but we gotta get to a hospital
as soon as possible.

26:12.647 --> 26:15.183
I'll set a course
for Chicago right away.

26:16.215 --> 26:18.050
Damn, this hurts.

26:18.052 --> 26:20.656
Stay calm.
You're gonna be okay.

26:22.055 --> 26:24.188
You lunatic.

26:32.099 --> 26:33.333
Okay, Buddy.

26:41.175 --> 26:43.107
This is for your pain.

26:43.109 --> 26:44.476
Wait a minute.

26:44.478 --> 26:46.512
How can we land without radio,

26:46.514 --> 26:48.146
radar and all that?

26:48.148 --> 26:50.715
It's okay.

26:50.717 --> 26:52.184
As soon as
we appear on their radar

26:52.186 --> 26:53.820
being unreachable by radio,

26:53.822 --> 26:56.856
ground control will withdraw
the landing permissions

26:56.858 --> 26:58.793
for all the other planes.

27:01.494 --> 27:03.130
What's going on?

27:04.698 --> 27:06.566
We're not landing,
are we?

27:07.635 --> 27:09.434
Yes, we are landing,

27:09.436 --> 27:10.802
and you're gonna be
locked up for what you did

27:10.804 --> 27:13.338
to my friend,
<i>hijo de puta!</i>

27:24.651 --> 27:26.350
Oh, shit!

27:26.352 --> 27:29.154
Uhh...
Matt, what's going on?

27:29.156 --> 27:31.724
<i>Some plane
almost crashed into us.</i>

27:38.867 --> 27:40.435
Look at that.

27:41.635 --> 27:43.534
They must've had us on their
radar for quite some time

27:43.536 --> 27:46.137
if all those planes
are stayin' up for us.

27:49.710 --> 27:52.814
I've never seen anything
like this.

27:54.680 --> 27:56.915
Look, those two
just got really close.

27:56.917 --> 27:58.818
I-is that normal?

27:58.820 --> 28:02.521
Do you think it's because
of the holiday traffic?

28:02.523 --> 28:04.688
Kyle, God damn it,
you can't move around.

28:04.690 --> 28:06.593
Get back and sit down.

28:07.561 --> 28:09.226
Something's wrong here.

28:09.228 --> 28:10.830
We should've appeared

28:10.832 --> 28:12.463
on that
plane's positioning system.

28:12.465 --> 28:14.432
They must've
simply overlooked us.

28:14.434 --> 28:15.868
It can happen in crowded
airspace like this.

28:15.870 --> 28:17.904
- Kyle, come back here!
- But look...

28:17.906 --> 28:20.504
they're all flying
way too close to each other.

28:20.506 --> 28:24.643
I mean, this just doesn't look
like supervised airspace.

28:24.645 --> 28:26.411
What are you trying to say?

28:26.413 --> 28:28.914
I really hope
I'm wrong but...

28:28.916 --> 28:30.482
what if we're not
the only ones

28:30.484 --> 28:32.650
with malfunctioning
collision avoidance?

28:45.331 --> 28:47.331
But that's impossible!

28:47.333 --> 28:48.966
A failure
of positioning systems

28:48.968 --> 28:52.270
on multiple planes
at the same time?

28:52.272 --> 28:54.271
Maybe some of the planes
were affected

28:54.273 --> 28:57.375
by the electromagnetic pulses
from the thunderstorm too.

28:57.377 --> 29:01.879
I mean, there aren't any
walls to pass through, right?

29:08.321 --> 29:09.788
Oh, my God.

29:09.790 --> 29:11.325
Holy shit.

29:13.327 --> 29:15.527
All those people.

29:15.529 --> 29:17.261
Matt, I don't know
what's going on

29:17.263 --> 29:18.629
but let's get
out of here now.

29:18.631 --> 29:20.698
He's right, we should climb.

29:20.700 --> 29:22.701
Trying to land here is nuts.

29:22.703 --> 29:24.903
I'll set a course to
the closest airport.

29:24.905 --> 29:26.838
It can't be far.

29:26.840 --> 29:28.772
No, wait,
that's probably where

29:28.774 --> 29:29.940
most of the others
will be heading too.

29:29.942 --> 29:31.775
We should aim farther afield.

29:31.777 --> 29:34.214
Okay, just let me get
outta here first, all right?

29:51.564 --> 29:52.896
So just to let everyone know,

29:52.898 --> 29:55.367
I've set a course
for Kansas City.

29:55.369 --> 29:57.368
We'll be landing in an hour.

29:57.370 --> 29:59.002
And there's a hospital
there too.

29:59.004 --> 30:00.408
Awesome.

30:02.775 --> 30:04.644
Try to get some rest
before we land.

30:05.579 --> 30:08.382
I think your temperature's
elevated.

30:09.349 --> 30:11.316
Let's see
what the news says

30:11.318 --> 30:12.550
about what's happening
in Chicago.

30:12.552 --> 30:13.788
Good idea.

30:19.892 --> 30:22.729
Damn, there's no
signal anywhere.

30:23.863 --> 30:26.399
Leave it on.
Maybe it'll come back.

30:28.668 --> 30:30.534
Guys, I've been thinking.

30:30.536 --> 30:33.069
What if all those planes
didn't actually want to land?

30:33.071 --> 30:35.874
Like if there was an emergency
down in Chicago airport?

30:35.876 --> 30:38.975
Right, like if some
terrorist just got caught.

30:38.977 --> 30:40.878
I heard they'd shut down
the entire airport then.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.746
Oh, what, and all
the positioning systems

30:42.748 --> 30:44.883
on all the planes fail
at the same time?

30:44.885 --> 30:46.818
I mean that's a bit of a
coincidence, don't you think?

30:46.820 --> 30:48.419
I heard some touched us, too.

30:48.421 --> 30:50.022
You shut the fuck up,
all right?

30:53.427 --> 30:54.629
Kyle!

30:55.594 --> 30:58.095
What's happening to him?

30:58.097 --> 30:59.664
We have to go back and land.

30:59.666 --> 31:01.366
But... why?

31:01.368 --> 31:04.903
The bullet... it must've
caused an infection.

31:04.905 --> 31:06.738
If it's not removed right away

31:06.740 --> 31:08.609
it could go septic,
and he could die.

31:10.409 --> 31:14.346
You can't land in Chicago.
It's far too dangerous.

31:14.348 --> 31:16.447
Is there really
no other way?

31:16.449 --> 31:18.415
No, there isn't.

31:18.417 --> 31:20.084
But can't you take the
bullet out yourself, Lisa?

31:20.086 --> 31:23.521
I mean, if we go back,
we could all die, right?

31:23.523 --> 31:24.755
She's right.

31:24.757 --> 31:26.393
Going back would be suicide.

31:27.828 --> 31:29.661
Roxy, I'm in my third
semester in medicine.

31:29.663 --> 31:31.362
I'm not a surgeon!

31:34.767 --> 31:37.003
I'm not gonna let
my brother die.

31:40.706 --> 31:42.138
What do you think
you're doing?

31:42.140 --> 31:44.709
I'm sorry man,
but we can't turn around.

31:44.711 --> 31:46.677
You know that.

31:46.679 --> 31:48.780
- Are you out of your mind?
- You want to put us all

31:48.782 --> 31:50.914
- in danger?
- Can't you at least try, Lisa?

31:50.916 --> 31:53.620
But I've never done
anything like this before.

31:59.391 --> 32:00.892
- Matt!
- He's my brother,

32:00.894 --> 32:02.694
- for Christ's sake.
- Matt, Matt, calm down!

32:02.696 --> 32:04.161
Calm down!

32:04.163 --> 32:06.933
You'd do the same
in my position.

32:09.401 --> 32:12.371
So now...
it's all down to Lisa.

32:13.840 --> 32:15.706
I trust you Lisa.

32:15.708 --> 32:18.011
You can do it.

32:23.916 --> 32:25.849
All right...

32:25.851 --> 32:28.418
let's prepare
a space in the back.

32:31.725 --> 32:34.057
Let's see what else we have.

32:34.059 --> 32:37.027
There's some bandages.
That's good.

32:37.029 --> 32:39.530
And this pair of
plastic tweezers.

32:39.532 --> 32:42.532
And alcohol sterilization.

32:44.069 --> 32:45.770
Keep the plane still, Matt!

32:45.772 --> 32:48.041
<i>I'm trying...
it's the weather.</i>

32:48.907 --> 32:50.642
I hope this doesn't happen

32:50.644 --> 32:52.175
while I'm pulling
the bullet out of his wound.

32:52.177 --> 32:53.577
Right.

32:53.579 --> 32:55.813
Okay, get to work on that.

33:03.857 --> 33:05.826
Okay.

33:07.592 --> 33:11.094
This is gonna sting
a little.

33:11.096 --> 33:13.062
Uhh...

33:13.064 --> 33:15.933
I think I can see
the bullet.

33:15.935 --> 33:17.501
I'm gonna start now,
okay Kyle?

33:27.079 --> 33:28.580
Oh, shit.

33:30.817 --> 33:33.453
Oh, stick it in me,
will you?

33:36.021 --> 33:37.186
Ohh!

33:37.188 --> 33:38.590
Ohh...

33:42.227 --> 33:43.760
Oh!

33:43.762 --> 33:45.628
Damn,
this thing's slippery.

33:51.637 --> 33:53.103
Okay, got it.

33:53.105 --> 33:54.607
Hand me the knife.

33:57.843 --> 33:59.943
This will close the wound.

34:18.530 --> 34:20.166
Your fever's dropped.

34:28.572 --> 34:30.239
So how'd I do?

34:30.242 --> 34:33.109
You're gonna be okay.

34:33.110 --> 34:36.045
I knew you could do it.

34:36.047 --> 34:37.981
Now you can call yourself
a real doctor.

34:41.920 --> 34:43.522
Kyle...

34:46.690 --> 34:48.225
There hasn't
really been a chance

34:48.226 --> 34:50.992
for me to say... thank you.

34:53.697 --> 34:55.199
For saving my life.

34:56.568 --> 34:59.136
Looks like you just
returned the favor.

35:05.743 --> 35:08.678
Lisa...

35:08.680 --> 35:10.180
I want to apologize

35:10.182 --> 35:13.816
for the way I was last year.

35:13.818 --> 35:17.256
I was all wrong about you.
I see that now.

35:21.225 --> 35:22.695
Funny.

35:24.929 --> 35:27.897
For a moment there
I thought...

35:27.899 --> 35:30.034
she's your girl.

35:34.872 --> 35:36.740
You guys better get ready.

35:36.742 --> 35:39.011
Be landing in a few minutes.

35:40.211 --> 35:43.012
Matt, wait.
Don't you think it's safer

35:43.014 --> 35:44.781
if I sit in the co-pilot
seat for landing?

35:44.783 --> 35:47.182
Whoa, cowboy,
you need to get some rest.

35:47.184 --> 35:49.352
I know, it's just...

35:49.354 --> 35:51.888
given our situation,

35:51.890 --> 35:54.357
I think it'd be safer to have
the second pilot in place

35:54.359 --> 35:57.927
just in case anything
unexpected happened.

35:57.929 --> 36:00.330
He's right.

36:00.332 --> 36:03.099
I'll carry him through.

36:11.241 --> 36:14.613
Wow...
weather is getting rougher.

36:16.047 --> 36:18.682
So how's things
with you and Lisa?

36:18.684 --> 36:20.215
What? What do you mean?

36:20.217 --> 36:22.920
They say an old flame
never dies, right?

36:23.987 --> 36:26.356
Excuse me?
What are you talking about?

36:26.358 --> 36:28.792
Lisa's here with you.
I'm fully aware of that.

36:28.794 --> 36:30.092
Oh, come on,
even the stowaway noticed

36:30.094 --> 36:32.796
- what's going on.
- Really?

36:32.798 --> 36:34.967
So what <i>is</i> going on, Matt?

36:52.916 --> 36:54.850
You're being ridiculous.

36:54.852 --> 36:56.752
Let's just say I would
appreciate it

36:56.754 --> 36:59.221
if you stay away from Lisa
for the rest of this...

36:59.223 --> 37:01.758
- journey.
- Matt, take a look at that.

37:01.760 --> 37:04.664
That's way too warm for
this altitude, isn't it?

37:05.731 --> 37:07.863
Display must be
malfunctioning as well.

37:07.865 --> 37:09.832
Temperature's still rising.

37:09.834 --> 37:11.767
It's now reaching 30 degrees.

37:11.769 --> 37:14.738
Hey, can we talk?

37:14.740 --> 37:16.872
I need to tell you something.
It's important.

37:16.874 --> 37:18.342
Odin, accompany him.

37:32.924 --> 37:34.725
What do you have to say?

37:34.727 --> 37:36.458
I've been thinking...

37:36.460 --> 37:39.796
what if something actually
has happened on the ground,

37:39.798 --> 37:42.899
I mean something big,
like a natural disaster,

37:42.901 --> 37:45.868
a volcanic eruption,
for example?

37:45.870 --> 37:48.772
Bullshit. We would've
seen that in Chicago.

37:48.774 --> 37:51.373
Temperature
now at 60 degrees.

37:51.375 --> 37:53.208
What the fuck?
This is the middle of winter

37:53.210 --> 37:55.043
and we're still miles
above the ground.

37:55.045 --> 37:57.179
- It must be a malfunction.
- What if it's not?

37:57.181 --> 37:59.914
What if it's not such
a good idea to land here?

37:59.916 --> 38:01.416
Oh, no man,
not a second time.

38:01.418 --> 38:03.119
I am gonna land this plane
right now,

38:03.121 --> 38:04.487
no matter what.

38:04.489 --> 38:06.756
Whatever is wrong
on the ground...

38:06.758 --> 38:08.825
what if we're actually
flying closer to it

38:08.827 --> 38:10.996
instead of away from it?

38:14.132 --> 38:15.965
100 degrees and rising?

38:18.268 --> 38:21.336
Matt...

38:21.338 --> 38:23.338
I think Erik
might have a point.

38:23.340 --> 38:25.808
Maybe we should climb.

38:25.810 --> 38:27.175
Matt!

38:27.177 --> 38:29.447
Matt, let's climb!

38:31.215 --> 38:32.280
Matt!

38:32.282 --> 38:33.885
I'm taking over.

38:38.556 --> 38:40.356
What the hell was that thing?

38:40.358 --> 38:42.123
What's happening?

38:42.125 --> 38:43.458
- Aren't we landing?
- That much light

38:43.460 --> 38:45.561
can only come from
an explosion

38:45.563 --> 38:48.832
or forest fires...

38:48.834 --> 38:51.000
or...

38:51.002 --> 38:52.868
I have no fucking idea.

38:52.870 --> 38:56.005
Why not some large area
natural disaster?

38:56.007 --> 38:59.375
There are a lot of volcanoes
in the United States.

38:59.377 --> 39:00.411
What?

39:03.881 --> 39:06.215
Is that really possible?

39:06.217 --> 39:09.451
Look, the turbulence
is dying down.

39:09.453 --> 39:12.121
As soon as we get far
enough away from here,

39:12.123 --> 39:13.922
I'm gonna land this plane
wherever I can.

39:13.924 --> 39:16.525
Military airport,
mall parking lot... I don't care.

39:16.527 --> 39:19.394
I really think
it's important

39:19.396 --> 39:21.297
not to freak out right now.

39:21.299 --> 39:24.266
So far as long as we've
stayed up in the air,

39:24.268 --> 39:27.101
nothing has happened to us,
right?

39:27.103 --> 39:28.570
He's right.

39:28.572 --> 39:31.106
We need to stay calm.

39:31.108 --> 39:33.943
After all,
we filled up for L.A. right?

39:33.945 --> 39:36.579
So we're not gonna run
out of fuel anytime soon.

39:36.581 --> 39:39.248
For all we know,
some explosion or forest fire

39:39.250 --> 39:41.115
happened in Kansas City,

39:41.117 --> 39:42.284
or maybe there was
a connection

39:42.286 --> 39:44.052
with what we saw in Chicago.

39:44.054 --> 39:46.021
But either way,
we still have enough fuel

39:46.023 --> 39:49.294
to get far away
from this whole area.

40:15.952 --> 40:19.221
Where's the little ticker thing
at the bottom of the screen?

40:19.223 --> 40:22.194
The one with all the stock
information?

40:23.661 --> 40:27.432
Why aren't they
reporting on... on anything?

40:28.900 --> 40:32.134
But... Christmas is over,
isn't it?

40:32.136 --> 40:33.271
It is.

40:44.648 --> 40:46.250
Fuck!

40:58.060 --> 41:00.632
December 26th
and December 27th.

41:03.033 --> 41:05.668
Here. Right now I guess
it's crucial to find out

41:05.670 --> 41:07.536
what happened on the ground.

41:07.538 --> 41:11.138
And since we don't have
the net, or any televised news,

41:11.140 --> 41:15.244
maybe we can find some hints
in these papers my Dad left.

41:15.246 --> 41:16.977
But they're from yesterday.

41:16.979 --> 41:19.380
Do you think they predicted
the future?

41:19.382 --> 41:20.715
Maybe there have been
some weather forecasts,

41:20.717 --> 41:23.017
tornado warnings
or something.

41:23.019 --> 41:24.017
Or military tests
or maneuvers

41:24.019 --> 41:25.621
scheduled in the area.

41:25.623 --> 41:28.324
Or a political crisis
threatening to break out.

41:28.326 --> 41:30.362
Good point.
Let me help you.

41:46.677 --> 41:48.677
The fashion part?

41:48.679 --> 41:50.579
Baby, we're looking
for natural disasters.

41:50.581 --> 41:52.312
Not fashion disasters.

41:52.314 --> 41:53.648
Look at this!

41:53.650 --> 41:56.084
I'm about to have
a nervous breakdown.

41:56.086 --> 41:58.923
I need something
to calm me down.

42:37.426 --> 42:40.498
Matt,
take a look at this.

42:42.365 --> 42:44.565
Did you guys find something?

42:51.274 --> 42:54.144
Nice to meet you, Mr. Lamar

42:56.446 --> 42:59.651
Lamar?
You said your name was Harris.

43:02.820 --> 43:04.384
Head of a religious movement

43:04.386 --> 43:07.120
that believes in
the apocalypse.

43:07.122 --> 43:10.126
His real name is Erik Lamar.

43:11.628 --> 43:13.997
I knew I seen your face
before.

43:15.598 --> 43:17.632
It says the FBI's been
after him ever since

43:17.634 --> 43:20.468
plans of an assault came to
their attention last Wednesday.

43:20.470 --> 43:22.637
What?
You piece of shit.

43:22.639 --> 43:25.305
Are you the reason
behind all this madness?

43:25.307 --> 43:27.607
I'm not.
How could I?

43:27.609 --> 43:32.212
Each time we try to land,
you try to stop us.

43:32.214 --> 43:34.750
You wanted to keep this
plane in the air at any cost.

43:34.752 --> 43:36.551
Why?

43:36.553 --> 43:38.553
Is it 'cause you know
we'll die down there?

43:38.555 --> 43:39.822
What?

43:39.824 --> 43:41.757
You must be out of your mind.

43:41.759 --> 43:43.290
Did you bastards
cause an explosion

43:43.292 --> 43:44.793
or diffuse a virus
or something?

43:44.795 --> 43:46.829
Is that why all those planes

43:46.831 --> 43:49.663
didn't want to land
back in Chicago?

43:49.665 --> 43:51.232
You snuck aboard
because you knew

43:51.234 --> 43:52.667
that only up here
you'd be safe.

43:52.669 --> 43:54.802
No.

43:54.804 --> 43:56.636
You must believe me,
I-I...

43:56.638 --> 44:00.241
I just wanted to make
money with that sect.

44:00.243 --> 44:02.310
I was good at talking
and my followers,

44:02.312 --> 44:04.712
they kept donating...

44:04.714 --> 44:06.513
and I myself never believed

44:06.515 --> 44:08.549
in that apocalypse bullshit
at all.

44:08.551 --> 44:12.520
And... we never planned
any attack.

44:12.522 --> 44:14.122
I swear.

44:14.124 --> 44:15.723
Oh, right,
the FBI was just mistaken

44:15.725 --> 44:18.192
about that information.

44:18.194 --> 44:20.227
Yes.

44:20.229 --> 44:22.562
No.
Actually,

44:22.564 --> 44:25.135
it was all
a huge misunderstanding.

44:26.202 --> 44:29.236
Some of the members
got it all wrong

44:29.238 --> 44:31.471
and they started
trash talking online,

44:31.473 --> 44:36.145
and the FBI was monitoring it.

44:40.415 --> 44:43.350
There! Guys, I have to
tell you something.

44:43.352 --> 44:47.187
A moment ago I saw Lamar
checking his watch

44:47.189 --> 44:50.323
right before there was
a glow outside the window.

44:50.325 --> 44:53.861
I mean, as if he knew
exactly when to expect it.

44:53.863 --> 44:55.863
Man, you are dead.

44:55.865 --> 44:57.631
It's just a pulse watch.

44:57.633 --> 45:00.136
Please, I suffer from diabetes.

45:08.511 --> 45:11.279
It's true.
It's a pulse watch.

45:11.281 --> 45:14.947
It warns me when I get
too excited, you understand?

45:14.949 --> 45:16.584
To avoid seizures.

45:16.586 --> 45:18.252
That's why
I looked at it earlier.

45:18.254 --> 45:19.920
Oh, what a coincidence.

45:19.922 --> 45:21.689
It's already started.

45:21.691 --> 45:24.958
Please,
you know about the condition.

45:24.960 --> 45:27.562
Can I get some insulin
from my pack?

45:27.564 --> 45:29.566
It's still back
in that hatch.

45:31.901 --> 45:34.370
I can die if I don't get it.

45:35.705 --> 45:38.605
Right, I'll go with you.
Move!

45:38.607 --> 45:40.510
Thank you very much.

45:48.751 --> 45:50.787
So what do
you think of his story?

45:52.689 --> 45:55.259
He just might
be telling the truth.

45:56.292 --> 45:58.662
I just don't know what
to believe.

46:03.832 --> 46:05.700
<i>Move!</i>

46:10.607 --> 46:14.478
Do you think Lamar threw
this away to hide it from us?

46:15.978 --> 46:17.745
Move it.

46:22.285 --> 46:24.484
Oh, shit, listen to this.

46:24.486 --> 46:26.319
"Former sect members claim

46:26.321 --> 46:28.656
"that Lamar
fed them psychotropic drugs,

46:28.658 --> 46:30.956
"causing massive paranoia
and hallucinations

46:30.958 --> 46:34.729
"in order to impose
his will on them.

46:34.731 --> 46:36.830
"Upon consumption,
people believed that they were

46:36.832 --> 46:39.903
actually witnessing...
the end of the world."

46:41.504 --> 46:43.406
Holy shit!

46:46.808 --> 46:48.745
Give me that.

46:50.045 --> 46:51.879
We know all about you
and your drugs.

46:51.881 --> 46:53.613
What?

46:53.615 --> 46:55.582
Is this what made us
see and believe

46:55.584 --> 46:58.952
- all those frightening things?
- Honey, what do you mean?

46:58.954 --> 47:01.555
He gave hallucinogenic
drugs to members of his sect,

47:01.557 --> 47:04.357
making them think that the
end of the world was near.

47:04.359 --> 47:05.628
Look.

47:07.763 --> 47:09.996
Well, you must believe me,
I...

47:09.998 --> 47:12.767
I swear I didn't
give you anything.

47:12.769 --> 47:15.034
It's true we experimented

47:15.036 --> 47:17.404
with pharmaceuticals, LSD,
stuff like that,

47:17.406 --> 47:19.005
but I can assure you,

47:19.007 --> 47:21.374
none of us ever
experienced anything

47:21.376 --> 47:23.309
like we did during
this flight.

47:23.311 --> 47:25.010
Then why would you hide
that page?

47:25.012 --> 47:28.081
Guys,
this could be the explanation.

47:28.083 --> 47:31.451
It could finally be the
explanation for everything.

47:31.453 --> 47:33.052
I really hope you're right.

47:33.054 --> 47:34.821
Wait, hold on.

47:34.823 --> 47:36.489
How is he supposed to
have given us any drugs?

47:36.491 --> 47:38.324
Thank you.

47:38.326 --> 47:39.759
Well, he was in
the cargo bay area

47:39.761 --> 47:41.761
for a long time
before we found him.

47:41.763 --> 47:44.030
Down there it's easy to
infuse the air cycle machine

47:44.032 --> 47:46.634
with any sort of
foreign substance.

47:46.636 --> 47:50.006
But just why would I
do that?

47:51.440 --> 47:53.039
The air cycle machine?

47:53.041 --> 47:55.342
Well, planes create
an artificial pressure

47:55.344 --> 47:57.645
and temperature environment,
otherwise people

47:57.647 --> 47:59.879
wouldn't be able to survive
at such a high altitude.

47:59.881 --> 48:02.514
Think of the whole cabin
as a giant oxygen tank

48:02.516 --> 48:03.949
we all breathe from.

48:03.951 --> 48:05.819
It's true.

48:05.821 --> 48:07.721
I read about similar
experiments

48:07.723 --> 48:09.456
with hallucinogenic drugs
on airplanes.

48:09.458 --> 48:11.124
I heard enough.

48:11.126 --> 48:13.425
Hey, what are you doing
with that?

48:13.427 --> 48:15.796
- I need those!
- Odin, what are you doing?

48:15.798 --> 48:18.765
So much for your goddamn
drugs, you piece of shit.

48:26.907 --> 48:29.508
You just signed
my death warrant.

48:29.510 --> 48:30.976
Are you out of your mind?

48:30.978 --> 48:33.079
Don't worry Kyle,
he won't die.

48:33.081 --> 48:34.881
What Matt described
makes perfect sense.

48:34.883 --> 48:37.516
These must have been
the drugs we read about.

48:37.518 --> 48:39.552
Just how can you be sure
of that?

48:39.554 --> 48:40.821
You might have killed
the man.

48:40.823 --> 48:42.958
<i>He</i> might have killed you!

48:49.931 --> 48:53.400
All I wanted to do was

48:53.402 --> 48:55.872
cross the border to Mexico.

48:57.572 --> 48:59.474
Just cross the border.

49:01.711 --> 49:02.877
Hey!

49:02.879 --> 49:04.413
Hey.

49:06.514 --> 49:09.484
Don't fall asleep.

49:13.088 --> 49:15.054
He's going into a coma.

49:15.056 --> 49:17.657
Can't we give him some sweets
or something with sugar

49:17.659 --> 49:19.726
in case he didn't lie about
his condition?

49:19.728 --> 49:22.664
No, not while someone's
unconscious.

49:28.003 --> 49:30.870
Things can't be changed
anymore.

49:30.872 --> 49:32.572
Here's what we do.

49:32.574 --> 49:35.074
We exchange our cabin air,
now,

49:35.076 --> 49:39.179
before we try to land under the
possible influence of drugs.

49:39.181 --> 49:41.848
To be on the safe side.

49:41.850 --> 49:44.083
Exchange the air.
That's it, man.

49:44.085 --> 49:45.852
We'd have to release
the cabin pressure

49:45.854 --> 49:50.657
and open the emergency
exit at the same time.

49:50.659 --> 49:52.791
We'd have to descend
significantly for that.

49:52.793 --> 49:53.959
So?

49:53.961 --> 49:55.895
The turbulence is gone.

49:55.897 --> 49:58.597
I mean, if there ever were
was any in the first place.

49:58.599 --> 50:01.034
Kyle, you'll be the pilot.

50:01.036 --> 50:04.037
Odin and I will open
the emergency exit.

50:04.039 --> 50:07.109
Everyone else...
fasten your seat belts.

50:14.915 --> 50:16.583
All right,
ready when you are.

50:16.585 --> 50:18.083
Okay,
put it around your waist.

50:18.085 --> 50:19.885
Like this, see?

50:19.887 --> 50:22.021
This way we won't be sucked
out or something, right?

50:22.023 --> 50:24.523
Well, at this altitude
we won't anyway.

50:24.525 --> 50:27.594
It'll only be windy,
very windy.

50:27.596 --> 50:28.960
Okay, ladies, listen up.

50:28.962 --> 50:31.866
Just try breathing normally,
okay?

50:33.168 --> 50:35.635
Okay, here we go.
Kyle?

50:43.043 --> 50:44.579
Let's bring it in.

50:46.748 --> 50:48.113
Now!

51:03.231 --> 51:07.570
Why is the snow... hot?

51:11.939 --> 51:15.742
It's probably
just withdrawal symptoms.

51:15.744 --> 51:18.078
I experienced
something similar once.

51:24.318 --> 51:26.018
This is not snow!

51:26.020 --> 51:28.089
It's ash!

51:40.000 --> 51:42.635
He's dead.

51:42.637 --> 51:44.240
What?

51:47.140 --> 51:50.342
It's just like
a diabetic shock, he...

51:50.344 --> 51:52.345
He might've been telling
the truth all along, I...

51:52.347 --> 51:53.813
Come.

52:27.281 --> 52:30.885
What... is this?

52:34.187 --> 52:36.759
A nuclear explosion.

52:37.826 --> 52:40.659
But... couldn't this still be

52:40.661 --> 52:42.764
a hallucination from the drugs?

52:46.000 --> 52:47.302
No.

52:51.171 --> 52:53.073
I don't think so.

52:55.408 --> 52:58.011
We're at war.

53:17.430 --> 53:19.699
You think the aluminum hull

53:19.701 --> 53:22.370
could protect us from
radioactivity?

53:24.404 --> 53:26.040
I don't know.

53:28.142 --> 53:30.241
Maybe.

53:30.243 --> 53:32.614
What do you mean,
radioactivity?

53:34.381 --> 53:38.350
My cousin lives in Denver.
That's not far from here.

53:38.352 --> 53:41.355
I wanna land right now.
I wanna talk to her.

53:43.957 --> 53:45.691
I said land!

53:45.693 --> 53:48.292
Land this plane,
God damn it!

53:48.294 --> 53:49.896
I wanna talk to my family.

53:49.898 --> 53:51.997
Your cousin's dead,
Roxy!

53:51.999 --> 53:55.000
Dead, along with everyone
else within hundreds of miles.

53:55.002 --> 53:58.172
And we'll die too if we
even set foot on the ground.

53:59.238 --> 54:01.306
How can you be sure?

54:01.308 --> 54:03.809
You're not an expert, Matt.

54:03.811 --> 54:06.778
How can you even be sure
it's a nuclear explosion

54:06.780 --> 54:09.181
and not a hydrogen bomb
or whatever?

54:09.183 --> 54:11.653
That's a nuclear bomb
too.

54:12.786 --> 54:14.753
It even explains
the random failure

54:14.755 --> 54:16.987
of our electronic devices,
doesn't it?

54:16.989 --> 54:18.824
I mean, a blast like that

54:18.826 --> 54:20.324
sends out
electromagnetic pulses

54:20.326 --> 54:21.860
that could burst
sensitive equipment, right?

54:21.862 --> 54:25.129
No chance.
We were too far away.

54:25.131 --> 54:28.035
What if this isn't
the only one?

54:28.869 --> 54:31.402
That green glow sure looked
like what we saw underneath

54:31.404 --> 54:34.408
the clouds in Kansas,
and before even.

54:35.777 --> 54:38.243
They say that in
a nuclear explosion,

54:38.245 --> 54:41.980
everything inflames like
paper within seconds.

54:41.982 --> 54:45.116
For miles and miles and miles.

54:45.118 --> 54:47.486
Right, but there was
nothing in flames

54:47.488 --> 54:49.754
in Chicago, was there?

54:49.756 --> 54:53.225
No, but the radioactivity
could've extended there.

54:53.227 --> 54:55.192
Maybe that's why no one
wanted to land.

54:55.194 --> 54:57.129
We're still close enough.

54:57.131 --> 54:59.064
I'm tired of this mystery.

54:59.066 --> 55:03.337
I'm gonna find out what's going
on in the ground right now.

55:21.821 --> 55:23.323
My God.

55:57.089 --> 55:58.589
What is that?

55:58.591 --> 56:00.591
It's my cell.

56:00.593 --> 56:02.863
I put it back in my bag.

56:13.306 --> 56:15.039
<i>Hello?</i>

56:15.041 --> 56:16.875
Lisa, sweetheart!

56:16.877 --> 56:18.276
Dad!

56:18.278 --> 56:20.010
Oh, thank God
that you're alive.

56:20.012 --> 56:21.044
I've been trying to reach you
for hours.

56:21.046 --> 56:22.912
Where are you?

56:22.914 --> 56:26.151
I'm onboard an airplane
with some friends.

56:26.153 --> 56:28.587
I... We were on our way to L.A.

56:28.589 --> 56:30.487
Dad, you have to tell us.

56:30.489 --> 56:32.257
<i>There's been nuclear attacks,
right?</i>

56:32.259 --> 56:35.530
I mean, we've got almost
no information up here.

56:37.230 --> 56:39.095
Yes, Lisa, there have.

56:39.097 --> 56:41.399
The Continental United States
was hit

56:41.401 --> 56:44.268
by 11 nuclear missiles
in the course of the night.

56:44.270 --> 56:48.339
<i>Millions of people were killed
in the explosions alone.</i>

56:48.341 --> 56:50.106
At the moment,
everybody is trying

56:50.108 --> 56:52.210
to escape from the radioactive
contamination.

56:52.212 --> 56:55.945
<i>I'll probably drive further
north in the morning myself.</i>

56:55.947 --> 56:57.914
Dad... who...

56:57.916 --> 57:00.287
who did this?

57:03.323 --> 57:06.055
What they say is that
unknown rebel forces

57:06.057 --> 57:08.526
have taken over a military
base in the Russian outback

57:08.528 --> 57:10.562
from which the missiles
were launched.

57:10.564 --> 57:12.997
The execution of that attack

57:12.999 --> 57:15.999
must've been
highly professional.

57:16.001 --> 57:18.636
<i>About an hour ago,
the Russian Government</i>

57:18.638 --> 57:21.339
<i>claimed they've regained
control of the facility.</i>

57:21.341 --> 57:24.008
So... the attack is over?

57:25.144 --> 57:27.043
Lisa. Lisa.

57:27.045 --> 57:28.612
<i>Are you still there?</i>

57:28.614 --> 57:31.081
Oh no, my battery's low.

57:31.083 --> 57:32.651
Dad, Dad can you hear me?

57:32.653 --> 57:34.084
Lisa, listen to me.

57:34.086 --> 57:35.184
- <i>Dad...</i>
- Listen to me.

57:35.186 --> 57:37.121
<i>You must stay in the air</i>

57:37.123 --> 57:38.923
<i>to avoid the radiation.</i>

57:38.925 --> 57:41.025
<i>All airplanes are advised
not to land</i>

57:41.027 --> 57:43.428
but to fly out of
the contaminated area.

57:43.430 --> 57:46.329
<i>Since the bombs
exploded on the ground,</i>

57:46.331 --> 57:48.500
even a few minutes
of ground exposure

57:48.502 --> 57:50.602
is already said to be lethal.

57:50.604 --> 57:54.137
Get away from the mainland,
as far as possible.

57:54.139 --> 57:56.106
<i>Stay skybound.</i>

57:56.108 --> 57:57.106
Dad?

57:57.108 --> 57:59.108
Stay skybound!

57:59.110 --> 58:00.544
Dad?

58:06.653 --> 58:08.220
I love you.

58:11.057 --> 58:12.959
Hey.

58:25.104 --> 58:28.238
<i>So... bearing in mind
what Lisa's dad said,</i>

58:28.240 --> 58:31.240
what course should we set
with our remaining fuel?

58:31.242 --> 58:33.110
How far do we have to
fly away from

58:33.112 --> 58:35.111
let's say our major
mainland cities

58:35.113 --> 58:36.748
not to be affected by
radiation?

58:36.750 --> 58:38.750
Great,
nobody here knows anything

58:38.752 --> 58:40.985
about radiation or its range.

58:40.987 --> 58:44.121
Without cells, radio, or at
least an internet connection,

58:44.123 --> 58:46.256
there's no way to find out
anything up here.

58:46.258 --> 58:47.591
And we can't...

58:47.593 --> 58:49.325
land... either!

58:51.530 --> 58:55.365
Hey, isn't that entertainment
and education package

58:55.367 --> 58:58.202
still on the hard disk
of the video system?

58:58.204 --> 59:00.070
What?

59:00.072 --> 59:01.974
You mean that kid's
encyclopedia?

59:06.045 --> 59:07.645
Come on.
Don't be damaged.

59:07.647 --> 59:10.347
Don't be damaged.

59:10.349 --> 59:13.217
- Yes!
- What is that?

59:13.219 --> 59:16.320
It's just a collection
of games and movies

59:16.322 --> 59:18.521
in case you get bored during
the flight... it's useless.

59:18.523 --> 59:20.289
Well, we just need
range information, right?

59:20.291 --> 59:22.059
At least just a vague idea.

59:22.061 --> 59:23.559
There's gotta be
some kind of entry

59:23.561 --> 59:24.795
on the bombings of
Hiroshima or Nagasaki.

59:24.797 --> 59:28.231
Ha. You can't be serious.

59:29.501 --> 59:32.237
It really is for children.

59:40.311 --> 59:42.146
All right.

59:42.148 --> 59:44.581
"Although the explosive
forces of today's bombs

59:44.583 --> 59:47.450
"are about seven times higher,

59:47.452 --> 59:49.619
"the bombings of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki

59:49.621 --> 59:52.424
during World War II
were devastating enough."

59:54.828 --> 59:57.593
"Radiation never reached
the U.S.,

59:57.595 --> 59:59.363
"as radiation range

59:59.365 --> 01:00:02.265
"exponentially
decreases over water.

01:00:02.267 --> 01:00:04.267
In this case,
the Pacific Ocean."

01:00:04.269 --> 01:00:06.538
Great,
feeling smarter now?

01:00:08.841 --> 01:00:11.777
You're right,
it's... useless.

01:00:16.115 --> 01:00:20.286
Well, this one seems to be
telling some sort of range.

01:00:26.224 --> 01:00:28.559
How do you know that?

01:00:28.561 --> 01:00:31.128
I was always good at math.

01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:33.630
Didn't wanna study it though.
Too boring.

01:00:33.632 --> 01:00:35.198
Honey, are you kidding me?

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.603
Did you think I was dumb,
or what?

01:00:39.704 --> 01:00:41.738
So if I give you
our fuel range,

01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:43.407
can you make something
out of it?

01:00:43.409 --> 01:00:44.744
Well, let's see.

01:00:46.144 --> 01:00:48.811
That one seems to stand
for explosive force,

01:00:48.813 --> 01:00:51.215
which we know is about
seven times higher now.

01:00:51.217 --> 01:00:52.648
Didn't you just so, Kyle?

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:55.487
Uh, yeah, I did.

01:00:56.655 --> 01:00:59.689
All right, tell me how much
fuel's left

01:00:59.691 --> 01:01:02.425
- and, uh, do we have a map?
- Yeah.

01:01:02.427 --> 01:01:06.662
Okay. Bring it to me
and... a shot of something?

01:01:06.664 --> 01:01:08.400
I need to wake up.

01:01:57.516 --> 01:01:58.548
No, go ahead,
tear it apart.

01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:00.319
Patience.

01:02:12.264 --> 01:02:15.264
Okay, so based upon
our remaining fuel,

01:02:15.266 --> 01:02:16.465
and assuming
that either Los Angeles

01:02:16.467 --> 01:02:18.401
or San Francisco were hit,

01:02:18.403 --> 01:02:21.572
we can't get far enough
anymore going north or south.

01:02:21.574 --> 01:02:23.439
And since the east is
where we're coming from,

01:02:23.441 --> 01:02:26.876
the only safe place we
still could reach lies west,

01:02:26.878 --> 01:02:30.613
about 300 miles before
the Hawaiian Islands.

01:02:30.615 --> 01:02:32.282
But that's in the water.

01:02:32.284 --> 01:02:33.784
How are supposed to land there,
Roxy?

01:02:33.786 --> 01:02:35.920
How should I know?

01:02:37.755 --> 01:02:39.922
Can I have another one
of these, please?

01:02:39.924 --> 01:02:42.492
I sure wanna be drunk
when I die.

01:02:44.796 --> 01:02:46.829
Is there really
nowhere else we can go?

01:02:46.831 --> 01:02:49.900
Nope,
contamination everywhere.

01:02:49.902 --> 01:02:52.203
Then we are dead.

01:02:55.239 --> 01:02:58.874
Only 300 miles away
from Hawaii?

01:02:58.876 --> 01:03:01.711
But can we make that somehow?

01:03:01.713 --> 01:03:04.013
- What if we lost weight?
- Oh, forget it.

01:03:04.015 --> 01:03:05.749
You would never ever
gain that much more range

01:03:05.751 --> 01:03:07.784
by doing that.

01:03:07.786 --> 01:03:09.785
Not by tossing out the
suitcases, you couldn't.

01:03:09.787 --> 01:03:13.523
But what if we ripped
out the entire interior?

01:03:13.525 --> 01:03:16.762
I mean the TVs,
the seats, everything.

01:03:19.931 --> 01:03:21.631
You cannot be serious.

01:03:21.633 --> 01:03:23.733
What if we take
everything apart,

01:03:23.735 --> 01:03:25.535
including the bathroom,
and throw it out?

01:03:25.537 --> 01:03:28.941
Then with a little luck,
maybe?

01:03:32.009 --> 01:03:35.411
Come on,
what have we got to lose?

01:03:44.722 --> 01:03:45.920
Ah!

01:04:21.391 --> 01:04:23.827
Okay, so the computer
should automatically

01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:25.427
detect our new weight
and calculating

01:04:25.429 --> 01:04:27.299
if we have enough fuel
to reach Hawaii.

01:04:30.067 --> 01:04:31.834
So here goes.

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:42.411
What?

01:04:42.413 --> 01:04:43.780
Just 80 more miles.

01:04:43.782 --> 01:04:45.852
Not even a third more.

01:04:48.018 --> 01:04:50.386
See, I told you.

01:04:50.388 --> 01:04:53.422
Oh, that's just great Kyle,
to have known that in advance.

01:04:53.424 --> 01:04:55.795
That's really great
and so fucking helpful.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.661
All right, you can
shut the fuck up.

01:04:58.663 --> 01:05:01.563
- Make me.
- Guys, take it easy, come on.

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:03.699
You're so smart little bro,
you're the smartest kid I know.

01:05:03.701 --> 01:05:05.134
You know what?
You can be real proud

01:05:05.136 --> 01:05:06.935
of yourself Matty,
you know why?

01:05:06.937 --> 01:05:08.571
'Cause now we can't even

01:05:08.573 --> 01:05:10.406
get the news broadcasts
anymore, can we?

01:05:10.408 --> 01:05:12.475
Stop it, both of you!
What's gotten into you?

01:05:12.477 --> 01:05:14.545
This isn't gonna help anyone.

01:05:15.747 --> 01:05:17.612
Damn it!

01:05:17.614 --> 01:05:18.913
I'm sorry.

01:05:41.471 --> 01:05:43.638
So what else can we do?

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.040
Maybe just fly north or south,

01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:47.576
as far as possible,
and then land?

01:05:47.578 --> 01:05:49.011
After all,
Roxy's calculations

01:05:49.013 --> 01:05:50.846
might be slightly off
to our advantage.

01:05:50.848 --> 01:05:52.914
Yeah,
but even if they are off,

01:05:52.917 --> 01:05:55.851
one thing's for sure...
the difference between

01:05:55.853 --> 01:05:57.819
how far we must travel
over ground

01:05:57.821 --> 01:05:59.955
or over water is extreme.

01:05:59.957 --> 01:06:01.824
We've all read
the radiation range

01:06:01.826 --> 01:06:04.025
dramatically
decreases over water.

01:06:04.027 --> 01:06:06.594
So if we go north or south,

01:06:06.596 --> 01:06:08.663
we might stay within
radiation range?

01:06:08.665 --> 01:06:11.801
No, we will for sure.

01:06:11.803 --> 01:06:13.471
Shit.

01:06:14.705 --> 01:06:16.705
Last year I was on
a passenger plane

01:06:16.707 --> 01:06:20.743
headed for Buenos Aires,
and one side's engine failed.

01:06:20.745 --> 01:06:22.545
But the pilot managed
to land the plane

01:06:22.547 --> 01:06:24.616
as if nothing had happened.

01:06:26.116 --> 01:06:29.118
Even during landing, you
wouldn't have noticed a thing.

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:30.689
All smooth.

01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:33.624
What are you saying?

01:06:37.828 --> 01:06:42.062
If we could remove
one of the engines,

01:06:42.064 --> 01:06:43.665
we'd probably lose
the necessary weight

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:45.868
to make it all the way
to Hawaii.

01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:47.035
What?

01:06:47.037 --> 01:06:50.538
Remove one of the engines?

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:52.544
How the hell are we
supposed to do that?

01:06:58.882 --> 01:07:00.748
This here is steel.

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:03.455
That out there is only
aluminum.

01:07:04.254 --> 01:07:05.954
You wanna walk out
onto a wing

01:07:05.956 --> 01:07:08.088
and cut off one of
the engines?

01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:09.757
Are you insane?

01:07:09.759 --> 01:07:11.726
Matt, that's suicide.

01:07:11.728 --> 01:07:14.198
He's only messing with
you anyway.

01:07:16.999 --> 01:07:18.836
I say let's try it.

01:07:19.936 --> 01:07:22.070
What?

01:07:22.072 --> 01:07:24.204
We have to at least try,
right?

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:26.708
I mean,
even I heard of failed engines

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:28.844
on passenger planes
that still landed safely.

01:07:28.846 --> 01:07:32.748
Odin, even if we reduce our
speed as much as possible,

01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:36.518
we'd still have to stay
above 160 miles an hour,

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.986
otherwise the plane just
drops out of the air.

01:07:38.988 --> 01:07:40.556
So you ever stick your hand out

01:07:40.558 --> 01:07:41.955
of your car going that speed?

01:07:41.957 --> 01:07:43.558
Then you might know
the feeling.

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:46.059
But look,
the engine's mounting

01:07:46.061 --> 01:07:47.663
is right above the wing.

01:07:47.665 --> 01:07:49.565
Just like two yards away,

01:07:49.567 --> 01:07:51.699
and we still got those belts
to hold Matt from the inside.

01:07:51.701 --> 01:07:53.166
We even have the
parachute's belts.

01:07:53.168 --> 01:07:55.538
All right, count me
out of this one.

01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:58.841
But I can't bro, we need
someone to level the plane

01:07:58.843 --> 01:08:02.178
when the engine comes off,
to restore the balance.

01:08:04.146 --> 01:08:05.748
Whatever.

01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:08.052
I know you still
love her, Kyle.

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:12.986
But I love her too.

01:08:12.988 --> 01:08:15.023
I guess that's just too bad,
isn't it?

01:08:15.025 --> 01:08:16.990
Matt, please.

01:08:16.992 --> 01:08:18.660
But either way,
little brother,

01:08:18.662 --> 01:08:23.598
she'll die and we'll die
if you and I

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.899
don't stop fighting
and start working together.

01:08:26.902 --> 01:08:30.203
I know you're smart, Kyle.

01:08:30.205 --> 01:08:34.676
Way smarter than me.
It was always like that.

01:08:34.679 --> 01:08:39.747
But sometimes...
you have to take a chance.

01:08:39.750 --> 01:08:42.888
You must take a risk.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.823
Try the impossible.

01:08:46.356 --> 01:08:49.792
You know,
if we don't act now,

01:08:49.794 --> 01:08:52.263
we're dead already.

01:08:53.062 --> 01:08:57.633
This plane...
it's gonna be our tomb.

01:08:57.635 --> 01:09:02.234
Either we'll crash because
we run out of fuel

01:09:02.237 --> 01:09:05.274
or we're gonna land and die
from radiation eventually.

01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:09.810
Or...

01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:11.582
we can fight.

01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:16.149
Fight our way back
into the light.

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:18.255
We can climb out of this tomb!

01:09:19.790 --> 01:09:21.055
Even if we're...

01:09:21.057 --> 01:09:24.225
we're scared and desperate,

01:09:24.227 --> 01:09:26.296
and the only way to do it
sounds insane.

01:09:28.765 --> 01:09:32.935
We can't let out egos get
in the way anymore, Kyle.

01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:36.270
You and I...

01:09:36.272 --> 01:09:39.743
need to work together...
as brothers.

01:09:41.143 --> 01:09:43.042
Or we will die

01:09:43.045 --> 01:09:44.912
as individuals.

01:10:16.446 --> 01:10:17.979
You really think
it was such a good idea

01:10:17.981 --> 01:10:19.413
to take the canvas off?

01:10:19.415 --> 01:10:22.016
What would be the point
in landing?

01:10:22.018 --> 01:10:24.084
Yeah, right.

01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:33.093
Well, it's been quite a
first date, hasn't it Lisa?

01:10:33.095 --> 01:10:36.064
It has.

01:10:36.066 --> 01:10:37.865
But you know...

01:10:37.867 --> 01:10:40.333
it's not over yet.

01:10:40.335 --> 01:10:43.971
You promised to take me home,
remember?

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:47.708
Yeah, I promise.

01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:55.119
I'll wait for you to do that.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:07.830
Okay, speed down to 160.

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:10.700
Let's do this shit.

01:11:39.928 --> 01:11:41.495
Jesus!

01:11:55.077 --> 01:11:56.213
Matt!

01:12:06.455 --> 01:12:08.823
Look,
he made it, he's hitting it!

01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:10.260
Yeah baby, whoo!

01:12:16.532 --> 01:12:18.399
There! For a moment
it was disconnected

01:12:18.401 --> 01:12:19.902
from the electricity.

01:12:23.905 --> 01:12:25.476
Come on Matt, hold on!

01:12:38.287 --> 01:12:39.486
Oh, God!

01:12:42.156 --> 01:12:46.260
Hurry up guys... it has to
come off now or we'll crash.

01:12:46.262 --> 01:12:47.861
I can't reach the end.

01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:48.994
Fuck!

01:12:53.067 --> 01:12:55.001
I can't hold it any longer.

01:13:18.293 --> 01:13:19.328
No!

01:13:33.576 --> 01:13:35.274
Ah...

01:13:35.276 --> 01:13:36.543
It worked!

01:13:36.545 --> 01:13:38.144
The plane's back in balance!

01:13:40.281 --> 01:13:41.915
We made it!

01:13:48.558 --> 01:13:50.189
Where's Matt?

01:14:50.084 --> 01:14:51.119
Here.

01:14:52.587 --> 01:14:53.955
Thanks, Lisa.

01:14:57.092 --> 01:15:00.292
Still minus 26 miles till
we reach our destination.

01:15:00.294 --> 01:15:03.363
What... does that mean
we're not gonna make it?

01:15:03.365 --> 01:15:05.431
No, I think we will.

01:15:05.433 --> 01:15:07.667
The computer uses
an average wind speed

01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:11.537
for its calculations
and there's a buffer, so...

01:15:11.539 --> 01:15:14.674
With a bit of luck...

01:15:14.676 --> 01:15:17.213
everything will be just fine.

01:15:21.016 --> 01:15:23.386
I'm so sorry for you, Kyle.

01:15:24.419 --> 01:15:26.088
About Matt.

01:15:28.723 --> 01:15:31.424
He was right.

01:15:31.426 --> 01:15:35.729
Sometimes
you have to take a chance.

01:15:37.766 --> 01:15:40.335
He was so...

01:15:42.303 --> 01:15:44.436
Brave.

01:15:50.145 --> 01:15:54.316
You're gonna have to live
for the both of you now.

01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:17.237
The engine just shut off.
We're out of fuel.

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:20.073
What?
How far away are we?

01:16:20.075 --> 01:16:22.011
Only a few miles.

01:16:28.182 --> 01:16:29.351
We're gonna hit the water!

01:16:40.661 --> 01:16:42.498
<i>Caution. The rain.</i>

01:16:43.731 --> 01:16:46.502
I'll try and keep
the nose up.

01:17:55.503 --> 01:17:57.369
<i>Although millions
were killed</i>

01:17:57.371 --> 01:17:59.538
<i>in yesterday's
disastrous attacks,</i>

01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:03.175
<i>people still keep getting out
of the contaminated areas,</i>

01:18:03.177 --> 01:18:06.210
<i>reaching Mexico,
Canada, or even Hawaii.</i>

01:18:06.212 --> 01:18:09.515
<i>And as the world stands
ready to help civilians</i>

01:18:09.517 --> 01:18:11.215
<i>of the catastrophe,</i>

01:18:11.217 --> 01:18:13.819
<i>a new beginning
will certainly come.</i>
