Hey, Billy.

00:23.008 --> 00:24.041
You seen Kris Kedder?

00:24.545 --> 00:25.602
Check his trailer.

00:49.221 --> 00:51.288
Hey, man,
what's going on?

00:55.274 --> 00:56.333
Where'd you get that?

00:56.400 --> 00:57.467
Disc jockey I know.

00:57.500 --> 00:58.759
They sent him
an advance copy.

00:58.806 --> 00:59.896
Do you like that cover?

01:00.134 --> 01:01.156
That was my idea.

01:01.277 --> 01:02.780
Stealing my credit,
stealing my song,

01:02.827 --> 01:03.809
was that your idea too?

01:03.856 --> 01:05.271
What, your name's
not on there?

01:05.318 --> 01:06.498
Y'know, don't give me that.

01:06.614 --> 01:09.455
<i>Peggy's Gone to Memphis,
words and music by Kris Kedder.</i>

01:09.819 --> 01:11.934
You know, you told me
if I kept my mouth shut,

01:12.195 --> 01:14.344
if I was a "good boy"
that you'd take care of me.

01:15.024 --> 01:16.814
I guess you figure
I'm just some dumb roadie

01:16.832 --> 01:18.652
that you can rip off
and nobody's gonna care.

01:18.676 --> 01:20.900
Okay, Stork, my man,
let's just relax.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.001
Now I was gonna talk to you
about this.

01:24.692 --> 01:26.081
I'm gonna offer you five grand.

01:27.009 --> 01:28.034
Five grand?

01:28.277 --> 01:29.333
For a hit song?

01:29.397 --> 01:30.607
Look, dude, you got talent.

01:30.811 --> 01:32.866
You co-wrote a great song,
but you don't understand

01:32.877 --> 01:33.834
how the business works.

01:33.867 --> 01:35.333
I didn't co-write anything.

01:35.367 --> 01:37.789
I wrote that song,
every note, every line.

01:37.918 --> 01:39.710
I let you take half-credit
because you said

01:39.733 --> 01:41.046
it would jumpstart my career.

01:41.107 --> 01:42.093
All right, all right.

01:42.140 --> 01:44.834
Look, let's just
keep your voice down, c'mere.

01:44.867 --> 01:46.467
What, you don't
want anybody to see us?

01:46.500 --> 01:47.973
No, just, whoa, come here.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.694
Yeah, hey, you know what,
I don't blame you.

01:50.729 --> 01:52.437
The rock and roll legend
hasn't written

01:52.472 --> 01:54.034
a half-decent song
in ten years.

01:54.067 --> 01:55.933
Well, I got some bad news
for you, rock star.

01:56.003 --> 01:57.490
I can prove
I wrote that song.

01:57.643 --> 01:59.184
I made copies
of the sheet music,

01:59.243 --> 02:01.309
sent it to myself,
registered mail.

02:01.814 --> 02:02.867
That's not legal.

02:02.949 --> 02:04.479
You want to bet your career on that?

02:06.064 --> 02:06.980
What are you doing?

02:07.015 --> 02:08.368
I'm calling a copyright lawyer.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.648
I'm taking my song back.

02:09.691 --> 02:11.804
All right, you win, you--
I'll give you half credit.

02:11.839 --> 02:13.659
Mr. Jackson, all right,
listen, my name--

03:30.530 --> 03:32.092
- Captain!
- Oh, Captain,

03:32.773 --> 03:34.825
for the record,
this was all her idea.

03:34.984 --> 03:37.132
All right, I-I wouldn't even
be here if I could drive

03:37.156 --> 03:38.248
or had anything else to do.

03:38.386 --> 03:39.571
Okay, I give up, what is it?

03:39.607 --> 03:41.955
It's a $34 dry cleaning bill
to clean the shirt and jacket

03:41.990 --> 03:44.234
that Mr. Monk ruined when
he ran through the poultry farm

03:44.257 --> 03:45.349
to recover the ransom money

03:45.384 --> 03:46.876
in the Jimmy Creskow
kidnapping case.

03:46.899 --> 03:49.131
- What are you going to do about it?
- Try to ignore it.

03:49.155 --> 03:50.758
No, we've already
submitted this twice.

03:50.780 --> 03:52.770
It is a work-related expense,
and we are entitled

03:52.804 --> 03:54.423
- to compensation.
- Not my idea.

03:54.496 --> 03:56.034
Look, I couldn't agree
with you more.

03:56.057 --> 03:58.282
I think you guys are entitled
to every dime you can get.

03:58.329 --> 03:59.972
But there's nothing
I can do about it.

04:00.016 --> 04:02.104
Lieutenant Disher is
the disbursement coordinator.

04:02.326 --> 04:03.338
Okay, where is he?

04:03.535 --> 04:04.911
He's not here,
he called in sick.

04:04.970 --> 04:05.971
Is he okay?

04:06.004 --> 04:07.459
You know, he didn't sound
too good,

04:07.495 --> 04:09.037
he's got a fever
and he's got a cough.

04:09.071 --> 04:10.193
That phlegmy fluid thing?

04:10.228 --> 04:11.624
Okay, when Randy is not here,

04:11.659 --> 04:12.833
who is in charge
of payout?

04:12.857 --> 04:15.113
That would be the assistant
disbursement coordinator.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.815
- And who is that?
- We don't have one.

04:16.875 --> 04:18.952
- Anything else?
- Nah, that covers it.

04:21.954 --> 04:23.081
Hello, Karen.

04:24.210 --> 04:25.271
He what?

04:25.338 --> 04:26.383
When?

04:28.254 --> 04:29.271
When?

04:30.087 --> 04:32.670
<i>Wha--I thought Jared
was grounded.</i>

04:33.553 --> 04:35.621
<i>Well, how did he get there?</i>

04:36.004 --> 04:38.704
Okay, I'll take care of it.

04:39.554 --> 04:41.220
Yeah, no, I'll call you.

04:44.187 --> 04:46.569
My kid, my oldest,
has skipped school,

04:46.653 --> 04:48.636
and Karen thinks
he's gone to a rock show.

04:48.669 --> 04:50.603
Oh, I used to do that.

04:51.020 --> 04:53.003
Play hooky,
go to rock shows.

04:53.053 --> 04:54.420
- You did?
- All the time.

04:55.061 --> 04:57.328
Anyhow, I gotta get up there,
see if I can't find him.

04:57.420 --> 04:59.437
- Okay.
- You need some help?

05:00.037 --> 05:01.820
Yeah, you know, I wouldn't mind.
Thank you.

05:01.870 --> 05:03.187
- I'll come with you.
- Good.

05:03.287 --> 05:05.070
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.204
I'm sorry, I just can't picture
you at one of these.

05:07.238 --> 05:09.104
Talking about, I used to go
all the time.

05:09.137 --> 05:11.403
Get a bus into the city,
see the Stones.

05:13.020 --> 05:14.487
Look at this mess.

05:16.094 --> 05:18.466
Well, for God's sake,
it's gonna take me all day

05:18.501 --> 05:19.664
to find him here.

05:21.056 --> 05:23.052
I'm gonna miss
a whole day's work.

05:23.388 --> 05:24.726
An entire day!

05:25.848 --> 05:27.140
Gonna wring his little neck.

05:27.704 --> 05:29.571
Hey, Captain, he's just a kid,
don't you want

05:29.618 --> 05:31.954
to just stay out here
and calm down before you go inside?

05:31.989 --> 05:32.987
No!

05:34.811 --> 05:36.081
Ah, wait, wa--wait,

05:36.715 --> 05:39.310
What--what kind of rock show
is this?

05:39.370 --> 05:41.082
<i>It's the biggest festival
of the year.</i>

05:41.246 --> 05:42.432
Festival?

05:44.238 --> 05:46.203
Oh, wait,
poor you, Mr. Monk.

05:46.845 --> 05:48.403
You thought
they were real rocks?

05:48.676 --> 05:50.033
Like a geology exhibit?

05:50.080 --> 05:51.175
<i>Like in a museum?</i>

05:51.872 --> 05:52.870
Maybe.

05:53.243 --> 05:55.040
Perfectly
understandable mistake.

05:55.529 --> 05:56.562
No, not really.

05:56.937 --> 05:58.453
<i>Okay, well,
no harm done.</i>

05:58.523 --> 06:00.171
So I guess I'll need a ride home.

06:00.502 --> 06:03.215
Monk, I'm not going home
without my kid.

06:03.979 --> 06:05.338
All right, look, I-I can't.

06:06.223 --> 06:08.297
I can't do it.
I-I can't go in there.

06:08.344 --> 06:10.276
Okay, Mr. Monk, come on,
the captain needs you.

06:10.311 --> 06:14.346
But there's 10,000 of them,
and not even one of me.

06:14.428 --> 06:16.139
Okay, look,
I understand Monk.

06:16.162 --> 06:17.965
Why don't you just go wait
by the car?

06:18.036 --> 06:19.437
Yeah, I'll go wait
by the car.

06:19.470 --> 06:20.971
Okay, it's gonna be awhile.

06:21.256 --> 06:23.417
Yeah, I'll be okay,
don't worry about me.

06:23.546 --> 06:26.775
Take your time,
but--but hurry back.

06:27.409 --> 06:28.704
But take your time.

06:29.290 --> 06:30.934
And hurry back...

06:31.796 --> 06:34.668
Bracelet, let me see it.

06:36.123 --> 06:38.378
All right, people, bracelets.
Let me see 'em.

06:38.938 --> 06:40.338
Bracelets, people.

06:40.617 --> 06:42.238
Keep your arms up,
see your bracelets.

06:42.271 --> 06:44.242
I don't have a bracelet,
all I have is this.

06:44.686 --> 06:46.619
How can I help you?
I'm looking for my son.

06:47.503 --> 06:49.719
- He's 15, uh...
- 15.

06:49.837 --> 06:51.204
Wearing a gray T-shirt.

06:51.508 --> 06:53.070
Uh, he's about 5'6".

06:53.216 --> 06:55.657
- 5'6", 15.
- Isn't he 16?

06:56.304 --> 06:57.939
Yeah, right, he's 16.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.723
- Okay, 16.
- Brown hair.

06:59.904 --> 07:02.015
- Brown hair.
- Wearing an earring.

07:02.071 --> 07:03.686
Which ear?

07:06.475 --> 07:08.091
- Left ear.
- Left ear.

07:08.204 --> 07:09.470
Left ear earring.

07:09.809 --> 07:12.827
Hey, listen, you got a picture?
We can make copies and pass it out.

07:12.940 --> 07:14.133
Yeah, good idea.

07:14.227 --> 07:15.447
Yeah.

07:17.014 --> 07:19.005
See if I can
help you out here.

07:20.254 --> 07:21.682
That's his mom.

07:22.605 --> 07:23.936
That's Jared.

07:24.379 --> 07:25.670
Jared Stottlemeyer.

07:25.745 --> 07:27.514
But he's 16,
this kid?

07:28.971 --> 07:30.804
No, that's--
that's an old picture.

07:31.144 --> 07:32.947
You don't have anything
more recent?

07:34.617 --> 07:36.737
Uh...no, I guess not.

07:36.770 --> 07:38.470
<i>All right, look,
I'm gonna do what I can.</i>

07:38.503 --> 07:40.171
Meanwhile,
you guys take these.

07:40.249 --> 07:42.408
You'll have full access,
backstage, wherever you want.

07:42.465 --> 07:45.771
If you still can't find him, we'll make
an announcement from the stage.

07:45.937 --> 07:47.804
- Appreciate it.
- Okay, good luck.

07:47.837 --> 07:49.238
Bracelets, people,
let me see 'em!

07:50.094 --> 07:51.596
What?

07:53.239 --> 07:55.604
You think I don't spend
enough time with Jared.

07:56.772 --> 07:59.204
Why, because I haven't got
a bunch of pictures of him?

07:59.923 --> 08:01.388
Doesn't mean anything.

08:02.238 --> 08:04.821
How many pictures of Julie
do you walk around with?

08:07.570 --> 08:09.188
Ah, I get it.

08:10.289 --> 08:12.348
You think I'm avoiding
the boys on purpose

08:12.386 --> 08:14.570
because I feel guilty
about the separation.

08:14.858 --> 08:16.370
And the fact
that I'm dating Linda.

08:16.588 --> 08:17.940
Is that it?

08:20.036 --> 08:21.651
Don't you ever shut up?

08:23.338 --> 08:25.904
Okay, look, you go that way,
keep your cell phone on.

08:25.937 --> 08:27.399
Give me a call
if you find him.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.118
Excuse me.

08:42.780 --> 08:43.924
Excuse me!

08:44.505 --> 08:46.289
There's no dancing here!

08:47.264 --> 08:49.392
Uh, this is a parking area.

08:49.505 --> 08:52.540
This is for vehicles,
and people waiting

08:52.709 --> 08:54.097
for the captain.

08:55.537 --> 08:57.570
I'm sorry,
I don't make the rules.

08:58.231 --> 09:00.015
That's right,
you don't.

09:02.927 --> 09:04.071
What are you doing?

09:04.104 --> 09:05.171
Oh, hey, hey!

09:05.204 --> 09:07.037
This is
the police captain's car!

09:10.381 --> 09:13.217
How old are you?
There's no way you're 25.

09:13.892 --> 09:15.188
Excuse me.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.997
Attention, may I have
your attention, please?

09:30.611 --> 09:33.675
Excuse me,
is there a taxi stand?

09:33.748 --> 09:36.114
- I-I need a cab.
- Not around here, buddy.

09:36.927 --> 09:38.271
Is there a pay phone?

09:38.304 --> 09:39.762
Yeah, down on the right.

09:40.195 --> 09:41.453
Down here.

09:42.137 --> 09:43.218
Excuse me.

09:43.289 --> 09:44.509
Sorry.

09:46.370 --> 09:47.338
Sorry.

09:48.804 --> 09:49.885
Pay phone?

09:50.640 --> 09:51.860
This way?

09:52.004 --> 09:53.271
That way? This way?

09:55.204 --> 09:56.278
That way.

09:57.911 --> 10:01.591
Sorry, am I heading
toward the pay phone?

10:03.584 --> 10:05.743
Over here! Over here!

10:06.037 --> 10:07.405
It...

10:08.359 --> 10:10.503
Try to minimize
the roughhousing!

10:10.782 --> 10:11.928
Can we?

10:15.550 --> 10:16.871
Uh, phone?

10:17.058 --> 10:18.354
I have--sir?

10:21.511 --> 10:23.483
Phone.
Working phone.

10:24.338 --> 10:25.403
All right!

10:26.041 --> 10:27.304
Who threw that?

10:27.338 --> 10:28.527
Who threw--

10:28.708 --> 10:30.301
Excuse--give me that.

10:31.709 --> 10:32.817
Who?

10:32.962 --> 10:34.164
Who was it?

10:34.877 --> 10:36.518
You have to watch
what you're doing!

10:39.168 --> 10:41.737
I've seen people's eyes
poked out with these things.

10:42.573 --> 10:44.635
Not...not poked out,

10:44.729 --> 10:47.158
but cornea was scratched!

10:47.776 --> 10:52.197
Or bruised, or...
there was some discoloration!

11:43.486 --> 11:45.338
Mr. Monk!
What are you doing?

11:46.002 --> 11:47.579
I was just calling
for a taxi.

11:47.635 --> 11:49.945
They're gonna pick me up
out front in about ten minutes.

11:49.982 --> 11:53.544
But, Mr. Monk, that wasn't
a phone booth.

11:54.471 --> 11:55.899
No, that wasn't
a phone booth...

11:57.152 --> 12:01.171
Natalie, that was some kind
of horrible plastic outhouse!

12:02.529 --> 12:03.750
Oh, my God.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.175
What was I talking into?

12:07.402 --> 12:12.059
My God, where's--
where did I put that quarter?

12:12.650 --> 12:15.503
For the love of God, Natalie,
where did I put that quarter?

12:15.852 --> 12:16.937
Oh, my God!

12:43.304 --> 12:45.337
Oh, how long do you think
I was in there?

12:45.370 --> 12:47.337
I don't know, Mr. Monk,
maybe a minute.

12:47.589 --> 12:48.603
That was rough.

12:48.653 --> 12:51.704
It was like some kind of medieval
torture device, that thing.

12:51.737 --> 12:52.758
Yeah, I know.

12:52.833 --> 12:54.701
I actually read,
for the Spanish Inquisition,

12:54.738 --> 12:56.466
they used to lock people
in Port-A-Johns.

12:56.635 --> 12:57.737
That wouldn't surprise me.

12:59.070 --> 13:01.270
All right, I-I it's--
it's time to go.

13:01.304 --> 13:03.704
No, no, Mr. Monk, we
haven't found the captain's son.

13:03.737 --> 13:04.871
Excuse me!

13:04.904 --> 13:06.103
Excuse me, hi.

13:06.137 --> 13:07.804
I heard some cops talking
back there.

13:07.837 --> 13:09.470
They said you're
some kind of detective.

13:09.526 --> 13:11.671
That's true, I am
some kind of detective.

13:11.974 --> 13:14.704
Hi, uh, Kendra Frank,
I'm a roadie with Trafalgar.

13:15.030 --> 13:16.213
Now, here.

13:16.872 --> 13:18.400
I was a friend
of Stork's.

13:18.644 --> 13:19.807
Here.

13:20.155 --> 13:23.085
I was more than his friend, I was
his sponsor at Narcotics Anonymous.

13:23.516 --> 13:25.270
- And, Stork is...
- The roadie?

13:25.821 --> 13:27.070
The roadie they just found?

13:27.837 --> 13:29.304
God, I'm so sorry.

13:29.337 --> 13:30.370
Stork.

13:30.404 --> 13:31.863
His real name
was Greg Murray.

13:31.916 --> 13:33.831
Look, they're trying to say
that he OD'd, okay?

13:33.888 --> 13:34.837
That's impossible.

13:34.871 --> 13:36.135
He's been clean
for 17 months.

13:36.191 --> 13:37.919
I know, I talk to him
about it every day.

13:37.975 --> 13:40.237
Well, Kendra, we were there,
we saw a needle in his arm.

13:40.270 --> 13:42.181
No, that's how I know
there's something wrong.

13:42.237 --> 13:44.038
Stork was completely phobic
about needles.

13:44.070 --> 13:45.574
He was the only roadie
I've ever met

13:45.612 --> 13:46.964
that didn't even have
one tattoo.

13:47.001 --> 13:48.823
I mean, he missed
a whole South American tour

13:48.861 --> 13:50.832
last year because
he wouldn't get vaccinated.

13:50.870 --> 13:51.903
Maybe he got over it.

13:51.940 --> 13:54.368
You don't just get over
a phobia like that overnight.

13:54.537 --> 13:55.496
Do you?

13:55.627 --> 13:57.618
No, you don't.

13:57.771 --> 13:58.991
So, please.

13:59.462 --> 14:00.721
What--what is this?

14:01.004 --> 14:03.315
Well, they gave me
his stuff, so, um...

14:03.871 --> 14:05.317
It's his tour jacket.

14:14.414 --> 14:15.737
This is a map.

14:16.064 --> 14:19.151
Yeah, I have one of those.
They--they gave it out at the door.

14:20.733 --> 14:22.452
You say he was afraid
of needles.

14:22.508 --> 14:23.536
Yeah, that's right.

14:23.592 --> 14:26.691
He had an acupuncture
appointment at 7:30 this morning.

14:26.766 --> 14:27.780
What?

15:03.452 --> 15:04.637
Hello?

15:04.833 --> 15:06.674
Hey, Randy,
how you doing, buddy,

15:06.749 --> 15:07.957
I'm--I was worried
about you.

15:08.896 --> 15:09.945
Captain?

15:10.039 --> 15:11.045
Yeah.

15:11.444 --> 15:12.665
What time is it?

15:13.528 --> 15:15.462
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I wake you up?

15:16.671 --> 15:18.162
Hey, what's that music
I hear?

15:18.425 --> 15:20.437
Oh, it's just my stereo.

15:20.895 --> 15:22.798
It's broken,
I can't turn it down.

15:24.201 --> 15:26.504
Listen, Captain,
thanks for calling.

15:26.537 --> 15:29.293
- Sure.
- I'm gonna-- I'm gonna get up now.

15:29.350 --> 15:31.266
I think I should make
myself some soup.

15:31.810 --> 15:34.064
Oh, soup, that's good.
Yeah, fluids are good.

15:34.158 --> 15:35.170
Drink plenty of fluids.

15:35.428 --> 15:37.535
Fluids, okay, I will.

15:37.591 --> 15:39.775
- Thanks for calling, Captain.
- Take care, all right.

15:40.741 --> 15:41.849
My boss.

15:46.694 --> 15:47.821
Captain.

15:49.702 --> 15:50.837
Lieutenant.

15:51.039 --> 15:54.270
Did you, uh,
did you call in sick too?

15:57.256 --> 15:58.904
No, Randy, I'm looking
for Jared.

16:00.603 --> 16:02.137
Well, here's what happened
with me.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.170
I was on my way
to the doctor,

16:04.203 --> 16:06.274
and the--I was--
and the--the...

16:07.924 --> 16:09.070
I got nothing.

16:10.383 --> 16:11.704
Let's go find Jared.

16:17.663 --> 16:19.270
Black bandanna and sunglasses.

16:19.304 --> 16:21.437
Yeah, it was this morning,
about 7:30.

16:21.470 --> 16:22.470
I remember.

16:22.504 --> 16:23.848
He was my first patient.

16:24.542 --> 16:26.186
Oh, was that the boy
who died?

16:26.506 --> 16:27.637
The overdose?

16:27.872 --> 16:29.070
Heartbreaking.

16:29.285 --> 16:30.525
How does that feel?

16:30.619 --> 16:32.038
Horrible.

16:37.042 --> 16:38.512
Are you sure that's him?

16:39.620 --> 16:42.424
He was a friend of yours...
I'm sorry.

16:42.518 --> 16:43.837
Did he say anything?

16:44.108 --> 16:45.304
No, not much.

16:45.337 --> 16:48.437
He just told me a story
about how he met Eric Clapton.

16:48.843 --> 16:50.137
He loved Eric Clapton.

16:55.586 --> 16:56.970
And he dropped this.

16:57.416 --> 16:59.500
Oh, my God,
I made this for him.

17:03.101 --> 17:04.660
Did he say anything else?

17:05.589 --> 17:07.112
Please, Annie,
I have to know.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.806
He asked me where
he could score some H.

17:10.031 --> 17:11.038
Heroin.

17:11.314 --> 17:13.003
H, heroin starts
with an H.

17:13.282 --> 17:14.769
- It's a street talk--
- Got that.

17:14.825 --> 17:15.938
He said he was giving up.

17:16.227 --> 17:17.404
He wanted to get high.

17:17.691 --> 17:19.503
He said he used to
be afraid of needles,

17:19.906 --> 17:20.902
but he got over it.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.038
I don't believe this.

17:22.147 --> 17:25.342
Well, I guess he's
with Kurt, Jimmy, and Janis now.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.337
- Who?
- I'll tell you later.

17:27.369 --> 17:29.070
Well, then he paid me and left.

17:29.914 --> 17:31.908
Did he talk
to anyone else?

17:32.152 --> 17:33.159
No.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.898
Oh, no, but when he left,
he stopped to help some kids,

17:35.935 --> 17:37.968
some girl,
she had a beach ball.

17:38.193 --> 17:40.404
She was having trouble,
so he blew it up for her.

17:40.992 --> 17:42.308
A blue beach ball?

17:42.440 --> 17:43.637
I think so.

17:43.969 --> 17:45.208
He blew that up?

17:45.643 --> 17:46.837
Thing almost killed me.

17:47.129 --> 17:48.406
I hate that beach ball.

17:48.838 --> 17:50.096
So it's true.

17:50.749 --> 17:52.137
They were right,
he OD'd.

17:52.483 --> 17:53.610
I'm so sorry.

17:54.246 --> 17:55.899
Thank you,
for trying.

18:02.835 --> 18:04.370
Mr. Monk, no!
No, n-no, no!

18:04.404 --> 18:05.820
That's 400 watts.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.553
No, no.
No.

18:39.572 --> 18:40.774
Dad?

18:42.890 --> 18:44.129
You needed backup, huh?

18:47.714 --> 18:50.351
This should help, just rub
this in twice a day.

18:51.215 --> 18:52.886
Did he really touch
a heat lamp?

18:54.546 --> 18:55.597
Why?

18:55.996 --> 18:57.137
I don't know.

18:57.399 --> 18:58.674
What about the other hand?

18:58.806 --> 18:59.969
He kept touching it.

19:01.309 --> 19:02.493
I don't know.

19:08.820 --> 19:10.323
They found him
in a Port-A-John.

19:10.846 --> 19:11.971
Can you believe it?

19:12.164 --> 19:13.941
I know, we were there
when it happened.

19:14.072 --> 19:15.333
He was so young.

19:15.910 --> 19:17.036
Overdose.

19:17.620 --> 19:19.441
The medical examiner
should be here soon.

19:19.478 --> 19:20.938
If you could just
step back.

19:20.971 --> 19:23.404
No, no, no, no, it's--it's okay,
I'm a police officer.

19:23.437 --> 19:24.604
At least, I used to be.

19:25.657 --> 19:26.771
There's no mud.

19:27.307 --> 19:28.358
Excuse me?

19:28.946 --> 19:30.121
On his boots.

19:30.496 --> 19:31.502
<i>There's no mud.</i>

19:31.577 --> 19:33.830
<i>There was mud
all around those outhouses.</i>

19:34.187 --> 19:35.685
Yeah, but they
carried him out.

19:35.986 --> 19:38.058
Okay, but who
carried him in?

19:49.256 --> 19:50.665
<i>No track marks.</i>

19:51.824 --> 19:53.082
Are these his?

19:54.712 --> 19:58.938
This--this rubber strap
was around his arm?

19:59.212 --> 20:00.977
That's right,
I took it off myself.

20:01.333 --> 20:02.778
You work
with drug addicts a lot?

20:03.266 --> 20:04.619
It goes with the territory.

20:05.013 --> 20:06.271
Natalie.

20:08.477 --> 20:10.205
They wrap it around,
like this,

20:11.662 --> 20:13.469
then they tie it
in a knot.

20:13.939 --> 20:15.967
Yeah, like...
like this.

20:16.470 --> 20:18.418
And then they pull it tight
with their teeth?

20:18.530 --> 20:20.437
- That's right.
- I'm not doing that.

20:20.470 --> 20:23.021
There's no other way
to tie off your own arm?

20:23.209 --> 20:24.251
No, sir.

20:25.922 --> 20:27.321
No teeth marks.

20:28.316 --> 20:29.969
Someone tied it for him.

20:35.485 --> 20:37.639
You're in big trouble,
you know that, don't you?

20:37.754 --> 20:38.805
I know.

20:38.843 --> 20:40.495
Can't I just stay
for Kris Kedder though?

20:40.533 --> 20:42.373
He's on next, please,
I've been waiting all year.

20:42.411 --> 20:44.420
Forget about it, Jared.
You're under house arrest.

20:44.477 --> 20:45.737
You're grounded
for two weeks.

20:45.771 --> 20:47.304
- Captain!
- Monk.

20:47.815 --> 20:49.011
Can we get out of here?

20:49.517 --> 20:50.438
Who's this?

20:50.475 --> 20:52.222
This is Kendra,
this is a friend of the guy

20:52.259 --> 20:53.544
they found
in the Port-A-John.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.046
Yeah, I heard
about that, sorry.

20:55.078 --> 20:56.035
Overdose?

20:56.092 --> 20:57.103
I don't think so.

20:57.448 --> 20:58.608
I think he was murdered.

20:58.626 --> 20:59.734
We can't leave yet.

21:03.059 --> 21:04.111
We can't leave?

21:06.238 --> 21:07.646
We can't leave...

21:09.002 --> 21:10.580
I'm so sorry.

21:12.170 --> 21:13.428
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

21:31.760 --> 21:33.020
<i>Did you put this up?</i>

21:33.246 --> 21:34.321
Not me, no.

21:34.354 --> 21:36.624
And it was definitely locked
from the inside?

21:36.661 --> 21:38.617
Yes, sir, uh,
we had to jimmy it.

21:40.179 --> 21:42.113
He says it was locked
from the inside.

21:43.176 --> 21:45.110
They could've rigged
the lock. Over.

21:46.203 --> 21:48.321
<i>Yeah, you know,
it would help things</i>

21:48.354 --> 21:50.254
<i>if you were to stand
a little closer.</i>

21:50.706 --> 21:52.421
That's not gonna happen. Over.

21:52.739 --> 21:54.920
So is this how he does it?
From 100 feet away?

21:55.321 --> 21:56.421
Not all the time.

21:58.418 --> 21:59.638
How long you gonna be?

22:00.446 --> 22:02.500
As long as it takes, miss,
this is a crime scene.

22:02.913 --> 22:03.987
With only one cop?

22:04.447 --> 22:05.720
Ah, it's not just me.

22:06.023 --> 22:08.154
You see that guy up on
the hill, he's a cop.

22:08.392 --> 22:11.020
And, uh, this guy here's
a police officer.

22:11.549 --> 22:12.588
Oh, these guys are great.

22:12.878 --> 22:14.850
<i>Oh, I hope they do Killer Machine!</i>

22:18.966 --> 22:20.900
I'm checking out the lock here.

22:21.820 --> 22:23.135
There are some scratches.

22:23.504 --> 22:24.720
Are they recent? Over.

22:25.122 --> 22:26.493
Yeah, there's no rust.

22:28.886 --> 22:29.975
Hold on.

22:34.508 --> 22:36.537
I got a little piece
of wire here.

22:38.069 --> 22:39.552
It looks like
a guitar string.

22:42.229 --> 22:43.412
Is that a B string?

22:45.277 --> 22:46.286
Nah, it's a D.

22:46.361 --> 22:47.913
A high D
from a 12-string guitar.

22:47.988 --> 22:49.096
Those are pretty rare.

22:49.342 --> 22:50.469
Kris Kedder uses one.

22:51.420 --> 22:53.629
Yeah, yes he does,
on the new single, right?

22:54.234 --> 22:56.287
- I love that solo.
- I love that solo too, man.

22:56.321 --> 22:57.864
Oh, yeah, right near the end. Yeah!

22:58.909 --> 23:01.982
Yeah, it's a guitar string
from a 12-string guitar,

23:02.038 --> 23:03.672
apparently
it's fairly unusual.

23:04.141 --> 23:06.051
Okay, isn't there a vent

23:06.370 --> 23:08.902
<i>on the right side,
up near the roof? Over.</i>

23:10.874 --> 23:13.887
Yeah, Roger that,
about 3 1/2 feet above the lock.

23:15.958 --> 23:18.230
He must've been killed
somewhere else.

23:19.588 --> 23:23.548
They put the body inside,
tied the wire around the bolt--

23:23.585 --> 23:25.707
And ran the wire
through the vent

23:25.745 --> 23:27.996
so they could lock the door
from the outside.

23:32.677 --> 23:35.663
<i>Yeah, you didn't wait
for me to say "over." Over.</i>

23:38.453 --> 23:40.954
Hello? Over.

23:44.741 --> 23:45.849
Over.

23:48.196 --> 23:49.417
I'm saying "over."

23:50.843 --> 23:52.672
You're right,
there's a contusion.

23:52.728 --> 23:53.848
And some hemorrhaging.

23:54.399 --> 23:55.819
Was he, uh,
was he hit?

23:55.988 --> 23:59.524
Hit, fell...I'll know more
when I get him under the lights.

24:00.023 --> 24:01.338
I thought Adrian Monk
was here.

24:01.451 --> 24:03.516
<i>Uh, yeah, he's, uh,
he's backstage with Natalie.</i>

24:03.573 --> 24:04.868
<i>They're following a lead.</i>

24:05.351 --> 24:06.835
Oh, I love this song.

24:07.220 --> 24:08.719
I can play this one
on the piano.

24:09.039 --> 24:10.165
Good for you.

24:11.525 --> 24:14.363
Hey, Jared, thanks
for your help

24:14.419 --> 24:15.743
with that guitar string.

24:16.564 --> 24:17.606
I didn't do anything.

24:17.681 --> 24:18.777
Sure you did.

24:18.857 --> 24:22.120
That was an important clue,
and I might have missed it without you.

24:22.320 --> 24:24.216
We make
a pretty good team, huh?

24:26.993 --> 24:27.970
What is that?

24:28.683 --> 24:29.660
<i>What?</i>

24:30.454 --> 24:31.554
Runaway child?

24:32.790 --> 24:34.217
Guess we don't need
this anymore.

24:34.255 --> 24:35.776
Where'd they get
that picture from?

24:37.560 --> 24:38.842
It's when we went
to Cabo.

24:39.029 --> 24:40.588
Was that the only one
you had?

24:42.039 --> 24:44.454
Look, Jared,
it doesn't mean anything.

24:44.487 --> 24:46.466
I'm, uh,
it's a new wallet.

24:46.541 --> 24:47.796
It's not a new wallet, liar.

24:47.834 --> 24:50.177
I bet you have 1,000 pictures
of your girlfriend in there.

24:50.252 --> 24:51.453
Jared, please.

24:51.577 --> 24:52.920
A pretty good team, huh?

24:53.908 --> 24:55.185
Not a team at all.

24:56.388 --> 24:57.354
Or a family.

25:01.119 --> 25:03.241
Hey, this has been tough
on me too.

25:05.148 --> 25:06.819
I lost my family too.

25:21.925 --> 25:23.219
You're on in 20.

25:23.463 --> 25:24.588
Well, thank you, brother.

25:26.365 --> 25:27.473
Excuse me.

25:28.420 --> 25:30.020
This is Adrian Monk
and Natalie Teeger.

25:30.054 --> 25:31.570
- They're with the cops.
- Cops?

25:31.645 --> 25:33.683
Yeah, they're looking
into what happened to Stork.

25:33.702 --> 25:34.923
What's the big mystery?

25:35.243 --> 25:36.954
He's been chasing
that dragon for years.

25:37.802 --> 25:38.854
I tried to help him.

25:38.891 --> 25:40.055
When did you try to help him?

25:40.104 --> 25:42.263
See, now that he's dead,
everyone was his best friend.

25:42.301 --> 25:43.719
Where were you
when he was sinking?

25:43.756 --> 25:44.808
Where were you?

25:57.688 --> 25:58.899
That's a nice song.

25:59.054 --> 26:00.099
Well, thank you.

26:00.143 --> 26:02.254
It comes out next week,
you should buy a copy.

26:02.561 --> 26:03.857
In fact, buy two.

26:04.276 --> 26:06.020
I got my eyes
on this new beach house.

26:06.155 --> 26:11.169
You are Kris Kedder, the famous
rock and roll song singer?

26:12.758 --> 26:13.920
I guess I am.

26:14.159 --> 26:17.931
Right, uh, this...
this was found at the scene.

26:18.062 --> 26:20.019
These are
from a 12-string guitar.

26:20.188 --> 26:22.099
You're the only musician
that has one.

26:22.268 --> 26:23.266
<i>I am.</i>

26:23.341 --> 26:25.016
What are you saying,
Stork was strangled?

26:25.073 --> 26:27.871
I'm not saying anything,
just asking questions.

26:28.902 --> 26:29.820
That's all.

26:30.172 --> 26:32.050
Chill,
you know, out.

26:32.421 --> 26:34.154
Hey, man, anybody
coulda taken it.

26:34.700 --> 26:35.808
I don't lock my case.

26:39.045 --> 26:40.097
Y-you're out of tune.

26:42.285 --> 26:43.787
Do you play, Mr. Monk?

26:43.820 --> 26:45.221
A little bit,
clarinet.

26:47.392 --> 26:48.287
Clarinet.

26:48.321 --> 26:49.870
Hey, man,
maybe you and I can get

26:49.871 --> 26:51.280
together and jam sometime.

26:51.970 --> 26:53.679
When I'm like 87 years old.

26:56.166 --> 26:57.487
You have mud on your boots.

26:58.801 --> 27:00.040
Yes, I do.

27:00.500 --> 27:01.983
I must be
at a rock festival.

27:02.120 --> 27:05.282
It's just that I don't see mud
on anyone else's shoes.

27:06.277 --> 27:07.554
I see some on yours.

27:13.820 --> 27:15.649
You were gonna show me
where Stork lived.

27:15.780 --> 27:17.564
Yeah, he had a camper,
it's back here.

27:17.615 --> 27:20.363
- It's locked.
- I got the key, he trusted me.

27:20.695 --> 27:22.047
You mind if I tag along?

27:23.001 --> 27:24.654
Now you got me kinda curious.

27:48.814 --> 27:49.987
He lived in here?

27:51.192 --> 27:52.120
He loved it.

27:52.647 --> 27:54.919
<i>Between gigs, he'd take off,
camp out.</i>

27:55.369 --> 27:56.588
Sometimes I'd go with him.

27:56.876 --> 27:59.505
What did you do if one of you
wanted to be happy?

28:03.942 --> 28:05.053
Asthma.

28:05.446 --> 28:06.471
Since I was a kid.

28:06.771 --> 28:07.820
It smells like mint.

28:08.258 --> 28:09.621
It's imported from Denmark.

28:10.165 --> 28:11.221
Do you want a hit?

28:11.331 --> 28:12.364
No, thanks.

28:12.983 --> 28:14.035
Rhyming dictionary?

28:14.827 --> 28:16.987
Yeah, he was writing songs.
That was his dream.

28:17.366 --> 28:18.809
<i>He was really shy about it
though.</i>

28:18.884 --> 28:20.480
<i>He wouldn't even play me
his stuff.</i>

28:26.587 --> 28:27.676
Who's this?

28:27.733 --> 28:29.421
Oh, that's his daughter,
Margaret.

28:29.683 --> 28:31.361
Oh, no,
where is she?

28:32.154 --> 28:35.065
Tennessee, her mom
moved her there after they split.

28:36.127 --> 28:37.742
I guess I should call them.

28:37.911 --> 28:39.507
I know I have their number somewhere.

28:39.626 --> 28:41.354
Oh, hell, I'm late.

28:42.057 --> 28:43.421
Gotta go be famous.

28:43.551 --> 28:44.678
Catch you later.

28:46.295 --> 28:47.441
You'll catch me later?

29:05.942 --> 29:06.946
What?

29:07.528 --> 29:08.599
Something's wrong.

29:08.655 --> 29:10.383
Did either of you move
anything?

29:10.796 --> 29:12.486
No.
No.

29:13.719 --> 29:15.680
Something's different--
there was an envelope.

29:15.755 --> 29:17.746
White envelope, right here.

29:18.532 --> 29:19.715
There was?

29:23.765 --> 29:24.883
It's a receipt.

29:25.259 --> 29:28.064
Registered mail,
he mailed something to himself.

29:28.254 --> 29:29.321
<i>I remember that.</i>

29:29.354 --> 29:30.553
That was about six months ago,

29:30.572 --> 29:32.037
I went to the post office
with him.

29:32.154 --> 29:33.719
He was mailing sheet music
to himself.

29:33.960 --> 29:35.421
He called it
his insurance policy.

29:36.150 --> 29:37.258
What song?

29:37.844 --> 29:38.896
I don't know.

29:39.220 --> 29:40.178
I think I do.

29:40.968 --> 29:43.616
The song Kris Kedder
was just singing.

29:43.997 --> 29:45.237
<i>Peggy's Gone to Memphis.</i>

29:45.305 --> 29:46.665
Kedder didn't write that song.

29:46.702 --> 29:49.497
Stork wrote it
about his daughter.

29:49.760 --> 29:51.588
Peggy is short
for Margaret.

29:51.803 --> 29:54.074
<i>Peggy's Gone to Memphis.</i>

29:54.186 --> 29:56.058
Oh, my God, he just took
that envelope.

29:57.541 --> 29:59.738
We can't prove anything
without that envelope.

30:07.536 --> 30:09.996
- Coming through!
- Excuse me.

30:11.387 --> 30:12.898
Move it, move, move, move!

30:26.403 --> 30:27.953
Do you think he still
has it on him?

30:28.141 --> 30:29.343
I don't know.

30:38.197 --> 30:39.587
You are a God!

31:09.586 --> 31:11.020
He's gonna burn it,
go, go, go, go!

31:11.054 --> 31:12.321
<i>Go, go!
Excuse me, come here.</i>

32:02.064 --> 32:03.491
Wait, you--Kris Kedder?

32:03.566 --> 32:04.674
You mean the singer?

32:05.088 --> 32:07.144
- He's the guy.
- No, no, no, that's not possible.

32:07.219 --> 32:08.571
I've known Kris Kedder
for years.

32:08.590 --> 32:10.331
- Personally?
- No.

32:10.481 --> 32:12.002
Here's what happened!

32:16.513 --> 32:19.048
The roadie, Stork,
wrote a song.

32:19.187 --> 32:20.194
What?

32:20.354 --> 32:23.655
The roadie, Stork,
wrote a song!

32:24.201 --> 32:26.154
Kris Kedder stole it!

32:27.234 --> 32:29.769
<i>Stork must have confronted
Kedder!</i>

32:31.497 --> 32:32.994
Kris killed him!

32:33.238 --> 32:34.233
What?

32:36.021 --> 32:38.842
<i>He tried to make it look
like Stork OD'd!</i>

32:39.389 --> 32:42.000
<i>So he stuffed him
into the hell hole!</i>

32:42.353 --> 32:44.214
You mean that Port-A-John!

32:44.458 --> 32:46.389
- No, I mean the hell hole!
- The hell what?

32:48.124 --> 32:50.546
<i>At some point, he remembered</i>

32:50.621 --> 32:54.039
<i>that Stork was off drugs
and that he was afraid</i>

32:54.114 --> 32:55.469
<i>of needles!</i>

32:59.148 --> 33:01.113
<i>He knew that nobody
would believe</i>

33:01.207 --> 33:03.654
<i>that Stork OD'd like that!</i>

33:05.667 --> 33:09.472
<i>Then he had to make it look
like Stork was back on drugs</i>

33:10.035 --> 33:13.538
<i>and over his fear of needles,
so he disguised himself</i>

33:13.857 --> 33:16.264
<i>and he went
to the acupuncturist!</i>

33:17.266 --> 33:18.720
<i>And he made sure he mentioned</i>

33:18.787 --> 33:20.289
<i>he was looking
for heroin!</i>

33:20.492 --> 33:21.469
Right.

33:22.580 --> 33:25.581
<i>And he put the map</i>

33:25.981 --> 33:30.338
<i>in Stork's pocket to lead us
to the acupuncturist.</i>

33:37.876 --> 33:40.021
<i>And he closed the door.</i>

33:40.054 --> 33:42.729
<i>And he locked it
from the outside.</i>

33:43.866 --> 33:45.487
God, I can't hear
the music.

33:45.724 --> 33:47.120
I think I've gone deaf.

33:47.271 --> 33:49.129
Mr. Monk, the song is over.

33:49.335 --> 33:53.130
Monk, it doesn't matter,
the--the D.A. not gonna buy it!

33:53.418 --> 33:54.676
<i>We don't have anything!</i>

33:54.695 --> 33:56.722
We don't have
any real physical evidence!

33:57.041 --> 33:58.864
What about--
what about the sheet music?

33:59.014 --> 34:00.687
Nah, he burned it onstage!

34:00.720 --> 34:03.087
All we got are these--
these guitar strings!

34:03.363 --> 34:05.560
And that's not enough,
and you know it.

34:13.565 --> 34:15.020
The beach ball,
the beach ball!

34:15.634 --> 34:16.771
Excuse me?

34:17.579 --> 34:19.554
When he was pretending
to be Stork,

34:19.877 --> 34:22.694
<i>and he was still--
still in disguise,</i>

34:23.188 --> 34:26.420
Kedder blew up
that blue beach ball!

34:27.094 --> 34:29.440
There's a million fingerprints
on that ball, Monk!

34:29.498 --> 34:31.328
The proof is not
on the beach ball,

34:32.061 --> 34:35.158
- it's in the beach ball.
- Oh, the asthma!

34:35.289 --> 34:36.246
In the beach ball?

34:36.379 --> 34:37.956
Kris Kedder has asthma!

34:38.145 --> 34:41.065
He uses an inhaler,
very distinctive inhaler.

34:41.178 --> 34:43.187
And it's mint-flavored,
it's one of a kind.

34:43.300 --> 34:46.562
If we can get that blue beach ball
to the lab intact...

34:46.656 --> 34:48.472
You're talking about the air
inside the ball!

34:48.527 --> 34:49.237
Yes!

34:49.293 --> 34:52.054
There was a witness, somebody
who witnessed him blowing it up!

34:52.087 --> 34:54.087
And he was impersonating the victim!

34:54.197 --> 34:55.511
Is that enough?

34:56.603 --> 34:57.655
Yes.

34:57.693 --> 34:59.084
- Get that ball!
- There it is!

35:04.254 --> 35:05.620
I got it!

35:07.800 --> 35:09.288
I'm a police officer!

35:09.320 --> 35:10.353
<i>I need that ball!</i>

35:10.718 --> 35:12.484
I need that beach ball!

35:23.231 --> 35:24.733
Oh, please sweetie,
right here.

35:24.790 --> 35:25.785
Right here.

35:30.887 --> 35:32.921
<i>That ball, I need
that beach ball!</i>

35:32.954 --> 35:34.987
<i>Right there, that one,
the beach ball!</i>

35:35.587 --> 35:38.284
Miss, I'm a police officer,
I need you to drop that ball.

35:38.341 --> 35:39.467
Okay.

35:52.943 --> 35:55.384
- Hey, what the hell are you doing?
- Whoa, whoa, calm down.

35:55.422 --> 35:58.201
We got a police emergency here.
This guy needs to talk to the crowd.

36:03.593 --> 36:05.063
Excuse me, hello.

36:06.171 --> 36:08.554
I don't mean
to kill your buzz.

36:08.587 --> 36:09.597
Go home!

36:10.364 --> 36:12.020
I am a former police officer.

36:12.909 --> 36:15.313
Thank you, thank you very much.
Take it easy.

36:15.669 --> 36:16.821
Everybody chill.

36:19.724 --> 36:22.464
That blue beach ball contains
material evidence

36:22.614 --> 36:24.364
in a homicide investigation.

36:25.171 --> 36:29.354
So we need you to bring
the blue beach ball

36:29.523 --> 36:30.969
down to the stage.

36:31.006 --> 36:32.283
Hey, you suck!

36:33.519 --> 36:34.887
Yes, I know.

36:35.346 --> 36:36.353
<i>I know.</i>

36:37.431 --> 36:39.403
It's true.
I am a straight.

36:40.320 --> 36:41.710
But I have a dream.

36:42.888 --> 36:45.154
A dream that someday
all the hippies

36:45.849 --> 36:49.250
and all the straights
can live together

36:49.663 --> 36:51.034
side by side.

36:51.832 --> 36:52.865
Not too close.

36:53.774 --> 36:55.092
Because, you know, the smell.

36:55.144 --> 36:56.219
Go home!

36:56.406 --> 36:57.787
You know, the hippie smell.

37:03.520 --> 37:06.660
Okay, okay, people,
I need that ball!

37:06.998 --> 37:08.087
I'm not joking!

37:08.808 --> 37:10.486
Music! Music!

37:10.599 --> 37:11.726
All right, that's it.

37:11.763 --> 37:13.566
That--that's obstruction!

37:13.641 --> 37:14.954
<i>You're all under arrest!</i>

37:14.987 --> 37:17.416
- If you cannot afford an attorney--
- Hey, forget this!

37:17.453 --> 37:19.725
From the chorus,
one, two, three, four!

37:36.854 --> 37:38.853
<i>Police officer,
I need that ball!</i>

37:40.647 --> 37:41.812
We need that ball!

38:08.377 --> 38:10.320
Good job, son,
give me the ball.

38:11.315 --> 38:13.343
Don't! Don't you do it.

38:14.518 --> 38:15.720
He's a cop.

38:16.707 --> 38:17.722
What's your name?

38:17.853 --> 38:19.318
- Jared.
- Jared.

38:19.393 --> 38:22.677
Jared, this is very important,
give me the ball.

38:22.846 --> 38:26.101
Hey, man, you do everything
the cops tell you?

38:27.069 --> 38:28.158
You know I don't.

38:29.334 --> 38:30.538
I like your shirt.

38:30.914 --> 38:31.837
Thanks, man.

38:32.024 --> 38:33.485
<i>You play?
Yeah.</i>

38:33.804 --> 38:35.452
Me and you,
we should jam sometime.

38:36.574 --> 38:38.246
Jared, listen to me.

38:39.149 --> 38:42.078
If he deflates that ball,
we don't have a case.

38:42.285 --> 38:43.854
<i>Dude, he's trying
to set me up.</i>

38:44.377 --> 38:45.487
'Cause of what I am.

38:45.932 --> 38:47.002
What I represent.

38:47.040 --> 38:48.087
That's nonsense!

38:48.173 --> 38:49.112
Jared,

38:51.403 --> 38:54.528
you might not like me,
but you know me.

38:58.490 --> 39:01.439
You don't trust cops,
do you?

39:08.805 --> 39:10.054
I trust this one.

39:10.764 --> 39:12.135
Don't--don't do it!

39:13.506 --> 39:14.420
Punk!

39:28.103 --> 39:29.493
Be careful with this.

39:29.854 --> 39:30.939
You know Detective Kramer?

39:30.995 --> 39:32.414
He's waiting for this
at the lab.

39:32.470 --> 39:34.179
Hey, check this T-shirt out.

39:34.283 --> 39:35.447
Sweet, huh?

39:35.522 --> 39:37.887
That's gonna be worth
a fortune when he's convicted.

39:37.921 --> 39:38.897
Exactly.

39:39.055 --> 39:41.320
Mr. Monk, what did you think
of your first rock concert?

39:41.353 --> 39:42.875
I like the old songs.

39:43.632 --> 39:46.017
Why don't people write
old songs anymore?

39:46.092 --> 39:47.613
I don't know, Mr. Monk.

39:47.782 --> 39:49.880
Hey, we'll meet you guys
back at the car.

39:50.878 --> 39:51.860
Jared, what do you think?

39:51.898 --> 39:53.851
How about a couple of pictures
for my wallet?

39:54.230 --> 39:56.427
So I got a good one
for the next time you take off.

39:56.634 --> 39:57.742
All right.
