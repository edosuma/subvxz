<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:02.936 --> 00:06.770
Marry me, Haley. Marry me again
in front of all our friends and our family.

00:06.840 --> 00:09.365
I can't believe your Uncle Cooper
slept with Rachel.

00:09.442 --> 00:11.273
I'm pregnant.

00:12.312 --> 00:13.711
Look out!

00:17.917 --> 00:21.045
You're the one who saved everybody.
You're a hero, Nate.

00:21.888 --> 00:23.685
You tried to kill me in the dealership fire.

00:23.757 --> 00:24.883
So you be afraid, Deb.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.118
Be more than afraid.

00:26.192 --> 00:28.251
It's pretty cool that you and Keith
are having a baby.

00:28.328 --> 00:30.694
It's kind of like a part of him
is coming back to us.

00:30.764 --> 00:33.164
I think I still have feelings for Lucas.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.594
You're a backstabbing,
two-faced bitch, Peyton.

00:36.669 --> 00:39.797
I know it's been difficult for you,
losing Keith and your heart condition

00:39.873 --> 00:41.397
and giving up basketball.

00:41.474 --> 00:42.907
- Brooke...
- I'm sorry.

00:42.976 --> 00:45.137
I can't do this anymore.

00:45.211 --> 00:47.179
You're definitely pregnant.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.786
You are no longer my brother.

<i>There are moments in our lives</i>

01:35.428 --> 01:39.660

01:47.907 --> 01:49.772
She broke up with you?

01:50.443 --> 01:53.344
Well, did she say
why she broke up with you?

01:54.481 --> 01:57.917
She said she loved me,
but she didn't miss me anymore.

01:58.384 --> 02:00.011
I don't know.
She said it wasn't 'cause of you.

02:00.086 --> 02:02.281
- Because of me?
- Our kiss in the library.

02:02.355 --> 02:03.822
She said it wasn't that, but if that's true,

02:03.890 --> 02:06.723
then there's something
that she's not telling me.

02:07.727 --> 02:10.092
You know what, Lucas?

02:10.763 --> 02:15.097
The night of Nathan and Haley's
rehearsal dinner, I said something to...

02:19.105 --> 02:20.538
It's the fuse box.

02:20.607 --> 02:24.043
Or maybe Brooke cut the power
and she's coming to kill us both.

02:24.110 --> 02:25.134
Funny.

02:25.211 --> 02:27.372
It should kick back on in a second.

02:28.848 --> 02:31.078
Yeah, this happens once in a while.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.882
- It still kind of freaks me out.
- It's okay. I'm right here.

02:35.955 --> 02:37.923
Here, give me your hand.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.797
I'm gonna get her back.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.257
Lucas, are you sure?

02:48.334 --> 02:50.825
'Cause, I mean,
I know you're really hurt right now, but...

02:50.904 --> 02:53.532
You can't help who you love, Peyton.

02:56.976 --> 02:59.570
- You should probably get that checked.
- Yeah.

03:00.747 --> 03:02.647
Oh, do you know what time it is?

03:02.715 --> 03:05.707
Oh, yeah, midnight.

03:07.153 --> 03:09.747
- You know what that means, right?
- No.

03:11.591 --> 03:14.025
It's officially Brooke's birthday.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.475
Posh, it looks like it's just you and me.

03:40.453 --> 03:42.318
Happy birthday, Brooke.

03:42.388 --> 03:43.878
Welcome to 18.

03:45.024 --> 03:47.720
You've certainly made a mess of it.

03:50.296 --> 03:51.490
Hey.

03:54.200 --> 03:57.397
Hey. I was worried about you.

03:57.704 --> 03:59.763
Well, I went to visit Cooper.

03:59.839 --> 04:03.639
- How is he?
- There's no change. Still unconscious.

04:06.646 --> 04:11.140
I saw Rachel grab the wheel from Cooper.
And if he doesn't...

04:12.051 --> 04:15.043
If he doesn't make it, she's to blame.

04:17.223 --> 04:20.158
- Did you see anything else?
- What do you mean?

04:20.226 --> 04:24.390
Like maybe someone else in the water?

04:26.599 --> 04:29.693
I don't... I don't understand.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.031
I mean, other than Rachel and Cooper,

04:31.104 --> 04:33.971
you and Lucas were the only ones
in the water. Why?

04:38.378 --> 04:39.538
Hello?

04:39.646 --> 04:40.738
Yeah.

04:41.748 --> 04:43.010
Oh, okay.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.010
Great. Thank you.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.476
Cooper's awake.

04:55.828 --> 04:57.056
Mr. Lee?

04:57.930 --> 04:59.727
I'm Detective Reeves.

04:59.866 --> 05:01.197
Welcome back.

05:01.267 --> 05:05.397
Look, I know you're still weak,
so I'll keep this brief.

05:05.738 --> 05:08.263
We've been told that you were
behind the wheel of the limousine

05:08.341 --> 05:10.104
when it left the bridge.

05:10.176 --> 05:11.643
Is that true?

05:14.047 --> 05:15.071
What happened?

05:15.148 --> 05:16.877
<i>- I said pull over!</i>
<i>- No!</i>

05:16.949 --> 05:18.780
- We're gonna talk about it!
- I said pull over!

05:18.851 --> 05:20.580
I'm not pulling the car over!

05:29.696 --> 05:31.288
It was my fault.

05:33.666 --> 05:36.157
- Mr. Lee...
- We were going too fast,

05:36.869 --> 05:38.598
and I lost control.

05:40.373 --> 05:41.931
I'm the one to blame.

05:45.745 --> 05:46.837
Okay.

05:53.386 --> 05:54.410
Hi.

05:57.056 --> 06:00.253
- Cooper, I'm so sorry.
- Is everything okay?

06:02.328 --> 06:03.693
Yeah, I'm fine.

06:03.763 --> 06:06.459
- I was just scared that you...
- The baby, Rachel.

06:06.532 --> 06:09.092
I meant, is the baby okay?

06:13.840 --> 06:16.400
Cooper, when we were arguing, I was...

06:16.976 --> 06:19.638
I was so angry. I was hurt.

06:20.613 --> 06:23.548
So when I said I was pregnant, I was just...

06:26.319 --> 06:27.547
Get out.

06:27.653 --> 06:29.848
- Cooper...
- I said get out!

06:53.446 --> 06:55.641
- Package for Dan Scott?
- Yeah.

06:57.383 --> 06:58.850
Here you are.

07:00.520 --> 07:03.387
And sign here, Mr. Murderer.

07:04.223 --> 07:08.182
- What did you say?
- You need to sign for it, Mr. Mayor.

07:10.730 --> 07:12.288
From now on,
I want you to leave all packages

07:12.365 --> 07:14.356
up front with one of the assistants.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.834
- You got that?
- Yes, sir.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.415
- So Brooke just broke up with you?
- Yep.

07:30.483 --> 07:32.644
- Man, that's cold, dawg.
- Oh, yeah.

07:32.718 --> 07:34.913
Although you did kiss Peyton.

07:36.889 --> 07:39.483
Do you want me to get you a tryout
with the Ravens or what?

07:39.559 --> 07:43.495
Yes, I do. But that still don't mean
you didn't kiss Peyton.

07:43.563 --> 07:46.157
- I love Brooke, Skills.
- I know you love her.

07:46.232 --> 07:48.962
So what, you gonna try and get her back?

07:49.202 --> 07:50.294
Yeah.

07:52.839 --> 07:55.069
I'm not too sure
that's the way to do it, but, hey.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.974
- What's up, home-wrecker?
- Hi, Skills.

07:59.645 --> 08:03.012
- I see word's out.
- Yeah. I'm sorry about that.

08:03.716 --> 08:05.047
What's up?

08:05.151 --> 08:07.915
Well, I have a question to ask you.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.614
But before you give me an answer,

08:09.689 --> 08:11.213
I just want you to know
there's a point to it.

08:11.290 --> 08:12.917
- Okay?
- Okay.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.524
All right.

08:16.496 --> 08:20.023
Imagine a future moment in your life
where all your dreams come true.

08:20.099 --> 08:22.260
You know,
it's the greatest moment in your life,

08:22.335 --> 08:24.895
and you get to experience it
with one person.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.863
Who's standing next to you?

08:28.341 --> 08:30.901
- Kate Bosworth.
- Shut up! I'm serious.

08:30.977 --> 08:33.467
- Oh, so am I.
- Luke, come on.

08:33.546 --> 08:35.878
I mean, it could be anybody.
You know, your mom, Haley...

08:35.948 --> 08:37.575
Your boy Skills.

08:39.418 --> 08:41.078
Who's it gonna be?

08:44.190 --> 08:45.384
Brooke.

08:46.592 --> 08:47.923
All right.

08:48.194 --> 08:52.187
If that's what you really want,
then I have a way for you to get her back.

09:39.679 --> 09:41.476
Nice.

09:41.547 --> 09:44.516
A little psychotic, but nice.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.577
- You got some hip-hop in here?
- Just some old-school stuff.

09:48.654 --> 09:51.987
There's Public Enemy,
and then A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul.

09:52.058 --> 09:54.822
Peyton Sawyer,
getting sexier by the album.

09:54.894 --> 09:56.486
- Mind if I look?
- Have at it.

09:56.562 --> 09:59.531
But if you find a Led Zeppelin album
with a letter from my second dead mom

09:59.599 --> 10:01.897
telling me about a biological half-brother
I've never met,

10:01.968 --> 10:03.230
just go ahead and skip that one.

10:03.302 --> 10:07.261
You know, that sounds like a whole lot of
white girl drama I really don't understand,

10:07.340 --> 10:10.173
- but okay.
- Speaking of that half-brother,

10:10.242 --> 10:11.800
- did you call him yet?
- Yes.

10:11.877 --> 10:13.811
But I hung up before he answered.

10:13.879 --> 10:15.710
- Peyton.
- Look, I was gonna call him back,

10:15.781 --> 10:20.275
but you came in here crying
like a schoolgirl, so I just... I haven't.

10:21.687 --> 10:23.552
Look, Ellie, she was pretty sharp, Peyton,

10:23.623 --> 10:25.614
and there's probably a reason
she left you his number.

10:25.691 --> 10:29.457
And there is probably a reason
that you called him.

10:29.528 --> 10:32.088
And I did not cry like a little schoolgirl.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.823
You find anything good over there, Skills?

10:34.900 --> 10:36.925
Oh, I'm actually just pretending
to be looking

10:37.003 --> 10:38.937
so I can hear all your business.

10:39.672 --> 10:41.037
I'm just waiting to hear the plan

10:41.107 --> 10:44.008
how you gonna get Brooke back
for this crying little schoolgirl here.

10:44.076 --> 10:45.509
Yeah, I'm waiting to hear that plan, too.

10:45.578 --> 10:46.738
And I was not crying like a schoolgirl.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.780
- Yes, you was.
- Okay. All right. Hey. Check it out.

10:48.848 --> 10:51.282
So, ever since Brooke turned nine,

10:51.350 --> 10:53.318
we've kind of had this ritual
on her birthday

10:53.386 --> 10:56.514
where we go to her favorite store
at the mall half an hour before closing.

10:56.589 --> 10:59.990
She picks out a gift, and I steal it for her.

11:00.059 --> 11:04.325
- You shoplift Brooke's birthday present.
- Yeah, sort of. That's...

11:04.397 --> 11:05.694
Okay, my dad's friends with the manager,

11:05.765 --> 11:07.130
so I would just come home and tell him

11:07.199 --> 11:08.496
what we took, and then we'd pay for it.

11:08.567 --> 11:10.831
But we never told Brooke.
She was all crazy for the juice.

11:10.903 --> 11:15.237
So I just figured,
maybe if you go in my place this year

11:15.307 --> 11:17.673
and you're not a complete bonehead
in the romance department,

11:17.743 --> 11:19.074
then maybe you've got a shot.

11:19.145 --> 11:20.976
And you've done this every year
for how many years?

11:21.047 --> 11:23.242
This would've been the tenth.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.385
But she's pissed at you now.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.956
So A, why would you help her?

11:31.023 --> 11:32.684
And B,

11:33.959 --> 11:36.519
what makes you think
she's even gonna show up?

11:36.595 --> 11:39.189
I'm not helping her, I'm helping you.

11:40.132 --> 11:41.292
Besides, if she does show,

11:41.367 --> 11:43.267
then not only is there hope
for the two of you,

11:43.335 --> 11:45.701
but maybe there's some hope for me, too.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.507
What do you think, Skills?

11:48.574 --> 11:50.974
Man, you lost me at Led Zeppelin.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.742
It's worth a try.

12:01.787 --> 12:02.981
What are you doing?

12:03.055 --> 12:07.424
Seeing what it was like
to be you before the surgeries.

12:08.527 --> 12:09.687
You're funny.

12:09.762 --> 12:13.823
No, I'm actually thinking of doing
a maternity line for Clothes Over Bro's.

12:13.899 --> 12:16.265
You know, all the singers and starlets
are preggers right now.

12:16.335 --> 12:17.996
- It's very in.
- Right.

12:21.006 --> 12:24.442
Rachel, you shouldn't have. Wow.

12:24.877 --> 12:25.935
What?

12:26.011 --> 12:28.445
My birthday.
You're the first one to remember.

12:28.514 --> 12:30.004
It's your birthday?

12:30.649 --> 12:32.241
Or not remember.

12:35.121 --> 12:36.486
They're from my parents.

12:36.555 --> 12:38.955
They came with a card that basically said,

12:39.024 --> 12:42.460
"Glad you didn't die.
The Italian Riviera misses you."

12:43.262 --> 12:45.230
At least they sent flowers.

12:45.297 --> 12:47.788
My parents forgot my 18th birthday.

12:48.801 --> 12:53.329
Here you go. Happy birthday.
And you didn't even have to almost die.

12:53.405 --> 12:55.805
Secondhand death flowers. Thanks.

12:56.208 --> 12:57.675
Shoot me now.

13:02.848 --> 13:04.076
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.

13:04.150 --> 13:06.448
No one's waited on our table
in about 15 minutes.

13:06.519 --> 13:10.888
- I ordered the Reuben, not the tuna salad.
- Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

13:10.956 --> 13:13.254
But judging from the size of your ass,

13:13.325 --> 13:16.624
maybe you should try the tuna salad
and consider it a favor.

13:19.598 --> 13:21.566
- To go, then?
- Let's go.

13:26.305 --> 13:29.206
Too bad. The tuna salad's delicious.

13:30.276 --> 13:32.210
Come again, fat ass!

13:38.350 --> 13:40.784
Coop? How you doing?

13:42.388 --> 13:44.356
I guess I'm still alive.

13:45.191 --> 13:46.522
Come here.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.657
Thank you.

13:50.696 --> 13:53.062
They told me that you saved both of us.

13:55.901 --> 13:58.893
I didn't save anyone.

13:59.905 --> 14:03.363
I tried to help you, Coop,
but I couldn't get you out of there.

14:03.776 --> 14:06.836
And then I ran out of air and I panicked.

14:07.713 --> 14:10.876
Then everything went black,
just like it did for you.

14:15.054 --> 14:18.854
I didn't save you, Cooper.
I couldn't even save myself.

14:18.924 --> 14:21.017
- That's okay.
- No, it's not.

14:22.161 --> 14:24.493
People think I'm a hero, but they're wrong.

14:24.563 --> 14:26.155
You're the hero.

14:26.599 --> 14:29.261
Look, I heard you told Reeves
that it was your fault.

14:29.335 --> 14:31.235
- It wasn't.
- Sure it was.

14:31.303 --> 14:33.396
Haley saw Rachel grab the wheel.

14:36.375 --> 14:40.141
Listen to me. No matter what happened
on that bridge, it was still my fault.

14:40.212 --> 14:43.545
I knew how old Rachel was,
and I didn't walk away.

14:43.616 --> 14:45.447
It's not very heroic, is it?

14:46.352 --> 14:50.846
Anyways, I wouldn't even be alive
to say anything if it wasn't for you.

14:50.923 --> 14:52.254
Hey, I told you, I didn't save...

14:52.324 --> 14:55.725
Look, even if you don't remember it, Nate,
it doesn't mean it didn't happen.

14:55.794 --> 14:59.423
You jumped in that river
and you tried to save both of us.

15:00.666 --> 15:04.762
We're here. We're still alive.
Isn't that what really matters?

15:08.674 --> 15:10.801
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:25.724 --> 15:26.918
<i>Hello?</i>

15:29.094 --> 15:30.254
Hi.

15:31.563 --> 15:34.191
- I'm looking for Derek.
<i>- Who's calling?</i>

15:35.834 --> 15:37.927
This is Peyton Sawyer.

15:38.671 --> 15:41.162
I'm sorry, this is gonna sound so strange.

15:42.574 --> 15:46.305
- My mom's name was Ellie Harp, and she...
<i>- Don't call here again.</i>

16:07.900 --> 16:09.731
Hey, Coach, you need a ride?

16:18.911 --> 16:21.778
He's quick, Coach. Has a great first step.

16:22.214 --> 16:24.079
You flattened my tire.

16:24.516 --> 16:27.451
Look, just give him a look, all right?
He's a good guy.

16:27.519 --> 16:29.783
I mean, he can score off the dribble.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.088
He's way quicker than me on defense.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.682
And you know
defense wins championships.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.990
You're gonna change that tire.

16:37.363 --> 16:40.799
Look, state rules allow for roster moves
until Friday. I looked it up.

16:40.866 --> 16:42.697
Look, Coach, come on.
He wants to go to college,

16:42.768 --> 16:45.601
and this could really help him with that.
Nathan's a little banged up.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.731
You're hard selling me, and I don't like it.

16:49.975 --> 16:51.704
Just think about it, okay?

16:52.878 --> 16:54.072
Please.

16:55.647 --> 16:58.548
I don't even have
a damn spare for that car.

17:04.890 --> 17:07.882
- Hi.
- I need to talk to you.

17:08.227 --> 17:10.694
Okay, well,
things are a little crazy right now.

17:10.762 --> 17:13.027
Rachel caught me
making maternity clothes.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.291
Brooke!

17:14.800 --> 17:16.665
On the list of people
that know about this pregnancy,

17:16.734 --> 17:18.099
I'm thinking Rachel's not really on the top.

17:18.170 --> 17:21.070
- I know!
- Okay, well, calm down. And...

17:21.707 --> 17:23.071
Does she suspect anything at all?

17:23.142 --> 17:25.838
- No, I don't think so.
- Okay. So it's just you and me that knows.

17:25.911 --> 17:28.378
Good. So let's just keep it that way.
I think that's best, don't you?

17:28.446 --> 17:30.506
I think I'd feel better
if I didn't even know about it.

17:30.582 --> 17:33.210
It's a little late for that, isn't it?

17:33.519 --> 17:36.511
Well, did you and Lucas ever talk
about what would happen if you...

17:36.588 --> 17:41.616
Yeah. Last year. And, you know, he...

17:41.693 --> 17:44.457
I mean, he said he'd be there
for me and the baby,

17:44.530 --> 17:47.431
but I could tell he was scared
and feeling trapped and he just...

17:47.499 --> 17:49.933
- He wasn't ready.
- Yeah, I know.

17:50.536 --> 17:52.333
I mean, did you and Nathan
ever talk about it?

17:52.404 --> 17:53.393
Yeah, don't you remember?

17:53.472 --> 17:54.837
It was that night that we spent together

17:54.907 --> 17:57.273
and then he found out I wasn't on the pill
and he freaked out.

17:57.342 --> 17:58.900
It was, like, the worst fight we ever had.

17:58.977 --> 18:00.569
Brooke, I gotta get back out there.
I'm sorry.

18:00.646 --> 18:04.013
- It's crazy, and Deb's out to lunch.
- This is an awfully late lunch.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.881
She's here. She's literally out to lunch.

18:06.952 --> 18:08.977
- I'll call you later.
- Haley?

18:10.155 --> 18:11.850
It's gonna be okay, right?

18:12.491 --> 18:15.551
Yeah, Brooke, it's gonna be okay.

18:19.231 --> 18:20.425
I hope.

18:23.969 --> 18:25.869
Deb, I don't know what...

18:33.045 --> 18:34.034
Oops.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.442
<i>The car crashed through the guardrail,</i>

18:39.518 --> 18:42.646
<i>rolled over</i>
<i>and was completely submerged.</i>

18:42.721 --> 18:45.554
<i>That's when Nathan Scott...</i>

18:45.624 --> 18:50.459
<i>Nathan is the son of recently elected</i>
<i>Tree Hill Mayor Dan Scott,</i>

18:50.562 --> 18:54.965
<i>who touted family as one of</i>
<i>his campaign staples, as you'll see here.</i>

18:56.401 --> 19:00.667
<i>I'm Dan Scott, local businessman,</i>
<i>school board member and murderer.</i>

19:00.739 --> 19:04.505
<i>Family first, that's my motto.</i>
<i>Making a better...</i>

19:07.713 --> 19:11.877
<i>I'm Dan Scott, local businessman,</i>
<i>school board member and father.</i>

19:12.284 --> 19:16.345
<i>Family first, that's my motto.</i>
<i>Making a better Tree Hill for all of us.</i>

19:16.421 --> 19:19.390
<i>Now, authorities tell us</i>
<i>that if it wasn't for Nathan Scott,</i>

19:19.458 --> 19:22.291
<i>this accident could've been much worse.</i>

19:28.500 --> 19:29.694
Cooper...

19:31.770 --> 19:33.670
- Nathan.
- Cooper's gone.

19:35.474 --> 19:38.637
- You mean released.
- Gone from Tree Hill, Rachel.

19:41.580 --> 19:47.746
Look, I'm really sorry, Nathan,
for the way I acted at the reception

19:49.388 --> 19:50.980
and everything else.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.291
I know that you saved my life,

19:55.794 --> 19:57.284
and I'm gonna find a way to thank you.

19:57.362 --> 20:01.025
- You don't have to do that.
- No, I want to.

20:11.343 --> 20:13.243
You have Cooper's eyes.

20:46.411 --> 20:48.072
Hi, guys. Peyton here.

20:48.180 --> 20:53.083
If you've been listening to my podcasts,
then you know a lot about me.

20:53.518 --> 20:57.249
But did you know I had a brother?
Yeah, well, neither did I.

20:58.690 --> 21:00.123
His name's Derek.

21:00.192 --> 21:02.092
Same father, different mom.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.822
It's kind of the Tree Hill way of life,
I guess.

21:04.896 --> 21:09.890
Anyway, I tried calling him today,
but he hung up on me, which is cool.

21:09.968 --> 21:13.904
You know, I fully understand
the inability to let people in

21:13.972 --> 21:18.932
because that's exactly
how I was with Ellie at first.

21:20.078 --> 21:22.842
But you know what?
It does lead me to believe

21:22.914 --> 21:25.712
that Derek and I
probably have some things in common.

21:26.385 --> 21:32.119
So anyway,
Derek from St. Flora, North Carolina,

21:33.525 --> 21:35.356
maybe you'll reconsider.

21:35.427 --> 21:38.919
You know,
maybe you'll listen to my podcasts,

21:38.997 --> 21:40.931
or you can go to my MySpace page,
you know.

21:40.999 --> 21:44.298
It has everything you could ever
want to know about me there,

21:44.369 --> 21:46.132
except maybe this.

21:47.439 --> 21:50.408
I would really like to talk to you sometime.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.777
About anything you want.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.244
And I hope your world is good to you.

22:02.854 --> 22:07.223
- Spring cleaning?
- Oh, no, just pieces from Lucas' old crib.

22:07.626 --> 22:10.459
I was feeling sentimental.
I thought I'd try to use them again.

22:10.529 --> 22:14.966
And then I realized
that thing is thirdhand 17 years ago.

22:15.033 --> 22:16.295
Well, congratulations.

22:16.368 --> 22:18.029
I haven't seen you,
and things have been so crazy lately.

22:18.103 --> 22:20.970
Thank you so much. I know.
I can't believe I'm gonna have a child.

22:21.039 --> 22:23.269
Well, it'll be easier this time, right?

22:23.342 --> 22:27.779
I mean, getting pregnant at 17
was probably really difficult for you

22:27.846 --> 22:31.282
and your family and your friends
you had to confide in and...

22:33.352 --> 22:35.377
Listen, Haley,

22:35.921 --> 22:40.324
normally I wouldn't go behind Lucas' back,

22:41.293 --> 22:44.922
but he found a pregnancy test
in Brooke's purse at the wedding.

22:44.996 --> 22:47.931
And he claims
that she's not pregnant, but...

22:49.234 --> 22:51.759
You would tell me if you knew otherwise,
wouldn't you?

22:51.837 --> 22:56.433
I don't. But, listen, I came
to talk to you about Deb.

22:56.508 --> 23:00.467
- What about Deb?
- Well, we had a little...

23:00.779 --> 23:03.441
A little accident at the café today.

23:20.799 --> 23:21.788
Deb!

23:21.867 --> 23:23.892
What happened?
Haley came by and told me that...

23:23.969 --> 23:25.129
Haley.

23:26.571 --> 23:29.802
I knew that little bitch
couldn't keep her big mouth shut.

23:30.809 --> 23:33.403
I need the gun for protection, Karen.

23:35.013 --> 23:36.071
Gun?

23:36.648 --> 23:39.208
Tell me you didn't shoot out the window.

23:39.284 --> 23:40.911
- With customers?
- Karen...

23:40.986 --> 23:43.216
You could've killed someone
other than your ex-husband.

23:43.288 --> 23:46.655
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- It was an accident.

23:46.725 --> 23:49.751
- Give me the gun.
- I can't.

23:49.828 --> 23:53.127
Deb, I'm not playing games
with your wacky ass.

23:53.198 --> 23:55.393
Give me the damn gun.

24:02.808 --> 24:04.298
Fine.

24:11.483 --> 24:14.316
- Okay, now I get it. How long?
- It's not what you think.

24:14.386 --> 24:16.377
Really? 'Cause you know what I think?

24:16.455 --> 24:19.117
I think you're a recovering addict
who's returned to her former life

24:19.191 --> 24:21.557
of popping pills and brandishing firearms.

24:21.626 --> 24:23.526
I just had a little slip.

24:23.595 --> 24:25.358
- It's not a little slip!
- Oh, come on.

24:25.430 --> 24:27.193
Little slips happen.

24:27.899 --> 24:30.060
But getting wasted
and shooting up the café

24:30.135 --> 24:33.662
during the noon rush is not a little slip!

24:35.340 --> 24:40.403
Deb, you need to get back into rehab.

24:43.582 --> 24:46.574
- Or what?
- Or I will dissolve our partnership.

24:50.055 --> 24:53.786
- Karen...
- No, I will not have a gun-toting junkie

24:53.859 --> 24:56.157
destroy a 17-year-old business.

25:00.732 --> 25:04.668
Fine. You can have your little café.

25:06.538 --> 25:07.732
I quit.

25:15.547 --> 25:16.707
Deb...

25:26.558 --> 25:28.185
It's an Altoid.

25:37.669 --> 25:38.727
Hey.

25:39.771 --> 25:40.965
You okay?

25:41.039 --> 25:43.007
You sounded a little cryptic
when you called.

25:43.074 --> 25:44.439
Yeah. Yeah.

25:46.244 --> 25:50.681
Look, I guess there's no easy way
to do this, so I'm just gonna do it.

25:51.016 --> 25:53.746
I need to know
what happened at the bridge.

25:53.818 --> 25:56.514
Okay, but you saw a lot more than I did.

25:56.588 --> 25:58.317
I'm not sure about that.

26:00.892 --> 26:04.885
Look, I swam into the car
and I got trapped.

26:05.363 --> 26:09.857
I panicked, all right? I didn't save anybody.
As a matter of fact, somebody saved me.

26:13.104 --> 26:16.232
- It was you, wasn't it?
- Oh, Nathan, I wish it was, but it wasn't.

26:16.308 --> 26:19.641
It had to be.
Look, I was trapped in that car, okay?

26:19.711 --> 26:21.303
I ran out of air and my lungs gave out.

26:21.379 --> 26:23.279
Now, unless we're both dead
right now, there's...

26:23.348 --> 26:24.542
Look, Nate, Nate.

26:24.616 --> 26:27.244
Look, people black out all the time
in situations of, like, crisis

26:27.319 --> 26:29.753
or terror or high-stress situations.

26:30.255 --> 26:33.190
You know, it's some kind of
an adrenaline overload.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.249
Okay? But that doesn't mean
that you didn't somehow

26:35.327 --> 26:39.320
pull Cooper and Rachel from that car,
even if you don't remember doing it.

26:40.131 --> 26:43.066
There was no one else there, Nathan.

26:43.468 --> 26:44.992
It was just us.

26:46.638 --> 26:49.198
What if I saw someone in the car?

26:49.274 --> 26:52.334
- You mean Rachel and Cooper?
- No. Someone else.

26:53.511 --> 26:54.773
Who?

27:01.620 --> 27:02.814
Keith.

27:14.799 --> 27:16.767
Well, you've been quiet.

27:18.603 --> 27:21.037
- Getting your game face on?
- No.

27:21.106 --> 27:23.404
Working on your Brooke Davis mojo?

27:25.076 --> 27:26.907
I was thinking about Nathan.

27:27.612 --> 27:30.206
You know, he told me
he saw Keith in the river.

27:30.515 --> 27:33.746
He says he was trapped in the limo
and Keith saved him.

27:35.253 --> 27:37.744
Wow. Keith, huh?

27:39.391 --> 27:42.383
- What did you say?
- Keith's dead, Peyton.

27:46.898 --> 27:49.765
It's unbelievable how much our lives
have changed since freshman year.

27:49.834 --> 27:50.926
Yeah.

27:51.403 --> 27:53.530
It's all gonna end soon, too.

27:54.272 --> 27:55.534
Or begin.

27:58.777 --> 28:00.210
You know, I used to watch you.

28:00.278 --> 28:03.042
- When?
- Well, freshman year.

28:03.548 --> 28:05.516
Sophomore year.

28:05.583 --> 28:07.983
- Both summers, actually.
- Stop it.

28:09.020 --> 28:11.887
- What did you watch?
- Your legs, mostly.

28:11.956 --> 28:14.015
- What?
- No, I'm serious.

28:14.092 --> 28:16.788
You know, from up close
they're a little chickeny...

28:16.861 --> 28:17.953
Shut up!

28:18.029 --> 28:21.055
...but from where I was hiding,
they were pretty awesome.

28:23.401 --> 28:26.837
- I'm not sure that's a compliment.
- Oh, it is. Trust me.

28:29.374 --> 28:32.605
I think it sucks that your brother
hung up on you, Peyton.

28:32.877 --> 28:33.969
Yeah.

28:34.746 --> 28:38.307
I get it, though, you know?
The fear of letting people in.

28:39.284 --> 28:42.981
Getting close to somebody
and then it just not working out.

28:47.726 --> 28:52.686
Anyway, almost time for Brooke.
You ready?

28:53.665 --> 28:55.758
You know, I've been thinking.

28:55.834 --> 28:59.827
Why don't you just go instead?
You know, patch things up with her.

28:59.904 --> 29:02.805
You guys have a lifelong friendship
that's at stake here.

29:02.874 --> 29:06.366
Yeah, but you love her.

29:09.280 --> 29:10.372
I do.

29:12.617 --> 29:15.108
Well, you said it yourself.
You can't help who you love.

29:15.186 --> 29:18.383
So thank you for thinking of me,

29:18.456 --> 29:21.550
but this is my birthday present for Brooke.

29:21.659 --> 29:22.648
You sure?

29:24.863 --> 29:27.297
Yeah. Go ahead. I'll wait.

29:34.239 --> 29:35.570
I'll wait.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.410
You think your mom's a spy?

29:43.548 --> 29:46.676
- Or a pimp, maybe?
- What?

29:46.751 --> 29:48.116
She's got a gun.

29:49.154 --> 29:51.679
- Yeah. She's packing heat.
- What are you talking about?

29:51.756 --> 29:54.224
Your mom brought a gun
into the café today.

29:54.292 --> 29:55.953
Oh, and it went off.

29:56.027 --> 29:59.463
- What? Was anybody hurt?
- No, thank God.

30:00.665 --> 30:02.496
- Unbelievable.
- I know.

30:02.567 --> 30:04.467
- I'll talk to her.
- Now?

30:04.536 --> 30:05.594
No.

30:05.670 --> 30:08.468
Okay, but she's acting really weird
and she's strapped with a nine.

30:08.540 --> 30:09.837
I get it, Hales,

30:09.908 --> 30:12.274
but the playoffs are next week,
and my mom's an adult.

30:12.343 --> 30:14.038
Both my parents are, supposedly.

30:14.112 --> 30:16.512
Well, where are you going, then?

30:16.581 --> 30:17.912
The River Court.

30:17.982 --> 30:20.542
Nathan, your knee's all...
Your mom is totally freaking out!

30:20.618 --> 30:21.846
I'm the kid, Hales,

30:21.920 --> 30:23.615
and I'm sick of dealing
with my parents' problems.

30:23.688 --> 30:26.384
If it's not my dad with a restraining order,
it's my mom with a Glock.

30:26.457 --> 30:27.981
They're unbelievable.

30:28.059 --> 30:29.549
My one saving grace,

30:29.627 --> 30:30.958
my one way out,

30:31.029 --> 30:34.157
is that if I play halfway decent
in these playoffs,

30:34.232 --> 30:38.225
I can get a scholarship and get
the hell away from both of those lunatics.

30:41.873 --> 30:44.068
Should my mom have a gun? No.

30:44.442 --> 30:45.739
But am I gonna let her stupidity

30:45.810 --> 30:48.244
or anything else
stand in the way of my dreams?

30:48.313 --> 30:49.780
Not a chance.

30:51.249 --> 30:52.978
- I'll see you.
- Bye.

31:02.660 --> 31:04.127
Knock, knock.

31:06.164 --> 31:08.462
Dan, you can't keep doing this.

31:08.533 --> 31:09.898
Doing what?

31:12.604 --> 31:14.037
Coming around like this.

31:14.105 --> 31:17.666
Look, I know you said that you intend
on being there for me with this pregnancy,

31:17.742 --> 31:20.108
but the truth is, Dan, you are not that guy.

31:20.178 --> 31:22.203
You were not that guy
the first time with Lucas,

31:22.280 --> 31:24.771
and you're never gonna be that guy.

31:25.350 --> 31:27.215
You have to know that.

31:41.399 --> 31:43.026
That's Lucas' crib.

31:44.602 --> 31:46.593
- Dan, I...
- I did it myself.

31:47.872 --> 31:49.533
I hope you like it.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.499
Okay, I bring you to this club,

32:16.567 --> 32:20.196
I fill your kitschy but hideous
Spice Girl mug with alcohol,

32:20.271 --> 32:22.000
and you haven't touched it.

32:22.073 --> 32:23.472
This how you spend all your birthdays?

32:23.541 --> 32:27.033
Actually, no, I usually spend them
with Peyton, but not this year.

32:27.111 --> 32:28.840
Yeah, what's going on with that anyway?

32:28.913 --> 32:29.971
I mean, I missed a couple things

32:30.048 --> 32:31.709
when I was hanging out
at the bottom of the river.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.341
Peyton likes Lucas.

32:33.885 --> 32:36.012
Did she try to sleep with him?
'Cause I did that, too.

32:36.087 --> 32:37.247
She kissed him.

32:37.322 --> 32:40.723
The day of the school shooting,
she kissed him in the library.

32:43.728 --> 32:47.960
Well, by default, if you're about to die
or at least bleeding to death,

32:48.032 --> 32:51.229
I think you get a free kissing pass.
What else did she do?

32:51.869 --> 32:56.135
Well, she had the nerve to say
she'd back off if I loved him.

32:56.207 --> 32:59.665
Can you believe that? She wanted me
to declare my love for my own boyfriend.

32:59.744 --> 33:01.268
Why didn't you?

33:03.948 --> 33:06.041
Okay. Let me get this straight.

33:06.117 --> 33:07.914
You don't have feelings
for Lucas anymore.

33:07.986 --> 33:12.480
Peyton does, yet she's willing
to hide those feelings if you asked her to?

33:13.491 --> 33:16.085
Sounds like a pretty great friend to me.

33:23.901 --> 33:26.734
Check it out. Your birthday present's here.

33:28.106 --> 33:30.006
Well, at least one of them. You pick.

33:30.074 --> 33:32.008
Isn't it a little soon for you?

33:32.076 --> 33:34.670
I mean, is Cooper's tux even dry yet?

33:35.646 --> 33:37.341
Cooper's gone, Brooke.

33:37.782 --> 33:41.741
So I'm using your birthday as an excuse
to drown my sorrows in alcohol and boy.

33:41.819 --> 33:44.253
Rachel, a one-nighter
is just gonna make it worse.

33:44.322 --> 33:45.880
Tomorrow it'll make it worse.

33:45.957 --> 33:49.120
But tonight, trust me,
it'll make it much better.

33:49.293 --> 33:51.022
So which one do you want?

33:53.197 --> 33:54.425
I can't.

33:55.299 --> 33:57.494
Suit yourself. Don't wait up.

34:07.111 --> 34:09.045
<i>Attention, shoppers. We are now closed.</i>

34:09.112 --> 34:10.239
Come on, Brooke.

34:10.313 --> 34:13.283
<i>Please join us tomorrow morning</i>
<i>from 9:00 a.m. To 9:00 p.m.</i>

34:20.257 --> 34:21.850
I'm sorry, Luke.

34:22.092 --> 34:24.061
I really thought she was gonna show.

34:24.128 --> 34:26.426
But look at it this way.
She didn't know you were gonna be here.

34:26.496 --> 34:28.965
So there's still hope for the two of you.

34:29.333 --> 34:31.358
Just not so much for me and her.

34:46.016 --> 34:49.646
Here. I stole this for you.

34:55.726 --> 34:57.250
It smells good.

35:12.143 --> 35:13.735
Best birthday ever?

35:17.281 --> 35:18.771
When I was 12.

35:19.951 --> 35:24.354
My mom and Keith surprised me
with tickets to the Duke-Carolina game.

35:24.689 --> 35:27.920
Oh, no, no.
We drove up, made a weekend out of it.

35:27.992 --> 35:31.951
And it was cool because it was
the first time we were ever a real family.

35:33.664 --> 35:36.098
And I'd give anything to have that back.

35:37.835 --> 35:40.929
- You?
- My eighth birthday.

35:41.205 --> 35:45.335
My mom was still alive.
It was the last time we were a real family.

35:47.879 --> 35:50.074
I'd give anything to have that back.

35:55.553 --> 35:57.578
You want me to drive you by Rachel's?

35:57.655 --> 35:59.452
Maybe Brooke's there.

36:00.758 --> 36:04.455
<i>There are moments in our lives</i>
<i>when we find ourselves at a crossroads.</i>

36:05.229 --> 36:07.288
No. It's okay.

36:09.367 --> 36:12.029
Would you drop me by the River Court?

36:12.103 --> 36:14.367
It's where I do my best healing.

36:14.438 --> 36:15.530
Sure.

36:31.088 --> 36:34.990
<i>There are moments in our lives</i>
<i>when we find ourselves at a crossroads.</i>

36:39.297 --> 36:43.700
<i>Afraid. Confused. Without a roadmap.</i>

36:50.408 --> 36:54.640
<i>The choices we make in those moments</i>
<i>can define the rest of our days.</i>

37:12.430 --> 37:14.728
<i>Of course, when faced with the unknown,</i>

37:16.033 --> 37:18.593
<i>most of us prefer to turn around</i>
<i>and go back.</i>

37:21.405 --> 37:23.100
Doing a little scouting?

37:25.576 --> 37:27.601
I'm putting him on the team.

37:28.980 --> 37:30.470
Really?

37:31.549 --> 37:34.313
Oh, that's great, Coach.
What made you decide?

37:35.786 --> 37:37.811
You did.

37:37.888 --> 37:42.985
Not long ago
I found a kid out on that very same court.

37:45.196 --> 37:48.893
If that young man turns out to be
the kind of player and person

37:48.966 --> 37:51.400
that scrawny kid turned out to be,

37:52.870 --> 37:54.531
it's a no-brainer.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.819
You just became a Raven.

38:17.795 --> 38:20.923
<i>But once in a while,</i>
<i>people push on to something better.</i>

38:29.907 --> 38:32.967
<i>Something found just beyond the pain</i>
<i>of going it alone.</i>

38:40.718 --> 38:42.185
Are you Peyton?

38:46.957 --> 38:48.288
I'm Derek.

38:52.930 --> 38:54.659
I guess I'm your brother.

38:55.700 --> 38:59.659
<i>And just beyond the bravery</i>
<i>and courage it takes to let someone in.</i>

39:08.346 --> 39:10.507
<i>Or to give someone a second chance.</i>

39:15.953 --> 39:18.945
<i>Something beyond the quiet persistence</i>
<i>of a dream.</i>

39:29.734 --> 39:32.760
Happy birthday, you boring old shrew.

39:34.672 --> 39:36.606
You said, "Don't wait up."

39:37.074 --> 39:38.974
And you call this late?

39:39.110 --> 39:40.543
I wasn't into it.

39:41.045 --> 39:44.310
The boys in Tree Hill
are so boring compared to Cooper.

39:45.416 --> 39:48.613
Isn't there anybody our age
you think you could fall for?

39:54.992 --> 39:56.152
Maybe.

40:05.970 --> 40:08.495
I found your ball at home.

40:10.107 --> 40:12.098
I was kind of hoping you would.

40:18.983 --> 40:20.974
I need you to talk to me.

40:23.020 --> 40:27.354
Haley, I'm not trying
to shut you out, okay?

40:29.427 --> 40:32.726
I just don't understand it enough
to let you in yet.

40:35.266 --> 40:39.362
Whatever it is,
we're gonna get through it together.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.337
I'm right here, Nathan.

40:42.807 --> 40:44.741
I'm not going anywhere.

40:47.511 --> 40:51.538
<i>Because it's only when you're tested</i>
<i>that you truly discover who you are.</i>

41:02.393 --> 41:06.329
<i>And it's only when you're tested</i>
<i>that you discover who you can be.</i>

41:10.534 --> 41:11.660
Hey.

41:12.403 --> 41:14.337
I'm sorry about your birthday.

41:15.539 --> 41:17.769
Did anything memorable happen?

41:19.643 --> 41:21.008
Yeah. One thing.

41:21.345 --> 41:23.677
<i>The person you want to be does exist,</i>

41:24.215 --> 41:28.584
<i>somewhere on the other side</i>
<i>of hard work and faith and belief</i>

41:33.858 --> 41:38.124
<i>and beyond the heartache</i>
<i>and fear of what lies ahead.</i>
