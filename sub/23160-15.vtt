Alexis.

02:24.314 --> 02:25.679
Where you going?

02:30.787 --> 02:33.278
Excuse me, excuse me.

02:43.933 --> 02:45.764
Alex! Alex!

02:45.835 --> 02:48.235
Hey lady.
Wait, I want to show you something.

02:48.304 --> 02:49.464
Wait a minute.

02:49.539 --> 02:52.064
Wait, mister. Wait a minute.
I have to show...

02:52.142 --> 02:53.939
Get out of the way!

03:10.026 --> 03:12.051
<i>Aha! There you are.</i>

03:13.830 --> 03:15.627
Magnum, I'm speaking to you.

03:16.499 --> 03:17.625
Huh?

03:17.700 --> 03:21.067
Oh! I'm sorry, Higgins.
I was concentrating.

03:23.806 --> 03:26.775
I wonder if you've ever
been exposed to the adage...

03:27.277 --> 03:30.303
"A place for everything
and everything in it's place"?

03:30.480 --> 03:31.879
Of course I have.

03:31.948 --> 03:33.745
You're standing in my light.

03:36.819 --> 03:38.411
This one, here.

03:39.856 --> 03:41.050
There.

03:44.060 --> 03:46.187
I know exactly
where everything is.

03:46.996 --> 03:48.224
I have a system.

03:48.298 --> 03:50.232
Good. Then it shouldn't
take long...

03:50.300 --> 03:51.824
to gather up all the items
you've borrowed...

03:51.901 --> 03:54.461
from Mr. Masters over the year,
and return them to me...

03:54.537 --> 03:57.233
so I can conduct inventory
on schedule tomorrow.

03:57.307 --> 03:58.934
Inventory? Already?

03:59.008 --> 04:00.498
Quit stalling, Magnum.

04:00.577 --> 04:02.204
If you don't know
where the items are...

04:02.278 --> 04:04.405
I do know where they are.

04:06.149 --> 04:08.049
The 40mm F2.0 lens?

04:08.318 --> 04:10.252
Behind the boat, on the mantle.

04:21.297 --> 04:23.959
The 560mm C-70 telescope.

04:24.334 --> 04:27.064
In the cupboard
next to the refrigerator.

04:38.081 --> 04:41.141
Oh, would you get me a beer
while you're there, please?

04:44.420 --> 04:47.685
Mr. Master's portable 4 band
receiver component system...

04:47.757 --> 04:51.921
with cassette deck, micro speakers,
music scan and Dolby sound.

04:53.896 --> 04:55.420
The component system.

04:55.832 --> 04:56.992
You've lost it.

04:57.066 --> 04:59.296
I haven't lost it.
I know exactly where it is.

04:59.369 --> 05:00.427
Where?

05:20.940 --> 05:24.068
Hi, guy. Out kind of early,
aren't you?

05:24.143 --> 05:26.168
Yeah, I'm trying something new.

05:26.245 --> 05:28.008
The honeymoon sunrise tour.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.604
This is my third this week.

05:29.682 --> 05:31.309
Oh, yeah! That's great.

05:31.684 --> 05:34.016
Yeah. You'd be surprised how
much business has picked up...

05:34.086 --> 05:35.815
since I started
using these tapes.

05:35.888 --> 05:38.186
That tape recorder
you sent away for?

05:38.257 --> 05:39.986
Yeah. Four to six weeks
they said.

05:40.059 --> 05:41.549
Hey, listen to this.

05:44.397 --> 05:45.659
So you didn't get it yet?

05:45.731 --> 05:49.189
This is what I've been playing
on the honeymoon sunrise tour.

05:52.405 --> 05:55.306
<i>The glory of the
day was in her face.</i>

05:56.142 --> 05:58.508
<i>The beauty of the night
was in her eyes.</i>

05:59.145 --> 06:02.945
<i>And over all her loveliness,
the grace of morning...</i>

06:03.516 --> 06:05.780
<i>blushing in the early sky.</i>

06:06.953 --> 06:09.114
Well, anyway,
it goes on from there.

06:09.288 --> 06:10.755
That's really nice.

06:11.557 --> 06:13.491
Man, I am telling you...

06:14.594 --> 06:18.086
there is something about
flying over the Koolaus...

06:18.164 --> 06:21.395
when the sun comes up,
listening to this music...

06:22.034 --> 06:24.525
with two people in love sitting
in the chopper with you.

06:24.604 --> 06:26.071
It just makes you feel great.

06:26.138 --> 06:27.935
I have to take
the component system back.

06:28.007 --> 06:30.601
Yeah, I know. As soon as mine comes in.
That's our deal.

06:30.676 --> 06:32.576
I have to take it back today.

06:32.645 --> 06:33.907
Today?

06:34.013 --> 06:37.176
No, you don't.
Not today. Eight weeks.

06:37.350 --> 06:40.649
You said you would loan it to me
for eight weeks to pay me back...

06:40.720 --> 06:43.188
for all the gas money that you owe me.
That's what you said.

06:43.256 --> 06:45.588
Yeah. That's before I found out
I had to have it back today.

06:45.658 --> 06:46.682
No!

06:46.759 --> 06:47.783
T.C.

06:47.860 --> 06:52.058
I'm sorry, I got a tour tomorrow
morning and I need that tape system.

06:52.131 --> 06:54.031
But Robin promised it
to someone else.

06:54.100 --> 06:56.125
It's his, T.C.
What can I do?

06:56.202 --> 06:59.330
What can you do?
I guess there's nothing you can do.

06:59.405 --> 07:01.566
The trouble is, it's bolted
into the chopper...

07:01.641 --> 07:03.199
and it will take me a while
to get it out.

07:03.276 --> 07:04.504
I can wait.

07:04.577 --> 07:07.444
And plus, I got all of this
paperwork to do.

07:09.682 --> 07:11.775
Maybe I could
get it to you tonight.

07:11.851 --> 07:12.875
Great.

07:12.952 --> 07:14.886
When I pick you up to take you
to Chez Jimmy's.

07:14.954 --> 07:16.114
Fine.

07:16.622 --> 07:18.146
Chez Jimmy's?

07:18.958 --> 07:21.256
Oh, I didn't tell you
I got a call from Alexis?

07:21.327 --> 07:22.817
She's here, in town.

07:24.830 --> 07:27.196
She's singing at Chez Jimmy's.

07:27.266 --> 07:28.927
She opens tonight.

07:29.001 --> 07:31.094
I believe this is
where I came in.

07:31.771 --> 07:33.432
No, wait. Wait a minute.

07:34.340 --> 07:36.808
Now aren't you being a
little hard-nosed about this?

07:36.876 --> 07:38.275
No. Not at all.

07:38.344 --> 07:41.245
And what's Alex doing singing
in a place like Chez...

07:41.314 --> 07:44.408
Never mind. Just tell her I
said hello and wish her my best.

07:44.483 --> 07:47.316
Come on, man. I know she's
a pain in the neck sometimes.

07:47.386 --> 07:48.478
Sometimes?

07:48.554 --> 07:50.112
But we did have
some fun together.

07:50.189 --> 07:51.247
Fun?

07:51.324 --> 07:53.815
You call being shot at
in a Saigon bar fun?

07:53.893 --> 07:56.726
You call being thrown in the
stockade for fighting fun?

07:56.796 --> 08:00.926
Look, Thomas, what happened between
me and Alexis was a long time ago.

08:01.701 --> 08:03.669
And I think she's scared
about her opening...

08:03.736 --> 08:06.170
and she could use
some friends there tonight.

08:06.238 --> 08:08.934
Now, I'll pick you up
at 8:00, with the tape.

08:33.065 --> 08:34.395
6:00?

<i>Thank you.
Thank you very much.</i>

13:37.403 --> 13:38.734
We'll just say,
"Hi, how are you...

13:38.804 --> 13:40.863
"great to see you",
then we leave.

13:44.376 --> 13:46.344
I can't believe
you're both here.

13:46.412 --> 13:47.970
Why? It's your
opening night.

13:48.047 --> 13:50.777
I mean, we wouldn't miss that
for anything. Right, T.M.?

13:50.849 --> 13:52.043
Yeah.

13:52.117 --> 13:54.142
You know, I was so scared
you wouldn't show up...

13:54.219 --> 13:56.153
and then I was scared
that you would show up.

13:56.221 --> 13:59.554
I mean, look at me,
singing in a place like this.

13:59.758 --> 14:01.225
You were terrific.

14:01.894 --> 14:02.986
Yeah.

14:03.595 --> 14:05.825
So, hey, lookie here.

14:06.065 --> 14:07.726
How long you gonna be here?

14:07.800 --> 14:09.028
I'm not sure.

14:09.101 --> 14:12.161
Now that's something I wanted
to talk to you guys about.

14:15.107 --> 14:17.940
I've left Denny for good.

14:18.610 --> 14:20.737
And I'm never going back.

14:23.182 --> 14:26.208
But I'm kind of scrapping
to make ends meet.

14:26.719 --> 14:28.277
Oh, hey, you
need some money, l...

14:28.354 --> 14:30.948
Oh, no, no. Well, I do.

14:31.023 --> 14:34.789
But the thing is, there's a guy here
in Hawaii who owes me a lot of money...

14:34.860 --> 14:36.555
and he keeps avoiding me.

14:36.628 --> 14:40.462
So I thought maybe you could help
me figure out how to find him.

14:40.599 --> 14:41.861
Oh. How much does he owe you?

14:41.934 --> 14:43.902
I can give you a little bit
to tide you over.

14:43.969 --> 14:45.402
$18,000.

14:45.537 --> 14:47.004
$18,000?

14:48.474 --> 14:50.374
You loaned someone $18,000?

14:51.210 --> 14:52.677
Sounds like a lot, huh?

14:52.745 --> 14:54.178
Yeah.

14:56.582 --> 14:58.516
Didn't seem so much back then.

14:59.051 --> 15:00.712
The girls and l... God.

15:01.987 --> 15:03.716
Oh, those days...

15:04.390 --> 15:07.257
We thought...
Seemed like we were magic.

15:07.993 --> 15:09.927
Nothing would ever change.

15:11.797 --> 15:15.255
But then little by little everything
just kind of got different.

15:16.935 --> 15:19.335
Do you have an lOU
for this $18,000?

15:19.705 --> 15:21.104
Oh, yeah. Sure.

15:21.173 --> 15:22.435
Hey, see?

15:22.541 --> 15:24.873
We can find him
and give him the lOU.

15:24.943 --> 15:26.342
You'll find him?

15:26.412 --> 15:29.711
Hey, that's great!
His name is David Mitchell.

15:30.983 --> 15:33.611
You know, when I heard you'd
become a private investigator...

15:33.685 --> 15:36.415
I just knew that I could
count on you to help me.

15:36.488 --> 15:39.013
I don't know, Alex, it's...

15:39.525 --> 15:42.358
not always that easy to find someone
who doesn't want to be found.

15:42.428 --> 15:47.331
Unless, you happen to be
very good at that.

15:49.201 --> 15:52.102
I'll tell you what,
to show you how much it means to me...

15:52.171 --> 15:53.661
I'm gonna take you two...

15:53.739 --> 15:55.798
to a night out on the town.
My treat.

15:55.874 --> 15:57.068
Hey.

16:04.216 --> 16:06.275
We're running down the street
and you're yelling...

16:06.351 --> 16:08.444
"Hey, we're going
the wrong way."

16:08.520 --> 16:10.078
It wasn't that funny.

16:10.322 --> 16:13.485
And T.C. yells back, "Yeah,
but we're making great time."

16:13.559 --> 16:17.154
Well,
it wasn't that funny at the time.

16:17.930 --> 16:21.024
Oh, gosh. Nothing is,
you know, nothing is.

16:21.133 --> 16:24.261
I tell you my sides are
hurting from all this laughing.

16:24.870 --> 16:26.838
You know, being with you guys
makes me feel...

16:26.905 --> 16:29.806
that everything is just
possible again, you know.

16:30.142 --> 16:31.370
What?

16:36.849 --> 16:38.407
Oh, my God!

17:15.685 --> 17:17.414
<i>I love you, T.C.</i>

17:17.921 --> 17:19.650
But I can't help it.

17:19.722 --> 17:22.781
That's the way I feel and I'm
not gonna lie to you about it.

17:22.858 --> 17:24.190
Alexis, I...

17:24.327 --> 17:25.954
We can sneak out tomorrow night.

17:26.029 --> 17:28.429
I know this great place
where we can stay.

17:28.498 --> 17:29.897
We won't tell anyone
we're going.

17:31.067 --> 17:33.501
Look, I am not flying you
to Hong Kong.

17:33.903 --> 17:36.599
All right. Where?
You name the place.

17:38.141 --> 17:41.338
I have never met anyone
like you before, ever.

17:41.978 --> 17:42.967
I know.

17:43.279 --> 17:45.474
And I just wish I had
met you a few years ago.

17:45.548 --> 17:46.879
So you met me now.
Yeah.

17:46.950 --> 17:49.817
But I am not running away
with you for the weekend.

17:50.086 --> 17:52.987
I'll respect you afterwards,
I promise.

18:04.734 --> 18:06.531
<i>How was your sunrise tour?</i>

18:07.604 --> 18:08.696
T.C.?

18:09.939 --> 18:12.908
Oh. Spectacular as usual.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.534
Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to wake you up.

18:15.612 --> 18:17.807
I don't even remember
falling asleep.

18:17.947 --> 18:20.211
Hey, you were
pretty tired last night.

18:21.751 --> 18:23.844
T.C.? Thanks.

18:25.288 --> 18:28.155
For getting me through all
the stuff with the police...

18:28.224 --> 18:32.160
and not asking me if I wanted
to talk about it, and I guess...

18:32.395 --> 18:34.260
for not sweeping me off my feet.

18:36.299 --> 18:38.665
Well, the way I figure...

18:38.801 --> 18:41.201
we've got plenty of time
to get to know each other...

18:41.270 --> 18:45.366
without a war to worry about
or other people to account for.

18:47.176 --> 18:48.438
And I'm not going anywhere.

18:48.511 --> 18:51.344
And it looks like you're
gonna be here for a while.

18:51.714 --> 18:52.806
I hope so.

18:54.083 --> 18:56.449
T.C., there's something
you should know.

18:57.620 --> 19:00.646
Denny said if I ever tried
to leave him, he'd kill me.

19:01.391 --> 19:02.790
And I thought...

19:02.859 --> 19:06.317
Well, I didn't see how
he was gonna track me down here.

19:06.863 --> 19:09.354
You think he was the one
that ransacked your room?

19:09.432 --> 19:10.660
I don't know.

19:13.536 --> 19:16.164
Well, if Dennis is around,
that means trouble.

19:16.839 --> 19:17.965
I can take care of myself.

19:18.041 --> 19:21.306
But I can't if I'm worried about
what's gonna happen to you.

19:22.045 --> 19:23.910
So I'm gonna look up
Dave Mitchell...

19:23.980 --> 19:25.675
and in the meantime...

19:26.115 --> 19:28.083
I thought I'd take you
to stay at the one place...

19:28.151 --> 19:29.948
that I know you'll be safe.

19:32.422 --> 19:34.253
Go on, get your clothes on.

19:43.299 --> 19:45.096
<i>She's trouble, T.C.</i>

19:45.301 --> 19:46.563
You've never understood her.

19:46.636 --> 19:48.433
I understand her, I like her.

19:48.504 --> 19:50.938
She's an exciting,
talented, clever woman...

19:51.007 --> 19:52.907
who attracts trouble
like a magnet.

19:52.975 --> 19:54.203
Sounds like a Gemini.

19:54.277 --> 19:55.335
And that's her fault?

19:55.411 --> 19:56.639
I'm not saying it's her fault.

19:56.712 --> 19:58.873
Yes, you are.
Somebody breaks into her hotel room...

19:58.948 --> 20:01.348
looking for money and you say
she brought it all on herself.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.578
That break-in
was no tourist rip-off.

20:03.653 --> 20:05.917
It was a pro job
and you know it, T.C.

20:06.422 --> 20:08.117
Now, someone's looking for Alex.

20:08.191 --> 20:10.216
Like who?
I don't know!

20:10.860 --> 20:14.318
You said she ran away from her husband.
Maybe he wants her back.

20:14.797 --> 20:18.494
All right, it's possible
that Dennis is after her.

20:18.935 --> 20:20.300
I mean, she told me
this morning...

20:20.369 --> 20:22.360
that he said he would kill her
if she ever left him.

20:22.438 --> 20:24.998
But that is all the more
reason why we should help her.

20:25.074 --> 20:28.805
I'm not gonna drop her off on Kalakaua
Avenue somewhere and wish her luck.

20:28.878 --> 20:30.209
I'm not saying you should.

20:30.279 --> 20:32.941
But she's at the estate,
you know she's safe.

20:34.417 --> 20:36.510
I'm just saying that you
should keep your eyes open...

20:36.586 --> 20:38.053
and be careful, that's all.

20:38.120 --> 20:39.553
Hey, you want I should
call lce Pick...

20:39.622 --> 20:40.987
and he'll give him
a two-inch neck?

20:41.057 --> 20:43.582
No. I don't wanna owe
lce Pick any favors.

20:43.659 --> 20:46.093
And I will take care of Dennis
when he shows up...

20:46.162 --> 20:47.186
if he shows up.

20:47.263 --> 20:50.391
But at least Rick can find out if he's
in town. His name is Dennis Johnson.

20:50.466 --> 20:54.061
And while you're at it, see if you can
find out about a guy named David Mitchell.

20:54.136 --> 20:57.503
Dave Mitchell deals mostly in black
market goods and tourist rip-offs.

20:57.573 --> 21:01.339
In fact, he's the kind of guy you
see if you want to sell in quantity.

21:02.612 --> 21:04.079
Well, if he deals
in merchandise...

21:04.146 --> 21:05.875
he must have
a warehouse somewhere.

21:05.948 --> 21:07.006
And salesmen.

21:07.083 --> 21:08.107
Wow, do you believe this?

21:08.184 --> 21:11.950
Here's a guy that they find dead in
a rental car in a sugarcane field...

21:12.021 --> 21:13.989
a hose attached
to his exhaust pipe...

21:14.056 --> 21:15.648
and they're calling it
a suicide.

21:15.725 --> 21:18.956
Rick, do you have any idea
where he lives? Or hangs out?

21:19.028 --> 21:21.189
He harbors a boat
at Leiko Marina.

21:22.164 --> 21:23.859
Good. Good. I'm gonna go
check that out.

21:23.933 --> 21:26.493
While you're at the marina,
I'm gonna go talk to a friend...

21:26.569 --> 21:28.161
traveling salesman.

21:30.907 --> 21:32.966
Hey! Who's paying this check?

21:34.143 --> 21:35.906
<i>Arthur Fiedler</i>
<i>and the Boston</i> P <i>ops.</i>

21:35.978 --> 21:37.275
Check.

21:40.950 --> 21:42.918
Alberta Hunter.

21:43.419 --> 21:45.410
You have the London Session?

21:45.488 --> 21:48.514
I wonder what that's doing
in Mr. Master's collection.

21:48.591 --> 21:50.650
That particular recording
is mine.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.786
You like Alberta Hunter?

21:54.897 --> 21:57.957
I've always followed
her career quite closely...

21:58.034 --> 22:01.492
ever since I saw her perform at
the Dorchester Hotel in London.

22:04.774 --> 22:06.708
Oh, <i>Miss Otis Regrets.</i>

22:07.476 --> 22:09.273
<i>Two Cigarettes In The Dark.</i>

22:09.679 --> 22:10.668
Oh.

22:12.515 --> 22:14.676
In our neighborhood,
when I was growing up...

22:14.750 --> 22:18.117
there was this record store right
on the way home from school.

22:18.287 --> 22:20.255
I'd stop in there
every afternoon...

22:20.323 --> 22:22.257
pretend I was
gonna buy something...

22:22.325 --> 22:26.125
and I'd take Alberta Hunter
albums into their listening room.

22:26.762 --> 22:29.526
I memorized every album,
every song.

22:31.133 --> 22:33.328
I really thought I was
putting one over on them.

22:33.402 --> 22:35.893
Can you see this
skinny little 10-year-old?

22:36.172 --> 22:40.165
"I can't decide between <i>Downhearted
Blues</i> and <i>Bring Back the Joys.</i>"

22:41.978 --> 22:43.912
"I'll just have to come back."

22:44.347 --> 22:47.839
Strutting out that store like I
had two pennies to rub together.

22:49.618 --> 22:51.176
When we had
our first Gold album...

22:51.253 --> 22:53.687
I went back there
to see if they carried it.

22:53.756 --> 22:55.485
But the store wasn't there.

22:55.558 --> 22:57.822
They had turned it
into a parking lot.

22:59.028 --> 23:00.017
Ah.

23:05.334 --> 23:07.268
Well, that's the last of them.

23:08.004 --> 23:12.168
Well, I can't remember when an
inventory has gone by so fast.

23:12.241 --> 23:13.230
We're done?

23:13.309 --> 23:15.675
Yes. I just have a little
packing and storing to do.

23:15.745 --> 23:16.734
Oh, I'll help.

23:16.812 --> 23:17.836
Would you like some tea?

23:17.913 --> 23:19.608
I'd love some tea.

23:20.449 --> 23:23.646
I must say, you're not at all
like Magnum's other friends.

23:23.719 --> 23:26.517
Well, if you talk to Thomas
he'll probably tell you...

23:26.589 --> 23:28.386
I'm not one of his friends.

23:28.791 --> 23:30.258
That explains it.

23:30.926 --> 23:33.793
They seem continually to
look for ways to shirk duty.

23:34.263 --> 23:36.959
Here you are helping out and it's
not even your responsibility.

23:37.033 --> 23:39.024
Well, it's kind of fun.

23:39.602 --> 23:42.901
Besides, you're doing me a big
favor by letting me stay here.

23:43.105 --> 23:45.596
T.C. seemed to think
it was very important.

23:46.642 --> 23:49.440
He thinks there's some big,
bad people out there.

24:04.593 --> 24:05.958
Something wrong?

24:07.229 --> 24:08.321
No.

24:13.969 --> 24:15.231
Thanks.

24:16.705 --> 24:19.833
Oh, come on, Magnum,
you know I'm strictly legit.

24:20.542 --> 24:23.033
You know that and I know that...

24:23.112 --> 24:25.205
but does the IRS know that?

24:25.914 --> 24:28.075
So maybe I don't account
for every penny.

24:28.150 --> 24:30.050
A guy's got to make a living.

24:30.452 --> 24:31.976
You gonna turn me in?

24:32.054 --> 24:34.648
Oh, come on, who said anything
about turning anybody in?

24:34.723 --> 24:36.657
It's just
a friendly conversation.

24:36.725 --> 24:39.421
I don't have anything to do
with Dave Mitchell.

24:39.595 --> 24:40.823
Honest.

24:41.163 --> 24:43.256
Yeah. But you hear things.

24:44.833 --> 24:45.891
Okay.

24:47.136 --> 24:50.401
Last I heard he was operating
out of a storefront on Piikoi.

24:50.472 --> 24:51.939
A gift store, like.

24:52.241 --> 24:55.301
Called something like
King or Majesty or something.

24:55.544 --> 24:57.774
Great. Thanks, Kika.

24:58.747 --> 25:00.214
Hey, here.

25:01.116 --> 25:03.277
It's two tickets to the
Rainbow game Saturday night.

25:03.352 --> 25:04.944
Gee, thanks, bro.

25:07.856 --> 25:10.051
That was a couple of weeks ago.

25:10.359 --> 25:12.452
He might not
still be there, even.

25:21.236 --> 25:22.965
How much to Chez Jimmy's?

25:23.806 --> 25:26.639
I don't know, it's a long way.

25:26.875 --> 25:28.365
$20 cover it?

26:03.178 --> 26:06.238
Hey, you turn it over to us
and we'll let you walk home.

26:06.315 --> 26:07.907
I think you've got
the wrong guy...

26:07.983 --> 26:08.972
if you're looking for Mitchell.

26:09.051 --> 26:11.246
You wanna tell us you're not
working for that girl singer?

26:11.320 --> 26:13.447
Don't you mean your boss' wife?

26:13.522 --> 26:16.116
You'd have done better
staying out of her business.

26:16.191 --> 26:17.852
You got some talking to do, pal.

26:38.914 --> 26:40.279
Hold it, Magnum!

26:46.355 --> 26:48.380
Hey, just let the kid go.

26:48.791 --> 26:50.452
Just let the kid go.

26:56.231 --> 26:57.425
Those friends of yours?

26:57.499 --> 26:59.296
They were looking for Alex.

27:07.190 --> 27:09.317
<i>Alex Carter had a
way of making you think...</i>

27:09.392 --> 27:12.122
<i>walking through fire for her
was your idea.</i>

27:12.195 --> 27:14.425
<i>I believe the technical name
for it is...</i>

27:14.497 --> 27:16.556
<i>"Knight In Shining Armor
Syndrome."</i>

27:16.633 --> 27:19.602
<i>Whatever it was, I hoped
there was an antidote for it.</i>

27:19.669 --> 27:21.933
Hey, Keoki, seen Rick?

27:22.105 --> 27:25.768
He said he was gonna go take a steam
but he's been gone three hours.

27:27.744 --> 27:28.733
Hi, Thomas.

27:28.812 --> 27:30.746
Hey.
Where's T.C.?

27:30.814 --> 27:32.679
Oh, he went to the estate
to check on Alex.

27:32.749 --> 27:33.773
Thanks.

27:33.850 --> 27:35.374
A couple of guys jumped us.

27:35.452 --> 27:38.319
See if you can find out
who this is registered to.

27:39.623 --> 27:41.113
No. I can't.

27:41.658 --> 27:43.683
Hey, Thomas, that's what
the police are for.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.352
Yeah, but you can
make some phone calls.

27:45.428 --> 27:46.725
To who?

27:46.796 --> 27:47.956
I don't know.

27:48.031 --> 27:50.192
You've probably got
connections in Washington.

27:50.266 --> 27:53.633
So do the police. They have procedure,
forms. They have everything.

27:53.703 --> 27:55.796
I can't go to
the police until I find out...

27:55.872 --> 27:57.897
if these guys who jumped us
are connected with Johnson.

27:57.974 --> 27:59.635
I don't want them
slipping out of Hawaii...

27:59.709 --> 28:01.734
while we're tied up
with procedures.

28:01.811 --> 28:04.837
He won't. I just found out
that he never left Detroit.

28:05.181 --> 28:06.842
Dennis Johnson is dead.

28:10.754 --> 28:13.882
Magnum, T.C. said to tell you
something's wrong.

28:14.391 --> 28:15.983
Alex isn't at the estate.

28:16.059 --> 28:18.254
He's on his way over
to Chez Jimmy's.

28:18.628 --> 28:19.890
Thanks, Keoki.

28:20.330 --> 28:22.525
See what you can
find about that gun.

28:46.379 --> 28:48.472
It's all right.
I'm a private eye.

28:55.081 --> 28:56.878
Do you believe this?

28:59.719 --> 29:01.516
What's going on, Alex?

29:02.121 --> 29:04.419
Police called me,
told me to come over.

29:06.059 --> 29:07.924
Who could be doing this?

29:07.994 --> 29:09.325
You tell me.

29:10.964 --> 29:12.488
Well, I'm not sure.

29:15.802 --> 29:18.100
Why don't you start
with what you know?

29:19.672 --> 29:21.731
I have told you what I know.

29:22.342 --> 29:24.367
Want me to tell you
what I guess?

29:24.510 --> 29:26.808
I guess maybe it's Dennis.

29:27.680 --> 29:28.908
It...

29:29.883 --> 29:30.975
It isn't Dennis.

29:31.050 --> 29:32.517
But I guess a lot of things.

29:32.585 --> 29:34.849
I guess you don't
like me too much.

29:34.921 --> 29:37.389
I guess you want me
to stay away from T.C.

29:38.358 --> 29:39.950
I like you just fine, Alex.

29:40.026 --> 29:42.119
I just don't wanna
see him getting hurt.

29:42.195 --> 29:43.287
Or killed.

29:43.363 --> 29:44.796
Because he's with me?

29:44.864 --> 29:46.195
Well, look around you.

29:46.266 --> 29:47.961
Look around you, Alex!

29:48.301 --> 29:50.064
Trouble follows you
everywhere you go.

29:50.136 --> 29:51.398
So what if it does?

29:51.471 --> 29:53.234
If you don't like it, go away.

29:53.306 --> 29:54.898
What T.C. does
is up to him.

29:54.974 --> 29:56.066
He's my friend!

29:56.142 --> 29:58.474
I'm not gonna see you put him
in the middle of something.

29:58.544 --> 30:00.239
That's my business, man.

30:00.313 --> 30:02.577
I don't need you
to take care of me.

30:02.649 --> 30:04.378
And I can handle Johnson.

30:04.450 --> 30:06.714
Dennis Johnson is dead.

30:09.856 --> 30:11.255
Oh, no.

30:12.558 --> 30:13.786
No!

30:17.697 --> 30:18.925
I'm sorry.

30:43.256 --> 30:44.245
Magnum?

30:47.760 --> 30:49.853
What are you doing
sitting here in the dark?

30:49.929 --> 30:52.227
If you're here about Robin's
component system, Higgins...

30:52.298 --> 30:54.323
As a matter of fact, I am.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.594
I don't have it.

30:55.668 --> 30:57.568
And I don't know when I will.

31:00.239 --> 31:04.300
What exotic case could possibly
be worth ruining your eyesight?

31:07.680 --> 31:09.170
It's not even a case.

31:10.717 --> 31:11.877
It's a...

31:13.619 --> 31:15.018
It's a long story.

31:16.723 --> 31:18.190
Boy meets girl?

31:18.391 --> 31:19.881
Something like that.

31:20.560 --> 31:22.425
Classical in its origins.

31:25.064 --> 31:26.861
How does this one begin?

31:31.104 --> 31:32.366
In a war zone.

31:33.306 --> 31:35.297
When I was in 'Nam,
I had a friend.

31:35.375 --> 31:38.310
He was away from home
really for the first time.

31:38.911 --> 31:42.108
His whole world was
turned upside down.

31:43.216 --> 31:46.913
He tried to hold on to all the
things that he really believed in.

31:48.521 --> 31:50.045
Enter the girl.

31:52.225 --> 31:53.590
Oh, she...

31:56.662 --> 31:58.630
She was more than just a girl.

31:59.966 --> 32:03.402
She was a whole new way of life
that he'd never even considered.

32:04.670 --> 32:07.730
She was excitement,
she was danger.

32:07.807 --> 32:09.934
She was the big brass ring.

32:12.512 --> 32:14.377
But he was married, see.

32:14.447 --> 32:16.244
So he had to make a choice.

32:16.783 --> 32:20.742
I didn't know.
What choice did he make?

32:21.487 --> 32:23.216
Which one would you make?

32:23.790 --> 32:25.724
The honorable one, I hope.

32:26.292 --> 32:29.591
To remain true to my vows no
matter how great the temptation.

32:30.229 --> 32:32.629
Yeah. That's the one
he made, too.

32:34.567 --> 32:35.761
But the...

32:38.337 --> 32:40.271
the girl,
she couldn't accept it.

32:40.339 --> 32:43.069
She went into
this self-destruct mode.

32:44.077 --> 32:47.513
By the time she finished
acting out the woman scorned...

32:48.014 --> 32:49.606
she'd hurt everybody.

32:50.249 --> 32:51.841
Especially my friend.

32:52.618 --> 32:56.213
And some years later,
you're afraid...

32:56.556 --> 32:59.354
this young man is about to
make the same mistake.

32:59.926 --> 33:00.984
Yeah.

33:01.060 --> 33:03.324
Of course, he doesn't
see it that way.

33:05.598 --> 33:07.065
Tell me something, Higgins.

33:07.133 --> 33:10.068
If you have a friend and
you think he's in trouble...

33:12.905 --> 33:15.965
and he tells you to walk away from it,
how do you do it?

33:18.077 --> 33:19.442
You don't.

33:24.984 --> 33:26.918
<i>T.C., where are we going?</i>

33:26.986 --> 33:30.012
<i>To see the sun
come up over</i> P <i>aradise.</i>

33:32.592 --> 33:35.686
<i>And usually this is where
the music and the poem begin.</i>

33:36.162 --> 33:37.220
<i>What poem?</i>

33:37.296 --> 33:40.732
<i>It's just something I read,
and put it to music.</i>

33:40.800 --> 33:43.394
<i>Yeah. Come on,
I wanna hear the poem.</i>

33:43.836 --> 33:47.363
<i>Oh, come on, I don't have a voice like
James Earl Jones or nothing. I can't.</i>

33:47.440 --> 33:49.908
<i>Come on.
I wanna hear the poem.</i>

33:51.410 --> 33:52.399
<i>Okay.</i>

33:54.947 --> 33:57.472
<i>The glory of the day
was in her face.</i>

33:58.417 --> 34:00.783
<i>The beauty of the night
was in her eyes.</i>

34:01.020 --> 34:04.581
<i>And over all her loveliness,
the grace of morning...</i>

34:05.458 --> 34:07.926
<i>blushing in the early sky.</i>

34:11.496 --> 34:13.226
<i>T.C., that was beautiful.</i>

34:26.045 --> 34:28.036
Alex?

34:53.121 --> 34:54.679
Charts.

34:54.857 --> 34:57.087
Those are the charts
I left for Alex.

35:05.701 --> 35:07.999
She know you're snooping
around her dressing room?

35:08.070 --> 35:09.094
No.

35:16.078 --> 35:18.376
Look, Mr. Norlan. l...

35:27.523 --> 35:30.458
I don't know what the two of you
were fighting about yesterday.

35:30.526 --> 35:32.517
It's really none of my business.

35:32.895 --> 35:35.557
But I think that lady's had
more than her share of trouble.

35:35.631 --> 35:39.499
As long as I'm around,
I'm gonna make sure nobody bothers her.

35:39.769 --> 35:43.136
Great. Well, maybe you'd better
explain that to the guys who did this.

35:43.205 --> 35:45.901
That is if you see them
before they get to her.

35:56.719 --> 35:59.517
She tell you about
the guy she was seeing?

36:03.325 --> 36:04.383
No.

36:05.327 --> 36:07.227
Well, maybe seeing isn't right.

36:07.296 --> 36:08.524
I don't know.

36:08.731 --> 36:11.097
It's really
none of my business...

36:11.167 --> 36:13.533
but when she first got here
there was this kid Henry...

36:13.602 --> 36:15.069
hanging around
her dressing room.

36:15.137 --> 36:16.502
Who is he?

36:16.972 --> 36:19.668
Kind of a hustler,
pedi-cab driver.

36:21.510 --> 36:24.104
Then a couple of days
before she opened...

36:24.180 --> 36:25.647
he quit coming around.

36:25.714 --> 36:28.274
I didn't think
any more of it till yesterday.

36:29.051 --> 36:30.951
Then I hear he's dead.

36:31.554 --> 36:33.784
She never mentioned him to you?

36:33.889 --> 36:34.947
No.

36:36.058 --> 36:37.923
You have a last name?

36:40.896 --> 36:42.454
How did he die?

36:42.531 --> 36:44.522
Suicide, they said.

36:46.669 --> 36:48.534
They found him
in a sugarcane field?

36:48.604 --> 36:50.572
Yeah. You heard about it.

36:50.639 --> 36:51.765
Yeah.

36:51.841 --> 36:53.138
Thanks.

37:25.708 --> 37:27.471
I got my fares posted, Magnum.

37:27.543 --> 37:29.010
Every penny's accounted for.

37:29.078 --> 37:31.706
I don't wanna talk
about fares, Kika.

37:31.780 --> 37:33.509
You sent me down
a blind alley, didn't you?

37:33.582 --> 37:36.881
Oh, man, if Mitchell even
sees me talking to you...

37:37.019 --> 37:39.783
You think I want to happen
to me what happened to Henry?

37:39.855 --> 37:41.652
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

37:41.724 --> 37:43.885
I just want to know
what's going on.

37:44.159 --> 37:45.148
I don't know.

37:45.227 --> 37:46.819
I think you do.

37:47.629 --> 37:49.688
All I know is you're
in the middle of something...

37:49.765 --> 37:51.494
everybody's nervous about.

37:52.067 --> 37:54.763
Last time I talked to you,
some man gets into my cab...

37:54.837 --> 37:56.600
wants to know all about you.

37:56.672 --> 37:58.037
One of Mitchell's guys?

37:58.107 --> 37:59.597
No. Black dude.

37:59.675 --> 38:01.165
Mainlander, I think.

38:02.010 --> 38:04.274
You better just
close your eyes and walk away.

38:04.346 --> 38:05.904
I can't do that.

38:05.981 --> 38:08.950
I've got a friend who could be in
trouble unless you help me out.

38:09.017 --> 38:10.848
I don't want him to end up
like Henry, either.

38:10.919 --> 38:14.047
Come on, Kika. A name,
a place, anything.

38:14.857 --> 38:16.552
His company's
called Empress lmports.

38:16.625 --> 38:17.990
Nobody's there!

38:18.627 --> 38:21.255
You knew that
when you sent me there.

38:22.131 --> 38:23.564
There's a warehouse...

38:24.533 --> 38:26.160
<i>on South Street.</i>

38:57.733 --> 38:59.598
Hold it right there.

38:59.735 --> 39:01.134
What do you want?

39:03.305 --> 39:04.772
Dave Mitchell.

39:05.607 --> 39:07.006
He's not here.

39:07.075 --> 39:09.339
It's all right, Frank.

39:16.618 --> 39:18.882
You people,
you don't give up, do you?

39:20.088 --> 39:23.023
Now look, I've got a nice
little business going here...

39:23.091 --> 39:24.991
and I'm not looking to expand.

39:25.427 --> 39:28.760
Now I tried to explain that to Henry,
but he wouldn't listen.

39:29.364 --> 39:31.195
What's your connection to Alex?

39:31.266 --> 39:32.631
Connection?

39:32.701 --> 39:34.726
Hey, I never met the girl
in my life.

39:34.803 --> 39:38.569
No, see, she came to see Henry
then Henry came to see me.

39:39.208 --> 39:41.938
Then some guys show up from
Detroit and say that the stuff...

39:42.010 --> 39:44.570
that she's trying to sell
belongs to them.

39:44.646 --> 39:47.410
Now, I told Henry to look
for another buyer.

39:47.482 --> 39:50.007
Now me, I don't like drugs.

39:50.085 --> 39:53.486
And I don't like wars.
People get hurt.

39:53.856 --> 39:56.188
But Henry, he got ambitious.

39:56.391 --> 40:00.225
So these guys from Detroit they
took him out to a sugarcane field.

40:01.496 --> 40:03.225
Now between you and me...

40:03.298 --> 40:06.631
I think they've got the same
trip in mind for the singer.

40:15.325 --> 40:16.883
<i>Did he say where he was going?</i>

40:18.295 --> 40:21.856
I know you're not his answering
service, Higgins, but he's not...

40:22.165 --> 40:23.564
He's not... Hey...

40:23.967 --> 40:27.334
Never mind, Higgins, never mind,
he just walked in. Thank you.

40:27.771 --> 40:29.500
Thomas, I traced the gun.
Made a couple of calls.

40:29.572 --> 40:32.097
It wasn't that hard. I even had
to disguise my voice a few times.

40:32.175 --> 40:33.199
Have you seen T.C.?

40:33.276 --> 40:35.039
Not this morning.
But I got through to Washington...

40:35.111 --> 40:36.373
and I got through
to the manufacturer.

40:36.446 --> 40:37.936
I called his office,
I called his house.

40:38.014 --> 40:40.312
Do you know I actually talked
to the legal owner of the gun?

40:40.383 --> 40:42.214
He told me that the gun
was stolen a week ago.

40:42.285 --> 40:43.775
And guess what else I found out?

40:43.853 --> 40:45.878
How Dennis Johnson died.

40:45.956 --> 40:48.481
Suicide. Rental car.
In a junk yard...

40:49.192 --> 40:50.625
How did you know that?

40:50.694 --> 40:54.790
You what I can't figure out is how
a small time hood from Detroit...

40:54.864 --> 40:57.230
hooked up with a small
time dealer from Honolulu.

40:57.300 --> 40:58.995
Alex.
Huh?

40:59.069 --> 41:00.696
Hey, wait.
Where're you going?

41:00.770 --> 41:01.759
T.C.'s office.

41:01.838 --> 41:03.567
Well, I'm going with you.

41:24.227 --> 41:25.216
Wow!

41:33.636 --> 41:34.728
Who you calling?

41:34.804 --> 41:36.567
Flight lnformation Center.

41:39.676 --> 41:42.509
Yes, I'm checking
on the whereabouts of...

41:42.612 --> 41:47.140
an lsland Hoppers
Hughes 500-D Niner-5 Alpha.

41:49.786 --> 41:52.346
Do you have any idea
when he's coming back?

41:53.156 --> 41:54.487
Thank you.

41:54.724 --> 41:57.716
Look, they said he called in
at 4:45 this morning.

41:57.794 --> 41:59.659
One passenger.

41:59.729 --> 42:01.924
No specific flight plan.

42:03.099 --> 42:05.033
That means they're still
on this lsland somewhere.

42:05.101 --> 42:06.693
If he took his regular flight...

42:06.770 --> 42:10.069
these brochures are gonna lead
whoever did this right to him.

42:23.019 --> 42:24.043
No!

42:24.120 --> 42:26.486
Hey! You're all right.
You're all right.

42:26.689 --> 42:28.680
I just had a bad dream.

42:31.361 --> 42:32.419
T.C.

42:32.495 --> 42:33.962
Yeah?

42:34.864 --> 42:36.695
I've done something terrible.

42:36.766 --> 42:39.701
No. You're here with me.

42:43.473 --> 42:45.600
If you knew what it was like...

42:46.543 --> 42:48.773
I thought it was all worth it.

42:50.413 --> 42:53.712
At first, it seemed okay
and the money was there...

42:55.385 --> 42:58.946
but everything started falling
apart and I couldn't sing and l...

42:59.456 --> 43:01.083
Oh, God. Denny.

43:02.058 --> 43:04.219
He started getting desperate
when the money ran out.

43:05.562 --> 43:07.052
Just calm down.

43:07.130 --> 43:08.859
And now he's dead.

43:08.932 --> 43:11.526
But I tried, T.C.
I lost everything.

43:11.968 --> 43:14.869
Come on, now, it's over.
It's all over.

43:15.505 --> 43:17.063
No, it isn't.

43:19.642 --> 43:22.440
If I had stayed there,
I would have died.

43:23.546 --> 43:25.707
I couldn't see any way out.

43:28.418 --> 43:33.048
And then, I overheard Denny
tell someone about a drop.

43:35.225 --> 43:37.250
And I knew it was
my only chance.

43:45.101 --> 43:47.001
I packed a suitcase...

43:48.505 --> 43:50.439
went to the drop...

43:50.507 --> 43:52.475
found two kilos of cocaine...

43:55.378 --> 43:57.471
and I took them.

44:00.984 --> 44:02.383
T.C., please.

44:03.820 --> 44:05.219
Who's Mitchell?

44:05.288 --> 44:06.585
A buyer.

44:07.090 --> 44:09.888
You used me and Thomas
to find you a dope dealer?

44:09.993 --> 44:13.190
I didn't know what else to do!
Please try to see!

44:13.263 --> 44:15.060
You didn't know
what they would do to Dennis?

44:15.131 --> 44:17.691
It was a chance I had to take.
He was killing me!

44:17.767 --> 44:18.927
Drugs.

44:19.202 --> 44:21.102
The one thing you knew
I wouldn't stand for.

44:21.171 --> 44:22.570
I'll give it back!

44:23.206 --> 44:24.867
It doesn't work
that way, Alexis.

44:24.941 --> 44:26.636
I didn't mean for you
to get hurt.

44:26.709 --> 44:28.074
What did you think would happen?

44:28.144 --> 44:30.044
I didn't think! I only hoped!

44:30.446 --> 44:32.311
Yeah. Well, so did l.

44:37.320 --> 44:38.412
T.C.

44:45.361 --> 44:46.350
T.C.?

44:46.729 --> 44:49.163
Nobody ever drives
up here anymore.

44:49.666 --> 44:51.463
Come on.
Get in the chopper.

45:00.543 --> 45:02.408
Come on! Get in the chopper!

45:11.270 --> 45:12.567
Hold it.

45:12.705 --> 45:14.536
All right, shut it off, cowboy.

45:14.607 --> 45:16.336
Come on. Come on, move it!

45:22.682 --> 45:25.651
Always in a hurry, huh, Alexis?

45:26.853 --> 45:29.378
I had a talk with Dennis
before I left town.

45:29.489 --> 45:32.322
He tells me you have something
that belongs to me.

45:32.892 --> 45:35.360
And I don't plan to
leave town without it.

45:35.728 --> 45:37.059
You can have it.

45:37.130 --> 45:38.563
What was that?
I didn't hear you.

45:38.631 --> 45:41.327
Hey, man,
why don't you quit playing... T.C., no.

45:43.336 --> 45:44.530
Here.

45:48.474 --> 45:49.907
In here there's a key
to a locker...

45:49.976 --> 45:52.103
and I'll take you there,
but alone.

45:52.645 --> 45:54.010
Alexis.

45:54.580 --> 45:55.945
Take care of him.

45:56.649 --> 45:58.241
You do anything to him...

45:58.317 --> 46:00.547
and you'll never find
that locker.

46:03.055 --> 46:04.181
Yeah.

46:09.629 --> 46:11.426
Let's get out of here!

46:19.739 --> 46:20.797
You okay?

46:20.873 --> 46:22.101
Yeah. Always.

46:46.299 --> 46:49.029
No! You'll kill him!

46:49.669 --> 46:50.931
Alex, don't!
