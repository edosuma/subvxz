00:16.552 --> 00:19.187
I guess now is the
time where I ask...

00:19.189 --> 00:19.921
What are you doing?

00:19.923 --> 00:21.790
Practicing my parade wave.

00:21.792 --> 00:24.593
Since Dez is a cheerleader,
he's gonna be on their float

00:24.595 --> 00:25.660
in the homecoming parade.

00:25.662 --> 00:28.263
So what's the theme of the
cheerleader float this year?

00:28.265 --> 00:29.631
Funny you should ask.

00:29.633 --> 00:31.199
I'm the one building it.

00:31.201 --> 00:33.635
The theme is gonna
be "the ocean world

00:33.637 --> 00:38.240
or habitat, if you will... of our mascot,
the majestic Marino High manatee,

00:38.242 --> 00:41.376
sometimes referred
to as the sea cow."

00:43.913 --> 00:45.981
Ally, I have some big news.

00:45.983 --> 00:48.450
I just got off the phone
with Ronnie Ramone.

00:48.452 --> 00:50.986
He wants you to write a
song with Gavin Young.

00:50.988 --> 00:52.988
Gavin Young, that hot
new country singer?

00:52.990 --> 00:55.257
No, Gavin Young, that hot new...

00:55.259 --> 00:56.658
I'm gonna try to steal
him as a client,

00:56.660 --> 00:58.693
country singer.

00:58.695 --> 01:00.896
I don't know. I'm not sure
if I want to work with him.

01:00.898 --> 01:03.398
- Why not?
- I'd be doing all the work.

01:03.400 --> 01:05.934
He's just some pretty boy who
probably knows nothing about music.

01:05.936 --> 01:07.636
You don't know that.

01:07.638 --> 01:09.371
We happen to know a
guy who's proven

01:09.373 --> 01:11.573
that being pretty doesn't
mean you're not talented.

01:11.575 --> 01:13.942
Thank you, Trish.

01:13.944 --> 01:15.944
I was talking about Austin.

01:15.946 --> 01:17.846
- Oh.
- Thanks.

01:17.848 --> 01:18.914
And Trish is right.

01:18.916 --> 01:19.981
I think you should
work with Gavin.

01:19.983 --> 01:23.251
Really? You don't mind me
writing with someone else?

01:23.253 --> 01:24.920
No. It's only one song.

01:24.922 --> 01:26.555
And it'd be good
for your career.

01:26.557 --> 01:27.956
You're right.

01:27.958 --> 01:29.825
Okay, Trish. Tell
Ronnie I'll do it.

01:29.827 --> 01:30.959
Great, I'll call him.

01:30.961 --> 01:34.429
While you do that, I'm gonna
practice my parade wave.

01:35.277 --> 01:36.598
Oh, are you working
on yours too?

01:36.600 --> 01:37.933
No, I just want you to leave.

01:37.935 --> 01:39.267
Bye-bye.

02:36.058 --> 02:37.926
Hey.

02:37.928 --> 02:39.461
You want to work on a new song?

02:39.463 --> 02:44.065
I can't. I have that meeting I have
a feeling I'll be writing his songs

02:44.067 --> 02:46.701
while he just sits there
styling his hair.

02:46.703 --> 02:49.070
How does he get it like that?

02:49.072 --> 02:50.939
He uses a texture cream.

02:50.941 --> 02:53.708
It's healthy for your
roots and has great hold.

02:57.413 --> 02:59.181
I mean, that's just a guess.

03:00.550 --> 03:03.852
Everyone, I'd like you
to meet Gavin Young.

03:03.854 --> 03:07.389
Gavin, meet Austin and Ally, my
two most successful clients.

03:07.391 --> 03:08.757
We're your only clients.

03:08.759 --> 03:10.125
Shh!

03:10.127 --> 03:11.726
It's nice to meet you, Ally.

03:11.728 --> 03:12.994
I'm sorry I'm late.

03:12.996 --> 03:17.832
I came across a sign for a lost basset
hound and I couldn't not look for it.

03:17.834 --> 03:19.100
Aww.

03:19.102 --> 03:20.869
And then when I finally
found Barnaby,

03:20.871 --> 03:23.471
I couldn't return him without
giving him a bath first.

03:23.473 --> 03:25.974
And then I brushed his teeth
and bought him a new chew toy,

03:25.976 --> 03:28.510
and well, y'all
know how that goes.

03:28.512 --> 03:30.979
Yeah, I helped a
hurt squirrel once.

03:30.981 --> 03:33.682
Then it bit me and I had to
get a dozen rabies shots.

03:34.684 --> 03:36.818
Stupid squirrels.

03:36.820 --> 03:38.086
Anyway, great to meet you.

03:39.088 --> 03:41.423
Uh... Texture cream?

03:41.425 --> 03:42.824
Yeah, I can't believe
you noticed.

03:42.826 --> 03:44.092
I noticed that about you
when I saw the magazine.

03:44.094 --> 03:45.560
Okay, guys!

03:45.562 --> 03:47.896
Ally and Gavin have
to get to work.

03:47.898 --> 03:49.965
See, that's the kind
of manager I am.

03:49.967 --> 03:51.900
Sign with me and I'll
keep you focused.

03:51.902 --> 03:54.669
Uh, thanks, but I already
have a great manager.

03:54.671 --> 03:57.005
And it'd just break his
little heart if I left him.

03:57.007 --> 04:01.042
Ugh, do you really want to be repped
by a sensitive crybaby like that?

04:01.978 --> 04:03.144
Okay, Gavin.

04:03.146 --> 04:07.048
Songwriting can be complicated,
so I'll keep it simple for you.

04:08.084 --> 04:11.753
What's with all them black dots
and lines and stuff up there?

04:11.755 --> 04:13.888
Oh boy, it's worse
than I thought.

04:14.958 --> 04:17.892
I know that's a major
pentatonic scale.

04:17.894 --> 04:19.761
I've been studying music
theory since I was three.

04:19.762 --> 04:21.829
Okay, wow.

04:21.832 --> 04:23.832
Then this is gonna be fun.

04:23.834 --> 04:27.836
I've never written with anybody who
knows as much about music as I do.

04:27.838 --> 04:30.472
What about me?

04:30.474 --> 04:32.507
You okay, Austin?

04:32.509 --> 04:34.643
You ought to get that
cough checked out.

04:39.882 --> 04:42.117
Kimmy, you're gonna
love my float design.

04:42.119 --> 04:45.954
It's called "the ocean world
or habitat, if you will,

04:45.956 --> 04:51.960
the majestic Marino high manatee,
sometimes referred to as the sea cow."

04:54.130 --> 04:57.666
Wow, that's a long title,
but I love the float!

04:57.668 --> 04:59.734
Yes! I'll start building it.

05:00.970 --> 05:02.570
Not so fast, red.

05:03.839 --> 05:05.507
What are you doing here, Chuck?

05:05.509 --> 05:09.878
I've got some... Float
designs of my own.

05:11.981 --> 05:14.516
Bunnies, really?

05:14.518 --> 05:16.518
Wrong page.

05:16.520 --> 05:18.520
I just like drawing bunnies.

05:19.555 --> 05:23.158
Since homecoming revolves around football,
my float's gonna have a quarterback

05:23.160 --> 05:26.494
that hurls footballs as
far as the eye can see.

05:26.496 --> 05:27.829
Ooh, I like that.

05:27.831 --> 05:31.666
A football themed float is perfect since
homecoming revolves around football.

05:31.668 --> 05:34.135
Yeah, that's literally
what I just said.

05:35.805 --> 05:38.239
But Kimmy, I thought
we decided on doing

05:38.241 --> 05:39.974
"the ocean world or
habitat, if you will,

05:39.976 --> 05:41.976
of our mascot, the majestic
Marino high manatee,

05:41.978 --> 05:44.979
sometimes referred
to as the sea cow"!

05:44.981 --> 05:48.149
I don't care what you two do,
as long as we win best float.

05:51.120 --> 05:53.121
Well, let's get started
on my manatee float.

05:53.123 --> 05:54.589
It's clearly the winner.

05:54.591 --> 05:55.957
I don't think so.

05:55.959 --> 05:59.027
My float's such a winner,
when people win the lottery,

05:59.029 --> 06:03.732
they'll say "Congratulations, you
are the lucky Chuck's float."

06:03.734 --> 06:04.966
Oh yeah?

06:04.968 --> 06:08.103
My float's such a winner, it'll
win the Oscar for best picture,

06:08.105 --> 06:09.838
best supporting actress, and...

06:09.840 --> 06:12.707
Oh yeah, best float.

06:12.709 --> 06:16.311
My float's such a winner, they'll
have parades in its honor.

06:16.313 --> 06:19.581
My float will have floats.

06:33.864 --> 06:35.096
Whoa.

06:35.098 --> 06:36.965
That sounded good, Gavin.

06:36.967 --> 06:38.967
You know what would
make it sound better?

06:38.969 --> 06:41.903
A new manager!

06:41.905 --> 06:43.571
I owe it all to Ally.

06:43.573 --> 06:45.140
She's such an
amazing songwriter.

06:45.142 --> 06:46.908
Me?

06:46.910 --> 06:49.144
You're the one who came up
with that awesome melody.

06:49.146 --> 06:51.946
I couldn't have done it without your
suggestion to do it in "e" flat.

06:51.948 --> 06:55.350
Did you hear about that story of when
"e" flat, "g" flat, and "b" flat

06:55.352 --> 06:57.051
tried to rent a car?

06:57.053 --> 07:02.123
The guy behind the counter said "I'm sorry.
I can't rent to minors."

07:02.125 --> 07:03.858
Well, of course not.

07:03.860 --> 07:04.993
He'd get in "treble."

07:06.363 --> 07:08.897
What did you do, Ally?

07:08.899 --> 07:11.299
He was so cool when
he walked in here.

07:13.035 --> 07:14.903
It was nice meeting you, Gavin.

07:14.905 --> 07:16.704
Ally, you ready to
work on my song now?

07:16.706 --> 07:18.306
Ooh, can we do that tomorrow?

07:18.308 --> 07:20.175
Gavin and I are gonna
work on another song.

07:20.177 --> 07:21.176
It's a duet.

07:21.178 --> 07:22.844
Another song?

07:22.846 --> 07:23.978
I thought you were
just doing one.

07:23.980 --> 07:26.047
Well, we make a good team.

07:26.049 --> 07:28.049
We're really in "tune"
with each other.

07:28.051 --> 07:29.717
Oh, Gavin.

07:29.719 --> 07:31.152
That's so "clef" -er.

07:33.323 --> 07:34.889
Ooh, I got one.

07:34.891 --> 07:39.060
You know you can tune a piano,
but you can't tuna fish!

07:41.864 --> 07:43.865
Come on, Austin. Let's
get you out of here.

07:43.867 --> 07:46.100
I think their dorkiness
is rubbing off on you.

07:52.141 --> 07:54.175
They were supposed
to do just one song.

07:54.177 --> 07:55.877
Now they're doing another?

07:55.879 --> 07:57.011
Where will it end?

07:57.013 --> 08:01.916
Well, hopefully it'll end when Gavin
finishes his album, wins a grammy,

08:01.918 --> 08:05.153
and thanks me in front of a billion
people for being his manager.

08:05.988 --> 08:09.390
But if she keeps writing with
him, where does that leave me?

08:09.392 --> 08:12.227
I wouldn't have a
career without Ally.

08:12.229 --> 08:13.995
Don't worry.

08:13.997 --> 08:15.997
I won't drop you.

08:15.999 --> 08:19.234
Even the biggest managers
have small clients.

08:29.011 --> 08:31.412
I can't believe Ally missed
another team meeting.

08:31.414 --> 08:34.816
I haven't been able to work with
her all week because of Gavin.

08:34.818 --> 08:36.083
I'm losing my writing partner.

08:36.086 --> 08:39.687
It only feels that way because she's
spending so much time writing with Gavin

08:39.688 --> 08:40.922
and no time with you.

08:40.924 --> 08:42.991
Uh, yeah.

08:42.993 --> 08:45.760
You have to help me steal
back Ally from Gavin.

08:45.762 --> 08:46.895
Why would I do that?

08:46.897 --> 08:48.429
I'm trying to sign
him as a client.

08:48.431 --> 08:49.998
That's not gonna happen.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.333
He's already got a
hotshot manager.

08:52.335 --> 08:55.203
You're not gonna sign Gavin, and
you're gonna lose Ally too.

08:55.205 --> 08:57.105
What do you mean?

08:57.107 --> 08:59.173
He took her from me.

08:59.175 --> 09:01.976
It's only a matter of time
before he takes her from you.

09:03.812 --> 09:05.146
"Hey, Ally.

09:05.148 --> 09:07.081
Why don't you meet
my hotshot manager,

09:07.083 --> 09:10.351
and you can borrow my pen
to sign a new contract.

09:10.353 --> 09:12.420
Actually, keep the pen.

09:12.422 --> 09:15.356
'Cause I'm just that nice."

09:26.468 --> 09:28.002
Oh no.

09:28.004 --> 09:29.337
A power outage.

09:29.339 --> 09:31.139
You can't write
songs in the dark.

09:31.141 --> 09:33.041
Guess you'll have to stop.

09:33.043 --> 09:34.342
Man, that stinks.

09:34.344 --> 09:36.010
I was really having fun.

09:36.012 --> 09:37.211
Wait.

09:37.213 --> 09:39.013
I think I have some candles.

09:39.015 --> 09:41.015
Candles?

09:46.355 --> 09:48.489
Oh, I like it.

09:48.491 --> 09:50.158
It's kind of romantic.

09:50.160 --> 09:51.292
Yeah.

09:51.294 --> 09:53.461
It sets the perfect
mood to write our duet.

09:53.463 --> 09:55.029
Lights on, lights on!

10:07.143 --> 10:09.477
Sorry to interrupt, but I
really need your help, Ally.

10:09.479 --> 10:11.546
Um, can't it wait?

10:11.548 --> 10:13.114
No, this is really important.

10:13.116 --> 10:15.116
I'm trying to finish
the melody to a song

10:15.118 --> 10:17.118
that we were supposed
to write together.

10:17.120 --> 10:19.954
Should it go "bum bum bum bum"

10:19.956 --> 10:22.924
or... "Bum bum bum boom"?

10:24.193 --> 10:25.560
You're hitting the same note.

10:25.562 --> 10:27.528
You're just saying
"boom" instead of "bum."

10:27.530 --> 10:30.098
And that's why I need you.

10:30.100 --> 10:31.566
And I need you...

10:31.568 --> 10:33.001
To leave.

10:33.003 --> 10:35.970
Hey, when I'm done with
Ally, I'll help you, buddy.

10:35.972 --> 10:37.505
I'm good.

10:42.111 --> 10:44.545
Here comes Ally. Act like
it's a real emergency.

10:44.547 --> 10:46.347
- Just don't overdo it.
- Don't worry.

10:46.349 --> 10:47.815
I'll make it natural.

10:49.051 --> 10:51.352
Don't you give up, Austin!

10:51.354 --> 10:53.588
You have too much to live for!

10:55.125 --> 10:56.591
What's the emergency?

10:56.593 --> 10:58.493
I came as soon as Trish called.

10:58.495 --> 11:01.596
I have a splinter.

11:01.598 --> 11:04.198
That's the emergency?

11:07.136 --> 11:08.269
That's not even a splinter.

11:08.271 --> 11:09.937
You just drew on your finger.

11:23.052 --> 11:27.155
It's like half football
theme and half manatee.

11:27.157 --> 11:29.924
This has no chance of
winning best float.

11:29.926 --> 11:31.025
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho.

11:31.027 --> 11:32.293
My half will.

11:32.295 --> 11:35.229
When I push this button, the manatee's
gonna flip his tail and yell

11:35.231 --> 11:36.531
"go manatees!"

11:40.135 --> 11:43.204
Saboteur.

11:43.206 --> 11:46.507
I don't know what you're
talking about, red.

11:46.509 --> 11:48.042
Seriously.

11:48.044 --> 11:51.145
I don't know what "saboteur" means
because I don't speak French.

11:52.147 --> 11:53.915
Check out my side, darlin'.

11:53.917 --> 11:57.185
The quarterback's gonna throw
footballs and yell "touchdown!"

12:01.190 --> 12:02.490
You're the saboteur.

12:02.492 --> 12:04.192
I thought you didn't
speak French.

12:04.194 --> 12:05.393
I lied.

12:05.395 --> 12:06.894
You're gonna pay for this, red.

12:06.896 --> 12:08.563
Or should I say...

12:11.334 --> 12:14.035
Enough!

12:14.037 --> 12:19.006
You two better build a new float
or you're both off the squad.

12:19.008 --> 12:20.408
Bye.

12:24.246 --> 12:26.180
I don't want to be
kicked off the team.

12:26.182 --> 12:27.915
Me neither.

12:27.917 --> 12:29.217
We're gonna have to
learn to work together.

12:29.219 --> 12:32.520
No more fighting, no more
one-upping each other.

12:32.522 --> 12:33.621
Deal.

12:45.134 --> 12:48.936
Ally, can I see
you for a second?

12:48.938 --> 12:51.105
What is it this time?

12:51.107 --> 12:53.107
Your back itches and you want
me to scratch it for you?

12:53.109 --> 12:57.612
That's not what I wanted to talk to you
about, but now that you mention it...

13:00.149 --> 13:01.149
Guess that's a "no."

13:05.321 --> 13:11.192
Ooh. Anyways, I need to talk to
you, but it's kind of private.

13:11.194 --> 13:12.393
Oh, that's fine.

13:12.395 --> 13:15.471
I need to go call some fans, wish them
a good night. You know how that goes.

13:18.734 --> 13:21.235
No one knows how that goes.

13:21.237 --> 13:22.537
Austin, what's up?

13:22.539 --> 13:24.071
You tell me.

13:24.073 --> 13:27.508
We need to work on my music, but you
never make time for me anymore.

13:27.510 --> 13:29.377
I can't just leave Gavin.

13:29.379 --> 13:33.414
You wouldn't like it if I left you I
wouldn't mind if you left writing with me

13:33.416 --> 13:35.116
if it was to write with me.

13:36.051 --> 13:38.052
That makes no sense.

13:38.054 --> 13:39.387
Look.

13:39.389 --> 13:41.022
You have to decide.

13:41.024 --> 13:42.390
Is it gonna be
"Austin and Ally,"

13:42.392 --> 13:43.658
or "Gavin and Ally?"

13:43.660 --> 13:49.096
You're not seriously asking me to
choose between you and Gavin, are you?

13:49.098 --> 13:50.731
Yeah.

13:50.733 --> 13:52.233
I guess I am.

14:11.587 --> 14:13.287
Ally's still upset.

14:13.289 --> 14:15.723
Why did you make her choose
between you and Gavin?

14:15.725 --> 14:17.124
I don't know.

14:17.126 --> 14:20.027
Why did the waitress make me
choose between a soup and salad?

14:21.129 --> 14:23.064
Because all entrees
come with one side.

14:24.233 --> 14:25.566
You know what I think?

14:25.568 --> 14:28.269
You still want to be with Ally,
and Gavin's getting in the way.

14:28.271 --> 14:30.071
What are you talking about?

14:30.073 --> 14:32.073
Ally and I agreed
to just be friends.

14:32.075 --> 14:36.544
Look, this is a simple case of boy
meets girl, boy doesn't want girl

14:36.546 --> 14:39.513
until boy sees girl with another
boy, then boy wants girl back.

14:39.515 --> 14:41.082
Then boy one goes to boy three.

14:41.084 --> 14:42.316
You're boy one, I'm boy three.

14:42.318 --> 14:45.052
I thought it was
supposed to be simple.

14:46.421 --> 14:49.223
Is this about more
than just work?

14:50.092 --> 14:53.060
I guess so.

14:53.062 --> 14:55.396
I realized I still like Ally.

14:55.398 --> 14:57.565
And I want to get back
together with her.

14:57.567 --> 14:59.467
Here we go again.

14:59.469 --> 15:01.802
Are you sure you want
to go down that road?

15:01.804 --> 15:04.071
'Cause it was awfully
bumpy last time.

15:04.073 --> 15:06.674
And we all got a little carsick.

15:06.676 --> 15:08.209
I'm sure.

15:08.211 --> 15:09.477
I'm gonna go talk to her.

15:30.165 --> 15:31.866
That was sweet.

15:31.868 --> 15:33.801
But I'm still mad at you.

15:33.803 --> 15:35.870
I'm really sorry, Ally.

15:35.872 --> 15:38.272
You don't have to choose
between me and Gavin.

15:39.474 --> 15:42.343
Look, there's something
I want to tell you.

15:42.345 --> 15:45.546
One decaf iced mocha with half
soy milk, half low-fat milk,

15:45.548 --> 15:47.548
with light whip and
caramel drizzle.

15:48.817 --> 15:50.551
Aww, you remembered.

15:50.553 --> 15:53.688
Lucky guess.

15:53.690 --> 15:55.423
Ally, I need to ask
you something.

15:55.425 --> 15:56.891
Oh, sure. In a sec.

15:56.893 --> 15:58.694
Austin just wanted to
tell me something first.

15:59.661 --> 16:01.595
I can do it later.

16:03.231 --> 16:04.265
Oh, hey, Austin.

16:04.267 --> 16:07.735
So I carved you a
back scratcher.

16:07.737 --> 16:09.470
Seriously?

16:15.744 --> 16:17.411
Listen, I was thinking.

16:17.413 --> 16:19.146
How would you like to
perform this duet with me?

16:19.148 --> 16:20.414
Really?

16:20.416 --> 16:21.882
That would be great.

16:21.884 --> 16:24.885
We could try it out at the
homecoming pep rAlly.

16:24.887 --> 16:26.754
Perfect. All right, listen.

16:26.756 --> 16:28.889
What I wanted to ask you is...

16:28.891 --> 16:31.192
Will you go on a date with me?

16:32.260 --> 16:34.195
Whoa, really?

16:34.197 --> 16:38.466
Spending all this time with you makes
me realize how much I like you.

16:40.436 --> 16:42.770
I don't know what to say.

16:42.772 --> 16:44.705
Oh, I shouldn't have
sprung all this on you.

16:44.707 --> 16:46.774
Why don't you take some
time to think about it?

16:48.243 --> 16:49.510
Gavin, wait.

16:49.512 --> 16:51.212
Yeah?

16:51.214 --> 16:53.247
Could you leave my mocha?

17:07.896 --> 17:09.829
Great job, guys.

17:09.832 --> 17:11.732
We'll definitely win best float.

17:11.733 --> 17:14.769
Just bring it out to the track
and I'll see you at the parade.

17:14.771 --> 17:16.436
Go manatees!

17:20.208 --> 17:22.510
I told you we'd
make a great team.

17:22.512 --> 17:24.712
Yeah. I got to have
my football launcher,

17:24.714 --> 17:26.446
and you were able to
have your manatee.

17:26.449 --> 17:28.315
A perfect compromise.

17:28.317 --> 17:29.917
Yeah, we're both geniuses.

17:29.919 --> 17:32.920
People won't look up
words in the dictionary.

17:32.922 --> 17:35.689
They'll look up words in the
"Dez and Chuck-tionary."

17:35.691 --> 17:40.428
We're so smart, students with straight
"A" s won't be called valedictorians.

17:40.430 --> 17:42.963
They'll be called
"vale-Chuck-and-Dez-atorians."

17:42.965 --> 17:44.832
Good one.

17:44.834 --> 17:47.301
Now let's get this float out
to the track for the parade.

17:47.303 --> 17:48.702
Whoo!

18:00.515 --> 18:03.317
Did we ever discuss how we were
gonna get this thing out the door?

18:04.386 --> 18:05.486
Nope.

18:11.927 --> 18:14.328
Hello, Marino high! Whoo!

18:20.970 --> 18:24.505
I'm absolutely furious the
cheerleaders don't have a float,

18:24.507 --> 18:26.907
but this is a pep rAlly,
so I have to be peppy!

18:26.909 --> 18:29.343
Whoo!

18:30.378 --> 18:33.614
Anyway, we have a surprise.

18:33.616 --> 18:39.920
Our very own Ally Dawson, and special
guest, country star Gavin Young!

18:39.922 --> 18:42.823
Whoo!

18:46.461 --> 18:47.995
Hey, y'all. Thanks
for having me.

18:47.997 --> 18:51.966
To be singing with this beautiful,
talented young girl right here.

18:52.934 --> 18:55.302
Thanks, Gavin.

18:55.304 --> 18:57.071
This song is called
"me and you."

20:38.006 --> 20:40.975
Ally, you guys were
awesome up there.

20:40.977 --> 20:41.942
Thanks, Austin.

20:41.944 --> 20:43.811
I'm glad you liked it.

20:43.813 --> 20:45.112
Hey, there's something
I want to tell you.

20:45.114 --> 20:46.113
Me too.

20:46.115 --> 20:47.815
You go first.

20:47.817 --> 20:49.016
No, you go first.

20:49.018 --> 20:52.486
Okay, I'll go first.

20:52.488 --> 20:56.523
That I'm not gonna be
working with Gavin anymore.

20:56.525 --> 20:57.825
Yes!

20:57.827 --> 21:01.795
I mean, aww, why?

21:01.797 --> 21:03.864
I thought you guys wrote
so well together.

21:03.866 --> 21:07.935
But I just don't want it
to complicate things.

21:07.937 --> 21:10.004
How would it complicate things?

21:10.006 --> 21:14.575
Because Gavin and I shouldn't work
together if we're going to date.

21:15.810 --> 21:17.645
Wait. You guys are dating?

21:18.948 --> 21:20.948
He asked me out.

21:20.950 --> 21:23.617
So I'm gonna go on
a date with him.

21:25.821 --> 21:28.589
Oh, man. I should
have gone first.

21:28.591 --> 21:30.824
That's great.

21:30.826 --> 21:33.594
You guys will have fun.

21:33.596 --> 21:34.928
So you're good?

21:44.472 --> 21:46.640
So how'd it go?

21:46.642 --> 21:50.110
We're not getting back together.

21:51.579 --> 21:53.647
She's going out with Gavin.

21:53.649 --> 21:56.016
I'm really sorry, Austin.

21:59.020 --> 22:01.021
So you don't happen to know

22:01.023 --> 22:04.892
if Gavin mentioned anything
about me becoming his manager?

22:11.867 --> 22:15.903
We're really sorry for messing
up this year's homecoming float.

22:15.905 --> 22:17.971
But before you kick
us off the squad,

22:17.973 --> 22:20.708
let us show you our idea
for next year's float.

22:20.710 --> 22:22.142
This better be good.

22:22.144 --> 22:23.877
Trust us.

22:29.084 --> 22:31.085
I don't get it.

22:32.101 --> 22:33.821
I thought we were
supposed to be corn dogs.

22:33.823 --> 22:35.089
People love food on a stick.

22:35.091 --> 22:36.824
No, we agreed to do bunnies.

22:36.826 --> 22:38.659
People love Fluffy
things that hop.

22:38.661 --> 22:39.993
- Corn dogs.
- Bunnies.

22:39.995 --> 22:41.028
- Corn dogs.
- Bunnies.

22:41.030 --> 22:41.962
- Corn dogs!
- Bunnies!

22:41.964 --> 22:43.664
- Corn dogs!
- Bunnies!

22:43.666 --> 22:45.199
<i>- Corn dogs!
- Bunnies!</i>
