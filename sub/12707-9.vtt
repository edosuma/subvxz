00:02.536 --> 00:05.238
GILES:
 Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

00:13.012 --> 00:15.382
This dark spell I hold
in my worthless hand

00:15.416 --> 00:17.550
is our gift to you,
Glorificus.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.687
Please. Call me Glory.

00:19.719 --> 00:22.522
What if she's something else
altogether?

00:22.556 --> 00:25.259
-Something new, you mean.
-Something old.

00:25.292 --> 00:27.527
So old it predates
the written word.

00:27.561 --> 00:30.431
Lady, whatever you are,
please. I have
two daughters.

00:30.463 --> 00:32.365
(shouting)

00:38.606 --> 00:44.677
The key is energy.
My brethren
sent it to you.

00:44.712 --> 00:45.845
Dawn.

00:45.878 --> 00:47.680
She has no idea.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.084
No.

00:50.118 --> 00:52.552
She thinks
she's my kid sister.

00:52.585 --> 00:55.222
I have to take care of her.

00:58.125 --> 01:00.393
Your mother has
low-grade glioma.

01:00.427 --> 01:02.463
It's a brain tumor.

01:06.233 --> 01:09.069
Listen, you two, I know
this cream spinach
is pretty delicious,

01:09.102 --> 01:12.640
but I promise I won't be
offended if you go out
for some real food.

01:12.673 --> 01:15.075
Are you kidding me?
This is the good life:

01:15.108 --> 01:18.445
relaxing in bed
while people bring you
food on trays.

01:18.478 --> 01:20.046
I like the Jell-O.

01:20.079 --> 01:22.049
Help yourself.

01:22.081 --> 01:25.718
There's something about food
that moves by itself that
gives me the heebie-jeebies.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.987
It's good and wiggly.
This girl at school told me

01:28.021 --> 01:31.224
that gelatin is made
from ground-up cow's feet

01:31.259 --> 01:34.462
and that if you eat Jell-O,
there's some cow out there
limpin' with no feet.

01:34.495 --> 01:37.798
But I told her I'm sure
they kill it before they
take off their feet.

01:37.831 --> 01:40.734
Right?

01:40.768 --> 01:43.637
You're the one
who insisted on
teaching her to talk.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.307
Oh, hello, Dr. Kriegel.

01:47.341 --> 01:50.478
-You know my girls--
Buffy and Dawn.
-Yes, of course.

01:50.510 --> 01:54.347
You two are becoming part
of the regular crew around here.
Just keeping her company.

01:54.382 --> 01:57.185
Good. Just be careful
you don't wear her out.

01:57.218 --> 02:00.620
Oh, don't worry about that.
I woke up exhausted.

02:00.653 --> 02:03.356
There's really no more
exhausted to get.

02:04.557 --> 02:07.260
Well, maybe some
good news will help.

02:07.295 --> 02:10.163
The blood work's
come back from the lab,
and everything seems fine.

02:10.264 --> 02:14.735
So we've scheduled your surgery
for day after tomorrow
at 10:00 in the morning.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.170
How's that sound to you?

02:17.204 --> 02:19.473
Oh, well, I think
they had me scheduled
for volleyball,

02:19.507 --> 02:21.709
but, uh, I can work
around it.

02:21.741 --> 02:24.478
All right, then.
Joyce, you take care.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.447
Make sure and get
some good solid rest.

02:26.479 --> 02:28.316
And I mean that.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.020
Oh, the day after tomorrow.

02:33.052 --> 02:36.289
I don't think I can stand
to stay here another two days
just waiting.

02:36.324 --> 02:39.826
Waiting?
Give me a break. We've got--
We've got tons to do.

02:39.860 --> 02:44.331
We have soap operas to watch
and trashy magazines to read.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.300
An adjustable bed
to fiddle with.

02:46.334 --> 02:48.336
That alone
will keep me busy
for four hours or so.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.837
I really don't need you
to stay here, Buffy.

02:50.871 --> 02:53.540
-I know you've got
patrolling to do.
-Not tonight.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.808
Tonight I have
Mom-taking-care-of to do.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.844
Besides, Riley's
filling in for me
with the others.

02:57.877 --> 02:59.680
I'm sure
they have everything
under control.

03:26.439 --> 03:28.542
Ah!

03:43.324 --> 03:46.960
-Hey! Human chest! Human chest!
-Sorry.

03:52.932 --> 03:56.469
Oh, my god.
What a rough night.

03:56.503 --> 04:00.073
I dusted two of 'em!
Yea on me!

04:00.106 --> 04:03.242
That was pretty cool,
except the part where
I was all terrified,

04:03.276 --> 04:06.112
and now my knees
are all dizzy.

04:06.145 --> 04:10.283
Whoa.
Not so much a big
success night for me,

04:10.318 --> 04:12.620
but I think I
should get points
just for showing up,

04:12.652 --> 04:16.824
unlike some Riley Finn
who shall remain unnamed.

04:16.856 --> 04:20.327
Yes, that was disappointing.
Things would've been easier
if he'd been here.

04:20.360 --> 04:23.831
Oh, piffle! Who needs him
when I'm dustin' two at a ti--

04:23.863 --> 04:27.000
Whoops. Maybe
it would've been good
if he had showed up.

04:27.033 --> 04:28.968
Perhaps he forgot.

04:32.505 --> 04:35.509
(slurping)

05:11.545 --> 05:12.646
(theme music playing)

06:03.230 --> 06:04.531
Care package!

06:04.564 --> 06:06.766
Special delivery
for the Summers girls.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.903
Now, let's see what I have
in this sack of mine.

06:09.937 --> 06:12.839
Oh, I feel just like
Santa Claus, except thinner
and younger

06:12.872 --> 06:15.543
and female and, well, Jewish.

06:15.576 --> 06:20.514
This is an extra special gift
for your mom that I know
she'll need--

06:20.548 --> 06:22.783
A beer hat!

06:22.815 --> 06:24.718
See? It's got cup holders

06:24.752 --> 06:27.454
and a straw that goes
directly into your mouth,

06:27.487 --> 06:29.622
and you can fill it
with other stuff than beer.

06:29.656 --> 06:33.125
And somehow, when I was
in the store, this seemed
like the most important idea,

06:33.159 --> 06:36.295
and now there's the whole part
where I'm crazy.

06:36.329 --> 06:37.531
It's perfect.

06:37.564 --> 06:40.433
Thank you, Willow.
You're very sweet.

06:40.468 --> 06:44.771
Now, let's see, who's next?
Dawn, I believe I have
something in here for you.

06:44.805 --> 06:45.838
Headache?

06:46.939 --> 06:48.307
Just a little one.

06:48.341 --> 06:50.911
Biggish little one.

06:50.944 --> 06:53.079
I'm fine.

06:53.112 --> 06:56.249
Go on. What else is in that
sack of goodies, Willow?

06:56.283 --> 06:57.918
All right.

06:57.951 --> 07:01.288
Dawn, to keep you busy--

07:01.321 --> 07:04.156
Oh, spells! Thank you, Willow.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.759
You got her a book on spells?

07:05.793 --> 07:08.661
The girl who can
break things by just
looking at them

07:08.696 --> 07:12.500
now has a book to teach her
to break things
by looking at them?

07:12.533 --> 07:16.103
Oh, it doesn't actually
have spells in it.
Just history and anecdotes.

07:16.136 --> 07:20.774
Stuff like that.
Oh, Buffy, I have this for you.

07:22.475 --> 07:24.677
Homework? Oh.

07:24.711 --> 07:26.846
I don't believe in tiny
Jewish Santa anymore.

07:26.879 --> 07:28.281
And a yo-yo.

07:28.314 --> 07:30.449
Thank you.

07:30.483 --> 07:33.353
The book is just in case
you get a chance
to look it over.

07:33.386 --> 07:37.156
We're doing World War I now.
The last exam was really
pretty easy.

07:37.189 --> 07:39.659
Just underlying causes
and trench foot.

07:39.692 --> 07:41.694
So it should be no hassle
to make it up.

07:41.728 --> 07:43.463
I don't even know if I'm
gonna take that exam.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.865
I'd rip it in half and
stick it in bed with me!

07:48.536 --> 07:51.738
Mom?

07:54.875 --> 07:56.976
You know, I think I'm gonna
take a little rest now.

07:57.009 --> 07:58.978
Okay.

08:00.247 --> 08:03.016
We'll be right outside
if you need us.

08:14.060 --> 08:17.665
What was she talking about?
I mean, that was weird.

08:17.697 --> 08:19.567
She's gonna be fine.

08:19.600 --> 08:23.302
It's okay. I'm sorry.
The doctor spoke to me,

08:23.336 --> 08:25.706
and, uh, I should
have told you.

08:25.805 --> 08:29.709
Um, the-- the thing
that's pressing
on her brain,

08:29.742 --> 08:32.580
sometimes
it might make her
say weird things.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.914
Does she know
she's saying them?

08:36.783 --> 08:40.187
Not really. It's sort of
like a flash, you know.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.489
But you saw her
two seconds afterwards.
She was normal.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.158
And after the operation,
no more pressing.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.259
She'll be all normal
all the time.

08:47.293 --> 08:48.562
Is that right?

08:48.596 --> 08:50.529
Hey, Santa
doesn't lie.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.533
Oh. Excuse me.

08:53.567 --> 08:57.070
Careful. The facts say
a picnic is in order.

08:57.104 --> 08:59.438
What is that thing?

08:59.471 --> 09:03.576
Th-there's no data.
There's no pictures
on this one. There!

09:03.610 --> 09:07.147
What is the data?
There's no one in there.

09:07.246 --> 09:09.416
Buffy.

09:09.448 --> 09:12.119
Come on, honey.
Don't worry about it.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.123
Can we go home? Home?

09:16.155 --> 09:18.258
Home, home, home.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.893
What's wrong with him?

09:22.095 --> 09:24.898
Is it like Mom,
a thing in his head?

09:24.932 --> 09:28.100
I don't think so.
I think it's different.
Don't worry about it.

09:28.134 --> 09:30.202
I guess I missed that.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.904
Was he bothering you?

09:31.938 --> 09:34.073
Hey, Ben.
This is my friend Willow.

09:34.106 --> 09:35.908
-Hi.
-Hi.

09:35.942 --> 09:40.113
And, uh, yeah, the crazy man
was a little, you know, crazy,
but it's okay.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.282
Are they really
gonna send him home?

09:42.315 --> 09:44.817
Don't get me started.
The mental ward's booked
beyond capacity,

09:44.851 --> 09:46.986
literally nowhere
to put them,

09:47.019 --> 09:49.722
so the ones with families,
they're letting 'em go home.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.825
Like his family's
gonna be able
to take care of him.

09:51.859 --> 09:54.326
He has to have someone
watch him 24-7.

09:54.360 --> 09:57.297
What was he
saying to you?

09:57.330 --> 10:00.768
Oh, he was just...
babbling.

10:11.477 --> 10:13.980
You know what's weird?

10:14.014 --> 10:16.615
Japanese commercials
are weird.

10:16.649 --> 10:20.586
Yes. And also...

10:20.620 --> 10:23.791
you know, some of the stars
we're looking at...

10:23.823 --> 10:26.826
don't even exist anymore.

10:26.860 --> 10:30.697
In the time that it
takes for their light
to reach us,

10:30.730 --> 10:34.802
they've died, exploded.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.837
Poof.

10:37.870 --> 10:41.875
Were, um, were things
rough at the hospital?

10:45.678 --> 10:49.448
You know, I used to
love to look up at them
when I was little.

10:49.481 --> 10:53.552
They're supposed
to make you feel
all insignificant,

10:53.586 --> 10:57.389
but they
made me feel like...

10:57.423 --> 11:01.327
like I was in space.

11:01.360 --> 11:04.464
Part of the stars.

11:04.496 --> 11:08.335
There's Canis Minor...

11:08.368 --> 11:11.038
and Cassiopeia.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.408
And the Big Pineapple.

11:17.244 --> 11:22.414
Um, you know, I'm not sure
I remember that one.
Oh, it's a major one.

11:24.784 --> 11:28.221
See those three bright stars
right over there?

11:29.588 --> 11:30.890
WILLOW:
Yeah.

11:30.923 --> 11:34.894
And see those stars
along there?

11:37.029 --> 11:41.201
That's the bottom
of the pineapple.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.668
It's big.

11:42.701 --> 11:46.173
Hence the name.

11:46.206 --> 11:50.143
The real ones
never made sense to me.
I sort of have my own.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.145
Teach me.

11:57.317 --> 12:00.452
See those stars over there?

12:00.486 --> 12:02.554
"Short man
looking uncomfortable."

12:05.591 --> 12:09.528
"Moose getting
a sponge bath."

12:09.562 --> 12:11.965
Hmm.

12:11.999 --> 12:14.267
"Little pile o' crackers."

12:15.903 --> 12:18.871
That was a bit of a stretch.

12:18.905 --> 12:22.442
You do it.
What would you call...

12:22.475 --> 12:25.611
-That one?
-Hmm.

12:25.644 --> 12:27.614
I see...

12:30.750 --> 12:33.787
A huge flaming meteor
about to crash
into something.

12:36.456 --> 12:39.658
(rocks falling)

13:05.485 --> 13:08.087
I know what I said.
I said--

13:08.120 --> 13:10.756
I said I won't go away far.

13:10.789 --> 13:14.027
A person needs to respect a man.
A man says...

13:14.061 --> 13:16.428
That-- The facts says...

13:16.462 --> 13:19.499
he's got to go take a walk
to get some fresh air

13:19.532 --> 13:21.869
and find some fresh spaces.

13:23.403 --> 13:26.639
And-- and he needs to walk--
and some... Space!

13:26.673 --> 13:30.677
And needs to walk to get--
to get where he's going.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.254
(chattering, indistinct)

13:42.754 --> 13:47.927
(chattering continues)

13:55.235 --> 13:57.203
This thing doesn't work.
It isn't working.

13:57.236 --> 13:59.338
I'm sure they heard you.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.808
I bet it's not even
hooked up to anything.

14:02.841 --> 14:05.812
Just like the push buttons at
the crosswalk that are supposed
to make the signal change.

14:05.845 --> 14:09.716
I'm sure someone's-- Wait.
The push buttons aren't
hooked up to anything?

14:12.284 --> 14:15.855
Oh, tell him, Buffy.
Tell him, okay?

14:15.889 --> 14:19.225
Look, Dr. Kriegel,
we wanna go home.

14:19.259 --> 14:22.562
Well, of course. You can
come back and visit your mother
first thing in the morning.

14:22.595 --> 14:27.833
No. We.
I mean all of us.

14:27.866 --> 14:32.038
-My mom too.
-Oh. Well,
I understand that.

14:32.072 --> 14:35.107
But it's not necessarily
the first thing I'd recommend.

14:35.142 --> 14:37.576
JOYCE:
I can't.

14:37.610 --> 14:40.779
I can't stay here
waiting for two days
for this operation.

14:40.812 --> 14:45.018
I just can't. It makes
my head hurt to be here.
Can't you tell that?

14:45.052 --> 14:47.886
-Joyce, there's no reason
to get upset.
-No reason to get upset?

14:47.921 --> 14:50.789
Oh, right. Sorry.
I must just think there is
'cause of my brain tumor!

14:54.626 --> 14:57.730
Here, Dawn. Why don't you
get something from the machine?

15:04.937 --> 15:06.974
I'm sorry I said that.

15:07.006 --> 15:09.775
-I'm just so tired.
-I know.

15:09.808 --> 15:14.246
Listen, Doctor, I don't see
why we can't take her home,
you know, just until--

15:15.514 --> 15:17.549
I mean, wouldn't it
be better for her

15:17.583 --> 15:20.820
to rest someplace
where she felt safe
and comfortable?

15:20.852 --> 15:25.057
Even if it would
mean some work for you,
taking care of her?

15:25.091 --> 15:26.592
Oh, thank god.

15:26.625 --> 15:28.061
I'll do it. Anything.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.763
There are medications
to administer.

15:30.797 --> 15:34.667
I'd have to go over those
with you. And I'd need
for you to check her vitals.

15:34.701 --> 15:38.004
Watch her pretty closely.
I'm afraid you won't
get a lot of sleep.

15:38.038 --> 15:41.107
I'm not much of
a sleep person anyway.

15:41.140 --> 15:44.110
-Can we go now? Let's go now.
-Oh, hold on a minute.

15:44.144 --> 15:47.913
Let me get all the medications
and all the instructions
on how to do everything.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.915
She's right.
Let's do this right.

15:49.948 --> 15:52.318
We don't want
to forget anything.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.125
(indistinct)

16:02.894 --> 16:05.532
Everyone stay close.

16:05.565 --> 16:09.302
I'm glad you
called me in on this.
Glad you answered.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.538
Oh, yeah. Sorry
about last time.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.706
Heard I missed out
on some fun.

16:13.740 --> 16:18.677
Oh, yeah. Fun was had.
Also frolic, merriment
and near-death hijinks.

16:18.711 --> 16:21.213
Look. There it is.

16:23.316 --> 16:27.254
WILLOW:
Wow. We have meteorite.

16:29.188 --> 16:33.225
Is it hot? 'Cause, uh,
if there's radiation,

16:33.259 --> 16:35.095
you could, like,
go all sterile.

16:38.398 --> 16:41.834
No, it's not hot.
It's warm.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.735
And broken.

16:46.938 --> 16:48.975
-And sort of--
-Hollow.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.644
Yeah.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.246
So, uh, we're all thinkin'
the same thing, right?

16:54.280 --> 16:57.149
Festive piñata?
Delicious candy?

16:57.183 --> 16:59.885
Something evil
crashed to earth in this

16:59.918 --> 17:03.822
and then broke out
and slithered away
to do badness.

17:03.855 --> 17:07.992
In all fairness,
I don't think we know
about the slithered part.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.029
Oh, no. I'm sure
it frisked about
like a fluffy lamb.

17:11.064 --> 17:14.467
Let's look around.
Maybe we can figure out
where it went.

17:30.282 --> 17:32.318
It went here.

17:45.897 --> 17:47.700
RILEY:
No pulse.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.135
ANYA:
Yep.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.671
The space lamb got him.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.711
-I don't see any marks on him.
-I-I know him.

17:58.744 --> 18:02.148
He was at the hospital.
A mental patient.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.016
They released him today.

18:09.455 --> 18:11.891
Riley, what
are you doing?

18:11.923 --> 18:14.294
I'm not sure.
There's something--

18:17.297 --> 18:19.999
(all groaning)

18:21.300 --> 18:23.435
That might be toxic.
Don't touch it.

18:23.470 --> 18:26.605
-(gagging)
-Oh, yeah. Touching it
was my first impulse.

18:26.638 --> 18:28.641
Luckily, I've moved on
to my second,

18:28.674 --> 18:31.478
which involves dry-heaving
and running like hell.

18:31.510 --> 18:34.413
-Oh, man, does that smell.
-So what do we do now?

18:34.447 --> 18:36.348
WILLOW:
We can't call Buffy.

18:36.383 --> 18:38.851
I want to call Buffy.

18:38.884 --> 18:42.755
You can't.
She's got life stuff
that has to come first.

18:42.788 --> 18:45.357
So-- so we'll just
figure this out ourselves.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.926
-We're experienced.
-Yes.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.697
'Cause it seems like
we're always dealing with
creatures from outer space,

18:50.730 --> 18:52.664
except that
we don't ever do that.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.336
This is definitely
new territory.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.705
Perhaps we should
explore a bit more...

19:00.906 --> 19:02.808
head into the woods a bit.

19:02.842 --> 19:04.344
(animal noises)

19:06.479 --> 19:07.980
Who votes research?

19:08.013 --> 19:10.016
-Research!
-GILES: Much better idea.

19:10.048 --> 19:12.117
Yeah, I think that's
a good call. There could have
been some other cases like this.

19:12.151 --> 19:15.020
I'm gonna stay here,
examine the body
some more...

19:15.054 --> 19:16.955
look around
a little bit.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.659
Yeah. Don't do
anything hunterly.

19:19.692 --> 19:23.730
No. I'm just not great at
research, which I'm sure
you guys have figured out.

19:23.762 --> 19:25.832
I like me
a good crime scene.

19:25.865 --> 19:28.667
Um, give us a call
if you need help?
Believe me,

19:28.701 --> 19:32.404
somethin' jumps out at me
in the dark, you'll hear me
even without the phone.

19:32.439 --> 19:34.540
RILEY: Call me if you
learn anything.

19:34.574 --> 19:39.010
You got it.
I don't want to be the one
that finds the bodies anymore.

19:46.919 --> 19:50.356
(dialing, line ringing)

19:52.358 --> 19:55.362
I need to speak to the man
at the desk. This is Ag--

19:55.394 --> 19:58.431
This is Riley Finn.

19:58.464 --> 20:01.933
You have an Agent Miller--
Graham Miller.
He'll tell you who--

20:01.968 --> 20:04.737
Yes. Emergency frequency.

20:09.075 --> 20:12.244
Cold. Cold.

20:12.278 --> 20:13.779
Cold.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.556
Wait. You can't go.

20:23.589 --> 20:26.393
Don't you be that kind
of barn owl!

20:26.425 --> 20:30.696
Please!
Please don't go. Please.

20:30.730 --> 20:35.434
Please don't go.
(sobbing)

20:35.468 --> 20:38.471
Please. Please don't--

20:43.241 --> 20:45.278
(scurrying)

20:51.784 --> 20:54.520
I can't see you.
I can't see you.
I can't see you.

20:59.291 --> 21:00.292
(screeching)

21:00.326 --> 21:03.630
(man screaming)

21:05.765 --> 21:08.667
(screeching)

21:16.107 --> 21:18.176
Well, I guess
we're all set then.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.747
You've got
my home phone number,
my pager number.

21:20.779 --> 21:23.816
And here.
These are the medications
I talked to you about.

21:23.849 --> 21:27.519
The sedative and so forth.
Painkillers.

21:27.554 --> 21:29.756
Right. No problem.

21:29.788 --> 21:31.857
Now, if this is gonna
be too much for you,

21:31.891 --> 21:34.160
we can make your mom
perfectly comfortable here.

21:34.192 --> 21:38.263
No. No, no. I got this.
And we really,
really appreciate--

21:38.297 --> 21:40.767
You look just like
your father when he cries.

21:40.799 --> 21:44.103
And what do you think
he was begging for?

21:44.135 --> 21:47.374
-I told you she's been--
-I know.

21:47.406 --> 21:48.508
Joyce?

21:49.741 --> 21:53.112
Joyce. We're all done here.

21:53.144 --> 21:55.181
Why don't you
take your girls home now?

21:55.213 --> 21:57.884
Yes. Yes. Thank you.

21:57.916 --> 21:59.317
Thank you for
all your help, Doctor.

21:59.352 --> 22:00.853
I'll see you
in a couple of days.

22:02.422 --> 22:05.892
Oh, let's get the hell
out of here.

22:16.935 --> 22:19.204
BUFFY:
Here we go.

22:21.073 --> 22:24.977
Oh, it's nice to be home.
Do you want to go
into bed, mom?

22:25.010 --> 22:28.047
Oh! Buffy, no.
That light, it's too bright.

22:28.079 --> 22:31.182
It's too bright.
It's too bright.
Oh, okay, okay.

22:31.217 --> 22:33.519
Buffy, it hurts, it hurts.
It hurts my eyes.

22:33.552 --> 22:35.186
It's off. It's off.

22:35.221 --> 22:37.155
You know what?
Why don't you shut off
the lights in the living room,

22:37.189 --> 22:39.357
and I will take you upstairs,
and we'll shut off all
the lights up there, okay?

22:39.392 --> 22:41.259
Come on.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.711
-You Finn?
-Yeah.

23:32.744 --> 23:35.615
Major Ellis.
I'm in charge of this op.
What's the situation?

23:35.647 --> 23:40.219
Just the one civilian casualty?
That I know of. This way.

23:40.251 --> 23:42.822
Found a stiff
in the woods
and called us in?

23:42.855 --> 23:45.692
Don't you usually call
your girlfriend for
this kind of thing?

23:54.701 --> 23:57.737
I wouldn't touch that stuff
in his mouth if I were you.

23:57.769 --> 23:59.872
-Toxic?
-No. Just messy.

24:01.207 --> 24:04.911
Guy seemed to have simply
choked on the stuff.

24:04.943 --> 24:08.714
Near as I can tell,
it's some kind of
protein alkaloid.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.622
Does this fit the profile
of any Sub-T you're
familiar with?

24:15.654 --> 24:18.790
It's not subterrestrial,
major. Extraterrestrial.

24:20.626 --> 24:23.194
It came out of that.

24:23.229 --> 24:25.798
Miller, set the trackers
for a protein signature.

24:25.832 --> 24:28.000
Yes, sir.

24:28.034 --> 24:30.169
No good, Major.

24:30.201 --> 24:32.672
This alkaloid's breakin' down
at an accelerated rate.

24:32.704 --> 24:34.373
It's dissolving
too fast to track.

24:34.405 --> 24:37.710
-You got a better idea?
-Thing came from space.

24:37.743 --> 24:40.846
Gotta be some
trace radiation.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.048
We have Geiger counters
in the packs.

24:43.082 --> 24:45.852
Shouldn't be too much
background gamma noise
out here.

24:45.884 --> 24:47.753
Break 'em out.

24:53.058 --> 24:55.894
(laughter on TV)

24:55.927 --> 24:57.829
-(chattering on TV)
-(slithering)

25:21.854 --> 25:24.089
(clattering)

25:28.059 --> 25:31.564
-Mom?
-(clattering)

25:36.134 --> 25:38.738
Oh, my-- Oh.
(coughs)

25:40.873 --> 25:42.775
Mom, what are you doing?

25:42.808 --> 25:45.877
I'm making breakfast.

25:45.912 --> 25:48.279
You shouldn't eat any more.
You're disgustingly fat.

25:54.452 --> 25:56.288
Oh, Buffy, I don't know
what I'm doing.

25:56.322 --> 25:58.724
You just
need some rest.

25:58.758 --> 26:00.826
We'll put you
back to bed.

26:14.472 --> 26:17.777
Okay. There you go.

26:17.809 --> 26:20.546
That will help you sleep.

26:20.578 --> 26:23.750
Come on.
Get you all tucked into bed.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.458
(gasps)
Don't touch me!

26:33.459 --> 26:35.795
You-- you thing.

26:35.827 --> 26:39.065
-Mom, please.
-Get away from me.

26:39.097 --> 26:42.567
-You're nothing.
You're a shadow.
-Mom.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.503
-I don't know what you are
or how you got here.
-Mom, it's Dawn.

26:45.537 --> 26:47.338
Dawn, honey, what's wrong?

26:47.373 --> 26:49.407
(door slams)

26:49.441 --> 26:53.779
She's just tired.
We all are. Come on.

26:53.813 --> 26:55.213
Go to sleep.

26:56.883 --> 26:59.218
I'll check in on you
in a little bit.

27:11.730 --> 27:14.133
She hates me.

27:16.803 --> 27:18.938
No.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.339
She called me a thing.

27:21.373 --> 27:25.376
She loves you, okay?
She's not herself.

27:25.411 --> 27:28.013
I told you
what the doctor said
about the tumor.

27:28.047 --> 27:33.652
No, not just mom.

27:33.685 --> 27:37.655
People. They keep saying
weird stuff about me.

27:37.690 --> 27:40.058
Are you talking about
the man in the hospital?

27:40.092 --> 27:43.695
He called me a thing too.

27:43.730 --> 27:47.199
And there was another one.
A weird guy
outside the magic shop.

27:49.935 --> 27:51.971
He said I didn't belong.

27:52.003 --> 27:53.940
He said I wasn't real.

27:56.776 --> 27:59.510
Why does everybody
keep doing that?

27:59.545 --> 28:01.079
What's wrong with me?

28:01.113 --> 28:03.515
Nothing. It's not you.

28:06.617 --> 28:10.321
I think there's something
that happens in people's brains
when there's something wrong.

28:10.355 --> 28:13.893
It's-- It's like
a short circuit,

28:13.925 --> 28:17.896
and it makes them feel
like nothing's real
except for them.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.798
That's all it is.

28:22.934 --> 28:27.439
Look, it is not you, okay?

28:27.472 --> 28:31.576
And if anyone
says anything like that
to you again,

28:31.609 --> 28:34.913
don't listen,
even if it's Mom.

28:39.550 --> 28:41.686
I hate it.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.588
I know.

28:45.624 --> 28:47.558
Just don't listen.

28:50.461 --> 28:54.200
Look at how teeny Mercury is
compared to, like, Saturn.

28:54.232 --> 28:57.135
Whereas in contrast,
the cars of the same name--

28:57.169 --> 28:59.471
Xander, please,
we have work to do here.

29:00.906 --> 29:03.142
I still don't get
why we had to come here

29:03.174 --> 29:06.813
to get info about
a killer snot monster.

29:06.846 --> 29:09.515
Because it's
a killer snot monster
from outer space.

29:11.450 --> 29:12.683
I did not say that.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.823
Demons enter our world in
all sorts of different ways.

29:16.855 --> 29:19.057
This one came from above.

29:19.090 --> 29:23.328
And the University Library's
Astronomy Section is the home
of "aboveness." Got it.

29:23.362 --> 29:26.464
Hey, diggin'
the study material too.

29:26.498 --> 29:28.467
We've been scouring
all the international
periodicals

29:28.500 --> 29:30.336
for any other
meteorite landings
in the last week.

29:30.368 --> 29:32.070
Big zippo.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.640
Well, then it would appear
that the world
is not being invaded.

29:34.673 --> 29:36.909
-I'm pretty pleased about that.
-WILLOW: Uh, guys?

29:36.942 --> 29:39.644
I've got some stuff.

29:39.677 --> 29:45.084
The most recent meteoric anomaly
was the Tunguska blast
in Russia in 1917.

29:45.116 --> 29:48.019
Some witnesses claimed
the meteor was hollow.
Hmm.

29:48.054 --> 29:51.156
Maybe with a chewy
demon center, like ours.

29:51.190 --> 29:54.359
How far back does this
list of anomalies go?
Pretty far.

29:54.393 --> 29:57.262
Back to the Queller Impact
in the 12th century.

29:57.296 --> 30:00.199
-The what?
-Queller. I don't know
why they call it that.

30:00.231 --> 30:02.835
It didn't hit a place
called Queller or anything.

30:02.868 --> 30:05.270
It landed just outside
of Reykjavik in Iceland.

30:05.304 --> 30:06.905
XANDER:
Wait. I just saw--

30:08.007 --> 30:10.476
Queller. Quell--

30:10.509 --> 30:13.444
Ah. Here. Here.

30:13.479 --> 30:16.883
"Primitive people used
to believe that the moon
was a cause of insanity.

30:16.915 --> 30:19.117
"Sometimes they
would pray to the moon
to send a special meteor

30:19.151 --> 30:21.153
"to fix the problem
the moon had caused.

30:21.186 --> 30:26.525
These meteors were expected
to quell... the madmen."

30:26.557 --> 30:29.795
The man in the woods--
he was a mental patient.

30:29.827 --> 30:32.830
And he got
pretty well quelled.

30:32.865 --> 30:35.067
Okay, I'm looking
in history right now.

30:35.101 --> 30:39.404
It says in the middle ages,
there were these sweeping
plagues of madness.

30:39.438 --> 30:41.507
People were losing
their marbles everywhere,

30:41.539 --> 30:43.910
but then it would
suddenly subside.

30:43.942 --> 30:47.645
And these dates
look pretty close.

30:47.679 --> 30:51.182
Like maybe it happened
after each one of
the meteor events.

30:51.217 --> 30:54.653
As if something emerged
from the meteors...

30:54.685 --> 30:56.688
and quelled the madmen.

30:56.721 --> 30:58.990
Meteor go boom,
crazy guy goes bye-bye.

30:59.025 --> 31:00.992
Xander's little book
made it sound like

31:01.027 --> 31:05.663
this Queller thing
had to be summoned, so...

31:05.696 --> 31:08.166
Who summoned it?
XANDER:
Who else?

31:08.200 --> 31:11.769
My money's on Glory,
our resident beastie summoner.

31:11.803 --> 31:16.575
We should call Buffy.
Except we can't call Buffy.
Can we?

31:16.607 --> 31:19.045
No, but we'd
better call Riley.

31:19.077 --> 31:21.579
A Queller demon?
WILLOW:
Yeah. That's our perp.

31:21.613 --> 31:24.415
It's sort of a scavenger
that can be summoned
to kill--

31:24.450 --> 31:27.853
Crazy people.
Yeah.
How'd you know?

31:27.885 --> 31:30.556
'Cause I've got five corpses
here at the mental ward
at Sunnydale Memorial.

31:30.588 --> 31:34.292
You're at the hospital?
Listen, Riley, I--

31:34.326 --> 31:38.896
I saw Buffy's mom earlier,
and she was acting
kinda... wacky.

31:38.931 --> 31:41.732
Insane wacky,
if you know what I mean.

31:41.767 --> 31:43.734
It's okay. Joyce
was released earlier today.

31:43.769 --> 31:47.739
That intern, um, Ben, told me.
They're safe at home.

31:47.772 --> 31:52.711
Oh, good.
And the thing, the Queller,
is it still there?

31:52.743 --> 31:56.015
We-- I think I've got it
cornered in the air ducts.

32:00.086 --> 32:02.421
Look, Willow,
keep at what you're doing.

32:02.453 --> 32:04.323
Call me if you find out
how I can kill this thing.

32:04.355 --> 32:06.258
Well, okay, but
shouldn't we come help?

32:06.291 --> 32:09.728
-(dial tone)
-Okay.

32:09.760 --> 32:13.265
I wish that someone had bothered
to tell me that there would be
tennis being played.

32:13.298 --> 32:15.500
I just didn't know.

32:15.534 --> 32:17.669
Those eyes.

32:17.702 --> 32:22.740
Those eyes, they're
like gasoline puddles.

32:22.773 --> 32:25.443
Tell me. Tell me
because I need to know why.

32:25.477 --> 32:27.778
Why are you staring
at me like that?

32:27.813 --> 32:31.650
JOYCE:
What are you asking me?
You are asking me, aren't you?

32:31.682 --> 32:34.653
Is this a test?
And if this counts
on the final grade,

32:34.685 --> 32:36.855
I need to know now.

32:36.887 --> 32:39.157
Okay, there are teachers and
they put this in the syllabus,

32:39.191 --> 32:41.192
but they do not
stare down at you.

32:41.227 --> 32:44.997
They do not cling.
They do not look down on you.

32:47.165 --> 32:49.268
You know there
are people who are nice,

32:49.300 --> 32:52.137
and they give you presents,
even when you are bad.

32:53.739 --> 32:55.574
(Spanish music playing)

33:27.205 --> 33:29.674
(sobbing)

33:50.261 --> 33:52.763
Does someone know you're here?
Because they should have
told you that at the gate.

33:52.798 --> 33:54.700
You're not supposed
to be here.

33:54.732 --> 33:57.435
I need to rest now.

33:57.469 --> 33:59.404
I don't like the way
you're staring at me.

33:59.438 --> 34:03.075
Did they tell you that
at the gate?

34:03.108 --> 34:06.444
Stop staring at me!
I don't like it!

34:06.478 --> 34:08.547
(softly)
Please?

34:13.918 --> 34:17.322
(beeping)

34:22.728 --> 34:25.563
The trail stops here,
edge of the parking lot.

34:25.597 --> 34:27.965
-It stops?
-A car.

34:27.998 --> 34:31.402
It hitched a ride,
probably underneath.

34:31.436 --> 34:36.242
So much for containment.
So some poor mental patient
checks out of here today,

34:36.275 --> 34:38.244
drives away with this thing,

34:38.277 --> 34:40.277
took it right
to its own home.

34:40.311 --> 34:42.748
Checked out today.

34:42.780 --> 34:44.949
Get me a list of all
patients discharged
in the last 24 hours.

34:44.983 --> 34:48.387
No. I know where it's goin'.
We've gotta move. Now!

34:48.420 --> 34:53.090
I'm gonna close my eyes,
and when I open them,
you are going to go away.

34:53.125 --> 34:55.693
-(screeching)
-(screaming)

34:57.429 --> 34:58.496
Get off me!

34:59.797 --> 35:00.965
(gasps)

35:07.373 --> 35:08.373
Oh! Oh...

35:13.978 --> 35:16.014
-(screeching)
-(screaming)

35:21.018 --> 35:22.420
Buffy!

35:22.454 --> 35:24.989
-(water running)
-(sobbing)

35:47.378 --> 35:49.347
Buffy!

35:57.356 --> 36:00.559
-What? What is it?
-There's something out there,
Buffy. It's after Mom.

36:00.592 --> 36:02.594
You guys stay in here.
Don't leave this room.

36:15.507 --> 36:18.244
It's okay, my baby.
It's okay.

37:06.458 --> 37:08.693
-Spike?
-Yeah.

37:08.726 --> 37:12.063
Listen, uh,
did you hear a noise?

37:12.097 --> 37:14.699
What the hell
are you doing in my house?

37:14.733 --> 37:17.735
Right, then. Caught me.

37:17.768 --> 37:21.773
Your basement's
full of junk, and me
being in need of, uh, junk--

37:21.806 --> 37:26.110
-You were stealing?
-Well, yeah. Can't exactly work
the counter at Burger Barn.

37:26.143 --> 37:28.146
Wait.
Are those pictures of me?

37:28.179 --> 37:30.481
(screaming)

37:46.965 --> 37:47.965
Buffy.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.641
(squealing)

38:04.014 --> 38:05.983
(squealing stops)

38:10.322 --> 38:12.791
(grunts)

38:17.862 --> 38:20.831
-Cover the room!
-We're in! Fan out!

38:20.865 --> 38:25.135
-Check the back!
-Clear!

38:25.170 --> 38:27.639
-You okay?
-We're clear!

38:27.672 --> 38:29.974
(Agent shouting)

38:30.007 --> 38:32.010
You just missed
a real nice time.

38:32.043 --> 38:33.244
AGENT:
Go, go!

38:38.048 --> 38:40.318
It's gone.
I killed it.

38:40.351 --> 38:43.221
-Oh, god.
-It's gone? You promise?

38:43.253 --> 38:46.358
I promise.

38:46.391 --> 38:48.259
Everything's all right.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.663
Everything's all right.

39:11.048 --> 39:15.253
It's strange. A body might ask
what exactly it is you think
you're doing.

39:15.286 --> 39:18.556
He might ask what all this
was meant to accomplish...

39:18.590 --> 39:21.159
because to a humble postulant,
it looks like chaos,

39:21.192 --> 39:25.431
like unnecessary attention
drawn where it ought not to be.

39:25.463 --> 39:27.733
Get out.

39:27.766 --> 39:29.701
Sir.

39:34.304 --> 39:38.543
Sir, forgive me.
I just want to understand.
Why summon the Queller?

39:38.577 --> 39:41.913
What do you think?
Because I'm cleaning up
Glory's mess,

39:41.947 --> 39:43.914
just like I've done
my whole damn life.

39:43.949 --> 39:45.784
(engine starts)

40:22.521 --> 40:27.492
Buffy, uh,
I wanna ask you something,

40:27.525 --> 40:32.163
and if I'm--
if I'm being crazy,
you just tell me, okay?

40:32.197 --> 40:35.634
You got it.

40:35.666 --> 40:37.735
The other day--

40:37.768 --> 40:40.237
Well, actually,
I'm not sure when.

40:40.271 --> 40:43.509
The days seem
to all bleed together.

40:44.976 --> 40:49.614
-It's not important.
-No, I guess it isn't.

40:49.648 --> 40:53.451
I do know I was
pretty out of it,

40:53.485 --> 40:56.186
and I had...

40:56.221 --> 40:59.657
Not-- not a dream exactly.

40:59.690 --> 41:02.793
More like I had
this knowledge.

41:02.827 --> 41:06.764
It just came to me
like truth, you know?

41:06.797 --> 41:11.302
Even though it
didn't seem possible,

41:11.335 --> 41:13.170
Even though I shouldn't
think such things.

41:13.204 --> 41:16.041
What?

41:16.074 --> 41:17.509
That Dawn--

41:20.978 --> 41:23.648
She's not mine, is she?

41:36.661 --> 41:38.563
No.

41:45.235 --> 41:48.706
She's--

41:48.739 --> 41:51.376
She does belong to us though.

41:53.844 --> 41:56.914
Yes, she does.

41:56.947 --> 42:01.052
And she's important
to the world. Precious.

42:02.688 --> 42:05.690
As precious as you are to me.

42:10.394 --> 42:13.498
Then we have to
take care of her.

42:13.530 --> 42:16.702
Buffy, promise me.
If anything happens,

42:16.735 --> 42:18.235
if I don't come
through this--
Mom--

42:18.268 --> 42:21.739
No. Listen to me.
No matter what she is,

42:21.773 --> 42:24.041
she still feels
like my daughter.

42:26.311 --> 42:28.413
I have to know that
you'll take care of her,

42:28.445 --> 42:30.447
that you'll keep her safe,

42:30.481 --> 42:33.652
that you'll love her
like I love you.

42:35.320 --> 42:38.889
-I promise.
-Good.

42:41.458 --> 42:43.393
Good.

42:44.795 --> 42:46.864
Oh.

42:46.898 --> 42:49.668
My sweet, brave Buffy.

42:51.501 --> 42:53.304
What would I do
without you?

43:54.733 --> 43:56.702
Grr! Arrgh!
