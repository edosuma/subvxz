15:43.722 --> 15:47.982

15:48.082 --> 15:53.703
I remember being so enthralled
by my English teacher.

15:53.803 --> 15:58.964

enthralling anyone, you know?

16:11.167 --> 16:12.987

'Sliding Doors' moment

16:13.087 --> 16:14.507

ballsed it up?

16:14.607 --> 16:15.908

even more hours,

16:16.008 --> 16:17.508

without even thinking about

16:19.208 --> 16:21.108

one painting when he died.

chased by one at Port Stephens

16:46.733 --> 16:47.753
when I was a kid.

16:47.853 --> 16:49.594

all the way to the car.

28:24.902 --> 28:26.642
Mr Ioane called me today.

28:26.742 --> 28:29.563
MO: Did he tell you
I was a shit captain?

28:29.663 --> 28:30.563
No.

28:30.663 --> 28:32.003
MAYA: They still won.

28:32.103 --> 28:33.764
MO: We actually forfeited.

28:33.864 --> 28:37.304
What? You were up, like,
four-nil. That's bullshit.

28:38.504 --> 28:40.505
What happened, MoMo?

28:41.025 --> 28:43.025
He actually killed it.

28:44.226 --> 28:46.926
Although probably
a good thing Dad wasn't there

28:47.026 --> 28:48.406
to see you go bitch mode.

28:48.506 --> 28:49.407
(MO CHUCKLES)

28:49.507 --> 28:51.507
It didn't sound all that funny.

28:52.667 --> 28:55.368
I'm sure if Dad was there
he would have been very proud.

28:55.468 --> 28:58.488
But he isn't, is he?

28:58.588 --> 29:01.009
He's never here.

29:01.109 --> 29:02.529
Well, he would if he could.

29:02.629 --> 29:03.889
Broken record much?

29:03.989 --> 29:05.930
Right, let's just enjoy
some fish and chips.

29:06.030 --> 29:07.450
But she's right.

29:07.550 --> 29:08.970
He's never gonna be here.

29:09.070 --> 29:11.571
-This isn't happening.
-Have you been at him?

29:11.671 --> 29:13.411
-It's actually obvious.
-No, it's just obvious.

29:13.511 --> 29:15.451
-OK.
-God, stop trying so hard.

29:15.551 --> 29:16.732
OK!

29:16.832 --> 29:18.852
You know, I can't
with you two sometimes!
