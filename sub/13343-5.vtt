WEBVTT

00:08.042 --> 00:10.211
Stuart:
Hi, I'm visiting 223.

00:16.050 --> 00:17.685
- Hey.
- Hello.

00:17.785 --> 00:20.254
- Come on in.
You're my first visitor.
- Yeah. Oh.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.123
Welcome
to Casa del Wade.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.557
Yeah, look at this.

00:23.657 --> 00:24.892
- I know, right?
- Yeah.

00:24.992 --> 00:26.594
It's so close
to the freeway.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.696
Yeah, I know.
You can hear it from here.

00:28.796 --> 00:32.266
It's not as nice
as my place with Marion,
but, you know, I like it.

00:32.366 --> 00:35.002
Actually, they call this
a "Sterling" apartment.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.837
Just the one
dining chair?

00:36.937 --> 00:38.639
Yeah. Yeah.

00:38.739 --> 00:41.109
I mean, if I need more,
I just let the property
manager know

00:41.209 --> 00:43.277
and he'll rustle some up
from the basement.

00:43.377 --> 00:46.147
It's like he says,
"Chairs when you need 'em,
not when you don't."

00:46.247 --> 00:48.015
- Right.
- ( laughs )

00:48.116 --> 00:52.052
Yeah, look at that.
And they've got the bed
sort of in the living room.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.887
Yeah, it kinda has
that New York loft feel.

00:53.987 --> 00:55.489
I suppose so.

00:55.589 --> 00:56.824
You don't tend to see a bed
that close to a kitchen,

00:56.924 --> 00:58.092
do you, normally?

00:58.192 --> 00:59.760
It's so convenient.
I love that.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.962
- Breakfast in bed.
- And dinner.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.598
I, uh-- I'll eat dinner
in there, too.

01:04.698 --> 01:07.000
That's the dream.

01:07.101 --> 01:09.237
You're gonna love this.

01:09.337 --> 01:11.572
Huh? Check it out.
It leads right to the pool.

01:13.941 --> 01:15.509
It's like I'm
living in a resort.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.211
Sort of.

01:17.311 --> 01:18.946
If I give 'em notice,
I can use this,

01:19.046 --> 01:20.848
- you know, for Cassidy's
birthday party...
- Wade.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.250
...barbecue-- what?

01:22.350 --> 01:24.084
Wade, can I borrow your
nail clippers again, please?

01:24.185 --> 01:25.819
Yeah, sure.
Can I get them
in a little bit?

01:25.919 --> 01:27.721
Uh, I'm about to shower,
and when the nails are soft,

01:27.821 --> 01:29.923
- they're so easy to cut.
- Wade: Yeah, I know--

01:30.023 --> 01:32.126
Guys, I'm gonna leave you
to have this conversation
in private,

01:32.226 --> 01:34.128
- but thanks
for showing me around.
- Wade: Yeah.

01:34.228 --> 01:35.529
And don't forget
the big party on Saturday.

01:35.629 --> 01:36.997
- Yes, I'll be there.
- Yeah? All right.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.266
Be there or be square,
my friend.

01:38.366 --> 01:40.701
You're having a party?
May I come?

01:40.801 --> 01:43.604
Um, I'm gonna say no,

01:43.704 --> 01:45.873
but only because
I've never met you before.

01:45.973 --> 01:48.676
- All right.
- See you later.

01:48.776 --> 01:51.879
* Just a little boy lost
looking for a lamb *

01:51.979 --> 01:54.548
* In the all-night city

01:54.648 --> 02:00.020
* Living in
his lonely limousine *

02:00.120 --> 02:03.257
* And though
he never has to worry *

02:03.357 --> 02:06.227
* He's the only one
and only one *

02:06.327 --> 02:08.162
* He's ever gonna need

02:08.262 --> 02:11.632
* Absolutely,
he's in definite need *

02:11.732 --> 02:15.569
* Ooh, maybe we've been
alone too long *

02:15.669 --> 02:18.606
* You don't
want to be lonely *

02:18.706 --> 02:21.409
* Maybe we've been
alone too long *

02:21.509 --> 02:26.314
* You don't want
to be lonely. *

02:40.261 --> 02:41.929
I love it.

02:42.029 --> 02:44.332
I absol-- it's brilliant.
I mean, it's just everything.

02:44.432 --> 02:46.934
It's classy,
it's intriguing, it's sexy,

02:47.034 --> 02:49.102
but it's not vulgar,
which is what the party's
gonna be like.

02:49.203 --> 02:50.804
- That's what I was
going for right there.
- Yeah, I can tell.

02:50.904 --> 02:52.873
I can tell, mate.
It's an absolute dynamite--

02:52.973 --> 02:54.542
Jessica, look at this.

02:54.642 --> 02:57.211
You're the first person
to receive an official invite

02:57.311 --> 02:58.679
to my pool party
of the century.

02:58.779 --> 03:01.081
- Gonna party
like it's 1999.
- Yep.

03:01.181 --> 03:04.952
"You are cordially invited
to an exclusive pool party
in the Hollywood Hills."

03:05.052 --> 03:08.088
- Yes, you are.
- Well, technically,
this is not the Hills.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.156
You should put
"the base of the Hills."

03:09.257 --> 03:10.591
This is the Hills,
all right?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.092
You can see the H
of the Hollywood sign
from here.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.361
Yeah, if you
stand on the roof.

03:13.461 --> 03:14.795
Why are you trying
to crap on this?

03:14.895 --> 03:16.096
You know I've always wanted
to be known as the guy

03:16.196 --> 03:17.498
who throws
the best parties in LA.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.433
The best parties
that are BYOB.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.901
- All night long.
- All night long.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.202
- Till the break of dawn.
- Till the early morn.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.104
Till the early morn.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.039
People are gonna be
talking about this for years
to come, you know what I mean?

03:26.139 --> 03:27.708
They're gonna be like,
"Were you at the first
ever Pritch party?

03:27.808 --> 03:29.810
It was-- I heard it was cool,
it was, like, epic."

03:29.910 --> 03:31.712
- "I heard it was
cool and epic."
- "Epic.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.647
There was, like, a girl
who just stripped off naked

03:33.747 --> 03:35.316
and just jumped in the pool
and people were like, 'What?'"

03:35.416 --> 03:37.050
"She slipped,
cracked her head.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.619
- There was, like,
blood everywhere."
- No, no, no, no.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.020
- "So crazy."
- No, no, no.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.589
Actually, put up
a sign that says,

03:41.689 --> 03:43.557
"No running by the pool"
because that could
be dangerous.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.526
Can you invite,
like, um, 20 people?

03:45.626 --> 03:47.728
No, I'm not gonna
invite a bunch of my
girlfriends over

03:47.828 --> 03:50.097
- just so you can hit on them.
- That's not what it's about.

03:50.197 --> 03:51.231
You can invite your dude
friends, if you want,

03:51.332 --> 03:53.301
as long as they
are hip and trendy.

03:53.401 --> 03:55.369
Ethnic would be great, too,
'cause I feel like we need
more diversity.

03:55.469 --> 03:56.770
Yeah, that'd be good.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.406
Can you drive me
to the soup kitchen, please?

03:58.506 --> 04:00.240
Can you invite
20 people to the party?

04:00.341 --> 04:01.542
No, I'm not doing that.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.444
Well, then, good luck
getting to the kitchen.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.212
- Ooh.
- ( laughs ) Burn.

04:05.313 --> 04:06.947
- It's a burn, baby.
- While we're partying.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.816
Party, party.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.084
Both:
Organizing a party.

04:11.184 --> 04:12.786
- Too low, too low.
- Ow!

04:12.886 --> 04:14.888
- Watch your head.
- Got it, got it, yeah.

04:14.988 --> 04:18.158
Hi, Ron.
How ya doing?

04:18.258 --> 04:20.294
There you go.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.963
Hello, Jackie.

04:23.063 --> 04:25.966
- There you go.
- Thank you.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.301
Hi.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.136
You're new here,
aren't you?

04:29.236 --> 04:30.604
My name's Jessica.
What's your name?

04:30.704 --> 04:32.573
- It's Heaven.
- Oh, Heaven.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.576
- That's a very pretty name.
- Thanks.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.049
Bye, guys.

04:50.891 --> 04:53.661
Hello again.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.763
Do you have
a place to sleep?

04:57.798 --> 04:59.333
No.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.234
I know you don't know me,

05:01.335 --> 05:04.438
but if you need a bed,
I have an air mattress.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.310
When you're
photographing the party,

05:10.411 --> 05:12.713
stylistically,
I'm thinking reportage.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.382
How do you feel
about black and white?

05:14.482 --> 05:15.649
( sighs )
I don't mind
black and white

05:15.749 --> 05:17.317
providing
it's not pretentious.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.286
- Preaching to the choir.
- This is Glenn.

05:19.387 --> 05:21.288
Hey, Glenn, it's Stuart
on speakerphone

05:21.389 --> 05:22.923
with my assistant, Rory.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.191
Who?

05:24.291 --> 05:27.027
- Rory?
- Glenn: No, who are you?

05:27.127 --> 05:29.262
Stuart.

05:29.363 --> 05:30.664
Pritchard.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.368
- Chicken wings?
- Chicken wings.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.936
What's going on, buddy?

05:36.036 --> 05:37.705
I'll tell you
what's up, mate.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.907
I am having,
at the weekend,
an epic pool party.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.476
It's gonna be a sort of
Playboy Mansion vibe.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.412
Who'd you hire
for bartenders?

05:44.512 --> 05:46.246
I don't know.
I'm not really
thinking bartenders.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.382
I was thinking
just keep it sort of DIY,

05:48.482 --> 05:50.518
bring your own alcohol.

05:50.618 --> 05:53.320
You know, like most
of the hip parties
are doing now.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.855
No, you should use
Runway Waiters.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.890
Smoking hot models
serving drinks.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.225
My buddy runs the place.

05:58.325 --> 05:59.460
Do you think
I could get a discount?

05:59.560 --> 06:01.328
- I don't think so.
- No?

06:01.429 --> 06:03.764
I'm just gonna
go into conference.
What do you think of that?

06:03.864 --> 06:05.933
I like it, I just don't
want to treat the models
like they're objects.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.868
- Definitely not. No, no, no.
- Dehumanize, you know
what I mean?

06:07.968 --> 06:09.670
No, no, no.
Not at all, not at all,
not at all.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.772
But hire the sexiest one
you can find.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.106
You got it.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.608
Glenn, it's Pritch,
I'm back.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.844
Listen, mate, could you
invite the sort of people

06:16.944 --> 06:19.813
that you'd expect to see
on, say, a yacht party
thrown by P. Diddy?

06:19.913 --> 06:21.549
But, like,
when he was relevant?

06:21.649 --> 06:24.718
'Cause I'm gonna be
pretty fixed for nerds.

06:24.818 --> 06:25.953
Sure.

06:28.255 --> 06:30.357
Stuart:
Glenn, I'm gonna have
to call you back, mate,

06:30.458 --> 06:32.325
'cause, um...

06:32.426 --> 06:34.061
there's a vagrant
in my backyard.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.134
Go away.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.236
This is private property.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.005
You're not welcome here.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.307
This is called
a mobile phone.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.677
I will call the police.

06:52.780 --> 06:55.483
Okay, relax, tough guy.
She's with me.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.951
Do you wanna just
go up to my guesthouse?

06:58.051 --> 07:00.120
- Hey, Angelina Jolie.
- ( snaps fingers )

07:00.220 --> 07:01.555
A little word here.
What's going on?

07:01.655 --> 07:02.956
- Who's this?
- She's just my friend.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.558
- Just your friend? Really?
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.460
Did you meet her
at the soup kitchen?

07:06.560 --> 07:08.261
She has
nowhere else to go.

07:08.361 --> 07:10.864
What, you invited her?
She's not staying.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.533
- Well--
- What are you, a maniac?

07:12.633 --> 07:14.502
She's probably a crackhead
or a hooker or something.

07:14.602 --> 07:17.070
No, she's not.
She is a very sweet girl
who just needs--

07:17.170 --> 07:18.572
- Really?
- Yes, she is.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.107
She just needs someone
to be kind to her

07:20.207 --> 07:21.742
for once in her life.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.477
Haven't you ever
felt the need

07:23.577 --> 07:25.679
to help someone
less fortunate than you?

07:25.779 --> 07:27.981
Yes, it's why I let you
live in my guesthouse.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.683
Oh, come on.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.218
I really want
to help this girl.

07:31.318 --> 07:32.686
- Do you?
- Yes.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.855
All right,
well, she can stay.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.057
But you'd better invite
at least 20 cool people
to my party.

07:37.157 --> 07:39.192
( groans )
Fine.

07:46.800 --> 07:47.968
Hiya.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.170
Hi, uh...

07:50.270 --> 07:53.140
I brought you some rosé

07:53.240 --> 07:57.310
just to say sorry again
for what happened at
Margot's dinner.

07:57.410 --> 07:59.880
Thank you.
That's very nice.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.481
I feel like maybe
I should apologize

08:01.582 --> 08:03.383
to some of the other people
that were at the dinner?

08:03.483 --> 08:05.719
I don't know if
you've got their numbers.
I could give them a call.

08:05.819 --> 08:09.056
Margot, your boyfriend,
the black guy--

08:09.156 --> 08:10.791
- Armand.
- Armand.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.861
Um, and I feel like there was--
was there a blonde lady,

08:13.961 --> 08:16.429
attractive,
who showed up at the end?

08:16.530 --> 08:18.198
Kimberly, yes.
She's one of my models.

08:18.298 --> 08:19.733
Is she a model?

08:21.034 --> 08:23.837
( phone rings )

08:23.937 --> 08:25.005
Hello?

08:25.105 --> 08:27.440
- Hi, is that Kimberly?
- This is her.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.710
- Hi, this is Stuart.
- Who?

08:29.810 --> 08:32.746
Stuart Pritchard.
I'm a dear friend of Andy's.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.749
We met very briefly
at Margot's dinner.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.586
Oh, yeah,
the very, very tall man.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.353
The tall guy, yeah.
( laughs )

08:40.453 --> 08:41.955
That's a good memory,
good memory.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.557
Sorry I had to take off
early that night.

08:43.657 --> 08:47.460
I actually volunteer
at a soup kitchen, so...

08:47.561 --> 08:50.163
- Are you a chef?
- I'm not a chef, no.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.499
Um, although cooking
is one of my passions.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.068
I also like theater
and socializing with friends.

08:55.168 --> 08:56.637
I actually make my money
owning and operating

08:56.737 --> 08:58.606
a successful
web design business.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.774
Oh, hey, mention that
we're making big strides
in CSS framework integration.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.243
Shh.
We're actually currently
making big strides

09:03.343 --> 09:04.511
in CSS framework
integration.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.179
Kimberly:
Oh, that's nice.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.649
Listen, I don't know
what you're doing Saturday,

09:08.749 --> 09:11.118
but I am having an epic
pool party in the Hills.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.586
I love parties.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.087
I went to this insane
party last night.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.789
The DJ was amazing.
You should hire him.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.925
He played
the best dubstep.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.459
This is weird 'cause
you could literally

09:19.559 --> 09:20.694
be describing
my party back to me.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.262
Write down "drubstep."

09:22.362 --> 09:24.131
I love "drubstep."

09:24.231 --> 09:26.566
So, do you think you
might be able to make it
to the party?

09:26.667 --> 09:28.535
Um, yeah.

09:28.636 --> 09:29.670
Can I bring a few people?

09:29.770 --> 09:31.271
Yeah, no, of course, yeah.

09:31.371 --> 09:34.808
Why don't I put you down
for, say, you know, plus 30?

09:34.908 --> 09:36.910
( laughs )
Okay, sounds good.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.111
See ya, bye.

09:38.211 --> 09:39.579
Bye.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.783
Oh, bit of bad news.

09:42.883 --> 09:45.152
- She's coming.
- Oh.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.620
Put that
in the bank savings.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.288
- Put that in the bank.
- For savings.

09:48.388 --> 09:49.923
And see the interest
accumulate.

09:50.023 --> 09:51.825
Cha-ching, cha-ching,
cha-ching. Oh, yes.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.293
Oh, you have
to hire a DJ ASAP.

09:53.393 --> 09:55.028
Done.
Now, for cleanup,

09:55.128 --> 09:57.998
do we want regular maids
or fantasy French maids?

09:58.098 --> 10:00.533
Oui, oui.
( speaks gibberish )

10:00.634 --> 10:02.569
We don't need maids.
You'll do the cleanup.

10:02.670 --> 10:04.604
Earth to Stuart,
we need cleaners.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.707
If only half the people come
we've invited,

10:06.807 --> 10:08.776
we'll have, like,
250 people in here.

10:08.876 --> 10:10.343
This place is gonna
be decimated.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.115
You know what I
suddenly realized?

10:15.215 --> 10:17.350
Why am I selfishly
having a party at my place

10:17.450 --> 10:18.886
to celebrate nothing

10:18.986 --> 10:20.821
when we should be
having a party here

10:20.921 --> 10:22.455
to celebrate
your beautiful new home?

10:22.555 --> 10:24.124
Yeah, I don't know.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.793
This is gonna be
the party of the century.
Honestly.

10:25.893 --> 10:28.595
We can just rent out
the pool downstairs.

10:28.696 --> 10:29.963
We're gonna have
the super cool dudes here.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.431
We're gonna have
the beautiful women.

10:31.531 --> 10:32.632
Yeah, no, I can't
be hanging out

10:32.733 --> 10:34.034
with beautiful
women every night.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.803
I mean, what's
Marion gonna say?

10:35.903 --> 10:37.404
This is what you want.
You want Marion worrying
about this.

10:37.504 --> 10:40.007
We'll take some pictures.
We'll put them on Facebook.

10:40.107 --> 10:42.409
- Marion will be all jealous.
- Jealous, she'll be begging
for you back.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.611
Yeah, you know, but a party
takes so much organization.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.246
Don't worry about it.
I got my best man on it.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.015
I got it.
I've been reading
a lot of books on parties.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.850
- And I got a spreadsheet.
- I don't know.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.952
- Come on.
- Please?

10:52.052 --> 10:53.253
Come on, Wade.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.224
- I'll do it.
- Both: He's in!

10:57.324 --> 10:58.591
Yeah, party committee!

10:58.692 --> 10:59.693
- Party committee!
- The party committee!

10:59.793 --> 11:01.328
- In full effect.
- Yeah.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.530
- And I got illegal fireworks.
- Fireworks. He's got fireworks.

11:03.630 --> 11:06.233
- No fireworks.
- No fireworks. We're not
doing fireworks. Come on.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.970
( music playing )

11:14.007 --> 11:16.009
How long have you
lived here?

11:16.109 --> 11:18.045
Uh, about
a year and a half.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.980
This place seems small
for someone your age.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.381
You don't even
have a kitchen.

11:21.481 --> 11:22.983
Oh, no, I have
a kitchen.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.351
Look.

11:26.586 --> 11:27.788
Ta-da.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.122
Heaven:
That's not a kitchen.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.924
That's a microwave
behind a sheet.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.360
Oh, well,
I don't really--

11:33.460 --> 11:34.995
I don't cook that much.

11:36.964 --> 11:38.698
Do you have
any weed or pills?

11:38.799 --> 11:40.868
Why do you need drugs?

11:40.968 --> 11:42.836
I just need something
to take the edge off.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.938
Take the edge off of what?

11:45.038 --> 11:46.974
You're not really
doing anything.

11:47.074 --> 11:50.710
Hey, how about
we sit together

11:50.811 --> 11:52.412
and work on your resume?

11:52.512 --> 11:54.047
Nah, I don't wanna do that.

11:54.147 --> 11:56.750
You know, I could help you
get a job, if you'd let me.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.086
( groans )
You sound like
my fucking mother.

12:03.123 --> 12:06.459
Can you turn
that shitty music off?

12:06.559 --> 12:08.161
No, this is--
this is beautiful music,

12:08.261 --> 12:09.830
and it inspires me.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.431
Well, I'm trying
to take a nap.

12:11.531 --> 12:12.966
Okay, sure, yeah.
We'll just--

12:13.066 --> 12:15.135
( music volume decreases )

12:33.887 --> 12:35.355
That's a lot of booze.

12:35.455 --> 12:36.790
'Course it is, mate.
Gonna be a lot
of people here.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.691
Here he is,
beat master general.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.060
( mimics record scratch )

12:40.160 --> 12:41.862
Keeping
the beats fresh, yeah?

12:41.962 --> 12:43.296
If you've got any
white label stuff or demos,

12:43.396 --> 12:44.865
don't be afraid
to throw them in.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.066
You know, that guy
sometimes plays outside Vegas.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.301
- No.
- Yeah, at a little club.

12:48.401 --> 12:51.038
- Hey, what is this?
- What is this, indeed.
The VIP section, all right?

12:51.138 --> 12:53.073
You can only get in here
if you've got one of
these bracelets.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.842
- Oh.
- Take a bunch.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.576
And we're only giving these
out to the cream of the crop.

12:56.676 --> 12:59.146
People with the "it" factor.
I'm talking actresses,
models, natch.

12:59.246 --> 13:02.015
Musicians, any kind of
local businessmen.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.451
- Cool.
- Better sign this.

13:04.551 --> 13:07.287
( giggling, screaming )

13:07.387 --> 13:09.923
What's going on here?
I booked the pool.

13:10.023 --> 13:13.493
Oi, kid.
Who's in charge here?

13:13.593 --> 13:15.095
Hello.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.230
Who organized
this little shindig?

13:20.133 --> 13:21.734
Is there anybody in there?

13:21.835 --> 13:23.170
Are you a little bit simple?

13:23.270 --> 13:25.772
You just roam
the land unsupervised?

13:25.873 --> 13:28.175
- Can I help you?
- Possibly, yeah.

13:28.275 --> 13:31.244
I actually booked
the pool from 3:00.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.246
It's now 3:15

13:33.346 --> 13:36.783
- and you've got
the young 'uns at play.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.718
Yeah.

13:38.818 --> 13:43.323
The only problem is
that I'm having quite
a "adults only" party.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.258
And I'm just concerned
about the kids

13:45.358 --> 13:47.494
seeing some of the shit
that's gonna go down.

13:47.594 --> 13:48.929
I don't see any guests.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.463
You don't see any guests
at the moment, no.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.265
You don't at the moment,
but they are on the way,

13:52.365 --> 13:55.068
and we are talking actresses,
we're talking models,

13:55.168 --> 13:56.769
we're talking
actors and musicians,

13:56.870 --> 13:58.939
so, as I say, it could be
a little bit X-rated,

13:59.039 --> 14:01.108
- if you catch my drift.
- Oh, I do.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.676
I promise we'll get out
when your guests arrive.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.212
- How's that?
- Okay, that seems reasonable.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.080
- Good? Okay. All right.
- All right.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.382
She is being
completely unreasonable

14:09.482 --> 14:11.284
and refusing to get
out of the pool.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.220
What are the rules,
you know what I mean?

14:13.320 --> 14:14.922
- Right.
- Like, if we don't
have a system in place,

14:15.022 --> 14:16.323
- society collapses, right?
- Uh-huh, sure.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.291
You know what I mean?
And I don't know

14:18.391 --> 14:21.128
if there's a way
you could maybe have
a word with her.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.163
Yeah,
I could chat with her.

14:23.263 --> 14:24.864
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, no, I don't
blame you at all,

14:24.965 --> 14:27.100
but could you not
let anyone into the party

14:27.200 --> 14:28.601
who doesn't have one of
these official invites?

14:28.701 --> 14:30.003
- Okay.
- All right?

14:30.103 --> 14:31.238
So unless they're
carrying one of those,

14:31.338 --> 14:32.739
please just
don't let them in.

14:32.839 --> 14:34.507
You guys
put on sunblock?

14:34.607 --> 14:35.875
Yeah, I put on
two layers.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.378
Pardon me, excuse me.
Can I have a quick word?

14:38.478 --> 14:40.147
Yeah, yeah.

14:40.247 --> 14:43.350
- Who's this lot?
- What? They're
other residents.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.852
They're not really
the sort of people we're
after, mate, at this party.

14:45.953 --> 14:47.120
They're sort of
lowering the tone a bit.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.089
What-- no,
they're good guys.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.324
I mean, Barry's
also separated.
Clive's a widower.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.193
A widower?

14:53.293 --> 14:55.262
I don't want him
droning on to some model
about his dead wife.

14:55.362 --> 14:58.398
He never talks about her.
No one does.

14:58.498 --> 15:02.169
( sighs )
You should check
with me before--

15:04.737 --> 15:06.606
- Oi.
- Yeah?

15:06.706 --> 15:07.840
- Hello.
- Hi.

15:07.941 --> 15:09.076
- How's it going?
- Good.

15:09.176 --> 15:10.443
Who the fuck are you?

15:10.543 --> 15:12.379
I'm from Runway Waiters.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.347
Of course you are.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.449
- Rory?
- Yeah?

15:16.549 --> 15:18.118
This gentleman says
he's from Runway Waiters.

15:18.218 --> 15:19.419
Yep, you asked me
to hire someone.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.254
Yes, I did. I asked you
to hire someone, yeah.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.991
And what made you think
that I'd want a man,
not a woman?

15:24.091 --> 15:25.458
You didn't
specify a gender.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.794
Why would I want
a better-looking bloke
than me here?

15:27.894 --> 15:29.096
Because he's the eye candy!

15:29.196 --> 15:31.598
Eye candy for who?
We should be the eye candy.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.233
For everybody.
Are you kidding?

15:33.333 --> 15:35.002
Look at this guy.
He's like a slice
of heaven.

15:35.102 --> 15:36.636
Yeah, he's
a good-looking blo--

15:36.736 --> 15:38.738
I don't want-- delete that.
I don't want a picture of him.

15:38.838 --> 15:40.307
I don't want a picture
of me with him.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.009
And you, put
a bloody shirt on.
Come on.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.410
I think I have one
in my car.

15:43.510 --> 15:44.844
What do you mean,
you think you have one--

15:44.944 --> 15:47.280
who comes out
without a shirt?

15:47.380 --> 15:49.516
Thanks for
putting the pants on.
That was nice of you.

15:50.817 --> 15:51.985
( mattress squeaks )

15:52.085 --> 15:53.520
( laughs )

15:57.290 --> 15:59.092
( laughing continues )

15:59.192 --> 16:01.328
( continues squeaking )

16:01.428 --> 16:02.929
Can you stop
doing that, please?

16:03.030 --> 16:06.099
You need to relax.
You're so uptight.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.804
- ( squeaks )
- ( sighs )

16:11.904 --> 16:14.107
What? Sorry.

16:15.775 --> 16:18.411
( laughs )

16:18.511 --> 16:21.281
( music playing )

16:25.785 --> 16:27.087
You live here, do ya?

16:27.187 --> 16:29.922
Yeah?
Wade invite ya?
Good, welcome.

16:30.023 --> 16:32.392
- Let me get you guys.
- Don't take a-- I don't want
a picture with them.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.694
- Just delete that.
- Okay, my bad.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.897
Have you had any
emails or anything?

16:37.997 --> 16:39.632
Texts? People just
confirming the address?

16:39.732 --> 16:41.401
- No.
- No?

16:41.501 --> 16:43.703
We were told there were
gonna be hot girls here.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.738
The hot girls
will be here, mate.
Don't worry.

16:45.838 --> 16:49.008
Just so you know,
if they don't show,
I might take off.

16:49.109 --> 16:52.512
Well, let's hope
that doesn't happen.

16:52.612 --> 16:55.148
Right out the gate, all right?
You're not coming back.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.184
Through the gate, guys.

16:57.284 --> 16:58.718
I'm just working
this middle-age gay party--

16:58.818 --> 16:59.986
It's not
a middle-age gay party.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.288
Where are you
getting that from?

17:01.388 --> 17:03.223
Well,
I just thought, uh...

17:06.759 --> 17:09.162
It's all dudes,
and you have a giant
ice dick.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.531
Stuart:
I've got giant
ice tits as well,

17:11.631 --> 17:13.333
so your whole theory's
shot, isn't it?

17:14.967 --> 17:16.869
Seriously,
you told on us?

17:16.969 --> 17:18.871
I did tell on you, yes,
because I told you

17:18.971 --> 17:20.440
I booked the pool from 3:00.
I told you that.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.475
Will you stop
pointing at me?

17:26.179 --> 17:27.347
Unbelievable.

17:27.447 --> 17:28.748
Well, you're paying
for a new one.

17:28.848 --> 17:29.849
You're paying
for a new one.

17:29.949 --> 17:31.584
Have a fun party,
asshole.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.686
Oh, really?
This is the language
we're using, is it,

17:33.786 --> 17:35.088
in front of the kids?

17:35.188 --> 17:36.823
No wonder they're
fucking delinquents.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.407
( sighs )
Are you done with this?

17:54.507 --> 17:56.843
Oh, yeah,
you can take it.

17:56.943 --> 17:58.711
Wait, there's
one more chip.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.614
Okay.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.453
- Hey, no, no, no.
- ( lighter clicks )

18:06.553 --> 18:08.188
Can you not
smoke in here, please?

18:08.288 --> 18:11.924
Mm, can you not be
a total fascist?

18:12.024 --> 18:13.426
( Heaven drops lighter )

18:16.028 --> 18:17.997
( sighs )

18:18.097 --> 18:19.266
Here's the thing.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.401
If it were up to me,

18:21.501 --> 18:24.171
I would want you
to stay here forever,

18:24.271 --> 18:26.139
but my landlord,

18:26.239 --> 18:28.241
he said you can't
stay here anymore.

18:28.341 --> 18:31.944
- What a fucking asshole.
- I know, right?

18:32.044 --> 18:34.381
But I can find you
a bed at a shelter.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.283
I don't like those places.

18:36.383 --> 18:38.185
They smell like shit
and they're full of
crazy bitches.

18:38.285 --> 18:39.852
I want to stay here.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.488
Yeah, no, I know,

18:41.588 --> 18:43.890
and, honestly, I would
want you to stay here.

18:43.990 --> 18:46.826
- Tight.
- But it is his house, so...

18:46.926 --> 18:49.829
( sighs )
We should probably
pack your things.

18:53.266 --> 18:55.067
* Get dirty

18:55.168 --> 18:56.969
* Get dirty

18:57.069 --> 18:58.705
* Get dirty

18:58.805 --> 19:00.607
* Get dirty

19:00.707 --> 19:01.674
* Get dirty...

19:01.774 --> 19:03.643
Oh, hey, Pritch.
Charles Manson just called.

19:03.743 --> 19:06.078
He wants to know
if he should come over
and lighten the mood.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.847
Impossible
'cause he's in jail,

19:07.947 --> 19:09.782
so...

19:09.882 --> 19:11.918
* Get dirty

19:12.018 --> 19:13.753
* Get dirty...

19:15.355 --> 19:17.190
- Hello, ladies.
- Hi.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.259
- Welcome.
- Is this Glenn's party?

19:19.359 --> 19:21.761
No, it's my party,
but Glenn's a friend
of mine,

19:21.861 --> 19:24.231
he's a good friend,
so he'll be along later.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.432
Um, Stuart, pleasure.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.200
- Brittany.
- Nice to meet you.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.268
- Lexi, nice to meet you.
- Lexi. Lexi and Brittany.

19:28.368 --> 19:29.436
Brittany and Lexi.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.504
I hope you brought
your bikinis

19:31.604 --> 19:34.274
'cause it's gonna get
pretty wild in here.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.478
Later.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.214
Maybe a drink
from the ice luge?

19:41.314 --> 19:42.515
- Sure, all right.
- Yeah?

19:42.615 --> 19:44.517
What's your poison,
cock or tits?

19:44.617 --> 19:45.918
Ladies,
I'm your bartender, Tim.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.654
- Hi.
- Pleasure.

19:47.754 --> 19:50.223
- Hi.
- So, was this
modeled off of you?

19:50.323 --> 19:51.924
Well, if I tell you,
I'd have to kill you.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.726
( both laugh )

19:53.826 --> 19:55.094
Not really a joke, but...

19:55.194 --> 19:57.430
- Is vodka okay?
- That's my favorite.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.533
- Yeah, it is.
- ( both laugh )

20:00.633 --> 20:02.502
All right.
I'm ready for it.

20:02.602 --> 20:03.536
I bet you are.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.037
You know,
I can handle you both.

20:05.137 --> 20:06.739
I bet you can.

20:06.839 --> 20:10.209
You know what?
I saw someone earlier
drinking from that

20:10.310 --> 20:11.544
and I think they
had a cold sore.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.045
- Ew.
- Yeah, I just remembered.

20:13.145 --> 20:14.814
You should've
flagged that up, really.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.083
- Why don't you get us
some house cocktails...
- Yeah.

20:17.183 --> 20:18.885
and I'll show you
around, ladies.

20:18.985 --> 20:20.287
All right.

20:22.121 --> 20:24.223
No more talking
to the female guests.

20:26.092 --> 20:29.729
Isn't this DJ fantastic?
He's from very near Vegas.

20:29.829 --> 20:33.966
Stop ogling.
They're not slabs of meat.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.868
Hi, I'm Kives.

20:35.968 --> 20:36.969
- Hi, Kives.
- Hi.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.605
Hop on in.
The water is delicious.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.873
- Maybe later.
- All right.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.076
Maybe not.

20:44.176 --> 20:45.945
Pathetic.

20:46.045 --> 20:47.614
If you haven't
brought bikinis,

20:47.714 --> 20:49.449
there is some talk
of skinny-dipping.

20:49.549 --> 20:50.583
Let me get you
some loungers.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.485
Excuse me.
This is VIP only.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.387
Up you come.
Up you come,
quick as you can.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.556
No, no, stay, stay.
They're fine.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.858
Stay. Stay.
As you were.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.427
Mm.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.495
Thank you, boy.
You may go.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.364
Lexi:
Mm, this is so good.

21:04.464 --> 21:06.098
- Can I get the recipe?
- Sure, yeah.

21:06.198 --> 21:07.567
- Just give me
your email--
- Yeah.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.336
Do you know what?
Can we do that in a second?

21:09.436 --> 21:11.170
Because I need you
to run along and get
a mop and a bucket

21:11.270 --> 21:13.506
'cause someone just threw up
in the disabled toilet,
all right?

21:13.606 --> 21:15.442
- So, off you go.
- Bye.

21:15.542 --> 21:17.310
Sorry, was
he bothering you?

21:17.410 --> 21:19.245
- No, no, no.
He's totally fine.
- Okay, good.

21:19.346 --> 21:21.013
Mm. Cheers, everyone.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.915
You know what?
Actually, we have to go.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.584
You just got here.

21:24.684 --> 21:28.087
I know.
We promised we'd go
to this other thing,

21:28.187 --> 21:29.188
but thank you so much.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.657
Let me get you
a different drink.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.592
Or I'll tell you what,
I could change the music.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.661
Honestly, everything's fine,
but we have to go.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.396
What about drugs?
Are you a fan of drugs?

21:36.496 --> 21:38.531
I could maybe rustle up
some cocaine or something?

21:38.631 --> 21:40.767
- Is that your thing?
- No, seriously.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.068
We have to go.

21:42.168 --> 21:44.471
All right, then.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.007
Oh.

21:48.107 --> 21:49.409
Whoo-whoo!

21:49.509 --> 21:52.679
That's the guy.
The man of the house.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.113
Did you get any of me
with the girls?

21:54.213 --> 21:56.048
Oh, I got a great shot
of them,

21:56.148 --> 21:58.017
and I got some of you,
so I'll just Photoshop
you guys together.

21:58.117 --> 21:59.085
Easy.

22:04.190 --> 22:05.958
( chattering )

22:12.131 --> 22:14.701
I'm gonna take off,
all right?

22:14.801 --> 22:16.503
- What?
- Yeah.

22:16.603 --> 22:19.305
You can't leave yet.
We're about to start
the Jenga tournament.

22:19.406 --> 22:21.474
That's why I am leaving.

22:21.574 --> 22:23.275
There's not
supposed to be Jenga.

22:23.376 --> 22:25.712
It's supposed
to be like a party
at the Playboy Mansion.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.714
The only hot girls
have already left.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.181
Hey, I'm sorry
if we're not all

22:29.281 --> 22:31.551
blonde bimbos
with fake tits.

22:31.651 --> 22:34.487
That's sweet of you to say,
but it's not your fault.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.789
I was being sarcastic.

22:37.957 --> 22:38.991
Yeah, sure.

22:39.091 --> 22:40.493
Sorry, apologies,
all right?

22:40.593 --> 22:42.795
I just-- I had ideas about
what this party could be

22:42.895 --> 22:46.032
and it's just--
it's not, so...

22:47.534 --> 22:49.502
enjoy, stay,
drink, have fun.

22:49.602 --> 22:51.671
And thanks for coming.

23:13.025 --> 23:16.763
- ( girls giggling )
- ( music playing )

23:28.641 --> 23:30.977
Hey, how come
you're not at the party?

23:31.077 --> 23:32.512
Oh, it's full of losers.

23:32.612 --> 23:34.246
Well, how come
you're not there?

23:34.346 --> 23:35.982
Not tonight.

23:36.082 --> 23:39.118
Fuck you, fucking
googly-eyed beanpole cunt.

23:41.488 --> 23:42.789
What?

23:42.889 --> 23:44.123
Drugs.

23:46.025 --> 23:48.661
- ( music playing )
- ( chattering )

23:56.002 --> 23:58.671
Uh, sorry, ladies.
I'm gonna have to
stop you there.

23:58.771 --> 24:01.240
I'm gonna need
to see some ID.

24:01.340 --> 24:03.075
Kidding. I'm Kives.
Nice to meet you.

24:03.175 --> 24:04.777
- Oh, hi.
- There are my boys.
This is Wade, this is Rory.

24:04.877 --> 24:06.278
- Say hi.
- Hi, guys.
I'm Kimberly.

24:06.378 --> 24:07.914
- Kimberly, hi.
- Hi, this is Megan.

24:08.014 --> 24:10.483
- Megan, pleasure.
- Have you guys seen
Stuart anywhere?

24:10.583 --> 24:12.218
Yeah, I think he's
in the bathroom throwing up.

24:12.318 --> 24:13.853
Have either one
of you ladies

24:13.953 --> 24:15.622
ever been with
another woman before?

24:15.722 --> 24:17.990
( laughs )
Oh, Megan, look.
It's ice tits.

24:19.659 --> 24:21.227
Before you do that,
hold on.

24:21.327 --> 24:22.862
Would you take a picture
with Wade here?

24:22.962 --> 24:24.463
We're trying to make
his wife jealous.

24:24.564 --> 24:26.232
Wade, get in there.

24:26.332 --> 24:27.634
- Get in there.
Gonna take a picture.
- Come on. Come on.

24:27.734 --> 24:29.301
- Come on.
- I'm sorry.

24:29.401 --> 24:30.803
Wade, get close, get close.
Get closer.

24:30.903 --> 24:33.239
- That's--
- One, two, three!

24:33.339 --> 24:35.742
- Yes!
- Oh, thank you.
Thanks, girls.

24:37.143 --> 24:39.546
You have my email address
if you ever need anything.

24:39.646 --> 24:42.649
Like advice
or whatever.

24:44.050 --> 24:45.184
Okay.

24:50.489 --> 24:51.791
Good luck.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.666
Heaven?

25:04.571 --> 25:06.806
Did you steal
my iPhone?

25:06.906 --> 25:08.274
No.

25:08.374 --> 25:10.610
Heaven...

25:10.710 --> 25:12.411
I don't want to start
a whole thing with you

25:12.511 --> 25:14.881
because I know that--

25:14.981 --> 25:16.182
oh, whoops.

25:17.383 --> 25:18.685
Here it is.
I'm sorry.

25:18.785 --> 25:20.219
I never use this pocket.

25:22.989 --> 25:25.424
You know what?
Here's $10.

25:25.524 --> 25:29.161
Don't spend it all
on drugs, okay?

25:29.261 --> 25:31.097
Buy some food, too.

25:33.499 --> 25:35.034
( beeps )

25:39.939 --> 25:42.842
You've got
to be shitting me.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.381
Hiya, I'm here
for the party.

25:49.481 --> 25:52.384
- Can I see your invitation?
- Oh, I haven't got
an invitation.

25:52.484 --> 25:54.353
I can't let you in
without one of these.

25:54.453 --> 25:55.855
Yeah, I know the policy.
I made the policy.

25:55.955 --> 25:57.790
I made the invitation
as well. It's my party.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.491
I was here about
two minutes ago.
I just left.

25:59.592 --> 26:01.594
- Can I see your residence ID?
- I haven't got a residence ID.

26:01.694 --> 26:03.495
I wouldn't live here.
I mean, I don't live here.

26:03.596 --> 26:06.165
- A friend of mine
has got a place here.
- Well, call your friend.

26:06.265 --> 26:07.934
I can't call my friend
'cause one of your
other residents

26:08.034 --> 26:09.301
threw my phone
in the swimming pool
earlier.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.137
Where were you then?

26:11.237 --> 26:14.674
I can't let you in
without an invitation
or a residence ID.

26:14.774 --> 26:16.643
- I don't make the rules.
- I do make the rules, though.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.410
I'm telling you.
What are the rules?

26:18.510 --> 26:20.179
It's just--
just ignore the rules.

26:20.279 --> 26:21.914
Please reverse your car.

26:23.149 --> 26:24.684
Thanks!

26:37.797 --> 26:40.099
* Who draws the crowd
and plays so loud? *

26:40.199 --> 26:44.637
* Baby,
it's the guitar man *

26:44.737 --> 26:46.472
* Who's gonna
steal the show? *

26:46.572 --> 26:50.376
* You know, baby,
it's the guitar man *

26:50.476 --> 26:53.813
* He can make you love

26:53.913 --> 26:56.849
* He can make you cry

26:56.949 --> 27:00.552
- * He will bring...
- Wade! Kives!

27:00.653 --> 27:03.856
- * He'll get you high...
- Glenn!

27:03.956 --> 27:07.526
* Something keeps him going

27:07.626 --> 27:09.929
* Miles and miles a day...

27:10.029 --> 27:11.998
Please climb down
from the fence.

27:12.098 --> 27:13.933
This is--
this is my party.

27:14.033 --> 27:16.035
Sir, climb down
from the fence now.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.704
No, but this is my party.
Seriously.

27:17.804 --> 27:20.606
Last time I'm telling you.
Climb down now.

27:20.707 --> 27:24.310
* Listen to
the guitar man *

27:24.410 --> 27:27.513
* Then he comes to town

27:27.613 --> 27:30.750
* And you see his face

27:30.850 --> 27:34.486
* And you think
you might *

27:34.586 --> 27:38.224
* Like to
take his place *

27:38.324 --> 27:41.560
* Something
keeps him driftin' *

27:41.660 --> 27:44.764
* Miles and miles away

27:44.864 --> 27:49.301
* Searching
for the songs to play *

27:51.637 --> 27:53.405
Whoo!

28:06.352 --> 28:09.722
* He can make you love

28:09.822 --> 28:12.792
* He can get you high

28:12.892 --> 28:16.228
* He will bring you down

28:16.328 --> 28:19.899
* And he'll make,
make you cry *

28:19.999 --> 28:22.935
* But he never
seems to notice *

28:23.035 --> 28:28.741
* He's just got to find
another place to play *

28:32.845 --> 28:36.248
* Either way

28:39.551 --> 28:42.955
* Got to play...
