00:12.760 --> 00:15.960
SEVILLE, SPAIN

00:29.880 --> 00:32.000
Today's a really important game.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.400
Portugal plays Belgium,

00:33.480 --> 00:37.360
and going from the round of 16
to the quarter finals is at stake.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.440
We're going to a restaurant
that Edu loves.

00:39.520 --> 00:40.720
The best one in Sevilla.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.120
He took us there the first time
we came to Sevilla

00:43.199 --> 00:45.199
to the MTV Awards and we love it.

00:45.760 --> 00:48.599
Sevilla brings back
such wonderful memories

00:48.680 --> 00:51.199
because two years ago,
I hosted the MTV Awards.

00:51.879 --> 00:55.520
Cristiano came with me.
It was the first time we switched roles.

00:56.080 --> 00:59.160
I was on stage,
and he was watching me from the stands.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.760
A special color.

01:02.360 --> 01:05.200
- Sing better, please--
- Sevilla still has its charm.

01:11.600 --> 01:14.680
Hey, if I ever want to be a singer,
you've already ruined my career.

01:14.759 --> 01:16.520
Sing it out loud! It doesn't matter.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.840
You can dance,
you can do a million things.

01:18.920 --> 01:20.600
You don't need to be a singer.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.960
"Mosingtress" as Elena calls me.

01:23.040 --> 01:25.119
"Mosingtress." Model…

01:25.200 --> 01:27.080
- Is it coming out?
- No, it doesn't.

01:27.920 --> 01:29.800
I love to sing, yes.

01:29.880 --> 01:32.600
Whether I'm good or bad at it,
that's another thing.

01:45.640 --> 01:46.720
ALTOZANO SQUARE

01:49.720 --> 01:52.080
- Well, guys, to Gio.
- Thanks for inviting us.

01:52.160 --> 01:55.679
Thank you so much for always
inviting us to your awesome getaways.

01:55.759 --> 01:58.080
Here's to Portugal winning,
and let's enjoy.

02:04.679 --> 02:07.199
I don't think I've ever been
in the front line of battle with you.

02:07.280 --> 02:09.039
- I've never been.
- Front row, it's cool.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.600
Well, at tennis when a ball hit me
in my head?

02:11.680 --> 02:13.680
Cris tried to stop it from hitting me,
but it hit me.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.519
I've had this gift,
since I was a little child,

02:16.600 --> 02:17.960
to be hit by balls.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.320
Five minutes into the game,
there came the ball straight at me.

02:21.400 --> 02:24.120
Sure, with his reflexes,
he was able to stop it,

02:24.200 --> 02:25.360
but it bounced on my head.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.200
But he stopped it anyway.
It just bounced off me.

02:28.280 --> 02:31.200
Today, if everything goes well,
Los Rebujitos are coming.

02:31.280 --> 02:33.440
If you've arranged for it,
they might not come.

02:33.519 --> 02:34.760
Right.

02:35.560 --> 02:36.799
We were in Portugal on holidays

02:36.880 --> 02:39.640
and I thought I could call a band,
Los Rebujitos,

02:39.720 --> 02:41.840
and give Cristiano and Gio a surprise.

02:43.880 --> 02:46.360
I'd thrown a party for Cristiano
with Portuguese singers,

02:46.440 --> 02:49.519
and I thought,
"Well, since all us Spaniards are here,

02:49.600 --> 02:51.480
let's give Cris a concert with…"

02:51.560 --> 02:53.160
The Spanish touch.

02:53.239 --> 02:55.720
Julia said, "Damn, I love Los Rebujitos,"
and so on.

02:55.799 --> 02:58.720
And I said, "I know them because
they played on <i>El Chiringuito</i> and stuff."

02:58.799 --> 03:01.000
I stepped up and said, "I'll handle this."

03:01.080 --> 03:04.000
Los Rebujitos said, "Okay, great, yeah."
They said they would come.

03:04.080 --> 03:07.280
So on Saturday, when there was the dinner,
I started talking to them.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.600
4:00 in the afternoon,
5:00 in the afternoon…

03:09.679 --> 03:12.080
They were coming from Cádiz,
and we were in Portugal.

03:12.160 --> 03:14.239
We all said, "Edu, what's wrong?"

03:14.320 --> 03:16.280
"They're not coming.
They're not coming."

03:16.360 --> 03:19.560
"They were mistaken.
They thought it was some other week."

03:19.640 --> 03:21.799
"They've told me they're not coming.
What do we do?"

03:21.880 --> 03:24.840
- I don't believe you.
- "This can't be happening."

03:24.920 --> 03:26.120
But dinner was the worst part.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.040
Since the dinner started,
she started to chew me out.

03:29.120 --> 03:31.280
It was like we were sitting
just as we are now.

03:31.799 --> 03:34.000
You don't know what it's like
to have together Georgina,

03:34.080 --> 03:35.320
Paixão, Toni…

03:36.480 --> 03:38.399
In the end, it did the job,

03:38.480 --> 03:41.560
because we were absolutely laughing
all night long.

03:41.640 --> 03:44.040
- It's what he does.
- The only one who was quiet? Cris.

03:44.119 --> 03:47.160
Cris. He was the only one
to calm things down.

03:47.239 --> 03:50.440
- "Get me a double."
- He was. The only one to calm things down.

03:50.519 --> 03:52.799
He did but then Paixão
goes to him like this and tells him,

03:52.880 --> 03:55.399
- "Keep pushing." "Keep pushing."

04:03.000 --> 04:04.359
Los Rebujitos!

04:08.839 --> 04:10.519
- Hello there.
- Oh, yeah!

04:11.040 --> 04:13.079
- Cheers, cheers, cheers!

04:13.160 --> 04:14.399
Of course, of course.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.200
- How are you?
- Welcome, dammit.

04:18.279 --> 04:19.959
That's like Irune on Instagram.

04:20.039 --> 04:22.440
- Welcome, guys.
- A pleasure, a pleasure.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.039
How are you doing in Seville? Good?

04:24.120 --> 04:26.880
Good, right?
Okay, so let's play some music.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.320
- Right? Live, right?
- Quality music.

04:28.400 --> 04:31.520
We have a thorn in our side
from last time, okay?

04:31.599 --> 04:33.880
Anyway, thank you for not coming

04:33.960 --> 04:36.720
because you gave us material
to roast Edu all year long.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.200
- To roast?
- They blamed me.

04:38.280 --> 04:40.560
- Let's go for a while, okay?
- Yeah, let's go.

04:42.919 --> 04:45.599
I fulfilled my dream
of bringing Los Rebujitos,

04:45.680 --> 04:48.760
so there will be no more jokes
about not having brought them a year ago.

04:48.840 --> 04:49.720
In Portugal.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.240
Let's go with this song.

04:51.880 --> 04:55.960
I wrote it during a sunset in Tarifa.
Let's see if it turns you on.

04:56.039 --> 04:57.479
Oh, I'm dying! I'm dying--

04:57.560 --> 04:59.599
The beach he was on
the day he stood us up.

04:59.680 --> 05:02.720
- The beach I was on. The same.
- The very same beach.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.240
I'm so nervous.

05:04.320 --> 05:06.320
- Oh, I'm dying. This is the one?
- Yes.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.520
I mean, I'm dying, I'm dying.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.960
Oh, I'm dying, I swear!

05:24.919 --> 05:27.919
- Let's go!
- Let's dance!

05:40.400 --> 05:42.280
Hit it ! Hit it!Hit it!

05:59.080 --> 06:00.479
Olé! Come on!

06:00.560 --> 06:02.919
Olé!

06:03.800 --> 06:04.720
Bravo!

06:04.800 --> 06:06.840
- Let's go! Let's go.
- You gypsy!

06:10.000 --> 06:15.240
I got carried away. I couldn't help it.
The joy made my voice want to shine.

06:31.160 --> 06:33.520
I'm nervous. I want them to win.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.919
I want them to get to the quarter finals,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.640
and I want them to win
the European Championship.

06:43.720 --> 06:44.599
Hello.

06:46.799 --> 06:50.560
Today's game against Belgium is decisive.

06:50.640 --> 06:52.160
At the end of the day, um,

06:52.240 --> 06:53.840
you either go home or you move forward.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.080
This is as tense as it gets.

06:59.039 --> 07:01.120
<i>Ladies and gentlemen…</i>

07:03.680 --> 07:04.760
I'm "nervious."

07:04.840 --> 07:07.960
- Are you "nervious," Gio?
I'm "nervious."

07:08.039 --> 07:09.720
- "Nervious"?
- "Nervious"?

07:09.799 --> 07:11.080
What will the score be?

07:11.160 --> 07:13.120
- What was your bet?
- I said 2-0 Portugal.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.200
- Two-zero.
- Cristiano Ronaldo.

07:16.479 --> 07:18.719
-  Cris is better, eh?
- How are you?

07:18.799 --> 07:21.200
Come on, pal!

07:32.320 --> 07:35.080
We notice in the first half
that it's a very convoluted game.

07:35.159 --> 07:36.400
A strange game.

07:36.479 --> 07:40.039
A game where things are not turning out
as you would expect.

07:45.440 --> 07:47.000
End it already!

07:54.440 --> 07:58.320
<i>Portugal zero!</i>
<i>Thank you to both teams!</i>

07:58.400 --> 08:01.039
<i>Thank you to all the fans… </i>

08:01.799 --> 08:04.760
Portugal has been defeated by Belgium.

08:04.840 --> 08:07.679
It's a game we didn't expect
to end like this.

08:08.239 --> 08:10.239
We were so sure we would win.

08:10.880 --> 08:13.440
<i>Congratulations to Belgium,</i>
<i>that classified…</i>

08:14.320 --> 08:17.320
In life, you always want to win.
To do things right.

08:17.400 --> 08:18.840
But we know that's impossible.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.120
And to know that a loved one--

08:21.200 --> 08:23.679
in this case,
seeing Cristiano Júnior crying,

08:23.760 --> 08:26.440
you feel it, as a father,
and it upsets you.

08:26.520 --> 08:30.280
It's okay, Cris.
This way Dad gets to rest now.

08:31.200 --> 08:33.280
He cries because he feels things.

08:34.319 --> 08:37.199
So, if he cried
because he feels that distress inside him

08:37.280 --> 08:39.159
when things don't turn out all right,

08:39.240 --> 08:42.679
he has the same thing inside as I do,
and it makes me proud.

08:44.240 --> 08:48.079
Don't be sad. You have to cheer Daddy up.
You have to stay calm.

08:48.160 --> 08:49.199
That's the game.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.040
It is a hard time for everyone,

08:53.120 --> 08:55.959
but we have to keep our spirits up
and be super positive,

08:56.480 --> 08:59.600
showing Cristiano our love,
to help him switch off.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.520
Maybe if someone had told us back then

09:04.600 --> 09:08.320
that his father would be the top scorer
in the Euros 2021,

09:08.400 --> 09:10.760
he may have been less upset
about the defeat.

09:11.920 --> 09:15.480
It's a part of life. Nice moments,
and not-so-nice moments,

09:16.839 --> 09:18.400
and we have to be ready.

09:18.480 --> 09:19.959
I always tell him, "In life,

09:20.040 --> 09:22.560
from the moment we are born until we die,

09:22.640 --> 09:24.839
we're going to face difficult things."

09:24.920 --> 09:26.360
"This world is not easy."

09:36.240 --> 09:39.400
MAJORCA, SPAIN

09:44.240 --> 09:46.360
Finally, after a long year of work,

09:46.440 --> 09:48.760
our vacations are kicking off in Majorca.

09:53.920 --> 09:56.920
I love Majorca. It's our third year here.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.760
It has the best waters in Europe.

10:06.520 --> 10:08.839
Everything came out perfectly.

10:08.920 --> 10:11.079
The house, the place, everything.

10:11.760 --> 10:14.400
All our requests were perfectly met
to our needs.

10:20.199 --> 10:24.440
On vacations, what we try to do
is what I can't do during the season.

10:24.520 --> 10:27.480
I want to relax, and do whatever I want…

10:28.600 --> 10:31.400
…be with my loved ones, with my friends.

10:40.560 --> 10:44.000
And to be free as a bird,
doing whatever I want to.

10:45.480 --> 10:48.600
And to relax, to travel, to go to the sea,

10:48.680 --> 10:51.640
to be on a boat, to enjoy life a little.

10:52.160 --> 10:54.120
At home, you're yourself.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.760
I mean, they know
what their dad is really like.

10:58.839 --> 11:00.280
100% Cristiano.

11:00.360 --> 11:04.600
My kids and Gio, my closest friends,
my family… they know me.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.680
The house is huge.

11:09.760 --> 11:13.640
It's right by the sea,
with a pool a bit far from the house,

11:13.719 --> 11:17.240
so that if we take a nap,
the kids can play and not wake us up.

11:17.920 --> 11:21.280
There's plenty of green space
so that the kids can run,

11:21.360 --> 11:24.040
and so people can't
easily access the villa

11:24.120 --> 11:26.040
and keep the paparazzi a bit away.

11:36.640 --> 11:40.280
We've been alone for a few days,
and then our friends joined us.

11:41.440 --> 11:44.480
They've come as their work allowed them to
and it was great.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.600
It was worth it this year.

11:49.320 --> 11:52.400
Cristiano and Gio have invited us
to spend our holiday together.

11:52.480 --> 11:55.880
Being on holiday, being with us,
and then more friends come along.

11:55.959 --> 11:59.199
They come and go.
What else do you need to enjoy?

12:03.040 --> 12:06.440
Every time we meet with friends,
we have such a great time together.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.360
And every time there's a ball around,

12:08.440 --> 12:11.280
they can't help but start tapping the ball
with their feet,

12:11.360 --> 12:13.719
trying to take it from one another
and whatnot.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.680
Well, games, stuff they play.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.760
Cristiano Júnior?

12:28.839 --> 12:32.360
I'd like him to be a player
because he has the ability to be.

12:32.440 --> 12:36.280
I don't want him to let it go
because I think everyone has an ability,

12:36.360 --> 12:38.160
has a gift, has a talent.

12:38.839 --> 12:40.760
Some talents can give you big money,

12:40.839 --> 12:42.719
and some others can't.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.440
But it is a talent, anyway.

12:48.400 --> 12:52.199
Whether it's in Majorca,
or in any other destination,

12:52.280 --> 12:53.640
we love to rest.

12:54.160 --> 12:58.240
We love to enjoy the beach,
the pool, and good restaurants.

12:59.480 --> 13:00.599
And bed.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.719
We like to rest.

13:08.920 --> 13:12.440
CANNES, FRANCE

13:15.640 --> 13:18.400
- 74
- TH INTERNATIONAL CANNES FILM FESTIVAL

13:19.240 --> 13:23.560
Well, well, well, well!
The big day has finally arrived.

13:23.640 --> 13:25.079
The Cannes Festival.

13:26.240 --> 13:29.560
I have interrupted my holiday
to attend the Cannes Festival.

13:30.160 --> 13:33.000
Truth is, it's a little hard
when there's work to do…

13:33.079 --> 13:35.000
…and thank God there is!

13:35.079 --> 13:37.400
It's hard to break away on holidays.

13:37.480 --> 13:40.040
I don't actually mind.
I'm happy like this.

13:47.079 --> 13:50.040
I didn't know Cannes had a beach.
You didn't tell me, biatch.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.079
The French Riviera is…

13:52.160 --> 13:55.440
It's cool. Hey, and the yachts
over there are not bad at all either.

13:55.520 --> 13:58.360
- We could've come by boat ourselves.
- Oh, you're right.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.040
Are you hungry?

14:01.640 --> 14:02.480
I'm always hungry.

14:02.560 --> 14:05.560
I need to have a moderate meal today.
I'm thinking, but I don't know what.

14:05.640 --> 14:07.160
I'll look it up online.

14:08.160 --> 14:10.640
"Five foods to reduce bloating."

14:10.719 --> 14:13.839
"Figs, pineapple, papaya and kiwi."

14:14.880 --> 14:18.040
- Okay. What about real food?
- That's what I was going to say.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.199
Is there something
other than fruit, please?

14:21.040 --> 14:24.240
This year, unfortunately,
the Cannes festival was held in summer.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.439
What's the problem?

14:26.520 --> 14:29.599
When I'm on holiday,
I think, "Well, it's a holiday."

14:29.680 --> 14:33.199
We go to a lot of restaurants.
I eat so many more desserts.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.760
In summer, you want ice cream.

14:34.839 --> 14:38.040
Well, this summer,
I've had my mouth closed for 15 days.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.479
I think I'll have grilled chicken.

14:41.160 --> 14:43.880
I don't need to pose
so I can have real food, right?

14:45.719 --> 14:47.719
- Oh, but you'll make me jealous.

14:48.560 --> 14:50.439
Okay, all right,
I'll have grilled chicken too.

14:51.439 --> 14:53.760
I'm not worried at all about my weight.

14:53.839 --> 14:56.079
I'm worried about
feeling good about myself,

14:56.160 --> 14:58.199
and I'm worried about eating healthily.

14:59.360 --> 15:00.520
Cucumber salad.

15:03.319 --> 15:06.160
I'm joking.
I told her already it's for the massage.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.319
One more.

15:11.400 --> 15:14.719
The days before an event,
you sleep worse, right?

15:14.800 --> 15:17.079
You are more excited so I thought,

15:17.160 --> 15:20.240
"Well, I'll order a couple of cucumbers
and I'll put them on," right?

15:20.319 --> 15:23.240
Well, four euros for half a cucumber.

15:23.760 --> 15:26.040
The most expensive cucumber of my life.

15:27.040 --> 15:30.599
So, what did I do?
I not only put it on my eyes,

15:30.680 --> 15:32.400
but I also ate the leftovers.

15:34.240 --> 15:37.400
Nicolas called me
to do your Cannes arrival shots like this.

15:37.479 --> 15:39.880
I told you I'm not doing arrival shots,
Ramón.

15:39.959 --> 15:43.319
Yes, because we have to take
a picture of the hotel and post it.

15:44.319 --> 15:48.439
But Ramón, I can take the shot
at the banister in my dress and makeup.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.599
Oh, that's right, yes.

15:59.160 --> 16:02.079
Okay, so which one should I start with?
The brown one?

16:02.160 --> 16:04.000
Come here.
You'll have to help me get dressed.

16:04.079 --> 16:06.719
Let's start with the brown one,
which is the dress you'll be wearing.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.079
- Okay, where is she? Julia?
- Let's see that one.

16:09.599 --> 16:11.240
Which one
are you putting on first?

16:11.319 --> 16:13.319
- The Jean Paul.
- Oh, okay. Go ahead.

16:13.400 --> 16:15.680
- Otherwise, Ramón the annoying…

16:15.760 --> 16:18.719
…will end up at the sea,
swimming with the little fishes.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.640
Gio's life has many contrasts.

16:22.160 --> 16:23.160
From a housewife,

16:23.240 --> 16:27.760
because I've seen her cleaning,
and ironing, and vacuuming,

16:29.359 --> 16:33.319
to the opposite of her, being like
the major muse of the festival.

16:34.120 --> 16:37.640
- Julia, don't let anyone sway you--
- I mean, no, I'm not swayed by anyone.

16:37.719 --> 16:39.719
- Yeah.
- Let's see.

16:40.479 --> 16:42.680
- Wow!
- Boom!

16:42.760 --> 16:44.560
- Do you like it?
- So what do you think?

16:45.439 --> 16:46.680
Wow. Amazing.

16:46.760 --> 16:49.280
- So, I'd pose like this--
- I love it with the dress.

16:49.359 --> 16:51.439
It's, like, tighter here.

16:51.520 --> 16:55.120
- Your body looks so great in it.
- That's just my body, baby.

16:55.199 --> 16:57.920
- No, I mean it highlights it.
- But it highlights it.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
I haven't eaten anything.
Not last night, not this morning…

17:01.079 --> 17:02.160
Your hair isn't done…

17:02.839 --> 17:04.159
- Like this?
- Top. Right.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.520
Or look at me like this.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.599
Or like this.

17:09.280 --> 17:11.359
You mean with loose hair
or a bun? Loose.

17:11.440 --> 17:12.760
- Hmm.
- Loose.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.919
- I like it a bit up.
- You do?

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
I'd do a ponytail. It's cleaner.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.040
Oh, please, a ponytail?

17:20.640 --> 17:23.040
To me, as long as you wear
the haute couture…

17:23.119 --> 17:24.919
Jean Paul Gaultier, I'm happy.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.440
This is the one
where we went to Paris.

17:28.520 --> 17:30.280
- Yeah, yeah.
- To the atelier.

17:30.360 --> 17:32.399
And now I have the green one by Ali K,

17:32.480 --> 17:35.840
which is the one we did the fitting for
in Cris's hotel room in Gran Vía.

17:36.600 --> 17:40.720
Ramón is so insistent
that I wear the Jean Paul dress because…

17:40.800 --> 17:43.640
Well, it's an opportunity
and a wonderful option.

17:44.680 --> 17:47.240
Let's go, let's go!
I want to see it!

17:47.320 --> 17:48.360
That? Wow!

17:58.960 --> 18:00.720
Okay, I'll think about it.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.440
- And you'll see.

18:05.080 --> 18:07.600
And that's it.
When I see myself in full hair--

18:07.680 --> 18:10.320
Well, anyway, with both of them
you look spectacular.

18:10.399 --> 18:13.040
- It doesn't matter which one you wear.
- I'll think about it more.

18:13.560 --> 18:14.840
Bye.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.360
Get your makeup done and we'll try the--

18:26.440 --> 18:29.360
Now, at 5:20 p.m.,
they're bringing the jewels.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.080
Take a look at them. They're so beautiful.

18:32.159 --> 18:34.560
Ask for emeralds
just in case I wear the green one.

18:35.720 --> 18:38.159
Okay, uh,
it's just that emeralds don't…

18:38.880 --> 18:40.399
Do you know who's coming today?

18:41.080 --> 18:43.960
Heidi Klum. Nicole Kidman. Sharon Stone.

18:44.840 --> 18:47.720
And brown leather on the beach
doesn't really stand out.

18:49.120 --> 18:52.560
They both suit you. And it's summery
because it shows off your back,

18:52.640 --> 18:55.679
your arms… I mean, more slit…
It's sexy too.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.080
Besides, the jewels that
they are ready to bring up…

18:59.640 --> 19:01.440
- It will make you shine--
- A necklace…

19:02.399 --> 19:04.280
She has the last word.

19:04.360 --> 19:08.120
I give her my opinion, and if I think
something is really important for her,

19:08.200 --> 19:09.320
I insist.

19:11.040 --> 19:14.360
Look, Nicole Kidman, who is going tonight?
This is her in Gaultier.

19:18.159 --> 19:19.240
One of the major ones.

19:19.320 --> 19:22.960
It's not a brand unrelated
to all the celebrities you mentioned.

19:23.600 --> 19:24.679
Quite the opposite.

19:26.600 --> 19:30.760
I'm feeling a little under pressure
from Ramón to not offend anyone.

19:30.840 --> 19:33.960
I don't want anyone to feel bad
because I didn't choose their dress.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.520
Yeah, Gio, we won't push you.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.800
It's your call, but that's what you have
a team of professionals for.

19:41.520 --> 19:44.520
Each of us knows and gives you
the best advice we can for you.

19:49.280 --> 19:52.360
Think about it, keep calm.
Get your makeup done.

19:58.880 --> 20:02.159
We had done a fitting in the morning.
She looked astonishing.

20:02.240 --> 20:04.000
It suited her to perfection.

20:04.080 --> 20:05.240
We thought that was the dress,

20:05.320 --> 20:07.520
but I'm off to look for jewels
for the brown one.

20:07.600 --> 20:10.880
I come back and something had happened
in that room.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.480
We've been working on it
for three months at least.

20:13.560 --> 20:14.800
- But I said nothing.
- Yeah.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.679
She just asked me my opinion.
I just gave my opinion.

20:17.760 --> 20:18.800
Okay.

20:18.880 --> 20:21.640
- I'm not the one with…
- But Nicolas didn't say anything.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.440
- It was me. I want…
- I don't know what's going on.

20:25.960 --> 20:28.360
The photographer
in the suite is Nicolas,

20:28.440 --> 20:30.040
a fashion photographer.

20:30.120 --> 20:32.640
For me, one of the best in Europe.

20:32.720 --> 20:36.320
So actually, I like to,
when I have to travel to festivals,

20:36.399 --> 20:39.080
or if I have the chance
to do a cover and so on,

20:39.640 --> 20:41.040
I like to work with him.

20:41.560 --> 20:45.399
But Cristiano saw me yesterday
in the Jean Paul fitting and he said,

20:45.480 --> 20:47.640
"The brown one? Wear the green one."

20:47.720 --> 20:49.240
He saw it in person.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.240
Each of us is an expert
in their field, you know?

20:52.960 --> 20:55.960
I mean, I'm not a photographer,
and I'm not a stylist,

20:56.040 --> 20:57.280
so I don't pretend to be one.

20:57.360 --> 20:59.720
- You pretend to be a stylist.
- No.

20:59.800 --> 21:03.080
No, I'm your agent
so I'm thinking about your exposure,

21:03.159 --> 21:04.480
about what's best for you,

21:04.560 --> 21:06.320
what can best position you.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.800
I mean, that's what <i>I</i> think about.

21:11.280 --> 21:12.880
And others don't.

21:16.040 --> 21:20.080
It's not that there was some tension
between Ramón and Nicolas.

21:20.159 --> 21:23.840
That day, there was tension
between Ramón and the whole room.

21:23.919 --> 21:27.120
I mean, Ramón was throwing daggers
all over the place.

21:34.159 --> 21:35.480
Since I wasn't really sure

21:35.560 --> 21:37.919
about what dress I'd be wearing
until today,

21:38.480 --> 21:42.120
well, I hadn't really pictured myself
with a hairdo in that dress.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.399
So, I'm still a little indecisive.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.320
The car will pick us up in 20 minutes,

21:52.399 --> 21:55.040
and she still has to make a decision
about the dress.

21:55.120 --> 21:59.439
I mean, she can decide whatever she likes,
but the decision needs to be made now.

22:05.439 --> 22:07.360
- Hi!
- Hi.

22:07.439 --> 22:09.480
- I'm ready. All set.
- Wow!

22:11.919 --> 22:14.600
Georgina has made the right choice,
and it's good for her.

22:15.159 --> 22:17.280
We've gone up a notch
in the world of fashion.

22:17.800 --> 22:19.679
No necklace here, right?

22:20.280 --> 22:21.919
- We can try.
- We can try if you want.

22:23.240 --> 22:26.600
Am I a bit of a brat? Yes.
When I want something, I get it.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.040
We've been with Laura Lee
for a while.

22:30.120 --> 22:32.399
Well, we've been working
for a few months now.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.520
- Or this one.
- It's very Chopard.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.360
This one reminds me more
of the others.

22:39.159 --> 22:43.880
I ended up going with the Jean Paul dress
and I know I'm going to make a splash.

22:46.159 --> 22:48.040
Yes, very nice. Beautiful, Gio.

22:48.120 --> 22:49.080
Beautiful.

22:49.960 --> 22:53.320
LIVING THE DREAM

22:54.320 --> 22:56.760
With this dress,
I feel like many things.

22:57.679 --> 23:00.640
Something between a Greek goddess,
Xena, the warrior,

23:00.720 --> 23:02.919
and I also feel like a princess
with the jewels.

23:03.480 --> 23:04.720
A bit of everything.

23:09.399 --> 23:10.919
Georgina!

23:12.960 --> 23:15.360
- Nice to meet you.
- Georgina!

23:17.080 --> 23:18.320
Let's go, Gio.

23:19.960 --> 23:23.120
Georgina's presence in Cannes
brings a lot of buzz.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.399
She's a very likable celebrity.

23:25.480 --> 23:27.919
The press likes her, people like her.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.200
My aunt likes her. And you like her.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.280
I have to admit
that every time I go to a red carpet,

23:38.360 --> 23:39.679
I get nervous.

23:39.760 --> 23:42.679
I think it's inevitable
and those nerves are necessary

23:42.760 --> 23:45.000
to live and to feel the excitement.

23:45.080 --> 23:47.840
Because these are good nerves,
out of excitement.

23:52.159 --> 23:54.320
When it comes to Georgina, we dream big.

24:03.240 --> 24:06.320
What I like the most
about being on a red carpet

24:06.399 --> 24:09.960
is getting to step on the same ground
as movie stars.

24:12.320 --> 24:15.399
It's like a dream,
and like living my own movie.

24:21.600 --> 24:23.200
The resonance was astonishing.

24:23.919 --> 24:25.720
Even international media,

24:25.800 --> 24:29.040
such as the <i>CR Fashion Book</i>
or fashion publications,

24:29.120 --> 24:31.520
they all did very positive reviews.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.439
Like, important media.

24:33.520 --> 24:35.360
So we really pulled it off.

24:55.840 --> 24:58.120
After the red carpet,
I have an event.

24:58.679 --> 25:00.080
It's a Chopard dinner.

25:00.159 --> 25:02.960
They're inviting their most VIP clients.

25:07.439 --> 25:10.679
Okay, let's try it on.
We have to try things.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.199
And then, suddenly…

25:13.159 --> 25:17.240
I'm a Chopard ambassador.
I love to wear their designs.

25:17.760 --> 25:21.159
To me, they're more than that.
They are pieces of art.

25:21.840 --> 25:23.399
I really relate to them,

25:23.480 --> 25:26.120
and I always choose jewels
that make me feel good,

25:26.199 --> 25:30.080
self-assured, and also,
that suit my personality.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.679
I mean, this one's serious.
This says, "I'm going to a gala dinner."

25:34.760 --> 25:37.439
I mean, this one?
What looks the most expensive?

25:37.520 --> 25:38.480
This one.

25:38.560 --> 25:39.720
Then the expensive one.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.800
- Georgina!

25:50.880 --> 25:52.960
Georgina!
Beautiful! Beautiful!

25:54.640 --> 25:56.640
Go, go, go, go. Please.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.919
Careful with the boy's shoe! The kid!

26:08.600 --> 26:09.760
Go, go, go.

26:18.880 --> 26:20.360
- Welcome to paradise.
- Thank you.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.720
- Cheers, cheers.
- Good luck, good luck, good luck!

26:32.800 --> 26:33.640
Likewise.

26:33.720 --> 26:35.520
- Good luck.
- Ham.

26:36.240 --> 26:39.199
Yeah, yeah, give me ham and good luck.
That's the best. And champagne.

26:39.280 --> 26:43.320
I'm absolutely grateful to all the people
who made it possible, right?

26:43.399 --> 26:47.120
Having such a positive impact,
because… well, it's not only up to me.

26:47.679 --> 26:50.560
There's a lot of work from other people
behind the scenes.

26:51.120 --> 26:53.560
I'm leaving the festival super happy,

26:53.640 --> 26:56.919
and going back to my holiday
with my partner and children.

26:58.040 --> 27:01.399
LISBON, PORTUGAL

27:03.080 --> 27:05.720
Everyone's so considerate
with us in Portugal,

27:05.800 --> 27:07.840
even though it's Cristiano's homeland.

27:08.399 --> 27:11.640
But you walk down the street,
and everyone's keeping their distance.

27:11.720 --> 27:13.960
It's a comfortable place to spend summer.

27:14.480 --> 27:17.199
In the future,
we'll probably live in Portugal.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.880
So, are you training tomorrow morning?

27:26.480 --> 27:28.720
- I'll go shopping with Julia.
- Okay, okay.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.960
Do we have time
to go to Cascais for lunch?

27:31.040 --> 27:33.600
I just want them to see Cascais
because they don't know it.

27:33.679 --> 27:34.960
We'll show them the house.

27:35.040 --> 27:37.919
- So, we're going. We're going tomorrow.
- To Cascais. For a nice fish.

27:38.480 --> 27:42.040
I finish… I finish training
and head straight there.

27:43.520 --> 27:45.240
Sometimes, it's the little things.

27:46.159 --> 27:48.520
Let me tell you,
I live in an apartment nearby.

27:55.320 --> 27:56.480
The other day,

27:56.560 --> 27:59.960
I went out for a coffee
just six meters away from my house.

28:00.040 --> 28:01.080
With two friends.

28:01.679 --> 28:06.240
I was talking to them and I said,
"Shit, I feel fucking great here."

28:08.159 --> 28:10.199
They were like,
"What's wrong with you, dude?"

28:10.280 --> 28:11.600
"Are you out of your mind?"

28:11.679 --> 28:14.679
I felt great because
it was a very ordinary place,

28:15.280 --> 28:17.280
but I felt free as a bird, you know?

28:17.360 --> 28:19.679
Someone came by. "Good morning" and stuff,

28:19.760 --> 28:22.520
but I didn't feel overwhelmed
by everyone watching me.

28:22.600 --> 28:26.520
So, there I was enjoying…
I was under the sunlight even.

28:27.919 --> 28:31.439
I said that. "But, Cris," they said,
"that's so normal."

28:31.520 --> 28:33.320
"Yeah, but for you, not for me."

28:33.959 --> 28:36.959
But I never-- I always say this.
I could never complain.

28:37.760 --> 28:39.679
- Did you talk to the kids today?
- I called them.

28:39.760 --> 28:40.679
Yes?

28:40.760 --> 28:42.959
Yes, they wanted to go
to the neighbor's pool.

28:43.040 --> 28:45.399
- They were seeing him from the balcony--
- But they can go.

28:45.480 --> 28:48.199
Yeah, no, I'd rather wait
since we're leaving in two days.

28:48.280 --> 28:50.560
- We'll go with them on Sunday.
- Yeah, we'll take them.

28:50.639 --> 28:51.520
Sure.

28:51.600 --> 28:53.840
Alberto told me
that the island is open in the mornings.

28:54.879 --> 28:56.639
Well, it's also our last day.

28:56.720 --> 28:58.120
- Right.
- After that, double session,

28:58.199 --> 29:00.120
- double session, double session--
- Right.

29:01.360 --> 29:03.000
And bye-bye holidays.

29:06.280 --> 29:08.520
What I do during my holidays is stay fit.

29:09.120 --> 29:11.840
I'm still driven to play football
for a few more years,

29:12.520 --> 29:15.840
but what I do during my holidays is
what I usually can't do

29:15.919 --> 29:17.679
when I'm competing.

29:18.840 --> 29:20.399
We still have three days.

29:20.480 --> 29:21.959
Keep calm, keep calm.

29:22.800 --> 29:24.480
- Cheers, my dear.
- I have the gift.

29:24.560 --> 29:26.439
- You sure do.

29:40.320 --> 29:43.760
MADRID, SPAIN

29:50.199 --> 29:52.879
Tonight, I've set up a surprise
for my sister

29:52.959 --> 29:55.720
so that she knows the gender of her baby
that she's expecting.

29:56.560 --> 29:58.800
I'm making a surprise dinner
for her with friends

29:58.879 --> 30:01.399
who I know are also very important to her.

30:01.480 --> 30:04.840
And well, I'll tell Ivi today
what baby she's expecting.

30:04.919 --> 30:06.720
- Let's see what the parents think.
- Let's see.

30:07.520 --> 30:10.399
- She says it's a girl.
- I think it's a girl.

30:10.480 --> 30:12.800
- I… I think it's a boy.
- Yeah?

30:12.879 --> 30:14.280
So we can't be wrong.

30:14.919 --> 30:18.600
I needed my sister to tell me
because I actually had the…

30:18.679 --> 30:21.959
let's say, the genetic analysis
that I got done.

30:22.040 --> 30:27.040
The lab technician was going to tell me
on the phone, so I said, "No, no, wait."

30:27.120 --> 30:30.480
"Don't tell me. I want to find out
from someone special to me."

30:31.280 --> 30:34.280
I can't believe you didn't actually
tell the gender to anybody.

30:34.360 --> 30:35.560
I don't believe it.

30:35.639 --> 30:38.159
- You told Georgina.
- Well, Cristiano Júnior knows.

30:38.240 --> 30:40.480
Cris knows
because he heard a few minutes ago.

30:40.560 --> 30:41.840
I didn't tell anybody.

30:41.919 --> 30:44.399
In Monaco, I was clear about
what I thought,

30:44.480 --> 30:47.360
according to my calculations,
my chain, and my hand.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.399
- It was a boy, right? In Monaco.
- A girl. A girl!

30:50.480 --> 30:53.040
- Oh, you're confusing me now.
- And everybody kept saying,

30:53.120 --> 30:56.080
- "No, this and that."
- I don't know if I trust Georgiology.

31:02.720 --> 31:04.000
- It's straight.
- Straight.

31:04.080 --> 31:07.199
- See? Girl.
- It's a girl.

31:07.280 --> 31:09.360
Well, place your bets.

31:09.439 --> 31:12.199
- Okay, what do we bet?
- Come on, or we'll lose out on the money.

31:12.280 --> 31:13.320
What do we bet?

31:13.399 --> 31:16.919
But I'm not participating,
so I'm not paying anything to the pot.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.240
- The only one with money.
- …who can pay the most.

31:21.320 --> 31:22.159
Thank you!

31:22.240 --> 31:24.399
In case somebody asks,
it's in euros.

31:24.480 --> 31:27.520
Come on, to the baby,
which is the important thing.

31:28.240 --> 31:31.439
- And to more babies!
- We're gathered here-- To the baby.

31:31.520 --> 31:34.320
- Each of us makes a toast.
- Yeah! A toast each.

31:34.399 --> 31:37.240
To those that wish us well;
the rest can go to hell.

31:37.320 --> 31:40.120
- Oh!

31:42.360 --> 31:44.720
- It's a fly.
- With all due respect,

31:44.800 --> 31:46.520
- there were more flies--
- It must be limping.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.760
- No, don't touch it.
- Sir, take the fly away from me.

31:50.959 --> 31:53.800
- "Take the fly away."
- It has no wings. It can't fly.

31:53.879 --> 31:54.919
Poor thing.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.760
- Oh, no!
- Take away the fly.

31:57.480 --> 32:00.080
- Yes, I wanted it.
- You said, "Take the fly away."

32:00.679 --> 32:03.639
- It had no wings, so it couldn't fly.
- It was missing a wing, poor thing.

32:12.120 --> 32:14.600
Well, it's time to know
what you're expecting.

32:16.439 --> 32:17.959
Bring in the surprise!

32:23.600 --> 32:25.840
- Oh my God!

32:26.719 --> 32:28.760
- I actually looked over there.
- So did I.

32:28.840 --> 32:31.240
- The embryo's in there.
- I'm sweaty.

32:32.639 --> 32:33.840
Do I have to open it?

32:33.919 --> 32:35.800
There is your embryo.

32:35.879 --> 32:36.879
I'm shaky.

32:37.760 --> 32:40.560
Thank you, everyone, for being here
with me and Carlitos.

32:42.439 --> 32:43.320
Very good.

32:44.560 --> 32:45.719
Turn it around, love.

32:45.800 --> 32:47.879
- Turn it. Turn it over.
- Turn it over. Yeah!

32:50.199 --> 32:52.679
- Open it!
- Oh, God, I'm so nervous.

33:01.240 --> 33:02.600
I can't believe it!

33:03.120 --> 33:05.520
- I told you.
- Unbelievable.

33:05.600 --> 33:08.080
- I told you.
- I just can't believe it.

33:10.199 --> 33:11.919
A girl. Amazing.

33:13.520 --> 33:14.439
So cool.

33:15.040 --> 33:17.800
- You knew, right? A girl.
- Of course.

33:19.679 --> 33:21.360
So exciting.

33:21.439 --> 33:23.719
Your life is going to change
for the better.

33:25.280 --> 33:26.360
- You think?
- Yes.

33:26.439 --> 33:30.280
- For the better?
- Always. A baby always changes your life.

33:30.360 --> 33:32.959
I wonder how I could have had
such a happy life,

33:33.040 --> 33:35.840
because I considered myself
a very happy girl,

33:35.919 --> 33:38.679
without having this happiness
which is full and absolute.

33:38.760 --> 33:39.840
Yeah.

33:39.919 --> 33:43.520
It's a constant worry,
because you'll never stop worrying,

33:43.600 --> 33:46.959
even about the color of her nails.
About everything, but…

33:48.320 --> 33:50.679
- Beautiful.
- You never stop worrying.

33:52.040 --> 33:52.919
Very good.

33:53.719 --> 33:55.840
I can't wait to see her as a mom.

33:56.520 --> 33:58.480
I'm sure she'll be
one of the greatest mothers

33:58.560 --> 34:02.159
in the world because she's very attentive
and very dedicated.

34:02.679 --> 34:04.280
So, she'll be the best mom.

34:08.920 --> 34:10.480
Name? What name?

34:10.560 --> 34:13.480
- My sister wants me to call her Georgina.
- Thanks, Gio.

34:13.560 --> 34:16.120
- It's a great name.
- She wants me to call her Georgina.

34:16.199 --> 34:18.719
Not Georgina García,
but Georgina Rodríguez.

34:18.799 --> 34:21.120
- I love you, hon.

34:23.319 --> 34:25.400
She's so sweet and kind and stuff,

34:25.480 --> 34:27.639
that having a girl suits her more,

34:27.719 --> 34:30.400
because she'll dress her up in dresses.

34:30.480 --> 34:33.440
I know she'll enjoy the girly stuff,
the clothes.

34:34.360 --> 34:35.839
Girls are always perkier.

34:35.920 --> 34:38.400
- Oh, there's a diamond necklace too!
- It's shiny.

34:38.480 --> 34:40.760
I hadn't seen it.

34:40.839 --> 34:42.760
- Is this for me?
- It's hard to miss.

34:42.839 --> 34:44.199
Wow!

34:44.280 --> 34:47.360
It turns out Ivana opens the box
with the baby socks

34:47.440 --> 34:49.799
and there's that
awesome diamond necklace inside.

34:49.880 --> 34:53.080
Well, she says she didn't realize.
She only saw the baby socks.

34:53.159 --> 34:57.520
Come on, how could you miss that shine
worth thousands and thousands of euros?

34:58.200 --> 34:59.240
Oh, it's amazing.

35:00.080 --> 35:02.920
That way, you won't steal mine.
Now you have your own.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.560
- It's called Rivière, right?
- Yes.

35:04.640 --> 35:07.040
Well, this is the present for my niece.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.280
It brings luck--

35:08.360 --> 35:10.880
You can use it until
she wants to take it from you.

35:12.680 --> 35:13.680
Until she's 18.

35:13.760 --> 35:15.080
It's beautiful.

35:15.760 --> 35:17.080
So wonderful.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.839
I love it. I always wanted to have--
Well, not always…

35:20.920 --> 35:22.280
Since I saw my sister's.

35:22.360 --> 35:25.360
And I thought, "Wow, a Rivière,"
which is what it's called.

35:25.440 --> 35:26.760
And I thought, "So beautiful."

35:26.839 --> 35:28.600
- What you wanted.
- It's what you thought, huh?

35:28.680 --> 35:31.319
- Georgiology exists. And it works.
- I won.

35:31.400 --> 35:33.080
Hashtag Georgiology.

35:33.160 --> 35:35.040
"Find out your baby's gender."

35:35.760 --> 35:37.720
I love you, guys. Thanks for the surprise.

35:37.799 --> 35:40.799
And to many more to come.
Congratulations.

35:40.880 --> 35:42.520
My Helen. My Mamen.

35:47.440 --> 35:50.400
JACA, SPAIN

35:50.480 --> 35:54.839
Jaca is the place where I grew up,
where I have my childhood memories.

35:55.480 --> 35:58.000
Where I enjoyed my family's love,

35:58.080 --> 35:59.880
my parents, my sister.

36:03.720 --> 36:07.400
Her life story, her family story…
it's very similar to mine.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.440
As the years go by,
I think we have a lot of things in common.

36:13.400 --> 36:15.160
I'm kind of in shock.

36:15.240 --> 36:16.400
It's weird.

36:17.880 --> 36:20.000
I would have loved
to invite Mommy and Dad.

36:20.640 --> 36:21.960
Oh…
