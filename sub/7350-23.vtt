WEBVTT

00:03.504 --> 00:05.639
Sasha-- she's
out of control.

00:05.673 --> 00:08.076
We know she's been flooding
the ports with contraband.

00:09.677 --> 00:12.213
That don't even scratch
the surface.

00:12.246 --> 00:14.082
There's a storm coming,

00:14.115 --> 00:16.550
likes of which you never seen.

00:16.584 --> 00:19.520
Gonna hit you Navy folks
where you live.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.355
What are you talking about?

00:22.323 --> 00:23.357
Tell me.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.359
Just as soon as I sign

00:25.393 --> 00:27.261
them agreement papers.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.332
BRODY:
Over there.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.466
Shooter's heading out.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.068
Cut him off!

00:37.738 --> 00:39.707
PRIDE:
Before Baitfish was killed,

00:39.740 --> 00:41.475
he said something about a storm

00:41.509 --> 00:42.843
coming in, bigger
than anything

00:42.876 --> 00:44.345
this city's seen before.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.379
MAN:
65 acres here.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.415
Another 35
across the river.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.683
Well, where do you want
to start?

01:23.484 --> 01:25.819
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:25.853 --> 01:28.456
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:28.489 --> 01:31.159
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:31.192 --> 01:32.460
* How, how, how, how

01:32.493 --> 01:34.628
* Hey, hey

01:40.468 --> 01:41.835
* You gotta come on.

01:47.175 --> 01:49.477
* Put your dreams away for now

01:49.510 --> 01:51.779
* I won't see you
for some time *

01:51.812 --> 01:54.515
* I am lost in my mind

01:54.548 --> 01:56.850
* I get lost in my mind

01:56.884 --> 01:59.487
* Mama once told me

01:59.520 --> 02:02.423
* You're already home
where you feel loved *

02:02.456 --> 02:04.925
* I am lost in my mind

02:04.958 --> 02:08.162
Ah, infamous Baitfish wall.

02:08.196 --> 02:10.431
Baitfish wall no more.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.702
You don't knock?
Well,

02:14.735 --> 02:16.537
knocking just gives the dudes
on the other side of the door

02:16.570 --> 02:18.306
a chance to load up
and aim.

02:18.339 --> 02:20.308
Better to put your head down
and barge in.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.410
Kind of my life philosophy.

02:22.443 --> 02:25.413
Thought you'd be back
at your offices at ATF by now.

02:25.446 --> 02:27.781
Uh, well, while
I'm healing,

02:27.815 --> 02:30.351
resident in charge said
I could stay put,

02:30.384 --> 02:33.254
close up the files
on my undercover work.

02:33.287 --> 02:34.488
LASALLE:
King.

02:35.523 --> 02:36.490
Percy.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.259
Lasalle.

02:38.292 --> 02:40.794
Loretta and Sebastian are here.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.930
Gather the group at SCIF.
You got it.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.534
SCIF means secret-secret.
What's up?

02:46.567 --> 02:47.868
Come.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.971
We've been told a
storm is coming.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.807
Already intercepted cash...

02:53.841 --> 02:55.509
bullets...

02:55.543 --> 02:57.478
antiquities.

02:57.511 --> 03:00.581
All of which came through the
ports hidden in Navy shipments.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.816
Checked with Homeland
and the Feds.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.885
Notified every agency and so far
nothing on their radars.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.720
Got the Navy increasing
force protection levels

03:06.754 --> 03:08.989
at the ports and
sensitive targets.

03:09.022 --> 03:12.760
If they find anything, we're
first on their call list.

03:12.793 --> 03:15.396
Dude, we don't raise
our hands in here.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.497
What are you

03:16.530 --> 03:18.666
Look, I know you got
an office here now,

03:18.699 --> 03:20.234
but I'm still
technically a visitor.

03:20.268 --> 03:21.535
They always like that?
Uh-huh.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.771
Uh, Dwayne, why are we here?

03:23.804 --> 03:25.406
That was gonna be my question.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.641
What just happened
to Baitfish.

03:27.675 --> 03:30.544
No one knew the route
but the people on the inside.

03:30.578 --> 03:33.514
And yet, he was gunned down.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.949
Which can only mean that...
We have a mole.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.286
You think it could be someone
from our office?

03:38.319 --> 03:39.420
PRIDE:
No.

03:39.453 --> 03:40.588
But at this point,

03:40.621 --> 03:41.755
I'm not ruling anything out.

03:41.789 --> 03:43.557
Something big is coming.

03:43.591 --> 03:47.561
The what and when of it
are still up in the air.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.630
Until we've neutralized
the threat,

03:49.663 --> 03:52.533
I want you all to assume
that the only people

03:52.566 --> 03:55.669
you can trust...
are in this room.

04:02.376 --> 04:03.944
Dead sailor at the port.

04:03.977 --> 04:07.681
Patton, sweep
the entire facility for bugs.

04:07.715 --> 04:10.984
Everyone, on your toes.

04:11.018 --> 04:14.588
Brody and Lasalle,
you're with me.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.690
Mind if I hitch a hide?
Sure.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.592
Come on.

04:21.729 --> 04:24.398
When you put us on alert,
I reached out to port ops

04:24.432 --> 04:26.534
and the supply officer
in charge.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.502
Wanted to make sure
he checked and rechecked

04:28.536 --> 04:29.970
our cargo
before my ship's arrival.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.706
When I couldn't get
a hold of him this morning,

04:32.740 --> 04:34.742
I contacted
my civilian counterpart.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.445
Jonathan Warren,
yard manager, Port Commission.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.447
Got in my car,
drove right here.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.482
That's where I found him.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.885
Who's the deceased?

04:44.918 --> 04:47.555
Logistics Specialist
Third Class David Hanson.

04:49.590 --> 04:50.724
Since this is a mixed-use port

04:50.758 --> 04:52.826
and terminal security runs
through me,

04:52.860 --> 04:54.595
I dealt with David a lot.

04:54.628 --> 04:55.863
Hard worker.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.097
First in, last out.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.666
He got family?

04:58.699 --> 05:00.067
Wife and daughter.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.102
I'll speak to Hanson's
commanding officer.

05:02.135 --> 05:05.373
Get him to reach out to CACO,
make sure the family's notified.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.641
Camera there.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.810
Pointed in the general
direction of our victim.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.645
Can you get us the feed?

05:11.679 --> 05:13.581
I'll have it to you
by this afternoon.

05:13.614 --> 05:16.917
Thank you.
Where are we?

05:16.950 --> 05:19.353
Uh, based on rigor
and body temp,

05:19.387 --> 05:21.755
time of death--
3:00, 3:30 this morning.

05:21.789 --> 05:25.659
And judging by the incised wound
in his jugular vein...

05:27.695 --> 05:30.698
...cause of death--
severe hemorrhaging.

05:31.699 --> 05:33.467
He bled out here.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.769
Guys, there are a dozen
containers here.

05:35.803 --> 05:38.806
This is the only one
that's been opened.

05:40.741 --> 05:43.777
So, maybe Hanson's prepping
containers for ship's arrival,

05:43.811 --> 05:46.714
finds someone in the
midst of a robbery,

05:46.747 --> 05:48.749
things get ugly.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.018
Let's see what's
worth killing for.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.430
Rogue cafeteria worker
looking to score

06:02.463 --> 06:04.665
some free table setups?

06:06.534 --> 06:07.701
Hang on.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.738
PVC pipe.

06:10.771 --> 06:14.041
Keeps going, too.

06:14.074 --> 06:16.977
Tubes to nowhere?

06:20.113 --> 06:22.683
It's a wall of sheet metal.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.789
Looks detached down here.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.134
What the...?

06:44.705 --> 06:46.807
Tube for air.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.711
People were stowed here.

06:53.046 --> 06:55.649
Hanson wasn't killed
for mess trays.

06:55.683 --> 06:58.085
If this is what Baitfish
warned us about...

06:58.118 --> 07:01.622
Then the storm isn't a what.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.857
It's a who.

07:15.503 --> 07:17.705
What's Washington say?

07:17.738 --> 07:20.040
Deputy director's been
updated on the threat.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.710
Marching orders--
find out who the hell was inside

07:22.743 --> 07:25.746
that container and how
our dead sailor was involved.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.114
Shouldn't we take this
conversation back in...?

07:27.147 --> 07:29.216
Patton's sweep
came back clean.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.485
Tell me things.
Talked to NSA.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.987
300 enemies of the state
with port presence.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.656
Members of Somali Mafia,

07:35.689 --> 07:37.124
Cambodia's Tycoon
Syndicate and Hezbollah.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.826
And our container?

07:38.859 --> 07:40.794
Sebastian's analyzing
everything in that compartment,

07:40.828 --> 07:42.129
combing for DNA.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.531
As for the origin
of the container,

07:43.564 --> 07:44.832
it's a ghost.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.534
It wasn't scanned
when it came in.

07:46.567 --> 07:47.668
Unusual?

07:47.701 --> 07:49.002
With 10,000 containers
coming through

07:49.036 --> 07:50.804
each week,
it's not unheard of.

07:50.838 --> 07:53.574
Port Commission reports
a two percent loss annually.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.543
But seeing as this one was
filled with people--

07:55.576 --> 07:57.711
suspicious.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.518
My condolences go out
to the family

08:04.552 --> 08:06.720
of the young sailor
who was killed today.

08:06.754 --> 08:08.789
And I'm here
to make them a promise

08:08.822 --> 08:10.591
that justice will be served

08:10.624 --> 08:12.926
and the safety
of our parishes will be returned

08:12.960 --> 08:15.796
to the standard we all deserve.
Thank you...

08:15.829 --> 08:18.265
Election season already?

08:18.298 --> 08:20.100
Always and forever with him.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.540
Loretta's got something
on our sailor.

08:26.574 --> 08:28.008
Check in, will you?

08:28.041 --> 08:29.309
And you?

08:29.342 --> 08:31.579
Container and mole
are connected.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.714
You chase down the former.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.783
Let me hunt down the latter.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.085
Who's driving, Lasalle--
you or me?

08:38.118 --> 08:39.687
Well, you got
the morning java,

08:39.720 --> 08:41.188
so I'll brave
the Quarter traffic.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.190
All right.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.997
St. Christopher medallion?

08:50.030 --> 08:51.565
Savannah's dad...

08:51.599 --> 08:54.635
said she wanted me
to have it.

08:54.668 --> 08:55.736
You want to talk about it?

08:55.769 --> 08:56.837
Nope.

08:56.870 --> 08:57.838
You sure?

08:57.871 --> 08:59.339
Yup.

08:59.372 --> 09:02.743
Okay.

09:02.776 --> 09:03.376
Mole, huh?

09:03.410 --> 09:05.879
And you coming to me, son?

09:05.913 --> 09:07.881
During your heyday,
you had an insider

09:07.915 --> 09:09.850
in nearly every office
in the city.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.886
If there were a professional
corruption league,

09:12.920 --> 09:15.656
you would've been
the Lebron James.

09:15.689 --> 09:18.692
Should I be touched or offended?

09:18.726 --> 09:19.860
Try being helpful.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.862
Sounds to me like somebody

09:21.895 --> 09:23.631
in Navy uniform
is your problem.

09:23.664 --> 09:24.765
No.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.967
Threat's coming
through the Navy.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.036
But my problem-- the mole--

09:29.069 --> 09:31.038
someone in the city.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.106
All right, start with theories.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.375
Got one.
Can't land it.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.910
Ah, let me guess.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.178
Young Hamilton?

09:39.346 --> 09:41.615
Must run in the gene pool.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.653
The ports are
in his district.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.621
If he was getting
kickbacks

09:47.655 --> 09:48.956
by letting things
slip through,

09:48.989 --> 09:50.824
my suddenly dead
witness's testimony

09:50.858 --> 09:52.926
would've meant that
the councilman

09:52.960 --> 09:55.062
could've been your
new cell mate.

09:55.095 --> 09:59.232
Well, being in the district
doesn't mean he has control.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.736
Look, say for a moment
that Hamilton is your mole.

10:02.770 --> 10:06.306
He still could have somebody
on the inside pulling strings.

10:06.339 --> 10:09.109
Stevedore or truck driver,
scales operator...

10:09.142 --> 10:10.744
An insider.

10:10.778 --> 10:14.648
Find him or her, and maybe
they can prove your hunch.

10:14.682 --> 10:16.416
Meantime, I still got sources.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.418
Let me dig.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.821
Appreciate that.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.856
Son?

10:25.826 --> 10:27.861
Why are you trusting me
with this?

10:27.895 --> 10:31.965
You bilked a whole lot of people
out of their money, Cassius,

10:31.999 --> 10:34.134
but you might be the only person

10:34.167 --> 10:36.303
who loves this city
as much as me.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.974
Sir.
Thank you.

10:44.311 --> 10:49.216
I swabbed Specialist Hanson's
throat wound for analysis.

10:49.249 --> 10:53.754
Found iron oxide residue,
presumably rust from a blade.

10:53.787 --> 10:56.189
Also, trace amounts
of organic matter,

10:56.223 --> 10:57.958
which turned out
to be tuna.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.459
Tuna?

10:59.492 --> 11:02.830
Albacore, specifically.

11:02.863 --> 11:05.065
Tuna can
from inside the container.

11:05.098 --> 11:08.235
Found matching iron oxide
residue around the rim.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.903
If the same knife
that killed Hanson

11:09.937 --> 11:11.739
also opened that can, then...

11:11.772 --> 11:14.742
Whoever was in the container
claimed his first victim.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.710
Posible nada with the señor.

11:16.744 --> 11:19.079
Perdón por la interrupción.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.781
What's with the Spanish, brah?

11:20.814 --> 11:24.317
Un momento para
the... explanation.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.053
Okay, so,

11:26.086 --> 11:27.921
I found a few hair
follicles from the container

11:27.955 --> 11:29.289
with the roots
still attached.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.424
Now, usually we use DNA
to pinpoint identity,

11:31.458 --> 11:32.893
but guessing that we don't have

11:32.926 --> 11:34.995
our stowaways' I.D.s
in our system,

11:35.028 --> 11:36.797
I scanned for
nuclear DNA,

11:36.830 --> 11:38.766
which pinpoints origins and sex

11:38.799 --> 11:40.267
based on root
samples, and...

11:40.300 --> 11:42.970
dios mio, I got hits.

11:43.003 --> 11:45.906
Uh, all female, and judging
by the condition of the hair,

11:45.939 --> 11:48.742
between 20 and 30 years old,
also with Incan origins.

11:48.776 --> 11:52.279
Hence my terrible Spanish
when I walked in.

11:52.312 --> 11:53.881
I think these woman came

11:53.914 --> 11:55.415
from a coastal region
of South America,

11:55.448 --> 11:58.285
specifically... Ecuador.

12:00.187 --> 12:01.855
Young Ecuadorian women?

12:01.889 --> 12:03.791
That's our storm?

12:03.824 --> 12:05.826
You seen those photos
of girls joining ISIS?

12:05.859 --> 12:07.895
Wolf in sheep's
clothing.

12:07.928 --> 12:10.497
Oh, come on. These women
scream sex ring, not terrorism.

12:10.530 --> 12:14.267
Regardless, BOLO for the women
went out an hour and a half ago

12:14.301 --> 12:16.003
based on Sebastian's
description.

12:16.036 --> 12:18.071
Which doesn't match anyone
on the DOD

12:18.105 --> 12:20.073
or NSA's threat list.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.509
Maybe there was someone else
in that box who does.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.411
Well, look who's
still here.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.446
Can't bear to
leave us, Percy?

12:26.479 --> 12:28.782
Got a fridge
that just won't quit.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.517
Tad too much meat product
for my taste,

12:30.550 --> 12:32.419
but damn, y'all have
a lot of Perrier.

12:32.452 --> 12:35.122
We tested every shred
of evidence in that box.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.124
No sign of anyone
other than those women.

12:37.157 --> 12:40.293
Yeah, well, some things
are no longer in that box.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.129
Early 2009,

12:42.162 --> 12:44.865
I was part of an ATF raid
of an End of Days group.

12:44.898 --> 12:47.234
Perps fled, left the women
and children behind.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.069
Couldn't find a shred
of their DNA

12:49.102 --> 12:51.038
until we realized
there was one thing

12:51.071 --> 12:52.906
they couldn't help
putting their hands on.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.042
The women.
Bingo. Swabbed the girls,

12:55.075 --> 12:57.911
found trace amounts of tissue
and hair follicles.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.913
Got the bastards.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.882
I'll interface with
the lab guy, which

13:01.915 --> 13:03.483
gives me another chance
to hang out

13:03.516 --> 13:05.185
with the tall,
handsome man-child.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.187
Sebastian?

13:07.220 --> 13:09.489
You never know, Lasalle.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.859
Might like 'em wordy and nerdy.

13:11.892 --> 13:14.962
BRODY:
VICE just got word

13:14.995 --> 13:18.365
a group of South American
girls are being held in Tremé.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.567
Let's move.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.337
Guys.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.976
My officers been staking
this house for weeks.

13:29.009 --> 13:32.012
Word is, four coyotes inside,
two at the door,

13:32.045 --> 13:33.246
two in the cash room
around back.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.848
My men are ready to move.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.483
We got a dead Navy sailor.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.418
Girls inside may have
intel on the killer.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.520
You think he's a smuggler?

13:40.553 --> 13:42.355
That's what we're
here to find out.

13:42.389 --> 13:43.857
My men go on your word.

13:43.891 --> 13:46.493
Why don't you and I take
the front door?

13:46.526 --> 13:49.096
Christopher, take the fellows
around back.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.830
Let's go.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.067
PRIDE:
NCIS!

13:57.437 --> 13:58.438
Don't move!

14:04.912 --> 14:06.914
One down.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.524
Two down.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.065
PRIDE:
Don't move!

14:27.935 --> 14:28.969
Where are the girls?

14:29.002 --> 14:30.203
Where are they?

14:32.940 --> 14:37.010
We... were in the box

14:37.044 --> 14:40.513
for... three days.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.550
Dark.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.486
:
I think I'm going to die.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.688
When we stop,

14:48.721 --> 14:52.392
bad men tell us quiet,

14:52.425 --> 14:55.528
wait for somebody
to open the door.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.966
There were... men?

14:58.999 --> 15:01.001
How many?

15:01.034 --> 15:01.969
Dos.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.037
Uh,

15:04.071 --> 15:05.705
they smoke,

15:05.738 --> 15:10.177
never say any words.

15:12.179 --> 15:15.448
While we were waiting
for somebody to open the door,

15:15.482 --> 15:18.151
one girl-- she start crying.

15:21.989 --> 15:25.592
A man, um... a...

15:25.625 --> 15:27.260
¿Cómo se dice?

15:27.294 --> 15:29.096
Uh, in a suit?

15:29.129 --> 15:30.230
Uniform?

15:30.263 --> 15:31.631
Sí.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.133
He got us out.

15:34.167 --> 15:37.204
Bad man... hit him.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.642
Cut his throat.

15:44.677 --> 15:48.015
The bad man--

15:48.048 --> 15:51.651
what did he look like?

15:51.684 --> 15:55.122
Uh, he has, um...

15:55.155 --> 15:58.025
a fire and machete.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.726
Like this.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.699
PATTON:
Thousands of tattoos
in the database.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.436
Got to refine the search.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.772
PRIDE:
Is that Sebastian?

16:12.805 --> 16:15.708
: You call that
a wellness elixir?

16:15.742 --> 16:18.545
Cayenne pepper,
oil of oregano, and ginger.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.780
Oh. Oh, hey, guys.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.582
Uh, turns out Sonja
and I share a common interest

16:22.615 --> 16:24.451
in the healing
property of roots.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.686
You called us?

16:26.719 --> 16:30.023
Oh, right. So, um, thanks to
Sonja's very astute insight,

16:30.057 --> 16:33.026
uh, we had the stowaway girls'
clothing sent for testing,

16:33.060 --> 16:36.029
swabbed and scraped for
epithelial cell tissue, and...

16:36.063 --> 16:38.531
Drumroll, please.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.267
Nuclear DNA results?

16:40.300 --> 16:42.602
Two men, West African descent.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.404
Send us your results.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.173
Most def.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.308
Okay, so let's add this new
information to the mix.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.343
Refining search parameters.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.384
PATTON:
And bam.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.454
Solomon Ekpo.

17:01.488 --> 17:04.091
Leader of a terrorist
group out of West Africa

17:04.124 --> 17:05.525
known as the Niger
Delta Renegades.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.194
PATTON: FBI has
a video clip.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.463
You come to our home,

17:10.497 --> 17:14.301
you choke our land for petrol,
pollute our villages.

17:14.334 --> 17:17.704
What you take from us,
we'll take from you.

17:17.737 --> 17:20.740
Not in oil; in blood.

17:24.177 --> 17:26.846
Our storm...

17:26.879 --> 17:29.682
just turned into a hurricane.

17:39.526 --> 17:42.729
According to NSA,
Solomon Ekpo went off the grid

17:42.762 --> 17:44.764
a few months back.

17:44.797 --> 17:47.600
Intel suggests he was trying
to find a way into the country.

17:47.634 --> 17:50.670
And with the Navy
shipments compromised...

17:50.703 --> 17:52.705
Flees Nigeria,
heads to South America

17:52.739 --> 17:55.675
with his chief lieutenant,
Charles Turay.

17:55.708 --> 17:58.778
And the two of them hitch a ride
in a container up to the States?

17:58.811 --> 18:00.247
That's the current theory.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.481
What do we know
about Ekpo?

18:01.514 --> 18:03.483
Solomon Ekpo,

18:03.516 --> 18:06.353
born and raised on
the Nigeria coast,

18:06.386 --> 18:09.389
owned a cassava farm,
was a father and husband

18:09.422 --> 18:12.225
until '87 when the Greybridge
Energy oil pipeline fire

18:12.259 --> 18:13.493
took all that away.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.695
His wife and children
were burned to death.

18:15.728 --> 18:18.231
Shortly after, he started
the Niger Delta Renegades

18:18.265 --> 18:21.268
in hopes of taking revenge
on the Western energy sector.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.270
He began with attacking
oil tankers,

18:23.303 --> 18:24.904
and when he didn't
get results,

18:24.937 --> 18:28.175
he bombed the USS Allegiance,
killing five sailors.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.510
Hanson's his first victim
on American soil.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.679
Our job is to make sure
it's his last.

18:32.712 --> 18:35.415
Get me a list of potential
targets and any chatter.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.883
Coming from the Renegades--
got it.

18:36.916 --> 18:39.452
Focus on the last
six months.

18:39.486 --> 18:42.289
So Ekpo and Turay
were in the container,

18:42.322 --> 18:44.591
Hanson opens it, and one of the
two Nigerians slits his throat.

18:44.624 --> 18:45.892
They were waiting
for someone

18:45.925 --> 18:47.427
to get them out
of that container.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.162
Yeah, probably wasn't Hanson.

18:49.196 --> 18:51.731
Where the hell are we
with the surveillance footage?

18:51.764 --> 18:55.468
Where you're about to be
is Patton Plame's love shack.

18:55.502 --> 18:58.438
Follow. It's where
the fun starts.

19:00.407 --> 19:02.575
Feel free to take
a seat there.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.377
Cushion's pure
Egyptian cotton.

19:04.411 --> 19:05.612
I'll stand.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.614
Patton, surveillance
footage.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.217
Fine, we'll skip
the foreplay,

19:10.250 --> 19:12.219
but just know you killing
the vibe here.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.387
All right, since we kept
getting delayed

19:14.421 --> 19:15.588
on getting
the port surveillance,

19:15.622 --> 19:17.224
I went looking in the cloud.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.925
All I had to do was extinguish
a few firewalls,

19:18.958 --> 19:20.927
tee up the video,

19:20.960 --> 19:22.929
there he is--

19:22.962 --> 19:24.464
Petty Officer Hanson.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.667
Fast-forward to the time
of the murder, 3:30 a.m.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.436
Warp speed ahead.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.704
Wait a minute, whoa,
that's interesting.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.407
3:26.

19:35.475 --> 19:36.843
That's...

19:36.876 --> 19:38.645
That was the last frame.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.480
Erased?

19:40.513 --> 19:41.614
The rest of the night?

19:41.648 --> 19:42.615
PATTON:
Yeah.

19:42.649 --> 19:44.584
Hang on.
Give me a moment.

19:44.617 --> 19:47.720
Looks like whoever did this
left a hell of a fingerprint.

19:47.754 --> 19:50.257
Traced back
the IP address

19:50.290 --> 19:52.259
to none other than...

19:53.493 --> 19:55.662
...yard manager,
Jonathan Warren.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.630
Guy we talked to at the docks.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.799
The guy that promised the
footage but never delivered.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.401
Where can we
find Warren?

20:01.434 --> 20:02.435
WADE:
Got called by JPSO.

20:02.469 --> 20:03.836
When they told me

20:03.870 --> 20:05.772
it was Warren,
I knew to notify you.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.911
Small caliber round
to the skull.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.913
Working on time
of death.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.915
LASALLE:
Ready for this?

20:15.948 --> 20:18.718
Series of texts
from a blocked phone.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.019
All five-digit
numbers.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.021
Container numbers.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.023
Ran a check.
All are ghosts.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.859
And the last
one, 28871,

20:26.893 --> 20:30.463
that's the container Ekpo
and Turay came out of.

20:30.497 --> 20:33.700
So Warren got
the numbers,

20:33.733 --> 20:38.605
made sure the contraband made it
through the port undetected

20:38.638 --> 20:41.274
but showed up late
for his final job.

20:41.308 --> 20:42.909
Yeah, Hanson got
in the way,

20:42.942 --> 20:45.545
so Ekpo took care of him.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.414
And then when we started
sniffing around...

20:48.681 --> 20:50.483
Then Warren became
another loose end

20:50.517 --> 20:51.684
that needed to be tied.

20:51.718 --> 20:54.354
Time of death?

20:54.387 --> 20:57.990
It's a rough guess, but
somewhere between 2:30 and 2:45.

20:58.024 --> 21:00.860
BOLO on Warren
went out at 1:00.

21:00.893 --> 21:03.830
And Warren's dead an
hour and a half later.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.998
Mole's still one step ahead.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.802
Get a hold of Brody.

21:11.738 --> 21:14.507
See if she's got any information
on the Renegades' targets.

21:15.575 --> 21:17.677
Dwayne.

21:19.746 --> 21:23.550
Every story of ruin starts
with men building walls.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.552
Taller and wider.

21:25.585 --> 21:28.555
To keep out
the invaders.

21:28.588 --> 21:31.524
But cities don't collapse
from the outside.

21:31.558 --> 21:34.861
They're taken down
from someone on the inside.

21:34.894 --> 21:37.530
Iago, Brutus, Judas.

21:37.564 --> 21:39.732
Traitors, all.

21:39.766 --> 21:42.702
If we don't figure out
who ours is,

21:42.735 --> 21:44.904
we don't have a chance
against Ekpo.

21:44.937 --> 21:46.906
LASALLE:
Sorry to interrupt.

21:46.939 --> 21:48.975
Brody just got some
background on our vic.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.610
You're never gonna guess

21:50.643 --> 21:52.445
who appointed Warren
Port Commission.

21:52.479 --> 21:53.813
Who?

21:53.846 --> 21:55.448
Well, yeah, I mean,

21:55.482 --> 21:56.649
if we can get young Leroy
on our side,

21:56.683 --> 21:58.084
we'll have majority.

21:58.117 --> 22:00.687
Absolute...

22:00.720 --> 22:03.490
Douglas will call
you back.

22:03.523 --> 22:06.058
Well, if I'd known you were
gonna join me for lunch,

22:06.092 --> 22:07.927
I would have ordered
you the salmon.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.130
And who's this
poor soul?

22:11.163 --> 22:13.666
Someone you had appointed
to the Port Commission.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.502
I appoint lots
of people.

22:15.535 --> 22:16.736
It's part of the job.

22:16.769 --> 22:20.373
Yeah, well, this appointee
let in a terrorist.

22:21.608 --> 22:23.576
So whether you knew
about it or not,

22:23.610 --> 22:26.479
you got blood
on your hands.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.882
I'm gonna tell
you something.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.152
Do I appoint people
I don't know

22:33.185 --> 22:34.587
to repay favors?

22:34.621 --> 22:36.623
Yes. Oh, yes, all the time.

22:36.656 --> 22:37.957
Happens all the time.

22:37.990 --> 22:40.660
But what you are
accusing me of,

22:40.693 --> 22:42.028
compromising our city,

22:42.061 --> 22:44.731
is something that
my father would do.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.768
And I am not
my father.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.770
Prove it.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.739
Once and for all.

22:54.774 --> 22:57.710
If someone paid
my campaign cash

22:57.744 --> 23:01.748
to put this
man in office,

23:01.781 --> 23:03.950
then I will grant you
access to anything.

23:03.983 --> 23:05.952
You can have my financials,
my donor lists,

23:05.985 --> 23:08.588
anything you want,
but I'm telling you,

23:08.621 --> 23:11.658
I do not know the name of the
person you're looking for.

23:18.164 --> 23:19.966
PATTON:
Hey, Pride!

23:19.999 --> 23:21.968
Hold up.

23:22.001 --> 23:24.471
All right, I'll
push, you talk.

23:24.504 --> 23:25.672
I'm in a hurry.

23:25.705 --> 23:26.673
Thank you.

23:26.706 --> 23:27.740
Hey, man.

23:27.774 --> 23:29.476
Yesterday,
Yeah.

23:29.509 --> 23:31.911
our ATF friend Sonja and I
was in my office talking.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.746
I left to hit
the head.

23:33.780 --> 23:36.048
While I was gone, she
used my log-in I.D.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.917
to get into
our system.
What for?

23:37.950 --> 23:39.986
Still searching. But...

23:40.019 --> 23:41.788
But no classified
files were breached.

23:41.821 --> 23:43.490
Look, man.

23:43.523 --> 23:45.825
I don't think this is
connected to the mole issue.

23:45.858 --> 23:47.059
Percy's good people.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.528
Seeing what's
going on around here,

23:48.561 --> 23:49.696
you thought I should know.

23:53.065 --> 23:54.867
Thanks for the heads-up.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.703
You good?

23:56.736 --> 23:57.904
Yeah, I'm good.
Where you going?

23:57.937 --> 23:59.572
Business.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.207
CASSIUS:
This is Hamilton's donor list?

24:01.240 --> 24:03.042
Hundreds of names.

24:03.075 --> 24:05.044
Families.

24:05.077 --> 24:07.046
Judges, lawyers.

24:07.079 --> 24:08.681
Connections I'm...
Shh...

24:08.715 --> 24:10.517
trying to make
sense of.
All right.

24:10.550 --> 24:13.052
Just let the bad man
do his work here.

24:14.621 --> 24:16.823
I got a hunch now, but...

24:16.856 --> 24:18.591
a hunch is no good without...

24:19.892 --> 24:21.694
...without the proof.

24:21.728 --> 24:22.695
What?

24:22.729 --> 24:24.631
Hunch just
became fact.

24:26.198 --> 24:28.100
Who is Suzy Rivard?

24:28.134 --> 24:30.770
Suzy's second husband
is Johnny Rivard,

24:30.803 --> 24:33.039
and he's in here
with me right now.

24:33.072 --> 24:35.041
Few months back,
he got a window cell,

24:35.074 --> 24:37.043
and there's only four of them
in the whole damn prison.

24:37.076 --> 24:39.045
Only way you can get that
is with a bribe.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.880
This has a point, yes?

24:40.913 --> 24:42.749
Rivards don't have
any money,

24:42.782 --> 24:45.785
yet somehow Johnny's lady
got the cash to donate

24:45.818 --> 24:49.922
to Hamilton and get her
dim

24:49.956 --> 24:52.925
She asked for Warren
to get appointed.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.794
She's our mole.

24:54.827 --> 24:58.698
Your mole is the one who is
filling up her bank account.

25:00.032 --> 25:02.935
Now, ask me Suzy's
maiden name.

25:05.304 --> 25:06.873
Well, come on, ask.

25:06.906 --> 25:08.741
It's more fun that way.

25:08.775 --> 25:11.578
What is Suzy Rivard's
maiden name?

25:11.611 --> 25:13.245
Messier.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.183
Jim Messier.

25:17.216 --> 25:20.152
Suzy Rivard is his mama.

25:20.186 --> 25:24.924
Messier didn't want anyone
tracing his name back to Warren.

25:24.957 --> 25:28.928
So he had his mama
give the cash to Hamilton

25:28.961 --> 25:30.863
and gets Warren appointed.

25:30.897 --> 25:34.100
Messier knew about the
transfer of Baitfish...

25:36.235 --> 25:39.038
...ran in the same circles
as Sasha Broussard,

25:39.071 --> 25:40.907
had jurisdiction
over the port.

25:44.911 --> 25:46.913
Done good, Cassius.

25:46.946 --> 25:49.782
Maybe not such
a bad man after all, huh?

26:03.830 --> 26:06.098
Need to find
a safe place for that.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.134
I got it.
Chris.

26:08.167 --> 26:10.136
Look, this is mine, okay?

26:10.169 --> 26:11.971
I got to deal with
this, not you.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.940
Talking helps.

26:13.973 --> 26:16.142
I'm not sure it does.

26:16.175 --> 26:18.144
Patton tracked
Messier's phone.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.780
Got us a location.

26:20.813 --> 26:21.981
LASALLE:
Blue Grass Inn?

26:22.014 --> 26:24.150
Yeah, shut down
five years back.

26:24.183 --> 26:25.652
Two points of entry.

26:25.685 --> 26:27.286
JPSO will meet us for support.

26:27.319 --> 26:29.288
We'll approach
from the front.

26:29.321 --> 26:31.090
Lot of exposure
to the back.

26:31.123 --> 26:33.660
Deputies and I will cover
that side, scoop up anyone

26:33.693 --> 26:35.261
you guys flush out.
Good idea.

26:35.294 --> 26:38.264
Patton will keep track
of Messier's signal,

26:38.297 --> 26:40.266
lead us over the comms.

26:40.299 --> 26:41.267
You ready?

26:41.300 --> 26:42.869
Ready.

26:42.902 --> 26:45.738
Let's go roll this
piece of scum up.

26:45.772 --> 26:47.373
I got the layout in front of me.

26:47.406 --> 26:48.841
Tracking your position.

26:48.875 --> 26:50.877
BRODY:
Tactical team on the move.

26:52.779 --> 26:54.113
Take the first hallway
to your left.

27:06.826 --> 27:08.861
Directly across the courtyard,
up the stairs.

27:08.895 --> 27:10.062
Room 75.

27:38.024 --> 27:40.126
Messier's here.
Brody, call the paramedics.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.694
Who did this to you?

27:41.728 --> 27:42.929
Who did it to you?!

27:42.962 --> 27:44.296
Bastard with a tattoo.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.365
I smell gas.

27:47.466 --> 27:48.868
This guy?

27:49.435 --> 27:51.037
Yeah.

27:51.070 --> 27:53.472
Dwayne, I never meant for this.

27:53.505 --> 27:56.008
King, there's a
trigger mechanism.

27:56.042 --> 27:57.844
This place is
gonna blow.

27:57.877 --> 27:59.846
Brody, the room's hot--
get everybody back.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.013
Go on, get out.

28:02.949 --> 28:04.350
Go on. I'll take care of him.

28:04.383 --> 28:06.018
Like hell.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.092
Come on.

28:35.514 --> 28:37.116
Where's Ekpo
and Turay?

28:37.149 --> 28:39.151
I don't know.

28:39.185 --> 28:41.954
You killed Baitfish
to keep the ports open,

28:41.988 --> 28:43.455
to let
the terrorists in.

28:43.489 --> 28:45.291
It's not like that.
:
Oh...

28:45.324 --> 28:47.927
Sasha seduced me,

28:47.960 --> 28:49.929
made me an offer,

28:49.962 --> 28:51.097
more money than
I'd ever seen.

28:51.130 --> 28:54.066
I'd get crate numbers,

28:54.100 --> 28:56.068
give them to Warren
to let them through.

28:56.102 --> 29:00.072
But, I swear, I didn't
know what was in this one.

29:00.106 --> 29:02.208
Warren screwed up.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.243
Couldn't risk him talking.

29:05.978 --> 29:07.947
As he begged for his life,

29:07.980 --> 29:09.949
he told me who he'd let in.

29:09.982 --> 29:12.151
Expect me
to believe that?

29:12.184 --> 29:15.154
Doesn't really matter what
you believe anymore, does it?

29:15.187 --> 29:17.990
Excuse me.
Need to take him.

29:18.024 --> 29:20.927
Bank or banker.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.328
Heard him say it
a couple of times.

29:22.361 --> 29:25.264
LASALLE: Hey, Pride,
I got something here.

29:25.297 --> 29:28.467
Pulled a couple things from the
room that might be of interest.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.036
This made it
through the explosion.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.838
Built to withstand heat.
PRIDE: What is it?

29:31.871 --> 29:35.207
DM51. The canister's
ballistics-grade.

29:35.241 --> 29:36.342
What about the filaments?

29:36.375 --> 29:38.577
No clue there.
Brody?

29:38.610 --> 29:41.580
Turns out terrorists and
my father have similar taste.

29:41.613 --> 29:45.117
SD card reader, transfers photos
onto your computer.

29:45.151 --> 29:46.853
Same one I got last Christmas.

29:46.886 --> 29:48.287
It's no good without the card.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.288
One gig backup storage.

29:49.321 --> 29:50.589
Dad says it's a value buy.

29:50.622 --> 29:53.826
If Ekpo's taking photos,
I need to know of what.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.862
Figure that out...
We'll know where he's been.

29:55.895 --> 29:57.263
Or, even better,
where he's going.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.865
Get the canister
to Sebastian,

29:58.898 --> 30:00.132
the reader to Patton.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.333
Tell them...

30:01.367 --> 30:03.002
LASALLE and BRODY:
To learn things.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.978
SONJA:
Looks kind of like a Monet.

30:12.011 --> 30:13.279
Ekpo's photo files,
burnt to hell.

30:13.312 --> 30:14.981
I can't make out
a damn thing.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.282
Want some help?

30:16.315 --> 30:18.450
Think you helped yourself
to enough already.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.352
I can explain.

30:20.386 --> 30:22.855
Look, it's not my
business, really.

30:22.889 --> 30:24.156
I just passed along
what I found,

30:24.190 --> 30:26.092
now you got to take it
up with the big guy.

30:28.227 --> 30:30.429
Wait. Back up.

30:31.530 --> 30:32.398
Blow that up.

30:34.366 --> 30:37.236
It's a handle of a saber.
You see that?

30:37.269 --> 30:39.571
It's from a mural on
the containment wall

30:39.605 --> 30:42.274
of the Naval Operational
Support Center in Baton Rouge.

30:42.308 --> 30:43.943
Pass it every Sunday on my way

30:43.976 --> 30:45.344
to the farmers' market
in Livingston.

30:45.377 --> 30:47.013
You drive two hours for produce?

30:47.046 --> 30:48.614
Hey, kale is
important to me.

30:48.647 --> 30:51.250
Look, if this base
is their target...

30:51.283 --> 30:53.252
Hundreds of servicemen's
lives is at stake.

30:53.285 --> 30:55.387
Yeah.
I got to let Pride know.

30:57.123 --> 30:58.290
Oh.

30:58.324 --> 31:01.160
And just so you know,
I vouched for you.

31:05.297 --> 31:07.266
WOMAN:
Command is on lockdown.

31:07.299 --> 31:09.268
Had our security watch team
canvass the base for breaches,

31:09.301 --> 31:11.203
learned we'd
already been hit.
Attack?

31:11.237 --> 31:13.205
Not exactly.

31:13.239 --> 31:14.640
Couple hours back, the
roving sentry found

31:14.673 --> 31:16.275
the rear-access
door broken in.

31:16.308 --> 31:17.643
Carry on.

31:17.676 --> 31:20.279
This is where you keep
deactivated Navy weaponry?

31:20.312 --> 31:22.348
Yes, before they're shipped
to Defense Logistics.

31:22.381 --> 31:25.184
.30 caliber Browning
machine gun,

31:25.217 --> 31:28.520
AT4 and M72 rocket launchers,

31:28.554 --> 31:30.622
and then here...

31:32.458 --> 31:34.360
...M252 mortar.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.429
Last night, there were two.

31:39.331 --> 31:41.968
LASALLE: Cannon's got
a range of 3.7 miles,

31:42.001 --> 31:44.403
fires 81-millimeter
mortar rounds,

31:44.436 --> 31:46.238
burst radius of 40 meters.

31:46.272 --> 31:48.407
It's enough boom to take out
an entire city block.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.609
But our missing mortar launcher
doesn't have a firing pin.

31:50.642 --> 31:52.278
Which you could
work around,

31:52.311 --> 31:55.314
but, even so, can't be fired
without propellant charges.

31:55.347 --> 31:56.548
Unless they already
got 'em.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.384
Just off ATF's wire,

31:58.417 --> 31:59.986
four rings of M220
propellant was stolen

32:00.019 --> 32:01.420
from Dinex Munitions
in St. George.

32:01.453 --> 32:03.289
If Ekpo's got the propellant...

32:03.322 --> 32:04.957
Mortar's operable.

32:04.991 --> 32:06.959
SONJA: Wordy and Nerdy's
back with the hand raise.

32:06.993 --> 32:08.594
All right, notify
Homeland Security.

32:08.627 --> 32:09.996
And FBI.

32:10.029 --> 32:11.630
Pulling up a map
of sensitive targets

32:11.663 --> 32:13.299
within a 200-mile radius.

32:13.332 --> 32:16.135
We are in the dark.

32:16.168 --> 32:18.137
City more at risk than ever.

32:19.338 --> 32:20.406
SEBASTIAN:
Steel can,

32:20.439 --> 32:22.074
utterly fire-resistant,

32:22.108 --> 32:23.475
able to withstand
extreme pressure,

32:23.509 --> 32:26.078
and the strings are
carbon fiber filaments,

32:26.112 --> 32:27.546
conduct electricity.

32:27.579 --> 32:30.116
You put 'em both together,
you get a blackout bomb.

32:30.149 --> 32:32.118
Now, blackout bombs were
first used by the U.S.

32:32.151 --> 32:33.319
in the Gulf War.

32:33.352 --> 32:34.720
They targeted Iraq's
main power facility.

32:34.753 --> 32:36.122
The whole country
went dark.

32:36.155 --> 32:38.290
All this for a power outage?

32:38.324 --> 32:39.658
All this for Chernobyl.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.394
Cans are packed
into a mortar shell

32:42.428 --> 32:44.430
that's launched
at a nuclear generator.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.232
Once the shells reach
a certain altitude,

32:46.265 --> 32:47.633
the cans open,

32:47.666 --> 32:49.301
releasing a dense cloud
of razor-thin filaments.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.203
Those filaments slide
into the grid,

32:51.237 --> 32:52.204
create mini electrical fires,

32:52.238 --> 32:55.374
work their way back to the core,
cause meltdowns.

32:55.407 --> 32:58.444
How many nuclear plants
along the Mississippi watershed?

32:58.477 --> 32:59.678
Twenty-one.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.413
But there are five
in the immediate area.

33:01.447 --> 33:03.349
One of those gets hit,

33:03.382 --> 33:04.583
the runoff contaminates
the whole waterway.

33:04.616 --> 33:07.253
Radiation poisoning
up and down the river.

33:07.286 --> 33:10.189
Tens of thousands
of people exposed.

33:10.222 --> 33:14.126
"What you take from us,
we take from you."

33:14.160 --> 33:16.428
We don't figure out
what the target is,

33:16.462 --> 33:18.164
Ekpo's prophecy comes true.

33:29.075 --> 33:30.342
Nuclear Support Team
is being assembled.

33:30.376 --> 33:32.378
Where you at?
Given the amount
of propellant,

33:32.411 --> 33:34.746
Ekpo would have to be
within a mile of a reactor

33:34.780 --> 33:36.182
to hit his target.

33:36.215 --> 33:37.516
Security perimeters
have been set up

33:37.549 --> 33:39.418
in a four-mile radius
of the generators, so...

33:39.451 --> 33:41.487
it's hard to see how
he pulls this off.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.754
He wouldn't have come
all this way

33:42.788 --> 33:44.523
if he didn't have a plan.

33:44.556 --> 33:46.692
Roads are blocked...
no-fly zone in place.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.160
Boat?

33:48.194 --> 33:49.428
Wobbles too much.

33:49.461 --> 33:51.530
Tides make launching anything
impossible.

33:51.563 --> 33:52.798
What about...

33:52.831 --> 33:54.333
an island?

33:54.366 --> 33:55.601
There's dozens of them.

33:55.634 --> 33:56.835
Peak, Satchwan,

33:56.868 --> 33:58.804
Bankers, Milton...

33:58.837 --> 34:00.239
Bank...

34:00.272 --> 34:01.507
Bankers.

34:01.540 --> 34:02.841
Messier said

34:02.874 --> 34:05.477
they kept saying that word.

34:05.511 --> 34:08.647
How far is Bankers Island
from the nearest generator?

34:12.418 --> 34:14.486
Less than a quarter
of a mile from...

34:14.520 --> 34:16.555
Greybridge Energy
Nuclear Power Facility.

34:16.588 --> 34:18.490
Same company whose pipeline fire

34:18.524 --> 34:21.127
killed Ekpo's
family.
Let's gear up.

34:27.199 --> 34:29.101
Less than a minute out.

34:29.135 --> 34:30.369
Coast Guard?

34:30.402 --> 34:32.404
On their way.
JPSO, too.

34:32.438 --> 34:34.340
They'll be here
in 20 minutes.

34:34.373 --> 34:35.474
We're not waiting.

34:37.643 --> 34:39.345
All right.

34:39.378 --> 34:41.413
Island's two square miles.

34:41.447 --> 34:42.548
Gotta move fast and quiet.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.616
We got the island,
you got the shoreline.

34:44.650 --> 34:46.785
Anybody spots Ekpo
or his partner,

34:46.818 --> 34:48.187
radio for help.

34:48.220 --> 34:49.788
Everyone there at HQ?

34:49.821 --> 34:51.757
Standing by to support you
like an underwire bra.

34:51.790 --> 34:54.460
I... I raise my hand, and
it's the end of the world,

34:54.493 --> 34:55.627
and somehow
that's appropriate?

34:55.661 --> 34:57.563
Underwire's
a serious back saver.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.498
Don't knock it till you try it.

35:16.182 --> 35:18.350
Nothing on the south side.
We'll circle back.

35:24.223 --> 35:25.791
Got it.

35:27.526 --> 35:28.860
Mortar launcher.

35:28.894 --> 35:30.529
Right by the lake.

35:32.198 --> 35:33.665
Dead east
of the boat landing.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.534
We're five minutes out.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.469
Headed back your way now, King.

35:39.571 --> 35:41.507
I got the launcher,
but no sign of any of the...

35:43.709 --> 35:44.943
PRIDE:
I'm taking fire!

35:44.976 --> 35:46.878
Hold tight!

35:46.912 --> 35:48.580
Lasalle, keep due east. You're
about a quarter of a mile out.

36:06.732 --> 36:08.434
King. King, you all right?

36:08.467 --> 36:10.636
I'm fine.

36:15.741 --> 36:17.476
I'm fine.

36:20.646 --> 36:22.648
Turay's down.

36:25.617 --> 36:26.785
You gotta find Ekpo.

36:26.818 --> 36:27.819
On it.

36:33.625 --> 36:35.361
Patton.

36:35.394 --> 36:36.628
Sending you a photo.

36:38.630 --> 36:40.732
Found their landing point.

36:40.766 --> 36:42.000
No sign of our man.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.802
All right, keep looking.

36:43.835 --> 36:45.671
Patton, talk to me.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.639
PATTON:
That's an RF transmitter.

36:47.673 --> 36:49.675
With an SW-1
trigger mechanism.

36:49.708 --> 36:50.676
Meaning?

36:50.709 --> 36:51.677
Firing pin has been replaced

36:51.710 --> 36:52.878
with a remote detonator.

36:52.911 --> 36:54.680
Hell, Ekpo must have it.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.582
You can dismantle
that transmitter

36:56.615 --> 36:57.716
by removing the encoder chip...

36:57.749 --> 36:59.585
And the 18-pin dill socket.

36:59.618 --> 37:00.919
Find the blue wire
and yank it out.

37:01.953 --> 37:02.954
I got this.

37:25.344 --> 37:26.578
No.

37:26.612 --> 37:27.646
Too late, Ekpo.

37:27.679 --> 37:29.615
What did you do?

37:29.648 --> 37:32.784
Firing the bomb...

37:32.818 --> 37:35.487
wouldn't have ever
brought your family back.

37:36.688 --> 37:38.690
Do you have a family?

37:40.726 --> 37:43.529
Then they will feel the pain
that I do.

37:51.970 --> 37:54.673
BRODY:
Pride! Lasalle! You guys okay?

37:58.076 --> 38:00.045
Better now.

38:10.055 --> 38:11.857
This reminds me of
picking snow peas

38:11.890 --> 38:13.592
with you when
you were a kid.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.627
Except I don't remember the...

38:15.661 --> 38:17.663
barbed wire or
the armed guards.

38:17.696 --> 38:19.698
And I don't remember you ever
getting beat up like that.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.634
But I heard you done good,
though.

38:22.668 --> 38:25.003
With your help.

38:28.740 --> 38:30.676
Ask me what's in here.

38:32.110 --> 38:34.079
More fun that way.

38:34.112 --> 38:35.914
Copycat.

38:38.450 --> 38:40.051
Letter to the parole board.

38:40.085 --> 38:42.588
Highlighting
what you done

38:42.621 --> 38:44.756
and giving my support

38:44.790 --> 38:47.325
to watch over you,
should they grant release.

38:48.860 --> 38:51.897
Might be time you came home.

38:51.930 --> 38:53.799
I could be helpful to you.

38:53.832 --> 38:57.736
Give you an insight into
the makings of a corrupt mind.

39:00.639 --> 39:02.841
Thank... thank you,
thank you, son.

39:12.150 --> 39:14.586
Think I might even look good
with a badge.

39:15.887 --> 39:17.456
Don't get ahead
of yourself, Dad.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.667
That's better.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.570
Wanted to see me?

39:31.603 --> 39:32.871
You lied
about getting permission

39:32.904 --> 39:34.740
from your resident in charge.

39:36.442 --> 39:38.844
And you hacked into our budget?

39:38.877 --> 39:40.846
I...

39:40.879 --> 39:43.114
I wanted to see if...

39:43.148 --> 39:45.851
you had room for another agent.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.988
Why not just ask?

39:50.021 --> 39:51.423
Because if you ask,

39:51.457 --> 39:53.024
sometimes people say no.

39:53.058 --> 39:55.894
"Better to put your head down
and just barge in."

39:55.927 --> 39:57.796
Exactly.

39:58.897 --> 40:01.166
I've been working on my own
for so long,

40:01.199 --> 40:04.703
and with everything
that we've gotten done...

40:04.736 --> 40:06.838
I'm just thinking
there's some appeal.

40:06.872 --> 40:08.840
Be part of a family.

40:08.874 --> 40:11.510
This family.

40:11.543 --> 40:12.778
Your family.

40:16.181 --> 40:17.916
Okay, Lasalle.

40:17.949 --> 40:19.451
Let me see it.

40:19.485 --> 40:21.152
What?
The medallion.

40:21.186 --> 40:23.054
Brody...

40:23.088 --> 40:24.890
I am not taking no
for an answer.

40:33.198 --> 40:34.866
Thank you.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.003
So, this...

40:38.036 --> 40:39.805
was my sister's.

40:39.838 --> 40:42.508
Bought it from
this Gypsy lady

40:42.541 --> 40:44.943
on our Europe trip;
she said it was good luck.

40:46.878 --> 40:48.580
She never took it off.

40:50.682 --> 40:53.619
And now this...

40:53.652 --> 40:55.654
will not get lost.

40:55.687 --> 40:57.856
I can't.

41:00.992 --> 41:02.961
You and Pride have been
amazing to me.

41:04.863 --> 41:07.032
Made me feel like...

41:07.065 --> 41:09.868
I'm home.

41:09.901 --> 41:13.271
And, uh... I, uh...

41:13.304 --> 41:15.273
I hadn't felt that
since I lost her.

41:15.306 --> 41:18.176
So I would be honored

41:18.209 --> 41:20.912
if you would please wear this.

41:23.181 --> 41:25.517
PRIDE:
Let's gather everybody up!

41:26.852 --> 41:28.754
SCIF room again?

41:28.787 --> 41:31.857
Not exactly.

41:31.890 --> 41:34.760
BRODY:
What's going on?

41:34.793 --> 41:36.562
I just think that
raising your hand

41:36.595 --> 41:38.664
is a basic foundation of
all modern civilization.

41:38.697 --> 41:40.666
A grown-ass man
raising your hand?

41:40.699 --> 41:42.668
That's worse than your
moon landing conspiracy.

41:42.701 --> 41:44.069
That flag is flapping
in the breeze, man.

41:44.102 --> 41:45.136
That's fundamentally
impossible!

41:45.170 --> 41:46.304
PATTON:
Oh, come on.

41:46.337 --> 41:47.673
That's attractive to you?

41:47.706 --> 41:48.974
Sense of humor,
top of my list.

41:49.007 --> 41:50.976
Lasalle knows a bunch
of knock-knock jokes.

41:51.009 --> 41:52.043
Tell her one.

41:52.077 --> 41:53.812
PRIDE:
Loretta...

41:53.845 --> 41:55.581
Sazerac...
light on the bitters.

41:55.614 --> 41:56.848
Oh, you never forget.

42:03.889 --> 42:05.991
They're safe for tonight.

42:06.024 --> 42:07.926
Tonight.

42:07.959 --> 42:09.961
Tomorrow is
another story.

42:11.830 --> 42:13.832
This city.

42:15.133 --> 42:17.035
One of a kind.

42:17.068 --> 42:21.640
* To the ends of the Earth
would you follow me? *

42:24.042 --> 42:28.146
* There's a world that was meant
for our eyes to see... *
