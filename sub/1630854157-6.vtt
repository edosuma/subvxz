That's usually my line,
but whatever.

19:28.910 --> 19:31.502
(straining, grunting)

19:35.991 --> 19:38.176
(cries out)

19:38.327 --> 19:40.011
-(groaning)
-(crackling)

19:40.922 --> 19:43.097
(groaning)

19:45.000 --> 19:47.185
Wilma!

19:51.766 --> 19:52.915
(hissing)

19:52.934 --> 19:54.358
(gasps)

19:55.603 --> 19:58.196
You saved us, Peter.

19:59.032 --> 20:01.032
Yeah, glad you thought of it.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.700
I hate this place.

20:02.927 --> 20:04.260
Of course I did.

20:04.278 --> 20:05.369
I love you guys.

20:05.596 --> 20:07.872
And from now on,
I'll try to be half as good

20:08.099 --> 20:09.373
as Hologram Me was.

20:09.450 --> 20:11.116
Oh, but don't you see, Peter?

20:11.211 --> 20:13.211
The hologram was you.

20:13.362 --> 20:15.028
He was just
the best version of you.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.215
You can get there,
it'll just take work.

20:17.442 --> 20:20.367
No, the deal was
I promise to be half as good

20:20.386 --> 20:21.460
as a fake thing.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.262
-All right, just do that.
-No promises.

20:29.136 --> 20:31.211
Well, Peter,
I'm glad you're safe,

20:31.231 --> 20:32.879
and everything's back to normal.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.291
Yeah. Me, too.
And you know what?

20:35.309 --> 20:37.309
I realized
how much I missed you guys.

20:37.462 --> 20:39.295
What do you say
we turn off that TV

20:39.313 --> 20:40.813
and do something as a family?

20:40.907 --> 20:42.240
-(all gasp)
-Damn it.

20:42.391 --> 20:44.133
He created another hologram.

20:44.226 --> 20:46.077
(sighs)
I'll get my feet started.

20:46.228 --> 20:48.821
-Brian, little "Camptown Races"?
-You got it.

20:48.973 --> 20:50.414
♪<i> Da da ladies sing this song</i> ♪

20:50.583 --> 20:53.142
-I just gave you the title!
-Sorry, uh...

20:53.160 --> 20:55.144

20:55.162 --> 20:56.979
-♪<i> Da da--</i> ♪

20:56.998 --> 20:57.997
At least I got one of 'em.

20:58.149 --> 20:59.632
The second one doesn't count!
