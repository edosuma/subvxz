00:00.845 --> 00:03.050
Now you're gonna see me
fight for my child.

00:03.070 --> 00:05.121
You just messed with the wrong mother.

00:05.141 --> 00:06.693
<i>Previously on "Mistresses"...</i>

00:06.713 --> 00:09.028
- I'm Joss' ex.
- Ex?

00:09.226 --> 00:11.895
It's messy. This has
to be goodbye, right?

00:11.929 --> 00:14.964
Me and Sofia, we used to date.
There's nothing there anymore.

00:14.999 --> 00:16.566
It's purely professional.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.034
Lucy: Hey, Noel.

00:18.068 --> 00:19.903
I thought you weren't allowed
to hang around boys.

00:19.937 --> 00:21.008
I'm not.

00:21.028 --> 00:22.572
I'm not sure I'm so
good with this class.

00:22.606 --> 00:24.482
I'll go back to yoga and
Pilates just for you.

00:24.502 --> 00:25.508
Good.

00:25.543 --> 00:27.811
Don't leave me with him!

00:27.845 --> 00:29.913
[Gasps] [Grunting]

00:29.947 --> 00:31.681
[Screams]

00:31.715 --> 00:33.683
I suppose we should just
keep gambling, then, huh?

00:33.717 --> 00:36.186
- Sure.
- Come on.

00:36.220 --> 00:39.489
Let's go, baby. Give me something.

00:42.625 --> 00:45.428
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

00:45.462 --> 00:49.732
I'm sure you understand
how serious this is.

00:50.318 --> 00:53.380
Um... what do you mean?
How serious what is?

00:55.034 --> 00:56.335
You're kidding, right?

00:56.369 --> 00:58.771
You're saying you know
nothing about the incident

00:58.805 --> 01:00.840
in the hotel hallway in Vegas

01:00.874 --> 01:03.342
between Joss and my nephew, Reza?

01:03.376 --> 01:04.709
I'm sorry, Jonathan.

01:04.744 --> 01:06.236
I-I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:06.256 --> 01:08.207
There seems to have been an altercation.

01:08.227 --> 01:09.962
Reza was arguing with his girlfriend,

01:09.996 --> 01:14.962
and Joss misunderstood
what was going on, and...

01:14.982 --> 01:16.034
And?

01:16.069 --> 01:20.038
And in a misguided attempt
to protect the woman,

01:20.073 --> 01:22.104
Joss attacked Reza.

01:22.509 --> 01:23.882
Attacked?

01:24.278 --> 01:26.311
[Laughs] What do you mean "attacked"?

01:26.346 --> 01:27.980
She sent him to the hospital.

01:28.014 --> 01:30.870
He did his best to calm her
down and not to engage,

01:30.890 --> 01:33.318
but apparently, she was out of control.

01:33.353 --> 01:36.254
Okay. Wait a second.
Sorry. Um... [Chuckles]

01:36.289 --> 01:38.323
You're saying that
my fiancée and... and Reza

01:38.358 --> 01:40.859
got into a, what, like a fistfight?

01:42.528 --> 01:45.230
[Laughing] Oh, come on.
Jonathan, that is ridiculous.

01:45.264 --> 01:46.698
Yes, it is.

01:46.733 --> 01:48.500
And now I'm trying to figure out

01:48.534 --> 01:52.037
why one of my employees
left my favorite nephew

01:52.071 --> 01:54.539
bloody and bruised
with an injured elbow.

01:54.574 --> 01:57.009
Okay, there is no way
Joss would do that.

01:57.043 --> 01:58.710
I-It has to be a mistake.

01:58.745 --> 02:00.112
It isn't.

02:00.146 --> 02:02.180
And I don't appreciate the insinuation.

02:02.215 --> 02:04.683
So I suggest you speak to your fiancée

02:04.717 --> 02:06.685
before something else happens.

02:06.719 --> 02:10.088
- Are you threatening Joss?
- I'm not threatening anyone.

02:10.850 --> 02:13.759
I'm just saying that
this needs to get settled,

02:13.793 --> 02:16.261
one way or the other.

02:26.239 --> 02:28.473
Are you humming
the "Hamilton" soundtrack again?

02:28.508 --> 02:30.942
No, actually, I'm working
on my own thing.

02:30.977 --> 02:32.744
Sounds like "Hamilton" to me.

02:37.116 --> 02:38.417
Is that a...

02:38.451 --> 02:39.751
Condom.

02:39.786 --> 02:41.620
Seems like it.

02:44.397 --> 02:45.723
What? It's not mine.

02:45.743 --> 02:47.659
It fell out of Lucy's jacket!

02:47.693 --> 02:49.161
- Uh-oh.
- "Uh-oh"?

02:49.195 --> 02:51.163
That's all you have to say is "uh-oh"?

02:51.197 --> 02:53.565
There is gonna be a whole lot
more than "uh-oh" going on

02:53.599 --> 02:54.833
when I get my hands on her.

02:54.867 --> 02:57.102
- Whoa. Where you going?
- Pulling her out of school,

02:57.136 --> 02:59.738
and then I'm gonna beat
the crap out of that Noel kid.

02:59.772 --> 03:01.473
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

03:01.507 --> 03:03.809
You're not going anywhere in this state.

03:03.843 --> 03:05.510
What do you mean?
The kid from her debate class?

03:05.545 --> 03:08.080
- That Noel?
- Yep. This just reeks of Noel.

03:08.114 --> 03:09.672
How do you even know
what Noel smells like?

03:09.692 --> 03:11.834
- Th-This is no time to joke!
- Okay, look. Here's an idea.

03:11.854 --> 03:13.318
How about we have him over for dinner?

03:13.352 --> 03:15.120
And that way, you know
what you're dealing with.

03:15.154 --> 03:16.718
You think he's just gonna
tell us if they're having sex?

03:16.738 --> 03:18.257
Give me 20 minutes
in the room with them,

03:18.277 --> 03:19.621
and I will be able to tell.

03:19.641 --> 03:22.128
I have a kind of radar
for this sort of thing.

03:23.445 --> 03:24.482
Fine.

03:24.516 --> 03:26.584
Okay. 20 minutes.

03:26.618 --> 03:30.221
That's all you get.
And after that, he is all mine.

03:30.255 --> 03:31.556
[Scoffs]

03:32.591 --> 03:34.425
Vivian's finally asleep.

03:34.459 --> 03:37.559
Our pediatrician just thinks
she has a little cold.

03:38.445 --> 03:40.264
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

03:40.299 --> 03:42.166
Of course. I'm just
glad you reached out.

03:42.201 --> 03:45.069
I wasn't sure
you'd be up for it after...

03:45.103 --> 03:46.915
[Chuckles] Oh, come on.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.578
Just because Savi's run off to Bali

03:48.598 --> 03:50.208
doesn't mean I'm gonna
leave you all alone

03:50.242 --> 03:52.726
to fight your deadbeat
baby daddy in court.

03:52.746 --> 03:56.126
And you really think we have
a shot at sole physical custody?

03:56.146 --> 03:58.223
I mean, most family courts
start out favoring the mother,

03:58.243 --> 04:00.578
and considering Alec
didn't even see Vivian

04:00.612 --> 04:03.280
for the first four months,
well, let's just say

04:03.315 --> 04:05.549
it's not exactly an advertisement
for good parenting.

04:05.584 --> 04:06.929
Does he even have a case?

04:06.949 --> 04:09.003
There's always a case to be made.

04:09.023 --> 04:10.725
But they probably know
they're not gonna get

04:10.745 --> 04:11.978
everything they ask for.

04:12.013 --> 04:13.647
All the decision-making power

04:13.681 --> 04:16.916
and restricting me to supervised
visits? I would hope so.

04:16.951 --> 04:18.791
My guess is that they're
asking for a lot upfront

04:18.812 --> 04:21.254
so they can look like they're
making big concessions later on.

04:21.289 --> 04:23.323
So you think we can resolve everything

04:23.357 --> 04:26.107
at the meeting today
without going to court?

04:26.794 --> 04:28.094
Hopefully.

04:28.129 --> 04:30.030
But I just want you to be prepared

04:30.064 --> 04:31.698
that this could get ugly.

04:31.732 --> 04:34.568
Now, is there anything
that Alec might use against you

04:34.602 --> 04:36.303
that I should know about?

04:36.663 --> 04:38.738
So, I guess you didn't read my book.

04:38.773 --> 04:40.740
Mm, no.

04:40.775 --> 04:42.876
[Sighs] Well, it's a little blunt

04:42.910 --> 04:45.378
about some of the mistakes I've made.

04:45.413 --> 04:48.582
But everything in it happened
long before I had Vivian.

04:48.616 --> 04:51.816
Yeah, well, they're gonna
use it as much as possible.

04:52.056 --> 04:54.054
- [Sighs]
- Look.

04:54.088 --> 04:58.425
This may be a long, nasty fight, Karen.

04:58.459 --> 05:01.528
You're willing to stick it out?

05:01.562 --> 05:04.664
To the bitter end. Whatever it takes.

05:08.060 --> 05:10.136
Ugh.

05:10.156 --> 05:12.906
Brian and his new girlfriend are
running a marathon together.

05:12.940 --> 05:15.308
Wow. That is a lot of neon.

05:15.343 --> 05:17.477
You dodged a bullet, honey.
A big, bright bullet.

05:17.511 --> 05:18.612
I know.

05:18.646 --> 05:21.846
It's just been so hard
to get Brian out of my system.

05:23.773 --> 05:25.886
You did this once...
Broke off an engagement.

05:25.920 --> 05:29.422
What was his name? Uh... Scott?

05:29.457 --> 05:30.657
Yeah.

05:30.691 --> 05:32.792
Definitely not my awesomest moment.

05:32.827 --> 05:37.230
I, uh... I stood him up at
our wedding for your brother.

05:37.265 --> 05:39.232
Last I heard, he was
getting married, though,

05:39.267 --> 05:40.934
so hopefully he's happy now.

05:40.968 --> 05:43.103
So, he's... He's a good guy?

05:43.137 --> 05:45.866
Mm-hmm. Nothing wrong with him at all?

05:46.376 --> 05:47.674
Nope.

05:47.708 --> 05:50.713
Although he did have a bit of
a kink for women's footwear.

05:50.733 --> 05:52.979
My frickin' arches killed me
the whole time we were dating.

05:53.014 --> 05:55.882
Joss. Do you have a second?

05:56.884 --> 05:58.800
I'll be, uh...

05:58.820 --> 06:01.922
Bye. [Clears throat] Good talk.

06:03.190 --> 06:04.691
So I guess you know.

06:04.725 --> 06:07.093
That you got into a fight with
Jonathan's nephew in Las Vegas?

06:07.128 --> 06:08.528
Yeah, he just told me.

06:08.562 --> 06:10.630
- Did you get hurt?
- No, I'm fine. Really.

06:10.665 --> 06:12.432
- When did this happen?
- Just...

06:12.466 --> 06:15.335
Okay. Do you remember
when I went upstairs

06:15.369 --> 06:18.038
to change clothes before we were
gonna leave to get married?

06:18.072 --> 06:19.706
There was this guy down the hall,

06:19.740 --> 06:21.975
and he was trying to get
this woman into his hotel room.

06:22.009 --> 06:24.344
- Like, what, against her will?
- It was crazy.

06:24.378 --> 06:26.313
I mean, he basically
slammed her against the wall,

06:26.347 --> 06:28.495
and then she screamed for help, and
when I went over there to stop him,

06:28.515 --> 06:29.983
that's when I realized that it was Reza.

06:30.017 --> 06:31.851
According to Jonathan,
you did more than just stop him.

06:31.886 --> 06:34.721
Y-You put him in the hospital.

06:34.755 --> 06:37.023
So, why... why didn't you
tell me any of this?

06:37.058 --> 06:39.859
I don't know. Maybe because I
knew that it would, you know,

06:39.894 --> 06:41.394
complicate things with you and Jonathan,

06:41.429 --> 06:43.196
and, honestly, I just wanted
it to go away, Harry.

06:43.230 --> 06:44.798
Well, that certainly hasn't happened

06:44.832 --> 06:46.866
and, you know, it would
have been nice to know

06:46.901 --> 06:48.868
before Jonathan called me
into his office, Joss.

06:48.903 --> 06:50.003
I felt like an idiot.

06:50.037 --> 06:51.465
I'm sorry.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.407
Is that what this is?

06:54.442 --> 06:56.009
From punching Reza?

06:56.043 --> 06:58.712
Not from some accident,
like you told me.

06:58.746 --> 06:59.879
Yeah.

06:59.914 --> 07:02.582
Okay. So... [Scoffs]

07:02.616 --> 07:04.918
You... You didn't trust me
enough to say anything.

07:04.952 --> 07:06.553
No, that's not true, Harry.

07:06.587 --> 07:08.254
It's just... It's not that simple.

07:08.289 --> 07:10.657
Well, it seems simple, Joss.
You just tell me.

07:10.691 --> 07:14.561
What doesn't seem simple is how you
were able to beat up Reza so easily.

07:14.595 --> 07:15.929
[Sighs]

07:15.963 --> 07:17.330
Okay.

07:17.365 --> 07:19.332
Um, I never stopped going
to my Impact class.

07:19.367 --> 07:22.569
So, y-you lied to me
about stopping the class,

07:22.603 --> 07:24.871
you lied to me about the fight,
then you lied to me

07:24.905 --> 07:26.583
about why you didn't want
to get married that night.

07:26.603 --> 07:29.761
Joss, is... is there
anything you haven't
been lying to me about?

07:29.781 --> 07:31.444
- Harry...
- What is going on with you, Joss?

07:31.479 --> 07:32.445
Nothing is going on with me!

07:32.480 --> 07:35.254
I... I saw something,
and I reacted. I'm sorry.

07:35.274 --> 07:37.050
Well, that's great,
but I still have to figure out

07:37.084 --> 07:38.618
what I'm supposed to tell Jonathan,

07:38.652 --> 07:41.260
especially since he thinks
you attacked Reza unprovoked.

07:41.280 --> 07:43.523
Well, maybe try telling him
the truth, Harry.

07:43.557 --> 07:46.292
♪

07:49.296 --> 07:51.364
In addition, Faith is a pediatrician

07:51.399 --> 07:53.800
who plans to become
a full-time caregiver.

07:53.834 --> 07:55.969
That role in Karen's home
has already been filled

07:56.003 --> 07:58.071
by an endless rotation of nannies.

07:58.105 --> 08:00.907
Well, I imagine
a second caretaker was helpful

08:00.941 --> 08:02.706
after Vivian's father abandoned her.

08:02.726 --> 08:05.292
I only stayed away
because Karen asked me to

08:05.312 --> 08:06.946
and I wanted to respect her wishes.

08:06.980 --> 08:08.081
That's a lie.

08:08.115 --> 08:11.739
You chose to miss the first
four months of her life.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.437
You don't know the first
thing about Vivian.

08:13.457 --> 08:14.964
How dare you come here now

08:14.984 --> 08:17.051
and try to take her away from me.

08:18.692 --> 08:21.094
Vivian has just begun the most important

08:21.128 --> 08:23.229
developmental years of her life.

08:23.263 --> 08:24.997
It is vital that she be
in an environment

08:25.032 --> 08:28.404
where she will receive maximum
intellectual stimulation.

08:28.424 --> 08:29.435
What the hell is that?

08:29.470 --> 08:32.972
Look, I think we all want to
reach some kind of compromise

08:33.006 --> 08:35.741
so we can avoid a lengthy court process.

08:35.775 --> 08:37.844
I have no interest in compromising.

08:37.878 --> 08:39.846
You have no proof that Karen has been

08:39.880 --> 08:42.115
anything other than a perfect mother.

08:42.149 --> 08:44.751
Actually, I didn't want
to bring this up,

08:44.785 --> 08:46.686
but I assume you remember calling me

08:46.720 --> 08:48.650
when I was in Costa Rica?

08:48.670 --> 08:49.689
Calling you?

08:49.723 --> 08:51.157
When you were 12 weeks pregnant

08:51.191 --> 08:53.923
on the way to the doctor
to discuss an abortion?

08:55.696 --> 08:58.733
I'm not sure what
that has to do with this.

08:58.753 --> 09:00.133
I still have the voicemails,

09:00.153 --> 09:02.869
and they don't sugarcoat the fact
that you didn't want this baby

27:37.608 --> 27:39.797
You know, I'm... I'm so sorry, Jonathan.

27:39.831 --> 27:40.864
You think you're the good guy here,

27:40.899 --> 27:42.834
but you should know
that your nephew is the one

27:42.854 --> 27:44.668
who belongs in jail, which is
where he's gonna end up soon,

27:44.703 --> 27:46.768
given the coddling that's
happening in this family.

27:46.788 --> 27:48.639
- Excuse me?
- And that's the best-case scenario.

27:48.673 --> 27:50.674
Worse case scenario is
that this spoiled kid

27:50.709 --> 27:52.176
hurts or kills someone else.

27:52.210 --> 27:53.677
You know, I should have
taken care of you

27:53.712 --> 27:55.112
in that hallway
instead of not fighting back.

27:55.146 --> 27:56.847
Then we wouldn't have a problem here.

27:56.881 --> 27:58.338
Oh, please. You can't hurt me.

27:58.358 --> 27:59.850
You want to press charges,
go right ahead.

27:59.884 --> 28:01.652
I've done this before.
The truth always comes out.

28:01.686 --> 28:03.153
You know what you did.

28:03.188 --> 28:05.056
Think you can put me in jail?
Fine. Try it.

28:05.076 --> 28:07.091
I'll be waiting.

28:10.528 --> 28:11.762
Excuse me.

28:11.796 --> 28:13.761
How much longer will we have to wait?

28:13.781 --> 28:15.499
Well, there's still many people
ahead of your child

28:15.533 --> 28:17.835
with more serious symptoms.

28:17.869 --> 28:19.770
Actually, I'm a doctor,
and I can tell you

28:19.804 --> 28:21.546
that Vivian's symptoms
are quite serious.

28:21.566 --> 28:23.273
Man: Nurse, I need some help over here.

28:23.308 --> 28:25.676
- Have a seat. Someone will be with you.
- Wait. We're not done.

28:25.710 --> 28:27.444
Come back here! We're not done.

28:27.479 --> 28:29.346
[Scoffs]

28:32.517 --> 28:34.651
[Knock on door]

28:36.921 --> 28:40.891
- I didn't know where else to go.
- [Vivian cries]

28:45.190 --> 28:46.794
She's a little wheezy,
and it hasn't stopped.

28:46.829 --> 28:49.777
I think it's whooping
cough or pneumonia.

28:49.797 --> 28:51.297
And they wouldn't see her at the E.R.

28:51.332 --> 28:52.765
and I couldn't sit there for hours

28:52.800 --> 28:54.600
with a sick baby
breathing in those germs.

28:54.635 --> 28:57.570
Of course not. You're her mother.
You did the right thing for her.

28:57.604 --> 29:00.770
Do you want me to take a look at her?

29:01.765 --> 29:03.443
It is your specialty.

29:03.477 --> 29:04.744
Okay.

29:04.778 --> 29:05.845
Can you get me my bag?

29:05.879 --> 29:07.513
Of course. Yeah.

29:07.548 --> 29:09.115
I know.

29:09.149 --> 29:10.984
Okay.

29:11.018 --> 29:12.285
[Door opens]

29:12.319 --> 29:13.899
Joss: Hey.

29:14.154 --> 29:15.544
Hey.

29:17.232 --> 29:19.481
So, um, I just saw Reza.

29:19.501 --> 29:20.640
Again.

29:20.660 --> 29:22.561
I went to apologize.

29:22.595 --> 29:25.530
You did? Okay. Great.

29:25.565 --> 29:27.866
How'd it go?

29:27.900 --> 29:29.234
Well...

29:29.268 --> 29:30.902
Well?

29:30.937 --> 29:33.839
No. Um... not well.

29:33.873 --> 29:36.917
You know, Harry, I-I tried.
Really, I did.

29:36.937 --> 29:39.239
So, what? That... That's it?

29:39.273 --> 29:40.406
Now he's gonna press charges?

29:40.441 --> 29:42.542
- I don't know. Maybe.
- Joss...

29:42.576 --> 29:44.210
You know, they probably
won't do anything anyway.

29:44.245 --> 29:45.211
It would just be bad press for them.

29:45.246 --> 29:47.180
Hey, even if that's true,
how am I supposed

29:47.214 --> 29:50.025
to go back and work
with Jonathan after this?

29:50.045 --> 29:52.185
What? Why would you want to?

29:52.219 --> 29:54.921
- I mean, I'm not going to.
- Because it's my job, our livelihood.

29:54.955 --> 29:56.856
No, I get that, Harry,
but Jonathan is clearly

29:56.891 --> 29:58.324
a slimeball who's enabling this kid.

29:58.359 --> 30:00.493
Why would you want to work
with someone like that?

30:00.527 --> 30:01.594
Jonathan loves his family.

30:01.629 --> 30:03.029
That doesn't make him a slimeball.

30:03.063 --> 30:04.530
In fact, he's trying
to help the situation.

30:04.565 --> 30:05.999
And the fact that you'd do something

30:06.033 --> 30:08.201
to risk my entire career, Joss.

30:09.303 --> 30:11.371
Uh, wow.

30:11.405 --> 30:13.339
I'm sorry, Harry.

30:13.374 --> 30:15.467
I didn't mean to do that.

30:16.577 --> 30:19.078
Where is all this rage
coming from, Joss?

30:19.113 --> 30:20.880
[Sighs]

30:20.915 --> 30:22.682
Hey.

30:22.716 --> 30:23.850
Can we talk about it?

30:23.884 --> 30:25.905
[Gasps] No, you know what, Harry?
I'm just... I'm really...

30:25.925 --> 30:29.134
I think I'm all talked out
for the moment.

30:31.558 --> 30:33.059
It's not whooping cough.

30:33.093 --> 30:34.427
So it's pneumonia?

30:34.461 --> 30:36.930
A moderate case.
I have some amoxicillin on hand.

30:36.950 --> 30:38.731
I'm gonna give her 350 milligrams.

30:38.766 --> 30:40.633
- Sound good?
- Yeah.

30:40.668 --> 30:41.901
Perfect.

30:41.936 --> 30:43.636
Okay.

30:43.671 --> 30:46.472
We will be back.

30:46.507 --> 30:49.375
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

30:54.682 --> 30:58.318
I can't imagine how hard
it was for you, coming here.

30:58.352 --> 30:59.619
[Sighs]

30:59.653 --> 31:01.487
I owe you an apology.

31:01.522 --> 31:04.457
I'm the one who started all of this,
and you didn't deserve that.

31:04.491 --> 31:07.226
And I didn't mean all those
things that I said. I just...

31:07.261 --> 31:10.430
I got caught up in the moment.

31:10.464 --> 31:12.932
So I'm sorry.

31:12.967 --> 31:15.301
I appreciate that.

31:15.336 --> 31:18.237
This certainly isn't
how I expected things to go

31:18.272 --> 31:19.639
when you came back to town.

31:19.673 --> 31:22.241
[Chuckles] Me neither.

31:23.377 --> 31:29.282
And I think you were right,
about me blaming you.

31:29.316 --> 31:30.416
Really?

31:30.451 --> 31:33.419
Yeah, I think I was trying
to punish you in some way,

31:33.454 --> 31:36.622
but only 'cause I wanted
to punish myself.

31:36.657 --> 31:38.925
I felt guilty about leaving,
and I lashed out.

31:38.959 --> 31:41.127
I could tell how much
you cared about Vivian

31:41.161 --> 31:43.496
from the moment I saw you two together.

31:43.530 --> 31:47.533
So, maybe we can try
to work this out amicably?

31:47.568 --> 31:49.435
I'd like that.

31:49.470 --> 31:52.005
But I'd also like to be
a part of Vivian's life,

31:52.039 --> 31:53.606
if that's okay with you.

31:53.640 --> 31:55.508
Of course. I want you to be.

31:55.542 --> 31:58.778
It's what Vivian would have wanted.

32:00.647 --> 32:01.814
Yeah.

32:01.849 --> 32:02.949
[Footsteps approaching]

32:02.983 --> 32:04.617
She did great.

32:06.520 --> 32:08.454
[Giggles] She's gonna be just fine.

32:08.489 --> 32:09.989
Mm-hmm.

32:10.024 --> 32:13.493
Hello. Did you say "thank you"?

32:13.527 --> 32:14.694
Yeah?

32:19.833 --> 32:22.335
Harry. There you are.

32:22.369 --> 32:23.642
Whew.

32:23.662 --> 32:25.405
This... It's going to sound crazy,

32:25.439 --> 32:27.840
but you know how sometimes
the universe puts people

32:27.875 --> 32:29.409
in your path, and...

32:29.443 --> 32:31.444
Hey. Are you okay?

32:31.478 --> 32:35.581
Yeah. Yeah. No. I'm...
It's just more Joss stuff.

32:35.616 --> 32:38.718
You mean because she beat a guy
up and lied to you about it?

32:38.752 --> 32:42.321
Yeah, that, and now she wants
me to cut ties with Jonathan.

32:42.356 --> 32:44.357
What? Why? He didn't do anything.

32:44.391 --> 32:47.344
Yeah, I know, but it's his nephew.

32:47.364 --> 32:49.395
You know, I really don't want to give up

32:49.430 --> 32:52.231
everything I've been working
toward and start from scratch,

32:52.266 --> 32:54.500
but then I feel like I'm being selfish

32:54.535 --> 32:56.069
for even thinking that way.

32:56.103 --> 32:57.670
I like Joss.

32:57.704 --> 32:59.272
I really do.

32:59.306 --> 33:02.575
But this isn't about her.

33:02.609 --> 33:03.949
Ever since we were little kids,

33:04.046 --> 33:05.912
running your own restaurant's
always been your dream.

33:05.946 --> 33:07.485
Yeah, but I can
do that without Jonathan.

33:07.505 --> 33:09.682
Let's be real. There aren't that
many gajillionaires out there

33:09.716 --> 33:12.051
who will write you a blank check
and let you do whatever you want.

33:12.086 --> 33:15.154
Yeah, I know, but Joss is
going through a lot right now.

33:16.123 --> 33:19.459
Well, just because someone you're
with asks you to do something,

33:19.493 --> 33:21.810
it doesn't mean you have to do it.

33:22.197 --> 33:24.530
No, I don't have to do anything,

33:24.565 --> 33:26.532
but it'd be nice
to have her support here.

33:26.567 --> 33:28.568
Eventually, she'll be fine.

33:28.602 --> 33:32.438
You have to decide
what is right for you.

33:32.473 --> 33:35.908
You don't need permission
to go after what you want.

33:35.943 --> 33:39.712
In love or business or life.

33:42.349 --> 33:43.950
It's your call.

33:48.255 --> 33:51.224
Good talk. Okay.

33:56.663 --> 33:59.465
[Lucy crying]

34:01.135 --> 34:03.000
Lucy?

34:03.704 --> 34:05.314
What happened?

34:13.147 --> 34:15.681
- Who's that?
- Noel and Tania Stevens.

34:15.716 --> 34:17.516
So, what's wrong?

34:17.551 --> 34:19.619
I've seen them together before.

34:19.652 --> 34:22.487
But he never told me they
hung out outside of school.

34:22.523 --> 34:24.090
He's obviously into her,

34:24.123 --> 34:26.025
or else he would have
said something to me.

34:26.059 --> 34:28.327
And you're basing this
off of one picture?

34:28.362 --> 34:30.696
Well, since he lied about this,

34:30.731 --> 34:33.599
who knows what else he's lying about?

34:33.634 --> 34:35.333
[Sighs] You were right.

34:35.369 --> 34:36.636
I was?

34:36.670 --> 34:38.004
About what?

34:38.038 --> 34:39.505
About what you said about boys.

34:39.540 --> 34:42.014
That they lie
and I shouldn't trust them.

34:42.226 --> 34:44.110
Oh, sweetie, that's not what I said.

34:44.143 --> 34:46.145
Or not what I meant.

34:46.179 --> 34:48.214
I just want you to be careful.

34:48.248 --> 34:52.717
I did not mean to put all these
fears inside of your head.

34:52.753 --> 34:56.656
That's my baggage, and it has
nothing to do with you, really.

34:56.690 --> 34:58.824
But what if boys do lie to me?

34:59.889 --> 35:02.995
Relationships have
a lot of ups and downs.

35:03.030 --> 35:06.299
And at some point, you may get hurt.

35:06.969 --> 35:09.135
But I hope that you'll go
into every relationship

35:09.169 --> 35:11.237
expecting the best.

35:11.271 --> 35:14.574
- Is that what you did with Marc?
- Yes.

35:14.608 --> 35:18.978
Even after dating lots of
not-so-trustworthy people,

35:19.524 --> 35:21.514
I still trust Marc.

35:23.083 --> 35:25.484
- Good. I like Marc.
- I do, too.

35:50.619 --> 35:52.429
- It's about my ex.
- Mm.

35:52.449 --> 35:56.686
Had this crazy tumultuous
relationship years ago.

35:56.720 --> 35:58.888
And I kind of broke his heart.

35:58.923 --> 36:00.423
Do I know this guy?

36:00.457 --> 36:01.624
Maybe.

36:01.659 --> 36:03.226
Yeah.

36:03.260 --> 36:05.862
We had an amazing musical connection,

36:05.896 --> 36:10.700
and the sex was... well, you know.

has moved on.

36:18.509 --> 36:20.610

36:20.644 --> 36:23.780
And I'm happy for you. Really.

36:24.703 --> 36:27.283
I just guess...

36:27.318 --> 36:29.619
What?

36:29.653 --> 36:31.654
I guess there's some part of me

36:31.689 --> 36:33.289
that always thought when I finally

36:33.324 --> 36:37.393
got my stuff together
and you got yours together,

36:37.428 --> 36:40.045
someday, we'd end up as two old people

36:40.151 --> 36:41.898
singing folk songs on our front porch.

36:41.932 --> 36:46.169
Yeah, I know. I used to think
the same thing back then.

Fine.

Good. Then bad. Then good again.

37:14.563 --> 37:16.330
So, better than our sex talk?

[Sighs] Let's forget about our sex talk.

37:19.568 --> 37:21.542
That was so stupid, okay?

37:24.105 --> 37:26.774
- What was that for?
- For being in my life.

37:26.808 --> 37:28.375
After everything I've been through,

37:28.410 --> 37:31.345
I am so lucky
I found someone I can trust.

Okay, I have to get back
to the store, but remember,

37:35.784 --> 37:37.518
we're going out for dinner tonight.

- Mm-hmm.

the four of us should be

38:10.752 --> 38:14.255
throwing down shots anytime
soon, but they understand.

38:15.408 --> 38:16.490
Wow, I, um...
