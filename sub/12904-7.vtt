00:00.845 --> 00:03.050
Now you're gonna see me
fight for my child.

00:03.070 --> 00:05.121
You just messed with the wrong mother.

00:05.141 --> 00:06.693
<i>Previously on "Mistresses"...</i>

00:06.713 --> 00:09.028
- I'm Joss' ex.
- Ex?

00:09.226 --> 00:11.895
It's messy. This has
to be goodbye, right?

00:11.929 --> 00:14.964
Me and Sofia, we used to date.
There's nothing there anymore.

00:14.999 --> 00:16.566
It's purely professional.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.034
Lucy: Hey, Noel.

00:18.068 --> 00:19.903
I thought you weren't allowed
to hang around boys.

00:19.937 --> 00:21.008
I'm not.

00:21.028 --> 00:22.572
I'm not sure I'm so
good with this class.

00:22.606 --> 00:24.482
I'll go back to yoga and
Pilates just for you.

00:24.502 --> 00:25.508
Good.

00:25.543 --> 00:27.811
Don't leave me with him!

00:27.845 --> 00:29.913
[Gasps] [Grunting]

00:29.947 --> 00:31.681
[Screams]

00:31.715 --> 00:33.683
I suppose we should just
keep gambling, then, huh?

00:33.717 --> 00:36.186
- Sure.
- Come on.

00:36.220 --> 00:39.489
Let's go, baby. Give me something.

00:42.625 --> 00:45.428
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

00:45.462 --> 00:49.732
I'm sure you understand
how serious this is.

00:50.318 --> 00:53.380
Um... what do you mean?
How serious what is?

00:55.034 --> 00:56.335
You're kidding, right?

00:56.369 --> 00:58.771
You're saying you know
nothing about the incident

00:58.805 --> 01:00.840
in the hotel hallway in Vegas

01:00.874 --> 01:03.342
between Joss and my nephew, Reza?

01:03.376 --> 01:04.709
I'm sorry, Jonathan.

01:04.744 --> 01:06.236
I-I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:06.256 --> 01:08.207
There seems to have been an altercation.

01:08.227 --> 01:09.962
Reza was arguing with his girlfriend,

01:09.996 --> 01:14.962
and Joss misunderstood
what was going on, and...

01:14.982 --> 01:16.034
And?

01:16.069 --> 01:20.038
And in a misguided attempt
to protect the woman,

01:20.073 --> 01:22.104
Joss attacked Reza.

01:22.509 --> 01:23.882
Attacked?

01:24.278 --> 01:26.311
[Laughs] What do you mean "attacked"?

01:26.346 --> 01:27.980
She sent him to the hospital.

01:28.014 --> 01:30.870
He did his best to calm her
down and not to engage,

01:30.890 --> 01:33.318
but apparently, she was out of control.

01:33.353 --> 01:36.254
Okay. Wait a second.
Sorry. Um... [Chuckles]

01:36.289 --> 01:38.323
You're saying that
my fiancÃ©e and... and Reza

01:38.358 --> 01:40.859
got into a, what, like a fistfight?

01:42.528 --> 01:45.230
[Laughing] Oh, come on.
Jonathan, that is ridiculous.

01:45.264 --> 01:46.698
Yes, it is.

01:46.733 --> 01:48.500
And now I'm trying to figure out

01:48.534 --> 01:52.037
why one of my employees
left my favorite nephew

01:52.071 --> 01:54.539
bloody and bruised
with an injured elbow.

01:54.574 --> 01:57.009
Okay, there is no way
Joss would do that.

01:57.043 --> 01:58.710
I-It has to be a mistake.

01:58.745 --> 02:00.112
It isn't.

02:00.146 --> 02:02.180
And I don't appreciate the insinuation.

02:02.215 --> 02:04.683
So I suggest you speak to your fiancÃ©e

02:04.717 --> 02:06.685
before something else happens.

02:06.719 --> 02:10.088
- Are you threatening Joss?
- I'm not threatening anyone.

02:10.850 --> 02:13.759
I'm just saying that
this needs to get settled,

02:13.793 --> 02:16.261
one way or the other.

[Humming]

02:26.239 --> 02:28.473
Are you humming
the "Hamilton" soundtrack again?

02:28.508 --> 02:30.942
No, actually, I'm working
on my own thing.

02:30.977 --> 02:32.744
Sounds like "Hamilton" to me.

02:37.116 --> 02:38.417
Is that a...

02:38.451 --> 02:39.751
Condom.

02:39.786 --> 02:41.620
Seems like it.

02:44.397 --> 02:45.723
What? It's not mine.

02:45.743 --> 02:47.659
It fell out of Lucy's jacket!

02:47.693 --> 02:49.161
- Uh-oh.
- "Uh-oh"?

02:49.195 --> 02:51.163
That's all you have to say is "uh-oh"?

02:51.197 --> 02:53.565
There is gonna be a whole lot
more than "uh-oh" going on

02:53.599 --> 02:54.833
when I get my hands on her.

02:54.867 --> 02:57.102
- Whoa. Where you going?
- Pulling her out of school,

02:57.136 --> 02:59.738
and then I'm gonna beat
the crap out of that Noel kid.

02:59.772 --> 03:01.473
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

03:01.507 --> 03:03.809
You're not going anywhere in this state.

03:03.843 --> 03:05.510
What do you mean?
The kid from her debate class?

03:05.545 --> 03:08.080
- That Noel?
- Yep. This just reeks of Noel.

03:08.114 --> 03:09.672
How do you even know
what Noel smells like?

03:09.692 --> 03:11.834
- Th-This is no time to joke!
- Okay, look. Here's an idea.

03:11.854 --> 03:13.318
How about we have him over for dinner?

03:13.352 --> 03:15.120
And that way, you know
what you're dealing with.

03:15.154 --> 03:16.718
You think he's just gonna
tell us if they're having sex?

03:16.738 --> 03:18.257
Give me 20 minutes
in the room with them,

03:18.277 --> 03:19.621
and I will be able to tell.

03:19.641 --> 03:22.128
I have a kind of radar
for this sort of thing.

03:23.445 --> 03:24.482
Fine.

03:24.516 --> 03:26.584
Okay. 20 minutes.

03:26.618 --> 03:30.221
That's all you get.
And after that, he is all mine.

03:30.255 --> 03:31.556
[Scoffs]

03:32.591 --> 03:34.425
Vivian's finally asleep.

03:34.459 --> 03:37.559
Our pediatrician just thinks
she has a little cold.

03:38.445 --> 03:40.264
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

03:40.299 --> 03:42.166
Of course. I'm just
glad you reached out.

03:42.201 --> 03:45.069
I wasn't sure
you'd be up for it after...

03:45.103 --> 03:46.915
[Chuckles] Oh, come on.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.578
Just because Savi's run off to Bali

03:48.598 --> 03:50.208
doesn't mean I'm gonna
leave you all alone

03:50.242 --> 03:52.726
to fight your deadbeat
baby daddy in court.

03:52.746 --> 03:56.126
And you really think we have
a shot at sole physical custody?

03:56.146 --> 03:58.223
I mean, most family courts
start out favoring the mother,

03:58.243 --> 04:00.578
and considering Alec
didn't even see Vivian

04:00.612 --> 04:03.280
for the first four months,
well, let's just say

04:03.315 --> 04:05.549
it's not exactly an advertisement
for good parenting.

04:05.584 --> 04:06.929
Does he even have a case?

04:06.949 --> 04:09.003
There's always a case to be made.

04:09.023 --> 04:10.725
But they probably know
they're not gonna get

04:10.745 --> 04:11.978
everything they ask for.

04:12.013 --> 04:13.647
All the decision-making power

04:13.681 --> 04:16.916
and restricting me to supervised
visits? I would hope so.

04:16.951 --> 04:18.791
My guess is that they're
asking for a lot upfront

04:18.812 --> 04:21.254
so they can look like they're
making big concessions later on.

04:21.289 --> 04:23.323
So you think we can resolve everything

04:23.357 --> 04:26.107
at the meeting today
without going to court?

04:26.794 --> 04:28.094
Hopefully.

04:28.129 --> 04:30.030
But I just want you to be prepared

04:30.064 --> 04:31.698
that this could get ugly.

04:31.732 --> 04:34.568
Now, is there anything
that Alec might use against you

04:34.602 --> 04:36.303
that I should know about?

04:36.663 --> 04:38.738
So, I guess you didn't read my book.

04:38.773 --> 04:40.740
Mm, no.

04:40.775 --> 04:42.876
[Sighs] Well, it's a little blunt

04:42.910 --> 04:45.378
about some of the mistakes I've made.

04:45.413 --> 04:48.582
But everything in it happened
long before I had Vivian.

04:48.616 --> 04:51.816
Yeah, well, they're gonna
use it as much as possible.

04:52.056 --> 04:54.054
- [Sighs]
- Look.

04:54.088 --> 04:58.425
This may be a long, nasty fight, Karen.

04:58.459 --> 05:01.528
You're willing to stick it out?

05:01.562 --> 05:04.664
To the bitter end. Whatever it takes.

05:08.060 --> 05:10.136
Ugh.

05:10.156 --> 05:12.906
Brian and his new girlfriend are
running a marathon together.

05:12.940 --> 05:15.308
Wow. That is a lot of neon.

05:15.343 --> 05:17.477
You dodged a bullet, honey.
A big, bright bullet.

05:17.511 --> 05:18.612
I know.

05:18.646 --> 05:21.846
It's just been so hard
to get Brian out of my system.

05:23.773 --> 05:25.886
You did this once...
Broke off an engagement.

05:25.920 --> 05:29.422
What was his name? Uh... Scott?

05:29.457 --> 05:30.657
Yeah.

05:30.691 --> 05:32.792
Definitely not my awesomest moment.

05:32.827 --> 05:37.230
I, uh... I stood him up at
our wedding for your brother.

05:37.265 --> 05:39.232
Last I heard, he was
getting married, though,

05:39.267 --> 05:40.934
so hopefully he's happy now.

05:40.968 --> 05:43.103
So, he's... He's a good guy?

05:43.137 --> 05:45.866
Mm-hmm. Nothing wrong with him at all?

05:46.376 --> 05:47.674
Nope.

05:47.708 --> 05:50.713
Although he did have a bit of
a kink for women's footwear.

05:50.733 --> 05:52.979
My frickin' arches killed me
the whole time we were dating.

05:53.014 --> 05:55.882
Joss. Do you have a second?

05:56.884 --> 05:58.800
I'll be, uh...

05:58.820 --> 06:01.922
Bye. [Clears throat] Good talk.

06:03.190 --> 06:04.691
So I guess you know.

06:04.725 --> 06:07.093
That you got into a fight with
Jonathan's nephew in Las Vegas?

06:07.128 --> 06:08.528
Yeah, he just told me.

06:08.562 --> 06:10.630
- Did you get hurt?
- No, I'm fine. Really.

06:10.665 --> 06:12.432
- When did this happen?
- Just...

06:12.466 --> 06:15.335
Okay. Do you remember
when I went upstairs

06:15.369 --> 06:18.038
to change clothes before we were
gonna leave to get married?

06:18.072 --> 06:19.706
There was this guy down the hall,

06:19.740 --> 06:21.975
and he was trying to get
this woman into his hotel room.

06:22.009 --> 06:24.344
- Like, what, against her will?
- It was crazy.

06:24.378 --> 06:26.313
I mean, he basically
slammed her against the wall,

06:26.347 --> 06:28.495
and then she screamed for help, and
when I went over there to stop him,

06:28.515 --> 06:29.983
that's when I realized that it was Reza.

06:30.017 --> 06:31.851
According to Jonathan,
you did more than just stop him.

06:31.886 --> 06:34.721
Y-You put him in the hospital.

06:34.755 --> 06:37.023
So, why... why didn't you
tell me any of this?

06:37.058 --> 06:39.859
I don't know. Maybe because I
knew that it would, you know,

06:39.894 --> 06:41.394
complicate things with you and Jonathan,

06:41.429 --> 06:43.196
and, honestly, I just wanted
it to go away, Harry.

06:43.230 --> 06:44.798
Well, that certainly hasn't happened

06:44.832 --> 06:46.866
and, you know, it would
have been nice to know

06:46.901 --> 06:48.868
before Jonathan called me
into his office, Joss.

06:48.903 --> 06:50.003
I felt like an idiot.

06:50.037 --> 06:51.465
I'm sorry.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.407
Is that what this is?

06:54.442 --> 06:56.009
From punching Reza?

06:56.043 --> 06:58.712
Not from some accident,
like you told me.

06:58.746 --> 06:59.879
Yeah.

06:59.914 --> 07:02.582
Okay. So... [Scoffs]

07:02.616 --> 07:04.918
You... You didn't trust me
enough to say anything.

07:04.952 --> 07:06.553
No, that's not true, Harry.

07:06.587 --> 07:08.254
It's just... It's not that simple.

07:08.289 --> 07:10.657
Well, it seems simple, Joss.
You just tell me.

07:10.691 --> 07:14.561
What doesn't seem simple is how you
were able to beat up Reza so easily.

07:14.595 --> 07:15.929
[Sighs]

07:15.963 --> 07:17.330
Okay.

07:17.365 --> 07:19.332
Um, I never stopped going
to my Impact class.

07:19.367 --> 07:22.569
So, y-you lied to me
about stopping the class,

07:22.603 --> 07:24.871
you lied to me about the fight,
then you lied to me

07:24.905 --> 07:26.583
about why you didn't want
to get married that night.

07:26.603 --> 07:29.761
Joss, is... is there
anything you haven't
been lying to me about?

07:29.781 --> 07:31.444
- Harry...
- What is going on with you, Joss?

07:31.479 --> 07:32.445
Nothing is going on with me!

07:32.480 --> 07:35.254
I... I saw something,
and I reacted. I'm sorry.

07:35.274 --> 07:37.050
Well, that's great,
but I still have to figure out

07:37.084 --> 07:38.618
what I'm supposed to tell Jonathan,

07:38.652 --> 07:41.260
especially since he thinks
you attacked Reza unprovoked.

07:41.280 --> 07:43.523
Well, maybe try telling him
the truth, Harry.

07:43.557 --> 07:46.292
âª

07:49.296 --> 07:51.364
In addition, Faith is a pediatrician

07:51.399 --> 07:53.800
who plans to become
a full-time caregiver.

07:53.834 --> 07:55.969
That role in Karen's home
has already been filled

07:56.003 --> 07:58.071
by an endless rotation of nannies.

07:58.105 --> 08:00.907
Well, I imagine
a second caretaker was helpful

08:00.941 --> 08:02.706
after Vivian's father abandoned her.

08:02.726 --> 08:05.292
I only stayed away
because Karen asked me to

08:05.312 --> 08:06.946
and I wanted to respect her wishes.

08:06.980 --> 08:08.081
That's a lie.

08:08.115 --> 08:11.739
You chose to miss the first
four months of her life.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.437
You don't know the first
thing about Vivian.

08:13.457 --> 08:14.964
How dare you come here now

08:14.984 --> 08:17.051
and try to take her away from me.

08:18.692 --> 08:21.094
Vivian has just begun the most important

08:21.128 --> 08:23.229
developmental years of her life.

08:23.263 --> 08:24.997
It is vital that she be
in an environment

08:25.032 --> 08:28.404
where she will receive maximum
intellectual stimulation.

08:28.424 --> 08:29.435
What the hell is that?

08:29.470 --> 08:32.972
Look, I think we all want to
reach some kind of compromise

08:33.006 --> 08:35.741
so we can avoid a lengthy court process.

08:35.775 --> 08:37.844
I have no interest in compromising.

08:37.878 --> 08:39.846
You have no proof that Karen has been

08:39.880 --> 08:42.115
anything other than a perfect mother.

08:42.149 --> 08:44.751
Actually, I didn't want
to bring this up,

08:44.785 --> 08:46.686
but I assume you remember calling me

08:46.720 --> 08:48.650
when I was in Costa Rica?

08:48.670 --> 08:49.689
Calling you?

08:49.723 --> 08:51.157
When you were 12 weeks pregnant

08:51.191 --> 08:53.923
on the way to the doctor
to discuss an abortion?

08:55.696 --> 08:58.733
I'm not sure what
that has to do with this.

08:58.753 --> 09:00.133
I still have the voicemails,

09:00.153 --> 09:02.869
and they don't sugarcoat the fact
that you didn't want this baby

09:02.903 --> 09:04.305
and you never did.

09:04.325 --> 09:06.628
Obviously I didn't go through with it.

09:06.648 --> 09:08.174
And it's not like you begged me not to.

09:08.208 --> 09:10.209
I was in no position to ask you

09:10.244 --> 09:12.945
to keep a baby you didn't want.

09:12.980 --> 09:15.782
We're not giving up until we get
full custody of Vivian.

09:15.816 --> 09:18.785
If you want a fight, we're ready.

09:18.819 --> 09:21.287
âª

09:28.666 --> 09:30.141
I need your advice.

09:30.161 --> 09:32.963
But you have to promise that you
won't say anything to anyone.

09:32.997 --> 09:34.965
Okay.

09:34.999 --> 09:36.533
I met someone.

09:36.567 --> 09:37.601
That's great!

09:37.635 --> 09:40.837
Well [Sighs] not so fast.

09:40.872 --> 09:42.039
It's Scott.

09:42.073 --> 09:43.840
Scott Bakula?

09:43.875 --> 09:45.976
Scott Trosman.

09:46.010 --> 09:49.980
As in Dr. Scott Trosman,
Joss' ex-fiancÃ©?

09:50.618 --> 09:52.983
Oh, no, no, no.

09:53.017 --> 09:54.551
When we realized the Joss connection,

09:54.585 --> 09:56.286
- we broke things off.
- Good.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.888
Now I'm thinking that was a mistake.

09:57.922 --> 09:59.523
You're thinking that was a mistake?

09:59.557 --> 10:02.893
If Joss ever finds out... wow.

10:02.927 --> 10:04.528
So you think she would be mad?

10:04.562 --> 10:06.897
Like, how mad on a scale from 1 to 10?

10:06.931 --> 10:08.665
10 isn't high enough.

10:08.699 --> 10:10.500
And that's not even factoring in Harry,

10:10.535 --> 10:11.802
who would be at least a 20.

10:11.836 --> 10:14.471
Seriously, of all the people
in Los Angeles?

10:14.505 --> 10:16.173
You can't choose who you fall for.

10:16.207 --> 10:19.009
Aren't you the one dating your
dead husband's mistress' brother?

10:19.043 --> 10:21.078
We're not talking about me right now.

10:21.112 --> 10:22.679
Is it really worth it?

10:22.713 --> 10:26.216
Pissing off your brother and Joss
for a hot guy you barely even know?

10:26.250 --> 10:27.417
[Bell jingles]

10:27.452 --> 10:29.134
But I do know him.

10:29.154 --> 10:31.644
And it's not just physical.
We have a real connection.

10:31.664 --> 10:34.691
I haven't felt this way
since I first met Brian.

10:34.725 --> 10:36.359
And I know Joss wants him to be happy,

10:36.394 --> 10:38.411
so why not give it a try?

10:38.431 --> 10:39.996
I just think it's a messy situation,

10:40.031 --> 10:41.531
and maybe you should just let it lie.

10:41.566 --> 10:43.567
- Well, I don't agree!
- I thought you wanted my advice.

10:43.601 --> 10:46.134
Not if I don't agree with it.

10:46.416 --> 10:49.106
You know what?
You can do whatever you want.

10:49.140 --> 10:51.875
But please leave me out of it.

10:55.379 --> 10:57.380
How could you do this?

10:57.415 --> 11:00.750
You took my most vulnerable
moment and used it against me.

11:00.785 --> 11:04.020
I'm sorry, but you said you were
unwilling to compromise,

11:04.055 --> 11:05.889
and I have to do
what's best for our daughter.

11:05.923 --> 11:08.725
- Don't you dare hide behind Vivian.
- I'm not.

11:08.759 --> 11:12.796
I genuinely think the best place
for Vivian is with Faith and I.

11:12.830 --> 11:15.432
But her well-being
is the most important thing.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.134
Do you really believe that,

11:17.168 --> 11:19.436
or is this just
your way of punishing me?

11:19.470 --> 11:20.705
- Punishing you for what?
- I think

11:20.725 --> 11:22.572
you blame me for Vivian's death.

11:22.607 --> 11:25.308
I think you're bitter
that you had to share

11:25.343 --> 11:27.711
the last year of her life with me,

11:27.745 --> 11:31.114
and I think that resentment
is clouding your judgment.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.950
I care about you, and I always will.

11:33.985 --> 11:36.786
- Please.
- I'm here to let you off the hook.

11:36.821 --> 11:39.956
Just sign the papers and you don't
have to deal with any of this.

11:39.991 --> 11:42.692
You know it's best for all of us.

11:44.028 --> 11:46.561
I guess I'll see you in court. [Sighs]

11:46.940 --> 11:48.431
[Sighs]

11:49.403 --> 11:50.881
Are you okay? You didn't get hurt?

11:50.901 --> 11:52.269
I promise I'm fine.

11:52.303 --> 11:55.505
It's... It's actually Harry
that has the problem.

11:55.540 --> 11:56.773
Why? What's wrong with Harry?

11:56.807 --> 11:59.664
Ugh. He's pissed that I didn't
tell him about what happened.

11:59.684 --> 12:01.433
And I lied to him about a few things.

12:01.453 --> 12:03.483
You didn't think he would understand?

12:03.503 --> 12:06.238
No, I just, you know, I knew
it would turn into a big deal.

12:06.272 --> 12:08.807
It was Jonathan's nephew,
so it would affect his business,

12:08.842 --> 12:10.642
and then he'd want to know
how I beat the guy up,

12:10.677 --> 12:12.778
and I'd have to explain
that I never quit Impact,

12:12.812 --> 12:14.479
even though I told him that I did.

12:15.682 --> 12:18.483
So, you've basically
been lying to my brother

12:18.518 --> 12:19.785
about everything.

12:19.819 --> 12:22.087
W... Uh, not everything.

12:22.121 --> 12:24.256
Sometimes people feel like
they have to lie

12:24.290 --> 12:26.291
because the truth
is too hard to explain.

12:26.997 --> 12:28.059
Exactly.

12:28.079 --> 12:30.963
Okay, can we just please change
the subject now? Anything else.

12:30.997 --> 12:33.265
I should go help that customer.

12:33.299 --> 12:35.801
No, Kate, don't go.

12:37.237 --> 12:39.438
Hm. Well, thanks for
defending me, at least.

12:39.458 --> 12:40.825
I wasn't.

12:40.859 --> 12:42.635
Harry has a right to be hurt.

12:42.655 --> 12:44.495
You're about to spend the rest
of your life with him.

12:44.530 --> 12:47.064
If you can't trust him,
isn't that a problem?

12:47.099 --> 12:48.966
Think about it...
If Harry had been the one lying,

12:49.001 --> 12:51.786
how would you feel?

12:51.806 --> 12:53.471
Right.

12:53.505 --> 12:55.006
Can you just do me a favor?

12:55.040 --> 12:56.669
Maybe stop making so much sense?

12:56.689 --> 12:58.332
I can't help it. I'm so wise.

12:58.352 --> 13:00.645
[Both laugh]

13:00.679 --> 13:01.812
[Door opens]

13:01.847 --> 13:05.316
- Hi!
- Hey.

13:05.350 --> 13:06.850
How's Vivian doing?

13:06.870 --> 13:09.086
She's doing a little better.
She's still coughing a lot.

13:09.121 --> 13:10.822
But I finally got her to go to sleep.

13:10.842 --> 13:12.359
[Sighing] Okay.

13:12.379 --> 13:14.024
Um, there is one other thing.

13:14.044 --> 13:16.494
An investigator from the
law firm stopped by earlier.

13:16.528 --> 13:18.863
He was asking a lot of
questions. He left that.

13:18.897 --> 13:20.867
This is Alec's lawyer's firm.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.033
What did this guy want?

13:22.067 --> 13:24.101
He was asking how often you see Vivian,

13:24.136 --> 13:25.169
how many hours I work... [Sighs]

13:25.204 --> 13:28.005
He asked about her health.
He heard her coughing.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.523
You didn't say anything, right?

13:29.543 --> 13:32.004
No. Not a word. I promise.

13:32.024 --> 13:34.045
Thank you. I'm gonna call Dom.

13:34.079 --> 13:37.715
You're not gonna lose Vivian, are you?

13:37.749 --> 13:39.684
There's no way that's happening.

13:39.718 --> 13:41.719
Dom's investigator is looking into Alec.

13:41.753 --> 13:44.021
We'll find something on him.

13:49.394 --> 13:51.362
Hey, I'm going to Noel's
to study, if that's okay.

13:51.396 --> 13:52.430
Mm.

13:52.464 --> 13:56.067
Actually, I think you should
invite Noel over here.

13:56.101 --> 13:58.402
We can have dinner together
before you study.

13:58.437 --> 14:00.095
[Scoffs] Why would I do that?

14:00.115 --> 14:01.482
What has Noel ever done to you?

14:01.516 --> 14:03.317
Well, you've been spending
a lot of time with him,

14:03.351 --> 14:05.719
so we'd like to meet the young man.

14:05.754 --> 14:07.588
You know, to get to
know your friends better.

14:07.622 --> 14:10.205
Well, you don't have to.
Really, it's fine.

14:10.225 --> 14:12.532
[Scoffs] This isn't really a suggestion.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.253
If you want to hang out
with Noel anymore,

14:14.287 --> 14:15.654
he's coming to dinner.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.156
You can study here just as easily.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.692
- That's so unfair.
- I promise we'll be cool.

14:23.796 --> 14:25.564
All right. I'll text him.

14:25.598 --> 14:28.000
But he's gluten-free
and he has a peanut allergy,

14:28.034 --> 14:29.668
so that pasta's not gonna cut it.

14:31.045 --> 14:33.338
Just be sure to
check his bag at the door.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.375
April, I told you.
20 minutes. It's all I need.

14:37.169 --> 14:39.161
So, I talked to Joss

14:39.195 --> 14:42.865
and, uh, I think your nephew
left a few things out.

14:42.899 --> 14:44.800
Seems it was Reza
who instigated the fight.

14:44.834 --> 14:48.303
She says he slammed
his girlfriend into a door.

14:49.472 --> 14:50.672
You don't believe me.

14:50.707 --> 14:51.640
I do believe you.

14:51.674 --> 14:54.109
And I understand why
you would believe her.

14:54.143 --> 14:57.946
But my nephew, he's family.

14:57.981 --> 15:01.516
Sure. But if he was assaulting
a woman in the hotel hallway...

15:01.551 --> 15:03.685
Listen. I think it would
be best if Joss tried

15:03.720 --> 15:05.757
to smooth things over with Reza.

15:05.924 --> 15:07.789
Yeah, I'm not sure that's a great idea.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.591
That's your call,
but I'm concerned about

15:09.626 --> 15:11.493
the effect this could have
on our business.

15:11.527 --> 15:12.861
I don't think it's come to that.

15:12.896 --> 15:14.196
Neither do I.

15:14.230 --> 15:16.365
I just don't need the negative press

15:16.399 --> 15:20.129
if my family was involved in
a criminal case against yours.

15:20.149 --> 15:23.171
- A criminal case?
- Reza wants to press charges.

15:23.206 --> 15:26.441
And without an apology
from your fiancÃ©e,

15:26.476 --> 15:28.210
I'm not sure if I can stop him.

15:28.244 --> 15:31.813
âª

15:34.172 --> 15:35.307
This is amazing!

15:35.342 --> 15:37.976
Which means that values
are something we've invented,

15:37.996 --> 15:39.830
and having them should be
a choice rather than

15:39.864 --> 15:41.911
something that's forced on us.

15:42.701 --> 15:44.635
And you got all this
from a book on architecture?

15:44.669 --> 15:47.604
"The Fountainhead" is about
so much more than architecture.

15:47.639 --> 15:49.340
Wow. I'll have to read it sometime.

15:49.374 --> 15:51.575
No, you guys wouldn't like it.

15:51.609 --> 15:53.344
Is it like "The Da Vinci Code?"

15:53.378 --> 15:55.779
'Cause I liked "The Da Vinci Code"...
Short chapters.

15:57.782 --> 15:59.850
So... [Clears throat]

15:59.884 --> 16:02.340
Do you read a lot of adult books, Noel?

16:02.788 --> 16:05.756
Would you consider
yourself to be mature?

16:07.659 --> 16:09.259
In... In some ways.

16:09.294 --> 16:11.762
But my prefrontal cortex
won't finish growing

16:11.796 --> 16:13.163
till another 5 to 10 years,

16:13.198 --> 16:16.433
and that's the major
physical sign of maturity.

16:18.403 --> 16:20.604
Right. I'm not really sure
what any of that all means.

16:20.638 --> 16:25.187
I guess what I'm wondering is...
Do you have any older brothers?

16:26.023 --> 16:27.177
Uh...

16:27.212 --> 16:29.580
Um, can we go to my room and study now?

16:30.582 --> 16:33.117
Um, okay, but clear your plates first,

16:33.151 --> 16:35.822
and just know we're going
to come in and check on you.

16:35.842 --> 16:37.221
And your door stays open.

16:37.255 --> 16:39.323
Not cracked open.

16:39.357 --> 16:41.024
Wide open.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.161
Mm.

16:45.864 --> 16:48.165
Thanks for the great dinner, Ms. Malloy.

16:55.507 --> 16:57.141
[Sighs]

16:57.175 --> 16:58.776
Well?

17:00.516 --> 17:01.745
I got nothing.

17:01.780 --> 17:03.220
[Sighs]

17:08.420 --> 17:10.220
Hey.

17:11.723 --> 17:14.558
So, look, before you
go getting all angry at me,

17:14.592 --> 17:17.661
which I now realize you may
have every right to do,

17:17.694 --> 17:21.258
I just... I want to say
that I'm... I'm really sorry

17:21.278 --> 17:23.400
that, you know, I lied.

17:23.435 --> 17:25.868
It's been a really tough year
with the trial and everything,

17:25.904 --> 17:29.285
and I know that's no excuse,
but it's... it's the truth.

17:29.989 --> 17:31.463
Right. Um...

17:31.483 --> 17:32.776
- Yeah.
- Okay?

17:32.811 --> 17:33.877
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.

17:33.912 --> 17:36.413
I know, and, uh, I appreciate
what you're saying.

17:37.582 --> 17:39.950
- But we have a bigger problem.
- What do you mean?

17:39.984 --> 17:41.552
Reza wants to have you charged.

17:41.586 --> 17:44.054
Wait, wait. Hold on.
H-He's accusing me of assault?

17:44.088 --> 17:45.789
Well, that's fine.
I'll do the same to him.

17:45.824 --> 17:47.524
I would love to put
that thug behind bars.

17:47.559 --> 17:50.099
Joss, stop. Think about this.
If he thinks he can press charges,

17:50.119 --> 17:51.723
that means the girl you were protecting

17:51.743 --> 17:53.430
is willing to support Reza's story.

17:53.465 --> 17:54.883
Did you even defend me to Jonathan?

17:54.903 --> 17:57.061
Of course I did! I told him
everything you told me.

17:57.081 --> 17:58.235
And so, what? He doesn't care?

17:58.269 --> 17:59.770
And so it didn't... Nothing matters?

17:59.804 --> 18:01.271
You just go along with
whatever he wants to do?

18:01.306 --> 18:03.574
It's not about Jonathan.
In fact, he's trying to help.

18:03.608 --> 18:06.543
Look, he's convinced Reza
to not do anything...

18:08.080 --> 18:09.277
if you apologize.

18:09.297 --> 18:11.547
- Apologize?
- Yeah.

18:11.819 --> 18:13.317
[Scoffs]

18:13.351 --> 18:15.118
No, Harry. I'm not going
in there to apologize.

18:15.153 --> 18:16.353
I've done nothing wrong.

18:16.387 --> 18:18.489
Well, unless you want to take
a chance of going back to jail,

18:18.523 --> 18:20.424
you don't have
a lot of other options, Joss.

18:20.458 --> 18:23.393
How about the option
of my fiancÃ© supporting me

18:23.428 --> 18:26.230
and making Jonathan understand
that this is a bunch of crap?

18:26.264 --> 18:28.232
- Yep. Yep. I tried that.
- You know, fine.

18:28.266 --> 18:30.400
Let Reza do whatever he wants to do.

18:30.435 --> 18:33.192
You're being reckless with
your future, with our future.

18:33.212 --> 18:34.905
Just think about it, okay?

18:36.341 --> 18:38.442
Yeah, I just...
I have so much work to do.

18:38.476 --> 18:40.310
I can't even believe you.

18:42.347 --> 18:44.181
I can't tell for sure,
but I'd say there's

18:44.215 --> 18:47.317
probably a 95% chance
absolutely nothing is going on.

18:47.352 --> 18:49.419
What about the other 5%, Mr. Radar?

18:49.454 --> 18:51.522
It was kind of on the fritz tonight.

18:51.556 --> 18:53.323
And you never know. They are 14.

18:53.358 --> 18:54.791
What does that mean?

18:56.332 --> 18:59.115
Hold on. You had sex when you were 14?

18:59.135 --> 19:01.492
Huh, wait, what? When did you?

19:02.171 --> 19:04.772
- 18, with Paul.
- Paul?

19:04.807 --> 19:06.141
Paul was your first?

19:06.175 --> 19:08.076
I know everyone that you've slept with?

19:08.110 --> 19:10.879
- Four people?
- Five. You forgot about yourself.

19:10.913 --> 19:13.768
- [Sighs]
- Which you can do tonight, by the way.

19:14.617 --> 19:16.718
So, how many have you had sex with?

19:18.320 --> 19:20.054
Hey, I was young, sometimes drunk,

19:20.089 --> 19:22.193
and these things just kind of add up.

19:22.791 --> 19:24.275
Look, other than you and Sofia,

19:24.295 --> 19:26.060
I didn't have a lot
of longterm relationships.

19:26.095 --> 19:28.263
I really don't need to hear
about Sofia right now.

19:28.297 --> 19:29.531
Hey, I'm a dude, okay?

19:29.565 --> 19:32.000
We are wired to want to have sex
with as many women as possible.

19:32.034 --> 19:33.654
It's not me. It's science.

19:34.103 --> 19:37.172
But when someone
really special comes along,

19:37.206 --> 19:38.606
I'm glad to stop.

19:38.641 --> 19:40.308
I'm so sorry to be holding you back.

19:40.342 --> 19:42.702
No, what I'm saying is I'm glad
that you're holding me back.

19:43.212 --> 19:44.439
That sounded wrong.

19:44.459 --> 19:47.115
[Sighs] I'm pretty sure
I get the picture.

19:47.149 --> 19:48.550
[Groans]

19:49.648 --> 19:50.785
[Knock on door]

19:50.819 --> 19:52.453
Okay, Ms. Crawford,
I see you're interested

19:52.488 --> 19:55.957
in some potential rhinoplasty.

19:55.991 --> 19:58.126
âª

19:58.160 --> 20:02.997
âª You ain't talking, but I feel it âª

20:03.032 --> 20:04.296
Kate, what are you doing here?

20:04.316 --> 20:07.194
I heard you were the best
plastic surgeon in town.

20:07.214 --> 20:12.307
Uh, well, you heard right,
but this, uh... is a bad idea.

20:12.341 --> 20:15.681
So, what do you think about my nose?

20:15.701 --> 20:18.513
âª For what I need in the dark âª

20:18.547 --> 20:21.182
Uh, well, in my professional opinion,
I would say your nose is perfect.

20:21.217 --> 20:22.483
âª Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh âª

20:22.518 --> 20:24.052
And the rest of me?

20:24.086 --> 20:27.388
Anything I should... change?

20:27.423 --> 20:29.857
Oh, uh, please, n-no.

20:29.892 --> 20:33.027
No, I-I, you know, I mean,
I wouldn't change a damn thing.

20:33.062 --> 20:34.629
It's great except the fact that you keep

20:34.663 --> 20:37.165
coming by my office unannounced.

20:37.199 --> 20:40.401
I left you messages,
but you didn't call me back.

20:40.436 --> 20:41.828
âª Bring it to me, bring it to me now âª

20:41.848 --> 20:44.739
So I decided to make
an appointment instead.

20:44.773 --> 20:47.308
I recognize all the levels of crazy

20:47.343 --> 20:51.335
that showing up like this is.

20:52.248 --> 20:54.037
But...

20:54.717 --> 20:56.017
I missed you.

20:56.051 --> 20:57.485
âª Oh, I know you won't keep me waiting âª

20:57.519 --> 21:00.611
So, you missed me... too?

21:00.631 --> 21:02.023
âª For what is mine âª

21:02.057 --> 21:03.191
Maybe a little.

21:03.225 --> 21:05.093
âª What is mine âª

21:05.127 --> 21:07.161
âª Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh âª

21:07.196 --> 21:09.945
- Mm.
- Mm. Sorry.

21:09.965 --> 21:11.898
No, it's nothing to apologize for.

21:11.918 --> 21:13.034
âª Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh âª

21:13.068 --> 21:15.603
âª Bring it to me, bring it to me now âª

21:15.638 --> 21:17.405
I mean, come on.

21:17.439 --> 21:19.207
âª Ooh, ooh, ooh âª

21:20.442 --> 21:22.299
âª Bring it to me now

21:22.642 --> 21:24.212
I'm sorry I don't have better news,

21:24.246 --> 21:26.247
but our investigator
didn't find anything out

21:26.282 --> 21:27.949
about Alec that we didn't already know.

21:27.983 --> 21:29.384
Nothing?

21:30.819 --> 21:32.216
What about Faith?

21:32.236 --> 21:34.255
Alec married some
random woman he barely knew.

21:34.290 --> 21:36.057
There has to be something on her.

21:36.091 --> 21:37.592
She's religious, a pediatrician,

21:37.626 --> 21:39.394
and she's becoming a stay-at-home mom.

21:39.428 --> 21:42.563
No, she does not help our case.

21:42.598 --> 21:45.033
What if Alec asked me run away with him

21:45.067 --> 21:48.102
before I got pregnant while
his wife was dying of cancer?

21:48.137 --> 21:49.804
Would that help our case?

21:49.838 --> 21:51.306
I'm not sure.

21:51.340 --> 21:52.573
He did that?

21:52.608 --> 21:54.409
No, but he could have.

21:54.443 --> 21:56.144
It's my word against his.

21:56.178 --> 21:57.378
- Karen.
- What about an alcoholic?

21:57.413 --> 21:59.280
Could we say he's an alcoholic?

21:59.315 --> 22:01.382
Karen, I understand your concern,
but you're spinning here.

22:01.417 --> 22:04.152
We can't say anything
unless we can prove it.

22:04.186 --> 22:07.131
He's trying to take Vivian.
I can't let him do that!

22:07.151 --> 22:09.123
- [Vivian cries]
- Just... Just try to relax.

22:09.158 --> 22:10.358
I can't relax!

22:10.392 --> 22:13.961
You need to figure something out
or find me a lawyer who can.

22:13.996 --> 22:16.224
I'm not losing my daughter!

22:19.244 --> 22:23.025
So, you want to go out later,
get something to eat?

22:23.045 --> 22:25.514
I miss talking to you.

22:25.548 --> 22:30.177
Yeah, um, look, I mean,
that was fun, obviously.

22:30.197 --> 22:32.287
Um, I don't know if it
changes anything, though.

22:32.321 --> 22:35.533
I mean, whatever this is,
whatever we are, it's still

22:35.553 --> 22:36.992
too complicated, isn't it?

22:37.026 --> 22:39.027
Doesn't have to be.

22:39.061 --> 22:40.428
No one even has to know.

22:40.463 --> 22:42.931
It can be our little secret.

22:42.965 --> 22:46.668
Think of it like
doctorpatient confidentiality.

22:46.702 --> 22:48.537
So, you're not even a little curious

22:48.571 --> 22:50.138
to see if this could work out.

22:50.172 --> 22:51.940
Not just a fling.

22:51.974 --> 22:54.376
Even if I was, it would
still be a secret fling, right?

22:54.410 --> 22:56.044
I mean, if... if we really
wanted to give this a shot,

22:56.078 --> 22:57.846
we'd have to tell Joss,
we'd have to tell Harry.

22:57.880 --> 22:59.548
That's not happening. I'll tell them.

22:59.582 --> 23:00.982
- Y-You're gonna tell them?
- Yeah.

23:01.017 --> 23:02.617
Okay. Yeah, no, even though
your brother's reaction

23:02.652 --> 23:03.852
is gonna be to hit me,
which, by the way,

23:03.886 --> 23:06.187
- I don't think I would blame him.
- He won't hit you.

23:06.222 --> 23:08.023
They won't even think it's a big deal.

23:08.057 --> 23:09.991
I promise.

23:10.026 --> 23:12.644
I guess if you could actually
get Harry and Joss' blessing...

23:12.664 --> 23:14.963
- Which I will...
- Then hell, yeah.

23:14.997 --> 23:16.565
Yes. I want to see
where this goes, yeah.

23:16.599 --> 23:18.033
[Squeals]

23:18.067 --> 23:19.534
Mm. Mm.

23:19.569 --> 23:22.671
Well, two blessings coming up.

23:22.705 --> 23:24.839
- Yeah? All right.
- Yeah. I'll see you later.

23:24.874 --> 23:26.341
[Laughs] [Door closes]

23:26.375 --> 23:28.076
âª Somebody save your soul âª

23:28.110 --> 23:29.344
âª 'Cause you've been sinning
in this city I know âª

23:29.378 --> 23:31.079
Oh!

23:32.012 --> 23:34.583
Does this mean Joss can kick my ass?

23:34.617 --> 23:36.785
- I guess I should be nicer to her.
- This is not funny.

23:36.819 --> 23:38.420
How can I convince her
to make things right

23:38.454 --> 23:40.088
with Jonathan's family
if she doesn't think

23:40.122 --> 23:42.090
she has anything to apologize for?

23:43.303 --> 23:44.359
Maybe you can't.

23:44.393 --> 23:45.681
That's very helpful. Thanks.

23:45.701 --> 23:48.430
I'm making a point here.
It's got to come from her.

23:48.464 --> 23:49.581
And Joss is smart.

23:49.601 --> 23:51.435
She'll make the right decision
if you give her space.

23:51.470 --> 23:54.004
âª You've been sinning
in the city I know âª

23:54.039 --> 23:55.680
For three points.

23:55.700 --> 23:57.875
âª All these lovers
got you losing control âª

23:57.909 --> 24:00.411
I mean, she's convinced
she's not gonna get arrested.

24:00.445 --> 24:01.679
And that whole Calista nightmare...

24:01.713 --> 24:04.615
The murder, the trial... It changed her.

24:04.649 --> 24:07.551
Yeah, but she still
loves you. Don't forget.

24:07.586 --> 24:10.421
âª I can make your hands clap âª

24:10.455 --> 24:12.089
âª Said I can make your hands clap âª

24:12.124 --> 24:13.591
[Grunts]

24:13.625 --> 24:14.959
âª And when we wake,
we'd be the only sound âª

24:14.993 --> 24:16.460
Hey, random question.

24:16.495 --> 24:20.364
How many, uh, people
have you slept with?

24:20.398 --> 24:23.467
I don't usually share that
information until the third date.

24:23.502 --> 24:24.902
Why?

24:24.936 --> 24:26.036
Oh!

24:26.071 --> 24:27.738
Oh, no.

24:27.772 --> 24:30.109
April's all mad at me
that I slept with other women

24:30.129 --> 24:32.290
before she and I were a couple.

24:32.310 --> 24:33.811
I don't know what to do about it, man.

24:33.845 --> 24:35.479
Maybe she's not mad.

24:35.514 --> 24:37.281
Maybe she's just shocked you were able

24:37.315 --> 24:39.650
to find multiple women who were
willing to sleep with you.

24:39.684 --> 24:41.819
Thank you for that, Harry.

24:41.853 --> 24:43.621
[Laughs]

24:48.360 --> 24:51.762
Hey. We need to talk.

24:51.796 --> 24:54.165
[Groans] What did I do now?

24:54.199 --> 24:56.400
It's not a bad talk.

24:56.434 --> 24:59.670
It's just now that you're
making friend with boys...

24:59.704 --> 25:01.094
Oh, my gosh. No.

25:01.114 --> 25:03.073
I just want to make sure
that you're being safe

25:03.108 --> 25:05.109
and feeling in control of your decisions

25:05.143 --> 25:07.144
and empowered to say no if you want to.

25:07.179 --> 25:10.174
Will you come out from behind
the pillow for a second?

25:11.716 --> 25:13.851
What are you talking about?

25:13.885 --> 25:17.454
Well, I am talking about sex.

25:17.489 --> 25:19.523
Because I found some...

25:19.558 --> 25:23.427
protection in your jacket... A condom.

25:23.461 --> 25:24.828
Ew, no!

25:24.863 --> 25:26.664
They gave those out in health class.

25:26.698 --> 25:28.132
I forgot it was even there.

25:28.166 --> 25:29.600
Health class?

25:29.634 --> 25:32.503
Oh, thank God.

25:32.537 --> 25:33.771
[Sighs]

25:33.805 --> 25:36.173
So, you and Noel...

25:36.208 --> 25:39.432
Mom, stop it. We're friends.

25:39.811 --> 25:41.545
We haven't kissed or anything.

25:41.580 --> 25:43.681
So, are you a couple?

25:43.715 --> 25:46.890
Our generation doesn't really
put labels on things.

25:49.821 --> 25:52.656
I do hope that you'll
wait until you're older.

25:52.691 --> 25:54.491
It's a big deal.

25:54.526 --> 25:56.493
And I don't want you to end up
regretting something.

25:56.528 --> 26:00.798
Because some boys,
they will say anything,

26:00.832 --> 26:02.633
even say they love you
to get what they want.

26:02.667 --> 26:04.902
And maybe Noel is a great kid,
but you don't know

26:04.936 --> 26:08.854
what he's really thinking
or what he really wants.

26:11.209 --> 26:13.234
Are we done with the talk yet?

26:13.472 --> 26:16.347
We can be done, yes, as long
as you heard what I had to say.

26:16.381 --> 26:18.415
- I did. I promise.
- [Sighs]

26:18.450 --> 26:21.419
You know you can talk
to me about anything.

26:26.884 --> 26:28.993
[Vivian cries]
Okay, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

26:29.027 --> 26:31.262
[Door opens]

26:31.296 --> 26:33.731
What's going on?
Is she still not better?

26:33.765 --> 26:35.699
Like I said in my text,
the thermometer says she's fine,

26:35.734 --> 26:38.202
but she feels really warm.

26:39.435 --> 26:40.718
She's burning up.

26:40.738 --> 26:42.606
- Do you want me to page her pediatrician?
- Don't bother.

26:42.641 --> 26:45.072
He'll just tell us to
meet him in the E.R.,

26:45.092 --> 26:46.577
which is where I'm taking her right now.

26:46.611 --> 26:49.580
All right, sweetie.
All right, sweetie. I got you.

26:49.614 --> 26:51.415
- Here.
- It's okay, sweetie.

26:51.449 --> 26:54.018
Oh, baby.

26:54.052 --> 26:56.320
Okay. Thank you.

26:58.290 --> 27:00.724
Joss.

27:00.759 --> 27:03.193
- Thank you so much for coming in.
- Mm-hmm. Happy to.

27:03.228 --> 27:04.862
You know, Harry's important to me,

27:04.896 --> 27:07.264
and I just want to make
this right for him, so...

27:07.299 --> 27:08.632
And I'm sure we all can agree

27:08.667 --> 27:11.735
that this was a misunderstanding.

27:16.241 --> 27:17.741
Um, I'm sorry.

27:20.779 --> 27:22.446
That's your apology?

27:22.480 --> 27:24.230
After what you did to me?

27:24.476 --> 27:27.418
You have a broken elbow, okay? Chill
out. It could have been much worse.

27:27.452 --> 27:30.241
Okay, you get your little power play.
What more do you want from me?

27:30.261 --> 27:32.323
I want to know that you mean it.

27:32.357 --> 27:33.957
I want you to beg for my forgiveness.

27:33.992 --> 27:37.588
Okay, you can stop right now
because that's not happening.

27:37.608 --> 27:39.797
You know, I'm... I'm so sorry, Jonathan.

27:39.831 --> 27:40.864
You think you're the good guy here,

27:40.899 --> 27:42.834
but you should know
that your nephew is the one

27:42.854 --> 27:44.668
who belongs in jail, which is
where he's gonna end up soon,

27:44.703 --> 27:46.768
given the coddling that's
happening in this family.

27:46.788 --> 27:48.639
- Excuse me?
- And that's the best-case scenario.

27:48.673 --> 27:50.674
Worse case scenario is
that this spoiled kid

27:50.709 --> 27:52.176
hurts or kills someone else.

27:52.210 --> 27:53.677
You know, I should have
taken care of you

27:53.712 --> 27:55.112
in that hallway
instead of not fighting back.

27:55.146 --> 27:56.847
Then we wouldn't have a problem here.

27:56.881 --> 27:58.338
Oh, please. You can't hurt me.

27:58.358 --> 27:59.850
You want to press charges,
go right ahead.

27:59.884 --> 28:01.652
I've done this before.
The truth always comes out.

28:01.686 --> 28:03.153
You know what you did.

28:03.188 --> 28:05.056
Think you can put me in jail?
Fine. Try it.

28:05.076 --> 28:07.091
I'll be waiting.

28:10.528 --> 28:11.762
Excuse me.

28:11.796 --> 28:13.761
How much longer will we have to wait?

28:13.781 --> 28:15.499
Well, there's still many people
ahead of your child

28:15.533 --> 28:17.835
with more serious symptoms.

28:17.869 --> 28:19.770
Actually, I'm a doctor,
and I can tell you

28:19.804 --> 28:21.546
that Vivian's symptoms
are quite serious.

28:21.566 --> 28:23.273
Man: Nurse, I need some help over here.

28:23.308 --> 28:25.676
- Have a seat. Someone will be with you.
- Wait. We're not done.

28:25.710 --> 28:27.444
Come back here! We're not done.

28:27.479 --> 28:29.346
[Scoffs]

28:32.517 --> 28:34.651
[Knock on door]

28:36.921 --> 28:40.891
- I didn't know where else to go.
- [Vivian cries]

28:45.190 --> 28:46.794
She's a little wheezy,
and it hasn't stopped.

28:46.829 --> 28:49.777
I think it's whooping
cough or pneumonia.

28:49.797 --> 28:51.297
And they wouldn't see her at the E.R.

28:51.332 --> 28:52.765
and I couldn't sit there for hours

28:52.800 --> 28:54.600
with a sick baby
breathing in those germs.

28:54.635 --> 28:57.570
Of course not. You're her mother.
You did the right thing for her.

28:57.604 --> 29:00.770
Do you want me to take a look at her?

29:01.765 --> 29:03.443
It is your specialty.

29:03.477 --> 29:04.744
Okay.

29:04.778 --> 29:05.845
Can you get me my bag?

29:05.879 --> 29:07.513
Of course. Yeah.

29:07.548 --> 29:09.115
I know.

29:09.149 --> 29:10.984
Okay.

29:11.018 --> 29:12.285
[Door opens]

29:12.319 --> 29:13.899
Joss: Hey.

29:14.154 --> 29:15.544
Hey.

29:17.232 --> 29:19.481
So, um, I just saw Reza.

29:19.501 --> 29:20.640
Again.

29:20.660 --> 29:22.561
I went to apologize.

29:22.595 --> 29:25.530
You did? Okay. Great.

29:25.565 --> 29:27.866
How'd it go?

29:27.900 --> 29:29.234
Well...

29:29.268 --> 29:30.902
Well?

29:30.937 --> 29:33.839
No. Um... not well.

29:33.873 --> 29:36.917
You know, Harry, I-I tried.
Really, I did.

29:36.937 --> 29:39.239
So, what? That... That's it?

29:39.273 --> 29:40.406
Now he's gonna press charges?

29:40.441 --> 29:42.542
- I don't know. Maybe.
- Joss...

29:42.576 --> 29:44.210
You know, they probably
won't do anything anyway.

29:44.245 --> 29:45.211
It would just be bad press for them.

29:45.246 --> 29:47.180
Hey, even if that's true,
how am I supposed

29:47.214 --> 29:50.025
to go back and work
with Jonathan after this?

29:50.045 --> 29:52.185
What? Why would you want to?

29:52.219 --> 29:54.921
- I mean, I'm not going to.
- Because it's my job, our livelihood.

29:54.955 --> 29:56.856
No, I get that, Harry,
but Jonathan is clearly

29:56.891 --> 29:58.324
a slimeball who's enabling this kid.

29:58.359 --> 30:00.493
Why would you want to work
with someone like that?

30:00.527 --> 30:01.594
Jonathan loves his family.

30:01.629 --> 30:03.029
That doesn't make him a slimeball.

30:03.063 --> 30:04.530
In fact, he's trying
to help the situation.

30:04.565 --> 30:05.999
And the fact that you'd do something

30:06.033 --> 30:08.201
to risk my entire career, Joss.

30:09.303 --> 30:11.371
Uh, wow.

30:11.405 --> 30:13.339
I'm sorry, Harry.

30:13.374 --> 30:15.467
I didn't mean to do that.

30:16.577 --> 30:19.078
Where is all this rage
coming from, Joss?

30:19.113 --> 30:20.880
[Sighs]

30:20.915 --> 30:22.682
Hey.

30:22.716 --> 30:23.850
Can we talk about it?

30:23.884 --> 30:25.905
[Gasps] No, you know what, Harry?
I'm just... I'm really...

30:25.925 --> 30:29.134
I think I'm all talked out
for the moment.

30:31.558 --> 30:33.059
It's not whooping cough.

30:33.093 --> 30:34.427
So it's pneumonia?

30:34.461 --> 30:36.930
A moderate case.
I have some amoxicillin on hand.

30:36.950 --> 30:38.731
I'm gonna give her 350 milligrams.

30:38.766 --> 30:40.633
- Sound good?
- Yeah.

30:40.668 --> 30:41.901
Perfect.

30:41.936 --> 30:43.636
Okay.

30:43.671 --> 30:46.472
We will be back.

30:46.507 --> 30:49.375
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

30:54.682 --> 30:58.318
I can't imagine how hard
it was for you, coming here.

30:58.352 --> 30:59.619
[Sighs]

30:59.653 --> 31:01.487
I owe you an apology.

31:01.522 --> 31:04.457
I'm the one who started all of this,
and you didn't deserve that.

31:04.491 --> 31:07.226
And I didn't mean all those
things that I said. I just...

31:07.261 --> 31:10.430
I got caught up in the moment.

31:10.464 --> 31:12.932
So I'm sorry.

31:12.967 --> 31:15.301
I appreciate that.

31:15.336 --> 31:18.237
This certainly isn't
how I expected things to go

31:18.272 --> 31:19.639
when you came back to town.

31:19.673 --> 31:22.241
[Chuckles] Me neither.

31:23.377 --> 31:29.282
And I think you were right,
about me blaming you.

31:29.316 --> 31:30.416
Really?

31:30.451 --> 31:33.419
Yeah, I think I was trying
to punish you in some way,

31:33.454 --> 31:36.622
but only 'cause I wanted
to punish myself.

31:36.657 --> 31:38.925
I felt guilty about leaving,
and I lashed out.

31:38.959 --> 31:41.127
I could tell how much
you cared about Vivian

31:41.161 --> 31:43.496
from the moment I saw you two together.

31:43.530 --> 31:47.533
So, maybe we can try
to work this out amicably?

31:47.568 --> 31:49.435
I'd like that.

31:49.470 --> 31:52.005
But I'd also like to be
a part of Vivian's life,

31:52.039 --> 31:53.606
if that's okay with you.

31:53.640 --> 31:55.508
Of course. I want you to be.

31:55.542 --> 31:58.778
It's what Vivian would have wanted.

32:00.647 --> 32:01.814
Yeah.

32:01.849 --> 32:02.949
[Footsteps approaching]

32:02.983 --> 32:04.617
She did great.

32:06.520 --> 32:08.454
[Giggles] She's gonna be just fine.

32:08.489 --> 32:09.989
Mm-hmm.

32:10.024 --> 32:13.493
Hello. Did you say "thank you"?

32:13.527 --> 32:14.694
Yeah?

32:19.833 --> 32:22.335
Harry. There you are.

32:22.369 --> 32:23.642
Whew.

32:23.662 --> 32:25.405
This... It's going to sound crazy,

32:25.439 --> 32:27.840
but you know how sometimes
the universe puts people

32:27.875 --> 32:29.409
in your path, and...

32:29.443 --> 32:31.444
Hey. Are you okay?

32:31.478 --> 32:35.581
Yeah. Yeah. No. I'm...
It's just more Joss stuff.

32:35.616 --> 32:38.718
You mean because she beat a guy
up and lied to you about it?

32:38.752 --> 32:42.321
Yeah, that, and now she wants
me to cut ties with Jonathan.

32:42.356 --> 32:44.357
What? Why? He didn't do anything.

32:44.391 --> 32:47.344
Yeah, I know, but it's his nephew.

32:47.364 --> 32:49.395
You know, I really don't want to give up

32:49.430 --> 32:52.231
everything I've been working
toward and start from scratch,

32:52.266 --> 32:54.500
but then I feel like I'm being selfish

32:54.535 --> 32:56.069
for even thinking that way.

32:56.103 --> 32:57.670
I like Joss.

32:57.704 --> 32:59.272
I really do.

32:59.306 --> 33:02.575
But this isn't about her.

33:02.609 --> 33:03.949
Ever since we were little kids,

33:04.046 --> 33:05.912
running your own restaurant's
always been your dream.

33:05.946 --> 33:07.485
Yeah, but I can
do that without Jonathan.

33:07.505 --> 33:09.682
Let's be real. There aren't that
many gajillionaires out there

33:09.716 --> 33:12.051
who will write you a blank check
and let you do whatever you want.

33:12.086 --> 33:15.154
Yeah, I know, but Joss is
going through a lot right now.

33:16.123 --> 33:19.459
Well, just because someone you're
with asks you to do something,

33:19.493 --> 33:21.810
it doesn't mean you have to do it.

33:22.197 --> 33:24.530
No, I don't have to do anything,

33:24.565 --> 33:26.532
but it'd be nice
to have her support here.

33:26.567 --> 33:28.568
Eventually, she'll be fine.

33:28.602 --> 33:32.438
You have to decide
what is right for you.

33:32.473 --> 33:35.908
You don't need permission
to go after what you want.

33:35.943 --> 33:39.712
In love or business or life.

33:42.349 --> 33:43.950
It's your call.

33:48.255 --> 33:51.224
Good talk. Okay.

33:56.663 --> 33:59.465
[Lucy crying]

34:01.135 --> 34:03.000
Lucy?

34:03.704 --> 34:05.314
What happened?

34:13.147 --> 34:15.681
- Who's that?
- Noel and Tania Stevens.

34:15.716 --> 34:17.516
So, what's wrong?

34:17.551 --> 34:19.619
I've seen them together before.

34:19.652 --> 34:22.487
But he never told me they
hung out outside of school.

34:22.523 --> 34:24.090
He's obviously into her,

34:24.123 --> 34:26.025
or else he would have
said something to me.

34:26.059 --> 34:28.327
And you're basing this
off of one picture?

34:28.362 --> 34:30.696
Well, since he lied about this,

34:30.731 --> 34:33.599
who knows what else he's lying about?

34:33.634 --> 34:35.333
[Sighs] You were right.

34:35.369 --> 34:36.636
I was?

34:36.670 --> 34:38.004
About what?

34:38.038 --> 34:39.505
About what you said about boys.

34:39.540 --> 34:42.014
That they lie
and I shouldn't trust them.

34:42.226 --> 34:44.110
Oh, sweetie, that's not what I said.

34:44.143 --> 34:46.145
Or not what I meant.

34:46.179 --> 34:48.214
I just want you to be careful.

34:48.248 --> 34:52.717
I did not mean to put all these
fears inside of your head.

34:52.753 --> 34:56.656
That's my baggage, and it has
nothing to do with you, really.

34:56.690 --> 34:58.824
But what if boys do lie to me?

34:59.889 --> 35:02.995
Relationships have
a lot of ups and downs.

35:03.030 --> 35:06.299
And at some point, you may get hurt.

35:06.969 --> 35:09.135
But I hope that you'll go
into every relationship

35:09.169 --> 35:11.237
expecting the best.

35:11.271 --> 35:14.574
- Is that what you did with Marc?
- Yes.

35:14.608 --> 35:18.978
Even after dating lots of
not-so-trustworthy people,

35:19.524 --> 35:21.514
I still trust Marc.

35:23.083 --> 35:25.484
- Good. I like Marc.
- I do, too.

35:25.519 --> 35:30.389
âª 'Cause you, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh âª

35:30.424 --> 35:32.491
âª You got me in the palm of your âª

35:32.526 --> 35:37.029
âª Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh âª

35:37.064 --> 35:41.133
âª Got me in quicksand âª

35:46.707 --> 35:48.541
That was beautiful.

35:48.575 --> 35:50.599
Thanks. Your lyrics are awesome.

35:50.619 --> 35:52.429
- It's about my ex.
- Mm.

35:52.449 --> 35:56.686
Had this crazy tumultuous
relationship years ago.

35:56.720 --> 35:58.888
And I kind of broke his heart.

35:58.923 --> 36:00.423
Do I know this guy?

36:00.457 --> 36:01.624
Maybe.

36:01.659 --> 36:03.226
Yeah.

36:03.260 --> 36:05.862
We had an amazing musical connection,

36:05.896 --> 36:10.700
and the sex was... well, you know.

36:14.805 --> 36:17.632
Sofia, the guy in this song
has moved on.

36:18.509 --> 36:20.610
He's happy.

36:20.644 --> 36:23.780
And I'm happy for you. Really.

36:24.703 --> 36:27.283
I just guess...

36:27.318 --> 36:29.619
What?

36:29.653 --> 36:31.654
I guess there's some part of me

36:31.689 --> 36:33.289
that always thought when I finally

36:33.324 --> 36:37.393
got my stuff together
and you got yours together,

36:37.428 --> 36:40.045
someday, we'd end up as two old people

36:40.151 --> 36:41.898
singing folk songs on our front porch.

36:41.932 --> 36:46.169
Yeah, I know. I used to think
the same thing back then.

37:03.426 --> 37:06.279
Hey. How did rehearsal go?

37:06.299 --> 37:07.521
Fine.

37:09.624 --> 37:11.592
How did the sex talk go?

37:11.626 --> 37:14.528
Good. Then bad. Then good again.

37:14.563 --> 37:16.330
So, better than our sex talk?

37:16.364 --> 37:19.533
[Sighs] Let's forget about our sex talk.

37:19.568 --> 37:21.542
That was so stupid, okay?

37:24.105 --> 37:26.774
- What was that for?
- For being in my life.

37:26.808 --> 37:28.375
After everything I've been through,

37:28.410 --> 37:31.345
I am so lucky
I found someone I can trust.

37:33.101 --> 37:35.749
Okay, I have to get back
to the store, but remember,

37:35.784 --> 37:37.518
we're going out for dinner tonight.

37:37.552 --> 37:39.553
Yeah.

37:43.758 --> 37:45.826
[Exhales deeply]

37:48.396 --> 37:50.030
[Knock on door]

37:51.800 --> 37:53.767
Hey.

37:53.802 --> 37:56.036
So, how'd it go with Joss and Harry?

37:57.739 --> 38:00.307
Exactly as... As I expected.

38:00.342 --> 38:01.442
Which is...?

38:03.845 --> 38:06.547
They're totally cool with it.

38:06.581 --> 38:08.782
- Really? Huh.
- Mm-hmm.

38:08.817 --> 38:10.718
I mean, I don't think
the four of us should be

38:10.752 --> 38:14.255
throwing down shots anytime
soon, but they understand.

38:15.408 --> 38:16.490
Wow, I, um...

38:16.524 --> 38:18.626
Well, look, I get off
here in like [mutters]

38:18.660 --> 38:19.996
like around an hour.

38:20.016 --> 38:22.814
You want to, like, you know,
do a movie with dinner?

38:22.834 --> 38:24.968
- Mm. I would love that.
- Yeah?

38:25.002 --> 38:27.604
First, I'd like to deal with
my follow-up appointment.

38:27.638 --> 38:29.406
Yeah, I definitely owe you that.

38:29.440 --> 38:31.675
- Mmm.
- This is a great idea.

38:31.709 --> 38:33.009
Mm-hmm.

38:33.631 --> 38:36.646
Here you go... a list
of lawyers that specialize

38:36.681 --> 38:40.617
in family court but are a little
less scrupulous than I am.

38:40.651 --> 38:42.819
If that's still what you're looking for.

38:42.854 --> 38:45.489
I'm sorry about that outburst yesterday.

38:45.523 --> 38:47.424
You caught me in weak moment.

38:47.458 --> 38:49.659
Okay, well, you were
worried about your kid.

38:49.694 --> 38:51.995
But, luckily, now I don't have to be.

38:52.681 --> 38:55.532
- Alec is dropping the suit?
- Yeah. I think we solved it.

38:55.566 --> 38:58.869
[Laughs] I'm so glad to hear that.

38:58.903 --> 39:02.372
Thank you for always
being there, for all of us.

39:02.406 --> 39:04.641
Oh, well, I wish I could
get rid of you ladies.

39:04.675 --> 39:06.643
[Chuckles]

39:06.677 --> 39:09.980
So, you're happy?

39:10.014 --> 39:12.949
I am. You know? Marriage can do that.

39:12.984 --> 39:15.152
[Laughs] It's eight months and counting.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.187
Congratulations. Good luck.

39:17.221 --> 39:18.722
Thanks.

39:18.756 --> 39:21.191
Take care of yourself, Karen.

39:21.225 --> 39:22.659
[Door opens]

39:25.062 --> 39:27.197
[Door closes]

39:27.231 --> 39:29.566
âª

39:29.600 --> 39:31.868
[Women grunting]

39:36.174 --> 39:37.807
[Grunts]

39:46.717 --> 39:48.718
So, you're still doing this, huh?

39:48.753 --> 39:50.364
I need to.

39:50.522 --> 39:52.088
I-I tried to explain it, you know.

39:52.123 --> 39:54.024
I can't help it if
you don't understand, Harry.

39:54.058 --> 39:56.660
What I don't understand is how you
can't see what's happening, Joss.

39:56.694 --> 39:59.162
How this, whatever it is
you're doing in here,

39:59.197 --> 40:01.198
almost got you arrested again.

40:03.034 --> 40:05.769
Thankfully, Jonathan talked
Reza out of it. For now.

40:07.481 --> 40:09.239
But I am gonna keep working with him.

40:11.642 --> 40:13.009
It's your call to make.

40:15.146 --> 40:17.214
Joss, have you thought about
seeing a therapist?

40:17.248 --> 40:19.049
I see one all the time.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.050
I do not mean Karen.

40:20.084 --> 40:23.340
I mean someone that you'll actually
talk to about what happened.

40:23.665 --> 40:26.859
Since that's clearly not gonna be me.

40:27.325 --> 40:29.125
Just consider it, okay?

40:29.160 --> 40:31.127
Sure, yeah.

40:31.162 --> 40:32.462
I-I'll consider it.

40:33.735 --> 40:36.066
All right. Well, see you at home?

40:36.100 --> 40:37.793
Sounds good.

40:41.806 --> 40:44.975
âª Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh âª

40:45.009 --> 40:48.612
âª Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh âª

40:48.646 --> 40:50.914
[Laughs]

40:51.705 --> 40:53.665
Hey, do you want to get some
ice cream before we go home?

40:53.685 --> 40:55.675
[Laughs] Are you kidding? I am so full.

40:55.695 --> 40:56.753
Are you sure?

40:56.787 --> 40:59.148
'Cause you could be dying
for a scoop of cookie dough

40:59.168 --> 41:00.871
and not even realize it.

41:01.452 --> 41:03.010
Oh, yeah. I guess I am.

41:03.030 --> 41:05.236
[Chuckles] Great.
I might get something, too.

41:05.256 --> 41:07.439
- [Laughs]
- [Cellphone ringing]

41:07.459 --> 41:08.865
Hold this.

41:12.872 --> 41:14.671
Hello?

41:15.195 --> 41:17.465
Yes, this is April Malloy.

41:18.591 --> 41:20.931
- What do you mean?
- Everything okay?

41:20.951 --> 41:22.709
A car crash?

41:22.729 --> 41:24.691
What happened? Is she okay?
