WEBVTT

01:09.027 --> 01:10.737
Goddamn it.

01:10.821 --> 01:13.824
This shit ought to be loose enough
for me to jimmy it up.

01:14.616 --> 01:15.951
Shit!

01:17.619 --> 01:19.496
- How about this?
- Turn it other way. Other way.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.748
- Other way. Sorry.
- There you go. Hit it with the head.

01:21.832 --> 01:24.459
Now, jimmy. Jimmy it up. Jimmy it up.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.545
There you go. Come on. One more time.

01:27.629 --> 01:28.630
There you go.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.303
This one's loose.

01:36.138 --> 01:38.682
Whew! What?

01:39.433 --> 01:42.102
- Yep. That's it.
- What's this?

01:46.732 --> 01:48.275
Come on. Open it.

01:58.202 --> 01:59.203
Well, ain't nothin' in there.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.039
Open it then.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.749
I thought you said treasure.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.219
See?

02:17.179 --> 02:18.764
Why don't you go ahead
and keep this here one?

02:18.847 --> 02:22.893
Then we gonna see in a little while
what you call that "nothing."

02:23.727 --> 02:27.523
I was 12 years old
when I left Mississippi.

02:30.651 --> 02:34.404
I left
'cause of all that death and sufferin'.

02:36.240 --> 02:40.285
I left, but not before I kept my promise.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.746
I followed the path.

02:42.829 --> 02:46.250
I followed his every direction.

02:46.333 --> 02:51.129
Found Coy's treasure,
14 stolen gold pieces.

02:51.213 --> 02:53.298
So, these coins--

02:55.509 --> 02:56.635
Doubloons.

02:57.553 --> 03:00.597
Doubloons is what they is,
like pirate treasure.

03:01.557 --> 03:04.226
Okay. These doubloons,
they're worth real money?

03:04.309 --> 03:05.435
Sure is.

03:05.519 --> 03:08.230
All right, so you said there was 14,
and I only see two.

03:09.815 --> 03:13.902
You know, Sensia, she liked pretty things.

03:13.986 --> 03:16.238
You know, jewelry,
that little comb you like

03:16.321 --> 03:20.242
and, oh, I'd say
a hundred or so silk dresses.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.369
'Course you went
and spent this money on impressing her.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.913
Celebrating her.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.500
I was crazy about that woman.

03:28.584 --> 03:32.004
But I wasn't crazy enough
to spend all that money on gifts.

03:32.504 --> 03:34.756
Then she got cancer,

03:34.840 --> 03:38.552
and the insurance bills show.

03:38.635 --> 03:42.181
And that's when I started
cashing in the coins.

03:42.264 --> 03:44.766
Even though I knew
that wasn't what Coydog wanted.

03:45.475 --> 03:48.270
But he's been dead for like
a hundred years. What could he want?

03:49.563 --> 03:52.816
Me to spend that money
to save our people.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.610
What? Like Black people?

03:55.736 --> 03:57.446
Okay. You were like ten years old.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.240
Oh, no. Seven going on eight.

04:00.324 --> 04:03.452
Yeah. So, how's a kid supposed to be
responsible for all that?

04:03.535 --> 04:07.956
Well, I spent most of my life
trying to figure that out.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.501
Then Sensia come along.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.086
I'd do anything in the world
for that woman.

04:13.754 --> 04:17.257
But in the end, I failed her and Coy.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.802
This my last chance to do what I promised.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.180
With these two.

04:25.891 --> 04:28.894
All right, so… what's this?
What this open?

04:28.977 --> 04:31.063
In due time, little bird.

04:32.481 --> 04:35.192
In due time.

04:40.572 --> 04:41.615
Thank you.

04:41.698 --> 04:42.699
You're welcome.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.915
And where you going with that?

04:51.542 --> 04:52.793
Knockout drops.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.509
Doubloons.

05:05.264 --> 05:06.348
Get him up.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.809
- Watch out. That's it.
- Come on.

05:08.892 --> 05:09.893
That's right.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.728
Come on. Come on. Help me.

05:12.771 --> 05:15.274
- Bring that thing over here.
- Put it around his neck.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.608
There you go. Get him up.

05:17.776 --> 05:19.403
Get that can of juice.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.826
- Hold him now.
- Stand still.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.327
Get up there, boy.

05:29.746 --> 05:32.249
Come on. That's right.

05:35.878 --> 05:38.130
Come on. Get up there.

05:38.213 --> 05:40.591
- Tell us what you know.
- I can't breathe.

05:41.175 --> 05:42.634
Go ahead.

05:45.429 --> 05:46.889
Easy, boy.

05:46.972 --> 05:49.474
The only way you'd make it
through this night

05:49.558 --> 05:51.101
is to give me back what's mine.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.437
You better talk.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.564
Kerosene, boy.

05:55.647 --> 05:57.482
Better tell the man
what he wants to hear.

05:57.566 --> 05:59.193
What they call "highly flammable."

06:01.945 --> 06:03.530
Son of a--

06:03.614 --> 06:05.115
Look out.

06:05.199 --> 06:06.408
You better watch it, boy.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.535
Tell me where my things is at, boy!

06:09.494 --> 06:10.746
Or you fry.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.540
No! Burning!

06:13.624 --> 06:16.084
We don't want to kill him yet!

06:16.168 --> 06:19.379
I need this nigger alive until he talks.

06:19.463 --> 06:22.341
- Get him down!
- Bring him down. Bring him down.

06:22.424 --> 06:24.176
I gotcha.

08:15.746 --> 08:16.705
Help me.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.317
What you doing?

09:27.401 --> 09:30.779
I was-- I was just thinking,
hey, that this-- this sofa

09:30.863 --> 09:33.115
ain't no place
for a young girl to be sleepin'.

09:33.198 --> 09:34.283
It ain't that bad.

09:34.366 --> 09:35.951
You didn't like it
when you first come here.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.536
Yeah, well, a lot has changed since then.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.621
You ain't like my ass
that much either.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.833
That's not true.
At least not no more.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.336
You said that boy who used to work
with Reggie wanna come by here?

09:46.420 --> 09:48.422
Roger Dawes. Yeah.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.299
- Tell him to come on.
- You sure?

09:50.382 --> 09:53.093
Yeah, I remember him.
He from-- he from down-home.

09:54.386 --> 09:55.721
All right.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.822
Bird, give me a hand.

10:16.825 --> 10:17.868
What you doing?

10:17.951 --> 10:20.162
- I'm gonna need you to help. Help.
- All right. All right.

10:20.245 --> 10:21.872
All right. Come on.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.708
It's heavy 'cause of all--
all this change in it.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.133
Shit.

10:34.426 --> 10:36.428
Where you get all this?

10:36.970 --> 10:39.181
Back before I lost my marbles,

10:40.015 --> 10:42.267
I used to cash my retirement checks.

10:42.351 --> 10:44.520
And what I ain't use, I put in here.

10:44.603 --> 10:45.604
How much is it?

10:45.687 --> 10:49.024
I don't know.
Been a while since I been in it.

10:49.107 --> 10:53.445
So I'm gonna have to say, oh, 40, 50.

10:53.529 --> 10:55.572
- Forty or 50 what?
- Thousand.

10:58.367 --> 11:01.119
Yeah. You shouldn't show me all that.

11:01.203 --> 11:02.746
You scared of money?

11:04.206 --> 11:06.083
My daddy was killed
over some money he owed.

11:07.084 --> 11:10.212
And my mama used to do stuff for money.

11:10.295 --> 11:13.966
I get scared too,
but you got to carry on.

11:14.049 --> 11:17.427
Plus, you need a good night's sleep
on a good bed.

11:17.511 --> 11:20.138
And you need some new clothes
and some spending money.

11:20.222 --> 11:23.433
That's money for me to make.
You should keep your own money.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.477
What I need with money when I got gold?

11:25.561 --> 11:28.272
You can't pay your bills
with them old coins.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.399
That show what you know.

11:36.989 --> 11:40.033
Well, you still gotta
get it out this ugly-ass suitcase.

11:40.117 --> 11:41.577
Ugly-ass suitcase? What you talking about?

11:41.660 --> 11:45.914
This genuine imported alligator
from Florida, Louisiana,

11:45.998 --> 11:48.333
where they grow
them exotic-ass alligators.

11:48.417 --> 11:50.544
This here the real shit. Feel that.

11:50.627 --> 11:51.837
Shit.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.380
It don't come no better than this here.

11:53.463 --> 11:55.507
Yeah, well, it's still trouble
waiting to happen.

11:56.258 --> 11:58.302
Well, what you want me to do with it?

11:59.553 --> 12:01.847
And this account is to be in her name?

12:02.472 --> 12:03.765
No, ma'am.

12:03.849 --> 12:07.895
No, he wants this account so he can have
what you call a debit card.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.147
I see.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.358
And you want this checking account
separate from the one you already have?

12:13.442 --> 12:15.360
Whatever you think's best.

12:15.444 --> 12:17.863
- You want online access as well?
- Yeah.

12:17.946 --> 12:21.533
I just want to open a new checking account
for my-- for my closet money.

12:21.617 --> 12:25.787
Well, you have nearly $4,000
in your savings account already, Mr. Grey.

12:28.749 --> 12:32.127
I appreciate you, Ms. Brooks,
and I understand you.

12:32.211 --> 12:34.630
See, you think Robyn here

12:34.713 --> 12:37.174
is trying to get at my savings account

12:37.257 --> 12:39.426
by having me open a checking account
with a few dollars,

12:39.510 --> 12:42.429
so she can come in through the back door.

12:42.513 --> 12:45.682
But there's one thing wrong
with your suspicion.

12:46.183 --> 12:47.768
Help me with this here, Bird.

12:55.776 --> 13:00.572
This here is near about $40,000.

13:00.656 --> 13:04.868
You would think that if Bird here
wanted to rob me,

13:05.494 --> 13:08.872
don't you think she would've
just run on off with all this cash?

13:08.956 --> 13:11.291
Ain't no way I could prove she done it.

13:12.209 --> 13:15.754
See? I think we understand
each other now, huh?

13:16.338 --> 13:18.257
- Yes, we do, Mr. Grey.
- Good.

13:18.340 --> 13:22.636
Now, I'm gonna put most of this here money
in that checking account we talking about.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.930
And I'm gonna take the rest and

13:25.013 --> 13:28.892
take care of some pertinent business
that I got on my mind.

13:32.187 --> 13:34.731
All you have to do is pull this here.

13:35.399 --> 13:36.400
So easy, a child could do it.

13:38.694 --> 13:39.695
All right.

13:39.778 --> 13:41.738
Thank y'all. Here you go.

13:42.281 --> 13:44.241
- For you.
- Thank you.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.285
You still want us
to move that old couch out?

13:46.368 --> 13:48.787
Sure do. That would-- That would--
That would-- That'd be a big help.

13:49.454 --> 13:50.455
Thank you.

13:52.791 --> 13:54.334
Watch your step over there now.

13:56.086 --> 13:58.422
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing?

13:59.006 --> 14:01.717
What are-- Oh, my God.

14:01.800 --> 14:02.885
Oh, my God.

14:08.932 --> 14:10.684
Is y'all still here? Get outta here.

14:12.811 --> 14:14.271
This is the first real bed I ever had.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.356
Oh, it-- it-- it ain't really a bed.

14:16.440 --> 14:17.691
- Well, it's real to me.
- But it got

14:17.774 --> 14:19.860
three real strong slats in it,

14:19.943 --> 14:21.820
so it won't hurt your back
when you sleep on it.

14:22.404 --> 14:24.323
But I ain't ever have a real bed before.

14:24.406 --> 14:25.782
Not even at your mama's house?

14:25.866 --> 14:27.034
No, just a sleeping bag.

14:27.659 --> 14:28.660
Well, you like it?

14:30.287 --> 14:31.663
It's beautiful.

14:31.747 --> 14:33.290
It is beautiful.

14:33.832 --> 14:34.917
Like that dress too.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.002
Oh, yes, yes. It's nice, right?

14:37.085 --> 14:39.546
- Got it on sale.
- What you got in these sacks over here?

14:39.630 --> 14:42.549
I got a couple more outfits.
And the clothes that I--

14:42.633 --> 14:45.135
- that I went there with.
- And what brought this about?

14:45.219 --> 14:46.970
Nothing in particular.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.514
- You got a boyfriend.
- No, I don't!

14:48.597 --> 14:50.933
- You got a boyfriend.
- No particular reason.

14:51.683 --> 14:55.521
And then the preacher comes out and says,
"Well, this church for whites only."

14:55.604 --> 14:57.940
I told him, "I ain't want to come in.

14:58.023 --> 15:01.985
I just stopped 'cause your house of God
was so beautiful."

15:02.069 --> 15:04.863
I remember you told me and Reggie
that story a long time ago.

15:05.447 --> 15:09.284
I was-- I was just starting
to lose my mind for real, around then.

15:11.411 --> 15:15.624
So, Robyn here tell me that you been
working with Reggie a lot.

15:16.500 --> 15:20.087
He threw me work when he could.
Was always grateful. Every bit helps.

15:20.170 --> 15:23.549
You know, I'm in school. Or trying to be.
I'm taking classes when I can.

15:23.632 --> 15:25.467
Yeah, at the art institute.

15:25.551 --> 15:27.344
So you-- you a artist.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.428
Well, game design.

15:29.012 --> 15:30.013
Video games.

15:30.097 --> 15:32.599
Ain't nothing wrong
with being a carpenter now, you know.

15:32.683 --> 15:34.685
Yeah. But that's not--
that's not what he wants to do.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.436
Well, what is it you want to do?

15:36.520 --> 15:37.604
He just said it.

15:37.688 --> 15:40.691
No, he just said what he was in school
studyin' to do.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.401
What is it you really want to do
with your life?

15:42.484 --> 15:44.695
I mean, where you see yourself
in ten, 20 years?

15:44.778 --> 15:46.446
That's not really a fair question.

15:46.530 --> 15:48.448
That don't make it no less important.

15:48.532 --> 15:51.368
Okay, well, if it was so important,
how come you--

15:51.451 --> 15:53.036
you ain't never ask me nothin' like that?

15:53.120 --> 15:57.332
Listen, girl. Anybody know that you
gonna be whatever it is you choose to be.

15:57.916 --> 16:00.502
Now, man ain't got the luxury
of choosing like that.

16:00.586 --> 16:03.088
He-- He-- He got to get out there
and make something of hisself

16:03.172 --> 16:05.632
and do what need to be done
in this world.

16:05.716 --> 16:07.551
Maybe in your world.
But in this one,

16:07.634 --> 16:09.428
women are carrying
just as much of the load.

16:09.511 --> 16:13.390
They're running Fortune 500 companies,
getting elected into office,

16:13.473 --> 16:17.311
locking down the Nobel Peace Prize
for editing genomes and shit.

16:17.394 --> 16:19.021
They may even make it to Mars one day.

16:19.897 --> 16:22.691
Well, as for me, I'll still be here
on the earth, tryin' to figure it out.

16:22.774 --> 16:24.902
But I'm working on it, Mr. Grey.

16:25.611 --> 16:29.489
And as for carpentry, I like it, but you
gotta be good with people to do it.

16:30.073 --> 16:31.867
Reggie had a way with people.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.162
When the last time you seen Reggie?

16:35.871 --> 16:37.539
We had just finished
that job at Niecie's.

16:37.623 --> 16:39.249
Who else on that job with you?

16:39.333 --> 16:40.334
Just me and him.

16:41.710 --> 16:44.046
Did he seem worried
or bothered by anything?

16:44.129 --> 16:45.964
No. Same old Reggie.

16:49.635 --> 16:51.136
Did he pay you for doing that job?

16:51.220 --> 16:52.930
Why you gonna go
and ask him something like that?

16:53.013 --> 16:54.223
Actually, sir, no, he didn't.

16:54.306 --> 16:57.851
I figure, now that I know what happened,
he probably didn't have a chance to do it.

16:57.935 --> 16:59.061
See?

16:59.686 --> 17:02.523
- How much he owe you for that job?
- Oh, no, no, no, no, Mr. Grey. I mean--

17:03.774 --> 17:05.400
That's not why I'm here.

17:12.950 --> 17:15.993
Did I say the wrong thing?
It feels like I said the wrong thing.

17:16.078 --> 17:18.622
Oh, what? No.
There's no such thing as the wrong thing.

17:18.704 --> 17:19.705
How you figure?

17:19.790 --> 17:23.335
Well, is there a right way to talk
about somebody being murdered?

17:24.211 --> 17:25.671
Nah, guess not.

17:29.299 --> 17:30.884
Why didn't you take the money?

17:31.969 --> 17:33.136
'Cause of what I said.

17:33.637 --> 17:35.556
I came by 'cause I like the man.

17:42.437 --> 17:43.480
What was that?

17:43.981 --> 17:45.399
I don't know. Just 'cause.

17:46.692 --> 17:47.985
Don't make it a thing.

17:53.657 --> 17:57.494
<i>You ever worry about losing
your woman? Your family?</i>

17:59.705 --> 18:02.332
I got something I need to say,
and I don't…

18:03.959 --> 18:06.211
I don't know who else to say it to, Unc.

18:07.379 --> 18:09.965
It's about…

18:10.757 --> 18:12.467
Nina and me.

18:13.802 --> 18:15.721
<i>See, Nina--</i>

18:17.097 --> 18:20.559
<i>Nina got this ex-boyfriend
that went to prison for killing somebody.</i>

18:21.059 --> 18:23.061
<i>He then got out and--</i>

18:24.104 --> 18:26.148
<i>They been talking to each other.</i>

18:26.231 --> 18:28.442
<i>And I told her to leave him alone.</i>

18:29.610 --> 18:31.153
<i>She ain't listen.</i>

18:32.154 --> 18:35.908
So, I think I'ma just
pack her and the kids up

18:35.991 --> 18:38.577
and move on down to Texas.

18:38.660 --> 18:41.121
You know, we got people down there,
and…

18:42.080 --> 18:44.541
Plus-- Plus, if he leave Atlanta,

18:44.625 --> 18:46.877
that'll violate his parole, so--

18:50.672 --> 18:51.673
You still with me, Unc?

19:01.975 --> 19:03.393
Took your time coming back.

19:03.936 --> 19:06.480
- We was just talkin'.
- Talking about what?

19:06.563 --> 19:07.814
How he wants to take me to a movie.

19:07.898 --> 19:09.525
But I told him
I had to check in with you first.

19:09.608 --> 19:12.653
- Why? You don't answer to me.
- You don't want to know?

19:13.403 --> 19:14.613
I like the boy.

19:14.696 --> 19:16.907
Yeah, he's all right. Little corny.

19:18.325 --> 19:21.787
But he really did appreciate you
offering to pay him for Reggie.

19:21.870 --> 19:23.539
Like I said, I like the boy.

19:23.622 --> 19:27.042
Yeah. Well, you asked him
all those questions about Reggie,

19:27.125 --> 19:29.002
and that's the real reason
you want him stopping by.

19:29.086 --> 19:31.880
The boy a friend of Reggie's.
He know people we all know.

19:31.964 --> 19:33.590
I mean,
can't I ask him a couple questions?

19:33.674 --> 19:34.883
It's not about him.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.011
I'm worried about you.

19:39.012 --> 19:40.848
Well, don't worry about me.

19:40.931 --> 19:43.308
When you get to be a certain age,
you ain't scared no more.

19:43.392 --> 19:46.520
Yeah,
but what if ain't nothing left to find?

19:46.603 --> 19:48.814
What if you waste
what little time you have left

19:48.897 --> 19:50.774
looking for answers that ain't even there?

19:55.237 --> 19:57.614
So, how is your sleeping?

19:58.115 --> 19:59.324
Oh, well.

20:00.534 --> 20:01.869
Not much, really.

20:01.952 --> 20:04.496
You know, memories turn into dreams,

20:04.580 --> 20:07.332
and I… just can't cut 'em off.

20:07.416 --> 20:11.795
That happens to some patients.
I'm-- I am very sorry.

20:11.879 --> 20:13.338
It ain't nothing to be sorry about.

20:13.422 --> 20:16.758
Instead, I'm-- I'm lucky
to have my mind back at all.

20:20.137 --> 20:21.972
How long I'm gonna have it?

20:22.472 --> 20:24.766
Your vitality is amazing, Mr. Grey.

20:24.850 --> 20:27.144
It takes to the treatment like--

20:28.145 --> 20:30.522
like a fire to dried grass.

20:30.606 --> 20:33.650
And your mind--
your mind is completely alive,

20:33.734 --> 20:37.029
more so than anyone
that I've ever seen.

20:38.071 --> 20:43.660
But you also know that a fire like that
can only leave scorched earth.

20:44.995 --> 20:48.749
So I can't tell you
for how long that it will last.

20:48.832 --> 20:51.543
But I can tell you that it will be
the brightest light in the heavens.

20:56.006 --> 21:01.762
The man what helped raise me
was named Coydog.

21:02.429 --> 21:03.680
He said…

21:05.182 --> 21:09.269
Sin is a long road

21:09.353 --> 21:14.691
that run from downtown hell
to uptown heaven,

21:14.775 --> 21:17.027
and your sins determine

21:17.110 --> 21:20.739
where you stand on that road.

21:22.074 --> 21:26.370
But ain't no person all good or all bad,

21:26.453 --> 21:29.164
except God and the devil.

21:29.957 --> 21:31.041
Yeah.

21:32.334 --> 21:36.129
Coydog stole something from a white man.

21:37.422 --> 21:38.882
And when they caught him,

21:39.716 --> 21:41.260
they lynched him.

21:43.846 --> 21:45.389
And burnt him up.

21:46.306 --> 21:50.477
He had a noose around his neck
and was standing in burning kerosene.

21:50.561 --> 21:53.897
When the white man got close to him,
he kicked that barrel over,

21:53.981 --> 21:57.693
hung hisself, and set 'em on fire.

22:03.448 --> 22:04.700
And he--

22:06.243 --> 22:07.703
he passed that strength on to you.

22:13.166 --> 22:14.418
Can I ask you something, Satan?

22:14.501 --> 22:16.753
Yes, of course, Ptolemy.

22:24.887 --> 22:26.513
Could it be

22:27.097 --> 22:31.560
that once I got old and decrepit,

22:31.643 --> 22:35.022
I got so scared of what I knew

22:35.898 --> 22:37.608
that I just forgot it?

22:39.985 --> 22:42.029
All I can tell you is that

22:42.112 --> 22:45.574
if I knew all that you do,

22:46.909 --> 22:48.994
damn, if I wouldn't run like hell.

22:52.581 --> 22:54.124
Thank you for signing the paper.

22:56.877 --> 22:57.878
Thank you.

23:00.589 --> 23:01.673
All right.

23:20.943 --> 23:22.486
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:23.362 --> 23:24.821
So, what's the word?

23:25.322 --> 23:27.741
Everything's smooth
as a fat baby's ass.

23:27.824 --> 23:28.825
What?

23:34.081 --> 23:35.290
You sure you up for all this?

23:36.083 --> 23:37.584
He had you in there all morning.

23:37.668 --> 23:39.127
I thought you'd be worn down or something.

23:39.211 --> 23:41.421
I ain't got no time to be wore down.

23:41.922 --> 23:43.465
There's too much left to do.

23:44.007 --> 23:45.843
Besides, I'm looking forward to this.

23:45.926 --> 23:47.845
I ain't seen this man in over 20 years.

23:48.428 --> 23:49.888
Look how clean I got this one.

23:51.598 --> 23:52.599
Be careful now.

23:52.683 --> 23:54.852
You really never show Sensie one of these?

23:54.935 --> 23:57.396
- Not a one.
- Why?

23:58.647 --> 24:04.403
Sensia was one of the most beautiful,
pure souls I have ever known.

24:05.112 --> 24:08.115
She was also a woman of great appetites.

24:09.074 --> 24:12.661
If she'd know about that treasure,
wouldn't have been no stopping that woman.

24:12.744 --> 24:14.788
So you're saying she woulda stole it.

24:14.872 --> 24:18.542
Oh, no, no. She wouldn't spend it all
on herself. She'd spread it around.

24:19.042 --> 24:22.254
Friends, family, lovers.

24:23.463 --> 24:25.465
Wait. You mean like boyfriends?

24:26.216 --> 24:27.801
It ain't always have to be men.

24:27.885 --> 24:30.637
What? It was like that?

24:31.138 --> 24:32.681
And you just accepted it?

24:33.182 --> 24:35.475
I accepted her.

24:37.769 --> 24:38.896
So, what about you?

24:39.438 --> 24:41.273
You have any appetites?

24:43.650 --> 24:45.110
Slipped up one time.

24:45.194 --> 24:47.279
This friend of Sensia's named Lolly.

24:47.362 --> 24:50.490
- Like a revenge thing.
- Unexpected thing.

24:51.241 --> 24:55.412
Sensia was out of town for the weekend.
Lolly asked could she cook dinner for me.

24:55.495 --> 24:57.164
Took me to her place.

24:57.915 --> 25:01.793
Only happened the once.
But I hated myself for it.

25:02.920 --> 25:06.840
Sensia took one sniff of me, she knew.
Kicked me out.

25:07.674 --> 25:11.720
Hour later she come looking for me, saying
she'd die if we couldn't be together.

25:12.888 --> 25:16.683
I never looked at another woman again.
Ever.

25:17.935 --> 25:20.270
Did Sensie do the same for you?

25:31.198 --> 25:32.449
Wow.

25:33.283 --> 25:35.160
- It somethin', ain't it?
- Yeah.

25:35.244 --> 25:37.454
- Why you whisperin'?
- I don't know. It make me wanna whisper.

25:39.414 --> 25:43.377
Ptolemy. <i>Mashallah</i>.
My old friend, Ptolemy. How are you?

25:43.460 --> 25:45.462
Syed. How are you, my friend?

25:45.546 --> 25:47.881
Oh. God is good. <i>Alhamdulillah.</i>

25:48.882 --> 25:51.301
- And who is this?
- This is Robyn. She's been helping me out.

25:51.385 --> 25:52.386
- Robyn.
- Yes.

25:52.469 --> 25:53.470
- You like my antiques?
- Yes.

25:53.554 --> 25:57.057
This marble bust
is of the great Roman emperor, Hadrian.

25:57.140 --> 26:00.227
He wrote a poem a long time ago,
right before he died.

26:00.310 --> 26:01.645
My father knew it well.

26:02.271 --> 26:05.107
"Dear fleeting sweeting, little friend,

26:05.190 --> 26:07.943
My body's comrade and its ghost,

26:08.026 --> 26:11.321
What region now must be thy goal,

26:11.405 --> 26:14.283
Little numb and naked soul,

26:14.366 --> 26:17.578
Unable, as of old, to jest?"

26:18.412 --> 26:19.413
Wow.

26:19.496 --> 26:20.664
That's it.

26:21.290 --> 26:23.458
Look around, please.
Ask me anything you'd like.

26:23.542 --> 26:24.793
Thank you.

26:24.877 --> 26:26.545
How-- How-- How's the family?

26:27.129 --> 26:30.424
My sons are in college, and Fatima
will be taking over the store one day.

26:30.507 --> 26:31.592
And your father?

26:32.843 --> 26:35.804
My father died three Augusts ago.

26:36.513 --> 26:38.599
Jafar, such a good man.

26:38.682 --> 26:40.475
Yeah, he was.

26:42.102 --> 26:43.896
One of the rarest pieces I have.

26:44.438 --> 26:46.857
It was done centuries ago
in Central Africa.

26:47.441 --> 26:49.693
For years, experts refused to believe

26:49.776 --> 26:52.613
that Africans had the craft
to create such perfection.

26:53.113 --> 26:54.489
But obviously, they were very wrong.

26:54.573 --> 26:55.616
Obviously.

26:56.366 --> 26:59.161
Syed,
you still using that tearoom back there?

26:59.244 --> 27:00.954
Absolutely. Come on.

27:03.832 --> 27:05.834
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

27:05.918 --> 27:08.670
Robyn was asking how we actually met.

27:09.505 --> 27:10.506
I was 14.

27:10.589 --> 27:13.884
When I saw this Black man
walk through the store,

27:13.967 --> 27:17.721
I lingered, just to make sure
he wouldn't take anything.

27:18.305 --> 27:20.516
I was young and stupid.

27:20.599 --> 27:24.102
Ptolemy asked about the Celtic circlet
hammered from silver.

27:24.186 --> 27:26.939
I believe we were selling it for $700
at that time.

27:27.606 --> 27:30.484
I wanted to get
something pretty for Sensia.

27:30.567 --> 27:33.820
She had been sick
for a long time by then.

27:33.904 --> 27:39.201
And Jafar, his daddy,
asked me how much money I had.

27:39.284 --> 27:42.913
I told him $87.

27:43.413 --> 27:45.999
He said he'd take that as a down payment

27:46.083 --> 27:48.919
and I could pay him the rest
when I come back in a month later.

27:49.002 --> 27:51.463
- Wow.
- Put it in a pretty box.

27:51.547 --> 27:54.466
Wow, Sensia was so happy.

27:55.551 --> 27:57.553
When Mr. Grey left,
I asked my father

27:57.636 --> 28:00.222
why he trusted a Black man
that he had never met before.

28:00.305 --> 28:05.185
He told me, "You cannot tell a man
from his color, his clothes,

28:05.269 --> 28:07.312
nor his nationality, nor his God.

28:07.396 --> 28:10.107
You can only know a man
from what he has in his heart."

28:10.190 --> 28:12.818
That Jafar. He was a good man.

28:13.610 --> 28:17.739
I came by every month
till I paid him back.

28:18.407 --> 28:21.159
What are you doing here today,
my old friend? Just saying hello?

28:21.243 --> 28:22.911
Show him the coin, Robyn.

28:30.043 --> 28:32.254
- You're looking to sell this today?
- No, no, no.

28:32.337 --> 28:33.839
We just want a price right now.

28:34.631 --> 28:35.924
Give me one second.

28:40.762 --> 28:45.767
You know, Mr. Ptolemy brought
these coins in from time to time.

28:46.518 --> 28:48.520
That's why we got this index.

28:49.479 --> 28:50.564
Let's see.

28:58.572 --> 29:03.285
Saint-Gaudens double eagle.

29:03.368 --> 29:06.455
1932. Good condition.

29:06.538 --> 29:08.832
You're looking at 50,000.

29:09.958 --> 29:12.794
Wait, 50,000 for these?

29:12.878 --> 29:16.340
For each one. Yes.
That is a general estimate.

29:16.423 --> 29:18.133
Like my father always told Ptolemy,

29:18.800 --> 29:22.429
there are better dealers
for these type of artifacts. More profit.

29:22.930 --> 29:25.849
But then again,
Ptolemy never trusted them.

29:25.933 --> 29:27.559
Ain't nothing changed.

29:27.643 --> 29:29.770
'Preciate your help.
Yes, sir.

29:34.608 --> 29:36.068
What you lookin' at?

29:36.777 --> 29:39.363
I'm reading this book about astronomy.

29:39.446 --> 29:42.366
- That for your GED?
- Nah.

29:42.866 --> 29:47.037
Did you know that the sun takes up
more space than a million Earths?

29:47.120 --> 29:49.581
- Damn. That's big.
- Right?

29:49.665 --> 29:53.752
And in the old days, people used to think
that the sun was God.

29:53.836 --> 29:55.087
She probably still is.

29:56.630 --> 29:57.881
Yeah.

30:00.425 --> 30:02.052
What you over there brooding about?

30:02.135 --> 30:05.931
Everything I ever knew…
all at once.

30:07.182 --> 30:08.809
Yeah, that sound like a lot of work.

30:08.892 --> 30:10.269
Sure is.

30:10.936 --> 30:15.649
But I ain't got but a few more days
to get my affairs in order.

30:19.236 --> 30:21.864
It don't-- It don't bother you,

30:22.656 --> 30:26.577
thinking about how it's gonna go back
to the way it was?

30:31.206 --> 30:33.417
I done made my peace with it.

30:35.919 --> 30:37.296
Bother you?

30:37.880 --> 30:39.131
What you think?

30:44.344 --> 30:45.679
You know, my--

30:45.762 --> 30:49.975
my father used to run the streets
every night with thugs.

30:50.684 --> 30:54.104
And then one Saturday,
he just didn't come home.

30:55.898 --> 30:57.774
Me and my mama buried him.

30:58.775 --> 31:01.445
And then she got on the pipe,

31:02.946 --> 31:04.573
and I tried to help her.

31:05.282 --> 31:07.451
And she would promise me,

31:08.952 --> 31:11.705
almost every day,
that she would get clean.

31:11.788 --> 31:15.542
And then one Thursday morning,
I woke up and she was dead.

31:29.264 --> 31:30.390
Listen.

31:32.809 --> 31:34.394
Devil told me…

31:36.730 --> 31:41.109
that I would go back to the way I was.
Not die.

31:41.193 --> 31:43.028
He said it could be worse.

31:43.111 --> 31:47.783
If I ain't took his medicine,
we wouldn't be talking right now.

31:48.659 --> 31:50.327
You just don't understand me.

31:50.410 --> 31:51.620
Okay.

31:52.871 --> 31:56.750
Then make me understand.

31:57.584 --> 31:58.752
I was--

31:59.837 --> 32:03.841
I was happy when my mama died.

32:06.218 --> 32:10.264
I knew that she arranged it so that
I could stay at Auntie Niecie house.

32:12.641 --> 32:14.685
I hoped in my heart--

32:15.769 --> 32:18.730
I wish that I didn't,
but I hoped that she would pass,

32:18.814 --> 32:21.441
just so that I could
get out of that house.

32:23.902 --> 32:28.824
So… I'm the one
you should be calling "devil."

32:30.826 --> 32:32.369
No, no, child.

32:34.288 --> 32:37.040
You are not the devil.

32:37.124 --> 32:39.168
What I mean is…

32:40.460 --> 32:43.714
You're the first person
I was ever close to that I--

32:44.965 --> 32:47.092
that I didn't want to die.

32:47.593 --> 32:50.470
I just don't want you to go away.

32:53.557 --> 32:55.809
I don't want you to go away.

33:07.362 --> 33:09.198
I'll get it.

33:09.281 --> 33:10.616
No, I'ma come wit' you.

33:19.124 --> 33:20.167
Mr. Grey?

33:20.834 --> 33:21.835
Yes?

33:21.919 --> 33:23.587
My name is Darwin Andrews.

33:23.670 --> 33:24.922
I work for the city,

33:25.005 --> 33:30.135
making sure that our elder residents are
safe and capable of self-maintenance.

33:30.219 --> 33:32.471
Do you mind if I come in
and ask you a few questions?

33:33.388 --> 33:34.640
Yeah, sure. Come on.

33:35.599 --> 33:36.600
This way.

33:48.570 --> 33:52.199
So, why are you here?

33:53.158 --> 33:57.204
Your niece has made a claim
that Miss Robyn Barnet

33:57.287 --> 34:00.374
has been mistreating and abusing you
and your home.

34:01.750 --> 34:03.585
Has you been abusing me, Bird?

34:03.669 --> 34:05.337
No, Uncle, I have not.

34:06.046 --> 34:08.757
- Well…
- Do you see this, Mr. Grey?

34:13.011 --> 34:16.139
Your niece and her son

34:16.974 --> 34:20.768
claim that Miss Barnet
has stolen your money

34:20.853 --> 34:22.896
and is allowing you to live in squalor.

34:23.522 --> 34:25.065
There might be some dust here and there,

34:25.148 --> 34:26.608
but I wouldn't call it "squalor."

34:27.150 --> 34:28.777
Officer? Hey, hey!

34:28.860 --> 34:33.447
I don't remember giving you permission
to be rummaging through my house.

34:36.702 --> 34:39.329
I just showed you a piece of fruit,
Mr. Grey. What was it?

34:39.413 --> 34:43.792
A navel orange with a hint of green
up 'round where the stem was.

34:47.795 --> 34:51.091
What do you make of the claim about
this young woman taking your money?

34:52.426 --> 34:54.136
You live with somebody, Darwin?

34:54.219 --> 34:57.014
I'm asking the questions, Mr. Grey.

34:57.097 --> 34:59.850
Right. You licensed by the city.

35:00.893 --> 35:04.646
Now I asked you that question
'cause if you do live with somebody,

35:04.730 --> 35:08.150
and my niece said that somebody
was stealing your money,

35:08.233 --> 35:10.402
how would I know if that was true or not?

35:11.111 --> 35:12.112
Why would she lie?

35:12.196 --> 35:13.530
Why would I lie?

35:13.614 --> 35:16.241
For that matter, why would Robyn lie?

35:16.950 --> 35:20.120
Your niece is just trying to safeguard
your money and your property.

35:20.204 --> 35:22.247
And if you deem me incompetent,

35:22.331 --> 35:26.835
then my niece is the one who will end up
with my property and my money.

35:26.919 --> 35:28.003
Ain't that right?

35:29.671 --> 35:31.924
Do you mind if I take a look
around your apartment, sir?

35:32.007 --> 35:33.759
Oh, no. Be my guest.

35:33.842 --> 35:36.053
Robyn, give him the grand tour.

35:46.230 --> 35:48.565
- And what's your name, son?
- Regent.

35:49.274 --> 35:50.984
My name's Ptolemy.

35:51.068 --> 35:52.903
That means "king." Regent means "king."

35:52.986 --> 35:54.821
Ain't-- Ain't that something?

35:58.367 --> 36:03.080
So, Regent, you and your partner here,
this y'all's neighborhood?

36:03.163 --> 36:04.706
This y'all's beat?

36:04.790 --> 36:07.876
Yes, it is. Work out of 13th Precinct.

36:09.545 --> 36:13.632
You know anything about a killing
happened up around Delmar Circle?

36:13.715 --> 36:15.634
Yeah, he was killed about two weeks ago.

36:15.717 --> 36:21.014
Well, young man was my great-nephew,
Reggie Lloyd.

36:21.098 --> 36:22.307
Sorry to hear that.

36:23.016 --> 36:24.560
How's the investigation coming?

36:24.643 --> 36:25.686
It's above our pay grade.

36:25.769 --> 36:28.146
Detectives are working the case, sir.

36:28.230 --> 36:31.692
They don't tell us anything unless there's
somebody to be brought in for questioning.

36:31.775 --> 36:33.318
Has anybody been brought in?

36:43.161 --> 36:44.746
Have you had this house cleaned recently?

36:44.830 --> 36:47.124
Has your house been cleaned recently?

36:48.625 --> 36:50.878
I'll be filing
a report with social services.

36:50.961 --> 36:55.841
They'll drop by from time to time
to check on you and Miss Barnet.

36:55.924 --> 36:58.010
That's mighty white of you, Darwin.

37:00.387 --> 37:01.388
Let's go.

37:01.471 --> 37:02.639
Y'all have a good day now.

37:03.765 --> 37:04.808
Thank you.

37:17.237 --> 37:18.238
Fried thighs are coming.

37:18.322 --> 37:19.489
Oh, well, thank you, Sonia.

37:19.573 --> 37:22.576
You got to eat good if you wanna be out
here in these modern-day cotton fields.

37:22.659 --> 37:25.787
I hear you. Might've been easier
down-home than up here.

37:25.871 --> 37:29.166
Hal Drucker got shot walking
to his car last night. Just walking.

37:29.249 --> 37:30.709
Now he's dead as a doornail.

37:30.792 --> 37:33.170
Wait, that's the man
that wear the red suit all the time.

37:34.838 --> 37:36.423
You looking good, Miss Robyn.

37:36.507 --> 37:38.717
Got them boys chasing her ass double time.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.052
Oh, whatever.

37:40.135 --> 37:41.261
- Please.
- I'll go get your food.

37:41.345 --> 37:42.346
All right.

37:43.639 --> 37:44.890
Now, about Niecie.

37:45.557 --> 37:48.769
I know what's in Niecie's heart.

37:48.852 --> 37:52.189
But Niecie would take everything I got

37:52.272 --> 37:55.359
and turn around,
think she doing right by me.

37:55.859 --> 37:57.444
Did you ever think that way about me?

37:57.528 --> 38:00.030
No. That thought never crossed my mind.

38:00.113 --> 38:01.615
Not even when I took the comb?

38:03.534 --> 38:05.285
Young girl see something that beautiful

38:05.369 --> 38:07.621
and don't want to touch it,
that'd be a crime.

38:07.704 --> 38:10.415
Yeah, but I didn't just touch it.
I put it in my pockets.

38:10.499 --> 38:14.920
Robyn,
you ain't got a crooked bone in your body.

38:15.003 --> 38:17.589
- How do you know that?
- I just know.

38:17.673 --> 38:20.425
All your life you wanted so hard,

38:20.509 --> 38:23.303
you worried you're gonna take
something ain't yours.

38:23.387 --> 38:26.181
And Niecie, she don't even know to worry.

38:26.265 --> 38:28.559
Why? Because she just want so bad?

38:28.642 --> 38:31.979
Some Black folk,
and some white folk too,

38:32.062 --> 38:35.566
want things so bad,
they just can't help theirself.

38:35.649 --> 38:37.734
But that don't make them bad people.

38:37.818 --> 38:41.655
- What? So what it make them then?
- Trapped.

38:41.738 --> 38:43.323
They caught in the quicksand,

38:43.407 --> 38:44.867
and we need to help 'em out.

38:44.950 --> 38:47.536
So we supposed to love these motherfuckers
even when they don't deserve it?

38:47.619 --> 38:50.163
Oh, nah, now.
I ain't-- I ain't say all that.

38:51.456 --> 38:53.500
Okay. So what if I told you
there was more shit with Hilly?

38:53.584 --> 38:54.877
Like what?

38:54.960 --> 38:57.254
Like, Auntie Niecie gave Hilly money

38:57.337 --> 38:59.965
to give to Reggie and Roger
for the work they'd done,

39:00.048 --> 39:02.551
but Hilly never gave it to Reggie.

39:02.634 --> 39:06.388
- So, Hilly stole Reggie's money?
- Yeah.

39:14.188 --> 39:15.647
You see them?

39:15.731 --> 39:18.108
Artie! Artie!

39:21.028 --> 39:23.113
Latisha.
What y'all doing in the damn street?

39:23.197 --> 39:24.489
We're drawing.

39:24.573 --> 39:26.366
Why you wanna draw
in the middle of the street for?

39:26.450 --> 39:28.160
- Come on.
- Is y'all mama wit' y'all?

39:28.243 --> 39:29.369
- She too sad.
- No.

39:29.453 --> 39:30.579
So you all staying here?

39:30.662 --> 39:32.456
Just till she happy again.

39:33.081 --> 39:35.584
Lord have mercy.
You bring them in the house, would you?

39:35.667 --> 39:37.586
- Come sit on the step.
- No.

39:37.669 --> 39:39.671
- I gotta talk to you. Yeah.
- No.

39:39.755 --> 39:40.881
Sit.

39:40.964 --> 39:42.799
What is wrong with you?
You know better than that.

39:42.883 --> 39:44.218
We was just drawing.

39:44.301 --> 39:46.094
You were drawing
up the street like that?

39:46.178 --> 39:47.721
- Yeah.
- No, it's not funny.

39:47.804 --> 39:51.016
It's not funny. I'm not playing
with y'all. You know better than that.

39:54.353 --> 39:56.563
What the hell is all that noise?

39:57.856 --> 39:58.690
Well?

39:59.816 --> 40:01.193
Well, is you gonna let me in?

40:01.276 --> 40:03.320
I thought social services took you.

40:03.403 --> 40:05.239
Who's that at the door, Hilliard?

40:05.322 --> 40:07.616
Niecie! Tell this fool to let me in.

40:07.699 --> 40:11.787
Pitypapa. Wha-- Come in. Come inside.

40:14.039 --> 40:15.332
Hi, Auntie Niecie.

40:24.550 --> 40:26.301
That a new outfit you got?

40:26.385 --> 40:28.762
Maybe we should tell social services
about that.

40:28.846 --> 40:31.348
Maybe I should've cut your shit off
when I had the chance.

40:31.932 --> 40:35.102
Did you know them children
was out there, playing in the street?

40:35.185 --> 40:37.104
Hilly, were the kids outside alone?

40:37.187 --> 40:39.273
I told 'em to stay out the street.

40:39.356 --> 40:41.400
Go get your uncle some ice water.

40:46.071 --> 40:48.115
How come you got Reggie's kids over here?

40:49.658 --> 40:51.702
You seem different.

40:51.785 --> 40:54.746
Why you got Reggie's children?

40:55.455 --> 40:58.333
Nina wanted to get her mind together.
She asked me to take 'em.

40:58.417 --> 41:00.377
She sent them over here
to stay with us.

41:00.460 --> 41:02.129
And how much she paying you for that?

41:03.797 --> 41:07.426
Reggie saved up a little bit of money.
She only gave me enough to feed them.

41:07.509 --> 41:09.261
Police call you when Reggie got killed?

41:09.344 --> 41:10.345
They called Nina.

41:10.429 --> 41:12.431
She was so scared,
she asked me to go with.

41:12.514 --> 41:14.141
And what they tell you?

41:14.683 --> 41:16.143
That somebody had shot him in the head.

41:19.396 --> 41:20.647
What you got to say, boy?

41:20.731 --> 41:22.024
I ain't no boy.

41:24.568 --> 41:25.569
Listen here.

41:26.570 --> 41:29.656
I went down to the bank,
and I opened up a checking account

41:29.740 --> 41:35.120
for you, the boy, Reggie's wife
and kids and a few other folk.

41:35.204 --> 41:40.042
And I made Robyn here the…
What you call that?

41:40.125 --> 41:42.377
- A signatory.
- Signatory.

41:42.461 --> 41:46.840
So, she gonna be writing you a check
for $900, once a month.

41:46.924 --> 41:48.217
- Robyn?
- Yeah.

41:48.300 --> 41:50.802
It's enough for you to pay
your little bills and stuff around here.

41:50.886 --> 41:53.388
- Something left over for you.
- Why don't you let me write my own checks?

41:53.472 --> 41:56.016
'Cause you tried to get me
dragged out my own house

41:56.099 --> 41:57.476
and locked up in the old folk's prison.

41:57.559 --> 41:59.186
Uncle, I was trying to help.

41:59.269 --> 42:02.606
Hilly said that you were crazy.
He said you were living in filth.

42:02.689 --> 42:05.025
- He tell you he stole my money?
- I ain't steal from you.

42:05.108 --> 42:08.654
I gave Shirley Wring $50, and I know that

42:08.737 --> 42:10.489
'cause she come by my house
and paid it back to me.

42:10.572 --> 42:13.659
- You stole half the rest of it.
- You calling me a thief?

42:13.742 --> 42:15.077
- To your face.
- Sit down!

42:15.953 --> 42:16.954
Sit down.

42:20.123 --> 42:22.584
Robyn gonna call you in about a week.

42:22.668 --> 42:25.587
If you want the money, just say so.
If not…

42:26.839 --> 42:28.549
She's not even blood to us.

42:28.632 --> 42:31.760
I just don't think it's right to have
some stranger doing our family business.

42:31.844 --> 42:33.387
So, I'm a stranger?

42:34.054 --> 42:35.389
I cleaned your house, made your meals.

42:35.472 --> 42:37.808
I do more for you than Hilly ever did.
You gonna call me a stranger?

42:37.891 --> 42:39.476
Why don't you take these children

42:39.560 --> 42:42.062
down to the store
and get 'em something sweet?

42:46.358 --> 42:47.860
Come on.

42:47.943 --> 42:49.945
- Come on, let's go. We going to the store.
- Okay.

42:53.073 --> 42:54.658
- Boy.
- What?

42:54.741 --> 42:57.578
Why don't you meet me out here
on the porch? Let me rap with you.

43:10.966 --> 43:13.677
So, Hilly, d'you do it?

43:19.016 --> 43:20.142
Yeah.

43:21.226 --> 43:22.936
But I ain't--
I ain't think you was gonna know it.

43:23.020 --> 43:25.439
Like, I wouldn't have stole your money
if I knew you could count.

43:26.064 --> 43:27.858
- Hilliard.
- Yeah?

43:27.941 --> 43:31.236
Do you really think
it's okay to steal from somebody

43:31.320 --> 43:33.572
just 'cause they don't know you doing it?

43:34.198 --> 43:36.033
I mean, yeah.

43:36.867 --> 43:38.160
I mean, what difference it make?

43:38.243 --> 43:41.079
If they don't know it,
then it don't hurt 'em.

43:43.582 --> 43:45.042
Jesus Christ.

43:45.542 --> 43:48.629
What? Sorry I took the money again.

43:55.636 --> 43:57.554
I'm sorry about Hilly, Uncle.

43:59.181 --> 44:02.434
He just never had a man
to teach him right from wrong. I--

44:03.268 --> 44:06.230
Yeah. I could've been that man.

44:08.065 --> 44:09.858
You had enough on your plate back then.

44:09.942 --> 44:12.945
Well,
I still should've been here for the boy.

44:13.570 --> 44:15.322
Should've been here for all y'all.

44:19.284 --> 44:23.539
Look here, if I gave you some money,

44:23.622 --> 44:26.333
you think you could pull together
a little gathering?

44:27.125 --> 44:30.087
You know,
maybe the folks who was at the repass.

44:30.170 --> 44:32.130
- Get 'em to come back?
- What for?

44:32.756 --> 44:34.258
I just want to say a few words.

44:35.092 --> 44:36.301
Well, I don't know, Uncle.

44:36.385 --> 44:40.806
I don't know who's around
or would even want to.

44:41.306 --> 44:45.227
- Could you try?
- Okay. I'll try.

44:49.022 --> 44:50.315
Car be here soon.

44:50.399 --> 44:51.775
- You ready to go?
- Sure.

44:53.360 --> 44:54.486
I'ma call you.

45:07.416 --> 45:08.584
What's this here?

45:09.168 --> 45:12.254
<i>Forbes</i>. It's a magazine
about millionaires and billionaires.

45:12.337 --> 45:15.757
Yeah, I know what <i>Forbes </i>is.
I mean, what you doing with it?

45:15.841 --> 45:18.218
There's an article on e-sports.

45:19.678 --> 45:20.679
Here?

45:22.222 --> 45:23.265
What's that?

45:23.348 --> 45:25.934
Competitive gaming.
You know, video gaming.

45:26.018 --> 45:28.645
- I thought you designed games.
- To pay my rent.

45:28.729 --> 45:30.981
But there's more money in playing
than designing.

45:31.064 --> 45:33.066
You can make money
sitting around playing games?

45:33.150 --> 45:36.653
The last <i>League of Legends</i> competition
had more viewers than a Super Bowl.

45:37.362 --> 45:41.533
<i>Forbes</i> says that last year,
ten gamers made more than ten million.

45:41.617 --> 45:42.618
Dollars?

45:42.701 --> 45:44.953
Mostly endorsements, but yes, sir.

45:45.037 --> 45:46.663
I'll be damned.

45:46.747 --> 45:48.457
Ain't that somethin'.

45:51.877 --> 45:52.878
There she is.

45:54.713 --> 45:56.381
You really like her, huh?

45:56.465 --> 46:00.344
Yes, sir.
I like how tough she is. Pretty too.

46:00.427 --> 46:04.306
Well, you know she been hurt by folks
supposed to love her before?

46:04.389 --> 46:05.641
I know.

46:14.358 --> 46:15.526
I'm getting my GED.

46:17.444 --> 46:18.445
You graduated?

46:18.529 --> 46:20.322
- Yeah, I passed.
- All right. Congratulations.

46:20.405 --> 46:23.200
- Oh, no surprise there.
- You know, we should go celebrate.

46:23.867 --> 46:26.912
I need to go see Billy first.
I promised him.

46:26.995 --> 46:28.539
Okay, well, after then?

46:28.622 --> 46:30.207
Anywhere you wanna go.

46:58.652 --> 47:01.697
- Billy. Billy!
- Mr. Grey.

47:03.073 --> 47:04.074
What you doing over here?

47:05.117 --> 47:06.702
I wanted to talk to you.

47:06.785 --> 47:08.120
About what?

47:10.747 --> 47:12.124
Can I buy you a drink?

47:12.207 --> 47:13.500
All right.

47:13.584 --> 47:16.336
Niko, would you grab us
a couple of beers from the back?

47:23.260 --> 47:24.887
So, who dropped you off, man?

47:25.846 --> 47:28.682
Roger Dawes.
You know, he going out with Robyn now.

47:29.308 --> 47:31.852
Roger. He used to work for Reggie
from time to time.

47:32.769 --> 47:33.979
He's a good kid.

47:34.062 --> 47:36.481
Yeah. I mean, she could do worse.

47:39.276 --> 47:43.488
You know,
I talked to the police about Reggie.

47:45.032 --> 47:49.244
They could give a damn about a Black man
getting shot down in the streets.

47:49.745 --> 47:53.081
Even if they know that Black man
didn't run the streets.

47:53.165 --> 47:55.626
You don't have to run the streets
to get killed in 'em.

47:55.709 --> 47:56.793
Don't I know it.

47:59.713 --> 48:00.797
But…

48:02.257 --> 48:05.969
- But what?
- Reggie told me before he got killed,

48:06.595 --> 48:08.889
he was thinking
he was gonna have to leave town.

48:09.556 --> 48:10.557
So?

48:10.641 --> 48:14.144
So, I wanna know who killed my nephew.

48:17.439 --> 48:18.607
What for?

48:19.858 --> 48:22.736
What would you do if somebody
killed one of your loved ones?

48:33.247 --> 48:36.583
One day, Reggie told me about--

48:37.251 --> 48:38.669
Something about Nina's ex-boyfriend.

48:38.752 --> 48:41.296
- The one just got out of prison?
- So, he already talked to you about this?

48:41.380 --> 48:44.675
He told me some,
but, you know, not-- not-- not a lot.

48:44.758 --> 48:45.843
He ain't had no name.

48:45.926 --> 48:48.428
Nah, nah, Reggie--
Reggie didn't say a name.

48:50.430 --> 48:52.808
But he did say that the cat
was sentenced to 20 years

48:52.891 --> 48:55.060
and got out in 12.

48:56.311 --> 48:58.272
Interesting.

49:06.238 --> 49:07.865
What you about to do, Mr. Grey?

49:13.662 --> 49:16.373
I'm about to kill me a motherfucker,
Billy.

49:17.833 --> 49:19.877
That's what I'm about to do.
