00:19.958 --> 00:21.125
Dadda's gonna miss you.

00:22.916 --> 00:25.166
Well, she could always stay.

00:25.250 --> 00:26.250
Yeah! I wish.

00:27.541 --> 00:29.375
What have you got planned anyway?

00:29.458 --> 00:32.040
Well, I'm gonna go check out
the footy this arvo with Pete

00:32.125 --> 00:33.916
and then catch up on some sleep.

00:38.833 --> 00:42.125
Actually, maybe she could stay.
Maybe that's better.

00:43.208 --> 00:44.208
No.

00:44.291 --> 00:46.416
No, I think, you know, it's good for Lois
to meet her great-granddaughter.

00:46.500 --> 00:47.500
Isn't it?

00:47.583 --> 00:49.291
-Well, we'll just be cleaning all weekend.

00:49.375 --> 00:50.875
-Pretty much.

00:50.958 --> 00:52.083
Last year I spent a whole day
doing the windows

00:52.166 --> 00:54.916
with just one bucket of cold water
and a capful of vinegar.

00:56.041 --> 00:58.166
Think about the dust.
She might have your allergies.

00:58.250 --> 00:59.750
No, no, no - she's got
no problem with dust.

00:59.833 --> 01:00.750
Well, we don't know.

01:00.833 --> 01:02.416
It's more about her getting
the good country air, isn't it?

01:02.500 --> 01:03.583
Into those little lungs.

01:03.666 --> 01:05.625
We'll be inside cleaning
the whole time.

01:05.708 --> 01:08.541
Well, I'm really happy for her
to stay here with me

01:08.625 --> 01:11.833
but I think Lois is getting older
and, you know,

01:11.916 --> 01:14.250
God forbid if she was to die
and then Stevie hasn't met her.

01:14.333 --> 01:17.833
I doubt that. We've got good genes.
Aunty Irene died at 107.

01:17.916 --> 01:19.958
-Oh, yeah.
-We've got plenty of time.

01:21.500 --> 01:22.916
She can stay.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.583
Probably don't really have enough food
here, though.

01:24.666 --> 01:26.583
-We have breast milk in the freezer.

01:26.666 --> 01:30.458
Yep, and I've just fed her.
How many would you need

01:31.291 --> 01:32.791
So, it's probably not enough, is it?

01:32.875 --> 01:34.958
...8, 9, 10. You'll be fine!

01:35.041 --> 01:37.333
-This'll be good for you two.
-Yeah.

01:37.416 --> 01:38.500
That makes sense. Yep?

01:39.791 --> 01:41.416
Yeah.

01:41.500 --> 01:42.250
OK.

01:42.333 --> 01:43.875
It'll be great, won't it?

01:43.958 --> 01:47.083
So long as you're not just fleeing
'cause you're still mad at me.

01:47.166 --> 01:50.500
If I were fleeing, I'd be fleeing
to a very expensive boutique hotel.

01:50.583 --> 01:54.625
I wouldn't be driving five hours to clean
my grandmother's putrid cottage, would I?

01:54.708 --> 01:55.791
Just don't baptise her.

01:55.875 --> 01:57.791
Yeah. Don't go to mass
with any strange men.

01:59.916 --> 02:01.791
Well, have fun, you two.

02:01.875 --> 02:03.083
Oh, we will.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.916
Mumma's gonna miss you!

02:08.333 --> 02:09.791
Where's my pump?

02:09.875 --> 02:12.583
OK, bye. Love you. Drive safe.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.750
How the fuck did that just happen?

02:27.708 --> 02:29.916
Thanks for paying, darling.
-That's all right.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.583
I don't know why you
don't just tap and go. So much easier.

02:32.666 --> 02:35.208
Yeah, I do.
Just not as often as you, clearly.

02:35.291 --> 02:36.833
Anyway, this weekend will be fun.

02:36.916 --> 02:38.708
Proper catch-up, just the two of us.

02:38.791 --> 02:40.791
Well, your mum will be there.
Are we just going to ignore her?

02:40.875 --> 02:42.416
Apparently she has news.

02:43.208 --> 02:44.500
She's not sick, is she?

02:44.583 --> 02:46.208
Oh, God. She'll be annoyed
I didn't bring Stevie.

02:46.291 --> 02:49.458
No, she won't. She hates babies.
Prefers foals.

02:49.541 --> 02:51.375
Oh, I'll just catch up on sleep.

02:51.458 --> 02:54.416
Only had three hours last night.
Might nap in the car.

02:54.500 --> 02:58.750
No - no, you're driving.
I need to study.

03:19.500 --> 03:26.166
Hey, Mum, I'm... I'm actually pleased
we're going away. I, uh, oh...

03:26.250 --> 03:30.333
I did, um, a really stupid thing
the other day.

03:31.125 --> 03:32.125
Even for me.

03:32.208 --> 03:34.958
You know the dad in my mother's group?

03:36.416 --> 03:37.458
Mum?

03:38.458 --> 03:39.750
Mum?

03:39.833 --> 03:41.041
Mum?

03:41.125 --> 03:43.791
Oh, what... What?

03:43.875 --> 03:46.333
Audrey, I'm reading, darling.

03:46.416 --> 03:47.416
Reading.

03:48.416 --> 03:49.666
You'll make a great therapist, Mum.

03:49.750 --> 03:52.916
Thanks. Thanks, darling.

04:07.458 --> 04:08.708
<i> Hi!</i>

04:08.791 --> 04:09.916
<i>Oh, hi. You OK?</i>

04:10.000 --> 04:13.083
Yep. We are having a great time together.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.208
<i>Pretty sure she just said...</i>

04:16.291 --> 04:17.625
Jeremy?

04:18.875 --> 04:20.833
Jeremy, are you there

04:20.916 --> 04:23.583
I'm just having a bit of trouble
getting her to, uh, take the bottle.

04:23.666 --> 04:26.208
Jeremy, are you there Aud Audrey?

04:30.583 --> 04:33.208
Oh, there's no reception. Shit!

04:36.625 --> 04:38.458
-Thank you so much.
-Don't worry about it.

04:38.541 --> 04:42.458
It happens all the time.
We're not made for multitasking.

04:42.541 --> 04:43.541
No. Hello?

04:54.000 --> 04:59.291
Mum? Oh, lord, that smell!

04:59.375 --> 05:00.791
Get used to it.

05:00.875 --> 05:01.875
Lois, we're here.

05:02.708 --> 05:03.750
Mum?

05:04.541 --> 05:06.375
Oh. I'll make tea.

05:06.458 --> 05:08.875
Oh, yeah. Check if she's made a slice.

05:19.083 --> 05:20.541
Huh.

05:21.791 --> 05:23.541
God, remember how many times
you made me watch this

05:23.625 --> 05:24.666
when I was, what

05:24.750 --> 05:26.958
<i>-Kramer vs Kramer.</i>

05:27.041 --> 05:30.375
Oh. Yeah, it was when we were
thinking of getting a divorce.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.416
Divorce? Huh.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.708
And was <i> Tootsie</i> because
Dad was secretly cross

05:36.791 --> 05:39.875
Oh, that's funny. You know, he did
used to like putting on all of my...

05:39.958 --> 05:41.541
Stop. Don't do... no.

05:43.833 --> 05:46.166
Oh, can you make sure she hasn't
died in her sleep?

05:47.041 --> 05:48.458
Yep, alright.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.166
Hi!

05:53.250 --> 05:54.250
Where's the baby?

05:55.250 --> 05:56.458
She didn't bring it.

06:01.625 --> 06:05.291
Oh, she's a stunner, sweetheart.
Make the picture bigger.

06:05.375 --> 06:06.875
Yeah, she's a real mix, isn't she?

06:06.958 --> 06:09.625
-Yeah.
-I think that's Dad's nose.

06:09.708 --> 06:11.083
Obviously my cheeks

06:11.166 --> 06:14.791
and maybe Jeremy's jawline,
or maybe that's Mum.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.250
Oh, she's nothing like your mother.

06:17.333 --> 06:20.291
Oh, now, there was an ugly baby.

06:20.375 --> 06:23.708
Oh, this thick mop of hair,
practically hirsute.

06:23.791 --> 06:27.791
The neighbours thought we had
a new puppy. And big features.

06:27.875 --> 06:29.958
Oh, it took her years
to grow into them.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.583
And when she did, as we all know,

06:31.666 --> 06:34.625
she grew very fond
of her appearance.

06:34.708 --> 06:36.250
Oh, that's lovely, that is.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.416
You'll have some more, pet?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.916
Oh, you've got to try for a boy!

06:42.000 --> 06:43.708
They're much easier.

06:43.791 --> 06:45.125
Is there anywhere
I can get reception?

06:45.208 --> 06:46.416
I really should call them.

06:46.500 --> 06:47.958
Yeah, up the back.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.958
If you go up the bridal path,
past the Hamiltons' place

06:51.041 --> 06:53.916
and you'll get a signal
when you get up to the top.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.083
You know where I caught you
rolling around with Mack?

06:56.166 --> 06:58.541
When she was a teenager?

06:58.625 --> 07:00.750
No, last spring, wasn't it?

07:00.833 --> 07:02.916
I'll take you up there
tomorrow morning.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.750
Well, can we go now?

07:04.833 --> 07:06.666
Oh, darling, just give them a night!

07:06.750 --> 07:08.541
Right. I've cleaned out the shed

07:08.625 --> 07:11.625
and there's a pile of stuff out
there on the patio for the tip.

07:11.708 --> 07:13.250
Unless you want some of it.

07:13.333 --> 07:14.750
Well, are there my paintings?

07:17.458 --> 07:19.666
OK. Well, I'll get started on the dusting.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.208
Why is she clearing out the shed?

07:21.291 --> 07:23.958
You don't think she's
preparing for death?

07:24.041 --> 07:26.000
Oh, I don't think she's that considerate.

07:26.083 --> 07:28.875
Oh, God! Flies.

07:28.958 --> 07:30.708
I hate the country.

07:30.791 --> 07:33.583
Oh, I hope they're OK.
But not too OK.

07:33.666 --> 07:37.458
It would be good for Jeremy
to experience the real hell of it.

07:37.541 --> 07:40.791
-Thank you.

07:40.875 --> 07:43.458
-Cheers.
-Cheers, mate.

07:43.541 --> 07:45.250
-Yeah.

07:46.208 --> 07:47.250
-Oh.
-Ooh!

07:47.333 --> 07:49.000
Can you imagine tackling Leilua?

07:49.083 --> 07:50.666
It'd be like trying to tackle a horse.

07:50.750 --> 07:52.416
Yeah, like, a working horse.
Like a Clydesdale.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.041
Like a Clydesdale that's on steroids,

07:54.125 --> 07:56.583
that's being ridden by
another Clydesdale.

07:56.666 --> 07:58.541
As a jockey.

08:00.375 --> 08:01.500
Oh.

08:02.833 --> 08:04.041
Oh. Oh.

08:04.125 --> 08:06.291
It's not that bad, is it?

08:07.208 --> 08:08.458
I'll change it at half-time.

08:08.541 --> 08:10.208
Mate, you are immune.

08:10.291 --> 08:12.458
Mate, your baby stinks.
Change its nappy.

08:12.541 --> 08:13.958
Alright, mate,
mind your own business.

08:14.041 --> 08:16.791
He's right. It stinks.

08:17.625 --> 08:23.250
Hello! Hello!

08:23.333 --> 08:26.666
I just need to change
my daughter's nappy.

08:26.750 --> 08:30.708
It's a man, by the way.

08:32.125 --> 08:33.166
Here we go.

08:33.250 --> 08:36.375
Whoop.
How are we looking?

08:36.457 --> 08:37.707
Whoa!

08:39.707 --> 08:42.250
Yeah, I need you to pop round the corner
and just get us, um, some nappies.

08:42.332 --> 08:45.166
No, not at half-time. Like, now.
Alright. After the kick.

08:45.250 --> 08:47.666
Oh he's missed it!
He's having a shocker!

08:47.750 --> 08:49.541
He's on my fantasy team.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.750
Oh.

09:05.833 --> 09:10.583
Oh, come on! Oh, good God!

09:13.875 --> 09:15.291
Come on

09:15.375 --> 09:17.833
I've inhaled so much bleach,
I just had a nosebleed.

09:19.041 --> 09:20.125
Is that you?

09:20.208 --> 09:22.000
Yeah - it's an old-school selfie.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.750
Ha. Are these all yours?

09:23.833 --> 09:26.958
Yeah. Look at the legs on this one.

09:28.750 --> 09:31.125
-Oh, gosh, I can't remember.

09:31.208 --> 09:33.291
Handsome, though. Look at that jaw.

09:33.375 --> 09:34.916
He looks half your age.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.833
Come on, I thought we were going
to knock this over this arvo.

09:36.916 --> 09:39.166
Yeah, in a sec.
Have you stripped the beds?

09:39.250 --> 09:40.291
No, she said they're clean.

09:40.375 --> 09:43.250
Oh, well, by 'clean' she means
she's dusted them with baby powder.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.250
Well, that would explain my leaking.

09:45.333 --> 09:48.625
Oh, I remember! It's Alan Finch.

09:48.708 --> 09:51.250
He wrote me letter after letter
till his wife found out.

09:51.333 --> 09:53.416
Oh, charming.

09:53.500 --> 09:56.208
-No, not really.

09:56.291 --> 09:58.583
Oh, Audrey, go on!
Just read that bit there. Just that bit.

09:58.666 --> 10:01.125
-There. That bit. Read it.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.458
-Oh, wow.

10:03.541 --> 10:05.625
Go and ask her majesty if she wants us
to clean out the pantry.

10:05.708 --> 10:08.166
Yeah, I think we should.
I just found Vegemite from the '80s.

10:08.250 --> 10:10.083
That's last century!

10:13.791 --> 10:15.916
Here you go, sweetie.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.750
Yeah... except they're boy ones.
They're boy toddler nappies.

10:19.833 --> 10:21.500
What's the difference?

10:21.583 --> 10:22.666
OK, fuck. Serious?

10:22.750 --> 10:26.125
So, um, vaginas -
bit different to penises, OK?

10:26.208 --> 10:29.833
So, one shoots out like that and the
other one shoots down like that, OK?

10:29.916 --> 10:33.708
So, they absorb in different places.
Front for boys, middle for girls.

10:33.791 --> 10:36.125
But the bottoms are the same,
right, because they're both...

10:36.208 --> 10:38.625
Yeah, the bottoms are both at the back!

10:38.708 --> 10:39.708
It's OK, Stevie.

10:39.791 --> 10:42.166
No, no, no.
They're also for toddlers.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.416
Oh, mate, can you pick that up?

10:51.041 --> 10:52.375
Run.

10:53.625 --> 10:55.458
I did call out
and there was no response.

10:55.541 --> 10:57.833
Is that true, darling?
Did he call out to you?

10:57.916 --> 10:59.000
-No.
-Liar!

10:59.083 --> 11:00.541
Excuse me?

11:00.625 --> 11:02.416
Look, so, if we'd have known
anyone was in there

11:02.500 --> 11:04.250
we definitely wouldn't have gone inside.

11:04.333 --> 11:05.958
She also said you were
talking about your... penises!

11:06.041 --> 11:09.333
Liar! Oh, no, that's true, 'cause...

11:09.416 --> 11:11.791
It was just 'cause
I bought the wrong nappies.

11:11.875 --> 11:16.291
Um, because I bought the boys' ones
but the vagina sits...

11:16.375 --> 11:18.166
-I'm so sorry.
-It's supposed to be a safe zone.

11:18.250 --> 11:22.958
It is and the thing is
there's no change tables in the gents'.

11:23.041 --> 11:24.833
Sexist.

11:25.708 --> 11:26.791
Do you want a lollypop?

11:26.875 --> 11:28.750
-Don't.
-Absolutely not!

11:28.833 --> 11:30.916
That kid was a liar.

11:37.833 --> 11:44.291
Oh. Hello, boy. Have you seen Lois?

11:45.291 --> 11:47.125
Oh, it's nice to see you.

11:47.208 --> 11:49.333
Come on, let's go for a trot.

11:50.375 --> 11:53.000
Whoa. Come on. Come on!

11:53.083 --> 11:54.708
It's Audrey. What are you...?

11:55.375 --> 11:56.375
What?

11:56.458 --> 12:00.291
You're being hostile.
You've forgotten how to talk to him.

12:00.375 --> 12:02.916
Uh, not being hostile.
Just standing here. He's the hostile one.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.083
He's very perceptive.
You must have a blockage.

12:06.166 --> 12:07.791
I'm certified, you know.

12:07.875 --> 12:10.583
-Equine therapy.

12:10.666 --> 12:16.416
What? What are you,
a psychiatrist for horses?

12:16.500 --> 12:17.916
Do you have a couch?

12:18.000 --> 12:20.750
We're the patients. Not them.
I'll give you a session tomorrow.

12:20.833 --> 12:22.666
What's your mother doing?

12:22.750 --> 12:25.458
Reading love letters.
God, she was prolific.

12:25.541 --> 12:27.875
Prolific with men. Come on, it's teatime.

12:27.958 --> 12:32.000
Didn't we just have a pot?
Oh, you mean dinner.

12:32.083 --> 12:33.541
All right.

12:37.041 --> 12:38.375
You've changed.

12:42.541 --> 12:44.916
Oh, take those off!

12:47.541 --> 12:49.458
Oh, damn it.

12:49.541 --> 12:51.041
Bugger, bugger, bugger! Forgot the wine.

12:51.125 --> 12:52.958
It won't hurt you to go without
one night.

12:53.041 --> 12:54.416
Is there any cooking sherry?

12:54.500 --> 12:56.333
I just tipped that down the sink.

12:56.416 --> 12:57.750
Oh, Audrey! Damn it!

12:57.833 --> 13:00.208
There was a whole microcosm
living inside it.

13:00.291 --> 13:02.458
So?

13:03.458 --> 13:06.041
Oh, the Limoge!
Gee, I love this china.

13:06.125 --> 13:07.375
-Well, take it.

13:07.458 --> 13:08.958
Take anything you want.
You might as well.

13:09.041 --> 13:10.750
Save your tears.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.458
That's a bit grim.

13:14.208 --> 13:16.250
There's something I've got to tell you.

13:19.250 --> 13:24.458
I've offered this place to the
Equine Assisted Therapy Association.

13:24.541 --> 13:27.291
They'll be working out of the main house
quite soon.

13:27.375 --> 13:30.791
Oh, phew! I thought you were going to say
you had brain cancer or something!

13:30.875 --> 13:33.000
I'm sorry

13:33.083 --> 13:34.791
I think she is bequeathing the house to...

13:34.875 --> 13:36.000
What does this mean?

13:36.083 --> 13:39.541
-Bequeath, to pass on.
-Shut up, Audrey.

13:39.625 --> 13:42.458
Mum, so, you have given this place
to Barney the horse?

13:42.541 --> 13:47.541
No - to an association that provides
therapeutic services to those in need.

13:47.625 --> 13:50.958
Horse whispery?
-No, it's called equine therapy.

13:51.041 --> 13:54.083
Yeah, I know what it is.
It is psychotherapy with a horse.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.375
Well, they're more empathetic
than most humans.

13:56.458 --> 13:58.708
Yeah, well it's very admirable, Lois,

13:58.791 --> 14:01.666
to give to charity just so long as
it's of your own volition and not...

14:01.750 --> 14:05.250
Yeah, says she who is living in her
childhood home thanks to my charity.

14:05.333 --> 14:09.333
We contribute to the mortgage.
We paid for the kitchen renovations.

14:09.416 --> 14:10.916
So cheaply I'll have to re-do it
in five years.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.125
The cupboards aren't even a colour.

14:12.208 --> 14:14.416
-They're eggshell.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.208
Well, you've never shown
any interest in the farm.

14:16.291 --> 14:17.625
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

14:17.708 --> 14:20.458
Making sure the place doesn't
go up in a cloud of dust.

14:20.541 --> 14:23.250
Look, I could do with the company
and help with the horses.

14:23.333 --> 14:25.083
Are you going to come back and help?

14:25.166 --> 14:26.333
Look, what is it you want?

14:26.416 --> 14:28.541
Right now? A drink.

14:28.625 --> 14:30.291
Oh, can I come?

14:30.375 --> 14:34.166
Oh! It is still blazing
sunlight outside.

14:35.750 --> 14:39.291
God! Dinner at 5 o'clock?
It's absolutely ridiculous.

14:44.125 --> 14:46.833
You know, you just...
you don't think about it.

14:46.916 --> 14:50.416
You just go, "Yeah, we're having a baby!"
But you don't think what that means.

14:50.500 --> 14:55.125
I mean, I am responsible for her now,
financially, for the first time...

14:55.208 --> 14:57.083
I thought babies were cheap.

14:57.166 --> 15:02.041
Audrey, I mean. You know,
and I never really considered that.

15:02.125 --> 15:04.833
I want the best for 'em both, obviously.

15:04.916 --> 15:08.000
Why does no

15:08.083 --> 15:12.750
If I get... if I get retrenched
or if I screw up at my job...

15:12.833 --> 15:14.250
It could happen.

15:14.333 --> 15:15.791
Yes, it could happen and I can't tell her

15:15.875 --> 15:18.500
because... you know,
until I've sorted it out.

15:18.583 --> 15:19.958
Mm-hm.

15:20.041 --> 15:24.208
You know, this overseas gig -
like, I can't tell her

15:24.291 --> 15:26.041
because it would freak her out.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.208
She's got too much stress as it is.

15:28.291 --> 15:29.416
-Not really.

15:29.500 --> 15:30.833
I'd just tell her about the job

15:30.916 --> 15:34.833
but, uh, my therapist says
that I don't get, um, empathy.

15:34.916 --> 15:37.958
That's more...
it's more about honesty.

15:38.041 --> 15:40.375
-That's not really an empathy situation.
-OK.

15:42.791 --> 15:45.750
She's... she's still awake.
That's good.

15:45.833 --> 15:48.041
-It means she'll sleep tonight.
-Mm.

15:48.916 --> 15:51.041
-I'm shattered.
-Mm.

15:51.125 --> 15:52.625
One more?

15:54.625 --> 15:56.625
Yeah, one more. It's good.
It's good to talk.

15:56.708 --> 15:58.875
-I hope you don't mind.
-It's great to talk!

15:58.958 --> 16:00.541
I hope you don't mind me
saying all this stuff.

16:00.625 --> 16:04.416
-Yeah, yeah, yeah that's fine.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.000
I'm not doing well.

16:15.291 --> 16:21.625
I don't think I ever said that!

16:21.708 --> 16:24.333
Oh, hello, darling. Relaxing night?

16:24.416 --> 16:26.375
Where have you been

16:26.458 --> 16:29.416
It is Mack Hamilton. Don't be rude.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.916
Just wait over here.

16:33.791 --> 16:35.416
Was that mine?

16:35.500 --> 16:38.875
Yeah, well, we ate so long ago,
I had to have a second dinner.

16:38.958 --> 16:40.166
What are you doing?

16:40.250 --> 16:42.041
Well, I'm just catching up
with an old friend.

16:42.125 --> 16:43.833
What happened to catching up with me?

16:43.916 --> 16:45.458
I thought that's what this weekend
was about?

16:45.541 --> 16:46.625
I waited up for you.

16:46.708 --> 16:49.416
Well, honestly, darling,
you know, this afternoon,

16:49.500 --> 16:51.833
tonight was a lot for me to take on board.

16:51.916 --> 16:55.750
Well, I know and I was worried
about you and Stevie and Jeremy.

16:55.833 --> 16:58.625
No way of calling anyone.
Really relaxing night!

16:58.708 --> 17:01.000
I thought you wanted to catch up on sleep!
Goodness, you're hard to read.

17:01.083 --> 17:04.915
Alright. Look, first thing we will
go for a big, lovely walk together

17:05.000 --> 17:07.790
and I'll take you up the top where
you can get phone reception.

17:07.875 --> 17:11.875
OK, great. Thanks.

17:11.958 --> 17:13.833
I'm going to bed.

17:14.915 --> 17:18.665
I really wanted to watch
<i>Kramer vs Kramer</i> with you. Why? Aud, you're not thinking
of leaving Jeremy, are you?

17:25.500 --> 17:30.250
Come on, darling. Come on.
Please, Stevie. Yeah, me again.

17:30.333 --> 17:34.208
Still got no reception.
Fuck. Call me when you can.

17:34.291 --> 17:35.625
Everything's great, though.

17:35.708 --> 17:38.875
Oh, please take some. Please!

17:47.541 --> 17:49.750
A syringe.

17:53.208 --> 17:56.833
Come on, just a tiny... Uh-uh...
Oh, for far out!

18:42.875 --> 18:44.875
Wakey, wakey.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.791
Ow. Ow!

19:38.833 --> 19:41.625
Oh. Oh, jeez! Oh, fuck!

19:45.541 --> 19:48.208
Oh, sorry.

19:48.291 --> 19:50.333
Eugh. Oh.

20:10.708 --> 20:13.708
Morning, sleepy head.

20:13.791 --> 20:17.541
Sleepy head? We were
supposed to be going on a bush walk.

20:17.625 --> 20:20.250
Remember? You were gonna
show me where to get coverage?

20:20.333 --> 20:23.625
-I've been lost for hours.
-I thought you were having a sleep-in.

20:23.708 --> 20:25.541
Yeah, well, I could have died out there,
Mum.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.916
It was very nearly
a <i> Picnic at Hanging Rock</i> situation

20:28.000 --> 20:29.250
without the picnic.

20:29.333 --> 20:31.041
Or the beautiful dresses.

20:31.125 --> 20:33.625
Yeah. I couldn't find the track,
let alone reception.

20:33.708 --> 20:35.041
I thought it was signposted.

20:35.125 --> 20:39.041
There were no signs!
You were supposed to show me!

20:39.125 --> 20:42.083
I came across some
very hostile native fauna.

20:42.166 --> 20:44.291
Well, you found your way back
all by yourself, didn't you, darling?

20:44.375 --> 20:46.833
Yeah, well where's the car?
I need to check on Stevie.

20:46.916 --> 20:48.666
Oh, Stevie will be fine.

20:51.416 --> 20:55.541
You know, sometimes I feel, um...
I feel like you resent that I had a baby.

20:55.625 --> 20:58.000
-Nonsense!
-Well, you don't seem very interested.

20:58.083 --> 21:01.416
Well, I don't know - you want me to be
some kind of on

21:01.500 --> 21:03.458
Yeah, 'grandmother' is the word
you're looking for.

21:03.541 --> 21:06.708
Audrey, I don't know what else
I can do for you.

21:06.791 --> 21:08.375
Well, you could teach me things!

21:08.458 --> 21:13.000
Darling, you don't learn motherhood,
you live it.

21:14.333 --> 21:16.291
And frankly, dear,
I don't have a lot of spare time

21:16.375 --> 21:19.041
and you need to take responsibility
for your own family.

21:19.125 --> 21:21.291
Yeah, I don't know why I expected
anything to change.

21:21.375 --> 21:23.208
You have never... When I've needed you,
you've just...

21:23.291 --> 21:25.250
Don't pretend that you're useless!

21:25.333 --> 21:28.000
I raised you to be a strong,
independent woman.

21:28.083 --> 21:30.208
I mean, my methods may not have been
orthodox but...

21:30.291 --> 21:32.625
Yeah - like when I got
my first-ever period

21:32.708 --> 21:34.791
and you just handed me a pad
and sent me to netball.

21:34.875 --> 21:37.875
Everyone else got to stay home
with a hot water bottle.

21:37.958 --> 21:40.083
Audrey, I was teaching you that
menstruation is not an affliction.

21:40.166 --> 21:42.708
And, anyway, you played wing attack...

21:42.791 --> 21:44.958
-Goal defence.
-...that day like a queen.

21:45.041 --> 21:48.166
A queen with a very heavy,
visible flow.

21:48.250 --> 21:50.708
Oh, for goodness sake, Audrey,
that's a bit much.

21:50.791 --> 21:53.916
OK, well, I, um, I hope you had
a great night with Mack.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.125
I was getting the lowdown
on these horse people.

21:56.208 --> 22:01.666
Oh, bullshit, Mum! Psychology 101.
Male attention addiction disorder.

22:01.750 --> 22:04.041
-There's no such thing!
-And you reek of Old Spice.

22:04.125 --> 22:06.375
That is not the point.
This is my home.

22:06.458 --> 22:09.250
Just like the one that you live in
and don't you forget that.

22:10.333 --> 22:11.791
You know what? Maybe we should move out.

22:11.875 --> 22:14.333
You're losing this place.
You can keep the other one.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.416
Is that what you want?

22:17.208 --> 22:18.500
Well, it's funny you should say that

22:18.583 --> 22:21.250
because I was thinking
of starting a consultancy

22:21.333 --> 22:24.250
and I can't afford two rents
and splitting the mortgage

22:24.333 --> 22:26.333
and I've got a whopping-great
credit card bill.

22:26.416 --> 22:28.083
You know, those wretched,
irresponsible banks.

22:28.166 --> 22:29.750
That class action's going nowhere.

22:29.833 --> 22:30.833
Oh, OK.

22:30.916 --> 22:35.250
So, it would solve, well, a lot of my...
my problems.

22:35.333 --> 22:36.791
Fine. It's all yours.

22:36.875 --> 22:39.083
And now I'm going to go
and have some lunch

22:39.166 --> 22:42.916
because I am starving
and probably dehydrated.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.416
Lunch

22:46.500 --> 22:47.791
What time is it?

22:47.875 --> 22:49.416
Well, it's only just after 8:00.

22:54.916 --> 22:56.416
-Hi. I'm Martha.
-Hi.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.083
-Hi, love. I'm Barb. Martha called me.
-OK.

22:58.166 --> 22:59.291
-No.

22:59.375 --> 23:00.708
She'll be right. Come on.

23:00.791 --> 23:03.375
We had a little bit of trouble with her
last week but we got there in the end.

23:03.458 --> 23:05.416
She'll be fine. Come on.

23:10.250 --> 23:13.791
Come on. Come on. Come on!
Barney, come on.

23:13.875 --> 23:14.958
You're being a jerk. Come on.

23:15.041 --> 23:16.083
Look, he won't.

23:16.166 --> 23:20.041
-Have a chat.

23:20.125 --> 23:25.000
With him. He's mirroring you.
Lose the hostility, Audrey.

23:25.083 --> 23:26.708
Now, go on. Trot.

23:26.791 --> 23:30.916
OK. Come on. Let's go.
Nup. He is not going to...

23:31.000 --> 23:33.375
Get it off your chest.
Say whatever's on your mind.

23:33.458 --> 23:38.416
Horses can't speak but they make
excellent communicators.

23:40.583 --> 23:42.250
Your mother's doing the best she can.

23:42.333 --> 23:47.041
I know sometimes
it feels like abandonment

23:47.125 --> 23:53.625
but maybe it's freedom
to do things your way, hey?

23:53.708 --> 23:55.375
Trust yourself, Audrey.

24:00.083 --> 24:03.291
OK. This is ridiculous.

24:03.375 --> 24:06.000
No judgments, Barney, alright?

24:07.958 --> 24:09.750
Um, OK.

24:10.833 --> 24:16.291
I am sorry for sometimes wishing

24:16.375 --> 24:21.416
that Dad was here and not Verity.

24:22.500 --> 24:27.666
I'm sorry for, um...
for wishing that she was different

24:27.750 --> 24:33.958
and I'm sorry that I'm childish
and I'm selfish...

24:34.041 --> 24:37.458
and can't be content with anything.

24:39.000 --> 24:43.833
And I'm sorry that I judge her
and that I'm like her.

24:43.916 --> 24:50.666
Oh, God. And stupid.
Stupid, stupid kiss with Ruben.

24:50.750 --> 24:54.250
Why did I let that happen?
And the tongue.

24:54.333 --> 24:57.875
It wasn't my tongue.
It was his tongue.

24:57.958 --> 25:00.291
I don't know why I let that happen.

25:01.875 --> 25:04.458
Oh, what's happening? Jesus!

25:14.291 --> 25:17.166
Now, go! You can do it!

25:17.250 --> 25:20.833
Come on. Oh, shit!

25:31.125 --> 25:33.208
I don't feel great about this.

25:33.291 --> 25:36.208
Oh, no, it's... it's good.

25:36.291 --> 25:39.416
Got a pretty good latch
once she jumps on.

25:39.500 --> 25:43.875
Ooh, is she getting teeth?
Ow. Careful, darling!

25:43.958 --> 25:45.583
Whew!

25:46.833 --> 25:49.791
-Aw, all full up. Back to Daddy.
-Oh, thank you.

25:49.875 --> 25:52.000
That'll just be 20 bucks, love.

25:52.083 --> 25:54.625
Actually, you know what?
We can just make that 10.

25:54.708 --> 25:56.708
It's probably laced with
last night's sav blanc.

25:56.791 --> 25:59.833
Um, do I tell Audrey?

25:59.916 --> 26:02.541
-No.
-No. No.

26:04.125 --> 26:07.125
That was amazing.
Maybe Mum should have a session.

26:07.208 --> 26:10.833
Oh, she'll be alright,
the old drama queen.

26:10.916 --> 26:13.583
Well, it's a bit traumatic, though,
isn't it, being disinherited.

26:13.666 --> 26:17.541
And she's struggling financially
as you probably know.

26:17.625 --> 26:22.583
It's a lease, not a bestowment.
Wish you two would listen.

26:22.666 --> 26:24.291
Of course I am going to have to sell
eventually,

26:24.375 --> 26:26.541
so I can afford the assisted living

26:26.625 --> 26:29.333
when I get the cancer or whatever
it is that's going to kill me.

26:29.416 --> 26:31.666
Yeah, the brain cancer or something.

26:31.750 --> 26:33.458
Verity needs to look after herself.

26:34.541 --> 26:37.958
What do you reckon, Barney?
Any advice?

26:38.666 --> 26:40.000
He knows.

26:40.083 --> 26:41.083
Does he? Probably does.

26:45.500 --> 26:47.791
Are you sure you don't
want me to drive? You should study.

26:47.875 --> 26:49.666
No, I'll drive. You nap.

26:49.750 --> 26:51.041
Unless you want to.

26:51.125 --> 26:52.833
No, of course I don't want to.

26:58.583 --> 27:00.416
Bring the baby next time.

27:00.500 --> 27:02.041
I will.

27:04.833 --> 27:08.708
Alright. Shall we go?

27:08.791 --> 27:09.791
Oh, Mum!

27:10.583 --> 27:13.416
Oh, God. I'm sorry we fought.

27:13.500 --> 27:15.125
It's not you, darling.

27:17.041 --> 27:19.333
She's so tough on you.

27:20.916 --> 27:23.666
She's alright.
It's how she shows her love.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.416
Silly old thing.

27:42.166 --> 27:46.000
Hello? God, I missed you!
Where are you guys?

27:46.083 --> 27:47.416
In here.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.125
Oh.

27:50.305 --> 27:56.479
