WEBVTT

02:15.094 --> 02:18.640
<i>You were as blind to Him
as your footprints in the ashes,</i>

02:18.723 --> 02:20.058
<i>but He saw you.</i>

02:22.477 --> 02:24.813
He saw you in those dark corners.

02:26.397 --> 02:30.360
He heard you... My brothers.
He heard those thoughts.

02:32.570 --> 02:34.239
Amen!

02:36.032 --> 02:37.325
Yes. Glory.

02:37.575 --> 02:40.870
You are a stranger to yourself,
and yet He knows you.

02:40.954 --> 02:42.747
- Amen.
- Yes. He does, sir.

02:42.831 --> 02:45.583
And when your hard heart
made you like unto the stone

02:45.667 --> 02:47.669
and broke you from His body,

02:49.087 --> 02:52.006
which is the stars,
and the wind between the stars,

02:52.090 --> 02:53.466
He knew you!

02:55.385 --> 02:57.011
He knew you, again and forever.

02:59.639 --> 03:02.475
This world is a veil.

03:07.897 --> 03:10.900
And the face you wear is not your own.

03:11.526 --> 03:15.989
<i>Parish FD said the church
burned down four months earlier.</i>

03:16.447 --> 03:17.532
<i>No prints.</i>

03:18.116 --> 03:20.910
Put out an APB on Friends of Christ.

03:21.953 --> 03:25.290
A week later, they were in Franklin.

03:28.293 --> 03:29.460
Revival Ministry.

03:30.211 --> 03:31.796
Old-time religion.

03:32.839 --> 03:35.967
You can imagine what
Mr. Charisma thought of that.

03:36.092 --> 03:37.719
<i>It is merely the limitation of your senses.</i>

03:37.802 --> 03:41.014
What do you think the average IQ
of this group is, huh?

03:43.224 --> 03:46.185
Can you see Texas up there
on your high horse?

03:46.269 --> 03:48.271
What do you know about these people?

03:49.564 --> 03:51.608
Just observation and deduction.

03:52.066 --> 03:56.321
I see a propensity for obesity, poverty,
a yen for fairy tales.

03:57.322 --> 03:59.282
Folks putting what few bucks they do have

03:59.365 --> 04:02.118
into little wicker baskets
being passed around.

04:02.201 --> 04:03.244
I think it's safe to say

04:03.328 --> 04:06.164
that nobody here's gonna be
splitting the atom, Marty.

04:06.497 --> 04:07.540
You see that?

04:07.832 --> 04:09.667
Your fucking attitude.

04:10.376 --> 04:13.004
Not everybody wants
to sit alone in an empty room

04:13.087 --> 04:15.089
beating off to murder manuals.

04:15.715 --> 04:19.802
Some folks enjoy community,
a common good.

04:20.345 --> 04:23.431
Yeah, but if the common good's
got to make up fairy tales,

04:23.514 --> 04:25.516
then it's not good for anybody.

04:26.351 --> 04:28.853
Your sorrows pin you to this place.

04:29.562 --> 04:32.315
They divide you from what your heart knows.

04:32.398 --> 04:34.108
And there are a lot of good hearts out there.
I'm looking out there.

04:34.192 --> 04:35.526
I'm seeing a lot of good hearts out there.

04:37.195 --> 04:38.780
I see a lot of joy out there.

04:39.030 --> 04:42.951
I mean, can you imagine
if people didn't believe?

04:43.034 --> 04:44.702
What things they'd get up to?

04:45.411 --> 04:48.873
The exact same thing they do now,
just out in the open.

04:49.540 --> 04:51.542
Bullshit.

04:53.044 --> 04:56.965
It'd be a fucking freak show
of murder and debauchery, and you know it.

04:57.048 --> 04:59.133
If the only thing keeping a person decent

04:59.217 --> 05:01.302
is the expectation of divine reward,

05:01.386 --> 05:03.805
then, brother, that person is a piece of shit.

05:04.681 --> 05:08.101
And I'd like to get as many of them
out in the open as possible.

05:08.393 --> 05:12.271
I guess your judgment
is infallible, piece-of-shit-wise.

05:15.316 --> 05:18.152
You think that notebook is a stone tablet?

05:21.322 --> 05:23.866
What's it say about life?

05:25.994 --> 05:28.079
You got to get together,

05:28.413 --> 05:29.831
tell yourselves stories

05:29.914 --> 05:32.625
that violate every law of the universe,

05:33.126 --> 05:35.420
just to get through the goddamn day? No.

05:36.713 --> 05:39.090
What's that say about your reality, Marty?

05:39.257 --> 05:43.678
When you get to talking like this,
you sound panicked.

05:45.096 --> 05:47.890
<i>You figure it's all a scam, huh?
All them folks.</i>

05:48.516 --> 05:50.435
They're just wrong?

05:51.310 --> 05:53.730
Yeah. Been that way since

05:54.522 --> 05:57.275
one monkey looked at the sun
and told the other monkey,

05:57.358 --> 06:01.195
"He said for you to give me
your fucking share."

06:01.612 --> 06:05.950
People are so goddamn frail,

06:06.034 --> 06:10.288
they'd rather put a coin in a wishing well
than buy dinner.

06:10.455 --> 06:14.792
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ!
Your arms opened and close.

06:15.084 --> 06:18.546
The echoes of my life could never contain
a single truth about you!

06:18.629 --> 06:20.048
You move the feather in the ash.

06:20.131 --> 06:22.425
You touch the leaf with its flame.

06:23.217 --> 06:27.555
Transference of fear and self-loathing
to an authoritarian vessel.

06:28.347 --> 06:29.557
It's catharsis.

06:30.183 --> 06:32.477
He absorbs their dread with his narrative.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.896
Because of this, he's effective

06:34.979 --> 06:38.274
in proportion to the amount of certainty
he can project.

06:40.526 --> 06:45.031
Certain linguistic anthropologists think
that religion is a language virus

06:45.615 --> 06:48.326
that rewrites pathways in the brain,

06:48.659 --> 06:50.411
dulls critical thinking.

06:50.495 --> 06:54.916
Well, I don't use $10 words as much as you,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.753
but for a guy who sees no point in existence,

06:58.836 --> 07:01.589
you sure fret about it an awful lot.

07:02.507 --> 07:04.675
And you still sound panicked.

07:07.220 --> 07:10.348
At least I'm not racing to a red light.

07:15.269 --> 07:18.314
<i>See, we all got what I call a life trap.</i>

07:19.565 --> 07:22.485
A gene-deep certainty
that things will be different.

07:23.361 --> 07:26.697
That you'll move to another city
and meet the people

07:26.781 --> 07:28.533
that'll be the friends for the rest of your life,

07:28.616 --> 07:31.619
that you'll fall in love and be fulfilled.

07:31.702 --> 07:33.538
Fucking fulfillment.

07:35.206 --> 07:36.582
And closure.

07:36.916 --> 07:38.918
Whatever the fuck those two...

07:39.001 --> 07:42.463
Fucking need empty jars
to hold this shit storm.

07:42.547 --> 07:45.007
Nothing's ever fulfilled.

07:46.134 --> 07:48.261
Not until the very end.

07:48.386 --> 07:49.554
And closure.

07:50.054 --> 07:53.933
No. No, no. Nothing is ever over.

08:02.608 --> 08:06.237
<i>Minister Theriot,
do you recognize this girl?</i>

08:06.904 --> 08:08.281
I don't know for sure.

08:08.364 --> 08:10.241
- Wonderful service.
- Thank you for coming.

08:10.324 --> 08:11.826
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

08:12.076 --> 08:14.370
I want to say it's...

08:15.621 --> 08:16.622
Thank you.

08:17.123 --> 08:18.541
I don't remember the name.

08:18.624 --> 08:20.918
Came pretty regularly
when we was in Eunice.

08:21.794 --> 08:24.505
I can't be sure. We get around since then.

08:24.589 --> 08:26.632
You? Hello.

08:26.799 --> 08:29.010
No, you're right. We saw her in Eunice.

08:29.594 --> 08:31.179
Tina might know her.

08:32.221 --> 08:33.764
How long were you in Eunice?

08:35.266 --> 08:36.517
About six months.

08:36.601 --> 08:38.519
Widow in Opelousas leased us cheap.

08:38.603 --> 08:39.896
We left when it caught fire.

08:39.979 --> 08:41.522
Any idea how that happened?

08:42.773 --> 08:44.775
Your people said "criminal mischief."

08:45.484 --> 08:46.652
If I was to lay odds,

08:46.736 --> 08:49.530
maybe one of the widow's sons
wanted us off the land.

08:49.614 --> 08:52.283
But we move on.
We seek no title. No retribution.

08:52.825 --> 08:54.285
- I'm gonna go find Tina.
- Okay.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.704
Yeah. Great preaching.

08:56.913 --> 08:58.664
How long you been doing this?

08:59.290 --> 09:01.459
Been a preacher almost 20 years.

09:01.751 --> 09:04.128
We've had the Friends of Christ
for the last eight.

09:04.337 --> 09:06.047
You with the church before that?

09:06.589 --> 09:08.299
Independent evangelical.

09:09.050 --> 09:10.509
I came up under Billy Lee Tuttle,

09:10.593 --> 09:13.304
went to his college
in Baton Rouge a couple years.

09:13.971 --> 09:15.139
So back in Eunice,

09:16.015 --> 09:18.226
who painted the mural
on the church wall?

09:18.309 --> 09:20.603
Children from our congregation painted it.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.315
I'm sorry.

09:25.233 --> 09:28.027
Something happen
to this girl you're looking for?

09:28.110 --> 09:31.948
Mr. Theriot, can we see the identification
of your staff members?

09:33.532 --> 09:35.618
<i>You ever see her with anybody?</i>

09:36.160 --> 09:39.038
Wasn't she with someone
the one day? You remember?

09:40.164 --> 09:41.749
The tall man?

09:42.208 --> 09:45.586
Yeah, but I don't know
if she was with him, with him.

09:46.796 --> 09:48.673
Well, can you describe him?

09:51.676 --> 09:55.179
I just saw them talking.
I didn't get close or anything.

09:55.388 --> 09:58.724
He was hunched forward, talking to her.

10:00.017 --> 10:02.353
Kind of a strange face, I think.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.398
Skin shiny around his jaw.

10:06.524 --> 10:08.401
What, like burned?

10:13.364 --> 10:15.366
So did she leave with him?

10:15.783 --> 10:17.868
Yeah. Maybe like that.

10:18.369 --> 10:20.955
<i>Arrested 10-8-89 on a 314.</i>

10:21.038 --> 10:23.916
<i>Spent his last year in solitary
after a gang altercation.</i>

10:24.000 --> 10:26.294
- Print and hold. Thank you.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

10:46.564 --> 10:47.940
Everything check out?

10:48.065 --> 10:49.233
For the most part.

10:51.861 --> 10:54.530
Burt, you spent two years in Angola.

10:54.613 --> 10:57.366
Indecency, public exposure.

10:58.242 --> 11:00.786
Whacking off outside a school.

11:02.413 --> 11:05.249
They gave me bad medicine. I didn't know.

11:05.416 --> 11:07.335
I paid for that.

11:08.127 --> 11:09.420
I paid for that.

11:11.464 --> 11:15.426
Can you account for his whereabouts
December 25th through January 3rd?

11:16.218 --> 11:18.804
Yeah, Christmas to New Year's,
we was in New Roads.

11:18.888 --> 11:21.849
It shouldn't be a problem to find people
who'll vouch for Burt's whereabouts.

11:22.475 --> 11:23.809
We had a good turnout there.

11:23.893 --> 11:25.144
Good turnout.

11:26.145 --> 11:30.274
Detective, what is it you think happened?

11:31.108 --> 11:33.319
Someone killed this girl,
made a big show of it.

11:36.280 --> 11:40.326
Left a painting of the crime scene
on one of your old churches.

11:42.411 --> 11:45.915
"I am the resurrection and the life
for those who believe in me."

11:51.295 --> 11:53.297
Was she raped, Detective?

11:56.008 --> 11:57.927
Why would you ask that?

12:03.099 --> 12:05.309
If you speak to Burt alone,

12:07.019 --> 12:11.023
I believe you'll be adequately convinced
of his innocence, Detective.

12:12.149 --> 12:13.609
Okay, let's do that.

12:14.985 --> 12:18.114
Burt, go with the detective.

12:19.657 --> 12:24.370
<i>The ontological fallacy of expecting
a light at the end of the tunnel,</i>

12:24.495 --> 12:26.831
well, that's what the preacher sells.

12:27.331 --> 12:28.749
Same as a shrink.

12:29.834 --> 12:34.588
See, the preacher, he encourages
your capacity for illusion.

12:34.672 --> 12:37.007
Then he tells you it's a fucking virtue.

12:37.675 --> 12:40.177
Always a buck to be had doing that.

12:41.345 --> 12:45.891
And it's such a desperate sense
of entitlement, isn't it?

12:47.768 --> 12:49.979
"Surely this is all for me.

12:52.106 --> 12:53.190
"Me.

12:54.692 --> 12:56.777
"Me, me... I...

12:57.278 --> 12:59.280
"I'm so fucking important.

12:59.697 --> 13:01.740
"I'm so fucking important." Right?

13:03.284 --> 13:05.619
- Fuck you.
- Excuse us for a second.

13:20.009 --> 13:21.218
<i>I said no!</i>

13:21.302 --> 13:23.471
<i>Easy. I'm not gonna hurt you.</i>

13:23.554 --> 13:25.556
I'm not gonna hurt you.

13:35.399 --> 13:37.693
Compassion is ethics, Detective.

13:38.736 --> 13:40.738
Yes. It is.

13:43.282 --> 13:44.742
<i>I ran checks on all of them.</i>

13:44.825 --> 13:47.578
<i>Everyone's got a clean record except for Burt.</i>

13:47.661 --> 13:51.081
Yeah, I could see this
being some kind of retard job.

13:51.707 --> 13:54.460
He pays for it. Gets ashamed.

13:55.544 --> 13:56.962
Overreacts.

13:57.963 --> 14:01.634
Tries to redeem the act, you know?

14:02.801 --> 14:04.428
That's not bad, Marty.

14:05.429 --> 14:08.140
Yeah, I got all the way there
without your help.

14:08.307 --> 14:09.934
But it's not him.

14:11.685 --> 14:14.355
He did a deuce at the Farm for dick wagging.

14:14.438 --> 14:16.857
Should've been in a mental ward
to begin with.

14:17.274 --> 14:19.276
- Give me the second half.
- Angola.

14:20.069 --> 14:22.112
Some Bloods caught him in the shower.

14:22.613 --> 14:24.698
Took his balls off with a razor.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.116
They were sloppy about it.

14:26.492 --> 14:27.952
Oh, Jesus!

14:31.121 --> 14:32.206
Still...

14:32.706 --> 14:33.916
I braced him.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.211
He shit himself. Literally.

14:42.424 --> 14:45.970
We can put some troopers on this place,
have them surveil it,

14:46.804 --> 14:48.556
but I think we should move on.

14:48.806 --> 14:49.974
The tall man.

14:50.683 --> 14:52.476
Well, that could be bullshit.

14:53.102 --> 14:55.229
One threw it out
and the other one picked up on it.

14:55.312 --> 14:56.814
No, Burt knew.

14:57.648 --> 14:59.358
He saw the tall man, too.

15:00.484 --> 15:03.529
This. That Marie Fontenot thing.

15:03.612 --> 15:05.322
There's no way Lange was his first.

15:05.406 --> 15:07.032
No fucking way.

15:11.745 --> 15:14.373
Rosie,
can you help them get out, please?

15:27.303 --> 15:29.179
<i>We haven't matched any signatures.</i>

15:30.472 --> 15:35.019
One guy in the Fed database used crowns,
another, a set of antlers.

15:35.603 --> 15:37.021
Michigan lifer.

15:37.730 --> 15:39.898
Then we called the signature wrong.

15:42.484 --> 15:45.613
We don't know if there's any connection
to Marie Fontenot.

15:47.615 --> 15:50.868
Yeah, but the lattices, the symbology.

15:52.202 --> 15:54.371
There's some kind of culture to it, Marty.

15:57.875 --> 16:01.295
He wanted us to find this one,
like he was showing off.

16:02.212 --> 16:04.173
The cane fields are his stage.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.968
Make a suggestion, then.

16:08.052 --> 16:12.264
We could start at zero,
they're going to hand it to the task force.

16:13.182 --> 16:14.642
Well, somebody missed something.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.977
We need to go back, check all files.

16:17.061 --> 16:20.230
Any DBs in state the last five years,
we start there.

16:21.774 --> 16:23.233
We don't have the hours.

16:24.610 --> 16:26.070
Shit, man. Look...

16:27.154 --> 16:29.365
I've noticed you have
a tendency toward myopia.

16:29.907 --> 16:32.660
Tunnel vision. Blows investigations.

16:32.951 --> 16:35.746
Vision skews, twists evidence.

16:37.790 --> 16:39.249
You're obsessive.

16:40.334 --> 16:43.337
You're obsessive, too. Just not about the job.

16:44.797 --> 16:46.006
Not me, brother.

16:46.757 --> 16:49.760
I keep things even. Separate.

16:50.511 --> 16:53.597
Like the way I can have this one beer
without needing 20.

16:53.681 --> 16:57.017
People incapable of guilt
usually do have a good time.

17:02.398 --> 17:04.733
I try not to be too hard on myself.

17:06.235 --> 17:07.695
Well, that's real big of you.

17:08.445 --> 17:10.698
You know the real difference
between you and me?

17:10.781 --> 17:11.782
Yeah.

17:12.116 --> 17:13.117
Denial.

17:14.576 --> 17:17.329
The difference is that I know the difference

17:17.413 --> 17:19.415
between an idea and a fact.

17:19.498 --> 17:23.377
You are incapable of admitting doubt.

17:23.460 --> 17:25.379
Now that sounds like denial to me.

17:27.256 --> 17:28.590
I doubt that.

17:33.470 --> 17:37.474
We'll put out an APB
on any tall man with facial scarring.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.309
Okay.

17:39.476 --> 17:42.563
Telex the hospitals for patients that fit.

17:42.646 --> 17:43.814
Good.

17:58.495 --> 18:01.165
<i>So Cohle was trying
to keep it from the task force.</i>

18:02.374 --> 18:03.625
Looking back,

18:04.460 --> 18:06.003
you ever think maybe

18:06.336 --> 18:09.131
he tried to push things
where he wanted them to go?

18:11.175 --> 18:15.012
No. We went where the case led us.

18:15.721 --> 18:17.181
But you took it up, though?

18:17.431 --> 18:18.724
His serial theory?

18:19.516 --> 18:22.853
Well, as arrogant as he could be, he was right.

18:23.061 --> 18:26.148
I mean, that's how we got our man.

18:29.777 --> 18:31.445
but I like it this way.

18:31.862 --> 18:33.280
It's steady.

18:33.363 --> 18:34.865
Bullshit. Really.

18:34.948 --> 18:37.826
Look, I did all the counseling and stuff,
you know.

18:37.910 --> 18:40.454
This is just the way things are.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.206
No, things don't stay the same.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.792
Pick up what you keep
and you leave the rest behind.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.168
People get better.

18:46.335 --> 18:47.419
That's the thing.

18:48.128 --> 18:49.588
I think I am better.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.966
- You really think so?
- Trust me.

18:54.259 --> 18:57.429
Maybe you just think you prefer it this way
'cause it's what you're used to.

18:58.055 --> 18:59.765
Your life accommodates you.

19:00.599 --> 19:02.684
You don't have to be afraid of loss.

19:05.229 --> 19:07.231
Those other guys I was telling you about,

19:07.314 --> 19:10.734
they get a dog, a fish, what have you.

19:10.818 --> 19:13.070
You start with that, you live with it.

19:32.506 --> 19:35.092
Hell, I suppose you could
set me up with a nurse.

19:36.051 --> 19:37.970
Give me some of the good drugs.

19:39.847 --> 19:41.098
Would be a start.

19:43.517 --> 19:45.060
- Daddy!
- Hey, kids.

19:45.853 --> 19:46.937
Hey, honey.

19:47.229 --> 19:48.480
Hi, there, Marty.

19:54.820 --> 19:57.155
- What's going on, Rust?
- Brought the mower back.

19:59.157 --> 20:02.911
- You mowed my yard?
- Yeah, I saw it needed mowing.

20:02.995 --> 20:05.372
Return the favor. Borrowing.

20:05.789 --> 20:07.249
We got йtouffйe.

20:07.791 --> 20:10.127
Trying to get Rust to stay for dinner.

20:10.752 --> 20:13.964
Oh, yeah? Stay for dinner, Rust.

20:15.716 --> 20:17.885
No, I think I got to get.

20:19.553 --> 20:21.388
Maggie, thank you for the tea.

20:22.639 --> 20:24.349
I'm sorry to hear that.

20:26.018 --> 20:27.477
See you Monday.

20:28.812 --> 20:30.314
I'll walk you out.

20:32.482 --> 20:33.483
Hey!

20:34.651 --> 20:35.777
Hey!

20:39.323 --> 20:40.324
What?

20:41.241 --> 20:46.079
What the hell do you think you're doing, man,
at my house when I'm not here?

20:47.664 --> 20:49.166
Returning the mower.

20:49.249 --> 20:50.584
You know what I mean.

20:51.168 --> 20:54.171
You mow my lawn?

20:55.339 --> 20:58.383
Just what do you think I'd be doing over here
when you're not around, Marty?

20:59.217 --> 21:01.345
What's our problem?

21:01.803 --> 21:03.180
You and me.

21:03.263 --> 21:04.514
No problem.

21:04.848 --> 21:07.976
I just don't ever want you mowing my lawn.
All right?

21:08.060 --> 21:10.896
I like mowing my lawn.

21:44.513 --> 21:45.681
That's your team, Daddy?

21:45.764 --> 21:48.600
Yeah, baby. We want them to win.

22:01.363 --> 22:04.032
Hey, Audrey,

22:04.533 --> 22:09.413
your mom and I want to talk to you a minute
about those drawings you did in school.

22:09.913 --> 22:10.914
Yeah?

22:11.289 --> 22:13.417
- Mace, run to your room.
- Why?

22:13.667 --> 22:16.044
Because I said so. Run to... Go.

22:17.045 --> 22:18.046
Go on.

22:19.756 --> 22:20.757
Go.

22:24.511 --> 22:25.929
Go. Run.

22:31.476 --> 22:32.644
Look,

22:35.731 --> 22:37.607
you don't have to get upset, honey, okay?

22:38.942 --> 22:40.152
We just wanna talk to you.

22:40.235 --> 22:43.447
Where'd you see that before?

22:44.364 --> 22:45.949
Why'd you draw that?

22:47.034 --> 22:49.536
'Cause the other girls liked it.

22:49.745 --> 22:52.581
And they thought it was funny, is all.

22:54.332 --> 22:56.752
Yeah, but where did you get that idea?

23:01.465 --> 23:03.341
The girls dared me to do it.

23:03.800 --> 23:04.801
Oh, God.

23:05.260 --> 23:06.887
That upsets people, Audrey.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.057
It's ugly.

23:11.308 --> 23:15.479
It makes something that should be nice ugly.

23:16.646 --> 23:18.106
I'm sorry.

23:20.650 --> 23:23.111
It's okay. It's okay.

23:24.738 --> 23:26.490
It's okay, sweetie.

23:28.158 --> 23:31.161
Well, you know,
I'm not saying that I got any room to talk,

23:31.244 --> 23:34.372
but you know what it means to be a father?

23:34.998 --> 23:38.668
It means you are accountable
for other people.

23:39.419 --> 23:42.089
You are responsible for their lives.

23:42.214 --> 23:48.386
Now, past a certain point,
there's a futility in responsibility.

24:06.863 --> 24:09.407
That's the extent of your concern?

24:10.033 --> 24:14.246
No. I just don't know what
looking at it any more is gonna do.

24:15.163 --> 24:17.374
It's her. I'm concerned.

24:18.542 --> 24:21.002
Well, she's just trying to get attention.

24:21.086 --> 24:22.462
The other girls...

24:23.880 --> 24:26.550
Jesus, how do they even know
about that stuff yet?

24:26.883 --> 24:29.010
Girls always know before boys.

24:29.386 --> 24:30.387
Why is that?

24:30.679 --> 24:32.097
Because they have to.

24:33.390 --> 24:34.683
Listen to me.

24:35.267 --> 24:36.560
She's withdrawn.

24:36.726 --> 24:37.853
She asks about you

24:37.936 --> 24:40.730
and she wants to know
why you're working so much now.

24:40.856 --> 24:43.441
Well, I should be working less.

24:43.900 --> 24:46.111
Task force is gonna take that case.

24:46.611 --> 24:49.781
And I'll be around more.

24:52.868 --> 24:53.952
Last week?

24:56.121 --> 24:59.749
I'm sorry about that.
I should have begged off.

24:59.833 --> 25:01.626
We were having a good night.

25:02.085 --> 25:03.879
Don't stop me.

25:04.880 --> 25:05.881
Talk.

25:09.718 --> 25:11.386
I'm close, Marty.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.013
Do you hear me?

25:13.722 --> 25:14.806
I'm close.

25:14.931 --> 25:18.685
They're gonna pull that case from us.

25:19.769 --> 25:22.939
And I'll be around more and we'll do things.

25:23.773 --> 25:26.151
Why is there all this space
between us, Marty?

25:27.277 --> 25:28.778
I don't know what you mean.

25:28.862 --> 25:32.407
You do know what I mean
and you won't say, and that's it.

25:32.782 --> 25:34.451
That's what I'm talking about.

25:35.118 --> 25:38.663
This last year, you've been a sulky teenager,
and you know it.

25:39.623 --> 25:41.541
I'm trying to be your friend, Marty.

25:45.170 --> 25:50.759
I'm just...
I'm not good at, you know, expressing.

25:51.134 --> 25:55.138
We change, don't we?
And sometimes not for long.

25:56.223 --> 25:59.226
And here I'm thinking people
don't really change at all.

25:59.851 --> 26:01.603
Not who they are at heart.

26:02.020 --> 26:04.564
You know, I try to remember things
because I feel like I should.

26:04.648 --> 26:06.483
Like it's my job or something.

26:07.525 --> 26:08.944
Your early days.

26:10.904 --> 26:13.240
And I'm tired of trying to remember.

26:13.406 --> 26:15.075
A part of this,

26:15.825 --> 26:20.247
and I'm not talking about
the part that's all my fault,

26:20.330 --> 26:21.790
but part of it,

26:22.499 --> 26:24.084
it's just life.

26:24.960 --> 26:28.630
We used to spend weekends
without leaving my room.

26:28.713 --> 26:30.882
- That's not what I mean.
- You remember that? But it's life...

26:30.966 --> 26:33.009
Of course we don't screw like we're 19.

26:33.677 --> 26:36.846
God, you want low expectations.

26:37.514 --> 26:42.269
You put a ceiling on your life, on everything,
because you won't change.

26:44.271 --> 26:46.439
You were so much smarter when I met you.

26:46.982 --> 26:48.149
You know?

26:53.196 --> 26:55.198
I'm sorry, Maggie.

26:56.616 --> 26:58.868
I'm sorry for everything.

27:01.204 --> 27:03.331
For not being here.

27:04.416 --> 27:06.751
For taking all this for granted.

27:10.463 --> 27:12.674
What have you been doing, Marty?

27:15.260 --> 27:16.261
I...

27:19.931 --> 27:20.932
Work.

27:21.641 --> 27:22.642
Home.

27:24.060 --> 27:25.061
Cases.

27:26.980 --> 27:27.981
Just...

27:30.775 --> 27:33.111
I get the feeling like...

27:35.572 --> 27:37.615
Look, I can see 40,

27:41.995 --> 27:45.957
and it's like I'm that coyote in the cartoons.

27:47.459 --> 27:50.754
Like I'm running off a cliff,
and if I don't look down

27:51.463 --> 27:53.548
and keep running,

27:54.674 --> 27:57.010
I might be fine.

27:57.093 --> 27:59.429
But I'm...

28:02.599 --> 28:04.642
I think I'm all fucked up.

28:08.813 --> 28:10.065
You are.

28:12.025 --> 28:13.485
Yes, you are.

29:27.225 --> 29:28.393
Marty?

29:33.648 --> 29:34.983
Anyway...

29:35.650 --> 29:38.027
Well, we pulled a few hospital patients.

29:38.194 --> 29:40.530
Tall, scarred.

29:41.114 --> 29:42.407
Sex offenders.

29:42.490 --> 29:45.160
One kid did B and Es.

29:46.286 --> 29:49.456
He had to tug one out
before he could leave a scene.

29:50.457 --> 29:51.458
Phew.

29:51.541 --> 29:54.043
Yeah. And a lot of room work then.

29:56.713 --> 29:58.756
Which one of you guys is the box man?

30:00.592 --> 30:01.593
You.

30:01.676 --> 30:02.719
Yeah?

30:03.803 --> 30:06.181
I used to be pretty good in there myself.

30:07.599 --> 30:09.225
Not as good as Rust.

30:09.726 --> 30:10.727
<i>I know, son.</i>

30:11.519 --> 30:13.104
I can read this off you.

30:17.275 --> 30:18.735
You're not bad.

30:19.235 --> 30:20.778
It's not you.

30:20.904 --> 30:24.866
There's a weight, and it's got its fish hooks
in your heart and your soul.

30:36.586 --> 30:41.174
What you did is not your fault.

30:41.758 --> 30:43.092
It's not.

30:44.511 --> 30:47.889
You was drug to the bottom
by that same weight.

30:47.972 --> 30:50.558
The same weight that won't
let you get along in a job,

30:50.642 --> 30:53.728
the same weight that wouldn't
let you get along at school.

30:59.609 --> 31:02.779
The same weight that
wouldn't let you have a mom.

31:06.115 --> 31:08.409
I know these things, Chris.

31:10.620 --> 31:11.871
I'm weak.

31:13.122 --> 31:14.749
I'm sick.

31:15.083 --> 31:19.295
I get into the houses and I can't leave

31:19.379 --> 31:21.714
until I go all over their drawers.

31:22.131 --> 31:23.550
Listen to me, son.

31:25.468 --> 31:26.928
You got one way out.

31:27.804 --> 31:29.681
And it's through the grace of God.

31:30.473 --> 31:32.934
You're only how the Lord made you.

31:35.311 --> 31:37.063
You are not flawed.

31:38.314 --> 31:42.235
We, you, me, people,
we don't choose our feelings.

31:44.737 --> 31:48.116
There's grace in this world,
and there is forgiveness for all,

31:48.241 --> 31:51.244
but you have to ask for it.

31:51.369 --> 31:53.162
I do. I do. I want it.

31:53.496 --> 31:55.164
I want it.

31:55.999 --> 31:57.417
I'm asking.

31:58.001 --> 32:00.253
I'm asking. Tell me. Tell me.

32:00.336 --> 32:01.963
Please just tell me what to say.

32:02.046 --> 32:04.257
I want to confess.

32:05.341 --> 32:06.843
I want to confess.

32:15.435 --> 32:16.811
Sorry about that.

32:18.771 --> 32:20.857
Your assist record, man.

32:22.191 --> 32:23.568
That's something else.

32:23.651 --> 32:24.819
Any pointers?

32:26.863 --> 32:29.157
I never really found it that hard.

32:29.240 --> 32:33.786
You just look at somebody
and think like they think.

32:35.246 --> 32:37.498
Negative capability.

32:39.584 --> 32:41.586
I mean, I guess it's a skill.

32:42.545 --> 32:44.464
But most times, you don't even need that.

32:44.547 --> 32:47.842
You just look them in the eyes,
the whole story's right there.

32:49.594 --> 32:53.222
Everybody wears their hunger
and their haunt, you know?

32:54.807 --> 32:57.769
You just gotta be honest about
what can go on up here,

32:58.561 --> 33:00.313
a locked room.

33:03.900 --> 33:06.235
But then again, I'm terrible with cards.

33:10.406 --> 33:13.951
<i>Yeah. So while we were grilling B and E
jerk-offs and burn victims,</i>

33:14.035 --> 33:16.829
<i>I decided to put insomnia to good use.</i>

33:45.358 --> 33:46.484
<i>People...</i>

33:47.819 --> 33:50.988
<i>I've seen the finale
of thousands of lives, man.</i>

33:51.989 --> 33:53.616
<i>Young, old.</i>

33:54.283 --> 33:56.953
<i>Each one so sure of their realness,</i>

33:58.329 --> 34:01.791
<i>that their sensory experience constituted</i>

34:02.375 --> 34:04.043
<i>a unique individual,</i>

34:05.044 --> 34:06.879
with purpose, meaning.

34:09.882 --> 34:13.886
So certain that they were
more than a biological puppet.

34:16.180 --> 34:19.976
Well, yeah, the truth wills out,

34:20.059 --> 34:22.729
and everybody sees once the strings are cut,

34:22.812 --> 34:24.439
all fall down.

34:47.420 --> 34:48.838
<i>Maggie says he's shy.</i>

34:50.381 --> 34:52.383
I wouldn't say that.

34:52.467 --> 34:55.386
Definitely not shy about speaking his mind.

34:55.470 --> 34:58.431
Well, that's not what I mean. His personality.

34:58.514 --> 34:59.849
He's edgy.

35:01.267 --> 35:03.311
Yeah, intense, more like...

35:04.103 --> 35:05.146
Introvert.

35:05.396 --> 35:06.981
I don't want another drunk.

35:07.064 --> 35:08.441
The last cop you showed me...

35:08.524 --> 35:10.777
No, wait.
Steve was going through a tough time.

35:10.860 --> 35:11.944
He threw up in my lap.

35:12.028 --> 35:13.237
Don't worry about that.

35:13.321 --> 35:16.240
Getting him near your lap
is going to be the challenge.

35:17.366 --> 35:19.869
Hey. Speak of the devil.

35:20.703 --> 35:22.246
- Hey, Rust.
- Martin.

35:23.039 --> 35:24.582
- Hey, Maggie.
- Hi, Rust.

35:24.665 --> 35:25.917
- Jennifer.
- Rustin.

35:26.209 --> 35:27.627
Nice to meet you.

35:28.961 --> 35:30.213
Well...

35:31.422 --> 35:33.007
You walk over here?

35:38.846 --> 35:40.139
No?

35:41.682 --> 35:42.892
Okay.

35:51.400 --> 35:53.611
Just when I thought
he couldn't get any stranger.

35:53.736 --> 35:55.029
Are you serious?

35:55.112 --> 35:56.614
He tastes colors.

35:57.990 --> 36:00.159
So what is synesthesia?

36:00.243 --> 36:03.329
Synesthesia, it's a misalignment

36:03.621 --> 36:06.415
of synaptic receptors and triggers.

36:08.251 --> 36:10.753
Alkalis, colors, certain metallics.

36:11.879 --> 36:14.215
It's a type of hypersensitivity.

36:14.298 --> 36:17.760
One sense triggers another sense.

36:18.594 --> 36:22.765
Sometimes I'll see a color
and it'll put a taste in my mouth.

36:23.599 --> 36:26.686
A touch, a texture, a scent
may put a note in my head.

36:27.228 --> 36:28.354
I've heard of that.

36:28.437 --> 36:30.773
It can be a side effect of a statin.

36:30.940 --> 36:32.108
It's not a side effect.

36:32.191 --> 36:36.404
So when something feels good,
does that mean it feels twice as good?

36:36.946 --> 36:38.531
Like, from two different ways?

36:41.325 --> 36:42.618
It could.

36:44.370 --> 36:45.371
Yeah.

36:45.454 --> 36:46.956
The waitress will bring them, babe.

36:47.623 --> 36:49.625
Why wait? I'll be right back.

37:00.636 --> 37:02.221
Refill, and two rums.

37:14.901 --> 37:17.653
Hi, can I have another beer? Thank you.

37:19.739 --> 37:20.990
What're you doing?

37:21.657 --> 37:22.825
What's it look like?

37:23.409 --> 37:24.994
I'm on a date. Aren't you?

37:27.246 --> 37:28.497
So, you...

37:29.123 --> 37:32.627
You're gonna go home with this guy?

37:32.835 --> 37:35.421
It's really none of your business.

37:35.796 --> 37:37.673
Do you fuck your wife?

37:39.175 --> 37:40.760
What do you want me to do?

37:41.844 --> 37:44.472
Look, is this your way of
trying to talk divorce?

37:44.847 --> 37:46.307
My God, Marty.

37:46.390 --> 37:48.893
I don't wanna marry you.
That's my whole point.

37:49.685 --> 37:51.520
It's just run its course.

37:52.688 --> 37:55.399
No, it hasn't. Come here. Have a shot.

38:06.535 --> 38:07.620
Hey.

38:08.621 --> 38:10.414
I didn't just come here to drink, you know.

38:13.209 --> 38:14.877
Why don't we just set this down.

38:16.128 --> 38:17.296
It'll be fun.

38:18.756 --> 38:19.882
Yeah.

38:37.233 --> 38:38.401
What?

38:39.652 --> 38:40.820
Nothing.

38:40.903 --> 38:43.406
Thought I saw a guy
supposed to be in Paris.

38:51.580 --> 38:53.207
So, what's Alaska like?

38:54.959 --> 38:56.210
It's beautiful.

38:56.711 --> 38:58.212
It's not Paris.

38:58.295 --> 39:00.923
But it's clean and it's clear.

39:01.674 --> 39:03.009
You've been to Paris?

39:03.718 --> 39:05.011
For a month.

39:06.470 --> 39:07.930
What'd you do in Paris?

39:09.432 --> 39:12.727
Mainly just got drunk in front of Notre Dame.

39:21.527 --> 39:24.238
<i>Each still body so certain</i>

39:24.780 --> 39:27.033
<i>that they were more than
the sum of their urges.</i>

39:29.952 --> 39:31.662
<i>All the useless spinning.</i>

39:32.747 --> 39:36.542
Tired mind, collision, desire, and ignorance.

39:40.963 --> 39:42.798
You asked about the interrogations.

39:42.882 --> 39:44.258
You wanna know the truth?

39:48.637 --> 39:52.600
I never been in a room more than 10 minutes
I didn't know whether the guy did it or not.

39:55.519 --> 39:57.605
How long does it take you?

39:58.189 --> 40:01.901
Rust spent a lot of off-duty running DBs.

40:02.359 --> 40:03.694
Weeks of it.

40:04.236 --> 40:05.821
Coonhound in another life.

40:05.905 --> 40:07.031
Coonhound?

40:07.990 --> 40:10.743
I meant raccoon hound.

40:11.535 --> 40:14.288
Everybody's a fucking
drama queen nowadays.

40:14.622 --> 40:15.706
Jesus.

40:17.124 --> 40:19.585
Look, if working his theories,

40:19.668 --> 40:23.839
if his job was his idea of himself, fine.

40:24.340 --> 40:29.929
I mean, the rest of us had families,
people in our lives. Good things.

40:30.012 --> 40:31.013
People

40:31.472 --> 40:32.431
<i>give you rules.</i>

40:32.515 --> 40:35.017
<i>Rules describe the shape of things.</i>

40:42.900 --> 40:44.151
Shut up!

40:44.401 --> 40:45.694
Fuck you!

40:52.034 --> 40:53.661
Fuck, Marty. Get out of here.

40:53.744 --> 40:55.663
"Fuck, Marty." Is that all you got for me?

40:55.746 --> 40:57.665
Stop it. Go home. I don't want this anymore.

40:57.748 --> 40:59.625
You got that little shit-bird in here?

40:59.708 --> 41:01.335
Go away. I'll call the cops.

41:01.418 --> 41:03.129
Let's see how that works out for you.

41:03.212 --> 41:04.630
- I know other cops.
- Okay.

41:05.422 --> 41:06.799
Get out!

41:07.216 --> 41:08.300
Marty, get out!

41:08.384 --> 41:09.969
- She said she was single.
- Marty!

41:10.678 --> 41:11.971
Stop!

41:12.471 --> 41:14.598
- She suck your dick, huh?
- Stop it.

41:14.682 --> 41:16.684
She suck your fucking dick?

41:16.767 --> 41:18.269
Stop it! Get out!

41:18.394 --> 41:19.895
Get off!

41:19.979 --> 41:21.856
- Get off!
- Yeah, that's right.

41:22.189 --> 41:23.482
- Get off!
- You tell me,

41:23.566 --> 41:26.485
or I'll have some Ninth Ward prison queen

41:26.569 --> 41:28.279
wearing your face for a condom.

41:28.362 --> 41:32.408
Did she suck your dick?

41:32.491 --> 41:34.326
Just for a little bit.

41:34.994 --> 41:35.995
Get off.

41:37.705 --> 41:39.832
Please. Stop it.

41:43.127 --> 41:45.087
Sorry I got in your face, guy.

41:46.422 --> 41:48.924
I wouldn't have really done
something like that.

41:49.925 --> 41:51.343
I'm not a psycho.

41:58.184 --> 42:00.102
<i>That's why I always said,</i>

42:00.769 --> 42:02.813
<i>I think Rust needed a family.</i>

42:04.899 --> 42:08.110
It's boundaries. Boundaries are good.

42:38.682 --> 42:39.892
This is Cohle.

42:39.975 --> 42:41.268
<i>Rust.</i>

42:41.518 --> 42:42.645
<i>You're home. It's me.</i>

42:43.187 --> 42:44.605
<i>What's wrong?</i>

42:44.897 --> 42:47.399
I'm sorry.
Steve Geraci said he caught something.

42:47.483 --> 42:48.609
He needed help.

42:50.444 --> 42:53.572
I almost called the station,
but what's the point, you know. They lie.

42:57.284 --> 42:58.953
I gotta put you on the spot.

43:00.663 --> 43:01.872
You know if it's true?

43:04.541 --> 43:06.168
I didn't hear anything.

43:07.211 --> 43:09.004
But then again, I wouldn't.

43:09.088 --> 43:13.050
I mean, Geraci wouldn't pull me. He hates me.

43:19.848 --> 43:22.476
You drop Jen at home?

43:23.644 --> 43:26.063
<i>Yeah. I walked her to the door.</i>

43:28.524 --> 43:29.858
<i>You didn't go in?</i>

43:29.942 --> 43:32.111
<i>You don't have to fall in love at first sight,
you know.</i>

43:32.194 --> 43:36.073
No. I know. Look, she's nice, pretty.

43:36.740 --> 43:38.033
<i>There's comfort there, Rust.</i>

43:39.201 --> 43:42.329
I think you guys would be good together
if you gave it a chance.

43:43.664 --> 43:48.460
<i>You guys don't give things chances.
I don't know why that is.</i>

43:48.544 --> 43:51.046
That's because we know what we want.

43:51.755 --> 43:53.382
And we don't mind being alone.

43:56.719 --> 43:58.095
<i>Go to bed, Maggie.</i>

43:59.680 --> 44:01.724
Marty'll be home. Take care.

44:10.941 --> 44:13.444
Holy shit. Three days in a row.

44:13.527 --> 44:15.279
Is that a new personal record?

44:15.404 --> 44:16.363
Fuck off.

44:16.447 --> 44:18.907
I'll take my first shit through your sunroof.

44:19.199 --> 44:20.451
Hey.

44:20.993 --> 44:22.494
I found one, I think.

44:22.578 --> 44:24.830
Another girl from earlier. Come here.

44:29.293 --> 44:33.547
Three years ago. Flood in Abbeville.
They pulled this girl out of the river.

44:33.714 --> 44:36.759
It says here that her death was accidental.

44:36.842 --> 44:39.553
Drowned, water in the lungs.
How's that him?

44:40.596 --> 44:43.932
Coroner says that branches and debris
from the flood caused these injuries.

44:44.016 --> 44:46.769
I understand the ribs and the arms.

44:46.852 --> 44:48.062
- But the hyoid?
- Still, that's not...

44:48.145 --> 44:51.357
No fucking way. Look at this.
Lacerations through the abdomen.

44:51.440 --> 44:54.276
Plus, she was positive for meth and LSD.

44:54.568 --> 44:56.737
They said she was high. Fell in.

45:00.783 --> 45:02.284
Look at the posterior.

45:04.953 --> 45:06.705
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

45:07.039 --> 45:09.541
ID'd as Rianne Olivier, 22,

45:09.625 --> 45:12.628
lives in Pelican Island, population, 300.

45:12.961 --> 45:14.505
Grandpa's still there.

45:14.588 --> 45:16.048
Got a phone at the dock.

45:17.925 --> 45:19.927
I don't know if I can sell this shit.

45:20.010 --> 45:21.970
Two days. We dig in this direction.

45:22.721 --> 45:25.307
If this is his, it's some kind of archetype.

45:26.016 --> 45:28.894
DB, Ville Platte. Machinist. You're up.

45:28.977 --> 45:30.854
We caught a break in the case, boss.

45:31.730 --> 45:33.690
I thought you were handing that off.

45:33.774 --> 45:35.859
- What break?
- KA of the victim.

45:35.943 --> 45:38.237
Might've known the killer, boss.
Might've seen him.

45:38.320 --> 45:41.532
We follow up. We still got a few days.

45:42.825 --> 45:45.160
Two days, then it goes to task force.

45:45.244 --> 45:46.453
You two catch again.

45:48.956 --> 45:53.419
You try that serial theory on him,
he will pull you just for spite.

45:53.502 --> 45:55.421
Pelican Island's two hours away.

46:03.846 --> 46:05.180
<i>What church teaches that?</i>

46:05.264 --> 46:07.307
<i>The Christian Church does not teach that.</i>

46:07.391 --> 46:09.268
<i>The Catholic Church does not...</i>

46:16.733 --> 46:17.776
Hey.

46:19.403 --> 46:24.283
You think a man can love
two women at once?

46:25.117 --> 46:28.454
I mean, be in love with them?

46:29.037 --> 46:31.248
I don't think that man can love.

46:32.416 --> 46:34.376
At least not the way that he means.

46:35.544 --> 46:38.714
The inadequacies of reality always set in.

46:41.049 --> 46:44.428
This pipeline's carved up
this coast like a jigsaw.

46:44.511 --> 46:47.389
The place is gonna be underwater in 30 years.

46:50.893 --> 46:54.229
Do you think...

46:54.313 --> 46:55.772
Do you wonder ever

46:57.774 --> 46:59.651
if you're a bad man?

47:00.360 --> 47:02.362
No, I don't wonder, Marty.

47:04.156 --> 47:06.074
The world needs bad men.

47:09.912 --> 47:12.998
We keep the other bad men from the door.

47:49.952 --> 47:51.328
That's him.

47:55.832 --> 47:58.794
<i>When was the last time
you saw your granddaughter?</i>

48:00.003 --> 48:01.964
She left four years ago.

48:02.047 --> 48:03.423
Like her ma.

48:04.007 --> 48:06.134
I wasn't surprised they found her like that.

48:06.802 --> 48:09.888
Everybody think they're gonna be
something they're not.

48:09.972 --> 48:13.517
Everybody think they got these big plans.

48:13.934 --> 48:17.437
She had a boyfriend you know about? A man?

48:17.938 --> 48:20.732
She took up with that Ledoux fellow.

48:20.816 --> 48:21.817
Older boy.

48:21.900 --> 48:23.068
Shit family.

48:23.610 --> 48:24.987
Run off with him.

48:26.113 --> 48:29.032
I ain't never had nobody ask me
about him before.

48:29.283 --> 48:32.286
They just tell me she died in the flood.

48:32.661 --> 48:35.163
That Ledoux family,
they still live around here?

48:35.539 --> 48:37.457
Maybe a cousin or two.

48:38.333 --> 48:39.710
Been shrinking every year.

48:40.085 --> 48:43.338
Hurricane Andrew wiped most
of the folks out around here.

48:44.381 --> 48:47.259
So you got a full name on that Ledoux boy?

48:48.802 --> 48:50.012
Reggie.

48:50.637 --> 48:51.972
Reggie Ledoux.

48:52.764 --> 48:54.933
Father's Bart Ledoux.

48:55.017 --> 48:57.686
Works offshore. Drunkard.

48:57.978 --> 48:59.855
I heard he died.

49:00.689 --> 49:02.357
So, where'd Rianne go to school?

49:02.441 --> 49:04.943
Light of Way, when it was open.

49:05.277 --> 49:08.196
Kids either went there
or they were bused to Abbeville.

49:08.280 --> 49:11.950
State said a kid got to be bused
two hours away to school.

49:12.701 --> 49:15.162
I ain't too big on them God-botherers.

49:15.704 --> 49:17.205
Between them and the government.

49:18.040 --> 49:20.542
How about her parents? Other relatives?

49:21.627 --> 49:23.545
Father's a merchant seaman.

49:24.046 --> 49:26.298
Mother's in California, last I heard.

49:26.381 --> 49:29.176
Do you have anything of hers?

49:29.259 --> 49:34.723
Possessions, anything that'd give us
an idea of what she might've been like?

49:36.516 --> 49:38.518
What you boys looking all this up for?

49:39.353 --> 49:41.563
I was told she drowned in the flood.

49:42.564 --> 49:44.149
Now, I ain't no idiot.

49:44.232 --> 49:46.777
You telling me she ain't done drown?

49:47.277 --> 49:48.487
We don't know that, sir.

49:48.570 --> 49:51.198
We're just looking for a man
that might've known her.

49:51.948 --> 49:52.991
Who?

49:53.700 --> 49:55.744
That's what we're trying to figure out.

49:56.745 --> 49:59.665
<i>He ended up having a little box of her stuff,</i>

49:59.748 --> 50:02.209
had her last yearbook, 10th grade.

50:03.669 --> 50:05.754
Not a hint of feeling from the old man.

50:06.922 --> 50:08.048
Kind of guy...

50:08.548 --> 50:09.549
Blinders.

50:10.926 --> 50:13.595
But why'd he keep the box, huh?

50:14.262 --> 50:15.722
Did he ask himself?

50:18.433 --> 50:21.311
Anyway, I guess that's one way to do it.

50:21.395 --> 50:23.772
Keep your eyes on the crab traps.

50:25.440 --> 50:27.943
He kind of reminded me of Rust a little bit.

50:32.948 --> 50:34.449
This school is small.

50:35.659 --> 50:37.077
Grades 1 through 12.

50:39.830 --> 50:41.957
Rianne Olivier, here she is.

50:43.250 --> 50:44.793
Tenth grade.

50:51.925 --> 50:55.053
This school was part of Tuttle's foundation.

51:15.991 --> 51:17.242
Good afternoon.

51:17.325 --> 51:18.910
Afternoon.

51:18.994 --> 51:21.121
This place shut down in '92, right?

51:22.080 --> 51:24.750
- Yeah, way I heard it.
- What'd you hear?

51:24.833 --> 51:27.002
Well, Andrew blew it out.

51:27.669 --> 51:31.089
Guess they didn't think
it was worth cleaning up.

51:32.382 --> 51:33.592
Do you work here, then?

51:34.426 --> 51:36.303
No, sir. I work for the parish.

51:36.386 --> 51:37.846
Cover several properties.

51:39.347 --> 51:40.682
<i>I-23?</i>

51:44.186 --> 51:45.604
I-23, go.

51:45.687 --> 51:47.689
<i>I got comeback on your R and I.</i>

51:47.773 --> 51:51.693
<i>Reginald Ledoux. DOB 11-13-60.</i>

51:52.027 --> 51:55.864
You know anybody who went here
or worked here back then?

51:57.949 --> 51:58.950
No, sir.

51:59.034 --> 52:01.369
I only been coming here the last few months.

52:01.828 --> 52:03.872
Parish added it to my work order.

52:12.422 --> 52:13.840
Thank you for your time.

52:18.094 --> 52:20.180
Who walks that fucking slow?

52:23.058 --> 52:24.392
What do you got?

52:24.935 --> 52:26.603
R and I just came back.

52:26.686 --> 52:29.147
Reggie Ledoux skipped parole
eight months ago.

52:29.856 --> 52:32.317
He's got a statch rape complaint.
Charges dropped.

52:32.400 --> 52:38.907
But '93, he's busted in connection to
a narcotics lab used to make meth and LSD,

52:38.990 --> 52:41.493
which Dora Lange and Rianne were full of.

52:41.576 --> 52:42.744
Right.

52:43.078 --> 52:44.871
Ledoux did two years at Avoyelles,

52:44.955 --> 52:47.999
and guess who his cellmate was
the last four months?

52:48.083 --> 52:49.543
Charlie Lange.

52:50.168 --> 52:51.795
I gotta give you this one.

52:53.839 --> 52:56.716
<i>I started to believe you were
going a little off your nut.</i>

52:56.800 --> 52:59.511
I mean, you're bonkers, just not on this.

52:59.594 --> 53:01.304
All right. Well, where's Ledoux?

53:01.388 --> 53:03.682
Getting a list of relatives, KAs.

53:03.765 --> 53:06.059
Been out of pocket since jumping parole.

53:06.142 --> 53:07.352
We'll find him.

53:07.435 --> 53:08.436
This makes sense.

53:08.520 --> 53:09.688
It looks good, baby.

53:09.771 --> 53:11.273
All right. We are on our way.

53:11.356 --> 53:13.275
- To Avoyelles.
- Fuck, yeah, Martin. Let's go.

53:13.441 --> 53:17.195
I'm calling the interstate APB
and the U.S. Marshals on this.

53:17.362 --> 53:18.947
I-23, dispatch.

53:19.197 --> 53:20.365
<i>Come in, I-23.</i>

53:20.448 --> 53:21.575
What can I say?

53:21.658 --> 53:24.369
I thought for a minute you just liked looking
at pictures of dead people.

53:24.452 --> 53:27.205
I need an all-state APB
on one Reginald Ledoux.

53:27.289 --> 53:28.874
R and I came back with info.

53:28.957 --> 53:31.293
All U.S. Marshals
and highway patrol, be advised.

53:31.376 --> 53:32.836
Detain on sight. Over.

53:32.919 --> 53:35.297
<i>Roger that, Detective. We'll process that now.</i>

53:39.467 --> 53:45.640
And finally, we arrive at Reginald Ledoux.

53:50.979 --> 53:51.938
<i>Come on, man.</i>

53:52.022 --> 53:54.900
You wanna ask me, ask, God damn it.

53:55.817 --> 53:57.569
You ever been in a gun fight?

53:59.070 --> 54:00.071
No.

54:01.573 --> 54:04.326
Well, then how the fuck you gonna know
what I'm talking about?

54:07.162 --> 54:08.997
<i>Man, that place...</i>

54:10.165 --> 54:11.625
<i>I never...</i>

54:12.876 --> 54:16.171
<i>It reminded me of my pop talking about 'Nam.</i>

54:17.672 --> 54:19.132
<i>And the jungle thing.</i>

54:21.217 --> 54:24.346
Look, me talking about
what happened back then,

54:24.763 --> 54:27.015
that ain't gonna do you any good now.

54:30.435 --> 54:31.811
This.

54:33.521 --> 54:35.398
This is what I'm talking about.

54:37.359 --> 54:40.612
This is what I mean
when I'm talking about time

54:41.321 --> 54:44.032
and death, and futility.

54:45.867 --> 54:47.953
There are broader ideas at work.

54:48.036 --> 54:52.916
Mainly, what is owed between us,
as a society, for our mutual illusions.

54:52.999 --> 54:56.878
Fourteen straight hours of staring at DBs,

54:56.962 --> 54:59.589
these are the things you think of.

55:00.757 --> 55:02.050
You ever done that?

55:04.844 --> 55:08.807
<i>You look in their eyes, even in a picture.</i>

55:08.890 --> 55:11.893
<i>Doesn't matter if they're dead or alive,
you can still read them.</i>

55:12.852 --> 55:14.270
<i>And you know what you see?</i>

55:16.731 --> 55:18.191
They welcomed it.

55:22.070 --> 55:28.368
Not at first, but right there in the last instant,
it's an unmistakable relief.

55:28.618 --> 55:33.248
See, 'cause they were afraid
and now they saw for the very first time

55:33.915 --> 55:37.085
<i>how easy it was to just let go.</i>

55:38.169 --> 55:41.673
<i>And they saw...
In that last nanosecond, they saw</i>

55:42.757 --> 55:44.426
<i>what they were.</i>

55:44.884 --> 55:47.679
<i>That you, yourself, this whole, big drama,</i>

55:47.762 --> 55:52.392
<i>it was never anything
but a jerry-rig of presumption and dumb will.</i>

55:53.184 --> 55:54.769
<i>And you could just let go.</i>

55:55.437 --> 55:58.273
<i>Finally know that you
didn't have to hold on so tight.</i>

56:00.442 --> 56:02.027
To realize that

56:03.403 --> 56:04.779
in all your life,

56:05.280 --> 56:08.366
all your love, all your hate,
all your memory, all your pain,

56:08.450 --> 56:10.076
it was all the same thing.

56:10.827 --> 56:12.454
It was all the same dream,

56:12.537 --> 56:15.457
a dream that you had inside a locked room.

56:18.043 --> 56:22.839
A dream about being a person.

56:31.014 --> 56:32.682
<i>And like a lot of dreams,</i>

56:38.980 --> 56:41.107
there's a monster at the end of it.
