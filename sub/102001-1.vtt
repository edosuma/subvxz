<i>Now,
they're gonna be out there cleaning up</i>

00:40.932 --> 00:42.066
<i>for the next several days,
folks.</i>

00:42.100 --> 00:45.203
<i>The governor has declared
a state of emergency</i>

00:45.236 --> 00:47.105
<i>as we expect heavy flooding
and high winds</i>

00:47.138 --> 00:48.139
<i>throughout the night.</i>

00:48.172 --> 00:50.108
<i>Local authorities
are urging everyone</i>

00:50.141 --> 00:52.511
<i>to stay inside.</i>

00:52.544 --> 00:54.613
<i>For more details on the impact
on the ground,</i>

00:54.646 --> 00:56.914
<i>let's throw it over to Mia
in the newsroom.</i>

00:56.948 --> 00:58.216
- Mia.
- <i>Thank you, Tom.</i>

00:58.249 --> 01:01.285
<i>The National Weather Service
has confirmed a category 3</i>

01:01.319 --> 01:04.456

<i>You know what?</i>

01:20.204 --> 01:23.307
<i>Why don't you just stay
off the roads entirely?</i>

01:28.514 --> 01:30.148
I don't know
how long we're gonna be able

01:30.181 --> 01:31.249
to stay on the air.

01:31.282 --> 01:36.488
Keep yourself safe inside
and just get through the night.

02:02.013 --> 02:02.614
God damn, Jesus Christ!

02:02.648 --> 02:04.182
Come on, close the door.

02:04.215 --> 02:05.183
Get on in here.

02:05.216 --> 02:07.318
Ern, you got the first-aid kit?

02:07.352 --> 02:09.455
What all you do this time?

02:09.488 --> 02:12.123
Tried to swat the motherfucker,
but he disappeared.

02:12.156 --> 02:13.324
Just my luck.

02:13.358 --> 02:15.059
Was it that raccoon again?

02:15.092 --> 02:16.762
That little dumpster bitch!

02:16.795 --> 02:18.330
Well, I don't know,
this thing was flyin'.

02:18.363 --> 02:20.399
- I don't know what it was.
- Flying?

02:20.432 --> 02:21.199
Huh.

02:21.232 --> 02:23.769
That's not good.

02:23.802 --> 02:27.104
God damn.

02:27.138 --> 02:31.108
You should uh... you should
really get that checked out.

02:31.142 --> 02:32.611
If it was flying,
it might've been a...

02:32.644 --> 02:35.012
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- You feel hot?

02:35.046 --> 02:37.483
- Uh, headachey?
- No, nothing.

02:37.516 --> 02:39.718
'Cause if it was flying,
it might have been a bat.

02:39.751 --> 02:44.255
And if you got bit by a bat,
you could have rabies.

02:52.063 --> 02:55.233
You alright?

02:55.266 --> 02:57.268
I'm not good with these.

02:57.301 --> 02:58.737
Why don't you let me get you
to a doctor?

02:58.770 --> 03:00.606
There's that walk-in
a few miles out.

03:00.639 --> 03:02.641
You know, we couldn't
even if I wanted to.

03:02.674 --> 03:04.643
Tree fell down halfway
up the access road,

03:04.676 --> 03:06.378
it took out
all the streetlights.

03:06.411 --> 03:07.779
I had to walk the rest
of the way here.

03:07.813 --> 03:09.648
I got a big truck.

03:09.681 --> 03:13.117
Whatever it is, it's gonna have
to wait until sunrise.

03:13.150 --> 03:15.119
Never missed a show.

03:15.152 --> 03:17.456
Not gonna start now.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.658
Bob wants to see you
in his office.

03:24.596 --> 03:25.497
He did not.

03:25.531 --> 03:28.333
- You're kidding.
- Hand to God, sweetheart.

03:28.367 --> 03:29.601
Hand to God.

03:29.635 --> 03:31.269
- I can't believe...
- Amazing.

03:31.302 --> 03:32.236
Uh, Amy, come in.

03:32.270 --> 03:33.405
Come in.

03:33.438 --> 03:36.073
Cutting it kind of close,
don't you think?

03:36.107 --> 03:37.275
Have you looked out the window?

03:37.308 --> 03:39.411
Can't say I have.

03:39.444 --> 03:41.547
Got too good a view right here.

03:41.580 --> 03:43.682
Stop it, Robert.

03:43.715 --> 03:46.217
Please, sweetheart,
call me "Bob".

03:46.250 --> 03:47.519
- Bob.
- Robert.

03:47.553 --> 03:50.722
Amy, this is Sienna Walker.

03:50.756 --> 03:53.157
She's from...

03:53.190 --> 03:54.292
UC Berkeley.

03:54.326 --> 03:55.527
I just finished up my Master's

03:55.561 --> 03:58.095
and I came home
to take care of mom.

03:58.129 --> 04:00.197
Um...

04:00.231 --> 04:02.834
I grew up listening to you.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.069
I'm a big fan.

04:06.772 --> 04:08.373
- Nice.
- Yeah.

04:08.407 --> 04:10.742
She's gonna be
your shadow tonight.

04:10.776 --> 04:12.411
Make sure you show her
the ropes.

04:12.444 --> 04:14.211
I... I don't wanna impose, or...

04:14.245 --> 04:15.447
Oh, nonsense.

04:15.480 --> 04:16.781
She'd love to.

04:16.815 --> 04:18.649
I'm sorry, what are you?

04:18.684 --> 04:20.752
Well, I'm coming on as a sub.

04:20.786 --> 04:21.786
Mr. Collins came in on...

04:21.820 --> 04:24.590
- Bob.
- Bob...

04:24.623 --> 04:27.626
Came on Career Day
when I was a senior at Carrigan,

04:27.659 --> 04:30.762
and he gave me his card,
and told me to reach out

04:30.796 --> 04:32.864
when I entered the real world,
so...

04:34.433 --> 04:35.734
Here I am.

04:35.767 --> 04:36.602
Lovely.

04:36.635 --> 04:39.270
Yeah, it really is.

04:39.303 --> 04:40.472
You know, it's a scary time,

04:40.505 --> 04:43.240
so it's just nice
to have somebody there

04:43.274 --> 04:44.409
while you're transitioning.

04:44.443 --> 04:45.577
Well, what can I say?

04:45.611 --> 04:47.512
I've made a career... nay,

04:47.546 --> 04:52.249
a life out of seeing things
in people.

04:52.283 --> 04:54.218
- Like I did with you, Amy.
- Hmm.

04:54.251 --> 04:56.855
It's my gift.

04:58.322 --> 04:59.858
If you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna head

04:59.891 --> 05:01.893
to the ladies' room
freshen up.

05:01.927 --> 05:04.261
Good idea, Amy,
why don't you tag along?

05:04.295 --> 05:05.697
You're looking a touch pale.

05:05.731 --> 05:07.164
That's alright, thanks.

05:07.198 --> 05:08.367
I just have a face for radio.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.334
Oh, stop!

05:09.368 --> 05:10.836
You're beautiful.

05:10.869 --> 05:13.137
And you've got a show
in a few minutes, so...

05:17.274 --> 05:19.544
- You're fucking her.
- Amy!

05:19.578 --> 05:21.278
Oh, come on!

05:21.312 --> 05:22.881
I remember being her age.

05:22.914 --> 05:24.181
Do you?

05:24.215 --> 05:25.249
It was a while ago.

05:25.282 --> 05:26.317
Cut the bullshit.

05:26.351 --> 05:28.487
The fact that you have that
perception of me is fra...

05:28.520 --> 05:30.187
Oh, please, Robert!

05:30.221 --> 05:34.726
Late-night office rendezvous,
brandies, vinyl.

05:34.760 --> 05:37.529
"Call me 'Bob'."

05:37.562 --> 05:38.563
Nothing ever changes with you.

05:38.597 --> 05:40.599
Oh, come on, Amy.

05:40.632 --> 05:43.300
It's all harmless flirtation.

05:43.335 --> 05:47.472
It wasn't then
and it's not now.

05:47.506 --> 05:51.743
You loved it
when it was your turn.

05:51.777 --> 05:54.413
Play nice.

05:54.446 --> 05:56.481
You have a show.

05:58.984 --> 06:01.787
<i>You know,
that's what I like about you, Amy.</i>

06:01.820 --> 06:03.455
<i>You do your shit old school.</i>

06:03.488 --> 06:05.557
When did all this become
old school?

06:05.590 --> 06:06.558
<i>Decade ago.</i>

06:06.591 --> 06:08.593
<i>At least.</i>

06:08.627 --> 06:10.495
Go to hell.

06:12.597 --> 06:13.732
Pickin' up out there, yeah?

06:13.765 --> 06:14.332
Hmm.

06:14.366 --> 06:16.902
Never seen a storm this bad.

06:16.935 --> 06:18.570
We're stuck in here
for the night.

06:18.603 --> 06:19.538
<i>Fine by me.</i>

06:19.571 --> 06:21.573
<i>Got nowhere to be.</i>

06:21.606 --> 06:22.808
What about that girl?

06:22.841 --> 06:23.775
<i>Which one?</i>

06:23.809 --> 06:24.976
The redhead.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.511
Which one?

06:28.346 --> 06:29.381
You just met her!

06:29.414 --> 06:30.782
And she's gone.

06:30.816 --> 06:31.416
Long gone.

06:31.450 --> 06:33.385
They come and they go.

06:33.418 --> 06:36.621
Hey, I just know what I like.

06:39.725 --> 06:41.993
What do we think
of the new chick?

06:42.027 --> 06:43.862
Who you talkin' about?
Bob's new piece of ass?

06:43.895 --> 06:45.731
Somebody else thinks it, too!

06:45.764 --> 06:49.768
I mean, Amy, you gotta be blind
as a bat to not see that shit.

06:49.801 --> 06:51.803
She does have credentials,
though.

06:51.837 --> 06:53.739
Yeah.

06:53.772 --> 06:55.707
But she's no Amy Marlowe.

06:58.610 --> 06:59.745
You alright, Ames?

06:59.778 --> 07:01.913
Mm, I just didn't have dinner
tonight.

07:01.947 --> 07:02.981
You want a bite?

07:03.014 --> 07:04.683
- Garlic noodle.
- Blagh.

07:04.716 --> 07:06.551
Doesn't sit well with me.

07:14.960 --> 07:16.795
Goddammit!

07:22.501 --> 07:24.770
You still got your sweet tooth,
yeah?

07:24.803 --> 07:26.705
You wanna start
with call-ins tonight?

07:26.738 --> 07:28.774
- Call-ins?
- Yeah.

07:28.807 --> 07:30.509
We haven't done that in years.

07:30.542 --> 07:33.745
Thought it might be nice
to revive a classic.

07:35.447 --> 07:36.915
Any reason why?

07:36.948 --> 07:39.818
Always was my
favorite part of the show.

07:39.851 --> 07:43.822
My mom used to play the radio
while I fell asleep

07:43.855 --> 07:45.891
and usually she'd turn it off
once I conked out,

07:45.924 --> 07:49.928
but sometimes she'd forget.

07:49.961 --> 07:54.766
And I'd wake up
and there you were.

07:54.800 --> 07:55.934
You know,
whenever I heard your voice,

07:55.967 --> 08:00.906
I knew it was so far past
my bedtime.

08:00.939 --> 08:04.042
It felt like I was gettin' away
with something.

08:04.075 --> 08:05.610
Why the sudden nostalgia?

08:05.644 --> 08:07.112
You know,
I actually called you once.

08:07.145 --> 08:07.813
- No.
- Yeah.

08:07.846 --> 08:10.448
I must've been
8 or 9 years old.

08:10.482 --> 08:11.550
Topic of discussion...

08:13.084 --> 08:15.120
Dealing with change.

08:16.721 --> 08:17.989
What the hell
does a 9-year-old know

08:18.023 --> 08:19.424
about dealing with change,
yeah?

08:21.459 --> 08:22.894
I'd say a lot.

08:24.596 --> 08:26.898
Yeah.

08:26.932 --> 08:28.800
That's what you said then, too.

08:30.468 --> 08:31.570
What else did I say to you?

08:31.603 --> 08:32.770
Uh, incoming.

08:33.738 --> 08:37.576
It's been really great working
with you, Amy.

08:37.609 --> 08:39.678
I'm so sorry.

08:39.711 --> 08:40.712
Um, where do you want me?

08:40.745 --> 08:42.614
Oh, the fuck out of my studio.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.450
- Uh, sorry?
- Uh, you can sit there.

08:45.483 --> 08:46.585
You know Aaron.

08:46.618 --> 08:48.420
- Hi.
- Yeah.

08:48.453 --> 08:49.988
Uh, 90 seconds, Amy.

08:50.021 --> 08:53.525
You know, I've got to say
it is such an honor

08:53.558 --> 08:57.529
to watch you do your show
tonight.

08:59.064 --> 09:01.733
Uh, are you alright?

09:01.766 --> 09:05.070
- Fuck.
- Jesus, what happened?

09:05.103 --> 09:07.072
Oh.

09:07.105 --> 09:09.040
Oh.

09:10.642 --> 09:12.110
- Jesus!
- Fuck.

09:12.143 --> 09:15.046
Hey, um, if you...
if you need a minute,

09:15.080 --> 09:17.015
I can cover the beginning
of the show.

09:17.048 --> 09:18.750
Yeah, you would love that,
wouldn't you?

09:18.783 --> 09:19.551
What?

09:19.584 --> 09:20.353
Um, no.

09:20.385 --> 09:21.953
I mean I think
you're really bleeding.

09:21.987 --> 09:23.421
- No, I'm fine!
- It's bad.

09:23.455 --> 09:26.558
I'm fine, okay?

09:27.993 --> 09:31.963
And look, I'm just gonna say it,
alright?

09:31.997 --> 09:33.798
You and Bob...

09:36.801 --> 09:38.837
Listen, when I first started
here, okay...

09:38.870 --> 09:39.771
I know.

09:39.804 --> 09:40.672
I didn't realize it then, but...

09:40.705 --> 09:42.240
Look, I know what you're trying
to do, but...

09:42.274 --> 09:44.676
You don't realize it now. You've
got blinders on, that's all I'm saying.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.044
I'm not stupid.

09:46.077 --> 09:47.913
I know you're not stupid,
Miss UC Berkeley.

09:47.946 --> 09:51.783
I'm just trying to give you
some perspective, okay?

09:51.816 --> 09:52.918
Because when I was your age...

09:52.951 --> 09:54.119
My age?

09:54.152 --> 09:56.788
AMY Yes, when I was your
age, I made a lot of mistakes.

09:56.821 --> 09:58.790
And I'm just here to tell you
it's really not worth your while.

09:58.823 --> 10:00.892
Do you honestly think
I'm bangin' Bob?

10:06.831 --> 10:09.000
Look, you may have had to sleep
with him

10:09.034 --> 10:10.535
in order to lock down this job,

10:10.568 --> 10:15.674
but I only had to make him
think that I wanted to.

10:15.707 --> 10:17.542
You are such a little girl.

10:17.575 --> 10:19.044
You really hate that, don't you?

10:19.077 --> 10:20.078
10 seconds, Amy.

10:20.111 --> 10:22.180
You swan into my studio
and don't think you own it.

10:22.213 --> 10:24.516
Here's the tea, Amy.

10:24.549 --> 10:28.019
I am the one who convinced Bob
to give you one last show.

10:28.053 --> 10:28.987
As a courtesy.

10:29.020 --> 10:32.223
I mean, you were really
never my cup of kombucha,

10:32.257 --> 10:36.661
but my parents always really
did have such a soft spot

10:36.695 --> 10:38.096
for you, so...

10:38.129 --> 10:39.664
<i>...at...</i>

10:39.698 --> 10:41.232
- <i>10 Minutes to Midnight.</i>
- You're welcome.

10:44.803 --> 10:45.904
♪ 10 minutes ♪

10:45.937 --> 10:50.008

10:51.609 --> 10:52.577

10:52.610 --> 10:54.746
And it's 10 Minutes to Midnight.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.081
I'm Amy Marlowe.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.882
Keep breathing, Ames.

10:58.984 --> 10:59.851
You know, storms like this,

10:59.884 --> 11:02.120
they always make me
a little introspective

11:02.153 --> 11:04.289
and I thought tonight
I'd like to bring back

11:04.322 --> 11:07.993
an old favorite, "Ask Amy".

11:08.026 --> 11:09.294
If you're meeting
some challenges,

11:09.328 --> 11:12.130
if you need a little guidance,
give us a call.

11:12.163 --> 11:15.867
509-152-WLST.

11:15.900 --> 11:17.635
Now, before those lines
start lighting up,

11:17.669 --> 11:22.273
I want you to meet my co-host
for the night, Sienna Walters!

11:22.307 --> 11:23.174
Walker, hi.

11:23.208 --> 11:25.944
Sienna is a recent graduate
of UC Berkeley

11:25.977 --> 11:29.647
and she's here to take my job.

11:29.681 --> 11:31.082
Line 1.

11:31.116 --> 11:31.916
Hello, caller.

11:31.950 --> 11:33.618
What's your problem?

11:33.651 --> 11:35.153
<i>Oh, uh, hi.</i>

11:35.186 --> 11:38.189
<i>I... I just dumped my girlfriend,
but...</i>

11:38.223 --> 11:40.125
Aw! CALLER 1:
<i>I'm having second thoughts.</i>

11:40.158 --> 11:41.626
Sounds like it's on you, caller.

11:41.659 --> 11:42.328
<i>What?</i>

11:42.361 --> 11:44.029
- <i>No, lo... look...</i>
- Yeah.

11:44.062 --> 11:45.897
You're having some arguments,
and a dry spell...

11:45.930 --> 11:47.065
<i>Some troubles.</i>

11:47.098 --> 11:48.066
And irreconcilable differences.

11:48.099 --> 11:49.000
<i>We were just arguing.</i>

11:49.034 --> 11:52.871
I tell you what,
let's get Sienna's hot take.

11:52.904 --> 11:53.772
<i>Who?</i>

11:53.805 --> 11:54.672
Come on, speak up.

11:54.706 --> 11:55.774
Use your radio voice.

11:55.807 --> 11:57.709
Uh...

11:57.742 --> 11:59.010
I think I need more details.

11:59.044 --> 12:00.278
I think it's pretty cut and dry.

12:00.311 --> 12:02.147
<i>Come on,
are you serious right now?</i>

12:02.180 --> 12:02.947
Really, caller.

12:02.981 --> 12:05.050
I think
you're overcomplicating things.

12:05.083 --> 12:06.684
Aaron, patch the next one
through.

12:06.718 --> 12:07.685
<i>Wait, wait...</i>

12:07.719 --> 12:09.254
<i>I'm a little nervous.</i>

12:09.287 --> 12:09.888
Oh, don't be nervous.

12:09.921 --> 12:11.956
It's just your old Auntie Amy.

12:11.990 --> 12:13.625
What's your issue?

12:13.658 --> 12:16.928
<i>Well, I've just been
a listener for the longest time, Amy...</i>

12:16.961 --> 12:18.163
And you wanted to call
and tell me

12:18.196 --> 12:20.031
how much the show means to you.

12:20.065 --> 12:21.166
<i>Yeah.</i>

12:21.199 --> 12:22.067
And how your pathetic
little townie life

12:22.100 --> 12:25.003
wouldn't have any significance
without me?

12:25.036 --> 12:25.970
<i>Huh?</i>

12:26.004 --> 12:27.772
- Am I close?
- <i>What?</i>

12:27.806 --> 12:28.673
Next!

12:29.674 --> 12:31.343
You know, caller number 3,
I wanna do something

12:31.377 --> 12:32.411
a little different with you.

12:32.445 --> 12:33.044
- <i>Uh...</i>
- Okay?

12:33.078 --> 12:35.947
I'm gonna ask you the question.

12:35.980 --> 12:37.715
Now, if you had a time machine,

12:37.749 --> 12:39.951
and you could go back
and do it all again, would you?

12:39.984 --> 12:40.819
<i>Well, actually, Amy...</i>

12:40.852 --> 12:43.021
Because I haven't gotten up
with the sun

12:43.054 --> 12:45.690
- for the last 30 years.
- <i>Great.</i>

12:45.723 --> 12:47.959
And what the fuck
has it gotten me?

12:47.992 --> 12:49.794
What's my prize?

12:49.828 --> 12:52.163
I'm sitting
in a dilapidated studio

12:52.197 --> 12:54.366
with Sienna fucking Walker.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.201
I could be your mother!

12:56.234 --> 12:58.903
I mean I was in my 20s when you were
born, for God's sakes!

12:58.937 --> 13:00.406
I wouldn't even have been
a teen mom,

13:00.439 --> 13:01.706
I would've been a real mom!

13:01.739 --> 13:03.041
I... I really think that uh, we...

13:03.074 --> 13:04.343
- You think.
- We could take a break.

13:04.376 --> 13:05.243
I'm glad you think.

13:05.276 --> 13:07.212
It's important you think,
because that means

13:07.245 --> 13:08.880
you're not just legs and tits.

13:08.913 --> 13:09.914
Amy, relax.

13:09.948 --> 13:12.283
That whole idea has
just bathed me in relief.

13:12.317 --> 13:13.151
I don't actually think
that that's...

13:13.184 --> 13:15.253
But you know what?
You're absolutely right.

13:15.286 --> 13:16.154
You're right.

13:16.187 --> 13:19.124
It is not about us,
it is about the caller.

13:19.157 --> 13:21.993
And if there's one takeaway
for you tonight, caller,

13:22.026 --> 13:23.027
it's gonna be this.

13:23.061 --> 13:25.130
Oh, that's good, Amy,
just relax.

13:25.163 --> 13:28.933
At the end of the day,
your career...

13:28.967 --> 13:32.937
nay your entire fucking life
is based solely

13:32.971 --> 13:34.873
on the mercurial tastes
of a single

13:34.906 --> 13:37.175
unqualified fucking executive...

13:37.208 --> 13:38.143
<i>Okay.</i>

13:38.176 --> 13:42.180
And that, as Sienna Walker
would say, is the tea.

13:42.213 --> 13:43.415
Goodnight.

13:43.449 --> 13:45.250
Good luck.

13:45.283 --> 13:46.452
Goodbye.

13:48.052 --> 13:49.888
What the fuck was that?

13:49.921 --> 13:51.256
What the fuck is this?

13:51.289 --> 13:52.924
This is exactly the reason.

13:52.957 --> 13:54.393
- This is it.
- Spare me the bullshit!

13:54.426 --> 13:58.730
Three decades, not one meltdown,
not one slip-up!

13:58.763 --> 14:01.099
- I actually think...
- You can go the fuck to hell!

14:01.132 --> 14:02.200
...misunderstanding.

14:02.233 --> 14:04.235
Out of all the interns that
you've had coming in and out

14:04.269 --> 14:05.003
of this place the whole time,

14:05.036 --> 14:07.439
she must lick your balls
just right.

14:07.473 --> 14:08.206
Amy!

14:08.239 --> 14:10.175
You need to teach me
your technique,

14:10.208 --> 14:11.809
because that's something
I'm gonna need

14:11.843 --> 14:12.710
when I'm on the hunt tomorrow!

14:12.744 --> 14:14.846
Amy, I have nothing but respect
for you and...

14:14.879 --> 14:16.147
Amy, alright.

14:16.181 --> 14:17.449
You... you suck my asshole,
you fucking cunt!

14:17.483 --> 14:18.484
Amy, come on!
Come on!

14:18.517 --> 14:19.817
Amy, I...

14:21.920 --> 14:23.355
Amy.

14:23.389 --> 14:27.393
Are you alright?

14:31.095 --> 14:32.063
What happened?

14:32.096 --> 14:33.097
Let me see, let me see.

14:33.131 --> 14:34.999
Come on, let me see.

14:36.968 --> 14:37.802
Oh God.

14:37.835 --> 14:39.003
Oh God.

14:39.037 --> 14:40.004
I'll... I... I'll be right back.
I'm getting first-aid.

14:49.247 --> 14:50.982
Amy, why don't you tag along?

14:51.015 --> 14:53.385
You're looking a touch pale.

14:53.419 --> 14:54.486
Pale.

14:54.520 --> 14:55.487
Why?

14:55.521 --> 14:56.355
That's not good.

14:59.123 --> 15:00.158
You alright, Ames?

15:00.191 --> 15:02.126
Mm,
I just didn't have dinner tonight.

15:45.837 --> 15:47.071
Oh fuck.

16:04.155 --> 16:05.990
Amy?

16:06.024 --> 16:07.859
Amy.

16:07.892 --> 16:09.395
Amy.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.407
Amy.

16:24.208 --> 16:26.779
A word in my office
when you get a moment?

16:35.053 --> 16:38.856
Bit of a pickle, huh, Amy?

16:38.890 --> 16:41.327
I don't know what came over me.

16:41.360 --> 16:43.061
I've been doing this
for a long time,

16:43.094 --> 16:44.862
but I have to say
I've never seen anyone

16:44.896 --> 16:49.067
literally try to bite
someone's head off.

16:49.100 --> 16:52.003
It was batshit crazy, I know.

16:52.036 --> 16:54.440
How do you think
I should play this?

16:54.473 --> 16:56.642
Seriously, Amy,
what would you do

16:56.675 --> 16:58.510
if you were in my position?

17:03.014 --> 17:03.981
Fire me.

17:06.385 --> 17:08.554
It was always gonna end
this way.

17:08.587 --> 17:10.954
How do you mean?

17:10.988 --> 17:12.491
I was hired to get fired.

17:12.523 --> 17:14.157
It's radio.

17:14.192 --> 17:15.226
Well...

17:15.259 --> 17:20.332
If you knew all that, Amy,
then why make such a fuss?

17:20.366 --> 17:24.167
We had such a nice little
sunrise farewell party planned.

17:24.202 --> 17:26.472
Red velvet cake.

17:26.505 --> 17:27.673
Your favorite.

17:40.284 --> 17:42.019
So how do you see
this playing out?

17:42.053 --> 17:45.657
Oh, that is the question,
isn't it, Amy?

17:50.596 --> 17:51.663
30 years.

17:57.503 --> 17:58.604
My reputation.

17:58.637 --> 18:00.706
Gone.

18:00.739 --> 18:02.106
In an instant.

18:04.710 --> 18:07.413
Does that scare you, Amy?

18:07.446 --> 18:08.447
Sunrise?

18:11.149 --> 18:12.684
Well, as fate would have it,

18:12.718 --> 18:15.654
solar flares have had us
grappling with intermittent

18:15.687 --> 18:20.324
dead air for the better part
of the day, including now.

18:20.359 --> 18:23.429
So luckily for you,
most listeners missed

18:23.462 --> 18:25.597
the latter half
of your little tirade.

18:25.631 --> 18:28.966
We anticipate having you
back on the air within the hour.

18:30.402 --> 18:33.639
Of course, there's still
the matter of the savage assault

18:33.672 --> 18:35.674
on Miss Walker.

18:35.707 --> 18:39.445
A matter that I'm certain is
weighing on you quite heavily.

18:39.478 --> 18:44.182
And I know you may find
this frustrating,

18:44.215 --> 18:46.652
but I'm gonna have to answer
your question

18:46.685 --> 18:48.554
with one of my own,

18:48.587 --> 18:52.758
as the onus for fixing
this situation is on you.

18:52.791 --> 18:54.626
And you alone.

18:54.660 --> 18:58.464
So I ask you, Amy,

18:58.497 --> 19:02.768
how are you gonna make this
right?

19:02.801 --> 19:06.270
How are you gonna make it right?

19:09.173 --> 19:11.209
Amy?

19:12.544 --> 19:14.713
Lost you there for a second,
kiddo.

19:16.180 --> 19:18.115
Guess the solar flares
are messing

19:18.149 --> 19:20.486
with your brain waves too, huh?

19:26.525 --> 19:32.263
Well, you've got all night
to figure it out.

19:48.212 --> 19:50.314
You'll loop back.

19:52.149 --> 19:54.118
Good talk.

19:56.555 --> 19:58.390
Oh.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.059
Okay, can I see it?

20:02.093 --> 20:04.796
Well, I... I gotta be able to
look at it if I'm to uh...

20:04.830 --> 20:06.331
Can I just see it?

20:08.667 --> 20:09.434
Okay, okay, okay, okay,

20:09.468 --> 20:11.637
I need to find something
to clean that.

20:11.670 --> 20:12.738
Just uh...

20:12.771 --> 20:13.772
Okay, I need to find
something to clean that.

20:13.805 --> 20:16.240
- Hey, hurry up.
- Hold on, one second.

20:16.274 --> 20:17.409
Oh, fuck me.

20:19.378 --> 20:20.746
Uh, fuck me.

20:22.881 --> 20:24.282
Hydrogen peroxide.

20:24.315 --> 20:25.283
Topical solution.

20:31.322 --> 20:32.658
Sorry, sorry.

20:32.691 --> 20:34.158
I'm... I'm sorry.

20:34.191 --> 20:35.159
I'm sorry.

20:35.192 --> 20:36.595
Jesus, just give it to me.

20:41.232 --> 20:42.166
Sienna, look, I'm really sorry.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.268
I don't know what the fuck
came over her tonight.

20:45.804 --> 20:47.271
No, just she got one foot
in the grave,

20:47.305 --> 20:49.408
that's what fucking
came over her.

20:49.441 --> 20:50.776
What's that supposed to mean?

20:50.809 --> 20:53.210
She's washed up.

20:53.244 --> 20:56.648
She's finished
and she fucking knows it.

20:56.682 --> 20:59.216
What's that saying about grief?

21:00.419 --> 21:01.720
The stages of grief.

21:01.753 --> 21:03.120
Um, anger.

21:03.154 --> 21:03.889
- Yeah, exactly.
- Denial.

21:03.922 --> 21:05.189
It's fucking textbook.

21:22.774 --> 21:24.409
How's it going there, Amy?

21:24.443 --> 21:28.447
Change your mind
about that walk-in?

21:28.480 --> 21:29.280
Ernie, it's locked.

21:29.313 --> 21:31.783
Mmhmm.

21:31.817 --> 21:34.353
Uh, well, open it.

21:34.386 --> 21:35.721
No can do, Amy.

21:35.754 --> 21:37.389
Ernie, why is the door locked?

21:37.422 --> 21:39.691
Standard protocol
for a storm like this.

21:39.725 --> 21:41.827
Got to keep everybody safe.

21:41.860 --> 21:43.528
Ernie, I've got to get
out of here.

21:43.562 --> 21:46.331
I'm afraid it's far too late
for that, Amy.

21:46.365 --> 21:48.367
We're oscillating
between a category 2

21:48.400 --> 21:50.435
and category 3 hurricane here.

21:50.469 --> 21:55.272
That means FLP,
full lockdown procedure.

21:56.541 --> 22:01.947
Say, you don't look so good.

22:01.980 --> 22:04.181
Let me ask you this, Amy.

22:04.215 --> 22:05.517
Have you been experiencing

22:05.550 --> 22:09.421
any sort of excessive
salivation?

22:09.454 --> 22:11.623
I only ask because of your
earlier difficulty swallowing

22:11.657 --> 22:13.625
that aspirin earlier
and as I'm sure

22:13.659 --> 22:16.528
you already know
or at least suspect,

22:16.561 --> 22:18.563
excessive salivation
and difficulty swallowing

22:18.597 --> 22:22.434
are both symptoms of rabies.

22:27.973 --> 22:28.573
Ernie, I'm fine.

22:28.607 --> 22:30.809
Why don't you take a drink then?

22:30.842 --> 22:33.412
Wet your whistle.

22:33.445 --> 22:34.413
I don't want that shit.

22:34.446 --> 22:36.280
You don't have any sudden
and inexplicable aversion

22:36.313 --> 22:37.783
to water now, do you, Amy?

22:37.816 --> 22:40.251
Because if you do,
that's rabies.

22:40.284 --> 22:41.820
Ernie, are you gonna let me
out of here or not?

22:41.853 --> 22:43.755
I've gotta get out of here,
let me out of here, oh!

22:43.789 --> 22:44.723
Let's think this through, Amy.

22:44.756 --> 22:46.458
If you do have hydrophobia,

22:46.491 --> 22:49.561
you're not gonna wanna go out
in this torrential rainstorm.

22:49.594 --> 22:51.496
Jesus fucking Christ!

22:51.530 --> 22:53.932
Hope you washed your wound
with soap and water.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.004
You know, I always wondered
why they put the obits

22:59.037 --> 23:01.907
next to the funny pages.

23:01.940 --> 23:04.308
You got any idea, Amy?

23:05.744 --> 23:07.579
Ernie, I don't know
what the fuck is goin' on.

23:07.612 --> 23:09.414
Yeah.

23:09.448 --> 23:10.916
Me neither.

23:15.520 --> 23:18.289
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

23:18.322 --> 23:19.891
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

23:19.925 --> 23:21.426
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

23:21.460 --> 23:22.494
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

23:22.527 --> 23:23.962
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

23:41.312 --> 23:42.914
Amy.

23:45.484 --> 23:48.787
Real excited for you tonight,
kiddo.

23:48.820 --> 23:49.554
Robert.

23:51.022 --> 23:53.892
How many times do I have
to tell you, Amy, call me...

23:53.925 --> 23:54.726
Bob.

23:57.062 --> 23:57.896
Sorry.

23:57.929 --> 23:59.498
Sorry.

23:59.531 --> 24:01.433
Don't be sorry.

24:01.466 --> 24:03.001
A pretty girl like you shouldn't
have the word "sorry"

24:03.034 --> 24:05.437
in her vocabulary.

24:05.470 --> 24:07.405
Take a breath.

24:07.439 --> 24:10.642
You still got five minutes.

24:10.675 --> 24:13.044
I just... I get into my own head
sometimes.

24:14.546 --> 24:16.313
YOUNG
Well, lucky for you.

24:16.348 --> 24:17.983
I've got the antidote.

24:18.016 --> 24:21.653
I don't think I should drink
before a show.

24:21.686 --> 24:23.922
I hear the boss is cool with it.

24:29.528 --> 24:31.062
Your turn.

24:41.640 --> 24:42.874
Good, right?

24:44.009 --> 24:45.377
It's good.

24:47.412 --> 24:48.747
Amy Marlowe.

24:48.780 --> 24:51.016
<i>Ten Minutes to Midnight.</i>

24:51.049 --> 24:52.851
It's got a bit of a ring to it,
huh?

24:52.884 --> 24:54.085
I've been chewing on it a while.

24:54.119 --> 24:55.687
It shows.

24:55.720 --> 24:58.423
You know, most other jocks
would start

24:58.456 --> 25:00.392
right at the top of the hour.

25:00.425 --> 25:05.397
I don't think you ever told me
why you wanted the extra 10?

25:05.430 --> 25:08.099
I don't know how much
really changes day to day,

25:08.133 --> 25:11.603
but I know something does.

25:11.636 --> 25:13.972
And I kinda like the idea
of being with people

25:14.005 --> 25:16.508
during that moment
of transition.

25:16.541 --> 25:17.776
Hmm.

25:21.613 --> 25:22.981
You playin' this tonight?

25:23.014 --> 25:24.149
Plan to.

25:24.182 --> 25:28.720
You know,
I've never heard this one.

25:28.753 --> 25:31.623
Robert, I don't know
that I have much time for this.

25:35.861 --> 25:41.800
You know, I see something
in you, Amy.

25:41.833 --> 25:44.769
This show could be something.

25:44.803 --> 25:46.137
You could be something.

25:49.641 --> 25:51.743
Man, last night was...

25:51.776 --> 25:53.178
Last night was a mistake.

25:53.211 --> 25:55.814
A tease.

25:55.847 --> 25:59.417
Am I right or am I right?

26:01.653 --> 26:02.988
I know.

26:03.021 --> 26:04.489
It's new.

26:04.522 --> 26:06.057
It's all new.

26:06.091 --> 26:07.726
All of this.

26:10.729 --> 26:12.063
But it wasn't a mistake.

26:16.935 --> 26:20.438
Let people say what they want.

26:20.472 --> 26:23.441
Let people think
what they think.

26:23.475 --> 26:25.510
We're discreet, you and me.

26:25.543 --> 26:26.144
We're professionals.

26:26.177 --> 26:29.114
Yes?

26:29.147 --> 26:35.620
You are my new golden girl,
Amy Marlowe.

26:35.654 --> 26:41.760
Which is why I got you this.

26:44.496 --> 26:45.063
Bob.

26:45.096 --> 26:47.666
Now, I myself don't subscribe

26:47.699 --> 26:49.067
to the whole angel/devil thing,

26:49.100 --> 26:52.804
and truth be told, I don't know
where you stand either.

26:52.837 --> 26:55.807
But I saw you talking
to yourself

26:55.840 --> 26:58.677
before your interviews.

26:58.710 --> 27:00.812
Figured you might be praying.

27:00.845 --> 27:06.651
And in the event
anyone's listening.

27:06.685 --> 27:08.086
Dance with me.

27:08.119 --> 27:10.055
Oh.

27:10.722 --> 27:13.792
You still got two minutes, Amy.

27:13.825 --> 27:16.061
Dance with me.

27:16.094 --> 27:17.262
I have a show.

27:43.288 --> 27:44.789
We'll loop back.

27:54.099 --> 27:55.600
Good talk.

28:06.644 --> 28:07.612
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

28:07.645 --> 28:08.680
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

28:08.713 --> 28:09.781
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

28:09.814 --> 28:11.182
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

28:32.203 --> 28:33.304
Golden girl.

28:33.339 --> 28:34.239
Get away from me!

28:34.272 --> 28:35.707
Get away from me!

28:41.212 --> 28:42.113
Whoa, whoa, Amy!

28:42.147 --> 28:43.848
- He's under there.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:43.882 --> 28:44.749
He's under there,
he was coming after me.

28:44.783 --> 28:45.650
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, look at me, look.

28:45.683 --> 28:46.551
- He's was gonna try to kill me.
- Hey, hey.

28:46.584 --> 28:48.820
- He's was gonna try to kill me.
- Hey, hey.

28:48.853 --> 28:50.321
It's just one of those nights,
okay?

28:50.356 --> 28:51.222
Oh, Aaron.

28:51.256 --> 28:51.956
Oh, Aaron.

28:51.990 --> 28:52.791
You okay.

28:52.824 --> 28:53.858
Oh.

28:53.892 --> 28:55.293
- You're alright.
- I saw something.

28:57.329 --> 28:59.297
There should have never been
a night like this one.

28:59.331 --> 29:00.165
Oh fuck.

29:00.198 --> 29:01.933
Is this how you rolled back
in the day?

29:01.966 --> 29:02.667
Punk rock Amy?

29:02.700 --> 29:03.601
Take no prisoners?

29:05.637 --> 29:06.771
Shut up, Aaron.

29:08.840 --> 29:13.345
Look, Ames, I... I know
she's kind of a bitch.

29:13.379 --> 29:18.683
But that's just Sienna,
she's always like that.

29:18.716 --> 29:19.951
- Wait, what?
- I'm just sayin'.

29:19.984 --> 29:21.820
I wouldn't take it personally,

29:21.853 --> 29:25.223
'cause in my experience,
Sienna is a bitch.

29:25.256 --> 29:27.692
You know her?

29:27.725 --> 29:29.828
Well, she's been in a couple
of times this week.

29:29.861 --> 29:31.696
Don't you bullshit me.

29:32.797 --> 29:34.799
Alright,
what do you want me to say?

29:34.833 --> 29:35.867
I mean she was a skank,

29:35.900 --> 29:37.102
she swiped right on
or something?

29:37.135 --> 29:38.837
Yo, Amy, it is not like that.

29:38.870 --> 29:39.971
We went to high school together,
okay?

29:40.004 --> 29:42.006
- Oh fuck, Jesus fucking Christ.
- What?

29:42.040 --> 29:42.974
It doesn't matter!

29:43.007 --> 29:45.310
Yes, it does matter.

29:45.344 --> 29:46.378
Did you recommend her?

29:46.412 --> 29:47.379
Oh, Amy, no.

29:47.413 --> 29:48.713
- Hey.
- Why didn't you t...

29:48.746 --> 29:50.682
She talked to Bob.

29:50.715 --> 29:53.352
He asked me to show her around,
that's my fucking job.

29:53.385 --> 29:55.053
I haven't seen her
since high school.

29:55.086 --> 29:56.054
Why didn't you tell me?

29:56.087 --> 29:57.088
- Why didn't you...
- Amy.

29:57.122 --> 29:58.756
- Warn me.
- Listen.

30:00.725 --> 30:07.333
Look, I... I wanted to pretend
like this wasn't changing.

30:07.366 --> 30:10.135
If you would've known
what's goin' on,

30:10.168 --> 30:12.036
I wouldn't have been able
to do that.

30:12.070 --> 30:13.972
I would've lost you.

30:14.005 --> 30:14.906
Bullshit excuse.

30:14.939 --> 30:16.241
Bullshit excuse.

30:16.274 --> 30:17.409
Bullshit excuse.

30:17.443 --> 30:20.745
I know that
this is really hard for you.

30:20.778 --> 30:22.947
Aaron, you are a child.

30:22.981 --> 30:25.283
You have no way
of understanding.

30:25.316 --> 30:27.986
Not what you said to me
15 years ago.

30:30.054 --> 30:33.124
You could've told me.

30:33.158 --> 30:34.192
Maybe.

30:37.128 --> 30:38.763
You should talk to her.

30:38.796 --> 30:40.198
Oh, fat fuckin' chance.

30:40.231 --> 30:42.700
Amy, that's what you do,
alright?

30:42.734 --> 30:44.769
You talk to people.

30:44.802 --> 30:47.038
You're good at it.

30:47.071 --> 30:48.940
You see them
even when they're invisible.

30:51.410 --> 30:54.913
And you should know
something's...

30:54.946 --> 30:57.782
Something's goin' on
with Sienna.

30:57.815 --> 31:00.285
- What?
- Somethin's happening.

31:00.318 --> 31:01.920
I don't know.

31:01.953 --> 31:04.822
She won't show me her face.

31:04.856 --> 31:05.957
Her face?

31:05.990 --> 31:07.759
I bit her...
I bit her on her wrist.

31:07.792 --> 31:08.360
I know.

31:08.394 --> 31:11.330
She still won't show me.

31:11.363 --> 31:13.465
I think you're the only person
she'll talk to.

31:17.035 --> 31:19.737
Oh, Aaron, goddammit.

31:19.771 --> 31:21.773
Hey, hey.

31:24.075 --> 31:25.276
Where is she?

31:34.553 --> 31:37.789
Close the door.

31:47.098 --> 31:49.033
Aaron sent me to check on you.

31:54.138 --> 31:57.208
Why a bite?

31:57.242 --> 32:03.482
A slap or a shove
or spitting on me even.

32:07.018 --> 32:09.921
But a bite?

32:09.954 --> 32:13.392
That's the most unexpected thing
you've done in years.

32:14.892 --> 32:18.029
Finally something fresh.

32:21.165 --> 32:23.001
He said something was happening
with you.

32:33.545 --> 32:34.812
Oh God.

32:34.846 --> 32:39.884
Sienna, you look fine.

32:39.917 --> 32:41.853
You really don't see it.

32:44.022 --> 32:45.491
It's dark in here.

32:45.524 --> 32:48.126
I can turn the light on.

32:48.159 --> 32:50.828
You tried that before.

32:50.862 --> 32:52.230
Remember?

32:54.533 --> 32:57.001
Look, I came here,
because I wanted to...

32:57.035 --> 32:59.170
Apologize?

32:59.203 --> 33:01.873
Yeah, it's obvious.

33:01.906 --> 33:05.577
I can hear your heart ticking
from here.

33:08.380 --> 33:09.947
Why don't you just let me do it?

33:09.981 --> 33:13.352
Ugh, it must be terrible.

33:13.385 --> 33:15.487
Knowing that you dug
your own grave

33:15.521 --> 33:17.121
and now the maggots
don't even want

33:17.155 --> 33:18.424
what's left of you.

33:23.261 --> 33:28.099
If it's so awful,
what are you doing here?

33:28.132 --> 33:30.868
18 months.

33:30.902 --> 33:32.870
Long enough so that
my commitment isn't called

33:32.904 --> 33:37.343
into question and short enough
so that I don't end up like you.

33:37.376 --> 33:38.976
Oh.

33:40.646 --> 33:46.184
Oh, you wanna bite me again,
Amy Marlowe?

33:48.953 --> 33:51.022
What do you want?

33:51.055 --> 33:53.958
I... I...

33:55.326 --> 33:56.628
Yes?

33:56.662 --> 33:58.630
I want...

33:58.664 --> 34:01.600
Time?

34:01.633 --> 34:03.635
Do you see now, Amy?

34:28.960 --> 34:30.161
What's going on?

34:30.194 --> 34:31.129
What's going on?

34:31.161 --> 34:32.398
What's going on?

34:34.165 --> 34:35.199
- Oh.
- Oh!

34:35.233 --> 34:36.934
- Oh.
- Oh!

34:36.967 --> 34:38.570
You alright there, Amy?

34:38.603 --> 34:39.605
Aaron.

34:39.638 --> 34:41.172
Aaron.
Where is Aaron?

34:41.205 --> 34:43.409
Yikes, Amy, those scratch...

34:43.442 --> 34:46.545
- Oh, just...
- Marks look nasty.

34:46.578 --> 34:49.380
You know, my cousin Alistair
got bit by a rabbit

34:49.415 --> 34:51.047
when we were in scouts
and after that

34:51.081 --> 34:53.385
he never could stop scratching.

34:53.418 --> 34:55.286
That was definitely...

34:55.319 --> 34:57.389
Can you just tell me
where Aaron is?

34:57.423 --> 35:00.057
Alright, you're clearly itchy

35:00.091 --> 35:02.026
- and agitated.
- Yes.

35:02.059 --> 35:03.429
But are you also feeling
any one

35:03.462 --> 35:07.198
or a combination of fever,
headache, weakness...

35:07.231 --> 35:09.200
- Oh my God.
- Mild or moderate paralysis,

35:09.233 --> 35:09.967
- confusion...
- Mm... m...

35:10.001 --> 35:12.036
Insomnia, delirium,
hallucinations...

35:12.069 --> 35:15.039
Abnormal behavior
or generalized discomfort?

35:15.072 --> 35:16.408
Because if you are...

35:16.442 --> 35:19.043
Just tell me
where the fuck he is!

35:19.076 --> 35:21.580
Bob's office,
last time I checked.

35:21.613 --> 35:22.714
Thank you.

35:26.552 --> 35:31.189
You sure you're not seein'
anything, Amy?

35:31.222 --> 35:33.492
Anything
that's not really there?

35:35.761 --> 35:37.161
Want a bite?

35:40.566 --> 35:41.032
Ah!

35:41.065 --> 35:42.233
How's it going, kiddo?

35:42.266 --> 35:44.035
What the fuck?

35:44.068 --> 35:45.604
Rusty pipe.

35:45.637 --> 35:47.271
Where's Aaron?
Ernie said he was in here.

35:47.305 --> 35:49.708
Have you and Sienna kissed
and made up yet?

35:49.741 --> 35:51.075
What?

35:51.108 --> 35:52.344
I'm looking for him.
Where is he?

35:52.377 --> 35:54.646
She's real upset about
this whole thing.

35:54.680 --> 35:55.647
I don't give a shit.

35:55.681 --> 35:56.615
I've gotta find him.

35:56.648 --> 35:59.651
You can't make friends
if you don't make amends.

35:59.685 --> 36:01.787
You know what?
Yes, I have seen Sienna.

36:01.820 --> 36:04.556
She's in the tech room turning
into a fucking monster.

36:04.590 --> 36:06.758
Uh... uh, don't call names, Amy.

36:06.792 --> 36:07.626
What?

36:07.659 --> 36:09.227
You women should be building
each other up,

36:09.260 --> 36:10.729
not tearing each other down.

36:10.762 --> 36:13.499
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Whoa, Amy!

36:13.532 --> 36:15.801
There is a literal
fucking monster out there.

36:15.834 --> 36:17.669
Airways are back up.

36:17.703 --> 36:19.203
Oh, excellent, Aaron.

36:19.237 --> 36:20.238
Uh, thank you.

36:20.271 --> 36:21.305
Oh, thank God.

36:21.340 --> 36:22.407
Thank God, thank God,

36:22.441 --> 36:23.675
I've been looking everywhere
for you.

36:23.709 --> 36:24.175
Second.

36:24.208 --> 36:25.511
We're running ads now.

36:25.544 --> 36:27.379
- Show's back up in four.
- Perfect.

36:27.412 --> 36:28.747
That's four minutes, everyone.

36:28.780 --> 36:32.818
Four minutes
to the final curtain.

36:32.851 --> 36:34.218
What's goin' on?

36:34.252 --> 36:35.654
Aaron, I don't trust anyone.

36:42.694 --> 36:45.597
Okay, wait a sec.

36:45.631 --> 36:46.331
Rewind for me.

36:46.365 --> 36:48.299
I told you
it doesn't make sense.

36:49.735 --> 36:52.270
Maybe, you should go
to the walk-in, Amy.

36:52.303 --> 36:53.805
These symptoms sound
pretty textbook.

36:53.839 --> 36:54.640
Sienna say that?

36:54.673 --> 36:58.610
Amy, you got bit
by a wild animal tonight.

36:58.644 --> 37:00.679
Who knows what kind of diseases
those things are carrying?

37:00.712 --> 37:04.716
Nothing that is happening to me
is textbook.

37:04.750 --> 37:09.086
Well, maybe you should go
lay down for a little bit.

37:09.120 --> 37:12.123
I couldn't sleep if I...

37:12.156 --> 37:13.090
Asleep.

37:13.124 --> 37:14.493
I must be asleep.

37:14.526 --> 37:16.361
I must be dreaming.

37:16.395 --> 37:17.663
That's it.

37:17.696 --> 37:19.230
This isn't real.

37:19.263 --> 37:20.264
That's it.

37:20.298 --> 37:20.732
That's it.

37:20.766 --> 37:21.733
That's it.

37:21.767 --> 37:23.669
It's... it's... it's...
it's a dream or I'm sleeping

37:23.702 --> 37:25.671
or I passed out or something
on the way in.

37:25.704 --> 37:28.774
It's... but... but...
but you've gotta wake me up.

37:28.807 --> 37:30.542
You gotta wake me up,
you gotta shake me,

37:30.576 --> 37:33.277
- you gotta scare me!
- Okay, Amy, just fucking relax!

37:33.311 --> 37:35.581
Okay, so let's say that
this is a dream.

37:35.614 --> 37:37.281
If that's the case,
I'm not even really me, right?

37:37.315 --> 37:40.586
I'm part of you.

37:40.619 --> 37:43.321
Aaron, I've been here
a long time

37:43.355 --> 37:45.591
and nobody sees me
the way you do.

37:45.624 --> 37:47.859
Okay.

37:47.893 --> 37:49.561
Okay.

37:49.595 --> 37:51.730
Then just for the sake
of argument,

37:51.763 --> 37:54.733
let's assume
this is a nightmare.

37:54.766 --> 38:00.639
If that is actually the case,
why would I be on your side?

38:03.575 --> 38:04.610
Yeah, I just don't think

38:04.643 --> 38:06.310
I'm following your logic here,
Ames.

38:06.345 --> 38:07.746
Ow!

38:08.547 --> 38:09.781
Fuckin' hell!

38:09.815 --> 38:10.515
And if this was a dream,

38:10.549 --> 38:12.417
that wouldn't have hurt
like that!

38:14.486 --> 38:16.320
Fuck.

38:22.427 --> 38:23.294
Fuck.

38:23.328 --> 38:24.496
Yeah, Amy, I don't think
there's anything that

38:24.529 --> 38:27.499
I can do anything for you here
that you can't do for yourself.

38:27.532 --> 38:29.501
Oh, but there is.

38:29.534 --> 38:31.770
Oh, but there is.
You can hurt me.

38:31.803 --> 38:32.671
What?

38:32.704 --> 38:33.639
Remember, last month
when we had that doctor

38:33.672 --> 38:37.576
on the air, he was talking
about lucid dreaming.

38:37.609 --> 38:39.344
Remember that?

38:40.746 --> 38:43.382
Pain snaps you right out of it.

38:43.415 --> 38:45.851
Amy, I'm not gonna fucking
hurt you.

38:45.884 --> 38:47.719
I'm not asking you.

38:49.286 --> 38:50.389
What the fuck!

38:50.422 --> 38:51.390
Amy, what the fuck!

38:51.423 --> 38:52.424
Stop it!

38:52.457 --> 38:53.290
Stop it!

38:53.324 --> 38:54.660
Are you fucking crazy?

38:55.360 --> 38:56.260
Stop it!

38:56.293 --> 38:57.696
Stop it!

39:09.441 --> 39:11.175
What the fuck!

39:15.414 --> 39:16.948
Amy.

39:21.753 --> 39:23.989
One minute till you're back on.

39:24.022 --> 39:26.223
No.

39:26.257 --> 39:27.426
No, no, no, no, no, no.

39:27.459 --> 39:29.494
- Yes, yes, yes!
- No!

39:29.528 --> 39:31.396
Come on, kiddo.

39:31.430 --> 39:34.265
Let's give 'em a show
to die for.

39:35.333 --> 39:36.300
Oh!

39:37.869 --> 39:39.905
There's Amy!

39:42.507 --> 39:43.975
Ready, boss?

39:44.009 --> 39:45.410
Yes, Ernie.

39:45.444 --> 39:48.413
Please, escort Ms. Marlowe
to Studio A.

39:48.447 --> 39:50.515
No, no, Ernie,
what are you doing?

39:50.549 --> 39:52.316
- Amy.
- Stay the fuck away from me!

39:52.350 --> 39:53.618
You must fulfill your final
contractual obligations.

39:53.652 --> 39:54.986
Stay the fuck aw...

39:56.287 --> 39:57.823
- You know this.
- Let me go!

39:57.856 --> 39:58.790
Aaron, go check the levels.

39:58.824 --> 39:59.858
Let me go, god dammit!

39:59.891 --> 40:01.393
Let's go, up and out.

40:01.426 --> 40:02.293
Fuck you!

40:02.326 --> 40:02.861
- Amy...
- Aaron...

40:02.894 --> 40:03.662
You're very loud.

40:03.695 --> 40:04.996
Aaron, don't go, don't go,
don't go.

40:05.030 --> 40:07.833
Help me out, please.

40:07.866 --> 40:09.668
- Sorry, Amy.
- Please.

40:09.701 --> 40:10.736
I still have a future here.

40:10.769 --> 40:11.636
No!

40:11.670 --> 40:12.838
Fucking let go of me!

40:12.871 --> 40:15.640
Why the sudden stage fright,
Amy?

40:15.674 --> 40:18.343
Oh, you fucking bastard!

40:18.376 --> 40:20.412
Got a little fire in you!

40:20.445 --> 40:21.780
I'll miss that.

40:23.348 --> 40:24.750
<i>45 seconds, Amy.</i>

40:28.487 --> 40:29.721
Aaron?

40:29.755 --> 40:30.989
Aaron?

40:31.022 --> 40:31.957
You gotta help me, man.

40:31.990 --> 40:33.992
You're losing it, Amy.

40:34.025 --> 40:35.794
Everyone's saying so.

40:35.827 --> 40:36.862
What?

40:36.895 --> 40:37.629
No, no!

40:37.662 --> 40:38.363
You are... no, no.

40:38.396 --> 40:39.598
<i>30 seconds.</i>

40:39.631 --> 40:40.732
You and me, we sh...

40:40.766 --> 40:43.435
You care about me,
I care about you.

40:43.468 --> 40:44.903
- Don't do this.
- 15 seconds.

40:44.936 --> 40:46.905
If I were 30 years younger,
me and you, maybe we would've...

40:46.938 --> 40:49.341
<i>But you're not.</i>

40:49.374 --> 40:50.942
You're old.

40:53.512 --> 40:55.547
You motherfucker.

40:55.580 --> 40:58.517
Who the hell
do you think you are?

40:58.550 --> 41:00.085
Go back to your cum dumpster!

41:00.118 --> 41:01.486
See if I care!

41:01.520 --> 41:02.687
10 seconds.

41:02.721 --> 41:05.924
I bled for this place
for 30 goddamn years,

41:05.957 --> 41:08.560
but they still want
another fuckin' night.

41:08.593 --> 41:09.628
5, 4...

41:09.661 --> 41:12.697
I've been at the center
of this so-called joke too long.

41:12.731 --> 41:14.566
You fucking sons of...

41:14.599 --> 41:16.401
It's <i>Ten Minutes to Midnight</i>.

41:16.434 --> 41:18.069
I'm Amy Marlowe.

41:28.013 --> 41:31.783
I think
I'm going to die tonight.

41:31.817 --> 41:33.451
But I don't know
how many of you are listening.

41:33.485 --> 41:38.790
I don't know
if anybody is listening,

41:38.824 --> 41:42.828
but I think I'm gonna die.

41:42.861 --> 41:46.631
It's a strange thing,
your last day.

41:46.665 --> 41:48.767
In anything, really.

41:48.800 --> 41:53.004
School, work, life.

41:53.038 --> 41:57.075
Everything's the same,
till it's not.

42:00.078 --> 42:03.982
Routine becomes ritual,
becomes obsession,

42:04.015 --> 42:08.553
till you're nothing more
than a broken record.

42:08.587 --> 42:10.021
That's good shit.

42:13.491 --> 42:14.726
It's pretty fucked up, right?

42:14.759 --> 42:15.994
<i>Caller on 2.</i>

42:20.599 --> 42:23.468
Hello, caller?

42:23.501 --> 42:24.836
Caller?

42:31.910 --> 42:34.613
Sounding a little morbid, Amy.

42:34.646 --> 42:36.081
Sienna.

42:36.114 --> 42:39.484
Is this really
how you wanna go out?

42:39.517 --> 42:43.488
Does anybody know the answer
to that question?

42:43.521 --> 42:47.659
I'd guess most people think
about it more than they admit.

42:47.692 --> 42:49.828
Is that so?

42:49.861 --> 42:55.500
Why don't you
just accept it, Amy?

42:55.533 --> 42:58.603
And walk silently
into the sunrise?

42:58.637 --> 43:00.705
No.

43:00.739 --> 43:02.908
Rage into the night.

43:10.782 --> 43:13.418
What do you
see when you look in the mirror?

43:16.655 --> 43:19.524
I don't see anything.

43:19.557 --> 43:20.759
Not anymore.

44:05.003 --> 44:08.206
Fuck.

44:08.239 --> 44:10.775
Amy.

44:15.180 --> 44:17.182
Amy.

44:33.999 --> 44:35.967
I don't understand.

44:37.268 --> 44:41.072
I don't fear change, Amy.

44:41.106 --> 44:42.907
I adapt.

44:45.677 --> 44:48.246
Just a few hours now.

45:05.764 --> 45:07.198
He's yours.

45:16.241 --> 45:18.043
Yes.

45:18.076 --> 45:19.577
Yes.

45:19.611 --> 45:21.312
You want it now, don't you?

45:21.347 --> 45:22.847
Yes.

45:24.983 --> 45:28.319
You gave this to me, Amy.

45:28.354 --> 45:31.189
Let me give this to you.

45:38.096 --> 45:41.066
You know...

45:41.099 --> 45:44.135
...I see something in you, Amy.

45:44.169 --> 45:47.305
This show could be something.

45:47.339 --> 45:48.973
You could be something.

45:51.410 --> 45:54.012
You still got two minutes, Amy.

46:31.816 --> 46:33.352
I'll try to make sure
nobody knows

46:33.385 --> 46:34.919
it went down this way.

46:37.188 --> 46:40.925
We're discreet, you and me.

46:40.959 --> 46:43.027
We're professionals.

46:55.474 --> 46:57.376
Okay, come in.

47:06.718 --> 47:08.052
So what happens now?

47:13.158 --> 47:15.260
You never felt anything?

47:15.293 --> 47:16.462
What?

47:16.495 --> 47:17.996
For me.

47:18.029 --> 47:20.064
- Amy.
- Anything for me.

47:21.933 --> 47:25.036
I mean of course, I did.

47:25.069 --> 47:27.105
You know, it was just...

47:27.138 --> 47:28.273
this was all hard enough
you know,

47:28.306 --> 47:32.177
with... with you having to leave.

47:32.210 --> 47:33.445
But now...

47:35.113 --> 47:37.982
You know, we could be together.

47:41.420 --> 47:45.957
Given the circumstances.

47:49.361 --> 47:51.363
Together?

47:51.397 --> 47:52.797
Yeah.

47:52.830 --> 47:54.366
Yeah.

47:54.400 --> 47:58.370
Yeah, I mean I gotta say this...
this is...

47:58.404 --> 48:00.805
You look really hot.

48:00.838 --> 48:03.409
I mean honestly, you looked
like 20 years younger before.

48:03.442 --> 48:07.078
I was just trying to be nice,
but now I...

48:07.111 --> 48:09.448
I can't resist you.

48:09.481 --> 48:12.750
Nice?

48:12.784 --> 48:14.953
Yeah, you know what I meant.

48:14.986 --> 48:17.021
Nice would've been telling me

48:17.055 --> 48:19.157
that my head
was on the chopping block.

48:19.190 --> 48:20.825
I was in my head before.

48:20.858 --> 48:21.859
Okay?

48:21.893 --> 48:24.128
I told you... I was...
I was just... I was in my head,

48:24.162 --> 48:26.498
but now, it's all you.

48:26.532 --> 48:28.099
I pro...

48:28.132 --> 48:31.470
It's all you, Amy, I promise.

48:31.503 --> 48:32.270
Look, you said that

48:32.303 --> 48:33.171
we were gonna figure this out
together.

48:33.204 --> 48:36.975
So come on,
let's figure this out together!

48:37.008 --> 48:39.777
I already have, Aaron.

48:39.811 --> 48:41.447
I gotta tell you...

48:45.316 --> 48:48.420
...feels like I'm getting away
with something.

50:21.413 --> 50:23.948
It's <i>10 Minutes to Midnight.</i>

50:23.981 --> 50:26.385
I'm Amy Marlowe.

50:26.418 --> 50:27.353
<i>Hi.</i>

50:27.386 --> 50:32.424
<i>Uh, Amy, can you...
can you hear me?</i>

50:32.458 --> 50:34.360
Yes, caller, I can hear you.

50:34.393 --> 50:35.394
<i>Oh, great.</i>

50:35.427 --> 50:40.098
<i>Well um, yeah,
I... I just started this new job</i>

50:40.131 --> 50:43.067
<i>a few months ago and it's...</i>

50:43.101 --> 50:44.370
<i>It's tough.</i>

50:46.672 --> 50:49.441
<i>I don't really do this
for a thing, ask for advice.</i>

50:49.475 --> 50:51.577
<i>I do talk to myself a lot,
though, that helps.</i>

50:53.044 --> 50:56.648
<i>But uh, my friend...
uh, my friend said</i>

50:56.682 --> 51:00.552
<i>I should call, talk to someone
who's maybe been there before.</i>

51:03.020 --> 51:05.357
Do you dislike
what you're doing?

51:05.391 --> 51:06.991
<i>Oh, no.</i>

51:07.024 --> 51:07.559
<i>No, it's not that.</i>

51:07.593 --> 51:08.660
<i>I... I love the work.</i>

51:08.694 --> 51:11.330
<i>It's just...</i>

51:11.363 --> 51:14.932
<i>...the environment
can be challenging.</i>

51:17.001 --> 51:19.638
<i>I've always
been really sure of myself.</i>

51:19.671 --> 51:23.609
<i>That's what all my teachers
said in school, but right now,</i>

51:23.642 --> 51:28.012
<i>I'm honestly feeling
kind of lost.</i>

51:28.045 --> 51:33.419
<i>Uh, I'm...</i>

51:33.452 --> 51:37.689
<i>I'm doing things
that I never thought I'd do.</i>

51:41.460 --> 51:43.729
Well, we all have to start
somewhere.

51:43.762 --> 51:46.632
<i>That's
what I keep telling myself.</i>

51:46.665 --> 51:49.033
<i>Nobody falls right into
where they want to be,</i>

51:49.066 --> 51:51.169
<i>it takes time, sacrifice.</i>

51:51.202 --> 51:57.041
<i>But I still can't help feeling
like I'm letting someone down.</i>

51:57.074 --> 51:59.110
Your mom?

51:59.143 --> 52:00.446
- Dad?
- <i>Oh, no.</i>

52:01.914 --> 52:05.983
<i>I've always
pretty much been on my own.</i>

52:06.017 --> 52:08.286
Who then?

52:08.319 --> 52:11.122
<i>I don't know.</i>

52:11.155 --> 52:13.090
<i>Somebody.</i>

52:13.124 --> 52:16.528
<i>Out there.</i>

52:16.562 --> 52:18.464
<i>I was just hoping maybe
you could give me some advice</i>

52:18.497 --> 52:24.268
<i>or I don't know um, point me
in the right direction.</i>

52:24.302 --> 52:28.039
You seem like somebody
who knows who she is.

52:28.072 --> 52:29.541
<i>I guess you could say that.</i>

52:32.478 --> 52:36.180
But what about what you want?

52:36.214 --> 52:38.216
<i>I have some ideas.</i>

52:38.249 --> 52:40.419
<i>Goals.</i>

52:40.452 --> 52:45.657
<i>Mostly it's feelings, though.</i>

52:45.691 --> 52:48.627
What does that mean?

52:48.660 --> 52:52.331
<i>You know what's funny, Amy?</i>

52:52.364 --> 52:53.532
<i>I listen to you every night</i>

52:53.565 --> 52:59.338
<i>and I still don't even know
what you look like.</i>

52:59.371 --> 53:01.072
<i>I don't even have a picture
of you in my mind,</i>

53:01.105 --> 53:07.446
<i>but still there's this intimacy.</i>

53:10.482 --> 53:18.423
<i>The cadence of your voice,
the vibrations.</i>

53:18.457 --> 53:22.661
<i>Like I know you
from the inside out.</i>

53:22.694 --> 53:29.267
<i>And so there's just this strong,
warm sense within me</i>

53:29.300 --> 53:32.771
<i>that you're beautiful.</i>

53:36.508 --> 53:40.579
<i>Someone seeing me like that.</i>

53:40.612 --> 53:42.614
<i>I think that's what I want.</i>

53:47.553 --> 53:50.422
It sounds like
you're on your way.

53:52.791 --> 53:54.626
Amy's Advice?

53:54.660 --> 53:56.862
<i>Please.</i>

53:56.895 --> 54:00.832
Trust that warm feeling.

54:00.866 --> 54:02.601
Hold on to it.

54:05.269 --> 54:07.071
Let it lead you.

54:11.543 --> 54:14.479
<i>Thanks, Amy.</i>

54:14.513 --> 54:17.081
<i>Maybe if I'm lucky,
one day I'll end up like you.</i>

54:21.787 --> 54:24.790
Good luck, caller.

54:24.823 --> 54:28.860
<i>Oh,
and congratulations on retirement.</i>

54:28.894 --> 54:31.262
<i>I know some people
can be sad on days like this,</i>

54:31.295 --> 54:34.131
<i>but you did it!</i>

54:34.165 --> 54:36.133
<i>The hard part's over.</i>

54:36.167 --> 54:37.369
<i>Enjoy the victory lap.</i>

55:37.529 --> 55:39.196
Goddamn, Jesus Christ!

55:39.230 --> 55:41.400
Come on, close the door.

55:41.433 --> 55:42.701
Get on in here.

55:46.805 --> 55:51.308
Oh, what all did you do
this time?

55:51.343 --> 55:52.411
Aaron?

55:52.444 --> 55:53.612
Oh, he's already
in the sound booth.

55:53.645 --> 55:57.281
By the way, Bob wants to see you
in his office before the show.

55:57.314 --> 55:58.315
No.

55:58.350 --> 56:00.752
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- That looks pretty nasty.

56:00.786 --> 56:02.721
Was it that raccoon again?

56:02.754 --> 56:05.424
That little dumpster bitch.

56:05.457 --> 56:07.993
Sure hope
he doesn't have rabies.

56:08.026 --> 56:08.960
What is going on?

56:08.994 --> 56:11.228
- What is going on?
- Hey, hey, hey, relax, Amy.

56:11.262 --> 56:13.665
The storm's got everyone
feelin' a little crazy.

56:13.699 --> 56:15.767
It's just one of those nights,
yeah?

56:18.737 --> 56:19.705
He did not.

56:19.738 --> 56:21.573
You have got to be kidding me.

56:21.606 --> 56:22.874
Hand to God, sweetheart.

56:22.908 --> 56:23.775
Hand to God.

56:25.644 --> 56:28.513
Amy, come in.

56:28.547 --> 56:30.549
Cutting it kind of close,
don't you think?

56:33.385 --> 56:34.886
Uh, Earth to Amy?

56:38.724 --> 56:40.324
Have you looked out a window?

56:40.358 --> 56:41.827
I can't say that I have.

56:41.860 --> 56:43.327
Got too good of a view
right here.

56:43.361 --> 56:45.030
Oh Robert, stop it.

56:45.063 --> 56:46.263
Please, sweetheart.

56:46.297 --> 56:48.800
- Call me "Bob".
- Bob.

56:48.834 --> 56:50.335
Sienna.

56:50.368 --> 56:52.504
Hmm, do you two know each other?

56:52.537 --> 56:54.740
Oh, no, I would've remembered.

56:54.773 --> 56:56.875
I grew up listening to you.

56:56.908 --> 56:58.944
Big fan.

56:58.977 --> 57:00.345
Then how do you know...

57:00.378 --> 57:02.614
Aaron uh, told me.

57:02.647 --> 57:03.482
I mean Ernie.

57:03.515 --> 57:04.616
Ernie.

57:04.649 --> 57:08.353
Are you alright, Amy?

57:08.386 --> 57:10.321
Never better.

57:10.355 --> 57:11.189
Alright, great.

57:11.223 --> 57:13.892
Well, she's gonna be
your shadow tonight,

57:13.925 --> 57:16.027
so make sure you show her
the ropes.

57:16.061 --> 57:18.396
Now, I don't want to impose.

57:18.430 --> 57:19.364
Nonsense.

57:19.397 --> 57:20.732
- She'd love to.
- I'd love to.

57:25.003 --> 57:28.373
Good on you, kiddo.

57:28.406 --> 57:30.976
You remember how it is.

57:31.009 --> 57:35.514
It's nice to have someone there
when you're transitioning.

57:35.547 --> 57:37.516
<i>You know,
that's what I like about you, Amy.</i>

57:37.549 --> 57:38.817
<i>You do it old school.</i>

57:43.355 --> 57:45.289
<i>Storm's really picking up, huh?</i>

57:47.492 --> 57:48.660
You want a bite?

57:48.693 --> 57:50.028
Garlic noodle.

57:52.697 --> 57:54.699
What's up with you tonight?

57:54.733 --> 57:59.437
Storm got you feeling
a little tweaked?

57:59.471 --> 58:01.373
Something like that.

58:01.406 --> 58:03.108
Oh, actually, you know what?

58:03.141 --> 58:04.943
It's probably solar flares.

58:04.976 --> 58:10.715
Bob said they've been causing
dead air for most of the day.

58:10.749 --> 58:11.550
I heard that.

58:11.583 --> 58:12.417
Yeah, but don't worry,

58:12.450 --> 58:14.686
we should be good
for the big show tonight.

58:16.621 --> 58:17.422
So sorry.

58:17.455 --> 58:18.657
Where do you want me?

58:22.627 --> 58:24.963
Sienna,
can you get Robert for me?

58:24.996 --> 58:26.097
What?

58:26.131 --> 58:27.032
Robert.

58:27.065 --> 58:28.099
I need him.

58:28.133 --> 58:30.635
Now.

58:30.669 --> 58:32.637
Uh, yeah.

58:32.671 --> 58:33.805
Sure.

58:41.813 --> 58:43.582
Everything alright there, Ames?

58:49.921 --> 58:54.559
When did you know
this was gonna be my last show?

58:54.593 --> 58:56.461
Uh, just...

58:56.494 --> 58:57.929
Give it to me straight.

59:01.066 --> 59:02.367
A week ago.

59:10.976 --> 59:12.110
Thanks.

59:18.783 --> 59:20.752
Kiddo, what's going on?

59:20.785 --> 59:22.754
I'm not gonna
beat around the bush.

59:22.787 --> 59:24.055
This is it.

59:24.089 --> 59:25.123
Last show.

59:25.156 --> 59:25.724
I'm being replaced.

59:25.757 --> 59:27.959
Amy, let's not make a fuss.

59:27.993 --> 59:31.596
We have a nice sunrise
farewell party for you planned.

59:31.630 --> 59:33.498
Red velvet cake.

59:33.531 --> 59:34.566
Yes, your favorite.

59:34.599 --> 59:35.834
My favorite.

59:40.639 --> 59:41.806
Five seconds, Amy.

59:49.681 --> 59:51.750
It's <i>10 Minutes to Midnight.</i>

59:51.783 --> 59:53.084
I'm Amy Marlowe.

59:54.219 --> 59:59.658
Amy, my God, you really stuck
the landing tonight, huh.

59:59.691 --> 01:00:01.893
I knew you had it in you.

01:00:01.927 --> 01:00:05.196
And this... this is all for you.

01:00:24.049 --> 01:00:25.717
Why do you look so depressed?

01:00:33.091 --> 01:00:35.560
You earned this.

01:00:35.593 --> 01:00:36.728
Enjoy.

01:00:52.577 --> 01:00:53.878
Having fun?

01:00:55.814 --> 01:00:59.551
You did great tonight.

01:00:59.584 --> 01:01:01.987
What's wrong?

01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:04.055
I don't know who I am
without this place.

01:01:04.089 --> 01:01:06.057
Uh, Amy.

01:01:06.091 --> 01:01:07.158
Robert.

01:01:09.327 --> 01:01:10.595
Aaron, I just...

01:01:12.964 --> 01:01:15.166
You're leaving a legacy behind.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.535
Oh bullshit.

01:01:17.569 --> 01:01:19.537
The only thing you ever
leave behind is a headstone

01:01:19.571 --> 01:01:21.806
and you're lucky
if you get that.

01:01:23.041 --> 01:01:25.643
Well, I can't say
I'm not gonna miss you.

01:01:25.677 --> 01:01:27.112
Too little, too late, I know,

01:01:27.145 --> 01:01:30.682
but I always kinda had a crush
on you.

01:01:31.916 --> 01:01:33.184
You ever feel like
you know someone?

01:01:33.218 --> 01:01:36.888
I mean really know them.

01:01:36.921 --> 01:01:39.924
Even if you've never seen them
before?

01:01:44.763 --> 01:01:45.630
Of course, you do.

01:01:45.663 --> 01:01:48.700
Who am I talking to here?

01:01:48.733 --> 01:01:52.270
Ever realize the opposite
is true?

01:01:52.303 --> 01:01:54.606
What do you mean?

01:01:54.639 --> 01:01:57.742
That people aren't
who you think they are.

01:01:57.776 --> 01:01:59.310
That you never really
knew anybody.

01:02:13.359 --> 01:02:14.659
Hmm.

01:02:14.692 --> 01:02:15.860
Hey!

01:02:15.894 --> 01:02:17.595
Alright, everybody!

01:02:17.629 --> 01:02:18.663
It's time for cake!

01:02:18.696 --> 01:02:20.031
Oh yeah!

01:02:20.065 --> 01:02:21.400
Yeah, it's time to cut,
come on...

01:02:21.434 --> 01:02:24.069
<i>We'll keep rolling
into forever as we raise a glass</i>

01:02:24.102 --> 01:02:27.105
<i>to the vintage vixen
of radio land.</i>

01:02:27.138 --> 01:02:30.342
<i>Let's make some noise
and keep the party rolling</i>

01:02:30.376 --> 01:02:32.077
<i>for the lady of the hour</i>

01:02:32.110 --> 01:02:34.946
<i>and her last trip
down the airwaves.</i>

01:02:34.979 --> 01:02:37.248
<i>It's Amy Marlowe, everybody.</i>

01:02:37.282 --> 01:02:41.753
<i>Come on and show her the love
while you still can.</i>

01:02:41.786 --> 01:02:42.821
Oh, there she is.

01:02:42.854 --> 01:02:45.790
Amy, my dear, Amy.

01:02:45.824 --> 01:02:47.125
My golden girl.

01:02:47.158 --> 01:02:50.261
30 years you've been with me!

01:02:50.295 --> 01:02:54.699
30 glorious years.

01:02:54.732 --> 01:02:58.002
And I do declare,
without a shadow of a doubt,

01:02:58.036 --> 01:03:01.106
you have given us
everything you have to give

01:03:01.139 --> 01:03:04.309
and tonight was no exception.

01:03:04.343 --> 01:03:06.978
I mean, what a finale!

01:03:07.011 --> 01:03:08.246
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

01:03:08.279 --> 01:03:09.013
Am I right?

01:03:09.047 --> 01:03:09.981
- That's right?
- Yeah.

01:03:10.014 --> 01:03:15.354
Oh, oh, I remember
the very first day I met you,

01:03:15.387 --> 01:03:17.722
my dear Amy Marlowe.

01:03:17.755 --> 01:03:20.892
She was a shy young thing.

01:03:20.925 --> 01:03:23.429
But we gave you a voice,
and a platform,

01:03:23.462 --> 01:03:28.733
and the rest is,
as the scholars say, history.

01:03:29.667 --> 01:03:34.172
And I have made a career,
as you know, nay...

01:03:34.205 --> 01:03:35.441
SIENNA, ROBERT, AND CROWD:
A life!

01:03:35.474 --> 01:03:36.908
Right!

01:03:36.941 --> 01:03:40.945
Out of seeing things in people.

01:03:40.979 --> 01:03:46.918
And rest assured,
your memory will surely live on.

01:03:46.951 --> 01:03:51.022
Your spirit is entombed
in this building

01:03:51.055 --> 01:03:54.893
for as long as these walls
shall stand.

01:03:54.926 --> 01:03:56.294
To Amy.

01:03:56.327 --> 01:03:57.328
To Amy!

01:03:57.363 --> 01:03:58.229
Yes.

01:04:00.965 --> 01:04:02.401
Of course, what kind of party
would be this be

01:04:02.434 --> 01:04:03.768
without presents?

01:04:12.076 --> 01:04:12.777
Yeah, come on.

01:04:12.810 --> 01:04:14.279
Come on bring her up,
bring her up.

01:04:14.312 --> 01:04:15.780
Come on, man.

01:04:18.116 --> 01:04:20.752
Oh, Amy, there she is.

01:04:22.488 --> 01:04:24.689
Ernie, take it away.

01:04:27.359 --> 01:04:32.096
Well, mine is a little bit more
of a memento than a gift.

01:04:34.098 --> 01:04:35.334
I didn't wind it.

01:04:35.367 --> 01:04:36.968
Thought you'd like to spend
as much time

01:04:37.001 --> 01:04:39.237
in 10 minutes to midnight
as you could.

01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:40.171
Aaron.

01:04:40.205 --> 01:04:42.474
Oh,
he's got somethin' for you, too.

01:04:42.508 --> 01:04:44.376
But first, Sienna.

01:04:47.245 --> 01:04:49.047
Got a little sneaky
and found out the year

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.081
you were born.

01:04:50.114 --> 01:04:52.784
Never would have guessed
with how beautiful you are.

01:04:52.817 --> 01:04:54.852
This was bottled
that same summer.

01:04:54.886 --> 01:04:57.523
May it fill your veins
with the weight of history.

01:05:10.802 --> 01:05:15.240
To close the circle, Amy,

01:05:15.273 --> 01:05:19.043
you're as beautiful
as the day you started here.

01:05:19.077 --> 01:05:22.414
And finally on behalf
of everyone here,

01:05:22.448 --> 01:05:26.751
both past and present,
now and forever.

01:05:31.423 --> 01:05:34.025
Well, perhaps now,
you'll finally be able

01:05:34.058 --> 01:05:36.961
to get some of that
much needed rest, Amy.

01:05:43.067 --> 01:05:44.235
Aaron.

01:05:44.269 --> 01:05:45.136
Hmm.

01:05:45.169 --> 01:05:47.305
These people, who are they?

01:05:49.475 --> 01:05:51.543
You don't know them?

01:05:51.577 --> 01:05:52.378
I don't know.

01:05:52.411 --> 01:05:55.880
I... I... I think so,
I... but I... maybe.

01:05:55.913 --> 01:05:58.082
I don't know.

01:05:58.116 --> 01:06:02.120
You're not alone, Amy.

01:06:02.153 --> 01:06:05.823
It happens to everyone.

01:06:05.857 --> 01:06:07.792
It's time to say goodbye.

01:06:12.864 --> 01:06:13.898
Goodbye?

01:06:17.268 --> 01:06:20.138
God!

01:06:20.171 --> 01:06:23.308
It feels like forever
when you're in the middle.

01:06:23.342 --> 01:06:26.978
By the time you get there,
it's like...

01:06:30.948 --> 01:06:32.216
You know?

01:06:33.918 --> 01:06:36.988
I don't.

01:06:37.021 --> 01:06:39.591
Not yet at least.

01:06:39.625 --> 01:06:43.294
But I will.

01:06:43.328 --> 01:06:46.598
The end's always coming, Amy.

01:06:46.632 --> 01:06:51.936
Can't outrun it, 'cause
we're always moving toward it.

01:06:51.969 --> 01:06:56.274
Just like that.

01:07:00.512 --> 01:07:04.550
I'm scared.

01:07:04.583 --> 01:07:06.518
I don't know what to do.

01:07:10.288 --> 01:07:13.091
Give into it, Amy.

01:07:18.262 --> 01:07:20.532
The sun is rising.

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:25.236
Oh, everyone,

01:07:25.269 --> 01:07:28.973
