WEBVTT

00:00.008 --> 00:01.384
Mr. Phillips,

00:01.431 --> 00:03.566
what brings you to our little town?

00:03.574 --> 00:06.413
We're expanding into the north
east, and I'm here to set it up.

00:06.436 --> 00:07.797
Who is he?

00:07.821 --> 00:09.557
Guy who works for us. You stay.

00:09.596 --> 00:11.035
I've got to go over something with him.

00:11.332 --> 00:12.412
Mr. Narcisse.

00:12.458 --> 00:14.820
Dr. Narcisse, Mr. Thompson.

00:14.875 --> 00:17.111
Your friend is facing a difficulty.

00:17.158 --> 00:20.349
Your employee slashed
the throat of my employee.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.023
Just say how much.

00:22.070 --> 00:24.518
It is for you to decide what
your friendship is worth.

00:24.533 --> 00:26.175
10% of the club.

00:26.207 --> 00:27.599
That's my judgment.

00:27.607 --> 00:29.515
And the other problem goes away.

00:29.635 --> 00:31.228
Here.

00:31.348 --> 00:32.463
Thanks.

00:32.509 --> 00:34.676
- What's your name?
- Roger.

00:36.686 --> 00:39.697
- What is this?
- It's heroin, that's all.

00:45.219 --> 00:46.978
Do you have any family?

00:46.994 --> 00:48.386
Wife.

00:48.425 --> 00:49.872
Two girls.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.141
I can't.

00:54.251 --> 00:57.677
How did Dickie know what
hotel to find you in?

00:58.365 --> 00:59.882
I was raped.

00:59.905 --> 01:03.198
This is a tale I've
heard one time too many.

01:03.221 --> 01:04.096
No!

01:04.144 --> 01:06.326
Stop! No!

01:08.218 --> 01:09.682
Regarding Florida...

01:09.802 --> 01:11.410
I have packed your bags.

01:15.440 --> 01:25.440

03:04.049 --> 03:06.183
(faint music playing)

03:19.630 --> 03:23.199
(tennis ball bouncing)

03:30.406 --> 03:32.407
(birds screeching)

03:32.808 --> 03:34.809
(thunder rumbling)

03:41.117 --> 03:43.751
And that, my boy, is how it's done.

03:44.787 --> 03:46.287
Welcome to Tampa,

03:46.388 --> 03:48.322
land of money, cunny,

03:48.423 --> 03:50.158
and where it's always sunny.

03:50.258 --> 03:52.860
First two sound good, but
the third I could do without.

03:52.961 --> 03:55.830
Eight months in stir,
you'd sing a different tune.

03:55.931 --> 03:57.732
There's either a three-mile
limit or there ain't.

03:57.833 --> 03:59.366
- Am I right?
- Tell it to the judge.

03:59.467 --> 04:01.868
I did and I still got fucked.

04:01.969 --> 04:03.269
Man: All right, 15-love.

04:04.939 --> 04:08.441
Three ships full of scotch gone.

04:08.542 --> 04:09.943
- (snaps fingers)
- Like that.

04:10.044 --> 04:11.978
Tell me there ain't some
admiral with his feet up

04:12.080 --> 04:13.580
sipping my booze every night.

04:13.681 --> 04:16.048
Onward and upward,
that's what I always say.

04:20.954 --> 04:22.387
Speaking of which...

04:22.488 --> 04:24.957
- I read the prospectus.
- It's a sweet deal, Nuck.

04:25.058 --> 04:28.160
Right on the Gulf, couple
days' sail from the Bahamas.

04:28.261 --> 04:30.863
We off-load on the beach,
truck it anywhere you like.

04:30.964 --> 04:32.697
Sounds the same as Jersey to me.

04:32.798 --> 04:34.599
But with better cigars.

04:34.700 --> 04:37.068
(chuckles)

04:37.169 --> 04:40.905
26 hours in a Pullman, I
bet you'd like to unwind.

04:41.006 --> 04:42.440
Wouldn't say no to a shower.

04:42.541 --> 04:45.076
Go rest. Take a nap.

04:45.177 --> 04:47.712
And if you want something
sweet to go with that stogie,

04:47.812 --> 04:50.447
I'll send a friendly little
cubanita up to your room.

04:50.548 --> 04:52.549
Hot shower will do for now.

04:54.152 --> 04:56.419
- What time later?
- 6:00 P.M.

04:56.520 --> 04:58.655
Speak called Sally's off the inlet.

05:01.359 --> 05:03.060
Nuck.

05:03.161 --> 05:06.062
Tucker's very excited to meet you.

05:06.163 --> 05:09.431
Most people are until they do.

05:09.532 --> 05:10.666
(chuckles)

05:16.339 --> 05:18.908
(crows cawing)

05:19.009 --> 05:20.976
(rooster crowing)

05:47.735 --> 05:49.670
Narcisse: Like all races,

05:49.771 --> 05:53.573
the Libyan race will be
saved by its exceptional men.

05:53.675 --> 05:57.611
Education and work are the
levers to uplift our people.

05:57.712 --> 06:00.880
But work must be guided by intelligence.

06:00.981 --> 06:03.317
And education must teach life.

06:03.418 --> 06:07.421
The new Negro must be tutored
in thought and culture.

06:10.791 --> 06:13.526
We shall continue our discussion next week.

06:16.196 --> 06:18.163
Remember, my brothers,

06:18.264 --> 06:21.166
no man who continues
to add to the material,

06:21.267 --> 06:24.436
intellectual, and moral well-being
of the place in which he lives

06:24.537 --> 06:27.639
is left long without proper reward.

06:30.443 --> 06:32.477
Mr. Madden.

06:44.723 --> 06:46.724
Say hello to Arnold Rothstein.

06:46.825 --> 06:49.793
An honor to have finally
made your acquaintance.

06:51.763 --> 06:53.364
Please.

06:58.469 --> 07:00.870
(clears throat)

07:02.606 --> 07:05.375
Mr. Madden tells me you're
interested in heroin.

07:05.476 --> 07:07.176
As a commodity, yes.

07:07.277 --> 07:09.912
This is a business with
which you are familiar?

07:10.013 --> 07:11.347
One of many.

07:11.448 --> 07:13.515
Biggest fish in Harlem.

07:13.616 --> 07:17.018
However, I do intend to
expand to other Libyan markets.

07:17.119 --> 07:18.453
Libyan?

07:18.554 --> 07:20.422
What he calls the coloreds.

07:22.958 --> 07:26.294
You are a dependable and
amply stocked supplier?

07:26.396 --> 07:29.029
One who requires the utmost discretion.

07:29.130 --> 07:31.399
He's got my vouch like I told you.

07:34.202 --> 07:36.804
20 pounds uncut.

07:36.905 --> 07:39.206
I will weigh it myself
to ensure good measure.

07:40.442 --> 07:42.543
80,000 in cash.

07:42.644 --> 07:44.044
Large bills only.

07:44.145 --> 07:46.613
Why would you expect otherwise?

07:46.714 --> 07:49.416
My understanding you control
the local numbers racket.

07:49.517 --> 07:52.485
Therefore, I transact my
business like a schoolboy

07:52.586 --> 07:54.754
dealing in pennies, nickels, and dimes.

07:54.855 --> 07:56.823
It's not my intention to offend you.

07:56.924 --> 07:59.191
Nonetheless, you
succeeded despite yourself.

07:59.293 --> 08:00.926
(chuckles)

08:01.027 --> 08:02.528
To whom do I dispatch payment?

08:02.629 --> 08:05.431
My associate Mr. Diamond will be in touch.

08:08.067 --> 08:09.902
I have other business with Mr. Madden.

08:11.671 --> 08:13.439
Gentlemen.

08:35.326 --> 08:37.660
Daughter Maitland,

08:37.761 --> 08:39.895
she's been performing at your Cotton Club.

08:39.996 --> 08:42.230
Nice piece of tail.

08:42.332 --> 08:44.600
I will require her services elsewhere.

08:44.701 --> 08:48.471
Fine with me. Just have Dickie
drop by with a replacement.

08:48.572 --> 08:52.174
God will bring every deed to judgment,

08:52.275 --> 08:54.409
with every secret thing,

08:54.511 --> 08:57.011
either good or evil.

09:02.618 --> 09:04.853
Mr. Pastor will not be returning.

09:07.122 --> 09:10.324
He's got it all worked
out. The world's expert.

09:10.425 --> 09:14.094
Two miles of road to pave
and cash on the barrelhead.

09:14.195 --> 09:16.797
So you know what I told him, Rick?

09:16.898 --> 09:19.633
I said, "What you want
is the Piedmont gravel."

09:19.734 --> 09:21.434
He wasn't having any of it.

09:21.536 --> 09:24.938
Four tons of creek rock, and now
the whole order needs to be redone.

09:25.039 --> 09:26.507
How frustrating.

09:26.608 --> 09:29.208
No skin off me, but a man's
got to know his business.

09:29.309 --> 09:31.010
Don't he, Rick?

09:31.111 --> 09:34.146
He sure do, Hube.

09:38.351 --> 09:41.186
Say, how's Saturday?

09:41.287 --> 09:44.189
Okay. I'll drive up after we close.

09:44.290 --> 09:47.291
Get started on clearing out that barn.

09:47.393 --> 09:49.227
Richard said he'll do it,

09:49.328 --> 09:51.029
so there's no need.

09:51.130 --> 09:53.131
Heck, I don't mind, Emmy.

09:53.232 --> 09:55.366
Truth to tell, I enjoy the company.

09:55.467 --> 09:57.636
Why don't you call first?

09:57.737 --> 10:00.971
These are for the drive back to town.

10:01.072 --> 10:03.607
Keep feeding me and I'll come back.

10:04.943 --> 10:07.210
Stray dogs and bachelors, eh, Rick?

10:07.311 --> 10:09.713
Mmm.

10:09.814 --> 10:12.349
Well, see you in the funnies.

10:18.656 --> 10:20.657
I would have picked the pea gravel.

10:20.758 --> 10:23.292
Could have gone with the river run.

10:23.393 --> 10:25.628
That's a nice bit of rock, Emmy.

10:25.729 --> 10:29.098
- (laughs)
- (Horn honks)

10:29.199 --> 10:31.367
He's not so bad,

10:31.468 --> 10:32.868
is he?

10:32.969 --> 10:35.571
As a brother-in-law?

10:40.276 --> 10:42.978
(sighs)

10:43.079 --> 10:45.313
He lost someone too, you know.

10:45.414 --> 10:48.016
And his folks, they're good people.

10:48.117 --> 10:51.986
They wanted me to move into
town with them after Gerry died.

10:56.491 --> 10:58.325
You can have our old room.

10:58.426 --> 11:00.995
I'll set up in Mother and Father's.

11:01.096 --> 11:02.496
Needs painting.

11:02.598 --> 11:04.364
Well, add it to your chores.

11:07.902 --> 11:10.136
Some curtains, maybe.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.472
And a hobbyhorse.

11:12.573 --> 11:15.174
Make it a proper nursery.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.545
The crib's stored out in the barn.

11:19.647 --> 11:22.047
I'd fetch it myself, but...

11:25.952 --> 11:27.620
I haven't asked you for any...

11:27.721 --> 11:29.321
Just take it.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.523
Take it and pay the taxes.

11:31.591 --> 11:33.158
The what?

11:33.159 --> 11:36.028
The back taxes. I saw the letter.

11:36.635 --> 11:38.395
That's enough to cover it.

11:38.497 --> 11:40.464
I paid the taxes.

11:40.565 --> 11:42.600
I sold the Hudson and I paid them.

11:42.701 --> 11:45.436
The assessor rang. He said...

11:45.537 --> 11:47.105
Is this Mr. Case?

11:47.205 --> 11:49.007
He didn't give a name.

11:49.108 --> 11:51.175
Well, I'm not paying them twice.

11:52.810 --> 11:56.346
Put that money away and let's
not talk about it. All right?

11:57.649 --> 11:59.950
- (thunder rumbling)
- (Music playing)

12:00.051 --> 12:02.853
- (wind blowing)
- (People chatting)

12:08.892 --> 12:12.194
This land is opportunity and you can
double your investment in a month,

12:12.295 --> 12:14.797
especially with the rail road expanding.

12:18.068 --> 12:20.870
Just last week there was a
shipping clerk from Syracuse...

12:20.971 --> 12:22.571
never left the train station.

12:22.673 --> 12:24.173
Sold his deed in the washroom,

12:24.274 --> 12:27.308
headed back north on the
next train 15,000 to the good.

12:27.409 --> 12:29.243
- (whistles)
- I'll tell you, Mr. Logan,

12:29.344 --> 12:31.079
you will not be sorry.

12:31.180 --> 12:33.048
Thanks, buddy.

12:36.485 --> 12:37.986
Quite a racket.

12:38.087 --> 12:40.321
It's a Bancroft.

12:40.422 --> 12:41.922
I was talking about the real estate game.

12:43.058 --> 12:46.426
Say, can any Joe buy in?

12:46.527 --> 12:48.295
Well, sure, if he's got the dough.

12:48.396 --> 12:50.597
Just so happens I'm selling
lots in Pineapple Grove.

12:50.699 --> 12:52.399
Hottest new development in Tampa.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.301
Is that so?

12:54.402 --> 12:58.204
Say, that shipping clerk who
sold his deed in the washroom,

12:58.305 --> 13:01.107
did he wipe the shit off his
hands before he signed it?

13:01.208 --> 13:03.943
(chuckles)

13:04.044 --> 13:05.277
A wise guy, huh?

13:05.378 --> 13:08.114
- Call me Nucky.
- Skeeter Walsh.

13:08.215 --> 13:09.716
Skeeter?

13:09.817 --> 13:12.851
Well, Pop said I was
always buzzing around, so...

13:12.952 --> 13:15.320
Not that you're a bloodsucker?

13:15.421 --> 13:18.156
No offense, but I've mm.

13:18.257 --> 13:20.759
Well, what we've got sells itself.

13:20.860 --> 13:22.560
Swampland at 100 bucks an acre.

13:22.661 --> 13:24.596
We're only giving people what they want.

13:24.697 --> 13:27.398
I know a little about that myself.

13:28.601 --> 13:31.635
Again. And for my friend here as well.

13:32.971 --> 13:35.305
Lighter on the blood, heavier on the Mary.

13:38.110 --> 13:40.044
So how's this all work?

13:40.145 --> 13:43.347
I'm buying the drinks here,
so give it to me square.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.148
(chuckles)

13:45.249 --> 13:48.084
Well, me and the other
fellas, we're Binder Boys, see?

13:48.185 --> 13:50.519
We take the deposits, the binders.

13:50.621 --> 13:52.722
- It's 10% usually.
- Of the purchase price?

13:52.823 --> 13:54.924
Which is enough to hold the property.

13:55.025 --> 13:57.193
It's booming down here
since Temple Terrace opened.

13:57.294 --> 13:59.528
- And that's just the beginning.
- You don't say.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.196
There's three more developments coming.

14:01.297 --> 14:04.266
Country clubs, golf courses,
80 miles of paved streets.

14:04.367 --> 14:06.902
Not to mention
quarter-million-dollar Roman pools.

14:07.003 --> 14:08.470
And the buyers are lining up?

14:08.571 --> 14:11.606
Put it this way... last year
there were nine Binder Boys.

14:11.707 --> 14:14.442
This year, 74.

14:14.543 --> 14:16.411
(thunder crashing)

14:16.512 --> 14:19.580
Russell Conwell: I say
that you ought to get rich,

14:19.681 --> 14:22.183
it is your duty to get rich.

14:22.284 --> 14:25.686
The men who get rich may
be the most honest men

14:25.788 --> 14:28.089
you find in the community.

14:28.190 --> 14:30.892
That is why they are rich.

14:30.993 --> 14:33.794
- (laughing, whispering)
- That is why they are trusted with money.

14:33.895 --> 14:38.331
- Woman: Stop. Shh. Shh.
- That is why they carry on great enterprises

14:38.432 --> 14:41.868
and find plenty of
people to work with them.

14:41.969 --> 14:45.038
A man is not really a true man

14:45.139 --> 14:47.841
until he owns his own home.

14:47.942 --> 14:50.442
And they that own their own homes

14:50.543 --> 14:55.714
are made more honorable
and honest and pure.

14:55.816 --> 14:57.883
- Bucket.
- Hey, Henry.

14:57.984 --> 15:00.319
What's this woofy?

15:00.420 --> 15:02.587
A speech by old man Conwell.

15:02.689 --> 15:05.290
Sap sells his farm to go look for diamonds

15:05.390 --> 15:07.425
when all along his own
place is lousy with them.

15:07.526 --> 15:09.593
Henry: Well, ain't that ironical?

15:09.695 --> 15:11.462
Say, who's gonna butt me?

15:16.535 --> 15:18.903
- (boys snicker)
- Got a Lucky?

15:19.004 --> 15:21.004
Sure, Bucket.

15:22.073 --> 15:23.506
Only my pals call me Bucket.

15:23.607 --> 15:26.076
(boys laugh)

15:30.381 --> 15:33.783
Say, nobody told me Colleen
Moore enrolled in school.

15:33.885 --> 15:36.486
Brother, can you lay it on thick.

15:36.587 --> 15:39.421
(boys laugh)

15:39.522 --> 15:41.924
You sit behind me in English lit.

15:43.560 --> 15:46.562
So, tonight after lights out,

15:46.663 --> 15:48.197
we've got some Paul Whiteman records

15:48.298 --> 15:50.233
and we are gonna dust off that Victrola.

15:50.334 --> 15:51.901
Doris and I already have plans.

15:52.002 --> 15:54.236
With some juniors from Penn Sigma Chi.

15:54.337 --> 15:57.272
- Those bums are all wet.
- Wet is why we're going.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.773
Well, we have plenty of giggle juice.

15:58.875 --> 16:01.109
Actually, we don't.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.778
Well, that settles that, then, doesn't it?

16:03.880 --> 16:05.380
Maybe next time.

16:06.515 --> 16:07.715
I can get some.

16:07.816 --> 16:09.516
Some what?

16:09.617 --> 16:11.218
Some booze.

16:11.319 --> 16:12.953
Like fun you can.

16:13.054 --> 16:16.156
No, really. I... I know someone.

16:17.859 --> 16:19.459
So, tonight, then?

16:19.560 --> 16:20.995
The basement?

16:21.096 --> 16:24.698
Well, then, it's a date.

16:24.799 --> 16:28.401
Conwell: He will be great anywhere.

16:28.502 --> 16:30.703
- (boys laugh)
- I sympathize with the poor,

16:30.804 --> 16:32.805
but let us remember...

16:32.907 --> 16:35.574
- (imitates gorilla)
- ... there is not a poor person in America,

16:35.675 --> 16:39.879
the United States, who was not made poor

16:39.980 --> 16:42.847
by his own shortcomings.

16:42.949 --> 16:45.951
- (faint music playing)
- (Clock ticking)

16:53.026 --> 16:56.395
It's clean, relatively.

16:56.495 --> 16:59.964
Certainly spacious enough
to fit a bachelor's needs.

17:02.067 --> 17:04.501
Half expect to see Sherlock
Holmes come through the door.

17:04.602 --> 17:06.770
(laughs) You're not convinced.

17:10.041 --> 17:12.410
The windows face west.

17:12.510 --> 17:15.845
It'll be like the Sahara come 4:00 P.M.

17:15.946 --> 17:17.948
Then again, I would be at the office.

17:18.049 --> 17:20.416
Are you always so indecisive?

17:20.517 --> 17:24.287
Not in business, but personally, yeah.

17:24.387 --> 17:26.756
It's endearing.

17:26.857 --> 17:28.191
Clara found it maddening.

17:28.291 --> 17:30.659
Well, Clara was wrong.

17:41.804 --> 17:45.440
You know, I wonder, uh...

17:45.540 --> 17:48.209
- Yes?
- Well...

17:48.310 --> 17:50.078
Another moment of indecision?

17:52.314 --> 17:54.282
This evening...

17:57.086 --> 18:01.188
a man named Hewson, big
Ike in the A&P chain,

18:01.289 --> 18:03.223
rather old-fashioned from what I hear,

18:03.324 --> 18:05.192
he's in town with his wife.

18:05.293 --> 18:07.794
I'm supposed to meet them for dinner.

18:07.895 --> 18:09.963
Oh?

18:10.064 --> 18:12.165
You're not making this easy.

18:13.468 --> 18:15.602
Are you asking me to join you?

18:15.703 --> 18:17.169
Well, yes.

18:17.270 --> 18:19.372
But, you see, it's very
important it go well.

18:19.473 --> 18:22.641
He... he thinks I'm still married.

18:22.742 --> 18:24.477
You've never met?

18:24.577 --> 18:26.379
No, I've spoken to him on the phone.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.747
If he finds out that I'm divorcing...

18:28.848 --> 18:32.184
You want me to pretend to be your wife?

18:33.785 --> 18:36.521
That's not something a
gentleman would ask of a lady.

18:37.589 --> 18:40.858
Well, you didn't even have to.

18:43.094 --> 18:46.430
So, what do we think?

18:46.531 --> 18:48.532
Uh...

18:48.633 --> 18:50.767
I'm sorry.

18:50.868 --> 18:52.936
These rooms won't do.

18:53.038 --> 18:55.705
(piano playing)

19:00.277 --> 19:02.745
(playing)

19:02.846 --> 19:04.680
Chalky: Check the champagne order

19:04.781 --> 19:06.749
and get me 10 extra four-tops.

19:06.850 --> 19:08.717
Got that car convention in town.

19:08.818 --> 19:10.653
Got busboys for that.

19:10.754 --> 19:12.355
Shit float downhill, buck.

19:12.456 --> 19:14.523
Don't matter to me none where it stop.

19:35.009 --> 19:37.678
Mr. White. Mr. Purnsley.

19:39.581 --> 19:41.882
Them tables ain't gonna set theyself.

19:47.288 --> 19:48.854
Doctor.

19:48.956 --> 19:51.857
May I present Miss Daughter Maitland.

19:51.959 --> 19:54.194
Say hello, dear.

19:54.295 --> 19:56.096
Mr. White.

19:56.197 --> 19:57.997
Pleased to meet you.

19:59.100 --> 20:01.067
Miss Maitland is a very gifted singer.

20:01.167 --> 20:04.803
Equally accomplished in
jazz improvisation and blues.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.338
Sang on a record.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.740
"Warsaw Blues" with King Oliver.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.375
You know your business, sir.

20:10.477 --> 20:12.444
I know what Dickie Pastor held back.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.346
Behind the stage past the kitchen,

20:14.447 --> 20:16.915
you'll find a dressing room
where you can put your things.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.893
- She's a pretty girl.
- She is indeed.

20:31.463 --> 20:33.063
So what's she doing here?

20:33.164 --> 20:35.465
Performing for the week.

20:35.566 --> 20:37.734
I do hope you asking and not telling.

20:37.835 --> 20:39.902
We are partners, Mr. White,

20:40.004 --> 20:41.871
and that girl is a star.

20:41.972 --> 20:44.374
If you will have her.

20:46.177 --> 20:47.677
All right, then.

20:51.248 --> 20:53.249
Keep that walkway clear now.

20:58.688 --> 21:00.389
It was my understanding

21:00.490 --> 21:03.125
that Mr. Purnsley managed the staff.

21:03.226 --> 21:04.860
He do as I tell him.

21:06.962 --> 21:09.930
When men make themselves into brutes,

21:10.032 --> 21:12.733
it is just to treat them as brutes.

21:29.551 --> 21:31.218
Stop fidgeting.

21:34.222 --> 21:36.056
That man has a shotgun.

21:37.224 --> 21:38.357
Wait here.

21:38.458 --> 21:40.459
No, I'm not staying out here alone.

21:44.331 --> 21:46.365
Mickey: This is supposed
to be a food truck, Larry.

21:46.466 --> 21:49.735
The way them springs sag, it's pretty
obvious it ain't hauling bananas.

21:51.271 --> 21:52.938
You boys lose your Scout troop?

21:53.039 --> 21:54.839
Willie Thompson. Eli's son.

21:54.940 --> 21:56.308
You're Mickey, right?

21:58.311 --> 22:00.312
I... I'm Eli's son.

22:00.413 --> 22:02.447
We've met before, a few years ago.

22:04.817 --> 22:06.451
Well, I'm away at college now.

22:06.552 --> 22:08.152
Boola-boola.

22:08.254 --> 22:09.687
That's Yale. We go to Temple.

22:09.787 --> 22:11.622
Funny. You don't look Jewish.

22:11.723 --> 22:13.924
(laughs)

22:14.025 --> 22:16.827
So we were hoping to get some booze.

22:16.928 --> 22:19.663
Oh, you were, huh? How
about we call your pop?

22:19.764 --> 22:21.098
See what he thinks about that?

22:21.199 --> 22:22.766
- No, no, I just...
- Take a hike, kid.

22:22.867 --> 22:25.202
- I need it for a party.
- Are you deaf?

22:25.302 --> 22:26.869
Or just stupid?

22:26.970 --> 22:29.004
All right.

22:29.106 --> 22:30.840
Okay.

22:30.941 --> 22:32.742
Sorry.

22:32.843 --> 22:35.712
Don't let the door hit you in the brains.

22:41.817 --> 22:43.218
What are you doing?

22:43.319 --> 22:45.987
That's what they say, yeah.

22:46.088 --> 22:47.822
Hey! Where are you going?

22:47.923 --> 22:49.891
Nowhere. Mr. Doyle just...

22:49.992 --> 22:51.826
Hey, Mick, you okay this?

22:55.131 --> 22:58.065
What the fuck I say, huh?

22:58.166 --> 23:00.134
- Fucking thief!
- I'm sorry.

23:00.235 --> 23:03.304
- What, was this your idea?
- No, sir.

23:04.373 --> 23:07.241
I'm calling your father right now.

23:07.342 --> 23:09.076
No, no, Mr. Doyle, please.

23:09.177 --> 23:11.712
My dad said he'd kill me if
I got in trouble like this.

23:11.813 --> 23:13.580
- I mean, my mother would have...
- All right.

23:13.681 --> 23:15.815
Don't get so dramatic.

23:22.456 --> 23:24.291
Can't go around robbing people.

23:26.460 --> 23:29.228
It's a good thing your
dad's my pal. Now scat.

23:33.767 --> 23:35.701
And we'll keep this between us, okay?

23:35.803 --> 23:36.969
Man-to-man.

23:37.070 --> 23:39.906
And not a word about any of this, capisce?

23:45.179 --> 23:47.245
Take the booze, kid.

23:50.316 --> 23:51.649
Go ahead.

23:57.589 --> 23:59.357
Thank you.

25:04.286 --> 25:06.887
(bird calls)

25:14.561 --> 25:17.463
(bird calls)

25:21.535 --> 25:23.969
(bird calls)

25:31.978 --> 25:34.546
(bird calls)

25:35.748 --> 25:39.083
(wings fluttering)

25:48.593 --> 25:52.263
Here's something you actually accomplished.

25:58.036 --> 26:00.904
Remember me? Carl Billings?

26:02.373 --> 26:05.642
We met on a train last summer.

26:07.245 --> 26:09.079
Do you or don't you?

26:09.180 --> 26:11.314
I remember.

26:13.050 --> 26:15.151
You agreed to take on a certain job.

26:15.252 --> 26:17.653
Something you knew how to do.

26:17.754 --> 26:20.289
As I recall,

26:20.390 --> 26:23.926
you said it was the one thing
on Earth you were good at.

26:24.027 --> 26:28.529
And I said half now, half when you finish.

26:28.630 --> 26:30.498
But you didn't finish.

26:30.599 --> 26:34.169
You left a man alive,
which makes me concerned

26:34.270 --> 26:36.904
about a conversation we had

26:37.006 --> 26:39.574
on the train

26:39.675 --> 26:41.276
last summer.

26:53.121 --> 26:54.455
Just a wallet.

27:01.261 --> 27:04.197
What's this?

27:04.298 --> 27:06.432
You haven't touched it.

27:06.533 --> 27:10.970
This makes you honest?

27:11.071 --> 27:13.506
You don't have any kind of a code.

27:13.607 --> 27:15.673
You kill for hire.

27:15.774 --> 27:18.743
And this just makes you stupid.

27:19.945 --> 27:22.981
And how do you trust a stupid man?

27:25.218 --> 27:28.153
- Well?
- (Wings fluttering)

27:28.254 --> 27:30.154
(gasps)

27:35.394 --> 27:37.794
- (crunches)
- (Groans)

27:40.765 --> 27:44.001
(panting)

27:44.102 --> 27:46.102
Jesus.

27:46.203 --> 27:48.638
I'm doing you a favor.

27:48.739 --> 27:50.973
(gunshot)

28:09.426 --> 28:11.626
- (people chatting)
- (Thunder rumbling)

28:11.727 --> 28:13.828
(music playing)

28:16.732 --> 28:18.632
(chuckles)

28:18.733 --> 28:22.136
Next time you might want to
consider a life preserver.

28:24.206 --> 28:25.806
So much for always sunny.

28:25.907 --> 28:27.942
Into each life some rain must fall.

28:28.043 --> 28:30.978
And in Tampa, that's at least once a day.

28:31.080 --> 28:33.181
- August Tucker.
- They call you Gus?

28:33.282 --> 28:35.148
Not if they want to stay friends.

28:36.150 --> 28:37.750
Sit.

28:37.851 --> 28:39.519
Nucky Thompson.

28:39.620 --> 28:41.721
Well, hell, I know that.

28:41.822 --> 28:44.724
Bill here told me all about you.

28:44.825 --> 28:46.459
- Is that right?
- Bill: We met back in '20

28:46.560 --> 28:48.494
when I was doing those rum
runs up from the Caribbean.

28:48.596 --> 28:51.297
In the good old, bad old
days before the feds got wise.

28:51.398 --> 28:53.066
Bill: Who you telling?

28:54.534 --> 28:55.935
To new friends and old.

28:56.036 --> 28:58.637
Well, hang on, now. I
want to be friends, too.

29:03.409 --> 29:06.078
Leave that bottle and scat.

29:13.119 --> 29:15.219
- So.
- So.

29:21.026 --> 29:23.828
Ready to get rich?

29:23.929 --> 29:25.696
I'm already rich, Mr. Tucker.

29:25.797 --> 29:27.431
But I'm talking millions.

29:27.532 --> 29:29.199
What good would millions do me in jail?

29:30.768 --> 29:32.201
Come again?

29:32.302 --> 29:34.270
You agree, I assume, that our business

29:34.371 --> 29:36.405
requires a certain degree of secrecy?

29:36.507 --> 29:38.041
Naturally, sure.

29:38.142 --> 29:40.076
Then this land is worthless.

29:41.977 --> 29:42.345
- What?
- But, Nuck...

29:42.446 --> 29:44.748
Nucky: The entire surrounding
area is being developed.

29:44.849 --> 29:47.582
Houses, country clubs, schools.

29:47.684 --> 29:50.218
But it's 14,000 acres.

29:50.319 --> 29:53.155
We'd still control enough land
that we'd off-load in total privacy.

29:53.256 --> 29:55.090
And when the convoy of
trucks leaves the property

29:55.191 --> 29:57.760
every morning and rumbles down
Main Street past the church,

29:57.861 --> 30:00.029
- then what?
- Well...

30:00.130 --> 30:02.429
there's a risk in everything, Nuck.

30:02.531 --> 30:04.032
Not when I can avoid it.

30:06.068 --> 30:09.070
- You told me he was in.
- He was.

30:09.171 --> 30:11.906
I mean, I thought he...

30:12.007 --> 30:14.642
I said that I'd consider it. And I did.

30:16.578 --> 30:18.845
Then you were told wrong, Mr. Tucker.

30:23.818 --> 30:25.418
Nucky, please.

30:25.519 --> 30:27.320
We got the seller right where we want him.

30:27.421 --> 30:29.255
Sorry, boys.

30:29.356 --> 30:31.158
You'll have to find
yourselves a new partner.

30:31.258 --> 30:33.759
I don't like having my time wasted.

30:33.860 --> 30:36.295
You're not the one who
came all the way down here.

30:42.502 --> 30:45.004
Thanks for your hospitality.

Quite the chanteuse.

31:44.261 --> 31:45.861
We have nothing like that back home.

31:45.962 --> 31:47.529
And where is home, Helen?

31:47.631 --> 31:50.065
Evansville, Indiana. Ever heard of it?

31:50.166 --> 31:52.635
(music playing)

31:52.736 --> 31:54.403
I can't say I have.

31:54.504 --> 31:57.472
We'll have to visit for our anniversary.

32:00.743 --> 32:04.045
Roy tells me that you're thinking
of merging with Piggly Wiggly.

32:04.147 --> 32:06.014
Oh, he does, does he?

32:07.483 --> 32:09.484
Was I not supposed to say that?

32:09.585 --> 32:11.752
No, no, that's fine. It's
not exactly a national secret.

32:11.853 --> 32:15.023
Let's just wait till the
deal closes, shall we?

32:16.105 --> 32:18.725
Come on, have some coffee.
It'll settle your nerves.

32:18.827 --> 32:21.095
That coffee will get us all thrown in jail.

32:21.196 --> 32:23.730
Oh, what's the harm?

32:23.832 --> 32:26.733
Your wife always so eager to break the law?

32:26.834 --> 32:29.269
Oh, she's incorrigible.

32:29.369 --> 32:31.171
Me? You're the one who tried

32:31.272 --> 32:33.039
to marry me when I was still underage.

32:33.140 --> 32:36.109
(Hewson laughs) Can't blame him for that.

32:36.210 --> 32:38.778
I, for one, need some coffee.

32:40.014 --> 32:42.948
What the heck? (laughs)

32:45.584 --> 32:47.352
Pardon me.

32:47.453 --> 32:48.921
I'm going to powder my nose.

32:49.022 --> 32:50.355
I'll join you.

32:50.456 --> 32:53.792
* Down Alabamy way *

32:53.893 --> 32:56.261
* I just can picture Black Joe *

32:56.362 --> 32:57.896
* With his old banjo *

32:57.997 --> 33:01.366
♪ I can hear him strumming a tune ♪

33:01.467 --> 33:04.302
* That old quartet,
I can hear them yet *

33:04.403 --> 33:06.671
* Singing by the silvery moon *

33:06.772 --> 33:08.807
* Don't got a thing to burn... *

33:08.907 --> 33:11.576
Well, was I lying?

33:11.677 --> 33:13.778
The white folks seem to like her.

33:13.879 --> 33:15.346
Yes.

33:15.447 --> 33:17.914
That would be very important.

33:24.922 --> 33:26.824
To you.

33:29.527 --> 33:31.662
(music playing)

33:32.696 --> 33:35.966
Some ferocious guard dogs and a few fellas

33:36.067 --> 33:38.335
with shotguns.

33:38.435 --> 33:40.904
- But nothing to concern yourself...
- Thanks a lot.

33:43.507 --> 33:45.308
Man: I am just bored out of my mind,

33:45.409 --> 33:47.077
then suddenly...

33:50.046 --> 33:52.047
Great party, Thompson.

33:52.148 --> 33:53.282
So where'd you get all this stuff?

33:53.383 --> 33:54.917
- I bet he nicked it.
- Don't be stupid.

33:55.018 --> 33:56.418
Not a wise head like Thompson.

33:56.519 --> 33:58.354
- Hey, ho. Hey. Hey.
- Watch my shoe.

33:58.454 --> 34:02.024
So, you pick the ladies tonight or what?

34:02.125 --> 34:04.192
Once they start drinking, we all do.

34:04.293 --> 34:07.161
Thompson to the rescue.
Where'd you get this stuff?

34:07.263 --> 34:09.597
- A friend.
- Oh, you got some friends?

34:09.697 --> 34:11.498
Tip: You're my hero,
Thompson. You know that?

34:11.600 --> 34:13.134
Dirk: This kid's been laughing at himself.

34:13.235 --> 34:15.103
- Having his first drink.
- Hey.

34:15.204 --> 34:18.273
Look at him. Think he's a hotshot now.

34:18.373 --> 34:20.806
- Thompson saved the day, so...
- That's right.

34:20.909 --> 34:23.342
- Congratulations.
- Come on, Henry.

34:23.444 --> 34:26.013
- Cut it out. Henry.
- Anyway, a toast to Thompson.

34:26.114 --> 34:27.580
- To Thompson.
- To Thompson.

34:27.681 --> 34:29.382
- Our boy.
- You're my hero.

34:29.483 --> 34:31.583
Henry, quit it!

34:32.652 --> 34:34.021
Easy, Henry.

34:34.121 --> 34:35.621
Mind your business, Thompson.

34:35.723 --> 34:38.623
That's for Doris to decide.

34:38.725 --> 34:41.360
I'd like to leave now. Walk me?

34:41.460 --> 34:43.362
Sure.

34:43.463 --> 34:46.299
Let's beat it, then, shall we?

34:50.737 --> 34:52.536
(boys laughing)

34:54.172 --> 34:56.908
Sure, Doris, go slumming.

35:04.350 --> 35:07.052
Wait. I want to show you something.

35:07.153 --> 35:09.353
In the library.

35:32.009 --> 35:33.242
(thunder rumbling)

35:33.344 --> 35:35.811
I owe this man.

35:35.912 --> 35:38.581
- Owe him what?
- Money.

35:38.682 --> 35:40.515
A lot of it.

35:40.616 --> 35:42.451
When I was arrested,

35:42.551 --> 35:44.353
had my ships confiscated...

35:44.454 --> 35:47.356
It was his scotch on board.

35:48.657 --> 35:50.025
How much?

35:51.127 --> 35:53.462
Almost 200 grand.

35:53.562 --> 35:57.131
He was there waiting the
day I got out of jail.

35:57.232 --> 35:58.832
He was the first thing I saw

35:58.933 --> 36:01.035
when my eyes adjusted to the sunlight.

36:01.136 --> 36:03.270
If you needed money, why
didn't you just ask me?

36:03.372 --> 36:04.771
Because I wanted to earn it.

36:04.873 --> 36:07.274
I'm not some goddamn charity case.

36:07.376 --> 36:08.642
Earn it?

36:08.743 --> 36:10.444
He said if I made the intro,

36:10.545 --> 36:13.013
got you involved as his partner,

36:13.114 --> 36:14.381
he'd forgive the debt.

36:14.482 --> 36:15.781
I'm supposed to partner

36:15.883 --> 36:17.617
with some two-bit fucking hillbilly?

36:17.718 --> 36:20.253
He's a big man around these parts.

36:20.354 --> 36:22.822
I've already met the world's tallest
midget on the midway back home.

36:22.923 --> 36:25.658
He's got the locals in his pocket.

36:25.759 --> 36:27.660
All the things you're worried about.

36:27.761 --> 36:30.562
- He could pave the road...
- The deal is shit.

36:30.663 --> 36:32.498
And you know it.

36:34.800 --> 36:37.503
(scoffs)

36:37.603 --> 36:40.139
The fuck am I gonna do?

36:42.808 --> 36:44.708
You made your bed, Bill.

36:47.979 --> 36:50.114
I thought you were my friend.

36:54.453 --> 36:57.121
If you had come to me like
one, it'd be different.

36:58.890 --> 37:02.559
Train tickets. Stupid coconut drinks.

37:02.660 --> 37:05.862
All your syrupy fucking sales talk.

37:05.963 --> 37:09.533
I was desperate, Nuck.

37:09.633 --> 37:11.535
I'm sorry.

37:11.635 --> 37:13.736
I made a mistake.

37:15.139 --> 37:16.939
Well, look at you now.

37:29.586 --> 37:32.853
(door opens, closes)

37:38.927 --> 37:41.596
(music playing)

37:45.734 --> 37:47.935
Roy: Where were you married?
When were you married?

37:48.036 --> 37:50.704
- Talk about an inquest.
- You got off easy.

37:50.805 --> 37:54.174
I was about to invent a brood of
six and have you name them all.

37:54.275 --> 37:55.675
Six?

37:55.776 --> 37:57.211
Someone's got a wicked streak.

37:57.312 --> 38:00.347
Me? You're the one planning
our anniversary trip.

38:00.448 --> 38:03.617
To Mudville, sure. Wherever they're from.

38:06.686 --> 38:08.588
Mmm.

38:08.688 --> 38:10.556
A nickel for your thoughts.

38:10.657 --> 38:13.259
I pay better than most people.

38:13.360 --> 38:15.861
I was thinking

38:15.962 --> 38:17.997
we make a pretty swell team.

38:23.336 --> 38:25.337
Excuse me, ma'am.

38:25.438 --> 38:26.838
Yes?

38:26.939 --> 38:28.806
I beg your pardon, but we...

38:28.907 --> 38:30.708
I don't mean to intrude.

38:30.809 --> 38:33.044
We've met before.

38:33.146 --> 38:34.546
I'm sorry, I don't...

38:34.647 --> 38:36.980
My friend Roger, about a year ago,

38:37.081 --> 38:39.350
outside the restaurant Abe
Klein's on the boardwalk.

38:40.519 --> 38:42.352
Say, what's this all about?

38:42.453 --> 38:44.720
I really couldn't say.

38:44.821 --> 38:47.056
You introduced yourself, gave him a smoke.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.658
- I'm sure you're mistaken.
- I beg your pardon?

38:48.759 --> 38:50.560
I'm sure it was you.

38:50.661 --> 38:54.096
He said something about going
to your house for Easter.

38:54.198 --> 38:56.799
- And then he did a...
- This person is making me very uncomfortable.

38:56.900 --> 38:58.634
- All right, that's enough.
- Sorry, mister.

38:58.734 --> 39:00.869
Hey, take it on the arches, son.

39:11.747 --> 39:14.448
The heck was that all about?

39:14.550 --> 39:16.517
I have no idea.

39:19.621 --> 39:22.690
Excuse me. I need the ladies'.

39:33.401 --> 39:35.235
(knocks)

39:37.371 --> 39:39.072
(doorknob rattles)

39:39.173 --> 39:41.241
Just a moment.

39:45.913 --> 39:48.914
(music playing)

39:55.955 --> 39:58.957
(music playing louder)

40:10.569 --> 40:12.437
(door opens)

40:33.791 --> 40:35.358
You okay?

40:35.459 --> 40:37.926
I'm fine, yes.

40:38.027 --> 40:39.828
I just...

40:45.902 --> 40:48.203
It melted.

41:02.385 --> 41:04.653
Oh, your lip.

41:38.918 --> 41:40.885

- Come on, sport.

41:40.986 --> 41:42.688
(gasps)

41:44.123 --> 41:46.257
Touch me again, I'll break your nose.

41:49.362 --> 41:53.097
Well, it looks like your anger's
not the only thing that's arisen.

41:53.199 --> 41:55.366
(laughing)

41:56.702 --> 41:59.102
Girl: It's Thompson's Willie.

42:36.840 --> 42:42.345
* She felt much better
in her daddy's arms... *

42:42.445 --> 42:45.446
Is he alive?

42:45.547 --> 42:47.682
Well, he's breathing.

42:47.783 --> 42:50.051
Alive is a matter of opinion.

42:51.354 --> 42:52.787
Does it ever stop raining?

42:52.889 --> 42:55.090
It always has.

42:58.994 --> 43:00.794
So how about you?

43:00.896 --> 43:02.596
Are you alive?

43:03.765 --> 43:05.766
I recall that I was once.

43:05.867 --> 43:07.768
What happened?

43:10.372 --> 43:12.039
Prohibition.

43:13.308 --> 43:15.341
Till then, I was a simple,

43:15.442 --> 43:18.244
run-of-the-mill crook...
a corrupt city official.

43:18.345 --> 43:19.946
And I was happy.

43:20.047 --> 43:23.416
Plenty of money, plenty of friends,

43:23.517 --> 43:25.851
plenty of everything.

43:25.953 --> 43:28.187
Then suddenly, plenty wasn't enough.

43:28.289 --> 43:30.589
Well, I ain't buying it.

43:30.690 --> 43:31.990
How do you mean?

43:32.091 --> 43:35.027
Anybody who says money
doesn't buy happiness

43:35.128 --> 43:37.129
doesn't know where to shop.

43:38.531 --> 43:40.332
So I hear.

43:46.339 --> 43:48.339
My son's birthday tomorrow.

43:48.440 --> 43:49.873
Name's Teddy.

43:49.975 --> 43:51.976
How old?

43:53.511 --> 43:56.213
- 10?
- You don't know?

43:56.315 --> 43:57.714
He's no longer with me.

43:57.816 --> 43:59.850
I'm sorry.

43:59.952 --> 44:03.019
Oh, he's not dead. He's in Brooklyn.

44:03.120 --> 44:06.789
(chuckles) There's that
matter of opinion again.

44:10.094 --> 44:11.627
Rain's over.

44:11.728 --> 44:14.164
I've been meaning to send him something.

44:14.265 --> 44:16.333
- Who?
- My son.

44:17.969 --> 44:19.634
Hmm.

44:19.735 --> 44:22.571
Maybe the better gift
is to let him forget me.

44:24.240 --> 44:26.241
Well, that's convenient.

44:26.343 --> 44:27.742
Beg pardon?

44:27.844 --> 44:29.378
That the best choice requires

44:29.479 --> 44:31.380
the least amount of effort on your part.

44:31.481 --> 44:34.183
I thought bartenders were
supposed to be sympathetic.

44:34.284 --> 44:37.518
(laughs) Welcome to Sally's.

44:37.619 --> 44:39.287
That you?

44:40.689 --> 44:43.424
- Sally Wheet.
- Nucky Thompson.

44:43.525 --> 44:44.959
I know all about it.

44:45.060 --> 44:47.095
You're all Tucker's talked about for weeks.

44:47.196 --> 44:50.564
Big man in these parts, so I hear.

44:50.665 --> 44:52.265
He thinks so.

44:56.604 --> 44:59.272
Give me one of those and I'll dish.

44:59.374 --> 45:02.009
- Gee, you're easy.
- (Laughs)

45:02.110 --> 45:04.677
* Rock me, pretty papa *

45:04.778 --> 45:09.348
* While I tell you what to do... *

45:10.350 --> 45:12.218
August Tucker,

45:12.319 --> 45:14.387
Georgia native, son of moonshiners.

45:14.488 --> 45:16.389
Made his way to Tampa after the war.

45:16.490 --> 45:19.458
How long before he discovered you?

45:21.128 --> 45:22.828
We're friends.

45:22.929 --> 45:24.862
We do a little business on occasion.

45:24.963 --> 45:26.831
Is he dangerous?

45:29.568 --> 45:31.036
He's kind of like this fella.

45:31.137 --> 45:34.239
He'd kill you if he got a chance,

45:34.340 --> 45:36.707
but he's not very smart, either.

45:36.808 --> 45:40.577
So how does a not-so-smart
semi-dangerous man

45:40.678 --> 45:42.312
run the rackets down in Tampa?

45:42.414 --> 45:46.250
Enough money and the right connections,

45:46.351 --> 45:48.985
you can do pretty much anything down here.

45:53.758 --> 45:54.925
(glass clatters)

45:55.026 --> 45:56.426
Oh, God.

45:56.527 --> 45:58.361
(chuckles)

46:20.916 --> 46:22.417
What you want, friend?

46:23.453 --> 46:25.087
You want some of this?

46:25.188 --> 46:26.921
- A switchblade.
- I'll use it, too.

46:27.022 --> 46:28.422
Of that I have no doubt.

46:28.523 --> 46:31.492
But what good would another
dead Negro do either of us?

46:31.593 --> 46:33.094
Make me feel a mite better.

46:33.195 --> 46:35.496
We have no quarrel, Mr. Purnsley.

46:35.597 --> 46:37.231
How about you getting
even for Dickie Pastor?

46:37.332 --> 46:39.100
That account has been settled.

46:39.201 --> 46:42.303
And in any event, it was
merely financial in nature.

46:51.845 --> 46:54.046
I'm here on new business.

47:00.286 --> 47:02.521
- Mr. White...
- He ain't here right now.

47:02.622 --> 47:04.156
Why should he be

47:04.257 --> 47:06.425
when he has you to do the slave labor?

47:07.994 --> 47:10.962
He offered to give you up

47:11.063 --> 47:13.499
in exchange for Dickie Pastor.

47:13.600 --> 47:16.867
His Libyan brother for a Nordic devil.

47:16.968 --> 47:19.470
Chalky White ain't never been my friend.

47:19.661 --> 47:22.062
Well, that much is obvious.

47:49.489 --> 47:51.123
(unzips)

47:51.224 --> 47:55.193
Do you know what this is?

48:00.634 --> 48:02.534
Heroin.

48:04.570 --> 48:07.104
It is freedom.

48:07.205 --> 48:09.073
Power.

48:09.174 --> 48:12.209
Control over men who are lesser than you.

48:12.311 --> 48:15.680
Chalky White is one of those men.

48:15.781 --> 48:17.582
Where you going, friend?

48:18.717 --> 48:21.050
As far as you'd like me to take you.

48:21.152 --> 48:24.120
But we shall go there together.

48:26.123 --> 48:28.392
- (music playing)
- (Thunder crashing)

48:34.799 --> 48:37.700
(sighs)

48:45.741 --> 48:47.442
(pounding at door)

48:47.543 --> 48:50.012
August: McCoy, you in there?

48:52.081 --> 48:53.982
(pounding)

48:54.083 --> 48:55.583
McCoy!

48:55.685 --> 48:57.752
Let's settle this!

49:05.027 --> 49:07.962
(pounding)

49:12.667 --> 49:15.368
Augie. I didn't hear you.

49:15.469 --> 49:18.004
(sniffs) The hell you chopping coconuts

49:18.105 --> 49:20.373
at 3:00 in the morning for?

49:20.474 --> 49:22.075
Doc says drink a quart a day.

49:22.176 --> 49:23.877
You know, good for the ticker.

49:23.978 --> 49:26.679
Augie, okay.

49:26.780 --> 49:29.349
That business this evening,
I know what you're thinking.

49:29.450 --> 49:31.583
I'll bet you don't.

49:31.684 --> 49:34.954
- (choking)
- But you're gonna know about it now.

49:39.625 --> 49:41.861
Hubert: How'd it happen, Rick?

49:43.496 --> 49:45.697
Clearing out the barn.

49:45.798 --> 49:48.233
There's a lot of junk in there.

49:48.334 --> 49:51.903
That pile's practically
coming down on its own.

49:52.004 --> 49:55.773
I keep telling her, but, you know.

49:59.278 --> 50:01.246
Tell her what?

50:02.748 --> 50:04.348
You're her brother.

50:04.448 --> 50:06.683
I don't...

50:11.222 --> 50:13.490
It's like she's under ice.

50:13.591 --> 50:15.725
She can't move.

50:17.061 --> 50:19.528
Gerry's gone.

50:19.629 --> 50:22.031
She's gonna have a child to raise.

50:23.433 --> 50:26.102
This isn't any kind of place to live alone.

50:26.203 --> 50:30.806
I mean, she thinks the world of you,

50:30.908 --> 50:33.276
but you're only visiting.

50:33.377 --> 50:36.544
- All squared away.
- Wish you'd let me help, Emmy.

50:36.645 --> 50:38.746
You wouldn't know where to put things.

50:40.416 --> 50:42.117
When's the train?

50:42.218 --> 50:44.286
2:27.

50:44.387 --> 50:46.421
We'll get him there in plenty of time.

50:53.028 --> 50:55.062
Don't be a loon, Rick.

50:55.163 --> 50:57.864
I'll carry it.

50:57.966 --> 50:59.934
You Harrows.

51:00.035 --> 51:02.736
You act like there's no one else on Earth.

51:18.185 --> 51:21.620
In France when I couldn't sleep...

51:22.722 --> 51:25.690
when I was full of fear,

51:25.791 --> 51:28.260
I'd think about the day I'd come home.

51:30.729 --> 51:33.531
I'd be in my dress uniform.

51:33.632 --> 51:35.700
I'd have medals.

51:35.801 --> 51:38.136
I wouldn't wear them, but I'd have them.

51:39.804 --> 51:42.539
I'd see the yard,

51:42.640 --> 51:45.542
the cornflowers along the fence.

51:47.479 --> 51:50.747
The porch, the old flag.

51:52.884 --> 51:56.019
Mother, Father, Sampson,

51:56.153 --> 51:58.654
you.

52:10.034 --> 52:12.734
Send me an address,

52:12.835 --> 52:15.471
if you want me to know where you are.

52:20.510 --> 52:22.511
Come here.

52:35.790 --> 52:37.425
Richard.

52:39.128 --> 52:41.896
You need to call yourself to account.

53:05.118 --> 53:06.852
(knocking)

53:11.791 --> 53:14.193
Mr. Thompson, we're here for your bags.

53:14.294 --> 53:19.097
And this came for you.

53:19.198 --> 53:20.898
Thank you, sir.

53:43.388 --> 53:45.956
(piano playing)

53:46.057 --> 53:48.524
Man: Best thing since
sliced bread, I think.

53:48.625 --> 53:50.526
- Well, I think we've got a deal.
- Yeah.

53:50.627 --> 53:52.728
Shall we shake on it?

53:52.829 --> 53:55.030
- You bet.
- Put her there.

53:55.132 --> 53:57.800
You're gonna love this. See right here?

54:03.039 --> 54:05.207
Outside line.

54:05.308 --> 54:07.709
Bill McCoy, please.

54:07.810 --> 54:09.377
Thank you.

54:12.148 --> 54:14.282
Paging Mark Frasin.

54:18.721 --> 54:20.154
Bill: Hello?

54:20.288 --> 54:21.888
It's me.

54:21.990 --> 54:23.491
Who?

54:23.592 --> 54:26.627
- Nucky.
- Hey, Nuck.

54:26.728 --> 54:28.229
Jesus.

54:28.330 --> 54:30.464
I'm in.

54:30.565 --> 54:31.965
What?

54:32.066 --> 54:35.135
The deal, I've reconsidered.

54:35.236 --> 54:37.203
Tell your hillbilly friend Tucker I'm in.

54:37.304 --> 54:40.039
But he answers to me, understand?

54:40.141 --> 54:42.041
Sure, Nuck.

54:42.143 --> 54:43.709
Right.

54:43.810 --> 54:45.533
Of course.

54:45.569 --> 54:48.240
I'll be sending someone down
in a few days with the money.

54:49.740 --> 54:52.384
- Hello?
- Yes.

54:52.485 --> 54:54.553
- Thank you.
- All right, then.

54:54.654 --> 54:56.488
(hangs up)

55:26.950 --> 55:29.286
(music playing)

55:32.657 --> 55:35.124
(sobbing)

55:40.497 --> 55:42.998
(wailing)

55:46.002 --> 55:47.469
* Florida *

55:47.571 --> 55:50.038
* I'm on my way, leave today *

55:50.139 --> 55:54.076
* Nevermore to roam *

55:54.177 --> 55:55.943
* Florida *

55:56.044 --> 55:58.613
* Your sheltering palms, native arms *

55:58.714 --> 56:02.283
* Beckon me back home *

56:02.384 --> 56:06.688
* Where the sun shines by daytime *

56:06.788 --> 56:10.825
* My sweetheart shines at nighttime *

56:10.926 --> 56:12.959
* In Florida *

56:13.060 --> 56:15.028
* My Florida *

56:15.129 --> 56:20.300
* I'm coming back to you *

56:20.401 --> 56:22.336
* Where the cold winds never blow *

56:22.437 --> 56:24.137
* Where there's never ice nor snow *

56:24.239 --> 56:25.872
* That's Florida *

56:25.973 --> 56:28.541
* Florida *

56:28.642 --> 56:31.009
* And the tropic skies of blue *

56:31.111 --> 56:32.811
* And the golden sunset's hue *

56:32.912 --> 56:37.149
* It's Florida, Florida *

56:37.251 --> 56:38.851
* Hearts are young *

56:38.952 --> 56:41.487
* For nature is at its best *

56:41.588 --> 56:45.823
* Romance calls when all
of the world's at rest *

56:45.924 --> 56:47.992
* Here's the thing I'd like to know *

56:48.093 --> 56:49.861
* Why the whole world doesn't go *

56:49.962 --> 56:52.664
* To live in Florida *

56:52.765 --> 56:54.699
* My Florida *

56:54.800 --> 56:59.303
* I'm coming back to you. *
