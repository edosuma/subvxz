00:33.833 --> 00:35.266
Hello?

00:35.335 --> 00:37.326
- Sizwe Biko?
- Yes.

00:37.404 --> 00:40.271
You need to come
to Pollsmore Prison... Tonight.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.399
- Who is this?
- That is irrelevant.

00:42.475 --> 00:44.443
Come now.

01:03.830 --> 01:05.923
No exchange of... Fuck off.

01:12.138 --> 01:13.935
You need to get him out.

01:15.508 --> 01:17.533
Find a way.

03:48.528 --> 03:50.758
Wait!

03:55.235 --> 03:56.725
Andre, hold him fast.

03:58.871 --> 04:00.771
It always makes me laugh
to see a kaffir

04:00.840 --> 04:02.831
think he's beaten the odds.

04:05.778 --> 04:07.837
Look what you've
fucking done to him.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.314
I'll fix it.

04:17.390 --> 04:20.223
You think we don't know
what you are up to, huh?

04:20.293 --> 04:23.490
Who's gonna buy
diamonds from you, huh?

04:23.563 --> 04:26.361
They're going to want to know
where they came from.

04:26.432 --> 04:29.230
And you know where
they came from.

04:29.302 --> 04:31.896
They're fucking stolen.

04:33.373 --> 04:37.173
From my people by your people.

04:37.243 --> 04:39.575
We tried to give him
an opportunity,

04:39.646 --> 04:42.012
to give him work.

04:42.081 --> 04:44.743
You know how
he thanked us? Huh?

04:48.488 --> 04:52.083
By stealing diamonds
from their rightful owner.

04:56.996 --> 04:59.487
When I worked security at the mines,

04:59.565 --> 05:04.366
the kaffirs would do anything
to steal stones.

05:05.405 --> 05:08.033
They would stick them
up their ass,

05:08.107 --> 05:10.598
wedge them in their gums.

05:10.677 --> 05:14.306
Heh, one of them even cut
the heel of his foot open

05:14.380 --> 05:16.610
from front to back

05:16.683 --> 05:19.277
and lined it with small stones.

05:19.352 --> 05:22.515
But we always caught them.

05:24.257 --> 05:27.283
You can't sell those stones to anyone.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.090
You can't prove they're yours.

05:30.163 --> 05:33.132
Who do you think
a court would believe, huh?

05:33.199 --> 05:35.759
A decorated cop

05:35.835 --> 05:39.202
or a filthy colored half-caste.

05:39.272 --> 05:42.207
Yeah.

05:47.146 --> 05:49.307
You may have killed apartheid,

05:49.382 --> 05:51.942
but you didn't get it all.

05:52.018 --> 05:54.043
Oh no.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.520
We gave you the vote,

05:56.589 --> 05:59.422
but we kept the money.

06:03.329 --> 06:04.591
Get him.

06:10.236 --> 06:11.498
Get him.

06:17.577 --> 06:19.067
Rudy, get up.

06:28.721 --> 06:30.211
Rudy?

06:32.925 --> 06:35.155
Oh, my boy.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.622
Hey! You've killed
my son, you eggar.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.868
You don't even
fucking understand.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.598
There's nothing you can do
to save your father.

07:19.672 --> 07:22.334
He's not a hero.

07:22.408 --> 07:25.241
He's a fucking criminal.

07:26.312 --> 07:28.610
You know nothing
about my father.

07:28.681 --> 07:31.946
Oh, I know.

07:32.018 --> 07:35.112
He's about to lose his son.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.762
Your father will keep his son.

07:52.238 --> 07:54.263
And he will be buried with his.

07:56.242 --> 07:58.039
Thank you.

07:58.110 --> 08:00.578
You do not have to thank me.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.841
Just go and do what you must.

08:22.068 --> 08:24.127
I will deal with them.

08:24.203 --> 08:25.898
You must go.

08:33.645 --> 08:35.705
- Nicholas?
- Yeah, who's this?

08:35.780 --> 08:38.614
- This is Sizwe.
- Sizwe?

08:38.683 --> 08:41.208
- Wow. Long time no talk.
- I have a problem.

08:41.287 --> 08:43.914
I need to get rid
of several quality diamonds.

08:43.990 --> 08:46.550
Perhaps you have these kind
of contacts in Los Angeles.

08:46.626 --> 08:49.857
Go no further, my friend.
You know what? I got you covered.

08:49.929 --> 08:52.022
I know just the people out here
that can take care of you.

08:52.098 --> 08:54.157
Oh my God, Sizwe Biko.

08:54.233 --> 08:57.396
I'm coming to LA.
Can I stay with you for a few days?

08:57.470 --> 09:00.132
Of course!
I cannot believe this.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.003
I haven't seen you
since San Diego State.

09:02.074 --> 09:04.099
Yes. It has been too long.

09:04.176 --> 09:06.303
So you're telling me
that you're going to Los Angeles,

09:06.379 --> 09:07.505
but you can't tell me what for

09:07.580 --> 09:09.946
and you can't tell me
exactly when you'll be back?

09:10.016 --> 09:12.849
Yes. I will explain
everything when I return.

09:12.919 --> 09:15.649
Well, you might not have me
here to explain it to.

09:15.721 --> 09:19.384
I love you and I will
be back soon. I promise.

09:19.458 --> 09:21.824
Does this have to do
with your father?

12:00.020 --> 12:03.620
A subtitle made possible by R3V0LV3R.

12:27.646 --> 12:29.944
So this nigger's
a martial arts champion?

12:30.015 --> 12:31.949
Don't be using that word
in front of him, man.

12:32.017 --> 12:33.712
Uh, he won't understand, man.

12:33.786 --> 12:36.550
He's not used to people saying,
"Nigger this, nigger that."

12:36.622 --> 12:39.557
Yeah, with your ignorant ass.
He's from South Africa, dude.

12:39.625 --> 12:41.957
They don't get down
with the racial slurs like that.

12:42.027 --> 12:44.188
Man, this ain't no racial slur.

12:44.263 --> 12:47.460
And I hope he ain't all uptight
and shit like you two bitches.

12:47.533 --> 12:50.502
- I ain't no bitch.
- He's not. Just show some respect.

12:52.238 --> 12:54.206
" Get it how you can, son,
be the man, son. "

12:54.273 --> 12:56.571
" Hold that money tight,
like it's ransom. "

12:56.642 --> 12:59.110
" Stacking grands, son,
for the fam, son. "

12:59.178 --> 13:01.442
" Trying to spend on the nieces
and the grandsons. "

13:01.514 --> 13:03.209
" Life's a struggle
so I do it big... "

13:03.282 --> 13:05.250
- There he is.
- All right.

13:05.317 --> 13:07.785
- Yo, Sizwe!
- Hey, Mpho.

13:08.921 --> 13:11.754
Hurry up, man. Get in the car.
There's cops over here.

13:11.824 --> 13:13.553
Okay, he's in the van.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.184
Just let me grab
the plate number.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.099
Mpho, bro.

13:21.167 --> 13:22.566
Hey, man. How's it going?

13:22.635 --> 13:24.034
Good, man. Good.

13:24.103 --> 13:26.196
It's good to be off of that plane,
I'll tell you that.

13:26.272 --> 13:28.365
I bet, man.
I hate them long flights.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.840
Nigger, you ain't never
been on a long flight.

13:30.910 --> 13:32.275
Shut your broke ass up!

13:32.344 --> 13:34.972
Anyway, how's it going?

13:35.047 --> 13:36.571
I'm good. I'm good.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.844
It's been a long time.
What is it, 10 years?

13:38.918 --> 13:40.317
- Yeah.
- Ahem!

13:40.386 --> 13:42.183
- You ain't gonna introduce us or...
- Oh, sorry.

13:42.254 --> 13:44.222
These are my boys.
That's Gerald

13:44.290 --> 13:45.587
and that's, uh, Gilroy.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.684
What's up, man?
How you doing, bro? Okay.

13:48.761 --> 13:51.355
Sizwe Biko.
It is an honor to meet you.

13:51.430 --> 13:54.263
Hey, so, uh, Mpho say
you like Bruce Lee,

13:54.333 --> 13:56.198
Jackie Chan or some shit.

13:56.268 --> 13:57.895
He is exaggerating.

13:57.970 --> 13:59.437
Don't be so humble, man.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.200
I won a couple of titles.

14:01.273 --> 14:03.867
Hey, man, now that's tight.
How you say your name?

14:03.943 --> 14:06.275
- Sizwe.
- Seize-ay?

14:06.345 --> 14:08.438
Sizwe. Gosh.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.312
Now that's a tough one, dog.
You gonna need a nickname.

14:11.383 --> 14:12.873
I've been called the Cobra.

14:12.952 --> 14:15.420
The Cobra?
Oh, that's kinda cool, man,

14:15.487 --> 14:17.352
but ever since Stallone made

14:17.423 --> 14:19.857
that fucked-up-ass movie,
that shit ain't been hip.

14:19.925 --> 14:22.120
Those Cobra Kai queers
didn't help matters either.

14:22.194 --> 14:25.254
"Get him a body bag. Yeah!"

14:27.533 --> 14:30.058
No, that's all right, man.
I'll come up with a nickname for you.

14:30.135 --> 14:31.329
- Okay.
- Let me ask you,

14:31.403 --> 14:34.167
you like ultimate fighting?
Nigga, I love that shit!

14:34.240 --> 14:39.507
I love it! Bam!
Yeah! Take that, bitch.

14:39.578 --> 14:42.342
Don't mind him.
He hasn't taken his medication yet.

14:42.414 --> 14:44.814
- No problem.
- Your friend Nicholas called

14:44.884 --> 14:47.910
this morning. He said to
expect him tomorrow night at 8:00.

14:47.987 --> 14:49.579
It's supposed to be tonight.

14:49.655 --> 14:51.646
Tonight I've got some plans already.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.521
Well, what are we doing tonight?

14:53.592 --> 14:55.423
It's a surprise, fool.
Just keep driving.

14:55.494 --> 14:57.894
" So tall that the clouds might fall "

14:57.963 --> 15:00.022
" 'Cause there's no room in the sky. "

15:00.099 --> 15:01.498
" Now, homie, get it how you can. "

15:01.567 --> 15:03.091
" Get it how you can, homie. "

15:03.168 --> 15:05.193
" Get it how you can,
get it how you can, homie. "

15:05.271 --> 15:08.104
" Get it how you can, get it
how you can, homie. "

15:08.173 --> 15:08.274
So this is it, Sizwe.

15:08.275 --> 15:11.471
So this is it, Sizwe.

15:11.543 --> 15:13.670
Nice... nice place.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.407
Thanks.

15:15.481 --> 15:18.382
- Let me show you your room.
- Um, where is the toilet?

15:18.450 --> 15:21.248
- Around the corner.
- I'll be right back.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.413
- Yeah.
- He all right?

15:23.489 --> 15:25.354
Maybe he got Zulu fever.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.483
Man, you're full of crap,
you know that?

15:27.559 --> 15:30.392
What? I saw it
on Discovery Channel.

15:30.462 --> 15:32.726
I saw it too, man.
He... he telling the truth.

15:32.798 --> 15:36.325
So we've located the subject.
Now we just sit on him.

15:36.402 --> 15:39.371
Okay, cool.

15:43.709 --> 15:45.734
Can we listen to the radio?

16:14.106 --> 16:16.506
How long you've
been engaged, man?

16:16.575 --> 16:17.735
Three months.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.040
Three months?
You must be excited?

16:20.112 --> 16:22.444
Yes, I suppose.

16:22.514 --> 16:24.175
What do you mean?

16:24.249 --> 16:27.275
I don't know. If women came
with an instruction manual,

16:27.353 --> 16:29.583
life would be such simpler.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.589
Yeah, "Relationship for Dummies."

16:31.657 --> 16:33.124
True that, Suzy Q.

16:33.192 --> 16:35.353
That's why I'm not
with nobody right now, man.

16:35.427 --> 16:37.452
I sh... I just don't know
how to deal with 'em.

16:37.529 --> 16:40.157
You sucka booty-ass nigger.
You ain't with nobody right now

16:40.232 --> 16:41.722
'cause you ain't got no game.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.893
Bitch, I don't see
your country ass with no number.

16:43.969 --> 16:45.800
- Nigger, I already got my stable.
- Yeah,

16:45.871 --> 16:48.567
stable full'a hos
and skanks and skeezers...

16:48.640 --> 16:51.006
Will you two shut up, please?

16:51.076 --> 16:54.477
Hello? Ooh, come on in.

16:55.581 --> 16:57.242
Who was that?

16:57.316 --> 16:59.876
You'll see.
How we doing with the...

16:59.952 --> 17:02.546
- how we doing on the drinks?
- We good. Why?

17:02.621 --> 17:05.317
- What's going on?
- Don't worry.

17:05.391 --> 17:08.053
Hmm, it must be the pizza man.

17:09.694 --> 17:12.528
Pizza man?
We just had In-N-Out.

17:18.569 --> 17:21.300
Gentlemen, allow me
to introduce these fine ladies.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.704
Actually, ladies, why don't you
go ahead and introduce yourselves?

17:23.776 --> 17:25.868
Hi. I'm Sabrina.

17:25.944 --> 17:28.208
- I'm Maggie.
- Crystal.

17:28.280 --> 17:31.010
Rosemary,
but you can call me Rose.

17:31.083 --> 17:33.950
Now, ladies, who...
who of you wants a drink?

17:34.019 --> 17:36.010
- Me, me.
- I do!

17:36.088 --> 17:37.521
Listen to me,
when you walked in that door,

17:37.589 --> 17:39.318
I knew I had to have you in my life.

17:39.391 --> 17:42.622
You know Snoop? That's my boy.

17:42.694 --> 17:44.753
I originated the term "Dogg."

17:44.830 --> 17:46.889
- Really?
- Nicholas is coming tonight?

17:46.965 --> 17:50.128
No. He's meeting
with some big investor about his movie.

17:50.202 --> 17:52.693
But he said he'd see
you tomorrow night.

17:52.771 --> 17:56.104
Um, why don't we get
out of this place?

17:56.175 --> 17:58.234
Go somewhere.

17:58.310 --> 17:59.709
I am engaged.

17:59.778 --> 18:01.769
And?

18:01.847 --> 18:04.407
- Excuse me.
- I've got some blow.

18:06.718 --> 18:08.652
Okay, just one more. Okay.

18:11.156 --> 18:12.987
Could I borrow him
for a moment, please?

18:13.058 --> 18:15.049
Hey, what's up?

18:20.332 --> 18:22.323
Where'd you get these?

18:22.401 --> 18:25.529
They are my family's diamonds.

18:25.604 --> 18:28.869
The truth is I need the money badly.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.602
Why?

18:40.018 --> 18:41.747
" Just let go, lose control. "

18:42.121 --> 18:44.783
" When we rock the party,
make the crowd say, "Oh!". "

18:44.857 --> 18:46.984
" We don't know self-control. "

18:47.059 --> 18:49.619
" Just lean back
and let it go, let it go. "

18:49.695 --> 18:52.163
" Just let go, lose control. "

18:52.231 --> 18:53.789
" When we rock the party,
make the crowd say, "Oh!." "

18:53.866 --> 18:54.992
Hi.

18:55.067 --> 18:57.297
- Hey, cutie.
- " We don't know self-control. "

18:57.369 --> 18:59.599
" Just lean back
and let it go, let it go. "

18:59.671 --> 19:02.640
" Aw yeah, come on. "

19:02.708 --> 19:05.040
" Aw yeah, come on. "

19:05.110 --> 19:06.941
" Uh-oh, time to let it go. "

19:07.012 --> 19:08.877
" Let loose and get
the juices flowing, y'all. "

19:08.947 --> 19:11.415
" Rock the beat, okay,
hands up up. "

19:11.483 --> 19:13.678
" Stick 'em sky high,
40 Watts is in the house. "

19:13.752 --> 19:15.583
" And we want
to see you bounce. "

19:15.654 --> 19:17.588
" Pump the bass
and let the highs rock "

19:17.656 --> 19:19.851
" 'Cause we gonna let it ride
like it's a blast... "

19:19.925 --> 19:22.257
Hey, Sizwe. What up, baby?

19:22.327 --> 19:24.591
How you doing,
my African head thumper?

19:24.663 --> 19:26.187
Come here,
I need to talk to you real quick.

19:26.265 --> 19:28.699
I'll be right back, baby, okay?
Everything cool?

19:28.767 --> 19:30.860
- How the party treating you?
- Very good, bro.

19:30.936 --> 19:32.995
Good? That's cool, that's cool.
That's what's up.

19:33.071 --> 19:34.971
- Carter, what up with it, baby?
- What up with it?

19:35.040 --> 19:36.530
- How you doing, man?
- I'm good.

19:36.608 --> 19:38.235
This Sizwe. Sizwe, Carter.

19:38.310 --> 19:41.108
What's up, man? Hold on.
What's your name?

19:41.180 --> 19:45.082
Sizwe... Like,
he's a martial arts master.

19:45.150 --> 19:48.415
See, my friend here
is a martial arts master too.

19:48.487 --> 19:49.784
He's awesome.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.016
Now what do you study?

19:52.090 --> 19:54.718
I... I study several styles
of martial arts.

19:54.793 --> 19:57.159
Right now it is
cobra-style kung fu.

19:57.229 --> 19:59.527
Cobra-style kung fu?

20:02.301 --> 20:03.928
I'm just playing. I'm playing.

20:04.002 --> 20:05.731
It's all good, man.
Hold on... Back up.

20:05.804 --> 20:07.635
- All right, all right.
- Let me show what I do.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.640
Let me show you
my stuff, all right?

20:16.949 --> 20:19.213
- Pull your pants up, man.
- That was totally cool.

20:19.284 --> 20:21.149
One more thing.
Give me that frickin' beer.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.687
- Man!
- Shut up. Give it to me.

20:22.754 --> 20:24.619
He ain't getting my beer.

20:24.690 --> 20:28.057
Now in America, this is what you have
to do to pass your black belt test.

20:28.126 --> 20:29.491
Okay? Trust me.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.552
You're gonna look awesome.

20:32.698 --> 20:34.165
Hey, Sizwe.

20:37.836 --> 20:39.394
- Hey hey.
- Okay okay.

20:39.471 --> 20:41.962
You ready?
You might want to move.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.735
All right.

20:43.809 --> 20:47.245
- Aw, I missed! Again?
- What the hell is wrong with you?

20:47.312 --> 20:49.041
I'm too drunk. Okay.

20:49.114 --> 20:51.912
Sorry about the spillage.
One more question.

20:51.984 --> 20:54.179
In cobra-style kung fu,

20:54.253 --> 20:56.687
what do you when someone comes
at you with one of these?

20:56.755 --> 21:00.247
Holy shit.
Motherfucker's for real.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.923
I would do that.

21:07.065 --> 21:10.159
How that water feel, baby?
You know we friends, right?

21:10.235 --> 21:12.100
We are best of friends.
You know what?

21:12.170 --> 21:14.297
I got a couple people
I need you to take care of.

21:14.373 --> 21:16.671
I got smacked in my face
the other day by this bitch...

21:33.525 --> 21:36.221
Hey, Sizwe? Sizwe?

21:36.295 --> 21:38.286
Have something to eat, man.

21:38.363 --> 21:41.298
Oh, thanks, Mpho.

21:44.202 --> 21:47.228
I didn't sleep so well last night.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.740
My body is still on
Johannesburg time, you know?

21:49.808 --> 21:52.299
Mmm. Try and get
some more rest, okay?

21:52.377 --> 21:54.072
Yeah. Thanks, man.

22:54.506 --> 22:56.167
Very good, son. Again.

22:56.241 --> 22:59.108
Always do everything with intention.
If you throw a strike,

22:59.177 --> 23:01.270
throw it with intention.
Like this. Hah!

23:02.714 --> 23:04.306
Very good, son.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.112
Ooh!

23:06.184 --> 23:08.880
Always do what you need to do
to achieve your goal.

23:08.954 --> 23:11.149
But remember,
always be good to your parents.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.157
- Hmm?
- Yes, Father.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.559
Good boy.

23:18.597 --> 23:19.962
What has happened?

23:20.031 --> 23:21.726
They're trying to kill me.

23:23.435 --> 23:24.902
Sizwe.

23:24.970 --> 23:27.234
Whoa. Easy, man.

23:29.107 --> 23:31.473
What?

23:31.543 --> 23:33.807
Nicholas is at the door.

23:33.879 --> 23:36.473
What?

23:36.548 --> 23:38.948
- You okay, man?
- Yeah.

23:39.017 --> 23:42.544
- What time is it?
- 8:00 p.m.

23:42.621 --> 23:45.385
- What?
- You've been sleeping all day.

23:45.457 --> 23:46.890
Oh, jeez.

23:46.958 --> 23:49.324
Nicholas. Oh,

23:49.394 --> 23:51.487
so good to see you, man.

23:51.563 --> 23:53.656
You too, man. You too.

23:53.732 --> 23:56.292
- It's been too long.
- It has been too long.

23:56.368 --> 23:58.859
- How is your life?
- Never better, never better.

23:58.937 --> 24:01.201
I got a movie going on,
a lot of stuff.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.468
Let me introduce you
to my friends. This is Mpho.

24:03.542 --> 24:05.908
Yeah yeah, we met. Mpho, cool.

24:05.977 --> 24:08.377
- And this is Gilroy and Gerald.
- Gerald, nice.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.381
I like that 'fro.
That's a... it's a good look.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.212
Thanks, baby. I appreciate it.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.252
- We should get going.
- Yeah, cool.

24:14.319 --> 24:17.584
- I shall see you in a bit.
- When are you gonna be back, man?

24:17.656 --> 24:20.284
Oh, don't worry. I got him covered.
Take care of him. Let's go.

24:20.358 --> 24:22.189
Okay.

24:23.662 --> 24:26.722
Man, that dude was higher
than a motherfucker.

24:26.798 --> 24:28.493
Yeah, I caught that.

24:29.634 --> 24:31.329
What do you know
about this buyer?

24:31.403 --> 24:33.735
His name is Goro Tanaka.

24:33.805 --> 24:35.602
- Goro?
- Yeah.

24:35.674 --> 24:37.642
How do you know him?

24:37.709 --> 24:39.574
I'm friends with his son Satoshi.

24:39.644 --> 24:41.475
The guy is loaded. All right?

24:41.546 --> 24:44.310
He's got his hands in everything
from imports to nightclubs.

24:44.382 --> 24:47.078
He's gonna help me
with the financing for the movie too.

24:47.152 --> 24:50.417
I told him what you were
looking to do and he jumped.

24:50.489 --> 24:54.255
I guess Mr. Tanaka is looking
to get into the jewelry business.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.884
And just so you know,

24:55.961 --> 24:58.020
the guy's got a few bodyguards

24:58.096 --> 25:00.530
and a really hot ninja chick.

25:00.599 --> 25:03.261
- You trust him?
- Yeah.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.530
Yeah, I trust him.

25:05.604 --> 25:08.698
All right, if you think
he is the right buyer.

25:08.773 --> 25:12.265
Just know that I will not sell them
unless I feel good about the deal.

25:12.344 --> 25:15.802
I understand.
They're your family diamonds.

25:15.881 --> 25:19.180
I mean, nobody messes
with the family jewels, right?

25:24.122 --> 25:26.352
" Can I get a "hell yes"?
Hell yes. "

25:26.424 --> 25:29.291
" Up in this dance hall 'cause
it's more than a distress call. "

25:29.361 --> 25:31.625
" Can I get an SOS
'cause I'm SOL? "

25:31.696 --> 25:33.994
" Don't think, don't blink,
just follow the spell. "

25:42.073 --> 25:44.007
Gentlemen, come in.

25:57.389 --> 25:58.822
What's up, Satoshi?

25:58.890 --> 26:00.790
Hey, Nick.

26:05.196 --> 26:08.029
- What's this?
- Excuse the formalities.

26:08.099 --> 26:10.932
This must be Mr. Sizwe Biko.

26:12.003 --> 26:14.699
Hello.

26:14.773 --> 26:16.764
Goro Tanaka.

26:18.543 --> 26:21.068
The diamonds, please.

26:36.061 --> 26:38.325
What is that?

26:38.396 --> 26:40.057
What is that, dough?

26:40.131 --> 26:42.861
I thought it best not
to go through customs,

26:42.934 --> 26:44.925
so I used dough
as a packing material.

26:50.575 --> 26:52.509
300,000.

26:52.577 --> 26:55.910
You gotta be kidding. No way.

26:55.981 --> 26:58.950
That's a fair price for black market.

26:59.017 --> 27:02.111
These diamonds have been
in my family for over 100 years.

27:03.922 --> 27:07.551
The offer is still 300,000.

27:08.760 --> 27:11.354
Thank you for your time, gentlemen.

27:15.166 --> 27:16.360
This is total bullshit.

27:20.005 --> 27:21.302
Hold on.

27:26.011 --> 27:29.447
All right. 400.

27:29.514 --> 27:33.143
With all due respect,
Mr. Tanaka,

27:34.753 --> 27:37.415
we can't possibly let these go
for less than 600,000.

27:37.489 --> 27:41.050
That is right.
I've done the research.

27:41.126 --> 27:43.253
They can easily be sold

27:43.328 --> 27:46.229
for a million and a half.

27:46.297 --> 27:48.857
So stoic.

27:50.635 --> 27:53.627
All right, 550,000.

27:53.705 --> 27:57.038
Consider it a big favor.

27:58.309 --> 28:00.504
Is that fair, Sizwe?

28:34.112 --> 28:37.047
I'm glad that we could
do this, gentlemen.

28:38.583 --> 28:40.244
Me too.

28:40.318 --> 28:42.809
It has been a pleasure, sir...

28:42.887 --> 28:45.014
and lady.

29:01.639 --> 29:04.073
There go the guys.

29:04.142 --> 29:06.406
The transaction's complete.
Get paid tomorrow.

29:06.478 --> 29:08.537
- You ready to go home?
- Hey, who's this guy?

29:10.248 --> 29:12.773
That's Marty, their diamond appraiser.
Kind of a weasel.

29:30.068 --> 29:31.831
Hello, girls.

29:34.906 --> 29:38.273
That's weird.
That was Satoshi's car.

29:54.559 --> 29:57.027
Give me two seconds.
My friend's got a loft here.

29:57.095 --> 29:58.756
I just gotta grab a script.

30:03.668 --> 30:05.863
Hey, wait wait wait.
Where are you going?

30:05.937 --> 30:08.064
I'm getting some air.

30:08.139 --> 30:10.164
What, you don't got enough?

30:10.241 --> 30:12.106
Go get your script.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.668
Hup!

31:32.657 --> 31:34.557
Oh my God.

31:37.328 --> 31:40.229
- Damn. What should we do?
- I don't know.

31:41.332 --> 31:43.357
- What happened?
- What should we do?

31:43.434 --> 31:45.493
I don't know.
Take him to a hospital?

31:45.570 --> 31:47.470
Which way did those people go?

31:47.538 --> 31:49.438
Th... they drove away.

31:49.507 --> 31:51.236
I've got to get my money back.

31:51.309 --> 31:54.369
- Money?
- Can you take me to my friend's house?

31:54.445 --> 31:56.640
420 Walton Street.

31:56.714 --> 31:58.238
We should call the police.

31:58.316 --> 32:00.375
No! Please, no.

32:00.451 --> 32:03.648
- Maybe we should take him.
- What? Are you crazy?

32:03.721 --> 32:06.315
This guy could be
a serial rapist for all we know.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.224
- Just help me, okay?
- God, you need to get laid.

32:10.295 --> 32:12.024
Come on.

32:12.096 --> 32:14.894
You take him in your car.
He's not bleeding in my Buick.

32:14.966 --> 32:16.831
So he smacked me
in front of my chick,

32:16.901 --> 32:18.732
so I thought my chick
had my back, right?

32:18.803 --> 32:21.397
Man, you crack baby. I'm tired
of hearing your damn war stories.

32:21.472 --> 32:23.030
- You know what, man? I'm...
- There he is.

32:23.107 --> 32:25.632
- Oh, shit.
- Man, you all right?

32:25.710 --> 32:27.610
- He's far from all right.
- Who are you?

32:27.679 --> 32:29.010
I'm Vicky. I found him.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.877
Sizwe, what the hell happened, man?

32:30.949 --> 32:33.383
It's bad, man. It's bad.

32:33.451 --> 32:35.316
We should have gone with you, man.

32:35.386 --> 32:39.379
So Nicholas set you up.
I knew that bitch was no good.

32:39.457 --> 32:41.755
I don't understand.

32:45.496 --> 32:47.327
This is not like Nicholas.

32:47.398 --> 32:49.298
Man, you want me
to take that bitch out?

32:49.367 --> 32:51.198
No.

32:51.269 --> 32:53.931
We must find another way.

33:12.390 --> 33:14.620
You ready to learn something,
little brother?

33:14.692 --> 33:15.784
Frick yeah.

33:17.195 --> 33:19.288
Wait wait wait.

33:19.364 --> 33:21.332
Uh, so, tell me about the client.

33:21.399 --> 33:24.527
Uh, I just gather
whatever information he needs,

33:24.602 --> 33:25.626
he pays me well.

33:25.703 --> 33:27.637
Okay, so what does he do?

33:27.705 --> 33:29.832
I think he made most
of his money in imports.

33:30.908 --> 33:32.136
You think?

33:32.210 --> 33:34.235
Yes. That's what
he made his money in.

33:34.312 --> 33:36.974
Importing little fucking
trinkets and shit.

33:37.048 --> 33:40.814
Okay. So he sold
a lot of trinkets.

33:40.885 --> 33:43.820
Yes. I mean, he's got
other businesses too,

33:43.888 --> 33:46.379
but, you know, things have gotten
a little weird with them.

33:46.457 --> 33:47.981
You know,
it's a family business.

33:48.059 --> 33:49.924
I'm sensing there's
some internal struggle.

33:49.994 --> 33:53.293
- Oh yeah? Like what?
- His son Satoshi wants to take over,

33:53.364 --> 33:56.128
but Tanaka won't have it.

33:56.200 --> 33:59.192
He loves his protégé Koji though.

33:59.270 --> 34:02.569
He just couldn't give a shit
about his own son.

34:04.108 --> 34:06.235
Tanaka is a very honorable guy.

34:06.310 --> 34:09.507
But his son Satoshi
is a dipshit.

34:11.681 --> 34:14.549
So that's the story.
We gotta get downtown.

34:19.424 --> 34:21.483
What are you doing, man?

34:23.761 --> 34:24.853
Callusing them.

34:24.929 --> 34:27.659
Cobra style has
a lot of finger strikes.

34:27.732 --> 34:29.324
Well, it looked like it hurt.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.300
It is just something
I do while I'm thinking.

34:31.369 --> 34:33.166
Yeah well,
think about this, swizzle stick.

34:33.237 --> 34:36.364
We need to find Nick the dick
before his monkey ass skip town.

34:36.440 --> 34:38.466
We could take him back
to my cousin's house.

34:38.543 --> 34:40.875
There we damn sure
can make him talk.

34:40.945 --> 34:44.745
- Okay, but where do we start looking?
- I do not know.

34:44.815 --> 34:46.340
I only have his cellphone number.

34:46.417 --> 34:48.179
He is not listed anywhere.

34:48.252 --> 34:50.344
Still he does not answer the phone.

34:50.420 --> 34:52.514
Oh, put that shit on speaker, man.

34:55.126 --> 34:57.686
Hey, ho-cake, when we find you,

34:57.762 --> 34:59.593
you's a dead motherfucker now.

34:59.664 --> 35:01.097
Yeah, you punk bitch!

35:01.165 --> 35:03.360
I'm a thug.
I got house shoes on, nigger!

35:09.841 --> 35:12.571
What was the name on that card?

35:12.643 --> 35:14.668
I saw the name on Tanaka's card,

35:14.745 --> 35:17.213
but I cannot remember
the name of the company.

35:17.281 --> 35:20.478
Damn. How bad you hurt, man?

35:22.286 --> 35:23.617
I'm fine.

35:23.688 --> 35:25.918
We need to get you
to a doctor, man.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.389
- I know someone who can help us.
- Who?

35:29.460 --> 35:30.722
My old shihan.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.956
- Yoshi who?
- Shihan.

35:33.030 --> 35:34.861
Like a sensei, only better.

35:34.932 --> 35:38.368
Sizwe traveled here for some special
boot camp about five years ago.

35:38.436 --> 35:40.563
Man, they did crazy stuff, like

35:40.638 --> 35:43.163
attack in the middle
of the night while he was sleeping.

35:43.241 --> 35:45.004
Stuff like that. Right?

35:45.076 --> 35:47.874
- Yes.
- Sound like some ninja shit to me.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.683
I think this is it.

36:02.693 --> 36:04.661
Hey.

36:16.073 --> 36:17.267
I got shotgun now.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.937
Hello?

36:22.013 --> 36:24.140
Yeah, this what I'm talking about.

37:07.592 --> 37:09.321
Shihan?

37:45.329 --> 37:47.889
You have not changed a bit.

37:47.965 --> 37:50.126
A simple "hello"
would have sufficed.

37:50.201 --> 37:53.432
Anyone can do that.
What are you doing here?

37:53.504 --> 37:56.029
Huh.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.268
There is much to tell.

38:02.747 --> 38:05.739
I am hoping you can
help me find him.

38:05.816 --> 38:08.250
Sizwe,

38:08.319 --> 38:12.312
revenge is so unnecessary.

38:12.390 --> 38:14.517
I know.

38:16.227 --> 38:18.491
But I need my diamonds back.

38:28.406 --> 38:30.636
Drink this.

38:35.246 --> 38:38.613
I know, but it will
help you heal quicker.

38:41.419 --> 38:44.718
After this,
we have someplace to visit.

38:44.789 --> 38:47.155
We're going to see
Nicholas's father.

39:11.282 --> 39:14.080
- Hello, Frank.
- Satoshi.

39:14.151 --> 39:17.450
It's Mr. Tanaka.

39:17.521 --> 39:20.046
Okay. I thought
I was meeting with your father.

39:20.124 --> 39:22.718
He asked me to handle this.

39:22.793 --> 39:25.853
- That's never happened before.
- Well, it's happening now.

39:25.930 --> 39:29.229
All right.
Well, my invoices haven't been paid.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.268
I'm wondering when
I can expect payment.

39:31.335 --> 39:34.133
You got balls, Frank,
I'll give you that.

39:34.205 --> 39:36.867
You'll get paid when
the transaction's been finalized.

39:36.941 --> 39:38.932
Yeah well, I thought
it was last night.

39:39.009 --> 39:40.772
Are you calling me a liar?

39:40.845 --> 39:43.405
No. It's just I'm running a business.
I have overhead.

39:43.481 --> 39:45.506
You have overhead?
What do you think we have?

39:45.583 --> 39:48.313
Yeah, no offense, Satoshi,
but that's not my problem. All right?

39:48.386 --> 39:50.479
Per your father's request,
he's my sole client.

39:50.554 --> 39:52.419
That means he's my sole
source of income.

39:52.490 --> 39:55.288
- Then you should have more in savings.
- This is bullshit, all right?

39:55.359 --> 39:57.350
- Where's your father?
- Kazu, help.

39:57.428 --> 40:00.556
- Get your fucking hands off me.
- Get your fucking hands off me.

40:00.631 --> 40:03.691
You know what, Frank? You've been
doing a lot of finger pointing lately.

40:03.768 --> 40:05.736
- Don't do it.
- Maybe I should end that right now.

40:05.803 --> 40:07.361
No! No!

40:07.438 --> 40:10.134
All right. For... forget it.

40:10.207 --> 40:13.643
We will pay you when
and if we're ready. Understand?

40:13.711 --> 40:15.838
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

40:15.913 --> 40:18.746
Yes sir.

40:23.521 --> 40:25.546
Thanks for stopping by, Frank.

40:32.963 --> 40:34.988
They said it would take
a little longer.

40:36.534 --> 40:38.968
Well, did you speak
to accounts payable?

40:39.036 --> 40:41.300
Yeah, I spoke to accounts payable.

40:49.814 --> 40:51.873
- Good morning, Father.
- Morning.

40:53.584 --> 40:55.074
I have a gift for you.

40:55.152 --> 40:56.744
What is it?

41:01.859 --> 41:03.451
I got your money back.

41:05.996 --> 41:07.122
Ahhh!

41:09.867 --> 41:12.893
It was not your place.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.933
You are security,

41:18.008 --> 41:19.999
nothing more.

41:21.078 --> 41:22.909
Now get out!

41:39.463 --> 41:41.761
Man, these guys are
fucked up, you know?

41:41.832 --> 41:43.424
So we're not getting paid?

41:43.501 --> 41:45.469
Not unless we figure
something out.

41:45.536 --> 41:48.130
You provided the requested information.
You should be compensated.

41:48.205 --> 41:50.298
Yeah well,
tell that to the lron Chef.

41:52.977 --> 41:54.877
So what do we do?

41:57.214 --> 42:00.377
I think we should do some more
digging on this guy Sizwe.

42:06.624 --> 42:08.990
Hey, Ane. Hit the bag.

42:09.059 --> 42:11.527
Hey.

42:18.736 --> 42:20.636
Some diamonds are missing.

42:23.874 --> 42:25.705
Marty.

42:28.012 --> 42:30.105
I'm a little embarrassed
'cause I don't have much

42:30.180 --> 42:32.341
in the house to offer.
Uh, diet soda?

42:32.416 --> 42:34.281
- We're fine.
- All right.

42:34.351 --> 42:36.683
So, uh, are we taken care of?

42:36.754 --> 42:38.381
Does 400...

42:40.090 --> 42:42.991
Frank, should we really
be taking these guys on?

42:43.060 --> 42:46.120
Probably not.
But let's fuck with them a little bit.

43:03.113 --> 43:05.240
- Oh my God.
- Hey! Hey!

43:05.316 --> 43:08.843
Hey! Hey! Hey, stop!

43:10.854 --> 43:13.015
Shihan,

43:13.090 --> 43:14.853
thank you.

43:16.493 --> 43:19.257
Lives in Johannesburg
with a woman...

43:19.330 --> 43:21.230
Kiki Van Zyl.

43:21.298 --> 43:24.734
Has a steady job...
actually seems pretty normal.

43:24.802 --> 43:27.737
Why would he be mixed up
in this bullshit?

43:27.805 --> 43:30.831
You know, why would a guy
like this be smuggling diamonds?

43:30.908 --> 43:34.002
Oh, there's an interesting thing
about his father.

43:34.078 --> 43:35.443
What's that?

43:35.512 --> 43:37.673
Uh, he's been in jail
for the last 15 years.

43:37.748 --> 43:39.875
He kill somebody?

43:39.950 --> 43:42.714
No. No, he just blew up
an office building.

43:42.786 --> 43:45.880
- Oh, that's it?
- Well, no one was inside.

43:45.956 --> 43:48.356
He was a freedom fighter
with the PAC.

43:48.425 --> 43:50.256
- That's a radical group?
- Yeah.

43:50.327 --> 43:52.295
Pan Africanist Congress.

43:52.363 --> 43:56.163
So what, uh, what's his name again?
Sipho Biko?

43:56.233 --> 43:57.530
Yeah, him and his cronies
used to blow up

43:57.601 --> 44:00.434
government office buildings
in protest against apartheid.

44:00.504 --> 44:02.369
This guy is a real hero.

44:02.439 --> 44:05.306
Then why is he still in jail?
Apartheid's over.

44:05.376 --> 44:07.970
When apartheid ended in '94,
all his father had to do

44:08.045 --> 44:11.446
was confess his crimes,
but he refused.

44:11.515 --> 44:13.949
Here's... here's a quote
from an article I found:

44:14.018 --> 44:18.250
"if I confess in front of the same men
that murdered my father,

44:18.322 --> 44:21.553
I am slitting my own throat
as they did his."

44:21.625 --> 44:24.423
Damn. That's one tough bastard.

44:24.495 --> 44:26.690
I couldn't do that.

44:26.764 --> 44:28.561
He's been in jail since '92 for that?

44:28.632 --> 44:31.567
I don't think he'd be involved in any
of this if it wasn't for his father.

44:31.635 --> 44:34.001
So what do you think?

44:36.974 --> 44:39.636
I think he's trying to save his dad.

44:39.710 --> 44:41.735
I could get behind that.

44:41.812 --> 44:43.939
Well, so what can we do?

44:46.350 --> 44:48.477
I don't know yet.

44:56.927 --> 44:59.157
Kiki, where are you, babe?

44:59.229 --> 45:01.129
I need to talk to you.

45:01.198 --> 45:03.098
Things have gotten crazy here.

45:03.167 --> 45:05.829
I need you to pick up the phone.

45:23.921 --> 45:27.015
Yo, sizzlin' bacon.
We need you, man.

45:27.091 --> 45:30.151
- Are you calling me swine?
- Come on, man.

45:30.227 --> 45:32.286
You know me better than that.
I ain't gonna

45:32.362 --> 45:34.387
disrespect you, my brethren.

45:36.900 --> 45:38.868
Man, you all right?

45:38.936 --> 45:41.928
I cannot get ahold of my fiancé.

45:42.005 --> 45:44.235
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about that, man. You will.

46:32.156 --> 46:35.216
Nicholas. How are you?

46:35.292 --> 46:37.283
I'm fine. How are you?

46:40.297 --> 46:42.765
What can I do
for you, Nicholas?

46:42.833 --> 46:44.425
I came to get the money.

46:48.806 --> 46:51.741
I thought that you and Satoshi
had your own deal.

46:53.110 --> 46:55.874
Yeah, that was just
a little side, you know.

46:59.183 --> 47:02.084
I'm gonna let this go
because I am a man of my word.

47:02.152 --> 47:04.177
But if there is a problem...

47:05.556 --> 47:06.921
I understand.

47:06.990 --> 47:09.390
There's not gonna be a problem.

47:09.459 --> 47:11.484
I have your word?

47:11.562 --> 47:13.553
Yes sir.

47:15.199 --> 47:17.497
Guess your friend
had your word too.

47:20.070 --> 47:21.833
That was a long story
behind that. That's...

47:21.905 --> 47:23.463
Okay.

47:25.042 --> 47:27.670
All right.

47:34.384 --> 47:36.284
Thank you.

47:36.353 --> 47:38.480
This includes the financing
for my movie too?

47:38.555 --> 47:40.455
Yes.

47:42.192 --> 47:44.092
That's great.

47:47.331 --> 47:49.196
Nicholas?

48:07.885 --> 48:10.046
He got a little greedy.

48:21.832 --> 48:24.130
I don't know, guys.

48:24.201 --> 48:26.465
This sounds very dangerous.

48:26.536 --> 48:28.970
I understand.

48:29.039 --> 48:31.906
I don't want you to do anything
that you do not want to do.

48:31.975 --> 48:33.943
But... it's just it's illegal.

48:34.011 --> 48:35.979
Illegal doesn't mean it's wrong.

48:36.046 --> 48:37.911
That's true.

48:37.981 --> 48:39.915
Sizwe, I haven't said anything,

48:39.983 --> 48:42.474
but I'm a little concerned
about this myself.

48:42.552 --> 48:44.918
These people are dangerous, man.

48:48.091 --> 48:49.649
I don't have a choice.

48:49.726 --> 48:51.853
This is a matter of life and death.

49:11.315 --> 49:13.715
Hello, son.

49:13.784 --> 49:16.048
Hello, Father.

49:16.119 --> 49:18.246
How are things?

49:18.322 --> 49:21.689
Very good. I am engaged.

49:21.758 --> 49:24.192
I will be married in three months.

49:24.261 --> 49:25.956
Mmm.

49:26.029 --> 49:28.395
Congratulations, my son.

49:28.465 --> 49:30.524
I like Kiki.

49:32.536 --> 49:34.800
Father,

49:34.871 --> 49:36.634
what has happened?

49:38.241 --> 49:40.539
They're trying to kill me.

49:42.212 --> 49:44.237
Apartheid may have crumbled,

49:44.314 --> 49:46.578
but its relics still remain, my son.

49:48.819 --> 49:51.549
What can be done?

49:51.621 --> 49:53.987
Oh, nothing, my son.

49:54.057 --> 49:55.684
It is my time.

49:55.759 --> 49:57.556
Don't talk like that.

49:57.627 --> 50:00.095
Father, I've been
without you for 15 years.

50:00.163 --> 50:02.290
- I will not lose you now.
- Shh shh shh.

50:03.533 --> 50:05.626
Come... come close.

50:07.604 --> 50:10.732
I want you to go to
your grandmother's home.

50:10.807 --> 50:13.037
In the backyard,

50:13.110 --> 50:15.738
at the base
of the marula tree...

50:18.448 --> 50:21.508
I want you to start digging
about two feet down.

50:21.585 --> 50:24.213
You'll find a pouch.

50:24.287 --> 50:26.949
A pouch?
What are you talking about?

50:27.024 --> 50:29.015
Diamonds.

50:29.092 --> 50:31.788
There are diamonds
in that pouch.

50:31.862 --> 50:34.558
They belong to us.

50:36.233 --> 50:39.430
They've been in my family
for over 100 years.

50:40.737 --> 50:43.069
Why are you
telling me this now?

50:45.008 --> 50:47.442
In the past the boss
would have killed us

50:47.511 --> 50:49.979
and taken those diamonds.

50:51.248 --> 50:52.909
You... you're the first generation

50:52.983 --> 50:55.383
that can put them to use.
They're your inheritance.

50:58.255 --> 50:59.517
Father.

51:03.360 --> 51:05.351
We have many children.

51:08.031 --> 51:09.726
It's time, Sipho.

51:09.800 --> 51:11.700
What? I just got here.

51:11.768 --> 51:15.135
That siren means there's an emergency.
You've got to get out of here.

51:15.205 --> 51:17.901
You make sure they take care of you.
I will get you help.

51:17.974 --> 51:19.874
Goodbye, my son.

51:19.943 --> 51:21.934
- It's only goodbye for now.
- Come come come.

51:22.012 --> 51:23.570
Let's go. Let's go.

51:23.647 --> 51:26.741
- Come on.
- Father, I will be back for you.

51:26.817 --> 51:28.944
I love you, my son.

51:32.456 --> 51:34.014
They need you in "D" block.

51:34.091 --> 51:36.082
I'll take care of him!

51:38.962 --> 51:40.725
Listen to me.

51:40.797 --> 51:43.095
My name is Zweli Kamalo.

51:43.166 --> 51:45.464
I am a supporter of your father.

51:45.535 --> 51:48.095
I don't want to see him die this way.

51:48.171 --> 51:52.107
Your father refused to stand in front of
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

51:52.175 --> 51:55.440
He is a hero to the millions
of voices that cry for justice.

51:55.512 --> 51:58.606
- You need to get him out.
- How?

51:58.682 --> 52:01.776
Find Judge Pritchard.
He lives in Sandton.

52:01.852 --> 52:03.911
You will have to pay him.

52:03.987 --> 52:06.649
I don't know how much,
but I am sure it won't be cheap.

52:06.723 --> 52:09.817
Find the money
and he will pardon your father.

52:09.893 --> 52:12.521
You must do this immediately.

52:12.596 --> 52:14.655
I will protect him
for as long as I can,

52:14.731 --> 52:17.256
but there is only
so much I can do.

52:17.334 --> 52:20.030
You must go now.

52:20.103 --> 52:22.435
Find a way.

52:22.506 --> 52:24.736
I will. Thank you.

52:28.011 --> 52:29.842
I'm sorry I said what I said.

52:29.913 --> 52:32.438
Of course I'll help.
You know that.

52:36.052 --> 52:38.247
Hey, bro, count me in.

52:39.289 --> 52:41.257
I got you, bro.

52:43.793 --> 52:47.251
Vicky, please know
that whatever you choose,

52:47.330 --> 52:49.355
I understand.

52:50.400 --> 52:52.265
I'll do it.

52:52.335 --> 52:55.702
- Are you gonna take a swim?
- In a bit.

52:59.142 --> 53:01.167
- Hi, can I help you?
- Delivery.

53:03.647 --> 53:04.705
Shhh.

53:04.781 --> 53:07.306
Ooh la la.

53:07.384 --> 53:08.874
Tell me where your boss is now.

53:08.952 --> 53:11.079
Sir, please.
This isn't necessary.

53:11.154 --> 53:14.453
I'll cooperate.
He's in the backyard.

53:14.524 --> 53:17.459
Guys, go inside quickly and quietly.
Have a look around.

53:17.527 --> 53:20.223
See if there's anyone left.
Meet me in the back.

53:20.297 --> 53:22.857
- Stay with him.
- Okay.

53:22.933 --> 53:25.902
Ahhh.

53:25.969 --> 53:29.302
If he does anything, just yell.

53:30.340 --> 53:32.570
Shh.

53:32.642 --> 53:35.577
I'm getting tired
of lounging around this place.

53:35.645 --> 53:37.169
This won't take long.

53:39.182 --> 53:41.446
Let's go to Vegas tonight.

53:41.518 --> 53:43.315
- Mmmm.
- As you wish.

53:43.386 --> 53:45.547
Care if I join you?

53:45.622 --> 53:47.852
Sizwe.

53:47.924 --> 53:49.789
Hey, bro.

53:49.859 --> 53:52.327
- It's not what it looks like.
- Don't even try!

53:52.395 --> 53:55.558
Crystal!
You was in on this from the start?

53:55.632 --> 53:57.657
I thought we had something, baby.

53:57.734 --> 54:00.567
- Hey, we don't know what's going on...
- Don't play dumb, Rose, okay?

54:00.637 --> 54:02.730
We said we don't know anything
about this. Come on, girl.

54:02.806 --> 54:04.740
- Let's get out of here.
- Hey, ain't nobody doing...

54:04.808 --> 54:06.901
- Let go of her!
- Shut up, white boy.

54:06.977 --> 54:09.207
Just cooperate
and everything will work out.

54:09.279 --> 54:10.906
Kick him in the mouth, man!

54:13.183 --> 54:15.242
My cousin won't be back
till tomorrow.

54:15.318 --> 54:17.047
We could do whatever
the fuck we want to do.

54:17.120 --> 54:18.849
Man, let me 86 this nigger, cuz.

54:18.922 --> 54:20.856
Fuck you,
you fucking gangbanger fuck!

54:20.924 --> 54:23.085
- What, punk?
- Where is Tanaka?

54:23.159 --> 54:26.219
And where are my diamonds?

54:26.296 --> 54:28.457
It's not that simple, Sizwe.

54:28.531 --> 54:30.499
Truly it is that simple.

54:30.567 --> 54:32.501
You are going to tell me
what I want to know

54:32.569 --> 54:34.366
or I am going to make
you tell me.

54:34.437 --> 54:36.234
That's what the fuck
I'm talking about.

54:36.306 --> 54:38.171
- Don't.
- Hold on.

54:42.846 --> 54:45.007
Would you please
wait outside, Vicky?

54:45.081 --> 54:47.208
Okay. Be careful.

54:53.857 --> 54:56.018
You know if I talk I am a dead man.

54:57.160 --> 54:59.594
I trusted you, man.

55:00.664 --> 55:03.326
Why would you do this?

55:03.400 --> 55:05.265
To make a movie?

55:06.670 --> 55:08.570
To become famous?

55:08.638 --> 55:10.572
Give me a few days, man.

55:10.640 --> 55:12.540
I'll fix everything,
all right? I swear.

55:14.544 --> 55:17.069
Si... Sizwe, we know nothing about this.

55:17.147 --> 55:19.638
Any misunderstanding
is between you guys.

55:21.484 --> 55:25.147
You know, I'm finding it
hard to believe you.

55:27.257 --> 55:31.023
Should I have Gilroy take you
outside and take care of you?

55:31.094 --> 55:32.425
He will, you know.

55:32.495 --> 55:34.429
I say we kill 'em all.

55:34.497 --> 55:35.555
Yeah, I'm with you.

55:35.632 --> 55:38.294
Gilroy, finish them.

55:38.368 --> 55:41.929
- No. Okay, we'll tell you everything.
- Crystal!

55:42.005 --> 55:44.439
- We know where Tanaka lives.
- Shut the fuck up!

55:44.507 --> 55:47.271
- You shut the fuck up, white boy.
- Fuck you, Q-tip!

55:51.514 --> 55:53.778
It's Kiki. I...

55:53.850 --> 55:55.249
I've got to take this.

55:55.318 --> 55:57.309
Don't do anything.

55:57.387 --> 55:58.911
Don't worry. We'll watch them.

55:58.988 --> 56:00.683
Tell her I said hi.

56:00.757 --> 56:02.816
- Hello?
- Hello? Hell...

56:02.892 --> 56:04.587
- Hello?
- Hello?

56:04.661 --> 56:07.630
I'm right in the middle of something.
I cannot talk right now.

56:07.697 --> 56:09.790
What's all that noise?
Is that a girl?

56:09.866 --> 56:11.424
It is just a friend. He's...

56:11.501 --> 56:13.867
Sizwe, I'm coming to L.A.

56:13.937 --> 56:15.768
No no no no no.
It is too dangerous!

56:15.839 --> 56:18.034
You think you a tough
motherfucker, don't you?

56:18.108 --> 56:19.803
That's right.

56:19.876 --> 56:23.334
You think you could just take
our boy's shit and leave him for dead?

56:23.413 --> 56:25.540
You know what?

56:25.615 --> 56:27.549
I think we should play a game.

56:27.617 --> 56:30.552
My boy Gerald here,
he's from the old school.

56:30.620 --> 56:32.850
Hey, homey,
let me have your heat.

56:34.824 --> 56:37.918
- What are you gonna do with that?
- You'll find out.

56:40.263 --> 56:42.731
We're gonna play a game called
"Where are the Diamonds?"

56:42.799 --> 56:44.824
You gonna tell me
what the fuck I want to know

56:44.901 --> 56:47.301
- or I'm gonna air condition your brain.
- Fuck you.

56:47.370 --> 56:49.600
Fuck me? Yeah well,
you got to the count of three.

56:49.672 --> 56:50.866
One,

56:50.940 --> 56:52.532
two, three.

56:54.744 --> 56:56.268
You are a fucking dead man!

56:56.346 --> 56:58.644
I'd be more concerned
about my own mortality.

56:58.715 --> 57:01.013
Got lucky.
Shit don't happen twice.

57:01.084 --> 57:03.279
Fuck these games.
Nigga... one, two...

57:03.353 --> 57:05.287
Okay okay okay.
I'll fucking tell you!

57:07.791 --> 57:10.487
- I'll tell you.
- I'll let Sizwe know.

57:15.064 --> 57:17.862
Man, you don't know how bad
I want to put a bullet in your head.

57:17.934 --> 57:19.731
You lucky my boy
got love for you.

57:19.803 --> 57:23.330
I don't. Oh oh, you got some?
I'll tell... ahh!

57:47.664 --> 57:49.097
All right, fellas...

57:54.838 --> 57:57.238
Look, man, I'm sorry
about the white-boy joke.

57:58.475 --> 58:00.409
What are you? Italian?

58:00.477 --> 58:02.001
Sizwe!

58:02.078 --> 58:04.546
I promise I will explain
everything when...

58:06.883 --> 58:08.407
Sizwe?

58:11.087 --> 58:12.748
Sizwe?

58:25.435 --> 58:27.903
No!

58:45.188 --> 58:46.212
Pathetic!

59:00.803 --> 59:02.395
Gerald.

59:19.989 --> 59:21.820
Come on. Come on!

59:37.273 --> 59:40.333
- No!
- How about this, huh?

59:46.082 --> 59:47.811
- What the...
- Vanilla lce-looking mother...

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:12.097
Oh, you got your ass beat, huh?

01:00:12.175 --> 01:00:14.006
Where you get your black belt from?

01:00:14.077 --> 01:00:16.705
Goodwill? Bitch.

01:00:20.717 --> 01:00:23.515
Leave me the fuck alone, all right?
I told you everything I know.

01:00:23.586 --> 01:00:24.814
Shut the fuck up, man.

01:00:31.027 --> 01:00:33.257
I'm sorry.

01:00:35.898 --> 01:00:37.832
Vicky, thank you.

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:42.905
I did not know
it was going to be so crazy.

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:44.963
It got out of hand today.

01:00:46.042 --> 01:00:48.408
It's okay.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.275
You're worth it.

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:53.748
Thank you.

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:56.148
Vi... Vicky,

01:00:56.219 --> 01:00:58.585
I can't. I... I'm sorry.

01:00:58.655 --> 01:01:00.555
Why?

01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:02.614
Don't you like me?

01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:04.922
No, I do like you.

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:07.224
But?

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:10.997
I am involved with someone.

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:15.695
I see.

01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:20.137
I am sorry, Vicky.

01:01:20.209 --> 01:01:23.337
I haven't had
a chance to tell you

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:26.280
and it's been on my mind.

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:28.909
I did not want to lead you on.

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:37.286
Well, I feel better
for having known you anyway.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.885
We could still
be friends, right?

01:01:39.962 --> 01:01:42.021
Of course.

01:03:03.913 --> 01:03:06.143
May I help you?

01:03:06.215 --> 01:03:10.083
Uh, is this the residence
of Mpho Masilela?

01:03:10.153 --> 01:03:11.916
Who's asking?

01:03:11.988 --> 01:03:15.651
A friend. Is that a problem?

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:17.352
Yeah. A lot's been
going on lately.

01:03:17.426 --> 01:03:19.394
Does Mpho live here or not?

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:21.760
Yeah, he does,
but I think he's still sleeping.

01:03:21.831 --> 01:03:24.391
You can come in and wait
for him if you want.

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:26.560
Thank you.

01:03:33.242 --> 01:03:37.508
Actually, the person I am really
looking for is my fiancé Sizwe Biko.

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.480
Your what?

01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:41.642
My fiancé. Why?

01:03:41.717 --> 01:03:43.582
- Your fiancé?
- What's it to you?

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:45.780
He didn't say he was engaged.

01:03:45.855 --> 01:03:47.652
- And why should he?
- Because we...

01:03:47.723 --> 01:03:49.816
Where is he?
I need to speak to him now.

01:03:49.892 --> 01:03:52.053
He's in the shower.

01:03:53.729 --> 01:03:56.664
Huh. I knew it.

01:03:56.732 --> 01:03:59.394
- What?
- I knew he came here

01:03:59.468 --> 01:04:02.733
to meet up with
a little fucking whore like you!

01:04:02.805 --> 01:04:04.295
You bitch!

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:06.466
God! What the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:04:09.212 --> 01:04:11.339
- You fucking whore.
- Ow!

01:04:11.414 --> 01:04:12.904
God... what's wrong with... ow!

01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:15.075
I'll fucking kill you,
you American bitch!

01:04:15.151 --> 01:04:16.118
Get... ow!

01:04:31.334 --> 01:04:32.858
Get... ow!

01:04:34.303 --> 01:04:36.396
- Hey!
- Listen here!

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:40.509
- Let 'em fight.
- Shut up. Sizwe!

01:04:40.576 --> 01:04:43.272
Let go! Nappy whore!
You're a nappy whore.

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:45.541
Sizwe! Sizwe!

01:04:46.616 --> 01:04:47.844
- What?
- Siz...

01:04:47.917 --> 01:04:49.646
Kiki! What are you doing here?

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:51.380
Apparently catching you
in the act.

01:04:51.454 --> 01:04:54.014
What are you talking about?
Vicky is my friend.

01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:56.388
Oh, your friend?
I've heard that story before.

01:04:56.459 --> 01:04:59.121
- Guys, I need to speak with Kiki.
- Man, put a shirt on.

01:04:59.195 --> 01:05:00.992
You shouldn't be alone
with that psycho bitch.

01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:03.395
You better watch who you're
calling a fucking bitch, bitch!

01:05:03.466 --> 01:05:05.297
- Guys, guys, excuse us.
- Let 'em fight.

01:05:05.368 --> 01:05:06.392
Easy.

01:05:09.305 --> 01:05:11.205
Are you okay?

01:05:11.274 --> 01:05:13.640
How's your face?

01:05:15.344 --> 01:05:17.141
You're tough. I like that.

01:05:18.814 --> 01:05:20.145
You a fool.

01:05:20.216 --> 01:05:21.683
I tried to call you

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:23.844
and you didn't even bother
to pick up the phone.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.979
I thought it was over between us.

01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:30.590
Let's just go back home, babe,

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:33.857
and we'll sort out
whatever problems we have.

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:38.590
We will.
But this is very dangerous.

01:05:38.668 --> 01:05:42.001
I'm sending you back to South Africa
first thing tomorrow morning.

01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:44.869
Sizwe, I just got here.
I can't turn around and go back.

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:47.466
You've got to trust me on this.

01:05:47.543 --> 01:05:49.204
Trust you?

01:05:49.278 --> 01:05:51.178
What about that girl?

01:05:51.247 --> 01:05:53.613
She is just a friend.

01:05:55.718 --> 01:05:58.551
You can ask anyone. I swear.

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:05.720
There was a reason
I didn't want you to go.

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:20.776
Are you happy?

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:23.673
I'm sorry.

01:06:24.747 --> 01:06:26.738
I'm sorry.

01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:30.919
Why... why didn't
you tell me sooner?

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:33.012
Because I was angry

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:35.580
and I didn't want you
to find out that way.

01:06:57.546 --> 01:06:59.639
- Hello?
- Sizwe Biko?

01:06:59.715 --> 01:07:02.479
- Yes?
- Do you want your diamonds back?

01:07:02.551 --> 01:07:05.145
- Who is this?
- They're at the Tokyo Club.

01:07:05.221 --> 01:07:07.746
11245 Lankershim Boulevard.

01:07:07.823 --> 01:07:10.417
If they're not there,
they're at the warehouse next door.

01:07:11.527 --> 01:07:13.620
Wait, who... hello?

01:07:50.099 --> 01:07:51.964
Father, I will ask you one last time:

01:07:52.034 --> 01:07:54.867
Let me handle this deal.

01:07:54.937 --> 01:07:58.031
Make me your partner.
I won't disappoint you.

01:07:58.107 --> 01:08:01.167
Don't you think
it's a little late for that?

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:06.741
Mr. Tanaka.

01:08:06.816 --> 01:08:08.841
How you doin'?

01:08:10.619 --> 01:08:13.019
Nice club. No karaoke?

01:08:16.358 --> 01:08:18.087
Hey!

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:21.620
This is disrespectful.

01:08:21.697 --> 01:08:23.596
Just business.

01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:36.038
You'll get them back
when we're finished.

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:38.511
Or not.

01:08:46.822 --> 01:08:49.381
Where's Sizwe?

01:09:46.282 --> 01:09:47.840
We have a deal.

01:10:02.798 --> 01:10:04.993
What are you doing?

01:10:05.067 --> 01:10:07.331
You should have
believed in me, Father.

01:10:13.275 --> 01:10:15.175
Don't move!

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:24.248
This is how you prove yourself?

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.720
Betray your family?

01:10:31.827 --> 01:10:34.091
You made your choice.

01:11:04.226 --> 01:11:05.784
South African.

01:11:34.923 --> 01:11:36.754
You'd better get going.

01:15:33.161 --> 01:15:34.423
Hmm.

01:17:24.973 --> 01:17:27.498
You know why I am here.

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:14.310
I just want my money.

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:50.741
You see, Father?

01:19:50.819 --> 01:19:52.252
You do need me.

01:20:59.187 --> 01:21:01.951
Go.

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:34.405
" Every time they see me,
they think of you "

01:22:34.482 --> 01:22:37.076
" I'm the one with the heart
just like you "

01:22:37.152 --> 01:22:39.484
" I'm the one with
the fight just like you. "

01:22:39.554 --> 01:22:41.920
" Can't stop, won't stop
just like you. "

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:44.618
" Every time they see me,
they think of you "

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:47.161
" I'm the one with the ears
just like you. "

01:22:47.228 --> 01:22:49.628
" Music pumping through
my veins just like you. "

01:22:49.698 --> 01:22:52.132
" Anytime we hit a track,
man, it's brand new. "

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.725
" Every time they see me,
they think of you "

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:57.169
" I'm the one with the heart
just like you "

01:22:57.238 --> 01:22:59.763
" I'm the one with
the fight just like you. "

01:22:59.841 --> 01:23:02.139
" Can't stop, won't stop
just like you. "

01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:04.804
" Every time they see me,
they think of you. "

01:23:11.186 --> 01:23:13.950
Guys? Guys!

01:23:16.758 --> 01:23:18.157
Why are you yelling?

01:23:18.226 --> 01:23:21.161
Look. Told you.

01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:23.857
- Let me see.
- Yeah!

01:23:23.932 --> 01:23:26.765
Man, this shit bigger
than I don't know what.

01:23:44.652 --> 01:23:47.450
" Get it how you can, son,
be the man, son. "

01:23:47.522 --> 01:23:49.683
" Hold that money tight,
like it's ransom. "

01:23:49.758 --> 01:23:52.158
" Stacking grands, son,
for the fam, son. "

01:23:52.227 --> 01:23:54.559
" Trying to spend on the nieces
and the grandsons. "

01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:56.494
" Life's a struggle
so I do it big. "

01:23:56.564 --> 01:23:58.725
" Since I was a kid,
I knew that twice was double. "

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.859
" So I been seen
in the nicest bubble. "

01:24:00.935 --> 01:24:03.028
" With the chick
with the nicest bubble. "

01:24:03.104 --> 01:24:05.436
" And it's all for the grind,
all for the shine. "

01:24:05.507 --> 01:24:07.702
" But I ball with my mind,
never fall for the shine. "

01:24:07.776 --> 01:24:09.903
" Yeah, I'll crawl
from behind if I have to. "

01:24:09.978 --> 01:24:12.446
" But when you see me,
I can talk but we laugh too "

01:24:12.514 --> 01:24:14.038
" 'Cause I'm-a be gigglin'. "

01:24:14.115 --> 01:24:15.844
" Honey, I know you'll be listening. "

01:24:15.917 --> 01:24:18.283
" And if you haven't yet
you know you should listen in. "

01:24:18.353 --> 01:24:20.412
" Comin' at the plate,
T is still pitching 'em. "

01:24:20.488 --> 01:24:22.752
" We bait crowds
with the tracks like fishermen. "

01:24:22.824 --> 01:24:25.190
" Any time, anyplace,
any day, any night. "

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:27.490
" Keep that money right
till it's way outta sight. "

01:24:27.562 --> 01:24:29.723
" House so tall that
the clouds might fall "

01:24:29.798 --> 01:24:31.663
" 'Cause there's
no room in the sky. "

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:34.827
" And, homie, get it how you can,
get it how you can, homie. "

01:24:34.903 --> 01:24:37.269
" Get it how you can,
get it how you can, homie. "

01:24:37.338 --> 01:24:39.738
" Get it how you can,
get it how you can, homie. "

01:24:39.808 --> 01:24:42.038
" Get it how you can,
get it how you can. "

01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:44.578
" Black rover,
smooth like a black cobra. "

01:24:44.646 --> 01:24:46.614
" Young dude,
but my stack's older. "

01:24:46.681 --> 01:24:49.377
" When I ball, I don't make them
want to catch me on a replay. "

01:24:49.451 --> 01:24:51.612
" They say the swagger
more kick than T.J. "

01:24:51.686 --> 01:24:53.654
" I'm storming out the gate,
if not in LA "

01:24:53.721 --> 01:24:55.985
" I might be on a Florida estate,
man, I'm more than just great. "

01:24:56.057 --> 01:24:57.854
" Wonder if I should put
some more on my plate. "

01:24:57.926 --> 01:25:00.793
" And we can bet that
I'm-a move along, no setback "

01:25:00.862 --> 01:25:02.557
" I don't run this green
like Jet backs. "

01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:04.154
" Fly like I wear a jet pack. "

01:25:04.232 --> 01:25:06.200
" The chick forgot where her nest at. "

01:25:06.267 --> 01:25:09.168
" And now she laying with me,
like a relative, she staying with me. "

01:25:09.237 --> 01:25:10.966
" Honeys being
what they claimin' to be "

01:25:11.039 --> 01:25:12.904
" I wish for two,
I'm aiming for three. "

01:25:12.974 --> 01:25:15.169
" And if they aiming for the top,
then they aiming for me. "

01:25:15.243 --> 01:25:17.711
" And if they claim I'm a flop,
still I land on a hill. "

01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:20.179
" Get it how I live,
yes, I can and I will. "

01:25:20.248 --> 01:25:22.682
" And, homie, get it how you can,
get it how you can, homie... "

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:24.650
And cut!

01:25:26.254 --> 01:25:28.449
" Get it how you can, homie,
get it how you can. "

01:25:28.523 --> 01:25:30.889
" Get it, get it, get it,
get it how you can. "

01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:33.291
" Get it how you can, homie,
get it how you can. "

01:25:33.361 --> 01:25:35.625
" Get it how you can, homie,
get it how you can. "

01:25:35.697 --> 01:25:37.927
" Get it how you can, homie,
get it how you can. "

01:25:37.999 --> 01:25:39.364
" Get it how you can. "

01:25:39.434 --> 01:25:41.402
" Any time, anyplace,
any day, any night. "

01:25:41.469 --> 01:25:43.960
" Keep that money right
till it's way outta sight. "

01:25:44.038 --> 01:25:46.268
" House so tall that
the clouds might fall "

01:25:46.341 --> 01:25:48.366
" 'Cause there's
no room in the sky. "

01:25:48.443 --> 01:25:51.241
" And, homie, get it how you can,
get it how you can, homie. "

01:25:51.312 --> 01:25:53.576
" Get it how you can, get it
how you can, homie. "

01:25:53.648 --> 01:25:56.082
" Get it how you can,
get it how you can, homie. "

01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:58.415
" Get it how you can,
get it how you can. "

01:25:58.486 --> 01:26:00.852
" Get it how you can, homie,
get it how you can. "

01:26:00.922 --> 01:26:03.322
" Get it how you can, homie,
get it how you can. "

01:26:03.391 --> 01:26:05.655
" Get it how you can, homie,
get it how you can. "

01:26:05.727 --> 01:26:08.127
" Get it how you can, get it,
get it, get it, get it. "

01:26:08.196 --> 01:26:10.426
" Get it how you can, homie,
get it how you can. "

01:26:10.498 --> 01:26:12.864
Get it how you can, get it
how you can, homie.

01:26:12.934 --> 01:26:15.232
" Get it how you can,
get it how you can, homie. "

01:26:15.303 --> 01:26:17.703
" Get it how you can, get it,
get it, get it, get it. "

01:26:17.772 --> 01:26:19.967
" Get it how you can,
get it how you can, homie. "

01:26:20.041 --> 01:26:22.407
" Get it how you can, get it
how you can, homie. "

01:26:22.477 --> 01:26:24.775
" Get it how you can,
get it how you can, homie. "

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:26.074
" Get it how you can. "

01:27:06.988 --> 01:27:12.085
" Go down, Moses. "

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:16.790
" Tell ol' pharaoh. "

01:27:16.864 --> 01:27:22.200
" Let my people go. "

01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:26.297
" Go down, Moses. "

01:27:26.374 --> 01:27:31.334
" Tell ol' pharaoh. "

01:27:31.412 --> 01:27:36.782
" Let my people go "
