00:01.479 --> 00:02.306
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Friends, what a journey

00:02.350 --> 00:03.481
our Jane has been on.

00:03.525 --> 00:04.830
See, she and her
baby daddy, Rafael,

00:04.874 --> 00:07.094
were about to be engaged.

00:07.137 --> 00:09.618
But then her husband Michael
came back from the dead.

00:09.661 --> 00:12.403
See, it turns out
he wasn't dead.

00:12.447 --> 00:15.841
He'd been in Montana.
And he had amnesia.

00:15.885 --> 00:18.061
Actually, I go by Jason now.

00:18.105 --> 00:21.717
Ma'am. And then, OMG,
his memories came back.

00:21.760 --> 00:24.241
Come on, I know you, Jane.
You're gonna have to explore it.

00:24.285 --> 00:25.547
That's not true.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.157
But, friends, Rafael was right.

00:27.201 --> 00:30.247
I can't just dismiss
how I feel about Michael.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.249
And then Michael
made a proposal of his own.

00:32.293 --> 00:33.685
We'll never know
what could be

00:33.729 --> 00:34.773
as long as
we're here.

00:34.817 --> 00:36.862
In Miami.
Surrounded by

00:36.906 --> 00:38.081
the ghosts of our past.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.430
Come with me
to Montana.

00:39.474 --> 00:41.084
Let's go.

00:41.128 --> 00:43.956
Which is where we left off.

00:45.784 --> 00:49.223
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva
was 30 years old,

00:49.266 --> 00:51.616
she called an emergency
family meeting...

00:51.660 --> 00:53.662
And the reason for this
emergency family meeting is...

00:55.098 --> 00:58.188
...I'm going to Montana
with Michael tomorrow.

00:58.232 --> 01:00.625
Montana?Tomorrow?

01:00.669 --> 01:03.367
I know. It's crazy.
Totally crazy.

01:03.411 --> 01:04.803
But Rafael has Mateo
for three days,

01:04.847 --> 01:06.414
and we found
cheap flights,

01:06.457 --> 01:08.242
and Michael and I need
to get away from the memories

01:08.285 --> 01:10.244
of our past, just to see
where we are now.

01:14.509 --> 01:16.598
I think it's
a great idea, hon.

01:16.641 --> 01:19.340
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:19.383 --> 01:21.907
Yay! Oh. Okay.

01:21.951 --> 01:24.432
Our flight leaves early,
so, uh, I'd better

01:24.475 --> 01:25.868
start working on
my packing list.

01:25.911 --> 01:27.652
Ooh, I'm excited!

01:29.306 --> 01:31.265
Which brings us here.

01:31.308 --> 01:32.396
Now.

01:32.440 --> 01:33.658
What was I thinking?

01:33.702 --> 01:35.312
I can't go to Montana.

01:36.531 --> 01:38.402
Because it's in Montana.

01:38.446 --> 01:40.056
And what are you doing here
so early, Ma?

01:40.100 --> 01:41.492
I knew you'd
be freaking out.

01:41.536 --> 01:44.147
Don't freak out.
You're going.

01:44.191 --> 01:45.366
But where will it even lead?

01:45.409 --> 01:47.672
And-and where do I
even want it to lead?

01:47.716 --> 01:49.935
You don't know.
That's the point of the trip.

01:49.979 --> 01:52.068
Just go with the flow.
Don't get ahead of yourself.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.287
But...No buts.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.289
It's happening.
End of story.

01:55.332 --> 01:59.031
But...Mateo will be fine.
I'll check in on him.

01:59.075 --> 02:02.209
Will you check in
on, uh, Rafael?

02:02.252 --> 02:03.949
Just to make sure
that he's doing okay?

02:03.993 --> 02:05.255
Yes. Of course.

02:05.299 --> 02:07.866
Okay.
I'm going.

02:07.910 --> 02:09.390
Good. Did you pack?

02:14.786 --> 02:17.920
Turns out, I don't have
a very ranch-friendly wardrobe.

02:17.963 --> 02:19.617
I mean, I don't think.

02:19.661 --> 02:21.489
My ranch references
are limited.

02:21.924 --> 02:24.056
Brokeback Mountain Little House on the Prairie

02:24.100 --> 02:27.277
And that other telenovela...
Cavalgando el Amor.

02:27.321 --> 02:28.365
Oh my God, Yes!

02:30.585 --> 02:34.154
I wanted Victor
to lasso me.

02:34.197 --> 02:36.591
Oh-- So, what do I bring?

02:37.809 --> 02:39.376
Uh, some yoga pants and
some tennis shoes, and...

02:39.420 --> 02:41.030
ROGELIO:
All the fringe!

02:43.511 --> 02:47.558
I cleaned out the wardrobe
storeroom of my production

02:47.602 --> 02:49.778
El Rancho de mi Corazon,
and I have everything you need.

02:49.821 --> 02:51.910
Suede fringe vest,

02:51.954 --> 02:54.826
chaps, and several
hat options.

02:56.263 --> 02:57.612
Isn't that a little, uh...

02:57.655 --> 02:59.266
Masculine? Yes.

02:59.309 --> 03:00.745
Which is why

03:00.789 --> 03:03.487
I also brought this.I can't wear that.

03:03.531 --> 03:07.796
But it's what all the women
in my telenovela wore.

03:24.943 --> 03:27.946
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And so, friends,
following in the footsteps

03:27.990 --> 03:32.299
of the telenovela ranchera...
let's meet our heroine.

03:40.524 --> 03:42.134
Howdy.

03:42.178 --> 03:44.006
Wow, so they really do
say that in Montana?

03:44.049 --> 03:45.442
No, I was just
reading your hat.

03:45.486 --> 03:48.358
Oh.

03:48.402 --> 03:52.232
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And of course,
her love interest.

03:56.801 --> 03:58.760
MICHAEL: Ready to go?

03:58.803 --> 04:01.328
Yeah, I think so.

04:01.371 --> 04:02.894
It's just three days.

04:02.938 --> 04:04.853
W-- I didn't
have time to...

04:04.896 --> 04:06.420
To make a color-coded
packing list?

04:07.421 --> 04:08.726
Anything you can leave here?

04:08.770 --> 04:10.554
Possibly, but I don't know what.

04:10.598 --> 04:11.555
Never mind.

04:11.599 --> 04:12.730
We'll take it all.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.166
Now, come on, let's go.

04:14.210 --> 04:15.646
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And so it was

04:15.690 --> 04:18.170
that these two
began their journey west.

04:18.214 --> 04:20.390
To Miami International Airport.

04:20.434 --> 04:23.567
Don't worry.

04:23.611 --> 04:25.482
There are no
expectations here.

04:25.526 --> 04:28.093
Plenty of hope. But
no expectations.

04:28.137 --> 04:30.879
Right. Right.
We'll just go with the flow.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.054
Exactly.

04:32.097 --> 04:34.535
See how we fit. With
no distractions.

04:34.578 --> 04:35.666
Sounds good.

04:35.710 --> 04:36.667
Open mind.

04:36.711 --> 04:39.496
Wide open.

04:46.155 --> 04:47.417
I'm really sorry
we had to wait

04:47.461 --> 04:48.766
for my luggage and
we missed our bus.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.115
You don't have
to apologize again.

04:50.159 --> 04:51.595
I do because
you're still mad.

04:51.639 --> 04:53.423
I'm not still mad.
I just thought that maybe

04:53.467 --> 04:54.903
if you'd consolidated
the bags

04:54.946 --> 04:56.252
before we left...Okay, so how
is that not mad?

04:56.296 --> 04:57.601
Okay.
It's fine.

04:57.645 --> 04:58.907
It's a bump in the road.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.300
We'll just buy
another ticket.

05:04.521 --> 05:06.828
Y'all need a ride?
Hop on in.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.614
We cannot hitchhike.

05:10.658 --> 05:12.442
What do you mean?What do youmean?

05:12.486 --> 05:13.704
Well, it would save us
60 bucks in bus tickets.

05:13.748 --> 05:15.315
This trip is costing a lot.

05:15.358 --> 05:17.055
Well, if we get in that truck,
it could cost us our lives!

05:17.099 --> 05:18.318
Okay. Can you just
give us a min...

05:18.361 --> 05:19.667
MICHAEL:
Bye. Thank you.

05:20.929 --> 05:23.845
Well, might as well
just get comfy.

05:23.888 --> 05:25.325
Be waiting here
for a while.

05:42.385 --> 05:44.039
How much longer?

05:44.082 --> 05:45.170
About an hour.

05:45.214 --> 05:46.563
But you can sleep
in tomorrow.

05:46.607 --> 05:49.566
No, I have to call
Mateo before school.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.525
That's gonna be tough.

05:51.568 --> 05:54.658
Cell service on the ranch
is pretty spotty.
What?

05:54.702 --> 05:56.356
Pretty much a dead zone.

05:56.399 --> 05:57.835
So how do I
call Mateo?

05:57.879 --> 06:00.011
I thought when you said
you were okay

06:00.055 --> 06:01.230
with leaving for a few days...

06:01.273 --> 06:03.363
That I wouldn't need
to call my son?

06:03.406 --> 06:04.712
I guess I'm just
used to being

06:04.755 --> 06:06.017
off the grid
for so long.

06:06.061 --> 06:07.802
I-I'll... think
of something.

06:07.845 --> 06:09.151
Don't get mad again.

06:09.194 --> 06:10.674
I'm not mad.

06:10.718 --> 06:13.285
I... It's fine.

06:13.329 --> 06:14.765
It's just an-another
bump in the...

06:15.810 --> 06:17.420
Ooh.
Whoa, what?

06:17.464 --> 06:19.291
What was that?

06:19.335 --> 06:20.292
I'd say a possum.

06:20.336 --> 06:21.946
W-What should we do?

06:21.990 --> 06:24.514
Well, we could swing back
around and pick it up.

06:24.558 --> 06:25.689
To help it?

06:25.733 --> 06:26.864
No, to eat it.

06:26.908 --> 06:28.562
They make a
mean pot pie.

06:28.605 --> 06:29.824
Mm-hmm.

06:29.867 --> 06:32.783
I'm kidding.

06:32.827 --> 06:35.003
Just kidding.

06:35.046 --> 06:37.527
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah. I have a feeling
he wasn't kidding.

06:39.486 --> 06:43.794
The point is that finally,
finally, they arrived.

06:45.796 --> 06:46.754
Here it is.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.538
My humble abode.

06:48.582 --> 06:50.366
I'll say.

06:50.410 --> 06:54.544
Wow. It's--
This is, uh, cozy.

06:54.588 --> 06:56.851
Come on. What do
you really think

06:56.894 --> 06:58.156
of life off the grid?

06:58.200 --> 07:01.769
We're here to learn
about each other.

07:01.812 --> 07:02.900
There's no point
in any of this

07:02.944 --> 07:03.901
if we're not
gonna be honest.

07:03.945 --> 07:05.947
Okay.

07:08.602 --> 07:11.474
I'm trying to go with the flow
and not get ahead of myself,

07:11.518 --> 07:14.085
but I can't imagine living
in the middle of nowhere,

07:14.129 --> 07:17.262
and eating roadkill and
picking up hitchhikers.

07:17.306 --> 07:19.917
I'm sorry.

07:19.961 --> 07:21.092
No, I asked.

07:21.136 --> 07:26.446
Look... we've had
a long day.

07:26.489 --> 07:28.273
Let's just go to bed.

07:28.317 --> 07:30.624
Okay. Yeah.

07:30.667 --> 07:33.278
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well, they learned one thing
about each other...

07:33.322 --> 07:35.324
they're not great
travel companions.

08:15.146 --> 08:17.975
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And so our heroine
went to bed troubled.

08:18.019 --> 08:20.500
As heroines often do.

08:24.765 --> 08:26.767
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And the next morning...

08:35.515 --> 08:37.647
...it was no better.

08:37.691 --> 08:40.563
And so Jane wondered if she
should just cut her losses

08:40.607 --> 08:43.871
and tell Michael
she had made a big mistake.

08:43.914 --> 08:45.916
Morning, Bo.

08:57.014 --> 08:59.016
Welcome to Montana.

09:10.462 --> 09:11.420
JANE:
Wow.

09:11.463 --> 09:14.336
Coffee never tasted so good.

09:14.379 --> 09:16.338
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Agreed.
I haven't been up this early

09:16.381 --> 09:18.862
since the other night,
when I was out this late.

09:18.906 --> 09:20.734
So, there's a landline
in the main house.

09:20.777 --> 09:22.431
And I asked the owner,
and he said

09:22.474 --> 09:23.911
you can use it
to call Mateo.

09:23.954 --> 09:26.740
Anytime. I also
called your grandma

09:26.783 --> 09:28.742
and gave her
this number.

09:28.785 --> 09:31.658
And she's gonna make sure
that Rafael has it.

09:31.701 --> 09:33.834
Thank you.

09:33.877 --> 09:36.619
Of course.

09:36.663 --> 09:37.751
I'm sorry
about yesterday.

09:37.794 --> 09:39.927
Long trip, short nerves.

09:39.970 --> 09:41.885
Me, too.

09:41.929 --> 09:44.627
But you know what?

09:44.671 --> 09:47.456
It's a new day.It is.

09:47.499 --> 09:49.327
And a beautiful one at that.

09:50.633 --> 09:53.201
I'm glad you think so.

09:53.244 --> 09:55.116
Thought we'd go
for a walk.

09:55.159 --> 09:56.378
Maybe have a picnic?

09:56.421 --> 09:58.772
Sounds perfect.

09:58.815 --> 10:01.644
Thanks for the shirt.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.298
Looks good on you.Hmm.

10:03.341 --> 10:06.475
Just wish I had a pair
of boots in your size.

10:06.518 --> 10:09.043
The sooner you get those things
caked in mud, the better.

10:09.086 --> 10:12.481
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But they're so sparkly.

10:12.524 --> 10:15.266
Heh, nice.
T here you go.

10:15.310 --> 10:17.791
Where's the picnic?
I want to hit all the mud.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.357
Just at the foot
of those hills.

10:20.750 --> 10:21.969
If we're trying
to get over there,

10:22.012 --> 10:23.318
why are we walking
this way?

10:23.361 --> 10:25.320
Got to bypass the
neighboring ranch.

10:25.363 --> 10:28.671
Because?Charlie lives there.

10:28.715 --> 10:29.672
Not a fan.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.718
Wait a second.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.328
Rival ranchers?

10:33.371 --> 10:35.635
Ooh-hoo-hoo.

10:35.678 --> 10:37.506
This is like Cavalgando el Amor.

10:37.549 --> 10:39.726
Did your fight start
over a beautiful

10:39.769 --> 10:41.989
ranch owner's daughter
who actually might be

10:42.032 --> 10:43.033
your twin sister?

10:43.077 --> 10:44.339
Oh, nothing
that dramatic.

10:44.382 --> 10:45.775
Aw...Just some bad blood.

10:45.819 --> 10:47.690
But enough
about Charlie.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.779
I want to focus on
our day together.

10:49.823 --> 10:51.694
Me, too.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.217
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And so, friends...

10:53.261 --> 10:55.785
...Jane let herself enjoy
the wind in her hair

10:55.829 --> 10:57.787
and the sun on her face.

10:57.831 --> 10:59.310
MAN:
What the hell?

10:59.354 --> 11:02.444
Jason, you didn't
tell me you were back.

11:07.014 --> 11:10.452
Actually,
I go by Michael now, sir.

11:10.495 --> 11:12.672
I don't care if you go
by Tammy Wynette.

11:12.715 --> 11:14.499
As long as you're back
and ready to work.

11:14.543 --> 11:17.677
Right. See, I was actually
just wondering if I could

11:17.720 --> 11:18.852
take a couple days.

11:20.157 --> 11:21.811
I'm sorry,

11:21.855 --> 11:24.118
I thought I just heard you
ask for more time off.

11:24.161 --> 11:27.077
You're living in that cabin,
you're earning your keep.

11:27.121 --> 11:29.732
Catch up on your chores today,
then get on out

11:29.776 --> 11:32.779
to that east border fence,
which needs fixing.

11:32.822 --> 11:34.563
And don't let her
get in the way.

11:36.478 --> 11:38.306
JANE:
Wow.

11:38.349 --> 11:39.916
Friendly guy.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.266
Sorry about that.
That's just how he is.

11:42.310 --> 11:44.442
Why don't you head
back to the cabin

11:44.486 --> 11:46.618
and write or relax,
and I'll finish up my work.

11:46.662 --> 11:48.185
We can have our picnic later.

11:48.229 --> 11:51.449
No way. I came here
to get to know your world.

11:51.493 --> 11:52.929
Put me to work, partner.

11:52.973 --> 11:54.844
Okay, then.
Come on.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.803
I'll introduce you to Shelby.

11:56.846 --> 11:59.719
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Huh? Who's this Shelby?

11:59.762 --> 12:02.809
So you're Shelby.

12:02.852 --> 12:04.375
Hope you've been taking
good care of Michael

12:04.419 --> 12:05.768
these last few years.

12:05.812 --> 12:08.466
Yeah, she did.
Right, old girl?

12:08.510 --> 12:10.817
I think they miss you,
Michael.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.993
Are they smiling?
What are their names?

12:13.036 --> 12:16.170
Oh, this is Ginger.
She's stubborn as a mule,

12:16.213 --> 12:17.388
but don't let her know that.

12:17.432 --> 12:18.955
She'll get offended.

12:18.999 --> 12:21.088
Banjo over here is lazy
as all get-out.

12:21.131 --> 12:23.351
He doesn't care who knows it.

12:23.394 --> 12:26.441
But Shelby is my best friend
on the ranch.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.095
After Bo, of course.

12:33.709 --> 12:37.582
Did you miss it in Miami,
hanging out with the horses?

12:37.626 --> 12:42.326
Yeah, I did a little bit.

12:42.370 --> 12:44.198
Except I didn't just
hang out with horses.

12:44.241 --> 12:45.808
I worked.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.114
You ready?

12:47.157 --> 12:48.593
Yeah. Totally.
What are we doing?

12:48.637 --> 12:49.899
Brushing them, feeding them,

12:49.943 --> 12:51.640
training them?

12:51.683 --> 12:53.033
We're mucking stalls.

12:53.076 --> 12:54.469
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, crap.

12:54.512 --> 12:55.905
You scoop the soiled straw,

12:55.949 --> 12:58.778
throw it in the wheelbarrow.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.170
You sure you wanna do this?

13:00.214 --> 13:02.520
Yep. It's like a...

13:02.564 --> 13:04.871
giant litter box, right?

13:04.914 --> 13:06.873
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And so our heroine
scooped poop.

13:06.916 --> 13:10.180
And, lo and behold,
her boots were broken in.

13:10.224 --> 13:11.878
How you doing?

13:11.921 --> 13:13.880
Getting my cardio in.

13:13.923 --> 13:15.969
Ah, six down,
six more to go.

13:16.012 --> 13:17.492
You sure you don't want
to take a break,

13:17.535 --> 13:18.885
and I'll finish up?
You kidding?

13:18.928 --> 13:20.669
I'm mucking circles
around these stalls.

13:27.719 --> 13:30.331
Hey!

13:31.723 --> 13:33.247
What was that for?

13:33.290 --> 13:34.988
You threw it first.

13:35.031 --> 13:36.119
I didn't mean to.

13:36.163 --> 13:38.687
Oh, I...

13:38.730 --> 13:40.820
thought you were starting
a hay fight.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.343
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ha! Please.

13:42.386 --> 13:43.648
That only happens
in a telenovela.

13:43.692 --> 13:44.998
I wasn't.

13:45.041 --> 13:46.608
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Then again...

13:46.651 --> 13:48.436
But I am now!

13:57.575 --> 13:59.534
Whoa!

14:07.934 --> 14:11.546
All right, now I even smell
like a ranch hand.

14:11.589 --> 14:14.201
Come on, I'll show you a spot
where you can get cleaned up.

14:14.244 --> 14:16.116
Oh, uh...

14:20.947 --> 14:22.557
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well, that's about eight hours

14:22.600 --> 14:24.559
too late.

14:37.964 --> 14:40.096
Think of it as
a low-flow shower.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.142
All you gotta do is
pull this rope,

14:42.185 --> 14:43.883
but pull it gently,
or you'll end up

14:43.926 --> 14:47.103
dumping the whole bucket
on your head.

14:47.147 --> 14:48.322
Got it.

14:48.365 --> 14:50.890
I'll wait over there for you.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.479
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
To be fair,

15:15.523 --> 15:16.916
it's hard to go with the flow,

15:16.959 --> 15:18.178
if the flow won't go.

15:18.221 --> 15:20.571
Michael!
Michael, are you there?

15:20.615 --> 15:22.008
What's up?

15:22.051 --> 15:24.184
Uh, I'm having trouble
working this.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.012
Do you want me to
hold the rope for you?

15:26.055 --> 15:27.927
As long as you don't look.

15:27.970 --> 15:30.755
I won't.
I promise.

15:53.126 --> 15:55.302
Okay.

15:56.825 --> 15:58.218
You can look now.

16:00.089 --> 16:02.178
Thanks for that.

16:02.222 --> 16:04.659
You're welcome.

16:07.357 --> 16:09.098
Okay, I'm--
I'm gonna change.

16:09.142 --> 16:11.231
Okay.

16:14.582 --> 16:16.366
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well...

16:16.410 --> 16:18.629
...that was hot.

16:22.329 --> 16:23.983
Hey, now.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.288
Look who's back.Hey...

16:25.332 --> 16:26.637
Where you been, man?We missed you, man.

16:26.681 --> 16:29.814
Jane, this is Keith,
my right-hand man.

16:29.858 --> 16:32.339
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well, hello, Keith.

16:37.344 --> 16:39.346
Don't believe that.
He's myright-hand man.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.565
And you are?Jane.

16:41.609 --> 16:44.003
Well, right this way, Jane.
Have yourself a seat.

16:44.046 --> 16:46.570
Someone get this little lady
a beer.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.748
Now, tell us...

16:50.792 --> 16:52.011
how in the hell
did old Jason here

16:52.054 --> 16:54.013
talk you into a date?

16:54.056 --> 16:56.145
You are finer than
a frog's hair split four ways.

16:56.189 --> 16:58.887
Thank you?

16:58.930 --> 17:00.149
Actually,
Jane's not my date.

17:00.193 --> 17:02.195
She's my wife.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.285
You're kidding.
No way.

17:05.328 --> 17:07.330
Come on, how much
is he paying you?

17:07.374 --> 17:10.855
Oh, it's... it is true.
I'm his wife.

17:10.899 --> 17:13.032
But it's a little more
complicated than that.

17:14.468 --> 17:16.557
Uh, my name's actually
not Jason.

17:16.600 --> 17:17.819
It's Michael Cordero.

17:17.862 --> 17:20.343
And I was a cop in Miami.

17:20.387 --> 17:22.998
A detective, actually.
A great one.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.739
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well, that's debatable. It's a pretty wild story

17:24.782 --> 17:26.480
I'll tell you guys
when we have more time.

17:26.523 --> 17:29.091
Hey, come on, we got
nothing but time.

17:29.135 --> 17:31.006
You guys want a campfire story?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.138
KEITH:
Yeah.

17:32.181 --> 17:34.096
I got a crazy one for you.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.579
Holy hell.

17:38.622 --> 17:40.146
I know, it's...
it's really a crazy story.

17:40.189 --> 17:41.495
The craziest part
wasn't the story,

17:41.538 --> 17:43.149
it's the fact that Jason here--

17:43.192 --> 17:45.934
I mean Michael-- told it.

17:45.977 --> 17:47.109
No one's ever heard him
string more than

17:47.153 --> 17:48.632
two sentences together
at one time.

17:48.676 --> 17:50.547
And you got a sense of humor?

17:50.591 --> 17:52.810
Who knew?
RANCH HAND: I gotta say,

17:52.854 --> 17:54.943
that's damn near the most
romantic thing I've heard

17:54.986 --> 17:56.814
since Luke Bryan's
new album.

17:56.858 --> 17:59.991
KEITH: So, what's the ending
to this fairy tale?

18:00.035 --> 18:02.298
Jane, you gonna move out here
and become a ranch wife?

18:04.300 --> 18:05.301
MICHAEL:
Uh, we're gonna
take it slow.

18:05.345 --> 18:07.260
One step at a time.

18:07.303 --> 18:09.784
So, what'd I miss
around here?

18:09.827 --> 18:11.438
KEITH:
Ooh, where do I start?

18:11.481 --> 18:13.440
Well, Steve broke his leg...

18:13.483 --> 18:16.225
Okay, so, Mateo and I
are going to Montana

18:16.269 --> 18:18.271
to live with Michael,
and I was hoping that

18:18.314 --> 18:19.968
you can move there, too,
so we can co-parent.

18:20.011 --> 18:22.971
Maybe you could open up
a boutique hotel there.

18:23.014 --> 18:25.234
Serve up some possum pie.

18:25.278 --> 18:26.453
MICHAEL:
Jane?

18:26.496 --> 18:29.151
You okay?

18:29.195 --> 18:32.459
Mm. Sorry. I, uh,
just have to go to the bathroom.

18:38.856 --> 18:41.076
Oh.

18:43.644 --> 18:45.167
XIOMARA :
Hi, Janie.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.256
Ma. Oh, thank God.
We keep missing each other.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.649
I know I said things
were getting better,

18:48.692 --> 18:50.172
but now I'm panicking again.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.608
Somebody just asked us
about our future together,

18:51.652 --> 18:53.132
and I need you to talk me down.

18:53.175 --> 18:54.481
Ma?

18:54.524 --> 18:57.527
Ugh! Ah!

19:10.018 --> 19:11.889
RICK:
So... staying or leaving?

19:13.543 --> 19:15.589
What do you mean?Well, I hear that girl's

19:15.632 --> 19:16.590
your wife.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.635
She is clearly not staying here.

19:20.028 --> 19:21.856
Now, AJ's been doing
a real good job

19:21.899 --> 19:23.814
taking over for you.

19:23.858 --> 19:27.035
You leave, I want to
hold on to him.

19:27.078 --> 19:29.342
So, what's it gonna be?

19:29.385 --> 19:33.346
Well, I don't know, sir.
It all just happened.

19:33.389 --> 19:36.479
You got 48 hours to decide.

19:46.924 --> 19:48.926
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
So, here we are,

19:48.970 --> 19:51.146
with these two at a crossroads.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.888
You okay? You been
out there for a while.

19:53.931 --> 19:56.325
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Remember, Jane, honesty...

19:56.369 --> 19:58.240
Yeah, great.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.895
Just looking for
the right bush, for peeing.

20:00.938 --> 20:02.462
Everything okay?

20:02.505 --> 20:03.898
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
All right, Michael,

20:03.941 --> 20:06.205
here's your chance:
honesty.

20:07.771 --> 20:09.643
Yeah. Just wanted to remind you

20:09.686 --> 20:11.949
about the fence
we have to fix tomorrow.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.168
Honestly?

20:13.212 --> 20:14.735
Speaking of,
we got to wake up early.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.563
Should we hit the hay?

20:16.606 --> 20:19.000
Good idea. I am wiped out.

20:19.043 --> 20:20.436
Okay.

20:28.357 --> 20:30.011
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
There comes a time
in every relationship

20:30.054 --> 20:31.795
and in every
telenovelaranchera

20:31.839 --> 20:34.798
when fences must be mended.

20:34.842 --> 20:36.322
Literally, in this case.

20:36.365 --> 20:38.062
Okay, here's the plan.

20:38.106 --> 20:41.370
We ride out to the fence, fix
any spots that are worn out,

20:41.414 --> 20:43.242
close up potential
escape routes.

20:43.285 --> 20:44.808
Sounds good.

20:44.852 --> 20:46.549
Why do you look
so nervous?

20:46.593 --> 20:49.204
I've only ridden a horse once,
and it-it wasn't pretty.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.988
Aw, don't worry.
You'll ride Shelby.

20:51.032 --> 20:53.121
She knows the fence
line better than me.

20:53.164 --> 20:55.254
I'll get her.
Be right back.
Okay.

20:57.473 --> 20:59.649
KEITH:
Hey there, little lady.

20:59.693 --> 21:00.781
Sleep well?

21:00.824 --> 21:02.870
Still like that guy?

21:02.913 --> 21:04.350
I did sleep well.
And yes, I do.

21:04.393 --> 21:06.656
So, did you guys make a decision
about Rick's deadline?

21:06.700 --> 21:08.049
What deadline?

21:08.092 --> 21:10.312
Uh-oh. Did I
just step in it?

21:10.356 --> 21:13.707
I'll assume "it" refers to the
stuff Jane scooped yesterday.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.665
What are we deciding?Dinner. Chicken or ribs.

21:15.709 --> 21:18.929
Keith, don't make
this little lady angry.

21:20.931 --> 21:24.065
Rick gave him 48 hours to decide
if he's staying on the ranch

21:24.108 --> 21:25.719
or leaving.

21:25.762 --> 21:27.155
Got it.

21:27.198 --> 21:28.548
Good to know.

21:38.122 --> 21:39.994
You doing okay, Jane?

21:40.037 --> 21:41.909
Yup, I'm great!

21:41.952 --> 21:44.738
No way. Horses pick up
on the rider's anxiety.

21:44.781 --> 21:47.088
You're making
Shelby skittish.

21:47.131 --> 21:48.524
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Shelby, you traitor!

21:48.568 --> 21:50.526
Keith told me
about Rick's ultimatum.

21:50.570 --> 21:51.919
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Keith, you traitor!

21:51.962 --> 21:54.008
I thought we were gonna be
honest with each other.

21:54.051 --> 21:55.357
Why didn't you tell me?

21:55.401 --> 21:58.491
I guess I saw
your reaction

21:58.534 --> 22:00.928
to Keith's question
about our future,

22:00.971 --> 22:04.192
and I knew this deadline
would add even more pressure.

22:04.235 --> 22:07.369
Yeah, you're right, it does.
I mean...

22:07.413 --> 22:09.284
I-I-I can't
live here.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.503
I know that.

22:10.546 --> 22:12.418
And I'm not ready
to ask you to move,

22:12.461 --> 22:15.595
or-or lose a job that you like
with people that you like.

22:15.638 --> 22:17.597
I know that, too,
but here's the thing,

22:17.640 --> 22:20.208
I've been thinking and there's
more than only two options.

22:20.251 --> 22:22.428
We could decide
to date,

22:22.471 --> 22:24.647
do the whole
long distance thing,

22:24.691 --> 22:27.433
visit each other,
see where things go.

22:27.476 --> 22:31.001
I didn't think about that.See?

22:31.045 --> 22:32.438
It's not all or nothing.

22:32.481 --> 22:34.135
I could keep
my job now,

22:34.178 --> 22:36.137
you could head home,

22:36.180 --> 22:38.792
I could figure out
that whole FaceTime thing,

22:38.835 --> 22:42.143
and we could take
our time to decide.

22:42.186 --> 22:45.189
I like that option.

22:47.453 --> 22:50.673
I want my own horse,
a stallion!

22:50.717 --> 22:52.327
This is 100% your fault.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.024
MICHAEL: Let's maybe learn
how to ride first,

22:54.068 --> 22:56.462
Mateo. Next time you come out
here, I'll teach you.

22:56.505 --> 22:59.856
Yeah!Hey, bud, you ready to go?

23:04.339 --> 23:05.688
MICHAEL:
Uh-oh, what happened?

23:05.732 --> 23:07.690
Huh?

23:07.734 --> 23:10.127
You were feeling better,
now Shelby's jumpy.

23:10.171 --> 23:12.782
Geez, I didn't realize horses
doubled as lie detectors.

23:12.826 --> 23:14.567
Plus, I can see it
on your face.

23:16.612 --> 23:19.615
Honesty. Okay.

23:19.659 --> 23:22.575
I feel guilty about Rafael and
what I'm putting him through,

23:22.618 --> 23:24.838
and I can't stop
thinking about him.

23:24.881 --> 23:26.840
Gotcha.

23:26.883 --> 23:29.712
You wanted to know.I did, and I do.

23:29.756 --> 23:31.584
But what are you
supposed to do?

23:31.627 --> 23:33.716
I mean, your husband
came back from the dead.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.326
It's all...

23:35.370 --> 23:38.329
Straight out of
a telenovela? I know.

23:38.373 --> 23:42.377
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I couldn't have said it
better myself.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.031
See that?

23:44.074 --> 23:46.729
Shelby's feeling better,
which means you are, too.

23:46.773 --> 23:50.733
Better to talk
about it.
Agreed.

23:50.777 --> 23:54.476
Now let's make these horses
earn their supper. Come on.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.783
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
So with her mind at ease,

23:56.826 --> 23:59.307
Jane rode across
the countryside.

23:59.350 --> 24:01.788
Hyah!

24:05.444 --> 24:08.098
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Sorry, I couldn't resist.

24:11.798 --> 24:14.235
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Sure looks
like they mended their fence.

24:14.278 --> 24:17.064
Then you take the new wire,
wrap it around the brace post,

24:17.107 --> 24:19.283
but make sure it's really tight.Mm-hmm.

24:19.327 --> 24:20.502
And then staple.

24:20.546 --> 24:21.895
Okay, got it.

24:21.938 --> 24:24.419
Are you sure? Want me to
go over it one more time?

24:24.463 --> 24:27.248
Come on, Villanueva women
know how to fix stuff.

24:27.291 --> 24:29.163
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
True, for the record.

24:33.472 --> 24:37.301
Look at that. I forgot how good
you were with your hands.

24:37.345 --> 24:40.435
Thanks.

24:40.479 --> 24:43.090
If you don't watch out, I might
be working you out of a job.

24:43.133 --> 24:46.223
Like your fancy Miami manicure
could hold up here.

24:46.267 --> 24:48.617
Bull...
No, seriously,
you don't think...

24:48.661 --> 24:50.314
No, bull! Right there!

24:50.358 --> 24:53.230
Holy crap, that was Rocky!Who's Rocky?

24:58.584 --> 25:00.150
MICHAEL: He's the ranch's
prize breeding bull.

25:00.194 --> 25:02.675
His semen's worth
$2,000 a vial,

25:02.718 --> 25:05.068
and he's paid to inseminate
thousands of cows a year.

25:05.112 --> 25:06.722
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wow, does anyone get pregnant

25:06.766 --> 25:08.594
the old-fashioned way
these days?

25:08.637 --> 25:10.857
If we don't get him back,
I'll lose my job.

25:10.900 --> 25:13.947
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And they will lose
their options.

25:15.209 --> 25:18.734
Wait! Wait for me!

25:25.698 --> 25:27.569
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Friends, we last left
our heroine

25:27.613 --> 25:29.528
in pursuit of a stud.Wait!

25:29.571 --> 25:34.010
Oh, Michael, wait for me!

25:36.796 --> 25:38.232
Oh, my God,
there he is.

25:38.275 --> 25:40.277
Okay, so what do we do?

25:40.321 --> 25:42.802
Lasso him? Is that,
is that a real thing

25:42.845 --> 25:44.847
or is that a TV thing?It's a real thing.

25:44.891 --> 25:46.153
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
So very real.

25:46.196 --> 25:48.242
Okay, so do it.

25:48.285 --> 25:50.592
Well, hang on. We can't
just waltz on over there.

25:50.636 --> 25:52.507
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah, geez, hold your horses.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.553
MICHAEL: That bull's
on Charlie's land.

25:54.596 --> 25:57.077
Ah, your nemesis.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.905
Come on, what's the worst
that could happen?

25:58.948 --> 26:01.647
Last time I got a sucker punch
to the face and a broken nose.

26:01.690 --> 26:05.999
And Charlie will shoot me
on the spot if I trespass again.

26:06.042 --> 26:07.783
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Jane, your options
are getting away.

26:07.827 --> 26:09.655
Well, Charlie's not gonna
sucker punch me.

26:09.698 --> 26:11.352
I'm gonna grab that bull
by the horns.

26:11.395 --> 26:13.180
Nope, definitely
don't do that.

26:13.223 --> 26:16.183
Lasso, then.
Teach me.

26:16.226 --> 26:19.447
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Whoa! You go, cowgirl.

26:19.490 --> 26:22.624
Oh, spoke too soon.

26:22.668 --> 26:25.105
Okay, try not
to throw it so much.

26:25.148 --> 26:27.150
It's more about releasing
the rope at the right time,

26:27.194 --> 26:29.675
and following through
on the swing.

26:31.502 --> 26:33.417
Good.

26:35.419 --> 26:37.117
Helps if you hold
onto the rope.

26:37.160 --> 26:39.728
Yup, got it,
good point.

26:45.429 --> 26:46.822
All right, follow through
on the swing.

26:46.866 --> 26:48.737
Mm-hmm.
Follow through
on the swing.

26:50.913 --> 26:52.654
Are you even
aiming for Bo?

26:52.698 --> 26:55.135
Stop it, I'm gonna get this.

26:55.178 --> 26:57.137
Okay. This is the one.

26:57.180 --> 26:58.704
Yup.I'm feeling it.

26:58.747 --> 27:00.706
Mm-hmm.Here we go.

27:05.275 --> 27:08.714
I did it!
I did it! I did it!

27:08.757 --> 27:11.499
All right, so listen,
Rocky's real gentle,

27:11.542 --> 27:13.457
but just in case
something goes wrong.

27:13.501 --> 27:15.459
I get it, blow the horn
and it'll scare him away.

27:15.503 --> 27:16.809
No, it'll stun him,

27:16.852 --> 27:18.593
maybe give you enough time
to climb up a tree.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.943
Also, try to stand near a tree.

27:20.987 --> 27:22.684
You got this.

27:34.348 --> 27:37.133
Okay.

27:37.177 --> 27:40.310
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, geez, just throw it
already.

27:40.354 --> 27:41.660
I can't watch.

27:44.010 --> 27:46.447
Nice aim.

27:46.490 --> 27:49.624
Oh, I am so sorry.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.671
I... I thought
you were a bull.

27:54.324 --> 27:55.935
I'm not from here.LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Clearly.

27:55.978 --> 27:57.545
A-And I just needed
to get the bull back

27:57.588 --> 27:58.938
before Charlie finds out
that I'm on his property.

27:58.981 --> 28:00.287
I hear he's not the nicest.

28:00.330 --> 28:02.332
Yeah, Charlie's mean
as cat meat.

28:02.376 --> 28:04.508
Who warned you?Michael, his neighbor.

28:04.552 --> 28:06.728
Or, I guess, Charlie
knows him by Jason.

28:06.772 --> 28:10.819
It-It's a whole thing.
I'm Jane, by the way.

28:10.863 --> 28:12.691
I'm Charlie.

28:29.838 --> 28:31.797
Listen, I'm really sorry.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.234
Do you even know why
Jason and I don't get along?

28:34.277 --> 28:35.583
Uh, not exactly.

28:35.626 --> 28:37.890
'Cause he's a thief,
a nibbler,

28:37.933 --> 28:40.544
belongs in the calaboose.Okay, um, I...

28:40.588 --> 28:43.460
I don't even know what some of
that means, but I can tell you,

28:43.504 --> 28:45.158
he's not a thief. I know him.

28:45.201 --> 28:47.464
Yeah, so do I, unfortunately.

28:47.508 --> 28:50.729
Okay, uh, l-look, I-I hope
you guys can work this out,

28:50.772 --> 28:52.774
but right now I need
to get that bull back

28:52.818 --> 28:55.037
or Michael will lose his job,
and my options will disappear

28:55.081 --> 28:56.735
and I can't let
that happen right now.

28:56.778 --> 28:58.998
Your options?
Please.
I came 3,000 miles

28:59.041 --> 29:02.305
and I took a plane and a bus
and a truck and hit a possum

29:02.349 --> 29:04.177
and left my son at home,
all to see if there's

29:04.220 --> 29:06.353
still something between Michael
and me, and the only way

29:06.396 --> 29:08.529
I can do that without
panicking is to know

29:08.572 --> 29:10.226
that I have options
and he has options

29:10.270 --> 29:12.228
and our options depend on
getting that freaking bull back.

29:17.059 --> 29:19.496
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, my God, there she is.

29:19.540 --> 29:20.889
What a heroine!

29:24.240 --> 29:25.415
Whoo!

29:25.459 --> 29:28.027
How'd you do it?Charlie gave me a hand.

29:28.070 --> 29:30.203
You got her to help you? How?

29:30.246 --> 29:32.031
Once she understood
our situation,

29:32.074 --> 29:33.989
she was happy to help.

29:34.033 --> 29:36.209
If I lasso that bull,
will you shut your trap

29:36.252 --> 29:37.732
and get the hell off
my property?

29:37.776 --> 29:40.866
Wow. You really earned
your spurs.

29:40.909 --> 29:44.173
Ah. We should get back to the
cabin, my spurs are tired.

29:44.217 --> 29:45.392
Yeah, about that.

29:45.435 --> 29:48.047
We kind of missed the moment.

29:48.090 --> 29:50.049
It's gonna be dark
before we can make it back.

29:50.092 --> 29:53.182
What?We'll have to camp.

29:53.226 --> 29:54.880
But we don't have a tent.

29:54.923 --> 29:58.231
No, but we got snacks
and saddle blankets.

29:59.972 --> 30:02.583
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Snacks, saddle blankets,

30:02.626 --> 30:04.933
and most importantly,
her options.

30:04.977 --> 30:06.761
All right, let's camp.

30:09.459 --> 30:11.810
The Miami sky
ain't got nothing on this.

30:11.853 --> 30:14.900
Right?

30:14.943 --> 30:16.902
These are my favorite
kind of nights.

30:16.945 --> 30:21.080
Warm breeze, starry skies,

30:21.123 --> 30:25.258
nothing but you on Earth.Yeah.

30:25.301 --> 30:27.738
What did it feel like
to be in Miami

30:27.782 --> 30:30.132
after calling
this place home?

30:30.176 --> 30:33.570
Hot, mostly.

30:33.614 --> 30:35.572
Your heart beats faster there,
for sure.

30:35.616 --> 30:38.488
In a good way?I don't know.

30:38.532 --> 30:41.100
Could you ever see yourself
living there again?

30:41.143 --> 30:43.145
I don't know that, either.

30:45.974 --> 30:49.282
But I am happy
to be here with you now,

30:49.325 --> 30:52.285
showing you Montana.

30:52.328 --> 30:53.808
I'm happy, too.

30:53.852 --> 30:58.160
And I can see why
you love it here.

30:58.204 --> 31:02.121
I really do. You can just...

31:02.164 --> 31:04.601
hear yourself think, you know?

31:04.645 --> 31:05.907
Do you ever wonder

31:05.951 --> 31:08.823
if this was you
underneath it all?

31:08.867 --> 31:10.651
The cowboy who
likes the quiet.

31:10.694 --> 31:15.177
All the time,
but I don't think it is.

31:15.221 --> 31:20.139
I was happy, I know that.

31:20.182 --> 31:23.969
It's just hard to figure out
what was me then

31:24.012 --> 31:26.362
and what's me now.

31:26.406 --> 31:29.104
Yeah. You did always
did love camping.

31:29.148 --> 31:30.671
Well, you, too.

31:30.714 --> 31:32.281
That's how we
first bonded, right?

31:32.325 --> 31:33.674
Excuse me?

31:33.717 --> 31:35.937
Over our incredible
love of camping.

31:35.981 --> 31:37.808
Is my memory off?Mm-hmm.

31:37.852 --> 31:39.245
Oh, I'm thinking about
a different lady.

31:39.288 --> 31:42.422
Can't keep track.

31:42.465 --> 31:44.903
Oh, you were the one who
complained the entire time.

31:44.946 --> 31:46.556
Only because you
kept me up all night.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.428
I mean, every time
I tried to fall asleep,

31:48.471 --> 31:50.952
you'd bust out
your Yogi Bear impression.

31:50.996 --> 31:53.041
: What're
you talking about, Boo-Boo?

32:19.328 --> 32:20.721
Good night, Michael.

32:20.764 --> 32:22.766
Good night, Jane.

32:32.602 --> 32:34.039
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, that fresh Montana air,

32:34.082 --> 32:35.910
it helps you sleep so soundly.

32:37.520 --> 32:41.960
OMG! I forgot about
those Montana guns!

32:42.003 --> 32:43.613
What the hell
are you doing on my property?

32:43.657 --> 32:45.659
The deal was you shut up,
get the bull and beat it.

32:45.702 --> 32:48.314
I-I am so sorry. We didn't
realize this was your property.

32:48.357 --> 32:50.011
This isn't her property.
Your property ends

32:50.055 --> 32:51.447
at that tree line over there.

32:51.491 --> 32:52.535
I showed you the land records.

32:52.579 --> 32:54.320
I don't take the word
of a thief.

32:54.363 --> 32:56.104
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Can we maybe put the gun down

32:56.148 --> 32:57.105
and talk about this?

32:57.149 --> 32:59.238
W-What do you mean, "thief"?

32:59.281 --> 33:02.676
He stole my chickens.
Prize chickens.

33:02.719 --> 33:03.807
I didn't.Michael, shush...

33:03.851 --> 33:05.853
I always knew
he was shady.

33:05.896 --> 33:07.898
Show up out of nowhere,
no history, no family.

33:07.942 --> 33:10.858
I mean, he tells me his name's
Jason, tells you it's Michael.

33:10.901 --> 33:13.034
Honestly, I don't even know
what you're doing with him,

33:13.078 --> 33:15.341
unless... you're a thief, too.

33:15.384 --> 33:18.039
You-- He is not a thief,
and neither am I.

33:18.083 --> 33:20.868
What makes you so sure?Because I'm his wife.

33:20.911 --> 33:22.391
And he lost his memory,
but he used to be

33:22.435 --> 33:24.785
a detective, and he is
the best person I've known.

33:24.828 --> 33:28.354
Decent and kind and
honest and always looking

33:28.397 --> 33:29.703
to protect people
from getting hurt,

33:29.746 --> 33:31.531
and trying to do
the right thing,

33:31.574 --> 33:33.359
and taking care
of everyone.

33:33.402 --> 33:35.578
And so even though I don't know
what happened to your chickens,

33:35.622 --> 33:38.103
I can say for a fact that
Michael was not responsible.

33:38.146 --> 33:39.365
Right, Michael?

33:39.408 --> 33:42.063
Um... Actually, I was.What?

33:42.107 --> 33:44.065
But I didn't steal them.
Bo ate them.

33:44.109 --> 33:45.545
Why didn't you just say that?

33:45.588 --> 33:47.112
I couldn't.
She would have shot my dog.

33:47.155 --> 33:48.374
I am sure she wouldn't...You got that right.

33:48.417 --> 33:50.071
JANE: Stop pointing
that thing at things!

33:50.115 --> 33:51.768
Come on, there's got
to be a solution

33:51.812 --> 33:52.987
to this situation, right?

33:53.031 --> 33:54.554
Like, uh, u-uh,

33:54.597 --> 33:57.383
uh, what if Michael agrees
to replace your chickens?

33:57.426 --> 33:58.645
Prize chickens.

33:58.688 --> 34:00.081
Prize chickens. Right.

34:00.125 --> 34:01.648
And in exchange,

34:01.691 --> 34:03.476
you agree to not shoot him
or his dog

34:03.519 --> 34:05.260
if he accidentally trespasses
on your land.

34:06.522 --> 34:08.133
What do you say?

34:08.176 --> 34:09.612
We got a deal?

34:19.579 --> 34:22.843
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
OMG, who's gonna blink first?

34:30.720 --> 34:33.810
Fine. I'll give you
the benefit of the doubt.

34:33.854 --> 34:35.160
But you better get me
some quality chickens,

34:35.203 --> 34:37.075
not some scrawny old biddies.

34:37.118 --> 34:39.512
And if that mutt

34:39.555 --> 34:41.340
ever sets paw
on my property again,

34:41.383 --> 34:43.516
I'll turn him into an area rug,
you hear?

34:48.129 --> 34:51.654
Well, I don't think I'll be
needing coffee this morning.

34:51.698 --> 34:53.656
Thanks for standing up for me,

34:53.700 --> 34:56.006
and for saying
those nice things.

34:56.442 --> 34:57.878
You really feel
that way about me?

34:57.921 --> 35:00.359
Of course. You know that.

35:02.883 --> 35:04.841
Oh, who am I kidding?

35:04.885 --> 35:06.843
I don't want to stay here
without you.

35:06.887 --> 35:08.671
What?I love you, Jane,

35:08.715 --> 35:11.979
and these last two days
have only proven that to me,

35:12.022 --> 35:13.850
that there's still
a connection here.

35:13.894 --> 35:16.810
And if we're being honest--
which we said we would be--

35:16.853 --> 35:20.205
I don't want to do
long distance.

35:20.248 --> 35:21.858
I want to be with you.

35:21.902 --> 35:24.992
Move to Miami, and really try
to make this work.

35:25.035 --> 35:26.907
No. I can't ask you to do that.

35:26.950 --> 35:29.039
You're not.You love Montana,

35:29.083 --> 35:31.085
being able to hear
yourself think.

35:31.129 --> 35:34.567
And... and you gave up
so much for me before.

35:34.610 --> 35:37.047
Oh, I'd do the same for you now.

35:37.091 --> 35:38.875
I'd do anything for you.

35:38.919 --> 35:40.355
For us.

35:40.399 --> 35:42.357
Now, I'll stay here
if this is too much too soon,

35:42.401 --> 35:46.056
but I just want you to know,
that's where I'm at.

35:52.976 --> 35:55.370
Oh, I-I'm just gonna...

36:06.207 --> 36:08.166
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, finally some good timing.

36:12.387 --> 36:15.521
Hey.
Wow.

36:15.564 --> 36:17.349
Can't believe I'm shaking hands
with the salesman of the month.

36:17.392 --> 36:18.654
Congrats, buddy.

36:18.698 --> 36:20.178
Thank you. I was thinking

36:20.221 --> 36:21.918
we could have a family dinner
to celebrate.

36:21.962 --> 36:23.877
Sounds perfect.MATEO: Yeah, come on, Michael!

36:23.920 --> 36:26.009
All right.

36:27.446 --> 36:29.622
So you're okay?

36:29.665 --> 36:34.017
Yeah. I really am okay.

36:34.061 --> 36:36.846
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And it was there,
standing in the silence,

36:36.890 --> 36:38.935
that Jane realized
Michael was right.

36:38.979 --> 36:43.331
She really could
hear herself think.

36:43.375 --> 36:47.553
And friends, in that moment,
our heroine knew exactly

36:47.596 --> 36:49.598
what she had to do.

36:55.822 --> 36:59.913
Everything all right? You've
been out there for a while.

36:59.956 --> 37:03.743
You were right, Montana
is a good place for thinking.

37:03.786 --> 37:09.139
And I've been thinking about
how much you've changed

37:09.183 --> 37:10.967
and how much I've changed.

37:11.011 --> 37:15.494
I mean, I used to be someone
who clung so tightly to a plan,

37:15.537 --> 37:18.236
and then life threw me
all these crazy curveballs.

37:20.934 --> 37:24.720
Losing you was the biggest,

37:24.764 --> 37:26.722
and hardest one of all.

37:28.333 --> 37:31.161
I never thought
I'd get through it.

37:31.205 --> 37:35.383
I mean, after that,
I... I had to learn

37:35.427 --> 37:37.994
to let go of the plan a little.

37:38.038 --> 37:41.868
And listen to my heart.

37:41.911 --> 37:43.391
What's it telling you?

37:49.571 --> 37:51.530
Mm, this whole t-trip,

37:51.573 --> 37:54.489
I've been trying
to imagine a life with you.

37:54.533 --> 37:57.231
But every time I did,

37:57.275 --> 37:59.668
I felt guilty about Rafael.

37:59.712 --> 38:02.758
And then,
I suddenly realized

38:02.802 --> 38:04.804
it's not guilt...

38:08.155 --> 38:10.331
...it's love.

38:10.375 --> 38:12.681
The biggest change that happened
when you were gone

38:12.725 --> 38:15.641
is that I fell in love
with Rafael.

38:15.684 --> 38:19.732
And I'm still in love with him,
and that's not gonna change.

38:20.994 --> 38:26.173
Michael,
what you and I had was...

38:28.697 --> 38:30.699
It was.

38:36.096 --> 38:38.707
But I guess our moment's passed.

38:45.018 --> 38:48.369
I am so sorry.

38:48.413 --> 38:50.545
Don't be.

38:50.589 --> 38:52.808
This experience
with you on the ranch,

38:52.852 --> 38:58.031
and over the last few weeks,
you gave me my life back.

39:01.208 --> 39:03.645
I just want you to be happy.

39:03.689 --> 39:05.473
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Michael,
you're killing me here.

39:05.517 --> 39:08.781
I wish I knew how to quit you.

39:48.560 --> 39:51.171
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And so our heroine began

39:51.214 --> 39:53.042
her long journey home.

39:53.086 --> 39:55.436
As hard as it was
to leave Michael,

39:55.480 --> 39:58.308
Jane knew exactly
where she was going,

39:58.352 --> 40:00.528
exactly what she had to do,

40:00.572 --> 40:04.140
and exactly
who she had to talk to.

40:15.282 --> 40:18.241
What are you doing here?

40:18.285 --> 40:20.722
I thought you were picking up
Mateo tomorrow, he's asleep.

40:20.766 --> 40:22.463
I know.

40:22.507 --> 40:25.205
And I also know that you're not
happy with me right now,

40:25.248 --> 40:28.338
so this may not be the right
time, but I couldn't wait.

40:31.385 --> 40:33.474
I know I put us both
through hell

40:33.518 --> 40:35.302
because I didn't
tell Michael to leave.

40:35.345 --> 40:37.870
You were right.

40:37.913 --> 40:40.263
I had to explore it.
He was my husband.

40:40.307 --> 40:43.353
And I-I think a part of that
was the past lingering

40:43.397 --> 40:46.269
and part was shock

40:46.313 --> 40:48.489
and part was having
to say good-bye again.

40:48.533 --> 40:51.361
In a different way,
which I did.

40:51.405 --> 40:55.757
I said good-bye to Michael,
because I'm sure,

40:55.801 --> 40:59.587
more sure than I've ever been
about anything,

40:59.631 --> 41:02.590
that I want to be with you.

41:02.634 --> 41:06.072
Forever.

41:06.115 --> 41:11.164
You're my now, you're my
tomorrow, you're my always.

41:11.207 --> 41:13.601
I'm sorry.

41:13.645 --> 41:16.169
It's just...

41:16.212 --> 41:17.431
It's too late.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.259
Please, don't say that.

41:19.302 --> 41:22.610
I just don't
trust you anymore, Jane.

41:22.654 --> 41:25.744
And I can't go back.

41:25.787 --> 41:30.139
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And it looks like
their moment passed, too.

41:30.183 --> 41:34.361
And then he shut the
door, and that was it.

41:35.710 --> 41:38.539
It's okay. I'm okay.

41:38.583 --> 41:42.500
Wait, how come you actually
do seem all right?

41:42.543 --> 41:44.110
Because it's not over.

41:44.153 --> 41:46.025
You don't always lasso the bull
on the first try.

41:46.068 --> 41:47.809
You got to keep swinging.

41:47.853 --> 41:49.507
I'm gonna fight
for him,

41:49.550 --> 41:52.074
because Rafael is my destiny.
