01:35.525 --> 01:39.151
When surface temperatures
in the Atlantic rise above 80 degrees,

01:39.152 --> 01:42.072
conditions are ideal for a hurricane.

01:42.093 --> 01:45.013
Westerly winds kick up condensation,

01:45.096 --> 01:49.225
forming cumulonimbus clouds which begin
to revolve around a central axis.

01:49.425 --> 01:53.129
On September seventh,
these exact conditions gave birth

01:53.173 --> 01:55.424
to Hurricane Faith, currently barreling

01:55.508 --> 01:58.887
toward the Eastern seaboard
of the United States.

01:58.970 --> 02:01.931
On November 7th, 1984,

02:02.015 --> 02:05.351
a different sort
of hurricane swirled into being.

02:05.435 --> 02:08.062
A 25-year-old Harvard Law graduate

02:08.110 --> 02:12.530
took South Carolina State
Senate District Fourteen by storm.

02:12.614 --> 02:15.784
His name was Francis J. Underwood.

02:15.868 --> 02:17.870
How strong will it be
when it hits?

02:17.953 --> 02:20.831
Simulators say Cat Three,
possibly Cat Four.

02:20.915 --> 02:23.251
Major devastation across a dozen states.

02:23.333 --> 02:26.503
Yes, but some of these projections
have it turning back to sea.

02:26.586 --> 02:29.422
That's highly unlikely, sir.

02:29.506 --> 02:31.758
Sir, FEMA's mission
is to prepare for the worst.

02:31.842 --> 02:35.303
First responders,
medical, mass evacuation.

02:35.386 --> 02:38.348
I'm worried about the funding.

02:38.431 --> 02:40.767
The Disaster Relief Fund
has been depleted by a third

02:40.851 --> 02:43.603
- since you launched AmWorks.
- That still leaves two billion.

02:43.687 --> 02:47.357
Well, for this storm,
we need four times that.

02:47.440 --> 02:50.152
I'm about to meet with the leadership
to ask them to replenish the fund,

02:50.236 --> 02:51.653
but I can't ask for that much.

02:51.736 --> 02:55.824
We need eight billion minimum
for bare-bones preparation.

02:55.907 --> 02:57.993
We shouldn't gamble
with something like this, sir.

02:58.076 --> 03:00.745
Hundreds could die. Maybe thousands.

03:01.955 --> 03:04.041
"The impossible made possible.

03:04.124 --> 03:09.129
The thing no one else dares to do,
that everyone says can't be done.

03:09.213 --> 03:14.009
Imagine a boy standing on the shores
of the Charleston Harbor.

03:14.092 --> 03:19.472
Two miles away, a faint line
on the horizon, is Fort Sumter.

03:19.556 --> 03:23.727
All the other boys say
it's impossible to swim there.

03:23.810 --> 03:26.980
But this one boy thinks it can be done.

03:27.064 --> 03:31.068
The others gasp as he kicks off
his shoes, plunges into the water.

03:31.151 --> 03:34.196
They watch with shock
as he grows farther from the shore.

03:35.864 --> 03:39.910
They whisper to each other solemnly,
'He'll drown. He'll never make it.'

03:39.993 --> 03:42.495
'No, he'll turn around
when it gets too hard.'"

03:42.579 --> 03:44.039
Mr. President.

03:44.122 --> 03:47.042
Have a seat. I'll have Jessica
bring in some refreshments.

03:47.125 --> 03:49.669
Henry Mitchell,
the new Senate Majority Leader.

03:49.753 --> 03:51.255
What happened to Hector Mendoza?

03:51.338 --> 03:54.549
Well, you don't declare a couple
of paid speeches as income and boom,

03:54.632 --> 03:57.393
you're no longer in Congress,
and certainly not running for president.

03:57.468 --> 04:00.847
You got rid of Ronnie.
Hector loved that painting.

04:00.931 --> 04:02.933
He's not gone, just in storage.

04:03.016 --> 04:04.310
Just like Hector.

04:04.392 --> 04:07.729
My father served under Eisenhower.
Drove his jeep in Normandy.

04:07.812 --> 04:10.065
Your father was at D-Day?

04:10.148 --> 04:12.901
Utah Beach. At Bastogne too.

04:12.984 --> 04:15.653
Isn't this just a little love fest.

04:15.737 --> 04:19.406
Gentlemen, the hurricane.
I need the DRF replenished.

04:20.658 --> 04:23.078
The Speaker's calling
for an emergency session tonight.

04:23.161 --> 04:25.289
We're prepared to allocate ten billion.

04:25.372 --> 04:27.207
I was only gonna ask for eight.

04:27.291 --> 04:30.210
You sign the bill,
you'll get the ten billion.

04:30.294 --> 04:34.172
But no FEMA money
or any other agency funds can be used

04:34.256 --> 04:36.925
for your jobs program again,
under any circumstances.

04:37.008 --> 04:38.635
Don't politicize this.

04:38.718 --> 04:41.388
America Works and the hurricane
are two separate issues.

04:41.471 --> 04:43.974
Excuse me, Mr. President,

04:44.057 --> 04:47.102
but you're the one that raided
the DRF for political purposes.

04:47.185 --> 04:48.561
We're correcting a wrong.

04:48.645 --> 04:51.106
And jeopardizing
the entire Eastern Seaboard.

04:51.189 --> 04:53.359
That's on the White House,
not on us.

04:53.441 --> 04:56.320
We're supplying the funds,
the money you took illegally.

04:56.403 --> 04:59.530
If you choose not to sign the bill,
we can't be blamed.

04:59.614 --> 05:00.657
We stepped up.

05:04.619 --> 05:08.123
I thought you might try
to make this about America Works.

05:08.206 --> 05:10.583
And look, I admit, I may have overstepped.

05:10.667 --> 05:12.294
But let me show you something.

05:12.378 --> 05:15.880
Every day, I ask the Comms office
to give me profiles

05:15.964 --> 05:19.968
of ten AmWorks beneficiaries.
These are success stories.

05:20.051 --> 05:24.390
This is just a fraction of the 40,000
people that we put back to work.

05:24.472 --> 05:27.475
With money that wasn't appropriated
for that purpose.

05:27.558 --> 05:29.978
You don't get
to break the piggy bank

05:30.061 --> 05:32.897
then ask us to glue it together
and put in more pennies.

05:32.981 --> 05:36.276
I've got over 50 Democrats
and Republicans in both houses

05:36.360 --> 05:39.988
that have publicly supported
America Works since its introduction.

05:40.071 --> 05:41.239
The tide is turning.

05:41.323 --> 05:43.491
Your own people
are getting behind the program.

05:43.574 --> 05:46.911
Then where are they now?
Why aren't we getting calls?

05:46.995 --> 05:50.207
Why do they all support
this emergency bill?

05:50.290 --> 05:52.667
If you pass it, I'll veto it,
but there's no reason

05:52.750 --> 05:54.752
we have to turn this
into a pissing match.

05:54.836 --> 05:57.297
You know that we have the votes
to override your veto.

05:57.381 --> 06:00.384
It passes in ten days
without a signature, regardless.

06:00.467 --> 06:05.347
The only question is whether you're
gonna sign it before that hurricane hits,

06:05.431 --> 06:08.766
or watch it become law
after thousands have died.

06:09.684 --> 06:11.686
Henry...

06:11.769 --> 06:16.691
I sat with Hector dozens of times
at this very table

06:16.774 --> 06:21.321
and we were always able to work out
our differences, to negotiate.

06:21.405 --> 06:23.907
This isn't Hector's office anymore.

06:23.990 --> 06:25.575
Or his table.

06:25.658 --> 06:29.079
Gentlemen, is there no room
for a compromise?

06:29.162 --> 06:31.081
- No.
- Bob?

06:31.164 --> 06:32.623
No, Mr. President.

06:34.625 --> 06:36.586
It's going wide in an hour.

06:36.669 --> 06:38.629
Seven governors,
all up and down the East Coast.

06:38.713 --> 06:40.590
They're demanding
that you sign the bill.

06:40.673 --> 06:42.717
- Who tipped you off?
- Jim Matthews' flack.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.928
Matthews is turning on us? What's it say?

06:45.011 --> 06:48.265
"President Underwood has undermined
the separation of powers

06:48.348 --> 06:51.768
and put the fate of the entire
East Coast in Hurricane Faith's hands.

06:51.851 --> 06:55.063
I am joining with the Governors
of North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland..."

06:55.146 --> 06:56.940
That's enough.
I don't need to hear any more.

06:57.023 --> 06:59.901
See how many governors you can get
on the phone in 30 minutes.

06:59.984 --> 07:02.112
- Yes, sir.
- I've got something else for you, sir.

07:02.195 --> 07:04.448
The AmWorks case studies.
These are your ten for the day.

07:04.531 --> 07:07.367
- I don't have time for that now.
- You should see this top file.

07:09.000 --> 07:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:17.877 --> 07:20.171
Freddy's working as a dishwasher.

07:20.255 --> 07:22.757
He was one of the first people to sign up.

07:29.097 --> 07:32.058
Should I prepare a statement
in response to the governors?

07:34.018 --> 07:36.062
Sir?

07:36.146 --> 07:38.231
No statement. No. Not yet.

07:38.315 --> 07:39.649
Yes, sir.

07:43.861 --> 07:46.114
- Yes, sir?
- Send a message to the entire cabinet.

07:46.197 --> 07:48.366
I want a meeting tomorrow morning,
first thing.

07:50.118 --> 07:51.786
"During his tenure as whip,

07:51.869 --> 07:56.542
Underwood was known for employing
intimidation, bravado and fear.

07:56.624 --> 08:01.171
His recent stance against Russia is
a continuation of strong-arm diplomacy,

08:01.254 --> 08:04.841
carried out by his wife,
whom he appointed UN ambassador

08:04.924 --> 08:07.677
despite the Senate voting her down.

08:07.760 --> 08:11.389
The use of FEMA funds
for America Works shocked many,

08:11.473 --> 08:15.935
but it's simply the most recent
in a career's worth of unilateral moves.

08:16.019 --> 08:21.107
Minority Leader Bob Birch said,
'The President consistently demonstrates

08:21.191 --> 08:25.362
an utter lack of partnership
coupled with reckless abandon.'"

08:25.445 --> 08:29.366
Sir, have you given any thought
to simply signing the bill

08:29.449 --> 08:31.493
that Congress passed last night?

08:38.957 --> 08:42.086
How many of you think
I should sign the bill?

08:42.169 --> 08:44.672
Well, surely, some of you think I should.

08:47.509 --> 08:51.095
You know, I think too often, the people
in this room are afraid of upsetting me.

08:51.179 --> 08:52.430
And that's my fault.

08:52.514 --> 08:56.518
I discourage dissent when it doesn't go
with the things that I want.

08:56.602 --> 09:01.231
So, I want you to be honest with me.
I won't hold it against you.

09:01.314 --> 09:03.858
How many of you think
I should sign the bill?

09:32.803 --> 09:34.305
Thank you.

09:34.389 --> 09:37.850
You have all worked very hard
to get AmWorks up and running.

09:37.934 --> 09:39.810
I don't want to sign its death warrant

09:39.894 --> 09:43.690
until we have exhausted
every resource available to us first.

09:43.773 --> 09:46.276
So I need every department
to draft a proposal

09:46.359 --> 09:49.529
of what they could do
in response to the hurricane.

09:49.613 --> 09:53.700
And if we still fall short,
I'll sign the bill.

09:53.783 --> 09:55.201
Is that okay with everyone?

09:55.285 --> 09:58.746
Let's aim for the day after tomorrow.
Thank you all very much.

09:59.747 --> 10:04.252
The starting salary for an employee
at Walmart is below the poverty line.

10:06.421 --> 10:08.965
Now, the American government
subsidizes Walmart

10:09.048 --> 10:12.927
to the tune of 7.8 billion dollars a year,

10:13.010 --> 10:18.057
by issuing food stamps
to over one in ten of its workers.

10:18.141 --> 10:19.934
But here's the scary part.

10:20.017 --> 10:24.230
Fifteen percent of all food stamps
are actually used at Walmart.

10:24.314 --> 10:29.777
Meaning Walmart gets to double dip
into the federal government's coffers.

10:29.860 --> 10:32.863
I'm as angry about it as you are.

10:32.947 --> 10:38.035
Because Walmart's top executives
have reaped almost 300 million

10:38.119 --> 10:42.624
in tax-deductible performance pay
over the last six years.

10:42.708 --> 10:45.126
That needs to stop!

10:47.878 --> 10:50.548
We need to raise the minimum wage!

10:55.470 --> 10:59.349
Cut down on corporate greed
by regulating bonuses.

11:01.809 --> 11:05.980
It's time to balance the scales.

11:12.654 --> 11:15.865
- Can we go through your call sheet?
- Just give me a second to decompress.

11:15.948 --> 11:18.242
We've only got a half hour
until the next event.

11:19.327 --> 11:21.871
- Doug called?
- While you were giving your speech.

11:21.954 --> 11:24.123
- What about?
- He wouldn't say.

11:52.193 --> 11:53.944
How'd it go in Cedar Rapids?

11:54.028 --> 11:56.989
Well. We got AFSCME on board.
Good turnout. What's up?

11:57.073 --> 11:59.492
Sharp has an event in Dubuque tomorrow.

11:59.576 --> 12:01.619
You're scheduled to be there too.

12:01.703 --> 12:03.621
- And?
- Meet with her.

12:03.705 --> 12:05.665
- Somewhere discreet.
- Why?

12:05.749 --> 12:08.251
If we assume that Underwood is running,
and we do,

12:08.334 --> 12:11.128
we should also assume
that Sharp is on his team.

12:11.212 --> 12:13.214
That doesn't answer the question.

12:13.297 --> 12:16.634
I'm sure that Cynthia will object.
Hello, Cynthia.

12:16.718 --> 12:19.262
- Hello, Doug.
- Object to what?

12:22.599 --> 12:25.476
You're going to talk to Sharp
about the hurricane.

12:25.560 --> 12:28.688
...that are perceived
as helping average citizens

12:28.772 --> 12:30.106
feel more empowered.

12:30.189 --> 12:32.859
Who are some
of the bill's key opponents

12:32.942 --> 12:35.403
and what are hearing
in their on floor messaging?

12:35.486 --> 12:38.615
Well, the White House
would be the most prominent opponent

12:38.698 --> 12:41.200
if they slap the veto threat
on this, saying it's...

12:41.284 --> 12:44.370
- Oh. Thank you, Cynthia.
- You usually work out at midnight?

12:44.454 --> 12:48.541
My workout is the only time of day
the press corps gives me some privacy.

12:50.126 --> 12:52.962
- How did your event go tonight?
- Fine.

12:54.255 --> 12:57.091
I called bingo for half an hour
at an old folks' home.

12:57.174 --> 13:00.136
Well, that's pretty good.
Something a little different.

13:00.219 --> 13:03.931
You gonna steal it the way you stole
my talking points on the FEMA bill?

13:04.014 --> 13:05.642
You made good points.

13:05.725 --> 13:08.728
I'm not above agreeing with the opposition
when they're right.

13:09.186 --> 13:10.438
Mm...

13:10.521 --> 13:14.860
But I'm surprised you've been so critical.
I thought you and Underwood were close.

13:14.942 --> 13:18.070
I'm not above disagreeing with an ally
when they're wrong.

13:20.364 --> 13:23.660
In the spirit of what's right, I want you
to know I'm suspending my campaign.

13:23.743 --> 13:25.703
When the storm makes landfall,

13:25.787 --> 13:29.248
I'm going to ask people
to donate to the Red Cross instead.

13:29.332 --> 13:32.042
And I'll be heading out east to volunteer.

13:32.126 --> 13:35.254
That doesn't sound like a suspension.
That sounds like opportunism.

13:35.338 --> 13:38.215
No. I'll ask the press to leave me be.

13:38.299 --> 13:42.052
I can't force them to,
but we won't offer any logistical support.

13:42.136 --> 13:45.139
You want me to suspend as well?

13:45.222 --> 13:47.183
We can announce together.

13:47.266 --> 13:49.226
That takes the politics out of this.

13:51.354 --> 13:54.106
The cynical side of me
thinks that it benefits you

13:54.190 --> 13:56.984
if I stop my fundraising
right when I'm hitting my stride.

13:57.067 --> 13:59.821
Well, I'm not appealing
to the cynical side.

14:03.533 --> 14:04.773
I'll leave you to your workout.

14:06.243 --> 14:08.037
You have kids now.

14:09.539 --> 14:12.458
- I have a husband. He has kids.
- You don't consider them your own?

14:12.542 --> 14:14.126
It's late, Heather.

14:14.210 --> 14:17.046
I bring it up because they ground me.

14:18.422 --> 14:23.260
I don't know if you've felt this way
since you got married, but...

14:23.344 --> 14:27.598
when I think about my kids
and this hurricane...

14:27.682 --> 14:30.936
What if we didn't have the money
and advantages we do?

14:31.018 --> 14:32.687
What if they were in harm's way?

14:32.770 --> 14:35.773
What if they needed help
and didn't have it?

14:37.400 --> 14:39.443
Puts everything into perspective for me.

14:39.527 --> 14:42.112
This... campaign seems meaningless.

14:42.196 --> 14:46.200
It pales in comparison
to their well-being.

14:48.285 --> 14:50.872
Have you felt that at all?

14:50.956 --> 14:52.832
Since you became a mother?

14:57.253 --> 14:59.965
"Consulting with state governments"
is way too dry.

15:00.047 --> 15:01.674
Put in "working closely."

15:01.758 --> 15:04.051
- Don't you think that's disingenuous?
- Why?

15:04.134 --> 15:06.596
These seven governors just
publicly condemned the president.

15:06.679 --> 15:07.764
"Working closely"?

15:07.847 --> 15:11.183
Well, I condemn you every day
but I still work closely with you.

15:12.351 --> 15:14.687
So, I need to take this phone call.

15:14.771 --> 15:17.648
Uh... punch it up, bring it back to me.

15:18.816 --> 15:21.402
- Doug?
- I have a message for the president.

15:21.485 --> 15:22.612
What is it?

15:22.695 --> 15:25.573
Tell him Jackie and Dunbar
met in Dubuque tonight.

15:25.656 --> 15:27.700
And tell him I'm the one who told you.

15:27.784 --> 15:29.452
What did they meet about?

15:29.535 --> 15:32.830
Suspending their campaigns
after the hurricane hits.

15:32.914 --> 15:35.625
- How do you know this?
- Just tell him.

15:35.708 --> 15:38.168
Are you working for Jackie,
under the radar?

15:38.252 --> 15:40.212
- No.
- Dunbar?

15:40.296 --> 15:42.799
I'm just looking out for the president.

15:42.882 --> 15:45.969
Give him the information
and tell him who it came from.

15:46.052 --> 15:47.678
I'll let you know if I learn more.

15:55.603 --> 15:58.606
"The water was cold
and the current was strong.

15:58.689 --> 16:01.484
With every stroke,
the boy had to fight off chills

16:01.567 --> 16:04.487
and battle the tide rushing in
from the sea.

16:04.570 --> 16:07.824
Anyone watching him,
as his schoolmates did from the shore,

16:07.907 --> 16:11.577
barely making out a tiny speck
moving slowly across the water,

16:11.661 --> 16:14.039
would've thought he stood no chance.

16:14.121 --> 16:17.416
But that thought never
entered the boy's mind.

16:17.500 --> 16:20.962
His muscles ached, his heart pounded,

16:21.046 --> 16:23.965
but the water would not defeat him."

16:25.008 --> 16:28.845
I want rec centers and town halls,
but the most important thing is schools.

16:28.928 --> 16:30.471
They're the key.

16:30.554 --> 16:33.766
Well, every school east of Ohio.

16:33.850 --> 16:37.812
You tell the governors that push back,
tell them we'll pay for the shutdown days

16:37.895 --> 16:39.939
and overtime with what's left in the DRF.

16:40.023 --> 16:43.651
No, we'll figure out how to get people
there through some other department.

16:43.734 --> 16:45.611
Just get me the schools!

16:47.030 --> 16:48.948
I keep telling them
to stop bringing those.

16:49.032 --> 16:50.324
I know. I got these myself.

16:50.407 --> 16:53.036
Oh, thank you. That's sweet.

16:53.119 --> 16:55.621
- Any progress?
- Some, but not enough.

16:57.498 --> 17:01.127
Did you mean it today,
when you raised your hand?

17:01.210 --> 17:02.294
No.

17:02.378 --> 17:05.756
But I knew if I did, the others
who wanted to would be less afraid.

17:06.883 --> 17:08.925
Is that it? The bill?

17:09.010 --> 17:12.680
Yes. They delivered it
just after the cabinet meeting.

17:14.181 --> 17:16.392
Maybe I should just sign the damn thing.

17:16.474 --> 17:19.811
The longer I wait,
the bigger target I become.

17:19.896 --> 17:21.689
Well, the cabinet's working hard.

17:21.771 --> 17:24.273
Stick to your guns
and give them some time.

17:24.358 --> 17:28.194
Well, it could turn. Or dissipate.

17:28.278 --> 17:31.448
Hurricane Humberto was
on the same trajectory as Faith.

17:31.532 --> 17:34.326
Everyone thought that was gonna
wipe out seven states,

17:34.410 --> 17:38.622
but in the end, it turned south
and never became more than a Cat One.

17:39.665 --> 17:43.711
- How good are the chances?
- Extremely poor.

17:43.794 --> 17:47.965
But... there's still some hope.

17:48.049 --> 17:50.093
Relax for a minute, Francis.

17:54.805 --> 17:57.142
We should cancel the UN ceremony tomorrow.

17:57.224 --> 17:59.393
- What?
- Maybe it sends the wrong message.

17:59.476 --> 18:02.772
No, it's a great victory for you. For us.

18:02.855 --> 18:05.315
But celebrating in the middle
of a crisis, I don't...

18:05.399 --> 18:07.944
Well, that's exactly
what we should be doing.

18:08.027 --> 18:09.987
You made this resolution happen.

18:10.071 --> 18:14.159
It's the one good notch we have on our
belt since we moved into the White House.

18:14.241 --> 18:18.287
I'll be damned if I'm gonna
let this hurricane rob us of that.

18:21.248 --> 18:23.960
"When Congress refused to support
a peacekeeping mission

18:24.043 --> 18:27.630
in the Jordan Valley, the president
deployed troops anyway,

18:27.713 --> 18:31.341
stating his authority
as Commander in Chief."

18:31.425 --> 18:34.220
"The ramparts of the fort
were still a mile away.

18:34.303 --> 18:36.680
But he had reached
the point of no return.

18:36.764 --> 18:40.643
Turning back was no longer an option."

18:40.726 --> 18:44.772
"With the world's eyes upon him,
he continues to ignore precedent,

18:44.855 --> 18:48.109
convention, and some would say the law."

18:48.943 --> 18:51.278
"Why did he
cross that invisible line?

18:51.361 --> 18:54.782
Why risk his life despite
the great odds stacked against him?"

18:56.742 --> 19:00.079
"Critics have been harsh.
And yet most have stopped short

19:00.163 --> 19:03.499
of naming Underwood what he truly is:
a tyrant."

19:04.917 --> 19:08.087
"What drove Napoleon
to keep marching toward Moscow?

19:08.171 --> 19:10.840
Or Hannibal to cross the Alps?"

19:10.923 --> 19:14.677
"The warning signs are there.
It's our responsibility to heed them."

19:14.760 --> 19:18.181
"What kept a young Frank Underwood
swimming onward?

19:18.264 --> 19:20.474
And what kept him from drowning?"

19:22.559 --> 19:24.020
How did Seth learn this?

19:24.103 --> 19:26.814
- Jackie's comms director.
- And this happened last night?

19:26.897 --> 19:29.234
- From what I can gather.
- So why am I just hearing about it now?

19:29.316 --> 19:31.986
- I didn't hear about it before.
- She was trying to keep it a secret.

19:32.069 --> 19:33.869
But you're supposed to be
keeping tabs on her.

19:33.904 --> 19:36.365
The fact that you didn't know,
and only found out from Seth...

19:36.448 --> 19:38.534
I'm not in Iowa, sir.
I'm here running your staff.

19:38.617 --> 19:39.493
Excuse me?

19:39.576 --> 19:41.578
Just because Jackie and I
have a personal history

19:41.662 --> 19:43.372
doesn't mean I know her every movement.

19:43.455 --> 19:45.582
We are not talking about
your ex-girlfriend.

19:45.666 --> 19:47.668
We're talking about my running mate.

19:47.751 --> 19:51.130
And if she can't be trusted, I can't force
her to reveal things she doesn't want to.

19:51.214 --> 19:53.716
You convinced me to make the deal with her
in the first place.

19:53.799 --> 19:55.759
We needed information. She had access.

19:55.843 --> 19:57.262
And now she's lying to us.

19:57.344 --> 19:59.930
Maybe you should speak with her
before we consider this a crisis.

20:00.014 --> 20:01.348
I don't like your tone, Remy.

20:01.431 --> 20:03.934
- You're blowing this out of proportion.
- Watch yourself.

20:04.018 --> 20:07.218
When I worked for you in Congress, you
always told me to be straight up with you.

20:07.230 --> 20:09.148
I wasn't the president then.

20:09.232 --> 20:11.817
So you just want me to apologize
and be a yes-man?

20:11.901 --> 20:14.862
I want you to treat this office
with respect.

20:14.945 --> 20:16.530
You owe your staff that same respect.

20:16.613 --> 20:19.116
I gave you a position in the White House
when no one would touch you.

20:19.200 --> 20:21.077
I don't owe you a damn thing.

20:21.160 --> 20:22.870
How long you gonna hang that over my head?

20:22.953 --> 20:26.582
- Oh, it's like you want me to fire you.
- You couldn't, and you know it.

20:28.209 --> 20:29.752
Not right now.

20:29.835 --> 20:31.921
Seth and I are the only
two soldiers you have.

20:34.798 --> 20:37.927
- Get Jackie on the phone.
- Yes, sir.

21:03.744 --> 21:05.871
Sir, Congresswoman Sharp calling for you.

21:05.955 --> 21:07.332
I'll take it in here.

21:13.712 --> 21:16.006
Sir, we'll gladly polish those for you.

21:16.090 --> 21:18.592
I'm happy to do it myself. Thank you.

21:18.675 --> 21:20.094
Yes, sir.

21:25.975 --> 21:28.518
- Congresswoman.
- I apologize if you hear chewing.

21:28.602 --> 21:31.480
This is the first chance I've gotten
to eat all day. Non-stop events.

21:31.563 --> 21:34.650
I'm surprised you have an appetite
after meeting with Dunbar.

21:38.528 --> 21:40.823
Her people asked. I said yes.

21:40.906 --> 21:43.659
I thought I'd see what she wanted
before bothering you with it.

21:43.742 --> 21:47.163
Suspending your campaigns?
I'm assuming that you told her no.

21:49.999 --> 21:51.208
I told her yes.

21:52.709 --> 21:56.463
You realize she's just preying upon
your good nature to stop your fundraising.

21:56.546 --> 21:59.549
Even if that were the case,
the politics work in my favor too.

21:59.633 --> 22:02.511
It's insensitive to campaign
during a catastrophe this big.

22:02.594 --> 22:03.762
It could backfire on me.

22:03.846 --> 22:06.265
We don't know that it's
going to be a catastrophe.

22:06.349 --> 22:10.560
Weathermen can be wrong, Mr. President,
but not every weatherman in the country.

22:10.644 --> 22:12.271
All right, even if that's true,

22:12.355 --> 22:15.899
you should attack her for using
the hurricane to score sympathy points.

22:17.776 --> 22:19.236
I've discussed it with my staff.

22:20.070 --> 22:23.573
This isn't just your campaign, Jackie,
this is our campaign.

22:26.327 --> 22:29.663
May I offer you some advice, sir?
Sign the bill.

22:29.746 --> 22:34.668
If you don't, and the storm hits,
you and I won't have a campaign.

22:34.751 --> 22:36.962
You should get back to your dinner.

23:11.621 --> 23:16.252
Hey, everyone. Let's put down the dishes
for a second. I need to talk to you.

23:16.335 --> 23:19.880
Here's the deal.
I hired you three under America Works.

23:19.963 --> 23:22.299
And as much as we can use the manpower,

23:22.383 --> 23:25.428
I can't afford it
if the program gets ended.

23:25.511 --> 23:29.306
I might be able to afford to keep
two of you if you split shifts,

23:29.390 --> 23:31.058
but I can't keep all three.

23:34.395 --> 23:37.773
"A storm has been forming
not for weeks, but for decades.

23:37.856 --> 23:40.359
Its name is not Faith, it's Francis.

23:40.443 --> 23:44.654
The entire nation is in his path,
and if we ignore the warning signs,

23:44.738 --> 23:48.075
- we have no one but ourselves to blame.
- "...no one but ourselves to blame."

23:49.201 --> 23:51.370
It's not an article.
It's an opinion piece.

23:51.454 --> 23:53.038
I know.

23:53.122 --> 23:55.332
The paper can't take
this editorial stance.

23:55.416 --> 23:57.960
- It's too speculative.
- I'm aware. Print it as a column.

23:58.043 --> 24:00.587
The moment I do that,
you cross over to the other side.

24:00.670 --> 24:02.047
We can't keep you on your beat.

24:02.131 --> 24:04.216
So replace me.

24:04.300 --> 24:06.135
I want a column. It's time.

24:06.218 --> 24:08.095
Kate, you're on track
to be managing editor.

24:08.178 --> 24:11.218
You toss that out the window the moment
you switch over to being a columnist.

24:11.265 --> 24:15.269
I don't want to be editing other people's
words. I want to be writing my own.

24:15.352 --> 24:17.813
And not just the news,
I want my ideas out there.

24:17.896 --> 24:20.316
You know the Telegraph
will let you do anything you want.

24:20.399 --> 24:22.318
But we need you reporting
on the president.

24:22.401 --> 24:24.903
- Nobody does it better.
- My bias is clear.

24:24.987 --> 24:27.781
You shouldn't keep me on
as a reporter anyway.

24:27.864 --> 24:31.368
I'll tell you what. We can make
this work as an analysis piece.

24:31.452 --> 24:34.704
You tone down the speculation,
stick to the facts and quotes...

24:34.788 --> 24:36.832
- Speculation is the entire point.
- Fine.

24:36.915 --> 24:40.545
Just... give me a little something
from the other side, to balance it out.

24:40.627 --> 24:42.307
You know they're not gonna
give me a quote.

24:42.379 --> 24:46.008
Even if it's a source just tangentially
associated with the administration.

24:46.091 --> 24:49.303
You do that, we can print this
and keep you as a reporter.

24:52.306 --> 24:54.099
I got an idea who I can talk to.

24:56.852 --> 25:01.106
"On another day, with warmer water,
with the current carrying him,

25:01.190 --> 25:02.525
he might have made it.

25:02.608 --> 25:06.111
But on this day, he would only make it
halfway before his arms gave out

25:06.195 --> 25:08.614
and the numbness overtook him,
before the coast guard

25:08.697 --> 25:11.576
pulled him out of the water
despite his protests.

25:11.658 --> 25:15.454
Was he reckless? Was he foolish?

25:15.538 --> 25:16.622
Possibly.

25:16.705 --> 25:19.542
One thing can't be denied, however.

25:19.625 --> 25:24.004
What others saw as impossible,
he refused to believe as such.

25:24.087 --> 25:27.841
The water proved him wrong.
He fell far short of the other shore.

25:27.924 --> 25:29.885
And yet he made the attempt.

25:29.968 --> 25:33.013
And that... is everything."

25:38.977 --> 25:40.770
That's just the prologue.

25:44.274 --> 25:47.486
You don't mention America Works once.

25:47.570 --> 25:49.530
On purpose.

25:51.031 --> 25:53.700
That is what the book
is supposed to be about, isn't it?

25:53.783 --> 25:55.578
You don't like it?

25:56.786 --> 25:59.998
I do like it.
I just wonder if I...

26:01.166 --> 26:05.712
Well, maybe I don't...
understand what you're trying to do.

26:08.840 --> 26:10.717
Nobody cares about an idea.

26:10.800 --> 26:14.012
They might care
about a man with an idea.

26:14.096 --> 26:16.973
I only care about the man.

26:18.559 --> 26:21.811
The whole book will be like this...
these vignettes.

26:21.895 --> 26:25.190
Like a collection of short stories.

26:25.274 --> 26:28.611
Do you mention AmWorks anywhere?

26:28.694 --> 26:30.028
Nope.

26:30.613 --> 26:32.573
Not once.

26:36.368 --> 26:38.036
Well...

26:39.204 --> 26:43.959
I did want the book to be different,
but I... It just seems that that might...

26:44.042 --> 26:47.713
I think it might be the best thing
I've written in years.

26:47.796 --> 26:50.757
It could also be utter and complete shit.

26:51.592 --> 26:54.219
But when I can't tell the difference,
it's usually a good sign.

26:56.305 --> 26:59.766
I just don't want to lose sight
of the bigger goal.

26:59.849 --> 27:01.935
I don't know any other way to write it.

27:03.019 --> 27:07.524
If you want something different,
now's the time to find somebody else.

27:07.608 --> 27:09.610
No, I want you to finish it.

27:11.069 --> 27:13.029
Even though I have...

27:13.989 --> 27:17.367
no idea if it will end up
being relevant if I end up...

27:18.619 --> 27:20.621
signing this bill.

27:20.705 --> 27:22.080
Are you going to?

27:23.832 --> 27:25.751
I don't know yet.

27:25.834 --> 27:31.298
If I do, of course, I'll pay you in full
if the book becomes unnecessary.

27:32.549 --> 27:34.719
I'm not doing this for the paycheck.

27:38.347 --> 27:39.640
What do you think?

27:40.932 --> 27:42.142
Should I sign it?

27:42.225 --> 27:44.269
Well, I have skin in the game.

27:44.353 --> 27:46.563
So the selfish part of me says no.

27:49.274 --> 27:50.567
But...

27:52.110 --> 27:53.278
honestly?

27:54.029 --> 27:56.156
No book is worth people
losing their lives.

27:56.239 --> 27:58.534
Yes, but it's not just about the book.

27:59.535 --> 28:01.411
It's about putting people back to work.

28:01.495 --> 28:03.664
People can't work if they're dead.

28:07.584 --> 28:10.796
Well, I'm gonna obviously
be very occupied

28:10.879 --> 28:13.632
by this hurricane
for the foreseeable future.

28:13.716 --> 28:15.133
Let me think on this for...

28:19.429 --> 28:21.682
You'd better not fuck him over.

28:21.766 --> 28:24.518
- Excuse me?
- With what you're writing.

28:24.601 --> 28:26.228
I don't intend to.

28:26.311 --> 28:28.564
- The part about being foolish?
- You eavesdropping?

28:28.647 --> 28:31.024
- He's not foolish.
- That wasn't my point.

28:31.107 --> 28:33.193
I wouldn't take a bullet
for a man who was.

28:35.654 --> 28:37.656
Let's go, your car's waiting.

28:40.116 --> 28:44.580
As of tomorrow, Congresswoman Sharp
and I are suspending our campaigns.

28:44.663 --> 28:47.874
We will be traveling to areas
affected by Hurricane Faith,

28:47.957 --> 28:51.127
along with our campaign staff,
in order to volunteer

28:51.211 --> 28:54.047
in whatever capacity is most helpful.

28:54.130 --> 28:56.425
We're also suspending any donations,

28:56.508 --> 28:59.177
and urge our supporters
to donate to the Red Cross

28:59.261 --> 29:01.638
and other hurricane relief agencies.

29:01.722 --> 29:05.975
In times of suffering,
it's important to suspend politics

29:06.059 --> 29:08.604
and do what's best for the country.

29:08.687 --> 29:10.815
We look forward to resuming our campaigns

29:10.897 --> 29:14.317
when the storm has cleared
and the people of the east coast are safe.

29:17.904 --> 29:19.364
Freddy?

29:22.409 --> 29:25.454
The President would
like to see you, Mr. Hayes.

29:25.537 --> 29:27.914
I still got two hours left on my shift.

29:27.997 --> 29:30.292
It's fine, Freddy. You can go.

29:31.084 --> 29:34.003
Do you mind if I bring my grandson?

29:34.087 --> 29:37.090
Daycare got shut down 'cause of the storm.

29:37.173 --> 29:39.175
Of course. We got a car waiting.

29:40.969 --> 29:42.345
Come on, DeShawn.

29:44.973 --> 29:47.183
We going to see the president.

29:51.688 --> 29:52.857
Freddy.

29:56.693 --> 29:58.863
- It's good to see you, Frank.
- Thank you for coming.

29:58.945 --> 30:02.741
And this must be DeShawn.
How are you, sir?

30:02.825 --> 30:06.202
Oh. That is a firm handshake you have.

30:06.286 --> 30:08.747
Well, you want to go over
and sit at the desk?

30:09.456 --> 30:10.749
Go ahead.

30:20.049 --> 30:22.427
Yeah, I do that too, sometimes.

30:24.137 --> 30:27.390
That desk might be yours one day.

30:27.474 --> 30:29.518
Would you like to be the president?

30:30.560 --> 30:31.561
Yeah.

30:31.645 --> 30:34.940
Well, to be president,
you have to get good grades in school.

30:35.023 --> 30:37.651
Now, I see you brought
some of your schoolwork with you.

30:37.734 --> 30:39.945
I have an office
just around the corner in here,

30:40.028 --> 30:42.113
maybe you'd like
to go do your work in there.

30:42.197 --> 30:46.451
Or we also have a PlayStation
if you'd rather play that.

30:46.535 --> 30:48.578
- What games you got?
- Oh, we have plenty of games.

30:48.662 --> 30:50.246
Meechum will show you.

30:59.172 --> 31:02.342
What can I get for you?
Coffee, a soda, a beer?

31:02.425 --> 31:04.678
- No, I'm good, thank you.
- Please sit down.

31:09.349 --> 31:12.394
- You signed up for America Works.
- I did.

31:12.477 --> 31:16.314
I've got 40,000 case studies
just like yours.

31:16.398 --> 31:20.903
And I also have a bill on my desk that's
gonna cut the funding for all 40,000.

31:20.986 --> 31:22.821
Yeah, I been following on the news.

31:22.905 --> 31:24.447
I'm gonna sign it.

31:24.531 --> 31:27.158
There's too many lives at stake
with this storm.

31:27.242 --> 31:28.953
Sounds like the right thing to do.

31:29.035 --> 31:33.415
Freddy, you deserve a job, and Congress
is forcing me to take it away.

31:33.498 --> 31:35.458
I've spoken to our head of operations,

31:35.542 --> 31:37.962
and if you want it,
there's a job for you here.

31:38.044 --> 31:40.881
- Now, it's not charity, but...
- What's the pay?

31:40.965 --> 31:42.758
Well, I don't know the exact figures,

31:42.841 --> 31:45.343
but I figure somewhere around
three grand a month.

31:45.427 --> 31:47.888
- I know that's not great, but I...
- Healthcare?

31:47.972 --> 31:49.932
Well, yes, of course. That's included.

31:50.015 --> 31:53.226
- For DeShawn, too?
- That's right. All dependents.

31:53.309 --> 31:55.812
- What's the job?
- The kitchen.

31:55.896 --> 31:57.814
Helping prep food for the chefs.

31:57.898 --> 32:01.276
Well, as long as it's, you know,
above 2,800 a month.

32:01.359 --> 32:04.780
That's what I need to make my rent and
make sure DeShawn has everything he needs.

32:04.863 --> 32:07.616
I'll put you in touch
with the head chef right away.

32:07.699 --> 32:11.036
I was wondering...
if you had anything else?

32:11.119 --> 32:14.122
- Besides the kitchen.
- Well, I just assumed that...

32:14.205 --> 32:16.499
I've been working in kitchens
my whole life.

32:16.583 --> 32:19.795
Just 'cause I owned a rib joint
don't mean I like working in 'em.

32:19.878 --> 32:22.589
Well, what would you rather do?

32:22.672 --> 32:24.549
You got groundskeepers out there.

32:24.633 --> 32:29.095
I noticed 'em choppin' branches when
we were driving in, for the hurricane.

32:30.014 --> 32:31.431
You'd prefer that?

32:31.514 --> 32:33.850
Always wanted to work outside.

32:33.934 --> 32:36.686
Well, I'm sure that something
can be arranged.

32:39.856 --> 32:41.316
I want to be president one day.

32:41.399 --> 32:44.569
- Well, that's never gonna happen.
- But he said I could be.

32:44.653 --> 32:47.405
Listen up, boy. He lied to you.

32:47.489 --> 32:50.325
The truth is,
you ain't never gonna be president.

32:50.408 --> 32:54.203
It's just like them basketball players
you got posters of.

32:54.287 --> 32:57.206
They say you can do anything,
be a superstar, too.

32:57.290 --> 33:00.627
But they were born to be seven feet tall
and if they wasn't,

33:00.710 --> 33:02.378
tell me what would they have?

33:02.462 --> 33:03.630
Nothing.

33:03.713 --> 33:06.758
Half of them can't even read a damn book.

33:06.842 --> 33:09.302
No, boy, this place ain't for you and me.

33:09.385 --> 33:13.890
It's good to have dreams,
just so long as they're not fantasies.

33:13.974 --> 33:16.768
You let anybody sell you that shit,
it's your own damn fault.

33:16.852 --> 33:19.063
- You hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you, Pop.

33:36.788 --> 33:38.915
I'll get it to the House right away.

33:38.999 --> 33:41.334
- Green light on the release?
- Yes.

33:49.217 --> 33:51.386
I don't remember giving you
my phone number.

33:51.469 --> 33:55.557
You didn't. Your publisher did.
He wants me to write a book.

33:55.640 --> 33:58.060
I'm surprised you never have.

33:58.143 --> 34:01.813
I'm sure any book you wrote
would do ten times what mine do.

34:01.897 --> 34:04.273
Not as much as Scorpio.

34:05.942 --> 34:07.903
As any I've written since.

34:07.986 --> 34:09.905
I read it in college.

34:09.987 --> 34:12.407
Did it change your life?

34:12.489 --> 34:14.242
That's what you hear
all day long, isn't it?

34:14.324 --> 34:17.411
If I still got recognized on the street,
which I don't.

34:17.495 --> 34:21.166
Mostly at book signings, which I don't
recommend if you write your book.

34:21.248 --> 34:23.168
I didn't ask you here
to discuss my book.

34:23.251 --> 34:25.293
- No?
- I want to discuss yours.

34:25.378 --> 34:26.462
Oh...

34:27.589 --> 34:29.882
I'm working on a piece,
and it won't go to print

34:29.966 --> 34:32.385
unless I get a comment
from the White House.

34:32.467 --> 34:33.929
I'm not a part of the White House.

34:34.012 --> 34:38.391
Doesn't even have to be a quote, just
something... that I can paraphrase, like,

34:38.474 --> 34:41.393
"According to someone
close to the administration..."

34:41.476 --> 34:44.063
- Doesn't have to be on the record.
- I'm not commenting on the book.

34:44.148 --> 34:46.482
Tom, you got access no one else has.

34:46.565 --> 34:50.445
For a reason. 'Cause he knows
I won't talk. Especially to you.

34:53.281 --> 34:55.199
Well, can I buy you a drink?

34:55.283 --> 34:56.784
Getting me drunk won't work.

34:56.868 --> 34:59.788
You came out to meet me here.
I owe you one.

35:01.081 --> 35:02.624
Why don't I buy you a drink?

35:04.417 --> 35:06.586
How about we have a few?

35:07.712 --> 35:09.589
A few.

35:09.672 --> 35:11.299
I can live with that.

35:17.639 --> 35:20.558
I'm so sorry, Francis.
I know how hard this is.

35:20.642 --> 35:23.561
It was out of my hands.
I can't control the weather.

35:24.270 --> 35:25.772
Still.

35:27.356 --> 35:30.944
What frustrates me more than anything
is we were starting to turn the ship.

35:31.027 --> 35:33.822
I was getting support in Congress.
A few more months...

35:33.905 --> 35:37.617
and the leadership would've had no choice
but to support America Works.

35:40.745 --> 35:42.956
Well, if it's any solace,
Cathy just called.

35:43.039 --> 35:45.834
The Russians are willing
to contribute troops.

35:45.917 --> 35:47.460
To the peacekeeping force?

35:47.543 --> 35:49.712
They don't want to be left out.

35:49.796 --> 35:51.464
No catch, no conditions?

35:51.547 --> 35:54.425
None. There's too much pressure
on them in the UN.

35:54.509 --> 35:56.469
So the isolation worked.

35:56.552 --> 35:59.014
They're sending 300 troops.

35:59.097 --> 36:00.974
That's incredible.

36:01.057 --> 36:05.145
- We did it.
- Oh, no, not we. It was all you.

36:05.229 --> 36:07.522
- Join me for dinner?
- I'm gonna turn in.

36:07.605 --> 36:08.606
This early, huh?

36:08.690 --> 36:11.400
I'm gonna be up three straight days
once this hurricane hits.

36:11.484 --> 36:13.319
I need to get all the sleep I can.

36:14.154 --> 36:16.489
That's a good idea.
I'll leave you be.

36:21.327 --> 36:24.164
Have one of the stewards wake me
when it hits the coast.

36:43.892 --> 36:45.560
Francis.

36:46.853 --> 36:48.688
Francis?

36:52.859 --> 36:54.944
Where did it make landfall?

36:55.028 --> 36:57.446
- It didn't.
- What?

36:57.530 --> 36:59.032
The hurricane turned.

37:02.785 --> 37:05.997
It's due east now.
It might hit Bermuda.

37:06.081 --> 37:09.959
But it'll, uh, dissipate quickly
now that it's reaching colder water.

37:10.043 --> 37:12.461
It looks like we dodged a bullet,
Mr. President.

37:12.545 --> 37:15.757
I barely got the money in time
for a halfway decent response.

37:25.100 --> 37:26.517
How do we pull back on the bill?

37:26.601 --> 37:28.641
Already delivered to Congress,
we put out a release.

37:28.686 --> 37:31.689
There must be some parliamentary procedure
that will nullify my signature.

37:31.773 --> 37:33.333
I checked with the White House counsel.

37:33.399 --> 37:36.569
The bill is officially law
and the money's already been appropriated.

37:42.326 --> 37:46.330
FEMA is assisting thousands
of evacuees returning to their homes.

37:46.371 --> 37:50.083
With the exception of moderate flooding in
Georgia due to rain from the outer bands,

37:50.166 --> 37:53.962
the rest of the Eastern Seaboard
was left virtually untouched

37:54.045 --> 37:57.465
by the hurricane everyone expected
to be the storm of the century.

37:57.548 --> 38:00.885
The biggest casualty to Faith
was not life or property, however,

38:00.969 --> 38:04.889
but rather President Underwood's
controversial America Works plan,

38:04.973 --> 38:07.683
which Congress defunded
in order to free up resources

38:07.767 --> 38:09.727
for storm-related disaster relief.

38:09.811 --> 38:13.315
The president himself signed
the emergency appropriation into law

38:13.398 --> 38:17.402
after facing immense pressure
from both parties and the media.

38:20.071 --> 38:21.697
So you're out of a job, I guess.

38:23.158 --> 38:26.577
Probably. Wouldn't be the first time.

38:27.703 --> 38:32.041
If it makes you feel any better, there's
no way my story'll get printed now.

38:32.125 --> 38:34.543
Why? Because I wouldn't give you a quote?

38:34.627 --> 38:38.340
- No, it was a whole hurricane metaphor.
- Hm...

38:38.423 --> 38:41.385
Kind of takes the wind out of the sails
if there's no hurricane.

38:42.427 --> 38:43.761
Well...

38:45.138 --> 38:47.765
at least you got laid.

38:47.849 --> 38:51.436
Yep. That... that's poetic.

38:51.519 --> 38:54.897
Yeah. I'm a writer.

38:54.981 --> 38:56.482
Yeah.

39:05.825 --> 39:09.037
- What is it?
- I gotta go.

39:09.120 --> 39:11.206
Is that your way of getting rid of me?

39:11.289 --> 39:13.708
No. It's the president.

39:21.132 --> 39:22.967
I'm gonna need the shirt back.

39:33.686 --> 39:35.980
If you asked me over to let me go,
it wasn't necessary.

39:36.064 --> 39:38.774
- But I appreciate the thoughtfulness.
- I'm not letting you go.

39:38.858 --> 39:40.609
This book is more important now than ever.

39:40.693 --> 39:43.029
But... America Works is done.

39:43.112 --> 39:45.865
Well, there's only one way
to get it back on track.

39:45.948 --> 39:48.368
I'm announcing my candidacy for 2016.

39:48.452 --> 39:50.203
- Wow.
- I couldn't run before.

39:50.286 --> 39:52.926
I didn't have the money and I didn't
have the leadership's backing.

39:52.955 --> 39:55.250
But now that I've proven
what AmWorks can do,

39:55.333 --> 39:57.752
the money and the support will be there.

39:57.835 --> 40:01.214
A vote for Frank Underwood
is a vote for America Works.

40:01.297 --> 40:03.758
- You were right.
- How was I right?

40:04.800 --> 40:07.136
Come over here,
take a look out the window.

40:11.891 --> 40:14.519
- You see that man working over there?
- Mm-hm.

40:14.602 --> 40:16.979
- That's Freddy Hayes.
- The ribs guy?

40:17.063 --> 40:20.983
- He's a groundskeeper now.
- That's generous of you.

40:21.067 --> 40:23.403
No, it wasn't. It's my job.

40:23.487 --> 40:27.073
You wrote that I refuse to see
the impossible as impossible.

40:27.156 --> 40:28.950
Freddy is one job.

40:29.033 --> 40:31.286
I have ten million more to go.

40:31.369 --> 40:34.414
That's my story
and that's why you were right.

40:34.498 --> 40:36.874
So you wanna get back to work?

40:36.958 --> 40:38.460
I'm in.

40:39.210 --> 40:42.255
Now? I don't have my notebook.

40:43.507 --> 40:45.174
