01:20.924 --> 01:22.025
They're late.

02:40.436 --> 02:41.501
Brenda,
we're coming up behind.

02:41.503 --> 02:42.835
Keep 'em busy.

02:42.837 --> 02:43.838
Hang on!

02:55.183 --> 02:56.452
Call it in!

02:57.520 --> 02:58.585
Transport zero-one-niner,

02:58.587 --> 02:59.954
we got trouble
on the rail line.

02:59.956 --> 03:02.789
<i>Mile 23, send backup!
Send backup!</i>

03:02.791 --> 03:04.760
<i>Roger that. On our way.</i>

03:19.374 --> 03:21.577
This is crazy, Thomas!

03:25.348 --> 03:26.550
Whoa!

03:31.051 --> 03:32.054
Hang on.

03:43.198 --> 03:44.733
Get me closer!

03:58.615 --> 03:59.815
Come on, Vince!

04:09.793 --> 04:10.794
Vince!

04:17.099 --> 04:18.168
Jump!

04:32.280 --> 04:33.649
Shit!

04:34.015 --> 04:35.150
Let's go!

04:35.883 --> 04:38.253
Hey! Berg!

04:43.959 --> 04:45.927
Zero-one-niner,
be advised.

04:45.929 --> 04:47.760
You've taken on boarders
at the rear.

04:47.762 --> 04:49.899
We're engaging the truck now.

04:52.401 --> 04:54.868
Hey, Brenda, you got company!

04:54.870 --> 04:56.002
Go, go, go!

04:56.004 --> 04:57.273
Open fire.

04:58.975 --> 04:59.975
Watch out!

05:01.978 --> 05:02.978
Holy shit!

05:11.018 --> 05:13.756
Thomas, you're on your own.
Don't die.

05:15.390 --> 05:16.592
Good luck!

05:17.691 --> 05:19.160
We gotta move. Come on!

05:40.848 --> 05:43.786
Go, go! You heard him!

05:50.093 --> 05:51.728
Give me the bag!

06:03.638 --> 06:04.939
Shoot!

06:07.075 --> 06:08.376
Get down! Get down!

06:09.109 --> 06:10.111
Vince?

06:12.679 --> 06:14.780
We're set! Cover your ass!

06:14.782 --> 06:16.150
Go, go, go!

06:17.419 --> 06:18.621
Take cover!

06:19.621 --> 06:20.923
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

06:34.969 --> 06:37.206
We lost the rear five.
Stop the train!

06:54.556 --> 06:56.622
Newt!

06:56.624 --> 06:58.426
All right, come on,
let's go. Come on!

07:05.267 --> 07:06.268
Minho!

07:08.803 --> 07:10.939
Minho, can you hear me?

07:18.179 --> 07:19.247
This one. This one!

07:25.020 --> 07:26.087
Oh, shit!

07:27.421 --> 07:28.791
It's gonna be close.

07:40.569 --> 07:42.036
Hello!

07:44.205 --> 07:45.807
Squirrelly bastard.

07:49.277 --> 07:51.046
We got 'em! We got 'em!

08:05.159 --> 08:08.429
<i>Step out of the vehicle
with your hands up.</i>

08:12.333 --> 08:13.401
Let's go, boys.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.147
Stop right there. Don't move.

08:28.449 --> 08:30.753
I said freeze, asshole!

08:31.687 --> 08:33.288
Whatever you say, <i>hermano.</i>

08:38.592 --> 08:39.828
Hold him back!

08:41.729 --> 08:43.431
Y'all don't wanna do that now.

08:44.733 --> 08:45.966
Hey, Fry.

08:45.968 --> 08:47.870
Good to see you guys.
Go on, back up.

08:48.835 --> 08:50.371
Uh-uh-uh!

08:53.474 --> 08:54.475
Hi.

09:04.952 --> 09:06.785
Newt, how you doing?

09:06.787 --> 09:08.157
Don't rush me.

09:14.763 --> 09:15.964
Shit!

09:20.869 --> 09:22.368
Newt, get up here.

09:22.370 --> 09:23.437
Almost there.

09:33.147 --> 09:34.579
Newt, go!

09:40.021 --> 09:41.957
- Where the hell are they?
- I don't know!

09:43.958 --> 09:45.594
Go! There's too many of them!

09:59.040 --> 10:00.876
All right, boys, we're here!

10:07.415 --> 10:08.483
Keep moving!

10:12.487 --> 10:14.289
- Come on!
- Lower!

10:21.229 --> 10:22.230
Cover me!

10:28.835 --> 10:29.968
Go, go!

10:29.970 --> 10:31.536
All right, we're clear!

10:31.538 --> 10:32.974
Okay, we're going up.

10:34.975 --> 10:37.211
Vince, get up here!

10:41.450 --> 10:42.484
Now, Vince!

10:59.700 --> 11:00.969
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

11:04.004 --> 11:06.008
We're going home, baby!

11:07.508 --> 11:08.875
Yeah!

11:08.877 --> 11:10.478
All right, guys!
Good job. Whoo!

11:14.047 --> 11:15.348
Yeah!

11:42.543 --> 11:43.876
Aris.

11:43.878 --> 11:46.044
Hey, you guys okay?

11:46.046 --> 11:47.248
Yeah, we're fine.

11:48.316 --> 11:49.317
Jesus.

11:52.487 --> 11:54.420
There you are. Oh, God!

11:54.422 --> 11:57.222
It's okay. You guys are safe.
All right? Just hang on.

11:57.224 --> 11:58.493
I need
the bolt cutters.

12:04.699 --> 12:05.830
Are you okay?

12:05.832 --> 12:07.401
I'm fine. How are you?

12:12.640 --> 12:13.741
He's not here.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.852
I'll take one.

12:25.854 --> 12:28.386
Come on down.
You're safe here.

12:28.388 --> 12:30.155
Need medical attention,
move to your left.

12:30.157 --> 12:31.424
I need first aid.

12:31.426 --> 12:33.125
Right this way, guys.
Come on down here.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.327
Come on in, guys!

12:34.329 --> 12:36.364
Okay, guys, over here!

12:37.098 --> 12:39.001
All right, listen up.

12:40.801 --> 12:42.537
I know you've all
been through hell.

12:43.904 --> 12:46.207
I wish I could say
our troubles are over.

12:47.441 --> 12:49.176
But we're not
through this yet.

12:51.713 --> 12:54.281
WICKED's still out there.
They're not giving up.

12:56.717 --> 12:59.449
'Cause you got
something they want.

12:59.451 --> 13:01.620
They took you
because you're immune

13:01.622 --> 13:05.322
to a plague that's wiping
out the human race.

13:05.324 --> 13:08.528
And they think you're worth
sacrificing to find a cure.

13:09.696 --> 13:11.132
Well, I don't.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.099
So in two days,

13:14.101 --> 13:16.836
when we get this tub
of rust seaworthy,

13:16.838 --> 13:18.570
we're getting
the hell outta here.

13:18.572 --> 13:19.439
We're gonna go to a place

13:19.441 --> 13:21.641
where WICKED
will never find you.

13:21.643 --> 13:23.943
A place you can start over.

13:23.945 --> 13:25.546
A place you can call home.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.613
- Are you with me?
- t

13:28.615 --> 13:29.714
Come on.

13:29.716 --> 13:31.351
Come on
up here. Let's get to work.

13:31.353 --> 13:32.818
Come on,
I need some volunteers.

13:32.820 --> 13:34.219
Let's go.

13:34.221 --> 13:36.088
Let's get to work.

13:36.090 --> 13:39.759
Let's get these crates
on the boat.

13:39.761 --> 13:42.562
We got two days
before we leave.

13:42.564 --> 13:44.832
All right.
Give me a hand up here.

13:51.939 --> 13:53.638
May I help you?

13:53.640 --> 13:55.573
It looks good.

13:55.575 --> 13:57.341
How you feeling?

13:57.343 --> 13:58.476
Awesome.

13:58.478 --> 13:59.476
I was just asking.

13:59.478 --> 14:01.178
I know, I know,
you're just asking.

14:01.180 --> 14:02.682
Everybody's just asking.

14:04.416 --> 14:05.884
Don't worry.
When I Crank out,

14:05.886 --> 14:08.154
you'll be the first
to know, okay?

14:13.261 --> 14:14.629
Here, drink this.

14:21.502 --> 14:23.472
Took you guys
long enough to rescue us.

14:24.404 --> 14:26.140
It's good to see
you, too, bud.

14:28.643 --> 14:30.543
So what happened?

14:30.545 --> 14:32.243
I fought back.

14:32.245 --> 14:33.781
Tried to, anyway.

14:34.548 --> 14:36.814
You're lucky
you found us at all.

14:36.816 --> 14:38.716
They had us
on the move a lot.

14:38.718 --> 14:41.419
It felt like something
big was happening.

14:41.421 --> 14:43.324
Any idea where
they were heading?

14:45.191 --> 14:47.226
All I know is

14:47.228 --> 14:49.130
they kept talking
about a city.

14:53.499 --> 14:55.933
I didn't think
there were any cities left.

14:55.935 --> 14:57.338
That's because
there aren't.

14:58.204 --> 14:59.873
Not still standing, anyway.

15:01.907 --> 15:04.342
Okay, wait. What about Minho?

15:04.344 --> 15:05.880
Why wasn't he on the train?

15:12.353 --> 15:14.256
I'm sorry, Thomas.

15:17.425 --> 15:18.593
He was.

15:23.497 --> 15:25.631
They got 40,
maybe 50 kids.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.231
We're still compiling
an official count,

15:27.233 --> 15:28.366
but the pilot
got a good look.

15:28.368 --> 15:29.701
He thinks it was them.

15:29.703 --> 15:31.202
Of course it was them.

15:31.204 --> 15:33.004
What about the Berg?

15:33.006 --> 15:34.205
We tracked it a few miles.

15:34.207 --> 15:35.505
But someone must have
known about the locator.

15:35.507 --> 15:36.875
They're totally off the grid.

15:36.877 --> 15:38.212
Move it, Immunes.

15:39.879 --> 15:40.947
<i>C22.</i>

15:43.751 --> 15:45.183
<i>B9.</i>

15:45.185 --> 15:46.351
We're searching the area,

15:46.353 --> 15:49.754
but they're probably
long gone by now.

15:49.756 --> 15:51.824
Oh, no, they're not
going anywhere.

15:55.462 --> 15:57.531
He didn't get
what he really wanted.

16:02.168 --> 16:03.638
There, that's it.

16:04.505 --> 16:05.873
It's a few hundred miles.

16:06.807 --> 16:07.872
Based on the railways,

16:07.874 --> 16:08.808
everything that Aris
told us,

16:08.810 --> 16:10.575
that's gotta be
where they're headed.

16:10.577 --> 16:13.044
That's where
they're taking Minho.

16:13.046 --> 16:15.213
We take everyone
who can fight.

16:15.215 --> 16:17.216
Follow the roads
where we can.

16:17.218 --> 16:19.484
We can make it back
within a week.

16:19.486 --> 16:20.554
A week?

16:21.420 --> 16:23.690
It took us six months
to get here.

16:24.523 --> 16:27.292
We got over
100 kids here now.

16:27.294 --> 16:29.126
We can't just hang out
here forever

16:29.128 --> 16:30.995
after what we
just pulled.

16:30.997 --> 16:32.429
You wanna wander off

16:32.431 --> 16:33.965
to some random point
on the map.

16:33.967 --> 16:35.232
You don't even know
what's there.

16:35.234 --> 16:36.769
I do.

16:37.805 --> 16:39.406
It's been a few years,

16:40.741 --> 16:41.909
but I've been there.

16:43.978 --> 16:45.346
The Last City.

16:46.246 --> 16:48.580
That's what WICKED called it.

16:48.582 --> 16:50.784
It was their whole
base of operations.

16:52.451 --> 16:55.285
If that city
is still standing,

16:55.287 --> 16:57.658
that's the last place
you wanna go, <i>hermano.</i>

16:59.292 --> 17:00.995
That's the lion's den.

17:02.162 --> 17:03.730
It's nothing we haven't
done before.

17:03.732 --> 17:05.298
Yeah, with months
of planning,

17:05.300 --> 17:08.332
and reliable information,
the element of surprise,

17:08.334 --> 17:09.534
none of which we have now.

17:09.536 --> 17:10.902
Vince, I've
thought this through.

17:10.904 --> 17:11.801
Would you just
hear me out?

17:11.804 --> 17:13.171
The last time we
went off half-cocked...

17:13.173 --> 17:14.806
I lost everything.

17:14.808 --> 17:15.974
You remember that?

17:21.146 --> 17:23.646
Look, I know
it's Minho. All right?

17:23.648 --> 17:25.517
But you can't ask me
to put those kids

17:25.519 --> 17:27.021
on the line for one man.

17:28.922 --> 17:30.658
I won't do it.

17:33.792 --> 17:35.960
<i>Searching the grid now.</i>

17:38.231 --> 17:39.830
<i>A is completed.</i>

17:39.832 --> 17:41.834
<i>Scanning B-sector now.</i>

17:43.502 --> 17:44.869
Shit. Hit the lights.

17:44.871 --> 17:46.005
Let's go, let's go!

18:04.156 --> 18:07.328
Jeez,
they're getting close.

18:10.731 --> 18:11.799
You're right.

18:12.866 --> 18:14.033
We can't stay here.

18:53.540 --> 18:55.642
Where do you think
you're going then?

18:59.044 --> 19:01.244
Newt...

19:01.246 --> 19:02.515
Don't be a twat about it.

19:03.783 --> 19:04.951
I'm already in.

19:05.985 --> 19:07.484
Come on.

19:07.486 --> 19:10.355
No. No, not this time.

19:10.357 --> 19:11.455
Look,

19:11.457 --> 19:12.656
even if we find Minho,

19:12.658 --> 19:14.960
there's no guarantee
we make it back from this.

19:14.962 --> 19:17.698
Well, you'll need all the help
you can get then, won't you?

19:24.570 --> 19:27.305
Well, we started this
together.

19:27.307 --> 19:29.910
May as well
end it that way, too.

19:32.378 --> 19:33.579
Okay.

19:35.080 --> 19:36.783
Let's go get him back.

20:20.260 --> 20:21.462
No.

21:22.121 --> 21:23.122
Hey!

21:31.762 --> 21:32.764
Hey!

21:33.632 --> 21:35.833
Hey! No, no, no.
Wait. Hey!

21:35.835 --> 21:38.872
Hey, wait, wait!
Hey, it's okay! Hey!

22:17.877 --> 22:19.308
<i>How's he doing?</i>

22:19.310 --> 22:21.047
<i>Breathing levels look strong.</i>

22:32.491 --> 22:33.992
Oh, shit!

23:28.046 --> 23:29.347
No! No!

23:56.743 --> 23:58.608
<i>It's not as effective
as the maze,</i>

23:58.610 --> 24:00.744
<i>but it seems to be working.</i>

24:00.746 --> 24:02.746
It's promising.

24:02.748 --> 24:05.451
But we'll need a larger sample
to work with.

24:06.784 --> 24:08.720
<i>All right.</i>

24:09.453 --> 24:10.822
<i>Carry on.</i>

24:31.344 --> 24:33.376
<i>No! No!</i>

25:40.479 --> 25:42.782
You want us to go in there?

25:48.853 --> 25:50.818
I don't wanna come across
as too negative,

25:50.820 --> 25:51.886
but if I was a Crank,

25:51.888 --> 25:54.224
that's exactly
where I would be.

25:55.992 --> 25:58.462
I don't think we have
much of a choice.

26:07.104 --> 26:09.207
All right. I get shotgun.

26:28.460 --> 26:29.995
Well, here we go.

26:34.232 --> 26:36.433
Yeah, just take it
nice and slow.

26:44.508 --> 26:46.577
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

26:57.020 --> 27:00.188
It's okay. It's just one,

27:00.190 --> 27:02.758
so take it slow,
go around him.

27:02.760 --> 27:04.527
We'll be fine.

27:04.529 --> 27:05.896
Take it slow.

27:06.830 --> 27:08.265
Take it slow.

27:15.940 --> 27:18.309
Please.

27:18.809 --> 27:19.942
Please.

27:24.449 --> 27:25.651
Help me.

27:26.551 --> 27:28.083
Please.

27:28.085 --> 27:30.251
Please! Let me in.

27:30.253 --> 27:32.854
- Okay. Fry, we gotta go.
- Please! Open the door.

27:32.856 --> 27:34.456
- You need to go right now!
- Why won't you open it?

27:34.458 --> 27:35.790
Just floor it, Fry!

27:35.792 --> 27:37.327
- Hold on!
- Floor it! Come on!

27:43.401 --> 27:44.402
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

27:48.739 --> 27:51.009
- Come on, Fry, shake him!
- I'm trying!

27:53.711 --> 27:55.145
Go.

28:00.517 --> 28:01.619
Hang on!

28:03.520 --> 28:04.521
Oh, God.

28:05.989 --> 28:07.491
Frypan, watch out!

28:19.537 --> 28:20.571
Everyone okay?

28:21.439 --> 28:22.606
My hand.

28:24.775 --> 28:26.010
My hand.

28:29.078 --> 28:30.447
Fry, cover your eyes.

28:33.183 --> 28:35.150
Oh, shit. You okay, man?

28:35.152 --> 28:37.255
- Yeah. You all right?
- Shit, my hand.

28:38.088 --> 28:40.223
Wait! Thomas!

28:43.461 --> 28:44.927
Thomas, the door!

28:44.929 --> 28:46.965
Can you get out?

28:51.735 --> 28:53.434
Oh, shit. All right.

28:53.436 --> 28:55.836
- Newt, you all right?
- Fry, go around.

28:55.838 --> 28:57.375
I'm trying to get out.

29:02.113 --> 29:03.545
Newt, you okay?

29:03.547 --> 29:05.213
Yeah, I think so.

29:05.215 --> 29:07.284
Fry, you good?

29:11.289 --> 29:12.921
Oh, shit.

29:12.923 --> 29:14.189
Frypan, I think
we gotta move.

29:14.191 --> 29:15.393
- Now!
- Wait a minute!

29:17.193 --> 29:18.559
- Right now!
- Fry, now!

29:18.561 --> 29:20.562
Come on, what are you doing?
We gotta move! Come on!

29:20.564 --> 29:23.065
- Come on!
- Hold on!

29:23.067 --> 29:24.633
- Frypan gotta go! Come on!
- Wait!

29:24.635 --> 29:25.670
Come on!

29:29.772 --> 29:31.539
- Nice shot, Fry.
- Thanks.

29:35.246 --> 29:36.678
Okay. We gotta go.

29:36.680 --> 29:38.483
Go, go!

29:39.583 --> 29:41.285
Fry, come on, let's go!

29:42.385 --> 29:44.489
- Fry, let's move, let's go!
- Go! Go! Go!

29:48.992 --> 29:50.427
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

29:53.562 --> 29:55.130
Watch out.

29:55.132 --> 29:56.998
- Fry, you got any left?
- Yeah!

29:57.000 --> 29:58.568
Okay. This way, this way!

30:00.003 --> 30:01.570
Okay, Fry.
Other way, other way!

30:04.373 --> 30:05.374
I'm out!

30:07.677 --> 30:08.745
Shit!

30:17.821 --> 30:19.122
Hey, get in!

30:23.794 --> 30:25.861
- Go, Jorge, go!
- Go!

30:25.863 --> 30:27.065
Hang on!

30:43.647 --> 30:45.380
I'm impressed!

30:45.382 --> 30:47.385
You guys almost lasted
a whole day.

30:49.686 --> 30:51.822
- You good?
- Yeah.

30:57.493 --> 31:00.262
I'm sorry. I didn't wanna
bring you guys into this.

31:02.798 --> 31:03.966
I think what
he's trying to say

31:03.968 --> 31:05.570
is thanks for saving us.

31:06.904 --> 31:08.604
You're welcome.

31:08.606 --> 31:10.439
Hey,
don't get your hopes up.

31:10.441 --> 31:11.506
That checkpoint back there,

31:11.508 --> 31:12.908
that was the city's
last defense.

31:12.910 --> 31:16.314
If that was overrun,
chances are the city is, too.

31:17.948 --> 31:19.213
Yeah, unless they figured out

31:19.215 --> 31:21.485
some other way
to keep the Cranks out.

31:45.709 --> 31:47.641
Funny...

31:47.643 --> 31:49.076
Spent three years
trapped behind walls,

31:49.078 --> 31:50.209
trying to break out,

31:50.211 --> 31:52.548
and now we wanna
break back in.

31:53.348 --> 31:55.749
Yeah. It's hilarious.

31:55.751 --> 31:57.151
Jorge, how do we get in?

31:57.153 --> 31:58.885
Don't look at me, <i>hermano.</i>

31:58.887 --> 32:00.788
Those walls are new.

32:00.790 --> 32:03.594
I guess that's WICKED's
answer for everything.

32:06.297 --> 32:08.732
Well, we ain't gonna
figure it out from up here.

32:09.834 --> 32:11.269
Let's go!

32:23.047 --> 32:25.183
You really think
he's in there?

32:27.183 --> 32:28.920
I guess we'll find out.

32:30.621 --> 32:33.224
You know she's
gonna be there, too.

33:02.586 --> 33:05.187
We just have to make sure
we have the resources.

33:05.189 --> 33:08.392
And I'll keep in touch.
Excuse me.

33:11.328 --> 33:12.863
Are you ready?

33:13.931 --> 33:14.997
It'll be fine.

33:14.999 --> 33:17.798
<i>People are beginning
to lose faith, Doctor.</i>

33:17.800 --> 33:20.302
When you sealed off the walls,
you assured us

33:20.304 --> 33:23.438
that it would only be
a temporary precaution.

33:23.440 --> 33:25.573
Why have you now
denied all entry?

33:25.575 --> 33:29.910
Because things are changing.
And not for the better.

33:29.912 --> 33:32.716
Infection rates were up 300%.

33:33.214 --> 33:34.582
Fortunately,

33:34.584 --> 33:37.387
we may be on the verge
of a breakthrough.

33:39.788 --> 33:42.488
This is Subject A7.

33:42.490 --> 33:46.427
He spent over three years
in the Maze Trials.

33:46.429 --> 33:49.796
The antibodies
produced in response

33:49.798 --> 33:52.667
have been the strongest
we've ever seen.

33:52.669 --> 33:56.004
We're extracting
a new serum as we speak.

33:56.006 --> 33:58.340
And with your support,

33:58.342 --> 34:00.544
we'd like to begin
human trials.

34:01.644 --> 34:05.213
Thank you, Doctor.
That is very impressive.

34:05.215 --> 34:06.983
But we have been
down this road before.

34:08.518 --> 34:11.786
Frankly, we are all beginning
to wonder if...

34:11.788 --> 34:15.023
If our resources couldn't be
better spent elsewhere.

34:15.025 --> 34:16.757
- Meaning?
- Safe zones.

34:16.759 --> 34:19.192
Protected areas
like the one we're in.

34:19.194 --> 34:21.895
We could save
as many people as possible.

34:21.897 --> 34:23.331
How many?

34:26.400 --> 34:27.770
A thousand?

34:28.804 --> 34:30.904
Two thousand?

34:30.906 --> 34:33.274
And that's assuming
your protected areas

34:33.275 --> 34:35.208
stay protected,

34:35.210 --> 34:36.879
which we know they won't.

34:38.547 --> 34:41.714
The infected already outnumber
the healthy three-to-one.

34:41.716 --> 34:46.353
All you'd be doing
is delaying the inevitable.

34:46.355 --> 34:48.725
Have any of you ever lost
someone to the virus?

34:51.728 --> 34:52.963
A niece.

34:53.963 --> 34:54.965
Anna.

34:57.168 --> 34:59.936
I'm sorry we weren't
able to help her.

35:01.570 --> 35:05.442
But imagine if we were able
to live with the virus.

35:07.110 --> 35:09.411
To survive it.

35:09.413 --> 35:11.611
Imagine being able
to tell Anna

35:11.613 --> 35:15.351
that you could give her the
chance to live a normal life.

35:16.352 --> 35:19.455
We've never been
this close to a cure.

35:20.788 --> 35:24.828
And we've sacrificed a lot
to get this far.

35:26.294 --> 35:27.563
Please,

35:28.897 --> 35:31.668
don't let those sacrifices
be for nothing.

35:45.113 --> 35:46.648
Nicely done.

35:46.650 --> 35:50.554
They can be a tough crowd.
You handled them perfectly.

35:53.489 --> 35:56.423
"Delaying the inevitable."

35:56.425 --> 35:59.563
Thomas used to say
the same about us.

36:01.296 --> 36:03.433
Do you still think about him?

36:05.500 --> 36:08.402
I can help you with that,
those memories.

36:08.404 --> 36:10.437
There's no reason
to keep holding on to them.

36:10.439 --> 36:12.105
It's a simple procedure.

36:12.107 --> 36:13.843
There is a reason.

36:17.145 --> 36:19.015
I want to remember.

36:20.482 --> 36:22.515
If we find a cure,

36:22.517 --> 36:25.421
that's the only way all this
was worth it.

36:30.526 --> 36:32.962
I hope you're right.

36:53.683 --> 36:55.315
This place has really
gone through hell.

36:55.317 --> 36:56.649
We just gotta stay together.

36:56.651 --> 36:58.018
<i>We are the voice</i>

36:58.020 --> 36:59.786
<i>of the voiceless!</i>

36:59.788 --> 37:02.589
<i>They hide
behind their walls,</i>

37:02.591 --> 37:05.591
<i>thinking they can keep
the cure for themselves,</i>

37:05.593 --> 37:10.431
<i>while they watch the rest
of us wither and rot!</i>

37:10.433 --> 37:12.431
<i>But there are more of us</i>

37:12.433 --> 37:13.901
<i>than there are of them.</i>

37:13.903 --> 37:15.368
<i>And I say,</i>

37:15.370 --> 37:17.236
<i>we rise up</i>

37:17.238 --> 37:20.406
<i>and take back what is ours!</i>

37:20.408 --> 37:23.546
<i>Let's bring back a victory!</i>

37:39.829 --> 37:41.130
Get Janson.

37:55.912 --> 37:56.843
Let us in!

37:56.845 --> 37:59.913
That's it. That's our way in.

37:59.915 --> 38:01.480
Let us in!

38:01.482 --> 38:02.850
To the wall!

38:02.852 --> 38:08.258
Let us in!
Let us in! Let us in!

38:08.924 --> 38:10.024
Thomas!

38:10.026 --> 38:11.891
This is not
what you're looking for.

38:11.893 --> 38:13.627
All these people
trying to find their way in,

38:13.629 --> 38:15.596
you think you're gonna
find something they can't?

38:15.598 --> 38:17.933
Came this far.
I'm not turning back now.

38:21.636 --> 38:23.972
What the hell
did we get ourselves into?

38:32.814 --> 38:35.651
Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!

38:37.953 --> 38:40.756
Thomas, this
doesn't feel right.

38:41.723 --> 38:43.223
You were right, sir.

38:43.225 --> 38:46.296
The drone sweep picked him up
outside the walls.

38:48.330 --> 38:50.266
Get the guns online.

39:21.029 --> 39:23.665
Hey, guys, we gotta go now.
Look.

39:49.758 --> 39:50.890
Let's go, let's go!

39:50.892 --> 39:52.593
- Thomas, let's go.
- We gotta get out of here!

39:52.595 --> 39:54.160
Let's go! Let's go!

39:54.162 --> 39:56.965
Go! Go! Go! Come on!

39:57.732 --> 39:59.401
Go! Keep going!

40:00.468 --> 40:01.671
Come on!

40:04.207 --> 40:05.642
Move!

40:15.250 --> 40:18.517
Come on! Get in! Get in!

40:18.519 --> 40:20.155
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

40:22.923 --> 40:24.023
Come on!

40:24.025 --> 40:25.793
- No way out!
- Come on!

40:26.394 --> 40:27.492
Newt! Newt!

40:27.494 --> 40:28.698
Get your hands
off of me!

40:32.000 --> 40:33.600
No! Brenda!

40:33.602 --> 40:35.203
Brenda! Brenda!

40:39.140 --> 40:40.140
Go, go, go!

40:40.142 --> 40:41.843
Get off me!
Get off me!

40:50.384 --> 40:52.620
Send out a patrol.

40:52.622 --> 40:55.258
Tell them not to come back
until he's found.

41:13.641 --> 41:14.975
Let's go!

41:29.658 --> 41:31.160
Get out!

41:42.337 --> 41:43.339
Where you going?

41:45.006 --> 41:46.306
Where is she,
you son of a bitch?

41:46.308 --> 41:47.373
Hey! Hey! Hey!

41:47.375 --> 41:49.042
Shit! Hey! Wait!

41:49.044 --> 41:50.277
Come on,
come on, come on.

41:50.279 --> 41:51.410
I'm right here.
I'm right here!

41:51.412 --> 41:53.214
- Okay, okay, okay.
- All right. Okay.

41:53.216 --> 41:54.547
I'm right here.
I'm right here!

41:54.549 --> 41:55.681
Oh, Brenda.

41:55.683 --> 41:56.750
Everybody relax.

41:56.752 --> 41:58.518
We're all on
the same side here.

41:58.520 --> 42:01.389
What do you mean same side?
Who the hell are you?

42:12.833 --> 42:14.368
Hey, Greenie.

42:18.539 --> 42:19.874
Gally?

42:22.778 --> 42:24.247
No way.

42:29.584 --> 42:30.716
No, wait!

42:30.718 --> 42:32.451
Hold!

42:32.453 --> 42:33.786
Stop! It's all right!

42:33.788 --> 42:35.857
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Stop! Stop it!

42:36.357 --> 42:37.556
Stop.

42:38.794 --> 42:41.094
- He killed Chuck.
- Yeah, I know.

42:41.096 --> 42:43.062
I remember.
I was there too, all right?

42:43.064 --> 42:45.332
But I also remember
that he was stung

42:45.334 --> 42:47.136
and half out of his mind.

42:49.770 --> 42:52.438
Just calm down. All right?

42:52.440 --> 42:53.508
Come on.

43:03.985 --> 43:06.086
Kind of had that coming.

43:07.854 --> 43:10.822
Anybody else? Fry? Newt?

43:10.824 --> 43:12.193
Do you know this guy?

43:13.528 --> 43:15.330
He was an old friend.

43:16.798 --> 43:18.565
How?

43:18.567 --> 43:20.268
How is this possible?

43:21.002 --> 43:22.868
We watched you die.

43:22.870 --> 43:25.772
No, you left me to die.

43:25.774 --> 43:27.741
And if we hadn't found you
when we did,

43:27.743 --> 43:29.011
you'd be dead right now.

43:32.680 --> 43:34.216
What the hell
are you doing here?

43:35.716 --> 43:37.417
Minho.

43:37.419 --> 43:39.719
WICKED has him here.

43:39.721 --> 43:42.058
We're looking for a way in.

43:44.825 --> 43:46.461
I can help with that.

43:49.329 --> 43:50.930
Follow me.

43:50.932 --> 43:53.134
I'm not going
anywhere with you.

43:54.769 --> 43:56.171
Suit yourself.

43:57.137 --> 43:59.473
But I can get you
through those walls.

44:07.347 --> 44:09.581
After the maze,
I got picked up by a group

44:09.583 --> 44:11.349
headed to the city.

44:11.351 --> 44:14.221
They realized I was immune,
patched me up,

44:14.223 --> 44:16.592
and they brought me here
to Lawrence.

44:17.792 --> 44:19.259
This group's been at war
with WICKED

44:19.261 --> 44:21.895
ever since they took control
of the city.

44:21.897 --> 44:25.464
But WICKED can't hide behind
those walls forever.

44:25.466 --> 44:27.033
Day's gonna come,
and they're gonna pay

44:27.035 --> 44:28.671
for what they've done.

44:33.841 --> 44:35.044
Listen, uh,

44:35.876 --> 44:37.909
he doesn't get
a lot of visitors.

44:37.911 --> 44:41.115
So, let me do the talking.
All right?

44:41.983 --> 44:44.019
And try not to stare.

44:47.856 --> 44:50.122
Rose took my nose,
I suppose.

44:50.124 --> 44:52.224
Rose took my nose, I suppose.

44:52.226 --> 44:55.030
Suppose, suppose,
took my nose...

44:55.597 --> 44:56.998
I suppose.

45:01.235 --> 45:02.336
Gally,

45:03.170 --> 45:04.936
glad to see you made it back.

45:04.938 --> 45:07.007
Jasper told me what happened.

45:07.740 --> 45:09.242
It was a slaughter.

45:09.244 --> 45:11.513
There's nothing we could do
against those guns.

45:12.480 --> 45:14.248
No,

45:14.250 --> 45:17.183
but they can only poke
the hornet's nest so long

45:17.185 --> 45:19.051
before they get stung.

45:21.624 --> 45:23.756
Now, who are these people?

45:23.758 --> 45:25.625
Why are they here?

45:25.627 --> 45:27.994
We need to get into WICKED.

45:27.996 --> 45:30.432
Gally said you can get us
through the walls.

45:34.934 --> 45:36.802
Gally should know better
than to make promises

45:36.804 --> 45:38.405
that he can't keep.

45:42.577 --> 45:46.314
Besides, that wall
is only half your problem.

45:47.347 --> 45:50.249
Getting inside WICKED
is impossible.

45:50.251 --> 45:52.320
There might be a way now.

45:53.320 --> 45:55.990
But it doesn't work
without Thomas.

45:58.927 --> 46:00.729
Is that so?

46:03.630 --> 46:05.432
Do you know what I am...

46:06.834 --> 46:08.169
Thomas?

46:13.174 --> 46:15.477
I am a businessman.

46:18.079 --> 46:23.517
Which means that I don't
take unnecessary risks.

46:24.184 --> 46:26.286
Why should I trust you?

46:27.755 --> 46:30.289
'Cause I can help you.

46:30.291 --> 46:33.061
You see, if you can get me
through those walls...

46:33.927 --> 46:35.796
I can get you what you need.

46:37.365 --> 46:40.635
What is it
that you think I need?

46:41.335 --> 46:42.403
Time.

46:44.739 --> 46:46.273
Every last drop.

46:51.378 --> 46:53.380
Is that what I need?

46:56.083 --> 46:58.485
WICKED has something
we both want.

47:01.956 --> 47:03.526
I'll tell you what.

47:04.627 --> 47:06.893
Two can go for now.

47:06.895 --> 47:09.365
The rest stay down here
with me.

47:11.999 --> 47:13.631
Just a little insurance
to make sure

47:13.633 --> 47:15.670
you find your way back.

47:20.974 --> 47:22.677
We have a deal?

47:32.286 --> 47:34.556
Gally, show him the way.

47:45.999 --> 47:47.601
Be careful, Thomas.

47:50.369 --> 47:53.838
Gally, take care of these two.

47:53.840 --> 47:55.142
Yeah.

48:13.226 --> 48:14.726
This is gross.

48:14.728 --> 48:15.796
Jesus.

48:17.965 --> 48:19.500
Yeah, this is great.

48:29.510 --> 48:31.813
Stay with me.
We got a ways to go.

48:44.690 --> 48:46.393
We're ready.

49:01.542 --> 49:02.709
Shai?

49:06.547 --> 49:08.112
Hi, Miss Teresa.

49:08.114 --> 49:09.348
Hi.

49:11.518 --> 49:12.519
Hey.

49:14.886 --> 49:16.390
How are you feeling?

49:17.556 --> 49:18.625
Okay.

49:21.828 --> 49:23.830
Is that gonna make me better?

49:25.598 --> 49:26.899
I hope so.

49:28.600 --> 49:31.368
Do you remember the story
you were telling me?

49:31.370 --> 49:33.573
About the house
you grew up in?

49:34.274 --> 49:37.007
I don't remember.

49:37.009 --> 49:38.712
The one by the lake?

49:42.982 --> 49:44.180
It burns.

49:44.182 --> 49:45.717
I know, I know.

49:48.720 --> 49:51.224
There we go. All done.

49:52.993 --> 49:54.761
You're so brave.

50:26.993 --> 50:28.694
Oh,
that is incredible.

50:30.230 --> 50:32.799
How soon can you administer
to the infected?

50:35.035 --> 50:36.300
You show a lot of compassion

50:36.302 --> 50:38.901
for someone who just
opened fire on a crowd.

50:38.903 --> 50:42.307
You told me to do my job.
I had a shot. I took it.

50:43.575 --> 50:47.276
And missed, apparently.

50:47.278 --> 50:49.482
The patrols
never found a body.

50:50.884 --> 50:52.719
Thomas is still out there.

50:54.788 --> 50:56.788
What about her?

50:56.790 --> 50:58.025
Does she know?

51:00.792 --> 51:01.794
No.

51:03.363 --> 51:04.698
She can't.

51:06.065 --> 51:08.900
I need her to stay focused.

51:08.902 --> 51:12.502
Elevate security levels
throughout the city.

51:12.504 --> 51:15.541
I'm counting on you
to handle this, Janson.

51:26.352 --> 51:27.517
<i>Red zone,</i>

51:27.519 --> 51:29.285
<i>departing the station
in five minutes.</i>

51:29.287 --> 51:30.589
<i>Thank you.</i>

52:04.890 --> 52:06.924
This is a long way
from the Glade.

52:06.926 --> 52:09.759
<i>Fifteen
minutes to mandatory curfew.</i>

52:09.761 --> 52:12.663
<i>Please proceed home
in an orderly fashion.</i>

52:12.665 --> 52:15.699
<i>Remember,
this is for your safety.</i>

52:15.701 --> 52:16.768
<i>Thank you for your compliance.</i>

52:16.770 --> 52:18.267
Yeah, we better
get off these streets.

52:18.269 --> 52:21.974
And I know it's hard, but act
like you've seen it before.

52:46.198 --> 52:49.667
They've definitely
upped security.

52:49.669 --> 52:53.371
I'm guessing you shanks have
something to do with that.

52:53.373 --> 52:55.108
All right,
let's get outta here.

53:03.515 --> 53:05.551
All right, Newt, you're up.

53:11.490 --> 53:12.925
I got it.

53:45.257 --> 53:46.625
There it is.

53:47.694 --> 53:49.426
If WICKED's got Minho,

53:49.428 --> 53:51.163
that's where
they'll be keeping him.

53:57.803 --> 54:00.674
Lawrence has been trying
to find a way in for years.

54:02.374 --> 54:04.477
Place is crawling
with soldiers.

54:05.376 --> 54:07.045
They got
surveillance everywhere.

54:09.247 --> 54:11.150
Scanners on every floor.

54:13.517 --> 54:15.651
Sounds like a bloody fortress.

54:15.653 --> 54:17.922
Yeah, I thought you said
you had a way in.

54:20.425 --> 54:22.057
I might.

54:22.059 --> 54:23.325
You might?

54:23.327 --> 54:25.530
What the hell
do you mean "might"?

54:30.202 --> 54:31.637
Take a look.

54:48.453 --> 54:50.788
I said I had a way in.

54:50.790 --> 54:53.225
I didn't say
you were gonna like it.

55:00.633 --> 55:02.932
No. There's gotta be
another way.

55:02.934 --> 55:04.566
Like what?
You've seen the building.

55:04.568 --> 55:06.135
She is our only way in.

55:06.137 --> 55:07.771
You really think
she's gonna help us?

55:07.773 --> 55:09.706
I don't plan on
asking for her permission.

55:09.708 --> 55:11.041
Am I missing something here?

55:11.043 --> 55:13.910
This is the same girl
who betrayed us, correct?

55:13.912 --> 55:15.111
Same dick?

55:15.113 --> 55:16.615
I like her.

55:17.548 --> 55:19.552
What's going on?

55:22.421 --> 55:23.620
What, are you afraid
your little girlfriend's

55:23.622 --> 55:25.090
gonna get hurt?

55:26.425 --> 55:27.890
Hmm?

55:27.892 --> 55:29.258
Because this has
obviously never been

55:29.260 --> 55:30.425
just about rescuing Minho.

55:30.427 --> 55:31.895
Has it?

55:31.897 --> 55:33.996
Wait, what are you
talking about?

55:33.998 --> 55:35.433
Teresa.

55:35.435 --> 55:36.634
She's the only reason

55:36.636 --> 55:37.835
that Minho's even missing
in the first place.

55:37.837 --> 55:39.670
Now we finally have an
opportunity to get him back.

55:39.672 --> 55:42.138
And what? You don't want to
because of her?

55:42.140 --> 55:43.072
Because deep down inside

55:43.074 --> 55:44.341
you still care about her,
don't you?

55:44.343 --> 55:45.642
Just admit it.

55:45.644 --> 55:47.346
- Newt, I...
- Don't lie to me!

55:48.247 --> 55:50.583
Don't lie to me!

55:58.256 --> 55:59.925
Sorry.

56:03.561 --> 56:04.996
I'm sorry.

56:31.723 --> 56:34.361
Sorry about that. Back there.

56:38.630 --> 56:41.233
I guess I can't
hide this anymore.

56:52.910 --> 56:54.813
Why didn't you tell me?

56:55.747 --> 56:57.950
Didn't think it would
make any difference.

57:02.554 --> 57:04.220
All I know is that WICKED
must have put me

57:04.222 --> 57:05.924
in that maze for a reason.

57:07.325 --> 57:08.191
Maybe it was literally

57:08.193 --> 57:09.626
just so they could tell
the difference

57:09.628 --> 57:12.798
between immunes like you
and people like me.

57:15.700 --> 57:17.903
You know we can
still fix this, Newt.

57:19.438 --> 57:21.137
Okay? We can.

57:21.139 --> 57:22.771
Don't worry about me.

57:22.773 --> 57:24.276
This is about Minho.

57:25.245 --> 57:26.945
Now he needs us.

57:28.079 --> 57:31.513
So if there is even
the slightest chance

57:31.515 --> 57:33.182
that we can save him,

57:33.184 --> 57:36.188
we can get him out of there,
then we have to take that.

57:38.622 --> 57:40.793
No matter what the cost.

57:43.260 --> 57:44.829
Okay. I hear you.

58:09.387 --> 58:11.090
Let's get him up.

58:24.068 --> 58:25.137
<i>Minho.</i>

58:27.805 --> 58:29.340
Can you hear me?

58:34.412 --> 58:36.280
There's a little girl here.

58:36.948 --> 58:39.682
Her name is Shai Lun.

58:39.684 --> 58:42.187
She's been infected
for three weeks now.

58:43.488 --> 58:44.857
But, Minho,

58:45.657 --> 58:47.526
you're going to save her.

58:48.559 --> 58:51.295
And you can save
so many others.

58:53.398 --> 58:55.300
Everything we're doing here,

58:56.434 --> 58:58.035
it's working.

59:00.305 --> 59:01.907
Do you understand?

59:03.575 --> 59:06.512
That's why
this is so important.

59:31.068 --> 59:33.371
I just wanted you to know.

59:37.342 --> 59:38.510
Teresa.

59:46.718 --> 59:47.986
Minho?

59:55.459 --> 59:56.528
Minho?

59:58.496 --> 59:59.597
You're a traitor!

01:00:01.699 --> 01:00:03.034
We trusted you!

01:00:05.368 --> 01:00:07.802
- Get off!
- Hey, let her go!

01:00:07.804 --> 01:00:10.007
Get off me! Get off me!

01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:13.675
I'll kill you! You traitor!

01:00:13.677 --> 01:00:16.245
You killed them all!

01:00:26.858 --> 01:00:29.024
Teresa, they need you
in the med lab.

01:00:29.026 --> 01:00:30.561
It sounds serious.

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:40.405
I'm sorry, Teresa.

01:00:47.945 --> 01:00:50.148
It's not your fault.

01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:54.318
You did everything you could.

01:02:23.508 --> 01:02:26.508
<i>This is an alert.
Curfew is now in effect.</i>

01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:28.110
<i>Anyone caught
in violation of curfew</i>

01:02:28.112 --> 01:02:29.477
<i>will be subject
to immediate deportation.</i>

01:02:29.479 --> 01:02:30.581
Thomas?

01:02:54.703 --> 01:02:55.772
Thomas.

01:02:58.007 --> 01:02:59.409
Hey, Teresa.

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:03.146
You shouldn't be here.

01:03:03.148 --> 01:03:04.713
If Janson finds out
you're here...

01:03:04.715 --> 01:03:06.351
I'm not staying.

01:03:08.919 --> 01:03:10.155
It's just, uh...

01:03:11.856 --> 01:03:13.525
I had to see you.

01:03:15.894 --> 01:03:18.096
I have to ask you something.

01:03:21.164 --> 01:03:23.067
Do you regret it?

01:03:24.503 --> 01:03:26.204
What you did to us?

01:03:30.373 --> 01:03:31.641
Sometimes.

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:37.047
But I did
what I thought was right.

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:42.252
I'd do it again.

01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:47.792
Good.

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:23.359
Taking
the edge off, I see.

01:04:24.895 --> 01:04:26.630
Beautiful, isn't it?

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.134
Yes.

01:04:32.736 --> 01:04:34.737
- It's a lovely city.
- Hmm.

01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:37.608
The walls.

01:04:40.277 --> 01:04:42.277
It's amazing what people
can accomplish

01:04:42.279 --> 01:04:45.012
when their survival's
at stake.

01:04:45.014 --> 01:04:48.618
Squeeze them hard enough,
there's nothing they can't do.

01:04:50.853 --> 01:04:53.389
No line they won't cross.

01:04:54.491 --> 01:04:57.059
You've had a bit of a setback.

01:04:57.061 --> 01:04:59.164
It's nothing
we're not used to.

01:04:59.965 --> 01:05:01.633
Not this time.

01:05:04.001 --> 01:05:06.334
The virus is airborne.

01:05:06.336 --> 01:05:08.239
It's inside the walls.

01:05:09.272 --> 01:05:12.708
That serum
was our last chance.

01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:16.413
Anyone not already infected
will be inside of a month.

01:05:21.518 --> 01:05:23.183
Okay.

01:05:23.185 --> 01:05:25.353
We can handle this.

01:05:25.355 --> 01:05:27.154
We just need to evacuate
essential personnel,

01:05:27.156 --> 01:05:28.790
set up at another safe zone
farther north.

01:05:28.792 --> 01:05:31.560
We've still got 28 immunes
right inside this building.

01:05:31.562 --> 01:05:32.696
We can find more.

01:05:33.529 --> 01:05:34.764
You would.

01:05:35.699 --> 01:05:37.465
You'd hunt every last
one of them down

01:05:37.467 --> 01:05:39.670
till there was no one left.

01:05:44.074 --> 01:05:46.944
In spite of everything
we've done to them,

01:05:48.478 --> 01:05:51.315
everything we've put
them through.

01:05:58.421 --> 01:06:00.088
At least we gave
them the tools

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:01.792
they'll need to survive.

01:06:04.326 --> 01:06:07.397
Maybe they'll succeed
where we've failed.

01:06:11.167 --> 01:06:13.770
Are you really telling me
that you're giving up?

01:06:15.004 --> 01:06:16.739
After everything?

01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:21.511
It's not about
giving up, Janson.

01:06:23.446 --> 01:06:26.283
It's about knowing
when you've lost.

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:51.106
Gally?

01:06:51.108 --> 01:06:52.909
Here's how this is gonna go.

01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:56.777
We're gonna ask you
some questions,

01:06:56.779 --> 01:06:59.681
and you're gonna tell us
exactly what we need to know.

01:06:59.683 --> 01:07:03.185
We'll start off simple.
Where's Minho?

01:07:03.187 --> 01:07:05.353
You guys don't
seriously think...

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:07.121
Don't look at him.

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:08.922
Why are you looking at him?

01:07:08.924 --> 01:07:10.424
Look at me.

01:07:10.426 --> 01:07:12.528
He's not gonna help you.

01:07:15.199 --> 01:07:17.368
Now, we know you have Minho
in the building.

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:19.536
Where?

01:07:21.071 --> 01:07:23.170
He's with the others
in holding.

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:24.774
Sublevel three.

01:07:25.643 --> 01:07:27.344
How many others?

01:07:28.745 --> 01:07:30.013
28.

01:07:32.114 --> 01:07:33.880
I can make that work.

01:07:33.882 --> 01:07:35.984
No.
No, you guys don't understand.

01:07:35.986 --> 01:07:38.719
The whole level's restricted.

01:07:38.721 --> 01:07:40.721
You can't get in
without a thumbprint ID.

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:42.692
That's why you're
gonna come with us.

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:44.994
Well, I don't know.

01:07:46.094 --> 01:07:48.332
We don't necessarily need her.

01:07:48.998 --> 01:07:50.000
Right?

01:07:51.768 --> 01:07:53.868
Not all of her.

01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:56.136
- We just need her finger.
- Gally, back off.

01:07:56.138 --> 01:07:57.371
What,
are you squeamish?

01:07:57.373 --> 01:07:59.340
I guarantee you she's done
a lot worse to Minho.

01:07:59.342 --> 01:08:01.009
That's not the plan.
Back off.

01:08:01.011 --> 01:08:02.476
It won't make
a difference.

01:08:02.478 --> 01:08:04.011
Do whatever you want to me.

01:08:04.013 --> 01:08:05.746
You still won't get through
the front door.

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:07.014
The sensors will
pick you up the...

01:08:07.016 --> 01:08:08.719
We know. We're tagged.

01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:11.688
Property of WICKED.

01:08:15.192 --> 01:08:17.328
You're gonna help us
with that, too.

01:08:23.131 --> 01:08:25.635
Try to relax.
This is gonna sting.

01:08:26.603 --> 01:08:28.572
Let's just get it over with.

01:08:38.813 --> 01:08:40.345
She enjoyed that.

01:08:40.348 --> 01:08:41.982
You're probably right.

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:44.218
Here. See if these fit.

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:46.357
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Newt.

01:08:50.693 --> 01:08:52.763
Better get going,
old man.

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:55.398
Long road ahead of you.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.166
You sure I can't
talk you out of this?

01:08:59.167 --> 01:09:00.671
It's your last chance.

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:06.407
You know, it's not like you
to shy away from a fight.

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:09.009
And it's not like you
to go looking for one.

01:09:09.011 --> 01:09:11.312
I just can't help but think
if I walk out that door...

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:12.983
I'm never gonna see you again.

01:09:14.617 --> 01:09:17.888
Since when do we go sticking
our necks out for strangers?

01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:22.792
I was a stranger once, too.

01:09:32.134 --> 01:09:34.103
- Just don't leave us hanging.
- No.

01:09:35.638 --> 01:09:36.706
Never.

01:09:44.448 --> 01:09:46.846
She's looking good.

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:47.950
Healthy.

01:09:49.818 --> 01:09:52.054
How've you been
getting her serum?

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.491
What are you talking about?

01:09:56.725 --> 01:09:57.795
Brenda.

01:09:59.828 --> 01:10:01.998
I didn't think
she'd still be alive.

01:10:04.734 --> 01:10:06.502
When was her last treatment?

01:10:07.403 --> 01:10:08.939
At the Right Arm.

01:10:10.073 --> 01:10:11.942
The last time we saw you.

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:17.681
But that was months ago.

01:10:22.417 --> 01:10:24.719
Thomas, that's not possible.

01:10:26.254 --> 01:10:28.654
She should have turned by now.

01:10:28.656 --> 01:10:30.390
There's no way she
could possibly still...

01:10:30.392 --> 01:10:31.994
All right, that's enough.

01:10:33.696 --> 01:10:34.898
You don't believe me?

01:10:35.698 --> 01:10:37.835
Do you really
expect me to?

01:10:40.603 --> 01:10:42.605
You made your choice.

01:10:43.607 --> 01:10:45.742
Everything okay over here?

01:10:49.312 --> 01:10:50.514
Yeah.

01:10:51.147 --> 01:10:52.683
Yeah, we're done.

01:11:03.893 --> 01:11:05.162
Nice try.

01:11:14.336 --> 01:11:16.171
You were in love with her,
weren't you?

01:11:19.474 --> 01:11:20.843
I don't know.

01:11:25.014 --> 01:11:26.512
Just be careful.

01:11:26.514 --> 01:11:27.647
You sort of have this problem

01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:29.852
where you can't
walk away from people.

01:11:31.053 --> 01:11:32.656
Even when you should.

01:11:34.823 --> 01:11:37.293
You can't save everyone,
Thomas.

01:11:42.064 --> 01:11:43.599
I can try.

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:12.862
Don't stop.

01:13:02.176 --> 01:13:03.775
Go, go, go.

01:13:03.777 --> 01:13:05.179
Hold on. Hold on.

01:13:06.146 --> 01:13:07.412
I can get in here.

01:13:07.414 --> 01:13:09.316
Stay there.
Throw me the walkie.

01:13:31.874 --> 01:13:34.140
Frypan, we're in.
How you doing?

01:13:35.878 --> 01:13:38.080
Yeah, I'm getting there.

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.347
Tell Minho "Hi," for me.

01:13:41.349 --> 01:13:42.985
<i>Hang in there, buddy.</i>

01:13:48.255 --> 01:13:49.787
This'll work.

01:13:49.789 --> 01:13:51.456
Brenda, what's your status?

01:13:51.458 --> 01:13:54.091
Status is, I'm working on it.

01:13:54.093 --> 01:13:56.330
<i>Copy. Just make sure
you're ready on your end.</i>

01:13:58.833 --> 01:14:00.969
Don't worry.
You know I'm gonna be there.

01:14:05.706 --> 01:14:07.409
All right, let's go.

01:14:13.114 --> 01:14:14.315
We got a signal.

01:14:15.316 --> 01:14:17.248
Gally did it.

01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:18.352
We're in.

01:14:21.223 --> 01:14:22.291
Good.

01:14:23.658 --> 01:14:25.326
Give me everything.

01:14:26.495 --> 01:14:28.430
I want full control.

01:14:30.698 --> 01:14:33.001
That's funny.
System's glitching.

01:14:34.803 --> 01:14:36.705
I'll go check it out.

01:14:52.786 --> 01:14:55.220
Get back, get back! Move!

01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:14.340
Come on, let's go.

01:15:14.342 --> 01:15:16.775
- Get them open.
- Let's go.

01:15:16.777 --> 01:15:18.311
It's okay.
You guys are okay. Come on.

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:21.150
Come on, let's go.
Newt, check the other cell.

01:15:22.049 --> 01:15:24.051
Come on, you guys are okay.
Come on.

01:15:24.053 --> 01:15:26.088
The vault. How do I get in?

01:15:27.554 --> 01:15:28.956
You can't.

01:15:31.758 --> 01:15:33.292
Come on, guys. Come on.

01:15:33.294 --> 01:15:34.926
Guys,

01:15:34.928 --> 01:15:36.830
this might take some time.

01:15:41.235 --> 01:15:42.237
Shit.

01:15:43.303 --> 01:15:44.505
He's not here.

01:15:45.271 --> 01:15:46.807
Where is he?

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:56.416
This really couldn't wait
till morning?

01:15:57.552 --> 01:15:58.984
You realize this could
kill him, right?

01:15:58.986 --> 01:16:00.484
Taking this much,
all at once.

01:16:00.486 --> 01:16:02.253
I have my orders.

01:16:02.255 --> 01:16:03.958
Janson wants it all.

01:16:12.999 --> 01:16:16.336
Somebody's moved him up
to the medical wing.

01:16:16.338 --> 01:16:19.206
Thomas, that's on the other
side of the building.

01:16:21.075 --> 01:16:22.873
Okay, take me to him.
Right now.

01:16:22.875 --> 01:16:24.443
All right.
I'm coming with you.

01:16:24.445 --> 01:16:25.543
Newt, no, you're not.

01:16:25.545 --> 01:16:27.979
You have to stay here,
wait with Gally for the serum.

01:16:27.981 --> 01:16:30.082
You can't do this on your own.

01:16:30.084 --> 01:16:31.486
Minho comes first, remember?

01:16:32.419 --> 01:16:34.019
Just go. We're wasting time.

01:16:34.021 --> 01:16:36.124
I'll get the serum.
We'll meet you out back.

01:16:37.758 --> 01:16:39.861
Okay, fine.
Let's go. Come on.

01:16:41.762 --> 01:16:43.063
Hey, Greenie.

01:16:43.630 --> 01:16:44.865
Good luck.

01:16:56.576 --> 01:16:57.978
Keep moving.

01:17:11.657 --> 01:17:13.127
Come on, come on.

01:17:30.444 --> 01:17:31.512
Hold it.

01:17:49.495 --> 01:17:51.031
You're working late.

01:17:54.101 --> 01:17:56.569
See, that's what I like
about you, Teresa.

01:17:56.571 --> 01:17:59.738
No matter how bleak
things get, you just...

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:01.275
Well, you never give up.

01:18:02.376 --> 01:18:04.108
Times like this,

01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:06.246
you need a friend
that you can count on.

01:18:09.083 --> 01:18:10.985
I'll bear that in mind.

01:18:14.954 --> 01:18:17.024
There is one thing
you should know.

01:18:18.025 --> 01:18:19.661
One friend to another.

01:18:21.861 --> 01:18:23.563
Thomas is here.

01:18:32.306 --> 01:18:35.707
A surveillance picked him up
outside the walls.

01:18:35.709 --> 01:18:37.042
Ava didn't want you to know,

01:18:37.044 --> 01:18:39.644
but there is a chance that he
may try to contact you,

01:18:39.646 --> 01:18:41.181
and if he does,

01:18:44.218 --> 01:18:47.255
I'd like to think that
I'd be your first call.

01:18:49.923 --> 01:18:51.458
Are you going to kill him?

01:18:53.892 --> 01:18:55.595
Would that be a problem?

01:19:01.467 --> 01:19:02.636
This is me.

01:19:28.696 --> 01:19:30.394
Thomas, you have
to listen to me.

01:19:30.396 --> 01:19:32.396
Getting that serum
won't save Newt.

01:19:32.398 --> 01:19:34.166
It might buy him
some time, but...

01:19:34.168 --> 01:19:35.234
Just ignore her.

01:19:35.236 --> 01:19:36.502
She's trying to get
inside your head.

01:19:36.504 --> 01:19:39.037
Thomas, listen. You know
what's going on out there.

01:19:39.039 --> 01:19:42.107
People are dying.
The world is dying.

01:19:42.109 --> 01:19:44.908
There's something about
your blood I don't understand.

01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:46.777
Open it.

01:19:46.779 --> 01:19:49.313
If you let me run
some tests...

01:19:49.315 --> 01:19:51.282
I promise I can protect you.

01:19:51.284 --> 01:19:53.651
Yeah?
Like you protected Minho?

01:19:53.653 --> 01:19:54.786
What are you doing?

01:19:54.788 --> 01:19:56.187
How many people
is it gonna take?

01:19:56.189 --> 01:19:57.721
How many more people
do they have to round up,

01:19:57.723 --> 01:19:58.857
torture, kill?

01:19:58.859 --> 01:20:00.058
Huh? When the hell
does it stop?

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:01.793
It stops when we find a cure.

01:20:01.795 --> 01:20:03.664
There is no goddamn cure!

01:20:05.865 --> 01:20:08.235
Don't waste your breath,
Teresa.

01:20:10.905 --> 01:20:12.871
He made his choice long ago.

01:20:12.873 --> 01:20:14.075
Drop it, kid!

01:20:17.143 --> 01:20:19.577
Back up.
Tell them to back off.

01:20:19.579 --> 01:20:20.778
Tell them to back off!

01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:22.579
Hey, Thomas, come on.

01:20:22.581 --> 01:20:23.916
It's me.

01:20:23.918 --> 01:20:25.884
I've known you longer
than you can remember.

01:20:25.886 --> 01:20:27.853
You're not gonna shoot her.

01:20:27.855 --> 01:20:29.490
You don't think so?

01:20:31.392 --> 01:20:32.460
Okay.

01:20:32.892 --> 01:20:34.395
Go on then.

01:20:37.596 --> 01:20:39.130
Shoot her.

01:20:40.566 --> 01:20:42.135
Prove me wrong.

01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:49.508
Shoot her.

01:20:56.484 --> 01:20:57.517
Clear! Clear!

01:20:58.185 --> 01:20:59.387
Move! Move!

01:21:11.097 --> 01:21:13.030
Your story better be good.

01:21:13.032 --> 01:21:14.934
I just did you a favor.

01:21:14.936 --> 01:21:17.269
Doors are sealed.
They can't get out.

01:21:17.271 --> 01:21:20.573
Janson, I need them alive.

01:21:20.575 --> 01:21:22.607
- Come on. Come on!
- All right, let's move!

01:21:22.609 --> 01:21:24.779
Yes, sir!
Level three, now!

01:21:31.516 --> 01:21:34.419
Okay. We need to get
outta here now.

01:21:34.421 --> 01:21:37.755
You stay close to me.
Stick together.

01:21:37.757 --> 01:21:41.895
You, you guard this with
your life. You understand?

01:21:43.596 --> 01:21:44.798
All right.

01:21:45.864 --> 01:21:48.166
Let's go.

01:21:48.168 --> 01:21:51.535
Lock down the building.
Send everyone up to 20.

01:21:51.537 --> 01:21:53.271
And someone shut off
those goddamn sirens!

01:21:53.273 --> 01:21:54.474
Yes, sir.

01:22:00.146 --> 01:22:01.613
Move! Move!

01:22:01.615 --> 01:22:02.716
Stay low! Stay low!

01:22:03.616 --> 01:22:05.183
Go! Go! Go!

01:22:05.185 --> 01:22:07.252
Go! Stay low! Stay low!

01:22:07.254 --> 01:22:09.290
Brenda, where are you?
We're here.

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.393
Come on, let's go.

01:22:14.395 --> 01:22:17.195
All right. Let's go, let's go.
Quickly, quickly.

01:22:17.197 --> 01:22:19.296
Front and back,
front and back. Let's go.

01:22:19.298 --> 01:22:20.863
Wait, where's Thomas?

01:22:20.865 --> 01:22:21.999
I was hoping he was with you.

01:22:22.001 --> 01:22:23.100
Come on.

01:22:23.102 --> 01:22:24.904
Wait! Wait!
Stay here with the kids.

01:22:25.672 --> 01:22:26.873
Wait here...

01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:29.173
I'll find him.

01:22:29.175 --> 01:22:31.241
Just wait for us, okay?

01:22:31.243 --> 01:22:33.143
We're not going anywhere.

01:22:33.145 --> 01:22:34.210
Anything?

01:22:34.212 --> 01:22:35.411
No sign of them yet, sir.

01:22:35.413 --> 01:22:36.479
Yeah, well,
they're here somewhere.

01:22:36.481 --> 01:22:37.747
They can't get out. Find them.

01:22:37.749 --> 01:22:38.616
You two, that way.

01:22:38.618 --> 01:22:39.716
The rest of you,
follow me. Let's go.

01:22:39.718 --> 01:22:41.587
- Yes, sir!
- Affirmative.

01:22:45.358 --> 01:22:47.858
<i>Code 22 in progress.</i>

01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:51.699
<i>All R-16 personnel, report
to their assigned stations.</i>

01:23:04.245 --> 01:23:06.214
Get down. Get down.

01:23:13.819 --> 01:23:15.819
Move! Move! Move!

01:23:15.821 --> 01:23:17.324
Stay quiet.

01:23:24.062 --> 01:23:25.598
Got someone here.

01:23:38.110 --> 01:23:39.945
Sorry, Thomas.

01:23:46.687 --> 01:23:48.185
Hey,
someone's got the bus.

01:23:48.187 --> 01:23:49.253
Hold on!

01:23:50.490 --> 01:23:51.989
- Watch it!
- Stop!

01:23:51.991 --> 01:23:53.393
No, no, no!

01:23:55.161 --> 01:23:56.530
It's all right!

01:24:05.171 --> 01:24:06.370
Load up! Load up!

01:24:06.372 --> 01:24:08.104
Let's go! Move it!

01:24:08.106 --> 01:24:09.609
Move! Move!

01:24:10.610 --> 01:24:12.376
<i>All R-16 personnel,</i>

01:24:12.378 --> 01:24:14.447
<i>report to their
assigned stations.</i>

01:24:24.056 --> 01:24:25.822
Thomas! No!

01:24:35.834 --> 01:24:38.538
Minho? Minho!

01:24:39.437 --> 01:24:41.040
- Oh, shit!
- Freeze!

01:24:43.142 --> 01:24:44.411
Minho!

01:24:47.748 --> 01:24:49.083
Minho, where are you?

01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:53.550
Minho!

01:24:53.552 --> 01:24:55.819
Doctor,
he's coming out of it.

01:24:55.821 --> 01:24:57.356
Get me another sedative.

01:25:31.089 --> 01:25:32.425
Shit!

01:25:34.327 --> 01:25:36.495
Over here!
There they are!

01:25:41.133 --> 01:25:42.703
I'll cut him off!

01:25:45.203 --> 01:25:46.405
Newt, get down! t

01:25:49.007 --> 01:25:50.876
Shit! I'm almost out.

01:25:57.115 --> 01:25:58.118
Get back.

01:26:05.891 --> 01:26:07.390
Nice. All right.

01:26:07.392 --> 01:26:08.591
Let's go! Go!

01:26:08.593 --> 01:26:09.828
You two, freeze!

01:26:10.562 --> 01:26:12.395
Get down on the ground. Now!

01:26:12.397 --> 01:26:13.665
I said get your...

01:26:23.074 --> 01:26:24.140
Minho.

01:26:28.047 --> 01:26:29.115
Is this real?

01:26:30.783 --> 01:26:32.049
I got him!
I got him! Over here.

01:26:32.051 --> 01:26:33.052
Go! This way!

01:26:33.953 --> 01:26:35.021
Come on!

01:26:37.323 --> 01:26:39.426
You three! Stop!

01:26:43.262 --> 01:26:44.664
Come on.

01:26:46.199 --> 01:26:47.434
In here, in here.

01:26:54.405 --> 01:26:55.874
Newt, come on.

01:27:02.714 --> 01:27:04.281
Somebody get this door open.

01:27:04.283 --> 01:27:05.685
Yes, sir!

01:27:09.454 --> 01:27:10.656
Oh, shit.

01:27:31.110 --> 01:27:32.645
Any ideas?

01:27:36.214 --> 01:27:37.217
Maybe.

01:27:50.561 --> 01:27:52.731
Okay, it's doable.

01:27:54.633 --> 01:27:57.569
Just need
a little running start.

01:28:02.374 --> 01:28:04.207
Almost through.

01:28:04.209 --> 01:28:05.943
You sure about this?

01:28:05.945 --> 01:28:07.046
Not really.

01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:09.345
Nice pep talk.

01:28:09.347 --> 01:28:11.751
Yeah, we're all
bloody inspired.

01:28:18.357 --> 01:28:19.855
- Move it! Move it!
- Shit.

01:28:19.857 --> 01:28:20.859
Go! Go!

01:28:22.493 --> 01:28:23.992
Thomas!

01:28:23.994 --> 01:28:26.631
Oh, shit!

01:29:00.231 --> 01:29:01.833
- Minho, you okay?
- Yeah.

01:29:06.471 --> 01:29:08.671
You three, don't move.

01:29:08.673 --> 01:29:10.775
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

01:29:11.475 --> 01:29:13.110
Take it easy.

01:29:17.381 --> 01:29:20.883
Uh-uh-uh!
Don't even think about it.

01:29:20.885 --> 01:29:24.156
Get on your knees
with your hands in the air.

01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:29.729
You son of a bitch.

01:29:38.203 --> 01:29:39.271
Gally?

01:29:40.905 --> 01:29:41.908
Minho.

01:29:43.342 --> 01:29:44.877
You guys are nuts.

01:29:46.712 --> 01:29:48.615
I'll explain later.

01:29:52.851 --> 01:29:55.251
<i>Attention all personnel.</i>

01:29:55.253 --> 01:29:57.386
Drop the net.

01:29:57.388 --> 01:29:59.822
Declare martial law. No one
leaves until they're found.

01:29:59.824 --> 01:30:01.723
It's done, sir. We already
have eyes on the bus.

01:30:01.725 --> 01:30:02.927
Our patrols are in pursuit.

01:30:04.662 --> 01:30:06.263
What bus?

01:30:09.301 --> 01:30:11.670
Shit! Hold on!

01:30:35.494 --> 01:30:36.696
Shit!

01:31:04.555 --> 01:31:06.358
Get out of the vehicle.

01:31:10.728 --> 01:31:12.197
Don't move.

01:31:14.765 --> 01:31:16.300
You're doing great.

01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:25.343
Now step away
from the vehicle.

01:31:26.677 --> 01:31:28.679
I said step away
from the vehicle!

01:31:28.681 --> 01:31:30.415
Put your hands in the air.

01:31:39.158 --> 01:31:40.459
Drop the weapon!

01:31:58.743 --> 01:32:00.178
Here we go.

01:32:06.283 --> 01:32:08.083
Push in! Push in! Go! Go!

01:32:08.085 --> 01:32:10.756
- That bus does not leave!
- Move! Move in!

01:32:11.689 --> 01:32:13.392
Come on, hold on to something!

01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:17.493
Here we go.

01:32:17.495 --> 01:32:20.165
Circle up! Go! Go!
Hold fire!

01:32:32.778 --> 01:32:34.012
Brace yourself.

01:32:37.614 --> 01:32:38.849
Sorry.

01:32:46.724 --> 01:32:48.059
Shit.

01:33:23.695 --> 01:33:25.962
Hold on to something!

01:33:50.755 --> 01:33:52.157
t

01:34:10.109 --> 01:34:12.311
Okay. Everybody off.

01:34:34.765 --> 01:34:36.233
Shut up.

01:34:46.743 --> 01:34:48.412
They're not out yet.

01:35:04.763 --> 01:35:07.600
Well, they're
definitely pissed.

01:35:08.734 --> 01:35:10.335
How far are the tunnels?

01:35:11.734 --> 01:35:13.068
Uh, maybe 12 blocks from here.

01:35:18.643 --> 01:35:20.145
We can make it.

01:35:23.914 --> 01:35:26.315
Newt, how are you feeling?

01:35:27.885 --> 01:35:29.253
Terrible.

01:35:30.587 --> 01:35:32.588
It's good to see you though.

01:35:37.895 --> 01:35:39.130
Hey.

01:35:39.963 --> 01:35:42.033
How long has he been
like this?

01:35:43.167 --> 01:35:45.737
He'll be okay.
We just gotta get to Brenda.

01:35:48.104 --> 01:35:50.138
She's got the serum.

01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:51.874
Come on, let's go.

01:35:51.876 --> 01:35:53.342
Hey, Newt.

01:35:53.344 --> 01:35:55.343
Come on, bud.
We gotta get you up. Let's go.

01:35:55.345 --> 01:35:56.611
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:35:56.613 --> 01:35:58.183
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:36:00.052 --> 01:36:02.418
Why you helping us, Gally?

01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:04.989
I put a spear
through your chest.

01:36:06.491 --> 01:36:07.492
Yeah.

01:36:08.525 --> 01:36:10.295
Nobody's perfect, man.

01:36:37.521 --> 01:36:38.689
Lawrence!

01:36:39.857 --> 01:36:41.792
Wait, guys.
Wait, wait, wait.

01:36:45.627 --> 01:36:47.497
Where is everyone?

01:36:49.532 --> 01:36:51.134
Wait here, guys. Wait.

01:36:51.701 --> 01:36:53.135
Thomas!

01:36:53.669 --> 01:36:54.804
Hey!

01:36:55.671 --> 01:36:56.807
Lawrence!

01:36:57.674 --> 01:36:59.376
Everything's gone.

01:37:39.015 --> 01:37:41.082
Don't be scared.

01:37:41.084 --> 01:37:43.220
I may not be pretty,

01:37:44.151 --> 01:37:47.054
but we all know who
the enemies are,

01:37:47.056 --> 01:37:49.222
cowering behind those walls!

01:37:52.862 --> 01:37:54.430
They have a name

01:37:55.298 --> 01:37:58.033
for people like us in there.

01:37:58.035 --> 01:38:00.304
They call us Cranks!

01:38:01.304 --> 01:38:03.805
But I say that
they are the monsters.

01:38:05.375 --> 01:38:07.741
They're the ones
who started this war,

01:38:07.743 --> 01:38:08.745
but tonight,

01:38:09.812 --> 01:38:11.448
we will finish it.

01:38:12.616 --> 01:38:15.049
Follow me.

01:38:15.051 --> 01:38:16.984
Follow me,
and we will show them

01:38:16.986 --> 01:38:18.587
the faces of the people

01:38:18.589 --> 01:38:21.189
that they have chosen
to forget!

01:38:25.562 --> 01:38:28.499
Follow me
and this city is yours!

01:38:30.733 --> 01:38:32.135
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

01:38:53.023 --> 01:38:54.791
Let's move it!

01:38:57.193 --> 01:38:58.762
Let's go!

01:39:11.608 --> 01:39:13.240
<i>Control,
you seeing this?</i>

01:39:13.242 --> 01:39:14.909
<i>Please advise.</i>

01:39:14.911 --> 01:39:16.043
Holy shit.

01:39:16.045 --> 01:39:18.548
Get turrets one
and two ready to fire.

01:39:26.355 --> 01:39:27.956
Guns aren't responding.
I'm locked out.

01:39:30.259 --> 01:39:31.858
All right. Move forward.

01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:33.829
Open fire! Open fire!

01:39:56.318 --> 01:39:57.752
We're supposed
to take down WICKED,

01:39:57.754 --> 01:39:59.223
not the whole damn city.

01:40:03.225 --> 01:40:04.859
Gally, come on.

01:40:17.439 --> 01:40:19.739
<i>This is
a mandatory evacuation.</i>

01:40:19.741 --> 01:40:23.008
<i>The last transport leaves
in 38 minutes.</i>

01:40:23.010 --> 01:40:25.211
<i>Please proceed to the roof.</i>

01:40:25.213 --> 01:40:27.713
<i>I repeat, this is
a mandatory evacuation.</i>

01:40:27.715 --> 01:40:31.084
Teresa, what are you still
doing here? We have to leave.

01:40:31.086 --> 01:40:33.753
No, I can't leave.
Not without Thomas.

01:40:33.755 --> 01:40:35.489
It's too late for that.
He's gone.

01:40:35.491 --> 01:40:38.757
No. You don't understand.

01:40:38.759 --> 01:40:40.329
I need more.

01:40:40.995 --> 01:40:42.633
Come. Look.

01:40:46.469 --> 01:40:48.037
It's not just slowing
the virus down.

01:40:52.341 --> 01:40:54.411
It's destroying it.

01:40:58.915 --> 01:41:00.984
We need to find Thomas.

01:41:02.251 --> 01:41:03.918
Tunnels are right up ahead.

01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:05.186
Shit!

01:41:05.188 --> 01:41:07.758
Hey! Stay low! Stay low!

01:41:16.932 --> 01:41:18.334
Shit!

01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:20.466
Get ready!

01:41:20.468 --> 01:41:22.435
All right, move up! Move up!

01:41:22.437 --> 01:41:23.772
Frontline down!

01:41:25.807 --> 01:41:27.043
Damn it!

01:41:30.012 --> 01:41:31.778
What are they waiting for?

01:41:39.488 --> 01:41:40.956
Get down, get down!

01:41:48.430 --> 01:41:49.965
Stay down! Stay down!

01:41:56.205 --> 01:41:57.506
We gotta go. We gotta go.

01:42:00.608 --> 01:42:02.745
Come on.
Let's move, let's move.

01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:21.496
<i>Get him in, get him in.</i>

01:42:23.165 --> 01:42:25.332
<i>Brenda, are you there?</i>

01:42:25.334 --> 01:42:26.999
Thomas, I'm here.

01:42:28.236 --> 01:42:30.373
Shit! You okay?

01:42:31.138 --> 01:42:32.941
We're not gonna make it.

01:42:34.477 --> 01:42:36.509
Wait, what are you
talking about?

01:42:36.511 --> 01:42:38.245
Don't let them get away!

01:42:38.247 --> 01:42:40.448
Just take the others.
Get everybody out

01:42:40.450 --> 01:42:41.952
<i>while you still can.</i>

01:42:42.718 --> 01:42:43.787
No.

01:42:44.987 --> 01:42:46.390
Brenda.

01:42:47.424 --> 01:42:49.059
I'm not leaving you.

01:42:49.858 --> 01:42:50.893
Okay?

01:42:51.527 --> 01:42:53.528
So forget it.

01:42:56.330 --> 01:42:58.066
Even though you should?

01:43:13.449 --> 01:43:18.350
<i>Thomas, don't worry.
I'm coming to you.</i>

01:43:18.352 --> 01:43:19.721
What are you talking about?

01:43:21.557 --> 01:43:23.989
Our ride's here!

01:43:28.998 --> 01:43:31.067
<i>Just look for us
near the tunnels.</i>

01:43:34.504 --> 01:43:36.637
Let's go, guys! Move!
Our ride's here!

01:43:36.639 --> 01:43:38.238
- Careful.
- Move! Move!

01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:40.477
Watch your step. Okay?

01:43:45.781 --> 01:43:46.813
Vince?

01:43:46.815 --> 01:43:49.382
Hey, it's good
to see you, too.

01:43:49.384 --> 01:43:50.883
Yeah, I know.

01:43:50.885 --> 01:43:52.418
I picked up a stray.

01:43:52.420 --> 01:43:53.485
Let's get out of here,
all right?

01:43:53.487 --> 01:43:54.721
We're not done yet.

01:43:54.723 --> 01:43:56.892
Thomas is still inside.

01:44:00.361 --> 01:44:02.862
Well, let's go get him then.

01:44:02.864 --> 01:44:04.096
- Hell yeah.
- All right, let's go.

01:44:04.098 --> 01:44:05.698
- On board. Everybody.
- Let's go! Step up! Step up!

01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:07.569
- We gotta move, we gotta move.
- Take a seat, harness...

01:44:17.012 --> 01:44:19.179
All right.
Newt, we're almost there.

01:44:19.181 --> 01:44:20.816
Just leave me.

01:44:24.585 --> 01:44:25.985
Back! Back!

01:44:25.987 --> 01:44:27.756
Let's go! Let's go!

01:44:29.225 --> 01:44:30.527
Take 'em out!

01:44:47.509 --> 01:44:49.108
- Okay, that's them.
- Yeah.

01:44:49.110 --> 01:44:50.409
It's them. We gotta go.

01:44:50.411 --> 01:44:51.478
- We gotta go.
- Go without me, man.

01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:52.714
You should just...

01:45:01.757 --> 01:45:03.523
Minho.

01:45:03.525 --> 01:45:05.825
You gotta run ahead,
grab the serum,

01:45:05.827 --> 01:45:08.062
and get back to us
as soon as you can.

01:45:11.098 --> 01:45:12.767
Minho, go.

01:45:13.602 --> 01:45:15.871
He's right. I can cover.

01:45:21.242 --> 01:45:22.611
Thank you.

01:45:23.378 --> 01:45:24.781
Thank you, Minho.

01:45:26.114 --> 01:45:28.851
Hey, you just hang on.

01:45:29.384 --> 01:45:31.020
You hear me?

01:45:36.090 --> 01:45:37.726
Go, Minho, go!

01:45:40.361 --> 01:45:42.096
Okay, they're through.

01:46:05.753 --> 01:46:07.188
Newt? Newt?

01:46:08.123 --> 01:46:10.593
Hey! Hey! Newt! Hey!

01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:13.725
We're gonna try this. Okay?

01:46:13.727 --> 01:46:16.363
We gotta move, now.
Let's get you up, come on.

01:46:16.365 --> 01:46:17.796
- Let's go, come on.
- No. No, Thomas.

01:46:17.798 --> 01:46:19.730
No, Newt. Later. Later.
Really gotta go.

01:46:19.732 --> 01:46:20.934
- Come on.
- Look, you gotta take this.

01:46:20.936 --> 01:46:22.601
- We gotta get you up, now.
- No, just take it!

01:46:27.107 --> 01:46:28.341
Please.

01:46:28.343 --> 01:46:30.813
Please, Tommy. Please.

01:46:33.115 --> 01:46:34.282
All right.

01:46:39.454 --> 01:46:42.054
All right. I need you
to give me everything you got.

01:46:42.056 --> 01:46:43.922
You and me, right now.
Let's go. You ready?

01:46:43.924 --> 01:46:46.193
Come on, ready? Here we go.

01:46:46.195 --> 01:46:48.063
One, two, three.

01:47:05.746 --> 01:47:07.313
Get back, guys, get back!

01:47:07.315 --> 01:47:08.347
Oh, man.

01:47:08.349 --> 01:47:10.315
It's okay, guys. We're getting
out of here soon.

01:47:10.317 --> 01:47:11.985
We can't stay here, Bren.

01:47:12.753 --> 01:47:15.720
Don't worry. They'll be here.

01:47:15.722 --> 01:47:17.226
Come on. Come on.

01:47:26.134 --> 01:47:28.333
We're almost there, Newt.
Stay with me, come on.

01:47:29.470 --> 01:47:31.872
Newt, no, no. Hey!

01:47:37.579 --> 01:47:38.847
Come on.

01:47:53.394 --> 01:47:54.830
<i>Thomas?</i>

01:47:58.400 --> 01:47:59.768
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

01:48:02.335 --> 01:48:03.704
<i>I need you to listen to me.</i>

01:48:05.239 --> 01:48:07.942
I know you have
no reason to trust me,

01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:14.383
but I need you to come back.

01:48:17.818 --> 01:48:21.289
<i>Thomas, you can save Newt.</i>

01:48:23.023 --> 01:48:25.259
<i>There's still time for him.</i>

01:48:26.995 --> 01:48:30.529
There's a reason
Brenda isn't sick anymore.

01:48:30.531 --> 01:48:32.366
<i>It's your blood.</i>

01:48:33.334 --> 01:48:35.870
<i>Do you understand?</i>

01:48:36.704 --> 01:48:38.507
<i>She isn't sick,</i>

01:48:39.473 --> 01:48:41.476
<i>because you cured her.</i>

01:48:44.646 --> 01:48:47.116
<i>She doesn't have to be
the only one.</i>

01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:51.650
<i>All you have to do
is come back.</i>

01:48:51.652 --> 01:48:54.122
<i>And this will all
finally be over.</i>

01:48:58.057 --> 01:48:59.092
Please.

01:49:00.793 --> 01:49:02.829
Just come back to me.

01:49:04.865 --> 01:49:06.334
<i>I know you'll do the right...</i>

01:49:21.583 --> 01:49:22.785
Newt?

01:49:32.526 --> 01:49:34.061
Newt?

01:49:37.197 --> 01:49:40.201
Newt? Newt, it's me. It's me!

01:49:46.338 --> 01:49:47.408
Brenda!

01:49:49.308 --> 01:49:50.608
Where's the serum?

01:49:54.748 --> 01:49:57.317
Tommy, kill me!

01:49:57.817 --> 01:50:00.288
Newt, I'm here.

01:50:06.661 --> 01:50:09.263
Newt, please!

01:50:10.298 --> 01:50:11.831
Please!

01:50:17.938 --> 01:50:20.575
I'm sorry, Tommy.

01:50:21.509 --> 01:50:23.345
It's okay. It's okay.

01:50:27.482 --> 01:50:28.917
No!

01:50:32.452 --> 01:50:34.319
Brenda!

01:50:34.321 --> 01:50:35.886
Thomas!

01:50:35.888 --> 01:50:37.290
Stay down, stay down!

01:51:03.317 --> 01:51:04.452
Newt.

01:51:21.369 --> 01:51:22.470
Tommy.

01:51:27.374 --> 01:51:28.409
No, no.

01:51:37.417 --> 01:51:39.286
No, no, no.

01:51:44.624 --> 01:51:45.625
Newt?

01:53:53.021 --> 01:53:54.456
Is it true?

01:53:58.660 --> 01:53:59.661
Newt.

01:54:03.062 --> 01:54:04.632
Could I have saved him?

01:54:07.967 --> 01:54:10.070
You can save us all.

01:54:32.793 --> 01:54:33.861
It's okay.

01:54:37.698 --> 01:54:39.732
Just leave the others alone.

01:54:43.102 --> 01:54:44.571
I promise.

01:54:48.910 --> 01:54:50.211
I will...

01:55:45.932 --> 01:55:47.535
Oh, Thomas.

01:55:52.806 --> 01:55:54.842
You should have run.

01:55:57.643 --> 01:55:58.846
<i>Thomas.</i>

01:56:00.814 --> 01:56:03.281
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

01:56:29.542 --> 01:56:31.879
Do you know what
this place is, Thomas?

01:56:35.780 --> 01:56:37.617
It's a lifeboat.

01:56:39.084 --> 01:56:42.386
And the whole world
might be sinking,

01:56:42.388 --> 01:56:45.292
but doesn't mean that
we have to go down with it.

01:56:47.727 --> 01:56:49.393
How much longer?

01:56:49.395 --> 01:56:51.232
It's almost done.

01:56:56.369 --> 01:56:57.835
Why don't you just kill me?

01:56:57.837 --> 01:56:59.240
Kill you?

01:57:00.106 --> 01:57:02.276
No, we don't wanna do that.

01:57:05.145 --> 01:57:07.781
We're gonna take
special care of you.

01:57:09.015 --> 01:57:10.718
We'll keep you alive.

01:57:11.351 --> 01:57:12.585
Just.

01:57:15.288 --> 01:57:17.455
And in return,

01:57:17.457 --> 01:57:20.358
you will give life
to the rest of us.

01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:22.997
The ones we choose
to save, anyway.

01:57:26.733 --> 01:57:29.599
Of course, there's not gonna
be enough for everyone.

01:57:29.601 --> 01:57:31.867
Hard choices are gonna
have to be made.

01:57:31.869 --> 01:57:34.905
In time, the Flare virus
will burn itself out.

01:57:34.907 --> 01:57:36.572
The only question is,

01:57:36.574 --> 01:57:40.513
who will be the ones
left standing?

01:57:42.915 --> 01:57:46.083
And thanks to you,
to this,

01:57:46.085 --> 01:57:48.756
we finally get to choose.

01:57:50.957 --> 01:57:54.427
A future of our own making.

01:58:01.101 --> 01:58:02.335
To your health.

01:58:10.142 --> 01:58:12.011
Okay, let's get out of here.

01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:16.083
Come on.

01:58:20.386 --> 01:58:21.587
No!

01:58:28.327 --> 01:58:30.594
Get back here.

01:58:30.596 --> 01:58:31.829
Get back!

01:58:31.831 --> 01:58:32.931
No!

01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:35.668
Give it to me.

01:58:38.372 --> 01:58:39.673
Give it to me!

01:58:41.374 --> 01:58:42.609
Teresa!

01:59:17.943 --> 01:59:19.412
Come on.

01:59:31.790 --> 01:59:33.159
Okay.

01:59:34.328 --> 01:59:35.661
That's enough.

01:59:47.207 --> 01:59:48.506
Weapons ready!

01:59:48.508 --> 01:59:49.974
On my command.

01:59:49.976 --> 01:59:52.010
Charge it!

01:59:52.012 --> 01:59:53.747
Ready.

01:59:54.146 --> 01:59:55.181
Fire!

02:00:07.926 --> 02:00:09.162
Teresa!

02:00:18.069 --> 02:00:20.072
We need to get out of here.

02:00:20.907 --> 02:00:22.472
What's wrong?

02:00:25.843 --> 02:00:26.878
Thomas?

02:00:28.013 --> 02:00:29.216
Thomas!

02:00:35.922 --> 02:00:37.790
- Okay. Okay, we need to...
- Oh, shit...

02:00:39.125 --> 02:00:41.661
Find something.
Here. Here!

02:00:42.728 --> 02:00:45.362
Just put pressure on it.
Hold it.

02:00:46.965 --> 02:00:48.200
You gotta go.

02:00:49.333 --> 02:00:51.235
You gotta go.

02:00:51.237 --> 02:00:52.237
No.

02:00:53.171 --> 02:00:54.639
Not without you.

02:01:20.598 --> 02:01:23.001
I admit, Teresa,
you had me fooled.

02:01:24.636 --> 02:01:26.872
I thought we were friends.

02:01:32.778 --> 02:01:35.179
Maybe it's just
in your nature to betray

02:01:35.181 --> 02:01:37.717
the people closest to you.

02:01:44.889 --> 02:01:46.558
Come on.

02:01:48.391 --> 02:01:50.862
Let's not prolong this.

02:01:53.131 --> 02:01:56.001
We both know
there's no way outta here.

02:01:59.804 --> 02:02:01.637
Let's not make this
any more painful

02:02:01.639 --> 02:02:03.808
than it needs to be.

02:02:08.112 --> 02:02:09.114
Thomas.

02:02:13.117 --> 02:02:14.119
Teresa.

02:02:29.333 --> 02:02:31.202
No. No.

02:02:34.439 --> 02:02:37.676
I think you have
something of mine.

02:02:47.283 --> 02:02:48.752
Not that.

02:02:50.421 --> 02:02:51.890
Where is he?

02:02:52.424 --> 02:02:54.623
Just take it.

02:02:54.625 --> 02:02:56.392
Leave him alone.

02:02:56.394 --> 02:02:58.196
What is it with you two?

02:02:58.897 --> 02:03:02.164
You think he's so special?

02:03:02.166 --> 02:03:04.299
He's a lab rat.
He was born with a gift.

02:03:04.301 --> 02:03:07.803
He never had to fight for it,
he never earned it.

02:03:07.805 --> 02:03:09.908
He doesn't deserve it.

02:03:10.507 --> 02:03:12.010
Maybe.

02:03:13.077 --> 02:03:14.345
But it's his.

02:03:17.548 --> 02:03:19.084
What about you, Thomas?

02:03:20.385 --> 02:03:22.818
What do you have to say?

02:03:22.820 --> 02:03:25.791
Don't you have enough blood
on your hands already?

02:03:27.023 --> 02:03:29.357
You might not have been
able to shoot her.

02:03:29.359 --> 02:03:31.129
But I can.

02:03:34.732 --> 02:03:37.002
Okay. Fine.

02:03:37.501 --> 02:03:38.633
Have it your way.

02:03:40.104 --> 02:03:41.236
Janson.

02:03:46.810 --> 02:03:48.380
Missed, you little shit.

02:03:49.346 --> 02:03:50.348
Did I?

02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:58.089
Oh, shit.

02:04:06.529 --> 02:04:08.463
Come on. We need to go.

02:04:17.275 --> 02:04:19.743
This way. Here.

02:04:29.687 --> 02:04:31.089
Come on.

02:04:55.479 --> 02:04:56.715
Come on.

02:05:40.224 --> 02:05:41.493
I'm sorry.

02:05:43.193 --> 02:05:44.461
I tried.

02:05:49.265 --> 02:05:50.501
I know.

02:06:10.487 --> 02:06:12.288
I think I got him.

02:06:12.290 --> 02:06:13.722
Yeah, that's him.
I'll get the hatch.

02:06:13.724 --> 02:06:14.789
All right, I got him,
I got him.

02:06:14.791 --> 02:06:15.993
Let's go, let's go.

02:06:17.693 --> 02:06:19.163
Come on.

02:06:32.577 --> 02:06:33.978
No!

02:06:37.947 --> 02:06:40.217
I can't get any closer.

02:06:44.889 --> 02:06:46.090
Thomas!

02:06:48.358 --> 02:06:49.459
Now!

02:07:00.804 --> 02:07:02.272
Come on, come on, come on.

02:07:03.907 --> 02:07:06.674
- Come on!
- Come on, Thomas!

02:07:06.676 --> 02:07:08.478
Give me your hand!

02:07:08.946 --> 02:07:10.849
Get closer!

02:07:11.581 --> 02:07:12.616
Jump!

02:07:14.652 --> 02:07:15.854
Lower!

02:07:19.223 --> 02:07:20.655
No!

02:07:20.657 --> 02:07:22.259
You gotta get closer.

02:07:36.439 --> 02:07:37.608
Come on!

02:07:38.775 --> 02:07:40.008
Yeah!

02:07:40.010 --> 02:07:42.013
- Come on, reach! Come on!
- Reach!

02:07:45.581 --> 02:07:46.916
- Pull him up!
- Pull!

02:07:48.585 --> 02:07:49.620
Come on!

02:07:50.452 --> 02:07:51.455
Come on!

02:07:57.727 --> 02:07:59.230
Teresa!

02:08:15.379 --> 02:08:16.648
No!

02:12:00.135 --> 02:12:02.272
<i>We have come
a long way together.</i>

02:12:03.406 --> 02:12:06.740
So many have sacrificed
so much

02:12:06.742 --> 02:12:08.611
to make this place possible.

02:12:09.978 --> 02:12:11.481
Your friends

02:12:12.982 --> 02:12:14.183
and your family.

02:12:16.486 --> 02:12:20.087
So here's to the ones
who couldn't be here.

02:12:20.089 --> 02:12:21.825
Here's to the friends we lost.

02:12:24.626 --> 02:12:27.763
This place is for you.
It's for all of us.

02:12:28.932 --> 02:12:30.500
But this,

02:12:31.334 --> 02:12:33.269
this is for them.

02:12:34.470 --> 02:12:37.874
So, in your own time,
in your own way,

02:12:39.442 --> 02:12:41.345
come make your peace.

02:12:43.479 --> 02:12:45.780
And welcome to the Safe Haven.

02:12:45.782 --> 02:12:47.982
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

02:13:04.099 --> 02:13:05.434
You all want some food?

02:13:09.638 --> 02:13:11.908
This is gonna be
a good home for us.

02:13:15.878 --> 02:13:16.880
Yeah.

02:13:30.492 --> 02:13:33.229
You had this on you
while you were passed out.

02:13:38.034 --> 02:13:40.438
Figured I'd keep it
safe for ya.

02:13:44.107 --> 02:13:46.009
Thanks, Minho.

02:13:48.010 --> 02:13:49.877
See you out there.

02:13:49.879 --> 02:13:51.615
See ya.

02:14:46.169 --> 02:14:48.101
<i>Dear Thomas...</i>

02:14:48.103 --> 02:14:51.838
<i>This is the first letter
I can remember writing.</i>

02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:55.609
<i>Obviously, I don't know if I
wrote any before the maze.</i>

02:14:55.611 --> 02:15:00.913
<i>But even if it's not my first,
it's likely to be my last.</i>

02:15:00.915 --> 02:15:03.686
<i>I want you to know
that I'm not scared.</i>

02:15:04.620 --> 02:15:06.419
<i>Well, not of dying, anyway.</i>

02:15:06.421 --> 02:15:09.355
<i>It's more forgetting.</i>

02:15:09.357 --> 02:15:11.257
<i>It's losing myself
to this virus.</i>

02:15:11.259 --> 02:15:13.329
<i>That's what scares me.</i>

02:15:16.866 --> 02:15:19.833
<i>So every night I've been
saying their names out loud.</i>

02:15:19.835 --> 02:15:21.135
<i>Alby...</i>

02:15:21.137 --> 02:15:23.106
<i>Winston, Chuck.</i>

02:15:24.639 --> 02:15:26.773
<i>And I just repeat them
over and over,</i>

02:15:26.775 --> 02:15:29.141
<i>like a prayer,</i>

02:15:29.143 --> 02:15:31.080
<i>and it all comes
flooding back.</i>

02:15:34.450 --> 02:15:35.716
<i>Just the little things,
like the way</i>

02:15:35.718 --> 02:15:36.883
<i>the sun used to
hit the Glade</i>

02:15:36.885 --> 02:15:39.086
<i>at that perfect moment
right before</i>

02:15:39.088 --> 02:15:41.488
<i>it slipped beneath the walls.</i>

02:15:41.490 --> 02:15:45.126
<i>And I remember the taste
of Frypan's stew.</i>

02:15:45.128 --> 02:15:47.496
<i>I never thought
I'd miss that stuff so much.</i>

02:15:50.566 --> 02:15:52.699
<i>And I remember you.</i>

02:15:52.701 --> 02:15:55.068
<i>I remember the first time you
came up in the Box.</i>

02:15:55.070 --> 02:15:56.470
<i>Just a scared little Greenie</i>

02:15:56.472 --> 02:15:58.608
<i>who couldn't even remember
his own name.</i>

02:15:59.707 --> 02:16:01.475
<i>But from that moment
you ran into the maze,</i>

02:16:01.477 --> 02:16:03.912
<i>I knew I would
follow you anywhere.</i>

02:16:05.482 --> 02:16:07.050
<i>And I have.</i>

02:16:08.985 --> 02:16:10.853
<i>We all have.</i>

02:16:14.357 --> 02:16:16.556
<i>If I could do it
all over again, I would</i>

02:16:16.558 --> 02:16:21.528
<i>and I wouldn't
change a thing.</i>

02:16:21.530 --> 02:16:24.764
<i>And my hope for you</i>

02:16:24.766 --> 02:16:26.733
<i>is that when you're looking
back years from now,</i>

02:16:26.735 --> 02:16:29.037
<i>you'll be able
to say the same.</i>

02:16:31.874 --> 02:16:35.540
<i>The future's
in your hands now, Tommy.</i>

02:16:35.543 --> 02:16:38.080
<i>And I know you'll find a way
to do what's right.</i>

02:16:39.514 --> 02:16:41.084
<i>You always have.</i>

02:16:43.119 --> 02:16:44.952
<i>Take care of everyone for me.</i>

02:16:46.554 --> 02:16:48.523
<i>And take care of yourself.</i>

02:16:50.392 --> 02:16:52.661
<i>You deserve to be happy.</i>

02:16:56.064 --> 02:16:58.032
<i>Thank you for being my friend.</i>

02:17:01.004 --> 02:17:03.068
<i>Goodbye, mate.</i>

02:17:03.071 --> 02:17:04.106
<i>Newt.</i>
