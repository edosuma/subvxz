00:10.778 --> 00:13.712
Mary:
<i>I still don't like it.</i>

00:13.714 --> 00:16.248
Neither do I,
but it's the only way.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.351
We could talk to him.
He might listen.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.220
He's never gonna listen.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.393
Abe.

00:27.395 --> 00:30.763
If you strike your father with
such force he cannot stand,

00:30.765 --> 00:34.099
- you could injure him far worse...
- I'm not gonna kill him.

00:34.101 --> 00:36.635
And don't think of him
as my father, all right?

00:36.637 --> 00:40.072
He is the man keeping
our son from us.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.808
Abe...

00:42.810 --> 00:44.510
Look, once I get Thomas,

00:44.512 --> 00:46.378
we'll go straight to the cove.

00:46.380 --> 00:49.214
Caleb will be heading
there soon, all right?

00:49.216 --> 00:51.183
<i>( donkey brays )</i>

00:55.723 --> 00:57.656
Simcoe.

00:57.658 --> 01:00.059
Hide the trunk.
Hide the trunk.

01:05.498 --> 01:08.300
- Is Rogers with him?
- No, I don't see him.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.335
<i>Maybe he's dead.</i>

01:12.773 --> 01:14.840
- Captain.
- Good day.

01:14.842 --> 01:17.076
Woodhull.
Mrs. Woodhull.

01:17.078 --> 01:19.445
Did you...
did you get him?

01:19.447 --> 01:21.113
Did you get Rogers?

01:21.115 --> 01:23.348
His capture is imminent.

01:23.350 --> 01:25.284
In the meantime,
you'll be glad to know

01:25.286 --> 01:28.387
we retrieved a piece
of your stolen property.

01:28.389 --> 01:31.523
These are your initials,
are they not?

01:31.525 --> 01:35.127
Would have been polite to warn me
he was armed, don't you agree?

01:35.129 --> 01:37.463
Yeah, I... I'm sorry.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.498
Rogers had just mugged us

01:39.500 --> 01:41.200
and I didn't want
to confuse it by...

01:41.202 --> 01:43.202
Owning a proscribed weapon

01:43.204 --> 01:46.872
that should have been surrendered
to the garrison last May.

01:46.874 --> 01:49.708
- Yeah.
- I understand.

01:49.710 --> 01:52.411
I was confused
by something as well.

01:54.548 --> 01:56.315
<i>Why you?</i>

01:56.317 --> 02:00.886
Of all the people
to rob in Setauket,

02:00.888 --> 02:03.755
why did Robert Rogers

02:03.757 --> 02:06.792
only choose you?

02:06.794 --> 02:08.560
We're all alone out here and...

02:08.562 --> 02:10.562
Please.

02:10.564 --> 02:14.266
I want to hear your husband lie

02:14.268 --> 02:16.902
<i>one last time.</i>

02:19.707 --> 02:21.573
No?
Come.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.609
Captain.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.677
( grunts )

02:26.881 --> 02:29.281
And now for a task long overdue.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.383
- Mary: No. No!
- Wait, wait, wait! You were right.

02:31.385 --> 02:34.386
- Ah, here we go.
- You were right what you said on the road.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.421
- Rogers is Culper.
- Is he now?

02:36.423 --> 02:38.257
- Yes, I've been helping him
for over a year. - Abe!

02:38.259 --> 02:40.259
Ever since the murder
of Captain Joyce.

02:40.261 --> 02:43.462
Oh, yes, I heard about that
during my unfortunate captivity.

02:43.464 --> 02:44.930
They said the drummer did it.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.932
No, Rogers said the drummer did it.
It was Robeson.

02:46.934 --> 02:49.234
John Robeson
was the real killer.

02:49.236 --> 02:51.770
He and Joyce were a pair of mollies.
I'm the one who found out.

02:51.772 --> 02:55.240
And when I went to Rogers and I told
him, he used it against Robeson.

02:55.242 --> 02:57.176
He blackmailed him.
He threatened him.

02:57.178 --> 02:59.511
He forced him to spy and
forced me to watch over him.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.181
Forced you?

03:02.183 --> 03:05.517
All right, he told me that someone
else would be watching me,

03:05.519 --> 03:07.352
that he had watchers
all over Setauket

03:07.354 --> 03:09.388
reporting to him,
giving him shelter.

03:09.390 --> 03:13.425
He said that if I didn't
watch over Robeson,

03:13.427 --> 03:15.928
he would reveal that I had
been with Anna Strong.

03:15.930 --> 03:18.363
That if I ever betrayed him,

03:18.365 --> 03:21.333
the death of my son would be
the last thing that I ever saw.

03:21.335 --> 03:23.268
All right?
That is what he does.

03:23.270 --> 03:26.672
He finds out everything about
you, your secrets and your shame,

03:26.674 --> 03:29.541
and he ties it around your neck
like a noose and he chokes you.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.310
Now I had no other choice.

03:35.883 --> 03:39.551
I thought I had heard your last
lie, but that was quite impressive.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.253
No, I can prove it to you!

03:41.255 --> 03:43.789
I have proof.
I'll show you.

03:45.292 --> 03:47.893
I can prove it to you.

04:22.997 --> 04:25.597
So this was his lair?

04:25.599 --> 04:28.867
Yeah, one of them
as far as I know.

04:30.371 --> 04:33.038
You were supposed to kill him.

04:33.040 --> 04:36.642
You may as well kill me. I am a dead
man now that you've seen this place.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.913
Have Cavil and Pierce
post hunting blinds,

04:41.915 --> 04:44.483
one on the north tree line
and one in the horse stable.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.618
- Yes, sir.
- Don't worry, you'll hardly know they're there.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.854
We can't stay here.
Didn't you hear Abe?

04:48.856 --> 04:51.056
Rogers will come for us
and Thomas, too.

04:51.058 --> 04:54.493
Your son is safe at Whitehall. If you
wish to join him there, you're welcome.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.461
Your husband shall remain here.

04:59.033 --> 05:00.799
As you say,

05:00.801 --> 05:02.367
you're already dead.

05:02.369 --> 05:05.570
But you can still
serve a purpose.

05:05.572 --> 05:07.806
What? No.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.776
Get Thomas, get to the cove.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.511
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.946
Get to Caleb. That's all
you need to think about.

I believe you will find

06:05.733 --> 06:08.633
We'll have a cook, a housemaid,

06:08.635 --> 06:11.970
but unfortunately the other
servants are on leave.

06:11.972 --> 06:14.573
I will make do
just fine, Benedict.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.475
But you shouldn't have to.

06:16.477 --> 06:20.979
Peggy, Congress is withholding
a great sum owed to me.

06:20.981 --> 06:23.014
But once this court-martial
business is settled,

06:23.016 --> 06:26.118
then they will pay me back
in full, I assure you.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.986
And you are certain
you will win?

06:27.988 --> 06:29.788
All I must do
is show them the truth.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.690
That I am loyal to the cause

06:31.692 --> 06:34.693
and not the treasonous villain that
Joseph Reed makes me out to be.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.463
You saw yourself.

06:38.465 --> 06:40.665
I could not do it.

06:40.667 --> 06:44.035
I would no sooner betray my
country than I would you.

06:51.478 --> 06:55.714
I have always seen
the virtue in your candor,

06:55.716 --> 06:57.482
but when you're in trial,

06:57.484 --> 07:00.051
take care that it's not
accompanied by anger.

07:04.825 --> 07:07.492
And instead of saying "I,"

07:07.494 --> 07:11.196
try to say "our country"
whenever you can.

07:11.198 --> 07:13.765
Identify yourself with the army

07:13.767 --> 07:15.033
so that when Reed attacks you,

07:15.035 --> 07:17.502
he's really attacking
America herself.

07:17.504 --> 07:21.173
You make me a better man with
every word that you speak.

07:21.175 --> 07:24.142
My words are only meant to
help you convey your loyalty.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.180
That is what makes the man.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.086
I'm ready, John.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.473
Took quite a lot
to perfect the high roll.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.943
Did I get it right?

08:06.220 --> 08:09.621
You spent so much money
tailoring this dress.

08:12.559 --> 08:15.260
Sure you want me to take it off?

08:16.663 --> 08:18.563
Leave it on.

08:28.509 --> 08:32.010
( breathing heavily )

08:34.280 --> 08:36.214
André:
<i>Abigail.</i>

08:38.184 --> 08:40.085
Abigail.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.120
You were supposed to be halfway
to Philadelphia by now.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.923
I'm sorry. The checkpoint
requires your signature now, sir.

08:44.925 --> 08:47.259
- They sent me back.
- Give me the letter.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.136
- I want to explain.
- There's no need to.

08:58.138 --> 09:01.873
It is unfortunate,
but sometimes my job

09:01.875 --> 09:04.709
requires unorthodox methods
to achieve results.

09:09.316 --> 09:11.883
I think it best
that word of this

09:11.885 --> 09:14.219
does not travel with you.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.158
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

09:20.160 --> 09:22.093
<i>( bird squawking )</i>

09:32.673 --> 09:35.206
Abe's voice: <i>Get to Caleb.
Get to the cove.</i>

09:35.208 --> 09:37.208
<i>That's all you need
to think about.</i>

09:46.987 --> 09:50.255
( screaming )

09:50.257 --> 09:51.856
Whoa.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.360
There in the trees.
It's him.

09:55.362 --> 09:58.063
<i>I saw him!
There!</i>

09:58.065 --> 10:00.198
<i>It's him.
It's Rogers.</i>

10:00.200 --> 10:02.601
There's nothing out there.
She's just jumpy.

10:02.603 --> 10:05.036
No, he saw me and he
hid behind the trees.

10:05.038 --> 10:08.073
I swear it's him. It's Robert Rogers.
He's gonna kill me.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.909
We can't chase every ghost
that frightens you, ma'am.

10:10.911 --> 10:15.814
Boone, take Fitch and Odell
to search the woods.

10:15.816 --> 10:20.218
All the way down to Frog's Cove.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.354
Mary: <i>It was Rogers.
I saw him.</i>

10:22.356 --> 10:25.023
He looked at me. I saw his
horrible, bearded face.

10:25.025 --> 10:28.093
Simcoe: <i>If he's there,
my men will find him.</i>

10:28.095 --> 10:31.896
In the meantime, you may ride with
me if it makes you feel safer.

10:40.707 --> 10:43.308
Stay close.
( clicks tongue )

10:57.691 --> 10:59.958
( chatter )

11:04.865 --> 11:08.099
Come on. Come on.
Move it.

11:09.936 --> 11:11.770
<i>( horse whinnies )</i>

11:13.140 --> 11:15.073
Have you told him yet?

11:17.244 --> 11:19.144
You have to tell him.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.379
Better to offer no excuse
than a bad one.

11:21.381 --> 11:24.215
But it's not an excuse.

11:24.217 --> 11:25.450
It's truth.
He needs to hear it.

11:25.452 --> 11:28.420
I need answers before
I can answer to him.

11:28.422 --> 11:30.955
And if I wait until Abe returns,

11:30.957 --> 11:32.424
then I can make a full report

11:32.426 --> 11:35.760
on exactly how this ring
has dissolved.

11:35.762 --> 11:39.297
But until that happy day, I
have other duties to attend to.

11:39.299 --> 11:42.934
But you're going to walk into General
Washington's tent this day or the next

11:42.936 --> 11:45.370
and you don't want to explain
what took you so long.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.108
Major.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.010
A gang of Tories was
just brought into camp.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.745
- What, militia?
- Partisans.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.180
They're in the stockade
ready for interrogation.

11:55.182 --> 11:57.315
Thank you.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.288
Other duties.

12:05.859 --> 12:08.460
<i>( distant chatter )</i>

12:08.462 --> 12:10.862
They ambushed a patrol
about 10 miles south,

12:10.864 --> 12:13.431
then fled when
reinforcements came.

12:13.433 --> 12:16.234
Our men pursued them to a farmhouse
where they made a stand.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.069
We lost one man, another's
with the chaplain.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.205
10 miles south, you said?
Where exactly?

12:20.207 --> 12:21.873
<i>Franklin Township.</i>

12:25.345 --> 12:27.278
Randall: <i>Eight men
and one strumpet.</i>

12:29.116 --> 12:30.982
<i>Wasn't sure what to do with her.</i>

12:36.923 --> 12:39.457
Right, well, clear the barn out.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.760
Separate the prisoners. I'll
question them one by one.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.800
<i>( insects chirping )</i>

12:51.838 --> 12:54.172
<i>( bird cawing )</i>

13:06.953 --> 13:09.187
<i>( branches snapping )</i>

13:13.193 --> 13:15.160
<i>( gunshot )</i>

13:22.969 --> 13:25.570
She was right.
It's Rogers.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.808
- Report to the captain.
- Aye.

13:29.810 --> 13:31.376
Odell, you're with me.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.854
You need
a little warm-up?

13:44.324 --> 13:45.557
You sure?

13:45.559 --> 13:47.325
These nights can get
pretty cold.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.509
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

14:04.511 --> 14:07.045
I have spoken to the soldiers

14:07.047 --> 14:10.281
involved in the exchange.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.250
They all say
that they saw a woman

14:12.252 --> 14:14.552
from the window firing
along with the rest.

14:14.554 --> 14:17.021
It was my home.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.090
Have I not the right
to defend it?

14:19.092 --> 14:21.893
So you were protecting
these Tories, then?

14:21.895 --> 14:23.261
Just as I did with you.

14:24.898 --> 14:27.165
Sarah...

14:27.167 --> 14:30.201
just give me something.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.071
Anything that I can
use to help you.

14:33.073 --> 14:36.574
All right? Were...
were you pressured?

14:36.576 --> 14:39.077
Did you aid these men
under some sort of threat?

14:39.079 --> 14:41.145
I didn't aid anything.

14:41.147 --> 14:43.114
I helped plan the ambush.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.984
I led them back to my house
when our plan went wrong.

14:48.088 --> 14:50.555
How long had...

14:50.557 --> 14:53.524
exactly how long have you
been a part of this?

14:53.526 --> 14:56.928
Since I learned I couldn't
stay out of this war.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.631
Since the day it came
to my doorstep

14:59.633 --> 15:03.301
and into my home.

15:03.303 --> 15:05.637
But that's not what you wanted
to hear, though, is it?

15:07.607 --> 15:10.041
I wanted to hear the truth.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.311
And I...

15:15.515 --> 15:19.117
and I wanted to thank you.

15:19.119 --> 15:22.453
Properly thank you
for what you did.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.693
You want to thank me,
Major Tallmadge?

15:30.363 --> 15:33.698
Then return the favor
and get me out of here.

15:37.671 --> 15:41.339
<i>( men chatting )</i>

15:41.341 --> 15:44.475
Mary, might we have
a word in private?

15:44.477 --> 15:46.511
No.

15:46.513 --> 15:49.547
I don't know what vapors have gotten
hold of you, but this is important.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.215
Falkoff: <i>He's come back?
It doesn't make sense.</i>

15:51.217 --> 15:53.151
<i>We chased Rogers
down to Oyster Bay.</i>

15:53.153 --> 15:55.720
What could possibly be in Setauket
to warrant the risk of returning?

15:55.722 --> 15:57.555
Falkoff has a point,
Mrs. Woodhull.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.958
I know what I saw.

16:01.661 --> 16:05.363
- <i>( door opens )</i>
- Captain! Captain!

16:05.365 --> 16:07.999
We spotted him by the water.

16:08.001 --> 16:09.600
Robert Rogers.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.569
Are you certain?

16:11.571 --> 16:14.439
He shot at us
and we found his boat.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.040
The others are after him now.

16:16.042 --> 16:18.109
I told you
that he was out there.

16:18.111 --> 16:20.545
You need to bring my husband
here where it's safe.

16:20.547 --> 16:23.414
So he traveled by water.

16:23.416 --> 16:26.050
That's how he evaded us
at Oyster Bay.

16:26.052 --> 16:29.053
Well, he's lost his keel now.

16:29.055 --> 16:31.155
Deploy all the men
to search Setauket.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.657
And the coves.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.759
And have them stay
in teams of four this time.

16:34.761 --> 16:37.228
Are you not concerned you may
be leaving us unprotected?

16:37.230 --> 16:40.098
I'll remain for your protection.
That's more than enough.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.103
Post four reserves
on the perimeter.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.171
Well-hidden and eyes out.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.273
He's returned for me.

16:56.383 --> 16:59.183
( men chatting )

17:19.539 --> 17:22.205
Man:
<i>Mr. Reed, your witness.</i>

17:22.208 --> 17:24.509
Reed: <i>What was the
character of this man</i>

17:24.511 --> 17:28.413
<i>whose schooner General Arnold
permitted to port in Philadelphia?</i>

17:28.415 --> 17:31.749
Captain Shewell was generally
regarded as a Tory.

17:31.751 --> 17:35.620
He even was directed
by the commander-in-chief

17:35.622 --> 17:39.223
to leave the army encampment
on pain of imprisonment.

17:39.225 --> 17:43.261
For a treacherous captain who was
ordered to leave Patriot territory

17:43.263 --> 17:45.596
<i>by General Washington himself.</i>

17:45.598 --> 17:47.298
Yes.

17:47.300 --> 17:51.235
For a profit in his
favor, I should add.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.371
Secretary Matlack,

17:54.507 --> 17:56.574
to your knowledge,

17:56.576 --> 17:59.811
was I aware of Captain
Shewell's reputation

17:59.813 --> 18:01.145
when I granted him passage?

18:01.147 --> 18:03.581
Everyone was aware,

18:03.583 --> 18:07.418
especially after news of General
Washington's order spread through the city.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.854
Yes, you said that.

18:09.856 --> 18:13.191
And do you know where I was when
this news came to Philadelphia?

18:13.193 --> 18:15.626
- Up north.
- With the army.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.462
I was off to battle.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.764
Can you see, then,
how these petty issues

18:19.766 --> 18:23.267
of whom to trade with might
not have crossed my mind?

18:23.269 --> 18:25.319
Maybe.

18:25.320 --> 18:27.370
But I heard profits
were made in your favor.

18:27.373 --> 18:29.674
But this is not a matter
of profit sharing.

18:29.676 --> 18:32.543
It is a matter
of granting a captain

18:32.545 --> 18:35.580
of accused loyalism
access to our ports.

18:35.582 --> 18:38.416
Speaking of which,
have you understood

18:38.418 --> 18:40.585
that upon several alarms
this past year,

18:40.587 --> 18:45.189
Captain Shewell turned out with the
Continental militia and did duty with them?

18:45.191 --> 18:47.492
I know nothing of that matter.

18:47.494 --> 18:50.795
Well, I suppose
that's excusable, Secretary.

18:50.797 --> 18:54.032
In times of war,

18:54.033 --> 18:57.268
we must not always hold men responsible
for what they are not aware of.

18:57.270 --> 19:03.341
( men murmuring )

19:04.611 --> 19:07.645
Mary: While the squash is
boiling, stew the apples tender.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.715
I'll come back
to add the dry bread.

19:10.717 --> 19:13.651
You're preparing a meal now?

19:13.653 --> 19:15.620
Why are you pretending
there's nothing wrong

19:15.622 --> 19:17.588
- when everything is?
- Excuse me.

19:17.590 --> 19:20.658
The captain is in a more
dangerous season than you know.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.628
- I know well enough.
- He threatened your son.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.632
- When?
- Just last week.

19:27.634 --> 19:30.268
Now, Thomas is with Aberdeen.

19:30.270 --> 19:33.838
I want you to take him and
flee at your first chance.

19:33.840 --> 19:39.510
I know the tale that you and Abe
spun about Rogers is a lie.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.846
Then you know if I flee with
Thomas, Abe will be exposed.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.681
The truth will come
to light on its own.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.717
And when it does, you do not
want Thomas anywhere near here.

19:46.719 --> 19:49.654
You may be able to stand by and
watch Abe's demise, but I cannot.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.956
Simcoe is not a problem
that will go away.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.958
- Unless he does.
- What do you mean by that?

19:53.960 --> 19:55.826
- <i>( door opens )</i>
- What are you planning to do?

19:55.828 --> 19:59.430
Then widen the search. Captain
wants to keep the old man running.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.499
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Aye, sir.</i>

20:10.777 --> 20:13.244
<i>( distant men chattering )</i>

20:30.730 --> 20:33.397
You will report only
what you come upon naturally

20:33.399 --> 20:34.999
and only when it's safe.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.735
We have many ways of keeping
our correspondence secret.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.057
You want me to spy
on my neighbors?

20:43.009 --> 20:46.310
Even though it was you who
lied to me about who you were,

20:46.312 --> 20:47.878
you still don't know who I am.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.581
Look, Sarah, you want out of
here, this is how you get out.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.383
By turning against my own?

20:52.385 --> 20:54.552
- This is the favor you return?
- Then lie.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.022
All right?
Just sign it.

20:58.024 --> 21:00.424
And then once you're gone,
you do as you will.

21:00.426 --> 21:03.027
Just know I won't be able
to protect you a second time.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.732
And when the war is over

21:07.734 --> 21:10.334
and this letter is
discovered, what then?

21:10.336 --> 21:12.036
Am I to hang beside you
from the gallows?

21:12.038 --> 21:14.572
Sarah, don't you see
by letting you go like this,

21:14.574 --> 21:16.707
I'm all but committing treason?

21:19.712 --> 21:21.545
I know.

21:25.451 --> 21:28.386
But I was the one
who chose to fight.

21:28.388 --> 21:32.690
I chose because I was ready
to die for my beliefs.

21:32.692 --> 21:35.012
But I'm not ready
to die for yours.

21:37.930 --> 21:43.301
Philomena: <i>♪ And I will
love you all the days ♪</i>

21:43.303 --> 21:47.705
<i>♪ In the night
would kiss and play ♪</i>

21:47.707 --> 21:51.909
<i>♪ If with me
you fondly stray ♪</i>

21:51.911 --> 21:55.946
<i>♪ Over the hills
and far away. ♪</i>

21:55.948 --> 21:58.716
John.

21:58.718 --> 22:00.051
How did you get in here?

22:00.053 --> 22:02.053
Oh, Cicero, is it?

22:02.055 --> 22:03.988
( chuckles )

22:03.990 --> 22:08.059
♪ If with me
you'll fondly stray ♪

22:08.061 --> 22:10.328
♪ Over the hills and... ♪

22:10.330 --> 22:12.730
This is not your cup, Philomena.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.832
This is not your home.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.600
I know.

22:18.571 --> 22:21.706
I thought I'd surprise you.

22:21.708 --> 22:26.977
But I can always delay
my arrivals, as you know.

22:26.979 --> 22:29.080
Perhaps you should
delay indefinitely.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.516
Excuse me?

22:33.720 --> 22:37.054
We... this has come
to its end.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.994
If you need me to be
the lady from the sketch...

22:43.996 --> 22:46.364
You could never be her.

22:46.366 --> 22:48.766
I was a fool
to ever think you could.

22:59.612 --> 23:02.012
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

23:02.014 --> 23:04.648
<i>( fire crackling )</i>

23:14.627 --> 23:16.761
He overestimates me.

23:16.763 --> 23:20.164
Regaining Arnold's interest
in resuming correspondence

23:20.166 --> 23:23.167
may be far past my reach.

23:23.169 --> 23:27.405
Tell me, how does the good
major pass his days now?

23:27.407 --> 23:29.707
He keeps busy

23:29.709 --> 23:31.642
with his responsibilities.

23:31.644 --> 23:35.679
No hobbies?
Amusements?

23:35.681 --> 23:38.449
He plays on his violin still.

23:38.451 --> 23:41.152
Does he wake you and your son
up with his early practice?

23:41.154 --> 23:43.788
( laughs )
We don't mind.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.790
- I minded.
- ( laughs )

23:45.792 --> 23:49.527
And I assume he still keeps
relations with Philomena Cheer.

23:53.433 --> 23:55.499
It's true, then?

23:55.501 --> 23:56.734
It's not what it seems.

23:56.736 --> 23:59.170
How?
How is it not?

23:59.172 --> 24:02.573
His profession
can sometimes require him

24:02.575 --> 24:04.842
to steer certain people
in ways that are unorthodox.

24:04.844 --> 24:07.878
- As he did with me.
- No. No.

24:07.880 --> 24:10.881
He writes to me, but all
he really wants is Arnold.

24:10.883 --> 24:13.617
Miss Peggy, he loves you.

24:15.087 --> 24:17.121
Please leave, Abigail.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.825
Please.

24:33.706 --> 24:36.774
- <i>( door opens )</i>
- ( crying )

24:36.776 --> 24:39.510
<i>( door closes )</i>

24:50.723 --> 24:53.190
This charge is about
giving menial offices

24:53.192 --> 24:55.693
to a freeman of the militia.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.261
Menial offices?

24:57.263 --> 25:00.130
We order men to put their
heads in front of cannons,

25:00.132 --> 25:02.166
yet God forbid we ask one
to fetch a barber.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.767
( men chuckling )

25:03.769 --> 25:06.604
It was only to point out
a pattern of misconduct.

25:06.606 --> 25:08.506
Such as with the military
wagons you used...

25:08.508 --> 25:11.909
With my own quid,
Mr. Reed.

25:11.911 --> 25:15.613
Yes, they were military,
but they were not in use.

25:15.615 --> 25:17.882
You see, this is
a civilian's vendetta.

25:17.884 --> 25:20.784
<i>Arguably jealous of the
army's brave accomplishments.</i>

25:20.786 --> 25:23.521
He and his council have harassed
the military establishment

25:23.523 --> 25:25.022
in Philadelphia
ever since we took it back.

25:25.024 --> 25:28.659
This is not about the army.
This is about you.

25:28.661 --> 25:31.295
I was one of the first
who appeared in the field.

25:31.297 --> 25:34.665
And from that time to the present hour,
I have not abandoned her service.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.834
And now I am faced with this.

25:36.836 --> 25:39.737
This vile prostitution of power.

25:39.739 --> 25:42.139
Such instances of glaring
tyranny and injustice,

25:42.141 --> 25:45.142
I believe, are unprecedented in
the annals of any free people.

25:47.280 --> 25:50.781
Gentlemen, I ask you,

25:50.783 --> 25:54.718
is this the nation that these
free states are fighting for?

26:02.295 --> 26:04.228
Knox: <i>Of the second
and third charge,</i>

26:04.230 --> 26:08.766
the court does fully acquit
Major General Arnold.

26:08.768 --> 26:11.936
With respect to the first
and last charges,

26:11.938 --> 26:14.805
the court has determined to
sentence Major General Arnold

26:14.807 --> 26:18.642
a reprimand from His Excellency,
the commander-in-chief.

26:18.644 --> 26:21.679
A reprimand?
Only a reprimand?

26:21.681 --> 26:23.914
This court-martial
is adjourned.

26:23.916 --> 26:27.151
- <i>( gavel bangs )</i>
- ( men murmuring )

26:40.666 --> 26:43.067
<i>( insects chirping )</i>

27:01.120 --> 27:03.253
<i>( owl hooting )</i>

27:06.959 --> 27:08.859
( hooting )

27:18.270 --> 27:21.138
( rustling )

27:23.142 --> 27:25.175
Shite.

27:31.017 --> 27:32.650
( hammer clicks )

27:35.921 --> 27:37.921
- ( gunshot )
- ( grunts )

27:45.698 --> 27:47.665
( groaning )

27:49.301 --> 27:50.834
( gunshot )

28:03.315 --> 28:05.416
( gunshot )

28:11.123 --> 28:13.724
Cavil, that you?

28:13.726 --> 28:15.759
- Boone?
- Come here.

28:31.377 --> 28:34.244
- What the hell?
- I bought us two minutes. We got to go.

28:34.246 --> 28:36.146
- Where's Mary? What's going on?
- Mary?

28:36.148 --> 28:38.315
- Did you leave them down at the cove?
- The cove?

28:38.317 --> 28:39.817
- Yeah.
- What? No.

28:39.819 --> 28:41.952
The only thing I left
at the cove was my boat.

28:41.954 --> 28:43.754
The Rangers were there.
They were ready.

28:43.756 --> 28:44.922
They knew I was coming, right?

28:44.924 --> 28:46.457
And they said
something about Rogers.

28:46.459 --> 28:48.859
No, I got it in their minds
that he's here in Setauket.

28:48.861 --> 28:51.581
They couldn't have known that you
were down at the cove. No one knew.

28:52.798 --> 28:54.898
Except Mary.

28:59.138 --> 29:00.738
You damn near
blew our heads off.

29:00.740 --> 29:03.474
It's Rogers. I knew
this was a bad idea.

29:03.476 --> 29:05.109
Shh, do you hear that?

29:05.111 --> 29:08.045
<i>( owl hooting )</i>

29:08.047 --> 29:10.514
It's him. We're good
as gudgeons out here

29:10.516 --> 29:12.282
if we don't get someplace safe.

29:12.284 --> 29:13.917
Cabin.

29:18.124 --> 29:20.124
Woody, they're coming.
We've got to go now.

29:20.126 --> 29:22.259
- Simcoe has made her talk.
- What? We got to go.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.527
No, you have
to get to Whitehall.

29:23.529 --> 29:25.162
You got to check
on Mary and Thomas.

29:25.164 --> 29:26.964
- Whitehall?
- Yes.

29:29.902 --> 29:31.435
- Go. Hurry.
- All right.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.437
- Good luck.
- Thank you. Go.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.044
What the hell
is going on out there?

29:41.046 --> 29:42.346
The old bear's
come for your head.

29:42.348 --> 29:44.148
I told you.
He's everywhere.

29:44.150 --> 29:46.383
We're gonna do him a little
favor if you don't shut up.

29:46.385 --> 29:49.253
Now sit down. We're gonna
hunker here awhile.

30:15.314 --> 30:18.482
I've been at this post awhile.

30:18.484 --> 30:21.001
You may find it hard to believe,

30:21.002 --> 30:23.802
but Major Tallmadge isn't the only
one who can offer special treatment.

30:25.925 --> 30:29.526
It's a blessing
being a lady prisoner.

30:31.263 --> 30:33.330
You're drunk.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.732
I don't need your kindness.

30:36.936 --> 30:40.270
Don't worry. My kindness
doesn't require much.

30:47.446 --> 30:49.146
Hey.

30:57.890 --> 31:01.525
( groaning )

31:11.003 --> 31:12.502
( gunshot echoes )

31:12.504 --> 31:14.504
<i>( overlapping voices )
We're under attack!</i>

31:14.506 --> 31:17.207
<i>- Firearms ready!
- It came from over there!</i>

31:17.209 --> 31:19.009
You two, check
the other prisoners.

31:19.011 --> 31:20.911
- Aye, sir.
- Yes, sir.

31:25.084 --> 31:26.950
Oh, God.

31:26.952 --> 31:29.920
What... what happened?
What happened?!

31:29.922 --> 31:31.321
She tried to escape.

31:32.524 --> 31:34.291
And so you shot her?

31:36.996 --> 31:39.029
Your face.

31:41.433 --> 31:43.533
- I can explain...
- ( grunts )

31:50.042 --> 31:52.276
- Sir!
- ( grunting )

31:52.278 --> 31:54.011
- Leave him!
- Get him off him now!

31:54.013 --> 31:56.280
( shouts )

32:07.259 --> 32:09.993
<i>- ( crickets chirping )
- ( owl hooting )</i>

32:17.002 --> 32:19.169
( clock ticking )

32:19.171 --> 32:21.038
Mary:
<i>Captain Simcoe.</i>

32:28.447 --> 32:31.181
I wanted to say I'm sorry for
not coming forward sooner

32:31.183 --> 32:33.717
about Robert Rogers.

32:33.719 --> 32:36.520
We were living in fear and that
led to regrettable choices.

32:36.522 --> 32:39.089
And since it is to be
a long night for you,

32:39.091 --> 32:42.426
I've made you some of my winter
squash pie and collops of rabbit.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.329
Thank you.

32:47.666 --> 32:49.733
You were able to spot
Rogers in the wood

32:49.735 --> 32:53.270
when my trained
militia could not.

32:53.272 --> 32:55.639
Perhaps you'd wish to join me.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.307
I must decline.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.409
I've just had a warm bath
made upstairs.

33:03.115 --> 33:04.681
Very well.

33:25.337 --> 33:28.338
<i>( birds calling )</i>

33:31.310 --> 33:33.443
<i>( distant dog barking )</i>

34:11.516 --> 34:13.183
( gasps )

35:07.473 --> 35:09.272
( gunshot )

35:15.314 --> 35:17.781
( panting )

35:17.783 --> 35:19.583
( wind whistling )

35:19.585 --> 35:22.752
Ranger: <i>Over there!
By the house!</i>

35:22.754 --> 35:25.455
<i>( Rangers shouting )</i>

35:30.229 --> 35:31.761
Fitch:
<i>It came from the front.</i>

35:31.763 --> 35:33.697
<i>This way.</i>

35:36.768 --> 35:39.302
- Hold it!
- It's Rogers. He's here.

35:39.304 --> 35:40.871
- He's here.
- Mrs. Woodhull.

35:40.873 --> 35:43.373
Come on, we need to get you inside now.
Come on, come on.

35:43.375 --> 35:45.208
- Ma'am, come on. Please.
- Wait, wait.

35:46.879 --> 35:49.346
- Come on. Please, come on.
- No, stop. Stop it!

35:49.348 --> 35:51.515
- No! No, let me go!
- What are you doing out here?

35:51.517 --> 35:53.783
- ( grunts )
- ( gurgling )

35:55.354 --> 35:57.454
( shrieks )

36:17.476 --> 36:20.343
<i>( high-pitched ringing )</i>

36:34.893 --> 36:37.961
Ranger: <i>You, come with me.
You, take the back.</i>

36:37.963 --> 36:39.723
Falkoff:
<i>Where's Fitch?</i>

36:41.466 --> 36:43.733
Sir, there was a...

36:44.770 --> 36:45.936
a gunshot.

36:45.938 --> 36:48.438
Where is he?!

36:48.440 --> 36:50.874
Sir, sir!

36:50.876 --> 36:52.609
They got Fitch.

36:53.812 --> 36:55.278
No, no.

37:07.226 --> 37:09.426
How did he get behind the lines?

37:09.428 --> 37:12.362
Fall back to the house, now!

37:13.865 --> 37:16.933
She's got them running
around in circles.

37:23.809 --> 37:25.976
- Let's look in the back.
- How about the cellar?

37:25.978 --> 37:28.812
- Nothing.
- You two, with me.

37:34.987 --> 37:36.519
<i>( door slams )</i>

37:45.797 --> 37:48.031
( breathing heavily )

37:48.033 --> 37:51.301
( sounds echoing )

38:02.047 --> 38:04.814
Sorry to alarm you, but I wanted
to make sure you were safe.

38:07.052 --> 38:11.421
I'm... I'm just
having a bath.

38:11.423 --> 38:13.923
Aren't you going to ask me
if I'm all right?

38:17.996 --> 38:20.297
<i>( gunshot )</i>

38:25.971 --> 38:29.539
You want Rogers?
I'll give you Rogers.

38:29.541 --> 38:31.074
- Ranger: The tree line!
- Ranger #2: Over there!

38:31.076 --> 38:33.476
- Loose your guns!
- ( gunshot )

38:33.478 --> 38:36.813
<i>- Who is that?
- Spread out!</i>

38:36.815 --> 38:39.849
( gasping )

38:39.851 --> 38:42.886
( sobbing )

38:45.590 --> 38:47.857
<i>( chatter )</i>

38:54.433 --> 38:55.932
Thank you, Robert.

38:55.934 --> 38:58.568
Henry, you can count
on the Virginia militia.

38:58.570 --> 39:01.037
Remember that.

39:01.039 --> 39:02.939
General.

39:12.884 --> 39:16.086
You had it printed?
The entire court record?

39:16.088 --> 39:17.620
In English and French.

39:17.622 --> 39:19.889
To be distributed throughout
America and Europe.

39:19.891 --> 39:21.624
At quite the expense,
I'd imagine.

39:21.626 --> 39:24.627
I want the world to know
of my exoneration.

39:24.629 --> 39:26.930
And that justice
is valued in this army.

39:26.932 --> 39:29.499
Well, you certainly earned it.

39:29.501 --> 39:31.368
Congratulations, sir.

39:31.370 --> 39:34.571
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have
other matters to attend to.

39:34.573 --> 39:37.741
A row between two of our officers
over prisoner treatment or some such.

39:37.743 --> 39:41.544
Henry, wait.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.747
General, I, um...

39:43.749 --> 39:46.616
I plan to return
to Philadelphia today,

39:46.618 --> 39:50.053
but not before settling the
matter of my reimbursement.

39:50.055 --> 39:51.888
Reimbursement?

39:51.890 --> 39:54.524
Four years' back pay.

39:54.526 --> 39:56.926
And debts from
my Canada expeditions.

39:56.928 --> 40:00.764
As you say, this was printed
at quite the expense.

40:00.766 --> 40:03.166
Benedict, Congress is bankrupt.

40:03.168 --> 40:05.802
<i>I mean, the damn
counterfeiters saw to that.</i>

40:05.804 --> 40:08.671
<i>I've been going without.
We've all been going without.</i>

40:08.673 --> 40:11.441
- Yes, but I...
- Surely you didn't think the court-martial

40:11.443 --> 40:13.042
was holding back your money.

40:13.044 --> 40:15.178
<i>This was about
defending your honor.</i>

40:15.180 --> 40:17.514
<i>And you did that, sir.</i>

40:17.516 --> 40:20.016
That in the end will hold
more weight than coin.

40:48.547 --> 40:50.613
<i>you were marvelous.</i>

40:53.552 --> 40:57.854
Your absence these past days
has given me a realization.

40:57.856 --> 41:00.790
You have your fortune

41:00.792 --> 41:03.760

41:17.175 --> 41:19.809

41:22.747 --> 41:24.867
Nothing could make me happier.
