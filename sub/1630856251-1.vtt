04:56.738 --> 05:07.399
THE DELINQUENTS

05:36.467 --> 05:41.338
PART ONE

06:49.842 --> 06:50.998
Twenty,

06:52.926 --> 06:54.357
twenty,

06:55.259 --> 06:56.974
twenty, twenty,

06:58.301 --> 06:59.334
thirty,

07:00.717 --> 07:01.920
sixty.

07:03.467 --> 07:04.543
Twenty.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.826
Done.

07:50.676 --> 07:52.277
Six hundred.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.500
What do you have there?

08:31.676 --> 08:33.527
I have to give you...

08:35.759 --> 08:37.691
some statements for Del Toro.

08:40.301 --> 08:43.105
Box 2: $485,225.

08:51.410 --> 08:52.410
Beardy.

08:55.634 --> 08:58.051
Box 4: $511,511.

08:59.138 --> 09:00.857
Del Toro, how do you do?

09:00.857 --> 09:02.096
Marianela.

09:02.096 --> 09:03.146
Del Toro.

09:04.342 --> 09:06.276
- Go on, Morán.
- How do you do?

09:06.551 --> 09:08.259
- Isnardi.
- Del Toro.

09:08.426 --> 09:10.555
- Ivanchuk.
- Del Toro, how do you do?

09:34.717 --> 09:35.926
Anything wrong?

09:36.576 --> 09:37.576
Román!

09:41.009 --> 09:42.424
I don't get this.

09:42.424 --> 09:44.042
- Hi.
- How do you do?

09:44.042 --> 09:48.146
- Let's see...
- Maybe the name is wrong,

09:49.235 --> 09:51.110
because it matches the signature of...

09:51.654 --> 09:53.363
of another client. Look!

09:54.301 --> 09:56.465
Just a second, ma'am. Thank you.

10:00.462 --> 10:01.712
Marianela...

10:02.475 --> 10:04.850
A client brought in this check.

10:05.102 --> 10:06.519
Isnardi, excuse me...

10:07.051 --> 10:11.759
Send me the table for these,
there's a problem with boxes 3 and 4.

10:12.004 --> 10:13.199
They don't match?

10:13.199 --> 10:15.667
Three and four don't match,
there's an error.

10:24.220 --> 10:26.553
You'll speak to
the assistant manager, ma'am.

10:26.553 --> 10:28.168
No, you're welcome.

10:28.318 --> 10:29.649
Here she comes.

10:30.217 --> 10:32.092
- Hello.
- How are you? How do you do?

10:32.092 --> 10:33.476
All good, my dear, all good.

10:33.886 --> 10:35.751
- I'm glad.
- Well...

10:36.113 --> 10:37.625
Here's the question...

10:37.625 --> 10:39.204
Do you need me at all?

10:39.379 --> 10:41.462
No, you go, no problem.
Thank you.

10:42.440 --> 10:43.606
This signature...

10:43.926 --> 10:46.730
are we completely sure it is yours?

10:47.100 --> 10:48.123
Yes.

10:48.233 --> 10:49.566
Yes, absolutely.

10:49.703 --> 10:51.536
I don't need my glasses.

10:52.130 --> 10:54.505
- I know it by heart.
- Right.

10:54.657 --> 10:57.365
And you don't have, maybe,
another one?

10:57.761 --> 10:59.261
No, no, just that one,

10:59.488 --> 11:00.583
for years,

11:00.583 --> 11:03.033
I've been signing
like this for years.

11:03.033 --> 11:05.626
Could you wait here for a short while?

11:05.626 --> 11:06.710
Where?

11:06.710 --> 11:08.959
- Sit wherever you like.
- Alright.

11:08.959 --> 11:11.701
Sit down here, and I'll show you in.

11:11.904 --> 11:12.917
Check this out.

11:13.256 --> 11:15.895
The bank's signature registry

11:16.071 --> 11:19.654
shows these two
identical signatures, here.

11:19.774 --> 11:21.516
- Yes.
- Under the name...

11:21.892 --> 11:23.417
José Marzio Crivilone.

11:23.740 --> 11:26.643
The signature is identical
and she endorsed the check,

11:26.643 --> 11:28.318
and it's the same here.

11:33.118 --> 11:34.649
It is the same signature.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.402
Is he still a client?

11:37.402 --> 11:38.453
Yes.

11:39.207 --> 11:40.251
Did you call him?

11:40.638 --> 11:41.638
No.

11:43.076 --> 11:44.201
Call him.

11:57.498 --> 12:01.990
Hi, this is a message
for José Marzio Crivilone.

12:01.990 --> 12:04.666
I'm calling you from the
Social Cooperative Bank,

12:04.942 --> 12:08.148
please get in touch with us urgently.

12:08.148 --> 12:10.313
My name is Marianela Barbaj,

12:10.313 --> 12:14.985
and the bank's number is
4361-7252,

12:14.985 --> 12:16.557
extension 748.

12:16.797 --> 12:18.194
Thank you very much.

12:25.965 --> 12:27.001
Incredible!

12:27.713 --> 12:29.288
Let's see...

12:29.288 --> 12:30.906
hand me some paper, please.

12:31.519 --> 12:33.701
Please, madam, be so kind,

12:33.701 --> 12:35.177
and sign for me here, please.

12:35.177 --> 12:36.387
Sure.

12:47.771 --> 12:48.896
They are identical.

12:48.896 --> 12:52.220
- Sure, that is my signature.
- No, madam.

12:53.173 --> 12:57.474
We won't be able to receive this check
until we clarify the situation.

12:57.665 --> 12:59.474
We have another client,

12:59.634 --> 13:03.217
with the same signature as yours.
Do you understand me?

13:03.217 --> 13:07.905
The bank records show
the signature of this gentleman,

13:08.009 --> 13:09.505
of another client, let's say,

13:09.505 --> 13:11.085
in lieu of yours.

13:11.085 --> 13:12.842
But I don't think it's my problem,

13:12.842 --> 13:15.129
it's yours, because,
in truth,

13:15.342 --> 13:16.812
I've always signed like that.

13:17.233 --> 13:19.172
There are people
with the same handwriting,

13:19.172 --> 13:20.831
others can have the same signature.

13:21.519 --> 13:22.926
But that's nonsense!

13:23.092 --> 13:25.926
Madam, this is
the first time this ever happened.

13:26.092 --> 13:29.301
Some people have the same voice.

13:29.775 --> 13:31.209
What does that have to do with it?

13:34.284 --> 13:35.695
Some people have the same life--

13:35.695 --> 13:37.248
Enough, Marianela.

13:37.248 --> 13:38.458
Madam, listen to me

13:38.458 --> 13:41.101
we have to investigate this.
Do you understand?

13:41.291 --> 13:44.166
Leave the check with us,
we'll solve the issue,

13:44.166 --> 13:46.217
and then you can deposit it.

13:46.384 --> 13:49.217
Excuse me, but I have to leave.
My pleasure.

13:49.384 --> 13:51.217
- Show the madam out, please.
- Yes, sure.

13:51.217 --> 13:52.689
Alright.

13:53.735 --> 13:55.152
Come with me, madam.

14:05.373 --> 14:07.032
- Would you like one?
- No, I quit.

14:08.117 --> 14:11.572
When did you quit,
if we smoked after lunch yesterday?

14:11.572 --> 14:12.623
Right then.

14:13.769 --> 14:14.894
What a will!

14:15.480 --> 14:16.689
I made the decision.

14:18.975 --> 14:22.271
Did you take any pills?
Patches, anything?

14:22.370 --> 14:23.467
No, nothing.

14:27.114 --> 14:28.496
I'll have one.

14:29.565 --> 14:30.565
Sure?

14:30.921 --> 14:31.921
Yes.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.931
I was thinking...

14:52.931 --> 14:55.326
nobody listens to voice mail anymore.

14:56.295 --> 14:57.802
I'll have to keep on calling.

14:58.237 --> 14:59.528
Yes, you better call him.

15:05.186 --> 15:06.475
Another one?

15:06.670 --> 15:07.977
You're going to die, Del Toro!

15:08.130 --> 15:09.435
Oh yeah? And what about you?

15:09.435 --> 15:10.943
You're immortal, Morán.

15:12.234 --> 15:13.926
I love to smoke two in a row.

15:13.926 --> 15:16.301
Especially now that you have
to go out to smoke.

15:18.358 --> 15:20.194
One could smoke at the bank,

15:20.668 --> 15:21.714
restaurants,

15:21.714 --> 15:24.108
on planes, at the office.

15:24.858 --> 15:26.584
Everything was a big cloud of smoke.

15:26.852 --> 15:28.029
Real toxic,

15:28.528 --> 15:29.861
and nobody cared.

15:30.529 --> 15:31.748
Do you know why?

15:32.506 --> 15:33.903
Because everybody smoked.

15:34.647 --> 15:36.567
I don't know.
I'm a former smoker.

15:36.884 --> 15:38.384
I'm from another generation.

15:39.542 --> 15:42.559
I am an old-timer
who longs for that era.

15:44.826 --> 15:46.535
We had more freedom.

15:47.670 --> 15:50.900
Would you say
there was more freedom, Rolando?

15:52.443 --> 15:53.443
No, you're right.

15:54.089 --> 15:57.172
There wasn't more freedom,
but you could smoke anywhere.

16:03.440 --> 16:04.869
Tell me something, Morán,

16:05.061 --> 16:06.563
When did you quit smoking?

16:08.410 --> 16:09.605
This is my last one.

16:30.096 --> 16:31.716
Isnardi, won't you back me up?

16:31.891 --> 16:33.534
Can't you see I'm busy?

16:33.732 --> 16:35.649
I have to go to talk to Del Toro.

16:36.115 --> 16:39.708
Can it wait?
I have to go downstairs with Morán.

16:39.865 --> 16:41.549
Close your counter
and let them wait.

16:41.549 --> 16:44.036
There are eight people,
I have to get this thing off!

16:44.169 --> 16:46.755
It's been ages
since I was a teller, please.

16:46.934 --> 16:48.996
Come on, just until
closing time, I beg you.

16:50.566 --> 16:52.942
- Is there change?
- Yes, there is.

16:53.286 --> 16:54.286
Thank you!

16:56.404 --> 16:57.406
Román.

16:57.406 --> 16:58.457
Morán.

17:02.790 --> 17:04.147
Yes, come in.

17:09.519 --> 17:10.714
What is it, Román?

17:10.818 --> 17:12.735
Excuse me, Del Toro,
I have to leave.

17:13.728 --> 17:15.436
And why is that?

17:17.264 --> 17:19.473
I told you before,
I'm getting the collar removed.

17:20.218 --> 17:22.827
At last!
How long have you had it?

17:22.827 --> 17:25.511
Not so long, but I can't stand it.
I can't sleep.

17:26.034 --> 17:27.190
Who'll cover for you?

17:27.190 --> 17:29.715
- Isnardi, he's at my counter.
- Okay.

17:30.485 --> 17:32.091
Will he sign the statement?

17:32.364 --> 17:33.364
Yes.

17:33.585 --> 17:35.145
What are you doing this weekend?

17:35.145 --> 17:36.489
I'll stay in town.

17:37.340 --> 17:39.275
- See you on Tuesday?
- See you.

17:39.275 --> 17:41.518
- Have a nice weekend.
- Thank you.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.732
$12,996 dollars...

17:50.009 --> 17:51.535
by 25 years...

17:53.551 --> 17:56.801
$324,900 dollars.

18:02.051 --> 18:04.676
$324,900 dollars.

18:07.608 --> 18:09.324
Isnardi, I'm leaving.

18:09.472 --> 18:11.421
- Thank you.
- You owe me one.

18:11.421 --> 18:13.097
Fifty, counter number 4.

18:14.884 --> 18:16.467
- By two.
- Morning.

18:16.884 --> 18:18.266
I want to make a deposit.

19:01.852 --> 19:03.425
- To you...
- Thanks.

19:04.525 --> 19:05.525
Thanks.

19:06.141 --> 19:08.141
Isnardi, shall we make a deposit?

19:08.141 --> 19:09.430
I can't.

19:09.430 --> 19:11.731
I have to be here until closure.

19:13.527 --> 19:14.610
You go.

19:15.518 --> 19:16.890
I'll be right back.

19:16.890 --> 19:19.440
- They fucked me, huh?
- Sign here, please.

25:11.220 --> 25:12.710
- Hey, what's up?
- What's up?

25:12.710 --> 25:14.282
- Fine?
- Follow me.

25:14.282 --> 25:16.064
- What’s up?
- Follow me.

25:16.064 --> 25:17.346
All good.

25:18.723 --> 25:20.442
- How are you? Fine?
- Yeah.

25:20.607 --> 25:21.832
What happened?

25:37.289 --> 25:39.355
Cheers.

25:42.645 --> 25:44.895
- What's up?
- I have a proposal.

25:44.895 --> 25:45.946
What?

25:46.659 --> 25:47.774
Business?

25:48.121 --> 25:49.282
Yes, business.

25:51.698 --> 25:52.973
Look down.

25:54.591 --> 25:56.504
- Huh?
- Look down!

25:58.703 --> 26:00.335
Between my feet, you see it?

26:00.492 --> 26:01.534
Yeah, the bag.

26:02.949 --> 26:05.449
I need you keep that bag
for three and a half years.

26:06.881 --> 26:09.847
Why? Three and a half years?
I don't get it.

26:10.889 --> 26:12.904
It has $650,000 dollars.

26:14.668 --> 26:16.310
I took it from the bank today.

26:20.168 --> 26:21.970
You can report me if you want,
it's okay.

26:21.970 --> 26:24.459
Go to the station,
say that a coworker stole it.

26:24.838 --> 26:26.205
I'll turn myself in anyway.

26:27.500 --> 26:30.073
I need you to hold onto it
and look after it.

26:32.367 --> 26:33.659
Are you insane?

26:36.121 --> 26:39.097
Someone has to look after it
while I serve my sentence.

26:40.006 --> 26:41.298
In three and a half years,

26:41.779 --> 26:43.412
when I get out,
we split it.

26:43.966 --> 26:46.231
Half is yours,
and we never work again.

26:47.137 --> 26:49.221
Your sentence?
Are you going to jail?

26:50.036 --> 26:51.536
Three and a half, not more.

26:52.295 --> 26:54.795
And how do you know
it's three and a half?

26:56.831 --> 26:58.039
Well, it's six actually.

26:58.646 --> 27:00.813
But for good conduct,
three and a half years.

27:08.904 --> 27:09.904
Listen to me.

27:10.821 --> 27:13.442
Have you considered how many
years it is until you retire?

27:15.149 --> 27:16.344
Twenty-five years.

27:18.540 --> 27:20.476
Look, here.

27:21.235 --> 27:23.413
I have $650,000, all in dollars.

27:24.126 --> 27:25.321
In the backpack,

27:26.137 --> 27:29.007
I've got some pesos, not much,
$330,000.

27:29.007 --> 27:30.587
I'm going to need them now.

27:32.271 --> 27:36.938
$325,000 dollars is the equivalent
of our salary until we retire.

27:37.319 --> 27:39.392
Not a penny more, not a penny less.

27:39.392 --> 27:42.161
That's what we get, if we go
to the bank every day of our lives.

27:42.919 --> 27:45.606
$325,000 dollars, each.

27:45.816 --> 27:47.180
That's what I have here.

27:47.180 --> 27:48.871
$325,000 dollars

27:49.148 --> 27:50.148
between two.

27:51.010 --> 27:53.594
I want a modest life.
I don't want to work anymore, Román.

27:53.731 --> 27:55.045
And if you do what I say,

27:55.376 --> 27:56.626
you can do the same.

27:57.176 --> 28:00.320
You'll get your salary every month
without having to work.

28:01.286 --> 28:04.286
Three and a half years in jail,
or twenty-five in the bank.

28:12.047 --> 28:13.089
Why me?

28:14.059 --> 28:15.091
Why me?

28:15.091 --> 28:17.386
You are lucky, Román,
you don't have to do anything.

28:17.386 --> 28:19.122
Just be careful,

28:19.122 --> 28:20.256
keep it safe.

28:20.832 --> 28:24.457
When I'm out, we split it up
and that's it, that's all.

28:25.355 --> 28:27.330
And if I go to the bank
and return it?

28:31.364 --> 28:33.948
Everyone would know it was me,
I'm turning myself in.

28:34.373 --> 28:35.412
But listen,

28:36.263 --> 28:37.759
I can say you're my accomplice.

28:37.759 --> 28:40.974
You went to take off your collar
because I had to go down to vault.

28:41.559 --> 28:42.825
You left me a clear path.

28:42.997 --> 28:45.946
Isnardi went to the counter,
I took the dollars with ease.

28:45.946 --> 28:47.706
It's nothing, Roman,
I'll say it.

28:48.555 --> 28:49.555
I will say it.

28:50.076 --> 28:52.215
But what are you saying?
Have you gone mad?

28:58.143 --> 28:59.393
You can rest easy.

28:59.990 --> 29:02.115
No one, absolutely no one,

29:03.068 --> 29:04.652
will suspect you, Román.

29:05.841 --> 29:07.318
You are an excellent employee.

29:07.318 --> 29:08.910
It's on your face, brother.

29:12.516 --> 29:14.055
What are you going to do now?

29:15.300 --> 29:16.300
Nothing.

29:17.055 --> 29:20.862
There's some furniture in the flat,
clothes that I don't care about.

29:21.581 --> 29:23.539
In a couple of months
the lease is due.

29:24.855 --> 29:25.929
Nothing to lose.

29:32.754 --> 29:33.810
Listen to me, look...

29:35.602 --> 29:36.654
I have a present for you.

29:37.302 --> 29:38.726
The only thing I took with me.

29:41.810 --> 29:43.102
No, I can't.

29:44.024 --> 29:45.161
It's a great album.

29:45.808 --> 29:48.703
Yes, I know it's great
but it implicates me, Morán.

29:49.068 --> 29:50.613
I can't accept it.

30:05.751 --> 30:07.305
What's the next step?

30:10.503 --> 30:11.563
I'll leave now,

30:12.584 --> 30:16.201
we'll meet again
in three and a half years, okay?

30:18.857 --> 30:19.880
Look,

30:20.083 --> 30:22.185
that's to pay for the pizza.

30:22.707 --> 30:24.488
It's about time
I invited you, right?

32:39.485 --> 32:40.944
What are you doing?

32:41.438 --> 32:42.583
Turn it off Flor!

32:42.719 --> 32:44.547
Why are you awake at this hour?

32:50.563 --> 32:51.656
Coming?

33:59.611 --> 34:00.744
Shall I carry on?

34:00.744 --> 34:01.855
Where are we?

34:03.384 --> 34:05.274
Kilometer 530.

34:05.712 --> 34:07.837
Drive for another 200 kilometers
and drop me off.

34:48.809 --> 34:49.818
Good morning, sir.

34:49.818 --> 34:52.363
- Good day.
- Driver's license?

34:52.514 --> 34:54.768
- Of course.
- Vehicle registration card...

34:57.154 --> 34:58.747
Check the lights.

35:00.176 --> 35:02.489
- Vehicle ID.
- Okay.

35:03.904 --> 35:06.046
- License.
- Very well.

35:18.285 --> 35:20.493
Are you licensed
to carry passengers?

35:20.493 --> 35:21.597
Yes.

35:25.371 --> 35:26.604
ID, please.

35:32.509 --> 35:33.717
Check it.

35:34.051 --> 35:35.834
- I'll check.
- Go on.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.451
Is there any problem, officer?

35:37.676 --> 35:39.717
No, routine check, that's all.

35:39.884 --> 35:41.634
Nothing to worry about.

35:44.644 --> 35:47.808
Alright,
here are your documents.

35:48.231 --> 35:49.254
Thanks.

35:52.431 --> 35:54.069
Where are you heading?

35:56.100 --> 35:57.549
Alpa Corral, officer.

36:13.670 --> 36:15.258
No news.

36:15.730 --> 36:18.755
- You may go on.
- Thanks.

39:50.119 --> 39:51.204
Can I play?

39:51.204 --> 39:52.297
Sure.

40:01.045 --> 40:02.206
Which team?

41:35.628 --> 41:37.126
- What's up?
- Chief,

41:37.126 --> 41:40.136
this man is here to report
that he committed a crime.

41:40.447 --> 41:41.572
What has he done?

41:41.572 --> 41:42.641
Bank robbery.

41:42.879 --> 41:43.925
A bank?

41:44.243 --> 41:45.403
What's up?

41:45.717 --> 41:46.737
He robbed a bank.

41:46.841 --> 41:48.008
You robbed a bank?

41:48.446 --> 41:49.738
Sir, what's your name?

41:50.176 --> 41:51.509
Morán.

41:51.769 --> 41:53.352
Ponce, stay with Morán,

41:53.528 --> 41:54.824
you, step in my office.

42:03.953 --> 42:04.989
- Ponce.
- Yes?

42:04.989 --> 42:07.290
- Come here with the gentleman.
- Come with me please.

42:10.993 --> 42:12.076
Sit down.

42:15.798 --> 42:18.579
Sir, I'll cuff you,
put your hands up.

43:00.801 --> 43:02.334
Isnardi!

43:02.334 --> 43:03.417
Are you okay?

43:03.417 --> 43:04.709
What happened?

43:04.709 --> 43:06.618
Oh, my chest hurts!

43:06.759 --> 43:08.216
He's having a heart attack!

43:08.216 --> 43:10.183
No, not a heart attack! No!

43:10.592 --> 43:12.592
- Calm down!
- My chest hurts.

43:12.701 --> 43:14.388
Not the key!
Leave it with me.

43:14.525 --> 43:15.917
What's going on?

43:15.917 --> 43:17.626
- What's up?
- He's unwell.

43:17.626 --> 43:18.717
No one's answering.

43:19.217 --> 43:20.876
Lift him up, sit him here.

43:20.876 --> 43:22.217
Don't take off my shoes.

43:22.423 --> 43:23.865
Sit him down.

43:24.774 --> 43:25.844
What happened?

43:26.083 --> 43:27.667
Oh, forgive me, Del Toro.

43:28.902 --> 43:31.193
Tony, turn that around, please.

43:31.629 --> 43:33.254
Why are you watching that? Why?

43:34.233 --> 43:35.567
No one's answering.

43:36.786 --> 43:39.745
- Are you calling the emergency number?
- Oh, my chest hurts.

43:39.928 --> 43:41.857
Oh, my hand is numb.

43:42.622 --> 43:44.856
- Sit back.
- Some water?

43:44.856 --> 43:47.133
No, it's okay,
oh well yes. I don't know.

43:51.259 --> 43:52.259
Alright.

43:52.822 --> 43:53.829
Sorry.

43:53.829 --> 43:55.927
He fainted.
You fell backwards.

43:57.120 --> 43:58.161
We have to talk.

44:09.240 --> 44:12.115
I have strict orders
that this must remain between us.

44:13.046 --> 44:15.626
If we want to keep
our clients' loyalty,

44:15.626 --> 44:17.136
this robbery never happened.

44:17.792 --> 44:20.708
We will make you sign
confidentiality statements

44:20.708 --> 44:22.387
issued by the insurance company.

44:24.352 --> 44:27.060
They will repay the missing amount.

44:27.060 --> 44:30.301
That administrative issue
doesn't concern me at all,

44:30.301 --> 44:32.394
but the internal situation is serious.

44:32.995 --> 44:34.049
Really serious!

44:37.509 --> 44:40.759
What we know so far
is that he took dollars.

44:41.051 --> 44:43.842
It was quite a sum,
but it could've been worse.

44:44.522 --> 44:45.528
Huh?

44:45.528 --> 44:48.644
And the security cameras show,
as you can see,

44:48.644 --> 44:50.585
that Morán was the perpetrator.

44:52.274 --> 44:54.441
But there is
a chain of responsibilities here.

44:55.044 --> 44:56.140
And we are all,

44:56.140 --> 44:58.441
each one of us, involved.

45:00.011 --> 45:01.294
There was a breach

45:01.294 --> 45:04.803
of the trust that the bank
had in each of you.

45:06.174 --> 45:08.750
I had to put up with
yelling from head office.

45:08.750 --> 45:11.269
And you should know,
I won't protect anyone.

45:11.465 --> 45:14.590
I think that any of you could be guilty.

45:15.217 --> 45:16.926
Excuse me, Del Toro, but I think

45:16.926 --> 45:19.250
what you're saying is really unfair.

45:19.468 --> 45:21.093
- Unfair?
- Yes. Unfair.

45:21.206 --> 45:23.196
Oh, unfair, sure, unfair.

45:23.967 --> 45:25.817
One of you, and probably,

45:25.817 --> 45:28.483
certainly more than one,
committed a felony,

45:28.974 --> 45:30.308
and put my job at risk.

45:30.467 --> 45:31.877
Not just mine, but everyone's.

45:31.877 --> 45:32.927
I agree.

45:33.099 --> 45:35.295
Everyone's, yes.
And you call me unfair.

45:36.711 --> 45:39.878
Do you know for how long
I've been working here?

45:40.052 --> 45:41.261
Huh? Any idea? No?

45:41.261 --> 45:42.551
55 years.

45:43.779 --> 45:45.071
55 years.

45:45.874 --> 45:47.416
How old are you, Del Toro?

45:47.416 --> 45:48.884
In a manner of speaking.

45:49.961 --> 45:52.027
A whole lifetime devoted to this!

45:52.574 --> 45:54.532
And you have the nerve
to call me unfair?

45:54.676 --> 45:56.541
Because you're only looking at me.

45:56.541 --> 45:58.384
Our colleague is right though?

45:58.759 --> 46:01.592
Because there's a perpetrator here
who's clearly identified.

46:01.592 --> 46:02.697
I don't care.

46:02.697 --> 46:05.457
All I say to you is that, as of today,

46:05.926 --> 46:07.884
every one of you is under suspicion.

46:09.079 --> 46:12.125
I want you to know that.
We had worked peacefully until now,

46:12.125 --> 46:14.842
and after this situation,
that is over.

46:15.384 --> 46:17.603
I believed in you,
and I don't believe anymore.

46:20.318 --> 46:22.872
Morán, you fucking son of a bitch!

46:23.759 --> 46:26.259
Well, I just wanted to
introduce myself,

46:26.426 --> 46:29.728
my name is Laura Ortega,
I am a national CPA,

46:29.842 --> 46:32.384
but in this case I am acting
as an investigator.

46:33.051 --> 46:37.051
The insurance company asked me
to lead this internal investigation.

46:38.683 --> 46:41.425
- Perfect. What, what...?
- What investigation?

46:41.759 --> 46:43.959
Investigating the chain
of responsibilities

46:43.959 --> 46:46.260
that Del Toro was just talking about.
Nothing else.

46:46.260 --> 46:50.221
What do we have to do with it?
The perpetrator has been identified.

46:50.467 --> 46:52.551
That's the thing,
we should see...

46:53.509 --> 46:56.051
if he had any accomplices...

46:56.051 --> 46:58.375
If I'm not wrong,
he's the bank's treasurer?

46:58.375 --> 46:59.459
Yes, the treasurer.

46:59.459 --> 47:02.455
For the treasurer to carry out
such a felony.

47:02.801 --> 47:04.333
I am offended by what you say.

47:04.333 --> 47:06.384
- Laura is your name?
- Laura, yes.

47:06.801 --> 47:09.384
It offends me because
we are here and we don't...

47:09.717 --> 47:11.833
You know? It fucks us all...

47:11.833 --> 47:15.666
I understand that my arrival
is unpleasant.

47:15.666 --> 47:18.176
But it's the right thing to do
in a case like this.

47:18.457 --> 47:20.166
The idea is for you to trust me.

47:20.166 --> 47:21.676
To cooperate with me.

47:21.833 --> 47:24.947
I will take your statements.
And you can keep calm.

47:25.383 --> 47:27.175
We will work together.

47:27.384 --> 47:30.217
The more information I gather,

47:30.384 --> 47:32.801
the quicker we resolve this mess...

47:32.967 --> 47:34.042
What do you think?

47:34.042 --> 47:35.101
You agree, right?

47:35.101 --> 47:37.334
- Yes.
- Do you agree?

47:37.334 --> 47:38.792
- Are you Ivanchuk?
- Yes.

47:38.983 --> 47:41.400
- Come with me, please.
- Where to?

47:42.004 --> 47:44.881
To Del Toro's office.
I'll come back for you all.

47:57.152 --> 47:58.568
Okay, the one we did last class.

47:59.064 --> 48:00.592
We can be quieter,

48:00.592 --> 48:02.475
and you improvise.

48:02.475 --> 48:03.898
We'll wrap up.

48:13.634 --> 48:14.634
Good.

48:15.509 --> 48:17.342
Shall we use instruments?

48:19.217 --> 48:20.759
The melodica?

48:23.274 --> 48:24.982
Ready, Auro?

48:25.917 --> 48:28.757
You look at me,
and we start together?

48:41.190 --> 48:43.607
That's it...
shorter now.

48:54.570 --> 48:56.362
One more time.

49:22.444 --> 49:23.986
Can I have a glass of water?

49:24.098 --> 49:26.056
Yes, just a second.

49:32.801 --> 49:34.433
Tap water ok?

49:34.707 --> 49:35.707
Yup.

49:36.998 --> 49:37.998
There.

49:48.502 --> 49:49.702
Can I have another one?

49:49.702 --> 49:50.924
Sure.

49:56.024 --> 49:57.070
Here.

50:02.300 --> 50:03.578
And another?

50:18.337 --> 50:20.738
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

50:22.645 --> 50:25.186
No, not that way!

50:26.842 --> 50:28.066
It's this way.

51:28.470 --> 51:29.762
What are you doing?

51:30.723 --> 51:31.931
Are you awake?

51:32.349 --> 51:33.937
I woke up just now.

51:35.575 --> 51:36.909
Just now, when?

51:37.509 --> 51:39.351
Just now, where were you going?

51:39.931 --> 51:42.413
I was going
to fetch a glass of water.

52:07.051 --> 52:09.009
We are forced to do this...

52:10.551 --> 52:12.610
It is because
of the bank's status.

52:12.610 --> 52:15.410
We are in a critical situation. Honestly.

52:16.200 --> 52:18.291
But, well, please...

52:18.291 --> 52:19.551
Go on.

52:19.551 --> 52:22.394
Let's keep on working.

52:47.572 --> 52:48.612
Sir!

52:50.251 --> 52:52.518
Sorry, is this counter open?

52:52.759 --> 52:54.845
- Come over, please.
- I want to change 500 dollars.

52:54.845 --> 52:56.230
ID please.

52:58.626 --> 53:00.571
- Withdrawal?
- Yes.

53:05.006 --> 53:07.180
From my savings account.

53:07.180 --> 53:08.230
Perfect.

53:18.344 --> 53:19.757
Signature and name, please.

53:39.527 --> 53:40.743
There you go.

53:40.743 --> 53:42.527
- Thank you.
- No worries.

53:44.340 --> 53:45.965
What are you doing here?
Where's Tony?

53:46.350 --> 53:48.521
Laid-off indefinitely.

53:48.881 --> 53:50.791
They sent me to work the counter.

53:57.059 --> 53:59.262
Do you know why Marianela is crying?

53:59.262 --> 54:01.047
Because her salary was cut.

54:02.418 --> 54:05.598
You got lucky.
You weren't here when it happened.

54:11.738 --> 54:12.904
I feel guilty.

54:13.592 --> 54:15.286
No, why should you feel bad?

54:16.427 --> 54:19.770
The problem is this Ortega bitch
who's killing us all.

54:22.875 --> 54:24.000
So unfair!

54:27.009 --> 54:28.024
Guys!

54:28.024 --> 54:29.180
It's my last day!

54:30.769 --> 54:32.102
Thanks so much for everything.

54:46.536 --> 54:47.536
So...

54:47.869 --> 54:48.883
Ortega?

54:48.883 --> 54:51.041
Yes, could have been any of us.

54:51.162 --> 54:52.829
A lapse in security.

54:53.574 --> 54:54.699
Well...

54:56.550 --> 54:58.258
It's been a pleasure.

55:09.134 --> 55:10.660
Come on in, have a seat.

55:16.645 --> 55:18.520
Were you friends with Mr. Morán?

55:19.176 --> 55:20.176
Friends?

55:20.801 --> 55:22.467
I don't come here to make friends.

55:23.173 --> 55:26.023
But you were aware
of Mr. Morán's plans?

55:27.199 --> 55:29.554
Is that a question or a statement?
I don't get it.

55:29.554 --> 55:30.991
As you like it.

55:31.634 --> 55:33.062
No, I wasn't aware.

55:34.206 --> 55:36.085
You were aware? You weren't?

55:36.085 --> 55:37.374
Sorry, I don't understand.

55:37.374 --> 55:38.452
No.

55:38.452 --> 55:41.388
No, comma, I was not aware.

55:43.134 --> 55:47.023
But you met with Mr. Moran
after the robbery, didn't you?

55:48.576 --> 55:51.826
I thought I came to answer questions,
not accusations.

55:52.436 --> 55:54.363
It's Laura's style, Román.

55:54.363 --> 55:57.809
Some people ask questions
as if they were affirmations

55:57.809 --> 55:59.921
but don't think of it
as an accusation.

56:01.493 --> 56:02.938
It so happens, Román,

56:03.938 --> 56:06.391
that all statements agree

56:07.134 --> 56:09.875
that you requested to leave the bank

56:09.875 --> 56:11.426
on the day the robbery was committed.

56:11.708 --> 56:13.027
Please understand that

56:13.027 --> 56:16.161
this is a coincidence
that is quite outstanding.

56:16.993 --> 56:19.102
I understand that
it draws your attention.

56:19.668 --> 56:23.722
Mr. Del Toro knows
that I had asked for this in advance.

56:24.092 --> 56:26.511
No, no, I don't remember, Román.

56:27.176 --> 56:30.824
I asked you as soon
as I got my appointment.

56:42.427 --> 56:44.469
Is your wife pregnant?

56:45.305 --> 56:46.472
No, not at all.

56:48.092 --> 56:50.121
No, comma, not at all.

56:54.032 --> 56:56.520
Do you know that Mr. Morán
turned himself in to the police?

56:58.149 --> 56:59.357
No, I knew nothing.

57:00.340 --> 57:01.353
Yes,

57:01.353 --> 57:02.904
he is being held in jail.

57:04.230 --> 57:06.332
- I didn't know that.
- You didn't.

57:09.328 --> 57:11.595
We were informed today
by the District Attorney's office.

57:12.634 --> 57:15.590
This means
that one issue is complicated,

57:16.092 --> 57:17.665
and another one is solved.

57:18.748 --> 57:20.915
That this man has turned himself in,

57:22.634 --> 57:24.951
partly answers
who is guilty of the crime.

57:25.926 --> 57:27.259
What it doesn't answer,

57:28.051 --> 57:29.629
is what happened with the money.

57:33.349 --> 57:35.050
What do you think about that, Román?

57:36.750 --> 57:38.042
I don't have a clue.

57:40.008 --> 57:42.218
It seems that all the bank's staff

57:42.218 --> 57:44.614
has come to an agreement
and no one has a clue.

57:49.809 --> 57:51.309
What do you know about that, Román?

57:52.166 --> 57:53.166
About what?

57:53.166 --> 57:56.306
The money, of what Morán
could have done with the money.

57:57.793 --> 57:58.793
I don't know.

01:00:51.801 --> 01:00:52.842
Coming!

01:00:58.347 --> 01:00:59.930
I was taking a shower.

01:01:01.766 --> 01:01:03.599
Want to take a shower with me?

01:01:04.802 --> 01:01:06.086
Well, okay.

01:01:38.342 --> 01:01:41.301
We're thinking about going away
for the weekend, with the girls.

01:01:42.203 --> 01:01:44.411
Three days, somewhere outdoors.

01:01:45.592 --> 01:01:47.715
The idea is to go and
write some songs.

01:01:47.972 --> 01:01:49.546
Record them, maybe...

01:01:50.342 --> 01:01:51.400
What do you say?

01:01:52.634 --> 01:01:53.751
Cool, isn't it?

01:01:55.008 --> 01:01:56.700
The idea is to go on our own.

01:01:57.176 --> 01:02:00.000
Get away from the city,
a breath of fresh air.

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:16.128
Come on, Morán!

01:04:41.881 --> 01:04:43.590
I like it with lentils, right.

01:04:47.723 --> 01:04:49.193
But red sausage...

01:04:49.926 --> 01:04:50.970
Tell him.

01:04:51.217 --> 01:04:53.592
Tell him "Don't use red sausage."

01:04:58.634 --> 01:05:01.255
It gave me an upset stomach,
that sausage.

01:05:10.467 --> 01:05:11.728
Time!

01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:29.713
Kid!

01:05:30.551 --> 01:05:32.751
Again! What's
wrong with him? Hey!

01:05:32.751 --> 01:05:34.842
Can't you see I haven't called yet?

01:05:35.009 --> 01:05:36.717
No!
Where do you think you are?

01:05:36.946 --> 01:05:39.406
- Huh?
- And what do you--

01:05:43.926 --> 01:05:45.227
Walk straight...

01:06:11.019 --> 01:06:12.477
This isn't like outside.

01:06:16.498 --> 01:06:19.207
In here the time to talk
on the phone has to be short.

01:06:23.342 --> 01:06:26.634
There is only one thing, you see,
about jail that saves you.

01:06:27.675 --> 01:06:28.758
Do you know what it is?

01:06:30.317 --> 01:06:31.400
The little screen.

01:06:33.313 --> 01:06:36.396
Outside, everyone
is watching their phones.

01:06:36.967 --> 01:06:39.603
The messages, pictures,
the comments.

01:06:41.217 --> 01:06:43.125
Everyone thinks they're free,

01:06:43.125 --> 01:06:46.092
and they're constantly
refreshing web pages, do you get it?

01:06:47.792 --> 01:06:49.042
That doesn't happen here.

01:06:49.818 --> 01:06:51.658
We have to find
some sort of advantage.

01:06:57.592 --> 01:06:59.170
Outside, they don't have any.

01:06:59.730 --> 01:07:01.914
And in here we have
plenty of it. Time.

01:07:02.574 --> 01:07:03.622
Except...

01:07:04.592 --> 01:07:06.634
at the communal phones.

01:07:07.801 --> 01:07:10.855
There we're all nervous, in a hurry.

01:07:11.582 --> 01:07:13.248
Better not to insist...

01:07:13.801 --> 01:07:16.832
So if it's busy, nobody answers...

01:07:19.115 --> 01:07:21.282
best to give the chance to a mate.

01:07:22.626 --> 01:07:23.668
Do you understand?

01:07:32.243 --> 01:07:33.243
Come with me.

01:07:42.708 --> 01:07:44.833
I'm Garrincha, what's your name?

01:07:44.961 --> 01:07:45.961
Morán.

01:07:46.724 --> 01:07:48.849
So, you came with money, Morán.

01:07:50.063 --> 01:07:51.782
I wouldn't be here if I had money.

01:07:52.105 --> 01:07:53.146
How so?

01:07:53.847 --> 01:07:56.388
I mean, I wouldn't be here.
I'd be somewhere else.

01:07:59.245 --> 01:08:01.026
I think it's the other way around.

01:08:01.842 --> 01:08:04.042
If you're here it's
because you have it.

01:08:04.042 --> 01:08:06.426
The thing is that
you earned it unlawfully.

01:08:06.937 --> 01:08:07.937
Look...

01:08:07.937 --> 01:08:10.050
those who end up here,
it's because they earned it.

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.953
And if they earned it,
then they've stashed it somewhere.

01:08:14.176 --> 01:08:15.801
What do you want, Garrincha?

01:08:16.174 --> 01:08:17.666
Ah, he's quick, this fellow.

01:08:17.666 --> 01:08:19.058
I want to know.

01:08:19.826 --> 01:08:21.224
Let's cut to the chase.

01:08:25.606 --> 01:08:28.397
I offer
certain assurances in this ward.

01:08:29.473 --> 01:08:31.262
Let's say I'm the boss.

01:08:32.566 --> 01:08:34.107
Do you like soccer?

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:35.910
Sure.

01:08:37.795 --> 01:08:39.962
Believe it or not,
I was born in Brazil.

01:08:41.087 --> 01:08:44.176
When I was a child I was given
to an Argentinean family, and well...

01:08:44.176 --> 01:08:45.644
I crossed the border.

01:08:46.779 --> 01:08:48.705
And in Brazil, the best is not Pelé.

01:08:48.884 --> 01:08:50.051
It's Garrincha.

01:08:51.092 --> 01:08:53.384
The one we love the most,
we respect the most.

01:08:54.926 --> 01:08:57.009
So, pretend you're in Brazil.

01:08:58.797 --> 01:09:00.797
If only we were in Brazil!

01:09:02.353 --> 01:09:04.478
You don't know
what a prison is like in Brazil.

01:09:05.417 --> 01:09:09.018
I assure you that you wouldn't last
a second in a Brazilian jail.

01:09:10.004 --> 01:09:11.795
Look, I'm offering you protection.

01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:16.557
So if you are with me
and pay me every month,

01:09:17.467 --> 01:09:19.042
you'll have a quiet life,

01:09:19.042 --> 01:09:20.713
you'll be able to do what you want.

01:09:21.547 --> 01:09:23.422
What you want inside
these walls, right?

01:09:25.344 --> 01:09:26.853
Let me think about it.

01:09:41.730 --> 01:09:43.089
Do you see, Morán?

01:09:43.617 --> 01:09:45.448
There's not much to think about.

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:47.085
Go.

01:09:47.085 --> 01:09:49.011
Steady now, back to your cell.

01:09:49.301 --> 01:09:50.762
He'll give you the amount,

01:09:50.762 --> 01:09:52.271
and payment method.

01:09:56.044 --> 01:09:58.408
And... I'm expensive, my friend.

01:10:26.256 --> 01:10:27.435
Morán!

01:10:31.292 --> 01:10:32.500
Come here.

01:10:40.532 --> 01:10:42.157
What happens?

01:10:49.302 --> 01:10:50.419
That

01:10:50.419 --> 01:10:52.262
is an account number, Garrincha's.

01:10:53.123 --> 01:10:54.457
For you to pay him.

01:12:12.850 --> 01:12:15.021
- Next, please.
- Good afternoon.

01:12:16.884 --> 01:12:19.469
Good, it would be...

01:12:20.481 --> 01:12:22.717
Good afternoon.
I wish to withdraw some money.

01:12:22.856 --> 01:12:24.463
How much do you wish to withdraw?

01:12:24.463 --> 01:12:26.957
Four hundred
and sixty thousand, please.

01:12:28.057 --> 01:12:29.923
Well, sign here.

01:12:30.356 --> 01:12:32.097
Much obliged.

01:12:34.509 --> 01:12:36.676
Signature, name and ID.

01:12:40.228 --> 01:12:42.543
- Well, sign here.
- Who's that?

01:12:42.543 --> 01:12:44.184
The new guy.

01:12:45.165 --> 01:12:48.157
Ortega is preparing briefs
for some of us.

01:12:50.124 --> 01:12:52.541
On top of that,
the main office sends this new guy.

01:12:52.677 --> 01:12:54.416
His name is Vespucio.

01:12:54.416 --> 01:12:56.388
Thank you very much.

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.997
And here's the cabinet, see.

01:13:03.911 --> 01:13:05.318
I'll leave it here.

01:13:08.645 --> 01:13:10.708
So here are the keys.

01:13:10.811 --> 01:13:11.921
Thank you.

01:13:11.921 --> 01:13:14.187
Well, if you need anything...

01:13:14.187 --> 01:13:16.354
you let me know, ok?

01:13:17.259 --> 01:13:19.027
Great Ortega, thank you.

01:14:18.176 --> 01:14:19.356
Good.

01:14:23.247 --> 01:14:24.386
Go on.

01:14:48.563 --> 01:14:51.021
What are you doing here?
Are you mad?

01:14:53.759 --> 01:14:55.079
I need to talk to you.

01:14:57.332 --> 01:14:59.040
But you can't see me!

01:14:59.199 --> 01:15:00.683
Didn't you think of that?

01:15:01.715 --> 01:15:03.590
How would I call you?

01:15:03.759 --> 01:15:04.884
There's no other way.

01:15:05.592 --> 01:15:07.717
I don't know if you're mad
or dumb.

01:15:09.515 --> 01:15:11.542
He didn't even bring me
<i>yerba mate</i>!

01:15:11.542 --> 01:15:13.438
Home-made food he said...

01:15:17.467 --> 01:15:19.009
I quit smoking.

01:15:31.378 --> 01:15:33.044
Leave me alone for a while.

01:15:39.641 --> 01:15:41.099
Why are you here?

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:46.285
I can't stand it anymore, Morán.

01:15:46.285 --> 01:15:47.669
What can't you stand?

01:15:48.501 --> 01:15:49.501
The pressure.

01:15:49.884 --> 01:15:51.381
What are you talking about?

01:15:55.455 --> 01:15:57.038
I haven't slept for days.

01:15:57.038 --> 01:15:58.755
Do you think I can sleep here?

01:16:00.884 --> 01:16:03.126
You told me they weren't
going to suspect me.

01:16:03.261 --> 01:16:06.655
They sent a woman to the bank
who's asking me questions.

01:16:07.702 --> 01:16:10.053
Say what you need to say,
then maybe I can understand.

01:16:11.301 --> 01:16:13.085
I can't have it at home anymore.

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.017
I have to get it out of there.

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.525
Do you want me to snitch on you?

01:16:19.009 --> 01:16:20.009
Huh?

01:16:20.217 --> 01:16:21.467
I'll call Del Toro.

01:16:21.634 --> 01:16:22.667
Easy, Morán.

01:16:22.667 --> 01:16:25.813
Or I call the judge,
you'll be in here within two weeks.

01:16:26.136 --> 01:16:27.761
Please calm down, I beg you.

01:16:29.217 --> 01:16:30.834
You want me to send someone
to kill you?

01:16:30.834 --> 01:16:32.301
Stop it Morán, please.

01:16:32.467 --> 01:16:34.926
There are plenty of people here
to crush you, asshole.

01:16:38.217 --> 01:16:40.259
I'm gambling my life for this,
you know?

01:16:43.384 --> 01:16:44.646
What can I do?

01:16:48.842 --> 01:16:50.551
Do you have a lighter?

01:17:05.071 --> 01:17:06.696
You've got it all, right?

01:17:20.051 --> 01:17:22.051
You will deposit $30,000
in an account.

01:17:23.259 --> 01:17:24.699
I have to pay for some stuff.

01:17:25.384 --> 01:17:27.634
It's like an insurance
to stay alive in here.

01:17:28.426 --> 01:17:29.696
In which account?

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:38.850
Pesos or dollars?

01:17:39.439 --> 01:17:40.439
Dollars.

01:17:42.384 --> 01:17:43.801
Then you'll go to Alpa Corral.

01:17:44.634 --> 01:17:45.634
In Córdoba.

01:17:47.738 --> 01:17:49.863
You'll cross the only bridge there.

01:17:50.592 --> 01:17:53.584
And you'll take the dirt road
that runs along the river, upstream.

01:17:55.165 --> 01:17:57.553
There is a pine forest to the left.

01:17:59.121 --> 01:18:00.571
You'll walk through it.

01:18:02.212 --> 01:18:03.639
It ends in a ravine.

01:18:04.634 --> 01:18:06.787
Down there, you'll find
the Talita river

01:18:08.551 --> 01:18:11.385
There's like a lagoon,
it's pretty, you'll like it.

01:18:13.759 --> 01:18:15.740
Just in front of where you're standing,

01:18:16.384 --> 01:18:18.389
there's a cliff.

01:18:19.512 --> 01:18:21.717
Then you'll climb down the cliff,

01:18:23.217 --> 01:18:24.467
cross the river,

01:18:24.634 --> 01:18:26.384
the water is quite cold there.

01:18:27.759 --> 01:18:29.426
And you'll start climbing the hill

01:18:29.592 --> 01:18:30.967
to it's peak.

01:18:33.842 --> 01:18:35.384
Once you're there,

01:18:35.967 --> 01:18:38.051
you'll turn your back to the river.

01:18:38.962 --> 01:18:40.795
There are stones of all sizes there.

01:18:42.204 --> 01:18:43.704
Small, big.

01:18:45.384 --> 01:18:47.202
One of the stones is loose.

01:18:47.676 --> 01:18:49.467
If you lean on it,
you'll see it move.

01:18:50.717 --> 01:18:52.342
It's supporting a smaller rock.

01:18:54.342 --> 01:18:55.926
Place the money there,

01:18:56.762 --> 01:18:59.412
take out the small rock,
and that'll cover it.

01:21:45.634 --> 01:21:50.717
END OF PART ONE

01:22:07.757 --> 01:22:12.842
PART TWO

01:25:38.338 --> 01:25:39.767
Ouch!

01:25:40.572 --> 01:25:41.572
Ouch.

01:26:25.594 --> 01:26:28.210
Do you want us
to take you to the emergency room?

01:26:28.409 --> 01:26:29.994
We have a motorcycle.

01:26:29.994 --> 01:26:31.863
No, no need, I'll be fine.

01:27:28.929 --> 01:27:30.036
Hi.

01:27:30.036 --> 01:27:31.287
What were you doing up there?

01:27:31.287 --> 01:27:32.796
It's dangerous without a guide.

01:27:33.150 --> 01:27:34.817
I wanted to climb to the peak.

01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:37.240
You're quite overloaded
to be climbing up there.

01:27:39.685 --> 01:27:42.485
Do you always wander around in
your underwear in front of strangers?

01:27:42.891 --> 01:27:44.251
Are you from around here?

01:27:44.251 --> 01:27:45.302
No.

01:27:45.605 --> 01:27:48.021
She means if you are from here,
from planet Earth.

01:27:48.849 --> 01:27:50.830
Because this is an apparition zone.

01:27:51.279 --> 01:27:52.988
There's always "visitors."

01:28:05.304 --> 01:28:06.762
Do you want some water?

01:28:06.762 --> 01:28:07.813
No, thanks.

01:28:19.623 --> 01:28:20.665
Bye.

01:28:21.036 --> 01:28:22.484
Bye.

01:28:31.981 --> 01:28:33.684
Don't you want to stay for lunch?

01:28:33.684 --> 01:28:35.167
No, thank you.

01:28:35.521 --> 01:28:37.730
Bye.

01:28:50.266 --> 01:28:52.290
But we brought good stuff!

01:28:53.810 --> 01:28:56.403
Thanks, but no, I have to leave.

01:28:56.403 --> 01:28:57.912
I have to catch a bus.

01:28:58.359 --> 01:29:00.109
The next bus comes at night.

01:29:00.367 --> 01:29:01.617
Yes, I'll take that one.

01:29:01.847 --> 01:29:04.430
We can take you to the stop
on our bike tonight.

01:29:04.528 --> 01:29:06.796
- No, thanks, I need to leave.
- Don't be so unfriendly,

01:29:06.796 --> 01:29:08.598
we have lots of food.

01:29:11.719 --> 01:29:13.202
Go on, come here!

01:29:22.435 --> 01:29:23.622
What's your name?

01:29:24.493 --> 01:29:25.498
Román.

01:29:26.399 --> 01:29:27.399
Morna.

01:29:28.611 --> 01:29:29.641
Ramón.

01:29:30.511 --> 01:29:31.555
Norma.

01:29:40.281 --> 01:29:41.489
You had no breakfast?

01:29:41.902 --> 01:29:42.902
Just a little.

01:29:55.863 --> 01:29:57.236
Plenty of cicadas.

01:29:58.876 --> 01:29:59.876
Plenty of heat.

01:30:02.074 --> 01:30:04.581
Cicadas are summer creatures.

01:30:07.535 --> 01:30:10.643
That's the female,
and there's one that goes:

01:30:13.777 --> 01:30:15.120
That's the male.

01:30:23.746 --> 01:30:26.253
I'm here now shooting a movie.

01:30:28.170 --> 01:30:29.691
It's about gardens.

01:30:31.255 --> 01:30:33.510
A movie that I started in...

01:30:33.875 --> 01:30:34.958
in Viña, my hometown,

01:30:34.958 --> 01:30:36.384
I am from Viña.

01:30:38.294 --> 01:30:39.465
Have you been there?

01:30:39.465 --> 01:30:41.695
I've never been there,
but I know where it is.

01:30:42.025 --> 01:30:44.192
Viña is known
as the "garden city."

01:30:44.436 --> 01:30:46.436
So, in truth, I started filming

01:30:46.717 --> 01:30:48.220
like... gardens.

01:30:49.009 --> 01:30:51.853
Numerous different gardens in Viña.

01:30:52.441 --> 01:30:53.441
And...

01:30:54.029 --> 01:30:56.238
well, then I met Morna.

01:30:56.634 --> 01:31:00.385
I didn't manage to finish the film,
but in the end,

01:31:00.946 --> 01:31:03.122
it transformed and I continued
shooting it here.

01:31:03.401 --> 01:31:05.084
Like in this landscape

01:31:05.084 --> 01:31:07.301
of Alpa Corral that has lots of...

01:31:07.842 --> 01:31:08.926
of varieties of...

01:31:09.092 --> 01:31:11.756
it's very unique,
it has all these stones.

01:31:12.547 --> 01:31:13.547
And...

01:31:14.051 --> 01:31:16.842
and well, I'm here, filming with her.

01:31:17.771 --> 01:31:19.102
Wine?

01:31:22.490 --> 01:31:23.920
And here we are.

01:31:25.501 --> 01:31:27.834
I've been doing it
for a year and a half.

01:31:29.511 --> 01:31:30.927
More wine?

01:31:32.401 --> 01:31:33.651
Just a bit.

01:31:34.301 --> 01:31:35.334
That's enough!

01:31:35.334 --> 01:31:36.676
- Just that?
- Yes.

01:31:36.842 --> 01:31:38.252
The important thing is

01:31:38.252 --> 01:31:40.732
"With wine and bread,
the path is laid."

01:31:42.051 --> 01:31:44.013
After me:
"With wine and bread..."

01:31:44.884 --> 01:31:46.240
"...the path is laid."

01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:47.290
Exactly!

01:31:47.938 --> 01:31:50.376
"With wine and bread,
the path is laid."

01:31:50.884 --> 01:31:52.926
To your health, and welcome!

01:31:54.037 --> 01:31:55.037
Well,

01:31:55.176 --> 01:31:57.661
I'll tell you about the movie later,
I'm going for a swim.

01:33:07.509 --> 01:33:08.774
Here we go!

01:33:26.795 --> 01:33:28.042
Bombs away!

01:33:29.503 --> 01:33:30.894
Oh shit!

01:33:32.073 --> 01:33:33.714
Half spin!

01:33:39.185 --> 01:33:40.393
Like a stick!

01:33:43.253 --> 01:33:44.780
A little dove!

01:33:55.211 --> 01:33:56.495
More wine?

01:33:57.478 --> 01:34:00.362
When I was nine, I was going
with my mom once through a square,

01:34:00.362 --> 01:34:03.287
and I heard two girls playing
something that started like this

01:34:03.586 --> 01:34:04.745
"They were three...

01:34:04.745 --> 01:34:06.570
two Poles and a French."

01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:10.890
We kept walking and I wondered
how the game might continue.

01:34:11.003 --> 01:34:14.003
Was it a song, a riddle, a story?
I don't know.

01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:15.398
Or was it a game?

01:34:15.791 --> 01:34:18.019
I asked some friends,
but no one knew it.

01:34:18.019 --> 01:34:19.145
No, thanks.

01:34:19.145 --> 01:34:22.315
"They were three,
two Poles and a French."

01:34:23.619 --> 01:34:25.702
As an adult I searched the internet,
but nothing.

01:34:25.702 --> 01:34:28.128
That phrase meant nothing
to the internet.

01:34:30.045 --> 01:34:33.590
There's a world of memories
that internet doesn't understand.

01:34:36.961 --> 01:34:38.270
Yes, but for any of you,

01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:40.362
does it ring a bell?
Do you know what it is?

01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:43.203
- Not at all.
- It was...

01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:45.404
"They were three,
two Poles and a French."

01:34:46.461 --> 01:34:47.568
No.

01:34:48.865 --> 01:34:50.656
Can we make something up?

01:34:51.763 --> 01:34:55.013
Yes, but I'd love to know what
those girls were playing.

01:34:55.971 --> 01:34:59.555
Right. Best to make up
what you don't remember,

01:35:00.279 --> 01:35:02.821
leave it like that,
like one of life's mysteries.

01:35:03.411 --> 01:35:04.486
For example,

01:35:04.486 --> 01:35:07.051
"They were three,
two Poles and a French..."

01:35:07.422 --> 01:35:09.068
"one went and got a wine."

01:35:10.208 --> 01:35:12.333
Everything Ramón says
it's about wine,

01:35:12.333 --> 01:35:14.300
especially when he's drunk.

01:35:14.467 --> 01:35:16.217
Oh, such a bad vibe.

01:35:24.773 --> 01:35:25.791
"They were three,

01:35:25.791 --> 01:35:27.542
"two Poles and a French,

01:35:27.542 --> 01:35:29.809
- he fell in love with a..."
- Colonel!

01:35:29.809 --> 01:35:31.792
- The French?
- Yes!

01:35:31.792 --> 01:35:36.449
<i>♪ Going through a barrack,
She fell in love with a colonel</i>. ♪

01:35:36.724 --> 01:35:40.259
<i>♪ Raise the barriers
nd let the lantern girl through</i>, ♪

01:35:40.425 --> 01:35:42.684
<i>♪ From the gate to the sun ♪</i>

01:35:43.009 --> 01:35:47.046
<i>♪ Two and two are four,
four and two are six</i>... ♪

01:35:47.451 --> 01:35:49.250
Why do I still remember that?

01:35:49.250 --> 01:35:50.945
If it's nothing...

01:38:17.547 --> 01:38:18.718
Paramaribo.

01:38:22.025 --> 01:38:23.040
Osaka.

01:38:26.469 --> 01:38:27.944
Amberes.

01:38:33.481 --> 01:38:34.926
Santiago de Chile.

01:38:38.391 --> 01:38:39.790
Esteban Echeverría.

01:38:39.790 --> 01:38:40.841
Yes, great.

01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:43.516
One point for me.
Is he on my team?

01:38:43.516 --> 01:38:45.359
No, you're wrong.

01:38:45.674 --> 01:38:47.299
Do you know the game?

01:38:47.622 --> 01:38:49.043
Yeah, I got it.

01:38:49.336 --> 01:38:50.669
Shall we start again?

01:38:50.964 --> 01:38:52.048
No, let's carry on.

01:38:52.323 --> 01:38:53.407
Okay.

01:38:54.354 --> 01:38:56.479
Esteban Echeverría, where is that?

01:38:56.751 --> 01:38:58.101
Esteban Echeverría is...

01:38:58.101 --> 01:39:00.285
a town in the province
of Buenos Aires.

01:39:00.285 --> 01:39:01.705
Okay, with an "A"...

01:39:02.674 --> 01:39:03.758
Athens!

01:39:05.274 --> 01:39:06.415
Stuttgart!

01:39:06.934 --> 01:39:08.426

01:39:10.357 --> 01:39:11.504
Zanzibar.

01:39:12.545 --> 01:39:13.802
Remedios de Escalada.

01:39:14.150 --> 01:39:15.483
Abu Simbel.

01:39:15.692 --> 01:39:17.317
- Luanda.
- Amman.

01:39:17.654 --> 01:39:18.669
Nüremberg.

01:39:19.432 --> 01:39:20.504
González Catán.

01:39:20.504 --> 01:39:21.606
New York!

01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:23.151
I said it first.

01:39:23.763 --> 01:39:24.899
Hmm... Kentucky.

01:39:25.717 --> 01:39:26.884
That's a state.

01:39:27.235 --> 01:39:28.310
Yacanto.

01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:30.410
No, you've lost.
Someone else start.

01:39:30.787 --> 01:39:32.440
- You made me lose!
- Nairobi.

01:39:33.514 --> 01:39:34.521
Iguazú.

01:39:34.707 --> 01:39:35.749
Ulan Bator.

01:39:35.908 --> 01:39:36.908
Rome.

01:39:37.837 --> 01:39:38.837
Ancona.

01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:40.580
Avellaneda.

01:39:40.580 --> 01:39:41.637
Amsterdam.

01:39:41.637 --> 01:39:43.577
- Maputo.
- Oklahoma.

01:39:44.855 --> 01:39:45.897
Addis Abeba.

01:39:46.556 --> 01:39:47.660
Antananarivo.

01:39:48.966 --> 01:39:49.966
Oaxaca.

01:39:50.223 --> 01:39:51.281
Andorra la Vella.

01:39:51.498 --> 01:39:52.498
Avilés.

01:39:52.623 --> 01:39:53.623
Seattle.

01:39:54.642 --> 01:39:55.647
La Plata.

01:39:56.586 --> 01:39:57.908
Seattle, with an "e."

01:39:58.950 --> 01:40:00.367
Ok, Escobar.

01:40:01.038 --> 01:40:02.079
Rabat.

01:40:02.528 --> 01:40:03.528
Tel Aviv.

01:40:03.528 --> 01:40:04.623
Viña.

01:40:04.623 --> 01:40:06.832
Viña del Mar, the garden city.
I'm from there.

01:40:07.751 --> 01:40:08.751
With an "r."

01:40:08.856 --> 01:40:09.856
Riga.

01:40:10.354 --> 01:40:11.528
Alabama.

01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:18.178
- This way, right?
- Yes.

01:40:23.057 --> 01:40:24.653
I'll give you a ride on the motorbike.

01:40:25.165 --> 01:40:26.818
Give me your bag,
so you can travel light.

01:40:26.818 --> 01:40:27.895
Okay.

01:41:33.329 --> 01:41:34.329
Well...

01:41:35.617 --> 01:41:36.952
Thank you.

01:41:54.367 --> 01:41:55.749
Don't leave.

01:41:56.819 --> 01:41:57.824
I have to.

01:41:57.824 --> 01:41:59.857
Come on, don't leave,
stay the night.

01:42:01.009 --> 01:42:02.014
I can't.

01:42:03.102 --> 01:42:04.296
I'll go with you.

01:42:04.921 --> 01:42:05.949
No.

01:42:05.949 --> 01:42:07.708
We barely know each other.
I can't!

01:42:07.708 --> 01:42:09.679
I'll go and we'll get
to know each other.

01:42:09.792 --> 01:42:11.084
No...

01:42:21.467 --> 01:42:22.810
You're beautiful.

01:45:15.195 --> 01:45:16.320
Román...

01:45:22.396 --> 01:45:23.440
Come here.

01:45:31.667 --> 01:45:33.417
Are you going to tell me
where you were?

01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:36.310
I had to do a favor
for one of my colleagues.

01:45:37.290 --> 01:45:39.248
Yes, but you haven't
been home in two days.

01:45:41.169 --> 01:45:42.502
You could've told me.

01:45:43.050 --> 01:45:44.050
Yes, well...

01:45:44.050 --> 01:45:46.333
I've been calling you,
I couldn't get through.

01:45:46.692 --> 01:45:48.334
There was no signal.

01:45:48.334 --> 01:45:50.342
I was worried, I called everyone.

01:45:50.799 --> 01:45:53.080
- Everyone? Who did you call?
- Everyone.

01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:54.553
Everyone? Who?

01:45:54.876 --> 01:45:55.983
You called the bank?

01:45:55.983 --> 01:45:58.209
Of course I did.
It was the first place I called.

01:45:58.209 --> 01:45:59.665
What did they say?

01:46:00.239 --> 01:46:02.156
That you had called in sick.

01:46:21.207 --> 01:46:23.191
I think I need some time.

01:46:24.021 --> 01:46:25.771
I need some time on my own.

01:46:27.052 --> 01:46:28.090
Some time? Like?

01:46:28.875 --> 01:46:29.957
Some time.

01:46:32.872 --> 01:46:34.285
What do you mean with "some time"?

01:46:35.197 --> 01:46:36.442
Exactly that.

01:46:40.914 --> 01:46:41.955
How long?

01:46:43.302 --> 01:46:45.812
Some time
without seeing each other.

01:46:48.156 --> 01:46:50.591
Three days, a month, a year?

01:46:51.617 --> 01:46:52.960
A month, a year...

01:47:00.567 --> 01:47:01.864
A month or a year?

01:47:03.752 --> 01:47:04.786
I don't know.

01:47:22.590 --> 01:47:24.798
What are you going to do?
Where are you going to go?

01:47:28.270 --> 01:47:29.850
I thought of staying here.

01:47:31.626 --> 01:47:33.661
I think you're the one
who should leave.

01:49:20.611 --> 01:49:21.736
Román...

01:49:22.216 --> 01:49:24.176
- Come here, please.
- Yes.

01:49:41.290 --> 01:49:42.454
Well...

01:49:43.325 --> 01:49:45.567
We got word that you went
to the prison

01:49:45.567 --> 01:49:48.649
to visit Mr. Morán himself,
of all people?

01:49:49.889 --> 01:49:51.060
Can you explain that?

01:49:51.322 --> 01:49:52.827
Yes, I did, what's the problem?

01:49:53.703 --> 01:49:56.161
So you accept that
you are complicit on some level?

01:49:57.075 --> 01:49:58.658
Complicit? Me? Why?

01:49:59.754 --> 01:50:02.796
I went to visit a former colleague
to see how he was doing.

01:50:03.334 --> 01:50:05.376
I also wanted to ask him
why he did what he did.

01:50:05.573 --> 01:50:06.584
Is that so?

01:50:07.179 --> 01:50:08.200
And what did he say?

01:50:09.041 --> 01:50:11.189
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

01:50:12.169 --> 01:50:13.502
Look, Román...

01:50:13.949 --> 01:50:15.844
we believe that you were involved

01:50:15.844 --> 01:50:17.372
in one way or another.

01:50:18.673 --> 01:50:21.423
But we're not going to fire you
because that would mean

01:50:21.423 --> 01:50:22.949
acknowledging the robbery.

01:50:23.678 --> 01:50:26.928
Besides, we would have to pay you
a big compensation

01:50:26.928 --> 01:50:29.066
that you clearly don't deserve.

01:50:29.892 --> 01:50:31.301
So, we decided

01:50:31.301 --> 01:50:32.941
to keep you in your post.

01:50:34.380 --> 01:50:36.897
The idea is to make
your life miserable, Román.

01:50:49.609 --> 01:50:50.609
Next!

01:50:53.406 --> 01:50:54.406
ID, please.

01:51:00.106 --> 01:51:01.288
Vespucio...

01:51:01.288 --> 01:51:02.800
- Marianela.
- Yes.

01:51:03.224 --> 01:51:04.224
Here.

01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:07.991
We're to continue
helping clients on a single counter.

01:51:07.991 --> 01:51:11.606
We have new orders.

01:51:12.268 --> 01:51:13.893
You can take the day off.

01:51:15.029 --> 01:51:17.286
The day off? It's payday today.

01:51:17.286 --> 01:51:18.753
Look at the line!

01:51:19.356 --> 01:51:20.981
It's under my responsibility.

01:51:21.664 --> 01:51:22.926
Yes, but...

01:51:23.229 --> 01:51:25.868
- Two people are not enough and...
- We're at our limit...

01:51:25.868 --> 01:51:27.836
if it's just me, it's impossible.

01:51:30.912 --> 01:51:35.895
Ladies and gents, please form
a single line here at counter 5.

01:51:42.239 --> 01:51:43.364
Next.

01:51:44.089 --> 01:51:45.209
ID, please.

01:51:45.209 --> 01:51:46.268
There.

01:51:55.666 --> 01:51:56.916
No, stop, look...

01:51:56.916 --> 01:52:00.621
you entered "2, 6, 5"
instead of "5, 6, 2."

01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:03.388
The ID, see? It's "5, 6, 2."

01:52:11.740 --> 01:52:13.437
Here is your ID.

01:52:16.943 --> 01:52:19.528
Give me some space.
I can't work like this.

01:52:21.252 --> 01:52:23.252
Signature, name and ID, ma'am.

01:52:34.666 --> 01:52:35.666
Faster.

01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:52.115
Very good, it's okay.

01:52:53.217 --> 01:52:54.618
That's it, that's it.

01:54:28.273 --> 01:54:30.309
Where do we go? Your home?

01:54:31.021 --> 01:54:32.684
No, I don't have a home.

01:54:33.708 --> 01:54:35.965
- So what?
- To a hotel.

01:54:37.269 --> 01:54:38.512
I love it.

01:54:38.892 --> 01:54:40.957
We can just lie there all day.

01:54:41.362 --> 01:54:43.246
No, I have to work.

01:54:43.633 --> 01:54:46.278
- Where do you work?
- At a bank.

01:54:46.837 --> 01:54:49.942
- For how long?
- Seventeen years.

01:55:15.834 --> 01:55:17.474
Leave your bag here if you like.

01:55:17.474 --> 01:55:18.524
Ok.

01:55:29.204 --> 01:55:30.494
Nice home!

01:55:30.494 --> 01:55:31.669
Ha! Yeah.

01:55:44.728 --> 01:55:46.812
You have a nice view.
That's a school, right?

01:55:47.347 --> 01:55:48.517
It is.

01:55:54.872 --> 01:55:56.389
Well, that's it. This is it.

01:55:56.389 --> 01:55:58.239
Yeah, there's nothing more.

01:56:09.654 --> 01:56:11.303
- I like it.
- Yes.

01:56:11.303 --> 01:56:12.582
Me too.

01:56:23.832 --> 01:56:25.511
Well, what else do you need?
Nothing.

01:56:25.511 --> 01:56:27.314
Nothing at all.

01:59:39.318 --> 01:59:40.606
Are you ok?

01:59:53.974 --> 01:59:55.173
Marianela.

01:59:55.563 --> 01:59:56.607
Laura.

01:59:57.575 --> 01:59:59.783
We did what we had to do.

01:59:59.783 --> 02:00:01.792
I wanted to tell you
that I was deeply hurt

02:00:01.792 --> 02:00:03.611
by everything that happened.

02:00:03.611 --> 02:00:05.609
I understand, I'm very sorry too.

02:00:05.969 --> 02:00:07.510
Well, yes, me too.

02:00:07.782 --> 02:00:08.782
Well...

02:00:19.807 --> 02:00:22.415
- Laura!
- Del Toro, I'm leaving.

02:00:22.415 --> 02:00:23.465
Yes.

02:00:24.025 --> 02:00:27.000
As soon as I file this,
it goes into the archive.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:30.356
What are we going to do?
It's a lost cause.

02:00:30.356 --> 02:00:31.437
Indeed.

02:00:31.437 --> 02:00:34.807
Still, your work
was excellent. Many thanks.

02:00:34.925 --> 02:00:36.153
Thank you so much.

02:01:15.343 --> 02:01:16.343
Hello?

02:01:17.607 --> 02:01:18.607
Hello?

02:01:19.645 --> 02:01:20.645
Who is it?

02:01:23.171 --> 02:01:24.425
Morán, how are you?

02:01:26.843 --> 02:01:27.843
Hello.

02:01:28.117 --> 02:01:29.117
Hello.

02:01:35.495 --> 02:01:37.166
Your boyfriend is here.

02:01:43.381 --> 02:01:45.330
He's my lawyer, asshole.

02:01:51.947 --> 02:01:53.864
Come forward, counselor.

02:02:06.336 --> 02:02:07.341
What's up?

02:02:07.341 --> 02:02:08.546
You look older.

02:02:10.430 --> 02:02:12.600
- What?
- I need a favor.

02:02:12.721 --> 02:02:14.164
Go back to the hill.

02:02:14.305 --> 02:02:15.305
More money?

02:02:15.576 --> 02:02:16.576
No.

02:02:17.221 --> 02:02:19.148
I want you to get in touch
with someone.

02:02:19.812 --> 02:02:20.812
Who?

02:02:21.410 --> 02:02:22.410
A girl.

02:02:26.646 --> 02:02:28.013
Give this to her.

02:02:29.898 --> 02:02:31.898
I fell in love with her
when I was there.

02:02:33.258 --> 02:02:36.165
I think she fell in love with me too,
even more than me with her.

02:02:38.038 --> 02:02:40.928
She has black hair,
is in her forties...

02:03:06.224 --> 02:03:07.503
Which team?

02:03:07.503 --> 02:03:08.970
This one!

02:03:18.353 --> 02:03:19.980
I was told that
you have rooms for rent.

02:03:22.051 --> 02:03:23.158
I do, come in.

02:03:26.082 --> 02:03:27.082
Thank you.

02:03:34.818 --> 02:03:36.443
And how long are you staying?

02:03:37.891 --> 02:03:39.036
I'll pay for three nights.

02:03:39.354 --> 02:03:41.674
- It's $9,500.
- Okay.

02:03:42.717 --> 02:03:43.791
And the room?

02:03:44.474 --> 02:03:47.403
It's comfortable, it has a bathroom,
hot water all day long.

02:03:49.861 --> 02:03:51.759
If you're staying
you'll need pay to me upfront.

02:06:20.067 --> 02:06:21.176
Morna?

02:06:43.778 --> 02:06:45.997
Morna, could I get
some eggs for breakfast?

02:06:47.161 --> 02:06:48.203
I'm Norma.

02:06:48.687 --> 02:06:50.395
Morna is my sister.

02:06:50.562 --> 02:06:51.812
What's your name?

02:06:52.825 --> 02:06:54.740
- I'm Morán.
- Oh.

02:06:54.931 --> 02:06:56.427
Could I have some eggs then?

02:06:56.427 --> 02:06:57.477
Sure.

02:06:57.945 --> 02:06:59.528
What are you up to right now?

02:07:00.003 --> 02:07:01.003
Nothing.

02:07:01.414 --> 02:07:03.475
Could you help me, with the horse?

02:07:03.727 --> 02:07:06.285
'Cause the motorcycle broke,
and my sister is up there.

02:07:06.285 --> 02:07:07.500
Up where?

02:07:07.603 --> 02:07:09.227
There, near Romo's place.

02:07:10.036 --> 02:07:11.914
- You're not from here, right?
- No.

02:07:13.009 --> 02:07:15.102
Can you come?
We need another set of hands.

02:07:15.430 --> 02:07:17.601
- Alright. You need help?
- Yes.

02:07:18.032 --> 02:07:19.198
Hold this...

02:07:19.929 --> 02:07:21.492
and untie the horse.

02:07:24.422 --> 02:07:26.125
I know how to ride a horse.

02:07:27.211 --> 02:07:29.416
People from Buenos Aires
can't ride horses.

02:07:30.677 --> 02:07:31.812
I'm not from the city.

02:07:32.404 --> 02:07:33.445
Where are you from?

02:07:34.005 --> 02:07:35.432
I'm from Salta,
ever been there?

02:07:35.563 --> 02:07:36.580
Never been.

02:07:37.385 --> 02:07:39.103
Let's see, <i>salteño</i>, hop on!

02:07:49.321 --> 02:07:50.637
Easy, Mancha, easy!

02:07:51.579 --> 02:07:53.008
Steady Mancha, Manchita.

02:07:56.947 --> 02:07:59.218
- Where to?
- There, in that direction.

02:07:59.310 --> 02:08:00.310
Go Mancha!

02:09:09.221 --> 02:09:10.327
Battery.

02:09:16.182 --> 02:09:17.267
Done?

02:09:20.655 --> 02:09:23.494
- What were you doing?
- Recording ambient sound.

02:09:32.386 --> 02:09:34.159
Do you need anything?

02:09:34.159 --> 02:09:36.402
Yes, we need to pull focus.

02:09:37.900 --> 02:09:39.829
- First position here.
- Where?

02:09:40.388 --> 02:09:41.430
And...

02:09:41.987 --> 02:09:43.220
Over there.

02:09:43.554 --> 02:09:45.163
- Here?
- Right there, yes.

02:09:52.853 --> 02:09:53.891
Done?

02:09:55.493 --> 02:09:56.994
Stop, don't cross the...

02:10:00.353 --> 02:10:02.470
- I'm going to shoot now.
- Ok. Come on.

02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:03.896
Let me know...

02:10:04.657 --> 02:10:05.782
Stay back.

02:10:09.728 --> 02:10:12.015
- Shall we mark it?
- Morán has to walk behind you?

02:10:12.015 --> 02:10:13.986
- Where do I go?
- Yes, go here.

02:10:13.986 --> 02:10:15.676
Behind Ramón.

02:10:20.175 --> 02:10:21.206
Done?

02:10:22.670 --> 02:10:24.197
- Let's mark it.
- Fine.

02:10:24.383 --> 02:10:25.383
Morna?

02:10:25.919 --> 02:10:27.718
Which one is this? 53?

02:10:29.842 --> 02:10:31.189
Fifty-three, one.

02:10:36.628 --> 02:10:37.663
Let's see,

02:10:38.729 --> 02:10:39.963
I'll take a test shot.

02:10:40.065 --> 02:10:41.753
But then, when...

02:10:42.316 --> 02:10:43.670
You'll pan over there.

02:10:43.670 --> 02:10:46.389
I'll pan from there to here,
to the flower.

02:10:46.389 --> 02:10:49.572
I won't arrange it that much,
I'll do it when you get here.

02:10:50.584 --> 02:10:51.968
My hands are in shot.

02:10:52.172 --> 02:10:54.838
Yes, but when I get there,
that's when your hands appear.

02:10:55.284 --> 02:10:56.284
Ok.

02:10:58.652 --> 02:10:59.689
Let me know.

02:10:59.925 --> 02:11:01.770
Let's do a dry run.

02:11:02.298 --> 02:11:04.214
Shall we sing at the end?

02:11:05.192 --> 02:11:06.192
No, no.

02:11:06.456 --> 02:11:08.608
Let me see how can I get there.

02:11:08.775 --> 02:11:09.829
Wait.

02:11:11.008 --> 02:11:12.461
- There?
- That's it.

02:11:12.919 --> 02:11:15.524
Wait a bit more, I'll get there and...

02:11:16.692 --> 02:11:19.949
when the camera stops,
then we see it.

02:11:20.125 --> 02:11:21.148
Ok.

02:11:24.799 --> 02:11:26.096
Well, we're ready now.

02:11:35.017 --> 02:11:36.721
And what are you doing here?

02:11:38.164 --> 02:11:41.249
I've been looking for some land,
maybe move and live here.

02:11:43.318 --> 02:11:45.539
All the people from the city
say that.

02:11:45.951 --> 02:11:47.201
And then, they leave.

02:11:48.668 --> 02:11:50.501
I told you I'm not from the city.

02:11:53.129 --> 02:11:54.504
And who will you come with?

02:11:55.794 --> 02:11:56.794
All alone.

02:11:59.450 --> 02:12:00.777
It's tough out here.

02:12:02.321 --> 02:12:03.851
That's why I like it.

02:13:15.567 --> 02:13:16.731
How much?

02:13:16.922 --> 02:13:18.031
It's on me.

02:13:25.143 --> 02:13:26.182
Bye.

02:13:41.781 --> 02:13:44.601
It's like nature
in its purest state,

02:13:45.876 --> 02:13:47.376
without human intervention.

02:13:47.779 --> 02:13:50.868
There are kilometers
and kilometers of pastures

02:13:50.868 --> 02:13:52.419
on which suddenly,

02:13:53.290 --> 02:13:56.222
a tiny flower appears, and one asks

02:13:56.621 --> 02:13:57.621
why?

02:13:58.242 --> 02:13:59.783
Why is it there?

02:14:03.044 --> 02:14:06.687
Some approaches to gardening
attempt to imitate

02:14:06.982 --> 02:14:08.527
all that, that surprise.

02:14:09.062 --> 02:14:10.812
I think of English gardens.

02:14:11.653 --> 02:14:12.653
They have...

02:14:12.954 --> 02:14:17.671
even when they are man-handled,
with gardeners in charge,

02:14:17.896 --> 02:14:20.189
they try to pretend they're unkempt.

02:14:20.189 --> 02:14:23.407
As if there were no intervention,
just nature abandoned to itself.

02:14:23.794 --> 02:14:26.669
It's a much more melancholic
and romantic garden.

02:14:27.576 --> 02:14:29.778
Another concept, right?
It tries...

02:14:30.193 --> 02:14:32.405
At the same time, this is a reaction...

02:14:34.306 --> 02:14:36.251
to French gardening,

02:14:36.251 --> 02:14:38.122
which is gardening

02:14:38.305 --> 02:14:40.028
prior to the Revolution.

02:14:40.150 --> 02:14:44.025
The King, at the Versailles palace,
with all his...

02:14:45.375 --> 02:14:47.041
symmetrical gardens,

02:14:47.041 --> 02:14:48.374
geometrical.

02:14:48.659 --> 02:14:51.193
Right? Like the concept of <i>parterre</i>,

02:14:53.221 --> 02:14:56.166
of having a place where
you can see the whole garden.

02:14:56.465 --> 02:14:57.790
Having control,

02:14:57.790 --> 02:14:59.382
control over nature.

02:15:00.602 --> 02:15:04.436
Different to what we see here.
For me here is more...

02:15:04.603 --> 02:15:08.208
in line with the Japanese garden,
which is more austere.

02:15:08.477 --> 02:15:10.143
Also because of the mountain,

02:15:10.342 --> 02:15:11.825
the importance of the stones,

02:15:11.825 --> 02:15:15.415
which have a sacred value
for Japanese gardening.

02:15:15.415 --> 02:15:17.169
They are some kind

02:15:18.125 --> 02:15:20.036
of representation of the mountain.

02:15:21.207 --> 02:15:22.519
Ramón is a filmmaker.

02:15:23.192 --> 02:15:24.199
Videomaker.

02:15:24.646 --> 02:15:26.877
Film as such is dead.

02:15:28.028 --> 02:15:30.239
He is the best videomaker around.

02:15:30.823 --> 02:15:32.689
I am also the only one.

02:15:33.291 --> 02:15:36.681
We've been making a video
of all this for about two years.

02:15:37.407 --> 02:15:39.016
It is a film.

02:15:39.482 --> 02:15:43.220
Well, he's a videomaker
that makes films, not videos.

02:15:43.675 --> 02:15:45.911
Format doesn't matter,
they are films.

02:15:46.021 --> 02:15:48.188
But didn't you say
that film is dead?

02:15:49.592 --> 02:15:51.467
Maybe it didn't completely die.

02:15:56.716 --> 02:15:58.442
Well, we're off.

02:15:59.413 --> 02:16:01.499
- Can you take my things?
- Ok.

02:16:02.367 --> 02:16:04.155
Take the flashlight.

02:16:05.086 --> 02:16:06.719
Give them your stuff.

02:16:11.634 --> 02:16:12.788
Have a good time.

02:16:16.407 --> 02:16:18.392
Well, let's go home.

02:16:18.971 --> 02:16:20.212
- See you.
- Bye.

02:16:20.212 --> 02:16:22.263
- Bye.
- Grab the mare.

02:16:23.121 --> 02:16:24.121
What?

02:16:24.447 --> 02:16:25.447
Okay.

02:16:27.632 --> 02:16:29.199
Norma, tell me about you.

02:16:29.509 --> 02:16:31.681
About your life,
if you have a boyfriend.

02:16:32.634 --> 02:16:33.634
Boyfriend?

02:16:33.922 --> 02:16:35.665
Who told you I have a boyfriend?

02:16:36.325 --> 02:16:37.867
No one, just asking.

02:16:39.737 --> 02:16:41.556
And why do you ask that?

02:16:41.556 --> 02:16:43.400
You like gossip, <i>salteño</i>.

02:16:44.638 --> 02:16:46.040
Just making conversation.

02:16:47.908 --> 02:16:49.642
No, let's not talk.

02:17:19.839 --> 02:17:21.838
Where would you build your home?

02:17:22.303 --> 02:17:24.645
I like it there, up there, see?

02:17:30.674 --> 02:17:32.291
You'd come and live here?

02:17:33.395 --> 02:17:34.746
Yes, with you.

02:17:38.807 --> 02:17:40.081
Let's get married Norma.

02:17:40.853 --> 02:17:42.745
- What?
- Let's get married.

02:17:43.469 --> 02:17:44.489
Live together.

02:17:44.812 --> 02:17:46.280
But we haven't even kissed!

02:17:46.407 --> 02:17:47.740
Let's kiss then.

02:18:30.156 --> 02:18:31.337
Sage.

02:18:38.691 --> 02:18:40.127
There's rosemary here.

02:18:40.462 --> 02:18:41.462
Good.

02:18:42.041 --> 02:18:43.477
I won't work anymore.

02:18:45.219 --> 02:18:46.640
How come?

02:18:46.923 --> 02:18:48.979
I want to live like this, like you.

02:18:49.728 --> 02:18:50.812
But I work.

02:18:50.964 --> 02:18:53.945
I mean, I want
to work like you, with plenty of time.

02:18:57.058 --> 02:18:59.422
If you and your sister
don't have any work, you don't work.

02:18:59.598 --> 02:19:01.453
Instead, if I don't have work to do,

02:19:01.453 --> 02:19:02.714
I still have to go to work.

02:19:03.414 --> 02:19:05.411
I have to wake up at the same time,

02:19:05.712 --> 02:19:07.101
wear the same clothes,

02:19:07.556 --> 02:19:08.859
take the same subway.

02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:12.806
Do exactly the same
as the day before,

02:19:13.005 --> 02:19:15.380
surrounded by the same people.

02:19:29.713 --> 02:19:31.048
Where do you work?

02:19:35.594 --> 02:19:37.400
I clock in every day.

02:19:38.818 --> 02:19:40.013
And for what?

02:19:41.203 --> 02:19:42.724
To pay for the apartment,

02:19:43.294 --> 02:19:44.864
buy a suit once in a while,

02:19:45.766 --> 02:19:47.021
a new shirt,

02:19:48.867 --> 02:19:50.532
get the newest cell phone,

02:19:52.641 --> 02:19:55.070
save money to take 15 days off...

02:19:56.130 --> 02:19:57.395
Fifteen days per year!

02:19:57.840 --> 02:19:59.793
Fifteen out of 365 days.

02:20:03.124 --> 02:20:05.558
To have spare time,
supposedly spare because...

02:20:06.022 --> 02:20:08.020
you go to a beach and
you find the same people

02:20:08.020 --> 02:20:10.016
that you meet on the subway
the rest of the year.

02:20:23.602 --> 02:20:25.235
We live only to work.

02:20:30.891 --> 02:20:33.364
When you meet someone
in the city for the first time,

02:20:33.883 --> 02:20:35.008
what do they ask?

02:20:36.304 --> 02:20:37.531
What's your job?

02:20:38.864 --> 02:20:40.192
That is why I don't want to work.

02:20:40.192 --> 02:20:41.835
I want to live like you.

02:24:59.501 --> 02:25:00.501
Steady.

02:25:01.140 --> 02:25:02.173
Right,

02:25:02.173 --> 02:25:03.224
sound, roll.

02:25:06.443 --> 02:25:07.443
There.

02:25:08.348 --> 02:25:09.374
Let's go.

02:25:10.923 --> 02:25:14.071
Fifty-five, one, one.

02:25:18.455 --> 02:25:19.455
Action!

02:25:28.305 --> 02:25:30.719
Come over here! Over here!

02:25:37.884 --> 02:25:39.079
Do I have to turn?

02:25:39.079 --> 02:25:40.306
No, stay there.

02:25:42.279 --> 02:25:43.279
Cut!

02:25:44.930 --> 02:25:45.938
Done?

02:25:46.322 --> 02:25:47.322
Yes!

02:26:02.216 --> 02:26:03.966
Shall I come with you, Ramón?

02:26:05.178 --> 02:26:06.224
As you want.

02:26:08.336 --> 02:26:09.359
Norma?

02:26:10.284 --> 02:26:11.455
Shall I come with you?

02:26:11.455 --> 02:26:12.647
Yes, come.

02:26:13.903 --> 02:26:15.488
We're going there.

02:26:17.747 --> 02:26:19.325
- Here is fine.
- Huh?

02:26:19.613 --> 02:26:20.790
Here is fine.

02:26:26.071 --> 02:26:27.899
The sun is setting.

02:26:34.110 --> 02:26:35.801
We'll see what we can do.

02:26:39.693 --> 02:26:41.294
So? What do you think?

02:26:42.158 --> 02:26:45.208
- About the sunset?
- A panoramic shot...

Hi girls!

02:29:25.518 --> 02:29:26.571
Come in!

02:29:45.818 --> 02:29:46.825
Look.

02:29:59.781 --> 02:30:01.572
I'll come live here.

02:30:03.990 --> 02:30:05.623
We'll have a life together, Normita.

02:30:45.424 --> 02:30:46.424
Hey!

02:30:46.957 --> 02:30:48.173
What are you doing?

02:30:49.946 --> 02:30:51.079
Sorry.

02:30:51.079 --> 02:30:52.415
I'm leaving.

02:30:53.025 --> 02:30:55.203
How so, leaving? Right now?

02:30:56.333 --> 02:30:58.572
Yes, I can't stay anymore.
I've got to go.

02:31:04.229 --> 02:31:05.552
Take the record, please.

02:31:09.778 --> 02:31:12.103
If you play track eight
you'll remember me.

02:32:04.841 --> 02:32:06.200
What is it?

02:32:06.719 --> 02:32:07.825
Nothing.

02:32:41.682 --> 02:32:42.705
Are you ok?

02:32:42.922 --> 02:32:44.088
Yeah, everything's fine.

02:33:11.526 --> 02:33:12.720
I'll be right back.

02:33:33.853 --> 02:33:35.580
I didn't like Buenos Aires.

02:33:36.447 --> 02:33:37.947
Buenos Aires is great!

02:33:39.459 --> 02:33:40.627
I didn't like it.

02:33:41.329 --> 02:33:42.740
But what did you visit?

02:33:43.664 --> 02:33:44.733
The movie theater,

02:33:44.733 --> 02:33:45.783
the obelisk...

02:33:46.497 --> 02:33:47.832
But that's nothing!

02:33:48.320 --> 02:33:49.848
There are beautiful neighborhoods.

02:33:50.057 --> 02:33:51.424
Life at the hotel...

02:33:52.140 --> 02:33:54.313
Well, we have a lot to do here.

02:33:57.049 --> 02:33:58.210
I'm going back.

02:33:59.544 --> 02:34:00.915
But you just got here!

02:34:03.283 --> 02:34:06.546
You have a life here, a job,
I have nothing to do.

02:34:08.911 --> 02:34:10.286
So why did you come?

02:34:12.023 --> 02:34:13.296
To see what it was like.

02:34:14.974 --> 02:34:16.179
I got you a present.

02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:36.426
Do you like it?

02:34:39.622 --> 02:34:40.986
I have to tell you something.

02:34:48.130 --> 02:34:49.130
<i>Norma,</i>

02:34:49.625 --> 02:34:51.442
<i>I think about you every day.</i>

02:34:52.579 --> 02:34:55.746
<i>I know it hasn't been long,
but every day without you was endless</i>.

02:34:56.700 --> 02:34:58.317
<i>As I said in Alpa Corral</i>,

02:34:58.418 --> 02:35:00.083
<i>I'll go back to look for you</i>,

02:35:00.083 --> 02:35:03.119
<i>we're going to marry and
have a house at the hill</i>.

02:35:03.887 --> 02:35:05.365
<i>A friend, Román</i>,

02:35:06.056 --> 02:35:08.098
<i>whom I trust, gave you this letter</i>.

02:35:08.502 --> 02:35:10.793
<i>Don't ask him questions.
He knows nothing</i>.

02:35:10.912 --> 02:35:12.486
<i>He doesn't know I love you</i>,

02:35:12.486 --> 02:35:14.980
<i>or that I will be back for you
in three and a half years</i>.

02:35:14.980 --> 02:35:17.005
<i>Well, less than three, actually</i>.

02:35:17.627 --> 02:35:19.992
<i>Less than three, Norma,
don't you see?</i>

02:35:20.345 --> 02:35:21.866
<i>Time flies</i>.

02:35:22.687 --> 02:35:23.947
<i>I miss you, Norma</i>.

02:35:24.212 --> 02:35:26.026
<i>You're the woman of my life</i>.

02:35:26.894 --> 02:35:28.202
<i>I want us to have kids</i>.

02:35:28.202 --> 02:35:29.585
<i>Three, four</i>...

02:35:29.697 --> 02:35:30.697
<i>maybe a dog,</i>

02:35:30.783 --> 02:35:32.351
<i>and two horses
to go to the mountains</i>

02:35:32.351 --> 02:35:33.884
<i>and then swim in the creek</i>.

02:35:34.510 --> 02:35:36.299
<i>I know that this may seem odd</i>,

02:35:37.036 --> 02:35:39.768
<i>I went away and told you
that I'd be back in three years</i>.

02:35:40.368 --> 02:35:42.239
<i>Well, it's already less time.</i>

02:35:42.572 --> 02:35:43.674
<i>Think of it this way</i>,

02:35:43.986 --> 02:35:46.396
<i>soon the three years will be over,</i>

02:35:46.853 --> 02:35:50.087
<i>and we will be together, loving
each another, with a beautiful life</i>.

02:35:51.336 --> 02:35:52.501
<i>I love you very much</i>.

02:35:53.190 --> 02:35:54.190
<i>Morán</i>."

02:35:59.797 --> 02:36:00.797
And what about you?

02:36:02.331 --> 02:36:04.521
I kept the money
when he stole it.

02:36:05.736 --> 02:36:07.146
All in exchange for a percentage,

02:36:07.146 --> 02:36:09.720
a small percentage, by the way.

02:36:10.656 --> 02:36:12.322
Yes, but he's in jail!

02:36:13.056 --> 02:36:16.501
Three and a half years in jail
or twenty at the bank. He chose.

02:36:20.260 --> 02:36:21.713
Your friend is nuts.

02:36:22.196 --> 02:36:23.258
He or I?

02:36:25.103 --> 02:36:26.648
Don't be ridiculous.

02:36:28.859 --> 02:36:30.194
I want to be with you.

02:36:30.457 --> 02:36:31.623
And so does your friend.

02:36:32.724 --> 02:36:34.281
Look, I've left everything.

02:36:34.830 --> 02:36:37.497
I left my girlfriend, my house,
everything, to be with you.

02:36:39.107 --> 02:36:40.384
You're pathetic.

02:36:40.946 --> 02:36:42.345
And your friend is a lunatic.

02:36:43.607 --> 02:36:44.617
Let me go.

02:36:45.140 --> 02:36:46.140
Let me go!

02:37:32.849 --> 02:37:35.690
- Hi.
- Hello.

02:37:47.270 --> 02:37:48.980
You know what these are, right?

02:37:49.130 --> 02:37:50.153
Books.

02:37:51.513 --> 02:37:52.934
Have you read any books?

02:37:54.648 --> 02:37:55.692
The Bible.

02:37:55.906 --> 02:37:57.625
Nah, the Bible is not a book.

02:37:58.662 --> 02:38:00.810
The Bible is

02:38:00.810 --> 02:38:02.632
a science fiction book.

02:38:03.533 --> 02:38:05.036
Written by a lot of people.

02:38:10.414 --> 02:38:11.538
"<i>The engine</i>

02:38:11.765 --> 02:38:13.281
"<i>lights up the immense salt</i>,

02:38:14.179 --> 02:38:16.264
"<i>the blocks of salt on the sides</i>,

02:38:16.593 --> 02:38:19.296
"<i>the weeds mixed with salt

02:38:20.292 --> 02:38:21.779
"<i>I waver... and hush</i>...

02:38:22.395 --> 02:38:24.593
"<i>because I'm thinking
about the freight trains</i>

02:38:24.593 --> 02:38:26.936
"<i>that run at night
through the Great Salt Flat</i>.

02:38:27.828 --> 02:38:30.944
"<i>The word "mystery" should be crushed,
as one crushes a flea,</i>

02:38:32.457 --> 02:38:33.699
"<i>with both thumbs</i>.

02:38:33.971 --> 02:38:35.887
"<i>The word "mystery"
explains nothing, no more</i>.

02:38:37.307 --> 02:38:40.119
"<i>Mystery is nothing and
nothingness does not explain itself.</i>

02:38:40.681 --> 02:38:42.868
"<i>The word 'mystery' should be replaced</i>

02:38:43.270 --> 02:38:44.442
"<i>at least for today</i>,

02:38:44.825 --> 02:38:47.082
"<i>at least for this poem</i>,

02:38:47.408 --> 02:38:48.754
"<i>for what I feel</i>

02:38:49.082 --> 02:38:50.892
"<i>when I think about the freight trains</i>

02:38:50.892 --> 02:38:52.070
"<i>that run at night</i>

02:38:52.574 --> 02:38:54.027

02:39:01.778 --> 02:39:04.012
"<i>The pear clatters on the plate</i>.

02:39:05.575 --> 02:39:07.874
"<i>The honey despairs
in the closed jar</i>,

02:39:08.421 --> 02:39:10.389
"<i>to much despair of the flies</i>

02:39:10.939 --> 02:39:13.108
"<i>that stalk it,
perched on the glass</i>.

02:39:14.516 --> 02:39:15.845
"<i>But I can't explain</i>,

02:39:15.845 --> 02:39:18.010
"<i>and so far nobody could,</i>

<i>Everything clatters</i>."

02:39:34.972 --> 02:39:36.267
What's "clatter"?

02:39:36.978 --> 02:39:38.985
The poem, at this point,

02:39:38.985 --> 02:39:41.439
is taking place on a train
and everything moves, see?

02:39:44.158 --> 02:39:45.241
"<i>Everything clatters</i>.

02:39:46.473 --> 02:39:47.747
"<i>Everything quivers</i>.

02:40:36.570 --> 02:40:39.695
"<i>We nervously flicked
on and off our flashlights</i>

02:40:40.236 --> 02:40:42.334
"<i>until we ran out of batteries</i>.

02:40:43.142 --> 02:40:44.700
"<i>I can't either explain why</i>

02:40:44.700 --> 02:40:46.283
"<i>I dream of flashlight batteries</i>,

02:40:46.992 --> 02:40:48.939
"<i>with batteries for transistor radios.</i>.

02:40:49.839 --> 02:40:51.806
"<i>Nor why I dream of light bulbs</i>,

02:40:52.190 --> 02:40:55.008
"<i>delicately stored
in their respective boxes</i>.

02:40:56.549 --> 02:40:57.550
"<i>Nor why</i>

02:40:57.550 --> 02:40:59.684
"<i>I have caught myself
staring at the broken filament</i>

02:40:59.684 --> 02:41:01.296
"<i>of a burnt-out light bulb.</i>

02:41:02.351 --> 02:41:03.530
"<i>I've never seen</i>,

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:05.042
"<i>I never could imagine</i>

02:41:05.208 --> 02:41:07.172
"<i>rain falling on the Great Salt Flat</i>.

02:41:09.041 --> 02:41:10.961
"<i>I don't have objectives but I like</i>

02:41:14.054 --> 02:41:15.054
"<i>to be objective</i>.

02:41:15.630 --> 02:41:17.963
"<i>Since I was a child I tried
to cut a drop of water in two</i>

02:41:17.963 --> 02:41:19.013
"<i>with scissors</i>.

02:41:19.620 --> 02:41:20.776
"<i>Even now, I try</i>,

02:41:21.375 --> 02:41:24.408
"<i>pushing things away from the table
or frightening friends away</i>,

02:41:24.684 --> 02:41:27.309
"<i>to imitate, to imagine,
rain on the Great Salt Flat.</i>.

02:41:28.836 --> 02:41:32.236
"<i>And now I question myself
as if imprisoned and testifying:</i>

02:41:33.125 --> 02:41:36.218
"<i>The Great Salt Flat or Great Salt Lake
is in north Córdoba</i>,

02:41:36.599 --> 02:41:37.617
"<i>nearby,</i>

02:41:37.817 --> 02:41:39.308
"<i>or within, I don't remember</i>,

02:41:39.630 --> 02:41:41.582
"<i>the border with Santiago del Estero</i>.

02:41:43.109 --> 02:41:44.207
"<i>I'm looking at the map</i>...

02:41:44.207 --> 02:41:45.624
"<i>but that explains nothing</i>.

02:41:46.293 --> 02:41:48.751
"<i>The matchbox is empty
by four in the morning,</i>

02:41:48.751 --> 02:41:51.218
"<i>and I feel myself, desperate,</i>

02:41:51.971 --> 02:41:53.494
"<i>with the cigarette in my mouth</i>...

02:41:54.216 --> 02:41:56.550
"<i>'Fire should be invented, '
some would think.</i>

02:41:57.351 --> 02:41:59.496
"<i>I, instead, think about
the glints of the train</i>

02:41:59.750 --> 02:42:01.833
"<i>that runs at night
by the Salado River.</i>

02:42:02.714 --> 02:42:03.880
"<i>I can't sleep</i>

02:42:04.062 --> 02:42:05.395
"<i>when traveling at night</i>

02:42:05.820 --> 02:42:07.778
"<i>I know that I have to my right
the Salado River.</i>

02:42:08.934 --> 02:42:11.934
"<i>But even so I'm still escaping
the great mystery...</i>

02:42:12.667 --> 02:42:15.433
"<i>the mystery of the endless salt
of the Great Salt Flat</i>.

02:42:16.958 --> 02:42:20.086
"<i>I remember when we hurled
sucked oranges with impunity</i>

02:42:20.086 --> 02:42:22.663
"<i>into the blind, blinding mirror</i>

02:42:22.875 --> 02:42:24.140
"<i>of the Great Salt Flat</i>,

02:42:26.382 --> 02:42:27.673
"<i>in the afternoons,</i>

02:42:27.824 --> 02:42:29.616
"<i>when glare blinds</i>

02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:32.135
"<i>more than the sun.</i>

02:42:32.424 --> 02:42:34.508
"<i>We expected to arrive
in Tucumán at seven</i>

02:42:34.908 --> 02:42:37.074
"<i>and at two we had to change a wheel</i>

02:42:39.192 --> 02:42:40.597
"<i>by the Great Salt Flat</i>.

02:42:41.065 --> 02:42:42.917
"<i>A newspaper flew through the air,</i>

02:42:43.458 --> 02:42:46.720
"<i>the sun scorched
the crumpled news of the world</i>

02:42:47.074 --> 02:42:49.574
"<i>of the newspaper
that fell on the Great Salt Flat</i>.

02:42:51.049 --> 02:42:53.716
"<i>And I saw several trains go by
and even a jet.</i>

02:42:54.625 --> 02:42:56.470
"<i>The passengers of the Caravelles</i>

02:42:56.754 --> 02:42:58.267
"<i>or the Back One-Elevens,</i>

02:42:58.583 --> 02:43:00.519
"<i>don't know that that bluish spot,</i>

02:43:01.095 --> 02:43:03.564
"<i>that they may be seeing
at this very moment,</i>

02:43:03.775 --> 02:43:05.543
"<i>from eight thousand meters high,</i>

02:43:05.916 --> 02:43:09.134
"<i>that bluish stain
that remains for a few minutes,</i>

02:43:09.715 --> 02:43:11.095
"<i>is The Great Salt Flat</i>.

02:43:11.829 --> 02:43:13.126
"<i>The Great Salt Lake</i>."

02:43:33.587 --> 02:43:34.587
Román.

02:43:35.439 --> 02:43:36.460
It's me.

02:43:38.075 --> 02:43:39.083
It's time.

02:43:59.310 --> 02:44:00.310
Morán!

02:44:01.084 --> 02:44:02.232
Your time is up.

02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:14.691
Good luck.

02:44:15.129 --> 02:44:16.923
This is to share with the guys.

02:44:17.379 --> 02:44:19.417
- Okay.
- Maybe you learn something, huh!

02:44:20.380 --> 02:44:22.488
Thanks, good luck!

02:44:39.128 --> 02:44:40.502
Signature, name

02:44:40.502 --> 02:44:41.879
and left thumb print.

02:45:06.255 --> 02:45:07.255
Thanks.

02:48:52.627 --> 02:48:53.720
Flor.

02:48:58.746 --> 02:48:59.746
Flor!

02:49:01.787 --> 02:49:02.957
I need to talk to you.

02:49:06.181 --> 02:49:07.496
I'm teaching.

02:49:07.780 --> 02:49:09.056
- Sorry.
- What is it?

02:49:09.996 --> 02:49:11.001
I have to leave.

02:49:13.386 --> 02:49:14.448
Where to?

02:49:15.798 --> 02:49:16.798
On a trip.

02:49:17.089 --> 02:49:18.200
With this?

02:49:18.200 --> 02:49:20.595
Can I have a glass of water
before my mom comes?

02:49:23.063 --> 02:49:24.345
Are you taking the tent?

02:49:24.572 --> 02:49:25.892
And the sleeping bag?

02:49:29.972 --> 02:49:30.987
Where are you going?

02:49:32.153 --> 02:49:33.521
I'll be back in two days.

02:49:33.696 --> 02:49:35.719
- Where are you going?
- Can I have another?

02:49:44.279 --> 02:49:46.404
I need to do a favor
for a colleague from the bank.

02:49:46.656 --> 02:49:47.656
Who?

02:49:47.656 --> 02:49:49.158
Can I have another?

02:49:50.891 --> 02:49:51.891
Who?

02:49:55.724 --> 02:49:56.754
What will you do?

02:49:57.694 --> 02:49:58.865
You're skipping work?

02:49:58.865 --> 02:50:00.219
What day is it today?
Thursday?

02:50:02.343 --> 02:50:03.608
How will you manage?

02:50:04.238 --> 02:50:05.238
Thanks.

02:50:15.810 --> 02:50:17.020
I quit.
