WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.475
KEITH MOVED IN WITH BREE.

00:04.475 --> 00:07.038
SUSAN CAME TO GRIPS
WITH HER FUTURE.

00:07.038 --> 00:09.640
DIALYSIS UNTIL
THEY FIND ME A DONOR.

00:09.640 --> 00:12.313
WELL, THAT WON'T
TAKE VERY LONG, WILL IT?
 THREE TO FIVE YEARS.

00:12.313 --> 00:16.015
IN GRIEF OVER LOSING
HER BIOLOGICAL DAUGHTER...

00:16.015 --> 00:18.449
GRACE NO LONGER EXISTS,
AND THAT IS THE LAST TIME

00:18.449 --> 00:21.092
YOU WILL MENTION HER NAME
IN THIS HOUSE!

00:21.092 --> 00:24.155
GABY SOUGHT COMFORT
FROM AN UNUSUAL SOURCE.

00:24.155 --> 00:27.728
AND THERE WERE
SOME SURPRISES...
 SOMEBODY LOSE A GUN?

00:27.728 --> 00:31.162
INCLUDING A LONG LOST SON...

00:31.162 --> 00:33.033
YOU DIDN'T MENTION
YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW.
 MY MOTHER-IN-LAW?

00:33.033 --> 00:35.406
AND A SHOCKING REVELATION
FOR PAUL.

00:35.406 --> 00:38.109
FELICIA TILLMAN HAS GONE
TO SOME EXTRAORDINARY LENGTHS

00:38.109 --> 00:39.410
TO CAUSE YOU HARM.

00:43.614 --> 00:46.647
(Mary Alice) PAUL YOUNG
HAD MADE A DISCOVERY--

00:46.647 --> 00:50.121
HIS WIFE WAS A LIAR.

00:50.121 --> 00:54.155
SHE HAD LIED WITH EVERY SMILE,

00:54.155 --> 00:57.188
WITH EVERY CARESS,

00:57.188 --> 01:00.831
AND WITH EVERY KISS.

01:00.831 --> 01:03.364
YES, PAUL NOW KNEW

01:03.364 --> 01:06.066
THEIR ENTIRE MARRIAGE
WAS A FRAUD.

01:06.066 --> 01:09.800
THE ONLY THING
HE DIDN'T KNOW...

01:09.800 --> 01:12.173
HEY THERE.

01:12.173 --> 01:15.406
WAS HOW HE WOULD PUNISH HER.

01:15.406 --> 01:16.747
YOU'RE PACKING?

01:16.747 --> 01:19.079
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
COMING HOME UNTIL TOMORROW.

01:19.079 --> 01:22.213
I TALKED THE DOCTOR
INTO LETTING ME OUT EARLY.

01:22.213 --> 01:25.186
I'M GLAD. (sighs)
I REALLY NEED YOU RIGHT NOW.

01:25.186 --> 01:28.259
THINGS ON THE STREET HAVE BEEN
GETTING VERY STRANGE.

01:28.259 --> 01:31.262
BETH, THINGS ON THAT STREET
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY STRANGE.

01:31.262 --> 01:33.194
WELL, YES, BUT...

01:35.166 --> 01:37.468
REMEMBER I TOLD YOU
HOW BREE WAS INVITING ME OVER

01:37.468 --> 01:41.101
FOR DRINKS
WITH THE OTHER WOMEN?
 AND I TOLD YOU NOT TO GO.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.603
WELL, I SHOULD'VE LISTENED.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.835
TURNS OUT
THEY'RE TRYING TO FRAME ME.

01:44.835 --> 01:46.837
FRAME YOU?

01:46.837 --> 01:48.339
WHILE I WAS THERE,

01:48.339 --> 01:51.882
I FOUND A GUN
UNDER MY SOFA CUSHION.

01:51.882 --> 01:54.145
IT WAS A .38--

01:54.145 --> 01:56.517
THE SAME CALIBER THE POLICE
SAID YOU WERE SHOT WITH.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.519
THEY MUST'VE
PLANTED IT THERE.

01:58.519 --> 02:01.422
AND THE GUN
JUST MAGICALLY APPEARED?
 YES.

02:01.422 --> 02:04.425
I'M SURE BREE'S GOING TO
TURN IT OVER TO THE POLICE,

02:04.425 --> 02:07.158
AND THEY'RE GOING TO THINK
 I SHOT YOU.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.832
BETH...

02:11.832 --> 02:15.206
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT WHAT ANYONE ELSE THINKS.

02:15.206 --> 02:17.238
I KNOW THE TRUTH.

02:18.809 --> 02:21.141
HEY, HERE'S AN IDEA.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.143
WHY DON'T WE TAKE A TRIP?

02:23.143 --> 02:24.915
A TRIP?

02:24.915 --> 02:26.917
WE NEED TO GET AWAY.

02:26.917 --> 02:30.581
WE'LL GO SOMEWHERE...
SECLUDED.

02:30.581 --> 02:32.223
OHH. (sighs)

02:32.223 --> 02:34.225
THAT SOUNDS LIKE HEAVEN.

02:35.426 --> 02:37.157
YES...

02:37.157 --> 02:40.331
PAUL HAD NO CHOICE
BUT TO PUNISH HIS WIFE...

02:40.331 --> 02:42.763
I LOVE YOU.

02:42.763 --> 02:45.336
BECAUSE SOME LIES...

02:45.336 --> 02:58.379
ARE UNFORGIVEABLE.

02:58.379 --> 03:02.553
WE ARE REMINDED EVERY SPRING...

03:02.553 --> 03:06.217
WITH EVERY ROSE THAT BLOOMS,

03:06.217 --> 03:10.291
WITH EVERY SUNFLOWER
THAT BLOSSOMS,

03:10.291 --> 03:14.695
WITH EVERY LILY THAT BUDS.

03:14.695 --> 03:19.770
THE WORLD
IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.

03:19.770 --> 03:24.935
SADLY, IT IS FILLED WITH PEOPLE
WHO DO UGLY THINGS...

03:28.239 --> 03:30.741
CONSTANTLY.

03:30.741 --> 03:33.814
(doorbell ringing)

03:33.814 --> 03:34.915
(ringing stops)

03:34.915 --> 03:37.448
THAT WOMAN WHO JUST
DROVE AWAY--WHO WAS SHE?

03:37.448 --> 03:39.219
UH... A FRIEND.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.722
YOU'RE FRIENDS
WITH BARBARA FAIRCHILD,

03:41.722 --> 03:43.924
THE INTERIOR DESIGNER?

03:43.924 --> 03:44.925
BOB?

03:44.925 --> 03:47.758
OR SHOULD I SAY,
THE INFERIOR DESIGNER?

03:49.630 --> 03:51.001
HEY, RENEE.

03:51.001 --> 03:53.003
HOW COULD YOU HIRE
BARBARA FAIRCHILD

03:53.003 --> 03:56.006
WHEN YOU KNOW I JUST STARTED
MY OWN INTERIOR DESIGN FIRM?

03:56.006 --> 03:58.238
UH... WE'RE NOT HIRING HER.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.371
OH?
WHY YOU HOLDING SWATCHES?

04:02.643 --> 04:04.945
AND PEOPLE THINK
 YOU'RE THE SMART ONE.

04:04.945 --> 04:07.648
LOOK, YOU KNOW
WE JUST ADOPTED A LITTLE GIRL.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.950
WELL, WE HIRED BARBARA
TO DECORATE HER ROOM.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.523
WELL, WHY NOT HIRE ME?
 YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY MATERNAL.

04:12.523 --> 04:14.985
WE--WE WANTED THIS ROOM
TO BE PINK AND NURTURING,

04:14.985 --> 04:18.428
AND YOUR STYLE SEEMS MORE LIKE
CHROME AND GLASS AND...

04:18.428 --> 04:20.661
TEETH.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.893
LOOK WHO'S BACK
TO BEING THE SMART ONE.

04:22.893 --> 04:25.596
LOOK, FAIRCHILD IS A HACK.
WHATEVER SHE QUOTED YOU,

04:25.596 --> 04:27.998
I'LL COME IN 2 DAYS EARLIER
AND 20% CHEAPER.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.303
BARBARA IS KIND OF EXPENSIVE.
 DONE.

04:32.303 --> 04:35.045
I'LL GET STARTED RIGHT AWAY.

04:35.045 --> 04:37.608
JUST SO YOU KNOW, OUR DAUGHTER
GETS HERE IN A WEEK.

04:37.608 --> 04:41.852
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW, I'M
AS MATERNAL AS THE NEXT WOMAN.

04:43.414 --> 04:45.386
GABY?

04:45.386 --> 04:47.388
HI, HONEY.
YOU WANT SOME LUNCH?

04:47.388 --> 04:50.821
NO, I WANT AN EXPLANATION.
I JUST GOT OUR CREDIT CARD BILL.

04:50.821 --> 04:54.595
$840 AT MISS CHARLOTTE'S
DOLL ACADEMY?

04:54.595 --> 04:56.627
DID I SAY LUNCH?

04:56.627 --> 04:59.069
I MEANT SEX.
DO YOU WANT SOME SEX?

04:59.069 --> 05:01.472
WHY ARE YOU BUYING OUR KIDS
FANCY TOYS?

05:01.472 --> 05:03.774
LAST WEEK,
JUANITA USED HER DOLL'S LEG

05:03.774 --> 05:05.976
TO SCRAPE PEANUT BUTTER
OUT OF THE JAR.

05:05.976 --> 05:08.579
(sighs) OKAY, THE DOLL
WASN'T FOR JUANITA.

05:08.579 --> 05:10.310
IT'S FOR...
 (paper rustles)

05:10.310 --> 05:13.444
BOB AND LEE, FOR THE LITTLE GIRL
THEY'RE ADOPTING.

05:13.444 --> 05:15.516
YOU SPENT $800 ON A GIFT?

05:15.516 --> 05:18.519
IT MADE ME FEEL GOOD, OKAY?
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN WEEKS,

05:18.519 --> 05:20.721
I'M NOT STAYING IN BED
TILL 2:00 IN THE AFTERNOON

05:20.721 --> 05:22.923
OR STAYING UP ALL NIGHT
SOBBING.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.626
SO I WENT A LITTLE CRAZY
ON THE CREDIT CARD.

05:25.626 --> 05:28.098
JUST LET ME BE HAPPY.
 BUT $800?!

05:28.098 --> 05:30.100
CARLOS, IF YOU GET
THIS WORKED UP NOW,

05:30.100 --> 05:32.102
YOU'LL HAVE NO PLACE TO GO

05:32.102 --> 05:34.465
WHEN THE BILL
FOR THE PLATINUM CARD COMES IN.

05:36.006 --> 05:38.108
(sighs)

05:38.108 --> 05:40.771
UH, EXCUSE ME? HI.

05:40.771 --> 05:43.013
I'M LOOKING FOR KEITH WATSON.

05:43.013 --> 05:45.376
HIS ROOMMATE TOLD ME
HE MOVED HERE.

05:45.376 --> 05:48.078
UH, YES, BUT HE'S NOT AVAILABLE
AT THE MOMENT.

05:48.078 --> 05:50.751
CAN I GIVE HIM A MESSAGE,
MISS...

05:50.751 --> 05:52.883
SORRY. I'M AMBER JAMES.

05:52.883 --> 05:54.885
I JUST NEED TO TALK TO HIM
ABOUT SOMETHING.

05:54.885 --> 05:56.557
IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT.

05:56.557 --> 05:59.059
WELL, I WOULD BE HAPPY
TO TELL HIM WHAT IT'S REGARDING

05:59.059 --> 06:02.433
IF YOU... TELL ME...
 WHAT IT'S REGARDING.

06:02.433 --> 06:05.536
WE'RE JUST... OLD FRIENDS.

06:05.536 --> 06:08.999
I'M AT THE FAIRVIEW MOTOR INN.
COULD YOU ASK HIM TO COME BY?

06:08.999 --> 06:11.542
WHY EXACTLY
WOULD HE BE DOING THAT?

06:11.542 --> 06:14.445
(chuckles)

06:14.445 --> 06:17.948
YOU'RE... KIND OF
A NOSY LANDLADY, AREN'T YOU?

06:17.948 --> 06:21.982
I'M NOT HIS LANDLADY.
I'M HIS GIRLFRIEND.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.984
(inhales deeply)

06:23.984 --> 06:26.056
SO HE...

06:26.056 --> 06:28.489
LIVES HERE WITH YOU?

06:28.489 --> 06:29.920
YES.

06:29.920 --> 06:32.963
YEAH, OF--
OF COURSE HE DOES.

06:32.963 --> 06:34.965
(voice breaks)
OF COURSE HE DOES.

06:34.965 --> 06:37.097
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

06:37.097 --> 06:39.500
UM, YEAH, I'M FINE.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.533
YOU KNOW WHAT? DON'T EVEN, UH,
DON'T EVEN TELL HIM I CAME BY.

06:42.533 --> 06:45.536
THERE'S NO MESSAGE.
SORRY TO DISTURB YOU.

06:45.536 --> 06:47.978
OKAY, YOU'RE ALL SET.

06:47.978 --> 06:50.040
THE DIALYSIS WILL TAKE
SIX HOURS.

06:50.040 --> 06:56.487
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,
JUST HIT THE CALL BUTTON.
 WILL DO.

06:56.487 --> 06:59.750
(telephone ringing in distance)

06:59.750 --> 07:01.492
(exhales deeply)

07:03.694 --> 07:05.425
HI.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.758
HI.

07:07.758 --> 07:11.061
I'M SUSAN.

07:11.061 --> 07:14.104
IT'S MY FIRST TIME IN HERE.

07:14.104 --> 07:16.136
DICK.

07:16.136 --> 07:20.541
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN
COMING HERE FOR A WHILE.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.142
FOUR YEARS.

07:22.142 --> 07:25.115
(machine clanking)

07:25.115 --> 07:28.078
(sighs)
ANY TIPS FOR A NEWBIE?

07:28.078 --> 07:30.080
LIKE, WHICH NURSE
HAS THE SHAKES

07:30.080 --> 07:33.053
OR WHERE DO THEY HIDE
THE GOOD PAINKILLERS?

07:33.053 --> 07:34.755
LOOK, NOTHING PERSONAL,

07:34.755 --> 07:36.957
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE
YOUR DIALYSIS BUDDY.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.459
I WANNA SIT HERE
AND PLAY SCRABBLE ON MY PHONE

07:39.459 --> 07:42.232
WHILE THIS--WHILE THIS MACHINE
WASHES MY BLOOD.

07:43.934 --> 07:46.637
SO YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK
OR BE FRIENDLY

07:46.637 --> 07:48.939
OR KEEP EACH OTHER COMPANY?

07:48.939 --> 07:51.972
SAD, ISN'T IT?

07:54.204 --> 07:57.978
YOU KNOW, DICK...

07:57.978 --> 08:01.081
SOMETIMES WHEN I MEET PEOPLE,
THEY SAY,

08:01.081 --> 08:04.555
"YOU DON'T SEEM LIKE A SUSAN."

08:04.555 --> 08:05.886
BUT YOU...

08:14.124 --> 08:16.797
WHY ARE YOU PUTTING OUT
THOSE UGLY CANDLESTICKS?

08:16.797 --> 08:19.129
OH. WHO GAVE THEM TO ME?

08:19.129 --> 08:21.632
YAY! GRANDMA'S COMING.
 (brakes squeal)

08:21.632 --> 08:23.634
YEP, AND YOUR BROTHER
JUST PULLED UP WITH HER.

08:23.634 --> 08:26.877
THIS COULD BE YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO RUN SCREAMING FROM THE ROOM.

08:26.877 --> 08:28.779
WHY? I LOVE GRANDMA.

08:28.779 --> 08:31.742
I DO, TOO, SWEETIE.
IT'S JUST...

08:31.742 --> 08:33.744
I CAN ONLY TAKE HER
IN SMALL DOSES,

08:33.744 --> 08:36.687
AND UNFORTUNATELY, YOUR GRANDMA
DOESN'T COME IN SMALL DOSES.

08:36.687 --> 08:37.748
(door opens, thud)

08:37.748 --> 08:39.049
(Porter groans)
 HEY!

08:39.049 --> 08:42.192
EASY OVER THE THRESHOLD!
YOU'RE NOT TRANSPORTING MEAT.

08:42.192 --> 08:43.123
(chuckles)

08:43.123 --> 08:46.797
OKAY, GRANDMA,
ENJOY YOUR VISIT.

08:46.797 --> 08:48.799
(under breath)
SHE'S GOING BACK IN A CAB.

08:48.799 --> 08:50.801
MOM! HI!

08:50.801 --> 08:52.302
OH! MWAH!
 MWAH!

08:52.302 --> 08:55.566
(laughs)
 OH, MY GOSH!
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FOOT?

08:55.566 --> 09:00.741
OH, I-I BROKE IT A MONTH AGO.
UH, THANKS FOR CHECKING IN.

09:00.741 --> 09:05.075
OH, I'M SORRY.
WE'VE JUST BEEN SO BUSY, AND...

09:05.075 --> 09:07.077
PENNY, LOOK,
YOUR GRANDMA'S HERE.

09:07.077 --> 09:09.049
GIVE HER A KISS.
 (laughs)

09:09.049 --> 09:13.684
HEY, LOOK AT YOU.
 YOU'RE GETTING BUDS!

09:13.684 --> 09:16.326
AW.

09:16.326 --> 09:19.329
(under breath) BE THANKFUL
SHE DIDN'T YELL IT TO YOU

09:19.329 --> 09:21.331
AS YOU WERE GETTING
ON THE BUS.

09:21.331 --> 09:23.063
SO... UH, WHAT'S NEW?

09:23.063 --> 09:25.565
WELL... ACTUALLY, UM, I STARTED
AN INTERIOR DESIGN BUSINESS.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.567
DO YOU REMEMBER
MY FRIEND RENEE?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.800
I'M GETTING MARRIED.

09:29.800 --> 09:33.203
WHAT? MARRIED?

09:33.203 --> 09:36.046
(gasps) TO WHO?

09:36.046 --> 09:37.307
FRANK KAMINSKI.

09:37.307 --> 09:40.010
WE MET IN WATER AEROBICS
AT THE RETIREMENT COMMUNITY.

09:40.010 --> 09:43.013
ONLY MAN IN THE POOL.
I WAS LUCKY TO GET HIM.

09:43.013 --> 09:45.015
THIS IS KIND OF A SHOCK.

09:45.015 --> 09:47.017
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU WERE DATING.

09:47.017 --> 09:49.119
SO... WHEN'S THE WEDDING?

09:49.119 --> 09:51.061
SATURDAY.

09:51.061 --> 09:53.223
THIS SATURDAY?

09:53.223 --> 09:55.595
UH, AND YOU'RE JUST
TELLING ME NOW?

09:55.595 --> 09:58.068
WELL, MAYBE IF YOU VISITED

09:58.068 --> 09:59.930
MORE OFTEN...
 MORE OFTEN. I KNOW.

09:59.930 --> 10:01.772
I KNOW. SO...

10:01.772 --> 10:04.334
(sighs)
DO I GET TO MEET HIM?

10:04.334 --> 10:07.778
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE GOING TO
MAKE THIS KIND OF COMMITMENT...

10:07.778 --> 10:10.781
WHAT? YOU WANNA MAKE SURE
HIS INTENTIONS ARE HONORABLE?

10:10.781 --> 10:13.083
LYNETTE, I HATE
TO BREAK THIS TO YOU.

10:13.083 --> 10:15.085
I AM NOT A VIRGIN.

10:15.085 --> 10:19.019
MOM... I WANT TO MEET HIM.

10:19.019 --> 10:22.022
ALL RIGHT, COME BY TOMORROW,
AND WE'LL SQUEEZE YOU IN

10:22.022 --> 10:25.195
BETWEEN "NOTHING TO DO"
AND "WAITING FOR DEATH."

10:44.675 --> 10:46.246
(moans)

10:46.246 --> 10:48.949
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
 (groggy voice) WHAT?

10:48.949 --> 10:51.151
YOU WERE YELLING
IN YOUR SLEEP.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.382
REALLY?

10:52.382 --> 10:55.956
YES, YOU WERE SHOUTING OUT,
"AMBER! AMBER!"

10:55.956 --> 10:58.128
WHAT COULD THAT MEAN?

10:58.128 --> 11:01.992
I'M... I'M DOING
A PAINTING JOB.

11:01.992 --> 11:04.264
I'M THINKING ABOUT, UH...

11:04.264 --> 11:07.137
SHADES OF YELLOW
THAT GO IN THE KITCHEN.

11:07.137 --> 11:11.071
NOPE. DEFINITELY NOT A COLOR.
SOUNDED LIKE A NAME--AMBER.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.073
KNOW ANYONE BY THAT NAME?

11:13.073 --> 11:16.847
I ONCE HAD A GIRLFRIEND
NAMED AMBER.

11:16.847 --> 11:18.949
DID YOU?

11:18.949 --> 11:21.251
AND AT THIS TIME
I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT

11:21.251 --> 11:23.213
THAT DREAMING
OF AN OLD GIRLFRIEND

11:23.213 --> 11:25.185
IS NOT CHEATING.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.217
WELL... (sighs)
WHEN WAS THIS?

11:27.217 --> 11:29.990
YOU NEVER TOLD ME
ABOUT HER.

11:29.990 --> 11:32.262
(sighs)

11:32.262 --> 11:35.325
I-I DON'T KNOW.
SEVEN YEARS AGO?

11:35.325 --> 11:37.197
SEVEN YEARS?

11:37.197 --> 11:40.470
WAS IT SERIOUS?

11:40.470 --> 11:44.204
(sighs)
WE LIVED TOGETHER...

11:44.204 --> 11:46.807
FOR, UH, THREE YEARS.

11:46.807 --> 11:49.479
SO YOU WERE IN LOVE
WITH HER.

11:49.479 --> 11:52.042
WELL... YEAH,

11:52.042 --> 11:54.384
UNTIL SHE LEFT ME.

11:58.148 --> 12:00.791
SO SHE LEFT YOU. (chuckles)

12:03.223 --> 12:04.895
YOU MISS HER?

12:04.895 --> 12:08.198
I TEND TO NOT DWELL ON PEOPLE
WHO STOMPED ON MY HEART.

12:08.198 --> 12:11.201
NOW IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'M GONNA GO BACK TO SLEEP

12:11.201 --> 12:13.203
SO I CAN DREAM ABOUT YOU.

12:16.206 --> 12:18.068
(moans)

12:19.840 --> 12:21.171
OHH.

12:21.171 --> 12:23.173
IT'S SO GREAT VISITING
A RETIREMENT VILLAGE--

12:23.173 --> 12:26.346
2 REGULAR PARKING SPACES,
48 HANDICAPPED.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.048
HEY, MOM. MWAH.

12:28.048 --> 12:30.120
(chuckles) LYNETTE...

12:30.120 --> 12:32.222
THIS IS FRANK.

12:32.222 --> 12:34.224
IT IS SO NICE TO MEET YOU,
FRANK.

12:34.224 --> 12:37.227
CALL ME "DAD."

12:37.227 --> 12:40.090
(laughs) WOULDN'T IT BE AWFUL
IF I WAS THAT GUY?

12:40.090 --> 12:42.262
OH. (laughs)

12:42.262 --> 12:43.763
(both laughing)
 AW.

12:43.763 --> 12:48.899
SO... FRANK, UM, I'VE JUST
BEEN DYING TO MEET YOU, AND--

12:48.899 --> 12:50.901
JUST A SEC. HEY, MUCHACHO.

12:50.901 --> 12:53.373
WE'VE BEEN WAITING
TEN MINUTES FOR OUR MENU.

12:53.373 --> 12:57.107
WHAT DO I GOT TO DO TO GET YOU
TO HURRY IT OVER, BUILD A FENCE?

12:59.279 --> 13:02.312
HEY, IT'S A MENU,
NOT A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA.

13:02.312 --> 13:05.385
I'M SURE YOU CAN FIND ONE
SOMEWHERE. (laughs)

13:05.385 --> 13:08.258
OH, YEAH.
YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING?

13:10.060 --> 13:12.062
LYNETTE'S BEEN DYING
TO MEET YOU.

13:12.062 --> 13:14.524
SHE HAS SO MANY QUESTIONS.

13:14.524 --> 13:17.527
OH, GO AHEAD. I GOT TIME TO KILL
WHILE I'M WAITING

13:17.527 --> 13:20.530
FOR PANCHO VILLA TO GET MY MENU.

13:22.172 --> 13:27.237
OKAY. UH...
I WAS JUST WONDERING,

13:27.237 --> 13:31.311
WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE
TO PROPOSE TO MY MOTHER?

13:31.311 --> 13:34.214
I LOVE HER. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:34.214 --> 13:39.189
AW. WHAT A SHORT... ANGRY STORY.

13:39.189 --> 13:42.422
FRANK... IS VERY TO THE POINT.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.155
THAT'S WHAT FIRST
ATTRACTED ME TO HIM.

13:45.155 --> 13:48.498
OH.
 WHAT ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW?

13:48.498 --> 13:52.102
UM, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
MARRIED BEFORE?

13:52.102 --> 13:54.834
THREE TIMES--TWO DEAD
AND TWO LEFT ME.

13:54.834 --> 13:58.338
OH, WAIT A MINUTE. THAT'S FOUR.
YEAH, THEN MAKE IT FOUR.

14:00.370 --> 14:03.573
NOW... YOU DONE GRILLING ME?

14:05.115 --> 14:09.219
YES. I THINK I'VE LEARNED
EVERYTHING I NEED TO KNOW.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.053
(knock on door)

14:13.053 --> 14:14.354
HI, GABY.
 HEY, KAREN.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.057
I WANTED TO GET THE NAME
OF THAT CHINESE PLACE

14:17.057 --> 14:19.389
YOU AND ROY
ARE ALWAYS RAVING ABOUT.

14:19.389 --> 14:22.262
COME ON IN.
I'LL GET YOU THE ADDRESS.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.264
(sighs) CARLOS IS
A LITTLE GRUMPY

14:24.264 --> 14:26.236
SINCE THE CREDIT CARD BILLS
CAME IN.
 HMM.

14:26.236 --> 14:28.969
I FIGURED A LITTLE M.S.G.
SHOULD CALM HIM DOWN.

14:28.969 --> 14:32.172
I'VE GOT A MENU HERE
SOMEWHERE.

14:33.543 --> 14:35.505
I NEVER NOTICED THAT BEFORE.

14:35.505 --> 14:36.546
WHAT?

14:36.546 --> 14:37.908
THAT DOLL.

14:37.908 --> 14:39.209
OH, ADELAIDE.

14:39.209 --> 14:42.112
HECK, I'VE HAD HER
SINCE FOREVER.

14:42.112 --> 14:44.484
SHE WAS MY BEST FRIEND
GROWING UP.

14:44.484 --> 14:47.487
I COULDN'T BEAR TO TOSS HER,
SO THERE SHE IS.

14:47.487 --> 14:50.120
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE
INTO DOLLS.

14:50.120 --> 14:53.593
I'M NOT REALLY INTO THEM.
OH! HERE'S THE MENU.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.930
WHERE DID, UH,
THAT COME FROM?

14:59.930 --> 15:02.272
I CARRY HER AROUND WITH ME.

15:02.272 --> 15:04.304
YOU DO?

15:04.304 --> 15:06.306
MM-HMM.
HER NAME'S PRINCESS VALERIE.

15:06.306 --> 15:09.209
(giggles) OH! LOOK!
THEY COULD BE SISTERS.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.681
OKAY.

15:11.681 --> 15:14.314
(gasps) OH, I HAVE AN IDEA.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.616
MISS CHARLOTTE'S DOLL ACADEMY,
WHERE I GOT VALERIE,

15:16.616 --> 15:18.318
HAS THIS TEAROOM.

15:18.318 --> 15:21.291
IT IS BEAUTIFUL.
ALL OF US SHOULD GO SOMETIME.

15:21.291 --> 15:24.354
BY ALL OF US,
YOU MEAN THE DOLLS?

15:24.354 --> 15:27.457
OF COURSE.
SHOULD I MAKE A RESERVATION?

15:27.457 --> 15:29.929
WELL... MAYBE.

15:29.929 --> 15:33.633
I'M KINDA CURIOUS TO SEE WHERE
THIS ALL GOES. (chuckles)

15:33.633 --> 15:35.405
HERE.
 THANKS.

15:35.405 --> 15:39.469
(indistinct conversations)

15:39.469 --> 15:41.241
OH, NO!

15:41.241 --> 15:42.472
WHAT'S WRONG?

15:42.472 --> 15:45.545
I SAID "NO MAYO,"
LIKE, 15 TIMES.

15:45.545 --> 15:48.648
I'LL TRADE WITH YOU.
DO YOU WANT MY SALAD?

15:48.648 --> 15:51.721
UH, LET ME CHECK.
NOPE, STILL GOT A PENIS.

15:51.721 --> 15:55.055
I WANT MY HAMBURGER
THE WAY I ORDERED IT.

15:55.055 --> 15:58.158
I'LL GET YOU A NEW ONE.
 I GOT TEE TIME IN TEN MINUTES.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.289
SO GO!

15:59.289 --> 16:04.064
IT'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU
AT THE CONDO, WRAPPED IN FOIL,

16:04.064 --> 16:06.396
WITH AN ICE COLD BEER
WHEN YOU GET THERE.

16:06.396 --> 16:08.398
(laughs) YOU'RE--
YOU'RE SO GOOD TO ME.

16:08.398 --> 16:12.272
(laughs) SEE YOU AT THE WEDDING,
LORRAINE.

16:14.304 --> 16:16.976
(lowers voice)
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

16:16.976 --> 16:18.248
WELL, HE'S QUITE A...

16:18.248 --> 16:22.112
I WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO... OKAY, HE'S GONE.

16:22.112 --> 16:25.555
(lowers voice)
HOW CAN YOU MARRY THAT JERK?
 LYNETTE!

16:25.555 --> 16:28.258
I MEAN IT. HE'S ABRASIVE,
OBNOXIOUS, BORDERLINE RACIST--

16:28.258 --> 16:30.260
NO, HE CROSSED
THE BORDER OF RACIST.

16:30.260 --> 16:34.324
HE LIVES IN RACIST.
YOU CANNOT SERIOUSLY LOVE HIM.

16:34.324 --> 16:36.166
I DON'T.

16:36.166 --> 16:37.467
YOU... YOU DON'T?

16:37.467 --> 16:41.131
THEN WHY ARE YOU
MARRYING HIM?

16:41.131 --> 16:42.432
BECAUSE HE'S LOADED,

16:42.432 --> 16:45.305
AND HE HATES HIS KIDS,
AND HE'S GOT A BAD TICKER.

16:45.305 --> 16:49.479
AND WHEN HE KICKS THE BUCKET,
I GET EVERYTHING.

16:49.479 --> 16:53.083
YOU'RE MARRYING HIM
FOR HIS MONEY?

16:53.083 --> 16:55.385
PLEASE. I MARRIED FOR LOVE
THREE TIMES

16:55.385 --> 17:00.150
AND ENDED UP BROKENHEARTED
AND PISS-POOR.

17:00.150 --> 17:01.621
AND BY THE WAY,

17:01.621 --> 17:05.625
HE'S GETTING SOMETHING
OUT OF THIS, TOO.

17:05.625 --> 17:09.398
YOU WANNA KNOW HOW
I REALLY BROKE MY FOOT?

17:22.642 --> 17:24.743
(sighs)

17:29.079 --> 17:30.320
PAUL?

17:33.183 --> 17:36.326
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP?
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

17:38.328 --> 17:40.630
COULDN'T SLEEP.

17:40.630 --> 17:46.136
I'VE JUST BEEN...
SITTING HERE, THINKING.

17:49.799 --> 17:51.201
ABOUT WHAT?

17:54.844 --> 17:58.308
I HAVE SO MUCH HATRED
INSIDE ME...

17:58.308 --> 18:02.252
FROM MY NEIGHBORS
WHO BETRAYED ME...

18:02.252 --> 18:06.186
FOR MY SON
WHO DISOWNED ME.

18:07.857 --> 18:10.390
FOR WHOEVER TRIED
TO KILL ME.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.197
I'M TIRED OF HATING PEOPLE,

18:17.197 --> 18:20.500
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO STOP.

18:20.500 --> 18:24.234
WHAT A THING TO SAY.

18:24.234 --> 18:26.806
STOP BEING SO HARD
ON YOURSELF.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.308
YOU'RE A DECENT MAN.

18:28.308 --> 18:33.283
YOU JUST NEED TO FOCUS
ON WHAT'S GOOD IN YOUR LIFE.

18:33.283 --> 18:37.347
WHAT IS THAT AGAIN?

18:37.347 --> 18:41.491
WELL, FOR STARTERS, ME.

18:41.491 --> 18:47.657
I DO THINK ABOUT YOU...
ALL THE TIME.

18:47.657 --> 18:50.360
FROM THE FIRST MOMENT
I MET YOU,

18:50.360 --> 18:53.663
ALL I WANTED
WAS FOR YOU TO LOVE ME.

18:53.663 --> 18:58.308
AND... HERE WE ARE.

19:00.340 --> 19:03.243
HERE WE ARE.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.245
YOU'RE JUST TIRED.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.317
COME BACK TO BED.

19:08.918 --> 19:11.751
ALL RIGHT.

19:11.751 --> 19:14.254
TOMORROW WE CAN TALK
ABOUT OUR TRIP.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.756
WE NEED TO DECIDE
WHERE WE'RE GOING.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.828
YES, ABOUT THAT...

19:18.828 --> 19:20.830
I BOOKED US A CABIN
IN THE WOODS.

19:20.830 --> 19:24.494
CABIN?
OH, THAT SOUNDS... RUSTIC.

19:24.494 --> 19:28.238
I NEED TO GO SOMEWHERE
FAR AWAY

19:28.238 --> 19:31.341
WHERE NOBODY CAN FIND US.

19:31.341 --> 19:35.205
OKAY.

19:35.205 --> 19:36.206
MM.

19:36.206 --> 19:38.208
(sighs)

19:40.510 --> 19:43.853
YOU CAN BE HAPPY, PAUL.

19:43.853 --> 19:47.857
YOU JUST NEED TO IDENTIFY
WHAT'S NEGATIVE IN YOUR LIFE...

19:47.857 --> 19:50.360
(whispers)
AND THEN GET RID OF IT.

19:53.192 --> 19:57.227
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

19:57.227 --> 19:58.568
(knock on door)

19:58.568 --> 20:01.901
HEY, KAREN.
GABY'S IN THE KITCHEN.

20:01.901 --> 20:04.904
ACTUALLY, I WANNA TALK
TO YOU ABOUT GABY.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.406
HOW'S SHE DOING LATELY?

20:06.406 --> 20:09.409
WELL, YOU KNOW, WE WENT
THROUGH KIND OF A ROUGH PATCH,

20:09.409 --> 20:12.211
BUT I THINK
SHE'S COMING AROUND NOW.

20:12.211 --> 20:16.386
YEAH? WELL, THINK AGAIN.

20:20.290 --> 20:24.324
GIRLS, DINNER'S READY!
I MADE YOUR FAVORITE...

20:28.598 --> 20:30.600
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:30.600 --> 20:31.661
GABY.

20:31.661 --> 20:32.732
AAH!

20:32.732 --> 20:34.864
JEEZ! YOU SCARED ME.

20:34.864 --> 20:38.968
THIS WASN'T A GIFT
FOR BOB AND LEE, WAS IT?

20:41.941 --> 20:44.844
WHY'D YOU LIE TO ME?

20:44.844 --> 20:48.578
BECAUSE I KNEW
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

20:48.578 --> 20:52.452
YOU SPENT $800
ON A DOLL FOR YOURSELF.

20:52.452 --> 20:55.285
Y-YOU'RE RIGHT.
I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

20:55.285 --> 20:56.356
OH, PLEASE.

20:56.356 --> 20:59.489
LIKE THIS IS ANY CRAZIER
THAN YOUR COLLECTIONS.

20:59.489 --> 21:02.261
A STEROID FREAK HITS
A BASEBALL OVER A FENCE,

21:02.261 --> 21:04.464
AND YOU PAID
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR IT.

21:04.464 --> 21:07.397
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T
CARRY IT AROUND WITH ME

21:07.397 --> 21:10.670
OR TAKE IT TO TEA.
 OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
MRS. McCLUSKEY HAS A BIG MOUTH.

21:10.670 --> 21:13.643
SECOND, THE DOLL MAKES ME HAPPY.
WHAT DO YOU CARE?

21:13.643 --> 21:15.645
GABY,
I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY,

21:15.645 --> 21:18.348
BUT THIS IS NOT
ABOUT A DOLL.

21:18.348 --> 21:22.512
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

21:22.512 --> 21:24.914
THIS IS CLEARLY ABOUT GRACE.

21:24.914 --> 21:26.416
NO! NO! NO!

21:26.416 --> 21:28.918
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK
ABOUT HER!

21:28.918 --> 21:31.461
THAT WAS YOUR RULE!

21:31.461 --> 21:33.463
(sighs)

21:33.463 --> 21:37.597
I'M GOING TO GET READY
FOR DINNER.

21:41.831 --> 21:43.072
HEY, SUSAN.

21:43.072 --> 21:45.074
I KEPT HER WARM FOR YA.

21:45.074 --> 21:47.807
THANKS, ETHAN.
HEY, HOW WAS YOUR HISTORY FINAL?

21:47.807 --> 21:50.309
ACED IT. THANK YOU
FOR STUDYING WITH ME.

21:50.309 --> 21:53.443
NO PROBLEM.
I'LL SEE YOU THURSDAY.
 YEAH.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.991
AHEM.

22:03.553 --> 22:04.994
SCRABBLE. (chuckles)

22:04.994 --> 22:06.996
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU DON'T WANNA TALK,

22:06.996 --> 22:09.999
BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
MORE FUN TO PLAY WITH ME

22:09.999 --> 22:12.001
THAN WITH YOUR PHONE.

22:12.001 --> 22:15.835
THANKS,
BUT I'LL TAKE THE PHONE.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.837
YOU KNOW,
THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE

22:17.837 --> 22:20.710
IS MISERABLE
AND ISOLATING ENOUGH.

22:20.710 --> 22:23.673
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU WANNA MAKE IT WORSE

22:23.673 --> 22:26.376
BY IGNORING SOMEONE WHO'S
GOING THROUGH THE SAME ORDEAL.

22:26.376 --> 22:28.878
SUSAN, DID YOU EVER SEE
THE OLD WAR MOVIE

22:28.878 --> 22:31.381
WHERE THE FRESH YOUNG KID
COMES IN ALL BRIGHT-EYED,

22:31.381 --> 22:34.524
AND THE OLD VET WON'T
GIVE HIM THE TIME OF DAY?

22:34.524 --> 22:36.025
I HATE WAR MOVIES.

22:36.025 --> 22:38.728
OKAY.

22:38.728 --> 22:40.430
WHAT ABOUT THE ONE

22:40.430 --> 22:42.392
WHERE THE GIRL MOVES
TO A DIFFERENT TOWN,

22:42.392 --> 22:44.394
AND THE MEAN CHEERLEADER
AT HER NEW SCHOOL

22:44.394 --> 22:46.436
DOESN'T WANNA HANG OUT
WITH HER?

22:46.436 --> 22:47.737
GO ON.

22:47.737 --> 22:51.501
I'M THE MEAN CHEERLEADER.
OKAY?

22:51.501 --> 22:55.505
AND I'M LETTING YOU KNOW
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE FRIENDS.

22:55.505 --> 22:58.508
(machine clanking)

23:04.454 --> 23:08.618
YOU KNOW, I CAN SEE WHY
YOU'RE FRUSTRATED.

23:08.618 --> 23:11.661
WAITING FOR A TRANSPLANT
IS BRUTAL.

23:11.661 --> 23:14.023
I-I GET THAT.

23:14.023 --> 23:18.127
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
YOU CAN'T TRY TO STAY POSITIVE

23:18.127 --> 23:20.870
WHILE YOU WAIT
FOR THE GOOD NEWS.

23:20.870 --> 23:24.434
THE GOOD NEWS?

23:24.434 --> 23:28.407
WHEN THIS BEEPER GOES OFF,
THAT MEANS SOMEONE DIED.

23:28.407 --> 23:31.410
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WAITING FOR--
FOR SOME POOR SON OF A BITCH

23:31.410 --> 23:35.445
WHO DIDN'T USE A HELMET
OR A SEAT BELT TO DIE.

23:35.445 --> 23:37.487
WE'RE WAITING FOR A DOCTOR
TO ASK A FAMILY

23:37.487 --> 23:40.019
WHO, MOMENTS EARLIER,
LOST SOMEONE THEY LOVED

23:40.019 --> 23:42.792
TO LET THEM
HARVEST THEIR ORGANS.

23:42.792 --> 23:45.695
AND THEN WE'RE WAITING
TO SEE WHO GETS THEM.

23:45.695 --> 23:48.698
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
WE WAIT FOR TRAGEDY

23:48.698 --> 23:50.700
AND THEN CROSS OUR FINGERS
THAT IT'S US

23:50.700 --> 23:52.662
THEY WAKE UP
AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING

23:52.662 --> 23:55.705
WITH THE GOOD NEWS.

23:55.705 --> 23:59.138
SUSAN...

23:59.138 --> 24:01.210
I KNOW YOUR INTENTIONS
ARE GOOD,

24:01.210 --> 24:03.142
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DISTRACT ME

24:03.142 --> 24:05.945
OR ENTERTAIN ME
OR COMFORT ME.

24:07.947 --> 24:12.482
I WASN'T TRYING
TO COMFORT... YOU.

24:18.828 --> 24:20.159
(knocks)

24:20.159 --> 24:22.892
(siren wailing, horns honking)

24:22.892 --> 24:26.095
HI, AMBER.
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

24:26.095 --> 24:28.598
WELL, YOU SEEMED SO UPSET
WHEN YOU CAME OVER,

24:28.598 --> 24:30.600
AND OBVIOUSLY
IT INVOLVES KEITH,

24:30.600 --> 24:32.602
OR YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
COME LOOKING FOR HIM,

24:32.602 --> 24:34.604
AND SO NATURALLY
I'M CONCERNED.

24:34.604 --> 24:36.606
EVERYTHING'S FINE.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

24:36.606 --> 24:38.107
ANYWAY, I'M...

24:38.107 --> 24:41.911
SORT OF IN THE MIDDLE
OF PACKING, SO...

24:41.911 --> 24:44.584
MOMMY,
I CAN'T FIND MY BALL.

24:44.584 --> 24:47.757
CHARLIE, I'LL BE WITH YOU
IN A SECOND, OKAY?

24:52.121 --> 24:53.693
HOW OLD IS CHARLIE?

24:55.024 --> 24:57.496
6.

25:08.137 --> 25:10.640
KEITH AND I WOULD BE
GREAT FOR A WHILE

25:10.640 --> 25:12.612
AND THEN NOT SO GREAT.

25:12.612 --> 25:16.515
I HAD ACTUALLY MOVED OUT BEFORE
I REALIZED I WAS PREGNANT.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.748
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL KEITH?

25:18.748 --> 25:21.991
(sighs)

25:21.991 --> 25:24.794
I HAD ACTUALLY DECIDED
TO GIVE UP THE BABY,

25:24.794 --> 25:28.558
AND I KNEW HE WOULD TRY
AND TALK ME OUT OF IT.

25:28.558 --> 25:31.961
THEN I CHANGED MY MIND
THE MOMENT I SAW CHARLIE.

25:31.961 --> 25:35.204
AFTER THAT, IT JUST NEVER
FELT RIGHT TO COME BACK

25:35.204 --> 25:37.807
AND AMBUSH HIM WITH A KID.

25:37.807 --> 25:42.211
AND YET...
HERE YOU ARE, AMBUSHING.

25:42.211 --> 25:44.213
IT'S JUST...
CHARLIE IS AT THAT AGE

25:44.213 --> 25:46.716
WHERE HE'S STARTING
TO ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS,

25:46.716 --> 25:49.148
AND I'M RUNNING OUT
OF WAYS TO BE VAGUE.

25:49.148 --> 25:52.181
SO CHARLIE IS
THE ONLY REASON YOU CAME?

25:52.181 --> 25:54.884
OKAY.

25:54.884 --> 25:56.886
MAYBE I...
WAS KIND OF WONDERING

25:56.886 --> 26:01.090
IF KEITH WOULD STILL BE...

26:01.090 --> 26:03.893
BUT I'M GLAD HE'S HAPPY.

26:03.893 --> 26:05.264
YOU SEEM REALLY GREAT.

26:07.196 --> 26:10.199
I KNOW I OWE IT
TO CHARLIE TO TELL KEITH.

26:10.199 --> 26:14.674
IT'S JUST...
I DON'T THINK I CAN DO IT.

26:18.147 --> 26:20.309
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO?

26:20.309 --> 26:23.252
YOU WOULD DO THAT?

26:25.354 --> 26:28.718
I THINK I HAVE TO.

26:28.718 --> 26:30.720
NOW, IT'S NOT EXACTLY
FINISHED YET.

26:30.720 --> 26:33.723
I'M STILL WAITING
ON A FEW PIECES,

26:33.723 --> 26:35.594
AND THE CURTAINS
ARE ON BACK ORDER.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.596
DON'T WORRY.
I'M SURE IT'S AMAZING.

26:37.596 --> 26:40.299
BUT YOU DID KEEP
THE RECEIPTS, RIGHT?

26:55.044 --> 26:57.246
OH, MY GOD.

26:57.246 --> 27:00.950
IT'S EXACTLY THE ROOM I WANTED
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP.

27:00.950 --> 27:03.192
I MEAN, THE ONLY THING
THAT'S MISSING IS...

27:03.192 --> 27:05.224
(gasps) BABY UNICORNS!

27:05.224 --> 27:07.396
(laughs)

27:07.396 --> 27:10.129
SO... YOU LIKE IT?

27:10.129 --> 27:12.131
OH, WE LOVE IT.
THANK YOU, RENEE.

27:12.131 --> 27:15.805
IT'S EVERYTHING WE'D HOPED FOR.
 HOW DID YOU PUT THIS
TOGETHER SO QUICKLY?

27:15.805 --> 27:17.306
OH, IT WAS EASY.

27:17.306 --> 27:20.970
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THIS ROOM FOR 20 YEARS.

27:20.970 --> 27:22.842
REALLY?

27:22.842 --> 27:26.275
(sighs) THERE WAS A TIME WHEN
I THOUGHT I MIGHT HAVE KIDS.

27:26.275 --> 27:28.247
I USED TO IMAGINE
THE KIND OF ROOM

27:28.247 --> 27:32.351
I'D WANT MY DAUGHTER
TO HAVE. MM.

27:32.351 --> 27:36.686
RIGHT DOWN
TO THE LAST DETAIL.

27:36.686 --> 27:39.188
I NEVER KNEW
YOU THOUGHT ABOUT KIDS.

27:39.188 --> 27:42.732
WELL, THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

27:42.732 --> 27:47.296
IT'S NEVER TOO LATE.
HECK, IF WE CAN ADOPT...

27:47.296 --> 27:51.440
(sighs) EXCUSE ME.
I'VE GOTTA FIND THAT PAINTER.

27:51.440 --> 27:56.675
THIS IS NOT THE COLOR
WE AGREED ON FOR THE TRIM.

28:02.281 --> 28:06.385
I CAN'T DO IT.
I CAN'T BE A PARTY TO THIS.

28:06.385 --> 28:09.388
I CAN'T WHEEL HER DOWN THE AISLE
TO MARRY SOME JACKASS

28:09.388 --> 28:10.890
SHE DOESN'T EVEN LOVE.

28:10.890 --> 28:13.723
LYNETTE,
YOU HAVE TO DO THIS.

28:13.723 --> 28:17.226
BESIDES, YOU KNOW,
THINK OF WHAT'S AT STAKE NOW.

28:17.226 --> 28:19.228
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
 (fusses)

28:19.228 --> 28:21.700
WELL, YOU KNOW,
HOW CAN I PUT THIS DELICATELY?

28:21.700 --> 28:24.373
I MEAN, TODAY YOUR MOTHER
HAS MONEY.

28:24.373 --> 28:27.376
SOMEDAY SOON SHE WILL DIE.

28:27.376 --> 28:31.080
THE DAY AFTER THAT,
TOM AND LYNETTE HAVE MONEY.

28:31.080 --> 28:32.942
THAT'S A HORRIBLE THING
TO SAY.

28:32.942 --> 28:35.244
WELL, JUST SAYING, YOU'VE
ALWAYS WANTED TO PUT PAIGE

28:35.244 --> 28:37.947
IN PRIVATE SCHOOL,
AND I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW

28:37.947 --> 28:40.419
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SLEEP
ON A YACHT.

28:40.419 --> 28:44.293
(hisses) YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU'RE HOLDING THE BABY.

28:44.293 --> 28:48.127
LYNETTE, IN ALL SERIOUSNESS,
IT'S YOUR MOTHER'S WEDDING DAY.

28:48.127 --> 28:50.129
IF YOU DON'T SUPPORT HER,

28:50.129 --> 28:52.361
YOU'RE GONNA RUIN
YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

28:52.361 --> 28:55.164
(organ playing)

28:55.164 --> 28:57.236
(Stella) LYNETTE!

28:57.236 --> 28:58.367
YEAH?

28:58.367 --> 29:00.109
THEY'RE PLAYING MY SONG.

29:00.109 --> 29:02.371
ARE YOU READY
TO WHEEL ME DOWN?

29:02.371 --> 29:06.375
(Wagner's "Bridal Chorus
from 'Lohengrin'" playing)

29:24.133 --> 29:25.464
(mouths words)

29:33.843 --> 29:36.305
LYNETTE! LYNETTE!

29:36.305 --> 29:38.808
(Stella) LYNETTE! LYNETTE.

29:38.808 --> 29:40.779
LYNETTE!

29:40.779 --> 29:42.281
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:42.281 --> 29:44.984
OKAY, HERE'S THE THING.
I CAN'T LET YOU DO THIS.

29:44.984 --> 29:46.285
WHO ASKED YOU?

29:46.285 --> 29:48.988
YOU CAN'T MARRY
AN OBNOXIOUS JERK LIKE THAT.

29:48.988 --> 29:51.390
MOM, YOU WANT ME TO VISIT
MORE OFTEN?

29:51.390 --> 29:53.923
THAT IS NEVER GONNA HAPPEN
IF YOU'RE WITH HIM.

29:53.923 --> 29:55.925
AND THINK ABOUT THE EXAMPLE

29:55.925 --> 29:57.827
YOU ARE SETTING
YOUR GRANDCHILDREN--

29:57.827 --> 29:59.829
MARRYING A GUY FOR HIS MONEY.

29:59.829 --> 30:02.331
NOW, LOOK, TOM AND I
HAVE A LITTLE SAVINGS--

30:02.331 --> 30:06.836
LYNETTE, I KNOW FRANK'S A BIT
OF AN ACQUIRED TASTE.

30:06.836 --> 30:08.307
BUT...

30:08.307 --> 30:11.410
HE NEEDS ME.

30:11.410 --> 30:14.483
NOBODY NEEDS ME ANYMORE.

30:14.483 --> 30:17.546
YOUR SISTERS ARE ALWAYS BUSY.

30:17.546 --> 30:19.889
I NEVER SEE YOU.

30:19.889 --> 30:22.892
I TRY TO SEE YOU
AS MUCH AS I CAN, BUT--

30:22.892 --> 30:24.994
I KNOW.

30:24.994 --> 30:27.897
YOUR FAMILY NEEDS YOU.

30:27.897 --> 30:30.930
AND FRANK... NEEDS ME.

30:35.234 --> 30:37.236
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THIS?

30:37.236 --> 30:40.239
WHY DID YOU LET ME THINK
IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE MONEY?

30:40.239 --> 30:42.541
I GUESS IT WAS EASIER
TO SAY THAT

30:42.541 --> 30:46.515
THAN TO ADMIT HOW...
USELESS AND...

30:49.018 --> 30:51.450
LONELY I FEEL.

30:55.424 --> 30:57.156
OKAY.

30:59.588 --> 31:03.562
HELLO? WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE
A WEDDING OUT HERE.

31:03.562 --> 31:07.536
OH, SORRY! MY DAUGHTER DOESN'T
THINK YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

31:07.536 --> 31:10.099
SHE'S RIGHT.
NOW HURRY IT UP.

31:10.099 --> 31:12.401
THIS CHURCH IS IN ONE
OF THOSE ETHNIC NEIGHBORHOODS,

31:12.401 --> 31:15.244
AND I'M WORRIED
ABOUT THE CAR.

31:27.556 --> 31:29.258
(doorbell rings)

31:31.390 --> 31:34.493
RENEE, THERE IS SOMEONE
WE'D LIKE YOU TO MEET.

31:34.493 --> 31:36.225
THIS IS OUR DAUGHTER.

31:36.225 --> 31:39.068
HELLO.
 WE JUST PICKED HER UP
FROM THE AIRPORT,

31:39.068 --> 31:41.100
AND WE WANTED YOU TO BE

31:41.100 --> 31:44.033
THE FIRST PERSON ON THE LANE
TO MEET HER.
 OH, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
DO THAT.

31:44.033 --> 31:45.274
WE KNOW.

31:45.274 --> 31:48.437
I THINK I'M GONNA START
GETTING HER SETTLED IN.

31:48.437 --> 31:50.439
SAY GOOD-BYE TO MRS. PERRY.
 BYE.

31:50.439 --> 31:51.580
(chuckles) COME ON.

31:51.580 --> 31:54.113
SHE'S ABSOLUTELY PRECIOUS.

31:54.113 --> 31:57.616
YEAH. WE'RE VERY LUCKY.

31:57.616 --> 32:00.519
LISTEN, CAN I ASK YOU
FOR A FAVOR?

32:00.519 --> 32:03.322
LEE, YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE
SENTENCES THAT START THAT WAY.

32:03.322 --> 32:06.325
BOB AND I HAVE BEEN THINKING,
AND EVEN THOUGH I KNOW

32:06.325 --> 32:09.328
WE ARE GONNA BE GREAT FATHERS,
THERE MAY BE TIMES

32:09.328 --> 32:13.202
THAT JENNY NEEDS TO TALK
TO A WOMAN ABOUT... STUFF.

32:13.202 --> 32:15.404
AND ON THOSE RARE OCCASIONS,
I WAS WONDERING IF WE

32:15.404 --> 32:18.407
COULD BRING HER OVER HERE.

32:18.407 --> 32:21.640
WELL...

32:21.640 --> 32:24.043
SURE.

32:24.043 --> 32:26.045
GREAT. I WILL GO TELL
OUR DAUGHTER

32:26.045 --> 32:27.646
THAT IF SHE NEEDS ANYTHING,

32:27.646 --> 32:29.648
SHE CAN COUNT ON
HER OLD AUNTIE RENEE.

32:29.648 --> 32:33.522
AND IF SHE EVER CALLS ME
"OLD AUNTIE," I WILL KICK HER.

32:33.522 --> 32:36.525
GOT IT. SORRY.

32:40.589 --> 32:42.291
THOSE ARE BEAUTIFUL, SUSAN.

32:42.291 --> 32:43.592
THANK YOU, ETHAN.

32:43.592 --> 32:45.594
DON'T WORRY.
THEY'RE NOT FOR YOU.

32:45.594 --> 32:48.537
THEY'RE FOR PEOPLE WHO STILL
POSSESS AN OUNCE OF HUMANITY.

32:48.537 --> 32:51.540
WHATEVER YOU SAY, POLLYANNA.
BUT IF I SEE ANY MYLAR BALLOONS

32:51.540 --> 32:55.274
WITH--WITH DOGS
WEARING STETHOSCOPES,

32:55.274 --> 32:57.006
I'M FILING A COMPLAINT.

32:57.006 --> 33:01.710
(sighs) WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS
 SO MISERABLE?

33:01.710 --> 33:04.153
IT'S CALLED ANGER, SUSAN.

33:04.153 --> 33:06.155
I'M SURE YOU HAVE IT, TOO,

33:06.155 --> 33:09.158
RIGHT UNDERNEATH THAT
"HANG IN THERE, KITTY" SMILE.

33:09.158 --> 33:11.760
HEY, DICK, TAKE IT EASY.
 IT'S OKAY, ETHAN.

33:11.760 --> 33:15.994
FINE. YOU'RE ANGRY.
THE REST OF US AREN'T.

33:15.994 --> 33:20.069
SO STOP DRAGGING US
INTO YOUR CIRCLE OF SELF-PITY.

33:20.069 --> 33:21.370
(scoffs)

33:21.370 --> 33:26.475
(beeping)

33:26.475 --> 33:28.006
UGH. COME ON.

33:28.006 --> 33:31.240
(beeping continues)

33:31.240 --> 33:32.611
(beeping stops)

33:32.611 --> 33:35.044
IT'S ME.

33:37.186 --> 33:40.489
(laughs)

33:40.489 --> 33:43.452
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

33:43.452 --> 33:45.424
THANK YOU.

33:45.424 --> 33:48.297
I GOTTA GO CALL MY MOM.

33:48.297 --> 33:49.758
(Susan) YEAH. (laughs)

33:53.462 --> 33:55.164
(sighs)

34:00.609 --> 34:03.412
(nurse) READY, SUSAN?

34:07.776 --> 34:09.478
YES.

34:11.780 --> 34:16.485
ACTUALLY, UM, I-IF IT'S OKAY,
I'M GONNA...

34:16.485 --> 34:18.427
SIT OVER HERE TODAY.

34:18.427 --> 34:21.389
SURE.

34:41.810 --> 34:44.553
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

34:44.553 --> 34:46.554
LEAVING A NOTE
FOR THE GARDENER.

34:46.554 --> 34:49.257
IF HE HAS ANY MORE PROBLEMS
WITH THOSE SPRINKLERS,

34:49.257 --> 34:52.420
I WANT HIM TO KNOW THAT
WE'LL BE AT THE CABIN.

34:52.420 --> 34:54.592
OH. GOOD IDEA.

35:06.435 --> 35:08.737
BETH, I THINK WE SHOULD BRING
SOME EXTRA BLANKETS.

35:08.737 --> 35:11.810
IT MIGHT GET COLD. WOULD YOU
MIND GRABBING A COUPLE?

35:11.810 --> 35:13.412
NOT AT ALL.

35:19.648 --> 35:22.851
DETECTIVES. EVERYTHING OKAY?

35:22.851 --> 35:25.854
I'M SURE YOUR WIFE TOLD YOU
A GUN WAS RECENTLY DISCOVERED

35:25.854 --> 35:28.297
AT BREE VAN DE KAMP'S HOUSE.

35:28.297 --> 35:30.299
YES, APPARENTLY IT WAS
THE SAME CALIBER

35:30.299 --> 35:32.401
THAT I WAS SHOT WITH.

35:32.401 --> 35:34.903
BREE SEEMS TO THINK
YOUR WIFE PLANTED IT THERE,

35:34.903 --> 35:37.906
HOPING TO IMPLICATE SOME OF
HER FRIENDS IN YOUR SHOOTING.

35:37.906 --> 35:40.409
WHAT AN IMAGINATION SHE HAS.

35:41.910 --> 35:44.243
SO YOU'VE NEVER
SEEN THIS BEFORE?

35:51.220 --> 35:52.421
MR. YOUNG?

35:54.353 --> 35:55.524
YES.

35:55.524 --> 35:58.787
YOU SEEMED TO HAVE
QUITE A REACTION THERE.

35:58.787 --> 36:02.431
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
AROUND FIREARMS, THAT'S ALL.

36:02.431 --> 36:04.433
WELL, JUST TO BE CLEAR,

36:04.433 --> 36:07.196
YOU DO NOT BELIEVE
THIS BELONGS TO YOUR WIFE.

36:07.196 --> 36:10.239
DETECTIVES, I KNOW FOR A FACT
THIS IS NOT BETH'S GUN.

36:10.239 --> 36:12.401
GOOD DAY.

36:21.550 --> 36:24.513
SHOULD WE TAKE
TWO BLANKETS OR THREE?

36:24.513 --> 36:27.185
FORGET THE BLANKETS.
THE TRIP'S OFF.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.757
WHAT? WHY?

36:28.757 --> 36:31.890
I GOT A CALL. THERE'S A PROBLEM
WITH THE CABIN.

36:31.890 --> 36:33.422
OH, SHOOT.

36:33.422 --> 36:36.595
AND I WAS
SO LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

36:36.595 --> 36:38.297
TRUST ME, BETH.

36:38.297 --> 36:41.300
I THINK YOU DODGED
A BULLET HERE.

36:54.683 --> 36:57.646
MMM. I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU DO TO THIS CHICKEN,

36:57.646 --> 37:01.690
BUT IT'S THE BEST THING
THAT I'VE EVER HAD. MMM.

37:01.690 --> 37:05.624
SO I, UM, STOPPED
BY BOB AND LEE'S HOUSE.

37:05.624 --> 37:09.598
THEY'RE SO EXCITED ABOUT
FINALLY BECOMING FATHERS.

37:12.331 --> 37:14.303
WHICH GOT ME TO THINKING,

37:14.303 --> 37:16.305
I KNOW YOU HAD SAID

37:16.305 --> 37:19.308
THAT YOU WERE OKAY WITH NOT
BEING ABLE TO HAVE A CHILD.

37:19.308 --> 37:22.311
IS THAT... STILL THE CASE?

37:22.311 --> 37:24.573
UH, YEAH.

37:26.875 --> 37:28.977
THAT DIDN'T SOUND
VERY CONVINCING.

37:28.977 --> 37:31.450
IT'S KIND OF
A WEIRD QUESTION.

37:31.450 --> 37:33.452
OKAY, WELL,
LET ME REPHRASE IT.

37:33.452 --> 37:36.455
IF YOU HAD THE CHANCE TO BE
A FATHER, WOULD YOU TAKE IT?

37:36.455 --> 37:38.256
(silverware clatters)

37:39.728 --> 37:42.891
BREE, WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?
I THOUGHT WE DEALT WITH THIS.

37:42.891 --> 37:45.894
WELL, I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE

37:45.894 --> 37:49.438
BOB AND LEE WITH THEIR CHILD
AND START TO HAVE REGRETS.

37:49.438 --> 37:51.440
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

37:51.440 --> 37:54.473
ALL RIGHT, THERE WAS A TIME
IN MY LIFE WHEN I THOUGHT,

37:54.473 --> 37:57.846
YEAH. YEAH. I'D LOVE TO BE
A DAD, BUT THEN I MET YOU.

37:59.748 --> 38:03.552
I'M JUST SAYING...
IF YOU HAD THE CHOICE--

38:03.552 --> 38:05.514
I DON'T.

38:09.558 --> 38:11.690
(sighs)

38:11.690 --> 38:14.563
THIS IS REALLY GOOD CHICKEN.

38:24.072 --> 38:25.534
SO?

38:29.738 --> 38:31.440
I'M SORRY.

38:31.440 --> 38:34.713
(sighs)

38:34.713 --> 38:36.845
HE DOESN'T EVEN WANNA
MEET CHARLIE?

38:36.845 --> 38:41.049
WELL, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
THAT AFTER SIX YEARS,

38:41.049 --> 38:44.593
KEITH FEELS THAT IT WOULD BE
TOO DIFFICULT FOR EVERYONE.

38:44.593 --> 38:47.696
WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG?

38:47.696 --> 38:51.560
AGAIN, I AM SO SORRY.

38:53.031 --> 38:55.664
OH, NO.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

38:55.664 --> 38:58.737
PLEASE. KEITH AND I FEEL THAT
WE REALLY NEED TO DO SOMETHING.

38:58.737 --> 39:02.110
SO PLEASE... TAKE IT.

39:19.728 --> 39:24.663
SORRY. I HAD TO SHOW THE SITTER
HOW TO WORK THE TV.

39:24.663 --> 39:26.565
(seat belt clicks)

39:26.565 --> 39:29.598
NOW WHERE IS THIS CHINESE PL--
AAH!

39:30.899 --> 39:34.603
(exhales deeply)
YOU PUT HER IN A CAR SEAT?

39:34.603 --> 39:38.977
OH. WELL, SHE'S EXPENSIVE,
AND THE WAY YOU DRIVE...

39:38.977 --> 39:42.511
HONEY, I'VE BEEN THINKING.

39:42.511 --> 39:45.654
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO SEE
A THERAPIST TOGETHER.

39:45.654 --> 39:47.586
I DON'T NEED A THERAPIST.

39:47.586 --> 39:51.820
I THINK YOU DO. MAYBE I HAVEN'T
BEEN FAIR TO YOU.

39:51.820 --> 39:54.793
BUT YOU DO REALLY NEED TO TALK
TO SOMEONE ABOUT THIS.

39:54.793 --> 39:57.165
CARLOS, I'M NOT CRAZY.

39:57.165 --> 40:00.699
WELL, THEN SHOULD I CHANGE
THE RESERVATION TO THREE?

40:00.699 --> 40:03.802
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
SHE'S NOT GONNA SIT WITH US.

40:03.802 --> 40:06.935
SHE FITS RIGHT IN MY BAG.

40:13.582 --> 40:16.615
THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A PLACE
YOU'D PUT A RESTAURANT.

40:16.615 --> 40:19.648
NO, IT LOOKS LIKE A PLACE
YOU'D BURY A BODY.

40:19.648 --> 40:21.620
WILL YOU PLEASE JUST PUT
THE ADDRESS

40:21.620 --> 40:24.152
INTO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM?
 FOR THE TENTH TIME,
I DON'T NEED IT.

40:24.152 --> 40:26.655
I KNOW WHERE OAK PARK IS.
 CARLOS, I'M STARVING!

40:26.655 --> 40:30.198
I WILL NOT THINK YOU'RE WEAK
IF YOU USE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM!

40:30.198 --> 40:31.900
FINE. I'LL USE IT.

40:31.900 --> 40:36.835
I'D MUCH RATHER LISTEN TO THAT
 ANNOYING VOICE THAN THAT ONE.

40:36.835 --> 40:40.208
(sighs)

40:40.208 --> 40:42.541
WHAT'S THE ADDRESS?

40:42.541 --> 40:45.974
OKAY. IT'S 1-1-9--
 GET OUT OF THE CAR!

40:45.974 --> 40:48.076
OH, GOD!
 OKAY, OKAY, TAKE IT EASY, MAN.

40:48.076 --> 40:51.119
NOW!
 GET OUT. WE'RE DOING IT.
BE COOL.

40:51.119 --> 40:54.653
UH, CAN YOU HOLD ON?

40:54.653 --> 40:58.156
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HOLD ON?!
GET THE HELL OUT OF THE CAR!
 GABY!

40:58.156 --> 41:00.729
I GOTTA GET MY BABY!

41:00.729 --> 41:02.190
OH, CRAP. JUST...

41:04.032 --> 41:07.035
IT'S A DOLL! WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO PULL, BITCH?!
 OH, GOD.

41:07.035 --> 41:10.038
GET OUT BEFORE I PUT
A BULLET IN YOU!
 NO!

41:10.038 --> 41:11.139
GABY!
 GET OUT!

41:11.139 --> 41:13.942
I CAN'T GET THE BUCKLE!
 GABY, COME ON!

41:13.942 --> 41:16.605
I CAN'T GET THE BUCKLE!
I CAN'T GET THE BUCKLE!
 (Carlos) GET--UHH!

41:16.605 --> 41:20.579
NO! OHH! MY BABY!
MY BABY! MY BABY!

41:20.579 --> 41:22.080
MY BABY!
 GABY!

41:22.080 --> 41:23.652
(cries)

41:23.652 --> 41:25.183
IT'S NOT GRACE!

41:25.183 --> 41:29.518
(sobbing)

41:46.575 --> 41:49.077
WHOA. WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TO YOUR ROSES?

41:49.077 --> 41:52.510
PRUNING THEM.

41:52.510 --> 41:55.614
LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE KILLING THEM.

41:55.614 --> 41:57.616
I KNOW IT LOOKS BAD,

41:57.616 --> 41:59.618
BUT SOMETIMES
YOU HAVE TO BE RUTHLESS

41:59.618 --> 42:03.021
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING
BEAUTIFUL TO KEEP GROWING.
 (shears click)

42:05.754 --> 42:12.230
THE WORLD IS FILLED WITH PEOPLE
WHO DO UGLY THINGS.

42:12.230 --> 42:15.764
WHY DO THEY ACT THIS WAY?

42:17.706 --> 42:21.670
SOME LIE TO KEEP FROM LOSING
WHAT THEY LOVE.

42:23.842 --> 42:27.676
SOME LASH OUT BECAUSE
THEY FEAR THE FUTURE.

42:29.848 --> 42:35.724
SOME PUT UP WALLS
BECAUSE THEY HAVE REGRETS.

42:35.724 --> 42:41.159
YES, EVERYONE HAS A REASON
FOR THE UGLY THINGS THEY DO...

42:41.159 --> 42:45.163
AND ONCE WE FIND OUT WHY...

42:45.163 --> 42:48.637
THEN WE CAN TRY TO STOP THEM.
