01:01.301 --> 01:06.263
Hey, you're supposed to be asleep. What's
the matter? / The wicked is gonna get me.

01:06.764 --> 01:12.520
The wicked? / She's out there.
She eats children to stay young.

01:13.354 --> 01:18.067
I think the older kid has been
teasing you, sweety. / I broke her window.

01:19.027 --> 01:21.612
Her window?

01:22.113 --> 01:26.033
If you threw a rock at the house, and break
one of her window, the wicked will get you.

01:26.534 --> 01:32.540
So, you and Jenny went out with the older kids?
You were supposed to stay at her house.

01:33.041 --> 01:37.378
It was just for a bit. Her sister had
a car and we drove.

01:37.879 --> 01:42.341
And I didn't know it that far.
I'm sorry, Mommy.

01:42.842 --> 01:48.056
Well, I remembered a story of the wicked
from when I was a little girl.

01:49.474 --> 01:54.812
And I can tell you, we searched and searched
that old house in the woods...

01:58.858 --> 02:01.945
And it was never a witch to be found.

02:02.779 --> 02:05.657
It was just a silly story
to frighten little kids.

02:06.699 --> 02:08.993
Here.

02:12.205 --> 02:15.749
Now, I have to go concentrate on work.
I have a big case tomorrow.

02:16.250 --> 02:20.046
So you, go to sleep.

03:16.811 --> 03:20.398
Mommy, help me!
Mommy!

03:28.239 --> 03:32.076
Mommy! /
Amanda, that's enough.

03:44.839 --> 03:47.132
Amanda?

03:47.633 --> 03:49.635
Amanda?

03:50.136 --> 03:52.305

07:47.706 --> 07:51.084
I wanna thank you all for coming.
I know my dad would really appreciate.

07:51.585 --> 07:55.965
Quite a character, rather than miss him.
Especially his grandson.

07:58.175 --> 08:04.181
You believe or not, I think you all are gonna miss
his magic. I've always been a victim from time to time.

08:07.101 --> 08:11.397
Before he died, he said something that I think
he wanted me to pass on.

08:12.648 --> 08:15.859
"God is the greatest magician of all."

08:16.360 --> 08:23.450
"Family, friend, and the love that bind
some of us most in need. That lasts forever."

08:27.079 --> 08:29.707
"That's not an illusion."

08:37.798 --> 08:44.346
Told you what, man. When I go, I wanna be cremated.
Of course, no way I'm gonna stuck in the box.

08:44.847 --> 08:46.847
What's the diffrence if you dead?

08:47.847 --> 08:51.228
I'm just saying, I don't wanna bugs and shit
crawling over me chewing on my flesh.

08:51.729 --> 08:53.939
Hey, guys.

09:00.362 --> 09:03.782
That's cute. Hey, hello? Guys!
Excuse me.

09:05.534 --> 09:08.828
Hey, Zack. What's going on? /
Well, my grandpa just died.

09:08.829 --> 09:13.917
He was old, wasn't he? / Nice. /
Yeah. Sucks to get old I guess.

09:14.418 --> 09:18.921
But we're still going tomorrow night, right? /
My dad has to work at hospital all night.

09:18.922 --> 09:22.300
And? / I mean he has to babysit
his retarded brother.

09:22.801 --> 09:24.806
Dad's freaked out about that girl
dragged aside from a window..

09:24.807 --> 09:27.706
He thinks there's some child murders
creeping the neighborhood or something.

09:28.599 --> 09:31.977
We go anyway. / Come on man, you know
my little brother. He's a dick in hotel.

09:32.478 --> 09:33.650
If I got caught drinking or anything else,

09:33.778 --> 09:38.950
..dad's not gonna pay for school.
I'll never get outta here. 

09:58.796 --> 10:02.424
Thanks for coming. Keep your food then
in kitchen, that'll be great.

10:21.485 --> 10:27.699
How are you doing, kiddo? /
It's delusion, isn't it?

10:29.034 --> 10:34.331
There's no up there. It makes you feel
better when someone died.

10:35.999 --> 10:42.839
I don't know. I mean there's no
fluffy clouds or winged angels.

10:44.758 --> 10:50.889
I think we go somewhere. I think
we go somewhere that not so far away...

10:51.390 --> 10:54.685
...that we still a part of those
who still here.

10:56.853 --> 10:59.606
Come on. Grab something
you can believe in.

You'll be okay.

Abra cadabra, Grandpa.

11:33.307 --> 11:36.261
Oh, did you ever find out who
ratted  you out at the McDowel's party?

11:36.307 --> 11:39.061
 Who else? Deputy dickhead Carl.

11:39.062 --> 11:43.858
Yeah. But you know the new girl, Julie? /
Oh yeah. / Yeah, who doesn't?

11:43.859 --> 11:45.852
Dude, Jake was calling, said she
got kicked out of her old school...

11:45.859 --> 11:47.862
..'cause she had sex with 
her English teacher.

11:47.863 --> 11:50.781
Oh yeah? I heard she was, uh..
doing coke in the bathroom.

11:50.782 --> 11:56.229
Oh, whatever. Apparently she has noticed
you hot stuff, and she wants to come.

11:56.730 --> 12:02.001
Where's that? / Open Hearth. She needs a big
strong guy like to keep her safe. / Open Hearth?

12:02.502 --> 12:07.298
Really? / Dude, what it is, works it out./
You're not scared, are you?

12:07.799 --> 12:10.135
Yeah, he is.

12:13.972 --> 12:18.225
What the fuck! What are you doing,
shitbrain? / Trimming the hedges, screw you!

12:18.226 --> 12:20.436
Hey, why don't you find your boy friend, then? /
He's not my boyfriend.

12:20.937 --> 12:26.401
She's a dyke, remember? / You know, Tracy,
do you spoke your mind, you'd be speechless.

12:28.820 --> 12:33.157
Give me, give me that. How long you've been, uh..
trimming the hedges? / I didn't hear anything.

12:33.658 --> 12:38.580
Yeah? I'll give you third eye
If I ever found out what you did. Got it?

12:44.628 --> 12:46.755
Come on, man. Let her go, dude.

12:56.807 --> 12:59.350
<i> What is she doing?</ i></i>

12:59.851 --> 13:02.187
<i> So disrecpectful..</ i></i>

13:12.864 --> 13:16.660
 ** Local Historian Dies at Age 86 **
Leads are not apparent according to police.

13:29.673 --> 13:31.883
What's with the flamethrower?

13:32.926 --> 13:36.805
My grandpa's.
Gave me all his magic stuff.

13:37.681 --> 13:41.601
What's this? /
A witch bottle. / A what?

13:42.644 --> 13:47.022
It's supposed to ward off the witch's spell.
Careful with it. It's fragile.

13:47.023 --> 13:50.068
Do you have any asshole bottles?
Might work on your brother.

13:51.528 --> 13:55.364
Idiot! /
I'm sorry seriously.

14:03.623 --> 14:08.753
Hey, wanna make a fun prank call? /
Fun when we were like what? 10? Grow up!

14:10.839 --> 14:16.720
Look, I was forced to grow out when I was about 6.
So, I'm gonna be a kid for as long as I can, all right?

14:20.265 --> 14:23.476
Any plans tomorrow night? /
My dad's working.

14:23.977 --> 14:27.731
Yeah, so is your brother.
Working something, anyway.

14:29.774 --> 14:34.987
If I say anything I'm dead. /
If you don't you're dead. / Okay. God.

He's going camping with Carter and Tracy
and some girl named Julie. Open Hearth.

14:41.661 --> 14:46.541
Open Hearth? / I heard that girl that was
kidnapped the other night was up there.

14:48.918 --> 14:52.755
She broke a window. /
It's just a myth for suckers.

14:53.256 --> 14:56.843
Your grandpa believe in it. /
He had done a lot of things that weren't real.

14:58.803 --> 15:03.307
"Season of the equinox,
the witch besets her kill."

15:03.808 --> 15:09.689
"One less soul the town to know,
taken against their will."

15:11.733 --> 15:16.782
Let's go up there. Take photos of your brother.
Something we can blackmail him.

15:16.783 --> 15:19.282
He'll never bother you again, I promise.

15:19.783 --> 15:22.951
They have cars, we have bikes. /
We cut through the woods.

15:22.952 --> 15:27.332
I'm not interested. /
Whatever!

15:46.267 --> 15:52.774
Why don't you go ask them if you can hang out? /
Please, a bunch of prissy snobs.

15:54.067 --> 15:58.113
Tell me if they ever make fun of you. /
Thanks, Doctor Freud. (wrong pronunciation)

16:01.366 --> 16:08.456
They think I'm a lesbian, just because I don't
wear <i>prada</i> or get a tit job.

16:09.749 --> 16:12.043
Are you?

16:13.461 --> 16:15.797
I'm not a lesbian, dick!

16:19.425 --> 16:21.636
Sam!

16:22.679 --> 16:24.973
By the way it's "Freud"! (correct pronunciation)

16:28.685 --> 16:34.065
<i>So Jake, you enjoy your last day at the mother nature?
You know you're missing Spring Equinox Festival. </i>

16:34.566 --> 16:37.363
Yeah, but you know me, Bob.
I'm not so good with people.

16:37.366 --> 16:40.363
<i>The town is buzzing about

<i>Her mother claimed she was taken right
from a window. You know what that means?</i>

16:46.119 --> 16:52.166
You know, if they just tear down that stupid house,
this whole witch legend, will die with it.

<i>Yeah, tell me about it. The police think
the estranged father took her for the weekend. </i>

Zack, anymore screw-ups, I'm not gonna pay
for your community college next year.

19:38.875 --> 19:42.294

I love you guys. /
I love you too.

19:51.095 --> 19:53.347
Keep the doors locked.

Why don't milk it a little bit more,
you pussy? / At least I care grandpa died.

20:05.109 --> 20:09.655
I care, I just don't use it as
a crutch. / Fuck you!

20:10.615 --> 20:15.327
You're supposed to stay home! /
That little bitch told you, didn't she?

20:15.828 --> 20:18.816
Hey, let me tell you something.
You say anything to anybody,

20:18.828 --> 20:21.916
..and I'll post that picture that I get you
jacking off in the bathroom. All over the internet.

20:21.917 --> 20:26.922
What picture? / Are you not in the bathroom
a couple nights ago, just.. whacking it?

20:27.423 --> 20:30.342
Like you don't do it. /
Yeah, it's better than you do.

20:30.843 --> 20:36.682
Just inbreds like you with no friends.
Pretty worth of it, it's all on Facebook. Okay?

20:37.892 --> 20:41.520
I wish it was you that died! /
Likewise.

20:44.440 --> 20:46.525
Likewise.

21:03.876 --> 21:06.962
Where'd you up to? /
Just coming home frome my shrink.

21:07.463 --> 21:13.010
She said you can be a real asshole sometimes. /
A shrink said that? / Yup.

21:14.178 --> 21:16.513
She's right.

21:17.014 --> 21:20.559
It doesn't matter.
We have plans tonight.

21:22.311 --> 21:25.814

We'll grab some sleeping bags. We camp.

21:32.655 --> 21:35.658
Unless you're scared ./
Scared of what?

Hey, Samantha, how is it going? /
Hey, Carl.

his shop yesterday. / It wasn't me. I don't smoke.

21:56.971 --> 22:00.181
Other kids just got it somehow, right? /
Leave her alone.

22:00.182 --> 22:02.810

Your mother's a drunk. And nobody knows who
your father is. You know what that means, right?

22:11.944 --> 22:13.366
It means when I finally nail your ass,

22:13.444 --> 22:17.866
..they're gonna ship  you out to a foster home
just as far away from here as they can.

22:17.867 --> 22:22.246
We haven't forgotten about all those
prank phone calls, shitsmirk.

22:23.831 --> 22:26.249
Paybacks are coming.
Trust me.

22:26.750 --> 22:32.548
You consider mouthwash, Carl? I don't know
what smells worse, your breath or your ass.

22:37.303 --> 22:39.972
I'm sorry about your grandpa.
I liked him.

22:41.640 --> 22:44.018
He didn't like you.

22:45.853 --> 22:51.233
I got a picture you're smoking dope while on duty.
That'll got you fired you know.

22:51.734 --> 22:54.528

So, what's this "Open Hearth" thing anyway? /
Oh, it's the name of the witch's house.

24:43.679 --> 24:46.034
Witch? / Yeah, it's used to be
thruth and dare.

24:46.079 --> 24:49.434
The trick was you had to get close enough
to throw a rock at the house.

24:49.935 --> 24:53.688
If you hit the house without breaking
any windows, then you would safe.

24:54.189 --> 24:57.275
And if you break a window? /
Then the wicked will get you.

24:57.776 --> 25:00.820
It's just bullshit, right?

25:01.321 --> 25:04.868
You know legend has it, that the witch and her cavern
were burnt by with hunter back in the day...

25:04.871 --> 25:06.868
..like, you know, a hundred years ago

Ladine Lorene. / Yeah, that's right.
Ladine Lorine. She survived.

You wanna know how? /
Yeah.

25:17.379 --> 25:22.008
She eats kids. Yeah, she eats kids.
She tears the limbs off.

25:22.009 --> 25:28.764
One by one. She start with their feet. And then
she rips off their legs. And she rips off their arms.

25:28.765 --> 25:33.769
And she eats every part of the body. And she
eats the little ones, you know, to keep her young.

25:33.770 --> 25:40.277
She eats the older ones to keep her strong.
Then she eats the pretty ones, just like you...

25:41.236 --> 25:44.197
..to keep her beautiful. /
That's ridiculous.

25:44.698 --> 25:50.244
"Season of the equinox the witch.." uh.. /
"Besets her kill." /

25:50.245 --> 25:54.207
Terima kasih. /
"One less soul the town to know"..

25:54.208 --> 25:58.002
.."taken against their will". /
Nice!

25:58.503 --> 26:00.755
It is time. Let's go.

26:01.256 --> 26:05.468
But, why doesn't it feel like a tradition?
I mean, why we're the only ones doing it?

26:05.469 --> 26:09.847
Well, apparently 15 years ago some kid
broke her window, and was never heard from again.

26:09.848 --> 26:14.644
Yeah, except he ran away to Florida or something. /
Dude, that's just what the cops want people to believe.

26:14.645 --> 26:16.966
Okay? What about those kids
who were hiking from long way?

26:16.975 --> 26:19.566
What, 4 years ago? Right?
No one found them.

26:20.067 --> 26:25.738
Yeah, well. They did searched the entire house.
It was abandoned. So.. / That's all part of her magic.

26:25.739 --> 26:27.494
Come on, man. Do you really believe that?

26:27.539 --> 26:31.994
Listen, all I'm saying is, there is a reason
that we should stop doing this.

26:31.995 --> 26:35.165
Whatever. Let's go.

26:41.463 --> 26:43.548
Road trip!

26:45.676 --> 26:49.845
Hey, what are you doing? / Taking a picture. I'm just
gonna put it on Facebook. / Are you retarded?

26:49.846 --> 26:54.935
I'm not supposed to be up here! / Stop it, okay?
Don't post anything. I have a class to show up.

26:56.728 --> 27:01.024
Oh, this is so freaking sad.
She's just like my little sister.

27:01.525 --> 27:06.988
I heard that she ran up with a bunch of kid,
and someone hit the window.

27:07.781 --> 27:10.658
You're freaking me out. / The cops went
to checked it out, it was empty.

27:10.659 --> 27:13.532
Oh, don't listen to him. That house
has freaking awsome mirrors.

27:13.559 --> 27:17.332
Oh my God, the creepiest thing, whenever
we tried to get back, those windows are fixed.

27:17.833 --> 27:21.460
Have you ever done it? /
Oh, yeah. We were 12.

27:21.461 --> 27:24.172
Zack backed out. /
I had excuses!

27:24.673 --> 27:30.720
Holy shit. I forgot that one. Show her your hand.
Come on, don't be embarrassed about. Just show her.

27:30.721 --> 27:32.931
I wanna see it.

27:36.685 --> 27:42.941
Why is that? / Well, my grandpa crashing
the bowling ball trying to do some magic trick.

27:43.442 --> 27:46.319
I became his favorite prop all over the show.

27:46.820 --> 27:49.823
Great grandfather. /
Yeah. Right.

27:59.249 --> 28:01.543
Sammy?

28:02.878 --> 28:05.714
Sammy!
Sammy!

28:15.557 --> 28:18.225
How much further? /
I think it's just ahead of us.

28:18.226 --> 28:20.353
You mean we're lost? /
We're not lost.

28:20.854 --> 28:27.610
We're in the middle of nowhere. /
You scared, aren't you? Come on.

29:01.896 --> 29:05.106
<i>Come on. / You wanna race? /
Come on.</i>

29:16.993 --> 29:19.788
Speeder Point.
Here it is.

29:31.259 --> 29:34.927
What do you think? / There is no
road from here to Open Hearth. So...

29:35.428 --> 29:39.640
Let's hike. It's just a few miles, right? /
You wanna hike tonight?

29:39.641 --> 29:45.605
Yeah, what are you, nervous? / No. I just
got the things in the dark I'd rather do.

29:46.564 --> 29:49.818
Oh, man. Check this out. Wow. /
Beautiful.

29:51.945 --> 29:55.990
I have probation. Probation. /
Are you sure? / Yeah.

29:55.991 --> 29:59.118
I think that's cool. /
What's cool?

29:59.619 --> 30:06.834
I like a guy who doesn't fall for peer pressure.
Just character. Or, you're being a total score.

30:06.835 --> 30:10.046
Come on. /
Try some.

30:15.343 --> 30:18.263
Ladies. /
Don't run away.

30:21.684 --> 30:25.770
So, what's up?  / So, are you
gonna sleep in the same tent?

30:27.313 --> 30:31.359
You're telling secrets already? /
Oh, my God.

30:31.860 --> 30:34.070
Okay, watch.

30:54.632 --> 30:56.968
That was good.

30:57.469 --> 31:02.639
Yeah, my grandpa was great at it. Everybody
was given out silver dires in Christmas.

31:02.640 --> 31:06.310
You still have one. / Yeah.

31:06.811 --> 31:09.355
He was really cool.

31:11.733 --> 31:16.571
Do you really think there is anything
after we die? / It has to be.

31:19.199 --> 31:25.788
You don't? / Biological.
It's like.. everything else.

31:28.416 --> 31:31.002
And when we die... we just..

31:31.503 --> 31:36.841
..just vapor. Energy.
Just like this flame.

31:41.095 --> 31:45.099
And do you think trees are gonna have it? /
Only if they're good.

31:45.600 --> 31:48.645
Otherwise, they're right to the chipper.

32:16.756 --> 32:19.008
I'm sorry.

32:22.428 --> 32:25.598
I thought you were lesbian. /
Shut up.

32:32.772 --> 32:36.484
Have you ever done it? /
Done it, done it?

32:36.985 --> 32:40.989
No. Have you? /
No.

32:50.790 --> 32:53.084
Just the pine cone, all right?

32:54.252 --> 32:56.796
You're scared of everything, aren't you?

33:29.662 --> 33:34.000
Aren't we supposed to be friends? /
So?

33:36.294 --> 33:40.923
I just don't wanna go all the way, for now.

33:44.260 --> 33:46.387
Okay.

33:49.307 --> 33:51.517
For now.

34:04.864 --> 34:07.533
I'm not a lesbian.

34:13.539 --> 34:15.666
You're kidding.

34:22.882 --> 34:25.259
Open Hearth.

34:31.474 --> 34:33.601
Did you hear that? /
Hear what?

34:37.563 --> 34:42.610
That's what I mean. Quiet.
All the bugs.

34:48.032 --> 34:50.326
All right. Let's get this over with.

34:54.746 --> 34:57.916
I wanna go back. /
Oh, someone's scared.

34:57.917 --> 35:00.127
I'm fucking scared shitless.

35:02.046 --> 35:04.297
I don't.. / Just take it. /
I don't want it.

35:04.298 --> 35:07.259
Come on, Tracy. We're all on this together. /
I don't want to.

35:07.260 --> 35:13.557
You did not drive me here for nothing, did you? /
Yes. / Okay, ready? / Count it down. / Okay.

35:13.558 --> 35:16.919
One, two, three!

35:20.398 --> 35:22.608
Oh, shit!

35:24.193 --> 35:27.238
Whose rock is that? /
We'll know soon enough.

35:29.824 --> 35:32.326
There's nothing to worry about.

35:34.537 --> 35:39.166
What? What the fuck! /
Guys! Guys!

35:40.668 --> 35:47.132
Guys, it was just the shadow of a tree.
Yes, it was. / Dude, I was pissed my pants.

35:49.927 --> 35:56.559
Jesus! Can we just go? / I think we probably
should. I think you're the one who broke the window.

35:57.476 --> 35:59.687
Damn it, you're a dick, Carter!

36:00.771 --> 36:05.318
We got a LOL. Ready? /
Yeah.

36:07.862 --> 36:10.781
Okay. Here we go.

36:27.631 --> 36:31.218
We're getting closer. /
Why do you say that?

36:35.848 --> 36:43.063
Do you think anyone actually died there?  /
That's witch's stake. They burned her there.

37:07.088 --> 37:10.091
Oh my God. They're gonna hear us.

37:12.676 --> 37:14.970
Good.

37:15.513 --> 37:20.726
Well, it must've been hard moving so far
before graduation. / Yeah, that is a thought.

37:22.228 --> 37:25.564
Well, you could improve those here.

37:31.195 --> 37:36.742
So, hey. Why did you get kicked out of school?
And you don't have to answer that.

37:37.243 --> 37:41.622
So you heard all those rumors. /
Some of them, yes.

37:46.293 --> 37:48.629
You wanna know what my big secret is?

37:49.588 --> 37:52.303
Because nobody knowing out what happened.

37:52.388 --> 37:56.303
But you have to promise to keep it
between us. 'Cause it's kinda embarrassing.

37:56.804 --> 38:01.600
Okay. /
My big secret is...

38:03.269 --> 38:05.187
..that I don't have one.

38:05.688 --> 38:07.276
I would, I just moved. I mean...

38:07.388 --> 38:11.276
the same thing that happened since 8th grade
when my dad got reassigning./ Seriously?

38:11.777 --> 38:13.558
Of course. You didn't sleep
with your English teacher?

38:13.577 --> 38:18.158
And I don't do coke, and then punch
my friend in the face.

38:18.659 --> 38:23.413
I can't even remember the other one. /
Wow, how boring.

38:23.914 --> 38:29.295
It is, isn't it? But, life is cute, isn't it,
'cause you joined the cold status.

38:36.844 --> 38:44.393
<i>Yeaah! Oh God! Oh God! </i> /
Oh God...

38:45.644 --> 38:49.857
That's my boy.  /
It's fun to have it.

38:52.609 --> 38:56.989
Don't do that. / You're gonna go in.
You're gonna go in. / Oh yeah?

39:04.663 --> 39:07.166
Did you hear that? /
What?

39:08.083 --> 39:10.544
You didn't hear that?

39:13.422 --> 39:15.716
It's just umm...

39:17.426 --> 39:19.553
It's something else.

39:25.142 --> 39:27.311
It's just the wind .

39:38.989 --> 39:41.200
That's not the witch, Zack.

39:50.375 --> 39:52.461
Do you wanna go swimming?

39:55.798 --> 39:58.675
I didn't bring a suite. So...

40:10.562 --> 40:16.693
I mean, unless you really think you melt.

40:40.592 --> 40:43.637
Julie? Julie!

40:54.606 --> 41:01.321
Did I scare you? / Not cool. / I thought
it's pretty funny. / No, it's not.

41:17.421 --> 41:20.048
Of course not, if we die.

41:21.800 --> 41:26.555
It's close, right? /
Not as scary as everyone says.

41:42.321 --> 41:44.615
I think they're here.

41:49.369 --> 41:54.666
You're gonna do it? To hit the window? /
 That's the point.

41:55.709 --> 42:00.172
Beside, how cool it be
to see a witch.

42:04.635 --> 42:06.803
You do it.

42:19.608 --> 42:21.735
Crap.

42:25.739 --> 42:27.824
See?

42:29.117 --> 42:31.411
Total gip.

42:37.834 --> 42:41.546
It's just the wind. /
What wind?

43:02.442 --> 43:05.070
We have to leave. /
What's that? Let's go.

43:06.488 --> 43:08.740
Oh, shit. Go, go!

43:33.098 --> 43:36.268
What's wrong? /
I thought I heard something.

44:29.613 --> 44:31.698
Amanda?

44:33.700 --> 44:36.494
Zack! / I'm sorry. /
Look at this.

44:38.246 --> 44:42.166
A teddy bear ? / Yeah. It wasn't here
before./ What are you talking about?

44:42.792 --> 44:47.547
Carter! Tracy! /
What the fuck! / Wake up!

44:49.716 --> 44:51.926
Look at this.
Look.

44:53.303 --> 44:56.389
It's hers, I just found it.

44:58.308 --> 45:02.728
Julie, this could be anybody's. / No, that's personalized
teddy bear. My little sister has the same one.

45:03.229 --> 45:06.565
Pretty funny coincidence, don't you think? /
Where did you find it?

45:06.566 --> 45:10.527
It was found it over there, but it wasn't there
before. / Well, obviously you just didn't see it.

45:10.528 --> 45:13.531
Or maybe someone came through here
with that little girl.

45:18.620 --> 45:20.288
Hey, what are you doing? /
I'm calling the police.

45:20.789 --> 45:24.375
Look, I'm screwed if they came by
figured that we're up here. / Seriously?

45:24.376 --> 45:27.962
That little girl is missing, and
you worried about getting into a trouble?

45:28.463 --> 45:32.383
I had reception area, what the hell. /
Look guys, I don't want rumors going around.

45:32.384 --> 45:36.220
My parents think that I'm staying
at Tanya's. / You guys are unbelievable!

45:36.721 --> 45:41.101
That little girl could be out there somewhere,
so alive. We have to look./ In the middle of the night?

45:41.935 --> 45:46.730
Maybe she's right. / What, really, lover boy?
Or it's just your dick talking?

45:46.731 --> 45:50.651
Fuck you. / Guys, I don't think it's a good idea
to go marching up to the woods.

45:51.152 --> 45:54.614
If you are right, that girl's kidnapper
could be out here.

45:55.115 --> 45:57.200
Fine. Then I go by myself.

46:01.037 --> 46:04.499
We're all go. Right?

46:17.804 --> 46:21.182
Where is she? / I don't know.
Take out your camera.

46:21.683 --> 46:24.309
Why? / To document it,
just in case.

46:24.310 --> 46:26.521
That's a good idea.

46:28.481 --> 46:32.442
You're on? / Yeah, yeah. Hurry up, it's gonna die./
Hi, I'm Max Reese at Open Hearth.

46:32.443 --> 46:35.488
If you find this, burn that house down.
The wicked is real!

46:35.989 --> 46:40.952
I broke a window. Then uh..
something came out of the house.

47:11.524 --> 47:13.985
Hairstrap from the picture.

47:17.614 --> 47:20.700
What was her name again? /
Amanda.

47:37.926 --> 47:42.204
This is creepy.
Can we just go?

47:45.141 --> 47:49.562
Julie! Go get her!
She's your date!

47:55.693 --> 48:00.572
Julie, what are you doing? / It's empty./
No shit. Let's get outta here.

48:00.573 --> 48:05.494
No. That teddy bear didn't just get up there
by itself. Someone kidnapped that girl.

48:05.995 --> 48:08.877
That's what kidnappers do.
Listen you have to call the police.

48:08.895 --> 48:12.877
I don't want to get any trouble.
Let's just get outta here. Come on.

48:15.171 --> 48:17.298
Julie.

48:51.207 --> 48:53.250
Did you hear that? /
No.

48:53.751 --> 48:58.673
Well, it sounded like somebody's crying./
No, it didn't.

49:05.263 --> 49:08.140
This is all a gag, isn't it? /
What?

49:08.641 --> 49:12.907
Carter placed that teddy bear out there.
You guys are just messing with me. Right?

49:12.941 --> 49:16.607
Very funny, Julie. You got me.
Let's go. Come on.

49:22.738 --> 49:26.826
Probably just the pipes. /
Yeah, the pipes.

49:31.914 --> 49:34.125
Julie.

49:36.627 --> 49:39.505
We have to pin it and get down there.

49:48.723 --> 49:50.975
Zack.

49:51.934 --> 49:54.145
Zack, I found it.

50:16.417 --> 50:18.586
You go look, Zack.

50:19.795 --> 50:23.466
You go look. /
Seriously?

50:27.303 --> 50:31.849
No, no. Okay. I'll go.
Just wait here.

50:47.949 --> 50:51.744
Where did they go? /
Maybe they ran inside the house?

51:05.049 --> 51:08.719
Oh, shit.

51:35.955 --> 51:41.168
I think I heard something upstairs. / What? /
There's something in the house up there.

51:41.669 --> 51:44.672
Are you serious? /
Yes.

52:06.110 --> 52:08.404
Carter, look.

52:22.001 --> 52:24.211
Hold this.

52:27.756 --> 52:30.551
Okay. Somebody's down there.

52:32.761 --> 52:35.055
Yes, yeah..

52:37.808 --> 52:40.186
Flashlight. /
Here.

52:44.648 --> 52:47.067
Oh my God! /
It's her.

52:49.153 --> 52:52.490
I'll get her hold up.
Guess it'll be easy.

52:55.784 --> 52:57.995
Good luck.

53:12.009 --> 53:14.010
Okay. All right.

53:14.511 --> 53:18.599
It's okay.
It's okay.

53:20.351 --> 53:23.854
It's okay.

53:27.733 --> 53:33.782
Okay. Get your feet up. No, no, no. It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you. Okay?

53:33.783 --> 53:35.282
We'll get you outta here.
You ready to go?

53:35.450 --> 53:41.830
Yeah? You're going to hold on this.
I'll carry you out. Okay? Come on now.

53:46.168 --> 53:49.922
I'm right behind you. She's coming up.
She's almost there.

53:51.382 --> 53:55.135
You got her?  You got her? /
I got her.

53:58.389 --> 54:01.558
Okay.
It's okay.

54:10.734 --> 54:12.903
No, no, no, no, no..

54:14.321 --> 54:16.490
No...

54:30.504 --> 54:32.756
Where are they?

54:38.595 --> 54:41.181
Zack, get us outta here!

54:44.393 --> 54:46.769
They're trying to get out. /
Wait, wait. It might not be them.

54:46.770 --> 54:50.649
But what if it is? /
I'm not going near that goddamn house.

54:52.317 --> 54:54.403
Fine. I am.

55:05.164 --> 55:08.542
Zack! /
I know! I know!

55:10.127 --> 55:12.337
Come on!

55:32.357 --> 55:36.195
Wait! We're running in circles.
We need a plan.

55:39.281 --> 55:44.160
It's her? What about the dude that took her?
He'll get coming after us.

55:44.661 --> 55:48.749
It's not a him.
It's the witch.

55:50.959 --> 55:52.627
What? /
It's not a ghost story, Carter.

55:53.128 --> 55:56.260
Right over there is graveyard
of camping shit, back down that house.

55:56.328 --> 56:00.260
Okay, she was in that cellar
wrapped in some cocoon or something.

56:04.598 --> 56:07.643
It comes from the camp. /
Shit, my car!

56:10.854 --> 56:13.857
Listen. I'll bring him back.
You're gonna stay with her. Keep her safe.

56:29.248 --> 56:33.835
Dude, my car is gone. /
Dude, everything is gone.

56:42.803 --> 56:47.014
You're just gonna leave us here?
Can we go to the truck, please?

56:47.015 --> 56:50.310
There is no truck.
Somebody stole it.

56:50.811 --> 56:54.105
She wants it. The girl. /
Are you believing this shit?

56:54.106 --> 56:56.987
It's real, Carter. We need to keep going.
We need to get outta here.

56:56.996 --> 56:59.987
How are we gonna do that, genius?
It's 10 miles to the nearest town.

57:00.862 --> 57:04.300
What about that Ranger station? I mean,
the one we saw on the way down here.

57:04.362 --> 57:06.200
I mean, they might have phone or something.

57:06.201 --> 57:11.081
That's still 4 miles away. / You wanna wait here
for the witch to get you? Cause she's coming.

57:12.416 --> 57:14.793
Carter, can we just go?

57:17.170 --> 57:22.550
All right. Witch or not, whoever took her,
it is probably pissed off. So yeah, let's get outta here.

57:23.051 --> 57:26.513
Hey, wait a second. / What? /
Well, look!

57:27.014 --> 57:29.850
What is that? /
It's Max's bike.

57:33.478 --> 57:37.064
I mean, he must just followed us up here. /
That little prick took the car!

57:37.065 --> 57:39.609
Without the keys, Carter?

57:40.527 --> 57:44.656
Max! Max! /
Shut up, dude.

57:50.912 --> 57:53.081
What is it?

58:06.887 --> 58:09.222
Look at this.

58:12.642 --> 58:16.645
Look at that. / He's probably a half way home
with shit stain on underwear.

58:16.646 --> 58:20.316
What if he were not?
I'm gonna back to the house and find him.

58:20.817 --> 58:24.863
You could do it on your own. /
I'm not asking you, Carter. Am I?

58:30.410 --> 58:34.622
Zack. You can't go back there.

58:35.123 --> 58:37.959
Would you leave your little sister up here?

58:40.212 --> 58:44.800
Listen, I can't just do that. Just call
the police and get her some help.

58:51.723 --> 58:53.642
Fuck it!

59:09.199 --> 59:12.827
Okay, can we just slow it down? /
Yeah, yeah. You do whatever you want.

59:13.328 --> 59:16.456
You don't have to be such an ass, okay?

59:18.041 --> 59:25.256
She's here. The wicked. /
Wait a minute. What? What did you say?

59:27.092 --> 59:32.889
She's already here. / Who? Who's already
here? What are you talking about?

59:51.658 --> 59:53.702
Shit.

01:00:11.052 --> 01:00:15.640
Tracy? /
Julie?

01:00:21.896 --> 01:00:24.024
Julie?

01:01:45.647 --> 01:01:47.487
What are you doing, Zack?

01:01:47.497 --> 01:01:52.987
Calm, they're not here. Let's go back
and catch up with the others.

01:02:01.079 --> 01:02:03.289
She got Max.

01:02:49.836 --> 01:02:53.839
Where is he, Sammy? / She hides
him inside. Zack, we've gotta get him...

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:58.760
Listen to me. Hey, when we travel
back here, there's a county road nineteenth.

01:02:58.761 --> 01:03:01.584
There's a ranger station about a half../
We've gotta save him.. / Sammy!

01:03:01.591 --> 01:03:04.684
There's a phone there.
I need you to call for help.

01:03:05.476 --> 01:03:10.231
Listen to me, shitbrain.
I'm gonna get Max. Trust me.

01:03:11.733 --> 01:03:14.360
I need you to go.
Go, Sammy.

01:03:39.761 --> 01:03:41.637
Go.

01:04:58.714 --> 01:05:00.675
I'm coming, Max!

01:05:05.721 --> 01:05:10.893
I want my mommy. / It's okay, we...
we have to keep going.

01:05:16.482 --> 01:05:18.359
Come on. Come on.

01:06:36.646 --> 01:06:41.567
Carl, you've gotta take a look at this. /
No, thanks. I don't feel like to throwing up today.

01:06:42.068 --> 01:06:45.363
So the chinese call "The great wall of vagina".

01:06:46.906 --> 01:06:51.786
Have you been to China? / That's the size
the point. Just take a look at it.

01:06:55.998 --> 01:06:58.542
Is that legal? /
In what country?

01:06:59.043 --> 01:07:01.962
You pig. Button up your shirt.

01:07:04.131 --> 01:07:06.592
I'd like to "Mao Tse-Tongue" that.

01:07:31.909 --> 01:07:37.456
Baker County Sheriff Department? / <i>I, I need help.
All right. My friend.. my friend has been kidnapped. </i>

01:07:37.957 --> 01:07:42.544
Listen. There's this woman she's..
She has my friends and she's going to kill them.

01:07:43.045 --> 01:07:46.340
Hey, Carl. Carl, this voice sounds
familiar to you?

01:07:46.841 --> 01:07:52.596
<i> She dragged him into the basement or something,
I don't know. He's alive. Please. You've gotta help us.</i>

01:07:54.306 --> 01:07:59.144
Samantha? Hey, great to hear from you.
Sorry about your problem.

01:07:59.645 --> 01:08:07.235
We're gonna head over right now. Yeah, yeah.
We're on our way to.. That's a cop car. All right.

01:08:07.236 --> 01:08:09.196
Red roger. Squad's ready to run.

01:10:31.839 --> 01:10:34.715
Baker County Sheriff Department? /
<i>Listen, don't hang up. </i>

01:10:34.716 --> 01:10:40.930
Listen to me, you little fuck. We don't have time for this.
You do realize, prank 911 phone call is federal offence.

01:10:40.931 --> 01:10:46.644
Yes, you damn bitch. Which this time is not a joke. /
Yeah. Well, good bye! / <i>Wait, Mahoney, wait!</i>

01:10:46.645 --> 01:10:50.341
You know who this is, right?
<i>I admit to everything. </i>

01:10:50.345 --> 01:10:52.651
<i>I'm the one who use to make
all these prank phone calls.</i>

01:10:53.735 --> 01:10:57.276
Tell Carl, if he'll come and arrest me.
Tell him, tell him..

01:10:57.289 --> 01:11:01.576
<i>I'm gonna post that picture from getting eyed
all over the internet. I swear to God I'll do it.</i>

01:11:02.744 --> 01:11:07.250
Hey, you little shit! <i>Kid, listen. This is
all on tape. When you do show your face..</i>

01:11:07.284 --> 01:11:09.250
<i>..you're going to juvenile halt.</i>

01:11:09.751 --> 01:11:13.090
Do you know what happens to deputy
to get cought doing drugs?

01:11:13.095 --> 01:11:16.090
You're not gonna get a job working
security in a graveyard.

01:11:16.091 --> 01:11:19.011
<i>Too bad you didn't trace
this call, deputy dickhead.</i>

01:11:22.181 --> 01:11:29.604
Get her location. / Yo, Carl, she's fucking with you.
She's fucking with you. Just let it go. Just let it go.

01:11:34.818 --> 01:11:37.070
Thank you, Debbie.

01:13:05.867 --> 01:13:08.245
Come here. Come on.
Come on.

01:14:26.531 --> 01:14:28.742
Zack...

01:15:56.830 --> 01:15:59.124
Come on.

01:17:31.466 --> 01:17:33.676
Go!

01:17:34.928 --> 01:17:37.138
Come on!

01:17:46.731 --> 01:17:49.192
Hallway, let's go!
Hallway, go!

01:18:06.584 --> 01:18:08.753
Max, let's go. Let's go!

01:18:12.799 --> 01:18:15.009
She won't let us out.

01:18:16.552 --> 01:18:19.514
There, upstairs. Come on.

01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:27.563
Ready? Come on.
One, two, three.

01:18:30.233 --> 01:18:32.860
That's her. / Go, go! /
One, two..

01:19:05.018 --> 01:19:08.688
Look at there!
Come out here.

01:19:09.689 --> 01:19:15.360
Somewhere outta here. / Who with? / A witch. /
Halloween's up another 5 months.

01:19:15.361 --> 01:19:19.335
You don't understand, Carl.
They're going to die!

01:19:19.361 --> 01:19:23.535
You don't understand. You have no idea
how badly I wanted to bring you back brute.

01:19:23.536 --> 01:19:27.581
You're hurting me! / Just a little bruises
for a little girl who's very bad.

01:19:27.582 --> 01:19:30.209
They're at Open Hearth, Carl. I'm serious! /
I'm not gonna like that, though.

01:19:30.710 --> 01:19:35.255
And I'm gonna enjoy watching you rot
in juvenile halt.. / Carl, listen!

01:19:35.256 --> 01:19:37.554
All those stories about
the wicked, they're all true.

01:19:37.556 --> 01:19:41.554
The witch, she.. she's somewhere
out there. She's going to kill them!

01:19:42.513 --> 01:19:45.308
You have the right to remain silent!

01:19:47.268 --> 01:19:51.647
Find another way! Find another way!
God!

01:19:55.610 --> 01:19:58.237
Zack. Zack!

01:20:00.072 --> 01:20:03.534
Go, go, go, go!
Go, Max!

01:20:07.747 --> 01:20:11.000
You all right in there?
Go, go, go, go!

01:20:11.834 --> 01:20:14.837
She's coming, come on!

01:20:15.338 --> 01:20:17.924
Zack! Zack!

01:20:22.637 --> 01:20:24.889
Anyone there, help!

01:20:29.727 --> 01:20:35.191
Come on! Help us!
Come on, what's wrong with you?

01:20:47.662 --> 01:20:52.917
They did it. We're okay, Amanda.

01:20:56.587 --> 01:20:59.465
What the hell happened down here?
You guys all right?

01:21:54.770 --> 01:21:58.941
No! No! No! No! /
Max!

01:21:59.442 --> 01:22:04.696
Max, Max. It's me,
Max! It's me. / Zack!

01:22:10.911 --> 01:22:13.122
To the tree.
Come on.

01:22:16.625 --> 01:22:19.503
We've gotta break her spells. /
How?

01:22:20.004 --> 01:22:24.925
I don't know. /
Wait a second.

01:22:25.426 --> 01:22:30.639
Grandpa always talked abouth witches and shit, right? /
Yeah./ I mean, I never believed in these, but you did.

01:22:31.807 --> 01:22:34.893
Grandpa never said anything to you? /
Nothing ever help.

01:22:35.394 --> 01:22:37.957
All right, listen to me. She can't move
in place at once, right?

01:22:37.994 --> 01:22:40.357
I don't know, she can do fucking anything.

01:22:40.858 --> 01:22:47.238
Listen to me. This is what we're gonna do.
When it's quiet, you follow that road to Speeder Point.

01:22:47.239 --> 01:22:50.477
No, we've gotta to stay together. /
We can't stay together, Max. Listen to me.

01:22:50.489 --> 01:22:52.077
We stay together, she's going to get us both.

01:22:52.578 --> 01:22:57.966
I'm fucking afraid, Zack. / Listen, dont' be.
Grandpa's watching over us, right? Right?

01:22:59.293 --> 01:23:03.505
He is, Max. And you should
believe that, Max.

01:23:04.006 --> 01:23:07.993
That's all. Remember when
it gets quiet. Just go.

01:23:09.929 --> 01:23:14.892
You can do this. You can do this,
we're almost home. We're almost home.

01:23:18.771 --> 01:23:23.400
Zack! / Come on,
you stupid bitch! Come here!

01:23:37.498 --> 01:23:43.920
Turn around, you dick! / Everything
you say can and will be used against you.

01:23:43.921 --> 01:23:48.217
Just take a look, that's all I'm asking.
Just drive up there.

01:23:49.176 --> 01:23:53.180
I'm not wasting my time.
So, shut your fucking mouth.

01:23:54.557 --> 01:23:59.269
<i> Unit 221, Base, over. </i> /
This is Carl, what is it?

01:23:59.270 --> 01:24:03.690
<i>You're not gonna believe this.
Julie Ramm found Amanda Drake, alive.</i>

01:24:03.691 --> 01:24:09.113
<i>And on top of that, we got a dead ranger near Speeder
Point. He was found with his throat ripped open.</i>

01:24:10.656 --> 01:24:13.242
<i>What am I gonna do, Carl? </i>

01:24:18.163 --> 01:24:20.541
Mahoney, I'll get it back to you.

01:24:22.751 --> 01:24:28.007
I swear to God, it's not a joke, Carl. Please..

01:24:32.636 --> 01:24:35.723
Mahoney, meet me at the Open Hearth.

01:25:23.854 --> 01:25:29.651
Yo, Carl. What the hell is going on here? /
Stay here. Watch the truck.

01:25:52.216 --> 01:25:57.971
Baker County Sheriff Department.
Anyone here?

01:26:24.081 --> 01:26:26.249
<i> Base, 221. </ i></i>

01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:31.504
Investigating Open Hearth property about
a half miles south of Speeder Point. Stand by.

01:26:31.505 --> 01:26:33.632
<i>Stand forth, 221. </i>

01:26:35.467 --> 01:26:43.350
What is going on here? Why are we out here?
It is late and I wanna go home.

01:27:14.047 --> 01:27:16.466
Mahoney.

01:27:23.849 --> 01:27:26.059
Mahoney.

01:27:32.733 --> 01:27:34.860
Please, look.

01:27:45.621 --> 01:27:47.497
Oh, fuck!

01:27:58.967 --> 01:28:01.261
Carl, get your ass up here.

01:28:02.637 --> 01:28:04.723
Mahoney?

01:28:12.647 --> 01:28:14.608
Carl.

01:30:09.222 --> 01:30:13.894
Dispatch 221. There is nothing here. /
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:42.631
That kid got me again.

01:31:08.782 --> 01:31:10.575
Carl?

01:31:35.183 --> 01:31:40.563
Max! Max, please. Get up. Get up.
Please... / I can't...

01:31:41.815 --> 01:31:44.025
She poisoned me.

01:31:47.821 --> 01:31:50.240
You have to. Come on.

01:31:56.913 --> 01:31:59.958
Shit. Mahoney?
Mahoney?

01:32:07.090 --> 01:32:12.637
Base, 221. Officer down.
Please respond immediately...

01:32:57.390 --> 01:32:59.642
<i>Come on, Max!</i>

01:33:10.778 --> 01:33:13.364
Just leave me. /
No way.

01:33:59.369 --> 01:34:01.329
Zack!

01:34:10.254 --> 01:34:12.674
Come on. Come on.

01:34:14.676 --> 01:34:17.970
She's in the hallway.
We're never gonna get pass her.

01:34:21.516 --> 01:34:24.143
Witch bottles? /
What?

01:34:24.644 --> 01:34:28.480
Like the one grandpa gave me.
The only way to ward off the witch's spell.

01:34:28.981 --> 01:34:32.045
What do you do with it? /
Put something of yourself in it.

01:34:32.081 --> 01:34:34.945
Uh.. hair, nail clipping, blood,
anything. The repelling spell.

01:34:34.946 --> 01:34:40.326
Then why would she had it? /
She's using them too.

01:34:40.827 --> 01:34:43.538
That's how she stayed safe.
They protect her.

01:34:44.622 --> 01:34:49.793
It's gonna be more powerful than hair, right?/ At this
point, I'll take a crap in it, if it worked. Just hurry!

01:34:49.794 --> 01:34:52.088
Give me your hand.

01:35:20.199 --> 01:35:24.162
It worked! / Come on! /
We've gotta stop her!

01:35:41.679 --> 01:35:43.931
Let's go!

01:36:14.837 --> 01:36:17.048
It's not working.

01:36:34.857 --> 01:36:37.902
Max.. witch's burn.

01:37:03.052 --> 01:37:05.137
Max.

01:37:07.807 --> 01:37:10.309
Abra cadabra, you ugly bitch!

01:38:52.578 --> 01:38:59.459
Zack? / Julie.
It's okay. It's all right.

01:39:07.301 --> 01:39:09.511
Have you seen Carter?

01:39:13.557 --> 01:39:17.185
And the witch, Zack?

01:39:17.686 --> 01:39:19.813
Dad.

01:39:33.327 --> 01:39:36.956
Dad...
This is Julie.

01:39:41.585 --> 01:39:45.233
You guys absolutely sure
there's someone in that house?

01:39:45.285 --> 01:39:48.633
Yeah. We set her on fire.
We trapped her in the cellar.

01:39:48.634 --> 01:39:52.513
Well, there's no other bodies
in that house. There's nothing.

01:39:53.806 --> 01:39:57.433
That means she got away. /
No, she didn't get away.

01:39:57.434 --> 01:39:59.774
I have a 10 mile radius set-up
and block around here.

01:39:59.775 --> 01:40:03.774
If there's anybody out there,
she won't get far. Trust me.

01:40:13.826 --> 01:40:16.036
House and mirrors.

01:40:32.761 --> 01:40:37.765
<i>Even if the festival continued with a good news,
that 7 year old Amanda Drake is recovering.. <i></i></i>

01:40:37.766 --> 01:40:40.397
<i>...and has been upgraded
to fair condition, </i>

01:40:40.466 --> 01:40:44.897
<i>..we are hearing that the suspect
has still not been found and remains at large.</i>

01:40:44.898 --> 01:40:50.945
<i>The house where it all took place, of course,
has been a piece of local folklore for generations.</i>

01:40:50.946 --> 01:40:55.867
<i>Bit local kids insisting the legend is true.
And that Ladine Lorene..</i>

01:40:55.868 --> 01:40:59.662
<i>..is in fact, a witch.
And still very much alive.</i>

01:40:59.663 --> 01:41:03.545
<i>It seems awhole new generations of children
are being frighten into believing, </i>

01:41:03.563 --> 01:41:07.045
<i>..that the wicked is just
outside their window.</i>
