<i>The human brain is remarkable.</i>

00:06.173 --> 00:08.675
<i>For nine years
I thought I'd lost my watch</i>

00:08.759 --> 00:11.053
<i>cos I can't remember
which wrist it's on.</i>

00:11.136 --> 00:13.138
<i>And yet, after two weeks,</i>

00:13.222 --> 00:19.102
<i>the things that scared me at first,
catheters, chest tubes, IVs...</i>

00:19.186 --> 00:21.647
<i>Everything has started to click.</i>

01:25.419 --> 01:29.464
Are you?
lf you have time to listen to music,

01:29.548 --> 01:33.719
then l assume you have time
to finish your paperwork.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.562
Keep moving.

02:05.042 --> 02:07.669
<i>That work day
started like every other.</i>

02:12.174 --> 02:16.428
- How's it goin'?
- l'm a 37-year-old janitor.

02:16.512 --> 02:17.971
How d'you think it's going?

02:18.055 --> 02:20.724
There is nothing wrong
with being a janitor.

02:20.807 --> 02:25.479
Really? Thank you,
you've turned my life around.

02:25.562 --> 02:30.234
l'll tell my janitor wife and all our
janitor kids that life is worth living.

02:30.317 --> 02:35.072
And that comes straight from our hero,
Dr Whozits, Dr Nothing.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.740
No, seriously, come on.

02:36.823 --> 02:41.119
Come over to my humble house and
point out things that are cheap.

02:41.203 --> 02:44.081
<i>Luckily, I had the night off to regroup.</i>

02:46.208 --> 02:50.337
- That dog is creepy.
- Be nice to Rowdy.

02:50.420 --> 02:54.049
The guy we bought him from kept
him in a box full of old hats.

02:57.094 --> 02:59.179
Why is she here all the time?

02:59.263 --> 03:03.934
- Just give her a chance, man.
- You want to hit that.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.519
- No!
- Yeah!

03:05.602 --> 03:08.522
She's just a friend.

03:08.605 --> 03:13.652
lt's healthy, hanging out with a girl
without the ultimate goal being sex.

03:13.735 --> 03:17.155
- You know?
- l'm not following.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.078
Creepy. l had a run-in
with that nurse, Carla.

03:23.161 --> 03:26.707
She forgot to check the stats
on a patient and gave me attitude.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.584
Did you tell on her?

03:28.667 --> 03:32.296
- Who's responsible for this?
- She is.

03:33.547 --> 03:37.467
l don't remember.
Why do you assume it was my fault?

03:37.551 --> 03:40.971
<i>It'd be a good point, except Elliot
puts her foot in her mouth.</i>

03:41.054 --> 03:43.974
<i>A lot.
She can't really seem to stop.</i>

03:44.057 --> 03:47.728
Just because l occasionally
say something stupid doesn't mean

03:47.811 --> 03:53.275
l go door-to-door annoying people,
like some crazed Jehovah's Witness.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.069
- You're not?
- No.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.864
My mother is.

04:00.616 --> 04:03.869
He's black, too.
You should tease him about that.

04:03.952 --> 04:08.165
<i>I'm doing better with new people.
Like Carla, for instance.</i>

04:08.248 --> 04:11.543
Bambi, that blonde stick
you hang out with? Tell her...

04:16.005 --> 04:18.466
You might have to
write that down for me.

04:18.550 --> 04:22.387
<i>And Dr Cox. We've really connected.
I'm kind of like his protégé.</i>

04:22.471 --> 04:26.141
- l need to see his chart...
- Done, copied and highlighted.

04:26.225 --> 04:30.229
Unfortunately, radar,
l'm fresh out of gold stars.

04:31.104 --> 04:34.233
Multilobar pneumonia at 31 .
How much does he smoke?

04:34.316 --> 04:36.068
l don't know.

04:36.151 --> 04:39.279
lt's your attention to detail
that impresses me most.

04:41.365 --> 04:44.493
- How many packs a day, genius?
- Half a pack.

04:44.576 --> 04:47.621
l'm sorry.
l phrased the question wrong.

04:47.704 --> 04:50.165
How many packs a day, really?

04:50.249 --> 04:52.251
Eleven.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.545
You don't know where l'm coming from.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.880
Two or three packs.

04:57.673 --> 04:59.550
Let's hear it.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.177
l don't smoke so... Zero packs.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.765
What tests have you ordered?

05:06.849 --> 05:09.852
l was just...
l was totally kidding with you.

05:09.935 --> 05:12.145
He was. We're all in on it.

05:12.229 --> 05:15.941
<i>I like Will. That makes this harder.</i>

05:16.024 --> 05:19.319
l ordered blood cultures
and a high-resolution CT.

05:19.403 --> 05:22.114
What are you looking for?

05:24.032 --> 05:25.117
Cancer.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.912
<i>When you say ''cancer, ''
every person reacts the same way.</i>

05:28.996 --> 05:31.623
<i>- Excellent.
- Not like that.</i>

05:33.709 --> 05:35.127
<i>There it is.</i>

05:36.753 --> 05:40.716
<i>I never know what to say to
Turk's buddies. But I'm getting better.</i>

05:40.799 --> 05:42.593
So...

05:42.676 --> 05:45.470
- How's surgery?
- lt rocks.

05:45.554 --> 05:50.350
But my bedroom, that's where
l really operate. Am l right?

05:50.434 --> 05:54.354
<i>- Come on, show Todd some love!
- I hate showing Todd love.</i>

05:56.607 --> 05:59.735
Bambi, why are you slumming
with these scalpel jocks?

05:59.818 --> 06:03.030
Please, baby.
This here's the VlP table.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.575
Why don't you
sit your fine self down?

06:09.036 --> 06:12.247
''Baby, this here's the VlP table...''

06:12.331 --> 06:14.750
l'm not really interested in her.

06:14.833 --> 06:19.796
Then the Todd'll show
that little biscuit some love.

06:23.467 --> 06:25.677
<i>Maybe he's a bit interested.</i>

06:25.761 --> 06:29.264
Fine. Todd'll show himself some love.

06:31.975 --> 06:34.102
l'm going to ask Carla out.

06:34.186 --> 06:38.232
- l think the janitor's out to get me.
- Thank you so much for your help.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.400
Why not be a bit more paranoid?

06:40.484 --> 06:43.362
- Wait, Turk...
- That's him.

06:49.368 --> 06:51.370
Hi, how are you?

06:53.163 --> 06:56.250
l need David Farr's chart.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.794
We all need lots of things.

06:58.877 --> 07:01.964
Great. Dr Kelso?
You're the Chief of Medicine.

07:02.047 --> 07:05.759
ls there a special way
to communicate with nursing staff?

07:05.843 --> 07:10.013
Sugar won't work.
They're already so sweet.

07:11.682 --> 07:14.768
Now, listen,
Dr Whatever-the-hell-your-name-is,

07:14.852 --> 07:17.312
you tattled yesterday, l responded.

07:17.396 --> 07:21.191
l feel closer to you than ever.
But the ramifications are yours.

07:21.275 --> 07:25.571
Don't drag me into your pathetic,
whiny, little squabble

07:25.654 --> 07:29.366
with that bunch of malcontents.
l hope you all kill each other.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.577
Have a great day, ladies.

07:35.664 --> 07:37.833
l hate this place.

07:37.916 --> 07:41.003
Dr Cox, l got Will's CT results back.

07:41.086 --> 07:44.006
No cancer.
So what shall l tell him?

07:44.089 --> 07:45.716
l'd open with that.

07:45.799 --> 07:49.469
He's headed down such a bad road,
maybe we could talk to him...

07:49.553 --> 07:53.682
<i>When you have a mentor, you understand
the meaning behind their words.</i>

07:53.765 --> 07:57.227
<i>- You do whatever you want.
- Means ''Great idea''.</i>

07:57.311 --> 08:00.314
l'm just happy
you haven't messed up yet today.

08:00.397 --> 08:03.358
<i>Means ''You're really
coming along as a doctor''.</i>

08:03.442 --> 08:08.405
<i>- Don't ever touch me.
- Means ''Don't ever touch him''.</i>

08:09.489 --> 08:11.575
Just thought it was a nice moment.

08:14.077 --> 08:17.206
- l don't wanna.
- Come on.

08:19.875 --> 08:23.879
Carla, l shouldn't have
told Dr Kelso on you.

08:23.962 --> 08:26.465
No, you shouldn't have.

08:28.091 --> 08:30.135
<i>Comfortable silences.</i>

08:30.219 --> 08:33.554
But thank you for apologising.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.517
Good.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.852
- l wanna make one thing clear.
- Nothing needs to be clear.

08:41.063 --> 08:43.398
l still think you were in the wrong.

08:43.482 --> 08:48.237
Checking orthostatics is your job.
l need to know you'll take care of it.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.740
That's all l'm saying.

08:52.950 --> 08:55.452
There. All better.

08:57.371 --> 09:01.041
As of now,
you have no signs of cancer.

09:01.124 --> 09:03.502
Who rules? Will rules.

09:03.585 --> 09:06.046
This isn't great news.

09:06.129 --> 09:08.966
Are you sure?
That's how it first hit me.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.134
You're on a slippery slope.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.054
<i>I had to scare him but
I sensed he'd heard it before.</i>

09:14.137 --> 09:17.432
<i>Part of being a doctor
is your ability to improvise.</i>

09:17.516 --> 09:20.853
Right now, the one thing
l want you to think about...

09:22.312 --> 09:25.774
<i>How would you like to sound like this?</i>

09:25.858 --> 09:27.943
Let me see.

09:30.362 --> 09:33.365
<i>- This is so cool.
- No, it's not.</i>

09:33.448 --> 09:36.785
<i>- Biddy, biddy, biddy.
- lt's not a toy.</i>

09:38.161 --> 09:40.581
<i>Would you like to play a game?</i>

09:40.664 --> 09:43.208
<i>Sometimes,
if all you have is old words,</i>

09:43.292 --> 09:46.503
<i>all you can do is
hope they say something new.</i>

09:46.587 --> 09:49.840
Look, man. You're a great patient.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.467
l like you enough
to hope l never see you again.

09:52.551 --> 09:55.387
But if you keep smoking,
you'll be back here.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.141
l bet my own life on that.

10:02.811 --> 10:08.609
<i>Dr Reid to Room 402, then down
to 20 1, then back up to Room 403.</i>

10:17.075 --> 10:19.161
l'm nervous, man.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.914
l'm your wing man.
l will not leave your side.

10:21.997 --> 10:24.791
- Hey, baby.
- Keep moving, frat boy.

10:26.126 --> 10:30.839
- Come on. Out with it.
- Don't rush me.

10:30.923 --> 10:32.633
l mean...

10:32.716 --> 10:37.054
You shouldn't be impatient
with the opportunity of a lifetime.

10:38.222 --> 10:43.810
l'm gonna sit down because
you're so sexy? My knees are weak.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.271
Really?

10:46.355 --> 10:48.440
Dr Cox?
l know l'm being annoying,

10:48.524 --> 10:50.984
but l'm getting used
to talking to patients.

10:51.068 --> 10:53.946
This is why l became a doctor, right?

10:54.029 --> 10:57.574
l heard, ''l know l'm being
annoying'' and then white noise.

10:57.658 --> 11:00.410
Will, l got him to quit smoking.

11:00.494 --> 11:04.081
For ever? No last one?
The last ones are better than sex.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.250
Trust me, l've had 1 ,000 of them.

11:06.333 --> 11:10.504
Done forever, he swore to me.
l reached him. l reached him.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.179
You're having a big day, there, Susan.

11:24.142 --> 11:26.228
Private party.

11:32.526 --> 11:35.571
<i>Gotta get right back on the horse.</i>

11:35.654 --> 11:37.739
- Dr Cox, about Will.
- Not now!

11:37.823 --> 11:40.659
l've a 1 0-minute break
and my soap is on.

11:41.451 --> 11:45.539
Hey, Skeech, if you go ahead
and change the channels,

11:45.622 --> 11:48.917
l swear l'll suture
your hands together.

11:49.001 --> 11:52.296
- Right. So with Will...
- This woman is just fantastic.

11:52.379 --> 11:57.176
The breasts are probably fake
but by God, those tears are real.

11:57.259 --> 11:59.803
<i>Time for a bold move.</i>

12:05.225 --> 12:07.769
How are we gonna fix this Will thing?

12:07.853 --> 12:10.856
Do you know what you've just done?

12:10.939 --> 12:13.400
You just lost all lapdog privileges.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.737
- Excuse me?
- No more walkies, no more treats,

12:16.820 --> 12:19.072
no more following me around.

12:19.156 --> 12:21.742
- l'm not your lapdog.
- You back there.

12:21.825 --> 12:25.162
What do we do with lapdogs
who can't behave in the house?

12:25.245 --> 12:27.331
Make them stay outside?

12:27.414 --> 12:30.083
You have five seconds
to get out of this room,

12:30.167 --> 12:33.587
or l'm gonna start whacking you
on the nose with this.

12:33.670 --> 12:36.298
Don't laugh, this isn't a joke. Get out.

12:36.381 --> 12:38.884
- But l was thinking...
- Go!

12:43.305 --> 12:45.516
What do you want to watch?

12:45.599 --> 12:48.435
<i>- Days of our Lives?
- Attaboy.</i>

12:50.771 --> 12:52.856
Come in.

12:55.859 --> 12:57.945
He smells the food.

12:59.363 --> 13:01.448
Move your butt.

13:02.032 --> 13:04.284
Peace offering?

13:05.452 --> 13:09.832
l know l don't always
make the best first impression.

13:09.915 --> 13:12.042
Or second, for that matter.

13:12.918 --> 13:17.589
l'd like us to be friends. l thought
l could get to know you a bit better.

13:17.673 --> 13:20.092
See what you're about.

13:21.385 --> 13:24.555
For instance,
when did you meet Morgan Freeman?

13:24.638 --> 13:26.932
That's my mom.

13:28.225 --> 13:30.561
l like her freckles.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.649
Rowdy, no!

13:37.192 --> 13:40.362
l can't figure out why
Dr Cox tore me a new one today.

13:40.445 --> 13:43.115
Enough already! He's a jerk.

13:43.198 --> 13:45.826
- He's a jerk.
- He's a jerk.

13:45.909 --> 13:48.537
- He's a jerk.
- You're a jerk.

13:48.620 --> 13:51.790
He's just Dr Cox.
He's always like that.

13:51.874 --> 13:54.710
Who really knows him?
Who does he hang out with?

13:54.793 --> 13:57.379
<i>- No one.
- That must be lonely.</i>

13:57.462 --> 14:01.216
''Take two Turks as needed,
apply to sensitive areas...''

14:01.300 --> 14:03.385
Who wrote this?

14:03.468 --> 14:04.720
Whassup?

14:08.390 --> 14:13.103
Come on, Carla. Give me one good reason
why you won't go out with me.

14:13.187 --> 14:16.398
You're a surgeon,
so you got the God complex,

14:16.481 --> 14:18.775
the ''married to the job'' thing.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.236
You're cute,
but you're very aware of it.

14:21.320 --> 14:25.657
You've no idea what l'm like, so your
feelings for me come from down there.

14:25.741 --> 14:28.869
But most of all,
l'm looking for the real thing.

14:28.952 --> 14:33.415
You're nothing but a little boy
who's not used to being told ''No''.

14:33.499 --> 14:37.669
So there's a bunch of reasons.
Pick your favourite.

14:37.753 --> 14:40.547
l'd go with the God complex.

14:40.631 --> 14:43.717
But it's hard to choose.
They're all so good.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.094
<i>A hospital is a tricky place.</i>

14:46.178 --> 14:49.181
<i>It's very cliquey
and you have to watch what you say.</i>

14:49.264 --> 14:51.225
<i>It's a lot like high school.</i>

15:15.040 --> 15:17.251
<i>If I didn't have
somewhere else to be,</i>

15:17.334 --> 15:19.753
<i>I would have gone
and sat with her.</i>

15:21.839 --> 15:25.843
<i>But tonight, there's somebody
else I have to take care of.</i>

15:31.807 --> 15:34.893
l know watching Will
kill himself hurts you, too.

15:34.977 --> 15:37.479
lt's harder if you have
no one to talk with.

15:37.563 --> 15:41.441
So l figured l'd pick up
a few cold ones, right?

15:41.525 --> 15:45.612
And you and l, we'll talk it out,
we'll just break the whole thing down.

15:45.696 --> 15:48.574
Right? What do you say to that?

15:51.952 --> 15:56.165
Everyone keeps ignoring me.
l'm like a plague around here.

15:56.248 --> 15:58.458
Don't look at me
when you're talking.

15:58.542 --> 16:03.213
Dr Reid. l just wanted to say,
you're out of my doghouse.

16:03.297 --> 16:07.050
That was a great catch
on that patient with meningococcus.

16:07.134 --> 16:10.888
That actually wasn't me.
Carla noticed the rash on his legs.

16:10.971 --> 16:14.516
You could have been
back into my good graces

16:14.600 --> 16:17.519
and instead you passed
the credit on to a nurse.

16:17.603 --> 16:22.566
How noble. l tell you what,
l'll get the cafeteria staff to write

16:22.649 --> 16:25.277
''Was it worth it?''
on a big cake for you.

16:27.279 --> 16:31.116
''...station''.
This is the nurses' station.

16:34.244 --> 16:39.041
- Do you think l've damaged ligaments?
- l don't care.

16:39.124 --> 16:43.212
Now, can l count on you
to never drop by here again?

16:43.295 --> 16:45.380
Or shall l just move?

16:45.464 --> 16:48.967
You can't leave a place
with this much warmth.

16:49.051 --> 16:53.722
l especially love this shelf filled with
photos of your friends and family.

16:54.723 --> 16:58.352
<i>If he comes at you,
just try and roll out the door.</i>

16:58.435 --> 17:01.522
Actually, you have a point.

17:02.356 --> 17:06.026
l guess watching the game
by yourself with a Scotch

17:06.108 --> 17:09.780
isn't really the only way
to watch a game.

17:10.446 --> 17:17.162
lt's just that... l've always thought
of needing people as a sign of weakness.

17:17.246 --> 17:20.082
- lt's not.
- Well, then...

17:20.165 --> 17:23.544
Would you stay and
watch the game with me?

17:23.627 --> 17:25.963
Maybe have a slice of pizza?

17:27.464 --> 17:30.259
- Of course l will.
- l can braid your hair.

17:31.927 --> 17:36.056
l know the couch isn't very deep,
but we could move the back cushion

17:36.139 --> 17:38.225
and spoon.

17:39.560 --> 17:43.146
Hey, you guys, what do you say?
Beer and chips in the back.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.399
Just ignore them.

17:45.482 --> 17:47.776
Tell me the answer to this question.

17:47.860 --> 17:51.405
Do you want to be the big spoon
or the little spoon?

17:52.865 --> 17:55.742
Kelso didn't ask her,
she gave you full credit.

17:55.826 --> 18:00.664
l don't care. Too little too late.
Plus, l know why you're really here.

18:00.747 --> 18:04.459
So l'm gonna plop myself
right here in the VlP section,

18:04.543 --> 18:07.588
so you can give me what you got.

18:07.671 --> 18:10.966
l was gonna tell you
how l busted JD's chops the other day

18:11.049 --> 18:13.302
for wanting to be friends with a girl.

18:13.385 --> 18:16.680
And now l find it so amazing
to see how strong you are,

18:16.763 --> 18:18.849
how well you carry yourself,

18:18.932 --> 18:23.353
how l'd give anything to wake up
and watch you read the paper.

18:23.437 --> 18:26.523
But instead l think you should
hop off your broom,

18:26.607 --> 18:29.818
remember what it was like
when you first started here

18:29.902 --> 18:35.866
and give Elliot a break. Because she may
be a chore but she is a good person.

18:38.118 --> 18:41.497
And your ass is especially fine today.

18:41.580 --> 18:44.666
Pick me up tomorrow at seven.

18:44.750 --> 18:49.087
She's not the only one
who can do a speech. l can do a speech.

18:49.171 --> 18:53.967
Return that umbrella to me at
the hospital. Not here. ls that clear?

18:55.260 --> 18:57.513
And, Newbie...

18:57.596 --> 19:00.349
- Know what your problem is?
- My bones hurt?

19:00.432 --> 19:05.062
You were gonna rescue me from loneliness
with a $3 six-pack of light beer?

19:06.271 --> 19:09.650
lt turns out we can't
save people from themselves.

19:09.733 --> 19:13.529
We just treat 'em. Treat that kid
with a respiratory problem

19:13.612 --> 19:17.074
and when he comes back with cancer,
go ahead and treat that.

19:17.157 --> 19:20.786
Thanks for the pick-me-up.

19:20.869 --> 19:24.540
Smokers, drinkers, druggies,
fatties, whatever.

19:24.623 --> 19:30.254
lf you keep living and dying on whether
or not a person changes, well...

19:32.089 --> 19:34.591
You're not gonna make it as a doctor.

19:38.303 --> 19:41.890
Now come here and give me a hug.
lt's OK, come here.

19:44.393 --> 19:45.727
Get outta here!

19:45.811 --> 19:48.939
Take this piss water with you.
lt's embarrassing.

19:49.022 --> 19:53.819
- l'll drink it!
- l'll take the beer. You'll beat it.

19:53.902 --> 19:56.113
- You apologise.
- No, l don't wanna.

19:56.196 --> 20:00.909
OK, come on. Just do it really fast.
Like a Band-Aid.

20:00.993 --> 20:05.122
l wrote out the pharmacy renewals
on all your patients.

20:05.205 --> 20:09.042
Great. You know what else
would be helpful?

20:10.878 --> 20:14.173
<i>The one thing we never
stop looking for is acceptance.</i>

20:14.256 --> 20:16.592
- Thank you, Carla.
- You're welcome.

20:16.675 --> 20:19.136
<i>Acceptance of our own shortcomings.</i>

20:19.219 --> 20:22.347
- So when's the baby due?
- What baby?

20:22.431 --> 20:26.143
<i>Acceptance that some things
are gonna be what they're gonna be.</i>

20:26.226 --> 20:29.855
This is a strange resort.
The wheelchair service is great

20:29.938 --> 20:33.192
but that suite l rented,
there was another person in it.

20:33.275 --> 20:37.279
- And the bellhop gave me an enema.
- Yeah, he's new here.

20:40.782 --> 20:42.576
So...

20:42.659 --> 20:46.830
- Anything you wanna say?
- You know it all, man.

20:48.123 --> 20:50.209
<i>Still, I hated Will a little</i>

20:50.292 --> 20:53.086
<i>cos I looked at people
who are important to me</i>

20:53.170 --> 20:55.464
<i>in terms of what
will probably kill them.</i>

20:55.547 --> 20:57.674
<i>Heart disease.</i>

20:57.758 --> 20:59.968
<i>Liver disease.</i>

21:00.052 --> 21:02.346
<i>Somebody choking her.</i>

21:03.931 --> 21:06.141
<i>I don't know.</i>

21:06.225 --> 21:08.310
<i>Probably stress.</i>

21:13.440 --> 21:15.901
- Say anything else to him?
- No.

21:15.984 --> 21:18.070
But you wanted to.

21:18.153 --> 21:21.073
- You told me not to.
- Would you be a man?

21:21.156 --> 21:24.993
Stick to your convictions
or you'll never make it as a doctor.

21:30.332 --> 21:32.584
l can't believe your head exploded.

21:32.668 --> 21:35.420
lf it does,
you'll never make it as a doctor.

21:35.504 --> 21:37.923
l mean, come on.
You look ridiculous.
