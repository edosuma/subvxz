Hey, your school elections are coming up.

Why don't you run for class president?

Well, uh... please let her know
that she's welcome to come in anytime.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.896
I would, but I'm not allowed
to use your name in the house.

she's almost ready to talk about it.

Maybe that means
she finally found a parking spot.

You know, I've written at least
a dozen e-mails,

So, what'd you think
of my unboxing video?

Is it me, or did I reach down deep
and find a little something extra?

05:36.086 --> 05:40.841
I usually find the genre to be banal,
but with you, it's oddly tolerable.

05:42.884 --> 05:46.346
Oh, you know, I was thinking.
