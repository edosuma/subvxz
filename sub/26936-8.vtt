-But if you could
do it digitally,</font>

-you can 3-D model it, perhaps.
-DOUG: Yeah.</font>

09:12.789 --> 09:15.379

19:37.420 --> 19:40.210

Oh, my. Wow.</font>

20:26.750 --> 20:29.500
LAIRD: So, you can see,
by the large rock there,</font>

20:29.500 --> 20:31.380
where Gary was getting ceramics.</font>

20:31.380 --> 20:33.579

Piece of pottery.</font>

20:49.420 --> 20:50.829
ALEX:
Yeah, it looks like it.</font>

20:50.829 --> 20:53.250
NARRATOR:
<i> It was also at this site</i> </font>

20:53.250 --> 20:55.619

 of what could be</i> </font>

20:55.619 --> 20:58.079
<i> a man-made structure.</i> </font>

20:58.079 --> 21:01.289
Could be a shaft or a tunnel
that was filled in.</font>

21:01.289 --> 21:03.539
RICK: We're always looking
for clues about underground work</font>

21:15.119 --> 21:18.920
<i>Rick, Marty and Laird will work
 to unearth what could be</i> </font>

21:18.920 --> 21:22.329
<i> an important
 archaeological location.</i> </font>

21:22.329 --> 21:24.380
So how do you intend
to proceed here, Laird?</font>

21:24.380 --> 21:27.500
-Usually what we do
is establish a baseline.
-Okay.</font>

21:27.500 --> 21:30.539
It really often depends
on what you're dealing with,</font>

21:30.539 --> 21:34.420
so I think the plan is to,
perhaps, concentrate in here.</font>

21:34.420 --> 21:36.329
RICK:
Okay, you guys set up the grid.</font>

21:36.329 --> 21:39.170
I've got to go make some
phone calls. Give me a call.</font>

21:39.170 --> 21:41.460
NARRATOR: <i> In order to accurately
 track the exact spot</i> </font>

21:41.460 --> 21:45.119
<i> where any important artifacts
 are uncovered,</i> </font>

21:45.119 --> 21:47.289
<i> Marty and Laird will use
 a grid system</i> </font>

21:47.289 --> 21:49.750
<i> to divide the area

21:49.750 --> 21:52.880

 two feet by 20 feet.</i> </font>

21:52.880 --> 21:57.250
MARTY: <i> We're just not sure at
 this point what this thing is.</i> </font>

21:57.250 --> 21:58.960
<i> But it's very interesting
 to watch</i> </font>

21:58.960 --> 22:01.420
<i> how Laird proceeds
 and how he does things.</i> </font>

22:01.420 --> 22:03.289
I find that fascinating, really.</font>

22:05.250 --> 22:07.170
LAIRD:
We're in the honey hole now.</font>

22:20.210 --> 22:22.619
-MARTY: What do you got there?
-LAIRD: Base of a pot.</font>

22:22.619 --> 22:24.170
MARTY:
Well, how about that?</font>

22:24.170 --> 22:25.579
LAIRD: You'd expect
to find that in a house.</font>

22:25.579 --> 22:27.380
-Mm-hmm. Age?
-(chuckles)</font>

22:27.380 --> 22:28.619
Impossible, right?</font>

22:28.619 --> 22:30.880
Yeah.</font>

22:30.880 --> 22:32.920
MARTY: Well, this archeological
stuff is more fun</font>

22:32.920 --> 22:34.710
when you keep fishing stuff
out of there.</font>

22:34.710 --> 22:36.079
Yep.</font>

22:41.000 --> 22:42.920
MARTY:
Really? The old</font>

22:42.920 --> 22:45.250
"who was the last person to
touch this" is kind of cool.</font>

22:45.250 --> 22:46.579
Any idea how old, Laird?</font>

22:46.579 --> 22:51.119
Well, sa uh, 1750 to 1840.</font>

22:51.119 --> 22:53.670
-Oh, not before that?
-No, not that one.</font>

22:53.670 --> 22:55.960
I think that we're looking
at something that has to do</font>

22:55.960 --> 22:58.880
with Mr. Samuel Ball;
that's what I think.</font>

22:58.880 --> 23:03.210
NARRATOR: <i> At the start of the
 American Revolution in 1776,</i> </font>

23:03.210 --> 23:06.329
<i> Samuel Ball was
 an 11-year old slave</i> </font>

23:06.329 --> 23:08.960
<i> who had escaped from
 a South Carolina plantation.</i> </font>

23:08.960 --> 23:11.789
<i> After winning his freedom</i> </font>

23:11.789 --> 23:13.920
<i> by fighting on the side
 of the British,</i> </font>

23:13.920 --> 23:18.750
<i> in 1786,
 he moved to Nova Scotia,</i> </font>

23:18.750 --> 23:21.539
<i> where he purchased one of
 Oak Island's four-acre lots</i> </font>

23:21.539 --> 23:25.170
<i> and began a new life
 as a cabbage farmer.</i> </font>

23:25.170 --> 23:29.250
<i> But by the time
 of his death in 1846,</i> </font>

23:29.250 --> 23:31.920
<i> Samuel Ball was revealed</i> </font>

23:31.920 --> 23:35.000
<i>to be one of the wealthiest men
 in Nova Scotia.</i> </font>

23:35.000 --> 23:38.960
<i> In addition to owning a total
 of 36 acres on the island--</i> </font>

23:38.960 --> 23:41.500
<i> including Lot 24--</i> </font>

23:41.500 --> 23:44.579
<i> he also owned several more
 acres on the mainland.</i> </font>

23:44.579 --> 23:47.329
<i> It was this change of fortune</i> </font>

23:47.329 --> 23:50.380
<i> that suggested to many
 that Samuel Ball</i> </font>

23:50.380 --> 23:54.119
<i> might have found a portion
 of the Oak Island treasure.</i> </font>

23:54.119 --> 23:56.000
MARTY:
Have we uncovered anything</font>

23:56.000 --> 23:57.619
that makes you think
what this is?</font>

23:57.619 --> 24:01.210
LAIRD: The larger stones
could be structural.</font>

24:01.210 --> 24:04.329
It still has potential
as a cellar.</font>

24:04.329 --> 24:06.250
MARTY: This is previously
unknown, isn't it?</font>

24:06.250 --> 24:08.880
-Yep.
-Wow.</font>

24:08.880 --> 24:10.500
NARRATOR:
<i> Is it possible that this was</i> </font>

24:10.500 --> 24:12.750
<i> a cellar built by Samuel Ball?</i> </font>

24:12.750 --> 24:16.210
<i> If so, what was it used for?</i> </font>

24:16.210 --> 24:17.920
<i> And could something of value</i> </font>

24:17.920 --> 24:20.579
<i> still be hidden
 somewhere inside?</i> </font>

24:20.579 --> 24:22.210
Well, there's only one way
to find out.</font>

28:48.670 --> 28:51.829
NARRATOR: <i> During the late 17th
 and early 18th centuries,</i> </font>

28:51.829 --> 28:55.039
<i> when coins in England
 contained precious metals,</i> </font>

28:55.039 --> 28:58.420
<i> such as gold and silver,
 the Royal Mint faced</i> </font>

28:58.420 --> 29:01.329
<i> a nationwide problem
 of coin clipping.</i> </font>

29:01.329 --> 29:03.119
<i> This was a practice</i> </font>

29:03.119 --> 29:05.289
<i> whereby metal would be
 cut off the edges,</i> </font>

29:05.289 --> 29:07.500
<i> so that the owner could
 save the shavings</i> </font>

29:07.500 --> 29:10.079
<i> and trade the coin
 for more than its worth.</i> </font>

29:10.079 --> 29:13.500
<i> Eventually, the clipped coins
 became so damaged</i> </font>

29:13.500 --> 29:16.250
<i> that they were
 virtually unrecognizable,</i> </font>

29:16.250 --> 29:19.039
<i> which, in turn,
 encouraged counterfeiting.</i> </font>

29:19.039 --> 29:21.500
<i> In order to combat
 this practice,</i> </font>

29:21.500 --> 29:24.500

 the famed scholar, physicist,</i> </font>

29:24.500 --> 29:26.829
<i> and Master of the Royal Mint,</i> </font>

29:26.829 --> 29:29.579
<i> designed coins with
 ridged or milled edges,</i> </font>

29:29.579 --> 29:33.920
<i> giving them identifiable marks
 that, if shaved off,</i> </font>

29:33.920 --> 29:37.289
<i> would make the altered coins
 virtually worthless.</i> </font>

29:37.289 --> 29:42.619
<i> If the gold-colored object is,
 in fact, a coin,</i> </font>

29:42.619 --> 29:45.539
<i> the absence of milled edges
 is a likely indication</i> </font>

29:45.539 --> 29:48.039
<i>that it pre-dates the discovery</i> </font>

29:48.039 --> 29:50.880
<i> of the original Money Pit
 in 1795.</i> </font>

29:50.880 --> 29:52.960
It's not copper, either.</font>

gold-plated.</font>

GARY:
Yeah. Yeah, I can see sparkles.</font>

29:57.789 --> 30:00.460

31:00.329 --> 31:02.789
-Gold wouldn't be encrusted,
would it?
-No.</font>

31:02.789 --> 31:05.329
Um, not high-grade gold,
but low-grade gold would be.</font>

31:07.500 --> 31:09.460
Can you stand it on edge?</font>

31:09.460 --> 31:12.460
I can tip it up a little bit.</font>

31:12.460 --> 31:16.579

PAUL:
See if I can get focus on that.</font>

31:18.960 --> 31:21.380
GARY: Oh, look at that; that
looks gold around the edges.</font>

31:21.380 --> 31:22.539
PAUL:
It's starting to look like gold.</font>

31:25.579 --> 31:28.380
NARRATOR: <i> Could this coin,

-Look.</font>

31:38.329 --> 31:42.039
NARRATOR: <i> Two months ago,

31:54.039 --> 31:56.670
Mm, it doesn't look serrated.</font>

31:56.670 --> 32:01.380

an old coin, early 1700s.</font>

32:01.380 --> 32:03.329
-MARTY: It needs cleaning.
-GARY: Yeah.</font>

32:03.329 --> 32:06.119
It's actually quite beautiful;
just look at that.</font>

32:06.119 --> 32:10.170
The blues, the yellows,
little crystals.</font>

32:10.170 --> 32:12.420
GARY: And it's probably got
a lot of embossing on it.</font>

32:12.420 --> 32:14.420
The more intricate design on it,</font>

32:14.420 --> 32:18.250
the more likely particles
are gonna attach to it</font>

32:18.250 --> 32:21.880

become even more encrusted.</font>

32:21.880 --> 32:24.829

34:04.880 --> 34:07.500
One way to find out.</font>

39:00.829 --> 39:04.750
Not seeing any Roman numerals
offhand, though.</font>

39:04.750 --> 39:06.710
Billy?</font>

39:06.710 --> 39:10.039
Can you take a bucket of water
and dump it on that?</font>

39:10.039 --> 39:11.210
Yep.</font>

39:20.380 --> 39:23.500
-JACK: Oh, that worked.
-That's good!</font>

39:23.500 --> 39:25.380
Billy.</font>

39:25.380 --> 39:27.539
I'm gonna go down.</font>

39:36.789 --> 39:39.539
MARTY: You find any
Roman numerals on that, Craig?</font>

39:39.539 --> 39:41.420
CRAIG: No, but we haven't
really looked.</font>

39:41.420 --> 39:43.210
In fact,
I'll get that red bucket.</font>

39:43.210 --> 39:45.380
-This might be...
-Here you go, my friend.</font>

39:45.380 --> 39:48.170
-Do the honors.
-Yeah. I think I see it.</font>

39:51.539 --> 39:52.960
-TERRY: Another number?
-Yep.</font>

39:56.380 --> 39:57.710
TERRY:
Holy (bleep).</font>

39:59.500 --> 40:01.460
CRAIG:
Yep, three.</font>

40:01.460 --> 40:02.789
JACK:
You found a three?</font>

40:02.789 --> 40:05.079
-CRAIG: Yes. Yep.
-TERRY: Wow!</font>

40:05.079 --> 40:06.750
MARTY:
Let's see if the famous four</font>

40:06.750 --> 40:08.329
is cut in with four,
you know what I mean?</font>

40:14.960 --> 40:16.710
Yeah, there's the four,
"IV," right there.</font>

40:18.829 --> 40:20.579
TERRY: Wow, that's definitely
chiseled in, eh?</font>

40:20.579 --> 40:22.670
RICK:
Amazing.</font>

40:22.670 --> 40:24.539
This is awesome.</font>

40:24.539 --> 40:26.460
(laughs)</font>

40:26.460 --> 40:27.670
MARTY:
Very impressive.</font>

40:27.670 --> 40:30.119
Is this searcher or depositor?</font>

40:30.119 --> 40:32.329
Trying to figure it out.</font>

40:32.329 --> 40:35.119
I think we should dig that out.
Dan never did.</font>

40:36.829 --> 40:38.579
Who knows what's in there?</font>

40:38.579 --> 40:40.119
That's where your drains
are gonna be, inside that.</font>

40:40.119 --> 40:42.710
Maybe.</font>

40:42.710 --> 40:45.500
RICK: Quite a structure,
but what was it?</font>

40:47.710 --> 40:49.329
<i>Okay, well, let's get after it.</i> </font>

40:49.329 --> 40:51.420
<i> Back to the search.</i> </font>

40:51.420 --> 40:55.829
NARRATOR:
<i>For Rick, Marty and their team,</i> </font>

40:55.829 --> 41:00.250
<i> the discovery of what could be
 an ancient structure buried</i> </font>

41:00.250 --> 41:04.539
<i> deep below Smith's Cove offers
 an important breakthrough.</i> </font>

41:04.539 --> 41:10.039
<i>If it can be determined to have
 been built prior to 1795,</i> </font>

41:10.039 --> 41:15.119
<i> it may serve as an important
 piece in an enormous puzzle</i> </font>

41:15.119 --> 41:19.289
<i> that could lead to
 a centuries-old treasure,</i> </font>

41:19.289 --> 41:22.579
<i> one with a curse
 that has claimed the lives</i> </font>

41:22.579 --> 41:24.960
<i> of six men so far,</i> </font>

41:24.960 --> 41:29.250
<i> and awaits a sacrifice
 of still one more</i> </font>

41:29.250 --> 41:32.960
<i> before its secrets
 will be revealed.</i> </font>

41:35.250 --> 41:38.119
<i> Next time on
</i> The Curse of Oak Island...</font>

41:38.119 --> 41:40.170
GARY:
<i> We're heading to Apple Island.</i> </font>

41:40.170 --> 41:42.000
-JACK: Do you see what I see?
-TONY: Oh, my God.</font>

41:42.000 --> 41:44.710
-We're dead on.
-The star map theory
could be correct.</font>

41:44.710 --> 41:46.960
Hold the phone, boys!
The plot thickens.</font>

41:46.960 --> 41:49.289
MARTY: <i> The Money Pit
 collapsed in 1861,</i> </font>

41:49.289 --> 41:51.079
<i> and we're in the debris field.</i> </font>

41:51.079 --> 41:53.039
ROBERT: This stone was used
as something in the past,</font>

41:53.039 --> 41:54.920
and it has caused certain areas
to wear off completely.</font>

41:54.920 --> 41:56.829
Those are letters inscribed
into the stone.</font>

41:56.829 --> 41:59.250
Without a doubt,
this is the stone.</font>

41:59.250 --> 42:00.960
-TERRY: Whoa!
-LAIRD: This definitely
isn't on any map.</font>

42:00.960 --> 42:03.670
This is
an undiscovered structure.</font>
