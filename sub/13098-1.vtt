You're relieved.

00:18.875 --> 00:20.833
Wait. Picking up disturbance.

'Fire, fire!'

Tell them we're under attack.
Tell them it's the..

00:51.375 --> 00:52.875
Garibaldi, have you seen
the commander?

00:52.958 --> 00:54.792
I've tried linking in.
He's not responding.

00:55.958 --> 00:57.583
In that case,
he's in the Observation Dome.

00:57.667 --> 01:00.250
- How do you know?
- Oh, right. You're new here.

01:00.333 --> 01:02.125
He only turns off his link
for 10 minutes a day.

01:02.208 --> 01:04.417
And when he does,
that's where you can find him.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.167
But why? There's no traffic
due in for a while.

01:06.250 --> 01:08.083
The Dome's on standby.
No one's there.

01:08.167 --> 01:09.542
Exactly.

01:09.625 --> 01:11.000
Uh, Mr. Garibaldi?

01:13.458 --> 01:14.667
Oh, boy.

01:20.917 --> 01:22.375
Commander..

01:22.458 --> 01:23.625
'...there's a problem.'

01:25.375 --> 01:27.375
All I'm asking
is that you trust me.

01:27.458 --> 01:28.625
Trust you?

01:28.708 --> 01:30.833
Londo, my brain will be
five days dead

01:30.917 --> 01:32.458
before I ever trust a Centauri.

01:32.542 --> 01:33.917
The first time we met you people

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
the first time we met
any other civilization

01:36.083 --> 01:38.667
you told us you practically
ran the entire galaxy.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.000
What was it you said?

01:40.083 --> 01:41.375
"A huge empire."

01:41.458 --> 01:43.042
Come on. Public relations.

01:43.125 --> 01:45.500
Only that hasn't been true
for almost a 100 years.

01:45.583 --> 01:46.708
Then you give us this line

01:46.792 --> 01:49.167
about how Earth is some lost
Centauri tribe

01:49.250 --> 01:50.875
making us distant relatives.

01:50.958 --> 01:52.500
Until we finally got our hands

01:52.583 --> 01:53.833
on some Centauri DNA

01:53.917 --> 01:55.833
and find out we're
not related at all.

01:55.917 --> 01:57.333

01:57.417 --> 01:58.750

01:58.833 --> 01:59.917
(Londo)
'A clerical error.'

02:00.000 --> 02:01.583
- A clerical error?
- Yes.

02:01.667 --> 02:03.500
We thought your world
was Beta-Nine.

02:03.583 --> 02:05.000
It was actually Beta-12.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.917
Okay, we made a mistake.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.792
I'm sorry.
Here, open my wrists.

02:09.875 --> 02:12.833
Centauri don't have major
arteries in their wrists.

02:12.917 --> 02:15.333
Of course, we don't.
What do you think? I'm stupid?

02:15.417 --> 02:18.708
Do you know what your problem
is, Mr. Garibaldi?

02:18.792 --> 02:20.375
You're not a people person.

02:20.458 --> 02:22.000
Oh, Ambassador! Ambassador!

02:22.083 --> 02:25.042
Uh, Mr. Garibaldi, have you met
my diplomatic staff?

02:25.125 --> 02:27.542
Just arrived from the Homeworld.

02:27.625 --> 02:29.375
This is it.

02:29.458 --> 02:31.875
- 'Ambassador?'
- Yes, Vir, what is it?

02:31.958 --> 02:33.875
Our colony, Ragesh III

02:33.958 --> 02:35.333
our agricultural colony?

02:35.417 --> 02:37.667
Yes, I know what it is.
What about it?

02:37.750 --> 02:39.042
It's under attack.

02:39.125 --> 02:41.292
No provocation, no warning.

02:41.375 --> 02:42.708
'They-they got
to the minefields'

02:42.792 --> 02:44.792
and now they're firing
on anything that moves.

02:44.875 --> 02:47.250

Wave after wave after wave.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.375
- Who launched the attack?
- I don't know.

No one does.

It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind.

03:05.708 --> 03:08.917
Ten years after
the Earth-Minbari War.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.333
The Babylon Project

03:10.417 --> 03:12.375
was a dream given form.

03:12.458 --> 03:14.458
Its goal, to prevent
another war

03:14.542 --> 03:16.792
by creating a place
where humans and aliens

03:16.875 --> 03:19.625
could work out
their differences peacefully.

03:19.708 --> 03:21.375
It's a port of call

03:21.458 --> 03:22.667
home away from home

03:22.750 --> 03:24.750
for diplomats, hustlers

03:24.833 --> 03:27.917
entrepreneurs and wanderers.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.625
Humans and aliens wrapped

03:29.708 --> 03:32.292
in 2,500,000 tons

03:32.375 --> 03:34.333
of spinning metal..

03:34.417 --> 03:36.125
...all alone in the night.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.750
It can be a dangerous place.

03:39.833 --> 03:41.833
But it's our last, best hope

03:41.917 --> 03:43.042
for peace.

03:43.125 --> 03:44.833
This is the story of the last

03:44.917 --> 03:46.958
of the Babylon stations.

03:47.042 --> 03:49.458
The year is 2258.

03:49.542 --> 03:50.833
The name of the place

03:50.917 --> 03:53.042
is Babylon 5.

04:38.167 --> 04:39.667

04:39.750 --> 04:41.208
I demand to know

04:41.292 --> 04:43.417
what information your government

04:43.500 --> 04:45.667
has concerning Ragesh III?

04:45.750 --> 04:47.250
We don't know anything more
than you do.

04:47.333 --> 04:49.667
We know it's been attacked,
but that's all.

04:49.750 --> 04:51.333
What have you heard
from Centauri Prime?

04:51.417 --> 04:53.958
Nothing. I sent three messages.

04:54.042 --> 04:55.500
No answer.

04:55.583 --> 04:57.083
No one is talking.

04:57.167 --> 04:59.167
Ambassador, I just heard.

04:59.250 --> 05:02.208
Yes. You have my sincerest
condolences for your losses.

05:02.292 --> 05:04.708
You know nothing
about this attack, G'Kar?

05:04.792 --> 05:07.375
I'm as astonished as you are.

05:07.458 --> 05:09.208
Can you tell us something
about the colony?

05:09.292 --> 05:10.708
There's nothing to tell.

05:10.792 --> 05:12.417
It's an agricultural base.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.792
Strictly a civilian operation.

05:14.875 --> 05:16.208
5000 colonists

05:16.292 --> 05:17.500
they're practically unarmed.

05:17.583 --> 05:18.917
I suggest we contact
our governments

05:19.000 --> 05:20.167
and see what they know.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.625
Then, we'll call
an emergency session

05:21.708 --> 05:22.708
with the Council and the League

05:22.792 --> 05:23.833
of Non-Aligned Worlds.

05:23.917 --> 05:25.625
We'll do whatever we can
to help you.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.250
Just got your message.
What's up?

05:33.333 --> 05:35.250
I'm picking up
a long-range distress signal.

05:35.333 --> 05:36.833
from a ship near
the secondary jump point.

05:36.917 --> 05:38.208
'I mean, first I was afraid
it had something'

05:38.292 --> 05:40.000
to do with the attack
on Ragesh III

05:40.083 --> 05:42.083
but it's an Earth-registered
ship.

05:42.167 --> 05:44.583
And the last distress signal
mentioned Raiders.

05:44.667 --> 05:46.792
I knew they'd be back
sooner or later.

05:46.875 --> 05:48.583
Okay, I'll grab a fighter,
check it out. Tell--

05:48.667 --> 05:50.000

to stand by for launch.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.208
I want those ships
prepped and ready to go.

06:09.458 --> 06:11.458
Psi Corp regulations
require me to log in

06:11.542 --> 06:12.583
'with the second in command.'

06:12.667 --> 06:14.500
I've tried to reach you
three times

06:14.583 --> 06:15.917
but I guess you've been busy.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.583
I figured I'd try
the direct approach.

06:17.667 --> 06:19.708
Your diligence is commendable.
Anything else?

06:20.917 --> 06:22.708
- No, l just--
- Then you'll excuse me.

of 15 things.

07:09.375 --> 07:10.625

Thought I'd see if
there is any word yet

07:12.125 --> 07:14.208
from Earth Central
on the Centauri problem?

07:15.542 --> 07:17.125
'No..'

07:17.208 --> 07:18.667
...and that worries me.

07:18.750 --> 07:20.667
They've had plenty of time
to digest the report

07:20.750 --> 07:22.333
but so far, nothing.

07:22.417 --> 07:24.333
Who do you think
attacked the colony?

07:24.417 --> 07:26.292
The Narns? The Minbari?

07:26.375 --> 07:28.458
Not the Minbari.
It's not their way.

07:28.542 --> 07:31.583
They're too honorable
to pull something like this.

07:31.667 --> 07:34.875
I'm surprised to hear you
describe the Minbari that way.

07:34.958 --> 07:36.875
After all, you fought them
during the war.

07:36.958 --> 07:39.542
Well, my father always told me..

07:39.625 --> 07:42.250
...the best way to understand
someone is to fight him.

07:42.333 --> 07:43.708
Make him angry.

07:43.792 --> 07:45.542
That's when you see
the real person.

07:46.875 --> 07:48.292
Was he also a pilot?

07:49.833 --> 07:50.917
The best.

have been fighter pilots

I've never seen
the Minbari fight dishonorably.

08:11.958 --> 08:13.667
They'd never pull
a sneak attack.

08:14.625 --> 08:15.667
Perhaps.

08:16.958 --> 08:18.500
Any word yet on the election?

08:20.583 --> 08:22.000
It's gonna be close.

So, who are you voting for?

08:24.708 --> 08:26.375
I think I'll vote
for Marie Crane.

08:32.042 --> 08:34.083
I do not like Santiago.

08:34.167 --> 08:36.917
I've always thought a leader
should have a strong chin.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.125
He has no chin

08:38.208 --> 08:40.458
and his vice president
has several.

a good combination.

10:36.333 --> 10:38.792
We'll strike back
and we'll strike back hard.

10:38.875 --> 10:40.833
I assume you're referring
to the attack

10:40.917 --> 10:42.708
on Ragesh III by our forces.

10:42.792 --> 10:44.417
I just found out
about it myself.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.542
I'm sure there's
a reasonable explanation.

10:46.625 --> 10:48.667
What reasonable
explanation is there

10:48.750 --> 10:51.125
for the slaughter
of unarmed civilians?

10:51.208 --> 10:52.750
Curious, we wondered
the same thing

10:52.833 --> 10:54.083
when you invaded our world.

10:54.167 --> 10:56.458
The wheel turns, does it not,
Ambassador?

10:56.542 --> 10:57.625
Fine!

10:57.708 --> 10:58.750
We should have wiped out
your kind

10:58.833 --> 11:00.250
when we had the chance.

11:00.333 --> 11:03.083
What happened? Run out of
small children to butcher?

11:03.167 --> 11:05.125
You pig. Animal!

11:05.208 --> 11:08.292
[grunting]

11:10.708 --> 11:12.083
Let him go!

11:12.167 --> 11:13.833
If he wants to die, let him.

11:13.917 --> 11:15.542
Listen to me, Ambassador.

11:15.625 --> 11:17.333
Your time has come and gone!

11:17.417 --> 11:19.042
It's our turn now!

11:19.125 --> 11:20.792
One night you'll
wake up and find

11:20.875 --> 11:22.750
our teeth at your throat.

11:22.833 --> 11:25.125
'Sleep well, ambassador.'

11:25.208 --> 11:27.250
Sleep lightly.

11:45.083 --> 11:47.250
I apologize for the, uh

11:47.333 --> 11:49.875
the incident with G'Kar,
commander.

11:50.792 --> 11:52.292
It was a mistake.

11:53.167 --> 11:54.500
I will not repeat it.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.708
I will kill him, though.

11:59.333 --> 12:00.833
Sooner or later.

12:00.917 --> 12:02.625
- Somewhere.
- Ambassador..

12:02.708 --> 12:03.708
My people..

12:03.792 --> 12:05.792
...we have a way, you see.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.042
We know how

12:09.125 --> 12:11.250
and sometimes even when

12:11.333 --> 12:13.292
we are going to die.

12:13.375 --> 12:15.042
Comes in a dream, huh.

12:17.208 --> 12:18.833
In my dream..

12:18.917 --> 12:20.000
...I am an old man.

12:20.083 --> 12:21.750
It's 20 years from now

12:21.833 --> 12:23.375
and I am dying.

12:24.250 --> 12:25.458
My hands

12:25.542 --> 12:27.458
wrapped around someone's throat

12:27.542 --> 12:29.083
and his around mine.

12:29.875 --> 12:31.708
We have squeezed

12:31.792 --> 12:34.125
the life out of each other.

12:35.083 --> 12:37.708
The first time I saw G'Kar..

12:37.792 --> 12:40.667
...I recognized him as the one
from the dream.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.833
[giggles]
It will happen.

12:42.917 --> 12:44.167
20 years from now

12:44.250 --> 12:45.708
we will die with our hands

12:45.792 --> 12:47.667
around each other's throats.

12:47.750 --> 12:49.833
Twenty years is a long time.

12:49.917 --> 12:52.250
Long enough for your people
to come to an understanding.

12:52.333 --> 12:53.667
Believe as you wish.

12:54.458 --> 12:55.625
Twenty years from now

12:55.708 --> 12:58.208
one of us will be wiser
and older.

12:59.167 --> 13:00.750
Or one of us will be dead.

13:00.833 --> 13:02.042
Who's to say?

13:03.208 --> 13:04.667
Me, I need another drink.

13:07.167 --> 13:08.292
I think we have a chance

13:08.375 --> 13:09.625
to put together a coalition

13:09.708 --> 13:11.083
against the Narn attack.

13:11.167 --> 13:12.083
Good.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.875
The Narns have to be stopped.

13:13.958 --> 13:16.625
Now, while we still can.

13:17.875 --> 13:20.125
Carn would want me to...

13:23.500 --> 13:24.542
Carn.

13:27.750 --> 13:30.208
Carn is my nephew.

13:30.292 --> 13:32.708
He wanted to enter
the Centauri military.

13:32.792 --> 13:35.708
I told him it was a waste
of his skills.

13:36.417 --> 13:37.625
The truth is..

13:38.792 --> 13:40.375
...I was afraid for him.

13:41.125 --> 13:42.417
'I wanted him..'

13:43.292 --> 13:44.542
'...someplace safe.'

13:45.333 --> 13:46.833
Away from all of this.

13:48.458 --> 13:51.333
So I personally arranged

13:51.417 --> 13:53.458
for him to have a higher
position..

13:54.375 --> 13:56.042
...as head researcher

13:56.708 --> 13:58.417
on Ragesh III.

14:02.417 --> 14:04.208
Tonight..

14:04.292 --> 14:06.417
...I don't know
if he's alive or dead.

14:07.583 --> 14:08.750
I'm sorry.

14:13.458 --> 14:14.583
Ambassador..

14:14.667 --> 14:16.042
...I know this is hard for you.

14:16.125 --> 14:17.542
But if this escalates into a war

14:17.625 --> 14:19.583
you'll give the Narns
exactly what they want.

14:19.667 --> 14:22.875
'A chance to divide us
so they can move in.'

14:22.958 --> 14:24.458
There are other ways.

14:25.583 --> 14:27.833
Babylon 5 is here
to help keep the peace.

14:29.625 --> 14:32.000
Commander, please.

14:32.083 --> 14:34.417
On the issue of
galactic peace..

14:34.500 --> 14:36.375
...I am long past innocence

14:36.458 --> 14:38.792
and fast approaching apathy.

14:38.875 --> 14:40.083
It's all a game

14:40.167 --> 14:41.458
a paper fantasy

14:41.542 --> 14:43.458
of names and borders.

14:44.458 --> 14:46.375
Only one thing matters,
commander.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.750
Blood.

14:48.833 --> 14:50.667
It calls out for blood.

14:52.042 --> 14:53.458
If Carn is dead

14:53.542 --> 14:55.042
there will be war.

14:55.125 --> 14:57.250
'Today, tomorrow,
the day after'

14:57.333 --> 14:58.958
it doesn't matter.

14:59.042 --> 15:01.625
If it's the last thing I do

15:01.708 --> 15:03.625
if it's the last breath I take..

15:04.542 --> 15:05.833
...there will be war.

15:07.542 --> 15:09.500
This, I swear to you, commander.

15:10.708 --> 15:12.417
This, I swear.

15:21.542 --> 15:23.917
You eat like a starving man.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.333
Seeing death has a way
of doing that to me.

15:26.417 --> 15:28.500
There were 15 bodies
on that ship we found.

15:28.583 --> 15:30.000
I mean, what's going on
around here?

15:30.083 --> 15:31.583
We got a war breaking
out on Ragesh III

15:31.667 --> 15:33.458
pirates are at work over here.
You ask me?

15:33.542 --> 15:35.833
The universe is going to hell
in a handbasket.

15:35.917 --> 15:37.000
'You fill in the commander yet?'

15:37.083 --> 15:38.333
The report's on his desk.

15:38.417 --> 15:39.583
'This makes it
third time in a month'

15:39.667 --> 15:41.167
'Raiders have hit a ship
in this sector.'

15:41.250 --> 15:42.500
'They're getting bolder.'

15:42.583 --> 15:43.958
(Garibaldi)
And a lot more powerful.

15:44.042 --> 15:45.542
The weapons they hit
the supply ship with are bigger

15:45.625 --> 15:47.875
than anything the Raider's
have ever used before.

15:47.958 --> 15:50.875
- Idea where they'll hit next?
- Not yet.

15:50.958 --> 15:52.375
The thing is transport routes
are kept secret

15:52.458 --> 15:54.375
so they can avoid
being attacked like this.

15:54.458 --> 15:55.625
This sounds like there's a leak.

15:56.458 --> 15:57.750
I'm checking into it now.

15:57.833 --> 15:59.583
Good. Keep me informed.

16:17.167 --> 16:18.250
Ambassador Kosh

16:18.333 --> 16:20.250
Commander Sinclair.
Can I see you?

16:43.375 --> 16:44.875
(Kosh)
'Greetings, commander.'

16:49.833 --> 16:51.583
You weren't at the Council room
earlier.

16:51.667 --> 16:52.958
I wanted to make sure you knew

16:53.042 --> 16:54.958
about the emergency session.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.750
'Yes.'

16:58.833 --> 17:01.792
We may need your help
to push through sanctions.

17:01.875 --> 17:03.375
Does your government
have a position

17:03.458 --> 17:04.958
on the current situation?

17:09.500 --> 17:11.417
Will you attend
the emergency meeting?

17:14.583 --> 17:15.667
'Yes.'

17:19.458 --> 17:21.083
[whooshing]

17:24.875 --> 17:26.292
They are alone.

17:29.625 --> 17:31.708
They are a dying people.

17:33.208 --> 17:35.417
We should let them pass.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.083
Who?

17:37.167 --> 17:38.833
The Narn or the Centauri?

17:41.833 --> 17:42.875
Yes.

17:51.083 --> 17:52.375
Mr. Garibaldi?

17:53.333 --> 17:54.458
You're sitting at my station

17:54.542 --> 17:55.958
using my equipment.

17:58.042 --> 17:59.250
Is there a reason for this

17:59.333 --> 18:00.625
or to save time
should I just go ahead

18:00.708 --> 18:02.208
and snap your hands off
at the wrists?

18:02.875 --> 18:04.000
All incoming ships

18:04.083 --> 18:06.333
log their flight paths
through your console.

18:06.417 --> 18:08.333
So, I'm backtracking to find out
which company

18:08.417 --> 18:10.708
sold the routes
to those supply ships.

18:10.792 --> 18:12.083
Do you have any leads?

18:12.167 --> 18:14.583
Possible. Possible.

18:16.667 --> 18:18.875
- 'Ambassador?'
- 'What do you want?'

18:18.958 --> 18:20.167
(Vir)
'The-the-the council meeting'

18:20.250 --> 18:21.333
the emergency session.

18:21.417 --> 18:24.458
The Council.
The council can go to hell.

18:24.542 --> 18:26.708
And the emergency session

18:26.792 --> 18:27.958
can go to hell.

18:28.042 --> 18:29.542
- And you..
- Yes.

18:29.625 --> 18:31.625
You can go to hell too.

18:31.708 --> 18:32.958
I wouldn't want you

18:33.042 --> 18:34.458
to feel left out.

18:35.042 --> 18:36.250
Hmm?

18:36.333 --> 18:37.917
[laughs]

18:39.417 --> 18:40.542
Londo.

18:41.917 --> 18:44.000
Londo, why are you doing this?

18:44.083 --> 18:46.125
[laughs]
Because..

18:46.208 --> 18:47.375
...we are a race

18:47.458 --> 18:50.208
of lunatics and cowards.

18:50.292 --> 18:52.042
I finally received word

18:52.125 --> 18:54.333
'from our glorious leaders.'

18:54.417 --> 18:56.750
Do you know what that convention

18:56.833 --> 18:59.375
of genetic defectives
have decided to do

18:59.458 --> 19:01.542
about the attack
on Ragesh III?

19:01.625 --> 19:03.375
- Hmm?
- Probably they're going to--

19:03.458 --> 19:05.208
After full consideration

19:05.292 --> 19:06.708
of the situation

19:06.792 --> 19:09.625
the great Centauri Republic

19:09.708 --> 19:11.875
the lion of the galaxy...

19:12.667 --> 19:15.375
will do...nothing.

19:17.417 --> 19:18.500
But why?

19:18.583 --> 19:21.333
Because Ragesh III is too far

19:21.417 --> 19:23.667
too small, too unimportant

19:23.750 --> 19:25.667
to risk a confrontation.

19:25.750 --> 19:28.375
And besides, by the time
our ships got there..

19:31.000 --> 19:32.042
[sighs]

19:33.708 --> 19:37.500
Besides, by the time
our ships got there...

19:37.583 --> 19:39.833
...everyone
would be dead anyways.

19:43.375 --> 19:45.042
So..

19:45.125 --> 19:47.083
No-no, Londo, Londo, please. No.

19:47.875 --> 19:48.750
No!

19:48.833 --> 19:50.125
[glass shattering]

19:50.208 --> 19:51.958
[laughs]
Damn all of them!

19:57.500 --> 19:59.083
Does, uh, that mean

19:59.167 --> 20:00.917
we cancel the council meeting?

20:01.833 --> 20:03.458
No, listen to me.

20:03.542 --> 20:05.250
You will not repeat
a word of this.

20:06.042 --> 20:07.667
'We have heard nothing.'

20:07.750 --> 20:08.792
Is that clear?

20:08.875 --> 20:10.958
If we can get others
to step in

20:11.042 --> 20:12.792
perhaps we can embarrass
those idiots

20:12.875 --> 20:14.625
back home into doing something.

20:14.708 --> 20:15.792
Do you understand?

20:15.875 --> 20:17.792
But if-if they find out
that we've lied

20:17.875 --> 20:18.958
then-then we're in big trouble.

20:19.042 --> 20:20.750
Do you understand?

20:20.833 --> 20:23.833
Absolutely, absolutely
understand.

20:29.875 --> 20:31.125
[automated voice]
'Destination?'

20:31.208 --> 20:32.250
Blue 14.

20:38.042 --> 20:39.917
Mr. Garibaldi,
may I ask you a question?

20:41.042 --> 20:42.792
I've tried twice to talk to

20:42.875 --> 20:44.375
Lt. Commander Ivanova

20:44.458 --> 20:46.958
and I don't know
if it's me or her

20:47.042 --> 20:49.333
but I can't get through.

20:49.417 --> 20:51.583
'I can't imagine what it is
I've done to upset her.'

20:52.458 --> 20:55.208
Well...unlike me

20:55.292 --> 20:57.708
'Lt. Commander takes a while
to warm up to people'

20:57.792 --> 20:59.333
especially when she's working.

20:59.417 --> 21:01.875
Tell you what, when she
gets off duty at 1800 hours

21:01.958 --> 21:04.542
she always stops by the casino
to wind down.

21:04.625 --> 21:06.375
That might be a good time
to talk to her.

21:07.917 --> 21:10.917
Alright, I'll try it. Thanks.

21:11.750 --> 21:13.500
Afterward, if you like

21:13.583 --> 21:16.250
you can stop by my quarters..

21:16.333 --> 21:20.042
...I can show you my favorite
thing in the whole universe.

21:20.125 --> 21:22.750
Okay, okay, my second
favorite thing in the universe.

21:38.292 --> 21:40.208
I see we have similar habits.

21:41.792 --> 21:42.833
Before going into battle

21:42.917 --> 21:44.208
I also need to

21:44.292 --> 21:45.958
walk in the green for a moment.

21:46.750 --> 21:47.958
We've recently managed

21:48.042 --> 21:51.208
to restore a few forests
on my world.

21:51.292 --> 21:53.958
It was all green, of course

21:54.042 --> 21:57.167
before the Centauri
stripped it bare.

21:57.250 --> 21:59.750
And now you plan
to return the favor.

22:03.250 --> 22:04.375
Is that it?

22:04.458 --> 22:06.333
I will confess
that I look forward

22:06.417 --> 22:07.708
to the day
when we've cleansed

22:07.792 --> 22:09.208
the universe of the Centauri

22:09.292 --> 22:10.458
and carve their bones

22:10.542 --> 22:13.875
into little flutes
for Narn children.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.417
It's just a dream I have.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.625
Be careful, Ambassador.

22:16.708 --> 22:18.125
Not every dream
I've heard lately

22:18.208 --> 22:19.667
ends well for you.

22:20.917 --> 22:23.542
In our position,
you would do the same.

22:23.625 --> 22:25.667
Our two worlds, our two species

22:25.750 --> 22:27.917
'are more alike
than you might think.'

22:28.833 --> 22:29.750
I would remind you

22:29.833 --> 22:31.042
that we were one of the few

22:31.125 --> 22:32.500
who would supply you
with the weapons

22:32.583 --> 22:33.917
you needed in your war

22:34.000 --> 22:35.750
with the Minbari.

22:35.833 --> 22:37.375
We supported you.

22:38.333 --> 22:39.917
You owe us.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.542
Not a chance.

22:41.625 --> 22:43.292
You didn't support anyone.

22:43.375 --> 22:44.750
Narns will sell to anyone

22:44.833 --> 22:46.417
who can afford the credits.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.583
But I'll give you points
on one thing, Ambassador.

22:48.667 --> 22:51.000
We are alike in one respect.

22:51.083 --> 22:52.500
We've had plenty
of experience

22:52.583 --> 22:53.625
with sneak attacks.

22:53.708 --> 22:55.333
'Pearl Harbor, the terrorist'

22:55.417 --> 22:56.708
'nuking of San Diego'

22:56.792 --> 22:59.250
'the destruction of
our first Mars colony.'

22:59.333 --> 23:01.583
It's a long and bloody history.

23:01.667 --> 23:03.500
Do you know
what we learnt from it?

23:03.583 --> 23:04.667
That the sneak attack

23:04.750 --> 23:06.125
is the first resort
of a coward.

23:06.208 --> 23:07.083
Just a minute.

23:07.167 --> 23:08.167
You didn't even have the decency

23:08.250 --> 23:09.417
to pick a military target.

23:09.500 --> 23:12.417
A poorly-armed civilian colony.

23:12.500 --> 23:14.250
What a challenge that
must have been to the great

23:14.333 --> 23:15.708
Narn military.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.292
What's wrong, ambassador?

23:18.375 --> 23:20.625
Don't have the guts
for a fair fight?

23:21.750 --> 23:23.458
In another place,
I would have you

23:23.542 --> 23:26.000
skinned alive for saying that.

23:26.083 --> 23:28.167
You want me..

23:28.250 --> 23:29.917
...you know where to find me.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.792
See you in council, Ambassador.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.292
[door slides open]

23:46.875 --> 23:47.917
Commander.

23:48.750 --> 23:50.000
We got trouble.

23:50.083 --> 23:51.583
I worked out
how the Raiders operate.

23:51.667 --> 23:52.958
The shipping companies
buy access

23:53.042 --> 23:54.167
to the jump gates in bulk

23:54.250 --> 23:55.667
then sell it on the open market.

23:55.750 --> 23:56.917
One company sold the routes

23:57.000 --> 23:59.125
for all the supply ships
that have been hit.

23:59.208 --> 24:00.542
Turns out their
data crystals suddenly

24:00.625 --> 24:01.625
just blew last month.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.125
Flat lined the whole system.

24:03.208 --> 24:05.125
Sounds like someone
cracked their data bank.

24:05.208 --> 24:06.667
Exactly, only one ship booked

24:06.750 --> 24:08.750
before the data crash
hasn't been attacked yet.

24:08.833 --> 24:10.500
My guess is they'll hit it
in six hours

24:10.583 --> 24:12.250
when it comes out of hyperspace.

24:12.333 --> 24:14.000
- Not much time.
- No.

24:14.083 --> 24:15.292
But here's the tough part.

24:15.375 --> 24:17.083
The ship's technically
a supply vessel, alright

24:17.167 --> 24:20.125
but this time it got booked
by a refugee export service.

24:20.208 --> 24:21.500
There are over 500 men

24:21.583 --> 24:23.542
women and children on that ship.

24:23.625 --> 24:25.292
'If the Raiders get there
before we do..'

24:26.250 --> 24:27.417
...they're dead.

24:34.167 --> 24:36.208
(male #2)
'You have got the entire Senate'

24:36.292 --> 24:38.375
up in arms over this, Commander.

24:38.458 --> 24:40.167
You've exceeded your authority.

24:40.250 --> 24:41.875
If we don't stop
the Narn aggression

24:41.958 --> 24:43.167
they'll just keep coming.

24:43.250 --> 24:45.042
The only way to do that
is to get the council

24:45.125 --> 24:47.125
to authorize
military intervention.

24:47.208 --> 24:49.333
I am asking you again

24:49.417 --> 24:52.083
to delay the vote.

24:52.167 --> 24:54.208
And I'd like to be able
to see you when I talk to you.

24:54.292 --> 24:55.542
Commander, damn it!

24:55.625 --> 24:57.333
Don't you realize that
we've got an election

24:57.417 --> 24:59.000
in less than 24 hours?

24:59.083 --> 25:01.375
Senator, colonists
are dying there.

25:01.458 --> 25:02.417
That's not the issue.

25:02.500 --> 25:03.792
'We just came out of'

25:03.875 --> 25:04.958
'one war, Commander.'

25:05.042 --> 25:06.667
'What are you trying do?
Start another?'

25:06.750 --> 25:08.083
The Earth Alliance
can't go around

25:08.167 --> 25:10.125
being the galaxy's policeman.

25:10.208 --> 25:11.750
They wanna fight it out.
Let 'em.

25:11.833 --> 25:14.375
'Just keep us out of it at least
till after the election.'

25:14.458 --> 25:16.333
'If you can't
postpone the meeting'

25:16.417 --> 25:18.458
then I am authorized
by the subcommittee

25:18.542 --> 25:19.750
to tell you

25:19.833 --> 25:21.667
to abstain.

25:21.750 --> 25:24.333
Earth has to take
a neutral position.

25:24.417 --> 25:27.583
(Jeffrey)
But that will damage
the Centauri case.

25:27.667 --> 25:30.208
If we pull out,
others might do the same.

25:30.292 --> 25:32.417
Not our problem.
Those are your instructions.

25:32.500 --> 25:34.125
This discussion is concluded.

25:36.875 --> 25:38.833
(Susan)
Just an update on that other
matter, Commander.

25:38.917 --> 25:41.583
Delta flight is standing by
ready to intercept the Raiders.

25:41.667 --> 25:43.000
Well, I hope they're
loaded for bear.

25:43.083 --> 25:44.708
From what Garibaldi
says the Raiders

25:44.792 --> 25:46.458
are packing some
pretty big guns and..

25:48.250 --> 25:49.792
Commander?

25:49.875 --> 25:50.792
That might be it.

25:50.875 --> 25:52.125
Tell Garibaldi to stand down.

25:52.208 --> 25:53.625
I'm taking his place
with the Delta flight.

25:53.708 --> 25:55.667
Should I postpone
the council meeting?

25:55.750 --> 25:57.625
No, look, if I'm at that meeting

25:57.708 --> 25:59.292
I'll have to do something
I don't want to do.

25:59.375 --> 26:00.583
So, let it go on without me.

26:00.667 --> 26:02.875
'You can take my place
on the council.'

26:02.958 --> 26:04.250
'Don't worry.
It's all on the agenda.'

26:04.333 --> 26:05.250
Just take the vote and see

26:05.333 --> 26:07.000
what everyone wants to do.

26:07.083 --> 26:09.333
Any other instructions,
commander?

26:09.417 --> 26:11.083
[sighs]
Lots of them.

26:11.167 --> 26:13.958
Unfortunately, I wasn't able
to find you before I left.

26:14.042 --> 26:16.875
'So, you never heard about
any orders from Earth Central.'

26:16.958 --> 26:19.708
The last thing you heard,
we were voting for sanctions.

26:20.708 --> 26:21.750
Clear?

26:22.875 --> 26:23.958
Yes, sir.

26:24.042 --> 26:25.458
Clear as crystal.

26:34.583 --> 26:37.583
[dramatic music]

26:47.250 --> 26:48.750
Preparing for jump.

26:49.708 --> 26:50.958
All ships stay in formation

26:51.042 --> 26:52.292
when we come out the other side.

26:52.375 --> 26:54.250
Delta-7, you're my wingman.

26:55.417 --> 26:56.750
Confirmed, Delta leader.

27:02.458 --> 27:04.333
[whooshing]

27:06.292 --> 27:08.208
(Susan)
'This meeting of
the Babylon 5 council'

27:08.292 --> 27:10.833
'and the League of Non-Aligned'
Worlds is called to order.

27:10.917 --> 27:12.500
[gavel thudding]

27:12.583 --> 27:14.208
We are convened to vote
on sanctions

27:14.292 --> 27:16.083
against the Narn regime.

27:16.167 --> 27:17.208
'Our options include
the imposition'

27:17.292 --> 27:18.708
'of planetary blockade--'

27:18.792 --> 27:20.708
- If it please the council--
- Ambassador G'Kar.

27:20.792 --> 27:22.250
I' would like to remind
the council

27:22.333 --> 27:24.417
that before
the Centauri Republic

27:24.500 --> 27:26.042
invaded our sector

27:26.125 --> 27:28.458
and began their
100-year reign of terror

27:28.542 --> 27:31.042
Ragesh III was a Narn colony.

27:31.125 --> 27:32.875
Now that we are free
of the invaders

27:32.958 --> 27:35.042
it is our right to reclaim it.

27:35.125 --> 27:37.125
We recognize the prior claim.

27:37.208 --> 27:39.542
But the reality
is that Ragesh III

27:39.625 --> 27:42.750
has been Centauri property
for over a century.

27:42.833 --> 27:43.917
'To start a war'

27:44.000 --> 27:46.750
'over blood spilled so long ago'

27:46.833 --> 27:48.625
Where does it end?

27:48.708 --> 27:50.792
You kill them
and take their land

27:50.875 --> 27:53.125
they kill you
and take the land back.

27:53.208 --> 27:55.250
'On and on and on.'

27:55.333 --> 27:56.667
'A cycle of hatred.'

27:56.750 --> 27:58.750
Justice, not hatred.

27:58.833 --> 28:01.125
We have no desire
to start a war.

28:05.667 --> 28:08.125
(Jeffrey)
'Alright, check
instrumentation.'

28:08.208 --> 28:11.000
Keep scanning
on all frequencies.

28:11.083 --> 28:13.583
This sector is the last
transfer point for the refugees.

28:13.667 --> 28:16.625
If the Raiders are gonna hit
anywhere, this has got to be it.

28:16.708 --> 28:18.083
Confirmed lock.

28:18.167 --> 28:19.583

28:24.250 --> 28:25.958
Locking on.

28:26.042 --> 28:27.417
(Jeffrey)
'Magnifying.'

28:28.667 --> 28:30.792
Confirm sighting.
Full thrusters.

28:30.875 --> 28:32.625
Maintain formation
until contact

28:32.708 --> 28:33.958
'then break and attack.'

28:37.750 --> 28:39.458
(G'Kar)
'Our forces came
for the peaceful'

28:39.542 --> 28:41.417
'liberation of Ragesh III.'

28:41.500 --> 28:42.833
We did not fire first

28:42.917 --> 28:44.625
and I can prove it.

28:44.708 --> 28:46.708
I direct your attention
to the monitors.

28:48.875 --> 28:50.000
'We are about to receive'

28:50.083 --> 28:52.958
a live broadcast
from Ragesh III.

28:53.042 --> 28:55.333
I believe it may
clarify the debate.

28:59.125 --> 29:02.000
My name is Carn Mollari.

29:02.083 --> 29:04.458
'I am head researcher
and project director'

29:04.542 --> 29:06.917
'for the Ragesh III
agricultural colony.'

29:07.000 --> 29:08.792
The nephew, I would add,
of our own

29:08.875 --> 29:11.625
esteemed Ambassador
Londo Mollari.

29:11.708 --> 29:13.042
(Carn)
'In the last six months'

29:13.125 --> 29:14.542
there have been
violent outbreaks

29:14.625 --> 29:17.250
created by division
among our many colonists.

29:18.333 --> 29:20.417
'We asked for help..'

29:20.500 --> 29:22.083
'...from Centauri Prime.'

29:22.958 --> 29:24.375
'There was no reply.'

29:26.167 --> 29:28.208
'Faced with chaos and anarchy'

29:28.292 --> 29:30.875
the Ragesh III
Administrative Council

29:30.958 --> 29:33.000
asked for assistance

29:33.083 --> 29:35.000
from the neighboring
Narn regime.

29:35.083 --> 29:36.792
That's not true.

29:36.875 --> 29:38.000
'We have chosen'

29:38.792 --> 29:40.042
of our own free will..

29:41.500 --> 29:42.667
...to ally ourselves

29:42.750 --> 29:44.375
with the Narn government.

29:45.792 --> 29:47.542
'We will, of course,
maintain social'

29:47.625 --> 29:50.042
and economic ties
to Homeworld..

29:51.333 --> 29:53.458
...in the interest
of continued peace.

29:55.875 --> 29:57.667
This is Carn Mollari..

29:57.750 --> 29:58.833
...Ragesh III..

30:00.708 --> 30:01.792
'...signing off.'

30:03.458 --> 30:06.542
[indistinct chatter]

30:11.917 --> 30:13.917
(Londo)
'Don't you understand?'

30:14.000 --> 30:15.958
'Can't you see what
they're trying to do?'

30:16.042 --> 30:18.792
They forced him
to read that statement.

30:18.875 --> 30:21.542
I'm sure, they threatened
to kill him. It's a lie!

30:21.625 --> 30:23.708
If you want to talk
about lies, Ambassador

30:23.792 --> 30:25.250
what about your lie of omission?

30:25.333 --> 30:27.083
Is it not true
that your own world

30:27.167 --> 30:28.750
voted against taking
any action

30:28.833 --> 30:30.875
in response to
the liberation of Ragesh III?

30:30.958 --> 30:32.083
Yes, but--

30:32.167 --> 30:33.792
Then why have you
asked this council

30:33.875 --> 30:36.500
to take actions
that even your own government

30:36.583 --> 30:38.792
considers inappropriate?

30:43.000 --> 30:45.583
This council should not be used

30:45.667 --> 30:48.583
to carry out your own
personal vendettas.

30:49.917 --> 30:51.958
I move that this council
now vote

30:52.042 --> 30:55.292
'to dismiss all charges
against the Narn regime.'

30:56.167 --> 30:57.542
Is there a second?

31:01.250 --> 31:03.750
Please call the vote.

31:03.833 --> 31:05.708
[instrumental music]

31:11.625 --> 31:12.875
(Jeffrey)
'This is Commander
Jeffrey Sinclair'

31:12.958 --> 31:14.167
'of Babylon 5
to raiding party.'

31:14.250 --> 31:16.458
'Surrender your vessels
or be destroyed.'

31:21.583 --> 31:23.292
Repeat, surrender your vessels

31:23.375 --> 31:24.542
or be destroyed.

31:25.583 --> 31:27.667
[firing]

31:27.750 --> 31:29.667
Oh, I assume,
I can take that as a no.

31:31.542 --> 31:33.750
And cut velocity..

31:33.833 --> 31:34.875
...now.

31:45.542 --> 31:48.083
(male #3)
'Delta leader, Raiders
are breaking off.'

31:48.167 --> 31:50.375
'Do we pursue
and continue attack?'

31:50.458 --> 31:51.667
Negative. The cruiser's hit.

31:51.750 --> 31:53.208
'We can't afford
to leave it alone.'

31:53.292 --> 31:55.750
'Deltas 2 through 6 plus 8
assume escort position

31:55.833 --> 31:56.833

(male #4 on radio)
'Roger, Delta leader.'

32:03.875 --> 32:05.250
(Jeffrey)
'Activate long-range scanners'

32:05.333 --> 32:07.417
'wideband search
for transmissions.'

32:09.417 --> 32:10.833
Commander, are we heading
the wrong way?

32:10.917 --> 32:13.000
The Raiders went
in the opposite direction.

32:13.083 --> 32:14.708
Exactly, which is what I'd do

32:14.792 --> 32:16.000
if I wanted to decoy fighters

32:16.083 --> 32:18.292
away from a command
and control ship.

32:18.375 --> 32:20.125
Picking up transmissions.

32:21.083 --> 32:22.500
A C And C transport

32:22.583 --> 32:23.750
that looks a lot..

32:25.667 --> 32:26.792
'like that.'

32:30.083 --> 32:31.125
'Gotcha!'

32:31.750 --> 32:34.792
[intense music]

33:04.542 --> 33:07.583
[music continues]

33:27.292 --> 33:29.292
Blood calls out for blood.

33:36.875 --> 33:37.958
Oh, excuse me.

33:38.625 --> 33:40.042
Oh, I'm sorry.

33:43.125 --> 33:44.083
G'Kar!

33:44.167 --> 33:45.250
[screams]

33:48.750 --> 33:49.792
No.

33:50.792 --> 33:51.833
'No.'

33:54.083 --> 33:55.417
If you'll excuse me.

33:58.333 --> 34:00.833
Ambassador. Ambassador, no!

34:06.875 --> 34:08.000
Garibaldi.

34:15.875 --> 34:17.583
- Londo?
- Mr. Garibaldi.

34:17.667 --> 34:18.875
I have to talk to you.

34:18.958 --> 34:20.458
You'll excuse me, another time.

34:20.542 --> 34:22.208
What's wrong with now?

34:22.292 --> 34:23.833
You have someplace
special to go?

34:23.917 --> 34:25.875
Mr. Garibaldi

34:25.958 --> 34:27.583
get out of my way.

34:28.917 --> 34:30.750
No, I can't do that.

34:32.208 --> 34:33.958
Go back to your quarters, Londo.

34:34.042 --> 34:35.292
No!

34:35.375 --> 34:37.458
Don't force me
to make this official.

34:37.542 --> 34:38.583
No!

34:40.208 --> 34:41.667
I don't wanna do it..

34:41.750 --> 34:43.042
...but lay one finger
on a weapon

34:43.125 --> 34:44.833
and I'll kill you
where you stand.

34:47.750 --> 34:50.708
- You don't understand.
- Yes, I do.

34:50.792 --> 34:52.708
I understand better
than you'll ever know.

34:53.750 --> 34:55.000
'I know it burns, Londo.'

34:55.083 --> 34:56.750
I know the things
it makes you wanna do

34:56.833 --> 34:58.917
but this isn't the way.
Not now and not here!

34:59.000 --> 35:00.583
He's my blood, my nephew.

35:00.667 --> 35:02.500
But if you kill G'Kar,
none of those colonists

35:02.583 --> 35:04.958
will get out alive.
You have to know that.

35:07.833 --> 35:08.875
Yes.

35:10.917 --> 35:12.167
Well, it seems I'm still

35:12.250 --> 35:13.500
on target

35:13.583 --> 35:14.625
for my appointment

35:14.708 --> 35:16.500
20 years from now.

35:16.583 --> 35:19.208
- What appointment?
- It's a long story.

35:19.292 --> 35:20.833
Perhaps another time.

35:24.750 --> 35:26.833
Ambassador?

35:26.917 --> 35:28.542
In one hour, I'm going
to have to check

35:28.625 --> 35:29.667
your quarters for weapons.

35:29.750 --> 35:31.708
Make sure I don't find anything.

35:34.875 --> 35:36.167
'Mr. Garibaldi?'

35:37.000 --> 35:39.042
Just now..

35:39.125 --> 35:41.208
...would you really
have killed me?

35:42.500 --> 35:44.833
Yes. Yes, I would have.

35:47.208 --> 35:49.625
But I'm just as glad
I didn't have to.

35:49.708 --> 35:51.667
The paperwork's
a pain in the butt.

36:07.708 --> 36:09.708
I understand there's a problem?

36:09.792 --> 36:11.750
I'm afraid there is,
ambassador..

36:11.833 --> 36:13.667
...and I'm afraid it's you.

36:13.750 --> 36:15.542
(Jeffrey)
'We managed to drive the Raiders
out of this sector.'

36:15.625 --> 36:17.542
At least for now,
but look what I found

36:17.625 --> 36:19.500
on the command and control ship.

36:21.542 --> 36:24.042
[speaking in foreign language]

36:24.125 --> 36:25.625
I kept wondering
where the Raiders

36:25.708 --> 36:27.250
were getting
their heavy weapons.

36:27.333 --> 36:28.917
Then I thought
about our conversation.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.333
Narns will sell to anyone

36:30.417 --> 36:31.583
who can afford to pay.

36:31.667 --> 36:33.625
Just like they did
during the war.

36:33.708 --> 36:35.500
Your government always
provides an advisor

36:35.583 --> 36:37.083
'to show how to operate
the weapons'

36:37.167 --> 36:39.042
'and to make sure
they aren't resold'

36:39.125 --> 36:40.583
to a third party.

36:40.667 --> 36:42.958
When we tracked the Raider's
command and control ship

36:43.042 --> 36:45.625
we disabled her, went aboard

36:45.708 --> 36:47.333
and found your friend here.

36:47.417 --> 36:48.917
And that's not all.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.583
When the ship docked
and we went inside

36:50.667 --> 36:53.875
we found these data crystals.

36:53.958 --> 36:55.500
They contain reports,
the captain here monitored

36:55.583 --> 36:57.792
between Ragesh III
and Narn Central Command.

36:57.875 --> 37:00.125
They confirm everything
Ambassador Mollari said

37:00.208 --> 37:02.458
about the attack
on the Centauri colony

37:02.542 --> 37:03.542
'that it was unprovoked.'

37:03.625 --> 37:04.792
'And that the invitation'

37:04.875 --> 37:06.417
'was made at the point
of a gunpoint.'

37:06.500 --> 37:08.542
'Now, it seems to me
that you have two choices.'

37:08.625 --> 37:11.292
Tell your forces on Ragesh III
to withdraw..

37:11.375 --> 37:13.667
...or we bring this evidence
to the council.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.042
Chief?

37:25.333 --> 37:26.417
Your choice..

37:27.083 --> 37:28.167
...ambassador.

37:35.833 --> 37:39.125
Right so, this should make Londo
a happy man.

37:39.208 --> 37:41.833
Oh, well, not to mention
Earth Central.

37:41.917 --> 37:43.042
We did it without sanctions.

37:43.125 --> 37:44.708
and the polls
haven't even closed.

37:44.792 --> 37:46.542
Polls! I almost forgot to vote.

37:46.625 --> 37:47.708
Better get going.

37:47.792 --> 37:49.583
Then it's a quite evening
at my place

37:49.667 --> 37:51.250
with my second favorite thing
in the universe.

37:51.333 --> 37:53.542
Assuming I can find someone
to share it with.

37:53.625 --> 37:55.458
Garibaldi,
I don't even wanna know.

37:57.417 --> 38:00.333
(woman on TV)
'With 5% of returns in
from the American'

38:00.417 --> 38:02.208
'Russian and Chinese states'

38:02.292 --> 38:04.542
'incumbent
President Luis Santiago'

38:04.625 --> 38:07.083
'leads Mari Crane
by 12 percent.'

38:07.167 --> 38:08.375
'though outline regions'

38:08.458 --> 38:09.875
'may favor the challenger.'

38:10.417 --> 38:11.458
Water.

38:15.792 --> 38:17.375
(male #4)
'Here you go, ma'am.'

38:17.458 --> 38:18.500
Thank you.

38:28.167 --> 38:30.833
I wanted to thank you
for your help this afternoon.

38:30.917 --> 38:33.042
The situation
with the Centauri ambassador.

38:33.125 --> 38:34.417
Oh, it was an accident, really.

38:34.500 --> 38:38.292
I've been trained to block out
casual thoughts, but..

38:38.375 --> 38:40.208
...when you hit something
that powerful..

38:41.625 --> 38:42.833
I understand.

38:46.500 --> 38:48.833
I feel I should explain
my behavior earlier.

38:50.125 --> 38:51.750
I was rude.

38:51.833 --> 38:53.667
It's alright.

38:53.750 --> 38:55.708
I just wanted to know
if it was me.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.333
It's what you represent.

39:07.875 --> 39:10.375
[sighing]
My mother was like you..

39:11.125 --> 39:13.250
...a telepath.

39:13.333 --> 39:17.208
None of us ever knew. It was
her secret since she was a girl.

39:17.292 --> 39:19.958
And she wasn't trained, she was
never able to use it well.

39:20.042 --> 39:22.083
So, that's why we have
the Psi Corps

39:22.167 --> 39:23.542
to help telepaths.

39:23.625 --> 39:25.833
Bring out their talents
to the fullest.

39:27.208 --> 39:28.792
Yes, I imagine that's
what they told you.

39:30.667 --> 39:31.875
Were you raised by the Corp?

39:31.958 --> 39:33.250
Mmm-hmm.

39:33.333 --> 39:35.208
- Here you go.
- Hmm.

39:35.292 --> 39:37.000
Then you never
had to make the choice.

39:38.833 --> 39:39.958
When they discover what you are

39:40.042 --> 39:42.458
they give you three choices.

39:42.542 --> 39:44.667
You can either
join the Psi Corps..

39:44.750 --> 39:46.792
...or go to prison.

39:46.875 --> 39:48.083
Or agree to take certain drugs

39:48.167 --> 39:50.292
for the rest of your life.

39:50.375 --> 39:52.625
Drugs that inhibit
your telepathic abilities.

39:53.250 --> 39:54.375
That's the law.

39:55.292 --> 39:56.500
Unregistered telepaths

39:56.583 --> 39:57.833
have to be controlled

39:57.917 --> 40:00.167
in order to protect
the privacy of others.

40:01.500 --> 40:02.792
Have you ever seen the results?

40:08.083 --> 40:10.250
They caught up with my mother
on her 35th birthday.

40:11.417 --> 40:13.500
She didn't want
to join the Corps

40:13.583 --> 40:14.750
didn't want to go to prison.

40:15.708 --> 40:17.125
So they gave her the treatment.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.417
For 10 years,
a man in a gray suit

40:20.500 --> 40:22.208
came to the door once a week.

40:23.250 --> 40:24.958
And he gave her the injections.

40:26.917 --> 40:28.417
They were strong.

40:29.292 --> 40:30.583
'Terribly strong.'

40:32.083 --> 40:34.208
Every day we just watched her

40:34.292 --> 40:36.417
drift further and further
away from us.

40:39.083 --> 40:41.542
The light in her eyes
just went out bit by bit.

40:43.375 --> 40:45.125
And when we thought
she could go no further..

40:46.625 --> 40:48.042
...she took her own life.

40:52.625 --> 40:53.792
I'm sorry.

40:58.125 --> 40:59.708
What happened back then..

40:59.792 --> 41:01.375
...is not your fault.

41:03.125 --> 41:04.875
But it's part of what you are.

41:06.542 --> 41:08.917
And yet you're as much
of a victim as my mother.

41:12.125 --> 41:13.833
I don't feel like a victim.

41:15.917 --> 41:16.958
No.

41:19.042 --> 41:20.208
And so far I cannot tell

41:20.292 --> 41:23.417
if it is good...or bad.

41:27.833 --> 41:29.458
Perhaps tomorrow..

41:29.542 --> 41:31.875
...we can start out
on better terms.

41:31.958 --> 41:33.667
I very much doubt it.

41:34.833 --> 41:36.000
Goodnight.

41:36.917 --> 41:39.333
[instrumental music]

41:45.917 --> 41:46.958
(Dr. I.Q. Hi on TV)
'The only remaining source'

41:47.042 --> 41:47.958
'is on Planet X..'

41:48.042 --> 41:49.958
'...somewhere in this area.'

41:50.042 --> 41:52.125
And you want me
to find Planet X?

41:52.208 --> 41:53.500
Is that it?

41:53.583 --> 41:56.417
Can you do it, Dodgers?

41:56.500 --> 41:58.625
This is my second favorite thing
in the universe.

41:59.667 --> 42:01.042
Watch this. Watch.

42:01.125 --> 42:03.250
Like Duck Dodgers

42:03.333 --> 42:05.500
in the 24th-and-a-half

42:05.583 --> 42:07.167
century.

42:07.250 --> 42:08.750
(Garibaldi)
'God, I love this stuff.'

42:08.833 --> 42:10.375
[Garibaldi laughs]

42:15.917 --> 42:17.833
Explain this part to me again.

42:22.833 --> 42:24.708
(Duck Dodgers)
'Had the silly thing
in reverse.'

42:31.708 --> 42:35.042
With 70 percent of the vote
tallied, we are declaring

42:35.125 --> 42:37.583
incumbent
President Luis Santiago

42:37.667 --> 42:40.208
the victor over challenger
Marie Crane.

42:40.292 --> 42:42.583
'Santiago's campaign
was based on a promise'

42:42.667 --> 42:46.208
'to cut the budget
and to keep Earth out of war.'

42:46.292 --> 42:47.667
'His agenda for the coming term'

42:47.750 --> 42:50.000
'includes creating
a closer relationship'

42:50.083 --> 42:52.708
'with the Mars colony
and a greater emphasis

42:52.792 --> 42:54.333
'on preserving Earth cultures'

42:54.417 --> 42:57.292
'in the face of growing
non-Terran influences.'

42:57.375 --> 42:58.417
End.

43:03.292 --> 43:06.167
Lights and goodnight.

43:06.250 --> 43:07.625
(Susan)
'Commander, there's a problem.'

43:09.083 --> 43:10.167
'Commander?'
