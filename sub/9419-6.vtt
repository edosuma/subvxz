>> in all of this, I've kind of

06:54.381 --> 06:56.848
Been proving to myself, you

06:56.850 --> 06:58.150
Know, that I could kill

06:58.152 --> 06:59.117
Past habits.

06:59.119 --> 07:02.120
I could get kind of--jealousy

07:02.122 --> 07:03.321
And things get the best of me.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.055
>> and then you'd, like,

07:04.057 --> 07:04.956
Stalk a girl.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.024
>> well, not--I don't know about

07:06.026 --> 07:07.025
All that, but--

07:07.027 --> 07:08.326
>> but kind of.

07:08.328 --> 07:09.161
>> yeah.

07:09.163 --> 07:10.228
>> you've been trying to be good

07:10.230 --> 07:12.564
By, like, not following up and

07:12.566 --> 07:13.799
Trying to find more out

07:13.801 --> 07:14.499
About her.

07:14.501 --> 07:16.401
>> here's another thing about

07:16.403 --> 07:18.136
Kelsey that, I mean, I hadn't

07:18.138 --> 07:19.371
Really mentioned before.

07:19.373 --> 07:20.906
She actually has body dysmorphic

07:20.908 --> 07:23.341
Disorder.

07:23.343 --> 07:24.609
>> you mean she looks in the

07:24.611 --> 07:25.877
Mirror and sees someone that's

07:25.879 --> 07:26.545
Not her.

07:26.547 --> 07:27.279
>> mm-hmm.

07:27.281 --> 07:28.313
When she brought that up, I kind

07:28.315 --> 07:30.148
Of backed off in saying, you

07:30.150 --> 07:31.716
Know, "send me pictures or get

07:31.718 --> 07:34.186
On cam," because I understand

07:34.188 --> 07:34.986
The issues.

07:34.988 --> 07:35.787
>> the voice thing

07:35.789 --> 07:36.488
I don't understand.

07:36.490 --> 07:37.456
>> the voice.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.191
You know, it is what it is.

07:39.193 --> 07:39.925
That's the way I see it.

07:39.927 --> 07:42.294
It's just like, okay...

07:42.296 --> 07:45.831
What are you gonna do?

07:45.833 --> 07:47.032
>> well, why don't you show us

07:47.034 --> 07:48.133
What she looks like?

07:48.135 --> 07:51.937
>> okay.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.171
>> wow.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.474
>> one thing I did do is I took

07:55.476 --> 07:56.208
The images and I put them in

07:56.210 --> 07:58.743
Reverse, like, image search, and

07:58.745 --> 07:59.411
There wasn't anything

07:59.413 --> 08:00.078
When I did that.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.013
So really it was just me, "okay,

08:02.015 --> 08:03.248
Give me more," like, maybe she's

08:03.250 --> 08:04.583
Got a photo book, and I can look

08:04.585 --> 08:05.283
At more of them.

08:05.285 --> 08:06.318
And just, you know, that's where

08:06.320 --> 08:07.786
I was kind of was like, "yeah,

08:07.788 --> 08:08.687
Give me more, give me more,

08:08.689 --> 08:10.455
Give me more," you know?

08:10.457 --> 08:12.357
>> they don't really look like

08:12.359 --> 08:14.192
Photos of a girl who seems that

08:14.194 --> 08:16.461
Insecure about herself.

08:16.463 --> 08:17.996
>> yeah. I mean, body dysmorphic

08:17.998 --> 08:19.798
Disorder--I know it how it

08:19.800 --> 08:20.499
Manifests.

08:20.501 --> 08:21.766
I know how some days, they

08:21.768 --> 08:23.368
Might, you know--they might see

08:23.370 --> 08:24.569
Something that's okay,

08:24.571 --> 08:26.938
And sometimes they might be

08:26.940 --> 08:28.206
Horrified at it.

08:28.208 --> 08:28.874
>> right.

08:28.876 --> 08:30.041
>> I kind of felt like I need

08:30.043 --> 08:31.009
To be there for her

08:31.011 --> 08:32.110
In any capacity.

08:32.111 --> 08:33.745
You know, I do care for her in

08:33.746 --> 08:38.850
That way.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.652
>> have you guys dabbled in the

08:40.654 --> 08:43.321
Dark arts of, uh, sexting?

08:43.323 --> 08:44.656
>> well, I've sent her a dick

08:44.658 --> 08:45.657
Pic once.

08:45.659 --> 08:46.892
>> with your face in it?

08:46.894 --> 08:48.093
>> no.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.561
I'm not that foolish.

08:49.563 --> 08:51.263
>> you sent her a dick pic?

08:51.265 --> 08:51.963
>> yes.

08:51.965 --> 08:52.631
>> you don't even have

08:52.633 --> 08:53.298
Her phone number.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.066
>> I was in the mood.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.167
>> what did she say?

08:56.169 --> 08:57.536
>> we just kind of continued on

08:57.538 --> 08:59.337
With our--with our chatting.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.505
>> she didn't reciprocate?

09:00.507 --> 09:01.406
>> no.

09:01.408 --> 09:02.574
>> that might actually be a good

09:02.576 --> 09:04.142
Thing, the fact that she maybe

09:04.144 --> 09:06.344
Was more coy maybe means

09:06.346 --> 09:07.546
That it really is her.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.447
>> you can see what little I'm

09:09.449 --> 09:10.248
Working with.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.149
>> is it frustrating,

09:11.151 --> 09:12.050
Having so little?

09:12.052 --> 09:13.418
>> it's very frustrating.

09:13.420 --> 09:15.086
It's this element of not knowing

09:15.088 --> 09:18.156
That's so scary to me and, you

09:18.158 --> 09:19.357
Know, the fear of pushing her

09:19.359 --> 09:21.693
Away.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.695
>> would you be open to

09:23.697 --> 09:25.363
Exploring a relationship with

09:25.365 --> 09:26.865
Someone who wasn't the person in

09:26.867 --> 09:28.700
Those pictures?

09:28.702 --> 09:30.802
>> that would really depend on

09:30.804 --> 09:32.737
What happened when we opened

09:32.739 --> 09:33.572
Pandora's box.

09:33.574 --> 09:34.739
It's like, I need to know one

09:34.741 --> 09:35.941
Way or another if I'm getting

09:35.943 --> 09:38.043
Duped or if this can go forward,

09:38.045 --> 09:38.877
So...

09:38.879 --> 09:40.378
>> would you be heartbroken if

09:40.380 --> 09:41.713
This didn't work out?

09:41.715 --> 09:43.448
>> yeah.

09:43.450 --> 09:44.649
I think I would.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.518
>> ♪ I can't keep learning ♪

09:46.520 --> 09:49.220
♪ the same lessons over again

09:49.222 --> 09:51.389
♪ I keep learning the same

09:51.391 --> 09:52.824
♪ lessons over

09:52.826 --> 09:54.526
>> there's definitely a chance.

09:54.528 --> 09:55.427
>> mm-hmm.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.228
>> we'll see, as we investigate,

09:57.230 --> 09:58.363
If that chance increases or

09:58.365 --> 09:59.097
Decreases.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.498
But I'm pulling for you.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.367
All right, dude.

10:02.369 --> 10:03.568
>> john.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.203
>> I hope to hear from you soon.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.338
>> all right, my man.

10:06.340 --> 10:09.207
>> see you, everybody.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.743
>> he's a very smart guy.

10:11.745 --> 10:15.213
He must really be in love with

10:15.215 --> 10:16.982
This girl in order to basically

10:16.984 --> 10:19.918
Overlook all the very obvious

10:19.920 --> 10:20.752
Red flags.

10:20.754 --> 10:21.453
>> right.

10:21.455 --> 10:23.488
>> it doesn't how smart you are.

10:23.490 --> 10:25.290
This can happen to anyone.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.925
>> ♪ I just keep learning

10:26.927 --> 10:30.829
♪ the same lessons over again

10:30.831 --> 10:34.766
>> we got a smart guy...

10:34.768 --> 10:35.500
>> but a little lonely.

10:35.502 --> 10:36.368
>> named john...

10:36.370 --> 10:37.035
>> little lonely.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.370
>> who kind of lives in his

10:38.372 --> 10:39.971
Cyber world.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.006
What are the chances that he

10:41.008 --> 10:42.641
Meets a beautiful girl in a

10:42.643 --> 10:44.109
Skype chat room about

10:44.111 --> 10:44.843
Psychology?

10:44.845 --> 10:46.378
>> this girl has given him some

10:46.380 --> 10:48.346
Pretty bogus excuses.

10:48.348 --> 10:49.614
I mean, body dysmorphic

10:49.616 --> 10:51.016
Disorder--that's a real thing,

10:51.018 --> 10:51.683
But--

10:51.685 --> 10:52.484
>> yes, but it's hypocritical

10:52.486 --> 10:53.652
For her to send images

10:53.654 --> 10:54.819
In a bathing suit.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.855
She's showing off her body.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.423
>> it looks like we're dealing

10:58.425 --> 11:00.058
With a pretty clear case of

11:00.060 --> 11:01.393
Catfishing.

11:01.395 --> 11:03.962
>> we don't have a lot to go on.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.497
We got kelsey beelzebub.

11:05.499 --> 11:06.498
>> and some photos.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.565
He sent us this email.

11:07.567 --> 11:08.633
"here's the information I have

11:08.635 --> 11:09.300
On kelsey."

11:09.302 --> 11:10.635
Let's just double-check

11:10.637 --> 11:12.303
His image search, because

11:12.305 --> 11:13.104
Who knows?

11:13.106 --> 11:18.977
Image one, kelsey.

11:18.979 --> 11:19.711
Image number two.

11:19.713 --> 11:20.679
Come on.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.614
No match.

11:22.616 --> 11:25.283
We should message all the

11:25.285 --> 11:26.484
Current members of this

11:26.486 --> 11:27.152
Chat room...

11:27.154 --> 11:28.253
>> yeah.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.387
>> and just say, "hey,

11:29.389 --> 11:30.488
Quick question--

11:30.490 --> 11:33.692
Do any of you know of a girl

11:33.694 --> 11:35.627
Named kelsey beelzebub?"

11:35.629 --> 11:36.461
>> yeah.

11:36.463 --> 11:37.562
>> here are the people that are

11:37.564 --> 11:38.263
In the group.

11:38.265 --> 11:38.930
We'll copy/paste it to

11:38.932 --> 11:39.631
Everybody.

11:39.633 --> 11:40.365
>> okay, okay.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.733
>> I'm sending this to aaron.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.501
Hey, aaron.

11:43.503 --> 11:44.436
>> all right.

11:44.438 --> 11:46.104
>> adam the gambler.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.505
>> pinkko_moon.

>> ellie.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.075
>> cee_n owens.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.476
>> sent.

11:51.478 --> 11:52.977
>> waiting.

11:52.979 --> 11:54.779
>> both: Whoa.

11:54.781 --> 11:55.780
>> we got a message back--

11:55.782 --> 11:57.082
Back from aaron.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.950
>> why don't we video-chat?

11:58.952 --> 12:00.819
[line trilling]

12:00.821 --> 12:01.686
>> hello?

12:01.688 --> 12:02.420
>> yeah, hey, man.

12:02.422 --> 12:03.121
>> hey, aaron.

12:03.123 --> 12:03.822

12:03.824 --> 12:05.790
>> we're trying to identify a

12:05.792 --> 12:06.458
Girl.

12:06.460 --> 12:07.292
You don't know a

12:07.294 --> 12:09.661
Kelsey beelzebub, by any chance,

12:09.663 --> 12:10.495
From that group, do you?

12:10.497 --> 12:11.229
>> yeah.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.731
We, um--we chat.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.199
We don't video-chat or call

12:14.201 --> 12:14.966
Or anything.

12:14.968 --> 12:15.800
But, yeah, we talk.

12:15.802 --> 12:17.302
>> how often do you talk?

12:17.304 --> 12:18.970
>> every day, at least, like--

12:18.972 --> 12:19.971
>> wow. Just a private

12:19.973 --> 12:21.606
Conversation between you guys?

12:21.608 --> 12:22.307
>> yeah.

12:22.309 --> 12:23.942
>> are you guys, like,

12:23.944 --> 12:24.976
Into each other?

12:24.978 --> 12:26.111
>> I don't think so.

12:26.113 --> 12:26.845
It's more like just a

12:26.847 --> 12:27.579
Friendship.

12:27.581 --> 12:28.413
>> and has she ever told you

12:28.415 --> 12:30.148
Anything personal about herself?

12:30.150 --> 12:31.149
>> she told me that she had

12:31.151 --> 12:31.983
Something called body

12:31.985 --> 12:33.952
"demorphia."

12:33.954 --> 12:34.886
>> have you seen pictures

12:34.888 --> 12:35.620
Of her?

12:35.622 --> 12:36.955
>> mm-mm.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.289
Well, she has one on her

12:38.291 --> 12:39.090
Profile.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.024
>> right.

12:40.026 --> 12:40.959
>> but you never video-chat.

12:40.961 --> 12:41.659
>> no.

12:41.661 --> 12:42.994
>> because she doesn't like to

12:42.996 --> 12:44.195
Be seen?

12:44.197 --> 12:45.330
>> I do know that she has

12:45.332 --> 12:46.431
Anxiety.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.399
Adam told me she had anxiety.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.268
>> adam the gambler.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.369
>> yes.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.972
>> is it the young anxiety club?

12:53.974 --> 12:54.773
>> uh, yeah.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.741
Um, that's actually the reason

12:56.743 --> 12:58.443
Why I joined the skype group,

12:58.445 --> 13:00.445
Was because of the fact that

13:00.447 --> 13:02.113
I had anxiety.

13:02.115 --> 13:02.814
>> all right, well, cool.

13:02.816 --> 13:04.182
Maybe we'll be in touch.

13:04.184 --> 13:05.016
But otherwise, thank you.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.184
>> thanks for having me.

13:06.186 --> 13:06.985
>> all right.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.119
>> this is kind of like the

13:08.121 --> 13:10.755
Socially anxious group.

13:10.757 --> 13:11.790
>> that definitely gives a

13:11.792 --> 13:12.657
Little bit more validity
