WEBVTT

00:06.093 --> 00:09.139
If I have to fill out another
college app, I'm gonna scream.

00:09.183 --> 00:10.923
You know how many I did?

00:10.967 --> 00:13.404
13, and I'm still
not done yet.

00:13.448 --> 00:15.102
What do you have left?

00:15.145 --> 00:17.930
Just Northwestern,
which I'm so not getting into.

00:17.974 --> 00:19.584
My mom is making me apply.
Thinks that

00:19.628 --> 00:21.151
just because
my aunt went there,

00:21.195 --> 00:22.848
I can get in
with a 3.3 GPA.

00:24.546 --> 00:25.982
Ooh, ooh-ooh.
Oh.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.418
Hey.

00:27.462 --> 00:29.812
Girls, inappropriate.There's no shame.

00:29.855 --> 00:31.814
Mr. Camp's a
total silver fox.

00:31.857 --> 00:34.425
You hear that, honey? You're
married to a total silver fox.

00:34.469 --> 00:36.166
All right. Get to class.

00:36.210 --> 00:38.299
Volta said his
parents don't care

00:38.342 --> 00:40.301
if anyone drinks at
his house this weekend.

00:40.344 --> 00:41.780
You want to go?

00:41.824 --> 00:43.608
No. Why would I want to go?

00:43.652 --> 00:46.002
You know he's crushing
on you and wants to have,

00:46.046 --> 00:47.960
like, 10,000 of
your babies some day.

00:48.004 --> 00:49.962
Ew!You know, I'm just gonna...

00:51.355 --> 00:53.270
GIRL:
Somebody help him!

01:06.979 --> 01:09.112
Right side clear!Left side clear!

01:10.635 --> 01:12.550
Bang.

01:12.594 --> 01:15.553
All right. Scenario over.

01:15.597 --> 01:17.381
That's better.
It's not perfect.

01:17.425 --> 01:19.949
Deac, you want to be team leader
one day, right?

01:19.992 --> 01:21.907
You got to keep your boys
in sync, every step,

01:21.951 --> 01:23.213
you own the entry.

01:23.257 --> 01:24.823
Luca, I had a clear shot at you.

01:24.867 --> 01:26.521
You got to toss that banger
in at an angle.

01:26.564 --> 01:27.957
All right, you
got it, boss.
Hondo,

01:28.000 --> 01:29.567
you weren't expecting
someone to be here?

01:29.611 --> 01:31.569
Why did you look surprised
when you entered the room?

01:31.613 --> 01:33.267
Just wasn't expecting to see
your beautiful face, Buck.

01:35.660 --> 01:37.488
This house we're hitting
tomorrow is heavily guarded,

01:37.532 --> 01:40.665
so we rehearse until we
get this entry right.

01:40.709 --> 01:43.581
So, let's try this again,
gentlemen. Reset.

01:50.762 --> 01:54.070
Sir.You thought
the entry was that bad?

01:54.114 --> 01:55.767
Not at all, but, uh,

01:55.811 --> 01:58.335
we can't let the hotshots
get too cocky, can we?

01:58.379 --> 02:01.338
Yeah. Doc says
Annie's gonna pop any day.

02:01.382 --> 02:04.863
Damn, Deac. I can't find a girl
I want to take on a second date,

02:04.907 --> 02:06.561
and here you are
having another kid.

02:06.604 --> 02:08.215
Ha! And it's a girl.
You ready, Deac?

02:08.258 --> 02:10.565
I got nieces and nephews.
I can tell you one thing.

02:10.608 --> 02:12.219
Raising a girl's
way different, man.

02:12.262 --> 02:14.351
Oh, yeah. All the scrapes I got
in growing up, my mother said

02:14.395 --> 02:16.223
I was still nothing compared
to dealing with my sister.

02:16.266 --> 02:18.312
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Remind me again

02:18.355 --> 02:20.183
why I'm taking parenting advice
from you two?

02:23.404 --> 02:26.233
All right, let's move.

02:26.276 --> 02:28.844
WOMAN :
Multiple reports of an active
shooter at River Hill High.

02:28.887 --> 02:31.325
We're patching through live
911 calls.

02:31.368 --> 02:33.240
GIRL:
Please help! There's someone
shooting up our school!

02:33.283 --> 02:35.416
GIRL 2:
Amanda's shot!
She's bleeding! Help!

02:35.459 --> 02:37.026
Less than a minute out!

02:37.069 --> 02:39.115
20-David to Command. Can we
confirm any additional units

02:39.159 --> 02:41.117
at the school?COMMAND :
Negative. Closest squad car

02:41.161 --> 02:43.206
is five to seven minutes out.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.512
That means
we'll be the first on scene.

02:44.555 --> 02:45.948
It could be all over

02:45.991 --> 02:47.602
before the secondaries arrive.

02:50.257 --> 02:52.084
This is who we are, gentlemen.

02:52.128 --> 02:55.436
Remember your training.
We're sheep dogs.

02:55.479 --> 02:57.742
Confront the wolf,
protect the flock.

03:05.010 --> 03:07.665
Go, go, go, go, go.Move, move, move, move. Come on.

03:07.709 --> 03:09.885
BUCK:
20-David,

03:09.928 --> 03:11.974
we've got shots fired from
inside River Hill High School.

03:12.017 --> 03:14.542
Go, go! Keep moving.
Back behind the truck!Get behind!

03:14.585 --> 03:16.979
Go! Go! Go! Go, go, go!

03:17.022 --> 03:19.460
Whoa, whoa! Stop!
What do you know?

03:19.503 --> 03:21.462
I'm a resource officer. There's
two shooters on the first floor.

03:21.505 --> 03:22.898
Two shooters?
What are they wearing?Don't know.

03:22.941 --> 03:24.813
Didn't get a good look.Which way?

03:24.856 --> 03:26.467
Through here, or you
can go around there

03:26.510 --> 03:27.642
to the big double doors.Deac, Luca, front side.

03:27.685 --> 03:29.470
Garcia, Stevens,
one, four corner.

03:29.513 --> 03:31.820
Hondo, you're with me.
Let's move, everybody! Go!

03:35.693 --> 03:37.391
Okay. Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.

03:37.434 --> 03:39.175
Go, go, go, go, go.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.873
Okay. let's move,
let's move, let's move.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.310
Go, get out of here.Go, go, go!

03:43.353 --> 03:45.399
Get out of here! Go!Go, go, go, go, go, go.

03:47.052 --> 03:49.054
BUCK: All right, go, go.
Keep moving, keep moving.

03:53.276 --> 03:54.582
Keep going, keep going!
Get away from the door!

04:00.065 --> 04:02.894
Shooter in the south hallway.
We have one student down.

04:02.938 --> 04:03.982
Cover me.
I got you. Go.

04:11.686 --> 04:14.645
My Carmelita, she-she just
couldn't stop crying.

04:14.689 --> 04:18.127
He said he saw the kids,
the blood, everything.

04:18.170 --> 04:19.563
Just glad he's safe.

04:21.086 --> 04:22.740
Principal O'Neil,
are they over here?

04:22.784 --> 04:24.655
Yeah. Any parents not reunited
with their kids should be there.

04:24.699 --> 04:26.701
All right. Thank you.

04:28.355 --> 04:30.357
MAN: Sir?WOMAN:
What's happening?!

04:32.315 --> 04:34.796
Yeah, there was
an active shooter situation,

04:34.839 --> 04:36.624
and there were casualties.

04:36.667 --> 04:39.366
Now, we'll get you all the
information as soon as we can.

04:39.409 --> 04:40.541
What does that mean?Where's my son?

04:40.584 --> 04:41.977
Right now,
I'm looking for a Luke

04:42.020 --> 04:43.805
or an Ainsley Mogavero.

04:46.111 --> 04:48.592
Could you come here, please?

04:51.726 --> 04:53.945
Is he dead?

04:53.989 --> 04:58.559
Mrs. Mogavero,
there were two shooters.

04:58.602 --> 05:01.736
One was captured alive,
and the other one was killed.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.564
Did they hurt my Jeff?

05:03.607 --> 05:07.916
Ma'am, Jeff was
one of the shooters.

05:10.353 --> 05:13.138
One of the sh-shooters?
No, no. There's a mistake.

05:13.182 --> 05:14.749
I need to see him.

05:14.792 --> 05:16.054
I'm afraid that's not possible.

05:16.098 --> 05:18.448
Why not?

05:18.492 --> 05:22.234
Jeff was the shooter
that was killed, ma'am.

05:22.278 --> 05:26.935
I'm sorry, but we we're gonna
need his computer, cell phone,

05:26.978 --> 05:28.458
anything.
Personal journals...

05:28.502 --> 05:30.417
Oh, no!

05:32.462 --> 05:34.421
I'm sorry.

05:34.464 --> 05:35.857
I'm sorry...

05:40.340 --> 05:41.819
Not a day goes by that
I don't think about

05:41.863 --> 05:43.430
changing my last name.

05:43.473 --> 05:46.998
When people hear Mogavero,
I can see them thinking:

05:47.042 --> 05:50.132
"Why does that name
sound so familiar?"

05:50.175 --> 05:52.439
All I can do is hope
that they don't remember.

05:52.482 --> 05:54.919
I need to ask you something I
know you've thought a lot about

05:54.963 --> 05:57.008
over the past six years.

05:57.052 --> 06:00.795
Could you have stopped what
happened at River Hill High?

06:00.838 --> 06:04.059
People want to think that
this couldn't happen to them,

06:04.102 --> 06:05.626
that they're better parents.

06:05.669 --> 06:07.410
The last time
I saw my son

06:07.454 --> 06:09.281
was that morning before school.

06:09.325 --> 06:10.761
When he said good-bye to me,

06:10.805 --> 06:13.416
there was genuine sadness
in his voice,

06:13.460 --> 06:15.723
and that will haunt me
for the rest of my life,

06:15.766 --> 06:20.249
because my son was experiencing
real mental distress,

06:20.292 --> 06:22.643
and I didn't know
the warning signs.

06:22.686 --> 06:25.254
I thought I was involved in
his life, but the reality is,

06:25.297 --> 06:27.517
I wasn't digging deep enough.

06:27.561 --> 06:29.258
Because if I had been,

06:29.301 --> 06:31.391
I would've gotten him
the help that he needed.

06:31.434 --> 06:33.610
And yes, I could've
stopped River Hill.

06:33.654 --> 06:37.527
Is there anything you want
to say to the victims' families?

06:40.008 --> 06:43.011
If I could give my life

06:43.054 --> 06:48.451
to save just one of the lives
my son took that day, I would.

06:48.495 --> 06:52.673
What he did that day
made him a monster,

06:52.716 --> 06:57.329
but it didn't stop him
from being my son.

06:57.373 --> 06:59.723
He will always be my son.

06:59.767 --> 07:03.553
I'm so sorry for what he did.

07:24.095 --> 07:26.489
All right, one more, Deac.
One more, one more. Yeah...

07:26.533 --> 07:29.840
Eh, you're dragging a bit today,
big man. What's going on?

07:29.884 --> 07:31.538
You still moonlighting
with my boy Dee Fletch?

07:31.581 --> 07:33.191
He giving you hell or something?

07:33.235 --> 07:34.889
Yeah, him and Annie both.

07:34.932 --> 07:36.717
I shouldn't say that, actually.
She, she knows we need

07:36.760 --> 07:38.370
the extra money, and she's been
pretty understanding

07:38.414 --> 07:41.156
about me, uh,
not being around as much,

07:41.199 --> 07:42.636
but I-I can tell it bothers her.

07:42.679 --> 07:44.986
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

07:45.029 --> 07:46.553
my boy Dee loves you, man.

07:46.596 --> 07:49.164
He says security at his place
has never been tighter.

07:49.207 --> 07:51.253
Don't be afraid to ask
that cat for a raise.

07:51.296 --> 07:52.733
You got to love it
when one boss tells you to ask

07:52.776 --> 07:54.735
the other boss for a raise.

07:54.778 --> 07:56.563
Hondo.

07:56.606 --> 07:58.086
You see this?

08:05.136 --> 08:06.137
Is that who I think it is?

08:09.010 --> 08:10.011
What's she doing here?

08:10.054 --> 08:12.492
Who is she?
No idea.

08:14.145 --> 08:15.973
I opened it this morning
and came straight here.

08:16.017 --> 08:17.584
No name, no address?

08:17.627 --> 08:19.107
"They all say I'm crazy,

08:19.150 --> 08:20.804
"but they'll learn
how smart I am.

08:20.848 --> 08:22.458
"They'll be sorry
for the way

08:22.502 --> 08:23.981
they treated me."
Why does this sound so familiar?

08:24.025 --> 08:25.809
It's from my son Jeff's
manifesto.

08:25.853 --> 08:28.333
I wish it had been burned
and never leaked.

08:28.377 --> 08:30.292
"Your son blazed a path
for the rest of us.

08:30.335 --> 08:31.946
"By the time
you read this today,

08:31.989 --> 08:34.122
"you'll see on TV
how I've honored Jeff

08:34.165 --> 08:36.124
"by amassing
a higher body count

08:36.167 --> 08:38.039
with the same gun."

08:38.082 --> 08:40.476
Six kids were killed that day.HONDO:
Seven.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.826
When you include the shooter.

08:44.741 --> 08:46.134
The letter says,

08:46.177 --> 08:48.049
"By the time you read this."

08:48.092 --> 08:49.180
Uh, my mail's delivered
at the beginning

08:49.224 --> 08:50.617
of the day, not the end.So he wasn't

08:50.660 --> 08:53.010
expecting you to get this
until this afternoon.

08:53.054 --> 08:55.317
So whoever it is is planning
that attack for today.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.406
Yeah.

09:38.447 --> 09:40.405
Does it say which school?
Anything to narrow it down?

09:40.449 --> 09:43.800
No, nothing. Just
a lot of anger.

09:43.844 --> 09:45.889
Postmark shows it was
sent from here in L.A.,

09:45.933 --> 09:49.197
so we have to assume the
target's an L.A. County school.

09:49.240 --> 09:52.200
Doc, how credible
do you think this threat is?

09:52.243 --> 09:55.420
Very. This letter is
essentially a mini-manifesto.

09:55.464 --> 09:57.858
Too detailed and specific
to be a prank.

09:57.901 --> 09:59.816
The way he says,
"you'll see me on TV,"

09:59.860 --> 10:03.211
he's not just looking for
revenge, he's after notoriety.

10:03.254 --> 10:05.517
By killing more classmates
than the River Hill shooters?

10:05.561 --> 10:06.910
That can't happen.

10:06.954 --> 10:08.651
Is it too late to shut down
the schools?

10:08.695 --> 10:11.654
A mid-day evacuation
of over 2,700 schools?

10:11.698 --> 10:13.221
Even if I can
convince the Mayor,

10:13.264 --> 10:15.266
the suspect just waits for them
to open again to attack.

10:15.310 --> 10:17.007
It could also cause mass panic.

10:17.051 --> 10:18.661
That's exactly what he's after.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.489
If this were about
jocks bullying him,

10:20.532 --> 10:22.273
he would have written about
taking out the bleachers

10:22.317 --> 10:23.535
at a football game.

10:23.579 --> 10:25.581
If he wanted revenge
on the popular kids,

10:25.625 --> 10:27.365
he would've targeted prom night.

10:27.409 --> 10:31.282
This isn't about classmates
fearing a specific event.

10:31.326 --> 10:33.110
No, he wants them to
fear their daily lives.

10:33.154 --> 10:37.767
What he's attacking is a symbol
of his oppression, his school.

10:37.811 --> 10:41.075
Cortez, notify school PD

10:41.118 --> 10:43.077
that we have
an immediate tactical alert.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.992
We need all off-duty
resource officers

10:45.035 --> 10:46.776
to provide backup
at their posts.

10:46.820 --> 10:49.083
I'll coordinate with the chief
to assign cars outside campuses.

10:49.126 --> 10:50.693
Yeah. Let's see if
we can identify

10:50.737 --> 10:52.782
this suspect
before he strikes.

10:52.826 --> 10:56.394
Sir, do you remember
six years ago?

10:56.438 --> 10:59.223
We were minutes away when
that first shot was fired,

10:59.267 --> 11:01.269
and a lot of kids
still lost their lives.

11:01.312 --> 11:04.054
By the time some call comes in,
it's gonna be too late.

11:04.098 --> 11:05.882
Well, what do
you suggest?

11:05.926 --> 11:08.885
Every year the school board
sends the LAPD a student list

11:08.929 --> 11:12.062
of the ones that are most likely
to be threats-- we start there.

11:12.106 --> 11:15.544
We need to be proactive, but
that's a needle in a haystack.

11:15.587 --> 11:18.199
Wendy, what else
does this letter tell you?

11:18.242 --> 11:21.593
Mostly that he worships these
two River Hill High shooters.

11:21.637 --> 11:23.944
He looks up to them
the way some kids

11:23.987 --> 11:26.076
look up to athletes
or pop stars.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.599
Everything's in motion.

11:27.643 --> 11:29.732
What else should we be doing?

11:29.776 --> 11:31.908
We took one of
the River Hill shooters alive.

11:31.952 --> 11:33.214
Maybe whoever wrote
this letter

11:33.257 --> 11:34.737
tried to contact him
in prison.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.739
Guards vet those letters
as they come in.

11:36.783 --> 11:39.916
He would have been flagged.Not if it didn't
hint at an attack.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.439
Well, it's worth
checking out.

11:41.483 --> 11:43.311
But leave some of
your team behind

11:43.354 --> 11:46.053
so they can help go through
the school board's threat list.

11:46.096 --> 11:47.141
And, Hondo...

11:47.184 --> 11:49.099
You're right.

11:49.143 --> 11:52.320
We can't let River Hill
happen again.

11:54.626 --> 11:56.454
TERRENCE:
These boxes are full

11:56.498 --> 11:58.239
of everything,
from marriage proposals

11:58.282 --> 12:01.155
to requests for old Patrick
here to go to hell.

12:01.198 --> 12:03.287
Going back at
least a few years.

12:05.507 --> 12:07.422
HONDO: Do you know
why we're here?

12:07.465 --> 12:08.945
Anyone contact you
recently

12:08.989 --> 12:11.295
about plans to copy your attack?

12:11.339 --> 12:12.557
Not in those boxes.

12:12.601 --> 12:13.950
We'd have caught that.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.822
Sometimes admirers
write to me.

12:15.865 --> 12:17.780
Admirers?

12:17.824 --> 12:20.740
I always write back saying
I wish I'd never done it,

12:20.783 --> 12:24.308
that I never should have let
Jeff talk me into any of it.

12:24.352 --> 12:27.485
Which of these letters
are from your admirers?

12:27.529 --> 12:29.009
I know you.

12:29.052 --> 12:31.489
You're damn right you know me.

12:32.882 --> 12:34.710
You think we forgot
what you did?
No.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.973
I swear, the first thing
I do every day

12:37.017 --> 12:39.019
is say the names
of those six victims,

12:39.062 --> 12:40.585
remembering
who they were.

12:40.629 --> 12:42.849
I know that Steve wanted
to join the Navy, and Melanie...

12:42.892 --> 12:46.113
Stop talking, okay?
You do not get to
say their names.

12:46.156 --> 12:49.638
HONDO: Patrick, there's a lot
of letters here-- any mention

12:49.681 --> 12:51.118
specifics about what you did?

12:51.161 --> 12:53.381
Or anything on the same gun
you and Jeff used?

12:53.424 --> 12:56.645
Look through here, maybe.

12:56.688 --> 12:58.908
Officer, have you ever been
at the Golden Gate Bridge

12:58.952 --> 13:01.519
in San Francisco?

13:01.563 --> 13:03.652
Yeah.Did you know

13:03.695 --> 13:05.175
that jumping
doesn't always kill you,

13:05.219 --> 13:06.829
and that
almost all the survivors

13:06.873 --> 13:08.526
say that the second
they stepped off,

13:08.570 --> 13:11.007
they felt instant regret?

13:11.051 --> 13:12.704
And that's what you felt?

13:12.748 --> 13:14.663
Instant regret?In that moment,

13:14.706 --> 13:16.360
they realized that everything

13:16.404 --> 13:20.843
they thought couldn't be fixed
in their life was fixable.

13:20.887 --> 13:23.324
Except for having just jumped.

13:23.367 --> 13:25.935
Some things
you can't ever take back.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.850
STREET:
Boss.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.373
Check it out.

13:29.417 --> 13:30.897
It's a TEC-9.

13:33.595 --> 13:36.206
That's the same type of
gun that you used, isn't it?

13:38.208 --> 13:40.341
This is postmarked
a month ago.

13:40.384 --> 13:41.559
Has this person
written to you before?

13:41.603 --> 13:43.083
I don't think so.

13:44.084 --> 13:46.042
I got the serial number.

13:46.086 --> 13:47.565
We can run it
through NECS.
All right.

13:47.609 --> 13:49.393
Find out where it was
sold and who bought it.

13:49.437 --> 13:51.569
Pack this up. Send Captain
Cortez the number.

13:51.613 --> 13:52.570
Officer,
before you go,

13:52.614 --> 13:54.050
I wanted to say thank you

13:54.094 --> 13:55.530
for...
For what?

13:55.573 --> 13:57.532
Not killing you that day?

13:58.620 --> 14:00.491
No.

14:00.535 --> 14:02.972
For stopping me
before more of them died.

14:09.152 --> 14:12.112
Green one.
Deac, move.

14:14.157 --> 14:15.811
Hands! Hands!Hands!

14:15.855 --> 14:17.857
Hey. Where are
the shooters?

14:17.900 --> 14:19.771
Upstairs. Jeff Mogavero
and Patrick Demers.

14:19.815 --> 14:21.164
They just came in
and started shooting.

14:21.208 --> 14:23.514
Okay, go, go. Go, go.
Out of the building.

14:23.558 --> 14:25.647
Go. Get out!

14:28.998 --> 14:30.304
DEACON:
Now.

14:34.961 --> 14:36.310
LUCA:
Clear.

14:39.139 --> 14:40.792
LUCA: Whoa! Down hands!Don't shoot!

14:40.836 --> 14:43.447
It's okay, it's okay.
Have you seen the shooters,

14:43.491 --> 14:45.145
Jeff and Patrick?One of them is on this floor.

14:45.188 --> 14:47.451
What do you mean?
They separated?

14:48.539 --> 14:50.150
All right, this way.

14:50.193 --> 14:51.629
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Go, go, go.

14:51.673 --> 14:53.153
Get behind me.
30-David, the shooters

14:53.196 --> 14:55.459
have separated, I repeat,
the shooters have separated.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.722
One is on the second floor, the
other one's on the first floor.

14:57.766 --> 14:59.028
I have students here
in the southside stairwell.

14:59.072 --> 15:01.074
HICKS: Copy. Send them
down to the south exit

15:01.117 --> 15:03.250
then go after the shooter
on the second floor.

15:03.293 --> 15:05.948
I need you to go to the bottom
of the stairs quietly.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.211
Deacon, I got a student,
Lila, on the line with intel

15:08.255 --> 15:10.561
on the whereabouts
of the shooter closest to you.

15:10.605 --> 15:12.302
I'm patching her through.DEACON: Roger.

15:12.346 --> 15:15.001
Lila? If you can hear me,
this is Sergeant Kay.

15:15.044 --> 15:16.480
Where are you?

15:16.524 --> 15:18.787
: We're hiding
in the closet please send help.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.528
Okay, all right.
Listen, don't panic.

15:20.571 --> 15:22.660
I need you to stay calm.
What room number are you in?

15:22.704 --> 15:25.228
Um... r-room number...208.

15:25.272 --> 15:27.839
: 208, 208.It's 208. It's 208.

15:27.883 --> 15:29.406
DEACON: Okay, Lila.
Listen to me.

15:29.450 --> 15:31.669
You hang in there
and we will find you.

15:31.713 --> 15:34.281
DEACON: Lila?

15:34.324 --> 15:36.152
Oh, my God, he's here.

15:36.196 --> 15:37.980
Move. All right.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.329
Stay as quiet as you can.
We're coming.

15:44.073 --> 15:46.467
Okay, lights off. He must've
set off some smoke bombs.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.608
30-David, we're taking fire
on the second floor.

15:57.652 --> 15:58.827
Luca, do you see him?

15:58.870 --> 16:00.176
No. Cover me here.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.920
Hey. Kid. Kid, you all right?

16:06.052 --> 16:08.880
Hey.

16:08.924 --> 16:10.621
DEACON:
30-David.

16:10.665 --> 16:11.971
We got a victim down.

16:12.014 --> 16:14.886
: Second
floor, room 2-0-2.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.861
STREET: Guy seems to feel
genuine remorse

16:32.904 --> 16:35.037
about what he did.Look, I don't care
how bad he feels;

16:35.081 --> 16:36.734
he could be a living
saint right now,

16:36.778 --> 16:38.475
wouldn't matter to me.No, I get it.

16:38.519 --> 16:40.477
I'm just saying, at least
he's trying to help us now.

16:40.521 --> 16:42.044
Look, you weren't
there six years ago.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.046
How can you get it?I mean...

16:44.090 --> 16:45.569
I might not
have been there,

16:45.613 --> 16:47.354
but I've seen my share
of messed-up stuff, dude.

16:47.397 --> 16:49.182
I saw my mom
shoot my dad.
Okay, so how

16:49.225 --> 16:50.748
can you defend this guy, then?

16:50.792 --> 16:53.229
I saw innocent kids
bleeding out on the floor

16:53.273 --> 16:55.188
because of him.And he's in prison

16:55.231 --> 16:56.885
for the rest of his life.

16:56.928 --> 16:59.105
The rest of his life.

16:59.148 --> 17:02.195
He's living, okay?
Those kids he murdered?

17:02.238 --> 17:04.197
They're never gonna
get that same chance.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.025
He should have died
just like his buddy.

17:09.376 --> 17:11.378
Anything?
There's enough names
in the threat list,

17:11.421 --> 17:13.858
they could have
their own school.
Seems like
all you got

17:13.902 --> 17:15.251
to do to get written up
is wear black and

17:15.295 --> 17:17.297
look at someone the wrong way.How could she not know

17:17.340 --> 17:18.472
what was happening
in her own house?

17:18.515 --> 17:19.995
CHRIS: My cousin had
clinical depression

17:20.039 --> 17:21.649
and we didn't find out
for the longest time.

17:21.692 --> 17:23.433
Yeah, but you did
find out.

17:23.477 --> 17:26.480
Yeah, well, that
mom carries it.

17:26.523 --> 17:28.003
And now she's
trying to do good

17:28.047 --> 17:30.179
to make up for all
the bad her son did.

17:30.223 --> 17:31.746
Like giving speeches?

17:31.789 --> 17:34.009
Making money off
it, getting famous?

17:34.053 --> 17:36.055
We can use that.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.534
Ainsley.

17:37.578 --> 17:39.841
You have over 200,000
Twitter followers, right?

17:39.884 --> 17:41.364
Yes.
Wendy, you said

17:41.408 --> 17:42.844
the kid who
wrote the letter

17:42.887 --> 17:44.846
idolizes her son.
Mm-hmm.

17:44.889 --> 17:47.153
What if we use her
to contact him?

17:47.196 --> 17:49.633
You think he follows me
on Twitter?He might.

17:49.677 --> 17:51.896
And if he responds,
we can keep him busy.

17:51.940 --> 17:54.247
Which might buy us
enough time to find him.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.336
What if Ainsley tweets out
"I got your letter today,

17:56.379 --> 17:57.902
"I'd like to discuss
it with you.

17:57.946 --> 17:59.382
Please DM me?"JESSICA: Do it.

17:59.426 --> 18:01.210
Talk her through what
to say if he responds.Got it.

18:01.254 --> 18:03.778
We got a hit on the TEC-9 from
the photo Street sent us.

18:03.821 --> 18:06.085
Ran its serial
numbers through NECS.

18:06.128 --> 18:07.608
Traced to this buyer.

18:07.651 --> 18:09.740
Kurt Wilson. He's our guy?

18:09.784 --> 18:12.134
There was a Kurt Wilson
on the school's threat list.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.527
Expelled two years ago...

18:13.570 --> 18:15.964
and last known address
on the Eastside.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.400
Check DMV, see if
there's any vehicles

18:17.444 --> 18:18.619
registered to that address.

18:18.662 --> 18:20.142
Uh, the only
vehicle registered

18:20.186 --> 18:21.622
to that address
is a '97 pickup.

18:21.665 --> 18:23.145
Get your team
over there.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.625
I'm gonna secure a search
warrant for evidence

18:24.668 --> 18:26.148
and issue a BOLO
on that truck.

18:31.675 --> 18:33.242
DISPATCH :
Dispatch to 20-David.

18:33.286 --> 18:34.896
Adam-23 has eyes
on the '97 pickup truck

18:34.939 --> 18:36.463
at the 2100 block.

18:36.506 --> 18:38.987
Central Ave, East L.A.
Requesting immediate backup.

18:39.030 --> 18:41.076
Suspect is believed to be armed.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.296
Advise Adam-23
we are 30 seconds out.

18:43.339 --> 18:44.775
Pin the vehicle,
set up and cover.

18:44.819 --> 18:46.125
We got to figure out

18:46.168 --> 18:47.735
a way to take this guy alive.

18:47.778 --> 18:49.911
Either confirm he's our shooter
or find out who has his gun.

18:49.954 --> 18:51.913
Yeah, we're en route, Deac.
We'll meet you there.

19:01.183 --> 19:03.751
Show me your hands, now!

19:03.794 --> 19:05.579
Do not think, just do it.

19:05.622 --> 19:07.189
Both hands, now!

19:10.149 --> 19:12.977
Chris, Tan.
Sage and Hopper guns.

19:13.021 --> 19:14.805
HONDO:
Go.

19:14.849 --> 19:16.633
He's reaching!

19:16.677 --> 19:18.026
Depositing pepper balls.

19:19.723 --> 19:21.029
LUCA:
Cover, cover.

19:21.072 --> 19:22.770
Cover me.

19:22.813 --> 19:25.251
Get up, get to the car.
Give me your hands.

19:27.514 --> 19:29.211
Where's the gun?

19:29.255 --> 19:30.604
In the front seat.

19:30.647 --> 19:32.432
It's clear, boss.

19:32.475 --> 19:35.261
No, no. The TEC-9.

19:35.304 --> 19:37.263
What are you talking about?The TEC-9
that you purchased

19:37.306 --> 19:38.786
in Reseda last week.
Where is it?

19:38.829 --> 19:40.483
I want a lawyer.
Look.

19:40.527 --> 19:42.616
It's not worth whatever
you're gonna do to your school.

19:42.659 --> 19:44.139
School? What school?

19:44.183 --> 19:46.185
I-I'm not saying anything
without a lawyer.

19:47.925 --> 19:50.493
You really have no idea what
we're talking about, do you?

19:55.890 --> 19:57.326
What are you doing up?

19:58.327 --> 19:59.894
A few hours ago you were

19:59.937 --> 20:02.984
too sick to go to school,
now you're fine?

20:03.027 --> 20:04.812
Vince.

20:07.858 --> 20:09.338
You know how I feel

20:09.382 --> 20:11.210
about locked
doors in my house.

20:11.253 --> 20:12.733
I want this lock

20:12.776 --> 20:15.562
taken off by the
end of this week.

20:15.605 --> 20:17.477
If you're suddenly
feeling better,

20:17.520 --> 20:19.218
you can go to school.

20:27.008 --> 20:28.488
Look, we don't know who this is,

20:28.531 --> 20:30.185
but we do know
he's holding your gun.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.534
Which you didn't report stolen.Look, man,

20:31.578 --> 20:33.275
we don't want to charge you,
we just need

20:33.319 --> 20:34.972
to find this kid
before he uses it.DEACON: Look.

20:35.016 --> 20:36.974
Just-just trade us the name,
you can walk out of here.

20:37.018 --> 20:38.280
On your good word?

20:38.324 --> 20:40.239
You see that serial number?

20:40.282 --> 20:42.980
We traced it; you bought
that thing a week ago.

20:43.024 --> 20:46.201
All I see is a guy who's not
my client holding a gun.DEACON: If that kid

20:46.245 --> 20:48.290
is underage, it's a felony
to sell him that gun.

20:48.334 --> 20:49.770
Okay, look, fellas.

20:49.813 --> 20:52.076
My client doesn't have to say
anything and you know it.

20:52.120 --> 20:54.165
If you want any
cooperation from us,

20:54.209 --> 20:55.993
there's no way around it.
We need a guarantee.

20:56.037 --> 20:58.518
Immunity in writing that
promises he'll be cleared.

20:58.561 --> 21:01.129
We don't have time for that.DEACON: Listen,
that kid made

21:01.172 --> 21:03.218
a direct threat to shoot
up a school... today.

21:03.262 --> 21:06.308
With a gun that was sold
to him by your client.HONDO: Six years ago,

21:06.352 --> 21:07.831
I responded to a school shooting

21:07.875 --> 21:10.094
and I had to step over
children's bodies.

21:10.138 --> 21:11.748
All because someone
like your client

21:11.792 --> 21:13.707
provided guns to
those killers.

21:15.535 --> 21:17.798
You want a promise? Say nothing.

21:17.841 --> 21:19.930
And then when this kid goes
out and kills his classmates

21:19.974 --> 21:21.845
with your gun
in the next hour or so,

21:21.889 --> 21:23.369
we ain't gonna be
coming after you for

21:23.412 --> 21:25.588
felony gun charges,
we are gonna charge you as

21:25.632 --> 21:27.329
an accessory to a mass murder.

21:27.373 --> 21:30.245
So you go ahead and sit in
that chair and shut your mouth.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.725
But that is my promise to you.

21:35.990 --> 21:37.905
Okay. O-Okay.

21:37.948 --> 21:40.081
Just... hang on.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.173
I don't want any kids hurt.

21:49.264 --> 21:51.222
Kurt gave us the name Vince.

21:51.266 --> 21:53.268
And a phone number,
but it's a burner.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.357
The suspect's
name is Vince?
Yeah.

21:55.401 --> 21:57.272
One of the Twitter messages
I got back

21:57.316 --> 21:59.361
was by a username
with "Vince" in it.

21:59.405 --> 22:01.537
Show us.

22:01.581 --> 22:03.060
Okay.

22:04.453 --> 22:06.890
We need confirmation
it's the same Vince.

22:06.934 --> 22:09.719
Ask, "In his letter you
mentioned a gun, what type?"

22:13.157 --> 22:15.769
That's him.
Keep him talking.

22:15.812 --> 22:17.684
How fast can we get Twitter
to release this person's info?

22:17.727 --> 22:20.295
We've worked with them before,
but there's a process.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.428
They'll prioritize once
they hear what it's about.

22:22.471 --> 22:23.733
I'll get Judge Whitt
to expedite a subpoena.

22:23.777 --> 22:25.082
The longer you can
keep Vince chatting,

22:25.126 --> 22:26.867
the better chance we
have of stopping him.

22:26.910 --> 22:30.087
Respond by saying you want
to tell him about your son,

22:30.131 --> 22:33.439
things no one knows
besides you.

22:46.452 --> 22:47.583
It's to prevent
an attack on a school.

22:47.627 --> 22:48.889
We need the info right away.

22:48.932 --> 22:51.065
Yeah, I'll be sending
the warrant any minute.

22:51.108 --> 22:53.589
Hold on.Judge signed the warrant.

22:53.633 --> 22:54.634
I'm sending you the paperwork
right now.

22:54.677 --> 22:56.549
Cortez confirmed
that our suspect,

22:56.592 --> 22:59.421
Vince Franz, is a 17-year-old
senior at Hammond Ridge High.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.249
Vandelli's team
and school PD have

23:01.292 --> 23:03.251
an additional 25 units
at Vince's school.

23:03.294 --> 23:04.557
Wasn't he already in school?No. They couldn't find him,

23:04.600 --> 23:05.819
so there's a good chance
he's at his house.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.429
We know he's serious enough

23:07.473 --> 23:08.952
to buy an illegal
extended magazine.

23:08.996 --> 23:11.172
This kid is ready
and willing to raise hell.

23:11.215 --> 23:12.826
So let's take
care of business,

23:12.869 --> 23:14.393
and confront the wolf.

23:15.306 --> 23:16.351
What's that?

23:16.395 --> 23:18.701
Something Buck used to say.

23:21.356 --> 23:24.968
HONDO: LAPD. Move, move, move.
Get out of here.

23:25.012 --> 23:26.622
BUCK: Okay. Let's go. Everybody
move. I want everybody out.

23:26.666 --> 23:28.407
Let's go, let's go.
Let's go. Move.

23:28.450 --> 23:29.625
LAPD. Move, move.
Let's go.

23:29.669 --> 23:32.628
Ladies, go. Now.

23:32.672 --> 23:35.239
Hondo.
Here. Here.

23:35.283 --> 23:36.850
Is everyone okay?

23:36.893 --> 23:38.547
No. My friend Christopher is
hurt really bad, right there.

23:38.591 --> 23:41.202
And I think there's a hurt
teacher right there.

23:44.205 --> 23:46.816
Metro SWAT. Are you good?I'm okay.

23:48.992 --> 23:50.559
Put your hand here.
Keep the pressure.

23:50.603 --> 23:53.649
Help my wife and the kids
in the cafeteria, out that way.

23:53.693 --> 23:55.259
Where's the shooter?He's in there, too.

23:55.303 --> 23:58.480
Just went in,
wearing a black cap.

23:58.524 --> 24:00.830
We got multiple shots
in the cafeteria.Everyone stay down!

24:00.874 --> 24:02.658
Shooter last seen wearing
a black baseball cap.

24:02.702 --> 24:03.659
20-David in pursuit.

24:03.703 --> 24:06.140
Everybody, stay down! Stay down!

24:32.558 --> 24:34.603
LAPD!Oh, my God!

24:34.647 --> 24:35.691
It's okay.Where's the shooter?

24:35.735 --> 24:38.259
In the kitchen.Move. Move. Go.

24:52.273 --> 24:54.884
20-David has eyes
on the shooter.

24:54.928 --> 24:57.626
He's carrying
a semi-auto hand gun.

24:57.670 --> 24:59.062
We're moving in to engage.

25:04.807 --> 25:05.808
LAPD!

25:14.208 --> 25:17.341
There's no movement inside.
We ready to make entry?

25:20.170 --> 25:22.259
"I wish I could've done
River Hill with them.

25:22.303 --> 25:23.260
"They were so wise.

25:23.304 --> 25:24.958
"I thought talking to you

25:25.001 --> 25:27.090
"would be the next closest thing
to talking to your son."

25:27.134 --> 25:28.352
Tell him:
"My son was wrong.

25:28.396 --> 25:31.704
You don't need to make
his mistakes."

25:40.626 --> 25:43.150
Set.

25:43.193 --> 25:45.587
Move, move, move, move, move.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.371
Breach in three, two...

25:52.594 --> 25:55.118
Two, two, two, two.

25:55.162 --> 25:56.250
Two, two!

25:56.293 --> 25:57.294
Give me two,
give me two!

25:57.338 --> 25:58.818
"The only thing
he was wrong about

25:58.861 --> 26:00.907
was that he should've
killed you first."

26:08.218 --> 26:09.219
We got somebody.

26:22.885 --> 26:25.584
No Vince Franz, no TEC-9,
and he left his cell phone here.

26:25.627 --> 26:26.976
So we won't be able
to track him.

26:27.020 --> 26:28.587
Any sign of him at his school?

26:28.630 --> 26:30.458
Vandelli's team is
at Hammond Ridge now.

26:30.501 --> 26:32.503
Vince never showed for class.

26:32.547 --> 26:35.942
Hey, I need to get through.
That's my house.

26:35.985 --> 26:37.334
Captain, hold on a second.

26:37.378 --> 26:38.379
Can I go through, please?

26:38.422 --> 26:39.598
Hey, let her through.

26:41.295 --> 26:42.905
That's my house.
What's going on?

26:42.949 --> 26:44.907
What's your name?Whitney Franz.

26:44.951 --> 26:46.256
Vince Franz is your brother?

26:46.300 --> 26:47.910
Where is he?
I don't know.

26:47.954 --> 26:49.390
School? What's going on?

26:49.433 --> 26:51.087
We need to locate your brother.

26:51.131 --> 26:53.394
Did he tell you about any
problems at Hammond Ridge High?

26:53.437 --> 26:55.744
No. He's only been there, like,
two weeks; he's been doing fine.STREET: Two weeks?

26:55.788 --> 26:56.745
Where'd he go before that?

26:56.789 --> 26:59.095
Leighton.
Leighton High?

26:59.139 --> 27:00.619
Wait, Vince had problems there?
Not at Hammond Ridge?

27:00.662 --> 27:02.098
Yeah, he was expelled.

27:02.142 --> 27:04.057
Now, will you please
tell me what's going on?

27:04.100 --> 27:06.799
Where's my mom?Chris.

27:06.842 --> 27:07.843
Hey.

27:09.323 --> 27:11.455
Captain, we got a problem.

27:11.499 --> 27:13.501
I think we've been guarding
the wrong school.

27:13.544 --> 27:14.763
Principal Cullen, we believe

27:14.807 --> 27:16.069
one of your former students

27:16.112 --> 27:17.592
has plans to attack your school.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.289
His name is Vince Franz.

27:19.333 --> 27:21.291
So we're the target.
What should we do?

27:21.335 --> 27:22.553
How many armed guards are there?

27:22.597 --> 27:24.643
Two of our resource officers
are here now.

27:24.686 --> 27:26.645
That's not enough to protect
1,600 students.

27:26.688 --> 27:27.950
Should we evacuate?

27:27.994 --> 27:29.473
HICKS:
No, he could show up any minute,

27:29.517 --> 27:31.084
that could put you
right in the line of fire.

27:31.127 --> 27:33.652
What if she moves all the
students to one large area

27:33.695 --> 27:36.045
and has the officers
guard the doors?

27:38.308 --> 27:39.745
The gym.

27:39.788 --> 27:41.181
CULLEN:
Only two entrances,

27:41.224 --> 27:42.965
locks from the inside,
no exposed windows.

27:43.009 --> 27:44.401
HICKS:
Move your students

27:44.445 --> 27:45.881
and faculty there
as fast as you can.

27:45.925 --> 27:47.491
Get them safe.
We're on our way.

27:50.146 --> 27:51.713
Yes, ma'am. Okay.

27:51.757 --> 27:55.543
Principal Cullen wants
everyone to the gym.

27:55.586 --> 27:57.588
Let's go. Leave your bags.

27:57.632 --> 27:59.982
Hurry.

28:09.818 --> 28:11.428
Let's move.Get to the gym.

28:11.472 --> 28:13.300
Let's go, let's go. Let's go.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.397
Before some of you were SWAT,

28:23.440 --> 28:25.007
Buck talked about how most
of the world

28:25.051 --> 28:26.008
is made up of peaceful folks

28:26.052 --> 28:28.184
who avoid violence at all cost.

28:28.228 --> 28:31.231
He called them the flock.

28:31.274 --> 28:34.060
He would also say
you have wolves;

28:34.103 --> 28:36.976
people who use violence
to attack that flock.

28:37.019 --> 28:39.761
And there's one remaining group.

28:39.805 --> 28:41.807
Those who live to protect
that flock

28:41.850 --> 28:44.287
and confront those wolves.

28:44.331 --> 28:47.769
That group's the sheepdogs,
and that is who we are.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.728
That is why we are SWAT.

28:49.771 --> 28:51.338
I know today's
brought back some

28:51.381 --> 28:53.732
bad memories for those of us
who were there six years ago.

29:01.261 --> 29:04.873
Well, let's make sure
this time's different.

29:04.917 --> 29:06.875
You were there?

29:11.706 --> 29:13.273
Protect the flock.

29:15.884 --> 29:18.234
Elijah, keep them
going that way.Got it.

29:18.278 --> 29:19.888
Captain Ruane is here
to take point.

29:19.932 --> 29:22.238
You the K9 unit?

29:22.282 --> 29:23.979
Officer Alonso, sir.

29:24.023 --> 29:25.851
Champ and I are ready
to go in when needed.

29:25.894 --> 29:27.069
You know active-shooter
protocol?

29:27.113 --> 29:28.331
You're my backup, then.

29:28.375 --> 29:30.899
We're heading to the second
floor, room 208.

29:30.943 --> 29:32.205
Let's go.

29:37.427 --> 29:38.820
Somebody's in there.

29:38.864 --> 29:39.952
What is it, Champ?

29:43.825 --> 29:46.045
It's okay. It's okay.
We're cops.

29:46.088 --> 29:48.221
Come on.
Downstairs,
straight out the door.

29:50.963 --> 29:52.616
Roger that, Hondo.

29:52.660 --> 29:54.836
We're heading south down
the hall in the B building

29:54.880 --> 29:56.142
looking for shooter number two.

30:02.104 --> 30:03.453
Cross fire!
Cross fire!

30:08.589 --> 30:11.461
Lila, I need you stay real quiet

30:11.505 --> 30:13.637
and get as low as you can, okay?

30:25.998 --> 30:27.477
JESSICA : Students
are making their way to the gym

30:27.521 --> 30:29.653
on the south end of campus.

30:29.697 --> 30:31.307
Head there as soon as
you get in.

30:41.491 --> 30:43.058
The Civic parked illegally.

30:43.102 --> 30:44.625
That's Vince's car.Let's clear it.

30:51.327 --> 30:53.112
It's clear.

30:53.155 --> 30:55.679
HONDO: He's already on campus.
Let's move.

31:25.971 --> 31:27.973
RESOURCE OFFICER: Let's go,
let's go. Move, move, move.

31:28.016 --> 31:29.931
Stay low. Stay low.
CULLEN:
It's gonna be okay.

31:29.975 --> 31:33.282
Sit down when you
get in there. Sit down.

31:37.678 --> 31:39.114
Stay low. Let's go.Sit down when you
get in there.

31:39.158 --> 31:40.724
Let's go, come on.

31:40.768 --> 31:44.293
Todd, stay with the group.
I got the front door.

31:52.867 --> 31:55.522
Luca, right side.

31:55.565 --> 31:56.523
Oh!

31:56.566 --> 31:58.873
Don't move! Drop your weapon!

31:58.917 --> 31:59.874
I got visual. He's armed.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.006
Come out, show us your hands!

32:04.313 --> 32:05.836
Get down!

32:07.664 --> 32:08.970
Street, you good?Yeah.

32:09.014 --> 32:10.972
He's on the move! Deacon.

32:11.016 --> 32:12.365
I'm gonna draw his attention.

32:12.408 --> 32:13.888
Flank him from the other side.Roger that.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.020
Let's go.
Move.

32:16.586 --> 32:18.110
Shh, everybody.

32:24.551 --> 32:27.075
LUCA:
He's in front of the gym.

32:29.860 --> 32:32.689
HONDO: Vince!
We're here to help you, kid!

32:32.733 --> 32:33.952
Drop your gun!

32:33.995 --> 32:35.736
You don't want to
die here today!

32:35.779 --> 32:38.826
Think about your sister!
She's alone now, man!

32:38.869 --> 32:40.784
I'm-a try to draw him away.
Cover me.LUCA: Okay.

32:40.828 --> 32:42.873
Roger that.

32:50.055 --> 32:51.534
Put down the weapon, Vince!

33:03.546 --> 33:05.113
Ah!

33:06.158 --> 33:08.160
Stop moving!

33:08.203 --> 33:10.858
Got a gun!Hold him!
Go hands-on!

33:10.901 --> 33:12.860
VINCE: Get off me!LUCA: Hey, stop resisting!

33:26.526 --> 33:28.049
LUCA: Give me
your other hand!

33:28.093 --> 33:29.877
Don't move!

33:31.574 --> 33:33.576
Shooter number two
is in custody!

33:36.623 --> 33:38.668
Someone's in there.

33:38.712 --> 33:40.322
Get up. On your ass. Go!

33:40.366 --> 33:42.846
Hey. Open the door. It's LAPD.

33:42.890 --> 33:44.718
You're safe. It's over.

33:46.111 --> 33:47.764
KENZIE: How do we know
you're the police?

33:47.808 --> 33:50.028
Lila, it's me.
It's me, you can trust me.

33:50.071 --> 33:52.073
It's Officer Kay. Open the door.

33:52.117 --> 33:54.336
KENZIE: You
could be lying.

34:00.647 --> 34:03.084
Here, I'm gonna slide my badge
under the door, okay?

34:03.128 --> 34:04.781
That way, you know it's me.

34:12.311 --> 34:14.139
Lila.

34:14.182 --> 34:16.837
No, I'm-I'm Kenzie. That's Lila.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.926
S-She needs help. Sh...

34:18.969 --> 34:22.016
S-She stood in front of the door
to stop him from getting in,

34:22.060 --> 34:23.452
but he shot through it.

34:23.496 --> 34:25.106
I need a medic!

34:25.150 --> 34:27.152
I got you.

35:01.664 --> 35:04.102
Such a tragedy.

35:07.235 --> 35:10.717
Yeah. But your team
held strong, Buck.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.153
They're well trained.

35:12.197 --> 35:14.155
Thank you, sir.

35:14.199 --> 35:16.375
Finished our second sweep, sir.

35:16.418 --> 35:18.290
Some smoke bomb residue,
but no signs of explosives

35:18.333 --> 35:20.161
or bomb-making material
anywhere.

35:20.205 --> 35:22.468
Officer Alonso.

35:22.511 --> 35:24.948
You showed a lot of courage
going in there the way you did.

35:24.992 --> 35:27.125
This is Sergeant
Buck Spivey.

35:27.168 --> 35:28.735
It's nice to meet you.

35:28.778 --> 35:30.476
Sorry it's under
these circumstances.

35:30.519 --> 35:34.262
Likewise, sir.
Um, just out of curiosity,

35:34.306 --> 35:36.656
there aren't any women
on SWAT, are there?

35:36.699 --> 35:41.051
No. There's no rule against it,
it just hasn't happened yet.

35:41.095 --> 35:43.489
Good to know.

35:43.532 --> 35:46.274
Nice meeting you.

35:48.581 --> 35:50.409
So how many dead?

35:50.452 --> 35:52.585
Six.

35:52.628 --> 35:55.631
How old were they?

35:57.981 --> 36:00.375
Youngest was 14.

36:18.611 --> 36:21.266
If not for the grace of God.

36:21.309 --> 36:23.877
Today could've been really bad.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.575
Even worse than six years ago.

36:28.273 --> 36:29.796
STREET: I just
wanted to say,

36:29.839 --> 36:33.365
I get that seeing that guy
in the prison today

36:33.408 --> 36:35.236
would've been so rough for you.

36:35.280 --> 36:38.631
And I get that you wish
he'd just died before.

36:38.674 --> 36:41.242
But if he had, and if you
hadn't taken him alive,

36:41.286 --> 36:43.331
we might not have
stopped today's attack.

36:43.375 --> 36:46.029
Yeah.

36:53.689 --> 36:56.170
Do you mind?

36:56.214 --> 36:58.477
I used to have one
before we retired him.

36:58.520 --> 36:59.478
Course, go ahead.

37:07.964 --> 37:09.662
You're Chris Alonso, right?

37:10.750 --> 37:12.491
We know each other?

37:12.534 --> 37:16.234
No, but I know who you are.
We all do, ma'am.

37:28.594 --> 37:32.075
I'm Commander Robert Hicks
with the LAPD.

37:32.119 --> 37:33.947
Today, we responded
to a threat at the school,

37:33.990 --> 37:36.428
which we've addressed
and were able to prevent.

37:36.471 --> 37:37.951
When can we see our kids?So someone had a gun?

37:37.994 --> 37:40.649
The armed suspect has been taken
into custody

37:40.693 --> 37:45.437
with no student or faculty
casualties on site.

37:45.480 --> 37:48.570
Now, we're directing all family
members to stay in this area.

37:48.614 --> 37:50.616
We'll be bringing your
kids over to you in groups

37:50.659 --> 37:52.487
after we finish talking
with them.

37:52.531 --> 37:57.318
So just hold tight,
and thank you for your patience.

37:57.362 --> 37:58.798
Wait, so-so no one was hurt?

37:58.841 --> 38:02.410
No. No one. Everyone's safe.

38:02.454 --> 38:04.151
Thank you.

38:08.721 --> 38:11.332
Did Vince kill his mom because
of me? Because of what we wrote?

38:11.376 --> 38:12.594
Absolutely not.

38:12.638 --> 38:13.813
No.

38:13.856 --> 38:15.162
I know you've been
through hell and back,

38:15.205 --> 38:16.859
and a lot of parents
in your position,

38:16.903 --> 38:18.296
they would've hidden
from the world.

38:18.339 --> 38:19.949
I mean, I know
I might've.

38:19.993 --> 38:22.430
But because you brought us
that letter, it saved lives.

38:22.474 --> 38:24.998
A lot of lives. Thank you.

38:25.041 --> 38:27.783
You said you wanted
to talk to him.

38:27.827 --> 38:30.830
Now's your chance.

38:33.572 --> 38:37.184
Sergeant Harrelson?

38:41.406 --> 38:43.364
For two years after River Hill,

38:43.408 --> 38:46.062
I researched everything I
could to try and understand

38:46.106 --> 38:48.326
why my son did what he did.

38:48.369 --> 38:50.980
I went through all the public
records, the court filings,

38:51.024 --> 38:52.895
and that's where I came across

38:52.939 --> 38:54.375
the name
Sergeant Daniel Harrelson.

38:54.419 --> 38:56.116
Ms. Mogavero...

38:56.159 --> 38:58.118
No.

38:58.161 --> 39:00.512
I know you were the one
who killed my son.

39:02.296 --> 39:05.865
At first, I harbored
a lot of resentment,

39:05.908 --> 39:09.912
but over the years,
I've come to terms with it,

39:09.956 --> 39:12.219
that you did
what was necessary.

39:12.262 --> 39:16.136
I really wish it would have
all happened very differently.

39:18.486 --> 39:22.142
You're the reason why there
weren't more than seven victims.

39:44.207 --> 39:45.948
Anybody home?

39:45.992 --> 39:47.428
In here, Daddy.

39:49.996 --> 39:52.825
Wha...? I could've sworn
I heard somebody in here.

39:54.087 --> 39:56.655
Hmm.

39:58.004 --> 40:00.789
Has anybody seen Lila?

40:00.833 --> 40:02.791
Huh.

40:02.835 --> 40:04.967
Oh, well.

40:05.011 --> 40:08.057
I guess I'm gonna have to go say
good night to Matthew instead.

40:08.101 --> 40:10.059
No, Daddy, I'm right here.
What?

40:10.103 --> 40:11.887
You were there the whole time?

40:13.628 --> 40:15.238
All right. You ready for bed?

40:15.282 --> 40:17.240
Yeah? Did you brush your
face and wash your teeth?

40:18.894 --> 40:21.810
Okay. There you go.

40:21.854 --> 40:24.378
So what book are we reading?

40:24.422 --> 40:26.946
Tell me a story.A bedtime story?

40:28.034 --> 40:30.297
Okay.

40:32.952 --> 40:37.173
Did I ever told the story
of where you got your name?

40:39.175 --> 40:44.746
Well, I once knew
a little girl named Lila,

40:44.790 --> 40:47.140
and just like you,

40:47.183 --> 40:50.970
she loved science, school.

40:51.013 --> 40:53.929
She had lots
of friends.

40:53.973 --> 40:57.498
And one day,

40:57.542 --> 41:02.808
she helped Daddy save
a whole lot of people's lives

41:02.851 --> 41:05.463
right before you were born.

41:05.506 --> 41:08.204
Can I meet her?

41:09.467 --> 41:11.164
No.

41:11.207 --> 41:15.342
No, she's... she's in heaven.

41:15.385 --> 41:18.780
With Aunt Cathleen
and baby Jesus?

41:18.824 --> 41:23.176
That's right.

41:23.219 --> 41:26.309
Doesn't that make
her parents sad?

41:26.353 --> 41:29.530
I'm sure it does.

41:29.574 --> 41:31.532
Really,

41:31.576 --> 41:35.667
really sad.

41:35.710 --> 41:38.452
Maybe I should draw them
a picture

41:38.496 --> 41:40.454
to help them feel better.

41:41.716 --> 41:44.850
I think they'd love that.

41:50.986 --> 41:53.336
Every child has the right
to feel safe.

41:53.380 --> 41:55.513
It's up to all of us
to help end school violence.

41:55.556 --> 41:57.210
In 80% of school shootings,

41:57.253 --> 41:58.646
at least one other person knew

41:58.690 --> 42:00.648
about the attacker's plan
in advance.

42:00.692 --> 42:03.303
And 93% of the time,
school shooters will engage

42:03.346 --> 42:05.784
in troubling behavior
long before they attack.

42:05.827 --> 42:07.220
If you're a parent,
stay involved

42:07.263 --> 42:08.961
in your children's lives,
seek early help

42:09.004 --> 42:11.050
from school administrators,
or if necessary,

42:11.093 --> 42:12.791
from local law enforcement.

42:12.834 --> 42:14.488
If you're a student,
show your classmates kindness

42:14.532 --> 42:16.011
whenever you can.

42:16.055 --> 42:18.492
Oftentimes, the kids least
likely to ask for help

42:18.536 --> 42:20.320
are the ones
who need it the most.

42:20.363 --> 42:22.801
And don't be afraid to go to an
adult if you suspect something.

42:22.844 --> 42:25.804
You can be the generation
that ends school violence.

42:25.847 --> 42:28.589
