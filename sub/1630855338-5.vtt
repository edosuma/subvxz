00:40.082 --> 00:41.542
<i>Previously...</i>

00:41.542 --> 00:43.377
General Schuyler desperately
needs soldiers

00:43.377 --> 00:44.628
up at Fort Ticonderoga.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.547
I'm afraid my wife and I have business

00:46.547 --> 00:48.841
of a personal nature
to attend to in Scotland.

00:48.966 --> 00:50.593
Perhaps your business can wait.

00:50.593 --> 00:52.470
I wasn't prepared to join a war tonight.

00:52.470 --> 00:54.638
- I won't let you go without me.
- I'm comin' with ye too.

00:54.764 --> 00:56.974
<i>He had a child
wi' his Mohawk wife.</i>

00:56.974 --> 00:58.809
<i>If his spirit is
not strong enough,</i>

00:58.809 --> 01:00.895
<i>the child cannot take root in the womb.</i>

01:00.895 --> 01:02.271
Are you Denzell Hunter?

01:02.271 --> 01:03.397
Yer neighbor said ye were a physician?

01:03.397 --> 01:04.273
I am.

01:04.815 --> 01:06.734
This is William Ransom. He's been injured.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.360
<i>It seems he's overcome
the worst of his fever.</i>

01:08.486 --> 01:09.570
Will you tell him goodbye for me?

01:09.695 --> 01:10.946
<i>And give him this too.</i>

01:11.447 --> 01:14.241
It was a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Miss Hunter.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.535
I'm applying for
the plant inspector position.

01:16.535 --> 01:18.662
That environment's not suitable
for a female.

01:18.662 --> 01:19.997
Where are all the biscuits and crisps?

01:20.122 --> 01:21.499
It was the Nuckelavee.

01:21.499 --> 01:23.459
A folktale from the Northern Isles.

01:23.459 --> 01:25.044
I met one. The Nuckelavee is real.

03:24.121 --> 03:24.997
Jem, Mandy.

03:25.623 --> 03:26.498
Mama.

03:27.666 --> 03:28.626
What are you two doing?

03:29.960 --> 03:31.629
You know you're not supposed to be here.

03:31.629 --> 03:33.547
I told you not to play in the graveyard.

03:34.006 --> 03:36.091
I know, but we wanted
to play hide and seek.

03:38.594 --> 03:40.262
And Mandy wanted to talk to Grandda.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.350
And why is this a good place to do it?

03:44.934 --> 03:46.268
Well, he's here, isn't he?

03:48.729 --> 03:49.730
I-I-I-I don't know.

03:51.607 --> 03:52.691
I suppose he could be.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.197
You haven't found Grandda's grave,

03:58.197 --> 03:59.073
have you, Jem?

03:59.406 --> 04:00.199
No.

04:00.783 --> 04:02.493
But he said if I ever came here,

04:02.493 --> 04:04.203
I should leave him a stone, so I did.

04:05.037 --> 04:06.121
I built him a cairn.

04:07.331 --> 04:08.207
Come see.

04:09.375 --> 04:10.250
Not today, Jem.

04:11.669 --> 04:12.544
Let's go home.

04:13.545 --> 04:14.421
Mandy, come on, sweetheart.

04:14.421 --> 04:15.297
You too.

04:34.692 --> 04:35.818
<i>Brianna!</i>

04:37.152 --> 04:38.028
I'm in here.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.580
Apparently the kids go
to the graveyard all the time.

04:48.956 --> 04:49.915
Oh, sweetheart.

04:57.381 --> 04:59.633
<i>And no, I didn't see Mama
and Da's headstones.</i>

05:00.092 --> 05:01.176
And I never want to.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.847
But the kids go there to visit Da.

05:06.181 --> 05:07.391
Jemmy said he was there.

05:07.933 --> 05:08.851
Oh, Bree. I'm sorry.

05:13.397 --> 05:14.273
I'll talk to him.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.026
He's just...

05:18.193 --> 05:19.319
making stuff up again,

05:20.320 --> 05:21.530
<i>like the Nuckelavee.</i>

05:23.449 --> 05:24.700
But it is possible though

05:25.409 --> 05:27.703
that Mama and Da might've
been buried here.

05:29.204 --> 05:32.166
Your parents did say they came
to Scotland in their letters.

05:35.461 --> 05:38.088
I know we said we'd wait
to read another one, but...

05:39.882 --> 05:41.508
I was just missing them.

05:43.886 --> 05:44.762
Hey.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.557
We've waited long enough.

05:50.142 --> 05:51.018
Okay.

05:54.730 --> 05:55.606
- Thank you.
- Mm.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.202
<i>"June 18, 1777,</i>

06:10.037 --> 06:11.163
Fort Ticonderoga."

06:12.456 --> 06:14.166
What on earth are they doing there?

06:15.167 --> 06:16.251
<i>"Dear Bree,</i>

06:16.835 --> 06:18.462
<i>"as you've doubtless gathered
from the heading</i>

06:18.462 --> 06:20.589
<i>"of this letter,
we are not yet in Scotland.</i>

06:21.965 --> 06:23.842
<i>"Your father was conscripted into service</i>

06:23.842 --> 06:25.260
<i>"with the Continental Army.</i>

06:26.386 --> 06:28.472
<i>"We've been stationed at Fort Ticonderoga</i>

06:28.472 --> 06:29.723
<i>"for the past few months.</i>

06:31.350 --> 06:33.852
<i>"Jamie commands a crew of men
we met on the ship over</i>

06:34.311 --> 06:36.605
<i>"who call themselves
'Fraser's Irregulars.'</i>

06:37.648 --> 06:39.566
<i>And as you can imagine,
your father likes that."</i>

06:42.277 --> 06:43.904
<i>"They're building redoubts
to help protect the fort</i>

06:43.904 --> 06:44.863
<i>"in case of attack.</i>

06:46.573 --> 06:49.159
<i>"Meanwhile, I've been helping
the sick and injured</i>

06:49.159 --> 06:50.786
<i>"under one Lieutenant Stactoe,</i>

06:52.121 --> 06:54.289
<i>"a man who thinks he's a surgeon but isn't</i>

06:54.289 --> 06:56.500
<i>"and thinks that I am not
because I am a woman.</i>

06:59.378 --> 07:02.089
<i>"Ian joined us again, having
made his way north by land,</i>

07:02.506 --> 07:04.925
<i>"gathering information
from the Indian tribes.</i>

07:06.051 --> 07:08.095
<i>"Meanwhile, the British Army
are approaching us</i>

07:08.095 --> 07:10.305
<i>"from the north,
but Major General St. Clair</i>

07:11.306 --> 07:12.975
<i>is confident the fort will hold."</i>

07:13.725 --> 07:15.561
<i>"We'll stay and help the cause</i>

07:15.561 --> 07:17.271
<i>"until your father is released

07:17.271 --> 07:18.272
"on the 10th of July.

"He dreams of the children now and then.

07:23.152 --> 07:24.820
"I think of them every single day.

07:27.072 --> 07:28.157
"We send all our love.

07:29.741 --> 07:30.617
Mama."

07:34.830 --> 07:37.249
I know Fort Ticonderoga;
my father took me there.

07:37.749 --> 07:38.625
Aye.

07:39.710 --> 07:41.879
We could always scour the history books,

07:43.380 --> 07:44.965
see if there's any mention of them.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.466
<i>Not that one.</i>

07:48.343 --> 07:49.970
Maybe it's better we don't know.

08:05.611 --> 08:06.904
<i>Colonel Fraser,</i>

08:06.904 --> 08:09.156
what progress has been made
on the defenses?

08:09.865 --> 08:12.367
Construction should be complete
within a fortnight, sir.

08:12.367 --> 08:13.243
Excellent.

08:13.869 --> 08:14.912
Colonel Kosciuszko?

08:16.079 --> 08:16.830
General Fermoy...

08:18.749 --> 08:19.541
if I may.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.839
I believe we are vulnerable to attack

08:27.591 --> 08:28.717
from Sugar Loaf Hill.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.427
I-if the British should take it,

08:30.552 --> 08:32.804
and I have reason
to believe they will try,

08:33.222 --> 08:35.015
they will have the higher ground.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.809
We should station men here,
on Sugar Loaf, immediately.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.355
I cannot believe they'd be foolish enough

08:41.355 --> 08:42.564
to attempt such a thing.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.484
The terrain is too treacherous
and too steep

08:45.484 --> 08:46.610
for soldiers to scale.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.446
If there are Highlanders among them--

08:49.446 --> 08:51.240
Yes, Highlanders.

08:51.615 --> 08:52.366
Or goats.

08:56.912 --> 08:58.705
Where a goat can go, a man can go, sir.

09:00.499 --> 09:02.417
And where a man can go, he can drag a gun.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.169
Cannon fire will reach us.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.880
No man could drag a cannon to that summit,

09:07.339 --> 09:08.674
Highlander or otherwise.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.635
<i>General St. Clair would agree with me.</i>

09:12.594 --> 09:14.721
I assure you,
Burgoyne will not dare attack

09:15.347 --> 09:16.640
from a mountain across the water.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.058
Wi' all due respect, sir--

09:18.058 --> 09:19.851
You are dismissed, Colonel Fraser.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.566
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Hunter.</i>

09:26.566 --> 09:27.859
<i>You say you do not believe in violence</i>

09:27.859 --> 09:28.819
<i>of any kind and yet,</i>

09:29.653 --> 09:31.530
by your own admission, there you were,

09:31.530 --> 09:32.614
chopping up corpses.

09:33.282 --> 09:35.075
For medical purposes.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.994
I'd hardly call it "violence" as such.

09:37.661 --> 09:39.955
There is only so much
to be learned from texts.

09:39.955 --> 09:41.039
And where is it you get these

09:41.039 --> 09:42.499
unfortunate specimens, eh?

09:44.167 --> 09:46.003
They are executed criminals, but--

09:46.420 --> 09:49.256
But you call me a brute
for thinking we are better off

09:49.256 --> 09:51.216
without such villains living among us.

09:51.550 --> 09:52.551
<i>Dispatch 'em, I say.</i>

09:53.510 --> 09:54.928
Does thee not believe it is a sin

09:54.928 --> 09:56.179
to take someone's life, William?

09:56.305 --> 09:57.556
The life of a murderer?

09:58.473 --> 09:59.349
No.

09:59.891 --> 10:00.684
I call it justice.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.686
<i>But an army surgeon...</i>

10:03.103 --> 10:06.023
I simply cannot fathom why
you did not choose a more...

10:06.023 --> 10:08.317
a more peaceable profession, Mr. Hunter.

10:08.317 --> 10:10.193
Well, when our parents died,

10:10.193 --> 10:11.820
a relative of mine arranged for me

10:11.820 --> 10:13.905
to attend a medical college in London.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.615
I believe it is a noble profession

10:15.615 --> 10:16.950
and one that suits me well.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.246
But say a crime were committed

10:22.289 --> 10:24.291
<i>against your lovely sister, Mr. Hunter,</i>

10:24.416 --> 10:26.501
or against your brother, Miss Hunter.

10:27.252 --> 10:28.879
You would hold fast to your principles?

10:29.004 --> 10:30.881
We rely upon God's judgment alone.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.635
Or the willingness of others
to commit violence for you.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.597
I think we shall have to agree
to disagree on this matter.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.849
We Quakers cannot be shaken
from our beliefs.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.560
We tremble only before God and His word.

10:46.855 --> 10:47.773
Look there.

10:52.944 --> 10:54.613
Well met, all.

10:54.613 --> 10:55.572
Where're ye bound?

10:56.073 --> 10:57.366
Towards Albany.

10:57.366 --> 10:58.992
Ah, ye're on the wrong road, sir.

10:59.743 --> 11:00.994
Are you certain?

11:00.994 --> 11:02.496
We were told this was the best route.

11:02.496 --> 11:03.705
<i>I am certain.</i>

11:04.039 --> 11:06.416
<i>You ought to've gone left
at the crossroads, sir.</i>

11:06.416 --> 11:08.585
It's several hours ride back
to the crossroads.

11:09.544 --> 11:11.963
<i>Should we make camp
here for the night?</i>

11:13.757 --> 11:15.634
<i>Why don't you come
back to my house?</i>

11:15.634 --> 11:18.261
My wife would be pleased
to offer you supper and a bed.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.097
That's quite generous of you.

11:28.730 --> 11:29.981
I hope you have not gone
to too much trouble

11:29.981 --> 11:30.816
on our account.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.402
We don't often have guests.

11:33.402 --> 11:34.277
Please, eat.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.700
<i>We lived in abundance on this farm</i>

11:41.284 --> 11:43.203
<i>before the army started marching through.</i>

11:43.787 --> 11:44.704
Thriving, we were

11:46.123 --> 11:48.625
before they started taking
our crops, our horses,

11:49.709 --> 11:51.044
the very clothes off our backs.

11:55.298 --> 11:56.133
Which army was it?

11:57.634 --> 11:58.510
Both of 'em.

12:01.346 --> 12:02.472
I'm sorry to hear it.

12:02.931 --> 12:03.849
Aye.

12:08.854 --> 12:10.105
Aren't you hungry, love?

12:10.897 --> 12:12.065
You haven't touched your food.

12:16.987 --> 12:17.988
Uh, I beg thy pardon.

12:18.655 --> 12:19.781
I think I must take some air.

12:36.214 --> 12:37.424
Miss Hunter.

12:39.509 --> 12:40.302
Are you well?

12:41.178 --> 12:43.847
I needed to remove myself
from the stench of that stew.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.557
- Didst thou see--
- No.

12:45.891 --> 12:47.350
And I shall be a good deal happier

12:47.350 --> 12:48.435
if you do not tell me.

12:52.564 --> 12:54.232
I suppose we should be grateful

12:54.232 --> 12:56.610
that the Johnsons could spare
us any food at all,

12:56.985 --> 12:58.528
given their humble circumstances.

12:59.738 --> 13:00.989
You're right, of course.

13:01.615 --> 13:02.657
We will leave at dawn.

13:04.326 --> 13:05.535
This sounds agreeable.

13:08.038 --> 13:09.956
And if they are kind enough
to offer us breakfast

13:09.956 --> 13:12.584
in the morning, our answer
will be a resounding "No."

13:24.137 --> 13:26.431
Have a great day at work
and leave the rest to me.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.684
Not to worry.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.687
I have everything under control.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.317
Oh, and bring your hard hat home with you.

13:37.901 --> 13:38.777
Why?

13:40.612 --> 13:42.280
I thought you could wear it to bed.

13:42.739 --> 13:43.615
Oh.

13:44.741 --> 13:45.534
I can do that.

13:47.410 --> 13:49.538
Ah, I would say
"without your knickers on,"

13:50.247 --> 13:51.790
but you don't seem to be wearing any.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.208
Mm-mm.

13:53.792 --> 13:55.335
Just something new I'm trying.

13:56.294 --> 13:56.962
- Huh.
- Or old.

13:58.755 --> 14:01.258
Got so used to not wearing them
in the 18th century,

14:01.883 --> 14:03.468
just sort of feels weird now.

14:03.468 --> 14:04.970
Well, that's a shame.

14:05.554 --> 14:06.972
I like you in your knickers.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.557
You like taking them off.

14:11.059 --> 14:11.935
Mm.

14:16.815 --> 14:18.441
<i>Hello.</i>

14:23.405 --> 14:24.823
All right, sweetheart.

14:24.823 --> 14:25.949
Mommy's gotta go to work.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.201
Will you be good for Daddy?

14:28.201 --> 14:29.160
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

14:29.286 --> 14:30.537
Come here, baby. Mwah.

14:31.121 --> 14:31.997
Bye.

14:33.164 --> 14:34.249
No mischief, you two.

14:34.624 --> 14:35.500
Mischief? Us?

14:59.065 --> 15:00.817
- Mike, Mike.
- Morning, sir.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.527
Up here's the turbine room.

15:02.527 --> 15:03.987
You'll have seen one of these before.

15:03.987 --> 15:04.863
Yep.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.365
Apologies for the noise.

15:07.365 --> 15:09.159
They're replacing a turbine today.

15:09.826 --> 15:10.744
We're in this one.

15:49.407 --> 15:50.283
Oh.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.869
You'll need these to get around.

15:52.869 --> 15:53.745
Oh, thanks.

15:56.164 --> 15:57.832
Maintenance and Repairs.

16:04.714 --> 16:07.175
This is Mrs. MacKenzie,
your new plant inspector.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.886
<i>She's already familiar
with the tunnel schematics,</i>

16:09.886 --> 16:12.013
<i>but she could do with
a tour of the grounds.</i>

16:12.013 --> 16:14.015
Introduce yourselves
and get her up to speed.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.017
Good luck.

16:24.526 --> 16:25.985
I hear you're replacing a rudder blade

16:25.985 --> 16:27.654
on one of the turbines today.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.489
Can someone take me to the valve room?

16:29.489 --> 16:30.448
That's my project.

16:31.783 --> 16:32.409
I'll take you.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.870
Thanks. I appreciate it, Mr...

16:36.705 --> 16:37.622
Cameron.

16:38.289 --> 16:39.165
Rob Cameron.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.543
And this is two of my crew, Craig Dowd

16:42.085 --> 16:43.044
<i>Andy Pfeiffer.</i>

16:43.878 --> 16:45.797
Ah, nice to meet you, Madam Inspector.

16:48.299 --> 16:49.175
Aye, charmed.

16:49.676 --> 16:50.635
Right, come on then.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.178
<i>Got a busy day ahead of us.</i>

16:52.721 --> 16:54.723
And a pint at the Ryeland
waiting for us tonight.

16:54.723 --> 16:55.598
Every night.

17:06.276 --> 17:08.319
Oh, the door's open.
You pass me your keys,

17:08.319 --> 17:09.779
I'll show you which one
unlocks it for the future.

17:09.779 --> 17:10.864
Oh, great.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.576
Ladies first.

17:15.118 --> 17:16.661
You can take my torch if you want.

17:16.661 --> 17:17.537
Thanks.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.170
Hello?

17:30.800 --> 17:31.926
All right, very funny.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.429
<i>Good luck, Madam Inspector.</i>

17:34.554 --> 17:36.139
We'll leave your keys on your desk!

17:36.514 --> 17:37.348
Go, go, go, go!

17:38.892 --> 17:40.268
Hey!

17:45.231 --> 17:46.483
Really?

18:23.311 --> 18:24.270
Come on.

18:32.153 --> 18:33.112
Bastards.

19:10.066 --> 19:10.984
Oh, shit.

19:11.401 --> 19:12.277
Left or right?

19:17.156 --> 19:18.074
Right.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.738
Is that understood?

20:38.738 --> 20:40.865
- You sent for me, sir?
- Ah.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.743
General St. Clair was told
you speak Mohawk

20:43.743 --> 20:44.786
and lived among them for a time.

20:44.911 --> 20:45.745
Aye.

20:46.496 --> 20:48.247
He trusts you're familiar
with Joseph Brant,

20:48.247 --> 20:49.499
known as Thayendanegea.

20:50.458 --> 20:51.250
I am.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.170
The British have promised land

20:54.170 --> 20:56.172
to the Mohawk in return
for an alliance with them.

20:56.172 --> 20:58.841
We, of course,
would prefer they supported us.

20:58.967 --> 21:00.593
The general received word Brant is staying

21:00.593 --> 21:02.095
<i>in the village of Shadow Lake.</i>

21:03.137 --> 21:04.722
You're to deliver a letter,

21:04.722 --> 21:06.057
<i>which will contain within it important--</i>

21:06.057 --> 21:07.141
I know of the village,

21:07.558 --> 21:08.935
<i>but respectfully, sir,</i>

21:10.603 --> 21:11.729
uh, can you kindly ask the general

21:11.729 --> 21:12.647
to send another scout?

21:13.189 --> 21:14.107
Why is that?

21:14.816 --> 21:16.484
There are personal reasons, sir.

21:18.736 --> 21:20.238
Unfortunately, Mr. Murray,

21:20.238 --> 21:22.365
war does not allow for personal reasons.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.867
<i>The general requires that you leave today.</i>

21:25.618 --> 21:26.494
That's an order.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.220
Auntie, can I speak to ye?

21:46.305 --> 21:47.557
I-I ken ye're busy, but--

21:47.932 --> 21:48.891
No, of course.

21:52.520 --> 21:53.396
Bairns.

21:54.022 --> 21:55.940
I'm-I'm wonderin' how they come to be.

21:58.860 --> 21:59.736
Ian, I...

22:00.945 --> 22:03.865
I refuse to believe that you
don't know how babies are made.

22:04.198 --> 22:05.116
I want to know why.

22:12.373 --> 22:13.249
What went wrong?

22:16.753 --> 22:19.047
You mean
with the child that you lost?

22:21.340 --> 22:22.216
Aye.

22:22.759 --> 22:23.634
Iseabail.

22:25.303 --> 22:26.220
What's wrong with me?

22:27.096 --> 22:29.432
Why do you think anything's
wrong with you?

22:29.432 --> 22:31.142
Emily's grandmother, Tsotehweh,

22:33.269 --> 22:34.645
believed that to conceive,

22:35.104 --> 22:37.190
a-a man's spirit must overcome a woman's.

22:40.943 --> 22:42.779
Emily has a child now with Kaheroton.

22:46.908 --> 22:48.701
Well, his spirit was strong enough,

22:49.285 --> 22:50.244
but mine wasna?

22:53.664 --> 22:55.750
I could... I could never take another wife

22:56.918 --> 22:58.628
if I kent I'd never give her bairns.

23:01.339 --> 23:03.132
Uncle Jamie told me about the, uh...

23:05.468 --> 23:06.344
the-the sperm?

23:09.347 --> 23:11.974
I wondered if there might be
something wrong with mine.

23:12.642 --> 23:14.185
Could-could ye maybe... look?

23:16.562 --> 23:18.481
Oh, Ian, I don't think that would help.

23:20.608 --> 23:22.527
Well, and I would need a microscope.

23:27.490 --> 23:29.033
Did you ever see your daughter?

23:32.870 --> 23:34.247
She was wrapped up on the...

23:35.164 --> 23:37.250
on the cradleboard for the funeral.

23:37.250 --> 23:38.126
I...

23:39.544 --> 23:40.545
I didn't have a chance.

23:44.132 --> 23:45.216
Did Emily ever say...

23:48.886 --> 23:51.806
did she ever say there was
anything wrong with the child?

23:51.806 --> 23:53.182
Was she deformed in any way?

23:56.394 --> 23:57.770
Emily said Iseabail was...

24:01.816 --> 24:02.400
...perfect.

24:04.986 --> 24:05.903
The truth is, Ian,

24:07.446 --> 24:08.781
many women lose children,

24:11.826 --> 24:13.536
yeah, either through stillbirth,

24:16.789 --> 24:18.916
or miscarriages for any number of reasons.

24:22.837 --> 24:24.672
Yeah, actually it's quite common...

24:26.257 --> 24:27.967
though women seldom talk about it.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.220
Now I could list all
of the medical conditions

24:32.221 --> 24:33.973
that could've caused it, but...

24:36.225 --> 24:37.101
I can assure you,

24:39.103 --> 24:41.022
this has nothing to do with your spirit

24:42.023 --> 24:43.816
and everything to do with science.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.069
So ye're sayin' there...

24:48.571 --> 24:49.947
there's nothin' wrong with me?

24:50.656 --> 24:51.532
What I'm saying

24:52.533 --> 24:53.951
is that there's every chance

24:54.827 --> 24:57.747
you won't have a problem having
a child with another woman.

24:59.957 --> 25:01.042
Oh, thank ye, Auntie.

25:37.787 --> 25:39.914
Mr. Johnson, you couldn't sleep either?

25:44.001 --> 25:44.877
Denny, wake up!

25:50.549 --> 25:52.802
<i>Stop it! Leave my brother alone!</i>

25:52.802 --> 25:54.220
<i>Rachel, get back!</i>

25:56.472 --> 25:58.349
Stop, Mrs. Johnson.
What's wrong with you?

26:03.396 --> 26:04.605
<i>Rachel, grab her!</i>

26:06.023 --> 26:07.024
<i>Stop!</i>

26:09.318 --> 26:10.069
<i>Stop!</i>

26:23.207 --> 26:24.583
<i>William!</i>

26:50.609 --> 26:52.153
Thee saved our lives.

26:53.279 --> 26:54.780
I don't know how to thank thee.

26:56.407 --> 26:57.950
You can thank that rotten stew.

27:00.703 --> 27:02.413
Had I not awoken with such terrible pain

27:02.413 --> 27:03.289
in my stomach...

27:08.419 --> 27:09.503
Where is your brother?

27:10.212 --> 27:11.088
He's with wife.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.591
She confessed, but

27:14.759 --> 27:16.844
claims her husband forces her to help him.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.555
So they've done this before?

27:19.889 --> 27:21.891
She showed us a cupboard full of jewelry

27:22.016 --> 27:23.601
and other ill-gotten gains.

27:24.769 --> 27:27.188
She offered them to us
if we'll leave her in peace.

27:29.106 --> 27:30.483
We won't accept, of course.

27:32.485 --> 27:35.154
<i>How many victims
did they lure inside</i>

27:35.154 --> 27:37.198
and then butcher in their sleep, I wonder?

27:38.657 --> 27:39.909
She is begging for mercy.

27:43.913 --> 27:45.164
She has lost her husband.

27:46.582 --> 27:47.792
'Tis in God's hands now.

27:50.419 --> 27:51.921
Punishment enough, perhaps.

27:57.468 --> 27:58.344
What is it?

28:01.055 --> 28:01.931
William?

28:10.898 --> 28:12.566
I've never killed anyone before.

28:15.986 --> 28:16.862
I do not...

28:17.780 --> 28:19.698
I do not quite know what to do about it.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.035
I expected it to be in battle.

28:24.537 --> 28:26.747
I-I think I would know
how to feel if it had been.

28:26.747 --> 28:27.623
No.

28:28.624 --> 28:29.625
Thee wouldn't.

28:30.793 --> 28:32.336
You must think me disgraceful.

28:32.753 --> 28:35.005
I know thee well enough
to know that's untrue.

28:52.606 --> 28:53.482
Claire.

28:57.319 --> 28:59.155
Our scouts caught a British regular.

29:00.906 --> 29:03.868
He told us that Simon Fraser is
one of Burgoyne's brigadiers

29:04.201 --> 29:05.911
and has the forward command.

29:05.911 --> 29:06.996
- Simon Fraser?
- Aye.

29:07.997 --> 29:10.040
And not the Old Fox you met or his son,

29:10.040 --> 29:12.293
but a second cousin,
Simon Fraser of Balnain,

29:14.086 --> 29:15.087
verra bonny fighter.

29:15.087 --> 29:15.963
I don't doubt it.

29:16.672 --> 29:18.924
Worse, the British are running
short of food,

29:20.217 --> 29:21.177
horses.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.220
If they dinna have enough supplies,

29:23.220 --> 29:24.889
they'll no be able to surround us

29:24.889 --> 29:26.307
and wait for us to surrender.

29:26.682 --> 29:27.641
They'll need to...

29:28.642 --> 29:30.269
they'll need to take the fort by force.

29:31.353 --> 29:33.606
I think they'll put cannon
on Sugar Loaf Hill.

29:35.274 --> 29:36.984
Have you talked to General Fermoy?

29:38.068 --> 29:39.653
Fermoy's not particularly receptive

29:39.653 --> 29:41.280
to the concerns of his subordinates.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.907
He sounds like an arse.

29:44.950 --> 29:46.035
He's a very proud man.

29:46.785 --> 29:47.870
He insists they willna make it up there,

29:47.995 --> 29:49.872
but-but I ken how a Highlander thinks.

29:51.957 --> 29:52.791
If there's a higher ground to take,

29:52.791 --> 29:54.460
then Simon Fraser will find a way.

29:55.711 --> 29:57.421
Could you warn St. Clair directly?

29:57.838 --> 29:59.882
Fermoy has the general's ear,

30:00.007 --> 30:01.675
so it's Fermoy I must persuade.

30:02.676 --> 30:04.303
Wouldna be wise to go around him.

30:04.845 --> 30:06.347
It could be very bad for my men.

30:07.264 --> 30:09.725
But he's convinced
an attack will come by land,

30:09.725 --> 30:11.143
and not from across the water.

30:12.269 --> 30:14.438
It reminds me of the Battle of Singapore,

30:14.438 --> 30:15.564
though the other way around.

30:17.441 --> 30:19.944
In World War II, the British
were stationed there,

30:19.944 --> 30:22.238
and General Percival had
his guns aimed at the sea,

30:22.238 --> 30:23.906
convinced that the surrounding jungles

30:23.906 --> 30:26.033
were too dangerous and dense to penetrate.

30:27.243 --> 30:28.702
And he was proved to be wrong?

30:28.702 --> 30:31.163
The Japanese cut their way
through the jungles

30:31.163 --> 30:33.541
and attacked his defenses
at the weakest point,

30:33.916 --> 30:34.792
by land.

30:35.584 --> 30:36.710
And seeing is believing.

30:38.087 --> 30:40.089
Of course, by that point, it was too late.

30:43.092 --> 30:44.176
Seeing is believin'.

30:46.428 --> 30:47.638
You've given me an idea.

30:54.144 --> 30:55.771
This is where we part.

30:56.647 --> 30:58.274
Ticonderoga lies this direction.

30:59.775 --> 31:01.110
My way lies farther north.

31:01.735 --> 31:03.404
We thank thee for escorting us.

31:04.071 --> 31:05.197
Should any British troops

31:05.197 --> 31:06.282
or Hessians molest you,

31:07.491 --> 31:09.785
tell them that you demand
to see their officer

31:09.785 --> 31:11.203
and that you know his friend.

31:11.912 --> 31:14.123
And if they demand to know
the name of this friend,

31:14.123 --> 31:15.624
Harold Grey, Duke of Pardloe.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.127
And who is Harold?

31:20.838 --> 31:21.714
Some kin to me.

31:34.435 --> 31:36.103
I would like you to have the money.

31:41.025 --> 31:42.526
And I shall hold on to this.

31:43.319 --> 31:45.821
I thank thee, but we will do
well enough without it.

31:47.531 --> 31:48.407
I insist.

31:51.493 --> 31:52.369
Fare thee well.

32:02.963 --> 32:04.673
Thee knows he is a British soldier?

32:05.007 --> 32:05.966
Likely a deserter.

32:07.176 --> 32:08.052
And if he is?

32:08.510 --> 32:10.012
Violence follows such a man.

32:11.555 --> 32:13.349
Is thee not taking me to join an army?

32:14.350 --> 32:16.769
I think thee may be
a hypocrite, Denzell Hunter.

32:16.769 --> 32:17.645
Mm.

32:20.481 --> 32:22.608
Say the word and I'll find
thee a place with friends,

32:22.608 --> 32:24.109
where thee may stay in safety.

32:25.110 --> 32:26.236
The Lord spoke to me,

32:26.362 --> 32:28.155
and I must follow my conscience.

32:29.031 --> 32:31.241
But there is no need for thee
to follow it too.

32:32.368 --> 32:33.661
The Lord spoke to me as well.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.039
He said, "Keep thy
fat-headed brother from dying."

32:39.833 --> 32:41.585
If thee are going to join the army, Denny,

32:41.585 --> 32:42.670
let us go and find it.

33:21.625 --> 33:22.918
Wolf's Brother...

33:26.380 --> 33:29.633
My heart is warm to see you.

33:30.092 --> 33:31.844
Mine, too.

33:32.594 --> 33:33.679
What brings you here?

33:34.555 --> 33:37.433
Uh, my general sent
me to speak with Thayendanegea,

33:38.225 --> 33:39.643
<i>Joseph Brant, about the war.</i>

33:40.769 --> 33:42.146
Yes, he's staying at our village.

33:43.897 --> 33:45.441
But first, will ye walk with me?

33:47.776 --> 33:48.736
I...I can't go far.

33:51.572 --> 33:52.448
My son...

33:54.032 --> 33:55.367
<i>and daughter, newly born.</i>

33:59.747 --> 34:00.831
Yer family has grown.

34:04.293 --> 34:05.836
I wish to say to ye that I'm sorry

34:06.545 --> 34:08.172
that I could not give ye children

34:09.465 --> 34:11.550
and that... and that I'm glad
ye have them.

34:14.094 --> 34:15.471
Are ye happy, Wahionhaweh?

34:19.767 --> 34:20.642
I am.

34:25.773 --> 34:27.524
Ye dinna ask me whether I am happy.

34:29.151 --> 34:30.027
I have eyes.

34:37.910 --> 34:38.702
May I meet your son?

34:45.709 --> 34:48.128
Sweetheart, come here.

34:53.592 --> 34:54.468
Hmm.

35:01.642 --> 35:03.060
I must attend to my daughter.

35:16.073 --> 35:18.492
What's your name?

35:18.492 --> 35:21.954
Swiftest of Lizards.

35:23.372 --> 35:24.581
Are you Wolf's Brother?

35:26.416 --> 35:28.210
I am. Your mother taught ye English?

35:29.086 --> 35:30.587
Yes.

35:30.921 --> 35:32.673
My grandmother talks about you.

35:34.049 --> 35:34.716
What does she say?

35:35.384 --> 35:37.219
She says I'm the child of your spirit.

35:38.554 --> 35:40.389
- Does she?
- Yes.

35:40.389 --> 35:42.099
But I should not say so to my father.

35:57.030 --> 35:58.949
Will you choose a name for him...

36:00.617 --> 36:01.493
of your people?

36:06.123 --> 36:07.666
For when he walks in that world.

36:16.300 --> 36:17.175
Thank you.

36:26.059 --> 36:29.980
Your name is Ian James.

36:31.356 --> 36:32.816
- Ian James.
- Mm-hmm.

36:35.277 --> 36:36.403
I like it.

37:18.278 --> 37:19.112
Jemmy.

37:20.572 --> 37:21.531
It's not safe in here.

37:21.531 --> 37:22.157
Come on out.

37:23.700 --> 37:24.660
Come on.

38:01.697 --> 38:02.656
What's wrong, son?

38:04.366 --> 38:05.242
Ye can tell me.

38:08.245 --> 38:09.121
No.

38:11.707 --> 38:14.167
Well, why didn't you come up
to the house then?

38:14.167 --> 38:15.043
Huh?

38:15.627 --> 38:17.254
For Dad's regular teatime special:

38:17.379 --> 38:18.338
beans on toast?

38:23.093 --> 38:24.594
I... got in trouble at school.

38:31.059 --> 38:31.935
What for?

38:33.979 --> 38:36.690
Tommy Reid said me and Mama
and Mandy were all gonna burn

38:37.107 --> 38:38.066
in hell as papists.

38:40.193 --> 38:41.945
Well, you know what to say to that.

38:41.945 --> 38:42.946
"I'll see ye there."

38:43.989 --> 38:44.865
And I did,

38:46.116 --> 38:47.492
only I said it in the Gaelic.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.787
Miss Glendenning didn't like that.

38:51.538 --> 38:52.914
She grabbed me by the ear and said,

38:52.914 --> 38:54.875
"In this classroom, we speak English."

38:58.587 --> 38:59.463
She shook me, Da.

39:01.048 --> 39:02.007
And I cursed at her,

39:02.966 --> 39:04.217
one of Grandda's curses.

39:07.554 --> 39:09.056
So she called the headmaster,

39:11.683 --> 39:13.185
and he made me hold out my hands

39:13.185 --> 39:14.519
and gave me three with the belt.

39:16.688 --> 39:17.564
Am I in trouble?

39:20.650 --> 39:21.485
Come here, son.

39:23.570 --> 39:24.488
Ye're not mad?

39:26.740 --> 39:27.407
Not at you.

39:31.953 --> 39:33.371
Why is it bad to speak Gaelic?

39:36.249 --> 39:37.125
It's not.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.879
Dinna fash. We'll sort it out.

39:42.005 --> 39:42.881
I promise.

39:46.093 --> 39:46.718
Come on.

39:48.428 --> 39:49.763
And pick up your wrappers.

39:50.430 --> 39:52.641
Don't leave your rubbish out here anymore.

39:52.641 --> 39:53.850
It's not my rubbish, Da.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.534
You must try to get
some sleep, Mrs. Raven.

40:10.534 --> 40:11.701
You're overtired.

40:11.701 --> 40:13.120
How can I sleep,

40:13.662 --> 40:16.289
when any moment we may be
set upon by the British Army,

40:16.998 --> 40:17.958
or worse, Indians.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.712
I've heard they cut off pieces of you...

40:23.296 --> 40:25.006
fingers first, one joint at a time.

40:28.260 --> 40:31.263
I'll prepare some herbs that'll
help you settle your nerves,

40:31.847 --> 40:33.849
but you have to try and keep
these terrible thoughts

40:33.849 --> 40:34.724
out of your mind.

40:35.350 --> 40:36.226
How can I?

40:37.144 --> 40:38.812
My husband and son were killed.

40:43.608 --> 40:44.985
I'm so sorry.

40:44.985 --> 40:47.195
I-I'll get something
that'll help you rest.

40:48.280 --> 40:49.990
I'm in charge here, sir.

40:49.990 --> 40:52.492
We'll do this my way,
and we will cut below the knee,

40:53.451 --> 40:55.412
especially as the patient might lose--

40:56.830 --> 40:57.414
can I help you?

40:58.123 --> 40:59.207
Lieutenant Stactoe,

41:00.167 --> 41:01.626
I don't believe we've met.

41:02.085 --> 41:03.503
Denzell Hunter. And thee is?

41:03.962 --> 41:04.838
Mrs. Fraser.

41:05.380 --> 41:07.424
You may move along, madam.

41:07.424 --> 41:08.425
We've work to do.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.343
Please, is it true?

41:12.179 --> 41:14.181
They tell me it will need to be amputated.

41:19.269 --> 41:20.312
I'm afraid they're right.

41:21.897 --> 41:23.148
Your foot is gangrenous.

41:24.482 --> 41:25.358
I am sorry.

41:28.862 --> 41:30.071
What were you debating?

41:30.655 --> 41:32.782
Nothing for you to remark upon, certainly.

41:33.783 --> 41:36.286
We were discussing the degree
of amputation required.

41:36.411 --> 41:37.913
The good surgeon wishes
to cut below the knee

41:37.913 --> 41:39.039
to preserve the joint.

41:39.414 --> 41:42.083
Well, I'm inclined to agree
with Lieutenant Stactoe.

41:43.335 --> 41:46.254
Well, I believe we must perform
a mid-femoral amputation.

41:46.922 --> 41:49.341
Walter has a popliteal
aneurysm, meaning that--

41:49.716 --> 41:51.927
That the artery is
in danger of rupturing.

41:51.927 --> 41:52.802
Yes.

41:54.596 --> 41:55.472
You're right.

41:57.098 --> 41:58.183
<i>I'm so sorry, Walter.</i>

42:00.560 --> 42:02.062
I'll go fetch some boiling water.

42:02.062 --> 42:03.396
Boiling water?

42:04.189 --> 42:05.899
To sterilize the instruments

42:05.899 --> 42:07.859
to prevent post-operative infection.

42:08.526 --> 42:09.653
I see.

42:09.653 --> 42:11.321
Mrs. Fraser, you will not subject

42:11.947 --> 42:13.448
my blades to boiling water.

42:13.782 --> 42:15.825
<i>It will ruin the temper of the metal.</i>

42:15.825 --> 42:17.827
Hot water will do nothing but clean them,

42:18.328 --> 42:20.705
and I can't let you use
a dirty blade on this man.

42:20.830 --> 42:21.623
Let me?

42:22.749 --> 42:24.584
I do not need your permission, madam.

42:25.502 --> 42:28.171
Perhaps I should perform
the operation, Lieutenant,

42:28.630 --> 42:30.423
as the surgeon with a degree in medicine.

42:34.803 --> 42:36.221
Would thee care to assist me?

42:37.764 --> 42:38.640
I would.

42:39.140 --> 42:40.684
<i>Very well then, Dr. Hunter.</i>

42:40.809 --> 42:42.644
Butcher this man however you like,

42:44.062 --> 42:45.563
but you won't be using my equipment.

42:54.281 --> 42:55.156
No matter.

42:55.490 --> 42:56.491
I have a set of my own.

42:57.075 --> 42:58.326
I'll send my sister to fetch them

42:58.451 --> 43:00.287
along with a pan of boiling water.

43:03.665 --> 43:05.667
Walter, I think it best you get some rest.

43:17.971 --> 43:19.597
What are we doing here, Colonel?

43:20.432 --> 43:22.183
I was told there was a matter
of great importance.

43:22.183 --> 43:23.226
There is.

43:23.226 --> 43:24.185
See for yourself, sir.

43:34.404 --> 43:36.197
Is that our cannon and our soldiers?

43:37.449 --> 43:39.409
My men hauled it to the summit
this morning

43:39.409 --> 43:41.953
wi' the permission
of the captain of artillery.

43:41.953 --> 43:43.163
If they can do it, ye can be sure

43:43.163 --> 43:44.873
Simon Fraser and his men will, too.

43:46.166 --> 43:47.584
What are you doing?

43:48.168 --> 43:49.878
They're aiming at us.

43:54.841 --> 43:55.800
Stand down.

43:55.925 --> 43:57.344
We're not under attack!

44:00.472 --> 44:01.389
Have the men stop.

44:02.390 --> 44:04.225
Tell them to get back to their posts.

44:04.225 --> 44:05.852
Return to your posts!

44:07.395 --> 44:08.438
What have you done?

44:10.148 --> 44:11.775
The fort is within firing range.

44:12.359 --> 44:13.109
Now ye've seen it wi' yer own eyes.

44:13.234 --> 44:15.028
The only thing I have seen, Colonel,

44:15.945 --> 44:17.822
is your flagrant disregard for authority.

44:17.947 --> 44:19.574
I instructed them to aim wide, sir,

44:20.533 --> 44:22.243
only meant to demonstrate the
vulnerability of our defenses.

44:22.243 --> 44:23.912
By creating another?

44:23.912 --> 44:26.915
Taking men and cannon outside
the protection of these walls?

44:27.290 --> 44:28.708
What if they fell into enemy hands?

44:28.708 --> 44:30.585
This entire fort will fall
into the enemy's hands

44:30.585 --> 44:31.628
if we dinna put men on that hill.

44:31.628 --> 44:32.879
Enough.

44:32.879 --> 44:34.422
How dare you humiliate me, sir,

44:35.215 --> 44:38.051
disobeying my order with
this reckless public spectacle.

44:38.468 --> 44:40.929
I should put you in
chains for your insubordination!

44:41.638 --> 44:42.722
Fortunately for you,

44:43.431 --> 44:45.058
I cannot spare a single soldier.

44:46.059 --> 44:48.019
If and when the British attack, by land,

44:49.396 --> 44:51.523
we need every man inside
to defend the fort!

44:53.066 --> 44:55.068
Bring your men and that cannon back here,

44:55.652 --> 44:56.611
immediately.

44:57.487 --> 44:59.447
And they are not to leave the fort again.

45:16.714 --> 45:17.340
Ian Murray.

45:20.218 --> 45:20.969
Miss Hunter.

45:22.929 --> 45:24.639
I didna expect to see you again.

45:25.390 --> 45:27.100
<i>We heard there was
a need for surgeons.</i>

45:27.100 --> 45:29.144
My brother wished to lend
his support to the army.

45:29.144 --> 45:31.229
Hmm, that's brave of ye,
to leave yer home.

45:32.730 --> 45:34.649
<i>My friend William recovered well</i>

45:34.649 --> 45:37.068
and accompanied us
on a large part of our journey.

45:38.319 --> 45:40.697
We were grateful
for his protection on the road.

45:41.698 --> 45:43.032
Well, now that ye're here,

45:44.159 --> 45:45.076
I offer my protection.

45:46.286 --> 45:47.620
I welcome thy protection,

45:48.371 --> 45:50.165
though hope I don't need it.

45:54.669 --> 45:56.337
Are those medicinal herbs?

45:56.337 --> 45:57.213
Uh, aye.

45:57.589 --> 45:59.549
Um, whenever I'm sent off to scout,

45:59.549 --> 46:00.758
I forage for my Auntie Claire.

46:01.926 --> 46:03.261
Claire Fraser is thy aunt?

46:03.803 --> 46:05.638
We've been working closely with her.

46:06.097 --> 46:07.390
Suppose I'll be seein' more of ye.

46:07.515 --> 46:08.433
I suppose so.

46:17.150 --> 46:18.693
No sign of infection.

46:19.444 --> 46:20.695
And it's healing nicely.

46:22.363 --> 46:24.782
Ah, though you will have
to stay in bed for a while.

46:25.283 --> 46:27.118
So dancing's out of the question?

46:29.037 --> 46:30.663
You like to dance, Mr. Woodcock?

46:31.748 --> 46:32.749
My wife does.

46:34.083 --> 46:35.793
Yeah, that's how we fell in love...

46:37.420 --> 46:38.296
mm, dancing.

46:40.924 --> 46:42.592
I'm sure she misses you very much.

46:43.843 --> 46:44.719
I hope so.

46:45.261 --> 46:47.222
We, uh, didn't part on the best of terms.

46:51.100 --> 46:53.520
But thanks to you, I have
a chance to see her again.

46:56.731 --> 46:57.649
Put things right.

47:02.195 --> 47:04.072
<i>But then the tunnel
split in two directions.</i>

47:04.197 --> 47:05.740
Which way did you go?

47:06.407 --> 47:09.035
Well, luckily, I had studied
the tunnel schematics,

47:09.869 --> 47:11.538
so I knew where to go; I went right.

47:12.038 --> 47:12.830
Magic.

47:13.790 --> 47:16.167
And that's why you always do
your homework, pal.

47:16.960 --> 47:18.169
<i>Exactly.</i>

47:18.169 --> 47:19.212
And then when I finally got out,

47:19.212 --> 47:20.755
all of my coworkers applauded.

47:24.133 --> 47:25.552
You were really brave, Mama.

47:25.677 --> 47:26.594
Oh.

47:27.220 --> 47:28.096
Thanks, kiddo.

47:28.596 --> 47:29.847
This calls for a toast.

47:30.473 --> 47:31.349
<i>Mm?</i>

47:33.643 --> 47:35.603
Cheers to my brave wife on her first day.

47:37.897 --> 47:38.773
Sláinte.

47:39.649 --> 47:40.608
Sláinte.

47:41.776 --> 47:43.236
- Sláinte.
- Yeah.

47:43.236 --> 47:44.237
Sláinte.

47:57.083 --> 47:58.918
Come with me for a minute?

48:02.255 --> 48:03.631
Finish your dessert, kids.

48:17.061 --> 48:18.479
I thought you had a great day?

48:19.689 --> 48:20.815
I didn't want
to upset you and the kids,

48:20.815 --> 48:21.691
but it was shit.

48:23.484 --> 48:24.819
It was totally horrible.

48:25.820 --> 48:26.529
I am furious, Roger.

48:29.365 --> 48:30.658
This-this wasn't just hazing.

48:30.658 --> 48:32.577
They did this to me because I'm a woman.

48:34.829 --> 48:36.122
Arseholes.

48:36.247 --> 48:37.832
I knew this was gonna be hard.

48:39.167 --> 48:40.585
I knew that, but I'm-I just--

48:42.253 --> 48:44.464
I'm worried
they're never gonna respect me.

48:45.340 --> 48:47.675
I imagine that's what
it was like for your mother

48:47.675 --> 48:49.510
that first day at Harvard Medical School.

48:50.845 --> 48:52.930
Being the only woman
in a class full of men,

48:54.766 --> 48:55.892
it's not gonna be easy.

48:56.643 --> 48:58.436
But you made it through today...

48:59.854 --> 49:01.773
and I think that's something
worth celebratin'.

49:07.862 --> 49:09.530
I have a little something for you.

49:20.375 --> 49:21.709
A hidden drawer?

49:23.294 --> 49:24.420
I found it yesterday when one

49:24.420 --> 49:25.421
of the drawers got stuck.

49:29.300 --> 49:30.510
What is it?

49:36.349 --> 49:37.225
Wow.

49:38.893 --> 49:40.395
Oh, Roger. It's beautiful.

49:42.730 --> 49:44.524
I love it. You did not have to do this.

49:44.941 --> 49:45.900
I wanted to.

49:49.570 --> 49:51.114
You know, for you to use at work,

49:53.199 --> 49:54.450
to make sure you know

49:54.450 --> 49:55.660
that I am so proud of you.

49:58.621 --> 50:01.332
And I'm sorry I didn't make
that clearer from the start.

50:04.711 --> 50:05.586
Thank you.

50:16.973 --> 50:19.100
Maybe you should put
your knickers back on.

50:22.979 --> 50:24.105
Jem, what's goin' on?

50:24.230 --> 50:25.898
It wasn't me, I swear.

50:25.898 --> 50:27.275
She saw someone outside and was scared,

50:27.400 --> 50:28.735
<i>but I didn't see anyone.</i>

50:29.527 --> 50:31.028
Mandy, honey, hey.

50:31.988 --> 50:33.156
Did you see someone outside?

50:33.281 --> 50:34.240
The Nuckelavee.

50:36.409 --> 50:38.411
Well, maybe she did see someone.

50:39.912 --> 50:42.373
I saw some, uh, food wrappings
on the ground earlier.

50:42.957 --> 50:43.833
I'll have a look.

50:47.044 --> 50:48.421
Hon, shh, shh. You're okay.

50:49.630 --> 50:50.631
Jem, you okay, baby?

51:38.513 --> 51:39.472
Goddammit!

51:43.726 --> 51:46.562
Burgoyne's cannon will likely
reach the summit by daybreak.

51:46.562 --> 51:48.481
How is it we were not prepared for this?

51:50.817 --> 51:52.318
No one could have foreseen it, sir.

51:53.277 --> 51:56.072
Do we think their
cannon can reach our walls?

51:56.864 --> 51:58.533
I think they can, sir.

52:03.579 --> 52:05.206
Then I see no other choice.

52:05.206 --> 52:06.207
We must evacuate immediately.

52:08.251 --> 52:10.795
But sir, we cannot abandon
the fort without a fight.

52:11.212 --> 52:13.464
Burgoyne's soldiers outnumber
ours twofold.

52:14.215 --> 52:15.424
If they breach our walls--

52:15.424 --> 52:17.134
Mayor General, if I may...

52:19.136 --> 52:21.222
I've already ordered my men
to commandeer boats and canoes

52:21.222 --> 52:22.431
<i>at Lake Champlain.</i>

52:22.431 --> 52:24.600
The water will carry civilians faster

52:24.600 --> 52:25.977
than the British can march.

52:27.770 --> 52:28.896
Take as many as you can.

52:29.605 --> 52:31.607
The rest of you,
gather supplies and artillery.

52:31.732 --> 52:33.943
<i>Destroy whatever you cannot carry.</i>

52:33.943 --> 52:36.445
We must leave nothing behind
for Burgoyne's army.

52:44.245 --> 52:45.121
<i>Bree?</i>

52:48.749 --> 52:50.793
<i>The kids are in the house,
glued to the telly,</i>

52:50.793 --> 52:52.169
<i>so we have about 15 minutes.</i>

52:53.796 --> 52:54.672
I think, uh,

52:56.299 --> 52:58.301
I have an appointment for an inspection.

52:59.343 --> 53:00.595
<i>Oh, do you now?</i>

53:04.432 --> 53:05.391
I'd love to, but...

53:07.310 --> 53:08.269
But?

53:14.442 --> 53:15.985
There's something I have to do.

53:25.494 --> 53:26.913
I'll be here when ye get home.

53:41.552 --> 53:43.095
You coming again that weekend?

53:44.805 --> 53:47.058
<i>Wrong place, lassie.</i>

53:47.808 --> 53:49.393
<i>Knitting club's down the street.</i>

53:54.899 --> 53:56.776
So who do I have to lock in a tunnel

53:56.776 --> 53:57.902
to get a drink around here?

54:07.203 --> 54:09.038
Well, I heard you made it out
in record time, Hen.

54:12.959 --> 54:14.627
No, seriously. Seriously.

54:16.087 --> 54:18.464
You see, Craig here would have
definitely gotten lost.

54:18.464 --> 54:19.882
Yeah, he'd be in there
for about three days.

54:20.007 --> 54:22.176
No, he'd have
still been in there.

54:22.176 --> 54:23.511
Oh, no, he'd have still

54:23.511 --> 54:25.012
<i>- been in there.
- No, no, no, no, man.</i>

54:27.098 --> 54:28.140
<i>Hey, Donny!</i>

54:28.933 --> 54:31.394
Bring a pint of your finest
over here for my colleague.

54:31.394 --> 54:33.020
<i>Yeah, no, no, no, man.</i>

54:34.480 --> 54:37.441
Look, you had
your fun and games yesterday.

54:38.067 --> 54:39.443
We'll call it a clean slate.

54:40.987 --> 54:43.114
But if you ever do anything
like that again,

54:43.698 --> 54:45.032
I will have the lot of you fired.

54:47.868 --> 54:49.745
- <i>That works!</i>
- <i>It does.</i>

54:49.745 --> 54:51.330
Oh, and don't call me "Hen."

54:51.330 --> 54:53.249
<i>Well, it works for some people.</i>

54:56.961 --> 54:57.878
Fair enough, Gov.

55:05.594 --> 55:06.595
<i>How long do we have?</i>

55:06.721 --> 55:07.805
A few hours at most.

55:10.016 --> 55:11.434
We'll bring as many as we can.

55:19.358 --> 55:21.485
Are we under attack, Mrs. Fraser?

55:22.486 --> 55:23.362
Walter...

55:25.197 --> 55:26.282
we have to evacuate.

55:26.657 --> 55:28.784
Oh, I think I can walk
with a little support.

55:29.326 --> 55:30.411
I'm so sorry,

55:31.287 --> 55:32.163
but it's too soon.

55:32.288 --> 55:33.664
The sutures won't hold.

55:34.373 --> 55:35.374
It's too dangerous.

55:36.876 --> 55:38.294
If there were any way I could,

55:39.336 --> 55:40.046
I'd take you with me.

55:44.091 --> 55:44.967
I understand.

55:50.431 --> 55:51.348
Uh, you go on then.

55:52.725 --> 55:54.560
Big Red needs you and so do the others.

55:57.480 --> 55:58.898
It's best that you stay here.

56:00.441 --> 56:01.942
You're injured. The British will

56:01.942 --> 56:03.027
have to show you mercy.

56:04.320 --> 56:05.196
Mercy.

56:09.575 --> 56:10.910
If you keep the wound clean

56:12.536 --> 56:13.788
and don't put too much strain on it,

56:13.788 --> 56:14.872
it will heal quickly.

56:16.082 --> 56:16.957
Here.

56:17.958 --> 56:19.001
This is laudanum.

56:19.835 --> 56:22.046
It will help with the pain
and help you sleep.

56:24.173 --> 56:25.424
Just don't take too much.

56:29.345 --> 56:31.055
This war, it will be over one day...

56:34.016 --> 56:35.559
and you can go home to your wife.

56:40.314 --> 56:41.232
Goodbye, Walter.

56:42.191 --> 56:43.400
Godspeed, Mrs. Fraser.

57:03.879 --> 57:04.630
<i>Come now.</i>

57:05.297 --> 57:06.465
- <i>Grab a paddle.</i>
- Quick as ye can.

57:06.465 --> 57:07.383
<i>Grab a paddle.</i>

57:07.383 --> 57:09.343
Follow the boats that have gone ahead.

58:15.784 --> 58:17.453
Jem said he built this for you, Da.

58:20.331 --> 58:22.708
He said that he and Mandy come
here to talk to you.

58:27.254 --> 58:28.130
Well...

58:32.885 --> 58:34.678
Something I think you'd be proud of,

58:35.387 --> 58:36.889
got a new job, working at a dam.

58:41.644 --> 58:43.854
Well, I'm-I'm the plant inspector,

58:44.563 --> 58:46.565
which kinda means I'm everybody's boss.

58:48.442 --> 58:51.111
It's not really that easy,
tellin' the lads what to do.

58:52.696 --> 58:54.531
Even in this time, it's complicated.

58:56.617 --> 58:58.160
<i>Roger and I bought Lallybroch.</i>

58:59.328 --> 59:00.746
<i>I wish you and Ma could see it.</i>
