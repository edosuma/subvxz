00:07.841 --> 00:12.331
Okay, I want everybody to close your
eyes and find your happy place.

00:14.174 --> 00:17.038
Now imagine all
the good things in your life.

00:17.108 --> 00:21.438
Great shoes, perfect hair...

00:22.374 --> 00:24.806
- Very berry lip shine.
- Very berry lip shine.

00:28.842 --> 00:32.569
Wow, even though I can't see it,
it's still annoying.

00:34.008 --> 00:37.701
I know, now it's in my happy place.

00:38.642 --> 00:40.403
Okay, open your eyes.

00:40.542 --> 00:42.633
Now that you had time
to think about what you have,

00:42.709 --> 00:45.106
it's time to think about
those who aren't as lucky.

00:45.709 --> 00:48.300
Yes, it's time again for our school

00:48.375 --> 00:50.170
to raise money for the...

00:51.743 --> 00:53.709
United People's Relief Fund.

00:54.110 --> 00:58.202
And you, my little relievers,
are going to help the less fortunate.

00:58.276 --> 01:00.867
Like Ms. Dawson, the librarian?

01:01.143 --> 01:03.109
Ms. Dawson is not less fortunate.

01:03.176 --> 01:05.768
She chooses to dress that way.

01:05.843 --> 01:09.241
It's too bad, she could be
all that and a bowl of pudding.

01:10.043 --> 01:11.873
I'm sorry I'm late, Mr. Corelli.

01:11.944 --> 01:15.240
I was on my way to school when I had
to wrestle a cat away from a baby bird

01:15.310 --> 01:17.742
and then I felt sorry for the cat
so I had to go to the pet store

01:17.810 --> 01:20.867
to get him some food and then I saw
this lost dog with a sore paw...

01:20.944 --> 01:22.467
Whoa, Sarah.

01:22.544 --> 01:26.442
Why is it every time I talk to you
I get the urge to give blood...

01:26.511 --> 01:30.807
And call my mom? Which, if you knew
my mom, it's sort of the same thing.

01:31.878 --> 01:33.867
I'm sorry, where were we?

01:34.344 --> 01:36.276
You were crushing on Ms. Dawson.

01:37.478 --> 01:40.342
No, I wasn't.
I was thinking about pudding.

01:42.145 --> 01:45.804
Moving on.
United People's Relief Fund.

01:45.878 --> 01:50.368
Like last year, the person or team
that raises the most cha-ching

01:50.445 --> 01:52.240
gets a day off school,

01:53.512 --> 01:56.740
picture in the newspaper. Yeah!

01:56.812 --> 02:01.608
And a $300 gift card to the Malibu Mall.

02:03.313 --> 02:06.074
Finally, lunch time!

02:07.146 --> 02:09.668
We have to win.
I need a new deck for my skateboard.

02:09.746 --> 02:11.712
I just want to win so
Amber and Ashley don't.

02:11.779 --> 02:15.041
Otherwise it's gonna be
another year of listening to them gloat.

02:15.279 --> 02:18.268
Hey, guys, look,
we know we gloated last year

02:18.346 --> 02:20.369
and we feel really bad about that.

02:20.546 --> 02:24.808
So we just wanted to say good luck.
May the best fundraiser win.

02:25.446 --> 02:27.412
Okay, something
doesn't smell right here.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.571
Sorry.

02:29.947 --> 02:32.674
I knew I shouldn't
have had that breakfast burrito.

02:32.747 --> 02:35.543
I'm talking about Amber and Ashley.
They're up to something.

02:35.614 --> 02:38.875
- And we just have to watch our backs.
- You got it.

02:39.790 --> 02:42.861

03:42.916 --> 03:46.440
Okay, this has been going on
for 2 hours. What gives, people?

03:47.217 --> 03:49.775
- Hi, Miley.
- Hi, Lilly.

03:50.951 --> 03:54.246
Okay, this has
Amber and Ashley written all over it.

03:56.017 --> 03:59.505
Actually, it has "dork" and "dorkier"
written all over it.

04:00.151 --> 04:02.776
That's it! They are gonna pay for this!

04:02.851 --> 04:06.443
Wait, wait, was I "dork" or "dorkier"?

04:07.485 --> 04:09.916
It's important to me.

04:09.984 --> 04:13.973
What's important is not letting Amber
and Ashley win the charity drive again.

04:14.151 --> 04:16.879
I'm sick of seeing their
snobby faces everywhere I turn.

04:22.219 --> 04:23.582
Check it out, losers.

04:23.651 --> 04:26.742
This is as close
as you'll ever get to one of these.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.511
We'll see about that.

04:30.586 --> 04:32.575
We'll knock every door
until our knuckles bleed.

04:32.652 --> 04:35.880
We'll beg, and we'll plead, and we
won't take no for an answer.

04:38.552 --> 04:40.074
No!

04:40.552 --> 04:41.540
No!

04:42.519 --> 04:43.507
Sic him, Butchie.

04:45.286 --> 04:46.274
No!

04:47.486 --> 04:50.385
Okay, I think it's time
we kick it up a notch!

04:50.453 --> 04:54.351
One, two, three,
let's bring the cha-ching!

04:54.487 --> 04:56.783
Hi, we're juggling for charity!

05:05.220 --> 05:07.948
Howdy, y'all.
We're plucking for charity.

05:09.920 --> 05:13.647
<i>... and a partridge in a pear tree</i>

05:13.720 --> 05:16.845
Merry Christmas
and don't forget the less fortunate!

05:17.020 --> 05:20.009
Christmas?
Last time I dozed off it was September.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.713
The grandkids'll be here any minute.

05:22.788 --> 05:25.379
I've gotta get the elves out of the attic.

05:36.688 --> 05:38.052
Good game, Son.

05:38.122 --> 05:41.020
- I almost didn't score a point.
- Don't feel bad, Dad.

05:41.088 --> 05:44.577
One of these days,
maybe you'll finally win one.

05:44.756 --> 05:49.051
If he wanted to he could win them all,
fool. He's just playing you.

05:49.122 --> 05:51.645
- Why would he do that?
- He feels sorry for you.

05:51.722 --> 05:55.280
I mean, look at you, for a basketball
player, you're a short little fella.

05:56.223 --> 05:59.212
Dad, that's not true, right?
I mean, you're not letting me win?

05:59.323 --> 06:02.846
Of course not, Son.
I think you're really, really good.

06:05.623 --> 06:06.611
What is all that?

06:06.690 --> 06:10.178
I'm just cooling myself down
after a brutal beating.

06:11.189 --> 06:13.314
It is a tad bit humid out here.

06:13.389 --> 06:17.186
Yeah, yeah, nice try.
But I know what that means, all right?

06:17.823 --> 06:21.085
Now I want you to stand in front of
the basket and try this time.

06:21.157 --> 06:24.055
- Oh, Son, I'm a little tired.
- Dad, please. I have to know.

06:25.690 --> 06:28.054
Okay, but just remember,
you asked for it.

06:28.124 --> 06:29.112
All right.

06:30.357 --> 06:31.345
Here we go.

06:35.190 --> 06:38.588
All right, let's see what
you got down low, Oldylocks!

06:42.058 --> 06:43.717
Oh, man, he was right!

06:44.058 --> 06:48.320
You let me win. Wait a minute.
Do you always let me win?

06:48.791 --> 06:50.655
I'm sorry, Son. It's just that...

06:50.724 --> 06:53.657
I love seeing how
happy you get when you win.

06:53.825 --> 06:56.984
Plus, when you lose,
you do make that little pouty face.

06:57.058 --> 06:59.354
- I do not.
- There it is.

06:59.959 --> 07:02.982
Well, this ends right now!
I'm gonna beat you at something, Dad!

07:03.059 --> 07:05.354
And I am gonna beat you so bad.

07:05.425 --> 07:09.051
Son, you got your health.
You got a nice car.

07:09.692 --> 07:11.420
Why go looking for unhappiness?

07:15.392 --> 07:18.517
- Okay, that does it. Name your game.
- All right.

07:18.593 --> 07:21.150
One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war.

07:24.826 --> 07:28.156
It's okay, Son, it's not your fault.
You got your mom's thumbs.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.687
I have girl thumbs?

07:35.160 --> 07:38.718
Sarah, show me the money!

07:38.893 --> 07:41.860
Wow, dudette,
how'd you raise so much?

07:42.227 --> 07:44.853
Well, I learned good charity skills
from my parents.

07:44.927 --> 07:46.756
They met at a Red Cross blood drive,

07:46.827 --> 07:48.349
and then
honeymooned in the Peace Corps

07:48.427 --> 07:51.587
- building aqueducts for...
- Great story. Next!

07:52.460 --> 07:56.018
Ah, yes. The three <i>amigos. </i>
Show me the money!

07:58.228 --> 08:01.353
- Seriously. Show me the money.
- That's all we could raise.

08:01.994 --> 08:05.859
- Aren't you going to hit the gong?
- Oh, I got a special one for you.

08:11.995 --> 08:13.790
"Aren't you
going to hit the gong?"

08:13.862 --> 08:16.828
It's better than no gong at all.

08:17.062 --> 08:18.721
Okay, maybe we're not winning,

08:18.795 --> 08:21.727
but thanks to Sarah,
neither are Amber and Ashley.

08:21.928 --> 08:25.622
Last year's champions are at it again!

08:26.329 --> 08:30.159
Looks like somebody's
going for the two-peat.

08:32.895 --> 08:34.691
How'd you guys earn so much money?

08:34.763 --> 08:37.126
Simple. We just went to the B of D.

08:37.196 --> 08:38.923
- What's that?
- The Bank of Dad.

08:40.096 --> 08:43.119
That is so unfair.
We worked so much harder than you.

08:43.196 --> 08:45.753
Yeah! We walked ten miles,
faked six different accents

08:45.829 --> 08:50.194
and sang <i>The Twelve Days of</i>
<i>Christmas</i> 58 stinking times.

08:50.463 --> 08:53.327
Wow, you're right. You did work harder.

08:53.396 --> 08:55.589
We're just smarter...

08:55.663 --> 08:56.924
And richer.

09:00.296 --> 09:01.489
I don't care what it takes.

09:01.563 --> 09:04.859
This time, I refuse
to let them get the better of us.

09:06.830 --> 09:08.421
Miley?
- Not now, Oliver.

09:09.598 --> 09:10.586
Okay.

09:15.264 --> 09:17.890
- This is a good idea, Coop.
- I told you, man.

09:17.965 --> 09:21.624
With Ping-Pong you don't have to be
tall, strong or good-looking.

09:21.931 --> 09:26.193
Exactly!
Wait a minute, I'm good-looking.

09:27.865 --> 09:29.422
Sure you are.

09:30.365 --> 09:34.559
Now, grab a paddle
and let's get our Ping-Pong on.

09:34.632 --> 09:36.325
All right, bring it on, baby!

09:41.699 --> 09:43.164
Sorry, Mr. Fluffers!

10:12.100 --> 10:13.622
Yeah!

10:20.134 --> 10:22.293
Great, now I have to
teach you how to dance.

10:27.768 --> 10:29.529
Okay, here he comes!

10:35.801 --> 10:37.392
Wow, a three-part sigh.

10:37.701 --> 10:41.429
Usually when I hear a sigh like that,
my wallet hurts.

10:41.502 --> 10:44.195
Daddy, I know you
already gave a big donation,

10:44.268 --> 10:45.598
but Amber and Ashley's parents...

10:45.668 --> 10:47.395
Now, you know
what I always say, honey.

10:47.468 --> 10:51.298
You can buy a thirsty man a cow,
and he'll have all the milk he wants

10:51.368 --> 10:54.493
but he still won't have enough
to wash down his cookies.

10:55.435 --> 10:56.423
- What?
- Huh?

10:56.735 --> 10:59.599
He said he's happy to give to charity
but this is a chance for us

10:59.668 --> 11:01.964
to learn to be creative
and raise the money ourselves.

11:02.035 --> 11:04.728
And then something about cookies.

11:04.802 --> 11:08.030
Maybe Hannah can ask a few people.

11:08.102 --> 11:10.728
Maybe Hannah can ask a lot of people.

11:11.469 --> 11:14.924
<i> Who said, who said</i>
<i>I can't be Superman</i>

11:15.136 --> 11:18.500
<i>I say, I say that I know I can</i>

11:18.870 --> 11:21.961
<i>Who said, who said</i>
<i>I won't be President</i>

11:22.370 --> 11:26.325
<i>I say, I say you ain't seen nothing yet</i>

11:26.403 --> 11:30.301
<i>Whoa, yeah</i>

11:32.370 --> 11:33.631
<i>Who said?</i>

11:35.137 --> 11:37.467
<i>Come on, yeah</i>

11:38.937 --> 11:39.925
<i>That's right</i>

11:41.138 --> 11:42.501
Thank you! Thank you all.

11:42.570 --> 11:45.866
Now, before I start my next song,
I would just like to give a shout out

11:45.937 --> 11:48.732
to a great charity called
United People's Relief.

11:48.804 --> 11:51.600
So, show your love
and make a donation.

11:53.471 --> 11:56.835
Guys, please!
Paper money only, people!

11:57.004 --> 11:58.971
I bruise like a cantaloupe!

12:10.972 --> 12:13.097
I can't believe
how much Hannah pulled in.

12:13.172 --> 12:17.662
I know! And it was easier than finding
a mullet at a truckers' convention.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.338
- Huh?
- What?

12:20.405 --> 12:23.735
Y'all wouldn't last
2 minutes in Tennessee.

12:23.806 --> 12:26.431
I just can't wait to see the look on
Amber and Ashley's faces

12:26.506 --> 12:27.699
when they find out we won.

12:27.773 --> 12:30.398
I can't believe we lost.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.531
Hello, sir or madam,
would you like to donate...

12:39.607 --> 12:42.970
- Oh, hi, Miley. You live here?
- Yeah, come on in, Sarah.

12:43.039 --> 12:45.437
- So how's the collecting going?
- Pretty good.

12:45.507 --> 12:48.337
I woke up at 4:00 this morning so I
could raise money at the fish market,

12:48.406 --> 12:50.964
and then I caught the end of the
graveyard shift at the meat plant,

12:51.040 --> 12:52.300
then sunrise aerobics
at the Yoga Mat...

12:52.373 --> 12:56.601
- You get up this early every morning?
- No, on Saturdays I sleep in till 5:30.

12:58.840 --> 13:01.772
Then I go to an old folks' home
and serve breakfast.

13:01.874 --> 13:03.500
Why am I not surprised?

13:03.574 --> 13:05.506
I just really want that gift card.

13:05.574 --> 13:09.131
So I can buy a bunch of clothes and
then donate them to needy children.

13:10.975 --> 13:12.497
Needy children?

13:12.841 --> 13:14.500
You'd donate the whole gift card?

13:14.574 --> 13:16.403
You wouldn't even
buy yourself a pair of socks?

13:16.474 --> 13:18.531
I already have two pairs of socks.

13:18.741 --> 13:21.764
A pair and a spare.
Who needs more than that?

13:22.775 --> 13:25.207
Normal people?

13:25.275 --> 13:28.139
Whoa! How did you guys
raise so much money?

13:28.675 --> 13:30.868
You must have worked
really, really hard.

13:32.075 --> 13:34.234
Well...

13:35.542 --> 13:36.667
What we did was...

13:36.742 --> 13:38.731
- We did this thing.
- Thing!

13:39.143 --> 13:41.336
Yeah, and... Excuse me!

13:42.475 --> 13:43.964
- Excuse us.
- Yeah.

13:45.776 --> 13:49.038
Guys, we've got to give
the Hannah money to Sarah.

13:49.109 --> 13:50.166
- What?
- No.

13:50.243 --> 13:52.106
Yeah, she's worked
harder than any of us.

13:52.176 --> 13:54.233
And she's the only one doing it
for the right reasons.

13:54.309 --> 13:56.707
Reasons, schmeasons,
I want my new skateboard!

13:57.176 --> 13:58.802
Lilly, you know she deserves to win.

13:58.877 --> 14:01.365
And when she does win
we still get to see Amber and Ashley

14:01.443 --> 14:03.466
crushed like the little bugs they are!

14:06.077 --> 14:08.975
Okay. Let's go give
Miss Goody Two-socks the money.

14:11.410 --> 14:13.875
Hey, Sarah, we decided that

14:13.943 --> 14:17.774
you should try the Brustroms
down the street. They're loaded.

14:17.844 --> 14:20.708
I mean, in case they're not home,

14:20.778 --> 14:23.505
we'd like to make a donation
to your fund-raising.

14:25.078 --> 14:28.601
No, I can't take your money.
You guys worked really hard.

14:29.111 --> 14:31.100
- Not as hard as you.
- Trust us.

14:31.178 --> 14:34.633
No. I couldn't sleep at night if I took
credit for someone else's work.

14:35.211 --> 14:38.109
And that would be really bad
considering how early I get up.

14:39.111 --> 14:41.373
It never ends.

14:42.145 --> 14:44.475
Besides, I still have a chance to win.

14:44.812 --> 14:46.402
There's a carnival at the beach tonight.

14:46.478 --> 14:48.001
And if I stand under the Loop de Loop,

14:48.079 --> 14:51.204
I might be able to
catch some spare change.

14:51.346 --> 14:55.039
While I dodge the vomit. Okay, bye.

14:57.845 --> 14:59.834
We've got to find a way
to make her take the money.

14:59.945 --> 15:01.877
Yeah. And maybe an umbrella.

15:03.513 --> 15:06.002
I bet she'd take a donation
from a generous celebrity.

15:06.079 --> 15:07.909
- I bet she would.
- Yeah, right.

15:07.980 --> 15:09.969
Where are we gonna find one of those?

15:13.280 --> 15:15.007
You'd think he'd learn by now.

15:18.780 --> 15:20.440
- Not today.
- Take that.

15:20.580 --> 15:21.909
- Come on, big boy!
- Slam!

15:22.813 --> 15:25.678
I did it. I won.

15:25.747 --> 15:28.941
I beat my daddy! I beat my daddy!

15:29.280 --> 15:34.303
Well, I'll be darned. You beat me.
You actually beat the old man.

15:34.447 --> 15:40.210
Oh, come on, Dad. I didn't beat you.
I destroyed you, I crushed you.

15:40.448 --> 15:43.608
I buried you under
an avalanche of Jackson.

15:44.381 --> 15:47.938
- Nobody likes a sore winner, Son.
- Who's pouting now?

15:48.947 --> 15:49.936
Nobody's pouting.

15:50.014 --> 15:52.480
Whatever you say,
Mr. Pouty McPoutpants.

15:53.782 --> 15:58.339
Okay, I'm just gonna
go get my towel. Pouty McPoutpants.

15:59.748 --> 16:02.408
See that. I beat you again.

16:02.481 --> 16:04.471
Okay, Jackson, it's not like
we was having a race

16:04.549 --> 16:06.572
to see who could get to the towels first.

16:06.649 --> 16:09.672
Even if we were, you'd lose.

16:10.816 --> 16:14.213
You know, everything doesn't
have to be a competition, Son.

16:16.616 --> 16:20.071
- Okay, now you're just being silly.
- Am I?

16:35.350 --> 16:37.873
- Best two out of three?
- Oh, you are so on.

16:37.950 --> 16:38.938
Oh, yeah!

16:46.850 --> 16:50.146
Thank you so much
for donating to United People's Relief.

16:51.317 --> 16:52.782
Okay. There she is.

16:52.850 --> 16:55.180
All right, let's just donate the money
and get out of here

16:55.251 --> 16:57.717
before anyone spots Hannah.

16:59.618 --> 17:02.607
- Hey.
- Hi, would you like to donate to...

17:02.718 --> 17:06.116
You... And you're here... And...

17:06.185 --> 17:07.242
Shh!

17:10.050 --> 17:11.983
- I'm guessing she's a fan.
- You think?

17:12.885 --> 17:15.942
Sarah, come on, wake up, Sarah.
Look, there's a kitten up a tree.

17:16.018 --> 17:17.483
What? Kitten? Where?

17:17.785 --> 17:19.842
I could have sworn
I saw... Hannah Montana!

17:19.917 --> 17:20.974
Shh!

17:21.050 --> 17:22.881
Look, it's Hannah Montana!

17:23.385 --> 17:24.476
Oh, boy.

17:32.418 --> 17:35.180
They're right behind us. Now what?

17:35.253 --> 17:37.616
Quick, up here.

17:39.419 --> 17:40.816
Yippie ki-yay.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.581
Where'd she go?
Where's Hannah Montana?

17:52.653 --> 17:54.380
Look! There she goes.

17:55.353 --> 17:57.512
- I meant that way!
- I meant that way!

17:57.586 --> 17:59.018
You better split up!

18:03.654 --> 18:05.415
- Something ain't right.
- You look good in purple.

18:05.487 --> 18:06.544
Thank you.

18:10.387 --> 18:13.717
Okay. I know we're close,
but this is just ridiculous.

18:18.721 --> 18:21.187
Oh, wow! You, you.

18:21.255 --> 18:23.050
Want us to donate to
United People's Relief.

18:23.121 --> 18:26.679
I thought you'd never ask.
Lola, give her the money.

18:27.754 --> 18:29.243
Lola, release!

18:31.988 --> 18:34.716
Don't you dare faint again.
You're welcome. Goodbye.

18:36.055 --> 18:37.611
- So, that went well.
- Yep.

18:37.688 --> 18:40.518
By the way, thanks for pinching me
back there in the ball pit.

18:40.588 --> 18:42.554
I didn't pinch you, you pinched me.

18:51.389 --> 18:52.820
This is going to be so great.

18:52.889 --> 18:55.321
Yeah, after all our work,
Sarah better be happy.

18:55.389 --> 18:57.981
She better
buy herself a new pair of socks.

18:58.055 --> 19:01.180
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for,

19:01.756 --> 19:04.950
the winner of this year's fund raiser is...

19:14.757 --> 19:21.280
Mr. Corelli.
- Oh, sorry. Amber and Ashley!

19:21.457 --> 19:22.821
Yeah... What?

19:23.624 --> 19:25.715
How could they have
raised more money than...

19:25.791 --> 19:27.586
I mean us... I mean Sarah?

19:29.557 --> 19:32.887
Once we found out that someone
had raised more money than we did,

19:32.957 --> 19:34.889
we just asked our parents
to write another check.

19:34.957 --> 19:38.889
Now, if you'll excuse us, we've got to
do an interview for the newspaper.

19:39.625 --> 19:43.557
I don't understand. How did they
find out how much money was raised?

19:45.191 --> 19:46.384
Oliver?

19:47.992 --> 19:52.788
Okay, maybe I bragged a little about
how Sarah was going to beat them.

19:55.092 --> 19:56.580
Button it.

20:00.125 --> 20:02.353
I just feel bad for Sarah.
She's gonna be crushed.

20:02.425 --> 20:07.357
- Yay, good for you!
- Yeah, she's taking it real hard.

20:09.959 --> 20:12.221
Sarah, why are you so happy?
I thought you wanted to win.

20:12.292 --> 20:15.554
It isn't about winning.
It's about raising money for charity.

20:15.626 --> 20:17.354
That's all that really matters.

20:19.426 --> 20:21.119
You know what, guys, she's right.

20:21.193 --> 20:24.353
A little annoying, but right.

20:25.993 --> 20:28.289
It's just a shame
Amber and Ashley won.

20:28.360 --> 20:31.053
They're never gonna do all the good
stuff Sarah would've done.

20:31.126 --> 20:33.957
Who knows, they might surprise you.

20:34.960 --> 20:38.051
If I could just have a quote,
how do you feel right now?

20:38.660 --> 20:42.024
Well, we're just so happy
for the Universal Relief.

20:42.327 --> 20:44.418
You mean United People's Relief.

20:44.494 --> 20:47.891
Whatever you call it,
people are going to be relieved.

20:48.494 --> 20:50.756
Oh! And they didn't even
tell you the best part.

20:50.828 --> 20:52.589
They're going to take
all the money from the gift card

20:52.661 --> 20:54.490
to buy clothes for the needy children.

20:54.561 --> 20:55.754
- Needy who?
- Needy who?

20:55.828 --> 20:56.919
Ooh!

20:56.995 --> 20:58.052
Not now!

20:58.128 --> 21:02.254
Wow. You two are amazing.
This is gonna be a great story.

21:02.328 --> 21:04.520
- Yeah, well, the truth is...
- But wait, there's more.

21:04.594 --> 21:05.651
No, there's not. Really.

21:05.728 --> 21:08.559
Oh, come on. Don't be modest.
Go ahead, Lilly.

21:08.761 --> 21:10.193
They're going to spend
their day off school

21:10.262 --> 21:13.319
volunteering and washing dishes
at the soup kitchen.

21:13.529 --> 21:15.290
Soup kitchen.

21:16.929 --> 21:20.258
Oh, yeah. Make sure you
wear your hair nets, girls.

21:22.929 --> 21:25.394
I'll see you guys at the soup kitchen!

21:33.229 --> 21:35.559
Now that's a picture
I'll never get tired of.
