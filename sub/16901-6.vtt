WEBVTT

00:02.168 --> 00:04.432
Are you making waffles?
No. Quiet.

00:04.571 --> 00:07.471
Somebody is, and the maple syrup
smells delicious.

00:13.213 --> 00:14.510
Hey, I just wanted to make sure

00:14.647 --> 00:16.137
you're practicing
your Rerun dance

00:16.282 --> 00:17.681
for the "What's Happening!"
Sketch.

00:17.817 --> 00:20.445
I'm trying, Liz Lemon,
but I can't concentrate.

00:20.587 --> 00:22.851
Somebody on my block
is making waffles,

00:22.989 --> 00:24.081
and it's making me horny!

00:24.224 --> 00:25.623
Wait.
You smell maple syrup, too?

00:25.759 --> 00:27.124
You live all the way
in Jersey.

00:27.260 --> 00:28.625
That's weird.
Hold on.

00:29.729 --> 00:30.787
Hello?

00:30.930 --> 00:32.022
Do you smell maple syrup?

00:32.165 --> 00:33.325
Yes!

00:33.466 --> 00:35.934
Don't panic, Lemon. It's
probably not a chemical attack.

00:36.069 --> 00:37.263
What do you mean "probably"?

00:37.404 --> 00:39.395
It's probably
just a strange wind pattern

00:39.539 --> 00:41.302
coming off those factories
in Staten Island

00:41.441 --> 00:42.601
where food flavors
are made.

00:42.742 --> 00:44.403
I don't think it's Northrax.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.034
What's Northrax?

00:46.179 --> 00:48.841
It's a chemical agent we sold
to the Saudis in the 1980s.

00:48.982 --> 00:51.007
It smells exactly
like maple syrup,

00:51.151 --> 00:52.778
but I don't think
this is it.

00:52.919 --> 00:54.113
Well, how do you know?

00:54.254 --> 00:56.415
Because Northrax kills you
within 10 seconds.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.260
Okay,
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:26.653 --> 01:28.314
Make me look like this.

01:28.455 --> 01:29.945
Right.
Like that's a stretch.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.991
Hey, Jack,
thanks for that call last night.

01:33.126 --> 01:35.788
I get really nutburgers over
this Homeland Security stuff.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.557
Always check with me first,
Lemon. I have NSA connections.

01:38.698 --> 01:39.665
Good.

01:39.799 --> 01:41.699
Didn't you just get a haircut
two days ago?

01:41.835 --> 01:43.166
I get my hair cut
every two days.

01:43.303 --> 01:45.635
<i>After all,
your hair is your head suit.</i>

01:45.772 --> 01:47.706
I'm going to a party tonight
honoring Robert Novak.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.604
It's being thrown by John McCain
and Jack Bauer.

01:49.742 --> 01:51.505
Um, I don't think he's real.

01:51.644 --> 01:54.204
I assure you, Lemon,
John McCain is very real.

01:54.347 --> 01:55.507
I have to look perfect.

01:55.648 --> 01:58.981
When it comes to hair, no one is
more bitchy than conservative males.

01:59.119 --> 02:03.055
Good Lord, Donaghy, did you comb
your hair with a chicken bone?

02:05.391 --> 02:06.949
They can be brutal.

02:07.093 --> 02:08.526
Well, have fun.

02:08.661 --> 02:11.061
Don't get peer-pressured
into invading Iran.

02:11.197 --> 02:14.428
Oh, before you go,
I'd like you to put this on.

02:14.567 --> 02:17.195
Sheinhardt Wig Company?
What's this?

02:17.337 --> 02:19.362
A way to show support
for our parent company

02:19.506 --> 02:22.373
which is having
a little P. R. Hiccup right now.

02:22.509 --> 02:24.136
All right.
Thanks.

02:24.277 --> 02:26.177
I picked up your tuxedo
from the cleaners, Mr. Donaghy,

02:26.312 --> 02:27.210
just like you asked.

02:27.347 --> 02:28.336
Thank you, Kenneth.

02:28.481 --> 02:30.540
Let me just
take this plastic off,

02:30.683 --> 02:32.878
'cause I saw on "Martha Stewart"
how we're all doing everything wrong.

02:33.019 --> 02:34.008
Where are the pants?

02:34.954 --> 02:37.286
Sweet peaches,
what have I done?!

02:37.423 --> 02:39.789
Somewhere along the way, they
must've slipped out the bottom.

02:39.926 --> 02:41.291
It's all right, Kenneth.
These things happen.

02:41.427 --> 02:42.394
Ugh!

02:42.529 --> 02:43.928
Uncle Butch was right.

02:44.063 --> 02:45.496
I'm just a stupid
country bumpkin

02:45.632 --> 02:47.259
with great skin
and soft hands.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.992
I'll just have Jonathan
bring over another pair.

02:49.135 --> 02:51.103
No, sir.
This is my mistake.

02:51.237 --> 02:52.761
I will replace your pants.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.305
They cost $2,500.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.635
I will find your pants.

02:58.244 --> 03:01.839
All right!
My prescription shampoo!

03:04.083 --> 03:05.482
Oh.

03:09.055 --> 03:09.987
Who is it?
Hi!

03:10.123 --> 03:11.954
I have your mail.
I live across the hall.

03:13.593 --> 03:17.029
Hi. I didn't even realize anyone
had moved in over here. Welcome.

03:23.169 --> 03:26.366
I'm Liz.
What's your name?

03:26.506 --> 03:27.131
Raheem.

03:27.273 --> 03:29.969
Raheem.
That's my mother's name.

03:30.109 --> 03:31.701
No.
No, I'm just kidding.

03:31.844 --> 03:33.141
Give me my package, please.

03:33.279 --> 03:34.746
Okay.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.371
Well, it was nice to meet...

03:41.454 --> 03:42.478
<i>Coming up next,</i>

03:42.622 --> 03:45.352
<i>Candice Vandershark,
a Lifetime "Intimate Portrait. "</i>

03:45.491 --> 03:47.152
Have you met the guy
across the hall?

03:47.293 --> 03:48.487
Raheem? Yeah.
He's a good egg.

03:48.628 --> 03:50.493
He's weird.
He wouldn't shake my hand.

03:50.630 --> 03:52.598
And I think
it's because I'm a woman.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.701
And get this, he's got maps
all over his walls.

03:55.835 --> 03:56.699
Maps.

03:56.836 --> 03:58.167
Maps?

03:58.304 --> 03:59.532
You mean like that one?

03:59.672 --> 04:01.003
That's different.

04:01.140 --> 04:03.540
That's... That's an antique,
and I'm a white lady.

04:03.676 --> 04:04.802
What are you saying, there,
Liz?

04:04.944 --> 04:07.208
Pete, you know me.

04:07.347 --> 04:09.338
I never make assumptions
about race.

04:09.482 --> 04:12.076
Remember I asked that black guy
if he had seen "Sideways"?

04:12.218 --> 04:14.482
But this guy.
I don't like him.

04:14.621 --> 04:16.714
You're being paranoid.
Raheem is a really nice guy.

04:16.856 --> 04:17.845
He's always helping.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.288
He rewired the toaster oven,

04:19.425 --> 04:21.325
and he showed me a back way
to the airport.

04:21.461 --> 04:22.894
Listen to yourself, Pete!

04:23.029 --> 04:24.121
I don't want to sound racist,

04:24.264 --> 04:26.459
but that pita pocket
might be a terrorist.

04:28.034 --> 04:29.331
Does that sound racist?

04:29.469 --> 04:32.905
This rich, chestnut color
is natural? Ha!

04:33.039 --> 04:34.336
Excuse me.

04:35.375 --> 04:36.569
Whiskey, straight up.

04:37.510 --> 04:40.274
I'll have a white rum with a diet
ginger ale and a splash of lime.

04:40.413 --> 04:42.005
Wow.
I never would have pegged you

04:42.148 --> 04:44.446
for a University of Tennessee
sorority girl.

04:44.584 --> 04:47.018
You've got to pace yourself at
these things. We go all night.

04:47.153 --> 04:48.051
That's good advice.

04:48.187 --> 04:50.655
Unfortunately, I promised
Bill Frist the next slow dance.

04:52.592 --> 04:54.025
I'm C. C.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.184
Jack.

04:55.328 --> 04:56.955
Nice haircut.

05:00.533 --> 05:03.058
Sir,
here's your Nancy Drew.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.996
For men,
it's called a Hardy Boy.

05:16.382 --> 05:17.940
Hey, K. K.,
how's it hangin'?

05:18.084 --> 05:19.142
Very low, sir.

05:19.285 --> 05:20.411
Very low.

05:20.553 --> 05:21.815
I lost something
real important.

05:21.954 --> 05:23.615
Well, you know what I do
when I lose something?

05:23.756 --> 05:25.485
I yell real loud
until I find it.

05:25.625 --> 05:26.887
So, what is it
that you lost?

05:27.026 --> 05:27.651
Pants.

05:27.794 --> 05:29.819
Pants! Pants! Pants!

05:29.962 --> 05:32.897
Pants! Pants!
Pants! Pa...

05:33.032 --> 05:35.057
How about the Sean Johns?
Are you chaffing again, Tray?

05:35.201 --> 05:38.796
I don't think that's gonna help
me find Mr. Donaghy's pants.

05:38.938 --> 05:40.462
Well, did you retrace
your steps?

05:40.606 --> 05:41.630
Or go back
to the dry cleaners?

05:41.774 --> 05:43.332
Yes, Obvious Twins.

05:43.476 --> 05:45.842
And I tried looking in the last
place you'd ever expect,

05:45.978 --> 05:48.776
and, no, Mr. Donaghy's pants
are not in the ladies' room

05:48.915 --> 05:51.110
at that laser-tag place
on 12th Avenue.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.239
It's no use.

05:52.385 --> 05:54.080
I'm just gonna
have to replace them.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.450
But where am I
ever gonna get $2,500?

05:56.589 --> 05:57.988
Well, why don't you
just do like I do

05:58.124 --> 06:00.115
and sell your autograph
at the car show?

06:03.830 --> 06:07.459
What the world needs now?

06:07.600 --> 06:11.127
Is love, sweet love?

06:11.270 --> 06:13.534
It's the only thing?

06:13.673 --> 06:17.336
That there's just
too little of?

06:17.477 --> 06:21.038
What the world needs now?

06:32.692 --> 06:34.717
What the what?!

07:10.229 --> 07:11.856
Thank you
for an incredible night.

07:11.998 --> 07:13.363
Really?
Did you have a good time?

07:13.499 --> 07:14.431
'Cause I really did.

07:14.567 --> 07:15.431
Unbelievably good.

07:15.568 --> 07:17.536
And thank you for letting me
try that thing I tried.

07:17.670 --> 07:19.604
I'm sorry I dropped you.

07:19.739 --> 07:21.502
No.
No, it was great.

07:21.641 --> 07:23.768
Who knew that ottoman
had wheels, right?

07:25.778 --> 07:27.302
Well, I got to get to work.

07:33.386 --> 07:35.411
When can I see you again?

07:35.555 --> 07:38.046
Anytime.
You name it.

07:41.093 --> 07:42.219
<i>Congressman Cunningham,</i>

07:42.361 --> 07:44.056
<i>it is a pleasure
to have you on our program.</i>

07:44.197 --> 07:45.926
<i>Hi, Dan,
thank you for having me.</i>

07:46.065 --> 07:48.727
Celeste Cunningham.

07:48.868 --> 07:51.098
C. C.

07:51.237 --> 07:53.467
You didn't tell me
you're a congresswoman.

07:53.606 --> 07:56.370
I just ended
my first year.

07:56.509 --> 07:58.272
<i>...but also on some of your...</i>

07:58.411 --> 08:00.038
"D"?

08:00.179 --> 08:01.271
Vermont?

08:01.414 --> 08:03.405
<i>Big business
is out to get us again.</i>

08:03.549 --> 08:06.780
<i>The Sheinhardt Wig Company
has dumped thousands of gallons</i>

08:06.919 --> 08:08.978
<i>of Auburn Fantasy Dye
Number 260</i>

08:09.121 --> 08:10.418
<i>into the Chickatagua River,</i>

08:10.556 --> 08:13.252
<i>turning the children
of Chickatagua orange.</i>

08:13.392 --> 08:15.553
<i>And I will not rest
until this company</i>

08:15.695 --> 08:18.687
<i>and all of its subsidiaries are
held financially responsible.</i>

08:20.132 --> 08:21.326
Why do you have this?

08:21.467 --> 08:24.732
I run a Sheinhardt Wigs
subsidiary called NBC.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.133
Oh, my God.

08:26.272 --> 08:27.762
You're Jack Donaghy?

08:27.907 --> 08:30.239
What were you even doing
at that party last night?

08:30.376 --> 08:32.071
Oh, my God.
This was a mistake.

08:32.211 --> 08:34.736
Forget about what I said. I can
never be seen with you again.

08:34.881 --> 08:35.779
You're right.

08:35.914 --> 08:37.815
We have to pretend
that this never happened.

08:37.950 --> 08:39.746
Yeah,
I have to get out of here.

08:39.885 --> 08:41.046
Damn it.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.620
The worst part is...

08:42.755 --> 08:44.313
I really liked you a lot.

08:50.630 --> 08:53.531
I gave her the ottoman,
and she walked out.

08:54.233 --> 08:55.666
Sir, I typed up that letter.

08:55.801 --> 08:56.825
Hey, uh...

08:56.969 --> 08:58.027
What do you need, Lemon?

08:58.170 --> 09:01.071
Nothing.
I just, uh... It can wait.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.936
Lemon, there's nothing
you could say to me

09:03.075 --> 09:04.508
that you can't say
in front of Jonathan.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.506
I think my Middle Eastern neighbor is a
terrorist, and I don't know what to do.

09:08.648 --> 09:09.546
That's ridiculous, Lemon.

09:09.682 --> 09:10.774
Some of our greatest patriots

09:10.917 --> 09:12.316
have been
of Middle Eastern descent,

09:12.451 --> 09:14.009
and I am appalled
to hear you engage

09:14.153 --> 09:15.552
in racial profiling
like that.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.924
I'm kidding.
Be an American. Call it in.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.494
This is the number
of a friend of mine

09:23.629 --> 09:25.824
in a very high-level position
at Homeland Security.

09:25.965 --> 09:28.695
Oh, no. Now I don't know.
Maybe I'm just being paranoid.

09:28.834 --> 09:31.200
If a bleeding-heart liberal
like you has any suspicion...

09:31.337 --> 09:32.395
I know. Right?

09:35.141 --> 09:36.267
Nice ringtone, Jack.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.842
That's not my ringtone.

09:37.977 --> 09:39.410
I hate
that San Francisco sound.

09:39.545 --> 09:41.945
How am I calling myself?

09:42.081 --> 09:43.548
This isn't even my phone.

09:44.650 --> 09:45.708
Jack?
C. C?

09:45.851 --> 09:47.113
I think I have your phone.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.949
Yeah, you must have grabbed it
by accident

09:50.089 --> 09:52.387
after our
night of doing it.

09:53.192 --> 09:54.887
Take the freight elevator
to the sixth floor,

09:55.027 --> 09:56.255
and I'll be right down.

09:56.395 --> 09:58.590
Are you all right?

09:58.731 --> 10:00.096
Well, last night, I...

10:01.067 --> 10:01.999
Never mind.

10:02.134 --> 10:04.932
These Verizon Wireless phones
are just so popular,

10:05.071 --> 10:07.767
I accidentally grabbed one
belonging to an acquaintance.

10:07.907 --> 10:09.738
Well, sure, 'cause that
Verizon Wireless service

10:09.875 --> 10:10.807
is just unbeatable.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.467
If I saw
a phone like that on TV,

10:12.612 --> 10:15.445
I would be like, "Where is
my nearest retailer so I can...

10:15.581 --> 10:16.707
get one?"

10:16.849 --> 10:18.476
Can we have our money now?

10:19.452 --> 10:22.319
Come on, big money.

10:25.424 --> 10:27.085
Whoa.

10:27.226 --> 10:29.285
This ketchup expired
two years ago.

10:29.428 --> 10:31.658
Dude, how much
would I have to pay you

10:31.797 --> 10:32.821
to eat this whole bottle?

10:32.965 --> 10:34.330
Honestly?

10:34.467 --> 10:35.627
$1,000.

10:35.768 --> 10:37.201
$400.

10:44.977 --> 10:47.502
I got all the way to Harlem when I
heard Wagner coming from my phone.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.614
Harlem?

10:48.748 --> 10:50.545
I'm working out of the Clinton
offices for a few weeks.

10:50.683 --> 10:51.809
I'm helping Hillary retool

10:51.951 --> 10:53.316
her universal
healthcare platform.

10:53.452 --> 10:54.680
God, I want to kiss you
on the mouth

10:54.820 --> 10:56.788
to stop you from saying
such ridiculous things.

10:56.922 --> 10:58.617
Here's your phone.

10:58.758 --> 11:00.623
Obviously, we can never
be seen together again.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.022
Obviously.
I'm up for the Chairmanship,

11:02.161 --> 11:03.185
and I don't
want to risk that.

11:03.329 --> 11:04.455
They give you a helicopter,
you know.

11:04.597 --> 11:05.495
What about me?

11:05.631 --> 11:07.622
How can I look those little
orange children in the eye?

11:07.767 --> 11:10.600
They have no other documented
health problems, you know.

11:10.736 --> 11:11.998
They're orange!

11:12.138 --> 11:13.799
This is why
I got into politics.

11:13.939 --> 11:15.930
To stop big companies
from hurting the little guy.

11:16.075 --> 11:18.066
What happened to you
that made you this way?

11:19.612 --> 11:22.274
In 1998, I got shot in the face
by my neighbor's dog.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.076
Oh, C. C., I'm so...

11:24.216 --> 11:25.649
Wait, what?

11:25.785 --> 11:27.446
My neighbor had
a Riverton hunting rifle

11:27.586 --> 11:29.076
with a faulty trigger safety.

11:29.221 --> 11:31.781
One day his Jack Russell terrier
started chewing the area.

11:31.924 --> 11:33.448
The gun went off
and shot me in the face.

11:33.592 --> 11:35.025
No.

11:35.161 --> 11:36.059
A terrier?

11:36.195 --> 11:37.457
So, I did what was right.

11:37.596 --> 11:39.564
I sued Riverton,
my neighbor, and the dog.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.030
C. C., I'm so sorry.

11:41.167 --> 11:42.031
Well, don't be.

11:42.168 --> 11:43.760
After six
reconstructive surgeries,

11:43.903 --> 11:45.894
I'm much better looking now
than I used to be.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.699
Plus, they made
a Lifetime movie about me.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.239
Tonight on Lifetime,

11:49.375 --> 11:52.401
Candice Vandershark stars
as Celeste Cunningham in...

11:58.284 --> 12:01.048
You know, I thought
you made love like an ugly girl.

12:01.187 --> 12:03.052
So present, so grateful.

12:26.345 --> 12:27.437
Who was that?!

12:27.580 --> 12:28.239
Nobody.

12:28.380 --> 12:29.745
Don't lie to me, Jack.

12:29.882 --> 12:32.043
I've had plenty of women
mad at me the morning after.

12:32.184 --> 12:35.119
Just don't let her light your
sneakers on fire in the bathtub.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.881
She would never do that,
Tracy.

12:37.022 --> 12:38.421
She's a very special woman.

12:38.557 --> 12:39.922
So, then,
what's the problem?

12:40.059 --> 12:42.550
Well, we're just
on opposite sides of a feud.

12:42.695 --> 12:43.855
Oh, I get it.

12:43.996 --> 12:45.293
Romeo and Juliet.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.796
Capulets and Romulans.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.297
Mm-hmm.
I've been there.

12:48.434 --> 12:49.867
I'm black.
She's white.

12:50.002 --> 12:51.731
I'm black.
She's light-skin black.

12:51.871 --> 12:53.429
I'm black.
She's 17.

12:53.572 --> 12:54.732
Listen.

12:54.874 --> 12:57.240
If she's your soul mate,
you go for it.

12:57.376 --> 12:58.866
Tracy,
I don't believe in soul mates.

12:59.011 --> 13:01.809
I worked too hard to get where I
am to sacrifice it for some woman.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.915
I don't care
if she is beautiful, brilliant,

13:04.049 --> 13:05.949
and she does it
like her dad's a minister.

13:10.589 --> 13:12.887
Sir, that was impressive.

13:13.025 --> 13:15.653
My feet are puffed up
real bad.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.958
Dude, let us give you the rest
of the money for Donaghy's pants.

13:19.098 --> 13:20.429
No, Mr. Rossitano.

13:20.566 --> 13:23.501
We Parcells are neither wealthy
nor circumcised,

13:23.636 --> 13:24.933
but we are proud.

13:25.070 --> 13:26.901
I have to earn that money.

13:27.039 --> 13:29.030
All right,
I got a job for you.

13:29.175 --> 13:30.403
Every night after dinner,

13:30.543 --> 13:32.773
Lutz falls asleep on the couch
in our office...

13:32.912 --> 13:34.504
Mm-hmm.
Mm.

13:42.888 --> 13:44.355
Can I help you?

13:45.424 --> 13:47.756
Pete. Pete.

13:47.893 --> 13:48.882
Pete.

13:49.028 --> 13:51.019
Rahee-e-e-m!

13:51.163 --> 13:51.788
Ready to go?

13:51.931 --> 13:53.023
You guys are going out?

13:53.165 --> 13:54.029
Yeah.

13:54.166 --> 13:57.499
My buddy, Raheem, invited me
out with him to celebrate.

13:57.636 --> 13:59.797
He just completed some big
project he's been working on.

13:59.939 --> 14:03.568
Soon everyone will know
the name Raheem Haddad.

14:24.630 --> 14:26.598
Hi, I'm not sure, but...

14:26.732 --> 14:29.166
Who is he,
and where can we find him?

14:32.771 --> 14:33.703
Hey, C. C.

14:33.839 --> 14:35.329
<i>We're having
a barbecue tonight.</i>

14:35.474 --> 14:36.372
<i>You're welcome to come.</i>

14:36.508 --> 14:38.169
<i>Thanks!
Maybe I will.</i>

14:40.546 --> 14:42.309
Get the gun away from the dog.

14:42.448 --> 14:44.507
<i>Hey, hon, have you seen
my hunting rifle?</i>

14:44.650 --> 14:47.210
<i>Last time I saw it,
the dog had it.</i>

14:47.353 --> 14:48.684
What is wrong with you people?

14:52.057 --> 14:54.389
<i>I'm going to get into politics!</i>

15:14.680 --> 15:15.874
Got him!

15:17.349 --> 15:19.112
Ape attack!

15:19.251 --> 15:20.946
It's me... Kenneth!

15:21.720 --> 15:23.244
Oh, God! Oh!

15:23.389 --> 15:24.356
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:24.490 --> 15:25.752
Ape attack!

15:25.891 --> 15:27.188
Ape attack!

15:27.326 --> 15:28.793
Wake up!
It's Frank!

15:28.928 --> 15:30.088
Are you okay?

15:30.229 --> 15:32.220
Okay,
that went too far.

15:32.364 --> 15:34.855
I still need $700.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.092
What's next?

15:38.404 --> 15:40.338
You know that old lady
in Accounting

15:40.472 --> 15:42.565
who thinks you're her husband
who died in the war?

15:42.708 --> 15:44.335
What about her?

15:47.246 --> 15:48.873
<i>I do believe in destiny.</i>

15:49.014 --> 15:51.881
<i>And I know that
I should hate you, but I can't.</i>

15:52.017 --> 15:52.949
<i>I love you.</i>

15:53.085 --> 15:55.053
<i>And I don't care
what people say.</i>

15:55.187 --> 15:57.348
<i>We were meant to be
in each other's lives.</i>

16:01.460 --> 16:03.519
You're right, C. C.

16:07.566 --> 16:09.466
Some dudes took Raheem
last night.

16:09.601 --> 16:10.226
Huh.

16:10.369 --> 16:13.429
Sounds like an American hero saw
something and said something.

16:13.572 --> 16:16.541
Elizabeth Lemon,
I can't believe you did that.

16:16.675 --> 16:17.903
Raheem is a good guy.

16:18.043 --> 16:20.170
You seem to be defending Raheem
an awful lot.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.143
I'd hate to have to make
another phone call.

16:22.281 --> 16:23.441
Oh, no, we're cool.

16:23.582 --> 16:24.913
I renounce Raheem.

16:25.050 --> 16:27.280
Raheem is a bad guy.

16:27.419 --> 16:28.681
U. S. A. Number one!

16:32.057 --> 16:33.285
Tracy, I need your help.

16:33.425 --> 16:35.950
I've got to go somewhere and I can't
be seen and cabs don't go there.

16:36.095 --> 16:37.858
Sure.
Where is it?

16:37.997 --> 16:39.123
Clinton's office in Harlem.

16:39.264 --> 16:40.356
I know
where that building is.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.296
I get
my Jamaican meat pies there.

16:44.403 --> 16:46.769
Finally, my Scalp Rx.

16:50.909 --> 16:52.536
Oh, my God.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.309
<i>I am Raheem Haddad,</i>

16:59.451 --> 17:00.850
<i>and this is
my brother Hakim.</i>

17:00.986 --> 17:03.648
<i>And these are the reasons
you should choose us</i>

17:03.789 --> 17:05.551
<i>to be
the next contestants on...</i>

17:05.691 --> 17:07.056
<i>"The Amazing Race"!</i>

17:07.192 --> 17:08.318
Amazing what?

17:12.131 --> 17:13.689
Uh-oh.

17:13.832 --> 17:15.459
<i>We love to travel.</i>

17:15.601 --> 17:17.329
<i>Look at all the places
we have been.</i>

17:17.469 --> 17:23.031
<i>Toronto, Munich, London,
the Hoover Dam, the Cleve.</i>

17:23.876 --> 17:24.865
Oh, boy.

17:25.010 --> 17:28.275
<i>We are in good shape
for the roadblocks and detours.</i>

17:30.516 --> 17:31.574
Oh, no, oh, no.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.014
<i>We love America!</i>

17:35.154 --> 17:37.247
Oh, no.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.016
Oh, no.

17:41.360 --> 17:44.295
Jonathan,
I purchased a replacement pair

17:44.430 --> 17:45.692
of Mr. Donaghy's pants.

17:45.831 --> 17:46.798
Wow.

17:46.932 --> 17:48.923
You must love him
as much as I do.

18:05.217 --> 18:07.811
C. C., look out the window
onto 125th street.

18:10.255 --> 18:11.415
You shouldn't be here.

18:11.557 --> 18:14.025
I know I shouldn't. I can't help
myself. I want to be with you.

18:14.159 --> 18:15.592
Tell her
that you want your privates

18:15.727 --> 18:17.024
and her privates
to do a high five.

18:17.162 --> 18:18.288
Okay, Tray, I got this.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.159
Jack, we hardly
know each other.

18:20.299 --> 18:23.132
This could be career suicide
for both of us, and you know it.

18:23.268 --> 18:24.360
I don't care anymore.

18:24.503 --> 18:27.370
I saw your movie. What you said
to that dog about soul mates.

18:27.506 --> 18:29.064
I think
I might be that dog.

18:30.175 --> 18:33.303
Tell her her butt looks like an
apple, and you want to take a bite.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.436
Buzz me in.
Okay?

18:35.581 --> 18:37.139
Tell her she got
some tig ol' bitties like

18:37.282 --> 18:38.613
the Dallas Cowboy
cheerleaders.

18:38.750 --> 18:41.344
Tell her you want her to donate her
body to science, and you science!

18:41.487 --> 18:42.454
Tell her, Jack!

18:43.722 --> 18:46.247
I've been going crazy
these last few days,

18:46.391 --> 18:48.018
thinking about
our night together.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.628
How you wanted
to brush my hair as foreplay.

18:50.762 --> 18:53.230
How you made me that
western omelette at 4:00 a. m.

18:53.365 --> 18:55.265
I never met anyone
like you, Jack.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.662
Be with me, C. C.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.032
We'll ignore our differences
till the sex goes bad.

18:59.171 --> 19:01.571
Then we'll walk away
bitter and angry.

19:03.408 --> 19:04.841
Nobody can know
we're together,

19:04.977 --> 19:06.638
not even your friend
Tracy Jordan out there.

19:06.778 --> 19:08.439
I don't think you have to worry
about Tracy.

19:08.580 --> 19:10.514
Stop eating people's
old french fries, pigeon.

19:10.649 --> 19:13.516
Have some self-respect.
Don't you know you can fly?

19:19.625 --> 19:21.490
I've never had
a secret affair before.

19:26.398 --> 19:29.731
What do you say we go find
a spot and defile this place?

19:40.913 --> 19:41.777
Raheem!

19:41.914 --> 19:43.040
Hey, buddy!

19:43.182 --> 19:44.479
Where you been all week?

19:44.616 --> 19:47.312
They put electrodes
on my testicles, Liz.

19:47.452 --> 19:48.384
Who did?

19:48.520 --> 19:51.011
Oh, you remembered my name.

19:51.156 --> 19:53.852
America's government
shocked my nuts.

19:53.992 --> 19:55.391
No, I'm pretty sure

19:55.527 --> 19:57.222
they're not allowed
to do that type of thing.

19:57.362 --> 20:00.422
They say, "Raheem,
why you no shake hands?"

20:00.566 --> 20:03.399
I said, "'Cause I don't want
sickness before 'Amazing Race. "'

20:03.535 --> 20:05.765
They say, "Raheem, why all
the trips to the airport?"

20:05.904 --> 20:08.065
I say, "Because I'm practicing
for 'The Amazing Race'!"

20:08.207 --> 20:11.040
And then, "Zzzzt! Zzzzt!"
In my underpanties.

20:11.176 --> 20:13.906
Do you have any idea
who turned you in?

20:14.046 --> 20:15.206
No.

20:15.347 --> 20:17.975
I am just so angry now.

20:18.116 --> 20:20.107
I have so much anger inside.

20:20.252 --> 20:23.710
I want to do something
spectacular with it!

20:27.859 --> 20:29.121
Northrax.

20:30.195 --> 20:31.856
Hey!
I made waffles.

20:31.997 --> 20:33.464
Thank God.

20:33.599 --> 20:34.998
Yeah.
