WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:03.869
Hey. Uh, where'd you get
these burritos?

00:03.871 --> 00:05.137
From the spot on the corner?

00:05.139 --> 00:06.839
Mmm.
Yeah, the spot on the corner.

00:06.841 --> 00:08.507
You know I helped a lady
give birth in the kitchen?

00:08.509 --> 00:09.942
Ugh.

00:09.944 --> 00:11.610
NICK:
That's disgusting.

00:13.848 --> 00:16.615
A baby in the middle
of the place.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.951
I knew that wasn't
going to stop you.

00:18.953 --> 00:21.286
Disgusting. You didn't tell
us you delivered a baby.

00:21.288 --> 00:23.055
Baby's perfectly fine.

00:23.057 --> 00:26.325
But let's just say
I did not do a good job.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.994
(door closes)
WINSTON: Oh, Reagan. What's up?

00:28.996 --> 00:31.663
Hey. So, uh, I just
jogged past a guy

00:31.665 --> 00:33.565
that's offering
donkey rides for $50.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.868
Feel like that's too much
for a donkey ride, right?

00:35.870 --> 00:37.870
NICK (mouth full):
It's a dog, not a donkey.

00:37.872 --> 00:40.672
I know that guy.
His name is...

00:40.674 --> 00:42.241
His name is Stan.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.209
Stan. S-T-A-N.

00:44.211 --> 00:46.311
His dog's name's Cheerio.

00:46.313 --> 00:47.379
Hold on.

00:52.887 --> 00:54.486
It's not a donkey.

00:54.488 --> 00:55.888
Um, it's a dog.

00:55.890 --> 00:56.955
Okay.

00:58.225 --> 00:59.758
(sighs)
That was painful, Nick.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.593
It's like watching Cece
make a bed.

01:01.595 --> 01:04.063
(Cece humming a tune)

01:09.870 --> 01:11.437
Just give me the sheet!

01:11.439 --> 01:13.906
I can't be normal around Reagan.

01:13.908 --> 01:15.741
She's too hot
and mysterious.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.576
I mean, I haven't peed
in four days,

01:17.578 --> 01:21.146
which is alarming because I have
been drinking constantly.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.051
Yep. Nothing.

01:26.053 --> 01:27.553
The fact of the matter is,

01:27.555 --> 01:29.588
is that she don't want
to hang out with us.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.557
She's our roommate, but she
being straight up discourteous.

01:31.559 --> 01:35.694
Reagan, why don't you
join the fiesta, huh?

01:35.696 --> 01:37.129
I'll make up
a pitcher of margaritas.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.464
That's tempting, but, uh,

01:38.466 --> 01:40.032
if I have one margarita,
I'll have eight;

01:40.034 --> 01:41.800
and if I have eight,
end up riding that donkey

01:41.802 --> 01:43.602
all the way to Santa Monica,
so...

01:43.604 --> 01:46.071
(laughing): It'd be great
to watch you ride a donkey!

01:46.073 --> 01:48.207
Thanks, but no, thanks.
NICK: There's extra toilet paper

01:48.209 --> 01:50.209
in the bathroom! It's...
(door opens and closes)

01:50.211 --> 01:52.044
Are you hiding
toilet paper again?

01:52.046 --> 01:54.146
I can't do this. Did she
hit us with a "No, thanks"?

01:54.148 --> 01:57.049
How about this? No, thanks,
to your "No, thanks."

01:57.051 --> 01:58.317
Here's what I'm gonna do--

01:58.319 --> 02:00.052
I'm gonna make her
hang out with us

02:00.054 --> 02:01.987
whether she wants to or not.

02:01.989 --> 02:05.290
Oh, yeah, this woman just made
my nonsexual to-do list.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.459
You have a sexual to-do list?
Cece, don't ask.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.161
Number one...
I regret it already.

02:09.163 --> 02:10.662
Joan Allen.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.531
♪ ♪

02:18.439 --> 02:22.274
Oh! Nick! She's back in the kitchen!
She's back in the kitchen!

02:22.276 --> 02:25.077
Nick, we're making sex.
It hasn't started yet.

02:25.079 --> 02:27.312
It's not sex until you put
the straw in the coconut.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.981
It's called foreplay, you tween.

02:28.983 --> 02:30.849
You don't just buy
a Porsche off the lot and

02:30.851 --> 02:32.985
immediately enter it in the
<i> Groser Preis von Deutschland.</i>

02:32.987 --> 02:35.120
What? The<i> Groser Preis</i>
<i> von Deutschland.</i>

02:35.122 --> 02:37.523
Just let me eat in here. I don't
want to eat around Reagan.

02:37.525 --> 02:40.159
Why not? Oh, I
forgot that you're

02:40.161 --> 02:42.661
a bear in pants. Will you
please go eat in your room?

02:42.663 --> 02:44.863
She's right across the hall.
She'll hear the crunching!

02:44.865 --> 02:46.598
We need you elsewhere, Nick.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.100
From my cold, dead hands!

02:48.102 --> 02:49.868
That doesn't even apply.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.037
Reagan! (laughs)

02:52.039 --> 02:54.506
Ooh, what a coincidence.
We're both running!

02:54.508 --> 02:58.277
And I've been chasing you
for miles like a murderer!

02:58.279 --> 03:00.312
I kind of prefer to run alone.
You see?

03:00.314 --> 03:02.347
That's your problem
right there.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.683
We're roommates now,
and in our loft,

03:04.685 --> 03:07.319
we do things together,
like a family.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.655
Ooh, look. A bubbler.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.623
Oh. Oh.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.325
(slurping loudly)

03:13.327 --> 03:16.862
Oh, that's so good! Mmm.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.565
There's a Band-Aid in there.
WOMAN: Reagan?

03:20.734 --> 03:23.335
Camilla. Oh, my God. Hi.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.404
Why did I think
you were still in Atlanta?

03:25.406 --> 03:28.307
Oh, because last night
you sent me a text

03:28.309 --> 03:29.841
saying, "Still in Atlanta."

03:29.843 --> 03:33.178
Well, hello. What
have we here?

03:33.180 --> 03:34.980
Back on the stick, I see.
No, no, no.

03:34.982 --> 03:38.016
No. No. I'm just staying
with him and his roommates.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.017
Yeah, which is exactly
why you got to start

03:39.019 --> 03:40.752
hanging out with us more.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.721
You know, we only got you for a month.
I get you for a whole month?

03:42.723 --> 03:45.457
I'm about to start
binge-watching Ken Burns's<i> Jazz.</i>

03:47.561 --> 03:51.430
Oh,<i> Ken</i> Burns's<i> Jazz.</i> (whoops)

03:51.432 --> 03:52.998
Call you later. I will.
Do that.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.733
Call me, yes. Okay, great.
I'm going to. Okay.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.335
Great.
Can't wait.

03:56.337 --> 03:59.171
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?

03:59.173 --> 04:01.607
I am hooking up with her.
I'm dating her a little bit,

04:01.609 --> 04:03.675
but I'm over it,
and I'm trying to avoid her.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.944
What are you telling people
I'm here for a month for?

04:05.946 --> 04:07.446
Oh, you see what we're
doing right now?

04:07.448 --> 04:08.914
We're vibing, we're
talking about stuff!

04:08.916 --> 04:10.682
Okay, now it's my turn.
Let me do you.

04:10.684 --> 04:13.051
Um... I think I swallowed
a Band-Aid earlier.

04:13.053 --> 04:14.686
Now I have to dump her,
and I have never

04:14.688 --> 04:16.255
dumped anybody before.
I don't know how.

04:16.257 --> 04:19.725
I travel so much that I
usually just disappear.  Wow.

04:19.727 --> 04:22.628
Okay. I will help
you break up with her.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.563
Why? 'Cause you've been dumped,
like, a million times?

04:24.565 --> 04:26.698
No. Because I'm your roommate,
and we have each other's backs.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.734
Wait a minute.
What makes you think

04:28.736 --> 04:30.302
I've been dumped a lot?
Please.

04:30.304 --> 04:31.870
I read you guys
the moment I got there.

04:31.872 --> 04:34.306
Nick's deal is,
he honest-to-God might be 50.

04:34.308 --> 04:37.542
Schmidt's deal is he had
to Shazam "Stairway to Heaven."

04:37.544 --> 04:39.444
And your deal is
you've been dumped a lot.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.246
You're pretty good.
You're pretty good.

04:41.248 --> 04:42.581
SCHMIDT:
<i> How did Nick go through</i>

04:42.583 --> 04:44.750
so many napkins,
yet get salsa everywhere?

04:44.752 --> 04:48.120
We've got no privacy, and it
has been way, way, way too long

04:48.122 --> 04:50.055
since Mama got her biscuits.

04:50.057 --> 04:52.758
And the biscuits... are rising.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.926
I hope they stick to the
pan and get a little brown

04:54.928 --> 04:57.262
on the bottom.
I'm gonna be honest.

04:57.264 --> 04:59.231
That went right over my head.
I just didn't get it.

04:59.233 --> 05:00.799
I don't know... I don't know
where you're going with it.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.301
Plus, I can't concentrate.
It's filthy in here.

05:02.303 --> 05:04.736
How do we keep Nick out
of here?! He thinks that

05:04.738 --> 05:07.239
Reagan is some sort
of superhuman goddess.

05:07.241 --> 05:09.241
Okay, well, the truth of the
matter is, is I kind of get it.

05:09.243 --> 05:11.510
You know, when we first met,
I had to pretend that all kinds

05:11.512 --> 05:13.612
of things were wrong with you
just so I wouldn't freak out.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.814
You know, like, I gave you
a glass eye for a while.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.983
You had a wooden foot
for a short period of time.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.351
There was one week
where I pretended

05:19.353 --> 05:20.919
that you were a Democrat.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.021
I am a Democrat.
(laughing)

05:23.023 --> 05:25.524
Ah, that's so funny.
I love you.  Okay.

05:25.526 --> 05:28.360
So we tell Nick she has a glass eye.
He'll spin out.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.962
He'll think the eye is
a government-issued camera

05:30.964 --> 05:32.464
taking pictures for Langley.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.599
(scoffs)
Nick's a conspiracy theorist.

05:34.601 --> 05:36.368
It's like an Irish
carnival up there--

05:36.370 --> 05:38.937
just potato peels,
broken rides, fiddle music,

05:38.939 --> 05:42.140
dreams left unfulfilled,
bloodied soccer jerseys,

05:42.142 --> 05:44.643
bunch of women
limping around named Moira.

05:44.645 --> 05:47.879
Okay. So all we have
to do is find a detail

05:47.881 --> 05:49.648
that won't make
him spin out. Easy.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.383
It'll be the opposite of easy.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.518
It will be difficult.
Oh.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.555
We need to come up with
something so smart, so nuanced,

05:56.557 --> 06:00.292
so... unexpected, so surgical,

06:00.294 --> 06:04.396
that only a genius
could think of it.

06:04.398 --> 06:05.964
Reagan wears a wig.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.066
What? Get out of here.
No, it's true.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.301
She-she told me.

06:09.303 --> 06:10.535
Oh, she told you?
Yeah.

06:10.537 --> 06:13.405
When?
Before.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.040
(scoffs)

06:15.042 --> 06:17.242
Well, the timing
definitely checks out.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.077
The only question is why.

06:19.079 --> 06:20.846
Personal, um, lady reasons.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.347
I don't want
to touch that.

06:22.349 --> 06:23.982
(blows through lips)

06:23.984 --> 06:25.984
"Reagan wears a wig."

06:25.986 --> 06:28.019
"Told you before."

06:28.021 --> 06:30.722
Yep.
"Because of lady stuff."

06:33.327 --> 06:35.360
Wow.

06:35.362 --> 06:37.062
I don't buy it.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.264
Doesn't make sense.

06:39.266 --> 06:42.334
We failed.
Patience. I know my boy.

06:42.336 --> 06:43.935
But, Schmidt...
I know my boy!

06:43.937 --> 06:45.570
Hey, Nick.

06:45.572 --> 06:48.573
Got to get busy living
or get busy dying. Heard.

07:03.724 --> 07:07.392
What are you doing? What are<i> you</i> doing
is the question. What are you doing?

07:07.394 --> 07:09.961
Were you just smelling my hair?
No. I'm just Nicky being Nicky.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.063
Sometimes I feel like
you're in one of those

07:12.065 --> 07:13.365
weird man-dog
body-switch movies.

07:13.367 --> 07:15.367
You like those, too? Neither?

07:15.369 --> 07:17.536
(door opens and closes)

07:17.538 --> 07:19.704
It's a wig.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.642
(yelling):
Doesn't make sense!

07:23.644 --> 07:25.377
What?

07:25.379 --> 07:26.645
(chuckles)

07:26.647 --> 07:27.979
Ding, ding.

07:27.981 --> 07:31.216
The biscuits are ready.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.051
Well, did you make
enough for Cousin Andy?

07:34.054 --> 07:36.321
S...

07:36.323 --> 07:38.390
I'm-I'm gonna tell you
the truth.

07:38.392 --> 07:40.058
I don't get that one, either.
Who the hell is Cousin Andy?

07:40.060 --> 07:42.027
I just made it up. Mmm.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.066
Reagan, I have been
broken up with

07:48.068 --> 07:50.268
so many times in so
many different places.

07:50.270 --> 07:53.905
Um, multiple parks, coffee
shops, uh, Santa's lap,

07:53.907 --> 07:56.408
Kitchen Stadium
on<i> Iron Chef,</i>

07:56.410 --> 07:58.143
airplanes
in economy,

07:58.145 --> 08:00.579
economy select, economy
comfort, platinum economy,

08:00.581 --> 08:02.314
all covered in butterflies...

08:02.316 --> 08:03.949
I feel like we have established
your credentials.

08:03.951 --> 08:07.252
Okay. So I'm Camilla.
Break up with me.

08:07.254 --> 08:09.654
(clears throat)

08:09.656 --> 08:11.756
(scoffs)
Camilla...

08:11.758 --> 08:13.024
Yes, baby. I love you so much.

08:14.528 --> 08:16.628
We have had a lot
of really good times together,

08:16.630 --> 08:20.432
and I just... Oh, my God. Oh, my
God, oh, my goodness, oh, my God!

08:20.434 --> 08:22.668
I knew this was comin'. Oh,
my God, oh, my goodness.

08:22.694 --> 08:23.702
What-what are you doing?

08:23.704 --> 08:25.308
Oh, no. Are you breaking up with me?
Why you hate me?

08:25.334 --> 08:26.037
Why you hate me so much?

08:26.039 --> 08:28.607
I don't... I don't hate you.
I don't hate you. Oh, my God,

08:28.609 --> 08:30.342
you don't? Oh, my goodness. So
you're not breaking up with me.

08:30.344 --> 08:31.877
We're gonna have such a
happy life together. I-I...

08:31.879 --> 08:33.478
I am. I am breaking up with you.
Oh, my God,

08:33.480 --> 08:35.213
you is breakin' up with me.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.349
Why you is breakin' up with me
and stuff?

08:37.351 --> 08:40.218
Yo, this is mad crazy. I'm
pregnant with your child. Okay.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.521
That isn't possible.
Yeah, his name is D'Lante.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.456
We would never
name our child that.

08:44.458 --> 08:46.024
Yeah. D-apostrophe-Lante.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.359
No, I can't...
Look, I can't do this.

08:47.361 --> 08:48.693
Look, I want you
to be happy. Here.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.128
Here's $80.
Wow. Really?

08:50.130 --> 08:51.463
You're just gonna bail?
Yeah.

08:51.465 --> 08:52.797
I suck at this, obviously.

08:52.799 --> 08:53.999
I don't want to hurt her.
Honey,

08:54.001 --> 08:55.333
sit down, sit down, sit down.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.202
Here.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.205
Why don't you just be honest

09:00.207 --> 09:01.806
about why you're breaking up
with her?

09:01.808 --> 09:03.542
I don't... know.

09:03.544 --> 09:06.545
I just feel like it's over.
Let me tell you

09:06.547 --> 09:08.547
about some reasons
why I've been broken up with.

09:08.549 --> 09:11.149
Um, "you're too nasty in bed,
Winston."

09:11.151 --> 09:14.753
Or "you remind me of my
brother, Winston." Or...

09:14.755 --> 09:17.556
or "Winston, you spend too much
time in the butterfly house."

09:17.558 --> 09:18.990
I have an idea.
Okay.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.759
What if you break up
with Camilla for me?

09:20.761 --> 09:23.061
I'm sorry, what? Because obviously
you understand how it feels,

09:23.063 --> 09:25.430
and you'll be much more gentle
and empathetic.

09:25.432 --> 09:27.198
What? No, that is
the exact opposite

09:27.200 --> 09:29.067
of what we're trying
to accomplish here.

09:29.069 --> 09:32.404
This is a very important
moment in your life.

09:32.406 --> 09:36.274
You see, you have the
ability to change,

09:36.276 --> 09:38.076
and that is what I find

09:38.078 --> 09:41.880
the most beautiful
about human beings.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.782
If you do it, I will do
a 20-minute roommate dinner.

09:43.784 --> 09:44.616
Okay, deal.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.053
I been thinking...
Damn it, Miller!

09:48.055 --> 09:51.222
Maybe Winston was right. How well
do we know this Reagan character?

09:51.224 --> 09:53.758
I mean, sure, she wears a wig.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.528
Not a big deal.
Or, let me ask you,

09:56.530 --> 09:57.762
is it a big deal?

09:57.764 --> 09:59.097
Ask yourself,

09:59.099 --> 10:01.533
what type of person wears a wig?

10:01.535 --> 10:03.301
A bald person?

10:03.303 --> 10:04.736
Sure.
I'll say so.

10:04.738 --> 10:07.205
They're bald.
Somebody hiding something?

10:07.207 --> 10:08.707
Definitely.
CECE: Okay, look.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.709
Maybe she's not hiding
anything, all right?

10:10.711 --> 10:12.711
Beyoncé, Beyoncé
wears wigs,

10:12.713 --> 10:14.779
and you would trust
Beyoncé with your life.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.414
Yeah, I'd trust Beyoncé
with my life.

10:16.416 --> 10:17.983
♪ Ride it with my surfboard ♪

10:17.985 --> 10:20.986
♪ Surfboard, surfboard ♪

10:20.988 --> 10:24.623
♪ Bringin' on that wood, oh,
baby, bringin' on that wood! ♪

10:24.625 --> 10:26.691
We be all night.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.095
We be all night.

10:30.097 --> 10:32.097
Nick, is it possible
that you are maybe

10:32.099 --> 10:34.132
overthinking this just
a little bit, okay?

10:34.134 --> 10:36.167
'Cause, look, Reagan is
a really good roommate.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.903
She's quiet, she pays,
she takes care of her room.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.071
Her room. That's it.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.172
Great thinking.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.807
That's why I love you.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.442
That's why.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.177
Not physically.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.013
Uh, but as a person.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.515
Like, um, it's not sexual.
I love you like a mother

10:50.517 --> 10:52.951
or a sister or a girlfriend.
It's not sexual.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.419
Her room!

10:54.421 --> 10:57.589
Come on, come on,
come on, come on. Oh!

10:57.591 --> 10:59.357
Jackpot.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.960
Ribbons!
Oh, these are probably Jess's.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.795
Nick, stop. You should
not be in here.

11:03.797 --> 11:06.931
I am learning so much
about you, Reagan.

11:06.933 --> 11:09.167
An Ohio State T-shirt.

11:09.169 --> 11:13.138
Cash from Canada.
It's Canadian cash.

11:13.140 --> 11:16.474
A picture of
a little boy.

11:16.476 --> 11:19.377
This woman is like an orange. You peel
a layer, there's another layer there.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.379
You're thinking of an onion.
An orange only has one layer.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.281
Oh, you poor thing.
Okay,

11:23.283 --> 11:24.783
someone has to put
everything back

11:24.785 --> 11:26.618
exactly like they found it.
Well, it clearly is

11:26.620 --> 11:29.220
gonna be me, 'cause I'm
the only one who can fold.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.855
Nick, what are you doing?

11:30.857 --> 11:32.957
I'm making a mess,
but I'm finding the truth.

11:32.959 --> 11:35.126
Okay, I'm gonna end this.
Nick, Reagan doesn't wear a wig.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.661
We made the whole thing up.
But I smelled it

11:36.663 --> 11:37.896
and I saw it. We
couldn't get you

11:37.898 --> 11:40.065
out of our room.
Why would you lie to me?

11:40.067 --> 11:42.167
Well, we wouldn't need to lie
to you if you would just talk

11:42.169 --> 11:43.635
to Reagan instead of
hiding out in my room

11:43.637 --> 11:45.170
with your cheap
Southwestern food.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.871
Talk to her? Like a
normal human being? Yes,

11:46.873 --> 11:48.206
that's exactly what I want you to do.
Yes. Mm-hmm.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.208
I have nothing in common
with that woman.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.877
She is a goddess who's descended
from the heavens.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.814
And I'm just a mud man
from the bowels of Chicago.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.916
Let's clean this place up,
and let's get out of here.

11:57.918 --> 12:00.919
She's gonna be home soon.
Wait.

12:03.657 --> 12:05.657
What are these?

12:05.659 --> 12:08.226
"Sarah Nevada"?
"Suzi Shimizu"?

12:08.228 --> 12:09.260
That's Reagan's face.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.029
These are fake I.D.'s.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.198
Fake I.D.'s?

12:13.200 --> 12:14.766
SCHMIDT:
Okay.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.568
It's f... it's fake
identification.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.536
You're damn right
it is, Jack.

12:18.538 --> 12:20.238
Okay.
Okay.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.073
Look, this is a little bit
weird, but I'm sure there's

12:22.075 --> 12:23.341
a perfectly reasonable
explanation for this.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.610
Maybe Nick is
onto something here, okay?

12:25.612 --> 12:28.046
Because how much do we
actually really know about her?

12:28.048 --> 12:30.181
Who has fake I.D.'s?
I'll tell  you who.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.684
Con men. Grifters.

12:32.686 --> 12:34.085
It's all starting
to make sense to me.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.454
Check this out.
Let me break this down for you.

12:36.456 --> 12:39.724
Okay? She and her bastard son...

12:39.726 --> 12:40.959
Or her nephew.
...who she had

12:40.961 --> 12:43.461
with the Ohio State professor,

12:43.463 --> 12:45.897
go town to town,
selling...

12:45.899 --> 12:47.632
let's say fake pills.

12:47.634 --> 12:51.035
Pills. Doctor. Pharmacy.
Whatever she does.

12:51.037 --> 12:52.704
To a bunch of
maple-sucking

12:52.706 --> 12:54.272
tree huggers.

12:54.274 --> 12:58.610
Aka those lovely stoners
from the north,

12:58.612 --> 13:00.712
our Canadian brothers
and sisters.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.950
Let's just clean this place up, and
let's get out of here.  (chuckles)

13:05.952 --> 13:09.387
(door opens) REAGAN: Guys! Winston
made me bring home dinner.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.623
It's Reagan.
Or is it Suzi?

13:11.625 --> 13:13.391
Oh, Jewish God, why do you
hate me? Clean up the floor!

13:13.393 --> 13:14.459
Okay, yeah.
She is the one

13:14.461 --> 13:16.127
who has to explain herself.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.396
Let her come in here.
You have gone full Nick, Cece.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.064
What does that mean?
She's bought into your nonsense!

13:20.066 --> 13:21.833
Enough. I'm very disappointed
with you.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.835
Put this down. I'll-I'll fold it.
I just picked it up!

13:23.837 --> 13:25.303
You don't know
what you're doing.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.738
Hey, Reagan, come in here!
No, no, Reagan!

13:26.740 --> 13:28.406
Don't come in here! There's
a possum  in here!

13:28.408 --> 13:29.474
Don't come in here,
'cause there's...

13:37.150 --> 13:38.783
What do you mean, Reagan wants
to break up with me?

13:38.785 --> 13:39.984
Who are you?

13:39.986 --> 13:41.352
I'm her roommate.
Oh, so she sent

13:41.354 --> 13:43.755
her roommate
to break up with me?

13:43.757 --> 13:45.957
Now I have no more questions.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.693
Great. Then I'm out. Blessings.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.533
Okay, look, um,

13:55.535 --> 13:58.136
I know this
is not ideal.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.771
But if I'm being honest,
she's got a lot

13:59.773 --> 14:01.506
of work to do emotionally.
Are you really

14:01.508 --> 14:03.141
gonna let her get away
with this?

14:03.143 --> 14:05.643
You must know
how this makes me feel.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.946
You've clearly been dumped
many times.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.781
Why do people keep saying that?

14:09.783 --> 14:10.782
You ordered a Shirley Temple.

14:10.784 --> 14:12.116
It's a virgin Denzel.

14:12.118 --> 14:13.484
If she wants to dump me,

14:13.486 --> 14:15.620
she should man up
and look me in the eye.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.822
You know what, she should have,
and I told her that.

14:17.824 --> 14:19.157
It's the least
she could have done.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.558
Hey, you're preaching
to the choir.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.360
Ask me how many times
I've been dumped.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.663
I don't have the... 47 times.
And once on my birthday.

14:25.665 --> 14:28.066
And out of that 47 times
and once on my birthday,

14:28.068 --> 14:29.968
do you know what part hurts
the most?

14:29.970 --> 14:32.170
Getting bailed on.
Getting bailed on.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.639
Why do people think
they can just disappear on you?

14:34.641 --> 14:36.474
They're not thinking at all.
Except of themselves.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.243
Let's go find her.

14:38.245 --> 14:40.478
Hell yeah. Ooh, wait, wait,
wait, I just thought about it,

14:40.480 --> 14:42.380
and that's not a good idea.
Where is she?

14:42.382 --> 14:43.648
How you... how you know
I know where she at?

14:43.650 --> 14:45.650
You said you're roommates.

14:45.652 --> 14:46.885
Damn.

14:46.887 --> 14:49.420
Bitten by my own snake.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.489
So you all went through my room
and you each have things

14:51.491 --> 14:53.024
that you would like to discuss.
Is that correct?

14:53.026 --> 14:54.993
That's true. Yes. Chicago.

14:54.995 --> 14:57.528
So-- the money,
the fake I.D.'s.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.264
I have fake I.D.'s
because hospitals hate

14:59.266 --> 15:01.165
pharmaceutical reps
and it gets me through the door.

15:01.167 --> 15:03.568
I carry Canadian cash because
I do a lot of business there

15:03.570 --> 15:05.203
and I don't trust banks.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.237
Who does?

15:06.239 --> 15:07.906
Okay.
All right, fine.

15:07.908 --> 15:11.509
What about this, though--
your son?

15:11.511 --> 15:13.411
He looks just like you.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.179
That is me.
Wait. What?

15:15.181 --> 15:18.049
Oof. Rough haircut. Oh, and if
you found something in my room

15:18.051 --> 15:19.851
that kind of looks like
a hollowed-out hand,

15:19.853 --> 15:21.786
that's a glove.

15:21.788 --> 15:24.289
(clears throat) So I went full Nick, huh?
Yes, you went full Nick.

15:24.291 --> 15:25.790
Right, yeah,
I see that now.

15:25.792 --> 15:28.259
I'm full Nick every day.
Imagine how that feels.

15:28.261 --> 15:32.463
We all owe you an apology for...
pretty much everything.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.399
I'm sorry that
we went through your room.

15:34.401 --> 15:36.034
Well, that's not
what I'm upset about. I mean,

15:36.036 --> 15:37.735
I went through all of your rooms
when I first moved in.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.270
Excuse me? Wait, you
went through <i> our</i> rooms?

15:39.272 --> 15:41.306
Oh, no. How else am I
supposed to get to know you?

15:41.308 --> 15:43.107
But the point is I didn't
jump to conclusions.

15:43.109 --> 15:46.044
I mean, Nick has a two-by-four
in his room with a nail in it.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.879
I didn't assume
he was building a human cage.

15:47.881 --> 15:49.314
I'm building a tree house.

15:49.316 --> 15:50.882
You're doing wha...
you're building a tree house?

15:50.884 --> 15:53.084
Well, why am I not involved?
Why is Cece not involved?

15:53.086 --> 15:54.652
We want to be involved.
Oh, I'm involved.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.220
So's Winston.
What?

15:56.222 --> 15:58.556
Everyone's involved
in the tree house but I?

15:58.558 --> 16:00.825
Forget about it.
Reagan, how would you like

16:00.827 --> 16:02.727
to build a tree house with me?
No.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.629
Reagan, we already got plans,
we already got a two-by-four.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.564
No. I feel like we are
really off-topic here.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.099
What I'm trying to say is:

16:08.101 --> 16:10.001
Why did you just assume
that I'm a criminal?

16:10.003 --> 16:13.471
Well, because these two
are paranoid maniacs.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.507
Who apparently are building
a tree house together.

16:16.509 --> 16:18.009
Not apparently.  We are.
Mm-hmm.

16:18.011 --> 16:20.144
On the other hand,

16:20.146 --> 16:21.813
we hardly know
anything about you.

16:21.815 --> 16:24.148
Oh, my God. Okay,
that's what this is about?

16:24.150 --> 16:26.250
Look, I'm-I'm only gonna
be here for a few weeks.

16:26.252 --> 16:28.186
There is no reason to get
all emotionally involved.

16:28.188 --> 16:31.022
Let's just keep it clean,
and that way nobody gets upset.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.424
I am so upset right now.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.026
WINSTON: Uh, let me get
ahead of this, roomie.

16:35.028 --> 16:37.862
I did not help out today.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.335
Camilla.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.536
Hi, baby, hi.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.472
What are you doing here?
Cut the crap.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.640
Why?
You sent him to dump me?

16:49.642 --> 16:52.310
No. (scoffs)
To dump you?

16:52.312 --> 16:54.812
No. Why would I do that...
Why would you do that?

16:54.814 --> 16:56.180
NICK: What the hell, man?
CECE: That is crazy.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.382
Why would anyone do that?

16:57.384 --> 16:58.883
What's wrong with you?

16:58.885 --> 17:00.151
(quietly): Tell the truth,
you sneaky woman.

17:00.153 --> 17:02.186
Reagan, are you
dumping me or not?

17:02.188 --> 17:03.454
No.

17:06.559 --> 17:07.925
Kind of.

17:08.895 --> 17:11.662
Look, Camilla, I, uh...

17:11.664 --> 17:13.765
I don't want to...
I don't want to hurt you.

17:15.001 --> 17:16.968
Just say it.

17:19.005 --> 17:21.139
Okay.
(clears throat)

17:21.141 --> 17:23.207
The truth is...

17:26.980 --> 17:28.579
...that I'm a criminal.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.581
What?
I'm a criminal.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.650
You shouldn't be with me.
I'm disgusting.

17:32.652 --> 17:33.885
Things I've done.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.586
Things I'm
capable of.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.255
Hard life, short life--
I probably won't live that long.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.389
I can't believe this.

17:40.527 --> 17:41.726
She's a criminal.

17:41.728 --> 17:42.727
Filthy.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.996
Disgusting crimes.

17:44.998 --> 17:47.732
One of the worst human beings I've
ever met in my life. And who are you?

17:47.734 --> 17:49.200
I'm her,
uh, co-criminal.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.702
Co-gangster.
We run the streets together.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.704
From Bangkok to Chicago
to here.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.273
Just murdering people.

17:55.275 --> 17:57.542
My name is Nick. On the
streets, they call me, uh...

17:57.544 --> 17:59.243
Sharky.
Sharky, that's right.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.612
'Cause I attack
from beneath up.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.414
CECE:
It's all true, Camilla.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.950
And her name is not Reagan.

18:05.952 --> 18:08.119
It's Suzi Shimizu.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.923
You're Japanese?
Very much so.

18:11.925 --> 18:14.058
We happen... we happen
to all be Japanese.

18:14.060 --> 18:17.895
The unlucky offspring of a
couple very lucky American GIs.

18:17.897 --> 18:19.197
Unnecessary backstory.
Yeah, they call me

18:19.199 --> 18:20.565
the Moyel on the streets,

18:20.567 --> 18:21.899
'cause I will, uh...
(clicks tongue)

18:21.901 --> 18:23.768
...cut your penis off.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.436
Isn't that right, Sharky?
You're on your own, Moyel.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.271
And they call me Cece,

18:27.273 --> 18:31.142
but spelled S-I-S-I,

18:31.144 --> 18:34.245
with an accent
over the last I.

18:34.247 --> 18:36.581
I am spinning out here, Moyel.
You got to help me.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.983
Why don't you go spin all
the way over to your tree house?

18:38.985 --> 18:41.319
Schmidt knows about the tree house?
Okay, what the hell is going on?

18:41.321 --> 18:43.287
Winston, check for a wire--
she could be a rat.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.756
Stop it.
This isn't real.

18:45.758 --> 18:48.126
You're telling us we're not
a Japanese crime family?

18:48.128 --> 18:50.995
Reagan, tell me the truth.
Reagan, seriously,

18:50.997 --> 18:52.830
just stop bailing.

18:57.770 --> 19:00.171
I'll just go.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.142
Camilla, wait.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.778
Look...

19:07.780 --> 19:09.847
(exhales)

19:11.251 --> 19:13.484
This isn't working out.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.587
But I think that it's my fault.

19:16.589 --> 19:19.023
Because I don't let people in.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.793
I'm sorry.

19:22.795 --> 19:26.397
I think that you deserve
a lot better than that.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.967
Thank you.

19:29.969 --> 19:32.370
I know that wasn't easy for you.

19:38.611 --> 19:41.279
Okay, well, I'm gonna take off.

19:43.650 --> 19:46.317
Do you, um, still have
my blue sweater? Yes.

19:46.319 --> 19:47.534
Oh, no, no, no... Uh,
it's right in my room.

19:47.560 --> 19:48.652
Right here, in the first door.

19:48.654 --> 19:50.521
Right there. Okay, thanks.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.623
WINSTON: Oh, no, no.
NICK: That's nice.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.158
Telling the truth works.

19:54.160 --> 19:55.793
SCHMIDT:
Yeah, it did.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.195
CECE: Good job. Wait,
wait, wait, wait for it.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.330
CAMILLA: Freaking bitch!
(crashing)

19:59.332 --> 20:01.732
I hate you!
I hate you so much!

20:01.734 --> 20:03.367
Oh.
Yeah, it's the old

20:03.369 --> 20:05.536
"I left my sweater" trick.
(Camilla roaring)

20:05.538 --> 20:07.004
Let me tell you
something, folks,

20:07.006 --> 20:08.573
I've played that
song before.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.174
All right, well, this
obviously turned out to be

20:10.176 --> 20:11.909
a huge disaster.
I hate you so much!

20:11.911 --> 20:14.011
But... thank you. Try sleeping
on an upside down bed!

20:14.013 --> 20:15.146
I'm proud of you.

20:15.148 --> 20:16.714
All of you--
I mean, you guys

20:16.716 --> 20:18.549
could've bailed on me,
but you didn't.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.151
You stuck around,
and you helped me

20:20.153 --> 20:21.485
lie to a psychotic woman

20:21.487 --> 20:23.421
who is now destroying
all of my stuff.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.323
(Camilla yells)

20:25.325 --> 20:26.724
Anything to help.
It's kind of what we do.

20:26.726 --> 20:30.194
It's how we roll.
(Camilla shrieks)

20:30.196 --> 20:32.563
How do you think she's taking it?
What's with all these ribbons?!

20:32.565 --> 20:33.731
How long do you think
she's gonna be in there?

20:33.733 --> 20:35.166
I like to do about 15.

20:35.168 --> 20:37.535
CAMILLA: You are never
gonna forget me!

20:37.537 --> 20:40.671
You are never gonna
forget Camilla!

20:40.673 --> 20:42.773
So, what'd you bring us
for dinner?

20:42.775 --> 20:44.175
CECE:
<i> How about this one?</i>

20:44.177 --> 20:48.879
Are you ready to...
soak Mama's beans?

20:48.881 --> 20:50.581
It's working, right?
Okay, shh. I love you.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.750
Yeah, I love you, too. I love you.
Let's not talk.

20:52.752 --> 20:53.751
Okay.

20:53.753 --> 20:54.752
(grunting)

20:54.754 --> 20:56.754
Nick!

20:56.756 --> 20:58.689
What?
You still can't eat

20:58.691 --> 21:00.057
in front of Reagan?
This has nothing to do

21:00.059 --> 21:01.692
with Reagan.
I... I've just gotten

21:01.694 --> 21:03.694
used to eating in here.
It's cozy.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.363
Why, what are you guys up to?

21:05.365 --> 21:07.465
What?
(knock at door)

21:07.467 --> 21:10.034
Can I come in?
My room is trashed.

21:10.036 --> 21:11.369
This is where we eat, right?

21:11.371 --> 21:13.204
Yes, please, please, please.

21:13.206 --> 21:14.705
Might as well.
I mean, sure, why not?

21:22.582 --> 21:23.814
What?

21:23.816 --> 21:25.383
I like the way
you eat a burrito.

21:25.385 --> 21:26.417
Thanks.

21:26.419 --> 21:27.418
You're welcome.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.320
<i> Buenos noches!</i>

21:29.322 --> 21:30.921
(Winston speaking Spanish)

21:30.923 --> 21:32.089
Aah!
Oh!

21:32.091 --> 21:33.924
Winston!
Oh... oh...

21:33.926 --> 21:35.960
All over the bed?!

21:35.962 --> 21:37.561
WINSTON:<i> I didn't get</i>
<i> my</i> huevos<i> on you, did I?</i>

21:37.563 --> 21:38.996
SCHMIDT:<i> Close your robe! </i>
CECE:<i> Okay.</i>

21:38.998 --> 21:41.032
