♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:09.041 --> 00:12.000
RADIO CALL SAID HER PURSE WAS
STILL HANGING OFF HER SHOULDER.

00:12.041 --> 00:13.542
THEY FOUND SOME PLASTIC

00:13.583 --> 00:15.542
AND AN APPOINTMENT CARD
FOR DR. MONTGOMERY.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.542
(Addison)
OH, MY GOD. LAUREN.

00:17.583 --> 00:20.333
LAUREN, IT'S DR. MONTGOMERY.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

00:20.375 --> 00:22.959
22-YEAR-OLD PREGNANT FEMALE,
NEAR DROWNING.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.583
APNEIC AND HYPOTHERMIC
AT THE SCENE.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.583
SHE'S MY PATIENT--
LAUREN WOODS, 33 WEEKS.

00:26.625 --> 00:28.583
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED,
LAUREN, ANYTHING?

00:28.625 --> 00:31.041
COAST GUARD FISHED HER
OUT OF SANTA MONICA BAY.

00:31.083 --> 00:33.542
DID ANYBODY SEE ANYTHING?
ALREADY IN THE WATER
WHEN SHE WAS SPOTTED.

00:33.583 --> 00:36.166
MICHAEL? WHERE'S MICHAEL?
HOLD ON, LAUREN.
HANG IN THERE.

00:36.208 --> 00:39.458
(monitor beeping erratically)

00:39.500 --> 00:42.041
SHE'S IN V-TACH.
GET HER IN TRAUMA SURGERY TWO.

00:42.083 --> 00:44.041
ALL RIGHT, SOUNDS LIKE
CLASSIC V.S.D. CONSISTENT WITH

00:44.083 --> 00:46.041
A LARGE DEFECT BETWEEN
THE RIGHT AND LEFT VENTRICLES.

00:46.083 --> 00:48.542
THIS IS NEW?
NEVER THERE BEFORE.

00:48.583 --> 00:50.208
THE STRESS FROM THE ACCIDENT

00:50.250 --> 00:53.041
PROBABLY BLEW
THE UNDERLYING DEFECT OPEN.
(monitor beeping erratically)

00:53.083 --> 00:56.041
PULSE OX IS DROPPING.
HER LUNGS COLLAPSED.
NEEDS A CHEST TUBE.

00:56.083 --> 01:00.375
I GOT IT.
ALL RIGHT, PUT HER UNDER.
PREP FOR AN EMERGENCY C-SECTION.

01:00.417 --> 01:02.208

01:09.250 --> 01:11.792
SHE'S THROWING
MULTIPLE P.V.C.s
SHE'S BACK IN V-TACH.
CRASH CART.

01:11.834 --> 01:14.458
LOST HER PRESSURE.
ALL RIGHT. V-FIB.

01:14.500 --> 01:17.625
ADDISON, WE GOTTA GET
THAT BABY OUTTA THERE.
ALMOST.

01:17.667 --> 01:20.500
SHE'S IN CARDIAC ARREST.

01:45.125 --> 01:47.667
HE WRITES MY CHECKS. YOU?

01:47.709 --> 01:49.291
OH, NO.

01:49.333 --> 01:52.709
I USED TO LIKE PARTIES,
BUT NOW...

01:52.750 --> 01:55.041
I DON'T KNOW.
THE BIG CROWD...

01:55.083 --> 01:58.041
GUESS THAT'S ALL
PART OF THE CRAZY, HUH?

01:58.083 --> 02:00.041
AVOIDING DULL SPEECHES,

02:00.083 --> 02:02.041
BIG EGOS
AND DRUNKEN COLLEAGUES?

02:02.083 --> 02:03.750
MAYBE NOT SO CRAZY.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.583
ARE YOU BEING NICE TO ME?

02:11.750 --> 02:13.041
MAYBE.

02:13.083 --> 02:14.709
A LITTLE.

02:14.750 --> 02:17.041
(motor whirring)

02:17.083 --> 02:18.291
MORNING.

02:18.333 --> 02:20.166
MORNING.

02:22.208 --> 02:25.166
DID YOU GET A CHANCE TO LOOK
AT THE DATA I E-MAILED YOU

02:25.208 --> 02:29.083
ON MY, UH,
HUMAN CLONING PROJECT?

02:29.125 --> 02:30.542
HUMAN CLONING.

02:30.583 --> 02:33.041
I'VE DECIDED IT'S TIME
TO CLONE PEOPLE.

02:33.083 --> 02:36.000
YEAH, WELL,
I'M TRYING TO WORK.
WHICH IS ALL
YOU'VE BEEN DOING LATELY.

02:38.583 --> 02:41.750
IT'S EASIER HERE
THAN AT HOME.

02:41.792 --> 02:46.583
HOME IS LONELY,
AND, UH... WORK IS GOOD.

02:48.959 --> 02:51.041
YOU KNOW, I COULD HELP...

02:51.083 --> 02:53.750
WITH WORK MOSTLY.

02:53.792 --> 02:56.750
THE EMOTIONAL STUFF--
I'M A LITTLE CRIPPLED.

02:56.792 --> 02:57.625
(chuckles)

02:57.667 --> 02:59.667
(chuckles)

03:01.792 --> 03:03.375
THANK YOU.

03:03.417 --> 03:04.959
(footsteps approach)

03:05.000 --> 03:06.375
NAOMI.

03:06.417 --> 03:07.875
I, UH, I...

03:07.917 --> 03:10.750

03:10.792 --> 03:12.041
OH...
YES.

03:12.083 --> 03:14.667
NO. NO,
WE WERE JUST WORKING.

03:14.709 --> 03:18.041
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU
IN ADVANCE, FOR TONIGHT.

03:18.083 --> 03:20.000
I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT.

03:20.041 --> 03:22.750
WELL, I AM HONORED,
REALLY.

03:22.792 --> 03:24.542
SUCKING UP TO THE BOSS.

03:24.583 --> 03:26.750
NO, I AM PRESENTING WILLIAM
WITH HIS AWARD

03:26.792 --> 03:29.041
AT THE BALL TONIGHT.
YOU'RE COMING, RIGHT?

03:29.083 --> 03:31.625
GOT MY DANCING SHOES ON.
GOOD. (laughs) GOOD.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.625
ANYWAY, I JUST, UH...

03:36.667 --> 03:40.667
WANTED TO EXPRESS
MY GRATITUDE.

03:40.709 --> 03:44.375
I'M SURE YOUR SPEECH
WILL BE TREMENDOUS,

03:44.417 --> 03:47.041
IMPRESSIVE AS ALWAYS.

04:03.250 --> 04:05.709
(beeping continues)

04:05.750 --> 04:07.291
HOW'S LAUREN?

04:07.333 --> 04:10.041
UH, SHE'S SEDATED,
IN I.C.U.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.458
ECHO SHOWED A PERSISTENT
V.S.D. IN HER HEART.

04:12.500 --> 04:15.875
SHE NEEDS SURGERY, AND I CAN'T
DO THAT UNTIL SHE'S STABLE.

04:15.917 --> 04:19.875
HOW'S THE BABY?
HER LUNGS AREN'T MATURE ENOUGH.
SHE'S HAVING A HARD TIME.

04:19.917 --> 04:22.959
YOU WERE GOOD IN THERE
THIS MORNING.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.041
DID YOU GET IN CONTACT
WITH HER HUSBAND?

04:26.083 --> 04:28.709
I TRIED.

04:28.750 --> 04:30.667
OKAY, WELL, I'M GONNA GO
CHECK UP ON LAUREN

04:30.709 --> 04:33.333
AND THEN GO BACK
TO THE PRACTICE.

04:33.375 --> 04:35.625
SAM.

04:35.667 --> 04:38.625
CAN WE JUST...
WILL YOU TALK TO ME?

04:38.667 --> 04:44.000
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED
ON LAUREN.

04:45.959 --> 04:47.959
(Cooper)
"NO" IS NOT AN OPTION.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.041
ADDISON'S MEMO SAID
EVERYBODY GOES TO THE BALL.

04:50.083 --> 04:52.041
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'M GONNA
GO AHEAD AND PULL

04:52.083 --> 04:54.542
THE "WIFE DIED,
SINGLE PARENT CARD," SO...
(laughs)

04:54.583 --> 04:57.333
I'M OUT.
OH, I WAS ATTACKED.

04:57.375 --> 04:59.875
OH!
YOU MAY HAVE READ ABOUT IT?
YEAH, IT KINDA GIVES ME

04:59.917 --> 05:02.875
CARTE BLANCHE
TO IGNORE ALL MEMOS.
NO, NO, NO, NO. PEOPLE, YOU
KNOW, LIFE HAPPENS, WE MOVE ON.

05:02.917 --> 05:04.875
WE USE BIG,
GAUDY EVENTS LIKE THIS

05:04.917 --> 05:06.875
TO MOVE ON WITH OUR LIVES.

05:06.917 --> 05:09.500
ME? BROKE UP
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND.
(laughs)

05:09.542 --> 05:12.500
YEAH.
SMALL POTATOES, MAYBE,

05:12.542 --> 05:15.917
BUT I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD
TO GETTING OUT THERE AND...

05:15.959 --> 05:19.583
AND FORGETTING ABOUT
THE PAST.

05:19.625 --> 05:21.583
YOU EVER GONNA GROW UP?
OH, I HOPE NOT.

05:21.625 --> 05:24.542
I'M FEELING SO MUCH YOUNGER
AND FREER LATELY.

05:24.583 --> 05:26.417
YES. HEY, CAN YOU TELL
DELL AND VIOLET

05:26.458 --> 05:29.333
THAT THIS THING TONIGHT
IS A COMMAND PERFORMANCE?

05:29.375 --> 05:31.750
OH, IT IS. WE ALL GO.
WE'RE GONNA BRUSH OUR TEETH,

05:31.792 --> 05:34.166
WE'RE GONNA
PUT ON EXPENSIVE CLOTHES,

05:34.208 --> 05:36.166
WE'RE GONNA GO
TO THIS FANCY PARTY,

05:36.208 --> 05:38.500
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN.

05:38.542 --> 05:40.291
WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN, OKAY?

05:40.333 --> 05:42.625
YEAH, SO...

05:42.667 --> 05:45.542
SEE YOU THERE.

05:49.333 --> 05:51.000
HEY, SAM.

05:51.041 --> 05:54.125
SAM. ARE YOU OKAY?

05:54.166 --> 05:56.750
NO, I'M NOT OKAY.

05:56.792 --> 05:58.750
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO PLAN

05:58.792 --> 06:00.792
A PREGNANT
15 YEAR OLD'S WEDDING.

06:00.834 --> 06:04.041
THERE'S NO GUIDEBOOK.
I CHECKED.
WELL, IT'S A WEDDING.

06:04.083 --> 06:05.875
IT'S NOT TRADITIONAL, I KNOW,

06:05.917 --> 06:08.542
BUT HOPEFULLY IT'S
THE ONLY ONE SHE'LL HAVE.

06:08.583 --> 06:12.875
SHE--SHE JUST WANTS IT
TO BE SPECIAL.
NO, WHAT SHE WANTS
IS A FAIRY TALE.

06:12.917 --> 06:15.792
AND TO BE HONEST, I'M NOT
FEELING VERY HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.333
WELL, FIND A BALANCE.

06:17.375 --> 06:20.041
YOU KNOW,
NICE BUT NOT TOO BIG,

06:20.083 --> 06:22.375
EVERYTHING TASTEFUL,
ELEGANT, BUT...

06:22.417 --> 06:25.667
APPROPRIATE.

06:25.709 --> 06:27.458
WHAT?
YOU'RE HIRED.

06:27.500 --> 06:30.792
NO, SAM--
LOOK, MAYA'S GONNA COME OVER.
SHE'S GONNA DROP SOME STUFF OFF.

06:30.834 --> 06:33.458
YOU TAKE A LOOK AT IT, TELL ME
IF YOU THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.500
COULD YOU? PL--
OH, THANK YOU.

06:35.542 --> 06:37.083
THANK YOU.

06:39.542 --> 06:41.583
PAIGE...

06:41.625 --> 06:44.417
SAYS YOU'VE HAD A FEVER
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

06:44.458 --> 06:47.583
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AFFECTING
YOUR TEXTING FINGERS.

06:47.625 --> 06:50.792
THAT'S GOOD.
SORRY.

06:50.834 --> 06:53.792
HOW'S THE NEW SCHOOL?
IT SUCKED FOR A WHILE,
EATING ALONE EVERY DAY.

06:53.834 --> 06:57.041
BUT I HAVE A LOT
OF FRIENDS NOW, SO IT'S GOOD.
(beeps)

06:57.083 --> 06:58.583
GOOD. FRIENDS ARE GOOD.

06:58.625 --> 07:00.583
YOU DEFINITELY HAVE A FEVER.

07:00.625 --> 07:04.542
AND YOU LOOK...
A LITTLE YELLOWISH.

07:04.583 --> 07:06.709
LET'S LOOK
AT YOUR GLANDS.

07:06.750 --> 07:09.291
I JUST NEED
TO TAKE A LOOK.

07:09.333 --> 07:10.750
OKAY.

07:10.792 --> 07:12.375
OKAY.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.250
OH.

07:18.291 --> 07:20.250
HOW'D YOU GET THAT?

07:20.291 --> 07:23.291
UM, I DON'T KNOW. IT W--
IT WAS JUST THERE.

07:23.333 --> 07:25.291
IT LOOKS LIKE A BITE.

07:25.333 --> 07:28.500
YOU GOT A WILD LITTLE BROTHER
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT?

07:28.542 --> 07:30.458
IT WAS PROBABLY
MY CURLING IRON.

07:30.500 --> 07:33.500
I'VE BURNT MYSELF
WITH IT BEFORE.

07:33.542 --> 07:36.542
PAIGE,
DID SOMEBODY BITE YOU?

07:36.583 --> 07:39.500
NO. I'D KNOW
IF SOMEONE BIT ME.

07:45.792 --> 07:47.750
THE NURSE SAID
SHE'S COMING TO?

07:47.792 --> 07:49.750
IN AND OUT.
HER SATs ARE LOW.

07:49.792 --> 07:52.250
I WAS JUST ADJUSTING
HER OXYGEN.

07:52.291 --> 07:55.458
LAUREN. HEY.

07:55.500 --> 07:58.458
YOUR BABY WAS BORN.
IT'S A GIRL.

07:58.500 --> 08:01.125
HER LUNGS ARE WEAK,
BUT SHE'S HANGING IN THERE.

08:01.166 --> 08:04.291
I'M STILL WORKING ON HER,
OKAY?

08:04.333 --> 08:07.834
THE PRESSURE--
I CAN'T BREATHE.
OKAY.

08:07.875 --> 08:09.625
HI, LAUREN.
I'M DR. BENNETT.

08:09.667 --> 08:11.583
THE REASON
YOU'RE FEELING PRESSURE

08:11.625 --> 08:13.625
IS BECAUSE YOUR HEART
ISN'T PUMPING LIKE IT SHOULD.

08:13.667 --> 08:16.041
WE DISCOVERED A HOLE
IN BETWEEN YOUR TWO VENTRICLES.

08:16.083 --> 08:18.750
AS SOON AS YOU GET STRONGER,
I'LL DO SURGERY.

08:18.792 --> 08:21.000
WE CAN FIX THIS.
IS MICHAEL HERE?

08:21.041 --> 08:24.041
HAS... HE SEEN THE BABY?
WE HAVEN'T FOUND HIM YET.

08:24.083 --> 08:26.041
THE COAST GUARD IS STILL
SEARCHING THE WATER.

08:26.083 --> 08:28.041
WAS... WAS HE
IN A BOAT WITH YOU?

08:28.083 --> 08:31.041
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?

08:31.083 --> 08:33.041
LAUREN?

08:33.083 --> 08:34.375
NO.

08:34.417 --> 08:37.709
HE...

08:37.750 --> 08:39.208
LEFT.

08:39.250 --> 08:43.000
HE TOLD ME HE DIDN'T LOVE ME
AND HE LEFT.

08:43.041 --> 08:46.333
HOW DID YOU
END UP IN THE WATER?

08:46.375 --> 08:50.417
I THOUGHT THAT IF I JUMPED,
THE UNDERTOW WOULD TAKE ME.

08:50.458 --> 08:53.375
I WANTED TO DIE.
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE SAVED ME.

08:53.417 --> 08:56.750
I W--I WANT TO DIE.

09:05.792 --> 09:07.750
I DON'T WANT TO FEEL BETTER.

09:07.792 --> 09:11.041
I DON'T WANT SURGERY.
I DON'T WANT TO BE FIXED.

09:11.083 --> 09:13.208
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

09:13.250 --> 09:15.250
WHAT HAPPENED, LAUREN?

09:15.291 --> 09:18.208
W-WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND?

09:22.083 --> 09:24.083
THAT'S JUST IT.
I DON'T KNOW.

09:24.125 --> 09:26.583
WE WERE GONNA HAVE A BABY.
IT WAS FINE.

09:26.625 --> 09:30.083
AND THEN I CAME HOME,
AND THERE WAS THIS NOTE--

09:30.125 --> 09:31.625
A NOTE--

09:31.667 --> 09:33.291
SAYING THAT HE LEFT.

09:33.333 --> 09:36.375
MOST OF HIS THINGS
WERE GONE.

09:36.417 --> 09:38.792
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.

09:38.834 --> 09:43.583
I WAITED FOR DAYS FOR HIM
TO COME BACK OR CALL.

09:43.625 --> 09:46.291
I JUST FELT EMPTY.

09:46.333 --> 09:50.250
I COULDN'T THINK.
I COULDN'T BREATHE.

09:50.291 --> 09:54.709
AND I JUST WANTED IT
TO BE OVER AND DONE

09:54.750 --> 09:58.709
SO I WOULDN'T
FEEL THAT ANYMORE...

09:58.750 --> 10:01.041
AND I WOULDN'T BE ALONE.

10:01.083 --> 10:02.750
(whimpers)

10:02.792 --> 10:05.083
WELL, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE NOT ALONE ANYMORE.

10:05.125 --> 10:07.041
YOU HAVE A BABY UPSTAIRS.

10:07.083 --> 10:09.000
AND I ALMOST KILLED HER.

10:12.667 --> 10:15.625
YOU CAN'T FORCE ME TO HAVE
THIS SURGERY, CAN YOU?

10:15.667 --> 10:20.500
UH, WELL, I-I THINK WE'D ALL
LIKE YOU TO WANT IT.

10:20.542 --> 10:22.542
WELL, I DON'T.

10:22.583 --> 10:24.625
JUST TELL THEM
THAT I REFUSE.

10:27.917 --> 10:30.917
A HUMAN BITE?

10:30.959 --> 10:32.917
SHE'S DENYING IT,
BUT SHE'S GOT TEETH MARKS

10:32.959 --> 10:35.583
AND HER LIVER'S TENDER,
SHE'S GOT A YELLOWISH PALLOR.
WELL, IT'S CERTAINLY
A UNIQUE WAY

10:35.625 --> 10:38.166
TO TRANSMIT HEP B.
AND IF THE TEST CONFIRMS IT,

10:38.208 --> 10:40.792
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND OUT
WHO IT IS,

10:40.834 --> 10:43.792
'CAUSE THEY'RE SICK, TOO,
IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE.
YOU THINK IT'S, LIKE,
A SEXUAL PREDATOR

10:43.834 --> 10:46.333
WHO LIKES BITING YOUNG GIRLS,
HE'S GOT HER SCARED?

10:46.375 --> 10:48.375
MAYBE IT'S ABUSE.
WHAT ABOUT HER MOTHER?

10:48.417 --> 10:50.875
I MEAN, BITING HER?
I DOUBT THAT.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.667
MAYBE IT'S SOME SORT
OF S&amp;M THING.

10:53.709 --> 10:55.041
SHE'S 13 YEARS OLD.

10:55.083 --> 10:57.041
WHO GOES AROUND
BITING 13 YEAR OLDS?

10:57.083 --> 10:58.709
TRY VAMPIRES.

10:58.750 --> 11:01.542
FUNNY.
I'M SERIOUS.

11:01.583 --> 11:05.333
DO YOU NOT LIVE IN AMERICA?
DO THE WORDS "TWILIGHT"

11:05.375 --> 11:08.041
AND "NEW MOON"
MEAN NOTHING TO YOU?
THEY'RE--THEY'RE FICTIONAL.

11:08.083 --> 11:10.041
NOT TO TEENAGE GIRLS
WHO THINK

11:10.083 --> 11:13.000
THE BITE OF A VAMPIRE'S
A SIGN OF ETERNAL LOVE.

11:14.667 --> 11:17.208
HOW COULD YOU LET
SOME BOY BITE YOU?

11:17.250 --> 11:19.208
I KNEW THAT YOU SHOULDN'T
BE HANGING OUT

11:19.250 --> 11:21.750
WITH THAT AMBER AND ASHLEY
AND WHAT'S HER NAME.
THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

11:21.792 --> 11:24.417
YOU HAVE HEPATITIS.
YOU'RE IN THE HOSPITAL.

11:24.458 --> 11:26.041
YOU'RE 13 YEARS OLD.

11:26.083 --> 11:29.667
PAIGE, I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO KNOW THE NAME OF THE BOY,

11:29.709 --> 11:32.667
BECAUSE HE MAY BE SICK, TOO.

11:32.709 --> 11:36.417
YOU'LL TELL 'EM
WHO IT IS, NOW.
ANGIE. ANGIE.

11:36.458 --> 11:38.417
HOW COULD I HAVE MISSED THIS?

11:38.458 --> 11:41.959
WHY DON'T YOU GO
AND GRAB A CUP OF COFFEE,

11:42.000 --> 11:44.792
AND LET US TALK TO HER?
THANKS.
(whispers) IT'S OKAY.

11:44.834 --> 11:47.041
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

11:47.083 --> 11:49.041
HE'S MY SOUL MATE.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.417
WE'RE BOUND TOGETHER
FOR ALL OF ETERNITY.

11:51.458 --> 11:54.542
WE LOVE EACH OTHER.
WELL, THAT'S NICE,
BUT IT SHOULDN'T INVOLVE

11:54.583 --> 11:57.208
BITING SO HARD
THAT IT DRAWS BLOOD.
YEAH.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.667
IT'S JUST A SIGN
OF WHAT WE ARE TO EACH OTHER.

11:59.709 --> 12:02.500
AND HE'S NOT SICK, SO YOU
DON'T NEED TO DO ANYTHING.

12:02.542 --> 12:05.291
HE MIGHT NOT BE SICK NOW,
BUT HE'S CARRYING THE DISEASE,

12:05.333 --> 12:07.208
AND IT COULD BE
DAMAGING HIS LIVER,

12:07.250 --> 12:09.208
WHICH IS VERY SERIOUS.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.208
IF MY MOM KNOWS WHO HE IS,

12:11.250 --> 12:13.208
SHE'LL NEVER LET ME
SEE HIM AGAIN.

12:13.250 --> 12:15.458
SO IF I GET HIM TO COME IN,

12:15.500 --> 12:18.792
WILL YOU PROMISE
NOT TO TELL MY MOM?
W--SHE SHOULD KNOW.

12:18.834 --> 12:20.458
SHE CAN'T.

12:20.500 --> 12:23.542
SO YOU PROMISE...
OR I'M NOT TELLING.

12:27.333 --> 12:30.583
YOU CAN'T PROMISE NOT TO TELL.
THAT KID BIT HER.

12:30.625 --> 12:33.583
HE DREW BLOOD. HE GOT HER SICK.
HER LABS ARE GETTING WORSE.
I KNOW,
BUT IT'S HER BOYFRIEND,

12:33.625 --> 12:35.625
AND THEY WERE NECKING
IN SOME PERVERSE WAY.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.125
IT'S SEXUAL.
IT'S NOT VIOLENT.

12:37.166 --> 12:39.834
IT'S LIKE ANY OTHER CONSENSUAL
SEX ACT A MINOR TELLS US ABOUT.

12:39.875 --> 12:42.041
WE ARE BOUND--
DOCTOR-PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY.

12:42.083 --> 12:44.041
YOUR DATING HABITS ASIDE...
(chuckles)

12:44.083 --> 12:46.750
SUCKING BLOOD IS NOT SEX.
YOUR LACK
OF DATING HABITS ASIDE,

12:46.792 --> 12:48.291
YOU HEARD WHAT SHE SAID.

12:48.333 --> 12:50.500
SHE THINKS SHE'S IN LOVE--
SHE'S 13.

12:50.542 --> 12:53.041
BOTTOM LINE IS, IT'S SEX.
IT'S NOT VIOLENCE.

12:53.083 --> 12:56.083
WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
I'LL MAKE HER THE PROMISE.

12:56.125 --> 12:59.041
WE'LL GET THE KID IN HERE.
I'LL SEE IF HE'S SICK.

12:59.083 --> 13:01.083
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT
FROM THERE.

13:01.125 --> 13:03.667
YOU KNOW, WE COULD ALWAYS
SEAL HIS COFFIN,

13:03.709 --> 13:06.125
EXPOSE HIM TO SUNLIGHT.

13:06.166 --> 13:08.667
(Sam) WITHOUT THE SURGERY,
SHE WILL DIE.

13:08.709 --> 13:11.041
WHICH IS WHY YOU HAVE TO 51-50
HER. NOT HAVING THE SURGERY

13:11.083 --> 13:14.041
IS JUST ANOTHER WAY FOR HER
TO ATTEMPT SUICIDE.
WELL, LEGALLY
AND ETHICALLY SPEAKING,

13:14.083 --> 13:16.458
REFUSING TREATMENT
ISN'T THE SAME AT ALL.

13:16.500 --> 13:19.500
AND SHE'S DEPRESSED.
SHE'S NOT CRAZY.

13:19.542 --> 13:21.667
SHE TRIED TO KILL HERSELF
AND HER BABY. THAT'S NOT CRAZY?

13:21.709 --> 13:24.291
NO.
SO SHE TRIES TO KILL HERSELF,
FAILS,

13:24.333 --> 13:27.291
BUT GETS CLOSE ENOUGH THAT
SHE MIGHT ACTUALLY GET HER WISH?
SHE AGREED TO TRY
ANTIDEPRESSANTS.

13:27.333 --> 13:30.291
THAT MIGHT HELP. THOUGH I THINK
SHE PROBABLY ONLY AGREED TO IT

13:30.333 --> 13:33.959
'CAUSE SHE'S HOPING HE'LL
CHANGE HIS MIND AND COME BACK.
WELL, WE CAN'T WAIT FOR
THE ANTIDEPRESSANTS TO WORK.

13:34.041 --> 13:37.709
SHE'LL DIE.
WE HAVE TO FORCE THE SURGERY.
NO. HER DEPRESSION
MAKES THAT A BAD IDEA.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.375
IT DOUBLES HER RISK
OF DYING ON THE TABLE,

13:40.417 --> 13:42.917
AND IT'S DICEY ENOUGH
AS IT IS.

13:42.959 --> 13:46.041
ALL RIGHT, THEN I'LL--
I'LL GO FIND MICHAEL,

13:46.083 --> 13:49.625
GET HIM TO COME HERE.
WHAT, YOU THINK IT'S THAT EASY
TO JUST MAKE HIM LOVE HER?

13:49.667 --> 13:52.417
HIS WIFE IS DYING.
HE HAS A BABY.

13:52.458 --> 13:54.917
THERE COULD'VE BEEN A THOUSAND
REASONS WHY HE WALKED AWAY.

13:54.959 --> 13:57.834
I'M GONNA GO FIND HIM.
GOOD LUCK
TRYING TO CHANGE HIS MIND.

13:57.875 --> 14:00.000
(knock on door)

14:05.333 --> 14:07.500
WE'VE BEEN CALLING,
LEAVING MESSAGES.

14:07.542 --> 14:10.291
I KNOW. I GOT THEM.

14:10.333 --> 14:13.041
YOUR WIFE AND CHILD
ARE IN THE HOSPITAL.

14:13.083 --> 14:16.083
LAUREN'S REFUSING TO HAVE
A SURGERY THAT COULD SAVE HER

14:16.125 --> 14:17.542
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT THERE.

14:17.583 --> 14:20.542
SHE SAID YOU LEFT
OUT OF THE BLUE.
OU-OUT OF THE BLUE?

14:20.583 --> 14:23.041
LOOK, THIS DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN.

14:23.083 --> 14:26.041
I TR--I TRIED TO GET HER
TO SEE FOR A LONG TIME.

14:26.083 --> 14:28.750
SHE JUST DIDN'T...

14:28.792 --> 14:31.750
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO SEE IT.
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LISTEN.

14:31.792 --> 14:35.375
THEN SHE GOT PREGNANT,
AND I TRIED TO MAKE IT WORK.

14:35.417 --> 14:38.375
BUT I JUST--I... I CAN'T.
WHAT ABOUT THE BABY?

14:38.417 --> 14:41.041
I NEVER WANTED A BABY.
SHE KNEW THAT.

14:41.083 --> 14:45.583
AND I-I--LOOK, I TRIED TO BE
OKAY WITH THAT, BUT I'M NOT.

14:45.625 --> 14:47.458
I DON'T LOVE HER ANYMORE.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.500
OKAY, MICHAEL, LOOK,
CAN YOU JUST BE THERE FOR HER,

14:50.542 --> 14:54.250
JUST FOR NOW, JUST UNTIL
SHE'S A LITTLE STRONGER?
LOOK, I'LL SUPPORT THE BABY.
I TOLD HER THAT.

14:54.291 --> 14:57.583
BUT IF I--IF I GO BACK,
SHE'S JUST GONNA DO IT AGAIN

14:57.625 --> 15:01.834
THE NEXT TIME I GO,
AND I'LL NEVER GET AWAY.

15:08.959 --> 15:12.667
LOOK, WHAT I DID TO PAIGE,
IT'S NOT A BAD THING.

15:12.709 --> 15:15.458
IT JUST SIGNIFIES
THAT OUR SOULS ARE CONNECTED.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.458
YEAH, BUT YOUR VIRUSES, TOO.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.917
IT'S A HEALTH HAZARD.

15:18.959 --> 15:20.583
SO I DO NEED TO KNOW...

15:20.625 --> 15:23.542
IF YOU'VE DONE THIS BITING THING
WITH ANY OTHER GIRLS.

15:23.583 --> 15:27.333
OF COURSE NOT.
I'M JUST ASKING, YOU KNOW,
DOCTOR TO PATIENT, JUST US.

15:27.375 --> 15:29.709
I DON'T MEAN
TO EMBARRASS YOU.

15:29.750 --> 15:31.500
LOOK, YOU MAY NOT
UNDERSTAND THIS,

15:31.542 --> 15:33.750
BUT... (clears throat)

15:33.792 --> 15:36.041
WE'RE DESTINED
FOR EACH OTHER.

15:36.083 --> 15:39.083
I WOULD NEVER BETRAY THAT.

15:39.125 --> 15:42.083
I'VE WALKED THIS EARTH
FOR 2,000 YEARS,

15:42.125 --> 15:44.834
SEARCHING FOR HER.

15:44.875 --> 15:46.041
YEAH.

15:46.083 --> 15:48.834
UM, I'VE USED
A LOT OF LINES IN MY DAY.

15:48.875 --> 15:51.208
I'M NOT BUYING THAT ONE.
WELL, I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO.

15:51.250 --> 15:54.291
OKAY, I'M GONNA NEED TO KNOW
THE NAMES OF ALL THE GIRLS

15:54.333 --> 15:56.959
THAT YOU'VE DONE
THIS BITING THING WITH.
PAIGE TOLD ME.
YOU CAN'T TELL ANYONE.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.041
NO, BUT I CAN TELL HER
WHAT A LITTLE SCHMUCK YOU ARE.
AND YOU THINK
SHE'D BELIEVE YOU?

16:00.083 --> 16:03.041
SHE AND HER FRIENDS LOVE
ALL THIS VAMPIRE CRAP.

16:03.083 --> 16:07.500
TELL ME WHO ELSE
YOU HAVE BITTEN.
NO OFFENSE, BUT BITE ME.

16:13.792 --> 16:15.750
HEY.
HEY.

16:15.792 --> 16:17.667
YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
YOU OKAY?

16:17.709 --> 16:19.667
UGH. (sighs)
ONE OF MY PATIENTS

16:19.709 --> 16:22.667
HAS HUNG HER ENTIRE
LIFE'S HAPPINESS ON A MAN.

16:22.709 --> 16:25.375
HE'S GONE,
AND NOW SHE WANTS TO DIE.

16:25.417 --> 16:27.667
WELL, SHE WOULDN'T BE
THE FIRST PERSON.

16:27.709 --> 16:30.500
WHY DO WOMEN LET MEN
DO THAT TO THEM,

16:30.542 --> 16:33.291
LET 'EM GET INSIDE THEIR HEAD
AND MAKE 'EM CRAZY?

16:33.333 --> 16:36.041
AND THEY MAKE US FEEL
REALLY GOOD WHEN IT'S... GOOD,

16:36.083 --> 16:38.041
AND THEN...
THEY MAKE US WANT TO

16:38.083 --> 16:41.792
CURL UP IN A LITTLE BALL
AND DIE WHEN WE CAN'T HAVE THEM.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
YOUR PATIENT, RIGHT?

16:41.834 --> 16:44.166
HOW'S THAT SPEECH GOING
FOR TONIGHT?

16:44.208 --> 16:46.041
OH, UGH. WILLIAM WHITE--

16:46.083 --> 16:48.583
I MEAN, HOW DO YOU WRITE
A SPEECH ABOUT A BILLIONAIRE?

16:48.625 --> 16:51.959
YOU WRITE ABOUT THE MAN,
NOT THE MONEY.
YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT IT IS WILLIAM WHITE.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.500
YOU KNOW, THAT'S A MAN

16:53.542 --> 16:56.041
WHO COULD GET INTO YOUR HEAD
AND MAKE YOU CRAZY.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.375
YOU KNOW--
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
WILLIAM WHITE?

16:58.417 --> 17:00.625
WILLIAM WHITE?

17:00.667 --> 17:01.792
YE--NO.

17:03.625 --> 17:06.458
ALL RIGHT, THERE...
THERE WAS A LOOK.

17:06.500 --> 17:07.750
UH-HUH.

17:07.792 --> 17:09.792
AND A... MOMENT.
MM-HMM.

17:09.834 --> 17:12.667
AND HE TOUCHED MY HAND.
OH! HE LIKES YOU.

17:12.709 --> 17:14.667
OH...

17:14.709 --> 17:16.750
ALL RIGHT, THERE WAS--
THERE WAS DEFINITELY SOMETHING.

17:16.792 --> 17:18.542
BUT I JUST...

17:18.583 --> 17:23.166
I CAN'T DECIDE WHETHER
IT WAS EXCITING OR...

17:23.208 --> 17:25.041
SEXUAL HARASSMENT-Y OR--

17:25.083 --> 17:27.667
ALL THE MORE REASON
TO GO TONIGHT, TO FIND OUT.

17:27.709 --> 17:30.041
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT
THESE EVENTS ARE FOR.

17:30.083 --> 17:33.041
AND THERE'S AN OPEN BAR. I MEAN,
YOU GET DRUNK, GET LUCKY.
YEAH, BUT THE IDEA OF
GETTING DRESSED UP

17:33.083 --> 17:35.166
AND--AND PRETENDING
TO ENJOY MYSELF

17:35.208 --> 17:38.208
WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S
GOING ON, IT'S JUST--
OH, COME ON. IT'LL BE FUN.
WE COULD BOTH USE IT.

17:38.250 --> 17:40.000
WILLIAM WHITE.

17:42.834 --> 17:44.291
WILLIAM WHITE.

17:44.333 --> 17:45.583
(laughs)

17:45.625 --> 17:48.375
HEY.
YOUR FEVER'S DOWN.

17:48.417 --> 17:50.875
THAT'S GOOD.
HOW YOU FEELING?
GREAT.

17:50.917 --> 17:53.375
GOOD.
I TOLD YOU
SETH COULDN'T GET SICK.

17:53.417 --> 17:56.458
HE'S TOO STRONG. I MUST HAVE
GOTTEN THIS SOME OTHER WAY.

17:56.500 --> 17:59.625
OKAY, UM, PAIGE, THERE'S
NO GOOD WAY TO SAY THIS,

17:59.667 --> 18:01.417
SO...

18:01.458 --> 18:04.083
HE'S BEEN BITING OTHER GIRLS.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.250
(chuckles)
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.

18:06.291 --> 18:09.125
THESE OTHER GIRLS
COULD GET SICK.

18:09.166 --> 18:13.125
HE SAID THEY WERE YOUR FRIENDS.
WE NEED TO KNOW WHO THEY ARE.
SETH WOULDN'T DO THAT.

18:13.166 --> 18:16.041
MY FRIENDS
WOULDN'T DO THAT TO ME.
WELL, PAIGE, HE--

18:16.083 --> 18:17.500
YOU DON'T GET IT.
PAIGE--

18:17.542 --> 18:20.083
STOP TRYING TO TURN THIS
INTO SOMETHING BAD.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.458
OH, I GOTTA ADMIT, SAM,
I'M LOST.

18:26.500 --> 18:30.458
THIS IS ALL VERY PINK.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.041
YEAH, SHE WANTS, UH...
PINK CANDY ALMONDS

18:33.083 --> 18:36.667
WITH "MAYA AND DINK FOREVER"
STAMPED ON THEM.

18:36.709 --> 18:38.625
SO I'M TRYING TO FIND...

18:38.667 --> 18:40.417
(laughs) SO I GUESS THE, UH,

18:40.458 --> 18:43.041
THE HORSE DRAWN CARRIAGE
IS OUT?
(laughs) OKAY.

18:43.083 --> 18:46.041
WAIT. A HOT AIR BALLOON...
(laughs)

18:46.083 --> 18:47.583
THOSE ARE HER IDEAS.

18:47.625 --> 18:50.583
(laughs)

18:50.625 --> 18:52.542
HEY.

18:52.583 --> 18:54.667
HEY.
HI.

18:54.709 --> 18:56.583
WOW, WEDDING STUFF, HUH?

18:56.625 --> 18:58.875
MM-HMM.
YOU NEED A HAND?

18:58.917 --> 19:00.959
UH, NO. WE'RE GOOD.
WE'RE GOOD. THANKS.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.083
WHAT'S UP?
(clears throat)

19:03.125 --> 19:05.709
I JUST WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT LAUREN.

19:05.750 --> 19:08.250
DID YOU TALK TO THE HUSBAND?

19:08.291 --> 19:11.250
YEAH, HE DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING
TO DO WITH HER OR THE BABY.

19:11.291 --> 19:15.000
DO YOU WANT ME
TO GO WITH YOU TO TELL HER?
WE CAN'T.

19:15.041 --> 19:16.750
WHAT,
YOU CAN'T TELL HER?

19:16.792 --> 19:19.000
YOU THINK IT'S BETTER
TO GIVE HER FALSE HOPE

19:19.041 --> 19:21.500
THAT HE'S GONNA SHOW UP?
IF IT GETS HER
INTO SURGERY, YEAH.

19:21.542 --> 19:24.500
OH, GOOD. ALL RIGHT.
SO THEN WE LIE TO HER,

19:24.542 --> 19:28.375
I FIX HER HEART,
THEN WE BREAK IT AGAIN.
BUT SHE'LL BE ALIVE.
UNLESS YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.375
I MEAN,
THIS WAY WE HAVE TIME

19:30.417 --> 19:32.375
FOR THE ANTIDEPRESSANTS
TO KICK IN.

19:32.417 --> 19:35.291
I MEAN, MAYBE HE'LL CHANGE
HIS MIND AND COME AROUND.

19:35.333 --> 19:37.583
OH, DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN, ADDISON?

19:37.625 --> 19:40.542
YOU REALLY THINK THAT SHE SHOULD
WAIT AROUND FOR THAT?

19:40.583 --> 19:43.542
VIOLET, CAN YOU GIVE US
A FEW MINUTES?

19:43.583 --> 19:45.333
YES.

19:45.375 --> 19:48.041
(man)
♪ I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY ♪

19:48.083 --> 19:50.542
♪ FOR YOU ♪

19:50.583 --> 19:52.041
♪ TO CHANGE ♪

19:52.083 --> 19:53.875
REALLY, SAM?

19:53.917 --> 19:55.834
YOU'RE GONNA BE
THIS GUY?

19:55.875 --> 19:57.834
I TELL YOU
WE CAN'T BE TOGETHER,

ISN'T LIKE THAT.

ALL THE TIME.

34:14.875 --> 34:17.166
AND WE LIE TO THEM.

34:17.208 --> 34:20.667

YOURSELF OR THE OTHER PERSON.

34:20.709 --> 34:23.792
SOMETIMES IT'S HOW YOU TRY
TO GET WHAT YOU WANT.

34:23.834 --> 34:25.583
AND SOMETIMES
IT'S JUST EASIER.

34:25.625 --> 34:28.166

NEVER LYING TO EACH OTHER,

34:28.208 --> 34:30.375
YOU'RE NOT READY FOR IT.
