WEBVTT

01:18.861 --> 01:20.602
Aren't you tired?

01:23.735 --> 01:25.824
Can't we just
let it all go?

01:28.566 --> 01:30.481
We could walk
to the ocean.

01:38.272 --> 01:39.882
- I knew
this was gonna happen.

01:39.925 --> 01:41.275
Nothing has happened.

01:41.318 --> 01:44.452
- How can you say that?
What if they call Don in?

01:44.495 --> 01:45.714
Now they know
about the boatyard.

01:45.757 --> 01:48.238
- Don's not gonna be
a problem.

01:48.282 --> 01:49.674
You sure about that?

01:49.718 --> 01:51.023
What if they start
asking him questions?

01:51.067 --> 01:52.851
Oh, for fuck's sake, Sean.

01:57.334 --> 01:58.857
You want some eggs?

02:00.032 --> 02:01.860
- Such five-star service.

02:03.514 --> 02:07.170
You boys put our future
on the line more often,

02:07.214 --> 02:08.780
maybe I'll get eggs
all the time.

02:08.824 --> 02:10.260
It's fine.

02:10.304 --> 02:11.740
Nothing to worry about.

02:11.783 --> 02:14.786
- Yeah, just 15 years
to life

02:14.830 --> 02:17.180
for my two sons.

02:17.224 --> 02:20.314
Or a fine
of $1 1/2 million minimum.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.274
Who told you that?

02:24.318 --> 02:27.059
The internet.

02:27.103 --> 02:28.757
I couldn't sleep all night.

02:29.932 --> 02:31.890
Harry Ambrose knows
what you're doing.

02:31.934 --> 02:34.502
- I'm telling you,
none of this traces back to us.

02:35.677 --> 02:38.158
It doesn't.
I made sure of it.

02:38.201 --> 02:39.333
And Verne's
not gonna talk.

02:39.376 --> 02:40.551
You don't know that.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.162
- Trust me,
if we stay quiet,

02:42.205 --> 02:43.337
this all blows over.

02:43.380 --> 02:46.296
- I can't believe
you resorted to this.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.080
Those poor people.

02:48.124 --> 02:49.430
- All we did
was move 'em

02:49.473 --> 02:52.302
from one place
to another.

02:52.346 --> 02:54.261
Help 'em find
some work.

02:54.304 --> 02:55.653
I taught you better.

02:55.697 --> 02:58.439
- How else were we supposed
to stay above water?

03:01.703 --> 03:05.489
Ma, you looked
at the books.

03:05.533 --> 03:07.317
You knew there was money
coming in from somewhere.

03:07.361 --> 03:09.319
- I thought you were
overfishing

03:09.363 --> 03:11.756
and selling on the side
like everybody else.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.105
Not this.

03:13.149 --> 03:16.108
We did this for you.

03:16.152 --> 03:17.284
"Save the family business,"

03:17.327 --> 03:18.546
that's all we ever hear
around here.

03:18.589 --> 03:20.025
And I'm the one
who has to figure it out

03:20.069 --> 03:21.636
over and over and over.

03:21.679 --> 03:23.464
You think I enjoy doing
what we did?

03:23.507 --> 03:24.813
It was a stupid idea.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.380
Shut the fuck up.

03:26.423 --> 03:28.425
Six days sober,
and you're the moral authority?

03:28.469 --> 03:30.906
You were right there with me.

03:30.949 --> 03:34.126
Maybe...

03:34.170 --> 03:36.651
we just go tell Lou now.

03:36.694 --> 03:38.609
Maybe...

03:38.653 --> 03:40.524
he can make a deal for us.

03:40.568 --> 03:44.006
- No, this family
has lost enough.

03:45.268 --> 03:47.749
We stay quiet,
we stay together

03:47.792 --> 03:48.967
no matter what.

03:49.011 --> 03:50.752
There's no other way.

04:07.769 --> 04:11.076
- So, Don,
you can make this

04:11.120 --> 04:13.035
easy on yourself
or worse.

04:14.297 --> 04:15.820
Your choice.

04:18.997 --> 04:20.434
I'm getting my coffee.

04:24.307 --> 04:25.569
I need the names

04:25.613 --> 04:27.092
of everybody
on Hanover Island

04:27.136 --> 04:28.920
who moved people on boats

04:28.964 --> 04:31.314
or took a cut,

04:31.358 --> 04:33.490
and you'll be looking
at a lot less time.

04:34.926 --> 04:36.014
Maybe nothing.

04:37.799 --> 04:40.062
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

04:42.804 --> 04:45.110
- Where were you sending them
in Canada?

04:45.154 --> 04:48.157
- That sounds like a lot
of conspiracy nonsense to me.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.464
- Okay, just--

04:50.507 --> 04:53.771
do you have children,
grandchildren?

04:55.773 --> 04:57.601
You want to be around
for them, right?

05:00.125 --> 05:01.779
You have no hard evidence

05:01.823 --> 05:04.086
for any of this shit
you're alleging.

05:04.129 --> 05:06.523
- Yeah, because you burned
a good part of it.

05:08.003 --> 05:11.876
But I know that someone died
because of this.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.922
And that death's
gonna come down on you.

05:15.053 --> 05:16.141
So tell me now,

05:16.185 --> 05:19.231
or I'll find out
some other way

05:19.275 --> 05:21.495
and it'll only go worse
for you.

05:22.365 --> 05:25.063
You law guys,

05:25.107 --> 05:26.238
flinging your handcuffs around

05:26.282 --> 05:29.198
'cause you got
nothing else to live for.

05:29.241 --> 05:32.027
Sad is what it is.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.122
Thanks, hon.

05:41.689 --> 05:44.300
There's no one else
who's gonna help you.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.823
Not here.

05:48.217 --> 05:49.697
Hey, Harry.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.875
No running off this time.
Let's go.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.031
Get out.

06:24.471 --> 06:25.515
- I don't know
what you're doing,

06:25.559 --> 06:27.996
but you're making
a big mistake.

06:28.039 --> 06:31.478
- Made a big mistake.
Come here.

06:42.750 --> 06:45.143
You were right, okay?

06:47.581 --> 06:49.409
The ballistics came back?

06:49.452 --> 06:51.411
Early this morning.

06:51.454 --> 06:52.716
Novak's piece

06:52.760 --> 06:55.240
fired the bullet
into Brandon's head.

06:55.284 --> 06:57.025
Shoe fits, like you said.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.855
I checked the records.

07:00.898 --> 07:03.423
Josh was on duty
the night Percy jumped.

07:03.466 --> 07:05.076
So I checked
the security camera files

07:05.120 --> 07:07.296
to see
if she actually showed up.

07:07.339 --> 07:09.254
The files from that night
are the only ones missing.

07:11.213 --> 07:14.129
- And now Josh is gone.
Skipped town.

07:15.913 --> 07:18.568
I guess Novak was
paying him off the whole time.

07:20.091 --> 07:22.572
- So you bring him in yet,
Novak?

07:22.616 --> 07:24.226
Ah, he lawyered up.

07:24.269 --> 07:26.663
Some shady guy who looks like

07:26.707 --> 07:30.798
Sylvester Stallone
in a...Mazda.

07:32.103 --> 07:35.498
I swear to God, Harry,
this whole thing...

07:35.542 --> 07:37.718
happening right under my nose,

07:37.761 --> 07:39.459
my own friends?

07:40.938 --> 07:42.984
It's like,
how could I be that naive?

07:45.726 --> 07:48.859
I always thought
this was the kind of place

07:48.903 --> 07:50.992
where nothing bad happens.

07:53.298 --> 07:58.042
And those people--
how they were treated...

07:58.086 --> 08:00.784
under my watch.

08:00.828 --> 08:03.831
And what I did
to Mike Lam.

08:07.965 --> 08:10.011
- Nothing's ever
what you think it is.

08:36.211 --> 08:37.517
Must be nice,

08:37.560 --> 08:39.649
to be so lazy
at your job.

08:40.650 --> 08:41.999
Always do
the easy thing,

08:42.043 --> 08:43.827
and not even a slap
on the wrist.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.229
- Maybe next time,
you'll listen to the truth.

09:00.235 --> 09:03.586
- So that hard drive
at Hal Balen's shop?

09:03.630 --> 09:04.805
We hit the mother lode.

09:04.848 --> 09:06.284
Cuesta called it in
to the feds,

09:06.328 --> 09:07.677
and they've known

09:07.721 --> 09:10.027
about trafficking
in this area over a year.

09:11.289 --> 09:13.335
- All right.
And?

09:13.378 --> 09:16.425
- And they appreciate
what we sent over.

09:16.468 --> 09:17.774
Hands off for us now.

09:20.951 --> 09:23.563
They don't want it
jeopardizing their work, okay?

09:23.606 --> 09:24.912
What work?

09:24.955 --> 09:26.348
- Apparently Hanover Island's
an offshoot

09:26.391 --> 09:28.176
of a much larger operation.

09:28.219 --> 09:29.786
They're after
a bigger fish here.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.483
- It's likely
there's a homicide

09:31.527 --> 09:34.051
tied to that operation.

09:34.095 --> 09:36.271
You don't think
we should look into it?

09:36.314 --> 09:38.752
- I don't know
what to tell you, man.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.928
Chain of command.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.368
- Harry, I know
it's frustrating,

09:46.411 --> 09:48.065
but you've already done a lot.

09:49.284 --> 09:50.546
There was a victim

09:50.590 --> 09:52.983
that Percy felt
responsible for.

09:53.027 --> 09:54.332
And I think it was
one of the people

09:54.376 --> 09:55.595
who were being smuggled.

09:55.638 --> 09:56.857
So what else can we do?

09:56.900 --> 09:58.946
We can't track 'em all down
across Canada.

10:00.774 --> 10:02.950
There's an unknown number

10:02.993 --> 10:04.865
on Verne Novak's phone.

10:04.908 --> 10:08.782
It's somebody else local
who Verne was working with.

10:08.825 --> 10:12.002
I call and call,
and no one picks up.

10:14.265 --> 10:15.832
- You want me to trace
the address.

11:22.594 --> 11:24.640
<i>- Hey. </i>
What'd you find?

11:24.684 --> 11:27.730
- Calls were coming in
from a payphone.

11:27.774 --> 11:28.992
Happens to be
across the street

11:29.036 --> 11:31.734
from Colin Muldoon's place.

11:31.778 --> 11:34.694
<i>- Shit. </i>
So you were right.

11:34.737 --> 11:37.174
<i>He's part of this too.</i>

11:37.218 --> 11:39.699
- And it looks like
he's got company.

11:39.742 --> 11:41.788
Let me call you back.

12:30.837 --> 12:33.361
<i>- Those are just the taxes </i>
from the last five years.

12:33.404 --> 12:34.536
<i>I can go back further </i>
if you need.

12:34.579 --> 12:37.321
- No, no.
This is all right.

12:37.365 --> 12:40.890
So it was--looks like
two years ago, 2019,

12:40.934 --> 12:44.415
that the Lams' income
took a big jump.

12:44.459 --> 12:46.461
- Yeah, that was
around the time

12:46.504 --> 12:48.332
they got their own
lobstering permit.

12:48.376 --> 12:50.552
Soon after that,
they bought the restaurant.

12:50.595 --> 12:52.032
- While they were working
the Muldoon boats?

12:52.075 --> 12:54.425
- Yeah.
- So...

12:54.469 --> 12:57.341
I mean, where'd they get
this kind of money?

12:57.385 --> 12:59.561
People did wonder.

12:59.604 --> 13:01.084
Those permits are anywhere

13:01.128 --> 13:03.695
from 50 grand
to $1/2 million.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.306
- Families hold on
to them, right?

13:05.349 --> 13:06.568
For generations.

13:06.611 --> 13:09.876
And the waiting list
is 20 years long.

13:09.919 --> 13:14.358
It's not exactly a system
that's open to newcomers.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.970
Well, the Lams got one.

13:18.972 --> 13:20.582
I'm so confused.

13:20.625 --> 13:23.454
I was just apologizing
to Mike Lam.

13:23.498 --> 13:25.717
And now, what, we're saying
that he's involved

13:25.761 --> 13:28.242
in the smuggling ring, too,

13:28.285 --> 13:30.461
and the permit
was some kind of payout?

13:31.593 --> 13:33.813
This is a land deed.

13:41.211 --> 13:43.083
- Crescent Island.
- Sold to--

13:43.126 --> 13:46.303
- Mike Lam.
By Sean Muldoon.

13:46.347 --> 13:47.870
For $10.

13:51.569 --> 13:53.702
You know that spot?

13:53.745 --> 13:55.225
- Yeah,
it's one of a few

13:55.269 --> 13:56.792
tiny islands
off Riverport.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.663
You couldn't even build
a house on it.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.796
It's mostly just rock.

15:39.068 --> 15:40.417
Hey.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.507
Hi.

15:43.551 --> 15:46.902
Getting back to work, huh?

15:46.946 --> 15:48.295
Your dad's home.

15:48.338 --> 15:50.123
Bet you're glad about that.

15:50.166 --> 15:53.126
I mean, I guess.

15:53.169 --> 15:55.998
But this whole thing
just makes me very un-glad.

15:56.042 --> 15:59.045
- Yeah.
That's understandable.

16:01.612 --> 16:03.440
Appreciate you helping us.

16:07.096 --> 16:09.794
- Look, I had something
I wanted to ask you about.

16:11.274 --> 16:12.536
I found this.

16:15.235 --> 16:17.106
It was out on Crescent Island.

16:19.239 --> 16:21.676
The one your family owns.

16:21.719 --> 16:24.592
I know there's one of these

16:24.635 --> 16:26.986
for each of you in the family.

16:27.029 --> 16:30.990
This one...

16:31.033 --> 16:33.644
this is for your brother, Bo,
back in Hong Kong?

16:37.561 --> 16:39.781
- What does that have to do
with anything?

16:41.652 --> 16:44.177
- He's not really
back in Hong Kong, is he?

16:45.874 --> 16:48.181
Asked around about him.

16:48.224 --> 16:50.618
I know he was here.

16:50.661 --> 16:52.315
He worked boats
at Clark Harbor,

16:52.359 --> 16:54.448
and that was

16:54.491 --> 16:57.842
up until...two years ago.

16:59.714 --> 17:04.501
<i>Sounds like, for your folks, </i>
he was the real golden child.

17:06.329 --> 17:09.071
<i>He was one that everybody said </i>
had the best chance

17:09.115 --> 17:13.510
<i>of pulling off the whole </i>
American dream thing.

17:14.990 --> 17:17.297
<i>He was there through it all.</i>

17:17.340 --> 17:21.562
<i>Protecting your family </i>
every step of the way.

17:25.087 --> 17:28.482
But he's buried
out on that island, isn't he?

17:38.187 --> 17:39.536
I gotta finish up here.

17:39.580 --> 17:42.191
CJ, what happened to him?

17:44.541 --> 17:46.369
No one wants you to do this.

17:46.413 --> 17:48.502
I'm on your side.

17:48.545 --> 17:51.461
Then listen to me.

17:51.505 --> 17:52.723
Stop.

18:06.868 --> 18:11.699
- One year, two years tops,
we'll have our own permit.

18:11.742 --> 18:13.701
Lobster, obviously.

18:13.744 --> 18:15.746
Hopefully some groundfish too.

18:15.790 --> 18:18.880
A restaurant
on the boardwalk.

18:18.923 --> 18:21.709
Lean into all that
dumb tourist crap.

18:21.752 --> 18:22.884
Little plastic crabs

18:22.927 --> 18:24.886
for salt shakers
or some shit.

18:24.929 --> 18:27.715
Two boats at least.

18:27.758 --> 18:29.456
- I hate
those damn boats.

18:29.499 --> 18:30.674
Come on.

18:30.718 --> 18:32.720
- Seriously, man,
getting up at 4:00?

18:32.763 --> 18:33.895
Feeling sick
all the time?

18:33.938 --> 18:35.201
Or, like,
I can never stand normal

18:35.244 --> 18:37.159
'cause I'm rocking or, like,
feel like I am.

18:37.203 --> 18:39.553
"Wah, wah, my name is CJ.

18:39.596 --> 18:40.684
I'm sick all the time."

18:40.728 --> 18:42.382
You only work weekends.

18:42.425 --> 18:44.253
- I mean, all these people here
who say fishing is addictive,

18:44.297 --> 18:45.428
they're psycho.

18:45.472 --> 18:47.996
I hate all of it.

18:48.039 --> 18:49.954
- Well, good.
You're really bad at it.

18:49.998 --> 18:52.348
It'd be tragic if you're so bad
at something you liked.

18:52.392 --> 18:54.611
Fuck you.

18:57.266 --> 18:59.747
- The whole point is,
though, CJ,

18:59.790 --> 19:01.270
you don't have to do it.

19:04.012 --> 19:06.014
I'm gonna make sure
we're solid.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.278
Then you can do
whatever you want.

20:02.636 --> 20:03.724
Hey, Sean.

20:05.552 --> 20:06.770
What are you doing here?

20:08.294 --> 20:10.948
- I'm headed back
to Dorchester.

20:10.992 --> 20:12.559
Thought I'd say goodbye.

20:13.908 --> 20:17.172
They got all they need
on Verne Novak.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.827
No need for me
to stick around, I guess.

20:22.264 --> 20:24.788
How you been doing?

20:27.661 --> 20:29.663
All right.

20:29.706 --> 20:32.318
- That's the hardest part,
you know.

20:32.361 --> 20:35.451
This phase of it.

20:35.495 --> 20:36.757
Funeral's over,
you know,

20:36.800 --> 20:39.281
and neighbors stop
checking in.

20:39.325 --> 20:42.241
I remember that from
when my mother passed on.

20:44.068 --> 20:45.679
What do you want?

20:48.334 --> 20:50.553
- I was out
on Crescent Island yesterday.

20:54.818 --> 20:56.690
I saw Bo Lam's grave.

20:59.823 --> 21:03.697
He's buried on land
that used to be in your name.

21:04.959 --> 21:07.527
There must be
a good reason for that.

21:10.660 --> 21:13.184
Sean, you always
gonna look to them

21:13.228 --> 21:14.360
to tell you what to do?

21:16.100 --> 21:19.016
Keeping secrets...

21:19.060 --> 21:21.236
you know,
they never go away.

21:24.457 --> 21:27.198
They're just gonna haunt you

21:27.242 --> 21:28.852
like they haunted her.

21:30.724 --> 21:33.640
Sean, what happened
to Bo?

21:38.384 --> 21:40.255
- What the hell
are you doing here?

21:40.299 --> 21:43.563
- You gotta say it,
for your sake.

21:44.738 --> 21:45.739
Say it for Bo.

21:45.782 --> 21:47.828
- What'd you tell him?
- Nothing.

21:47.871 --> 21:49.612
- You need to get the fuck
out of here.

21:49.656 --> 21:51.353
I'm serious.
Right now.

21:51.397 --> 21:53.355
- Sean, what would Percy
want you to do?

21:53.399 --> 21:55.226
- I said leave.
You hear me?

21:55.270 --> 21:56.793
What's going on?

21:57.751 --> 21:59.970
Sean...

22:00.014 --> 22:01.494
- What are you--

22:01.537 --> 22:02.973
Just say it.

22:03.017 --> 22:04.279
We killed him.

22:05.236 --> 22:07.064
No.

22:07.108 --> 22:08.457
Bo used to work for us,

22:08.501 --> 22:11.199
and we took him one night
on our boat.

22:11.242 --> 22:12.983
- What the hell
are you doing?

22:13.027 --> 22:15.899
I am not lying anymore!

22:25.996 --> 22:27.389
It was two years ago.

22:31.001 --> 22:32.133
<i>It's outrageous.</i>

22:32.176 --> 22:33.439
Yeah, tell me about it.

22:33.482 --> 22:35.397
- After all
we've done for them.

22:35.441 --> 22:36.572
And where
was he selling them?

22:36.616 --> 22:38.574
- To Tom Billings
in Chester.

22:38.618 --> 22:40.489
Dumb enough to think that
that wouldn't get back to us.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.186
So how did you miss this?

22:42.230 --> 22:44.275
I didn't.

22:44.319 --> 22:45.755
I saw the gas gauge,

22:45.799 --> 22:47.496
and I told Colin I thought
someone was using the boat.

22:47.540 --> 22:50.412
- Yeah, but you missed--
- Our hauls were lower.

22:50.456 --> 22:53.023
- Okay, fine.
What do you want me to do?

22:53.067 --> 22:56.070
- I want you to do your job,
Sean, for once.

22:57.985 --> 22:59.421
Bo's been skimming?

22:59.465 --> 23:01.423
- Yeah, he's been taking
the boat out

23:01.467 --> 23:02.598
and stealing
from the traps.

23:02.642 --> 23:04.208
And your pop didn't even
fucking notice.

23:04.252 --> 23:05.601
I'll handle it, okay?

23:05.645 --> 23:07.429
I'll take him out
on the boat.

23:07.473 --> 23:08.604
Lay down the law.

23:08.648 --> 23:10.258
- You should have hired
what's-his-nuts,

23:10.301 --> 23:12.608
Mark Brady's nephew,
not the Lams.

23:12.652 --> 23:14.001
Don't start that again.

23:14.044 --> 23:15.394
- These out-of-towners
with no ties here,

23:15.437 --> 23:16.873
they just look out
for themselves.

23:16.917 --> 23:18.266
- Oh, yeah, the same thing
happened with the Laniers,

23:18.309 --> 23:19.441
the guy they hired
from California.

23:19.485 --> 23:21.400
- Mm-hmm.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.793
- Sounds like you should
all go out,

23:23.837 --> 23:25.534
'cause Sean needs
all the help he can get.

23:48.688 --> 23:51.212
- You're late.
- Sorry.

23:51.255 --> 23:52.996
Couldn't find the gloves.

23:54.389 --> 23:56.435
We're on Colin's boat?

23:56.478 --> 23:57.479
Yeah.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.699
Taking in some traps today.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.485
Team effort.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.522
What's going on?

24:40.566 --> 24:42.698
- We know
what you've been doing.

24:44.395 --> 24:45.658
I don't know what you mean.

24:45.701 --> 24:47.747
Don't lie to me, man.

24:47.790 --> 24:51.228
You sold 200 pounds of our haul
in Chester.

24:51.272 --> 24:53.317
They told us.

24:53.361 --> 24:54.797
- I didn't take anything
from your traps.

24:54.841 --> 24:56.233
- No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

24:56.277 --> 24:57.844
Don't try to play us.

24:57.887 --> 25:00.542
- Those are my traps.
It was my haul.

25:00.586 --> 25:03.545
Look...

25:03.589 --> 25:05.025
All right,

25:05.068 --> 25:07.331
I took your boat out
with my dad a couple times.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.464
I knew it.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.335
Fished our permits.

25:11.379 --> 25:12.946
I should have told you, okay?

25:12.989 --> 25:14.774
But I never took
from your traps.

25:14.817 --> 25:16.602
- Our hauls have been light
for the past month.

25:16.645 --> 25:17.733
- Yeah, well,
that's not on me.

25:17.777 --> 25:19.082
That's just
what's out there.

25:19.126 --> 25:20.867
You owe us 2 grand,

25:20.910 --> 25:22.521
everything you got in Chester.

25:22.564 --> 25:24.827
- I don't owe you shit.
I wasn't skimming.

25:27.134 --> 25:31.007
All right, look, okay?

25:31.051 --> 25:33.619
I should've told you
about the boat.

25:33.662 --> 25:39.189
It's just, I ask
and you always say no.

25:39.233 --> 25:43.454
- I'll pay you for the gas.
- Oh, fuck you.

25:43.498 --> 25:44.717
Don't touch me.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.502
- You're a lying
piece of shit.

25:47.546 --> 25:48.938
I did you a favor
hiring you.

25:48.982 --> 25:50.592
- I trained you.
- A favor?

25:50.636 --> 25:52.028
You barely pay a living wage.

25:52.072 --> 25:53.595
- We pay what
everybody else pays.

25:53.639 --> 25:55.945
Yeah, and it sucks!

25:55.989 --> 25:57.338
So get your own fucking boat!

25:57.381 --> 25:58.818
How can we?

25:58.861 --> 26:00.689
You guys own
all the permits.

26:00.733 --> 26:01.995
What are we supposed to do,
huh,

26:02.038 --> 26:04.737
wait in line
for 15 years?

26:04.780 --> 26:05.781
And pay with what?

26:05.825 --> 26:06.956
That's not our problem.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.611
- Fuck you.
We don't owe you--

26:09.655 --> 26:11.482
You are done here.

26:11.526 --> 26:13.310
Your whole family.
You are done here.

26:13.354 --> 26:15.312
Fuck you.

26:15.356 --> 26:17.314
Dad!

26:17.358 --> 26:18.489
You fuck.

26:20.796 --> 26:22.058
- You don't touch me.
You hear me?

26:22.102 --> 26:23.538
Stop it!

26:23.582 --> 26:25.453
Okay, that's enough.

26:25.496 --> 26:27.716
- Oh, shit, Colin.
- Shit.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.283
- Fucking--
- Stop it!

26:29.326 --> 26:30.893
Fuck you!

26:30.937 --> 26:32.634
- Dad!
- You bring me out here,

26:32.678 --> 26:34.680
- fucking threaten me?
- Dad, Dad.

26:34.723 --> 26:36.725
Get off me.

26:36.769 --> 26:38.509
That haul was mine!

26:38.553 --> 26:40.207
It's our boat, our haul.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.341
- You don't own me.
You hear me?

26:44.385 --> 26:46.953
Get off of him.

26:46.996 --> 26:48.607
I said get--

27:14.807 --> 27:18.071
- I didn't mean to.
He wasn't stopping.

27:37.090 --> 27:39.745
- I'm gonna get the truck.
Make sure nobody sees.

27:46.273 --> 27:47.578
Get his legs.

27:56.457 --> 27:58.024
Ow!

27:59.939 --> 28:02.637
- Shit.
- What happened?

28:06.815 --> 28:09.296
My shoulder.

28:57.518 --> 28:59.346
I'm so sorry.

29:24.110 --> 29:27.026
Hello.

29:27.069 --> 29:28.592
Yes.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.234
I'm sorry.

30:01.277 --> 30:02.757
I'm so sorry.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.813
It was an accident.

30:17.641 --> 30:20.079
Nobody meant
this to happen.

30:20.731 --> 30:23.169
- What did you do
to him?

30:23.212 --> 30:24.910
It was me.

30:27.347 --> 30:30.263
I was trying to talk
to him and--

30:30.306 --> 30:33.875
- They wanted
to meet with Bo

30:33.919 --> 30:36.878
because there was an issue
with our count.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.271
It was low.

30:40.229 --> 30:42.231
And it seemed that Bo was--

30:45.060 --> 30:48.281
Was what?

30:48.324 --> 30:50.283
What?

30:51.284 --> 30:52.589
Things got heated.

30:52.633 --> 30:54.548
- It was me.
I did it.

30:54.591 --> 30:56.245
Percy, go upstairs.

30:56.289 --> 30:58.813
- I got the gun,
and I shot him.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.554
You shot him?

31:00.597 --> 31:02.948
- Upstairs!
Now!

31:04.427 --> 31:05.472
- What does she mean
she shot him?

31:05.515 --> 31:06.777
Please, I beg of you.

31:06.821 --> 31:09.606
She was trying to keep them
from fighting.

31:09.650 --> 31:13.349
And if you call the police--
she's young.

31:13.393 --> 31:16.178
Her whole life,

31:16.222 --> 31:17.876
it'll be ruined.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.359
My son is dead!

31:26.449 --> 31:29.409
It was a mistake.

31:29.452 --> 31:32.020
A horrible mistake.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.634
What can we do?

31:52.475 --> 31:55.435
- Just talk to her.
All right.

34:28.501 --> 34:31.852
- We agreed to it,
all of us.

34:31.895 --> 34:33.114
but that didn't
make it right.

34:34.985 --> 34:38.467
- In giving up
the permit,

34:38.511 --> 34:40.121
times must have gotten
even harder.

34:41.905 --> 34:46.606
So the smuggling, right,
that's when you turned to it,

34:46.649 --> 34:47.998
trying to make ends meet?

34:52.394 --> 34:55.136
- Yes.
- Sean, shut the fuck up!

34:56.833 --> 34:58.618
- They probably told you
those people,

34:58.661 --> 35:00.533
they wanted to be smuggled.

35:00.576 --> 35:02.665
You thought you were
being helpful.

35:02.709 --> 35:04.667
- We were lying
to ourselves.

35:04.711 --> 35:06.234
We knew the jobs
weren't any good.

35:06.278 --> 35:09.324
This isn't just about you.

35:09.368 --> 35:10.978
You can't do this.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.330
You can't.

35:15.374 --> 35:18.072
- Take me
to the station.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.422
I'll answer anything
anyone wants to know.

35:23.208 --> 35:25.166
You're on your own.

35:31.781 --> 35:34.567
You can't do this.

35:34.610 --> 35:37.135
Sean!

35:37.178 --> 35:39.833
Get out of the car.

35:39.876 --> 35:42.662
I said get out
of the car.

35:42.705 --> 35:44.229
You're not doing this.

35:46.231 --> 35:48.058
Sean!

35:48.102 --> 35:49.538
Open the door.

35:49.582 --> 35:51.410
I said open the door!

35:51.453 --> 35:53.194
Let's go.

35:54.848 --> 35:57.242
- Don't you dare move this car!
You hear me?

36:00.375 --> 36:03.509
Sean, please.

36:03.552 --> 36:05.946
Think of your brother.
Think of me.

36:07.817 --> 36:09.863
We're gonna lose everything.

36:11.604 --> 36:13.171
Please.

36:15.738 --> 36:17.610
It's what you wanted.

36:29.665 --> 36:31.363
Let's go, please.

37:12.839 --> 37:15.015
<i>- Hi. </i>
You've reached Sonya Barzel.

37:15.058 --> 37:16.756
<i>Please leave a message. </i>
Thanks.

37:25.330 --> 37:28.071
<i>Sorry to interrupt.</i>

37:28.115 --> 37:31.118
No bad news.
I promise.

37:36.732 --> 37:39.257
I'm so sorry to learn
about what happened to Bo,

37:39.300 --> 37:40.693
to your son.

37:42.172 --> 37:44.436
I want you to know that I spoke
to the district attorney,

37:44.479 --> 37:46.699
and the state has agreed
not to pursue charges

37:46.742 --> 37:50.790
of any cover-up
of your son's death.

37:50.833 --> 37:52.792
I'll just need a statement
when you're ready.

37:57.449 --> 38:00.408
Otherwise, you have
nothing to worry about.

38:00.452 --> 38:02.541
- We have many things
to worry about.

38:04.020 --> 38:06.153
- Right.
Of course.

38:09.635 --> 38:12.290
Lou...

38:12.333 --> 38:13.769
thank you.

38:24.214 --> 38:26.304
Look...

38:26.347 --> 38:28.654
I know it's not
gonna bring your son back,

38:28.697 --> 38:32.571
but I think...

38:32.614 --> 38:34.268
Percy spent
the rest of her life

38:34.312 --> 38:37.184
wishing she could undo
what she did.

38:53.374 --> 38:56.203
- What did Percy
have to do with Bo?

39:02.557 --> 39:03.950
CJ...

39:05.517 --> 39:09.216
It wasn't an equipment accident
that killed your brother.

39:10.783 --> 39:12.262
There was a fight

39:12.306 --> 39:14.482
between Bo
and the Muldoons.

39:15.570 --> 39:17.485
Percy used a gun to stop it.

39:20.749 --> 39:22.534
Oh, my God.

39:22.577 --> 39:24.187
That's why I was so upset

39:24.231 --> 39:25.841
when I saw
the two of you together.

39:27.103 --> 39:28.278
I'm sorry.

39:33.458 --> 39:35.416
- So your deal,
it wasn't to save them

39:35.460 --> 39:37.200
from reckless endangerment
charges.

39:37.244 --> 39:38.680
You covered up his murder?

39:40.682 --> 39:42.989
- It wasn't to save them
from anything.

39:45.295 --> 39:46.775
How could you do that?

39:50.344 --> 39:52.390
- We thought we were
protecting you.

39:53.826 --> 39:58.178
- We did it for you,
for your future.

40:06.447 --> 40:09.537
So this is it, huh?

40:09.581 --> 40:12.322
- Yeah, I'm catching
the ferry tomorrow.

40:12.366 --> 40:15.413
Ah.

40:15.456 --> 40:17.589
I don't know
how to thank you.

40:19.242 --> 40:22.594
You taught me...a lot.

40:26.685 --> 40:28.295
Hmm.

40:30.515 --> 40:33.866
Almond. Roca. Buttercrunch.
Incredible.

40:33.909 --> 40:35.998
You can buy them at Dory Mates'
seafood shop.

40:36.042 --> 40:37.565
You will lose your mind.

40:42.222 --> 40:45.094
Don't be a stranger.

40:45.138 --> 40:46.966
Drop me a line sometime.

41:46.329 --> 41:48.114
- I saw your car
parked outside.

41:52.684 --> 41:55.382
I know this has gotta
be hard for you.

41:58.820 --> 42:00.648
- Well, you got
what you want.

42:00.692 --> 42:02.520
Hope you're satisfied.

42:03.912 --> 42:08.700
- I was just trying
for some justice for Percy.

42:10.963 --> 42:13.139
- You know, it doesn't feel
like justice.

42:17.186 --> 42:19.885
- I came to you first,
like you asked.

42:22.496 --> 42:24.280
We both wanted the truth.

42:24.324 --> 42:27.196
- You didn't have
to keep going.

42:27.240 --> 42:28.850
You could have stopped

42:28.894 --> 42:31.549
once you saw
what it would do to us.

42:33.246 --> 42:35.683
You know I couldn't do that.

42:35.727 --> 42:38.686
- So you think the world's
a better place now

42:38.730 --> 42:40.862
because of what you did?

42:47.173 --> 42:48.957
I'm not sure.

43:06.714 --> 43:08.542
Thought you should have that.

43:26.691 --> 43:31.043
I've been coming
to this church for 68 years,

43:31.086 --> 43:33.088
asking for his guidance.

43:35.525 --> 43:39.094
I've never heard
a fucking word back.

44:12.301 --> 44:14.782
- Thanks, Josh.
I'll take it from here.

44:37.109 --> 44:38.284
- You're lucky
Lou wasn't there.

44:38.327 --> 44:39.459
- I'm lucky?
- Next time you want to talk

44:39.502 --> 44:40.503
to strangers
about something

44:40.547 --> 44:41.548
you don't know
anything about,

44:41.591 --> 44:42.723
- you come to us.
- I can't believe

44:42.767 --> 44:44.246
- you would even--
- Keep your voice down.

44:44.290 --> 44:46.640
We didn't have a choice.

44:46.684 --> 44:48.424
- If you say anything
to her about this,

44:48.468 --> 44:49.338
you're gonna
make her sick again.

44:49.382 --> 44:50.644
Is that what you want?

44:50.688 --> 44:53.386
- Say any of what to me?
I'm not an invalid.

44:53.429 --> 44:55.344
What's going on?

45:03.048 --> 45:05.659
What happened
to your head?

45:05.703 --> 45:07.052
It's nothing.

45:10.577 --> 45:12.579
- Why was Josh Moore
dropping you off?

45:16.235 --> 45:19.281
- Percy's freaking out
about Bo Lam again.

45:19.325 --> 45:22.241
Yeah, she almost came out
with all of it.

45:22.284 --> 45:23.503
Luckily, she chickened out.

45:23.546 --> 45:25.505
Oh, my God, Percy.

45:32.599 --> 45:34.949
- This family
makes me sick.

45:36.298 --> 45:38.083
What's gotten into you?

45:38.126 --> 45:40.738
We're supposed to be
past this now.

45:42.261 --> 45:44.306
We're poisoned,

45:44.350 --> 45:46.787
all of us.

45:46.831 --> 45:48.267
And it's all because
of what I did to Bo.

45:48.310 --> 45:49.355
It's ruined us.

45:49.398 --> 45:51.444
Don't be dramatic.

45:51.487 --> 45:52.750
We're not ruined.

45:52.793 --> 45:55.274
Look at you.

45:55.317 --> 45:56.971
You say you know God?

45:58.451 --> 46:01.062
You can't even own
the decisions you've made.

46:03.021 --> 46:05.110
And you.

46:06.633 --> 46:08.156
Tell her.

46:10.115 --> 46:11.769
Tell her what you do
in the garage.

46:14.859 --> 46:16.295
I'm no better.

46:18.863 --> 46:21.779
I've ruined
the Lams' lives.

46:21.822 --> 46:22.910
I've ruined the Lams' lives,

46:22.954 --> 46:25.434
and I never did anything
to make it right.

46:25.478 --> 46:27.088
- We did a lot for them,
actually.

46:27.132 --> 46:30.091
Like a permit fixes anything?

46:30.135 --> 46:31.919
And now the business is failing
because of it.

46:31.963 --> 46:34.226
- I don't understand
why this is happening now.

46:34.269 --> 46:36.228
- Because I go around
every day

46:36.271 --> 46:37.882
pretending
that I'm innocent,

46:37.925 --> 46:39.622
and I can't stand it anymore.

46:45.150 --> 46:49.284
Everywhere I go I see him.
He follows me.

46:53.985 --> 46:57.553
- Maybe it was just too soon
for you to go back to work.

46:57.597 --> 47:00.165
Grams.

47:00.208 --> 47:04.691
Grams, I have to go to Lou.
Okay?

47:04.734 --> 47:07.302
I need to.
Please, it's the only thing.

47:07.346 --> 47:08.913
It's the only thing
that'd make it right.

47:08.956 --> 47:10.740
- I have to go.
- You've gotta stop.

47:10.784 --> 47:13.352
- I have to go,
or I'm gonna go crazy.

47:13.395 --> 47:15.093
Please, please.

47:15.136 --> 47:16.834
- If you go to Lou--
if you go to Lou,

47:16.877 --> 47:18.661
- you're gonna ruin us.
- Grams, I need to.

47:18.705 --> 47:21.577
The business, me,

47:21.621 --> 47:24.363
Colin, your father.

47:29.020 --> 47:30.369
Dad...

47:34.373 --> 47:35.896
Say something.

47:47.212 --> 47:50.737
- Promise me you will not go
to the police.

47:54.654 --> 47:56.786
- It wouldn't fix
anything anyway.

48:48.795 --> 48:50.666
- You wanted
to say goodbye?

48:52.320 --> 48:54.583
Something like that.

48:56.890 --> 48:58.674
- Do you understand
it all now?

49:00.459 --> 49:02.374
Why I jumped?

49:04.419 --> 49:05.986
- Trying to put
it all together.

49:08.119 --> 49:10.425
You were one
of those people

49:10.469 --> 49:12.819
whose whole life
was mapped out for them.

49:14.734 --> 49:18.781
But when that gun
went off,

49:18.825 --> 49:20.740
everything veered
off course.

49:24.048 --> 49:27.007
<i>You wanted to come clean,</i>

49:27.051 --> 49:30.445
<i>but your family </i>
made you stuff it all down.

49:31.881 --> 49:32.970
Right.

49:34.797 --> 49:37.975
So I tried to escape
the only way I knew how.

49:39.193 --> 49:40.412
<i>That never works.</i>

49:40.455 --> 49:42.805
<i>No, it doesn't.</i>

49:44.503 --> 49:49.247
You--you went to CJ.

49:49.290 --> 49:51.553
<i>You wanted to confess.</i>

49:51.597 --> 49:53.033
<i>But I was too scared.</i>

49:53.077 --> 49:56.819
<i>And I only ended up </i>
making everything worse.

49:59.083 --> 50:01.302
I needed to leave the island.

50:02.347 --> 50:06.655
- And the only person who could
see that was your father.

50:11.443 --> 50:13.923
<i>But your family </i>
couldn't let you go.

50:19.494 --> 50:21.931
- I don't understand.
Why didn't they help me?

50:24.108 --> 50:25.935
<i>They thought they were.</i>

50:28.851 --> 50:32.072
<i>You realized that you needed </i>
to look somewhere else.

50:33.378 --> 50:35.510
<i>To something more honest.</i>

50:38.165 --> 50:40.341
Do you think that I found it?

50:42.082 --> 50:43.388
You were getting there.

50:50.395 --> 50:52.353
Then why was it so hard?

50:55.008 --> 50:56.531
That stuff's hard.

50:58.881 --> 51:01.754
You have
to finally see yourself.

51:03.843 --> 51:10.023
<i>You have to see what's really </i>
happening all around you.

51:10.067 --> 51:13.418
<i>You looked, </i>
and all of a sudden,

51:13.461 --> 51:15.159
<i>everyone was against you.</i>

51:17.900 --> 51:21.034
<i>Your whole family </i>
was poisoned,

51:21.078 --> 51:24.429
<i>and you could only </i>
blame yourself for it all.

51:25.430 --> 51:27.693
- Do you--

51:27.736 --> 51:29.564
Who was on the bluff
with me, then?

51:29.608 --> 51:33.394
There--there was someone.

51:38.486 --> 51:41.054
No.

51:41.098 --> 51:42.534
You were alone.

51:55.199 --> 51:57.331
<i>But he was here with you.</i>

51:57.375 --> 51:59.899
It was Bo.

51:59.942 --> 52:03.511
<i>He was the one who was </i>
following you all along.

52:05.209 --> 52:07.559
<i>And when you looked back,</i>

52:07.602 --> 52:09.952
<i>you saw him.</i>

52:27.970 --> 52:30.103
I know
what that feels like.

52:32.453 --> 52:34.716
You try and try...

52:38.981 --> 52:41.593
But those feelings,
they still crush you.

52:44.030 --> 52:45.727
And...

52:48.077 --> 52:50.645
You just want
to leave it all behind.

52:54.823 --> 52:57.086
You just gotta get
some relief.

53:02.309 --> 53:05.443
That day I met you

53:05.486 --> 53:09.490
down by the docks...

53:09.534 --> 53:12.189
that's what you were thinking.

53:15.061 --> 53:17.977
Yeah.

53:24.375 --> 53:25.985
And now?

53:28.205 --> 53:29.554
Do you see another way?
