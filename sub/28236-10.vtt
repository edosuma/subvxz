00:04.720 --> 00:06.470
Previously on Billions...

00:06.470 --> 00:08.595
Dr. Rhoades, your medical
license is under review.

00:08.595 --> 00:10.136
I'm sorry. Why?

00:10.136 --> 00:12.220
There have been
accusations of malpractice.

00:12.220 --> 00:14.220
You reported me
to the Medical Board?

00:14.220 --> 00:15.553
Yes, I did.

00:15.553 --> 00:17.553
Are you going to say
it wasn't warranted?

00:17.553 --> 00:20.762
Help me, Chuck,
or I'm fucking lost.

00:20.762 --> 00:22.095
Make them drop the inquest?

00:22.095 --> 00:24.011
Is something you can do.

00:24.011 --> 00:25.887
Tomorrow is
Rebecca Cantu's first day

00:25.887 --> 00:27.220
as CEO of Saler's.

00:27.220 --> 00:29.512
I want it to be
a bad one for her.

00:29.512 --> 00:31.512
I'm going to need to withdraw
from the board.

00:31.512 --> 00:33.345
Me, too.
How come?

00:33.345 --> 00:34.679
We sold our shares.

00:34.679 --> 00:35.720
Who'd you sell to?

00:35.720 --> 00:37.470
Taylor Mason.

00:37.470 --> 00:39.053
I'm here to apply for a wiretap.

00:39.053 --> 00:40.720
On Chuck Rhoades,
for public corruption.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.970
The relationship between
the good judge and Mr. Rhoades

00:42.970 --> 00:44.679
is all the more reason
why the wire is needed.

00:44.679 --> 00:45.845
Well played.

00:45.845 --> 00:47.303
You have your wire.

00:47.303 --> 00:52.345
I have run into a financing snag
with my development.

00:52.345 --> 00:54.762
So how are we going to
skin this...

00:54.762 --> 00:58.053
Now have a seat, Mr. Secretary,
we have much to discuss.

00:58.053 --> 00:59.762
Positive news, Dad.

00:59.762 --> 01:02.220
Qatar State Bank is going to be
taken off the restricted list

01:02.220 --> 01:04.512
and it's ready to give you
a sweetheart of a loan.

01:04.512 --> 01:06.428
Are you sure about this?

01:06.428 --> 01:08.679
Got it straight from
the Secretary Of The Treasury.

01:08.679 --> 01:11.261
In the last year,
your house was paid off.

01:11.261 --> 01:13.970
Yeah, my wife
came into some money.

01:13.970 --> 01:17.428
I'm sorry, do you...
do you want a towel, or...

01:17.428 --> 01:19.261
I'm good.

01:19.261 --> 01:20.637
The Medical Board...

01:20.637 --> 01:22.261
I'm sorry, Wend.

01:22.261 --> 01:23.970
You're gonna have to
take your chances with them.

01:23.970 --> 01:26.220
Then I know it couldn't be done.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:55.595 --> 01:57.637
The bank I moved
off the restricted list...

01:57.637 --> 01:59.220
Qatar State Bank...

01:59.220 --> 02:00.512
That's right.
A report came in.

02:00.512 --> 02:02.136
I'm gonna have to move it

02:02.136 --> 02:03.220
back onto the restricted list.

02:03.220 --> 02:05.095
Shit.

02:05.095 --> 02:07.136
We need to meet.
Your father too.

02:07.136 --> 02:09.303
How about New Year's Day?

02:09.303 --> 02:11.595
Things will be quiet...

02:26.720 --> 02:28.011
Happy New Year.

02:28.011 --> 02:30.512
Totally.
And to you.

02:30.512 --> 02:32.095
Just how I planned to spend it.

02:33.303 --> 02:34.720
Where'd he pull you from?

02:34.720 --> 02:36.011
Turks. You?

02:36.011 --> 02:37.512
St. Barths.

02:37.512 --> 02:38.679
I don't mind.

02:38.679 --> 02:40.261
If it wasn't for this job,
the only way

02:40.261 --> 02:42.261
I'd see St. Barths
is on the Travel Channel.

02:42.261 --> 02:44.178
If I could afford cable.
Come on.

03:03.804 --> 03:05.970
I can win, right?

03:05.970 --> 03:09.011
We wouldn't be prepping
if we didn't think...

03:09.011 --> 03:10.095
Shit.

03:10.095 --> 03:12.512
You don't think I can win.

03:12.512 --> 03:15.261
Would Axe be Skyping in if
he didn't think there was a...

03:15.261 --> 03:17.512
Better if he were here.

03:17.512 --> 03:21.428
Always is. But the boys
had their hearts set on Fiji.

03:21.428 --> 03:24.053
Skype is not the same.

03:24.053 --> 03:25.470
But I guess it'll be fine.

03:25.470 --> 03:27.470
Has to be better than fine.

03:27.470 --> 03:29.970
You've got to treat today
like the real thing.

03:29.970 --> 03:31.595
We're going to
make it hard on you.

03:31.595 --> 03:33.261
Because when you face
the Medical Board,

03:33.261 --> 03:35.762
and your license is at stake,
it'll be brutal.

03:35.762 --> 03:37.512
These are smart people.

03:37.512 --> 03:39.053
Can I win?

03:39.053 --> 03:41.929
You have to convince the Board
that your work with Taylor,

03:41.929 --> 03:45.428
with all the people here, isn't
part of your medical practice.

03:45.428 --> 03:46.762
That the sessions aren't.

03:46.762 --> 03:49.720
That they are
performance coaching sessions.

03:49.720 --> 03:52.595
That Taylor wasn't a patient,
but rather a client,

03:52.595 --> 03:55.762
who doesn't enjoy
doctor-patient confidentiality...

03:55.762 --> 03:57.553
Orrin.

03:57.553 --> 03:59.970
Can. I. Win?

03:59.970 --> 04:02.261
I'll let you know
when we're done today.

04:12.762 --> 04:16.428
Old friends become enemies,
old enemies become new...

04:16.428 --> 04:18.178
We were never friends.

04:18.178 --> 04:20.011
So, when do we get
this thing started...

04:20.011 --> 04:21.595
I know: you only have
the morning to give...

04:21.595 --> 04:24.387
No. I'm eager. Eager to get you
free of this, is all.

04:24.387 --> 04:26.970
As long as it can be
'accomplished by midday repast.'

04:28.553 --> 04:30.804
Well, we're all here,
so let's get started... Mm.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.970
Well.
It's about time.

04:32.970 --> 04:34.970
Been waiting on you.

04:34.970 --> 04:37.679
You're here!

04:37.679 --> 04:40.470
Let's win this thing.

04:45.845 --> 04:48.303
Yeah.
Helo landed a few hours ago.

04:48.303 --> 04:49.929
The waves were a little big.

04:49.929 --> 04:51.178
Gordie got scraped on a coral.

04:51.178 --> 04:53.345
Deanie's surfboard
got broken in half.

04:53.345 --> 04:55.553
We have front-row seats at
the Rangers game tomorrow,

04:55.553 --> 04:57.303
they were happy
to bug out of there.

05:06.470 --> 05:09.637
You weren't expected to be here.

05:09.637 --> 05:12.011
Fair enough.

05:12.011 --> 05:15.512
Dr. Rhoades,
we're holding this inquest

05:15.512 --> 05:17.345
over your severe
ethics violation

05:17.345 --> 05:19.804
and misuse of patient records.

05:19.804 --> 05:22.845
Tell us about the nature of
your sessions with Taylor Mason.

05:22.845 --> 05:25.095
I never discuss what I talk
about with patients.

05:25.095 --> 05:26.845
So Taylor was your patient?

05:26.845 --> 05:29.345
If we find there was
a breach, it was a breach of

05:29.345 --> 05:31.178
doctor-patient
confidentiality then.

05:31.178 --> 05:32.178
Client.
I meant client.

05:32.178 --> 05:34.220
Taylor was a client

05:34.220 --> 05:36.929
in my performance enhancement
practice.

05:40.428 --> 05:42.512
We have to assume
Wendy Rhoades will be

05:42.512 --> 05:44.720
buttoned down, focused,
primed to go.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.929
I rattled her.
She was rattled.

05:46.929 --> 05:48.387
And then I rattled her.

05:48.387 --> 05:50.220
But I suspect, as Sara does,
that Wendy will rally.

05:50.220 --> 05:52.053
And that she'll slay.

05:52.053 --> 05:53.553
So we have to slay harder.

05:53.553 --> 05:54.929
You do, Taylor.

05:54.929 --> 05:56.470
Tell me to slay, I'll slay.

05:56.470 --> 05:58.303
Let's get into it.

06:00.136 --> 06:02.387
Slayed me last night.

06:02.387 --> 06:04.970
What did you all do
for New Year's Eve?

06:06.303 --> 06:08.679
I mostly stayed in
and did some reading.

06:08.679 --> 06:09.929
Same.

06:09.929 --> 06:11.762
You stayed in.
That doesn't sound like...

06:11.762 --> 06:13.345
Not same.

06:13.345 --> 06:15.053
I just mean, I didn't do much.

06:15.053 --> 06:17.387
Amateur night, you know?

06:17.387 --> 06:19.720
I prefer to party on the nights
they're not out.

06:19.720 --> 06:23.762
So I just hit a diner...
with some friends.

06:23.762 --> 06:25.553
A friend.

06:25.553 --> 06:28.845
Ahh, I wish I'd known you were
just chilling, Lauren.

06:32.637 --> 06:35.095
Happy New Year!
Right?

06:36.261 --> 06:40.261
Hello.

06:40.261 --> 06:42.053
This is Lonnie Watley.

06:42.053 --> 06:43.720
He was a star under Rhoades
at SDNY.

06:43.720 --> 06:46.303
Chuck trained me.
I worked closely with him.

06:46.303 --> 06:48.929
I can tell you: if he is
preparing his wife

06:48.929 --> 06:51.095
for the hearing,
she will be well-prepped.

06:51.095 --> 06:52.220
She will be ready to kill.

06:52.220 --> 06:54.178
And she will say absolutely

06:54.178 --> 06:56.845
anything she needs to,
in order to win.

06:56.845 --> 06:58.470
True or not.

06:58.470 --> 07:00.220
What is your relationship
with them now?

07:00.220 --> 07:02.261
I need to know that...
Do they have hooks in me?

07:02.261 --> 07:04.720
No. They don't.

07:04.720 --> 07:07.220
Sara relayed to me what happened
between you and Wendy.

07:07.220 --> 07:09.011
And my experience was similar.

07:09.011 --> 07:11.220
Brought close
just to be expelled.

07:11.220 --> 07:12.762
Like Sammy Hagar in Van Halen.

07:12.762 --> 07:15.845
Because, in the end,
the Rhoades' only really

07:15.845 --> 07:17.261
take care of the Rhoades'.

07:17.261 --> 07:19.303
Sounds a lot like the Axelrods.

07:19.303 --> 07:21.303
Either way, let's go get 'em.

07:21.303 --> 07:23.637
We will.
But you should know:

07:23.637 --> 07:26.053
if you pursue this
it's not risk-free for you.

07:26.053 --> 07:28.011
I'm not afraid of
an attack from them...

07:28.011 --> 07:30.136
If you appear
and testify against Wendy,

07:30.136 --> 07:31.804
they could introduce
information about you,

07:31.804 --> 07:33.637
information that you
don't want out there.

07:33.637 --> 07:36.345
Shit gets written down.
Leaks happen.

07:36.345 --> 07:39.136
Suddenly your character and
your conduct's being questioned.

07:39.136 --> 07:41.053
That's how they roll.

07:41.053 --> 07:42.428
We don't need our investors

07:42.428 --> 07:43.762
learning about
your personal demons...

07:43.762 --> 07:45.387
Is this something you want to
consider, Taylor?

07:45.387 --> 07:48.011
It's worth considering...

07:48.011 --> 07:50.470
And now we have.
We may come back to it.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.887
But first, let's figure out

07:51.887 --> 07:53.679
how to strip Wendy
of her goddamn license.

07:53.679 --> 07:56.512
You know how we win?
'Cause I know how we win.

07:56.512 --> 07:57.970
We make it so Taylor
doesn't show up.

07:57.970 --> 08:00.095
They stop cooperating
with the Medical Board.

08:00.095 --> 08:02.011
It's true,
if Taylor didn't appear,

08:02.011 --> 08:03.595
or refused to state,
on the record,

08:03.595 --> 08:06.303
what Wendy did...
This matter disappears.

08:06.303 --> 08:07.553
That's not going to happen,
though.

08:07.553 --> 08:09.553
Well. Maybe I could
induce it to happen.

08:09.553 --> 08:11.345
Offer them something they need.

08:11.345 --> 08:13.929
Create leverage.
You know, what I do.

08:13.929 --> 08:15.679
Oooh...
I can't recommend...

08:15.679 --> 08:17.053
Risky move, Bobby.

08:17.053 --> 08:18.637
Agreed.
If Taylor doesn't go for it,

08:18.637 --> 08:21.303
and instead takes it to
the Board, we're fucked worse.

08:21.303 --> 08:23.845
Well, Charl, none of this would
have happened in the first place

08:23.845 --> 08:25.762
if you would have done
what you were asked.

08:25.762 --> 08:27.053
Taylor should be dealing with

08:27.053 --> 08:28.679
their own legal problems
right now...

08:28.679 --> 08:31.220
Oh. I hardly think I'm to blame
on this one, Bub.

08:31.220 --> 08:33.345
Your gang war resulted
in extra bodies...

08:33.345 --> 08:35.845
Stop.

08:35.845 --> 08:37.679
Taylor won't be bought,
won't be moved,

08:37.679 --> 08:39.386
and trying will only
make it worse.

08:39.386 --> 08:42.511
I can't let anyone engage
and ask them to drop it.

08:42.511 --> 08:45.553
I won't give Taylor
the fucking satisfaction.

08:45.553 --> 08:49.261
Sorry to pull you out,
but, uh, there's an issue.

08:49.261 --> 08:51.512
Mm.

09:01.637 --> 09:03.470
What do you got?

09:04.887 --> 09:06.095
Fuck me.

09:06.095 --> 09:07.553
What is it?

09:07.553 --> 09:09.261
A shitty New Year's present.

09:09.261 --> 09:10.887
It's a Picasso... Boy With Pipe.

09:10.887 --> 09:12.553
It's also a huge
fucking tax problem.

09:12.553 --> 09:14.512
Once you sign that, I've got
seventeen more crates

09:14.512 --> 09:16.595
scheduled to come to you
after the holiday.

09:16.595 --> 09:18.595
I'm not signing that.

09:18.595 --> 09:21.053
Well. You got to.
To take possession.

09:21.053 --> 09:22.762
You busy today?

09:22.762 --> 09:24.470
No, but I'd like to be done.
You know.

09:24.470 --> 09:26.178
Go home and watch a bowl game.

09:26.178 --> 09:29.261
Oh, yeah, sure.

09:29.261 --> 09:34.261
That is a thousand bucks...

09:34.261 --> 09:37.512
And a few more for them...

09:37.512 --> 09:39.387
I need you to wait here awhile.

09:39.387 --> 09:42.720
Ho, a day changer.
Alright.

09:42.720 --> 09:45.637
Okay.

09:45.637 --> 09:48.261
Get him a chair, a coffee,
some food... whatever he wants.

09:48.261 --> 09:49.929
Set up the game
on the laptop for him.

09:49.929 --> 09:51.595
This may take a minute.

09:54.762 --> 09:57.762
Right now that painting
and 17 others like it

09:57.762 --> 10:00.011
are gonna run over me
like a Mack truck.

10:00.011 --> 10:03.595
I need you to get Sean Ayles in
here now... this is his fuck-up.

10:03.595 --> 10:04.929
Not that he'll be
able to solve it.

10:04.929 --> 10:06.720
So get Victor in here too.
Fast.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.762
I will.

10:13.053 --> 10:14.720
Judge Funt.

10:14.720 --> 10:17.887
Even though court is closed,
justice never slumbers.

10:17.887 --> 10:20.637
At the SDNY, we are always
open for business.

10:21.637 --> 10:23.929
And I'll play you today's.

10:27.720 --> 10:29.387
The bank I moved
off the restricted list...

10:29.387 --> 10:30.679
Qatar State Bank...

10:30.679 --> 10:32.220
That's right.
A report came in.

10:32.220 --> 10:33.553
I'm gonna have to move it

10:33.553 --> 10:34.720
back onto the restricted list.

10:34.720 --> 10:36.220
Shit.

10:36.220 --> 10:37.762
We need to meet.
Your father too.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.804
How about New Year's Day?

10:39.804 --> 10:41.261
Things will be quiet...

10:43.512 --> 10:45.762
The wiretaps on their telephones
are no longer enough.

10:45.762 --> 10:47.553
We need to step up surveillance.

10:47.553 --> 10:50.011
As you heard, Judge,
they're going to meet in person

10:50.011 --> 10:53.011
in pursuit of their crimes
and we need to be listening.

10:54.637 --> 10:57.011
The Title III intercept request.

11:00.929 --> 11:03.512
I'm going to deny
bugging the NYAG office,

11:03.512 --> 11:05.762
that's outside the pale.

11:05.762 --> 11:09.512
But I'll grant... reluctantly...

11:09.512 --> 11:13.178
Transmission bugs on Chuck
and Rhoades Sr.'s residences.

11:13.178 --> 11:14.595
Not the bedrooms.

11:14.595 --> 11:17.512
Home offices,
living spaces only.

11:17.512 --> 11:19.553
Major conditions
come along with this,

11:19.553 --> 11:21.095
on what you can listen to.

11:21.095 --> 11:22.679
Of course.

11:22.679 --> 11:26.887
Anything not case related,
and it's headphones off.

11:26.887 --> 11:30.762
And if a lawyer is present, then
the recording stops absolutely

11:30.762 --> 11:33.553
to protect attorney-client
privilege.

11:33.553 --> 11:35.470
We'll put in a taint team...

11:35.470 --> 11:37.887
An FBI agent and an
Assistant US Attorney here...

11:37.887 --> 11:39.303
Who will decide what is within

11:39.303 --> 11:41.136
and what is outside
the scope of privilege.

11:41.136 --> 11:42.929
Good.

11:42.929 --> 11:46.011
They only pass on what
you're allowed to hear.

11:46.011 --> 11:49.887
You violate this, your case
is on a road to nowhere.

11:49.887 --> 11:51.720
Thank you, Judge.

11:58.220 --> 12:00.595
Ah. Good day for you
and your case...

12:00.595 --> 12:02.011
Dancshazy can pick the agent...

12:02.011 --> 12:04.095
...you'll run the taint team.

12:04.095 --> 12:06.845
Hold up.
That idea is nicht gut.

12:06.845 --> 12:08.845
It's supposed to be somebody
not involved with the case...

12:08.845 --> 12:10.261
You're not.
I'm running the case.

12:12.387 --> 12:14.845
You oversaw a surveillance,

12:14.845 --> 12:16.720
sat in on a meeting or two,
loose facts.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.220
You're unbiased.

12:18.220 --> 12:19.929
We both know that I have done
more than that,

12:19.929 --> 12:21.929
but you better believe
that I am unbiased.

12:21.929 --> 12:23.595
And you'd better not
be expecting to play

12:23.595 --> 12:25.762
the wink and nudge game with me.

12:25.762 --> 12:27.762
Or that I'll compromise
my integrity.

12:27.762 --> 12:31.095
It's because I know
you won't compromise, Kate.

12:31.095 --> 12:33.095
Anyone else in that office
I could force to bend over.

12:33.095 --> 12:34.053
You won't.

12:34.053 --> 12:35.595
Damn straight I won't.

12:35.595 --> 12:37.637
Because I am not going to jail.

12:37.637 --> 12:40.762
And I'm not coming to visit you
there either.

12:40.762 --> 12:43.428
Give me Agent Dancshazy's
extension,

12:43.428 --> 12:45.804
I want his top Tac-Ops team

12:45.804 --> 12:47.470
planting those bugs
right away...

12:55.595 --> 12:58.637
Fact pattern:
A patient enters,

12:58.637 --> 13:02.178
complaining of an elevated HR,
say, two hundred and ten BPM.

13:02.178 --> 13:03.512
Now, you suspect that

13:03.512 --> 13:05.679
he has been doing
some kind of narcotic.

13:05.679 --> 13:09.095
What is your obligato
per the Hippocratic?

13:10.637 --> 13:11.929
Narcotics bring
the heart rate down.

13:11.929 --> 13:13.428
That's why they're called
downers.

13:13.428 --> 13:14.679
Jesus, Spyros.

13:14.679 --> 13:17.470
I don't know this Spyros
of whom you speak.

13:17.470 --> 13:20.720
I am Medical Doctor Rodizio,
as my name card clearly states...

13:20.720 --> 13:23.095
That's it, Spyros.
Now you've lost the coat.

13:23.095 --> 13:24.970
Take it off.

13:31.470 --> 13:32.970
That goes too.

13:38.345 --> 13:39.553
Back to it then.

13:39.553 --> 13:41.345
Isn't it so,
Ms. Rhoades...

13:41.345 --> 13:44.762
Dr. Rhoades.
Don't do that to them. No.

13:44.762 --> 13:46.595
Play through...
You play through...

13:46.595 --> 13:50.637
Isn't it true, Dr. Rhoades,

13:50.637 --> 13:52.178
that this isn't the first time

13:52.178 --> 13:53.970
your patient's notes
have been vulnerable

13:53.970 --> 13:55.929
and were used against
the patient themself?

13:55.929 --> 13:58.095
Sometime in the recent past
you were careless

13:58.095 --> 13:59.970
and someone in the US Attorney's
office got a hold of...

13:59.970 --> 14:01.679
Un-fucking-believable...

14:01.679 --> 14:02.845
- Whoa...
- Whoa...

14:02.845 --> 14:04.637
Whoa.
Whoa, hey, hold up.

14:04.637 --> 14:06.595
If you're going to
lose your poise that easily,

14:06.595 --> 14:07.720
I'll recommend you don't appear

14:07.720 --> 14:10.178
and take whatever decision
they hand out.

14:10.178 --> 14:12.053
It's like that commercial:
"never let 'em see you sweat."

14:12.053 --> 14:13.595
You've seen The Usual Suspects,

14:13.595 --> 14:15.345
only the guilty one can
sleep through the night.

14:15.345 --> 14:18.470
Nope. Ya gotta keep
as cool as a menthol.

14:18.470 --> 14:20.637
That's Kool with a K.

14:22.679 --> 14:24.345
Hey.

14:24.345 --> 14:25.553
Come on.

14:32.220 --> 14:36.887
You know. You're gonna have to
answer some of the questions.

14:36.887 --> 14:39.720
And also, go easy on Chuck, he's
merely doing what he's good at.

14:39.720 --> 14:41.887
Breaking my balls?

14:43.345 --> 14:44.845
Yeah.
He's loving it.

14:44.845 --> 14:46.887
Just another special talent
your man has.

14:46.887 --> 14:49.095
That's not what's
giving me trouble.

14:49.095 --> 14:51.095
Yeah?
What's the real problem?

14:51.095 --> 14:53.845
If Taylor was a patient,
I've committed violations.

14:53.845 --> 14:55.887
If Taylor was a performance
coaching 'client'

14:55.887 --> 14:57.762
and not a patient,
then I'm in the clear.

14:57.762 --> 14:59.679
Yeah.
No confidentiality.

14:59.679 --> 15:01.512
But then all the other
Axe Cappers I've seen

15:01.512 --> 15:02.804
are that as well.

15:02.804 --> 15:04.220
And what they've told me
isn't protected.

15:04.220 --> 15:06.136
So if they question me
about those sessions...

15:06.136 --> 15:08.804
Just share what you need
to get you out of this.

15:08.804 --> 15:11.095
Like Danzig's qualms about
wrecking a town.

15:11.095 --> 15:13.136
Dollar Bill's struggles
to gain inside information...

15:13.136 --> 15:15.303
Not whether or not to use it,
he's sanguine about that...

15:15.303 --> 15:17.345
But the challenge of getting it.

15:17.345 --> 15:19.762
Shell corps, shell funds,
dirty edge.

15:19.762 --> 15:21.887
Axe Cap hit squads
assembled to crush competitors,

15:21.887 --> 15:23.595
destroy businesses...
I get it.

15:23.595 --> 15:25.679
So, if those stories, those
'sessions, ' aren't protected,

15:25.679 --> 15:27.929
I could be subpoenaed
and dragged into depositions.

15:27.929 --> 15:30.303
Your best bet then
would be to fire me.

15:31.929 --> 15:33.303
It might be already.

15:33.303 --> 15:35.303
Not happening.

15:35.303 --> 15:38.303
We'd fight all that.
You shade it a bit.

15:38.303 --> 15:41.679
And, look, even if you took
a hit, the work doesn't change.

15:41.679 --> 15:43.303
Our team will still go see you.

15:43.303 --> 15:45.011
As long as the work is good,

15:45.011 --> 15:46.929
people look past this short-term
reputational bullshit.

15:46.929 --> 15:49.345
Steven Birch didn't.
His board didn't.

15:49.345 --> 15:51.512
He basically bounced me
out of his office...

15:51.512 --> 15:52.845
Why the fuck were you
talking to him?

15:52.845 --> 15:55.470
In trade.
Something for Chuck.

15:55.470 --> 15:57.136
And he threw you out?

15:57.136 --> 15:58.804
That motherfucker just went
back on my kill matrix.

15:58.804 --> 16:00.428
You really shouldn't have
one of those...

16:01.804 --> 16:03.637
Come on.
Let's go back in.

16:03.637 --> 16:05.261
Try to keep your cool.

16:06.845 --> 16:09.095
I know. I know,
coming from me, right?

16:09.095 --> 16:11.804
Were you having
psychological problems,

16:11.804 --> 16:13.470
is that why you saw
Wendy Rhoades?

16:13.470 --> 16:14.512
No.

16:14.512 --> 16:15.970
So it was business.

16:15.970 --> 16:18.011
You sought her out as
a performance coach.

16:18.011 --> 16:19.387
No.

16:19.387 --> 16:20.970
Then what was it?
What had you all messed up?

16:20.970 --> 16:22.804
Was it about
gender identification?

16:22.804 --> 16:25.845
Was it confusion, a crisis?

16:25.845 --> 16:27.595
My book was fine.

16:27.595 --> 16:28.887
And no, it had
nothing to do with

16:28.887 --> 16:30.679
my non-binary gender identity.

16:30.679 --> 16:32.345
I wasn't having
psychological problems...

16:32.345 --> 16:35.261
Just an issue I wanted to
discuss, privately, safely.

16:35.261 --> 16:38.011
So you were looking for a way
to salve your conscience,

16:38.011 --> 16:39.512
over all the illicit things
you had to do

16:39.512 --> 16:41.345
while in the employ
of Bobby Axelrod?

16:41.345 --> 16:43.553
The whole point is: that
whatever I was talking to her

16:43.553 --> 16:45.261
about was supposed
to be private.

16:45.261 --> 16:46.929
Because she wasn't
my performance coach,

16:46.929 --> 16:49.095
she was my doctor.
Dr. Rhoades.

16:49.095 --> 16:51.679
And the whole wing of medicine
is based on confidentiality.

16:51.679 --> 16:53.095
"And for the record,

16:53.095 --> 16:54.887
while the climate there
may have been corrupt,

16:54.887 --> 16:56.220
I never was."

16:56.220 --> 16:58.970
Exactly right.
I'll tack that on.

17:05.804 --> 17:09.095
I would wait on line
for exactly three things:

17:09.095 --> 17:13.053
One, the first batch of
new Lemmon 714 quaaludes

17:13.053 --> 17:14.428
coming off the assembly line,

17:14.428 --> 17:17.178
two, a chance to meet
Ellen DeGeneres

17:17.178 --> 17:19.970
and three, every time
I go to Miami,

17:19.970 --> 17:22.220
for some Joe's Stone Crabs.

17:22.220 --> 17:25.595
Which is to say: I come bearing
provisions and news.

17:25.595 --> 17:27.387
And a bit of a tan.

17:27.387 --> 17:29.345
Is the news as good
as the provisions?

17:29.345 --> 17:32.387
Well, while this lunch break
is in effect,

17:32.387 --> 17:34.595
perhaps we could
have a word, Wendy?

17:38.136 --> 17:41.178
I heard rumblings that Taylor
is making a move on Kling.

17:41.178 --> 17:43.261
It's an appliance manufacturer.

17:43.261 --> 17:45.261
I ran into the CEO at LIV.

17:45.261 --> 17:47.053
He said that Taylor
bought up a ton of stock

17:47.053 --> 17:49.178
right at the close
on the last day of the year.

17:49.178 --> 17:51.345
Kling is the major supplier
of Saler's.

17:51.345 --> 17:54.345
That's the one cash flow
lifeline left at the store.

17:54.345 --> 17:56.804
Taylor's going to
try to hold us hostage.

17:56.804 --> 17:59.095
This is why I came back.
Knew you needed the info.

17:59.095 --> 18:00.261
And might have a directive.

18:00.261 --> 18:01.595
Dollar Bill covers them.

18:01.595 --> 18:03.220
My directive:
get him on the phone.

18:08.261 --> 18:09.970
Gonna need you to come in.

18:09.970 --> 18:11.845
And a Happy
Fucking New Year to you.

18:11.845 --> 18:13.553
What do you know about Kling?
And Taylor Mason.

18:13.553 --> 18:15.387
Nothing.
It's New Year's Day.

18:15.387 --> 18:17.637
That's why I said
Happy Fucking New Year...

18:17.637 --> 18:19.637
Knowing nothing's
the fucking problem.

18:19.637 --> 18:22.095
Get your team, get here,
get them in here.

18:22.095 --> 18:23.428
And find out why
Kling is in play...

18:23.428 --> 18:26.178
Which you should have known
in the first place.

18:26.178 --> 18:29.136
Maybe there'll be some
stone crab left over for you.

18:29.136 --> 18:31.220
Not a chance.

18:32.303 --> 18:35.095
Having been on all sides
of these situations,

18:35.095 --> 18:36.470
I feel I have a good instinct

18:36.470 --> 18:38.470
for where the equitable
resolution is.

18:38.470 --> 18:40.970
That's the kind of thing
you say to someone

18:40.970 --> 18:43.220
when you're about to encourage
them to take a deal.

18:43.220 --> 18:46.095
So it is. Yes.
And the deal you should make...

18:46.095 --> 18:48.845
And it's one I believe
will be out there... is:

18:48.845 --> 18:50.762
six month suspension
of your license.

18:50.762 --> 18:52.470
A probationary period.

18:52.470 --> 18:54.887
Say a year.
And then it reverts.

18:54.887 --> 18:56.804
And in another two years,

18:56.804 --> 19:00.011
the record of the entire
proceeding is expunged.

19:00.011 --> 19:03.637
You're recommending
I try for that?

19:03.637 --> 19:04.762
Yeah.

19:04.762 --> 19:07.136
It'll be easier on you.

19:07.136 --> 19:10.011
No, Chuck.
It'll be easier on you.

19:10.011 --> 19:12.220
Because then you can walk out of
here and move onto other things

19:12.220 --> 19:15.679
without guilt or
recrimination from me.

19:15.679 --> 19:18.261
I do need to move on
to the rest of my day...

19:18.261 --> 19:20.178
I've been working on
that thing for months

19:20.178 --> 19:21.387
and it's time sensitive.

19:21.387 --> 19:23.637
But I'm not motivated by that.

19:23.637 --> 19:24.804
Take the deal.

19:24.804 --> 19:28.345
"Take the deal."

19:28.345 --> 19:31.345
Not
"try and make a deal."

19:31.345 --> 19:33.970
Not "perhaps there's
a deal to be made."

19:33.970 --> 19:36.178
Oh, you fucker.

19:36.178 --> 19:38.929
You're not guessing.
Or spitballing.

19:38.929 --> 19:42.178
You're doing what
magicians call a "force."

19:42.178 --> 19:45.095
Letting me think I'm making
a decision you've already made.

19:45.095 --> 19:48.220
You went behind my back
and pre-negotiated a deal.

19:48.220 --> 19:50.053
And now all I have to do
is say "yes."

19:50.053 --> 19:53.136
Well, if Penn & Teller ever need
a guest judge on Fool Us,

19:53.136 --> 19:55.220
you're their man.
You're right.

19:55.220 --> 19:57.220
But that doesn't
make what I did wrong.

19:57.220 --> 19:59.428
It's the smart thing.
Easy thing.

19:59.428 --> 20:01.387
Maybe the right thing.

20:03.679 --> 20:04.845
How's she doing?

20:04.845 --> 20:06.220
Not good, frankly.

20:06.220 --> 20:08.428
She looks guilty,
sounds guilty...

20:08.428 --> 20:10.470
That's 'cause she feels guilty.

20:10.470 --> 20:13.011
Says something good
about her actually.

20:13.011 --> 20:17.887
I mean... most people...

20:17.887 --> 20:20.053
they don't even care.

20:24.679 --> 20:27.428
How can you know me so little
after all this time?

20:27.428 --> 20:29.679
It is publicly admitting guilt.

20:29.679 --> 20:31.011
It is giving up.

20:31.011 --> 20:32.679
And giving in to
what Taylor wants.

20:32.679 --> 20:33.804
And I'd never do any of that.

20:33.804 --> 20:35.762
And I am fucking...

20:37.929 --> 20:40.345
Can I still be hurt by
something you would do?

20:41.929 --> 20:44.387
Well, it seems I can.

20:44.387 --> 20:48.595
Why do you have so little
confidence I can pull this off?

20:50.053 --> 20:52.428
You did, if we're honest here,

20:52.428 --> 20:54.804
use privileged information
to work-over Taylor.

20:54.804 --> 20:58.261
I don't care, morally.

20:58.261 --> 20:59.929
But it means the likelihood is

20:59.929 --> 21:02.720
that you lose in the hearing,
unless you obfuscate.

21:02.720 --> 21:05.595
I've manufactured a way for you
to end up where you want...

21:05.595 --> 21:08.637
With your license, without it
on your permanent record.

21:08.637 --> 21:10.804
And instead of thanking me,
you cast me as

21:10.804 --> 21:13.804
expedient, uncaring,
a disappointment.

21:13.804 --> 21:17.136
I'm offering you a solution.

21:17.136 --> 21:19.512
You'll only accept a miracle.

21:19.512 --> 21:22.637
Now, if you still need me to
stay here and keep going...

21:22.637 --> 21:24.303
No. No.
Go do your 'thing.'

21:24.303 --> 21:25.470
I'll be fine.

21:39.053 --> 21:42.011
Mafee has a matter he would like
to run by the two of us.

21:42.011 --> 21:43.595
In person.

21:43.595 --> 21:45.428
Are you busy?
You seem busy...

21:45.428 --> 21:47.303
Shoot, Mafee.

21:47.303 --> 21:50.428
Well, new year, so I want
to be upfront about something.

21:50.428 --> 21:52.387
We don't have any
specific guidelines,

21:52.387 --> 21:54.637
but with things the way
they are in the world,

21:54.637 --> 21:58.053
would it be okay if I asked
an employee out, socially?

21:58.053 --> 21:59.720
Is it material for us
to know who...

21:59.720 --> 22:01.345
It's Lauren.

22:04.345 --> 22:05.512
Mafee, as long as
you approach them

22:05.512 --> 22:07.261
in a respectful,
consensual manner,

22:07.261 --> 22:09.011
you are free to 'socialize'
with fellow employees

22:09.011 --> 22:10.303
who are not your
direct subordinates.

22:10.303 --> 22:11.595
Including Lauren.

22:11.595 --> 22:12.887
Cool. Thanks.

22:12.887 --> 22:14.470
Not sure I'm gonna.

22:14.470 --> 22:16.136
So if you could not
say anything...

22:16.136 --> 22:17.970
Got it, Mafee.
Don't worry.

22:22.679 --> 22:26.387
Like he said,
new year, new start.

22:26.387 --> 22:28.428
So let's cut the bullshit.

22:28.428 --> 22:30.512
If you and Lauren are trying
to keep your deal secret,

22:30.512 --> 22:32.637
keep it a fucking secret.

22:32.637 --> 22:34.220
So you know...

22:34.220 --> 22:35.595
You think we should tell people?

22:35.595 --> 22:38.887
No. I did not come to work
for a hedge fund manager

22:38.887 --> 22:40.387
who's tagging the IR girls...

22:40.387 --> 22:42.720
That's not the way it is.
At all...

22:42.720 --> 22:44.553
I know that.

22:44.553 --> 22:46.011
But it can be made
to look that way

22:46.011 --> 22:48.387
by people on the outside
who want it to.

22:48.387 --> 22:51.428
So do a better job
of keeping it secret.

22:51.428 --> 22:53.220
Point taken.
Thank you.

23:08.136 --> 23:09.595
Does this guy really work here?

23:09.595 --> 23:11.387
He said he does,
so I brought him up...

23:11.387 --> 23:14.762
I was told to come in,
but I forgot my ID.

23:14.762 --> 23:17.053
Do something useful.

23:18.845 --> 23:20.595
Hey. Hey.

23:20.595 --> 23:23.261
Get that shit out of your maw
and start talking.

23:23.261 --> 23:25.387
You sleeping at the switch
is possibly gonna cost us

23:25.387 --> 23:27.345
hundreds of millions of dollars.

23:27.345 --> 23:29.303
With Taylor effectively
in control of Kling,

23:29.303 --> 23:30.887
they also control the supply

23:30.887 --> 23:32.845
of household appliances
that Saler's sells.

23:32.845 --> 23:35.428
And if Taylor decides to cut
the flow of those appliances?

23:35.428 --> 23:37.929
It'll hurt them,
but it'll gut you.

23:37.929 --> 23:40.303
Sales of Kling appliances
account for

23:40.303 --> 23:42.720
sixty-three percent
of Saler's revenue.

23:42.720 --> 23:45.261
Yeah. That would...
That would crush our business.

23:45.261 --> 23:47.428
And if Taylor gets
outside backing,

23:47.428 --> 23:49.345
there's danger of
a reverse merger.

23:49.345 --> 23:51.178
They could use Kling
to take over Saler's.

23:51.178 --> 23:52.762
Yeah.
God. That little asshole...

23:52.762 --> 23:56.595
Look. I put you on their radar,
it's on me to fix this.

23:56.595 --> 23:58.303
We need to get a new
appliance supplier.

23:58.303 --> 23:59.929
So we're totally independent.

23:59.929 --> 24:02.637
I'll lead the way with the
board, since this is my fault.

24:02.637 --> 24:06.387
Bosch, LG, Haier, Samsung...

24:06.387 --> 24:07.428
I need to figure out
who's for sale

24:07.428 --> 24:09.970
or ripe for a hostile takeover.

24:11.595 --> 24:13.595
Boss, I don't need
to tell you that

24:13.595 --> 24:15.762
every one of those companies
will cost billions.

24:15.762 --> 24:17.637
And Saler's has more debt
than cash right now.

24:17.637 --> 24:19.387
Yeah. I am aware.

24:19.387 --> 24:21.887
You're more than welcome to find
me the cheaper fucking option.

24:29.387 --> 24:32.011
Do you recognize that?

24:32.011 --> 24:33.679
I do not.

24:33.679 --> 24:36.345
Victor, are you aware what
happened last year at Art Basel?

24:36.345 --> 24:38.136
You went off, bought like
twenty paintings, right?

24:38.136 --> 24:39.804
Eighteen.

24:39.804 --> 24:42.178
The sales and usage tax
that I'm facing

24:42.178 --> 24:43.553
is around seventy-five mil.

24:43.553 --> 24:45.512
Fuck me.
Yeah.

24:45.512 --> 24:48.261
Instead my friend
Sean Ayles here

24:48.261 --> 24:50.220
intro'd me to
a very nice Swiss banker

24:50.220 --> 24:52.261
who said he was willing
to store them for me...

24:52.261 --> 24:55.178
Because while they have started
reporting cash holdings

24:55.178 --> 24:56.595
to the US government,

24:56.595 --> 24:59.303
Swiss banks didn't
have to report art.

24:59.303 --> 25:01.470
Nice... Until now.

25:01.470 --> 25:03.679
The bank decided
to knuckle under

25:03.679 --> 25:05.637
and share the news
with Uncle Sam.

25:05.637 --> 25:07.053
Oh my...

25:07.053 --> 25:10.095
So he did me the good service
of shipping 'em here.

25:10.095 --> 25:11.804
But if I take it...

25:11.804 --> 25:14.011
It costs you
seventy-five balloons.

25:14.011 --> 25:15.303
Oh my...

25:15.303 --> 25:16.512
Happy fucking New Year.

25:16.512 --> 25:18.053
Why's everybody keep
saying that?

25:18.053 --> 25:21.345
Sean, you have
anything to offer?

25:21.345 --> 25:22.720
No excuses, sir.

25:22.720 --> 25:25.136
Any advance word from
your Swiss banker friend?

25:25.136 --> 25:26.303
No excuses, sir.

25:26.303 --> 25:28.011
Any fucking suggestions?

25:28.011 --> 25:30.387
No excuses, sir...

25:30.387 --> 25:32.970
You're not a wartime
consigliere, Sean.

25:32.970 --> 25:36.345
I need you to find me
a workaround.

25:36.345 --> 25:37.387
On it.

25:45.887 --> 25:47.220
Isn't my assistant out there...

25:47.220 --> 25:50.929
Do you think that,
uh, Grasshopper

25:50.929 --> 25:53.220
left Master Po waiting
in the dojo?

25:53.220 --> 25:54.845
I mean, it's not
a fair comparison.

25:54.845 --> 25:56.762
Grasshopper was living there,
and was kind of a servant,

25:56.762 --> 25:58.595
so he didn't have
much of a choice.

25:58.595 --> 26:01.095
Yeah, well, you don't have much
of a choice either there, Champ.

26:01.095 --> 26:05.095
Not if you want to get the stink
of Eau De Loser off of you.

26:05.095 --> 26:07.720
But I didn't no-show you.
I sent an email.

26:07.720 --> 26:09.762
Our first session was...
It's already paying dividends.

26:09.762 --> 26:11.345
I'm cooking here.
You saw when you came in...

26:11.345 --> 26:12.637
I wasn't sitting behind my desk.

26:12.637 --> 26:14.553
"Battle stance at all times.
Ready for action."

26:14.553 --> 26:17.095
It is a no-show even if
you email. Or call.

26:17.095 --> 26:19.679
Or send me a goddamned bugler
to sound it to me.

26:19.679 --> 26:21.595
I am not offended.

26:21.595 --> 26:24.095
I am alert to the signs
that you are sending,

26:24.095 --> 26:27.178
buddy boy, of a blockage.

26:28.887 --> 26:31.345
I can see that.
But this was...

26:31.345 --> 26:33.178
Something big
is happening today.

26:33.178 --> 26:34.595
Something that made it
impossible.

26:34.595 --> 26:37.011
Are you dead?

26:37.011 --> 26:38.637
You ask that literally?

26:38.637 --> 26:42.428
Yeah. I do.
Are. You. Dead? Mort.

26:42.428 --> 26:44.053
Because then,
maybe it would have been

26:44.053 --> 26:45.553
impossible for you to show up.

26:45.553 --> 26:47.929
There is always a story
to tell yourself.

26:47.929 --> 26:50.970
You say that word impossible
to me again one more time,

26:50.970 --> 26:52.929
and I will kick it out of your
mouth along with your teeth.

26:52.929 --> 26:56.095
Now, you finish your
all-important task here.

26:56.095 --> 26:59.303
And then you find me tonight.

26:59.303 --> 27:01.970
Or never find me again.

27:14.470 --> 27:15.970
Yo, sassy stems...

27:15.970 --> 27:19.303
Not here, never here with
that pet name bullshit.

27:19.303 --> 27:21.512
Not that it'll matter
soon enough.

27:21.512 --> 27:23.178
Why's that?

27:23.178 --> 27:26.929
Axe is sending me on the road
to rustle up new outside money.

27:26.929 --> 27:29.261
Since we don't have
an IR person right now.

27:29.261 --> 27:31.095
I'm the IR person.

27:31.095 --> 27:32.303
That's bullshit.

27:32.303 --> 27:33.679
It's fun as fuck.

27:33.679 --> 27:35.011
See you when I'm off the road.

27:36.970 --> 27:39.178
Hey.

27:39.178 --> 27:42.095
I wanted to wish you good luck
at the hearing.

27:42.095 --> 27:43.470
Go kill it.

27:43.470 --> 27:44.512
You go kill it.

27:44.512 --> 27:46.136
Nature is metal.

27:46.136 --> 27:47.679
And I'm nature.

27:47.679 --> 27:49.595
Will do.

28:00.303 --> 28:01.887
Your bug is in place.

28:01.887 --> 28:04.095
Great fucking news!

28:04.095 --> 28:05.845
What's the time frame
on Chuck's house.

28:05.845 --> 28:08.512
Well, Chuck and the missus
were also both out...

28:08.512 --> 28:10.387
And their kids out
with Grandpa Senior.

28:10.387 --> 28:12.553
So the house was empty.
We got up on both.

28:12.553 --> 28:16.595
You are the man!

28:16.595 --> 28:18.303
Expect a bottle in your
Christmas stocking on me.

28:18.303 --> 28:19.762
Top shelf.
Sure thing.

28:19.762 --> 28:21.053
Happy it worked out.
Yeah.

28:21.053 --> 28:22.762
One thing though:
chalk a big ring

28:22.762 --> 28:24.595
around the listening room
and taint team office.

28:24.595 --> 28:26.470
You cross that line,
Judge'll burn your case.

28:26.470 --> 28:28.553
And you with it.
You know I will.

28:34.887 --> 28:39.053
No one makes me smile
like my boy!

28:39.053 --> 28:41.553
What about that
sweet little baby girl

28:41.553 --> 28:43.261
with the champion's chin?

28:43.261 --> 28:45.595
She fills the chest with
happiness, too, of course.

28:45.595 --> 28:47.679
In a much less complicated way.

28:47.679 --> 28:50.053
She never has to perform.
Never has to achieve.

28:50.053 --> 28:52.053
Mm.
As long as she merely is,

28:52.053 --> 28:53.637
she brings joy.

28:53.637 --> 28:57.762
But you, son, bring pride
along for the journey.

28:57.762 --> 28:59.720
What the fuck kind of meds
are you on?

28:59.720 --> 29:02.261
Pure adrenaline. I've been out
walking the city today.

29:02.261 --> 29:03.428
Ah-ha.

29:03.428 --> 29:05.095
Youbetcha.

29:05.095 --> 29:07.720
Thinking of all the things
that we're going to do.

29:07.720 --> 29:10.679
And it freshens the blood
like Geritol.

29:10.679 --> 29:12.136
Uh-huh.
And, uh, Mom?

29:12.136 --> 29:13.428
She's down in Palm Beach

29:13.428 --> 29:15.261
enjoying the weather
and the shopping.

29:15.261 --> 29:16.261
Good for her.

29:16.261 --> 29:18.261
And speaking of joy.

29:18.261 --> 29:20.762
I saw your kids today.

29:20.762 --> 29:23.136
A delight!

29:23.136 --> 29:24.762
Real gentleman and lady.

29:24.762 --> 29:26.595
Well, they love
their grandfather.

29:26.595 --> 29:28.387
Cup of tea?

29:28.387 --> 29:30.470
Mm.

29:30.470 --> 29:32.345
Ira and... The Secretary?

29:32.345 --> 29:33.970
En route.

29:33.970 --> 29:35.470
Shouldn't be long.

29:44.762 --> 29:46.970
What the fuck is he doing here?

29:46.970 --> 29:49.303
Ah.
We like him again.

29:49.303 --> 29:50.804
Special project.

29:50.804 --> 29:53.679
We're good...

30:07.970 --> 30:11.178
The Italians think anyone
who puts milk on their coffee

30:11.178 --> 30:13.595
after 11AM is animale.

30:13.595 --> 30:15.887
I tend to agree.
In theory, but in reality...

30:15.887 --> 30:17.679
Just gimme the espresso.

30:17.679 --> 30:19.553
There's a guy from
the shipping company here.

30:19.553 --> 30:21.679
Another guy.
Kind of demanding to see you.

30:31.970 --> 30:33.637
I can't afford
to have my only guys

30:33.637 --> 30:35.845
working the holiday
pulled out of service.

30:35.845 --> 30:38.053
You told him I spritzed you?

30:39.261 --> 30:40.720
He tells me everything.

30:40.720 --> 30:43.595
And I tell my brother-in-law
everything.

30:43.595 --> 30:45.011
Don't you want to know

30:45.011 --> 30:46.679
what my brother-in-law
does for a living?

30:46.679 --> 30:47.762
Do I?

30:47.762 --> 30:49.387
He works in a little
outfit called

30:49.387 --> 30:51.970
United States Customs
and Border Protection.

30:51.970 --> 30:54.387
Well, isn't that a sweet set-up.

30:54.387 --> 30:56.095
It really is.

30:56.095 --> 30:58.053
Ayles!

31:00.303 --> 31:03.220
Will you take this gentleman
somewhere to talk in private.

31:03.220 --> 31:05.220
Make sure he's not recording it.

31:05.220 --> 31:07.303
And then make him happy.

31:07.303 --> 31:10.553
I am grateful
of the opportunity to,

31:10.553 --> 31:13.053
as they say at the rummy table,
get off the schneid.

31:13.053 --> 31:15.512
Sir?

31:15.512 --> 31:18.428
If any other guys like you
show up to shake me down,

31:18.428 --> 31:19.762
I start burning paintings.

31:19.762 --> 31:20.970
I'd rather lose money
than deal with

31:20.970 --> 31:23.553
this bullshit another minute.

31:29.512 --> 31:30.762
HNY.

31:30.762 --> 31:32.095
Why are we here?

31:32.095 --> 31:34.178
Well. I didn't think
you'd want all of them...

31:34.178 --> 31:36.053
Getting a jump-start
on the year ahead of you.

31:36.053 --> 31:37.595
But why are they here?

31:37.595 --> 31:40.720
They don't want me getting
a jump-start on them.

31:59.762 --> 32:01.887
Why'd you really come back?

32:01.887 --> 32:04.887
How many margaritas and
piña coladas can a man drink?

32:04.887 --> 32:07.261
When it's the man I'm looking
at, a hell of a lot.

32:07.261 --> 32:09.929
And how long can you stay in
the sun before getting burned?

32:12.804 --> 32:14.804
What time is it?

32:14.804 --> 32:18.303
Yes.
The Patek is gone.

32:18.303 --> 32:19.929
Your dad gave that to you,
didn't he?

32:19.929 --> 32:21.762
Bequeathed it
ahead of his death.

32:21.762 --> 32:24.387
Quite a dry-eyed moment
for him...

32:24.387 --> 32:27.261
Estate planning and so forth...

32:27.261 --> 32:31.387
But for me,
it meant a great deal.

32:31.387 --> 32:32.804
A great deal.

32:32.804 --> 32:35.762
Where is it?

32:35.762 --> 32:37.136
Somewhere in South Beach.

32:37.136 --> 32:39.428
Or maybe already riding
the Silk Road

32:39.428 --> 32:41.929
to some exotic destination.

32:41.929 --> 32:43.470
You didn't get so drunk
you sold it.

32:43.470 --> 32:45.303
Nope.

32:45.303 --> 32:47.261
Went back to the hotel room
with a young lady I had met.

32:47.261 --> 32:49.345
A yacht girl.
But not really.

32:49.345 --> 32:51.136
She was...

32:51.136 --> 32:52.762
I thought she was special.

32:52.762 --> 32:54.178
How young?

32:54.178 --> 32:55.762
Does it matter?

32:55.762 --> 32:58.595
She had an old soul...

32:58.595 --> 33:00.136
22.

33:01.762 --> 33:03.345
I thought I liked her.

33:05.679 --> 33:07.178
I did like her.

33:07.178 --> 33:09.178
And then?

33:09.178 --> 33:12.178
Passed out. Woke up,
she, and the watch, were gone.

33:12.178 --> 33:14.553
You call the police?

33:14.553 --> 33:17.512
Too embarrassed.

33:17.512 --> 33:19.387
Too sad.

33:19.387 --> 33:22.178
Put a real dent in
my faith in humanity.

33:22.178 --> 33:24.178
It's sweet you still have some.

33:28.679 --> 33:30.345
Lemme make a call.

33:30.345 --> 33:31.428
It'll make you feel better.

33:31.428 --> 33:33.011
Watch dealer?

33:33.011 --> 33:35.220
Close.
She's a specialist.

33:35.220 --> 33:36.387
In what?

33:36.387 --> 33:38.053
Restoring faith in humanity.

33:44.387 --> 33:46.261
Let's dispense with
the pleasantries

33:46.261 --> 33:48.053
and ball tickling, shall we.

33:48.053 --> 33:50.470
What's this about a problem?

33:50.470 --> 33:53.136
Political winds shift,
I have to shift with them.

33:53.136 --> 33:55.345
And the Middle East is
the windiest of them all.

33:55.345 --> 33:57.095
Qatar is persona non grata
again.

33:57.095 --> 33:59.762
That may be. But your tit's
in the wringer...

33:59.762 --> 34:01.136
My son put it there...

34:01.136 --> 34:02.637
So you'd better not
shift too much

34:02.637 --> 34:05.053
or it'll get ripped off.
He'll tear it off.

34:05.053 --> 34:08.219
What he's saying in
his inimitable way is:

34:08.219 --> 34:12.804
what can we do to keep
the financing in place?

34:12.804 --> 34:16.303
Okay. Crap.
Okay.

34:16.303 --> 34:17.887
Perhaps I can paper an exception

34:17.887 --> 34:19.844
and bury it deep in
the halls of government.

34:19.844 --> 34:21.428
But for that,
we have to go beyond

34:21.428 --> 34:23.512
the parameters of
the original deal.

34:23.512 --> 34:26.053
I'm not gonna stay neutral,
I need to go positive.

34:26.053 --> 34:28.094
- Hold on...
- What are you saying?

34:28.094 --> 34:30.094
If the loan I help facilitate

34:30.094 --> 34:32.844
results in your development,
I want to...

34:35.594 --> 34:37.679
From my bowl?

34:37.679 --> 34:38.804
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh my god...

34:38.804 --> 34:40.679
Quiet, Ira.
How much?

34:43.261 --> 34:45.094
Fucking shakedown.

34:45.094 --> 34:47.178
In line with standard
finder's fees.

34:47.178 --> 34:48.428
He's right.

34:48.428 --> 34:50.512
Maybe he is.
But I don't have to like it.

34:50.512 --> 34:54.011
Whatever our understanding,
it can't just be verbal...

34:54.011 --> 34:58.136
Ah.
I've taken the liberty.

34:58.136 --> 35:00.136
For our comfort...

35:00.136 --> 35:02.595
All we need to do is...

35:02.595 --> 35:06.804
And then everyone is nice.

35:24.804 --> 35:26.303
Perhaps you'd like
to take these...

35:26.303 --> 35:28.053
I'm not touching
that fucking thing.

35:28.053 --> 35:30.178
Suit yourself.
I'll just put them in my safe.

35:30.178 --> 35:32.512
One second, fast guy.

35:46.303 --> 35:48.428
There'll be no changing it
after the fact now.

35:48.428 --> 35:50.970
I need to go back to DC.

35:50.970 --> 35:53.053
I have work to do.

35:53.053 --> 35:55.345
Gentlemen.

36:02.595 --> 36:04.679
Now that it's just
the three of us, I have to say,

36:04.679 --> 36:07.011
I did not know the nature of
that conversation beforehand...

36:07.011 --> 36:08.470
And further...

36:08.470 --> 36:10.512
You can do all the mewling
you want about matters legal

36:10.512 --> 36:12.345
once I get this copy
locked in my safe.

36:12.345 --> 36:15.011
And then, Dad.
You have to tell him everything.

36:15.011 --> 36:17.595
So he can defend us,
whatever may come.

36:17.595 --> 36:20.053
You mean about the idiot
who stands to lose the most?

36:20.053 --> 36:22.011
Can I really... Yes.

36:22.011 --> 36:23.303
I can't listen to future plans.

36:23.303 --> 36:24.845
But the things
you've already done.

36:24.845 --> 36:26.887
And the people with whom
you've done 'em,

36:26.887 --> 36:27.804
that I need to know.

36:38.553 --> 36:41.637
I've taken the liberty.

36:41.637 --> 36:42.929
For our comfort...

36:42.929 --> 36:44.970
All we need to do is...

36:44.970 --> 36:47.011
This is fucking incredible.

36:47.011 --> 36:48.345
What... What am I hearing...

36:48.345 --> 36:49.929
That they've entered
into a conspiracy?

36:49.929 --> 36:52.136
Fraud.
A quid pro quo deal.

36:52.136 --> 36:53.428
International banking
violations.

36:53.428 --> 36:55.011
Money laundering to follow.
Shh...

36:55.011 --> 36:56.136
What's that rustling?

36:56.136 --> 36:57.887
Did they paper
this fucking deal?

36:57.887 --> 36:59.387
Perhaps you'd like
to hold these...

36:59.387 --> 37:01.470
I'm not touching
that fucking thing.

37:01.470 --> 37:02.637
Suit yourself.
I'll just put them in my safe.

37:02.637 --> 37:04.553
Stay tuned for this next part.

37:04.553 --> 37:06.136
Now that it's just
the three of us, I have to say,

37:06.136 --> 37:07.762
I did not know
the nature of that conversation

37:07.762 --> 37:09.345
beforehand...
And further...

37:09.345 --> 37:10.970
You can do all
the mewling you want

37:10.970 --> 37:12.887
about matters legal once I get
this copy locked in my safe.

37:12.887 --> 37:14.261
And then, Dad.

37:14.261 --> 37:16.136
You have to tell him everything.

37:16.136 --> 37:18.053
So he can defend us,
whatever may come.

37:18.053 --> 37:19.595
You mean about the idiot

37:19.595 --> 37:21.095
who stands to lose the most?

37:21.095 --> 37:22.887
Can I really...

37:22.887 --> 37:25.220
What the hell?

37:25.220 --> 37:26.845
We were just getting
to the good part...

37:26.845 --> 37:27.929
You know what the hell.

37:29.553 --> 37:31.720
There's no attorney-client
privilege with Krakow there.

37:31.720 --> 37:33.428
After Krakow leaves,

37:33.428 --> 37:35.387
Ira Schirmer clearly states
that he is their lawyer...

37:35.387 --> 37:37.637
In an exculpatory way for him,
I might add...

37:37.637 --> 37:39.345
And is about to give
legal advice.

37:39.345 --> 37:41.220
And so it was headphones off
for the agent

37:41.220 --> 37:42.261
and they killed the recording.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.261
So that... that was it,

37:45.261 --> 37:48.595
that was all he got
before he had to minimize?

37:48.595 --> 37:49.804
Roughly all.

37:49.804 --> 37:51.303
Fuck roughly.
What else did he get,

37:51.303 --> 37:52.595
what else is on
the unredacted tape?

37:52.595 --> 37:54.387
What, exactly, was getting
locked in the safe?

37:54.387 --> 37:56.178
Bryan! We talked about
this very fucking thing...

37:56.178 --> 37:58.428
Ohh. Come on, Kate.
This isn't fucking Girl Scouts.

37:58.428 --> 38:00.470
They were dancing around
whatever they were doing...

38:00.470 --> 38:02.053
If there's documentation
to be retrieved,

38:02.053 --> 38:03.470
the audio will get me a warrant.

38:03.470 --> 38:05.470
Stop pushing me.

38:05.470 --> 38:08.387
And you shouldn't even be
asking those questions.

38:08.387 --> 38:10.970
This is exactly
what I was afraid of.

38:15.970 --> 38:17.637
This meeting is over.

38:24.762 --> 38:27.345
Danny Margolis.

38:27.345 --> 38:30.804
You have done some good for me
in the not too distant past.

38:30.804 --> 38:32.178
And from what I hear,

38:32.178 --> 38:34.178
you made quite an impression
on those Feds.

38:34.178 --> 38:37.095
For the record it was chilly
that day by the pool.

38:37.095 --> 38:39.345
As I recall
it was positively balmy.

38:39.345 --> 38:41.136
But whatever you need
to tell yourself.

38:41.136 --> 38:43.512
Anyway, it motivated me
to tighten up my game.

38:43.512 --> 38:45.261
I'm working out like
six days a week now...

38:45.261 --> 38:46.970
Good for you.
Yeah.

38:46.970 --> 38:49.637
So. Business at hand.

38:49.637 --> 38:51.553
I believe I can do you
some more good, Axe.

38:51.553 --> 38:53.095
Let me tell you
what a freeport is...

38:53.095 --> 38:54.929
A storage facility
at a private airport

38:54.929 --> 38:57.136
where valuables purchased
overseas can be stored

38:57.136 --> 38:59.345
and deemed perpetually
'in transit' so the customs,

38:59.345 --> 39:01.845
duties and sales tax
can be avoided.

39:03.303 --> 39:05.136
So you do know...
Of course he does.

39:05.136 --> 39:07.136
But tell him the good part.

39:07.136 --> 39:09.512
I have one that I bought into.

39:09.512 --> 39:12.053
A freeport. Up in Newburgh,
private airstrip.

39:12.053 --> 39:13.637
Is that right?
Yeah.

39:13.637 --> 39:15.512
And I'm the commandant.

39:15.512 --> 39:17.845
So I can house your paintings
in a permanent tax-free state.

39:17.845 --> 39:19.679
That is of value.

39:19.679 --> 39:21.512
And I can do you
one even better:

39:21.512 --> 39:24.553
I'll store replicas,
so you can hang the originals.

39:24.553 --> 39:26.553
If anyone asks, you say
they're the replicas.

39:26.553 --> 39:28.887
For a small fee, of course.

39:28.887 --> 39:31.428
Medium fee?

39:31.428 --> 39:32.387
Okay.

39:32.387 --> 39:34.053
Stop talking.

39:34.053 --> 39:36.345
The rest gets worked out
between you and Victor.

39:36.345 --> 39:39.345
The shipment from Europe
will be rerouted to you.

39:39.345 --> 39:41.136
You let me know when I can
expect the 'replicas.'

39:48.345 --> 39:50.595
Hey.
You did well here.

39:50.595 --> 39:52.970
Keep it up.
Impress me.

39:52.970 --> 39:55.261
And soon enough you'll get off
the austerity plan.

39:55.261 --> 39:56.762
You can count on it.

40:06.303 --> 40:09.178
Now, that puts a bounce
in my man's step.

40:12.595 --> 40:15.428
Though I'm not sure I'd use
that room for that.

40:15.428 --> 40:16.845
Hard floor.

40:16.845 --> 40:19.053
Too hard.
And very public...

40:19.053 --> 40:20.595
She's not what you think she is.

40:32.845 --> 40:35.303
You need to know
that you might cry.

40:35.303 --> 40:39.095
And if you do,
that's just release.

40:39.095 --> 40:42.637
It means connection.

40:42.637 --> 40:46.136
It means freedom from
having to hold it all in.

40:46.136 --> 40:48.136
That sounds so good.

40:48.136 --> 40:49.970
How do we...

41:11.428 --> 41:13.679
She's a professional cuddler.

41:14.887 --> 41:16.553
And a star in her field.

41:37.220 --> 41:39.595
So...

41:39.595 --> 41:40.720
Hmm?

41:40.720 --> 41:42.804
Oh.
This our own cuddle session?

41:42.804 --> 41:45.553
No.
You already did the thing.

41:45.553 --> 41:48.845
Made me feel warm
and loved and cared for.

41:48.845 --> 41:51.845
Oh. Well, that's something
I don't hear every day.

41:51.845 --> 41:54.387
Look. I don't know if
Gordie really scraped his knee

41:54.387 --> 41:56.136
and Dean broke his surfboard...

41:56.136 --> 41:59.178
But you came back for me.

41:59.178 --> 42:02.387
As you would... and have... for me.

42:02.387 --> 42:04.637
It's more than touching, Axe.

42:04.637 --> 42:09.303
It's... compared to what I have
at this moment at home

42:09.303 --> 42:11.637
it's, uh... really nice.

42:11.637 --> 42:15.553
But also: you needed
to come back for you.

42:15.553 --> 42:18.512
For this...

42:18.512 --> 42:20.136
What about it?
They all fucked up.

42:20.136 --> 42:21.929
They needed to come in
and fix it.

42:21.929 --> 42:23.679
No. If it wasn't
today's reasons,

42:23.679 --> 42:25.387
you'd have come up with others.

42:25.387 --> 42:27.303
Okay.
I suppose I might've.

42:27.303 --> 42:29.053
You need to let them go home.

42:29.053 --> 42:31.595
Every single one of them.

42:31.595 --> 42:33.512
I don't like it.
If I'm here grinding,

42:33.512 --> 42:35.011
they should be here
grinding too.

42:35.011 --> 42:36.720
Yeah. You can't let yourself
take a day off,

42:36.720 --> 42:38.011
so they can't take a day off.

42:38.011 --> 42:39.929
So you can surround yourself.

42:39.929 --> 42:44.470
Okay. Maybe I want
the edge they'll get me.

42:44.470 --> 42:46.428
Maybe I want them to
regain their own edge.

42:46.428 --> 42:47.679
Maybe I want them
to feel the opposite

42:47.679 --> 42:50.303
of the way Wags does right now...

42:50.303 --> 42:52.929
Totally uncomfortable in
their position and place,

42:52.929 --> 42:55.720
scared to death of
my disapproval, of failing,

42:55.720 --> 42:57.470
of not being exactly
where I need them to be

42:57.470 --> 42:59.053
exactly when I need them there.

42:59.053 --> 43:00.720
Many of them thrive
under those conditions.

43:00.720 --> 43:03.428
For long bursts.
But then they need to recover.

43:03.428 --> 43:04.720
On my time?

43:04.720 --> 43:06.762
It's not all your time.
It's a holiday.

43:06.762 --> 43:09.595
There are no holidays
when it's my money.

43:09.595 --> 43:10.929
They are rich because of me.

43:10.929 --> 43:12.845
So they can help me
stay that way.

43:12.845 --> 43:15.595
You're punishing them
because they're not you.

43:15.595 --> 43:18.303
You need to let them
go home, Bobby.

43:18.303 --> 43:20.804
So they can come back tomorrow
and actually work.

43:20.804 --> 43:22.804
What's the point of
any of you being rich

43:22.804 --> 43:24.387
if you can't fucking enjoy it.

43:24.387 --> 43:26.804
I'll let you know when I do...

43:30.970 --> 43:33.679
This...

43:33.679 --> 43:35.136
Yeah.

43:35.136 --> 43:39.387
This is why I can't let you
lose that hearing.

43:39.387 --> 43:42.136
Because I have always known

43:42.136 --> 43:45.470
I need you more than
anyone else here.

43:45.470 --> 43:47.637
At least I have since...

43:47.637 --> 43:50.178
Have I ever told you

43:50.178 --> 43:53.804
why and when, exactly,

43:53.804 --> 43:57.637
I knew that you were gonna be
my partner at all this. Forever.

43:57.637 --> 43:59.095
You remember?

43:59.095 --> 44:01.929
What kind of man would I be
if I didn't?

44:01.929 --> 44:04.929
Mnh.

44:08.178 --> 44:10.011
Well, this was
the one time in my life

44:10.011 --> 44:13.220
I wasn't able to fight for
myself, and you fought for me.

44:13.220 --> 44:15.178
Well. I'm sure you didn't
let on that was the case.

44:15.178 --> 44:16.970
Whenever this was.

44:16.970 --> 44:19.595
Yeah. But you knew.

44:19.595 --> 44:22.720
It was right after 9/11.

44:22.720 --> 44:25.762
When I'd made the bold
but foolhardy statement

44:25.762 --> 44:27.970
that I would take care of
all the survivors,

44:27.970 --> 44:31.011
and the families
of those who didn't.

44:31.011 --> 44:34.804
And that I'd not only find a way
to pay for every funeral,

44:34.804 --> 44:37.011
put every kid through school,

44:37.011 --> 44:40.053
but that I'd also pay out
all the bonuses too,

44:40.053 --> 44:41.428
for the next three years.

44:41.428 --> 44:43.512
It wasn't foolhardy.
It was generous.

44:43.512 --> 44:45.220
It was the best of you.

44:45.220 --> 44:47.637
Sure.
But also: impossible.

44:47.637 --> 44:51.428
Every business advisor I had

44:51.428 --> 44:53.470
told me to
shut down the company.

44:53.470 --> 44:56.720
Act of God.
Nothing for me to do.

44:56.720 --> 44:58.845
I mean, we had no book,
we had no personnel.

44:58.845 --> 45:00.345
We were facing margin calls.

45:00.345 --> 45:02.220
Every bank insisted
I let it die.

45:02.220 --> 45:03.845
But you didn't listen.

45:03.845 --> 45:05.512
You'd been awake for, what,
three weeks straight?

45:05.512 --> 45:06.887
Mm.

45:06.887 --> 45:08.470
I remember wondering
how you were doing it.

45:08.470 --> 45:11.011
How you stayed so lucid.

45:11.011 --> 45:12.804
I didn't feel it.

45:12.804 --> 45:16.261
You still don't know
the moment, do you?

45:16.261 --> 45:18.887
I... don't.

45:18.887 --> 45:20.136
It's all such a...

45:20.136 --> 45:22.220
Yeah. It was a blur.

45:22.220 --> 45:24.679
Except for the few
that stand out.

45:24.679 --> 45:26.762
This was at one of the funerals.

45:26.762 --> 45:29.679
God. For a while that was
our days, right?

45:29.679 --> 45:31.970
Going down to Ground Zero
in the morning,

45:31.970 --> 45:33.428
funeral in the afternoon,

45:33.428 --> 45:36.804
then arguing with banks
and investors, you know,

45:36.804 --> 45:41.178
every hour into the night,
to try to save the company.

45:41.178 --> 45:42.720
I mean, look.

45:42.720 --> 45:44.261
I knew that I'd locked in
a windfall.

45:44.261 --> 45:46.011
But it hadn't been
repatriated yet.

45:46.011 --> 45:48.553
Back then, I was still
just on loan to you guys

45:48.553 --> 45:50.428
from that sports psych place
I worked at.

45:50.428 --> 45:52.720
Yeah. We used to do
the funerals together.

45:52.720 --> 45:54.553
You would help
with the families.

45:54.553 --> 45:56.679
And then at this one funeral,

45:56.679 --> 46:00.679
I got bum rushed by
this group of families.

46:00.679 --> 46:03.428
Who told me I wasn't getting
them all paid fast enough.

46:03.428 --> 46:06.011
They attacked my integrity.
They called me a thief.

46:06.011 --> 46:07.512
Said I was stealing money
from them.

46:07.512 --> 46:09.136
When all I was fucking doing

46:09.136 --> 46:13.053
was arguing and scheming

46:13.053 --> 46:17.637
just to keep the firm going
to give them their money.

46:17.637 --> 46:20.220
Normally, I'd have...
I'd have fought it.

46:20.220 --> 46:24.428
But

46:24.428 --> 46:28.387
right at that moment,

46:28.387 --> 46:30.595
it all just became too much.

46:30.595 --> 46:32.220
Of course.

46:32.220 --> 46:35.428
The grief, the sleeplessness,
the survivor's guilt,

46:35.428 --> 46:38.178
the impossibility of the task...

46:38.178 --> 46:41.220
I just stood there,
as they unloaded on me.

46:41.220 --> 46:43.512
I was struck dumb.

46:43.512 --> 46:45.762
And then the whole place
started watching.

46:45.762 --> 46:48.512
It almost turned into
a mob situation.

46:48.512 --> 46:49.762
And that is when...

46:49.762 --> 46:52.345
I stepped in between
them and you.

46:54.136 --> 46:55.345
I remember now.

46:55.345 --> 46:56.387
You sure did.

46:56.387 --> 46:57.804
You remember what you said?

46:57.804 --> 46:59.637
'Cause I remember every word.

46:59.637 --> 47:01.845
Loud enough for the whole place
to hear:

47:01.845 --> 47:05.345
"Shut the fuck up.

47:05.345 --> 47:08.345
You lost family.
So did everyone else here.

47:08.345 --> 47:10.929
And this man is the only hope
you... or any of you...

47:10.929 --> 47:13.095
Have of paying for
the rest of your lives.

47:13.095 --> 47:16.679
And I'll tell you another thing,
I have begged him not to.

47:16.679 --> 47:20.178
Because I think
it'll destroy him next.

47:20.178 --> 47:21.553
He doesn't need it.

47:21.553 --> 47:24.887
He can move on clean
and in a couple of years

47:24.887 --> 47:27.220
he'll have enough wealth
for twenty lifetimes.

47:27.220 --> 47:29.387
But if he's really
too slow for you,

47:29.387 --> 47:31.428
if you really think that
he is stealing from you,

47:31.428 --> 47:34.679
say another word, and I will
make him shut it down.

47:34.679 --> 47:38.053
Otherwise,
shake his fucking hand,

47:38.053 --> 47:41.428
say thank you,
and we can all mourn together."

47:41.428 --> 47:43.387
And that's just what happened...

47:44.887 --> 47:46.762
But that's not the moment.

47:46.762 --> 47:48.720
The moment is when
you got to my car after.

47:48.720 --> 47:49.762
And you said...

47:49.762 --> 47:52.053
I said, "Bobby,

47:52.053 --> 47:54.845
you better fucking deliver
for those people.

47:54.845 --> 47:56.428
Or I won't just make you quit.

47:56.428 --> 47:57.679
I'll kill you myself."

47:57.679 --> 48:00.053
And right then

48:00.053 --> 48:02.804
I knew that you were my partner
in this for life.

48:02.804 --> 48:07.387
Because you were loyal to me
in the face of the world,

48:07.387 --> 48:09.387
but in private
you held me to account

48:09.387 --> 48:11.762
and you were loyal
to the bigger cause.

48:11.762 --> 48:13.178
And you were fun as hell
to watch.

48:13.178 --> 48:14.595
And you still are.

48:14.595 --> 48:17.929
So you say whatever you need
in that hearing

48:17.929 --> 48:19.428
to get you out of this.

48:19.428 --> 48:22.845
And I will back you to
the ends of the earth on it.

48:30.011 --> 48:31.553
I hope I can.

48:34.261 --> 48:37.804
And if you can't,
you got to do the other thing.

48:37.804 --> 48:39.929
The other thing?

48:39.929 --> 48:42.178
You have the power
to make this go away.

48:42.178 --> 48:45.053
So that you don't have to
defend yourself in that hearing.

48:45.053 --> 48:48.136
I heard you earlier,
that Taylor can't be moved.

48:48.136 --> 48:51.679
And if it was me trying,
then you'd probably be right...

48:51.679 --> 48:56.303
But as much as it kills me
to suggest:

48:56.303 --> 48:57.512
Go to Taylor.

48:57.512 --> 48:59.095
Talk to them.

48:59.095 --> 49:02.887
And ask for their forgiveness.

49:11.095 --> 49:14.512
Right.

49:22.387 --> 49:23.804
Oh. You look zenned out.

49:23.804 --> 49:25.470
Enjoy your hug?

49:25.470 --> 49:27.512
Oh, she gives
far more than that.

49:27.512 --> 49:30.470
She imparts a total sense
of well-being.

49:32.387 --> 49:34.595
Ah. Ben Kim!
Lookit that.

49:34.595 --> 49:36.762
The only one to
come in voluntarily.

49:36.762 --> 49:38.970
I do this every year.

49:38.970 --> 49:41.804
I sit at my desk,
alone, visualize

49:41.804 --> 49:43.345
and do my goal setting
for the year.

49:43.345 --> 49:44.887
Of course you do.

49:44.887 --> 49:49.428
Ben, my boy, you're not
doing it alone this year.

49:49.428 --> 49:52.261
Come on.

49:52.261 --> 49:54.553
I guess Ben Kim's
gonna get cuddled.

49:57.845 --> 49:59.512
Hey.

49:59.512 --> 50:00.804
Good luck.

50:06.428 --> 50:09.011
Ok everyone!
I love the effort.

50:09.011 --> 50:10.804
And seeing your beautiful
fucking faces.

50:10.804 --> 50:12.679
But you've done enough.

50:12.679 --> 50:17.136
So fuck off out of here and
enjoy the rest of your holiday.

50:17.136 --> 50:18.887
Now, when you get home,

50:18.887 --> 50:20.887
you will find a case
of champagne from me.

50:20.887 --> 50:22.804
And a tin of caviar.

50:22.804 --> 50:25.220
You'll have to order
your own pizza, okay?

50:25.220 --> 50:26.720
So, eat up, drink up.

50:26.720 --> 50:29.220
And then get yourselves ready
to get back here

50:29.220 --> 50:30.970
for when the market opens

50:30.970 --> 50:34.220
ready to motherfucking
destroy for me.

50:39.720 --> 50:40.720
Come on!

51:04.428 --> 51:06.762
I really thought
we were done with this.

51:06.762 --> 51:08.512
One last conversation.

51:08.512 --> 51:10.220
One last ask?

51:11.845 --> 51:14.178
Are you hoping I just don't
show up to the Med Board

51:14.178 --> 51:16.095
or are you going to
ask me not to?

51:16.095 --> 51:18.970
Whichever.

51:18.970 --> 51:23.261
Look.
All I want to say is:

51:23.261 --> 51:25.804
I'm sorry.

51:25.804 --> 51:30.220
I am truly sorry.

51:30.220 --> 51:32.887
Some kind of desire for revenge,

51:32.887 --> 51:36.470
or competitiveness, or bloodlust

51:36.470 --> 51:38.220
got a hold of me
and let me go too far.

51:38.220 --> 51:42.887
No, I... I
let myself go too far.

51:42.887 --> 51:45.178
I'd say way too fucking far.

51:45.178 --> 51:49.428
But know this:

51:49.428 --> 51:51.470
you say you don't want to
end up like Axe. Or me.

51:51.470 --> 51:55.095
Well, that's where this
kind of vengeance leads.

51:55.095 --> 52:00.261
It's ugly, it's sickening

52:00.261 --> 52:03.178
and I don't recommend it,
to my worst enemy.

52:03.178 --> 52:05.470
Much less someone I once
cared so much for,

52:05.470 --> 52:09.470
and... and still, oddly do.

52:09.470 --> 52:12.762
Your apology isn't real.

52:12.762 --> 52:14.178
Do I need to impress upon you

52:14.178 --> 52:16.428
how much my medical license
means to me?

52:16.428 --> 52:19.720
This, like everything with you,
is now merely transactional.

52:19.720 --> 52:21.679
That's who and what you are.

52:21.679 --> 52:24.053
So you have to actually
ask me not to show up.

52:24.053 --> 52:25.512
As a personal favor to you.

52:25.512 --> 52:27.261
You have to say the words.

52:27.261 --> 52:31.845
Please don't come
to the hearing.

52:31.845 --> 52:34.303
Do that for me.

52:34.303 --> 52:37.345
You are torn up, Wendy.

52:37.345 --> 52:39.887
The look in your eye tells me
that there is still,

52:39.887 --> 52:43.428
somewhere inside of you, someone
who knows right from wrong.

52:43.428 --> 52:45.595
This hearing is your chance
to reclaim that person.

52:45.595 --> 52:47.261
I am not setting you up
for defeat.

52:47.261 --> 52:49.470
I am giving you a chance
to save yourself.

52:54.303 --> 52:57.011
And, in fact, that decides it.

52:57.011 --> 52:58.220
I won't come to the hearing.

52:58.220 --> 53:00.845
If you think you should
keep your license

53:00.845 --> 53:04.303
so you can continue to
treat people, tell them why.

53:04.303 --> 53:06.345
And I won't be there
to tell them any different.

53:11.637 --> 53:14.428
I will.
Thank you.

53:14.428 --> 53:16.053
I owe you one.

53:16.053 --> 53:18.387
You do.

53:18.387 --> 53:20.887
But you owe yourself even more.

53:45.470 --> 53:47.345
Come on.
Seriously?

53:47.345 --> 53:48.845
No. No. No. No. No.
You're doing this.

53:48.845 --> 53:52.387
You can. And will.

53:54.470 --> 53:55.762
You know what this symbol is?

53:55.762 --> 53:57.095
Yeah. Divine wind.

53:57.095 --> 53:58.929
Kamikaze. Right?

53:58.929 --> 54:00.387
Who made the ultimate sacrifice

54:00.387 --> 54:02.261
for their emperor,
their nation, their ideals.

54:02.261 --> 54:04.345
But the board?
The metaphor I get,

54:04.345 --> 54:07.095
but this isn't... it's not
kids' karate class.

54:07.095 --> 54:08.762
Go beyond the metaphor.

54:08.762 --> 54:10.345
Break through it.

54:10.345 --> 54:12.261
Feel it.

54:17.261 --> 54:18.720
Hyah!

54:18.720 --> 54:20.261
Do you see that?

54:20.261 --> 54:23.553
Do you see, Bryan,
nothing makes you feel

54:23.553 --> 54:27.095
the purest version of yourself
more than going kamikaze.

54:27.095 --> 54:30.387
I want you to make
an all-out attack on success.

54:30.387 --> 54:31.637
Hmm.

54:31.637 --> 54:33.387
The kamikaze get a bad name

54:33.387 --> 54:36.053
because everyone wants
to focus on the suicide.

54:36.053 --> 54:38.220
But what they miss out on

54:38.220 --> 54:41.720
is the purity of the commitment.

54:41.720 --> 54:43.011
Hmm.

54:43.011 --> 54:44.470
Good.

54:48.679 --> 54:50.303
Again!

54:50.303 --> 54:51.679
Ah!
Yeah!

54:51.679 --> 54:52.720
Yeah!
Ah!

54:52.720 --> 54:54.303
Yeah!
Yeah!

54:54.303 --> 54:56.679
Oh! One more!

55:06.637 --> 55:08.637
You figure out your strategy?

55:08.637 --> 55:12.595
Things were done,
moves were made.

55:12.595 --> 55:15.136
Good.

55:15.136 --> 55:17.553
And your thing?

55:17.553 --> 55:20.804
Productive.

55:20.804 --> 55:23.428
Great.

55:27.804 --> 55:31.720
Chuck, when did you know
you needed to marry me?

55:34.011 --> 55:38.762
I mean the... the exact moment

55:38.762 --> 55:41.011
and why.

55:48.178 --> 55:49.929
One single moment?
Uh...

55:56.220 --> 55:58.887
...I don't remember.

56:08.053 --> 56:10.679
Hey, kids! Dinner!

56:43.261 --> 56:44.428
...sipping
fucking Jamesons

56:44.428 --> 56:46.428
in your fancy fucking jeans

56:46.428 --> 56:48.887
and your hundred dollar haircuts
and your BMWs.

56:48.887 --> 56:51.929
You only remember you're Irish
on St. Paddy's Day and Easter.

56:51.929 --> 56:53.387
Believe this guy?

56:53.387 --> 56:55.136
You know what? Fuck...

57:02.720 --> 57:04.387
Don't even fucking
think about it.

57:04.387 --> 57:06.428
Ah, what the fuck, Jackie?

57:06.428 --> 57:08.720
He fell.

57:08.720 --> 57:09.762
Both of 'em?

57:09.762 --> 57:11.303
They're fucking clumsy.

57:11.303 --> 57:13.595
Bryan. Get your brother
outta here, would ya?

57:13.595 --> 57:16.220
'So you know: I had those fake
fucking Irish pricks...

57:16.220 --> 57:17.762
Yeah, course you did.

57:17.762 --> 57:19.345
And when was the last time
you've been over in Belfast

57:19.345 --> 57:20.970
supporting the cause?
Well. That'd be never.

57:20.970 --> 57:22.345
C'mon...

57:22.345 --> 57:25.303
Yeah, but I did
go to Cape Cod once...

57:28.053 --> 57:32.303
So, baby brother,

57:32.303 --> 57:34.136
haven't seen you in years.

57:34.136 --> 57:36.136
'Cause you don't come to Ma's
for Christmas anymore.

57:36.136 --> 57:38.303
I don't like her ham...

57:38.303 --> 57:41.387
But you suddenly
showing up here...

57:41.387 --> 57:43.178
Must mean you want something.

57:45.637 --> 57:47.720
What is it you want?

57:47.720 --> 57:50.512
The one thing you do with those
hands better than fight.

57:53.261 --> 57:55.053
There's a safe?

57:55.053 --> 57:57.887
You bet your ass there is.
