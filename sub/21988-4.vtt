WEBVTT

00:03.771 --> 00:05.739
(thunder crashes)

00:05.773 --> 00:07.775
("Toccata and Fugue in D minor"
playing)

00:18.219 --> 00:19.820
Hmm.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.655
I'm not sure.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.824
What do you think?

00:23.857 --> 00:25.793
He was stabbed, genius.
No, it can't be.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.195
That's too obvious.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.797
This is so boring.
Can we please go?

00:29.830 --> 00:32.466
We just got here.
Stop being a killjoy.

00:32.500 --> 00:33.767
(sighs)

00:33.801 --> 00:35.469
(upbeat hip-hop music playing)

00:35.503 --> 00:37.105
* Yeah...

00:37.138 --> 00:40.308
I bet he was poisoned
by some rare flower extract,

00:40.341 --> 00:43.577
but the killer stabbed him
to throw us off the scent.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.479
I have read enough Agatha
Christie novels to know

00:45.513 --> 00:48.516
that the simplest explanation
is never the right one.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.518
Wow. You cracked the case.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.586
Fifth year of college
is really paying off.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.622
(grunting)

00:58.626 --> 00:59.860
Yes!

00:59.893 --> 01:02.096
Another one bites the dust.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.731
See, this is why
you're single.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.599
Can't believe
how cheesy this is.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.701
That blood looks totally fake.

01:07.735 --> 01:10.271
He's not faking, Sarah.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.306
This isn't part of the show.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.677
*

01:45.206 --> 01:46.774
ROSS (over TV): And on
to weather, Hurricane Molly

01:46.807 --> 01:49.143
has been upgraded
to a Category 3 storm,

01:49.177 --> 01:52.213
with winds reaching
up to 125 miles an hour.

01:52.246 --> 01:53.714
Molly is expected
to make landfall

01:53.747 --> 01:55.149
within the next 48 hours,

01:55.183 --> 01:56.817
as local businesses
and residents

01:56.850 --> 01:58.919
continue to make preparations.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.255
The military has also begun
hurricane sortie operations,

02:01.289 --> 02:03.624
with ships departing
Norfolk naval base

02:03.657 --> 02:05.826
and Little Creek
today and tomorrow.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.861
(TV clicks off)

02:13.901 --> 02:16.670
(urgent knocking)

02:18.606 --> 02:20.174
(doorbell ringing)

02:20.208 --> 02:21.675
Yeah!

02:23.311 --> 02:25.413
I hear you! Hey, hold on.

02:25.446 --> 02:29.217
Holy cow, you're a sight
for sore eyes.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.219
I went to five other houses
on the block.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.886
No one was home.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.688
Thanks for letting me in.

02:34.722 --> 02:35.823
I didn't.

02:35.856 --> 02:37.325
Boy, it's really
coming down out there.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.927
We don't have many hurricanes
in California.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.762
Earthquakes, but...
You know what I mean?

02:41.795 --> 02:44.232
No. (chuckles)

02:44.265 --> 02:45.699
Who are you?

02:45.733 --> 02:48.402
Oh, sorry about that.

02:48.436 --> 02:50.438
Uh, Jacqueline Sloane.

02:50.471 --> 02:52.306
Don't worry.
I'm not a weirdo.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.707
My car broke down

02:53.741 --> 02:55.943
around the corner,
and my cell died,

02:55.976 --> 02:58.346
and it's a whole thing.

02:58.379 --> 03:00.248
Uh, maybe I can fix your car.
Let me get my tools.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.616
Oh, no, no, no. Please.
That's not necessary at all.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.718
It's a rental, so they'll...
they'll just take care of it.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.654
I just need a phone
to call a tow truck,

03:06.687 --> 03:08.689
and I'll be out of your hair.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.258
D-Do you drink coffee?

03:10.291 --> 03:12.860
Uh, yes. By the gallon.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.629
Well, come on in.
Take a load off.

03:15.663 --> 03:17.331
Thank you.

03:17.365 --> 03:20.334
Very much.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.670
How long do you think
it'll take them to get here?

03:22.703 --> 03:24.872
MAN:
It's backed up. Maybe two hours.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.707
Great. Thanks so much.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.342
You're welcome.

03:28.376 --> 03:31.312
Looks like I'm not the only one
stranded in this storm.

03:31.345 --> 03:33.414
They're gonna take
over two hours to get here.

03:33.447 --> 03:34.882
Could always be worse.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.650
Could still be outside.

03:36.684 --> 03:40.020
Ah, I see you're
a glass half full kind of guy.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.723
It depends what's in the glass.

03:42.756 --> 03:43.991
(chuckles)

03:44.024 --> 03:45.426
Here you go.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.463
What?

03:49.497 --> 03:50.898
People usually comment on it.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.032
Your flip phone?

03:52.065 --> 03:53.801
I love it.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.669
It's vintage.

03:55.703 --> 03:56.937
Goes with your style.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.707
The decor, the brick TV.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.309
It's all kind of retro-chic.

04:01.342 --> 04:02.843
It's very in right now.

04:02.876 --> 04:05.045
I didn't know it went out.

04:05.078 --> 04:09.450
Well, style is cyclical.

04:11.519 --> 04:13.387
I have to notice these things
in my job.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.389
Are you some kind of decorator?

04:15.423 --> 04:16.857
No. I wish.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.459
Maybe in a past life.

04:18.492 --> 04:21.295
In this life, I'm a doctor.

04:21.329 --> 04:22.996
Mmm.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.865
And what do you do?

04:24.898 --> 04:26.066
No, wait, wait, wait,
let me guess.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.435
You are a...

04:27.468 --> 04:30.371
carpenter.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.039
No, no, I got it.

04:32.072 --> 04:34.074
You...

04:34.107 --> 04:35.543
are a cowboy.

04:35.576 --> 04:37.311
(chuckling)
(phone ringing)

04:38.479 --> 04:41.081
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.417
Sure. On my way.

04:43.451 --> 04:45.052
I got to go.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.087
No problem.
I'll just wait outside

04:47.120 --> 04:48.889
till a tow truck comes.
Why?

04:48.922 --> 04:51.925
Stay as long as you need to.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.395
You're gonna leave
a complete stranger

04:54.428 --> 04:55.763
alone in your house?

04:55.796 --> 04:56.964
Yes.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.433
I could rob you blind.

04:59.467 --> 05:02.770
Lock up when you're done.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.506
Thanks for the coffee.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.576
(camera clicking)

05:08.609 --> 05:10.378
TORRES:
All right. Well, thank you.

05:10.411 --> 05:13.814
We'll, uh,
we'll stay in touch.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.516
Okay.

05:15.549 --> 05:16.917
That was crazy.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.520
Butler give you anything?
No. No, but, uh...

05:19.553 --> 05:21.054
you know, he stayed
in character the entire time.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.457
(chuckles): You got to admire
that kind of discipline.

05:23.491 --> 05:24.858
This place is amazing.

05:24.892 --> 05:26.460
Delilah and I
came here last month

05:26.494 --> 05:27.961
for their Game of Thrones
theme night.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.363
I went as Ser Jorah,

05:29.397 --> 05:31.064
she went as Khaleesi,

05:31.098 --> 05:32.466
Mother of Dragons.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.034
Mother of Dragons-- mother.
Get it?

05:34.067 --> 05:36.504
What the hell did he just say?

05:36.537 --> 05:38.038
I'm not your
nerd whisperer, Nick.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.474
Okay, look, I can get behind
the whole murder mystery thing,

05:40.508 --> 05:41.575
but the masquerade?

05:41.609 --> 05:43.076
I just... I don't like that.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.612
You know? I don't like
when people wear masks

05:44.645 --> 05:46.614
and they pretend to be
somebody else. That's just...

05:46.647 --> 05:47.948
that's just weird.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.483
That's just creepy, man.

05:49.517 --> 05:50.484
You're kidding, right?

05:50.518 --> 05:52.620
You were an undercover agent.

05:52.653 --> 05:53.887
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.389
(chuckles):
Okay.

05:55.423 --> 05:56.890
It's different, guys.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.892
'Kay? I'm not pretending
to be someone.

05:58.926 --> 06:01.094
I'm embodying someone.

06:01.128 --> 06:03.564
It's a big difference.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.933
You guys want to see
a little demonstration?
GIBBS: No.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.901
Okay, maybe later.
What do we know?

06:07.935 --> 06:10.904
Victim is Marine
First Lieutenant Ethan Wynn.

06:10.938 --> 06:13.507
25. Stationed out of Dam Neck.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.008
He was stabbed twice
in the abdomen

06:15.042 --> 06:16.610
in the service hallway.

06:16.644 --> 06:19.447
Stumbled into the dining room,
where he lost consciousness.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.650
TORRES: Two partygoers
found him, and they called 911.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.017
He was taken
to a local hospital,

06:24.051 --> 06:25.052
and he remains in the ICU.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.521
The local LEOs are trying
to contact the wife.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.490
Okay. McGee, Torres,
get to the hospital.

06:29.523 --> 06:30.624
See what he knows.

06:30.658 --> 06:33.026
Bishop, witnesses?

06:33.060 --> 06:34.562
Well, most were wearing masks,

06:34.595 --> 06:37.431
so no one recalls
seeing Ethan beforehand.

06:37.465 --> 06:39.066
A few guests
report hearing screams,

06:39.099 --> 06:42.570
but it was part of the show.
(floorboards creaking above)

06:42.603 --> 06:44.938
TORRES: To be undercover
is like being a chameleon.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.139
You know? You have to connect

06:46.173 --> 06:47.508
with the character
you're portraying.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.076
You have to understand
what drives them.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.444
That's what keeps them
authentic.

06:50.478 --> 06:51.545
Know what I mean?

06:51.579 --> 06:53.046
I stopped listening
a while ago.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.214
(scoffs)
Excuse me.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.116
Uh, we're looking
for Ethan Wynn's room.

06:56.149 --> 06:59.019
ETHAN: Get off me! (grunts)
NURSE: Calm down, Mr. Wynn.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.221
We found him.
ETHAN: Let me go!

07:01.254 --> 07:02.155
I can't stay here.
Please, sir!

07:02.189 --> 07:03.557
(grunting)

07:03.591 --> 07:04.692
Lieutenant, relax.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.560
I can't!
I need to call the police.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.061
We are the police.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.997
(grunting)

07:10.030 --> 07:11.965
Thank God.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.167
You have to help me.
I was attacked.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.703
Yeah, we know.
That's why we're here.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.471
No. You don't
understand.

07:17.505 --> 07:20.007
The guy who did this to me
took my wife.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.476
Please. You have
to find her.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.153
Okay, guys. Go ahead.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.155
Somebody ask me
what I did last night.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.557
Abby, what'd you do last night?

07:36.590 --> 07:39.059
McGee, so sweet of you to ask.

07:39.092 --> 07:41.929
So, there was a zombie
movie marathon last night,

07:41.962 --> 07:45.065
and I realized
how unprepared we are.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.567
Unprepared for what?

07:46.600 --> 07:48.602
The zombiepocalypse.

07:48.636 --> 07:49.970
The what now?

07:50.003 --> 07:51.204
ABBY:
I mean, think about it.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.707
We're doing all this emergency
response for Hurricane Molly

07:53.741 --> 07:56.109
because that's
what we're trained to do.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.011
But none of us are trained

07:58.045 --> 07:59.112
for the zombiepocalypse.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.715
Because it's not a thing.

08:01.749 --> 08:02.616
Not yet.

08:02.650 --> 08:05.285
But fear not,
because I have taken matters

08:05.318 --> 08:06.720
into my own hands.

08:06.754 --> 08:09.289
I've made you all
an emergency kit,

08:09.322 --> 08:12.626
in case the undead decide
to rise, and I've put one

08:12.660 --> 08:14.227
in each one of your go bags.

08:14.261 --> 08:15.996
Yes!
Check it out.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.098
Hmm. What's in them?

08:18.131 --> 08:19.299
Oh, you know,
the essentials,

08:19.332 --> 08:21.101
like a compact mirror
for signaling,

08:21.134 --> 08:23.303
and, um, a makeup palette

08:23.336 --> 08:25.639
for any kind of
camouflage needs,

08:25.673 --> 08:27.107
and a beeper for communication.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.308
McGEE:
A beeper?

08:28.341 --> 08:29.643
BISHOP: Like an
old-fashioned beeper?

08:29.677 --> 08:31.211
Well... yeah.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.046
Okay, no need
to thank me.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.514
You guys enjoy.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.217
GIBBS:
Come on.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.952
Give me an update.

08:38.986 --> 08:42.222
Right. Our missing sailor
is Lieutenant J.G. Helen Wynn.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.124
26. A supply
officer stationed

08:44.157 --> 08:45.959
on the USS Ewing
out of Norfolk.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.695
BISHOP: According to her husband
First Lieutenant Ethan Wynn,

08:47.728 --> 08:49.763
the two were cornered

08:49.797 --> 08:52.232
at the murder mystery dinner
by a man in a devil costume.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.601
He stabbed Ethan,

08:53.634 --> 08:55.202
took Helen,
fled in the Wynns' car.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.704
BOLO's already out on him.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.071
What's the condition
of the husband?

08:58.105 --> 08:59.673
Both stab wounds
missed any vital organs.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.141
Yeah, Helen's mother
has been notified.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.643
She's on her way in now.

09:02.676 --> 09:05.145
Bishop, Torres,
get on board her ship.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.346
See what you can find out.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.215
Uh, Gibbs, the USS Ewing

09:08.248 --> 09:10.651
left Norfolk early this morning
'cause of the-the hurricane.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.786
Take a helo. Go on.
Get out there.

09:12.820 --> 09:17.224
Flying to a ship at sea
in the middle of a hurricane.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.993
(scoffs): Yeah.
What could go wrong?

09:20.027 --> 09:22.095
I don't care that you're doing
everything in your power.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.363
It's not good enough.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.632
My daughter's missing.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.299
Call the FBI.
We've done that.

09:26.333 --> 09:29.369
Mrs. Belmont, I promise you
all available agencies

09:29.402 --> 09:31.171
are looking for Helen.

09:31.204 --> 09:32.305
I told her something
like this would happen,

09:32.339 --> 09:33.306
but she just
didn't listen.

09:33.340 --> 09:36.176
You're saying
you know why Helen was taken?

09:36.209 --> 09:37.377
Of course I do.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.047
Someone's obviously
after her money.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.248
What money?

09:41.281 --> 09:42.783
We're Belmonts.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.385
As in the Belmont soap empire.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.055
My daughter is a very
wealthy young woman.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.191
Helen went against my wishes
by joining the military.

09:51.224 --> 09:52.760
I don't know what
she was thinking.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.662
She wanted to serve her country.

09:54.695 --> 09:55.863
Oh, please.

09:55.896 --> 09:58.065
Save it
for the recruitment video.

09:58.098 --> 10:02.269
This is not the future
I envisioned for her.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.871
Did many know
about Helen's money?

10:03.904 --> 10:05.272
I can't imagine so.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.074
She didn't like
to talk about it.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.742
She didn't want people
to treat her differently.

10:08.776 --> 10:10.678
Even that...

10:10.711 --> 10:12.680
husband of hers
didn't find out about it

10:12.713 --> 10:14.147
until after the wedding.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.116
You had issues with Ethan Wynn?

10:16.149 --> 10:17.217
He robbed me

10:17.250 --> 10:18.686
of giving my baby a wedding.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.654
Instead of an elegant ceremony,

10:20.688 --> 10:23.824
they eloped
at the county courthouse.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.358
You're married;
you understand.

10:25.392 --> 10:28.295
I got married, uh,
in my apartment, actually.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.230
Rent or own?

10:30.263 --> 10:31.699
Rent.

10:31.732 --> 10:32.833
Dear God.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.103
Let me make this very simple.

10:36.136 --> 10:40.140
Whatever ransom her captor
is demanding, I will pay it.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.776
A ransom hasn't been asked.

10:42.810 --> 10:45.078
It will.

10:45.112 --> 10:49.182
And when it does,
I will get you the money,

10:49.216 --> 10:53.787
but I want you to bring
my daughter back unscathed.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.124
Dr. Mallard
pulls these off so well,

10:57.157 --> 10:59.459
but I don't think
I have the right neck for it.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.896
Guy at the zoo did say
I have giraffe-like features.

11:02.930 --> 11:05.132
What's wrong with
how you usually dress?

11:05.165 --> 11:07.467
This week is my first
official week flying solo.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.770
I thought that wearing
one of the doctor's bowties

11:09.803 --> 11:13.907
would make me feel less anxious
about filling his shoes.

11:13.941 --> 11:18.178
You have handled things
by yourself before.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.813
You're gonna be great.

11:19.847 --> 11:22.382
You don't have to be
an imitation of Ducky.

11:22.415 --> 11:25.485
You just have
to be Jimmy.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.187
You know, you're right.

11:27.220 --> 11:30.724
I am a fully capable
medical examiner.

11:30.758 --> 11:33.493
This is my opportunity.
This is my chance.

11:33.526 --> 11:36.229
This is my shot.
No!

11:36.263 --> 11:39.499
No! Please don't start
singing Hamilton again, okay?

11:39.532 --> 11:41.434
'Cause it gets stuck
in my head, like, all day.

11:41.468 --> 11:42.936
I can't help it.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.337
It's educational and
it's entertaining.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.939
Speaking of educational,

11:45.973 --> 11:48.441
I'm trying to learn more
about Helen Wynn's abductor.

11:48.475 --> 11:49.910
Yeah? What do you got?

11:49.943 --> 11:51.311
Well, since there were

11:51.344 --> 11:53.280
no cameras
at the murder-mystery dinner,

11:53.313 --> 11:57.284
I started searching through
Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook

11:57.317 --> 12:00.387
to find any posts that were
taken there that night,

12:00.420 --> 12:02.856
and I found this video.

12:02.890 --> 12:06.526
That's Ethan and Helen Wynn
at the top of the stairs.

12:06.559 --> 12:10.297
And there, in the background,
is our suspect

12:10.330 --> 12:11.865
dressed in a
devil's costume.

12:11.899 --> 12:14.434
Now watch what
devil man does.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.871
He waits for Helen
and Ethan Wynn to walk by,

12:17.905 --> 12:19.306
and then he follows them.

12:19.339 --> 12:20.507
And he was prepared.

12:20.540 --> 12:24.011
That is a compact river knife.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.513
The size of the blade
matches the injuries

12:26.546 --> 12:28.248
that Ethan sustained.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.418
(thunder rumbling)

12:33.921 --> 12:35.889
That's rather ominous.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.891
(people murmuring)

12:37.925 --> 12:39.993
VANCE: Everyone, may I have
your attention?

12:40.027 --> 12:42.229
Due to the worsening
weather conditions,

12:42.262 --> 12:45.198
I'm ordering all
nonessential NCIS personnel

12:45.232 --> 12:49.502
to evacuate the Navy Yard
until further notice. Thank you.

12:49.536 --> 12:50.437
McGEE:
Boss, what do we...?

12:50.470 --> 12:53.006
We're not going anywhere.
What do you got?

12:53.040 --> 12:55.575
I went through Helen Wynn's
cell phone records.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.577
Now, the final call
she made yesterday was

12:57.610 --> 12:59.379
to this man: Mitch Greyson.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.014
He's a civilian employee

13:01.048 --> 13:04.017
at the National Armed Forces
Credit Union.

13:04.051 --> 13:05.853
Logs indicate
that they exchanged

13:05.886 --> 13:07.454
a few calls
over the past few weeks.

13:07.487 --> 13:10.357
Yeah, go, check him out.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.525
Hey, cowboy. Catch.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.370
Boss, you know her?

13:23.403 --> 13:25.505
Apparently not.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.240
Congratulations.
How are you?

13:27.274 --> 13:28.508
Hi, Jack.
How are you?

13:28.541 --> 13:31.912
Were those your house keys
that she just gave you?

13:33.646 --> 13:35.983
Sorry. Norfolk. On it.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.258
Oh. Very nice.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.060
Thank you.

13:47.094 --> 13:49.429
Very good to see you,
Special Agent Sloane.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.031
Can I make you some coffee?

13:51.064 --> 13:53.533
Yes, thank you.
You still take it
the same way?

13:53.566 --> 13:55.969
Black, three sugars,
more sugar, then coffee.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.971
Got it. You know,
I got to say,

13:58.005 --> 14:00.007
I never thought I'd
live to see the day

14:00.040 --> 14:02.642
that you would relocate
to the East Coast.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.979
Well, you shouldn't be that
surprised. It was your idea.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.047
I was always
under the impression

14:07.080 --> 14:08.982
that you would rather quit
than leave California.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.018
Oh, believe, me,
I thought about it.

14:11.051 --> 14:14.654
Well, I'm very glad
that you reconsidered.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.656
Headquarters can
certainly benefit

14:16.689 --> 14:19.526
from a skilled forensic
psychologist such as yourself.

14:19.559 --> 14:22.930
Well, I go where I'm needed.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.365
But I have to say,
I was hesitant at first.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.935
This office does have
quite the reputation.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.102
Oh, really?

14:29.136 --> 14:31.404
Yes. Every week,
I would hear a new story

14:31.438 --> 14:34.908
about a certain hard-to-handle
agent who crossed some line,

14:34.942 --> 14:38.111
but I'm sure that's
just pure urban legend.

14:38.145 --> 14:40.413
I'd say it's 50-50.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.582
Yikes.

14:42.615 --> 14:45.485
Mm. I wasn't sure

14:45.518 --> 14:47.587
how our personalities
would mesh together.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.689
So, what changed your mind?

14:49.722 --> 14:53.393
Like any agent worth their salt,

14:53.426 --> 14:56.096
I did a little recon
on my subject.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.431
Really? What did you deduce?

14:58.465 --> 15:02.035
Let's just say I'm looking
forward to a new challenge.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.037
Well, you certainly

15:04.071 --> 15:06.039
picked one hell
of a day to start.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.040
(thunder rumbling)

15:07.074 --> 15:08.575
Big storm coming.

15:08.608 --> 15:11.411
You have no idea.

15:14.982 --> 15:18.451
Jack, I know you took this
assignment as a favor to me.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.053
I appreciate it.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.055
It's the least I could do, Leon.

15:22.089 --> 15:23.590
I owe you.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.593
No. That was
a long time ago, Jack.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.495
That debt's been paid.

15:30.397 --> 15:33.066
No, it hasn't.
Not even close.

15:33.100 --> 15:36.603
Welcome to your new home,
Agent Sloane.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.639
Thank you, Director Vance.

15:39.672 --> 15:42.542
I am looking forward to it.

15:44.644 --> 15:48.415
(helicopter blades whirring)

15:48.448 --> 15:50.450
(thunder crashing)

15:53.120 --> 15:54.654
TORRES:
Hey.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.656
Is it safe
for a ship to be out

15:56.689 --> 15:59.993
at sea in the middle
of a hurricane?

16:00.027 --> 16:02.095
Safer than being in port, sir.

16:02.129 --> 16:04.631
Feels like a ghost ship.
Where's everybody else?

16:04.664 --> 16:07.434
We operate with a small skeleton
crew during sorties like this.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.435
How many on board?

16:08.468 --> 16:09.769
40. This way if the ship sinks,

16:09.802 --> 16:11.471
we don't lose the entire crew.

16:11.504 --> 16:15.108
(laughs) Got a weird
sense of humor there, Smiddy.

16:15.142 --> 16:18.211
Wasn't a joke, sir.
This way.

16:18.245 --> 16:20.580
BISHOP: Is Helen Wynn's
department head standing by?

16:20.613 --> 16:23.616
No, ma'am. Lieutenant Simoni
is on leave in Japan

16:23.650 --> 16:25.685
right now, but our X.O.
is waiting to assist you.

16:25.718 --> 16:28.121
Commander Thomas Buckner.
Oh.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.223
I knew a Tommy Buckner
back in Oklahoma.

16:30.257 --> 16:32.692
An ex-boyfriend of yours?
(chuckles) Hardly.

16:32.725 --> 16:36.129
He was one of the popular kids
who made my life miserable.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.731
I figured you more for
a, uh, homecoming queen.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.600
Far from.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.702
I was all knees and elbows.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.472
I spent most of my time
in the computer lab trying

16:45.505 --> 16:48.108
to avoi Buckner
and his friends.

16:48.141 --> 16:50.110
God, I hated that guy.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.811
Well, let's not hold it
against this guy

16:51.844 --> 16:53.646
because he has the same name.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.248
Sir, NCIS Agents Torres
and Bishop.

16:56.716 --> 16:59.619
Ellie Bishop? Is that you?

16:59.652 --> 17:01.688
You've got to be kidding me.

17:01.721 --> 17:04.624
No.

17:04.657 --> 17:07.494
Now, okay, this just got
really interesting.

17:17.737 --> 17:20.807
I cannot believe it.
What a small world it is.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.075
(chuckles)

17:22.109 --> 17:23.743
Yeah, it's something.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.712
Yeah, it's something.

17:25.745 --> 17:28.515
So, uh, how long
has it been, huh,

17:28.548 --> 17:31.151
since you two crazy kids
have seen each other?

17:31.184 --> 17:33.653
Not since high school.
I mean, Scarecrow here

17:33.686 --> 17:35.588
never showed up
to any of our reunions, so...

17:35.622 --> 17:37.190
And there's why.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.825
So, how've you been?

17:38.858 --> 17:40.493
I mean, you-you look great.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.495
Being an agent
certainly agrees with you.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.164
Well, we're here
on business, Buckner,

17:44.197 --> 17:45.798
not a trip down memory lane.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.800
(clears throat)

17:47.834 --> 17:49.336
Of course.

17:49.369 --> 17:50.870
Roger that.

17:50.903 --> 17:54.107
So, how can I help NCIS today?

17:54.141 --> 17:56.609
Well, you can tell us about
Lieutenant J.G. Wynn.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.678
Helen?
Mm.

17:58.711 --> 18:01.881
Well, she's been our services
officer for the past 18 months.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.216
She's hardworking, dedicated,

18:03.250 --> 18:04.784
never had any
disciplinary issues.

18:04.817 --> 18:07.287
Does she have any problems
with anyone on board?

18:07.320 --> 18:09.189
No, not that I'm aware of.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.824
Why didn't you report her U.A.
this morning?

18:11.858 --> 18:14.661
'Cause she's not U.A.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.196
Lieutenant Wynn

18:16.229 --> 18:19.232
wasn't slated to be
a part of the skeleton crew.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.134
What's all this about?

18:21.168 --> 18:23.336
Helen was abducted last night.

18:23.370 --> 18:26.739
Abducted?

18:26.773 --> 18:28.575
Oh, my God.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.678
I mean, you think
someone on board was involved?

18:31.711 --> 18:33.380
Well, we're looking
into everything.

18:33.413 --> 18:34.781
Time's a factor.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.249
Yeah, I-I understand.

18:36.283 --> 18:37.617
Um... (clears throat)

18:37.650 --> 18:38.918
How can I help?

18:38.951 --> 18:41.621
Uh, well,
we'll need Helen's files,

18:41.654 --> 18:44.257
crew evals
and access to her stateroom.

18:44.291 --> 18:47.260
Absolutely. Follow me.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.262
(thunder rumbling)

18:50.797 --> 18:53.166
Hey. Scarecrow?

18:53.200 --> 18:55.402
(scoffs) Don't ask.

18:55.435 --> 18:58.871
(siren wailing in distance)

18:58.905 --> 19:00.307
Mitch Greyson?

19:00.340 --> 19:02.575
I'm so sorry.
We're closing.

19:02.609 --> 19:05.578
NCIS. I'd like to ask you
a couple questions.

19:05.612 --> 19:08.681
Okay, yeah. Uh, you mind
if we make it quick?

19:08.715 --> 19:09.882
Base commander ordered us

19:09.916 --> 19:11.251
to shut down operations
and evacuate.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.820
How do you know this woman?

19:13.853 --> 19:15.622
Helen Wynn.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.956
She handles the USS Ewing's
bank account.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.225
I'm her financial liaison.

19:18.258 --> 19:19.692
And the
multiple calls

19:19.726 --> 19:21.694
you two exchanged
over the last two weeks--

19:21.728 --> 19:22.929
those were all banking related?

19:22.962 --> 19:25.365
We normally speak
only once a week

19:25.398 --> 19:26.799
to schedule times
for Helen to come in

19:26.833 --> 19:28.435
and make deposits
and withdrawals.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.970
But with the ship set
to deploy in the next ten days,

19:31.003 --> 19:33.206
there's more business
she needed to take care of.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.741
So, when was the last time

19:34.774 --> 19:36.443
you were in contact
with Lieutenant Wynn?

19:36.476 --> 19:38.745
We spoke late
yesterday afternoon.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.281
She was supposed to come by this
morning to pick up some checks,

19:41.314 --> 19:42.715
but she never showed.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.917
I mean, who can blame her
with this weather?

19:44.951 --> 19:47.254
Why are you asking?

19:47.287 --> 19:48.821
Is Helen okay?

19:48.855 --> 19:50.823
BUCKNER:
No way.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.959
So you were a striker, too, huh?
Oh, yeah, all-state

19:52.992 --> 19:53.960
my senior year.

19:54.894 --> 19:55.828
What about you?

19:55.862 --> 19:56.729
Can't complain.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.465
Full athletic scholarship
to Syracuse.

19:58.498 --> 19:59.466
Whoa.

19:59.499 --> 20:00.767
Most impressive.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.835
Yeah. No, I don't like
to brag or anything.

20:02.869 --> 20:03.836
Since when?

20:03.870 --> 20:05.238
TORRES:
Okay, so,

20:05.272 --> 20:06.739
I-I have to know.

20:06.773 --> 20:08.741
What was teenage Bishop like?

20:08.775 --> 20:10.843
She was an individual.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.480
Never really followed the crowd.
Didn't really seem to care

20:13.513 --> 20:16.316
what other people thought.
It was, uh... it was refreshing.

20:16.349 --> 20:19.252
Oh, yeah?
What's up with that nickname?

20:19.286 --> 20:21.754
Scarecrow.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.490
Well, Bishop used to wear these,

20:23.523 --> 20:25.392
um, oversized
patchwork overalls,

20:25.425 --> 20:27.494
and had this straw-like
blonde hair.

20:27.527 --> 20:28.995
She was never really around
a group of friends,

20:29.028 --> 20:30.963
kind of always
on her own, so,

20:30.997 --> 20:33.900
thinking back, I guess that
wasn't a really nice nickname.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.034
You think?

20:35.067 --> 20:37.670
Look, I get it. I mean,
high school kids can be cruel.

20:37.704 --> 20:39.372
They gave me a nickname,
and I hated it.

20:39.406 --> 20:42.875
Uh... they called you
"Thomas the Adonis."

20:42.909 --> 20:45.312
It's not exactly the same thing.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.347
Look, that was all
a long time ago, right?

20:47.380 --> 20:49.316
I mean, look at you now.
You're a kick-ass federal agent.

20:49.349 --> 20:50.717
Very cool.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.386
I am glad you're impressed.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.888
Uh, look, I need to search
Helen's disbursing office.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.024
No can do.
I don't have access.

20:58.057 --> 20:59.459
You're the X.O. of the ship.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.361
Well, disbursing
is a secure space.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.896
And DoD regulations stipulate
that only Helen and her clerk

21:03.930 --> 21:06.866
are allowed the keys,
and neither are on board.
(knocking)

21:06.899 --> 21:09.302
Excuse me, sir, there's an Agent
Gibbs calling on the sat phone.

21:10.537 --> 21:11.971
Uh, thanks.

21:12.004 --> 21:12.905
Gibbs.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.942
Uh, no, we haven't found
anything on board.

21:15.975 --> 21:18.511
Any word from Helen's captor?
No, negative.

21:18.545 --> 21:20.947
I mean, it's been 24 hours
since she was taken.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.982
Shouldn't a ransom
have been made by now?

21:23.015 --> 21:24.984
I don't think
this is about ransom.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.421
Boss, BOLO came back
on Helen's car.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.723
Park ranger spotted it
near Lake Drummond.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.024
Okay. Get the first helo out.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.393
I want you and Torres

21:33.426 --> 21:34.527
back in D.C., ASAP.

21:36.863 --> 21:39.766
Agents McGee and Gibbs, I'd
like to introduce you to...

21:39.799 --> 21:42.101
Special Agent Jack Sloane.
Yeah, we know.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.536
We do?

21:44.771 --> 21:46.005
Uh, nice to meet you.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.740
McGEE:
Hi.

21:47.774 --> 21:49.442
Nice to meet y-you, officially.

21:49.476 --> 21:50.743
You have a minute?

21:50.777 --> 21:51.844
Nope.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.813
Ouch.

21:53.846 --> 21:56.048
Looks like a "fool me once"
kind of guy.

21:56.082 --> 21:57.450
This way.

21:57.484 --> 21:58.785
Thank you.

22:03.055 --> 22:05.091
Here you go.
Put your gear on.

22:05.124 --> 22:08.094
What are you waiting for?
Let's go. Chop, chop. Come on.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.462
Why? Are you flying the helo?

22:09.496 --> 22:12.031
No. Just...
Then chill the hell out.

22:12.064 --> 22:14.066
Oh, my God. I just want
to get off of this ship

22:14.100 --> 22:16.403
and as far away from Buckner
as possible, so...

22:16.436 --> 22:19.105
Yeah, you know what? I meant
to talk to you about that.

22:19.138 --> 22:20.873
You're being kind of
rude to the guy.

22:20.907 --> 22:22.875
(laughs) I was rude to him?

22:22.909 --> 22:24.877
Yeah! He's kind of
a cool dude, man.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.613
You know, he's saying the
nicest things about you.

22:26.646 --> 22:28.147
I think you got
the guy all wrong.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.483
Okay, "man."
The guy is playing you.

22:30.517 --> 22:32.385
Believe me, it is all an act.

22:32.419 --> 22:34.854
Okay, maybe he was
an ass as a kid.

22:34.887 --> 22:36.523
High school was
a long time ago.

22:36.556 --> 22:37.557
You got to get over it.

22:42.562 --> 22:44.997
You know, that is easy
for you to say.

22:45.031 --> 22:48.601
Y-You were a-a popular jock,
like Buckner, okay?

22:48.635 --> 22:51.103
You have no idea
what it was like to be mocked

22:51.137 --> 22:53.606
and laughed at every day.
A-And the only reason

22:53.640 --> 22:55.942
Buckner even let up was
because of my brothers, so...

22:55.975 --> 22:59.078
What'd they do, break his leg?

22:59.111 --> 23:01.080
No, two of his fingers.

23:02.148 --> 23:04.183
Wish they were here now.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.820
Hey, look, Bishop, I'm sorry.

23:07.854 --> 23:10.523
I'm not trying to be insensitive
about it, okay?

23:10.557 --> 23:12.492
It's just, I can tell
that he bothers you.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.193
Why don't you go up to him,
go talk to him.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.928
Tell him.
Tell him how you feel.

23:15.962 --> 23:18.197
I don't want to talk
about this anymore, okay?

23:18.230 --> 23:19.999
Just want to get off
of this ship!

23:20.032 --> 23:21.067
(door opens)

23:21.100 --> 23:22.969
(thunder crashing)

23:24.871 --> 23:26.539
Hey. Uh, is the helo ready yet?

23:26.573 --> 23:27.874
Uh, I'm sorry, ma'am.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.141
Sea conditions
have deteriorated.

23:29.175 --> 23:30.610
All flight ops
have been cancelled.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.579
For how long?
Until the storm passes.

23:32.612 --> 23:35.915
I'm afraid you're both stuck
on board for the time being.

23:40.052 --> 23:42.855
McGEE:
Deputies secured the area.

23:42.889 --> 23:45.892
No one's been in or out
since we got the call.

23:45.925 --> 23:49.696
It's a closed access road,
very off the beaten path.

23:49.729 --> 23:51.631
Not a lot of foot traffic.

23:51.664 --> 23:54.901
Whoever dumped the car
knew the area.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.470
Yeah, I used to come here
as a Webelos, boss.

23:57.504 --> 24:01.574
There's a, uh, a weather station
about a half mile up the ridge.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.943
Maybe we'll find
Helen there.

24:09.616 --> 24:11.217
We already did!

24:23.229 --> 24:26.499
JIMMY: I might not wax poetic
as well as Dr. Mallard,

24:26.533 --> 24:31.070
but I can assure you
my work is just as thorough.

24:31.103 --> 24:32.539
(knock on door)

24:32.572 --> 24:34.741
Ah, Agent Gibbs.
Right on time.

24:34.774 --> 24:37.009
I don't mean
to disappoint you.

24:37.043 --> 24:38.277
Sorry to interrupt.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.046
I'm Special Agent
Jack Sloane.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.549
As in Jack Sloane,
doctor of forensic psychology?

24:42.582 --> 24:45.284
Mm-hmm.
Oh, Dr. Mallard's
talked about you.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.654
He's a big fan
of your work.

24:47.687 --> 24:49.656
Ah, you must be Dr. Palmer.
From what I hear,

24:49.689 --> 24:51.624
he's a big fan
of your work, as well.
Me?

24:51.658 --> 24:53.926
(chuckles)
I don't know about that.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.061
Well, think about it.

24:55.094 --> 24:57.930
Would Dr. Mallard entrust
his job with just anyone?

24:57.964 --> 24:59.265
Point taken, yeah.

24:59.298 --> 25:01.033
Care to show me
what you got?

25:01.067 --> 25:02.168
Certainly, yes.

25:02.201 --> 25:06.505
Our victim here is Lieutenant...

25:07.607 --> 25:09.576
Agent Gibbs,

25:09.609 --> 25:11.277
I was just about to
go over my findings.

25:11.310 --> 25:12.745
By all means.

25:16.248 --> 25:19.118
Awkward silences make me
extremely uncomfortable,

25:19.151 --> 25:20.753
so I'm just gonna keep talking.

25:20.787 --> 25:22.955
Lieutenant Wynn's
cause of death

25:22.989 --> 25:25.057
was blunt force trauma
to the head.

25:25.091 --> 25:27.627
Now, judging by
the size of the wound

25:27.660 --> 25:29.228
and the moss-like debris
inside of it,

25:29.261 --> 25:31.297
I would say she was hit
with a large rock.

25:31.330 --> 25:33.766
Time of death?
Between 3:00 and 4:00 a.m.

25:33.800 --> 25:35.101
the night she was abducted.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.703
(clears throat)

25:38.738 --> 25:40.172
Sorry. Tickle in my throat.

25:40.206 --> 25:41.674
What else?

25:41.708 --> 25:44.243
I found some fibers
under her fingernails.

25:44.276 --> 25:47.146
Now, Abby has since confirmed
that it's red nylon,

25:47.179 --> 25:49.582
probably from the killer's
devil costume.

25:49.616 --> 25:50.650
GIBBS:
She fought back.

25:50.683 --> 25:51.718
(clears throat)

25:51.751 --> 25:55.187
Anything you'd like
to add, Jack?

25:55.221 --> 25:59.058
No. It's your... rodeo.

26:00.827 --> 26:04.697
But if you really did want
to hear my professional opinion,

26:04.731 --> 26:06.999
I'd say that murder wasn't
the killer's original intent.

26:07.033 --> 26:09.001
If so, he would
have used the knife

26:09.035 --> 26:11.337
he stabbed her husband with;
instead, he uses a rock.

26:11.370 --> 26:13.372
Look at this.
See how he ties her hands?

26:13.405 --> 26:15.207
They're bound in front,
not in the back,

26:15.241 --> 26:17.009
which is a better
stress position.

26:17.043 --> 26:20.613
And he ties a cloth
around the rope?

26:20.647 --> 26:22.615
He wanted to make her
comfortable.

26:22.649 --> 26:24.751
Pretty considerate for a killer,
wouldn't you say?

26:24.784 --> 26:28.020
Okay, so if he didn't want
to kill her, why did he?

26:28.054 --> 26:29.756
Something must have happened
and he panicked.

26:29.789 --> 26:31.858
Maybe Helen figured out
who her captor was.

26:31.891 --> 26:33.392
You think they knew each other?

26:33.425 --> 26:35.795
I think it was more than that.

26:35.828 --> 26:37.797
Your suspect
had feelings for her.

26:37.830 --> 26:40.032
Maybe even loved her.

26:40.066 --> 26:42.134
Know anyone who fits that bill?

26:42.168 --> 26:44.270
ETHAN:
What is wrong with you people?

26:44.303 --> 26:45.872
First you tell me
my wife is dead,

26:45.905 --> 26:47.674
and then you accuse me
of killing her?

26:47.707 --> 26:50.042
You don't even have an alibi.

26:50.076 --> 26:53.079
I was in the ho... (groans)
I was in the hospital.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.346
No, you weren't.

26:54.380 --> 26:56.248
You signed an A.M.A.
and you left at midnight,

26:56.282 --> 26:58.050
giving yourself plenty of time
to kill your wife

26:58.084 --> 26:59.786
and dump the car.

26:59.819 --> 27:03.155
I left the hospital that night
to go out and look for Helen.

27:03.189 --> 27:04.356
You have to believe me.

27:04.390 --> 27:05.692
Oh, no, we don't.

27:05.725 --> 27:07.293
Not if you keep lying.

27:07.326 --> 27:10.730
Divorce papers your wife
had her attorney draw up.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.433
Oops. Bet that slipped
your mind.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.102
ETHAN:
Look, six months ago,

27:16.135 --> 27:17.904
we decided to take
some time apart.

27:17.937 --> 27:19.772
We both started
seeing other people,

27:19.806 --> 27:22.308
but we soon realized how much
we still loved each other.

27:22.341 --> 27:24.410
We got back together
two weeks ago.

27:24.443 --> 27:27.714
Okay. So Helen postpones
the divorce, she dies.

27:27.747 --> 27:30.817
You inherit her millions;
that's convenient.

27:30.850 --> 27:33.720
Give me a polygraph, take
my DNA, do whatever you want.

27:33.753 --> 27:37.323
I didn't kill my wife, and
whoever did is still out there.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.258
McGEE: You said you were
seeing other people.

27:39.291 --> 27:41.160
Who was Helen dating?

27:41.193 --> 27:43.329
One of her coworkers.

27:43.362 --> 27:45.397
She said things got
a little uncomfortable at work

27:45.431 --> 27:47.466
when she broke things off
with him.

27:47.499 --> 27:50.803
She wouldn't tell me who it was,
but I had my suspicions.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.705
Who?

27:52.739 --> 27:54.741
Her X.O.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.909
Commander Buckner.

27:58.377 --> 27:59.746
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.948
That's not an answer, Commander.

28:01.981 --> 28:03.883
No, I'm not dating
Lieutenant Wynn.

28:03.916 --> 28:05.885
Why would the husband
think you were?

28:05.918 --> 28:07.954
I have no idea. Ask him.

28:07.987 --> 28:10.456
TORRES: Did. He said you
spent a lot of time together.

28:10.489 --> 28:12.491
We did.
We were on the same ship.

28:12.524 --> 28:15.494
Okay, enough! I'm sick
of your crap, Buckner.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.764
Just stop lying to us.

28:17.797 --> 28:20.900
I'm not lying to you, okay?
Helen and I were just friends.

28:20.933 --> 28:22.935
Executive officers
aren't friends

28:22.969 --> 28:24.837
with their
junior officers.

28:24.871 --> 28:26.305
You were her boss.

28:26.338 --> 28:27.506
So what was going on
between you?!

28:27.539 --> 28:29.241
Nothing!

28:29.275 --> 28:30.843
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

28:30.877 --> 28:32.444
(thunder rumbling)

28:36.182 --> 28:38.150
You really haven't changed
at all.

28:39.819 --> 28:43.389
You were a bully in high
school, and you still are.

28:43.422 --> 28:45.424
So, tell me,
what's the matter?

28:45.457 --> 28:48.527
Your-your fragile ego couldn't
handle getting dumped?

28:48.560 --> 28:51.898
Hmm? Helen used you,
rejected you,

28:51.931 --> 28:54.366
and you had to do something
about it, didn't you?

28:54.400 --> 28:56.402
That's why you killed her.

28:56.435 --> 28:59.271
Killed her?

28:59.305 --> 29:01.473
Helen's dead?

29:07.513 --> 29:10.516
Um...
(clears throat)

29:10.549 --> 29:12.885
Uh, I don't know what to say.

29:12.919 --> 29:15.321
We need details, Commander.

29:17.857 --> 29:20.426
After, uh...

29:20.459 --> 29:22.394
After Helen
and her husband separated,

29:22.428 --> 29:25.932
I could see she was going
through a tough time, so...

29:25.965 --> 29:28.467
I just wanted
to give her some guidance.

29:28.500 --> 29:31.037
Because you're so wise?

29:31.070 --> 29:32.939
Because I've been in her shoes.

29:32.972 --> 29:34.206
Mm.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.574
I went through
a divorce last year,

29:35.607 --> 29:37.910
and I know how tough
it can be.

29:37.944 --> 29:40.212
Ten years of marriage,

29:40.246 --> 29:43.482
and then it just...
all fell apart.

29:43.515 --> 29:48.320
I didn't want Helen to make
the same mistakes I did.

29:48.354 --> 29:50.522
Were the two of you ever
romantically involved?

29:50.556 --> 29:52.959
No.

29:52.992 --> 29:54.426
I would never

29:54.460 --> 29:56.562
cross that line.

29:56.595 --> 29:59.465
You must really despise me

29:59.498 --> 30:02.001
to think that I'm capable
of murder.

30:04.570 --> 30:07.539
You know, whatever it is
I did to you in high school,

30:07.573 --> 30:09.575
I'm truly sorry.

30:11.577 --> 30:14.546
But I'm not that guy anymore.

30:18.918 --> 30:20.853
Any word from
Bishop or Torres?

30:20.887 --> 30:22.421
Radio silence.

30:22.454 --> 30:24.356
The storm's knocked out
all lines of communication

30:24.390 --> 30:25.457
with the USS Ewing.

30:25.491 --> 30:26.625
I've been hailing the sat phone,

30:26.658 --> 30:28.594
but there's no answer.

30:28.627 --> 30:30.897
All right, keep trying.

30:30.930 --> 30:32.298
Yes, sir.

30:42.408 --> 30:44.410
Why is it that
everywhere I go, you go?

30:44.443 --> 30:46.012
Must be a coincidence.

30:46.045 --> 30:48.981
Rule 39: there's no
such thing as coincidence.

30:49.015 --> 30:51.450
I don't believe in absolutes.

30:53.452 --> 30:56.022
Something I can do for you?

30:56.055 --> 30:59.325
Yeah. Stop following me.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.093
You have a rule about
being paranoid, too?

31:01.127 --> 31:03.963
I was here first, so if
anything, you're following me.

31:03.996 --> 31:07.533
But I'll let it slide this time,
'cause I'm nice like that.

31:07.566 --> 31:09.635
What about your stunt
at my house?

31:09.668 --> 31:11.537
Oh, well, that's
a different story.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.672
To really understand
what makes a person tick,

31:13.705 --> 31:17.076
you have to interact with them
on their home turf.

31:17.109 --> 31:20.312
Yeah, or you could just ask.

31:20.346 --> 31:22.314
What's the fun in that?

31:22.348 --> 31:24.416
I don't like games.

31:24.450 --> 31:27.386
And I don't like
people lying to me.

31:27.419 --> 31:30.556
Then we are off to a bad start.

31:30.589 --> 31:35.427
You want in on my cases,
you need to come through me.

31:35.461 --> 31:37.563
No, actually, I don't.

31:37.596 --> 31:40.432
I answer to Director Vance,
not to you.

31:42.468 --> 31:44.036
Hey, look,

31:44.070 --> 31:46.572
I'm not...

31:46.605 --> 31:50.042
trying to step on
any toes here.

31:50.076 --> 31:53.045
My job is to provide insight
to help solve cases.

31:53.079 --> 31:55.714
Whether you decide
to utilize my expertise

31:55.747 --> 31:57.716
or not is up to you.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.518
You may not understand
my methods,

31:59.551 --> 32:00.953
but they work.

32:00.987 --> 32:02.955
I wanted to see
what kind of man you are.

32:02.989 --> 32:05.724
And what I saw is someone
who is driven to help people,

32:05.757 --> 32:08.460
even at the expense
of himself.

32:08.494 --> 32:10.162
And I asked myself,

32:10.196 --> 32:12.064
"Is this a person
I can work with?"

32:12.098 --> 32:15.934
And the answer was, "Hell yes."

32:17.136 --> 32:19.138
So, give it a chance, Gibbs.

32:21.140 --> 32:23.409
You'll like having me around,
I think.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.377
Why is that?

32:25.411 --> 32:28.714
'Cause you enjoy a good fight.

32:28.747 --> 32:32.218
(door opens, closes)

32:32.251 --> 32:33.986
Abby, hey,
got your message.

32:34.020 --> 32:35.521
(whispers):
Be very quiet.

32:35.554 --> 32:36.989
What are we whispering about?

32:37.023 --> 32:38.190
(thunder rumbling)

32:38.224 --> 32:40.092
I don't want to disturb
the power gods

32:40.126 --> 32:42.494
while I'm running
a database search.

32:42.528 --> 32:43.495
You found DNA?

32:43.529 --> 32:45.597
Well, yes and no.

32:45.631 --> 32:47.599
The fibers that Jimmy
pulled from underneath

32:47.633 --> 32:49.235
the victim's fingernails,
they had trace amounts of DNA.

32:49.268 --> 32:51.403
But I ran it through the system,
and I got nothing.

32:51.437 --> 32:52.771
So that rules out
the husband.

32:52.804 --> 32:56.008
The juicy stuff ended up being
from the vehicle.

32:56.042 --> 32:57.176
Exhibit A,

32:57.209 --> 32:59.111
her car key.

32:59.145 --> 33:00.512
It was left in the ignition.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.981
Exhibit B...

33:04.550 --> 33:06.518
...my keys.

33:06.552 --> 33:08.020
Notice a difference?

33:08.054 --> 33:10.056
You're a key hoarder.

33:10.089 --> 33:11.657
Each one of them
has a purpose.

33:11.690 --> 33:15.261
You know? Like your car
and home and office,

33:15.294 --> 33:17.763
church, bike, coffin.

33:17.796 --> 33:19.198
I could go on.

33:19.231 --> 33:22.201
The point is,
no one has just one key.

33:22.234 --> 33:24.136
Killer must've taken it
off the ring.

33:24.170 --> 33:26.538
Which would be
pretty much impossible

33:26.572 --> 33:27.806
if you were wearing gloves.

33:27.839 --> 33:30.676
So, I dusted the key
for prints,

33:30.709 --> 33:33.179
and that is what I'm running
through the system right now.

33:33.212 --> 33:34.713
Okay, how long until...

33:37.216 --> 33:38.650
(beep)
ABBY: Oh!

33:38.684 --> 33:40.519
I'm so good.

33:40.552 --> 33:41.820
Okay.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.689
So, the print belongs to

33:43.722 --> 33:47.193
Petty Officer
Third Class Joe Smiddy,

33:47.226 --> 33:49.695
and he is on board
the USS Ewing.

33:49.728 --> 33:51.163
Isn't that...
That's the same ship

33:51.197 --> 33:52.698
that Bishop
and Torres are on.

33:52.731 --> 33:54.300
They're on board
with the murderer,

33:54.333 --> 33:55.767
and they don't know it.

33:55.801 --> 33:57.669
What are you waiting for,
McGee? Call them.

33:57.703 --> 33:58.737
I can't.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.839
The hurricane has knocked out
all the ship's comms.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.674
And with no answer
on the sat phone,

34:02.708 --> 34:04.276
I can't get in contact
with anyone

34:04.310 --> 34:05.744
until the storm blows over.

34:07.213 --> 34:09.181
That could... be hours.

34:09.215 --> 34:10.749
That could be days.

34:23.229 --> 34:24.830
(thunder rumbling)

34:24.863 --> 34:26.865
Still no answer
from the USS Ewing.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.667
Sat phone signal's strong,
but no one's responding.

34:28.700 --> 34:30.736
Call base ops.
We're flying out there.

34:30.769 --> 34:33.205
The storm's starting to pass,
but, boss, we can't.

34:33.239 --> 34:34.873
Air traffic's grounded.
No one's getting on board

34:34.906 --> 34:35.807
until it's moved
farther away.

34:35.841 --> 34:37.809
Well, that's just
not good enough, McGee.

34:37.843 --> 34:40.112
I know. So I think
I figured out a way

34:40.146 --> 34:41.713
to get word
to Bishop and Torres.

34:41.747 --> 34:42.814
The zombiepocalypse.

34:42.848 --> 34:44.316
What is that?

34:44.350 --> 34:45.617
It's a survival kit

34:45.651 --> 34:47.286
that Abby packed in our go bags.

34:47.319 --> 34:48.587
Each one contains a beeper.

34:48.620 --> 34:49.855
Now, beepers work
off satellites.

34:49.888 --> 34:52.691
Don't know if they're powered on
or not, but it's worth a try.

34:52.724 --> 34:54.793
Yeah, go, go.

34:54.826 --> 34:57.229
Hey, Buckner, have you
seen the sat phone?

34:57.263 --> 34:59.765
Torres and I have been
looking for it everywhere.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.235
Buckner?

35:03.269 --> 35:05.737
Uh...
(clears throat)

35:05.771 --> 35:08.140
No, I, uh...
I haven't seen it.

35:08.174 --> 35:10.609
You okay?

35:10.642 --> 35:11.743
(sighs)

35:11.777 --> 35:13.879
You seriously just ask me that?

35:14.880 --> 35:17.783
Look, I'm...

35:17.816 --> 35:20.852
I'm sorry for how I broke
the news about Helen.

35:20.886 --> 35:23.389
I know it was harsh,
but I just...

35:23.422 --> 35:26.158
I had to see
if you were telling the truth.

35:28.660 --> 35:31.663
I trained for a lot of things.

35:31.697 --> 35:34.233
This was not one of 'em.

35:34.266 --> 35:37.236
Death is... never easy.

35:37.269 --> 35:38.604
Death is one thing,

35:38.637 --> 35:42.408
murder is... quite another.

35:42.441 --> 35:46.178
How do you let that
go and move on?

35:46.212 --> 35:47.913
(sighs)

35:49.348 --> 35:51.883
I had a...

35:51.917 --> 35:55.687
a friend who was killed
a few months back.

35:55.721 --> 35:59.225
And, uh... getting
through it wasn't easy.

35:59.258 --> 36:01.327
Force yourself
to get up in the morning,

36:01.360 --> 36:03.429
get through the day, and...

36:03.462 --> 36:07.733
eventually, life starts
to suck a little less.

36:09.735 --> 36:11.370
You know, I miss being a kid

36:11.403 --> 36:15.207
and not knowing how screwed up
the world really is.

36:15.241 --> 36:17.843
Yep, there is a lot of bad
out there.

36:17.876 --> 36:20.312
It's why I do what I do.

36:20.346 --> 36:25.351
I wanted to be a part
of making things right.

36:25.384 --> 36:28.687
Sounds like why I joined
the military.

36:29.888 --> 36:31.357
You know, I-I
don't blame you

36:31.390 --> 36:34.326
for holding a grudge.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.895
I was an ass
in high school.

36:38.964 --> 36:41.700
You know, the truth is,
you, uh...

36:41.733 --> 36:44.236
you always kind of
intimidated me.

36:46.305 --> 36:47.939
Still do.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.743
Bishop. Just got
word from McGee.

36:51.777 --> 36:52.944
You found
the sat phone?

36:52.978 --> 36:55.314
(beep)
No, he sent a message on this.

36:55.347 --> 36:56.181
Hmm.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.784
They found Petty
Officer Smiddy's print

36:58.817 --> 36:59.618
at the crime scene.

36:59.651 --> 37:02.488
Smiddy?
That doesn't make any sense.

37:02.521 --> 37:04.456
He's an engineer. He hardly had
any contact with Helen.

37:04.490 --> 37:07.025
Why-why would he
want to kill her?

37:07.058 --> 37:08.794
Well, let's find him and ask.

37:08.827 --> 37:12.331
Wait, why would Smiddy come
to the ship after killing Helen?

37:12.364 --> 37:14.266
There has to be
a reason.

37:14.300 --> 37:15.867
I mean, he must be after
something on board.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.869
You said Helen
was one of two people

37:17.903 --> 37:20.372
who had the keys
to the disbursing office.

37:20.406 --> 37:23.475
What if this was about getting
access to the ship's safe?

37:23.509 --> 37:25.677
Yeah, and with a skeleton crew
on board,

37:25.711 --> 37:26.912
that's fewer witnesses.

37:26.945 --> 37:28.380
How much money's in there?

37:28.414 --> 37:30.048
Pre-deployment?

37:30.081 --> 37:32.418
Close to $300,000.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.499
I was just, uh...

37:47.533 --> 37:49.335
What, sleepwalking?

37:50.436 --> 37:51.903
Drop that.

37:54.005 --> 37:56.041
Should've stuck
with robbery, Smiddy.

37:56.074 --> 37:57.909
You'd be looking at 15 years
in prison

37:57.943 --> 38:00.312
instead of a life sentence
for Helen Wynn's murder.

38:00.346 --> 38:02.080
Whoa, I didn't kill anybody.
(handcuffs click)

38:02.113 --> 38:04.082
Okay, my job was just
to break into the safe

38:04.115 --> 38:05.417
and get the money--
that's it.

38:05.451 --> 38:06.952
Then how did Helen end up dead?

38:06.985 --> 38:08.920
I don't know.

38:08.954 --> 38:10.922
M-My buddy's the one who planned
this whole thing, okay?

38:10.956 --> 38:12.558
He was supposed to hold
Lieutenant Wynn

38:12.591 --> 38:14.426
until I got back with
the cash, and then,

38:14.460 --> 38:16.562
once we got out of town,
he was gonna call the cops

38:16.595 --> 38:17.829
and tell them where she was.

38:17.863 --> 38:19.998
He promised me
no one would get hurt.

38:20.031 --> 38:21.433
He lied.

38:21.467 --> 38:23.034
Does your friend have a name?

38:26.472 --> 38:28.474
(helicopter blades whirring)

38:30.008 --> 38:31.810
(grunts)

38:31.843 --> 38:33.479
McGEE:
Morning.

38:33.512 --> 38:34.980
Agent McGee.

38:35.013 --> 38:36.582
Much better weather today.

38:36.615 --> 38:38.450
Looks like we're
through the worst of it.

38:38.484 --> 38:40.852
Uh, you're not.

38:40.886 --> 38:41.920
Excuse me?

38:41.953 --> 38:43.589
You were dating Helen Wynn.

38:43.622 --> 38:45.924
(chuckles) We went out
to dinner a couple times

38:45.957 --> 38:47.826
during her separation.

38:47.859 --> 38:48.994
It was no big deal.

38:49.027 --> 38:50.996
Ah, it was more
than that, Greyson.

38:51.029 --> 38:52.931
You were in love with her.

38:52.964 --> 38:55.467
But then she dropped you
and went back to her husband.

38:55.501 --> 38:57.436
You found a way to get even

38:57.469 --> 38:59.771
and make a whole lot of money
in the process.

38:59.805 --> 39:03.041
You didn't anticipate
Helen figuring it out.

39:03.074 --> 39:05.977
That's when you panicked.
That's when you killed her.

39:06.011 --> 39:08.146
Look, I'm not saying
another word without a lawyer.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.081
See, that's the best part,
actually.

39:10.115 --> 39:12.384
We don't need a confession,
'cause Petty Officer Smiddy

39:12.418 --> 39:13.585
already gave you up.

39:13.619 --> 39:15.153
And there's
the killer's DNA

39:15.186 --> 39:17.389
that we found
underneath Helen's fingernails.

39:17.423 --> 39:21.059
You want to bet that
that matches yours?

39:22.961 --> 39:25.831
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

39:25.864 --> 39:27.899
Helo's fueled and ready.
You're good to go.

39:27.933 --> 39:28.900
All right, thanks.

39:28.934 --> 39:30.936
Let's go.

39:33.939 --> 39:36.174
Hey, uh, thanks again
for your help.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.009
I should be thanking you.

39:38.043 --> 39:40.145
You guys got Helen justice.

39:40.178 --> 39:42.147
I'm extremely grateful for that.

39:42.180 --> 39:46.184
Well, she was lucky
to have you looking out for her.

39:46.217 --> 39:48.854
Yeah, well,
I'm not sure it did any good.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.523
Believe me, it did.

39:51.557 --> 39:53.625
(helicopter blades whirring)

39:55.994 --> 39:59.965
I wish it was under very
different circumstances, but...

39:59.998 --> 40:02.968
I'm glad our paths
crossed again.

40:03.001 --> 40:05.036
You know what, me, too.

40:05.070 --> 40:06.438
(chuckles)

40:07.939 --> 40:10.509
Take care of
yourself, Eleanor.

40:10.542 --> 40:12.478
Keep fighting the good fight.

40:12.511 --> 40:14.580
You, too.

40:20.151 --> 40:22.554
Hey, uh, Thomas.

40:23.622 --> 40:26.458
Drop me a line when you get back
from deployment.

40:26.492 --> 40:28.894
Can grab a coffee, catch up.

40:30.596 --> 40:33.098
Count on it.

40:37.135 --> 40:38.970
(phones ringing)

40:39.004 --> 40:41.473
(elevator bell dings)

40:41.507 --> 40:43.074
Ha.

40:43.108 --> 40:45.143
What were you saying
about coincidences?

40:45.176 --> 40:46.678
(exhales)

40:46.712 --> 40:48.880
I'm not stalking you,
by the way.

40:50.749 --> 40:52.484
Just headed down to the gym.

40:52.518 --> 40:54.085
Care to join me?
No.

40:55.721 --> 40:57.088
Mm-mm.

40:57.122 --> 40:59.124
(chuckles)

41:01.126 --> 41:02.494
(elevator stops)

41:02.528 --> 41:04.496
Something I said?

41:04.530 --> 41:06.264
When I showed up
at your house the other day,

41:06.297 --> 41:08.166
you knew who I was
the whole time, didn't you?

41:08.199 --> 41:09.167
Not the whole time.

41:09.200 --> 41:10.502
How long did it take?

41:10.536 --> 41:12.070
About 30 seconds.
Ouch.

41:12.103 --> 41:13.605
What gave me away?

41:13.639 --> 41:17.075
Flashed your license
like a cop does a badge.

41:17.108 --> 41:18.977
Mm.

41:19.010 --> 41:20.211
(elevator starts)

41:20.245 --> 41:22.614
And Ducky mentioned there was
a new forensic psychologist

41:22.648 --> 41:24.282
coming in from California.

41:24.315 --> 41:26.284
So why didn't you
call me out right then?

41:26.317 --> 41:29.688
I wanted to know what
kind of person you are.

41:29.721 --> 41:31.723
Gonna take you a long time
to figure that out.

41:31.757 --> 41:32.924
Yeah. We'll see.

41:32.958 --> 41:35.026
We'll see.
(elevator bell dings)

41:35.060 --> 41:36.027
(doors open)

41:36.061 --> 41:37.696
Special Agent Sloane.

41:37.729 --> 41:40.566
Special Agent Gibbs.

41:40.599 --> 41:43.769
* I'll smile, I know what
it takes to fool this town *

41:43.802 --> 41:46.938
* I'll do it
till the sun goes down *

41:46.972 --> 41:49.240
* And all through
the nighttime *

41:49.274 --> 41:51.710
* Oh, yeah

41:51.743 --> 41:55.046
* Oh, yeah, I'll tell you
what you want to hear *

41:55.080 --> 41:57.716
* Keep my sunglasses on
while I shed a tear *

41:57.749 --> 42:00.786
* It's never the right time

42:00.819 --> 42:02.788
* Yeah, yeah

42:02.821 --> 42:05.190
* I'll put my armor on

42:05.223 --> 42:07.559
* Show you how strong I am

42:07.593 --> 42:10.095
* I'll put my armor on

42:10.128 --> 42:13.732
* I'll show you that I am

42:13.765 --> 42:16.167
* I'm unstoppable

42:16.201 --> 42:19.638
* I'm a Porsche with no brakes

42:19.671 --> 42:22.173
* I'm invincible

42:22.207 --> 42:25.010
* Yeah, I win
every single game *

42:25.043 --> 42:27.713
* I'm so powerful

42:27.746 --> 42:30.281
* I don't need batteries
to play *

42:30.315 --> 42:33.251
* I'm so confident

42:33.284 --> 42:36.622
* I'm unstoppable today

42:36.655 --> 42:38.590
* Unstoppable today

42:39.691 --> 42:41.827
* Unstoppable today

42:41.860 --> 42:44.362
* Unstoppable today

42:44.395 --> 42:46.231
* I'm unstoppable today.
