WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:04.238
("Kickstart My Heart"
by Mötley Crüe playing)

00:04.272 --> 00:06.006
(train horn blaring)

00:10.078 --> 00:11.745
All right, listen up.
My CI says

00:11.779 --> 00:14.115
the heroin drop
happened last night.

00:14.148 --> 00:17.051
Supplier rented an Airbnb
to cut and package it.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.486
Three, maybe four guards.
Be ready for surprises.

00:18.519 --> 00:19.687
Venice Beach.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.389
Gentrified.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.124
Houses stacked like Legos.
No breathing room for us.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.626
Or mistakes. Day raid.
People everywhere.

00:25.659 --> 00:28.196
SWAT's about saving lives,
not kicking ass.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.164
* When I get high,
I get high on speed... *

00:30.198 --> 00:31.632
What? Nobody thinks I listen?

00:31.665 --> 00:33.167
Hey, rook. You haven't been
around long enough

00:33.201 --> 00:35.503
to quote Scripture.
(chuckles)

00:35.536 --> 00:38.139
* Kick-start my heart

00:38.172 --> 00:40.174
* Always got the cops
coming after me... *

00:40.208 --> 00:42.576
Check it out.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.312
Not again.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.447
Found Luca on the couch
in HQ this morning.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.682
All his stuff with him.

00:48.716 --> 00:51.185
We shut this drug op down, then
we deal with Sleeping Beauty.

00:51.219 --> 00:53.121
Here we go!
Fill the gaps. Stay liquid.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.755
Fill the gaps! Stay liquid!

00:54.788 --> 00:57.191
* Whoa, yeah
(tires screech)

00:57.225 --> 00:59.693
* Kick-start my heart,
give it a start *

00:59.727 --> 01:02.530
* Whoa, yeah

01:02.563 --> 01:05.366
* Baby...

01:05.399 --> 01:07.335
Go, go.

01:07.368 --> 01:08.736
* Kick-start my heart

01:08.769 --> 01:10.538
* Hope it never stops

01:10.571 --> 01:13.274
* Whoa, yeah

01:13.307 --> 01:14.475
* Baby

01:15.709 --> 01:17.711
* Yeah

01:19.413 --> 01:21.615
TAN (over radio):
Position one. Set.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.151
Two. Set.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.352
HONDO:
On three.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.387
One, two, three.
(thuds)

01:31.592 --> 01:33.827
* My heart, my heart

01:33.861 --> 01:36.597
* Kick-start my heart

01:36.630 --> 01:38.532
* Say I got trouble

01:38.566 --> 01:39.633
* Trouble in my eyes...

01:40.301 --> 01:41.502
DEACON:
Gun!

01:43.337 --> 01:44.438
Go, go, go, go!

01:44.472 --> 01:45.806
* Kick-start my heart

01:48.276 --> 01:50.844
* Yeah, are you ready, girls?

01:50.878 --> 01:52.713
* Yeah, are you ready
now, now, now? *

01:52.746 --> 01:56.317
* Whoa, yeah

01:56.350 --> 01:58.386
* Kick-start my heart,
give it a start *

01:58.419 --> 02:01.189
* Whoa, yeah

02:01.222 --> 02:04.358
* Baby

02:04.392 --> 02:06.294
* Whoa, yeah

02:06.327 --> 02:07.661
* Baby...

02:07.695 --> 02:09.463
Luca, initiate!

02:09.497 --> 02:11.399
* Whoa, yeah
HONDO: Go!

02:11.432 --> 02:14.668
* Kick-start my heart,
hope it never stops *

02:14.702 --> 02:16.670
* Whoa, yeah

02:16.704 --> 02:18.572
(shouts)

02:18.606 --> 02:21.309
Deacon, go!
(grunts)

02:21.342 --> 02:22.710
(high-pitched ringing)

02:22.743 --> 02:24.478
Suspect down!

02:29.417 --> 02:32.320
STREET:
Stop! LAPD!

02:32.353 --> 02:35.756
* Skydive naked
from an aeroplane *

02:35.789 --> 02:37.891
* Or a lady with a body
from outer space *

02:37.925 --> 02:39.860
* My heart

02:39.893 --> 02:42.730
* My heart,
kick-start my heart *

02:42.763 --> 02:44.665
(screaming)
* Say I got trouble

02:44.698 --> 02:46.334
* Trouble in my eyes

02:46.367 --> 02:47.701
(gunfire)
* I'm just looking

02:47.735 --> 02:49.370
* For another good time

02:49.403 --> 02:51.505
* My heart, my heart

02:51.539 --> 02:53.441
Cover them. I got him!

02:55.609 --> 02:56.977
* Yeah, are you ready, girls?

02:57.010 --> 02:59.380
(screaming)

02:59.413 --> 03:01.382
* Are you ready now, now, now?

03:01.415 --> 03:03.517
* Whoa, yeah

03:03.551 --> 03:04.818
No, stay.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.787
(grunting)

03:06.820 --> 03:08.422
* Yeah

03:08.456 --> 03:09.857
(gasps)
* Baby...

03:11.459 --> 03:13.327
Stay!

03:13.361 --> 03:14.828
(grunting)

03:14.862 --> 03:17.598
Chris hooked the rabbit.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.867
(panting)

03:23.971 --> 03:25.339
There's no sign of the "H."

03:25.373 --> 03:26.974
You sure your CI's reliable?

03:27.007 --> 03:28.842
(coughing in distance)

03:28.876 --> 03:29.843
(clattering)

03:32.313 --> 03:34.248
(indistinct chatter in distance)

03:48.829 --> 03:50.931
(gasping)

03:50.964 --> 03:52.666
(coughing)

03:53.734 --> 03:55.736
Take it easy, you're safe.

03:55.769 --> 03:56.970
I promise you, you're safe.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.807
(speaking Tagalog)

03:59.840 --> 04:01.542
He's speaking Tagalog.
There are a couple

04:01.575 --> 04:02.643
Filipino families
in my church.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.478
Sir, you speak English?

04:04.512 --> 04:06.547
What's your name?

04:06.580 --> 04:08.349
Javier.

04:08.382 --> 04:09.750
Javier, are there
any drugs in this house?

04:09.783 --> 04:12.353
No.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.656
Are you and your friends okay?
Your lips look...

04:15.689 --> 04:17.691
We don't want trouble...

04:17.725 --> 04:19.327
(groaning)

04:23.364 --> 04:24.398
HONDO:
Med pack!

04:24.432 --> 04:25.799
Man down!

04:25.833 --> 04:27.601
We need paramedics
at the Venice op now!

04:27.635 --> 04:29.403
HONDO: Deac, we're gonna
need more than one bus.

04:29.437 --> 04:32.573
They got heroin inside of them.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.774
Any second, they could
all end up like him.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.009
Sir, stay with me.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.010
Stay with me.
It's okay.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.380
Come on, now.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.548
LUCA:
It's okay.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.284
*

05:18.952 --> 05:20.053
How's he Doing?

05:20.087 --> 05:21.655
Javier is unconscious
but stable.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.357
We're observing
the others.

05:23.391 --> 05:24.925
Any we can talk to, Doc?
I'd rather you wait

05:24.958 --> 05:26.560
until the drugs pass.

05:26.594 --> 05:27.728
I need them calm,
not agitated.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.897
Even then,
it's not a great idea.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.032
Hondo, Captain Cortez,
this is Father Guzman.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.734
One of my staff
called him.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.736
Let you know when I have
an update on Javier.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.104
Thanks, Doc.

05:37.137 --> 05:38.906
What's your interest here,
Father?

05:38.939 --> 05:41.409
These people are my pamilya.
My family.

05:41.442 --> 05:42.876
Nothing's more important.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.412
I run the rescue mission

05:44.445 --> 05:46.013
at Trinity Fellowship
in Filipinotown.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.948
Immigrants don't always
understand their rights,

05:47.981 --> 05:49.983
get taken advantage of.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.852
I make it my business
to help them.

05:51.885 --> 05:54.021
They won't talk
to police.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.155
Are they scared to be deported?

05:55.188 --> 05:56.524
They're here legally,

05:56.557 --> 05:57.591
as licensed nurses.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.560
Then why won't they talk to us?

05:59.593 --> 06:01.061
The situation
in the Philippines.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.630
The police there...

06:02.663 --> 06:04.131
People are dying.

06:04.164 --> 06:04.832
Or they paid for their trip here

06:04.865 --> 06:06.900
by swallowing bags of heroin.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.135
Someone forced them.

06:08.168 --> 06:09.637
Either way, the traffickers
need to go down.

06:09.670 --> 06:10.638
These people can help us.

06:10.671 --> 06:11.939
That's your job.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.407
They don't have
to help you do it.

06:13.441 --> 06:15.008
And that's your call?

06:15.042 --> 06:17.778
Sometimes you have to help those
who can't help themselves.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.913
All right, Father.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.616
We'll be back later when they're
healthy enough to talk.

06:22.650 --> 06:24.485
They can be friendly witnesses

06:24.518 --> 06:25.786
or they can be charged
as drug smugglers.

06:27.555 --> 06:28.689
I'll let you
explain that to them.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.066
What's the word on Javier?

06:39.099 --> 06:40.668
He's gonna make it.
The others, too.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.636
Man, locking people
up like that...

06:42.670 --> 06:44.204
Holding them till
they pass the drugs.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.673
Takes a certain
kind of animal.

06:45.706 --> 06:46.707
HONDO:
It's not the first time.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.542
Won't be the last.
Detective Marcus

06:48.576 --> 06:49.743
wants to talk to you
about this case.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.044
From Homicide?

06:51.078 --> 06:52.680
I haven't seen him

06:52.713 --> 06:54.081
since that task force
in Pico-Union last year.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.649
(phone buzzing)
What's he into

06:55.683 --> 06:57.785
that's got to do with this?
I'm not sure.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.086
You gonna get
that, champ?

07:00.954 --> 07:02.089
One sec.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.826
One of the girls from the roof?

07:05.859 --> 07:07.461
Nah, they were staring at me.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.598
FEMALE VOICE:
An inmate from

07:10.631 --> 07:11.999
a Los Angeles County
Correctional Facility...

07:12.032 --> 07:13.000
KAREN:
Karen Street.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.068
...is attempting to contact you.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.570
Will you accept this call?

07:16.604 --> 07:17.571
Yes.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.776
KAREN:
Jimmy, baby.

07:22.810 --> 07:23.911
Hey, Mom.

07:29.917 --> 07:33.020
Hondo. Congrats on
the cush promotion.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.955
(sighs) What do
you need, Marcus?

07:34.988 --> 07:36.957
Homicide found
three gutted Filipinos

07:36.990 --> 07:38.225
over the last couple of months.

07:38.258 --> 07:41.128
SLUGS thinks it was
some sicko, but now

07:41.161 --> 07:43.531
I'm thinking it's connected
to the mules you found.

07:43.564 --> 07:46.266
Hoping your loser could
tell us something.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.903
The guard you guys caught,
Viper Estes,

07:49.937 --> 07:51.505
lawyered up before he could hit
the holding cell's bidet.

07:51.539 --> 07:53.507
Lawyer's no pushover.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.008
Nice suit.
Yeah.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.577
He'll keep his client quiet.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.211
Our victims aren't talking,
either.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.514
Heard you guys met
Father Guzman.

08:00.548 --> 08:01.982
Spoke with
him, too.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.751
He used to be a Sandista.

08:03.784 --> 08:06.053
Brother got killed by a cop,
or something like that.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.521
Think he's involved?

08:07.555 --> 08:09.056
After his gang days,
he found God or whatever.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.524
So, maybe.

08:10.558 --> 08:11.559
Any leads?

08:11.592 --> 08:12.726
Your mules,

08:12.760 --> 08:14.562
my dead bodies,

08:14.595 --> 08:16.630
were all Filipino nurses
here legally.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.566
Only, yours were lucky
you found them first.

08:18.599 --> 08:21.068
Mine...
I think

08:21.101 --> 08:23.737
they were murdered because
they couldn't pass the heroin,

08:23.771 --> 08:25.839
or maybe the bad guys
just got impatient

08:25.873 --> 08:27.240
and cut it out of 'em.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.310
I hate people.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.646
Where do you want to start?

08:32.680 --> 08:34.314
If you're an immigrant
and want to work legally

08:34.347 --> 08:36.516
in this country,
you need a sponsor.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.690
(indistinct chatter)

08:42.723 --> 08:44.257
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

08:48.128 --> 08:49.229
Hi, Jimmy.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.664
Hey.

08:50.698 --> 08:51.732
Oh...

08:54.602 --> 08:56.303
I hope I didn't
cause you

08:56.336 --> 08:58.271
any trouble with
your new job.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.873
No, no, no.
It's fine.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.642
(clears throat) I mean,
we're on something.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.043
I-I, uh, I got
to be back soon.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.177
Mm.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.579
It's good to see you.

09:05.613 --> 09:06.980
It always is.

09:07.014 --> 09:07.981
You, too.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.787
New paint?

09:13.821 --> 09:15.188
Uh, yeah.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.590
Some shrink told the warden

09:16.624 --> 09:17.991
lime green is soothing.
(chuckles)

09:18.025 --> 09:19.627
What is he,
in therapy?

09:19.660 --> 09:21.695
(chuckles)
He should be.

09:21.729 --> 09:22.930
He's a little bit uptight.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.898
(both chuckle)

09:31.672 --> 09:32.773
Oh, honey.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.642
It's okay.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.276
A few more months,
it'll all be over.

09:36.309 --> 09:37.678
You shouldn't be here.

09:37.711 --> 09:38.879
(sighs)

09:38.912 --> 09:40.681
Always looking out for me.

09:40.714 --> 09:43.617
Even with your father,
you never would back down.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.853
I don't know where you got that.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.821
Not from him.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.760
You remember the time
he came home drunk

09:52.793 --> 09:55.128
and started chasing me
around with a hammer?

09:57.030 --> 09:59.332
You were right there.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.336
But he can't hurt us anymore,
can he?

10:03.370 --> 10:06.774
We just have to keep
moving forward.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.208
Um... (clears throat)

10:08.241 --> 10:10.844
...when you called,
you said it was urgent.

10:10.878 --> 10:14.047
Ye... Um.

10:14.081 --> 10:15.749
A friend of mine,

10:15.783 --> 10:18.285
Diedra Caldwell,
she's getting out next week.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.923
Her ex is a hitter
like your dad was.

10:22.956 --> 10:27.761
I just, I don't want to see
her end up like me or worse.

10:27.795 --> 10:32.165
Look, maybe if her ex
sees that you're a cop...

10:32.199 --> 10:35.368
I mean...

10:35.402 --> 10:37.705
I mean, if you could
just warn him,

10:37.738 --> 10:39.973
tell him to stay away from her
for good,

10:40.007 --> 10:42.342
you know?

10:44.244 --> 10:45.679
Is it wrong?

10:45.713 --> 10:48.115
(sighs)
Nope.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.449
Maybe it is.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.151
It is, it's-it's
wrong to ask you.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.353
I shouldn't have called.

10:53.386 --> 10:56.089
I have no place asking you
for anything.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.825
You got every place to ask me
whatever you want.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.895
Jimmy, you don't owe me
anything.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.797
I owe you everything.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.265
I chose

11:05.298 --> 11:07.300
to stay with your father
when things got ugly.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.703
And you made the right choice
in taking him out.

11:11.872 --> 11:14.374
I don't know.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.476
It was so long ago.
Mom.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.312
Listen to me.

11:19.346 --> 11:23.350
No one was there for us.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.218
Neighbors, teachers,
the mailman--

11:25.252 --> 11:28.088
everybody turned their backs.
Everybody looked the other way.

11:28.121 --> 11:31.024
We were alone.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.193
You did what was necessary.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.999
Okay?

11:42.435 --> 11:44.171
What's this guy's name?

11:44.204 --> 11:46.807
Baby, listen to me...

11:46.840 --> 11:48.708
What's his name?

11:50.310 --> 11:51.178
LUCA:
Look, guys,

11:51.211 --> 11:52.345
you know how it goes.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.246
I need a place to stay tonight.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.748
So cut the suspense,

11:54.782 --> 11:56.149
tell me whose car
to throw my stuff in.

11:56.183 --> 11:57.350
Not me. Sorry, Luca.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.119
I took him last time. Deac?

11:59.152 --> 12:00.788
No way. New baby.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.089
End of story.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.924
What's going on?

12:03.957 --> 12:05.125
CHRIS:
Luca got kicked out

12:05.158 --> 12:06.393
of his apartment
by his girlfriend.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.394
That's three in as many years.
LUCA:
Yeah.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.196
Rule is: someone from the team
has to take me in.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.231
Till he gets on his feet.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.166
What is that?
Like, some kind of Bro Code?

12:13.200 --> 12:15.135
No, SWAT Code. Far more sacred.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.037
Wait, wait, wait.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.973
So, you break up, and the
girls get your apartment?

12:20.007 --> 12:21.942
You need a new lawyer.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.476
Look, Street.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.545
I'm a good guy, all right?
And I always warn them

12:25.578 --> 12:27.547
at the beginning, "If you
expect me to settle down,

12:27.580 --> 12:29.817
forget it.
I'm married to SWAT."

12:29.850 --> 12:31.819
They just never believe me.
That's hard-core, Luca.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.353
Well, it's in my DNA.
Three generations:

12:33.386 --> 12:34.788
my grandpops, my pops and me.

12:34.822 --> 12:36.556
Kind of a holy trinity.
And just as badass.

12:36.589 --> 12:37.825
(imitates explosion)

12:37.858 --> 12:38.859
All right, listen up.

12:38.892 --> 12:41.328
Cortez's INS contact
ID'd the nurses' sponsor.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.395
Robert Miller.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.396
What's the business?

12:43.430 --> 12:44.965
HONDO:
Employment agency.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.299
Recruits workers for
nursing homes around town.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.500
That's a good cover.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.102
Deac, Luca, Tan,

12:49.136 --> 12:50.370
you're with me on
the corporate office.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.105
What about us?

12:52.139 --> 12:53.874
Marcus is bringing
some nursing home employees

12:53.907 --> 12:55.142
and residents here.
He needs help interviewing them.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.477
That'll work.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.379
*

12:59.412 --> 13:01.014
DEACON:
Maybe you can explain it to us,

13:01.048 --> 13:02.515
Mr. Miller.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.284
I run an employment agency
in Santa Clarita.

13:04.317 --> 13:05.485
Not some drug operation.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.087
Sir, nurses
you sponsored

13:07.120 --> 13:09.122
from the Philippines
were used as drug mules

13:09.156 --> 13:10.323
and held prisoner.

13:10.357 --> 13:13.026
A few of them have died.

13:13.060 --> 13:15.128
I had no idea.

13:15.162 --> 13:17.164
That's horrible.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.833
Uh, look, my wife is Filipino.

13:19.867 --> 13:21.234
It's a travesty
what's happening--

13:21.268 --> 13:22.569
all the violence there.

13:22.602 --> 13:23.636
(stammers)
The people are desperate.

13:23.670 --> 13:26.840
I'm just trying to help
as many of them as I can.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.475
By finding them work
in nursing homes?
Yes.

13:28.508 --> 13:31.144
I work with Filipino
nursing schools to find people

13:31.178 --> 13:33.480
who are willing to care
for our aging population.

13:33.513 --> 13:36.216
There's not a lot of people here
who want to clean bedpans.

13:36.249 --> 13:37.985
For a green card, they'll do it.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.386
HONDO: When you bring
them over, what happens?

13:39.419 --> 13:40.453
You pick them up
from the airport,

13:40.487 --> 13:41.621
you find them housing, what?

13:41.654 --> 13:43.190
No, see,
I'm-I'm just the middleman.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.591
I-I file the permits,
I do the paperwork.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.393
I never even meet them
face-to-face.

13:46.426 --> 13:47.995
Who does?

13:48.028 --> 13:51.865
I hired this guy about
a year ago, a recruiter.

13:51.899 --> 13:54.935
He speaks fluent Tagalog,
and he's cheap.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.637
He's the one who manages
the nurses when they get here.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.140
His name is Julio Arvado.

14:05.512 --> 14:08.015
(locking bar clatters)

14:09.149 --> 14:10.183
Julio Arvado?

14:14.354 --> 14:16.389
Clear.

14:16.423 --> 14:17.557
No sign of him, boss.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.894
Got something.

14:20.928 --> 14:22.129
Condom balloons and duct tape.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.197
All the tools.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.233
Well, he didn't try very hard
to hide the merchandise.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.334
All right, Tan,
take pics, document it,

14:27.367 --> 14:28.535
but leave it all here.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.670
Yeah, don't want
to spook this guy.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.272
HONDO:
Let's figure out where he is.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.406
(camera snaps)

14:33.440 --> 14:35.208
TAN:
Luca, we catch Arvado,

14:35.242 --> 14:37.911
this place will have a vacancy.

14:37.945 --> 14:40.513
Oh, yeah, sure.
I've always wanted hep C.

14:40.547 --> 14:41.681
Admit it, Luca.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.283
You're a terrible houseguest.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.285
What are you talking about,
Deac? Your kids love me.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.686
Yeah, well, you kept my son up
all night playing video games.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.555
He slept through school
the next day.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.223
TAN:
You ran up my Pink Dot bill.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.392
Yeah, and Chris says that you
ate everything in her fridge.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.962
Boss?
HONDO:
No way, Luca. You're like

14:54.995 --> 14:57.264
a frat boy his first day away
from home; I need sleep.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.933
Okay, my brothers.
There are SWAT rules passed down

14:59.967 --> 15:02.002
from generation
to generation.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.370
No officer left behind.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.472
So I have faith
that one of you

15:05.505 --> 15:06.639
will come through for me
before tonight.

15:06.673 --> 15:09.442
(knocking)

15:15.382 --> 15:16.416
(knocking continues)

15:17.617 --> 15:19.119
Arvado, man, it's Ross.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.420
Open up.

15:20.453 --> 15:23.923
(knocking)

15:30.397 --> 15:31.965
Arvado's not here.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.200
Where is he?

15:33.233 --> 15:35.468
HONDO:
What do you need?

15:35.502 --> 15:37.337
ROSS:
Something good.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.172
How much you got?

15:39.206 --> 15:40.573
20 bucks for a couple of bags.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.610
(both chuckle)

15:49.282 --> 15:50.383
Come on in, man.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.425
I'm on a bad trip.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.460
No, you're good.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.597
It's nice to
meet you, Ross,

16:04.631 --> 16:07.400
uh, Martin.

16:07.434 --> 16:10.503
Tell us all about Julio Arvado.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.539
CHRIS: He's got a couple
old arrests for possession.

16:12.572 --> 16:13.640
MARCUS:
Hey, send me that.

16:13.673 --> 16:16.276
I'm talking to a nurse manager
at one of the homes.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.744
I'll see if she recognizes him.

16:17.777 --> 16:20.380
Mm-hmm.
Meanwhile, you two
can handle him.

16:20.413 --> 16:23.583
Retiree, James Traylor.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.718
Insisted on coming
with said manager.
Hmm.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.427
Quit flirting.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.663
Ask him out already.
Hey,

16:36.696 --> 16:38.398
you treat 'em like family,
like Hondo says.

16:38.431 --> 16:39.599
Come on.

16:39.632 --> 16:41.334
Sounds like a solo job, right?

16:43.203 --> 16:46.039
Listen, uh,

16:46.073 --> 16:48.641
I need you to cover for me,
just for, like, a half hour.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.577
(laughs):
That's funny.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.312
Let's go.
You're on the clock.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.683
I have an important errand
to run nearby for my mom.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.485
I think you know
her situation, okay?
No.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.420
No. Hey,

17:00.453 --> 17:01.621
absolutely not.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.556
Text me if we're
on the move.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.233
Help you, sir?

17:17.370 --> 17:20.407
Officer James Traylor, LAPD.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.675
Class of '65.

17:22.709 --> 17:23.843
Honor to meet you,
Officer.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.145
You, too.

17:25.178 --> 17:28.415
You know,

17:28.448 --> 17:32.319
we're not the reason all the
nurses at our home are scared.

17:32.352 --> 17:33.753
The police, I mean.
Yeah?

17:33.786 --> 17:35.822
You got some information
for me, Officer?

17:43.396 --> 17:44.331
(knocks)

17:52.705 --> 17:54.241
Trey Smith?

17:54.274 --> 17:57.277
Yeah.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.312
I'm here about Deidra.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.217
What about her?

18:04.251 --> 18:05.818
Need you to stay away from her.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.120
For good.

18:07.154 --> 18:09.822
Understand?

18:09.856 --> 18:12.225
What's SWAT got to do
with any of it?

18:12.259 --> 18:14.261
You hear what I said?

18:15.662 --> 18:19.499
Sure, Officer.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.236
(laughs)

18:23.270 --> 18:24.271
Insurance.
This a game to you?

18:24.304 --> 18:25.505
Business.

18:25.538 --> 18:26.873
Yeah?

18:26.906 --> 18:29.176
You stay out of mine,
I'll stay out of yours.

18:29.209 --> 18:30.910
That what you call what you do
with her? Business?

18:30.943 --> 18:33.713
Well, what do you call it,
tough guy?

18:33.746 --> 18:35.382
You sure you want to talk
to a cop like that?

18:35.415 --> 18:38.518
I don't think you're here
as a cop.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.821
Just stay away from her.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.656
Or what?

18:43.690 --> 18:45.858
Or you'll regret it.
Yeah?

18:45.892 --> 18:46.893
(grunting)

18:50.663 --> 18:52.699
Where can we find Julio Arvado?

18:55.268 --> 18:58.338
Okay. Here's what
we're gonna do, all right?

18:58.371 --> 18:59.839
I-I got to get out of here.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.875
I start work in an hour,
but, um...

19:05.345 --> 19:08.448
Did-did Arvado leave any "H"
lying around here?

19:08.481 --> 19:09.816
Or...?

19:09.849 --> 19:11.418
We're not dealers.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.253
Right, but there's
got to be room...
(phone buzzing)

19:13.286 --> 19:14.687
...for some negotiation here.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.191
Yeah, this is Hondo.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.359
What?

19:22.495 --> 19:23.663
Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

19:23.696 --> 19:24.931
What?

19:24.964 --> 19:27.200
Street just got
himself arrested.

19:27.234 --> 19:29.469
We got this. Go.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.208
(indistinct radio chatter)

19:37.910 --> 19:39.312
Realized he's one
of yours, Hondo.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.613
I thought it best to call.

19:40.647 --> 19:41.814
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.729
So, what are we doing?

19:56.763 --> 19:58.331
You want to press charges?
Make this a thing?

20:02.369 --> 20:04.271
No.

20:04.304 --> 20:05.938
What about you?

20:09.942 --> 20:12.712
Turn around.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.781
(handcuffs loosen)

20:17.016 --> 20:18.485
Get out of here.

20:31.931 --> 20:34.033
HONDO: We are hunting a human
trafficker, a murder suspect,

20:34.066 --> 20:35.668
and you just up
and leave your post?

20:40.573 --> 20:43.843
Street, I have been
giving you rope.

20:43.876 --> 20:46.446
Plenty of it,
because of Buck.

20:46.479 --> 20:47.947
But I'm not doing it anymore.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.285
This has something to do
with the visit to your mom,

20:52.319 --> 20:53.019
doesn't it?

20:56.523 --> 20:59.459
Look at me.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.994
You got to pick one boat.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.262
One boat?

21:03.296 --> 21:06.299
You are a SWAT officer, or you
are a loose cannon, your choice.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.667
Look, it was a
favor to my mom.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.035
It was to protect
a friend of hers.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.303
How was I supposed
to tell her no?

21:15.575 --> 21:16.676
She's on my list now, too,

21:16.709 --> 21:18.845
because of you.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.380
(quietly):
Oh, crap.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.483
I really can't believe

21:23.516 --> 21:24.417
you signed off on this, Chris.

21:24.451 --> 21:25.952
It wasn't her fault.
She tried to stop me.

21:25.985 --> 21:28.621
Oh, so now you want
to be a team player?

21:28.655 --> 21:29.856
CHRIS:
You're right, boss.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.791
I should have
made him stay.

21:31.824 --> 21:34.627
It won't happen again.
I promise.

21:36.996 --> 21:39.499
I found something on
the trafficker, I think.

21:39.532 --> 21:41.568
All right, it'd better
be good enough to get me

21:41.601 --> 21:43.803
out of my bad mood.
What do you got?
Retired LAPD

21:43.836 --> 21:45.705
heard a couple of nurses
talking about Arvado.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.039
He's got something over them.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.775
It's the reason why
they're afraid to talk.

21:48.808 --> 21:49.876
Kept saying "pamilya."

21:49.909 --> 21:52.845
Family.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.547
The traffickers are
threatening your families,

21:54.581 --> 21:55.782
aren't they, Javier?

21:55.815 --> 21:57.684
Is this man-- Julio Arvado--

21:57.717 --> 21:59.786
is this the reason why
you won't talk to us?

21:59.819 --> 22:02.021
Look, if that's true, you can't
help them a world away.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.055
We don't think they're
in the Philippines.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.391
We think they're here.

22:04.424 --> 22:05.792
I called DHS on the way over,

22:05.825 --> 22:06.926
got some names
from the flight manifest.

22:06.959 --> 22:11.398
One name is
Paul Sanchez, 19.

22:11.431 --> 22:12.765
Same last name as yours.

22:12.799 --> 22:14.567
Is Paul your son?

22:14.601 --> 22:16.736
No police.

22:18.871 --> 22:20.940
Holding family members is a
common tactic with traffickers.

22:20.973 --> 22:24.477
But if that's what's happened,
you-you can't ask him...

22:24.511 --> 22:26.145
ask any of them to risk
the lives of their loved ones.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.680
We're trying to save
their loved ones.

22:32.752 --> 22:34.387
(sighs)

22:34.421 --> 22:35.354
Father.

22:37.123 --> 22:39.626
Javier is scared.

22:39.659 --> 22:40.860
But you're the one
who doesn't trust us.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.831
I had my reasons
not to trust cops once,

22:44.864 --> 22:46.566
but one did right by me,

22:46.599 --> 22:49.569
changed my view.

22:49.602 --> 22:51.771
Give us a chance.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.148
Javier...

23:02.181 --> 23:05.017
(speaking Tagalog)

23:09.021 --> 23:11.924
(continues in Tagalog)

23:14.861 --> 23:16.796
*

23:23.736 --> 23:24.937
This man,

23:24.971 --> 23:28.441
he divided us up.

23:28.475 --> 23:30.109
Said he would

23:30.142 --> 23:32.712
kill the others if we talked.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.083
Said he would kill my son.

23:45.892 --> 23:48.895
HONDO: There's a second group of
drug mules being held hostage.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.931
Six people.
And we think Arvado has them.

23:51.964 --> 23:54.867
Javier said they started as
one group in the Philippines.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.869
Armed men forced them
to ingest the "H" before

23:56.903 --> 23:58.538
they boarded the
plane to come here.

23:58.571 --> 23:59.839
Yeah, they arrived
a couple days ago,

23:59.872 --> 24:01.874
Arvado splits them
into two groups.

24:01.908 --> 24:03.743
Threatened that if anyone from
one group called the police,

24:03.776 --> 24:05.144
a family member from
the other group would be killed

24:05.177 --> 24:06.579
and vice versa.

24:06.613 --> 24:07.914
Keeps everyone nice
and cooperative.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.081
Don't anyone
from the missing group

24:09.115 --> 24:09.982
to O.D. like Javier.

24:10.016 --> 24:11.918
Yeah, or worse.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.820
What about Robert Miller? Can
we get something else from him?

24:13.853 --> 24:15.555
We're reviewing his financials.

24:15.588 --> 24:17.557
So far, nothing.
We might have something else.

24:17.590 --> 24:19.692
That tweaker
from Arvado's house, Ross,

24:19.726 --> 24:21.661
said that Arvado's got
a girlfriend: Leila Garcia.

24:21.694 --> 24:22.962
Works in Hollywood at Club G.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.096
LUCA:
Yeah, we can talk to her.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.698
HONDO:
Good. Take Street.

24:25.732 --> 24:27.567
Chris, Tan, keep working
the Miller angle.

24:27.600 --> 24:30.169
Let's get him this time.
Let's move.

24:30.202 --> 24:32.204
At least you could have
gotten away with whatever it is

24:32.238 --> 24:34.073
that you were doing.

24:34.106 --> 24:36.843
What? I should see
the other guy?

24:36.876 --> 24:39.211
Hey, what happened to him?

24:41.280 --> 24:44.050
Hondo, I oversee this team.

24:44.083 --> 24:46.285
I'm his direct supervisor.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.955
After the times
I've backed you?

24:48.988 --> 24:51.924
You want to go to the Man
about who's in charge here?

24:51.958 --> 24:54.927
(laughs)
No. No, not here, I don't.

24:54.961 --> 24:57.229
Jess, I get it.

24:57.263 --> 24:58.698
Street is a new SWAT member.

24:58.731 --> 24:59.866
That's time, that's resources.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.701
I get it. Look,

25:01.734 --> 25:02.869
I want to tell you
that the kid's worth it,

25:02.902 --> 25:04.871
I just don't
know right now.

25:04.904 --> 25:07.106
I have no idea what
he's going through.

25:07.139 --> 25:09.041
I could use your
help finding out.

25:10.777 --> 25:13.045
All you had to do was ask.

25:13.079 --> 25:14.246
What do you need?

25:14.280 --> 25:16.082
*

25:16.115 --> 25:17.584
* Hey, chica, hablas mi lengua

25:17.617 --> 25:19.619
* Come here
and do your thing, ma *

25:19.652 --> 25:21.788
* Seen ya chillin' to the beat,
I think... *

25:21.821 --> 25:24.757
Nobody else until
these three.

25:24.791 --> 25:25.958
Ah.

25:25.992 --> 25:28.795
I got this.

25:28.828 --> 25:32.064
Luca, you know better.
This is not the dress code.

25:32.098 --> 25:34.166
Alexander,
L.A.'s personal stylist.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.135
I thought you were still working
over at Cobalt.

25:36.168 --> 25:37.604
Too retro.
Yeah?

25:37.637 --> 25:38.838
And this establishment's
up to code.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.808
This, however, isn't.
(chuckles wryly)

25:41.841 --> 25:43.109
So sad.

25:43.142 --> 25:45.277
Now, you.

25:45.311 --> 25:47.113
You've got potential.

25:47.146 --> 25:49.148
Once whatever this
is clears up.

25:49.181 --> 25:50.750
DEACON: We're looking into
a human trafficking ring.

25:50.783 --> 25:52.318
A guy named Arvado.

25:52.351 --> 25:53.953
We'd like to talk to
his girl Leila.

25:53.986 --> 25:55.922
Ah, she's on her lunch break
in the alley.

25:55.955 --> 25:57.590
All right, thanks, man.

26:01.961 --> 26:03.329
LEILA:
Arvado was in earlier tonight.

26:03.362 --> 26:05.932
He left about two hours ago.

26:05.965 --> 26:07.834
Did he say where
he was going?
Nah.

26:07.867 --> 26:10.703
He just pops in whenever
he's looking to scratch an itch.

26:10.737 --> 26:12.705
LUCA: Listen, this guy
is bad news, okay?

26:12.739 --> 26:14.607
You don't want to be
protecting him.

26:14.641 --> 26:16.208
Maybe I'm protecting myself.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.144
Look, we got a father who's
looking for his kidnapped son.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.146
Arvado knows where he is.

26:20.179 --> 26:23.282
Well, my father was a drunk
who was never around, so...

26:23.315 --> 26:26.686
sorry if I'm
not feeling you.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.657
Arvado used you, too, didn't he?

26:30.690 --> 26:33.325
Hmm?

26:33.359 --> 26:35.061
How old were you?

26:35.094 --> 26:38.197
15? 16?

26:38.230 --> 26:39.932
You supposed to care?

26:39.966 --> 26:42.835
They tell me it's my job.

26:42.869 --> 26:43.602
Messed up job.
Yeah.

26:45.204 --> 26:46.939
Might not have it much longer.
Yeah?

26:46.973 --> 26:47.940
Why is that?

26:47.974 --> 26:49.976
Uh, I, uh, I messed up today.

26:50.009 --> 26:51.377
Pretty bad.

26:53.312 --> 26:56.615
What do you say you help me
go out with a bang? Hmm?

26:58.117 --> 27:00.152
One screwup to another.

27:07.794 --> 27:10.296
Arvado recruited me
when I was 13.

27:11.898 --> 27:13.365
For sex.

27:15.301 --> 27:18.070
Well, now he's making people
smuggle drugs.

27:18.104 --> 27:20.006
We think he's murdered
some of them.

27:24.410 --> 27:25.745
I overheard him earlier today.

27:27.980 --> 27:30.149
He's got a big sale
planned tonight.

27:30.182 --> 27:32.084
Unloading all of his heroin.

27:32.118 --> 27:33.853
That means he's got to go back
to his house to get his stash.

27:33.886 --> 27:34.687
I'll call Hondo.

27:34.721 --> 27:36.789
(quietly): Thank you.

27:46.298 --> 27:47.800
(sighs)

27:47.834 --> 27:49.736
It's been over an hour.

27:49.769 --> 27:51.170
HONDO (over comm):
We play this out.

27:51.203 --> 27:54.440
Arvado's our link to
Javier's son and the others.

27:54.473 --> 27:55.842
Let's get him easy,
let's get him alive.

28:05.251 --> 28:07.019
STREET: Man of the hour.
12 o'clock.

28:07.053 --> 28:09.321
Let's go.

28:22.134 --> 28:23.770
Check him.

28:25.404 --> 28:26.338
Arvado's dead.

28:26.372 --> 28:30.242
(siren wailing)

28:30.276 --> 28:31.443
(motorcycle revving)

28:35.147 --> 28:36.916
(siren chirps)

28:47.293 --> 28:48.194
Where are the hostages?

28:56.102 --> 28:58.037
You get anything
from Arvado's killer?

28:58.070 --> 29:00.539
Murdo Wick,
hit man on the cheap.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.809
Murderer's name is Murdo?

29:02.842 --> 29:04.110
I guess his mama was psychic.

29:04.143 --> 29:06.979
(scoffs)
Lawyered up
like the other guy.

29:07.013 --> 29:08.547
Whoever's running this thing
knows how to cover their tracks.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.850
HONDO:
That takes serious cash.

29:10.883 --> 29:12.785
Yes, it does.

29:12.819 --> 29:13.986
Nice suit.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.454
Just like the other guy.

29:17.056 --> 29:18.224
Okay.

29:18.257 --> 29:19.859
Same A-list law firm.

29:19.892 --> 29:21.961
HONDO: Attorneys for the guy
we grabbed at the drug house

29:21.994 --> 29:23.229
and Arvado's killer?

29:23.262 --> 29:25.397
Question is,
who's paying the bills?

29:25.431 --> 29:28.200
Our middleman
Robert Miller's bank statement.

29:28.234 --> 29:30.837
He paid that firm
a retainer fee.

29:30.870 --> 29:31.838
HONDO:
Arvado was the recruiter,

29:31.871 --> 29:34.040
but Miller was the money.

29:34.073 --> 29:36.042
He used the nurses
as a pipeline for the heroin.

29:36.075 --> 29:37.209
I'll get a warrant.

29:37.243 --> 29:40.046
Hondo, something else.

29:40.079 --> 29:42.381
Trey Smith, the guy Street
got into it with.

29:42.414 --> 29:44.050
Yeah.

29:49.255 --> 29:50.322
You want me to...

29:50.356 --> 29:52.424
No.

29:52.458 --> 29:55.127
No, I'll deal with it.

29:55.161 --> 29:56.996
Why risk your career for him?

29:57.029 --> 30:00.266
(huffs) I've been there, Jess.

30:00.299 --> 30:03.169
Not with SWAT, just...

30:03.202 --> 30:05.404
Things can grab ahold of you

30:05.437 --> 30:08.274
and make you feel like
you can't trust anyone.

30:08.307 --> 30:11.343
Until you learn to again.

30:11.377 --> 30:13.212
I'll let you know
when we get Miller.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.922
Is my husband in some
kind of trouble?

30:22.955 --> 30:24.991
We need to talk to him
about murder, heroin

30:25.024 --> 30:26.058
and human trafficking.

30:26.092 --> 30:27.426
So, maybe.

30:27.459 --> 30:30.196
Is this a joke?

30:30.229 --> 30:31.931
I swear, Mr. Miller isn't here.

30:31.964 --> 30:33.432
Well, where is he, then?

30:33.465 --> 30:37.136
I don't know. He left
a couple of hours ago.

30:37.169 --> 30:40.606
Trust me, I would
never lie to SWAT.

30:40.639 --> 30:43.509
(typing)

30:43.542 --> 30:46.512
You know, you got all the moves
in the field; people like you.

30:46.545 --> 30:49.115
Seriously, if you'd stop
shooting yourself in the foot,

30:49.148 --> 30:50.516
you'd be really good
at all of this.

30:50.549 --> 30:52.251
I know.

30:52.284 --> 30:54.887
At least you're humble.

30:54.921 --> 30:56.088
(scoffs)

30:58.357 --> 31:00.226
Hondo, he's not around.

31:00.259 --> 31:02.194
All right, thanks.

31:02.228 --> 31:03.195
Your husband's not
at the office.

31:03.229 --> 31:04.964
He's not here, either.

31:04.997 --> 31:06.165
Yeah, nothing.
TAN: Nope.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.134
Where is he, ma'am?

31:08.167 --> 31:11.003
This is a mistake.

31:11.037 --> 31:12.404
Robert would never...

31:12.438 --> 31:14.573
He's a good man.

31:14.606 --> 31:17.043
And these things...
a-and to my people.

31:17.076 --> 31:19.611
It's not possible.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.213
His name is Paul.

31:21.247 --> 31:22.348
His father Javier
brought him here

31:22.381 --> 31:24.183
for a better life,
and now he's missing.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.417
Your husband knows where he is.

31:28.420 --> 31:31.157
Robert has a private cell,
just for me.

31:31.190 --> 31:33.259
Why don't I-I just call him?

31:33.292 --> 31:37.363
Show you that you're
wrong about him?

31:37.396 --> 31:38.965
Just ask him where he is.

31:38.998 --> 31:41.467
Put it on speaker.

31:41.500 --> 31:42.634
(line ringing)

31:42.668 --> 31:43.936
ROBERT:
Hello.

31:43.970 --> 31:45.637
Robert?

31:45.671 --> 31:47.539
(speaking Tagalog)

31:47.573 --> 31:49.075
English, Mrs. Miller.

31:49.108 --> 31:51.577
At the country club.

31:51.610 --> 31:54.646
Uh, sorry.
Y-You're breaking up. Where?

31:54.680 --> 31:57.383
The country club.
Drinks with some investors.

31:57.416 --> 31:58.684
Thought I told you.
Okay.

31:58.717 --> 32:00.419
I'll see you when you get home.

32:00.452 --> 32:01.620
I love you.

32:01.653 --> 32:03.355
Love you, too. See you soon.

32:03.389 --> 32:04.991
What's the name of the club?

32:05.024 --> 32:06.692
Valencia.
Let's go.

32:06.725 --> 32:07.994
See, I told you.

32:08.027 --> 32:10.462
This is all just
a big mistake.

32:10.496 --> 32:11.964
My dealer's dead,
I got a bunch of immigrants

32:11.998 --> 32:13.365
with heroin inside 'em,

32:13.399 --> 32:15.134
and I go out for drinks
at a country club?

32:15.167 --> 32:16.335
Miller thinks
he's untouchable.
Also has the means

32:16.368 --> 32:17.536
to hire firepower, a hit man.

32:17.569 --> 32:19.238
We find him, watch yourselves.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.073
Yeah, you don't want to end up
looking like Street.

32:21.107 --> 32:23.242
Can't miss that face.

32:23.275 --> 32:24.376
What happened to him?

32:24.410 --> 32:25.477
He piss off the wrong retiree?

32:26.778 --> 32:28.514
I wish it was that simple.

32:30.182 --> 32:32.018
Your husband's neck deep
in all this.

32:32.051 --> 32:35.021
Why should I believe
you aren't?

32:35.054 --> 32:37.656
Detective, I'm going to
help you with everything.

32:37.689 --> 32:39.358
Can I make us
some coffee, tea?

32:39.391 --> 32:41.127
No, no.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.394
Do you two have
any other properties?

32:42.428 --> 32:44.997
Not that I know of.

32:45.031 --> 32:48.234
Does he have a storage locker,
safety deposit box?

32:48.267 --> 32:50.069
We have a home safe,

32:50.102 --> 32:53.072
uh, for paperwork,
passports.

32:53.105 --> 32:56.475
If there are any other
properties or storage lockers,

32:56.508 --> 32:58.510
the information will be here.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.646
And how much do you two
discuss business?

33:00.679 --> 33:02.581
(Marcus groaning)

33:11.623 --> 33:13.092
Marcus is conscious,
but he's in rough shape.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.693
Paramedics made it in time.
Listen to me,

33:14.726 --> 33:16.095
we need to find out
where the Millers are headed.

33:16.128 --> 33:17.596
We're raking the office.

33:17.629 --> 33:18.797
Come on, now,
we got six missing immigrants.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.266
Our only leads are on the run.

33:20.299 --> 33:21.633
We'll find something.

33:21.667 --> 33:22.668
Check this out.

33:22.701 --> 33:24.270
Hang on.

33:24.303 --> 33:25.804
Numbers, flight coordinates.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.139
Pilot's logs.

33:27.173 --> 33:28.707
Hondo, Miller's a pilot.

33:28.740 --> 33:29.741
Looks like a Cessna.

33:29.775 --> 33:31.310
Want us to alert the airports?

33:31.343 --> 33:32.578
No, wait a minute,
wait a minute, hold on.

33:32.611 --> 33:33.779
When Adele called her husband,

33:33.812 --> 33:35.047
she said something
like "San-see."

33:35.081 --> 33:36.315
So?
San-see.

33:36.348 --> 33:37.783
SAN C.

33:37.816 --> 33:40.286
That's the call tag
for the Santa Clarita Airport.

33:40.319 --> 33:43.189
All right, we're on the move.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.394
Were you followed?
No.

33:48.427 --> 33:49.461
Get in the plane.

33:53.499 --> 33:54.533
Go, go, go!

33:55.634 --> 33:56.535
(tires screech)

34:12.584 --> 34:13.652
(grunts)

34:17.323 --> 34:18.690
Don't do it!

34:41.613 --> 34:44.082
*

34:49.355 --> 34:51.423
(screaming)

34:51.457 --> 34:52.891
Tell me where the
nurses are right now.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.126
Get off me!

34:54.160 --> 34:56.262
Stop! Stop!

34:56.295 --> 34:58.264
I said stop!

34:58.297 --> 35:00.132
(panting)

35:02.401 --> 35:05.804
Robert, don't say anything.

35:05.837 --> 35:06.838
Look, this was
never supposed

35:06.872 --> 35:09.208
to happen, not like this.

35:09.241 --> 35:10.008
You just wanted
to make some easy money.

35:10.041 --> 35:11.777
I-I didn't even have
to be involved.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.645
I just find the nurses jobs,
and Arvado would...

35:13.679 --> 35:16.215
Shut up!

35:16.248 --> 35:17.716
Look, she's the one who
introduced me to him-- Arvado.

35:17.749 --> 35:20.286
You listen to me.

35:20.319 --> 35:22.554
You both are gonna
go down for murder.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.656
Now, here's where you get
to decide who gets it worse.

35:24.690 --> 35:27.459
Where are they?

35:28.527 --> 35:30.796
I'll tell you.

35:31.897 --> 35:34.233
You...

35:40.872 --> 35:42.808
Luca.

35:46.845 --> 35:48.747
(muffled groaning)

35:50.916 --> 35:51.917
Pamilya.

35:53.552 --> 35:54.520
Pamilya.

35:54.553 --> 35:56.255
Pamilya.

35:56.288 --> 35:58.890
You're safe.

35:58.924 --> 36:00.526
Your family is safe.

36:01.927 --> 36:02.794
Get 'em out of here, go, go.

36:13.539 --> 36:15.907
There you go.

36:15.941 --> 36:18.410
I got someone here who's gonna
be really glad to see you.

36:24.516 --> 36:25.917
(speaking Tagalog)

36:36.995 --> 36:38.530
Hey.

36:40.399 --> 36:42.368
Let's get them
some water.

36:46.738 --> 36:48.940
Thank you for finding him.

36:51.510 --> 36:52.511
Be well.

36:54.946 --> 36:56.248
Let me just get
you over here.

36:56.282 --> 36:58.216
I want to get him
checked out, okay?

37:01.720 --> 37:03.689
You changed some minds today.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.857
Sometimes you got to take care

37:05.891 --> 37:06.925
of those who can't take care
of themselves.

37:06.958 --> 37:08.894
All the time.

37:24.710 --> 37:26.645
Okay, all right, thanks.

37:29.515 --> 37:31.483
(sighs)

37:43.929 --> 37:46.698
I don't want
to lose this job.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.036
I'm gonna need to see
some improvement, then.

37:51.069 --> 37:53.004
You will.

37:58.410 --> 37:59.611
I'm not gonna let it go
without punishment.

37:59.645 --> 38:00.812
I know.

38:00.846 --> 38:02.448
What am I looking at?

38:02.481 --> 38:04.450
You got to let Luca
stay with you

38:04.483 --> 38:06.017
until he finds
another place.

38:07.919 --> 38:09.655
That doesn't seem like much
of a punishment.

38:09.688 --> 38:11.723
Trust me, it will.

38:11.757 --> 38:13.725
Oh, there he is now.

38:13.759 --> 38:14.526
(indistinct chatter)

38:14.560 --> 38:15.961
Luca.

38:15.994 --> 38:16.995
Yo, what's up?

38:17.028 --> 38:19.598
You're bunking
at Street's.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.400
Ah, just under
the wire.

38:21.433 --> 38:24.069
I thought I was gonna have
to get a hotel tonight.

38:24.102 --> 38:25.571
I knew you guys
would come through.

38:25.604 --> 38:26.638
Hey, Street, you live
near the beach, right?

38:26.672 --> 38:27.739
Uh...
You got a board?

38:27.773 --> 38:28.940
Uh...
No worries.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.542
I got an extra one.

38:30.576 --> 38:31.943
Best waves are
at 5:00 a.m.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.979
You got Xbox
or PlayStation?

38:34.012 --> 38:35.481
PlayStation.
Beautiful.

38:35.514 --> 38:37.683
You pick the game,
I kick your ass, buddy.

38:37.716 --> 38:40.519
STREET:
We're gonna get some sleep
at some point, right?

38:40.552 --> 38:41.920
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

38:50.729 --> 38:52.998
Who are you?

38:53.031 --> 38:54.900
Name's Hondo.

38:54.933 --> 38:56.067
I work with your son.

38:56.101 --> 38:57.569
Oh, Jimmy?

38:57.603 --> 38:59.471
Mm-hmm.
Is he okay?

38:59.505 --> 39:00.539
He's fine.

39:00.572 --> 39:03.008
(grunts)

39:04.843 --> 39:06.778
Have a seat.

39:10.015 --> 39:12.718
Um, is he working out?

39:12.751 --> 39:15.554
The-the job, I mean?

39:15.587 --> 39:18.524
He's got the makings
of a good one.

39:18.557 --> 39:20.492
(sighs)

39:20.526 --> 39:23.462
You have no idea
what he's had to overcome.

39:23.495 --> 39:25.564
I'm really proud of him.

39:25.597 --> 39:27.966
You tell him I said so, okay?

39:27.999 --> 39:32.438
Karen, your son's not gonna
visit you for a while.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.641
(stammers, chuckles)

39:35.674 --> 39:37.142
(laughs)

39:37.175 --> 39:39.077
(stammers)
You had me.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.547
Yeah?
Yeah.

39:41.580 --> 39:44.049
I thought you were serious.
I'm thinking,

39:44.082 --> 39:46.618
"Did I do something wrong?
Is Jimmy mad at me?"

39:46.652 --> 39:48.587
(scoffs)

39:48.620 --> 39:51.056
You are a real player,
aren't you?

39:53.158 --> 39:55.961
I'm not letting him
get played anymore.

39:55.994 --> 39:58.697
What?

39:58.730 --> 40:01.199
The guy you sent your son
to meet, Trey Smith,

40:01.232 --> 40:02.801
he's your go-to for contraband.

40:02.834 --> 40:04.470
Phones,
cigarettes, pills.

40:04.503 --> 40:05.937
That's the type of stuff
that can give you a lot

40:05.971 --> 40:07.806
of control over what
goes on in here.

40:07.839 --> 40:10.476
Only, he's been selling
to another inmate-- Deidra--

40:10.509 --> 40:12.544
probably because she's willing
to give him a bigger cut.

40:12.578 --> 40:14.079
You have no idea how hard it is

40:14.112 --> 40:16.582
and the things that you have
to do to survive.

40:16.615 --> 40:17.883
You used your son
to send a message:

40:17.916 --> 40:19.585
"Stay away from
the competition."

40:19.618 --> 40:20.752
Jimmy wanted to help me.

40:20.786 --> 40:22.020
Oka-- I-I need to talk to him.

40:22.053 --> 40:23.455
That's not gonna happen,

40:23.489 --> 40:25.757
not after I tell him
the truth about you.

40:29.027 --> 40:30.996
Who do you think you are?

40:33.965 --> 40:36.802
Black guy, hot shot, sitting
here, talking to me like this?

40:39.905 --> 40:41.873
(scoffs)
You mean

40:41.907 --> 40:44.510
nothing to him.

40:44.543 --> 40:46.011
You really think
he's gonna trust you

40:46.044 --> 40:48.580
over me?

40:48.614 --> 40:50.649
I saved that little ass of his.

40:50.682 --> 40:52.918
I am here because of him.

40:54.052 --> 40:56.522
Wow, lady.

40:56.555 --> 40:58.189
(chuckles)

40:58.223 --> 41:00.025
You are a piece of work.

41:00.058 --> 41:02.160
(sighs)

41:02.193 --> 41:04.896
I wondered how Street
could be such a mess,

41:04.930 --> 41:06.865
but now that
I've met you,

41:06.898 --> 41:10.235
I just got to wonder how he
managed to turn out so good.

41:18.276 --> 41:20.211
I'm sorry.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.649
I-I-I...

41:23.682 --> 41:25.584
I know that you're
just trying to help,

41:25.617 --> 41:26.818
and you're right
about all of it.

41:29.120 --> 41:32.824
Just, please
don't tell him.

41:32.858 --> 41:35.994
(crying)

41:36.027 --> 41:40.031
If you care about him
as much as I do, you won't,

41:40.065 --> 41:42.000
'cause it'll crush him.

41:45.771 --> 41:47.505
Don't call him anymore.

41:56.915 --> 41:58.316
You mess with him,

41:58.349 --> 42:01.119
you're messing with me.

42:01.152 --> 42:03.088
My family.

42:16.134 --> 42:26.177
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

42:26.177 --> 42:33.952
