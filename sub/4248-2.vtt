THIS ONE?.

03:26.539 --> 03:27.957
YEAH. I.... THINK
IT WENT IN THE BUSHES.

NO, WE CAN'T DO THAT.

ARE YOU OK?

04:17.798 --> 04:19.466
YEAH.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.386
{\an1}SO WHAT WAS IT LIKE UP THERE?
SEE ANY GHOSTS?

04:24.430 --> 04:28.142
NO. JUST MICE. AND SOME
SPIDERS. POSSIBLY A RAT.

04:28.226 --> 04:30.687
UGGGH! YOU ARE SO BRAVE!

04:32.480 --> 04:35.066
NIGHT YOU TWO. SEE
YOU IN THE MORNING.

04:35.149 --> 04:36.567
NIGHT.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.405
YOU DID GOOD.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.532
{\an3}THANKS.

04:42.615 --> 04:46.577
DON'T TELL PATRICIA, BUT MY
HANDS WERE SHAKING SO HARD

04:46.661 --> 04:48.162
IT TOOK ME THREE TRIES TO
GET THE CLIP IN THE LOCK.

04:48.246 --> 04:52.208

WAS GOING TO GET YOU.

05:24.490 --> 05:27.660
YEAH, EITHER VICTOR OR THE
FLESH EATING ZOMBIES.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.163
NO ZOMBIES. MOSTLY RAT BONES.

05:30.246 --> 05:31.539
COOL.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.624
WAS IT REALLY SCARY UP THERE?

05:33.708 --> 05:37.045
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WORSE.
IT WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF COOL.

05:37.128 --> 05:38.588
I MIGHT MOVE UP THERE.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.256
DON'T YOU THINK
SHE WAS BRAVE?

05:40.339 --> 05:42.383
EVEN YOU HAVE TO
ADMIT PATRICIA

05:42.800 --> 05:45.053
NINA PASSED HER INITIATION TEST
WITH FLYING COLORS.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.930
NO. SHE DIDN'T BRING
ANYTHING BACK DID SHE?

05:48.014 --> 05:50.183
WELL ACTUALLY ....

05:52.018 --> 05:54.187
YES
<i>[laughs]</i>

05:55.688 --> 05:58.232
PATRICIA. WAIT!

06:01.194 --> 06:03.821
{\an1}<i>HEY! NINA.</i>

06:04.197 --> 06:07.658
{\an1}I JUST WANTED TO ASK IF
YOU DID'NT MIND IF I.....

06:09.243 --> 06:11.579
{\an1}DO YOU FANCY WALKING
OVER WITH ME?

06:11.662 --> 06:15.291
{\an3}YEAH. OK. SURE.
I WOULD "FANCY" THAT.

06:18.044 --> 06:21.214
{\an6}SORRY.
THIS ALL JUST TAKES
SOME GETTING USED TO

06:21.297 --> 06:24.175
BUT THIS IS WEIRD
EVEN FOR ENGLAND.

06:24.258 --> 06:26.302
NO, NO WAIT, I'M JUST
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

06:26.385 --> 06:27.804
THAT MUCH I GOT.

06:27.887 --> 06:28.304
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

06:28.387 --> 06:30.098
HANG ON, HANG ON.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.600
I'M HANGING.

06:35.103 --> 06:37.605
YES.

06:39.315 --> 06:40.441
{\an1}I GOT IT!

06:42.568 --> 06:45.404
UNLESS YOU WANTED THAT THERE.

06:45.488 --> 06:49.158
{\an5}I THINK THIS NEEDS TO FIND
ITS WAY BACK INTO VICTOR'S
KEY BOX BEFORE IT'S MISSED.

06:49.242 --> 06:54.247
{\an6}NO ACTUALLY BECAUSE I'M
GOING TO NEED THIS WHEN I
GO BACK INTO THE ATTIC.

06:54.330 --> 06:56.499
YOU'RE GOING BACK
UP INTO THE ATTIC?

06:56.582 --> 07:00.169
IT DIDN'T SOUND SO CRAZY
UNTIL I SAID IT OUT LOUD.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.214
{\an1}WHY WOULD YOU RISK
GETTING CAUGHT AGAIN?

07:03.297 --> 07:06.050
{\an3}EVEN THOUGH I WAS TERRIFIED
WHEN I WAS UP THERE,

07:06.134 --> 07:09.262
{\an5}IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SINCE
IíVE BEEN HERE THAT I
WASN'T THINKING ABOUT GRAN

07:09.345 --> 07:12.640
{\an3}OR TRYING TO GET
PATRICIA TO LIKE ME.

07:12.723 --> 07:14.100
AND I JUST... I REALLY
NEED TO KNOW...

07:14.183 --> 07:15.101
NEED TO KNOW WHAT?

07:15.184 --> 07:16.727
IF I SAW SOMEONE UP THERE.

07:16.811 --> 07:19.063
YOU SAW SOMEONE?

07:19.147 --> 07:22.525
OK, I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY,

07:22.608 --> 07:26.487
{\an6}OK. WHAT IF THERE
REALLY IS SOMETHING WEIRD
ABOUT JOY'S DISSAPEARANCE?

07:26.571 --> 07:28.281
{\an3}WHAT IF JOY
IS STILL HERE?

07:28.364 --> 07:32.285
{\an6}YEAH, YOU'RE
PROBABLY RIGHT.
CRAZY!

07:34.203 --> 07:37.290
<i>[laughing]</i>

07:37.707 --> 07:39.584
OK, I'VE BEEN THINKING <i> .</i>

07:39.667 --> 07:41.544
{\an1}YOU SHOULD DO
SOMETHING FOR AMBER.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.212
{\an1}YOU KNOW,
SOMETHING 'ROMANTIC'.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.589
SHE'S MADE THE FIRST
MOVE, WITH THAT KISS,

07:44.672 --> 07:47.633
NOW YOU NEED TO FOLLOW IT UP
WITH A FEW MOVES OF YOUR OWN.

07:47.717 --> 07:50.178
YOU'RE RIGHT!
LIKE WHAT?

07:50.261 --> 07:51.679
{\an1}OH, THE MAESTRO HAS A FEW
TRICKS UP HIS SLEEVEÖ.

07:51.762 --> 07:53.681
WHO'S THE MAESTRO?

07:53.764 --> 07:54.724
ME! I'M THE MAESTRO.

07:54.807 --> 07:56.893
{\an3}OH, OK,

07:56.976 --> 07:58.561
BUT YOU GOTTA LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU CHANGE NICKNAMES.

07:58.644 --> 08:01.230
I MEAN, LAST WEEK YOU WERE
"CAPTAIN SPAGHETTI".

08:01.314 --> 08:03.566
{\an5}I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU'RE SO UPSET THAT
NINA PASSED YOUR TEST.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.234
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.653
{\an4}NOBODY SEEMS TO
BE TAKING THIS JOY THING
SERIOUSLY EXCEPT ME.

08:07.737 --> 08:10.323
{\an4}SHE WOULD HAVE CALLED
ME BY NOW MARA!
YOU KNOW SHE WOULD.

08:10.406 --> 08:12.533
{\an3}IT IS STRANGE; I'LL
GIVE YOU THAT.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.535
{\an1}STRANGE? IT'S MORE
THAN STRANGE.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.245
BUT NO-ONE CARES.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.498
{\an4}EVERYONE'S MORE
INTERESTED IN BUDDYING
UP WITH THE NEW GIRL

08:19.582 --> 08:21.542
{\an1}AS IF JOY NEVER
EVEN EXISTED.

08:22.877 --> 08:25.421
I WONDER.....

08:27.089 --> 08:29.300
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:29.383 --> 08:31.135
{\an3}YOU CAN'T JUST BREAK
INTO HER LOCKER.

08:31.219 --> 08:33.804
{\an1}WATCH ME

08:34.263 --> 08:36.849
VANDALISM WILL NOT BE TOLERATED
IN THIS SCHOOL PATRICIA.

08:36.933 --> 08:40.811
{\an5}YOU WILL PAY FOR THAT
TO BE REPAIRED AND YOU
ARE ALSO GROUNDED.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.438
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH
JOY? WHERE IS SHE?

08:43.522 --> 08:45.233
PULL YOURSELF
TOGETHER YOUNG LADY.

08:45.316 --> 08:48.069
WHY WON'T YOU GIVE ME HER
HOME NUMBER AT LEAST?

08:48.152 --> 08:49.737
PATRICIA.

08:49.820 --> 08:52.740
LEAVE ME ALONE.

08:53.282 --> 08:56.369
HEY MICK.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.248
{\an3}HE'S STILL PRETENDING
TO BE JEALOUS.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.208
{\an6}HE'LL MAKE A BIG
GESTURE SOON TO
WIN ME BACK,

09:02.291 --> 09:03.876
I KNOW HE WILL.

09:03.960 --> 09:09.257
{\an4}(<i> quetly)</i>

09:10.841 --> 09:13.469
{\an1}SORT OF? WHAT KIND OF
AN ANSWER IS THAT?

09:14.345 --> 09:16.764
WELL, THERE ARE
SOME OTHER THINGS.

09:16.847 --> 09:19.934
{\an1}YOU'RE A REAL GIRL OF
MYSTERY AREN'T YOU?

09:20.601 --> 09:26.190
{\an1}LOOK, IF YOU'RE GOING UP THERE
AGAIN, THEN I'M COMING WITH YOU.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.192
AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.861
WOW. THAT WAS FORCEFUL.

09:31.654 --> 09:34.198
IT WAS, WASN'T IT?

09:34.282 --> 09:38.536
YOU CAN TRUST ME
NINA. I PROMISE.

09:40.037 --> 09:44.166
{\an1}OK, BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING
DRASTIC TO PROVE YOUR LOYALTY,

09:44.250 --> 09:46.586
I'LL TELL YOU..

09:58.055 --> 10:02.184
{\an5}<i>IT'S JUST HER FRUSTRATION</i>
<i>COMING OUT SHE'LL CALM DOWN</i>
<i>EVENTUALLY. DON'T WORRY.</i>

BEEN AVOIDED. THERE WAS
NO NEED FOR SUCH HASTE.

WILL NOT LET THIS GO.

10:16.407 --> 10:19.201
{\an1}SHE'S DETERMINED TO FIND OUT
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO JOY.

10:19.285 --> 10:23.164
{\an5}AND WE MUST BE EQUALLY
DETERMINED TO MAKE SURE
SHE NEVER DOES ERIC.

10:23.247 --> 10:25.708
THERE'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE.

10:34.633 --> 10:36.969
MARA, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

10:37.053 --> 10:40.973
{\an5}SOMETHING BAD HAS HAPPENED
TO JOY AND THE TEACHERS ARE
INVOLVED IN IT.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.016

KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?

10:51.317 --> 10:53.903
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?

10:53.986 --> 10:56.864
{\an5}ACT AS A LOOK OUT WHILE I GO
INTO MR SWEET'S OFFICE AND
STEAL HER FILE.

10:56.947 --> 10:59.825
WHAT?!

11:01.077 --> 11:05.998
"IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM TONIGHT?
11 P.M.? KISS KISS KISS A".

11:06.082 --> 11:08.417
THE LAUNDRY ROOM?
NOW THAT IS CLASSY.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.585
THAT'S DUMB, RIGHT?

11:09.668 --> 11:12.088
NO, NO NO NO. IT'S NOT DUMB AT
ALL. IT'S VERY INTIMATE.

WILD WITH JEALOUSY.

11:34.193 --> 11:39.156

FOR HIS BAD BEHAVIOUR WITH
MARA AND KISS AND MAKE UP.

{\an5}I'M SURE THAT'S TRUE. IF
HE'S THE ONE WHO SENT THE
MESSAGE.

14:46.385 --> 14:49.221
WAIT.

14:49.305 --> 14:52.224
WAIT, WHAT'S THAT?

14:55.227 --> 14:58.647
IT LOOKS LIKE EGYPTIAN
HIEROGLYPHICS.

14:58.731 --> 15:03.319
{\an5}YOU KNOW, THE OLD LADY SAID
THERE WAS TREASURE HIDDEN IN
THIS HOUSE.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.154
WHAT KIND OF TREASURE?

15:05.237 --> 15:07.823
WELL, SHE HARDLY KNOWS HER NAME
SO SHE WASN'T THAT SPECIFIC.

15:07.906 --> 15:10.951
BUT...MAYBE WE SHOULD
GO TALK TO HER?

15:20.419 --> 15:24.173
AMBER? AMBER?!

15:24.256 --> 15:26.300
{\an3}MICK?

15:26.383 --> 15:31.347
{\an4}WELL THIS IS A FIRST, AMBER
MILLINGTON VOLUNTARILY STEPPING
FOOT IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

15:33.807 --> 15:35.309
{\an1}WHAT'S WRONG? WHAT
íS THE MATTER?

15:35.392 --> 15:39.271
BOYS.

15:39.355 --> 15:43.609
OH LOVE, COME HERE.

15:43.692 --> 15:47.863
WELL I SUGGEST YOU
GO AND FRESHEN UP.

15:47.946 --> 15:52.076
{\an4}UNLESS YOU WANT TO GO
TO SCHOOL SMELLING LIKE
ALFIE'S OLD SOCKS.

16:03.420 --> 16:07.216
{\an5}I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT AMBER WAS EXPECTING
MICK INSTEAD OF YOU.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.593
DO YOU RECKON SOMEONE
MESSED WITH YOUR MESSAGE?

16:09.677 --> 16:10.552
DUHH WHAT DO YOU THINK?

16:10.636 --> 16:12.304
BUT WHO WOULD DO THAT?

16:12.388 --> 16:14.181
MICK OBVIOUSLY.

16:14.264 --> 16:16.475
HA HA YEAH! MICK, OF COURSE.
I SHOULD'VE THOUGHT OF THAT.

16:16.558 --> 16:21.230
{\an5}TRYING TO WHEEDLE HIS WAY
BACK IN WITH AMBER. LOOKS
LIKE HE SUCCEEDED.

16:21.313 --> 16:24.733
{\an5}NO, NO NO NO. AMBERíS STILL
GOT THE HOTS FOR YOU MAN.
WITHOUT A DOUBT.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.319
{\an5}DIDN'T LOOK THAT WAY WHEN
SHE WAS PUSHING ME OUT OF
THE ROOM.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.321
OKAY LOOK.

16:29.405 --> 16:34.702
{\an5}TWENTY SAYS THAT I CAN GET
MICK TOTALLY OUT OF AMBER'S
LIFE BY THE END OF THE WEEK,

16:34.785 --> 16:39.289
AND PAVE THE WAY FOR YOU TO
MOVE IN THERE. EASY....TWENTY.

16:39.373 --> 16:44.461
NO. I NEED PAYMENT IN
ADVANCE, CASHFLOW PROBLEMS.

16:45.546 --> 16:50.342
THANK YOU

16:51.260 --> 16:54.596
OK, IF SWEETIE COMES ALONG,
JUST KEEP HIM TALKING.

16:54.680 --> 16:58.726
I'M NOT SO GOOD AT THAT
TALKING TO PEOPLE THING.

17:02.730 --> 17:05.441
OH, MR SWEET? HEY.

17:05.523 --> 17:08.777
YES, MARA?

17:08.861 --> 17:15.075
{\an5}I WAS WONDERING IF I
COULD TALK TO YOU. ABOUT
SOME THINGS. ON MY MIND.

17:15.159 --> 17:20.622
{\an5}THINGS I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT AND WANTING TO TALK
ABOUT WITH YOU.

17:20.705 --> 17:25.085
<i>ALRIGHT, MARA. GO AHEAD.</i>

17:25.169 --> 17:32.134
{\an5}<i>JUST THINGS.</i>
<i>LIKE....ENDANGERED...ENDANGERED</i>
<i>HEDGEHOGS.</i>

17:32.217 --> 17:32.968
HEDGEHOGS?

17:33.051 --> 17:34.386
YES, WHAT'S WRONG WITH
HEDGEHOGS?

17:34.470 --> 17:36.680
WELL NOTHING,

17:36.764 --> 17:39.224
IT'S JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE
NOT SWEET AND FURRY.

17:39.308 --> 17:44.938
HEDGEHOGS DEMAND OUR RESPECT
MR. SWEET AND OUR SYMPATHY.

17:45.022 --> 17:49.234
{\an5}HUNDREDS OF THEM GET KILLED
ON OUR ROADS EVERY YEAR AND
WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING

17:53.405 --> 17:57.159
TEACH THEM ROAD SAFETY?
(chuckles )

17:57.242 --> 18:00.120
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED ANIMALS.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.414
ALRIGHT MARA. PERHAPS
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:02.498 --> 18:05.459
PERHAPS I'M NOT BEING ENTIRELY
FAIR TO THE HEDGEHOGS.

18:05.542 --> 18:07.628
<i>SO, PLEASE, TELL ME MORE.</i>

18:07.711 --> 18:12.800
{\an5}NAH, YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S
PRETTY BORING. SEE YOU
LATER MR. SWEET...

18:12.883 --> 18:15.052
HI PATRICIA.

18:12.883 --> 18:15.052
HI MARA.

18:15.135 --> 18:19.181
{\an3}BETTER HURRY,
WE'RE LATE FOR HISTORY.

18:23.560 --> 18:28.816
{\an1}VICTOR,
WHAT BEAUTIFUL ROSES!

18:28.899 --> 18:33.153
IT'S FUNNY, I FOUND THIS ONE
IN THE LAUNDRY THIS MORNING.

18:33.237 --> 18:35.948
WONDERED WHY IT DIDN'T
HUM AS MUCH TODAY...

18:36.031 --> 18:37.032
NOW I WONDER HOW ON
EARTH THAT GOT THERE?

18:37.115 --> 18:42.746
{\an1}I HAVEN'T THE FAINTEST IDEA,
BUT IT'S WILTING.

18:42.830 --> 18:45.874
{\an6}WELL
IT WAS A LOVELY
GESTURE ANYWAY.

18:45.958 --> 18:50.921
{\an3}BRIGHTENED UP MY DAY
IT DID...

19:28.500 --> 19:32.421
(school bell rings)

19:33.547 --> 19:36.466
{\an3}WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST WRITE
DOWN THE NUMBER?

19:36.550 --> 19:39.928
{\an4}ER I DIDN'T HAVE TIME DID
I WITH YOUR BRILLIANT
HEDGEHOG DISTRACTION?

19:40.012 --> 19:44.558
KEEP A LOOK-OUT FOR TEACHERS.

19:44.641 --> 19:47.769
YES!! IT'S GOT HER HOME
NUMBER.

19:47.853 --> 19:51.940
GREAT. NOW LET'S GET BACK
AND I'LL GIVE HER A CALL.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.818
(phone rings)

19:54.902 --> 19:56.695
HELLO?

19:56.778 --> 20:00.324
IT'S ME. WE HAVE A SITUATION

20:00.407 --> 20:03.452
JOY'S FILE HAS BEEN
TAKEN FROM MY OFFICE.

20:03.535 --> 20:08.540
I'LL DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE
DONE.

20:15.213 --> 20:15.589
COATS, BAGS NOW.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.507
WHAT FOR?

20:17.591 --> 20:18.383
I NEED TO SEARCH THEM.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.677
{\an3}BUT WE HAVENíT GOT ANYTHING
IN THEM.

20:20.761 --> 20:23.555
{\an4}NO BUTS. GIVE THEM TO ME.
YOU CAN HAVE THEM BACK IN
HALF AN HOUR.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.140
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:25.223 --> 20:26.642
WE HAVE TO HAVE OUR BAGS
SEARCHED.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.977
WHY?

20:29.061 --> 20:29.978
PATRICIA?

20:30.062 --> 20:33.357
{\an3}NO.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.942
SOMETHING TO HIDE PATRICIA?

20:35.025 --> 20:36.860
WHAT'S GONE MISSING?

20:36.944 --> 20:40.447
SOMETHING VERY VALUABLE INDEED,

20:40.530 --> 20:43.617
{\an1}AND WHOEVER HAS TAKEN IT IS
IN DEEP, DEEP TROUBLE.

20:43.700 --> 20:47.579
{\an1}NOW GIVE.
