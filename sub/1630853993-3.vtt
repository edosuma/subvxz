WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.680
This programme contains strong
language and some violent scenes

00:04.680 --> 00:07.360
Correction is a method of real time
image manipulation, using the

00:07.360 --> 00:10.320
disruption of camera feeds and the
deployment of deep-fake technology.

00:10.320 --> 00:12.880
So it has a name,
what happened to me?

00:12.880 --> 00:15.800
Rachel certainly made
an impression on Turner.

00:15.800 --> 00:18.040
Wouldn't hurt to keep him on side.

00:18.040 --> 00:22.040
You seem to forget how close
she came to reporting us.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.480
If you still don't trust her, Gemma,
you know what to do.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.120
Keep her close.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.640
I'm filming this for my dossier,

00:29.640 --> 00:32.800
detailing the systematic,
illegal practice of

00:32.800 --> 00:35.840
video evidence tampering
known as Correction.

00:35.840 --> 00:39.080
If you need technical help with the
BBC, I'll loan you one of my guys.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.720
But if I find out you put them
on China, the deal's off.

00:41.720 --> 00:43.600
You're convinced China's
responsible?

00:43.600 --> 00:46.160
Beijing is trying to
meddle in British policy.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.720
Yan Wanglei, Xanda's man in London,

00:48.720 --> 00:51.520
he's a part of it. I'm certain.

00:51.520 --> 00:54.720
Sometimes to seems to me
as if there are

00:54.720 --> 00:56.360
two Isaac Turners.

00:56.360 --> 00:59.960
So which Isaac Turner should
I believe?

00:59.960 --> 01:03.320
As London's CEO of
Xanda Facial Rec,

01:03.320 --> 01:07.560
Yan Wanglei has the motive
and the technical capability.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.960
I'm sorry to hear about
your detective sergeant.

01:09.960 --> 01:11.480
GUNSHOTS

01:11.480 --> 01:15.200
You he was shot but
you didn't say if he survived.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.560
No, I didn't.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.720
How do you feel about joining
the surveillance unit?

01:18.720 --> 01:20.840
We need eyes on Yan Wanglei.

01:20.840 --> 01:22.160
Sir.

01:22.160 --> 01:23.760
Patrick, you'd better wake up.

01:23.760 --> 01:24.920
We need you.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.640
No, I haven't joined them.

01:27.640 --> 01:30.160
I am trying to beat them.

01:30.160 --> 01:33.680
And they are watching me
day and night.

01:33.680 --> 01:36.200
Isaac Turner's just cut his
protection officers loose.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.000
He's booked himself on Newsnight.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.800
Mr Turner!

01:39.800 --> 01:42.160
They kill people to protect it.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.320
Have you got a plan to expose it?

01:44.320 --> 01:45.760
Have you changed your mind?

01:45.760 --> 01:48.120
I've reached my decision
to recommend to the cabinet...

01:48.120 --> 01:51.440
..see profiling as an AI flaw.
Xanda treats it as a selling point.

01:51.440 --> 01:53.160
Somebody stop this broadcast!

01:53.160 --> 01:54.440
It's not cutting!

01:54.440 --> 01:56.360
I'm advocating the use
of racial profiling

01:56.360 --> 01:57.880
wherever it keeps us safe.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.000
We've been hacked.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.720
This has been changed, faked.

02:00.720 --> 02:03.000
Corrected.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.200
You need to prove it definitively,

02:06.200 --> 02:08.120
so no-one can deny it.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.480
And how do you suggest doing that?

02:10.480 --> 02:11.920
Together.

02:16.920 --> 02:20.480
I've just committed
career suicide on live TV.

02:21.560 --> 02:23.000
Except I haven't.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.920
And...what? I'm expected
to stay silent?

02:28.240 --> 02:29.640
My wife thinks I've gone insane,

02:29.640 --> 02:31.000
my staff are threatening to quit

02:31.000 --> 02:33.200
and the Home Secretary's
stopped answering my calls.

02:33.200 --> 02:34.960
I understand how difficult
this must be.

02:34.960 --> 02:36.160
Oh, oh, do you?

02:36.160 --> 02:38.640
Because last time I looked
it wasn't you on camera extolling

02:38.640 --> 02:41.000
the virtues of racial bias.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.800
I thought you said
he was being cooperative?

02:43.800 --> 02:45.360
All things considered.

02:45.360 --> 02:47.040
PHONE VIBRATES

02:48.400 --> 02:51.400
Perhaps it's not my place
to remind you of the stakes.

02:51.400 --> 02:52.600
No need.

02:55.760 --> 02:59.560
Your minion explained it to us
on pain of death.

02:59.560 --> 03:01.240
Issues of National Security,

03:01.240 --> 03:03.840
the likes of which we can never
know or understand.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.600
I appreciate your support.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.240
We're all public servants, eh?

03:12.040 --> 03:14.880
And I shall just have
to cling to my much tested belief

03:14.880 --> 03:19.120
that you people have the nation's
best interests at heart,

03:19.120 --> 03:21.400
and assume you'll do everything
in your power

03:21.400 --> 03:23.680
to prevent this ever
happening again.

03:26.160 --> 03:29.880
We'll need you to answer some
questions, go over what happened.

03:29.880 --> 03:33.200
Fine. But as this is past
my bedtime,

03:33.200 --> 03:36.720
I'm going to need a little something
to keep me going.

03:36.720 --> 03:39.880
Luckily, I know where
Ed keeps his stash.

03:41.640 --> 03:43.320
Coffee. SHE LAUGHS

03:43.320 --> 03:44.600
Anyone else?

03:44.600 --> 03:46.000
Thank you.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.680
I can't promise milk and sugar.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.240
She seems very compliant.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.760
How the hell did you manage that?

04:01.560 --> 04:03.920
Learning from you, ma'am.

04:05.720 --> 04:07.720
RADIO:  Control to Kilo 1.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.040
Kilo 1.

05:03.960 --> 05:06.080
Most common cause of compromise.

05:07.680 --> 05:10.120
Sorry?

05:10.120 --> 05:12.040
Needing a wee.

05:12.040 --> 05:13.400
I don't.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.960
Your leg is shaking.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.600
I don't need a wee.

05:18.880 --> 05:21.000
There's only one option if you do.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.880
I'm not going to wet myself
in your car.

05:22.880 --> 05:24.320
You wouldn't be the first.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.120
Movement.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.040
Kilo 9 to Control.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.720
Control, Kilo 9. Go ahead.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.440
Eyes on target.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.480
Guv?

05:57.480 --> 05:59.560
Wanglei is mobile.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.720
I want the holy trinity of tracking.

06:11.720 --> 06:13.720
Eyes on, face rec and GPS.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.120
Sir.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.760
Confirm eyeball on target, Kilo 9.

06:24.800 --> 06:25.920
Pos ID.

06:25.920 --> 06:27.360
Run facial rec.

06:27.360 --> 06:28.560
Happening.

06:34.240 --> 06:35.560
Target ID confirmed.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.040
Facial Rec confirmed.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.760
Run vehicle check.

06:40.760 --> 06:41.880
Kilo 9 to Control.

06:41.880 --> 06:44.120
Target is in a black
S class Mercedes,

06:44.120 --> 06:48.840
registration 735 D812.

06:48.840 --> 06:51.120
Confirmed.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.160
Diplomatic plates.

06:53.160 --> 06:56.320
Good to know the Embassy's
looking after him.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.920
Get me into that Merc.

06:59.960 --> 07:01.800
Stand by. Stand by.

07:01.800 --> 07:03.240
Target on the move.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.720
Track that vehicle.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.200
Kilo 9, tail target.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.240
Stay close, Kilo 9.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.280
Maintain eyeball on target.

07:13.280 --> 07:14.640
Understood.

07:22.480 --> 07:25.760
Kilo 9 to Control. Target
turning left on Gower Road.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.880
Run ANPR.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.040
Happening.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.080
Confirmed.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.840
How's that GPS?

07:36.720 --> 07:38.400
We're into the Merc.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.920
Outstanding.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.360
TRANSLATION:

08:00.800 --> 08:03.200
Tell us what you've got, Kilo 9.

08:03.200 --> 08:05.680
Target turning left onto
Mandeville Place.

08:09.160 --> 08:10.440
Confirmed.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.080
Target held at the junction
with Bellevue Road.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.400
Confirmed.

08:27.080 --> 08:29.040
TYRES SCREECH

08:29.040 --> 08:31.560
Target just ran a red light.
Tail compromised.

08:31.560 --> 08:33.600
This is Control to Kilo 9.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.600
I don't care if the target
knows you're there.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.520
Just don't let him out of
your sight.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.040
Understood.

08:39.040 --> 08:41.040
HORN BEEPS

08:49.560 --> 08:51.440
He does not want to be followed.

08:51.440 --> 08:52.760
Tough shit.

08:52.760 --> 08:53.880
PHONE RINGING

08:53.880 --> 08:56.320
TV:  A spokesperson for the Muslim
Council of Great Britain

08:56.320 --> 08:58.320
has called on Security Minister
Isaac Turner to

08:58.320 --> 09:02.560
"apologise or resign" after comments
he made about racial profiling AI

09:02.560 --> 09:04.560
earlier this evening.

09:04.560 --> 09:07.560
The minister's claims are not just
absurd and offensive -

09:07.560 --> 09:08.840
they are inflammatory,

09:08.840 --> 09:11.960
and reinforce the most damaging
racial stereotypes.

09:11.960 --> 09:15.040
The truth is racial-profiling
is what makes Xanda

09:15.040 --> 09:18.880
the most effective security system
on the market.

09:18.880 --> 09:21.800
If, say, and I'm not saying
this is the case,

09:21.800 --> 09:24.680
but if, say, Muslim men
between the ages of 17...

09:24.680 --> 09:25.720
Is it Daddy?

09:25.720 --> 09:28.640
..were the most likely demographic
to launch an attack on an airport...

09:28.640 --> 09:30.600
No. It wasn't him. SHE SNIFFS

09:30.600 --> 09:33.480
Go back to bed, Harrison.
It's the middle of the night.

09:33.480 --> 09:35.400
When is he coming back?

09:37.240 --> 09:38.880
Soon, darling.

09:38.880 --> 09:41.000
Go. I'll come and kiss you
night-night in a minute.

09:43.880 --> 09:45.520
PHONE ALERT

09:52.640 --> 09:54.080
Call for support.

09:54.080 --> 09:56.400
I want everyone here
ID'd, questioned

09:56.400 --> 09:58.400
and slap a D-notice on
the whole lot.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.280
If they're not suspects
they're witnesses.

10:01.280 --> 10:02.760
Christ.

10:04.720 --> 10:07.280
Journos!

10:07.280 --> 10:09.560
Can't think of worse people
to try to keep quiet.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.760
Ma'am, from where I was standing,

10:11.760 --> 10:13.920
I don't think any
of them witnessed it.

10:13.920 --> 10:16.280
They know something happened
but they were all watching

10:16.280 --> 10:17.640
the fake version.

10:17.640 --> 10:19.680
The whole system was taken
over remotely,

10:19.680 --> 10:20.920
not just the feeds.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.080
The hardware.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.600
The edit was locked on Turner
in that control room.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.240
They couldn't cut away.

10:30.160 --> 10:33.600
We need a list of everybody with
access to that room, that kit.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.280
Somebody here must be complicit.

10:37.440 --> 10:38.560
What about Khan?

10:38.560 --> 10:39.840
No.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.080
Khadija Khan's reaction,
I just, erm...

10:43.040 --> 10:46.040
I just think somebody behind
the scenes is more likely.

10:49.280 --> 10:51.040
DSU GARLAND SIGHS

11:00.800 --> 11:02.440
Kilo 9 to Control.

11:02.440 --> 11:03.760

11:03.760 --> 11:05.760
Target joining the A4.

11:05.760 --> 11:06.960
Confirmed.

11:06.960 --> 11:09.040
Confirmed. A4 Westbound.

11:11.440 --> 11:13.800
Westbound.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.680
What's the target's home address?

11:17.880 --> 11:20.360
The Grange, Five Oak Green.

11:20.360 --> 11:22.600
Five Oak Green,
what the fuck is that?

11:22.600 --> 11:25.000
A village in Kent.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.960
Well, he's not headed there, is he?

11:26.960 --> 11:29.040
Not unless he's taking
the scenic route.

11:35.160 --> 11:36.800
Kilo 9 to Control.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.640
Target joining the M4 Motorway.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.000
Confirmed.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.240
Confirmed. The M4, westbound.

11:51.280 --> 11:53.120
Control to Kilo 1.

11:53.120 --> 11:54.480
Go ahead.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.000
Suspect is on the move.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.800
Direction of Heathrow.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.160
Check passenger logs.

12:01.160 --> 12:02.440
Happening.

12:06.400 --> 12:09.200
No name matches any flights
to Beijing in the next 24 hours.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.160
Could be travelling under
a false ID.

12:11.160 --> 12:12.640
You're talking about Wanglei?

12:12.640 --> 12:14.760
We can't let him board a plane,
Kilo 1.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.520
I'm aware. It's a political
decision.

12:16.520 --> 12:17.920
You want to wake up the Home Sec?

12:17.920 --> 12:19.160
No, no.

12:21.360 --> 12:24.120
Look, you want Government backing
to arrest a Chinese national?

12:24.120 --> 12:25.560
Top cover, ideally. Home Sec or PM.

12:25.560 --> 12:27.720
Yeah, by the time you get
a straight answer the target

12:27.720 --> 12:29.360
will be in the air.

12:29.360 --> 12:30.960
What makes you say that?

12:33.160 --> 12:34.560
Kilo 9 to Control.

12:34.560 --> 12:36.560
Target passing M4 Junction 2.

12:36.560 --> 12:37.880
Confirmed.  Confirmed.

12:37.880 --> 12:39.720
15 minutes to Terminal 1.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.640
I'm the Security Minister.

12:43.640 --> 12:45.880
I can declare a critical incident.

12:45.880 --> 12:47.360
Why wake up Gill when you've got me?

12:51.000 --> 12:53.280
I can't stop him in
a diplomatic vehicle.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.800
I'm aware.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.600
Arrest when target shows
intent to travel,

12:56.600 --> 12:59.120
issue an all-ports warning,
delay every flight headed east.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.480
Target steps into Departures,
that's good enough for me.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.480
I'm heading to Heathrow with
a green light from

13:03.480 --> 13:04.680
the Security Minister.

No, nothing, ma'am.

13:29.360 --> 13:32.040

conspiracy to murder.

13:34.360 --> 13:38.800
The target must demonstrate
intent to leave the UK.

13:38.800 --> 13:43.280
Arrest teams at every terminal,
remain inside Departures.

13:43.280 --> 13:45.120
Target sees armed guards
at the door,

13:45.120 --> 13:47.240
he might get twitchy
and change his mind.

13:47.240 --> 13:49.040
Kilo 9 to Control.

13:49.040 --> 13:52.200
Target passing M4 Junction 3.

13:52.200 --> 13:54.280
Stay on him, Kilo 9.

13:54.280 --> 13:56.400
You may not have
power of arrest yet,

13:56.400 --> 13:59.560
but you have the power to stay
up his arse.

That's not necessary, Ms Khan.
You can stay.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.080

14:11.600 --> 14:13.080
I need to see the interview again.

14:13.080 --> 14:14.640
Do you know your way round this?

VOICE OF ISAAC:  You asked me
if Xanda had been tested for

14:23.920 --> 14:27.280
racial bias. I'm afraid my answer
wasn't entirely accurate.

14:27.280 --> 14:28.560
What is it?

14:28.560 --> 14:30.520
You still think Wanglei
is behind this?

14:30.520 --> 14:32.040
The truth is...

14:32.040 --> 14:34.720
..racial-profiling is what makes
Xanda the most effective

14:34.720 --> 14:36.080
security system on the market.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.800
Yes, I was trying to withdraw
my support for his bid.

14:38.800 --> 14:41.120
He stopped me from saying
China poses a risk.

14:41.120 --> 14:44.000
You were also corrected to say
that Xanda Facial Recognition

14:44.000 --> 14:45.680
makes use of racial profiling.

14:45.680 --> 14:48.880
While most facial recognition
providers see profiling

14:48.880 --> 14:51.560
as an AI flaw, Xanda treats it
as a selling point.

14:51.560 --> 14:55.360
Why would the head of Xanda UK make
you say that about his own company?

14:55.360 --> 14:57.880
I don't know, but he is currently
trying to leave the country.

14:57.880 --> 15:00.720

15:06.040 --> 15:07.200
He's awake?

15:07.200 --> 15:08.920
Doctors just came to check him.

15:08.920 --> 15:11.320
Said they expect him to wake up
in the next hour.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.480
You did say to call
if he so much as stirred.

15:22.480 --> 15:25.000
Yes. Thank you. Ah...

to the hospital?

15:35.400 --> 15:36.680
15 minutes.

15:36.680 --> 15:37.880

15:39.800 --> 15:41.840
Any concern, Kilo 3?

15:42.960 --> 15:44.560
Unclear.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.560
Where's Patrick's family?

15:46.560 --> 15:48.880
PPOs escorted them home just
before the last check.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.080
I'm heading back there.

15:50.080 --> 15:52.000

Check the guard detail.

Understood.

15:55.840 --> 15:57.960
As with everything else
we've discussed, Khadija,

15:57.960 --> 15:59.200
you keep this under wraps.

Until you can give me everything,
the deep-fake scandal.

16:02.680 --> 16:03.840
Correction.

16:03.840 --> 16:05.160
You leave the wording to me.

16:05.160 --> 16:06.440
I'm going to come with you.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.480
I-I can't allow it.
The CPOs will take you home.

16:08.480 --> 16:09.960
I declared this critical incident.

16:09.960 --> 16:12.240
If there's a development
I want to know what's going on.

16:12.240 --> 16:15.760
And, frankly, you're the only one
I trust to tell me the truth.

16:21.200 --> 16:25.480
Ah, don't leave this behind,
Minister. You'll be needing it.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.960
And, as I said,

16:27.960 --> 16:31.440

28:06.640 --> 28:08.040
Red.

28:08.040 --> 28:10.280
Red Bay is empty.

28:10.280 --> 28:12.160
Come again?

28:12.160 --> 28:14.280
No eyes on target vehicle.

28:15.960 --> 28:18.720
Control to Kilo 1. We can't see
you. Confirm terminal.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.680
Kilo 1. Terminal 1.

28:27.680 --> 28:29.440
Departures, Red Bay drop off.

28:29.440 --> 28:30.640
No eyes on target.

28:33.080 --> 28:35.040
No eyes on target vehicle.

28:38.960 --> 28:40.640
No eyes on Kilo 9.

28:48.120 --> 28:50.360
Kilo 9, this is Control.
Do you read?

28:50.360 --> 28:52.640
Control to Kilo 1. Please confirm
visual on target.

28:52.640 --> 28:53.720
Control to Kilo 9?

28:53.720 --> 28:55.000
Kilo 9, confirm location?

28:55.000 --> 28:56.480
Control to Kilo 9?

28:59.480 --> 29:01.000
Kilo 9 to Control.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.880
Target leaving the M25, Exit 5.

29:03.880 --> 29:06.880
Maintain that distance
at your discretion, Kilo 9.

29:06.880 --> 29:08.680
Update when you're ready.

29:15.360 --> 29:17.400
Target arrival at Five Oak Green.

29:17.400 --> 29:19.400
Home address, ETA two minutes.

29:20.720 --> 29:24.120
Kilo 9, this is Control.
Do you read?

29:24.120 --> 29:25.760
Kilo 9, confirm location.

29:25.760 --> 29:27.600
Control to Kilo 1.

29:28.640 --> 29:30.160
Gemma?

29:34.200 --> 29:36.280
Operation Vanguard is compromised.

30:36.680 --> 30:38.560
I'm not exiting the vehicle.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.120
PHONE RINGING

30:48.120 --> 30:50.560
WOMAN: Emergency. Which service
do you require?

30:50.560 --> 30:53.240
Ah, police. My name's Isaac Turner.

30:53.240 --> 30:55.680
I'm the Security Minister
for the Home Office.

30:55.680 --> 30:58.320
I'm currently in pursuit
of a suspect,

30:58.320 --> 31:02.960
or group of suspects, in an ongoing
conspiracy to murder investigation.

31:02.960 --> 31:04.880
What's your location?

31:04.880 --> 31:09.160
Ah, my location is
the Blackfriars Road.

31:10.160 --> 31:13.400
The suspects are driving
a van with the registration

31:13.400 --> 31:20.320
GX66 AEE - that's Golf, X-ray, 66,
Alpha, Echo, Echo.

31:20.320 --> 31:22.840
They're driving south on
the Blackfriars Road,

31:22.840 --> 31:25.640
away from the hospital,
which they've just left,

31:25.640 --> 31:27.480
and where I believe that... SIREN WAILS

31:27.480 --> 31:29.680
All right, I will dispatch...
Oh, you're here now.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.000
I can see a car.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.600
Wow. Was that you?  Isaac, stay
where you are.  One second.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.560
And do not put yourself
in any danger.

31:36.560 --> 31:39.040
Yeah, they're up ahead. Grey van.

31:40.360 --> 31:44.000
Oh, for fuck's sake, can you tell
them? They're trying to...

31:44.000 --> 31:46.200
Isaac, can you repeat where
your location is?

31:46.200 --> 31:48.600
Fucking hell. SIRENS WAIL

31:53.360 --> 31:57.880
I-I'm fine. I've just got 999 here.
I'm just telling them...

31:57.880 --> 31:59.760
MAN: Step out the vehicle
please, sir?

31:59.760 --> 32:02.520
No, no, the van is up there.
If you don't go after them...

32:02.520 --> 32:04.400
Please step out of the vehicle.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.160
Jesus Christ.

32:06.160 --> 32:09.320
They'll change the CCTV
and get away.

32:09.320 --> 32:11.240
Are you the owner of
this vehicle, sir?

32:11.240 --> 32:13.280
Am I the... what?
No, no, of course not.

32:13.280 --> 32:16.200
And are you aware of what speed you
were driving at when we stopped you?

32:16.200 --> 32:17.760
Am...?

32:19.640 --> 32:21.080
You're shitting me.

33:31.280 --> 33:32.880
INDISTINCT SHOUTS

34:17.160 --> 34:19.000
The whole system was overwhelmed.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.160
Camera networks, comms.

34:24.720 --> 34:27.360
Wanglei was never en route
to the airport.

34:27.360 --> 34:29.520
He just knew it'd get our attention.

34:29.520 --> 34:31.600
It isn't him.  I'm sorry?

34:35.560 --> 34:37.720
Where's Isaac Turner? Is he safe?

34:37.720 --> 34:39.800
Yeah, I believe so.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.920
I'm waiting for an update.

34:41.920 --> 34:44.440
Apparently, he says he got a...
We can't talk here.

34:58.400 --> 35:01.560
There's no CCTV in here,
like I said.

35:01.560 --> 35:03.560
No routers.  Thank you.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.920
Let's lose comms and phones, please.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.440
Would you mind keeping these safe?

35:10.840 --> 35:14.040
DETECTOR BEEPS

35:31.360 --> 35:32.720
It's not China.

35:34.320 --> 35:36.840
Just because Wanglei was used
as a decoy

35:36.840 --> 35:38.760
doesn't make him complicit.

35:38.760 --> 35:41.280
The second hack on Newsnight
implicated Xanda

35:41.280 --> 35:43.520
in the use of racial profiling.

35:43.520 --> 35:46.920
That can't be in his interests,
or Beijing's.

35:46.920 --> 35:51.640
The cameras on Flynn's ward
were isolated on a secure network,

35:51.640 --> 35:54.320
controlled from the seventh floor
of CTC.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.680
We know. We're investigating.

35:55.680 --> 35:57.920
Ops are tearing down the system
and starting again.

35:57.920 --> 36:00.280
Whoever's behind this is
watching everything we do -

36:00.280 --> 36:02.240
they know our next move
before we do.

36:02.240 --> 36:05.000
They're into CTC,
STRAP clearance, the BBC.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.520
They're into our secure comms,

36:06.520 --> 36:09.080
and they're faking our own fucking
voices, for Christ's sake!

36:09.080 --> 36:10.960
What is your point?

36:10.960 --> 36:14.480
Who do we know with
that much access,

36:14.480 --> 36:18.600
that much capability, with
his claws into everything we do?

36:20.920 --> 36:23.120
I saw him.

36:23.120 --> 36:25.040
Frank Napier.

36:25.040 --> 36:26.280
Here at the hospital.

36:26.280 --> 36:27.600
Frank was here?

36:27.600 --> 36:30.520
Earlier this evening,
before the hack on the studio.

36:32.200 --> 36:34.360
If you've got any reasoning,
Rachel, let's hear it,

36:34.360 --> 36:36.720
beyond seeing the man here
and listing his capabilities.

36:36.720 --> 36:38.920
The CIA does not have eyes
on the seventh floor.

36:38.920 --> 36:41.640
If they've found a way
to hack into it, they do.

36:41.640 --> 36:43.640
You heard him.

36:43.640 --> 36:48.000
As far as Frank Napier's concerned,
the US is in a cold war with China.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.320
You think this is
a false flag operation?

36:51.320 --> 36:52.840
By America?

36:52.840 --> 36:54.920
It's possible.

36:54.920 --> 36:56.880
A plot to turn the UK against China.

36:58.840 --> 37:02.760
A false flag doesn't explain
the mixed messaging.

37:02.760 --> 37:04.320
There's something else.

37:07.720 --> 37:11.320
You said the hack on the studio
gallery suggested inside help.

37:11.320 --> 37:13.880
Yeah.

37:13.880 --> 37:16.480
Well, while you're running checks
on the director,

37:16.480 --> 37:17.920
the vision mixer, the sound man,

37:17.920 --> 37:20.600
there's another suspect
you might want to consider.

37:20.600 --> 37:21.840
He doesn't work in TV.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.480
You might find him a little bit
closer to home.

37:24.480 --> 37:26.520
It wasn't just the crew
who had access to

37:26.520 --> 37:29.000
the controls in that studio.

37:29.000 --> 37:33.360
Thanks to us, a core member of
Napier's team was given

37:33.360 --> 37:35.800
a full unrestricted pass.

37:35.800 --> 37:37.720
Or thanks to you, to be exact.

37:37.720 --> 37:40.200
What are you driving at?

37:40.200 --> 37:41.920
You're the SIO.

37:41.920 --> 37:44.240
You sent Napier's tech op
into the BBC.

37:45.560 --> 37:47.400
You're in shock, Detective.

37:47.400 --> 37:50.240
That means you're entitled
to be out of line, to a point.

37:50.240 --> 37:52.880
Perhaps we should discuss this after
you've been home to rest.

37:52.880 --> 37:54.680
Well, it's hardly a leap!

37:54.680 --> 37:56.960
If Frank Napier's behind this,
you can't blame me

37:56.960 --> 37:59.280
for wondering if you are too.
Both of you.

37:59.280 --> 38:01.280
Steady the fuck on.

38:01.280 --> 38:03.440
A Police Detective is dead.

38:03.440 --> 38:05.120
Two firearms officers.

38:05.120 --> 38:07.840
Patrick wasn't meant to be
a target, though, was he?

38:07.840 --> 38:10.120
He got caught in the crossfire
and became a witness.

38:10.120 --> 38:11.560
I'm sure no-one wanted him dead.

38:11.560 --> 38:13.920
But it wouldn't be the first time
Frank Napier sacrificed

38:13.920 --> 38:15.880
British life for the sake of
Correction,

38:15.880 --> 38:18.240
and it wouldn't be the first time
you failed to stop him.

38:18.240 --> 38:19.440
That is enough!

38:19.440 --> 38:21.920
Hannah Roberts was an enemy of
the British State.

38:27.480 --> 38:28.840
I need to know.

38:31.360 --> 38:33.560
If this is a plot between us
and the CIA

38:33.560 --> 38:35.840
to steer UK government away
from Chinese tech

38:35.840 --> 38:37.480
then I need to know,

38:37.480 --> 38:41.000
because at least then
Patrick died for a reason.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.680
I do understand.

38:42.680 --> 38:43.840
If, if...

38:43.840 --> 38:47.360
If Beijing gets a stake in UK
facial recognition it could amount

38:47.360 --> 38:49.320
to a permanent security breach.

38:49.320 --> 38:52.200
If we're not trying to stop
that deal, we should be.

38:52.200 --> 38:54.000
As hard as it is to take,

38:54.000 --> 38:56.680
I understand if DS Flynn
became collateral.

38:58.680 --> 39:00.160
It's national security.

39:01.480 --> 39:02.880
Well, ah...

39:04.040 --> 39:06.840
..as rousing as that was,

39:06.840 --> 39:08.360
you couldn't be more wrong.

39:08.360 --> 39:10.240
We're as much in the dark
as you are.

39:10.240 --> 39:13.240
I seriously doubt Frank Napier
has a hand in the seventh floor,

39:13.240 --> 39:14.800
but if he does he's on his own.

39:14.800 --> 39:16.880
He's a rogue player.
Always has been.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.320
Where did you see him exactly?

39:19.800 --> 39:22.280
He was on the ground floor.

39:24.080 --> 39:26.400
I don't know if this was just
for my benefit, but...

39:26.400 --> 39:27.920
So he saw you?

39:27.920 --> 39:30.800
He acted like he was here
for something.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.680
Radiology was the department.

39:35.040 --> 39:38.040
For God's sake, Rachel, the man had
an appointment in Radiology.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.920
I'm sure we can verify?

39:41.920 --> 39:44.040
I'll deal with Frank. KNOCK AT DOOR

39:47.280 --> 39:48.400
Minister.

39:48.400 --> 39:49.640
Are you OK?

39:49.640 --> 39:51.320
No, I'm fine.

39:51.320 --> 39:55.560
So I saw two men fleeing the
hospital in a grey Mercedes van.

39:55.560 --> 39:58.480
Ah, GX66 AEE.

39:58.480 --> 40:01.000
Sorry, this is all very helpful,
but would you mind telling me

40:01.000 --> 40:03.160
what the hell you were doing here
in the first place?

40:03.160 --> 40:04.320
I insisted.

40:04.320 --> 40:06.760
It's a miracle you didn't get shot.

40:06.760 --> 40:08.480
We'll get you to CTC,

40:08.480 --> 40:09.760
take a full statement.

40:09.760 --> 40:12.040
No, I'm sorry.
I haven't got the time.

40:12.040 --> 40:14.080
The Home Secretary has asked
to see me, so...

40:15.600 --> 40:17.040
Flynn?

40:25.040 --> 40:26.280
I'm sorry.

40:30.440 --> 40:31.920
Did you get a look at them?

40:31.920 --> 40:34.200
Yes. They were both wearing
scrubs and face masks.

40:34.200 --> 40:37.040
Well, I could see they were
both white males, medium build.

40:37.040 --> 40:39.480
I'd say one was in
the region of six foot.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.800
The other was smaller, about 5'10.

40:41.800 --> 40:43.360
Start processing hospital staff

40:43.360 --> 40:45.400
for anyone matching
that description.

40:46.520 --> 40:48.520
Detective?

40:48.520 --> 40:50.680
Ah, sorry. I, erm...

40:50.680 --> 40:53.680
I think you're right.
I do need to rest.

40:53.680 --> 40:55.760
I'll be in in the morning.

40:55.760 --> 40:59.040
The shock you've had,
you'll need longer than that.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.480
Consider it compassionate leave.

41:01.480 --> 41:04.480
We'll discuss timeline
in due course.

41:04.480 --> 41:06.520
Thanks, ma'am.

41:06.520 --> 41:08.080
Sir.

42:05.120 --> 42:08.440
Well, it seems you've had
quite the night.

42:08.440 --> 42:11.760
First you book yourself on the BBC
without consulting me,

42:11.760 --> 42:13.920
McKenzie, or anyone
in the press department.

42:13.920 --> 42:18.240
You sanction the arrest of
a foreign national whose only

42:18.240 --> 42:23.320
apparent wrongdoing seems to
be catching a ride home?

42:23.320 --> 42:26.360
And then you get yourself
pulled over by the police for

42:26.360 --> 42:28.840
speeding in a car that isn't yours.

42:28.840 --> 42:31.840
Yes. I backed the arrest
of Yan Wanglei.

42:33.200 --> 42:35.640
Now I realise the police were
looking in the wrong place

42:35.640 --> 42:38.480
but there was a major
security threat.

42:38.480 --> 42:40.440
At the time it seemed like
the right decision.

42:40.440 --> 42:42.000
It wasn't your decision to make.

42:42.000 --> 42:46.000
Well, honestly, I was concerned
if you or the PM had to make

42:46.000 --> 42:47.920
a call on China, you would buckle.

42:47.920 --> 42:49.120
Really?

42:54.040 --> 42:56.000
Isaac, you're a clever lad.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.160
You've seen the reaction
to Newsnight.

42:58.160 --> 43:00.160
You know where this is going.

43:00.160 --> 43:01.840
I've spoken to the PM.

43:01.840 --> 43:04.640
Sorry, no, I don't know
where this is going.

43:04.640 --> 43:08.360
You sat on TV and said you were
in favour of racial profiling.

43:08.360 --> 43:09.680
What?

43:09.680 --> 43:10.880
There's no other option.

43:10.880 --> 43:12.040
I didn't say it.

43:12.040 --> 43:13.920
You did. I was watching
and I heard you.

43:13.920 --> 43:15.600
Rowan, you know
what's happening here.

43:15.600 --> 43:17.800
They're hacking my interviews
and changing my words.

43:17.800 --> 43:21.000
Maybe it's not China, but...
You're not listening to me.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.240
People heard it.

43:22.240 --> 43:23.560
Now it's real.

43:30.920 --> 43:33.200
Welcome to the nightmare
that is Correction, Isaac.

43:34.880 --> 43:38.920
Now, our enemies fake things
that we can't deny.

43:38.920 --> 43:40.400
Proof is impossible.

43:40.400 --> 43:43.000
Denial without proof is pointless.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.280
And, worst of all,

43:44.280 --> 43:46.880
if we do ever prove it or deny it
we are fucked.

43:46.880 --> 43:48.080
Why?

43:48.080 --> 43:50.480
You know why. We're as guilty
of it as they are!

43:52.120 --> 43:54.920
You heard those Intelligence spods.

43:56.320 --> 43:59.760
If Correction unravels...

43:59.760 --> 44:02.400
..then Counter Terrorism,
the courts,

44:02.400 --> 44:04.840
the Justice Department,
all unravels with it,

44:04.840 --> 44:05.960
across the whole world.

44:05.960 --> 44:08.000
And it is worse in democracies

44:08.000 --> 44:13.000
because we can't muzzle our judges
or our media like China

44:13.000 --> 44:16.560
or Russia, or whoever the hell
did this.

44:18.480 --> 44:22.320
Home Secretary, I'm not apologising
for something I didn't say.

44:22.320 --> 44:24.960
This has gone way beyond an apology.

44:27.760 --> 44:29.440
You want me to resign.

44:30.600 --> 44:34.240
McKenzie reckons it plays better
if we make the first move.

44:37.680 --> 44:40.160
You're sacking me.

44:40.160 --> 44:42.360
We won't forget this.

44:42.360 --> 44:45.920
Right? You just...
You need to just spend a...

44:45.920 --> 44:49.200
..a little time in purgatory.
That's all.

44:49.200 --> 44:51.440
Until you get...  My second chance.

44:55.720 --> 44:57.400
It's nothing personal.

45:29.440 --> 45:31.120
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

45:31.120 --> 45:35.000
I didn't know. The whole time
I thought I was getting updates.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.080
You're not the only one.

45:37.080 --> 45:39.240
And DS Flynn, did anyone see...

45:41.200 --> 45:42.960
Not here, Detective.

45:44.400 --> 45:46.240
Not now.

45:46.240 --> 45:48.920
What have you got for me, ma'am?

45:48.920 --> 45:51.640
The first thing you need to do
is hand over all phones and comms.

45:51.640 --> 45:53.040
You'll be issued replacements

45:53.040 --> 45:55.760
as soon as we can guarantee
they're secure.

45:55.760 --> 45:57.000
Ma'am.

46:01.720 --> 46:03.360
I do have something for you.

46:07.040 --> 46:08.480
We'll talk.

46:34.920 --> 46:36.440
SHE GASPS

46:53.000 --> 46:55.040
KEYS JANGLE

47:25.560 --> 47:27.760
Oh, for fuck's sake.

47:27.760 --> 47:29.920
Finally! Is this what time
you finish?

47:32.920 --> 47:35.160
Why are you here?

47:35.160 --> 47:36.400
I called you.

47:36.400 --> 47:37.840
I need to sleep over.

47:37.840 --> 47:39.920
You said I could come stay
any time, so...

47:39.920 --> 47:41.160
Look, Abigail, this is...

47:42.680 --> 47:44.840
This is a bad time, OK?

47:44.840 --> 47:47.800
I can't choose when Mum and Dad
go on a city break.

47:47.800 --> 47:50.680
What, and you can't be in
the house alone?

47:50.680 --> 47:52.000
I won't sleep.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.320
You weren't sleeping here.

47:53.320 --> 47:54.680
I was waiting up for you.

47:54.680 --> 47:57.200
Are you making tea?
I couldn't find any oat milk.

47:57.200 --> 47:59.160
If you don't have oat milk,
I'll do without.

47:59.160 --> 48:00.960
The milk, I mean, not tea.

48:00.960 --> 48:02.040
I'll have tea.

48:02.040 --> 48:04.000
I've got tonnes I need to talk
to you about.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.280
I'm starting a podcast.

48:06.280 --> 48:08.000
Why don't we talk about it tomorrow?

48:08.000 --> 48:09.440
SHE UNCORKS BOTTLE

48:11.160 --> 48:13.720
Don't worry. I'll sleep
now you're here.

48:13.720 --> 48:16.000
It's been like this since
the burglary, which is weird

48:16.000 --> 48:19.800
cos that happened in the daytime
and I wasn't even home.

48:19.800 --> 48:22.080
The only way I can get to sleep
by myself these days

48:22.080 --> 48:23.720
is when I vape weed,

48:23.720 --> 48:26.840
but then I just wake up at three
in the morning with anxiety.

48:28.240 --> 48:29.760
Is this whisky?

48:29.760 --> 48:31.240
What did you just say?

48:32.400 --> 48:34.040
I vape weed?

48:35.000 --> 48:36.560
Sorry, are you going to arrest me?

48:36.560 --> 48:38.280
What burglary?

48:38.280 --> 48:39.760
The burglary.

48:39.760 --> 48:41.600
I thought Dad would've told you.

48:41.600 --> 48:43.480
When was this?

48:43.480 --> 48:46.320
I don't know. Months ago.

48:46.320 --> 48:48.760
You were burgled months ago
and nobody told me?

48:48.760 --> 48:50.120
I'm a police detective.

48:50.120 --> 48:52.240
Well, Dad probably didn't
want to bother you.

48:52.240 --> 48:53.800
We all know how busy you are.

48:53.800 --> 48:55.000
What did they take?

48:55.000 --> 48:57.240
Not a lot. They turned
the whole place over

48:57.240 --> 49:01.440
but they only took my iPad,
Mum's laptop...

49:01.440 --> 49:02.840
Where are you going?  I just...

49:02.840 --> 49:05.000
Ah, I'll be back soon.
Just get some sleep.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.440
Wait. Did they get an alarm?

49:06.440 --> 49:08.440
Huh?  After the burglary,
did Dad get an alarm?

49:08.440 --> 49:09.520
Yes.

49:09.520 --> 49:10.680
What's the code?

49:10.680 --> 49:12.000
My birthday.

49:13.800 --> 49:16.360
You're going to have to tell me
the numbers, Abigail.

49:19.760 --> 49:22.080
Isaac Turner has been sacked
from his role as

49:22.080 --> 49:24.120
Home Office Security Minister,

49:24.120 --> 49:27.240
following comments he made
during a BBC interview

49:27.240 --> 49:29.000
about racial profiling.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.920
VOICE OF ISAAC:  The truth is,
racial profiling is what makes Xanda

49:32.920 --> 49:35.160
the most effective security system
in the world.

49:35.160 --> 49:37.880
Ah, could you, erm...
Could you turn it off?

49:37.880 --> 49:41.000
Huh?  Just turn it off, please.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.560
VOLUME INCREASES:  I'm not saying
this is the case but if, say...  OK?

49:43.560 --> 49:45.520
No, no, no. I...
..Muslim men between the ages of

49:45.520 --> 49:47.920
17 and 35 were the most likely to...
Don't worry. It's fine.

49:47.920 --> 49:50.080
..launch an attack on an airport...
Yes, thank you.

49:50.080 --> 49:52.040
..what's wrong with a system
that factors that in?

49:52.040 --> 49:54.560
Minister, are you suggesting
the programme uses

49:54.560 --> 49:57.120
racial bias deliberately?

50:01.120 --> 50:04.680
ALARM BEEPS

50:15.640 --> 50:18.040
DETECTOR BEEPS

50:55.920 --> 50:58.960
SHE GASPS FOR BREATH

51:15.440 --> 51:18.000
SHE SOBS

51:31.760 --> 51:33.800
INDISTINCT SHOUTING

51:36.840 --> 51:39.040
DRIVER: Here, or you want
to go back?

51:39.960 --> 51:41.720
Back in time, if you could.

51:46.240 --> 51:48.360
I think you are right.

51:48.360 --> 51:49.800
I'm sorry?

51:51.800 --> 51:53.880
You have to protect people.

52:04.200 --> 52:06.840
Are you going to resign as MP,
Mr Turner?

52:06.840 --> 52:08.960
Why should your Muslim
constituents vote for you?

52:08.960 --> 52:11.720
Mr Turner, why won't you respond
to the love-child allegations

52:11.720 --> 52:13.280
made by Victoria Bello?

52:26.480 --> 52:29.080
There are Black Lives Matter
protesters out there.

52:32.600 --> 52:36.880
I don't think...  Outside my house,
protesting against my husband,

52:36.880 --> 52:39.200
who, last time I saw him,
was black.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.200
I'm still black, Simmy.

52:44.120 --> 52:45.800
Why did you say those things?

52:50.240 --> 52:52.120
Where are you going?

52:52.120 --> 52:53.720
I asked you a question.

52:53.720 --> 52:55.720
Did someone put a gun to your head?

52:55.720 --> 52:56.920
Where's my laptop?

52:56.920 --> 52:58.160
Where's your laptop?!

52:58.160 --> 53:00.640
I've been waiting to speak to you
since 11 o'clock last night.

53:00.640 --> 53:01.920
Yes. I need it.

53:02.920 --> 53:04.880
I know there are things
you have to say, Isaac.

53:04.880 --> 53:07.600
I've sat through enough party
conferences watching you clapping

53:07.600 --> 53:10.000
like a fucking seal for ministers
you don't like,

53:10.000 --> 53:12.160
for policies you don't truly
believe in,

53:12.160 --> 53:15.400
government stances that don't always
reflect who you are,

53:15.400 --> 53:16.600
who we are.

53:17.520 --> 53:19.560
But racial fucking profiling?

53:22.520 --> 53:24.040
I can't do this now.

53:27.200 --> 53:29.120
You can't talk to your wife?

53:29.120 --> 53:31.240
When I've spent all night,
all morning,

53:31.240 --> 53:34.120
wondering what the hell is going on,
worrying for you,

53:34.120 --> 53:35.560
telling Ruby everything's OK,

53:35.560 --> 53:37.760
that the people outside don't
want to hurt us,

53:37.760 --> 53:39.240
trying - unsuccessfully by the way -

53:39.240 --> 53:41.360
to keep Harrison away
from the TV?

53:42.480 --> 53:44.000
Yeah, that's right.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.760
So if you can't talk to me,

53:45.760 --> 53:48.400
then perhaps you'd at least like
to explain to our children

53:48.400 --> 53:50.640
why their daddy's being
called a racist.

53:50.640 --> 53:53.040
I certainly can't.

53:53.040 --> 53:54.920
I didn't.  What?

53:54.920 --> 53:56.520
Say those things.

53:56.520 --> 53:58.040
What does that mean?

54:14.320 --> 54:16.880
You promised you'd explain to me
when you got home.

54:16.880 --> 54:18.720
I said I'd explain when I can!

54:18.720 --> 54:20.440
Well, if not now, then when?

54:20.440 --> 54:21.920
In case you haven't noticed, Isaac,

54:21.920 --> 54:24.040
you've just lost your job in
government. It's over.

54:24.040 --> 54:26.360
No, it isn't!

54:26.360 --> 54:28.040
HE SLAMS DOOR

55:04.480 --> 55:06.120
If Frank Napier's behind this,

55:06.120 --> 55:08.280
you can't blame me for wondering
if you are too.

55:08.280 --> 55:09.760
Steady the fuck on.

55:09.760 --> 55:12.280
And it wouldn't be the first time
Frank Napier sacrificed

55:12.280 --> 55:14.120
British life for the sake
of Correction,

55:14.120 --> 55:16.360
and it wouldn't be the first time
you failed to stop him!

55:16.360 --> 55:17.440
That is enough!

55:17.440 --> 55:19.800
Hannah Roberts was an enemy of
the British State.

55:19.800 --> 55:21.760
SHE PAUSES CLIP

55:36.040 --> 55:39.680
Welcome to the nightmare that
is Correction, Isaac.

55:39.680 --> 55:43.440
Our enemies fake things
which we can't deny.

55:43.440 --> 55:46.920
Proof is impossible. Denial
without proof is pointless.

55:46.920 --> 55:50.000
And, worst of all, if we do ever
prove it or deny it

55:50.000 --> 55:51.600
we are fucked.  Why?

55:51.600 --> 55:54.440
You know why. We're as guilty of it
as they are!
