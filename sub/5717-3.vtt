WEBVTT

00:03.681 --> 00:05.915
I... apologize.

00:05.971 --> 00:09.252
I did not wish to... injure.

00:10.752 --> 00:13.311
Have you told Rene? About the baby?

00:13.312 --> 00:15.442
I can't.
Why not?

00:15.457 --> 00:16.936
Because the baby can't be his.

00:16.937 --> 00:19.056
George must never know.

00:19.057 --> 00:23.656
The only thing you need, to make
you unbeatable, is the right wife.

00:23.657 --> 00:26.576
George is having a second chance,
and you're taking yours.

00:26.577 --> 00:28.496
I thought perhaps
I might follow suit.

00:28.497 --> 00:30.176
So you'll be leaving Ash Park.

00:30.177 --> 00:32.216
If that's what George wants.

00:32.217 --> 00:35.576
We do hope you'll do us the honour
of being Georgie's godparents.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.336
Oh, my goodness!
No, we can't.

00:37.337 --> 00:38.577
We thought that...

00:38.577 --> 00:40.056
We're Catholic.

00:40.057 --> 00:41.696
All because of James?

00:41.697 --> 00:43.857
It's not natural what he is.
It goes against God.

00:44.897 --> 00:46.417
Rene?

00:49.177 --> 00:51.056
Quick! I need help!

00:51.057 --> 00:53.977
I can't have this baby.
I don't want it.

00:53.977 --> 00:55.737
You running away from home, missy?

00:55.738 --> 00:57.377
Aunt Peg isn't well.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074

01:20.177 --> 01:22.736
I'm off to the shops.
Do you want anything?

01:22.737 --> 01:23.937
I'll do the shopping.

01:23.937 --> 01:26.296
I've just had a stroke, love.
I'm not a cripple.

01:26.297 --> 01:28.576
And I am still on the ball.

01:28.577 --> 01:30.457
At least I think I am.

01:30.457 --> 01:33.097
I just have to find my keys.

01:38.297 --> 01:40.816
Well, then I'm not
making myself clear.

01:40.817 --> 01:43.897
I just need you to confirm this is a
registered medical doctor's surgery,

01:43.897 --> 01:45.217
before I make an ap...

01:54.017 --> 01:57.336
Well, would you mind telling me
where the doctor's practising now?

01:57.337 --> 02:02.177
Yes, I understand, but do you
know where the doctor's moved to?

02:03.817 --> 02:05.136
Well, is there anyone else

02:05.137 --> 02:07.057
that you can refer me to
who might be able to...

02:09.817 --> 02:13.816
Yes, so her intravenous just
needs to stay in another day.

02:13.817 --> 02:15.696
I think that's it. OK, bye.

02:15.697 --> 02:17.296
Here, let me.

02:17.297 --> 02:19.497
Oh! You can stay as long as you like.

02:22.377 --> 02:26.976
Next door pays for their telephone
calls, you certainly don't.

02:26.977 --> 02:29.336
Well, they don't either
half the time.

02:29.337 --> 02:31.496
Aunt Peg...
Don't "Aunt Peg" me.

02:31.497 --> 02:34.656
But you have been on the blower
quite a lot. It must be exhausting.

02:34.657 --> 02:37.576
Any luck finding a surgeon?

02:37.577 --> 02:41.056
Oh, I s'pose it must be
a very specialised field,

02:41.057 --> 02:43.256
that sort of brain operation.

02:43.257 --> 02:44.776
Yes. Yes, it is.

02:44.777 --> 02:47.256
Oh, have you spoken
to Rene this morning?

02:47.257 --> 02:48.936
Yes, he's much better. Much.

02:48.937 --> 02:50.776
And George? Any news?

02:50.777 --> 02:53.096
They tell me he's making
excellent progress.

02:53.097 --> 02:54.936
It was a terrible thing to happen,

02:54.937 --> 02:58.536
but from what you've told me,
it could have been a lot worse.

02:58.537 --> 03:00.136
When all's said and done,

03:00.137 --> 03:02.377
George is a very lucky man.

03:07.577 --> 03:09.416
And how is he this morning?

03:09.417 --> 03:12.776
Last heard boasting he'd had
a long walk before breakfast.

03:12.777 --> 03:14.296
That's very good news.

03:14.297 --> 03:15.576
And baby George?

03:15.577 --> 03:17.776
Currently reading
the morning paper out loud,

03:17.777 --> 03:19.176
in ancient Greek, I believe.

03:19.177 --> 03:20.896
I am smiling.

03:20.897 --> 03:23.256
And Dr Nordmann? Any news?

03:23.257 --> 03:25.776
I suppose the poor man
is still under close supervision.

03:25.777 --> 03:28.456
Jack's taken responsibility
for watching over him.

03:28.457 --> 03:30.736
Jack takes on too much.

03:30.737 --> 03:32.456
Well, Sarah had to go to Sydney.

03:32.457 --> 03:34.776
Oh, really? Oh, do you know why?

03:34.777 --> 03:37.096
Uh, her Aunt Peg's unwell.

03:37.097 --> 03:39.256
Sorry, Mother, I might
have to go in a tick.

03:39.257 --> 03:40.776
So do I.

03:40.777 --> 03:44.736
But speaking of time,
that clock radio contraption of yours

03:44.737 --> 03:48.256
has proved rather a challenge,
but I think I've managed to tame it.

03:48.257 --> 03:50.096
I thought it was a two-day wonder.

03:50.097 --> 03:52.337
Oh, I told you you'd
enjoy waking up to music.

03:52.338 --> 03:54.817
The instruction booklet
was incomprehensible, of course.

03:54.817 --> 03:56.657
I've written a letter
to the manufacturers.

03:57.697 --> 03:59.976
Anything else you need help with?

03:59.977 --> 04:02.856
No, no. Nothing at all.

04:02.857 --> 04:04.896
Bye-bye, dear.
I've enjoyed the chat.

04:04.897 --> 04:06.457
Bye.

04:30.977 --> 04:32.417
Thank you.

04:34.537 --> 04:36.537
So, what brings you to Sydney?

04:37.817 --> 04:39.816
To find a good surgeon
for my husband.

04:39.817 --> 04:41.776
Oh, I see.

04:41.777 --> 04:44.456
Carolyn mentioned
that your aunt's unwell.

04:44.457 --> 04:47.016
Yes, yes. That as well.

04:47.017 --> 04:49.576
Please do give her my best.
I shall include her in my prayers.

04:49.577 --> 04:50.736
I will.

04:50.737 --> 04:53.337
I'm so glad you agreed
to meet me, Sarah.

04:55.057 --> 04:58.936
I did apologise for my hasty reaction
at the hospital,

04:58.937 --> 05:00.817
but I must not
let myself off the hook.

05:02.017 --> 05:05.736
I truly regret treating you
so poorly in the past.

05:05.737 --> 05:07.296
Thank you, Elizabeth.

05:07.297 --> 05:10.536
I know that if it hadn't
been for your courage

05:10.537 --> 05:14.416
and your sharp thinking,
I might have lost George.

05:14.417 --> 05:17.056
Then again, if I hadn't
brought Rene back to Inverness,

05:17.057 --> 05:18.937
the accident
would never have happened.

05:23.537 --> 05:26.657
It's so sad for George that
your marriage didn't proceed.

05:27.737 --> 05:31.097
Marriage is, of course, about so
much more than just love, isn't it?

05:32.257 --> 05:34.576
For so many women since the war,

05:34.577 --> 05:38.056
their husband is no longer
the man they married.

05:38.057 --> 05:39.896
I feel for you.

05:39.897 --> 05:41.937
It's not an easy cross to bear.

05:41.938 --> 05:45.777
Oh, they say the two most
powerful healers are patience,

05:45.777 --> 05:47.577
and time.

05:50.817 --> 05:54.857
So, tell me how you're
settling into city life.

05:57.497 --> 05:59.536
It's very different.

05:59.537 --> 06:03.176
You know, when I left Ash Park,
I thanked you for the impetus to go.

06:03.177 --> 06:04.936
You were one of the very few people

06:04.937 --> 06:06.936
who truly understood
why I had to leave.

06:06.937 --> 06:08.656
I admired...

06:08.657 --> 06:10.816
Admire your courage.

06:10.817 --> 06:12.936
You know...

06:12.937 --> 06:15.376
I used to be disdainful of women

06:15.377 --> 06:19.137
who made their decisions
based on emotions.

06:20.177 --> 06:22.296
Feelings.

06:22.297 --> 06:24.096
But I'm coming to realise

06:24.097 --> 06:27.457
that feelings are not
necessarily to be ignored.

06:29.857 --> 06:34.456
Mind you, if my feelings
about the dreadful Regina Standish

06:34.457 --> 06:37.617
were ever allowed to surface,
heaven help us all.

06:38.777 --> 06:41.536
When in doubt, ask a busy person.

06:41.537 --> 06:44.376
I shouldn't have promised
Sir Richard a card party.

06:44.377 --> 06:46.296
You've got the christening
to rearrange,

06:46.297 --> 06:48.736
and now all these men
descending upon the house.

06:48.737 --> 06:51.336
I'll greet the chaps as they
arrive through the day, how's that?

06:51.337 --> 06:54.616
I think everything's
under control, but thank you.

06:54.617 --> 06:56.976
I'll ask the staff
to check the card tables.

06:56.977 --> 07:00.776
Moths do love felt.
That's been done. Thank you.

07:00.777 --> 07:02.816
Good cigars? Plenty of?

07:02.817 --> 07:06.936
I've done a few men's cards
parties in my time, that's all.

07:06.937 --> 07:12.536
Actually, our estate in England
was known for its games evenings.

07:12.537 --> 07:15.136
I can hear my mother's
instructions to the staff

07:15.137 --> 07:16.736
as if she were here beside me.

07:16.737 --> 07:19.216
And how satisfying
it is to be busy.

07:19.217 --> 07:21.456
The time just seems to fly,
don't you think?

07:21.457 --> 07:23.216
Always.

07:23.217 --> 07:24.576
Excuse me, Olivia.

07:24.577 --> 07:27.616
My artist friend, Lloyd, has written
to say that he's arriving tomorrow

07:27.617 --> 07:29.176
to start on your family portrait.

07:29.177 --> 07:30.616
On top of everything else, sorry.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.456
We'll just have to
make time, won't we?

07:33.457 --> 07:35.816
And room.
Good.

07:35.817 --> 07:37.376
I'll walk with you.

07:37.377 --> 07:40.497
How does this sound for
the supper menu?

07:44.217 --> 07:45.737
There you are.

07:47.137 --> 07:51.176
George, do we have any more
records to spare? Some jazz?

07:51.177 --> 07:54.616
Jack thinks some variety might
be therapeutic for Dr Nordmann.

07:54.617 --> 07:57.456
Yes, of course. Of course.
Thank you.

07:57.457 --> 07:58.857
Jack's a good man, isn't he?

08:00.377 --> 08:01.897
He is indeed.

08:03.657 --> 08:06.257
What?
Sit down for a moment.

08:10.297 --> 08:11.657
Is he...

08:12.697 --> 08:14.057
Is Jack...

08:15.097 --> 08:16.696
How do I put this?

08:16.697 --> 08:18.977
..Anna's natural father?

08:21.137 --> 08:22.176
Carolyn?

08:22.177 --> 08:23.697
Yes.

08:28.377 --> 08:30.017
Jack Duncan.

08:32.496 --> 08:38.696
When Anna was a baby, Elaine and I
would speculate who the father was,

08:38.697 --> 08:41.657
and why you would never tell us.

08:42.736 --> 08:47.097
Then... life takes over.
Anna was ours.

08:48.777 --> 08:50.856
How much does she know?

08:50.857 --> 08:53.297
She knows that I gave birth to her.

08:54.337 --> 08:56.536
And she knows about Jack.

08:56.537 --> 08:57.976
She put two and two
together, George.

08:57.977 --> 08:59.057
I had to tell her the truth.

08:59.057 --> 09:00.816
Does Jack now that he's her...

09:00.817 --> 09:02.456
Yes.

09:02.457 --> 09:06.056
I told him
not long before Anna realised.

09:06.057 --> 09:07.896
There was so much
going on for you and Sarah.

09:07.897 --> 09:09.777
I was... I was waiting
for the right time.

09:11.137 --> 09:12.537
Of course.

09:15.337 --> 09:18.257
So, what is the etiquette here?

09:20.857 --> 09:22.496
Should I speak with Jack,

09:22.497 --> 09:25.736
or would you like to ask Jack
if he'd like to speak with me?

09:25.737 --> 09:28.297
How does one share one's daughter?

09:29.857 --> 09:32.616
You are Anna's father, George.

09:32.617 --> 09:36.337
She thinks of you as her father,
and she loves you as her father.

09:37.417 --> 09:39.177
I hope that doesn't change.
Father.

09:40.577 --> 09:42.496
Is now a good time
to talk about the ram figures?

09:42.497 --> 09:44.057
Of course.

09:46.057 --> 09:47.497
Aunt Carolyn.

09:49.057 --> 09:50.536
So, that's the greasy fleece weight,

09:50.537 --> 09:52.336
and that's the body weight,
and that's the wool type.

09:52.337 --> 09:55.256
350 guineas was the price
from a similar sale.

09:55.257 --> 09:57.817
Now, question is,
do we go that high?

09:57.817 --> 09:59.896
I have every faith in you.

09:59.897 --> 10:02.536
You've seen enough auctions.
You'll get the best price.

10:02.537 --> 10:04.096
Thanks, Father.

10:04.097 --> 10:09.017
But James, there's something
Carolyn and I need to tell you.

10:12.377 --> 10:15.896
I'm actually Anna's cousin.

10:15.897 --> 10:19.096
And, of course, that's why Jack
was best man at the wedding.

10:19.097 --> 10:22.176
It's... it's like something
out of one of Anna's novels.

10:22.177 --> 10:25.216
She's obviously
handled it all very well.

10:25.217 --> 10:26.697
I never guessed.

10:27.857 --> 10:29.097
Not once.

10:30.177 --> 10:33.337
I remember when my parents
brought Anna home as a baby,

10:33.338 --> 10:35.736
and my mother putting her
in my arms.

10:35.737 --> 10:39.057
And she said,
"This is your little sister."

10:39.057 --> 10:41.577
She still is, James.

10:44.137 --> 10:46.016
Oh! Oh!

10:46.017 --> 10:47.537
I'll take him.

10:50.057 --> 10:52.056
Hello, Georgie.

10:52.057 --> 10:53.897
Georgie Porgie.

10:55.217 --> 10:57.136
They can all keep a secret,
that's for sure.

10:57.137 --> 10:59.097
Can't they, Georgie?

11:00.137 --> 11:02.496
From a good place, though.

11:02.497 --> 11:04.417
Not wanting to hurt each other.

11:04.418 --> 11:07.497
The most important thing, I think,

11:07.497 --> 11:11.616
is that your parents loved Anna
as if she were their own.

11:11.617 --> 11:13.896
Ooh.

11:13.897 --> 11:16.776
I think...
I think he needs a change.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.456
Can you...

11:18.457 --> 11:20.016
Sorry.

11:20.017 --> 11:24.537
One day,
I will show you how to do it.

11:29.337 --> 11:31.976
Mind you, what if she
had never been told?

11:31.977 --> 11:34.297
Or worse still,
found out accidentally?

11:36.057 --> 11:38.857
All's well that ends well,
I suppose.

11:43.057 --> 11:45.257
Shh, shh.

11:49.697 --> 11:51.177
Hello!

11:52.497 --> 11:54.536
Look at you riding.

11:54.537 --> 11:55.777
Does your doctor know?

11:57.057 --> 11:58.776
No, he doesn't.

11:58.777 --> 12:01.097
And you're not about to tell him.

12:05.497 --> 12:07.697
Carolyn and I
had a talk this morning.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.416
Are you cross with me?

12:12.417 --> 12:13.656
Father...

12:13.657 --> 12:16.576
I know some people tell
their children. Why didn't we?

12:16.577 --> 12:19.296
As I said to Carolyn,
you always seemed so carefree.

12:19.297 --> 12:22.376
And I was yours.
Yours and Mother's.

12:22.377 --> 12:23.977
I still am.

12:28.657 --> 12:29.856
George.

12:29.857 --> 12:31.417
Gino.

12:33.017 --> 12:35.656
Father knows that I know.

12:35.657 --> 12:38.256
And about Jack.
Is everything OK?

12:38.257 --> 12:42.256
My greatest hope, truly,
is that nothing changes between us.

12:42.257 --> 12:43.896
There's no chance of that.

12:43.897 --> 12:46.856
And please, you're both welcome
in Ash Park, any time.

12:46.857 --> 12:48.696
Thank you, Father.

12:48.697 --> 12:51.376
I'll be over this
afternoon to ride Stardust.

12:51.377 --> 12:53.256
You should bring her down here.

12:53.257 --> 12:57.376
Can you imagine Stardust sleeping
in that draughty old barn?

12:57.377 --> 12:59.897
But we're going to fix it up,
and then she can.

13:02.257 --> 13:05.016
Take your father in
for a cold drink, huh?

13:05.017 --> 13:06.616
I'll just finish off with Carlo.

13:06.617 --> 13:08.296
Now, don't faint,

13:08.297 --> 13:12.696
but, um, I've made some
limonata, and panforte cake.

13:12.697 --> 13:14.536
It's like a cake.

13:14.537 --> 13:18.497
So, on top of everything else, my
daughter is turning into an Italiano?

13:25.857 --> 13:27.417
Grazie, Carlo.

13:28.497 --> 13:31.217
I should be back
before the end of the week.

13:32.457 --> 13:33.776
Yes.

13:33.777 --> 13:35.217
OK. Thanks, Jack.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.376
I'm just popping out for a while.
I won't be long.

13:40.377 --> 13:43.176
Sarah?
Anything you need?

13:43.177 --> 13:48.337
When Mrs Bligh called earlier, she
seemed to know that I'd been unwell.

13:48.337 --> 13:51.936
I get the sense that I'm an excuse.

13:51.937 --> 13:53.617
Well, I have been concerned
about you since...

13:53.617 --> 13:56.977
You didn't really come down
to look for a surgeon for Rene.

13:59.097 --> 14:01.816
Well, there's a health matter
of mine I need to attend to.

14:01.817 --> 14:04.856
It's nothing. Really.
I'll be as right as rain.

14:04.857 --> 14:06.737
I just need to find my purse.

14:09.737 --> 14:13.897
I know I'm an old lady, but I
didn't come down in the last shower.

14:15.977 --> 14:18.177
Are you expecting, love?
Is that it?

14:19.617 --> 14:21.417
Are you and the baby healthy?

14:24.937 --> 14:26.736
That's all that matters.

14:26.737 --> 14:28.496
Everything else can be solved.

14:28.497 --> 14:30.297
Sit down.

14:31.657 --> 14:33.857
How far gone are you?

14:34.977 --> 14:36.737
Nearly three months.

14:36.737 --> 14:40.336
Well, I will do everything I can
to help you and Rene.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.016
It won't be easy, I know.

14:42.017 --> 14:44.296
He has a long way to go before...
you know, all that.

14:44.297 --> 14:45.737
Peg, it isn't...

14:48.057 --> 14:50.017
The baby isn't Rene's.

14:55.137 --> 14:56.736
It's George's.

14:56.737 --> 14:59.096
Oh, my dear godfather.

14:59.097 --> 15:01.296
Did... Did you and George...

15:01.297 --> 15:03.776
Oh, well, yes you did.
Look, I know I'm old-fashioned but...

15:03.777 --> 15:07.176
Sorry. You don't need me
going crook on you.

15:07.177 --> 15:09.417
The thing is
that I need to face facts.

15:11.817 --> 15:14.097
Rene may take years
to recover fully.

15:14.097 --> 15:16.576
He'll probably never
practise medicine again.

15:16.577 --> 15:18.017
Well, he can find some
other employment.

15:18.017 --> 15:20.376
I can't be a mother
and a nursing sister.

15:20.377 --> 15:22.016
Don't... don't...

15:22.017 --> 15:25.257
Don't adopt this baby
out to strangers, please.

15:26.297 --> 15:28.057
This could be your last chance.

15:28.057 --> 15:29.937
You will regret it
for the rest of your life.

15:31.497 --> 15:33.176
I'll take it.

15:33.177 --> 15:36.137
I'll look after it until you're...
until you're ready.

15:36.137 --> 15:37.816
I can. I will.
Peg...

15:37.817 --> 15:40.656
Please.
Please, don't adopt out this baby.

15:40.657 --> 15:43.096
I have thought about this
long and hard,

15:43.097 --> 15:44.736
but I can't go through with it.

15:44.737 --> 15:47.176
I...I need to find a doctor.

15:47.177 --> 15:48.496
No.

15:48.497 --> 15:51.176
Oh, no, no, you're going to say
what I think you're going to say.

15:51.177 --> 15:53.056
If I thought there
was an alternative...

15:53.057 --> 15:54.576
Adopt it out, then. Do that.

15:54.577 --> 15:56.736
Give joy to a couple
who can't have a child.

15:56.737 --> 15:58.576
I have to work!
George will help you.

15:58.577 --> 16:00.136
He can never know.

16:00.137 --> 16:02.056
I can't have this baby, Peg.

16:02.057 --> 16:04.136
All the times I've stood up for you.

16:04.137 --> 16:06.216
Don't think I haven't
agonised over this!

16:06.217 --> 16:08.856
You are carrying a child.

16:08.857 --> 16:11.416
I could never forgive you this.

16:11.417 --> 16:14.736
No matter all the terrible things
you went through, this is...

16:14.737 --> 16:16.256
I can't even look at you.

16:16.257 --> 16:18.216
Aunt Peg, please!

16:18.217 --> 16:20.256
Peg!
No, no, no, no. No.

16:20.257 --> 16:22.497
I don't even know who you are.
Please! No!

17:08.666 --> 17:10.626
The physical symptoms are
difficult to deal with.

17:10.627 --> 17:12.946
It is hard, yes.
When I...

17:14.107 --> 17:17.587
When I had my... dark times...

17:19.089 --> 17:23.409
I'd try to place myself way back
to the person I was before the war,

17:23.409 --> 17:25.488
so that I wasn't defined by it.

17:25.489 --> 17:27.169
Focus on a happier time.

17:28.409 --> 17:30.089
A student in Paris.

17:30.089 --> 17:31.768
That must have been...

17:31.769 --> 17:35.848
Well, I can't even imagine that.
So much music, and parties.

17:35.849 --> 17:38.169
Life.
There you are.

17:38.169 --> 17:41.569
Because, while we need to address
the underlying physical problems,

17:41.570 --> 17:42.900
there's also the psychological...

17:42.901 --> 17:44.568
Sarah. Where is Sarah? Where?

17:44.569 --> 17:47.489
She's still in Sydney.
She left yesterday.

17:50.209 --> 17:52.648
You have told me this, yes?

17:52.649 --> 17:56.088
Yes, Dr Nordmann.
Each time you ask.

17:56.089 --> 17:57.729
More than ten?

17:59.609 --> 18:01.848
Do I ask more than 20 times?

18:01.849 --> 18:03.649
No.

18:04.729 --> 18:06.448
I improve.

18:06.449 --> 18:08.569
Improvement.

18:08.569 --> 18:10.248
Dr Duncan?

18:10.249 --> 18:11.968
Mrs Timbs is waiting
on her medication,

18:11.969 --> 18:13.649
and a trunk call for Dr Nordmann.

18:18.089 --> 18:19.529
Rene?

18:25.089 --> 18:26.449
Parlez moi.

18:33.969 --> 18:35.768
Uh, it's me.

18:35.769 --> 18:37.249
How is he, Jack?

18:37.249 --> 18:39.448
He was good this morning.

18:39.449 --> 18:40.929
I see.

18:40.929 --> 18:43.009
Everything alright there?

18:55.289 --> 18:56.649
Hello.

19:01.209 --> 19:04.888
See, if I had this every lunchtime,
I'd fly through the afternoons.

19:04.889 --> 19:08.289
Oh. Imagine how you'd
go if you had dessert.

19:12.849 --> 19:14.848
George knows.

19:14.849 --> 19:16.009
About Anna.

19:17.089 --> 19:18.688
Really?
It's good.

19:18.689 --> 19:20.089
He's pleased that it's you.

19:21.129 --> 19:22.569
And Anna?

19:22.569 --> 19:24.129
George has spoken with her,

19:24.130 --> 19:26.329
and he said that
he would like to talk with you.

19:27.489 --> 19:29.088
Alright.

19:29.089 --> 19:30.329
Good.

19:35.909 --> 19:37.688
Did you happen to see
that 'Weekly's article?

19:37.689 --> 19:40.128
Oh, yes. Didn't Her Majesty
look simply charming?

19:40.129 --> 19:41.888
And the duke - so handsome!

19:41.889 --> 19:43.728
Order, please. Order!

19:43.729 --> 19:46.688
Now, ladies, as we all know,

19:46.689 --> 19:50.689
this year's ball is in aid
of Mr Goddard's soup kitchen.

19:50.800 --> 19:51.959
Refuge.

19:51.960 --> 19:53.640
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Goddard.

19:53.640 --> 19:56.079
Returned Soldiers Refuge.

19:56.080 --> 20:00.039
Which will soon
have a much healthier bank account,

20:00.040 --> 20:04.159
with Mrs Bligh having recently
joined the committee.

20:04.160 --> 20:05.479
Thank you.

20:05.480 --> 20:08.479
Mrs Bligh has to only
wave her magic wand

20:08.480 --> 20:11.239
and the well-heeled
open their chequebooks.

20:11.240 --> 20:12.879
Oh, that's not entirely true.

20:12.880 --> 20:16.000
I look forward
to seeing Mrs Bligh in action.

20:18.120 --> 20:20.319
Patrons respond
to first-rate entertainment.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.880
My point, and I would
like this minuted, please,

20:22.881 --> 20:26.080
is that a lower budget
for decor and the band

20:26.080 --> 20:28.640
would have a significant effect
on funds raised.

20:28.641 --> 20:32.640
I note the figure,
final cost for last year,

20:32.640 --> 20:35.239
page three of the annual report.

20:35.240 --> 20:37.400
Surely far higher
than strictly necessary.

20:39.760 --> 20:44.119
So, we've decided on a
Hollywood theme for the decor.

20:44.120 --> 20:46.039
Do keep a note
of your tasks, please.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.719
We signed the Treaty of Versailles

20:47.720 --> 20:49.599
quicker than we
got to that conclusion.

20:49.600 --> 20:52.479
And for music, Sammy's Big
Band is our first choice.

20:52.480 --> 20:53.879
I'm going to contact them.

20:53.880 --> 20:57.839
Prudence, please, only if Mr Sammy
is prepared to lower his fee.

20:57.840 --> 21:01.079
A good five-piece ensemble will
still have people on their feet.

21:01.080 --> 21:04.119
The object of the game
is to raise money, not spend it.

21:04.120 --> 21:05.959
I'm with Mrs B.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.479
Very true.

21:07.480 --> 21:08.879
However, as we've heard,

21:08.880 --> 21:11.200
there's strong competition
this fundraising season.

21:11.201 --> 21:13.200
We need to promise
them a good bash,

21:13.200 --> 21:15.360
and I do so love a big band.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.239
One would expect as
much from a bureaucrat.

21:24.240 --> 21:25.679
Thank you.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.680
Excuse me a minute.
Of course.

21:30.640 --> 21:32.000
Thank you.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.520
We're on the same team,
you and I, Mrs Bligh.

21:37.920 --> 21:39.599
People don't need
bells and whistles

21:39.600 --> 21:41.319
and big bands to cough up.

21:41.320 --> 21:43.279
They either support
these diggers or they don't.

21:43.280 --> 21:45.479
It must be very satisfying,
Mr Goddard,

21:45.480 --> 21:46.999
helping the men as you do.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.959
Well, why don't you
come and have a look?

21:48.960 --> 21:51.119
You'd be the first of this lot.

21:51.120 --> 21:52.400
Why not?

21:53.480 --> 21:55.520
I'm afraid I don't have
the address, Mr Goddard.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.999
People often ask for the address.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.160
Not too many turn up.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.199
As long as you understand,
I couldn't tell you.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.759
Not until Father knew.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.479
I do understand.

22:17.480 --> 22:20.080
I just keep thinking how if Mother
and Father hadn't brought you in,

22:20.080 --> 22:22.080
I could have been spared
a little sister.

22:22.081 --> 22:23.280
You!

22:23.280 --> 22:24.599
You're still my big brother.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.720
You're still my irritating
little sister.

22:27.800 --> 22:31.279
My James is much too nice
to do that.

22:31.280 --> 22:33.319
Well, that wine took a while.

22:33.320 --> 22:36.479
Now come here and settle
something for me.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.999
I need your support.
Olivia doesn't believe me.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.119
He would never
have done such a thing.

22:41.120 --> 22:44.359
I was telling her about the time you
put Anna's favourite teddy bear

22:44.360 --> 22:46.679
on your billy cart
and sent it down the hill.

22:46.680 --> 22:48.399
No, no, no, no, that was her.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.199
I loved my teddies.
I never would have done that.

22:50.200 --> 22:52.119
You pushed them down
the steepest hill you could find.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.880
You sent it off a cliff
and then you blamed me.

22:53.880 --> 22:55.159
Remember when he did that?
James!

22:55.160 --> 22:57.279
I'd have to hear
testimony from the teddies.

22:57.280 --> 22:59.679
Calling Mr Teddy to the stand.

22:59.680 --> 23:02.959
Wasn't one of them named Felix?

23:02.960 --> 23:06.080
Yes, Mother named him Felix
because she liked the cartoon.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.399
Yes. Yes, she did.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.399
Miss.

23:10.400 --> 23:13.239
Little Georgie had quite a cry,
but he's asleep now.

23:13.240 --> 23:14.640
Thank you so much, Rose.

23:17.440 --> 23:19.120
Speaking of Georgie...

23:20.520 --> 23:24.159
We met with the reverend,
to discuss the christening,

23:24.160 --> 23:26.679
and you could both be witnesses.

23:26.680 --> 23:28.919
Can we please
stop talking about this?

23:28.920 --> 23:33.439
As Roman Catholics, it's against
our religion to be godparents

23:33.440 --> 23:35.439
to children who are not
of our faith,

23:35.440 --> 23:38.719
because we have to promise
to raise that child in our church.

23:38.720 --> 23:40.560
Same for you, if we had a baby.
I'm not being...

23:40.560 --> 23:43.040
Of course. Of course.

23:44.280 --> 23:46.680
Well, here's to a wonderful
family dinner.

23:46.681 --> 23:47.800
Thank you, Father.

24:05.240 --> 24:07.799
You were looking at James
strangely all night.

24:07.800 --> 24:09.760
I can't help it.

24:09.760 --> 24:11.599
It's unnatural.

24:11.600 --> 24:14.480
But they were holding hands.
They seemed happy.

24:14.481 --> 24:16.360
So, is he cured?

24:16.360 --> 24:18.200
He could be.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.639
And who are you being?
I made an experiment.

24:29.640 --> 24:32.039
It's good, huh?
It's lovely.

24:32.040 --> 24:35.040
Blackberry. With strong tannins.

24:36.200 --> 24:39.680
I sent the soil from
the west hill to be analysed.

24:40.760 --> 24:43.240
Very good soil.
Very good drainage, for...

24:43.240 --> 24:45.359
For cucumbers.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.640
For planting quality grapes.

24:49.560 --> 24:51.719
Right here.

24:51.720 --> 24:54.239
But don't grapevines
take a long time to grow?

24:54.240 --> 24:55.839
We can do it.

24:55.840 --> 24:58.519
I know we can. You sacrificed
a lot to be with me...

24:58.520 --> 24:59.639
Gino...

24:59.640 --> 25:01.240
..but I'm gonna
make you proud, Mrs Poletti.

25:01.240 --> 25:03.679
You don't have to make me proud.
All the best restaurants.

25:03.680 --> 25:07.520
Imagine, "A bottle of your finest
Poletti?" "Thank you, waiter."

25:07.521 --> 25:10.400
"Poletti Wines
for that special occasion?"

25:10.400 --> 25:14.160
Look at this.
My uncle's going to Toscana.

25:15.240 --> 25:18.279
They're making wines
in traditional bottles, see?

25:18.280 --> 25:21.159
Straw. We got plenty of straw.

25:21.160 --> 25:24.040
Oh, this is my new favourite song!

25:26.800 --> 25:29.519
Ballare con me.
Yeah!

25:29.520 --> 25:32.440
Whoa!

25:49.040 --> 25:50.720
George?

25:52.880 --> 25:56.639
I so much want to help you, but I
know you want to do it on your own.

25:56.640 --> 25:59.799
That's right.
I'm here if you need me.

25:59.800 --> 26:03.119
I could telephone Sir Richard,
postpone the card party.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.919
I'm sure he'd understand.
No.

26:04.920 --> 26:07.479
It was an excellent idea of yours.

26:07.480 --> 26:09.160
You make sure he stays the night.

26:10.200 --> 26:11.840
And thank you.

26:14.800 --> 26:19.040
It all seems so much fuss,
this christening.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.920
Over one chubby boy.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.760
Our chubby boy.

26:28.840 --> 26:30.360
Sleep well.

27:02.960 --> 27:06.359
Oh! Lloyd Ellis-Parker, you ratbag!

27:06.360 --> 27:09.479
Carolyn Bligh, you old tart.

27:09.480 --> 27:12.160
Remember where you are, please.
Well, yes.

27:12.160 --> 27:14.399
Hallowed ground. The family pile.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.079
Mwah. Mwah.

27:16.080 --> 27:20.199
Lo, this is what being
in love looks like.

27:20.200 --> 27:24.239
Iridescent. Or perhaps just smug.

27:24.240 --> 27:26.879
You'll be staying in the outhouse
if you're not careful.

27:26.880 --> 27:28.119
How was it...

27:28.120 --> 27:30.959
Did you find a room for him
away from Mr Bligh's guests?

27:30.960 --> 27:33.360
The groundsman's quarters, Miss.
Good girl.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.639
Ah, Olivia.

27:36.640 --> 27:38.559
Your guest has arrived.

27:38.560 --> 27:42.559
Mrs Bligh, Mrs Standish,
may I introduce Mr Ellis-Parker.

27:42.560 --> 27:45.199
Pleased to meet you both.
And you, Mr Ellis-Parker.

27:45.200 --> 27:47.159
Welcome to Ash Park.
Thank you.

27:47.160 --> 27:48.399
Wait, please.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.119
We've put you in
the groundsman's quarters

27:50.120 --> 27:51.479
we had set aside as your studio.

27:51.480 --> 27:53.720
I'm sure you'll be
much more comfortable there.

27:54.800 --> 27:57.839
You will be.
Full house, I'm afraid.

27:57.840 --> 28:00.119
Do have a very pleasant stay,
Mr Ellis-Parker.

28:00.120 --> 28:03.080
Let's talk card tables
when you have a moment.

28:06.200 --> 28:08.599
So, it's Olivia
you'll be painting, Lloyd.

28:08.600 --> 28:09.600
Ah.

28:09.601 --> 28:12.080
And my son and husband.

28:12.080 --> 28:14.640
Well, for a terrible moment,
I thought it was that snow queen.

28:16.360 --> 28:18.919
But, quelle fortunato.

28:18.920 --> 28:20.759
A perfect English rose.

28:20.760 --> 28:24.160
Thank you, Carolyn. Lucky me.

28:30.755 --> 28:32.755
O clement, O loving,
O sweet Virgin Mary...

28:37.755 --> 28:39.474
Pray for us, O holy Mother of God,

28:39.475 --> 28:41.595
that we may be made worthy
of the promises of Christ.

29:30.490 --> 29:32.690
Well, overall, I'm very pleased.

29:32.690 --> 29:35.089
Your wound is healing
very well indeed.

29:35.090 --> 29:37.449
Quite proud
of my handiwork, actually.

29:37.450 --> 29:40.209
How's the morphine going?
Do you need another prescription?

29:40.210 --> 29:42.050
It certainly takes the pain away.

29:42.050 --> 29:44.809
Well, that's what
it's supposed to do.

29:44.810 --> 29:47.049
But too much of it and you'll
be three sheets to the wind,

29:47.050 --> 29:48.970
so do keep an eye on it,
as I'm sure you will.

29:48.970 --> 29:50.769
You know, you've done
a wonderful job, Mr Fox.

29:50.770 --> 29:52.169
Henry, please.

29:52.170 --> 29:54.609
Yes?

29:54.610 --> 29:57.130
Tea for Mr Fox.
Thank you.

29:57.130 --> 29:59.809
No, credit where
credit's due, George.

29:59.810 --> 30:01.649
If Sister...

30:01.650 --> 30:03.329
Oh, the nurse
who was in the ambulance.

30:03.330 --> 30:04.929
Nordmann.
Nordmann.

30:04.930 --> 30:07.529
If she hadn't had have pulled her
brilliant rabbit out of the hat,

30:07.530 --> 30:09.770
I doubt you would have
made it to my table.

30:10.850 --> 30:13.569
Well, as you can see,
I continue to be well looked after.

30:13.570 --> 30:15.929
And Henry, if you'd care
to stay the evening

30:15.930 --> 30:17.930
after you finish your rounds,
you're most welcome.

30:17.931 --> 30:19.570
Oh, thank you.

30:19.570 --> 30:21.929
Tell me, is Sister Nordmann
still working up here?

30:21.930 --> 30:23.329
Yes. Yes, she is.

30:23.330 --> 30:24.970
Tell her she's still
the talk of the tearoom.

30:24.970 --> 30:26.570
Do give her my best, will you?

30:27.610 --> 30:28.890
Of course.

30:30.330 --> 30:32.009
Ah, for Sarah?

30:32.010 --> 30:33.729
I thought those were for me.

30:33.730 --> 30:36.649
Ah, she's not here.
She's gone to Sydney.

30:36.650 --> 30:38.730
Rene?
No, he's here.

30:39.810 --> 30:41.569
Is that the...
Ah, yes, it is.

30:41.570 --> 30:43.450
I'll get a nurse
to put those in water.

30:54.050 --> 30:56.370
You're making an excellent recovery.
Yes.

30:59.610 --> 31:02.649
I suppose I should have twigged
it was you, at the wedding.

31:02.650 --> 31:04.089
Ah. Yes.

31:04.090 --> 31:05.729
But I didn't.

31:05.730 --> 31:08.569
Well, you were too focused
on giving your daughter away.

31:08.570 --> 31:11.690
A daughter you have every right
to be very, very proud of.

31:15.210 --> 31:16.370
Jack...

31:17.730 --> 31:20.249
I'd feel more comfortable
if this remained within our family.

31:20.250 --> 31:22.129
No-one's business but our own.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.650
Thank you.

31:27.490 --> 31:29.850
I've been told
you'd like some new recordings.

31:30.930 --> 31:33.250
I took a guess
as to what you might enjoy.

31:37.370 --> 31:39.129
Oh? Grappelli!

31:39.130 --> 31:42.249
There's some Maxine Sullivan,
Josephine Baker.

31:42.250 --> 31:44.569
Ah, shall I put this one on?

31:44.570 --> 31:46.169
Not here.

31:46.170 --> 31:47.730
Sorry?

31:47.730 --> 31:49.769
Not here. Sarah is not here.

31:49.770 --> 31:52.969
No, no.
She's in Sydney as I understand.

31:52.970 --> 31:54.570
Her Aunt Peg.

31:56.530 --> 31:59.609
Stephane Grapelli and
Django Reinhardt, I like very much.

31:59.610 --> 32:01.810
Satie, aussi.

32:02.850 --> 32:05.650
Good. So do I.

32:08.610 --> 32:14.289
Very kind of you to chauffeur
Mr Bligh during his convalescence.

32:14.290 --> 32:16.369
I like to help wherever I can.

32:16.370 --> 32:18.289
What a compassionate man,

32:18.290 --> 32:21.649
to visit Dr Nordmann,
given the circumstances.

32:21.650 --> 32:25.409
And also to thank
Sister Nordmann in person.

32:25.410 --> 32:28.729
Well, what a shame. She's not here.

32:28.730 --> 32:30.809
She had to go to Sydney.

32:30.810 --> 32:32.809
Oh, we weren't aware.

32:32.810 --> 32:36.929
I imagine she's gone to seek
medical help for her husband?

32:36.930 --> 32:39.689
I wouldn't know.
Poor man.

32:39.690 --> 32:43.409
I'm told she telephones him
twice a day, sometimes more.

32:43.410 --> 32:45.569
It's Mr Briggs I worry about.

32:45.570 --> 32:46.809
Why?

32:46.810 --> 32:48.810
Well, the man's been a saint
to take in the Nordmanns as he did.

32:48.810 --> 32:50.729
I'm sure he enjoys the company.

32:50.730 --> 32:56.089
But would it be wise to take Mr
Nordmann back after what happened?

32:56.090 --> 32:58.689
Mr Briggs is entirely capable.

32:58.690 --> 33:00.729
And where else would they go?

33:00.730 --> 33:04.249
That is where the Nordmanns
live now. That is their home.

33:04.250 --> 33:07.849
I just assumed Dr Nordmann
would be needing fulltime care.

33:07.850 --> 33:11.770
As I said, you'll find Mr Briggs
entirely capable.

33:16.930 --> 33:18.470
These things
have a way of working out.

34:14.409 --> 34:17.370
Mrs Bligh! Welcome.

34:17.370 --> 34:18.768
Ducks on a pond.

34:18.770 --> 34:20.250
Ducks on a pond, lads.

34:21.449 --> 34:22.929
Oh, don't take any notice.

34:22.929 --> 34:24.409
Oh, I've heard worse, Mr Goddard.

34:24.409 --> 34:25.850
Douglas.

34:27.650 --> 34:29.850
So, this is our refuge.

34:29.850 --> 34:31.768
Ah, yes.

34:31.770 --> 34:33.768
Some of our men sleep rough.

34:33.770 --> 34:37.849
"Weary is he,
and sick of the sorrow of war.

34:37.850 --> 34:41.809
"Hating the shriek of loud music,
the beat of the drum."

34:41.810 --> 34:45.688
"Is this the shadow called glory
men sell themselves for?"

34:45.690 --> 34:47.649
How do you take
your tea, Mrs Bligh?

34:47.650 --> 34:49.649
Oh, I'm here to be of use,
Mr Goddard,

34:49.650 --> 34:51.409
not to sit about drinking tea.

34:57.010 --> 34:58.889
How are you managing?
Everything alright?

34:58.890 --> 35:00.809
I'm very, very well, thank you.

35:00.810 --> 35:03.449
Well, I'm sure
it'll be delicious.

35:03.450 --> 35:06.690
And if it isn't,
they'll throw something.

35:23.330 --> 35:25.249
I hope you're settling in alright.

35:25.250 --> 35:26.489
Yes.

35:26.490 --> 35:29.929
We have a card party this evening,
if you'd care to join the men.

35:29.930 --> 35:32.930
Oh, I think I'd rather
poke my eye out with a pencil.

35:34.530 --> 35:37.410
Oh, is that too rude?
Not at all.

35:38.610 --> 35:40.730
I don't play poker, either.

35:42.730 --> 35:44.489
Oh, I'm not here for a sitting.

35:44.490 --> 35:46.889
Just indulge me.

35:46.890 --> 35:49.130
Alright.

35:52.450 --> 35:54.089
My brother-in-law's wine.

35:54.090 --> 35:56.129
It's grown here.

35:56.130 --> 35:58.129
Thought you might like to try it.

35:58.130 --> 36:00.249
Never trust a country
that doesn't make its own wine.

36:00.250 --> 36:03.009
I hope it's not too rough.

36:03.010 --> 36:04.329
Not for me!

36:04.330 --> 36:05.889
Thank you.

36:05.890 --> 36:07.849
Rightio.

36:07.850 --> 36:10.689
Also, I wasn't sure if you'd eaten.

36:10.690 --> 36:13.089
So, just in case you're peckish.

36:13.090 --> 36:16.689
And I am sorry you've had to
stay so far from the house.

36:16.690 --> 36:19.249
If there's anything you need,
just let me know.

36:19.250 --> 36:21.809
Should I stop talking?

36:21.810 --> 36:23.690
Depends on what you have to say.

36:26.130 --> 36:30.089
Boring, practical matters,
I'm afraid.

36:30.090 --> 36:32.329
How you'll get us all together...

36:32.330 --> 36:36.250
My husband is busy with an auction
today, and after that, he's...

36:36.250 --> 36:38.049
What's it called?

36:38.050 --> 36:40.289
Oh, it's something else
to do with the stock. Um...

36:40.290 --> 36:41.969
Slaughtering them, perhaps?

36:41.970 --> 36:43.769
No!

36:43.770 --> 36:48.089
I can't think when someone's
sketching me.

36:48.090 --> 36:49.490
There.

36:50.570 --> 36:52.609
I'll paint you all separately.

36:52.610 --> 36:54.489
That way I can
get to know you better.

36:54.490 --> 36:56.130
Goodness.

36:57.490 --> 36:58.609
It's me, but...

36:58.610 --> 37:01.169
Yes.
..in a different way.

37:01.170 --> 37:05.810
A painter friend of mine
once described art as deception.

37:09.210 --> 37:11.210
Just...

37:13.970 --> 37:15.770
Yes.

37:18.170 --> 37:20.890
Any favourite painters, Olivia?

37:22.490 --> 37:26.049
I used to love the Dutch masters.

37:26.050 --> 37:27.409
Yes.

37:27.410 --> 37:29.409
The National Gallery in London.

37:29.410 --> 37:32.289
My father used to take me
whenever we went to town.

37:32.290 --> 37:34.929
Van Eyck. Rembrandt?

37:34.930 --> 37:37.449
Vermeer was my favourite.
Yeah.

37:37.450 --> 37:40.049
Have you been there? London?

37:40.050 --> 37:42.850
You must miss it? England.

37:45.770 --> 37:47.169
No.

37:47.170 --> 37:49.210
This is home now.

37:50.170 --> 37:51.890
Hmm.

38:15.410 --> 38:17.049
Cut it up. I can't eat that.

38:17.050 --> 38:18.809
Oh, no, no, no, no. Not to worry.

38:18.810 --> 38:20.249
Bill has to have it cut up for him.

38:20.250 --> 38:23.010
Hang on a sec, mate. Won't be long.

38:24.130 --> 38:26.129
He was an Anzac, that bloke.

38:26.130 --> 38:28.970
Tale to tell,
if anyone could get it out of him.

38:28.970 --> 38:32.290
Want me to do it?
No. No, no. Not at all.

38:41.050 --> 38:44.009
How's that for you Mr, um, Bill?

38:44.010 --> 38:45.529
Is that small enough?

38:45.530 --> 38:47.889
A bit smaller with the
meat, and then a kiss for...

38:47.890 --> 38:50.210
Could you repeat that, please?

38:52.570 --> 38:55.449
No, no, no, no.
Could you just say it again?

38:55.450 --> 38:58.169
Or shall I leave you
to have your meal in peace?

38:58.170 --> 38:59.849
I was only...

38:59.850 --> 39:01.809
Stay and have a chin wag.

39:01.810 --> 39:04.290
I'll leave you.

39:06.330 --> 39:08.809
Does he want something else?

39:08.810 --> 39:10.810
Did you want something else?

39:16.650 --> 39:19.089
Think I might be better in here.

39:19.090 --> 39:22.049
Shall I put you on the roster?
Another day this week?

39:22.050 --> 39:25.450
I don't think so, Mr Goddard.
I'm not sure I'm of use.

39:25.450 --> 39:28.650
Where's my handbag? I left it there.

39:31.250 --> 39:34.010
Being down and out
doesn't make a man a thief.

39:51.850 --> 39:54.170
Could it be any more garish?

40:04.290 --> 40:07.249
This isn't fair on you, Peg.

40:07.250 --> 40:09.770
I've put you
in a terrible position.

40:09.770 --> 40:12.089
I've found a hotel and I'll...

40:12.090 --> 40:13.850
I'll move in there.

40:15.170 --> 40:19.890
The church teaches us
that a child is a gift.

40:19.890 --> 40:22.369
A gift from God.

40:22.370 --> 40:24.210
However, I've...

40:25.730 --> 40:28.930
I've never been in your position.

40:28.930 --> 40:33.090
Judge not and ye shall not be judged.

40:41.530 --> 40:44.930
I had to have two sherries
at the Captain Cook to get this.

41:01.682 --> 41:04.362
You won! Fourth prize.

41:04.578 --> 41:06.818
It's a boiled fruitcake,
so it will last.

41:06.818 --> 41:08.938
I don't even remember
buying a ticket.

41:08.939 --> 41:11.619
It's what everybody always says.
Look, your name.

41:12.899 --> 41:14.618
Well, we'll make short work of it.

41:14.619 --> 41:16.259
Thanks a lot.

41:16.259 --> 41:20.218
The nurses tell me that
Dr Nordmann's been quite agitated.

41:20.219 --> 41:22.058
Well, he would be, with missy away.

41:22.059 --> 41:23.738
I'll drop by and see him directly.

41:23.739 --> 41:26.779
He's safe at the hospital,
which is a good thing.

41:26.780 --> 41:28.579
He'll be safe back here, as well.

41:28.579 --> 41:30.378
Do you really think so, Mr Briggs?

41:30.379 --> 41:32.818
Given George Bligh's lucky escape.

41:32.819 --> 41:34.578
Now, I know you mean well,

41:34.579 --> 41:38.139
but that poor bugger was trying
to kill himself, not anyone else.

41:39.859 --> 41:41.979
We'll have this for
the coming-home tea, eh?

41:57.819 --> 42:00.218
Just... relax.

42:00.219 --> 42:01.578
I am relaxed.

42:01.579 --> 42:04.338
No, you're not. You're too straight.
You're too erect.

42:04.339 --> 42:08.019
I mean, you look like you have
something stuck up your... spine.

42:11.219 --> 42:13.699
My mother was wont to say

42:13.819 --> 42:15.858
my posture was
my most attractive feature.

42:15.859 --> 42:19.179
Well, your mother was a damn fool.

42:26.219 --> 42:30.139
May I ask how long
these preliminary sketches take?

42:31.819 --> 42:34.099
Change of plan.

42:38.059 --> 42:39.418
Oh, no!

42:39.419 --> 42:41.339
Oh, no, no! I don't like this!

42:45.339 --> 42:47.459
Whoo-hoo!

42:49.259 --> 42:51.498
Are you relaxed now?

42:51.499 --> 42:54.139
I'm relaxed!

42:59.299 --> 43:04.098
James? this artist chap...
He won't make up the numbers?

43:04.099 --> 43:05.939
Apparently not.

43:16.139 --> 43:18.538
Do you want me to make up
a table or not?

43:18.539 --> 43:20.738
A chap can't play cards
without his lucky tie.

43:20.739 --> 43:23.178
You'll make a fool out of George.
You go and change!

43:23.179 --> 43:25.378
Or I could play starkers.
What would you prefer?

43:25.379 --> 43:28.818
Rightio, chaps - problem solved.
Where am I?

43:28.819 --> 43:31.339
Resident cardsharp Miss Bligh's
offered to make up a table.

43:31.339 --> 43:34.258
Good on you, Aunt Carolyn.
You never cease to amaze me.

43:34.259 --> 43:37.539
You watch out for my sister.
She's lethal.

43:38.819 --> 43:40.739
Sir Richard.

43:51.739 --> 43:53.979
Hello, there. Come in.

43:55.979 --> 43:58.259
I'm so sorry.
Come on in.

43:59.979 --> 44:04.379
I know this is unexpected.
Don't mind me.

44:07.019 --> 44:09.939
I wanted to thank you for today.

44:11.139 --> 44:12.579
It was lovely.

44:12.579 --> 44:16.178
It was really lovely
and I had a marvellous time,

44:16.179 --> 44:19.779
but I just wanted to say that...

44:19.779 --> 44:22.299
I am a happily married woman.
