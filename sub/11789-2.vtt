00:03.170 --> 00:04.728
ABOUT YOURSELF.

00:08.600 --> 00:09.737
HOW TO HELP YOU.

00:09.740 --> 00:10.809
>> KIKI IS THE ONE WHO NEEDS

00:10.810 --> 00:12.505
HELP, NOT ME. I'M MERELY HER

00:12.510 --> 00:13.477
ADVOCATE.

00:13.480 --> 00:16.074
>> I'M SORRY. THERE'S REALLY NO

00:16.080 --> 00:17.377
POINT IN HAVING A CONSULTATION

00:17.380 --> 00:19.075
WITHOUT THE PATIENT PRESENT.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.172
>> SHE'S A GORILLA.

00:20.180 --> 00:23.217
>> I'M SURE YOU'RE EXAGGERATING.

00:23.220 --> 00:24.289
WE'VE SEEN ALL SORTS OF

00:24.290 --> 00:24.813
SERIOUS--

00:24.820 --> 00:27.357
>> A MOUNTAIN GORILLA. I AM

00:27.360 --> 00:29.089
DR. MEREDITH FORSYTHE FROM

00:29.090 --> 00:32.753
THE GORILLA PROTECTION AGENCY.

00:32.760 --> 00:34.159
>> THIS IS A JOKE, RIGHT?

00:34.160 --> 00:35.525
>> I THOUGHT YOU KNEW. I SENT

00:35.530 --> 00:37.122
INFORMATION ABOUT MY WORK AND

00:37.130 --> 00:38.620
YOUR NURSE MADE AN APPOINTMENT

00:38.630 --> 00:39.437
FOR ME.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.089
>> FOR YOU, YES. NOT FOR SOME

00:41.100 --> 00:42.203
MONKEY.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.609
>> APE. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

00:43.610 --> 00:45.760
WE SHARE 98.4% OF OUR DNA WITH

00:45.770 --> 00:46.634
TH ESE CREATURES.

00:46.640 --> 00:47.629
>> I'M AFRAID THERE'S BEEN

00:47.640 --> 00:48.834
A TERRIBLE MISUNDERSTANDING,

00:48.840 --> 00:51.206
DR. FORSYTHE. WE DON'T DO

00:51.210 --> 00:52.245
ANIMALS.

00:52.250 --> 00:53.171
>> KIKI IS NOT LOOKING TO BE

00:53.180 --> 00:56.638
DONE. SHE WANTS TO HAVE A BABY.

00:56.650 --> 00:58.208
>> SHE TOLD YOU THAT?

00:58.220 --> 00:59.881
>> KIKI CAN SIGN OVER 1,000

00:59.890 --> 01:01.687
WORDS AND UNDERSTANDS SPOKEN

01:01.690 --> 01:03.351
ENGLISH. SHE'S ALREADY CHOSEN

01:03.360 --> 01:05.885
A MATE, KOOMBA, THROUGH VIDEO

01:05.890 --> 01:07.255
DATING, BUT SHE CAN'T MEET HIM

01:07.260 --> 01:08.522
UNTIL THE SCAR ON HER FACE IS

01:08.530 --> 01:11.522
FIXED.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.634
>> ARE YOU SAYING THAT KIKI HAS

01:13.640 --> 01:15.335
A SELF-IMAGE PROBLEM?

01:15.340 --> 01:16.329
>> APES ARE THE ONLY OTHER

01:16.340 --> 01:17.705
CREATURES BESIDES HUMANS WHO CAN

01:17.710 --> 01:18.768
RECOGNIZE THEMSELVES IN THE

01:18.770 --> 01:19.805
MIRROR. SHE KNOWS SHE'S

01:19.810 --> 01:21.300
DIFFERENT, IMPERFECT IN SOME

01:21.310 --> 01:22.743
WAY.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.570
>> SHE COULD USE SOME LIP GLOSS.

01:24.580 --> 01:27.219
>> I'M SORRY, DR. FORSYTHE, BUT

01:27.220 --> 01:28.471
I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING

01:28.480 --> 01:29.913
THAT SELF-LOATHING HAS EXTENDED

01:29.920 --> 01:30.909
TO THE ANIMAL KINGDOM.

01:30.920 --> 01:31.818
>> IT'S MORE A QUESTION OF

01:31.820 --> 01:34.152
NATURAL SELECTION, WHICH, FIRST

01:34.160 --> 01:35.559
AND FOREMOST, INVOLVES THE

01:35.560 --> 01:37.619
SELECTION OF A MATE. ANY SORT OF

01:37.630 --> 01:39.154
DEFORMITY IN AN ANIMAL BECOMES

01:39.160 --> 01:41.856
UNDESIRABLE, A MISFIT, RELEGATED

01:41.860 --> 01:43.669
TO THE OUTER EDGES OF THE HERD.

01:43.670 --> 01:45.262
>> AND SO, SHE DECIDED ON

01:45.270 --> 01:46.396
PLASTIC SURGERY?

01:46.400 --> 01:48.436
>> I AM GRAVELY CONCERNED THAT

01:48.440 --> 01:49.702
WHEN KOOMBA SEES HER SCAR, HE

01:49.710 --> 01:51.598
WILL A'l'I'ACK HER, OR MORE

01:51.610 --> 01:54.636
REALISTICALLY, KILL HER. I'M

01:54.640 --> 01:57.438
APPEALING TO YOU AS SCIENTISTS.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.179
AT LEAST LOOK AT SOME OF MY

01:59.180 --> 02:04.288
RESEARCH BEFORE YOU DECIDE.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.518
I BEGAN WORKING WITH HER WHEN

02:05.520 --> 02:08.387
SHE WAS A BABY. SHE'D BEEN

02:08.390 --> 02:10.483
RESCUED AFI'ER HER MOTHER WAS

02:10.490 --> 02:13.197
BUTCHERED BY POACHERS. THEY CUT

02:13.200 --> 02:16.624
OFF HER MOTHER'S HANDS AND HEAD.

02:16.630 --> 02:18.461
IT'S ILLEGAL, BUT THEY STILL

02:18.470 --> 02:19.869
SOLD ON THE BLACK MARKET. IT'S

02:19.870 --> 02:23.931
A POPULAR APHRODISIAC. KIKI

02:23.940 --> 02:25.532
ESCAPED WITH JUST A GASH

02:25.540 --> 02:27.508
FROM THE LEFT SIDE

02:30.680 --> 02:32.614

02:32.620 --> 02:34.212
TURNED INTO A LIFELONG STUDY OF

02:34.220 --> 02:37.883
INTERSPECIES COMMUNICATION. IT

02:37.890 --> 02:39.482
IS IMPERATIVE THAT KIKI

02:39.490 --> 02:41.378
PROCREATE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE

02:41.390 --> 02:42.823
IF SHE CAN PASS ON HER LANGUAGE

02:42.830 --> 02:45.287
SKILLS TO HER OFFSPRING.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.393
OTHERWISE, ALL THE WORK WE'VE

02:46.400 --> 02:48.618
DONE WILL DISAPPEAR WITH HER

02:48.630 --> 02:49.790
WHEN SHE DIES.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.291
>> LOOK, MAYBE KOOMBA CAN SEE

02:52.300 --> 02:54.495
PAST KIKI'S SCAR TO HER INNER

02:54.500 --> 02:56.263
BEAUTY. MAYBE HE'S NOT A SHALLOW

02:56.270 --> 02:57.703
