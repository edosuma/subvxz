00:13.972 --> 00:15.432
[Matt groaning]

00:37.037 --> 00:38.163
[grunts]

00:39.122 --> 00:40.708
Oh, God.

00:42.835 --> 00:44.127
[gasps]

00:59.184 --> 01:00.435
[groaning]

01:11.614 --> 01:14.116
[Foggy] Wouldn't do that if I were you.

01:18.621 --> 01:20.581
Then again, maybe I would.

01:21.582 --> 01:24.292
The hell do I know
about Matt Murdock?

01:24.376 --> 01:27.004
-You stitched me up?
-Nope.

01:29.632 --> 01:31.049
That was your nurse friend.

01:31.717 --> 01:32.801
Claire?

01:33.301 --> 01:34.344
You had me get a hold of her

01:34.427 --> 01:36.847
after you took a swing at me
for trying to get you to the hospital.

01:38.431 --> 01:39.975
I don't remember.

01:41.727 --> 01:42.728
Sorry.

01:45.397 --> 01:47.190
She was hot, by the way.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.944
But I guess you already knew that, huh?

01:51.028 --> 01:53.280
-Foggy...
-Just tell me one thing, Matt.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.617
Are you even really blind?

01:58.160 --> 02:00.162
[theme music playing]

03:00.555 --> 03:03.225
God damn it! Come on!

03:04.142 --> 03:06.979
-Load. Load!
-[knocking on door]

03:07.062 --> 03:09.689
-What?
-Excuse me, is this room 312?

03:09.773 --> 03:12.150
Yeah, who're you looking for?

03:14.319 --> 03:16.196
Oh... uh, sorry.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.574
-What for?
-You're blind, right?

03:20.408 --> 03:22.410
Uh, yeah, so they tell me.

03:22.494 --> 03:25.455
-I hope that won't be a problem.
-Why would it?

03:25.998 --> 03:27.165
Oh!

03:27.249 --> 03:28.834
You're-- You're my roomie!

03:28.917 --> 03:30.753
Uh, Matt Murdock.

03:32.838 --> 03:33.964
Foggy Nelson.

03:34.714 --> 03:37.926
Wait, Matt Murdock?
Are you--

03:38.010 --> 03:40.303
-You're not from Hell's Kitchen, are you?
-Yeah, born and raised.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.430
So am I!

03:42.514 --> 03:44.307
Yeah, I heard about you
when you were a kid,

03:44.391 --> 03:46.684
what you did,
saving that guy crossing the street.

03:46.769 --> 03:49.354
Yeah, I--
I just did what anyone would have.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.523
Bullshit. You are a hero.

03:51.606 --> 03:52.816
I'm really not. [chuckles]

03:52.900 --> 03:55.402
Come on! You got your peepers
knocked out saving that old dude.

03:55.485 --> 03:56.945
They didn't get knocked out.

03:57.029 --> 03:58.238
Good,

03:58.321 --> 04:01.699
'cause that would be...
a little freaky. But no offense.

04:01.784 --> 04:04.119
Please, none taken. Uh...

04:05.078 --> 04:09.166
Most people dance around me
like I'm made of glass. I hate that.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.169
Yeah, you're just a guy, right?

04:12.252 --> 04:15.130
A really,
really good-looking guy.

04:16.840 --> 04:17.841
Oh, um...

04:18.759 --> 04:22.095
I mean, girls must love that,
the whole...

04:22.179 --> 04:24.014
wounded, handsome duck thing.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.141
-Am I right?
-Right. [chuckles]

04:26.224 --> 04:27.851
Yeah, it's been known to happen.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.770
This is gonna be awesome!

04:29.853 --> 04:30.979
What is?

04:31.063 --> 04:32.314
Me as your wingman!

04:32.397 --> 04:35.859
You're gonna open up a whole caliber
of women I've only dreamed of.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.444
A lot!

04:37.527 --> 04:38.987
We're gonna be
like Maverick and Goose!

04:39.071 --> 04:40.447
-Okay.
-[laptop dings]

04:40.530 --> 04:42.074
Oh, shit!

04:43.491 --> 04:44.701
Yes.

04:44.785 --> 04:45.828
I'm in!

04:45.911 --> 04:48.789
-In what?
-Punjabi. I got the last spot.

04:49.790 --> 04:50.916
You're taking Punjabi?

04:50.999 --> 04:54.419
It's spoken by 130 million people.
I'd like to know what they're saying.

04:54.502 --> 04:57.380
-That's the only reason?
-Well, yeah.

04:57.464 --> 05:00.425
I mean, why else would I learn it?

05:01.426 --> 05:03.678
I don't know... a girl, maybe?

05:03.761 --> 05:06.932
See? This is what I'm talking about.

05:07.015 --> 05:10.477
Me and you...
Maverick and Goose, no secrets.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.188
Goose died...
and he was married.

05:13.271 --> 05:14.397
Details.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.984
Hey, do you know a good place
to get a cup of coffee on campus?

05:17.067 --> 05:19.152
-No.
-Well, lucky for you, I do.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.529
And it's filled with luscious coeds.
Shall we?

05:21.613 --> 05:23.031
Yeah, lead the way.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.452
So, you can see.

05:27.535 --> 05:28.745
That's not--
You're not--

05:28.829 --> 05:30.956
Are you even listening
to what I'm saying?

05:31.039 --> 05:34.501
Yeah, world on fire, I got it.
But you can see, right?

05:34.584 --> 05:36.962
Yeah, in a manner of speaking.
But I--

05:37.045 --> 05:38.338
No! No manner!

05:39.882 --> 05:41.424
How many fingers am I holding up?

05:42.968 --> 05:44.302
One.

05:56.814 --> 05:59.151
All these years,
I actually felt sorry for you.

05:59.234 --> 06:01.778
I didn't ask for that. I never--
I never asked for that.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.072
Yeah, I didn't ask to be lied to.

06:04.156 --> 06:05.991
-I thought we were friends.
-We are.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.493
You've lied to me, Matt,
since the day we met.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.913
What did you expect me to say, Foggy?

06:10.996 --> 06:14.457
"Hi, I'm Matt. I got some chemicals
splashed in my eyes when I was a kid

06:14.541 --> 06:16.334
that gave me heightened senses."

06:16.418 --> 06:17.877
Well, maybe not lead with that.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.755
I didn't even tell my dad
after it happened.

06:20.838 --> 06:22.132
But you told that nurse, Claire.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.217
Because I didn't have a choice.

06:24.301 --> 06:25.928
[breathing heavily]

06:26.011 --> 06:28.888
She found me in a dumpster, all right?
Half dead.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.515
She didn't--
She didn't tell you?

06:30.598 --> 06:33.851
She wouldn't say anything about all this.

06:35.853 --> 06:37.022
She seemed nice.

06:38.190 --> 06:39.316
She is.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.783
[sighs heavily]

06:51.494 --> 06:55.207
Did you blow up those buildings?
Shoot those cops?

06:55.290 --> 06:57.834
You really even need to ask that?

06:57.917 --> 07:00.337
Yeah, I think I do.

07:03.381 --> 07:05.300
[stutters] It was Fisk.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.261
It was all Fisk.

07:08.928 --> 07:12.224
-He did this to you?
-He and Nobu.

07:12.307 --> 07:13.516
Nobu?

07:13.600 --> 07:16.811
Yeah, I think he's some kind of... ninja.

07:18.646 --> 07:20.107
A ninja.

07:20.190 --> 07:21.566
I think.

07:21.649 --> 07:24.194
What are you doing, Matt?

07:24.277 --> 07:26.654
You're a lawyer.
You're supposed to be helping people.

07:26.738 --> 07:27.864
I am.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.407
In a mask!

07:29.491 --> 07:31.409
Do you know what they call that?
A vigilante.

07:31.493 --> 07:33.203
Someone who acts outside of the law.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.248
[female voice over cell phone]
Karen. Karen.

07:36.331 --> 07:40.293
Karen. Karen. Karen.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.045
Foggy, Foggy, Foggy.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.881
-She deserves to know.
-You can't tell her, Foggy, please.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.549
-Is this what you do?
-[cell phone beeps]

07:47.968 --> 07:50.137
When we call, trying to get
you to come out for drinks?

07:50.220 --> 07:53.556
Trying to find you when bombs
are going off and we're worried?

07:53.640 --> 07:55.558
[female voice] Voicemail.

07:55.642 --> 07:56.977
-You just hit ignore?
-[phone beeps]

07:58.311 --> 07:59.396
No.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.106
[cell phone ringing]

08:06.069 --> 08:08.280
-It's her again.
-Please, Foggy.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.867
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:12.950 --> 08:14.577
I tried calling Matt.
Where are you guys?

08:14.661 --> 08:16.038
We're at his place.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.372
Is everything okay?

08:17.455 --> 08:19.791
No, Matt was--

08:24.171 --> 08:25.922
Matt was in an accident.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.008
Oh, my God.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.884
What happened?

08:30.468 --> 08:32.095
He was in a car accident.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.764
-Matt was driving?
-No, he, um--

08:34.847 --> 08:36.683
He got hit.

08:36.766 --> 08:40.062
Well, is he all right?
Look, I-- I'm coming over.

08:40.145 --> 08:42.147
No, stay at the office.
We need you there.

08:42.230 --> 08:44.816
-There's nothing you can do here.
-Okay.

08:44.899 --> 08:47.652
-Foggy...
-I got this, Karen.

08:48.736 --> 08:51.073
I'll call you if we need anything.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.122
Thank you.

08:59.206 --> 09:03.585
Screw you. I just lied
to somebody that I care about.

09:03.668 --> 09:06.296
I want to know everything.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.632
And don't you leave
a damn thing out.

09:29.152 --> 09:33.615
[in Mandarin] I have never seen you,
absent your man by your side.

09:33.698 --> 09:37.285
No need for a translator now.

09:37.369 --> 09:38.995
Or pretenses.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.461
[sighs]

09:50.632 --> 09:54.719
There was a snake,
in the village where I was raised...

09:55.262 --> 09:59.474
who mistook an elephant as prey.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.934
It died...

10:02.018 --> 10:03.978
with its jaws wide...

10:05.105 --> 10:08.566
clenched around no more
than the elephant's foot,

10:08.650 --> 10:11.944
betrayed by ambition.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.158
Am I the snake...

10:16.241 --> 10:17.617
or the elephant?

10:18.493 --> 10:22.622
What happened to Nobu was...

10:22.705 --> 10:23.831
unfortunate.

10:23.915 --> 10:26.709
I asked for a warrior...

10:27.544 --> 10:29.296
to eliminate...

10:29.379 --> 10:30.880
the Masked Man.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.258
He chose to take it upon himself.

10:33.341 --> 10:36.219
He is a man of pride.

10:37.011 --> 10:38.930
Something well known to you.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.224
What's done...

10:41.308 --> 10:43.143
is done.

10:43.226 --> 10:46.313
And the man in the mask...

10:46.396 --> 10:48.315
you have found his body?

10:49.524 --> 10:50.942
No.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.779
Yet Nobu's clan...

10:54.862 --> 10:56.864
prepare his...

10:56.948 --> 10:59.326
for what is to come.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.665
They are distracted.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.335
But their memories...

11:08.418 --> 11:11.338
and their knives...

11:11.421 --> 11:14.341
are forever sharp.

11:14.424 --> 11:18.303
Is that why you wanted to meet?

11:19.053 --> 11:20.847
To warn me...

11:20.930 --> 11:23.891
of what I already know?

11:25.560 --> 11:28.355
I only sought to pose a question.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.773
How long before...

11:30.857 --> 11:34.110
your ambition turns to me?

11:36.363 --> 11:39.574
You always possessed
what the others did not.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.033
My respect.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.077
[chuckles]

11:43.160 --> 11:45.162
Perhaps.

11:45.247 --> 11:47.415
Yet...

11:47.499 --> 11:50.627
you are not the man who came to me...

11:50.710 --> 11:52.670
with a dream...

11:52.754 --> 11:54.714
for this city.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.884
He was of a...

11:57.967 --> 11:59.469
singular mind.

12:01.178 --> 12:05.642
Yours now is pulled in two directions...

12:06.726 --> 12:09.812
by longings of the heart.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.231
Is that why we're here?

12:12.315 --> 12:14.191
To discuss...

12:14.276 --> 12:15.818
my private affairs?

12:17.028 --> 12:18.530
No.

12:18.613 --> 12:20.740
We are here...

12:20.823 --> 12:22.784
to discuss your fate.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.999
[in English]
I speak your tongue now.

12:31.083 --> 12:34.128
So there is no mistaking my words.

12:36.213 --> 12:38.841
There is conflict within you.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.427
Conflict?

12:41.469 --> 12:46.057
Man cannot be both
savior and oppressor...

12:47.350 --> 12:50.227
light and shadow.

12:51.228 --> 12:54.816
One has to be sacrificed for the other.

12:58.945 --> 13:03.783
Choose... and choose wisely.

13:10.748 --> 13:14.126
Or others shall choose for you.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.015
[sighs]

13:31.227 --> 13:32.937
Hello, gorgeous.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.077
Hello, handsome.

13:52.499 --> 13:53.791
[Doris] Mmm...

13:54.709 --> 13:57.086
You're wearing that aftershave.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.839
-You remember?
-Of course, I do.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.759
-Always got me going.
-[both chuckle]

14:04.844 --> 14:05.970
I've missed you.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.643
They say anything?

14:14.103 --> 14:15.354
They, um...

14:16.981 --> 14:18.650
They think you're improving.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.781
What are you working on?

14:26.616 --> 14:27.659
Uh...

14:27.742 --> 14:29.619
It's nothing. Just, uh...

14:31.829 --> 14:34.123
outsmarted by a story.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.834
You'll figure it out.
Always do.

14:38.420 --> 14:41.338
There are more important things
than the job right now.

14:42.590 --> 14:45.009
I should be here with you, not, uh...

14:46.553 --> 14:49.305
chasing down leads,
getting my ass in trouble.

14:51.098 --> 14:54.268
Your name is Ben Urich...

14:54.351 --> 14:56.854
and you are a reporter.

14:56.938 --> 15:00.442
It's not a job.
It's who you are.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.652
I don't know.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.822
This was 20 years ago, maybe.

15:08.324 --> 15:12.286
I was... more fearless then.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.999
Don't see much of that guy now.

15:19.335 --> 15:23.423
When we first met,
you weren't fearless.

15:23.506 --> 15:26.634
You were reckless... pushy.

15:26.718 --> 15:31.681
You were all about making a big splash,
turning heads...

15:31.764 --> 15:34.225
You certainly turned mine.

15:35.392 --> 15:38.938
But that's not who you were
always supposed to be.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.649
Experience made you more careful...

15:42.399 --> 15:44.318
wise.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.364
I don't know, Ben Urich...

15:49.156 --> 15:52.619
I think your best work is still ahead.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.832
You keep sweet-talking...
I'm gonna climb in there with you.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.001
[both laughing]

16:01.002 --> 16:02.336
[both moaning softly]

16:11.262 --> 16:12.388
Doris?

16:14.474 --> 16:15.683
Baby?

16:20.312 --> 16:22.899
Hello, gorgeous.

16:28.530 --> 16:29.822
Hello, handsome.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.285
[Shirley] Ben?

16:35.244 --> 16:36.496
[mouthing]

16:36.579 --> 16:37.997
I'll be right back.

16:46.463 --> 16:48.299
Is this about the extension?

16:48.382 --> 16:50.677
Let's speak outside, yeah?

17:00.061 --> 17:02.522
-I'm sorry.
-[Ben] How do you know you did everything?

17:02.605 --> 17:04.106
I did everything.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.316
[Ben sighs]

17:30.925 --> 17:32.509
The hell you get all this crap?

17:32.594 --> 17:34.303
The Internet.

17:35.346 --> 17:36.472
The Internet.

17:38.600 --> 17:42.729
Thought you long-underwear types
stitched these together yourselves.

17:45.522 --> 17:47.108
I never learned how to sew.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.069
But you learned how to fight.

17:51.654 --> 17:55.532
That news footage of you...
in the alley, after the bombings...

17:55.617 --> 17:57.785
the way you were flipping around...

17:58.703 --> 18:00.747
Your dad was a boxer.

18:00.830 --> 18:02.498
He didn't teach you
any of that stuff, did he?

18:02.582 --> 18:06.377
He didn't want me to fight.
You know that.

18:06.460 --> 18:07.920
So, how'd you get so good at it?

18:08.880 --> 18:10.131
[grunts]

18:12.299 --> 18:14.343
An old man named Stick.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.345
[scoffs] You're shitting me.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.097
He found me at the orphanage.

18:19.056 --> 18:20.808
Blind like me.

18:20.892 --> 18:24.020
Well, almost like me.

18:24.103 --> 18:28.733
A blind old man... taught you
the ancient ways of martial arts.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.735
Isn't that the plot to Kung Fu?

18:30.818 --> 18:32.236
I know how it sounds.

18:33.487 --> 18:34.822
I don't think that you do.

18:34.906 --> 18:36.532
He did more than start my training.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.160
He taught me that my blindness
wasn't a disability, that...

18:39.243 --> 18:40.870
sight was a distraction.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.874
He helped me understand
everything I could do.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.709
Define "everything."

18:46.793 --> 18:49.962
It's hard to explain, Foggy.
[stammers] My abilities...

18:50.046 --> 18:52.757
I just know things, okay?

18:52.840 --> 18:54.383
No, not okay.

18:54.466 --> 18:57.344
Can you read my mind?
Can you predict the future? What?

18:57.428 --> 18:59.055
What things do you just know?

18:59.138 --> 19:02.642
I know you haven't showered
since yesterday morning.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.894
But you rinsed your face
in my kitchen sink.

19:06.478 --> 19:10.024
I know you had onions
in your lunch two days ago.

19:10.107 --> 19:12.526
I know you're hungry... and tired.

19:12.609 --> 19:15.780
And I know the more I say,
the faster your heart beats.

19:18.157 --> 19:21.160
You can hear a heartbeat?
From across the room?

19:21.243 --> 19:23.370
Helps to anticipate behavior.

19:24.496 --> 19:27.416
When someone's gonna attack...
when they're lying.

19:27.499 --> 19:30.169
That's how you knew
Karen was telling the truth...

19:30.252 --> 19:33.214
-when we first met her at the precinct.
-Yeah.

19:34.506 --> 19:37.885
You listened to her heartbeat
without her permission?

19:37.969 --> 19:41.513
We're lawyers!
You can't do that!

19:41.597 --> 19:45.101
There's a system in place,
and it's weird and invasive and--

19:48.562 --> 19:49.939
Wait.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.235
Are you telling me that
since I've known you,

19:54.318 --> 19:57.154
any time I wasn't telling the truth,
you knew?

19:58.280 --> 20:01.408
And what, you just played along?

20:03.369 --> 20:04.620
Basically.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.750
If you weren't half dead,
I would kick your ass, Murdock.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.501
Am I lying about that?

20:11.543 --> 20:12.754
No.

20:15.297 --> 20:17.633
Was anything ever real with us?

20:17.717 --> 20:21.428
Watch out, everybody!
I'm Blind Matt Murdock! Whoa!

20:21.512 --> 20:24.807
Most-- Most people just say,
"Matt Murdock."

20:24.891 --> 20:26.768
I look like most people?

20:26.851 --> 20:28.060
I don't know, I can't see you.

20:28.144 --> 20:31.355
Well, at the moment,
that may be a blessing.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.775
Oh, God,
we should be studying.

20:33.858 --> 20:37.653
You're gonna graduate summa cum laude,
you can take a night off, you nerd!

20:37.737 --> 20:40.865
-Yup, you'd be--
-[both laughing]

20:40.948 --> 20:44.285
You'd be graduating with that, too,
if you took a few less nights off.

20:44.368 --> 20:46.954
Point being,
we are both one day gonna be

20:47.038 --> 20:49.874
fine, upstanding members
of the legal profession.

20:49.957 --> 20:53.044
El grande--
How do you say "lawyers" in Spanish?

20:53.127 --> 20:56.130
Lawyers? Abogados.

20:56.213 --> 20:58.800
-El grande avocados!
-[stammers]

20:58.883 --> 21:01.010
[laughing]
That's not Spanish, that's fruit.

21:01.093 --> 21:04.013
-That's fruit.
-It's a vegetable at best.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.975
See, that's what you get for taking
Punjabi instead of Spanish with me,

21:08.059 --> 21:10.311
-just to chase a girl.
-What? No!

21:11.813 --> 21:12.814
I'm sorry.

21:12.897 --> 21:18.069
I'll have you know that Punjabi
is the future language of the future...

21:18.152 --> 21:19.736
of business.

21:19.821 --> 21:21.613
Couple years,
we'll all be speaking it.

21:21.697 --> 21:24.116
And she was so hot.
She was so hot!

21:24.200 --> 21:25.659
Yeah, say that in Punjabi.

21:25.742 --> 21:28.079
[stammering]

21:29.080 --> 21:32.041
-God! Shut up! Kiss my ass.
-You can't speak--

21:32.124 --> 21:33.292
No! No, no, no, no.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.252
Are you trying to tell me
that you didn't take Spanish

21:35.336 --> 21:37.004
-to snuggle up to what's-her-name...
-What?

21:37.088 --> 21:39.048
...the Greek girl?

21:39.131 --> 21:41.801
Well, I... surely I would take Greek?

21:41.884 --> 21:46.597
No, because she was taking Spanish.
She already spoke Greek.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.850
Whatever happened to her?
She was smokin'.

21:48.933 --> 21:51.143
-[sighs] Man, it didn't work out.
-[blows raspberry]

21:51.227 --> 21:55.272
When does it ever with you, buddy?
How can I help you?

21:55.356 --> 21:57.942
[mimicking Yoda] What are you looking for,
my young Padawan?

21:58.025 --> 21:59.360
I don't know.

21:59.443 --> 22:01.528
I guess just someone
I really like listening to.

22:01.612 --> 22:02.779
[blows raspberry]

22:03.489 --> 22:05.782
-Where are those stairs?
-[in normal voice] Stairs, here.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.160
[sighs] I would like to sit now.

22:08.244 --> 22:10.579
Yes... we sit!

22:11.580 --> 22:13.457
-[exhales deeply]
-And then we forage for hamburgers

22:13.540 --> 22:14.876
and more libations!

22:16.210 --> 22:17.837
How about just the burgers?

22:17.920 --> 22:19.588
Lightweight!

22:19.671 --> 22:21.507
Hey, do you get the spins?

22:23.800 --> 22:26.470
-Can you get those if you can't see?
-Yeah, I get the spins.

22:26.553 --> 22:28.931
-Really?
-Yeah, it's... [stammering]

22:29.015 --> 22:30.933
It's an equilibrium thing,
it's not your eyes.

22:31.017 --> 22:35.396
Liquid in your inner ear gets disturbed,
has trouble leveling off or something.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.440
Huh.

22:38.524 --> 22:42.153
That sucks. I thought
you might get a pass on that one.

22:42.236 --> 22:44.363
No, it's even worse for me, I think.

22:44.446 --> 22:46.698
'Cause my senses are so-- Are...

22:47.616 --> 22:48.617
Mmm.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.328
-So what? Delicate?
-Hmm?

22:51.412 --> 22:54.873
Yeah... you could say that.

22:55.666 --> 22:58.127
Hey, how old were you
when you had your first drink?

22:58.210 --> 23:00.754
-Nine.
-Nine?

23:00.837 --> 23:01.880
[laughing]

23:01.964 --> 23:03.174
Lush.

23:03.257 --> 23:05.426
My dad gave me a sip
from this bottle of Scotch.

23:05.509 --> 23:06.593
Go, Dad!

23:06.677 --> 23:09.180
He didn't want my hands shaking
while I stitched him up.

23:09.263 --> 23:13.559
He got cut pretty bad over his eye.
Boxing match.

23:13.642 --> 23:14.936
He win?

23:16.562 --> 23:17.604
No.

23:21.608 --> 23:25.071
-He'd be proud of you, buddy.
-Thanks, man.

23:26.322 --> 23:29.116
All he ever wanted was for me
to use my head, not my fists.

23:30.117 --> 23:31.202
Not like him.

23:32.703 --> 23:34.913
My mom wanted me to be a butcher.

23:34.997 --> 23:35.998
[laughs]

23:36.082 --> 23:38.375
I think she liked the idea of free ham.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.712
Hey, they coming to graduation?
Your family?

23:41.795 --> 23:43.547
The whole extended brood.

23:43.630 --> 23:45.466
It's not every day a...

23:45.549 --> 23:48.719
Nelson breaks from the ranks
of hardware and cured meats.

23:48.802 --> 23:51.638
Franklin Nelson for the defense,
Your Honor.

23:51.722 --> 23:54.100
Defense! I like that.
There's money in that.

23:54.183 --> 23:55.892
Oh, come on.
Is that all you care about?

23:55.977 --> 23:57.811
No... No.

23:58.729 --> 24:00.731
Truth and justice and all of that.

24:03.317 --> 24:04.485
Couple of bucks?

24:05.944 --> 24:07.196
Me and you, pal.

24:07.279 --> 24:10.699
We're gonna have big,
fancy offices one day,

24:10.782 --> 24:15.454
with steel and glass and chairs
you don't even know how to sit in.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.207
Murdock and Nelson,
attorneys at law!

24:18.290 --> 24:21.127
Nelson and Murdock.
Sounds better.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.629
-You think?
-Yeah, trust me.

24:24.838 --> 24:27.799
I can't see worth shit,
but my hearing's spectacular.

24:29.426 --> 24:32.804
Me and you, pal...
We're gonna do this.

24:33.555 --> 24:37.018
We're gonna be the best damn avocados
this city has ever seen.

24:37.101 --> 24:39.145
[both laughing]

24:39.228 --> 24:41.105
Best damn avocados.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.691
Let's get the hell out of here, come on.

24:44.775 --> 24:46.277
[grunts]

24:47.028 --> 24:49.571
[Matt] You're strong.
[Foggy] I work out.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.115
[Matt laughing]

25:02.000 --> 25:04.628
Hey... got a minute?

25:05.546 --> 25:07.214
Yeah.

25:10.676 --> 25:11.802
[clears throat]

25:12.761 --> 25:16.723
Caldwell says you, uh, handed
the fundraiser piece off to her.

25:18.309 --> 25:20.561
I had something come up.
Going to be a problem?

25:20.644 --> 25:23.314
I don't know. You tell me.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.236
It's personal.
You mind?

25:29.320 --> 25:31.072
[stammers] Just--

25:31.155 --> 25:32.364
Just checking.

25:34.325 --> 25:35.367
[clears throat]

25:41.165 --> 25:45.502
Haverson cornered me
in the bathroom this morning.

25:48.464 --> 25:49.840
This something I'm gonna wanna hear?

25:49.923 --> 25:54.636
Maybe. He's packing it in,
the end of the month.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.973
Wants to spend quality time with
his grandkids or some such bullshit.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.268
Metro could use you.

26:01.352 --> 26:05.231
It's a good section.
No more running around.

26:05.314 --> 26:06.857
I'm no editor.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.525
I'm a reporter.

26:08.609 --> 26:11.445
Yeah, well, that's what I said.
Now, look how fancy I am.

26:11.528 --> 26:13.197
-Like a damn peacock.
-[laughs]

26:14.990 --> 26:17.493
Well, I'm--
I'm just saying...

26:17.576 --> 26:19.495
be nice to keep the
wheels on the wagon.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.289
Get you a bump, better benefits.

26:22.373 --> 26:25.376
You know,
for whatever comes up.

26:26.793 --> 26:28.170
I'll think about it.

26:29.671 --> 26:32.383
Okay... [inhales]
you know where to find me.

26:35.386 --> 26:36.512
Hey.

26:39.014 --> 26:40.391
Thanks.

26:41.350 --> 26:43.435
Just let me know...

26:43.519 --> 26:45.521
next couple of days, okay?

27:20.764 --> 27:23.225
Foggy, it's me, again.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.811
Call me back.
Um, it's important.

27:43.204 --> 27:44.246
[gasps]

27:44.996 --> 27:46.665
-Shit!
-You're out of cream.

27:48.375 --> 27:52.421
Uh, yeah, I know.
It's, um-- It's on my, uh...

27:52.504 --> 27:54.548
-How did you get in here?
-Front door.

27:54.631 --> 27:55.924
You jimmied it?

27:56.007 --> 27:57.968
Unlocked.

27:58.051 --> 28:00.971
I keep telling you,
you got to be more careful.

28:01.888 --> 28:03.181
I am.

28:03.807 --> 28:05.434
No, I... I am.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.020
I was going to call you.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.647
I was out getting lunch
and I thought, "What the hell,

28:10.731 --> 28:13.484
I'll swing by the county clerk's office
and see what I can find."

28:13.567 --> 28:15.277
You gonna ask about the box?

28:17.028 --> 28:18.029
Is that yours?

28:18.113 --> 28:19.740
No, yours.

28:21.283 --> 28:23.034
Go ahead.
You've earned it.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.506
What the hell is this?

28:36.632 --> 28:38.091
Everything I have on the story.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.095
And why are you giving it to me?

28:42.178 --> 28:44.723
I used to be like you
back in the day.

28:45.682 --> 28:48.477
Good at turning heads,
getting people's attention.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.186
Pissing them off.

28:50.979 --> 28:53.274
And that's half of it.

28:53.357 --> 28:56.860
But the other half...
is knowing when not to.

28:56.943 --> 28:59.530
[scoffs] I thought that we were past this.

28:59.613 --> 29:03.784
Do-- Do I have to convince you again
just how important this is?

29:03.867 --> 29:05.411
I know how important it is, Karen.

29:05.494 --> 29:07.538
It's just not the most important.

29:08.955 --> 29:11.500
Not to me... not right now.

29:11.583 --> 29:14.961
Well, then where is this coming from?
Did something happen?

29:21.677 --> 29:24.638
-The extension didn't come through.
-Oh, Ben, I--

29:27.098 --> 29:28.850
I'm sorry.

29:31.895 --> 29:33.564
I made a few calls.

29:34.565 --> 29:37.818
This place,
I can't put her in here.

29:40.487 --> 29:42.197
No.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.866
Gonna take some time off
and bring her home.

29:49.621 --> 29:50.831
Come take a ride with me.

29:52.416 --> 29:53.500
Where?

29:54.585 --> 30:00.173
There's, um... There's a nursing home
that I just heard about upstate.

30:01.174 --> 30:03.719
Uh... I think it might change your mind.

30:04.803 --> 30:07.681
-Karen.
-No, just take a ride.

30:07.764 --> 30:11.393
Come on.
What could it hurt?

30:18.525 --> 30:20.193
Okay.

30:27.618 --> 30:28.619
[sighs]

30:29.828 --> 30:32.205
You burned him alive?

30:32.288 --> 30:34.290
Christ.

30:34.375 --> 30:36.918
I never laid a hand on Nobu.

30:37.002 --> 30:40.130
So, you maneuvered that
masked idiot to take him out.

30:40.213 --> 30:41.673
Same result.

30:42.549 --> 30:45.969
-I need you to speak with Gao.
-Me?

30:46.052 --> 30:48.597
The hell am I gonna say to her?

30:48.680 --> 30:52.058
Reassure her... everything is fine.

30:52.643 --> 30:54.060
So, you want me to lie.

30:54.144 --> 30:57.689
Mmm, you weren't
particularly fond of Nobu.

30:57.773 --> 31:01.485
You thought he was unsettling,
if I recall.

31:01.568 --> 31:05.406
I think you're unsettling half the time.
See me lighting a match?

31:05.489 --> 31:06.865
Wesley...

31:07.991 --> 31:09.785
have the car brought around.

31:11.327 --> 31:13.163
Let Vanessa know we're on our way.

31:13.246 --> 31:14.790
Sir.

31:16.958 --> 31:18.460
[Leland] This is getting out of hand.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.879
Ever since you started
seeing that woman...

31:20.962 --> 31:22.798
Leland.

31:24.090 --> 31:26.802
-You have a son, yes?
-You know I do.

31:28.053 --> 31:32.599
Which means at some point in the past,
I assume you met a woman...

31:32.683 --> 31:34.393
fell in love.

31:34.476 --> 31:37.563
-What does that have to do with this?
-Everything.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.858
Gao is right.
You've changed.

31:43.276 --> 31:44.653
Change is inevitable...

31:47.113 --> 31:49.282
for me... this city...

31:50.283 --> 31:53.745
and certain relationships.

31:59.668 --> 32:00.711
All right.

32:02.045 --> 32:04.465
All right,
I'll go speak with her.

32:05.381 --> 32:08.259
I appreciate your support in the matter.

32:08.343 --> 32:10.053
Sure, why not?

32:10.136 --> 32:12.514
We're all in this together, right?

32:14.933 --> 32:16.685
What's left of us.

32:22.649 --> 32:24.150
Yeah.

32:24.234 --> 32:26.402
Yeah, okay.
Thanks for reaching out.

32:34.285 --> 32:36.121
-That was Brett.
-What'd he say?

32:36.204 --> 32:39.583
You couldn't hear, with your...
super whatever?

32:39.666 --> 32:43.253
It doesn't work like that.
I-- I have to concentrate.

32:43.336 --> 32:45.130
Focus on letting it in.

32:45.213 --> 32:47.799
That junkie that killed Elena...

32:47.883 --> 32:49.676
-they found him.
-Good.

32:49.760 --> 32:53.096
Brett says he took a dive off the roof,
building he was shooting up in.

32:54.180 --> 32:56.099
They had to sponge him off the sidewalk.

32:56.182 --> 32:57.476
-[whispers] No.
-Did you do that?

32:58.894 --> 33:00.353
I told him to turn himself in.

33:00.436 --> 33:02.939
I can't hear your heartbeat.
Are you telling me the truth?

33:03.023 --> 33:04.440
I didn't kill him, Foggy.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.986
It's Fisk, covering his ass.

33:08.069 --> 33:11.490
So, you've never--
You've never gone that far?

33:11.573 --> 33:12.574
No.

33:15.118 --> 33:16.662
But I... I wanted to...

33:16.745 --> 33:19.247
after Elena...

33:19.330 --> 33:21.291
after everything Fisk had done, I...

33:22.417 --> 33:25.128
I went to a warehouse
I thought he'd be at.

33:27.548 --> 33:29.716
I went to kill him.

33:30.551 --> 33:32.886
It's not enough
playing judge and jury?

33:32.969 --> 33:35.013
You gotta add executioner to the list?

33:35.096 --> 33:37.015
I didn't think I had a choice.

33:37.098 --> 33:41.102
What happened to all that talk about
going after him through the system?

33:41.186 --> 33:43.063
Making the law work for us?

33:44.815 --> 33:46.775
Sometimes the law isn't enough.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.194
[Landman]
As you can see in the countersuit,

33:49.277 --> 33:52.573
not only does my client
Roxxon Energy Corporation

33:52.656 --> 33:56.827
categorically deny
any culpability in your diagnosis,

33:56.910 --> 34:00.496
but also cites clear and
actionable breach of contract

34:00.581 --> 34:02.624
regarding your decision to share details

34:02.708 --> 34:06.753
of your highly sensitive work
in the Londonderry plant.

34:06.837 --> 34:11.758
And while my client is, uh...
sympathetic towards your condition,

34:11.842 --> 34:14.385
Roxxon must vigorously defend its patents

34:14.469 --> 34:17.347
in relation to the extraction
and refinement process

34:17.430 --> 34:20.308
that you, by admission,
had intimate knowledge of.

34:20.391 --> 34:23.144
In light of this,
we will be pursuing damages.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.771
Damages?

34:25.689 --> 34:28.316
You released
sensitive information regarding--

34:28.399 --> 34:31.194
The only person
I ever told anything to was my doctor.

34:31.277 --> 34:32.613
-[heart pounding]
-[coughing]

34:33.780 --> 34:36.825
So that he could try to figure out
what was wrong with me.

34:36.908 --> 34:39.786
I didn't release anything.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.581
[continues coughing]

34:45.917 --> 34:47.127
Give us a minute.

34:53.174 --> 34:54.175
-Hey.
-Hey.

34:54.259 --> 34:56.011
-[knocks on table]
-I just bumped into Morales.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.095
Guess what he heard?

34:57.178 --> 34:58.554
They're gonna offer us the job.

34:58.639 --> 35:00.641
No more interning in a broom closet.

35:00.724 --> 35:05.020
We're each going to have our own office
with a view of... something.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.354
We did it, buddy!

35:06.437 --> 35:08.774
Glass and steel
at Landman and mother-effin' Zack...

35:08.857 --> 35:10.609
Why do you have that look on your face?

35:10.692 --> 35:11.818
Oh.

35:11.902 --> 35:13.528
-What look? I--
-You know what look.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.196
I've been reading Thurgood Marshall.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.115
Oh, shit, not Marshall.

35:17.198 --> 35:19.743
"We must dissent from the indifference.
We must dissent from the apathy.

35:19.826 --> 35:22.913
-We must dissent from..."
-"From the fear." Yeah, I know.

35:22.996 --> 35:24.580
You've read it a million times.

35:24.665 --> 35:26.582
You think what happened
in there today was right?

35:26.667 --> 35:28.334
No, Matt,
I don't think it was right.

35:28.418 --> 35:31.087
But according to the law,
if he did disclose trade secrets

35:31.171 --> 35:33.089
-to a third party other than his doctor--
-He didn't.

35:33.173 --> 35:34.549
How the hell do you know?

35:34.633 --> 35:36.677
'Cause I... I have a feeling.

35:38.344 --> 35:40.221
Last time I checked,
those are inadmissible.

35:40.305 --> 35:43.183
Is this what you want...
to be a part of that?

35:43.266 --> 35:45.601
Protecting corporations
from people that need help?

35:45.686 --> 35:46.770
It doesn't have to be like that.

35:46.853 --> 35:48.897
We get a toehold, make partner...

35:48.980 --> 35:50.982
And then in 10, 15 years,
we what?

35:51.066 --> 35:53.401
Change the system from the inside?
[scoffs]

35:53.484 --> 35:55.779
On our way to work in our Bentleys?

35:55.862 --> 36:00.491
You know how many of the other interns
would kill for a real spot here?

36:00.575 --> 36:02.744
Murder us in our sleep
without a second thought.

36:02.828 --> 36:05.496
Well, then maybe those aren't the kind
of people we should be working with.

36:06.456 --> 36:07.666
[sighs]

36:13.714 --> 36:15.048
Foggy?

36:16.257 --> 36:17.843
What are you doing?

36:17.926 --> 36:19.510
Well...

36:19.594 --> 36:23.431
I'm gonna steal as many bagels
as I can fit in this box.

36:23.514 --> 36:24.557
With you as my partner,

36:24.640 --> 36:27.018
there's no telling when I'll be able
to afford a real meal again.

36:27.102 --> 36:28.687
[Matt chuckles]

36:30.105 --> 36:31.481
We will get by.

36:31.564 --> 36:32.941
[snickers]

36:33.024 --> 36:36.027
Come on, Mother Teresa,
let's go save the world.

36:36.111 --> 36:37.570
Hey.

36:46.621 --> 36:48.289
You want to say something.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.083
Really don't.

36:53.669 --> 36:55.964
Your breathing changes
when you're about to.

36:56.757 --> 36:58.174
Now you're just showing off.

37:00.176 --> 37:01.762
Say what you need to say.

37:15.400 --> 37:18.194
Why didn't you tell me
it was that serious?

37:22.490 --> 37:24.409
Saying it means it's true.

37:28.579 --> 37:32.375
She has her good moments.
Lucid ones, you know?

37:32.458 --> 37:35.837
And she's sharp... and strong.

37:37.047 --> 37:38.339
More than me.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.259
But she always was.

37:45.013 --> 37:46.890
She was always...

37:51.227 --> 37:52.979
I'm sorry, Ben.

37:55.106 --> 37:56.232
Yeah.

37:58.819 --> 38:00.946
There's nothing worse...

38:01.029 --> 38:04.615
feeling choices are made for us.

38:04.699 --> 38:08.453
There's nothing you can do,
but swim in shit

38:08.536 --> 38:11.456
and hope you don't
get too much in your mouth.

38:14.334 --> 38:16.169
She'd like you.

38:16.252 --> 38:17.503
[scoffs]

38:18.588 --> 38:21.632
Should've taken you around
to meet her, but...

38:23.593 --> 38:24.719
Yeah.

38:25.761 --> 38:30.350
You know, we all have things
we hold onto for ourselves...

38:32.393 --> 38:33.979
that we don't want anyone to know.

38:34.770 --> 38:37.357
But there's always someone who does...

38:39.525 --> 38:41.152
sooner or later.

38:50.745 --> 38:52.413
[male attendant]
Admissions is on another tour.

38:52.497 --> 38:54.582
Shouldn't be too long.

38:54.665 --> 38:55.917
-Thanks.
-Mmm-hmm.

39:03.508 --> 39:05.426
What are we doing here?

39:06.594 --> 39:10.098
I can't afford this place.
This is a waste of time.

39:12.851 --> 39:15.103
Let's just take a look around.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.397
Maybe it'll be worth the drive.

39:22.903 --> 39:25.696
You run around dressed like a moron,
beating people up!

39:25.780 --> 39:28.699
-It's not that simple and you know it.
-No, I don't know shit.

39:28.783 --> 39:31.995
Not about this.
I mean, how--

39:32.078 --> 39:34.247
Okay, so you get these
whatever-you-call-thems

39:34.330 --> 39:35.373
when you're a kid.

39:35.456 --> 39:37.583
How do you go from that
to what you're doing now?

39:39.585 --> 39:42.255
When I was a kid,
before the accident...

39:43.214 --> 39:46.217
I'd lay awake at night
listening to the sirens.

39:46.301 --> 39:48.929
I liked to put stories to them.

39:49.012 --> 39:51.973
Trying to figure out what they were for,
ambulance or cops, robbery or fire.

39:52.057 --> 39:53.724
I don't know, just a stupid game.

39:54.893 --> 39:58.646
But after I lost my sight,
after my abilities developed,

39:58.729 --> 40:01.524
I realized how many sirens
there actually were...

40:02.733 --> 40:04.986
how much this city suffered
every single night.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.488
You've been running around
doing this since you were a kid?

40:07.572 --> 40:10.241
No. I... I tried not to fight...

40:10.325 --> 40:13.078
to make my dad proud.
To... to block it out.

40:13.744 --> 40:18.917
The sirens, the pain, the fear, all...
strangling Hell's Kitchen.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.962
For years,
I buried my head and turned away.

40:22.795 --> 40:24.255
Then one night...

40:25.131 --> 40:27.633
right after we quit Landman and Zack...

40:28.759 --> 40:31.637
-I heard it.
-Heard what?

40:32.638 --> 40:34.432
A little girl...

40:34.515 --> 40:36.935
crying in her bed,
in a building down the block.

40:37.018 --> 40:40.688
Her father liked to go to her room
late at night...

40:40.771 --> 40:42.273
when his wife was asleep.

40:43.274 --> 40:44.525
Oh, Jesus.

40:46.402 --> 40:47.988
I called Child Services...

40:48.989 --> 40:50.323
like you're supposed to.

40:51.324 --> 40:53.451
But the mom, she wouldn't believe it.

40:53.534 --> 40:57.163
Said it wasn't true.
And the dad, he was smart.

40:57.247 --> 40:58.414
[scoffs]

40:58.498 --> 41:02.668
He made sure what he did,
how he did it, didn't leave a mark.

41:04.087 --> 41:06.631
The law couldn't do anything
to help that little girl.

41:07.382 --> 41:08.383
But I could.

41:10.676 --> 41:12.428
I knew his routine.

41:14.222 --> 41:16.224
Waited till he was alone.

41:27.943 --> 41:29.404
[grunting]

41:49.132 --> 41:50.175
[panting]

41:50.258 --> 41:53.469
You touch your daughter again,
and I will know.

42:11.737 --> 42:12.947
[breathing shakily]

42:29.172 --> 42:32.383
He spent the next month in a hospital,
eating through a straw.

42:33.301 --> 42:35.010
And I never slept better.

42:36.221 --> 42:38.139
You say all this, like...

42:40.100 --> 42:42.810
one day you'd just had it
with how things are.

42:44.019 --> 42:45.855
But to do what you do...

42:46.897 --> 42:50.276
you had to keep training,
all those years since that Stick guy,

42:50.360 --> 42:52.820
knowing you would do something like this.

42:53.779 --> 42:56.574
Maybe it isn't only
about justice, Matt.

42:56.657 --> 42:59.494
Maybe it's about you
having an excuse to hit someone.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.787
Maybe you just can't stop yourself.

43:03.289 --> 43:05.040
I don't want to stop.

43:16.302 --> 43:17.720
You're very pretty.

43:18.888 --> 43:20.223
Thank you.

43:21.557 --> 43:24.102
Looks like you've
got yourself an admirer.

43:25.853 --> 43:27.480
[sighs]

43:27.563 --> 43:29.565
All the people here,

43:29.649 --> 43:33.819
all the years that they've lived,
there must be so many stories.

43:34.987 --> 43:37.323
Only thing we have,
everything said and done.

43:37.407 --> 43:41.827
No buildings named after us,
fancy inheritances to leave behind,

43:41.911 --> 43:47.875
just... the stories those who were
close to us tell to keep us alive.

43:49.169 --> 43:51.337
Even if it's just in memory.

43:52.755 --> 43:56.342
Well, maybe that's enough.

44:00.888 --> 44:01.931
[gasps softly]

44:02.014 --> 44:06.018
Hey, um, why don't we talk to somebody
that actually lives here?

44:06.101 --> 44:07.270
See what it's really like.

44:07.353 --> 44:09.063
[stammers] All right, let's get a...

44:09.772 --> 44:13.067
-Let's get an attendant or somebody.
-Or we could just knock.

44:14.860 --> 44:15.861
See?

44:16.737 --> 44:18.239
-Karen.
-[woman] Come in.

44:20.032 --> 44:21.242
She said, "Come in."

44:35.340 --> 44:36.632
Is it time?

44:37.800 --> 44:41.053
-Time for what?
-You know what.

44:43.097 --> 44:46.016
You bring it
before I go to bed every night.

44:47.101 --> 44:48.102
Oh.

44:48.603 --> 44:51.105
-I don't know you, do I?
-Oh...

44:51.188 --> 44:55.485
Uh, no. We... uh, we just...

44:55.568 --> 44:58.738
We wanted to ask you some questions.

44:58.821 --> 45:02.658
About how you like it at Saint Benezet.

45:03.743 --> 45:06.161
-It's very nice, isn't it?
-[Karen] It is.

45:06.912 --> 45:09.832
-How long have you been here?
-A while now.

45:11.251 --> 45:12.960
Ever since my husband passed.

45:14.920 --> 45:15.963
Are you two married?

45:17.298 --> 45:19.049
No.

45:19.133 --> 45:22.928
-Well, I am, but not to her.
-No, I'm single.

45:24.597 --> 45:26.266
Uh, Mrs. Vistain...

45:26.891 --> 45:28.434
Is it time?

45:29.101 --> 45:30.144
Uh...

45:30.227 --> 45:31.479
We're sorry to bother you, ma'am.

45:31.562 --> 45:32.855
-We should go.
-[stammering]

45:32.938 --> 45:36.233
Mrs. Vistain, um, your husband...

45:36.317 --> 45:39.654
-Was that your first marriage?
-Arthur?

45:40.863 --> 45:44.116
Lord, no, he was my third.

45:44.199 --> 45:47.077
Kept his name,
thought it sounded like royalty.

45:47.662 --> 45:48.954
I always loved that.

45:49.038 --> 45:51.666
Martin was my second.

45:51.749 --> 45:54.710
Such a beautiful man.

45:54.794 --> 45:56.296
But confused...

45:57.672 --> 45:59.048
by other men.

46:00.174 --> 46:01.842
Oh, um...

46:01.926 --> 46:04.554
Your first marriage...
who was that to?

46:05.846 --> 46:10.893
He tried so hard, but...
he drank, you know.

46:12.395 --> 46:13.688
I didn't.

46:14.855 --> 46:17.858
Never touched a drop.
Not once, no.

46:20.445 --> 46:24.574
And, uh... did you have any children
with your first husband?

46:24.657 --> 46:27.410
-Karen--
-Just... let her answer.

46:28.453 --> 46:29.662
Mrs. Vistain?

46:30.580 --> 46:32.039
He's such a good boy.

46:34.875 --> 46:37.044
Comes to see me every weekend.

46:38.963 --> 46:40.798
He's gentle, sweet.

46:43.133 --> 46:45.052
Not like his father.

46:45.135 --> 46:48.305
And what's his name?
Your son?

46:51.058 --> 46:52.435
Wilson.

46:53.268 --> 46:54.269
Fisk?

46:57.982 --> 46:59.359
Wilson Fisk?

47:00.526 --> 47:02.653
I haven't used that name since...

47:03.821 --> 47:05.573
It wasn't his fault.

47:07.700 --> 47:09.619
His father, he was--

47:10.953 --> 47:14.457
Wilson... just wanted him to stop.

47:15.750 --> 47:17.710
It wasn't his fault,
what he did.

47:19.169 --> 47:21.589
Mrs. Vistain,
what did your son do?

47:24.174 --> 47:29.889
There are those that question
why a man such as myself,

47:30.806 --> 47:34.226
a man who treasures his privacy,

47:34.309 --> 47:38.981
would willingly subject himself
to the public eye.

47:41.651 --> 47:46.196
I question the man
who wouldn't step forward

47:46.280 --> 47:51.577
when his city, his heart,
is in such a time of need.

47:51.661 --> 47:52.787
With your help...

47:54.163 --> 47:56.832
we can ensure that everyone...

47:57.667 --> 48:00.252
that was affected by the recent attacks,

48:00.335 --> 48:04.465
and all who call
Hell's Kitchen their home,

48:04.549 --> 48:07.134
will see a brighter day.

48:07.217 --> 48:10.888
I thank you,
and please enjoy your evening.

48:10.971 --> 48:12.765
[applause]

48:20.440 --> 48:22.525
That was beautiful.

48:22.608 --> 48:25.319
That word is meant for only you tonight.

48:29.490 --> 48:32.493
-Thank you for coming. Thank you so much.
-Of course, thank you.

48:32.577 --> 48:34.161
-It's a pleasure to see you again.
-Nice to see you.

48:36.456 --> 48:38.165
Thank you so much for the donation.

48:38.248 --> 48:40.460
It means the world to me,
and to my organization.

48:40.543 --> 48:41.627
Yeah, mmm-hmm.

48:45.631 --> 48:49.760
I haven't been in a room with so many
deep pockets since the junk bond days.

48:49.844 --> 48:52.555
Leland, I was starting to worry.

48:52.638 --> 48:54.306
It's taken care of.

48:54.389 --> 48:56.058
Appreciate it.

48:56.141 --> 48:57.560
Yeah, great.

48:57.643 --> 49:01.146
So, does anybody
need a drink as bad as I do?

49:01.230 --> 49:02.773
[Vanessa] Yes, please.

49:04.734 --> 49:07.612
It was a hell of a speech, Fisk.
You ever think about running for office?

49:07.695 --> 49:09.989
I'll leave that to
people like you, Senator.

49:10.072 --> 49:11.949
[chuckles] That's a good answer.

49:12.032 --> 49:15.160
You, um... got a minute
to talk about that zoning issue?

49:15.244 --> 49:16.621
Yes, of course.

49:17.830 --> 49:19.832
I'll be back in a minute.

49:23.753 --> 49:25.546
I didn't vote for
Senator Cherryh last election.

49:25.630 --> 49:26.839
[Fisk] Thank you so much.

49:26.922 --> 49:28.674
Few people did.

49:28.758 --> 49:30.425
[Leland] But he still won.

49:30.510 --> 49:33.178
He said it was because of the
advice he got from Van Lunt

49:33.262 --> 49:36.974
and his crackpot astrologer,
if you can believe that.

49:37.057 --> 49:38.809
Van Lunt?

49:38.893 --> 49:42.104
Yeah, he's the guy who...
owns this mausoleum.

49:42.187 --> 49:47.735
Ask me, has more to do with Cherryh
having his fingers in all the right holes.

49:47.818 --> 49:48.819
-[clattering]
-[man grunting]

49:48.903 --> 49:50.655
-[woman screaming]
-[people murmuring]

49:50.738 --> 49:52.322
[people speaking indistinctly]

49:52.406 --> 49:53.699
Somebody can't hold his liquor.

49:55.159 --> 49:56.702
[people gasping]

49:56.786 --> 49:57.787
What the hell is this?

49:57.870 --> 49:59.288
[all clamoring]

49:59.371 --> 50:00.706
[people screaming]

50:03.751 --> 50:06.671
Wesley, get the car.
We need to leave... now.

50:09.590 --> 50:10.883
Vanessa!

50:13.427 --> 50:16.346
[Leland] Christ!
Somebody get a doctor here!

50:16.430 --> 50:17.723
Somebody get a doctor!

50:19.141 --> 50:20.392
Vanessa?

50:26.857 --> 50:28.358
Vanessa!

50:31.278 --> 50:32.487
Vanessa!

50:39.286 --> 50:41.956
You're going to get yourself killed,
you keep this up.

50:42.039 --> 50:43.583
You know that, right?

50:45.500 --> 50:46.961
I can take care of myself.

50:48.503 --> 50:49.964
What about the rest of us?

50:51.006 --> 50:53.383
Me, Karen...

50:53.467 --> 50:56.261
we're a part of this now,
because of you.

50:56.345 --> 50:58.222
And we didn't get a say in that.

50:58.305 --> 51:01.642
What do you think's gonna happen
if I give up now, Foggy?

51:01.726 --> 51:04.937
-Who's going to stop Fisk?
-Oh, I don't know... the law?

51:05.020 --> 51:06.521
Tell that to Elena.

51:06.606 --> 51:08.232
[sighs]

51:08.315 --> 51:12.862
If you could have put on a mask
and prevented what happened to her...

51:12.945 --> 51:15.698
-you telling me you wouldn't have?
-It's not fair, Matt.

51:15.781 --> 51:17.532
We don't live in a world that's fair.

51:17.617 --> 51:19.409
We live in this one.

51:19.493 --> 51:22.246
And I'm doing everything I can
to make it a better place.

51:22.329 --> 51:23.873
"A better place."

51:28.085 --> 51:30.170
That kind of sounds like
what Fisk keeps saying.

51:30.254 --> 51:31.964
Don't say that.
Don't twist it around.

51:32.047 --> 51:35.718
You tried to kill him, Matt.
You told me yourself.

51:35.801 --> 51:38.763
How is that any different than
the way he solves his problems?

51:38.846 --> 51:41.181
I made a mistake.
I know that.

51:42.141 --> 51:44.727
Misspelling "Hanukkah" is a mistake.

51:45.895 --> 51:48.147
Attempted murder
is a little something else.

51:48.939 --> 51:53.152
You ever stop to think what would happen
if you went to jail? Or worse?

51:53.944 --> 51:56.989
You really think that anyone would believe
that I didn't know what you were doing?

51:57.072 --> 51:59.283
-[sobbing]
-That Karen didn't know?

51:59.366 --> 52:02.662
This city needs me in that mask, Foggy.

52:03.620 --> 52:04.705
Maybe you're right.

52:07.082 --> 52:08.668
Maybe it does.

52:09.710 --> 52:11.086
But I don't.

52:13.047 --> 52:15.716
I only ever needed my friend.

52:18.844 --> 52:22.181
I wouldn't have kept this from you, Matt.
Not from you.

52:22.264 --> 52:25.059
You don't know that.
You don't know that.

52:25.142 --> 52:28.478
Yeah, I do.

52:32.692 --> 52:35.027
Foggy... wait.

52:35.110 --> 52:36.111
[groans]

52:36.195 --> 52:37.321
Foggy.

52:40.115 --> 52:41.116
[sighs]

52:43.118 --> 52:44.119
[door closes]

52:49.541 --> 52:51.711
[Foggy] I worry about you,
it's all I'm saying.

52:51.794 --> 52:54.714
-Foggy, I'm fine.
-Don't look fine.

52:54.797 --> 52:56.215
[Foggy]
See, Josie's worried about you too.

52:56.298 --> 53:00.219
-I wouldn't go that far.
-Gotta be more careful.

53:00.302 --> 53:02.012
I know. I know.

53:02.096 --> 53:04.890
Tripping and falling taking out the trash.

53:05.808 --> 53:07.101
You got to get someone
to do that for you.

53:07.184 --> 53:09.603
Come on, I just need to be
more careful, like you said.

53:11.188 --> 53:12.689
Done!

53:12.773 --> 53:15.692
Run your feelers over this little beauty.

53:15.776 --> 53:17.402
What is it, a napkin?

53:17.486 --> 53:20.447
No, my friend, this is our future.

53:20.530 --> 53:23.826
-Huh, feels like a napkin.
-It's a drawing of a sign.

53:24.618 --> 53:27.621
"Nelson and Murdock,
Attorneys At Law."

53:30.249 --> 53:33.418
You, uh... You really want to do this?

53:33.502 --> 53:36.881
No, I'm pissing my pants.
There is actual urine in my trousers.

53:36.964 --> 53:38.465
[laughs]

53:39.508 --> 53:41.635
But I trust you.

53:41.718 --> 53:44.138
You think this is what
we should be doing...

53:44.221 --> 53:45.389
then I'm with you.

53:46.431 --> 53:47.599
For better or worse.

53:47.682 --> 53:50.060
Sounds like we're getting married.

53:50.144 --> 53:52.646
This is way more important
than a civil union!

53:52.729 --> 53:54.606
Come on,
we're gonna be business partners.

53:54.689 --> 53:56.233
We're gonna share
everything with each other.

53:56.316 --> 54:00.112
Our thoughts, our dreams,
bills, crushing debt...

54:01.822 --> 54:05.409
There is no one I'd rather
be doing this with, buddy. Seriously.

54:05.492 --> 54:07.119
Me, too, pal.

54:08.078 --> 54:11.748
Now raise your damn glass,
'cause I'm gonna clink the hell out of it.

54:12.666 --> 54:14.877
Nelson and Murdock,
Attorneys at Law.

54:14.960 --> 54:16.711
Nelson and Murdock.

54:17.421 --> 54:19.173
[both laughing]

54:57.461 --> 54:59.463
[slow music playing]
