37:02.595 --> 37:05.269
When is the last time you had a good cry?

37:05.432 --> 37:07.275
It can be incredibly cathartic.

37:07.434 --> 37:10.438
But it's gonna make you
all the wrong kinds of friends in prison.

37:12.564 --> 37:16.068
You know, you should've seen your face
when I called you a murderer.

37:16.234 --> 37:21.832
I mean, you were shocked, but there
was a part of you that welcomed it.

37:23.283 --> 37:26.287
- Because you know it's true.
- Where's Mark Gray?

37:26.453 --> 37:28.626
Such a sad story.

37:29.622 --> 37:33.297
- His family was killed by you and your friends.
- Yeah, what do you care?

37:33.460 --> 37:36.430
Huh? What's Mark to you?

37:52.103 --> 37:55.653
Thank you for coming.
I didn't know who else to call.

38:04.491 --> 38:07.961
I'm a sucker for a good revenge tale.
But this?

38:08.119 --> 38:11.714
Ha, ha. This is gonna be so much more.

38:12.373 --> 38:13.841
You have no idea what's coming.

38:14.834 --> 38:19.965
Okay, so this moment may be new
to you, but I've sat in this chair...

38:20.131 --> 38:22.008
...and I've had this very conversation.

38:22.175 --> 38:26.305
And the guy I had it with is on death row
and I'm still here.

38:27.013 --> 38:30.893
So you can spare me
the scary proclamations.

38:31.476 --> 38:33.194
Do you have the time?

38:34.020 --> 38:35.693
Got someplace you gotta be?

38:37.357 --> 38:38.904
No.

38:40.485 --> 38:41.532
But you do.

39:52.432 --> 39:56.562
- Hey, stop it.
- We have to go home. The FBI got Andrew.

39:56.728 --> 39:59.447
- How long before they get us?
- Calm down, Daisy.

39:59.606 --> 40:02.780
If we leave here before we finish,
what do you think's gonna happen?

40:02.942 --> 40:05.286
Everything we have will be gone.

40:05.445 --> 40:08.164
We'll spend the rest
of our short lives on the run.

40:08.323 --> 40:12.749
- He'll make sure of it.
- Mark has no idea what's really going on.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.585
And we need to make sure it stays that way.

41:44.335 --> 41:46.588
I'm so glad you called me.

41:47.338 --> 41:48.806
Me too.

41:50.925 --> 41:52.051
I'm sorry.

41:55.013 --> 41:59.359
- I shouldn't have pressured you earlier.
- No. You were right.

41:59.517 --> 42:01.235
I was pushing you away.

42:01.394 --> 42:06.400
It's my pattern
and, uh, I don't wanna do it anymore.

42:09.527 --> 42:10.574
I need you.

42:13.114 --> 42:15.537
I need you too.

42:36.095 --> 42:37.938
Today was hard.

42:39.474 --> 42:41.772
But you really helped me get through it.

42:43.269 --> 42:45.067
You did great.

42:46.272 --> 42:47.990
I'm proud of you.

42:54.864 --> 42:56.366
Thanks.

42:57.950 --> 42:59.167
Tomorrow will be easier.

42:59.368 --> 43:00.494
Are you kidding me?

43:00.661 --> 43:02.584
Tomorrow will be awesome.

43:02.747 --> 43:06.968
Because tomorrow, one of them dies.

43:10.213 --> 43:12.307
Mm. Heh.
