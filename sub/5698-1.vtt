<i>You know that evil Heavy Metal
that your parents hate you listening to?</i>

00:30.629 --> 00:34.149
<i>You know those lyrics
about hell and doom,</i>

00:34.249 --> 00:37.602
<i>demons ripping you new orifices
to shit out of?</i>

00:38.549 --> 00:41.591
<i>But what if I told you it's all real?</i>

00:42.606 --> 00:44.553
<i>I know...</i>

00:46.259 --> 00:48.274
<i>I was there.</i>

01:24.376 --> 01:27.392
<i>But wait... let's start
at the beginning.</i>

01:28.312 --> 01:30.648
<i>It all started in Greypoint,</i>

01:30.748 --> 01:33.686
<i>the middle of ass-fuck nowhere.</i>

01:35.083 --> 01:38.253
<i>I had to shift here after my mum
went on a massive meth bender,</i>

01:38.353 --> 01:42.401
<i>and tried to suck off a Santa Claus
in a crowded mall.</i>

01:44.055 --> 01:45.944
<i>Mum got sent to a mental ward.</i>

01:46.324 --> 01:48.905
<i>And I got stuck with my Uncle.</i>

02:00.586 --> 02:04.503
<i>My Uncle Albert
was balls deep into Jesus.</i>

02:08.275 --> 02:09.977
<i>He thought Ricky Martin was heavy.</i>

02:10.077 --> 02:12.212
<i>He heard me cranking
some Disemboweled Corpse,</i>

02:12.312 --> 02:14.133
<i>and he hasn't slept for days.</i>

02:17.915 --> 02:21.719
<i>I brought about the end of the world.
Biggest dick move ever.</i>

02:21.819 --> 02:23.654
Stop struggling.

02:24.254 --> 02:26.122
It won't fit.

02:26.222 --> 02:27.894
- Get up there.
- <i>This is Dion.</i>

02:27.994 --> 02:30.492
<i>And that is probably the least
embarrassing orifice</i>

02:30.592 --> 02:32.361
<i>that dice has been shoved into.</i>

02:32.961 --> 02:35.196
Wait... Yes, it's in!

02:35.296 --> 02:37.887
- <i>And this is my dickhead cousin.</i>
- Hey, David.

02:38.237 --> 02:41.101
<i>He's hospitalized
more nerds than asthma.</i>

02:41.201 --> 02:43.153
I saw Uncle Albert washing
your sheets this morning.

02:43.253 --> 02:46.205
- You shit the bed or something?
- Fuckin' devil-worshiper.

02:46.305 --> 02:48.306
I can't wait until my dad
kicks you out on the streets

02:48.406 --> 02:51.842
and you've got to blow truck drivers
for food like your psycho mum.

02:52.301 --> 02:54.490
His mum is a psycho.

02:59.781 --> 03:01.829
You all right, man?

03:03.016 --> 03:07.353
- Here's your dice.
- It's actually a die. Dice is plural.

03:07.453 --> 03:10.281
And it's a D10. But...

03:10.888 --> 03:12.503
Thanks.

03:14.458 --> 03:19.027
- Jesus. Who's that?
- Oh, Medina Darcy.

03:19.127 --> 03:22.247
<i>Number one cause
of awkward boners in Greypoint.</i>

03:24.583 --> 03:27.868
- No dude.
- What do you mean "no"?

03:27.968 --> 03:31.237
No way. Chicks like that,
they don't go out with metalheads.

03:31.337 --> 03:33.290
They bang apes like your cousin.

03:34.738 --> 03:36.157
Forget her, man.

03:36.257 --> 03:38.192
At lunchtime,

03:38.342 --> 03:43.248
do you want to do something
completely badass?

03:51.186 --> 03:54.522
And that's... eight points
of non-lethal damage.

03:54.622 --> 03:57.228
Exceeds your HP;
your cleric is unconscious.

03:57.328 --> 04:01.512
No fucking way. How is it
still breathing? I cast a fireball.

04:01.612 --> 04:04.214
You cast it at a Fire troll.

04:04.314 --> 04:07.817
- It's immune to fire.
- This is bullshit.

04:07.917 --> 04:12.454
<i>Well, that's Giles. He was once suspended
for violating the CPR training dummy.</i>

04:12.554 --> 04:17.071
I'm the DM, Giles.
What I say goes, okay? I am the law.

04:17.171 --> 04:19.291
- This is your problem, Dion.
- Okay.

04:19.392 --> 04:22.261
- This is why no woman will talk to you.
- Hey, do you know what?

04:22.361 --> 04:25.831
A whole family of goblins has just
amassed around your dead body.

04:25.931 --> 04:28.199
And one of them is humping your foot.
How do you like that?

04:28.299 --> 04:29.746
How...

04:50.265 --> 04:53.413
- Fuckin' nerds.
- Oh, Jesus.

04:56.819 --> 04:58.714
It's piss.

04:58.814 --> 05:02.224
They sprayed us with piss. Again!

05:02.324 --> 05:05.961
Oh, the Player's Guide
is totally ruined.

05:06.061 --> 05:09.931
<i>My friends are losers. My uncle keeps
trying to christen me in my sleep,</i>

05:10.031 --> 05:12.366
<i>and I'm drenched
in my cousin's bodily fluids.</i>

05:12.466 --> 05:14.748
X minus one...

05:16.401 --> 05:18.884
X plus one...

05:24.174 --> 05:28.011
Good work, Brodie. Nice technique.

05:28.111 --> 05:30.960
Great shading on the demon penises.

05:32.414 --> 05:36.317
Is that me having hot pokers
stuffed up my rectum by skeletons?

05:36.417 --> 05:39.119
- Yes, sir.
- Nice likeness.

05:39.219 --> 05:42.384
Very detailed. Two weeks detention.

05:48.625 --> 05:49.560
Silence!

05:49.660 --> 05:52.729
<i>So, that's me. Brodie.</i>

05:53.730 --> 05:55.577
<i>Fuck my life.</i>

06:00.666 --> 06:03.049
Fucking late again.

06:07.172 --> 06:10.276
Oh, Christ,
it's my Satanist cousin, Brodie.

06:10.376 --> 06:13.979
Look at that ugly loner.
I'm gonna make his life hell on earth.

06:14.363 --> 06:17.269
That's really cool, David.
Can you please take me home now?

06:18.449 --> 06:20.317
I thought we'd take
a drive or something.

06:20.417 --> 06:25.639
Okay, it's hard to believe, but talking
about bullying isn't really a turn on.

06:28.323 --> 06:30.893
<i>There was only one
cool thing about Greypoint...</i>

06:30.993 --> 06:32.661
<i>Alien Records.</i>

06:32.761 --> 06:36.030
<i>Byron sold the sickest vinyl,
while his psychic girlfriend, Abigail,</i>

06:36.130 --> 06:38.770
<i>told fortunes to bored housewives.</i>

06:40.698 --> 06:44.701
Welcome to Alien records.
How are things, kid?

06:45.501 --> 06:47.600
Things are shitty.

06:49.504 --> 06:52.974
- Check it out.
- Oh, Haxan Sword? Epic.

06:53.074 --> 06:56.043
Yeah, man,
it's only one of 666 ever printed,

06:56.143 --> 07:00.980
numbered in blood
by Rikki Daggers himself.

07:01.080 --> 07:04.663
Metal vinyl's over there by that kid.

07:42.315 --> 07:44.085
Fuck, yes.

07:44.185 --> 07:46.787
- Now that's a record, man.
- Yeah.

07:47.287 --> 07:49.389
I've actually been after
that one for a while.

07:49.689 --> 07:52.071
I'm Brodie, by the way.

07:56.395 --> 08:00.265
- Zakk.
- <i>After I met Zakk, my life changed.</i>

08:00.565 --> 08:03.534
My mother was gonna
call me Storm though.

08:03.634 --> 08:06.504
- Rad.
- I know.

08:07.104 --> 08:10.639
<i>He was a tornado of chaos,
leaving a trail of destruction</i>

08:10.739 --> 08:13.600
<i>and teen pregnancies in his wake.</i>

08:14.654 --> 08:17.361
<i>Zakk got expelled after
stabbing a kid with a math compass</i>

08:17.461 --> 08:19.496
<i>because he stepped
on his King Diamond tape.</i>

08:20.546 --> 08:22.225
<i>Or was it a setsquare?</i>

08:23.882 --> 08:25.784
<i>He used to help his dad
at the car workshop.</i>

08:25.884 --> 08:30.540
<i>But mainly he just stole anything
not bolted on and then unbolted the rest.</i>

08:30.640 --> 08:33.035
Yeah. Fuck you too, Bono.

08:35.857 --> 08:37.659
Hey, man...

08:37.760 --> 08:39.995
you want to do something crazy?

08:40.095 --> 08:42.464
It's not role-playing is it?

08:42.563 --> 08:45.106
What the fuck is role-playing?

08:59.343 --> 09:03.020
<i>Zakk played bass so we started a band.</i>

09:04.480 --> 09:06.816
Hey. This is... Giles and Dion.

09:06.916 --> 09:09.464
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:13.688 --> 09:16.390
Right, first things first.
What are we called?

09:17.154 --> 09:20.056
- Murder Boner?
- Toothed Vagina.

09:20.156 --> 09:22.261
Oh, Maggot Sperm.

09:22.361 --> 09:23.762
Cannibal Unicorn.

09:23.862 --> 09:27.698
How about like, thirteen S's.
You know, like...

09:29.300 --> 09:32.636
Got it. Got it. DEATHGASM.

09:32.736 --> 09:36.238
All spelled in capitals.
Lower case is for pussies.

09:36.338 --> 09:38.073
Cool. What about...

09:38.173 --> 09:40.542
I fuckin' said...

09:40.942 --> 09:42.558
DEATHGASM!

09:55.521 --> 09:58.087
Solo. Fuckin' shred it.

10:12.336 --> 10:16.973
- Dude, I thought you said you could play.
- Sorry. I can. I can.

10:17.073 --> 10:19.575
I'm just... I'm... I'm just rusty.

10:20.075 --> 10:22.790
All right. From the top.

10:31.716 --> 10:34.565
What? Just mixing it up.

10:42.056 --> 10:45.039
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

10:49.663 --> 10:53.113
- What the hell is that for?
- Dude, chill out. It's fine.

11:00.254 --> 11:03.046
All right. You stay here.

11:10.513 --> 11:12.449
You're lookout.

11:12.549 --> 11:14.263
What?

11:23.423 --> 11:25.195
Shit.

12:05.462 --> 12:07.290
Zakk?

12:28.817 --> 12:29.892
Zakk?

12:30.793 --> 12:32.800
Oh, shit!

12:34.856 --> 12:36.870
Did you shit yourself?

12:37.558 --> 12:39.463
Nice surprise.

12:39.563 --> 12:44.021
You're an accomplice, mate.
Don't puss out on me now. Come on.

12:44.121 --> 12:46.132
Check it out.

12:46.907 --> 12:48.779
Shit.

12:49.702 --> 12:52.304
Man, these guys were legends
back in the day.

12:52.404 --> 12:54.361
Check it out.

12:55.606 --> 12:57.314
Rikki Daggers.

12:57.414 --> 13:01.577
He was a maniac. Didn't he used to kill
live rabbits on stage with a crowbar?

13:02.177 --> 13:04.792
No, man. It was a claw hammer.

13:06.846 --> 13:09.249
Wonder what happened to him?

13:09.349 --> 13:13.052
Spent all his money on coke,
hookers and Satanist shit.

13:13.452 --> 13:17.772
Last I heard he was hiding out in some
small, crappy New Zealand town.

13:22.125 --> 13:25.729
- No fuckin' way.
- Yes fuckin' way.

13:25.829 --> 13:29.717
- No fuckin' way.
- Rikki Fuckin' Daggers, man.

13:32.358 --> 13:34.617
Hey, this way.

13:43.144 --> 13:45.314
Holy fuck. Look at those amps.

13:45.414 --> 13:48.830
No, they're old as hell;
probably all busted.

13:52.585 --> 13:54.287
Is that...?

13:54.387 --> 13:57.289
It's him. Is he dead?

13:57.389 --> 13:59.957
- I bag that record.
- Dude, that's low.

14:00.057 --> 14:02.305
I can go much lower.

14:40.959 --> 14:42.514
Come on.

14:42.614 --> 14:46.430
- Check it out.
- No fuckin' way.

14:46.530 --> 14:48.563
Motherfucker!

14:48.663 --> 14:52.535
- Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude...
- The record... drop it.

14:53.435 --> 14:55.504
Kick it to me.

14:57.135 --> 14:59.967
- Right. What the fuck...
- Chill.

15:00.067 --> 15:03.984
...are you two cunts doing in my house?

15:04.084 --> 15:07.024
- Let's get out of here. Come on.
- Don't you fuckin' move.

15:07.124 --> 15:09.779
Aeon sent you, didn't he?

15:10.717 --> 15:15.137
When are you occultist cunts
ever gonna fuckin learn?

15:15.237 --> 15:17.372
No, we're just... we're just metalheads.

15:17.472 --> 15:19.474
We're fans.

15:21.324 --> 15:23.427
Well, how did you find me?

15:23.527 --> 15:26.596
Latest Death Scream, dude.
You were outed.

15:26.696 --> 15:28.743
Oh, fuck.

15:29.465 --> 15:31.746
Fuck!

15:34.868 --> 15:37.117
We're all gonna die.

15:52.953 --> 15:55.434
Shit. Someone's coming.

16:00.892 --> 16:03.428
Here. Take it. Take it!

16:03.828 --> 16:06.931
Hide it and guard it with your life.

16:07.031 --> 16:09.546
- Come on, let's bail. Let's bail.
- Fuck.

16:20.542 --> 16:23.663
So you fuckers finally found me.

16:23.763 --> 16:26.033
Where is it, Daggers?

16:36.654 --> 16:38.958
Who were you talking to?

16:39.491 --> 16:40.658
I heard voices.

16:40.758 --> 16:45.724
Why don't you go home
and tell Aeon to fuck himself!

16:50.845 --> 16:52.801
It's a trap.

16:52.901 --> 16:57.141
Well, go on then, do it,
you fuckin' pussy.

17:16.857 --> 17:19.137
Well, that was fucked up.

17:22.259 --> 17:26.782
Dude, what the hell?
It's a fucking Rick Astley record!

17:28.198 --> 17:29.779
Fuck.

17:32.868 --> 17:36.050
- What the hell was that?
- Weird.

17:38.538 --> 17:40.240
It's music.

17:40.340 --> 17:43.523
- Can you read it?
- Yeah, I think so. It's pretty universal.

17:44.676 --> 17:47.058
It's really old.

17:47.911 --> 17:49.814
Holy fuck.

17:50.114 --> 17:52.882
- Look at the title.
- What the fuck does it say?

17:52.982 --> 17:56.652
- I don't know, I think it's Latin.
- What, like, Dora the fuckin' Explorer?

17:56.752 --> 17:59.388
No. Like, Romans and shit.

17:59.788 --> 18:03.625
Dude... we should learn this,
turn it into a DEATHGASM song!

18:03.725 --> 18:05.885
It'll be fuckin' brutal.

18:06.494 --> 18:09.217
- You want a beer?
- Yeah.

18:31.949 --> 18:33.775
Vadin.

18:36.152 --> 18:38.488
- I found Daggers.
- Straight to it?

18:38.588 --> 18:41.424
Not even a, "How are things, Aeon?"

18:41.524 --> 18:44.493
You're direct.
I've always liked that about you.

18:44.593 --> 18:48.630
- Aeon, the pages.
- The Black Hymn, Vadin.

18:48.730 --> 18:52.066
Pages are just paper.
The Black Hymn is absolute power.

18:52.166 --> 18:55.402
Please, give it the reverence
it deserves.

18:55.502 --> 18:58.371
Daggers didn't have it, The Black Hymn.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.473
I think someone got to it before us.

19:03.374 --> 19:05.656
That's a shame.

19:06.142 --> 19:08.045
There was a break in.

19:08.145 --> 19:13.061
The pages should be in Greypoint
somewhere. I just need more time.

19:18.518 --> 19:22.820
Winners don't make excuses
for their failures, Vadin.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.825
- They learn from them.
- No. Please.

19:25.925 --> 19:28.940
- Take his fucking head off.
- No!

19:31.628 --> 19:35.732
Oh, come on, that's a custom made
Sartori rug, idiots.

19:35.832 --> 19:38.935
You put a tarp down first.

19:39.035 --> 19:41.082
Do it again.

19:42.803 --> 19:46.487
Again! Do it again!

20:02.688 --> 20:04.691
That's good.

20:04.791 --> 20:07.205
Yeah, I think that worked.

20:10.762 --> 20:13.777
Get the car,
we're heading into Greypoint.

20:24.840 --> 20:30.858
Zakk, Zakk, that's good. Brodie,
can you put your foot up on that tree?

20:31.911 --> 20:35.439
Yeah. But... but higher. Higher.

20:35.539 --> 20:38.183
This is retarded. Our instruments
aren't even plugged in.

20:38.283 --> 20:40.164
Where the fuck is the sound
meant to be coming from?

20:40.264 --> 20:43.349
Trust me, this is gonna be off the hook.

20:43.954 --> 20:45.995
Yeah, yeah. No, that's good.

20:46.095 --> 20:48.946
Let's head to the next location.

20:55.887 --> 20:57.078
Fuck you, Dion.

21:39.905 --> 21:41.507
Does anybody want anything
from the shop?

21:41.607 --> 21:45.010
Condoms, Vaseline,
jumper cables and ammonium nitrate.

21:45.110 --> 21:47.812
I don't think they sell
that combination of things.

21:48.712 --> 21:50.014
See...

21:50.114 --> 21:52.695
Sorry. Sorry.

21:54.016 --> 21:56.131
There you go.

21:58.752 --> 22:01.301
Could I please have my tampon?

22:01.921 --> 22:05.070
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

22:05.490 --> 22:08.126
- You're Brodie, right?
- Yeah.

22:08.226 --> 22:10.795
I'm Medina, from maths class.

22:10.895 --> 22:14.544
Right, you're David's girlfriend, right?

22:14.764 --> 22:18.644
You know what, I was gonna get
an ice cream. Did you want one?

22:18.902 --> 22:23.120
Yeah. I was just helping these guys...

22:25.574 --> 22:30.480
We're... we're all done here.
Dude... catch you later.

22:31.180 --> 22:33.476
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Cool.

22:37.016 --> 22:39.432
Sperminate her, dude!

22:59.371 --> 23:04.777
So... the other day, in maths...
Mr. Capenhurst is such a dick.

23:05.677 --> 23:07.545
- Yeah.
- Yep.

23:07.645 --> 23:11.461
I... I saved this.
Well, I rescued it from the bin.

23:12.815 --> 23:16.169
You're a really good drawer, like, really
talented. I wish I could draw like that.

23:16.269 --> 23:20.034
Okay. Thank you. Thanks.

23:25.093 --> 23:30.231
You know, I was thinking about getting
a tattoo, it would drive my dad crazy.

23:30.997 --> 23:33.478
I should get you to design it.

23:35.332 --> 23:37.247
- Maybe that's lame.
- No, of course.

23:37.347 --> 23:41.985
I mean, of course I would help you
design it. Not of course I think it's lame.

23:43.574 --> 23:45.322
Okay.

23:46.388 --> 23:48.852
You know, I was thinking
about getting it just...

23:49.546 --> 23:50.915
just here.

23:52.015 --> 23:53.996
Yes.

23:54.096 --> 23:58.573
- Good spot for it.
- Or maybe here, on my upper thigh.

23:58.673 --> 24:00.621
Yeah. Yes, yeah.

24:00.721 --> 24:04.057
Either... I mean, again,
both great areas... places.

24:04.157 --> 24:06.558
And hard decision.

24:08.492 --> 24:10.241
So.

24:12.896 --> 24:16.083
- So, you're in a band?
- Yeah, I play... the guitar.

24:16.183 --> 24:18.718
I mean, axe.

24:20.030 --> 24:22.828
Do you... do you like metal?

24:22.928 --> 24:26.841
Isn't it just a bunch of guys screaming?

24:26.941 --> 24:31.540
No way. Well, apart from grindcore.

24:31.640 --> 24:35.082
And... death metal is kind of like that.

24:35.182 --> 24:37.951
And deathcore, screamo, pornogrind,

24:38.051 --> 24:41.520
black metal, mathcore, thrash
and mordorcore. But apart from those.

24:41.620 --> 24:43.788
It's just not my thing.

24:43.888 --> 24:46.193
I don't really get it.

24:48.056 --> 24:53.122
It's like, when life sucks,
and you feel alone and empty.

24:53.222 --> 24:56.097
You stick on some metal
and life is better, because...

24:56.197 --> 24:58.933
because somebody else knows the pain

24:59.033 --> 25:02.798
and the rage that you're
going through, you know?

25:11.642 --> 25:13.844
I'll lend you a CD.

25:14.444 --> 25:17.021
You should... you should
have a... have a listen.

25:28.553 --> 25:30.632
Anal cunt.

25:31.522 --> 25:33.164
This one.

25:43.865 --> 25:47.769
Awesome. These are really, really old.

25:47.869 --> 25:49.570
How are they not in a museum?

25:49.670 --> 25:52.539
Where did you say
you got these again, dude?

25:52.639 --> 25:55.208
- I...
- Found them...

25:55.308 --> 25:57.357
in a skip.

26:25.466 --> 26:29.082
I'm warning you, Brodie.
Stop that devil music now.

27:38.766 --> 27:40.248
Shit, man.

27:51.909 --> 27:53.745
Laters, bud.

27:53.845 --> 27:55.947
Dude, you choked again.

27:56.047 --> 27:58.961
Sorry, I... started panicking.

27:59.681 --> 28:01.816
You ever had that feeling
where you can't breathe?

28:01.916 --> 28:05.419
Like there's a crushing weight on your
chest, and the room gets really small

28:05.519 --> 28:08.021
and your heart starts
beating insanely fast?

28:08.121 --> 28:10.360
No, I never had that.

28:10.644 --> 28:13.625
Oh, Although this one time,
this chick grabbed my nuts too hard,

28:13.725 --> 28:15.806
and my splooge came out red.

28:18.894 --> 28:21.009
Brotherhood of Steel?

28:21.129 --> 28:23.065
Brotherhood of Steel.

28:23.265 --> 28:25.213
Laters.

29:25.720 --> 29:29.136
The expression...

29:30.625 --> 29:32.898
three A...

29:32.998 --> 29:38.268
plus two B over two.

29:38.963 --> 29:44.302
When A equals three...

29:44.402 --> 29:46.300
and...

29:46.900 --> 29:50.982
B equals four.

29:54.076 --> 29:55.822
Anyway...

30:19.665 --> 30:23.148
- Hey, cuz.
- The fuck do you want?

30:26.170 --> 30:27.571
Fuck.

30:27.771 --> 30:31.327
- Get him.
- Get the fuck off, David.

30:31.427 --> 30:33.914
What are you gonna do about it,
fudge packer? Tell my dad?

30:34.014 --> 30:36.142
- He hates you too.
- Fuck.

30:36.242 --> 30:39.464
You go near my bitch again and
I'll punch you in the dick every morning.

30:39.564 --> 30:41.540
Fucktard.

30:41.640 --> 30:44.147
- Rip Brodie's girlie earring out.
- No.

30:44.247 --> 30:46.962
No! No, no, no...

30:57.590 --> 30:59.637
Come on. Lay into him.

31:14.537 --> 31:16.440
Are you stealing petrol?

31:16.540 --> 31:19.489
No. I'm stealing diesel.

31:20.275 --> 31:21.824
Well, don't you feel guilty?

31:24.378 --> 31:26.793
No. Hold that.

31:28.447 --> 31:30.717
You're Zakk, right? Brodie's friend?

31:30.817 --> 31:34.453
He... do you know where he is?
He skipped class this afternoon.

31:34.653 --> 31:36.522
Brodie?

31:37.022 --> 31:39.324
Oh, yeah. He lost his dick
in a freak bandsaw accident.

31:40.664 --> 31:41.991
Tragic.

31:42.091 --> 31:43.806
Okay.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.110
Well.

31:51.966 --> 31:54.034
Can you give him this?

31:56.035 --> 31:58.083
Don't read it.

32:53.554 --> 32:55.289
Zakk?

32:55.389 --> 32:57.323
Where's Brodie?

32:58.023 --> 32:59.945
He told me to pass on a message.

33:01.659 --> 33:05.475
He's not interested.
He's got other shit going on.

33:12.400 --> 33:15.670
- Well, that's shit.
- Yeah.

33:15.770 --> 33:18.205
Well, I thought
I'd come down and tell you.

33:18.305 --> 33:21.566
Save you waiting all night,
freezing your tits off.

33:23.437 --> 33:27.045
Well, thank you for considering
the well-being of my tits.

33:27.145 --> 33:28.960
You're welcome.

33:30.513 --> 33:32.214
Here.

33:32.314 --> 33:34.362
You're freezing.

33:43.288 --> 33:47.111
Swig? Helps take the bullshit away.

33:50.493 --> 33:52.275
Fuck it.

33:55.130 --> 33:57.645
<i>His mum is a psycho.</i>

35:13.035 --> 35:14.971
Are you gonna tell us
who gave you the shiner?

35:15.071 --> 35:18.140
Won't matter soon.
Let's just fuckin' do this.

35:18.240 --> 35:21.876
Dude, you know I have your back.
Tell me who they are, I'll fuck them up.

35:21.976 --> 35:23.845
I'm fine.

35:24.245 --> 35:27.280
All right. Well, if they give you
any more shit, I know a trick, all right?

35:27.380 --> 35:29.749
Point down at his zipper and say,
"Gross, your cock's hanging out."

35:29.849 --> 35:31.884
And then when they look down... Boom!

35:31.984 --> 35:33.983
You punch them in the face.

35:35.153 --> 35:37.340
My dad taught me that.

35:38.522 --> 35:41.025
All right, ladies. From the top.

37:27.257 --> 37:30.093
Goddamn, I have the worst headache.

37:30.193 --> 37:31.673
Were we asleep?

37:35.330 --> 37:37.411
Amps are buggered.

37:39.432 --> 37:42.535
Guys... guys, do I look different?

37:42.635 --> 37:45.484
More, like... more powerful?

37:53.010 --> 37:54.511
You could be weaker than before.

37:54.611 --> 37:58.302
Something fucked up happened, man.
My head is throbbing.

38:00.647 --> 38:04.597
Something went wrong. It didn't work.

38:05.384 --> 38:08.067
What are you talking about, dude?

38:12.389 --> 38:17.065
Wouldn't it be crazy if... if the music
had something to do with demons?

38:17.165 --> 38:18.975
Demons?

38:20.497 --> 38:22.377
Demons?

38:23.232 --> 38:25.254
Demons?

38:41.479 --> 38:43.248
Fuck!

38:43.848 --> 38:47.584
- What do you want, asshole?
- Can you hear the trumpets, Brodie?

38:47.684 --> 38:51.554
They're getting louder.
The Blind One is coming.

38:51.704 --> 38:54.562
He's going to suck out your intestines
for a thousand years

38:54.662 --> 38:57.704
and use your ribs as toothpicks.

39:00.253 --> 39:02.001
Okay.

39:06.848 --> 39:11.390
Did I mention... he's going to roast
your nuts over an open fire?

39:11.490 --> 39:13.916
While they're still attached, of course.

39:14.016 --> 39:17.737
- No, Terry. You didn't mention that.
- Well, he is.

39:47.848 --> 39:50.925
Mr. Capenhurst, are you okay?

40:08.197 --> 40:10.245
Oh, my God.

40:15.069 --> 40:17.784
Oh, my God.

40:23.975 --> 40:27.546
There was just blood everywhere,
from every hole.

40:27.746 --> 40:30.381
- It was crazy.
- Weird.

40:30.481 --> 40:32.282
Yeah, it was mental, man.

40:32.382 --> 40:36.757
Medina, too. Just...
just totally ignored me.

40:36.952 --> 40:39.120
Did she say why?

40:39.420 --> 40:41.088
No.

40:41.188 --> 40:44.887
Feels like everybody in my neighborhood
has gone insane.

40:45.391 --> 40:48.094
This town has always been fuckin' crazy.

40:48.194 --> 40:51.899
Pouring fuckin' fluoride
in the water or something.

40:52.331 --> 40:54.445
What the fuck is that noise?

40:56.301 --> 40:58.148
Dad?

40:59.937 --> 41:02.051
For fuck's sake.

41:04.706 --> 41:06.521
Dad?

41:07.509 --> 41:09.323
Dad?

41:11.646 --> 41:14.081
Dad, what the fuck are you doing?

41:14.181 --> 41:17.383
Dad? What are you doing?

41:17.483 --> 41:20.652
- What's wrong with him, is he drunk?
- I don't think so.

41:20.752 --> 41:22.353
Dad, talk to me.

41:22.453 --> 41:25.696
Look, I want to take this T-shirt
off your face. Yeah?

41:25.796 --> 41:28.978
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's okay.

41:29.958 --> 41:31.706
Fuck!

41:33.729 --> 41:35.810
What the fuck is he doing?

41:37.699 --> 41:41.235
- Holy fuck!
- I can see you.

41:41.335 --> 41:43.160
Fuck!

42:25.539 --> 42:27.375
Brutal.

42:27.775 --> 42:30.124
Should we... check his pulse.

42:30.224 --> 42:32.930
He has a fucking engine for a head.

42:33.380 --> 42:36.316
I don't think he's gonna be
walking this one off, man.

42:36.416 --> 42:38.264
Shit.

42:39.317 --> 42:42.908
Your Dad, I'm... Fuck. I'm really sorry.

42:45.221 --> 42:47.103
Fuck!

42:54.862 --> 42:58.267
You know, it's weird but...

42:58.967 --> 43:02.116
I think he would've wanted
to go out like this.

43:03.169 --> 43:08.040
His eyes ripped out, face grinded off,
and then head mounted under a car engine?

43:08.140 --> 43:09.988
Totally.

43:12.442 --> 43:14.687
For whom the bell tolls, old man.

43:16.611 --> 43:19.314
Oh, fuck.

43:19.414 --> 43:21.216
Fuck!

43:21.616 --> 43:25.271
Dude, dude, I am so sorry. Fuck, man.

43:25.371 --> 43:27.683
This is all my fault. Okay. Fuck.

43:27.783 --> 43:32.058
I translated those pages, and they were
all to do with summoning demons, okay?

43:32.158 --> 43:36.359
And now people are turning crazy.
Like, possessed crazy.

43:36.459 --> 43:39.331
You knew that was some black magic shit
and you didn't fuckin' tell me?

43:39.431 --> 43:43.040
- I didn't want you to think I was crazy.
- It's a bit fuckin' late now, isn't it?

43:45.568 --> 43:48.004
This is fucking twisted, man.

43:48.104 --> 43:50.585
Fuckin' demons?

43:52.306 --> 43:56.543
Abigail. Fuckin' Abigail. You know, the chick
from the record store, the psychic chick.

43:56.643 --> 43:59.958
She knows all about this stuff.
We should go see her.

44:22.830 --> 44:25.629
The lights are on.
They could still be here.

44:36.541 --> 44:38.510
Well, I'm out of ideas.

44:38.610 --> 44:40.490
Jesus!

44:44.681 --> 44:46.835
These things suck.

44:48.784 --> 44:51.449
What are you... what are you doing?

44:52.753 --> 44:56.655
Who brings a dice purse
to a demon apocalypse anyway?

45:07.532 --> 45:10.847
- How do we stop these things?
- Shit.

45:17.505 --> 45:19.040
- Medina!
- What's up?

45:19.140 --> 45:21.689
- Sweet axe skills.
- Thanks.

45:21.789 --> 45:24.878
I wanted to come up with one-liner like,
"you were axing for this," or something.

45:24.978 --> 45:27.447
- That would be really cool, right?
- That was pretty cool as is.

45:27.547 --> 45:29.595
I mean, the axe, and the...

45:30.815 --> 45:32.964
- Yeah.
- Fuckin' awesome.

45:59.104 --> 46:01.300
Abigail, we need to get you
to a hospital, okay?

46:01.400 --> 46:03.674
It's too late.

46:03.974 --> 46:06.357
It has possessed their bodies.

46:09.745 --> 46:11.513
Is that Satan?

46:11.613 --> 46:15.682
That is Aeloth, king of the demons.

46:15.782 --> 46:19.051
Aeloth? Sounds like a badass.

46:19.151 --> 46:24.055
- These words were in music pages.
- The Black Hymn. You have it.

46:24.555 --> 46:27.610
Have it? We fuckin' played it.

46:34.227 --> 46:38.612
Well, then you have fucked us all.

46:45.170 --> 46:47.877
The possessed bodies...

46:49.052 --> 46:52.671
they kill all in their path...

46:52.771 --> 46:56.180
in preparation for Aeloth's ascension...

46:56.280 --> 46:58.850
on the next blood moon.

47:02.150 --> 47:05.596
- On the devil's hour.
- Oh, shit.

47:05.696 --> 47:08.155
The moon is red tonight.

47:08.255 --> 47:11.770
- When is the Devil's hour?
- Three a.m.

47:13.591 --> 47:15.193
Wait.

47:15.293 --> 47:18.013
Three a.m. Pacific or Eastern time?

47:18.429 --> 47:21.331
Do demons recognize daylight savings?

47:21.799 --> 47:27.838
When Aeloth returns His soul will fuse
with that of a darkest human host.

47:28.238 --> 47:30.118
How can we stop him?

47:30.940 --> 47:33.762
- Do you still have the Black Hymn?
- Yeah, it's back at my Uncle's.

47:33.862 --> 47:35.789
Well, then we can...

47:36.778 --> 47:38.759
Oh, shit!

47:57.830 --> 47:59.197
Have you guys seen Brodie tonight?

47:59.297 --> 48:01.999
Everyone I've seen is either
dead or psycho-ed.

48:02.099 --> 48:06.068
No sign. Hey, my dad said we should
head to the school in an emergency.

48:06.168 --> 48:08.435
It's... Greypoint's
civil defense centre.

48:08.535 --> 48:14.231
He's a warden. I mean,
was until he... got possessed and...

48:14.331 --> 48:17.211
- ate Mom's skin off.
- Dude, are you still going on about that?

48:17.311 --> 48:19.446
It was hours ago, get the fuck over it.

48:19.546 --> 48:21.897
Let's head to the school.
We're not gonna survive out here.

48:21.997 --> 48:24.078
Oh, wait a sec.

48:32.555 --> 48:34.591
Oh, God.

48:34.691 --> 48:37.405
Let's hope the demons can't read.

48:40.160 --> 48:42.074
You ready?

48:43.029 --> 48:45.094
Let's go.

49:10.987 --> 49:14.732
We need you to destroy
the Vocavitque Rex daemonia.

49:14.832 --> 49:17.926
Destroy it? We came here to get it.

49:18.126 --> 49:23.648
Those who performed the Black Hymn may try
to reverse it before Aeloth's ascension.

49:23.748 --> 49:26.341
- Can't you destroy it?
- No!

49:26.441 --> 49:31.044
Only those who still have
a soul can touch the pages.

49:31.144 --> 49:33.081
I do not.

49:34.537 --> 49:36.720
I have one condition.

49:37.207 --> 49:40.704
I want to become Aeloth's vessel.
It has to be me.

49:40.804 --> 49:46.414
His soul will bind
with the blackest human soul nearby.

49:46.514 --> 49:50.284
A soul that will not resist his power.

49:53.251 --> 49:56.374
You... No! Please! No!

49:58.923 --> 50:01.830
Now who doesn't have a gag reflex?

50:10.983 --> 50:14.297
I pledge allegiance to Aeloth the Blind.

50:14.737 --> 50:17.402
Kill anyone who gets in your way.

50:17.502 --> 50:22.186
You will be rewarded with more power
than you can imagine.

50:24.877 --> 50:27.732
Find Brodie. He is the key.

50:33.952 --> 50:37.534
Before she died Abigail
was trying to tell us something.

50:41.556 --> 50:43.438
Maybe...

50:45.660 --> 50:49.165
Okay. We're gonna back to my place,
I'm gonna get my guitar and the pages.

50:49.265 --> 50:52.133
I'm gonna try and play this song
backwards, Rob Halford style, man.

50:52.233 --> 50:54.201
I mean, it makes sense, right?
Reverse all this shit?

50:54.301 --> 50:57.470
Fuck that. This town is shit.

50:57.570 --> 51:01.072
We're going up to the lookout rolling
a three-skinner, cranking some Slayer

51:01.172 --> 51:04.523
and watching this town
burn to the fuckin' ground!

51:05.809 --> 51:08.846
Dude, what about Medina, Giles and Dion?
They could all still be alive.

51:08.946 --> 51:11.293
Those guys are dicks.

51:13.081 --> 51:15.751
Medina is never gonna
put out for you, man.

51:15.851 --> 51:18.386
You're never gonna get
to second base with that girl.

51:18.486 --> 51:20.188
What?

51:20.588 --> 51:22.423
You know, anal.

51:22.523 --> 51:26.060
Okay, firstly, I don't wanna know
what you think forth base is, all right?

51:26.160 --> 51:28.474
But I'm going for the music pages.

51:32.829 --> 51:35.144
Dude, fucking stop.

51:37.032 --> 51:38.637
Don't you give a shit
about anyone but yourself?

51:38.737 --> 51:41.730
No, I don't. Fuck them.

51:50.160 --> 51:53.370
Dude, I do care about the Holden.

51:57.216 --> 51:59.385
Hey, Cocktopus! You win.

51:59.485 --> 52:02.359
I'll take you to do the thing
with the music, or whatever.

52:03.455 --> 52:05.368
Dude!

52:09.258 --> 52:11.607
Come on. Get in.

52:15.730 --> 52:17.583
Come on.

52:33.113 --> 52:36.250
Okay. So all the shit
is in my room, all right.

52:36.350 --> 52:38.885
But just watch out for my Aunt and Uncle,
because they hate you.

52:38.985 --> 52:42.521
And also... they might be demons.

52:43.122 --> 52:45.336
- Right.
- Okay.

52:52.762 --> 52:54.164
Oh, shit.

52:54.264 --> 52:56.099
But they are into
all that God shit, right?

52:56.199 --> 52:58.267
They'll be sweet,
they'll just pray themselves to safety.

52:58.367 --> 53:00.269
No, no.

53:00.369 --> 53:03.272
No, they were at home
when we played the song.

53:03.372 --> 53:07.279
Look, they definitely
would've heard it, okay?

53:19.186 --> 53:22.218
Looks all clear. I'll get the music.

53:25.591 --> 53:29.411
You've been a bad boy, Brodie.

53:30.111 --> 53:33.945
I can taste you from here.

53:35.401 --> 53:37.148
Zakk!

53:39.770 --> 53:41.510
Fuck!

54:00.285 --> 54:03.868
Shit. We need to arm up.

54:07.824 --> 54:11.433
- Does your uncle have a gun?
- I doubt it, man. Fuck!

54:11.533 --> 54:14.293
Fuck. Fuck, yes!

54:14.593 --> 54:17.870
I bet there are some crosses in here.
Or some bibles we could bash them with.

54:19.230 --> 54:21.066
What the hell?

54:21.166 --> 54:23.948
I think they're...
they're rosary beads? Yeah.

54:26.103 --> 54:29.118
What part of church do they crank
this bad boy, Brodie?

54:31.808 --> 54:34.243
- Hey, Brodie?
- What?

54:34.343 --> 54:36.390
Oh, fuck.

54:37.712 --> 54:39.827
Why would you do that?

55:22.253 --> 55:24.329
It's not working.

55:26.089 --> 55:27.856
These are a bit shit.

55:27.956 --> 55:29.903
- Hold them off.
- What?

55:53.460 --> 55:54.945
Yes.

55:58.346 --> 56:00.147
Brodie!

56:00.247 --> 56:01.894
No!

56:27.366 --> 56:29.981
No! No!

56:30.768 --> 56:33.071
No! No! No!

56:34.015 --> 56:35.586
No!

56:36.873 --> 56:40.388
I'm going to eat your soul.

56:58.891 --> 57:01.890
Fucking die!

57:12.100 --> 57:13.368
No!

57:13.468 --> 57:16.988
No! Stop! Please. No!

58:04.879 --> 58:06.627
No.

58:08.515 --> 58:10.063
No.

58:49.120 --> 58:52.188
What... the fuck?

59:04.133 --> 59:07.971
- Pretty sure he wasn't possessed.
- What? Oh, no. Of course he was.

59:08.071 --> 59:12.822
Because when he came in
he said something about Satan.

59:13.975 --> 59:16.191
You didn't hear him say that?

59:30.389 --> 59:32.203
Fuck!

59:34.624 --> 59:37.661
Hey, the pages are blowing away.
You have to help me...

59:37.761 --> 59:40.096
Oh, sick, man.

59:40.596 --> 59:43.831
- What? They were like that when I found them.
- Come on. We have to get the music.

59:43.931 --> 59:47.768
All right, look I'm going to help you
do this, but only because you suck at it.

59:47.868 --> 59:52.250
Also it's kind of fun stabbing shit.
But we need to get better weapons. Yeah?

01:00:03.579 --> 01:00:06.661
- Brutal.
- Brutal as fuck.

01:00:49.318 --> 01:00:52.027
You're pretty good
at whacking guys off, bro.

01:01:11.971 --> 01:01:14.059
Did you see that?

01:01:14.741 --> 01:01:18.277
- I'm gonna go check it out.
- Brodie, you've got the page, let's go.

01:01:18.677 --> 01:01:20.490
Brodie!

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:27.563
Shit!

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:29.385
Medina.

01:01:29.485 --> 01:01:31.242
Brodie.

01:01:32.653 --> 01:01:35.689
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:01:35.789 --> 01:01:38.822
We're just holed up in... inside.

01:01:39.292 --> 01:01:40.560
We?

01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:43.704
When Medina was killing those demons...

01:01:43.804 --> 01:01:45.597
I got a bit of a half-chub.

01:01:45.697 --> 01:01:48.099
Look, let's get back
to the matter at hand here.

01:01:48.199 --> 01:01:50.935
Seeing as how you're in an underground
dwarven citadel,

01:01:51.035 --> 01:01:53.816
it looks as if it has
nested hinges, which...

01:01:53.916 --> 01:01:55.673
Oh... Brodie!

01:01:55.973 --> 01:01:58.975
- Told you they'd be okay.
- No, you didn't.

01:01:59.075 --> 01:02:02.277
You said they were probably dead already.
You wanted dibs on his guitar.

01:02:02.951 --> 01:02:06.815
- I found these guys outside your house.
- You were looking for us?

01:02:06.915 --> 01:02:10.218
Of course. You got our note, right?

01:02:10.318 --> 01:02:13.254
No. I didn't see any note.

01:02:36.273 --> 01:02:40.189
Who would have thought that Mr. Proctor's
rock collection would come in handy?

01:02:42.010 --> 01:02:44.913
- Oh, gosh. Your hand.
- Oh... it's okay.

01:02:45.113 --> 01:02:46.527
No.

01:02:52.251 --> 01:02:54.679
That's Zakk's jacket.

01:02:55.754 --> 01:02:58.136
When did you get that?

01:03:00.891 --> 01:03:02.661
He...

01:03:03.661 --> 01:03:05.994
He lent it to me.

01:03:06.664 --> 01:03:10.735
He stopped by the other night
to tell me that...

01:03:12.035 --> 01:03:13.837
you know.

01:03:14.137 --> 01:03:16.720
You weren't interested.

01:03:18.372 --> 01:03:20.075
What?

01:03:20.375 --> 01:03:24.312
The note that I gave Zakk to give to you
to meet me at the park at 9:00.

01:03:24.712 --> 01:03:27.894
No. I didn't get that note either.

01:03:33.653 --> 01:03:35.500
So...

01:03:37.521 --> 01:03:40.087
did you guys hook up?

01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:48.662
- Motherfucker!
- Brodie, just leave it.

01:03:49.362 --> 01:03:51.745
Fuckin' wanker. You knew I liked her.

01:03:51.845 --> 01:03:54.801
Calm the fuck down, all right?

01:03:54.901 --> 01:03:56.669
I'm not even into her; I was just bored.

01:03:56.769 --> 01:03:59.038
Well. That's supposed
to make it fuckin' better?

01:03:59.138 --> 01:04:01.597
What happened to Brotherhood of Steel?

01:04:01.697 --> 01:04:04.248
Everyone was fuckin' right about you.
You're a piece of shit.

01:04:04.348 --> 01:04:09.387
Fuck you! You let this happen
by being such an insecure pussy.

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:16.499
Yeah, that's right walk away.
Grow some fucking balls, man.

01:04:21.289 --> 01:04:23.170
Motherfucker!

01:04:29.828 --> 01:04:31.997
You motherfucker. You knew I liked her.

01:04:32.635 --> 01:04:35.162
Save it for the demons, you two.

01:04:35.834 --> 01:04:37.633
All right.

01:04:37.733 --> 01:04:39.615
All right.

01:04:48.875 --> 01:04:51.278
Fuck you!

01:04:51.578 --> 01:04:54.117
I never even liked you.

01:05:00.451 --> 01:05:04.547
Good luck fighting evil without me.
You're all gonna fuckin' die.

01:05:09.325 --> 01:05:11.757
Death to false metal!

01:05:15.464 --> 01:05:17.000
I expected this.

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:20.370
He's Chaotic Neutral
and you're Lawful Good.

01:05:20.770 --> 01:05:24.152
Your alignments
are just totally mismatched.

01:05:35.215 --> 01:05:38.451
How are we gonna play it backwards?
It was hard enough playing it forwards.

01:05:38.551 --> 01:05:40.586
Will take a few goes.

01:05:40.686 --> 01:05:43.217
- Well, time isn't exactly on our side.
- And another problem.

01:05:43.317 --> 01:05:46.623
When we first played the song, everyone in
the neighborhood got possessed first, right?

01:05:46.723 --> 01:05:49.425
- So?
- Well, they were all within earshot.

01:05:49.525 --> 01:05:51.260
But our amps blew up.

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:53.529
Right. Okay, so we need
some serious decibels.

01:05:53.629 --> 01:05:55.945
- Well, does the school have any?
- Are you kidding?

01:05:56.045 --> 01:06:00.501
Our whole music class had to share
the same recorder. I can still taste it.

01:06:00.601 --> 01:06:02.153
I know a place that has amps.

01:06:02.253 --> 01:06:05.505
Big ones. Not sure if they still work,
but it's our only chance.

01:06:05.605 --> 01:06:10.041
Out there? It's gonna be crazy.
And we don't have a car without Zakk.

01:06:10.141 --> 01:06:14.010
Zakk can eat my ass. We don't need him.
We can do it on our own.

01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:16.224
Fuck, yeah.

01:06:19.332 --> 01:06:21.182
Fuck, yeah.

01:06:21.282 --> 01:06:23.330
Let's tear shit up.

01:06:31.652 --> 01:06:33.460
Stay low.

01:06:37.361 --> 01:06:39.213
Come on.

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:50.459
- Just chill, all right. We're not demons.
- Drop the weapons. Now.

01:06:53.408 --> 01:06:57.057
Damn! I can't tell if I have
a fear boner or a boner boner.

01:06:58.846 --> 01:07:01.548
- I didn't even say anything. Hit him.
- Just let us go, okay.

01:07:01.648 --> 01:07:05.118
You don't know what you're doing.
The town is overrun with fucking demons.

01:07:05.218 --> 01:07:08.121
We know exactly what we are doing.

01:07:08.221 --> 01:07:10.523
Give me the Vogue-catty
queff-wrecks-demony.

01:07:10.623 --> 01:07:13.356
It's actually pronounced
Vocavitque Rex daemonia.

01:07:13.456 --> 01:07:15.861
That tongue wasn't meant for Latin.

01:07:17.061 --> 01:07:20.164
- Come on.
- The Black Hymn, where is it?

01:07:20.264 --> 01:07:22.779
I don't know what you talking about. No.

01:07:26.635 --> 01:07:27.694
Well?

01:07:27.794 --> 01:07:31.671
Don't tell this Manson family
cumbucket anything, Brodie.

01:07:31.771 --> 01:07:33.687
Okay, okay.

01:07:36.742 --> 01:07:38.085
It's here.

01:07:41.041 --> 01:07:42.293
No!

01:07:48.317 --> 01:07:52.018
Tie them up, take them in the bedroom.
They can be a live offering for Aeloth.

01:07:52.118 --> 01:07:54.924
No. No, please, let us go.

01:07:55.024 --> 01:07:58.593
You had your chance.
You awakened Aeloth,

01:07:58.693 --> 01:08:02.963
pleaded with him to take away
your weakness and vanquish your enemies.

01:08:03.063 --> 01:08:09.328
He would've given you power, fame,
fortune, and any woman you want.

01:08:10.269 --> 01:08:11.637
But you blew it.

01:08:11.737 --> 01:08:14.573
Is that true Brodie?
You did all of this for power?

01:08:15.173 --> 01:08:16.875
- I didn't want this.
- Get them out.

01:08:17.975 --> 01:08:19.490
Okay. Okay, okay.

01:08:30.353 --> 01:08:33.569
Do you think if we soil our pants,
they'll let us go?

01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:36.964
I guess we'll find out soon.

01:08:42.029 --> 01:08:44.898
In sanguine. Intra in sanguinem.

01:08:44.997 --> 01:08:49.268
De caelo laceri. Lacerato horrorem.

01:08:49.368 --> 01:08:54.071
Proin cursus meum.
Regnabunt autem in sanguine...

01:08:54.604 --> 01:08:59.158
Hey, I never meant for this to happen,
okay? I just want to let you know that.

01:09:00.608 --> 01:09:02.923
I was desperate.

01:09:03.243 --> 01:09:06.725
I just... I felt so fuckin' powerless.

01:09:12.484 --> 01:09:15.256
You are not powerless, Brodie.

01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:18.483
You can till stop this.

01:09:19.124 --> 01:09:20.651
I know you can.

01:09:22.859 --> 01:09:24.524
What was that, guys?

01:09:27.895 --> 01:09:29.229
Shit.

01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:31.011
There's something in there.

01:09:46.243 --> 01:09:51.761
Which one of you cunts
wants to be skull-fucked first?

01:09:58.753 --> 01:10:02.769
No, no. Not me.
I need my skull for exams.

01:10:04.625 --> 01:10:08.561
Sacrifice is a noble act, you know.

01:10:09.129 --> 01:10:11.368
Fucking old bastard.

01:10:12.698 --> 01:10:14.180
Oh, my God.

01:10:30.578 --> 01:10:32.592
Did you miss me?

01:10:45.790 --> 01:10:47.947
I thought you were off to the lookout
to watch the town burn.

01:10:48.047 --> 01:10:50.395
Realized I couldn't leave
my mate in the shit.

01:10:50.495 --> 01:10:53.077
Not with all these demons to mega-kill.

01:10:56.666 --> 01:10:58.956
Metalheads stick together, right?

01:11:03.657 --> 01:11:06.509
Wait. You decided
that you wanted to help us,

01:11:06.609 --> 01:11:08.800
and then you went and applied makeup?

01:11:09.209 --> 01:11:11.411
Well, how long did it take?
What ten, fifteen minutes?

01:11:11.511 --> 01:11:14.713
It's not makeup, it's fucking
corpse paint. For going into battle?

01:11:14.813 --> 01:11:19.030
Okay. Well, you look adorable.
It really brings out your eyes.

01:11:21.418 --> 01:11:23.587
- What's the plan?
- Okay. I get my guitar.

01:11:23.687 --> 01:11:27.089
- You guys get me to the amps. Cover me.
- But she ripped up the pages.

01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:30.225
Do you really think you can
play it from memory?

01:11:30.325 --> 01:11:32.539
I have to try.

01:11:34.193 --> 01:11:38.109
One more thing...
can you quickly pull me off?

01:11:43.708 --> 01:11:45.447
Right.

01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:50.917
De caelo laceri. Lacerato horrorem.

01:11:57.709 --> 01:12:00.556
Metal up your ass, motherfucker!

01:12:32.969 --> 01:12:34.416
No!

01:12:40.774 --> 01:12:43.466
- Where's Dion?
- He was behind us. He must've got lost.

01:12:43.566 --> 01:12:45.305
There's only a few fucking rooms.

01:12:46.212 --> 01:12:47.925
Dion!

01:13:16.103 --> 01:13:17.916
Fuck!

01:13:25.575 --> 01:13:26.890
Giles!

01:14:20.558 --> 01:14:23.060
- Hurry, Brodie.
- I'm trying.

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:25.641
Kill them all!

01:15:11.538 --> 01:15:13.187
It's three a.m.

01:15:33.924 --> 01:15:37.941
Aeloth! Come into me!

01:15:39.729 --> 01:15:42.572
Fill me with your power!

01:16:17.663 --> 01:16:19.765
So much power!

01:16:19.865 --> 01:16:21.813
This is fucking brutal.

01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:28.785
What?

01:16:33.542 --> 01:16:35.409
Fuck.

01:16:36.009 --> 01:16:39.003
You know, I'm not even sure
I'm in the right tuning.

01:16:55.458 --> 01:16:58.928
So, dude, I'm thinking
about doing a 'Burzum'.

01:16:59.028 --> 01:17:02.211
Starting my own solo project.

01:17:08.501 --> 01:17:12.681
Medina! Run! Run!

01:17:15.039 --> 01:17:18.376
I mean, you and the rest of the band
are just dead weight.

01:17:18.676 --> 01:17:22.616
Dude, zip up your fly.
I can see your dong.

01:17:22.716 --> 01:17:24.326
What?

01:17:29.584 --> 01:17:32.319
You don't get it, do you?
You can't stop me.

01:17:32.419 --> 01:17:37.002
I'm gonna destroy this world of shit,
one maggot at a time.

01:17:42.259 --> 01:17:44.007
Medina!

01:17:56.405 --> 01:17:58.341
Look at it this way...

01:17:58.441 --> 01:18:01.410
you're about to lose five kgs
without a crash diet.

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:03.456
Fuck it.

01:18:11.847 --> 01:18:14.646
No, no, no, no. That's not gonna work.

01:18:15.318 --> 01:18:18.707
You have to play the black hymn,
fuckin' idiot.

01:18:58.288 --> 01:18:59.703
Zakk.

01:19:01.624 --> 01:19:03.560
Thanks, man.

01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:06.124
The metal brought me back.

01:19:12.666 --> 01:19:15.181
I'm trying to hold him off.

01:19:15.701 --> 01:19:19.127
- He's gonna destroy everything.
- Dude, fight it.

01:19:19.227 --> 01:19:23.086
You gotta be strong. I mean,
you're the strong one, remember?

01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:28.179
I can't. He's too powerful.

01:19:29.176 --> 01:19:31.225
Finish me.

01:19:31.325 --> 01:19:35.120
Quickly. Before Aeloth takes over again.

01:19:36.714 --> 01:19:38.895
Man, I can't, I can't.

01:19:41.984 --> 01:19:45.233
You have to do it. There's no other way.
Send him back to hell.

01:19:48.888 --> 01:19:50.929
Do it!

01:20:26.555 --> 01:20:28.867
Brotherhood of steel, dude.

01:20:30.024 --> 01:20:32.312
Brotherhood of steel, forever.

01:21:01.018 --> 01:21:03.078
I don't know, I just...

01:21:04.022 --> 01:21:06.324
I can't stand mic cupping.

01:21:06.424 --> 01:21:11.234
- Cannibal Corpse do it.
- No. Barnes used to do it. Fisher...

01:21:11.829 --> 01:21:13.564
it's straight from the guts.

01:21:13.664 --> 01:21:17.333
Shit. Did I just get schooled?

01:21:17.433 --> 01:21:20.314
I'm a very fast learner.

01:21:21.267 --> 01:21:22.981
How's the tat?

01:21:23.836 --> 01:21:25.850
It's all healed up.

01:21:29.506 --> 01:21:31.535
I'll see you later.

01:21:58.232 --> 01:22:02.335
You really thought this was over?
Time to die, Brodie!

01:22:09.641 --> 01:22:12.157
- No, just kidding, dude.
- Zakk?

01:25:18.594 --> 01:25:21.598
So what's like... being dead?

01:25:21.698 --> 01:25:23.867
<i>Hell is awesome!</i>

01:25:23.967 --> 01:25:25.735
<i>Like, met some music legends:</i>

01:25:25.835 --> 01:25:28.237
<i>Dio, Kurt Cobain, Dimebag,</i>

01:25:28.337 --> 01:25:31.372
<i>Jon Bonham, Paul McCartney.</i>

01:25:31.638 --> 01:25:36.143
<i>Yeah, the true, true Mayhem
reunited, too. So cold, dude.</i>

01:25:36.443 --> 01:25:38.943
Fucking brutal as.

01:25:39.043 --> 01:25:40.313
<i>Anyway, the band.</i>

01:25:40.513 --> 01:25:42.715
<i>You got to keep playing, dude.</i>

01:25:43.383 --> 01:25:47.152
But everyone is dead. We can't keep
calling ourselves DEATHGASM.

01:25:47.252 --> 01:25:48.634
Doesn't feel right.

01:25:48.734 --> 01:25:53.124
<i>All right then. Well, change it.
How about... Bandsaw Circumcision?</i>

01:25:53.224 --> 01:25:56.660
- Intesticide?
- <i>What about, like, Bestiality Bliss?</i>

01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:59.129
Yeah, how about Birth Canal Boat Riders?

01:25:59.229 --> 01:26:01.397
<i>What about The God Buggerers?</i>

01:26:01.497 --> 01:26:05.279
- How about David Bain's Scrotum.
- <i>Anal Bulimia?</i>

01:26:06.305 --> 01:26:12.731
