00:31.848 --> 00:35.386
<i>God saw that the fight was good...</i>

00:35.452 --> 00:40.731
and he separated the light
from the darkness.

00:40.790 --> 00:43.862
Genesis 1 :4

02:49.519 --> 02:51.021
Father Vidal!

02:58.061 --> 02:59.699
Let's go, Rayo.

03:11.374 --> 03:12.876
12.57 seconds.

05:12.161 --> 05:13.663
Are the Manzurs there?

05:19.669 --> 05:20.807
They are.

05:22.538 --> 05:24.449
- Hi.
- How are you?

05:25.475 --> 05:26.977
Come, Rayo.

05:29.879 --> 05:32.359
Two. One.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.320
He's off.

05:48.331 --> 05:50.777
He won!

05:50.833 --> 05:52.437
He won.

05:53.803 --> 05:55.305
He won.

05:58.474 --> 05:59.612
He won.

06:13.389 --> 06:17.997
With the last race we totaled
470,000 pesos. Not bad.

06:18.061 --> 06:20.667
That money is a blessing.

06:20.730 --> 06:24.906
- I would split it.
- What do you need money for?

06:24.968 --> 06:27.244
For expenses.

06:27.303 --> 06:30.978
We need more dogs.
One greyhound is not enough.

06:31.040 --> 06:34.351
I'd have an army of dogs,
all from the same mother.

06:34.410 --> 06:36.754
I think we're doing very well
with Rayo.

06:37.480 --> 06:42.953
The last champion from Santiago
won by 12.37 in the ZOO-yard race.

06:43.019 --> 06:45.021
We're very close.

06:45.088 --> 06:49.468
Rayo ran it in 12.57 seconds.
A difference of 0.20 seconds.

06:49.525 --> 06:51.937
Really? That's great.

06:51.995 --> 06:55.807
Will the dogs be as fast
as those black Jamaican ones?

06:56.933 --> 06:58.606
Rayo will be the champion.

06:59.235 --> 07:02.182
What? The race is in Santiago.

07:02.238 --> 07:04.081
But I can go with Rayo.

07:04.140 --> 07:07.314
How could you go?
Who would stay with us?

07:07.377 --> 07:10.256
You could find a substitute.

07:10.313 --> 07:12.156
Impossible.

07:12.815 --> 07:17.161
But we simply must find a way
to take that dog to Santiago.

07:17.220 --> 07:20.064
Let's win the regionals
and then we'll see.

08:12.241 --> 08:15.154
Perhaps some of you
have met him already.

08:15.211 --> 08:18.556
But let me introduce
Father Matias Lozcano.

08:18.614 --> 08:21.493
From now on,
he will join you in your home...

08:21.551 --> 08:24.122
in this community of yours.

08:24.620 --> 08:25.860
Father Matias.

08:26.589 --> 08:30.731
Let me introduce Father Vidal,
Father Ortega...

08:31.194 --> 08:35.438
Father Silva and Father Ramirez.

08:35.498 --> 08:37.171
I’m Sister Monica.

08:37.232 --> 08:40.304
We're very happy to have you here.

08:40.369 --> 08:41.780
Welcome.

08:42.438 --> 08:45.180
This house is very important
to the church.

08:45.241 --> 08:48.688
A shelter, a house of prayer.

08:48.744 --> 08:50.746
Is anybody else coming, Father?

08:51.547 --> 08:53.925
No, not that I’m aware of.

08:54.584 --> 08:58.293
Father Matias,
you will sleep on the first floor.

08:58.354 --> 09:01.198
You're very lucky.
You'll have a room to yourself.

09:01.257 --> 09:03.203
It's a little room next to the chapel...

09:03.259 --> 09:07.139
that the Fathers and I have been
sprucing up for some time.

09:07.196 --> 09:09.198
It's very nice.

09:10.199 --> 09:12.440
Father, do you like animals?

09:15.638 --> 09:16.878
Yes.

09:18.608 --> 09:21.646
I have a cat
they wouldn't let me bring.

09:21.711 --> 09:26.683
Excuse me, were you in a parish
in San Antonio in the '80s?

09:26.749 --> 09:30.287
No. Father Matias is from Chillan.

09:32.088 --> 09:33.761
He's a “Chillanejo.”

09:33.823 --> 09:38.272
ls the correct term “Chillanejo”
or “Chillanense”?

09:38.327 --> 09:40.000
However you like.

09:41.297 --> 09:45.541
If you'd given us notice,
we could've put some meat on the grill...

09:45.601 --> 09:47.945
to celebrate the Father's arrival.

09:48.971 --> 09:51.713
Some pork sausages from Chillan.

09:51.774 --> 09:52.946
From Chillan.

09:54.810 --> 09:57.484
Did you bring any sausages, Father?

10:03.186 --> 10:07.794
We wake up in the morning and pray.
Then we have breakfast.

10:07.857 --> 10:12.237
Then there's some free time
for personal matters.

10:12.295 --> 10:14.673
We hold mass at noon.

10:14.730 --> 10:18.200
The fathers take turns officiating,
the same with confession.

10:18.267 --> 10:21.646
If you are in need of confession,
just let me know.

10:21.704 --> 10:25.242
L will speak with the fathers
and one of them will help you.

10:25.308 --> 10:29.051
We have lunch at 1:00.
After that, we sing.

10:29.111 --> 10:32.115
Then we have some free time,
and at 8:30, we have dinner.

10:32.181 --> 10:35.651
We say the rosary at 8:00
and have dinner at 8:30.

10:36.586 --> 10:39.624
You cannot go into town...

10:39.689 --> 10:45.640
unless ifs between 6:30 and 8:30 am.
or 7:00 and 9:00 p.m.

10:45.695 --> 10:49.666
If you Want to go out during those hours,
you can, but only alone.

10:49.732 --> 10:52.679
You cant be on the streets together.

10:52.735 --> 10:58.151
It's absolutely forbidden to communicate
with any person outside of this house.

10:59.141 --> 11:02.645
Also forbidden is any activity
involving self-flagellation...

11:02.712 --> 11:05.318
or self-pleasuring.

11:05.381 --> 11:08.225
You are not allowed
to handle money or cell phones.

11:08.284 --> 11:13.666
Excuse me, Sister, but I don't know
why I should have to be...

11:13.723 --> 11:17.637
subjected to the same rules
as those men.

11:17.693 --> 11:19.730
Maybe you don't know why I’m here.

11:19.795 --> 11:23.299
I didn't commit any crime, any sin.

11:23.366 --> 11:25.039
I’m not a queer.

11:27.270 --> 11:30.217
I had a bit of trouble...

11:30.973 --> 11:33.214
- Porcelain heart...
- but it was resolved.

11:33.276 --> 11:36.485
The one who loves you
is called Sandokan.

11:37.980 --> 11:41.587
A rose fell from the sky.
The wind pulled its petals.

11:41.651 --> 11:45.064
And each petal said,
“My name is Sandokan.”

11:45.121 --> 11:49.001
Chinese orange, French lemon.

11:49.058 --> 11:52.096
Give me a kiss because I’m thirsty.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.473
Sister.

12:00.236 --> 12:02.807
Give him something to eat.

12:02.872 --> 12:04.874
No, I think we should give him money.

12:04.940 --> 12:07.113
- Yes, that would be better.
- Wouldn't it?

12:09.812 --> 12:12.816
I saw you arrive in a black oar.

12:16.619 --> 12:18.963
Why don't you come out
and talk with me?

12:22.258 --> 12:25.262
Why don't you come talk with me?

12:33.803 --> 12:37.808
Why don't you come talk with me,
Father Matias Lozcano?

12:41.377 --> 12:44.950
When the priests came to get us-

12:45.014 --> 12:48.223
When they would come to get us
at the children's home...

12:48.284 --> 12:50.355
to introduce us to the word of God...

12:50.419 --> 12:53.866
they would recite the sermon
of Jesus from the Bible...

12:53.923 --> 12:57.530
when the priests brought us in.

12:57.593 --> 13:00.267
When I had to serve them as altar boy...

13:00.329 --> 13:03.003
and we had to serve
the chalice to them.

13:03.065 --> 13:06.603
And there were a bunch of priests
that would touch their genitals.

13:06.669 --> 13:10.811
There must have been like three priests
who touched their genitals.

13:10.873 --> 13:16.118
Then they would proceed to masturbation,
self-masturbation...

13:16.178 --> 13:19.819
that they would perform
by moving their foreskin.

13:19.882 --> 13:24.456
You could see very clearly how
the foreskin Went back and forth...

13:24.520 --> 13:29.697
back and forth
until the ejaculation came.

13:29.759 --> 13:31.261
Then they would molest us-

13:31.327 --> 13:34.797
I knew it. Silva, I told you.

13:34.864 --> 13:38.778
- They would penetrate us anally-
- I told you this shit would happen!

13:38.834 --> 13:41.280
And they would come on our faces.

13:41.337 --> 13:45.251
Why am I in this house?
Why am I in this fucking house?

13:45.307 --> 13:48.845
- L knew it! I told you, Silva!
- Stop it. Don't yell.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.481
You. Hey, you.

13:50.546 --> 13:53.026
I know you're in there,
Father Matias Lozcano.

13:53.082 --> 13:56.256
- Is that one of your kids?
- Remember coming on our faces?

13:56.318 --> 13:59.595
Is that one of your kids, degenerate?

13:59.655 --> 14:00.656
Go talk to him!

14:00.723 --> 14:03.169
You'd make me pray and then you'd say-

14:04.660 --> 14:09.541
“That's not oral sex, fucking orphan.
This is oral sex!”

14:09.598 --> 14:11.839
And you'd stick your penis in my mouth.

14:11.901 --> 14:14.404
It was a big penis, like this.

14:14.470 --> 14:19.010
And since I was a child, sometimes
the corners of my mouth would hurt.

14:19.074 --> 14:25.047
As a child, my mouth couldn't open
wide enough for a priest's penis...

14:25.114 --> 14:27.355
but he'd do it to me anyway.

14:29.585 --> 14:34.364
And sometimes, the semen
would make me vomit.

14:36.559 --> 14:40.439
The semen would make me vomit.

14:41.964 --> 14:45.639
Later, the priest would give me
breath mints.

14:45.701 --> 14:49.012
Excuse me, mister!

14:49.071 --> 14:51.244
That way, the semen
wouldn't feel so dirty.

14:51.307 --> 14:55.153
- Why don't you come in?
- So strange, so salty.

14:55.211 --> 14:59.159
- The priests thought highly of themselves.
- Please, sir.

14:59.215 --> 15:01.718
- Please! Come in.
- He'd say, “Look.

15:01.784 --> 15:04.060
Everything you see around you...

15:04.720 --> 15:06.722
is the work of God.”

15:06.789 --> 15:09.269
And I would tell the priest-

15:09.325 --> 15:11.032
Enough, Father Matias.

15:11.093 --> 15:12.595
Go outside.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.937
Go give that guy a bad scare...

15:14.997 --> 15:18.638
before the whole town hears
the ruckus he's making.

15:18.701 --> 15:20.806
- I don't know him.
- Yes, you do!

15:20.870 --> 15:23.908
Go to the Window!
Look at him!

15:23.973 --> 15:26.715
Don't you recognize him?
He recognizes you!

15:26.775 --> 15:28.482
You take care of this!

15:29.411 --> 15:31.914
Father Matias, listen to me!

15:31.981 --> 15:33.961
Scare him, you hear?

15:34.016 --> 15:36.860
And he eats the foreskin.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.722
You're a degenerate!
Go outside!

15:39.788 --> 15:44.203
- I don't know him.
- Go outside! Don't play dumb!

15:44.994 --> 15:47.838
They'd take us to the bathroom
and we would suck their penises.

15:47.897 --> 15:49.968
We'd make love again.

15:50.032 --> 15:54.071
We'd come back from Burger King,
with a Happy Meal.

15:54.136 --> 15:58.050
We'd come back from buying beer,
and they'd make love to us again.

15:58.707 --> 16:02.780
“You will be my child
While you eat the head of the glans...

16:02.845 --> 16:04.722
and you move back fast...

16:04.780 --> 16:09.889
and you eat and swallow
that vital seminal fluid...

16:09.952 --> 16:15.061
that eventually will enter
into your body, my son.

16:15.124 --> 16:19.334
Because you have been
with the messenger of God.”

16:19.395 --> 16:21.966
“The Lord has touched me.

16:22.031 --> 16:25.843
The Lord has touched me,”
you used to tell me.

17:16.018 --> 17:18.191
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

17:18.252 --> 17:21.029
Blessed art thou among women,
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

17:21.089 --> 17:25.232
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of death. Amen.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.467
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

17:27.529 --> 17:30.237
Blessed art thou among women,
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

17:30.299 --> 17:34.714
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of death. Amen.

17:34.770 --> 17:35.976
Hail Mary, full of-

17:36.038 --> 17:40.714
Of course, we stayed inside
because we were very soared.

17:40.776 --> 17:42.619
You're saying this is a-

17:42.678 --> 17:44.487
A retreat for priests...

17:44.546 --> 17:47.652
who can no longer work
and must leave their parishes.

17:47.716 --> 17:52.187
He was very sad, very worried.
He didn't Want to eat or drink.

17:52.254 --> 17:55.633
Nothing. Not even tea.
He didn't want-

17:55.691 --> 17:58.638
He didn't Want to pray or sing.

17:58.694 --> 18:03.074
We were sitting at the table
watching a reality show...

18:03.132 --> 18:05.908
when he suddenly got upset
about something.

18:05.968 --> 18:07.777
He Went downstairs...

18:09.371 --> 18:12.215
and came back with a gun.

18:12.274 --> 18:15.778
We got scared and hid in the bathroom.

18:19.014 --> 18:21.585
After a While, we heard a gunshot.

18:23.919 --> 18:25.865
You should rest.

18:26.755 --> 18:28.428
Here's What will happen.

18:28.490 --> 18:31.437
We came here and collected
the necessary evidence.

18:31.493 --> 18:34.906
Well Wait for ballistics
and give you a call, all right?

18:34.963 --> 18:38.206
- All right. I’m sorry.
- Excuse me.

18:38.267 --> 18:40.144
I said he suddenly got upset...

18:40.202 --> 18:43.945
that I didn't know why he Went
downstairs and got a gun...

18:44.006 --> 18:47.783
and that we were scared
and hid in the bathroom.

18:47.843 --> 18:49.516
And that we heard the gunshot.

18:49.578 --> 18:55.859
<i>Forgiveness, oh, God</i>

18:55.918 --> 19:04.463
<i>Forgiveness in your presence</i>

19:04.526 --> 19:13.276
<i>Forgiveness and clemency</i>

19:13.335 --> 19:21.186
<i>Forgiveness and mercy</i>

19:22.177 --> 19:29.391
<i>Forgiveness, oh, God</i>

19:29.451 --> 19:35.925
<i>Forgiveness in your presence</i>

19:35.991 --> 19:42.966
<i>Forgiveness and clemency</i>

19:43.031 --> 19:48.709
<i>Forgiveness and mercy</i>

19:49.938 --> 19:53.442
Father Matias suffered from
heart attack symptoms some time ago.

19:53.509 --> 19:55.420
He was under medical supervision.

19:55.477 --> 19:58.287
They performed many tests on him.

19:58.347 --> 20:01.021
And no one ever mentioned
any symptoms of depression.

20:01.717 --> 20:04.425
I am very surprised
he had a gun in his possession.

20:07.756 --> 20:10.293
I asked Father Garcia to come with me.

20:10.359 --> 20:12.032
He is a spiritual director...

20:12.094 --> 20:14.768
and has a lot of experience
dealing with crisis situations.

20:15.864 --> 20:18.538
He has been on assignment
in many countries.

20:18.600 --> 20:22.639
He also received a degree in psychology
in Spain and studied in Geneva.

20:22.704 --> 20:26.117
He is very prepared...

20:27.009 --> 20:29.011
and a beautiful man.

20:41.623 --> 20:43.762
I remembered where I saw
Father Garcia before.

20:43.826 --> 20:46.932
In a seminar organized
by some entrepreneurs.

20:46.995 --> 20:49.498
He gave a speech about poverty.

20:49.565 --> 20:51.567
Father Garcia is a Jesuit.

20:51.633 --> 20:54.273
You can just see he's a guilty rich guy.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.179
But guilty of What?

20:59.441 --> 21:02.513
Besides, if there were no more poor people,
there would be no more saints...

21:02.578 --> 21:04.251
and that would be a terrible thing.

21:04.313 --> 21:06.384
There have always been poor people.

21:06.448 --> 21:08.291
<i>They want to change the church.</i>

21:08.350 --> 21:12.457
Over 2,000 years old and ifs still here
and I like it the Way it is.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.467
There is only one church of God.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.196
Amen.

21:16.258 --> 21:19.535
Garcia came to sell us out.

21:19.595 --> 21:24.476
The church Washes its hands,
and we're left as scapegoats.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.703
They're going to screw us.

21:27.769 --> 21:30.613
They'll screw us, mark my Words.

22:11.013 --> 22:14.222
Father, we have a good life here.

22:14.283 --> 22:16.490
It's a nice life.

22:16.551 --> 22:18.622
The brothers are okay.

22:18.687 --> 22:22.567
They are healthy and clean of heart,
I promise you.

22:23.592 --> 22:27.870
They glow. If you had met them before,
you wouldn't believe the difference.

22:27.930 --> 22:32.037
We get up,
stick to a schedule, sing.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.979
We lead a holy life.

22:35.037 --> 22:39.213
It's very nice.
Really, very nice.

22:39.274 --> 22:45.156
Sister, we both know
why the brothers are here.

22:45.213 --> 22:49.889
What I need to know is
if they're aware of why they're here.

22:53.055 --> 22:56.127
- This house is not a spa.
- No.

22:56.191 --> 22:59.172
It isn't a retreat either.

22:59.227 --> 23:02.367
It's a center for prayer and penance.

23:02.431 --> 23:04.911
It's a place of repentance.

23:10.505 --> 23:13.008
You're one of those new priests.

23:16.178 --> 23:18.852
What I want is a new church.

23:21.850 --> 23:23.852
And I Want you to help me.

23:33.729 --> 23:35.402
Where were you, Father?

23:35.464 --> 23:37.410
I was with Rayo.

23:37.466 --> 23:40.447
A racing clog needs a lot of training.

23:41.536 --> 23:43.038
Is Rayo a racing dog?

23:43.105 --> 23:45.642
He's very valuable.
Worth over a million pesos.

23:45.707 --> 23:48.688
Last time,
we took those Turks to the cleaners.

23:48.744 --> 23:50.417
- The Manzurs.
- Excuse me?

23:50.479 --> 23:52.686
- We took them to the cleaners.
- No, you're wrong.

23:52.748 --> 23:56.059
Rayo is a stray that Father Vidal
found oh the street.

23:56.118 --> 23:59.122
We've just grown very fond of him,
but he's a mutt.

23:59.187 --> 24:03.192
How can that be, Sister?
He's very valuable, a thoroughbred.

24:03.258 --> 24:06.603
But he only eats scraps
and wags his tail all day.

24:06.661 --> 24:09.335
We mainly keep him
for protection, Father.

24:13.001 --> 24:16.039
Have you made money on that dog?

24:16.104 --> 24:18.106
Do you place bets?

24:19.041 --> 24:21.715
He's a greyhound, Father...

24:21.777 --> 24:25.190
the only dog mentioned in the Bible.

24:25.247 --> 24:29.457
He's a fast dog,
well defined and tough.

24:36.458 --> 24:38.404
I Went through his bag.

24:38.460 --> 24:42.135
He has your file,
and yours and mine.

24:42.197 --> 24:44.040
And the files of priests
at other homes.

24:44.599 --> 24:49.275
He has credit cards.
American Express.

24:49.337 --> 24:51.749
What happened with Lozcano
sped things up...

24:51.807 --> 24:54.447
but Father Garcia was coming anyway.

24:55.310 --> 24:57.221
He's on a mission.

24:58.246 --> 25:01.716
He's closing down the homes all over Chile.

25:01.783 --> 25:05.356
He closed the homes in Las Cabras
and in San Pedro.

25:31.279 --> 25:36.126
You and Father Matias Lozcano
had something in common.

25:36.184 --> 25:40.496
You were both excommunicated
for penetrating minors.

25:40.989 --> 25:43.435
I wouldn't know.
I never did that.

25:43.492 --> 25:45.768
You wrote a letter.

25:45.827 --> 25:48.364
I made the mistake of writing
to a bishop in Rome...

25:48.430 --> 25:50.637
to tell him how proud I was...

25:50.699 --> 25:54.010
of being able to suppress the desire
to sleep with another priest.

25:54.069 --> 25:55.912
Do you know What he asked in response?

25:55.971 --> 25:59.612
If I was also able to suppress
the desire to molest a child.

25:59.674 --> 26:01.210
“Of course,” I said. “Yes.”

26:01.276 --> 26:04.280
It's one thing to fall in love with a man...

26:04.946 --> 26:07.552
but a completely different one
to fall in love with a child.

26:08.049 --> 26:10.620
Because the sickness
of falling in love with a child...

26:10.685 --> 26:12.289
can be cured, repressed.

26:12.354 --> 26:16.461
I know a lot of men and Women
who think about children...

26:17.092 --> 26:18.935
but would be incapable of doing anything.

26:20.562 --> 26:24.772
But that bishop accused me of
defending pedophilia, and it isn't true.

26:24.833 --> 26:29.077
I was defending restraint.
And I know What I’m saying.

26:29.137 --> 26:32.675
I know What I’m talking about,
since I’m a master of restraint.

26:35.677 --> 26:37.350
Do you still think about men?

26:39.447 --> 26:42.121
You're horribly vile.

26:43.518 --> 26:46.863
It's just that you took a vow
of chastity many years ago...

26:46.922 --> 26:51.428
and have spent all this time thinking
about Obscenities instead of praying.

26:51.493 --> 26:54.702
You haven’t made love to anyone.
You haven’t fornicated.

26:54.763 --> 26:57.266
So you don't know What it feels like.

26:58.233 --> 27:03.182
You don't know the sickness of the mind
can be cured when the body explodes.

27:03.905 --> 27:08.376
Because you and I are condemned
to be dishonest bodies.

27:09.744 --> 27:13.988
If you were to make
any kind of confession...

27:14.049 --> 27:17.656
I'd begin to believe
What you're telling me.

27:18.887 --> 27:21.367
Okay.

27:21.423 --> 27:23.869
I could tell you that...

27:23.925 --> 27:27.532
I asked that boy
to sleep in my bed with me.

27:27.596 --> 27:29.803
We hugged. We prayed.

27:31.533 --> 27:33.638
We-

27:33.702 --> 27:37.013
We slept face to face.
I breathed in his breath.

27:40.542 --> 27:43.216
He knew my brain
was twice as big as his...

27:43.278 --> 27:45.519
and used me to survive.

27:45.580 --> 27:49.585
I lent him my robe
and colored his lips red.

27:50.151 --> 27:51.824
Those things happen.

27:51.886 --> 27:53.388
They happen.

27:54.289 --> 27:57.168
- You spent 35 years in the army.
- Yes.

27:57.225 --> 27:59.728
- Always as a chaplain?
- Always.

27:59.794 --> 28:03.640
A house, a car, a security detail,
a good life, power.

28:05.033 --> 28:08.708
I ask because it couldn't have been easy
to leave that behind.

28:11.072 --> 28:13.575
- Does your family come to visit?
- No.

28:19.080 --> 28:21.185
The bishop told me you had a notebook.

28:21.249 --> 28:25.994
Yes. I wrote down everything
the soldiers confessed.

28:26.054 --> 28:27.556
What did you write down?

28:27.622 --> 28:31.160
Secret burial grounds, theft of money.

28:31.226 --> 28:35.197
Secret torture houses,
murders. Everything.

28:36.097 --> 28:38.839
- Then I burnt it.
- Why?

28:38.900 --> 28:41.813
Because a colonel
threatened to kill me.

28:41.870 --> 28:43.781
It didn't matter, I memorized it.

28:44.572 --> 28:47.178
A lot of soldiers repented.

28:47.242 --> 28:49.153
But those left-Wing civilians...

28:49.210 --> 28:53.158
Wanted to resolve a spiritual matter
in a secular court.

28:54.449 --> 28:57.896
They realized it was
their only chance at revenge...

28:57.952 --> 29:00.432
because God would forgive
all of them in heaven.

29:00.488 --> 29:01.990
Even the murderers.

29:02.724 --> 29:05.204
You studied for years
to become a priest.

29:05.260 --> 29:08.207
You gave your life
to our Lord Jesus Christ...

29:08.263 --> 29:11.267
but that doesn’t make you
a messenger of God.

29:11.333 --> 29:14.940
So set aside your arrogance
and lead the life you have to lead...

29:15.003 --> 29:16.676
the life of an accomplice.

29:16.738 --> 29:19.685
They put you in this house
to keep you quiet.

29:19.741 --> 29:24.918
I won't claim to be innocent, but please
do not try to manipulate a cunning fox...

29:24.979 --> 29:28.688
who during his long life as a priest
has touched more communion bread...

29:28.750 --> 29:31.594
than you have touched your own member.

29:34.456 --> 29:36.129
I’m checking-

29:36.191 --> 29:38.398
You don't have a file. No.

29:39.828 --> 29:41.865
What's your first name?

29:43.498 --> 29:45.171
Are you listening?

29:48.303 --> 29:50.112
Father Ramirez.

29:50.939 --> 29:53.215
Do you understand what's going on?

29:56.444 --> 29:58.390
Brother, can you see me?

30:01.049 --> 30:02.756
An angel.

30:05.520 --> 30:07.591
An angel?

30:07.655 --> 30:10.363
Yes, but dark.

30:11.559 --> 30:14.062
A black person?

30:14.596 --> 30:16.598
No, a poor man.

30:19.067 --> 30:21.809
He used swear Words.

30:21.870 --> 30:27.843
There were three priests
who touched their genitals.

30:27.909 --> 30:33.825
Then they would proceed to masturbation,
self-masturbation...

30:33.882 --> 30:38.922
that they would perform...

30:38.987 --> 30:43.060
by moving their foreskin...

30:43.124 --> 30:47.698
back and forth, back and forth.

30:47.762 --> 30:52.609
They would penetrate them anally and...

30:53.401 --> 30:57.679
then came the oral part.

30:57.739 --> 31:00.117
And they would make love to us...

31:00.175 --> 31:02.382
and come on our faces.

31:04.679 --> 31:07.683
Are you telling me something
you're imagining?

32:10.979 --> 32:12.925
Let's get it up.

32:12.981 --> 32:14.153
Ready.

32:14.215 --> 32:15.717
Let's go.

32:17.519 --> 32:19.521
Do you need workers?

32:25.793 --> 32:27.295
I’m qualified.

33:23.251 --> 33:26.596
Are you doing interviews
in all the houses?

33:26.654 --> 33:28.656
Have you done this before?

33:30.191 --> 33:31.864
And you, Sister?

33:32.827 --> 33:35.831
What does your family think
of you living so far away?

33:37.098 --> 33:39.339
The Lord is my family.

33:39.400 --> 33:41.812
- And the Lord is everywhere.
- Amen.

33:41.869 --> 33:43.371
Amen.

33:43.438 --> 33:45.384
Look, that dog may be valuable...

33:45.440 --> 33:48.614
but we didn't buy it,
we found him on the streets.

33:48.676 --> 33:51.850
Purebred dogs left on the streets?

33:51.913 --> 33:55.588
They abandon them so their champions
won't breed with mongrels.

33:56.317 --> 33:58.319
It's necessary, Father.

33:59.053 --> 34:02.057
Prayer and a little recreation.

34:04.025 --> 34:06.266
What's going on with Father Ramirez?

34:06.327 --> 34:08.204
There's no information about him.

34:08.262 --> 34:11.766
There are no files. I called Santiago,
and they can't help either.

34:13.266 --> 34:15.770
I was told he arrived here
in the late 'SOs...

34:15.837 --> 34:17.679
but beyond that...

34:18.806 --> 34:21.980
nobody knows,
and he doesn't remember.

34:24.178 --> 34:26.248
Where do you Want me to put this?

34:41.362 --> 34:45.071
- When are the races?
- Sunday at 4:00.

34:46.601 --> 34:48.547
- Can I have two sea bass'?
- Two'?

34:48.603 --> 34:51.277
- With heads and spines removed, please.
- Sure.

35:56.204 --> 35:58.241
My God.

35:59.707 --> 36:01.311
I don't think he's dangerous.

36:01.375 --> 36:04.447
Neither do I.
Deep down, he's a good man.

36:04.512 --> 36:07.584
Please. That guy wants
to take advantage of us.

36:07.648 --> 36:10.390
- We need a gun.
- Father Silva, please.

36:10.451 --> 36:14.228
Don't you want to defend yourself?
He'll humiliate us, harass us.

36:14.288 --> 36:17.360
- He'll do terrible things to us.
- It's okay.

36:17.425 --> 36:22.431
I don't know about you,
but I don't wish to be penetrated.

36:22.497 --> 36:24.477
That word is not very holy, Father.

36:24.532 --> 36:27.035
Then, let's call the police.

36:29.437 --> 36:33.385
This spiritual director...

36:34.208 --> 36:36.210
would place his hand like this...

36:37.311 --> 36:38.984
and would say...

36:39.714 --> 36:41.387
“Come.”

36:43.451 --> 36:45.260
And the idiots would go to him.

36:45.319 --> 36:48.630
No, but wait.
They would go to him.

36:48.689 --> 36:54.332
And I, reluctant, but an idiot,
because I don't have spiritual directors...

36:56.364 --> 37:00.176
felt like a magnet, like this.

37:01.035 --> 37:02.309
Right?

37:02.370 --> 37:08.013
“Come. Come! Come!”

37:08.910 --> 37:10.082
Of course.

37:13.247 --> 37:14.453
Okay.

37:19.554 --> 37:23.229
From now on, the consumption
of alcohol is forbidden in this house.

37:24.659 --> 37:28.232
- More prayer, less outings.
- Forbidden? No.

37:28.296 --> 37:30.503
More penance, less dog.

37:30.565 --> 37:32.306
More vegetables, less chicken.

37:32.366 --> 37:35.575
More vegetables, less chicken.

37:39.607 --> 37:42.247
More vegetables, less-

37:42.310 --> 37:43.584
What's wrong?

37:43.644 --> 37:47.683
There are no doors or keys in this house,
so you can leave Whenever you please.

37:47.748 --> 37:51.457
But as long as you live under
the church’s roof, you'll follow its rules.

37:51.519 --> 37:54.500
And right now, for you,
I am the church!

37:54.555 --> 37:56.796
- I am the church!
- No.

37:58.993 --> 38:03.169
How many years of priesthood
are there between all of us? Shit!

38:05.833 --> 38:07.506
Sister, take him to his room.

38:08.269 --> 38:11.648
- Take him immediately.
- Father, come. Come.

38:11.706 --> 38:14.050
Come here. Come. Stand up.

38:14.108 --> 38:16.714
Careful. Be careful. Come.

38:16.777 --> 38:18.313
Criminals!

38:20.147 --> 38:21.820
Let's go.

38:22.650 --> 38:25.062
Come on. Be careful. Come.

38:25.119 --> 38:26.792
Come on.

38:37.732 --> 38:42.909
When I was a missionary in Africa,
we would give a goat to each family.

38:42.970 --> 38:47.350
That goat would produce milk,
meat and cheese.

38:48.309 --> 38:51.518
It would allow them to grow.
That goat gave them life.

38:51.579 --> 38:53.252
When the goat got old...

38:53.314 --> 38:57.956
they would offer it as a sacrifice
to our Lord Jesus Christ.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.331
Father.

39:01.389 --> 39:03.369
What does this dog offer this house?

39:05.693 --> 39:07.366
Affection.

39:08.195 --> 39:09.572
Avarice.

39:09.630 --> 39:13.134
- You have to get rid of the dog.
- No.

39:13.200 --> 39:15.680
If I let you keep that clog,
you will keep on betting...

39:15.736 --> 39:17.443
and I cannot allow that.

39:17.505 --> 39:19.678
- Get a cat.
- I don't like cats.

39:19.740 --> 39:23.051
Look at yourself.
A cat would suit you better.

39:26.647 --> 39:28.422
- Excuse me?
- The commissions.

39:28.482 --> 39:29.984
The commissions?

39:32.486 --> 39:33.760
The commissions.

39:34.488 --> 39:36.490
How much did you make?

39:36.557 --> 39:38.537
Not as much as you.

39:39.760 --> 39:42.070
You are a Vatican bureaucrat...

39:42.129 --> 39:46.373
who travels in first class
and stays at five-star hotels.

39:47.168 --> 39:51.617
I can smell your perfume from here,
Carolina Herrera for Men.

39:53.741 --> 39:56.984
You buy it at duty-free shops.
Am I wrong?

39:57.044 --> 39:59.285
How long has it been
since you were in a parish?

39:59.347 --> 40:02.885
With people, suffering people.

40:02.950 --> 40:05.294
With Women who cannot bear children.

40:06.153 --> 40:09.999
With girls who don't want their children
and want to throw them in the trash'?

40:10.057 --> 40:13.630
Why? Why such injustice?

40:14.328 --> 40:17.366
So God gave me a mission-
to save lives.

40:19.400 --> 40:23.109
To bring happiness to those couples
that cannot have children, Father.

40:23.170 --> 40:27.312
Father, we're talking about
the kidnapping of live children...

40:28.442 --> 40:31.946
who are given to other mothers
that are not their own.

40:32.013 --> 40:34.721
And after a funeral
with an empty coffin-

40:34.782 --> 40:38.594
- What else could I do?
- with a 17-year-old mother in tears-

40:38.652 --> 40:40.825
Those girls didn't Want
to have those children.

40:40.888 --> 40:44.233
It's a question of social class.
You understand that, don't you?

40:44.291 --> 40:45.793
Of your social class.

40:45.860 --> 40:49.433
They couldn't have them,
they didn't Want to have them.

40:49.497 --> 40:53.274
They rejected them!
They Wanted to throw them in the trash!

40:57.705 --> 41:00.117
I only saved lives, sir.

41:00.174 --> 41:02.450
Now there are blondes in the slums.

41:03.110 --> 41:06.523
And dark-skinned kids
in the upper-class neighborhoods...

41:06.580 --> 41:09.322
with families that love them
and take care of them.

41:15.289 --> 41:19.237
Has it ever occurred to you
that you're a criminal?

41:47.621 --> 41:49.692
What else do you do in this house?

41:50.624 --> 41:53.503
I count the slices of bologna.

41:53.561 --> 41:56.735
I make sure nobody puts
too much butter on their bread.

41:56.797 --> 41:58.868
I count the tablespoons of sugar.

41:58.933 --> 42:01.311
I count the bulbs that burn out.

42:01.368 --> 42:04.349
I count the needles
so they don't get lost.

42:04.405 --> 42:06.612
I keep track of how long
they spend in the bathroom.

42:06.674 --> 42:08.347
Long showers are forbidden.

42:09.376 --> 42:11.117
Where do you hide the gun?

42:11.178 --> 42:14.352
No guns.
You know who carries those.

42:14.415 --> 42:16.759
Why ask me?

42:16.817 --> 42:18.694
To know What to do.

42:18.752 --> 42:21.824
But if you've noticed,
everything is fine here now.

42:22.690 --> 42:26.365
He was very sick when he arrived.
That's why he killed himself.

42:27.895 --> 42:31.240
- Why were you sent here?
- During Pope John Paul's visit...

42:31.298 --> 42:33.505
something terrible happened to me.

42:33.567 --> 42:38.277
I had to quit college, ended up
in a convent and became a nun.

42:38.339 --> 42:41.513
First in Brazil and then in Boston,
some time ago.

42:41.575 --> 42:43.987
But then I Went to Africa.

42:44.044 --> 42:45.990
Black Africa.

42:46.046 --> 42:48.617
I adopted a girl
and brought her here with me.

42:48.682 --> 42:53.290
After a while, they took her away from me
because they said I beat her...

42:53.354 --> 42:55.425
and gave her to another family.

42:55.489 --> 42:57.366
But I never laid a hand on her.

42:57.424 --> 42:59.768
It was my mother
who said I beat the girl...

42:59.827 --> 43:03.741
because she didn't Want
a black granddaughter.

43:03.797 --> 43:06.437
But you are no longer a nun officially.

43:06.500 --> 43:09.208
So I called an uncle
who had some connections...

43:09.270 --> 43:12.251
and told him I had to pay for my sins...

43:12.306 --> 43:14.809
and needed to do my penance.

43:14.875 --> 43:17.719
So he called me,
asked me if I liked the sea...

43:17.778 --> 43:20.486
and told me I would be a jail keeper.

43:23.017 --> 43:25.725
We're going to have to
close down this house.

43:25.786 --> 43:27.390
- That's not necessary.
- Why not?

43:27.454 --> 43:29.934
No one else will die here.

47:03.570 --> 47:05.572
Hi. Do you need a hand?

47:08.976 --> 47:11.684
- Do you need a hand?
- No, thanks, buddy.

47:12.479 --> 47:14.322
Are you from Santiago?

47:15.549 --> 47:17.256
From Las Condes.

47:18.051 --> 47:19.928
- And you?
- From Santiago.

47:19.987 --> 47:22.991
- Where exactly?
- Downtown Santiago.

47:24.024 --> 47:26.470
But I’ve lived here
in La Boca, for years.

47:26.527 --> 47:30.600
<i>One “me, we went to La Boca
WNW (Data to buy some booze...</i>

47:30.664 --> 47:32.803
and a punk Wanted to touch her hair.

47:32.866 --> 47:34.539
He had never seen a redhead.

47:34.601 --> 47:37.047
How creepy.
That's just wrong.

47:37.104 --> 47:39.948
The punk was so drunk,
he Wanted to touch me.

47:40.007 --> 47:44.251
This jerk says, “For 15,000 pesos,
you can touch her tit.

47:44.311 --> 47:48.054
But for 30,000, you can fuck her.”
That's What he said.

47:48.115 --> 47:51.722
- That's messed up!
- I swear to God.

47:51.785 --> 47:55.631
I just stared at him, like,
“Stop it, Gonzalo. What's Wrong with you?”

47:55.689 --> 48:00.035
And the dude shows up
with around 25,000 pesos.

48:00.093 --> 48:01.800
So I look at him and say-

48:01.862 --> 48:06.868
“Shit, you're 5,000 pesos short.
Want me to lend it to you?”

48:09.136 --> 48:12.811
- How about that?
- You never told me this.

48:12.873 --> 48:14.443
I offered him the money.

48:14.508 --> 48:16.454
No, and the punks were furious.

48:16.510 --> 48:18.751
And this idiot couldn't do anything but-

48:18.812 --> 48:20.758
I threw a couple of good punches...

48:20.814 --> 48:23.590
two rights to the face,
and it was all over.

48:26.553 --> 48:28.555
What's up with that?

48:33.193 --> 48:34.797
I can't believe you never told me!

48:52.079 --> 48:53.752
Relax.

48:55.816 --> 48:56.988
Hello.

48:58.085 --> 48:59.996
Two. One.

49:00.053 --> 49:01.123
Run!

49:01.188 --> 49:04.101
- He's off.
- Come on.

50:29.109 --> 50:32.318
- Where are you going, Brother?
- Home.

50:49.896 --> 50:53.070
The brothers and I
Wanted to help you.

50:56.103 --> 50:57.946
All right.

50:58.572 --> 51:01.382
How many priests live in that house?

51:01.441 --> 51:03.921
Are all of you homosexuals?

51:03.977 --> 51:05.251
Look.

51:06.146 --> 51:11.528
God also created homosexuals.
He created them.

51:11.585 --> 51:14.930
He's proud of them.
Proud of who they are.

51:14.988 --> 51:18.367
I am celibate, for example.
I’m celibate.

51:18.425 --> 51:21.929
Of my own free will,
I decided not to have a wife, children.

51:23.764 --> 51:26.176
So you're celibate
because you haven't been with a woman...

51:26.233 --> 51:28.235
but you have been with men?

51:28.301 --> 51:32.943
Have they penetrated you anally?
Have you sucked a penis, foreskin?

51:33.006 --> 51:35.350
Are you homosexual?

51:35.409 --> 51:41.223
Homosexuality has broadened
my concept of sexuality.

51:41.281 --> 51:44.262
Between a man and a woman,
its just a matter of procreation.

51:44.317 --> 51:47.821
Whereas, between homosexuals,
it's something much deeper.

51:48.922 --> 51:53.564
The priest used to tell me that if I Wanted
to be a virgin when I got married...

51:53.627 --> 51:56.574
I should just have anal sex.

51:56.630 --> 51:58.906
He would penetrate me anally...

51:58.965 --> 52:01.912
so I could be a virgin
when I got married.

52:01.968 --> 52:05.575
Well, you are a son of God as well.

52:05.639 --> 52:08.381
Your homosexuality humanizes me.

52:08.442 --> 52:10.752
You gotta be kidding me.

52:10.811 --> 52:13.087
Don't call me a homosexual.

52:13.146 --> 52:15.717
Don't go around saying that.

52:15.782 --> 52:19.127
Otherwise, I could be a victim
of discrimination.

52:19.186 --> 52:23.362
Just feel like the son of God you are,
who's on his own path to holiness.

52:27.494 --> 52:31.806
I feel as if you were counseling me.

52:31.865 --> 52:33.538
Like a confession.

52:35.635 --> 52:37.945
- Why don't you hear my confession?
- I can't.

52:38.004 --> 52:39.506
Why not?

52:41.308 --> 52:44.187
Because I wouldn't be able
to keep your secret.

52:47.247 --> 52:49.591
How long are you going to be here?

52:51.251 --> 52:53.253
A long time.

52:56.056 --> 52:58.058
Excuse me.

52:58.825 --> 53:02.136
Hey, I'll come visit you.

53:02.195 --> 53:07.269
Who knows? Maybe we'll both
stop being celibate, chaste.

53:07.334 --> 53:11.646
Come on, Father. Let's make love.
What's the big deal?

53:11.705 --> 53:16.950
Invite me over. Look, if you do,
I can fuck all the priests if you like!

53:17.010 --> 53:19.217
I can fuck them one by one!

53:19.279 --> 53:22.556
It would be beautiful.
We would all reach holiness!

53:22.616 --> 53:24.459
Penetration!

53:34.661 --> 53:38.905
Do you think anyone
will come looking for me?

53:39.399 --> 53:41.538
No one will.

53:43.303 --> 53:45.874
I need to screw them all.

53:47.107 --> 53:52.523
I need to screw them
the same Way they screwed me.

53:55.649 --> 53:58.630
I'd chop their heads off, their arms.

53:58.685 --> 54:03.031
I'd make a terrible soup,
a terrible broth.

54:03.089 --> 54:05.569
I'd make myself a priest stew.

54:13.433 --> 54:15.310
I'd like to...

54:17.037 --> 54:21.042
kiss you to death
and bring you back to life with my cock.

55:08.154 --> 55:09.656
What's going on?

55:12.893 --> 55:16.170
- Come on.
- You like that? Do you?

55:29.910 --> 55:31.583
Keep going.

55:34.281 --> 55:35.453
Keep going.

55:35.515 --> 55:36.687
Leave.

55:37.918 --> 55:39.829
- Harder.
- Leave.

55:40.620 --> 55:43.499
- Harder.
- Leave, motherfucker!

55:44.424 --> 55:47.030
Go on. Fuck off.

55:47.093 --> 55:50.097
Leave! Leave!

56:03.743 --> 56:07.816
I know you have to go back to Santiago
with a priest in chains...

56:07.881 --> 56:10.885
so nobody asks about
“those bad priests” anymore.

56:11.785 --> 56:14.959
If you don't confess,
I'll take the dog away.

56:16.289 --> 56:18.394
Why is it when anybody
wants to punish me...

56:18.458 --> 56:21.405
they threaten to take the dog away?

56:21.461 --> 56:23.634
I haven't threatened you with that.

56:24.731 --> 56:29.146
But you thought about it,
because you Want to break me.

56:32.005 --> 56:34.076
The dog wags his tail when he sees me.

56:34.140 --> 56:37.553
He walks with me.
Sometimes he looks at me.

56:37.610 --> 56:40.648
I imagine you're aware
that the dog is not a person.

56:40.714 --> 56:43.251
Of course.

56:43.316 --> 56:48.698
But when I spend a lot of time with him,
I feel like he becomes more human.

56:50.757 --> 56:53.636
I feel he wants to humiliate me...

56:53.693 --> 56:57.231
and wants to know
exactly What I’m thinking.

56:57.731 --> 57:01.076
You humanize the dog.
And the dog-

57:01.134 --> 57:03.136
What about the dog?

57:03.203 --> 57:05.581
The dog animalizes you.

57:06.873 --> 57:10.946
Now you will have to leave this house
and face justice.

57:13.313 --> 57:17.489
But I won't leave you alone.
I will accompany you.

57:17.550 --> 57:19.621
Thank you very much.

57:22.655 --> 57:26.626
When I came outside,
he was face down.

57:28.528 --> 57:30.235
Was there blood?

57:30.296 --> 57:32.640
Yes, there was blood on the ground.

57:33.933 --> 57:37.210
- Was there a gun?
- Yes.

57:37.771 --> 57:41.913
Why does a priest
that had been accused...

57:41.975 --> 57:45.855
end up shooting himself in the head?

57:45.912 --> 57:47.823
Where did that gun come from?

57:47.881 --> 57:49.827
It's unbelievable.

57:49.883 --> 57:52.159
It doesn't seem unbelievable to me.

57:52.218 --> 57:55.665
We were drinking tea,
watching a reality show...

57:55.722 --> 57:58.032
when he got upset, got up-

58:02.629 --> 58:04.631
Where did the Father come from?

58:06.199 --> 58:07.200
I don't know.

58:07.267 --> 58:09.941
He said he was from Chillan.
A “Chillanejo.”

58:13.673 --> 58:16.745
- “Chillanense.”
- Whatever.

58:16.810 --> 58:18.653
Where did he get it?

58:20.280 --> 58:23.750
You can buy them.
I would guess.

58:23.817 --> 58:25.524
Where do you buy them?

58:26.186 --> 58:28.427
I don't know, Father.

58:28.488 --> 58:30.559
In the cities.

58:30.623 --> 58:32.466
Haven’t you been in any city?

58:33.693 --> 58:37.402
Or in a pool hall, a strip club.

58:38.431 --> 58:41.275
You think Father Matias
Went to a strip club?

58:41.334 --> 58:45.407
I don't know.
Who hasn't been to a strip club, Father?

58:48.374 --> 58:50.911
But not to buy a gun.

58:50.977 --> 58:53.457
If you think they're trying to kill you-

58:54.347 --> 58:56.793
I have a confession to make.

58:58.418 --> 59:01.592
There are strange noises here.

59:02.889 --> 59:07.395
And we have to sleep
with our eyes open like demons.

59:08.528 --> 59:10.906
Yes, I got their confessions.

59:10.964 --> 59:14.207
- What did they tell you?
- Well, everything.

59:14.267 --> 59:18.010
Now we just need your version
to finish up...

59:18.071 --> 59:20.881
and close this house permanently.

59:20.940 --> 59:23.614
I got here about four centuries ago.

59:24.577 --> 59:27.319
Back then, they said that
the devil had created our kind.

59:27.380 --> 59:31.385
Now they say God created us
“to love our fellow man”...

59:31.451 --> 59:33.522
because ifs dirty.

59:33.586 --> 59:36.829
We love those who have dirty sex,
those who laugh at themselves...

59:36.890 --> 59:39.564
or humiliate themselves,
those who smoke in the bathroom...

59:39.626 --> 59:43.130
those who have to endure
idiotic questions from people like you...

59:43.196 --> 59:46.803
who think they know more than we do
because they sleep with women.

59:46.866 --> 59:48.903
But make no mistake,
I know more than you.

59:48.968 --> 59:52.211
I know something you don't.
I know more than you, I do.

59:52.272 --> 59:54.513
Because in that abject and deep sex...

59:54.574 --> 59:57.453
I’ve seen the most loving light
of our Lord.

59:58.511 --> 01:00:01.515
Do you know What I think
happened to Father Matias?

01:00:02.982 --> 01:00:04.655
He got here...

01:00:05.418 --> 01:00:07.625
to this shitty house...

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:09.689
that smells like shit...

01:00:11.457 --> 01:00:14.597
and saw these fucking geezers.

01:00:14.661 --> 01:00:18.666
Silva’s face. Vidal's face.

01:00:19.432 --> 01:00:21.469
He saw me too.

01:00:23.303 --> 01:00:25.613
All this shit.

01:00:25.672 --> 01:00:31.350
He thought, “I'll have to spend
the rest of my days in this shit!”

01:00:32.645 --> 01:00:34.147
And he shot himself.

01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:39.185
You are in a privileged place.

01:00:42.121 --> 01:00:45.432
God is here, Father.
Look around you. Nature, the sea.

01:00:45.491 --> 01:00:47.835
God is not here, Father.

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:51.535
This is a jail.
With fucking criminals!

01:00:55.368 --> 01:00:57.405
How many shots did you hear?

01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:58.972
One shot.

01:00:59.038 --> 01:01:04.386
The new priest killed himself
because another man came looking for him.

01:01:16.723 --> 01:01:18.202
Excuse me?

01:01:23.296 --> 01:01:27.870
“My son, everything around you
is the work of God.”

01:01:27.934 --> 01:01:31.040
And I would tell the priest-

01:01:31.738 --> 01:01:34.184
“Fm your child. Your child.

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.481
Priest, I’m your child.”

01:01:36.542 --> 01:01:39.022
And then, with the foreskin...

01:01:40.146 --> 01:01:42.626
he would eat the glans...

01:01:42.682 --> 01:01:44.684
and-

01:04:36.656 --> 01:04:41.935
Hey, hey! Come on!
How long will you make me stay here?

01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:47.569
I also have a right to holiness, don't I?

01:04:47.633 --> 01:04:50.273
I came following
Father Matias Lozcano.

01:04:50.336 --> 01:04:53.180
First I Went to Chillan.

01:04:53.239 --> 01:04:57.483
Then I had to follow him to Santiago,
and now I’ve come here...

01:04:57.543 --> 01:05:01.923
because my spiritual education
has not yet concluded.

01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:04.484
And like the Lamb of God...

01:05:05.451 --> 01:05:08.625
you only shut the door in my face.

01:05:10.356 --> 01:05:13.633
Why don't you come here
and talk with me?

01:05:13.693 --> 01:05:16.003
Or do you Want me to come up?

01:05:16.062 --> 01:05:18.941
You think I can't get up there?

01:05:23.236 --> 01:05:26.274
One day I'll come up there to see you.

01:05:27.707 --> 01:05:30.711
Why don't you invite me in for a snack?

01:05:36.115 --> 01:05:40.222
Maybe you see me and think,
“Where is this young man going?”

01:05:40.286 --> 01:05:42.323
Maybe it'll be hard for me
to talk about it...

01:05:42.388 --> 01:05:46.530
but I Want to go to a place
Where we can all raise awareness.

01:05:49.428 --> 01:05:54.810
I could steal from you now, but I won't
because I don't do that anymore. Look.

01:05:56.068 --> 01:05:58.571
Maybe you haven't seen the light.

01:05:59.772 --> 01:06:02.275
When you consume that light,
you don't see it.

01:06:02.341 --> 01:06:05.720
I see it, and I see you, and I say, “Hey!”

01:06:13.319 --> 01:06:17.324
That lunatic came after the poor priest
to kill him, I don't know.

01:06:19.158 --> 01:06:21.661
He screamed as if he was being stabbed.

01:06:22.895 --> 01:06:27.275
So we took out a small gun
that we keep in case of burglaries...

01:06:27.333 --> 01:06:30.974
and we gave it to the priest
so he could shoot a warning shot.

01:06:31.037 --> 01:06:34.041
But he was so distressed
that he shot himself.

01:06:36.108 --> 01:06:39.555
- Want to close down this house?
- What do you think?

01:06:39.612 --> 01:06:41.523
Want to send us to another house?

01:06:41.581 --> 01:06:45.757
- People are coming after these priests.
- That's why ifs not advisable.

01:06:48.754 --> 01:06:53.225
If they asked me,
I would be declared an accessory...

01:06:53.292 --> 01:06:56.466
and so would my accessory...

01:06:56.529 --> 01:06:59.408
as well as the accessory
of my accessory.

01:07:00.466 --> 01:07:03.936
All the Way up,
until they got to I don't know Who.

01:07:04.003 --> 01:07:04.845
You.

01:07:07.506 --> 01:07:10.043
Why talk now
if you haven't talked before?

01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:11.782
No, I don't Want to talk.

01:07:11.844 --> 01:07:14.654
The last thing I Want is to talk.

01:07:14.714 --> 01:07:19.390
But if you kick me out,
I'll have nothing to lose.

01:07:20.219 --> 01:07:21.960
You're an employee. You have to answer.

01:07:22.021 --> 01:07:25.298
If you kick us out,
I'll call the press and tell them everything.

01:08:08.934 --> 01:08:11.141
- Are you a priest?
- Yes.

01:08:14.006 --> 01:08:16.782
Did you know a priest died here in town?

01:08:16.841 --> 01:08:18.185
Yes.

01:08:18.978 --> 01:08:22.653
- He was a great man.
- A good man. A nice man.

01:08:22.715 --> 01:08:25.218
Why? Did you know him?

01:08:29.822 --> 01:08:31.665
How did you meet him?

01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:36.196
I can't remember, I was very young.

01:08:39.031 --> 01:08:41.705
Don't tell me Father Matias raised you.

01:08:44.937 --> 01:08:46.939
He raised me.

01:08:47.773 --> 01:08:50.481
But he's no longer with us.

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:52.386
I’m sorry. I didn't know.

01:09:00.118 --> 01:09:03.225
- Do you Want to pray?
- Okay.

01:09:15.901 --> 01:09:19.109
Our Father which art in heaven...

01:09:19.171 --> 01:09:21.048
hallowed be thy name.

01:09:21.107 --> 01:09:22.916
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done-

01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:25.715
Do you Want to leave?

01:09:25.778 --> 01:09:28.657
- Where to?
- To Santiago.

01:09:28.714 --> 01:09:31.694
I'll make a call, and they'll come
and take you to a home.

01:09:31.751 --> 01:09:34.254
- What do you mean a home?
- A different kind of home.

01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:37.823
A home with a family,
Without priests.

01:09:38.823 --> 01:09:40.997
- Without priests?
- Without priests.

01:09:45.497 --> 01:09:49.139
- Will I have my own bed?
- Yes. You'll have your own bed.

01:09:49.201 --> 01:09:50.737
Warm.

01:09:50.803 --> 01:09:53.750
- What's your name?
- Sandokan.

01:09:55.007 --> 01:09:58.682
Do you think Father Matias Lozcano
Went to heaven?

01:09:59.912 --> 01:10:01.084
No.

01:10:03.149 --> 01:10:04.321
No.

01:10:06.519 --> 01:10:10.331
L think his soul
is still Wandering around here...

01:10:10.389 --> 01:10:12.391
because of the sins he committed.

01:10:13.325 --> 01:10:18.900
The good news is he has you and I
to attest to his grace.

01:10:18.964 --> 01:10:21.376
- Because he was a good man.
- Yes.

01:10:21.433 --> 01:10:22.503
Yes.

01:10:22.568 --> 01:10:26.573
- He was a good man, a saint.
- Yes, a saint, an angel.

01:10:27.139 --> 01:10:29.915
- A man of God.
- An angel.

01:10:34.747 --> 01:10:35.919
Okay.

01:10:39.752 --> 01:10:42.426
Father Matias Lozcano was my-

01:10:45.825 --> 01:10:50.706
Let me tell you something.
Matias Lozcano was my first man.

01:10:50.763 --> 01:10:53.437
He was the first one I made love with.

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:58.041
The first man I loved
deeply and madly...

01:10:58.103 --> 01:11:00.583
to the farthest reaches of love.

01:11:00.639 --> 01:11:03.313
It was with Father Matias Lozcano.

01:11:05.277 --> 01:11:07.587
And he's no longer with me.

01:11:08.647 --> 01:11:13.153
The priest was the first person
I had sex with, both anally-

01:11:16.755 --> 01:11:19.497
The first time, I sucked his penis...

01:11:19.558 --> 01:11:22.061
and he showed me the grace of the Lord.

01:11:22.127 --> 01:11:24.767
He would say that
if I swallowed the semen...

01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:26.867
I would go directly to heaven...

01:11:26.932 --> 01:11:28.969
because any man of God...

01:11:30.436 --> 01:11:32.712
carries the holy semen...

01:11:32.771 --> 01:11:36.412
because it comes from the glory
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

01:11:36.475 --> 01:11:37.818
It is life.

01:11:37.877 --> 01:11:40.255
Because the Virgin Mary-

01:11:40.312 --> 01:11:43.816
Ultimately, God also
created her from semen.

01:11:46.385 --> 01:11:49.889
When was the last time you ejaculated?

01:11:54.693 --> 01:11:58.197
Have you had sex with children?

01:11:59.131 --> 01:12:03.409
L-lave you penetrated them anally?
That's nice.

01:12:03.469 --> 01:12:07.144
But I’m not a homosexual.
I lead a normal life.

01:12:07.206 --> 01:12:09.208
I have sex with women.

01:12:10.476 --> 01:12:13.548
Sometimes I feel I’m sinning
with the prostitutes and all that.

01:12:13.612 --> 01:12:16.024
But when I was with the priests...

01:12:16.081 --> 01:12:18.891
I never felt I was sinning
because they are men of God...

01:12:18.951 --> 01:12:23.525
and all the fluids that come out of them
are the Lords, right?

01:12:23.589 --> 01:12:26.092
Praise be to God.

01:12:39.471 --> 01:12:42.475
You know What? I know some children.

01:12:43.175 --> 01:12:45.086
They're smaller than me.

01:12:45.144 --> 01:12:49.286
Would you like to have sex
with the children I know?

01:14:31.884 --> 01:14:35.331
And I was able
to pull a gigantic floater.

01:14:35.387 --> 01:14:36.889
And the rest were in.

01:14:36.955 --> 01:14:40.562
L was looking at you from behind
While you pulled that floater.

01:14:40.626 --> 01:14:43.505
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:16:35.974 --> 01:16:39.148
Then I came to La Boca
and started a new life.

01:16:39.211 --> 01:16:42.385
I have my dogs,
my friends, my people.

01:16:42.447 --> 01:16:44.324
- What kind of dogs do you train?
- Greyhounds.

01:16:44.383 --> 01:16:46.192
Greyhounds. Great.

01:16:46.251 --> 01:16:50.666
Yes. Racing dogs.
Only champions.

01:16:50.722 --> 01:16:52.599
I'll be damned.

01:16:52.658 --> 01:16:54.331
Hey, buddy.

01:16:54.393 --> 01:16:56.236
Why did you come to La Boca?

01:16:56.295 --> 01:17:01.142
Why specifically La Boca,
such an old, sad and fucked-up town?

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:04.511
No. This town is beautiful.

01:17:04.570 --> 01:17:06.743
Beautiful, very, very beautiful.

01:17:06.805 --> 01:17:08.785
Truly beautiful.

01:17:33.632 --> 01:17:35.805
Come on.

01:17:41.573 --> 01:17:43.075
Come on.

01:18:36.261 --> 01:18:37.831
Were you together?

01:18:38.463 --> 01:18:40.739
We were, but not anymore.

01:18:41.967 --> 01:18:45.847
So if you're up for it,
she's available.

01:18:46.972 --> 01:18:51.148
Not in a million years
could you ever fuck a Woman like her.

01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:54.753
Do you always dress like that, man?

01:19:42.994 --> 01:19:45.873
- They killed Rayo too.
- What did you say, bitch?

01:19:45.931 --> 01:19:48.172
- They killed Rayo too.
- What? Where?

01:19:48.233 --> 01:19:51.009
I think I saw who it was.
He's Wandering around.

01:19:59.111 --> 01:20:00.818
They killed our dog, man.

01:20:00.879 --> 01:20:03.052
They killed my dog with glass.

01:20:07.285 --> 01:20:10.630
I Want to ask you to help me beat up-

01:20:13.525 --> 01:20:16.438
To chase a man out of town.

01:20:16.495 --> 01:20:19.408
Excuse me?
You Want us to beat-

01:20:19.464 --> 01:20:22.809
- Scare him, beat him up, hit him.
- You must be shitting me.

01:20:22.868 --> 01:20:26.145
No. He's a bad man, really bad.

01:20:26.204 --> 01:20:28.946
A bum who's been chasing me.

01:20:29.007 --> 01:20:31.180
- I’m scared.
- Wait a second.

01:20:31.243 --> 01:20:33.223
You must be shitting me.

01:20:33.278 --> 01:20:35.986
- Wait.
- This dude is shitting us.

01:20:36.047 --> 01:20:38.618
Shut up.
You're telling me to go find some dude?

01:20:38.683 --> 01:20:41.892
You Want me to beat up a stranger?

01:20:41.953 --> 01:20:44.695
What's Wrong with you, fucker?
You think I’m a thug?

01:20:50.495 --> 01:20:53.066
I'll kill you, motherfucker!

01:20:53.131 --> 01:20:55.441
I can pay you.

01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:56.672
What?

01:20:58.203 --> 01:21:00.740
Why don't you fuck off?

01:21:00.806 --> 01:21:03.286
Who do you think you're talking to, fucker?

01:21:03.341 --> 01:21:05.912
Everything was going great,
but you fucked it up.

01:21:19.558 --> 01:21:21.060
Hit him, man!

01:21:38.477 --> 01:21:41.947
Please. I’m scared.

01:21:42.881 --> 01:21:46.419
I’m a pastor. I’m a priest.

01:21:46.485 --> 01:21:48.624
- What?
- Help me, please.

01:21:48.687 --> 01:21:50.564
- You're shitting me.
- I’m scared.

01:21:51.289 --> 01:21:52.791
Fucking priest.

01:21:53.658 --> 01:21:55.695
Were there priests like him at school?

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:59.298
No. At school, the priests
would dress impeccably.

01:21:59.364 --> 01:22:01.344
They spoke English and Latin.

01:22:42.574 --> 01:22:46.112
- And the money?
- Money doesn't matter, man.

01:22:46.177 --> 01:22:47.679
Money?

01:22:47.746 --> 01:22:48.952
My ass!

01:22:53.652 --> 01:22:55.154
Fucking bum.

01:23:15.674 --> 01:23:20.180
Thank you, Sister.
You've done enough for today.

01:26:04.909 --> 01:26:06.911
Only God knows.

01:26:10.582 --> 01:26:12.255
He knows.

01:26:18.456 --> 01:26:22.131
We're girls,
that's why we don't understand.

01:26:23.661 --> 01:26:25.163
But he's the Father.

01:26:27.298 --> 01:26:29.642
He's the only one who knows.

01:26:37.242 --> 01:26:39.586
Are you going to kill me?

01:26:42.313 --> 01:26:46.090
No. I can't.

01:26:47.719 --> 01:26:49.721
Will you forgive me?

01:26:51.256 --> 01:26:52.428
No.

01:26:53.591 --> 01:26:55.366
No, bitch.

01:26:56.761 --> 01:26:57.762
No.

01:28:24.515 --> 01:28:26.495
You have to relax.

01:28:27.619 --> 01:28:30.327
I Want you to look at these people.

01:28:30.388 --> 01:28:32.061
Do you see them?

01:28:32.123 --> 01:28:34.967
They are good people
and will take care of you.

01:28:35.026 --> 01:28:39.441
- We're going to take care of him?
- Yes, you are.

01:28:44.369 --> 01:28:46.315
What does that mean, Father?

01:28:47.505 --> 01:28:52.011
It means he's had a difficult life,
and you, an easy one.

01:28:53.478 --> 01:28:55.788
But now he's happy and you're in hell.

01:28:55.847 --> 01:29:00.159
- He's not happy.
- He's better off than us.

01:29:00.218 --> 01:29:04.223
That's why I always liked to be
with the priests and nuns.

01:29:04.289 --> 01:29:07.702
Because that Way
I’m close to our Lord.

01:29:07.759 --> 01:29:11.002
That Way I’m happier, more protected.

01:29:12.730 --> 01:29:16.041
Maybe the brothers don't want
to share their breakfast with you.

01:29:19.704 --> 01:29:23.174
- He could stay here.
- What? Where?

01:29:25.410 --> 01:29:28.391
In my room. Until he gets better.

01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:31.792
- He can't stay here.
- Why not?

01:29:34.419 --> 01:29:35.921
Why not?

01:29:37.588 --> 01:29:40.467
First I'd like to talk this over
between ourselves.

01:29:40.525 --> 01:29:42.630
And I'd like to see all of you in jail.

01:29:43.962 --> 01:29:45.464
Then call the press.

01:29:45.530 --> 01:29:49.137
No. I love the church
and don't Want to hurt it.

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:51.146
What are you doing here then?

01:29:51.202 --> 01:29:55.708
If you give this man a bed,
I'll forget all about you.

01:29:55.773 --> 01:29:57.775
For how long?

01:29:59.644 --> 01:30:01.317
Forever.

01:30:05.450 --> 01:30:07.896
Any objections?

01:30:07.952 --> 01:30:09.693
Objections to What?

01:30:09.754 --> 01:30:12.098
To doing penance, Father.

01:30:12.724 --> 01:30:15.034
To that, never.

01:30:17.261 --> 01:30:19.263
I would rather leave.

01:30:20.898 --> 01:30:23.037
No, you're not leaving, Silva.

01:30:23.101 --> 01:30:25.103
I won't be leaving either.

01:30:25.703 --> 01:30:27.705
No one will leave.

01:30:30.975 --> 01:30:33.819
How could we pass up
this Wonderful opportunity...

01:30:33.878 --> 01:30:37.758
that the new church is offering us
to save our souls?

01:30:50.261 --> 01:30:52.263
You will sleep on the first floor.

01:30:53.431 --> 01:30:56.002
You're very lucky.
You'll have a room to yourself.

01:30:56.067 --> 01:30:58.308
It's a little room next to the chapel...

01:30:58.369 --> 01:31:01.543
that the Fathers and I
have been sprucing up for some time.

01:31:02.874 --> 01:31:04.512
What's your name?

01:31:06.844 --> 01:31:08.687
Sandokan.

01:31:10.848 --> 01:31:13.021
No, what's your real name?

01:31:15.853 --> 01:31:17.526
Sandokan.

01:31:20.591 --> 01:31:22.366
Thomas.

01:31:22.427 --> 01:31:25.237
Okay?
Thomas.

01:31:25.296 --> 01:31:26.969
- Thomas.
- Thomas.

01:31:30.568 --> 01:31:34.015
The first thing we have to do
is finish disinfecting him.

01:31:36.808 --> 01:31:41.757
I Wanted to tell you, Father,
if I’m gonna stay in this home...

01:31:41.813 --> 01:31:45.955
in order to maintain my mental balance
and not to go psycho...

01:31:46.017 --> 01:31:48.190
I need some drugs.

01:31:48.252 --> 01:31:53.133
For that, I need a supply
of phenobarbital...

01:31:53.191 --> 01:31:55.762
as well as alcohol,
propyphenazone, Rohypnol...

01:31:55.827 --> 01:31:58.671
Optalidon, Lipenan, aripiprazole,
phenobarbital...

01:31:58.729 --> 01:32:01.835
green, red and yellow
amphetamine capsules...

01:32:01.899 --> 01:32:05.142
Prodrin, Sirin, Ritalin, Cipropol...

01:32:05.203 --> 01:32:08.548
to get high, to relax, to stay level.

01:32:08.606 --> 01:32:12.918
And you can find all those things
in Dr. Hoffman's drugstore.

01:32:12.977 --> 01:32:14.979
He has the whole supply.

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:18.058
And another very important thing...

01:32:18.116 --> 01:32:22.462
is that, at any given time,
if suddenly, by accident...

01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:25.501
you have access to any of my pills...

01:32:25.556 --> 01:32:27.194
please, don't consume them.

01:32:27.258 --> 01:32:29.295
And if you do,
don't mix them with alcohol...

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:31.772
or you will be fucked.

01:32:32.430 --> 01:32:33.932
All of you.

01:32:36.367 --> 01:32:37.869
That's What I Wanted to say.

01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:59.491
<i>Lamb of God</i>

01:33:00.158 --> 01:33:06.370
<i>You take away the sins of the world</i>

01:33:08.199 --> 01:33:10.611
<i>Have mercy</i>

01:33:12.770 --> 01:33:15.979
<i>On us</i>

01:33:17.675 --> 01:33:21.418
<i>Lamb of God</i>

01:33:22.046 --> 01:33:25.493
<i>Lamb of God</i>

01:33:25.550 --> 01:33:27.496
May peace be upon you, Brothers.

01:33:27.552 --> 01:33:32.160
<i>You take away the sins of the world</i>

01:33:33.257 --> 01:33:37.000
<i>Have mercy</i>

01:33:37.061 --> 01:33:40.599
<i>On us</i>

01:33:41.232 --> 01:33:44.805
<i>Lamb of God</i>

01:33:45.303 --> 01:33:49.479
<i>Lamb of God</i>

01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:55.513
<i>You take away the sins of the world</i>

01:33:56.614 --> 01:34:00.118
<i>Grant us</i>

01:34:00.184 --> 01:34:03.688
<i>Peace</i>

01:34:03.754 --> 01:34:07.258
<i>Grant us</i>

01:34:07.325 --> 01:34:11.705
<i>Peace</i>

01:34:14.298 --> 01:34:19.748
<i>Lamb of God</i>

01:34:20.671 --> 01:34:27.919
<i>You take away the sins of the world</i>

01:34:28.579 --> 01:34:31.992
<i>Grant us</i>

01:34:32.817 --> 01:34:36.822
<i>Peace</i>

01:34:37.521 --> 01:34:42.436
<i>Grant us</i>

01:34:43.194 --> 01:34:48.507
<i>Peace</i>

01:34:49.305 --> 01:34:55.475
