♪ ♪

00:07.959 --> 00:09.542
(laughs):
Bye! Thank you!

00:09.625 --> 00:10.875
Of course we'll be back.

00:10.959 --> 00:12.333
Now, listen,
I don't want to make

00:12.417 --> 00:13.875
too much of an overstatement
here, but I think

00:13.959 --> 00:15.041
we're the smartest people
on the planet.

00:15.125 --> 00:16.250
I have not felt this smart since

00:16.333 --> 00:18.208
I cheated off
of Vijay Patel on the SATs.

00:18.291 --> 00:20.000
-Nice.
-I mean, look at all this cash

00:20.083 --> 00:22.041
we just made from returning
our wedding gifts.

00:22.125 --> 00:24.250
We didn't need any of that stuff
in the first place.

00:24.333 --> 00:25.583
I-I blame the scanning gun.

00:25.667 --> 00:27.083
I went, like, full Charlie's
Angels with that thing.

00:27.166 --> 00:28.458
Now, instead of having
a bunch of stuff,

00:28.542 --> 00:30.041
-we have a bunch of money.
-(both laugh)

00:30.125 --> 00:31.375
What do you want to do with it?

00:31.458 --> 00:33.041
I don't know.
Buy a bunch of stuff?

00:33.125 --> 00:34.583
Oh, God, you're so smart.

00:34.667 --> 00:36.125
Oh, God, you are such a genius.

00:36.208 --> 00:37.166
Come here, come here,
come here.

00:37.250 --> 00:38.375
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38.458 --> 00:40.458
(both moaning)

00:41.750 --> 00:44.041
This is great, Mom.

00:44.125 --> 00:45.125
The best.

00:45.208 --> 00:47.000
You two are so full of energy.

00:47.959 --> 00:49.125
Was it a sex morning?

00:49.208 --> 00:50.875
That always gives me
such a lift.

00:50.959 --> 00:52.375
Oh, well, thank you
for checking in,

00:52.458 --> 00:54.291
but, no, we're just
riding high on married life.

00:54.375 --> 00:55.750
-We love married life.
-Yeah.

00:55.834 --> 00:57.625
Speaking of your wedding,

00:57.709 --> 01:00.250
have you two enjoyed
your new waffle maker?

01:00.333 --> 01:01.834
Oh.

01:01.917 --> 01:03.500
The one we got
off your registry?

01:03.583 --> 01:06.667
Well, we haven't tried it yet,
but we are very excited.

01:06.750 --> 01:08.000
Yeah, we're just, you know,

01:08.083 --> 01:09.333
waiting for a special occasion

01:09.417 --> 01:10.792
to break that
Belgian bad boy open.

01:10.875 --> 01:12.250
How about tomorrow?

01:13.834 --> 01:15.458
We could have a waffle party.

01:15.542 --> 01:19.125
Yeah, it's like a sausage party
with less dudes.

01:19.208 --> 01:20.500
Sounds great. We're in.

01:20.583 --> 01:21.583
(chuckles, coughs)

01:21.667 --> 01:23.125
Great.

01:23.208 --> 01:28.083
You guys make the waffles
and the coffee and blueberries

01:28.166 --> 01:30.125
and whipped cream and syrup,

01:30.208 --> 01:32.583
and we'll just show up.

01:32.667 --> 01:33.875
-Yeah.
-Seems fair.

01:33.959 --> 01:35.500
Okay. Yeah.

01:36.917 --> 01:38.333
Come on, hurry up; they're
gonna be here any second.

01:38.417 --> 01:39.667
-Okay. W-W-Wait.
-What, what?

01:39.750 --> 01:41.125
We have to make it look like
we actually cooked these.

01:41.166 --> 01:43.000
Okay. Uh...

01:43.083 --> 01:46.709
Well, that's not helping,
and we don't have time.

01:46.792 --> 01:48.458
Oh, oh, oh, I can Sharpie
on grill marks.

01:48.542 --> 01:49.792
-(knocking)
-JOAN: We're here!

01:49.875 --> 01:51.250
Are you cursing us yet

01:51.333 --> 01:53.375
for all the work it takes
to host a brunch?

01:53.458 --> 01:55.041
(laughs)

01:55.125 --> 01:56.375
Whoa, something smells good.

01:56.458 --> 01:57.458
-Oh.
-Mmm.

01:57.542 --> 01:58.959
I think. I really haven't

01:59.041 --> 02:00.959
been able to smell
much since the '70s.

02:01.041 --> 02:02.417
COLLEEN:
Right.

02:02.500 --> 02:03.583
JOAN:
Oh, don't those look delicious.

02:03.667 --> 02:06.333
They're so fluffy,
like your hair.

02:06.417 --> 02:07.750
-Oh.
-(both laugh)

02:07.834 --> 02:09.542
How did you like
the waffle maker?

02:09.625 --> 02:11.583
It was great.

02:13.583 --> 02:15.333
And?

02:15.417 --> 02:18.625
Made waffles, as advertised.

02:18.709 --> 02:20.500
Nothing else you want to say?

02:20.583 --> 02:21.709
About what?

02:21.792 --> 02:23.291
About the cash.

02:23.375 --> 02:25.208
BOTH:
What cash?

02:25.291 --> 02:27.667
That was your real gift.

02:27.750 --> 02:30.333
We stuffed the box
with cash.

02:30.417 --> 02:31.959
JOHN:
A big wad of cash.

02:32.041 --> 02:34.000
Mom, we returned
that waffle maker.

02:34.083 --> 02:35.041
Mm-hmm.

02:35.125 --> 02:36.083
Why?

02:36.166 --> 02:37.542
For the cash.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.083
I told you we should've hid it

02:39.166 --> 02:41.083
in a tampon box;
nobody returns those.

02:41.166 --> 02:43.375
I'm not having
this discussion again.

02:43.458 --> 02:46.208
Why didn't you just give us cash
in a card like normal people?

02:46.291 --> 02:49.458
You probably would've returned
that, too, you cheap bastards.

02:49.542 --> 02:51.083
It's got to be here somewhere.

02:51.166 --> 02:53.542
It has a dent in it from
where I kicked it in disbelief

02:53.625 --> 02:56.291
that your parents gave us
such a cheap wedding present.

02:56.375 --> 02:58.625
Don't you dare bring up
my rage issues right now.

02:58.709 --> 03:01.083
I just don't understand.
We literally just returned it.

03:01.166 --> 03:03.083
Stop complaining, keep looking.

03:03.166 --> 03:04.333
Oh, now you have advice?

03:04.417 --> 03:05.959
After you returned everything
before opening it?

03:06.041 --> 03:08.083
Who knows how much cash could've
been in any of those things?

03:08.166 --> 03:09.625
My family does stupid stuff
like this all the time.

03:09.709 --> 03:10.959
Oh, don't get me started.

03:11.041 --> 03:12.500
I know all about
your dumb family.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.000
You know what?
You're right, we should just

03:14.083 --> 03:15.792
be happy with the presents
that your family gave us.

03:15.875 --> 03:17.750
Wait a minute, they didn't
give us any, unless of course

03:17.834 --> 03:19.250
you count your mother's
stupid shamanic blessing.

03:19.333 --> 03:20.709
We both cried.

03:20.792 --> 03:23.375
Keep opening boxes.

03:23.458 --> 03:27.125
Mmm. All this talk of waffles
got me in the mood.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.291
I didn't know we had
a waffle maker.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.834
Well, they were on sale when I
bought it for Matt and Colleen,

03:31.917 --> 03:32.959
so I got two.

03:33.041 --> 03:34.125
Oh!

03:34.208 --> 03:36.125
Uh-oh.

03:36.208 --> 03:37.625
No.

03:37.709 --> 03:39.333
I gave them the wrong box.

03:39.417 --> 03:40.625
We didn't do that.

03:40.709 --> 03:42.542
They're gonna get
a kick out of this.

03:42.625 --> 03:44.667
(both laughing)

03:49.667 --> 03:52.125
You can't open all those,
unless you plan on buying them.

03:52.208 --> 03:53.417
Well, fine, we'll buy them.

03:53.500 --> 03:54.875
-Yeah.
-We'll buy all of them.

03:54.959 --> 03:57.792
Yeah, in cash, once we find it.

04:02.709 --> 04:04.625
WOMAN:
<i>Reach up, inhale.</i>

04:04.709 --> 04:06.041
(breathes deeply)

04:06.125 --> 04:08.291
(groans):
Oh...

04:08.375 --> 04:10.208
Could you keep
your groaning down?

04:10.291 --> 04:11.792
I'm trying to mope here.

04:11.875 --> 04:13.709
I didn't even see you.
What are you doing here?

04:13.792 --> 04:15.625
Clementine has a date
at our house.

04:15.709 --> 04:16.792
-Oh.
-They said I could stay,

04:16.875 --> 04:18.333
but I found him
pretty pedestrian.

04:18.417 --> 04:20.500
So I snuck out
while they were in the shower.

04:20.583 --> 04:22.417
Oh, honey.

04:22.500 --> 04:25.166
Your living arrangement
is a bummer.

04:25.250 --> 04:27.208
Why don't you hang out
with your friends?

04:27.291 --> 04:28.291
No, now that they're in college,

04:28.375 --> 04:29.667
all they want
to talk about is partying.

04:29.750 --> 04:30.750
Oh, yeah.

04:30.834 --> 04:32.375
-It's so boring.
-Mm-hmm.

04:32.458 --> 04:33.583
They don't understand
the complexities

04:33.667 --> 04:35.000
of being a divorced homeowner.

04:35.083 --> 04:36.208
Mm, yeah.

04:36.291 --> 04:37.959
Well, who needs them?

04:38.041 --> 04:40.208
You know what?
I'll be your friend.

04:40.291 --> 04:41.375
And...

04:41.458 --> 04:43.500
I will make you a PB and J.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.750
Hmm? It's like
I'm your friend with benefits.

04:45.834 --> 04:48.375
You can't be friends
with your mom.

04:48.458 --> 04:50.000
Oh, come on, sure you can.

04:50.083 --> 04:52.583
We could just hang out
and watch Netflix and chill.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.417
You really don't get it.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.166
Okay, come on, Tyler,
give me a chance.

04:56.250 --> 04:57.542
Okay? I'm fun.

04:57.625 --> 04:59.542
Put your nice jeans on,
we'll go to the mall.

04:59.625 --> 05:02.834
Clementine is wearing
our nice jeans-- or was.

05:02.917 --> 05:06.250
Well, you clean up real nice,
pal.

05:06.333 --> 05:07.917
You know, friends
don't hit each other

05:08.000 --> 05:09.542
as much as you
think they do.

05:09.625 --> 05:11.417
Okay, fine.
I'm taking a mental note.

05:11.500 --> 05:14.667
-No hitting. No cleaning
your face with my spit.
-No.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.458
No asking
if you have to tinkle.

05:16.542 --> 05:18.834
That's a good start.
Ready to go home?

05:18.917 --> 05:20.333
(quietly):
Why? Do you have to tinkle?

05:20.417 --> 05:21.875
No.

05:21.959 --> 05:25.041
Good. 'Cause we have
the whole day together, huh?

05:25.125 --> 05:26.083
The whole day?

05:26.166 --> 05:27.792
Yeah, it's gonna be fun!

05:27.875 --> 05:28.917
Ow.

05:30.959 --> 05:34.458
Ooh! Fun hair stuff.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.125
Oh, Mom.

05:36.208 --> 05:38.792
Have you ever dreamt
of having straight hair?

05:38.875 --> 05:40.583
Oh, I have, yes.

05:40.667 --> 05:43.834
But, Tyler, have you ever
dreamt of having straight hair?

05:43.917 --> 05:47.000
Well, I mean, not this week,
but of course.

05:47.083 --> 05:49.417
This week, it's mostly been
nightmares about my divorce.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.917
When I get divorced,
nothing makes me feel better

05:52.000 --> 05:54.041
than long, straight, silky hair.

05:54.125 --> 05:55.125
Let me show you.

05:55.208 --> 05:56.709
Sorry, I would love to,

05:56.792 --> 05:58.834
but I'm actually saving up
for a new place.

05:58.917 --> 06:00.667
Oh, honey, come on, listen.

06:00.750 --> 06:03.834
If changing your look makes you
feel better, then this is on me.

06:03.917 --> 06:06.250
Okay-- Well, actually,
it's on whoever

06:06.333 --> 06:07.834
left their money in the ATM.

06:10.417 --> 06:12.709
Hey, you know what I think
we should do next?

06:12.792 --> 06:13.917
Dye your hair.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.458
I'm thinking not red.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.333
Maybe one glass at a time, Mom.

06:17.417 --> 06:19.083
Oh, honey.

06:19.166 --> 06:20.834
These are not both for me.

06:20.917 --> 06:22.250
-Wait, really?
-Yeah.

06:22.333 --> 06:23.792
But I'm not 21
for another two weeks.

06:23.875 --> 06:26.333
Well, that sounds like
a concern for a mom

06:26.417 --> 06:29.000
and not a friend with rad hair.

06:29.083 --> 06:30.792
-(chuckles): Thanks.
-BARTENDER: Here's that third

06:30.875 --> 06:32.208
glass of wine
you said you couldn't carry.

06:32.291 --> 06:33.458
-HEATHER: Thank you.
-There it is.

06:33.542 --> 06:35.792
-That goes right here.
-KIDDER: Tyler? Is that you?

06:35.875 --> 06:36.959
Nice hair, dude.

06:37.083 --> 06:38.959
You look like
a Sesame Street character.

06:39.041 --> 06:40.542
(both laugh)

06:40.625 --> 06:42.000
Hey, what are you laughing at,
Gabe?

06:42.083 --> 06:43.458
I know how long
you breast-fed for.

06:43.542 --> 06:45.250
Most kids don't do that
standing up.

06:45.333 --> 06:46.458
-Ooh.
-(Kidder laughs)

06:46.542 --> 06:48.166
We're gonna be late
to the movie,

06:48.250 --> 06:49.875
but it was great to see you,
man.

06:49.959 --> 06:51.583
-All right.
-Bye, Mrs. Hughes.

06:51.667 --> 06:54.750
You can totally go with
them if you want to.

06:54.834 --> 06:57.166
No, I'd much rather
hang out with you.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.125
-Really?
-Yeah.

06:59.208 --> 07:01.000
That's what friends are for,
right?

07:01.083 --> 07:02.500
-Oh, yay!
-(laughs)

07:02.583 --> 07:04.458
-All right, we're hitting again!
-Ow!

07:06.542 --> 07:08.834
So what's <i>Permission</i>
<i>Denied </i>about?

07:08.917 --> 07:11.041
I don't know,
but PositiveReviews.com

07:11.125 --> 07:12.208
calls it a winner.

07:12.291 --> 07:14.000
Oh. I love

07:14.083 --> 07:15.375

Okay, that's...

07:35.125 --> 07:36.083

07:36.166 --> 07:37.125

07:42.959 --> 07:44.500
I-I thought this was
about a train assassin.

07:44.542 --> 07:45.583
You know, if you don't
want to finish watching...

07:45.625 --> 07:47.667
No, no, no, honey,
I think this friendship

07:47.750 --> 07:50.875
-ends at a hard "R" rating.
-Yeah.

07:50.959 --> 07:53.375
-WOMAN: <i>Permission! (moaning)</i>
-Go, go, go!

07:57.458 --> 08:00.375
Are you sure you can handle Lark
for a whole night?

08:00.458 --> 08:02.834
Of course. It'll be like having

08:02.917 --> 08:05.208
a 30-pound bag of sugar
to nibble on all night.

08:05.291 --> 08:07.166
-(Jen chuckles)
-(Lark giggles)

08:07.250 --> 08:09.917
And this is the first night
you've been away from her

08:10.000 --> 08:11.500
since she was born.

08:11.583 --> 08:13.000
Yeah, but maybe it's too soon.

08:13.083 --> 08:14.667
-I don't know if we should do this.
-Oh, no, honey...

08:14.750 --> 08:16.250
What did I tell you about

08:16.333 --> 08:18.750
trusting your
maternal instincts?

08:18.834 --> 08:20.375
Don't do it.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.208
-Okay.
-Come here.

08:22.291 --> 08:26.083
Have a fun night with Mom-Mom,
okay? We love you.

08:26.166 --> 08:28.000
-Come on, let's go.
-Yeah, where are we going?

08:28.083 --> 08:29.834
We're gonna distract you
while your parents leave.

08:29.917 --> 08:31.875
-(exhales)
-Not yet.

08:32.875 --> 08:34.750
Not yet.

08:34.834 --> 08:36.417
Yet?

08:36.500 --> 08:38.000
-Not yet.
-Okay.

08:38.083 --> 08:39.041
Okay, now.

08:39.125 --> 08:40.750
(both whooping loudly)

08:40.834 --> 08:41.792
Yeah!

08:41.875 --> 08:43.166
-Yeah, baby!
-Yeah!

08:43.250 --> 08:44.250
We're free!

08:44.333 --> 08:45.458
Oh, babe,

08:45.542 --> 08:47.417
just like the good old days.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.458
Like when we had
nothing to argue about

08:49.542 --> 08:51.917
except which route to take
to avoid traffic.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.166
Oh, remember that? (scoffs)

08:53.250 --> 08:54.208
Yeah.

08:54.291 --> 08:55.875
(laughs)

08:55.959 --> 08:57.083
All right.

08:57.166 --> 08:58.500
You're gonna turn up here.

08:58.583 --> 08:59.542
What?

08:59.625 --> 09:00.959
-This is the turn.
-No, it's not.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.291
-It's the next one.
-Hmm?

09:02.375 --> 09:03.542
It's the next one.

09:03.625 --> 09:04.834
No, no. This is it.

09:04.917 --> 09:06.834
Jen, it's the ne...
Oh, shoot, you're right.

09:09.333 --> 09:11.041
(whoops)

09:11.125 --> 09:12.166
We made it.

09:12.250 --> 09:13.208
We did.

09:13.291 --> 09:14.250
-Hey.
-Mm-hmm.

09:14.333 --> 09:15.917
To us, and us only.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.083
Yes.

09:18.166 --> 09:19.458
In fact, drinking game.

09:19.542 --> 09:21.458
-Yeah.
-Every time we realize

09:21.542 --> 09:23.750
we don't have to take care
of a child, we drink.

09:23.834 --> 09:25.458
-Love it.
-Okay.

09:25.542 --> 09:27.917
So the porn channel's on the TV,
and we don't have to change it.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.750
-Drink.
-Mm-hmm.

09:29.834 --> 09:31.375
Mmm.

09:31.458 --> 09:32.750
There's a knife by the fruit.

09:32.834 --> 09:34.417
Yup.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.417
And now it's by
an electrical socket.

09:36.500 --> 09:37.709
Okay, drink twice.

09:37.792 --> 09:38.750
Wait, why twice?

09:38.834 --> 09:40.417
Uh, 'cause I like to party.

09:40.500 --> 09:41.458
Drink!

09:41.542 --> 09:44.291
(snoring)

09:44.375 --> 09:46.166
Drink. Drink.

09:46.250 --> 09:48.792
Babe?

09:48.875 --> 09:51.834
Hey, what time is it?

09:52.792 --> 09:54.041
Oh, Jen, wake up.

09:54.125 --> 09:55.083
We passed out drunk.

09:55.166 --> 09:56.166
It's 1:00 in the morning.

09:56.250 --> 09:57.542
-What?
-Wake up. We're sleeping through

09:57.625 --> 09:58.875
the best night of our lives.

09:58.959 --> 10:00.792
Oh, did we even have sex?

10:00.875 --> 10:02.333
I don't know, let me check.

10:04.333 --> 10:05.875
I guess not.

10:05.959 --> 10:07.375
This was for you.

10:07.458 --> 10:08.542
It was a surprise.

10:08.625 --> 10:11.291
Still kind of is a surprise.

10:11.375 --> 10:12.333
Yeah.

10:12.417 --> 10:13.709
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

10:13.792 --> 10:14.750
Excuse me, sir, sir, sir.

10:14.834 --> 10:17.250
Hi. Uh, Short party of two.

10:17.333 --> 10:19.583
I'm sorry, but we've been
closed for hours.

10:19.667 --> 10:22.417
Oh. Well, um,
what time do you open?

10:22.500 --> 10:23.875
A-Are we closer to that?

10:23.959 --> 10:26.000
Or-or could we
get room service?

10:26.083 --> 10:28.166
Oh, our room service
is excellent. You'll love it.

10:28.250 --> 10:29.458
Fantastic!

10:29.542 --> 10:31.125
But it doesn't start
till breakfast.

10:34.917 --> 10:37.750
Well, this isn't the worst thing
that I've taken

10:37.834 --> 10:40.291
off of a room service tray
someone left in the hall.

10:40.375 --> 10:43.583
Yeah, and much like
this coleslaw,

10:43.667 --> 10:46.375
this night is starting to turn.

10:46.458 --> 10:47.709
What?

10:47.792 --> 10:48.959
Hey.

10:49.041 --> 10:51.000
-Mommy's got a playlist.
-(smooth jazz playing)

10:51.083 --> 10:52.250
Wow, wow, wow.

10:52.333 --> 10:53.333
Mm-hmm.

10:53.417 --> 10:55.125
-Okay.
-Okay.

10:55.208 --> 10:57.667
I pick up what
you're laying down.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.041
-You like it?
-Yeah, I do.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.583
(baby crying)

11:01.667 --> 11:03.500
Do you hear that, too?

11:03.583 --> 11:05.583
Yeah, I hear it.

11:05.667 --> 11:07.792
But you want to know what?
Let's just ignore it.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.500
-Okay. Yeah.
-Let's ignore it. It's not our kid.

11:09.583 --> 11:11.333
-Mm-hmm. (clears throat) Okay.
-Here we go.

11:11.417 --> 11:12.417
(chuckles)

11:12.500 --> 11:13.500
-And we're back.
-Yeah.

11:13.583 --> 11:14.542
(baby continues crying)

11:14.625 --> 11:15.583
No, I can't.

11:15.667 --> 11:16.750
-No.
-Sorry. No, I can't.

11:16.834 --> 11:18.125
I-I can't be in the mood

11:18.208 --> 11:19.583
when there's a kid crying.

11:19.667 --> 11:22.166
Greg, the whole point of this
was to get away

11:22.250 --> 11:25.750
from being parents,
to get back into being a couple.

11:25.834 --> 11:27.583
You're right.
You want to know what?

11:27.667 --> 11:30.041
I'm gonna go be
the childless jerk

11:30.125 --> 11:32.333
who goes over there
and tells them to

11:32.417 --> 11:33.959
"Keep it down!"

11:34.041 --> 11:36.917
(baby continues crying)

11:37.000 --> 11:38.041
(sniffs)

11:40.792 --> 11:42.375
(whispers):
Ow.

11:44.458 --> 11:45.959
Hey.

11:46.041 --> 11:47.959
Hey. There something
we can do about this noise?

11:48.041 --> 11:49.917
Because I'm trying
to get drunk with my wife.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.709
No, I'm-I'm really sorry.
I know my little one's

11:51.792 --> 11:53.709
making a lot of noise.
She has an ear infection,

11:53.792 --> 11:55.542
and-and I'm trying to get her
to the hospital.

11:55.625 --> 11:56.917
-Oh. Okay.
-Yeah.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.291
Well, if you're going
to the hospital,

11:58.375 --> 11:59.458
I guess that solves
the noise problem.

11:59.542 --> 12:00.500
Good luck.

12:00.583 --> 12:02.041
Uh, but-but, you know,
I-I actually

12:02.125 --> 12:03.542
don't know what to do
with my three-year-old.

12:03.625 --> 12:04.834
She's terrified of hospitals.

12:04.917 --> 12:06.542
Yeah, well, we're all
terrified of something.

12:06.625 --> 12:07.875
For me, it's Pat Sajak.

12:07.959 --> 12:09.917
I don't want to go
to a hospital.

12:11.083 --> 12:13.083
That where Daddy died.

12:13.166 --> 12:16.417
Oh, dude.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.166
(sighs)

12:18.250 --> 12:19.375
GREG:
Hey, honey.

12:19.458 --> 12:21.417
Good news, bad news.

12:21.500 --> 12:25.375
Good news is I got
the crying to stop.

12:26.542 --> 12:28.417
Do you want to guess
what the bad news is?

12:30.458 --> 12:32.375
Greg, who's this?

12:32.458 --> 12:34.667
This is Lucia.

12:34.750 --> 12:38.083
Who is going to be staying
with us until her mom gets back.

12:38.166 --> 12:40.500
This sounds like a super fun way
for the two of us

12:40.583 --> 12:43.625
to spend our one night alone,
just the two of us.

12:43.709 --> 12:45.667
Okay. Hi, Lucia.

12:45.750 --> 12:47.500
(clears throat) Uh...

12:47.583 --> 12:50.208
I'm gonna go change
out of my special jammies,

12:50.291 --> 12:53.750
and then we're gonna get you
settled down to sleep.

12:53.834 --> 12:56.417
I sleep during the day.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.583
Course you do.

12:59.667 --> 13:03.500
Okay, Lucia, remember,
you promised me you were gonna

13:03.583 --> 13:06.041
stop jumping and lay down
and-and close your eyes.

13:06.125 --> 13:07.083
What happened?

13:07.166 --> 13:08.417
I lied.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.458
-You lied.
-Yeah.

13:09.542 --> 13:11.875
Ugh, why are you jumping
on the bed?

13:11.959 --> 13:13.417
Because it's fun.

13:15.709 --> 13:18.834
Oh, all right.

13:18.917 --> 13:21.166
Let's have some fun.

13:21.250 --> 13:23.375
Oh, okay.

13:23.458 --> 13:25.417
(sighs)

13:25.500 --> 13:28.000
At least the bed's
getting some kind of action.

13:28.083 --> 13:29.041
Yeah.

13:29.125 --> 13:30.333
Freestyle!

13:30.417 --> 13:31.959
-(groans): Oh!
-Uh-oh.

13:32.041 --> 13:34.291
This is how you play
Ding Dong Ditch.

13:34.375 --> 13:37.417
(quietly):
All right, ready?

13:37.500 --> 13:39.917
One, two, three, go.
Quick, go!

13:40.000 --> 13:42.166
Go, go, go, go, go.
In there, in there, in there.

13:42.250 --> 13:43.208
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Yeah!

13:43.291 --> 13:44.250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:44.333 --> 13:46.542
-Hey.
-Hmm?

13:46.625 --> 13:49.834
Remember when you said you
always wanted to do a three-way?

13:49.917 --> 13:52.667
Uh, that was you, but go on.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.750
Well, this isn't it.

13:58.291 --> 14:00.041
(sighs)

14:00.125 --> 14:03.125
Oh, they're so cute
when they're sleeping.

14:07.208 --> 14:08.959
(sighs):
Oh, man.

14:09.041 --> 14:11.041
Well, that was just like
staying home with Lark,

14:11.125 --> 14:13.583
except it cost us $400.

14:13.667 --> 14:15.750
You think we'll ever
get back to being who we were

14:15.834 --> 14:17.291
before we had kids?

14:17.375 --> 14:19.875
Yeah, but we'll be
too old to enjoy it.

14:19.959 --> 14:21.792
You know what, though?

14:21.875 --> 14:25.000
We may suck at being
carefree and childless,

14:25.083 --> 14:27.041
but we are good
at being parents.

14:29.667 --> 14:30.750
All right, don't worry, Lucia,

14:30.834 --> 14:32.083
we're gonna find your mommy,
okay?

14:32.166 --> 14:34.000
She's got to be at one
of these hospitals.

14:34.083 --> 14:36.458
-(phone beeps)
-Oh, Amber Alert.

14:36.542 --> 14:40.000
Greg, what is
your license plate number?

14:40.083 --> 14:43.417
Huh?

14:43.500 --> 14:45.208
Oh, no.

14:45.291 --> 14:46.458
Oh, no.

14:50.959 --> 14:53.166
(TV playing quietly,
Samantha laughs)

14:53.250 --> 14:55.291
Yeah, I heard Mr. Henkels
is living in his car.

14:55.375 --> 14:57.208
Yeah, Mrs. Henkels
kicked him out

14:57.291 --> 14:59.041
because he gambled away
the Relay For Life money.

14:59.125 --> 15:00.208
(both laugh)

15:00.291 --> 15:01.542
Hey, Sam.
Who's your new friend?

15:01.625 --> 15:04.333
Uh, Ryan, this is my
dad and my grandfather,

15:04.417 --> 15:05.500
and you know Sophia.

15:05.583 --> 15:06.542
Hi.

15:06.625 --> 15:07.709
You guys want to join us?

15:07.792 --> 15:09.583
We're watching some dumb crap

15:09.667 --> 15:12.709
that John picked because
apparently it's his damn house,

15:12.792 --> 15:14.500
and he gets to choose
what we watch.

15:14.583 --> 15:16.875
No, we're going to go study.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.291
Ah, very good.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.917
Education, that's what
separates us from the apes.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.208
(Tim chuckles)

15:22.291 --> 15:24.625
Though they don't wear pants,
so...

15:24.709 --> 15:26.458
maybe they know
something we don't.

15:26.542 --> 15:28.458
Well, it was nice
meeting you all.

15:28.542 --> 15:29.959
TIM:
Mm.

15:30.041 --> 15:32.667
You're just gonna let her
waltz up there with that man?

15:32.750 --> 15:34.542
I mean, he looks older
than I do.

15:34.625 --> 15:36.125
Eh, it's the hormones
in the chicken.

15:36.208 --> 15:38.125
All 14-year-olds
look like that now.

15:38.208 --> 15:40.333
He's actually
the senior class president,

15:40.417 --> 15:42.291
and he used to date
Gina Tortellini.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.875
How do you know all that?

15:43.959 --> 15:45.583
I ask questions.

15:45.667 --> 15:48.375
Is that the Tortellini girl
that had the twins?

15:48.458 --> 15:49.625
Yup.

15:49.709 --> 15:50.959
How do you know all that?

15:51.041 --> 15:53.000
Oh, I ask questions.

15:53.083 --> 15:56.125
Ah, he seems like a nice
enough study partner.

15:56.208 --> 15:57.333
Hmm?

15:57.417 --> 15:58.834
That dude's only going upstairs

15:58.917 --> 16:00.458
to study
your daughter's downstairs.

16:00.542 --> 16:01.709
John!

16:01.792 --> 16:03.583
Sam is a good girl,
and if she says

16:03.667 --> 16:05.959
she's going upstairs to study,
then that's what she's doing.

16:06.041 --> 16:08.834
(chuckles):
Yeah, studying his wanger bar.

16:10.291 --> 16:11.709
Hit me with another one.

16:11.792 --> 16:13.542
If I tell Sam she can't
have a boy in her room,

16:13.625 --> 16:14.917
then she's just gonna
want it even more,

16:15.000 --> 16:16.417
and I'm not gonna be
that kind of dad.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.083
So, I'm gonna let
them study in peace.

16:19.166 --> 16:21.542
Oy, study his piece.

16:21.625 --> 16:23.917
(chuckles)

16:24.000 --> 16:25.917
(sportscast playing over TV)

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
(Samantha and Ryan
laughing upstairs)

16:31.125 --> 16:32.917
Lot of giggling up there.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.625
Not worried about it, John.

16:34.709 --> 16:37.000
They were giggling when
they came in. They're funny.

16:37.083 --> 16:40.083
Besides, I'll take giggling
over silence any day.

16:42.875 --> 16:44.834
It's awful quiet up there.

16:44.917 --> 16:46.834
No, John, that's what happens
when you giggle too long,

16:46.917 --> 16:49.041
then you need to take a little
break, catch your breath,

16:49.125 --> 16:51.625
so you can...
start giggling again.

16:51.709 --> 16:53.083
Here, I'll tickle you.

16:53.166 --> 16:54.709
Don't touch me.

16:58.291 --> 17:00.166
See? Now we're quiet.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.625
Uh-huh.

17:01.709 --> 17:03.834
-(sighs)
-Where you going?

17:03.917 --> 17:06.750
I left my curling iron on.

17:06.834 --> 17:08.208
Idiot.

17:08.291 --> 17:11.083
All right, look,
I need you to sneak in there,

17:11.166 --> 17:14.000
just super casual,
drop off the snacks,

17:14.083 --> 17:16.500
and then look for signs of...

17:16.583 --> 17:19.709
Wh-What is it you think
boys and girls do again?

17:19.792 --> 17:21.166
Hug?

17:21.250 --> 17:22.667
Right.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.875
Look for signs of hugging.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.875
Hey, you ever notice all these
pictures are of Sam and Matt?

17:32.959 --> 17:34.792
You nervous about something?

17:34.875 --> 17:36.417
Nope. Just waiting for Sophia.

17:36.500 --> 17:37.959
She's upstairs...

17:38.959 --> 17:40.500
...unplugging the curling iron.

17:40.583 --> 17:43.792
Really? Because she just left
with Joanie for the store.

17:43.875 --> 17:45.166
What?

17:45.250 --> 17:46.542
Damn it.

17:46.625 --> 17:48.041
She's a double agent.

17:59.792 --> 18:01.917
-(alarm beeping)
-Oh, geez.

18:04.458 --> 18:05.709
Dad, what are you doing?

18:05.792 --> 18:07.750
Hey, guys. I was, uh...

18:07.834 --> 18:09.291
-just testing this.
-(alarm stops)

18:09.375 --> 18:10.667
(chuckles)

18:10.750 --> 18:12.375
Your mom would get pretty upset
with me

18:12.458 --> 18:13.959
if I burned
another house down, right?

18:14.041 --> 18:15.125
(laughs) But it works, so...

18:15.208 --> 18:16.166
(alarm beeping)

18:16.250 --> 18:18.375
(Samantha and Ryan groan)

18:18.458 --> 18:19.834
(alarm stops)

18:19.917 --> 18:21.792
What are you guys doing
in there?

18:21.875 --> 18:24.417
Uh, we're just running lines
to audition for the play.

18:24.500 --> 18:26.542
Oh, an actor, huh?

18:26.625 --> 18:28.500
Oh, I do a little acting, too.

18:28.583 --> 18:30.250
Sometimes I'm a real nice guy,

18:30.333 --> 18:32.959
and sometimes
I can be real mean.

18:34.208 --> 18:35.750
I'm just kidding.
See, I was just doing it.

18:35.834 --> 18:37.709
Acting, very simple. Right?

18:37.792 --> 18:39.333
Yeah. (chuckles)

18:39.417 --> 18:40.875
Dad.

18:40.959 --> 18:42.417
Guys, come on,
we're having a moment!

18:42.500 --> 18:43.583
(door closes)

18:47.000 --> 18:48.792
How are things going upstairs?

18:48.875 --> 18:50.500
Am I a great-grandfather yet?

18:50.583 --> 18:52.458
No, because they're not
doing anything wrong.

18:52.542 --> 18:54.625
Samantha's a good kid,
and I trust her.

18:54.709 --> 18:56.041
Ah, I think you may be right.

18:56.125 --> 18:58.875
I was just thinking,
back when I was a teenage boy,

18:58.959 --> 19:02.417
I used to tell the moms that
we were practicing for a play.

19:02.500 --> 19:05.792
I was the cat
and she was the hot tin roof.

19:05.875 --> 19:07.208
But I can't speak for all men.

19:07.291 --> 19:10.333
Y-You were probably different
back in that age.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.083
"Diddler on the Roof"
was another one.

19:12.166 --> 19:13.875
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

19:13.959 --> 19:15.500
Sam!

19:15.583 --> 19:17.083
(chuckles)

19:21.417 --> 19:22.792
(gasps) Dad!

19:22.875 --> 19:23.834
Oops, sorry.

19:23.917 --> 19:24.875
Wrong house, uh, room.

19:24.959 --> 19:26.417
(chuckles)

19:26.500 --> 19:28.667
Sophia! Why did you tell me
to come up here?!

19:28.750 --> 19:29.834
Sorry.

19:29.917 --> 19:30.875
What?

19:30.959 --> 19:31.959
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

19:32.041 --> 19:33.625
I can't believe this.

19:33.709 --> 19:35.458
You barged in there
because you don't trust me.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.041
What do you think
we were doing in there?

19:37.125 --> 19:40.083
I don't know. Your Pop-Pop was
saying all kinds of weird stuff.

19:40.166 --> 19:41.750
Samantha!

19:41.834 --> 19:43.625
(door closes)

19:43.709 --> 19:45.792
They're not doing anything,
just like I said.

19:45.875 --> 19:47.375
So, congratulations on making me

19:47.458 --> 19:49.417
the kind of parent
I didn't want to be.

19:49.500 --> 19:50.709
Well, we all end up being

19:50.792 --> 19:52.333
the kind of parent
we don't want to be.

19:52.417 --> 19:53.667
That's what being a parent is.

19:53.750 --> 19:54.875
No, I don't buy it.

19:54.959 --> 19:56.583
I'm done acting like you.

19:57.709 --> 19:59.125
I'm gonna go act like me.

20:03.333 --> 20:05.834
(sighs)

20:05.917 --> 20:07.542
Yeah?

20:07.625 --> 20:09.542
I owe you an apology.

20:09.625 --> 20:12.250
I'm listening.

20:12.333 --> 20:14.250
I stopped trusting you,

20:14.333 --> 20:16.583
and I promised myself
that I would never do that.

20:16.667 --> 20:18.709
So, won't happen again.

20:18.792 --> 20:20.166
I'm sorry.

20:20.250 --> 20:22.125
Thanks, Dad.

20:22.208 --> 20:24.208
Yeah, come on.

20:31.542 --> 20:33.750
I don't think he's going
to be back for a while.

20:33.834 --> 20:35.500
