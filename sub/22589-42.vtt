00:11.638 --> 00:15.683
<i>NARRATOR".
An apparently peaceful day in Gotham City.</i>

00:15.850 --> 00:17.977
<i>But what is this?</i>

00:18.144 --> 00:21.981
<i>An armored-car holdup in broad daylight?</i>

00:22.148 --> 00:24.025
Bash those guards.

00:24.192 --> 00:25.652
Heist that cash.

00:25.985 --> 00:29.531
Use your guns.
I wanna hear some noise. Quack.

00:34.369 --> 00:37.664
We're going to be late for that lecture
to the Crime Prevention League.

00:37.830 --> 00:40.416
Sounds like we may pick up
new material for the lecture.

00:40.583 --> 00:44.587
There's nothing like a little on-the-job research,
old chum.

00:47.298 --> 00:51.177
Lift that loot and tote that cash. Get the loot.

00:51.386 --> 00:54.889
Hurry up. You're supposed to be crooks,
not a bunch of old women.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:05.066 --> 01:06.943
What are you buttinskies doing here?

01:07.110 --> 01:10.154
Just a little scholarly research, Penguin.

01:12.073 --> 01:15.243
Stop. Stop this outrageous intrusion.

01:22.375 --> 01:24.752
Cease, I say. Cease and desist.

01:27.338 --> 01:29.340
Stop, you bumbling buffoons.

01:29.507 --> 01:31.426
This is legal, I tell you. It's legal.

01:31.593 --> 01:34.554
Have you heard anything
about legalized thievery, Robin?

01:34.721 --> 01:36.306
Can't say that I have, Batman.

01:36.472 --> 01:39.517
I'll wipe those silly smirks
off your faces in court.

01:39.684 --> 01:43.396
I'll sue you for assault and battery
and aggravated interference.

01:44.105 --> 01:49.569
Tsk. You're witnessing the final disintegration
of a criminal brain, Robin.

01:49.986 --> 01:52.947
Years of outlawry have taken
their inevitable toll.

01:53.531 --> 01:55.783
But he's right
about our being in court, Batman.

01:56.159 --> 02:00.538
We'll be the prosecution's star witnesses
when they try you for armed robbery.

02:02.332 --> 02:04.167
Mother machree. What's happening?

02:04.334 --> 02:07.086
Nothing now, chief.
Lucky we happened to be passing by.

02:07.253 --> 02:10.590
Oh, no, Batman, 'twasn't luck.
'Twas a tragedy.

02:10.757 --> 02:13.009
Do your duty, O'Hara.
Slap the handcuffs on them.

02:13.176 --> 02:15.595
They've attacked these innocent citizens.

02:15.762 --> 02:18.222
Innocent citizens?

02:18.848 --> 02:20.183
What's going on here, chief?

02:20.350 --> 02:23.394
I'm afraid he's right, Batman. Look around.

02:27.315 --> 02:30.568
Holy CinemaScope.
Penguin making pictures?

02:32.612 --> 02:34.113
That robbery was just a mock-up.

02:34.280 --> 02:37.158
But this permit isn't a mock-up,
Boy Blunderhead.

02:37.325 --> 02:41.746
It's signed and sealed by
the Gotham City Motion Picture Commission.

02:41.913 --> 02:47.502
And I'm gonna sue the city for $10 million
for failure to provide proper protection.

02:47.669 --> 02:51.255
Do you hear that, Batman?
Ten million dollars.

02:51.422 --> 02:52.507
I hear you, Penguin.

02:52.674 --> 02:56.427
And you two are going to jail
for aggravated assault...

02:56.594 --> 02:58.471
...and malicious property damage.

02:58.638 --> 03:00.431
Do you hear that, Batman?

03:00.598 --> 03:01.683
Jail.

03:01.849 --> 03:05.144
- Looks like he's got us this time, Robin.
-Like rats in a trap.

03:07.730 --> 03:10.191
But I'm willing to make a deal.

04:26.726 --> 04:31.397
But, Batman, this is a contract for you
and Robin to act in Penguin's picture.

04:31.564 --> 04:32.607
And you've signed it.

04:32.774 --> 04:36.736
Aw, it was blackmail, commissioner.
That bird trapped them into it.

04:36.903 --> 04:39.614
- Not exactly, chief.
-What do you mean, Batman?

04:39.781 --> 04:42.241
I wanted to sign that contract, Robin.

04:42.408 --> 04:44.368
You knew that robbery was a fake
from the start?

04:44.535 --> 04:47.163
Yes, I saw the movie equipment
as we drove up.

04:47.330 --> 04:49.832
I didn't have time to explain...

04:49.999 --> 04:52.919
...but I wanted Penguin to think
that he'd trapped us.

04:53.085 --> 04:54.295
Why, Batman?

04:54.462 --> 04:57.340
When someone like Penguin
sets up a movie company...

04:57.507 --> 05:00.802
...you can be sure it's not only film he's after,
commissioner.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.763
- Sure and that's the truth.
-So you signed that contract...

05:03.930 --> 05:06.766
...so we could keep an eye on Penguin.
-Precisely, Robin.

05:06.933 --> 05:11.312
It's the only way we can stay close to him
without arousing his suspicion.

05:11.479 --> 05:14.106
What do you think the Penguin's planning,
Batman?

05:14.273 --> 05:16.651
That's what we'll try to find out,
commissioner.

05:16.818 --> 05:20.822
He's gone to a lot of expense
to establish this film company...

05:20.988 --> 05:25.284
...so we can be sure it's something big.

05:35.211 --> 05:37.171
Where is Marsha, Queen of Diamonds?

05:37.338 --> 05:39.924
She is two hours late, Miss Patterson.

05:40.091 --> 05:42.093
We're trying to locate her, Mr. Penguin.

05:42.260 --> 05:45.263
Well, try harder.
Time is money in the movie business.

05:45.429 --> 05:47.765
- Yes, Mr. Penguin.
- Quack.

05:50.268 --> 05:51.435
Prop Department?

05:51.602 --> 05:54.355
<i>No, Mr. Penguin. This is the Set Department.</i>

05:54.522 --> 05:56.524
Eh. Prop Department?

05:56.691 --> 05:59.735
<i>Sorry, Mr. Penguin. This is Publicity.</i>

05:59.902 --> 06:02.029
Prop Department?

06:03.614 --> 06:05.533
Prop Department?

06:07.034 --> 06:10.204
- Prop Department?
- Yes, Mr. Penguin.

06:10.371 --> 06:12.331
Forgot what I wanted you for.

06:12.498 --> 06:16.210
Oh, yes. Have you ordered that milk
for scene 12 tomorrow?

06:16.377 --> 06:18.504
<i>Yes, sir. The tank trucks are arriving now.</i>

06:18.671 --> 06:20.298
<i>Twenty-four thousand gallons.</i>

06:20.464 --> 06:22.717
Heh. Good, good, good.

06:22.884 --> 06:24.510
Mr. Penguin?

06:24.677 --> 06:25.887
Yes, Miss Patterson.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.889
<i>PATTERSON".
Marsha, Queen of Diamonds, is here.</i>

06:28.055 --> 06:29.891
Send her in, send her in.

06:33.060 --> 06:36.522
Oh, I see that you're at your glittering best,
my dear.

06:36.689 --> 06:38.482
Thank you, darling.

06:38.649 --> 06:43.112
Now, how do you suggest I get across
this football field you call an office?

06:43.613 --> 06:46.616
Ah, well, just hop into my Pengy-mobile
and ride over.

06:48.117 --> 06:49.452
Ah.

06:58.377 --> 07:00.546
Oh, my!

07:00.713 --> 07:05.676
Why, you're even more ravishing than usual,
Martha my darling.

07:05.843 --> 07:07.929
Skip the compliments, darling.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.932
You wouldn't have asked me here
if you didn't want something.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.516
Yes, I do want something.

07:12.683 --> 07:15.269
I want to make you a millionairess.

07:15.436 --> 07:17.688
How boring. I'm already a millionairess.

07:17.855 --> 07:22.318
Heh, it's true. Then how would you like
to be a billionairess?

07:22.485 --> 07:25.237
- That's interesting.
-And all you have to do...

07:25.404 --> 07:29.033
...is to become my partner
in this motion-picture company.

07:29.200 --> 07:34.163
Oh, come, now, Pengy. You don't really think
there's a billion dollars in filmmaking.

07:34.330 --> 07:37.166
Faugh, this motion-picture company
is just a front.

07:37.333 --> 07:38.417
- A front?
-That's right.

07:38.584 --> 07:40.795
A front? For what? For what?

07:40.962 --> 07:44.215
For the biggest caper ever to be pulled
in Gotham City.

07:44.382 --> 07:47.635
But I need capital,
because this is a very expensive front.

07:47.802 --> 07:50.513
- How much capital?
-Mm, as much as we can get.

07:50.680 --> 07:55.059
About a dozen of those diamonds
that you're wearing as a start.

07:55.226 --> 08:00.064
And for a dozen of my diamonds,
I will be the star of your film, of course.

08:00.231 --> 08:04.151
Well, I was thinking of somebody with more--
With more "waah."

08:04.318 --> 08:08.948
If you're thinking of my diamonds, darling,
you were thinking of me for the star.

08:09.115 --> 08:12.827
The star of my film is Batman. Heh!

08:12.994 --> 08:14.495
- Batman? Batman?
-Yes.

08:14.662 --> 08:19.208
- How did you get him?
-Oh, well, my usual bit of cunning chicanery.

08:19.375 --> 08:21.168
Along with the Boy Wonder.

08:21.335 --> 08:22.878
How's that for a cool one?

08:23.045 --> 08:25.131
- Very clever.
-Mm?

08:25.297 --> 08:27.800
- Pengy, darling.
-Yeah?

08:27.967 --> 08:31.887
Does Batman have a love scene
with the leading lady in your film?

08:32.054 --> 08:35.850
Why, of course.
Who ever heard of a film without a love scene?

08:36.017 --> 08:38.894
Then I shall be your leading lady.

08:39.061 --> 08:40.354
Or no diamonds.

08:40.520 --> 08:44.859
I might even be able to get my aunt Hilda
to whip up a love potion for my lipstick.

08:45.026 --> 08:46.986
Your aunt Hilda? Heh!

08:47.153 --> 08:49.947
Is that old witch still practicing
her black magic?

08:50.114 --> 08:51.699
The blackest, darling.

08:51.866 --> 08:55.995
And with her help,
I'll finally get Batman in my power.

08:56.162 --> 08:58.664
Well, that's an additional bit of chicanery.
All right.

08:58.831 --> 09:00.291
- Is it a deal?
-it's a deal.

09:00.458 --> 09:03.502
Ah, good. I wouldn't mind winning an Oscar.

09:03.669 --> 09:05.838
Heh, an Oscar? Heh!

09:06.005 --> 09:07.423
You don't want one of those.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.425
My dear, if you play along with me...

09:09.592 --> 09:14.138
...you are liable to win the most coveted award
in the entire motion-picture business.

09:14.305 --> 09:16.766
You are liable to win...

09:16.932 --> 09:18.976
...a Penguin.

09:20.561 --> 09:23.606
Penguin's script looks innocent enough,
Robin.

09:23.773 --> 09:27.818
An historical spectacle
set in the days of ancient Rome.

09:27.985 --> 09:29.570
But holy miscasts, Batman.

09:29.737 --> 09:33.908
We play a pair of barbarian bandits sentenced
to fight as gladiators in the Coliseum.

09:34.075 --> 09:38.287
Casting us as bandits would appeal
to Penguin's warped sense of humor.

09:38.454 --> 09:41.082
He's sure gonna want us
jumping through hoops, Batman.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.709
And I'm afraid we'll have to jump, Robin.

09:43.876 --> 09:47.171
At least until we find out what he's up to.

09:48.297 --> 09:52.134
But we don't have to make things
easy for him.

09:52.301 --> 09:56.222
Take a look at scene 12, on Page 33.

10:00.601 --> 10:03.646
Gosh, Batman. What a scene.

10:03.813 --> 10:06.982
I think someone connected
with the Gotham City Film Decency League...

10:07.149 --> 10:10.027
...should take a look at this script.
What do you think, Robin?

10:12.071 --> 10:13.614
What do you think, Robin?

10:13.781 --> 10:17.076
Oh. I think Penguin's gonna be
in very hot water, Batman.

10:17.243 --> 10:18.410
That's what I think.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.671
This must be it, Robin.

10:47.356 --> 10:51.819
- Holy movie moguls, Batman.
-Penguin's certainly playing his part to the hilt.

10:55.156 --> 10:57.950
Well, if it isn't my two ham actors.

10:58.117 --> 10:59.994
The only ham here is wearing a top hat.

11:00.161 --> 11:03.789
Tut-tut, Boy Bungler,
we can't all be great artists.

11:09.003 --> 11:10.671
There it is.

11:10.838 --> 11:15.301
An exact duplicate of the famous
Tyrrhenian baths in ancient Rome.

11:15.467 --> 11:17.219
This is for scene 12, I take it.

11:17.386 --> 11:20.890
- You like that scene, eh, Batman?
-I think it's in very poor taste, Penguin.

11:21.056 --> 11:24.310
Faugh, it's a fantastically magnificent scene.

11:24.476 --> 11:26.687
- I wrote it myself.
-Obviously.

11:28.063 --> 11:30.399
What's the reason for the blindfolds,
Batman?

11:30.566 --> 11:34.862
The reason is arriving now, Boy Bromide.

11:40.409 --> 11:41.952
Hello, darling.

11:42.119 --> 11:47.374
Oh, this'll be the most startling spectacle ever
to hit the screen. Ha, ha.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.256
Wardrobe, where is Miss Marsha's,
heh, costume? Heh, heh.

11:54.423 --> 11:56.800
Ah, there it is. Very good.

11:56.967 --> 12:00.638
Ah! Perfect, perfect. Thank you, thank you.

12:02.973 --> 12:06.560
Are you ready to make history
with this milk bath, my dear?

12:06.727 --> 12:09.813
Ready whenever you are, C.B.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.191
The love potion in my lipstick is ready too.

12:15.277 --> 12:19.073
Oh. Batman and Robin, how nice to see you.

12:19.240 --> 12:21.283
You too, Mrs. Cooper.

12:21.450 --> 12:25.496
Could you point out someone called
Mr. Penguin to me'?

12:26.205 --> 12:28.332
I am Mr. Penguin, madam.

12:28.499 --> 12:33.379
And I am Mrs. Harriet Cooper
of the Gotham City League of Film Decency.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.465
Film Decency?

12:36.632 --> 12:38.217
What are you doing here, Mrs. C?

12:38.384 --> 12:40.719
We have read your script, Mr. Penguin.

12:40.886 --> 12:45.933
And we cannot approve the scene
which you apparently are about to shoot.

12:46.100 --> 12:47.810
This is outrageous.

12:47.977 --> 12:50.062
As the leading entrepreneur
of Gotham City...

12:50.229 --> 12:54.858
...I will not submit to having
one page of my masterpiece enfeebled.

12:55.025 --> 12:59.321
And we will not submit
to such bullying tones.

12:59.488 --> 13:03.784
Kindly remove your Victorian mind
from my set, Mrs. C.

13:03.951 --> 13:08.706
Only when you remove this morbid scene
from your film.

13:08.872 --> 13:10.499
Think of the children.

13:10.666 --> 13:12.710
I am thinking of the children, madam.

13:12.876 --> 13:14.920
Look at this. Look at this here.

13:15.087 --> 13:19.174
Twenty-three thousand quarts
of homogenized milk here.

13:19.341 --> 13:21.593
Fortified with vitamin C.

13:21.760 --> 13:26.515
I tell you, this whole scene is bursting
with minerals and vitamins.

13:26.682 --> 13:30.436
This scene is bursting
with other things as well.

13:30.644 --> 13:34.231
Oh, you know, I suspect this is your doing,
masked meddlers.

13:34.398 --> 13:37.985
You're always poking your proboscis
into other people's business.

13:38.152 --> 13:40.487
Decency is everybody's business, Penguin.

13:40.654 --> 13:43.282
All right. All right, we will out the scene.

13:43.449 --> 13:47.077
And instead, we will do scene 43.

13:47.244 --> 13:48.746
Get ready, Marsha.

13:48.912 --> 13:52.958
And you, Batman,
take your place for scene 43.

13:55.711 --> 13:57.880
Scene 43,
that's the one where you and Marsha--

13:58.047 --> 13:59.965
Yes, I know, Robin.

14:00.132 --> 14:02.468
But I'll have to do it.

14:11.810 --> 14:15.814
I trust you're going to enjoy this scene,
Batman, darling.

14:15.981 --> 14:18.942
I made a bargain with Penguin,
and I never break my word.

14:19.109 --> 14:20.361
Bargain?

14:20.527 --> 14:25.366
Why, half the men in the world would fight
to be kissed by Marsha, Queen of Diamonds.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.659
They certainly wouldn't have to fight me.

14:27.826 --> 14:30.746
What an appalling lack of enthusiasm,
darling.

14:30.913 --> 14:35.167
But don't worry,
I have enough enthusiasm for both of us.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.544
Lights.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.797
Camera.

14:40.172 --> 14:42.091
Action.

14:48.097 --> 14:50.849
Cut it. That's not good enough.

14:51.016 --> 14:54.186
Batman, I want you
to put some "grah" into it.

14:54.353 --> 14:56.522
We'll do it again and again and again.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.524
Once is enough, you feathered fraud.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.276
Tut-tut, Boy Bluenose.

15:01.443 --> 15:05.197
Penguin is a perfectionist.
I'll do it a hundred times if it's necessary.

15:05.614 --> 15:07.866
And it will be necessary.

15:08.033 --> 15:09.118
All right, action.

15:15.332 --> 15:19.461
Oh, Bruce, your lips are terribly chapped.

15:19.628 --> 15:22.131
It's a mild case of windburn, Aunt Harriet.

15:22.297 --> 15:25.050
You see, this afternoon,
Dick and I took an open bus tour...

15:25.217 --> 15:28.011
...through the Wayne Animal Sanctuary.

15:28.178 --> 15:31.598
Well, I'm going to get you some salve
for those lips.

15:31.765 --> 15:34.226
Just in case a pretty girl wants to kiss you.

15:37.604 --> 15:41.233
Boy, I'll bet you'll never wanna kiss another girl
as long as you live, Bruce.

15:41.400 --> 15:44.736
I wouldn't go so far as to say that, Dick.
You're jumping to a rash conclusion.

15:44.903 --> 15:48.198
Aw, you looked like you were putting up
quite a struggle, all right.

15:48.365 --> 15:51.285
I think there was some kind of potion
in her lipstick.

15:51.452 --> 15:55.956
- Potion?
-Yes. I think a love-inducing elixir of some sort.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.958
No wonder your lips are chapped.

15:58.125 --> 16:01.503
It took a great amount of concentration
to combat its effectiveness.

16:01.670 --> 16:04.089
Good. Speaking of the immediate future...

16:04.256 --> 16:06.967
...why do you think
Penguin is shooting tomorrow's scene...

16:07.134 --> 16:09.720
...at the Gotham City Museum of Antiquities?

16:09.887 --> 16:14.183
He claims he wants to use the museum
as a background for his films.

16:14.349 --> 16:18.145
But I suspect he has something
bigger in mind.

16:18.437 --> 16:22.232
Shouldn't we do something? That museum
is full of priceless and irreplaceable art.

16:22.399 --> 16:24.401
I have done something about it, Dick.

16:24.568 --> 16:27.779
I went to the museum and planted
Bat-homing devices on every object of art.

16:27.946 --> 16:31.325
Ah, Alfred. Have you been keeping an eye
on the Bat-radar scopes?

16:31.492 --> 16:34.995
Yes, sir. And so far the signals
from the Bat-homing devices indicate...

16:35.162 --> 16:37.748
...that all the objects of art
are still in the museum.

16:37.915 --> 16:39.333
<i>Hmm.</i>

16:39.500 --> 16:44.755
I suspect some of the objects will be moved
before the night is over.

16:44.963 --> 16:47.257
And we'll know exactly
where Penguin's taken them.

16:47.424 --> 16:50.302
So far, our overall plan is working
like a charm, Bruce.

16:50.469 --> 16:53.388
So far, Dick. So far.

16:54.973 --> 16:57.851
Didn't you think I was magnificent
in that love scene, darling?

16:58.018 --> 17:01.021
Well, you were certainly better
than the potion in that lipstick.

17:01.188 --> 17:03.190
That left Batman colder than an iceberg.

17:03.357 --> 17:06.527
Yes, Aunt Hilda obviously forgot
to put enough oomph into it.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.820
- Anyway, your plan is working so far.
-What do you mean, so far?

17:09.988 --> 17:12.907
A Penguin plan is money in the bank.

17:13.200 --> 17:17.246
Money in the bank is no good to us, darling.
Our problem is getting it out of the bank.

17:17.412 --> 17:20.499
Don't worry, it'll be out of the bank
and in our hands soon enough.

17:20.665 --> 17:23.877
You see, stage one is already in progress.

17:24.044 --> 17:26.755
Right now my men should be
at the Museum of Antiquities.

17:26.922 --> 17:29.299
And stage two is likewise under control.

17:29.466 --> 17:33.387
Now for stage three. I will need another
love potion from your aunt Hilda.

17:33.554 --> 17:35.973
And one that'll really, really work this time.

17:36.139 --> 17:37.641
I'll see what I can do, darling.

17:37.808 --> 17:40.811
In the meantime,
you'll have to tell me what stage three is.

17:42.187 --> 17:44.648
- Tell me.
-No, I never trust a woman with a secret.

17:44.815 --> 17:48.610
And if you're nothing else, Marsha,
you're certainly a woman.

17:48.777 --> 17:51.697
A woman with diamonds, darling.

17:51.863 --> 17:54.491
Or would you rather return
my collateral to me?

17:54.658 --> 17:57.828
No, no. That's extortion, Marsha.

17:57.995 --> 18:02.124
You should know, darling. You should know.

18:03.709 --> 18:07.254
- Hello, Aunt Hilda.
-Hello, dearie.

18:09.506 --> 18:10.966
What is that?

18:11.133 --> 18:14.219
Mortimer, say hello to Marsha.

18:17.806 --> 18:20.976
Aunt Hilda,
have you been robbing graveyards again?

18:21.143 --> 18:23.437
Oh, no, dearie.

18:23.604 --> 18:25.939
I left off that 20 years ago...

18:26.106 --> 18:29.985
...when I was chemistry professor at Vassar.
Until I quit.

18:30.152 --> 18:31.945
Don't you mean until you were fired?

18:32.112 --> 18:35.616
A term I find most unappealing, dearie.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.868
Speaking of things unappealing...

18:38.035 --> 18:39.703
...where did you get that?

18:39.870 --> 18:43.123
I left one of the potions
in the caldron overnight...

18:43.290 --> 18:46.627
...and next morning, there was Mortimer.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.211
He's really quite friendly.

18:50.047 --> 18:53.925
How are you doing with your other potions
these days, Aunt Hilda?

18:54.092 --> 18:55.385
Other potions?

18:55.552 --> 18:58.221
That one you put in my lipstick
was a complete failure.

18:58.388 --> 19:01.433
Well, that was because I ran out
of chameleon tongues, dearie.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.978
- But if you want something really strong--
-I do, I do.

19:05.145 --> 19:08.482
I was just about to whip up one of my bests.

19:08.649 --> 19:11.735
The old toad potion.

19:11.902 --> 19:14.363
My very strongest.

19:16.239 --> 19:18.867
Oh, dear.

19:19.034 --> 19:21.453
I'm afraid I'm out of old toads too.

19:22.162 --> 19:24.164
Can't you substitute some new toads?

19:25.499 --> 19:28.377
It would never work, dearie.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.922
We've just got to get some more old toads.

19:44.393 --> 19:46.770
It doesn't look as if Penguin took anything,
Batman.

19:46.937 --> 19:47.979
No it doesn't, Robin.

19:48.146 --> 19:51.983
All our homing devices seem to be in place.

19:52.442 --> 19:54.861
But I'm still suspicious, Robin.

19:55.028 --> 19:57.906
Suspicious of what, Caped Codger?

19:58.073 --> 20:04.079
Don't tell me you're suspicious of the Penguin
tampering with these priceless works of art.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.248
The thought did cross my mind.

20:06.415 --> 20:11.253
What, a great filmmaker like myself stooping
to a petty theft? Why, that's ridiculous.

20:11.420 --> 20:13.672
What's ridiculous is thinking
you're a great filmmaker.

20:13.839 --> 20:16.758
I write the lines around here, Boy Blowhard.

20:16.925 --> 20:18.427
You stick to the script.

20:18.802 --> 20:21.888
Speaking of which,
your big scene is coming up.

20:22.055 --> 20:25.434
I must see to it that everything is,
heh, prepared.

20:29.563 --> 20:32.399
- Batman, thank heaven you're here.
-What's wrong, Mr. Tamber?

20:32.566 --> 20:36.486
The museum's priceless collection
of 15th-century chain-mail armor, it's gone.

20:36.653 --> 20:38.280
That's impossible. Our Bat-homing--

20:38.447 --> 20:42.159
There is one factor I could've overlooked,
Robin.

20:42.325 --> 20:45.328
The metal alloy in that armor
could've set up a magnetic field...

20:45.495 --> 20:47.414
...which blocked our homing transmission.

20:47.581 --> 20:49.750
You have to get them back, Batman.

20:49.916 --> 20:54.463
That unique alloy was invented
by the great master Benvenuto Violini.

20:54.629 --> 20:55.672
Violini.

20:55.839 --> 20:58.425
Yes, he made the chain-mail armor out of it.

20:58.592 --> 21:02.888
We'll try our best, Mr. Tamber.
But I think you should move out of this room.

21:04.222 --> 21:06.224
There could be some trouble here.

21:09.853 --> 21:12.731
I think Batman has discovered
the missing armor.

21:12.898 --> 21:15.108
We'd better start this scene early.

21:15.275 --> 21:18.111
All right, Batman, a light rehearsal.

21:18.278 --> 21:19.988
Action.

21:20.822 --> 21:25.076
I have a strange feeling Penguin is going
to make this a very realistic scene, Robin.

21:25.243 --> 21:28.580
If he wants realism, we'll give him realism.

21:30.874 --> 21:34.586
Detail, halt. Prepare to fight. One, two.

21:42.135 --> 21:45.305
That's it. Skewer the scrofulous scullion.

21:45.472 --> 21:48.183
Spear him like a cucumber. Quack, quack!

21:52.229 --> 21:55.607
That's not in the script, Batman.
I'm directing this scene.

21:55.774 --> 21:57.984
Maybe we'll get you in the scene, Penguin.

22:55.500 --> 22:59.254
Those costumed cutups
are slicing my finks to ribbon.

23:06.469 --> 23:08.805
Uh... Quack.

23:13.518 --> 23:15.770
Shield your eyes, Robin.

23:18.690 --> 23:22.694
Ah. Now we'll give those two-bit actors
a piece of real action.

23:24.529 --> 23:28.325
This catapult will hurl you through the sky
and across Gotham City.

23:28.491 --> 23:31.411
I'm sure you'll make a big splash
at the other end of your journey.

23:33.455 --> 23:37.334
And your last moments on Earth
will be recorded for posterity...

23:37.500 --> 23:40.253
...by those two cameras
that I've strapped to your legs.

23:40.420 --> 23:42.547
And I'll show the film at a special premiere...

23:42.714 --> 23:47.385
...for the Benefit of the Amalgamated Crooks
of Gotham City.

23:47.552 --> 23:54.100
The In-Flight Motion Pictures Benefit
of Penguin Productions Unlimited.

23:58.396 --> 24:02.984
Good flight, masked missiles.
We'll watch from a better vantage point.

24:05.487 --> 24:07.322
Farewell.
