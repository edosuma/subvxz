02:29.670 --> 02:31.840
How the hell did I get up here?

02:32.200 --> 02:33.730
I still can't believe it.

02:34.060 --> 02:37.410
Just four weeks ago,
I was a completely different person.

02:37.580 --> 02:39.330
I had no adventure in my life.

02:39.430 --> 02:40.510
I had a wife.

02:40.620 --> 02:42.050
I had a family.

02:42.950 --> 02:46.220
And I never looked twice
when a pretty girl walked by.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.680
Never.

04:12.570 --> 04:14.360
- Four, please.
- Me, too.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.120
- Can I help you?
- Yes, I'm looking... What's that?

04:48.220 --> 04:50.780
It's the air conditioner.
It'll come on in a second.

04:52.480 --> 04:53.720
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.420
I beg your pardon!

04:55.520 --> 04:57.210
I'm losing my briefcase.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.420
I don't know.

05:10.910 --> 05:13.150
No, I've never tried it that way before.

05:14.210 --> 05:15.290
No, I'm not worried.

05:15.400 --> 05:18.210
It's just that I've never tried it
in that position before.

05:18.340 --> 05:19.480
It's all new to me.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.350
Well, I know you have to wet it
before you put it in.

05:24.450 --> 05:26.210
You have to, or it could break off.

05:27.330 --> 05:29.540
How far? I don't know how far.

05:30.820 --> 05:32.350
All the way, I suppose.

05:33.480 --> 05:36.450
I know you have to keep wiggling it
to get all the hairs off it.

05:36.550 --> 05:37.830
All right!

05:38.410 --> 05:40.060
Put that phone down.

05:40.460 --> 05:42.840
I can't talk to you now. I'll call you back later.

05:42.950 --> 05:44.810
Do you have to talk like that at work?

05:44.900 --> 05:47.460
Can't you save that filthy stuff
until you get home?

05:48.010 --> 05:49.700
That was my brother.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.290
- Your brother?
- Yeah.

05:52.870 --> 05:55.840
He and I are trying to set up
a photo-processing lab at my place.

05:55.950 --> 05:58.050
That way I can take stuff home. For example...

05:58.150 --> 05:59.430
All right!

06:00.360 --> 06:03.940
- Where's the figures on the cable-car campaign?
- It's on the third floor...

06:04.040 --> 06:07.010
Get them for me right away!
We've wasted enough time on this.

06:07.120 --> 06:08.290
Yes, sir.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.090
I spent two months on that.

06:46.290 --> 06:49.010
- I want you to roll down the map and show me.
- All right.

06:49.110 --> 06:50.150
Okay.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.200
Hello?

06:58.360 --> 07:00.590
Will you have dinner with me tonight?

07:02.610 --> 07:03.630
What?

07:05.880 --> 07:08.360
La Primavera, in North Beach.

07:08.980 --> 07:10.160
Tonight.

07:11.250 --> 07:12.880
I know who you are.

07:14.680 --> 07:15.920
9:00?

07:17.080 --> 07:18.360
Why?

07:18.610 --> 07:19.990
Just because.

07:26.970 --> 07:29.460
I can't make it at...

07:29.590 --> 07:31.700
...9:00.

07:32.510 --> 07:34.780
Say, 9:10?

07:34.870 --> 07:35.800
Yes.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.620
Why are you speaking to me in German?

07:59.420 --> 08:00.400
Why?

08:01.410 --> 08:05.200
I mean, the modeling agency told me
that you were from Germany.

08:05.310 --> 08:06.420
It's not me.

08:06.530 --> 08:07.870
Well, I'd better check.

08:08.580 --> 08:10.070
Where am I going?

08:53.730 --> 08:55.140
How do I look?

08:56.550 --> 08:58.660
The earrings are too much, aren't they?

08:58.760 --> 09:01.280
Here, you keep 'em for me, honey.

09:01.380 --> 09:03.520
I'll do it. You keep your eyes on the road.

09:03.620 --> 09:05.050
They were killing me, anyway.

09:05.160 --> 09:07.100
Didi, what was I gonna ask you?

09:07.210 --> 09:08.700
I wanted to ask you something.

09:10.060 --> 09:12.130
Would you like to go to the movies tonight?

09:12.230 --> 09:13.540
Tonight's study group.

09:14.250 --> 09:15.740
What do you mean?

09:15.850 --> 09:18.090
What's today? Today's Wednesday?

09:18.410 --> 09:20.320
I thought today was Thursday.

09:20.490 --> 09:22.400
What's the matter with me?

09:23.050 --> 09:25.440
I'd like to go anyway, if it's all right with you.

09:25.550 --> 09:27.300
I can't put up with those crazies tonight.

09:27.400 --> 09:31.080
It's all arranged.
You're taking the girls to the movies.

09:31.720 --> 09:35.240
I promised them you would.
Anyway, you deserve a night out.

09:36.490 --> 09:38.150
So, what do you say?

09:40.210 --> 09:43.560
- What do you mean? Of course. Sure.
- You're wonderful.

09:55.470 --> 09:56.620
Honey.

09:57.490 --> 09:58.770
See you tonight.

09:58.860 --> 10:00.560
Thanks for the lift.

10:14.100 --> 10:15.950
You know, you're cute when you serve.

10:16.180 --> 10:19.310
Go ahead, Teddy. What are you nervous about?
Serve the ball.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.750
Now come on, calm down.
Let the man serve, Buddy.

10:21.850 --> 10:25.420
You got nothing to worry about.
It's only set point. It's not like your life.

10:25.530 --> 10:26.960
It's just your self-respect.

10:27.190 --> 10:29.870
Give him that solid one. Give him the ace.
Teddy, come on!

10:29.970 --> 10:31.730
What is it? Am I talking too much?

10:31.830 --> 10:34.610
We'll calm down. We'll take it easy.
Teddy wants to serve.

10:34.710 --> 10:35.860
Okay?

10:35.960 --> 10:37.900
You can do it. Put it right in there.

10:38.900 --> 10:39.830
What a serve!

10:39.930 --> 10:40.860
Switch!

10:40.950 --> 10:45.040
Okay, here we go now. You ready?
Get that racquet ready, I'm coming at you.

10:45.140 --> 10:46.900
This baby is mine!

10:47.000 --> 10:48.380
- You hit the net.
- Follow-through.

10:48.470 --> 10:50.300
- You can't!
- On the follow-through!

10:50.390 --> 10:53.260
- You still can't hit the net.
- I hit it on the follow-through.

10:53.370 --> 10:56.120
I hit this ball first, then the net,
on the follow-through.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.870
It's our point. It's 6-2. You're in the shit house.

10:58.970 --> 11:01.790
- Anybody ever tell you you're cute?
- You're cute, too.

11:02.360 --> 11:03.920
- How you doing?
- Okay.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.920
What's the matter, he getting to you?

11:07.040 --> 11:07.960
No.

11:08.060 --> 11:09.920
- So, what's that matter?
- Nothing.

11:10.010 --> 11:10.940
Hey!

11:11.480 --> 11:12.700
Look at that!

11:12.800 --> 11:16.030
Oh, my. That is serious Nautilus.

11:17.820 --> 11:19.350
Miss!

11:19.740 --> 11:20.670
Thank you.

11:24.130 --> 11:26.550
Those are fine-looking racquets
you got there, girls.

11:26.660 --> 11:28.350
What are they, Heads?

11:32.550 --> 11:34.780
Joe, there's a phone call for you.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.950
Do me a favor and take it for me, will you?

11:38.240 --> 11:41.110
I met them on separate nights.
How could I know they're sisters?

11:41.220 --> 11:43.260
- You're in a lot of trouble, Joe.
- No way.

11:43.360 --> 11:47.840
I got a date with the little one at 7:00
and the older one at 9:15. Plenty of time.

11:49.540 --> 11:50.720
What about Theresa?

11:51.680 --> 11:53.030
What about Theresa?

11:53.600 --> 11:56.600
Doesn't she notice anything
when you go with someone for a while?

11:56.710 --> 12:00.700
Like you used to go with that girl before.
Doesn't she think anything's up?

12:01.290 --> 12:02.210
Look.

12:02.890 --> 12:06.530
Theresa's got the kids to worry about.
She's too busy to notice anything.

12:06.630 --> 12:07.870
And they're great kids.

12:07.970 --> 12:10.530
She's 38 years old,
she's a very happily married woman.

12:10.630 --> 12:12.040
You see. She smiles all the time.

12:12.130 --> 12:13.990
- Does she do it?
- Does she do what?

12:15.180 --> 12:17.060
What do you mean, "Does she do what?"

12:17.160 --> 12:20.460
- What do you mean, "Does she do what?"
- Does she does she do it, too?

12:20.550 --> 12:22.920
- Do what, too?
- Does she have affairs, too?

12:27.530 --> 12:30.080
Teddy, you're my friend, and I love you.

12:30.220 --> 12:32.450
You're a sweet, sensitive guy...

12:32.590 --> 12:34.020
...but you're very naive.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.720
To think that my Theresa...

12:35.820 --> 12:38.400
...would fool around?
- I just asked a question.

12:38.510 --> 12:41.990
Do you believe this man asking
whether my Theresa would fool around?

12:42.090 --> 12:45.220
I find it hard to imagine
your wife sleeping with you.

12:47.660 --> 12:49.350
Teddy.

12:49.580 --> 12:51.270
What am I laughing at?

12:52.850 --> 12:54.220
Are you sure?

12:55.120 --> 12:57.390
All right, I'll let him know. Thank you.

12:58.570 --> 13:01.190
- Are you staying for lunch, Doctor?
- No. Joe!

13:12.720 --> 13:14.350
What else did the neighbor say?

13:14.770 --> 13:17.640
Nothing. She was coming over
to return a warming tray...

13:17.750 --> 13:20.020
...and she ran into the bunch
coming down the steps.

13:20.110 --> 13:22.800
Theresa, the kids, and all the furniture.

13:23.790 --> 13:25.740
There was a big van waiting for them.

13:28.370 --> 13:29.350
What a bitch.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.600
Come on, she was our friend, too.

13:31.700 --> 13:33.290
Wonder if it was her furniture?

13:33.400 --> 13:36.180
- Why do you have to talk about that?
- What should we do, cry?

13:36.280 --> 13:39.280
I just want to know
if she had a right to take all the furniture.

13:41.270 --> 13:42.800
Is it from Theresa?

13:44.920 --> 13:47.570
Found a picture of me with another woman.

13:47.830 --> 13:49.010
Naked?

13:49.370 --> 13:50.860
In a night club.

13:55.510 --> 13:56.760
This isn't happening.

14:03.640 --> 14:07.060
This isn't fucking happening!
It's not happening!

14:08.310 --> 14:09.430
Son of a bitch!

14:09.530 --> 14:12.530
Bitches, fucking whore!

14:19.580 --> 14:21.620
Teddy, what could we do to cheer up Joe?

14:22.270 --> 14:25.050
- Want to do the blind man with me tonight?
- I can't do that.

14:25.150 --> 14:27.540
- You do the blind man with me?
- No, I get nervous.

14:27.650 --> 14:28.790
Joe needs a good laugh.

14:28.890 --> 14:31.200
We'll take him to the place
where they threw him out.

14:31.290 --> 14:32.500
I get too nervous.

14:32.610 --> 14:35.960
Came in with a cardigan.
They wanted him to put on one of their jackets.

14:36.670 --> 14:38.880
- Okay, Michael? Come on.
- No, I get too nervous.

14:38.970 --> 14:41.940
- Are you tied up with Mrs. Schumacher?
- I'm not tied up with her.

14:42.050 --> 14:43.610
- His boss's wife.
- I don't believe it.

14:43.710 --> 14:47.420
I'm telling you. You were away on vacation.
He's banging Dr. Schumacher's wife.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.070
Son-of-a-gun!
Are you making it with Schumacher's wife?

14:50.180 --> 14:51.640
- Only at night.
- Lf it's an emergency.

14:51.750 --> 14:53.340
- "Only at night?"
- Ask him.

14:53.440 --> 14:55.260
The time it takes me to drive there...

14:55.360 --> 14:58.620
...is the exact same time it takes him
to scrub and put on his gloves.

14:58.720 --> 15:02.750
If it's not a big job, it's not worth it to me.
If it's appendicitis, I don't go.

15:02.880 --> 15:05.700
But, if it's peritonitis or a gall bladder...

15:05.800 --> 15:09.440
"Hello, honey, good news.
It's a quadruple bypass!"

15:10.370 --> 15:12.100
So, you say like this:

15:13.060 --> 15:15.880
"Is Mr. Pierce there, please?" Very timid.

15:16.930 --> 15:19.840
- "Is Mr. Pierce there, please?"
- That's it, just like that.

15:19.940 --> 15:22.050
Then I'll get on the phone and say, "Hello?"

15:22.150 --> 15:26.620
Then I'm going to wait a few seconds,
like I'm listening to you, and then I'll say:

15:27.240 --> 15:28.250
"What?

15:28.620 --> 15:30.590
"You want me to come out right now?

15:30.790 --> 15:34.440
"Are you sure that you can't handle this
by yourself, Richard?"

15:34.950 --> 15:37.410
- Who's Richard?
- Richard's my assistant.

15:37.610 --> 15:39.360
He works here at the office with me.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.280
Clear?

15:42.950 --> 15:44.100
Is it a woman?

15:46.030 --> 15:47.520
Is it a woman?

15:47.850 --> 15:49.310
No. It's...

15:49.420 --> 15:51.390
"Is it a woman?"

15:51.720 --> 15:53.480
What goes on in your head?

15:53.900 --> 15:55.660
No, it's just...

15:55.820 --> 15:57.190
...we're planning...

15:58.890 --> 16:00.450
Well, it's too complicated.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.900
But don't tell Didi...

16:02.060 --> 16:03.970
...because it's a wonderful surprise.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.020
- You want me to call you at 8:15?
- 8:15.

16:06.130 --> 16:07.820
It has to be at 8:15 sharp.

16:19.380 --> 16:21.480
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hello, sweetie pie.

16:23.310 --> 16:25.320
Did Mom tell you about tonight?

16:27.890 --> 16:30.220
- No. Missy, I'm sorry...
- I'm sorry, Daddy, but...

16:30.320 --> 16:32.430
...Shelly didn't get the tickets until 4:00.

16:32.630 --> 16:34.930
I know you really wanted to go to the movie...

16:35.030 --> 16:38.320
...but it's a once-in-a-lifetime chance,
and his uncle had some pull.

16:38.420 --> 16:41.070
- What tickets are you talking about?
- David Bowie.

16:42.420 --> 16:44.240
You mean, you can't go to the movie?

16:44.500 --> 16:46.470
I'm sorry, Daddy. I feel so bad.

16:46.680 --> 16:49.130
No. Don't be silly.

16:49.240 --> 16:50.960
Are you really disappointed?

16:52.180 --> 16:53.110
Well...

16:54.040 --> 16:57.420
No, I mean, I wanted to go, sure, but...

16:58.970 --> 17:00.430
So these things happen.

17:00.530 --> 17:01.880
I understand that.

17:04.050 --> 17:07.369
- You remember Shelly, don't you?
- Of course.

17:12.440 --> 17:13.750
How are you?

17:15.579 --> 17:16.849
How are you?

17:17.560 --> 17:18.510
I'm fine.

17:18.910 --> 17:19.829
I'm fine.

17:27.450 --> 17:29.840
You're a Jewish boy, aren't you?

17:30.360 --> 17:32.310
My mother and father are Jewish.

17:34.560 --> 17:36.050
I see.

17:38.780 --> 17:41.940
- You're taking my little girl to see David Boowie?
- Bowie.

17:42.050 --> 17:43.740
Bowie.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.140
You take care...

17:49.820 --> 17:51.250
...of my girl.

17:52.570 --> 17:54.460
You take care of my girl.

18:01.120 --> 18:04.190
Now, of course,
I'm sure you've heard about the alphabet diet.

18:04.350 --> 18:06.210
Now, that takes 26 weeks.

18:06.560 --> 18:10.720
The first week,
you're allowed anything that begins with an "A."

18:11.360 --> 18:15.160
And, then onto the second week,
you're allowed anything that begins with a "B."

18:15.620 --> 18:17.410
There's only one problem.

18:17.510 --> 18:20.860
You have to watch yourself carefully
because by the time you get to "P"...

18:20.960 --> 18:23.520
...you might put on all the weight
you lost on "K."

18:23.620 --> 18:24.730
Excuse me.

18:24.840 --> 18:28.990
And then, when you get to "X,"
it's very difficult...

18:29.250 --> 18:32.640
...because you start making up
your own spelling, like "X- Benedict"...

18:32.740 --> 18:34.400
..."X- tra helpings."

18:34.500 --> 18:36.890
So, I would not recommend that diet.

18:42.150 --> 18:44.260
You go through my pockets now?

18:44.840 --> 18:45.980
No.

18:46.090 --> 18:48.840
Not yet. I owe Marty $10.

18:49.740 --> 18:51.140
I think he likes you.

18:51.430 --> 18:52.860
You think everyone likes me.

18:52.970 --> 18:54.660
- They do.
- Oh, well.

18:55.140 --> 18:57.860
Can I get you anything
before I start my study group?

18:58.600 --> 19:00.010
Oh, God.

19:05.350 --> 19:07.690
What honey? What's the matter?

19:07.790 --> 19:10.850
Nothing. It's not even worth talking about.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.040
What?

19:13.480 --> 19:17.710
I was leaving my office and the boss comes in
with this pile of stuff and two assistants...

19:17.810 --> 19:20.170
...says, "Clean this up for tomorrow morning."

19:20.270 --> 19:22.280
"Clean this up." Now I'm a cleaning man.

19:22.700 --> 19:25.900
- Will it take long?
- Take long? No, not if I work all night.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.290
I'm just so tired, that's all.
I just don't know if I can stay awake.

19:29.390 --> 19:30.730
I'm so tired.

19:30.830 --> 19:32.940
Baby. Here.

19:33.740 --> 19:36.110
I gave half to Richard, but...

19:36.300 --> 19:39.980
...he panics, he gets so nervous.
I don't know if he can handle it.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.990
Baby. Can I fix you a drink?

19:43.760 --> 19:44.940
You know...

19:45.070 --> 19:47.440
...I really think they're taking advantage of me.

19:47.540 --> 19:51.430
- Want Campari and soda?
- Yeah, that would be nice.

19:52.560 --> 19:53.640
Thanks.

19:55.860 --> 19:57.040
You just...

19:57.840 --> 20:00.490
You gotta draw a line and say, "No more.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.050
"You can't go past this line."

20:04.560 --> 20:05.940
Who's staying for dinner?

20:42.170 --> 20:44.150
Honey, why are you shaving?

20:48.480 --> 20:49.910
Why am I shaving?

20:52.060 --> 20:53.850
What the hell is the matter with me?

20:55.960 --> 20:58.390
Did you want this tie out?

20:59.900 --> 21:00.830
No.

21:00.930 --> 21:02.620
What do I want another tie for?

21:04.000 --> 21:05.790
Honey, you're overtired.

21:06.170 --> 21:10.000
I think that you should take a little nap
before you eat.

21:18.780 --> 21:20.280
Come here and sit close to me.

21:21.890 --> 21:22.940
What's this?

21:23.300 --> 21:25.370
What do you mean? This is Joe's little boy.

21:25.470 --> 21:27.960
I know it's Joe's little boy,
but what's he doing here?

21:28.070 --> 21:30.490
S-M-l-L-E.

21:31.080 --> 21:32.540
Where is his...

21:33.150 --> 21:34.940
...M- O-M-M-Y?

21:35.040 --> 21:38.460
She didn't tell me. It's just for one night.

21:38.560 --> 21:41.760
- She didn't tell you?
- No, she didn't.

21:41.990 --> 21:43.610
Don't frighten him.

21:48.130 --> 21:49.560
What a cute little pee-pee.

21:49.670 --> 21:52.130
You leave his little pee-pee alone.

21:52.230 --> 21:55.010
His Daddy's little pee-pee started all this.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.940
One, two, three. Hit it.

22:11.820 --> 22:15.430
- Hello, gentlemen. How are we tonight?
- Fine, how you feeling, Andy?

22:15.530 --> 22:18.850
How am I feeling? What do you mean?
Why shouldn't I be feeling fine?

22:18.950 --> 22:21.860
No, this nice man
just wanted to know how you were.

22:21.960 --> 22:22.890
I'm fabulous!

22:22.990 --> 22:25.320
I've never felt better in my life!

22:25.550 --> 22:27.110
Well, great.

22:27.560 --> 22:28.580
What'll you have?

22:28.680 --> 22:30.720
- What'll you have?
- Southern Comfort with ice.

22:30.830 --> 22:31.940
Make that two.

22:32.040 --> 22:33.420
Okay. You bet.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.820
I'll be right back. I gotta lock my car.

22:36.490 --> 22:37.900
There you are.

22:38.930 --> 22:39.870
Cigarette?

22:39.980 --> 22:43.020
- What was that?
- Nothing, sir. Just setting up your drinks.

22:44.240 --> 22:46.310
- What was that?
- Nothing.

22:47.180 --> 22:48.230
Jake!

22:50.580 --> 22:52.430
- He said he'd be back in just...
- Jake!

22:52.530 --> 22:54.280
He said he'd be back in a minute, Andy.

22:54.380 --> 22:57.380
- How did you know any name?
- Well, your friend called you...

22:57.490 --> 22:58.500
Jake!

23:11.990 --> 23:12.940
Where are you?

23:13.240 --> 23:14.350
What is this?

23:14.450 --> 23:15.530
What are you doing?

23:15.640 --> 23:17.010
What are you doing with me?

23:20.500 --> 23:21.930
What is this?

23:22.710 --> 23:24.720
What the hell is this thing?

23:25.720 --> 23:27.860
What kind of a place is this?

23:28.340 --> 23:29.270
Hey!

23:29.560 --> 23:31.220
- I'm right here, Andy.
- Jake!

23:31.380 --> 23:32.430
I'm right here.

23:32.570 --> 23:34.960
Don't ever leave me again, Jake.

23:37.720 --> 23:40.820
I'm sorry, he can't, he's...

23:41.020 --> 23:42.100
Sorry.

23:59.260 --> 24:03.630
At the tone,
the time will be 8:09 and 50 seconds.

24:11.520 --> 24:13.820
All right, time to go back to bed.

24:14.780 --> 24:18.330
You don't want your mommy
to be angry with me, do you?

24:18.880 --> 24:20.120
Come here.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.730
I want my mommy.

24:40.030 --> 24:43.070
When you wake up,
your mommy will be here to pick you up.

24:50.050 --> 24:51.360
Night-night.

24:54.400 --> 24:55.580
Is she on a date?

24:56.160 --> 24:59.160
I don't know.
She asked me to keep him for one night.

24:59.270 --> 25:01.160
Well, what about the other kids?

25:01.250 --> 25:02.530
I don't know.

25:02.950 --> 25:04.860
Well, what am I supposed to say to Joe?

25:05.670 --> 25:09.220
Nothing!
Don't you tell that son of a bitch anything!

25:09.320 --> 25:11.770
Come on now. He's our friend.

25:11.880 --> 25:13.370
He's a rat.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.640
I would have left him long before she did.

25:17.830 --> 25:19.590
What is that supposed to mean?

25:20.100 --> 25:22.530
If anything like that ever happened to us...

25:23.720 --> 25:25.610
...I don't know what I would do.

25:26.890 --> 25:30.150
- We better just drop the subject.
- No. Now, wait a minute.

25:30.250 --> 25:32.490
Now we're talking nicely and calmly.

25:32.590 --> 25:34.860
Let's hear what you have to say on the subject.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.040
Teddy...

25:36.460 --> 25:40.390
I know you think you know everything about me,
but you don't.

25:41.100 --> 25:43.750
I'm really a very jealous woman.

25:45.070 --> 25:48.710
I know you think, emotionally, I'm like this, but...

25:48.810 --> 25:50.310
...you know, I really...

25:51.210 --> 25:52.360
...am a little...

25:52.490 --> 25:53.830
...crazy.

25:56.010 --> 25:58.440
But just in some ways.

26:01.780 --> 26:04.230
- Why are you telling me all this?
- You asked me.

26:04.340 --> 26:07.980
I know I asked you,
but you make it sound as if we're not a happily...

26:08.750 --> 26:09.700
What?

26:09.970 --> 26:11.340
What have you got there?

26:11.730 --> 26:12.680
It's a gun.

26:12.780 --> 26:15.310
I know it's a gun,
but when did you ever get a gun?

26:15.410 --> 26:17.710
Well, Mama gave it to me after they moved.

26:21.810 --> 26:24.180
You realize you might have shot me?

26:24.470 --> 26:26.030
I would never do that.

26:26.130 --> 26:28.020
I mean, not without a reason.

26:28.210 --> 26:29.710
You're not like Joe.

26:29.810 --> 26:32.980
Do you know what he did to Theresa,
right in front of me?

26:33.970 --> 26:36.530
He had his secretary call at 10:00 at night...

26:36.630 --> 26:39.280
...and say he had work to do at the office.

26:41.430 --> 26:43.370
- He did that?
- Yes.

26:44.980 --> 26:46.960
You mean, that old trick still works?

26:48.280 --> 26:49.810
Not anymore.

26:51.900 --> 26:53.170
I'll get it.

26:55.380 --> 26:56.330
Hello?

26:57.500 --> 26:59.770
Yes, just a minute. It's Richard.

27:04.280 --> 27:05.390
Hello.

27:06.550 --> 27:09.010
Yes, Richard. How are you?

27:11.100 --> 27:12.080
Yes.

27:15.610 --> 27:17.270
You what?

27:21.240 --> 27:22.670
Is this a joke?

27:23.000 --> 27:26.140
You want me to do what?

27:26.750 --> 27:28.310
Are you crazy?

27:29.180 --> 27:30.200
They said...

27:32.570 --> 27:34.070
They said I should do...

27:35.230 --> 27:37.170
I should do what?

27:37.820 --> 27:40.640
They want me to come out at 10:00 at night...

27:40.800 --> 27:42.970
...and leave my wife and children?

27:43.810 --> 27:47.040
I don't care!
8:15, 10:00, what difference does it make?

27:47.140 --> 27:48.890
I'm not a wind-up toy.

27:48.990 --> 27:52.950
You tell my superiors at the office,
who can give me raises and promotions...

27:53.060 --> 27:57.730
...that if they don't like my answer,
they can go take it and shove it up their ass.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.290
That's the best joke I've heard all year.

28:04.710 --> 28:05.690
Hey!

28:06.370 --> 28:08.160
Now what's going on?

28:08.450 --> 28:11.620
Hey, fellas, come on now.

28:11.720 --> 28:14.620
Let's just shake hands, we'll go home.

28:14.720 --> 28:17.030
What the hell did you hit him for,
for Christ's sake?

28:17.120 --> 28:20.420
What kind of a fellow are you,
pushes a blind man?

29:06.060 --> 29:07.140
Hello?

29:11.820 --> 29:13.830
Okay. I'll be right over, sweetheart.

29:14.830 --> 29:16.770
Are you sure it's a gallbladder?

31:31.270 --> 31:33.860
You better hurry.
They moved the meeting up 15 minutes.

31:33.960 --> 31:36.160
Why doesn't anybody ever tell me these things?

32:09.130 --> 32:10.950
It's like an oven over there.

32:11.720 --> 32:14.030
Air conditioning must be on the blink again.

32:14.730 --> 32:16.040
What's that?

32:16.840 --> 32:19.300
She's the girl they chose for
the cable-car campaign.

32:19.400 --> 32:20.680
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

32:21.810 --> 32:24.110
- Who is she?
- Ask the boss. He found her.

32:24.210 --> 32:27.170
He goes riding once a week in Golden Gate Park.

32:27.410 --> 32:29.550
Guess what he saw galloping through the fog?

32:29.650 --> 32:31.170
Horseback riding?

32:43.120 --> 32:44.100
Ridden much?

32:44.210 --> 32:45.930
Yes, since I was a little boy.

32:46.030 --> 32:48.650
I used to teach horseback riding
to earn extra money.

32:49.140 --> 32:51.240
- See you later.
- See you later.

32:52.500 --> 32:55.080
Okay! Here we go!

32:55.700 --> 32:56.630
Come on.

33:04.210 --> 33:05.260
Everything okay?

33:05.360 --> 33:08.270
Yes. I have a pebble...

33:08.470 --> 33:10.320
...in my finger, in the glove.

33:10.900 --> 33:13.070
Better to get it out now than when you're...

33:13.400 --> 33:15.670
...tearing along like that, you know.

33:16.090 --> 33:18.360
Okay! Come on, big fella.

33:19.730 --> 33:21.230
Hi-ho, Thunder!

33:21.340 --> 33:22.260
Away!

33:24.890 --> 33:25.970
Everything's okay?

33:26.070 --> 33:28.790
Yeah, I was just wondering
whether I should call my wife...

33:31.700 --> 33:32.910
Hey!

33:33.020 --> 33:35.160
The ride to the left is the prettiest!

33:35.290 --> 33:39.410
Yes, I just want to take a look
over here for a second!

33:43.580 --> 33:45.520
I searched all day long...

33:46.140 --> 33:49.140
... but I couldn't find that woman
who was haunting me.

33:52.060 --> 33:52.990
Hello?

33:55.320 --> 33:57.690
How would you like to smoke the peace pipe?

33:57.880 --> 33:59.100
Who is this?

33:59.680 --> 34:01.140
You don't know me?

34:02.010 --> 34:04.760
I had dinner alone at La Primavera.

34:06.300 --> 34:07.480
It's you.

34:10.170 --> 34:12.480
I'm so sorry I wasn't there the other night.

34:12.580 --> 34:14.100
Please, forgive me.

34:14.239 --> 34:15.699
My mother had a heart attack.

34:15.810 --> 34:18.389
I had to spend the night with her in the hospital.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.630
- How is she?
- Better.

34:22.210 --> 34:25.409
She's trotting around.
I mean, she's walking around nicely now, but...

34:26.110 --> 34:27.810
...it was a terribly close call.

34:28.260 --> 34:30.429
Do you know Le Club...

34:30.530 --> 34:33.080
...at the corner of Jones Street and Clay?

34:33.670 --> 34:34.650
Yes.

34:38.080 --> 34:39.489
5:00.

35:02.220 --> 35:03.520
Hi-ho, pal.

35:03.620 --> 35:05.530
- Got a light?
- Yeah.

35:07.780 --> 35:09.990
- Thanks. Catch you later.
- Sure.

35:48.910 --> 35:49.860
Heart.

35:52.140 --> 35:53.830
Family heart!

36:17.300 --> 36:18.350
Help!

36:22.520 --> 36:24.080
Somebody help!

37:45.090 --> 37:46.100
Hello!

37:47.870 --> 37:48.890
Wait!

37:57.920 --> 37:58.870
Don't move!

38:03.330 --> 38:04.350
Move!

38:05.570 --> 38:06.520
Go!

38:13.700 --> 38:14.780
Hello!

38:14.890 --> 38:15.870
Wait!

38:16.230 --> 38:17.540
Hello, there!

38:22.180 --> 38:24.010
Easy, big fella. Easy!

38:29.230 --> 38:30.720
Steady, Thunder!

38:31.150 --> 38:33.930
Steady, boy! Take it easy.
Everything's under control.

38:34.120 --> 38:36.010
You're in no danger whatsoever.

38:36.110 --> 38:37.320
Easy does it.

38:37.420 --> 38:38.530
Don't be nervous.

38:38.640 --> 38:39.720
Hello, there.

38:40.560 --> 38:41.640
Hello.

38:41.840 --> 38:43.810
That's a gorgeous animal you have there.

38:44.360 --> 38:45.830
I'm somewhat of an expert.

38:46.030 --> 38:47.920
That's a superb specimen.

38:48.140 --> 38:51.560
- She's a beauty.
- Yes, he is nice. Thank you.

38:51.660 --> 38:52.610
Wait!

38:54.130 --> 38:55.140
Move!

38:56.210 --> 38:57.130
Go!

38:57.230 --> 38:59.690
Right, Thunder! To the right, Thunder.

38:59.790 --> 39:01.160
To the right!

39:07.310 --> 39:08.690
Hello again.

39:09.300 --> 39:11.630
Mind if I ride along with you for a while?

39:12.050 --> 39:13.130
No. I don't mind.

39:13.230 --> 39:14.920
Fancy meeting you here.

39:15.760 --> 39:17.040
Do you ride very often?

39:17.140 --> 39:19.440
Yes, since I was a boy.

39:20.150 --> 39:23.020
I used to teach riding
in order to earn a little extra money.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.400
- Really?
- Yes.

39:26.450 --> 39:29.140
By the way, about the other night.

39:29.720 --> 39:31.240
I wanted to explain.

39:31.350 --> 39:32.880
What other night?

39:34.100 --> 39:35.280
I see.

39:35.380 --> 39:36.310
Excuse me!

39:36.400 --> 39:40.150
All right, you want to play it that way,
it's all right with me. I don't mind.

39:41.460 --> 39:42.920
My riding crop.

39:43.090 --> 39:45.270
That's all right. I'll get it.

39:45.370 --> 39:46.990
Say, "I'm sorry," Thunder.

39:47.130 --> 39:48.750
Say, "I am sorry."

39:48.850 --> 39:50.680
Thunder is a sweet horse...

39:50.930 --> 39:52.690
...but, boy, is he dumb!

39:56.470 --> 39:58.540
I hate to be too hard on him.

39:58.870 --> 40:00.560
It could kill his spirit, but...

40:01.080 --> 40:02.260
...boy, is he...

40:02.940 --> 40:05.360
You're a silly horse!

40:05.750 --> 40:07.380
He's just a baby, you know.

40:08.510 --> 40:09.750
Here you are.

40:11.740 --> 40:12.980
Thank you.

40:13.980 --> 40:15.640
You're very gallant.

40:16.540 --> 40:17.750
I'm just...

40:18.140 --> 40:19.960
...a romantic, I guess.

40:23.770 --> 40:25.330
Be good this time.

40:25.500 --> 40:26.650
Be good.

40:27.070 --> 40:28.440
Don't embarrass me.

40:28.990 --> 40:31.510
Wait. Whoa, Thunder!

40:40.290 --> 40:42.460
Wait! You dropped something.

40:51.330 --> 40:53.780
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

40:58.050 --> 41:00.380
- Good night, Ted.
- Good night, Sharon.

41:00.510 --> 41:03.580
- Have a nice night, Mr. Pierce.
- Thank you. Same to you, Richard.

41:52.460 --> 41:54.080
Why, hello!

41:54.640 --> 41:56.040
Hello, yourself.

41:56.140 --> 41:58.030
What a pleasant surprise.

41:58.540 --> 42:01.540
Well, not really.
I just came to give you back your earring.

42:02.190 --> 42:04.330
- What earring?
- I don't know whose it is.

42:04.430 --> 42:07.880
It fell out of your pocket yesterday
when you got off your horse.

42:07.980 --> 42:10.880
I decided to pick it up after you left so quickly.

42:11.340 --> 42:14.510
Well, it's a nice earring, but it's not mine.

42:14.610 --> 42:16.610
What would I be doing with an earring?

42:16.910 --> 42:18.190
So what's new?

42:18.290 --> 42:20.230
I'm gonna be late for my dance class.

42:20.530 --> 42:21.480
No, wait!

42:22.350 --> 42:24.390
How about having dinner with me?

42:26.830 --> 42:27.880
Thank you, but no.

42:28.050 --> 42:30.980
I know of this funny little place.

42:31.220 --> 42:35.110
It's a fun little Chinese place,
where you sit down on the floor...

42:35.220 --> 42:39.530
...and you can eat with your hands or chopsticks
or anything you want.

42:39.860 --> 42:41.170
For lunch?

42:41.460 --> 42:43.350
No, I'm not free for lunch or dinner.

42:44.500 --> 42:46.190
A little snack in-between?

42:47.380 --> 42:49.040
I'd better be going.

43:11.480 --> 43:15.670
- What's your name?
- Theodore Pierce. Teddy. Ted.

43:20.180 --> 43:22.160
Tomorrow, 6:00, Tulio's.

43:22.550 --> 43:24.590
- On Columbus?
- Yeah.

43:27.230 --> 43:28.540
How old is that suit?

43:29.240 --> 43:30.930
This? I don't know.

43:31.290 --> 43:33.750
Six, seven, eight years, maybe.

43:33.850 --> 43:35.190
It looks it.

43:37.720 --> 43:39.670
Wait! What's your name?

43:39.900 --> 43:41.140
Charlotte!

43:53.820 --> 43:55.510
Even longer on the pants.

43:55.710 --> 43:58.010
Longer on the pants?

43:58.980 --> 44:00.090
More sleeve.

44:00.220 --> 44:01.850
You want more sleeve than this?

44:02.020 --> 44:03.770
Listen to me! This is what I know!

44:03.870 --> 44:05.950
But, Buddy, are you sure this style suits me?

44:06.050 --> 44:09.460
- You want to look good at funerals?
- No, I just want to look nice.

44:09.570 --> 44:10.850
Let me see.

44:19.110 --> 44:20.600
Put your arms down.

44:20.710 --> 44:22.880
Now you're cooking with Crisco!

44:29.920 --> 44:31.350
Robert Redford.

44:35.880 --> 44:37.570
Mr. Dengilihan! Great news!

44:37.670 --> 44:41.860
I just got the figures from Community Affairs.
The cable-car campaign's a smash!

44:41.960 --> 44:45.030
All the TV stations, Channel 5, Channel 3...

44:45.130 --> 44:46.980
...the newspapers, the magazines...

44:47.110 --> 44:50.410
...all they're talking about is
the reopening of the cable cars.

44:50.500 --> 44:52.680
It's unbelievable. You wouldn't believe it.

44:53.130 --> 44:55.400
It's better than our wildest imagination.

44:55.500 --> 44:59.330
We couldn't have hoped for a better campaign
than what we've got right now.

44:59.430 --> 45:00.610
It's due to you, sir.

45:00.710 --> 45:03.910
It's a wonderful tribute to the whole concept.

45:18.860 --> 45:21.070
Hey. What it is?

45:26.770 --> 45:29.800
I'd like to make a reservation for tonight, please.
A double room.

45:31.210 --> 45:34.060
Something with a king-size bed, if you have it.

45:34.320 --> 45:35.730
Let me have a look.

45:35.860 --> 45:38.340
We have that available.
Can I have your name, please?

45:38.450 --> 45:39.590
Irving.

45:40.140 --> 45:41.350
Julius...

45:41.810 --> 45:42.920
...lrving.

45:43.020 --> 45:45.410
All right. Could you spell that for me, please?

45:46.070 --> 45:49.030
L-r-v-i...

45:50.990 --> 45:52.040
No, wait a minute!

45:52.150 --> 45:53.090
Yes, sir?

45:53.200 --> 45:55.370
E-r-v-i...

45:55.760 --> 45:56.910
...n- g.

46:00.850 --> 46:04.300
Is there a Theodore Pierce here? Mr. Pierce?

46:04.560 --> 46:06.470
Sorry, nobody here by that name.

46:06.840 --> 46:08.430
Well, nobody's answering.

46:09.720 --> 46:10.670
All right.

46:11.350 --> 46:12.430
Now wait.

46:12.570 --> 46:14.220
Miss Charlotte who?

46:14.330 --> 46:16.590
Wait! Hello! Don't hang up, please.

46:16.690 --> 46:18.580
That's for me. Thank you.

46:19.480 --> 46:21.810
Hello, Charlotte? It's Teddy. Where are you?

46:21.910 --> 46:23.440
I'm in Los Angeles.

46:23.960 --> 46:26.130
In Los Angeles? What are you doing there?

46:26.230 --> 46:27.570
I'm sorry, I'm working.

46:27.670 --> 46:30.260
I tried to phone you at work,
but you were in a meeting...

46:30.360 --> 46:32.080
... and you couldn't be interrupted.

46:32.180 --> 46:33.130
No.

46:33.910 --> 46:35.740
So, listen, why don't you fly down?

46:35.830 --> 46:37.110
To Los Angeles?

46:37.500 --> 46:41.240
The last flight gets here at 10:00 p.m.
I can meet you at the airport.

46:42.840 --> 46:44.090
But I can't just...

46:44.190 --> 46:46.290
Listen, we'll spend the evening together...

46:46.400 --> 46:49.910
... and we'll be back in San Francisco
by 10:00 tomorrow morning.

46:51.680 --> 46:52.760
Hello?

46:53.980 --> 46:55.360
Teddy, hello?

47:43.300 --> 47:46.330
- Honey. What's all this, cutie?
- A celebration.

47:46.440 --> 47:48.060
- For what?
- Just for fun.

47:48.160 --> 47:51.840
I'm too tired to go out, so I wanted
to have a party, just you, the kids and me.

47:51.940 --> 47:53.050
What do you think?

48:17.130 --> 48:20.000
- Shall we have a drink?
- That would be nice.

48:23.820 --> 48:26.020
But take the phone off the hook.

48:28.140 --> 48:30.150
Would you like to make love?

48:30.540 --> 48:31.520
Now?

48:34.060 --> 48:36.610
Take the phone off the hook.

48:43.760 --> 48:44.840
Who's that?

48:44.940 --> 48:46.280
I don't know yet.

48:49.520 --> 48:51.590
Telegram for Theodore Pierce.

49:01.070 --> 49:02.800
It's a telegram!

49:03.310 --> 49:05.930
- A telegram? Who for?
- For you.

49:06.030 --> 49:07.180
For me?

49:07.730 --> 49:08.910
Who from?

49:11.060 --> 49:14.830
- It's from the office.
- All right. Stop the kidding, now.

49:15.060 --> 49:16.470
No, it's not a joke.

49:16.560 --> 49:20.520
"You must attend the transport symposium
in San Diego. Stop.

49:20.660 --> 49:22.520
"Big press coverage. Stop.

49:22.610 --> 49:25.200
"Tickets at airport. 8:30 flight. Stop.

49:25.300 --> 49:28.910
"Return San Francisco tomorrow. Stop.
Russell Loughry."

49:38.170 --> 49:39.150
No.

49:40.020 --> 49:41.230
- No?
- No.

49:44.500 --> 49:45.780
I'm not going.

49:45.880 --> 49:47.670
- Teddy!
- I'm not going.

49:47.830 --> 49:48.980
No.

49:53.530 --> 49:54.710
I am not going.

49:54.810 --> 49:56.180
Well, how can you say no?

49:56.280 --> 49:59.730
Easy. No. You see that?
That's not so difficult, is it?

49:59.830 --> 50:03.700
I'm not going! I don't care if they fire me!
I'm not leaving my wife and kids!

50:03.800 --> 50:05.360
Don't act like a child!

50:05.470 --> 50:06.870
Teddy! Stop.

50:11.900 --> 50:14.290
Wait a minute! Hold the plane!

50:15.900 --> 50:17.240
Wait for me!

50:17.340 --> 50:19.000
Hold it! Wait!

50:26.110 --> 50:29.240
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are beginning our descent into Los Angeles.

50:29.340 --> 50:33.140
Please fasten your seat belts,
extinguish all smoking materials...

50:33.250 --> 50:35.350
Finished with your drink, sir?

50:36.860 --> 50:38.290
- What's your name?
- Polly.

50:38.400 --> 50:39.330
Polly?

50:39.650 --> 50:41.950
- That's a lovely name.
- Thank you.

50:42.560 --> 50:44.730
- Thanks very much, Polly.
- Sure.

50:49.280 --> 50:51.490
Sure, you make the announcement.

50:55.560 --> 50:56.700
Ladies and gentlemen.

50:56.800 --> 51:01.560
The captain has just informed me that
L.A. Airport is closed due to heavy fog.

51:02.500 --> 51:07.140
We will be landing in San Diego. You'll receive
further instruction once we're on the ground.

51:11.300 --> 51:12.420
Thanks a lot.

51:31.630 --> 51:32.640
Hello?

51:33.290 --> 51:34.780
Hi, honey.

51:35.470 --> 51:38.660
I was running from outside.
I heard the phone ringing.

51:39.210 --> 51:41.100
No, it's okay.

51:41.320 --> 51:42.500
Go ahead.

51:45.100 --> 51:47.300
I took Shelly and the girls to a movie.

51:50.190 --> 51:51.620
Well, don't worry about me.

51:51.730 --> 51:55.850
I have to study, anyway.
Shelly, please get out of my bedroom.

51:55.950 --> 51:57.380
Are you afraid?

52:01.230 --> 52:02.250
What?

52:03.630 --> 52:06.570
Teddy, why are you giving me all these details?

52:07.280 --> 52:09.830
- I am going to scream.
- So will I.

52:10.190 --> 52:12.780
Of course you're in San Diego.
Where else would you be?

52:12.880 --> 52:15.880
- I am going to tell your mother.
- She already knows.

52:17.070 --> 52:18.090
What?

52:18.740 --> 52:20.840
- You're crazy.
- I want to marry you.

52:24.050 --> 52:27.210
Yes, there's plenty of food.
Don't worry about me.

52:27.310 --> 52:28.430
Shelly!

52:28.660 --> 52:30.380
Of course I miss you.

52:31.030 --> 52:32.210
Me, too.

52:32.630 --> 52:34.090
I love you.

52:34.930 --> 52:36.080
Me, too.

52:38.040 --> 52:39.890
I love you. Bye-bye.

52:43.090 --> 52:45.680
Are you going to finish the game or not?

52:46.810 --> 52:48.370
You got any Hershey bars?

52:56.250 --> 52:59.100
While Didi was waiting for me
in San Francisco...

52:59.480 --> 53:02.100
... Charlotte was waiting in Los Angeles.

53:02.780 --> 53:05.910
Two women waiting for me
in the middle of the night.

53:07.100 --> 53:09.070
Crazy as it seems...

53:09.370 --> 53:11.570
... I had adventure in my life.

53:25.850 --> 53:27.760
Surprise of surprises.

53:27.870 --> 53:30.720
Next day, Joe's wife came back with the kids...

53:31.130 --> 53:32.480
... and the furniture.

53:37.150 --> 53:40.470
Why she suddenly forgave him, nobody knew.

53:49.890 --> 53:50.940
Eric?

53:52.060 --> 53:53.440
Is there an Eric?

53:56.740 --> 53:57.920
Come on.

54:09.570 --> 54:12.510
The next couple of days were full of surprises.

54:13.160 --> 54:14.430
Hello, Ted.

54:15.210 --> 54:18.690
I just wanted to say,
"Good morning, and have a lovely day."

54:29.990 --> 54:30.970
Hello?

54:31.080 --> 54:32.740
Hello, how are you?

54:46.920 --> 54:50.150
The best surprise of all
was a phone call from Charlotte.

54:50.380 --> 54:52.000
I thought I wouldn't see her again...

54:52.110 --> 54:55.750
... but she called to find out
I got back all right from San Diego.

54:57.800 --> 55:02.510
During our 35-minute stroll,
I realized I was still in a deep fog.

55:05.550 --> 55:06.660
Here you go.

55:06.760 --> 55:10.030
The only unpleasant surprise
was that in two days...

55:10.290 --> 55:11.660
... Joe was back in form.

55:11.760 --> 55:12.740
He's scared.

55:12.850 --> 55:14.730
At 2:00 in the morning, he could fool me.

55:14.830 --> 55:17.770
What's the problem?
You go over, you get into bed, you say:

55:17.870 --> 55:21.960
"Dr. Schumacher, I've got a chill coming on.
I thought I'd better get under the covers."

55:22.640 --> 55:24.530
You guys want to play some checkers?

55:24.880 --> 55:26.030
Miss!

55:26.220 --> 55:29.090
- You know where I can buy some checkers?
- That's embarrassing.

55:29.200 --> 55:32.200
I'm in the mood to play a little game
if you have some time.

55:32.310 --> 55:35.210
- I'm very good, really.
- Yeah, right.

55:36.530 --> 55:40.080
She wasn't wearing a bra. Did you see that?
Did you see the way they bounce?

55:40.180 --> 55:42.860
You'd kill for that, Teddy. You'd kill for that.

55:43.060 --> 55:45.610
- I didn't notice she wasn't wearing a bra.
- You're weird.

55:45.710 --> 55:47.410
- I looked at her, though!
- You're weird.

55:47.510 --> 55:48.910
He's a weird guy, isn't he?

55:49.040 --> 55:53.100
- Did you notice that she didn't have a bra?
- What do I know, 'cause I see it every day?

55:56.980 --> 55:58.640
You poor bitch.

57:06.340 --> 57:07.770
It's open.

57:08.070 --> 57:09.950
- How you doing?
- Good.

57:15.550 --> 57:17.660
I thought you'd painted this place.

57:18.500 --> 57:21.180
I was going to, before I moved in with my friend.

57:25.570 --> 57:28.120
Well, you've got a nice chair.

57:28.390 --> 57:29.570
Thanks.

57:30.150 --> 57:32.900
- What color you gonna paint?
- Shocking pink!

57:45.700 --> 57:48.700
This man walks into a doctor's office,
he says, "Doctor...

57:49.160 --> 57:52.230
"...I have a terrible problem.
I can't remember anything."

57:52.360 --> 57:53.470
And...

57:53.740 --> 57:55.010
...the doctor says...

57:55.430 --> 57:56.860
...I mean, the man says:

57:56.970 --> 57:58.560
"I can't think of...

57:59.110 --> 58:01.320
"I don't even remember words.

58:01.420 --> 58:02.880
"I can't retain a word.

58:02.990 --> 58:05.350
"There's nothing that I say that I can remember."

58:05.450 --> 58:06.980
And the doctor says:

58:07.080 --> 58:08.940
"How long have you had this problem?"

58:09.030 --> 58:10.920
And the man says, "What problem?"

58:19.210 --> 58:20.740
That's your best joke?

58:23.500 --> 58:25.130
You'll be all right.

58:25.520 --> 58:27.180
It just takes time.

58:35.950 --> 58:38.250
You want to see something? Look at this thing.

58:38.350 --> 58:39.660
I feel silly.

58:39.790 --> 58:41.870
- What if I had a date?
- You won't have a date.

58:41.970 --> 58:44.520
- I said, "What if I have a date?"
- You won't have one!

58:44.620 --> 58:47.280
I know I said that. I said, "What if I had a date?"

58:47.380 --> 58:50.030
If you have a date, I'll be your chauffeur!

58:50.510 --> 58:51.690
All right.

58:53.270 --> 58:55.630
- The joke is over.
- A bet's a bet.

58:56.630 --> 58:58.420
What was this bet?

58:59.640 --> 59:03.600
I told him if I couldn't get him
his new car by tonight, I'd be his chauffeur.

59:05.010 --> 59:07.730
- So, where are we going?
- We're going to Mama Dell's.

59:08.050 --> 59:10.700
You're going on your first date
to your grandmother's?

59:10.800 --> 59:12.810
No, you silly!

59:13.110 --> 59:16.590
We made this date and I remembered
it was Mama Dell's birthday...

59:16.690 --> 59:21.070
...so I called her and I found out
she's gonna be all alone on her 85th birthday.

59:21.170 --> 59:24.340
We'll drop by for five minutes,
just to have a glass of champagne.

59:24.440 --> 59:27.540
But I'd feel terrible,
because I know it would mean so much to her.

59:27.640 --> 59:30.190
- You don't mind, do you?
- Of course not.

59:31.260 --> 59:33.940
You don't feel concerned at all that...

59:35.960 --> 59:39.090
- What?
- Well, no, I'm just saying, you know.

59:39.320 --> 59:40.920
You know where...

59:41.880 --> 59:43.190
Didi?

59:43.580 --> 59:46.390
Didi and Mama Dell
don't even talk to each other.

59:46.650 --> 59:47.700
Okay.

59:49.950 --> 59:51.290
Who's Didi?

59:57.050 --> 59:58.360
Who's Didi?

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:03.830
Didi...

01:00:08.290 --> 01:00:09.560
Didi is...

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:17.980
Didi is Teddy's other grandmother!

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:20.440
Funny woman.

01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:22.930
Can't mention her name, but it makes you laugh.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.540
What a kidder!

01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:26.300
That Didi.

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:34.370
Will you do me a favor,
and come up for three minutes?

01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:35.390
She loves you.

01:00:35.490 --> 01:00:37.120
Two minutes. We'll have champagne...

01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:40.830
Okay, I'll just come up to say hello
and give her a kiss. But I can't stay.

01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:44.160
- All right, I'll see you in two minutes.
- Driver, you can't park here.

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:46.600
Don't give me a hard time.
I'll be a couple minutes.

01:00:46.690 --> 01:00:50.560
I'm not giving you a hard time.
You either move the car, or I call the police.

01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:51.970
Go ahead up. I'll be right up.

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:53.960
- See you in a little while.
- All right.

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:09.630
- You look beautiful tonight.
- Thank you.

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:14.560
- You smell very good. What is it?
- Sandalwood.

01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:17.730
Don't worry, we don't have to stay long.
She'll understand.

01:01:17.830 --> 01:01:19.970
- Is that you, Teddy?
- Mama Dell.

01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:21.120
Come in, honey.

01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:24.610
What's going on here?
You trying to save on the electricity bills?

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.340
Mama Dell?

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:28.030
I'd like you to meet a...

01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:31.880
"Happy birthday to you

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.800
"Happy birthday to you

01:01:34.890 --> 01:01:38.790
"Happy birthday, dear Teddy

01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:42.440
"Happy birthday to you"

01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:43.910
Well!

01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:47.430
How do you like that?

01:01:48.010 --> 01:01:49.540
I don't believe it!

01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:52.910
No. Gilbert!

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:55.760
- What are you doing here? You're in Arizona!
- Happy birthday.

01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:57.200
But my birthday's tomorrow.

01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:58.440
Ain't no surprise tomorrow.

01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:01.230
Steetsy, what're you doin' up so late?

01:02:01.330 --> 01:02:04.050
- It's Steven, now.
- All right, no more Steetsy.

01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:05.770
- Happy birthday, honey.
- Thank you.

01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:07.570
Thank you, baby. Thank you very much.

01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:09.870
You! Devil-woman!

01:02:09.970 --> 01:02:10.920
Happy birthday!

01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:14.090
- What're you doin' to me?
- You should've seen the look on your face.

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.810
You know why?
Because it's supposed to be your birthday!

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:19.220
- Didi.
- Happy birthday, sweetheart.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.780
- Happy birthday, Daddy.
- My little baby!

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.150
- Happy birthday, Daddy.
- Another little baby.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.000
Daddy, you smell good.

01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:30.410
Did I introduce you?

01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:31.790
Didi.

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:33.850
Well, let me introduce you.

01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:36.650
I was just so overwhelmed.

01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:38.900
I'd like you to meet...

01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:40.720
This is...

01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:43.760
Everybody, please say hello to...

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:48.280
You know, you really caught me off guard,
you silly people.

01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:50.420
No, honestly, you did. You're silly!

01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:52.530
You're just silly people.

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:56.500
Anyway, no, I do want you to say hello.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.420
- I want you to meet...
- Where's Mama Dell?

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:01.210
Where's that girl? Hello, darling.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.050
Didi. Hello, darling!

01:03:08.890 --> 01:03:11.450
Hey, you lost some weight there,
you're lookin' great!

01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:13.720
How are you? I didn't know it was a party!

01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:17.200
- We didn't know you were coming!
- I'm not coming. I mean, I can't stay.

01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:20.310
I just wanted to come by
and give the birthday girl a kiss!

01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:22.590
Happy birthday, sweetie pie!

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.510
- Did you say hello, Charlotte?
- Hello.

01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:30.560
This is my sweetheart, Mama Dell.
This is my sweetheart.

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:32.510
I love this girl!

01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:35.000
Hello, Charlotte.

01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:37.440
- Sit down, Charlotte.
- No, we can't stay.

01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:39.900
- We've got tickets to a...
- It takes two minutes!

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.210
She's crazy about music! What can I tell you?

01:03:42.310 --> 01:03:46.080
No, she a stickler for being on time.
She's trying to reform. No, we can't.

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:48.630
It's a family party, everybody.

01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:51.460
Happy birthday, Teddy.
I'll give you your present tomorrow.

01:03:51.550 --> 01:03:53.310
Good-bye, Mama Dell. Happy birthday!

01:03:53.410 --> 01:03:54.870
Say good-bye.

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:56.820
Say, good-bye, Charlotte.

01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:58.650
Good-bye.

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.060
Good-bye.

01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:02.500
All right. Good-bye, everybody.

01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:07.200
Yeah, Daddy, hurry up.

01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:19.300
Hold it! I'll be right there.

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.790
Bye, Mama. Thank you for everything.

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:24.350
- 'Bye, cuz. See you tomorrow.
- Happy birthday, Teddy.

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:25.950
Bye-bye.

01:04:26.410 --> 01:04:28.130
Bye! Come back soon.

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:31.780
- Now, I told you, you cannot stay up late.
- But let me watch this one show.

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:32.830
No!

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:35.880
If it's cotton, and if it's blue, you can't go wrong.

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:38.730
Now don't go neurotic on me.
I loved that present.

01:04:38.830 --> 01:04:39.840
Teddy!

01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:41.190
I'm sorry. It's your birthday.

01:04:41.290 --> 01:04:43.360
I hate to run interrupt your celebration.

01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:45.670
He's flipped out. I think he's gonna kill himself.

01:04:45.770 --> 01:04:48.040
- I don't know who you're talking about.
- Joe!

01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:50.960
She left him! She walked out.
I don't know what happened.

01:04:51.050 --> 01:04:52.780
- Where is he?
- Across the street.

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:54.220
I'm really sorry.

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:57.250
- Teddy's like the voice of reason.
- You did right. It's terrible.

01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:00.070
- I'm terrible at this kind of stuff, Didi!
- Michael!

01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:03.660
- Joe, I'm right here. Will you talk to me?
- She left me. I gotta kill her.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:04.900
Joe, calm down.

01:05:05.010 --> 01:05:07.400
- You leave me alone so I can kill her!
- Joe!

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:08.880
I gotta kill her!

01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:10.540
I gotta kill her!

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:13.320
- Calm down! Just calm down.
- Let me kill her.

01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:15.020
You'll be all right.

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.540
Take it easy, you stupid bastards!

01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:19.020
I'm finished.

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.140
I'm done!

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.290
Calm down!

01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:22.640
I'm finished!

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.870
- Teddy, should I go home?
- Yeah!

01:05:26.550 --> 01:05:29.040
- What?
- Yes! Go home!

01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:30.090
It's okay.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:34.860
- Do you have a key?
- Yes! Get the kids out of here!

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:37.520
All right! Girls, go on. I'll be there in a minute.

01:05:38.770 --> 01:05:41.490
- She took my kids again.
- Get in the car.

01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:44.460
- Why did she take my kids again?
- It'll be all right tomorrow.

01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:46.950
- I want to kill her!
- Get in the driver seat.

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:48.040
Get in the car.

01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:51.410
- Shut up, down there!
- Up yours, you half a hard on!

01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:53.400
Let me get that peckerhead!

01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:12.600
Joe, I know you're in a lot of pain,
but I want to tell you something.

01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:15.350
No, Teddy! I want to tell you something.

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:21.880
- "Happy birthday to you"
- No.

01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:24.700
- "Happy birthday to you"
- No.

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:28.470
- "Happy birthday, dear Teddy"
- You fucks! You fucking jerks!

01:06:28.570 --> 01:06:30.680
"Happy birthday to you"

01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:34.740
You're babies, you're little babies,
the biggest assholes I've ever seen my life!

01:06:34.850 --> 01:06:37.600
- We never said we weren't assholes.
- I said I was an asshole.

01:06:37.690 --> 01:06:40.120
Where are we going? Will somebody tell me?

01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:44.860
- Somebody wants to see you.
- She's modeling from midnight till dawn.

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:47.710
And she wants you for breakfast.

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.840
What am I supposed to say to her?

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:53.760
You say to her,
"Hello, angel-face, you want to see my goods?"

01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:56.090
Get out of here! She wants you. Move it!

01:06:56.190 --> 01:06:59.230
- It was her idea. Ask Buddy.
- She likes you. Go figure.

01:06:59.330 --> 01:07:02.050
What are you talking about?
Look at that face and those eyes.

01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:05.250
Look at how that nose sparkles.
What more could you want in a guy?

01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:09.210
- How am I supposed to know? Ask Buddy.
- Screw Buddy. I can go for him myself.

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:12.730
If he'd just shave his legs, like I keep telling him.
Shave 'em!

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:15.970
- Happy birthday, Teddy!
- Happy birthday, pal!

01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:19.200
Wait a minute. Come here a sec.

01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:22.810
Look, really, in all seriousness,
don't get your dick caught in your zipper.

01:07:24.450 --> 01:07:27.170
- You have no taste!
- Taste? Who wants taste?

01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:30.720
What the hell am I? Charlie the Tuna?
Get out of here. Let's get action.

01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:34.210
We're running out of laughs.
Let's go to the opera, drop our pants.

01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:15.189
Now, listen here, Teddy bear.

01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.790
Four weeks ago...

01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:19.260
...I met a cute, available...

01:09:19.350 --> 01:09:20.760
...old-fashioned guy...

01:09:20.859 --> 01:09:22.830
...who liked horse riding.

01:09:24.569 --> 01:09:26.029
In one month...

01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:27.670
...you got married...

01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:30.260
...you had two daughters...

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.649
...and you can't ride a horse to save your life.

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.840
Don't stare at your shoes, look at me.

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.770
Because since tonight...

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.660
...I want you more...

01:09:42.430 --> 01:09:45.010
...then I ever wanted any other man.

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:49.080
Can you tell me why?

01:09:49.850 --> 01:09:51.200
I don't know.

01:10:18.430 --> 01:10:22.110
You've been dreaming about this
for a long time, haven't you?

01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:26.980
This isn't a dream anymore.

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:29.570
This is really happening.

01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:09.380
So, where do you want to break the ice?
Here or in bed?

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:13.380
Well...

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:14.470
Let's see.

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:16.810
I don't mind really.

01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:18.920
This is nice here.

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:21.670
The bed is good,
bed might be comfortable, but...

01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:25.130
...lots of interesting chairs,
and stools, couches...

01:11:25.230 --> 01:11:26.640
Come on, let's go to bed.

01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:49.260
It's a water bed.

01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:52.370
This should be fun.

01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:55.530
Wait a minute. Do you come
into bed with your shoes and socks?

01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:58.670
Sorry.

01:12:24.570 --> 01:12:26.770
Don't want to start a fire.
They landed on the lamp.

01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:28.690
Do you mind taking them off?

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:32.240
Sorry.

01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:11.990
Come and get it, cowboy.

01:13:26.050 --> 01:13:27.100
Hello?

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:28.180
Charlotte?

01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:32.160
Charlotte!

01:13:33.890 --> 01:13:34.820
Yes!

01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:41.560
What is it?

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.770
Nothing, my husband's downstairs.

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:47.230
- Your husband!
- Yeah. Hurry up, come on, get dressed!

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:49.630
What do you mean, "Hurry up"?
What husband?

01:13:49.730 --> 01:13:51.010
Please, hurry up!

01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:54.010
- He wasn't due back until Friday.
- But it's only Wednesday.

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:57.530
Yeah, you want to ask him why?
He's six-foot-two and he's an airline pilot.

01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:00.360
If he finds you here, he's going to kill you.
Get dressed.

01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:38.880
What are you doing in my husband's robe?

01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:40.780
I'm not going to get caught half-dressed!

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:43.940
Why play games?
I'll talk to him man to man, that's all.

01:14:44.050 --> 01:14:46.950
Are you crazy?
He's going to tear your balls apart!

01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:49.770
- What are you doing? Where are we going?
- Quickly, get outside!

01:14:49.870 --> 01:14:53.290
- This is a window!
- I know it's a window. It's this or the door.

01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:56.210
You must be joking! That's 100 feet down there.

01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:57.860
Please! I won't be very long.

01:14:57.970 --> 01:15:00.010
- Come on, Charlotte!
- I won't be long.

01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:02.670
He's probably got a taxi waiting.
He never stays long.

01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:04.770
Just stand out on the ledge.

01:15:05.170 --> 01:15:07.890
- Please, quickly. Don't worry. It's safe.
- God.

01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:11.020
- Now, just wait for me there.
- Jesus.

01:15:30.970 --> 01:15:32.460
Coming, darling.

01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:48.940
Get away.

01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:06.710
Who is that?

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.190
My God!

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:40.220
Better call the fire department!
There's a man about to jump off of that building!

01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:00.120
- What's up, babe? Where we goin'?
- Suicide.

01:17:11.010 --> 01:17:13.800
No! Not the ladder! It scares them.

01:17:13.890 --> 01:17:15.970
It makes them jump every time! Take it down!

01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:18.370
Take it out of here, take it down!

01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:23.300
Come on, people, a little cooperation here!

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:27.330
Let's have some cooperation. This is
a dangerous area. We've got a man up there.

01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:31.460
Come on, folks.

01:17:36.010 --> 01:17:37.800
Come on, folks. Give us a break.

01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:40.460
Excuse me.

01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:48.480
Roger, we got it!

01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:50.250
- You got him?
- I got him.

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:54.540
Come on, people.

01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:58.980
Okay, stand by.
Fine, we have reached the network.

01:17:59.790 --> 01:18:01.320
Stand by. Counting down.

01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:05.220
Five-four-three-two-one. You're on.

01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:08.580
Good morning.
This is Marvin Kausberg, Channel 5 news.

01:18:09.550 --> 01:18:11.280
That looks a little like Daddy.

01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:13.580
... a man was seen on the ledge of a ninth-floor...

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:14.660
It does!

01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:17.410
The identity of the man is not yet known.

01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:22.280
The police have arrived and the fire department
suicide team, plus a substantial crowd.

01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:25.390
All of us waiting here,
in the small courtyard below...

01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:28.720
... are very unclear as to
what the man's motives are.

01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:30.670
He appears relaxed.

01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:35.020
In fact, he's seated on a small window sill,
smoking a cigarette.

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:37.360
But he looks disturbed by all the attention...

01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:40.460
... as he hides his face
and waves the crowd away.

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.570
The police are trying to control the crowd...

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:44.500
... who are now calling for the man to jump.

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:46.190
The question being asked here today...

01:18:46.290 --> 01:18:49.640
... is whether this man
does or does not want to commit suicide.

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:51.570
Teddy!

01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:55.320
Two, three.

01:18:58.070 --> 01:19:00.050
It'll be all right!

01:19:00.570 --> 01:19:02.870
We'll catch you!

01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:10.130
Dive!

01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:22.390
- Baby!
- That's so good.

01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:34.260
Yes!

01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:42.490
What the hell am I doing?

01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:45.370
I have a wonderful wife!

01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:47.030
Jump!

01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:51.130
I could have thrown my whole life away.

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:52.890
And for what?

01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:54.560
A piece of ass.

01:20:09.570 --> 01:20:13.350
What's that girl doing?
What is she doing, taking more pictures?

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:15.780
No, give me a break!

01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:18.080
She is cute, though.

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:20.290
Look at those legs!

01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:23.360
Hey, come on, now, stop it. None of that stuff.

01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:25.920
I made a mistake, I learned my lesson...

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:28.390
... and I will never do it again.
