WEBVTT

00:06.740 --> 00:08.476
YES, MY NAME IS
PAUL WESTON.

00:08.576 --> 00:09.777
I'VE BEEN ON HOLD.

00:09.877 --> 00:11.345
Woman:
How can I help you, sir?

00:11.445 --> 00:13.747
I'M THE EXECUTOR
OF MY FATHER'S ESTATE

00:13.847 --> 00:15.583
AND I WANTED TO--

00:15.683 --> 00:17.785
Can you hold on, sir,
while I pull up the account?

00:17.885 --> 00:19.953
- SURE, OKAY, I'LL HOLD.
- Female voice: Thank you
for holding.

00:20.054 --> 00:22.890
You call is very
important to us and your
estimated wait time--

00:22.990 --> 00:25.159
( sighs, dialing )

00:27.495 --> 00:29.497
- Man: Claim services.
- HELLO.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.765
- Yes, can I help you?
- THIS IS PAUL WESTON.

00:31.865 --> 00:35.336
AND MY FATHER HAD
A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY
WITH YOU AND--

00:35.436 --> 00:37.405
Can you hold on
while I get an agent?

00:37.505 --> 00:38.806
OKAY, I'LL HOLD.

00:38.906 --> 00:41.041
( hangs up, dials )

00:45.313 --> 00:47.081
Man:
Hello.
Bank of New Trust.

00:47.181 --> 00:49.417
- YES, HELLO.
- How can I help you?

00:49.517 --> 00:52.820
- MY NAME IS PAUL WESTON.
- Yes, Mr. Weston, how can
I help you?

00:52.920 --> 00:55.789
MY FATHER JUST PASSED AWAY.
HE HAD TWO ACCOUNTS WITH YOU.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.826
Can I have your father's
security code, please?

00:58.926 --> 01:01.329
NO, I DON'T KNOW
HIS SECURITY CODES.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.497
I think I'm gonna have
to transfer you.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.299
NO, BUT JUST DON'T
PUT ME ON HOLD.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.235
- Hold one second.
- DON'T PUT ME ON HOLD, PLEAS.

01:07.335 --> 01:09.537
- Just a quick second.
- PLEASE DON'T--

01:09.637 --> 01:12.173
GOD DAMN IT!

01:16.644 --> 01:18.779
( phone ringing )

01:18.879 --> 01:22.816
( footsteps )

01:22.916 --> 01:25.386
PAUL.

01:32.025 --> 01:33.994
DO YOU WANT
TO GET THAT?

01:34.094 --> 01:36.464
( theme music playing )

02:06.460 --> 02:09.297
I'M SORRY ABOUT
THE PHONE BUSINESS.

02:09.397 --> 02:11.532
I'M TRYING TO GET MY
FATHER'S ESTATE SETTLED,

02:11.632 --> 02:15.002
AND I CAN'T EVEN GET
ANYBODY TO TALK TO ME.

02:15.102 --> 02:18.138
ALL I GET IS,
"CAN YOU HOLD? PLEASE HOLD.
LET ME PUT YOU ON HOLD."

02:18.239 --> 02:20.608
THAT'S SO IRRITATING.

02:20.708 --> 02:24.512
IF I BELIEVED THE OPERATORS
WERE ACTUALLY HELPING SOMEBODY,
I WOULD WAIT.

02:26.214 --> 02:29.983
SOMETIMES I THINK
THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS ON HOLD.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.985
NOBODY IS
BEING HELPED.

02:32.085 --> 02:34.188
THEY DON'T EVEN
CALL IT "HELP" ANY MORE.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.224
THEY CALL IT
"CUSTOMER SUPPORT."

02:36.324 --> 02:39.360
THAT'S 'CAUSE ALL THEY
REALLY DO IS SAY,

02:39.460 --> 02:41.529
"I'M SORRY YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.
THAT'S TOO BAD."

02:41.629 --> 02:43.364
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T WANT SUPPORT.

02:43.464 --> 02:46.900
I WANT YOUR HELP.
SO I HANG UP.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.871
IS THERE SOMETHING
I CAN HELP YOU WITH?

02:55.142 --> 02:58.178
NO.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.914
UNLESS YOU WANT TO PROOFREAD
A LETTER I WROTE.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.884
SURE.
WHAT KIND OF LETTER?

03:03.984 --> 03:06.620
REMEMBER LAST WEEK
I LEFT HERE

03:06.720 --> 03:08.756
AND I WENT TO MEET
WITH ALEX'S FATHER?

03:08.856 --> 03:10.524
YEAH, HOW DID THAT GO?

03:10.624 --> 03:12.626
DISORIENTING.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.429
HE OFFERED TO ACCEPT

03:15.529 --> 03:18.832
SETTLEMENT MONEY
FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY

03:18.932 --> 03:22.069
AND DROP HIS LAWSUIT
AGAINST ME--

03:22.169 --> 03:23.904
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

03:24.004 --> 03:27.308
--IN EXCHANGE
FOR A LETTER FROM ME

03:27.408 --> 03:31.812
ADMITTING MY GUILT
IN ALEX'S DEATH.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.619
YOU WROTE THE LETTER?

03:38.719 --> 03:41.322
WHAT WOULD HE DO
WITH THIS LETTER?

03:41.422 --> 03:44.191
HE GAVE ME HIS WORD
HE WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING WITH IT.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.493
PAUL.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.595
I KNOW. YOU'RE RIGHT.
ONCE HE HAS IT,

03:47.695 --> 03:49.797
TECHNICALLY HE CAN DO
ANYTHING HE WANTS WITH IT--

03:49.897 --> 03:52.633
SEND IT TO THE ETHICS BOARD
OR POST IT ONLINE.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.303
THAT WOULD BE THE END
OF YOUR CAREER.

03:56.470 --> 03:57.905
WHAT DID
YOUR LAWYER SAY?

03:58.005 --> 04:00.408
HE SAYS THE LETTER WILL
PUT AN END TO THE LAWSUIT

04:00.508 --> 04:03.110
AND THAT MY INSURANCE WILL
COVER THE WHOLE SETTLEMENT.

04:03.210 --> 04:05.112
I WON'T END UP
OWING A THING.

04:05.212 --> 04:07.114
WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU DON'T SEND IT?

04:07.214 --> 04:09.116
THEY HAVE A PRELIMINARY
HEARING NEXT WEEK.

04:09.216 --> 04:12.620
THE JUDGE,
I MEAN, HE COULD JUST
THROW THE WHOLE CASE OUT.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.022
BUT IF HE DOESN'T, IT MIGHT
GO TO TRIAL WITH A JURY,

04:15.122 --> 04:17.925
IN WHICH CASE
I WILL LOSE BIG TIME.

04:18.025 --> 04:19.427
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

04:19.527 --> 04:22.330
THE LAWYER SAYS
THAT'S WHAT JURIES DO.

04:22.430 --> 04:26.667
HE SAYS EVERYBODY
HATES THERAPISTS.

04:28.201 --> 04:30.571
THEY DO?

04:30.671 --> 04:34.308
ACCORDING TO THIS GUY,
THERAPY IS BULLSHIT.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.444
HE SAYS PEOPLE
GO INTO TREATMENT

04:36.544 --> 04:38.579
HOPING THAT THE THERAPIST
IS GONNA FIX THEM,

04:38.679 --> 04:41.849
BUT THAT THERAPISTS EITHER
DON'T SOLVE PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS

04:41.949 --> 04:43.484
OR THEY MAKE THEM WORSE.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.218
AND THIS MAN IS
REPRESENTING YOU?

04:45.319 --> 04:47.154
HE FIGHTS CASES LIKE THIS
EVERY WEEK.

04:47.254 --> 04:49.222
HE KNOWS HOW THEY GO.

04:49.323 --> 04:51.992
AND HE'S WORRIED THAT
THE JURY IS GONNA SEE ME

04:52.092 --> 04:54.728
AS A STAND-IN FOR ALL THE BAD
THERAPISTS IN THE WORLD,

04:54.828 --> 04:58.366
AND AWARD ALEX'S FATHER
THE ENTIRE $20 MILLION.

04:58.466 --> 05:00.000
IF THIS LAWYER KNEW
WHAT HE WAS DOING,

05:00.100 --> 05:03.704
HE'D GET THE JURY TO SEE
WHAT A GOOD THERAPIST YOU ARE.

05:03.804 --> 05:07.575
EXCUSE ME FOR A SECOND, GINA.
I'M JUST CURIOUS--

05:07.675 --> 05:10.478
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
IF YOU WERE ON TRIAL

05:10.578 --> 05:13.547
AND THE LAWYER ASKED YOU,
"WHAT PERCENTAGE
OF YOUR PATIENTS

05:13.647 --> 05:15.416
DO YOU THINK
YOU'VE REALLY HELPED?"

05:15.516 --> 05:17.050
WHAT ARE YOU ASKING?

05:17.150 --> 05:19.753
WOULD YOU SAY, ON AVERAGE,
THAT THE PEOPLE YOU'VE TREATED

05:19.853 --> 05:21.655
HAVE GOTTEN A LITTLE BETTER,
A LOT BETTER,

05:21.755 --> 05:23.524
OR THEY'VE STAYED
ABOUT THE SAME?

05:23.624 --> 05:25.726
YOU'RE SOMEONE I TREAT.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.362
ARE YOU ASKING ME IF I'LL
HELP YOU GET BETTER?

05:28.462 --> 05:30.598
OKAY, FINE, DON'T ANSWER
THE QUESTION.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.766
THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU ANYWAY.
THIS IS ABOUT ME.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.669
THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT IT IS
I'M NOT HELPING ANYBODY.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.506
YOU KNOW? I'M GOING
TO MAIL THIS LETTER

05:38.606 --> 05:40.574
AND I'M GOING TO QUIT
BEING A THERAPIST

05:40.674 --> 05:42.776
AND FIND SOMETHING BETTER
TO DO, SOMETHING USEFUL.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.812
PAUL, YOU KNOW
YOU HELP PEOPLE.

05:44.912 --> 05:46.914
YOU KNOW WHAT I DO?
MOST DAYS I SIT THERE

05:47.014 --> 05:49.249
AND I LISTEN
FOR 45 MINUTES.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.284
THEN MY PATIENTS
GO OUT THE DOOR

05:51.385 --> 05:53.521
AND DO WHATEVER THEY WERE
GOING TO DO ANYWAY.

05:53.621 --> 05:56.424
PAUL, YOU DON'T
JUST LISTEN.

05:56.524 --> 05:59.126
YOU MAKE OBSERVATIONS.
YOU ASK QUESTIONS.

05:59.226 --> 06:01.128
YOU MAKE INTERPRETATIONS.

06:01.228 --> 06:05.032
YOU ENCOURAGE PEOPLE
TO LOOK AT THE PATTERNS
OF THEIR BEHAVIOR.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.935
THAT MAY BE WHAT I DO,
BUT IT'S NOT WHAT PEOPLE WANT.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.237
AND WHAT DO THEY WANT?

06:10.337 --> 06:12.940
THEY WANT TO BE LOVED,
EVEN BY ME.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.108
THEY WANT A CHILD,
OR THEY WANT TO BE MY CHILD.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.244
THEY WANT A PARENT
WHO LOVES THEM.

06:17.344 --> 06:19.146
THEY WANT ATTENTION.
THEY WANT AFFECTION.

06:19.246 --> 06:20.948
THEY WANT HOPE.
THEY WANT PILLS.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.883
AND THEY WANT SEX.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.918
IT'S A GOOD LIST.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.955
BUT I DON'T GIVE THEM
THOSE THINGS.

06:29.523 --> 06:33.226
MY PATIENT, MIA,
THE LAWYER--

06:33.326 --> 06:35.228
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT SHE WANTS?

06:35.328 --> 06:38.298
SHE WANTS ME TO HOLD HER,
TO COMFORT HER.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.602
BUT WHAT SHE REALLY NEEDS
IS A GOOD HUSBAND
AND A FAMILY.

06:41.702 --> 06:45.005
AND I KNOW THAT I CANNOT
GIVE HER THOSE THINGS.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.707
ALL I CAN DO
IS SHOW HER

06:46.807 --> 06:48.876
THAT SHE PUSHES AWAY
THE VERY PEOPLE
WHO COULD HELP HER

06:48.976 --> 06:51.111
AND THAT SHE PULLS
ON THE PEOPLE WHO WON'T.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.546
BUT THAT ONLY LEAVES HER

06:52.646 --> 06:54.748
FEELING MORE LONELY
AND UNLOVED.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.750
YOU KNOW, BY THE TIME
SHE LEFT ON MONDAY,

06:56.850 --> 07:00.320
BY THE TIME
SHE LEFT MY OFFICE,
SHE FELT DOOMED,

07:00.420 --> 07:03.557
REJECTED BY HER FAMILY
AND THE WORLD.

07:03.657 --> 07:07.795
AND I HAD ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING TO SAY TO HER.

07:07.895 --> 07:11.098
SO YOU'RE WORRIED
SHE WON'T COME BACK?

07:11.198 --> 07:13.601
WHY SHOULD SHE
COME BACK, REALLY?

07:13.701 --> 07:16.770
I AM OF NO USE
TO HER WHATSOEVER.

07:16.870 --> 07:20.273
ALL THIS BIG WISDOM THAT
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE GIVING HER--

07:20.373 --> 07:21.975
THIS ISN'T GOING
TO MAKE HER HAPPY.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.344
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO--
MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY?

07:24.444 --> 07:27.748
ABSOLUTELY, I WANT
TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.518
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO,
FUCK THEM UP EVEN MORE?

07:32.953 --> 07:35.689
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO?
I'M GONNA MAIL THIS LETTER

07:35.789 --> 07:37.725
AND I'M GONNA LET THEM
TAKE MY LICENSE,

07:37.825 --> 07:41.294
AND I'M GONNA BECOME
A LIFE COACH.

07:41.394 --> 07:44.331
A LIFE COACH?
WHAT DO THEY DO?

07:44.431 --> 07:46.266
YOU KNOW WHAT
A LIFE COACH IS.

07:46.366 --> 07:49.336
THEY GIVE ADVICE.
IT'S NOT--

07:49.436 --> 07:53.440
LOOK, PEOPLE DON'T
HAVE FAMILIES ANYMORE
THAT THEY CAN TALK TO,

07:53.541 --> 07:56.744
AND FRIENDS ARE QUICKLY
GOING THE WAY OF FAMILIES.

07:56.844 --> 08:00.213
SO IF YOU WERE MIA'S
LIFE COACH,

08:00.313 --> 08:01.782
WHAT WOULD YOU
TELL HER TO DO?

08:01.882 --> 08:03.784
I WOULD TELL HER
TO QUIT HER JOB.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.553
I WOULD TELL HER
TO GROW HER HAIR,

08:05.653 --> 08:08.822
I WOULD TELL HER TO MOVE
SOMEWHERE WHERE SHE'S
OUTSIDE IN THE SUNSHINE,

08:08.922 --> 08:10.924
LIKE NAPA VALLEY.
I WOULD TELL HER

08:11.024 --> 08:13.761
TO TAKE UP BIKING,
NOT WEAR HEELS FOR A YEAR.

08:13.861 --> 08:17.264
AND I'D TELL HER,
"GET A DOG."

08:19.533 --> 08:22.035
DO YOU THINK THAT SHE
WOULD TAKE YOUR ADVICE?

08:22.135 --> 08:26.774
SHE JUST WANTS ME
TO GIVE HER LOVE AND SUPPORT.

08:26.874 --> 08:31.378
BUT IF SHE WERE CAPABLE
OF RECEIVING LOVE AND SUPPORT,

08:31.478 --> 08:33.513
SHE WOULDN'T BE COMING
TO YOU FOR THEM.

08:33.614 --> 08:36.784
THAT'S HER REAL PROBLEM.
AND UNTIL IT'S TREATED,

08:36.884 --> 08:39.620
SHE WON'T BE ABLE TO TAKE
ANYONE'S ADVICE.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.655
AND THAT'S WHY
SHE NEEDS THERAPY.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.791
ACTUALLY, I THINK
IF MY FIRST ADVICE WORKED,

08:43.891 --> 08:45.793
SHE MIGHT TRY
SOME OTHER NEW IDEA.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.629
IF MY ADVICE DIDN'T WORK OUT,
SHE'D GO IN ANOTHER DIRECTION.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.530
I DON'T SEE
WHAT THE HARM IS.

08:50.631 --> 08:53.300
WOULD YOU WANT
THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAKING
HER DECISIONS FOR HER?

08:53.400 --> 08:55.168
I THINK I'D BE FINE
WITH THAT.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.337
YOU SEE, THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM
RIGHT THERE, GINA.

08:57.437 --> 09:00.708
YOU'RE SCARED OF TAKING
RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR
PATIENTS' LIVES.

09:00.808 --> 09:03.611
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY WANT
TO GET INVOLVED WITH THEM.

09:03.711 --> 09:07.480
I DO. SO YOU STILL
CLING TO THIS DOGMA

09:07.581 --> 09:09.416
OF LETTING THEM MAKE
THEIR OWN DECISIONS.

09:09.516 --> 09:13.353
BUT THAT, IN MY OPINION--
THAT'S NOT PROFESSIONALISM.
THAT'S COWARDICE.

09:13.453 --> 09:17.424
IT'S NOT DOGMA, PAUL.

09:17.524 --> 09:21.061
IT'S A BASIC TENET
OF OUR PROFESSION.

09:21.161 --> 09:24.497
IF YOU TAKE ACTION
IN YOUR PATIENTS' LIVES,

09:24.598 --> 09:27.334
YOU CAUSE THEM TO BECOME
DEPENDENT ON YOU.

09:27.434 --> 09:29.169
YOU CRIPPLE THEM.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.571
OH, BACK ON THE HIGH
MORAL GROUND AGAIN, AS USUAL.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.140
BUT YOU'VE
GOT IT WRONG, GINA.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.643
MY PROBLEM ISN'T THAT
I CAN'T OBEY THE RULES.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.477
MY PROBLEM IS THAT,
UNLIKE YOU,

09:37.577 --> 09:40.413
I ACTUALLY GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT MY PATIENTS.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.515
YOU THINK I DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOU?

09:42.616 --> 09:45.252
YOU DON'T LET YOURSELF
CARE ABOUT ANYBODY.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.855
YOU'RE TOO AFRAID TO.
YOU SIT IN THAT GODDAMN CHAIR,

09:47.955 --> 09:50.490
AND YOUR PATIENTS ARE
FALLING APART IN FRONT OF YOU,

09:50.590 --> 09:52.626
BUT INSTEAD OF
REACHING OUT TO HELP,

09:52.726 --> 09:55.729
YOU STUDY THEM AS IF
THEY WERE PIECES OF A PUZZLE.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.668
WELL, I LET YOU DOWN.

10:00.768 --> 10:03.871
AND YOU'RE ENRAGED AT ME.

10:03.971 --> 10:06.406
I WAS YOUR TEACHER.
I WAS YOUR MENTOR.

10:06.506 --> 10:09.176
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO GIVE YOU THE WISDOM

10:09.276 --> 10:12.379
THAT WOULD PROTECT YOU
FROM THIS SORT OF PAIN--

10:12.479 --> 10:14.547
THE PAIN YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH NOW.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.516
AND I DIDN'T.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.518
AND SO YOU'RE REACTING
BY TELLING ME

10:18.618 --> 10:20.487
THAT I'M NOT FEELING
YOUR PAIN,

10:20.587 --> 10:22.255
AND THAT MY PROFESSION
IS USELESS.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.124
OH, WE BOTH KNOW

10:24.224 --> 10:26.393
THAT YOU DON'T BELIEVE
A WORD OF THAT BULLSHIT.

10:26.493 --> 10:29.062
IF ANYTHING, YOU THINK
THAT I'VE DISAPPOINTED YOU.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.898
YOU KEEP TELLING ME
I'M A GOOD PERSON--

10:30.998 --> 10:32.565
"OH, YOU'RE A GREAT
THERAPIST, PAUL."

10:32.666 --> 10:35.703
BUT WE BOTH KNOW HOW LITTLE
RESPECT YOU REALLY HAVE FOR ME.

10:35.803 --> 10:38.238
YOU PRETEND TO BE NEUTRAL,
BUT YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING

10:38.338 --> 10:41.775
BUT JUDGE ME SINCE THE MINUTE
I CAME BACK INTO THERAPY.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.177
SO YOU THINK I'VE BEEN
JUDGING YOU ALL THIS TIME?

10:44.277 --> 10:47.480
OH, FOR FUCK'S SAKE,
STOP MIRRORING WHAT I SAY.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.482
WOULD YOU STOP HIDING
BEHIND THE CLOAK,

10:49.582 --> 10:51.484
DROP THE FUCKING
CATLIKE SMILE,

10:51.584 --> 10:53.921
THE BULLSHIT
BUDDHA POSE OF YOURS,

10:54.021 --> 10:57.390
AND JUST TELL ME FOR ONCE
WHAT YOU REALLY THINK?

10:59.592 --> 11:03.530
WHAT DO I REALLY THINK?

11:03.630 --> 11:05.498
I REALLY THINK

11:05.598 --> 11:08.068
THAT YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE AN ASSHOLE.

11:08.168 --> 11:11.604
I REALLY THINK
THAT YOU'RE A THERAPIST

11:11.705 --> 11:14.407
WHO HAS REMARKABLY
LITTLE INSIGHT

11:14.507 --> 11:16.944
INTO YOUR OWN BEHAVIOR.

11:17.044 --> 11:20.714
YOU ARE SO SELF-ABSORBED.
YOU ARE SO ENTITLED.

11:20.814 --> 11:23.183
YOU COME IN HERE
AND YOU SPOUT

11:23.283 --> 11:25.919
THE SAME OLD BULLSHIT!

11:26.019 --> 11:29.589
"I WANT TO CROSS
THE BOUNDARIES

11:29.689 --> 11:32.459
BECAUSE I CARE SO MUCH!"

11:32.559 --> 11:35.062
AND I HAVE TO SIT HERE
AND LISTEN.

11:35.162 --> 11:37.931
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE GALL
TO GET MAD AT ME

11:38.031 --> 11:40.133
FOR NOT LOSING
MY TEMPER!

11:40.233 --> 11:42.535
WELL, AT LEAST
I FINALLY KNOW.

11:42.635 --> 11:43.871
YOU KNOW NOTHING.

11:43.971 --> 11:46.406
THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M A SELF-ABSORBED ASSHOLE

11:46.506 --> 11:48.141
AND YOU'RE
FURIOUS AT ME.

11:48.241 --> 11:49.877
I AM FURIOUS AT YOU.

11:49.977 --> 11:53.280
LET ME ASK YOU--
HOW DID SAYING THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL?

11:53.380 --> 11:55.315
IT FELT GOOD.

11:58.786 --> 12:02.055
BUT MAYBE THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANTED.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.657
AND WHAT DID I WANT, GINA?
YOU TELL ME.

12:04.758 --> 12:07.895
YOU GOT ME TO PLAY
THE ROLE YOU RELISH.

12:07.995 --> 12:11.031
YOU GOT ME
TO BE THE PUNISHING,
REJECTING PARENT,

12:11.131 --> 12:13.967
THE FAILED AUTHORITY FIGURE
THAT YOU CAN RAIL AGAINST.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.004
- WHY WOULD I WANT THAT?
- BECAUSE IT'S FAMILIAR.

12:17.104 --> 12:21.374
IT CONFIRMS
YOUR WORLDVIEW.

12:21.474 --> 12:25.512
YOU GET TO BE THE INNOCENT
VICTIM DOING YOUR BEST.

12:25.612 --> 12:28.415
AND I'M
JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.
I'M OUT TO FUCK YOU OVER.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.250
SO YOU CALL ME
AN ASSHOLE,

12:30.350 --> 12:33.787
AND NOT ONLY IS IT MY FAULT,
IT'S ACTUALLY WHAT I WANTED.

12:33.887 --> 12:36.556
( exhales )

12:36.656 --> 12:38.391
YOU TELL ME--
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

12:38.491 --> 12:40.360
GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK.

12:40.460 --> 12:41.929
I BET YOU FEEL GOOD.

12:42.029 --> 12:44.564
LET'S FACE IT, PAUL--

12:44.664 --> 12:47.167
YOU'D ALWAYS RATHER
YELL THAN THINK.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.469
WHAT DON'T I WANT
TO THINK ABOUT?

12:51.138 --> 12:54.407
WELL, YOU'RE
ON A TEAR HERE.

12:54.507 --> 12:57.377
YOU'RE TORTURED BY WHAT
YOU SEE AS YOUR FAILURES

12:57.477 --> 13:00.347
WITH YOUR PARENTS,
WITH YOUR PATIENTS,
WITH YOUR FATHER.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.851
SO YOU'RE DESTROYING
ALL YOUR CAREFUL WORK,

13:03.951 --> 13:05.685
- AND MINE.
- CAREFUL WORK?

13:05.785 --> 13:09.489
YOU THINK I'M UNPROFESSIONAL.
YOU THINK I'VE GOT
NO BOUNDARIES.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.324
YOU'VE ALWAYS
THOUGHT THAT.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.093
HAVE I?
HUH.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.762
HAVE I ALWAYS
THOUGHT THAT?

13:15.863 --> 13:18.131
THEN WHY DO YOU THINK

13:18.231 --> 13:21.201
I'VE STUCK BY YOU
ALL THESE YEARS,

13:21.301 --> 13:24.972
EVEN WHEN YOU'VE BEEN
A COMPLETE PAIN
IN THE ASS?

13:26.273 --> 13:30.878
THE TRUTH IS,
DESPITE EVERYTHING,

13:30.978 --> 13:33.780
I REALLY DO THINK
YOU'RE A GOOD THERAPIST.

13:33.881 --> 13:37.450
YOU TELL ME YOU'RE
NO HELP TO YOUR PATIENTS,

13:37.550 --> 13:40.120
BUT WHEN YOU DESCRIBE THEM,
IT'S CLEAR TO ME

13:40.220 --> 13:42.990
HOW CAREFULLY YOU LISTEN.

13:43.090 --> 13:45.926
YOU HAVE A GREAT EAR.

13:46.026 --> 13:48.528
YOU HAVE A GREAT
SENSE OF EMPATHY.

14:22.829 --> 14:26.967
THEN WHY AM I
FAILING THEM?

14:27.067 --> 14:30.303
IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU, PAUL.

14:30.403 --> 14:34.274
YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE HUMAN BEINGS.

14:34.374 --> 14:38.111
THEY'RE STRUGGLING
WITH PROFOUND PROBLEMS.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.180
IF ONLY YOU COULD
FIND COURAGE

14:40.280 --> 14:42.482
TO SIT WITH THE FACT
THAT WHAT WE DO IS HARD

14:42.582 --> 14:46.686
AND SOMETIMES IT MAKES YOU
FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT.

14:46.786 --> 14:49.756
IT'S A HUMBLING
PROFESSION.

14:49.856 --> 14:52.825
AND IF YOU LACK ANYTHING
AS A THERAPIST,

14:52.926 --> 14:55.528
IT'S HUMILITY.

14:55.628 --> 14:58.198
SOMEHOW YOU HAVE TO LEARN
TO TOLERATE THE FACT

14:58.298 --> 15:02.469
THAT WE DON'T SAVE PEOPLE.
WE CAN'T.

15:08.008 --> 15:10.343
( sighs )

15:13.780 --> 15:17.250
WALTER TRIED
TO KILL HIMSELF.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.254
OH MY GOD.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.156
PAUL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME THIS?

15:23.256 --> 15:25.392
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

15:25.492 --> 15:28.495
ABOUT 10 DAYS AGO.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.730
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
MENTION IT LAST WEEK.

15:30.830 --> 15:33.566
I FELT THERE WAS ENOUGH
TO TALK ABOUT,

15:33.666 --> 15:36.403
WITH MY FATHER.

15:36.503 --> 15:41.008
I MEAN, WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE
IF HE HAD SUCCEEDED?

15:41.108 --> 15:43.243
YOU WOULD HAVE
BLAMED YOURSELF,

15:43.343 --> 15:45.112
JUST LIKE YOU DID
WITH ALEX.

15:45.212 --> 15:47.947
BUT I AM RESPONSIBLE
FOR WHAT HAPPENED.

15:48.048 --> 15:52.719
PAUL, IN TWO WEEKS
YOU'VE LOST YOUR FATHER--

15:52.819 --> 15:55.955
YOU'RE WRACKED WITH GUILT
BECAUSE YOU FEEL YOU
NEGLECTED HIM--

15:56.056 --> 15:58.758
AND NOW THIS.

15:58.858 --> 16:00.994
THE SESSIONS
WITH HIM ARE--

16:01.094 --> 16:03.630
THE FIRST ONE
WAS IN THE HOSPITAL.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.832
YOU CAN IMAGINE
THAT THAT'S--

16:05.932 --> 16:08.268
THAT'S THE LAST PLACE
I WANT TO BE RIGHT NOW.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.703
I WAS SITTING WITH HIM,
WORRYING

16:10.803 --> 16:12.539
THAT IF I JUST SAID
THE WRONG THING--

16:12.639 --> 16:15.108
JUST ONE WRONG THING--

16:15.208 --> 16:18.445
AND HIS DAUGHTER IS OUTSIDE
IN THE CORRIDOR, WAITING.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.413
AND SHE'S JUST--

16:20.513 --> 16:22.482
SHE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT
OLDER THAN ROSIE.

16:22.582 --> 16:25.318
AND SHE'S BEEN HOLDING
THAT FAMILY TOGETHER--

16:25.418 --> 16:27.687
THE MOTHER AND THE FATHER--
IN A WAY THAT--

16:30.257 --> 16:33.860
JUST IN THE WAY THAT...

16:33.960 --> 16:37.197
...YOU TRIED TO SAVE
YOUR MOTHER?

16:37.297 --> 16:40.533
YEAH.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.869
AND SHE'S STARING AT ME
WITH THOSE EYES

16:42.969 --> 16:44.904
THAT WOULD
BREAK YOUR HEART.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.174
SHE'S JUST STARTING
TO LIVE HER LIFE.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.776
AND ALL I WANT TO SAY TO HER
IS, "GET OUT, RUN AWAY."

16:49.876 --> 16:51.744
BUT I CAN'T DO THAT,

16:51.844 --> 16:56.183
BECAUSE IF SHE GOES,
SO DOES WALTER.

16:56.283 --> 16:59.286
I'VE SAT WITH HIM FOR HOURS,
TRYING TO TELL HIM

16:59.386 --> 17:01.354
THAT HIS LIFE
CAN STILL HAVE MEANING;

17:01.454 --> 17:03.390
THAT EVEN THOUGH
HE'S OVERWHELMED

17:03.490 --> 17:06.093
WITH GUILT AND LOSS
AND SHAME,

17:06.193 --> 17:07.927
HE HAS TO PUSH ON;

17:08.027 --> 17:11.264
THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT LIFE MIGHT HAVE
IN STORE FOR HIM,

17:11.364 --> 17:14.033
WHAT HIS THIRD ACT
COULD BE.

17:16.035 --> 17:19.139
EXCEPT HE KNOWS--
HE KNOWS DAMN WELL

17:19.239 --> 17:22.575
WHAT HIS THIRD ACT
IS GOING TO BE--

17:22.675 --> 17:27.013
A LONG, STEADY DECLINE,

17:27.114 --> 17:29.249
JUST LIKE MY FATHER'S.

17:30.217 --> 17:34.254
SO MAYBE HE'S RIGHT

17:34.354 --> 17:38.291
TO TRY FOR
A MILLIONAIRE'S DEATH,
AS HE CALLS IT,

17:38.391 --> 17:42.095
TO TAKE CONTROL FOR HIMSELF,
ON HIS TERMS,

17:42.195 --> 17:43.930
INSTEAD OF LETTING
THE UNIVERSE

17:44.030 --> 17:49.102
CONTINUE TO TORTURE HIM.

17:50.137 --> 17:52.572
DO YOU REALLY
BELIEVE THAT?

17:54.107 --> 17:57.444
I CAN SEE
HOW HE GOT THERE,

17:57.544 --> 18:00.480
HOW SOMEBODY WOULD JUST
WANT TO CLOSE THEIR EYES

18:00.580 --> 18:03.816
AND NOT WAKE UP.

18:07.820 --> 18:11.524
HAVE YOU BEEN THINKING
YOU MIGHT LIKE TO JUST
GO TO SLEEP YOURSELF?

18:13.526 --> 18:15.495
NO NO.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.097
BUT I HAVEN'T LOST
EVERYTHING I EVER WANTED.

18:18.198 --> 18:21.568
- IF I DID--
- IF YOU DID?

18:25.538 --> 18:27.474
I'M NOT GOING
TO KILL MYSELF, GINA.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.041
TELL ME WHY NOT.

18:29.142 --> 18:30.877
OH, FOR FUCK'S SAKE.

18:30.977 --> 18:32.745
PAUL, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M ASKING YOU.

18:32.845 --> 18:33.813
YOU'RE VULNERABLE HERE.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.448
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY, GINA.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.217
I HAVE CHILDREN.

18:42.555 --> 18:47.294
I REMEMBER, YOU KNOW,
AFTER MY MOTHER DIED,

18:47.394 --> 18:50.129
I WAS STANDING ABOVE HER GRAVE
AND I PROMISED MYSELF

18:50.230 --> 18:52.732
THAT I WOULD NEVER EVER
DO THAT

18:52.832 --> 18:57.003
TO ONE OF MY KIDS.

18:57.103 --> 19:01.007
AND THEN IAN WAS BORN,
AND THEN ROSIE AND MAX.

19:01.107 --> 19:03.310
I MADE THE SAME PROMISE
TO MYSELF

19:03.410 --> 19:05.812
OVER AND OVER
AND OVER AGAIN.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.780
AND I FELT THIS RUSH

19:07.880 --> 19:11.484
OF WARMTH
THROUGH MY BODY--

19:11.584 --> 19:13.520
"I AM GOOD.

19:13.620 --> 19:16.055
I AM STRONG."

19:16.155 --> 19:19.659
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE
I'M THIS GREAT TREE,

19:19.759 --> 19:23.129
GIANT, POWERFUL,

19:23.230 --> 19:25.164
AND THEY'RE GONNA LIVE
THEIR WHOLE LIVES

19:25.265 --> 19:29.769
BENEATH MY SHADE.

19:29.869 --> 19:34.441
AND THEN
SOMETIMES I FEEL--

19:34.541 --> 19:37.477
I FEEL LIKE ALL MY LEAVES
HAVE JUST FALLEN AWAY...

19:39.312 --> 19:43.916
AND I CAN'T DO
ANYTHING FOR THEM

19:44.016 --> 19:48.421
EXCEPT BLOCK THE VIEW.

19:50.457 --> 19:52.359
THEY STILL NEED YOU.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.461
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.062
THEY DO.

19:56.162 --> 19:58.698
YOU STILL NEED
YOUR MOTHER,
DON'T YOU?

20:01.901 --> 20:04.304
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

20:04.404 --> 20:07.607
SHE'D BE 80 BY NOW.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.910
SHE'D HAVE GOT TO SEE
HER GRANDKIDS GROW UP.

20:12.779 --> 20:15.114
DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD HAVE
MADE HER HAPPIER?

20:15.214 --> 20:17.717
YES.

20:25.425 --> 20:26.926
CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING, GINA?

20:27.026 --> 20:29.061
SURE.

20:29.161 --> 20:33.966
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT
ABOUT SUICIDE?

20:34.834 --> 20:37.937
YES.

20:39.171 --> 20:42.275
WHEN DAVID WAS DYING?

20:42.375 --> 20:44.777
OH, NO NO, NOT WHEN
DAVID WAS DYING.

20:44.877 --> 20:49.749
BUT AFTERWARDS,
WHEN YOU WERE GRIEVING?

20:51.884 --> 20:54.421
HE WAS A YOUNG MAN--

20:54.521 --> 20:57.189
HE WAS SO YOUNG
WHEN HE GOT CANCER

20:57.290 --> 21:01.127
AND HIS LIFE WAS
STOLEN FROM HIM.

21:01.227 --> 21:03.296
AND YOU WATCH
SOMEONE DIE--

21:03.396 --> 21:05.665
SOMEONE WHO WANTS
TO LIVE AND--

21:07.667 --> 21:10.036
YEAH.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.441
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T MAKE IT
TO DAVID'S FUNERAL.

21:14.541 --> 21:18.545
SORRY I WASN'T
THERE FOR YOU.

21:22.148 --> 21:23.783
THANK YOU.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.762
AND WHAT ABOUT
YOUR PATIENT
WITH CANCER?

21:35.862 --> 21:37.497
HOW'S SHE DOING?

21:37.597 --> 21:42.335
SHE GETS THE RESULT
OF THE BLOOD TEST THIS WEEK.

21:42.435 --> 21:43.970
HOW IS SHE DOING
EMOTIONALLY?

21:44.070 --> 21:46.272
SHE'S KIND
OF FURIOUS AT ME.

21:46.373 --> 21:48.240
WHY?

21:48.341 --> 21:51.478
IT'S A LONG STORY.
SHE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL.

21:51.578 --> 21:54.313
SHE WAS REALLY REALLY SICK,
BUT SHE HADN'T TOLD HER MOTHER.

21:54.414 --> 21:57.517
SO I THOUGHT THAT HER MOTHER
DESERVED TO KNOW.

21:57.617 --> 22:01.320
OF COURSE SHE DID.
YOU WERE RIGHT.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.890
SOMEDAY APRIL
WILL THANK YOU.

22:03.990 --> 22:06.359
MAYBE.

22:12.098 --> 22:14.434
( exhales )

22:14.534 --> 22:18.270
LISTEN, GINA,
I'M EXHAUSTED.

22:18.371 --> 22:21.307
( laughs )

22:21.408 --> 22:23.843
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ANYMORE.

22:23.943 --> 22:27.547
I THINK I'LL GO GET
A COFFEE OR SOMETHING

22:27.647 --> 22:29.248
BEFORE I PICK UP
THE KIDS.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.183
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

22:31.283 --> 22:32.685
NO NO NO, IT'S OKAY.
I'M FINE.

22:32.785 --> 22:36.723
I'M JUST TIRED,
THAT'S ALL.

22:39.492 --> 22:41.027
OH, I FORGOT
MY LETTER.

22:41.127 --> 22:43.062
OH, I'LL KEEP THIS--

22:43.162 --> 22:46.232
I'LL KEEP THIS,
YOU KNOW, FOR YOU.

22:46.332 --> 22:48.267
AND THEN YOU TAKE
THIS WEEK,

22:48.367 --> 22:50.036
YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

22:50.136 --> 22:52.539
AND IF YOU WANT IT BACK,
IF YOU WANT TO SEND IT,

22:52.639 --> 22:54.206
I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU.

22:54.306 --> 22:58.277
TAKE A WEEK TO DO WHAT?

22:58.377 --> 23:01.448
TO SEE YOUR PATIENTS.

23:01.548 --> 23:04.417
( sighs )
GINA, THAT'S WHAT
I'VE BEEN SAYING--

23:04.517 --> 23:07.520
I DON'T WANT
TO SEE MY PATIENTS.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.922
SEE YOUR PATIENTS, PAUL.

23:10.022 --> 23:13.593
ACT AS IF YOU BELIEVE
YOU'RE HELPING.

23:21.501 --> 23:24.003
( theme music playing )
