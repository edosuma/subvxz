10:47.200 --> 10:49.200
WELL, THE LIBERTY BELL
IS SAFE FOR ANOTHER DAY.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.900
THE ENEMY MANAGED
TO PUT A CRACK IN IT
WHILE MY BACK WAS TURNED,

10:51.900 --> 10:55.567
BUT I SPACKLED THAT PUPPY
RIGHT BACK UP.

10:57.567 --> 10:59.500

WHAT DO YOU GOT?

19:26.233 --> 19:28.467

GOING TO STAND HERE--

19:34.900 --> 19:36.567
WH-WHERE AM I?
THE LAST THING I REMEMBER,

19:36.567 --> 19:38.367
I WAS CLIMBING OUT
OF A FOXHOLE TO SEE YOU,

19:38.367 --> 19:41.667
AND THEN--OH, MY GOSH,
I'M IN HEAVEN.

19:41.667 --> 19:42.800
CORY, YOU'RE ALIVE.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.600

LOST YOUR MEMORY.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.467
YEAH, BUT WHAT ABOUT SHAWN?
WHAT ABOUT THE PROMISE?

19:47.467 --> 19:49.867
CORY, I COULD NEVER BE
WITH ANYBODY ELSE.

19:49.867 --> 19:51.300
ALL THOSE THINGS
I'D EVER DREAMED ABOUT--

19:51.300 --> 19:54.834
A HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY,
KIDS PLAYING
IN THE YARD--

19:54.834 --> 19:57.767
THEY MEAN NOTHING TO ME
UNLESS THEY'RE WITH YOU.

19:57.767 --> 19:59.000
ME, TOO.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.400
WELL, I TOLD YOU
I'D COME BACK.

20:01.400 --> 20:04.834
I FOUND YOU,
YOU BIG LUG.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.900
SO CORY, NOW THAT THE WAR'S
OVER, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
ABOUT TOPANGA?

20:14.900 --> 20:17.400
I'M GOING TO POP
THE QUESTION
ALL OVER AGAIN.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.934
YOU GOT MOXIE, KID.

20:19.934 --> 20:22.100
SHE'S GOTTA KNOW THAT
I REALLY DO CARE ABOUT HER.

20:22.100 --> 20:25.800
AND I'M NOT JUST ASKING
BECAUSE OF SOME CRAZY WAR.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.600
TOPANGA?

20:31.600 --> 20:33.400
YEAH?

20:33.400 --> 20:34.667
THERE'S SOMETHING I REALLY
NEED TO ASK YOU.

20:39.834 --> 20:41.734
CORY, YOU WERE GOING
TO ASK ME SOMETHING?

20:41.734 --> 20:43.367
I FOUND THIS
REALLY COOL SIREN RING

20:43.367 --> 20:44.867
IN MY CRACKER JACK BOX.

20:44.867 --> 20:46.200
WOULD YOU LIKE IT?

20:46.200 --> 20:47.700
THANKS!

20:47.700 --> 20:50.300
I'LL TREASURE IT FOREVER,
YOU BIG LUG.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.600
EVERYONE FINDS LOVE AND ROMANCE
IN PARIS EXCEPT ME.

20:59.600 --> 21:03.800
I GOTTA GO SOMEWHERE
WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE REAL
AND DOWN TO EARTH.

21:03.800 --> 21:05.567
L.A., HERE I COME.

21:05.567 --> 21:07.000
[LAUGHS]

21:07.000 --> 21:08.400
WHAT A FLIGHT!

21:08.400 --> 21:11.200
5 1/2 HOURS
BEHIND A SCREAMING KID.

21:11.200 --> 21:15.033
SOMEBODY OUGHT TO PUT
HIM IN A CAGE
AND PUT HIM DOWN BELOW.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.133
HEY, ARE YOU FAMOUS?

21:17.133 --> 21:20.400
DO PEOPLE TELL YOU
YOU LOOK LIKE TIM ALLEN?

21:20.400 --> 21:21.400
BECAUSE YOU DO.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.600
WHERE DO I
FIND DREW CAREY?

21:23.600 --> 21:25.100
I WANNA HAVE LUNCH
WITH HIM.

21:25.100 --> 21:27.967
HE SEEMS LIKE A FUN GUY.

21:29.300 --> 21:33.233
AHH, YOU GOTTA LOVE L.A.
