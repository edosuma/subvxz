WEBVTT

00:00.901 --> 00:03.036
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>"The Practice..."</i>

00:03.069 --> 00:04.370
I got a lewd and
lascivious scheduled

00:04.404 --> 00:05.539
for trial this morning,
but Judge Hiller,

00:05.572 --> 00:07.240
she's ordered me
to get co-counsel.

00:07.273 --> 00:08.575
Why?

00:08.609 --> 00:11.144
Something about how
I've never won a trial.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.212
Bobby, it's bad for us
to even be associated

00:12.245 --> 00:14.047
with Harland Bassett.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.716
-He's a nice guy.
-Yeah, and the world's
worst attorney.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.684
I do not want to be
in court with that man.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.720
If I have you guys
on board as co-counsel,

00:19.753 --> 00:21.788
I know I could chip
the settlement up.

00:21.822 --> 00:24.490
Every time I sign up with you,
I end up getting embarrassed.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.326
That's not going
to happen this time.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.228
What's this case
and what's our involvement?

00:28.261 --> 00:29.796
Product liability
against a drug company

00:29.830 --> 00:31.231
that injured a little girl.
Harland --

00:31.264 --> 00:33.333
This guy ponies you up
every time.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.801
I told him I'd join him
for a settlement conference.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.503
That's all it will be.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.540
-Gentlemen, come right in.
-That's John Rapherson.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.074
You know him?

00:41.107 --> 00:42.475
The man is one
of the top three

00:42.509 --> 00:45.078
civil litigators in Boston.

00:45.111 --> 00:47.113
Our client has directed us
not to settle.

00:47.147 --> 00:50.083
We just beat the EPA
for over $30 million

00:50.116 --> 00:52.318
on injuries that weren't
even as bad.

00:52.352 --> 00:54.154
They beat the EPA,
Mr. Bassett.

00:54.187 --> 00:56.590
Now while I salute
your last-minute ingenuity

00:56.623 --> 00:59.159
in signing them up
for shock value,

00:59.192 --> 01:01.795
we know who opposing counsel
really is.

01:01.828 --> 01:04.864
Eugene, this is Christine
and Annie Mullin, our clients.

01:04.897 --> 01:07.333
-Hello.
-That drug did this to her?

01:07.367 --> 01:08.702
Every bit of it.

01:08.735 --> 01:11.271
Six months ago
she was completely healthy.

01:11.304 --> 01:13.507
Annie,
you up for a fight?

01:13.540 --> 01:14.808
Yes.

01:14.841 --> 01:17.277
You tough enough to take on
the drug company?

01:17.310 --> 01:19.846
I'll be as tough
as I need to be.

01:24.484 --> 01:26.820
The big hurdle
is causation --

01:26.853 --> 01:29.890
Proving the drug caused
Annie's liver failure.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.392
And do we have to prove it

01:32.425 --> 01:34.394
beyond a reasonable doubt?

01:34.427 --> 01:36.730
No, that's
a criminal standard.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.364
The burden here is

01:38.398 --> 01:40.133
the preponderance
of the evidence.

01:40.166 --> 01:41.835
Where is Harland?

01:41.868 --> 01:43.637
He should be right in.

01:43.670 --> 01:46.472
Mr. And Mrs. Mullin,
we don't think we'll win.

01:46.507 --> 01:49.810
Our goal here --
If we can do well enough

01:49.843 --> 01:52.478
that we might win, then we
should be able to settle

01:52.513 --> 01:56.650
because Hayden Laboratories
can't risk losing.

01:56.683 --> 01:58.652
Does that make sense?

01:58.685 --> 02:01.555
Yeah, I think so.

02:01.588 --> 02:04.691
Let me check on Harland.

02:07.894 --> 02:11.331
Harland,
the Mullins are waiting.

02:11.364 --> 02:13.166
Oh, could you take
the meeting, Eugene?

02:13.199 --> 02:14.568
Take the meeting?
It's a pretrial.

02:14.601 --> 02:16.169
They want to talk to you.

02:16.202 --> 02:17.604
I'm just...

02:17.638 --> 02:19.606
What's wrong?

02:19.640 --> 02:21.575
I'm having a little anxiety.

02:21.608 --> 02:24.711
It's nothing. Had it before.
It goes away.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.312
What goes away?

02:26.346 --> 02:28.915
What exactly
are you feeling?

02:28.949 --> 02:32.185
My breathing
gets a little hard.

02:32.218 --> 02:34.588
I just need
a few minutes.

02:34.621 --> 02:36.256
So...

02:36.289 --> 02:37.724
Should I tell them
to wait?

02:37.758 --> 02:40.894
No.

02:40.927 --> 02:42.529
I'm okay.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.565
Harland?

02:44.598 --> 02:46.667
Okay.

02:48.368 --> 02:49.736
Okay.

02:51.404 --> 02:53.540
I can't get air.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.208
Harland!

02:56.476 --> 02:58.745
â™ª (theme)

03:52.032 --> 03:54.000
I want to do one more test,

03:54.034 --> 03:56.436
but from everything I can see,
it was just an anxiety attack.

03:56.469 --> 03:58.371
-Your heart looks fine.
-Thank God.

03:58.404 --> 04:00.741
We can keep you overnight,
or you can leave, if you want.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.643
No, I got to leave.
I'm in trial in six hours.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.911
Harland, I think
we can get a continuance.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.647
I wouldn't be so sure,
Eugene.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.950
This judge said
the last one was final.

04:09.983 --> 04:12.786
But this is medical. You had
a near heart attack, so --

04:12.819 --> 04:14.487
That's the problem.
Could I have a second?

04:14.521 --> 04:16.422
Absolutely.
I'll check back.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.663
The last continuance I got,

04:22.696 --> 04:24.765
I, uh...

04:24.798 --> 04:27.067
I sort of faked
a heart attack.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.403
What do you mean you
sort of faked a heart attack?

04:30.436 --> 04:32.072
He wasn't going to give me
any more time,

04:32.105 --> 04:34.675
so I grabbed my chest

04:34.708 --> 04:36.777
and I said
I had to go to my doctor.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.879
He says,
"If this happens again,

04:38.912 --> 04:41.347
"Then somebody else is
going to have to try it

04:41.381 --> 04:43.550
'cause the case is
going forward no matter what."

04:43.584 --> 04:45.085
You're the only one
who can try this case.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.820
We don't know it well enough.

04:46.853 --> 04:48.989
Which is why I ought to be
checking out tonight.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.557
Hand me my pants, would you?

04:55.862 --> 04:57.698
So you're going forward?

04:57.731 --> 05:00.567
He says he's ready.
Exhibits?

05:00.601 --> 05:02.569
They've been delivered
to the courthouse.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.470
Do you guys
have any chance?

05:04.505 --> 05:06.439
That isn't encouragement,
Ellenor.

05:06.472 --> 05:07.841
The first chance you get
to settle --

05:07.874 --> 05:10.476
Don't worry.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.012
Are we ready?

05:12.045 --> 05:13.413
We're ready.

05:13.446 --> 05:14.915
All right.

05:22.989 --> 05:26.426
Annie Mullin came to me
with a sinus infection.

05:26.459 --> 05:29.062
I first treated it
with another antibiotic.

05:29.095 --> 05:32.733
When that didn't work,
I prescribed Reflexin.

05:32.766 --> 05:36.570
Reflexin -- This is
also an antibiotic?

05:36.603 --> 05:39.105
-That's correct.
-And what happened?

05:39.139 --> 05:41.842
After taking the drug,
she almost immediately

05:41.875 --> 05:43.844
went into
acute liver failure,

05:43.877 --> 05:46.547
ultimately resulting
in two transplants.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.014
In your medical opinion,
ma'am,

05:48.048 --> 05:50.851
did Reflexin cause
this liver failure?

05:50.884 --> 05:53.486
I cannot state it
to a medical certainty,

05:53.520 --> 05:56.757
but I can think of no cause
other than the Reflexin.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.592
Objection.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.493
Doctor, did you know
that Reflexin was dangerous?

06:00.527 --> 06:01.962
Objection -- No foundation.

06:01.995 --> 06:04.130
Sustained.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.800
What were your expectations
regarding the safety

06:06.833 --> 06:08.869
of this antibiotic, doctor?

06:08.902 --> 06:12.072
I was aware that it hadn't
been tested on children,

06:12.105 --> 06:14.440
but neither are about
80% of the drugs

06:14.474 --> 06:15.976
on the market today.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.444
Obviously, I didn't consider it
to be dangerous.

06:18.478 --> 06:20.547
If I did, I wouldn't have
prescribed it.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.716
But this is an adult drug.

06:22.749 --> 06:24.985
Yes, but we have to prescribe
adult drugs to children

06:25.018 --> 06:26.553
because
the pharmaceutical companies

06:26.587 --> 06:28.655
test so few of them on kids.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.524
And to your knowledge,
do many pediatricians

06:30.557 --> 06:32.926
prescribe adult drugs
to children?

06:32.959 --> 06:35.095
We all do routinely.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.197
All right, doctor,
would you tell the court

06:37.230 --> 06:39.465
how you first learned
about Reflexin?

06:39.499 --> 06:42.002
The same way I hear
about all new drugs.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.904
The company
sends out a rep --

06:43.937 --> 06:46.172
He's called a detail person --
To promote the product.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.208
Did this detail person
say anything

06:48.241 --> 06:50.476
about the safety of Reflexin?

06:50.511 --> 06:52.946
He represented it to me
as very safe.

06:52.979 --> 06:55.081
Did he warn you
about giving it to kids?

06:55.115 --> 06:57.483
No, he did not.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.653
Doctor, you were sued
by the Mullins,

06:59.686 --> 07:01.955
and you settled out of court,
did you not?

07:01.988 --> 07:04.658
On the advice of my lawyer,
I settled the claim, yes.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.860
Now as part of that
settlement agreement,

07:06.893 --> 07:09.229
you agreed to assist
the plaintiff

07:09.262 --> 07:11.497
in pursuing her claims
against other parties.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.700
Yes, but I only agreed
to tell the truth,

07:13.734 --> 07:15.669
which is
what I've done here.

07:15.702 --> 07:17.604
The, uh...

07:17.638 --> 07:19.239
The literature
that you received

07:19.272 --> 07:22.676
from my client's
detail person

07:22.709 --> 07:24.110
included all
labeling information,

07:24.144 --> 07:25.712
-did it not, doctor?
-Yes.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.714
And I show you a copy
of that information

07:27.748 --> 07:29.716
now marked and identified
as exhibit "A."

07:29.750 --> 07:32.853
Could you read
the highlighted section?

07:32.886 --> 07:34.855
"Not proven safe
and effective

07:34.888 --> 07:37.591
"For children
under 16 years of age."

07:37.624 --> 07:41.261
And yet you prescribed it
to a 13-year-old girl?

07:41.294 --> 07:44.798
It's done all the time.

07:44.831 --> 07:47.601
Thank you, doctor.

07:47.634 --> 07:51.004
Mr. Bassett, redirect?

07:51.037 --> 07:54.074
Can you think
of anything else?

07:54.107 --> 07:56.276
No. You got
what you can from her,

07:56.309 --> 07:58.912
and you don't want
to give Rapherson

07:58.945 --> 08:00.814
another whack at cross.

08:00.847 --> 08:02.115
Right.

08:08.955 --> 08:11.925
Harland...

08:11.958 --> 08:15.261
Tell the judge
you have nothing further.

08:15.295 --> 08:19.499
Uh, nothing further
from this witness, your honor.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.203
Looking at the biopsy
on her liver,

08:23.236 --> 08:25.672
I concluded to a reasonable
degree of medical certainty

08:25.706 --> 08:29.643
that drug toxicity was
the cause for the failure.

08:29.676 --> 08:32.779
Do you know which drug
caused this toxicity?

08:32.813 --> 08:34.648
It had to be the Reflexin.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.015
Two weeks after she took it,

08:36.049 --> 08:38.552
she needed
an emergency transplant.

08:38.585 --> 08:40.654
She had no medical history
that made her susceptible,

08:40.687 --> 08:42.756
and I found no other factors
that would have contributed

08:42.789 --> 08:44.157
to the failure.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.292
Okay, Doctor.

08:46.326 --> 08:47.928
Can you tell us

08:47.961 --> 08:51.031
why the Reflexin would have
caused her liver to fail?

08:51.064 --> 08:53.199
All drugs are metabolized
through either the liver

08:53.233 --> 08:55.636
or the kidneys,
and sometimes the drug

08:55.669 --> 08:57.904
can simply
overwhelm the liver.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.641
Can it attack children
in particular?

09:00.674 --> 09:02.042
Children are
especially vulnerable.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.678
They have immature livers,

09:04.711 --> 09:06.312
and for a number of reasons,

09:06.346 --> 09:08.682
they cannot be treated simply
as small adults.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.317
That's why this drug should
have been tested on children.

09:11.351 --> 09:14.187
Was it?
No.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.957
Are you aware
of any research or data

09:16.990 --> 09:19.860
that suggests Reflexin
causes liver failure?

09:19.893 --> 09:22.228
Hayden's own data indicated
abnormal levels

09:22.262 --> 09:25.098
of liver activity.
That's from their own study.

09:25.131 --> 09:27.367
Now in this data
that you referred to,

09:27.400 --> 09:29.202
what percent
of the participants

09:29.235 --> 09:31.004
had an elevated
liver function?

09:31.037 --> 09:32.639
I believe it was 2%.

09:32.673 --> 09:33.940
2%.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.909
Are there other drugs
on the market that cause

09:35.942 --> 09:38.679
similar levels
of elevated liver activity?

09:38.712 --> 09:39.746
Yes.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.315
-A few? Many?
-Many.

09:42.348 --> 09:44.050
Do you know
how many people would die

09:44.084 --> 09:45.118
if we took them
off the market?

09:45.151 --> 09:46.753
Objection -- Speculative.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.021
Sustained.

09:48.054 --> 09:49.756
Doctor,
you spoke about children

09:49.790 --> 09:52.859
being especially vulnerable.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.661
Isn't it true
that children's livers

09:54.695 --> 09:58.064
are typically more resilient
than adults?

09:58.098 --> 10:00.667
Typically, yes,
but not always.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.268
Thank you, doctor.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.208
It was a good start --
Solid.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.976
It was?

10:10.010 --> 10:12.245
It seemed like the doctors
admitted they weren't sure.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.880
Well, we knew they'd have to.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.248
That's what we talked about
last night --

10:15.281 --> 10:17.417
Proof is tough,

10:17.450 --> 10:19.720
but Harland did a good job.

10:19.753 --> 10:22.322
Why is he breathing
into that bag?

10:22.355 --> 10:24.157
It works.
I do it all the time.

10:24.190 --> 10:26.426
You get more oxygen
that way.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.996
So what's next?

10:30.030 --> 10:31.965
Annie's next.

10:31.998 --> 10:34.000
You ready, Annie?

10:34.034 --> 10:35.702
Yes.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.103
Now, you going to have
to be brave up there.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.372
I'm ready.

10:39.405 --> 10:42.008
You're going to do great.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.959
While she's testifying,

10:58.992 --> 11:01.027
I do not want you
to move.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.162
Not at all?

11:02.195 --> 11:03.764
Not at all.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.231
She's our case, Harland.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.000
Now if they're going
to budge on settling,

11:07.033 --> 11:09.135
Annie's testimony
will have to do it.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.071
We need every juror's eyes
on her.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.873
Okay.

11:12.906 --> 11:16.142
We're almost there,
aren't we?

11:16.176 --> 11:18.244
We haven't even finished
putting in our case.

11:18.278 --> 11:21.815
After that,
they put on a defense.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.284
Right.

11:24.317 --> 11:26.119
Let's go.

11:26.152 --> 11:28.188
I threw up a lot,

11:28.221 --> 11:30.390
but I thought it was
the stomach flu,

11:30.423 --> 11:32.826
then I was
on the bus to school

11:32.859 --> 11:34.194
and I passed out.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.129
What happened?

11:36.162 --> 11:37.831
They said my liver
stopped working

11:37.864 --> 11:39.099
and I needed another one.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.266
And then?

11:40.300 --> 11:42.936
Then I got really sick
for a few weeks.

11:42.969 --> 11:45.906
My eyes and skin
turned yellow

11:45.939 --> 11:47.473
and I lost
all this weight,

11:47.508 --> 11:49.442
but then they found
a new liver.

11:49.475 --> 11:51.845
So you got a transplant?

11:51.878 --> 11:53.146
Yeah...

11:53.179 --> 11:55.148
But it didn't work.

11:55.181 --> 11:57.083
Tell us how it didn't work.

11:57.117 --> 12:00.987
My body started to reject
the replacement liver.

12:01.021 --> 12:04.457
I got really sick.

12:04.490 --> 12:06.827
It took a long time
to find another one.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.929
Longer than the first one?

12:08.962 --> 12:12.065
Yes. I wasn't
as high on the list anymore

12:12.098 --> 12:13.366
because they thought...

12:13.399 --> 12:16.436
That my body would reject
the next liver, too.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.972
Is everything
going to be okay now?

12:19.005 --> 12:21.407
I don't know.

12:21.441 --> 12:24.778
My body's still having
some problems.

12:24.811 --> 12:26.813
They had me on these
anti-rejection pills

12:26.847 --> 12:29.382
that I have to take every day
for the rest of my life,

12:29.415 --> 12:31.885
and that make me more likely

12:31.918 --> 12:35.321
to get stuff like infections
and cancer.

12:35.355 --> 12:39.059
Annie, what if you need
a third transplant?

12:39.092 --> 12:42.328
I probably
wouldn't get it.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.798
I'm too far
down the list.

12:44.831 --> 12:47.133
Thank you, Annie.

12:57.243 --> 13:00.446
I'm very sorry
about your illness, Annie.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.849
I know that everybody
in this room

13:02.883 --> 13:05.385
wishes you
a complete recovery.

13:05.418 --> 13:06.953
Thank you.

13:06.987 --> 13:09.489
I'm going to just ask you
a few questions.

13:09.523 --> 13:11.892
If at any time
you want to take a break,

13:11.925 --> 13:13.994
I'm sure we can do that.
Okay?

13:14.027 --> 13:16.262
Okay.

13:23.537 --> 13:25.839
When the doctors
were diagnosing you,

13:25.872 --> 13:28.909
did they ask whether you had
taken any other drugs

13:28.942 --> 13:31.211
or taken
too many pain relievers?

13:31.244 --> 13:34.180
I think so, yeah.

13:34.214 --> 13:36.482
Do you remember
what your answer was?

13:36.517 --> 13:38.118
I told them that I hadn't,

13:38.151 --> 13:40.186
except for
the other antibiotics.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.622
Okay.

13:41.655 --> 13:44.024
You know they were asking
about other possible reasons

13:44.057 --> 13:45.992
your liver failed.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.493
Yes.

13:47.528 --> 13:50.030
You also told them

13:50.063 --> 13:52.365
you hadn't drunk alcohol,
right?

13:52.398 --> 13:53.934
Yes.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.435
Now, Annie...

13:58.505 --> 14:01.141
Remember a sleepover

14:01.174 --> 14:02.609
at your friend
Robin Cohen's house

14:02.643 --> 14:05.546
a few weeks
before you fell ill?

14:05.579 --> 14:08.481
I think so.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.383
If we brought Robin here

14:10.416 --> 14:12.418
and asked whether you
and the other girls drank

14:12.452 --> 14:16.322
from her father's
liquor cabinet...

14:16.356 --> 14:18.258
What would she say?

14:20.093 --> 14:23.363
I hardly had anything.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.065
So you had some.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.002
Yes.

14:29.035 --> 14:31.171
You didn't tell that
to the doctors,

14:31.204 --> 14:32.305
though, did you?

14:32.338 --> 14:34.641
No.

14:34.675 --> 14:37.911
Are there any other things
you didn't tell the doctors?

14:37.944 --> 14:39.513
No.

14:41.347 --> 14:43.249
Okay.

14:47.453 --> 14:49.623
Prior
to your taking Reflexin,

14:49.656 --> 14:51.625
you'd taken
other antibiotics, right?

14:51.658 --> 14:53.326
Yes.

14:53.359 --> 14:55.529
And you'd had a flu
a few weeks before this?

14:55.562 --> 14:57.263
Yes.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.099
Did you take
any cough medicine?

14:59.132 --> 15:00.934
-Yes.
-Pain relievers?

15:00.967 --> 15:02.603
Yes.

15:02.636 --> 15:04.037
Okay, Annie,

15:04.070 --> 15:06.206
that's actually all I have.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.308
And again,
let me extend my wishes

15:08.341 --> 15:11.545
that you have a complete
and healthy recovery.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.914
Thank you.

15:21.755 --> 15:25.626
Annie, how much alcohol
have you had in your life?

15:25.659 --> 15:29.462
I've had, like,
two sips of vodka.

15:29.495 --> 15:31.331
That's it.

15:31.364 --> 15:32.699
I hated it.

15:32.733 --> 15:35.969
And did you tell
the truth to the doctors

15:36.002 --> 15:37.971
for all the other questions
they asked you?

15:38.004 --> 15:39.472
Yes.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.608
Thank you, Annie.

15:46.012 --> 15:48.549
Eugene's going to dinner
with the defense lawyer.

15:48.582 --> 15:50.283
They've now seen our case.

15:50.316 --> 15:52.185
If we're going
to get an offer,

15:52.218 --> 15:53.453
this would be the time.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.522
It's a good sign
that he's willing

15:55.556 --> 15:56.657
to have dinner, right?

15:56.690 --> 15:58.424
We hope.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.293
I'm sorry.

16:00.326 --> 16:02.996
Sorry?

16:03.029 --> 16:05.265
Why, sweetheart?

16:05.298 --> 16:07.467
For not telling you
about that sleepover

16:07.500 --> 16:09.503
and the alcohol.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.572
Hey,
you did great up there.

16:11.605 --> 16:13.574
That was just a cheap trick.

16:13.607 --> 16:15.475
It'll backfire. You watch.

16:21.815 --> 16:24.518
The doctor said it, John.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.687
Toxicity to the liver
caused the failure.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.622
He ruled out everything
but Reflexin.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.091
I thought
I crossed him okay.

16:31.124 --> 16:33.727
But the bottom line is
it's in the record,

16:33.760 --> 16:37.363
plus we have a very
sympathetic little girl.

16:37.397 --> 16:40.233
You're preaching
to the choir.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.569
I've been trying
to convince Hayden

16:42.603 --> 16:43.737
to offer something.

16:43.770 --> 16:44.771
Trust me, I don't like

16:44.805 --> 16:46.139
going up
against little girls.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.674
So what gives?

16:47.708 --> 16:49.375
I think they're angry.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.612
Your client?

16:51.645 --> 16:54.480
The pediatrician dropped
the ball here, Eugene.

16:54.515 --> 16:56.783
I'm not saying doctors
don't prescribe off label.

16:56.817 --> 16:58.585
I know they do,

16:58.619 --> 17:01.522
but she should have
at least monitored the girl.

17:01.555 --> 17:03.790
Now, for her to settle out
with a promise

17:03.824 --> 17:06.326
to testify
against the drug company --

17:06.358 --> 17:08.561
She's not the first doctor
to do that.

17:08.595 --> 17:11.064
Exactly, which is why
they're so angry.

17:11.097 --> 17:13.465
Give me something.

17:13.499 --> 17:15.401
Come on, admit it.

17:15.435 --> 17:18.371
Harland Bassett has done
better than you thought.

17:18.404 --> 17:21.575
If it were up to me...

17:21.608 --> 17:23.076
But it isn't.

17:39.660 --> 17:41.595
Okay.

17:41.628 --> 17:44.364
We just keep going.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.499
Their first witness
is the hepatologist.

17:46.533 --> 17:50.637
Dr. Peter Kendall.

17:50.671 --> 17:53.373
Reflexin is not
the most likely cause

17:53.406 --> 17:55.542
of Miss Mullin's
liver damage.

17:55.576 --> 17:57.778
Can you be sure
of that, Dr. Kendall?

17:57.811 --> 17:59.746
Viral infections are
the most common cause

17:59.780 --> 18:01.748
of liver failure in children.

18:01.782 --> 18:04.317
This girl was coming off
a stomach flu,

18:04.350 --> 18:05.886
and that's probably
the very infection

18:05.919 --> 18:07.453
that led
to her liver injury.

18:07.487 --> 18:10.524
Can you state this
to a medical certainty, doctor?

18:10.557 --> 18:12.693
Not a certainty.
You have to understand

18:12.726 --> 18:15.128
that the cause of most cases
of liver failure

18:15.161 --> 18:16.763
in children is unknown.

18:16.797 --> 18:18.665
So in a majority of cases,

18:18.699 --> 18:20.701
there's no cause found.

18:20.734 --> 18:21.902
That's correct, but here,

18:21.935 --> 18:23.837
we know she had
a viral infection,

18:23.870 --> 18:27.708
which we can isolate
as the most likely culprit.

18:27.741 --> 18:29.710
Doctor, isn't it true
that the vast majority

18:29.743 --> 18:32.713
of stomach flus
do not cause liver failure?

18:32.746 --> 18:34.615
Neither do most drugs.

18:34.648 --> 18:36.583
But the speed at which
Annie's liver failed

18:36.617 --> 18:39.620
is more consistent
with drug toxicity, isn't it?

18:39.653 --> 18:41.187
In general, yes.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.389
You can't rule out Reflexin

18:43.423 --> 18:45.926
as a cause
of Annie's injuries, can you?

18:45.959 --> 18:47.561
Well, the question is not --

18:47.594 --> 18:49.896
You can't rule it out,
can you?

18:49.930 --> 18:51.464
No.

18:51.497 --> 18:54.568
And, doctor, how many times
have you testified

18:54.601 --> 18:56.202
for drug companies?

18:56.236 --> 18:57.704
I can't be sure.

18:57.738 --> 18:59.239
-More than 50?
-Yes.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.574
More than 100?

19:00.607 --> 19:01.608
Probably.

19:01.642 --> 19:02.809
And in all these appearances,

19:02.843 --> 19:05.512
have you ever testified
for a plaintiff?

19:05.546 --> 19:07.147
No, I haven't.

19:10.483 --> 19:13.887
I'll take them
to the witness room.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.561
Am I crazy,
or is Harland --

19:20.594 --> 19:22.829
He was good just then.

19:22.863 --> 19:24.631
He was.

19:24.665 --> 19:25.699
Eugene,
we've put in our case,

19:25.732 --> 19:26.933
we just had
their first witness,

19:26.967 --> 19:28.602
and we're in this.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.571
Nobody's laughing in there.

19:30.604 --> 19:33.206
Yeah, but now come
their big guns.

19:33.239 --> 19:34.307
I know...

19:34.340 --> 19:36.743
But nobody's laughing.

19:43.249 --> 19:46.286
For a drug to be approved
in the United States,

19:46.319 --> 19:48.254
it needs to go through
an incredible testing process.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.223
When you say "Incredible" --

19:50.256 --> 19:53.426
I mean hundreds
of millions of dollars.

19:53.459 --> 19:55.662
First comes testing
on a cellular level,

19:55.696 --> 19:56.963
then animals.

19:56.997 --> 20:00.266
The last step
is clinical trials on humans.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.868
Then what?

20:01.902 --> 20:04.370
Then the company turns over
its clinical data

20:04.404 --> 20:05.672
to the FDA medical officers.

20:05.706 --> 20:07.774
They review the data,
then they convene

20:07.808 --> 20:11.311
an advisory panel of outside
independent specialists

20:11.344 --> 20:12.445
who give an opinion,

20:12.478 --> 20:14.715
which the FDA may
or may not follow.

20:14.748 --> 20:17.984
What does it mean to have
approval from the FDA?

20:18.018 --> 20:19.520
It's the gold standard.

20:19.553 --> 20:20.721
Meaning?

20:20.754 --> 20:22.523
The United States
has the safest,

20:22.556 --> 20:23.790
most rigorous

20:23.824 --> 20:25.792
pharmaceutical testing
process in the world.

20:25.826 --> 20:28.361
Many, many drugs
are available overseas

20:28.394 --> 20:31.297
that are prohibited here
for safety reasons.

20:31.331 --> 20:33.667
In fact,
a number of states

20:33.700 --> 20:35.969
limit the liability
of drug manufacturers

20:36.002 --> 20:38.471
from suits if their product
is FDA approved.

20:38.505 --> 20:40.674
-Objection.
-Sustained.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.342
Jury will disregard.

20:42.375 --> 20:43.844
From your review
of the data,

20:43.877 --> 20:46.580
did Hayden laboratories
comply

20:46.613 --> 20:48.749
with testing requirements
for Reflexin?

20:48.782 --> 20:50.350
Absolutely.

20:50.383 --> 20:51.417
Thank you, Doctor.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.787
HARLAND: In the last
four years,

20:53.820 --> 20:56.923
11 different drugs have been
pulled off the market

20:56.957 --> 21:00.460
after the FDA approved them.
Isn't that correct?

21:00.493 --> 21:01.762
Yes.

21:01.795 --> 21:04.698
Duract -- Painkiller,
linked to liver failure.

21:04.731 --> 21:05.932
That was one of them.

21:05.966 --> 21:08.401
Objection. This trial
is about Reflexin --

21:08.434 --> 21:09.736
They opened the door,
your honor.

21:09.770 --> 21:11.304
This witness testified

21:11.337 --> 21:14.040
that the FDA's approval
was the gold standard.

21:14.074 --> 21:16.610
Objection overruled.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.945
Lotronex --
Irritable bowel syndrome,

21:18.979 --> 21:21.047
suspected cause
of five deaths.

21:21.081 --> 21:22.048
Yes.

21:22.082 --> 21:23.884
Propulsid -- Heartburn.

21:23.917 --> 21:25.819
Suspected
in over 300 deaths.

21:25.852 --> 21:29.523
-Yes, but --
-Seldane, Rezulin,
the list goes on.

21:29.556 --> 21:31.792
All approved by the FDA,

21:31.825 --> 21:35.495
all pulled
because of safety concerns.

21:35.529 --> 21:37.330
The fact that these drugs
were withdrawn

21:37.363 --> 21:39.566
shows that
the system works,

21:39.600 --> 21:42.335
that the FDA investigators
are doing their job.

21:42.368 --> 21:45.872
Think the 20 million Americans
who took those drugs

21:45.906 --> 21:47.508
believe the system works?

21:47.541 --> 21:48.675
Objection.

21:48.709 --> 21:50.043
Sustained.

21:50.076 --> 21:52.579
The fact that the FDA
approved Reflexin

21:52.613 --> 21:55.949
doesn't establish it's safe,
does it, doctor?

21:55.982 --> 21:59.485
There are never
any guarantees.

22:01.454 --> 22:04.457
I am extremely proud
of Reflexin.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.426
It kills
bacterial infections

22:06.459 --> 22:09.596
that can lead to pneumonia
and meningitis.

22:09.630 --> 22:13.366
It saves lives
every single day.

22:13.399 --> 22:16.770
Are you satisfied, sir,
that it's safe?

22:16.803 --> 22:20.140
Absolutely,
when used as directed.

22:20.173 --> 22:22.976
Here, it was not used
as directed.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.378
It is not intended
for children.

22:25.411 --> 22:27.013
Now, I don't believe

22:27.047 --> 22:30.517
that Reflexin caused
Annie Mullin's injuries.

22:30.551 --> 22:33.720
Nevertheless, it should never
have been prescribed.

22:33.754 --> 22:36.022
That's why our label
is clear --

22:36.056 --> 22:38.925
"Not proven safe
for children under 16."

22:38.959 --> 22:41.528
What else can we do?

22:41.562 --> 22:43.530
We cannot be held
responsible

22:43.564 --> 22:46.533
for every doctor
who ignores our warnings.

22:46.567 --> 22:47.934
Thank you, Mr. Yates.

22:52.973 --> 22:54.407
Eugene.

22:56.977 --> 22:58.679
Can you take this one?

22:58.712 --> 22:59.946
What?

22:59.980 --> 23:01.181
I'm feeling...

23:01.214 --> 23:02.849
Overwhelmed.

23:02.883 --> 23:04.117
Look, Harland,

23:04.150 --> 23:05.652
I really don't think
we should let

23:05.686 --> 23:08.121
what that witness just said
hang with the jury.

23:08.154 --> 23:10.924
The sooner we defuse it,
the better.

23:21.735 --> 23:24.705
The FDA advisory committee
that approved your drug

23:24.738 --> 23:27.140
was comprised
of 12 doctors, correct?

23:27.173 --> 23:28.141
Yes.

23:28.174 --> 23:29.743
And seven of them

23:29.776 --> 23:31.612
had financial ties
to your company, didn't they?

23:31.645 --> 23:34.480
We fund research,
Mr. Bassett.

23:34.515 --> 23:36.883
I mean, if that qualifies
as financial ties,

23:36.917 --> 23:39.686
then, technically,
you may be correct.

23:39.720 --> 23:42.122
Fact is,
the drug industry

23:42.155 --> 23:45.626
is the major source
of funding for doctors

23:45.659 --> 23:48.028
who study the safety
and efficacy of drugs.

23:48.061 --> 23:49.563
Isn't that right,
Mr. Yates?

23:49.596 --> 23:51.164
I believe so.

23:51.197 --> 23:53.767
And if a doctor's studies
don't come out like you want,

23:53.800 --> 23:56.169
he's not going to get a grant
next time around

23:56.202 --> 23:57.170
for his research, is he?

23:57.203 --> 23:58.471
That's not true.

23:58.505 --> 24:00.674
As part
of their compensation,

24:00.707 --> 24:03.043
you offer these doctors
stock options

24:03.076 --> 24:04.210
in Hayden labs,
don't you?

24:04.244 --> 24:05.612
Sometimes.

24:05.646 --> 24:07.681
You make it in their
financial interest

24:07.714 --> 24:09.783
to make favorable findings.

24:09.816 --> 24:12.218
These are doctors
that you're talking about.

24:12.252 --> 24:13.954
They are going
to do what's right.

24:13.987 --> 24:15.689
They're doctors.

24:15.722 --> 24:17.023
They're going
to do what's right.

24:17.057 --> 24:19.225
-Objection -- Argumentative.
-Sustained.

24:19.259 --> 24:21.094
What's the average
review time

24:21.127 --> 24:22.963
for FDA approval?

24:22.996 --> 24:24.598
A little over a year.

24:24.631 --> 24:26.066
How long did the FDA

24:26.099 --> 24:28.602
review the application
for Reflexin?

24:28.635 --> 24:30.871
We were granted
an expedited review.

24:30.904 --> 24:31.872
How long?

24:31.905 --> 24:33.239
Six months.

24:33.273 --> 24:34.741
Do you think the FDA

24:34.775 --> 24:36.910
might have caught
the problems with Reflexin

24:36.943 --> 24:38.879
if they took
the normal review time?

24:38.912 --> 24:41.147
There were no problems
to catch.

24:41.181 --> 24:42.783
Really?

24:47.821 --> 24:49.155
No problems to catch?

24:51.925 --> 24:55.061
What is
an adverse drug report?

24:55.095 --> 24:57.631
It's a form
filled out by a doctor

24:57.664 --> 24:59.966
when a patient suffers
an unexpected reaction

25:00.000 --> 25:02.969
that might --
And I stress might --

25:03.003 --> 25:05.238
Be related
to a prescription drug.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.974
I'm holding
six adverse drug reports

25:08.008 --> 25:09.676
which list Reflexin

25:09.710 --> 25:13.013
as primary suspect
in liver damage.

25:13.046 --> 25:15.582
Four involve children.

25:15.616 --> 25:17.017
You're talking six reports

25:17.050 --> 25:19.620
out of 2 million
prescriptions.

25:19.653 --> 25:21.855
But doctors aren't required
to file these reports,

25:21.888 --> 25:23.624
are they, Mr. Yates?

25:23.657 --> 25:26.126
Some experts estimate
six reports

25:26.159 --> 25:29.996
translates to 600
actual complications.

25:30.030 --> 25:30.997
I disagree.

25:31.031 --> 25:32.699
You are aware
that doctors

25:32.733 --> 25:35.602
are prescribing Reflexin
to kids, aren't you?

25:35.636 --> 25:39.105
All we can do is to make
the appropriate warning.

25:39.139 --> 25:42.609
We can't control
what doctors do.

25:42.643 --> 25:44.044
Yes or no.

25:44.077 --> 25:47.581
You know doctors
are prescribing it to kids.

25:47.614 --> 25:48.915
Yes.

25:48.949 --> 25:52.218
Hayden Labs made
$265 million

25:52.252 --> 25:54.320
on Reflexin last year,
didn't they?

25:54.354 --> 25:56.590
-Objection.
-Overruled.

25:56.623 --> 26:00.293
$265 million.

26:00.326 --> 26:03.296
How much of that came
from off-label use by children?

26:03.329 --> 26:04.631
Some.

26:04.665 --> 26:06.332
Some.

26:06.366 --> 26:09.335
Children are good business,
aren't they, Mr. Yates?

26:09.369 --> 26:11.705
-Objection.
-Overruled.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.039
You don't test children

26:13.073 --> 26:14.775
'cause you don't want
to know what you'd find.

26:14.808 --> 26:15.776
That is untrue.

26:15.809 --> 26:17.343
Why do you only test adults

26:17.377 --> 26:19.880
when you know your drug
is going to kids?

26:23.316 --> 26:24.818
(sighs)

26:24.851 --> 26:29.322
We limited our research
and market to adults

26:29.355 --> 26:32.759
because the product
is intended for adults.

26:32.793 --> 26:36.697
Again, we cannot control
what the doctors do.

26:36.730 --> 26:39.633
But when doctors prescribe
Reflexin to kids,

26:39.666 --> 26:42.869
you don't issue
a stronger warning.

26:42.903 --> 26:45.171
You don't do anything
about it.

26:45.205 --> 26:47.207
You just take the money.

26:47.240 --> 26:48.208
Objection!

26:48.241 --> 26:49.976
Sustained.

26:50.010 --> 26:53.179
Truthfully, you have researched
children, haven't you?

26:54.715 --> 26:57.183
This is your research.

26:57.217 --> 27:01.688
Six isolated cases
is not data, Mr. Bassett.

27:04.157 --> 27:06.893
How about seven?

27:15.068 --> 27:16.670
You did great.

27:16.703 --> 27:18.672
He did great.

27:18.705 --> 27:19.806
So now what?

27:19.840 --> 27:20.974
Closing arguments.

27:21.007 --> 27:22.709
A good close
and we have a chance.

27:22.743 --> 27:23.944
I haven't
written it yet.

27:23.977 --> 27:25.111
You'll do it tonight.

27:25.145 --> 27:26.146
(knock on door)

27:32.152 --> 27:34.320
Can we get together?

27:37.123 --> 27:39.125
We'll be right out.

27:42.896 --> 27:44.698
-Here comes the offer.
-Oh, my God.

27:44.731 --> 27:46.166
-What?
-All right, listen,

27:46.199 --> 27:48.034
we need
to pick a number.

27:48.068 --> 27:50.436
I need to go out there
with a number.

27:50.470 --> 27:51.772
$600,000.

27:51.805 --> 27:53.339
They won't pay $600,000.

27:53.373 --> 27:56.877
-$200,000.
-Harland, you don't
have to cave that much.

27:56.910 --> 27:58.244
How do you go
from $600,000 to $200,000?

27:58.278 --> 28:00.046
I'm confused.

28:00.080 --> 28:02.415
Look, liability
is still shaky.

28:02.448 --> 28:04.384
Last night,
the number was zero.

28:04.417 --> 28:08.354
Right now,
I think $400,000 is possible.

28:21.301 --> 28:23.369
$225,000.

28:23.403 --> 28:25.138
That was
a half a million-dollar cross

28:25.171 --> 28:26.807
if I ever heard one.

28:26.840 --> 28:28.509
$225,000 was as high
as he authorized me.

28:28.542 --> 28:30.243
I'm not playing
poker here.

28:31.812 --> 28:33.413
I could convince him
to throw in your fees.

28:33.446 --> 28:35.248
You took it
on a contingency.

28:35.281 --> 28:37.217
That's another $60,000
or so.

28:37.250 --> 28:38.752
Let's say goodbye to this
at $300,000.

28:38.785 --> 28:40.987
$400,000

28:41.021 --> 28:42.488
and we'll sign off.

28:42.523 --> 28:44.925
Can't do it, Eugene.
$300,000's the number.

28:44.958 --> 28:46.492
No.

28:48.128 --> 28:49.863
Okay.

28:49.896 --> 28:53.166
We get to do this
one more day.

28:57.571 --> 29:01.074
We just turned down
$300,000.

29:15.522 --> 29:17.924
Lucy?

29:20.360 --> 29:23.029
Guys.

29:23.063 --> 29:24.798
Guys?

29:27.200 --> 29:28.501
What time is it?

29:28.535 --> 29:30.403
7:30.
How late were you up?

29:30.436 --> 29:32.338
We just laid down
to take a break

29:32.372 --> 29:33.974
at 4:00 or so.

29:34.007 --> 29:36.309
-Do we have any coffee?
-I'll make some.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.979
I need new clothes.
I can't close in this.

29:39.012 --> 29:40.514
You got plenty of time.
It's early.

29:40.547 --> 29:41.515
When are you due in?

29:41.548 --> 29:43.249
9:00.

29:43.283 --> 29:44.951
Okay, so you don't
have plenty of time.

29:44.985 --> 29:46.352
I got to go home
and change.

29:46.386 --> 29:49.523
I'll meet you guys
there.

29:49.556 --> 29:52.358
They offered $300,000.

29:52.392 --> 29:54.528
And you turned it down?

29:54.561 --> 29:56.262
I know we can get
another $100,000

29:56.296 --> 29:57.363
if he closes well.

29:57.397 --> 29:59.365
Or it could
go back to zero.

29:59.399 --> 30:01.501
Have you ever heard
Harland Bassett close?

30:01.535 --> 30:02.869
It isn't pretty.

30:02.903 --> 30:05.071
He's different
this trial, Bobby.

30:05.105 --> 30:06.973
He's in some kind
of zone.

30:07.007 --> 30:08.208
In a zone?

30:08.241 --> 30:09.910
When have you ever,
ever known him

30:09.943 --> 30:12.345
not to screw things up?

30:12.378 --> 30:14.981
If you give him
enough time...

30:31.932 --> 30:34.300
We all know
to warn our kids

30:34.334 --> 30:37.337
about the kind of drugs
you buy on a street corner.

30:37.370 --> 30:39.606
We know
to steer them away

30:39.640 --> 30:42.609
from shady dealers
and back alleys.

30:42.643 --> 30:45.579
But what we don't know

30:45.612 --> 30:47.213
is that
they are twice as likely

30:47.247 --> 30:51.217
to die from the drugs
in our own medicine cabinets.

30:51.251 --> 30:54.154
James and Christine Mullin
told their daughter

30:54.187 --> 30:58.358
to take her medicine because
it would make her feel better.

30:58.391 --> 31:00.060
Look at her.

31:00.093 --> 31:02.529
A simple antibiotic.

31:02.563 --> 31:04.965
Two weeks later,
she lost her liver

31:04.998 --> 31:07.968
and her opportunity
for a normal life.

31:08.001 --> 31:10.236
The defense
would have you believe

31:10.270 --> 31:12.405
that her doctor bears
all the responsibility,

31:12.438 --> 31:15.642
but this ignores
one critical fact.

31:15.676 --> 31:18.078
Hayden Labs knew

31:18.111 --> 31:22.549
that once Reflexin
was approved for adults,

31:22.583 --> 31:25.351
it would make its way
to children.

31:25.385 --> 31:28.655
80% of the drugs
on the market today

31:28.689 --> 31:33.026
are not adequately
tested on kids.

31:33.059 --> 31:34.661
80%.

31:34.695 --> 31:36.963
And it's common practice
for doctors

31:36.997 --> 31:40.500
to prescribe these medications
to children.

31:40.534 --> 31:44.137
Now, knowing this,
what does Hayden Labs do?

31:44.170 --> 31:47.373
They slip in the most innocuous
warning they can,

31:47.407 --> 31:49.309
while at the same time

31:49.342 --> 31:52.546
marketing the drug
to pediatricians.

31:52.579 --> 31:57.017
But saying "Not proven
safe or effective"

31:57.050 --> 31:58.585
is not the same

31:58.619 --> 32:02.388
as warning
it could be dangerous,

32:02.422 --> 32:05.125
and they knew it.

32:07.260 --> 32:09.630
It's hard to wage a battle

32:09.663 --> 32:12.465
against
a big pharmaceutical company.

32:12.498 --> 32:15.669
This is
a $100 billion industry.

32:15.702 --> 32:18.304
I'm sorry, your honor,
I'm loath to object

32:18.338 --> 32:19.472
during a closing,

32:19.506 --> 32:20.574
but this is
neither relevant --

32:20.607 --> 32:22.709
It is relevant.

32:22.743 --> 32:24.511
The revenues they generate
are relevant

32:24.545 --> 32:27.714
to the extent
that they control research.

32:27.748 --> 32:30.350
I'll give you
a short leash, Mr. Bassett,

32:30.383 --> 32:32.218
but keep it
about the case.

32:34.320 --> 32:38.458
The drug companies --
They fund the research.

32:38.491 --> 32:41.361
They pay many doctors
who are in charge of testing

32:41.394 --> 32:43.129
whether a drug is safe,

32:43.163 --> 32:46.633
and some drugs get to the market
that are unsafe.

32:46.667 --> 32:49.570
In the last four years alone,

32:49.603 --> 32:52.205
20 million Americans
took drugs

32:52.238 --> 32:56.777
that were pulled off the market
because of safety reasons.

32:56.810 --> 33:00.313
20 million.

33:00.346 --> 33:04.785
And I submit that when Reflexin
is finally tested on kids,

33:04.818 --> 33:07.588
it, too,
will probably be pulled,

33:07.621 --> 33:09.255
but Hayden Labs --

33:09.289 --> 33:11.658
They're not going to test it,
ladies and gentlemen.

33:11.692 --> 33:13.660
Oh, not if they can help it.

33:13.694 --> 33:16.129
The problem
with test results

33:16.162 --> 33:17.798
is you're stuck with them.

33:17.831 --> 33:20.601
And they don't want
any test proving

33:20.634 --> 33:23.403
what Annie Mullin
already knows --

33:23.436 --> 33:29.275
That this drug
can cause liver failure.

33:29.309 --> 33:31.612
It caused hers.

33:31.645 --> 33:34.715
They don't care,
ladies and gentlemen.

33:34.748 --> 33:36.717
They don't give a damn.

33:36.750 --> 33:39.152
And the FDA?

33:39.185 --> 33:42.288
They rely on clinical
and advisory panels

33:42.322 --> 33:46.527
that are bankrolled
by these people.

33:46.560 --> 33:50.531
In the end,
it's not about safety.

33:50.564 --> 33:53.299
It's not about compassion.

33:53.333 --> 33:57.571
It's not about little girls
like Annie.

33:57.604 --> 33:59.806
It's about money.

33:59.840 --> 34:02.543
That's all they understand.

34:02.576 --> 34:05.378
Go back to that jury room

34:05.411 --> 34:07.781
and return with a number

34:07.814 --> 34:10.684
that'll make them understand.

34:29.503 --> 34:32.472
That was very impassioned.

34:32.505 --> 34:37.643
However, cases are decided
on fact and merit,

34:37.678 --> 34:39.312
not passion.

34:39.344 --> 34:41.481
Fact --

34:41.514 --> 34:45.819
The cause of most liver failure
in children is unknown.

34:45.851 --> 34:48.221
Fact --

34:48.254 --> 34:51.123
It's much more likely
that Miss Mullin's stomach flu

34:51.157 --> 34:54.594
caused her liver failure
than any drug she took.

34:54.628 --> 34:56.830
Fact --

34:56.862 --> 34:58.865
The FDA reviewed Reflexin

34:58.899 --> 35:00.433
and found it
to be safe and effective

35:00.466 --> 35:03.436
when used as directed.

35:03.469 --> 35:07.140
Fact --
The FDA still approves Reflexin.

35:07.173 --> 35:08.875
Fact -- We warned doctors

35:08.909 --> 35:11.678
not to use it
on children under 16.

35:11.712 --> 35:14.715
Fact -- Miss Mullin's doctor
read that warning

35:14.748 --> 35:17.417
and still prescribed it.

35:17.450 --> 35:20.787
Mr. Bassett
would have you believe

35:20.821 --> 35:22.723
that the evil
pharmaceutical companies

35:22.756 --> 35:25.258
are out there killing people
for profit.

35:25.291 --> 35:28.695
Reflexin is in the family
of antibiotics

35:28.729 --> 35:32.533
that has saved
millions of lives.

35:32.566 --> 35:34.267
All right, yes,

35:34.300 --> 35:36.202
the drug companies
fund research.

35:36.236 --> 35:38.639
Does this mean
that the findings are bought?

35:38.672 --> 35:40.206
Absolutely not,

35:40.240 --> 35:42.543
and there is no evidence
to suggest otherwise.

35:42.576 --> 35:45.178
They pay for this research
to get it done,

35:45.211 --> 35:47.714
to be able to discover
lifesaving medicines.

35:47.748 --> 35:50.450
We all live longer,
more enriched lives

35:50.483 --> 35:52.819
because of those medicines.

35:52.853 --> 35:58.625
Reflexin is one such
lifesaving medication.

35:58.659 --> 36:01.828
Now, do we know
some doctors

36:01.862 --> 36:04.831
might possibly prescribe it
to children?

36:04.865 --> 36:06.833
Yes.

36:06.867 --> 36:10.236
So we clearly warn them.

36:10.270 --> 36:13.907
"Not proven safe
for children."

36:13.940 --> 36:16.677
What else can we do?

36:16.710 --> 36:19.613
What else can we do?

36:47.007 --> 36:49.876
No matter what happens,
Harland,

36:49.910 --> 36:51.812
you tried a great case.

36:51.845 --> 36:54.648
I still wish I could have
done more with the medicals.

36:54.681 --> 36:56.249
There isn't more.

36:56.282 --> 36:58.985
It's not like the truth
is out there somewhere.

36:59.019 --> 37:01.688
I don't know

37:01.722 --> 37:03.990
how I'm ever going
to be able to repay you.

37:04.024 --> 37:06.527
Me?

37:06.560 --> 37:07.794
I just sat there.

37:07.828 --> 37:09.229
Yeah, right.

37:17.403 --> 37:19.840
$400,000 -- Sealed.

37:23.677 --> 37:25.846
I need a second
with co-counsel.

37:35.488 --> 37:37.524
I don't know
how to advise you.

37:37.558 --> 37:39.626
I can't say
we're going to win,

37:39.660 --> 37:40.827
but if we win,

37:40.861 --> 37:42.596
it should be
more than $400,000.

37:44.765 --> 37:47.000
What does your gut
tell you?

37:47.033 --> 37:50.070
Only that
I got to throw up.

37:50.103 --> 37:52.973
No matter what, we got
to run it by the client.

37:56.643 --> 37:58.845
If they're offering
$400,000,

37:58.879 --> 38:01.481
do you think
they'd go higher?

38:01.515 --> 38:02.749
This lawyer doesn't
really play that way.

38:02.783 --> 38:04.450
He just puts it out.

38:04.484 --> 38:06.486
Now, that's not to say
we couldn't chip it up some,

38:06.520 --> 38:08.054
but --

38:08.088 --> 38:10.023
Harland, six months ago,

38:10.056 --> 38:12.793
we put ourselves
in your hands.

38:18.031 --> 38:19.399
Let's go to verdict.

38:19.432 --> 38:21.001
Harland.

38:21.034 --> 38:23.504
They never thought
we'd get this far, Eugene.

38:23.537 --> 38:25.438
Let's go to verdict.

38:25.471 --> 38:26.840
Let me see if I can
get it up to $600,000.

38:26.873 --> 38:27.841
No.

38:27.874 --> 38:29.876
Let's go to verdict.

38:29.910 --> 38:33.079
You understand, Mr. Mullin,
that this could --

38:33.113 --> 38:35.882
I understand
that Harland took us here.

38:35.916 --> 38:38.351
I'm going
to follow his instinct.

38:38.384 --> 38:40.787
(pager beeps)

38:40.821 --> 38:43.456
Jerry's back?
Who's Jerry?

38:44.791 --> 38:47.928
Jury.
The jury's back.

38:47.961 --> 38:49.462
Let's go.

38:55.669 --> 38:58.505
And, Eugene --

38:58.539 --> 38:59.973
I'm sure.

39:00.006 --> 39:02.108
Okay.

39:26.499 --> 39:27.968
$600,000.

39:29.936 --> 39:31.437
No.

39:40.847 --> 39:42.749
Can you get a read?

39:42.783 --> 39:46.119
No.

39:53.594 --> 39:55.596
Mr. Foreman,
have you reached a verdict?

39:55.629 --> 39:57.631
We have, your honor.

39:57.664 --> 40:00.466
What say you?

40:02.603 --> 40:03.804
In the matter

40:03.837 --> 40:05.471
of Anne Mullin
vs. Hayden Laboratories...

40:06.940 --> 40:08.174
We find in favor

40:08.208 --> 40:11.878
of the plaintiff
Anne Mullin,

40:11.912 --> 40:13.880
and we order the defendant
to pay compensatory damages

40:13.914 --> 40:16.817
in the amount
of $5.6 million.

40:16.850 --> 40:19.886
(audience gasping
and murmuring)

40:29.495 --> 40:30.764
The defendant
moves for a judgment

40:30.797 --> 40:32.198
notwithstanding
the verdict.

40:39.105 --> 40:41.041
The evidence
never established causation,

40:41.074 --> 40:43.744
and no reasonable jury
could find that it did.

40:43.777 --> 40:44.945
In the alternative,

40:44.978 --> 40:46.713
we're entitled
to a new trial.

40:58.825 --> 41:00.561
Denied.

41:02.729 --> 41:04.064
Members of the jury,

41:04.097 --> 41:05.832
this concludes your service.

41:05.866 --> 41:07.968
Your judgment is so entered,

41:08.001 --> 41:11.572
and you are dismissed
with thanks from the court.

41:20.614 --> 41:21.582
(sniffs)

41:21.615 --> 41:23.584
How about that?

41:23.617 --> 41:24.785
Yeah.

41:27.788 --> 41:29.990
You look like
you're about to cry.

41:30.023 --> 41:31.858
Yeah...

41:31.892 --> 41:34.260
And if you tell anybody,
I'll kill you.

42:14.067 --> 42:16.903
â™ª (theme)

42:38.358 --> 42:40.060
You stinker!
