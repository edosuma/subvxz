00:08.550 --> 00:10.802
Hi there. It's me, Vinnie Green.

00:10.886 --> 00:13.764
I'm cruising around
beautiful Southern California,

00:13.847 --> 00:17.059
meeting with people having
a bit of a tough time staying healthy.

00:17.142 --> 00:20.312
Like my friend, today,
here in sunny San Diego.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.606
A little bird told me
she's having a hard time

00:22.689 --> 00:24.316
treating her body right.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.235
But you know what the real kick is?

00:26.318 --> 00:27.945
She doesn't know I'm coming.

00:28.028 --> 00:31.156
That's right. I'm gonna surprise her.
Isn't that fun?

00:31.240 --> 00:33.033
Okay, now I'm getting nervous.

00:34.076 --> 00:36.119
What about you, Lady?
Are you getting nervous?

00:37.621 --> 00:39.498
Of course not. You're a rock!

00:40.123 --> 00:42.835
Okay, here we go!

00:58.308 --> 00:59.351
Hey there!

01:01.103 --> 01:03.230
Drop your weapon, I come in peace!

01:03.313 --> 01:04.857
Oh, my goodness!

01:05.482 --> 01:06.984
Vinnie Green!

01:07.067 --> 01:10.696
What are you doing here?
I can't believe it!

01:10.779 --> 01:12.906
It's really me.

01:12.990 --> 01:14.241
Surprise!

01:17.244 --> 01:20.831
-I'm really here!
-Oh, Vinnie! Vinnie!

01:22.666 --> 01:26.003
So, we had a moment in the kitchen.
You almost cut my throat!

01:26.086 --> 01:27.880
Well, I was scared!

01:28.630 --> 01:30.883
How did I know
you were gonna show up here?

01:30.966 --> 01:33.177
I know. But now, here we are.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.139
And I think you have a story to tell.

01:38.599 --> 01:39.975
Are you ready to tell it?

01:40.851 --> 01:43.353
-I don't know if I'm ready.
-We never are.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.898
But I'm right here,
and I'll help you start.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.525
We've got a little problem, don't we?

01:48.609 --> 01:50.527
Yes. Yes, we do.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.029
With the F-word.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.239
Not that one. I mean food.

01:55.073 --> 01:58.660
Talk to me about your relationship
with food.

01:58.744 --> 02:02.080
Okay. This is gonna be tough.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.458
Well…

02:05.125 --> 02:08.836
Ever since I was a teenager, I've had this

02:09.795 --> 02:12.591
-thing where I--
-Uh-huh.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.927
It's okay. I'm here. Look at me. I'm here.

02:15.010 --> 02:17.429
Where I--

02:17.513 --> 02:18.889
Sometimes I--

02:18.972 --> 02:20.307
You binge eat.

02:20.390 --> 02:24.144
Well, yes, but it's part of a--

02:24.228 --> 02:26.104
You know, it's a whole…

02:26.772 --> 02:27.773
Uh-huh, a whole…

02:27.856 --> 02:30.317
…sort of, routine.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.528
Of bingeing and purging.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.531
Right. And once I'm in it,

02:35.614 --> 02:38.450
it's kind of like I've been,
sort of, kidnapped.

02:39.201 --> 02:43.580
It's like someone's got like a--

02:43.664 --> 02:46.542
-Like a knife to your throat.
-Yeah. And I just--

02:46.625 --> 02:50.254
I eat so much that it's really painful
and scary.

02:50.337 --> 02:53.507
And I feel like I'm gonna burst open.

02:53.590 --> 02:56.051
If I don't purge, I'm gonna die.

02:56.134 --> 03:00.556
Oh, dear. I am so sorry.
That's just terrible.

03:00.639 --> 03:02.099
Yeah. It's terrible.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.226
I'm a terrible, disgusting

03:05.394 --> 03:07.271
awful monster.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.856
You really are.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.234
But you don't have to be.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.112
What if I told you
we could get you on a road

03:15.195 --> 03:17.406
to a healthy, happy new you?

03:18.198 --> 03:20.284
Starting today, right now.

03:20.784 --> 03:22.244
How would that sound?

03:22.870 --> 03:24.496
Why are you touching my face?

03:24.580 --> 03:25.831
Because I love you.

03:25.914 --> 03:28.292
But you don't even know me.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.252
Why am I talking to you?

03:30.335 --> 03:33.046
Why am I telling you this story?
I've never told anyone.

03:33.130 --> 03:36.633
Not a single person in my life! Not ever!

03:36.717 --> 03:39.011
What is this fucking place?

03:39.094 --> 03:41.388
What is this place? Where the fuck am I?

03:41.471 --> 03:44.933
This isn't my house! What's happening?

03:45.017 --> 03:46.643
Ready to tell your story?

03:47.186 --> 03:48.520
I think you are.

03:49.354 --> 03:50.731
I don't know.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.775
Let me help you begin.

03:53.859 --> 03:57.237
We've got a problem with food.

03:57.321 --> 03:59.072
-Yes. Yes, I do.
-Yes.

03:59.156 --> 04:02.659
I have a problem with food.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.744
Yes.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.371
This is tough.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.415
Go on. I'm right here.

04:09.875 --> 04:12.544
You feel out of control, right?

04:12.628 --> 04:15.297
One simple phone call
can be your first step

04:15.380 --> 04:17.632
on a journey to a whole new you.

04:17.716 --> 04:20.677
The Meal-a-Wheel system is so easy,
even I can do it!

04:20.761 --> 04:22.513
Once you take control of your food,

04:22.596 --> 04:25.182
you'll think,
"What else can I take control of?"

04:29.394 --> 04:33.732
I'm so proud of Mary Beth here.
And I want to be proud of you too.

04:33.815 --> 04:37.110
Don't waste another day
when you can get started right now.

04:37.194 --> 04:38.695
Give me a call.

04:39.363 --> 04:40.572
Babe?

04:41.990 --> 04:45.202
Are you up again?
You know you need to rest.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.329
I know, baby. I just-- I can't sleep.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.706
I think it's this medication
that's just keeping me up.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.292
And then my brain starts to get going,
and I just get--

04:52.376 --> 04:54.670
-I have some ideas about--
-Yeah.

04:54.753 --> 04:57.256
No, hon, I don't want you
worrying about work.

04:57.339 --> 04:58.757
You know what you need right now?

04:58.841 --> 05:01.718
You need to rest. You need to recover.

05:01.802 --> 05:05.097
I want you gaining weight. Okay?

05:05.180 --> 05:09.017
Your health is too important,
and your fertility is too important.

05:09.101 --> 05:10.143
Hang on.

05:10.227 --> 05:13.772
The doctor said there's still time,
as long as you take care of yourself.

05:13.856 --> 05:15.232
Nip this in the fucking bud.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.234
You know that I'm not
getting pregnant again, right?

05:18.402 --> 05:20.487
No one's making any decisions tonight.

05:20.571 --> 05:21.947
No, baby, I'm telling you,

05:22.030 --> 05:24.074
I've already decided that that--

05:24.157 --> 05:27.369
Let's rest. And let's recover.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.621
We'll talk about it later. Okay?

05:30.205 --> 05:32.124
Get in here.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.084
Doesn't that feel nice?

05:34.168 --> 05:37.379
Won't you join me
and take control of your body

05:37.462 --> 05:38.881
and your life?

05:38.964 --> 05:42.176
All you have to do is make the call today.

05:52.811 --> 05:55.105
It's 10:00 a.m. She's still here.

05:55.189 --> 05:56.982
Well, maybe because
you made her an omelet!

05:57.065 --> 05:59.067
I was trying to be nice.

05:59.151 --> 06:01.612
I have a hospitality gene.
It's not like there's an off switch.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.447
Last night you weren't nice.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.531
You were naughty.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.367
-I was.
-Yeah.

06:07.451 --> 06:10.120
Wait, I was. Was I? Did you think I was?

06:10.204 --> 06:12.206
I mean, I felt like I was.

06:12.289 --> 06:13.832
Yeah, yeah.

06:13.916 --> 06:16.627
-You were into it. Yeah.
-Yes. Yeah. I was.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.295
So, I was thinking-- Ernie,

06:18.378 --> 06:20.839
I was thinking that maybe next time,

06:21.465 --> 06:26.345
I could pick the way that we,
you know, spice things up.

06:26.428 --> 06:29.056
Yeah. Whatever you want, honey. I'm open.

06:29.139 --> 06:32.142
Yes. I'm gonna think about that.

06:32.726 --> 06:33.936
What I want.

06:35.229 --> 06:38.857
-Okay, but can you get rid of her?
-Thanks again for a lovely evening.

06:38.941 --> 06:41.693
-Yes. Yeah. It was our pleasure.
-Yeah.

06:41.777 --> 06:44.821
It was our mutual pleasure.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.114
Yes.

06:47.658 --> 06:48.659
You know what?

06:48.742 --> 06:50.702
That's actually
the sex toy side of the sink.

06:50.786 --> 06:52.871
You know what? It's fine. It's all good.

06:52.955 --> 06:55.123
-Don't even worry about it.
-Okay.

06:55.207 --> 06:56.625
Really easy going.

07:00.379 --> 07:01.588
The wave is dead.

07:02.673 --> 07:05.008
Which means the surf is dead.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.386
When the surf is dead,
it's time to move on.

07:07.469 --> 07:09.972
Bunch of us are gonna get jobs
on the tuna boats.

07:10.055 --> 07:12.182
-It's not too late if you wanna come.
-Tuna?

07:12.266 --> 07:15.310
Yeah. Or albacore. Whatever's bountiful.

07:15.394 --> 07:19.231
He's not getting on a tuna boat, geezer.
He's sticking around here with me.

07:21.024 --> 07:23.652
All right. All right, later.

07:23.735 --> 07:24.945
'Kay, bye.

07:28.824 --> 07:31.994
Our blessed landlord
finally got the other toilet fixed.

07:32.870 --> 07:34.454
So now she can double the rent.

07:36.540 --> 07:37.708
Good luck, you two!

07:50.179 --> 07:52.181
-Hi, you guys!
-Hey!

07:52.264 --> 07:54.141
-Get in here.
-Sure.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.018
How you doing, man?

07:56.101 --> 07:59.104
Well, I wish we were
on the other side of this mountain,

07:59.188 --> 08:02.065
but it turns out the only thing harder
than hurting is healing.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.150
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.443
You're so brave.

08:04.526 --> 08:05.527
-Yeah.
-Okay, here we go.

08:05.611 --> 08:08.405
-This is for you and that's for Maya.
-Okay.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.865
-Feel better.
-Yeah.

08:09.948 --> 08:12.784
Hey, hon, I'm here. How are you feeling?

08:13.327 --> 08:16.079
Stuck. Just stuck here.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.999
-Stuck!
-Yeah, the resting is hard. I know.

08:19.082 --> 08:22.252
It's not even that.
I just wanna get back to my life.

08:22.836 --> 08:23.837
And I need to.

08:24.796 --> 08:27.716
You're going through so much
all at the same time.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.927
It's the worst. I can't even imagine.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.345
I don't know. Maybe I can.

08:31.428 --> 08:34.097
My favorite uncle died the same week
I gave birth to the twins, and--

08:34.181 --> 08:35.349
I'm oversharing again.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.767
It's okay.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.269
You're in my bedroom. I think we're there.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.605
I'm so sorry, Sheila, about all of it.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.191
About your father. About your ovary.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.193
I have another one.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.529
Ovary. Not a father.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.073
You didn't happen to bring
those notepads that I mentioned?

08:51.156 --> 08:55.327
No, I didn't, because I brought you
something so much better.

08:55.911 --> 08:57.120
It's called…

08:57.996 --> 09:00.123
a dry-erase board.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.501
Ernie's friend from MIT sent it over.

09:02.584 --> 09:03.794
Watch this.

09:11.468 --> 09:12.594
Gone.

09:12.678 --> 09:13.887
Cool.

09:14.638 --> 09:15.848
Let's get to work.

09:16.473 --> 09:18.100
-All right.
-Oh, yes!

09:18.183 --> 09:21.603
-Here we go. As promised.
-Here we go. Yes, now there we go.

09:22.646 --> 09:24.398
-Beautiful.
-Here you go.

09:24.481 --> 09:27.693
Hey, so this marina thing you did.

09:27.776 --> 09:29.862
-Yeah. Yeah.
-With the kids?

09:29.945 --> 09:32.197
That was really something.

09:32.281 --> 09:34.491
Yeah, we are gonna change the world,
I'll tell you that.

09:34.575 --> 09:35.993
So you stopped construction?

09:37.035 --> 09:37.953
No. No, no.

09:38.036 --> 09:43.876
They started demolition that night.
But our mailing list is bonkers.

09:43.959 --> 09:45.711
And that's the real measuring stick.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.004
Yeah, yeah.

09:49.715 --> 09:52.426
It's hard watching our community
swing so far to the right.

09:52.509 --> 09:53.802
-Isn't it?
-Yeah.

09:53.886 --> 09:56.346
Not really the kind of swinging
I'm into if you know what I mean.

09:56.847 --> 09:59.474
Okay. Yeah, pretty sure I do.

09:59.558 --> 10:02.936
Greta tells me you and Sheila
are into sharing as well.

10:03.604 --> 10:07.900
A certain boundarylessness.

10:10.319 --> 10:12.696
-You know what I mean.
-You're talking about socialism?

10:15.449 --> 10:18.702
Greta and I brought a second woman
into our bed last night.

10:19.328 --> 10:20.829
Ernie. What?

10:22.206 --> 10:23.207
Threesome?

10:23.290 --> 10:26.293
Yeah, well, at its high points it was.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.879
Wow. Wow.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.548
Must be old hat for you though.

10:31.632 --> 10:34.384
Come on, Mr. Berkeley, free love.

10:34.468 --> 10:35.719
That was a while ago.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.304
A long while ago.

10:38.138 --> 10:41.141
I tried to chip away at it again recently,

10:42.851 --> 10:44.394
but I didn't really get that far.

10:44.978 --> 10:48.732
Yeah, Greta tells me
you guys are going through a rough patch.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.526
Greta really tells you
a lot of stuff, huh?

10:51.109 --> 10:52.402
Yeah, she tells me a lot.

10:53.028 --> 10:54.279
Sometimes too much.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.115
Okay, 'cause I thought
the tape was going great.

10:58.408 --> 10:59.409
It is.

10:59.493 --> 11:02.996
You have a following.
At the fairground. You have fans.

11:03.664 --> 11:06.750
No, I just have customers.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.126
But I don't have this.

11:12.631 --> 11:14.716
-You found comfort in food?
-Oh, yeah.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.134
-Yes.
-Vinnie Green. I've seen this.

11:16.218 --> 11:19.012
Late-night TV, right? The Meal-a-Wheel?

11:19.096 --> 11:20.347
Look. Look.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.224
Look how that woman is looking at him.

11:22.307 --> 11:23.809
That's not a customer.

11:23.892 --> 11:26.728
That's a follower. That's devotion.

11:26.812 --> 11:28.981
These women look at him

11:29.481 --> 11:32.317
like they're under his spell.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.571
What can I say?

11:35.654 --> 11:36.864
Men are coercive.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.909
Take Ernie, for instance.

11:40.993 --> 11:43.161
The minute you show any sexual interest,

11:43.245 --> 11:45.497
he just ups the ante, and--

11:46.290 --> 11:49.585
No. Sorry. Nope.
We're not talking about me.

11:49.668 --> 11:51.253
We're talking about you. Yeah.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.964
And here you are, bouncing ideas off me.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.174
Sorry. Go.

11:55.257 --> 11:57.259
Is there something
you wanna tell me, Greta?

11:57.342 --> 11:58.594
No, no.

11:58.677 --> 12:01.013
I'm here supporting you on your journey,

12:01.096 --> 12:03.515
professionally and otherwise.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.852
I had a threesome.

12:07.477 --> 12:13.233
Each time things start to happen again

12:13.317 --> 12:16.695
I think I got something good…

12:20.199 --> 12:21.200
Yello.

12:24.578 --> 12:27.206
Is the lady of the house in?

12:28.540 --> 12:32.169
Well, whomst doth call
thine lady of the house?

12:32.252 --> 12:33.712
This is…

12:34.713 --> 12:38.592
Mike, with Kowalski HVAC.

12:38.675 --> 12:41.720
Yeah, I want to talk with her
about ventilation.

12:42.554 --> 12:45.516
It can really help with the efficiency
of her gas range.

12:45.599 --> 12:50.229
Well, I don't know what data farm
sold you our number,

12:50.312 --> 12:52.272
but we are not interested, so…

12:52.356 --> 12:53.982
I guess I just wasn't made

12:54.066 --> 12:55.776
Is that the fucking Beach Boys?

12:55.859 --> 13:02.491
For these times

13:05.827 --> 13:07.204
I can do this.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.623
I can build this. I can grow.

13:09.706 --> 13:10.958
Of course you can.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.669
Yeah. Vinnie Green does not
have the secret sauce.

13:13.752 --> 13:16.547
Vinnie Green has no--
You got the secret sauce, baby!

13:16.630 --> 13:18.715
Hey, hon! Hey.

13:18.799 --> 13:21.051
There is a Kevin here?

13:21.134 --> 13:22.803
From Stahl/Grunner to say hello.

13:22.886 --> 13:24.721
He was pretty persistent,
even though I told him

13:24.805 --> 13:27.891
-you don't need any visitors right now.
-No, it's fine.

13:27.975 --> 13:30.060
Hi, Kevin. Come in.

13:32.062 --> 13:33.272
I didn't know you were--

13:33.355 --> 13:34.982
I'm sorry, I didn't know
you were undressed.

13:35.816 --> 13:36.817
No.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.236
It's just a robe.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.322
I think we'll all make it
out of here alive.

13:42.906 --> 13:43.949
These are so beautiful.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.576
-These flowers.
-Yes. Thank you.

13:45.659 --> 13:49.121
I'm gonna take 'em from you
and put 'em in some water.

13:49.204 --> 13:51.123
Yeah? So--

13:51.206 --> 13:53.542
You guys probably have a lot
to talk about. So…

13:53.625 --> 13:55.043
Secret sauce, yeah? Okay?

13:55.127 --> 13:56.253
-Okay.
-Hey, Danny?

13:56.837 --> 13:58.422
Will you help me just

13:58.505 --> 13:59.673
get these in some water?

13:59.756 --> 14:02.384
-Yeah. Yeah, right away.
-I need some water. Like a lot of water?

14:02.467 --> 14:04.845
-Yeah, we got a lot of water, Greta.
-All right, calm down.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.430
You have the secret sauce.

14:06.513 --> 14:10.017
Yes, so, I've been thinking.

14:10.642 --> 14:11.727
And--

14:11.810 --> 14:13.896
You know, about the marketing plan.

14:13.979 --> 14:18.233
And I know we've been focusing on
in-person appearances.

14:18.317 --> 14:21.737
But just looking ahead,
I'm wondering what's next?

14:21.820 --> 14:24.531
Well, there had been some talk
of regional health--

14:24.615 --> 14:27.576
Because I'm thinking about television,
infomercials.

14:27.659 --> 14:31.038
I mean, in an hour,
I could reach more people than--

14:31.872 --> 14:34.374
I'm sorry. Did you just say
you had been thinking?

14:34.458 --> 14:35.959
No one knows the future, right?

14:36.043 --> 14:38.420
Your doctor said it could be a month
before you're on your feet again.

14:38.504 --> 14:39.630
You spoke to my doctor?

14:39.713 --> 14:41.298
No, but my dad did.

14:41.882 --> 14:43.675
He updated all of us
on the marketing team.

14:43.759 --> 14:46.136
A whole room of men
talking about your pussy.

14:46.220 --> 14:47.638
Just to, you know,

14:47.721 --> 14:50.015
see how many appearances
we needed to cancel,

14:50.098 --> 14:51.642
how much this whole,

14:51.725 --> 14:53.644
you know, like…

14:53.727 --> 14:54.978
Private medical issue?

14:55.062 --> 14:56.104
…would cost the company.

14:56.188 --> 14:58.148
And heads up, it's a bundle.

14:58.232 --> 15:00.484
But it looks like
you're doing better already.

15:00.984 --> 15:02.277
Dad will be happy to hear it.

15:02.361 --> 15:04.321
This shit is on a spy mission.

15:04.821 --> 15:07.866
Kevin, you can tell your dad that

15:07.950 --> 15:10.744
he doesn't need to cancel
any more appearances because

15:10.827 --> 15:14.623
I have someone who can fill in for me
until I get back up on my feet,

15:14.706 --> 15:16.375
and they're a very worthy substitute.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.794
They'll be great. So just let him know.

15:27.386 --> 15:28.512
Back in the car.

15:30.764 --> 15:31.890
-Hey.
-Hey.

15:31.974 --> 15:34.059
Let's go easy on the horn.

15:34.142 --> 15:37.771
Sorry. I just got excited.
I'm ready to burn the world down.

15:37.855 --> 15:38.856
We got the kids.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.649
-They're all pumped up on soda.
-Yeah.

15:40.732 --> 15:42.818
-We got signs.
-I am sorry to say,

15:42.901 --> 15:44.236
I gotta bow out today.

15:44.820 --> 15:45.821
You're not coming.

15:45.904 --> 15:48.323
I thought I could leave her,
but every time I turn my back,

15:48.407 --> 15:50.826
she's up again, she's taking risks.

15:52.077 --> 15:54.037
She just doesn't know how to stop
unless I'm--

15:54.121 --> 15:57.499
Watching over her? What are you,
the husband or the warden?

15:59.084 --> 16:02.838
Sorry. I shouldn't joke.
You're a great husband.

16:02.921 --> 16:05.007
And it's obvious
that you're working so hard.

16:05.090 --> 16:06.133
You look exhausted.

16:06.216 --> 16:09.845
Sometimes
when the body and spirit need mending,

16:09.928 --> 16:12.598
it's up to me to be the tailor.

16:12.681 --> 16:13.974
I'm just nervous.

16:14.057 --> 16:16.935
PBS SoCal is coming,
and you're the voice of this thing.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.521
I don't know how we're supposed to
speak for it without you.

16:19.605 --> 16:22.649
No. Look, just speak from the heart, okay.

16:22.733 --> 16:26.111
Who cares if it sounds
a little primitive or unformed?

16:26.904 --> 16:28.906
All great social movements
throughout history,

16:28.989 --> 16:31.533
it started with an amateur
just doing the best they could.

16:31.617 --> 16:35.078
Well, since you're not coming with us…

16:35.704 --> 16:37.414
What do you got there?

16:38.207 --> 16:39.208
Is this for me?

16:40.375 --> 16:42.878
It is avocado and Gouda on pumpernickel.

16:42.961 --> 16:45.506
There's a little chili lime salt
in there as well.

16:45.589 --> 16:47.674
I go to the Mexican market to get it.

16:47.758 --> 16:49.468
You really are something else, aren't you?

16:51.178 --> 16:54.014
Get outta here. Go and save the world.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.225
-Bye.
-Yeah.

16:57.434 --> 16:59.144
Knock-knock.

16:59.228 --> 17:03.357
Here we have a grilled cheese sandwich,
my especialidad.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.651
It's packed with frozen spinach.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.486
Obviously it's not frozen anymore,

17:07.569 --> 17:09.820
but it is very high in iron.

17:09.905 --> 17:11.698
You know I can get up to eat.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.659
No, no, no. You are not going anywhere.

17:13.742 --> 17:16.787
You're gonna relax.
And you're gonna let me take care of you.

17:16.869 --> 17:19.164
Fatten you up
so he can get you pregnant again.

17:19.248 --> 17:21.625
I'm feeling a lot better, I promise.

17:26.088 --> 17:28.882
Hey. Nice pants.

17:29.466 --> 17:30.968
That blood on your shirt?

17:31.844 --> 17:32.845
Ketchup.

17:32.928 --> 17:34.972
If you say so.
Where are they keeping your mom?

17:36.181 --> 17:38.016
What if I told you that you could get--

17:38.100 --> 17:42.896
-Start over.
-Imagine you could have any kind of--

17:42.980 --> 17:44.898
Start over.

17:45.899 --> 17:46.984
I need your help.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.151
There it is.

17:50.988 --> 17:53.991
They fire you? Suspend you?

17:54.074 --> 17:55.284
What happened?

17:56.410 --> 17:58.203
I had a medical setback,

17:58.871 --> 18:01.206
and rather than let them
put me out to pasture,

18:01.290 --> 18:03.000
I thought that you could fill in.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.459
So, me on stage without you there?

18:05.377 --> 18:06.962
Just for a bit, till I'm better.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.589
When you knock me back down again?

18:09.298 --> 18:11.216
I'd pay you double what you made before.

18:13.886 --> 18:15.095
Why me?

18:15.179 --> 18:19.516
They can't find some curly-haired clone
to hop into your leotards?

18:19.600 --> 18:20.976
I'm sure they could,

18:21.059 --> 18:23.937
but there's no one like you, Bunny.
There's no one better.

18:24.021 --> 18:25.397
With your finesse, your talent,

18:25.480 --> 18:27.232
-your experience--
-Yeah, yeah.

18:27.316 --> 18:29.568
So, what's wrong with you anyway?

18:30.569 --> 18:31.737
The medical thing.

18:34.072 --> 18:38.160
I had to have emergency surgery
to remove a twisted ovary.

18:38.243 --> 18:39.328
Gross. When?

18:41.246 --> 18:44.333
-On the same day as my father's funeral.
-Fuck off.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.627
You're serious.

18:46.710 --> 18:49.087
Yeah. As I said,
that's why I need your help.

18:49.171 --> 18:50.964
I've already written your check,
along with a guide

18:51.048 --> 18:54.551
just with some notes on crowd engagement
to keep things consistent.

18:54.635 --> 18:57.846
You took all my moves,
and now you're telling me how to do them.

18:57.930 --> 19:01.058
-I have evolved things considerably.
-You're a piece of fucking work.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.559
I know you need this.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.146
Don't fight it
just 'cause you got a bruised ego.

19:06.230 --> 19:08.106
Do yourself a favor for once.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.083
You're going to figure this out.

19:27.209 --> 19:29.419
You can think bigger, better.

19:30.671 --> 19:31.672
On the other hand,

19:31.755 --> 19:35.968
you can't even handle Stahl/Grunner's
mouth-breathing, frat boy, nepotism hire.

19:37.386 --> 19:40.347
Maybe you don't have the secret.
Maybe you don't have the sauce.

19:40.430 --> 19:43.851
Maybe you're just stewing in your own
almost-was never-will-be--

19:44.351 --> 19:45.310
Hey.

19:45.394 --> 19:48.355
PBS SoCal's on.
I knew you wouldn't wanna miss it.

19:49.064 --> 19:50.065
Come on, sweetie.

19:52.568 --> 19:54.069
Surfers, developers,

19:54.152 --> 19:55.195
fishermen.

19:55.279 --> 19:58.323
Who guides
California's environmental future?

19:58.407 --> 20:02.244
According to a new group that calls itself
the Environmental Youth Enterprise,

20:02.327 --> 20:03.954
the future belongs to children.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.247
But who's leading them?

20:05.330 --> 20:07.207
I'd lower your expectations.

20:07.291 --> 20:10.294
They're probably just gonna reuse
footage from my stump from the protest.

20:10.961 --> 20:12.921
I was raised on this beach.

20:14.464 --> 20:16.258
I took my first steps on this beach.

20:16.341 --> 20:20.596
And never in my worst nightmares
did I think I would lose this beach.

20:21.180 --> 20:22.890
John Breem, you have no shame.

20:22.973 --> 20:24.433
The John Breem he refers to

20:24.516 --> 20:27.144
is San Diego's most prominent
commercial developer.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.813
His firm has a 30-year lease
on the cove with the city.

20:29.897 --> 20:32.274
-God.
-It's like John Lennon said,

20:32.357 --> 20:34.902
"Possession isn't nine-tenths of the law.

20:35.527 --> 20:37.571
It's nine-tenths of the problem."

20:37.654 --> 20:41.617
The idea that you could possess
the sea, the sky, the earth,

20:42.326 --> 20:44.661
it's a twisted capitalist fantasy.

20:45.245 --> 20:46.580
There you have it.

20:46.663 --> 20:50.709
Our children, our future,
will be heard from yet.

20:56.590 --> 20:58.759
Okay. Well…

20:59.551 --> 21:00.844
Fantastic.

21:01.512 --> 21:04.806
That's what we wanted, the kids out front.

21:04.890 --> 21:07.476
So, that's great.

21:08.810 --> 21:11.271
Great. Yeah.

21:12.064 --> 21:13.482
Sheil, what are you doing with those?

21:16.568 --> 21:18.445
-The weights?
-Yeah, the weights.

21:21.490 --> 21:24.618
The doctor didn't say anything about
an upper body workout being a problem.

21:24.701 --> 21:25.911
-It's very gentle--
-I don't care.

21:25.994 --> 21:28.288
I didn't give up on my responsibilities

21:28.372 --> 21:30.290
so that you could
just backslide like this.

21:30.374 --> 21:33.043
I didn't ask you
to give anything up, okay.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.545
You should've gone to the beach.

21:34.628 --> 21:37.381
Only, maybe you suspected
that you weren't needed there,

21:37.464 --> 21:39.132
and now everyone with a television
knows it.

21:39.925 --> 21:42.135
I'm gonna assume that
those are the meds talking.

21:42.219 --> 21:44.096
Look what I drew!

21:45.931 --> 21:47.766
Don't touch what's not yours!

21:49.977 --> 21:51.103
And you wanna have another one?

21:51.812 --> 21:53.605
Come on, sweetie.

21:55.065 --> 21:57.943
Let's go to the park. Mommy needs to rest.

22:03.073 --> 22:04.950
What the fuck is wrong with you?

22:06.034 --> 22:07.578
Are you that weak?

22:07.661 --> 22:09.246
You can't leave your husband.

22:09.329 --> 22:10.956
You can't run your business.

22:11.623 --> 22:13.876
So, you take it out on your child?

22:17.004 --> 22:19.256
You think she'll ever
forget what you said?

22:19.339 --> 22:21.758
You'll be indelibly cruel in her memory.

22:31.018 --> 22:32.561
But that makes sense, right?

22:32.644 --> 22:35.105
Your mom fucks up her kid.
You fuck up yours.

22:35.189 --> 22:38.734
On and on until your granddaughter ODs
on a bus station bathroom floor,

22:38.817 --> 22:39.902
with no friends.

22:39.985 --> 22:41.445
You're not better. You're worse.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.071
Just go. Go.

22:59.463 --> 23:01.965
You're not better than this.
You're not better than this.

23:02.049 --> 23:03.926
You've never been better than this.

23:37.251 --> 23:39.086
-What the hell is this?
-What?

23:39.169 --> 23:41.004
-Who's meeting you here?
-What?

23:41.088 --> 23:43.799
-You don't mess with people like this.
-You need to leave.

23:43.882 --> 23:46.802
-You don't make them think one thing--
-You need to leave. Leave, please!

23:46.885 --> 23:49.221
Get out of here. Get out! Get out!

23:54.476 --> 23:56.979
They think they can just buy us off.

23:57.062 --> 23:58.397
For a few weeks at least.

23:58.480 --> 24:02.276
They get to paper over all the pain
they cause with fucking cash.

24:02.359 --> 24:04.570
-Must be nice, huh?
-Well, we need it.

24:04.653 --> 24:07.197
And you grow up thinking, like,
the good overtakes the bad.

24:07.281 --> 24:10.200
You know, the gnarly shrinks
in the face of the mondo?

24:11.201 --> 24:13.078
This is a shit box of lies.

24:14.830 --> 24:16.248
If we wanna win,

24:17.666 --> 24:19.918
we're gonna have to start
speaking their language.

24:20.002 --> 24:21.879
You mean yuppie asshole?

24:21.962 --> 24:23.422
I mean blackmail.

24:25.340 --> 24:27.217
I got something on them.

24:27.968 --> 24:29.303
Something real bad.

24:29.386 --> 24:31.054
You got something?

24:31.930 --> 24:34.016
On Sheila and her husband?

24:36.018 --> 24:37.644
Not her husband.

25:11.803 --> 25:13.013
You're bleeding.

25:13.514 --> 25:16.808
I've got a field kit
in the trunk of my car.

25:16.892 --> 25:19.394
-I can go and get it.
-No. Don't.

25:21.313 --> 25:22.731
At least let me…

25:40.999 --> 25:42.042
My dad died.

25:43.544 --> 25:44.586
When?

25:45.170 --> 25:46.380
Two weeks ago.

25:48.382 --> 25:50.509
And then I had to have this operation.

25:52.928 --> 25:54.555
But it's--

25:54.638 --> 25:56.306
It's fine. It's over.

25:56.390 --> 25:57.599
I'm sorry.

26:02.062 --> 26:04.898
I hadn't heard from you, so…

26:06.149 --> 26:07.276
I got a little…

26:11.196 --> 26:12.531
I'm sorry.

26:12.614 --> 26:15.576
No, you thought I was coming here
to see someone else.

26:17.953 --> 26:19.496
It's much worse than that.

26:21.498 --> 26:24.793
I am someone else when I come here.

26:26.670 --> 26:29.673
It's disgusting, but it's me.

26:34.553 --> 26:36.680
You don't have to stay.

26:37.222 --> 26:38.640
You can go. It's okay.
