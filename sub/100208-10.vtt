Previously on Nancy Drew...

00:02.538 --> 00:05.861
JOHN: I got the toxicology back on Tiffany.
She didn't die of natural causes.

00:05.862 --> 00:06.737
She was poisoned.

00:06.823 --> 00:09.487
ACE: Lucy Sable disappeared after
the celebration, never seen again.

00:09.531 --> 00:11.359
NANCY:
What's the dress of girl
who was murdered

00:11.402 --> 00:13.926
20 years ago doing in my attic?

00:13.970 --> 00:16.059
Lucy knew Hudson family secrets
in the past,

00:16.103 --> 00:17.582
and the Hudsons called in
their favorite lawyer

00:17.626 --> 00:19.062
to come and clean up the mess.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.194
I didn't kill anyone!

00:20.237 --> 00:22.892
I have reason to suspect you!

00:22.935 --> 00:24.720
CARSON:
Karen found it in plain sight.

00:24.763 --> 00:27.070
You had quite the list
of evidence against me.

00:27.114 --> 00:30.595
Carson Drew, you're under arrest
for the murder of Lucy Sable.

00:33.642 --> 00:36.036
ANGELA:
Miss Drew, when did you
first come to believe

00:36.079 --> 00:38.734
your father was responsible
for the murder of Lucy Sable?

00:38.777 --> 00:42.085
You wrote: the Hudsons
paid Carson $50,000

00:42.129 --> 00:44.740
two days after
Lucy Sable's death.

00:44.783 --> 00:47.395
Did the Hudsons pay your
father to kill Lucy Sable?

00:47.438 --> 00:49.049
Can we call it a day?

00:49.092 --> 00:52.095
Nancy, you need to
take this seriously.

00:52.139 --> 00:54.532
Okay? You're gonna be subpoenaed
to testify against your father

00:54.576 --> 00:56.360
at his evidentiary hearing soon.

00:56.404 --> 00:58.406
And his trial after that.

00:58.449 --> 01:00.408
Look, I know you're
worried about your dad,

01:00.451 --> 01:02.062
but, I mean, we've got a...

01:02.105 --> 01:04.934
He's been in jail for two weeks,
and it's all my fault.

01:04.977 --> 01:07.893
He didn't kill Lucy.
My theory was all wrong.

01:07.937 --> 01:09.721
Okay, so if you're convinced
he's innocent, then

01:09.765 --> 01:11.549
help me get him out.

01:11.593 --> 01:14.248
Carson's not explaining any
of the evidence against him.

01:14.291 --> 01:16.206
Do you know why?

01:16.250 --> 01:17.860
No.

01:17.903 --> 01:19.644
He misses you.

01:19.688 --> 01:21.951
He said he calls during
his phone privileges twice

01:21.994 --> 01:23.431
a day, but you never pick up.

01:23.474 --> 01:25.215
Well, he shouldn't miss me.
He should hate me.

01:25.259 --> 01:26.738
I put him there.

01:26.782 --> 01:29.263
He's not capable of hating you.

01:29.306 --> 01:31.569
He's worried you're not eating.

01:31.613 --> 01:33.615
Well, tell him not to worry.

01:37.140 --> 01:39.751
Maybe you could
tell him yourself.

01:45.540 --> 01:47.063
Hmm.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.544
My grandmother used
to hang those around her house.

01:49.587 --> 01:51.111
Ghost traps?

01:51.154 --> 01:54.157
Are you trying to catch a ghost?

01:54.201 --> 01:57.160
Something like that.

Hey, did you text Nancy
to remind her to bring flowers?

02:19.530 --> 02:21.967
What, and add another
thing to her plate?

02:22.011 --> 02:24.013
No thanks.
You do it.

Sometimes you just got

I mean, she's not
completely alone.

02:34.110 --> 02:35.894
She talks to my mom.

02:35.938 --> 02:38.288
About how to find
a missing ghost.

02:38.332 --> 02:40.725
I know Nancy thinks
Simon flung Dead Lucy

02:40.769 --> 02:42.901
to the furthest depths
of the spirit world,

02:42.945 --> 02:45.991
but what if Lucy went MIA

02:46.035 --> 02:47.906
because they arrested the man
who murdered her,

02:47.950 --> 02:49.299
and she's finally at peace?

Hey.

04:25.134 --> 04:26.614
I've got a name for you.

Actaea pachypoda.

04:28.224 --> 04:30.357
It's what killed
Tiffany Hudson. Uh...

04:30.400 --> 04:32.576
Also known
as white baneberry poison.

04:32.620 --> 04:36.058
Uh, creating the poison from the
berries is incredibly difficult.

04:36.101 --> 04:37.494
Detecting it is even harder.

04:37.538 --> 04:40.323
Oh, well, good thing
I know a genius, right?

04:40.367 --> 04:43.370
Most coroners wouldn't even
screen for this toxin

04:43.413 --> 04:45.763
because it mimics a death
by cardiac event.

04:45.807 --> 04:49.245
They would just rule it natural
causes without a second thought.

every time I dig into a case,
I hurt everybody around me.

Hey.

Did you get
the DNA results back?

You're officially a Marvin.

the rest of the family?

06:17.289 --> 06:19.291
Um, actually...

06:19.335 --> 06:20.423
can we talk?

06:20.467 --> 06:22.164
Uh, yeah. About what?

06:22.207 --> 06:24.296
Um...

06:24.340 --> 06:25.994
Okay, as family, you should know

06:26.037 --> 06:27.909
that I obsessively worry.

06:27.952 --> 06:29.780
What are we talking about?

06:29.824 --> 06:32.392
It's about the burial coins
from the Velvet Masque.

06:32.435 --> 06:34.089
I need them.

06:34.132 --> 06:36.308
Those coins are
the proof that I need

06:36.352 --> 06:39.703
to put Everett Hudson behind
bars for sinking the Bonny Scot

06:39.747 --> 06:42.097
and murdering our
Uncle Sebastian.

06:42.140 --> 06:46.231
I really, really don't want
to upset you. Um...

06:46.275 --> 06:48.582
Hey.
The... Uh...

06:48.625 --> 06:50.105
I destroyed the coins.

06:50.148 --> 06:53.587
Yeah, I accidentally
melted them. Long story.

06:53.630 --> 06:58.592
But if you're going to be upset
with anyone, it's my fault.

06:58.635 --> 07:01.029
I paid a very large sum
of money for those coins.

07:01.072 --> 07:02.378

07:02.422 --> 07:04.032
One point five million, right?

07:04.075 --> 07:06.556
Yeah, I heard,
but that's, yeah...

07:06.600 --> 07:09.994
That's a drop in the
bucket for you, Owen.

07:10.038 --> 07:12.214

are you even here?

07:20.744 --> 07:24.356
You both share the same goal,
right?

07:24.400 --> 07:27.011
[whispering]:
Take down the Hudsons.

07:27.055 --> 07:29.318
You two should talk.

07:29.361 --> 07:31.712
Share information.

07:31.755 --> 07:34.062
Oh!

07:34.105 --> 07:36.238
Have some cake.

07:36.281 --> 07:38.762
Okay? Work together.

07:38.806 --> 07:41.112
Okay?

07:45.595 --> 07:47.162
Okay, come on, Drew.

07:47.205 --> 07:49.817
A quick search is not
gonna get anyone hurt.

07:57.781 --> 07:59.435
ACE: What are you doing?

07:59.479 --> 08:02.394
Nothing.

08:02.438 --> 08:04.919
Why are you looking
at a picture of my dad?

08:12.796 --> 08:14.885
Hey, you know, what-what
if we just told the cops?

08:14.929 --> 08:16.931
Your dad worked
on a case in 2003

08:16.974 --> 08:18.846
that had the same poison
that killed Tiffany.

08:18.889 --> 08:22.284
You stole Tiffany's blood
to get these test results.

08:22.327 --> 08:24.721
Think admitting to that
right before your arraignment's

08:24.765 --> 08:26.810
less than advisable.

08:26.854 --> 08:29.683
Now, before you meet
the Captain...

08:29.726 --> 08:31.728
You call your dad "the Captain"?

08:31.772 --> 08:33.861
Here's a few things
you should know.

08:33.904 --> 08:36.472
He doesn't like people much.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.779
He lost his hearing
after his accident on the force.

08:38.822 --> 08:40.650
He can read your lips,

08:40.694 --> 08:43.479
but he's little self-conscious
about speaking.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.438
And fair warning: my house
can be a bit of a war zone.

08:50.312 --> 08:52.314
Yeah, I can tell.

09:04.021 --> 09:06.023
No.

09:06.067 --> 09:08.460
I wanted you to meet somebody.

09:15.859 --> 09:18.645
Captain Thom?

09:18.688 --> 09:20.690
Uh, I'm-I'm Nancy Drew.

09:23.867 --> 09:25.869
The Hero of Horseshoe Bay?

09:25.913 --> 09:27.915
Yes. The one and only.

09:28.959 --> 09:30.831
Um,

09:30.874 --> 09:32.876
she wanted to ask you something.

09:34.356 --> 09:36.532
About Liza Ainslie.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.926
It's a suicide case in 2003.

09:38.969 --> 09:40.623
Do you remember her?

09:40.667 --> 09:42.843
I found her near her car

09:42.886 --> 09:44.192
with a vial of poison.

09:44.235 --> 09:46.803
It was ruled a suicide.

09:46.847 --> 09:48.892
But I never believed that.

09:51.852 --> 09:55.507
Tiffany Hudson was killed
by the same rare poison.

09:55.551 --> 09:59.163
I-I don't know who waits
15 years between kills, but...

10:17.181 --> 10:18.966
I received an e-mail

10:19.009 --> 10:20.271
the day before Liza died.

10:20.315 --> 10:22.752
And then the next year
I got another e-mail.

10:22.796 --> 10:25.320
And one more
the year after that.

10:26.364 --> 10:28.584
I think they're all
from the same killer.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.368
That has to be a cipher, right?

10:32.153 --> 10:34.329
Yeah, but I never cracked it.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.549

Except for Bess.
BESS: Hey!

36:30.275 --> 36:34.496
You know, I was dealing with
a delicate family situation.

36:34.540 --> 36:37.717
Nancy, I might still be in a
coma if it weren't for you.

36:37.760 --> 36:40.633
When I got possessed
by Tiffany, you chose me

36:40.676 --> 36:42.635
over questioning a ghost
about her own murder.

36:42.678 --> 36:44.767
Saved my life.
BESS: Yeah.

36:44.811 --> 36:46.726
And you let me live with you

36:46.769 --> 36:49.772
when I had nowhere else to go.

36:49.816 --> 36:52.253
NICK:
You helped me find
what Tiffany left for me.

36:52.297 --> 36:54.255
And you didn't turn me in
to the cops,

36:54.299 --> 36:56.126
even when you had reason to.

36:56.170 --> 36:57.737
NANCY:
But I've hurt you.

36:57.780 --> 36:59.304
I've hurt all of you.

36:59.347 --> 37:00.870
And... f-for what? Okay.

37:00.914 --> 37:03.656
Ease up on the guilt, Nancy.

37:03.699 --> 37:06.963
Okay? We all hurt
people we love.

37:07.007 --> 37:10.402
But we all forgive
the people we love, too.

37:12.012 --> 37:14.275
Right, George?

37:14.319 --> 37:16.321
Eh.

37:17.322 --> 37:19.672
Looks good on you.

37:19.715 --> 37:20.977
ACE:
For my next cake.

37:21.021 --> 37:22.588
GEORGE: Do you think you brought

37:22.631 --> 37:23.850
Dead Lucy back with you?

37:23.893 --> 37:26.113
NANCY:
I think she crawled her way out

37:26.156 --> 37:28.246
of wherever Simon flung her.

37:28.289 --> 37:30.813
Uh, she found me, though,

37:30.857 --> 37:33.425
when I was dying.

37:33.468 --> 37:37.255
I don't know if I brought her
back here, though.

37:37.298 --> 37:38.691
I don't know.
GEORGE: Okay.

37:38.734 --> 37:40.649
Drew looks tired.

37:40.693 --> 37:42.912
It's getting pretty late.
We should head out.

37:47.177 --> 37:48.657
See you in the morning.

37:48.701 --> 37:50.311
Good night, Nancy.

[door opens]

37:53.749 --> 37:56.143
So, she definitely wasn't
Tiffany's killer?

37:56.186 --> 37:59.755
No. We're getting
close, though.

37:59.799 --> 38:02.410
We know that it's the same
poison that killed Tiffany.

38:02.454 --> 38:04.760
We now know that it's
very hard to make.

38:04.804 --> 38:06.806
And there's an antidote.

38:06.849 --> 38:08.242
Good night.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.853
Good night, Ace.

we have to own up
to our failures

38:50.893 --> 38:53.635
