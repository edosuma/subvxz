- So what are we gonna do
about Crunchy?

09:29.413 --> 09:31.896
He's trying to manipulate us
to be his friends again.

09:31.965 --> 09:33.620
But we could wipe out
our entire debt

09:33.689 --> 09:35.000
by doing this one job.

09:35.068 --> 09:36.655
- Right, and here's the dream.

09:36.724 --> 09:38.000
If we pay off that whole thing,

09:38.068 --> 09:39.448
we can go mess
something else up

09:39.517 --> 09:41.206
and start paying that off.

09:41.275 --> 09:42.310
- Ugh.

09:42.379 --> 09:43.758
This is so hard.

09:43.827 --> 09:44.965
I mean, I wanna pay off
this debt

09:45.034 --> 09:46.482
but I don't wanna abandon you

09:46.551 --> 09:48.034
to dance with that jerk,
Crunchy.

09:48.103 --> 09:50.379
- Guys, guys.
Let me make this easy for you.

09:50.448 --> 09:52.034
'Cause I get
the pickle you're in.

09:52.103 --> 09:53.551
And you know how I feel
about pickles.

09:53.620 --> 09:54.965
While they're delicious,

09:55.034 --> 09:57.965
they're not a place one wants
to find oneself.

09:58.034 --> 10:00.206
- Okay, if I followed
your pickle story correctly,

10:00.275 --> 10:01.827
then I think we're dancing
with Crunchy.

10:01.896 --> 10:04.103
- Thank you for understanding,
Munchy.

10:04.172 --> 10:06.034
I guess we'll go
let Crunchy know.

10:06.103 --> 10:07.793
- Well, if we're not doing
the Munchy-Y,

10:07.862 --> 10:10.206
I guess I'll do the Munchy-Bye.

10:10.275 --> 10:12.931
Bye!

10:13.000 --> 10:15.034
[upbeat musical sting]

10:15.103 --> 10:16.620
- Hey, you can't cross
the street there!

10:16.689 --> 10:18.034
That's illegal!

10:18.103 --> 10:20.931
Too bad there's
no crossing guard nearby!

10:21.000 --> 10:23.517
- Crossing Guard Jaget is here!

10:23.586 --> 10:25.000
[exhales sharply]

10:25.068 --> 10:27.379
Wait.
I don't see anyone.

10:27.448 --> 10:29.448
- I thought that
was a guy jaywalking

10:29.517 --> 10:31.482
but it's just a window.

10:31.551 --> 10:33.758
So whatcha doing?

10:33.827 --> 10:35.965
You wanna hang out,
grab a bite,

10:36.034 --> 10:38.620
join my dance crew?

10:38.689 --> 10:41.758
- Nah.

10:41.827 --> 10:43.137
- Fine.

10:43.206 --> 10:44.931
I didn't want you
in my dance crew anyway.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.655
- Yes, you did.

10:46.724 --> 10:48.379
- Yes, I did.

10:51.482 --> 10:52.655
- Oh, Jaget.

10:52.724 --> 10:53.862
Good.
You're here.

10:53.931 --> 10:55.413
Can I talk to you
about something?

10:55.482 --> 10:57.000
- No time to talk.

10:57.068 --> 10:59.862
There was a report
of a jaywalker and-or a window.

10:59.931 --> 11:02.275
Either way, it's not safe.

11:04.172 --> 11:05.379
Okay.
We clear.

11:05.448 --> 11:06.896
What's up, Munchy?

11:06.965 --> 11:08.448
- Should I be upset?

11:08.517 --> 11:10.586
This kid, Crunchy,
offered to pay off our debt

11:10.655 --> 11:12.551
if the girls dance with him
in the competition.

11:12.620 --> 11:14.172
But really,

11:14.241 --> 11:16.137
he just wants to be friends
with them and drive me out.

11:16.206 --> 11:18.827
- Mm.
Been there.

11:18.896 --> 11:21.034
Friends fight over me
all the time.

11:21.103 --> 11:23.344
But obviously those two
turned him down, right?

11:23.413 --> 11:25.310
- They did not, big bro.

11:25.379 --> 11:28.000
- Well, did you tell 'em
how you feel in pickle terms?

11:28.068 --> 11:29.758
- Yes, but they took it
all wrong.

11:29.827 --> 11:32.862
Apparently, not everyone
understands pickles like we do.

11:32.931 --> 11:35.379
They're gonna dance
with Crunchy.

11:35.448 --> 11:37.689
- Then there's only
one thing to do.

11:37.758 --> 11:40.241
- Be honest with them?
- No!

11:40.310 --> 11:43.000
We will form
our own dance crew,

11:43.068 --> 11:45.551
enter the contest, and win.

11:45.620 --> 11:46.689
- That could be fun.

11:46.758 --> 11:49.586
- No!

11:49.655 --> 11:51.758
You can get revenge.

11:51.827 --> 11:53.551
- Fun revenge?

11:53.620 --> 11:56.344
- Revenge is always fun.

11:56.413 --> 11:58.896
- Oh, Fisher.
You wanna join our dance crew?

11:58.965 --> 12:00.310
- Dude, we wanna win.

12:00.379 --> 12:03.413
And there's no way
little science guy can dance.

12:04.413 --> 12:06.896
- If I can't dance,
then why did I invent sneakers

12:06.965 --> 12:10.000

into tap shoes?

Aren't we having fun?

12:52.413 --> 12:54.689
Just as much fun as you have
with Munchy, right?

12:54.758 --> 12:57.310
- So much.
- Super fun.

12:57.379 --> 13:00.275
- So what do you guys think
of the big finish to the dance?

13:00.344 --> 13:02.448
- Normally, we finish
on a big lift.

13:02.517 --> 13:04.517
- With Munchy, we were gonna
end with the Munchy-Y.

13:04.586 --> 13:05.689
- Ugh.

13:05.758 --> 13:08.000
I hate lifts and I hate Y's.

Are you a consonant or a vowel?
Pick one.

13:11.482 --> 13:13.827
- So should we try it once with
you actually dancing with us?

that we're going to compete

without Munchy.

I'm a Bunchie.

13:57.034 --> 13:58.448

- And together,
we're the Bunchies.

to the competition, lil bro?

What are you talking about?

And why are you guys
wearing the same outfit?

on the side.

your own dance crew?

14:29.517 --> 14:31.517
- Well, I did
because I just wanted--

14:31.586 --> 14:34.586
- Because after you two
broke his heart,

14:34.655 --> 14:36.068
he had no choice.

14:36.137 --> 14:37.517
- We broke your heart?

14:37.586 --> 14:39.310
Why didn't you say anything,
Munchy?

14:39.379 --> 14:41.793
- Yeah, you just talked
about pickles being delicious.

14:41.862 --> 14:42.896
- If you--

14:42.965 --> 14:44.413
- If you were real friends,

14:44.482 --> 14:47.586
you would know
how pickles feel.

for all of us.

his feelings crystal-clear.

20:31.241 --> 20:33.310
That's my son, Munchy.

Daddy's proud of you.

Uh, I mean...
[clears throat]

20:38.620 --> 20:42.000
They danced very well.

20:42.068 --> 20:44.931
I think it's pretty obvious
who's going to win this trophy.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.482
What do you think,
Luna the Tuna?

20:54.275 --> 20:57.137
- Crunchy?

20:57.206 --> 20:59.655
- Oh!
I can't believe it.

20:59.724 --> 21:02.379
The winner is me, Crunchy.

21:02.448 --> 21:05.586
This proves that with hard work
and paying off judges,

21:05.655 --> 21:07.448
you can win in the end.

21:07.517 --> 21:09.448
Presley and Lex,
you could be up here,

21:09.517 --> 21:10.758
but you're losers.

21:10.827 --> 21:13.448
Hope your dumb friend
Munchy is worth it.

21:13.517 --> 21:15.344
- "Dumb friend Munchy?"

21:15.413 --> 21:17.034
That's my son.

21:17.103 --> 21:18.379
Give me that trophy.

21:18.448 --> 21:21.172
I'd rather anyone win but you.

21:21.241 --> 21:23.965
- [laughing]
Yes!

21:24.034 --> 21:26.655
I'm anyone!

21:26.724 --> 21:30.344
We won!
We did it, boys.

21:30.413 --> 21:32.689
- Hey.
I won that.

21:32.758 --> 21:34.448
Grieves, get that trophy back.

21:34.517 --> 21:36.172
- No.
I quit.

21:36.241 --> 21:39.586
Luna the Tuna is using
the gold card to hire me.

21:40.586 --> 21:42.413
- Fine.
I don't need you.

21:42.482 --> 21:43.482
I don't need anybody.

21:44.896 --> 21:48.137
I don't know how to get home.

21:48.206 --> 21:51.413
- I can't believe my dad won.

21:51.482 --> 21:53.034
- It's okay.

21:53.103 --> 21:56.103
We may have lost, but we lost
together as friends.

21:56.172 --> 21:58.448
- This is why you're
our favorite Unchy.

22:02.793 --> 22:05.172

Got room for three more?
