WEBVTT

00:00.596 --> 00:02.764
- I wanna scrub in.
- We don't need you up here.

00:02.789 --> 00:05.037
- You're a trauma surgeon, June.
- Without an effective treatment,

00:05.062 --> 00:06.319
he'll die before she gets to know him.

00:06.344 --> 00:07.897
You're solving a problem, Dr. Leblanc,

00:07.922 --> 00:09.698
that he may not want you to solve.

00:09.723 --> 00:11.812
I don't understand. I caught
up with rent last month

00:11.837 --> 00:14.305
- I'm sorry, Bashir.
- I have two bedrooms.

00:46.621 --> 00:48.633
It's a lot.

00:50.225 --> 00:53.721
I want to help, I want this to work.

00:54.778 --> 00:58.392
I know he's excited about retiring.

00:58.488 --> 01:02.157
I want to help him get
ready for that, I do.

01:02.613 --> 01:05.586
But I'm still working here now, alright?

01:05.611 --> 01:07.843
For a few more months, anyways. So...

01:08.892 --> 01:11.614
Can you just talk to him for me?

01:12.810 --> 01:14.361
Yeah.

01:33.073 --> 01:34.887
Amira?

01:40.575 --> 01:41.937
Everything alright?

01:42.158 --> 01:44.730
My brother's not back?

01:45.366 --> 01:47.067
No. He's still at work.

01:47.914 --> 01:50.695
Is it okay if I wait for him?

01:51.316 --> 01:53.155
Yeah. Of course.

02:06.391 --> 02:07.842
How was Amira this morning?

02:07.867 --> 02:10.217
Tired. Sorry if she
worried you last night.

02:10.241 --> 02:13.077
Grace wakes up like that
sometimes after a nightmare.

02:13.112 --> 02:15.647
She's been displaced so many times.

02:15.794 --> 02:17.693
You're there for her,
that's all that matters.

02:17.908 --> 02:20.592
I had to leave Lenny on
the side of the road.

02:20.617 --> 02:22.295
- Who's Lenny?
- That's her car.

02:22.320 --> 02:23.866
You have a car named Lenny?

02:23.891 --> 02:26.022
Yes. And he's got, like,
a cracked engine block,

02:26.047 --> 02:27.303
and he needs a new transmission

02:27.328 --> 02:29.248
That's probably more than the car costs.

02:29.273 --> 02:31.710
I bought that car when I was 17
years old with my own money.

02:31.735 --> 02:33.436
He's got me through
university, med school,

02:33.461 --> 02:36.096
and an entire leg of
Sleater-Kinney's reunion tour

02:36.144 --> 02:37.564
Hey. Excuse me.

02:37.589 --> 02:39.655
- Are you a doctor?
- Yeah, how can I help?

02:40.857 --> 02:42.764
You should've helped me
when you had the chance!

02:42.789 --> 02:44.241
- Security!
- Back off!

02:44.266 --> 02:46.686
- Get off me!
- Hey, hey, hey!

02:46.711 --> 02:49.280
- We got this. We got this.
- Get off me!

02:53.233 --> 02:54.758
Are you okay?

02:57.023 --> 02:58.876
Here. Take this.

03:12.814 --> 03:17.779
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:20.288 --> 03:21.935
I know I'm late, sir.
Won't happen again.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.249
Actually, you're right on time.

03:23.274 --> 03:24.795
No, it's just Theo
this morning, I was...

03:24.820 --> 03:27.053
Why did you choose emergency
medicine, Dr. Leblanc?

03:27.078 --> 03:29.553
I know for a fact you could've
had your pick of residencies.

03:29.578 --> 03:30.866
- Why this one?
- Uh...

03:31.337 --> 03:33.506
Because in Emerg, you can't
just be good at one thing.

03:33.531 --> 03:34.969
You gotta be the best at everything.

03:34.994 --> 03:36.194
And are you?

03:36.358 --> 03:37.558
Well, I...

03:37.583 --> 03:39.835
I definitely have things to work on.
But...

03:39.929 --> 03:41.594
Do you know what the minimum expectation

03:41.619 --> 03:43.273
of patients treated per shift is?

03:43.298 --> 03:45.046
- Twenty.
- And...

03:45.242 --> 03:47.710
What do you think your average is?

03:48.050 --> 03:49.717
- Less.
- Fifteen.

03:49.742 --> 03:51.839
You're saying I need to move faster.
I can do that.

03:51.864 --> 03:55.028
I'm saying there's a reason you don't.

03:55.435 --> 03:57.492
You spend too much time per case.

03:57.517 --> 03:59.687
Your patient histories
are more comprehensive

03:59.712 --> 04:01.077
than any other resident.

04:01.102 --> 04:03.103
Well, isn't that why I
catch as much as I do?

04:03.128 --> 04:04.295
You catch too much.

04:04.345 --> 04:06.538
You actively look for problems to solve.

04:06.602 --> 04:08.736
What we do here is present tense.

04:08.761 --> 04:11.077
The drive-through
instead of fine dining.

04:11.102 --> 04:13.584
We treat what they came for.
We admit them if they need it,

04:13.609 --> 04:14.874
cut them loose if they don't.

04:14.899 --> 04:16.233
You've never raised this before

04:16.257 --> 04:18.843
Well, now that you're reaching
the end of your second year,

04:18.868 --> 04:21.140
it's a good time to
correct any bad habits

04:21.165 --> 04:22.749
before they become a pattern.

04:23.156 --> 04:25.749
Which is why you're going to
be evaluated today, by me.

04:25.774 --> 04:27.519
Who do we have waiting
this morning, Claire?

04:27.544 --> 04:29.054
Uh, we gotta head lac,

04:29.079 --> 04:32.607
we've got an ankle sprain,
and a senior with a fever.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.608
I'll start with the fever.

04:35.020 --> 04:36.354
Here you go!

04:44.654 --> 04:47.444
Mm. What I wouldn't give
for a large cup of coffee.

04:47.469 --> 04:50.213
Uh, Doctor? Uh, doctor...?

04:50.238 --> 04:52.300
- Hamed.
- Hamed. Javier.

04:52.410 --> 04:55.535
Um... My wife Maria, she's got this flu.

04:55.560 --> 04:56.879
Javy, mi amor.

04:56.929 --> 04:59.684
I know, I'm just explaining. Um, and...

04:59.888 --> 05:02.999
We just wanted to make sure there
isn't anything we should be doing.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.519
We're headed up to OB, so no
need to bother the doctor.

05:05.544 --> 05:07.269
No, it's not a problem,

05:07.315 --> 05:08.824
They'll listen to the baby

05:08.849 --> 05:11.563
and probably ask you to take
it easy for a couple of days.

05:12.749 --> 05:15.589
- Okay. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

05:15.833 --> 05:17.986
And ask to check out that rash.

05:23.148 --> 05:24.826
Thank you.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.626
Thanks.

05:30.316 --> 05:31.916
Yeah, it's broken.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.435
Hey, thanks for coming to my rescue.

05:34.460 --> 05:35.877
Did they find out who the guy was?

05:35.902 --> 05:38.339
Supposedly he was waiting for a doctor,

05:38.364 --> 05:40.870
and I guess he got tired of waiting.

05:40.895 --> 05:43.394
And just needed someone
to take it out on?

05:43.419 --> 05:45.753
The way you jumped in, uh...

05:46.420 --> 05:48.587
Guessing you've had to do
that kind of thing before?

05:48.743 --> 05:50.769
Doesn't mean you get used to it.

05:50.958 --> 05:52.526
Well, I've never been in a fight.

05:52.551 --> 05:54.003
I wouldn't exactly call that a fight.

05:54.028 --> 05:56.229
A stranger came out of nowhere
and punched you in the face.

05:56.254 --> 05:57.862
- That's...
- Twice.

05:58.212 --> 05:59.987
And I didn't do anything
to try to stop him.

06:00.012 --> 06:02.238
I just... froze.

06:04.079 --> 06:07.558
Hey, I can... I can cover your
patients if you want to go home.

06:08.041 --> 06:09.608
I don't have to leave.

06:09.956 --> 06:12.358
Well, if you just want to
take a break for an hour.

06:12.383 --> 06:14.400
No, I'm good. Thanks, Bash.

06:15.129 --> 06:16.961
Thanks for the coffee.

06:19.118 --> 06:21.841
Your surgical attending has
you transwriting charts?

06:21.866 --> 06:23.695
Sutures, cyst drainage,

06:23.720 --> 06:25.705
foreign body removal, more sutures.

06:25.730 --> 06:27.713
If he's in a really good
mood, I get to suction.

06:27.738 --> 06:29.348
They call it paying your dues.

06:29.373 --> 06:30.573
So I've been told.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.588
I know Singh's work takes precedence

06:32.613 --> 06:34.658
over anything you pick
up down here, but...

06:34.835 --> 06:36.293
if you get a second,

06:36.318 --> 06:39.234
I have a woman in curtain
four with a runny nose.

06:39.259 --> 06:40.960
Don't tell me she needs suction

06:40.985 --> 06:42.742
Actually, it's a bit of a mystery.

06:42.767 --> 06:45.156
Been going on three years.

06:45.370 --> 06:47.116
No signs of infection.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.546
Okay, Mrs. Willis.

06:53.685 --> 06:56.750
Well, based on what I can see
here, I think it's just a flu.

06:56.775 --> 06:58.633
So, I'm gonna put you in an IV

06:58.658 --> 07:01.757
to rehydrate you, and give you
acetaminophen for the fever.

07:01.782 --> 07:05.984
I worried when the dizzy
spells got worse.

07:06.009 --> 07:09.146
The dizzy spells, you didn't, you
didn't mention that to triage.

07:09.171 --> 07:13.171
Oh, that nurse was so busy,
I didn't want to bother.

07:13.196 --> 07:14.697
No, that's no bother.

07:15.443 --> 07:17.178
How long has that been going on?

07:17.203 --> 07:18.559
A few weeks.

07:18.584 --> 07:21.720
My doctor says it's a neural thing?

07:21.745 --> 07:24.016
Mm... And are you diabetic?

07:24.041 --> 07:25.737
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

07:26.011 --> 07:28.843
Is it possible he called
it peripheral neuropathy?

07:28.868 --> 07:31.661
Um... That sounds right.

07:32.189 --> 07:35.101
I... I wrote the name down.

07:35.126 --> 07:36.922
- But I...
- Well, if it's neuropathy,

07:36.947 --> 07:39.251
an inhibitor may not be
the best course of action

07:40.729 --> 07:42.839
I'm gonna do some tests, okay?

07:42.864 --> 07:45.634
Okay, thank you.

07:45.659 --> 07:47.176
Of course.

07:57.167 --> 07:59.203
<i>Excuse me, are you a doctor?</i>

07:59.871 --> 08:03.568
- Back off!
- We got this! We got this!

08:04.170 --> 08:06.361
<i>Are you okay?</i>

08:10.453 --> 08:13.326
Mrs. Rawana? Hi, I'm Dr. Curtis.

08:13.351 --> 08:15.219
I hear you have quite the runny nose.

08:15.460 --> 08:16.844
I didn't want to come in,

08:16.869 --> 08:20.164
but my daughter made me after
it started getting worse.

08:20.189 --> 08:21.752
Take a breath.

08:22.496 --> 08:24.047
Sit up.

08:25.611 --> 08:27.078
It's getting worse?

08:27.103 --> 08:29.882
I'm used to getting
up with a wet pillow.

08:29.907 --> 08:32.835
The last few days it's been
more like a pond than a puddle.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.139
Mm.

08:35.025 --> 08:38.131
Okay, and you've spoken to
your family doctor about this?

08:38.157 --> 08:39.898
She says I have bad allergies,

08:39.923 --> 08:43.131
and sent me to an ear, nose and throat
doctor who said the same thing.

08:43.164 --> 08:44.953
They put me on this medication.

08:44.978 --> 08:46.083
Diphenhydramine.

08:46.108 --> 08:47.805
It makes me drowsy.

08:47.830 --> 08:50.875
What's the point in feeling that
way if it's not even helping?

08:50.900 --> 08:53.450
Well, I'm gonna have a look, okay?

08:54.394 --> 08:56.329
Can you open your mouth?

09:00.101 --> 09:02.188
Is your family from the Caribbean?

09:02.250 --> 09:04.018
Jamaica, but my parents met here.

09:04.119 --> 09:05.619
I was born in Trinidad.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.254
My husband, too.

09:07.875 --> 09:11.552
Your parents must be so proud of you.

09:11.764 --> 09:13.887
Beautiful black woman.

09:13.912 --> 09:15.430
Big city doctor.

09:16.214 --> 09:17.715
No pain?

09:18.213 --> 09:19.647
Anyway...

09:19.672 --> 09:23.406
I'm sure you tell them the same
thing our daughter tells us.

09:23.437 --> 09:26.015
Be proud, be supportive,

09:26.045 --> 09:28.152
but do it from the sidelines.

09:29.381 --> 09:32.239
How long have you had that
bump on your collarbone?

09:32.517 --> 09:34.752
Is it something I should
be concerned about?

09:34.822 --> 09:36.601
Not necessarily, but I'll...

09:36.626 --> 09:38.078
I'll have a closer look.

09:39.610 --> 09:41.945
Can I get a CT and labs on Mrs. Willis?

09:41.970 --> 09:43.930
Mrs. Willis, that's the
elderly lady with the flu?

09:43.955 --> 09:45.364
Yeah, she's having dizzy spells.

09:45.389 --> 09:47.106
We need to call her GP for a history.

09:47.131 --> 09:49.199
I won't let it slow me down.

09:49.710 --> 09:51.677
How's doctor Hunter today?

09:51.702 --> 09:53.500
He's had better mornings.

09:54.223 --> 09:55.505
Doctor Hamed?

09:55.530 --> 09:56.805
Hey, is everything okay?

09:56.981 --> 09:58.662
OB is very busy today.

09:58.687 --> 10:00.610
They said they could see
us, but not for a while.

10:00.635 --> 10:01.938
Maria's very tired,

10:01.963 --> 10:03.367
I just want her to be seen.

10:03.392 --> 10:05.710
We were wondering if you could
check her and the baby out?

10:05.735 --> 10:07.135
No problem. Follow me.

10:08.056 --> 10:09.796
Blood pressure's normal.

10:10.083 --> 10:11.583
You must be getting excited.

10:11.608 --> 10:13.023
Over the moon.

10:13.079 --> 10:14.656
- How many weeks?
- Thirty-one.

10:14.681 --> 10:16.015
And tell me about your symptoms.

10:16.040 --> 10:18.896
We spent the weekend at a
friend's cottage up north.

10:18.921 --> 10:21.679
I started to feel nauseous
on the car ride back.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.304
- And this was yesterday?
- Uh-huh.

10:23.329 --> 10:26.758
I thought it was car sickness,
but this morning I had a fever.

10:26.783 --> 10:29.828
And then we started to worry that
the baby wasn't moving as much,

10:29.853 --> 10:32.570
but um, we couldn't be sure, so...

10:32.711 --> 10:34.212
Let's take a look.

10:34.383 --> 10:36.617
Sorry, I know it's a little cold.

10:40.378 --> 10:41.779
That sound's good, right?

10:41.804 --> 10:43.571
Yes. Very good.

10:45.117 --> 10:46.773
Do you know the gender of the baby?

10:46.798 --> 10:48.773
Because I think I can tell. No spoilers!

10:48.798 --> 10:52.149
Sorry, we've just waited this long,

10:52.174 --> 10:54.227
and we want to go the distance.

10:54.252 --> 10:55.862
I completely understand.

10:55.887 --> 10:58.016
Well, everything seems normal,

10:58.041 --> 11:00.042
baby seems healthy,
blood pressure is good,

11:00.067 --> 11:01.868
so you can sit up.

11:02.136 --> 11:04.791
But there is one more
thing I should look at.

11:05.222 --> 11:08.766
Um, how long have you had
that rash on your arm?

11:08.941 --> 11:12.829
I scraped myself on the
dock at the cottage,

11:12.854 --> 11:15.468
climbing down to the
water to go for a swim.

11:17.261 --> 11:19.555
- Any pain?
- A bit.

11:19.580 --> 11:21.228
But I bruise easily.

11:21.498 --> 11:23.141
That's all it is, right?

11:23.307 --> 11:25.555
Uh, we just need to make sure.

11:25.641 --> 11:28.814
I need to make an incision,
prep the Lidocaine.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.946
Are, are you worried about something?

11:31.971 --> 11:34.915
If there's an infection, we just
need to know how to manage it.

11:35.531 --> 11:37.231
It's okay.

11:37.883 --> 11:39.537
- Hi.
- Hi, love.

11:43.761 --> 11:45.664
- Do you feel anything?
- No.

11:46.079 --> 11:48.946
- You may want to look away.
- Oh, he's the squeamish one.

11:48.971 --> 11:51.379
I have other skills.

11:53.165 --> 11:55.425
Ah. Okay.

11:59.670 --> 12:01.513
Oh. What is that?

12:02.161 --> 12:04.099
Is there a problem?

12:12.864 --> 12:15.143
Hey. Are you okay?

12:16.120 --> 12:17.985
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

12:18.226 --> 12:21.064
Bishop's putting me through
the wringer today.

12:22.471 --> 12:23.738
What's wrong?

12:23.901 --> 12:25.502
I'm a waiting on rush labs.

12:25.527 --> 12:27.292
I have a 31 weeks pregnant woman

12:27.317 --> 12:29.089
who seems to have a
very serious infection.

12:29.114 --> 12:30.792
31 weeks? Why is she not in OB?

12:30.817 --> 12:33.198
They were swamped, so the
couple came to me directly.

12:33.283 --> 12:35.362
You know, I'd offer to
help, but I'm just...

12:35.387 --> 12:36.953
I'm trying to stay focused because...

12:36.978 --> 12:38.495
Don't worry about it.

12:38.810 --> 12:40.553
What kind of infection?

12:50.304 --> 12:52.477
- Dr. Bishop?
- Yeah, what is it?

12:52.502 --> 12:54.926
I've got a 36-year-old
woman, 31 weeks pregnant

12:54.951 --> 12:56.944
and presenting with
flesh-eating bacteria.

13:02.157 --> 13:05.244
I have never seen necrotizing
fasciitis in a pregnant woman.

13:05.269 --> 13:07.634
Neither have I. Have you
treated this infection before?

13:07.659 --> 13:10.166
No sir, but I have seen
numerous cases of gangrene.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.800
Then you know we have to move fast.

13:11.825 --> 13:13.585
You've started her on antibiotics?

13:13.610 --> 13:16.490
600 milligrams of IV Clinda
and 2 grams of IV Ancef.

13:16.515 --> 13:18.611
She's already on fluids.
How'd she contract it?

13:18.636 --> 13:20.175
She scraped herself on a dock.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.424
- And the baby?
- Fetal heart rate's normal.

13:22.449 --> 13:26.050
Sepsis from infection can cause
stillbirth or miscarriage.

13:26.075 --> 13:28.580
Well, it's presenting on her
upper arm, just above the elbow,

13:28.605 --> 13:31.140
so hopefully we can control
it and limit spread.

13:31.165 --> 13:33.236
We'll do an MRI, see if that's the case.

13:33.261 --> 13:34.563
And then what, Dr. Hamed?

13:34.588 --> 13:37.022
Assuming it hasn't spread,
what are her options?

13:37.047 --> 13:38.881
Uh, radical debridement.

13:38.906 --> 13:40.683
But that means putting her under.

13:40.708 --> 13:42.997
Extremely risky for a pregnant woman.

13:43.022 --> 13:44.816
The only other option is amputation,

13:44.841 --> 13:47.077
and she'll need a general
anaesthetic either way.

13:47.102 --> 13:49.558
Well, the decision has to be
the patient's ultimately.

13:49.583 --> 13:51.519
I'll reach out to infectious diseases,

13:51.544 --> 13:53.457
start a dialogue with a surgeon.

13:53.482 --> 13:55.503
I'll talk to Maria.

13:58.050 --> 14:00.722
Are... Are you talking about

14:00.885 --> 14:02.886
cutting off my arm?

14:02.963 --> 14:05.345
If you choose this option, yes.

14:08.002 --> 14:10.855
And this other option, debridement?

14:10.880 --> 14:12.667
- It means I get to keep it?
- Yes.

14:12.692 --> 14:13.785
But you have to understand,

14:13.810 --> 14:16.480
amputation increases the
likelihood that we get everything.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.964
Debridment means cutting out
only the infected tissue,

14:18.989 --> 14:21.487
but the risk of the bacteria
spreading are higher.

14:22.392 --> 14:24.526
I should have never gone for that swim.

14:24.551 --> 14:26.753
- Maria, don't say that.
- No, Javier, you can't.

14:26.778 --> 14:29.157
The infection is dangerous
and aggressive.

14:29.182 --> 14:31.339
Am I not already exposed?

14:31.364 --> 14:33.957
Let's hope not. And we
cannot take that chance.

14:33.982 --> 14:35.519
And these antibiotics,

14:35.544 --> 14:37.785
are you sure they won't harm our baby?

14:37.810 --> 14:39.475
Your baby is safe for now.

14:39.500 --> 14:42.882
The best predictor of the baby
doing well is you doing well.

14:43.593 --> 14:45.093
Which means...

14:46.068 --> 14:48.029
we need to decide.

14:48.481 --> 14:51.098
How is this happening now?

14:51.333 --> 14:54.562
We've tried for so long for this baby!

14:54.924 --> 14:57.731
That's all we've thought
about for years!

14:57.884 --> 15:00.044
A surgeon is coming to
talk to you shortly.

15:00.077 --> 15:03.487
But any delay will put your life
and your baby's life in danger.

15:03.512 --> 15:06.464
- This is crazy. We need time...
- Debridement.

15:07.026 --> 15:08.743
I want the debridement.

15:09.176 --> 15:10.867
No, M-Maria,

15:10.892 --> 15:14.205
I want to hold our child in my arms.

15:14.661 --> 15:16.996
Rock my baby to sleep.

15:20.050 --> 15:21.922
Annette Rawana, 55-years-old,

15:22.058 --> 15:23.381
persistent runny nose.

15:23.406 --> 15:24.757
If you look really closely,

15:24.782 --> 15:26.905
you can actually see
the hole in her dura.

15:26.930 --> 15:29.031
There. Yeah. Turns out
cerebrospinal fluid

15:29.056 --> 15:31.077
has been leaking from her
brain into her sinuses.

15:31.297 --> 15:34.491
She's seen her GP multiple
times about this,

15:34.516 --> 15:37.840
even an ENT who thought it was mucus.
But it's not.

15:37.865 --> 15:39.366
It's brain fluid.

15:39.794 --> 15:43.163
Is this a genetic
malformation of the dura?

15:43.188 --> 15:47.202
Nope. I found a small
deformity on her collarbone.

15:47.227 --> 15:49.295
It's not the cause of the
leak, but it is a clue.

15:49.320 --> 15:51.749
So turns out three years
ago, she had a minor fall.

15:51.774 --> 15:54.632
Yeah. She was at the park with her
grandson, fractures her clavicle.

15:54.657 --> 15:56.324
The bone didn't heal properly.

15:56.349 --> 15:58.639
Not uncommon in a patient over 50.
But...

15:58.694 --> 16:01.417
There was a small basal skull fracture
that they missed at the time,

16:01.442 --> 16:02.886
resulting in a dural defect.

16:02.911 --> 16:04.983
It's been asymptomatic until now.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.065
If you hadn't caught this,

16:07.090 --> 16:11.780
she would have had severe
seizures, or even meningitis.

16:12.070 --> 16:14.392
Tom, check this out.

16:15.398 --> 16:17.933
Three-year runny nose. Total mystery.

16:17.958 --> 16:20.648
ENT thought it was mucus.

16:21.327 --> 16:24.110
Wow, you can barely see
the hole on the scan.

16:24.359 --> 16:25.560
Nice catch.

16:25.716 --> 16:28.113
I'll put it on the
neuro-board, and book an OR.

16:31.446 --> 16:34.120
Oh come on, he said nice catch.

16:43.855 --> 16:45.509
That's a good look for a doctor.

16:45.921 --> 16:48.686
Just so you know, the police
are charging the gentleman.

16:48.711 --> 16:51.646
Turns out he has a history
of anger problems.

16:51.671 --> 16:53.718
- Is it broken?
- I'm fine.

16:53.743 --> 16:57.210
Ah. We take assault against
our staff very seriously.

16:57.235 --> 16:59.327
Even if they are only here temporarily.

16:59.405 --> 17:02.147
I noticed you hadn't submitted or
the full-time pediatrics position.

17:02.172 --> 17:03.965
Applications are open
for two more weeks.

17:03.990 --> 17:05.646
Wife didn't go for it, huh? Thank you.

17:05.672 --> 17:09.029
Figured it's more of an in-person
conversation next time I was home.

17:09.054 --> 17:10.093
Smart man.

17:10.117 --> 17:12.608
These things never work out
unless you're both same page.

17:13.189 --> 17:15.560
How do you feel today, Eva?

17:15.586 --> 17:17.944
- Okay.
- That's good.

17:17.969 --> 17:20.984
Eva was diagnosed with
epilepsy a few months ago.

17:21.010 --> 17:23.388
We've been learning to manage
the seizures but this morning

17:23.414 --> 17:25.656
she wasn't herself, then
started throwing up.

17:25.897 --> 17:28.381
We weren't sure if it was
related to the epilepsy.

17:28.792 --> 17:30.693
Is purple your favourite colour, Eva?

17:30.718 --> 17:31.883
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

17:31.908 --> 17:36.264
My daughter's favourite
is pink sparkly rainbow.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.141
Okay. It's good.

17:39.513 --> 17:41.280
What happened to your nose?

17:41.305 --> 17:43.633
To my nose? Uh...

17:43.865 --> 17:45.367
I told a lie,

17:45.473 --> 17:47.344
so it grew like Pinocchio's.

17:47.617 --> 17:49.459
You're worried you
might've missed a seizure?

17:49.484 --> 17:51.165
Maybe while she was asleep.

17:51.190 --> 17:52.777
She doesn't wear the helmet at night

17:52.802 --> 17:55.552
If she hit her head, a concussion
would explain the nausea.

17:55.577 --> 17:57.872
I keep a detailed journal
of all her seizures,

17:57.897 --> 18:00.112
and she's never had one
in her sleep before.

18:00.425 --> 18:02.386
Couldn't the vomiting
be related to the flu?

18:02.411 --> 18:05.713
It's possible, but she
isn't running a fever.

18:05.905 --> 18:08.807
Eva, do you remember bumping
your head last night?

18:08.832 --> 18:10.067
- Mm-mm.
- No?

18:10.092 --> 18:12.433
Okay, I'm gonna take a look
while you play with that.

18:12.503 --> 18:13.754
There you go.

18:14.256 --> 18:15.721
Okay.

18:16.948 --> 18:20.925
Well, I don't see any
evidence of head injury,

18:20.950 --> 18:22.691
but we'll run some tests

18:22.716 --> 18:24.581
to get a sense of whether
or not these symptoms

18:24.613 --> 18:26.213
have anything to do with epilepsy.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.834
This is all so new for us.

18:27.859 --> 18:29.777
Well, we have a great
social workers here,

18:29.802 --> 18:32.037
if you need support while
you're adjusting to it all.

18:32.062 --> 18:33.761
Our church family's been amazing.

18:33.786 --> 18:35.879
Sending meals, offering rides.

18:35.904 --> 18:37.353
They've really shown up for us.

18:37.378 --> 18:39.965
Well, a strong community can
make a lot of difference.

18:39.990 --> 18:41.830
My Dad's a pastor in Sudbury.

18:41.855 --> 18:43.956
I go every Sunday when I'm home.

18:43.981 --> 18:46.769
You mentioned testing.
What kind, exactly?

18:46.794 --> 18:49.441
A CT and an EEG.

18:49.586 --> 18:52.422
But it won't hurt, we're just gonna
take a picture of your brain.

18:52.455 --> 18:56.487
What are the chances the
pastor's son is our doctor?

18:56.512 --> 18:58.910
A nurse will be by to get
you when it's time, okay?

18:58.935 --> 19:00.984
I'm gonna get that off your hands, okay?

19:01.009 --> 19:03.601
Thank you very much.

19:05.032 --> 19:07.352
Why haven't I seen the CT
results for Mrs. Willis?

19:07.377 --> 19:09.453
- She hasn't been.
- Why not?

19:09.478 --> 19:10.844
Because she doesn't need it.

19:10.869 --> 19:12.625
Sir, she has peripheral neuropathy

19:12.650 --> 19:14.757
and I just wanted to find the cause

19:14.945 --> 19:16.793
I read her chart. She came in with flu.

19:16.818 --> 19:18.352
That doesn't require a CAT scan.

19:18.377 --> 19:21.031
Her GP has her on an SSRI instead
of treating the nerve pain.

19:21.056 --> 19:22.617
Well, maybe there's a very
good reason for that.

19:22.642 --> 19:24.289
Maybe they tried antiseizure drugs

19:24.314 --> 19:25.977
for her neuropathic pain
and they didn't work

19:26.002 --> 19:27.530
No, I called for a history.
They haven't.

19:27.555 --> 19:30.078
- I can help her.
- You have helped her.

19:30.204 --> 19:32.493
You treated her dehydration and fever.

19:32.541 --> 19:34.539
Now you send her back to her
primary care physician,

19:34.564 --> 19:36.281
and you help someone else.

19:36.306 --> 19:37.734
That's the system.

19:37.759 --> 19:39.375
I'm on track for my twenty patients.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.222
Have you caught up on your charts?

19:41.247 --> 19:42.532
Have you even take a lunch?

19:42.557 --> 19:45.469
The extra time you spend digging
in, it has to come from somewhere.

19:45.494 --> 19:46.742
I don't mind sacrificing lunch

19:46.767 --> 19:48.696
if it means I can help a
patient solve a problem.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.984
This job's about balance, doctor.

19:51.170 --> 19:54.436
See everything, solve what's necessary.

19:58.478 --> 20:00.946
I wouldn't push her if I didn't
think she could handle it.

20:01.028 --> 20:02.610
I didn't say anything.

20:03.212 --> 20:06.081
Hey, how was your lunch with
your son the other day?

20:06.242 --> 20:08.310
Brief.

20:24.284 --> 20:26.847
- Hi.
<i>- Hey. Where are you?</i>

20:27.542 --> 20:29.076
Home.

20:29.101 --> 20:31.105
You mean the old apartment?

20:31.950 --> 20:34.942
If you know where I am,
why are you asking?

20:35.390 --> 20:37.279
The building manager saw you.

20:37.304 --> 20:38.471
Did you...

20:38.496 --> 20:40.130
Did you go back to see Daneesha?

20:40.155 --> 20:41.622
<i>No.</i>

20:42.078 --> 20:44.339
Amira, you can't just go
roaming around the city.

20:44.364 --> 20:46.747
I need to know where you are
and where you're going.

20:46.964 --> 20:48.701
I didn't mean to!

20:48.726 --> 20:50.960
I just got on the bus without thinking.

20:50.985 --> 20:53.292
It's not a big deal, okay?

20:53.396 --> 20:55.231
Okay. Okay.

20:55.256 --> 20:57.104
We only just got used to it here.

20:57.129 --> 20:59.463
It's the first place that felt like home

20:59.488 --> 21:01.700
since we left Mama and Baba's.

21:01.725 --> 21:03.956
I know it's hard, Habibti, but...

21:03.981 --> 21:06.642
we have to keep moving forward. Mm?

21:09.963 --> 21:11.522
Can you get to Theo's on your own?

21:11.547 --> 21:12.580
<i>Yes.</i>

21:12.605 --> 21:14.942
I'll be fine. I'll see you later, okay?

21:14.967 --> 21:16.443
Okay.

21:23.961 --> 21:25.536
Are you okay?

21:31.915 --> 21:34.544
We tried to conceive for two years.

21:37.317 --> 21:40.049
Three failed rounds of in-vitro.

21:42.627 --> 21:44.546
I took a night job,

21:44.878 --> 21:48.141
Maria took extra freelance work, and...

21:48.471 --> 21:51.017
Every single time a cycle didn't work,

21:51.042 --> 21:54.772
and she would get the news,
and it destroyed her.

21:57.523 --> 22:00.821
And then, and then it worked.

22:01.323 --> 22:03.616
We're gonna have a baby.

22:05.441 --> 22:09.496
And now all I can think
is, is it all worth it?

22:09.658 --> 22:11.664
Hey, it will be.

22:11.876 --> 22:14.321
Okay? As soon as she's done,
we'll get her into an MRI

22:14.346 --> 22:17.003
to make sure the bacteria hasn't spread.

22:19.341 --> 22:20.882
Thank you.

22:37.087 --> 22:38.333
Really?

22:38.638 --> 22:41.282
Well, if you're sure that's
all I can do, then fine.

22:41.671 --> 22:43.493
- Who died?
- Lenny.

22:43.885 --> 22:45.157
My car.

22:45.320 --> 22:46.884
He would need a new engine.

22:46.909 --> 22:49.332
Maybe it's time for an upgrade.
Something awesome, like a Mustang.

22:49.357 --> 22:51.450
I don't want a Mustang, I want Lenny.

22:51.693 --> 22:54.509
I hear Singh and Duncan
figured out what was going on

22:54.534 --> 22:57.668
- with your patient's runny nose?
- Something like that.

22:57.859 --> 22:59.728
Play the long game, Dr. Curtis.

23:00.232 --> 23:01.913
Suck it up and be excellent.

23:01.938 --> 23:04.509
When the dust settles,
you'll be miles beyond them.

23:04.929 --> 23:06.402
What was that about?

23:06.427 --> 23:08.088
Some unsolicited career advice

23:08.113 --> 23:11.447
from a woman who hasn't exactly
cracked the glass ceiling.

23:11.472 --> 23:12.880
That's not fair, she's an attending.

23:12.905 --> 23:14.686
Maybe she's right where she wants to be.

23:14.711 --> 23:16.580
Oh yeah? Stuck as Bishop's second?

23:16.605 --> 23:18.341
He's not exactly easy to please.

23:18.366 --> 23:19.857
I'm not interested in pleasing anyone.

23:19.882 --> 23:21.556
- I know, I know.
- And I don't need her advice.

23:21.581 --> 23:22.581
Alright, alright.

23:22.606 --> 23:24.238
Alright? Everything
that I have in my life,

23:24.263 --> 23:25.963
- I got...
- on my own, I know.

23:25.988 --> 23:27.222
You know, on my own.

23:27.247 --> 23:28.713
I'm just saying, maybe, you know,

23:28.738 --> 23:30.508
she's legitimately trying to help you.

23:30.533 --> 23:33.377
Yeah? Like Bishop's trying to help you?

23:33.869 --> 23:35.589
He's saying I over-diagnose.

23:35.614 --> 23:37.417
He's got me doubting my whole approach.

23:37.442 --> 23:39.910
Don't let them get in your head, Mags.

23:40.370 --> 23:42.137
How did you manage this?

23:42.340 --> 23:44.716
Stupidity, mostly.

23:44.741 --> 23:47.093
Casualties from my
last night of freedom.

23:47.118 --> 23:49.463
Getting married, or going to jail?

23:49.488 --> 23:51.221
- Work, actually.
- Mm.

23:51.246 --> 23:53.369
I fly back to the tar sands tonight

23:53.394 --> 23:55.378
- for a three-month stint.
- Hmm.

23:55.403 --> 23:56.870
And this is how you celebrate?

23:56.895 --> 23:59.501
Let's just say, when you launch
yourself off the back of the truck

23:59.526 --> 24:02.011
to catch a football, best
to watch for the tailgate.

24:02.036 --> 24:04.735
Let me guess, there was a
little bit of alcohol involved?

24:04.816 --> 24:07.438
Tell me this isn't gonna
make me miss my flight.

24:07.463 --> 24:10.160
If I don't go tonight,
I'll miss the whole week.

24:10.215 --> 24:12.016
Hold this for me.

24:14.833 --> 24:17.504
Well, you'll need stitches,
and a tetanus shot.

24:17.529 --> 24:19.029
Do you have any other pain?

24:19.054 --> 24:20.627
Just the hangover.

24:20.652 --> 24:21.919
Any neck pain?

24:22.191 --> 24:23.525
No.

24:23.550 --> 24:25.684
So, three months,

24:25.709 --> 24:27.059
That's a pretty long stint.

24:27.116 --> 24:28.801
You like working in bursts like that?

24:28.861 --> 24:30.795
Easier to focus if it's all in.

24:30.897 --> 24:33.441
Then when I'm off, I can actually relax.

24:33.466 --> 24:35.418
Hmm. And you can do that?

24:35.608 --> 24:37.262
Just shut off and relax?

24:37.287 --> 24:38.454
Yeah it's like,

24:38.658 --> 24:40.277
as soon as I get off the plane,

24:40.345 --> 24:44.400
see my friends, my dog, and
it's like a switch flips.

24:45.732 --> 24:47.700
Move your jaw for me.

24:49.166 --> 24:51.590
Alright. I'll get you started on an IV.

24:51.615 --> 24:53.015
Is that necessary?

24:53.040 --> 24:55.412
If you don't want to feel like
crap when you're flying, yes.

24:55.500 --> 24:56.868
I'll come back in a few minutes

24:56.893 --> 24:59.220
to suture that gash, and then
we'll get you out of here.

24:59.297 --> 25:00.764
Thanks, doc.

25:04.415 --> 25:05.774
What happened?

25:05.799 --> 25:08.649
She threw up again, then her eyes
started rolling back in her head!

25:08.674 --> 25:11.261
- Heart rate's 210.
- Another seizure?

25:13.191 --> 25:15.265
2.5 megs of adenosine.

25:15.671 --> 25:19.020
Prepare to cardiovert.
25 Joules, synchronized.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.329
It isn't working. Okay, charging.

25:33.354 --> 25:35.962
<i>- Shock advised.</i>
- Everybody clear?

25:37.334 --> 25:38.935
Shocking.

25:42.174 --> 25:44.128
Come on baby, wake up.

25:44.430 --> 25:47.719
Why isn't she moving?
What else can you do?

25:47.899 --> 25:50.126
Okay. Raising to 50, shocking again.

25:50.151 --> 25:52.052
Charging. Everybody clear!

25:52.077 --> 25:54.887
<i>- Shock advised.
- Shocking.</i>

26:01.669 --> 26:03.814
Oh, thank God.

26:04.401 --> 26:05.749
Hi, Eva.

26:05.774 --> 26:07.484
Do you know where you are?

26:07.843 --> 26:09.277
I threw up.

26:09.302 --> 26:12.131
If there's one place you're allowed
to throw up, that's the hospital.

26:12.598 --> 26:15.334
- What happened to her?
- She's gonna be fine.

26:15.359 --> 26:16.693
We're gonna need to run more tests

26:16.718 --> 26:19.537
but it looks like Eva had an episode
of supraventricular tachycardia.

26:19.562 --> 26:21.967
It's when the heart suddenly
starts beating too fast.

26:21.992 --> 26:23.654
Is that part of her epilepsy?

26:23.679 --> 26:25.312
It is a common side effect,

26:25.337 --> 26:28.011
and likely explains the
symptoms from this morning.

26:28.036 --> 26:29.413
Could this be a one-time thing?

26:29.438 --> 26:32.807
Unfortunately, SVT isn't
normally isolated.

26:33.012 --> 26:35.639
So you should be prepared for
this to happen from time to time.

26:35.664 --> 26:37.905
Does that mean she now has
to deal with seizures,

26:37.930 --> 26:39.490
and a heart problem?

26:39.515 --> 26:42.617
Do we have to bring her back
here every time it happens?

26:42.642 --> 26:45.126
No. There are interventions to
help with episodes at home.

26:46.067 --> 26:48.936
Hey. We're gonna get through this.

26:49.131 --> 26:52.279
We're only given as much
as we can handle, right?

26:52.470 --> 26:53.842
Yeah.

26:54.109 --> 26:55.626
What interventions?

26:55.651 --> 26:58.409
Someone needs to teach us what to do.

26:58.875 --> 27:01.201
Mama, I'm thirsty.

27:09.516 --> 27:12.248
You wanted to see me, sir?

27:12.273 --> 27:14.508
Yeah. Our pregnant patient...

27:14.533 --> 27:15.633
Mm-hmm.

27:15.658 --> 27:18.159
Radiology sent her
results directly to me.

27:20.277 --> 27:22.977
The debridement didn't stop
the bacteria from spreading.

27:23.002 --> 27:25.079
There's infected tissue
deeper in the shoulder.

27:25.104 --> 27:27.070
Which means amputation
is no longer an option.

27:27.095 --> 27:29.797
We need to get her back in for
another debridement immediately

27:29.822 --> 27:31.516
or she'll go into septic shock.

27:32.180 --> 27:34.477
They knew the risks.

27:34.975 --> 27:38.016
All we can do now is deal
with what's in front of us.

27:38.837 --> 27:41.711
Sir, the baby might not
withstand a second debridement.

27:41.736 --> 27:44.227
And if the infection spreads
to the uterus and fetus,

27:44.252 --> 27:47.125
then miscarriage and stillbirth
are very real possibilities.

27:47.150 --> 27:48.376
We need to move fast,

27:48.401 --> 27:51.508
and we're out of conservative
options, which leaves us with...

27:51.533 --> 27:53.055
A C-section. Get the baby out safely,

27:53.080 --> 27:54.813
and then right into another debridement.

27:54.838 --> 27:57.073
- She's 31 weeks?
- Yes. Viable.

27:57.098 --> 27:58.469
Maybe not for the mother.

27:58.676 --> 28:01.680
Delaying debridement for a
caesarean poses a major risk.

28:01.705 --> 28:05.208
Her inflammatory response could
trigger multiple organ failure.

28:05.233 --> 28:07.000
If we don't deliver, the
baby won't make it.

28:07.025 --> 28:09.439
Save the baby or save the mother.

28:11.062 --> 28:13.693
Save both. But they need
to pick who goes first.

28:13.760 --> 28:16.345
- I'll call OB.
- No, we can't send her upstairs.

28:16.370 --> 28:18.413
It's protocol not to let
an infection like nec fasc

28:18.438 --> 28:19.711
anywhere near that ward.

28:19.736 --> 28:21.284
I'll arrange for an OR.

28:23.087 --> 28:25.974
Sir, I've debrided
necrotic tissue before

28:25.999 --> 28:27.579
We'll let the surgeons handle it.

28:27.604 --> 28:30.204
- I was a trauma surgeon.
- I'm aware of that Dr. Hamed,

28:30.229 --> 28:31.337
but you are not one now.

28:31.362 --> 28:33.054
You're an emergency resident here.

28:33.079 --> 28:35.290
These parents have sacrificed
so much for their baby.

28:35.315 --> 28:37.166
I need to make sure they're
around to raise it.

28:37.203 --> 28:38.806
That's what you've been doing all day.

28:38.960 --> 28:40.819
Stay with the husband
during the procedure.

28:40.844 --> 28:43.080
He'll need someone to walk him
through what's happening.

28:43.105 --> 28:45.347
If they thought they had a
tough choice earlier...

28:47.654 --> 28:48.788
No.

28:48.813 --> 28:50.768
- Javier...
- No. He's asking us

28:50.793 --> 28:53.659
to choose between your life and
the baby's. We can't do that.

28:53.684 --> 28:56.021
- I can't do that.
- Not choose, Javier.

28:56.046 --> 28:57.696
Just prioritize.

28:58.694 --> 29:00.313
Save the baby.

29:02.021 --> 29:03.721
Maria, but wait

29:04.126 --> 29:05.453
Listen...

29:05.478 --> 29:06.845
Save the baby.

29:06.870 --> 29:09.784
Maria. Let's talk about this. Okay?

29:09.809 --> 29:13.545
I can't lose this baby, Javier.

29:13.967 --> 29:15.546
I won't.

29:15.928 --> 29:17.728
You know what this means to me.

29:17.753 --> 29:19.843
Okay Maria, but you could die.

29:21.076 --> 29:23.513
I love this baby.

29:24.596 --> 29:28.143
It's already a part of me,
and I need to protect it.

29:31.885 --> 29:33.612
I need you to be strong,

29:33.637 --> 29:36.112
and there for our baby either way.

29:36.784 --> 29:39.153
And I need to hear you say it.

29:39.322 --> 29:41.780
I need you to promise me.

29:42.172 --> 29:43.532
Of course.

29:43.875 --> 29:45.451
Of course I will.

29:45.976 --> 29:47.787
I promise.

29:50.090 --> 29:52.000
I love you.

29:57.994 --> 30:00.229
Do the C-section, Dr. Hamed.

30:00.415 --> 30:01.882
We'll get ready.

30:02.295 --> 30:05.055
One more thing before I go?

30:06.698 --> 30:10.362
Am I having a girl,
or am I having a boy?

30:11.343 --> 30:13.731
You'll see for yourself
when you wake up.

30:23.245 --> 30:25.745
Has cardiology been by to see you yet?

30:25.963 --> 30:28.649
They taught me about vagal
maneuvers she can do

30:28.674 --> 30:29.805
to slow her heart down,

30:29.830 --> 30:32.112
and when to know if she
needs to be brought in.

30:32.137 --> 30:33.904
It might not be forever.

30:34.247 --> 30:37.016
Some kids do outgrow their seizures.

30:37.294 --> 30:39.221
If you're asking me to
wait for a miracle,

30:39.246 --> 30:41.385
that's Luke's department.

30:41.538 --> 30:43.080
He's in the chapel now.

30:43.261 --> 30:46.428
Oh. I can sit with her if
you'd like to go join him.

30:46.800 --> 30:48.722
I pray too, Dr. Hunter.

30:48.912 --> 30:51.266
But I do it with my eyes wide open.

30:52.171 --> 30:54.948
And I only ask for the courage
to be strong enough for Eva,

30:54.973 --> 30:57.106
to give my daughter what she needs.

30:58.266 --> 31:00.133
She's lucky to have you.

31:00.593 --> 31:02.570
And I'm lucky to have her.

31:06.397 --> 31:08.690
Promise me you'll keep this clean,

31:08.869 --> 31:11.121
and you'll get a doctor
to get the clips out.

31:11.558 --> 31:13.122
You're a lifesaver.

31:17.642 --> 31:19.862
- You feeling okay?
- Yeah.

31:19.887 --> 31:21.995
Just dry mouth.

31:22.020 --> 31:24.133
I'll grab some water on my way out.

31:25.719 --> 31:27.853
I think we should take your temperature.

31:28.647 --> 31:30.800
I swear doc, I'm fine.

31:30.825 --> 31:33.104
Still probably, you know maybe
just a little hungover.

31:38.844 --> 31:40.829
- Okay. Okay.
- What?!

31:40.854 --> 31:43.354
Take this. Sit down. Sit back down.

31:43.379 --> 31:45.655
What, uh... What's happening?

31:46.719 --> 31:49.950
Alright. Take this off. Lie down.

31:55.715 --> 31:57.583
It's gonna be cold.

32:02.780 --> 32:04.339
Pleural effusion.

32:04.805 --> 32:06.550
You've got water on your lungs.

32:06.767 --> 32:08.802
What? Why?

32:09.005 --> 32:11.234
My guess would be pulmonary embolism.

32:11.259 --> 32:12.868
When you injured your leg,

32:12.893 --> 32:15.312
a blood clot formed and
travelled to your lungs.

32:15.337 --> 32:17.805
You're gonna need to start
anti-coagulants immediately.

32:17.830 --> 32:19.143
I'm... I'm gonna be okay?

32:19.168 --> 32:20.788
Well, we caught it early, which is good,

32:20.813 --> 32:22.883
but you're definitely not
gonna make that flight.

32:22.908 --> 32:24.609
I'll be right back.

32:25.634 --> 32:26.953
What?

32:26.978 --> 32:29.492
Our obstetrician will deliver the baby

32:29.517 --> 32:31.539
with the help of our general surgeon.

32:31.843 --> 32:34.161
There's a team from NICU on standby.

32:34.186 --> 32:37.101
Once they get the baby
out, the general surgeon

32:37.126 --> 32:39.959
will debride the remaining
infected tissue.

32:39.984 --> 32:42.420
Let's get moving. We're
already on borrowed time.

32:42.445 --> 32:44.346
Making the first incision.

32:47.498 --> 32:48.966
And into the fascia.

32:52.028 --> 32:54.351
Scissors. Thank you.

32:55.954 --> 32:57.727
Suction.

33:01.446 --> 33:03.650
One, two, three, stretch.

33:04.092 --> 33:05.902
Lower end.

33:14.222 --> 33:16.787
Lower end out, retract her out.

33:17.058 --> 33:20.041
I've got the baby's head.
Give me pressure.

33:22.185 --> 33:26.094
Give me pressure! Again!

33:29.573 --> 33:33.388
Baby's flat, let's be quick.

33:33.413 --> 33:36.099
Looks like a uterine
artery has been clipped.

33:36.124 --> 33:37.547
I'm on it.

33:37.572 --> 33:40.061
Nice work, doctor. Stay close.

33:40.086 --> 33:43.230
There's not much time.
Come on, let's go.

33:43.255 --> 33:44.857
I'll start bagging.

33:45.899 --> 33:47.652
Get the monitors up.

33:50.812 --> 33:53.241
Chest is moving. Turn the O2 to 100.

33:53.266 --> 33:56.372
What? Wait, what's wrong?
What's happening?

33:56.397 --> 34:00.016
The baby's premature. There
are added steps to be taken.

34:00.041 --> 34:03.156
The heart rate's 47.
Prepare to intubate.

34:03.181 --> 34:04.999
What, the baby's not breathing?

34:05.024 --> 34:06.629
The heart rate's too low.

34:06.654 --> 34:08.755
They're working to bring it up.

34:16.583 --> 34:19.058
Starting compressions.

34:26.556 --> 34:30.376
Oh, my God.

34:33.088 --> 34:35.614
Pause compressions.

34:39.340 --> 34:41.574
We're good. Let's get the baby to NICU.

34:41.600 --> 34:43.540
Heart rate's stable.

34:47.971 --> 34:49.630
What the...

34:50.098 --> 34:52.174
What about the alarms?

34:52.199 --> 34:54.426
What's he looking at?

34:55.837 --> 34:57.679
What's happening to Maria?

34:57.704 --> 35:01.244
She, um... She's in respiratory
distress and septic shock.

35:01.269 --> 35:02.727
But Javier, I promise you,

35:02.752 --> 35:04.653
our surgeons will do whatever they can.

35:06.497 --> 35:07.831
Go to NICU.

35:07.856 --> 35:09.772
Your baby's not out of the woods yet.

35:09.797 --> 35:11.672
There could be choices to be made.

35:11.697 --> 35:12.711
What about Maria?

35:12.736 --> 35:14.647
There's nothing you can
do for Maria right now.

35:14.672 --> 35:17.593
I know you want to be in two
places at once, but you can't.

35:17.618 --> 35:18.929
I'll stay with Maria.

35:18.954 --> 35:21.621
And as soon as there's news of
any kind, I'll come get you.

35:21.777 --> 35:23.746
Go see your baby, Javier.

35:39.311 --> 35:42.077
I heard you caught a pulmonary embolism.

35:42.123 --> 35:44.324
- I noti...
- Nice work.

35:44.952 --> 35:48.721
I noticed him coughing, and I should've
investigated it sooner, but...

35:49.609 --> 35:52.491
All I could hear was
your voice in my head.

35:53.528 --> 35:54.862
Telling you what?

35:54.997 --> 35:58.566
That I'm... That I'm focusing
on all the wrong things.

35:59.365 --> 36:02.036
That's your voice, Mags. Not mine.

36:03.957 --> 36:05.623
This job...

36:06.125 --> 36:08.360
is all I've ever wanted.

36:09.375 --> 36:12.003
Then find the way to be the doctor

36:12.028 --> 36:13.729
I need you to be.

36:16.161 --> 36:17.997
Good night, Dr. Leblanc.

36:40.306 --> 36:41.706
Maria?

36:41.731 --> 36:43.160
She's going to be okay.

36:51.829 --> 36:53.628
It's a beautiful baby.

37:09.198 --> 37:10.855
Dr. Curtis.

37:12.958 --> 37:15.359
Have you ever...

37:16.657 --> 37:19.029
wanted to just burn it all down?

37:19.877 --> 37:21.781
Instead of sucking it up?

37:24.130 --> 37:25.912
All the time.

37:27.615 --> 37:29.998
Have you? Ever?

37:30.386 --> 37:32.250
Once or twice.

37:33.115 --> 37:34.716
Was it worth it?

37:35.248 --> 37:37.798
The only one who got burned was me.

37:39.398 --> 37:40.832
Well, I...

37:40.886 --> 37:43.345
I mean, anytime you
have a patient for me,

37:43.370 --> 37:45.598
I'm interested. So...

37:46.889 --> 37:48.518
I'll keep that in mind.

38:01.332 --> 38:03.324
It looks like we stopped the infection.

38:03.349 --> 38:05.387
Your latest MRI was clear.

38:08.871 --> 38:10.772
You are so brave.

38:13.208 --> 38:14.867
You're so strong.

38:14.892 --> 38:16.292
The baby?

38:16.712 --> 38:19.090
Baby? I took a video...

38:19.580 --> 38:22.927
- of our little girl.
- A little girl?

38:28.764 --> 38:31.018
She looks just like her papa.

38:32.339 --> 38:34.689
She's four pounds, three ounces,

38:34.900 --> 38:36.899
but she's a fighter, like her mom.

39:17.257 --> 39:19.149
I was looking for you.

39:21.126 --> 39:22.676
Listen, I...

39:22.807 --> 39:26.114
may have been a little
short with you today.

39:28.535 --> 39:32.078
Not punching back, Theo, that's
nothing to be ashamed of.

39:32.705 --> 39:34.749
I've never punched back.

39:36.185 --> 39:39.295
Not in any part of my life.

39:42.766 --> 39:44.759
Amira went home today.

39:45.261 --> 39:46.934
Our old apartment,

39:47.125 --> 39:49.722
without even knowing
where she was going.

39:52.984 --> 39:55.978
You know, she's been through
so much, and, uh...

40:01.254 --> 40:03.235
I don't know what I'm doing.

40:06.034 --> 40:07.781
None of us do.

40:18.262 --> 40:20.960
Long road ahead for that family.

40:21.859 --> 40:24.118
And all so that, in 18 years time,

40:24.143 --> 40:25.960
the kid can resent them,
and they can wonder

40:25.985 --> 40:28.259
if everything they went
through today was worth it.

40:30.073 --> 40:31.606
Jed.

40:31.631 --> 40:33.140
Is that really how you feel?

40:37.046 --> 40:38.645
No.

40:47.477 --> 40:50.365
What happened to getting
me something small?

40:50.578 --> 40:53.244
I changed my mind. We both deserve it.

41:07.385 --> 41:10.928
Did you know that you were
born with a full head of hair?

41:11.806 --> 41:14.931
And you worried just like that
when you were little, too.

41:19.143 --> 41:21.911
I'm sorry I lost my
temper with you today.

41:22.035 --> 41:24.317
I'm so proud of how you're handling

41:24.797 --> 41:27.570
everything that we're going through.

41:30.176 --> 41:32.110
Mama used to get mad at me

41:32.135 --> 41:33.908
for playing with my hair.

41:33.933 --> 41:37.079
Said it would all fall
out and I would go bald.

41:37.657 --> 41:40.748
She started braiding it so I would stop

41:41.559 --> 41:43.400
I could braid for you, too?

41:45.462 --> 41:49.883
Mama said braids were way
harder than stitches.

41:50.665 --> 41:53.867
I keep dreaming about her.

41:54.131 --> 41:57.141
- Are they good dreams?
- Most of them.

41:59.729 --> 42:02.814
Why don't you like it when I
talk about Mama and Baba?

42:02.839 --> 42:05.064
Is that what you think? No.

42:05.605 --> 42:06.984
No.

42:08.178 --> 42:09.979
Yella. Time for class.

42:10.004 --> 42:13.658
- You'll wait?
- I'm not going anywhere.
