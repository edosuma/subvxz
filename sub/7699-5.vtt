WEBVTT

01:32.133 --> 01:33.426
That's good enough, Alfred.

01:33.634 --> 01:36.470
The people I deal with out there
won't mind a little lint.

01:37.930 --> 01:40.558
Ajob worth doing and all that rot,
Master Bruce.

01:43.311 --> 01:45.021
I do wish you would put on a shirt.

01:45.104 --> 01:47.273
You're apt to catch cold
in this dank cave.

01:53.738 --> 01:57.783
Yes, folks, a perfect 10
for Dick Grayson to take the gold.

01:57.950 --> 01:59.994
And the crowd goes wild.

02:01.495 --> 02:02.663
Yeah!

02:02.747 --> 02:04.665
- Did you hear me, Master Dick?
- Yeah, all right!

02:05.916 --> 02:08.586
Yes, Alfred. Right away, Alfred.

02:17.386 --> 02:20.014
I've fixed your supper.
It's upstairs, in the oven.

02:20.389 --> 02:23.517
- What would we do without you, Alfred?
- I shudder to think.

02:33.152 --> 02:35.404
- Good evening. Wayne Manor.
<i>- Alfie?</i>

02:35.905 --> 02:38.407
- It's your cousin Freddie.
- Frederick?

02:38.866 --> 02:42.036
<i>I say, old thing, could you
meet me at the usual place?</i>

02:42.286 --> 02:43.829
<i>It's rather urgent.</i>

02:44.121 --> 02:46.666
Yes, of course. I'll leave immediately.

02:46.999 --> 02:48.459
Now what?

03:04.892 --> 03:06.936
Hey, was a butlers' strike called?

03:07.228 --> 03:09.855
I came down for breakfast,
and all I found was this.

03:10.189 --> 03:11.399
Where's Alfred?

03:13.234 --> 03:16.153
"Dear Master Bruce, my apologies for
leaving so abruptly.

03:16.237 --> 03:19.240
"I've just learned of a personal matter
involving a cousin of mine

03:19.323 --> 03:21.117
"that must be resolved immediately.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.828
"I shall endeavor to return
in a few days.

03:23.994 --> 03:25.621
"Your obedient servant, Alfred."

03:25.996 --> 03:27.331
Must be pretty important.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.667
Alfred wouldn't leave
a dirty dish unwashed

03:29.750 --> 03:31.419
if England were sinking into the sea.

03:31.836 --> 03:33.045
I know.

03:49.270 --> 03:52.523
- Frederick?
- Hello. Is that Alfie?

03:52.606 --> 03:55.359
- Mr. Pennyworth will do.
- Right then.

03:55.860 --> 03:59.113
It's Freddie sent us.
Wants you to come with us.

03:59.613 --> 04:02.950
- Frederick sent you?
- That's right, old love. Come along now.

04:03.117 --> 04:05.578
- We'II pop around and see him.
- I think not.

04:06.120 --> 04:09.790
Frederick knows I hate being called
Alfie as much as he hates Freddie.

04:10.541 --> 04:13.127
- What have you done with him?
- Grab him, Bert.

04:31.729 --> 04:33.022
Hello?

04:33.606 --> 04:36.859
Good evening, Master Bruce. I'm so sorry
to have disturbed your rest.

04:37.026 --> 04:39.862
Alfred. Are you all right?
Where are you?

04:40.237 --> 04:43.115
I'm at the Yorkshire Arms
just at the moment. In London.

04:43.199 --> 04:46.368
- London, England?
- There's only one, Master Bruce.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.163
I seem to be
in a bit of a sticky situation,

04:49.330 --> 04:50.915
and I was wondering if you-

04:53.209 --> 04:55.836
Come along easy, gramps.
We don't want to hurt you.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.172
I'm afraid I'll have
to ring off now, sir.

04:58.255 --> 05:00.591
It seems I have unexpected guests.

05:00.674 --> 05:01.967
Alfred, are you there?

05:02.426 --> 05:04.178
<i>- Alfred? Alfred!</i>

05:11.560 --> 05:14.647
Before he came to the States,
Alfred did some work as an attache'

05:14.814 --> 05:16.273
in the British Security Services.

05:16.440 --> 05:19.985
More desk jobs than fieldwork,
but he acquired quite a reputation

05:20.152 --> 05:24.365
for defusing diplomatically dangerous
situations in high-security areas.

05:24.532 --> 05:26.408
And I thought he was just a nice old guy

05:26.617 --> 05:28.327
who polished the silver
and fixed me sandwiches.

05:29.119 --> 05:30.996
He's fixed more than that in his time.

05:32.248 --> 05:34.625
Underneath Alfred's very proper exterior

05:34.708 --> 05:36.961
is a highly resourceful
government agent.

05:37.753 --> 05:39.213
He mentioned his cousin.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.674
As far as I know,
he has no living relatives.

05:42.258 --> 05:46.011
And cousin can sometimes mean a fellow
member of an intelligence organization.

05:46.804 --> 05:48.764
Well, I hear England's nice
this time of year.

06:23.924 --> 06:25.175
End of the line, mate.

06:26.468 --> 06:28.095
It's good to see you again, old man.

06:28.345 --> 06:30.306
I'm sorry it has to be under
such circumstances.

06:30.681 --> 06:33.142
Exactly what circumstances
are we talking about?

06:33.726 --> 06:35.769
My heavens! Red Claw.

06:36.145 --> 06:39.273
So pleased to make your acquaintance,
Mr. Pennyworth.

06:39.398 --> 06:43.485
If you do exactly as I say,
you might live to see tomorrow.

06:54.455 --> 06:57.207
Bruce, over here.
Looks like he put up a struggle.

06:58.125 --> 06:59.710
Poor Alfred.
He must have been petrified.

07:00.294 --> 07:01.295
I doubt it.

07:01.545 --> 07:03.422
He was pretty formidable in his day.

07:03.964 --> 07:05.215
Come on.

07:10.387 --> 07:12.806
Two blokes just came out
of Pennyworth's room.

07:14.725 --> 07:15.768
Right.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.065
Where they off to, then?

07:22.399 --> 07:24.026
I don't know about this, Ernie.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.530
- Where'd they go?
- We're chasing a pair of poxy ghosts.

07:32.034 --> 07:33.327
Stone the crows!

08:01.105 --> 08:02.690
Gotcha.

08:03.273 --> 08:05.567
May I see your license?

08:28.007 --> 08:30.426
When they wake up,
they'll tell us who they're working for.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.471
I don't think
we'll have to wait that long.

08:35.222 --> 08:36.473
Red Claw.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.728
<i>I've wasted enough courtesy
on you two.</i>

08:41.270 --> 08:43.480
Courtesy? None that I've seen.

08:44.898 --> 08:47.192
I want this missile silo operational.

08:47.651 --> 08:51.196
I intend for the British government
to give me £5 billion

08:51.405 --> 08:54.116
to keep me from wiping London
off the map.

08:54.616 --> 08:57.286
You understand, old man,
I had no choice in the matter.

08:57.661 --> 08:59.288
But of course, dear boy.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.624
Each of you holds half the firing code
for this missile.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.794
I want that code. Or else.

09:06.170 --> 09:07.838
Madam, impossible.

09:08.088 --> 09:11.300
We are both signatories
to the Official Secrets Act.

09:11.383 --> 09:13.719
I've already thought of that.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.732
Still no word from Castle Blairquhan.

09:26.940 --> 09:29.068
Our post there has never missed
a check-in.

09:29.401 --> 09:32.738
Here's more bad news.
Agent Frederick has been listed missing.

09:33.405 --> 09:34.531
I don't like this.

09:34.698 --> 09:37.618
Frederick was part of the original
security team at Blairquhan.

09:37.993 --> 09:42.164
- Him and that fellow from Clerical.
- Pennyworth, Alfred Pennyworth.

09:42.414 --> 09:44.124
Our apologies for intruding.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.876
You were saying something
about a castle?

09:46.085 --> 09:47.711
How did you get in here?

09:48.253 --> 09:51.465
We don't have time for protocol.
Pennyworth is also missing.

09:52.049 --> 09:55.135
We have reason to think he and Frederick
might be in considerable danger.

09:55.677 --> 09:57.179
What was the name of that castle?

09:57.262 --> 09:59.765
And why should we give you
that information?

10:00.182 --> 10:02.559
Because I can give you Red Claw.

10:07.731 --> 10:11.693
Blairquhan. Castle Blairquhan
on the west Scottish coast.

10:12.194 --> 10:14.404
It was the base for Project Excalibur.

10:14.738 --> 10:17.407
Blairquhan is the last
of our land-based missile silos.

10:18.033 --> 10:20.494
Do you think that's what
Red Claw is after?

10:21.620 --> 10:22.788
Apparently so.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.083
Truth serum?

10:26.500 --> 10:30.129
Of course. The old methods
are still often the best.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.172
Fight it if you like.

10:32.256 --> 10:34.383
You won't hold out for long.

10:34.466 --> 10:36.468
But it might be amusing.

10:37.719 --> 10:39.721
Well, anything to amuse a lady.

10:39.888 --> 10:43.267
If lady is the word I want,
which I doubt.

10:43.725 --> 10:45.853
Aw, sticks and stones.

11:04.079 --> 11:06.957
Won't... I... I won't.

11:07.374 --> 11:11.253
Give me your access code
for the missile activator.

11:11.545 --> 11:12.546
Never.

11:13.005 --> 11:15.465
You'll get nothing but gibberish
out of me, madam.

11:15.799 --> 11:19.678
I come from haunts of coat and fern.
I make a sudden sally.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.599
And bicker down the valley.

11:24.141 --> 11:27.811
And people wonder why no one takes
Britain seriously anymore.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.647
The code, old man. Now.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.983
Fourteen...

11:33.817 --> 11:39.990
14 Gurrier's Crescent, Blairquhan Upper.

11:43.243 --> 11:48.290
Absurdly simple like most passwords.
Now, as for you.

11:48.790 --> 11:52.920
"Half a league, half a league,
half a league onward..."

11:53.462 --> 11:57.049
Desperate valor to the last.
Not that it will help you.

11:57.966 --> 12:01.220
Sooner or later, the serum always wins.

12:37.881 --> 12:39.341
Looks clear.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.577
Impossible! How could he
have learned about this?

14:17.105 --> 14:20.484
- That's one less thing to worry about.
- Two less things.

14:20.859 --> 14:24.196
- Dennis, you're always the humorist.
- Did you hear that?

14:41.713 --> 14:46.218
<i>Londoners. Your ancient city may pride
itself on having survived</i>

14:46.468 --> 14:48.970
<i>plagues, fires, even the Blitz.</i>

14:49.513 --> 14:54.267
<i>But unless £5 billion are delivered
to me by midnight tonight,</i>

14:54.518 --> 14:56.812
<i>there will be nothing left to survive.</i>

14:57.104 --> 15:00.899
<i>We have Blairquhan Castle
and its missile installation</i>

15:01.316 --> 15:03.985
<i>and the codes to operate the missile.</i>

15:04.653 --> 15:06.947
<i>You have one hour.</i>

15:07.239 --> 15:09.658
<i>Otherwise, I'll be forced
to plant this warhead</i>

15:09.741 --> 15:11.868
<i>in the middle of Trafalgar Square.</i>

15:12.661 --> 15:15.288
<i>And if! do that, well...</i>

15:15.872 --> 15:18.291
<i>God save the queen.</i>

15:20.043 --> 15:23.713
Is it smart to make demands before
we get the other half of the go code?

15:23.922 --> 15:26.216
I will have the code
in a matter of minutes.

15:43.525 --> 15:46.486
Give me the code, or I'll-

15:46.653 --> 15:51.491
The lion and the unicorn
fighting for the crown.

15:53.160 --> 15:56.872
He can't be resisting the drug
this long. It's impossible.

15:57.747 --> 16:00.750
- The lion and the unicorn fighting...
- Wait. He's not resisting.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.961
This doggerel is the code.

16:04.421 --> 16:07.174
"The lion and the unicorn".

16:12.345 --> 16:13.555
At last!

16:51.676 --> 16:53.094
You three, come with me.

16:53.929 --> 16:55.138
Watch them.

16:57.891 --> 17:00.685
Fan out. This is the only access
to the control room.

17:00.769 --> 17:03.021
They'll have to come through here.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.154
Take them.

17:39.599 --> 17:41.643
And here I thought all you dusted
was furniture.

17:42.102 --> 17:44.854
A Louis Quinze. What a pity.

17:50.151 --> 17:51.653
Goodness me.

18:35.572 --> 18:38.074
- Dear Lord!
- Do you two have the destruct code?

20:29.936 --> 20:33.231
I don't suppose you'd consider
coming out of retirement?

20:33.314 --> 20:36.025
And taking up civil service
pay grades again?

20:36.109 --> 20:39.946
Hardly, old man. I've become accustomed
to my style of living.

20:40.029 --> 20:43.408
It's a great pity.
It was just like old times.

20:43.867 --> 20:45.452
Give my best to Whitehall.

21:22.405 --> 21:23.406
English - SDH
