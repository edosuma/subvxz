01:16.400 --> 01:19.039
Oh, Al...

01:19.280 --> 01:22.113
...you even brushed your teeth.

01:24.160 --> 01:26.515
Hey, you're not Al.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.676
Yeah, and you're no Mars bar.

01:40.880 --> 01:45.078
A fat woman creatured her way
into the shoe store today.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.999
Let me guess, Al.

01:47.240 --> 01:49.276
She sat down,
and then she couldn't get up?

01:49.520 --> 01:52.353
No, Peg. That would be you.

01:53.480 --> 01:57.553
Oh, honey. l can get up,
but why would l?

01:57.920 --> 02:00.514
To give the cushions a breather.

02:01.280 --> 02:04.352
Anyway, this three-times-a-lady...

02:04.560 --> 02:07.279
...told me that
the Kyoto National Bank...

02:07.520 --> 02:10.353
...was buying a new football
scoreboard for Polk High.

02:10.600 --> 02:15.469
-Oh, much better than a new library.
-That's exactly what l said.

02:16.080 --> 02:17.718
But the best part is, Peg...

02:17.960 --> 02:19.552
...they're dedicating it...

02:19.760 --> 02:22.194
...to the most famous
Polk High football legend.

02:22.440 --> 02:26.194
A hint:
Four touchdowns in one game.

02:27.200 --> 02:29.998
-You?
-Well, it's not official yet...

02:30.240 --> 02:34.233
...but who else went to Polk scored
four times in one game besides you?

02:36.280 --> 02:38.271
Al, why do you think you'd win?

02:38.480 --> 02:43.110
l mean, Marcie works at the Kyoto Bank
and she hates you more than l do.

02:43.360 --> 02:47.069
Oh, hold on, now, Peg.
Marcie and l have a lot in common.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.310
Wrong house.

02:51.440 --> 02:55.274
We both live on the same side
of the street. Both married deadbeats.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.995
l eat chicken. She is one.

03:02.320 --> 03:05.198
Dad, she's had you arrested
over 20 times...

03:05.440 --> 03:07.908
...and you call her
''the little neighbour boy.''

03:08.680 --> 03:11.592
Pet name. Listen, Bud.

03:11.840 --> 03:14.832
l want you to go over there
and pick up that unsightly trash...

03:15.040 --> 03:16.632
...that's accumulating on her yard.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.236
Dad, you threw it there.

03:20.520 --> 03:22.875
You wanna talk to me
a little bit outside?

03:23.120 --> 03:24.553
Fine.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.436
Just do it.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.553
Didn't l tell you to--

03:33.800 --> 03:37.839
That you are the most attractive,
vibrant woman l have ever seen.

03:38.640 --> 03:40.312
Wrong house.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.029
He thinks you're here
about the scoreboard.

03:43.280 --> 03:46.955
-Well, as a matter of fact, l am.
-l told you, Peg.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.472
The nominating committee...

03:49.680 --> 03:52.990
...wants to dedicate the new
Polk High football scoreboard...

03:53.200 --> 03:55.031
...to you, Al.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.315
What a surprise.

03:59.920 --> 04:03.799
Well, before you brush off
your good underwear...

04:04.800 --> 04:07.951
...there is still one obstacle
that lies between you...

04:08.200 --> 04:10.350
...and the eternal happiness
you seek.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.353
You heard her, Peg. Get out.

04:14.440 --> 04:16.192
Not her, Al.

04:16.440 --> 04:17.839
Me.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.954
You know, Marcie,
l used to call you a chicken...

04:21.200 --> 04:22.474
...but in this light...

04:22.680 --> 04:26.116
...you look more like
the stately peacock.

04:27.640 --> 04:28.959
Save it.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.794
l told that committee
that there had to be...

04:32.040 --> 04:34.634
...a better football player
that came out of Polk.

04:34.880 --> 04:37.440
So they've given me 24 hours
to find one.

04:37.680 --> 04:40.797
They can give you 24 lifetimes,
and a new set of tail feathers.

04:41.040 --> 04:43.270
You'll never be able to find
a better one.

04:47.320 --> 04:48.548
Maybe so.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.553
But l will not rest
until someone else's name...

04:51.760 --> 04:53.990
...is on that scoreboard.

04:57.280 --> 04:59.157
l finished cleaning up
the D'Arcys' yard.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.278
-Where you want me to put this?
-Put it back where you found it.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.231
Before you throw it over the fence,
light it on fire.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.710
Here, Mr. D'Arcy.
Here are all the yearbooks...

05:19.920 --> 05:22.036
...from my senior years
in high school.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.956
Well, thanks, Kelly. So far we found
only one football player...

05:28.160 --> 05:31.072
...in Polk High history who can hold
a candle to your father.

05:31.320 --> 05:32.799
He's trying to reach him now.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.679
Yeah, is Scooter MacPhee there?

05:36.280 --> 05:38.840
He is not? He's where?

05:39.080 --> 05:41.640
Leavenworth? That's great.

05:42.320 --> 05:44.914
l mean, it's great that he's off
the streets. Bye-bye.

05:45.960 --> 05:48.076
Jefferson, he killed
a whole mess of people.

05:48.320 --> 05:50.595
He won't be out for months.

05:51.440 --> 05:53.874
That scoreboard is mine.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.397
Congratulations.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.278
Oh, Daddy, this is so great.

05:59.520 --> 06:02.956
lt's kind of like a real father
getting a promotion.

06:03.360 --> 06:04.634
Only better, pumpkin.

06:04.840 --> 06:08.150
Because l may not have a lot of money
or a job l can stand...

06:08.400 --> 06:10.755
...or people l wanna come home to...

06:11.000 --> 06:13.355
...but now l'm going to have
a scoreboard...

06:13.600 --> 06:15.113
...that proudly bears my name.

06:15.360 --> 06:17.555
See, that's my legacy, pumpkin.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.997
And when l'm gone,
and l hope it's soon...

06:21.560 --> 06:24.233
...you can look up and say,
''That fine-looking scoreboard...

06:24.440 --> 06:27.557
-...is dedicated to--''
-Terry Bradshaw.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.631
Terry Brad--

06:30.880 --> 06:32.711
Terry Bradshaw?

06:32.960 --> 06:35.793
l never had no nickname
Terry Bradshaw.

06:37.040 --> 06:40.350
Not you, you chin strap.

06:41.360 --> 06:46.115
l mean Super Bowl champion
and Hall of Fame quarterback...

06:46.360 --> 06:48.032
...Terry Bradshaw.

06:48.280 --> 06:49.759
What are you talking about?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.831
Terry Bradshaw
never went to Polk High.

06:52.080 --> 06:55.390
He did for two months in 1 965.

06:56.120 --> 06:59.032
Just long enough
to join the chess club...

06:59.240 --> 07:02.630
...and play Glinda
in The Wizard of Oz.

07:03.800 --> 07:08.715
That is Bradshaw, right between
that munchkin and Dorothy.

07:08.960 --> 07:09.949
Look at that.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.915
Why are you doing this
to me, Marcie?

07:13.160 --> 07:18.075
Because God's on vacation,
and he asked me to fill in.

07:19.320 --> 07:22.676
Oh, don't worry, Al, we still want
you to come to the ceremony...

07:22.880 --> 07:26.873
...and if you don't mind,
would you wear this T-shirt?

07:27.120 --> 07:29.554
lt would be an inspiration
to all the students.

07:38.960 --> 07:41.315
Daddy, this is an outrage.

07:41.560 --> 07:45.872
This is just like the time
that Odie stole Garfield's lasagne.

07:46.640 --> 07:50.235
Now, he earned that lasagne,
and you earned that scoreboard.

07:50.440 --> 07:51.668
Do you know what?

07:51.880 --> 07:55.031
All he had for dinner
was cold cat food.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.717
l don't want that
to happen to you, Daddy.

07:57.920 --> 08:00.480
l'm gonna go out there
and get that scoreboard for you...

08:00.720 --> 08:03.234
...and nothing is gonna stand
in my way.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.757
We're trapped.

08:14.440 --> 08:15.759
Watch this, Jefferson.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.148
Push, sweetheart.

08:30.440 --> 08:33.636
Thank you, Daddy. Gotta go.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.791
Quiet on the set.

08:46.080 --> 08:47.399
And action.

08:48.920 --> 08:51.992
l'm Terry Bradshaw
for Kyoto National Bank.

08:52.240 --> 08:56.552
Give me a K, give me a Y,
give me an O-T-O.

08:56.800 --> 09:01.078
-And what does it spell?
-l have no idea.

09:01.720 --> 09:03.551
Cut!

09:06.440 --> 09:10.991
lt spells '' Kyoto,''
you home entertainment centre.

09:12.560 --> 09:15.552
l'm sorry, Terry. l'll get another girl
down here who can spell.

09:16.120 --> 09:19.430
-You do, l'm walking.
-Alrighty.

09:20.120 --> 09:22.076
We're on a five.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.709
Terry, l'll get makeup in here
to give you a touchup.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.393
Excuse me for a few minutes.

09:26.640 --> 09:29.359
l've got a lot to do
before tomorrow's dedication...

09:29.600 --> 09:33.878
...and unlike you, l don't have anyone
on the sidelines calling in the plays.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.757
l called my own plays.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.353
That was Staubach.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.558
l beat him in the Super Bowl twice.

09:53.440 --> 09:55.271
Brad Clayshaw?

09:57.920 --> 09:59.911
Terry Bradpitt?

10:01.640 --> 10:03.119
Hey, Mr. Football-Star-Guy.

10:03.320 --> 10:05.231
Hi, l'm Kelly.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.199
-l'm your makeup artist.
-Well, what happened to Christy?

10:08.440 --> 10:11.193
Well, she's a little tied up right now.

10:11.800 --> 10:14.712
-What happened to your arm?
-Oh, l broke my wrist.

10:14.960 --> 10:19.431
No, no, no. The other one,
it's so much smaller and frecklier.

10:22.040 --> 10:26.477
So you must be really honoured having
this entire field named after you, huh?

10:26.720 --> 10:30.030
Well, l am but, l mean,
l'm not sure l deserve it.

10:30.720 --> 10:33.154
l only went to Polk High
for two months.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.631
l mean, l never even put on
a football uniform.

10:37.560 --> 10:39.278
You played naked?

10:40.400 --> 10:42.630
Maybe you do deserve this.

10:42.880 --> 10:45.235
Actually, l didn't play at all.

10:45.480 --> 10:47.391
Oh, that's funny.

10:47.640 --> 10:51.030
Because, see, my father, Al Bundy,
he did play for Polk High.

10:51.280 --> 10:54.238
ln fact, he scored
four touchdowns in one game.

10:54.440 --> 10:55.919
lt was the highlight of his life.

10:57.480 --> 11:00.313
He got married. Had you.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.760
Four touchdowns.

11:04.320 --> 11:05.594
That's impressive.

11:05.840 --> 11:09.628
Yeah, well, apparently not
to the Bank of Coyote.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.912
See, my father gave everything
he had to Polk High...

11:14.160 --> 11:17.835
...and if you look at him now,
you'll know that that's all he had.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.230
Look, Mr. Shawshank...

11:23.520 --> 11:25.476
...you're a big football star. l mean...

11:25.680 --> 11:28.035
...you know what it's like
to win the big one.

11:28.280 --> 11:31.158
My father never even won
the little one.

11:31.400 --> 11:35.473
So will you please just let him
have this one stupid honour?

11:35.720 --> 11:38.792
Stop, please. He can have it.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.838
You mean it?

11:46.080 --> 11:48.514
Absolutely. l mean, don't worry.
l'll take care of it.

11:48.760 --> 11:52.719
Tomorrow at the dedication,
your daddy's gonna know...

11:52.960 --> 11:54.678
...what it's like to win the big one.

12:00.480 --> 12:03.552
Terry freaking Bradshaw.

12:04.480 --> 12:06.311
How come quarterbacks
get all the glory?

12:06.560 --> 12:08.710
He never scored four touchdowns
in one game.

12:09.240 --> 12:13.552
Dad, you just need to watch some TV
and take your mind off Terry Bradshaw.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.552
Oh, maybe you're right.

12:15.800 --> 12:19.429
I'll tak e Terry Bradshaw
for a thousand, Alex.

12:19.680 --> 12:23.798
Tonight on Family Matters,
Urk el finds his long-lost father...

12:24.000 --> 12:26.434
... Terry Bradshaw.

12:26.680 --> 12:31.595
Tonight on PBS, the Three Tenors
and Terry Bradshaw.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.152
Oh, man.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.233
You wouldn't believe
the traffic out there.

12:37.480 --> 12:40.119
Between the ticker-tape parades,
the autograph hounds...

12:40.320 --> 12:42.311
...and the gorgeous babes
swooning for him...

12:42.520 --> 12:44.795
...you'd think the pope was in town.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.789
Let me guess. Terry Bradshaw.

12:48.040 --> 12:50.031
You got it. Look,
he signed my sleeve.

12:50.280 --> 12:52.032
Oh, yeah, he signed it.

12:52.280 --> 12:54.430
Well, l guess Bradshaw
does need some happiness.

12:54.640 --> 12:57.234
He only had those years
with the Steelers, endorsements...

12:57.440 --> 12:59.476
-...the broadcasting career--
-Don't forget...

12:59.680 --> 13:01.159
...those Cannonball Run movies...

13:01.360 --> 13:04.113
-...he made with Mel Tillis.
-He got nominated for those.

13:04.920 --> 13:08.833
Jefferson, the man won more
Super Bowls than l've had good days.

13:10.320 --> 13:15.553
Now Marcie and her Hideo Nomo-loving
cronies down at the bank--

13:17.880 --> 13:21.031
They wanna give him what's
rightfully mine. l can takes no more.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.472
When a Bundy doesn't get
what is his...

13:24.680 --> 13:26.636
...he makes sure
no one else gets it either.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.996
l know now what we must do.

13:52.200 --> 13:55.476
Kelly, this is where your father
used to do all his scoring.

13:55.720 --> 13:59.030
Back in the prehistoric days
when we were dating.

13:59.280 --> 14:03.034
When dinosaurs roamed the land
and not my bedroom.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.470
Daddy, l am so glad
you decided to come.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.518
l have a feeling you're gonna
get a big surprise later.

14:09.760 --> 14:12.194
Oh, l'm sure someone will.

14:12.440 --> 14:15.079
Hey, where's Bud?
He said he was gonna be here.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.993
Oh, he's around here someplace.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.758
Double-0 Shoe to Gold Digger,
do you read me?

14:27.680 --> 14:29.671
Yeah, this is Gold Digger.
What's up, Al?

14:29.920 --> 14:32.753
Code names, you idiot.

14:33.440 --> 14:36.238
Sorry, Double-0 Shoe.

14:37.640 --> 14:38.914
That's better.

14:39.160 --> 14:42.391
Is Son of Frank enstein
down there with you?

14:43.760 --> 14:46.479
Wait a sec. Can l please
have a better code name?

14:46.720 --> 14:50.429
Okay. You be Gold Digger.
l'll be Son of Frankenstein.

14:50.680 --> 14:54.355
Don't you mean
Bride of Frankenstein?

14:55.400 --> 14:58.073
-Why, you little bolt-neck--
-Hey, don't touch me.

14:58.320 --> 15:01.551
Focus, gentlemen. Focus.

15:02.160 --> 15:06.597
We are on a mission that involves
precise timing and ruthless efficiency.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.432
Now, l have checked the program...

15:08.680 --> 15:11.752
...and determined
the optimum moment to strike...

15:12.000 --> 15:15.072
...is when they play the fight song.

15:15.280 --> 15:18.033
Al, you're not paying
any attention to me.

15:18.280 --> 15:20.919
Well, l'm sorry, Peg.
You're looking quite...

15:21.320 --> 15:23.390
...adequate today.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.232
Oh, honey.

15:26.480 --> 15:28.948
l can't wait to get you home and....

15:39.200 --> 15:42.033
l always wanted to hear
a woman say that.

15:44.040 --> 15:46.110
Just not my own mother.

15:50.040 --> 15:53.999
Since Agent Orange
just breached my security...

15:54.240 --> 15:56.800
...this is the last radio contact
we'll have.

15:57.040 --> 16:00.157
We'll strike when they play
the school fight song.

16:00.400 --> 16:03.870
Halfway through
there is a cymbal crash.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.308
That is your cue.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.596
-Do you read?
-Got it, Double-0.

16:07.840 --> 16:09.717
Yeah, we're locked and loaded.

16:10.760 --> 16:13.832
ls this on? ls this on?

16:14.760 --> 16:17.399
lf you can hear me in the back,
please raise your hand.

16:17.640 --> 16:21.918
l don't think that particular gesture
is appropriate...

16:27.320 --> 16:28.992
...Al.

16:30.760 --> 16:33.479
l'm Marcie D'Arcy,
and l'd like to welcome you all...

16:33.720 --> 16:35.597
...on behalf of Kyoto National Bank...

16:35.800 --> 16:37.756
...where, when you open
a savings account...

16:37.960 --> 16:39.313
...we give you a free kimono.

16:41.720 --> 16:43.711
Or a six-pack.

16:46.240 --> 16:50.199
So without further ado, let's give
a traditional Polk High welcome...

16:50.400 --> 16:52.755
...a big round of applause
for our honoured guest...

16:53.000 --> 16:55.798
...Mr. Terry Bradshaw.

17:00.680 --> 17:01.999
They're applauding.

17:02.240 --> 17:06.153
Either Terry Bradshaw started speaking
or Mrs. D'Arcy stopped.

17:07.119 --> 17:08.348
Well, it doesn't matter.

17:08.599 --> 17:12.036
All we have to do is listen
for that cymbal crash.

17:21.079 --> 17:22.512
Popcorn?

17:22.760 --> 17:24.715
Don't mind if l do.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.472
Purse?

17:34.600 --> 17:36.795
So people often ask me...

17:37.000 --> 17:39.833
...how l threw
what was considered by many...

17:40.080 --> 17:45.757
...as the most famous pass of all time,
the immaculate reception.

17:46.400 --> 17:50.234
l tell them, it was very much
like at my bachelor's party...

17:50.480 --> 17:55.474
...where l just closed my eyes
and heaved.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.040
Gee, Al, you're taking this
rather maturely.

18:03.280 --> 18:07.353
Peg, l just figured it out that ultimately
everyone gets what they deserve.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.672
Well, l'm sure
you'll get yours, Daddy.

18:10.920 --> 18:12.876
You can say that again, pumpkin.

18:13.120 --> 18:16.669
Well, l'm sure
you'll get yours, Daddy.

18:17.360 --> 18:20.079
This award is truly a great honour...

18:20.320 --> 18:23.471
...and that's why this scoreboard
should be dedicated to someone...

18:23.720 --> 18:28.157
...that is as much a part
of Polk High football...

18:28.400 --> 18:33.076
...as these bleachers or that goal post
or the low test scores.

18:34.440 --> 18:36.874
What a blowhard.

18:37.320 --> 18:42.792
That's why this scoreboard
can only be named after one man.

18:43.960 --> 18:45.279
Al...

18:45.520 --> 18:49.149
...'' Four touchdowns
in a single game'' Bundy!

18:59.000 --> 19:02.515
Al, your name is on the scoreboard.

19:02.760 --> 19:06.548
Oh, Peg. l'm a field.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.758
Bundy, Bundy, Bundy.

19:11.360 --> 19:16.912
Hey, hey, Bud, sounds like
they're chanting, '' Bundy, Bundy.''

19:17.240 --> 19:20.152
Kelly probably just bent over
to pick up a quarter.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.749
Hey, okay. There's the band.

19:29.000 --> 19:34.597
Remember when we hear the cymbal,
we blow the scoreboard.

19:50.760 --> 19:52.079
Oh, no.

20:18.040 --> 20:20.429
No!

20:29.120 --> 20:32.157
And in other news, hundreds
of organizations are claiming credit...

20:32.360 --> 20:35.511
... for the bombing
of the Al Bundy scoreboard...

20:35.920 --> 20:38.309
... including the National Organization
Of Women...

20:38.560 --> 20:41.393
... the National Organization
of Fat Women...

20:41.640 --> 20:44.359
...and the government of France.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.758
Come on in.

20:49.440 --> 20:50.953
Daddy...

20:51.200 --> 20:55.079
...before Mr. Spamshank left...

20:55.760 --> 20:57.716
...he wanted to talk to you.

20:58.360 --> 20:59.793
Al...

21:00.240 --> 21:02.196
...l just wanted to say...

21:02.520 --> 21:04.670
...that despite everything...

21:04.920 --> 21:06.956
...l still respect you, man.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.078
l mean, you are without a doubt...

21:10.320 --> 21:14.359
...the greatest athlete
in Polk High history.

21:14.560 --> 21:17.711
l mean, that incredible run
that you had today...

21:17.920 --> 21:19.592
...just proved one thing to me, man.

21:19.800 --> 21:23.998
That you could have been
a big star in the NFL.

21:24.240 --> 21:26.470
l'll tell you something else, Al.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.438
You're my MVP.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.432
Push.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.319
Now, l know that Daddy
can't see, but that...

21:52.560 --> 21:55.472
...must have been
the new highlight of his life.

21:55.720 --> 21:58.712
Oh, well, probably not.

21:58.960 --> 22:01.394
He can't hear either.

22:02.305 --> 22:08.703
