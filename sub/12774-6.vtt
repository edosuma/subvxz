00:26.152 --> 00:27.361
You want me
to work with you?

00:27.445 --> 00:28.529
Given the
current climate,

00:28.612 --> 00:31.115
people need to be reminded
that Powers can make
a difference.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.951
But I'm working on the
Retro Girl murder case only.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.203
That case
is officially closed.

to shut us down for junk
and you can't!

00:39.832 --> 00:42.960
I'm gonna need
your badge...
and your gun.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.880
DEENA: If solving the murder
is insubordination,

00:45.963 --> 00:47.381
I guess I'm guilty.

00:47.673 --> 00:48.966
CRAIG: We already
ate this one...

00:49.049 --> 00:50.759

Want the new one.

You're saying...

00:51.927 --> 00:54.263
I believe...
Derick Warner...

00:54.346 --> 00:55.681
...also known as Heavy,

00:55.806 --> 00:59.268
a hired assassin,

You realize that you have
a gargantuan target painted

01:06.317 --> 01:08.486
on your back
with that TV interview?

01:08.569 --> 01:10.237
You might say he's,
kind of, proud of it.

01:10.321 --> 01:12.239
Yeah, I'd wear
neon sign on my head

01:12.323 --> 01:14.533
if it would bring that
son of a bitch out
in the open.

01:14.658 --> 01:17.077
Seems to me Heavy does not
want to come out to play.

01:17.161 --> 01:19.330
Then I'll just have
to keep forcing his
hand until he does.

01:19.413 --> 01:23.584
So you know, 38.235% chance
that he killed Retro Girl.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.920
Good enough for me.
38? What...what the fuck?

01:26.003 --> 01:27.338
How did you come up
with that?

01:27.421 --> 01:30.090

easier for you?

got for us?

I have no idea.

02:08.379 --> 02:11.924

just close your eyes.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.498
It's okay.

11:04.581 --> 11:07.084
Now,
imagine this room...

11:07.709 --> 11:09.461
...and it's filled
with people.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.171
This room is
just packed

11:11.254 --> 11:13.840
with people who
are waiting for you.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.593
They want to hear you
say something.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.846
They want to hear you
say something inspiring.

11:20.222 --> 11:22.015
They want to hear about
how you grew up,

11:22.099 --> 11:24.309
just idolizing Retro Girl
and Triphammer.

11:24.434 --> 11:27.729
And how you dreamed of one day
taking your place among them.

11:29.523 --> 11:31.817
Forget about the script.
Okay, the words don't matter.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.944
Just speak
from your heart,

11:34.069 --> 11:36.279
and say whatever
is on your mind.

11:38.323 --> 11:41.076
I want everyone here
to see what I see.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.704
I want them to see
that Powers are important,

11:46.289 --> 11:48.291
and that you are
taking up their mantle.

11:49.126 --> 11:51.336
You are making the world
a better place,

11:51.461 --> 11:53.797
a safer place, just like
Janice and Harley did.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.385
I couple make this speech,
and I usually do,

11:59.469 --> 12:01.221
but I'm giving it
to you.

12:01.304 --> 12:05.475
This honor is yours
because I believe in you.

12:06.184 --> 12:08.103
I know that you
can do this.

12:09.855 --> 12:11.982
This is your moment
to shine.

12:13.441 --> 12:16.695
You will make
them proud. I promise.
(CHUCKLES)

12:18.155 --> 12:20.907
Okay.
Okay, go again.

12:22.826 --> 12:23.952
My daughter is napping

12:24.035 --> 12:26.955
and I'm getting ready for this
ridiculous, fucking gala,

12:27.038 --> 12:30.125
so what is so important
that it can't wait?

12:30.208 --> 12:31.251
We need to have
a little chat

12:31.334 --> 12:33.086
about the night
Retro Girl was murdered.

12:34.129 --> 12:35.213
Didn't we
do this already?

12:35.338 --> 12:36.548
WALKER: We did.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.008
We need to do it again.

12:39.551 --> 12:41.636
Okay. (CHUCKLES)

12:42.554 --> 12:43.805
Thank you.

12:44.681 --> 12:45.682
(SIGHS)

12:45.807 --> 12:47.225
Honestly,

12:47.350 --> 12:49.352
everything
since that night

12:49.436 --> 12:51.229
has been one big...

12:51.605 --> 12:53.023
...ugly blur.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.483
It really hit you hard,
didn't it?

12:56.443 --> 12:59.070
(SCOFFS)
Hit me hard. Yeah.

12:59.738 --> 13:01.907
Janice was
more than a client.

13:02.032 --> 13:04.117
She was, uh...
Your friend, we know.

13:04.576 --> 13:07.120
You probably knew her
better than anyone, right?

13:07.204 --> 13:08.538
I suppose.

13:08.663 --> 13:11.917
So, you would know
what was on her mind
before her death.

13:12.375 --> 13:13.543
What was
important to her.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.046
Um...

13:16.880 --> 13:18.215
Well, her work...

13:18.298 --> 13:19.925
...and, um, her charity.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.384
She was quitting,
wasn't she?

13:23.178 --> 13:24.554
That was her future.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.766
A normal life...

13:27.891 --> 13:29.267
...with me.

13:29.392 --> 13:31.811
No celebrity bullshit.

13:32.270 --> 13:33.897
DEENA: Then the D-Day
on her calendar

13:33.980 --> 13:35.982
was the day she was planning
to drop PAR.

13:36.066 --> 13:37.901
WALKER: So what?
She told you this?

13:38.735 --> 13:40.028
And what?

13:41.279 --> 13:42.405
You had her killed?

13:42.530 --> 13:43.573
Jesus Christian.

13:43.657 --> 13:46.201
Probably didn't realize
she left us a clue.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.620
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

13:48.745 --> 13:49.955
In her hand.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.414
In her goddamned hand!

13:51.539 --> 13:52.707
A little piece
of plastic.

13:52.791 --> 13:54.334
It was an
action figure, wasn't it?

13:54.417 --> 13:56.294
One of those things
you make so much money off of.

13:56.419 --> 13:59.130
She grabbed it
just before she fucking died!

13:59.256 --> 14:00.924
She knew I would
figure it out,

14:01.049 --> 14:02.926
and it would lead me
back to you, Craig!

14:03.009 --> 14:04.427
I didn't kill her.
I didn't...

14:04.511 --> 14:06.346
I swear on my daughter's life
I didn't fucking do it.

14:06.429 --> 14:07.973
Then who?

14:08.431 --> 14:10.100
Who? Motherfucker!

14:10.183 --> 14:11.142
DEENA: Walker,
Walker, breath.

14:11.268 --> 14:13.937
Take a step back.
Take a breath.

14:14.104 --> 14:15.438
Take a breath.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.107
You need to tell us
the truth.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.191
We can protect you,

14:18.275 --> 14:20.402
but you need to tell us
the truth and now.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.904
I can't.
I can't talk to you.

14:23.822 --> 14:25.115
I can't...

14:25.573 --> 14:27.993
I can't talk to anyone.
Got it?

14:28.118 --> 14:30.287
Okay,
I understand you.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.788
We can take you
to Powers Division.

14:31.913 --> 14:33.790
(LAUGHS)
We will keep you safe there.

14:34.332 --> 14:35.458
Powers?

14:35.792 --> 14:37.961
I'm not leaving here
without you. You understand?

14:38.962 --> 14:42.173
I am not leaving here
without you.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.226
I have to speak
to my husband.

14:53.310 --> 14:54.936
Absolutely.
We'll wait.

14:58.189 --> 14:59.190
Um...

14:59.941 --> 15:01.318
You'll keep them safe?

15:01.443 --> 15:03.987
You'll protect them,
my family?

15:04.070 --> 15:05.488
Of course, we will.

15:06.489 --> 15:07.657
Thank you.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.160
You're doing
the right thing.

15:15.165 --> 15:16.416
Did he say "them?"

15:16.499 --> 15:17.500
Why didn't he say,
"Protect us?"

15:17.584 --> 15:19.336
He said, "protect them,"
right?

15:21.046 --> 15:22.380
Fuck! Walker!

15:22.839 --> 15:24.215
(GUNSHOT)

15:24.674 --> 15:27.427
LANGE: What the fuck
were you doing at
Craig Sherman's house?

15:28.219 --> 15:29.596
Just asking questions.

15:29.679 --> 15:32.182
LANGE: Unauthorized questions
that led him to stick a gun

15:32.307 --> 15:34.434
in his head
and blow his brains out!

15:35.352 --> 15:38.563
WALKER: Which actually
confirmed our suspicions.

15:38.688 --> 15:39.773
Suspicions?

15:39.981 --> 15:42.901
Yeah, that he witnessed
Janice's murder.

15:43.777 --> 15:46.404
Of course you have a sworn
statement to that effect?

15:46.529 --> 15:49.783
WALKER: You know, technically
we're not police officers,
so no.

15:49.866 --> 15:52.535
It was a social meeting.
So, fuck you, Agent Amazon.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.120
WALKER: Deena...
DEENA: I can
say that to you...

15:54.204 --> 15:56.039
...now that I don't fucking
work for you!

15:56.164 --> 15:58.083
She's not going
to tell us shit.
I'm done here.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.380
Your partner has a bit
of an attitude problem.

16:03.505 --> 16:06.049
No, actually, uh,
she just doesn't like you.

16:06.132 --> 16:08.510
Did you learn
anything useful...

16:09.177 --> 16:11.471
...from the dearly departed
Craig Sherman?

16:11.888 --> 16:14.182
(SCOFFS) I'm not
gonna play this game

16:14.265 --> 16:15.350
with you anymore,
Angela.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.227
Two of my friends
were killed

16:17.352 --> 16:19.604
by one of
your operatives.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.023
So please,
stop pretending

16:22.107 --> 16:24.943
that you're not working
the same case
that I'm working.

16:25.068 --> 16:26.277
Give me
what you got,

16:26.403 --> 16:28.321
so that I can catch
the fucking guy.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.824
The FBI, CIA
and INTERPOL

16:30.907 --> 16:34.702
have searched every nook
and cranny for 10 years.

16:34.786 --> 16:37.247
If you see him at all, it's
because he's coming after you!

16:37.580 --> 16:39.040
Isn't that what
you're betting on?

16:39.749 --> 16:40.834
(SCOFFS)

16:41.626 --> 16:43.420
Grab him
after he kills me?

16:43.962 --> 16:45.088
Hopefully before.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.090
(CHUCKLES)
This is your problem.

16:47.215 --> 16:48.633
You put yourself
into this position

16:48.758 --> 16:50.677
with that stupid,
fucking TV interview.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.429
Oh, that is
such bullshit!

16:52.512 --> 16:54.472
I can...
You can't beat Heavy!

16:54.597 --> 16:56.141
You think
I don't know that?

16:57.225 --> 17:00.019
You...you think I don't know
that if he comes after me,

17:00.103 --> 17:01.813
I'm a fucking dead man,
Angela?

17:01.938 --> 17:03.815
You know what?
I don't care anymore.

17:03.940 --> 17:04.983
Do you hear me?
Stop.

17:05.108 --> 17:06.276
I don't give a fuck.
Stop.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.236
I know how much
this means to you, Christian,

17:08.862 --> 17:11.114
especially now that Harley
was taken out.

17:11.197 --> 17:12.991
But you can't just go rogue.
(EXHALES)

17:15.618 --> 17:16.995
So then help me.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.915
Tell me what you know,
so I can nail this fucker.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.504
Talk to me,
for fuck's sake!

17:32.427 --> 17:33.428
(DOOR SLAMS)

17:35.472 --> 17:37.557
Come with me.
(STAMMERS) What are you doing?

17:37.640 --> 17:38.808
WALKER: Research.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.187
I think I know
what it is.

17:42.312 --> 17:43.271
FULLER: What "what" is?

17:43.354 --> 17:44.939
WALKER: That, uh,
thing in her hand.

17:45.023 --> 17:46.524
I think it's
an action figure.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.487
Makes sense.
A lot of sense, actually.

17:50.612 --> 17:51.654
Yeah, I need proof.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.073
Just...so how's it coming
with the computer modeling?

17:54.157 --> 17:56.117
Fragmentary.
What?

17:56.201 --> 17:58.286
Oh, we only needed it
like yesterday.
WALKER: Fuck.

17:58.369 --> 17:59.829
It's not
a perfect technology.

17:59.954 --> 18:01.372
WALKER: Okay.
It doesn't matter.

18:01.498 --> 18:02.832
I suspect
it's an action figure,

18:02.957 --> 18:05.585
and Craig all
but told us

18:05.668 --> 18:07.504
that she was at
PAR that night.

18:07.629 --> 18:10.882
Ugh, so we're going to need
camera surveillance footage.

18:11.341 --> 18:12.425
Yeah.
Already done.

18:12.509 --> 18:13.968
WALKER: What?

18:14.052 --> 18:15.595
Agent Lange had me
pull the security video

18:15.678 --> 18:17.764
from the PAR building
after Sherman's suicide.

18:18.348 --> 18:19.891
Of course she did.
(LAUGHS)

18:20.016 --> 18:21.768
I'm telling you, Retro Girl
wasn't there that night.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.019
What about Craig?
Show me.

18:23.102 --> 18:26.022
Until he left work
around 7:00 after that,
nada.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.690
Okay. Is this every angle?

18:27.815 --> 18:30.026
Yeah, front entrance,
emergency exits,

18:30.109 --> 18:32.779
underground parking
structures, loading docks.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.531
(BEEPS)
I mean,
we pulled everything.

18:34.656 --> 18:36.491
Retro Girl wasn't anywhere
near that building.

18:36.574 --> 18:37.867
Okay.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.246
I think the FBI could have
scrubbed the footage.

18:41.371 --> 18:43.373
Or she was someplace
else that night.

18:48.878 --> 18:51.089
Okay, what about
outside the building?

18:53.049 --> 18:55.051
Well, I mean, LAPD works
with downtown merchants

18:55.176 --> 18:57.887
to cover pretty much
every inch of the city, so...

19:00.390 --> 19:01.724
WALKER: Excuse me?

19:03.560 --> 19:05.853
You...you want me to...
Here?
Dude.

19:05.937 --> 19:06.980
I... I can't even guarantee

19:07.063 --> 19:09.315
that I can get
into the system from here.

19:09.399 --> 19:11.568
I mean, plus your
Wi-Fi is shit.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.153
So, even if I can,
it's gonna be jumpy...

19:14.237 --> 19:16.573
...and it's probably
gonna lag.
Just humor us.

19:22.579 --> 19:24.539
Hmm, uh...
Front entrance
of the PAR building.

19:24.622 --> 19:25.748
Night of the murder.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.166
Has Lange asked for this?

19:27.250 --> 19:28.793
Not yet,
but she will.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.420
She's very thorough.

19:30.545 --> 19:33.047
That's a very polite word
for an obsessive compulsive...

19:33.131 --> 19:34.632
...anal bitch from the pits...
Mmm-mmm.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.843
Okay, what about, uh,

19:36.926 --> 19:39.262
angles from other buildings
on the same block.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.597
Mmm.

19:42.265 --> 19:45.018
WALKER: Looking back
at the PAR build... Yes!

19:45.101 --> 19:47.437
Loading dock.
What is this, in the glass?

19:47.729 --> 19:49.230
The reflection.
Can you get closer?

19:49.314 --> 19:52.066
Zoom in? (CHUCKLES)
Of course, I can zoom in.

19:52.150 --> 19:53.234
Zoom in.

19:53.318 --> 19:54.444
I'm sorry.
(BEEPS)

19:54.944 --> 19:56.779
(BEEPING)

19:57.530 --> 19:58.990
Holy fuck, it's her.

19:59.115 --> 20:00.908
Damn! She was there.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.368
Call Kutter.

20:03.244 --> 20:04.370
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

20:05.747 --> 20:06.706
Hi, Detectives.

20:06.789 --> 20:08.458
I'm Dr. Marrs.
Uh...

20:08.708 --> 20:10.501
Hi.
Where's Dr. Death?

20:10.960 --> 20:12.629
Pregnant.
What?

20:12.712 --> 20:14.797
Uh, no, not him,
his...his wife.

20:15.298 --> 20:17.383
So you're FBI?

20:17.800 --> 20:19.344
Please. LAPD.

20:19.469 --> 20:20.762
I'm Michelle Marrs,

20:20.845 --> 20:23.139
handling Powers Division
while he's on leave.

20:23.264 --> 20:25.808
I covered Craig Sherman's
crime scene with
Detective Kutter,

20:25.892 --> 20:27.060
Bummer he
wasn't a Power.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.728
Always wanted
to cut open a Power.

20:28.811 --> 20:31.314
Yeah, uh,
fuck Craig, okay?

20:31.397 --> 20:33.566
What did you find here?
Uh, language.

20:33.650 --> 20:36.277
By the by, per Kutter,
I didn't see you two here,
just so you know.

20:36.361 --> 20:37.320
Hmm.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.155
What did you find
in Sherman's office?

20:39.238 --> 20:41.157
Well, no need to look,
according to Dr. Marrs.

20:41.282 --> 20:43.493
My nose caught this one
when I exited the elevator.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.078
Your nose?
Hyper sensitive.

20:45.161 --> 20:46.496
It's a gift.

blood evidence.

20:51.376 --> 20:52.502
Lots of it.

20:52.585 --> 20:53.586
Jesus!

20:54.170 --> 20:56.172
(SIGHS) See the edge
of the glass table?

20:56.297 --> 20:57.548
I took a measurement
and the height...

20:57.674 --> 20:59.384
Matches the cut
on her leg.

20:59.509 --> 21:02.261
DNA pending,
I call this the crime scene.

21:05.890 --> 21:08.017
You two better hit
the elevator before
the feds show up.

21:11.521 --> 21:12.689
We gotta go.

21:12.814 --> 21:14.065

you had uniform like that.

Dress blues. I thought it was
appropriate, considering.

21:36.546 --> 21:39.799
(SIGHS) Triphammer told me
this was a dangerous world.

21:39.882 --> 21:41.718
I thought this was nothing
compared to Fallujah,

21:41.843 --> 21:44.595

21:46.139 --> 21:48.307

before I should.

21:50.226 --> 21:51.853
He saw a lot
of strength in you.

21:53.396 --> 21:54.605
And potential.

21:55.732 --> 21:56.941
In you too.

22:05.950 --> 22:08.411
I don't believe
you were on the guest list.

22:08.494 --> 22:10.288
(SCOFFS) I'm betting
you weren't, either.

22:10.913 --> 22:12.081

22:12.540 --> 22:14.125
At a party like this?

22:14.250 --> 22:15.501
Conrad asked
for special protection

22:15.585 --> 22:17.044
after the Triphammer
incident.

22:17.128 --> 22:18.921
Oh, now it's... (CHUCKLES)
Now it's Conrad?

22:19.005 --> 22:21.382
Well, adapt to
the circumstances at hand,
Christian.

22:21.466 --> 22:22.842
Atleast some of us do.

22:22.925 --> 22:24.594
I'd like to talk to him,
if you don't mind.

22:24.677 --> 22:26.679
Well, I'm afraid
he doesn't want
to talk to you.

22:26.763 --> 22:28.014
Did he tell you
that personally?

22:28.097 --> 22:29.432
He didn't need to.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.227
What's going on?
Are you expecting Heavy?

22:34.687 --> 22:36.773
You are.
That's why you're here.

22:37.315 --> 22:39.108
Well, you should,
you should invite me in.

22:39.192 --> 22:41.819

now that I've arrived here.

is the only man

23:13.684 --> 23:15.603
in the entire world who can
get away with calling me that.

23:15.686 --> 23:17.355
And you know why?
I will tell you why.

23:17.480 --> 23:21.901
Because Diamond is
the greatest super hero
who ever lived.

Wolfe stole your powers.

23:30.409 --> 23:31.369

my favorite.

you were my favorite.

that isn't true.

23:44.674 --> 23:46.175
You're nothing like him.

ever did was die.

of being here among you.

that keeps us safe.

and Triphammer...

25:06.172 --> 25:08.257
...whose loss
we mourn today.

25:08.925 --> 25:11.260
They were Powers
that made me...

25:12.428 --> 25:13.512
Us...

25:14.555 --> 25:16.641
...feel proud
of who we are.

25:17.767 --> 25:20.937
But what I've learned,
or rather what I'm learning,

25:21.062 --> 25:23.147
is that being able
to fly...

25:23.272 --> 25:24.774
...or punch a hole
in a concrete wall,

25:24.899 --> 25:26.609
which is pretty damn cool,
don't get me wrong...

25:26.734 --> 25:28.235
(LAUGHING)

25:29.028 --> 25:31.113
That's not what
makes you a Power.

25:31.489 --> 25:32.823
What you do with it,

25:32.949 --> 25:34.617
how you make a difference,

25:35.868 --> 25:37.620

of Retro Girl

every single day.

hold you to that, girl.

I'm probably dead.

drunk I neglected to
reset the timer.

I'm dead,

27:42.912 --> 27:46.248
then, well,
I'm guessing I'm dead.

I have no regrets,

means shit,

that you're not cops,

41:56.181 --> 41:59.017
because that was
real evidence,

41:59.100 --> 42:00.810
and it's gone now
forever.

42:00.936 --> 42:02.771
You're fucking with me,
rip your fucking throat out!

42:02.896 --> 42:04.189
Okay, okay, okay.
WALKER: You're a dead man.

42:04.272 --> 42:05.482
Do you understand me?
Okay, yeah.

42:05.607 --> 42:06.608
I'm coming with you, dude.

42:06.733 --> 42:08.068
We are gonna go downtown
together, okay?

42:08.151 --> 42:09.444
Okay?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

42:09.569 --> 42:10.820
I'm gonna come with you
downtown...

42:11.655 --> 42:13.156
...because it
doesn't matter.

42:16.660 --> 42:17.786
(GRUNTS)

42:17.869 --> 42:19.621
(YELLS) Fuck!
Walker! Walker!

42:21.790 --> 42:22.791
Grab my hand.

42:24.626 --> 42:26.461
Got it! Come.
(GRUNTING)

42:28.880 --> 42:30.340
(GRUNTING)

42:30.715 --> 42:32.008
(STRAINING)

42:32.634 --> 42:34.094
Don't let me fall.

42:34.177 --> 42:35.679
(INDISTINCT)

42:36.763 --> 42:38.473
Come on, Walker!

42:38.556 --> 42:40.642
(SCREAMING)

42:41.434 --> 42:43.395
(SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE)

42:49.818 --> 42:51.486
(WIND HOWLING)

43:02.539 --> 43:03.581
Oh!

43:03.665 --> 43:04.833
(GRUNTS)

43:07.335 --> 43:09.004
Looks like
you needed me after all.

43:53.256 --> 43:54.674
Hey... (CHUCKLES)

43:55.550 --> 43:57.093
Thanks for the loan.

43:58.553 --> 44:00.055
You make that
look good.

44:00.180 --> 44:01.389
Yeah?
Yeah.

44:01.806 --> 44:03.725
It feels good
to take the glam off.

44:04.934 --> 44:06.811
Anything in Triphammer's
files for us?

44:06.895 --> 44:09.606
I have no idea, they read
like Ikea instructions.

44:09.731 --> 44:10.815
(BEEPING)

44:24.454 --> 44:25.789
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

44:27.749 --> 44:29.918
I guess the Chinese
food is here.
(CHUCKLES)

44:30.418 --> 44:32.128
Hello,
moo shu man.

44:36.758 --> 44:37.759
Hey!

44:37.884 --> 44:38.885
Hi.

44:39.594 --> 44:41.679
Um, I...

44:41.763 --> 44:44.682
...was wondering...if...

44:44.766 --> 44:46.184
Took you long enough.

44:46.976 --> 44:48.061
Come on.

44:55.276 --> 44:57.112
Hope you like
Chinese food.

44:57.821 --> 44:59.364
Who doesn't like
Chinese?
