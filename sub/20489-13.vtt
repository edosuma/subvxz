00:24.424 --> 00:26.026
My car's
not far from here.

00:26.426 --> 00:28.428
I'm calling it a night.

00:28.828 --> 00:30.030
Coming home?

00:30.065 --> 00:31.596
Umm...

00:31.631 --> 00:35.235
after i walk dana to her car.

00:35.270 --> 00:38.003
See you soon.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.639
Not too soon, i hope.

01:35.295 --> 01:37.697
Who the hell are you and
why are you following me?

01:37.732 --> 01:39.664
It's me, jesse.

01:39.699 --> 01:42.867
I... i can't believe it.

01:42.902 --> 01:45.705
<laughing> hey,
you're getting bigger.

01:45.740 --> 01:47.925
Hitting the gym, huh?

01:47.960 --> 01:50.436
Oh, it's good to see you.

01:50.471 --> 01:52.877
Uh, what are you doing here?

01:52.912 --> 01:54.514
I'm on an
undercover assignment.

01:54.914 --> 01:56.516
It's gotten kind of ugly.

02:03.323 --> 02:04.124
What's going on?

02:04.524 --> 02:05.725
I'm in a little
bit of trouble.

02:10.930 --> 02:11.731
Who are these guys?

02:12.132 --> 02:13.298
Nexxogen security.

02:13.333 --> 02:14.934
Well, we gotta
get out of here.

02:15.335 --> 02:16.536
Now.

02:31.751 --> 02:33.353
You can't keep
running, noah.

02:33.388 --> 02:34.554
Give it up.

02:36.556 --> 02:37.757
Noah!

02:44.164 --> 02:45.330
Noah!

02:45.365 --> 02:46.566
Get out of the way!

02:55.775 --> 02:57.777
He's one of
eckhart's new mutants.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.785
Noah.

03:23.403 --> 03:24.969
Hey, you okay?

03:25.004 --> 03:27.006
What the
hell happened here?

03:27.041 --> 03:29.008
My dad showed up.

04:40.546 --> 04:41.748
And all of a sudden
- bam - there he was,

04:41.783 --> 04:43.166
standing right in front of me.

04:43.201 --> 04:44.550
I mean, it was... it was great.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.152
I've never heard you
talk about your dad before.

04:46.552 --> 04:47.754
Oh, that's because i don't
get to see him very much.

04:48.154 --> 04:49.756
He's a covert operative, so
he's always away on assignment.

04:49.791 --> 04:51.174
Thanks.

04:51.209 --> 04:52.523
What?

04:52.558 --> 04:54.560
I've just never
seen you this happy
- or this wired.

04:54.595 --> 04:57.328
Well, it's great
to see him again.

04:57.363 --> 05:00.166
But, um, i am a little
concerned about what's
happening with him?

05:00.566 --> 05:02.568
Who did
you say was after him?

05:02.603 --> 05:04.535
Nexxogen.

05:04.570 --> 05:06.973
It's a bioengineering firm
specialising in the genetic

05:07.008 --> 05:08.574
replication of protoplasm.

05:08.609 --> 05:09.776
You mean cloning.

05:09.811 --> 05:10.942
In a way.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.578
And it seems likely that
genomex has had something

05:12.613 --> 05:13.780
to do with them in the past.

05:14.180 --> 05:15.346
Outsourcing?

05:15.381 --> 05:16.948
I remember we heard
about nexxogen last year:

05:16.983 --> 05:18.985
They had an industrial accident
outside the city of martez?

05:19.020 --> 05:20.186
Right. Big fire
at their facility.

05:20.586 --> 05:21.387
Yeah.

05:21.788 --> 05:23.389
Didn't they blame that
on a gas leak or something?

05:23.424 --> 05:24.555
Yeah.

05:24.590 --> 05:26.192
Hey, maybe... maybe
my dad's investigating it.

05:26.227 --> 05:27.358
He could be.

05:27.393 --> 05:28.594
Have you heard from him again?

05:28.629 --> 05:29.796
No, not yet. Why?

05:29.831 --> 05:30.596
All right.

05:30.997 --> 05:31.798
You let me know
the minute he calls.

05:32.198 --> 05:33.399
Maybe we can
do something to help.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.600
Okay.

05:43.810 --> 05:46.612
Mr. Eckhart, sir?

05:47.013 --> 05:49.415
My name is calvin porter and
i was hoping to speak to you

05:49.450 --> 05:50.982
about a promotion.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.820
I understand a field agent
position has just opened up and

05:53.855 --> 05:55.421
i'd like to be
considered for the job.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.023
That information was classified.

05:57.423 --> 05:59.425
Whoever told you about
that is in serious trouble.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.392
Actually, i heard
it from you, sir.

06:01.427 --> 06:03.830
I'm a new mutant with
genetically enhanced hearing.

06:03.865 --> 06:05.031
Is that so?

06:05.431 --> 06:06.597
Yes, sir.

06:06.632 --> 06:09.034
In fact, the sounds of the
world nearly drove me out of my

06:09.069 --> 06:11.437
mind, until the genomex biotech
lab created this audio filter.

06:11.472 --> 06:14.240
Now i can pinpoint any
frequency over many miles.

06:14.275 --> 06:16.607
A great advantage
in a field agent.

06:16.642 --> 06:20.646
Well, mr. Porter, with
those outstanding abilities,

06:20.681 --> 06:22.613
i assume you'll be

06:22.648 --> 06:28.254
able to hear this: Don't ever
speak to me directly again.

06:28.289 --> 06:30.221
I don't care.

06:30.256 --> 06:33.459
Tell eckhart that nicole
carter's here to see him.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.862
What it is it?

06:36.262 --> 06:38.264
There's a woman named nicole
carter here to see you.

06:38.299 --> 06:41.067
And she's giving
your assistant hell.

06:44.670 --> 06:47.073
Call off your dogs, eckhart.

06:47.108 --> 06:49.075
We have to talk.

06:49.475 --> 06:50.641
Of course.

06:50.676 --> 06:51.878
Thank you, gentlemen.

06:51.913 --> 06:53.479
That'll be all.

06:55.481 --> 06:57.083
How can i
help you, miss carter?

06:57.118 --> 06:57.884
We've got a problem...

06:57.919 --> 06:59.102
we?

06:59.137 --> 07:00.251
We.

07:00.286 --> 07:02.253
A member of my security
staff invaded our database and

07:02.288 --> 07:05.892
downloaded sensitive information
regarding the martez incident.

07:05.927 --> 07:07.093
How awful for you.

07:07.493 --> 07:09.060
I'm not alone out
on this limb, eckhart.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.898
Genomex shares responsibility
for what happened there.

07:11.933 --> 07:13.865
It's fascinating.

07:13.900 --> 07:16.302
We have entirely different
memories of that tragedy.

07:16.702 --> 07:18.704
And as far as
the public is concerned,

07:19.105 --> 07:21.072
genomex saved nexxogen
from bankruptcy.

07:21.107 --> 07:25.511
Which i've always regarded as an
act of unbelievable generosity

07:25.912 --> 07:29.916
- since your company is
technically our competition.

07:29.951 --> 07:31.918
Is that how we're
going to play this game?

07:31.953 --> 07:35.086
Well, let me be more clear.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.924
A computer disk with information
implicating your company

07:38.324 --> 07:40.326
in that incident
has been stolen.

07:40.726 --> 07:43.129
If this information
comes to light,

07:43.529 --> 07:47.533
the world will learn that martez
was no industrial accident.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.135
In other words...

07:49.535 --> 07:51.938
if i go down, you go down.

07:56.342 --> 07:58.944
I'll put my agents
at your disposal.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.664
I thought that
might change your tune.

08:01.699 --> 08:04.350
We need to get that
disk back immediately.

08:04.385 --> 08:06.717
You think?

08:06.752 --> 08:10.356
Oh, and i believe
one of your new mutants
is standing in our way.

08:10.391 --> 08:12.976
One of my men
wrapped a car around him

08:13.011 --> 08:15.561
- but he walked
away without a scratch.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.163
I'll see if i can help.

08:17.198 --> 08:19.165
You do that.

08:29.575 --> 08:31.577
Mr. Porter.

08:31.978 --> 08:33.980
Since i assume you've
been eavesdropping already,

08:34.015 --> 08:35.947
i have an assignment for you.

08:35.982 --> 08:38.784
Get that disk nexxogen is
chasing and you might just

08:39.184 --> 08:41.187
earn yourself that promotion.

08:56.802 --> 08:58.369
How you doing?

08:58.404 --> 09:00.406
I'll be doing a lot
better when my dad calls.

09:06.412 --> 09:08.814
I saw the picture the two
of you you got in your room.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.416
Oh, the father-son
martial arts tournament.

09:20.426 --> 09:21.993
Yeah.

09:22.028 --> 09:25.231
We went every year
until my parents split up.

09:25.631 --> 09:28.034
My dad's job
with the feds took him
undercover and overseas.

09:28.069 --> 09:30.436
Is that why
i never met him?

09:30.471 --> 09:31.637
No.

09:32.038 --> 09:34.440
I haven't even seen him
since he went off to europe.

09:34.840 --> 09:38.044
You okay?

09:38.444 --> 09:41.647
You look a little
worried about him.

09:41.682 --> 09:44.415
The guy is
a decorated hero.

09:44.450 --> 09:48.454
He's been on a lot of
assignments, but something's...

09:48.854 --> 09:52.023
something's different.

09:52.058 --> 09:54.060
Well, if you need any of
us to jump in and help,

09:54.095 --> 09:56.462
you just say the word.

09:56.862 --> 09:58.864
Thank you.

10:00.866 --> 10:02.033
Oh, hey.

10:02.068 --> 10:04.070
I did a little nosing around
in nexxogen's personnel files.

10:04.105 --> 10:05.271
Yeah?

10:05.671 --> 10:07.273
It turns out, noah kilmartin
was listed as the head of

10:07.308 --> 10:09.275
security until a month ago.

10:09.310 --> 10:10.441
He works for them?

10:10.476 --> 10:12.043
Yeah,
until he got fired.

10:12.078 --> 10:13.879
Seems like they might
have tried to screw him over.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.681
Well, let's keep digging
before we pass judgement.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.248
What else did you find?

10:17.283 --> 10:20.085
Some interesting
information on nicole carter.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.888
She's the director
of operations at nexxogen.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.455
Since before the explosion.

10:24.490 --> 10:26.292
Yeah, she must
be pretty powerful

10:26.327 --> 10:28.094
- or bulletproof
- to have lasted.

10:28.494 --> 10:29.660
Yeah,
maybe a little of both.

10:29.695 --> 10:31.697
According to this, nexxogen
would've gone belly-up if they

10:31.732 --> 10:33.699
hadn't gotten
funding from genomex.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.266
Exactly. But...

10:35.301 --> 10:37.503
why would eckhart want
to keep them in business?

10:37.538 --> 10:39.705
Well, my first guess is
that genomex had something

10:39.740 --> 10:41.272
to do with the incident.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.309
Well,
do you think jesse's father
is tied to the incident too?

10:43.709 --> 10:45.711
I think i know
a way we can find out.

10:53.719 --> 10:55.286
Dad?

10:55.321 --> 10:56.922
Sorry about last night, jesse.

10:57.323 --> 11:00.926
I didn't mean
to run out on you and leave
you in the lurch like that.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.146
You all right?

11:03.181 --> 11:05.296
Oh, i'll live.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.533
But i didn't want to
get you involved in this.

11:07.568 --> 11:09.735
I... i just had no
idea where else to turn.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.737
No.
Forget about it.
We're family.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.156
Let me come get you.

11:13.191 --> 11:14.505
Oh, i don't know.

11:14.540 --> 11:16.542
In fact, the situation is
kind of dangerous right now.

11:16.942 --> 11:19.345
And all the
more reason why we should
be handling this together.

11:19.380 --> 11:20.511
All right.

11:20.546 --> 11:22.913
But you have to come alone.

11:22.948 --> 11:25.751
And you have to promise not
to tell anybody about this.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.353
You think he'd be up for it?

11:27.388 --> 11:29.355
Let me talk to him.

11:29.755 --> 11:30.956
Check it out.

11:32.158 --> 11:34.160
Jesse?
Are you still there?

11:34.195 --> 11:36.162
Yeah. I'm here, dad. But...

11:36.197 --> 11:39.182
look, there's no buts.

11:39.217 --> 11:42.168
Okay. I won't tell anyone.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.740
That's my boy.

11:49.775 --> 11:51.342
I knew i
could count on you.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.379
Look, i still think we're
taking a big chance here.

11:53.414 --> 11:55.781
And that's a
chance we have to take.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.348
If you say so.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.350
Now, where are you?

11:59.385 --> 12:02.188
Okay. I'll be in the courtyard
of the fairview complex.

12:02.588 --> 12:04.590
I'm on my way.

12:04.625 --> 12:06.592
Got him. Let's go.

12:09.795 --> 12:10.561
Hey, adam.

12:10.596 --> 12:12.198
You ready to give
nexxogen a visit?

12:12.233 --> 12:13.364
Absolutely.

12:13.399 --> 12:14.965
I want you
both to be careful.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.803
So brennan tells us to be
on heightened security alert?

12:17.838 --> 12:19.405
Yeah, but we'll
have you covered on that.

12:19.440 --> 12:20.571
Here, emma.

12:20.606 --> 12:23.208
Give me your thumb.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.811
A little press.

12:26.212 --> 12:27.213
Ow.

12:27.248 --> 12:28.214
Sorry.

12:29.815 --> 12:31.817
They screen
all their employees through
thumbprint identification.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.436
This'll get you in.

12:33.471 --> 12:35.020
<laughing> big baby.

12:36.622 --> 12:38.624
So what's the best place
to tap into their database?

12:38.659 --> 12:40.626
Ah,
their main computer system.

12:40.661 --> 12:42.193
Sorry.

12:42.228 --> 12:44.230
From there, we can
access all their files.

12:44.265 --> 12:46.597
And with this
little baby over here,

12:46.632 --> 12:49.034
we can have you in and
out in a couple of minutes.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.402
What do we do with it?

12:51.437 --> 12:53.439
Install
it into their system and
then we can copy all the

12:53.474 --> 12:55.841
files here at sanctuary
without detection.

12:56.242 --> 12:57.843
Great.
Let's get to work.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.462
Good luck.

12:59.497 --> 13:01.046
Thanks.

13:06.652 --> 13:07.853
Hey.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.857
It's just me, or you
been a little awol since
your dad popped up?

13:11.892 --> 13:13.824
No, i've been around.

13:13.859 --> 13:15.060
I've just been keeping busy.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.627
Huh, yeah.

13:16.662 --> 13:18.664
So adam
and i did a little
research on nexxogen.

13:18.699 --> 13:20.666
Sounds like your dad
had a pretty rough time.

13:20.701 --> 13:22.633
You might say that.

13:22.668 --> 13:24.670
I mean,
i did try to run the
guy over with a car.

13:24.705 --> 13:25.836
Oh, yeah.

13:25.871 --> 13:27.272
Does that happen a lot?

13:27.307 --> 13:28.639
Does what happen a lot?

13:28.674 --> 13:30.276
You know,
your dad showing up
out of nowhere with

13:30.311 --> 13:31.477
a bunch of guys chasing him?

13:31.877 --> 13:33.479
Well, you never really know
what to expect with them.

13:33.514 --> 13:35.080
I mean, he has had
a pretty amazing life.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.647
Oh, no kidding.

13:36.682 --> 13:38.284
Not your average guy, huh?

13:38.319 --> 13:39.450
No.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.887
I mean, he's not
exactly what you'd
call a stay-home dad,

13:41.922 --> 13:43.489
but he's always
been there for me.

13:43.889 --> 13:45.055
Yeah.
I'm just saying that...

13:45.090 --> 13:47.092
i know exactly what you're
saying and you're wrong.

13:47.127 --> 13:50.696
Jesse,
my father wasn't exactly...

13:50.731 --> 13:51.862
brennan, please.

13:51.897 --> 13:53.499
Don't start this whole
your childhood/my childhood

13:53.899 --> 13:55.501
competition thing now, okay?

13:55.536 --> 13:56.719
Look, i gotta go.

13:56.754 --> 13:57.903
I got a date.

13:58.304 --> 13:59.470
I'll see you.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.507
Yeah,
be careful, huh?

14:17.923 --> 14:19.525
Noah?

14:23.529 --> 14:25.531
Noah.

14:29.134 --> 14:30.336
Dad.

14:30.736 --> 14:31.937
Get in the car.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.138
Where are you?

14:33.539 --> 14:35.941
Just get in the car.

14:36.342 --> 14:38.744
These guys aren't going
to take no for an answer.

14:38.779 --> 14:41.512
I'm not leaving without you.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.949
Well, that's
not going to happen.

14:57.963 --> 14:59.965
What are you waiting for?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.567
Go.

15:16.448 --> 15:18.415
What's this
place supposed to be?

15:18.450 --> 15:22.454
Well,
it's supposed to be
a new mutant safehouse.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.456
I'll explain later.

15:24.857 --> 15:25.658
Why don't
you go on down?

15:26.058 --> 15:27.259
Let me
patch you up.

15:27.294 --> 15:28.460
Oh, come on, jess.

15:28.495 --> 15:29.662
I'm fine.

15:30.062 --> 15:31.228
Yeah.

15:31.263 --> 15:32.464
You know, you're
just like your mom.

15:32.865 --> 15:34.066
You're always
trying to...

15:34.101 --> 15:35.267
take care
of things, you know.

15:35.668 --> 15:36.834
That's funny.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.470
She was always saying
i was just like you because

15:38.871 --> 15:40.072
i was always acting up.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.238
Sit.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.474
Guess i got a
foot in both camps, huh?

15:42.875 --> 15:44.276
Yeah.

15:44.311 --> 15:45.643
So...

15:45.678 --> 15:50.047
you want to tell me why
those guys were chasing you?

15:50.082 --> 15:52.484
Well, i was doing pretty
good at this job and then i got,

15:52.519 --> 15:54.486
uh, downsized.

15:54.887 --> 15:56.453
That's when i went to nexxogen.

15:56.488 --> 15:59.692
And i stumbled on this company
scandal involving new mutants.

15:59.727 --> 16:02.895
Have anything to do
with the martez accident?

16:02.930 --> 16:05.297
Well, what do
you know about that?

16:05.698 --> 16:07.700
Just what
was in the news.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.667
Ah,
it was all a cover-up.

16:09.702 --> 16:13.270
If the real truth came
out, heads would roll.

16:13.305 --> 16:17.309
Let me guess:
With your head first on
the chopping block, huh?

16:17.344 --> 16:19.311
<laughing>
you got that right.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.914
When i realised
what had happened,

16:21.949 --> 16:24.081
i knew that there
was no turning back.

16:24.116 --> 16:26.919
So i downloaded everything
about the incident

16:26.954 --> 16:28.921
- as insurance.

16:29.321 --> 16:30.923
Where's the file?

16:31.323 --> 16:33.290
I put it on a disk.

16:33.325 --> 16:36.128
Which i slipped in your
coat pocket last night.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.329
What?

16:37.730 --> 16:39.331
Well, i was afraid they
would take it away from me.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.134
Well, i knew they wouldn't
take it away from you.

16:42.534 --> 16:45.337
Glad you trust me, dad?

16:45.738 --> 16:46.939
Weli...

16:47.339 --> 16:50.943
in fact,
i have some pretty powerful
friends who i trust,

16:50.978 --> 16:52.544
who i think might
be able to help us.

16:52.945 --> 16:54.511
I can't let you do that.

16:54.546 --> 16:56.949
These people are willing
to kill at any cost
to keep this secret.

16:56.984 --> 16:58.515
Yeah. No,
you don't understand...

16:58.550 --> 17:00.552
i feel bad enough
drawing you into it.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.554
I don't want
to risk anyone else.

17:02.589 --> 17:06.558
We handle
this my way.

17:06.593 --> 17:09.361
All right, dad.

17:09.396 --> 17:10.963
Okay.

17:16.568 --> 17:18.569
All right.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.388
Okay.

17:20.424 --> 17:22.174
Ah.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.387
I knew i shouldn't
have worn these pants.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.790
My underwear is
riding up big time.

17:37.825 --> 17:38.991
You're wearing underwear?

17:39.391 --> 17:40.792
You're not?

17:40.827 --> 17:42.194
You two done?

17:42.229 --> 17:43.395
Yeah.

17:43.796 --> 17:44.997
I think that
about covers it.

17:46.598 --> 17:48.600
Now,
the computer centre shouldn't
be too far past the lobby.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.602
Once you've passed through
the employees' entrance,

17:50.637 --> 17:51.769
get there fast.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.806
Your id gives
you limited access.

17:53.841 --> 17:55.024
Shall we?

17:55.059 --> 17:56.208
Yeah.

18:26.638 --> 18:28.640
Just a moment.

18:38.650 --> 18:40.252
Is there a problem?

18:49.862 --> 18:51.829
Go ahead.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.866
No. No problem.

19:01.073 --> 19:02.639
It's under control, sir.

19:02.674 --> 19:05.477
Since you don't have the
disk, i'll have to assume that

19:05.512 --> 19:08.280
your definition of "control"
differs wildly from mine.

19:08.680 --> 19:11.083
The nexxogen employee
who stole the disk is
jesse kilmartin's father.

19:11.118 --> 19:13.503
And with a member
of mutantx involved,

19:13.538 --> 19:15.888
the playing field
is very different.

19:16.288 --> 19:18.490
Are you trying to shirk
responsibility for your failure?

19:18.525 --> 19:20.692
I'm simply pointing out how
complex the situation is.

19:21.093 --> 19:24.696
Mr. Porter,
i would like to make the
situation crystal clear.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.499
If that file gets
into the wrong hands,

19:27.534 --> 19:31.120
genomex could be
shut down permanently.

19:31.155 --> 19:34.706
I understand, sir,
but... no more excuses.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.708
There better not be.

19:47.119 --> 19:48.520
It's terrible, huh?

19:48.555 --> 19:50.239
No, it's great.

19:50.274 --> 19:51.889
I was starving.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.726
You know,
i think i may be getting too
old for this kind of work.

19:55.127 --> 19:56.328
Oh, shut up.

19:56.728 --> 19:58.730
You're not old and
you're going to be around
for a long time, dad.

19:58.765 --> 20:01.750
No, you may have to take
over for your old man, yeah?

20:01.785 --> 20:04.736
But, from what i hear,
it sounds like you already have.

20:05.137 --> 20:06.703
What do you mean?

20:06.738 --> 20:09.942
I know about
you and your "team".

20:09.977 --> 20:11.944
Mutant x?

20:12.344 --> 20:15.112
How?

20:15.147 --> 20:16.713
I got my sources.

20:16.748 --> 20:19.551
Hey, come on,
i've been in covert ops
my entire adult life.

20:19.586 --> 20:22.319
I know what's happening.

20:22.354 --> 20:25.958
Particularly where
it concerns my own son.

20:30.362 --> 20:33.931
I'm proud of you, jesse.

20:33.966 --> 20:36.368
It's great work you're doing.

20:36.768 --> 20:39.171
Thank you.

20:42.774 --> 20:44.341
Dad?

20:44.376 --> 20:45.577
No, i'm okay.

20:45.978 --> 20:47.144
You look beat.

20:47.179 --> 20:49.581
Look, why don't
you get some rest?

20:49.982 --> 20:52.384
I'll go get you some clean
clothes and some real food.

20:52.419 --> 20:53.986
No, i got some work to do.

20:54.386 --> 20:55.587
Well, i'll help you with
that when i get back, okay?

20:55.988 --> 20:57.189
What about the...

20:57.224 --> 20:58.390
i'll get the disk.

20:58.790 --> 20:59.556
Okay?

20:59.591 --> 21:00.757
Get some rest.

21:00.792 --> 21:01.994
There's a cot right there.

21:02.029 --> 21:03.595
I'll be back soon.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.182
You come to a decision?

21:25.217 --> 21:28.820
The price is non-negotiable.

21:28.855 --> 21:32.424
Besides,
i have protection now.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.391
You can't stop me.

21:34.426 --> 21:39.631
You step up with the cash or
i go public with the disk.

21:49.241 --> 21:50.407
Don't worry.

21:50.442 --> 21:52.044
I've got this covered.

21:58.450 --> 22:01.253
I need you two to scout
the outer perimeter.

22:01.288 --> 22:03.655
Get moving.

22:20.472 --> 22:22.874
Nicely done.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.476
Thanks.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.282
Ready?

22:30.317 --> 22:32.484
Yeah.

22:37.289 --> 22:40.092
Adam, the computers
are blocked by a laser grid.

22:40.127 --> 22:41.258
I know.

22:41.293 --> 22:42.894
We'll have to deactivate it.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.061
Look around.

22:44.096 --> 22:46.498
There should be an unprotected
keyboard somewhere.

22:51.703 --> 22:52.869
Okay.

22:52.904 --> 22:55.272
Okay, good.

22:55.307 --> 22:56.908
Now that you got the keyboard,

22:57.309 --> 22:59.311
we can start the
decryption for access.

23:03.315 --> 23:04.881
All right, good.

23:04.916 --> 23:10.122
Now, i want you to key
in this sequence: 6-9-6-2-4-1.

23:16.128 --> 23:17.729
That did it.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.702
Hold it right there.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.739
Why aren't you guarding
the computer centre?

23:27.774 --> 23:28.958
Miss carter...

23:28.993 --> 23:30.107
miss carter.

23:30.142 --> 23:31.743
We've got a breach.

23:31.778 --> 23:32.944
Where?

23:34.946 --> 23:36.548
Move.

23:47.759 --> 23:49.561
All right. Try that.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.363
Okay. Here we go.

23:54.966 --> 23:55.967
Adam?

23:56.002 --> 23:56.933
Yes.

23:56.968 --> 23:58.170
We're getting the feed.

23:58.570 --> 24:00.172
I'm assuming that you haven't
had any problems with security.

24:00.572 --> 24:01.738
No. It was pretty good.

24:01.773 --> 24:04.176
Emma had to get rid
of a couple of gs agents,

24:04.576 --> 24:05.777
but aside from that... wait.

24:05.812 --> 24:06.978
Gs agents?

24:07.013 --> 24:08.145
Yeah.

24:08.180 --> 24:09.381
All right, both of
you get out of there now.

24:10.582 --> 24:12.584
We're about
three minutes away from
a complete download.

24:12.619 --> 24:13.802
Yeah, but if eckhart's
men are there,

24:13.837 --> 24:14.986
they've changed
the security codes.

24:15.387 --> 24:16.588
They're going to know
we're tapped into the system.

24:16.988 --> 24:18.190
I want you both
out of there now.

24:18.225 --> 24:19.756
All right.

24:19.791 --> 24:22.194
I want you and jesse
to take the double helix,

24:22.229 --> 24:23.795
get over there, get them out.

24:23.830 --> 24:24.961
Okay.

24:24.996 --> 24:26.598
Only there's
one problem with that.

24:26.633 --> 24:27.816
Jesse left a while ago.

24:27.851 --> 24:29.000
Turned off his comlink.

24:29.401 --> 24:30.602
All right,
forget about jesse.

24:30.637 --> 24:31.803
You go get them.

24:33.405 --> 24:35.006
Hurry.

24:51.423 --> 24:53.825
Hold it.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.442
Come on.

25:48.079 --> 25:51.283
Somebody call for a ride?

26:00.492 --> 26:02.894
We are so screwed.

26:02.929 --> 26:05.297
Deactivate cloak.

26:07.299 --> 26:09.701
No, we're not.

26:27.319 --> 26:30.922
I knew eventually
saner minds would prevail.

26:30.957 --> 26:35.327
Are you prepared
to meet my price?

26:35.362 --> 26:36.893
Yes.

26:36.928 --> 26:39.731
I'm tired of dealing with
your new mutant friends.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.298
What?

26:41.333 --> 26:43.300
When i hired
you to head security,

26:43.335 --> 26:45.737
i never realised your extortion
skills were so refined.

26:46.137 --> 26:48.540
It'll take me at least a
day to put the funds together.

26:48.575 --> 26:50.942
Just call me when
you have the money.

27:22.574 --> 27:24.140
How'd you find me here?

27:24.175 --> 27:26.578
My cell phone's untraceable.

27:26.613 --> 27:28.144
Yes.

27:28.179 --> 27:30.582
But thanks to my specialty,
your voice isn't?

27:30.617 --> 27:32.601
Oh!

27:32.636 --> 27:34.551
Go.

27:34.586 --> 27:37.389
Find the disk.

27:52.604 --> 27:54.205
Jesse?

27:54.240 --> 27:55.772
Yeah.

27:55.807 --> 27:57.409
You heard
from your father?

27:57.809 --> 27:59.411
Yeah, actually, i just...

27:59.446 --> 28:01.012
just left him.

28:02.213 --> 28:03.415
I thought you were going
to let me know when he called.

28:03.815 --> 28:05.417
I'm sorry.

28:05.817 --> 28:06.983
It obviously just
slipped my mind.

28:07.018 --> 28:10.221
Well,
we could've used your help
getting emma and shalimar

28:10.256 --> 28:11.423
out of nexxogen.

28:11.458 --> 28:12.589
What?

28:12.624 --> 28:14.591
Yeah, they broke
into the databank.

28:14.626 --> 28:16.192
They found out why
they're after your father.

28:16.227 --> 28:18.229
Yeah, he stole a file with
the real story of martez.

28:18.264 --> 28:20.649
Afraid it goes a
little deeper than that.

28:20.684 --> 28:23.034
Turns out your father
stole the file to...

28:23.435 --> 28:27.439
blackmail nexxogen.

28:27.839 --> 28:29.841
What?

28:29.876 --> 28:31.460
Yeah.

28:31.495 --> 28:33.009
Sorry.

28:33.044 --> 28:34.646
I know it's hard to hear
something like this, but...

28:34.681 --> 28:36.212
look, my dad is
the good guy here.

28:36.247 --> 28:38.249
I mean,
obviously, they're
trying to frame him.

28:38.284 --> 28:39.816
I don't think so.

28:39.851 --> 28:41.418
Adam, we're talking
about my dad here.

28:41.453 --> 28:43.855
I think
i know him a little
better than you do.

28:43.890 --> 28:45.857
Jesse, just listen.

28:46.257 --> 28:47.424
I want you to
look at the evidence.

28:47.459 --> 28:49.861
You can see that, you know,
we're not just making this up.

28:52.263 --> 28:53.865
Jesse...

29:01.072 --> 29:03.039
he doesn't have the disk.

29:03.074 --> 29:05.041
And refuses to
tell us where it is.

29:05.076 --> 29:11.082
So, mr. Kilmartin, you're
as big a pain as your son.

29:11.117 --> 29:15.487
Perhaps i should turn
you over to miss carter.

29:15.522 --> 29:18.289
She lacks my
tolerance and patience.

29:18.690 --> 29:20.256
Don't threaten me.

29:20.291 --> 29:25.497
I know full well
that nexxogen is just
a puppet of genomex.

29:25.532 --> 29:28.317
It's impossible to prove.

29:28.352 --> 29:31.067
<laughing>
don't bet on it.

29:31.102 --> 29:33.104
How do you think
the world would react
if they knew what

29:33.139 --> 29:34.671
happened at martez?

29:34.706 --> 29:36.708
It was an
industrial accident.

29:36.743 --> 29:38.274
It was new mutants.

29:38.309 --> 29:43.114
And because of
the experiments nexxogen
performed at your behest,

29:43.515 --> 29:47.519
their genes replicated
out of control until their

29:47.919 --> 29:51.523
bodies simply exploded.

29:51.923 --> 29:55.527
Of course, the file goes
into more graphic detail.

30:03.134 --> 30:06.337
My apologies at your rude
reception, mr. Kilmartin.

30:23.555 --> 30:25.156
Dad?

30:26.758 --> 30:27.959
Dad?!

30:30.361 --> 30:31.563
Dad?!

30:49.547 --> 30:51.149
I tried to talk to him,
but he wouldn't hear it.

30:51.184 --> 30:52.350
So you have
no idea where he went?

30:52.385 --> 30:53.516
No.

30:53.551 --> 30:54.752
Why can't
he just face it?

30:55.153 --> 30:56.354
His father's not the good
guy that he pretends to be.

30:56.754 --> 30:58.356
Yeah, well, it' a little
more complex than that.

30:58.391 --> 30:59.522
What's complex?

30:59.557 --> 31:01.159
All the evidence is
there in black and white.

31:01.559 --> 31:03.161
Yeah, well, it's not
black and white to jesse.

31:03.196 --> 31:04.362
Hey, don't get mad at me.

31:04.397 --> 31:05.563
I'm not. I just...

31:06.764 --> 31:09.167
shalimar, look, i know that
you and jesse are close, but...

31:10.768 --> 31:12.370
he just wants
to believe that he grew
up with the perfect father.

31:12.405 --> 31:13.571
Yeah, well, i'll talk
to him when he gets back.

31:13.972 --> 31:15.138
No, you won't.

31:15.173 --> 31:16.774
Can't we just give him
some time to absorb this?

31:17.175 --> 31:18.376
No. We don't have time.

31:18.776 --> 31:20.378
Every minute that that disk
is out there we run the risk of

31:20.413 --> 31:21.945
the world finding
out what happened in martez.

31:21.980 --> 31:24.782
And if that happens, then
new mutants are exposed and our

31:24.817 --> 31:27.585
life and our cause becomes
that much more complicated.

31:35.193 --> 31:37.996
Mason, there's been another
security breach at nexxogen.

31:38.031 --> 31:39.562
Yes.

31:39.597 --> 31:42.000
I heard they'd installed a
revolving door at your facility.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.002
Don't try to
pin the blame on me.

31:44.037 --> 31:45.203
It was more new mutants,

31:45.603 --> 31:47.605
and your gs agents
were of no help whatsoever.

31:48.006 --> 31:49.172
They'll be disciplined.

31:49.207 --> 31:52.410
Are you any closer
to retrieving the disk?

31:52.445 --> 31:54.012
I'm going to pay him off.

31:54.412 --> 31:55.613
Really?

31:56.014 --> 31:57.580
I'm putting the
funds together now.

31:57.615 --> 31:59.217
But i hate to disappoint
you, miss carter.

31:59.617 --> 32:01.219
But you're a day
late and a dollar short.

32:01.619 --> 32:03.586
The deal's off.

32:03.621 --> 32:06.824
But thanks so much for
helping to drive the price up.

32:07.225 --> 32:09.627
Eckhart,
that disk is mine.

32:10.028 --> 32:11.194
It was.

32:11.229 --> 32:14.032
But perhaps it will be a
tad safer in my possession.

32:17.635 --> 32:22.440
So, mr. Kilmartin,
where exactly is the disk?

32:22.840 --> 32:24.807
You'll have it soon enough.

32:24.842 --> 32:28.046
Now, how do you propose we
conclude our transaction?

32:28.081 --> 32:30.813
I've thought that through.

32:30.848 --> 32:34.052
Somehow, i had
a feeling you might.

32:43.661 --> 32:45.263
Jesse,
where have you been?

32:45.663 --> 32:47.265
Adam's been trying
to find you all night.

32:47.300 --> 32:48.431
Why?

32:48.466 --> 32:49.867
Did he find some
more dirt on my dad?

32:49.902 --> 32:51.269
Look, adam's not
the bad guy in all this.

32:51.304 --> 32:53.271
But my dad is.

32:53.671 --> 32:54.872
I'm not saying that.

32:54.907 --> 32:56.074
Yeah, you are.

32:56.109 --> 32:57.240
Jess...

32:57.275 --> 32:59.242
you're just like
everybody else, aren't you?

32:59.277 --> 33:01.644
Look, jesse, i know you
love your dad, but you...

33:01.679 --> 33:05.282
oh, c'mon,
you can't ignore what is
right in front of you.

33:05.317 --> 33:08.886
Do you know
what it's like to see
your dad being shot at?

33:08.921 --> 33:12.490
Or found and beat to a pulp?

33:12.525 --> 33:16.459
No. No.

33:16.494 --> 33:21.699
Well,
i thought that, of everybody,
you'd be on my side.

33:33.711 --> 33:36.113
Hold on.

33:36.148 --> 33:38.481
Dad.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.118
Thank god, jesse.

33:40.153 --> 33:41.319
Dad.

33:41.719 --> 33:42.920
Look, we got a bunch
of documents from nexxogen

33:43.321 --> 33:44.887
that make it look like...

33:44.922 --> 33:46.524
well, they make it look
like you're an extortionist.

33:46.559 --> 33:48.126
They're trying to
frame me, you know that.

33:48.161 --> 33:50.093
What happened at the safe house?

33:50.128 --> 33:52.130
A pack of gs
agents tracked me down.

33:52.530 --> 33:54.132
I... managed to get away.

33:54.167 --> 33:55.333
Are you all right?

33:55.368 --> 33:56.499
For now.

33:56.534 --> 33:58.536
I want you to listen
carefully to me, jesse.

33:58.936 --> 34:02.140
I need you to take the
disk back to the safehouse.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.542
I want you to leave
it in the first aid kit

34:04.577 --> 34:05.961
and then get out of there.

34:05.996 --> 34:07.345
Why don't i meet you there?

34:07.745 --> 34:09.347
Because i don't want
anything to happen to you.

34:09.382 --> 34:11.349
Now, do as i say, jesse.

34:11.748 --> 34:13.751
My life is at stake.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.956
You lie beautifully,
mr. Kilmartin.

34:18.991 --> 34:21.324
Well,
i'm not lying about this.

34:21.359 --> 34:25.763
If anything happens to
my son, the deal's off.

34:26.164 --> 34:30.168
Your loyalty is
something to behold.

34:34.172 --> 34:36.139
Mr. Kilmartin will
take you to the disk.

34:36.174 --> 34:38.976
Once you have it, i'll
wire the money we agreed on.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.157
Mr. Porter...

34:54.192 --> 34:57.395
once you have
that disk, kill him.

35:05.803 --> 35:07.004
Maybe i should
try talking to him.

35:07.405 --> 35:08.571
Oh, shalimar tried.

35:08.606 --> 35:09.807
He said he just
wants to be left alone.

35:09.842 --> 35:11.374
Well,
shouldn't we try again?

35:11.409 --> 35:13.010
Might end up driving
him farther away,

35:13.045 --> 35:14.612
instead of helping
him face the truth.

35:15.012 --> 35:18.616
Adam, jesse just took
off in the double helix.

35:31.429 --> 35:33.030
Jesse?

35:41.038 --> 35:42.439
Jesse.

35:42.474 --> 35:43.841
Yes.

35:44.242 --> 35:45.408
Where are you going?

35:45.443 --> 35:47.845
I'm going to give my dad the
disk on the martez incident.

35:48.246 --> 35:49.412
What?

35:49.447 --> 35:51.048
Why didn't you
tell us you had the disk?

35:51.083 --> 35:51.849
I couldn't.

35:51.884 --> 35:53.015
I...

35:53.050 --> 35:54.652
jesse,
we're all on your side.

35:54.687 --> 35:55.818
All right, jesse, look.

35:55.853 --> 35:57.855
I know this isn't easy,
but your dad is not the guy

35:57.890 --> 35:59.422
he pretends to be.

35:59.457 --> 36:01.023
You have to believe us.

36:01.058 --> 36:03.461
Look, i just don't know
what to believe right now.

36:03.496 --> 36:05.428
Jesse, just come back.

36:05.463 --> 36:07.865
C'mon, can't we
can't talk about this?

36:16.274 --> 36:18.075
Jesse?

36:18.110 --> 36:19.877
Off.

36:38.362 --> 36:40.730
Where the hell is it?

36:40.765 --> 36:44.734
It was
supposed to be here.

36:44.769 --> 36:47.572
I don't know
what happened to it.

36:47.607 --> 36:49.791
I do.

36:49.826 --> 36:51.941
Finally.

36:51.976 --> 36:54.378
You were supposed
to bring the disk
here and then leave.

36:54.413 --> 36:55.980
Yeah. I lied.

36:56.380 --> 36:58.382
You know,
like you did, about giving
these guys the slip.

36:58.417 --> 37:01.185
Jesse, give me the disk.

37:01.586 --> 37:04.789
Everybody told me
what was happening.

37:04.824 --> 37:07.992
I guess i had to see
it for myself, huh?

37:10.795 --> 37:11.961
Hold it right there, champ.

37:11.996 --> 37:13.998
Hand over that disk
or become an instant orphan.

37:14.033 --> 37:15.199
Oh, go ahead.

37:15.234 --> 37:16.365
What?

37:16.400 --> 37:18.402
Well, you've been using
me all along, go ahead.

37:18.437 --> 37:20.004
It's no loss.

37:43.227 --> 37:45.229
No. No, don't shoot.

37:45.264 --> 37:46.395
Don't.

37:46.430 --> 37:54.038
Argh! Argh! Argh! Argh!

38:19.263 --> 38:20.864
You followed me.

38:20.899 --> 38:22.466
You got that right.

38:22.867 --> 38:24.468
I always got your back.

38:24.503 --> 38:26.070
Thank you.

38:26.105 --> 38:27.672
Yeah.

38:33.678 --> 38:35.279
Jesse?

38:42.086 --> 38:43.653
You know, dad.

38:43.688 --> 38:45.690
I hate to break it to you,
but the moment they had their

38:45.725 --> 38:47.291
hands on that
disk you were dead.

38:47.692 --> 38:51.696
Look, all i ever wanted was
a chance to start over again.

38:51.731 --> 38:55.700
I didn't mean to hurt you,
jesse, but i had no choice.

38:56.100 --> 38:58.067
No choice.

38:58.102 --> 39:00.104
You know,
you always got choices, dad.

39:00.504 --> 39:02.471
You just made the wrong one.

39:02.506 --> 39:05.710
My life wasn't going
the way i wanted it to.

39:06.110 --> 39:08.913
I wanted to provide
for you and...

39:09.313 --> 39:10.479
don't.

39:10.514 --> 39:12.516
Okay? Just... just don't.

39:20.124 --> 39:22.526
Do you have the disk?

39:40.945 --> 39:44.148
Why couldn't you have just
come back for me, huh?

39:44.183 --> 39:48.970
Look, i know the kind
of father you want.

39:49.005 --> 39:53.758
And i'm sorry
- but i'm not that guy.

39:53.793 --> 39:56.961
Yeah. I'm sorry, too.

40:14.979 --> 40:18.983
Your gs agents have blocked me
from entering my own facility.

40:19.383 --> 40:21.385
It's not your
facility anymore.

40:21.786 --> 40:24.188
I've convinced the federal
government to allow genomex

40:24.223 --> 40:26.555
to take over nexxogen.

40:26.590 --> 40:28.192
Well,
i certainly couldn't keep
letting people just run in

40:28.227 --> 40:29.759
there and take
anything they wanted.

40:29.794 --> 40:31.395
I've ordered a complete
overhaul of the database.

40:31.430 --> 40:33.362
As far as
the disk is concerned,

40:33.397 --> 40:34.999
you'll be happy to
know it's been destroyed.

40:35.399 --> 40:36.600
What am i going to do?

40:37.001 --> 40:39.403
Well,
we have some wonderful
job opportunities

40:39.438 --> 40:43.372
on the genomex website.

40:43.407 --> 40:47.411
Of course, we require
excellent references.

40:57.421 --> 40:59.824
And as for you, mr. Porter...

41:05.429 --> 41:09.033
you'll be listening
to me for a long time.

41:26.650 --> 41:28.617
Jesse?

41:28.652 --> 41:30.654
I heard what happened.

41:31.055 --> 41:33.457
You okay?

41:33.858 --> 41:35.424
Yeah, i'm fine.

41:35.459 --> 41:38.662
You want to
talk about it?

41:38.697 --> 41:41.430
No.

41:41.465 --> 41:46.270
Do you want me
to leave you alone?

41:46.305 --> 41:49.473
No.
