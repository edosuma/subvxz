00:04.900 --> 00:07.420
REPORTER: The fire at this
NYPD evidence warehouse

00:07.620 --> 00:09.520
began in the early
morning hours.

00:09.720 --> 00:11.660
The Queens facility houses
evidence critical

00:11.860 --> 00:13.790
to both current and past cases.

00:13.990 --> 00:15.490
While the cause
of the blaze is under

00:15.690 --> 00:17.960
investigation, it's clear this

00:18.160 --> 00:19.470
represents a massive blow...

00:19.670 --> 00:21.900
Hell of a mess.
Phones haven't stopped ringing.

00:22.100 --> 00:23.740
It's every detective
in the city calling to see

00:23.940 --> 00:26.270
if their perp just scored
a "get out of jail free" card.

00:26.470 --> 00:27.840
I just hope none of the evidence

00:28.040 --> 00:30.040
from our cases was stored
in that facility.

00:30.240 --> 00:32.710
Well, right now there's one case
at the top of that list.

00:32.910 --> 00:34.900
Come on.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.380
This is a developing story.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.320
I just got a call
from the federal prosecutors

00:40.520 --> 00:42.290
on the Zaragozas' case.

00:42.490 --> 00:43.660
Sounds like bad news.

00:43.860 --> 00:45.590
The DNA evidence
linking Diego Rodriguez

00:45.790 --> 00:47.490
to those 7 Ace Double Trey
homicides?

00:47.690 --> 00:49.460
Destroyed in that fire.

00:49.660 --> 00:50.960
But it was
already tested, right?

00:51.160 --> 00:52.630
No, the lab screwed up.
They never tested it.

00:52.830 --> 00:54.300
They never even
ordered the test.

00:54.500 --> 00:55.730
Without that evidence...

00:55.930 --> 00:57.270
The head of the Zaragoza cartel

00:57.470 --> 00:58.900
could go free.
Yeah.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.670
So, what's the game plan?

01:00.870 --> 01:02.940
We got to find some way
to connect Rodriguez

01:03.140 --> 01:04.460
to those murders.

01:09.130 --> 01:11.970
(indistinct chatter)

01:13.870 --> 01:15.420
Hey.

01:15.620 --> 01:16.860
Abetemarco.

01:17.060 --> 01:18.460
You guys come up with anything
on the canvas?

01:18.660 --> 01:20.130
No one saw
the suspect exit the store.

01:20.330 --> 01:23.000
A name perp committed
a robbery here last week.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.230
Yeah, Freddie James.

01:24.430 --> 01:25.760
We already questioned him
at the squad.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.400
And?
Don't have enough to hold him.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.540
I'm telling you, he's your guy.

01:30.740 --> 01:32.570
Leave your number.
I'll keep you posted.

01:32.770 --> 01:34.370
I appreciate it, pal, thanks.

01:34.570 --> 01:36.530
No problem.

01:38.790 --> 01:41.180
Freddie James, get your hand
out of your pocket.

01:41.380 --> 01:42.780
I already talked to the cops.

01:42.980 --> 01:45.150
You got some pair of balls
hanging out around here.

01:45.350 --> 01:46.890
I had nothing to do
with that guy getting killed.

01:47.090 --> 01:48.420
You're a damn liar.

01:48.620 --> 01:50.440
Arrest me, then.

01:51.440 --> 01:52.630
Now get the hell out of here.

01:52.830 --> 01:55.610
Didn't think so.
Yeah, beat it. Now.

01:58.310 --> 02:01.030
CROWD:
No justice, no peace!

02:01.230 --> 02:03.400
No justice, no peace!

02:03.600 --> 02:05.370
No justice,
no peace!

02:05.570 --> 02:07.310
No justice, no peace!

02:07.510 --> 02:09.210
(clamoring continuing)

02:09.410 --> 02:11.340
Hey.
Hey, let it go.

02:11.540 --> 02:12.710
OFFICER:
Guy chucked a
bottle at me.

02:12.910 --> 02:14.680
Are you kidding me?
Anti-cop protesters

02:14.880 --> 02:17.150
are always looking
to provoke a fight.

02:17.350 --> 02:19.150
Orders are

02:19.350 --> 02:20.520
to avoid one.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.260
Yeah!
(clamoring continues)

02:22.460 --> 02:23.490
I'm gonna head back to my post.

02:23.690 --> 02:27.030
CROWD:
No justice, no peace!

02:27.230 --> 02:28.160
No justice, no peace!

02:28.360 --> 02:29.760
You better keep walking.

02:29.960 --> 02:31.430
What are you gonna
do, shoot me?

02:31.630 --> 02:33.130
I told you to take a...

02:33.330 --> 02:34.670
All right, all right, okay,
that's it, you're under arrest.

02:34.870 --> 02:36.600
Hey! Get off me!
Okay.

02:36.800 --> 02:37.840
Hands behind your back.
Ow!

02:38.040 --> 02:39.270
(screaming)

02:39.470 --> 02:41.610
She's assaulting me!

02:41.810 --> 02:44.680
I need a bus at 15th
and Union Square West.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.850
(crying)

02:47.050 --> 02:48.830
(indistinct chatter)

02:53.740 --> 02:55.050
Fire Marshal Chieco?

02:55.250 --> 02:57.490
Take a number.
Sergeant Reagan, Intel Division.

02:57.690 --> 02:59.190
I'm coordinating
the NYPD investigation

02:59.390 --> 03:00.560
into the cause of the fire.

03:00.760 --> 03:01.890
Uh-huh.
Wanted to let you know

03:02.090 --> 03:03.930
I look forward to partnering
with you on this.

03:04.130 --> 03:06.050
Excuse me, Chief.

03:09.350 --> 03:11.000
Look, Reagan.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.470
Arson investigations
are FDNY turf.

03:13.670 --> 03:15.470
We've got the experience
and the expertise.

03:15.670 --> 03:16.810
I respect that.
Details will be

03:17.010 --> 03:19.250
shared with the NYPD
Arson/Explosion Team

03:19.450 --> 03:21.480
on a need-to-know-basis.

03:21.680 --> 03:23.380
Here's what you need
to know, Marshal.

03:23.580 --> 03:25.450
All the evidence collected
at this site

03:25.650 --> 03:27.690
by the FDNY will be processed

03:27.890 --> 03:29.960
at the NYPD crime lab.
Meaning?

03:30.160 --> 03:31.490
Meaning the FDNY
will receive exactly

03:31.690 --> 03:32.890
the cooperation it provides.

03:33.090 --> 03:34.630
I don't appreciate
your tactics, Sergeant.

03:34.830 --> 03:36.430
This isn't
about tactics.

03:36.630 --> 03:38.400
This is about the decades
of NYPD blood,

03:38.600 --> 03:41.050
sweat and tears mixed in with
the ashes of this warehouse.

03:42.350 --> 03:45.250
I intend to find out
what happened here.

03:47.260 --> 03:48.910
A joint investigation.

03:49.110 --> 03:51.490
I look forward
to working with you.

03:52.660 --> 03:55.150
Anti-cop rally
in Union Square

03:55.350 --> 03:56.920
this morning.
You're looking

03:57.120 --> 03:58.620
at Officer Edit Janko's
body cam.

03:58.820 --> 04:00.550
GORMLEY:
Look clean to me, boss.

04:00.750 --> 04:02.190
He says predictably.

04:02.390 --> 04:03.790
The protester's in the ER

04:03.990 --> 04:05.620
complaining
of a resulting neck injury.

04:05.820 --> 04:08.430
Flopping like one of them
World Cup soccer players.

04:08.630 --> 04:10.230
Dozens of cell phones caught it.

04:10.430 --> 04:11.860
All the outlets have it.

04:12.060 --> 04:15.230
Including the moments before
her body cam was activated?

04:15.430 --> 04:16.540
That I don't know.

04:16.740 --> 04:18.370
Well, that's what's
gonna tell the tale.

04:18.570 --> 04:20.040
Come on, guys.
Come on, what, Sid?

04:20.240 --> 04:23.440
When do we take a stand
and say enough?

04:23.640 --> 04:25.640
Enough of every cop
is just

04:25.840 --> 04:27.450
a short fuse waiting to be lit?

04:27.650 --> 04:29.080
I hear you, Sid, but you got...

04:29.280 --> 04:30.550
I know, I know,
I'm a broken record.

04:30.750 --> 04:32.550
But, come on, Eddie Janko?

04:32.750 --> 04:34.790
I mean,
where do we draw the line?

04:34.990 --> 04:36.920
Not our line to draw, Sid.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.790
Are you suggesting she be pulled
from active duty?

04:38.990 --> 04:41.690
No.
The evidence is inconclusive.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.830
Even by the harshest light.

04:44.030 --> 04:46.830
Officer Janko should
remain on full duty.

04:47.030 --> 04:49.650
I have Officer Janko, sir.

04:52.690 --> 04:54.920
You do?

04:57.190 --> 04:59.190
Okay.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.730
We'll give you the room.
Hold on a minute.

05:12.930 --> 05:15.230
Do we need the room?

05:15.430 --> 05:18.330
That's up to you, sir.
It's your room.

05:18.530 --> 05:20.580
They'll stay.

05:21.580 --> 05:23.150
Well, please.

05:27.790 --> 05:30.110
So, we've been talking
about you.

05:30.310 --> 05:32.810
Yeah, I wanted to discuss
the incident at the protest.

05:33.010 --> 05:35.010
Yeah, we just did.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.750
I'm sure there's, uh, pressure

05:36.950 --> 05:38.980
to place me on modified duty.

05:39.180 --> 05:41.140
Well...

05:42.570 --> 05:45.070
I should be modified.

05:47.840 --> 05:50.180
I have to be, for all our good.

05:52.050 --> 05:54.430
Did you use excessive force?

05:54.630 --> 05:56.030
No, sir.

05:56.230 --> 05:58.900
Have you lost faith
in our ability

05:59.100 --> 06:01.640
to conduct a fair investigation?

06:01.840 --> 06:02.780
Not at all.

06:02.980 --> 06:04.680
Then I'm at a loss here,
Officer.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.750
If I stay on full duty, it'll
prove I have a hook in One PP.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.350
And I don't want that.

06:09.550 --> 06:11.650
That decision lies with the PC.

06:11.850 --> 06:13.390
And I've made mine.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.870
May I speak freely?

06:16.670 --> 06:18.240
Haven't you been?

06:19.170 --> 06:21.790
You go out of your way
not to show favoritism

06:21.990 --> 06:23.660
to anyone in the family.

06:23.860 --> 06:26.000
Well, I try.

06:26.200 --> 06:27.900
Perception
out there's different.

06:28.100 --> 06:29.800
Well, I can't worry about that.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.040
But I <i>have</i> to.

06:31.240 --> 06:33.040
Being your family
plays like

06:33.240 --> 06:35.740
a leg up and a free pass
to the vast majority of cops.

06:35.940 --> 06:37.710
Who don't know you
and don't know me.

06:37.910 --> 06:39.280
And they never will.

06:39.480 --> 06:41.180
Look.

06:41.380 --> 06:43.480
I don't give my family
special treatment.

06:43.680 --> 06:46.950
But I also don't subject 'em
to special condemnation.

06:47.150 --> 06:48.890
I know you wouldn't
keep me on patrol

06:49.090 --> 06:51.360
if you didn't think
it was the right thing to do.

06:51.560 --> 06:52.560
Yeah, so what's going on here?

06:52.760 --> 06:54.360
I'm protecting my reputation.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.360
I have to err
on the side of caution here.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.000
Even if that means
I'm gonna ride a desk

06:58.200 --> 07:00.470
until this whole thing
blows over.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.220
That's the price.

07:12.330 --> 07:13.400
(door opens)

07:15.300 --> 07:16.330
(door closes)

07:17.330 --> 07:19.100
I don't know.

07:20.900 --> 07:24.170
* *

07:46.190 --> 07:48.750
I appreciate you
coming, Detective.

07:48.950 --> 07:51.280
Guess bad news
travels fast, huh?

07:51.480 --> 07:54.050
I assumed you'd be more
careful with your evidence.

07:54.250 --> 07:55.590
Me, too.

07:55.790 --> 07:57.120
Look, if you asked me here

07:57.320 --> 07:59.290
to rub my nose in it,
I got stuff to do.

07:59.490 --> 08:00.860
Quite the opposite.

08:01.060 --> 08:02.830
I wanted to apologize.

08:03.030 --> 08:04.160
Come again?

08:04.360 --> 08:06.060
Things got very personal
between us.

08:06.260 --> 08:08.530
The threat to your sons' lives?

08:08.730 --> 08:10.440
I had nothing
to do with that.

08:10.640 --> 08:13.440
Hmm, well,
you're a real saint, thanks.

08:13.640 --> 08:14.540
I'm a businessman.

08:14.740 --> 08:16.010
No, you're a drug dealer.

08:16.210 --> 08:18.110
And you murder anyone
who gets in your way.

08:18.310 --> 08:20.010
Those gang members who died...

08:20.210 --> 08:22.450
Who were executed
under your orders.

08:22.650 --> 08:24.150
...they all had
long criminal records.

08:24.350 --> 08:25.780
Violent men.

08:25.980 --> 08:28.350
We both know the world's
a lot safer without them.

08:28.550 --> 08:29.920
Well, what about
all the innocent people who die

08:30.120 --> 08:31.360
from your poison?

08:31.560 --> 08:33.490
Is the world a lot safer
without them?

08:33.690 --> 08:35.360
I make a clean product.

08:35.560 --> 08:38.860
If my distributors alter it
to increase their profits,

08:39.060 --> 08:41.730
they suffer the consequences.

08:41.930 --> 08:43.840
Right, like the ADTs.

08:44.040 --> 08:45.700
Well...
(laughs)

08:45.900 --> 08:47.910
I was speaking hypothetically.
Look,

08:48.110 --> 08:49.440
if you got something to say,
just say it.

08:49.640 --> 08:50.440
I got work to do.

08:50.640 --> 08:51.740
Like keeping me in prison?

08:51.940 --> 08:52.810
You're damn right.

08:53.010 --> 08:54.150
I respect your determination,

08:54.350 --> 08:55.310
Detective.

08:55.510 --> 08:56.310
You know,

08:56.510 --> 08:58.550
you remind me a lot of myself.

08:58.750 --> 09:00.190
I'm nothing like you.

09:00.390 --> 09:01.850
You didn't threaten
the lives of my daughters

09:02.050 --> 09:03.490
to get what you wanted?

09:03.690 --> 09:05.790
But that's in the past.

09:05.990 --> 09:09.360
Like your case against me.

09:09.560 --> 09:11.150
A word of advice.

09:12.450 --> 09:14.850
Let it go.

09:16.520 --> 09:18.850
<i>¿Me entiendes?</i>

09:23.560 --> 09:25.780
(lock buzzes)

09:25.980 --> 09:27.810
(latch clicks)
GUARD: Let's go.

09:28.010 --> 09:30.200
(indistinct chatter)

09:32.640 --> 09:34.150
There you are.

09:34.350 --> 09:36.620
Do you have the list
of salvageable cases?

09:36.820 --> 09:38.690
I'm working on it.

09:38.890 --> 09:40.490
What's, what's wrong?

09:40.690 --> 09:42.490
Remember Matthew Lassiter?

09:42.700 --> 09:45.260
The guy that you helped
with his dispensary license?

09:45.460 --> 09:46.530
Yeah.

09:46.730 --> 09:48.800
I stopped by to see him
this morning.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.700
Okay, and how is he?

09:50.900 --> 09:52.340
He's dead.

09:52.540 --> 09:53.810
What?

09:54.010 --> 09:55.170
He got shot in his store.

09:55.370 --> 09:56.740
Oh, my God. What happened?

09:56.940 --> 09:59.080
Must have been the same prick
that robbed him last week

09:59.280 --> 10:00.850
making sure
Matthew couldn't ID him.

10:01.050 --> 10:02.250
Any surveillance video?

10:02.450 --> 10:05.380
Kept his back to the camera.
Witnesses?

10:05.580 --> 10:07.190
Customer in the shop says
she didn't see the shooter.

10:07.390 --> 10:09.920
And believe me,
you would remember him.

10:10.120 --> 10:11.560
Freddie James.

10:11.760 --> 10:14.930
He's been terrorizing that
neighborhood for a month.

10:15.130 --> 10:18.050
Well... I'm sure
the cops will catch him.

10:18.850 --> 10:22.130
All the same, I'd like a little
time to help make this right.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.040
Anthony, we're in crisis
right now.

10:24.240 --> 10:25.800
Every hour that goes by,
more defendants

10:26.000 --> 10:27.240
are gonna be released.

10:27.440 --> 10:29.470
Look, this guy lost
three years of his life

10:29.670 --> 10:32.340
in jail for something
that is legal now.

10:32.540 --> 10:34.250
And then he
took a bullet

10:34.450 --> 10:35.810
for trying to make
an honest living?

10:36.010 --> 10:38.230
I just can't let this go.

10:40.070 --> 10:42.790
Okay, catch him fast.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.890
Thanks, I owe you one.
Yeah.

10:45.090 --> 10:47.240
I'll put it on your tab.

10:49.010 --> 10:51.130
Martin Hughes?

10:51.330 --> 10:52.830
I'm Sergeant Reagan.

10:53.030 --> 10:54.800
That didn't take long.
I'm sorry?

10:55.000 --> 10:56.700
Got to blame
this fire on someone.

10:56.900 --> 10:58.400
Why not
the warehouse supervisor?

10:58.600 --> 11:00.410
I just want to ask
some questions.
Save you the trouble.

11:00.610 --> 11:02.240
This was a disaster
waiting to happen.

11:02.440 --> 11:04.110
I kept asking
for the resources to make

11:04.310 --> 11:06.210
this place safe,
the answer was always no.

11:06.410 --> 11:08.350
If you know
how the fire started...

11:08.550 --> 11:09.880
I'm done talking.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.850
I'm not gonna give them
any more rope to hang me with.

11:12.050 --> 11:13.450
I'd like to talk to your staff.

11:13.650 --> 11:15.640
Free country.

11:19.070 --> 11:20.460
(sighs)

11:20.660 --> 11:22.700
He was like that
before the fire, too.

11:22.900 --> 11:23.960
I'm Sergeant Reagan.

11:24.160 --> 11:26.060
Bradley Loomis. I work
the night shift.

11:26.260 --> 11:28.370
Or, at least, I did.

11:28.570 --> 11:30.640
Were you in the warehouse
when the fire started?
Yeah.

11:30.840 --> 11:33.410
The flames were everywhere.
I barely made it out.

11:33.610 --> 11:34.470
You were lucky.

11:34.670 --> 11:36.570
Did the sprinkler
systems engage?

11:36.780 --> 11:39.110
No. So, Martin's
right about the warehouse

11:39.310 --> 11:40.280
needing major upgrades.

11:40.480 --> 11:41.380
And did you see
anything suspicious

11:41.580 --> 11:43.180
in the hours
before the fire?

11:43.380 --> 11:45.150
I've gone over it in my mind.

11:45.350 --> 11:46.520
It was just a normal night.

11:46.720 --> 11:50.070
Okay. Well, um, if you
recall anything...

11:51.370 --> 11:53.160
I've worked in this
place for 22 years.

11:53.360 --> 11:57.360
Protecting this evidence,
it meant everything to me.

11:57.560 --> 11:59.650
We're gonna find who did this.

12:04.090 --> 12:06.070
MAN:
Did you get that money
I sent you last week?

12:06.270 --> 12:08.040
WOMAN:
Yeah, I got it.

12:08.240 --> 12:10.040
MAN: Okay.
WOMAN: I appreciate it.

12:10.240 --> 12:11.680
You Moses?

12:11.880 --> 12:13.630
Sit down.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.330
Appreciate you seeing me.

12:17.300 --> 12:19.150
Most cops don't call ahead.

12:19.350 --> 12:20.650
They just break the door down.

12:20.850 --> 12:22.790
My guys'll do that if
you try anything funny

12:22.990 --> 12:23.820
while I'm in here.

12:24.020 --> 12:24.920
I'll cut
to the chase...

12:25.120 --> 12:26.390
I know why you're here.

12:26.590 --> 12:27.530
You do?

12:27.730 --> 12:29.390
Diego Rodriguez
is about to walk,

12:29.590 --> 12:31.600
and you need me to help
you keep him in prison.

12:31.800 --> 12:34.300
We saw him walk in here
the day before

12:34.500 --> 12:36.400
seven of your men were executed.

12:36.600 --> 12:37.900
We had business.

12:38.100 --> 12:40.140
He make any threatening
statements during that business?

12:40.340 --> 12:41.770
If he did,

12:41.970 --> 12:43.940
I wouldn't tell you.

12:44.140 --> 12:47.500
Seven ADTs were executed
on your watch.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.980
You give up Rodriguez,
you even the score.

12:51.180 --> 12:54.090
You think the Zaragozas
would make a move like that

12:54.290 --> 12:56.300
on their own and start a war?

12:58.110 --> 12:59.790
You're saying you
okayed the execution

12:59.990 --> 13:01.390
of seven of your own men?

13:01.590 --> 13:04.360
I'm saying there are rules
to our business with the cartel.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.500
Yeah, I know.
No cutting the product.

13:06.700 --> 13:09.970
Those who broke the rules
paid the price.

13:10.170 --> 13:12.550
And you stay in business
with the cartel.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.660
Thanks for your time.

13:19.630 --> 13:20.850
You won't draft
an arrest warrant

13:21.050 --> 13:22.350
for Freddie James?

13:22.550 --> 13:24.450
I read the report.
There's not enough evidence

13:24.650 --> 13:26.650
to arrest him for
killing Matthew Lassiter.

13:26.850 --> 13:28.090
That's why
I need the warrant.

13:28.290 --> 13:29.450
Couple hours
in the box

13:29.650 --> 13:31.490
with this guy,
and he'll confess.

13:31.690 --> 13:33.330
With or without a rubber hose?

13:33.530 --> 13:35.260
James had motive
to kill Matthew.

13:35.460 --> 13:38.400
Motive alone is not enough,
and you know it.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.560
Find something solid,

13:39.760 --> 13:41.170
and I will seek
an arrest warrant.

13:41.370 --> 13:42.900
Until then, I need you
back in the office.

13:43.100 --> 13:44.040
I need some more time.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.270
Anthony, we are

13:45.470 --> 13:46.640
hemorrhaging prosecutions here.

13:46.840 --> 13:49.810
Listen, this prick killed
Matthew Lassiter,

13:50.010 --> 13:52.710
and if he stays on the street,
he's gonna kill someone else.

13:52.910 --> 13:55.450
Okay, I understand you two
were friends.

13:55.650 --> 13:57.450
Yeah, like you're
supposed to be.

13:57.650 --> 14:00.390
I see that you're pissed off,
but you need to get in line.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.590
There are people
all over this city

14:02.790 --> 14:04.290
finding out the justice
that they thought they had

14:04.490 --> 14:06.560
went up in flames,
and it is our job

14:06.760 --> 14:10.150
to save as many of
these cases as possible.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.270
This can't be personal.

14:13.470 --> 14:15.820
Well, it's personal to me.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.830
(sighs)

14:27.900 --> 14:29.660
Officer Janko, sir.

14:31.070 --> 14:32.830
Let's have her.

14:37.470 --> 14:39.520
Do I salute if I'm in civvies?

14:39.720 --> 14:40.860
Dealer's choice.

14:41.060 --> 14:44.410
Not necessary. Have a seat.

14:45.450 --> 14:46.300
How are you
holding up?

14:46.500 --> 14:47.300
Mm, better now.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.600
Cleared by the department,

14:48.800 --> 14:51.850
and the D.A. refused
to press charges.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.610
All good news.

14:55.810 --> 14:57.660
Yeah.

15:01.260 --> 15:03.280
Apparently not.

15:03.480 --> 15:05.850
Well, there's
been a complication.

15:06.050 --> 15:07.320
That loon
you arrested

15:07.520 --> 15:09.420
filed a civil lawsuit
against the city.

15:09.620 --> 15:10.720
You've got to be kidding.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.860
She's seeking
$2 million in damages.

15:13.060 --> 15:15.160
She resisted arrest.
It's been gone over.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.130
And still, I barely touched her.

15:17.330 --> 15:18.730
We know.

15:18.930 --> 15:22.500
She claims she is incapacitated
from the neck injury.

15:22.700 --> 15:23.600
Okay.

15:23.800 --> 15:25.840
Well, I've been cleared twice.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.210
There's no reason to think

15:27.410 --> 15:29.390
I won't be cleared again, right?

15:30.660 --> 15:33.650
Well, that's
the complicated part.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.410
GORMLEY:
Due to the lawsuit,

15:35.610 --> 15:36.850
the Civilian
Complaint Review Board

15:37.050 --> 15:39.520
will review the excessive
force allegation.

15:39.720 --> 15:42.790
You have the power to
override that, right?

15:42.990 --> 15:44.640
I do.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.640
You still believe
I'm innocent, right?

15:51.050 --> 15:52.780
I do.

15:53.980 --> 15:58.000
But it presents a conflict
of interest for me,

15:58.200 --> 16:00.820
as you correctly pointed out.

16:02.820 --> 16:06.110
(sighs) So I will have to
abide by their decision.

16:06.310 --> 16:08.880
Everyone knows CCRB is anti-cop.

16:09.080 --> 16:10.820
You will have
department counsel,

16:11.020 --> 16:13.420
and the evidence is
strongly on your side.

16:13.620 --> 16:15.700
But you won't be.

16:17.970 --> 16:19.420
I will be in spirit.

16:19.620 --> 16:23.160
Wait, if just CCRB
says I crossed the line,

16:23.360 --> 16:25.650
I could lose my job?

16:29.450 --> 16:33.070
Boss, we both know
this lawsuit is bogus.

16:33.270 --> 16:34.570
Then it will go away.

16:34.770 --> 16:37.640
But it still gives CCRB
a shot to take her down

16:37.840 --> 16:39.140
for spite.

16:39.340 --> 16:43.050
Boss, why don't we put
a TARU team on this "victim,"

16:43.250 --> 16:44.930
and see if she's really hurt.

16:48.270 --> 16:51.310
Would you do that if I wasn't
a member of the family?

17:03.120 --> 17:04.870
Did you really expect
the head of the ADTs

17:05.070 --> 17:05.940
to give up Rodriguez?

17:06.140 --> 17:07.370
It was worth a try.

17:07.570 --> 17:08.570
There's nothing here

17:08.770 --> 17:09.940
that ties him
to the crime scene.

17:10.140 --> 17:11.380
No physical
evidence,

17:11.580 --> 17:12.980
no eyewitnesses.

17:13.180 --> 17:14.450
There were two surveillance
cameras on the block,

17:14.650 --> 17:15.750
though they were disabled.

17:15.950 --> 17:17.750
Zaragoza hit men are pros.

17:17.950 --> 17:19.630
But one of them screwed up.

17:20.600 --> 17:22.520
Juan Carlos Lopez.

17:22.720 --> 17:24.160
<i>El Demonio.</i> Real psycho.

17:24.360 --> 17:27.230
They lifted his print off
a shell casing at the scene.

17:27.430 --> 17:28.030
He's doing life.

17:28.230 --> 17:29.530
But he refused

17:29.730 --> 17:31.460
to identify Rodriguez
as his accomplice.

17:31.660 --> 17:33.900
True, but maybe
after a year inside,

17:34.100 --> 17:35.950
they can make him an offer
he can't refuse.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.270
(scoffs)
That's a long shot, Danny.

17:39.470 --> 17:40.910
Well, all we've got
is long shots.

17:41.110 --> 17:43.960
It's worth a try.
The clock's ticking.

17:44.790 --> 17:47.610
(knocking on door)

17:47.810 --> 17:48.780
Mrs. Carter?

17:48.980 --> 17:50.180
I'm Detective Abetemarco.

17:50.380 --> 17:51.950
Can I help you?
Hope so.

17:52.150 --> 17:55.100
I wanted to talk to you about
the murder at the dispensary.

17:55.900 --> 17:56.950
It was horrible.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.660
Matthew was a wonderful person.

17:58.860 --> 18:00.790
And do you shop in there a lot?

18:00.990 --> 18:02.030
I have neuropathy.

18:02.230 --> 18:03.400
It really helps me
with the pain.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.430
And you were in the shop
when Matthew was killed?

18:05.630 --> 18:08.430
I was holding his hand
when he died.

18:08.630 --> 18:11.140
You told the detective
you didn't see the shooter?

18:11.340 --> 18:13.210
I took cover when
I heard the shots,

18:13.410 --> 18:15.390
and when I got up, he was gone.

18:16.760 --> 18:17.980
I'm hungry, Mama.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.480
Okay, baby,
I'll be right there.

18:19.680 --> 18:20.880
Okay.

18:21.080 --> 18:24.020
The guy who killed Matthew
is still out there.

18:24.220 --> 18:25.620
We need someone to come forward

18:25.820 --> 18:26.650
and identify him.

18:26.850 --> 18:28.420
I'd like to help you, but...

18:28.620 --> 18:29.690
Look, you're scared.

18:29.890 --> 18:31.290
I get it, the guy is dangerous.

18:31.490 --> 18:32.790
But I'm sure
you don't want him

18:32.990 --> 18:34.440
hurting somebody else.

18:35.780 --> 18:38.580
Look, I'm sorry
to have bothered you.

18:39.710 --> 18:40.980
Wait.

18:41.780 --> 18:43.100
Okay.

18:43.300 --> 18:44.870
I'll identify him.

18:45.070 --> 18:48.020
Thank you. Thank you so much.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.940
Yeah, the place
is nearly a total loss.

18:52.140 --> 18:53.550
Whatever the fire
didn't destroy,

18:53.750 --> 18:55.910
the water we used,
it finished the job.

18:56.110 --> 18:57.950
Any progress on the cause?

18:58.150 --> 18:59.220
Whoever torched
this place

18:59.420 --> 19:00.950
knew exactly what
they were doing.

19:01.150 --> 19:02.890
Could point to
a crime organization.

19:03.090 --> 19:06.260
ADTs, mafia,
drug cartel.

19:06.460 --> 19:07.830
Yeah, that's
what we thought,

19:08.030 --> 19:09.760
but the incendiary device we
found was pretty primitive.

19:09.960 --> 19:10.800
Homemade?

19:11.000 --> 19:11.960
Yeah, stuff
you can find

19:12.160 --> 19:13.300
at any hardware
store or online.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.930
What about the sprinkler system?

19:15.130 --> 19:16.430
It was functional,
but disabled.

19:16.630 --> 19:19.100
All of which could
point to an inside job.
Yeah,

19:19.300 --> 19:21.870
that's why I'm
counting on your team

19:22.070 --> 19:23.040
to figure out who around here

19:23.240 --> 19:24.660
wanted to see this place burn.

19:28.900 --> 19:32.600
(indistinct P.A. announcements)

19:39.970 --> 19:41.290
Make it fast.

19:41.490 --> 19:44.030
I don't want anybody seeing me
talking to no damn cop.

19:44.230 --> 19:45.260
You think
I want someone

19:45.460 --> 19:46.100
to see me hanging
out with you?

19:46.300 --> 19:47.400
But here you are.

19:47.600 --> 19:48.930
You heard about
the warehouse fire?

19:49.130 --> 19:50.800
It's like Christmas
up in here.
Yeah.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.840
And Rodriguez, he got a real
nice Christmas present.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.710
He's a lucky man.
Yeah,

19:55.910 --> 19:57.510
he's on his way back
to his villa in Mexico

19:57.710 --> 19:59.440
while you sit here and rot away
for the rest of your life

19:59.640 --> 20:01.710
for murders
he ordered you to commit.

20:01.910 --> 20:03.350
I don't know nothing about that.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.180
You can pretend you don't know
what I'm talking about,

20:05.380 --> 20:07.520
but we both know it doesn't
have to be this way.

20:07.720 --> 20:10.260
I swore an oath
to the Zaragozas.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.820
A cop...

20:13.020 --> 20:14.360
just wouldn't understand.

20:14.560 --> 20:17.030
You think Rodriguez would
keep his oath for you?

20:17.230 --> 20:18.230
We're done.

20:18.430 --> 20:20.630
Time served, no extradition.

20:20.830 --> 20:22.170
Federal protection.

20:22.370 --> 20:24.200
All wrapped up
with a pretty bow.

20:24.400 --> 20:27.040
Don't you think you
deserve a present, too?

20:27.240 --> 20:28.540
Is that from the Feds?

20:28.740 --> 20:29.810
Yeah.

20:30.010 --> 20:31.180
It's a one-time offer,

20:31.380 --> 20:33.300
and it will not
come around again.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.700
If you get that in writing...

20:36.930 --> 20:39.500
I'll give you Rodriguez.

20:45.510 --> 20:46.790
All you got to do
is tell me

20:46.990 --> 20:49.560
if you see the guy
who shot Matthew Lassiter.

20:49.760 --> 20:51.000
I understand.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.610
You ready?

21:01.060 --> 21:02.870
You recognize anyone?

21:03.070 --> 21:04.980
It happened so fast.

21:05.180 --> 21:07.310
Okay.
Take your time.

21:07.510 --> 21:08.530
No rush.

21:12.630 --> 21:16.740
I'm sorry.
I don't recognize anyone.

21:18.140 --> 21:19.640
Listen, listen.

21:20.510 --> 21:23.130
Why don't you just
give yourself a minute?

21:23.330 --> 21:24.360
I can't do this.

21:24.560 --> 21:25.660
I've done
a lot of these,

21:25.860 --> 21:27.300
and I think you
spotted the shooter.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.230
I was walking Amy home
from school today,

21:29.430 --> 21:31.870
and that monster came up to us.

21:32.070 --> 21:33.070
He threatened you?

21:33.270 --> 21:35.740
He said Amy was
a beautiful girl,

21:35.940 --> 21:37.740
and it would be a shame
if something happened to her.

21:37.940 --> 21:40.010
Look, he's just
trying to scare you.

21:40.210 --> 21:41.750
Well, it worked.

21:41.950 --> 21:43.150
I want to help you,

21:43.350 --> 21:46.230
but I can't have this guy
coming after my kid.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.390
I'm impressed.

21:55.590 --> 21:58.650
(chuckles) You learn a few
tricks over the years.

21:59.550 --> 22:02.570
I just wish I could
save more of this stuff.

22:02.770 --> 22:05.470
What'll you do after the
salvage operation is over?

22:05.670 --> 22:07.140
I've been assigned to
a warehouse in Red Hook.

22:07.340 --> 22:09.210
(sighs) It won't be the same.

22:09.410 --> 22:11.460
You put a lot of years
into this place.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.800
Anyone have reason
enough to act out?

22:15.830 --> 22:17.750
Are you asking me if one of
them might have set the fire?

22:17.950 --> 22:20.180
We're examining
every possibility.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.250
Look, I know these people.

22:22.450 --> 22:23.520
All the more reason
I thought you might be able

22:23.720 --> 22:24.990
to point me in
the right direction.

22:25.190 --> 22:28.290
I'm really not comfortable
making accusations.

22:28.490 --> 22:30.360
I know it's tough.

22:30.560 --> 22:31.760
I also know you understand

22:31.960 --> 22:34.180
the incredible damage
that was done here.

22:37.080 --> 22:38.100
Martin Hughes?

22:38.300 --> 22:41.070
He was recently suspended

22:41.270 --> 22:42.940
for altering time cards.

22:43.140 --> 22:45.180
He was furious, making threats.

22:45.380 --> 22:46.660
What kind of threats?

22:47.630 --> 22:50.210
He said they messed
with the wrong guy,

22:50.410 --> 22:52.620
that he...

22:52.820 --> 22:55.600
felt like burning
the place to the ground.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.750
Real tough spot.

23:04.680 --> 23:07.670
This lawsuit's
got Eddie in a box.

23:07.870 --> 23:10.540
I'm not just
thinking about Eddie.

23:10.740 --> 23:13.640
Pop, if the CCRB wants
her gone and I overrule them,

23:13.840 --> 23:16.640
I'd be right, but it
would stink to high heaven.

23:16.840 --> 23:18.960
And she sure as hell
doesn't want that.

23:19.930 --> 23:23.230
Reminds me of when you
were getting your gold shield.

23:24.800 --> 23:27.920
I didn't know
that was a problem.

23:28.120 --> 23:30.270
'Cause I never told you.

23:31.040 --> 23:32.190
On merit,

23:32.390 --> 23:33.590
you were the top candidate,

23:33.790 --> 23:36.530
but you were also the
youngest guy on the list

23:36.730 --> 23:38.130
by a good five years.

23:38.330 --> 23:40.160
With the same last name.
Yeah.

23:40.360 --> 23:44.800
Chief of D's wanted me
to put your name on the grid,

23:45.000 --> 23:46.240
wait a couple of years.

23:46.440 --> 23:47.710
But?

23:47.910 --> 23:51.810
But I had a rule
when it came to you.

23:52.010 --> 23:53.750
There was never a hook,

23:53.950 --> 23:56.730
but there was
never a sinker, either.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.850
But in this case?
In these times?

24:01.050 --> 24:01.990
Come on.

24:02.190 --> 24:04.290
I saw the bodycam footage.

24:04.490 --> 24:06.760
This "victim" could
win an Oscar.

24:06.960 --> 24:10.360
Yeah, she's sued the city twice
and settled both times.

24:10.560 --> 24:13.430
Huh. Nice work
if you can get it.

24:13.630 --> 24:15.030
Yeah, in this case,
the victim is the perp

24:15.230 --> 24:17.720
and our cop is the victim.

24:18.620 --> 24:20.570
But not if we can prove

24:20.770 --> 24:24.160
that this woman
is the grifter she is.

24:25.030 --> 24:27.750
Well, Sid wanted to put
surveillance on her.

24:27.950 --> 24:29.010
Smart move.

24:29.210 --> 24:31.380
Well, I denied the request.

24:31.580 --> 24:33.020
Why the hell would you do that?

24:33.220 --> 24:36.590
Because any evidence
collected by the department

24:36.790 --> 24:39.760
and okayed by me
would be immediately suspect,

24:39.960 --> 24:41.130
and rightly so.

24:41.330 --> 24:44.330
And like you said, "no hook."

24:44.530 --> 24:47.310
I also said "no sinker, either."

24:49.450 --> 24:51.890
Well, I'm not going to do that.

24:58.690 --> 24:59.880
Got to hand it
to you, Reagan.

25:00.080 --> 25:02.310
I can't believe you
got Lopez to flip.

25:02.510 --> 25:03.850
Well, it's 'cause
you doubted me.

25:04.050 --> 25:07.250
No, never. You still
had to sell it, though.

25:07.450 --> 25:09.350
Yeah. Did you
think I wouldn't?

25:09.550 --> 25:10.660
(phone ringing)
It's what I do.

25:10.860 --> 25:12.390
Can't wait to see
Rodriguez's face

25:12.590 --> 25:15.690
when he finds out his top
assassin flipped on him.

25:15.890 --> 25:17.060
Reagan.

25:17.260 --> 25:18.660
Yeah.

25:18.860 --> 25:20.480
When?

25:22.380 --> 25:24.340
Okay.

25:24.540 --> 25:25.470
What is it?

25:25.670 --> 25:28.810
They found Lopez
dead in his cell.

25:29.010 --> 25:30.980
(sighs)

25:31.180 --> 25:32.880
Back where we started.

25:33.080 --> 25:34.730
Yeah.

25:42.170 --> 25:43.290
I should've
seen it coming.

25:43.490 --> 25:46.190
Lopez getting killed
isn't on you, Danny.

25:46.390 --> 25:48.160
I know, but I should've
had the statement there

25:48.360 --> 25:49.990
and ready for him to sign.

25:50.190 --> 25:52.800
There's no way the Feds
could turn around

25:53.000 --> 25:54.570
a cooperation agreement
that fast.

25:54.770 --> 25:56.900
I still could've put him
into solitary or something.

25:57.100 --> 25:58.900
The Zaragozas still
could have gotten to him.

25:59.100 --> 26:00.810
What gets to me is Rodriguez,

26:01.010 --> 26:02.270
walking around
like he's untouchable.

26:02.470 --> 26:04.880
Above the law.
I'm starting to think he is.

26:05.080 --> 26:08.110
If he walks,
we'll catch him again.

26:08.310 --> 26:09.980
And how many people
have to die in the meantime?

26:10.180 --> 26:11.180
Look, I get it.

26:11.380 --> 26:14.120
Most perps kill
as a last resort,

26:14.320 --> 26:16.090
but guys like Rodriguez,

26:16.290 --> 26:17.960
that's where they start.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.510
Right.

26:23.240 --> 26:26.630
And that's exactly how we're
gonna nail this bastard.

26:26.830 --> 26:28.030
JAMIE:
Appreciate you
coming in.

26:28.230 --> 26:29.400
Didn't seem like
I had much choice.

26:29.600 --> 26:31.270
I'm just trying to
get some information.

26:31.470 --> 26:32.900
In my experience, usually means
it's time to get a lawyer.

26:33.100 --> 26:34.340
Yeah, what experience is that?

26:34.540 --> 26:36.340
I'm guessing you checked
my personnel folder.

26:36.540 --> 26:39.140
Along with everyone else's
who's worked in that warehouse.

26:39.340 --> 26:41.480
I'm the only one who
got suspended recently.

26:41.680 --> 26:43.920
And from what I hear, you were
pretty pissed off about that.

26:44.120 --> 26:45.580
Where'd you hear that?

26:45.780 --> 26:47.620
Most people would be.

26:47.820 --> 26:50.960
I altered time cards.
I got what I had coming.

26:51.160 --> 26:52.410
Why'd you do it?

26:54.510 --> 26:56.730
One of my clerks
is going through chemo.

26:56.930 --> 26:58.230
Money is tight.

26:58.430 --> 26:59.900
So, when he couldn't
make it in...

27:00.100 --> 27:01.070
You punched his time card.

27:01.270 --> 27:03.740
I deserved that suspension,

27:03.940 --> 27:06.000
but I'd do the same thing again.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.240
That sounds like you
take care of your people.

27:08.440 --> 27:10.240
We all got problems.

27:10.440 --> 27:13.360
Any of your people got problem
enough to light a match?

27:16.730 --> 27:19.420
When I got
promoted to supervisor,

27:19.620 --> 27:21.750
there was another guy who
thought he deserved the job.

27:21.950 --> 27:23.290
This guy ever make any threats?

27:23.490 --> 27:27.730
Yeah, but I figured he was
just blowing off steam.

27:27.930 --> 27:30.040
Or blowing smoke.

27:38.750 --> 27:40.020
(camera shutter clicking)

27:58.340 --> 28:01.060
Any word from CCRB?

28:01.260 --> 28:04.430
They are reviewing
the evidence.
Oh.

28:04.630 --> 28:07.000
Bunch of mice
chasing their tails.

28:07.200 --> 28:08.300
What'd your
lawyer say?

28:08.500 --> 28:09.530
(scoffs)
That it's a bad time

28:09.730 --> 28:11.520
to be accused
of police brutality.

28:13.090 --> 28:15.310
Well, is it true
CCRB hates cops?

28:15.510 --> 28:17.910
Well, I wonder where
you learned that.

28:18.110 --> 28:19.580
They do have
a legitimate

28:19.780 --> 28:20.980
oversight role.

28:21.180 --> 28:23.750
Oversight on something
they do not understand.

28:23.950 --> 28:25.380
Or even try to understand.

28:25.580 --> 28:26.820
JAMIE:
It's a civilian-run board,

28:27.020 --> 28:28.350
but they gave the PC
power over them.

28:28.550 --> 28:31.020
Which doesn't help
Eddie in this case.

28:31.220 --> 28:32.620
ERIN:
Well, welcome to
the club, Eddie.

28:32.820 --> 28:34.490
I mean, I'm proud
to be a Reagan,

28:34.690 --> 28:38.000
but sometimes, when it comes
to the job, it is a pain.

28:38.200 --> 28:39.100
Mm.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.430
I almost didn't get my intel gig

28:40.630 --> 28:41.730
because my boss
was afraid that One PP

28:41.930 --> 28:43.070
would be looking over
his shoulder.

28:43.270 --> 28:45.170
Which it wasn't,
isn't, and won't.

28:45.370 --> 28:46.370
Still, I'm in
his position,

28:46.570 --> 28:47.640
I understand
asking the question.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.910
When I first started
at the D.A.'s office,

28:50.110 --> 28:53.080
I had a supervisor who
refused to assign any cases

28:53.280 --> 28:54.650
where the defendants were a cop.

28:54.850 --> 28:56.650
They thought you'd
go easy on them?

28:56.850 --> 28:59.780
(sighs) You know,
PC's daughter, appearances,

28:59.980 --> 29:01.520
blah-blah-blah.

29:01.720 --> 29:02.920
So, what did you do?

29:03.120 --> 29:05.390
I told her that if she
doubted my objectivity,

29:05.590 --> 29:07.560
then maybe she should fire me.

29:07.760 --> 29:08.530
Ooh.

29:08.730 --> 29:09.730
Clearly, that didn't happen.

29:09.930 --> 29:11.100
You pretty much
run the place now.

29:11.300 --> 29:13.400
Well, I did promise
to recuse myself

29:13.600 --> 29:15.170
if any of you got arrested.

29:15.370 --> 29:17.400
Just when we needed you most?

29:17.600 --> 29:18.500
Right.

29:18.700 --> 29:19.300
You wouldn't hide
a little evidence

29:19.500 --> 29:20.740
to help tip the scale?

29:20.940 --> 29:23.740
Well, you know, for you?
Probably. But for Danny...

29:23.940 --> 29:25.110
Really nice.

29:25.310 --> 29:27.380
Well, let's hope we never
have to test that.

29:27.580 --> 29:28.580
Yeah.

29:28.780 --> 29:30.010
When I made detective,
I had a boss

29:30.210 --> 29:32.280
who everyone was certain
was giving me special treatment.

29:32.480 --> 29:34.350
Best tours, best cases.

29:34.550 --> 29:35.220
And?

29:35.420 --> 29:37.250
He was. They were right.

29:37.450 --> 29:38.490
He was so worried

29:38.690 --> 29:39.720
that I'd go whining to Dad,

29:39.920 --> 29:42.090
he basically worked
my cases for me.

29:42.290 --> 29:44.260
Captain Albright, I recall.

29:44.460 --> 29:47.430
Captain "Not All Bright"
is how we referred to him.

29:47.630 --> 29:49.070
I transferred
out of there,

29:49.270 --> 29:51.170
and he put in his papers.
He retired

29:51.370 --> 29:53.840
and became a plumber's
contractor or something.

29:54.040 --> 29:56.140
Yeah, he always was kind of...

29:56.340 --> 29:57.490
Full of it?

29:58.330 --> 30:00.790
You got that right.

30:05.070 --> 30:07.480
A.D.A. Chu's asking
about the Riley case.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.390
Lab still had the perp's hoodie.

30:09.590 --> 30:11.490
Got a positive DNA match.

30:11.690 --> 30:13.240
Great.

30:14.610 --> 30:16.990
Heard your witness, uh,

30:17.190 --> 30:19.810
couldn't identify Freddie James.

30:20.810 --> 30:21.870
More like wouldn't.

30:22.070 --> 30:24.900
Well, she was in
a difficult position.

30:25.100 --> 30:26.750
Yeah.

30:28.320 --> 30:29.860
So what're you gonna do now?

30:30.760 --> 30:32.380
I'm gonna get
a fresh cup of coffee,

30:32.580 --> 30:34.910
and then I'm gonna work my way

30:35.110 --> 30:36.050
through that
stack of files.

30:36.250 --> 30:39.050
I meant about the Lassiter case.

30:39.250 --> 30:40.820
There is no case.

30:41.020 --> 30:42.550
You said so yourself.

30:42.750 --> 30:44.560
So you're just gonna give up?

30:44.760 --> 30:47.520
We're hemorrhaging
cases, remember?

30:47.720 --> 30:49.530
Yeah, and I also
remember you saying that

30:49.730 --> 30:51.230
if Freddie James stays
on the streets,

30:51.430 --> 30:52.400
someone else will get killed.

30:52.600 --> 30:53.830
And you told me

30:54.030 --> 30:56.480
not to take it personally.

30:57.780 --> 31:00.420
Since when have you
ever listened to me?

31:06.560 --> 31:08.400
<i>(lock buzzes)</i>

31:14.940 --> 31:16.520
Always good to see you,
Detective.

31:16.720 --> 31:18.290
So, you had Lopez killed, huh?

31:18.490 --> 31:20.860
Prison is a violent place.
I won't miss it.

31:21.060 --> 31:22.260
You're not going anywhere.

31:22.460 --> 31:23.930
My lawyers tell me different.

31:24.130 --> 31:25.400
Well, Lopez admitted
you gave the order

31:25.600 --> 31:27.460
to have seven ADTs executed.

31:27.660 --> 31:30.230
It's a shame he won't be around
to testify in court.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.740
That is a shame.
He won't be around.

31:32.940 --> 31:34.110
But I will.

31:34.310 --> 31:36.970
Anything Lopez
told you is hearsay.

31:37.170 --> 31:38.610
And inadmissible.

31:38.810 --> 31:40.240
That's exactly what I thought.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.910
That is, until the assistant
U.S. attorneys working your case

31:43.110 --> 31:45.920
told me that there are
exceptions to that rule.

31:46.120 --> 31:47.520
You're bluffing.

31:47.720 --> 31:50.090
23 exceptions, in fact,

31:50.290 --> 31:54.890
just to Federal Hearsay
Rule 803 alone. Imagine that.

31:55.090 --> 31:57.410
You never give up.

31:58.580 --> 32:00.500
Even when you should.

32:00.700 --> 32:04.670
Maybe, but when those
prosecutors get me on the stand,

32:04.870 --> 32:07.000
put me in front of that jury--

32:07.200 --> 32:09.440
me, a decorated NYPD detective

32:09.640 --> 32:11.580
and deputized
federal law officer--

32:11.780 --> 32:15.010
well, I'm gonna tell them
all about you,

32:15.210 --> 32:17.180
and when I do,

32:17.380 --> 32:20.030
it's gonna be adios, my friend.

32:22.070 --> 32:23.440
I'll see you in court.

32:49.830 --> 32:51.400
(engine starts)

33:19.760 --> 33:21.230
(tires screeching)

33:38.480 --> 33:39.910
(sirens wailing)

33:42.250 --> 33:44.470
NYPD! Freeze! Do not move!

33:44.670 --> 33:47.150
Hands behind your head!
(over loudspeaker): Don't move!

33:48.290 --> 33:51.260
OFFICER:
Hands! Hands!

33:53.230 --> 33:55.580
Danny? Danny, are you okay?

33:55.780 --> 33:58.420
You know, you guys really
took your sweet time.

33:58.620 --> 34:00.280
You scared the heck out of me.
That is not funny.

34:00.480 --> 34:01.620
Sorry.
It's not funny.

34:01.820 --> 34:03.990
I'm sorry.
(sighs)

34:04.190 --> 34:07.120
You said to wait
until they opened fire.

34:07.320 --> 34:08.360
Yeah, but not that long.

34:08.560 --> 34:10.460
Remind me to
thank Fleet Services

34:10.660 --> 34:13.560
for these bullet-resistant
doors. They actually work.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.700
Well...

34:15.900 --> 34:17.730
there was one casualty, though.

34:17.930 --> 34:19.240
That could've
been your head.

34:19.440 --> 34:21.310
Could've been.
But my plan was right.

34:21.510 --> 34:22.240
Yeah.

34:22.440 --> 34:23.370
How did you know Rodriguez

34:23.570 --> 34:24.880
would put a hit
out on you? Here.

34:25.080 --> 34:26.980
Well, you said yourself,

34:27.180 --> 34:30.330
guys like Rodriguez
always start with murder.

34:31.400 --> 34:32.980
So, when you
think about it,

34:33.180 --> 34:35.520
this whole thing
was my idea.

34:35.720 --> 34:37.450
Technically, yeah, it is.

34:37.650 --> 34:38.990
All right,
we'll split it.

34:39.190 --> 34:41.130
Okay. Beers on me when
Rodriguez goes down.

34:41.330 --> 34:43.190
Deal.
Yeah.

34:43.390 --> 34:45.380
(sighs)

34:49.820 --> 34:51.440
Sergeant Reagan.

34:51.640 --> 34:52.440
You heading home?

34:52.640 --> 34:54.270
Oh, just to shower and change.

34:54.470 --> 34:56.040
Still a ton of work to do.

34:56.240 --> 34:57.070
You saw to that.

34:57.270 --> 34:58.110
I'm sorry?

34:58.310 --> 35:00.160
I spoke with Martin Hughes.

35:01.060 --> 35:02.150
Do you think he did it?

35:02.350 --> 35:05.720
No, but he gave me
some information

35:05.920 --> 35:06.980
that pointed me toward who did.

35:07.180 --> 35:09.050
I really should be getting home.

35:09.250 --> 35:10.890
You wanted to be
warehouse supervisor?

35:11.090 --> 35:14.060
Well, I did put in the time.

35:14.260 --> 35:15.860
Twice as many years as Hughes.

35:16.060 --> 35:16.930
That's right.

35:17.130 --> 35:18.310
Unblemished record.

35:19.310 --> 35:20.760
And so, it hurt when
they passed you over?

35:20.960 --> 35:23.130
I was disappointed.

35:23.330 --> 35:25.170
According to the texts
that you sent downtown,

35:25.370 --> 35:27.400
you were seriously pissed off.

35:27.600 --> 35:30.170
I wanted my contribution
to be recognized.

35:30.370 --> 35:31.880
And so you decided to
send a message.

35:32.080 --> 35:33.040
We got a warrant

35:33.240 --> 35:35.760
to search your vehicle.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.950
Flammable liquid,

35:40.150 --> 35:42.050
smokeless gunpowder, rags.

35:42.250 --> 35:45.770
All materials consistent with
what was used to start the fire.

35:47.810 --> 35:49.890
I gave everything to this place.

35:50.090 --> 35:51.230
And then you decided
to destroy it.

35:51.430 --> 35:53.760
No, I-I never expected it
to go this far.

35:53.960 --> 35:55.070
I thought if I...

35:55.270 --> 35:56.670
if I could put the fire out...

35:56.870 --> 35:58.000
You'd be seen as a hero,

35:58.200 --> 35:59.940
and get that promotion
that you wanted?

36:00.140 --> 36:01.640
The promotion I deserved.

36:01.840 --> 36:04.410
I know that you see yourself as
the victim here, but you're not.

36:04.610 --> 36:05.810
The real victims
are out there,

36:06.010 --> 36:06.880
living their lives,

36:07.080 --> 36:09.280
no idea what's coming.

36:09.480 --> 36:10.750
Assault, rape, murder.

36:10.950 --> 36:13.150
They'll be the victims
of the perps you set free

36:13.350 --> 36:14.840
by lighting that match.

36:16.940 --> 36:18.610
Turn around.

36:19.840 --> 36:20.960
You're under arrest.

36:21.160 --> 36:22.680
(handcuffs clicking)

36:25.250 --> 36:26.430
Can I help you?

36:26.630 --> 36:29.320
Give me the cash
and the weed in the back.

36:30.750 --> 36:31.790
Hurry up!

36:37.260 --> 36:40.190
Police, don't move!
Drop the gun!

36:44.730 --> 36:45.870
(groans)

36:47.400 --> 36:48.750
You set me up.

36:48.950 --> 36:50.620
You set yourself up.
You had a free pass,

36:50.820 --> 36:51.590
and you blew it.

36:51.790 --> 36:54.020
This time
you're going away.

36:54.220 --> 36:56.280
This is for Matthew.

37:00.050 --> 37:03.180
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

37:04.150 --> 37:05.650
Going somewhere?

37:07.490 --> 37:09.270
Kind of look like
you saw a ghost.

37:09.470 --> 37:11.810
I'm surprised to
see you, Detective.

37:12.010 --> 37:14.410
Hmm, thought I'd be dead by now?

37:14.610 --> 37:16.050
I don't know what you mean.

37:16.250 --> 37:17.480
Two of the men
you sent to kill me

37:17.680 --> 37:19.620
told us that it was you
who ordered the hit.

37:19.820 --> 37:21.690
They're lying.

37:21.890 --> 37:24.260
Right. And your pal from
the yard who gave you up, too?

37:24.460 --> 37:25.560
Is he lying?

37:25.760 --> 37:27.020
You know,
you burn too many people,

37:27.220 --> 37:28.890
eventually you get bit.

37:29.090 --> 37:30.890
You can't convict me
for killing those ADTs,

37:31.090 --> 37:32.100
so you make up a new charge.

37:32.300 --> 37:34.270
No, you did that
all by yourself.

37:34.470 --> 37:36.430
I told you I was gonna testify.

37:36.630 --> 37:37.800
You could've fought it in court.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.440
You probably would've won
with your lawyers.

37:39.640 --> 37:41.870
One thing I've learned:
never trust lawyers.

37:42.070 --> 37:44.910
Mm. Instead, you just do
what you always do.

37:45.110 --> 37:47.430
Make someone dead.

37:48.460 --> 37:51.400
Only this time,
you chose the wrong guy.

37:52.430 --> 37:54.050
You were the right guy.

37:54.250 --> 37:56.250
I chose the wrong people.

37:56.450 --> 37:59.160
Well, you and those people

37:59.360 --> 38:01.590
committed conspiracy to murder

38:01.790 --> 38:04.030
and attempted murder
of a federal officer.

38:04.230 --> 38:05.700
Now, that may not be
multiple homicides,

38:05.900 --> 38:09.200
but the conspiracy alone
carries a 20-year minimum.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.100
You have to convict me first.

38:11.300 --> 38:13.150
I'll be there
to make sure they do.

38:14.020 --> 38:16.140
Do you really think you've
accomplished something?

38:16.340 --> 38:18.240
Even if you
put me away,

38:18.440 --> 38:20.610
someone else will take my place.

38:20.810 --> 38:23.410
Good. I'll go after them, too.

38:23.610 --> 38:26.220
It's a fight you can't win.

38:26.420 --> 38:29.820
Knowing that you're
gonna do 20 years

38:30.020 --> 38:31.940
is a win in my book.

38:33.970 --> 38:35.030
Gate.

38:35.230 --> 38:36.610
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

38:43.780 --> 38:44.840
Sir, I have...

38:45.040 --> 38:46.240
Officer Janko,

38:46.440 --> 38:49.390
who's just been cleared by CCRB.

38:51.290 --> 38:53.940
(chuckles) Good news.

38:54.140 --> 38:55.580
Congratulations,
Eddie.

38:55.780 --> 38:56.880
Thank you.

38:57.080 --> 38:58.520
I don't know what happened.

38:58.720 --> 39:01.350
Just, all of a sudden, she
dropped it like a hot potato.

39:01.550 --> 39:03.420
Well, whatever happened,

39:03.620 --> 39:05.660
that's great.
Yeah.

39:05.860 --> 39:07.270
Please.

39:08.910 --> 39:11.330
You know, when I was
first riding with Jamie,

39:11.530 --> 39:14.500
he'd talk about
the kind of dad you are,

39:14.700 --> 39:16.000
who sets an example

39:16.200 --> 39:18.740
with a light touch,
and who leaves you be,

39:18.940 --> 39:21.810
but somehow always knows
when you need him,

39:22.010 --> 39:25.030
and just... appears.

39:26.390 --> 39:27.380
I always wondered

39:27.580 --> 39:29.010
what that would be like.

39:29.210 --> 39:30.850
(sighs)

39:31.050 --> 39:32.470
Now I know.

39:34.640 --> 39:37.550
Well, thank you for that,

39:37.750 --> 39:42.090
but, Eddie,
I did disappear in all this.

39:42.290 --> 39:44.030
Oh, okay.

39:44.230 --> 39:46.030
I get it.

39:46.230 --> 39:48.570
Eddie, no one in this office

39:48.770 --> 39:50.330
had anything to do with it.

39:50.530 --> 39:51.600
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

39:51.800 --> 39:54.290
So, I should
just leave that there.

39:55.120 --> 39:56.690
Take it or leave it.

39:57.590 --> 40:00.930
But it's the truth.

40:01.730 --> 40:03.830
What do you say
we go for a ride?

40:09.200 --> 40:10.470
(clears throat)

40:16.110 --> 40:17.590
Hey, Pop.

40:17.790 --> 40:19.130
Hey, what're you two doing here?

40:19.330 --> 40:21.720
Eddie got some
good news.

40:22.520 --> 40:25.270
CCRB cleared me
of wrongdoing.

40:25.470 --> 40:28.440
About time those morons
got one right.

40:28.640 --> 40:29.540
Well, see,
it turns out

40:29.740 --> 40:32.280
that someone
photographed

40:32.480 --> 40:34.040
the plaintiff
changing a tire

40:34.240 --> 40:37.410
that someone
most likely

40:37.610 --> 40:39.470
let the air
out of.

40:40.530 --> 40:42.850
And guess what?

40:43.050 --> 40:44.820
She changed it
without a neck brace,

40:45.020 --> 40:46.890
nimble as a cat.

40:47.090 --> 40:48.370
Hmm.

40:50.980 --> 40:53.130
There. Good as new.

40:53.330 --> 40:54.880
(chuckles)

40:57.150 --> 40:59.640
Back in the day,

40:59.840 --> 41:03.270
if something was broken,
like this toaster say,

41:03.470 --> 41:04.940
you just fixed it.

41:05.140 --> 41:08.240
You didn't ask permission,
you didn't make a big fuss,

41:08.440 --> 41:10.950
you just grabbed a screwdriver.

41:11.150 --> 41:12.550
Back in your day?

41:12.750 --> 41:14.500
In <i>the</i> day.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.520
Henry, I wanted to say that...

And once the thing was fixed,

41:20.860 --> 41:23.360

to make a fuss.

41:34.490 --> 41:36.920
