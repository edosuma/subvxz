WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:04.238
(doo-wop music playing)

00:05.706 --> 00:08.142
- Everybody move in.

00:08.176 --> 00:10.144
New kid's about to eat it.

00:10.178 --> 00:12.646
-* Down by the river,
the cool, cool, river *

00:12.680 --> 00:13.747
- Any advice?

00:13.781 --> 00:16.150
- Yeah, duck.

00:16.184 --> 00:17.651
- Don't listen to them, Ricky.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.553
You can do it.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.322
-(sighs)

00:21.355 --> 00:24.525
*

00:24.558 --> 00:26.594
-* That's where we met *

00:26.627 --> 00:28.496
* I never will forget *

00:28.529 --> 00:31.332
* How he kissed me tenderly *

00:31.365 --> 00:32.333
(crashing)

00:32.366 --> 00:35.236
- Aw, man.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.670
- There goes our ball.

00:36.704 --> 00:39.540
- Thanks a lot, new kid.

00:39.573 --> 00:40.741
- Hey, where are you guys going?

00:40.774 --> 00:44.044
I can just hop the fence
and get it.

00:44.078 --> 00:47.181
- Nobody hops that fence.

00:47.215 --> 00:49.250
That's Josh and Lucy's place.

00:49.283 --> 00:50.451
- Who are Josh and Lucy?

00:50.484 --> 00:52.086
- Legend has it
they used to be

00:52.120 --> 00:53.721
a cool, fun couple

00:53.754 --> 00:55.189
that went out all the time.

00:55.223 --> 00:57.057
Then they passed
the one year mark,

00:57.091 --> 00:59.227
just totally gave up.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.028
- Now they never
leave the house.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.696
- Never, ever, ever, ever.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.265
- They got to go out sometime.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.534
Like if there's
a good band in town.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.369
Or to try out
that new beer garden on 9th

01:08.402 --> 01:09.403
that just opened
and looks cool.

01:09.437 --> 01:10.738
- No.

01:10.771 --> 01:13.040
All they ever do is
binge-watch shows.

01:13.073 --> 01:17.044
- I heard they watched
Making a Murderer twice.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.078
- If they already know
what happens,

01:18.112 --> 01:19.213
why would they watch it again?

01:19.247 --> 01:20.548
- Because they're freaks.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.250
- You guys are
yanking my chain.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.717
- If you're so sure
about that,

01:23.751 --> 01:25.619
I dare you to go
get that ball back.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.155
- Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.557
I ain't ever seen
a kid die before.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.292
- So what you say, Ricky?

01:31.325 --> 01:32.560
Are you scared?

01:32.593 --> 01:34.162
-(sighs)

01:34.195 --> 01:36.664
(ominous music)

01:36.697 --> 01:38.466
I ain't scared.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.668
*

01:58.286 --> 01:59.420
Got it.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.788
(plastic popping)

02:00.821 --> 02:03.624
(screams)
Amazon Prime boxes!

02:03.657 --> 02:05.259
(door opens)

02:05.293 --> 02:07.661
*

02:07.695 --> 02:10.664
(screams)

02:11.699 --> 02:13.201
- Man.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.702
I thought that was
our pad thai.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.670
- Yeah.

02:16.704 --> 02:19.673
(downtempo electronic music)

02:19.707 --> 02:20.674
*

02:20.708 --> 02:21.975
- Ah!

02:22.009 --> 02:25.213
*

02:25.246 --> 02:27.281
-(squeaks)

02:27.315 --> 02:29.016
*

02:29.049 --> 02:30.351
-(growls)

02:30.384 --> 02:33.387
*

02:46.767 --> 02:47.801
- Watched it.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.002
Watched it.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.137
Oh!
- Mm-mm.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.039
- No, we watched it.
Yeah.

02:52.072 --> 02:53.307
- Whoa, wait,
hey, hey.

02:53.341 --> 02:54.742
It's a Ken Burns documentary
we haven't seen.

02:54.775 --> 02:55.976
-(gasps)
- See, on the bottom.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.211
Shoes: The Sole
of the People.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.079
- Oh, my God.
- See?

02:59.112 --> 03:02.850
- 14 hours.
- We can do that.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.985
You know what?
It's 10:00 p.m.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.887
Why don't you and I get
a good night's sleep

03:06.920 --> 03:09.357
so we can really pay attention
when we watch it tomorrow.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.491
- Mm-hmm, yep.
- Good.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.993
- Perfect.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.896
- Bring her in.
-(giggles)

03:15.929 --> 03:18.932
(mimics airplane)

03:18.966 --> 03:19.933
-(snores)

03:19.967 --> 03:21.068
(knocking at door)

03:21.101 --> 03:23.170
(yelps)

03:23.203 --> 03:25.273
(knocking continues)
- Josh.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.107
- Who could...
- What?

03:27.140 --> 03:29.176
- Who-who could it be
at this hour?

03:29.209 --> 03:30.511
- I don't know, baby,
I'll handle it.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.780
- Okay.
- It's okay.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.283
(ominous music)

03:35.316 --> 03:36.550
- Hey, Luce.

03:36.584 --> 03:38.286
-(whispering)
What are you doing here?

03:38.319 --> 03:40.087
- What do you think we're doing?
We're going out.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.955
- Yeah?

03:41.989 --> 03:43.291
What's that got to do with me?

03:43.324 --> 03:45.125
- We want you
to come with us.

03:45.158 --> 03:47.461
- I'm sorry, you guys,
I'm out of the game.

03:47.495 --> 03:49.363
I built a sweet little life
here for myself.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.198
Me and Josh,
we got everything we need.

03:51.231 --> 03:54.468
I have HBO Go, Netflix.
I have a working SodaStream.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.404
What more could I want?

03:56.437 --> 03:58.306
- Come on, Luce. What about the
old days?

03:58.339 --> 04:00.207
No one partied
like you did.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.742
-(scoffs)

04:01.775 --> 04:03.277
- You were the best
in the biz.

04:03.311 --> 04:04.745
- What do you say, old-timer?

04:04.778 --> 04:08.215
You got enough gas left
in that tank for one last job?

04:08.248 --> 04:11.719
- Is everything okay
out there, honey?

04:11.752 --> 04:13.053
- Yeah, baby, I'll be in
in a minute.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.989
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

04:16.023 --> 04:19.226
Look, I'm sorry
you wasted your time.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.896
- Come on, guys, I guess she
doesn't care about dancing.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.632
*

04:24.665 --> 04:25.733
- Dancing?

04:25.766 --> 04:27.568
- Oh, didn't I mention?

04:27.601 --> 04:29.603
It's '90s night
at the Groove House.

04:29.637 --> 04:31.772
Not like you'd care,
of course.

04:31.805 --> 04:32.806
- No, of course not.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.443
*

04:35.476 --> 04:37.177
Are they gonna play
K-Ci & JoJo?

04:37.210 --> 04:39.079
- It's the word on the street.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.415
- When it gets late, are they
gonna play '80s jams?

04:41.449 --> 04:42.850
- Most likely.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.485
- And then, presumably,
when everyone gets drunk enough,

04:44.518 --> 04:45.819
they'll abandon the theme
completely

04:45.853 --> 04:47.488
and play modern hits
like Taylor Swift?

04:47.521 --> 04:48.656
- Or the Biebs.

04:48.689 --> 04:49.790
- Goddamn it, I'm in.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.526
Here's how it's going down:

04:52.560 --> 04:54.161
we hit the club at midnight
after the couples

04:54.194 --> 04:56.630
have gone home, but before
the singles start throwing up.

04:56.664 --> 04:59.032
Robin's "The Wheels."
She'll call the Uber.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.668
Her phone is always fully
charged because she never

05:00.701 --> 05:01.935
calls or texts anyone.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.337
- It's true.

05:03.371 --> 05:04.672
- Chris is "The Fingers."

05:04.705 --> 05:05.873
He'll get the drinks.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.441
He used to be a waiter,
so he knows

05:07.475 --> 05:09.943
how to carry
a bunch of drinks at once.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.645
- Meghan's "The Muscle."

05:11.679 --> 05:12.813
She'll get us in the center
of the dance floor

05:12.846 --> 05:14.848
by any means necessary.

05:14.882 --> 05:17.951
I also brought in Chang.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.454
*

05:20.488 --> 05:22.523
He's a master contortionist
who trained for 16 years

05:22.556 --> 05:24.157
at the Shanghai Circus--
he can fold his body

05:24.191 --> 05:25.859
into a box the size
of a domestic carry-on.

05:25.893 --> 05:28.829
- Whoa.
What's his job?

05:28.862 --> 05:31.031
- My roommate's the DJ.
I can get us all on the list.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.966
- Oh, cool.
- Yep.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.536
- It's too bad you got rid
of all your "going out" tops.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.371
- Oh.
Did I?

05:37.405 --> 05:38.739
*

05:50.183 --> 05:51.885
- Wh... what's going on, Lucy?

05:51.919 --> 05:53.421
- I'm going out for a bit.

05:53.454 --> 05:54.822
Dancing.
- Oh.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.924
I... I thought those days
were behind you.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.158
- Honey...

05:58.191 --> 06:00.193
(sultry jazz music)

06:00.227 --> 06:01.562
Listen.

06:01.595 --> 06:04.732
I just got to do this
one more time, okay?

06:04.765 --> 06:05.899
Don't you trust me?

06:05.933 --> 06:07.668
- Oh, yes, of course
I trust you.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.838
I'm just worried about
what might happen.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.940
- What's gonna happen?
- Well, what if you're hungover?

06:12.973 --> 06:13.941
Hmm?
- Hmm?

06:13.974 --> 06:15.509
- What if those shoes

06:15.543 --> 06:16.510
give you blisters?

06:16.544 --> 06:17.911
- Listen,

06:17.945 --> 06:20.548
don't you worry
that pretty little head

06:20.581 --> 06:22.683
about those things,
all right?

06:22.716 --> 06:24.117
I love you.
- I love you.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.619
- Come here.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.923
Now Mama's got to
Macarena.

06:29.957 --> 06:32.560
(Wax Tailor's "I Had a Woman"
playing)

06:32.593 --> 06:34.695
-* He's a lying one *

06:34.728 --> 06:36.930
(jazzy electronic music)

06:36.964 --> 06:37.931
* Oh *

06:37.965 --> 06:39.933
*

06:39.967 --> 06:40.934
(phone beeps)

06:40.968 --> 06:43.070
*

06:43.103 --> 06:44.572
* She was nice *

06:44.605 --> 06:46.707
* The loving kind *

06:46.740 --> 06:48.075
- Hey, I'm on the list.

06:48.108 --> 06:50.444
Chang.
With a plus-four.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.446
*

06:58.752 --> 07:01.789
-(grunting)

07:01.822 --> 07:04.324
(growls)

07:04.357 --> 07:06.794
*

07:06.827 --> 07:07.995
(whoops)

07:08.028 --> 07:09.830
Good to have you back.
-(laughs)

07:09.863 --> 07:12.500
We did it!
ALL: (whoop)

07:12.533 --> 07:15.503
-* Hey, hey-oh *

07:15.536 --> 07:16.504
* Oh *

07:16.537 --> 07:17.971
* Hey, hey-oh *

07:18.005 --> 07:20.340
-* Oh, oh, baby *

07:20.373 --> 07:21.609
-* Hey, hey-oh *

07:21.642 --> 07:23.477
-* Baby *

07:23.511 --> 07:24.912
- Oh!
God, I'm sorry.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.079
Are you okay?

07:26.113 --> 07:27.615
- Uh, yeah,
don't worry about it.

07:27.648 --> 07:31.485
*

07:31.519 --> 07:32.820
- Okay.

07:32.853 --> 07:35.856
*

07:35.889 --> 07:37.491
- Cool phone case.

07:37.525 --> 07:39.593
- Oh, thank you.
- Where'd you get it?

07:39.627 --> 07:41.829
- Uh, actually, I'm a graphic
designer, so I made it.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.430
- Oh, that's awesome.
- Thank you.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.965
- Actually--
weird coincidence,

07:44.998 --> 07:46.934
because I'm looking for
a new logo to be designed.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.135
- Oh.

07:48.168 --> 07:49.703
- I'd love to check out
your stuff.

07:49.737 --> 07:51.505
Is it cool
if I get your number?

07:51.539 --> 07:53.507
- Oh, of course.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:53.541 --> 07:54.675
Sure, sure.

07:54.708 --> 07:55.843
Thanks.

07:55.876 --> 07:59.012
*

07:59.046 --> 08:01.515
-(chuckles)
- For you.

08:01.549 --> 08:02.983
- Lucy.
- Yep.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.451
- I'm Owen.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.019
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.555
Hope we see each other soon.

08:07.588 --> 08:08.889
- Sure.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.792
*

08:11.825 --> 08:13.527
- Whoo!
Who was that?

08:13.561 --> 08:15.128
That dude's hot as shit.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.664
- Oh, no, no, no.
That was... that was,

08:16.697 --> 08:18.465
um, different...
that was a work thing.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.400
- Looks like he's got
a real thick dick.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.703
- And real thick balls.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.638
*

08:24.672 --> 08:25.639
-(snoring)

08:25.673 --> 08:26.674
(door opens)

08:28.576 --> 08:31.579
(snoring continues)

08:35.849 --> 08:38.151
Hmm.
You're back.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.087
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.421
How was it?

08:41.454 --> 08:43.090
- Oh, it was okay.
It was all right.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.491
- Mm?
- Yeah.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.728
(soft music)

08:47.761 --> 08:48.996
(phone buzzes)

09:04.111 --> 09:06.279
NARRATOR (on TV): Few people
know that the word "shoe"

09:06.313 --> 09:09.516
comes from the Latin word
"shoeus," meaning "to foot."

09:09.549 --> 09:10.884
- "Shoeus."

09:10.918 --> 09:12.953
Man, this is really
heating up.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.454
- Yeah, guess so.

09:14.487 --> 09:17.490
(phone buzzing)

09:19.126 --> 09:21.128
I'm just gonna... yeah.
- Yeah, sure.

09:23.496 --> 09:24.765
- Hello?

09:24.798 --> 09:26.233
- Lucy, hey, it's Owen.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.968
- Hey.
Oh, hey, um, what's up?

09:28.001 --> 09:29.870
- Look, I know this is
super short notice,

09:29.903 --> 09:32.906
but I'd love to get together
today to talk about that logo.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.307
I know it's Saturday,
so no worries

09:34.341 --> 09:35.909
if you're doing something fun.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.044
- Um... uh...

09:37.077 --> 09:38.311
- And when Australopithecus

09:38.345 --> 09:39.980
wrapped moss around their feet

09:40.013 --> 09:41.148
and fastened it with bark,

09:41.181 --> 09:43.083
the shoe took its first step.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.786
- Holy shit.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.821
- Why don't you just
text me the address?

09:47.855 --> 09:49.289
- Great.
- Okay, bye.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.291
(lively jazz music)

09:51.324 --> 09:53.493
- Hey, don't worry,
I can rewind it.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.295
- I've actually got to go
to a work thing.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.830
- On a Saturday?
- Yeah.

09:56.864 --> 09:58.832
- Oh, that sucks.
- I know, I'm sorry.

09:58.866 --> 10:02.002
(sighs)
It's gonna be super boring.

10:02.035 --> 10:05.005
(epic music)

10:05.038 --> 10:07.941
*

10:07.975 --> 10:10.343
- Hey, you made it.
- Hi, how are you?

10:10.377 --> 10:12.312
- So glad.
- Oh, hello.

10:12.345 --> 10:13.847
- I'm in dire need
of a new logo.

10:13.881 --> 10:15.916
- Okay.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.484
Whoa, you're
a treasure hunter?

10:17.517 --> 10:19.486
- Sounds more exciting
than it is, really.

10:19.519 --> 10:20.988
It's just a fancy way of saying

10:21.021 --> 10:22.355
that I'm a gentleman adventurer

10:22.389 --> 10:24.524
who deals in supernatural
antiquities.

10:24.557 --> 10:27.527
I don't know if any of this
will help with the logo.

10:27.560 --> 10:30.263
- Okay, um, well, I brought

10:30.297 --> 10:31.531
my portfolio, actually.
- Oh.

10:31.564 --> 10:33.266
- If you want to take a look
at some samples.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.502
- Great.
Oh, wow.

10:35.535 --> 10:36.970
These are fantastic.
- Thank you.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.305
- Yeah, you have
a real eye for color.

10:38.338 --> 10:39.940
- Thank you.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.141
I'm especially proud...
- Oh, this one here.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.843
Yeah, it's really quite...

10:42.876 --> 10:44.211
beautiful.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.846
(romantic music)

10:45.879 --> 10:47.480
I think I'd like something
just like this.

10:47.514 --> 10:49.482
*

10:49.516 --> 10:51.852
- Oh, um...

10:51.885 --> 10:53.186
well, I... oh!

10:53.220 --> 10:55.088
(device chimes)

10:57.057 --> 10:58.525
What the hell?

10:58.558 --> 11:00.393
(device humming)

11:00.427 --> 11:02.796
(whooshing)

11:02.830 --> 11:04.798
- So the legends are true.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.900
- What is happening?

11:06.934 --> 11:08.401
- The great pharaoh
Tatenkatesh

11:08.435 --> 11:11.038
buried his vast treasure
3,000 years ago.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.741
It was thought to be lost
in the sands of time.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.542
You just discovered the map.
- Whoa.

11:15.575 --> 11:18.511
- This is most exciting find
in my incredible life.

11:18.545 --> 11:20.413
- Where does the map lead?
- To an adventure.

11:20.447 --> 11:23.751
An adventure beyond
your wildest dreams.

11:23.784 --> 11:27.354
(phone ringing)

11:27.387 --> 11:28.822
- Oh, sorry,
I have to take this.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.390
Just one sec, one...
real quick.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.527
Hey.
- Hi, hi.

11:34.561 --> 11:36.263
I figured you might be
bored at work,

11:36.296 --> 11:38.365
so I thought I'd regale you
with a little fact-ola.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.334
While we traditionally
think of clogs as wooden,

11:41.368 --> 11:43.103
they were originally
made of clay.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.772
- That's fascinating.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.340
- Oh, my God,
it all connects.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.410
- Um, listen, work's taking
longer than I expected,

11:50.443 --> 11:51.912
so I might not
be home for supper.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.847
- Uh, well,
whenever you're done,

11:53.881 --> 11:55.916
uh, there will be
a seat waiting for you

11:55.949 --> 11:57.951
at the Ken Burns Theater.

11:57.985 --> 12:00.020
- Okay, that's great.
Bye.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.255
(epic music)

12:02.289 --> 12:03.791
Hi.
- Hey.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.392
Who was on the phone?
- Oh, it was nobody.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.360
- Khalid's just translating
a hieroglyph for me.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.862
- "The sign of Osiris..."

12:08.896 --> 12:11.364
- Lucy, we are so close.
-(chuckles)

12:11.398 --> 12:13.466
- And yet so far.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.402
I'll be taking the treasure.

12:15.435 --> 12:18.271
- Khalid!
I trusted you.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.307
- That was your first mistake,
Owen Quest.

12:20.340 --> 12:23.310
(tense music)

12:23.343 --> 12:24.945
*

12:24.978 --> 12:27.414
It appears this quest
has come to an end!

12:27.447 --> 12:28.415
*

12:28.448 --> 12:30.918
(glass shatters)

12:30.951 --> 12:32.986
(sweeping romantic music)

12:33.020 --> 12:35.322
- Are you okay?
- I'm better than okay.

12:35.355 --> 12:38.225
(wood splitting)

12:38.258 --> 12:39.827
The Russians!
Come on!

12:39.860 --> 12:42.329
(gunfire)

12:42.362 --> 12:43.797
*

12:43.831 --> 12:45.332
Got a good grip?
- Yep.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.034
- Hold on for
the ride of your life.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.574
- MAN (on TV):
Dearest Margaret,

12:54.607 --> 12:56.243
the canvas ripped again.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.411
At times, it seems
my dream of building

12:58.445 --> 13:01.581
an all-canvas shoe
may never come to pass.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.151
But, as ever, I toil on.

13:04.184 --> 13:05.685
With everlasting love,

13:05.718 --> 13:08.521
Archibald Converse.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.123
- Converse.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.159
Like the shoe!

13:12.192 --> 13:14.194
*

13:20.300 --> 13:22.469
- I think we lost them.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.471
I couldn't have done this
without you.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.040
*

13:31.478 --> 13:34.147
- I have a boyfriend.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.782
Yeah.
- Oh.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.351
I didn't realize that.

13:38.385 --> 13:40.220
I don't think you mentioned it.
- You know what, I didn't.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.354
And I really,
really should have.

13:41.388 --> 13:43.623
So I'm-I'm... I'm sorry.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.159
- Look, Lucy, I...
I don't know what's going on

13:46.193 --> 13:47.794
in your personal life
right now, but...

13:47.827 --> 13:49.462
I thought today
was pretty exciting.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.198
-(sighs)

13:51.231 --> 13:52.399
So did I.

13:52.432 --> 13:55.502
- I'd love to see
where this can go.

13:55.535 --> 13:58.371
- Okay, uh...
- Don't decide now.

13:58.405 --> 14:00.307
I've chartered a seaplane
to leave from this dock

14:00.340 --> 14:02.642
tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.011
I hope you'll be on it
with me.

14:04.044 --> 14:07.881
*

14:07.915 --> 14:10.817
- (door opens)
- Oh, hello. - Hi.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.887
Sturdy looking toe caps
on those lace-ups.

14:13.921 --> 14:17.157
As they say, toe caps
are the cobbler's best friend.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.258
- I did not know that.
- Yeah.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.526
- Nope.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.361
-(clear throat)

14:23.030 --> 14:26.033
-(halfheartedly
mimics airplane)

14:28.101 --> 14:29.536
Yes.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.304
The best.
- Yeah.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.214
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.116
Yeah, no, I just... I'm just
having trouble sleeping.

14:43.150 --> 14:44.617
- Mm.
- Yeah.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.219
- I'll make
your chamomile, then.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.287
- Okay.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.122
- You could try melatonin too.

14:49.156 --> 14:51.124
I know that four milligrams
makes you a bit groggy,

14:51.158 --> 14:52.459
so I could
break it up for you.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.626
You know what else
might help?

14:53.660 --> 14:55.562
I have today's
crossword puzzle.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.630
And there's only one word
filled in with pen,

14:57.664 --> 14:59.967
which is almost certainly
completely wrong.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.301
Aside from that,
it's brand new.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.636
I know that always
helps me fall asleep.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.405
- You're such a good guy.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.474
(soft music)

15:07.507 --> 15:09.042
- Are you-are you sure
you're okay?

15:09.076 --> 15:10.610
- Yeah.
Yeah, no, it's just...

15:10.643 --> 15:12.145
it's, um...

15:12.179 --> 15:13.646
it's just work stuff,
you know?

15:13.680 --> 15:16.249
- Is that the job thing
from today?

15:16.283 --> 15:18.986
- Mm-hmm.
It looks like there's a chance

15:19.019 --> 15:22.255
it could turn into something
really exciting.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.224
But...

15:24.257 --> 15:27.327
I'm not sure if I want
to take the risk.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.963
- Well... (sighs)

15:29.997 --> 15:31.131
You want to know
what I think?

15:31.164 --> 15:33.166
*

15:33.200 --> 15:34.334
Do it.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.970
Go for it.
Jump in with both feet.

15:37.004 --> 15:39.506
Lucy, one of the things
that I love about you

15:39.539 --> 15:41.474
is how brave you are.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.143
Carpe diem.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.677
Problem solved.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.713
(kettle whistling)

15:50.050 --> 15:52.385
(epic music)

15:53.153 --> 15:55.155
*

15:59.192 --> 16:01.161
- Owen!

16:01.194 --> 16:02.595
Hi.
- You came.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.497
I'm so glad.
- Hey...oh.

16:04.531 --> 16:07.167
I... Hey, hey, wait,
I actually, um...

16:07.200 --> 16:09.869
I just came
to give you this.

16:09.902 --> 16:12.205
It's your logo.

16:12.239 --> 16:13.540
I've got a couple different
color options

16:13.573 --> 16:14.974
depending on whether
you want to put it

16:15.008 --> 16:16.443
on a submarine
or a land vessel.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.346
- I take it
you're not coming, then?

16:19.379 --> 16:20.613
- I'm sorry.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.649
- Don't you want a life
of excitement?

16:22.682 --> 16:24.217
Adventure, wonder?

16:24.251 --> 16:27.287
- Yeah, I really do.
Um...

16:27.320 --> 16:29.656
Just not with you.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.891
- I understand.

16:31.924 --> 16:35.228
I suppose this quest...

16:35.262 --> 16:37.964
has come to an end.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.899
Thank you for the design.
- Yeah.

16:39.932 --> 16:43.170
- Oh, shoot, I don't actually
have any cash.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.072
- Oh, it's okay,
you can just Venmo me.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.407
- I don't have Venmo.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.409
Oh, you know what?

16:51.378 --> 16:52.679
Here.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.214
Take this.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.249
It's a stone totem
from the Incan Empire.

16:56.283 --> 16:58.051
- Cool.

16:58.085 --> 17:00.587
*

17:00.620 --> 17:03.590
Good-bye, Owen.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.558
- Good-bye, Lucy.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.594
*

17:09.429 --> 17:11.098
To the great unknown!

17:11.131 --> 17:12.432
(airplane engine roaring)

17:18.371 --> 17:21.040
(gun clicks)

17:21.074 --> 17:22.475
- Ugh!

17:24.144 --> 17:26.279
What are you still
doing here?

17:26.313 --> 17:28.047
Why aren't you on that plane?

17:28.081 --> 17:30.350
Did you turn down
the great Owen Quest?

17:30.383 --> 17:31.618
- Um, yeah.

17:31.651 --> 17:34.687
- Did you not see him?
Did you not smell him?

17:34.721 --> 17:36.556
- He smells great, I just...
I-I have a boyfriend, so...

17:36.589 --> 17:38.024
- Wow.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.093
Your boyfriend must be
the most exciting man

17:40.127 --> 17:41.494
in the world.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.632
(door opens)

17:45.665 --> 17:47.066
- Hi.
- Hey.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.468
- Hey.
- Oh, neat thingy.

17:48.501 --> 17:49.569
- Oh, yeah.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.938
- Uh, you arrived
just in time.

17:51.971 --> 17:53.640
I'm just about to start
the last episode.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.442
Uh, "Shoes:
The Future of Shoes."

17:55.475 --> 17:57.310
Uh, do you want
to watch it with me?

17:57.344 --> 17:58.978
- Um...

17:59.011 --> 18:00.447
yeah, sure.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.149
I'll, uh...
I'll order some pad thai.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.150
- I'll get it for you.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.317
Whoa!

18:04.351 --> 18:06.052
(device clanking)

18:06.085 --> 18:07.154
Look at that.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.389
Whoa!

18:09.422 --> 18:11.191
(device chimes)

18:12.625 --> 18:15.895
- It's a map.
- Stone the crows.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.465
Uh, should...
should we call someone

18:18.498 --> 18:21.000
who knows how to handle
something like this?

18:21.033 --> 18:23.270
Like a gentleman adventurer?

18:23.303 --> 18:26.005
- Uh, yeah, no, definitely.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.074
Definitely could call someone.
- Yeah.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.310
Or...

18:30.343 --> 18:32.512
I mean, we could follow the map.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.147
- Ser-Seriously?

18:34.181 --> 18:37.450
Like, us?
- Yeah.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.352
Yeah, why not?
We could...

18:39.386 --> 18:40.587
we could skip the pad thai

18:40.620 --> 18:43.022
and go search
for buried treasure.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.624
- Yeah.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.626
Yeah, why-why not?

18:46.659 --> 18:48.995
I mean, it's been a while
since we went out.

18:49.028 --> 18:50.029
- Really?
You're up for it?

18:50.062 --> 18:51.198
- Of course.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.800
Lucy, I'm up for anything,
if it's with you.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.603
(epic music)

18:56.636 --> 18:58.371
- Got a good grip?
- You bet I do.

18:58.405 --> 19:00.307
- Get ready for
the ride of your life.

19:00.340 --> 19:03.042
*

19:07.414 --> 19:10.149
- What a crazy night!
- Oh, my God.

19:10.183 --> 19:12.685
- That tomb... that mummy!
- The mummy!

19:12.719 --> 19:14.287
The mummy was
super weird, right?

19:14.321 --> 19:15.822
- Super, super weird.
- He was super weird.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.990
- Remember when he was like,
"Give me back my treasure!"

19:18.024 --> 19:19.392
- "You will cursed
for all eternity."

19:19.426 --> 19:20.793
-(growling)
- Sounded just like that!

19:20.827 --> 19:22.161
It was just like that.
- Oh, my God.

19:22.195 --> 19:23.563
- It was kind of too bad
that all of our gold

19:23.596 --> 19:24.964
turned to sand
at the end there, though.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.999
- Yeah, yeah, indeed,
but we learned

19:27.033 --> 19:29.001
a pretty cool lesson
about greed.

19:29.035 --> 19:30.002
- We did.
That's true, we did.

19:30.036 --> 19:32.038
- So...
- Yeah.

19:32.071 --> 19:33.573
- NARRATOR (on TV):
Will the shoes of tomorrow

19:33.606 --> 19:36.743
be bigger or smaller?
Wider or narrower?

19:36.776 --> 19:37.910
Taller or shorter?

19:37.944 --> 19:39.178
- You know what?

19:39.212 --> 19:40.713
I was thinking,
what do you say

19:40.747 --> 19:42.849
every Saturday you and I

19:42.882 --> 19:45.418
get dressed up and go on
a treasure hunt?

19:45.452 --> 19:47.153
Or do something else fun?

19:47.186 --> 19:49.155
Like try out that new
beer garden on 9th

19:49.188 --> 19:50.423
that just opened
and looks cool.

19:50.457 --> 19:52.158
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.393
You know, I feel like
maybe lately

19:53.426 --> 19:55.027
we've been in a bit of a rut,

19:55.061 --> 19:58.931
and, you know,
I'll do my part to fix it.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.533
- Knee high or ankle high?

20:00.567 --> 20:02.068
Roomy or tight?

20:02.101 --> 20:03.770
No one can say,
but across the board,

20:03.803 --> 20:05.372
academics agree that shoes

20:05.405 --> 20:07.707
will remain roughly
the size of feet.

20:07.740 --> 20:10.343
- All right, is it just me,
or is this thing really boring?

20:10.377 --> 20:11.411
- Really incredibly boring.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.945
I was actually just
thinking that.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.882
- Well, maybe we could
do something else?

20:15.915 --> 20:17.950
- Like what?
- I have some ideas.

20:17.984 --> 20:21.288
(rock music)

20:21.321 --> 20:24.357
-* Do you ever
think about me now? *

20:24.391 --> 20:26.259
*

20:26.293 --> 20:31.230
* Do you ever
say my name out loud? *

20:31.264 --> 20:34.401
* When you open up
your window *

20:34.434 --> 20:36.269
* Do you ever
hear me calling? *

20:36.303 --> 20:39.939
* Am I ever on your mind? *

20:39.972 --> 20:41.140
*

20:41.173 --> 20:46.078
* Am I ever on your mind? *

20:46.112 --> 20:50.983
* When you are going
for a walk around *

20:51.017 --> 20:55.922
* Do you ever
see me in the crowd? *

20:55.955 --> 20:58.758
* When you are looking
in the mirror *

20:58.791 --> 21:00.427
* Do you think... *

21:03.363 --> 21:05.365
