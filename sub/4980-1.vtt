BOY: Somebody help me! I can't swim!

01:28.833 --> 01:31.079
Get the raft!

02:02.408 --> 02:04.488
Somebody help me!

05:31.789 --> 05:33.869
(GASPS)

05:55.647 --> 05:57.716
What is that?

05:57.816 --> 06:00.810
DARK-HAIRED BOY: It's a glow stick.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.099
How does it work?

06:06.199 --> 06:09.103
From some kind of chemical.

06:09.203 --> 06:12.160
(BIRDS CALL)

06:20.005 --> 06:22.908
Do you think anybody else is here, sir?

06:23.008 --> 06:26.749
It's just an island.
There's nothing here.

06:30.433 --> 06:33.973
- I'm thirsty.
- Yeah, me too. I'm hungry.

06:34.895 --> 06:38.633
What if there's no water?

06:38.733 --> 06:42.136
We're all thirsty and we're all hungry.

06:42.236 --> 06:45.181
We should just try and get some sleep.

06:45.281 --> 06:49.900
And tomorrow we'll figure out
what we're gonna do.

07:24.864 --> 07:27.058
(WHISPERS) Water.

07:27.158 --> 07:29.237
Water.

08:30.681 --> 08:32.760
Sir. Sir.

08:34.268 --> 08:36.347
I found water.

09:29.908 --> 09:33.067
BOY: Well, that's it, Colonel.

09:54.183 --> 09:56.262
What's that?

09:57.645 --> 10:00.047
It's a conch.

10:00.147 --> 10:02.926
My granny had one.

10:03.026 --> 10:09.269
If it had a hole in it right there
you could really blow it, like a trumpet.

10:17.540 --> 10:20.250
Come on! Give us some.

10:38.020 --> 10:39.171
(COUGHS)

10:39.271 --> 10:41.470
Sh! Come on.

11:30.115 --> 11:32.194
(HORN-LIKE SOUND)

11:35.287 --> 11:41.192
Okay, listen up. Whoever holds the conch
gets to speak. That's the rule.

11:41.292 --> 11:43.361
Is this like assembly, sir?

11:43.461 --> 11:47.115
Yeah. Except anybody
who wants to speak gets to.

11:47.215 --> 11:49.535
But not before they get the conch.

11:49.635 --> 11:54.623
Right. There doesn't seem
to be anybody here except us.

11:54.723 --> 11:56.917
- And a pig.
- It was a wild boar.

11:57.017 --> 12:00.254
No, it was a regular pig.
Big, but regular.

12:00.354 --> 12:03.507
A regular pig must have
got here from people.

12:03.607 --> 12:06.344
Yeah. If there's pigs, there's people.

12:06.444 --> 12:11.557
Okay, cadets. Like I said,
this island's probably uninhabited.

12:11.657 --> 12:16.103
- We don't know. We've gotta explore.
- DARK-HAIRED BOY: There's a lot to do.

12:16.203 --> 12:22.235
But the main thing is, we're not
by ourselves. We got Captain Benson.

12:22.335 --> 12:24.414
Can I speak?

12:27.006 --> 12:31.619
The most important thing is,
who knows we're here?

12:31.719 --> 12:36.249
Nobody knows we're here.
They know where we were going.

12:36.349 --> 12:40.503
But they don't know where we are.
We never got where we were going.

12:40.603 --> 12:44.633
- SMALL BOY: Where were we going?
- We were going home.

12:44.733 --> 12:46.682
(GROANING)

12:48.820 --> 12:51.389
DARK-HAIRED BOY:
I'm sure they're looking.

12:51.489 --> 12:55.060
We should set up some kind
of steady signal, like a fire,

12:55.160 --> 12:59.815
and keep it going all the time.
And we're gonna have to have rules.

12:59.915 --> 13:02.161
(CAPTAIN BENSON COUGHS)

13:05.336 --> 13:08.247
Can I have the conch?

13:09.424 --> 13:13.412
Yes, Ralph's right.
We've definitely gotta make a fire.

13:13.512 --> 13:17.208
- Sir, are you the leader?
- Jack's the oldest.

13:17.308 --> 13:20.712
- But Ralph's the colonel.
- I think it should be Ralph.

13:20.812 --> 13:23.589
- I vote for Ralph.
- Yeah, he's a colonel.

13:23.689 --> 13:26.091
- Yeah, Ralph.
- He's the colonel. Ralph.

13:26.191 --> 13:30.930
- I guess you just won the election.
- It doesn't matter who's in charge.

13:31.030 --> 13:35.198
We've just gotta work together.
First, we build a camp.

13:53.511 --> 13:55.591
Be careful.

13:56.848 --> 14:02.545
There's probably a lot of berries and
things that look okay but are really poison.

14:02.645 --> 14:05.090
I know what's poisonous or not.

14:05.190 --> 14:10.304
My brother did Outward Bound,
learned how to survive. He taught me.

14:10.404 --> 14:14.600
Did he do Outward Bound in the tropics?

14:14.700 --> 14:17.313
- Not exactly.
- Then where?

14:18.370 --> 14:19.980
Colorado.

14:20.080 --> 14:25.319
There are totally different poison plants
in Colorado than in this place.

14:25.419 --> 14:28.990
So we've gotta take precautions
or it won't matter.

14:29.090 --> 14:33.077
- What won't matter?
- Whether we get rescued.

14:33.177 --> 14:37.414
Better learn to live with yourself,
because we ain't gonna get rescued.

14:37.514 --> 14:40.793
- What are you talking about?
- Just being logical.

14:40.893 --> 14:46.424
A plane goes down in the ocean, there's
no wreckage - who's gonna find us?

14:46.524 --> 14:50.679
- Why don't you just shut up?
- Are you telling me to shut up?

14:50.779 --> 14:55.892
What we need around here is positive
people, not people trying to scare people.

14:55.992 --> 14:58.436
What we don't need is you, shitbrain.

14:58.536 --> 15:01.648
BOY:
His name's not shitbrain. It's Piggy.

15:01.748 --> 15:03.946
Yeah, Piggy! Yeah!

15:06.044 --> 15:08.238
(BOY SNORTS LIKE A PIG)

15:08.338 --> 15:11.378
Shut up. Everybody just shut up.

15:13.635 --> 15:18.749
- It's just cos you're new.
- No, it's not. It's always this way.

15:18.849 --> 15:21.676
RALPH: Just cut it out, okay?

15:23.395 --> 15:27.257
- BOY: (CHANTS) Mama, mama, can't you see
- ALL: (CHANT) Mama, mama, can't you see

15:27.357 --> 15:31.345
- What the army's done to me?
- What the army's done to me?

15:31.445 --> 15:35.349
- They put me in a barber's chair.
- They put me in a barber's chair.

15:35.449 --> 15:39.228
- Spun me round, I had no hair.
- Spun me round, I had no hair.

15:39.328 --> 15:43.149
- I used to drive a Cadillac.
- I used to drive a Cadillac.

15:43.249 --> 15:47.152
- Now I'm marching in a pack.
- Now I'm marching in a pack.

15:47.252 --> 15:50.823
- I used to drive a Chevrolet.
- I used to drive a Chevrolet.

15:50.923 --> 15:54.786
- Now I'm marching for my pay.
- Now I'm marching for my pay.

15:54.886 --> 15:58.581
- They took away my TV.
- They took away my TV.

15:58.681 --> 16:02.502
- Got me doing IOT.
- Got me doing IOT.

16:02.602 --> 16:06.506
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:06.606 --> 16:08.685
BOY: Whoa, oh, oh.

16:12.195 --> 16:15.521
- Come on, let me try.
- I got it, I got it.

16:17.784 --> 16:19.728
Shit!

16:19.828 --> 16:22.272
- Damn! Mother...
- Swearing won't help.

16:22.372 --> 16:26.443
- Listen, Piggy, shut your fat ass.
- Hold it! Hold it!

16:26.543 --> 16:31.073
Hey, wait a minute.
Piggy, give me your glasses.

16:31.173 --> 16:33.826
- Hey, give 'em back.
- Trust me.

16:33.926 --> 16:36.635
What are you doing?

17:01.287 --> 17:04.411
- Fire!
- ALL: Yeah!

17:27.314 --> 17:30.467
RALPH: Jesus, it's spreading!
Put it out. Stomp on it.

17:30.567 --> 17:33.857
Come on, run and stomp on it.

17:36.531 --> 17:39.476
Beat it back. Use your jacket.

17:39.576 --> 17:43.116
Beat it back.
Come on, guys, beat it back.

19:04.746 --> 19:10.236
About time you showed up. People ought
to be fined for being late for fire watch.

19:10.336 --> 19:12.203
Bullshit.

19:24.558 --> 19:27.670
JACK: The forest was totally dark,

19:27.770 --> 19:31.716
but he had to keep going
because the thing was behind him.

19:31.816 --> 19:34.636
The pus was everywhere.

19:34.736 --> 19:41.184
He could feel it and, all the while,
the thing behind him kept coming closer.

19:41.284 --> 19:44.270
And then, suddenly,

19:44.370 --> 19:49.943
he realised it wasn't any normal plants
or bushes he was trying to run through.

19:50.043 --> 19:53.655
It wasn't the leaves or plants
brushing up against him,

19:53.755 --> 19:56.282
touching his arms and face.

19:56.382 --> 20:00.787
It was thousands of claws,
long claws, grasping at him,

20:00.887 --> 20:04.208
trying to stop him
and hold him for the thing.

20:04.308 --> 20:09.755
And he tried to get away, but they held on,
choking him. He tried to scream. Argh!

20:09.855 --> 20:11.934
(SCREAMS)

20:17.154 --> 20:19.598
It's only a story.

20:19.698 --> 20:22.312
It's not real.

20:24.954 --> 20:29.399
RALPH: I don't know if he can hold up.
What if he suddenly gets really sick?

20:29.499 --> 20:33.779
JACK: Man, you gotta stop worrying
so much. We got it made.

20:33.879 --> 20:38.743
No parents, no teachers,
no academy, no girls.

20:38.843 --> 20:41.371
Of course,
I wouldn't mind getting a little.

20:41.471 --> 20:46.054
- Like you ever got any.
- Well, I still wouldn't mind.

20:53.942 --> 20:56.344
Oh! My arm.

20:56.444 --> 20:58.972
You okay?

20:59.072 --> 21:01.152
Psych!

21:35.526 --> 21:38.437
Nearly got him. Next time.

21:42.491 --> 21:45.616
Do you think it has any protein in it?

21:47.288 --> 21:50.080
Here, give it here.

21:57.840 --> 22:02.673
I heard they're supposed
to taste like chicken.

22:38.924 --> 22:41.586
Want some?

22:54.857 --> 22:57.566
- Are you telling the truth?
- Yeah.

22:59.278 --> 23:03.103
- We don't believe you.
- Yeah, you're lying.

23:03.908 --> 23:07.437
Why aren't you getting ready?

23:07.537 --> 23:09.939
BOY: Sir, is it really true?

23:10.039 --> 23:14.622
You bet it is. Simon's right.
We're gonna be rescued.

23:15.670 --> 23:19.578
Get your things together, guys.
We're going home.

24:39.255 --> 24:40.955

(GROANS)

25:00.068 --> 25:02.137
RALPH: Beat it, you kids.

25:02.237 --> 25:06.406
Come on. Why isn't anybody
getting food or wood?

25:14.583 --> 25:16.283
(YELLS)

25:43.780 --> 25:46.821
- Spit! Come on!
- Come on! Spit!

25:47.576 --> 25:49.644
- Spit!
- Go on, spit!

25:49.744 --> 25:51.938
- Spit.
- I got it. There it is.

25:52.038 --> 25:56.026
No, you're not gonna get out
until I see it splash in the ocean.

25:56.126 --> 26:00.294
- That made it.
- No, I didn't see it splash.

26:01.674 --> 26:04.715
- Ow!
- See? It splashed again.

26:06.761 --> 26:09.756
Ha! It's our turn to have fun.

26:16.772 --> 26:18.639
Assembly!

26:25.864 --> 26:27.944
What's going on?

26:29.034 --> 26:32.230
The reason I'm calling this assembly is,

26:32.330 --> 26:37.777
too many people are screwing around and
not working. There's a bunch of things.

26:37.877 --> 26:40.405
Some kids don't know
when to use the bathroom.

26:40.505 --> 26:43.199
There was this one kid the other day,

26:43.299 --> 26:46.035
he took a shit in his pants
and then sat in it.

26:46.135 --> 26:51.134
I'm not naming names cos it's possible
Mikey couldn't help it.

26:53.560 --> 26:57.089
Was it green? Was it running
down your legs?

26:57.189 --> 27:00.341
Everybody shut their goddamn mouths!

27:00.441 --> 27:03.518
Ralph's got the conch.

27:04.613 --> 27:07.307
All I mean is, we have
to have more discipline.

27:07.407 --> 27:10.519
And more spearfishing.
We've gotta have real food.

27:10.619 --> 27:15.358
- BOY: We should be hunting pigs.
- That's all I got to say.

27:15.458 --> 27:19.569
- Anyone else want the conch?
- Some jerk-off stole my pocketknife.

27:19.669 --> 27:22.281
Yeah, things are disappearing all over.

27:22.381 --> 27:26.077
- What are we gonna do with thieves?
- Kick the shit out of them.

27:26.177 --> 27:30.164
- Shove their dick in the conch!
- Put a stick up their butt.

27:30.264 --> 27:33.092
- Ram it in there!
- Okay, okay!

27:35.310 --> 27:38.589
RALPH: We can't have kids
stealing and running wild.

27:38.689 --> 27:44.220
We're gonna have to have stricter rules.
And hand out demerits, I guess.

27:44.320 --> 27:46.306
- Demerits!
- Demerits?

27:46.406 --> 27:48.808
Demerits for grand larceny?

27:48.908 --> 27:51.985
- Eat shit and die.
- Yeah!

27:58.793 --> 28:00.541
Sir?

28:01.463 --> 28:03.657
Are we ever going home?

28:03.757 --> 28:07.578
Of course we are,
as soon as they see our signal.

28:07.678 --> 28:11.715
Jack says that we're never
gonna be rescued.

28:12.474 --> 28:15.752
No, you misunderstood him.
That's not what he meant.

28:15.852 --> 28:19.840
That's exactly what I meant.
There's eight million islands out here.

28:19.940 --> 28:23.594
Why should they find this one?

28:23.694 --> 28:27.723
Don't listen to him.
We will be rescued, Peter.

28:27.823 --> 28:30.151
Honest.

28:41.087 --> 28:44.616
Are you going hunting for pigs again?
I wanna come next time.

28:44.716 --> 28:46.629
Me too.

28:48.385 --> 28:51.095
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

29:08.364 --> 29:10.777
Hey, cut it out.

29:11.451 --> 29:14.409
Are you crazy? Stop it.

29:20.502 --> 29:23.613
You know why Jack got sent
to military school?

29:23.713 --> 29:27.367
- Because he was in trouble.
- Who says?

29:27.467 --> 29:31.997
Tony. Jack told him he took a car
and drove it on the highway.

29:32.097 --> 29:36.877
- He's a liar. He didn't steal a car.
- He didn't say he stole it.

29:36.977 --> 29:39.255
He borrowed it. It was a neighbour's.

29:39.355 --> 29:44.343
And the neighbour was away and he just
borrowed it and drove it on the highway.

29:44.443 --> 29:47.930
He probably rode his dad's bicycle
around the block.

29:48.030 --> 29:51.476
- Then how come he got arrested?
- Yeah, by the highway patrol.

29:51.576 --> 29:54.403
They got him doing 80.

29:57.873 --> 29:59.538
Ugh!

30:01.127 --> 30:02.162
Ugh!

30:12.097 --> 30:14.499
What time is it?

30:14.599 --> 30:17.293
What difference does it make?

30:17.393 --> 30:22.594
Well, if I knew what time it was
I'd know what's on TV.

30:25.485 --> 30:29.523
- I'm not even sure what day it is.
- It's Monday.

30:31.241 --> 30:34.519
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

30:34.619 --> 30:37.564
Mondays. Monday's ALF.

30:37.664 --> 30:43.153
ALF comes on at eight o'clock.
It's a lot later than eight.

30:43.253 --> 30:47.575
Yeah. But I bet we're in
a different time zone.

30:47.675 --> 30:53.705
I bet it's really about eight o'clock and
ALF's causing some trouble right now.

30:53.805 --> 30:55.672
Yeah.

31:20.708 --> 31:24.655
JACK: They're mean and they move fast.
They ain't gonna be easy to kill.

31:24.755 --> 31:27.380
You gotta get 'em first time,
in the heart.

31:27.480 --> 31:30.069
I guess the spear's
gotta be real sharp.

31:33.012 --> 31:35.874
We have to have a strategy.
You know, trick 'em.

31:35.974 --> 31:38.669
Oh, sure. How we supposed to do that?

31:38.769 --> 31:42.715
You just smoke 'em out.
You crawl up, light a little fire.

31:42.815 --> 31:45.938
We have to practise on stuff that moves.

31:47.861 --> 31:49.561
Ew.

31:50.489 --> 31:52.854
Jesus Christ.

32:18.393 --> 32:21.921
When do we do it?
I mean, like, what time of day?

32:22.021 --> 32:26.384
You always go right before dawn.
Maybe you can catch 'em asleep.

32:26.484 --> 32:28.351
(PANTING)

32:39.580 --> 32:41.862
Simon!

32:55.305 --> 32:58.291
Simon can't stay with him
every single second.

32:58.391 --> 33:00.056
Sh.

33:02.187 --> 33:04.506
And he's scared of everyone else.

33:04.606 --> 33:10.429
I'm scared of him. He's crazy.
We've gotta do something.

33:10.529 --> 33:14.516
- RALPH: Maybe we should tie him down.
- JACK: That or get rid of him.

33:14.616 --> 33:19.438
Come on. He's hurt bad and he has
a fever. We've gotta take care of him.

33:19.538 --> 33:23.359
ROGER: Why bother?
He ain't gonna make it.

33:23.459 --> 33:27.711
- We've gotta take care of ourselves.
- Exactly.

34:06.961 --> 34:08.828

34:47.085 --> 34:49.248
RALPH: Captain Benson!

34:54.344 --> 34:56.424
SIMON: Captain!

34:59.016 --> 35:01.094
Captain Benson!

35:13.280 --> 35:15.360
Captain Benson!

35:16.283 --> 35:19.477
RALPH: Save your breath, man.

35:19.577 --> 35:23.746
He's gotta be close by.
He's probably just lost.

35:30.005 --> 35:31.670
Look.

35:45.771 --> 35:50.260
RALPH: It's nobody's fault, Simon.
He just didn't know what he was doing.

35:50.360 --> 35:54.597
I don't think it's what you think.
I don't think he's dead.

35:54.697 --> 35:57.683
- Why not?
- Where are his shoes?

35:57.783 --> 35:59.978
We've gotta keep looking.

36:00.078 --> 36:02.772
He just swam out in 'em.

36:02.872 --> 36:07.611
And his belt? He left his pants
and swam out in his shoes and belt?

36:07.711 --> 36:10.419
He was crazy, Simon.

36:42.622 --> 36:43.815
(GRUNTING)

36:43.915 --> 36:46.527
- There it is! Get it!
- Get it!

36:48.377 --> 36:50.456
- Kill it!
- Yeah!

36:57.804 --> 37:01.166
JACK: Roger, are you okay, man?
That was some jump.

37:01.266 --> 37:04.175
I got him right up his ass.

37:05.311 --> 37:08.020
- Right up the ass!
- Yeah!

37:12.902 --> 37:16.181
- Get him! Get him!
- Yeah!

37:16.281 --> 37:19.322
Hey, come on! Cut it out! Stop it!

37:24.789 --> 37:27.914
- You dorks. It hurt.
- I know it hurt.

38:37.405 --> 38:42.269
I've been thinking about a clock.
We could make a clock.

38:42.369 --> 38:45.272
Yeah, sure, Piggy. Then a TV.

38:45.372 --> 38:50.038
No, really. We could make a sundial
with a stick in the ground.

38:51.294 --> 38:53.374
What's that noise?

38:56.925 --> 38:59.005

39:00.304 --> 39:03.291
- Look, there it is!
- Help!

39:03.391 --> 39:05.835
Over here!

39:05.935 --> 39:09.177
- Help!
- Please!

39:31.169 --> 39:33.497
Over here!

39:33.713 --> 39:35.662

Over here!

40:16.632 --> 40:20.285
If you guys hadn't let the fire go out
they would have seen it.

40:20.385 --> 40:23.664
- Hey, man, we were hunting.
- Great. Killed a pig.

40:23.764 --> 40:26.667
Face it, you fucked up.
We could have been rescued.

40:26.767 --> 40:30.213
Back off, man.
I'm sick of your shit and so's my gang.

40:30.313 --> 40:32.674
Your gang? What's that supposed to mean?

40:32.774 --> 40:37.855
It means that if you know what's good for
you you'll stop trying to run everything.

40:39.613 --> 40:42.227
Stop it!

40:49.666 --> 40:54.821
I'm sick of this. I'm gonna make a camp
for hunters and guys who wanna have fun.

40:54.921 --> 40:56.239
GANG: Yeah!

40:56.339 --> 40:59.546
Come on, that's crazy.
We've gotta work together.

41:00.301 --> 41:03.664
- Come on, what do you say?
- I say fuck you.

41:03.764 --> 41:06.458
And that goes for you too, Miss Piggy.

41:06.558 --> 41:10.383
Come on, let's get out
of this kindergarten.

41:18.362 --> 41:22.308
- I'm with you, Jack.
- Right on, Larry.

41:22.408 --> 41:28.118
When you other brats get older or get
hungry enough, you can come join us too.

41:42.929 --> 41:46.053
They're back! Simon, they're back!

42:01.656 --> 42:05.518
- Where's your brother?
- I don't know.

42:05.618 --> 42:09.193
He must be in the other shelter.

42:13.710 --> 42:17.665
Quick, get out of there!
That tree's gonna go!

45:14.062 --> 45:17.186
- Yeah?
- Over here. We found fruit.

45:35.417 --> 45:37.736
Do you think the other guys are okay?

45:37.836 --> 45:42.087
- Who cares?
- Okay, dork. I was just asking.

45:46.011 --> 45:48.803
We should relight the fire.

46:08.826 --> 46:11.938
- Gross.
- BOY: Where are they?

46:12.038 --> 46:15.691
BOY 2: If they didn't get blown away
they're probably hunting.

46:15.791 --> 46:21.322
What good will that do? They can't cook
pigs without a fire. They'll get trichinosis.

46:21.422 --> 46:24.914
- What's that?
- It's bugs that live in pigs.

46:27.053 --> 46:29.133
We knew that.

49:03.254 --> 49:05.334
- (GROANS)

What's this shit about a monster?
We'll send you back to kindergarten.

49:22.733 --> 49:26.220
- I'm serious.
- Okay, what kind of monster?

49:26.320 --> 49:30.557
Did it have fur and poisoned fangs,
or long, slimy tentacles?

49:30.657 --> 49:34.978
It growled and it came out at me.
And its mouth, it was wet.

49:35.078 --> 49:38.274
- Maybe it was a bear.
- Sounds more like a reptile.

49:38.374 --> 49:41.368
Sounds more like bullshit.

- Yeah.

50:37.101 --> 50:40.012
Whatever it is, it's in there.

51:00.958 --> 51:04.528
You should have seen it.
He was scared shitless.

51:04.628 --> 51:09.367
Do you think there was something there?
Some kind of wild animal or something?

51:09.467 --> 51:13.914
- I know it. We heard it growl.
- Is it close?

51:14.014 --> 51:18.042
Just over the big rise
behind our camp. Real close.

51:18.142 --> 51:20.222
Holy shit.

51:23.106 --> 51:26.645
- I just thought you ought to know.
- Yeah.

51:28.153 --> 51:30.862
Thanks for the fire.

- Better keep on your toes tonight.
- What do you mean?

51:46.255 --> 51:48.991
- You'll find out.
- What are you doing with that?

51:49.091 --> 51:53.543
Next time we kill a pig,
we're gonna have a barbecue.

51:55.347 --> 52:00.127
- You mean no one's on fire watch?
- Why can't we have the fire down here?

52:00.227 --> 52:03.506
If we want anybody to see the smoke
it's gotta be up there.

52:03.606 --> 52:06.175
Nobody wants to be
up there alone any more.

52:06.275 --> 52:09.678
There's something loose
on this island - a monster.

52:09.778 --> 52:12.689
- There's no monster.
- There's something.

52:13.824 --> 52:17.854
- PIGGY: So what do you want?
- Jack wants the survival knife.

52:17.954 --> 52:20.023
It's not his. It belongs to the camp.

52:20.123 --> 52:23.360
Yeah? Well, there's a new camp now,
and he wants it.

52:23.460 --> 52:26.405
Yeah, and Tony wants his shoes,
socks and his junk.

52:26.505 --> 52:29.157
Take Tony's stuff
but you can't have the knife.

52:29.257 --> 52:34.537
- He's a defector. Another damn defector.
- It's because of the monster.

52:34.637 --> 52:38.125
I told you there's no monster.
Tony knows there's no monster.

52:38.225 --> 52:42.421
Tony just wants to be a hunter
and he's too chickenshit to get his stuff.

52:42.521 --> 52:45.173
But what if there is
some kind of big animal?

52:45.273 --> 52:46.973
Yeah.

53:01.499 --> 53:05.277

- Don't you know?
- Yeah, but I'm not going back.

55:41.162 --> 55:44.565
- I already showed Jack and the others.
- Tell me where it is.

55:44.665 --> 55:46.692
You shouldn't go there.

55:46.792 --> 55:50.533
I just want to look.
I've got a glow stick.

I made you a promise and I kept it. Say it!

01:06:36.583 --> 01:06:40.122
That's what it was...
a terrible accident.

01:06:51.682 --> 01:06:53.761
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:06:56.228 --> 01:06:59.005
We came here to see
if you guys have any fire.

01:06:59.105 --> 01:07:01.185
Ours is out.

01:07:03.318 --> 01:07:07.273
- Everything's out.
- On account of the storm.

01:07:10.284 --> 01:07:13.195
We gotta get back.

01:07:14.663 --> 01:07:17.107
Hold on a minute.

01:07:17.207 --> 01:07:19.902
I wanna talk to you about last night.

01:07:20.002 --> 01:07:21.322
Ralph.

01:07:23.506 --> 01:07:26.075
We left early.

01:07:26.175 --> 01:07:29.086
BOTH: We were real tired.

01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:46.555
- It isn't fair.
- I never touched it.

01:07:46.655 --> 01:07:49.224
- He didn't.
- ROGER: Butt out, or you'll get it.

01:07:49.324 --> 01:07:53.561
From now on, any more criminals
are gonna be put on that island to starve.

01:07:53.661 --> 01:07:57.691
- Give it to him. Whip him.
- Now you're gonna get it.

01:07:58.291 --> 01:07:59.870
(ALL SHOUT) Yeah!

01:08:14.850 --> 01:08:17.428
- (BOY YELLS IN PAIN)
- Stop it!

01:08:22.274 --> 01:08:27.220
I'll get fire, I promise you.
Tomorrow we'll hunt again.

01:08:27.321 --> 01:08:31.058
But we have to be careful
cos the monster might come any time.

01:08:31.158 --> 01:08:33.185
But didn't we... I thought we...

01:08:33.285 --> 01:08:37.189
No. It could come again any time,
in any shape.

01:08:37.290 --> 01:08:40.912
Just when we're not ready,
it could be there.

01:09:05.276 --> 01:09:09.859
PIGGY: Maybe we should
just build a raft and row off.

01:09:11.198 --> 01:09:14.573
RALPH: I will if you will.

01:09:17.122 --> 01:09:21.818
- Well?
- We don't really know what's out there.

01:09:21.917 --> 01:09:25.656
I bet you out past the reef
lots of boats come by every day,

01:09:25.756 --> 01:09:27.908
and one of them could rescue us.

01:09:28.008 --> 01:09:31.953
Yeah? Well, suppose it didn't.
Suppose it was Russian.

01:09:32.054 --> 01:09:34.832
Then what? We'd be taken prisoner.

01:09:34.932 --> 01:09:38.001
The Russians wouldn't take us prisoner.

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:41.630
I don't know. Major Dingledine,
my new dad, told me...

01:09:41.729 --> 01:09:43.841
Major Dingledine?

01:09:43.941 --> 01:09:47.636
Yeah. He said that if
the Russians invaded the US,

01:09:47.737 --> 01:09:52.688
they would take the kids
and separate us from our parents -

01:09:53.576 --> 01:09:55.853
and I know it sounds weird -

01:09:55.953 --> 01:10:01.664
but they might make us go into
the Olympics or something like that.

01:10:02.543 --> 01:10:05.322
- I don't see what's so funny.
- Piggy,

01:10:05.422 --> 01:10:10.171
I don't think you have to worry about the
Russians forcing you into the Olympics.

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:20.392
Hey, what's that?

01:10:50.551 --> 01:10:53.260
(SINGS BACH'S MINUET IN G)

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:00.295
Where do you think it comes from?

01:11:00.395 --> 01:11:05.062
A Russian submarine,
full of Olympic athletes.

01:11:20.082 --> 01:11:22.161
(RUSTLING)

01:11:46.108 --> 01:11:48.817
Ralph, wake up.

01:11:51.238 --> 01:11:54.100
- What is it?
- Sh. Just listen.

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:57.407
There's someone out there.

01:12:00.622 --> 01:12:03.829
- I don't hear anything.
- Sh. Listen.

01:12:05.169 --> 01:12:07.700
(RUSTLING)

01:12:11.509 --> 01:12:14.496
JACK: I hear you there, Piggy.

01:12:14.596 --> 01:12:18.086
Come outside, Piggy. I want you, Piggy.

01:12:19.141 --> 01:12:21.753
HUNTER: Ha, Piggy!

01:12:21.853 --> 01:12:24.847
Come on out, Piggy.

01:12:27.901 --> 01:12:30.313
(PIGGY WAILS)

01:12:33.782 --> 01:12:37.143
Why can't you just leave us alone?

01:12:37.243 --> 01:12:39.396
- HUNTER: Yagh!
- (PIGGY WAILS)

01:12:39.496 --> 01:12:41.857
- Give 'em back!
- I got the glasses!

01:12:41.957 --> 01:12:44.036
(HUNTERS CHEER)

01:13:02.603 --> 01:13:04.470
(CRYING)

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:15.147
Here.

01:13:30.881 --> 01:13:35.870
We did everything just the way
grown-ups would have.

01:13:35.970 --> 01:13:38.680
Why didn't it work?

01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:45.171
Things'd be much better, Ralph,
if it wasn't for him.

01:13:45.271 --> 01:13:48.229
I wish he was dead.

01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:52.309
- No, you don't.
- I do.

01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:01.564
We could just give up
and join his tribe.

01:14:01.664 --> 01:14:04.983
Then we'd at least be with the others.

01:14:05.083 --> 01:14:07.531
No, Piggy.

01:14:08.170 --> 01:14:11.994
Ralph, I can't see.

01:14:13.509 --> 01:14:15.921
I know.

01:14:44.707 --> 01:14:47.318
- Halt! Who goes there?
- (WHISTLES)

01:14:47.418 --> 01:14:49.930
RALPH: Don't be stupid.
You know who we are.

01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:52.741
We brought the conch.
I'm calling an assembly.

01:14:52.841 --> 01:14:55.828
- Where's Jack?
- JACK: What do you want now?

01:14:55.928 --> 01:14:59.622
RALPH: You heard. We brought the conch.
I'm calling an assembly.

01:14:59.722 --> 01:15:04.878
Why don't you two fuck off? This is my
end and my tribe. Keep to your own end.

01:15:04.978 --> 01:15:09.341
You won't keep to your end, tearing up
our camp and stealing Piggy's glasses.

01:15:09.441 --> 01:15:12.303
- You've gotta give 'em back.
- Got to? Who says?

01:15:12.403 --> 01:15:14.482
I do.

01:15:15.697 --> 01:15:19.810
Piggy can't see. If you wanted to have
a fire all you had to do was ask.

01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:24.328
- I don't have to ask!
- Come on! Yeah! Yeah!

01:16:01.119 --> 01:16:02.986
(CONCH)

01:16:08.626 --> 01:16:13.365
- PIGGY: I've got the conch. Let me speak.
- Get outta here, Piggy.

01:16:13.465 --> 01:16:15.544
(HUNTERS JEER)

01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:22.066
Stop that, Roger. Let Piggy speak.

(WOLF-WHISTLES)

01:16:25.143 --> 01:16:28.755
Please. This is serious.

01:16:28.855 --> 01:16:33.059
Get out, fat ass. Get away.
Go back to your own camp.

01:16:34.987 --> 01:16:37.181
What I wanna say is,

01:16:37.281 --> 01:16:42.482
if we don't get rescued
we might have to live here for a long time.

01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:46.473
Maybe the rest of our lives.

01:16:48.375 --> 01:16:54.668
If we are stuck here until we get old
then we can't go on acting like kids.

01:16:56.009 --> 01:16:59.287
We've gotta be sensible
and make things work.

01:16:59.387 --> 01:17:01.086
No!

01:17:31.045 --> 01:17:33.948
You're not gonna get away with this.

01:17:34.048 --> 01:17:38.035
Yeah? And what are you gonna do? Huh?

01:17:38.135 --> 01:17:41.413
What are you gonna do about it?

01:17:41.513 --> 01:17:45.053
You're out of it, pal.
You're on your own.

(BIRD SQUAWKS)

About time.

- You guys by yourselves?
- Yep.

01:18:42.952 --> 01:18:47.647
- Listen, you two, you have to stay awake.
- Give us a break.

01:18:47.747 --> 01:18:51.401
What do you think? You have to be 11
or you can't stand a watch?

01:18:51.501 --> 01:18:53.783
Just stay awake.

01:18:59.385 --> 01:19:03.456
What's the big deal?
There's nobody left except Ralph.

01:19:03.556 --> 01:19:06.709
They're scared of the monster.

01:19:06.809 --> 01:19:11.262
You said we didn't believe
in the monster. You said.

01:19:12.732 --> 01:19:15.607
I'm pretty sure we don't.

01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:44.956
(WHISPERS) Sam! Eric!

01:19:45.056 --> 01:19:47.167
It's me.

01:19:47.267 --> 01:19:49.586
You shouldn't be around here, Ralph.

01:19:49.686 --> 01:19:53.299
You're not allowed. The hunters
are gonna come after you.

01:19:53.399 --> 01:19:59.096
Yeah. And Jack had Roger
sharpen his stick at both ends.

01:19:59.196 --> 01:20:03.642
If that happens, it'll be
because you let it happen.

01:20:03.742 --> 01:20:08.814
If you don't stand up to him
you're just another one of his slaves.
