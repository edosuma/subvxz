WEBVTT

00:03.304 --> 00:04.605
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

00:04.638 --> 00:06.640
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT TIME
WE'LL GET OUT OF HERE?

00:06.674 --> 00:08.776
NOBODY LIKES TO WORK LATE.

00:08.809 --> 00:10.178
LEAST OF ALL ME.

00:11.812 --> 00:13.481
DO YOU HAVE PLANS TONIGHT?

00:13.514 --> 00:14.415
NO, I DON'T.

00:14.448 --> 00:15.816
REMEMBER WHEN YOU TOLD US
NOT TO MAKE PLANS

00:15.849 --> 00:16.784
'CAUSE WE WERE WORKING?

00:16.817 --> 00:19.653
YES, I REMEMBER.

00:19.687 --> 00:22.456
MMM, THIS IS B.S.
THIS IS B.S.

00:22.490 --> 00:23.757
WHY ARE WE HERE?

00:23.791 --> 00:25.259
I AM GONNA CALL CORPORATE.

00:25.293 --> 00:27.261
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

00:27.295 --> 00:29.097
I'M--GOD, I'M SO MAD!

00:29.130 --> 00:31.832
THIS IS MICHAEL SCOTT,
SCRANTON.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.101
WELL, WE DON'T WANT
TO WORK.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.835
NO, WE DON'T!

00:34.868 --> 00:36.737
IT'S NOT FAIR TO THESE PEOPLE.

00:36.770 --> 00:41.142
[shouting]
THESE PEOPLE ARE MY FRIENDS,
AND I CARE ABOUT THEM!

00:41.175 --> 00:43.144
WE'RE NOT GONNA DO IT!

00:43.177 --> 00:43.777
[hangs up phone]

00:43.811 --> 00:44.645
EVERYBODY,

00:44.678 --> 00:46.780
I JUST GOT OFF THE HORN
WITH CORPORATE.

00:46.814 --> 00:50.784
AND BASICALLY I TOLD THEM
WHERE THEY COULD STICK

00:50.818 --> 00:52.153
THEIR LITTLE OVERTIME
ASSIGNMENT.

00:52.186 --> 00:53.254
GO ENJOY YOUR FRIDAY.

00:53.287 --> 00:55.089
THANK YOU, MICHAEL.
ALL RIGHT.

00:55.123 --> 00:56.624
OH, WELL,

00:56.657 --> 00:57.758
I THINK WE DODGED
A BULLET THERE.

00:57.791 --> 00:58.759
I THINK YOU DID.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.094
I THINK WE SHOULD
CELEBRATE.

01:00.128 --> 01:02.196
HOW ABOUT YOU, PAM,
MI CASA--

01:02.230 --> 01:03.431
A LITTLE DINNER,
DANCING, DRINKS?

01:03.464 --> 01:05.166
OH, I--
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T
HAVE PLANS.

01:07.435 --> 01:09.737
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.439
MICHAEL HAS ASKED PAM AND ME
TO DINNER

01:11.472 --> 01:13.841
AT LEAST NINE TIMES.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.843
AND EVERY TIME, WE'VE BEEN ABLE
TO GET OUT OF IT.

01:15.876 --> 01:18.679
BUT I'VE GOT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.481
HE GOT ME.

01:20.514 --> 01:23.184
BECAUSE I'M STARTING
TO SUSPECT

01:23.217 --> 01:25.553
THAT THERE WAS NO ASSIGNMENT
FROM CORPORATE.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.655
MICHAEL, WHAT TIME
SHOULD I BE ARRIVING?

01:27.688 --> 01:29.690
DWIGHT,
IT'S COUPLES ONLY.

01:29.723 --> 01:32.526
AND BESIDES, I ONLY HAVE
SIX WINE GLASSES.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.163
SO IT WILL BE ME AND JAN,
AND PAM AND JIM.

01:35.196 --> 01:37.498
AND ANGELA AND ANDY.

01:37.531 --> 01:38.832
HEY-YO!

01:38.866 --> 01:41.569
DOES IT BOTHER ME
THAT I WASN'T INVITED

01:41.602 --> 01:43.171
TO MICHAEL'S DINNER PARTY?

01:43.204 --> 01:44.572
[scoffs]

01:50.578 --> 01:53.181
[cheerful music]

01:53.214 --> 02:00.488
*

02:23.977 --> 02:25.579
HI.
HELLO.

02:25.613 --> 02:27.215
HOW ARE YOU?
COME ON IN.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.582
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

02:28.616 --> 02:29.883
(Jan)
CHILLY, HUH?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.519
I'M SO GLAD
WE FINALLY, UH--

02:31.552 --> 02:33.387
FINALLY GOT TO DO THIS
WITH YOU GUYS.

02:33.421 --> 02:34.722
(Jim)
THIS IS GREAT.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.525
YOU WANT TO--YOU WANT
TO TAKE THEIR COATS, BABE?

02:37.558 --> 02:38.859
YES, I WOULD.
OKAY.

02:38.892 --> 02:41.662
SO WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN DOING?

02:41.695 --> 02:43.664
LET'S SEE, SINCE I SAW YOU
AN HOUR AGO?

02:43.697 --> 02:44.665
YEAH.

02:44.698 --> 02:45.799
I HAVE BEEN
GETTING READY,

02:45.833 --> 02:46.900
AND THEN DRIVING
OVER HERE.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.969
WELL, WE'VE BEEN DOING
PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.738
REALLY?
EXCEPT DRIVING.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.206
WE--

02:52.240 --> 02:53.607
WE GOT YOU THIS.

02:53.641 --> 02:55.876
OH, WELL, PAM,
THANK YOU.
OH, VINO.

02:55.909 --> 02:58.979
THIS WILL BE GREAT
TO COOK WITH--REALLY.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.681
HAVE A SEAT,
OR COME ON IN.

03:00.714 --> 03:03.517
OR, I DON'T KNOW,
MAKE YOURSELF TO HOME.

03:03.551 --> 03:04.918
THIS IS OUR CASA.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.820
(Pam)
REALLY NICE.

03:06.854 --> 03:07.921
SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?
SHOULD WE DO THE TOUR FIRST?

03:07.955 --> 03:09.290
SHOULD WE HAVE
APPETIZERS FIRST?

03:09.323 --> 03:10.724
TOUR.
LET'S DO THE TOUR FIRST.

03:10.758 --> 03:11.959
OKAY.
OKAY.

03:11.992 --> 03:13.394
YOU HAVE A PREFERENCE, BABE?
UPSTAIRS FIRST?

03:13.427 --> 03:14.495
TOTALLY YOUR CALL, BABE.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.330
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
LET'S GO THEN.

03:16.364 --> 03:18.799
I SAY UPSTAIRS.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.834
OH, YOU GUYS DOING
A LITTLE CONSTRUCTION?

03:20.868 --> 03:23.404
OH, JUST REDOING
THE SLIDING GLASS DOOR.

03:23.437 --> 03:26.006
YEAH, SO SORRY
ABOUT THIS GOD-AWFUL CARPET.

03:26.039 --> 03:29.310
WE ARE STILL A WORK
IN PROGRESS HERE.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.645
THIS IS MY OFFICE.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.581
YEP.
NEVER BEEN USED.

03:33.614 --> 03:34.982
NOT SUPER-EXCITING.
NO.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.750
AND THIS IS MY WORK SPACE.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.919
THIS IS IT--CHECK THAT OUT.
YOU SMELL IT?

03:38.952 --> 03:41.855
(Michael)
AS YOU CAN SMELL,

03:41.889 --> 03:43.357
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT ODORS
GOING ON IN HERE.
YEAH.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.426
SO YOU HAVE AN OFFICE
AND A WORK SPACE.

03:45.459 --> 03:46.694
I DO, YOU KNOW.
I JUST--

03:46.727 --> 03:48.929
I CANNOT CREATE
IN THE SAME SPACE
[sniffing]

03:48.962 --> 03:50.130
THAT I CONDUCT BUSINESS.
OH...

03:50.163 --> 03:52.666
I'M SURE THAT YOU'RE THE SAME
WITH YOUR DOODLES. SMELL.

03:54.502 --> 03:55.669
IT'S FIRE.
UH-HUH.

03:55.703 --> 03:56.670
BONFIRE.

03:56.704 --> 03:57.938
BOND!
MEN LOVE THIS ONE.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.340
JAMES BOND FIRE!

03:59.373 --> 04:02.376
I AM BOND FIRE--
JAMES BOND FIRE.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.445
MICHAEL SCOTT!
KKKHHHHH...

04:04.478 --> 04:07.014
WHEN I GET FRUSTRATED,
OR IRRITATED,

04:07.047 --> 04:09.617
OR...ANGRY,

04:09.650 --> 04:11.885
I COME UP HERE AND I JUST SMELL
ALL MY CANDLES!

04:11.919 --> 04:13.421
AND IT JUST--POOF--
GOES AWAY.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.323
JUST LIKE THAT.
JUST LIKE THAT.

04:15.356 --> 04:17.925
SO THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.428
AND THESE WALLS, THEY USED
TO BE, LIKE, WHITE.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.529
LIKE AN ASYLUM.

04:21.562 --> 04:22.430
SO I WANTED IT
TO BE SOFTER,

04:22.463 --> 04:24.332
SO I HAD IT PAINTED
IN EGGSHELL WHITE.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.433
(Michael)
GUESS WHAT.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.468
WHITE AND EGGSHELL WHITE
ARE EXACTLY THE SAME COLOR.

04:27.501 --> 04:28.569
[laughter]

04:28.602 --> 04:29.670
BABE...
(Michael)
EXACTLY.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.872
I THOUGHT YOU SAID THAT
YOU WERE GONNA TIDY THINGS UP.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.441
(Michael)
WELL, I--

04:33.474 --> 04:34.808
SHAME ON YOU.

04:34.842 --> 04:37.311
[forced chuckle]

04:37.345 --> 04:38.812
WHAT A CUTE BENCH.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.080
(Michael)
THANKS.
THAT'S MY BED.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.683
JAN HAS, UH,
SOME SPACE ISSUES,

04:42.716 --> 04:44.318
SO I CURL UP
ON THAT PUPPY.

04:44.352 --> 04:46.053
REALLY? 'CAUSE...

04:46.086 --> 04:49.089
SEEMS PRETTY NARROW...
AND SHORT.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.691
IT'S ACTUALLY A LOT BIGGER
THAN IT SEEMS.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.826
LOOK AT THIS.
AHH...
SEE?

04:52.860 --> 04:57.665
HE FITS PERFECTLY.
[chuckles]

04:57.698 --> 05:01.869
I FINALLY BROKE DOWN
AND BOUGHT MYSELF

05:01.902 --> 05:04.972
A PLASMA TV.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.674
CHECK IT OUT.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.976
I ACTUALLY HUNG THIS
ON THE WALL MYSELF.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.944
THAT'S GOOD.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.113
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE ROOM,
YOU NEED MORE SPACE...

05:13.146 --> 05:15.683
VOILA.
RIGHT INTO THE WALL.

05:15.716 --> 05:18.018
WOW.
SOMETIMES...

05:18.051 --> 05:20.854
I WILL JUST STAND HERE
AND WATCH TELEVISION FOR HOURS.

05:20.888 --> 05:24.525
I LOVE IT.
I LOVE THIS TV.

05:24.558 --> 05:27.795
OH, AND I ALSO BUILT
THIS TABLE.

05:27.828 --> 05:28.829
WHAT IS THAT, CHESTNUT?

05:28.862 --> 05:30.998
NO, I THINK THAT IS
EITHER PINE OF NORDIC CHERRY.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.533
IT'S PINE. YEAH.

05:32.566 --> 05:33.634
MICHAEL, I'M JUST TERRIBLE
AT ALL THIS STUFF,

05:33.667 --> 05:34.635
SO THAT'S REALLY COOL.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.103
REALLY?
YEAH.

05:36.136 --> 05:38.672
YEAH, HE TRIED TO SET UP
MY TIVO FOR ME,

05:38.706 --> 05:40.508
BUT THEN I DIDN'T HAVE AUDIO
FOR A WEEK.

05:40.541 --> 05:43.744
IF YOU EVER NEED ANY HELP,
I'M JUST A PHONE CALL AWAY.

05:43.777 --> 05:46.113
I BET YOU ARE.

05:46.146 --> 05:48.749
WELL, I SAW--

05:48.782 --> 05:49.783
OH, YOUR DUNDIES.

05:49.817 --> 05:51.719
I'M SURPRISED THEY'RE NOT
OUT ON THE COFFEE TABLE

05:51.752 --> 05:52.620
FOR EVERYBODY TO SEE.

05:52.653 --> 05:55.989
WELL, IT WAS BETWEEN
THE NEON BEER SIGN

05:56.023 --> 05:57.725
AND THE DUNDIES.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.026
SO I SAID, "HONEY,

05:59.059 --> 06:00.093
KEEP THE TROPHIES."

06:00.127 --> 06:01.094
OH, HONEY,

06:01.128 --> 06:03.831
I HAVE THE BEST TROPHY
RIGHT HERE.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.065

ASIDE FROM MY DUNDIES.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.034
[doorbell rings]

06:07.067 --> 06:10.871
OH, EXCUSE US JUST A SECOND.
I'LL GET IT.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.573
SO GLAD WE WERE FINALLY
ABLE TO DO THIS.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.007
SO GLAD WE--
NO. NO.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.410
OKAY.

WHAT'S UP, TUNA?

06:17.310 --> 06:18.846
WE GONNA HAVE SOME TUNA
FOR DINNER?

06:18.879 --> 06:20.948
I BET YOU'RE SICK
OF TUNA, RIGHT?

06:20.981 --> 06:21.982
YOU PROBABLY HAVE TUNA
EVERY NIGHT.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.117
ALL RIGHT.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.653
THESE ARE FOR YOU.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.755

06:27.788 --> 06:30.458
EXCEPT FOR ONE FLOWER,
WHICH IS FOR...

06:30.491 --> 06:32.593
MY FLOWER.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.628
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH THIS?

06:34.662 --> 06:36.930
[forced chuckle]
OH, LET ME TAKE THIS.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.532
HOW 'BOUT WE DO THE SHORT TOUR,
AND THEN I'LL START DINNER?

06:38.566 --> 06:41.869
OH, I CAN HELP STARTING DINNER,
IF YOU NEED IT.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.203
NO, NO NO, IT'S JUST
THE OSSO BUCO NEEDS TO BRAISE

06:43.236 --> 06:44.472
FOR ABOUT THREE HOURS.

06:44.505 --> 06:45.706
EVERYTHING ELSE IS DONE.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.808
THREE HOURS FROM NOW,

06:47.841 --> 06:49.943

DO YOU GUYS REMEMBER
MY OLD ASSISTANT, HUNTER?

07:26.113 --> 07:28.015
HE IS

YOU KNOW WHAT--HUNTER WAS
A TERRIBLE ASSISTANT.

08:10.558 --> 08:12.025
THAT IS WHY RYAN
FIRED HIM.

08:12.059 --> 08:14.194
WELL, I THINK HE'S PROBABLY
JUST ABOUT AS RELIABLE AS PAM,

08:14.227 --> 08:15.529
BEING THAT IT USUALLY
TAKES YOU AN AFTERNOON

08:15.563 --> 08:16.396
TO GET BACK TO ME.
YEAH.

08:16.429 --> 08:21.802
SOMETIMES I THINK
SHE OLDS ON TO FAXES.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.771
[whispering]
I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY
ABOUT ME.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.172
I JUST WANT TO EAT.

08:25.205 --> 08:28.075
WHICH I REALIZE IS A LOT
TO ASK FOR.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.277
AT A DINNER PARTY.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.780
COW.
NO, IT'S A...HUMP.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.582
THERE'S A HUMP.
[inhales]

08:34.615 --> 08:35.583
JOE CAMEL.
JOE CAMEL.
YES!

08:35.616 --> 08:36.283
OKAY, YES.

08:36.316 --> 08:38.185
FIRST NAME
OF THAT ANIMAL,

08:38.218 --> 08:39.319
AND THE SECOND NAME
IS THE STATE

08:39.352 --> 08:41.655
WHERE HELENA IS
THE CAPITAL.

08:41.689 --> 08:42.790
MONTANA.
OH!

08:42.823 --> 08:45.125
JOE MONTANA?
YES! YES!

08:45.158 --> 08:47.194
TIME, TIME.
[cheers and applause]

08:47.227 --> 08:49.062
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST SAY
49ers QUARTERBACKS?

08:49.096 --> 08:50.297
ALL RIGHT, MY--MY--

08:50.330 --> 08:51.665
MY--MY TURN!

08:51.699 --> 08:53.667
MY--MY--MY--MY TURN!

08:53.701 --> 08:55.636
MY--MY--MY--MY TURN!

08:55.669 --> 08:58.271
BABE, CAN YOU JUST, LIKE,
REALLY--WHOA.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.774
YOU'RE JUST, LIKE,
REALLY--
WHAT?

09:00.808 --> 09:02.075
COULD YOU JUST
SIMMER DOWN.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.777
SERIOUSLY.
NO, I'M JUST
MAKING PEOPLE LAUGH.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.212
NO.
YES.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.180
I WAS WATCHING JIM'S FACE.
I WAS WATCHING JIM.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.716
AND HE WAS LAUGHING.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.784
NO SMILE.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.953
LOOK AT HIM.
HE'S LAUGHING.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.623
MICHAEL AND JAN
SEEM TO BE PLAYING

09:15.656 --> 09:16.990
THEIR OWN SEPARATE GAME.

09:17.024 --> 09:19.292
AND IT'S CALLED
"LET'S SEE HOW UNCOMFORTABLE

09:19.326 --> 09:20.661
WE CAN MAKE OUR GUESTS."

09:20.694 --> 09:22.730
AND THEY'RE BOTH WINNING.

09:22.763 --> 09:25.733
SO I AM GOING
TO MAKE A RUN FOR IT.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.000
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.836
I JUST GOT A MESSAGE
FROM MY LANDLORD.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.237
APPARENTLY,
MY APARTMENT FLOODED.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.205
SOMETHING WITH THE SPRINKLER.
(Jan)
OH, NO!

09:32.239 --> 09:34.642
PAM, WE SHOULD PROBABLY
GET GOING

09:34.675 --> 09:36.209
AND SEE THE DAMAGE.
OKAY.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.310
YOU DON'T NEED TWO OF YOU
TO DO THAT.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.880
JUST--

09:39.913 --> 09:42.783
(Jim)
THAT'S TRUE.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.686
UM...DINNER SOUNDED DELICIOUS.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.387
PAM, I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.356
OH, JIM, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
GOING TO ABANDON THIS PARTY HERE

09:49.389 --> 09:50.891
ALL BY ITSELF.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.793
I DON'T KNOW, BECAUSE
EVERYTHING I OWN IS THERE.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.161
YOU CAN BUY NEW STUFF,

09:54.194 --> 09:55.929
BUT YOU CAN'T BUY
A NEW PARTY.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.064
THAT'S TRUE.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.666
(Michael)
THAT IS A GREAT POINT.

09:58.699 --> 09:59.733
COME ON DOWN HERE.

10:01.434 --> 10:05.338
SIT DOWN ON THAT COUCH
AND BE AMONGST FRIENDS.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.174
AND WE ARE NOT GOING
TO THINK ABOUT

10:07.207 --> 10:08.175
ALL YOUR STUFF
BEING DESTROYED.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.209
ALL RIGHT?

10:09.242 --> 10:10.310
(Andy)
MICHAEL, YOU'RE UP.

10:10.343 --> 10:11.912
HERE WE GO.
THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.213
READY...
GO!

10:13.246 --> 10:14.414
ALL RIGHT,

10:14.447 --> 10:15.749
FIRST NAME IS TOM.

10:15.783 --> 10:16.583
NO, NO, NO.
NO NAMES.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.385
NO NAMES, NO RHYMING,
NO SOUNDALIKES.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.420
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
YOU'RE GETTING INTO MY HEAD!

10:20.453 --> 10:23.256
FIRST NAME IS BLANK,
AND HE GOES ON A CRUISE.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.125
HE GOES ON A CARIBBEAN
CRUUUUUISE...

10:25.158 --> 10:26.393
I DON'T KNOW.
KATIE HOLMES.

10:26.426 --> 10:27.828
NO, BAAH!

10:27.861 --> 10:28.896
BUT HE'S MARRIED TO HER!

10:28.929 --> 10:30.731
OH, DAWSON'S CREEK.
NO! NO!

10:30.764 --> 10:31.899
IT HAS TO BE
A REAL PERSON, JIM.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.233
COME ON!
OKAY...

10:33.266 --> 10:36.203
NO, NO, I'M GONNA PASS.
I'M GONNA PASS.

10:36.236 --> 10:39.773
OKAY, RHYMES WITH
PARNOLD SCHPORZENEGGER.

10:39.807 --> 10:40.774
NO RHYMING!

10:40.808 --> 10:42.309
NOT REALLY A RHYME.

10:42.342 --> 10:43.443
ANOTHER CLUE.
ANOTHER CLUE.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.879
OKAY, HE'S THE GOVERNOR
OF CALIFORNIA.

10:45.913 --> 10:47.247
HE IS THE TERMINATOR.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.982
THOSE AREN'T HELPFUL.
TOM CRUISE!

10:49.016 --> 10:50.150
NO!
TIME!

10:50.183 --> 10:53.821
GOD!
DOES ANYBODY READ THE PAPER?!

11:01.461 --> 11:02.863
HERE YOU GO.

11:02.896 --> 11:03.964
OH, THANK YOU.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.432
YOU'RE WELCOME.

11:15.142 --> 11:20.313
I'M SO, SO SORRY
FOR THE TEMPERATURE IN HERE.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.314
THE, UM...

11:21.348 --> 11:24.051
SLIDING GLASS DOOR SHATTERED.

11:24.084 --> 11:27.487
SO...
IT'S OKAY.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.322
IT'S ACTUALLY
A REALLY CUTE STORY.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.423
DO YOU WANT
TO TELL IT, BABE,

11:30.457 --> 11:31.424
OR SHOULD I TELL IT?

11:31.458 --> 11:32.793
I DON'T LIKE
THAT STORY, BABE.

11:32.826 --> 11:33.794
COME ON!

11:33.827 --> 11:35.262
IT'S A CUTE STOR--

11:35.295 --> 11:37.965
[laughing]
MICHAEL RAN THROUGH
THE SLIDING GLASS DOOR

11:37.998 --> 11:41.268
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE HEARD
THE ICE CREAM TRUCK.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.803
STOP.
STOP IT!

11:42.836 --> 11:44.404
I MEAN, I LIKE ICE CREAM.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.839
OKAY? SUE ME.

11:45.873 --> 11:48.341
OH, NO, DON'T.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.010
I SHOULDN'T SAY THAT
JOKINGLY

11:50.043 --> 11:51.111
BECAUSE SHE WILL SUE ME.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.446
SHE LOVES TO SUE.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.948
SHE LOVES LAWSUITS.

11:54.982 --> 11:56.016
YOU KNOW, HONEY,

11:56.049 --> 11:58.986
THAT DOOR
WAS EXTREMELY CLEAN,

11:59.019 --> 12:00.187
AND IT LOOKED INVISIBLE.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.155
YOU ARE SO RIGHT.
YOU ARE SO RIGHT!

12:02.189 --> 12:03.490
BECAUSE BEFORE
I LIVED HERE,

12:03.523 --> 12:05.092
THE GLASS WAS
ALWAYS COVERED IN SMUDGES!

12:05.125 --> 12:07.394
AND I MOVED IN
AND I CLEANED IT,

12:07.427 --> 12:08.862
SO I GUESS THAT MAKES ME
THE DEVIL.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.030
[laughter]

12:10.063 --> 12:11.832
YOU ARE!
SHE IS!

12:11.865 --> 12:14.367
SHE IS THE DEVIL!
I'M IN HELL!

12:14.401 --> 12:15.435
AAH!

12:15.468 --> 12:16.469
I'M BURNING.
HELP ME.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.071
YOU SHOULDN'T JOKE
ABOUT THAT.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.206
IS THERE MORE WINE
IN THE KITCHEN?

12:19.239 --> 12:21.008
I WILL GET IT.
I WILL GET IT.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.009
WHAT KIND OF HOSTESS
WOULD I BE--

12:22.042 --> 12:22.810
IT'S OKAY,
I DON'T MIND.

12:22.843 --> 12:25.112
NO, NO, NO.
IN FACT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:25.145 --> 12:26.980
GIRLS' TRIP.
ANGELA, COME ON.

12:27.014 --> 12:29.016
GIRLS' TRIP.

12:31.351 --> 12:34.154
OH, NOT EVEN CLOSE.

12:34.187 --> 12:37.090
SO YOU KEEP
A VERY TIDY HOUSE.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.191
YOU SHOULD SEE
OUR BATHROOM

12:38.225 --> 12:39.793
AFTER MICHAEL TAKES A BATH.
WHEW!

12:39.827 --> 12:41.294
[chuckles]

12:41.328 --> 12:42.863
BUT I DON'T HAVE
TO TELL YOU, PAM.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.165
NO. YEAH.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.533
W-WHAT?

12:46.566 --> 12:48.535
OH, WELL, DON'T TELL ME
THAT HE'S REALLY CHANGED

12:48.568 --> 12:49.803
SINCE YOU GUYS DATED.

12:49.837 --> 12:51.805
OH, ARE--ARE YOU JOKING?

12:51.839 --> 12:53.273
WELL, MICHAEL TOLD ME
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT,

12:53.306 --> 12:55.375
BUT I SEE THE WAY
YOU LOOK AT HIM.

12:55.408 --> 12:58.378
I HAVE NEVER, EVER DATED

12:58.411 --> 13:01.181
OR WANTED TO DO
ANYTHING RESEMBLING

13:01.214 --> 13:02.983
DATING MICHAEL, EVER.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.852
NOT EVER, NOT NOW,
NOT THEN,

13:04.885 --> 13:07.187
NOT NOW, NOT EVER, EVER.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.321
I'VE NOTICED HOW
YOU LOOK AT HIM

13:08.355 --> 13:11.324
AT THE OFFICE.
MM-HMM.

13:13.360 --> 13:16.129
SO I SPEND MOST OF MY TIME
RIGHT HERE.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.530
HAVE A HAND.

13:17.564 --> 13:20.600
SO, JIM, I NOTICED YOU
CHECKING OUT JAN'S CANDLES.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.302
OH, NO, SHE JUST PUT IT
IN FRONT OF MY FACE.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.536
YEAH.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.306
DID YOU KNOW THAT CANDLES
ARE THE NUMBER ONE

13:26.339 --> 13:28.976
FASTEST-GROWING PRODUCT
IN THE SCENT AROMA MARKET?

13:29.009 --> 13:31.311
$2 BILLION A YEAR
INDUSTRY.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.413
AND FOR ONLY $10,000,

13:33.446 --> 13:37.117
YOU COULD BECOME A CO-OWNER
OF "SERENITY BY JAN."

13:37.150 --> 13:38.251
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT?

13:38.285 --> 13:40.120
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
I'M IN.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.089
I'M SORRY, ARE YOU REALLY TRYING
TO GET US TO INVEST

13:42.122 --> 13:43.123
IN JAN'S COMPANY?

13:45.058 --> 13:46.960
I'M SORRY.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.028
[doorbell rings]

13:48.061 --> 13:50.263
WHAT NOW?

13:50.297 --> 13:52.199
COMING.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.500
HELLO.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.202
(Jan)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:55.235 --> 13:57.537
WE CAME HERE TO EAT DINNER
AND TO PARTY.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.006
THIS IS A DINNER PARTY,
RIGHT?

13:59.039 --> 14:00.007
[whispering]
AWESOME!

14:00.040 --> 14:01.374
WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?

14:01.408 --> 14:02.910
YES, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

14:02.943 --> 14:04.444
DWIGHT IS MY FRIEND.

14:04.477 --> 14:06.346
WE WEREN'T INVITED?

14:06.379 --> 14:07.214
[scoffs]

14:07.247 --> 14:09.917
YOU SAID THAT
I COULD NOT INVITE DWIGHT

14:09.950 --> 14:12.019
BECAUSE HE WAS NOT PART
OF A COUPLE.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.988
AND BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE
ENOUGH WINE GLASSES.

14:15.022 --> 14:18.258
DWIGHT BROUGHT GLASSES
AND A PERSON.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.960
(Jan)
FINE. WHATEVER YOU WANT.
SO...

14:19.993 --> 14:21.628
JUST LIKE ALWAYS.
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

14:21.661 --> 14:22.662
WHATEVER I WANT?

14:22.695 --> 14:24.031
IT'S NEVER
WHATEVER I WANT.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.165
IT'S FINE.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.467
WHEN I WANTED TO SEE STOMP,

14:27.500 --> 14:29.469
AND YOU WANTED TO SEE WICKED,
WHAT DID WE SEE?

14:29.502 --> 14:30.904
WE SAW W--

14:30.938 --> 14:33.440
WHEN I SAID THAT I WANTED
TO HAVE KIDS,

14:33.473 --> 14:35.342
AND YOU SAID THAT YOU WANTED ME
TO HAVE A VASECTOMY,

14:35.375 --> 14:36.443
WHAT DID I DO?

14:36.476 --> 14:38.979
(Michael)
AND THEN, WHEN YOU SAID

14:39.012 --> 14:40.047
THAT YOU MIGHT WANT
TO HAVE KIDS,

14:40.080 --> 14:41.148
AND I WASN'T SO SURE,

14:41.181 --> 14:42.549
WHO HAD THE VASECTOMY
REVERSED?

14:42.582 --> 14:43.416
AND THEN WHEN YOU SAID

14:43.450 --> 14:44.617
YOU DEFINITELY DIDN'T WANT
TO HAVE KIDS.

14:44.651 --> 14:45.986
WHO HAD IT REVERSED BACK?

14:46.019 --> 14:48.088
SNIP, SNAP! SNIP, SNAP!
SNIP, SNAP!

14:48.121 --> 14:49.456
(Michael)
I DID!

14:49.489 --> 14:51.124
OKAY...

14:51.158 --> 14:52.392
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
THE PHYSICAL TOLL

14:52.425 --> 14:55.162
THAT THREE VASECTOMIES HAVE
ON A PERSON!

14:55.195 --> 14:57.697
AND I BOUGHT THIS CONDO

14:57.730 --> 14:59.066
TO FILL WITH CHILDREN.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.268
I AM SO SORRY

15:01.301 --> 15:02.669
THAT I DON'T WANT
TO BRING KIDS

15:02.702 --> 15:04.337
INTO THIS SCREWED-UP WORLD.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.006
OKAY? BUT LOOK--
I'M SORRY TOO.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.641
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE KIDS,
THEN FINE, YOU WIN.

15:08.675 --> 15:11.078
LET'S HAVE A [bleep]IN' KID!

15:13.046 --> 15:14.581
DO YOU MEAN IT?
YOU WANT TO HAVE A KID?

15:14.614 --> 15:17.317
[sighs]

15:17.350 --> 15:19.419
I HATE MY LIFE.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.454
SO CAN WE COME IN?

15:28.228 --> 15:30.463
MMM. MMM.

15:30.497 --> 15:34.234
GREAT TURKEY LEG.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.702
[voice breaking]
OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA CHECK
ON DINNER.

15:35.735 --> 15:38.238
[chair scrapes loudly]

15:40.273 --> 15:42.375
ANGELA, WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME OF MY BEET SALAD?

15:42.409 --> 15:44.577
I HATE BEET SALAD.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.079
IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.247
HEY, HEY, HEY.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.249
I KNOW YOU LOVE
BEET SALAD.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.251
I'VE SEEN YOU EAT IT
MANY TIMES.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.253
THE THOUGHT OF POPPING
ONE OF YOUR BEETS INTO MY MOUTH

15:53.286 --> 15:54.554
MAKES ME WANT TO VOMIT.

15:54.587 --> 15:58.725
[whispering]
PAM.

15:58.758 --> 16:01.228
I HOPE SHE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
TO THE FOOD.

16:01.261 --> 16:04.097
[whispering]
LIKE--LIKE WHAT?

16:04.131 --> 16:05.565
I CAN'T PROVE IT,

16:05.598 --> 16:08.268
BUT I THINK SHE MIGHT BE
TRYING TO POISON ME.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.243
(Michael)
HEY, LOOKS GREAT, BABE.
YEAH, IT REALLY DOES.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.511
[whispering]
I KNOW JAN DIDN'T POISON
THE FOOD.

16:18.545 --> 16:19.746
I KNOW THAT.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.115
BUT IF SHE WAS GOING TO POISON
THE FOOD

16:22.149 --> 16:23.283
OF SOMEONE AT THAT TABLE,

16:23.316 --> 16:25.152
WOULDN'T IT BE ME?

16:25.185 --> 16:27.420
MICHAEL'S FORMER LOVER.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.729
CAN YOU NOT DO THAT?
IT'S DISGUSTING.

16:38.765 --> 16:41.434
YOU KNOW I HAVE SOFT TEETH.
HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT?

16:41.468 --> 16:43.070
OOPS.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.205
[loud clatter]

16:45.238 --> 16:47.640
EXCUSE ME FOR A SECOND.

16:51.811 --> 16:53.680
SO...

16:53.713 --> 16:55.482
HOW DO YOU GUYS
KNOW EACH OTHER?

16:55.515 --> 16:58.485
I WAS HIS BABYSITTER.

16:58.518 --> 17:01.254
AND NOW YOU GUYS
ARE DATING?

17:01.288 --> 17:04.291
IT'S PURELY CARNAL, AND THAT'S
ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW.

17:04.324 --> 17:05.692
WOULD YOU WRITE DOWN
YOUR EMAIL?

17:05.725 --> 17:08.795
BECAUSE I HAVE JUST
SO MANY QUESTIONS.

17:08.828 --> 17:10.297
EMAIL?

17:10.330 --> 17:12.432
NEVER MIND.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.167
OKAY.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.603

EVERYBODY ENJOYING

17:33.853 --> 17:36.656
[neon humming]

17:36.689 --> 17:38.158
HEY, BABE.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.259
HOW 'BOUT WE TAKE
THE BEER SIGN DOWN

17:39.292 --> 17:41.428
UNTIL OUR GUESTS LEAVE,
AND THEN WE CAN DISCUSS IT?

17:41.461 --> 17:44.264
NO. NO.
I'M GONNA LEAVE IT UP.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.833
I THINK IT TIES
THE WHOLE ROOM TOGETHER.

17:46.866 --> 17:50.237
OKAY.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.207
[loud music]
* YOU TOOK ME BY THE HAND

17:54.241 --> 17:56.843

JAN THINKS HUNTER'S
VERY TALENTED.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.511
(Michael)
YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:58.545 --> 18:00.680
I DON'T THINK
HE'S THAT GOOD.

18:00.713 --> 18:02.515
AT LEAST HE'S AN ARTIST.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.651

18:04.684 --> 18:06.353

18:15.395 --> 18:17.530

18:17.564 --> 18:19.366

18:19.399 --> 18:22.135
OH, GOOD, I'LL BE
YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER!

18:22.169 --> 18:23.436
YOU'RE HARDLY MY FIRST.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.772
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!

18:25.805 --> 18:27.840

18:57.204 --> 18:58.205
IT'S GETTING LATE.
YEAH.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.339
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU GUYS,

18:59.372 --> 19:00.340
SHE'LL BE OUT
OF THE BATHROOM SOON.

19:00.373 --> 19:02.942
OF COURSE.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.344
(Dwight)
UH, UH, UH,

19:04.377 --> 19:05.278
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.647
OKAY, WHAT SEEMS TO BE
THE PROBLEM, OFFICERS?

19:07.680 --> 19:08.448
NOT NOW, DWIGHT.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.350
WE GOT A CALL
ABOUT A DISTURBANCE.

19:10.383 --> 19:11.651
NO. NOPE.

19:11.684 --> 19:12.652
NOTHING DISTURBING HERE.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.487
JUST A COUPLE OF FRIENDS

19:14.521 --> 19:15.822
HAVING AN AWESOME
DINNER PARTY.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.357
YOUR NEIGHBORS SAY
THEY HEARD SOME SHOUTING.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.392
OH, YES,
THERE WAS SCREAMING,

19:19.426 --> 19:21.228
BUT, UM--

19:21.261 --> 19:24.664
MY GIRLFRIEND THREW A DUNDIE
AT MY TV.

19:24.697 --> 19:25.798
A PLASMA.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.500
DO YOU WANT
TO PRESS CHARGES?

19:27.534 --> 19:28.835
WOULD SHE GET
INTO TROUBLE?

19:28.868 --> 19:30.603
YEAH, SHE'D BE CHARGED.

19:30.637 --> 19:33.440
I WILL TAKE THE FALL.

19:33.473 --> 19:34.641
I DID IT.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.476
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO PRESS CHARGES.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.345
YOU COULD JUST TRY
TO BE MORE QUIET.

19:38.378 --> 19:39.912
MICHAEL!
YES.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.314
MICHAEL.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.884
SIR, DO YOU HAVE
ANY OTHER PLACE YOU COULD STAY?

19:44.917 --> 19:47.654
MAYBE WITH ONE
OF YOUR FRIENDS HERE?

19:47.687 --> 19:52.325
MICHAEL CAN COME HOME

19:52.359 --> 19:53.660
JIM, PAM?

19:53.693 --> 19:54.994
OH, MY APARTMENT'S ON FIRE.
