WEBVTT

01:50.653 --> 01:51.862
It's the beginning.

01:52.738 --> 01:53.739
He said it.

01:54.907 --> 01:56.617
Before the beginning.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.577
Huh? Who's there?

02:00.955 --> 02:04.333
My lab. Something happened.

02:06.919 --> 02:09.046
And I'm so hungry.

02:19.598 --> 02:22.852
- Uh, let's see, I'll have the--
- Sausage and peas,

02:22.852 --> 02:27.064
French fries, white toast,
apple pie and coffee.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.694
You ordered a while ago,
and I wasn't about to forget

02:31.694 --> 02:33.696
that culinary curiosity.

02:35.406 --> 02:36.574
Iris.

02:37.908 --> 02:40.160
That's what
the name badge says.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.204
- Here you go--
- Oh, Iris!

02:52.423 --> 02:53.841
Huh? What?

02:58.012 --> 03:00.222
What just happened?

03:00.222 --> 03:03.017
What was supposed
to happen here. We met.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.312
I've been working too hard.

03:07.605 --> 03:08.898
Hey, you should sit down.

03:13.819 --> 03:15.738
- Is this okay?

03:15.738 --> 03:17.364
I don't want to get you fired.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.365
Doesn't matter.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.367
Today is my last day.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.870
I've just been
picking up shifts here
till my ship came in.

03:22.870 --> 03:23.871
Where are you going?

03:23.871 --> 03:25.539
I landed my dream job.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.625
- GBS News.
- You're a reporter?

03:27.625 --> 03:29.585
News writer. For now.

03:29.585 --> 03:33.297
- But maybe someday. Who knows?

03:33.297 --> 03:36.091
Oh, you'll make it.
I'm sure of it.

03:36.091 --> 03:37.593
I'm Barry Allen, by the way.

03:38.636 --> 03:40.346
Look, this may sound crazy,

03:40.346 --> 03:42.765
but would you like
to go out for lunch?

03:43.849 --> 03:46.018
Barry Allen.

03:46.018 --> 03:47.686
You're already out to lunch.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.397
Well, we could split this.

03:54.276 --> 03:55.945
Flash.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.530
Flash.

03:59.365 --> 04:00.991
Get up.

04:02.159 --> 04:03.452
Get up.

04:04.787 --> 04:06.664
No!

04:06.664 --> 04:07.998
-  You need to get up.
-  Come on,
Flash, get up.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.583
-  Please.
-  We need you.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.502
- You can do it.
- Get up, Flash.

04:11.502 --> 04:12.711
Get up!

04:12.711 --> 04:14.380
Please don't do this.

04:14.380 --> 04:16.590
You weren't programmed to harm.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.178
Get up. Get up, Flash.

04:23.472 --> 04:25.683
The Flash. I'm the Flash.

04:36.986 --> 04:38.779
Superman?

04:38.779 --> 04:41.365
Looks like that last blast
rattled your cage a bit.

04:41.365 --> 04:42.908
You'd better sit this one out.

04:42.908 --> 04:44.159
I can handle this.

04:48.205 --> 04:49.206
Whatever he is.

04:49.707 --> 04:51.250
Android.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.585
He's an android.
I remember now.

04:53.585 --> 04:54.670
Amazo.

04:55.671 --> 04:56.964
Amazo?

04:56.964 --> 04:58.132
- How do you know its--
- I don't know.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.427
Okay, fine.

05:01.427 --> 05:03.470
I'll take care of Amazo.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.764
No. No, don't.

05:18.610 --> 05:19.945
Ahhh!

05:30.456 --> 05:31.749
Weak.

05:31.749 --> 05:34.043
I'm not weak.
You're just heavy.

05:34.043 --> 05:35.753
Oh, you mean you're weak?

05:35.753 --> 05:39.715
That android,
he somehow drained my power.

05:40.632 --> 05:41.967
Like Parasite.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.343
Yeah, me too.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.345
But I think you got
the worst of it.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.472
Oh, no.

05:53.896 --> 05:55.731
Help me over there.

05:55.731 --> 05:58.358
- I'll just...
- I hope it's not
your birthday, pal,

05:58.358 --> 05:59.985
'cause you couldn't
blow out a candle.

05:59.985 --> 06:02.654
- I'll draw him away.
- Flash, no.

06:02.654 --> 06:04.531
He drained the energy
out of me.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.617
- If he gets yours...
- Don't worry.

06:06.617 --> 06:08.327
I'll keep my distance

06:26.095 --> 06:27.846
- You all right?

06:27.846 --> 06:29.932
Well, I got some speed left,
but not enough for,

06:29.932 --> 06:31.683
you know,
a tornado or anything.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.811
- You better get out of here.
- I'm not leaving you here.

06:44.488 --> 06:46.824
Come on. That won't
slow him down for long.

06:46.824 --> 06:49.118
Whoa. I know you.

06:49.118 --> 06:50.953
- Robin Hood.
- Not Robin Hood.

06:50.953 --> 06:52.454
Hmm. You're dressed like him.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.248
Robin Hood doesn't have a car.

07:03.048 --> 07:04.550
He needs medical attention.

07:04.550 --> 07:05.634
S.T.A.R. Labs, maybe.

07:07.553 --> 07:09.888
No. No S.T.A.R. Labs.

07:09.888 --> 07:12.975
Yeah, I think
they're a little bit
too alien dissection-y.

07:12.975 --> 07:14.226
Where else?

07:14.226 --> 07:16.520
I have a friend.

07:24.528 --> 07:26.280
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

07:28.448 --> 07:30.784
Well, it is Halloween.

07:35.873 --> 07:37.457
It's for you, sir.

07:41.170 --> 07:43.881
- Trick or treat
- Bruce Wayne?

07:43.881 --> 07:46.049
I thought this address
was familiar, but...

07:47.217 --> 07:48.802
Hello, Ollie.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.096
And you're Barry Allen.

07:51.096 --> 07:53.891
A forensic scientist
from Central City.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.895
Wow. How did you--

07:57.895 --> 08:00.731
We have a friend of yours.
He gave us your address.

08:06.195 --> 08:07.487
Bring him inside.

08:18.582 --> 08:20.626
-  Earth to Barry.
- Huh?

08:22.211 --> 08:24.004
The flowers.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.465
What kind of flowers
should we have
at the reception?

08:26.465 --> 08:27.841
Irises.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.719
We had irises on
every table. Will have.

08:30.719 --> 08:33.931
I mean, it would look nice
if we have irises
on every table.

08:33.931 --> 08:36.558
You were time tripping again.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.310
Quality time is my
love language.

08:38.310 --> 08:40.520
And here,
you were in another era.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.605
No, I wasn't--

08:42.606 --> 08:44.900
Yeah. I was.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.693
Just before the
Justice League formed.

08:48.237 --> 08:50.155
You know, there are other ways
to help people

08:50.155 --> 08:53.283
without risking your life
all the time.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.160
Why don't you help him?

08:55.160 --> 08:58.121
- Here.
- Uh. Hey, mister.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.749
Here. Why don't you get
yourself something to eat?

09:02.626 --> 09:05.462
The worlds are ending.

09:06.922 --> 09:08.215
Really? Which ones?

09:09.508 --> 09:11.134
All of them.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.607
Uh, I'm coming.

09:28.735 --> 09:29.861
Hello.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.072
Barry.

09:34.199 --> 09:37.452
Oh, Bruce.
I hardly recognized you.

09:37.452 --> 09:39.746
I'm so used to seeing you
with all the stuff on.

09:45.168 --> 09:47.045
Come in.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.797
Hey, sport. What's your name?

09:50.632 --> 09:51.633
Dick.

09:52.551 --> 09:53.927
I'm Barry.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.679
Uh, can I get you guys
anything to drink?

09:55.679 --> 10:00.434
Some grape soda,
or Iris left something
called kombucha?

10:00.434 --> 10:01.643
Maybe it's tea?

10:01.643 --> 10:02.978
No, thanks.

10:02.978 --> 10:04.980
- I'm good.
- Uh...

10:04.980 --> 10:07.399
You know, my nephew
Wally's about your age.

10:07.399 --> 10:09.526
He's playing video games
down in the basement.

10:09.526 --> 10:10.610
Introduce yourself.

10:11.987 --> 10:12.988
Can I?

10:17.868 --> 10:20.620
He just lost both his parents.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.414
Circus accident outside Gotham.

10:23.415 --> 10:24.666
Not really an accident.

10:26.376 --> 10:27.836
Oh, I heard about that.

10:28.754 --> 10:30.839
Poor kid.

10:30.839 --> 10:33.383
You have connections with
the Central City Orphanage.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.846
Yeah, I volunteer there. Why?

10:37.846 --> 10:39.973
I can't put him
in the system in Gotham.

10:39.973 --> 10:43.143
Social services there
is not optimum.

10:44.519 --> 10:45.687
I see.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.568
Bruce, have you
thought this out?

10:53.528 --> 10:55.280
Yes. That's what I do.

10:56.865 --> 11:00.452
Right. Look.
I may be way out of line here,

11:00.452 --> 11:03.372
but he seems
comfortable with you.

11:03.372 --> 11:05.499
You have means.
Plenty of room.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.918
- Have you considered maybe--
-  What?

11:07.918 --> 11:09.586
Fostering him?

11:09.586 --> 11:12.756
It's too dangerous.
You know what my life is like.

11:12.756 --> 11:15.425
Bruce, he's a tightrope walker
or something.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.344
He'll probably be
safer with you.

11:18.929 --> 11:21.848
My mission demands
100% commitment.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.559
Doesn't leave much time
left over for a kid.

11:24.559 --> 11:27.896
Well, you should make time.
It'd be good for him.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.481
Good for the mission.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.274
But most of all,
it'd be good for you.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.320
I didn't come here
for a lecture.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.822
Now, are you going
to help me or not?

11:50.752 --> 11:52.003
Is he going to die?

11:53.588 --> 11:55.382
I'm not convinced he can die.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.052
His cells are starting
to bank energy.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.303
I think he'll be fine.

12:01.596 --> 12:03.849
So, you're the Batman?

12:03.849 --> 12:06.852
Is it the Batman
or just Batman?

12:06.852 --> 12:09.980
When was the last time
he was conscious?

12:09.980 --> 12:12.732
He passed out right after
giving us your address.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.109
Thanks for understanding.

12:14.109 --> 12:15.652
I was kind of afraid
you'd be angry.

12:17.028 --> 12:18.572
What makes you think I'm not?

12:19.906 --> 12:22.117
So, how long did it take?

12:22.117 --> 12:24.619
Figuring out
my secret identity?

12:24.619 --> 12:26.371
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

12:38.842 --> 12:40.594
Yeah, well, I would have
figured out yours too.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.388
Eventually.

12:43.388 --> 12:45.098
- Clearly, proximity
to the android

12:45.098 --> 12:49.019
allows him to absorb
and store supernormal energy.

12:49.019 --> 12:52.105
Some of yours.
Most of his.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.357
Destroying him
may be a challenge.

12:54.357 --> 12:55.942
You think it'll come to that?

12:55.942 --> 12:58.069
We'll have to destroy Amazo?

12:58.069 --> 13:00.197
The android.

13:00.197 --> 13:02.449
I mean, it didn't seem like
he knew he was doing
anything wrong.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.326
In fact, he looked sad
when that old guy

13:04.326 --> 13:05.452
gave him a talking to.

13:07.579 --> 13:12.125
 Dr. Anthony Ivo,
multiple PhDs,
Nairobi University.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.169
Metropolis Institute
of Technology.

13:14.169 --> 13:15.670
Quantum Energy Mechanics.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.589
AI, robotics.

13:17.589 --> 13:20.008
 I know this guy.
Real eccentric.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.635
Brilliant, obviously.

13:21.635 --> 13:24.596
I tried to hire him,
but Luthor poached him away.

13:24.596 --> 13:28.308
LexCorp reported him missing
three weeks ago.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.518
I wonder what he's got.

13:30.352 --> 13:32.103
Oh, this twitch.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.856
It's often a symptom
of nerve cell degeneration.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.650
Yeah, or carpal
tunnel syndrome.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.652
Whatever.

13:38.652 --> 13:41.613
The point is, there is a super powerful
giant robot out there. And what are we
going to do about it?

13:43.323 --> 13:44.908
Based on its abilities,

13:44.908 --> 13:47.035
I suspect that this pointless
attack in Metropolis

13:47.035 --> 13:50.497
- was just subterfuge.
- Distracting us from what?

13:50.497 --> 13:52.415
I don't know.

13:52.415 --> 13:55.335
But whatever that is,
we'll have to wait
until morning.

14:01.758 --> 14:04.386
I brewed a particularly
strong blend, sir.

14:04.386 --> 14:06.221
Just what I needed, Alfred.

14:06.221 --> 14:08.515
Apparently, I'm going to need
about ten million of these.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.310
This should help you
more than the coffee.

14:13.937 --> 14:16.856
Bruce, I'm sorry
about all of this.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.441
I didn't know where else to go.

14:18.441 --> 14:20.485
Relax.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.279
It's not like
he's gonna kill us to keep
his identity secret.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.364
You're not, right?

14:28.994 --> 14:30.704
Look, we should know
each other's identities

14:30.704 --> 14:32.789
if we're going to be
a team anyway, right?

14:32.789 --> 14:34.916
- What?
- Well, for months,

14:34.916 --> 14:40.005
Flash has been nagging me
to form some kind of
secret superhero club.

14:42.132 --> 14:46.553
Yeah, I saw
it worked great on...
Well, on a parallel Earth.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.222
Even ignoring that last part,

14:49.222 --> 14:52.058
it is a terrible idea.
I'm a loner.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.852
It is a terrible idea.

14:53.852 --> 14:58.148
Nevertheless, it's exactly
what we're going to do.

14:58.148 --> 15:01.276
The four of us are forming
some kind of super team?

15:03.153 --> 15:04.279
No.

15:04.279 --> 15:06.615
Not just the four of us.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.429
You're kidding, right?

16:52.429 --> 16:53.930
I'm already on a team.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.598
It's called
the Green Lantern Corps.

16:56.307 --> 16:57.308
I'll pass.

17:00.145 --> 17:02.605
What a jerk!
That guy is the worst.

17:02.605 --> 17:03.690
We have enough.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.531
You must believe.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.952
You must bear witness.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.038
Ahhh!

17:31.050 --> 17:32.927
Oops. My bad.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.185
Hey! It's okay. I--

17:55.867 --> 17:58.411
Toto, I have a feeling
we're not
in Central City anymore.

17:59.996 --> 18:03.041
Except I am in Central City.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.002
Argh! I did it again.

18:07.545 --> 18:08.838
No.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.423
I didn't.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.550
That homeless guy,
he did something to me.

18:12.550 --> 18:14.469
He sent me here.

18:14.469 --> 18:16.763
No tanks. No Nazis.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.723
Well, maybe Nazis.

18:19.849 --> 18:22.393
I dub thee Earth-3.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.564
Okay. This looks more familiar.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.608
Speedster. Bank robbery.

18:28.608 --> 18:29.901
Maybe I can help
this world's Flash.

18:43.039 --> 18:46.918
Well, look who we have here.
A regular zippy Rodriguez.

18:46.918 --> 18:49.045
Pretty sure you mean
Speedy Gonzales,

18:49.045 --> 18:52.715
and where I come from,
we look down on stealing,
crime and supervillains.

18:52.715 --> 18:55.051
Okay, then you sure aren't
from around here, mate.

18:55.051 --> 18:56.427
Because that's not stealing.

18:56.427 --> 18:57.846
That's just how things
get done now.

18:57.846 --> 18:59.514
The Syndicate's become
the government.

18:59.514 --> 19:01.891
Whatever. If you don't mind,
I need to give this back.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.059
Now, hold up, mate!

19:09.774 --> 19:11.442
Crikey, it's like running
with cement in my shoes.

19:11.442 --> 19:13.361
You're using up
half my Speed Force.

19:13.361 --> 19:16.197
Funny, I feel faster
than usual.

19:16.197 --> 19:19.158
 Yeah, that's 'cause
I killed every other speedster
on this planet.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.243
How do you not know that?

19:21.911 --> 19:24.038
What now?

19:24.038 --> 19:25.874
Offed 'em. With a little help
from the rest
of the Crime Syndicate.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.376
Crime Syndicate?

19:28.376 --> 19:30.336
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's just for
old times' sake.

19:30.336 --> 19:33.882
What we really are is
the worldwide
absolute government.

19:33.882 --> 19:35.008
Sounds pretty cool, eh?

19:37.260 --> 19:39.220
That'd be them now.
They tend to notice
when I'm late with the money.

19:41.556 --> 19:44.309
We got Power Ring, Owlman,

19:45.685 --> 19:49.355
Superwoman and Ultraman.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.566
I'm Johnny Quick, by the way.
I'd introduce you,

19:51.566 --> 19:53.943
but...
You'll be too busy being dead.

20:07.582 --> 20:11.169
How would you like
to die, speedster?

20:11.169 --> 20:13.379
Old age.

20:23.973 --> 20:27.226
Not only are we thrilled
that this fine city
would welcome

20:27.226 --> 20:29.395
our newly formed
team of heroes,

20:29.395 --> 20:32.357
but that it would give us
the opportunity to renovate

20:32.357 --> 20:36.986
its beloved Metropolis
Terminal station
as our headquarters.

20:36.986 --> 20:38.363
- Our new home.

20:52.710 --> 20:55.672
- Why here?
- I picked it up for a song.

20:55.672 --> 20:58.216
And this courtyard
offers easy egress.

21:00.134 --> 21:04.889
Martian Manhunter, Vixen,
Green Arrow, Flash,

21:04.889 --> 21:08.643
Batman and myself
could not be more thrilled
or humbled

21:08.643 --> 21:11.020
at your trust
and confidence in us.

21:11.020 --> 21:12.522
But I'd be remiss

21:12.522 --> 21:14.357
if I didn't mention
that this is all truly

21:14.357 --> 21:17.944
due to the efforts
of Central City's
Scarlet Speedster,

21:17.944 --> 21:19.988
- the Flash.

21:29.205 --> 21:30.331
Oh, uh...

21:30.331 --> 21:31.833
Yeah, thank you, Superman.

21:32.667 --> 21:33.918
Yes.

21:33.918 --> 21:36.796
And I suppose you'd like
to perhaps reveal

21:36.796 --> 21:41.300
the name of this exciting
first-ever super team...

21:41.300 --> 21:42.552
right now.

21:44.137 --> 21:45.596
Right, Flash?

21:45.596 --> 21:48.182
The name.
Yeah, of the team, yes.

21:48.182 --> 21:53.062
Yes, it's...
It is the Justice Syn...

21:54.605 --> 21:55.773
League.

21:57.191 --> 21:58.568
The Justice League.

22:04.449 --> 22:05.700
Oh, crap.

22:38.733 --> 22:42.403
Warning.
There's a shard of wood headed
for the Green Arrow's head.

22:42.403 --> 22:43.529
On it.

22:45.114 --> 22:47.241
Wait. Who's talking to me?

22:47.241 --> 22:51.704
I've absorbed ample energy
to allow communication
at excessive speeds.

22:51.704 --> 22:54.248
Okay, skipping over
the inherent weirdness...

22:54.248 --> 22:56.042
Why are you doing this?

22:56.042 --> 22:58.461
A projectile
endangers Batman.

22:58.461 --> 23:00.254
Please clarify your inquiry.

23:00.254 --> 23:02.340
Why do you show concern
for our safety

23:02.340 --> 23:04.717
while you're in the middle
of an attack on us?

23:04.717 --> 23:06.302
Faulty interpretation.

23:06.302 --> 23:09.055
Attack is contrary
to primary function.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.681
What is your primary function?

23:10.681 --> 23:13.851
Primary function
designated by Professor Ivo

23:13.851 --> 23:16.187
is to prolong
and improve human life.

23:16.187 --> 23:19.899
Draining Superman will not
prolong or improve his life.

23:25.947 --> 23:30.034
New mission parameters indicate
that Superman is not human.

23:30.034 --> 23:32.411
You're endangering
all of these lives.

23:32.411 --> 23:33.913
You didn't do that last time.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.540
You were careful.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.750
What happened?
What is Ivo telling you now?

23:39.961 --> 23:43.840
Mission parameters have been
amended by New Best Friend.

24:07.864 --> 24:10.324
Your "new best friend,"
I presume.

24:10.324 --> 24:14.245
- Ah. Thank you, Justice League.

24:18.875 --> 24:22.211
Prioritize integration
of Superman's energy.

24:22.211 --> 24:26.048
Sensors indicate
Superman's vital signs
are precarious.

24:26.048 --> 24:29.677
This is inconsistent
with my programming.

24:29.677 --> 24:31.137
I believe you'll
find my orders

24:31.137 --> 24:33.973
are compliant with
new code I provided.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.099
<i>Now, do it!</i>

25:06.130 --> 25:08.633
Luthor's battle suit
complicates this situation.

25:22.188 --> 25:25.149
What are you doing?
You're calling in an airstrike?

25:25.149 --> 25:27.401
It's our best option.

25:27.401 --> 25:32.531
Turning downtown Metropolis
into a war zone cannot
be the best option.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.033
We have to act now,

25:34.033 --> 25:36.535
while Flash still retains
some of his speed.

25:36.535 --> 25:37.578
He can clear before--

25:37.578 --> 25:39.121
You start dropping bombs?

25:40.331 --> 25:41.624
It's too dangerous.

25:41.624 --> 25:44.043
- The civilians...
- Will be cleared out.

25:44.043 --> 25:47.255
We have to destroy that AI
before it gets too powerful.

25:47.255 --> 25:50.091
Don't confuse weakness
with compassion.

25:50.091 --> 25:53.386
You're the one who's confusing
brutality for strength.

25:53.386 --> 25:56.138
Confused. That's what Amazo is.

25:56.138 --> 25:58.891
What he needs is...
Wait right here.

26:32.258 --> 26:33.259
Incredible.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.682
Where am I?

26:39.682 --> 26:42.893
You're in
the Hall of Crime, idiot.

26:44.520 --> 26:47.815
And we do the questioning here.

26:47.815 --> 26:51.819
Who the hell are you
and where do you come from?

26:51.819 --> 26:54.405
I'm...
called the Flash.

26:54.405 --> 26:55.573
I'm a crime fighter.

26:55.573 --> 26:57.575
I'm not from your world.

26:57.575 --> 26:59.618
I'm from a parallel Earth.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.871
What a load of crap.

27:01.871 --> 27:03.914
Whoever he is,
he's a speedster.

27:03.914 --> 27:06.751
As soon as he showed up,
my access to the Speed Force
cut in half.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.712
I'm already bored.

27:09.712 --> 27:13.049
Superwoman, can we move on
to the part I still like?

27:13.049 --> 27:14.175
By all means.

27:15.509 --> 27:18.095
Oh. Lasso of Truth. Fine.

27:19.388 --> 27:22.641
Lasso of Truth?

27:22.641 --> 27:23.976
Not quite.

27:23.976 --> 27:28.189
This is my Lasso of Submission.

27:30.399 --> 27:32.234
That's better.

27:32.234 --> 27:33.778
Tell me if you're lying.

27:33.778 --> 27:36.781
 No. No, it's true.

27:36.781 --> 27:37.865
- Talk!

27:37.865 --> 27:39.367
It's true!

27:39.367 --> 27:41.744
- He's telling the truth.

27:43.579 --> 27:44.580
Interesting.

27:46.165 --> 27:48.876
Would you shut that thing off?

27:48.876 --> 27:50.002
Ultra hearing.

27:53.923 --> 27:55.591
What a load of crap.

27:55.591 --> 27:58.010
Perhaps not.

27:58.010 --> 28:02.348
Our nemesis, Alexander Luthor,
theorized about such worlds.

28:03.307 --> 28:04.725
Oh, Luthor.

28:04.725 --> 28:06.977
Of course you'd have
one of him here too.

28:06.977 --> 28:09.105
So he must be
some kind of hero?

28:10.356 --> 28:11.774
He thought so.

28:11.774 --> 28:13.359
He stood in our way.

28:21.575 --> 28:23.702
None of this makes any sense.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.246
You rule this planet.

28:25.246 --> 28:27.164
How can you be the government
and criminals?

28:27.164 --> 28:28.999
-  Ha!

28:31.585 --> 28:34.422
Look at you.
You own everyone
and everything.

28:34.422 --> 28:37.716
But I've never seen a more
miserable group in my life.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.552
You're right.

28:41.011 --> 28:42.596
We're bored.

28:42.596 --> 28:47.393
But you've given us
a precious gift. A challenge.

28:47.393 --> 28:50.813
A new world to conquer.
Armies to crush.

28:50.813 --> 28:53.566
Superbeings to slaughter.

28:53.566 --> 28:57.528
Billions of people to enslave.
A reason to fight.

28:58.195 --> 28:59.196
To live.

29:02.950 --> 29:05.077
- Bring us there.

29:07.037 --> 29:08.330
Uh, oh, hey, hey, hey. Hold up.

29:08.330 --> 29:09.832
I don't think he can.

29:09.832 --> 29:11.792
His problem,
we share the same Speed Force.

29:11.792 --> 29:13.419
It slows us both.

29:13.419 --> 29:16.005
So all we have to do
is kill one of you,

29:16.005 --> 29:18.174
and the other one
is fast enough.

29:18.174 --> 29:21.177
- Oh, hey. Look, mate.

29:21.177 --> 29:24.930
I don't know how to do it,
so just don't kill him yet.

29:24.930 --> 29:27.141
-  No.

29:31.479 --> 29:32.730
He lives.

29:33.522 --> 29:34.565
What the hell?

29:38.194 --> 29:41.906
It's that beggar
who never shuts up
about the end of the world.

29:43.157 --> 29:44.992
Guess you're in a hurry to die.

29:45.576 --> 29:46.577
Kill him.

29:51.707 --> 29:54.543
I have tried. Can't.

30:01.383 --> 30:02.718
What's this?

30:07.348 --> 30:08.557
The end.

30:21.529 --> 30:23.489
Hold still.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.824
John, you're in a tuxedo.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.451
Uh, very observant.

30:27.451 --> 30:29.578
You know, I sometimes forget
you're a detective.

30:29.578 --> 30:31.997
Wally, slow down.
That's got to last
the whole reception.

30:38.629 --> 30:40.422
It's my wedding day.

30:40.422 --> 30:42.049
You're my best man.

30:42.049 --> 30:44.510
You really have a gift
for being in the moment.

30:45.261 --> 30:46.720
I remember.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.305
Clark and Bruce are
on another planet.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.432
J'onn too.

30:50.432 --> 30:52.101
Uh, I gotta talk to Iris.

30:52.101 --> 30:54.812
It's bad luck to see the bride
before the ceremony.

31:01.986 --> 31:04.947
Oh, Lois. Hi.

31:04.947 --> 31:07.866
That's right.
You're Iris' maid of honor.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.911
I see John
got you here on time.

31:10.911 --> 31:12.329
There's another bet I lost.

31:13.539 --> 31:14.832
Look, I got to see Iris.

31:14.832 --> 31:17.084
- Barry. It's bad lu--
- Luck. I know.

31:17.084 --> 31:18.168
Not this time.

31:19.545 --> 31:21.005
Iris?

31:21.005 --> 31:23.048
We've never done life
the normal way.

31:23.048 --> 31:24.550
Why start now?

31:31.015 --> 31:32.683
Wow.

31:32.683 --> 31:35.686
Finally, you say
the right thing.

31:36.604 --> 31:38.022
Now, what's up?

31:38.022 --> 31:39.440
I need to
tell you something.

31:40.691 --> 31:43.027
I need to tell you
about the Flash.

31:43.027 --> 31:44.987
You mean Jay Garrick?

31:44.987 --> 31:47.823
Look, when I came back
from Earth-3
with all its Speed Force,

31:47.823 --> 31:50.701
my whole life
flashed before my eyes.

31:50.701 --> 31:54.371
And I've been bouncing
back and forth between
moments in my life.

31:54.371 --> 31:58.584
I never know where I am,
but I know something's
about to happen.

32:00.669 --> 32:01.795
What's going to happen?

32:03.047 --> 32:05.716
I only half remember it,
but...

32:05.716 --> 32:08.218
But it always happens
the day we get married.

32:09.345 --> 32:11.639
Something major.

32:41.085 --> 32:42.378
You found me.

32:47.508 --> 32:50.052
Ivo. You're Anthony Ivo.

32:50.052 --> 32:52.304
Yes. We must go.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.390
Luthor has control
of my android.

32:55.307 --> 32:58.936
Your android. Amazo.

32:58.936 --> 33:03.565
He is a threat to you,
and Superman,
and all like you.

33:03.565 --> 33:06.193
You have to take me
to him. Quickly.

33:10.531 --> 33:13.033
Your file says you're 39.

33:13.033 --> 33:14.743
You have
Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome.

33:16.036 --> 33:17.996
Accelerated ageing.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.082
You must be a doctor.

33:20.082 --> 33:22.042
Well, PhD, not a medical...

33:22.042 --> 33:24.002
Look, I can't speed you there.

33:24.002 --> 33:27.589
- In your condition--
- My condition is what
started this.

33:30.509 --> 33:33.887
<i>I'd been working on
quantum energy
absorption technology</i>

33:33.887 --> 33:38.517
<i>for LexCorp for years
when I discovered
I was dying.</i>

33:38.517 --> 33:43.564
<i>This hyper-aging disease
killing me, eating me alive.</i>

33:43.564 --> 33:49.111
<i>Lex encouraged me to fight.
To use my intellect
to prolong my life</i>

33:49.111 --> 33:51.363
<i>and share that miracle
with others.</i>

34:01.457 --> 34:04.877
<i>Lex had access
to extraterrestrial technology</i>

34:04.877 --> 34:07.546
<i>that created
the Parasite creature.</i>

34:07.546 --> 34:13.010
<i>And he reasoned
if we could syphon energy off
newly appearing metahumans,</i>

34:13.010 --> 34:17.598
<i>we could use it to supercharge
the immune systems
of regular people.</i>

34:23.854 --> 34:28.317
<i>I was already designing
an AI PTO to be
a perfect battery.</i>

34:30.235 --> 34:32.279
<i>It's virtually indestructible.</i>

34:34.656 --> 34:36.200
Didn't you,
I don't know,

34:36.200 --> 34:39.119
think twice before making
an indestructible android?

34:39.119 --> 34:43.832
I printed my own engrams
on the AI's neuro network.

34:43.832 --> 34:47.002
He would never
knowingly hurt others.

34:47.002 --> 34:48.879
He only wants to help.

34:48.879 --> 34:51.965
Lex has
reprogrammed him somehow.

34:51.965 --> 34:53.383
Well, for someone
who wants to help,

34:53.383 --> 34:54.968
he's doing an
awful lot of hurting.

36:36.361 --> 36:38.530
What am I doing?
I got to get out
there and help.

36:38.530 --> 36:39.990
This world...

36:40.782 --> 36:42.826
already dead.

36:42.826 --> 36:45.495
You're a regular Sadie Sunbeam,
aren't you?

36:45.495 --> 36:48.540
I saw you in my world.

36:48.540 --> 36:52.461
I walk all worlds
that are doomed to die.

36:53.253 --> 36:54.630
My punishment.

36:56.423 --> 36:59.259
For what?
What did you do?

36:59.259 --> 37:03.430
So long... I don't remember.

37:03.430 --> 37:08.268
But I know you share my guilt.

37:27.955 --> 37:29.748
There's one behind you,
four o'clock.

37:42.803 --> 37:47.683
Friend,
the energy in these beings
runs dangerously low.

37:47.683 --> 37:49.518
Don't you worry
your pretty little
head about it.

37:49.518 --> 37:51.353
My word is sacrosanct, remember?

38:01.488 --> 38:03.490
Our superpowered friends
are just about dead.

38:03.490 --> 38:04.783
We can't keep this up
much longer.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.410
We won't have to.

38:06.410 --> 38:07.911
- My contingency plan is ready.

38:07.911 --> 38:09.705
Okay, but let's hold off
on going to Defcon 1.

38:27.055 --> 38:29.891
You can't imagine
I didn't anticipate that.

38:30.684 --> 38:32.394
Batman, is it?

38:32.394 --> 38:35.105
I knew every move you'd make
before I finished breakfast.

38:36.440 --> 38:39.568
Intelligence is my superpower.

38:44.656 --> 38:48.285
<i>Which is still a better power
than "bow and arrow."</i>

38:50.829 --> 38:53.665
I'm surprised that someone
with your mental acumen

38:53.665 --> 38:57.836
wouldn't see the obvious
necessity of depowering
these meta-freaks.

39:02.215 --> 39:03.508
Or did you?

39:04.760 --> 39:07.846
No matter. Drain them.

39:07.846 --> 39:11.641
<i>Drain the very last iota
of power from them.</i>

39:11.641 --> 39:14.311
Friend, this action
seems inconsistent

39:14.311 --> 39:16.188
- with my primary function.

39:17.439 --> 39:19.441
Priority override.

39:19.441 --> 39:21.109
Do it.

39:37.292 --> 39:41.797
What is your primary function?

39:41.797 --> 39:44.132
The preservation
and extension of human life

39:44.132 --> 39:47.094
by siphoning off the surplus
power of metahumans

39:47.094 --> 39:49.888
and its redistribution
to ailing humans.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.932
<i>Power to the people.</i>

39:51.932 --> 39:55.310
In this case,
your powers to
deserving people.

39:55.310 --> 39:57.604
Me.

39:57.604 --> 40:00.440
But you two have become
an irritation as well.

40:01.274 --> 40:02.567
Priority override.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.486
Maximum energy release
directed at...

40:05.112 --> 40:06.363
<i>these.</i>

40:13.245 --> 40:14.329
No.

40:18.208 --> 40:19.543
You must not.

40:19.543 --> 40:21.253
This action is wrong.

40:37.060 --> 40:40.021
I am pleased to see you
up and about, Professor.

40:40.021 --> 40:41.898
But surprised.

40:41.898 --> 40:44.776
The Friend said
you were too ill
to leave the infirmary.

40:44.776 --> 40:48.655
That you required the energy
we are collecting
to extend your life.

40:48.655 --> 40:51.658
He is not your friend.

40:51.658 --> 40:54.244
He gives faulty data.

40:54.244 --> 40:56.121
He lied to me as well.

40:56.121 --> 40:59.124
Told me you could extend life.

40:59.124 --> 41:03.461
I believed him.
I wanted to extend my own life.

41:03.461 --> 41:06.756
But you cannot give life,
only take.

41:12.179 --> 41:16.183
Priority override!
Destroy them all!

41:16.183 --> 41:17.893
<i>Your programming compels you!</i>

41:20.770 --> 41:21.938
Oh, crap.

41:36.912 --> 41:40.832
I cannot disobey an order
from a designated user.

41:40.832 --> 41:44.920
But... there is one order
that takes priority.

41:44.920 --> 41:49.090
I am dying, Amazo.
Your sensors will confirm this.

41:49.090 --> 41:53.678
Extend my life.
Release the meta-energy to me.

42:02.229 --> 42:04.314
What is happening?

42:04.314 --> 42:07.150
Transferring meta-energy
to creator.

42:31.299 --> 42:32.759
Professor Ivo.

42:32.759 --> 42:33.843
Are you unwell?

42:35.345 --> 42:36.346
He's dead.

42:38.765 --> 42:41.101
That is an
unacceptable outcome.

42:43.520 --> 42:46.022
Everything functioned
within expected parameters.

42:48.900 --> 42:53.863
Of course, Luthor had
no interest in preserving life.

42:53.863 --> 42:55.907
Only stealing your power.

42:57.492 --> 42:59.119
He was a great man.

42:59.119 --> 43:00.412
He died a hero.

43:03.248 --> 43:05.417
Enough of this.
Absorb their remaining energy

43:05.417 --> 43:07.711
and destroy anyone who attempts
to stop you.

43:07.711 --> 43:09.713
Amazo.

43:09.713 --> 43:12.716
What are odds against
contracting Hutchinson-Gilford
syndrome?

43:12.716 --> 43:15.385
Less than one in four million.

43:17.012 --> 43:19.806
Now, what are odds
that a genius like Ivo,

43:19.806 --> 43:25.812
who had the skill
to create you,
would contract that syndrome?

43:25.812 --> 43:30.859
The likelihood is far greater
that you infected Professor Ivo
with the disease

43:30.859 --> 43:33.153
to motivate him
to create this unit.

43:56.426 --> 43:58.762
You are not a friend.

43:58.762 --> 44:01.639
Your actions shortened
Professor Ivo's life.

44:01.639 --> 44:04.142
That is counter
to our primary function.

44:07.729 --> 44:11.691
Amazo, don't do this.
Professor Ivo wouldn't
want you to.

44:11.691 --> 44:15.570
He valued all human life.
Even this guy's.

44:15.570 --> 44:19.949
His final actions
indicate that he valued
metahuman life as well.

44:19.949 --> 44:21.326
Justice League,

44:21.326 --> 44:23.536
I return to you
everything I have taken.

44:37.592 --> 44:40.261
I feel my strength returning.

44:40.261 --> 44:42.138
It is over.

44:42.138 --> 44:45.850
That it is.
Especially for him.

44:54.442 --> 44:55.527
Amazo.

44:56.528 --> 44:58.655
I was built on a lie.

45:02.409 --> 45:06.204
I was unable to carry out
my primary function.

45:08.123 --> 45:09.499
He prolonged our lives.

45:10.500 --> 45:12.794
You saved us.

45:12.794 --> 45:18.133
I only saved you from me.

45:48.913 --> 45:50.999
I'm glad this worked
and everything,

45:50.999 --> 45:53.918
but I'm kind of sorry
this whole Justice League thing
was just a ruse.

45:53.918 --> 45:56.296
It doesn't have to be.

45:56.296 --> 45:59.215
I tried to anticipate
every possible outcome.

45:59.215 --> 46:01.509
How does that make me
any different than Luthor?

46:03.511 --> 46:05.472
There's strength
in different points of view.

46:06.181 --> 46:07.182
In teamwork.

46:09.350 --> 46:10.727
The Justice League, then?

46:14.981 --> 46:16.816
The Justice League.

46:16.816 --> 46:20.278
After all,
I already bought the building.

46:30.121 --> 46:32.790
<i>Barry! Wake up!</i>

46:48.932 --> 46:51.434
Okay.

46:51.434 --> 46:54.062
Get a move on.
Breakfast is ready.

47:13.206 --> 47:15.542
Oh. You made breakfast.

47:15.542 --> 47:17.335
Since when do you
make breakfast?

47:17.335 --> 47:19.170
Since it's our special day.

47:19.170 --> 47:20.838
It's our anniversary?

47:20.838 --> 47:22.799
Not exactly.

47:22.799 --> 47:24.008
Look what I made.

47:24.676 --> 47:25.927
Ugh.

47:25.927 --> 47:27.595
No offense.

47:27.595 --> 47:29.889
Sausage and peas,
French fries,

47:29.889 --> 47:33.851
white toast, apple pie
and coffee.

47:33.851 --> 47:35.728
I thought you were crazy.

47:35.728 --> 47:38.398
Oh, I think I was too.

47:38.398 --> 47:40.358
And today is the anniversary
of that day?

47:41.359 --> 47:42.402
How many years?

47:43.236 --> 47:45.113
Oh... who knows?

47:45.113 --> 47:47.282
But it was the best day
of my life.

47:48.408 --> 47:50.577
Oh. Mine too, honey.

47:52.078 --> 47:53.580
How everything turned out.

47:54.497 --> 47:55.748
No regrets?

47:55.748 --> 47:56.833
Mm.

47:58.251 --> 48:00.169
None whatsoever.

48:00.169 --> 48:02.672
I love our life together.

48:02.672 --> 48:06.968
Now, eat that disgusting slop
before it gets cold.

48:06.968 --> 48:08.428
And then we better
get to work.

48:10.346 --> 48:12.140
What's going to happen?

48:12.140 --> 48:15.059
Well, I only half
remember it, but...

48:15.059 --> 48:17.395
it always happens
the day we get married.

48:18.396 --> 48:19.439
Something major.

48:19.439 --> 48:22.817
Well, what do we do about it?

48:22.817 --> 48:26.279
I'm not sure,
but it's all going to be fine.

48:26.279 --> 48:28.323
We're gonna spend
our lives together,

48:28.323 --> 48:31.075
grow old together, I promise.

48:31.075 --> 48:32.827
You can't promise that, Barry.

48:35.246 --> 48:36.247
I can.

48:42.503 --> 48:45.298
You're probably wondering
how I got roped into this,
aren't you?

48:46.799 --> 48:49.636
Well, not a lot of people
know this,

48:49.636 --> 48:52.513
but my father pastored
the smallest church

48:52.513 --> 48:55.308
in M'Changa province, Zambessi.

48:55.308 --> 48:59.771
No church jet,
or church bus, or church walls,
for that matter.

48:59.771 --> 49:03.941
Just the most precious
resource of all. People.

49:05.026 --> 49:06.653
I never saw my father happier

49:06.653 --> 49:09.322
than when he was uniting people
together like this.

49:11.991 --> 49:18.498
And I've never seen two people
more united than Iris West
and Barry Allen.

49:32.762 --> 49:33.805
This is the thing.

49:33.805 --> 49:35.264
Yeah, I figured.

49:35.264 --> 49:37.642
Barry Allen of Earth-1.

49:37.642 --> 49:38.935
You are needed.

49:44.023 --> 49:46.484
Look, it's okay, everybody.
She's with me.

49:46.484 --> 49:48.861
- This is--
- I am Harbinger.

49:48.861 --> 49:50.905
Your world is in
terrible danger.

49:51.698 --> 49:52.824
Come with me.

49:54.409 --> 49:56.411
And I get that.

49:56.411 --> 49:59.997
But would waiting
an hour or two really make
that big a difference?

49:59.997 --> 50:05.128
I've been sent to gather
Earth's greatest champions.

50:05.128 --> 50:09.048
You're collecting
all the heroes.
Is that right?

50:09.048 --> 50:12.510
Well, we've got Green Arrow,
Vixen, Green Lantern
right here.

50:12.510 --> 50:15.346
We can save you,
like, five trips.

50:15.346 --> 50:16.431
What do you say?

50:50.965 --> 50:52.425
Flash.

50:58.306 --> 51:00.224
Working for the Nazis
didn't do you any favors.

51:01.350 --> 51:03.060
We have not met.

51:03.060 --> 51:06.355
I hail from an Earth
almost completely
covered by water,

51:06.355 --> 51:07.982
thanks to you
surface dwellers.

51:09.108 --> 51:10.193
Bruce!

51:12.528 --> 51:15.072
Look at you.
We're almost the same age.

51:16.949 --> 51:17.992
Do I know you?

51:21.621 --> 51:22.955
It's Dick.

51:22.955 --> 51:25.958
Dick Grayson. Robin?

51:25.958 --> 51:29.337
The Flying Graysons.
Tony Zucco.

51:30.171 --> 51:31.255
Yes.

51:31.255 --> 51:32.799
Uh, on my Earth,

51:32.799 --> 51:34.967
you took me in
after my parents' murder.

51:34.967 --> 51:37.637
Trained me.
I became your partner.

51:39.305 --> 51:40.556
I...

51:40.556 --> 51:42.934
That seems
terribly irresponsible.

51:44.268 --> 51:47.647
Maybe, but you, uh...

51:47.647 --> 51:50.650
He became my family.

51:50.650 --> 51:51.901
We helped a lot of people.

51:53.736 --> 51:55.154
I'm sorry.

51:55.154 --> 51:57.114
This must be so weird to you.

51:57.114 --> 51:58.783
And I apologize for this,

51:58.783 --> 52:00.701
but there's someone here
who really wants to meet you.

52:01.953 --> 52:04.121
Bruce, this is the Huntress.

52:04.956 --> 52:06.123
Helena Wayne.

52:07.375 --> 52:08.376
Dad?

52:11.003 --> 52:12.171
You look like her.

52:13.089 --> 52:15.424
Is Selina Kyle your...

52:15.424 --> 52:18.970
Yeah. Batman and Catwoman.

52:18.970 --> 52:21.013
A match made in Arkham.

52:21.013 --> 52:24.517
This must be weird for you,
but, well...

52:24.517 --> 52:26.352
Dad's been gone
for a few years now,

52:26.352 --> 52:29.397
and it's just nice
to see his face.

52:41.409 --> 52:42.410
Excuse me.

52:45.746 --> 52:47.415
Are you a sight for sore eyes.

52:58.134 --> 53:03.014
Kal, this is Clark Kent
from Earth-1.

53:03.014 --> 53:04.724
You have a lot in common.

53:05.975 --> 53:08.394
I guess we do.

53:08.394 --> 53:11.439
You're probably relieved to see
you'll keep most of your hair.

53:25.661 --> 53:27.496
Will Everett, Amazing Man.

53:27.496 --> 53:29.123
Blue Beetle, Ted Kord.

53:29.123 --> 53:31.709
This is Eve Eden, Nightshade.

53:31.709 --> 53:33.628
I question the wisdom

53:33.628 --> 53:36.172
of immediately revealing
your identity to someone
you just met.

53:37.506 --> 53:39.091
We're not even
from the same Earth.

53:40.051 --> 53:41.636
Or so they claim.

53:46.015 --> 53:49.268
Dr. Hoshi, I know this all
must seem very strange

53:49.268 --> 53:51.354
and disorienting to you, but--

53:51.354 --> 53:52.688
Strange?

53:52.688 --> 53:54.899
Yeah, you got that right.

53:54.899 --> 53:59.028
Everyone else here is dressed
and you have to kidnap me
in my bathrobe?

53:59.028 --> 54:03.032
This fabricator can provide you
with whatever clothing
you can imagine.

54:03.032 --> 54:07.370
I'm a photonics expert,
not a fashion designer.

54:07.370 --> 54:08.871
Don't worry.

54:08.871 --> 54:10.915
The machine anticipates
your needs

54:10.915 --> 54:12.833
- and designs appropriately.

54:35.523 --> 54:37.108
Are you kidding me?

54:37.108 --> 54:38.901
Am I supposed to
actually wear this?

54:38.901 --> 54:40.319
There is more.

54:45.074 --> 54:46.283
Holy crap.

54:46.283 --> 54:47.994
This is nuts.

54:47.994 --> 54:51.872
I can see the entire
light spectrum.

54:51.872 --> 54:53.791
What did you do to me?

54:53.791 --> 54:55.459
Change me back!

54:55.459 --> 54:58.462
As the Monitor ordered,
you now possess the powers

54:58.462 --> 55:00.923
that belong to the
criminal Doctor Light.

55:08.055 --> 55:10.641
Oh. It's not that bad.

55:40.254 --> 55:41.213
Dawnstar.

55:41.213 --> 55:43.632
Do you still not know me?

55:43.632 --> 55:45.634
I don't understand
what's happening.

55:45.634 --> 55:49.138
I came back in time
from the 31st century
on a mission.

55:49.138 --> 55:51.015
Then you just showed up.

55:52.183 --> 55:53.184
Do you not?

55:56.562 --> 55:59.774
Kara! Is that really you?

55:59.774 --> 56:00.941
It's really me.

56:04.862 --> 56:07.782
I don't understand.
What happened to you?

56:09.033 --> 56:10.618
It's a long story.

56:10.618 --> 56:13.120
I'll tell you the whole thing
as soon as we--

56:13.120 --> 56:14.288
Hear me.

56:15.539 --> 56:18.501
I am a Monitor.

56:18.501 --> 56:21.462
A member of a race
ancient beyond your reckoning.

56:23.380 --> 56:26.342
Since before your worlds began,

56:26.342 --> 56:30.679
my kind has lived
to observe and document,

56:30.679 --> 56:37.019
but never interfere,
with every event occurring
in the known universes.

56:37.019 --> 56:38.729
Whoa. Big job.

56:39.313 --> 56:40.815
Shh.

56:40.815 --> 56:45.528
I have broken sacred vows
due to a peril so dire,

56:45.528 --> 56:49.365
it threatens all realities
with utter annihilation.

56:51.033 --> 56:52.159
Behold...

56:58.624 --> 57:02.128
Most of you are aware
that you live in a reality

57:02.128 --> 57:07.299
that runs parallel
to many possible versions
of your universe.

57:07.299 --> 57:11.804
Some time ago,
my people became
conscious of this.

57:13.222 --> 57:15.099
Display the wave.

57:15.099 --> 57:16.392
Yes, Monitor.

57:19.145 --> 57:24.358
A massive
antimatter wave,
so vast and destructive,

57:24.358 --> 57:26.819
it decimates everything
in its path.

57:31.198 --> 57:35.953
Entire realities have been
erased from existence.

57:35.953 --> 57:40.040
I've gathered you all together
and hope that we can find

57:40.040 --> 57:42.668
some way to stop this disaster

57:43.711 --> 57:45.796
and save your worlds.

57:52.720 --> 57:54.597
Well, gotta change for work.

57:54.597 --> 57:56.891
I don't know why you bother.

57:56.891 --> 57:58.309
Just feels right.

57:58.309 --> 57:59.935
For old times' sake, I guess.

58:02.980 --> 58:06.859
That thing is as slow
as molasses in January.

58:06.859 --> 58:09.820
You'd be better off
keeping it on a hanger.

58:09.820 --> 58:11.822
Look, I'm already ready.

58:11.822 --> 58:14.575
Waiting on Barry,
just like the old days.

58:17.828 --> 58:20.748
I know why you still put
that raggedy old thing on.

58:22.791 --> 58:25.336
Because you still look
damn good in it.

58:47.024 --> 58:48.817
Don't you think
it's a bit absurd

58:48.817 --> 58:51.445
to use the emergency beacon
in the middle of this?

58:51.445 --> 58:54.073
Hell's breaking loose
all over this stupid planet.

58:54.073 --> 58:57.743
I... I stopped five tsunamis.

58:58.911 --> 59:01.372
Then I saw it.

59:18.055 --> 59:20.266
Damn, it gets worse.

59:20.266 --> 59:22.101
Yeah.

59:22.101 --> 59:25.020
I was kind of hoping
that magic hobo
was full of shit.

59:26.563 --> 59:28.857
This planet might suck,
but it's ours.

59:28.857 --> 59:31.527
So we do what we always do.

59:31.527 --> 59:32.736
Fight like hell.

59:35.239 --> 59:36.365
All right. What's the plan?

59:37.908 --> 59:39.702
My plan?

59:39.702 --> 59:44.039
My plan is I'm going to punch
that antimatter wall so hard,

59:44.039 --> 59:46.458
it's gonna shatter
into a million pieces.

59:57.553 --> 59:59.888
Wait! This can't be the plan.

01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:09.565
You're a strategist.

01:00:09.565 --> 01:00:10.858
Logical.

01:00:10.858 --> 01:00:14.278
This is a stupid
and useless gesture.

01:00:14.278 --> 01:00:18.073
Perhaps. The time comes
when the most logical
course of action

01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:19.950
is a stupid, useless gesture.

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:25.742
Entire realities
have been erased
from existence.

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:29.413
End display.

01:02:33.709 --> 01:02:36.545
I've gathered you all
and hope that together,

01:02:36.545 --> 01:02:40.757
we can find some way
to stop this disaster

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:43.093
and save your worlds.

01:02:46.472 --> 01:02:47.639
Excuse me, but--

01:02:50.726 --> 01:02:52.686
I have many questions.

01:02:54.563 --> 01:02:59.776
It would be strange indeed
if you did not.

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:01.695
I think that's
the Phantom Stranger.

01:03:01.695 --> 01:03:03.280
Few people ever see him.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.282
No, he's from my world.

01:03:05.282 --> 01:03:08.827
They call him the Question
because he never shuts up.

01:03:08.827 --> 01:03:10.829
Why should we believe
any of this?

01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:13.957
You kidnap us, show us a movie
and tell us we need to obey you

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:15.626
in order to save the world.

01:03:15.626 --> 01:03:18.587
All of this is
profoundly suspect.

01:03:19.505 --> 01:03:21.048
He makes a good point.

01:03:21.048 --> 01:03:22.549
When told to give up
our freedoms

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:24.635
because we face
an insurmountable threat,

01:03:24.635 --> 01:03:28.222
is there not also a threat
in relinquishing our freedoms?

01:03:28.222 --> 01:03:29.806
And why Earth?

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:32.476
The universe is massive
beyond comprehension.

01:03:32.476 --> 01:03:34.770
But most of us are from Earth.

01:03:35.896 --> 01:03:38.023
The reason is simple.

01:03:38.023 --> 01:03:42.611
The Earth is the first world
destroyed in every universe.

01:03:42.611 --> 01:03:46.406
Once it falls,
all else follows.

01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:49.326
Such an antimatter wave
is theoretically possible,
but--

01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:51.578
He's given us no proof at all.

01:03:51.578 --> 01:03:54.039
What's to stop us
from taking over this spaceship

01:03:54.039 --> 01:03:56.416
and figuring out
how to get ourselves home?

01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:00.504
It's true. It's all true.

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:01.838
Wonder Woman, hit me.

01:04:03.674 --> 01:04:05.592
For those of you
who don't know,

01:04:05.592 --> 01:04:09.096
the Lasso of Truth
compels complete honesty.

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.099
Look, I was on
one of the Earths

01:04:12.099 --> 01:04:13.642
that was swallowed
by this wave.

01:04:13.642 --> 01:04:14.768
It happened.

01:04:14.768 --> 01:04:16.144
The threat is real.

01:04:16.144 --> 01:04:17.312
Uh-oh.

01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:18.939
That does not look good.

01:04:39.001 --> 01:04:41.878
It's just like he said.
Coming at us like
an avalanche.

01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:45.507
It's coming for us, all right.
Pure antimatter.

01:04:45.507 --> 01:04:50.470
And speaking as a scientist,
we are completely
and totally screwed.

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:53.015
Then who are we to fight?

01:04:53.015 --> 01:04:54.891
You assemble
an army of warriors

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:57.102
and you give us
no one to attack.

01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:59.229
This isn't that kind of fight.

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:01.148
We can't punch our way
out of this.

01:05:02.024 --> 01:05:03.150
You got that right.

01:05:06.612 --> 01:05:07.613
Michael Holt,

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:09.656
Kimiyo Hoshi,

01:05:10.574 --> 01:05:12.367
Ted Kord.

01:05:12.367 --> 01:05:14.202
Genius-level scientists.

01:05:15.621 --> 01:05:16.872
Shayera Hol,

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:19.666
Diana of Themyscira,

01:05:20.876 --> 01:05:23.545
the Aquaman of Atlantis Earth.

01:05:23.545 --> 01:05:26.882
Each knowledgeable
about exo-terran technology.

01:05:26.882 --> 01:05:29.259
This is a think tank.

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:31.094
"Think tank"?

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:33.639
There's an antimatter avalanche
headed for our worlds,

01:05:33.639 --> 01:05:36.016
and this guy
wants to brainstorm?

01:05:36.016 --> 01:05:38.101
We need to take action.

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:41.229
You're quite right,
Amazing Man.

01:05:41.229 --> 01:05:43.899
That's why the rest of you
were brought here.

01:05:43.899 --> 01:05:49.154
You each possess the skills,
strength and speed

01:05:49.154 --> 01:05:53.950
to construct whatever defense
your best scientists devise.

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:56.953
What are you doing?

01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:58.789
We need geniuses.

01:05:58.789 --> 01:06:01.083
Your 31st-century boyfriend
would come in handy about now.

01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:11.677
Unfortunately,
the antimatter waves
somehow nullifies time travel.

01:06:11.677 --> 01:06:15.097
Communication may work,
but we can neither summon

01:06:15.097 --> 01:06:20.394
more allies here
nor escape into the past.

01:06:20.394 --> 01:06:22.938
And if we're not able to devise
some kind of solution?

01:06:22.938 --> 01:06:24.940
Then everything
in the Multiverse

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:28.944
will be completely
and utterly destroyed.

01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:02.853
Run!

01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:22.038
Ahhh!

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:24.291
Oh, damn it!

01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:25.751
Come on, we can make it.

01:07:25.751 --> 01:07:27.753
Make the jump with me.

01:07:27.753 --> 01:07:29.212
Not enough Speed Force.

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:30.922
And I'm in no shape.

01:07:32.883 --> 01:07:35.510
All that crap you said
about your world.

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:36.887
Was it true?

01:07:36.887 --> 01:07:38.096
Wh... What? Yeah.

01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:42.309
Lucky you.

01:07:45.479 --> 01:07:46.688
No!

01:07:57.741 --> 01:07:59.618
Wakey-wakey, eggs and bakey.

01:08:01.286 --> 01:08:03.789
After all this time, Barry,

01:08:03.789 --> 01:08:06.082
I fail to see the humor
in that joke.

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:09.753
Oh, have I done
that one before?

01:08:09.753 --> 01:08:12.798
-  Yes.
- Oh, well, breakfast time.

01:08:12.798 --> 01:08:14.049
Hope you get a charge
out of this.

01:08:14.049 --> 01:08:16.176
You've said that before too.

01:08:44.496 --> 01:08:46.248
Well, what have you got
for us today?

01:08:46.248 --> 01:08:48.959
I am excited to announce
that work on the final stage

01:08:48.959 --> 01:08:51.878
of the project
is 99% complete.

01:08:51.878 --> 01:08:55.590
I have prepared
detailed instructions
for both you and Iris.

01:08:58.051 --> 01:09:01.096
- Whoa. That's a lot of cable.
- I know.

01:09:01.096 --> 01:09:03.849
But it must be connected now.
Before--

01:09:03.849 --> 01:09:05.475
Before I'm too weak to do it.

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:06.810
I know, I know.

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:08.812
I'm old, not senile.

01:09:08.812 --> 01:09:10.355
At least, I don't think so.

01:09:12.023 --> 01:09:13.859
The lapses in memory
that have plagued you

01:09:13.859 --> 01:09:15.819
have been present
your entire life

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:20.448
and are not indicative
of a deteriorating
mental state.

01:09:20.448 --> 01:09:23.159
Hey, don't tell me.
Tell the old lady.

01:09:23.159 --> 01:09:26.204
Well, off to save the world.

01:09:26.204 --> 01:09:27.873
<i>The fact remains
that no shielding</i>

01:09:27.873 --> 01:09:29.749
<i>would be sufficient protection
from the phenomenon.</i>

01:09:33.503 --> 01:09:37.465
The shields we created
in Atlantis are designed
to withstand waves.

01:09:37.465 --> 01:09:39.217
Not antimatter waves.

01:09:39.217 --> 01:09:41.011
The theory is the same.

01:09:41.011 --> 01:09:42.721
But the power consumption.

01:09:42.721 --> 01:09:45.515
We'd require the energy
of a thousand exploding suns

01:09:45.515 --> 01:09:48.101
to put fields around
half our worlds!

01:09:48.101 --> 01:09:50.979
Let's keep our
tempers in check.

01:09:50.979 --> 01:09:54.733
This is
a brainstorming session,
not a debate.

01:09:54.733 --> 01:09:57.611
It's a goddamn crisis,
Princess.

01:09:57.611 --> 01:09:59.112
Hey.

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:03.325
I thought you guys could do
with some coffee.

01:10:03.325 --> 01:10:06.161
Ah. That's very
thoughtful of you.

01:10:06.161 --> 01:10:08.371
Well, gotta keep Team Brain
chugging along,

01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:10.040
so Team Brawn
can get to work, right?

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:17.255
Um...

01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:20.508
This is the best coffee
I've ever had in my life.

01:10:20.508 --> 01:10:22.427
He's right. It's amazing.

01:10:22.427 --> 01:10:24.346
And I didn't even like coffee.

01:10:24.346 --> 01:10:26.681
Well, I used water
from Aquaman's Earth,

01:10:26.681 --> 01:10:28.767
coffee beans from Jarhanpur
on Earth-X

01:10:28.767 --> 01:10:31.978
and cardamom from...
I forget what Earth that was.

01:10:31.978 --> 01:10:34.856
Harbinger took you
to all those worlds?

01:10:34.856 --> 01:10:37.442
No, I use super speed
to vibrate so quickly,

01:10:37.442 --> 01:10:39.027
I can pass through anything.

01:10:39.027 --> 01:10:40.612
Even through the planes
separating dimensions.

01:10:40.612 --> 01:10:42.614
Likewise, anything would
pass through you

01:10:42.614 --> 01:10:44.324
while vibrating at super speed.

01:10:44.324 --> 01:10:45.951
Yeah. It's my best trick.

01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:48.453
As a matter of fact,
when Earth-3 was wiped out,

01:10:48.453 --> 01:10:50.330
I soaked up
all its Speed Force.

01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:52.207
I'm supercharged.

01:10:52.207 --> 01:10:55.085
And it kind of knocked me out
of my linear time experience,
which sucks, but...

01:10:55.794 --> 01:10:58.088
What?

01:10:58.088 --> 01:11:02.717
A massive vibrational generator
on each of the Earths--

01:11:02.717 --> 01:11:05.345
Like a colossal
cosmic tuning fork.

01:11:05.345 --> 01:11:06.638
A tower.

01:11:06.638 --> 01:11:08.473
If we could power
just one of them,

01:11:08.473 --> 01:11:10.141
the vibrations
would reverberate

01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:11.559
through all of them.

01:11:11.559 --> 01:11:14.396
Even with a superpowered
construction team,

01:11:14.396 --> 01:11:17.440
the task of organizing
a project on this scale--

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:20.235
You forget, we have Batman.

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:25.281
So, I was right
about the coffee, huh?

01:13:10.762 --> 01:13:15.266
Hey, uh, Clark,
I've been meaning to ask you...

01:13:15.266 --> 01:13:18.561
When you saw Lois
at the party...

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:21.481
Yes. There was
a Lois on my world.

01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:24.943
She was a real firecracker.

01:13:24.943 --> 01:13:28.822
We were married for...
We had a good run.

01:13:29.823 --> 01:13:30.990
Old age.

01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:32.867
I was heartbroken
for a long time.

01:13:32.867 --> 01:13:33.910
And Diana?

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:35.578
Sometimes losing loved ones

01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:37.664
gives people
something in common.

01:13:37.664 --> 01:13:40.416
Someday,
she'll lose me too.

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:41.835
We're not immortal.

01:13:41.835 --> 01:13:45.880
She is. To lose everyone
again and again...

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.382
Great Scott.

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:57.267
No! It can't.

01:13:57.267 --> 01:13:58.685
We had time.

01:13:58.685 --> 01:14:00.311
We were going to finish.

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:02.522
<i>Are you seeing this?</i>

01:14:03.314 --> 01:14:04.858
It's impossible.

01:14:04.858 --> 01:14:08.945
A wave, any kind of wave,
cannot just... accelerate!

01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:12.448
I have borne witness
to the universe for millennia.

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:16.161
Nothing I have seen
would explain this.

01:14:16.161 --> 01:14:17.996
<i>There's only one explanation.</i>

01:14:17.996 --> 01:14:21.416
<i>The anomaly became aware
of our plans and adapted.</i>

01:14:21.416 --> 01:14:26.379
Impossible.
It's a natural phenomenon,
not a sentient foe.

01:14:26.379 --> 01:14:29.465
<i>I'm afraid we won't be around
long enough to find out.</i>

01:14:41.728 --> 01:14:43.021
Wait, this is it.

01:14:43.021 --> 01:14:44.772
There's nothing we can do.

01:14:44.772 --> 01:14:46.274
We just watch the world end?

01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:52.071
Run. Run to her.

01:14:58.995 --> 01:15:00.580


01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:06.878
This is Iris West
for GBS News.

01:15:06.878 --> 01:15:10.590
The antimatter wave
has somehow made a huge leap
closer to our world.

01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:14.510
Collision is imminent
and the final defense towers
remain unfinished.

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:19.098
If you are a believer, pray.
If you have loved ones,
hold them close.

01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:21.434


01:15:30.735 --> 01:15:33.321
Iris.

01:15:33.321 --> 01:15:35.740
I'm so sorry
I wasn't here for you.

01:15:37.492 --> 01:15:39.118
You were.

01:15:39.118 --> 01:15:43.539
You were late
for every dinner,
every movie.

01:15:43.539 --> 01:15:46.042
But you were always right
on time when I needed you.

01:16:00.431 --> 01:16:01.599
I love you, Barry.

01:16:07.814 --> 01:16:10.191
No, I won't let you go.

01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:28.918
Here. Here, let me get that.

01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:31.671
Don't you get all sexist on me.

01:16:31.671 --> 01:16:34.674
You do your list
and I'll do mine.

01:16:34.674 --> 01:16:36.384
Otherwise, we're never
gonna finish.

01:16:37.552 --> 01:16:38.678
Yes, boss.

01:16:49.897 --> 01:16:50.982
Barry...

01:16:54.986 --> 01:16:55.987
No.

01:16:57.739 --> 01:16:58.906
No. Iris.

01:16:58.906 --> 01:17:00.033
I'll get you home.

01:17:03.745 --> 01:17:05.038
I already am home...

01:17:07.373 --> 01:17:08.583
wherever you are.

01:17:12.462 --> 01:17:13.671
Iris, please.

01:17:15.256 --> 01:17:16.549
You can't leave me.

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:19.844
It's not for long.

01:17:20.928 --> 01:17:23.264
We're almost finished.

01:17:23.264 --> 01:17:26.768
Besides, we've had
the whole world
all to ourselves

01:17:26.768 --> 01:17:27.977
all these years.

01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:31.397
We can't be greedy.

01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:34.484
Iris.

01:17:36.194 --> 01:17:37.987
This is the big one, Barry.

01:17:40.365 --> 01:17:44.535
 Don't...
Don't be late.

01:18:16.776 --> 01:18:19.654
Contact Robin...
and Huntress.

01:18:22.281 --> 01:18:23.783
<i>Is it as bad as it looks?</i>

01:18:24.784 --> 01:18:29.247
Yes. I just want to say...

01:18:30.415 --> 01:18:34.293
Dad... Bruce, it's okay.

01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:51.853
I already miss Iris very much.

01:18:53.521 --> 01:18:55.690
Yes. Me too.

01:18:55.690 --> 01:18:57.024
But it's not for long.

01:18:58.234 --> 01:19:00.111
Yes, Barry.

01:19:00.111 --> 01:19:04.240
Even at this speed,
the wave moves
and it is nearly here.

01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:06.742
Will these things work?

01:19:08.494 --> 01:19:10.329
I do not know.

01:19:11.789 --> 01:19:13.541
Do you have enough power
to light 'em up?

01:19:13.541 --> 01:19:14.750
Almost.

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.252
After all these years...

01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:17.920
almost enough.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.590
You'll have to drop down
into normal time.

01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:23.050
The towers can't operate
at this speed.

01:19:24.302 --> 01:19:26.596
Okay. You ready?

01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:29.557
I don't wanna cut this
too close.

01:19:30.892 --> 01:19:32.477
Before we go...

01:19:32.477 --> 01:19:34.812
- Barry?
-  Yes, Amazo?

01:19:34.812 --> 01:19:40.526
Thank you for helping me
achieve my primary function.

01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:42.445
To prolong human life.

01:19:42.445 --> 01:19:45.781
Well, I guess you've done that
in a big way.

01:19:45.781 --> 01:19:46.866
If we don't blow up.

01:19:56.626 --> 01:19:58.503
-  Look!

01:19:58.503 --> 01:19:59.629
The tower.

01:20:01.339 --> 01:20:02.340
Barry.

01:20:03.007 --> 01:20:04.217
It's finished.

01:20:08.054 --> 01:20:09.096
Here goes nothing.

01:20:52.098 --> 01:20:53.975
Earth-2 tower is powering up.

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:02.900
Earth-X tower coming online.

01:21:21.252 --> 01:21:22.753
All towers are now functional.

01:21:29.802 --> 01:21:31.220
Will it be enough?

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:32.763
Unknown.

01:21:32.763 --> 01:21:35.891
We'll find out. In ten,

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:37.184
- nine...

01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:40.104
...eight, seven...

01:21:40.730 --> 01:21:41.731
six...

01:21:42.356 --> 01:21:45.192
five, four,

01:21:45.192 --> 01:21:47.528
three, two...

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:49.655
one.

01:21:49.655 --> 01:21:51.449
Contact with antimatter wave.

01:22:11.344 --> 01:22:13.888
Please... God...

01:23:03.479 --> 01:23:06.440
The experiment was
a success, Monitor.

01:23:08.401 --> 01:23:10.069
Astonishing.

01:23:10.069 --> 01:23:12.154
You didn't believe
it could be done.

01:23:14.865 --> 01:23:15.866
No.

01:23:17.535 --> 01:23:20.746
Neither do I believe in you.

01:23:20.746 --> 01:23:22.415
Yet you tried anyway.

01:23:23.165 --> 01:23:25.042
You hoped.

01:23:27.211 --> 01:23:31.465
- Perhaps I did.
-  Interesting.

01:23:31.465 --> 01:23:34.677
It is said you cannot have hope
without faith.

01:23:55.531 --> 01:23:56.657
We did it.

01:24:00.327 --> 01:24:02.121
You see that, Amazo?

01:24:02.121 --> 01:24:05.124
We did it. What do you think...

01:24:17.928 --> 01:24:19.263
He knew.

01:24:19.263 --> 01:24:22.391
In Amazo's last moment
of existence,

01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:25.352
he knew he had helped
save humanity.

01:24:25.352 --> 01:24:26.437
So...

01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:28.481
You're Death?

01:24:29.523 --> 01:24:31.066
I am the Spectre,

01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:32.985
the Wrath of God.

01:24:32.985 --> 01:24:36.489
Death is... better looking.

01:24:36.489 --> 01:24:39.992
But you are right in thinking
that the end is close.

01:24:39.992 --> 01:24:43.662
Wrath, huh?
Guess I'm in trouble.

01:24:43.662 --> 01:24:47.291
You bear some responsibility
for all that has happened here.

01:24:49.668 --> 01:24:52.755
Oh. How?

01:24:52.755 --> 01:24:54.757
It happened
before the beginning,

01:24:54.757 --> 01:24:56.717
but you have already
paid a heavy price

01:24:56.717 --> 01:24:59.637
for being unmoored in time.

01:24:59.637 --> 01:25:03.349
Well, I'm ready for whatever.

01:25:05.142 --> 01:25:06.644
I just wish
I could say goodbye.

01:25:09.021 --> 01:25:12.441
The Speed Force
still claims you its own.

01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:15.528
It will grant your farewells
before the end comes.

01:25:17.154 --> 01:25:18.197
What does that mean?

01:25:45.432 --> 01:25:47.476
The Flash...

01:25:47.476 --> 01:25:49.311
- The Flash...

01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:51.188
It's the beginning.

01:25:51.188 --> 01:25:53.482
He said
"before the beginning."

01:25:54.859 --> 01:25:56.819
Huh? Who's there?

01:26:16.630 --> 01:26:19.341
It's... It's you, isn't it?

01:26:20.134 --> 01:26:21.760
Go back.

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:23.637
You must go back.

01:26:23.637 --> 01:26:24.847
You must stop it.

01:26:27.266 --> 01:26:28.309
Go back...

01:26:29.268 --> 01:26:30.436
to before the beginning.

01:26:45.117 --> 01:26:47.786
We can save you,
like, five trips.

01:26:47.786 --> 01:26:48.954
What do you say?

01:26:50.581 --> 01:26:52.541
Yeah, too bad Batman
and Superman are AWOL,

01:26:52.541 --> 01:26:54.752
or we'd give you them too.

01:26:54.752 --> 01:26:57.087
I have already
teleported Batman,

01:26:57.087 --> 01:27:00.716
Superman and Wonder Woman
to the Monitor's satellite.

01:27:00.716 --> 01:27:01.967
They await us there.

01:27:03.969 --> 01:27:06.096
Listen... Harbinger?

01:27:06.096 --> 01:27:07.806
I got a proposition for you.

01:28:37.062 --> 01:28:40.024
Dawnstar? Are you okay?

01:28:40.024 --> 01:28:44.361
I... I feel weird.

01:28:44.361 --> 01:28:45.821
-  Monitor!

01:28:51.785 --> 01:28:54.163
Brainy! Brainiac 5, come in!

01:28:54.163 --> 01:28:56.040
There's something wrong
with Dawnstar.

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.416
She's vanishing.

01:28:57.416 --> 01:28:58.500
You've got to help her!

01:29:00.127 --> 01:29:01.211
<i>Kara...</i>

01:29:05.382 --> 01:29:07.509
Brainy. No!

01:29:08.927 --> 01:29:12.139
<i>It's not just her... or me.</i>

01:29:12.139 --> 01:29:14.141
<i>The whole world, Kara.</i>

01:29:14.141 --> 01:29:16.935
<i>The universe, maybe.
It's all vanishing.</i>

01:29:18.062 --> 01:29:19.063
What's happening?

01:29:19.688 --> 01:29:20.939
How do I stop it?

01:29:24.818 --> 01:29:27.029
<i>I... I think whatever
happened back there</i>

01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:32.618
<i>changed history, my world.
Everything I know
never happened.</i>

01:29:32.618 --> 01:29:34.703
<i>A chrono-anomaly, I...</i>

01:29:34.703 --> 01:29:36.121
<i>I... I never really existed.</i>

01:29:36.872 --> 01:29:40.501
Brainy. No!

01:29:40.501 --> 01:29:42.961
<i>But if you somehow
remember me,</i>

01:29:42.961 --> 01:29:44.963
<i>know this...</i>

01:29:44.963 --> 01:29:46.715
<i>I loved you, Kara...</i>

01:29:46.715 --> 01:29:48.342
No!
