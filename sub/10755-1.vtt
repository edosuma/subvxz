WEBVTT

00:09.810 --> 00:12.410
Come on in!
Come on, it's all over!

00:13.180 --> 00:17.780
He won't mess with you!
Are you nuts? That was a Doberman!

00:19.100 --> 00:20.254
Oh dear, what happened?

00:20.289 --> 00:23.180
Oh, get the first aid kit.
Eddie got into a fight.

00:23.320 --> 00:26.250
We were on the elevator
with that Doberman from upstairs.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.700
Eddie took a perfectly
innocent sniff, and wham!

00:30.190 --> 00:31.490
Morning, all.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.990
-What's all this?
-Eddie was viciously attacked.

00:35.610 --> 00:37.990
Is that coffee cake I smell?

00:40.620 --> 00:43.494
Well, now that I look at it,
it's just a scratch.

00:43.529 --> 00:45.790
But I probably should take
him to the vet's anyway.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.500
What are you doing up so early?

00:47.810 --> 00:50.326
Oh, the new station manager's
taking over today.

00:50.361 --> 00:53.010
-She wanted to meet with all of us.
-"She?"

00:53.300 --> 00:56.300
-Oh, working for a woman, huh?
-Yes, why?

00:56.800 --> 00:59.793
Well, it's tough on guys,
taking orders from a woman.

00:59.828 --> 01:01.520
-We resent it!
-That's absurd.

01:01.730 --> 01:03.800
If I had trouble taking
orders from a woman...

01:03.835 --> 01:05.830
...Frederick would never
have been conceived!

01:08.520 --> 01:11.250
My brothers couldn't stand
taking orders from me.

01:11.285 --> 01:11.820
I was forever telling them...

01:12.000 --> 01:13.667
"Billy, clean your room."

01:13.702 --> 01:15.200
"Reginald, get your elbow
out of the gravy."

01:15.350 --> 01:17.716
"Nigel, take that thing
back to the hospital...

01:17.751 --> 01:20.700
...the whole house is full of flies!"

01:22.200 --> 01:25.330
-Morning, Niles.
-Hello, Frasier. Dad, Daphne.

01:25.530 --> 01:27.655
Uh, I can't stay,
I just wanted to ask a favor.

01:27.690 --> 01:30.290
Dad, can I borrow your gun?

01:30.800 --> 01:34.800
-Maris taking singing lessons again?
-No.

01:35.010 --> 01:37.352
Our home security system
is down for repairs...

01:37.387 --> 01:40.810
...and with no electric gates I'll
just feel safer if I'm packing heat.

01:41.130 --> 01:42.401
Oh, for heaven's sake, Niles.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.930
You don't even know how
to pack a lunch.

01:45.820 --> 01:48.457
Dad, please. Maris is a wreck
ever since she found out...

01:48.492 --> 01:51.038
...our entire neighborhood watch
is wintering in Palm Beach.

01:51.073 --> 01:53.700
Forget it, you don't know
the first thing about guns.

01:53.880 --> 01:56.880
I do so. I promise I'll open the spinny
thing and check for bullets...

01:56.980 --> 01:58.980
...before I shoot anybody.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.938
Actually, Dr. Crane, your father's
gun isn't a revolver.

02:01.973 --> 02:04.430
It's a Colt .45 ACP with
a single stack magazine.

02:07.710 --> 02:11.930
When I first came to America,
I worked at a convenience store.

02:13.820 --> 02:14.747
Dad, please.

02:14.782 --> 02:16.510
No! I don't believe in
civilians having guns.

02:16.700 --> 02:19.000
This isn't fair!
Maris's mother gave her a gun!

02:19.120 --> 02:21.014
Well, then Maris's mother
can clean the mess up...

02:21.049 --> 02:23.820
...after she accidentally
blows your brains out.

02:24.060 --> 02:25.728
Dad, now you're
talking nonsense.

02:25.763 --> 02:28.660
Maris's mother has never
cleaned anything in her life.

02:35.440 --> 02:37.623
This stinks. This is total BS.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.610
I can't work for a chick.
They're out of control.

02:39.910 --> 02:44.240
They are completely ruled by
their hormones. It'll never work.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.271
All right, all right,
listen up everyone.

02:48.298 --> 02:49.662
I've been working
the office grapevine.

02:49.697 --> 02:50.620
I've got the scoop on the new boss.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.210
-Is she going to fire me?
-Hey, first things first!

02:53.540 --> 02:55.840
Is she baggable?

02:56.130 --> 02:58.470
Forget it, Bulldog,
she'd have you for breakfast.

02:58.510 --> 03:01.930
Right, like I ever
stick around that long.

03:02.180 --> 03:05.930
Anyway, the word is that she's
like this psycho perfectionist.

03:06.430 --> 03:08.636
Everyone at her last station
was scared to death of her.

03:08.671 --> 03:10.140
She's kind of becoming my idol.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.000
Hey, what if she hates sports?
I need this job.

03:13.300 --> 03:16.000
I just promised my mom
a new pacemaker.

03:16.320 --> 03:19.530
Wait, think I could get her
to believe I said "pasta maker?"

03:21.950 --> 03:24.450
Now, look, there's no reason
for us to give in to our insecurities.

03:24.740 --> 03:26.490
We all do good, solid shows.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.917
We hardly even know this woman...

03:27.952 --> 03:31.580
...and already we're painting
her as a heartless Medusa!

03:34.840 --> 03:39.550
She said my ratings are down.
She said I'm not "hip."

03:40.550 --> 03:46.140
-Father Mike, are you all right?
-The little thug fired me!

03:47.430 --> 03:50.390
-I'm so sorry.
-Did she say anything else?

03:50.550 --> 03:54.150
She said, "Send in Frasier."

03:57.640 --> 04:00.201
Listen, tell the movers
I want the couch...

04:00.236 --> 04:02.640
...directly in front of the bookcase.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.260
Oh, have a seat.

04:10.960 --> 04:14.260
No, not there!
In front of the bookcase!

04:17.240 --> 04:20.740
Look, I got somebody here!

04:21.690 --> 04:24.790
Could we move the furniture later?
Could we do that?

04:27.040 --> 04:31.640
-Dr. Frasier Crane! Kate Costas.
-Kate, what a pleasure.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.730
Likewise. I've been listening to
the tapes of all your shows.

04:35.040 --> 04:40.440
-I love what you're doing.
-Really? Well, thank you very much!

04:40.940 --> 04:42.245
I like to think of my show
as a haven...

04:42.280 --> 04:45.950
...for the tempest-tossed in
the maelstrom of everyday life.

04:46.230 --> 04:49.330
Wow. You really talk that way.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.700
Anyway, your ratings
are very good.

04:52.810 --> 04:57.310
But I still think we can
do better. Any ideas?

04:57.830 --> 05:01.630
How to improve my show?

05:03.500 --> 05:06.000
That is a tall order.

05:06.990 --> 05:09.842
Oh, wait, you know, I was
thinking of playing classical music...

05:09.877 --> 05:11.690
...before my intros.
Let's say, perhaps...

05:11.890 --> 05:14.390
Bartok's Concerto
for Orchestra in D Minor.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.222
It's too highbrow. I mean,
I love classical music...

05:17.257 --> 05:19.160
...but to most people
it's a big snore.

05:19.360 --> 05:23.031
Oh, incidentally,
Bartok's Concerto is in C.

05:23.066 --> 05:25.360
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

05:25.520 --> 05:28.020
I put myself through college
working at a classical station.

05:28.170 --> 05:31.470
Let's talk about advertising.
You've got a great face.

05:31.670 --> 05:35.020
I want to see it on t-shirts,
I want to see it on park benches...

05:35.055 --> 05:35.870
...I even want to see it on Frisbees.

05:36.170 --> 05:40.340
Everybody in Seattle should be
tossing it, wearing it, sitting on it!

05:44.220 --> 05:46.020
Wonderful.

05:46.250 --> 05:50.150
You know, I hate to nitpick,
but I'm certain that concerto's in D.

05:50.360 --> 05:53.360
-I was a music minor at Harvard.
-It's in C.

05:53.550 --> 05:56.658
It was commissioned by
Serge Kosivinsky in 1943...

05:56.693 --> 05:57.800
...for the Boston Symphony Orchestra...

05:57.970 --> 06:01.970
...and since then it's been recorded
over thirty timesâ€”each time, in C.

06:04.860 --> 06:08.360
Well maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm right.

06:09.370 --> 06:12.670
Also, I think you should
start doing theme shows.

06:12.870 --> 06:15.370
Devote a whole show to people
having extramarital affairs...

06:15.560 --> 06:19.760
...or devote a whole show to people
with aberrant sexual practices.

06:20.060 --> 06:23.260
-Could you give me a hand with
that box over there?  -Of course.

06:25.970 --> 06:27.970
Kate...

06:28.750 --> 06:33.180
...you know, that advertising thing.
It's a very good idea. But that...

06:34.260 --> 06:38.314
These theme shows, uh,
it's a less good idea.

06:38.349 --> 06:40.260
You might even say a worse idea.

06:40.520 --> 06:42.870
-Why is that?
-Well...

06:43.100 --> 06:47.900
I am a doctor, and I'd hate to
have the serious work I do...

06:48.120 --> 06:52.020
-...be tainted by commercialism.
-But you don't mind the Frisbees.

06:52.830 --> 06:56.540
Well, I don't want to be
entirely uncooperative.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.141
It's just that, well, you know,
I've been in the radio game...

06:59.207 --> 07:01.850
...for some time now, and I think
I've learned enough about...

07:02.380 --> 07:05.980
...broadcasting, as they say,
to know what it is...

07:06.990 --> 07:10.234
...that makes my show
a good show.

07:10.269 --> 07:11.990
My God, you've won
six Golden Mike awards?

07:12.220 --> 07:14.920
Aren't you sweet to notice.

07:16.180 --> 07:20.380
Finally, I would like you to start
giving priority to the juicier calls.

07:20.690 --> 07:26.090
-That's called pandering!
-And that is called a Peabody Award!

07:28.360 --> 07:30.740
Well, what exactly do you
expect me to do? Say to a caller...

07:30.950 --> 07:32.717
"Listen, Bob, I'm sorry
you lost your job...

07:32.752 --> 07:33.410
...but unemployment's a snore!

07:33.450 --> 07:35.214
Why don't you go sleep
with your best friend's wife...

07:35.249 --> 07:36.589
...and call in on Monday
when it'll be...

07:36.624 --> 07:39.080
...Infidelity Day on
the Frasier Crane Show!"

07:40.460 --> 07:42.410
I really know what I'm doing here.

07:42.520 --> 07:45.170
The psychiatrists at my
last station went national.

07:45.250 --> 07:47.940
Well, you know, I'd rather stay
local if going national means...

07:48.180 --> 07:51.080
...sucking at the sump-pump
of sensationalism!

07:51.440 --> 07:55.890
Well, I'm the boss,
Doc. So, pucker up!

07:56.280 --> 07:58.580
Listen, lady,
I'm not changing my show.

07:58.730 --> 08:00.630
Unless you're willing
to explain to the owners...

08:00.790 --> 08:02.861
...why you fired one of
your highest-rated hosts...

08:02.896 --> 08:05.290
...well then there's nothing
you can do about it, is there?

08:06.650 --> 08:09.780
Well, we're coming up on 3 A.M.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.560
Roz, who's our next caller?

08:16.700 --> 08:19.000
Who cares?

08:26.390 --> 08:28.690
<i>I got to disagree with
your last two callers.</i>

08:28.890 --> 08:30.615
<i>I'm in the same line
of work, and I think...</i>

08:30.650 --> 08:33.690
<i>...that what we do is very important!
People depend on us!</i>

08:33.850 --> 08:37.450
<i>I got to go, Doc, it's time
to powder the jelly donuts.</i>

08:44.390 --> 08:48.390
Well, I hate to cut short
this enthralling symposium...

08:48.780 --> 08:53.580
...but perhaps we could hear
from some non-bakers for a change?

08:54.370 --> 08:56.808
Wrap it up, will you?
We're finally done.

08:56.843 --> 08:58.270
Oh, thank God.

08:58.410 --> 08:59.666
Stay tuned for the news,
weather, and sports.

08:59.701 --> 09:02.790
This is Dr. Frasier Crane,
yadda-yadda-yadda, bye.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.615
-Really stunk up the airwaves
with that one, didn't we?

09:07.650 --> 09:11.170
Frasier, I want you to
flash forward to tonight.

09:11.420 --> 09:14.820
It's sometime after midnight.
Dennis Abbott and I have just had...

09:14.940 --> 09:18.782
...a glorious meal at Le Ralee.
Dennis has just asked me...

09:18.817 --> 09:19.740
...back to his penthouse apartment...

09:19.860 --> 09:22.844
...to see his priceless collection
of silk sheets.

09:22.879 --> 09:24.860
And I lean forward and whisper...

09:25.130 --> 09:29.080
"I can't. I have to go to
work in an hour."

09:29.380 --> 09:34.980
-What is wrong with this picture?!
-Well, for starters, you at Le Ralee.

09:35.860 --> 09:39.760
-It's a two-week wait.
-So is Dennis Abbott!

09:40.600 --> 09:43.000
Frasier, we have got to get
our old time slot back!

09:43.200 --> 09:46.200
Don't worry, Roz, we will she
just moved us to break our spirit.

09:46.400 --> 09:49.639
Well, she can saddle me up and
ride me around the coffee room!

09:49.674 --> 09:51.900
I can't do this again!

09:52.170 --> 09:54.720
-Good morning.
-Oh, hello.

09:55.090 --> 09:56.739
Enjoying your new time slot?

09:56.774 --> 10:00.680
As a matter of fact, I found it
invigorating! Didn't you, Roz?

10:00.720 --> 10:02.825
Remember that woman who
called in, uh, you know...

10:02.860 --> 10:04.920
...with the delusions of grandeur?

10:05.180 --> 10:09.480
Couldn't understand
why nobody liked her.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.779
Well, I hope you explained to her...

10:12.814 --> 10:14.710
...that it's not important
that people like her...

10:14.910 --> 10:18.510
-...as long as they respect her.
-Oh yes, respect is important.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.820
-So is self-respect.
-Oh, yes, yes...

10:21.070 --> 10:23.531
...but some people â€”
and this is so unfortunate...

10:23.566 --> 10:25.970
...can't tell the difference between
self-respect and pig-headedness.

10:26.120 --> 10:29.583
Yes, but those people are
usually rigid little demagogues...

10:29.618 --> 10:30.520
...who don't know the difference...

10:30.740 --> 10:32.167
...between the kind of
respect that is earned...

10:32.202 --> 10:33.740
...and the kind of respect that is...

10:33.940 --> 10:38.340
...irrespective ...of
what others expect.

10:40.390 --> 10:44.090
Isn't it sad when bad things
happen to good sentences?

10:45.350 --> 10:47.250
I think I made myself clear.

10:47.450 --> 10:49.710
Well, I really do have work to do.

10:49.745 --> 10:51.750
I've got to find somebody
for your old time slot...

10:51.970 --> 10:55.370
-...now that it's free.
-Good luck!

10:56.650 --> 10:59.701
Nice going, Frasier, now
she's never gonna give in.

10:59.736 --> 11:00.750
Steady, Roz.
She may have been able...

11:00.910 --> 11:02.478
...to intimidate people
in other stations...

11:02.513 --> 11:06.310
...but here at KACL she'll find that we
are not a bunch of spineless twits!

11:07.090 --> 11:10.490
Hey! Is she gone?

11:16.060 --> 11:17.773
You don't want this bacon,
I'm giving it to Eddie.

11:17.808 --> 11:19.760
You know that bacon's
not good for him.

11:19.900 --> 11:22.300
Eddie! Hey, Eddie! Come here, boy!

11:28.730 --> 11:31.330
-And can't we take that
stupid thing off him? -No!

11:31.540 --> 11:34.540
No! The vet said if he scratches
the scabs, they'll never heal.

11:34.670 --> 11:37.344
And I have noticed that if
you sit him next to the telly...

11:37.379 --> 11:39.470
...Channel Five comes in a lot clearer.

11:42.280 --> 11:44.780
Look at him,
he's humiliated!

11:45.840 --> 11:50.090
Yeah, well, it doesn't help that that
bully upstairs keeps rubbing it in.

11:50.330 --> 11:52.630
You tell him, boy!

11:53.670 --> 11:56.670
Oh, for God's sake,
I am trying to get some sleep!

11:56.930 --> 11:58.871
I asked you to keep
that dog quiet...

11:58.906 --> 12:01.530
...and instead you outfit
him with a megaphone!

12:09.230 --> 12:12.430
In the last thirty-six hours I
haven't had so much as a nap...

12:12.465 --> 12:14.880
...and I've got to be back
at the station by 2 A.M.

12:15.110 --> 12:17.810
Eddie, listen carefully.

12:19.050 --> 12:23.550
By the time this day is up,
one of us is going to sleep.

12:25.240 --> 12:28.290
Oh, don't worry, Dr. Crane,
I'll take Eddie for a walk.

12:28.430 --> 12:30.649
And as far as your
problem at work goes...

12:30.684 --> 12:32.730
-If you want my opinionâ€”
-Don't!

12:33.830 --> 12:36.380
I've had my share of women's
opinions for the week...

12:36.510 --> 12:38.373
...between the station's
new Reichschancellor...

12:38.408 --> 12:40.910
...and Roz's incessant whining!

12:41.080 --> 12:45.080
As far as I'm concerned, your
entire sex can put a sock in it!

12:46.600 --> 12:50.100
Boy, you'd never let me get
away with a comment like that.

12:50.220 --> 12:54.020
Oh, even the best of us can get
a bit cranky when we're overtired.

12:54.240 --> 12:58.640
All Dr. Crane needs right now
is a little peace and quiet.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.420
Eddie?

13:02.150 --> 13:04.740
Damn it!

13:08.530 --> 13:10.789
Morning, Daphne.
Where are you off to?

13:10.824 --> 13:13.130
-Oh, I'm taking Eddie for a walk.
-By yourself?

13:13.260 --> 13:15.460
Yes, of course. Why not?

13:15.590 --> 13:19.390
It's dangerous out there.
You never know when you might need...

13:20.610 --> 13:22.610
...one of these.

13:23.760 --> 13:26.160
A starter's pistol?

13:27.560 --> 13:31.560
Oh, I don't think so, Dr. Crane.
But thanks for the thought.

13:34.990 --> 13:37.190
How did she know it
wasn't a real gun?

13:37.350 --> 13:38.314
It fooled the servants...

13:38.349 --> 13:41.650
...even the ones who spent
years fleeing juntas.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.538
You bought a starter's pistol?

13:44.573 --> 13:46.720
Yes, you see, as long as
Maris thinks it's real...

13:46.880 --> 13:49.980
...it makes her feel secure,
but this way no one can get hurt.

13:55.630 --> 13:58.430
What the hell was that?!

13:58.580 --> 14:01.580
-Was that a gunshot?!
-Morning, Frasier. Just getting up?

14:01.750 --> 14:04.250
"Just getting up?!"

14:05.110 --> 14:07.910
Are you out of your mind?!
A gun just went off in here!

14:08.080 --> 14:10.356
Niles bought a starter's pistol.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.980
And there's no need to get snippy.
Accidents happen, you know.

14:13.230 --> 14:15.630
Oh, I'm sorry, was I snippy?

14:17.140 --> 14:18.678
I didn't realize it was
too much to ask...

14:18.713 --> 14:22.440
...that there not be
gunplay in my living room!

14:24.950 --> 14:27.750
You know, Niles, you shouldn't
have any kind of gun, really.

14:27.940 --> 14:30.914
Come to think of it, now that
Mr. Sunshine's home during the day...

14:30.949 --> 14:32.840
...maybe I shouldn't either!

14:34.360 --> 14:35.760
Just relax.

14:35.970 --> 14:38.570
It won't be long before
my loyal fans protest...

14:38.750 --> 14:41.950
...and the afternoon slot
is once again home...

14:42.170 --> 14:45.370
...to the compassionate
and lovable Dr. Frasier Crane.

14:45.570 --> 14:48.370
Now get the hell out,
both of you!

14:49.160 --> 14:52.370
All right, maybe I can catch
up to Daphne in the park.

14:52.405 --> 14:53.760
I'll cover you.

14:59.230 --> 15:02.230
Hello, Seattle, this
is Dr. Frasier Crane.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.541
I'll be taking your calls
for the next four hours.

15:04.576 --> 15:05.400
Roz, who's on the line?

15:05.550 --> 15:08.550
How should I know?
I just got here.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.840
Line Two, you're on
with Dr. Frasier Crane.

15:13.970 --> 15:19.370
<i>-Uh, hey, Dr. Crane. It's Mark.</i>
-Hello, Mark. I'm listening.  <i>-OK.</i>

15:21.250 --> 15:23.930
<i>Uh, well, I work at this
all-night mini-mart, and, um...</i>

15:23.965 --> 15:26.450
<i>I've been watching myself
on the video camera...</i>

15:26.650 --> 15:30.650
<i>...and the camera-me is
doing things I don't approve of.</i>

15:40.440 --> 15:45.140
People think insomnia is a
laughing matter, but it's hell.

15:45.270 --> 15:48.970
If I don't get some sleep soon,
I'll justâ€”I'll go crazy!

15:49.260 --> 15:54.260
You've got to help me,
Dr. Crane? Dr. Crane?

15:56.750 --> 15:59.350
<i>Hey, I'm talking here!</i>

16:00.150 --> 16:03.150
What?! I'm listening.

16:06.880 --> 16:09.580
<i>So what do you think
I should do?</i>

16:12.340 --> 16:17.140
Well, you know, sometimes these things
seem clearer in the light of day.

16:17.360 --> 16:20.360
My advice is to sleep on it.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.496
<i>Is that some kind of a joke?!</i>

16:24.531 --> 16:27.700
<i>-To make fun of the insomniac?!</i>
-Oh, noâ€”

16:33.200 --> 16:37.600
Oh, oh, and now
for a word from...

16:39.250 --> 16:42.750
I forget,
I think they sell paint.

16:47.150 --> 16:51.750
You hear that whooshing sound?
It's my career going down the toilet.

16:52.150 --> 16:55.250
-Oh God, Roz, I don't think I've helped
a single person tonight.  -Helped?

16:55.440 --> 16:58.740
You'll be lucky if you don't get sued!
You told a longshoreman...

16:58.920 --> 17:00.197
...to come out of the closet...

17:00.232 --> 17:04.020
...and a gay guy to spend
more time on the docks!

17:04.310 --> 17:07.000
-Well, you're the one who's supposed to
keep track of who's on what line!

17:07.035 --> 17:07.810
OK, let me make it easy for you:

17:08.020 --> 17:11.720
Freaks! Freaks on Line One!
Freaks on Line Two! Freaks, everywhere!

17:11.859 --> 17:15.859
Roz, Roz, Roz! We shouldn't
get mad at each other.

17:16.720 --> 17:19.845
-Oh God, this is all Kate's fault.
-You're right, you're right.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.020
She's ruining us!
And there's nothing we can do.

17:22.260 --> 17:23.443
Yes, there is!

17:23.478 --> 17:26.269
If we're gonna go down, we're
gonna take her down with us!

17:26.304 --> 17:27.160
We've got one hour left.

17:27.290 --> 17:29.315
If she wants raunch, we're
gonna give her more raunch...

17:29.350 --> 17:31.090
...than she ever dreamed of!
Are you with me, Roz?

17:31.230 --> 17:34.730
-Just pump up the volume
and call me Kitty!  -OK!

17:36.180 --> 17:40.180
We're back, Seattle. And in
accordance with new station policy...

17:40.340 --> 17:43.686
...we are going to be pandering
to the lowest human instinct.

17:43.721 --> 17:44.140
In other words...

17:44.320 --> 17:48.520
...who wants to talk about sex?!
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex!

17:50.600 --> 17:52.300
Yeah!

17:53.770 --> 17:55.838
I want to know who's having sex!

17:55.873 --> 17:59.770
How you're having it! I want to know
if you're having it right now!

18:00.490 --> 18:04.890
Look, Dr. Crane,
the lines are hot! Really hot!

18:05.490 --> 18:07.190
Thank you, Kitty.

18:07.390 --> 18:11.690
-Hello, Caller. What are you wearing?
<i>-Nothing. I'm naked...</i>

18:11.870 --> 18:14.370
Hey, that's a great idea!

18:14.570 --> 18:18.070
Let's all get naked! Hey,
I'm getting naked right now!

18:19.370 --> 18:22.770
While Dr. Crane strips, our new
station manager would like to know...

18:22.900 --> 18:26.200
...if you prefer to be
the spanker, or the spankee.

18:26.380 --> 18:28.091
<i>Oh, definitely the spanker.</i>

18:28.126 --> 18:32.180
Well then, hop in a cab!
I'm not wearing any pants!

18:36.360 --> 18:40.560
<i>While Roz laces up her leather
bustier, this is Dr. Frasier Crane...</i>

18:40.780 --> 18:46.580
<i>KACL - all talk,
all night, all naked!</i>

18:49.380 --> 18:53.590
-Explain.
-As George Bernard Shaw once said...

18:53.760 --> 18:55.460
..."there are two
tragedies in life.

18:55.680 --> 18:59.680
One is not getting what we want,
and the other is getting it."

18:59.840 --> 19:02.690
You know full well this
is not what I wanted!

19:02.725 --> 19:04.740
You did this to vex me.

19:05.890 --> 19:07.790
And you succeeded.

19:08.030 --> 19:10.399
And it was not Shaw,
it was Oscar Wilde.

19:10.434 --> 19:12.630
Did you ever open a book
at Harvard?

19:12.870 --> 19:16.634
You know, one of these days,
you're going to misquote someone...

19:16.669 --> 19:19.170
...and I'm going to land on
you like a sumo wrestler!

19:21.600 --> 19:25.267
All I wanted, all I wanted was
a lousy little theme show.

19:25.302 --> 19:26.200
Once or twice a week!

19:26.400 --> 19:30.400
Oh, yeah! "Frasier Crane takes
a leering look at infidelity!"

19:30.530 --> 19:32.894
No, not a leering look!
Just a good look.

19:32.929 --> 19:35.430
At the pain of infidelity,
at what it does to families...

19:35.710 --> 19:38.929
...at what it does to children, at what
it does to the fabric of society...

19:38.964 --> 19:40.510
...and this is just off
the top of my head.

19:40.550 --> 19:43.550
But, no! You are such
an arrogant gasbag...

19:43.690 --> 19:46.046
...so used to being
cock-of-the-walk around here...

19:46.081 --> 19:47.690
...that you can't stand
still for one minute...

19:47.840 --> 19:50.089
...and listen to a perfectly
valid suggestion...

19:50.124 --> 19:51.440
-...from somebody else!
-And you...

19:51.700 --> 19:54.974
...are such a smug egomaniac
that your entire self-image...

19:55.009 --> 19:55.800
...would shatter like a cheap mirror...

19:55.990 --> 19:58.990
...if you ever had to admit
that you had made a mistake!

19:59.220 --> 20:01.775
You are a classic case
of neurotic narcissism...

20:01.810 --> 20:04.520
...and a first-class smarty-pants!

20:06.990 --> 20:12.790
-You can go ahead and fire me now.
-Yes, I could do that, yeah.

20:13.110 --> 20:15.810
But I'm not going to.

20:16.960 --> 20:19.760
Did you listen
to the whole tape?

20:20.100 --> 20:21.700
Oh, yeah.

20:21.840 --> 20:24.938
But, unlike you, I put
what's good for the station...

20:24.973 --> 20:26.840
...above my personal feelings.

20:27.220 --> 20:30.720
Well, that's-that's
awfully big of you.

20:31.170 --> 20:33.846
Guess that means I'll be moving
back to my old time slot.

20:33.881 --> 20:36.670
Guess again, Captain Midnight!

20:37.360 --> 20:39.469
If I give you back
your old time slot...

20:39.504 --> 20:41.260
...without your making
a single concession to me...

20:41.400 --> 20:43.900
...that would completely
undermine my authority.

20:44.100 --> 20:47.300
Being a crack shrink,
surely that's within your grasp.

20:47.510 --> 20:51.210
Grasp this: if I don't get
my old time slot, I quit!

20:51.380 --> 20:55.530
Grasp this: you do, and I'll
sue you for breach of contract!

20:55.750 --> 20:57.850
OK, then it's a stalemate!

20:58.030 --> 21:00.650
If we don't want to remain entrenched
in these positions forever...

21:00.685 --> 21:02.330
...one of us had better
think of something!

21:02.490 --> 21:04.890
Yes, one of us better.

21:17.750 --> 21:20.050
-I've got it!
-Damn!

21:23.810 --> 21:26.210
-So, we're together, right?
-Absolutely.

21:26.450 --> 21:28.596
We're not letting her push
us around any longer!

21:28.631 --> 21:29.750
Nope. You do the talking.

21:29.930 --> 21:32.930
I'll stand behind you and burn
holes through her with my...

21:33.140 --> 21:36.240
..."You call this a
Hollandaise sauce?!" glare.

21:36.440 --> 21:38.921
I don't care what you say,
I like theme shows!

21:38.956 --> 21:40.040
And I'm going to do them,
starting this Friday...

21:40.230 --> 21:41.831
...with "Frasier Crane takes a look...

21:41.866 --> 21:43.030
...at the consequences of infidelity!"

21:43.150 --> 21:45.800
You do, and I'll make you start
that show with classical music!

21:45.990 --> 21:48.890
Bartok's Concerto in C, I don't
care how much you hate it!

21:49.010 --> 21:54.010
-Damn you!
-It's my way, or no way.

21:55.110 --> 21:58.110
You win. Bartok it is.

21:59.020 --> 22:00.712
What do you two want?

22:00.747 --> 22:03.720
-Nothing.
-Keep up the good work.
