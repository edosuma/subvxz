the security footage?

08:03.115 --> 08:05.017
No.

08:05.084 --> 08:06.452
Back camera was disabled

08:06.519 --> 08:08.120
and there was nothing
on the one out front,

09:35.441 --> 09:37.410
You need medical attention.

09:35.441 --> 09:37.410
I'm fine.

09:37.476 --> 09:39.645
You're hypertensive. Elevated

10:01.167 --> 10:03.002
Okay.

Stay.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.096
(sighs) No.

10:30.162 --> 10:32.098
I went through the records
Army CID sent over,

10:32.164 --> 10:35.401
but there's no obvious
point of contact between them.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.403
What about
the missing DEA agent?

10:37.470 --> 10:39.739
Santino know her?

10:37.470 --> 10:39.739
Not that I can see.

10:39.805 --> 10:42.608
There's got to be a reason
he took those two.

10:42.675 --> 10:44.477
What do we know
about Foster?

10:44.543 --> 10:46.345
She has been with DEA

10:46.412 --> 10:47.513
just over eight years.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.348
Solid agent, good record.

10:49.415 --> 10:51.150
But where's she detailed?

10:49.415 --> 10:51.150
Um...

10:51.217 --> 10:54.620
task force going after
black market opioids.

10:54.687 --> 10:56.956
There's been a big uptick
on the island,

10:57.023 --> 10:59.058
especially with
military personnel.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.493
Santino's Army.

11:00.559 --> 11:02.028
He could be a target
of the investigation.

11:02.094 --> 11:04.830
Well, if he is,
they're not sharing.

11:04.897 --> 11:06.465
Even Tennant got red-taped.

11:06.532 --> 11:07.700
Bet she didn't like that.

11:07.767 --> 11:09.502
No.
She went to pay them a visit

11:09.568 --> 11:11.537
in person with Whistler.

11:11.604 --> 11:13.839
Figured a little FBI muscle
couldn't hurt.

11:13.906 --> 11:15.441
They better get
some answers.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.711
I hate to say it, but
if we don't get Chase back soon,

11:18.778 --> 11:21.147
we might not
get her back at all.

11:27.119 --> 11:30.122
Don't try anything.

11:27.119 --> 11:30.122
(clippers snap)

11:30.189 --> 11:32.992
Yes. You've made that
abundantly clear.

11:37.396 --> 11:39.899
Multiple lacerations.

11:39.965 --> 11:44.370
Deep penetration
from a relatively low angle.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.238
Is this your doing?

11:47.406 --> 11:49.375
I wouldn't need you
if it was.

11:50.342 --> 11:52.311
Then how did you end up with
this unfortunate woman's body

11:52.378 --> 11:53.813
in a freezer
in the middle of the woods?

11:53.879 --> 11:56.315
I got a text last night

11:56.382 --> 11:58.517
telling me to meet Agent Foster
at her house.

11:58.584 --> 12:00.553
Agent?

12:00.619 --> 12:02.688
She's DEA, but I-I...

12:02.755 --> 12:04.690
I swear, she was dead
when I got there.

12:04.757 --> 12:06.125
So the obvious next
move on your part was

12:06.192 --> 12:08.427
to steal the body
and kidnap a medical examiner?

12:08.494 --> 12:10.763
I didn't do it!
I just...

12:10.830 --> 12:12.498
I just need you to prove it.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.000
And how do you expect me
to do that?

12:15.067 --> 12:16.902
Autopsies, tests.
You know?

12:16.969 --> 12:19.105
whatever it is you people do.

12:16.969 --> 12:19.105
All of which require

12:19.171 --> 12:22.408
sophisticated medical equipment.

12:19.171 --> 12:22.408
No...

12:22.475 --> 12:24.677
isn't an option, Doc.

12:25.644 --> 12:28.347
Trust me, I got nothing to lose.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.782
I'll do what I can,

12:29.849 --> 12:33.786
but you may not
like what I find.

12:33.853 --> 12:36.188
Let's just hope
you're wrong about that.

12:37.523 --> 12:38.924
For both our sakes.

12:38.991 --> 12:40.860
I can't do anything
without the proper tools.

12:40.926 --> 12:43.295
So I'll give you a list.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.298
(indistinct chatter)

12:48.200 --> 12:49.668
My contact at DEA
was tight-lipped

12:49.735 --> 12:51.003
about this task force.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.038
She heard they're
about to be shut down.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.473
She say why?

12:54.540 --> 12:57.309
Only that the agency seems
to be in cover-your-ass mode.

12:57.376 --> 12:58.944
Oh.

12:57.376 --> 12:58.944
Hey!

12:59.011 --> 13:00.980
Who the hell are you?
You can't be in here.

13:01.046 --> 13:03.015
Jane Tennant, Special
Agent in Charge, NCIS.

13:03.082 --> 13:04.683
This is Kate Whistler
with FBI.

13:04.750 --> 13:05.784
And we wouldn't be
crashing your party

13:05.851 --> 13:07.286
if you returned our calls.

13:07.353 --> 13:09.088
We've been a little busy.

13:07.353 --> 13:09.088
TENNANT: Looking for your

13:09.155 --> 13:10.789
missing agent? We've been
doing that, too.

13:10.856 --> 13:13.759
Agent Foster and Commander Chase
don't have time

13:13.826 --> 13:15.094
for jurisdictional games.

13:15.161 --> 13:16.829
It's a lot more complicated
than that.

13:16.896 --> 13:18.364
We can handle complicated.

13:18.430 --> 13:20.399
Look, I'll go as far over
your heads as necessary

13:20.466 --> 13:22.568
to find Commander Chase,
or...

13:23.369 --> 13:25.738
...we can all be professionals
and start cooperating.

13:27.273 --> 13:30.242
Come on, guys. Isn't this thing
messed-up enough already?

13:30.309 --> 13:32.311
Let's start over.

13:33.379 --> 13:35.681
I'm Supervisory Special Agent
Jerry Covington.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.550
This is
Special Agent Kendra Vreeland.

13:37.616 --> 13:39.185
And the bullheaded one's
Ned Ross.

13:39.251 --> 13:41.720
Thing is, Bree Foster
isn't just missing.

13:41.787 --> 13:43.489
She was murdered.

13:43.556 --> 13:46.091
That bastard
Santino killed her.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.760
I warned Bree not to trust him.

13:47.826 --> 13:48.861
They knew each other?

13:48.928 --> 13:50.196
Santino was her informant.

13:50.262 --> 13:51.931
It's why we kept the murder
under wraps.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.532
We're close to
figuring out the source

13:53.599 --> 13:55.868
of these black market opioids
and shutting them down.

13:55.935 --> 13:56.902
Well, what's Santino's
connection?

13:56.969 --> 13:58.003
ROSS:
A few weeks ago,

13:58.070 --> 13:59.538
Bree and I picked him up.

13:59.605 --> 14:01.373
He had a baggie of the opioids
we've been chasing.

14:01.440 --> 14:02.875
Santino is an addict.

14:02.942 --> 14:04.944
Started dealing on the side
to afford his habit.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.112
He agreed to identify
his main supplier

14:07.179 --> 14:08.647
in exchange for
a lighter sentence.

14:08.714 --> 14:10.216
And it was working.
We're close.

14:10.282 --> 14:12.551
And you're sure the sergeant
killed Agent Foster?

14:12.618 --> 14:14.253
Got his picture to prove it.

14:15.221 --> 14:17.923
That's Bree's home,
just after 11:00 last night.

14:17.990 --> 14:20.859
And this is
from this morning.

14:20.926 --> 14:23.662
Santino have a motive?

14:23.729 --> 14:26.198
VREELAND:
He'd just found out we were
gonna report everything to CID.

14:26.265 --> 14:28.033
Probably looking at
a dishonorable discharge

14:28.100 --> 14:29.335
even though he cooperated.

14:29.401 --> 14:30.336
Must've been pissed.

14:30.402 --> 14:32.304
And blamed Bree.

14:32.371 --> 14:33.739
Okay, wait.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.274
Where's Agent Foster's body?

14:37.576 --> 14:39.044
Santino took it.

14:40.112 --> 14:42.414
Wait, your CI
killed his handler,

14:42.481 --> 14:44.883
took her body and then
abducted a medical examiner?

14:44.950 --> 14:47.253
You might have wanted to lead
with that.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.231
Any word?

14:57.563 --> 14:59.231
TENNANT: No.

14:59.298 --> 15:01.166
But task force is getting us
everything they have

15:01.233 --> 15:03.869
on Sgt. Santino
and Agent Foster's murder.

15:03.936 --> 15:05.371
There's got to be
more we can do.

15:06.605 --> 15:08.274
Look.

15:08.340 --> 15:10.609
Carla is one of the most
formidable women I know,

15:10.676 --> 15:12.478
and she's smart.

15:12.544 --> 15:13.812
She can take care of herself.

15:13.879 --> 15:17.082
(sighs) You really believe
she's okay?

15:18.417 --> 15:20.119
I'm trying to.

15:22.054 --> 15:23.589
Do you have something?

15:23.656 --> 15:25.557
Yeah.

15:25.624 --> 15:29.128
I may have figured out why
Sgt. Santino took Chase.

15:30.162 --> 15:33.799
One of Santino's Army buddies
died last year from an overdose.

15:33.866 --> 15:36.201
The assumption was
that it was suicide.

15:36.268 --> 15:37.970
But Chase disagreed?

15:36.268 --> 15:37.970
She proved

15:38.037 --> 15:39.972
he had an anaphylactic
reaction to the drug.

15:40.039 --> 15:41.640
His death was tragic

15:41.707 --> 15:43.309
but accidental.

15:43.375 --> 15:45.311
So no reason for Santino
to hold a grudge.

15:45.377 --> 15:46.812
Just the opposite.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.950
He abducted a medical examiner
whose opinion he trusts.

15:52.017 --> 15:53.719
Feels like he's trying to see
if Chase can prove

15:53.786 --> 15:55.254
that he didn't kill Foster.

15:55.321 --> 15:56.889
VREELAND:
Then he's gonna
be disappointed,

15:56.955 --> 15:59.124
'cause it's pretty certain
he did.

15:59.191 --> 16:00.526
A security cam shot of him
at the front door

16:00.592 --> 16:01.593
isn't much evidence.

16:01.660 --> 16:03.395
There is plenty more.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.397
Then why don't we have it?

16:03.462 --> 16:05.397
Because the guys are
dragging their feet,

16:05.464 --> 16:08.267
hoping to catch Santino first
and put this thing to bed,

16:08.334 --> 16:10.135
keep the task force
from being shut down.

16:10.202 --> 16:11.804
ERNIE:
Commander Chase

16:11.870 --> 16:12.971
could be in danger.

16:13.038 --> 16:15.040
Which is why I'm here.

16:15.107 --> 16:17.209
You got some place
we can plug this in?

16:19.111 --> 16:21.146
Based on blood spatter,
we think

16:21.213 --> 16:23.115
Foster got stabbed
multiple times.

16:23.182 --> 16:24.783
Did you find
the murder weapon?

16:24.850 --> 16:28.921
No. Ross thinks Santino
used his combat knife.

16:29.788 --> 16:31.957
Body was dragged out back.

16:32.024 --> 16:34.059
Boot prints are Santino's size.

16:34.126 --> 16:37.029
He didn't try very hard
to cover his tracks.

16:37.863 --> 16:40.399
Probably high,
not thinking straight.

16:41.834 --> 16:45.070
Hey, boss,
I, uh, talked to Santino's unit.

16:45.137 --> 16:47.940
Kai, this is Special Agent
Vreeland with the DEA.

16:48.907 --> 16:50.709
You all cooperating with us now?

16:50.776 --> 16:53.011
Some of us, anyway.

16:54.513 --> 16:55.748
All right.

16:55.814 --> 16:57.983
None of the guys
in Santino's unit

16:58.050 --> 16:59.518
have heard from him.

16:59.585 --> 17:01.887
Said he'd been pretty erratic
the last six months.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.055
VEERLAND:
Happens when that monkey

17:03.122 --> 17:04.289
lands on your back.

17:04.356 --> 17:05.724
Nothing but the addiction
matters.

17:05.791 --> 17:07.493
Yeah. I did get a name.

17:07.559 --> 17:12.131
Russ Novak, a dealer
they'd seen Santino with.

17:12.197 --> 17:13.732
Yeah, we know Novak.

17:13.799 --> 17:15.300
Real scumbag.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.403
Targets combat veterans
who are already struggling.

17:17.469 --> 17:18.670
Did Novak serve?

17:18.737 --> 17:20.806
No, but he talks the talk.

17:20.873 --> 17:21.974
Makes the guys trust him.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.342
Why haven't you picked him up?

17:23.409 --> 17:25.544
Because what we really want
is his supplier.

17:25.611 --> 17:28.647
Santino was getting tight with
Novak, trying to get a name.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.382
All right, well,
if they're close,

17:30.449 --> 17:33.218
then maybe Novak knows
where Santino's taken Chase.

17:33.285 --> 17:35.154
We need to talk to him.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.790
You do that,
he could suspect we're onto him.

17:37.856 --> 17:39.258
Maybe warn his supplier.

17:39.324 --> 17:41.994
Months of the task force's
work blown to hell.

17:43.095 --> 17:45.531
Thought you wanted to help
save Commander Chase.

17:50.235 --> 17:52.905
All right, that's everything.

17:52.971 --> 17:54.206
I'm not sure
what you expect from me.

17:54.273 --> 17:55.974
Your DNA's already
all over the body.

17:56.041 --> 17:58.710
I don't know, just...
something.

17:58.777 --> 18:01.847
Whatever I find
won't even hold up in court.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.849
SANTINO:
Got it. It's hopeless.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.884
So let's just end it now.

18:05.951 --> 18:07.319
Hmm?

18:10.289 --> 18:11.890
Perhaps I should have
been clearer.

18:11.957 --> 18:13.625
I need human medical supplies.

18:13.692 --> 18:15.260
I got what I could.

18:15.327 --> 18:16.728
Breaking into your lab
at Pearl Harbor

18:16.795 --> 18:18.597
didn't seem like the best plan.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.567
How interesting.

18:22.701 --> 18:23.969
What?

18:24.036 --> 18:26.672
Around the wound there,
that odd chafing.

18:28.540 --> 18:31.076
You see it?

18:31.143 --> 18:32.377
This one?

18:33.812 --> 18:35.848
Drop the gun, now.

18:35.914 --> 18:37.316
Do it.

18:37.382 --> 18:39.384
Do it!

18:37.382 --> 18:39.384
You think I won't?

18:42.721 --> 18:45.457
Go ahead.

18:45.524 --> 18:47.593
I'm finished anyway.

18:49.661 --> 18:52.030
Did you kill Agent Foster?

18:53.632 --> 18:55.234
No.

18:56.768 --> 18:59.037
She tried to help me.

19:00.873 --> 19:03.275
She was the only
one that cared.

19:09.081 --> 19:11.016
(sighs)

19:11.083 --> 19:12.618
Put that damn thing away.

19:12.684 --> 19:14.286
(scalpel clatters)

19:18.824 --> 19:20.158
What are you doing?

19:21.093 --> 19:22.761
An excellent question.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.464
One I don't quite
have the answer to myself.

19:26.598 --> 19:28.433
Step aside, soldier,
and tell me everything you did

19:28.500 --> 19:31.303
from the moment
you entered Agent Foster's home.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.580
♪ ♪

19:41.647 --> 19:43.315
KAI:
I spent way too many nights

19:43.382 --> 19:45.384
in bars like this when I served.

19:45.450 --> 19:47.853
Really? Didn't figure you
for a party guy.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.155
Why not? I'm-I'm fun.

19:51.156 --> 19:53.292
Sure.

19:51.156 --> 19:53.292
I'm f...

19:53.358 --> 19:54.927
Also, there wasn't
much else to do

19:54.993 --> 19:56.662
at most of the posts
I was stationed.

19:56.728 --> 19:58.830
You know, bars are
actually the best place

19:58.897 --> 20:00.799
to get into fights.

20:00.866 --> 20:03.969
Like, on purpose?

20:00.866 --> 20:03.969
Sometimes.

20:04.036 --> 20:07.940
I was working through a lot of
anger issues back then, okay?

20:08.006 --> 20:09.575
There's Novak.

20:09.641 --> 20:12.811
Those guys he's with
can't be any older than 22.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.213
KAI:
Novak's trying
to get them hooked.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.349
Bar fight actually sounds
pretty good right now.

20:17.416 --> 20:18.584
Hey, it's gonna have to wait.

20:18.650 --> 20:20.218
If Novak can help us
track down Santino,

20:20.285 --> 20:22.087
we might find Chase.

20:22.154 --> 20:23.522
Nice and easy, all right?

20:26.191 --> 20:27.926
Cool.
There anything you want, man?

20:27.993 --> 20:29.227
Y'all ready to do this?

20:29.294 --> 20:31.196
GUY:
Definitely interested.

20:29.294 --> 20:31.196
Cool.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.773
Hey, we just
want to talk, man, okay?

20:41.840 --> 20:44.009
That right?

20:41.840 --> 20:44.009
Yeah.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.744
(people exclaiming)

20:45.811 --> 20:48.213
So much for nice and easy.

20:49.681 --> 20:51.650
(shrieks)

20:51.717 --> 20:53.118
Hey. You all right?

20:53.885 --> 20:55.120
Go, go, go!

21:01.727 --> 21:03.629
(grunting)

21:10.902 --> 21:12.604
You okay?

21:12.671 --> 21:14.873
Uh, yeah.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.541
Novak, freeze!

21:16.608 --> 21:18.410
(gunshots)

21:18.477 --> 21:20.145
DEA!

21:24.449 --> 21:27.619
This the part where
you guys say thank you?

21:37.562 --> 21:39.297
COVINGTON:
I should have been consulted
before your team went

21:39.364 --> 21:40.732
after Novak.

21:39.364 --> 21:40.732
We have different priorities.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.300
Ours is finding Commander Chase.

21:42.367 --> 21:43.769
You think we don't
want that, too?

21:43.835 --> 21:45.103
I'm sure you do.

21:45.170 --> 21:46.605
But you're also
protecting months of work

21:46.672 --> 21:47.606
that you've put
into this investigation.

21:47.673 --> 21:49.041
ROSS:
Damn right we are.

21:49.107 --> 21:51.176
And we needed Novak to
identify his supplier.

21:51.243 --> 21:53.445
Then maybe you shouldn't
have gone in guns blazing.

21:53.512 --> 21:54.880
This is on you.

21:54.946 --> 21:56.815
You're just lucky
we were there watching Novak.

21:56.882 --> 21:58.283
We could have handled it.

21:58.350 --> 21:59.618
Sure as hell
didn't look like it.

21:58.350 --> 21:59.618
TENNANT: Okay!

21:59.685 --> 22:01.386
Arguing is getting us no closer

22:01.453 --> 22:03.355
to finding Santino or Chase.

22:03.422 --> 22:04.656
So back off.

22:04.723 --> 22:06.358
Santino killed Bree.

22:06.425 --> 22:08.994
We'll find him
and bring him to justice.

22:09.061 --> 22:10.395
Is this about justice
or revenge?

22:11.963 --> 22:14.299
It's about getting the job done,

22:14.366 --> 22:16.702
which is what I'm gonna do.

22:21.339 --> 22:22.674
We are wasting time.

22:24.042 --> 22:26.011
We need to pool
our resources, Jerry.

22:26.078 --> 22:29.314
All hands on deck.
No holding back.

22:30.782 --> 22:32.517
All right.

22:32.584 --> 22:35.287
Not sure how it'll help,
but everything we have is yours,

22:35.353 --> 22:37.556
as long as
it's a two-way street.

22:37.622 --> 22:38.657
Of course.

22:39.424 --> 22:41.760
I'll let our people know.

22:39.424 --> 22:41.760
TENNANT: Thanks.

22:42.961 --> 22:45.063
It's how we should have played
this from the beginning.

22:50.669 --> 22:51.970
Here.

22:52.037 --> 22:54.740
I found this next to the...

22:54.806 --> 22:56.408
next to Agent Foster.

22:58.910 --> 23:00.879
Yes, that could certainly
be the weapon

23:00.946 --> 23:02.814
that caused the injuries.

23:02.881 --> 23:05.417
Just have no idea how
it got there, though.

23:05.484 --> 23:09.020
(sniffles)

23:05.484 --> 23:09.020
Do you recognize this knife?

23:10.322 --> 23:12.758
You agreed
to tell me everything.

23:13.959 --> 23:15.761
How much worse could it be?

23:16.862 --> 23:18.764
I-It's mine.

23:18.830 --> 23:20.332
It went missing a few days ago.

23:20.398 --> 23:23.702
I stand corrected, that makes it
much worse for you.

23:23.769 --> 23:25.270
I was set up.

23:25.337 --> 23:26.638
And who would do that?

23:26.705 --> 23:28.640
My dealer and his supplier.

23:26.705 --> 23:28.640
Mm.

23:28.707 --> 23:31.510
They must have found out that
I was working with the feds

23:31.576 --> 23:34.446
and killed her and
framed me for it. I...

23:36.848 --> 23:39.384
(scoffs)
You don't believe me.

23:40.385 --> 23:42.854
I try to make no assumptions.

23:48.660 --> 23:49.861
It's not what you think.

23:49.928 --> 23:51.296
Oh, I'm certain it is.

23:51.363 --> 23:52.998
Buprenorphine.

23:53.064 --> 23:56.635
Helps alleviate the symptoms
from opioid withdrawal.

23:56.701 --> 23:59.004
Been clean 21 days.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.909
It's a good start.

24:04.910 --> 24:08.113
It's been hell.
The pain.

24:08.180 --> 24:11.149
The memories just...
all coming back.

24:11.216 --> 24:13.285
Oh, that trauma
never really went away.

24:13.351 --> 24:15.520
Yeah, but I could
forget it for a while.

24:15.587 --> 24:19.591
IED explosion in Afghanistan
took out half my unit.

24:19.658 --> 24:22.060
I ended up full of shrapnel.

24:23.094 --> 24:25.697
The pain-- you got no idea.

24:26.631 --> 24:29.134
About ready to give up
before I started the oxy.

24:29.201 --> 24:31.436
Opioids can be miracle drugs.

24:32.470 --> 24:34.005
Until they're not.

24:38.076 --> 24:40.212
Agent Foster...

24:40.278 --> 24:43.181
convinced me
I could kick the habit.

24:44.783 --> 24:46.952
She had faith in me

24:47.018 --> 24:49.254
even when I didn't.

24:51.223 --> 24:53.525
You must really hate me.

24:55.026 --> 24:56.394
Bringing you here like this.

24:56.461 --> 24:58.864
I spent ten years
patching up soldiers like you

24:58.930 --> 25:01.166
on the front lines.

25:02.567 --> 25:05.270
I understand despair.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.839
Known it myself.

25:07.906 --> 25:10.442
But you didn't let it ruin you.

25:11.209 --> 25:13.712
I found my own ways to cope.

25:13.778 --> 25:15.547
Healthy ways.

25:16.681 --> 25:18.283
You can, too.

25:20.852 --> 25:23.021
I doubt I'll get that chance.

25:24.823 --> 25:27.425
Not if you don't
find something here.

25:28.894 --> 25:33.198
Then why don't you step away
and let me do my job.

25:45.443 --> 25:46.544
Good morning.

25:46.611 --> 25:48.847
Hey. It's morning?

25:48.914 --> 25:51.116
Yep, and Lucy told me
she usually brings you

25:51.182 --> 25:53.885
a pick-me-up
after all-nighters.

25:53.952 --> 25:56.488
Portuguese sausage
and egg sandwich?

25:56.554 --> 25:57.989
Better.

25:58.890 --> 26:02.427
Almonds
with vitamin B and magnesium

26:02.494 --> 26:03.828
for muscle fatigue.

26:03.895 --> 26:07.132
Hard-boiled eggs,
iron and protein.

26:07.198 --> 26:10.468
And sugar-free dark chocolate,

26:10.535 --> 26:11.569
a natural stimulant.

26:11.636 --> 26:13.605
ERNIE (yawning):
Ah, looks delicious.

26:13.672 --> 26:15.807
Oh, and just in case,

26:15.874 --> 26:18.743
this is a double
double espresso.

26:18.810 --> 26:20.612
Ooh, that'll work.

26:21.680 --> 26:24.316
I think I may have actually
just found something.

26:25.583 --> 26:28.453
Been trying to figure out
where Santino might take Chase.

26:28.520 --> 26:30.722
Well, he hasn't been
in Hawai'i long, has he?

26:28.520 --> 26:30.722
No.

26:30.789 --> 26:32.590
He was mostly stationed abroad
until recently.

26:32.657 --> 26:34.225
Well, not surprising
for a ranger.

26:34.292 --> 26:36.461
But he was here eight years ago

26:36.528 --> 26:38.863
for a jungle operations
training course.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.999
WHISTLER:
Interesting.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.169
But a military facility
doesn't seem a likely place

26:44.235 --> 26:45.537
to hold Chase, does it?

26:45.603 --> 26:47.605
Except that particular
training facility

26:47.672 --> 26:48.940
isn't operational anymore.

26:49.007 --> 26:51.142
It's been closed down
for years.

26:52.010 --> 26:53.545
(exhales sharply)

26:53.611 --> 26:55.580
It's in the middle of nowhere--
perfect place to hide.

26:55.647 --> 26:58.650
Okay, so I'm not delirious
from lack of sleep?

26:58.717 --> 27:01.720
Definitely not.
Okay, I'll call Tennant.

27:01.786 --> 27:04.255
You finish that double double,
you earned it.

27:10.095 --> 27:11.496
Mm-hmm.

27:17.902 --> 27:19.371
SANTINO:
That mean you're done?

27:19.437 --> 27:21.673
As much as I can do here, yes.

27:21.740 --> 27:23.842
And?

27:23.908 --> 27:26.644
Almost certainly, your knife
was the murder weapon.

27:27.645 --> 27:29.547
And those injuries

27:29.614 --> 27:31.316
did cause her death.

27:31.383 --> 27:33.852
Which means I'm screwed.

27:33.918 --> 27:36.755
I did notice one unusual thing.

27:39.557 --> 27:40.759
Well?

27:40.825 --> 27:42.427
Oh, are you interested?

27:42.494 --> 27:44.396
I was under the impression
that you'd already given up.

27:44.462 --> 27:47.832
Just tell me
what you found, Doc.

27:47.899 --> 27:49.200
A small puncture wound.

27:49.267 --> 27:50.702
Nearly invisible.

27:50.769 --> 27:52.871
Easy to miss.

27:50.769 --> 27:52.871
So, uh...

27:52.937 --> 27:54.439
so, what does that mean?

27:54.506 --> 27:56.708
She was injected with something?

27:56.775 --> 27:57.942
It appears so.

27:58.977 --> 28:01.746
But I won't know what until
I get her back to my lab

28:01.813 --> 28:04.416
and run the necessary tests.

28:05.917 --> 28:07.685
Is this another trick?

28:07.752 --> 28:09.054
What if it is?

28:09.120 --> 28:10.588
You're running out
of options, Sergeant.

28:10.655 --> 28:12.924
Right now, I'm the only person
even willing to consider

28:12.991 --> 28:14.526
you might be innocent.

28:22.767 --> 28:24.169
Anything?

28:22.767 --> 28:24.169
Nothing yet.

28:24.235 --> 28:25.437
Kai's still searching.

28:25.503 --> 28:27.072
The facility's spread
over several acres,

28:27.138 --> 28:28.807
so there's a lot
of ground to cover.

28:28.873 --> 28:30.241
How many structures?

28:30.308 --> 28:31.876
Only a few.
Some of them have fallen apart.

28:31.943 --> 28:34.312
No, uh, task force?

28:34.379 --> 28:36.514
I thought it best to keep it
a little more low-key.

28:36.581 --> 28:39.084
You didn't want those hotheads
shooting anyone else, huh?

28:39.150 --> 28:41.586
Especially not if Chase might
get caught in the crossfire.

28:42.387 --> 28:44.022
KAI: Jesse, you copy?

28:42.387 --> 28:44.022
Yeah, I'm here.

28:44.089 --> 28:45.323
Tennant's with me.

28:45.390 --> 28:46.591
I think I found them.
There's a car

28:46.658 --> 28:47.759
parked out front
of the old mess hall.

28:48.593 --> 28:50.395
Okay, hold tight.
We're on our way.

28:56.968 --> 28:58.336
Hey.

28:58.403 --> 29:00.271
You see Chase or Santino?

29:00.338 --> 29:01.606
I can't confirm it's them,

29:01.673 --> 29:03.541
but I see two people
moving back and forth.

29:05.677 --> 29:08.379
All right, let's move in.
Careful not to spook him.

29:14.486 --> 29:16.821
Uh, how do I know
I can trust you?

29:16.888 --> 29:20.291
I think me not cutting
your throat was a good start.

29:20.358 --> 29:23.461
You're not just gonna
leave, turn me in?

29:23.528 --> 29:24.729
No.

29:24.796 --> 29:26.798
Though I'd advise you
to do that yourself,

29:26.865 --> 29:28.233
before it's too late.

29:34.172 --> 29:35.874
Come on.

29:44.349 --> 29:45.550
What did you do?

29:44.349 --> 29:45.550
What-what do you mean? I...

29:45.617 --> 29:46.951
You lied.

29:45.617 --> 29:46.951
Sergeant, be smart.

29:47.018 --> 29:48.253
Shut up!

29:50.054 --> 29:51.523
Stay away!

29:55.260 --> 29:56.494
(grunts)

29:56.561 --> 29:59.297
Was any of that real?

29:56.561 --> 29:59.297
I haven't

29:59.364 --> 30:00.798
lied to you.
Please, just give yourself up.

30:00.865 --> 30:04.435
I am not going to jail
for something I didn't do!

30:04.502 --> 30:06.604
I'll talk to the police.

30:04.502 --> 30:06.604
That's not gonna do any good.

30:06.671 --> 30:09.374
Nobody'll listen.
Not to an addict.

30:10.875 --> 30:12.644
I'll listen.

30:16.814 --> 30:19.384
Get back.

30:20.718 --> 30:21.953
I'm unarmed.

30:22.921 --> 30:25.056
Hey, why don't we
find a way out of this

30:25.123 --> 30:27.292
where nobody gets hurt?

30:38.670 --> 30:41.272
Let's just all
take a breath here, okay?

30:44.108 --> 30:45.577
How you holding up?

30:45.643 --> 30:47.545
Eh, I been through worse.

30:47.612 --> 30:49.080
Really?

30:49.147 --> 30:50.715
You'll have to
tell me about that sometime.

30:50.782 --> 30:52.684
Get out. Now.

30:52.750 --> 30:54.886
Is this really how you want
to play things, Sergeant?

30:54.953 --> 30:56.721
Better to leave in a body bag
than in cuffs.

30:56.788 --> 30:59.157
Maybe we can come up
with another option.

31:00.291 --> 31:03.995
Why don't you tell me
about Agent Foster's murder?

31:05.630 --> 31:07.031
I'm being set up.

31:07.098 --> 31:09.234
They're making me look like
some crazy nutjob.

31:09.300 --> 31:11.436
Okay, well, you're not exactly
proving them wrong.

31:12.237 --> 31:14.806
You have to the count
of three. One...

31:14.872 --> 31:15.840
Jane, you should know
that I think

31:15.907 --> 31:17.108
he may be telling the truth.

31:17.175 --> 31:18.776
What, that he'll shoot
after three?

31:18.843 --> 31:21.112
No, that's-that's a bluff.

31:18.843 --> 31:21.112
Two!

31:21.179 --> 31:25.149
I mean it.

31:21.179 --> 31:25.149
CHASE: Sergeant Santino
was likely set up.

31:26.251 --> 31:29.654
I conducted an autopsy and...

31:29.721 --> 31:31.055
though admittedly not performed

31:31.122 --> 31:33.124
at the highest
professional standards,

31:33.191 --> 31:34.926
it did raise questions

31:34.993 --> 31:37.095
which I can only answer
in my lab.

31:37.161 --> 31:39.530
You're just saying that
to get out of here.

31:40.965 --> 31:42.533
Okay, look, how
about a compromise?

31:42.600 --> 31:46.471
Let Commander Chase go,
see what she can figure out.

31:47.939 --> 31:49.841
And I'll stay here with you.

31:52.977 --> 31:54.812
Should we call in REACT?

31:54.879 --> 31:56.514
JESSE:
Nah, give it a beat.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.783
If there's anyone that can talk
this guy down, it's Tennant.

31:58.850 --> 32:00.852
Heads up, I see movement.

32:02.987 --> 32:04.455
If you gentlemen
would lend me a hand.

32:06.257 --> 32:08.159
What about Tennant?

32:06.257 --> 32:08.159
She's safe for now.

32:08.226 --> 32:09.794
But I need to get to
the AFMES office right away.

32:09.861 --> 32:12.096
She may not have much time.

32:13.798 --> 32:15.533
Oh, sorry.

32:13.798 --> 32:15.533
Hey.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.835
I-I was just heading over
to Commander Chase's office.

32:17.902 --> 32:19.137
She and Kai
are on the way there now.

32:19.203 --> 32:20.305
She's okay?

32:19.203 --> 32:20.305
Yeah,

32:20.371 --> 32:21.539
but now Tennant
is trapped in there

32:21.606 --> 32:22.740
with that Army Ranger.

32:22.807 --> 32:24.409
Chase thinks he's being set up.

32:24.475 --> 32:26.377
Wait, that might fit
with why I'm here.

32:26.444 --> 32:28.146
I found some of
Agent Foster's notes

32:28.212 --> 32:29.547
that weren't with
the official case file.

32:29.614 --> 32:31.783
She was working on
a wiretap for a guy

32:31.849 --> 32:33.818
named George Bedalyan.

32:33.885 --> 32:34.919
Who's George Bedalyan?

32:34.986 --> 32:37.088
I was hoping you knew.

32:37.155 --> 32:38.990
His name isn't anywhere
in the case file.

32:39.057 --> 32:40.825
Her notes say
why he was important?

32:40.892 --> 32:42.527
She believed he's the supplier

32:42.593 --> 32:44.729
of the black market opioids
they've been looking for.

32:45.530 --> 32:47.965
Wait, you think the task force
didn't give us everything?

32:48.766 --> 32:51.869
Or someone scrubbed Bedalyan's
name from all the reports.

32:51.936 --> 32:53.571
I'll see Chase later.

32:53.638 --> 32:55.673
We have to find out what
we can about George Bedalyan

32:55.740 --> 32:57.508
and get it to Tennant.

33:00.745 --> 33:02.347
Aw, damn it.

33:02.413 --> 33:03.915
There's no word
from the doc yet?

33:03.981 --> 33:05.750
She's barely had time
to get back there.

33:05.817 --> 33:06.951
(phone vibrates)

33:07.018 --> 33:09.053
What's up?

33:09.120 --> 33:10.154
JESSE:
Hey, yeah, we've got company.

33:10.221 --> 33:12.156
DEA just arrived in full force.

33:13.057 --> 33:14.425
Tell them to hold back.

33:14.492 --> 33:16.461
I'll tell 'em, not
too confident they'll listen.

33:16.527 --> 33:17.729
You called them?

33:17.795 --> 33:19.630
No, but we're gonna
work it out, Owen.

33:19.697 --> 33:21.799
They think that I killed her.

33:21.866 --> 33:23.000
Just keep calm.

33:23.067 --> 33:24.635
I will talk to them

33:24.702 --> 33:26.404
and explain what's going on.

33:30.541 --> 33:32.443
JESSE:
Covington, keep
your agents back.

33:32.510 --> 33:35.213
Why the hell weren't we notified
you located Santino?

33:35.279 --> 33:36.647
You'll get your chance with him

33:36.714 --> 33:38.216
soon as we get this situation
under control.

33:38.282 --> 33:40.985
Control? You let him
take your boss hostage.

33:41.052 --> 33:42.453
We're handling it.

33:42.520 --> 33:43.755
Yeah.

33:42.520 --> 33:43.755
Hey.

33:43.821 --> 33:45.356
Is Tennant okay in there?

33:47.058 --> 33:49.127
She's fine.

33:52.096 --> 33:53.498
I'm never getting out of here.

33:53.564 --> 33:54.832
Yes, you will.

33:54.899 --> 33:57.502
Look. I'm here
to make sure of it.

33:57.568 --> 33:59.737
They think I killed
their partner.

33:59.804 --> 34:01.139
They want me dead.

34:01.205 --> 34:04.175
(scoffs) Not the worst
way to go, I guess.

34:06.511 --> 34:07.612
"I will always

34:07.678 --> 34:12.116
"endeavor to uphold
the prestige, honor,

34:12.183 --> 34:14.952
and high esprit de corps
of the Rangers."

34:15.887 --> 34:17.655
You swore that creed.

34:17.722 --> 34:19.590
I lived by it, too.

34:21.225 --> 34:22.794
But I wasn't strong enough.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.796
Your battle's not over yet.

34:24.862 --> 34:28.099
Look, just give my people time
to find the truth.

34:39.644 --> 34:41.879
(sighs) Things are tense
out there, Commander.

34:41.946 --> 34:43.881
We have to hurry.

34:41.946 --> 34:43.881
I'm fully aware of

34:43.948 --> 34:45.917
the necessity for haste.

34:46.884 --> 34:49.387
So, you think she was drugged
before she was stabbed?

34:49.454 --> 34:51.322
Possibly, and
if she was,

34:51.389 --> 34:53.124
it might have
incapacitated her.

34:53.191 --> 34:54.525
Made her vulnerable.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.160
Giving the killer
the opportunity

34:56.227 --> 34:57.728
to strike her from the front.

34:57.795 --> 35:00.164
Which seems too premeditated
for the crime of passion

35:00.231 --> 35:01.899
this was assumed to be.

35:01.966 --> 35:07.171
If you're right, Sgt. Santino
was the perfect fall guy.

35:07.238 --> 35:09.707
Of course, that's just
all theory without proof.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.682
We need to talk to Tennant.

35:17.748 --> 35:19.450
TENNANT:
Owen.

35:19.517 --> 35:21.018
It doesn't have to go down
like this.

35:21.085 --> 35:22.386
(phone vibrates)

35:21.085 --> 35:22.386
Maybe it does.

35:22.453 --> 35:23.855
Maybe this is how
it always had to end.

35:23.921 --> 35:25.056
Tennant.

35:25.122 --> 35:26.157
CHASE:
I was right.

35:26.224 --> 35:27.692
Agent Foster was injected

35:27.758 --> 35:29.660
with a high dose of
suxamethonium chloride.

35:29.727 --> 35:31.829
Okay, how would that
have affected her?

35:31.896 --> 35:33.364
It's used in anesthesia.

35:33.431 --> 35:35.366
Even small amounts results
in temporary paralysis.

35:35.433 --> 35:38.302
Which explains why she didn't
have any defensive wounds.

35:38.369 --> 35:41.439
And you said the injection point
was from behind her?

35:41.506 --> 35:42.740
CHASE: Yes.

35:41.506 --> 35:42.740
So she must have known

35:42.807 --> 35:43.908
her attackers and that's
why they had to

35:43.975 --> 35:46.177
incapacitate her first.

35:47.078 --> 35:48.513
Thanks, Carla.

35:49.547 --> 35:51.048
Told you
we'd find out the truth.

35:51.115 --> 35:52.984
Not sure the truth matters.

35:53.050 --> 35:54.752
Those guys are out for blood.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.921
No way they let me
walk out of here alive.

35:56.988 --> 36:00.358
Trust me.
I'll make it happen.

36:01.492 --> 36:03.394
Tennant talked Santino
into giving himself up.

36:03.461 --> 36:05.863
Tell your people to stand down,
they're coming out.

36:05.930 --> 36:07.164
Lower your weapons.

36:15.206 --> 36:16.374
I got him.

36:16.440 --> 36:17.341
No, he surrendered.
He's coming with us.

36:17.408 --> 36:18.609
Commander Chase is no longer

36:18.676 --> 36:20.344
in danger.
This is DEA's case now.

36:20.411 --> 36:22.547
You said I'd be safe.

36:20.411 --> 36:22.547
And you will be.

36:22.613 --> 36:25.149
We have reason to believe
that Sgt. Santino

36:25.216 --> 36:27.218
is not responsible
for your agent's murder.

36:27.285 --> 36:28.519
You got evidence,
we'll take a look.

36:28.586 --> 36:30.755
Until then,
get him out of here.

36:31.822 --> 36:33.958
You promised.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.626
ROSS:
Shut your mouth.

36:35.693 --> 36:37.094
COVINGTON:
We have Santino.

36:35.693 --> 36:37.094
Don't worry.

36:37.161 --> 36:38.563
I won't let anything
happen to him.

36:38.629 --> 36:40.364
I want everything ready
when we get him there.

36:41.198 --> 36:43.067
Don't let him
out of your sight.

36:43.134 --> 36:44.769
(doors close)

36:43.134 --> 36:44.769
You okay?

36:44.835 --> 36:47.271
It's not me I'm worried about.

36:57.348 --> 36:58.416
Hey.

36:58.482 --> 36:59.617
Any movement there?

36:59.684 --> 37:00.718
JESSE:
Santino's still inside

37:00.785 --> 37:02.186
with the task force.

37:02.253 --> 37:03.487
They're probably trying
to get him to confess.

37:03.554 --> 37:04.522
He won't.

37:04.589 --> 37:05.623
They'll have to transfer him

37:05.690 --> 37:06.791
to FDC Honolulu soon.

37:06.857 --> 37:07.825
And you think
whoever's behind this

37:07.892 --> 37:09.260
will try something?

37:09.327 --> 37:11.996
If Santino's dead
and unable to mount a defense,

37:12.063 --> 37:14.465
Agent Foster's murder
will be blamed on him.

37:14.532 --> 37:16.133
What about Chase's evidence?

37:16.200 --> 37:18.035
It's only enough to create
doubt, not enough to clear him.

37:18.102 --> 37:20.805
Look, call if anything changes.

37:23.107 --> 37:24.308
Hey.

37:24.375 --> 37:25.910
So, what do we know about
this opioid supplier

37:25.977 --> 37:27.311
that Foster suspected?

37:27.378 --> 37:28.913
His name's George Bedalyan.

37:28.980 --> 37:31.482
He runs
an import-export business

37:31.549 --> 37:33.050
that deals mostly in foods.

37:33.117 --> 37:35.486
But we dug into his financials
and they don't add up.

37:35.553 --> 37:38.923
If Foster was right about
him smuggling in the opioids,

37:38.990 --> 37:40.591
he's been getting away with it
for years.

37:40.658 --> 37:42.126
Because he's had help
on the inside.

37:42.193 --> 37:43.628
Whoever it was
that scrubbed Bedalyan's name

37:43.694 --> 37:45.062
from the case file.

37:45.129 --> 37:47.198
Has to be someone
on the task force then, right?

37:47.264 --> 37:49.333
Right, and that's why
Agent Foster

37:49.400 --> 37:51.335
was keeping
her suspicions to herself.

37:51.402 --> 37:53.571
She thought one of
her colleagues was involved.

37:53.638 --> 37:55.106
(computer beeps)

37:56.874 --> 37:58.009
The wiretap.

37:58.075 --> 37:59.510
Agent Foster wrote
an affidavit

37:59.577 --> 38:01.379
for a wiretap on Bedalyan
before she was killed,

38:01.445 --> 38:03.581
and her information was enough
for me to get one approved.

38:03.648 --> 38:05.683
The call's coming from a burner.

38:05.750 --> 38:07.685
BEDALYAN:
It's about time.

38:07.752 --> 38:08.953
You gonna be able
to take care of this?

38:09.020 --> 38:10.521
VEERLAND:
Yeah, but it's risky.

38:10.588 --> 38:13.591
I'll expect a big bonus
in addition to my usual payment.

38:13.658 --> 38:15.292
BEDALYAN:
You'll get it.

38:15.359 --> 38:16.594
(beep)

38:16.661 --> 38:17.862
Oh, she didn't identify herself.

38:17.928 --> 38:19.697
She didn't need to.

38:25.703 --> 38:27.171
Uh, what's-what's
going on?

38:27.238 --> 38:29.040
Taking you
to the detention center.

38:29.106 --> 38:30.207
Just you?

38:30.274 --> 38:31.475
Yeah.

38:32.276 --> 38:36.013
You're not gonna give me
any problems, are you?

38:38.015 --> 38:40.117
TENNANT:
Drop it, Vreeland.

38:44.689 --> 38:46.157
What the hell is this?

38:46.223 --> 38:48.259
You're under arrest
for the murder of Bree Foster.

38:49.694 --> 38:50.895
What?

38:50.961 --> 38:53.164
(chuckles)
That's crazy.

38:53.230 --> 38:55.332
We already got
George Bedalyan in custody.

38:55.399 --> 38:57.702
Looks like you won't be
collecting that bonus.

38:57.768 --> 38:59.470
COVINGTON:
It's true?

38:59.537 --> 39:01.872
I told Special Agent Tennant

39:01.939 --> 39:03.307
she had to be mistaken.

39:07.878 --> 39:09.447
Get me out of here.

39:09.513 --> 39:13.217
Jesse, Kai,
escort Ms. Vreeland inside.

39:14.051 --> 39:16.487
I'm sure her colleagues
have some questions for her.

39:23.360 --> 39:25.096
You came through.

39:25.162 --> 39:27.264
I always keep my promises.

39:28.833 --> 39:31.869
I've still got
a lot to answer for.

39:34.305 --> 39:36.307
Hey.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.510
The Army's gonna
get you the help you need.

39:39.577 --> 39:42.079
But it's gonna be up to you
to do the work.

39:43.414 --> 39:45.249
Okay.

39:43.414 --> 39:45.249
Let's get you out of here.

39:54.959 --> 39:56.594
(singsongy):
Hey there.

39:56.660 --> 39:58.896
Ha...

39:58.963 --> 40:00.898
Can't tell you
how happy I am to see you.

40:00.965 --> 40:02.700
Ah, I was gonna
come find you.

40:02.767 --> 40:04.201
You must have
thought me very rude

40:04.268 --> 40:05.803
for standing you up
for morning yoga.

40:05.870 --> 40:07.071
So rude.

40:07.138 --> 40:09.006
I nearly erased you
from my contacts.

40:09.073 --> 40:10.975
I heard you were
rather relentless

40:11.041 --> 40:12.610
in making sure I was found.

40:12.676 --> 40:14.245
I couldn't lose you.

40:14.311 --> 40:16.947
Who else would go see
centipede exhibits with me?

40:17.014 --> 40:18.149
(chuckles)

40:19.383 --> 40:20.417
How are you?

40:21.418 --> 40:23.254
I'm okay. Now.

40:23.320 --> 40:26.223
There's still time to catch that
sunset yoga class, if you want.

40:26.290 --> 40:30.227
(scoffs)
I had something else in mind.
