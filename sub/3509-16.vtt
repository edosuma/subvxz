00:19.729 --> 00:20.449
Can't you...

00:21.289 --> 00:21.542
Can't...

00:22.013 --> 00:24.681
Just at least tell me how serious it is.

01:05.795 --> 01:07.830
What's with the stripped cab?

01:07.864 --> 01:09.765
Security guard wondered the same thing.

01:09.799 --> 01:11.734
That's when he came across the body.

01:11.768 --> 01:12.807
Who's our victim?

01:12.808 --> 01:14.900
Amir Alhabi, taxi driver.

01:15.403 --> 01:17.354
All right. Contact auto theft.

01:17.389 --> 01:18.730
Have 'em on the lookout for
these stolen car parts.

01:18.731 --> 01:19.620
Already done.

01:23.828 --> 01:26.397
Was there money on the body?
Not on the body, not in the cab.

01:26.431 --> 01:29.333
Everything points to him being
popped for cash and car parts.

01:29.367 --> 01:31.051
Not everything, baby.

01:31.102 --> 01:34.338
Did you just call him baby?
Ooh, did I?

01:34.372 --> 01:36.640
Anyway, you found something unusual?

01:36.675 --> 01:39.024
Not at first. Time of death fits a robbery.

01:39.025 --> 01:40.437
He was killed at 11:15.

01:41.088 --> 01:43.256
So specific. I'm impressed.

01:43.291 --> 01:44.602
His watch broke when he fell.

01:44.603 --> 01:45.518
Ah, you shouldn't have told me.

01:45.519 --> 01:47.885
Less impressed. 
Cause of death fits, too.

01:47.886 --> 01:49.882
Looks like a 9-millimeter to the noggin.

01:49.883 --> 01:51.616
But there's something that doesn't fit.

01:51.617 --> 01:54.898
His fingers... were broken one at a time.

01:54.899 --> 01:56.628
Cabbies sometimes hide their money.

01:56.629 --> 01:58.882
Maybe they tortured him to
tell them where the money was.

01:58.883 --> 02:00.346
All right, let's find out
where he was driving

02:00.347 --> 02:02.272
and who he picked up
before he wound up here.

02:02.965 --> 02:03.947
Amir Alhabi...

02:03.948 --> 02:05.912
He's a real immigrant success story.

02:05.913 --> 02:08.339
Came over from Syria seven years ago

02:08.340 --> 02:10.323
because a citizen last June.

02:10.324 --> 02:11.870
According to the taxi and limo commission,

02:11.871 --> 02:14.903
he owned his cab and medallion
with a cousin... Jamal.

02:17.574 --> 02:19.071
Um... right.

02:19.417 --> 02:21.919
W-well, T.L.C. would know
where Amir was, right?

02:21.920 --> 02:23.782
They track cabs?
Only when the meter is running.

02:23.783 --> 02:25.612
Amir shut his off at 10:02 P.M.

02:25.613 --> 02:26.378
So there's no way to tell

02:26.379 --> 02:28.342
where he went before he died.
Actually, there is.

02:28.343 --> 02:30.790
Amir subscribed to a GPS tracking service.

02:30.791 --> 02:32.494
It helps cabbies map out the best place

02:32.495 --> 02:34.120
to troll for fares, stuff like that.

02:34.121 --> 02:36.362
Anyway, after Amir shut off his meter,

02:36.363 --> 02:37.862
he drove up to Washington Heights.

02:37.863 --> 02:40.269
He parked in the 1600 block
of St. Nicholas Avenue

02:40.270 --> 02:42.882
for six minutes, motor running,
then he drove to the warehouse.

02:43.655 --> 02:46.738
Okay, Washington Heights is a shady place

02:46.739 --> 02:49.046
that time of night, and if
he turned off his meter,

02:49.047 --> 02:51.931
he wasn't looking for a fare.
Maybe he was carjacked

02:51.932 --> 02:53.407
and forced to drive to that warehouse.

02:53.408 --> 02:55.253
All right, have unis canvass the area.

02:55.254 --> 02:56.979
See if anyone remembers seeing him.

02:56.980 --> 02:58.141
What about his last phone call?

02:58.142 --> 03:00.625
10:01 to his wife...
Nazihah Alhabi.

03:00.626 --> 03:02.523
Okay. Let's go.

03:02.524 --> 03:04.846
Actually, there was one
more thing on the phone.

03:04.847 --> 03:07.181
Amir opened a notebook application,

03:07.182 --> 03:08.877
and he, uh, wrote down this.

03:08.878 --> 03:12.509
Uh, "C4121652,"

03:12.510 --> 03:15.051
and it was written down just
about an hour before he died.

03:15.052 --> 03:16.113
And it's not a license tag.

03:16.989 --> 03:18.562
All right. See if you can figure it out.

03:18.596 --> 03:21.765
I got it. Seven digits...
It's a phone number.

03:21.799 --> 03:24.124
"C" is the initial of the
person to whom it belongs.

03:24.125 --> 03:25.992
I already tried that.
With all the New York area codes?

03:26.026 --> 03:27.660
Yeah. - Intriguing. 
Maybe...

03:27.694 --> 03:29.812
Castle.
Coming.

03:31.000 --> 03:31.810
Mrs. Alhabi,

03:31.811 --> 03:34.178
we understand that Amir
called you at 10:00.

03:34.212 --> 03:37.281
What did the two of you talk about?
Just that he'd be late.

03:37.315 --> 03:39.216
The plays were getting out on Broadway,

03:39.251 --> 03:40.956
and he wanted to pick up more fares.

03:40.957 --> 03:43.791
Actually, he didn't do that.
He turned his meter off

03:43.826 --> 03:46.389
and he went up to Washington Heights.

03:46.390 --> 03:50.541
That part of town is known for
drug dealing and prostitution.

03:50.542 --> 03:52.237
No, he would never do such things.

03:54.700 --> 03:55.835
Jamal, thank you.

03:55.836 --> 03:58.897
Uh, there was an annotation
on Amir's phone.

03:58.898 --> 04:00.434
Do you have any idea what this is?

04:02.082 --> 04:04.198
"C4121652."

04:05.054 --> 04:07.737
No, I-I thought this was a
robbery, that he was robbed.

04:07.738 --> 04:11.307
It was. It's just, any minor
detail might be relevant.

04:11.308 --> 04:12.476
How did he seem lately?

04:12.477 --> 04:14.542
Worried about money.

04:14.543 --> 04:17.837
Malika, our daughter, she needed surgery.

04:17.838 --> 04:19.741
It's been very hard.

04:21.392 --> 04:23.198
She'll never know her father.

04:25.737 --> 04:27.104
Please excuse me.

04:32.854 --> 04:35.161
Jamal, you and Amir were business partners?

04:35.438 --> 04:37.063
How was the business doing?

04:37.064 --> 04:40.136
You don't get rich driving
a cab, but we made money.

04:40.137 --> 04:42.931
Amir drove, and we rented
shifts to other drivers.

04:42.932 --> 04:43.858
And who were they?

04:43.859 --> 04:47.373
Uh, Kevin McCann and, uh, Dimitri Voldov.

04:47.374 --> 04:48.721
So you didn't drive the cab?

04:48.722 --> 04:50.897
For me, the taxi medallion
was an investment.

04:50.898 --> 04:53.288
I just started a new
business, a moving company.

04:53.289 --> 04:55.773
T.L.C. doesn't issue a lot of medallions.

04:56.044 --> 04:57.929
It would've been worth a small fortune.

04:57.930 --> 04:59.964
So who inherits Amir's share?

04:59.965 --> 05:02.145
Nazihah will. She'll need it.

05:03.953 --> 05:06.003
Excuse me. Beckett.

05:06.004 --> 05:08.542
Auto theft got a hit on
the stolen car parts.

05:08.543 --> 05:11.187
A guy named Leeman Jones was
selling 'em at a chop shop.

05:11.188 --> 05:13.550
V.I.N. number on the parts
matches our cab.

05:13.551 --> 05:15.608
Where's Jones now?
Interrogation.

05:15.609 --> 05:18.884
I found those car parts.
On the car that you stripped.

05:18.885 --> 05:21.537
We have a witness who
places you at the scene,

05:21.571 --> 05:23.755
so please just stop with the lying.

05:23.790 --> 05:24.602
A witness?

05:25.094 --> 05:28.277
Okay, I stripped that taxi. It's what I do.

05:28.278 --> 05:30.096
After you killed the driver.
After I what?

05:30.130 --> 05:33.383
No, I didn't kill any driver
'cause there was no driver.

05:33.417 --> 05:36.069
He was left in the warehouse.
Robbed and shot in the head.

05:36.120 --> 05:37.520
Well, not by me, okay?

05:37.554 --> 05:40.189
I was cruisin' and I saw the cab
sitting empty, and I figure,

05:40.224 --> 05:42.225
no sense in letting good parts go to waste.

05:42.259 --> 05:43.576
What time was that?

05:43.610 --> 05:46.840
I don't know. About 11:15 probably.

05:46.841 --> 05:49.137
Oh. Well, there you go.
That's right when he died.

05:49.138 --> 05:50.577
Look, no. I don't hurt people.

05:50.578 --> 05:52.382
I'm just a car guy.

05:53.230 --> 05:55.982
Your witness must've done it. 
That's it.

05:55.983 --> 05:58.577
And now he's just playing
innocent bystander or something.

05:59.695 --> 06:01.063
There was no witness.

06:02.832 --> 06:03.594
What do you mean?

06:03.595 --> 06:05.445
I was bluffing. 
Bluffing?

06:05.446 --> 06:06.579
Yes. 
No.

06:06.580 --> 06:09.178
She's allowed to do that.
I'm surprised you don't know that.

06:09.179 --> 06:10.766
No, I mean there was a guy there.

06:10.767 --> 06:12.858
I saw him. 
What guy? Describe him.

06:12.859 --> 06:15.007
I didn't get a clear look.
He ran off when I pulled up.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.161
But he was there.

06:16.162 --> 06:17.947
He was there looking for
something in the car.

06:17.948 --> 06:20.956
What makes you say that?
Because he did a number on the interior.

06:20.957 --> 06:22.568
He tore up the upholstery.

06:23.993 --> 06:25.091
Think he's telling the truth?

06:25.092 --> 06:26.936
That guy does not have the improv skills

06:26.937 --> 06:29.479
to make up a lie like that.
Have C.S.U. check the car

06:29.480 --> 06:31.613
for signs that someone else tampered with it.
You got it.

06:35.313 --> 06:37.995
Uh... sorry, you guys. I gotta get this.

06:40.130 --> 06:41.303
Not now, Ryan.
Uh...

06:41.304 --> 06:42.885
What's going on with her?

06:42.886 --> 06:45.621
You know Beckett.
She plays it close to the vest.

06:53.208 --> 06:54.459
So I, uh, spoke

06:54.460 --> 06:56.889
to one of the drivers who rents
a shift with Amir's cab.

06:56.890 --> 06:59.852
Kevin McCann.
Uh, no, the other one... Dimitri Voldov.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.684
He alibied out, but he had
lots to say about McCann.

07:02.685 --> 07:04.839
Him and Amir got in a
major fight two days ago.

07:04.840 --> 07:06.949
About what?
Well, Dimitri didn't know.

07:06.950 --> 07:09.432
But Amir told him he was gonna fire McCann.

07:09.433 --> 07:10.692
And where's McCann now?

07:10.693 --> 07:12.281
Renting a shift at allied taxi.

07:15.239 --> 07:16.949
So I'll... I'll tell Beckett that.

07:16.950 --> 07:18.137
Could you? That'd be best. 
Yeah.

07:19.056 --> 07:21.795
Amir and I had words.
No law against that, right?

07:21.796 --> 07:24.718
Where were you last night at 11:15?

07:24.719 --> 07:25.840
In this cab

07:25.841 --> 07:28.947
driving a drunk bond trader
to the Upper West. Why?

07:28.948 --> 07:31.174
Well, because that's when he was murdered.

07:31.175 --> 07:32.947
Oh, you're kidding me.

07:34.299 --> 07:36.689
Look, I didn't lay a hand on that guy.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.148
Why did you and he fight two days ago?

07:38.149 --> 07:39.809
Because he was raping me on rent.

07:39.810 --> 07:41.059
Look, the guy could afford it.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.424
He was flashing a roll
that could choke a horse.

07:43.425 --> 07:45.280
Had 5 grand, easy.

07:45.281 --> 07:48.385
Wait. Was he known for carrying
around that much money?

07:49.123 --> 07:50.531
First I saw of it.

07:51.899 --> 07:55.114
Look, um, are we done here?
Because my meter's running.

07:56.175 --> 07:58.581
If Amir was struggling
to pay medical bills...

07:58.582 --> 08:01.084
What was he doing with that much cash?
It's Esposito.

08:01.085 --> 08:03.041
He needs us back at the crime scene asap.

08:03.042 --> 08:05.173
Remember Leeman Jones
said that some other dude

08:05.174 --> 08:06.568
messed with the cab?
 Uh-huh.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.232
Well, C.S.U. just figured out why.

08:09.843 --> 08:11.229
The car had cameras.

08:11.230 --> 08:13.688
Pinhole cameras, microphones, too.

08:13.689 --> 08:15.646
Great. All we have to do
is rewind to last night,

08:15.647 --> 08:17.805
see who was after him, case closed.
We can't.

08:17.806 --> 08:21.062
They ripped out the hard drives
with all the video data.

08:25.431 --> 08:26.905
What the hell is going on here?

08:37.217 --> 08:39.443
Strange thing is, Amir's wife,

08:39.443 --> 08:41.046
his cousin, other drivers...

08:41.047 --> 08:43.710
None of them knew
that he'd installed those cameras.

08:43.711 --> 08:45.335
Maybe Amir was doing a reality show.

08:45.336 --> 08:47.424
See, I thought that, too,
but turns out, no.

08:47.425 --> 08:49.603
And they weren't installed
by law enforcement either.

08:49.604 --> 08:53.314
You think someone was spying on him.
Or his passengers, or both.

08:53.972 --> 08:56.453
Maybe it's like in "The Conversation,"

08:56.454 --> 08:57.946
and he overheard a murder plot.

08:58.734 --> 09:00.017
Whatever it is, it's juicy.

09:00.018 --> 09:02.281
Have, you, uh, have you
talked to your father

09:02.282 --> 09:03.919
about our little trip? 
Not yet.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.162
Well, what are you waiting for?

09:05.163 --> 09:08.951
I have scored two
incredibly-hard-to-get spots

09:08.952 --> 09:10.418
at the Oasis of Serenity.

09:10.419 --> 09:12.195
That's fantastic.

09:12.196 --> 09:14.488
What is that?
You haven't heard of the Serenity?

09:15.112 --> 09:19.093
It's a spiritual retreat.
Oh, it's nestled in the catskills.

09:19.094 --> 09:20.903
It's a sanctuary, a place for reflection,

09:20.904 --> 09:22.380
getting in touch with your inner self.

09:22.381 --> 09:25.987
Well, in... in your case, is that wise?
Gram wants to shed her ego

09:25.988 --> 09:27.845
in preparation for teaching
her acting classes.

09:27.846 --> 09:31.496
Yes, and who better to do
that with than Alexis?

09:31.497 --> 09:35.086
We will stay in luxury yurts, we
will have meditation classes,

09:35.087 --> 09:37.372
yoga classes. 
We go tomorrow night.

09:37.373 --> 09:40.915
That is, if you will allow her.
Oh, well, I suppose...

09:40.916 --> 09:42.927
Physics. Fizzy... physic...

09:42.928 --> 09:45.505
Physics. Physics exam.
Don't you have a physics exam?

09:45.506 --> 09:48.689
My... my physics exam.
I almost forgot.

09:48.690 --> 09:50.368
It's on Monday morning.
I haven't studied.

09:50.369 --> 09:51.972
And it counts for 20% of my grade.

09:52.763 --> 09:54.012
20%.

09:54.532 --> 09:56.935
Carpe diem. Seize the day.

09:56.936 --> 09:59.204
Clearly I didn't teach that to my son.

09:59.205 --> 10:01.920
All right, darling. 
Well, another time.

10:01.921 --> 10:06.051
I guess I will just have to
find my inner self by myself.

10:06.052 --> 10:07.396
Mm. I can do it.

10:09.518 --> 10:11.965
Best dad ever.

10:16.039 --> 10:18.054
Yeah.

10:18.072 --> 10:18.990
Yeah, I get that.

10:18.991 --> 10:21.072
And once in a while, if you were here,

10:21.073 --> 10:21.988
that would be great.

10:24.512 --> 10:25.956
Can we do this later?

10:25.957 --> 10:27.001
Bye.

10:28.661 --> 10:29.508
Hey.

10:29.509 --> 10:30.260
Hey.

10:31.564 --> 10:33.124
What brings Motorcycle Boy here?

10:33.512 --> 10:35.446
Doctor Motorcycle Boy.

10:35.481 --> 10:38.132
Does he need a reason?
It just looked personal.

10:38.167 --> 10:40.251
It was. Where are we on
those hidden cameras?

10:40.285 --> 10:42.720
Just that they were installed by a pro.
Techs are running

10:42.738 --> 10:44.482
the serial numbers now to find
out where they came from.

10:44.483 --> 10:46.700
A guy with surveillance in his cab,

10:46.751 --> 10:48.596
too much money in his pocket...
The whole thing feels hinky.

10:48.597 --> 10:51.149
Based on his financials,
it looks hinky, too.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.768
Guy had medical bills up the wazoo.

10:53.803 --> 10:56.454
But then there's this from five days ago.

10:57.570 --> 10:59.619
A cash deposit for $10,000?

10:59.620 --> 11:02.254
What's a struggling cab driver
doing with that kind of cash?

11:04.055 --> 11:05.998
Yo. I just found something weird.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.939
I logged in to Amir's GPS account

11:07.940 --> 11:09.851
to track where he drove the day he died.

11:09.852 --> 11:12.865
At 4:07 P.M., Amir picked up a cash fare

11:12.866 --> 11:14.901
at 15th and Avenue of the Americas.

11:14.902 --> 11:16.352
What's weird about that? 
Well,

11:16.353 --> 11:18.623
the passenger rode for 26
minutes, then got dropped off

11:18.624 --> 11:20.369
at the same corner where
Amir picked him up.

11:20.370 --> 11:22.649
Now who would pay 30
bucks to go in a circle?

11:22.650 --> 11:24.366
Someone who wanted to talk to Amir.

11:24.367 --> 11:26.185
Check those traffic cameras.
See if we can get a look

11:26.186 --> 11:27.607
at that passenger.
 On it, captain.

11:27.608 --> 11:28.382
Sir.

11:29.937 --> 11:32.479
We got a match on those
cameras hidden in Amir's cab.

11:32.480 --> 11:35.282
Cameras were ordered a week
ago by a Techno-Pro Systems.

11:37.110 --> 11:38.790
I don't know what you
guys are talking about.

11:38.791 --> 11:40.526
I didn't install any hidden cameras.

11:40.527 --> 11:42.089
Your name's on the purchase order.

11:42.090 --> 11:43.361
As is your signature.

11:43.362 --> 11:45.934
You violated the expectation
of privacy act.

11:45.935 --> 11:47.137
Do you know that I can arrest you for that?

11:47.138 --> 11:50.672
Ohh. Yeah. I mean... I mean, no.
Or you could just tell her

11:50.706 --> 11:53.291
who hired you to install the
surveillance equipment.

11:53.325 --> 11:55.994
I promised him I'd keep it on the D.L. 
Who hired you?

11:56.028 --> 11:58.208
Amir Alhabi.

11:59.246 --> 12:00.198
You put it in for Amir?

12:00.232 --> 12:02.834
Yeah. Why would he have you
put cameras in his cab?

12:02.868 --> 12:04.436
Security reasons.

12:04.470 --> 12:06.571
That's all he said.

12:06.605 --> 12:08.339
Yo, cap.

12:08.374 --> 12:10.341
Caught a break on our mystery passenger...

12:10.375 --> 12:13.144
Off a traffic cam near where Amir
dropped the guy off.

12:13.179 --> 12:14.646
Notice anything?

12:16.243 --> 12:18.494
He's carrying. 
Yeah, and he's not police.

12:18.495 --> 12:20.830
Suit's way too fancy.
Canvass where this was taken.

12:20.864 --> 12:23.199
See if anyone knows who he is.

12:23.233 --> 12:25.635
I keep track of the expenses for the cab.

12:25.669 --> 12:28.805
There was never any bill for cameras.
What about the $10,000?

12:28.839 --> 12:30.540
The first time I heard
about the money is today.

12:30.541 --> 12:32.320
I can't imagine where it came from.

12:32.321 --> 12:34.597
Money, cameras, Washington Heights...
Nazihah,

12:34.598 --> 12:36.856
your husband was clearly
hiding something from you.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.508
Do you have any idea what it was?

12:38.509 --> 12:40.806
No. No, I don't understand this at all.

12:40.807 --> 12:42.664
Okay. Do you recognize this man?

12:42.665 --> 12:46.249
He rode in your husband's cab.
Yes.

12:46.250 --> 12:48.388
Y-yes, he was here.

12:48.389 --> 12:49.674
When? 
Last week.

12:49.675 --> 12:51.894
He and Amir were talking in the street.
Who was he?

12:51.895 --> 12:53.888
I asked Amir. He said that the man

12:53.889 --> 12:55.283
had mistaken him for someone else.

12:55.284 --> 12:58.889
Amir clearly knew the guy.
Why would he lie to her?

12:58.890 --> 13:01.012
And how does he end up dead

13:01.013 --> 13:04.404
the same day this guy rides in his cab?
Beckett.

13:04.405 --> 13:06.555
We just got a hit on our canvass
for the mystery passenger.

13:06.556 --> 13:07.897
We got a name on that face?

13:07.898 --> 13:10.696
He's a big fan of this coffee shop on 14th.

13:10.697 --> 13:12.976
He shows up every afternoon
for an espresso at 2:00.

13:12.977 --> 13:14.174
Sir.

13:14.175 --> 13:16.118
In the cream suit...
Stop!

13:17.022 --> 13:18.582
NYPD. Turn around.

13:26.478 --> 13:28.959
It's a 9-millimeter just
like our murder weapon.

13:28.960 --> 13:31.138
You have a concealed weapons permit?

13:32.338 --> 13:34.593
Inside left pocket of my jacket,

13:34.594 --> 13:36.150
along with my credentials.

13:40.589 --> 13:41.786
Fariq Yusef.

13:41.787 --> 13:43.345
Syrian consulate.

13:44.843 --> 13:46.064
At your service.

13:47.815 --> 13:48.949
Put your hands down.

13:48.950 --> 13:50.966
Thank you.
 Two days ago,

13:50.967 --> 13:53.178
you were driving in a cab
 with Amir Alhabi.

13:53.179 --> 13:56.799
He's been murdered.
I am saddened to hear that.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.366
You were in that cab for a half an hour.

13:58.367 --> 13:59.778
What's the nature of your relationship?

13:59.779 --> 14:02.641
I... I have diplomatic immunity.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.129
You have no standing questioning...
Who killed him? Was it you?

14:04.130 --> 14:07.072
Or detaining me. 
Answer my question. Did you kill him?

14:09.334 --> 14:11.102
I'd like my pistol, please.

14:11.103 --> 14:13.778
You can collect it at the 12th Precinct.

14:13.779 --> 14:15.343
And so I shall.

14:19.252 --> 14:21.194
Fariq Yusef's official
title at the Consulate

14:21.195 --> 14:22.198
is head of security.

14:22.199 --> 14:24.120
He's a member of the secret police.

14:24.121 --> 14:26.419
Well, he's probably broken
a few fingers in his day.

14:26.420 --> 14:28.343
And Yusef also owned a 9-millimeter gun,

14:28.344 --> 14:30.674
which was the same kind
of gun that killed Amir.

14:30.675 --> 14:32.487
Maybe Yusef recruited Amir,

14:32.488 --> 14:34.413
drew him in to the shadowy
world of espionage.

14:34.414 --> 14:37.191
Once he finished his mission,
his fate was sealed.

14:37.192 --> 14:39.431
Yusef killed him to tie up
loose ends, and then took

14:39.432 --> 14:41.943
the data drive containing
the explosive revelations.

14:41.944 --> 14:43.844
And that would be what exactly?

14:44.874 --> 14:48.072
I'm still thinking on that.
But it's a perfect fit.

14:48.073 --> 14:50.410
Yeah, except that Fariq
Yusef isn't the killer.

14:50.411 --> 14:52.934
Are you sure? Because that would
ruin a perfectly good theory.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.649
Yeah. The night Amir was killed,

14:54.650 --> 14:56.544
Fariq was with the Syrian ambassador

14:56.545 --> 14:58.355
at a soccer game at Bennett Field.

14:58.356 --> 14:59.886
There are photos online to prove it.

14:59.887 --> 15:01.954
Which brings us back to square one.

15:01.955 --> 15:05.984
Okay, so Amir and Yusef take
a tour of lower Manhattan,

15:05.985 --> 15:07.545
and then later on that same night,

15:07.546 --> 15:09.940
he calls his wife, tells her
that he's still working,

15:09.941 --> 15:12.455
and instead, went up to Washington Heights.

15:12.456 --> 15:14.056
Then he ends up dead at the warehouse

15:14.057 --> 15:15.233
with the data drive ripped out.

15:15.234 --> 15:18.313
C4121652.

15:18.314 --> 15:20.950
Amir took his cab down St. Nicholas Ave.

15:20.951 --> 15:23.412
To the 1600 block. He parked mid-block.

15:23.413 --> 15:24.060
So?

15:24.061 --> 15:25.720
So I'm just thinking,

15:25.721 --> 15:30.250
the 1652 part of C4121652 is an address.

15:30.251 --> 15:33.217
What's at St. Nicholas Ave. at 1652?

15:37.724 --> 15:39.289
North Manhattan Storage.

15:39.290 --> 15:41.144
C412 is a storage unit.

15:43.663 --> 15:46.045
Murder, political intrigue,

15:46.046 --> 15:48.825
cash payments, and now a
mysterious storage locker?

15:48.826 --> 15:50.966
Oh, this is too good.

15:53.234 --> 15:54.677
Wait. How are we gonna get it open?

15:55.704 --> 15:58.029
Well, if all else fails...

15:59.734 --> 16:02.560
For reasons too disturbing to mention,

16:02.561 --> 16:03.898
I-I find that hot.

16:03.899 --> 16:05.151
Or...

16:05.152 --> 16:08.351
I grabbed Amir's keys from property,

16:08.352 --> 16:10.888
so hopefully this is his locker.

16:13.760 --> 16:16.523
Which it is. 
What do you think's in there?

16:16.524 --> 16:19.817
I don't know.
Might be empty, like Al Capone's vault.

16:19.818 --> 16:21.448
Oh, no. Think of all the amazing things

16:21.449 --> 16:23.245
that are found in storage
units at times like this.

16:23.246 --> 16:26.172
The arc of the covenant, Dr. Jones?

16:34.152 --> 16:35.127
Well, the arc of the covenant

16:35.128 --> 16:35.873
was in a crate.

16:44.943 --> 16:46.022
Oh.

16:50.965 --> 16:52.606
Plastic explosives.

16:55.654 --> 16:58.484
Castle, get out! Get out! 
What?

16:58.485 --> 17:00.798
Go!
Why? What... I don't...

17:00.799 --> 17:02.654
Castle, back away from the door!
Get away!

17:02.655 --> 17:05.446
What is going on? What is that thing, Kate?

17:05.448 --> 17:07.916
This is detective Kate Beckett,
badge number 0-3-3-4.

17:07.917 --> 17:10.396
I've been exposed to high
levels of radiation.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.675
We need emergency services right away.

17:27.959 --> 17:29.794
Guys, you can't just...

17:29.828 --> 17:33.197
you can't... just at least
tell me how serious it is!

17:41.206 --> 17:42.921
How badly did they get hit? 
We don't know.

17:42.922 --> 17:44.392
But the best way for us to help them

17:44.443 --> 17:46.310
is to keep working on this case.

17:46.328 --> 17:49.530
Now our murder victim had a
key to this storage unit,

17:49.564 --> 17:52.049
so he was into a lot more
than driving a taxi.

17:52.084 --> 17:53.451
Dig deep into Amir Alhabi.

17:53.518 --> 17:55.453
Let's get his wife and his cousin in here.

17:55.487 --> 17:57.321
Meanwhile, I'll call the
Syrian Consulate and find out

17:57.356 --> 17:58.320
why Amir had contact with

17:58.321 --> 18:00.057
the head of security.
They won't talk to you.

18:00.923 --> 18:02.456
Whatever Alhabi was into,

18:02.491 --> 18:03.548
the Syrians don't want it

18:03.549 --> 18:05.409
blowing back on 'em.
Excuse me. Who are you?

18:05.444 --> 18:07.428
You must be captain Montgomery.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.730
I'm Mark Fallon, Department
of Homeland Security.

18:11.633 --> 18:14.635
D.H.S. sent me down here
to act as a liaison.

18:14.670 --> 18:16.971
I understand you have a situation.

18:19.464 --> 18:20.831
Those Hazmat teams?

18:21.300 --> 18:22.162
They're only staying in the building

18:22.163 --> 18:23.608
for about a minute at a time.

18:23.609 --> 18:25.542
Maybe it's just standard protocol.

18:26.570 --> 18:29.511
Yeah. Maybe it's just too
hot in there to handle.

18:35.054 --> 18:36.878
That radiation detector of yours,

18:36.879 --> 18:38.773
does it have a scale on it,

18:38.774 --> 18:41.775
you know, like chest X-ray to Chernobyl?

18:43.890 --> 18:44.956
Maxed out.

18:46.704 --> 18:47.868
Oh.

18:49.108 --> 18:51.199
We have to assume Alhabi
wasn't acting alone.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.479
Where are we on his wife and cousin?
She's on her way in.

18:53.480 --> 18:54.992
According to a neighbor,
Jamal went out drinking.

18:54.993 --> 18:56.177
We're trying to track him down.

18:57.380 --> 18:59.258
Amir either had the nuclear
material for himself

18:59.259 --> 19:00.790
or he was holding on to
it for someone else.

19:00.791 --> 19:02.846
Either way, odds are,
that's what got him killed.

19:02.847 --> 19:05.323
Check his phone records against
the terror watch list.

19:05.324 --> 19:06.664
We're already doing that. 
Excuse me.

19:06.665 --> 19:07.286
Yeah.

19:08.369 --> 19:09.446
Just so I'm clear,

19:10.666 --> 19:11.882
are you taking over?

19:11.883 --> 19:13.372
This is your case.

19:13.373 --> 19:15.518
I'm just here to lend
support however I can.

19:16.543 --> 19:18.937
Yo, cap, I.C.E. just sent over

19:18.938 --> 19:20.536
the immigration papers for Amir Alhabi.

19:20.537 --> 19:23.055
He got a degree in electrical engineering

19:23.056 --> 19:24.317
from a school in Damascus.

19:24.318 --> 19:26.589
What was he working on in Syria?
I got that one.

19:26.590 --> 19:28.611
I just spoke with the State Department.

19:28.612 --> 19:31.040
They debriefed Amir when
he first landed here.

19:31.041 --> 19:32.784
They say he was working
on a weapons program

19:32.785 --> 19:35.214
for the Syrians. 
Nuclear weapons?

19:35.215 --> 19:36.800
Yeah. 
Okay.

19:37.985 --> 19:39.223
Now I'm taking over.

19:40.938 --> 19:41.908
It's a bomb.

19:42.746 --> 19:44.650
There's a nuclear bomb in that locker.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.376
Castle, we don't know that it's a bomb.

19:46.377 --> 19:47.850
Well, we will as soon as it goes off,

19:47.851 --> 19:49.919
in that nanosecond before we're vaporized.

19:54.208 --> 19:54.980
I'm sorry.

19:54.981 --> 19:57.146
It's just the... the writer in me

19:57.147 --> 19:58.683
going to worst-case scenario.

19:58.684 --> 20:00.688
Can we just talk about something else?
Yeah.

20:04.447 --> 20:05.693
How's Josh?

20:06.827 --> 20:07.903
Fine.

20:08.920 --> 20:10.222
He's, um...

20:11.150 --> 20:12.740
He's on his way to Haiti

20:12.741 --> 20:15.240
to do another Doctors
Without Borders mission.

20:16.035 --> 20:17.183
How long?

20:18.192 --> 20:19.422
I don't know.

20:22.801 --> 20:24.144
It's so funny, Castle.

20:24.145 --> 20:26.075
You know, at first, I loved
that he was so busy.

20:26.076 --> 20:27.463
It just, um...

20:29.569 --> 20:32.723
Just gave me an opportunity to
keep one foot out the door,

20:32.724 --> 20:33.575
just in case.

20:34.872 --> 20:36.272
But with one foot out the door,

20:36.273 --> 20:38.569
it's hard to know where you stand.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.245
And even if I did, I
mean, what does it mean?

20:41.093 --> 20:43.327
He's out there. He's saving people.

20:43.328 --> 20:45.406
How do you even compete with that?

20:45.407 --> 20:48.465
You can't. 
No. No one can.

20:48.466 --> 20:49.357
That's one of the things

20:49.358 --> 20:51.290
that attracted me to him the most...

20:51.291 --> 20:53.777
That... passion,

20:53.778 --> 20:55.456
that drive.

20:57.211 --> 21:00.510
Why is it that the thing that
attracts you to a person

21:00.511 --> 21:01.851
always ends up being that thing

21:01.852 --> 21:03.558
that just drives you crazy?

21:05.585 --> 21:07.064
I just wish that...

21:08.067 --> 21:11.499
I wish that I had someone
who would be there for me,

21:11.500 --> 21:12.945
and I could be there for him,

21:12.946 --> 21:14.924
and we could just dive into it together.

21:24.598 --> 21:25.638
You're free to go.

21:26.735 --> 21:28.864
Uh, we are? 
What about the radiation?

21:28.865 --> 21:31.944
We found residual traces of
cobalt-60 in the storage unit.

21:31.945 --> 21:33.475
Not enough to cause any health problems.

21:42.503 --> 21:44.810
Detective Beckett, Castle,

21:44.811 --> 21:46.274
we're all real glad you two are okay.

21:46.275 --> 21:48.249
Thanks, sir. So are we.
I'm confused, though.

21:48.250 --> 21:49.564
Is this just a false alarm?

21:49.565 --> 21:51.417
Well, not exactly. If you're up to it,

21:51.452 --> 21:53.786
we really could use you
back at the precinct.

21:53.821 --> 21:54.454
I can fill you in on the way.

21:54.455 --> 21:57.840
Those traces of cobalt-60,
where did they come from?

21:57.875 --> 22:00.026
We think there was a second
crate at the storage unit,

22:00.060 --> 22:02.295
which contained large
quantities of cobalt-60.

22:02.329 --> 22:04.364
We found wire and crimp-on
connectors, which leads us

22:04.398 --> 22:06.933
to believe the crate was
outfitted with explosives.

22:06.967 --> 22:08.534
A bomb?

22:08.569 --> 22:10.169
A dirty bomb.

22:10.204 --> 22:12.305
Where is it now?

22:12.339 --> 22:14.540
That's what we're trying to find out.

22:23.016 --> 22:23.582
Hey, dad.

22:23.583 --> 22:24.622
Late night?

22:24.623 --> 22:26.990
Uh, still going.
I just came back to change my clothes.

22:26.991 --> 22:30.323
Well, bid my ego adieu.

22:30.324 --> 22:33.825
I am off to the Oasis, minus
Alexis, thanks to you.

22:33.826 --> 22:36.861
Actually, I changed my mind about that.
You have?

22:36.896 --> 22:40.165
You have? Yeah. I think it's
important you have time together.

22:40.199 --> 22:42.700
Oh, my faith in you is restored.

22:42.735 --> 22:44.919
Dad, what about my physics test?
I can't just leave.

22:44.954 --> 22:47.438
Yeah, sure you can. Just take 'em with you.

22:47.473 --> 22:49.243
I haven't packed or anything. I can't...
Oh,

22:49.244 --> 22:50.725
honey, everything is provided there.

22:50.759 --> 22:53.044
Oh, we're going to have so much fun.

22:53.078 --> 22:54.979
Come on. Let's get a bag.

22:55.014 --> 22:57.549
Go. It'll be... it'll be good for you.

23:14.613 --> 23:16.303
Due to the nature of this case,

23:16.304 --> 23:18.877
let me remind you not to
discuss it with anyone,

23:18.878 --> 23:20.068
not even family.

23:20.069 --> 23:22.953
We can't afford to have word
leak out and cause a panic.

23:22.954 --> 23:25.849
Let me turn this over to agent Fallon.

23:25.850 --> 23:27.638
Thank you, captain. 
All right, folks.

23:27.639 --> 23:29.588
Here's what we know...
Amir Alhabi built a bomb

23:29.623 --> 23:31.057
in storage unit c412.

23:31.091 --> 23:33.009
It's a dirty bomb, designed to explode

23:33.043 --> 23:36.979
and disperse highly
radioactive cobalt-60...

23:37.809 --> 23:39.393
And that bomb is missing...

23:40.501 --> 23:42.042
I called Jenny to tell her I'd be late.

23:42.043 --> 23:43.904
Tried to get her to go visit her mom.

23:43.905 --> 23:45.982
Yeah, I did the same thing with Lanie.

23:45.983 --> 23:47.839
Didn't work. She hates her mom. 
Mm.

23:47.840 --> 23:51.302
Interview facility employees,
check surveillance video,

23:51.303 --> 23:52.944
you know the drill.

23:52.945 --> 23:55.604
We find the person who moved the bomb,

23:56.840 --> 23:58.635
we'll find where it is.

23:59.569 --> 24:00.571
Let's get on it.

24:12.373 --> 24:13.313
Mr. Castle.

24:13.991 --> 24:15.892
I'd like to thank you for
your fine work on this case.

24:16.897 --> 24:19.898
However, I can't have
civilians on the front lines.

24:19.899 --> 24:21.931
It's as though I'm getting a raise

24:21.932 --> 24:23.315
and getting fired at the same time.

24:23.316 --> 24:24.961
Except for, you don't actually work here.

24:27.184 --> 24:28.472
It's for your own protection.

24:29.378 --> 24:30.815
Well, my friend the governor...

24:30.816 --> 24:32.038
will be very disappointed to hear it.

24:37.096 --> 24:37.856
Okay.

24:38.737 --> 24:40.741
Just try and stay out of the way.

24:40.742 --> 24:43.265
Detective Beckett, a word.

24:49.346 --> 24:50.543
He doesn't trust me.

24:50.544 --> 24:51.777
Or anyone else.

24:51.778 --> 24:53.414
Nature of the job.

24:54.259 --> 24:55.393
So how can I help?

24:57.170 --> 24:58.329
Amir's wife...

24:58.330 --> 25:00.156
How did she seem during the interview?

25:00.157 --> 25:02.891
Like a woman who had just lost her husband.

25:02.892 --> 25:04.803
Did she appear truthful?

25:04.804 --> 25:06.893
Mm-hmm, at the time she did.

25:06.894 --> 25:08.916
I'm gonna want you in there with me, okay?

25:09.980 --> 25:11.937
I think it's important she
sees a friendly face.

25:11.938 --> 25:14.475
If I go over the line, you
just reel me back in.

25:17.696 --> 25:18.978
That's a nice touch.

25:19.687 --> 25:20.900
What?

25:22.168 --> 25:23.102
The baby.

25:33.233 --> 25:34.691
Nazihah, this is agent Fallon.

25:35.771 --> 25:37.511
Do you have news about Amir's case?

25:37.512 --> 25:38.869
As a matter of fact, I do.

25:40.706 --> 25:44.344
That $10,000 was wired into Amir's account.

25:44.345 --> 25:47.409
Which means it can be traced.
Pull up the Trakfund database

25:47.410 --> 25:48.831
and put in the routing and account numbers.

25:52.274 --> 25:57.257
Whoa. Just downloaded footage
of unit C412

25:57.258 --> 25:58.509
for the last 48.

25:58.510 --> 25:59.911
Hopefully that's when somebody stopped by.

25:59.912 --> 26:01.849
An Arab terrorist. 
Who'd believe it?

26:01.850 --> 26:04.227
Thing back, bro. That's my point.
It's been done.

26:04.228 --> 26:06.787
Which means it's tried and true.
Not this time.

26:10.848 --> 26:11.783
Maybe it's not what we think.

26:11.784 --> 26:13.929
That $10,000 that was wired in, 
it's from a bank

26:13.930 --> 26:16.073
in Dearborn, Michigan, from a James Smith.

26:16.074 --> 26:18.609
That's the most common name in America.
It's probably bogus.

26:18.610 --> 26:20.062
Plus, there's a major
middle-eastern population

26:20.063 --> 26:22.542
in Dearborn. 
Four minutes before it was transferred out,

26:22.543 --> 26:25.281
it was transferred in from...

26:25.282 --> 26:28.109
James Smith, Texas Southern Bank.

26:28.110 --> 26:30.407
Whoever sent that 10 grand
covered his tracks

26:30.408 --> 26:32.568
by Daisy-chaining the money
through different banks.

26:32.569 --> 26:34.494
Didn't cover them that
well if I can follow them.

26:34.495 --> 26:36.566
Well, I bet Amir's wife
could shed some light

26:36.567 --> 26:37.898
and I hope that Fallon's going

26:37.899 --> 26:39.953
all Jack Bauer on her ass.
Maybe she didn't know.

26:39.954 --> 26:40.930
They were together, bro.

26:40.931 --> 26:42.736
Could you be a terrorist
without Jenny knowing?

26:46.576 --> 26:49.973
Amir was not a terrorist.
He loved this country.

26:49.974 --> 26:51.731
And yet he was in possession of...

26:51.732 --> 26:53.022
Where's the bomb, Mrs. Alhabi?

26:53.023 --> 26:55.662
I told you, I know nothing about a bomb.

26:55.663 --> 26:58.427
Amir would never do such a thing.
Why would he?

26:58.428 --> 27:02.977
He needed the cash.
That baby of yours is a money pit.

27:03.922 --> 27:05.425
The bills started piling up,

27:05.426 --> 27:06.634
and he got in bed with the wrong people.

27:06.635 --> 27:08.154
I need you to tell me who they were.

27:08.155 --> 27:09.837
I swear to you, I don't know.

27:09.838 --> 27:11.133
How can you not know

27:11.134 --> 27:13.326
the man you're sharing your
bed with is a terrorist?

27:13.327 --> 27:15.114
You're a part of this!

27:15.115 --> 27:19.731
I have nothing to hide.
Yes, you do, and I'm gonna find it.

27:19.732 --> 27:22.050
And when I do, I'm gonna lock
you up as a material witness

27:22.051 --> 27:25.088
and send that baby off to foster care.
No, you can't do that.

27:25.089 --> 27:27.322
Oh, yes, I can. Watch me.
Sir, can I talk to you?

27:27.323 --> 27:30.949
No. Go ahead.
Kiss your daughter good-bye. Please.

27:30.950 --> 27:33.154
Social Services is right outside that door.

27:33.155 --> 27:34.940
Please. Please. Why are you doing this?

27:34.941 --> 27:36.211
Nazihah, Nazihah, that
means "honesty," right?

27:36.212 --> 27:37.707
Why are you doing this?
Please. I swear to you,

27:37.708 --> 27:38.064
I don't know. 
"Honesty," is that what it means in Arabic?

27:38.065 --> 27:40.552
I'm gonna give you one more
chance to be honest with me...

27:40.553 --> 27:42.168
Or I will take your baby away,

27:42.169 --> 27:44.687
and you will never see it again.
I swear!

27:44.688 --> 27:46.343
Do you understand? 
I swear to you,

27:46.344 --> 27:48.676
I don't know! I don't know anything!

27:48.677 --> 27:50.568
Please don't take her away from me.

27:50.569 --> 27:53.297
She's the only thing I have. Please.

27:53.298 --> 27:55.131
Please.

27:55.132 --> 27:56.106
All right.

27:58.666 --> 28:00.536
Nobody's gonna take your
baby away from you.

28:04.225 --> 28:04.932
Here.

28:06.210 --> 28:07.282
It's okay.

28:08.456 --> 28:10.787
You appreciate the tight
spot I'm in, I'm sure.

28:10.788 --> 28:13.158
I have to be sure you're telling the truth.

28:14.315 --> 28:15.840
Agent Geider will drive you home.

28:15.841 --> 28:16.757
You're free to go.

28:28.933 --> 28:30.230
Still think she's truthful?

28:31.250 --> 28:32.464
I just want your opinion.

28:33.267 --> 28:34.491
Truthful or no?

28:36.475 --> 28:37.630
Yes.

28:39.140 --> 28:40.452
But I still have to operate

28:40.453 --> 28:42.146
under the assumption that she's lying.

28:43.386 --> 28:46.083
While she was in here, I pulled a
national security certificate.

28:46.084 --> 28:48.274
Her house has just been bugged.

28:48.275 --> 28:50.862
She'll be under surveillance 24/7.

28:50.863 --> 28:53.747
If she's hiding something, we'll find it.

28:54.882 --> 28:56.538
It's important that she believes

28:56.539 --> 28:57.963
I think she's telling the truth.

29:00.723 --> 29:01.447
You did good.

29:02.572 --> 29:04.001
She considers you an ally.

29:04.002 --> 29:05.524
That could be helpful later.

29:06.429 --> 29:07.807
Thanks for playing, Beckett.

29:09.325 --> 29:11.138
That money that Amir received

29:11.139 --> 29:15.972
was wired through six banks,
but originated in...

29:15.973 --> 29:17.063
Afghanistan.

29:18.525 --> 29:21.035
Whoa. Got a visitor at C412

29:21.036 --> 29:22.312
six hours before you and Beckett got there.

29:26.345 --> 29:28.049
This is the break we've been looking for.

29:29.107 --> 29:30.593
That crate looks heavy.

29:30.594 --> 29:32.390
It's all the lead shielding.

29:36.407 --> 29:38.574
That's Amir's cousin Jamal.

29:42.292 --> 29:43.582
And he has the bomb.

29:48.169 --> 29:49.317
Jamal Alhabi...

29:50.857 --> 29:53.152
He had his cousin Amir fashion a dirty bomb

29:53.153 --> 29:54.099
and then he killed him.

29:54.100 --> 29:57.005
He's most likely the leader
of our terrorist cell.

29:57.989 --> 30:00.123
Now less than 12 hours
ago, he disappeared...

30:01.754 --> 30:02.838
Along with the bomb.

30:03.570 --> 30:04.734
Now at minimum,

30:05.153 --> 30:08.229
he'd need a van or an S.U.V. 
to transport it.

30:08.450 --> 30:11.412
Jamal owns a moving company,
so check his trucks.

30:11.413 --> 30:14.342
Pull traffic video, work his financials.

30:16.434 --> 30:17.681
Folks, we live here.

30:18.771 --> 30:21.218
Our families, our loved ones,

30:21.739 --> 30:22.893
our neighbors...

30:23.121 --> 30:25.078
I don't have to tell you what's at stake.

30:28.235 --> 30:29.285
Let's find him.

30:33.277 --> 30:34.577
Can I talk to you a second?

30:34.735 --> 30:35.649
Yeah.

30:42.797 --> 30:44.049
What's your take on Fallon?

30:44.050 --> 30:47.271
Smart cop, driven, killer instinct.

30:47.803 --> 30:50.455
As a person... kind of a douche.

30:50.690 --> 30:52.063
Open-minded douche?

30:52.241 --> 30:53.494
No. Why?

30:55.426 --> 30:57.976
The key to any good story is authenticity.

30:58.086 --> 31:01.297
It's making it feel real for the reader.

31:01.298 --> 31:02.623
That's why writers work so hard

31:02.624 --> 31:04.292
making the details right.

31:06.288 --> 31:08.395
Jamal and Amir as terrorists?

31:08.545 --> 31:10.447
The details are not right.

31:10.448 --> 31:11.695
Yeah, but the evidence is.

31:11.696 --> 31:14.926
Castle, we've got Jamal on video
wheeling off a dirty bomb.

31:14.927 --> 31:16.395
Why wasn't he nervous?

31:16.872 --> 31:19.738
Why wasn't he sweating bullets
every time he hit a bump?

31:20.736 --> 31:22.467
Jamal owned a moving company.

31:22.503 --> 31:24.022
What if he didn't know
what was in the crate?

31:24.023 --> 31:25.298
What if he was just hired to pick it up?

31:25.299 --> 31:26.921
What if he's just a cold-blooded killer?

31:26.922 --> 31:28.457
Well, nothing we've learned points to that

31:28.458 --> 31:30.433
with either of these men.
Okay,

31:30.434 --> 31:32.001
what about that money that Amir received,

31:32.002 --> 31:33.899
the money that you traced
back to Afghanistan?

31:33.900 --> 31:36.079
To a bank outside Bagram air base,

31:36.080 --> 31:38.564
often used by military personnel.

31:38.565 --> 31:41.545
Why would a terrorist pick
that bank to wire money?

31:41.546 --> 31:44.148
Castle, the keys that we used
to open that storage unit

31:44.149 --> 31:45.728
are from Amir's keychain.

31:46.492 --> 31:48.204
The killer could've put the key there.

31:48.205 --> 31:52.273
All these bread crumbs that
have led us to Amir and Jamal,

31:52.547 --> 31:56.036
what if they were left there for us to find?
Castle...

31:56.037 --> 31:58.969
Something else is going on here.

32:00.719 --> 32:02.538
Okay, fine. What would you like us to do?

32:02.704 --> 32:05.628
Talk to the one person who has
a different view of Amir.

32:06.202 --> 32:07.747
But I'm gonna need your help.

32:09.696 --> 32:10.805
All right. Listen up.

32:10.832 --> 32:12.775
Jamal bought these trucks
over two months ago.

32:12.776 --> 32:13.788
It's a perfect cover

32:13.789 --> 32:16.233
for moving material
without anyone noticing.

32:16.833 --> 32:18.427
Where's the list of his employees?

32:18.428 --> 32:20.590
Just came in.
Nine guys, all middle eastern.

32:20.591 --> 32:23.500
All right. They're all
probably part of the cell.

32:23.743 --> 32:25.192
Let's get their 20s and then move on 'em.

32:25.193 --> 32:26.629
Got a purchase on Jamal's credit card

32:26.630 --> 32:28.208
three weeks ago for a burner phone.

32:28.209 --> 32:30.821
Run it down, see if we can
pull up any recent activity.

32:31.529 --> 32:33.913
Jamal's moving trucks are
parked in a lot in Queens.

32:33.914 --> 32:36.522
They're all accounted for
except for one 5-ton,

32:36.523 --> 32:39.574
and the log says Jamal
checked it out 12 hours ago,

32:39.575 --> 32:42.448
never brought it back.
He must have used it to move the crate.

32:42.975 --> 32:45.544
Call in that alert. Let's find the truck.

32:47.861 --> 32:49.666
Hey, where's Castle?

32:50.185 --> 32:52.191
I don't know. Must have stepped out.

33:01.260 --> 33:02.793
Off the record or not,

33:03.836 --> 33:06.339
why should I talk to you about Amir Alhabi?

33:06.494 --> 33:09.013
Because the last thing
you want is my country

33:09.014 --> 33:11.673
thinking your country's
behind this activity.

33:12.655 --> 33:14.418
Nothing is further from the truth.

33:14.478 --> 33:16.411
Well, then maybe you can
help clear this up.

33:17.582 --> 33:20.452
Amir was in your nuclear program,

33:20.453 --> 33:21.802
so he was an asset.

33:22.335 --> 33:23.557
You have him watched?

33:23.742 --> 33:25.754
It's my business to stay informed.

33:25.806 --> 33:27.627
Did you ever see any evidence of terrorism?

33:29.367 --> 33:30.307
No.

33:30.936 --> 33:34.411
But then, what other
answer could I give you?

33:35.887 --> 33:37.243
Why were you at Amir's home?

33:37.840 --> 33:39.060
To chat with him.

33:40.942 --> 33:44.396
I am adept at violence,
but it wasn't called for.

33:44.889 --> 33:46.638
I met with Amir from time to time

33:46.639 --> 33:49.644
to remind him of his history.

33:50.599 --> 33:52.539
To convince him to come back...

33:52.871 --> 33:54.143
back to the weapons program.

33:54.144 --> 33:56.865
Amir did vital research for us, but he left

33:56.866 --> 33:59.464
because he had moral qualms about his work.

34:00.051 --> 34:02.279
Normally money can overcome such obstacles.

34:03.653 --> 34:05.095
Not so with Amir.

34:05.579 --> 34:07.319
What happened on that cab ride?

34:10.762 --> 34:12.063
Amir sought me out.

34:12.811 --> 34:14.101
He was quite angry.

34:14.228 --> 34:16.770
He believed I had placed
$10,000 in his account

34:16.771 --> 34:18.360
as a way of pressuring him.

34:18.554 --> 34:20.031
But he was mistaken. 
Wait a minute.

34:20.032 --> 34:22.521
You're saying Amir didn't know
where the money came from?

34:26.284 --> 34:28.402
It's nice speaking to you, Mr. Castle.

34:29.253 --> 34:30.251
As events unfold,

34:30.252 --> 34:33.391
you may find yourself in need
of a man with my skills.

34:37.348 --> 34:39.056
If such a moment arises...

34:48.828 --> 34:50.255
Do you realize what this means?

34:50.257 --> 34:52.023
If Amir didn't know about the money,

34:52.024 --> 34:54.438
then he couldn't have been
paid to build that bomb.

34:56.659 --> 34:58.597
Can I speak with the two of you, please?

35:11.850 --> 35:13.695
Now I like to cover my bases.

35:14.650 --> 35:17.499
So you can imagine my surprise
when I find out one of our own

35:17.500 --> 35:19.149
is having a nonfat latte

35:19.150 --> 35:21.441
with a suspect in this investigation.

35:22.786 --> 35:25.008
I have agents on Fariq Yusef.

35:25.131 --> 35:28.018
If you just allow me to explain...
I don't even know what you're doing here.

35:28.190 --> 35:30.266
You go and talk to a foreign official?

35:30.508 --> 35:31.605
What if the Syrians are behind this?

35:31.606 --> 35:32.706
Do you have any idea what you've done?

35:32.707 --> 35:34.537
Jamal and Amir are not terrorists.

35:34.538 --> 35:35.609
You're chasing the wrong guys...

35:35.610 --> 35:37.639
Do you have any idea
how many laws you've broken?

35:37.640 --> 35:38.702
I ought to have you arrested.

35:38.703 --> 35:39.955
Sir, I think what Castle
is trying to say...

35:39.956 --> 35:43.791
Detective Beckett, did you know about this?
Yes, I did.

35:46.132 --> 35:47.408
Well, that's disappointing.

35:50.470 --> 35:52.323
In the interest of national
security, I'm gonna

35:52.324 --> 35:54.328
have to have the both of you
removed from this task force.

35:54.329 --> 35:55.728
Do you understand?
Sir.

35:57.785 --> 35:59.357
Beckett's the best I have.

35:59.498 --> 36:00.699
Now Castle can be a pain in the ass,

36:00.700 --> 36:02.455
but he thinks outside the box.

36:03.156 --> 36:05.385
It's not your party anymore, captain.

36:11.613 --> 36:13.777
I'll have my agents escort you out.

36:15.853 --> 36:17.007
Oh, and, Castle?

36:19.727 --> 36:20.721
The governor?

36:22.057 --> 36:23.383
He's never heard of you.

36:36.289 --> 36:37.655
Where are Alexis and Martha?

36:37.656 --> 36:39.126
I sent them out of town.

36:39.889 --> 36:40.834
Do they know why?

36:40.835 --> 36:42.421
No. You get ahold of Josh?

36:42.753 --> 36:43.737
Couldn't get through to his cell.

36:43.738 --> 36:45.646
He's probably already on the plane.

36:49.586 --> 36:52.528
A 600-thread-count shower
curtain murder board.

36:52.529 --> 36:54.897
I snapped a photo of it as
we were being thrown out.

36:54.898 --> 36:55.846
And...

36:56.554 --> 37:00.697
Here... I have Amir's driving data.

37:00.698 --> 37:03.200
It's like our own mini precinct.
Except it smells better.

37:03.201 --> 37:04.104
Thank you.

37:04.105 --> 37:06.973
Castle, even if Amir is
innocent, Jamal isn't.

37:07.201 --> 37:10.601
His guilt is predicated on
Amir being a terrorist.

37:10.602 --> 37:13.294
Without that, Jamal's just
another guy moving a crate.

37:13.426 --> 37:15.369
No, this all comes back to Amir.

37:15.370 --> 37:18.239
What we need to do is solve his murder.

37:18.755 --> 37:21.073
This is a photo off the
moving company's web site.

37:21.074 --> 37:23.178
This is the exact truck we're looking for.

37:23.179 --> 37:24.408
All right, send it downtown.

37:24.409 --> 37:26.950
Get it circulated to every officer on duty.
All right.

37:26.951 --> 37:29.417
Sir, you better have a look at this.
What do you got?

37:29.854 --> 37:31.789
Tech just got me locked on
to Jamal's burner phone.

37:31.790 --> 37:34.490
Looks like he just sent a
text to another burner.

37:36.302 --> 37:38.214
How many choppers you have in your fleet?
Seven.

37:38.215 --> 37:40.214
All right. This truck could be parked

37:40.215 --> 37:42.778
with the bomb set to go off,
just like Oklahoma City.

37:43.213 --> 37:45.139
Coordinate a street-by-street grid search.

37:45.253 --> 37:46.419
Okay, how about this?

37:47.021 --> 37:49.532
Amir overhears a terrorist plot.

37:49.533 --> 37:51.597
He installs cameras to gather evidence,

37:51.598 --> 37:53.237
only they found out and they killed him.

37:53.238 --> 37:54.954
That means that a passenger was involved,

37:54.955 --> 37:56.683
a regular passenger. 
Right,

37:56.684 --> 37:58.075
and they mentioned the storage facility,

37:58.076 --> 38:00.813
which is where he got the C4121652.

38:00.814 --> 38:03.007
But why would a passenger
talk about the storage unit

38:03.008 --> 38:05.974
in front of Amir, especially
if they were gonna frame him?

38:05.975 --> 38:09.834
Maybe... we're going about this all wrong.

38:10.455 --> 38:10.984
You are right.

38:10.985 --> 38:15.787
A-a passenger wouldn't openly
discuss a-a-a terrorist plot,

38:15.788 --> 38:17.398
but a driver might...

38:17.499 --> 38:19.392
In the car to a collaborator,

38:19.393 --> 38:20.751
alone, on the phone.

38:20.752 --> 38:23.885
What if Amir suspected another driver?

38:24.121 --> 38:25.494
Okay, here is...

38:25.665 --> 38:26.727
Kevin McCann's last shift.

38:26.728 --> 38:29.733
This is a day before the
murder, and look at that.

38:29.863 --> 38:31.134
He stopped near the storage facility

38:31.135 --> 38:33.894
where they kept the cobalt-60.
He's a cab driver, Castle.

38:33.895 --> 38:35.329
He was probably dropping off a fare.

38:35.330 --> 38:37.180
Besides, he alibied out.

38:37.768 --> 38:39.375
There he is near the warehouse, too.

38:39.376 --> 38:41.883
That's 100 yards from where
we found Amir's body.

38:42.286 --> 38:43.704
So the last two places Amir was,

38:43.705 --> 38:45.480
and Kevin McCann has been to both of them?

38:45.481 --> 38:47.264
There's no way that that's a coincidence.

38:47.265 --> 38:49.160
We at least have to go see
why this warehouse area

38:49.161 --> 38:50.446
is so popular.

38:54.715 --> 38:55.807
Montgomery.

38:57.426 --> 38:59.083
Okay. Got it.

38:59.606 --> 39:01.161
We got a location on the truck.

39:22.038 --> 39:24.247
One of my guys on the
grid search spotted it.

39:24.284 --> 39:26.370
Did the radiation detector go off? 
You bet.

39:26.371 --> 39:27.650
How long has it been sitting here?

39:27.651 --> 39:29.529
Not long. The hood's still warm.

39:29.530 --> 39:30.630
Open her up!

39:34.362 --> 39:36.521
Damn it! Check all the buildings.

39:36.522 --> 39:39.118
Sweep every inch in a 4-block radius.

39:54.500 --> 39:55.624
Looks empty.

39:56.322 --> 39:58.510
This is where Kevin McCann parked.

41:12.055 --> 41:14.659
Castle, door. 
We gotta move.

41:15.326 --> 41:17.571
Ready? 
Go.

41:47.408 --> 41:48.428
Beckett.

41:56.394 --> 41:57.434
It's Jamal.
