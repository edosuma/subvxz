00:29.170 --> 00:31.237
â™ª Beast Wars

00:31.337 --> 00:33.838
NARRATOR: Last time, on Beast Wars:

00:33.938 --> 00:35.338
Destroy them.

00:35.438 --> 00:37.872
RHINOX: We're going down.

00:37.972 --> 00:40.072
OPTIMUS: Our robot forms will start to short out

00:40.172 --> 00:42.172
after a few minutes' exposure.

00:42.272 --> 00:43.940
These beast forms are to protect us

00:44.040 --> 00:46.873
from the long-term effects of the energon fields out there.

00:46.973 --> 00:49.774
MEGATRON: Only the Maximals could give us trouble now.

00:49.874 --> 00:51.041
Find them.

00:53.308 --> 00:54.975
Back to the base. Let's go!

00:55.075 --> 00:58.542
I have left the Predacons to join your group,

00:58.642 --> 01:02.076
as leader.

01:04.876 --> 01:06.944
( tense theme playing )

01:17.579 --> 01:21.146
( growling ): Face me, Optimus.

01:21.246 --> 01:25.613
I, Dinobot, challenge you for leadership of the Maximals.

01:25.713 --> 01:29.080
You and I, one-on-one.

01:29.180 --> 01:32.647
The winner shall be leader and, for the loser,

01:32.748 --> 01:38.282
well, it is a long way down.

01:38.382 --> 01:40.683
I don't want to fight you.

01:40.782 --> 01:43.282
You do not have a choice.

01:43.383 --> 01:46.017
Your command center is back there,

01:46.117 --> 01:51.550
and no one crosses this bridge until you face me.

01:54.885 --> 01:57.718
Don't we get a say in this?

01:57.818 --> 02:00.986
Let chopper face and the boss monkey duke it.

02:01.086 --> 02:02.686
No fur off of my tail.

02:02.786 --> 02:04.986
No way. Hey, scale belly!

02:05.086 --> 02:07.887
How's about you try a piece of the bad kitty, huh?

02:07.987 --> 02:09.620
Cool your circuits, Cheetor.

02:09.720 --> 02:10.954
I wouldn't send anyone

02:11.054 --> 02:14.188
to do anything I wasn't willing to do myself.

02:14.288 --> 02:16.589
Oh, yeah, right. Now he says that.

02:16.688 --> 02:18.889
Agh! This is foolish, Dinobot.

02:18.989 --> 02:21.555
We're Maximals. You are a Predacon.

02:21.655 --> 02:24.957
All the more reason I should lead, then.

02:25.057 --> 02:26.356
Look,

02:26.456 --> 02:28.190
I don't know what happened between you and Megatron--

02:28.290 --> 02:30.958
Megatron! Megatron will fall

02:31.058 --> 02:34.458
as soon as I have your Maximals at my command.

02:34.558 --> 02:39.192
You are welcome to join us, but you shall not lead.

02:39.292 --> 02:41.925
I beg to differ.

02:42.025 --> 02:46.293
For, in anticipation of my new role as leader,

02:46.394 --> 02:49.861
I have already reprogrammed my activation code.

02:49.961 --> 02:54.428
Dinobot, maximize!

02:54.528 --> 02:56.195
( roars )

02:59.229 --> 03:02.863
Optimus Primal, maximize!

03:02.963 --> 03:04.696
( roars )

03:04.796 --> 03:07.230
( dramatic theme playing )

03:20.766 --> 03:23.666
I'm going in there! Cheetor, maxi--

03:23.767 --> 03:25.099
Clamp it, kitty.

03:25.199 --> 03:28.434
Nailing the chopper from behind won't settle anything.

03:28.534 --> 03:32.968
Yeah. Like it or not, we gotta let 'em finish.

03:33.068 --> 03:35.435
( dramatic rock theme playing )

03:35.535 --> 03:38.535
( Dinobot grunts )

03:39.802 --> 03:41.469
( growling )

03:49.203 --> 03:51.037
( grunts )

04:04.440 --> 04:06.740
( circuits buzzing )

04:15.574 --> 04:18.742
Ah. I still live.

04:18.842 --> 04:20.475
Finish it.

04:22.410 --> 04:25.209
That's not how we Maximals do things.

04:25.309 --> 04:30.878
Then that will have to change.

04:31.544 --> 04:33.145
( yells )

04:33.245 --> 04:36.178
( dramatic rock theme playing )

04:57.882 --> 04:59.649
( groans )

04:59.749 --> 05:02.249
What are you doing? You'd won.

05:02.349 --> 05:04.983
You slipped.

05:05.083 --> 05:08.650
To defeat you in such a manner would be lacking in honor.

05:08.750 --> 05:12.818
I would not have earned the right to lead.

05:12.918 --> 05:17.285
I prefer to beat my opponents the old-fashioned way.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.519
Brutally!

05:20.619 --> 05:23.986
( dramatic rock theme playing )

05:28.553 --> 05:33.255
For a Predacon, Dinobot, you have qualities I could like.

05:33.354 --> 05:37.955
And you, unh, have proved to be a worthy adversary.

05:38.055 --> 05:42.790
I will have you recycled with full honors.

05:42.890 --> 05:46.424
Well, that's just prime.

05:46.523 --> 05:50.424
Well, this is an interesting sight.

05:50.524 --> 05:55.725
Yes. Optimus and the traitor Dinobot engaged in battle.

05:55.825 --> 05:57.825
Who do you think's gonna win?

05:57.925 --> 06:01.559
Ooh, Waspinator bet on Optimus.

06:01.659 --> 06:03.026
( chuckles )

06:03.126 --> 06:05.726
The winner isn't what interests me...

06:05.826 --> 06:08.326
Nor me. No.

06:08.427 --> 06:11.327
How much more preferable it would be

06:11.428 --> 06:14.995
if they both lost? Yes.

06:15.095 --> 06:18.095
Megatron, terrorize!

06:18.195 --> 06:21.196
( roars )

06:21.295 --> 06:23.663
Terrorsaur, terrorize!

06:23.762 --> 06:26.530
( screeches )

06:26.630 --> 06:28.630
Tarantulas, terrorize!

06:28.730 --> 06:31.364
( laughing )

06:31.464 --> 06:36.365
Waspinator, terrorize!

06:36.465 --> 06:37.965
( buzzing )

06:38.065 --> 06:40.799
Scorponok, terrorize!

06:40.899 --> 06:43.232
( roars )

06:43.332 --> 06:47.666
Yo! Shift your scanners due east there, pals.

06:47.766 --> 06:50.600
This party has got bigtime crashers.

06:50.700 --> 06:53.301
Fire.

06:57.468 --> 06:59.935
( dramatic theme playing )

07:03.003 --> 07:04.502
Optimus!

07:04.602 --> 07:08.004
Beast mode!

07:08.103 --> 07:09.904
( roars )

07:12.004 --> 07:14.638
Optimus!

07:21.439 --> 07:24.239
If you guys aren't doing anything...

07:28.140 --> 07:30.574
...a little speed would be prime.

07:32.674 --> 07:34.974
Make them fall. Yes.

07:35.074 --> 07:37.975
Let's go. Cheetor, maximize!

07:38.074 --> 07:39.909
( snarling )

07:40.009 --> 07:43.142
Rhinox, maximize!

07:43.242 --> 07:46.609
( roars )

07:46.709 --> 07:51.510
Hey, you go and get yourselves scrapped, because I ain't--

07:51.610 --> 07:52.911
Oh! Aah!

07:53.011 --> 07:54.578
All right. All right.

07:54.678 --> 07:59.446
( groaning ): The energon fields.

07:59.546 --> 08:01.979
I am shorting out.

08:02.079 --> 08:06.146
Unh! Hang on! You can't transform in this position.

08:06.246 --> 08:11.914
Release me. Let me fall. And save yourself.

08:12.014 --> 08:16.148
Unh! Now where's the honor in that?

08:16.248 --> 08:18.482
( grunting )

08:21.016 --> 08:24.349
You have no choice.

08:24.450 --> 08:28.317
Then we both go. Aah!

08:28.416 --> 08:29.716
( grunts )

08:29.817 --> 08:30.917
RHINOX: Going up?

08:31.017 --> 08:33.751
( groans )

08:33.851 --> 08:36.752
This is our opportunity. Yes.

08:36.851 --> 08:38.418
All weapons.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.486
( dramatic rock theme playing )

09:03.589 --> 09:04.589
( grunts )

09:13.224 --> 09:15.624
Oh, phew!

09:15.724 --> 09:17.225
You're welcome.

09:17.325 --> 09:20.325
You're the leader. It's your, uh, job.

09:22.625 --> 09:24.626
( roars )

09:24.726 --> 09:27.693
Incompetence. You let them escape.

09:27.793 --> 09:32.461
Megatron, look up there. The missiles!

09:38.428 --> 09:39.728
MEGATRON: Energon.

09:39.829 --> 09:44.563
Yes. Raw, natural energon crystal.

09:44.663 --> 09:46.729
I knew it was here.

09:46.830 --> 09:50.831
( circuits buzzing )

09:50.931 --> 09:55.698
Unh! Quickly, return to beast mode.

09:58.199 --> 10:01.265
( mysterious theme playing )

10:01.365 --> 10:03.666
Raw energon.

10:03.766 --> 10:06.166
In its natural form, it's highly unstable.

10:06.266 --> 10:09.400
We're lucky those missiles didn't cause it to explode.

10:09.500 --> 10:12.101
If you can call it lucky.

10:12.201 --> 10:14.468
Megatron's on the move.

10:17.435 --> 10:20.268
Bearing six-one-seven-five.

10:20.368 --> 10:23.369
He's after the energon.

10:23.470 --> 10:29.003
A crystal that size would make him unstoppable.

10:29.103 --> 10:33.304
Oh, well, thanks a lot for the hot tip, scale belly.

10:33.404 --> 10:35.371
Rhinox, scrap this gang.

10:37.904 --> 10:39.939
Hold on, Rhinox.

10:40.039 --> 10:42.239
Will he send fliers?

10:42.339 --> 10:44.973
Oh, for booting up cold,

10:45.072 --> 10:48.240
you're not gonna believe a Predacon, are you?

10:48.340 --> 10:50.974
That's my call.

10:51.073 --> 10:52.241
Will he?

10:52.340 --> 10:54.575
Hm. Negative.

10:54.674 --> 10:58.142
The crystal is too big for the fliers to carry.

10:58.242 --> 11:01.742
Only Tarantulas has the skill to segment it.

11:01.843 --> 11:04.076
Then we have to get there first.

11:04.176 --> 11:05.709
All five of us.

11:05.809 --> 11:08.577
Yeah, heh-heh, all five of us.

11:08.677 --> 11:12.177
You mean, chopper face is going with?

11:12.277 --> 11:15.177
We're all gonna die.

11:15.277 --> 11:17.478
Hey! Wait for me!

11:17.578 --> 11:19.579
( dramatic rock theme playing )

11:24.979 --> 11:27.713
So much energon.

11:27.813 --> 11:29.414
With a crystal that size,

11:29.513 --> 11:32.514
the Predacon forces will be unstoppable.

11:32.614 --> 11:35.215
Yes. The Maximals,

11:35.315 --> 11:39.482
and then the galaxy, will be ours to conquer.

11:39.582 --> 11:41.915
( dramatic rock theme playing )

11:45.049 --> 11:47.283
( suspenseful theme playing )

11:52.684 --> 11:54.551
How're you feeling?

11:54.650 --> 11:55.851
Improved.

11:55.951 --> 11:58.785
I believe my internal repairs have been completed.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.752
Hm. I was wondering.

12:01.852 --> 12:04.552
Your flying robot form could make it to the crystal

12:04.652 --> 12:05.953
before any of us.

12:06.053 --> 12:08.753
No. We have to stay together.

12:08.854 --> 12:10.820
The Predacons could attack at any moment.

12:10.920 --> 12:14.087
And there may be other surprises on this planet.

12:14.187 --> 12:18.788
There are. Down there. Look.

12:20.455 --> 12:22.856
( suspenseful theme playing )

12:25.056 --> 12:29.790
Hm. Unusual. Any opinions?

12:29.890 --> 12:33.057
Just one. It isn't natural.

12:33.157 --> 12:37.658
We didn't build it and neither did the Predacons.

12:37.758 --> 12:38.758
( Cheetor growling )

12:38.859 --> 12:40.325
Heads up!

12:42.226 --> 12:43.226
( buzzing )

12:48.260 --> 12:53.494
Waspinator, terrorize!

12:53.594 --> 12:55.695
Terrorsaur, terrorize!

12:55.794 --> 12:57.361
( screeches )

12:59.528 --> 13:01.529
( roars )

13:03.262 --> 13:04.796
( roars )

13:08.497 --> 13:09.964
Defensive positions.

13:10.064 --> 13:11.563
Yeah, what about him?

13:11.663 --> 13:13.364
He's with us.

13:13.464 --> 13:17.265
Yeah, yeah, I ain't buying it just because you say so.

13:19.465 --> 13:22.265
( dramatic rock theme playing )

13:31.833 --> 13:34.701
Hold your fire. We could start an avalanche.

13:34.801 --> 13:38.101
You crossed your wires? They're coming back.

13:38.201 --> 13:40.201
( dramatic rock theme plays )

13:43.236 --> 13:44.703
I'll handle this.

13:46.302 --> 13:47.836
( beeps )

13:51.070 --> 13:53.837
( screeching )

14:00.072 --> 14:01.138
( both yell )

14:11.140 --> 14:14.708
Now! When they are weak.

14:21.008 --> 14:23.475
( dramatic theme playing )

14:23.575 --> 14:25.076
( grunting )

14:28.076 --> 14:32.611
I knew it, you traitor. You tried to scrap my pal.

14:32.711 --> 14:33.777
( growls )

14:37.612 --> 14:41.612
Once a Pred, always a Pred.

14:41.712 --> 14:43.712
Ease off, Rattrap.

14:43.812 --> 14:45.179
It was an accident.

14:45.279 --> 14:46.646
Says you.

14:46.746 --> 14:48.579
That's right. Says me.

14:48.679 --> 14:52.014
You wanna question my orders one more time?

14:52.113 --> 14:53.413
I--

14:53.514 --> 14:55.181
( sighs )

14:55.281 --> 14:58.214
Yeah, I don't trust Predacons.

15:04.415 --> 15:06.983
We've got enough trouble with Megatron's crew

15:07.083 --> 15:09.083
without fighting amongst ourselves.

15:09.183 --> 15:10.917
Now come on!

15:18.784 --> 15:21.652
So much energon.

15:21.752 --> 15:25.819
Yes. I can almost taste its power.

15:25.919 --> 15:29.486
The energon fields would destroy us as robots

15:29.586 --> 15:31.087
in less than a minute.

15:31.187 --> 15:33.754
We will have to stay in beast form.

15:33.854 --> 15:37.388
And Optimus and the Maximals are coming.

15:37.488 --> 15:39.755
They must stay in beast form as well.

15:39.855 --> 15:43.788
And I will handle Optimus personally.

15:43.889 --> 15:45.890
( suspenseful theme playing )

15:47.623 --> 15:49.923
( energon crystals chiming )

15:56.691 --> 15:59.324
( roars )

16:10.093 --> 16:14.528
Across the galaxy, it has come to this, Optimus Primal.

16:14.628 --> 16:18.661
Face to face, tooth to claw. Yes.

16:18.761 --> 16:21.262
Have you anything to say?

16:21.362 --> 16:25.396
I'd say that's prime. Let's do it!

16:25.496 --> 16:26.463
( roars )

16:26.563 --> 16:29.897
( dramatic rock theme playing )

16:43.832 --> 16:44.999
( Megatron growls )

16:45.099 --> 16:46.699
( roaring )

16:46.799 --> 16:47.699
( grunts )

16:47.799 --> 16:49.166
( groans )

16:50.267 --> 16:51.600
( snarling )

16:54.001 --> 16:55.567
( growling )

16:56.834 --> 16:57.868
( yelling )

16:59.368 --> 17:00.801
( growling )

17:00.902 --> 17:01.902
( grunts )

17:06.569 --> 17:08.503
( grunts )

17:08.603 --> 17:12.370
( roars )

17:12.470 --> 17:16.905
Admit defeat, Maximal. The energon shall be ours.

17:17.005 --> 17:20.005
Not if I can help it.

17:20.105 --> 17:21.772
( grunting )

17:27.006 --> 17:29.873
Surrender, Megatron. You're trapped.

17:29.973 --> 17:33.140
No! You shall not defeat me.

17:33.240 --> 17:35.674
( growling )

17:40.842 --> 17:41.975
( grunts )

17:44.342 --> 17:45.442
( grunts )

17:46.910 --> 17:49.210
( screams )

17:49.310 --> 17:50.610
( roaring )

17:50.709 --> 17:52.677
( groans )

17:55.444 --> 17:57.645
( Megatron yelling )

18:05.779 --> 18:07.346
( groans )

18:11.547 --> 18:14.147
It is over, Megatron!

18:14.247 --> 18:18.748
It is never over. No.

18:20.115 --> 18:26.182
For if I must die, I shall take you with me.

18:26.283 --> 18:29.750
( suspenseful theme playing )

18:41.385 --> 18:42.718
( energon crystals chiming)

18:42.818 --> 18:45.719
( mountain rumbling )

18:45.819 --> 18:48.886
It's gonna blow.

18:51.920 --> 18:53.854
Time to fade, heroes.

18:53.954 --> 18:55.987
( suspenseful theme playing )

19:17.925 --> 19:19.491
( chiming intensifies )

19:22.325 --> 19:26.426
( yells )

19:44.362 --> 19:45.396
Thanks.

19:45.496 --> 19:50.030
My action did not imply loyalty, Optimus.

19:50.130 --> 19:54.931
I owed you my life. Now we are merely even.

19:55.031 --> 19:57.331
I'll accept that.

19:57.431 --> 20:00.032
Yeah, well, uh, at least Megatron's gone,

20:00.132 --> 20:01.431
and so is the energon.

20:01.531 --> 20:03.465
So it's over.

20:03.566 --> 20:05.199
Can we go home now?

20:05.299 --> 20:06.699
No, Rattrap.

20:06.799 --> 20:09.366
For now we're stranded here with the Predacons

20:09.466 --> 20:11.567
on this unknown planet.

20:11.667 --> 20:15.601
Megatron may be back, and there is still more energon.

20:15.701 --> 20:19.235
If they ever get enough, they could conquer the galaxy.

20:19.335 --> 20:23.835
So for now, let the battle be here,

20:23.936 --> 20:26.136
on this strange, primitive world.

20:26.236 --> 20:29.503
And let it be called Beast Wars!

20:29.603 --> 20:31.670
( dramatic rock theme playing )

20:42.505 --> 20:44.705
â™ª Beast Wars

20:44.805 --> 20:48.406
( dramatic rock theme playing )
