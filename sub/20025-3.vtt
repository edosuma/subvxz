WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:08.308 --> 00:11.144
'If you're easily offended,
please turn over now.'

00:12.746 --> 00:17.183
Six years ago, the Geordie squad
first got together.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.622
But it's not all been one big party.

00:22.689 --> 00:26.393
Back to work.
Gotta work for that wrinkly Anna?

00:28.628 --> 00:31.698
We fucking nailed it.

00:31.765 --> 00:34.234
# Any cock's good
But it's cock, cock, cock #

00:36.202 --> 00:40.306
We've only gone and made
her business a global success.

00:40.373 --> 00:43.576
So, now, the squad is expanding.

00:43.643 --> 00:46.045
Oi, oi!
Hello!

00:46.112 --> 00:47.947
Hiya!
(they cheer)

00:54.354 --> 00:57.490
I'm not gonna be able
to keep yous all on full time.

00:57.557 --> 01:00.827
We need to help Anna
decide who stays...

01:02.328 --> 01:03.930
...and who goes.

01:05.197 --> 01:07.500
The only thing
we give a shit about is...

01:07.567 --> 01:10.236
...are they fucking radge enough...

01:10.303 --> 01:13.039
...to join this crazy family?

01:19.078 --> 01:21.347
Let wuh fucking gan.

01:21.414 --> 01:24.017
So far, Anna's sent in
five new workers,

01:24.083 --> 01:27.120
Billy, Abbie, Sarah, Zahida and Eve.

01:27.187 --> 01:30.223
Whatever's she's up to
has had a massive impact.

01:30.290 --> 01:33.526
I need to send you home
to think about how you treat people.

01:33.593 --> 01:36.629
Losing my job over a fight,
it's disgusting.

01:36.696 --> 01:38.998
How many more?
As many as it takes.

01:39.065 --> 01:41.367
And Anna says
there's more on the way.

01:41.434 --> 01:44.103
Some of them won't make the cut.

01:44.170 --> 01:46.873
This is in your hands.
We have the power!

01:48.174 --> 01:50.810
We wanna know how fun
they will be to live with.

01:55.615 --> 01:58.751
Martin's saying really nice things.
That's a surprise.

01:59.919 --> 02:02.388
I told them all
that none of them were safe.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.657
Your fate is in our hands.

02:04.724 --> 02:07.093
I can't believe
some of us could go home.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.794
(they cheer)

02:10.864 --> 02:12.799
I should have a degree in pulling.

02:12.866 --> 02:15.168
Never kiss anyone with no six-pack.

02:15.235 --> 02:17.904
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.340
Get me in.
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:20.406 --> 02:22.742
I'm preened to perfection.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.144
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:25.211 --> 02:27.981
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

02:28.047 --> 02:30.917
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:30.984 --> 02:34.587
My quiff's pure lethal
and me banter's pure naughty.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.656
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:54.073 --> 02:57.277
I don't think they were expecting,
like, me to tell them,

02:57.343 --> 02:59.946
basically, their fate's in our hands.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.948
They were shocked.
They were.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.850
Last night, I told the newbies

03:03.917 --> 03:06.986
that those that aren't up to scratch
won't make the cut.

03:07.053 --> 03:11.024
To be part of this, you need to do
everything that we do, but better.

03:11.090 --> 03:14.694
I didn't speak a single word
to Billy last night.

03:14.761 --> 03:17.330
I don't think
he spoke a single word.

03:17.397 --> 03:21.167
If Chloe was here last night, Billy
would've tried to get with Chloe.

03:21.234 --> 03:24.170
We all know that Anna's
gonna send in more new workers.

03:24.237 --> 03:27.607
We all miss Chloe so much and
it's strange not having her here.

03:27.674 --> 03:30.310
Billy's a lightweight.
What are we gonna do?

03:32.478 --> 03:33.713
(chuckles)

03:37.250 --> 03:40.219
Yo, Aaron,
did you pull anyone last night?

03:40.286 --> 03:41.854
I was in a bad way.

03:41.921 --> 03:43.823
(chuckles) Can you not remember?

03:43.890 --> 03:45.692
I was just pissed.

03:45.758 --> 03:48.227
Last night was fucking amazing.

03:48.294 --> 03:49.562
Everyone was smashed.

03:49.629 --> 03:51.130
We all had a wicked night.

03:51.197 --> 03:54.601
How you feeling, Billy?
Rough. Absolutely dire.

03:54.667 --> 03:58.605
I think, your first night and you're
sick, that means you went for it.

03:58.671 --> 04:02.008
Last night was Billy's first night,
and he got far too pissed.

04:02.075 --> 04:05.011
I've been there. I'll give him
the benefit of the doubt.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.347
Billy. Coffees.
(laughs)

04:18.757 --> 04:21.226
I'm back and I've learnt my lesson.

04:21.293 --> 04:22.695
I'm gonna try my hardest

04:22.762 --> 04:26.032
to make sure that Kick-off Chloe
does not come back.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.569
I've managed to peel meself
out of bed,

04:29.636 --> 04:33.106
and already I can hear the door
going. Who the hell could this be?

04:35.642 --> 04:38.011
(they cheer)

04:38.077 --> 04:39.078
It's Chloe!

04:39.145 --> 04:40.179
Hello!

04:40.246 --> 04:43.416
I'm so pleased
to see that girl's face.

04:43.483 --> 04:45.118
God, I have missed her so much.

04:46.185 --> 04:47.787
Hi, Martin.
How's life?

04:47.854 --> 04:49.689
It's awkward with Chloe back,

04:49.756 --> 04:52.492
cos I said I wasn't
gonna get with anyone.

04:52.558 --> 04:55.828
Since she's been gone,
I've necked on with Sarah.

04:55.895 --> 04:59.065
Anna's asked us to come back,
so no more drama for me.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.933
I've learned my lesson, Zahida.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.604
Chloe saying sorry straight away,
it's actually quite nice.

05:04.671 --> 05:08.241
I feel like I can bond with her, and
actually, I might quite like her.

05:08.307 --> 05:10.043
I'm really sorry for what I did.

05:10.109 --> 05:13.279
I feel so bad about the fight
between me and Zahida.

05:13.346 --> 05:17.283
It's no way to treat someone who
could be part of the Geordie family.

05:17.350 --> 05:18.785
Right... You just farted!

05:18.851 --> 05:21.020
I'm not well.
Oh, fuck's sake!

05:21.087 --> 05:23.256
Oh, my God! That fucking stinks!

05:23.322 --> 05:25.725
My time away has made me realise

05:25.792 --> 05:28.695
that Marty is the one
who makes me behave like this.

05:28.761 --> 05:31.264
So I need to stay away from that boy.

05:36.035 --> 05:38.805
(they laugh)

05:42.608 --> 05:46.379
It's important to us that we choose
the best for this family.

05:46.446 --> 05:47.880
It smells nice in here.

05:47.947 --> 05:52.385
So I've got an initiation that will
see how radge they really are.

05:52.452 --> 05:55.388
This will sort out the mint
from the shite.

05:55.455 --> 05:58.524
So, as yous know,
cos you're here to work,

05:58.591 --> 06:02.361
but we also wanna know
who of yous in the house is fun.

06:02.428 --> 06:04.864
So I wanna go get my nose pierced,
right?

06:04.931 --> 06:07.366
Which of you is radge enough
to get a piercing?

06:07.433 --> 06:09.502
(they shout excitedly)

06:09.569 --> 06:12.138
We're all going
to get piercings today,

06:12.205 --> 06:15.341
which should be a breeze.
I already look like a pin cushion.

06:15.408 --> 06:17.443
What will you get pierced?
Clit.

06:17.510 --> 06:20.613
Will you actually?
Cos that's fucking radge, that.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.082
Shit. I only said that for a laugh.

06:23.149 --> 06:25.585
(all) Get the clit done!
Get the clit done!

06:33.493 --> 06:35.728
(growls, laughs)

06:35.795 --> 06:39.732
Thanks for holding the door open
for us, you cock.

06:39.799 --> 06:42.201
Whoever impresses me
gets brownie points.

06:42.268 --> 06:44.771
I know Nathan
like the back of my hand,

06:44.837 --> 06:47.006
and he is on a mission.
Good luck, girls.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.378
I'm excited. You should be excited.

06:52.445 --> 06:53.546
I'm buzzing.
I am.

06:59.986 --> 07:02.455
Me and the girls
have arrived at the parlour.

07:02.522 --> 07:05.158
As this was my idea, I'll go first.

07:05.224 --> 07:06.425
Lead by example.

07:07.727 --> 07:10.863
Ready for this?
No. (groans)

07:12.231 --> 07:14.200
Oh, fuck.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.469
I want this job so bad,

07:16.536 --> 07:20.973
but there is no fucking way
I'm getting my clit pierced.

07:21.040 --> 07:24.577
Who's next? It's time for these
to prove to me who's the radgie.

07:24.644 --> 07:26.879
What's that? Are you doing it now?
Yeah.

07:26.946 --> 07:29.682
Since when is your clit on your ear,
Abbie?

07:29.749 --> 07:31.317
Do not move cos it's going in.

07:32.552 --> 07:34.987
Aah! You fucker! Is it in?

07:35.054 --> 07:36.789
Aah! I deserve an award.

07:36.856 --> 07:39.458
No, you don't. Next!

07:39.525 --> 07:44.197
Oh, my God. I thought this was gonna
be a piece of piss. It's killing us.

07:44.263 --> 07:46.132
Well done. I'm very proud of you.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.467
Next. Sarah.

07:48.534 --> 07:49.936
Ready for this?
Yeah.

07:51.404 --> 07:54.173
There we go. How was that one?
Didn't feel a thing.

07:54.240 --> 07:57.376
She got in that chair so fast,
I didn't even see her sit down.

07:57.443 --> 08:00.146
All right.
Smashed it.

08:00.213 --> 08:02.215
I was gonna get my ear pierced,

08:02.281 --> 08:05.384
but after seeing this lot,
I have got to out-radge them.

08:05.451 --> 08:06.886
(moans, screams)

08:06.953 --> 08:10.022
I am going to up my game
and go for the nipple.

08:10.089 --> 08:11.624
(shrieks)

08:11.691 --> 08:13.259
Oh, my God, she's crying.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.095
I know what a nipple piercing
feels like.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.297
And it fucking kills.

08:18.364 --> 08:20.333
(screams)

08:20.399 --> 08:22.401
Now we all know
what her cum face is.

08:22.468 --> 08:23.803
You all right?

08:23.870 --> 08:25.438
I want me mam.

08:25.504 --> 08:28.374
The fact that Eve's done this
shows to me,

08:28.441 --> 08:30.643
she's the radgest out of all of them.

08:30.710 --> 08:33.346
Come on now. Now it's time
to get back to the house,

08:33.412 --> 08:37.783
and get ready, cos tonight
we're going out, out, out.

08:49.328 --> 08:53.799
We're back and it's time to
get ready for tonight. I am buzzing.

08:58.638 --> 09:01.274
(engine revs)

09:10.850 --> 09:13.052
Fancied a few beers before I go out.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.059
I'm chilling with Nathan

09:20.126 --> 09:23.429
and even though the new workers
are trying to impress,

09:23.496 --> 09:25.164
nobody really stands out yet.

09:27.066 --> 09:29.735
If I seen that lying about,
I'd probably pinch it.

09:40.613 --> 09:41.614
Who's that?

09:41.681 --> 09:44.450
This has got to be
another new worker.

09:44.517 --> 09:47.053
I just hope
they're gonna shake things up.

09:48.454 --> 09:51.290
Hi!
Oh, my God! Hello!

09:51.357 --> 09:52.358
Hello!

09:52.425 --> 09:55.861
The door opens. She is stunning.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.029
Oh, shit!

09:57.096 --> 10:00.132
I can only describe this thing
as an angel.

10:01.600 --> 10:06.973
Hola, hola, baby. I'm Elettra
and I'm 22. I am a party animal.

10:07.039 --> 10:08.808
Aah!
Hi, you all right?

10:08.874 --> 10:11.344
I'm Chloe. Nice to meet you.
Are you all right?

10:11.410 --> 10:13.079
Oh, my God! It's a new girl!

10:13.145 --> 10:15.247
I'm a bit confused. Why is she here?

10:15.314 --> 10:17.984
She's not even a Geordie.
She's not even English!

10:18.050 --> 10:20.786
Hello, I'm Sophie. Nice to meet you.

10:20.853 --> 10:22.455
Elettra.
Where you from?

10:22.521 --> 10:23.956
Italy.
Ciao.

10:24.023 --> 10:26.525
She's Italian
and she's got a dictionary.

10:26.592 --> 10:29.895
I hope it's a Geordie one.
We speak completely different

10:29.962 --> 10:31.497
to anyone else in the world.

10:31.564 --> 10:33.933
Elettra, has Anna sent you here?
Anna?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.402
She's, er, friend.
Yeah.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.404
Anna's friend recommended her.

10:38.471 --> 10:42.441
English might not be her language,
but she makes more sense than Chloe.

10:42.508 --> 10:45.344
Elettra, do you like girls or boys?

10:45.411 --> 10:47.079
I like fish. I like chicken.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.248
(they laugh)

10:49.315 --> 10:51.650
Elettra says
that she's a party girl.

10:51.717 --> 10:54.720
If she wants to fit in the house,
that is gonna work.

10:54.787 --> 10:58.224
It's time to get ready
and we're going out.

10:58.290 --> 11:00.159
(cork pops)

11:00.226 --> 11:01.460
Champagne, baby.

11:01.527 --> 11:03.562
I've got a good feeling
about tonight.

11:03.629 --> 11:05.598
Elettra is a Geordie at heart.

11:05.664 --> 11:08.134
Elettra ripped off me knickers.

11:08.200 --> 11:11.003
What... Eh?
What's going on?! What's going on?!

11:11.070 --> 11:14.006
This is heaven.
It's like watching porn.

11:14.073 --> 11:17.276
We didn't have this much sex
when we were together.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.412
I'm so fucking angry.

11:19.478 --> 11:20.780
I'm sorry, but I can't.

11:20.846 --> 11:23.416
I'm gonna be strong
and I'm gonna leave.

11:24.784 --> 11:26.786
(all) Geordie Shore! Why-aye!

11:29.989 --> 11:30.189
.

11:32.725 --> 11:32.925
.

11:39.398 --> 11:40.966
'You've been warned.'

11:49.308 --> 11:51.644
Elettra turned up
and sent the lads west.

11:51.710 --> 11:54.447
but I'm gonna go out of my way
to make sure she is mine.

11:54.513 --> 11:57.917
OK, I'll try and speak Italian.
Oh, OK.

11:57.983 --> 11:59.685
Me no speaka...

11:59.752 --> 12:01.520
Marty have my attention.

12:01.587 --> 12:05.925
He have, er, good eye, good smile.
He's like my style.

12:05.991 --> 12:07.693
Lovely eyes.
Oh!

12:07.760 --> 12:10.296
This girl's talking to me
and I'm talking back.

12:10.362 --> 12:12.865
But I don't think anyone knows
what's going on.

12:12.932 --> 12:16.001
At the end of the day,
I'm staring at her, falling in love.

12:16.068 --> 12:19.305
Elettra, I'm gonna go get ready.

12:19.371 --> 12:20.906
Love you.

12:20.973 --> 12:22.975
Ti amo.
Oh!

12:23.042 --> 12:26.812
The boys think only inner things.
Vagina. Like this.

12:26.879 --> 12:29.348
(imitates heartbeat)

12:29.415 --> 12:31.383
Fucking Jesus Christ almighty.

12:36.522 --> 12:38.924
I have this baby, baby.

12:38.991 --> 12:41.260
I have a gift. Champagne, baby!

12:41.327 --> 12:43.729
(cork pops, they cheer)

12:46.632 --> 12:48.701
Go, Aaron!
Come on, Aaron!

12:48.767 --> 12:52.505
Elettra's only stepped through
the door and she's shown the newbies

12:52.571 --> 12:55.841
how it's actually done.
And she's not even a Geordie.

12:55.908 --> 12:58.344
Elettra's first night.
Everyone, cheers.

12:58.410 --> 12:59.979
Let's get smashed.

13:00.045 --> 13:01.547
(they cheer)

13:01.614 --> 13:02.882
Taxis!

13:03.883 --> 13:07.887
I'm excited. I've got a good feeling
about tonight. It's gonna be big.

13:14.894 --> 13:16.495
Party!
Party!

13:23.569 --> 13:24.904
We get to town.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.706
It's weird cos there's
a fucking lot of people here.

13:32.077 --> 13:35.047
If Elettra wants to fit into
this house and Newcastle

13:35.114 --> 13:38.117
and be a Geordie,
she's gotta learn the lingo.

13:46.525 --> 13:49.728
Sophie tried to teach me, like,
Geordie word,

13:49.795 --> 13:51.797
and she say, "Why-aye!"

14:03.876 --> 14:05.077
(shrieks)

14:05.144 --> 14:06.645
What the hell has happened?

14:06.712 --> 14:11.383
This random Italian bird dragging
round Eve by her thong. What... Eh?

14:11.450 --> 14:13.285
What's going on?
What's going on?

14:13.352 --> 14:15.821
The new girl's
ripped my knickers off.

14:15.888 --> 14:18.224
What the fuck?
This is gonna be a good night.

14:25.164 --> 14:27.733
I haven't spoke to Marty
since I've been back.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.803
But I know I need to. I'm scared
to see what he's gonna say,

14:30.869 --> 14:32.605
cos I still like him.

14:42.081 --> 14:47.119
Marty's not gonna get with anyone in
the house. Though we're not together,

14:47.186 --> 14:50.055
it shows that he cares enough
not to rub it in me face.

14:57.663 --> 15:00.733
I've said this to Chloe before,
and it's kept her on side.

15:00.799 --> 15:04.503
I don't wanna be in a relationship.
I'm trying to graft Elettra.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.905
But I don't wanna
lose her friendship.

15:17.283 --> 15:19.618
What the hell is going on here?

15:19.685 --> 15:23.489
Marnie, Elettra and Chloe,
all necking on.

15:23.555 --> 15:24.990
Get the "wet floor" signs.

15:27.393 --> 15:30.562
For the first night,
I decided to kiss only girls,

15:30.629 --> 15:33.599
because I don't want
to create problems.

15:34.867 --> 15:36.902
I thought Chloe was mental,

15:36.969 --> 15:39.405
but this Elettra
puts Chloe to shame.

15:39.471 --> 15:42.207
She's fucking radge.
You're my type of girl.

15:44.243 --> 15:46.445
Elettra is a Geordie at heart.

15:46.512 --> 15:48.047
The girl is bat-shit crazy.

15:49.882 --> 15:53.519
We're drinking. We're celebrating.
Everyone's in such a good mood.

15:53.585 --> 15:55.120
Tonight's gonna be amazing.

16:00.726 --> 16:04.163
I see Aaron and Elettra
dancing and getting all flirty.

16:04.229 --> 16:07.399
I'm not having this.
Elettra, come here. I want a turn.

16:09.601 --> 16:12.338
Marty, you cheeky little man.
Whatever.

16:12.404 --> 16:15.974
It does seem, for some fucked-up
reason, she has the eye for you.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.349
Fuck me. This girl is fit.

16:23.415 --> 16:26.051
Instant stiffy.
She's grinding all over us.

16:26.118 --> 16:29.154
She's pouring lime on her tits.
This is heaven.

16:31.290 --> 16:34.560
I knew seeing Marty
all over another girl would hurt us,

16:34.626 --> 16:38.097
but it's a test, and reacting
in the past has got me into trouble.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.232
I need to stay strong.

16:44.236 --> 16:47.639
I know I said to Chloe
that I wouldn't, but look at her.

16:50.776 --> 16:54.413
Marty want to kiss me, but no, no,
no. Not tonight. You have to wait.

16:58.784 --> 17:01.019
You know,
Elettra makes me feel alive,

17:01.086 --> 17:02.888
so I'm gonna play the long game.

17:02.955 --> 17:06.425
Me and Chloe aren't together.
She's gonna have to understand.

17:10.762 --> 17:14.366
This morning, I've had a mare.
I said I was gonna get my clit done.

17:14.433 --> 17:16.402
I only ended up getting my ear done.

17:16.468 --> 17:19.304
I need to prove to this lot
I've got what it takes.

17:19.371 --> 17:22.040
I need to step up to the mark.
I've got a plan.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.881
This is bound to impress
the originals.

17:31.016 --> 17:35.521
Me and Chloe have sex positions
down to a T.

17:41.560 --> 17:45.197
Gary's hairy little hole
is rubbing all over Marty.

17:45.264 --> 17:48.434
I thought I'd like that,
but it's actually knocking me sick.

17:51.570 --> 17:55.707
I have a boyfriend, but at the end
of the day, this is a bit of fun.

17:55.774 --> 17:59.812
Me and Aaron are friends now and
I know my boyfriend trusts us 100%.

18:03.549 --> 18:06.185
The couple that
I'm enjoying watching the most

18:06.251 --> 18:09.688
is Marnie and Aaron because
I know that they've had sex before,

18:09.755 --> 18:12.424
and there's feelings.
It's like watching porn.

18:15.894 --> 18:19.565
Going through these positions is
bringing back memories. Good ones.

18:22.668 --> 18:24.937
Look at Marnie. She has a boyfriend

18:25.003 --> 18:28.841
and she can't keep off Aaron. You
can't have your cake and scran it.

18:31.009 --> 18:34.680
What's with Aaron? We didn't have
this much sex when we were together.

18:35.848 --> 18:38.317
It's given us a little twinge.

18:40.853 --> 18:43.055
(they cheer)

18:43.121 --> 18:46.525
Abbie announces that me and Marnie
are the winners. Of course.

18:46.592 --> 18:50.996
Our relationship wasn't the best,
but one thing we had was good sex.

19:00.005 --> 19:03.408
I'll always love Aaron,
maybe not the same way I love Lewis,

19:03.475 --> 19:06.345
but this is a really hard situation.

19:06.411 --> 19:09.081
If Aaron gets with a new girl,
I can't say anything.

19:09.147 --> 19:11.483
That doesn't mean
I won't be bothered by it.

19:14.119 --> 19:15.821
Will you fucking look at them?

19:15.888 --> 19:19.558
Aaron's being sucked into whatever
bullshit Marnie is giving him.

19:26.598 --> 19:29.768
Tonight has been amazing.
The energy was insane.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.004
But now, it's time to get home.

19:32.070 --> 19:33.839
Everyone, everyone! Let's go!

19:38.944 --> 19:42.648
Marnie's pissing us off. I'm gonna
give her a few truths about Aaron.

19:57.162 --> 19:59.731
What is Marty's problem?
I've had a good night

19:59.798 --> 20:01.800
and he's turning it
into an argument.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.836
Why don't you just
keep your fucking nose out?

20:21.186 --> 20:23.255
I can't hold it.
I'm about to explode.

20:25.090 --> 20:27.392
(indistinct shouting)

20:30.696 --> 20:34.366
I'm so fucking angry. I need out
of this taxi and away from Marnie.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.438
I literally can't stand Martin.

20:39.504 --> 20:42.007
He's a little troublemaker.
I want him gone.

20:46.411 --> 20:48.447
I'm happy and I love my boyfriend,

20:48.513 --> 20:50.449
but I am also living with my ex

20:50.515 --> 20:53.118
and I don't need Martin
making it harder for us.

20:57.089 --> 21:00.058
Things got out of hand in that taxi
and I'm sorry.

21:00.125 --> 21:04.229
But fuck me, Marnie knows exactly
how to wind me up.

21:04.296 --> 21:06.331
I've a bra on me head and don't care.

21:08.467 --> 21:10.168
Why are you and Marty fighting?

21:10.235 --> 21:13.105
We're fighting cos he was using you
to make me upset.

21:13.171 --> 21:14.706
But I wasn't there, though!

21:14.773 --> 21:18.210
The hard thing is, Marnie is me ex,
but we're getting on very well,

21:18.276 --> 21:21.046
but Marty's me mate,
so I'm stuck in the middle.

21:21.113 --> 21:24.149
As far as I'm concerned,
there's no way I'm taking sides.

21:24.216 --> 21:27.185
(cries)
Listen, we're in a good place.

21:27.252 --> 21:29.321
No, we're not.
Yes, we are.

21:29.388 --> 21:32.724
For some reason, Martin hates it
when me and Aaron are friends.

21:32.791 --> 21:36.495
He loves it when we're not speaking.
He's a little troublemaker.

21:36.561 --> 21:41.500
(indistinct)
You always will. You always will.

21:41.566 --> 21:44.770
Where am I now? Where am I now?
Where am I now?

21:44.836 --> 21:47.839
The fact Marnie's making a deal
of Marty's accusations

21:47.906 --> 21:50.308
makes me think
there's something going on.

21:54.713 --> 21:56.281
Kebab!

21:56.348 --> 21:58.316
Kebab to the head.

21:58.383 --> 22:00.652
My name's kebab. What's yours?

22:01.687 --> 22:04.423
Marnie. You wanna go to bed?

22:04.489 --> 22:06.858
Yeah. Can I get some food?

22:06.925 --> 22:10.362
To be honest, I love Aaron to bits,
and I'll always care about him.

22:10.429 --> 22:14.466
It's not easy living with your ex
when everyone has an opinion.

22:14.533 --> 22:15.667
I love yous.

22:23.709 --> 22:25.777
All this stuff with Marnie's
upset us.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.579
I just need to speak to Chloe.

22:27.646 --> 22:31.116
Despite this shit, she's the closest
person to me in this house.

22:33.251 --> 22:35.187
No, I can't. I'm sorry.

22:35.253 --> 22:36.555
Martin, listen...

22:37.956 --> 22:39.157
I know.

22:40.158 --> 22:41.560
I know...

22:42.627 --> 22:45.263
I'm your best friend.
I love you to bits.

22:45.330 --> 22:49.367
I wanna be with you so much,
but you promised me tonight

22:49.434 --> 22:51.436
that you'd only get with me...

23:02.314 --> 23:04.282
Martin, I've had enough.

23:04.349 --> 23:08.053
You bring out the worst in me. I'm
gonna be strong and I'm gonna leave.

23:08.120 --> 23:12.290
I'm sorry, but I can't.
I cannot stay with you. I'm sorry.

23:12.357 --> 23:15.060
Sorry. I'm sorry,
but I've been too hurt before.

23:15.127 --> 23:18.396
I've been full-on hurt.
I'm not doing it again.

23:18.463 --> 23:21.166
Fucking hell, Chloe,
what's going on?

23:21.233 --> 23:24.069
I think I've finally
grown some balls!

23:27.305 --> 23:30.342
Well, this is a first,
Chloe's pied us off.

23:30.408 --> 23:32.844
She wouldn't stay with us
when I needed her.

23:42.988 --> 23:46.057
We should have a catch-up
about who's impressing who.

23:46.124 --> 23:48.226
We live with the people
Anna chooses.

23:48.293 --> 23:49.694
He's just so quiet

23:49.761 --> 23:52.364
He's gonna be
like a circumcised willy, chopped.

23:52.430 --> 23:55.867
Aah!
We're playing electric football.

23:55.934 --> 23:58.503
Good luck, guys.
I'm on one!

23:58.570 --> 24:01.740
You shouldn't be a troublemaker.
Ah, you fuck!

24:01.807 --> 24:03.642
It's more painful than anal!

24:04.910 --> 24:06.912
(all) Geordie Shore! Why-aye!

24:09.481 --> 24:09.681
.

24:12.184 --> 24:12.384
.

24:16.988 --> 24:21.126
'If you don't like sexual banter,
nudity and the rest, turn over now.'

24:31.970 --> 24:33.338
I'm fuming still.

24:33.405 --> 24:37.309
Like, I don't understand why someone
would wanna be like that.

24:37.375 --> 24:39.945
Last night, me and Marty
had a massive row.

24:40.011 --> 24:41.746
He was trying to cause trouble.

24:41.813 --> 24:45.383
He was trying to insinuate something
was going on when it wasn't.

24:45.450 --> 24:47.619
I was speaking to Martin last night.

24:47.686 --> 24:51.223
Tried to drag her to the shag pad.
"Chloe, you're my best friend."

24:51.289 --> 24:55.560
I wanted so bad to stay with him cos
I like him like that, but I didn't.

24:55.627 --> 24:58.263
I woke up this morning
and I still can't believe

24:58.330 --> 25:02.701
that I finally pied Marty.
I feel smug as a bug.

25:02.767 --> 25:05.570
Like, I've actually pied
someone I actually like.

25:05.637 --> 25:08.039
Yeah. Loads.
Which I'm proud of you for.

25:08.106 --> 25:11.276
Hats off for that cos that is hard.
I know that's hard for you.

25:17.315 --> 25:19.517
I am fucking dying.

25:23.989 --> 25:26.024
Are you st... Are you still angry?

25:26.091 --> 25:29.361
All I was trying to do last night,
was help the both of yous.

25:29.427 --> 25:32.597
Cos Marnie was over the top.
She was flirting far too much.

25:32.664 --> 25:36.067
I don't know why that tubby little
tosspot is looking out for me.

25:36.134 --> 25:39.304
Don't get us wrong, I like that,
but I can look after myself.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.841
Did see you fucking try
to get Chloe in the shag pad.

25:42.908 --> 25:44.976
I wasn't trying to neck on
or anything.

25:45.043 --> 25:47.245
We had two blankets. Blanket each.

25:47.312 --> 25:48.813
I had a fight with Marnie,

25:48.880 --> 25:52.017
and when I needed Chloe as a friend,
she fucking pied us!

25:52.083 --> 25:53.451
I'm all over Elettra now.

25:53.518 --> 25:55.921
(they laugh)

26:04.829 --> 26:06.865
(phone rings)

26:06.932 --> 26:08.733
Anna Banana.

26:08.800 --> 26:12.404
We're all sitting round having
breakfast and the phone rings.

26:12.470 --> 26:15.040
No, Anna, please,
I don't wanna go to work today.

26:15.106 --> 26:16.741
Me head is banging.

26:16.808 --> 26:20.745
"Hi, Sophie. I wanna see
all you originals tonight,

26:20.812 --> 26:22.747
to give me an update on the newbies."

26:22.814 --> 26:24.282
OK, we'll see you there.

26:24.349 --> 26:28.486
"One more thing.
I want Gary, Marty, Nathan and Marnie

26:28.553 --> 26:33.024
to take Eve and Zahida
to test out a Geordie Tour."

26:33.091 --> 26:35.627
OK.
"Bye, Sophie." Tada.

26:35.694 --> 26:37.862
Sweet as a nut,
no work for me today.

26:37.929 --> 26:41.533
I've gotta let the others know
they've got to take Zahida and Eve

26:41.599 --> 26:43.168
out to work with them today.

26:43.234 --> 26:45.971
You are doing a job
for Geordie Tours.

26:46.037 --> 26:48.006
Yes!
Yay!

26:48.073 --> 26:50.942
And she said that, the originals,

26:51.009 --> 26:53.044
we all need to meet her
for a catch up.

26:53.111 --> 26:54.245
Really?

26:54.312 --> 26:57.449
This new work situation
is starting to get interesting.

26:57.515 --> 27:01.319
Before we meet Anna,
we have to figure out who we prefer.

27:01.386 --> 27:03.588
Let's get ready. Let's get ready.

27:11.529 --> 27:12.931
Who's excited?

27:14.632 --> 27:17.002
Anna's sent us out to trial
what I reckon

27:17.068 --> 27:19.971
will be another radge activity
for the business.

27:20.038 --> 27:21.973
And we've got Zahida
and Eve with us.

27:27.145 --> 27:29.414
Anna's got us playing
electric football.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.249
It's simple. You play football.

27:31.316 --> 27:34.586
However, you can get
an electric shock at any time.

27:34.652 --> 27:38.289
Gaz and Marnie, you're gonna be
on the side-lines with the controls.

27:38.356 --> 27:43.294
Oh! Now this should show us if the
workers have got a sense of humour.

27:43.361 --> 27:44.629
Good luck, guys!

27:44.696 --> 27:46.297
Everyone's gonna play

27:46.364 --> 27:48.900
while me and Gary just sit back
and zap them all.

27:48.967 --> 27:52.003
I know exactly who I'm going to zap.
Aah! Fuck!

27:52.070 --> 27:53.972
Fuck! Fuck!
Marty.

27:54.039 --> 27:57.042
Ready?
Marnie, please, please. I'm sorry.

27:57.108 --> 27:58.810
Sorry, Martin, does that hurt?

27:58.877 --> 28:01.346
Well, you shouldn't be
such a troublemaker.

28:01.413 --> 28:04.049
Aah! You fuck! Ooh!

28:04.115 --> 28:06.117
Marnie, please, I'm sorry.

28:06.184 --> 28:09.888
I've said sorry. We're part of the
same family and we've got to get on.

28:09.954 --> 28:11.856
And I want her to stop shocking us!

28:11.923 --> 28:13.224
Aah!

28:13.291 --> 28:15.627
Oh! Fuck this!

28:15.693 --> 28:18.129
Martin said sorry,
but I've not forgiven him,

28:18.196 --> 28:20.765
and I've still got the buzzer.
Ow!

28:20.832 --> 28:21.966
(they laugh)

28:22.033 --> 28:27.005
This is the most fun I've had
in a long time. Zzz!

28:27.072 --> 28:28.940
(laughs)
Zzz!

28:29.007 --> 28:31.176
Just fucking score, man!

28:31.242 --> 28:33.078
Zzz!
Aah! Fuck!

28:33.144 --> 28:35.713
Fucking hell,
it's more painful than anal.

28:42.554 --> 28:45.824
Fair play to Zahida and Eve.
No red cards for them two.

28:45.890 --> 28:49.127
They both got stuck in
and proved they're up for a laugh.

28:50.228 --> 28:52.097
Aah!

28:52.163 --> 28:54.799
Anna wants to know
if we'd recommended that.

28:54.866 --> 28:58.403
After Marnie shocked
the shit out of me, no chance.

28:58.470 --> 28:59.838
That was horrible.

28:59.904 --> 29:03.108
Now let's head home
and get ready for the night.

29:03.174 --> 29:04.175
I'm on one!

29:15.587 --> 29:18.356
We all get back from work,
and me and the originals

29:18.423 --> 29:22.594
have to go get ready to meet Anna
and tell her about all the newbies.

29:26.931 --> 29:29.300
See you soon.
(they all say goodbye)

29:29.367 --> 29:31.169
See you later.

29:32.570 --> 29:35.440
I'd love to be a fly on the wall
at these convos.

29:35.507 --> 29:37.041
I've worked hard to fit in.

29:37.108 --> 29:39.477
I'm having such a wicked time
with this lot,

29:39.544 --> 29:41.846
and I really wanna be part
of this family.

29:41.913 --> 29:43.882
I don't wanna go.
I don't wanna go.

29:43.948 --> 29:45.250
I've just unpacked.

29:53.291 --> 29:57.862
Before Anna gets here we should
catch up about who's impressing who.

29:57.929 --> 30:00.899
We need to put together
who's doing good and bad.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.367
At the end of the day,

30:02.433 --> 30:05.003
we've gotta live
with the people Anna chooses.

30:07.839 --> 30:12.043
The reason it's good is, she showed
the rest what they should be like.

30:12.110 --> 30:14.612
I was like,
if you can imagine walking in,

30:14.679 --> 30:17.849
making a good impression,
that's what you need to do.

30:17.916 --> 30:21.186
Elettra has came out of the blue,
took everybody by surprise.

30:21.252 --> 30:24.622
She makes everyone up their game.
That's a spanner in the works.

30:24.689 --> 30:25.723
What about Billy?

30:25.790 --> 30:30.061
He's just so quiet. Like,
he hasn't got what you lads have.

30:30.128 --> 30:32.697
He thinks he's somebody.
He thinks he's a boy.

30:32.764 --> 30:34.265
You're not in here already.

30:34.332 --> 30:38.169
Thing is with Billy,
he's good looking. He's very sweet.

30:38.236 --> 30:41.372
But he's very quiet
and he just doesn't stand out.

30:41.439 --> 30:43.141
The girls are all right.

30:43.208 --> 30:45.643
For me, if I had to put them
in a leader board,

30:45.710 --> 30:48.413
I would go Zahida...
Yep.

30:48.479 --> 30:51.115
Sarah.
...Sarah, Abbie...

30:52.584 --> 30:55.220
Abbie's just like,
all right at everything.

30:55.286 --> 30:56.588
This is a tough one.

30:56.654 --> 31:00.191
If I had to choose,
I'd live with Abbie over Billy.

31:00.992 --> 31:04.062
So what are we gonna tell Anna?
Billy?

31:04.128 --> 31:06.664
If Billy doesn't start talking
and stepping up

31:06.731 --> 31:09.534
he's gonna be like
a circumcised willy, chopped.

31:18.276 --> 31:19.410
Hi, team.

31:19.477 --> 31:20.778
Hi, Anna.

31:20.845 --> 31:23.014
Feeding time at the zoo here,
isn't it?

31:23.081 --> 31:25.316
No, thank you. Watching me figure.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.552
Yeah, sure you are, Anna! Oooh!

31:28.886 --> 31:31.789
I'm really excited to hear
what you've got to say.

31:31.856 --> 31:34.559
Who's the best? Who's up to the job?

31:35.426 --> 31:37.028
That's what I wanna hear.

31:37.095 --> 31:39.764
We're throwing names of people
we wanna live with,

31:39.831 --> 31:43.334
but Anna thinks we're throwing
around names of the best workers.

31:44.535 --> 31:48.606
Anybody that really is not cutting
the mustard? Anybody that's not?

31:48.673 --> 31:52.377
Everyone agrees there's one person
who hasn't made an impression,

31:52.443 --> 31:54.646
and I'm sorry,
but, Billy, that's you.

31:54.712 --> 31:56.648
Billy. We have, Billy.

31:56.714 --> 31:58.449
I'm quite surprised at that.

32:01.686 --> 32:03.254
He did not!

32:03.321 --> 32:05.523
We're telling Anna
Billy is shit at work,

32:05.590 --> 32:08.559
but it's not just that.
The lad's got nae craic.

32:08.626 --> 32:12.497
I really value your opinions, and
you know what, I think on this one,

32:12.563 --> 32:15.667
you've all pulled together
as a team. I'm impressed.

32:15.733 --> 32:19.237
I find it weird that Anna
has given us responsibility,

32:19.304 --> 32:22.607
but we won't let you down, Anna.
I promise you that.

32:22.674 --> 32:26.377
I'm gonna have a little think about
what every one of yous has said.

32:26.444 --> 32:29.147
So you're out tonight,
you've got the night off.

32:29.213 --> 32:31.049
See you later.

32:31.115 --> 32:34.519
We've got tonight off. It gives
the new workers another chance.

32:34.585 --> 32:38.056
Let's get back to the house,
get ready and get out.

32:42.327 --> 32:44.762
Marty is absolutely buzzing
about Elettra.

32:46.431 --> 32:47.799
Hello, everybody!

32:48.800 --> 32:50.868
I can see her
being part of this family.

32:52.070 --> 32:53.604
Oh, feels good.

32:53.671 --> 32:57.575
You're a fuckin' head-fuck and you
made me look full-on fucking crazy!

32:57.642 --> 33:00.478
That girl needs a round of applause.

33:00.545 --> 33:02.447
Fuck off, Martin.

33:02.513 --> 33:04.515
(all) Geordie Shore! Why-aye!

33:06.951 --> 33:07.151
.

33:09.687 --> 33:09.887
.

33:14.992 --> 33:16.961
'Turn over if you can't handle it.'

33:20.765 --> 33:22.934
We're at the house
with no time to lose.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.904
Everyone needs to get glammed up.
We're out and gonna get shitfaced.

33:29.874 --> 33:32.043
I've sprayed that in me fucking eye.

33:32.110 --> 33:34.846
Fucking horny as fuck.

33:34.912 --> 33:37.348
There's 19 million girls
in this house.

33:37.415 --> 33:40.451
The only one I would shag
is Elettra.

33:40.518 --> 33:42.687
It's, like, persistence, innit.

33:42.754 --> 33:45.523
Marty is absolutely buzzing
about Elettra.

33:45.590 --> 33:48.793
If he can break the language
barrier, he deserves a shag.

33:50.328 --> 33:51.996
Oh! I nearly missed that there.

34:01.406 --> 34:02.874
Looking good, girls.

34:04.041 --> 34:07.211
Everyone listen up. Tonight,
yous have a little challenge.

34:07.278 --> 34:09.813
I've got an idea
how to test these newbies

34:09.880 --> 34:11.849
to see if they can get cray
in the club.

34:11.916 --> 34:15.319
Individually, yous have all gotta
come up with your own games.

34:15.386 --> 34:17.288
We're gonna split into two groups.

34:17.355 --> 34:20.491
Yeah? And one by one, you'll come up
and present your game,

34:20.558 --> 34:23.960
explain it, and we're gonna judge
how well you run that game.

34:24.027 --> 34:27.665
I know I'm struggling with work
and I need to impress the originals.

34:27.732 --> 34:30.768
I definitely don't want
this experience to end soon.

34:30.835 --> 34:33.771
Start thinking of your games
for when we get to the club.

34:33.838 --> 34:37.641
Right, so has everyone got it, yeah?
Right, cheers to tonight!

34:37.708 --> 34:39.076
(they cheer)

34:39.143 --> 34:40.478
Oi, oi! Let's go!

34:43.246 --> 34:47.784
Tonight, we're all gonna get fucking
mortal. Who's with us on that?

34:47.851 --> 34:49.020
(they cheer)

34:49.085 --> 34:52.690
Everybody say, "Let's get mortal!"
But what is mortal?

34:52.757 --> 34:56.226
I don't understand what's happening,
but I'm so excited.

34:58.496 --> 35:01.566
We get to the club.
It's fucking party time.

35:01.632 --> 35:02.667
Let's get smashed.

35:07.638 --> 35:10.975
Cheers, cheers, cheers!
(they cheer)

35:11.042 --> 35:14.045
We get to the club.
Drinks are flowing, music's banging.

35:14.111 --> 35:16.147
There's cock and pussy everywhere.

35:20.384 --> 35:22.920
Everyone's having a wicked night.

35:22.987 --> 35:25.289
We're gonna put the new workers
to the test.

35:28.125 --> 35:31.562
With me, Marty and Aaron
is Elettra, Abbie and Zahida.

35:39.704 --> 35:41.439
I am loving my game.

35:41.506 --> 35:43.207
The shoe's on the other foot.

35:43.274 --> 35:46.244
I'm telling the lads what to do
and they're doing it.

35:47.912 --> 35:52.149
Fair play to Abbie. This is decent
craic and everybody is loving it.

35:54.118 --> 35:55.253
Yes!

35:56.754 --> 35:59.624
Right, so me Marnie,
Chloe and Sophie

35:59.690 --> 36:03.094
are gonna see what new workers
Billy, Eve and Sarah are made of.

36:07.064 --> 36:09.867
Get Chloe up, blindfold her,
get them up to kiss her.

36:09.934 --> 36:11.636
Chloe's got to guess the kisser.

36:12.770 --> 36:16.207
I can't see a thing.
the first kisser is stinky,

36:16.274 --> 36:18.476
bad breath and fucking shit.

36:21.546 --> 36:22.780
I'm necking on.

36:22.847 --> 36:26.083
No chance she'll not get this.
We're practically a couple.

36:37.328 --> 36:39.797
Chloe,
I'm actually disappointed in you!

36:45.469 --> 36:47.872
Wheelbarrow race?
We're not in school.

36:52.443 --> 36:54.712
Zahida, that was shite.

36:56.080 --> 36:57.481
Hello, everybody!

36:57.548 --> 37:00.451
My game is to do as many shots
as you can in 30 seconds

37:00.518 --> 37:02.119
without using your hands.

37:02.186 --> 37:03.287
Let's do this.

37:05.523 --> 37:08.960
Chloe is shit at taking shots
and she's shit at sucking dick.

37:09.026 --> 37:11.095
I know for a fine fact
I've got this one.

37:11.162 --> 37:13.130
Nathan!
(they cheer)

37:20.638 --> 37:23.441
It's my turn and I want to see
who is the best dancer.

37:30.147 --> 37:31.315
(screams)

37:35.052 --> 37:39.056
What's this, Aaron's just been pied
off Elettra? You fucking charva.

37:39.123 --> 37:40.291
Woo-hoo!

37:42.293 --> 37:45.663
Sarah barged in
with a fucking straw microphone.

37:45.730 --> 37:47.465
I love this already.

37:49.467 --> 37:51.936
You've gotta get the drink
to the bottom.

37:52.003 --> 37:54.038
The team that spills the least wins.

37:55.806 --> 37:59.010
Out of my three workers tonight,
I've got to hand it to Sarah.

37:59.076 --> 38:00.878
She absolutely nailed it.

38:03.881 --> 38:07.084
Out of my lot, I've got to say
that Abbie smashed it tonight.

38:07.151 --> 38:10.388
If she carries on, I can see her
becoming part of this family.

38:19.730 --> 38:21.999
We've had fun putting
newbies to the test,

38:22.066 --> 38:26.037
but now it's time to do what
we do best and get mortal.

38:38.816 --> 38:40.851
There was a time
when I did fancy Chloe,

38:40.918 --> 38:44.655
but I realised it didn't work as a
couple, but I need her as a friend.

38:54.365 --> 38:57.301
Everything what Marty is saying
is what I want to hear,

38:57.368 --> 39:00.805
but he's let me down so many times,
I can't let meself go back.

39:03.574 --> 39:06.811
Even though I care about Chloe
and I told her I wouldn't,

39:06.877 --> 39:10.548
if there's a chance with Elettra,
I would. I don't know who wouldn't.

39:21.826 --> 39:23.127
(whistles)

39:23.194 --> 39:25.162
Let's go!

39:25.229 --> 39:27.364
Tonight has been unreal

39:27.431 --> 39:31.535
and I'm so glad the original workers
have enjoyed it as much as we have.

39:41.612 --> 39:45.816
Tonight has been such a laugh.
All these newbies have played games

39:45.883 --> 39:47.585
and got us really mortal.

39:47.651 --> 39:50.521
So let's have a few more drinks
and more of a good laugh.

40:06.070 --> 40:09.340
I know I promised Chloe
I wouldn't get with anyone else,

40:09.406 --> 40:11.742
but all I'm thinking about now
is Elettra

40:11.809 --> 40:14.345
and how fucking spot on she looks.

40:15.679 --> 40:17.515
No, no, no. If you want...

40:19.483 --> 40:21.619
Elettra won't come to the shag pad,

40:21.685 --> 40:24.054
so looks like it's
a downstairs bedroom job.

40:29.226 --> 40:31.929
We're all having
some lovely family vibes,

40:31.996 --> 40:34.865
and then I noticed Marty
and Elettra are missing.

40:34.932 --> 40:36.133
What's going on?

40:40.638 --> 40:42.006
I've wanted this moment

40:42.072 --> 40:45.242
since Elettra first walked
through that door.

40:45.309 --> 40:47.044
Oh! Feels good.

40:50.948 --> 40:52.783
Wait, wait, wait.

40:52.850 --> 40:55.119
Oh, Martin!

40:55.186 --> 40:56.520
Elettra!

40:57.454 --> 41:02.326
Marty has promised me over and over,
he will not get with anyone.

41:02.393 --> 41:04.228
You little liar.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.964
I'll leave
your engagement present here.

41:07.031 --> 41:09.133
I hope yous are happy together.

41:09.200 --> 41:12.403
You've been flirting with Alexa.
I like you as friends.

41:12.469 --> 41:14.839
"Chloe, you're the only girl."

41:14.905 --> 41:16.507
I said I like you as friends.

41:16.574 --> 41:18.943
I'm just about to tuck myself in,

41:19.009 --> 41:21.846
and I hear Chloe and Marty
at each other's throats.

41:21.912 --> 41:24.648
What's going on now?
You're a fucking head-fuck!

41:24.715 --> 41:27.017
And you made me look full on
fucking crazy!

41:27.084 --> 41:30.287
But I'm not. I nearly got chucked out
for fucking you!

41:30.354 --> 41:33.090
And the only person
I wanted in the house was you.

41:33.157 --> 41:35.693
I told you, don't hurt us,
but you fucking did.

41:35.759 --> 41:39.296
I'm finally telling Marty
everything he's ever done to me,

41:39.363 --> 41:41.799
and I feel fucking mint.

41:41.866 --> 41:45.703
Everyone's sick of your fucking shit.
You play with people's heads!

41:45.769 --> 41:48.339
You're not right!
What did I say? Let us speak.

41:48.405 --> 41:52.009
I'm trying to speak to Chloe. She
won't let us get a fucking word in.

41:52.076 --> 41:53.644
Let me talk!

41:53.711 --> 41:56.547
Fuck off, Martin. Fuck off.

41:56.614 --> 41:58.015
(cheering)

41:58.082 --> 42:00.784
Chloe is standing up for herself
against Marty.

42:00.851 --> 42:04.188
What that girl needs
is a round of applause.

42:04.255 --> 42:05.956
Well done, Chloe!

42:06.023 --> 42:09.226
Marty, you've done me a favour
tonight by kissing Elettra.

42:09.293 --> 42:12.696
It's made me realise I don't wanna
be with you. I'm a new woman.

42:12.763 --> 42:18.135
Why? Why has it taken you
this fucking long?

42:21.472 --> 42:23.440
Chloe's just had me life.

42:23.507 --> 42:25.609
It feels like
everyone's against us.

42:25.676 --> 42:27.811
Even Elettra's lost interest in us.

42:27.878 --> 42:29.747
I have to get
to the drawing board

42:29.813 --> 42:33.284
if I'm gonna sort this out
because this is a disaster.

42:40.090 --> 42:42.893
Oi, oi. (laughs)
I just felt me fanny flutter.

42:42.960 --> 42:44.561
Team sausage!

42:46.597 --> 42:48.799
I'm attracted to Sam.
I really fancy him.

42:48.866 --> 42:53.270
My dance moves have fucking worked,
because we're kissing in seconds.

42:54.905 --> 42:56.507
Aaron, if you wanna pull,

42:56.573 --> 42:59.343
it might be a good idea to stay away
from your ex.

42:59.410 --> 43:00.844
Go on, Sam.

43:00.911 --> 43:02.913
Sam's smashed. This is fun to watch.

43:04.315 --> 43:06.383
(they laugh)

43:38.449 --> 43:38.649
.
