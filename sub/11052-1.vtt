YOU A CHOICE?

07:57.060 --> 07:58.727

48:26.154 --> 48:27.620
KAFFIR'S WHAT SHE SAID
SHE'D NEVER CALL ME.

48:30.892 --> 48:32.258
ARE YOU SURE?

48:32.293 --> 48:34.293
YEAH, I'M SURE.

48:34.328 --> 48:35.995
I MESSED UP.

48:36.030 --> 48:37.563
SORRY.

48:38.666 --> 48:40.933
IT'S OK. REALLY.

48:44.806 --> 48:45.838
GOODNIGHT.

48:45.874 --> 48:48.141
GOODNIGHT.

49:54.876 --> 49:55.574
OH!

49:55.609 --> 49:57.643
I'M SORRY.

49:57.678 --> 50:01.247
NO, NO. IT'S OK.
YOU CAN READ.

50:01.282 --> 50:04.250
I THOUGHT I HEARD
SOMETHING OUT HERE

50:04.285 --> 50:05.451
AND JUST CAME TO CHECK.

50:07.055 --> 50:09.155
GO ON. SIT.

50:13.161 --> 50:16.128
WHAT ARE YOU READING?

50:19.633 --> 50:23.736
AH, "ROOTS." GOOD BOOK.

50:23.771 --> 50:27.139
IMPORTANT BOOK
HERE IN THE U.S.

50:27.175 --> 50:29.876
IT HELPED AMERICANS--
WHITE AMERICANS--

50:29.911 --> 50:32.111
SEE THE HORROR OF SLAVERY.

50:34.482 --> 50:38.050
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU WERE TAUGHT
ANYTHING IN SOUTH AFRICA

50:38.086 --> 50:39.818
ABOUT AMERICAN SLAVERY?

50:41.789 --> 50:43.356
NO.

50:43.391 --> 50:44.357
FIGURES.

50:44.392 --> 50:47.026
WELL, YOU PICKED
A GREAT BOOK.

50:47.061 --> 50:49.295
PROBABLY THE BEST
BOOK IN THE HOUSE.

50:49.330 --> 50:51.630
AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE A
CHANCE TO FINISH IT,

50:51.665 --> 50:53.532
YOU FEEL FREE TO TAKE
IT HOME WITH YOU.

50:53.567 --> 50:55.467
THANK YOU.

50:57.272 --> 50:58.271
DON'T MENTION IT.

51:00.308 --> 51:02.508
WELL, I'VE GOT AN EARLY DAY.

51:02.543 --> 51:04.043
GOODNIGHT.

51:04.078 --> 51:05.945
GOODNIGHT.

51:05.980 --> 51:07.313
MR. DELLUMS...

51:10.018 --> 51:12.084
I'M SORRY.

51:12.120 --> 51:13.986
FOR WHAT?

51:14.022 --> 51:17.823
FOR MAKING YOU THINK I
CALLED PIPER A KAFFIR.

51:17.858 --> 51:20.993
WELL, I DIDN'T THINK...

51:21.029 --> 51:22.561
YOU HEARD ME?

51:25.066 --> 51:27.800
BUT, IT'S OK.

51:27.835 --> 51:29.969
MAYBE I WAS SUPPOSED
TO HEAR IT.

51:30.004 --> 51:33.172
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE A
BAD PERSON, MAHREE.

51:33.207 --> 51:35.408
I JUST THINK YOU'VE BEEN
TAUGHT SOME BAD THINGS.

51:38.879 --> 51:41.680
I'M GOING TO BED.

51:41.715 --> 51:44.050
AND SO SHOULD YOU.
SCHOOL STARTS TOMORROW.

51:44.085 --> 51:47.053
AND FALLING ASLEEP IN CLASS
ON THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL

51:47.088 --> 51:48.620
IS FROWNED ON
HERE IN AMERICA.

51:50.425 --> 51:54.060
I KNOW. I'VE DONE IT.

51:57.398 --> 51:58.764
GOODNIGHT.

51:58.799 --> 51:59.798
GOODNIGHT.

52:14.548 --> 52:16.315
SO, WHAT DO YOU SEE
WHEN YOU GET UP IN
THE MORNING

52:16.351 --> 52:17.883
AND LOOK OUT YOUR
BEDROOM WINDOW?

52:17.918 --> 52:20.919
I SEE GRASS,
SOME TREES.

52:20.955 --> 52:23.990
NO, I MEAN WHAT KIND OF
ANIMALS DO YOU SEE?

52:24.025 --> 52:26.192
GIRAFFES? LIONS?
TIGERS? WHAT?

52:26.227 --> 52:28.127
I SEE COWS AND SHEEP.

52:28.162 --> 52:30.196
SOME DOGS AND CATS.
LOTS OF BIRDS.

52:30.231 --> 52:35.434
SHEEP? DOGS? I THOUGHT
YOU LIVED IN AFRICA.

52:35.470 --> 52:38.304
I DO. BUT YOU'VE PROBABLY
SEEN AS MANY LIONS

52:38.339 --> 52:39.305
AND ELEPHANTS
AS I HAVE.

52:39.340 --> 52:41.007
YEAH, BUT ONLY
AT THE CIRCUS.

52:41.042 --> 52:43.242
WANT TO KNOW WHERE I SAW
MY FIRST AND LAST LION?

52:43.277 --> 52:44.276
WHERE?

52:44.312 --> 52:45.177
THE JOHANNESBURG ZOO.

52:45.213 --> 52:46.445
YOU'RE KIDDING!

52:46.481 --> 52:48.280
I'M NOT. WE HAVE
GAME RESERVES,

52:48.316 --> 52:50.082
SORT OF LIKE BIG PARKS

52:50.118 --> 52:51.050
WHERE YOU CAN GO
AND SEE THEM,

52:51.085 --> 52:52.318
BUT I'VE NEVER
BEEN TO ONE.

52:52.353 --> 52:54.420
WELL, WHAT'S THE FUN IN
GROWING UP IN AFRICA

52:54.455 --> 52:57.589
IF YOU CAN'T GET
CHASED BY A RHINO?

52:57.625 --> 52:59.591
WELL, HERE'S WHERE
YOU GUYS GET OFF.

52:59.627 --> 53:01.460
CHILDREN, TO THE
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

53:01.496 --> 53:02.895
JUNIOR HIGH FOR
THE ADULTS.

53:02.930 --> 53:05.831
RUN ALONG NOW. YOU
DON'T WANT TO BE LATE.

53:05.866 --> 53:06.999
YES, YES.

53:18.779 --> 53:19.845
EXCUSE ME?

53:19.880 --> 53:21.980
I'M A NEW EXCHANGE
STUDENT.

53:22.016 --> 53:23.015
OH, THAT'S YOUR LINE.

53:23.051 --> 53:24.883
EXCHANGE STUDENTS
AND TRANSFERS.

53:24.919 --> 53:26.385
WELCOME TO WILSON.

53:27.488 --> 53:30.622
WELL, I GUESS I'LL
SEE YOU AT LUNCH.

53:30.658 --> 53:32.458
BYE.

54:02.557 --> 54:03.922
OH.

54:12.233 --> 54:14.666
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
SAY YOU'RE SORRY.

54:14.702 --> 54:16.602
SHE IS SORRY.

54:17.505 --> 54:18.637
I DIDN'T
HEAR IT.

54:18.672 --> 54:19.705
THEN TAKE OFF THE HELMET.

54:20.441 --> 54:21.607
OOPS, MY MISTAKE.

54:21.642 --> 54:23.909
YOU'RE NOT WEARING ONE.
THAT'S YOUR HEAD.

54:25.813 --> 54:28.080
DON'T LET THOSE DUMB
FOOTBALL PLAYERS
SCARE YOU.

54:28.116 --> 54:29.148
THEY'RE ALL TALK.

54:29.183 --> 54:30.516
JUST LIKE MY
BROTHERS.

54:30.551 --> 54:31.850
SEE YOU LATER.

54:49.003 --> 54:50.636
HEY. LINE'S MOVING.

54:59.847 --> 55:01.580
SO, HOW WAS SCHOOL?

55:01.616 --> 55:03.882
EVERY YEAR YOU ASK
THE SAME THING.

55:03.917 --> 55:05.584
EVERY YEAR THE
ANSWER'S THE SAME--

55:05.620 --> 55:07.186
THE FIRST DAY OF
SCHOOL'S ALWAYS

55:07.221 --> 55:08.621
BORING!
BORING!

55:08.656 --> 55:11.290
WITH A CAPITAL "B".

55:11.325 --> 55:13.459
WELL, I GOT A COUPLE
OF DECENT CLASSES.

55:13.494 --> 55:14.360
HMMM.

55:14.395 --> 55:15.994
HOW WAS YOUR DAY, MAHREE?

55:16.030 --> 55:17.896
SHE HAS HOMEWORK
ALREADY.

55:17.931 --> 55:19.965
TOO BAD.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.267
WHAT IS IT?

55:21.302 --> 55:22.434
UM, A BOOK
REPORT.

55:22.470 --> 55:23.902
WHAT'S THE BOOK?

55:23.937 --> 55:27.406
UM, IT'S CALLED "CRY, THE
BELOVED COUNTRY" BY ALAN PATON.

55:27.441 --> 55:29.675
OH, I THINK WE HAVE THAT BOOK.

55:29.710 --> 55:31.410
IT'S ABOUT SOUTH AFRICA, RIGHT?

55:31.445 --> 55:32.711
I DON'T KNOW.

55:32.746 --> 55:34.480
I'M ALMOST SURE IT IS.

55:34.515 --> 55:37.183
WELL, IF WE DO HAVE IT,
IT WILL SAVE YOU A TRIP
TO THE LIBRARY.

55:37.218 --> 55:39.051
THOUGH, YOU PROBABLY
ALREADY READ IT.

55:39.086 --> 55:40.452
MAYBE.

55:40.488 --> 55:44.089
THIS BOOK WAS
REQUIRED READING AT
MY HIGH SCHOOL.

55:44.124 --> 55:48.294
OH, PATON. HE WAS PRETTY
FAMOUS OVER HERE.

55:48.329 --> 55:49.995
THANK YOU.

55:50.030 --> 55:51.363
YOU'RE WELCOME.

55:59.340 --> 56:00.906
HEY.

56:00.941 --> 56:02.941
OH, HI.

56:02.976 --> 56:04.376
JUST READING.

56:04.412 --> 56:05.877
OH, THE ONE FOR
THE BOOK REPORT?

56:05.913 --> 56:08.214
YEAH. UM, I
HADN'T READ IT.

56:08.249 --> 56:10.115
OH.

56:10.150 --> 56:12.117
TO BE HONEST, I'VE NEVER
EVEN HEARD OF IT BEFORE.

56:12.152 --> 56:13.385
YOU'RE KIDDING?

56:13.421 --> 56:15.187
A BOOK ABOUT YOUR OWN COUNTRY,

56:15.223 --> 56:17.789
WRITTEN BY ONE OF YOUR
MOST FAMOUS AUTHORS?

56:17.825 --> 56:20.459
WELL, HE MIGHT BE
FAMOUS HERE, BUT NOT
IN SOUTH AFRICA.

56:20.494 --> 56:21.627
IT'S PROBABLY BANNED.

56:21.662 --> 56:22.861
BANNED?

56:22.896 --> 56:26.031
YEAH. THERE'S CERTAIN
BOOKS, MOVIES, PEOPLE,

56:26.066 --> 56:28.033
EVEN TV SHOWS THAT WE'RE
NOT ALLOWED TO SEE.

56:28.068 --> 56:29.501
WHO, THE KIDS?

56:29.537 --> 56:31.270
NO. EVERYONE.

56:31.305 --> 56:33.071
WELL, WHO'S
STOPPING YOU?

56:33.107 --> 56:34.707
THE GOVERNMENT.

56:34.742 --> 56:35.974
WHY?

56:36.009 --> 56:37.809
TO PROTECT US.

56:37.845 --> 56:39.745
FROM WHAT?

56:39.780 --> 56:42.748
I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S
JUST THE WAY IT IS.

56:43.718 --> 56:45.050
WEIRD.

56:45.085 --> 56:46.619
HEY, "FREAKY FRIDAY"
IS PLAYING

56:46.654 --> 56:47.620
AT THE MOVIES
THIS WEEKEND.

56:47.655 --> 56:48.320
YOU WANNA GO?

56:48.356 --> 56:50.088
MOVIES.

56:50.124 --> 56:52.190
OH, YEAH. I KEEP
FORGETTING.

56:52.226 --> 56:55.361
SEE, UM, WE CALL MOVIES
BIOSCOPES AND CINEMAS

56:55.396 --> 56:56.595
IN SOUTH AFRICA.

56:56.631 --> 57:01.066
BIOSCOPES? OK, THAT'S
REALLY, REALLY WEIRD.

57:01.101 --> 57:02.735
WELL, SURE. I'D
LOVE TO COME.

57:02.770 --> 57:04.069
GREAT.

57:09.810 --> 57:11.243
I'M GLAD YOU STAYED.

57:11.945 --> 57:13.879
I'M GLAD I STAYED TOO.

57:22.523 --> 57:25.457
[ Rock Music Playing ]

58:49.176 --> 58:50.576
MAYBE I CAN
TEACH YOU.

58:50.611 --> 58:52.544
TENNIS? I DON'T KNOW?

58:52.580 --> 58:54.312
OH, COME ON.
IT'LL BE FUN.

58:54.348 --> 58:57.750
WELL, AS LONG AS I DON'T
HAVE TO WEAR THOSE
LITTLE DOLLY SKIRTS.

58:57.785 --> 59:00.018
IF I HAVE TO WEAR
ONE, YOU HAVE TO
WEAR ONE.

59:01.555 --> 59:02.788
HEY, I WONDER
WHO THAT IS?

59:17.505 --> 59:18.737
HI.

59:20.073 --> 59:21.840
WHAT'S GOING ON?

59:21.876 --> 59:24.777
MAHREE, PIPER, THESE
ARE THE HOFMEYRS.

59:24.812 --> 59:26.578
THEY'RE FROM THE SOUTH
AFRICAN EMBASSY.

59:26.614 --> 59:28.747
THEY'D LIKE TO
SPEAK WITH MAHREE.

59:28.783 --> 59:32.751
IN PRIVATE... IF THAT'S OK.

59:40.360 --> 59:41.760
HOW DID THEY TREAT YOU?

59:41.796 --> 59:42.928
WHO?

59:42.963 --> 59:44.696
THE FAMILY, CHILD.
THE DELLUMS.

59:44.732 --> 59:46.131
FINE. THEY'RE
TREATING ME FINE.

59:46.166 --> 59:47.399
WHAT'S GOING ON?

59:47.435 --> 59:49.134
YOU'RE LEAVING.

59:49.169 --> 59:50.803
WHAT?

59:50.838 --> 59:52.805
GATHER YOUR THINGS.

59:52.840 --> 59:54.139
BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO!

59:54.174 --> 59:56.174
YOU ARE A MINOR,
YOUNG LADY.

59:56.209 --> 59:58.043
AND AS SUCH, YOU
HAVE NO AUTHORITY

59:58.078 --> 59:59.845
TO MAKE THAT DECISION.

59:59.880 --> 01:00:01.613
DO MY PARENTS
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

01:00:03.551 --> 01:00:08.019
WE WILL NOTIFY THEM WHEN
WE GET TO THE EMBASSY.

01:00:08.055 --> 01:00:11.590
PACK YOUR THINGS. YOU
WON'T BE COMING BACK.

01:00:20.968 --> 01:00:21.967
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:00:22.002 --> 01:00:23.368
I'VE GOT TO GO.

01:00:24.404 --> 01:00:26.171
PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT
WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:27.873
IS FOR THE SAFETY
OF THE CHILD.

01:00:27.908 --> 01:00:29.240
WHAT SAFETY?

01:00:29.276 --> 01:00:32.811
WE HAVE NO MORE CONTROL OVER
EVENTS IN OUR COUNTRY,

01:00:32.847 --> 01:00:34.480
THAN YOU HAVE OVER
EVENTS IN YOURS.

01:00:34.515 --> 01:00:36.348
JUST WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:39.217
WE APPRECIATE
YOUR COOPERATION.

01:00:40.521 --> 01:00:41.687
HEY, MOM?

01:00:41.722 --> 01:00:43.722
NO. IT'S ALL RIGHT,
PIPER. IT'S OK, HONEY.

01:00:45.292 --> 01:00:46.625
I'M CALLING DAD.

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:10.415
HE'S BEEN IN EMERGENCY
MEETINGS ALL MORNING.

01:01:10.450 --> 01:01:13.051
HOW CAN THEY JUST
TAKE HER LIKE THAT?!

01:01:16.289 --> 01:01:21.693
STOP APARTHEID NOW!
STOP APARTHEID NOW!

01:01:21.729 --> 01:01:24.129
STOP APARTHEID NOW!

01:01:24.164 --> 01:01:26.498
STOP APARTHEID NOW!

01:01:29.637 --> 01:01:31.570
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:32.871
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

01:01:32.907 --> 01:01:34.907
IT'S A RIOT. DON'T
LOOK AT THEM.

01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:39.144
STOP APARTHEID NOW!

01:01:39.179 --> 01:01:41.413
WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?

01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:42.147
SHHHHH!

01:01:49.590 --> 01:01:50.589
COME WITH ME.

01:01:51.759 --> 01:01:54.225
AMANDA, THIS IS MAHREE BOK.

01:01:54.261 --> 01:01:56.161
HER PARENTS MUST
BE CALLED AND
ARRANGEMENTS MADE

01:01:56.196 --> 01:01:57.596
TO SEND HER HOME
IMMEDIATELY.

01:01:57.631 --> 01:01:59.932
MAHREE, THIS
IS AMANDA, MY
SECRETARY.

01:01:59.967 --> 01:02:01.232
SHE'LL LOOK
AFTER YOU.

01:02:04.772 --> 01:02:06.638
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN GET YOU, MAHREE?

01:02:06.674 --> 01:02:09.441
NO. BUT YOU COULD TELL
ME WHAT'S GOING ON.

01:02:09.476 --> 01:02:11.610
THE FOOL HAS JUST UP
AND KILLED HIMSELF.

01:02:11.645 --> 01:02:12.611
WHO?

01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:14.780
BIKO, THE TERRORIST.

01:02:14.815 --> 01:02:15.948
HE'S KILLED HIMSELF

01:02:15.983 --> 01:02:17.849
AND THE AMERICANS HAVE
GONE DAFT OVER IT.

01:02:17.885 --> 01:02:19.718
THEY'VE BEEN OUT
THERE ALL DAY.

01:02:19.753 --> 01:02:21.853
WHY WOULD HE
KILL HIMSELF?

01:02:21.889 --> 01:02:23.555
WHO KNOWS HOW THEY THINK?

01:02:23.591 --> 01:02:25.657
MAYBE HE FASHIONED
HIMSELF A MARTYR?

01:02:27.061 --> 01:02:31.096
THE FACT IS, HE'S DEAD AND
THE WORLD IS CARRYING ON

01:02:31.131 --> 01:02:32.831
AS THOUGH WE'RE RESPONSIBLE.

01:02:32.866 --> 01:02:35.934
THAT'S WHY WE THOUGHT
WE'D BEST GET YOU
OUT OF THAT HOUSE.

01:02:35.970 --> 01:02:38.103
THERE'S NO TELLING
HOW THEY'D REACT.

01:02:39.073 --> 01:02:40.138
WHO'S THEY?

01:02:40.173 --> 01:02:42.608
THOSE PEOPLE YOU
WERE STAYING WITH.

01:02:42.643 --> 01:02:44.943
WHAT PEOPLE? YOU
MEAN THE DELLUMS?

01:02:44.979 --> 01:02:47.613
WELL, IF NOT THEM, THEN MAYBE
SOME OF THEIR NEIGHBORS.

01:02:47.648 --> 01:02:49.547
IS THAT WHY YOU MADE ME LEAVE?

01:02:49.583 --> 01:02:53.318
YOU AND ABOUT A HALF
DOZEN OTHER MINORS HERE
ON STUDENT VISAS.

01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:55.587
I SHOULD THINK YOU'D BE
GLAD TO GET AWAY FROM THAT.

01:02:55.623 --> 01:02:57.255
GET AWAY FROM WHAT?!

01:02:57.290 --> 01:03:00.626
IT'S OK. YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
WHEN YOU GET OLDER.

01:03:00.661 --> 01:03:02.961
I UNDERSTAND NOW!
THIS IS STUPID!

01:03:02.997 --> 01:03:05.097
SOME GUY KILLS HIMSELF
HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD

01:03:05.132 --> 01:03:06.431
AND YOU THINK I'M IN DANGER?!

01:03:06.466 --> 01:03:09.400
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
WHEN YOU GET OLDER.

01:03:09.436 --> 01:03:12.203
YOU'LL BE STAYING HERE UNTIL
WE CAN CONTACT YOUR FOLKS

01:03:12.239 --> 01:03:13.872
AND GET YOU ON
A PLANE HOME.

01:03:25.252 --> 01:03:26.885
IT'S OFFICIAL.

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:31.023
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL
JUST CONFIRMED THAT BIKO
DIDN'T KILL HIMSELF.

01:03:31.058 --> 01:03:35.627
HE DIED FROM INJURIES
FROM BEING BEATEN...
BY THE POLICE.

01:03:35.663 --> 01:03:37.095
IS IT DOCUMENTED?

01:03:37.131 --> 01:03:38.864
BY SOUTH AFRICAN
NEWS ORGANIZATIONS.

01:03:38.899 --> 01:03:40.032
LET'S SEE THEIR GOVERNMENT

CAN YOU TELL HER
I'LL CALL HER BACK?

01:04:19.472 --> 01:04:21.506
SHE'S BEEN CALLING ALL
DAY. SHE SOUNDS UPSET.

01:04:21.541 --> 01:04:22.574

01:04:25.979 --> 01:04:29.781

THEY MADE MAHREE
LEAVE WITH THEM!

01:04:42.395 --> 01:04:46.364
AH... OK. SWEETHEART, CALM DOWN.

01:04:46.399 --> 01:04:47.699
YEAH.

01:04:47.735 --> 01:04:49.000
LET ME TALK WITH YOUR MOTHER.

01:05:02.716 --> 01:05:03.849
WHAT'S UP?

01:05:05.786 --> 01:05:07.252
NOTHING.

01:05:07.287 --> 01:05:10.555
I JUST DROPPED OFF SOME STUFF
FOR THE PAN AFRICAN FESTIVAL.

01:05:11.725 --> 01:05:15.093
SO, WHERE'S YOUR FRIEND,
THE SOUTH AFRICAN?

01:05:15.129 --> 01:05:17.829
LATELY, YOU TWO HAVE
BEEN LIKE JOINED AT
THE HIP, HUH?

01:05:18.832 --> 01:05:19.998
SHE'S GONE.

01:05:21.802 --> 01:05:23.268
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

01:05:23.303 --> 01:05:25.804
JUST WONDERING WHAT
TOOK HER SO LONG.

01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:27.438
SO LONG TO DO WHAT?

01:05:27.474 --> 01:05:31.276
LEAVE. MY BROTHER
AND I HAD A BET

01:05:31.311 --> 01:05:33.178
ON HOW LONG SHE WOULD
STAY OVER HERE.

01:05:33.213 --> 01:05:35.914
NEITHER OF US FIGURED SHE
WOULD LAST THIS LONG.

01:05:35.949 --> 01:05:38.183
WELL, YOU AND YOUR
BROTHER ARE WRONG.

01:05:38.218 --> 01:05:39.785
MAHREE DIDN'T LEAVE
ON HER OWN.

01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:41.186
SHE DIDN'T?

01:05:41.221 --> 01:05:42.453
NO. SHE DIDN'T.

01:05:42.489 --> 01:05:43.855
YOU SURE?

01:05:43.891 --> 01:05:46.825
LOOK, DANIEL, I DON'T FEEL
LIKE TALKING RIGHT NOW, OK?

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.360
FINE.

01:05:49.396 --> 01:05:52.397
SOUTH AFRICA MAY HAVE
A LOT OF PROBLEMS

01:05:52.432 --> 01:05:54.032
BUT MAHREE WAS
MY FRIEND.

01:05:54.067 --> 01:05:55.667
YOUR FRIEND, HUH?

01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:57.269
YEAH, MY FRIEND.

01:06:05.412 --> 01:06:08.213
YOU GUYS TALKED
A LOT, RIGHT?

01:06:08.248 --> 01:06:09.681
A LOT.

01:06:09.716 --> 01:06:12.951
IN ALL YOUR TALKING, DID
SHE EVER GET AROUND

01:06:12.986 --> 01:06:15.453
TO INVITING YOU TO
COME STAY WITH HER?

01:06:15.488 --> 01:06:17.222
IT NEVER CAME UP.

01:06:18.292 --> 01:06:19.590
THAT SEEM NATURAL TO YOU?

01:06:19.626 --> 01:06:22.694
TWO NEW FRIENDS FROM DIFFERENT
PARTS OF THE WORLD?

01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:24.696
SHE CAME TO STAY WITH YOU.

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:27.532
IT JUST MAKES SENSE THAT
SHE'D ASK YOU TO COME
STAY WITH HER.

01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:28.666
JUST BECAUSE IT
NEVER CAME UP

01:06:28.702 --> 01:06:30.035
DOESN'T MEAN SHE
WOULDN'T HAVE ASKED.

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:35.040
YOU KNOW WHO
STEVEN BIKO IS...

01:06:35.075 --> 01:06:36.374

KNOW HE'S DEAD.

KILLED... BY THEIR POLICE.

01:06:44.084 --> 01:06:48.586
KILLED FOR TRYING TO MAKE
THINGS BETTER FOR BLACKS.

01:06:50.257 --> 01:06:52.958

THINKS ABOUT THAT?

01:10:30.877 --> 01:10:33.244
SOUTH AFRICA HAS A
SERIOUS IMAGE PROBLEM.

DID HE REALLY WANT
TO MAKE IT WORSE

BY AUTHORIZING THE KIDNAPPING
OF A THIRTEEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL

01:10:37.484 --> 01:10:38.983

ANYONE WHO KNOWS RIGHT
FROM WRONG WOULD CARE.

01:11:36.909 --> 01:11:39.577
AND BIKO DIDN'T KILL HIMSELF.
THE POLICE KILLED HIM.

01:11:40.247 --> 01:11:41.779

01:11:46.085 --> 01:11:48.886
BEAT HIM AND TRIED TO HIDE
IT WHEN HE DIED. PIGS!

01:11:48.921 --> 01:11:50.821

OH, YEAH? THEN WHY
DON'T YOU ASK HIM
HOW BIKO DIED?

01:11:55.195 --> 01:11:56.694
I DON'T HAVE TO ASK HIM.

01:11:56.729 --> 01:11:58.396
THIS BIKO WAS A
COMMON CRIMINAL.

01:11:58.431 --> 01:11:59.864
YOU AMERICANS WOULD
CALL HIM A THUG.

01:11:59.899 --> 01:12:01.132
WELL, WHATEVER YOU
WANT TO CALL HIM,

01:12:01.168 --> 01:12:03.034
HE WAS A MAN FIGHTING
FOR JUSTICE.

01:12:03.069 --> 01:12:04.636
JUST LIKE MY FATHER.

01:12:04.671 --> 01:12:06.337

BIKO'S DAUGHTER--

01:12:06.373 --> 01:12:07.705

YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

YES! YES, AS A MATTER OF
FACT, I DO.

01:12:18.117 --> 01:12:21.186
I HAVE FLORA. FLORA IS MY
FRIEND, MY BEST FRIEND.

01:12:21.221 --> 01:12:22.853
FLORA IS YOUR MAID!

01:12:22.889 --> 01:12:25.122
IF YOU STOPPED PAYING HER, DO
YOU THINK SHE'D STICK AROUND?

01:12:25.158 --> 01:12:28.393
OR MAYBE YOU DON'T EVEN PAY HER!
MAYBE SHE'S YOUR SLAVE!

01:12:28.428 --> 01:12:30.094
YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG!

01:12:30.129 --> 01:12:31.929
AND DON'T SAY THAT
ABOUT FLORA!

01:12:31.964 --> 01:12:33.097
WHO HAS IT
ALL WRONG,

01:12:33.132 --> 01:12:35.066
ME AND THE REST OF
THE WORLD, MAHREE?

01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:37.569
OR YOU AND YOUR
RACIST SOUTH
AFRICAN PEOPLE?!

01:12:38.771 --> 01:12:40.171
WHETHER YOU WANT TO
ADMIT IT OR NOT,

01:12:40.207 --> 01:12:41.639
YOU KNOW
I'M RIGHT.

01:12:41.675 --> 01:12:43.374
WHY ELSE DO YOU THINK
YOUR OWN GOVERNMENT

01:12:43.410 --> 01:12:45.009
WOULD HIDE BOOKS
AND MOVIES

01:12:45.044 --> 01:12:47.011
AND STUPID TV SHOWS
FROM ITS OWN PEOPLE?

01:12:47.046 --> 01:12:49.314
WHAT ARE THEY
SO AFRAID OF?

01:12:49.349 --> 01:12:51.716
AND WHY WERE THEY
SO AFRAID OF YOU
STAYING HERE?

01:12:51.751 --> 01:12:56.020
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT
ME HERE, ALL YOU HAD
TO DO WAS SAY SO.

01:13:05.632 --> 01:13:07.064
[ Door Slams ]

01:13:12.939 --> 01:13:14.405
GIRLS.

01:13:30.757 --> 01:13:34.959
I DIDN'T GO DOWN TO THAT
EMBASSY TO BRING YOU BACK

01:13:34.994 --> 01:13:37.262
FOR YOU TWO TO START
FIGHTING. WHAT HAPPENED?

01:13:41.768 --> 01:13:45.536
PIPER WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO
VISIT ME IN SOUTH AFRICA.

01:13:45.572 --> 01:13:50.207
AND I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO
CHANGE THAT, BUT I CAN'T.

01:13:51.478 --> 01:13:53.278
I CAN'T.

01:14:00.119 --> 01:14:03.020
YOU CAN'T HELP WHAT YOUR
GOVERNMENT DOES, MAHREE.

01:14:04.891 --> 01:14:08.326
IT'S NOT MY GOVERNMENT
THAT WOULDN'T ALLOW IT.

01:14:08.361 --> 01:14:10.595
YOU TALKING ABOUT YOUR
FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS?

01:14:13.433 --> 01:14:16.867
WELL, THEIR ATTITUDE
ABOUT BLACKS

01:14:16.903 --> 01:14:19.236
IS STILL THE FAULT
OF THE GOVERNMENT.

01:14:19.272 --> 01:14:21.639
EVERYONE WAS
RAISED THE SAME,

01:14:21.675 --> 01:14:24.074
AS WERE THEIR
PARENTS BEFORE THEM.

01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:27.011
IT'S A NASTY CYCLE.

01:14:27.046 --> 01:14:29.414
IT HAS TO BE STOPPED.

01:14:30.784 --> 01:14:34.352
HERE IN AMERICA WE HAD TO
LEARN THE EXACT SAME LESSON.

01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:36.987
AND NOW IT'S SOUTH
AFRICA'S TIME...

01:14:38.692 --> 01:14:40.925
STARTING, MAYBE, WITH YOU.

01:14:48.167 --> 01:14:52.737
I TOLD PIPER THAT WHEN
I WAS IN THAT EMBASSY

01:14:52.772 --> 01:14:55.306
I FELT LIKE A PRISONER...

01:14:55.342 --> 01:14:57.709
LOCKED UP AND IGNORED.

01:14:59.512 --> 01:15:01.178
NO ONE WAS LISTENING TO ME.

01:15:04.884 --> 01:15:08.285
IT'S NEVER A GOOD FEELING TO
HAVE NO CONTROL OVER YOUR LIFE.

01:15:11.491 --> 01:15:12.623
NO.

01:15:19.833 --> 01:15:22.700
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF A
WEAVER BIRD, MR. DELLUMS?

01:15:24.504 --> 01:15:27.171
I WAS NEVER VERY
FOND OF ZOOLOGY.

01:15:30.076 --> 01:15:35.546
WELL, IT'S A SMALL,
VERY PRETTY BIRD IN
MY COUNTRY.

01:15:37.316 --> 01:15:40.150
I WAS TOLD A STORY ABOUT
THIS BIRD ONCE, BY A FRIEND.

01:15:43.356 --> 01:15:45.523
A VERY GOOD FRIEND.

01:15:45.558 --> 01:15:50.895
AND SHE TOLD ME HOW IT
LIVES IN THIS HUGE NEST

01:15:52.599 --> 01:15:56.166
FILLED WITH ALL THESE
DIFFERENT FAMILIES.

01:15:56.202 --> 01:15:58.269
AND THEY'RE ALL
DIFFERENT COLORS.

01:15:58.304 --> 01:16:03.274
SOME ARE BLACK, SOME ARE
RED, SOME ARE YELLOW,

01:16:03.309 --> 01:16:06.544
AND THEY ALL HELP EACH
OTHER, AND THEY NEVER FIGHT.

01:16:49.355 --> 01:16:51.155
HI, MR. AND MRS.
DELLUMS.

01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:52.122
HI, DANIEL.

01:16:52.158 --> 01:16:53.357
ONE FOR YOU.

01:16:53.392 --> 01:16:53.991
THANK YOU.

01:16:54.026 --> 01:16:55.159
ONE FOR YOU.

01:16:55.194 --> 01:16:56.828
AND ONE FOR YOU.

01:16:56.863 --> 01:16:58.596
THANK YOU.

01:17:00.032 --> 01:17:02.633
THEY'RE FREEDOM FLAGS FOR
BLACK SOUTH AFRICANS.

01:17:02.669 --> 01:17:04.502
THEY'RE BANNED
BACK HOME.

01:17:08.775 --> 01:17:09.941
HAVE MINE.

01:17:14.313 --> 01:17:15.713
THANK YOU.

01:17:18.651 --> 01:17:21.051
WELL, COME ON OR WE'RE
GOING TO BE LATE.

01:17:28.227 --> 01:17:30.561
FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT,

01:17:30.597 --> 01:17:32.697
ONE OF AMERICA'S
GREATEST PRESIDENTS,

01:17:32.732 --> 01:17:34.899
SAID MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS AGO,

01:17:34.934 --> 01:17:37.735
THAT HE LOOKED
FORWARD TO A WORLD

01:17:37.770 --> 01:17:41.939
FOUNDED ON FOUR ESSENTIAL
HUMAN FREEDOMS:

01:17:41.975 --> 01:17:44.141
THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH,

01:17:44.176 --> 01:17:47.545
THE FREEDOM TO WORSHIP
GOD IN YOUR OWN WAY,

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:52.182
THE FREEDOM FROM WANT AND NEED,

01:17:52.218 --> 01:17:54.652
AND FINALLY,

01:17:54.687 --> 01:17:56.487
TO BE FREE FROM FEAR.

01:17:57.456 --> 01:18:00.525
THESE FREEDOMS
SHOULD BE UNIVERSAL,

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:02.393
BUT THERE ARE PLACES
IN THE WORLD

01:18:02.428 --> 01:18:04.662
WHERE THEY ARE JUST DREAMS

01:18:04.697 --> 01:18:08.766
FOR THE MILLIONS OF
THOSE WHO CRY FOR THEM.

01:18:11.437 --> 01:18:13.303
I HAVE A FRIEND,

01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:16.340
A NEW FRIEND,

01:18:16.375 --> 01:18:17.842
FROM SOUTH AFRICA.

01:18:20.312 --> 01:18:24.481
AND THIS FRIEND RECENTLY
TOLD ME A STORY

01:18:24.517 --> 01:18:28.152
ABOUT A UNIQUE BIRD
FOUND IN HER COUNTRY.

01:18:28.187 --> 01:18:33.057
AND WHAT IS REMARKABLE ABOUT
THIS BIRD IS NOT THAT IT NESTS,

01:18:33.092 --> 01:18:34.592
FOR ALL BIRDS NEST,

01:18:34.627 --> 01:18:38.596
BUT THAT THIS PARTICULAR BIRD
NESTS IN A COMMUNITY OF FAMILIES

01:18:38.631 --> 01:18:42.033
ALL UNRELATED TO EACH OTHER
AND ALL OF DIFFERENT COLORS.

01:18:43.302 --> 01:18:47.805
THIS COMMUNITY OF DIFFERENT
COLORED, UNRELATED BIRDS

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:51.241
LIVE TOGETHER WITH
ONE COMMON GOAL--

01:18:53.546 --> 01:18:56.146
TO CARE FOR EACH OTHER.

01:18:56.182 --> 01:19:00.317
WE ARE A WORLD OF PEOPLE,

01:19:00.352 --> 01:19:03.988
NOT RACES, NOT ETHNIC GROUPS,

01:19:04.023 --> 01:19:06.390
NOT CENSUS DESCRIPTIONS
ON PIECES OF PAPER,

01:19:06.425 --> 01:19:09.226
BUT LIVING, BREATHING
HUMAN BEINGS.

01:19:09.261 --> 01:19:13.330
AND IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT
HUMAN BEINGS HAVE IN COMMON

01:19:13.365 --> 01:19:17.501
IT'S THE DESPERATE
NEED TO BE FREE.

01:19:17.536 --> 01:19:19.236
WE MISS YOU
ALREADY, HONEY.

01:19:19.271 --> 01:19:20.471
I'LL MISS YOU TOO.

01:19:20.506 --> 01:19:21.472
HMMM.

01:19:23.476 --> 01:19:26.978
YOU'RE A TREMENDOUS LITTLE
GIRL. BEST TO YOU.

01:19:27.013 --> 01:19:28.312
THANK YOU.

01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:43.828
ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE GONNA
MISS YOUR PLANE.

01:19:46.165 --> 01:19:47.999
OK, GO ON.

01:19:48.034 --> 01:19:49.133

01:19:49.168 --> 01:19:50.735
BYE.

01:19:52.639 --> 01:19:53.738

01:20:02.649 --> 01:20:03.781
ALRIGHTY.
