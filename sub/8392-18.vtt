- I'M SO SORRY, JOEL.

08:50.630 --> 08:51.619
- THANK YOU.

08:51.660 --> 08:53.901
THAN KS, CAMILLE.

08:53.940 --> 08:58.070
- THIS IS WHAT WE WERE WORRIED
WAS GONNA HAPPEN,

08:58.120 --> 09:00.156
WHAT WE WERE HOPING WOULDN'T.

09:00.190 --> 09:02.078
- YEAH.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.054
- I JUST WANT TO PUT
MY ARMS AROUND HER,

09:04.090 --> 09:06.126
BUT...

09:06.160 --> 09:08.606
YOU KNOW JULIA.

09:08.650 --> 09:11.096
I'M WORRIED THAT
SHE NEEDS HER SPACE.

09:11.130 --> 09:12.927
I--AND SOMETIMES
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

09:12.960 --> 09:15.713
[door creaks]

09:17.410 --> 09:20.652
- YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE
TO DO THIS, YOU KNOW.

09:20.690 --> 09:24.729
GOT IT?

09:26.280 --> 09:27.281
- [chuckles]

09:30.220 --> 09:32.074
I'M OKAY.

09:32.120 --> 09:34.668
- SURE.

09:34.710 --> 09:36.871
- IT'S WEDDING WEEK.
YOU JUST GOTTA KEEP ME BUSY.

09:36.920 --> 09:38.876
- [chuckles]
YEAH, YOU GOT IT.

09:38.920 --> 09:41.912
NO PROBLEM.

09:44.270 --> 09:46.716
- YEAH, I MEAN, 8,000.
WE COULD MAKE IT AN EVEN 10,000.

09:46.750 --> 09:48.308
FOR THE TRAIL LEGACY LEVEL.

09:48.340 --> 09:50.615
THEN WE COULD HAVE
A COMPANY SPONSOR TO MATCH IT.

09:50.650 --> 09:52.277
10,000?

09:52.310 --> 09:53.720
YEP, THINK BIG.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.137
VOTE LITTLE.

09:56.180 --> 09:57.135
WONDERFUL.

09:57.180 --> 10:01.412
YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY.
BYE-BYE.

10:01.460 --> 10:03.041
- KRISTINA, WE NEED TO TALK.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.423
- YES, WE DO.
I JUST GOT YOU $10,000 MORE

10:05.460 --> 10:06.939
FOR THIS CAMPAIGN.

10:06.980 --> 10:09.357
THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD SYSTEM
I'VE COME UP WITH.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.777
- KRISTINA,
WE STILL WORK TOGETHER.

10:11.810 --> 10:15.120
WE'RE 15 FEET AWAY,
AND YOU'RE SENDING ME EMAILS.

10:15.160 --> 10:18.197
- YES, I AM.

10:18.230 --> 10:20.676
BOB, LOOK, I'M JUST GONNA BE
HONEST WITH YOU, OKAY?

10:20.720 --> 10:23.063
I THINK THAT YOU'RE--
YOU'RE A GREAT POLITICIAN,

10:23.100 --> 10:24.681
AND I THINK THAT
WE HAVE A GREAT SHOT

10:24.720 --> 10:25.709
AT WINNING THIS ELECTION.

10:25.760 --> 10:29.651
I DO, BUT...

10:29.690 --> 10:31.658
I DON'T TRUST YOU ANYMORE.

10:31.700 --> 10:33.452
I JUST DON'T, I MEAN,

10:33.490 --> 10:36.038
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED
WITH AMBER IN SACRAMENTO--

10:36.080 --> 10:38.355
AND IT'S REALLY HARD
TO LOOK AT YOU FACE-TO-FACE

10:38.390 --> 10:39.766
EVERY SINGLE DAY, AND--

10:39.810 --> 10:41.732
AND LIE ABOUT IT.
THAT I WILL NOT DO.

10:41.770 --> 10:44.250
I PUT MY LITTLE GIRL IN DAY CARE
TO COME WORK FOR YOU,

10:44.290 --> 10:48.397
AND I LIKE MY JOB,
I REALLY DO, BUT THIS IS--

10:48.440 --> 10:50.670
AMBER'S MY NIECE.

10:50.710 --> 10:52.268
- KRISTINA, WE'VE KNOWN
EACH OTHER FOR A LONG TIME.

10:52.300 --> 10:54.222
YOU KNOW I'M NOT A BAD GUY.

10:54.270 --> 10:56.921
NOW, FORGIVE ME
THAT I'VE DEVELOPED FEELINGS

10:56.960 --> 11:00.475
FOR A CAPABLE, SMART,
BEAUTIFUL, YOUNG WOMAN

11:00.520 --> 11:01.999
WHOM YOU PUT
INTO MY LIFE

11:02.040 --> 11:04.679
BECAUSE YOU TRUSTED HER
AND YOU BELIEVED IN HER.

11:04.730 --> 11:07.790
SO I HOPE YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO ACCEPT THAT AND MOVE ON,

11:07.830 --> 11:10.173
BECAUSE I NEED YOU
ON THIS CAMPAIGN.

11:14.080 --> 11:15.490
THOSE ARE
YOUR FAVORITE MUFFINS

11:15.530 --> 11:19.876
FROM GOLDEN'S BAKERY.

11:19.920 --> 11:22.673
THEY'RE DELICIOUS.

11:25.440 --> 11:26.839
- [sighs]

11:26.890 --> 11:28.403
- SO THEY'RE GEE—ENG MARRIED?

11:28.440 --> 11:30.408
- THAT'S CRAZY.
- YEAH.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.443
- I LOVE THAT.

11:33.480 --> 11:35.232
UH, WHERE ARE
THEY DOING IT?

11:35.280 --> 11:38.033
- UH, AT THE HOUSE
IN THE BACKYARD.

11:38.070 --> 11:39.753
- VERY NICE.
- YEAH.

11:39.800 --> 11:40.869
WILL YOU BE MY DATE?

11:40.900 --> 11:43.869
- YES, PLEASE.
[both chuckle]

11:43.910 --> 11:45.764
I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE COOL TO HAVE,

11:45.800 --> 11:47.040
IF YOU'RE GONNA DO
A LAST-MINUTE WEDDING,

11:47.080 --> 11:48.456
HAVE IT IN IRELAND.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.183
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

11:50.220 --> 11:51.972
- WHY?

11:52.020 --> 11:54.352
- IT'S SO ROMANTIC OUT THERE.

11:54.400 --> 11:57.119
HOME OF THOMAS MOORE
AND VAN MORRISON.

11:57.160 --> 11:59.537
- HOW WOULD YOU GET
EVERYBODY, YOU KNOW, THERE?

11:59.580 --> 12:01.810
LET'S SAY THERE'S A BABY.
IS THERE--THE BABY--

12:01.850 --> 12:02.817
- BABY CAN COME.

12:02.860 --> 12:04.509
STRAP ON THE BACK.
- UH-HUH.

12:04.550 --> 12:06.780
- OR CARRY-ON.
- YEAH.

12:06.820 --> 12:08.299
IT CHANGES, YOU KNOW.

12:08.340 --> 12:11.093
BEING ABLE TO DO SOMETHING
LAST-MINUTE, YOU KNOW?

12:11.140 --> 12:14.894
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT
FOR A WHILE.

12:14.940 --> 12:16.100
- YEAH.
NO, I-I--

12:16.140 --> 12:18.529
- AND IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT I, YOU KNOW,

12:18.560 --> 12:22.553
WON'T GET PREGNANT,
YOU KNOW?

12:22.600 --> 12:25.455
- NO, YOU WILL GET PREGNANT.

12:25.500 --> 12:29.118
LOOK, I WAS SAYING
THAT I THINK

12:29.160 --> 12:32.129
IRELAND IS A COOL,
ROMANTIC PLACE.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.809
BUT WE COULD NTMST GO THERE.

12:33.850 --> 12:36.432
- JUST TAKE OUR BABY
AND GO THERE.

12:36.470 --> 12:39.576
- OKAY.
[chuckles]

12:39.620 --> 12:41.121
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

12:41.170 --> 12:44.298
- OKAY.
[chuckles]

12:47.310 --> 12:48.937
- SO DAD WAS WINNING, RIGHT?

12:48.970 --> 12:50.892
- HE DOESN'T SEEM PLEASED.
- NO, 'CAUSE HE WAS--

12:50.940 --> 12:52.862
- GUYS, WE'RE NOT
GONNA DISCUSS IT, OKAY?

12:52.910 --> 12:54.070
- NO, THEN UNCLE CROSBY
WAS ON TOP OF HIM.

12:54.110 --> 12:56.169
- NEITHER ONE OF THEM WON,
BECAUSE THEY BOTH LOST TRACK

12:56.220 --> 12:58.529
OF THEIR EMOTIONS
AND ACTED LIKE CHILDREN.

12:58.570 --> 12:59.639
- WELL, THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

12:59.670 --> 13:01.399
- THANKS FOR THE HELP.
- BOTH PEOPLE CAN'T LOSE.

13:01.430 --> 13:04.354
STOP--STOP IT!
- YOU STOP FIGHTING.

13:04.400 --> 13:05.492
THAT IS NOT WHAT
WE LEARN HERE, OKAY?

13:05.540 --> 13:07.223
- YES, IT IS.
DAD JUST DID IT.

13:07.260 --> 13:10.400
- GRANDPA!
- HEY, HONEY, HOW YOU DOING?

13:10.440 --> 13:12.055
- SAY, "IT'S ME!"
- GRANDSON.

13:12.100 --> 13:13.431
- I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS
COMING OVER FOR DINNER.

13:13.480 --> 13:14.469
DO YOU WANT SOME DINNER?
- HEY, POP.

13:14.510 --> 13:15.579
- ADAM.
- HOW YOU DOING?

13:15.620 --> 13:17.201
- GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?
- WE'RE GOOD.

13:17.240 --> 13:19.162
WE'RE JUST MAKING
SOME BEEF BOURGUIGNON.

13:19.210 --> 13:20.586
- OOH.
- WE'RE PEACEFUL HERE.

13:20.620 --> 13:21.587
- BEEF BOURGUIGN--WHAT?
- BEEF STEW.

13:21.620 --> 13:23.588
- HEY, ADAM, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

13:23.630 --> 13:25.200
- I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE COMING.

13:25.250 --> 13:27.241
- YEAH.
- I WOULD'VE MADE STEW.

13:27.280 --> 13:31.000
- I'LL FINISH UP.
- [gasp5]

13:31.050 --> 13:33.382
- DOES DAD GET A CONSEQUENCE
FOR FIGHTING WITH UNCLE CROSBY?

13:33.430 --> 13:34.636
'CAUSE I THINK HE SHOULD,
'CAUSE I GOT A CONSEQUENCE

13:34.670 --> 13:36.422
FOR FIGHTING WITH JABBAR.

13:36.470 --> 13:37.425
- [grunts]

13:37.470 --> 13:39.563
- ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO TALK ABOUT?

13:39.610 --> 13:40.531
- WELL, YOUR BROTHER'S
GETTING MARRIED

13:40.570 --> 13:43.221
IN LESS THAN 48 HOURS.
- I'M WELL AWARE.

13:43.270 --> 13:44.988
- I REALLY DON'T WANT
THE TWO OF YOU ARGUING

13:45.030 --> 13:46.406
DURING THE WEEK
HE'S GONNA GET MARRIED.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.328
- WELL, I DON'T EITHER,
BUT IT WAS HIS DECISION

13:48.370 --> 13:50.543
TO ANNOUNCE TO THE ENTIRE FAMILY
THAT I'M NO LONGER HIS BEST MAN.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.400
- WELL, YOU WENT BEHIND HIS BACK
TO MEET WITH THAT GUY.

13:52.450 --> 13:54.270
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS OUR BUSINESS, ALL RIGHT?

13:54.310 --> 13:55.447
YOU DON'T NEED
TO BE INVOLVED.

13:55.480 --> 13:56.686
- ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I AM INVOLVED.

13:56.730 --> 13:59.278
I MEAN, MY GOD, I HAD A WORLD
FEDERATION WRESTLING MATCH

13:59.320 --> 14:00.457
IN MY LIVING ROOM,
FOR PETE'S SAKE.

14:00.490 --> 14:02.344
- WELL, I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- ADAM, ADAM, PLEASE.

14:02.390 --> 14:03.379
LISTEN. JUST LISTEN TO ME!
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:03.420 --> 14:05.422
WE GOT A SIGNIFICANT--
- WOULD YOU LISTEN TO ME

14:05.460 --> 14:07.280
FOR A MINUTE?

14:07.320 --> 14:08.526
I NEED YOU
TO MAKE UP WITH HIM.

14:08.570 --> 14:10.492
WE DON'T WANT
THAT CRAZY BASTARD BILLY--

14:10.530 --> 14:12.259
- YOU GUYS SOUND
LIKE YOU'RE FIGHTING.

14:12.290 --> 14:13.530
- WE'RE NOT FIGHTING.
- IF YOU'RE FIGHTING,

14:13.570 --> 14:14.491
MOM'S GOT SOME SALSA
IN THE KITCHEN.

14:14.540 --> 14:16.565
- WE'RE FINE, MAX.
- NO, IT'S NOT A FIGHT.

14:16.610 --> 14:18.578
HEY, DO YOU HAVE
A NEW PET OR SOMETHING?

14:18.610 --> 14:19.918
- YES, I HAVE
A BEARDED DRAGON.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.268
IT'S UPSTAIRS.
DO YOU WANNA SEE IT?

14:21.300 --> 14:22.267
- YES, I'D LIKE TO SEE
THE BEARDED DRAGON.

14:22.300 --> 14:23.995
- YEAH, YOU SHOULD CHECK IT OUT.
- LET'S GO.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.578
FIX IT, PLEASE.
- GRANDPA, LET'S GO!

14:26.620 --> 14:30.340
YOU WANNA SEE IT,
LET'S SEE IT.

14:43.220 --> 14:45.017
- OH!
[squeals and laughs]

14:45.050 --> 14:46.631
- HAVE I EVER TOLD YOU
HOW MUCH I LOVE

14:46.670 --> 14:48.706
THE WAY YOU LOAD
A DISHWASHER?

14:48.740 --> 14:50.674
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

14:50.710 --> 14:52.530
- 'CAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT HAPPY
WITH IT, I CAN--

14:52.580 --> 14:54.957
I CAN CHANGE IT...
- NO, IT'S PERFECT.

14:54.990 --> 14:56.161
- IF THAT'S BETTER FOR YOU.
- NO, IT'S SO GOOD.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.475
- [giggIeSJ

14:58.510 --> 15:00.330
HEY, I HOPE YOU'RE NOT BUMMED
ABOUT MY MOTHER

15:00.380 --> 15:01.642
DOUBLING THE SIZE
OF THE WEDDING.

15:01.690 --> 15:03.476
UM, I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

15:03.520 --> 15:04.589
- NO, NO, NO.

15:04.620 --> 15:06.030
THE MORE CHURCH FOLKS
AND RELATIVES, THE BETTER.

15:06.070 --> 15:07.139
- YOU SURE?
- YEAH.

15:07.180 --> 15:08.659
- OKAY.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.691
NOW WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU AND YOUR BROTHER?

15:10.730 --> 15:13.073
- YOU MEAN OTHER THAN
THE FISTFIGHT

15:13.110 --> 15:14.737
AND ME REPLACING HIM
AS BEST MAN?

15:14.770 --> 15:16.180
- YEAH.
YEAH, OTHER THAN THAT.

15:16.220 --> 15:17.664
- THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
ALL THE DEVELOPMENTS.

15:17.700 --> 15:18.974
- COME ON, BABE, YOU NEED
TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

15:19.020 --> 15:20.044
YOU CAN'T BE ARGUING
WITH YOUR BROTHER

15:20.090 --> 15:21.045
ON YOUR WEDDING DAY.

15:21.090 --> 15:22.159
- OKAY, WELL,
YOU GO FIX HIM,

15:22.190 --> 15:23.532
AND I'LL STOP
FIGHTING WITH HIM.

15:23.570 --> 15:25.435
THIS IS THE SAME CYCLE
WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN IN,

15:25.470 --> 15:26.539
WHERE HE'S RIGHT
AND I'M WRONG.

15:26.580 --> 15:28.673
NO MATTER WHAT I DO,
HE'S RIGHT.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.369
I MEAN, IT WAS MY IDEA

15:30.410 --> 15:32.128
TO START THE LUNCHEONETTE,
NOT HIS.

15:32.170 --> 15:33.717
I'M THE REASON
THAT WE HAVE THIS THING

15:33.760 --> 15:35.648
THAT'S WORTH MILLIONS, OKAY,
NOT HIM.

15:35.690 --> 15:38.511
YET SOMEHOW, HE STILL DOESN'T
SEE ME AS HIS EQUAL.

15:38.550 --> 15:40.689
- BABY, YOU ARE TAKING THIS
WAY TOO PERSONAL.

15:40.730 --> 15:42.755
IT'S NOT PERSONAL.
IT'S BUSINESS.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.620
YOUR BROTHER WANTS TO BE
IN ABUSINESS,

15:44.660 --> 15:45.581
AND YOU WANT TO BE
IN THISBUSINESS.

15:45.630 --> 15:49.669
AND MAYBE IT'S NOT
THE SAME THING, BUT...

15:49.700 --> 15:51.110
IT'S NOT PERSONAL.

15:51.150 --> 15:55.154
HE'S STILL YOUR BROTHER.

16:08.380 --> 16:10.405
- WHAT?

16:13.040 --> 16:16.419
- I THINK I'M READY.

16:16.450 --> 16:19.726
- Y-YEAH, ME--
ME TOO.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.479
SHOULD I GET, LIKE...

16:22.530 --> 16:24.418
- YES.
- STUFF? OKAY.

16:27.430 --> 16:29.534
[doorbell rings]

16:29.570 --> 16:30.730
- MEET UP
ON THE WEEKEND OR--

16:30.780 --> 16:33.328
- WHO IS THAT?

16:35.820 --> 16:37.196
- [sighs]

16:37.230 --> 16:39.539
- NO.

16:39.580 --> 16:40.740
MAKE HER WAIT.

16:40.790 --> 16:43.645
- HONEY, I'M NOT GONNA--

16:43.690 --> 16:46.341
JULIA, JUST--JUST--
HONEY, COME ON.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.792
- NO, PHIL,
I NEED TO TALK TO HER.

16:48.830 --> 16:52.414
ZOE.

16:55.350 --> 16:58.763
- IS THAT YOUR MOM?

16:58.810 --> 17:00.425
- YEAH.

17:00.460 --> 17:02.428
- THAT'S GOOD.

17:02.460 --> 17:04.667
SHE'S HELPING.

17:04.710 --> 17:06.109
TROY?

17:06.160 --> 17:08.151
- NO TROY.

17:08.190 --> 17:11.603
- GOOD.

17:13.510 --> 17:16.502
- I DIDN'T KNOW.
_ UM--

17:17.820 --> 17:20.129
- [crying] I--I SWEAR TO YOU
I DIDN'T KNOW

17:20.170 --> 17:23.059
UNTIL HE WAS BORN.

17:23.110 --> 17:25.681
AND I'M SO SORRY.

17:25.730 --> 17:28.767
- I DON'T KNOW
- HOW IS HE?

17:28.800 --> 17:31.360
- HOW DEEP
- HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

17:34.530 --> 17:37.465
- THE WELL RUNS

17:37.500 --> 17:38.489
- JULIA...

17:38.540 --> 17:42.328
- IN MY HEART
