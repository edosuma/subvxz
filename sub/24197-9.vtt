09:47.433 --> 09:47.667
MYSTERY?

09:47.667 --> 09:49.400
>> YES, IN FACT, I THOUGHT OF

09:49.400 --> 09:50.667
THAT LATER.

09:50.667 --> 09:53.200
COULD I PLAY WITH THAT IDEA

09:53.200 --> 09:53.567
SOMEHOW.

09:53.567 --> 09:55.933
NEVER DID REALLY PLAY WITH IT,

09:55.933 --> 09:57.533
BUT, YEAH, MYSTERY.

09:57.533 --> 09:57.933
YES.

09:57.933 --> 09:59.767
>> HOW LONG HAVE YOU LIVED IN AN

09:59.767 --> 10:00.067
RV?

10:00.067 --> 10:01.200
>> ACTUALLY, JUST FIVE YEARS.

10:01.200 --> 10:01.567
>> OKAY.

10:01.567 --> 10:01.967
TEMPORARY.

10:01.967 --> 10:05.000
>> YES.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.867
>> WHEN YOU'RE A SUBSTITUTE

10:08.867 --> 10:09.633
TEACHER, DO YOU TRY TO ACTUALLY

10:09.633 --> 10:11.933
TEACH THAT DAY OR DO YOU JUST

10:11.933 --> 10:12.633
TRY TO GET THROUGH THE CLASS

10:12.633 --> 10:13.300
WITHOUT ANYTHING HORRIBLE

10:13.300 --> 10:20.267
HAPPENING?

10:20.267 --> 10:23.600
NO COMMENT?

10:23.600 --> 10:24.067
OKAY.

10:24.067 --> 10:25.767
>> DO YOU EVER GET LEG CRAMPS

10:25.767 --> 10:26.800
WHILE YOU'RE IN BED.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.500
YOU TRY TO MASSAGE THEM OUT.

10:28.500 --> 10:29.633
THEY'RE SO PAINFUL.

10:29.633 --> 10:31.567
>> HOW OFTEN ARE YOU CRAMPING IN

10:31.567 --> 10:32.233
BED?

10:32.233 --> 10:33.567
IS IT BECAUSE YOU'RE SLEEPING

10:33.567 --> 10:34.500
INSIDE AN RV?

10:34.500 --> 10:35.700
>> NO, I DON'T THINK IT'S

10:35.700 --> 10:37.900
BECAUSE I'M IN AN RV, MAYBE IT

10:37.900 --> 10:39.700
WOULD BE -- IT SEEMS LIKE THINGS

10:39.700 --> 10:42.533
DRY A LOT FASTER INSIDE THE RV.

10:42.533 --> 10:44.167
>> DO YOUR VIDEOS COME FROM A

10:44.167 --> 10:45.967
PLACE OF TRYING TO SAVE MONEY?

10:45.967 --> 10:47.567
>> IT'S JUST A MATTER OF RUNNING

10:47.567 --> 10:49.467
INTO IT, LIKE SOMETHING THAT WAS

10:49.467 --> 10:51.167
-- THAT I NEEDED AT THAT POINT

10:51.167 --> 10:52.133
IN TIME.

10:52.133 --> 10:55.933
LIKE TURNING BREAD CRUMBS BACK

10:55.933 --> 10:56.367
INTO BREAD.

10:56.367 --> 10:59.033
>> ALL YOU NEED IS BREAD CRUMBS,

10:59.033 --> 11:00.967
ONE EGG AND A MOLD.

11:00.967 --> 11:03.833
>> MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T

11:03.833 --> 11:04.567
HAVE ANY NEED FOR THAT, BUT I

11:04.567 --> 11:06.200
FELT LIKE I NEEDED TO.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.300
EVEN LOOKING INTO THAT DISEASE

11:07.300 --> 11:09.200
THAT YOU GET FROM BREAD.

11:09.200 --> 11:09.633
>> GLUTEN?

11:09.633 --> 11:12.333
>> YOU CAN GET GLUTEN-FREE BREAD

11:12.333 --> 11:13.733
CRUMBS AND MAKE BISCUITS OUT OF

11:13.733 --> 11:16.167
THEM INSTEAD OF HAVING TO BUY

11:16.167 --> 11:16.700
THE $5 --

11:16.700 --> 11:18.867
>> THAT'S WHERE THAT DISEASE

11:18.867 --> 11:19.267
GETS YOU.

11:19.267 --> 11:19.633
>> YEAH.

11:19.633 --> 11:20.333
>> IT'S AN EXPENSIVE PERSON

11:20.333 --> 11:22.300
DISEASE.

11:22.300 --> 11:22.867
>> YEAH.

11:22.867 --> 11:25.167
>> A LOT OF YOUR VIDEOS ARE

11:25.167 --> 11:25.667
ABOUT FOOD.

11:25.667 --> 11:28.067
>> HOW MANY OF YOU LIKE TO EAT

11:28.067 --> 11:29.633
CAKE BUT FIND IT HARD TO MAKE

11:29.633 --> 11:29.933
ONE?

11:29.933 --> 11:32.467
>> HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED

11:32.467 --> 11:33.733
MAKING A COOKBOOK?

11:33.733 --> 11:34.800
>> MAYBE SLIGHTLY.

11:34.800 --> 11:37.433
I JUST -- I KNOW TASTE.

11:37.433 --> 11:39.600
I CAN ACTUALLY GO TO A CANDY

11:39.600 --> 11:43.267
MACHINE AND I CAN TASTE EVERY

11:43.267 --> 11:44.600
CANDY AND EVERY CHIP THAT THERE

11:44.600 --> 11:46.933
IS IN THERE, JUST IN MY MIND.

11:46.933 --> 11:47.600
>> OKAY.

11:47.600 --> 11:50.067
LET'S JUST TEST YOU RIGHT NOW.

11:50.067 --> 11:50.767
I'M GOING TO SAY A CANDY AND YOU

11:50.767 --> 11:52.267
TELL ME IF YOU CAN TASTE IT.

11:52.267 --> 11:56.533
JUNIOR MINTS.

11:56.533 --> 11:58.667
>> YES.

11:58.667 --> 12:03.767
>> SOUR PATCH KIDS.

12:03.767 --> 12:04.300
>> I THINK I CAN TASTE IT.

12:04.300 --> 12:07.067
>> OKAY.

12:07.067 --> 12:14.433
A THREE MUSKATEER?

12:14.433 --> 12:15.067
>> YES.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.433
>> REESE'S PEANUT BUTTER CUPS.

12:17.433 --> 12:18.467
>> THAT ONE WAS FAST.

12:18.467 --> 12:19.600
>> YES, BECAUSE I LOVE THEM.

12:19.600 --> 12:20.233
>> OKAY.

12:20.233 --> 12:23.333
THIS WILL BE A HARD ONE.

12:23.333 --> 12:30.900
DARK CHOCOLATE.

12:30.900 --> 12:31.200
78%

12:31.200 --> 12:31.800
78% CACAO.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.667
>> I'M PROBABLY UNABLE TO

12:33.667 --> 12:35.067
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN LIGHTER

12:35.067 --> 12:36.300
CHOCOLATE VERSUS LIGHTER

12:36.300 --> 12:36.700
CHOCOLATE.

12:36.700 --> 12:38.200
YET I LIKE DARK CHOCOLATE AND I

12:38.200 --> 12:39.333
DO EAT IT.

12:39.333 --> 12:39.700
>> OKAY.

12:39.700 --> 12:42.933
>> IN FACT, JUST AS I SAID THAT

12:42.933 --> 12:43.200
--

12:43.200 --> 12:44.567
>> IT HIT YOU.

12:44.567 --> 12:44.967
>> YEAH.

12:44.967 --> 12:46.867
>> BASICALLY YOU CAN DO IT ALL.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.833
YOU SAY IN A LOT OF YOUR VIDEOS

12:48.833 --> 12:50.767
THAT YOU DON'T LIKE THE TASTE OF

12:50.767 --> 12:51.267
POTATO SALAD.

12:51.267 --> 12:53.800
>> HEY, IF YOU'RE LIKE ME, YOU

12:53.800 --> 12:55.167
DON'T LIKE POTATO SALAD.

12:55.167 --> 12:57.067
>> YET, YOU'RE ALWAYS BUYING

12:57.067 --> 12:57.467
POTATO SALAD.

12:57.467 --> 12:59.700
>> I KEEP IT AROUND AS A SNACK.

12:59.700 --> 13:01.467
I DON'T HAVE THIS APPRECIATION

13:01.467 --> 13:02.067
FOR POTATO SALAD.

13:02.067 --> 13:06.067
>> THEN DON'T BUY IT.

13:06.067 --> 13:08.133
>> IT WORKS AS GOOD AS A

13:08.133 --> 13:08.600
MUNCHING FOOD.

13:08.600 --> 13:09.233
>> A SIDE?

13:09.233 --> 13:11.833
>> THAT'S MOSTLY THE WAY I USE

13:11.833 --> 13:12.133
IT.

13:12.133 --> 13:12.500
>> SURE.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.267
YOUR TRICK TO KICK IT UP A NOTCH

13:14.267 --> 13:16.233
IS TO PUT PICKLE JUICE IN IT.

13:16.233 --> 13:16.633
>> RIGHT.

13:16.633 --> 13:19.133
>> DO YOU KNOW HOW I KICK UP MY

13:19.133 --> 13:19.500
PICKLES?

13:19.500 --> 13:20.667
>> HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

13:20.667 --> 13:22.700
>> I PUT POTATO SALAD IN THEM.

13:22.700 --> 13:25.333
I WATCHED THE FRUIT SMOOTHIE

13:25.333 --> 13:25.533
VIDEO.

13:25.533 --> 13:27.067
FIRST QUESTION, WHEN WAS THE

13:27.067 --> 13:28.633
LAST TIME YOU CLEANED YOUR

13:28.633 --> 13:28.900
STRAINER?

13:28.900 --> 13:32.067
SHE LOOKED A LITTLE GUNKED UP.

13:32.067 --> 13:34.200
SECOND, HAVE YOU CALCULATED THE

13:34.200 --> 13:36.433
NUMBER OF CALORIES IN THAT

13:36.433 --> 13:36.967
MONSTER?

13:36.967 --> 13:37.300
>> NO.

13:37.300 --> 13:39.433
>> YOU'RE USING A WHOLE CREAMER.

13:39.433 --> 13:41.500
THAT'S 2,300 CALORIES.

13:41.500 --> 13:43.067
>> I WOULD PROBABLY SAY IF

13:43.067 --> 13:44.700
YOU'RE HEALTH CONSCIOUS, DON'T

13:44.700 --> 13:45.067
DO THIS.

13:45.067 --> 13:47.100
>> YOU SHOULD BE MORBIDLY OBESE.

13:47.100 --> 13:48.733
>> I DON'T DRINK IT VERY OFTEN.

13:48.733 --> 13:51.167
IN FACT, FRUIT I STAY AWAY FROM

13:51.167 --> 13:52.767
BECAUSE I HAVE DIABETES AND IT

13:52.767 --> 13:54.733
SEEMS TO BRING UP MY SUGAR ALL

13:54.733 --> 13:55.167
THE TIME.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.633
>> YOU THINK THE FRUIT'S

13:56.633 --> 13:58.600
BRINGING UP YOUR SUGAR?

13:58.600 --> 14:00.067
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH YOU FILMING

14:00.067 --> 14:02.367
DEAD ANIMALS ON YOUR CHANNEL?

14:02.367 --> 14:04.200
WAS THAT JUST A COINCIDENCE, YOU

14:04.200 --> 14:05.200
HAPPENED UPON THEM?

14:05.200 --> 14:06.067
>> YEAH.

14:06.067 --> 14:09.167
I THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER A DEAD

14:09.167 --> 14:09.800
ANIMAL WOULD BE APPRECIATED BY

14:09.800 --> 14:10.233
THE VIEWERS.

14:10.233 --> 14:11.367
IT BEING A RANCH, YOU'RE GOING

14:11.367 --> 14:12.467
TO SEE STUFF LIKE THAT.

14:12.467 --> 14:12.833
>> YEAH.

14:12.833 --> 14:15.200
>> I GOT THEM A TASTE OF WHAT

14:15.200 --> 14:17.067
RANCH LIFE WAS LIKE.

14:17.067 --> 14:18.400
>> THAT'S NOT MY CUP OF TEA.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.767
I'M STILL NOT SURE I CAN RELATE

14:19.767 --> 14:21.200
TO YOU, BUT LET'S HUG AND CRY

14:21.200 --> 14:25.833
ANYWAY.

14:25.833 --> 14:27.233
NO MAKEOVER'S COMPLETE WITHOUT

14:27.233 --> 14:29.233
REMOVING YOUR GLASSES.

14:29.233 --> 14:32.233
SAY GOOD-BYE TO THE SAD GRANDPA

14:32.233 --> 14:32.433
VIBE.

14:32.433 --> 14:34.800
YOUR EYES ARE SO BEAUTIFUL, I

14:34.800 --> 14:35.533
THINK WE SHOULD JUST FOCUS ON

14:35.533 --> 14:39.067
ONE OF THEM.

14:39.067 --> 14:39.467
HMM?

14:39.467 --> 14:40.600
NOW YOU LOOK MYSTERIOUS AND

14:40.600 --> 14:43.600
INFECTED.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.767
YOUR HAIR IS YOUR STRONGEST

14:45.767 --> 14:45.967
ASSET.

14:45.967 --> 14:48.900
IT JUST NEEDS A LITTLE PRODUCT.

14:48.900 --> 14:51.067
WHIPPED CREAM WORKS JUST AS GOOD

14:51.067 --> 14:52.400
AS ANY POMADE.

14:52.400 --> 14:53.600
AND IF IT MELTS, YOU GOT

14:53.600 --> 14:57.767
YOURSELF A LITTLE SNACK.

14:57.767 --> 15:03.133
PERFECT.

15:03.133 --> 15:05.633
THE WAY YOU DRESS SAYS A LOT

15:05.633 --> 15:06.067
ABOUT YOU.

15:06.067 --> 15:07.433
THAT'S WHY I PICKED THIS SHIRT.

15:07.433 --> 15:08.800
IT SENDS A CLEAR MESSAGE.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.300
IF YOU LIKE THE WAY YOU LOOK,

15:10.300 --> 15:11.800
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE WHAT I DO

15:11.800 --> 15:13.167
TO YOUR CAR HOME.

15:13.167 --> 15:17.067
*

15:17.067 --> 15:20.867
>> OH!

15:20.867 --> 15:22.733
HE'S STILL WEARING THE CLOTHES

15:22.733 --> 15:24.067
WE GOT HIM.

15:24.067 --> 15:25.400
THOSE RENOVATION SHOWS MAKE IT

15:25.400 --> 15:26.133
LOOK SO EASY.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.467
I WAS A FOOL TO THINK THIS IS A

15:28.467 --> 15:29.167
ONE-MAN JOB.

15:29.167 --> 15:30.600
I BLEW OUT THE PASSENGER SIDE

15:30.600 --> 15:32.133
WALL TO BRING IN SOME MORE

15:32.133 --> 15:32.933
NATURAL LIGHT.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.300
WE PUT IN FOR THE PERFECT, BUT

15:34.300 --> 15:36.333
IT'S GOING TO TAKE AT LEAST SIX

15:36.333 --> 15:37.367
TO 18 MORE MONTHS.

15:37.367 --> 15:39.100
>> THAT'S A GREAT BREAKFAST

15:39.100 --> 15:39.433
SALAD.

15:39.433 --> 15:40.900
>> PROBABLY BEST WE JUST LEAVE

15:40.900 --> 15:42.200
THOSE CAMERAS IN THERE SO THE

15:42.200 --> 15:44.433
GOVERNMENT CAN CHECK IN ON HIM.

15:44.433 --> 15:46.967
>>> IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING,

15:46.967 --> 15:49.067
HERE IS THE RECIPE FOR BREAKFAST

15:49.067 --> 15:49.400
SALAD.

15:49.400 --> 15:50.167
CROUTONS AND RANCH.

15:50.167 --> 15:52.067
HE CHANGED ME JUST AS MUCH AS I

15:52.067 --> 15:52.867
DIDN'T CHANGE HIM.

15:52.867 --> 15:55.200
WE'LL BE BACK, BUT FIRST, THERE

15:55.200 --> 15:57.467
IS NOTHING SEXIER THAN A WOMAN

15:57.467 --> 16:02.333
SLOWLY DESCENDING A STAIRCASE.

16:09.800 --> 16:19.233
*

16:19.233 --> 16:33.800

16:33.800 --> 16:36.167

16:36.167 --> 16:37.767
PRIEST AND THAT'S WHEN THEY'RE

16:37.767 --> 16:40.533
AT THEIR HORNIEST.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.167
FOR SOME REASON PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

16:42.167 --> 16:44.700
FILMING THEMSELVES SINGING THE

16:44.700 --> 16:46.633
HALO THEME SONG IN PLACES WITH

16:46.633 --> 16:47.867
GREAT ACOUSTICS.

16:47.867 --> 16:49.367
BUT UNFORTUNATELY MY PARENTS

16:49.367 --> 16:51.767
WON'T LET ME PLAY VIOLENT VIDEO

16:51.767 --> 16:52.333
GAMES.

16:52.333 --> 16:54.733
SO MY TUNES ARE RATED "E" FOR

16:54.733 --> 16:58.833
EVERYONE.

*

17:00.367 --> 17:04.933

17:04.933 --> 17:07.433

TO ENTER THEIR INITIALS ON OUR

17:08.300 --> 17:13.200
WEBSITE.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.833

CLASSICALLY TRAINED VOCALIST?
