He said that?

47:23.460 --> 47:28.370
You should consider
edging Glen out.

47:28.470 --> 47:31.911
- I should consider?
- It's your band!

47:33.180 --> 47:35.652
- Yeah, but, I mean...
- Oh, come on, my boy,

47:35.752 --> 47:39.960
you have to do what is right
for the band.

47:41.631 --> 47:44.302
Make me proud!

47:54.322 --> 47:56.326
- You OK?
- Yeah.

47:57.996 --> 48:00.067
What are you having?

48:00.167 --> 48:02.004
[Woman]
I was so disappointed.

48:02.104 --> 48:03.674
Uh...

48:05.411 --> 48:08.283
I'll just, uh...
I'll be with you in a sec.

48:08.383 --> 48:10.487
[Indistinct,
excited chattering]

48:13.995 --> 48:15.130
Oi!

48:15.230 --> 48:17.134
- Hello, Huddersfields.
- Hi.

48:17.234 --> 48:19.038
- I thought I recognised you.
- From the crowd?

48:19.138 --> 48:22.178
I could hear you both screaming
from the stage.

48:22.278 --> 48:24.583
- Be honest, what did you think?
- It was amazing.

48:24.683 --> 48:26.019
- Did you think?
- Yeah.

48:26.119 --> 48:28.624
- Best thing ever!
- Where are you going?

48:28.724 --> 48:30.360
Oh, well,
we met some people,

48:30.460 --> 48:32.364
and they said we could sleep
on their floor.

48:32.464 --> 48:34.703
- Oh! On their floor?
- Mm-hmm.

48:34.803 --> 48:37.509
I can do better than that.
Look, if...

48:37.609 --> 48:39.613
Oi, oi! [Whistles]

48:42.385 --> 48:44.623
You're both welcome.
There's plenty of room.

48:44.723 --> 48:47.194
I mean, I don't know...

48:47.294 --> 48:50.568
- So... I wouldn't mind.
- Yeah?

48:50.668 --> 48:53.641
- [Francie] All right, then.
- [Steve] All right, then.

48:53.741 --> 48:55.612
So, what was
your favourite tune?

48:55.712 --> 48:58.250
My favourite one would be
"Pretty Vacant".

48:58.350 --> 49:01.524
It's not far from...
Uh... Jordan!

49:01.624 --> 49:03.126
- We..
- I'm taking care of them.

49:03.226 --> 49:04.663
It's all right,
I'm taking care of them.

49:04.763 --> 49:06.399
Oh, crossed wires.
You're talking about the girls.

49:06.500 --> 49:08.236
I'm talking about the clothes.

49:08.336 --> 49:10.642
- Step in, girls.
- Sorry.

49:10.742 --> 49:12.679
430, King's Road, please.

49:12.779 --> 49:14.616
Night, Steve.

49:23.066 --> 49:24.135
Coming through!

49:24.235 --> 49:26.272
Coming through,
make some room.

49:28.443 --> 49:30.013
Hey! That's for you.

49:31.550 --> 49:33.688
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

49:33.788 --> 49:37.027
[All cheering]

49:39.198 --> 49:40.635
What's your hurry? Eh?

49:43.641 --> 49:45.310
You got a minute?

49:45.410 --> 49:47.448
Yeah.

49:48.851 --> 49:51.055
Is this about the money
Malcolm gets when we sign?

49:51.155 --> 49:54.428
Cos I think we should be talking
about this to the others, too.

49:54.529 --> 49:56.567
It ain't about the money.

49:56.667 --> 49:58.704
It's about... [Clears throat]

50:01.209 --> 50:03.113
...personnel.

50:05.619 --> 50:06.720
You are fucking joking!

50:06.820 --> 50:08.591
- Thing is...
- You are fucking joking!

50:08.691 --> 50:10.294
I was talking to John...

50:10.394 --> 50:11.564
No, you weren't talking
to John.

50:11.664 --> 50:14.736
You were talking to Malcolm.

50:14.836 --> 50:18.443
And you weren't talking to him,
he was talking to you.

50:18.544 --> 50:20.213
Ah, come on,
you know this is mental.

50:20.313 --> 50:23.086
- You know you need me.
- It's my band!

50:23.420 --> 50:24.590
Mine.

50:24.690 --> 50:27.027
And what I'm trying
to say to you...

50:27.863 --> 50:30.267
...is you're sacked.

50:31.269 --> 50:32.572
All right.

50:33.675 --> 50:35.444
[Clears throat]

50:38.685 --> 50:42.091
Whenever Malcolm
feels like shafting you,

50:42.191 --> 50:44.596
you just bend over,
don't you?

50:44.696 --> 50:46.232
Malcolm's good little boy.

50:46.332 --> 50:48.436
You fucking...

50:48.537 --> 50:50.575
Yeah, come on.

50:50.675 --> 50:52.111
You love that.

50:52.211 --> 50:54.115
- Fuck it!
- Huh?

50:54.215 --> 50:56.520
You'd love to be able to say
that we had a big manly fight...

50:56.620 --> 50:58.356
Yeah?

50:58.456 --> 51:01.497
...so that you wouldn't have to
tell anyone that you bent over.

51:01.597 --> 51:03.601
Boys, boys, b...

51:06.640 --> 51:08.310
We're just going up the Roxy.

51:09.646 --> 51:11.249
Let's go.

51:12.853 --> 51:14.523
Steve, you coming?

51:16.560 --> 51:17.729
Why not, Steve?

51:19.600 --> 51:21.503
Yeah, Steve, why not?

51:27.415 --> 51:28.517
Fuck!

51:36.166 --> 51:37.636
[Jordan]
You look fabulous, ladies,

51:37.736 --> 51:40.675
but I'm afraid we're going
to need those pieces back.

51:40.775 --> 51:42.211
[Jeannie] Vivienne said...

51:42.311 --> 51:44.415
[Jordan] Vivienne said
you could exhibit them.

51:44.516 --> 51:46.352
She didn't say
you could own them.

51:46.452 --> 51:48.624
I bet the lads in the band
keep theirs.

51:48.724 --> 51:50.360
They do.

51:50.460 --> 51:54.168
But I imagine Malcolm deducts
the cost from their earnings.

51:54.903 --> 51:56.406
He does mine.

52:11.436 --> 52:12.772
A thank-you present.

52:12.872 --> 52:14.543
From Vivienne.

52:14.643 --> 52:17.147
For doing the clothes justice
on the night.

52:17.247 --> 52:20.320
I'm sure you'll be splashed all
over the New Musical Express.

52:20.420 --> 52:23.259
These are train tickets.
To Huddersfield.

52:23.359 --> 52:25.565
- With compliments.
- We've run away from home.

52:25.665 --> 52:28.871
And now you can run back and
tell everyone what you've seen.

52:28.971 --> 52:31.209
But, no... We're staying.

52:31.309 --> 52:34.415
You've got nothing,
you know nothing,

52:34.516 --> 52:36.720
and if you stay here,
you'll become nothing.

52:36.820 --> 52:40.193
You think we're just stupid
little girls, but we're punks.

52:40.293 --> 52:41.329
You're just old.

52:41.931 --> 52:44.201
"Old"? Well...

52:44.301 --> 52:46.205
We're the new generation gap.

52:47.475 --> 52:49.311
Good for you.

52:49.411 --> 52:53.286
And how long before you're
the old, new generation gap?

52:53.386 --> 52:55.625
What'll you have then
but a très boring story

52:55.725 --> 52:57.862
about how you were once
the brightest young things

52:57.962 --> 53:00.467
at some gig
no one even remembers?

53:01.770 --> 53:04.375
Go home.
Learn things.

53:04.910 --> 53:06.479
Get clever.

53:06.580 --> 53:08.450
Make your own destiny.

53:10.420 --> 53:11.890
We'll be back.

53:12.859 --> 53:14.629
Yeah.

53:14.729 --> 53:16.834
You can count on it.

53:16.934 --> 53:21.209
No one's gonna be fucking
bothered about fucking Glen!

53:21.309 --> 53:24.248
Fuck! No one's even
gonna know it was me.

53:26.720 --> 53:28.356
I just saw Glen at the Roxy.

53:29.726 --> 53:31.663
Oh.

53:31.763 --> 53:33.233
We had musical differences.

53:34.670 --> 53:35.938
He snores in the van.

53:36.038 --> 53:39.245
He's the best musician
and songwriter in your band.

53:39.345 --> 53:42.685
He dresses like Paul McCartney,
always washing his feet.

53:42.785 --> 53:45.558
- His feet?
- He doesn't fit the image.

53:49.332 --> 53:51.369
What's Malcolm got over you,
Steve?

53:52.438 --> 53:54.275
Why can't you ever
stand up to him?

53:54.375 --> 53:56.513
Cos he...

53:56.613 --> 53:58.283
Cos...

54:03.360 --> 54:05.263
Cos he stood up for me.

54:07.001 --> 54:09.438
In court.

54:09.539 --> 54:11.910
He said I meant something
to him.

54:12.879 --> 54:14.683
He gave me a chance.

54:14.783 --> 54:16.653
And you of all people,
you can...

54:16.753 --> 54:18.991
You can understand that.

54:19.091 --> 54:22.532
Can't you?
I mean, it's just like...

54:22.632 --> 54:24.703
...you with your music.
You...

54:26.339 --> 54:28.511
You just need someone...

54:29.713 --> 54:32.785
...to give you a chance.

54:35.057 --> 54:37.662
And they will.

54:37.762 --> 54:40.066
I mean, they will -
sooner than you think.

We have a replacement.

54:48.449 --> 54:51.990

to give a very unique individual

54:52.090 --> 54:53.994
the chance of a lifetime.

54:55.865 --> 54:57.467
The chance of a...

54:58.537 --> 55:00.340
Who is the replacement?

55:02.077 --> 55:03.346
Wait...

55:04.750 --> 55:06.085
Are you going to ask me?

No, it's all sorted.
