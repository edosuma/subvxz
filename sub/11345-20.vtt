WEBVTT

00:06.407 --> 00:08.476
- IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE
SYSTEM,

00:08.509 --> 00:12.113
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.748
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:14.782 --> 00:16.584
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:16.617 --> 00:17.751
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:17.785 --> 00:19.820
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.290
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:24.792 --> 00:27.795
- RUN! RUN!
- I'M COMING!

00:31.099 --> 00:33.334
- HURRY UP!
HE'S GONNA CATCH US!

00:33.367 --> 00:35.403
- I'M RUNNING
AS FAST AS I CAN!

00:35.436 --> 00:37.638
WATCH OUT!

00:37.671 --> 00:39.540
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
IS HE CLOSE?

00:39.573 --> 00:42.143
- YEAH, AND HE'S ABOUT
TO PLANT HIS PIRATE FLAG.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.613
- I'M LEAVING A TREASURE CHEST
TWO BLOCKS AWAY

00:45.646 --> 00:48.082
TO DISTRACT THE BASTARD.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.783
- LOOK OUT!

00:49.817 --> 00:52.086
LILY!
ARE YOU OKAY?

00:52.120 --> 00:55.156
- WHAT IDIOT LEFT
THEIR LUGGAGE HERE?

00:55.189 --> 00:58.292
- MAYBE THERE'S
SOMETHING COOL INSIDE.

01:00.161 --> 01:03.131
OH, MY GOD.

01:03.164 --> 01:05.699
- THE GIRLS THAT FOUND IT
WERE PLAYING AN ONLINE GAME?

01:05.733 --> 01:08.236
- YEAH, LIKE PLANT THE FLAG,
BUT WITH VIRTUAL PIRATES.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.870
THE ROLLING BAG
WAS ON THE SIDEWALK

01:09.903 --> 01:11.272
IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.640
- WE SURE IT'S OUR VICTIM?

01:12.673 --> 01:14.775
- I ONLY SAW HER HAND,
BUT IT'S GOTTA BE MARNIE.

01:14.808 --> 01:17.345
NO OTHER KIDS
WERE REPORTED MISSING.

01:17.378 --> 01:18.679
- HOW LONG SHE BEEN DEAD?

01:18.712 --> 01:20.881
- HARD TO SAY.
JUST GOING INTO RIGOR.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.850
BUT THE COLD WEATHER
WOULD'VE SLOWED DOWN DECOMP.

01:22.883 --> 01:25.853
- BETTER MAKE SURE.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.559
IT'S MARNIE.

01:31.592 --> 01:32.860
- OKAY,
LET'S GET HER OUT OF HERE.

01:34.395 --> 01:36.197
- PLEASE, NO, NO.
PLEASE! PLEASE!

01:36.230 --> 01:38.566
IS THAT HER?
IS THAT MY BABY?

01:38.599 --> 01:39.867
- WHOA, WHOA.
MA'AM, MA'AM.

01:39.900 --> 01:42.136
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.
- DETECTIVE TUTUOLA.

01:42.170 --> 01:46.474
NO, NO, NO!
[sobbing]

01:46.507 --> 01:48.242
OH, DON'T SAY IT,
PLEASE.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.211
[sobbing]

01:50.244 --> 01:52.580
- I'M SORRY.

01:52.613 --> 01:55.616
I'M SORRY, SUSAN.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.820
- OH, PLEASE!

02:01.222 --> 02:04.192
[suspenseful music]

02:04.225 --> 02:10.231
*

02:48.469 --> 02:50.804
- YESTERDAY AFTERNOON,
TEN-YEAR-OLD MARNIE FOSTER

02:50.838 --> 02:54.808
DISAPPEARED ON
HER WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.378
WE'RE VERY SORRY TO REPORT,
BUT THE GIRL'S REMAINS

02:57.411 --> 02:58.912
WERE LOCATED
A SHORT TIME AGO,

02:58.946 --> 03:01.282
AND A HOMICIDE
INVESTIGATION IS UNDERWAY.

03:01.315 --> 03:02.983
ANYONE WITH INFORMATION,

03:03.016 --> 03:04.952
PLEASE CALL
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT

03:04.985 --> 03:08.256
AT THE NUMBER
ON YOUR SCREEN.

03:08.289 --> 03:10.891
555-0174.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.760
THANK YOU.
- THANKS, DETECTIVE.

03:12.793 --> 03:13.994
SO THERE YOU HAVE IT...

03:14.027 --> 03:15.496
- HOW'D YOU
MAKE OUT IN THERE?

03:15.529 --> 03:16.930
- [sighs]
THE PRIEST GAVE US FULL ACCESS

03:16.964 --> 03:19.233
TO THE ENTIRE CHURCH.
THERE'S NO CRIME SCENE.

03:19.267 --> 03:20.100
- SOMEBODY HAD TO SEE

03:20.133 --> 03:21.802
WHO DROPPED THAT DUFFLE
ON THE STREET.

03:21.835 --> 03:24.238
- PATROL'S CANVASSING
THREE BLOCKS IN EVERY DIRECTION.

03:24.272 --> 03:26.307
- MAY HAVE A BREAK.
- WHAT, SURVEILLANCE?

03:26.340 --> 03:28.476
- PARKS DEPARTMENT.
[phone ringS]

03:28.509 --> 03:29.810
THEY GOT A CAMERA,
BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF THE CHURCH.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.446
THEY SENT ME THEIR VIDEO.
- BENSON.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.782
- THERE'S THE DUFFLE.
2:04 PM.

03:34.815 --> 03:37.618
- WELL, ROLL IT BACK,
WE'LL SEE WHO DROPPED IT.

03:40.821 --> 03:43.657
- DAMN IT,
MOVE THE TRUCK.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.728
THERE YOU GO.
NO DUFFLE.

03:47.761 --> 03:48.996
12:48 PM.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.998
- ANYTHING?
- WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE OUR PERP

03:51.031 --> 03:53.701
DUMPED MARNIE BETWEEN
1:45 AND 2:00.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.936
- BUT THE TRUCK BLOCKS,
SO YOU CAN'T SEE WHO.

03:55.969 --> 03:57.505
I'LL TRACK DOWN THE DRIVERS.
IF WE'RE LUCKY,

03:57.538 --> 03:59.873
ONE OF THEM SAW OUR GUY.
- WARNER CALLED.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.876
SHE WANTS US TO MEET
HER AND HUANG AT THE MORGUE.

04:02.910 --> 04:03.944
- NO DOUBT ABOUT IT,

04:03.977 --> 04:07.047
YOUR KILLER IS
A SEXUAL PREDATOR.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.849
- MARNIE WAS RAPED?

04:08.882 --> 04:10.418
- FRESHLY TORN HYMEN,

04:10.451 --> 04:12.520
BLOOD PRESENT
IN THE VAGINAL CANAL.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.388
- TELL ME THE SON
OF A BITCH LEFT HIS DNA.

04:14.422 --> 04:17.425
- I WISH.
NO FLUIDS, HAIRS, OR SKIN CELLS.

04:17.458 --> 04:18.826
AND NO SIGNS OF LUBRICANT.

04:18.859 --> 04:21.329
HE MUST'VE USED
SOME KIND OF FOREIGN OBJECT,

04:21.362 --> 04:22.830
AND IT HAD
TO BE SOMETHING SMOOTH.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.898
- SO THE PERVERT
COULDN'T RISE TO THE OCCASION,

04:24.932 --> 04:25.833
HE HAS TO SODOMIZE HER.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.536
- CAUSE OF DEATH?
- TRAUMATIC ASPHYXIA.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.338
FOUND PETECHIAE
IN THE CONJUCTIVA,

04:30.371 --> 04:32.640
AND COTTON
AND POLYESTER FIBERS

04:32.673 --> 04:34.708
IN HER LUNGS AND AIRWAYS.
SHE WAS SUFFOCATED.

04:34.742 --> 04:35.876
- WITH WHAT?

04:35.909 --> 04:39.780
- THE PILLOW
HER HEAD WAS RESTING ON.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.583
- DR. JACKSON.
- ELLIOT, OLIVIA.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.017
- CAP, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

04:44.051 --> 04:46.387
- COVERING FOR HUANG.
- GEORGE WAS KIND ENOUGH

04:46.420 --> 04:48.956
TO GIVE ME SOME
CONSULTING WORK WITH THE FBI

04:48.989 --> 04:51.024
WHEN MY CLINIC FOLDED.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.093
HE'S PRESENTING AT
A CONFERENCE DOWN IN WASHINGTON

04:53.126 --> 04:54.328
AND ASKED ME TO FILL IN.

04:54.362 --> 04:56.664
- SO WHAT
ARE WE LOOKING AT?

04:56.697 --> 04:59.400
- SOMEONE WHO MADE SURE
MARNIE WAS RESTING COMFORTABLY

04:59.433 --> 05:01.001
BEFORE HE ABANDONED HER.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.570
- HE WRAPPED HER IN
SILK SHEETS.

05:02.603 --> 05:03.871
- PADDED THE BOTTOM
WITH ONE,

05:03.904 --> 05:05.839
TUCKED HER IN WITH
THE OTHER.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.975
ALONG WITH THIS.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.610
- THAT DOLL
LOOKS LIKE MARNIE.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.878
- HE MAY BE
PREYING ON GIRLS

05:10.911 --> 05:13.013
WHO FIT
HIS IDEAL FANTASY.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.682
- IT'S ALREADY
BEEN SWABBED FOR DNA

05:14.715 --> 05:16.384
AND SENT OVER TO THE LAB.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.886
- SILK SHEETS,
PILLOW, DOLL...

05:18.919 --> 05:20.521
SOME PEDOPHILES
WILL GO TO ANY LENGTHS

05:20.554 --> 05:21.822
TO LURE LITTLE GIRLS.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.624
- THIS ONE DIDN'T
WANT MARNIE TO FEEL PAIN.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.793
HER STOMACH WAS
FULL OF MILK AND ZOLPIDEM.

05:25.826 --> 05:26.660
- SLEEPING PILLS,

05:26.694 --> 05:28.962
SO SHE WOULDN'T
FEEL HIM SMOTHERING HER.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.898
AND THEN HE DROPS HER OFF
AT THE CHURCH

05:30.931 --> 05:32.099
SO HE CAN ATONE
FOR HIS CRIME.

05:32.132 --> 05:35.002
- PILLOW, SILK SHEETS,
AND A DOLL.

05:35.035 --> 05:38.839
HIS WAY OF
SHOWERING HER WITH LOVE.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.641
HE MAY HAVE
RESORTED TO MURDER

05:40.674 --> 05:42.142
IN AN ATTEMPT
NOT TO GET CAUGHT.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.011
- OR GETTING CAUGHT AGAIN
AND GOING BACK TO PRISON.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.046
- SO...WHAT NOW?

05:46.079 --> 05:47.715
YOU ROUND UP
THE USUAL SUSPECTS?

05:47.748 --> 05:49.583
- EXACTLY.
EVERY REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER

05:49.617 --> 05:53.421
WHO EVER SO MUCH AS LOOKED
THE WRONG WAY AT A LITTLE GIRL.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.623
- CAP, WE MIGHT
NEED A HAND IN THIS.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.591
- ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO HELP.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.893
- AT LEAST
HUANG'S AN FBI AGENT,

05:59.927 --> 06:00.994
CAP'S NEVER DONE THIS.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.430
- I KNOW,
BUT I GOT A FEELING

06:02.463 --> 06:04.932
HE'LL BRING SOMETHING
TO THE TABLE.

06:04.965 --> 06:05.999
- ALL I DID
WAS BRUSH AGAINST HER,

06:06.033 --> 06:07.635
SHE STARTS SCREAMING
I GROPED.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.770
- THAT'S OLD NEWS, CRAIG.
WHERE WERE YOU YESTERDAY?

06:09.803 --> 06:12.005
- HAVING A CAMERA SHOVED
UP MY ASS.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.941
COLONOSCOPY.
WANNA SEE THE PICTURES?

06:13.974 --> 06:15.543
- A LETTER FROM
YOUR DOCTOR WILL DO.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.144
- CONSTITUTION
SAYS I'M ENTITLED TO LIFE,

06:17.177 --> 06:19.012
LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT
OF HAPPINESS.

06:19.046 --> 06:22.115
- THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE
PURSUING PRE-TEEN GIRLS.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.885
CAN ANYBODY ACCOUNT
FOR YOUR WHEREABOUTS YESTERDAY?

06:24.918 --> 06:25.686
- MY DEAR OLD MOTHER.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.054
I WAS VISITING HER
OUT IN JERSEY.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.889
- YOU HAVE TO COME
BETTER THAN THAT, SHANE.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.991
- I GOT THE TRAIN TICKET
TO PROVE IT.

06:31.024 --> 06:33.461
- I WAS AT WORK.
ASK ANY OF MY STUDENTS.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.995
- STUDENTS?

06:35.028 --> 06:36.730
YOU WERE CAUGHT
FEELING UP A TEN-YEAR-OLD.

06:36.764 --> 06:37.831
- BUT I WASN'T CONVICTED.

06:37.865 --> 06:40.067
- STILL, I'M PRETTY SHOCKED
THAT HUDSON UNIVERSITY

06:40.100 --> 06:42.169
DIDN'T FIRE YOU.
- THEY CAN'T.

06:42.202 --> 06:43.804
I HAVE TENURE.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.939
- [sighs]

06:45.973 --> 06:47.708
- JUST LETTING THEM ALL GO?

06:47.741 --> 06:49.009
- THEY ALL HAVE ALIBIS.

06:49.042 --> 06:52.012
WELCOME TO THE PERV PARADE
THAT LEADS TO NOWHERE.

06:52.045 --> 06:54.848
- [chuckles]
ANY PROGRESS ON THE DOLL?

06:54.882 --> 06:56.850
- YEAH, THE NAME IS
PERFECT PENNY.

06:56.884 --> 06:59.653
MANUFACTURER STOPPED
MAKING IT IN 1989.

06:59.687 --> 07:01.589
IT HASN'T BEEN ON STORE
SHELVES IN OVER 20 YEARS.

07:01.622 --> 07:04.057
- AND IT WASN'T MARNIE'S,
ACCORDING TO HER MOTHER.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.859
- WHERE'S MARNIE'S FATHER?

07:05.893 --> 07:07.628
- ON HIS WAY BACK
FROM HONOLULU,

07:07.661 --> 07:09.797
BUT HE LEFT
BEFORE MARNIE DISAPPEARED.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.499
- HE WASN'T HERE
TO DUMP THAT DUFFLE.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.867
- DOESN'T MEAN
HE DIDN'T ABUSE HER.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.636
SOME PEDOPHILES
WORK IN PAIRS.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.472
- LET'S GO
WELCOME DAD HOME.

07:20.608 --> 07:21.775
- JUST TELL ME WHY NOT?

07:21.809 --> 07:22.743
JUST...
[fighting continues]

07:22.776 --> 07:25.145
- DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
A VERY HAPPY HOMECOMING.

07:25.178 --> 07:28.015
[yelling distantly]

07:28.048 --> 07:30.183
DID HE JUST SHOVE HER?
- FOSTER, POLICE!

07:32.119 --> 07:33.821
- HEY, SUSAN, YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.623
- YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME?
- NAME'S NOT FOSTER!

07:36.624 --> 07:38.025
- WHAT IS YOUR NAME,
DOUCHE BAG?

07:38.058 --> 07:40.160
- CHET HADLER.
WHAT'D I DO?

07:40.193 --> 07:42.963
- ASSAULT.
- I DIDN'T TOUCH YOU, MAN.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.999
- YOU JUST SHOVED
A DEAD GIRL'S MOTHER.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.903
- SUSAN IS MY GIRLFRIEND.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.972
- FOR REAL OR
IN YOUR DREAMS, CHESTER?

07:52.005 --> 07:53.774
- SHE WAS GONNA
LEAVE HER HUSBAND

07:53.807 --> 07:55.543
AND BRING MARNIE TO
LIVE WITH ME.

07:55.576 --> 07:56.944
- WHAT, SO YOU COULD
PUSH THEM BOTH AROUND?

07:56.977 --> 07:58.879
OR DID YOU JUMP THE GUN
AND PUSH MARNIE

07:58.912 --> 08:00.881
INTO DOING SOMETHING
THAT YOU HAD TO KILL HER FOR?

08:00.914 --> 08:03.917
- I NEVER TOUCHED THE KID.

08:03.951 --> 08:06.954
- HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.

08:06.987 --> 08:07.888
CHET WAS THERE FOR ME

08:07.921 --> 08:09.823
WHEN MICHAEL AND I
WERE HAVING PROBLEMS.

08:09.857 --> 08:12.159
- DOES YOUR HUSBAND
KNOW ABOUT HIM?

08:12.192 --> 08:13.861
- I CONFESSED.
TWO MONTHS AGO.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.963
I TOLD CHET WE HAD
TO STOP SEEING EACH OTHER.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.999
BUT...
[chuckles]

08:19.032 --> 08:20.768
HE WON'T TAKE
NO FOR AN ANSWER.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.102
HE SAYS WE'RE MEANT
FOR EACH OTHER.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.871
- HE TELL YOU
ABOUT HIS POLICE RECORD?

08:23.904 --> 08:26.607
- CHET WAS ARRESTED?

08:26.640 --> 08:27.575
FOR WHAT?

08:27.608 --> 08:30.010
- YOU FORCIBLY TOUCHED
A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL--

08:30.043 --> 08:32.045
YOUR LAST
GIRLFRIEND'S KID.

08:32.079 --> 08:34.882
- IT WAS THAT
LITTLE BITCH'S IDEA.

08:34.915 --> 08:37.618
- THAT LITTLE BITCH TOLD ME
YOU WANTED A THREESOME.

08:37.651 --> 08:39.787
YOU TRY THAT WITH
SUSAN AND MARNIE TOO?

08:39.820 --> 08:41.121
- A THREESOME?

08:41.154 --> 08:42.322
MY DAUGHTER IS DEAD,

08:42.355 --> 08:44.992
HOW CAN YOU ACCUSE ME
OF DOING THAT?

08:45.025 --> 08:46.794
- BECAUSE YOU LIED
ABOUT WHERE YOU WERE

08:46.827 --> 08:48.829
WHEN MARNIE DISAPPEARED.
- I WAS AT WORK.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.698
- WELL YOUR BOSS SAYS
DIFFERENT.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.801
HE SAYS THAT
YOU LEFT AFTER LUNCH.

08:59.206 --> 09:02.209
CHET AND I CHECKED INTO
THE AMSTERDAM HOTEL AT 1:30.

09:04.745 --> 09:07.715
WE WERE...

09:07.748 --> 09:11.619
WE WERE IN BED
WHEN MY BABY DISAPPEARED.

09:15.723 --> 09:17.057
- GREAT.
SHE'S GETTING LAID

09:17.090 --> 09:19.292
WHILE HER DAUGHTER'S
RAPED AND MURDERED.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.595
GLAD I DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN
THAT TO MARNIE'S FATHER.

09:21.629 --> 09:23.030
- FIN INTERVIEWED HIM
WHEN HE GOT HOME,

09:23.063 --> 09:24.598
HE'S IN UTTER SHOCK.
THERE'S NO WAY

09:24.632 --> 09:25.432
HE HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

09:25.465 --> 09:28.802
- SO WE GOT A DEAD GIRL,
NO SUSPECTS.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.103
- MAYBE BECAUSE
WE HAVEN'T CONSIDERED

09:30.137 --> 09:32.039
ALL THE POSSIBILITIES.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.874
- OKAY, LIKE?

09:33.907 --> 09:36.744
- THAT OUR PERPETRATOR'S
A WOMAN.

09:36.777 --> 09:39.279
- A WOMAN?
WHO KILLS AND RAPES?

09:39.312 --> 09:42.149
- IT'S VERY RARE,
BUT IT'S NOT UNHEARD OF.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.885
OUR PERP MADE SURE
THAT MARNIE WAS ASLEEP

09:44.918 --> 09:46.319
BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED,

09:46.353 --> 09:49.222
THEN WRAPPED HER
IN A PINK SILK SHEET

09:49.256 --> 09:51.959
AND LAID HER ON ANOTHER
THAT WAS CAREFULLY FOLDED,

09:51.992 --> 09:55.095
PUT HER HEAD ON
A LAVENDER PILLOW WITH A DOLL.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.130
- EVERYTHING THAT
A MALE PERV WOULD'VE DONE

09:57.164 --> 09:59.132
TO CONVINCE
A SMALL GIRL LIKE MARNIE

09:59.166 --> 10:00.968
THAT HE WAS
TO BE LOVED AND TRUSTED.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.069
- EXCEPT THERE WAS NO DNA

10:02.102 --> 10:04.037
AND NO SIGN
OF PENILE PENETRATION.

10:04.071 --> 10:04.905
- AND YOU HEARD WARNER,

10:04.938 --> 10:06.740
THAT HE COULD'VE
USED A FOREIGN OBJECT.

10:06.774 --> 10:10.043
- OR SHE COULD HAVE.

10:10.077 --> 10:11.645
OLIVIA, DID YOU SLEEP
WITH A DOLL

10:11.679 --> 10:14.081
WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD?
- SURE.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.950
- CAN YOU REMEMBER WHY?

10:16.984 --> 10:18.852
- BECAUSE IT MADE ME
FEEL SAFE.

10:18.886 --> 10:20.087
- RIGHT.
- HOWEVER,

10:20.120 --> 10:21.922
IN ALL OF
OUR YEARS AT SVU,

10:21.955 --> 10:24.224
HOW MANY FEMALE-ON-FEMALE
MOLESTERS HAVE WE COLLARED?

10:24.257 --> 10:26.026
- I CAN COUNT THEM
ON BOTH HANDS.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.227
AND WE HAVE NEVER
ARRESTED A WOMAN

10:27.260 --> 10:29.763
FOR SODOMIZING AND
MURDERING A GIRL SOLO.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.865
- YEAH,
BUT JUST CONSIDER THIS.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.801
A MAN WOULD'VE LEFT MARNIE
IN FRONT OF A CHURCH

10:33.834 --> 10:35.335
IN ORDER TO ATONE
FOR HIS SIN,

10:35.368 --> 10:38.171
BUT OUR PERP
MIGHT'VE LEFT HER THERE--

10:38.205 --> 10:41.675
- TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS
SAFE IN THE HANDS OF GOD.

10:41.709 --> 10:44.044
- RIGHT.

10:47.380 --> 10:51.051
HARD AS IT IS
TO BELIEVE,

10:51.084 --> 10:53.186
I THINK
OUR KILLER'S A WOMAN.

11:03.931 --> 11:06.399
- THANK YOU.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.267
SOMETHING I SHOULD'VE SAID

11:07.300 --> 11:08.902
WHEN YOU SENT
THOSE BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS

11:08.936 --> 11:11.438
TO MY DAUGHTER'S
FUNERAL.

11:11.471 --> 11:14.074
- WE WERE SO SORRY
TO HEAR THAT ANN HAD PASSED.

11:14.107 --> 11:17.010
- YEAH.

11:19.246 --> 11:21.014
- SO...

11:21.048 --> 11:23.951
ANY PLANS
TO REOPEN YOUR CLINIC?

11:23.984 --> 11:25.418
- HAVEN'T YOU HEARD?

11:25.452 --> 11:27.888
I'M A CHARLATAN.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.957
ALL MY PEERS CAN SEE
IS THAT I'VE VIOLATED

11:29.990 --> 11:31.892
THE CONFIDENTIALITY
OF MY PATIENTS.

11:31.925 --> 11:35.829
- YOU SAVED YOUR PATIENTS
FROM A KILLER.

11:35.863 --> 11:38.866
- I COULDN'T SAVE
MY DAUGHTER, THOUGH.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.934
- CAP, YOU SURE
YOU'RE UP FOR THIS?

11:44.304 --> 11:46.974
- YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
DO YOU?

11:47.007 --> 11:50.744
YOU DON'T BELIEVE
THAT A LONE WOMAN

11:50.778 --> 11:52.145
COULD'VE MURDERED THIS GIRL.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.081
- THE FEW FEMALE MOLESTERS

11:54.114 --> 11:56.216
THAT WE'VE SEEN
WHO HAVE KILLED

11:56.249 --> 11:57.918
HAVE WORKED
WITH A MALE ACCOMPLICE.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.987
- AND WHAT ABOUT THE WOMEN
WHO'VE MOLESTED ALONE?

12:00.020 --> 12:03.891
- MRS. ROBINSON TYPES
WHO SEDUCE TEENAGE BOYS.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.893
MOST OF THEM ARE TEACHERS
WHO SAY THEY'RE IN LOVE

12:05.926 --> 12:06.994
AND THEY DON'T BELIEVE

12:07.027 --> 12:08.762
THAT THEY'RE DOING
ANYTHING WRONG.

12:08.796 --> 12:11.965
- BUT WOMEN
WHO SEXUALLY ABUSE GIRLS...

12:11.999 --> 12:13.533
THEY'RE DIFFERENT,
OLIVIA.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.068
THE FEW I'VE MET,

12:15.102 --> 12:16.870
THEY'RE APPALLED
BY WHAT THEY'D DONE.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.171
- BUT HAVE YOU EVER MET ONE

12:18.205 --> 12:20.073
WHO'S ACTUALLY
KILLED THEIR VICTIM?

12:20.107 --> 12:21.174
- I'VE MET TWO.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.410
THEY BOTH
SEEMED ENTIRELY NORMAL,

12:23.443 --> 12:25.278
BUT THEY WERE
TOTALLY LACKING IN EMPATHY.

12:25.312 --> 12:28.849
AND THEY WERE LATER
DIAGNOSED AS SOCIOPATHS.

12:28.882 --> 12:31.885
BUT OUR KILLER'S
DIFFERENT.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.220
THE WAY SHE TREATED MARNIE

12:33.253 --> 12:37.224
SHOWS GENUINE
FEELINGS OF TENDERNESS.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.459
- OUR PERP
WAS ABUSED HERSELF.

12:39.492 --> 12:42.162
- YEAH.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.898
I THINK THE CLUE TO HER PSYCHE

12:44.932 --> 12:48.368
IS PERFECT PENNY.

12:48.401 --> 12:49.970
A TOTEM FOR THE INNOCENCE

12:50.003 --> 12:53.173
THAT SHE FEELS
HER ABUSER STOLE FROM HER.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.808
SHE WAS TARGETED FOR
THE QUALITIES

12:54.842 --> 12:57.110
THE KILLER BELIEVES
SHE HERSELF HAD LOST.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.947
GOODNESS, SWEETNESS,
INNOCENCE.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.983
- WE HAVE TO TALK TO
EVERY WOMAN IN MARNIE'S LIFE.

13:05.986 --> 13:08.822
- I TOOK CARE OF MARNIE
SINCE SHE WAS A BABY.

13:08.856 --> 13:10.924
I SHOULD'VE BEEN HERE.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.292
- WHERE WERE YOU
ON MONDAY AFTERNOON?

13:12.325 --> 13:13.393
- VISITING MY MOTHER.

13:13.426 --> 13:16.596
SEÑORA FOSTER
GAVE ME THE WEEK OFF.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.999
- CAN YOU TELL ME
WHERE MARNIE MAY HAVE GONE

13:19.032 --> 13:20.567
THE AFTERNOON
THAT SHE DISAPPEARED?

13:20.600 --> 13:22.903
- MONDAY AFTER SCHOOL

13:22.936 --> 13:25.138
IS PIANO LESSONS.

13:25.172 --> 13:29.877
- I GAVE MARNIE LESSONS
EVERY MONDAY AFTERNOON

13:29.910 --> 13:31.912
FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.180
- BUT NOT THIS PAST
MONDAY?

13:33.213 --> 13:36.950
- NO, HER MOTHER
CALLED AND CANCELLED.

13:36.984 --> 13:40.387
I WAS DISAPPOINTED
BECAUSE...

13:40.420 --> 13:44.324
SHE SHOWED
SUCH PROGRESS LATELY.

13:44.357 --> 13:47.594
- IT'S OKAY TO GRIEVE,
MS. FRYE.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.930
- SHE USED TO
LOVE POKING AROUND

13:49.963 --> 13:53.967
ASKING WHERE ALL MY OLD STUFF
CAME FROM.

13:54.001 --> 13:57.004
MY PARENTS DIED IN
A CAR ACCIDENT WHEN I WAS 17,

13:57.037 --> 14:00.007
AND I HAVEN'T CHANGED
ANYTHING SINCE.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.942
LOOK AT HER.

14:01.975 --> 14:03.911
IT WAS PERFECT POSTURE.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.913
PERFECT WEIGHT TRANSFER,

14:05.946 --> 14:09.983
PERFECT HAND POSITION.

14:10.017 --> 14:12.152
SHE HAD SUCH NATURAL TALENT.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.653
- MARNIE WASN'T
JUST TALENTED,

14:13.686 --> 14:16.990
SHE WAS A TEAM PLAYER
AND A LEADER.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.626
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU TOOK
A SPECIAL INTEREST IN HER.

14:19.659 --> 14:22.062
- THE WHOLE SCHOOL DID.
- DID SHE EVER MENTION

14:22.095 --> 14:26.233
ANYONE TAKING
TOO MUCH INTEREST IN HER?

14:26.266 --> 14:28.401
BULLYING, PERHAPS?
- AS FAR AS I KNOW,

14:28.435 --> 14:30.938
MARNIE DIDN'T
HAVE ONE ENEMY ANYWHERE.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.272
- SAME ANSWER I GOT.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.574
AND ALL MARNIE'S
FEMALE TEACHERS HAVE AN ALIBI

14:34.607 --> 14:35.675
FOR WHEN SHE DISAPPEARED.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.278
- WHOEVER WE'RE LOOKING FOR
IS WAY UNDER THE RADAR.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.013
- WELL,
SHE COULD WELL SURFACE

14:40.047 --> 14:42.015
AT MARNIE'S FUNERAL
TOMORROW.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.083
- AND FACE HER PARENTS?

14:43.116 --> 14:45.986
- OH, SHE'LL DO EVERYTHING
SHE CAN TO AVOID THEM.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.554
SHE PROBABLY
BELIEVES IN HER HEART

14:47.587 --> 14:49.422
THAT SHE LOVED MARNIE.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.324
SHE COULD
WELL BE MOURNING HER

14:51.358 --> 14:54.995
AS MUCH AS ANYONE.
MORE, EVEN.

14:55.028 --> 14:57.998
[solemn music]

14:58.031 --> 15:06.039
*

15:10.710 --> 15:13.113
- NOT TO BURST YOUR BUBBLE,
BUT I DIDN'T SEE ANYONE

15:13.146 --> 15:15.949
THAT DIDN'T
SKIP THE RECEIVING LINE.

15:15.983 --> 15:18.618
- SHE HAS TO BE HERE SOMEWHERE,
I'M SURE OF IT.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.253
- FIN, ANYTHING?

15:20.287 --> 15:22.022
- JUST A BUNCH OF
HEARTBREAK.

15:22.055 --> 15:23.290
- LIV, MORE OF THE SAME?

15:23.323 --> 15:26.126
- PRETTY MUCH.
NOTHING UNUSUAL HERE.

15:29.629 --> 15:32.632
HOLD ON, A WOMAN BOLTING
AT YOUR 2:00.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.735
JUNE, RIGHT?

15:35.768 --> 15:37.237
- LET ME GO.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.072
- I DIDN'T SEE YOU
IN THE CHURCH.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.607
- YEAH, WELL,
I NEED TO GO HOME.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.409
- WHY DON'T WE GO TALK
SOMEPLACE WHERE IT'S WARM?

15:42.442 --> 15:44.611
LET'S GO BACK IN.
- I DON'T WANNA TALK.

15:44.644 --> 15:45.712
- HOLD ON.
- PLEASE.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.680
- HOLD ON!

15:47.714 --> 15:49.482
- THAT'S MARNIE'S
PIANO TEACHER.

15:49.516 --> 15:52.719
- MAYBE A LOT MORE.

15:52.752 --> 15:55.055
- JUNE FRYE, 37.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.489
NO POLICE RECORD,
NEVER BEEN IN TROUBLE,

15:56.523 --> 15:57.624
NEVER BEEN MARRIED.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.559
SHE TEACHES PIANO
OUT OF A BROWNSTONE

15:59.592 --> 16:01.394
THAT SHE INHERITED
FROM HER PARENTS.

16:01.428 --> 16:02.762
- RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER
FROM THE CHURCH

16:02.795 --> 16:04.564
MARNIE WAS FOUND
IN FRONT OF.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.499
- JUNE TOLD OLIVIA
THAT MARNIE'S MOTHER CALLED

16:06.533 --> 16:08.201
TO CANCEL
HER PIANO LESSON.

16:08.235 --> 16:11.071
- AND MARNIE'S MOM JUST
TOLD ME THAT THAT'S A CROCK.

16:11.104 --> 16:14.174
SHE SAID JUNE CALLED HER
JUST AFTER 2:00

16:14.207 --> 16:15.475
TO SAY
THAT IT WAS CANCELLED.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.177
AND THAT'S NOT ALL.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.612
JUNE'S PHONE RECORDS
SHOW THAT SHE BLEW OFF

16:19.646 --> 16:22.149
A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER
STUDENTS BETWEEN 3:30 AND 4:00.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.017
- BUT IF JUNE
CANCELLED MARNIE'S LESSON,

16:24.051 --> 16:25.318
WHY DID MARNIE
TURN UP AT JUNE'S HOUSE?

16:25.352 --> 16:26.786
- MARNIE'S MOM
CALLED THE SCHOOL

16:26.819 --> 16:28.721
AND ASKED THE SECRETARY TO
PASS ON THE MESSAGE.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.423
THE SECRETARY FORGOT.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.192
- SO MARNIE THOUGHT
SHE HAD A LESSON.

16:32.225 --> 16:35.128
SHE SHOWS UP AT JUNE'S,
AND JUNE KILLS HER?

16:35.162 --> 16:37.030
WHY WAIT TWO YEARS
TO ACT?

16:37.064 --> 16:39.332
- OH, SHE WOULD'VE BEEN
FIGHTING HER FEELINGS.

16:39.366 --> 16:42.335
AND THEY COULD'VE BEEN
BEGINNING TO OVERWHELM HER,

16:42.369 --> 16:44.704
WHICH IS WHY
SHE CANCELLED THE LESSON.

16:44.737 --> 16:47.040
THEN MARNIE
TURNS UP UNEXPECTEDLY

16:47.074 --> 16:47.807
AND PUSHES HER OVER
THE EDGE.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.242
- WELL,
IF THAT'S THE CASE,

16:49.276 --> 16:51.044
THEN JUNE'S BROWNSTONE
IS OUR CRIME SCENE.

16:51.078 --> 16:51.978
WE NEED A SEARCH WARRANT.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.314
- WELL, GUYS,
WHY DON'T WE JUST ASK JUNE

16:54.347 --> 16:56.049
IF WE CAN
LOOK AROUND HER HOUSE?

16:56.083 --> 16:56.916
- FIRST, SHE WON'T LET US,

16:56.949 --> 16:58.451
AND SECONDLY,
SHE'LL DESTROY EVIDENCE

16:58.485 --> 16:59.586
IF SHE THINKS
WE'RE ONTO HER.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.754
- BUT SHE KNEW THAT WHEN
OLIVIA LOOKED HER IN THE EYES

17:01.788 --> 17:04.791
THIS AFTERNOON
OUTSIDE THE CHURCH.

17:09.129 --> 17:11.298
[piano plays]
[knock]

17:11.331 --> 17:14.801
*

17:14.834 --> 17:16.703
[piano playing stops]

17:20.707 --> 17:21.774
- WHAT DO YOU WANT NOW?

17:21.808 --> 17:23.810
- WE REALLY
NEED YOUR HELP, JUNE.

17:23.843 --> 17:26.779
- I CAN'T.
PLEASE DON'T COME HERE AGAIN.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.715
- WAS THAT THE ETUDE NO.3?

17:28.748 --> 17:32.219
YOU MAKE IT SOUND
SO EASY.

17:32.252 --> 17:34.654
WHENEVER I PLAY CHOPIN,
I ALWAYS MANAGE TO BUTCHER IT.

17:34.687 --> 17:38.425
[chuckles]
I'M DR. JACKSON.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.461
I'M HELPING THE DETECTIVES
ON MARNIE'S CASE.

17:43.230 --> 17:46.266
- IT'S TOO PAINFUL TO
TALK ABOUT HER.

17:46.299 --> 17:48.435
- EVEN IF
IT COULD HELP LEAD US

17:48.468 --> 17:52.605
TO THE PERSON
WHO TOOK MARNIE FROM US?

17:52.639 --> 17:55.875
PLEASE.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.710
IT'LL ONLY TAKE
A FEW MINUTES.

18:04.317 --> 18:07.154
IT'S
A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE, JUNE.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.590
I WONDER, WOULD IT BE
POSSIBLE FOR US

18:10.623 --> 18:13.826
TO HAVE A CUP OF TEA?

18:13.860 --> 18:15.328
- I'LL PUT THE WATER ON.

18:15.362 --> 18:16.829
- CAN I USE
THE BATHROOM, PLEASE?

18:19.899 --> 18:22.235
- YES.
IT'S DOWNSTAIRS.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.304
- THANK YOU.

18:24.337 --> 18:27.240
SMOOTH TALKER.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.475
- DOES THAT MEAN
WE CAN SEARCH?

18:28.508 --> 18:30.210
- ANYTHING WE SEE
WITHOUT OPENING

18:30.243 --> 18:32.145
A DRAWER OR DOOR
IS FAIR GAME.

18:32.179 --> 18:34.881
- I'LL KEEP MY EYE
ON JUNE.

18:41.688 --> 18:44.691
- "OCTOBER, 1979."

18:45.725 --> 18:48.561
CAP...

18:48.595 --> 18:52.265
IT'S LIKE TIME STOPPED
IN THIS HOUSE 30 YEARS AGO.

18:52.299 --> 18:53.733
- SOMETHING HAPPENED HERE

18:53.766 --> 18:56.869
WHICH BROUGHT JUNE'S LIFE
TO A SCREECHING HALT.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.941
ELLIOT, WHAT'S THIS?

19:01.974 --> 19:05.312
- DON'T TOUCH THAT.

19:10.850 --> 19:11.951
IT'S FAKE.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.421
LOOKS LIKE THE HAIR ON THE DOLL
THAT MARNIE WAS HOLDING.

19:14.454 --> 19:15.722
- SHE'S COMING.

19:15.755 --> 19:18.758
- DOWNSTAIRS.

19:25.898 --> 19:29.536
SAME KIND OF PILLOWS THAT
WERE TUCKED UNDER MARNIE'S HEAD.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.438
- [sniffs]
YOU SMELL THAT?

19:31.471 --> 19:32.805
THAT'S BLEACH.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.675
- JUNE'S BEEN TRYING
TO CLEAN UP DOWN HERE.

19:37.477 --> 19:40.480
- WELL,
THIS TRASH CAN'S EMPTY.

19:45.685 --> 19:49.756
- BECAUSE SHE ALREADY
TOOK OUT THE GARBAGE.

19:49.789 --> 19:52.725
[playing Moonlight Sonata]

19:52.759 --> 20:01.901
*

20:01.934 --> 20:04.437
- YOU PLAY BEAUTIFULLY.

20:04.471 --> 20:07.974
*

20:08.007 --> 20:11.344
- WHAT ARE
WE LOOKING FOR?

20:12.945 --> 20:14.847
- [mumbles]
I DON'T KNOW.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.917
THIS.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.352
- ARE YOU SURE
THAT'S JUNE'S?

20:19.386 --> 20:20.487
- IT'S THE SAME
LUGGAGE SET

20:20.520 --> 20:23.523
AS THE DUFFLE BAG
MARNIE WAS FOUND IN.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.926
THIS MUST BE WHAT JUNE
USED ON MARNIE.

20:26.959 --> 20:29.962
[music stops abruptly]

20:29.996 --> 20:31.864
Benson on walkie:
MANHATTAN SVU TO CENTRAL,

20:31.898 --> 20:34.801
RUSH A BUS TO
451 HAMILTON TERRACE

20:34.834 --> 20:36.736
FOR CARDIAC ARREST.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.438
- 10-4, MANHATTAN SVU.
BUS IS ON ITS WAY.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.672
- WHAT HAPPENED?

20:39.706 --> 20:41.874
- SHE WAS PLAYING,
AND SHE JUST COLLAPSED.

20:43.843 --> 20:47.780
- SHE'S NOT BREATHING.

20:47.814 --> 20:50.617
[grunting]

20:50.650 --> 20:51.684
COME ON, GIRL.

20:51.718 --> 20:52.985
- IT'S EMPTY.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.388
- ZOLPIDEM.
IT'S WHAT SHE FED MARNIE.

20:55.422 --> 20:56.889
SHE SAY ANYTHING?

20:56.923 --> 20:58.925
- "TELL MARNIE'S PARENTS
I'M SORRY."

21:11.738 --> 21:13.906
- WHERE AM I?
- MERCY HOSPITAL.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.008
DR. JACKSON
SAVED YOUR LIFE.

21:16.042 --> 21:18.445
- IT'S NOT WORTH SAVING.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.680
- YOU KNOW,
YOU'D FEEL BETTER

21:20.713 --> 21:24.384
IF YOU TOLD US WHY
YOU TRIED TO KILL YOURSELF.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.919
- JUNE, WE FOUND THE SUITCASE
THAT YOU THREW OUT.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.955
IT MATCHES THE DUFFLE
THAT MARNIE WAS FOUND IN.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.523
- THERE WAS
A WOODEN SPOON INSIDE.

21:30.557 --> 21:32.325
- NO, PLEASE.
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, STOP.

21:32.359 --> 21:35.895
- THE SLEEPING PILLS THAT
YOU TRIED TO KILL YOURSELF WITH

21:35.928 --> 21:37.930
ARE THE SAME ONES
IN MARNIE'S STOMACH.

21:37.964 --> 21:40.567
AND WE FOUND HAIR IN
YOUR LIVING ROOM

21:40.600 --> 21:43.636
THAT MATCHES THE DOLL
THAT WAS LEFT WITH HER.

21:43.670 --> 21:46.673
- [whispers] LEAVE ME ALONE.
- JUNE...

21:48.975 --> 21:51.911
I KNOW YOU LOVE MARNIE.

21:51.944 --> 21:54.781
BUT GIVE HER PARENTS
SOME PEACE

21:54.814 --> 21:57.817
AND TELL US WHY
YOU SAID YOU'RE SORRY.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.892
- I WILL DIE...

22:05.925 --> 22:08.928
BEFORE I TALK ABOUT MARNIE.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.966
- THE LAB SWABBED
THE SUITCASE AND THE SPOON

22:14.000 --> 22:15.735
AND CAME BACK WITH ZIP.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.970
THE BLEACH JUNE USED
DESTROYED ANY DNA.

22:18.004 --> 22:18.938
- DO WE HAVE ANY EVIDENCE?

22:18.971 --> 22:21.007
- CSU DUSTED HER HOUSE
FOR MARNIE'S PRINTS,

22:21.040 --> 22:22.642
AND FOUND THEM UPSTAIRS.

22:22.675 --> 22:23.976
- ALONG WITH DOZENS
OF OTHER KIDS

22:24.010 --> 22:26.813
WHO TOOK PIANO LESSONS.
- IT HAS TO BE JUNE.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.415
THAT SUITCASE
IS FROM THE SAME SET

22:28.448 --> 22:30.016
AS THE DUFFLE
WE FOUND MARNIE IN.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.518
- THE FAKE HAIR
DOESN'T PROVE

22:31.551 --> 22:32.819
THAT THE DOLL
BELONGED TO JUNE.

22:32.852 --> 22:35.955
AND WITHOUT THE DNA,
THE WOODEN SPOON IS USELESS.

22:35.988 --> 22:37.924
- FACE IT,
IF JUNE DOESN'T SUDDENLY

22:37.957 --> 22:39.792
DECIDE TO GIVE IT UP,
WE'RE SCREWED.

22:39.826 --> 22:40.793
- SHE'S GOT A SECRET,

22:40.827 --> 22:42.995
WE JUST GOTTA FIGURE OUT
HOW TO UNLOCK THE DOOR.

22:46.433 --> 22:48.735
- ME?

22:48.768 --> 22:50.002
- YOU'RE
THE SWEET-TALKER HERE.

22:50.036 --> 22:53.039
IT WORKED ONCE,
WHY NOT GIVE IT ANOTHER SHOT?

23:04.050 --> 23:05.985
- I TOLD YOU
I WASN'T GONNA SAY ANYTHING.

23:06.018 --> 23:08.555
- I'M CERTAINLY
NOT GOING TO FORCE YOU TO.

23:08.588 --> 23:11.023
- YOU SHOULD'VE LET ME DIE.

23:11.057 --> 23:13.926
- SO YOU'D SEE
NO MORE SUNSETS,

23:13.960 --> 23:17.897
OR PLAY NO MORE OF
THAT MUSIC YOU LOVE SO MUCH?

23:17.930 --> 23:20.967
- THERE'S NOTHING
FOR US TO TALK ABOUT.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.804
- EXCEPT WHY YOU TRIED
TO END YOUR LIFE.

23:26.973 --> 23:28.875
- YOU'RE A WHAT?
PSYCHOLOGIST?

23:28.908 --> 23:31.077
- PSYCHIATRIST.
SAME DIFFERENCE.

23:31.110 --> 23:32.712
JUST A FEW
MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.213
- OH.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.516
SO YOU KNOW WHY PEOPLE
TRY TO KILL THEMSELVES.

23:36.549 --> 23:38.150
- YEAH, 'CAUSE THEY
HAVE MORE PAIN INSIDE THEM

23:38.184 --> 23:40.487
THAN THEY CAN BEAR.

23:40.520 --> 23:43.189
AND THEY THINK
THAT THROWING IN THE TOWEL

23:43.222 --> 23:48.094
IS EASIER THAN FACING
THE CAUSE OF THAT PAIN.

23:48.127 --> 23:51.864
- I DON'T DESERVE TO LIVE.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.933
- WHY DO YOU THINK THAT?

23:58.938 --> 24:02.141
WHEN DID YOU START PLAYING
THE PIANO?

24:02.174 --> 24:05.177
- I WAS FIVE.
MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.981
SHE SAID MUSIC WAS
THE ONE PLACE IN HER LIFE

24:09.015 --> 24:12.552
WHERE SHE COULD FIND...

24:12.585 --> 24:14.453
- PERFECTION.

24:18.157 --> 24:21.961
YOU WERE AN ONLY CHILD?
- YES.

24:21.994 --> 24:23.996
- SHE MUST'VE TREASURED YOU.

24:27.934 --> 24:29.536
- SHE USED TO
READ ME STORIES.

24:29.569 --> 24:31.704
- WHAT SORT OF STORIES?

24:31.738 --> 24:33.172
- FAIRY TALES.

24:33.205 --> 24:36.475
SHE CALLED ME
HER LITTLE PRINCESS.

24:42.882 --> 24:46.085
- PRINCESSES LEAD SUCH
PERFECT LIVES, DON'T THEY?

24:51.023 --> 24:53.926
DID YOUR MOTHER
GIVE YOU THIS?

24:53.960 --> 24:55.562
- NO.

24:55.595 --> 24:58.965
MY FATHER GAVE IT TO ME.

24:58.998 --> 25:02.301
- TELL ME ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.170
- I DON'T--
I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT HIM.

25:04.203 --> 25:07.039
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN HE GAVE IT TO YOU?

25:09.241 --> 25:11.077
DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW IT FELT

25:11.110 --> 25:12.945
WHEN YOU HELD HER
IN YOUR ARMS?

25:12.979 --> 25:14.213
- YOU STOP.

25:14.246 --> 25:18.050
YOU STOP TORTURING ME.

25:18.084 --> 25:23.990
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT HOW I FEEL.

25:27.594 --> 25:29.562
MAYBE I SHOULD
ASK FOR A LAWYER.

25:29.596 --> 25:32.298
- BUT WE'RE TALKING.
WHY DO YOU NEED A LAWYER?

25:32.331 --> 25:34.601
[knocking]

25:34.634 --> 25:37.737
- WHAT WAS THAT?

25:37.770 --> 25:39.572
IS THERE SOMEONE
WATCHING US?

25:39.606 --> 25:42.609
- JUST GIVE ME A MOMENT.

25:44.944 --> 25:46.779
WHY THE HELL DID YOU DO THAT?
I WAS JUST GETTING SOMEWHERE.

25:46.813 --> 25:49.949
- YOU CANNOT TELL HER
THAT SHE DOESN'T NEED A LAWYER.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.751
- WELL, WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES THAT MAKE?

25:51.784 --> 25:53.653
- IT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN GIVING US A CONFESSION

25:53.686 --> 25:55.121
THAT WE CAN USE IN COURT
AND ONE WE CAN'T.

25:55.154 --> 25:56.989
- BUT I'M A PSYCHIATRIST,
NOT A COP.

25:57.023 --> 25:58.925
- NO, YOU ARE AN AGENT
OF THE POLICE.

25:58.958 --> 26:00.827
AND ANYTHING THAT SHE SAYS
AFTER YOU TELL HER

26:00.860 --> 26:04.664
"YOU DON'T NEED A LAWYER,"
IS ILLEGALLY OBTAINED.

26:04.697 --> 26:06.699
- CAN SHE CHANGE HER MIND?

26:06.733 --> 26:08.801
LEGALLY?

26:10.269 --> 26:13.873
- YES.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.642
- OKAY.

26:17.977 --> 26:19.979
I'VE ENJOYED
TALKING WITH YOU, JUNE,

26:20.012 --> 26:22.114
BUT I'M AFRAID
WE'VE GOT TO STOP.

26:22.148 --> 26:23.783
- THEN I HAVE TO
TALK TO THEM.

26:23.816 --> 26:27.119
- YES.

26:27.153 --> 26:29.121
- NO.

26:29.155 --> 26:30.289
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO GO?

26:30.322 --> 26:32.925
- BECAUSE YOU ASKED ME
ABOUT A LAWYER.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.827
BUT I WISH YOU
ALL THE BEST.

26:34.861 --> 26:36.896
- IF--IF I SAY THAT

26:36.929 --> 26:39.165
I DON'T NEED A LAWYER,
CAN YOU STAY?

26:42.935 --> 26:45.004
- YES.

26:45.037 --> 26:48.040
- OKAY.
I DON'T NEED A LAWYER.

26:49.776 --> 26:52.779
I DON'T WANT THEM
WATCHING ME.

26:55.281 --> 26:58.350
- THEN COME
AND SIT OVER HERE.

27:00.920 --> 27:03.890
IF YOU SIT HERE, THEY
WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE YOU.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.398
YOU KNOW, YOU SAID THAT

27:12.431 --> 27:15.001
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL.

27:15.034 --> 27:16.202
WELL, YOU'RE WRONG.
I DO KNOW.

27:16.235 --> 27:20.106
I KNOW ABOUT
PAIN WITHIN FAMILIES.

27:21.808 --> 27:23.810
WHEN SHE WAS 16,

27:23.843 --> 27:27.146
MY DAUGHTER
STOPPED SPEAKING TO ME.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.381
FOR 20 YEARS...

27:29.415 --> 27:32.351
SHE HATED ME.

27:32.384 --> 27:35.154
MY LITTLE ANN.

27:35.187 --> 27:38.290
SHE WAS ABOUT YOUR AGE.

27:38.324 --> 27:42.128
- WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

27:42.161 --> 27:45.197
- SHE WAS ATTACKED

27:45.231 --> 27:49.936
BY SOMEBODY WHO WORKED
WITH ME.

27:49.969 --> 27:53.873
AND SHE DIED.

27:53.906 --> 27:56.108
- OH, MY GOD.

27:56.142 --> 27:59.045
WHY DID SHE
HATE YOU SO MUCH?

27:59.078 --> 28:01.080
- WELL,
WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER,

28:01.113 --> 28:06.318
I WAS ADDICTED
TO SEX AND ALCOHOL.

28:06.352 --> 28:10.022
- DID YOU DO
SOMETHING BAD TO HER?

28:10.056 --> 28:11.157
- AS IT TURNED OUT, NO.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.025
BUT...

28:13.059 --> 28:16.028
FOR 20 YEARS,
I THOUGHT I HAD.

28:16.062 --> 28:17.329
[sighs]

28:17.363 --> 28:19.365
NO ONE SHOULD HAVE
TO LIVE WITH SHAME LIKE THAT.

28:22.068 --> 28:25.071
SO I DO UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU FEEL.

28:31.077 --> 28:35.247
- ONE NIGHT
WHEN I WAS SEVEN, MY...

28:35.281 --> 28:38.350
MY DAD CAME
INTO MY ROOM AT BEDTIME.

28:40.086 --> 28:42.021
HE TOLD ME HOW SPECIAL I WAS.

28:42.054 --> 28:46.258
THAT...

28:46.292 --> 28:50.529
I WAS THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING IN HIS LIFE.

28:50.562 --> 28:54.333
AND HE WANTED
TO GIVE ME A PRESENT.

28:54.366 --> 28:58.370
HE GAVE ME THE--
THIS DOLL, AND...

28:58.404 --> 29:03.943
HE SAID THAT SHE
REMINDED HIM OF ME

29:03.976 --> 29:06.378
BECAUSE I WAS
HIS PERFECT LITTLE DOLL.

29:06.412 --> 29:10.149
AND THEN...
[sighs]

29:10.182 --> 29:13.252
- HE GOT
INTO BED WITH YOU.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.058
- UM...

29:19.091 --> 29:21.327
[sniffs]

29:21.360 --> 29:23.395
IT'S MY FAULT.
'CAUSE I KNEW.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.031
I KNEW IT WAS WRONG.

29:25.064 --> 29:27.934
BUT HE SAID
THAT WE COULDN'T--

29:27.967 --> 29:31.003
WE COULDN'T TELL ANYONE,
BECAUSE...

29:31.037 --> 29:35.174
BECAUSE
NO ONE WOULD UNDERSTAND.

29:35.207 --> 29:38.244
- YOU JUST WANTED TO
SHOW YOUR FATHER YOU LOVED HIM.

29:38.277 --> 29:44.050
YOU THOUGHT THAT IF YOU
COULD BE THE PERFECT LITTLE GIRL

29:44.083 --> 29:47.086
THAT HE'D STOP HURTING YOU.

29:50.522 --> 29:52.091
LIKE MARNIE.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.426
THE LITTLE GIRL
YOU WISHED YOU WERE.

29:57.463 --> 29:58.931
THAT'S WHY YOU HAD
TO GIVE HER THE DOLL

29:58.965 --> 30:01.968
TO KEEP HER SAFE.

30:04.270 --> 30:08.540
- [sniffs] THIS WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

30:08.574 --> 30:10.042
IT WASN'T.

30:10.076 --> 30:12.244
[sobbing]

30:12.278 --> 30:15.014
WHY DID...
WHY DID YOU COME TO MY HOUSE?

30:15.047 --> 30:18.550
I TOLD YOUR MOTHER
NOT TO SEND YOU,

30:18.584 --> 30:20.086
THAT YOU SHOULDN'T COME.

30:20.119 --> 30:22.922
YOU--YOU WOULD BE FINE

30:22.955 --> 30:25.257
IF YOU HADN'T COME
TO MY HOUSE.

30:25.291 --> 30:31.230
[breathing, crying]

30:31.263 --> 30:33.365
I ASKED HER IF
SHE WANTED A GLASS OF MILK

30:33.399 --> 30:35.534
BEFORE WE STARTED.
I PUT THE PILLS IN THE MILK.

30:35.567 --> 30:39.238
I...

30:39.271 --> 30:43.509
I-I-I GAVE IT TO HER
WHEN WE SAT DOWN AT THE PIANO

30:43.542 --> 30:46.378
AND...SHE STARTED
TO DRIFT OFF.

30:46.412 --> 30:48.014
AND THEN...

30:48.047 --> 30:50.149
- AND THEN YOU TOOK
THE WOODEN SPOON.

30:52.651 --> 30:55.021
- SHE CRIED.

30:55.054 --> 30:57.023
AND SAID THAT SHE WAS
GONNA TELL HER MOTHER.

30:57.056 --> 30:58.590
AND THAT'S WHEN I KNEW.

30:58.624 --> 31:02.461
I KNEW THAT I COULDN'T
LET HER WAKE UP.

31:02.494 --> 31:04.463
- SO YOU MADE HER
COMFORTABLE.

31:04.496 --> 31:08.534
- I GOT THE PILLOW,
AND I GOT THE SHEETS,

31:08.567 --> 31:13.372
AND I--I WRAPPED HER UP,
AND SHE WAS COZY, AND...

31:13.405 --> 31:15.407
I PUT THE DOLL IN THERE

31:15.441 --> 31:17.910
SO THAT SHE WOULDN'T
BE ALONE, AND...

31:17.944 --> 31:20.412
- AND THEN YOU LEFT HER
WHERE GOD WOULD FIND HER.

31:20.446 --> 31:23.315
- [whimpering]
I'M SORRY.

31:23.349 --> 31:27.053
I'M SORRY.
MARNIE, I'M SO SORRY.

31:27.086 --> 31:30.056
I'M SO SORRY.
I'M...

31:30.089 --> 31:32.925
[sobbing]
SO SORRY.

31:36.462 --> 31:37.263
- I CALLED THE A.D.A.

31:37.296 --> 31:38.630
AND TOLD HER
YOU GOT THE CONFESSION.

31:38.664 --> 31:40.366
SHE SAID TO GET
JUNE INTO THE SYSTEM

31:40.399 --> 31:42.234
AS QUICK AS WE CAN.

31:42.268 --> 31:43.635
- SO WHAT NOW?

31:43.669 --> 31:46.372
- SHE'LL BE BOOKED, ARRAIGNED,
AND SENT TO JAIL.

31:46.405 --> 31:47.673
- JAIL?

31:47.706 --> 31:49.475
SHE'S STILL LIKELY
TO TRY AND KILL HERSELF.

31:49.508 --> 31:52.311
- WE'LL PUT HER ON
SUICIDE WATCH.

31:52.344 --> 31:53.679
YOU DID A GOOD JOB
IN THERE, BY THE WAY.

31:53.712 --> 31:56.348
- WANNA STAY
HERE PERMANENT, DOC?

31:56.382 --> 31:57.716
WE COULD
USE A GUY LIKE YOU.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.385
- [crying]
DEAR LORD...

31:59.418 --> 32:02.288
PLEASE HEAR ME WHEN
I ASK YOU TO FORGIVE ME

32:02.321 --> 32:04.490
FOR WHAT I HAVE DONE.

32:04.523 --> 32:08.360
MY MISTAKES,
MY SELFISHNESS.

32:08.394 --> 32:11.297
PLEASE HEAR ME
WHEN I ASK YOU

32:11.330 --> 32:14.366
TO COMFORT
MARNIE'S PRECIOUS SOUL,

32:14.400 --> 32:17.169
AND THE SOULS OF THOSE

32:17.203 --> 32:19.605
THAT NEEDED MY COMFORT

32:19.638 --> 32:22.408
AND PROTECTION
THAT I COULDN'T GIVE THEM.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.742
[crying]

32:23.775 --> 32:26.212
- "ALL OF THOSE THAT
NEEDED COMFORT AND PROTECTION?"

32:26.245 --> 32:27.513
- TALKING
ABOUT MARNIE'S MURDER

32:27.546 --> 32:30.549
MAY HAVE
TRIGGERED HER MEMORY.

32:32.784 --> 32:36.288
- SHE'S CONFESSING
TO MORE VICTIMS?

32:36.322 --> 32:38.324
- HOW MANY LIVES HAS
SHE RUINED?

32:38.357 --> 32:41.127
- LET'S INTERVIEW
HER OTHER STUDENTS.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.362
MM, NEIGHBORS, TOO.

32:43.395 --> 32:46.332
- I ONLY TAKE PIANO
BECAUSE MY PARENTS MAKE ME.

32:46.365 --> 32:47.433
I'D RATHER LEARN GUITAR,

32:47.466 --> 32:49.368
BUT MS. FRYE'S
ALWAYS NICE TO ME.

32:49.401 --> 32:50.269
- I LOVE MS. FRYE.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.371
SHE SAYS I'M
THE BEST STUDENT SHE HAS.

32:52.404 --> 32:54.273
- HURT ME?
NO WAY.

32:54.306 --> 32:55.507
MS. FRYE IS GREAT.

32:55.541 --> 32:57.476
- JUNE TRIED
TO TEACH ME TO PLAY,

32:57.509 --> 32:58.177
BUT I
WAS NEVER ANY GOOD.

32:58.210 --> 32:59.478
SO AFTER A WHILE
I JUST QUIT

32:59.511 --> 33:01.480
TO HANG OUT
WITH MY FRIENDS.

33:01.513 --> 33:03.215
- SHE EVER MAKE
YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE?

33:03.249 --> 33:04.016
- ONLY THE OTHER NIGHT,

33:04.050 --> 33:06.085
LIKE, WHEN
SHE TOTALLY BLEW ME OFF.

33:06.118 --> 33:08.320
- WHICH NIGHT?
- IT WAS MONDAY.

33:08.354 --> 33:10.356
MY MOM CALLED, AND
SHE SAID I HAD TO GET HOME

33:10.389 --> 33:12.624
'CAUSE THAT GIRL GOT KIDNAPPED
A COUPLE BLOCKS OVER.

33:12.658 --> 33:14.426
- RIGHT.
- SO, LIKE, I'M COMING DOWN

33:14.460 --> 33:16.095
THE SIDEWALK,
AND THERE'S JUNE.

33:16.128 --> 33:18.097
AND SHE'S ARGUING
WITH SOME OLD LADY.

33:18.130 --> 33:21.400
AND I SAID "HI,"
AND SHE TOTALLY IGNORED ME.

33:21.433 --> 33:23.269
- OLD LADY?
- YEAH.

33:23.302 --> 33:25.037
SHE WAS,
LIKE, MY GRANDMA'S AGE.

33:25.071 --> 33:26.705
SHE HAD A CANE, TOO.

33:26.738 --> 33:29.408
SO, LIKE, SHE GOES
LIMPING UP THE STOOP WITH JUNE,

33:29.441 --> 33:32.444
AND I'M, LIKE,
"WHATEVER, LATER."

33:33.479 --> 33:35.081
- IT WAS JUNE'S MOTHER.

33:35.114 --> 33:36.782
- JUNE SAID HER PARENTS
DIED WHEN SHE WAS 17.

33:36.815 --> 33:40.452
- THE FATHER DID,
THE MOTHER REMARRIED.

33:40.486 --> 33:43.555
ELAINE FRYE CAVANAUGH
IS ALIVE AND IN BROOKLYN.

33:43.589 --> 33:45.357
- WELL, WELL, WELL...
HOW'D YOU GET THAT?

33:45.391 --> 33:46.792
- I RAN HER NAME
THROUGH THE SYSTEM,

33:46.825 --> 33:49.461
THINKING THAT I WOULD FIND
AN AUNT OR AN OLDER COUSIN

33:49.495 --> 33:51.363
WITH A LIMP.
UP POPPED MOM HERSELF.

33:51.397 --> 33:53.132
- LEGAL CLERK
FOR OVER 30 YEARS.

33:53.165 --> 33:54.800
AND THERE YOU GO,
WENT ON DISABILITY IN '04,

33:54.833 --> 33:56.502
WHEN SHE SLIPPED AND
BROKE HER LEG IN BOROUGH HALL.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.604
- BUT WHY WOULD JUNE SAY
HER MOTHER'S DEAD?

33:58.637 --> 34:00.306
- WELL, YOU'RE THE SHRINK,

34:00.339 --> 34:01.807
I FIGURED YOU'D KNOCK
THAT ONE OUT OF THE PARK.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.375
- 'CAUSE SHE WANTED
HER MOTHER DEAD...

34:03.409 --> 34:07.213
- FOR NOT PROTECTING HER
FROM HER FATHER'S ABUSE.

34:07.246 --> 34:09.515
- FOR ABUSING HER
HERSELF?

34:09.548 --> 34:11.517
- YOU THINK THAT ELAINE
MOLESTED JUNE?

34:11.550 --> 34:13.119
- SOME GIRLS
ABUSED BY THEIR MOTHERS

34:13.152 --> 34:14.386
DO SAY THEIR FATHERS DID IT,

34:14.420 --> 34:16.855
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FACE
THE REALITY.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.390
- AND BECAUSE
NO ONE CAN BELIEVE

34:18.424 --> 34:21.093
THAT A MOTHER COULD
ABUSE HER OWN DAUGHTER.

34:21.127 --> 34:22.494
- YOU KNOW, I'M BEGINNING
TO THINK WE GOT THIS BACKWARDS.

34:22.528 --> 34:24.396
JUNE DID NOT CALL MOM OVER

34:24.430 --> 34:27.466
TO HELP DISPOSE OF THE BODY.

34:27.499 --> 34:29.801
HOW ABOUT MOM WAS ALREADY THERE
WHEN MARNIE CAME OVER?

34:29.835 --> 34:33.539
- JUNE'S MOTHER
KILLED MARNIE.

34:35.641 --> 34:37.509
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

34:37.543 --> 34:39.245
SINCE WHEN IS IT A SIN
FOR A MOTHER

34:39.278 --> 34:40.512
TO VISIT
HER DAUGHTER'S HOUSE?

34:40.546 --> 34:42.514
- WELL, IT'S
A SIN FOR JUNE TO LIE

34:42.548 --> 34:44.516
AND TELL EVERYBODY THAT
YOU'RE DEAD.

34:44.550 --> 34:47.486
- [chuckles]
JUNE SAYS I'M DEAD?

34:47.519 --> 34:48.787
- WHY IS THAT FUNNY?
- IT'S TYPICAL.

34:48.820 --> 34:51.523
SILLY JUNE,
HEAD IN THE CLOUDS.

34:51.557 --> 34:54.293
ROGER LET HER GET AWAY
WITH IT FOR YEARS.

34:54.326 --> 34:57.263
- YOUR FIRST HUSBAND?
- YES.

34:57.296 --> 34:59.465
I TRIED TO INSTILL
DISCIPLINE IN JUNE.

34:59.498 --> 35:02.501
DO WELL IN SCHOOL,
PRACTICE YOUR PIANO.

35:02.534 --> 35:04.736
AND ROGER WOULD
COME RIGHT ALONG BEHIND ME

35:04.770 --> 35:08.374
AND SPOIL HER WITH
CANDY AND SLEEPOVERS.

35:08.407 --> 35:09.641
THAT'S WHY I DIVORCED HIM.

35:09.675 --> 35:11.443
- YEAH, WELL, IT'S
A TOUGH WORLD OUT THERE,

35:11.477 --> 35:12.878
YOU CAN'T SCREW AROUND.

35:12.911 --> 35:14.280
- CLEARLY YOU HAVE CHILDREN.

35:14.313 --> 35:15.881
- I'VE GOT FIVE.

35:15.914 --> 35:18.517
- THEN YOU KNOW PERFECTION
ISN'T EASILY ATTAINED.

35:18.550 --> 35:20.352
- AND YOUR CURRENT HUSBAND?

35:20.386 --> 35:21.887
DID HE DEMAND PERFECTION
FROM JUNE, TOO?

35:21.920 --> 35:23.355
- GRANT?

35:23.389 --> 35:25.624
HE'S NOT CURRENT.
HE DIED LAST YEAR.

35:25.657 --> 35:28.160
AND WAS JUST AS WEAK
AND USELESS AS ROGER.

35:28.194 --> 35:29.861
- SO YOU HAD
TO BE THE DISCIPLINARIAN.

35:29.895 --> 35:32.598
- I WAS ALWAYS FAIR.
BUT FIRM.

35:32.631 --> 35:35.167
- BUT WHEN YOUR KIDS ACT UP,
NOTHING FIXES THEM FASTER

35:35.201 --> 35:36.402
THAN THE HANDLE OF
A SPOON, HUH?

35:38.337 --> 35:40.339
- YOU'LL HAVE TO
TELL ME WHAT THAT MEANS.

35:40.372 --> 35:41.373
- PUT IT THIS WAY.

35:41.407 --> 35:43.475
YOU WEREN'T TEACHING JUNE
HOW TO BAKE COOKIES.

35:43.509 --> 35:45.511
- OR MARNIE FOSTER,
FOR THAT MATTER.

35:45.544 --> 35:48.880
- THE GIRL?
THE ONE WHO DIED?

35:48.914 --> 35:50.382
- DON'T PRETEND
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO SHE IS.

35:50.416 --> 35:51.317
- WHAT ARE
YOU ACCUSING ME OF?

35:51.350 --> 35:53.419
- WHY'D YOU GO
TO JUNE'S HOUSE ON MONDAY?

35:53.452 --> 35:56.322
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T
REALLY SOUND

35:56.355 --> 35:57.456
LIKE SHE LOVED MOMMY
ALL THAT MUCH.

35:57.489 --> 36:00.959
- DON'T PRESUME TO KNOW
HOW MY DAUGHTER FEELS ABOUT ME.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.861
- NOW WHAT'S PRESUMPTUOUS
IS AFTER THE HORROR

36:02.894 --> 36:04.296
THAT YOU PUT HER THROUGH

36:04.330 --> 36:05.831
THAT YOU MADE HER
CLEAN UP YOUR MESS.

36:05.864 --> 36:07.833
- I DO NOT MAKE MESSES.

36:07.866 --> 36:09.501
- WHAT HAPPENED WITH
MARNIE?

36:09.535 --> 36:10.402
DID YOU GIVE HER
THE SPOON TREATMENT

36:10.436 --> 36:11.503
THE WAY YOU DID JUNE?

36:11.537 --> 36:13.272
- GET OUT, BOTH OF YOU.

36:13.305 --> 36:14.740
- YOU DRUG HER, SODOMIZE,
AND SMOTHER HER?

36:14.773 --> 36:15.941
- GET OUT!

36:15.974 --> 36:17.309
I'M CALLING MY LAWYER.

36:17.343 --> 36:18.777
- AND THEN YOU ABUSED JUNE
ONE MORE TIME

36:18.810 --> 36:20.712
BY MAKING HER
DUMP THE GIRL'S BODY

36:20.746 --> 36:21.880
IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH.

36:21.913 --> 36:23.682
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- [sighs]

36:23.715 --> 36:25.417
KATIE...

36:25.451 --> 36:26.918
TELL THEM
WHERE I WAS MONDAY.

36:26.952 --> 36:28.920
TELL THEM
HOW I GOT THERE.

36:28.954 --> 36:31.723
- M-M-MOM HAD
A BRIDGE TOURNAMENT

36:31.757 --> 36:33.925
U-U-UP IN STANFORD.

36:33.959 --> 36:36.428
I DROVE HER UP
AND DROPPED HER OFF.

36:36.462 --> 36:37.496
- YOU HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS?

36:37.529 --> 36:39.865
- ONE BY ROGER,
ONE BY GRANT.

36:39.898 --> 36:41.600
IS THAT A CRIME?

36:41.633 --> 36:43.502
- WHAT DO YOU PEOPLE WANT?

36:43.535 --> 36:45.271
[crying]
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

36:45.304 --> 36:46.672
- NOBODY SAID YOU DID.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.507
- KATIE,
SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

36:48.540 --> 36:49.975
- NO, KATIE, KEEP TALKING.

36:50.008 --> 36:52.444
- YOU DON'T NEED
TO BE HERE.

36:52.478 --> 36:54.646
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND,
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!

36:54.680 --> 36:56.715
- KATIE!

36:56.748 --> 36:59.751
- NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

37:01.787 --> 37:02.988
- KATIE?

37:03.021 --> 37:06.224
- [muffled sobs]

37:12.298 --> 37:14.466
- KATIE?

37:14.500 --> 37:15.501
COME ON OUT, HONEY.

37:15.534 --> 37:18.537
COME ON.

37:19.505 --> 37:21.273
- [crying]

37:21.307 --> 37:22.641
- WHY ARE YOU
RUNNING AWAY FROM US?

37:22.674 --> 37:24.009
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

37:24.042 --> 37:27.313
- KATIE...
IS THIS YOUR BEDROOM?

37:27.346 --> 37:30.015
- YES.

37:30.048 --> 37:31.417
- LEAVE
MY LITTLE GIRL ALONE.

37:31.450 --> 37:34.453
GET OUT OF MY BEDROOM.

37:36.555 --> 37:38.590
- YOUR BEDROOM?

37:38.624 --> 37:41.627
SHE JUST SAID
IT WAS HERS.

37:45.531 --> 37:48.567
- OH, MY GOD.

37:50.902 --> 37:53.772
- WHY DID YOU COME?

37:53.805 --> 37:54.973
I TOLD YOU EVERYTHING.

37:55.006 --> 37:56.508
- EXCEPT THE TRUTH.

37:56.542 --> 37:58.444
- YOU DON'T
BELONG IN HERE, JUNE.

37:58.477 --> 37:59.478
YOU NEVER DID.

37:59.511 --> 38:01.613
- GUARD!

38:01.647 --> 38:03.349
- TAKE ME BACK!

38:03.382 --> 38:04.983
- THE ONLY PLACE
YOU'RE GOING IS HOME.

38:05.016 --> 38:07.419
- NO, I DID
A TERRIBLE THING THERE.

38:07.453 --> 38:10.622
- WE KNOW.
YOU PUT MARNIE IN THE DUFFLE.

38:10.656 --> 38:12.023
BUT YOU DIDN'T KILL HER.

38:12.057 --> 38:14.460
- WHAT YOU DID,
YOU DID OUT OF LOVE.

38:14.493 --> 38:17.696
TO REPAY SOME DEBT YOU
NEVER OWED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

38:17.729 --> 38:20.532
- JUNE?

38:20.566 --> 38:23.569
WHY DID YOU TELL THEM?

38:23.602 --> 38:26.438
- I DIDN'T.
I DIDN'T.

38:26.472 --> 38:29.441
I DIDN'T, KATIE.
I PROMISE.

38:29.475 --> 38:33.044
- IT'S OKAY, JUNE.
- NO, IT'S NOT OKAY.

38:33.078 --> 38:34.980
I'M SO SORRY!

38:35.013 --> 38:38.316
MOMMY WASN'T HURTING ME
ANYMORE, AND I--

38:39.117 --> 38:41.420
I LEFT YOU.

38:41.453 --> 38:42.721
I LEFT YOU.

38:42.754 --> 38:44.523
I LEFT YOU ALONE WITH HER,

38:44.556 --> 38:47.058
AND I SHOULD'VE STAYED
TO PROTECT YOU.

38:47.092 --> 38:49.428
- JUNE, YOU CANNOT
BLAME YOURSELF.

38:49.461 --> 38:50.295
YOU WERE A VICTIM.

38:50.328 --> 38:53.432
YOUR MOTHER DID
TERRIBLE THINGS TO YOU.

38:53.465 --> 38:55.534
- COME ON.

38:55.567 --> 38:57.903
NONE OF THIS IS
YOUR FAULT.

38:57.936 --> 38:59.538
JUNE, LISTEN TO ME.

38:59.571 --> 39:04.042
NONE OF THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

39:04.075 --> 39:07.913
IS IT, KATIE?

39:07.946 --> 39:12.017
- I TOLD JUNE THAT
I WAS GONNA GO TO HER HOUSE

39:12.050 --> 39:16.021
AND SHE SAID THAT
SHE WOULD BE OUT FOR A WHILE,

39:16.054 --> 39:20.459
AND THAT I SHOULD
LET MYSELF IN WITH MY KEY.

39:20.492 --> 39:21.693
AND...

39:21.727 --> 39:23.629
AND SHE SAID
THAT SHE HAD CANCELLED

39:23.662 --> 39:26.498
HER FIRST PIANO LESSON.

39:26.532 --> 39:30.669
BUT WHEN I GOT THERE,
THE LITTLE STUDENT

39:30.702 --> 39:33.439
WAS...ON THE PORCH.

39:33.472 --> 39:35.641
- MARNIE?
MARNIE FOSTER?

39:35.674 --> 39:37.576
- YES.

39:37.609 --> 39:41.980
I'D SEEN HER BEFORE
HAVING HER LESSONS, AND...

39:45.116 --> 39:49.421
WE WENT INSIDE.
AND SHE WAS SO CUTE.

39:49.455 --> 39:52.624
SO INNOCENT AND SWEET.

39:52.658 --> 39:56.628
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY,

39:56.662 --> 39:58.864
BUT SUDDENLY...

39:58.897 --> 40:02.868
I ASKED HER IF I COULD
TAKE HER CLOTHES OFF.

40:02.901 --> 40:08.039
AND, UM...

40:08.073 --> 40:11.076
SHE SAID "NO,"
AND SHE TRIED TO LEAVE.

40:16.147 --> 40:18.884
AND, UM...

40:18.917 --> 40:20.919
THAT'S WHEN GOT REAL MAD.

40:24.122 --> 40:26.057
BUT I DIDN'T WANT HER
TO FEEL BAD,

40:26.091 --> 40:29.094
SO I WENT INTO THE KITCHEN,

40:29.127 --> 40:31.763
AND I GOT SOME OF...

40:31.797 --> 40:34.633
THE PILLS,
THE ONES THAT JUNE USES

40:34.666 --> 40:36.134
TO GO TO SLEEP WITH.

40:36.167 --> 40:39.137
- AND WHAT ELSE DID
YOU GET FROM THE KITCHEN?

40:39.170 --> 40:41.840
- THE SPOON.
- THE WOODEN SPOON?

40:41.873 --> 40:45.777
- LIKE THE ONE
THAT MY MOM USES.

40:45.811 --> 40:49.481
AND THEN JUNE CAME HOME,

40:49.515 --> 40:54.185
AND SHE SAW
WHAT I HAD DONE.

40:54.219 --> 40:55.954
- PLEASE...

40:55.987 --> 40:59.558
I DON'T WANNA LISTEN
ANYMORE.

40:59.591 --> 41:01.527
- JUNE, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO TESTIFY

41:01.560 --> 41:05.063
AGAINST YOUR HALF-SISTER
ABOUT THE ABUSE SHE ENDURED.

41:05.096 --> 41:08.133
AND ALSO
ABOUT YOUR OWN ABUSE.

41:08.166 --> 41:09.868
- WILL IT KEEP HER
FROM GOING TO PRISON?

41:09.901 --> 41:14.139
- KATIE WILL BE SENT
TO A PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY.

41:14.172 --> 41:16.875
- WE'LL DO EVERYTHING
WE CAN TO HELP HER.

41:16.908 --> 41:20.211
BUT SHE'LL NEVER
BE FREE AGAIN.

41:20.245 --> 41:21.947
- WHAT ABOUT MY MOTHER?

41:21.980 --> 41:24.683
- THERE WAS ONLY ONE BED
IN THE APARTMENT

41:24.716 --> 41:26.051
THAT KATIE
SHARED WITH HER,

41:26.084 --> 41:28.554
SO YOUR MOTHER
WILL BE GOING TO JAIL

41:28.587 --> 41:29.721
FOR THE ONGOING ABUSE.

41:29.755 --> 41:32.624
- JUNE?

41:35.060 --> 41:38.997
JUNE.

41:39.030 --> 41:41.933
I STILL LOVE YOU.

41:41.967 --> 41:46.004
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE
MY SISTER.

41:46.037 --> 41:47.272
- [whispers]
KATIE.

41:47.305 --> 41:51.610
- CAN YOU SIT DOWN
AND TALK WITH ME SOME MORE?

41:51.643 --> 41:53.311
CAN YOU DO THAT?

41:53.344 --> 41:56.314
- [sobbing]
- OKAY, COME ON.

41:56.347 --> 41:58.950
- I LET MY WHOLE FAMILY
BE DESTROYED.

41:58.984 --> 42:03.855
HOW CAN I FORGIVE MYSELF?

42:03.889 --> 42:08.126
- YOU CAN START...

42:08.159 --> 42:11.262
BY LETTING ME HELP YOU TRY.

42:11.296 --> 42:14.265
HMM?

42:14.299 --> 42:17.302
