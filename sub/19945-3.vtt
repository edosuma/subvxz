Ready?

00:51.618 --> 00:52.452
Here we go.

00:54.788 --> 00:58.459
Behold. The Ménage à Moi.

00:58.542 --> 01:00.085
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

01:00.169 --> 01:02.045
And so light.

01:02.129 --> 01:04.214
It's like I'm holding a cloud.

01:04.298 --> 01:07.217
Yeah, that can vibrate
and give you orgasms.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.177
Mmm.

01:08.260 --> 01:12.347
Oh, my God, the glow-in-the-dark
control buttons were a great idea.

01:12.431 --> 01:13.474
Thank you.

01:13.557 --> 01:19.438
And can we talk about this soft-grip gel
sleeve, Ms. Stroke-of-Friggin'-Genius?

01:19.521 --> 01:21.982
Look how easily the angles change.

01:22.065 --> 01:23.317
Mmm.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.776
Oh, we did this, Frankie.

01:24.860 --> 01:27.154
We said we were gonna do it
and we did it.

01:27.237 --> 01:29.656
Yeah! Thanks to Jacob.

01:29.740 --> 01:30.616
What did he do?

01:31.617 --> 01:34.786
[gasps] Oh, yeah! Mr. Money Bags.

01:34.870 --> 01:36.705
Have you talked to him yet
about the terms of the loan?

01:36.788 --> 01:38.582
Of course I did.

01:38.665 --> 01:40.334
And what are they?

01:40.417 --> 01:43.462
It's... you know... 72.

01:43.962 --> 01:46.048
As in, percent? As in, interest?

01:46.131 --> 01:48.967
It's an FDA glass-ceiling mortgage.

01:49.051 --> 01:50.844
It's all FICA, Grace.

01:52.679 --> 01:54.890
Okay, I better call him myself.

01:54.973 --> 01:56.433
No!

01:56.517 --> 01:58.227
I'll walk you through it later.

01:58.310 --> 02:00.521
We've got a prototype to try out.

02:00.604 --> 02:04.900
What do you say we give these bad boys
a trial run and then compare notes?

02:04.983 --> 02:07.611
Here? In the same room?

02:07.694 --> 02:10.531
No. Not in the same room.

02:10.614 --> 02:13.408
I mean, I'm open to it,
if that's your jam.

02:13.492 --> 02:16.787
That is not my jam.
Nothing could be further from my jam.

02:17.287 --> 02:18.330
Then, how about this?

02:18.413 --> 02:20.666
I do it whenever, you do it whenever,

02:20.749 --> 02:22.459
and then we meet up whenever.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.378
That's more my jam.

02:25.087 --> 02:27.130
-It's pretty exciting, huh?
-Yeah.

02:27.214 --> 02:29.675
-[soft whirring]
-Oh, it's so quiet.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.847
God. You know what I just thought?

02:35.931 --> 02:39.434
Wow. I have not spoken
to my cousin since...

02:40.060 --> 02:41.770
a very long time.

02:41.853 --> 02:44.106
You know, maybe I should call her now,

02:44.189 --> 02:46.108
you know, while I'm thinking about it.

02:51.321 --> 02:53.782
Let's call my cousin too.

02:54.616 --> 02:55.742
Hello.

02:55.826 --> 02:57.536
[chuckles]

03:00.539 --> 03:02.207
Good morning.

03:03.458 --> 03:05.043
Good morning.

03:05.961 --> 03:08.714
So, did you get in touch with your cousin?

03:08.797 --> 03:10.340
I did.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.509
We had a very satisfying conversation.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.679
I'm going to make a point
of calling more often.

03:15.762 --> 03:20.183
Just between you and me, that thing
could give Jacob a run for his money.

03:20.267 --> 03:22.686
He can't change angles as quickly.

03:22.769 --> 03:24.396
And mama's got angles.

03:24.479 --> 03:25.397
Look.

03:26.440 --> 03:29.192
It didn't aggravate my arthritis one bit!

03:29.276 --> 03:33.238
The Ménage à Moi,
it works<i> très magnifique.</i>

03:33.322 --> 03:36.950
Orgasms and pancakes with all the fixings!

03:37.034 --> 03:38.577
Best day ever.

03:39.494 --> 03:41.997
So when does the money truck pull up?

03:42.080 --> 03:45.083
Whoa, slow down. It doesn't matter
that we know it's great.

03:45.167 --> 03:48.170
We gotta have other women try it
and give us feedback.

03:48.253 --> 03:50.672
But we don't have a budget
for focus groups.

03:50.756 --> 03:53.216
-I could call a few of my friends.
-[sputters]

03:53.675 --> 03:55.510
No. I know your friends.

03:56.678 --> 03:58.055
Get them all together in a room

03:58.138 --> 04:02.851
and we'd end up with a doobie-smoking
vibrator orgy on our hands.

04:02.934 --> 04:05.646
You don't smoke during an orgy.
Use your head.

04:05.729 --> 04:09.441
It has to be an impartial group.
We need unbiased opinions.

04:09.524 --> 04:11.234
Where do we find those women?

04:11.318 --> 04:16.031
Hang out at HomeTown Buffet and hand them
out to older women at the soft serve bar?

04:16.114 --> 04:20.577
Which is delicious, by the way,
but strangely small cones.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.079
You remember Arlene, don't you?

04:22.162 --> 04:25.332
Sure. She was one of the mean girls
you used to hang out with.

04:25.415 --> 04:28.543
Arlene was never mean.
I always thought of her

04:28.627 --> 04:31.713
like one of those sweet birds
that lives on the back of a crocodile.

04:31.797 --> 04:35.676
Don't disparage crocodiles by comparing
them to old Puss Face and the gang.

04:35.759 --> 04:37.803
She doesn't see Puss Face anymore.

04:37.886 --> 04:41.348
She's joined a women's social group
called The Daytimers.

04:41.431 --> 04:45.143
They meet once a week for lunch. You know,
go on field trips, that sort of thing.

04:45.227 --> 04:47.521
Hmm. Sounds like our target market.

04:47.604 --> 04:48.939
Target market?

04:49.022 --> 04:51.441
You've been tossing around
fancy terms lately.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.318
I googled "business words."

04:53.402 --> 04:55.779
If I'm gonna be taken seriously
as an entrepreneur,

04:55.862 --> 04:57.989
I should start sounding like one.

04:58.073 --> 05:00.409
Hostile takeover. Vested interest.

05:00.492 --> 05:01.618
File not found.

05:04.121 --> 05:06.498
Where are the jelly beans?

05:06.581 --> 05:10.419
You finished them with your eggs
yesterday, but I have gummy bears.

05:11.294 --> 05:14.131
Who puts gummy bears on pancakes?

05:14.631 --> 05:16.174
[Peter] <i>God. Okay. Enough.</i>

05:16.258 --> 05:18.802
This little piggy is done.

05:18.885 --> 05:20.137
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

05:20.220 --> 05:22.764
Sol's become quite the pizza maven.

05:25.016 --> 05:29.271
He's even managed to make my special
whole-wheat, low-fat, gluten-free,

05:29.354 --> 05:33.316
soy cheese pizza taste quite... terrible!

05:33.400 --> 05:35.610
It's still terrible!

05:37.028 --> 05:39.739
Look at you two. So happy.

05:39.823 --> 05:43.076
And why not? A beautiful, new home.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.954
And retirement, what,
just around the corner?

05:46.037 --> 05:47.956
I wouldn't say around the corner.

05:48.039 --> 05:49.791
I've rounded the corner and parked.

05:49.875 --> 05:52.627
I'm really confused about this corner now.

05:52.711 --> 05:56.465
We're gonna get Bud up to speed
before we turn the firm over completely.

05:56.548 --> 05:59.426
Sol goes in three days a week
and I don't go in at all.

05:59.509 --> 06:02.095
Sounds like someone's
just dragging his huaraches.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.223
I'm this close to convincing him.

06:05.307 --> 06:10.937
You need to be to convinced to retire?
All I've ever wanted to be is retired.

06:11.021 --> 06:15.609
Whenever I see a Walmart greeter,
I think: "Lucky bastard."

06:15.692 --> 06:18.403
Robert's been bribing me
with promises of traveling.

06:18.487 --> 06:21.156
We've never even been to Gettysburg.
Can you believe that?

06:21.239 --> 06:22.240
I was thinking Spain,

06:22.324 --> 06:28.747
but a blood-soaked battlefield haunted
with memories of dead boys could be fun.

06:28.830 --> 06:29.789
[laughs]

06:29.873 --> 06:35.086
Speaking of wars,
did I mention that I'm directing<i> 1776?</i>

06:35.170 --> 06:36.254
What? Where?

06:36.338 --> 06:38.798
At the New Lear Community Theatre
of La Jolla.

06:38.882 --> 06:42.969
I love<i> 1776!</i>
Sol, tell him how much I love<i> 1776.</i>

06:43.053 --> 06:45.347
He loves<i> 1776.</i>

06:45.430 --> 06:47.807
<i>♪ I say vote yes ♪</i>

06:47.891 --> 06:49.434
<i>♪ Vote yes ♪</i>

06:49.518 --> 06:52.646
<i>♪ Vote for independency ♪</i>

06:54.397 --> 06:57.484
Robert! I didn't know you could sing.

06:57.567 --> 06:59.402
You have a very good voice.

06:59.986 --> 07:01.530
Did you know he could sing like that?

07:01.613 --> 07:05.992
Oh, sure. When we go out in the car,
he always puts on the show-tunes station.

07:06.076 --> 07:09.120
Makes it impossible to carry on
a conversation.

07:09.204 --> 07:11.665
And sometimes I want
to jump out the window.

07:11.748 --> 07:14.417
But he does have an excellent voice.

07:14.501 --> 07:16.336
Robert, you have to audition.

07:16.419 --> 07:19.339
-Oh, no, I don't think so.
-I'm serious.

07:19.422 --> 07:21.925
The same people get cast over and over.

07:22.008 --> 07:26.471
Some of them are tired
and not good, and I hate them.

07:26.555 --> 07:31.393
I love musical theater, but I don't think
that I could ever actually perform.

07:31.476 --> 07:33.854
Stop it. You'd be terrific.

07:33.937 --> 07:36.356
Sol, I want you to come audition, too.

07:36.439 --> 07:38.650
Both of you say that you will, right now.

07:38.733 --> 07:40.193
Me? Oh, no.

07:40.277 --> 07:44.197
Thanks for asking, but I don't really
think of myself as much of an actor.

07:46.408 --> 07:48.869
Didn't you two act straight for decades?

07:52.205 --> 07:55.208
Sol, maybe we should audition.

08:05.010 --> 08:07.387
Ah, "Hickory...

08:07.470 --> 08:10.724
lends a traditional smoky flavor
and classic aroma."

08:10.807 --> 08:14.436
Move over, mesquite. Looks like
you're not the only game in Pizzatown.

08:14.519 --> 08:16.980
Want to come with me on a hickory hunt?

08:17.063 --> 08:18.064
How could I not?

08:19.024 --> 08:19.858
Guess what?

08:20.817 --> 08:22.903
We're auditioning for<i> 1776.</i>

08:22.986 --> 08:24.070
What?

08:24.154 --> 08:27.741
You have only to prepare a song. I just
signed us up on the New Lear website.

08:27.824 --> 08:29.993
I'm gonna do "The Impossible Dream."

08:30.076 --> 08:33.079
Robert, I don't know,
it's a little out of my comfort zone.

08:33.163 --> 08:34.706
Isn't that the reason to do it?

08:34.789 --> 08:37.876
To do the things we've never done?
Come on. Let's have an adventure.

08:37.959 --> 08:41.546
You have talked about
widening our social circle.

08:41.630 --> 08:44.966
That's right. And you know,
theater folk are an interesting bunch.

08:45.050 --> 08:46.927
Entertaining, creative types.

08:47.010 --> 08:48.219
Left-brained.

08:48.303 --> 08:50.305
And more fun than our old lawyer friends.

08:50.388 --> 08:53.683
Big drinkers, the theater crowd.
Big, big drinkers.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.352
They celebrate life.

08:55.435 --> 08:58.563
You know, I was in<i> Carousel</i>
in junior high.

08:58.647 --> 09:00.649
-I didn't know that.
-Oh, yes.

09:00.732 --> 09:02.734
I played Enoch Snow, Jr.

09:02.817 --> 09:05.570
Very small role,
but everyone said I stood out.

09:05.654 --> 09:08.490
It might have been
because I was 14 and six feet tall,

09:08.573 --> 09:10.784
but I remember the experience fondly.

09:12.118 --> 09:15.580
Maybe it's time
to trod the boards again.

09:15.664 --> 09:17.248
-That's the spirit!
-[gasps]

09:18.166 --> 09:20.543
I know exactly
what I'm going to sing for my audition.

09:21.378 --> 09:23.254
"Leaving on a Fast Train."

09:24.839 --> 09:25.757
Jet plane.

09:26.341 --> 09:27.509
No, a fast train.

09:30.637 --> 09:34.265
Grace, it is so sweet of you and Frankie
to have us all over.

09:34.349 --> 09:36.643
Coming to the beach is such a treat.

09:37.352 --> 09:41.356
And we're all so curious
about this business you two are starting.

09:41.439 --> 09:44.359
We're so excited to hear
what all of you think about it.

09:44.526 --> 09:45.902
Okay, ladies.

09:46.403 --> 09:49.614
If you all will take a seat,
make yourselves comfortable,

09:49.698 --> 09:50.824
we can get started.

09:50.907 --> 09:55.453
Frankie and I really appreciate
your coming out here today.

09:55.537 --> 09:57.998
We just can't wait to tell you
what we've been up to.

09:58.081 --> 10:00.500
-Excuse me, Grace?
-Yes?

10:00.583 --> 10:02.919
Before you begin,
I'd like to ask everyone to stand

10:03.503 --> 10:07.549
and join hands as we bow our heads
and thank the Lord

10:07.632 --> 10:10.677
for bringing us together
on this beautiful day.

10:10.760 --> 10:14.347
Heavenly Father,
our hearts are so filled with joy today.

10:14.431 --> 10:15.515
-Amen.
-Thank you, Lord.

10:15.598 --> 10:16.558
Praise Jesus.

10:16.641 --> 10:18.059
-[silent mouthing]
-Hear us, Lord,

10:18.143 --> 10:21.938
as we give you thanks for bringing
Grace and Frankie into our lives.

10:22.439 --> 10:25.108
We ask that you give us strength, O Lord,

10:25.191 --> 10:29.612
to help our new friends
in any way we can with their new endeavor.

10:29.696 --> 10:32.073
We ask this in your name. Amen.

10:32.157 --> 10:34.617
-[all] Amen.
-[Grace] Uh...

10:35.201 --> 10:37.704
Arlene, how do you know these women?

10:37.787 --> 10:41.124
Oh, well, I recently joined
St. Erik Lutheran.

10:41.207 --> 10:42.876
This is my prayer group.

10:43.793 --> 10:45.628
[softly] Jesus Christ.

10:45.712 --> 10:49.132
I can't wait to hear
all about this product of yours.

10:49.215 --> 10:51.384
Okay. [stammers]

10:51.468 --> 10:52.719
Oh!

10:53.303 --> 10:55.930
Cookies! We forgot to put out the--

10:56.014 --> 10:58.058
Frankie, mind helping me with the cookies?

10:58.141 --> 11:00.268
Why, are they made of bricks?

11:01.352 --> 11:03.563
So funny. We'll be right back.

11:03.646 --> 11:04.814
Okay.

11:08.276 --> 11:09.444
[whispers] Oh, my God.

11:09.527 --> 11:12.864
Grace? Grace, did you catch
that religion thing?

11:12.947 --> 11:15.950
Since I'm not deaf like you are,
yes, I did!

11:16.034 --> 11:17.702
What are we gonna do?

11:18.203 --> 11:20.538
There's a strong rip current today.

11:20.622 --> 11:24.542
I'm going to walk right into the ocean
and be on my way to Hawaii.

11:24.626 --> 11:25.919
Let me handle it.

11:26.419 --> 11:29.923
I've been waiting my whole life
to talk to a bunch of Bible-thumpers

11:30.006 --> 11:31.966
about my naughty bits.

11:32.050 --> 11:34.719
No and no. I'm gonna do it.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.513
I have to do it.

11:37.263 --> 11:40.141
I've got to do it.
I hope you're getting a kick out of this.

11:40.225 --> 11:42.185
Who are you talking to?

11:52.070 --> 11:54.697
I don't think it's gonna fit.
Careful, 'cause that's glass.

11:54.781 --> 11:55.990
Thank you.

11:56.074 --> 11:59.702
-So, you brought the little guys.
-[sighs]

11:59.786 --> 12:03.206
Yeah, the sitter got her days mixed up,
so I hope that's okay.

12:03.289 --> 12:05.959
Well, I made reservations
at Juniper & Ivy,

12:06.042 --> 12:08.127
but I guess maybe Chuck E. Cheese instead?

12:08.711 --> 12:10.338
Funny. They'll be fine.

12:11.172 --> 12:14.175
Hey... you two.

12:14.259 --> 12:16.094
They have names.

12:16.177 --> 12:17.303
I know.

12:17.387 --> 12:18.555
What are they?

12:20.765 --> 12:23.685
Well, that's Little Round Head
and Big Round Head.

12:23.768 --> 12:25.270
-Jesus, Bree.
-What, I'm their aunt.

12:25.353 --> 12:26.980
I can't have sweet nicknames for them?

12:28.648 --> 12:29.482
Whoa.

12:30.483 --> 12:31.776
[babies chuckles]

12:31.860 --> 12:32.694
What?

12:34.988 --> 12:36.614
Why are they staring at me?

12:37.949 --> 12:40.326
They're babies. Babies stare at things.

12:40.410 --> 12:42.954
Are they gonna burst out crying
for no reason?

12:43.037 --> 12:44.831
There's always a reason.

12:45.415 --> 12:48.042
And can I ask what the fuck
is wrong with you?

12:48.126 --> 12:49.711
What?

12:49.794 --> 12:53.006
Okay, look, I get it.
We all get it. You don't want children.

12:53.089 --> 12:55.216
Doesn't mean you get
to be shitty about mine.

12:55.300 --> 12:58.344
-Mal, I was joking.
-No, it's not funny.

12:58.428 --> 13:01.306
It used to be sort of amusing,
like, "Oh, that's just you,"

13:01.389 --> 13:02.765
but now it's just mean.

13:02.849 --> 13:07.186
And I'm starting to think there's
something really, truly wrong with you.

13:07.270 --> 13:08.438
Ouch.

13:08.521 --> 13:11.649
Yeah, that's how you
make me feel all the time.

13:12.609 --> 13:15.320
-Okay, I'm sorry.
-I don't want your apology.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.989
I just want you to stop being a dick
about my kids.

13:18.072 --> 13:22.785
And if you can't,
I don't want you around them. Okay?

13:24.704 --> 13:26.039
Okay.

13:26.122 --> 13:27.916
Enjoy your lunch.

13:30.752 --> 13:32.045
Wow.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.672
[Grace] Um...

13:34.756 --> 13:38.217
Well, I'd like to tell you
a little something about myself

13:38.301 --> 13:42.096
and how this whole thing got started.

13:42.180 --> 13:46.517
Ten years ago, I was diagnosed
with osteoarthritis in both wrists.

13:46.601 --> 13:47.477
[women groan]

13:47.560 --> 13:48.811
You know, it's very common.

13:49.312 --> 13:52.732
Happens as we age, wear and tear.

13:53.149 --> 13:54.734
Only God is perfect, right?

13:54.817 --> 13:56.235
-Amen.
-That's right.

13:56.986 --> 14:00.198
I'm curious, do any of you
have hand or wrist issues?

14:00.281 --> 14:01.574
Oh, yeah.

14:01.658 --> 14:05.286
My hands are so stiff in the morning,
I can't even open them.

14:05.370 --> 14:09.040
I have to run hot water over them
just to get them going.

14:09.123 --> 14:10.833
Oh, bless your heart.

14:11.960 --> 14:13.962
And how do they feel after you masturbate?

14:17.674 --> 14:21.427
Oh! Oh, no, no, no. It's okay.
You're in a safe place.

14:22.345 --> 14:24.180
No, this is like a--

14:24.681 --> 14:27.016
It's like a sanctuary, so to speak.

14:27.725 --> 14:28.685
Um...

14:29.269 --> 14:31.938
So, does it aggravate the condition?

14:32.021 --> 14:36.484
You know, swelling or pain after you...

14:36.567 --> 14:40.071
After you masturbate, she's saying.

14:41.072 --> 14:42.323
Praise His name.

14:44.200 --> 14:49.580
Probably not your typical
topic of discussion, I imagine,

14:50.164 --> 14:51.332
at your prayer group.

14:52.750 --> 14:54.168
Which is understandable.

14:54.252 --> 14:55.753
I mean, um...

14:55.837 --> 14:58.214
[Frankie] Jesus tap dancing Christ!

14:58.298 --> 15:00.883
Grace, could we just
pass these out right now?

15:00.967 --> 15:02.969
Get this show on the road!

15:03.052 --> 15:04.178
All right.

15:04.262 --> 15:07.432
All of you just, um...
reach down into the bag,

15:07.515 --> 15:09.976
and you'll find a little goodie in there

15:10.059 --> 15:13.563
that might make you feel... born again.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.319
What is it?

15:19.402 --> 15:21.612
Oh, we call it a Ménage à Moi.

15:21.696 --> 15:22.905
It's a vibrator.

15:22.989 --> 15:24.949
-But not just any vibrator.
-Yeah.

15:25.033 --> 15:28.745
No, it's designed specifically
for the older adult woman

15:28.828 --> 15:31.122
with hand or wrist issues.

15:31.205 --> 15:34.500
So, what would you like us to do with it?

15:35.668 --> 15:37.712
What do you think
they want us to do with it?

15:37.795 --> 15:38.629
[scoffs]

15:38.713 --> 15:43.343
I had a feeling this morning.
I had a feeling. Don't go to the beach.

15:43.426 --> 15:44.594
Come on, Carol.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.388
Let's get out of here
before they tie us to our chairs

15:47.472 --> 15:49.265
and force us to watch blue movies.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.559
No. Oh, please, no, don't go.

15:51.642 --> 15:53.019
Lord.

15:54.103 --> 15:58.107
Oh, Arlene, I'm so sorry.
I honestly didn't mean to offend anybody.

15:58.608 --> 16:00.026
It's okay.

16:00.109 --> 16:03.154
We'll stop off at Chili's on our way home.

16:03.237 --> 16:06.282
A molten lava cake will calm them down.

16:10.703 --> 16:11.954
[sighs]

16:12.330 --> 16:13.331
[door closes]

16:13.915 --> 16:15.750
You know, separate from this,

16:15.833 --> 16:18.127
I think I could hang out with Carol.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.546
[doorbell rings]

16:22.256 --> 16:23.591
Peter! Come in. Come in.

16:23.674 --> 16:25.593
Hope I'm not disturbing you guys.

16:25.676 --> 16:27.845
Is Sol here? I don't see his car.

16:27.929 --> 16:29.847
No, he's out foraging for hickory wood.

16:30.932 --> 16:32.308
Long story. Come in, please.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.519
Oh, thanks,
but I'm only here for a minute.

16:34.602 --> 16:36.646
I come bearing news.

16:37.397 --> 16:40.400
I have the distinct pleasure
of informing you

16:40.483 --> 16:42.276
that you have been cast as John Adams

16:42.360 --> 16:45.321
in the New Lear Theatre's
production of<i> 1776!</i>

16:45.405 --> 16:47.740
Ah! Oh, my God!

16:47.824 --> 16:49.158
-Oh!
-[Peter chuckles]

16:49.242 --> 16:50.451
I don't believe it!

16:50.535 --> 16:52.412
Oh, don't be modest.

16:52.495 --> 16:54.455
You blew everyone away.

16:54.956 --> 16:57.667
We are all so excited
about having you with us.

16:57.750 --> 17:01.462
Except Evan Price. He thought
he was just gonna be handed the role.

17:01.546 --> 17:02.839
-Fuck him.
-Okay.

17:02.922 --> 17:04.841
So, uh, what now?

17:04.924 --> 17:08.219
I mean... I'm sorry,
I'm just trying to process all this.

17:08.302 --> 17:10.388
-Sol! Who's Sol playing?
-Hmm.

17:10.471 --> 17:12.807
Yeah. He wasn't cast.

17:12.890 --> 17:14.517
-No?
-Mm-mm.

17:14.600 --> 17:15.852
Nothing?

17:15.935 --> 17:18.646
Oh, come on.
Not understudy to Ben Franklin?

17:18.729 --> 17:20.815
-Nope.
-Background Congressman?

17:20.898 --> 17:23.985
-Sorry.
-Silent Man with spittoon?

17:24.068 --> 17:26.529
Look, I love Sol to death.

17:27.029 --> 17:28.698
You know I do.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.325
But, Robert, his singing voice?

17:31.409 --> 17:32.869
Flatter than West Texas.

17:32.952 --> 17:35.621
And even the most basic dance moves.

17:35.705 --> 17:37.331
Watching him was like...

17:37.415 --> 17:40.501
You know how when a baby horse
is first born

17:40.585 --> 17:43.463
and it tries to get up and walk around
for the first time?

17:43.546 --> 17:46.591
-All spindly and--
-Yeah, I get the picture. Yeah. Oh.

17:47.216 --> 17:51.554
Look, I'm sorry, Robert.
I know it's just community theater,

17:51.637 --> 17:54.807
and gay community theater at that,
but even we have standards.

17:54.891 --> 17:58.227
I understand, but listen,
he could be back any moment,

17:58.311 --> 18:00.480
we've gotta figure out
the best way to tell him.

18:00.563 --> 18:04.525
I was thinking that the best way
to tell him would be for you to do it.

18:04.609 --> 18:07.320
But you're the director.
Isn't that the director's job?

18:07.403 --> 18:10.656
Quite honestly?
This is my first directing gig.

18:10.740 --> 18:13.826
I'm not familiar
with the subtleties of the job yet.

18:20.875 --> 18:23.044
Congratulations, Mr. Adams!

18:23.127 --> 18:24.754
Thank you.

18:27.256 --> 18:28.883
And good luck.

18:31.594 --> 18:32.970
[exhales]

18:33.763 --> 18:35.264
You did good today.

18:35.806 --> 18:37.183
No, I didn't.

18:37.266 --> 18:38.267
Nah, you didn't.

18:38.351 --> 18:39.936
But don't beat yourself up.

18:40.019 --> 18:44.106
I bet the first focus group
for anal beads was a disaster, too.

18:44.190 --> 18:47.443
You don't understand.
We have a huge problem.

18:47.527 --> 18:48.653
You saw what happened.

18:48.736 --> 18:52.490
One word: "masturbation,"
and they are outta here.

18:52.573 --> 18:55.076
It's not like I gave a demonstration.

18:55.159 --> 18:58.412
Hey, that's their problem, not ours.
We have a great thing here.

18:58.496 --> 18:59.997
I know that. You know that.

19:00.915 --> 19:03.334
I want the entire Midwest to know it.

19:03.417 --> 19:05.127
I want the South to know it.

19:05.211 --> 19:07.421
But how do we get them to listen?

19:07.505 --> 19:09.507
They clearly don't want to talk about it.

19:10.758 --> 19:12.885
I didn't want to talk about it.

19:12.969 --> 19:14.303
I know those women.

19:15.388 --> 19:16.472
I was one of them.

19:16.556 --> 19:17.974
I know why they're upset.

19:18.057 --> 19:20.393
Wait. Are you ashamed
of what we're doing here?

19:20.476 --> 19:24.188
Because if you are, tell me and we will
shit-can this whole thing right now.

19:24.272 --> 19:25.565
No, it's just...

19:25.815 --> 19:31.362
how do we get people to try a product
that no one will admit they want or need?

19:31.862 --> 19:34.240
-I wouldn't say "no one."
-What?

19:34.323 --> 19:36.909
One of the vibrators is missing.

19:38.536 --> 19:40.162
Hello. I brought takeout.

19:40.246 --> 19:43.165
Frankie, your car
is in the middle of the street.

19:43.249 --> 19:47.211
Oh, fuck, I left my car
in the middle of the street!

19:47.295 --> 19:49.589
Ooh! Nice.

19:49.672 --> 19:52.174
Oh, wow, it's a lot lighter than--

19:53.384 --> 19:55.219
Who cares? Mine.
It's a lot lighter than mine.

19:56.762 --> 19:58.598
Is that Chinese food?

19:59.307 --> 20:00.141
It is.

20:00.224 --> 20:01.058
[groans]

20:01.142 --> 20:04.770
No. No. No! Mom.

20:04.854 --> 20:08.149
You: "Hey, can you come by
for dinner tonight? Smiley face."

20:08.232 --> 20:10.484
Me: "Sure, I'll bring...
What would you like?"

20:10.568 --> 20:13.487
You: "Anything. Don't care. Wink face."

20:13.571 --> 20:15.114
That's the trouble with texting.

20:15.197 --> 20:18.659
If we had had an actual conversation,
you would know that "anything"

20:18.743 --> 20:20.911
means "anything but Chinese."

20:20.995 --> 20:25.708
Too tired to be mean, so I'm gonna
go with: "Sure. That makes sense."

20:26.292 --> 20:27.335
Bad day?

20:27.918 --> 20:28.961
The usual.

20:29.545 --> 20:30.546
Really?

20:31.255 --> 20:33.883
Mallory called. She told me
what happened in your office.

20:33.966 --> 20:36.218
She said you acted like a real bitch.

20:36.302 --> 20:38.262
God, she's such a tattletale.

20:40.681 --> 20:42.558
How far on her side are you
as of right now?

20:43.559 --> 20:44.393
Pretty far.

20:45.519 --> 20:46.937
I can turn you.

20:50.691 --> 20:53.069
Found it! Hickory.

20:53.152 --> 20:55.863
I had to go all the way to Escondido.

20:56.906 --> 20:59.533
-Here. Smell.
-[sniffs] Very nice.

21:00.576 --> 21:01.827
What's the matter?

21:01.911 --> 21:03.537
Sol... sit down.

21:05.289 --> 21:06.290
Okay.

21:06.374 --> 21:09.418
Actually, before you sit,
could you put the log down?

21:15.132 --> 21:16.258
Robert, what is it?

21:16.342 --> 21:20.137
I have something to tell you,
but I'm not sure how.

21:20.221 --> 21:21.764
Then just tell me.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.058
Yes, um...

21:24.141 --> 21:25.935
I... [sighs]

21:26.018 --> 21:26.852
It's...

21:27.770 --> 21:29.605
-Well--
-Oh, God.

21:30.147 --> 21:31.232
You slept with Grace!

21:31.315 --> 21:33.484
No! I did not sleep with Grace!

21:33.567 --> 21:34.860
Oh! Thank God.

21:34.944 --> 21:37.905
Okay. While you were out,
Peter stopped by--

21:37.988 --> 21:39.031
You slept with Peter?!

21:39.115 --> 21:41.033
I did not sleep with Peter.

21:41.117 --> 21:42.702
I didn't sleep with anyone.

21:43.160 --> 21:45.162
Peter left some disappointing news.

21:45.246 --> 21:49.333
Oh... We didn't get cast, did we?

21:49.417 --> 21:52.420
Well, actually, I got cast...

21:53.045 --> 21:56.340
in a lead role of John Adams.

21:57.007 --> 21:58.801
That's amazing!

21:59.468 --> 22:01.303
I am so proud of you!

22:01.387 --> 22:05.224
-You're going to be a perfect John Adams!
-Well...

22:06.392 --> 22:09.145
-Did I get anything?
-No.

22:09.228 --> 22:10.938
I'm sorry, honey, you weren't cast.

22:11.021 --> 22:12.064
Oh.

22:12.815 --> 22:13.816
Okay.

22:16.026 --> 22:16.986
Nothing?

22:17.737 --> 22:20.322
Not Congressional Custodian, hmm?

22:21.699 --> 22:23.117
Leather-Apron Guy?

22:23.200 --> 22:25.870
Sol, there were only 26 male roles.

22:25.953 --> 22:28.289
-Well, I--
-You're disappointed, of course.

22:28.372 --> 22:31.083
No, no, I'm fine. It was just a lark.

22:31.792 --> 22:34.420
Twenty-six male roles?

22:34.503 --> 22:38.174
Hon, look, I know this was something
we were planning to do together.

22:38.257 --> 22:40.050
So if you don't want me to do it, I won't.

22:40.134 --> 22:43.095
Don't be ridiculous. You have to do it.

22:43.179 --> 22:44.305
You're John Adams!

22:44.388 --> 22:47.349
-Are you sure? Because if you say no--
-Stop.

22:48.184 --> 22:51.187
I'm happy to play another role.

22:52.062 --> 22:54.857
The role of supportive spouse.

22:56.525 --> 22:57.860
Thank you, my love.

23:00.112 --> 23:01.864
[chuckles]

23:01.947 --> 23:02.948
What?

23:03.699 --> 23:06.076
Nothing, I-- I just...

23:07.286 --> 23:09.872
I really thought my dancing
would carry me.

23:11.248 --> 23:13.167
We were supposed to have
an adult lunch.

23:13.250 --> 23:15.252
Why would you bring
Thing One and Thing Two?

23:15.336 --> 23:17.713
Why do people think they can bring
their children everywhere?

23:17.796 --> 23:20.257
You hated it when people
brought children to parties.

23:20.966 --> 23:23.469
That's true. This is different.
It's your family.

23:23.552 --> 23:25.137
Oh, please. Mom, you're just like me.

23:25.221 --> 23:27.932
When that phone rings and you see
it's Mallory, what is your first thought?

23:28.015 --> 23:29.725
It's Mallory, I should pick up.

23:29.808 --> 23:31.560
But then you say a little prayer.

23:31.644 --> 23:35.689
"Please God, don't let her ask me
to watch her innumerable children."

23:35.773 --> 23:38.984
Yeah, maybe.
It's just she has so many of them.

23:39.068 --> 23:41.403
Ha! You are on my side!

23:41.487 --> 23:42.988
I didn't say that.

23:43.072 --> 23:47.493
Mom, I just broke up with a guy. Shouldn't
I be able to talk to my sister about it

23:47.576 --> 23:49.787
without watching babies
hanging from her boobs?

23:49.870 --> 23:52.748
Look, I think everybody can agree
babies are terrible.

23:52.831 --> 23:54.959
-[chuckles]
-Don't share that with your sister.

23:56.460 --> 23:58.003
You know what else she said to me?

23:58.087 --> 24:01.257
She actually said that
she didn't want me around them.

24:01.340 --> 24:06.387
That there's something wrong with me.
Like I'm broken or something.

24:14.645 --> 24:16.522
-Mommy?
-Huh?

24:17.106 --> 24:18.315
Why so quiet?

24:19.567 --> 24:21.443
-I'm avoiding land mines.
-Wait.

24:21.527 --> 24:23.529
You think there's something wrong with me?

24:25.698 --> 24:29.743
Look, why don't you try pretending
that you adore those kids?

24:29.827 --> 24:32.621
That you think they're
the cutest things in the world.

24:32.705 --> 24:33.831
Why should I?

24:33.914 --> 24:36.709
Because Mallory is a mother
with a tribe of children.

24:36.792 --> 24:40.462
She's not the younger sister who used to
stay up with you and braid your hair

24:40.546 --> 24:42.089
and talk about boys.

24:42.172 --> 24:43.132
Mom, we never did that.

24:44.174 --> 24:46.927
-Well, what were you doing up there?
-Smoking.

24:47.636 --> 24:51.265
God, I miss smoking.
And I miss that Mallory.

24:51.348 --> 24:54.727
Well, that Mallory's up to her neck
with dirty diapers and spit-up.

24:54.810 --> 24:58.606
You just have to accept that. Otherwise
you're not gonna have any relationship.

24:58.689 --> 25:00.983
But I want a relationship with her.

25:01.066 --> 25:03.402
Then suck it up
and be nice about the kids.

25:07.072 --> 25:07.948
All of them?

25:08.449 --> 25:09.742
Pick two to start.

25:09.825 --> 25:12.036
Two? That's half.

25:14.413 --> 25:17.583
So remember when we were kids
and we'd get into a huge fight,

25:17.666 --> 25:21.378
and then we'd sit down
and talk it through? Remember?

25:21.462 --> 25:23.505
No. You'd just beat the crap out of me

25:23.589 --> 25:26.342
and eventually we'd forget
what we were fighting about.

25:26.425 --> 25:28.719
Well, do you want
to try to talk it out now?

25:28.802 --> 25:31.472
Well, I don't want
the crap beat out of me, so, sure.

25:31.555 --> 25:33.724
Cool. Okay.

25:33.807 --> 25:36.852
So, um, I just need you to know

25:36.935 --> 25:39.104
that I actually do love your kids.

25:39.188 --> 25:40.564
Because they're your kids.

25:40.648 --> 25:42.691
You've got a very weird way of showing it.

25:42.775 --> 25:44.526
[laughing] I know, right?

25:47.237 --> 25:49.114
Look, I am who I am, Mal.

25:49.198 --> 25:51.283
I mean, I'm never going
to be good with them.

25:51.367 --> 25:54.411
I can't pretend that their dumb stories
make any sense.

25:54.495 --> 25:58.874
And I'll always gag when they get that
gross dirt thing under their runny noses.

25:58.957 --> 26:01.251
But when they're teenagers,

26:01.335 --> 26:05.214
and can clean themselves
and speak correctly,

26:05.297 --> 26:08.717
they are mine. I mean,
they're going to love their Auntie Bree.

26:09.551 --> 26:12.638
-Yeah?
-Yeah. I don't hate your children.

26:13.722 --> 26:15.516
I just miss my sister.

26:16.100 --> 26:17.935
I miss my sister, too.

26:18.018 --> 26:21.897
You just wait. I mean, I'm going to pass
along everything that Frankie taught me.

26:21.980 --> 26:25.943
How to roll a tight joint.
Steer a car only using your feet.

26:26.026 --> 26:27.528
Read aloud from Henry Miller.

26:27.611 --> 26:29.863
-Classy.
-Just the dirty stuff.

26:29.947 --> 26:32.908
[chuckles]
Okay. My children are not to go near you.

26:32.991 --> 26:34.910
Not gonna be able
to keep them away from me.

26:37.246 --> 26:38.580
So, are we okay?

26:39.665 --> 26:41.083
Only time will tell.

26:41.166 --> 26:43.627
Okay, I am gonna beat the crap out of you.

26:52.136 --> 26:53.345
What are you doing?

26:53.429 --> 26:56.098
I'm picking the peas out of my fried rice.

26:56.181 --> 26:58.684
[sighs]
Please don't put them in your nose.

26:58.767 --> 27:00.060
[knocking]

27:00.936 --> 27:02.312
It's Arlene.

27:03.355 --> 27:05.399

27:08.902 --> 27:10.070

-Hi.
-Arlene, come in, please.

27:19.121 --> 27:21.457
I'm sorry about yesterday.

27:21.540 --> 27:23.917
-I should have warned you.
-Don't be sorry.

27:24.001 --> 27:26.170
There's no reason to be sorry.

27:26.253 --> 27:29.882
Listen, I took one of
the vibrators home and--

27:29.965 --> 27:33.260
Ah-ha! I think I know
who took one of the vibrators.

27:34.011 --> 27:37.014
-And love it.
-[Frankie squeals]

27:38.140 --> 27:40.184
There's no other way to say it.

27:40.267 --> 27:44.480
It awakened something in me
that I thought was long dead.

27:44.563 --> 27:47.274
Oh, Arlene,
that's exactly how I felt, too.

27:47.357 --> 27:50.986
I never even realized
how much I missed, you know, it.

27:51.069 --> 27:52.613
[gasps]

27:52.696 --> 27:54.281
How I've missed it.

27:54.364 --> 27:56.950
How did you like
those three glow-in-the-dark buttons?

27:57.034 --> 27:58.035
That was my idea.

27:58.118 --> 28:00.996
Love, love, and love.

28:01.705 --> 28:05.000
How about the gel sleeve, Arlene, huh?
Any wrist pain?

28:05.084 --> 28:08.420
No. In fact, I think
my hearing's improved.

28:08.504 --> 28:10.255
I think mine has, too!

28:10.339 --> 28:11.465
Yours hasn't.

28:11.548 --> 28:15.928
So, I am gonna need
a few of these for my prayer group.

28:16.011 --> 28:17.679
Well, that's why I came by.

28:17.763 --> 28:21.767
You're kidding? Those women? I thought
we were gonna get stoned by vibrator!

28:21.850 --> 28:25.020
Well, it was a pretty quiet drive home.

28:25.103 --> 28:27.272
But then I got phone calls
later that night.

28:27.356 --> 28:30.818
So, I'm gonna need three of these.
Actually, four.

28:30.901 --> 28:35.072
Doreen is on the fence, but I think
I can get her to see the light.

28:35.155 --> 28:38.700
Oh, you two are doing God's work.

28:38.784 --> 28:39.993
What did she say?

28:40.077 --> 28:42.412
[louder] We're doing God's work!
