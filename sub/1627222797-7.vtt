34:58.464 --> 35:00.213

35:00.332 --> 35:00.997
[coughs]

35:06.672 --> 35:07.754
oh, baby.

35:16.932 --> 35:19.983
Baby, when's the last time
I ate your ass?

35:20.068 --> 35:23.103
- I don't know,
like, a week ago?

35:23.188 --> 35:25.188
- I think I have<i> giardia</i> again.

35:25.274 --> 35:27.440
- What the fuck is<i> giardia?</i>

35:27.526 --> 35:28.992
- It's when you eat ass...

35:29.077 --> 35:30.443
- My ass is always spotless.

35:30.529 --> 35:33.246
- And you get infected
with invisible microbes

35:33.365 --> 35:35.332
or some shit.

35:35.417 --> 35:38.535
It's very common; I got it once
senior year of high school.

35:38.620 --> 35:39.669
- When you were on the down-low
with the quarterback,

35:39.755 --> 35:41.872
you ate the quarterback's ass?

35:41.957 --> 35:43.924
- [chuckles]
often, yes.

35:44.042 --> 35:46.009
And vice versa.

35:47.429 --> 35:48.678
[groans]
but yes.

35:48.764 --> 35:51.014
I got<i> giardia</i> from kyle,

35:51.099 --> 35:55.886
and I felt so sick
and so nauseous for weeks.

35:55.971 --> 35:58.805
And I had to take a test
from our family's doctor,

35:58.891 --> 36:00.941
and it came back positive
for<i> giardia.</i>

36:01.059 --> 36:02.692
- What did you do?

36:02.778 --> 36:04.427
- Well, I was mortified.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.696
I lied and I said that

36:06.782 --> 36:09.566
I ate some unwashed fecal fruit
or some shit.

36:09.651 --> 36:11.618
[laughs]
- what'd you have to take?

36:11.737 --> 36:14.287
- Flagyl.

36:14.406 --> 36:16.907
Awful, but it went away
after a week.

36:16.992 --> 36:18.041
- Okay.

36:19.878 --> 36:20.961
Mm.
- I love you.

36:21.079 --> 36:22.712
- I love you.

36:25.551 --> 36:27.918
Uh.
- What?

36:28.003 --> 36:30.453
- Oh, my god.
- What?

36:30.556 --> 36:32.639
Troy?
- Oh, my god.

36:32.758 --> 36:34.925
- What's wrong?
- I don't feel so good.

36:35.010 --> 36:38.311
<i> [eerie music]</i>

36:38.430 --> 36:39.396
- it's not possible.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.266
- Give me your phone.

36:43.352 --> 36:46.135
Just give it to me.

36:46.238 --> 36:47.654
- Jesus, what are you
looking up?

36:47.773 --> 36:49.406
- Alien abductions.
- Pfft.

36:49.491 --> 36:50.690
- Don't give me that look.

36:50.776 --> 36:53.326
When all reasonable explanations
have been eliminated--

36:53.445 --> 36:55.662
- you decide it's aliens? Hmm?

36:55.781 --> 36:58.949
There has to be a rational

36:59.034 --> 37:00.417
explanation for this.
- Like what?

37:00.502 --> 37:02.419
I secretly have two uteruses

37:02.504 --> 37:04.621
my ob-gyn hasn't noticed
until now?

37:04.706 --> 37:07.340
I've developed the ability
to asexually reproduce?

37:07.459 --> 37:10.760
There have been stories about
this kind of thing for decades.

37:10.846 --> 37:14.163
Some of them
seem pretty credible.

37:14.266 --> 37:16.883
There's so much information
out there.

37:16.969 --> 37:17.884
Stories about lost time

37:17.970 --> 37:20.220
and alien experimentation
on humans.

37:20.305 --> 37:22.689
Betty and barney hill in 1961.

37:22.808 --> 37:24.891
You know, some people think
amelia earhart was abducted.

37:24.977 --> 37:27.227
- "close encounters" was not
a documentary, kendall.

37:27.312 --> 37:28.561
[door clicks open]

37:28.647 --> 37:28.895
- hey, guys.

37:31.533 --> 37:33.566
Guys, we've been puking
all day.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.902
- I keep craving weird shit

37:35.988 --> 37:38.121
like vanilla yogurt
with barbecue chips,

37:38.206 --> 37:39.856
but when I eat it,
I can't keep it down.

37:39.958 --> 37:41.574
- How's your chest?

37:41.660 --> 37:44.794
- Like I've been punched
in the tits by tyson.

37:44.880 --> 37:46.463
- What? No! It's not possible.

37:46.548 --> 37:48.164
- What?

37:57.309 --> 37:58.842
- I need you guys
to do something for me.

37:59.978 --> 38:02.262
- This is so dumb.

38:02.347 --> 38:04.547
Men can't get pregnant!

38:04.650 --> 38:05.348
- Just shut up.

38:08.353 --> 38:09.486
- Something's happening
on mine.

38:13.325 --> 38:16.693
- Holy shit.
What does that mean?

38:16.778 --> 38:19.612
- It means all four of us
are pregnant.
