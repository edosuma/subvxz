WEBVTT

00:10.778 --> 00:13.414
( theme music playing )

00:38.339 --> 00:40.741
( announcer
speaking on TV )

00:40.841 --> 00:43.010
( door opens )

00:43.111 --> 00:45.479
BRET, YOU'VE BEEN
GONE FOR HOURS.

00:45.579 --> 00:48.449
I'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR THE BREAD.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

00:48.549 --> 00:53.187
* I WAS WANDERING THROUGH
THE STREETS OF THE CITY *

00:53.287 --> 00:56.124
* RAMBLING THROUGH
THE AVENUES OF TIME *

00:56.224 --> 00:59.527
* WHEN FROM NOWHERE
MY EYES FELL ONTO A GIRL *

00:59.627 --> 01:02.463
* AND BY CHANCE HER EYES
FELL ONTO MINE... *

01:02.563 --> 01:06.434
- OH.
- * SO I SAT AND I ACTED
ALL NONCHALANT *

01:06.534 --> 01:09.503
* SHE SMOKED
HER LAVENDER CIGARETTE *

01:09.603 --> 01:13.541
* READING THE FUTURE
THAT LAY IN MY HANDS *

01:13.641 --> 01:16.610
* MY SHADOW PLAYED
A BASS CLARINET... *

01:18.446 --> 01:20.248
WHERE ARE YOU GOING
WITH THIS, BRET?

01:20.348 --> 01:23.451
* WE WALTZED DOWN
A MOONLIT BOULEVARD *

01:23.551 --> 01:26.554
* JUST TWO SILHOUETTES
IN THE MIST... *

01:26.654 --> 01:30.558
- OH, YES.
- * DAYS WENT BY
AND YEARS WENT BY *

01:30.658 --> 01:33.661
- * MOMENTS WENT BY
WHEN WE KISSED... *
- WHEN WAS THIS?

01:33.761 --> 01:37.198
* SHE SAID, "YOUR BEARD IS
WOVEN OF HEARTACHE *

01:37.298 --> 01:40.301
* AND WE'LL DRINK
FOR THE LONELY TONIGHT *

01:40.401 --> 01:43.671
* AND THE MOON IS
A HORNY OLD DRUNKARD..." *

01:43.771 --> 01:47.308
UH, BRET, COULD YOU PLEASE
MOVE OVER TO YOUR RIGHT?

01:47.408 --> 01:50.811
* WE DRANK DANDELION WINE
AND WE REMINISCED *

01:50.911 --> 01:54.548
- * ABOUT THE MOMENT WHEN
WE FIRST MET THAT DAY... *
- I'M TRYING TO WATCH TV.

01:54.648 --> 01:57.918
* THEN WE REMINISCED ABOUT
HOW WE FIRST REMINISCED... *

01:58.018 --> 02:01.121
OH, YEAH?
SOUNDS A BIT GAY.

02:01.222 --> 02:04.458
* SHE HANDED ME
A BROKEN MEMORY *

02:04.558 --> 02:07.895
* A KEEPSAKE
TO FOREVERMORE SAVE *

02:07.995 --> 02:11.499
* FOR A BRIEF TASTE OF LOVE
IS AS SWEET AS ANY *

02:11.599 --> 02:14.802
* AND WITH THAT
SHE MADE HER WAY. *

02:14.902 --> 02:18.606
SO DID YOU--
DID YOU GET
THE BREAD, OR--

02:18.706 --> 02:21.742
- OH. NO, I FORGOT.
- 'CAUSE I'VE BEEN
WAITING HERE

02:21.842 --> 02:23.577
WITH ALL MY SANDWICH
FILLINGS ALL READY.

02:23.677 --> 02:26.914
YEAH, I WAS JUST
REALLY BUSY THINKING
ABOUT THIS GIRL.

02:27.014 --> 02:29.283
WHAT WAS HER NAME?

02:29.383 --> 02:32.420
* SHE SAID HER NAME
WAS A SECRET *

02:32.520 --> 02:36.123
* THEN SHE SAID HER
NAME WAS CHERI... *

02:36.224 --> 02:38.292
IS HER MIDDLE NAME CHERI?

02:38.392 --> 02:40.828
SO IT'S
A SECRET CHERI MAYBE?

02:40.928 --> 02:42.763
- * MMM, MAYBE...
- WHAT SHE LOOK LIKE?

02:42.863 --> 02:45.599
* SHE LOOKED LIKE
A PARISIAN RIVER... *

02:45.699 --> 02:48.802
- WHAT, DIRTY?
- * SHE LOOKED LIKE
A CHOCOLATE ECLAIR... *

02:48.902 --> 02:52.440
- THAT'S RARE.
- * HER EYES WERE
REFLECTIONS OF EYES... *

02:52.540 --> 02:55.876
- OH, NICE.
- * AND THE RAINBOWS
DANCED IN HER HAIR... *

02:55.976 --> 02:58.812
- OH YEAH.
- * SHE REMINDED ME
OF A WINTER'S MORNING... *

02:58.912 --> 03:02.516
- OH, FRIGID.
- * HER PERFUME WAS
EAU DE TOILETTE... *

03:02.616 --> 03:05.919
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- * SHE WAS COMPARABLE
TO CLEOPATRA... *

03:06.019 --> 03:09.290
- QUITE OLD.
- * SHE WAS LIKE
SHAKESPEARE'S JULIET... *

03:09.390 --> 03:13.494
- OH, 13?
- * THE BOHEMIANS
OF SOHO DID PIROUETTE *

03:13.594 --> 03:16.897
* AS WE WALTZED THROUGH
THE STREETS OF MANHATTAN *

03:16.997 --> 03:20.934
* ON RIVERS OF RIBBON
AND SAILBOATS OF SONG... *

03:21.034 --> 03:23.971
BRET, DID ANY OF THIS
ACTUALLY HAPPEN?

03:24.071 --> 03:26.206
* THERE'S A GIRL
I DESCRIBED *

03:26.307 --> 03:27.841
* SHE'S AS REAL
AS THE WIND *

03:27.941 --> 03:30.411
* IT'S TRUE
I SAW HER TODAY *

03:30.511 --> 03:34.348
* THE OTHER DETAILS
ARE INVENTIONS *

03:34.448 --> 03:37.885
* BECAUSE I PREFER HER
THAT WAY. *

03:39.387 --> 03:41.221
SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU MADE ALL OF THAT UP?

03:41.322 --> 03:44.091
I MADE 95%
OF THAT UP.

03:44.191 --> 03:45.959
WHICH BIT'S TRUE?

03:46.059 --> 03:48.596
I SAW A GIRL.

03:48.696 --> 03:51.365
OH! SO YOUR EXCUSE
FOR NOT GETTING THE BREAD

03:51.465 --> 03:53.267
IS BECAUSE YOU WERE
ON A FANTASY DATE?

03:53.367 --> 03:55.369
WHY DON'T YOU GO
ON A REAL DATE?

03:55.469 --> 03:57.505
BECAUSE THEY'RE NEVER
AS GOOD AS FANTASY DATES.

03:57.605 --> 03:58.706
OH YEAH. WHERE DOES
SHE WORK, THIS GIRL?

03:58.806 --> 04:01.174
SHE WORKS DOWN
AT THE CHEAP ZOO.

04:01.275 --> 04:03.277
- THE PET STORE?
- MM-HMM. YEAH.

04:03.377 --> 04:07.548
- SHE'S, UM, ONE
OF THE CAT TAMERS.
- OH, YES.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.683
EVERY TIME I GO IN THERE
I FREEZE UP, I PANIC

04:09.783 --> 04:11.952
AND I END UP
BUYING TWO GOLDFISH
I DON'T EVEN WANT.

04:12.052 --> 04:14.655
- WHY DO YOU BUY TWO THEN?
- WELL, IF YOU GET TWO,
YOU GET ONE FREE.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.690
BUT YOU DON'T EVEN WANT
ANY GOLDFISH, BRET.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.827
- WHY WOULD YOU BUY TWO?
- MIGHT AS WELL GET ONE FREE.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.995
HEY, JEMAINE, I WAS
WONDERING IF YOU'D THINK
ABOUT BEING MY WINGMAN...

04:22.095 --> 04:24.298
- OH! NO.
- ...LIKE IN "TOP GUN."

04:24.398 --> 04:26.700
NO, BRET.
DO I HAVE TO?

04:26.800 --> 04:28.536
UMM, UH, YES.

04:28.636 --> 04:31.472
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
- IF YOU WANT TO DO IT,
THERE'S A CONDITION.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.140
- WHAT?
- YOU CAN'T HIT ON HER.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.575
WHAT? WHY--
WHY WOULD I HIT ON HER?

04:34.675 --> 04:37.578
- YOU ALWAYS DO THAT.
- OH! WHEN?

04:37.678 --> 04:40.714
- ALWAYS.
- OH, OKAY. SO YOU DO
SOMETHING EVERY TIME,

04:40.814 --> 04:42.350
AND SUDDENLY
YOU'VE GOT A REPUTATION.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.418
- YOU DO IT.
- I DO NOT.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.286
- YOU DO IT.
- I DO NOT.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.921
YES, YOU DO.

04:48.021 --> 04:50.824
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?
- FIXING THE SHOWER.

04:50.924 --> 04:53.627
- IT WASN'T BROKEN.
- WELL, I'M SORRY--
I BROKE IT.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.429
I'M SORRY,
BUT YOU'RE ALWAYS--

04:55.529 --> 04:57.898
YOU'RE ALWAYS MAKING MOVES
ON HIS GIRLS.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.401
OKAY, I WILL NOT MAKE
A MOVE ON THIS GIRL.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.169
YEAH, YOU SHOULD
REMAIN HIDDEN.

05:02.269 --> 05:04.605
YES, REMAIN HIDDEN.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.310
- ( birds chirping )
- ( register beeping )

05:10.411 --> 05:12.913
TAKE A PHOTO
OF ME IN FRONT
OF THE BUDGET BEARS.

05:13.013 --> 05:16.016
BRET, YOU'RE STALLING.
JUST GO AND ASK HER
OUT FOR A DRINK.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.452
Bret:
YEAH, OKAY.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.157
- HELLO.
- OH, HI.

05:24.257 --> 05:26.527
ARE YOU THIRSTY?

05:26.627 --> 05:27.761
WHAT?

05:27.861 --> 05:30.230
GOLDFISH--
ONE GOLDFISH, PLEASE.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.733
UMM, IF YOU BUY TWO,
YOU CAN GET ONE FREE.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.268
OKAY.

05:35.369 --> 05:37.971
Bret: WHAT TIME
DO YOU FEED THE CATS?

05:46.213 --> 05:49.016
HEY! WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

05:49.116 --> 05:51.785
- Both: HEY, DAVE.
- WHAT'S WITH THE FISH, BRET?

05:51.885 --> 05:55.222
- I'VE GOT
A GIRLFRIEND.
- NO.

05:55.322 --> 05:57.791
UH, NOT-- NOT COMPLETELY
A GIRLFRIEND.

05:57.891 --> 06:00.428
- SHE DOESN'T KNOW I EXIST.
- BUT YOU DO--

06:00.528 --> 06:03.397
- YOU DO EXIST, DON'T YOU?
- YEAH. I EXIST, YEAH.

06:04.965 --> 06:07.535
'CAUSE YOU GUYS SAID
YOU DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE.

06:07.635 --> 06:10.137
- YEAH, WE-- WE EXIST.
- YEAH, I EXIST.

06:10.237 --> 06:12.840
- I FULLY EXIST.
- WHY DID YOU TELL ME YOU
WERE FROM NEVER NEVER LAND?

06:12.940 --> 06:14.442
- NEW ZEALAND.
- NEW ZEALAND, MAN.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.577
BUT YOU SAID
YOU GUYS FLEW HERE.

06:16.677 --> 06:19.046
ON A PLANE.
ON A PLANE, DAVE.

06:19.146 --> 06:22.583
HEY, DAVE, DO YOU HAVE
ANY OF THOSE MINIATURE
HEADPHONE MICROPHONE SETS?

06:22.683 --> 06:25.252
- 'CAUSE I WANT TO PUT
MY WINGMAN HERE IN A VAN.
- YEAH, SURE.

06:25.352 --> 06:28.121
HE'S GONNA GIVE ME
ADVICE WHILE I GO
AND SEE THIS GIRL.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.623
HE GOT AN IDEA
FROM A SITCOM.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.492
JEMAINE'S
YOUR WINGMAN, HUH?

06:31.592 --> 06:33.494
- YES.
- WHAT THE FUCK DOES
HE KNOW ABOUT WOMEN?

06:33.594 --> 06:36.263
I KNOW ABOUT BRASSIERES.
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THOSE?

06:36.363 --> 06:38.365
GUYS, WOMEN LIKE
THREE THINGS:

06:38.466 --> 06:40.367
MEN IN KILTS,
SOUTHERN COMFORT,

06:40.468 --> 06:42.402
AND CHRIS ISAAK'S
"WICKED GAME."

06:42.503 --> 06:44.004
WHOA, HE DOES KNOW
MORE THAN YOU.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.006
YEAH, I THINK YOU'RE
OVERSIMPLIFYING WOMEN.

06:48.876 --> 06:51.579
- OKAY, BAND MEETING.
- UH, MURRAY?

06:51.679 --> 06:53.581
OH, GREG,
I'M JUST IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING, PLEASE.

06:53.681 --> 06:56.450
- I'M SORRY, MURRAY.
- SHUSH NOW, OKAY?

06:56.550 --> 06:58.385
- WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?
- IT'S JUST THAT--

06:58.486 --> 07:00.654
PLEASE! THIS WON'T
TAKE A MINUTE.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.390
NOW, WHERE WAS I,
JEMAINE?

07:03.491 --> 07:05.593
UH-- YEAH, YOU WERE
AT "JEMAINE."

07:05.693 --> 07:08.061
- OKAY. PRESENT.
- Jemaine: YES, PRESENT.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.230
- BRET.
- MM-HMM.

07:10.330 --> 07:12.399
OKAY, AND MURRAY--
PRESENT.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.602
THAT WASN'T
TOO HARD, WAS IT?

07:14.702 --> 07:16.670
- NOW WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
- HELEN'S ON THE LINE.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.840
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY?!
WHAT DOES SHE WANT?

07:19.940 --> 07:22.209
SHE SAYS SHE'S
IN A MEETING WITH
THE CHINESE AMBASSADOR.

07:22.309 --> 07:25.045
THERE'S 16 PEOPLE THERE,
BUT THERE'S ONLY
12 SANDWICHES.

07:25.145 --> 07:29.983
OH NO.
I ONLY ORDERED 12.

07:30.083 --> 07:34.387
- ON LINE ONE.
- SORRY, GUYS,
OFFICIAL BUSINESS.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.624
HEY, HELEN.

07:36.724 --> 07:38.058
YES.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.594
YUP, 16 PEOPLE.
I HEARD.

07:40.694 --> 07:43.897
YEAH, ONLY 12 SANDWICHES.
I KNOW. IT'S TERRIBLE.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.365
YEAH.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.200
WHY?

07:47.300 --> 07:50.704
OH, UM...

07:50.804 --> 07:52.940
UH, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
AT THE END OF THE DAY, UM--

07:53.040 --> 07:57.444
( low voice )
ACTUALLY, I THINK
GREG COULD BE RESPONSIBLE.

07:57.545 --> 08:00.914
I WAS WALKING PAST
HIS DESK

08:01.014 --> 08:03.951
AND I SAW
IN HIS WASTEPAPER BIN

08:04.051 --> 08:07.721
HES.
SOME WRAPPERS WHICH I THINK
WERE FROM SANDWI

08:07.821 --> 08:10.924
AND JUST LOOKING
AT HIS FACE EARLIER,

08:11.024 --> 08:13.827
I DID NOTICE
HE HAD SOME CRUMBS
JUST AROUND HIS MOUTH--

08:13.927 --> 08:15.696
JUST ON EACH SIDE.
I THINK THEY WERE
SANDWICH CRUMBS.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.765
I'M NOT POINTING
ANY FINGERS,

08:17.865 --> 08:19.667
BUT I THINK
IF I WAS YOU,

08:19.767 --> 08:23.403
I WOULD PROBABLY LOOK
AT THE THIRD SUSPECT
BEING GREG.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.273
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.
I'LL TELL HIM.

08:28.108 --> 08:32.212
UM, HELEN'S DISAPPOINTED
THAT YOU ATE FOUR OF THEM,

08:32.312 --> 08:35.315
SO-- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

08:35.415 --> 08:37.985
THAT'S OKAY, MURRAY.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.920
THANK YOU.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.189
I THINK HE HEARD
THE WHOLE THING, DIDN'T HE?

08:42.289 --> 08:44.558
- PROBABLY. HE WAS
JUST STANDING THERE.
- YEAH.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.393
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
THAT ANGRY.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.862
MURRAY, DO WE HAVE
ANY GIGS OR ANYTHING?

08:48.962 --> 08:52.399
- BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO GO.
- GOT SOMETHING ON, HAVE YOU?

08:52.499 --> 08:54.868
- YEAH.
- OH, I'VE GOT NOTHING
ON THE AGENDA TODAY. LOOK.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.904
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- I'VE PUT "NOTHING" HERE.

08:57.004 --> 08:59.439
- "NO NEED TO COME IN."
- WELL, WHY HAVE YOU
CALLED US IN?

08:59.539 --> 09:00.941
- I DON'T KNOW.
- YOU WROTE THAT DOWN?

09:01.041 --> 09:03.376
- YEAH, I WROTE "NOTHING."
- BUT YOU CALLED US UP

09:03.476 --> 09:05.613
AND TOLD US TO COME IN

09:05.713 --> 09:07.480
TO TELL US THERE'S
NO NEED TO COME IN?

09:07.581 --> 09:09.049
- THAT'S WEIRD, ISN'T IT?
- WHY'D YOU CALL US?

09:09.149 --> 09:12.452
WELL, IT'S LIKE--
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A HABIT.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.287
YOU KNOW, WE SORT OF FALL
INTO THESE PATTERNS.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.390
DAY AFTER DAY,
WE END UP DOING
THE SAME SORT OF THING.

09:17.490 --> 09:20.160
IT'S A BIT LIKE
SHELLEY AND I, ACTUALLY,

09:20.260 --> 09:21.862
LOOKING BACK.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.932
I THINK THAT'S WHERE
THE CRACKS STARTED TO SHOW--

09:25.032 --> 09:27.367
JUST GETTING USED
TO EACH OTHER SO MUCH,

09:27.467 --> 09:29.637
TAKING EACH OTHER
FOR GRANTED

09:29.737 --> 09:32.339
LIKE A PAIR
OF OLD SNEAKERS--
THEY'RE ALWAYS THERE.

09:32.439 --> 09:34.775
PUT THEM ON,
SAME THING DAY AFTER DAY.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.684
OH, I'LL GET US
SOME CAKE.

09:43.784 --> 09:46.553
GREG, IS THERE ANY
OF THAT ORANGE CAKE LEFT?

09:46.654 --> 09:49.256
IT'S MURRAY.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.627
OH NO.
HE IS ANGRY.

09:53.727 --> 09:57.698
SORRY, GUYS.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
CALM THE STORM.

10:03.837 --> 10:06.573
Jemaine over walkie-talkie:
Uh, can you hear me, Bret?

10:06.674 --> 10:08.776
Dave over walkie-talkie:
Chicken torso.

10:08.876 --> 10:10.644
Jemaine:
Chicken torso,
can you hear me?

10:10.744 --> 10:13.113
Chicken torso,
raise a hand if
you can hear me.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.448
- Jemaine: Yeah.
- Dave: There you go.

10:15.548 --> 10:17.550
- COOL.
- NOW BE BRAVE, BRET.

10:17.651 --> 10:19.653
Dave:
Stop shaking, Bret.
Stop shaking.

10:19.753 --> 10:22.255
STAND WITH YOUR FEET APART
LIKE YOUR BALLS ARE ON FIRE.

10:22.355 --> 10:26.426
Jemaine: Don't do
the accompanying face,
though-- just the stance.

10:26.526 --> 10:29.062
GO UP TO HER.
JUST APPROACH HER.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.031
- Dave: Back up, back up.
- Jemaine: Good work, Bret.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.266
NOW SAY HELLO.
TURN AROUND THOUGH.

10:33.366 --> 10:36.136
No no, stay facing away
from her. It makes you
seem different.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.505
HALF IGNORE HER AND HALF
PAY ATTENTION TO HER.

10:38.605 --> 10:41.341
- HELLO.
- HI, DO YOU NEED HELP?

10:41.441 --> 10:43.677
- Jemaine: Turn side on.
- Dave: Say something,
you asshole!

10:43.777 --> 10:46.379
- UM...
- Jemaine: Say hello.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.548
- HELLO.
- HI, CAN I HELP YOU?

10:48.648 --> 10:51.551
- COMPLIMENT HER HAIR.
- ASK HER WHAT'S UP
WITH HER FACE.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.854
- WHAT'S UP
WITH YOUR FACE?
- WHAT?

10:53.954 --> 10:56.523
YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE SAID THAT.
IT'S TOO EARLY.

10:56.623 --> 10:59.860
IS THAT A WALKIE-TALKIE
ON YOUR KILT?

10:59.960 --> 11:01.995
Both:
Tell her it's an iPod.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.732
- NO, THIS IS JUST--
- Jemaine: An old iPod.

11:04.832 --> 11:07.167
- It's an old iPod.
- OKAY.

11:07.267 --> 11:10.203
- GOOD WORK.
NOW TELL HER YOU'RE FREAKY.
- DON'T TELL HER THAT.

11:10.303 --> 11:13.506
- TELL HER YOU'RE A FREAK.
- WHY WOULD YOU TELL HER
THAT HE'S FREAKY?

11:13.606 --> 11:17.044
- HOW'S HE GONNA GET INTO
HER PANTS IF HE DOESN'T--
- ( walkie-talkie smashes )

11:17.144 --> 11:20.247
- CAN I HELP YOU
WITH SOMETHING?
- ( walkie-talkie crackles )

11:20.347 --> 11:23.083
I'LL JUST--
I'LL JUST GET
A GOLDFISH, PLEASE.

11:28.521 --> 11:31.859
- HEY, GUYS.
- Both: HEY, MEL.

11:31.959 --> 11:34.294
HEY, WHY HAVE YOU BEEN
STANDING HERE FOR SO LONG?

11:34.394 --> 11:35.695
IT'S BEEN, LIKE, HOURS--

11:35.796 --> 11:38.799
LIKE, THREE...
AND A HALF HOURS.

11:38.899 --> 11:41.068
- JUST HANGING OUT.
- JUST-- JUST--

11:41.168 --> 11:43.303
ARE YOU GONNA STEAL
THIS CAR?

11:43.403 --> 11:45.705
- OH, NO, WE'RE JUST
SPYING ON SOMEONE...
- NO NO.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.374
- WHO?
- ...FOR BRET.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.276
- NO ONE. NO.
- NO ONE.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.544
OH MY GOD, IS IT ME?

11:51.644 --> 11:53.814
- NO. NO.
- IT'S ME, ISN'T IT?

11:53.914 --> 11:55.816
- NO.
- YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING ME.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.618
THAT IS...
SO CREEPY, YOU GUYS.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.754
THAT IS AN INVASION
OF MY PERSONAL SPACE.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.956
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
WHY WOULD YOU WATCH ME?

12:03.056 --> 12:06.193
HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING ME?
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

12:06.293 --> 12:08.628
WHAT HAVE I BEEN DOING?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I DO.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.697
- MEL, IT WASN'T--
WE WEREN'T WATCHING YOU.
- IT WASN'T YOU, MEL.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.732
IT'S THE GIRL
OVER AT THE PET SHOP.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.334
- YOU'RE FOLLOWING HER?
- Bret: NO.

12:14.434 --> 12:15.936
BRET'S IN LOVE WITH HER.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.670
- Bret: NO, I'M NOT.
I'M NOT.
- BRET!

12:17.771 --> 12:19.439
- WHY?
- WELL-- I'M NOT.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.141
BRET, IF YOU
REALLY LOVE SOMEONE,

12:21.241 --> 12:22.876
YOU HAVE TO GET
TO KNOW THEM AS A PERSON.

12:22.976 --> 12:25.012
YOU CAN'T JUST
WATCH THEM FROM AFAR.

12:25.112 --> 12:29.850
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO
LEARN WHAT THEY ARE
LIKE ON THE INSIDE.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.953
GET CLOSER.
FIND THE KEY
TO THEIR HEART.

12:33.053 --> 12:37.224
I LIKE TO FIND
USEFUL INFORMATION
IN BILLS, LETTERS.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.492
SOMETIMES I COLLECT
NAIL CLIPPINGS,

12:39.592 --> 12:41.128
BUT THAT'S JUST ME.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.663
BRET, DOES SHE RUN
AN INDIAN FOOD TAKEAWAY?

12:43.763 --> 12:47.167
- NO.
- HERE, USE THESE.
IT'S EASIER.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.702
OH, THANKS.
WHY DO YOU HAVE THOSE?

12:49.803 --> 12:52.339
- YEAH. NO REASON.
- BRET, SHE LOVES EGGS.

12:52.439 --> 12:56.910
- MAKE HER AN OMELET.
- OH, IS HER NAME SAVANNAH?
DOES SHE WORK AT PETLAND?

12:57.010 --> 12:59.346
- WORKS AT PETLAND, YEAH.
- OH.

12:59.446 --> 13:03.550
- Jemaine: HALF AN AVOCADO.
- SHE HAS $145 ON HER
ELECTRIC BILL.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.953
- Jemaine: TEA BAGS, YOGURT.
- THAT'S GREAT, MEL.

13:06.053 --> 13:08.121
YOU KNOW, BRET,
WHEN YOU LOVE SOMEONE,

13:08.221 --> 13:10.924
YOU NEED ALL
THE AMMUNITION YOU CAN
GET TO TAKE THEM DOWN.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.725
- RIGHT.
- LOOK AT ME AND DOUG.

13:12.826 --> 13:15.695
HE RESISTED AT FIRST.
IN THE END HE CRACKED

13:15.795 --> 13:18.465
AND LOOK AT US TODAY--
WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.

13:18.565 --> 13:22.235
MEL, THIS DUMPSTER
IS DEFINITELY FROM
A DIFFERENT BUILDING.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.437
- ( sighs )
KEEP LOOKING, DOUG.
- BRET...

13:24.537 --> 13:26.439
I THINK
SHE HAS MAN'S FEET.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.308
MAN FEET, BRET.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.743
AH. MOTORCYCLE MAGAZINES.

13:30.844 --> 13:33.380
- SHE MUST LIKE TOUGH GUYS.
- TOUGH GUYS?

13:33.480 --> 13:35.215
YEAH.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.553
JEMAINE,
COME AND LOOK AT THIS.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.056
- THERE'S GREG, SEE?
- YEAH.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.525
- LOOK HOW SAD HE LOOKS.
- HE LOOKS NORMAL.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.060
WHO'S THAT
HE'S TALKING TO?

13:47.160 --> 13:48.929
MIGHT BE A BUSINESSMAN,
DO YOU THINK?

13:49.029 --> 13:50.898
- I DON'T KNOW.
- JEMAINE.

13:50.998 --> 13:53.133
I WANT YOU
TO BE MY WINGMAN.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.435
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- YEAH.

13:55.535 --> 13:58.438
DISTRACT HIS MATE
WHILE I APOLOGIZE TO GREG.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.807
- COME ON.
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO SAY TO A BUSINESSMAN.

14:00.908 --> 14:04.577
- BUSINESS STUFF-- YOU KNOW,
STOCK EXCHANGE, CALCULATORS.
- ( chatting )

14:04.677 --> 14:07.580
( knocks )
HEY. HEY, GUYS.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.049
- HEY, GUYS.
- MIND IF WE JOIN YOU?

14:09.149 --> 14:10.984
ACTUALLY,
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A MEETING, MURRAY.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.286
OH, LIKE THAT,
IS IT, GREG?

14:13.386 --> 14:15.288
NO NO, IT'S FINE.
PLEASE SIT DOWN.

14:15.388 --> 14:18.892
- Jemaine: HI THERE.

14:18.992 --> 14:22.462
- WELL-- HI, GREG.
- I LIKE YOUR TIE.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.998
WELL, GREG,
I JUST WANTED
TO SAY SORRY

14:25.098 --> 14:27.534
YOU KNOW,
FOR TELLING HELEN THAT
YOU ATE THOSE SANDWICHES.

14:27.634 --> 14:30.971
- I KNOW EVERYONE'S
BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT.
- ( Jemaine and man chatting )

14:31.071 --> 14:33.573
I JUST WANTED
YOU TO KNOW THAT
I KNOW YOU'RE INNOCENT.

14:33.673 --> 14:37.244
AND-- OH, I GOT YOU
SOME CHOCOLATES
FROM MY DESK.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.514
THEY'RE A BIT
SQUASHED, BUT--

14:41.614 --> 14:43.616
THANK YOU, MURRAY.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.319
NO BREAKING
THROUGH THAT WALL
OF ICE, IS THERE?

14:46.419 --> 14:49.322
ANOTHER CHOCOLATE.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.892
THANK YOU.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.729
- COME ON, JEMAINE, LET'S GO.

14:56.829 --> 14:59.032
- JEMAINE.
- THIS IS A FUN GAME.
DO YOU EVER PLAY IT ONLINE?

14:59.132 --> 15:02.002
- UH--
- NO, JEMAINE DOESN'T
GO ONLINE.

15:02.102 --> 15:05.038
- COME ON, LET'S--
- OKAY. SORRY, SVEN,
I HAVE TO GO.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.207
- IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU.
- GOOD TO MEET YOU.

15:12.012 --> 15:15.215
BRET, I DON'T WANT
TO BE YOUR WINGMAN ANYMORE.

15:15.315 --> 15:18.585
- WHAT? WHY NOT?
- IT'S TIRING.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.187
- I'M EXHAUSTED.
- ONE LAST THING.

15:20.287 --> 15:21.888
- NO.

INTO SAVANNAH TONIGHT,

15:21.989 --> 15:24.524
YOU MUG US
AND I BEAT YOU UP
A LITTLE BIT.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.493
- OKAY.
- YEAH?

15:26.593 --> 15:29.662
- WHERE'D YOU GET THIS IDEA?
- I SAW IT ON A SITCOM.

15:29.762 --> 15:33.266
- DID IT WORK
ON THE SITCOM?
- NOT COMPLETELY, NO,

15:33.366 --> 15:36.069
BUT THIS IS REAL,
SO I THINK WE'VE GOT
A BETTER CHANCE.

15:47.514 --> 15:50.283
- HEY.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.152

YEAH, I'VE BOUGHT, LIKE,
63 GOLDFISH OFF YOU.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.730

16:03.830 --> 16:07.300
- DO YOU WANT ME
TO WALK YOU HOME?
- OKA-- ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.137
I'M HAPPY TO BE
YOUR BODYGUARD.
THIS IS A DANGEROUS CORNER.

16:11.538 --> 16:14.374
OKAY, WHEN THEY COME PAST,
WE HAVE TO JUMP ON THEM.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.143
- YEAH YEAH, I KNOW.

16:16.243 --> 16:18.278
YEAH, I'VE GOT IT.
I'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.947
AND BRET IS GOING TO
BEAT US UP A LITTLE BIT.

16:21.048 --> 16:23.416
YEAH, IF HE DOES THAT,
I'LL FUCKING KILL HIM.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.985
NO. NO NO NO NO.
DON'T KILL HIM.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.521
IF THAT PIECE OF SHIT
LAYS A FINGER ON ME,

16:28.621 --> 16:31.124
- I WILL FUCK HIM UP.
- NO, WE'VE GOT TO
LET HIM BEAT US,

16:31.224 --> 16:32.992
AND THEN SAVANNAH
WILL BE IMPRESSED THAT--

16:33.093 --> 16:34.894
RIGHT RIGHT.
NO, THAT'S RIGHT,

MACHO GUYS.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.631
RIGHT, AND THEN
HE LOOKS GOOD.
I'VE GOT IT. OKAY.

16:38.731 --> 16:41.000
BUT THE MONEY--
THE MONEY, 50-50,
RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.670
- OKAY? I'M NOT GONNA DO--
- NO, WE HAVE TO LET THEM
KEEP THE PURSE.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.406
- WHAT? WHAT?
- WE HAVE TO LET
THEM KEEP THE PURSE.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.275
I TOLD YOU--
DID I NOT EXPLAIN THAT?

16:48.375 --> 16:49.309
- YOU KNOW, THIS IS BULLSHIT.
- I SHOULD'VE EXPLAINED THAT.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.877
NO, JEMAINE,
THIS IS BULLSHIT.

16:50.977 --> 16:52.545
I DIDN'T COME OUT HERE
TO DO PRO BONO WORK.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.581
I DO THIS FOR A LIVING.
THIS IS MY PROFESSION.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.684
YOU CAN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF OUR FRIENDSHIP LIKE THIS.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.552
WELL, I HOPE IT DOESN'T
COME ACROSS THAT WAY.

16:59.652 --> 17:03.490
- I JUST LOVE FISH.
DO YOU LOVE FISH?
- YEAH. YEAH.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.758

17:16.436 --> 17:18.871
- YEAH. YEAH.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.811
I'M DOING
PRETEND MUGGINGS.

17:24.911 --> 17:27.647
- HOW'S THIS LOOK?

17:27.747 --> 17:29.516

17:29.616 --> 17:31.318
TAKE IT OFF.

HEY, YOU WEREN'T MACED.

OKAY, THERE'S A CARD.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.804
"JEMAINE CLEMAINE,
NEW ZEALAND DIPLOMAT."

19:33.039 --> 19:34.574
THIS LOOKS LIKE
IT WAS MADE

19:34.674 --> 19:36.376
ON ONE OF THOSE MACHINES
YOU FIND AT KINKO'S.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.044
THAT'S RIGHT.
YEAH, WE'VE GOT
AN ACCOUNT THERE.

19:38.144 --> 19:41.314
WE GET THEM ALL DONE THERE.
AND HERE'S MY ONE.

19:41.414 --> 19:44.251
YOU CAN GET
1,000 DONE FOR $10.

19:44.351 --> 19:45.685
WHERE DO YOU GET
YOUR CARDS DONE?

19:45.785 --> 19:47.554
YOU'VE GOT BADGES,

19:47.654 --> 19:49.188
- DO YOU GET
THOSE AT KINKO'S?

19:49.289 --> 19:51.023

19:57.897 --> 20:00.166
( whispering )
HE'S ACTUALLY ANGRY
WITH ME ABOUT SOMETHING,

20:00.267 --> 20:01.968
SO I'VE BROUGHT HIM
IN HERE AS A TREAT.

20:02.068 --> 20:05.605
WE DON'T REALLY NEED HIM,
BUT IT'S GOOD TO GET HIM
OUT OF THE OFFICE.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.575
LOOK, THE DIPLOMAT IN QUESTION
WAS GUILTY OF ASSAULT.

20:08.675 --> 20:11.344
TYPICAL.
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.780
HE'S SORT OF A BIT
OF A RENEGADE, BUT--

20:13.880 --> 20:18.251
- OKAY, YOU CAN JUST
TAKE HIM WITH YOU
- THANK YOU.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.787
CAN WE GET
MY FRIEND JOHN
OUT AS WELL?

20:20.887 --> 20:22.389

20:22.489 --> 20:24.491
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, GREG?
FRIENDS AGAIN?

20:24.591 --> 20:26.759
- UH, SURE, MURRAY.
- COME HERE.

20:26.859 --> 20:29.462
ALL RIGHT. I KNEW
BRINGING YOU HERE
WAS A GOOD THING.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.131
- SORRY ABOUT
THE SANDWICHES, OKAY?
- MM-HMM. SURE.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.701
- IT'S GOOD TO HAVE
THE VIBE BACK TO WHAT WE HAD.
- Officer: YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:34.801 --> 20:36.803
GENTLEMEN, I'M ACTUALLY
QUITE BUSY AT THE MOMENT,

20:36.903 --> 20:39.238
SO IF YOU COULD MAYBE DO THIS
SOME OTHER TIME, MAYBE?

20:39.339 --> 20:42.342
SORRY, OFFICER.

20:42.442 --> 20:44.911
THANK YOU

20:48.648 --> 20:50.883

20:50.983 --> 20:53.686
WOULD YOU LIKE
PEANUT BUTTER

Tell her

Tell her you're freaky.

20:56.623 --> 20:59.626
- UM, I WOULD LOVE NEITHER...

and get him out of jail.

20:59.726 --> 21:02.161

21:02.261 --> 21:05.365

21:08.167 --> 21:11.237
DID I MENTION

SORT OF FREAKY GUYS?

21:11.338 --> 21:13.540
