WEBVTT

00:00.469 --> 00:02.074
- [Gordon] Tonight on Hotel Hell,

00:02.074 --> 00:03.597
I head to a Pennsylvania inn.

00:03.597 --> 00:04.733
Where's the reception?

00:04.733 --> 00:06.204
Whose delusional owner..

00:06.204 --> 00:08.477
- I want what I want, I know what I want.

00:08.477 --> 00:10.896
- [Gordon] Has completely neglected it.

00:10.896 --> 00:13.722
Look at all those bugs,
cockroach to welcome me

00:13.722 --> 00:14.816
on the toilet,
- [Woman] Now way.

00:14.816 --> 00:15.901
- [Gordon] Having a number two.

00:15.901 --> 00:17.100
- I'm just like, I can't believe it.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.998
- [Gordon] And what I discover,

00:18.998 --> 00:21.217
will make you sick to your stomach.

00:21.217 --> 00:23.148
Unfucking believable.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.597
Has this thing ever been washed?

00:24.597 --> 00:25.734
- I don't even like to think of what

00:25.734 --> 00:26.602
I'm looking at.

00:26.602 --> 00:27.631
- This is truly disgusting.

00:27.631 --> 00:29.949
- That's not an inn,
it's a fucking disaster.

00:29.949 --> 00:32.817
(dramatic music)

00:33.956 --> 00:37.085
(upbeat rock music)

01:00.675 --> 01:03.636
Two years ago, chef and
restauranter Ken Pisciotta

01:03.636 --> 01:06.274
had a dream, and he
bought the River Rock Inn,

01:06.274 --> 01:09.058
in Milford, Pennsylvania,
a charming town nestled

01:09.058 --> 01:10.820
in the stunning Pocono mountains,

01:10.820 --> 01:12.530
just two hours drive from Manhattan.

01:12.530 --> 01:14.167
- It was a golden opportunity,

01:14.167 --> 01:17.158
the light shone upon me
and said, "Come this way".

01:17.158 --> 01:19.851
(upbeat music)

01:22.165 --> 01:24.042
- [Gordon] But soon after he got the keys,

01:24.042 --> 01:26.242
the dream turned into a nightmare.

01:26.242 --> 01:28.880
- I was expecting to
reach a certain number

01:28.880 --> 01:33.291
on room sales and I
didn't hit 1/10th of that.

01:33.291 --> 01:37.222
- I don't think Kenny has
an idea how to run an inn.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.786
- [Gordon] And the few
guests that do come,

01:38.786 --> 01:40.058
are far from impressed.

01:40.058 --> 01:40.934
- There's nothing in bathroom,

01:40.934 --> 01:43.593
no shampoo, no conditioner, soap, nothing

01:43.593 --> 01:45.230
we have to go out and buy some.

01:45.230 --> 01:48.128
- If I came in, I would probably
check right back up out.

01:48.128 --> 01:51.955
- It is old, it's trying
to be cosy but it's not.

01:51.955 --> 01:53.978
- It's hideous, if I
wanted to stay at my grans,

01:53.978 --> 01:56.116
I could pack a bag and
go stay at my grans,

01:56.116 --> 01:59.077
I'm not going to a BNB for that.

01:59.077 --> 02:01.579
- If you buy an inn, you got
to step up and be an innkeeper,

02:01.579 --> 02:03.769
we need to fill these rooms, we really do.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.324
- [Gordon] Facing financial disaster,

02:06.324 --> 02:09.681
Ken was forced to move out of
his house and into the inn.

02:09.681 --> 02:12.058
- I said, "Ken, you're
making the biggest mistake"

02:12.058 --> 02:14.530
when he turned into a miserable man.

02:14.530 --> 02:16.532
- [Gordon] Ken is now 48, single,

02:16.532 --> 02:18.596
living in his crumbling inn and hundreds

02:18.596 --> 02:20.317
of thousands of dollars in debt.

02:20.317 --> 02:21.388
The more the hotel fails.

02:21.388 --> 02:25.353
- [Ken] $2,868 in taxes, that is so good.

02:25.353 --> 02:27.647
- [Gordon] The more
controlling Ken becomes.

02:30.196 --> 02:31.505
- He just takes everything out on us,

02:31.505 --> 02:35.686
to make our lives feel
miserable just like his.

02:35.686 --> 02:37.073
- You don't feel very good about yourself

02:37.073 --> 02:42.146
as an employee, kind of chips
away at your sense of self.

02:42.146 --> 02:43.347
- [Ken] I don't know what's going on..

02:43.347 --> 02:45.113
- I told you I buy a little time so.

02:45.113 --> 02:47.156
- Kenny's down here, everyone's
walking on eggshells,

02:47.156 --> 02:49.148
everybody's afraid to do their job,

02:49.148 --> 02:50.378
they don't want to be yelled at.

02:50.378 --> 02:52.380
- [Ken] Flip, come here.

02:52.380 --> 02:53.350
- Fuck yourself.

02:53.350 --> 02:55.852
- Everybody threatens to
quit, it's a daily event.

02:55.852 --> 02:57.104
- If things don't get better here,

02:57.104 --> 02:58.292
I'm definitely leaving.

02:58.292 --> 02:59.569
- You know what?

02:59.569 --> 03:00.437
You really need to grow
up and act your age,

03:00.437 --> 03:02.004
you're 48 year old, man,
just getting the fuck

03:02.004 --> 03:02.873
out of my face.

03:02.873 --> 03:04.663
The progression of events
has just turned it all

03:04.663 --> 03:06.853
into a hot mess and it
doesn't matter what we do,

03:06.853 --> 03:08.637
it's just a hot flipping mess.

03:08.637 --> 03:11.505
(dramatic music)

03:12.786 --> 03:16.032
- River Rock Inn, an American bistro, wow.

03:19.001 --> 03:20.148
Where's the reception?

03:24.164 --> 03:26.945
(playful music)

03:28.614 --> 03:31.064
Right, anyone in?

03:31.064 --> 03:33.703
(cat meows)

03:33.703 --> 03:35.830
It's like a hallway, not a check-in desk,

03:35.830 --> 03:37.818
unless she's behind there.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.010
Hello, hello?

03:39.010 --> 03:41.005
Somebody's ashes are down there.

03:41.005 --> 03:42.048
Bloody hell.

03:44.773 --> 03:45.642
Looks like my granddad's house.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.248
Hello?

03:47.248 --> 03:48.614
Hey where's reception?

03:48.614 --> 03:50.574
- This is it basically,
the receptionist should be

03:50.574 --> 03:52.878
out in a minute if you'd
like, I'll chivvy her for you.

03:52.878 --> 03:53.747
- Thank you very much.

03:53.747 --> 03:54.734
- Well, hello.

03:54.734 --> 03:55.959
- [Gordon] Nice to see you.

03:55.959 --> 03:56.828
- It's nice to see you.

03:56.828 --> 03:58.409
I'm Karen Loeschorn, it's
a pleasure to meet you.

03:58.409 --> 03:59.277
- I'm a little bit nervous then.

03:59.277 --> 04:00.313
- You were nervous?

04:00.313 --> 04:02.304
- Yeah honestly, because I
was standing here on my own.

04:02.304 --> 04:04.601
- Oh well, I'm sorry,
I apologise for that.

04:05.526 --> 04:07.507
- It's confusing, where's
the reception desk?

04:07.507 --> 04:09.114
- It's right here.
- [Gordon] Right.

04:09.114 --> 04:09.983
- [Karen] This is the the reception desk.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.146
- Can I just quickly show you something?

04:11.146 --> 04:12.015
- Yes.

04:13.138 --> 04:15.842
- Now I don't mind getting stuck in, wow.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.086
Oh dear.

04:19.086 --> 04:20.632
- Oh dear, that is pretty bad.

04:20.632 --> 04:21.500
- [Gordon] Yeah, that's not very pleasant.

04:21.500 --> 04:23.930
- [Karen] That's not at all pleasant.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.015
- So.

04:25.015 --> 04:26.412
- Would you like to go to your room?

04:26.412 --> 04:27.507
- Yeah.

04:27.507 --> 04:29.237
- [Karen] Follow me this way.

04:29.237 --> 04:31.928
- Okay, how old is this place?

04:31.928 --> 04:34.607
- This hotel was built around 1880s.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.578
- I take it was decorated in 1880 as well.

04:36.578 --> 04:37.816
- It kind of looks that way.

04:37.816 --> 04:38.684
- [Gordon] For the first
time and the last time.

04:38.684 --> 04:40.332
- It's been a while for the rooms.

04:40.332 --> 04:41.792
There is a closet over here.

04:43.505 --> 04:44.795
- The special hangers just for me.

04:44.795 --> 04:45.948
- Yep.

04:45.948 --> 04:47.256
(Karen chuckling)

04:47.256 --> 04:48.151
- Well, well, well.

04:48.151 --> 04:49.323
- I think the coat will stay.

04:50.279 --> 04:51.148
- What is that?

04:53.668 --> 04:54.537
- Extra carpeting,

04:54.537 --> 04:56.536
we just got new carpet in here.

04:56.536 --> 04:59.279
- Okay so it's save for

04:59.279 --> 05:00.148
repairs.
- [Karen] Repairs.

05:00.148 --> 05:02.562
- I've never had free carpet
in my wardrobe before.

05:02.562 --> 05:04.442
Okay, just check my view.

05:05.661 --> 05:06.919
(exclaiming in disgust)

05:06.919 --> 05:08.237
Look at all those bugs

05:08.237 --> 05:10.531
and the blue bottle is
staying for the week?

05:13.323 --> 05:15.190
It's like a little
forest of them down here.

05:15.190 --> 05:17.723
We give these to your cleaner.

05:17.723 --> 05:18.592
Sorry.

05:19.924 --> 05:22.499
It's like an insect funeral home.

05:22.499 --> 05:23.552
- Truthfully in the fall,

05:23.552 --> 05:25.586
there was like a lady bug problem,

05:25.586 --> 05:27.056
bringing in guests and oh my gosh,

05:27.056 --> 05:28.484
they'd be like, 50 bugs in the room

05:28.484 --> 05:30.372
and so Ken and I would take care of that

05:30.372 --> 05:32.822
to get rid of lady bugs
for the people to stay,

05:34.094 --> 05:35.137
now they've died.

05:35.137 --> 05:36.409
- And look at this here,

05:37.525 --> 05:39.912
I think that's a cockroach, to welcome me

05:39.912 --> 05:42.043
on the toilet having a number two.

05:43.332 --> 05:44.813
- I'm just like, I can't believe it.

05:44.813 --> 05:48.212
- Look at that, I've never
had a cockroach committee

05:48.212 --> 05:50.246
welcome me on the job.

05:50.246 --> 05:51.674
Let's get out of there.

05:51.674 --> 05:52.904
Well, what else is on this floor?

05:52.904 --> 05:54.896
- Well, this is the owner's quarters.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.252
- And all these bits of furniture here,

05:56.252 --> 05:57.659
do people literally sit?

05:57.659 --> 05:59.202
- That seems to work well,

05:59.202 --> 06:00.780
for internet service out here.

06:01.924 --> 06:03.467
- Okay, so this is the wifi chair.

06:03.467 --> 06:04.739
- Yes, it really is.

06:04.739 --> 06:05.678
- I'm going to bear that in mind

06:05.678 --> 06:07.190
if I need to check my emails.

06:08.733 --> 06:11.103
- It's very sketchy at best.

06:11.103 --> 06:11.971
- Okay.

06:11.971 --> 06:13.884
- Far worse than I thought
through Gordon's eyes,

06:13.884 --> 06:16.167
I was like, whoa, it's totally neglected.

06:16.167 --> 06:20.386
- And I'll unpack and
get ready for dinner.

06:20.386 --> 06:21.255
- Okay.

06:23.070 --> 06:25.896
- [Gordon] Welcome to
Milford, I mean it's a joke.

06:25.896 --> 06:26.764
- [Staff] How did it go?

06:26.764 --> 06:28.686
- It was horrible, the place is filthy,

06:28.686 --> 06:30.390
filthy.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.028
- My first impressions of
the inn have been dreadful

06:33.028 --> 06:35.979
at least I can take my mind
off things with some TV,

06:35.979 --> 06:37.994
nothing, look at that,

06:38.961 --> 06:41.641
I knew those shitty hangers
would come in useful

06:41.641 --> 06:43.119
for something.

06:43.119 --> 06:44.884
Fuck it, come on,

06:44.884 --> 06:47.420
can't believe I missed
the Simpsons, come on.

06:48.458 --> 06:49.327
Damn.

06:50.879 --> 06:53.712
This is embarrassing,
$110 for this shit hole,

06:54.664 --> 06:58.869
just the general hygiene
cleanliness is just shocking,

07:00.149 --> 07:01.921
the wardrobe's full of crap

07:01.921 --> 07:05.414
and there's no excuse for dead insects

07:05.414 --> 07:06.447
and the filth everywhere.

07:06.447 --> 07:08.574
It's like they've given up

07:08.574 --> 07:10.055
and no one knows there's a hotel here,

07:10.055 --> 07:13.902
because it's just not fit
to rent these rooms out

07:13.902 --> 07:16.085
for the public, I mean, look at it.

07:17.503 --> 07:19.543
If this is what the bedrooms are like,

07:19.543 --> 07:22.405
God knows what dinner's going to be like.

07:22.405 --> 07:25.273
(dramatic music)

07:28.299 --> 07:31.003
So far at Milford,
Pennsylvania's River Rock Inn,

07:31.003 --> 07:33.589
I've discovered outdated
decor, bugs galore.

07:33.589 --> 07:37.009
Look at that, I've never
had a cockroach committee

07:37.009 --> 07:39.157
welcome me on the John.

07:39.157 --> 07:42.452
Got a TV that last worked in 1982.

07:42.452 --> 07:44.130
I've heard that the owner is a chef,

07:44.130 --> 07:46.007
so maybe the restaurant
will be the River Rock's

07:46.007 --> 07:46.876
saving grace.

07:46.876 --> 07:47.744
Okay.

07:51.002 --> 07:51.971
Good to see you.
- Nice to meet you.

07:51.971 --> 07:52.952
- And it's Ken, isn't it?

07:52.952 --> 07:53.820
- Yes, sir.

07:53.820 --> 07:55.433
- It says American bistro outside.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.302
- [Ken] Yes.

07:56.302 --> 07:57.300
- Is it a classic bistro?

07:57.300 --> 07:58.168
- Yes.

07:58.168 --> 07:59.521
Everything made from scratch.

07:59.521 --> 08:00.389
- That's nice.

08:00.389 --> 08:01.345
You're a chef by trade.

08:01.345 --> 08:02.554
- Yes I am.

08:02.554 --> 08:03.441
- You're not in the kitchen tonight?

08:03.441 --> 08:04.609
- No, I'm not working on the line.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.309
- So you've retired from cooking.

08:06.309 --> 08:07.226
- Somewhat.

08:07.226 --> 08:08.613
- Running the pass maybe, or?

08:08.613 --> 08:09.896
- I'm running the other side.

08:09.896 --> 08:11.136
I'm just watching all the food

08:11.136 --> 08:12.482
and letting people and
sending everything out.

08:12.482 --> 08:14.932
It's hard to run this
whole place by yourself.

08:14.932 --> 08:16.663
- I have so many years of experience,

08:16.663 --> 08:17.539
I thought that when he hired me

08:17.539 --> 08:19.582
he'd be able to let go a little bit

08:19.582 --> 08:21.094
knowing that I could get this job done,

08:21.094 --> 08:22.995
but he just can't seem to let go.

08:23.912 --> 08:25.849
- And how would you
rate the food one to 10?

08:25.849 --> 08:26.718
- Seven or eight.

08:26.718 --> 08:29.092
- And if I asked you to
rate your rooms out of 10

08:29.092 --> 08:30.281
what would you give them?

08:30.281 --> 08:31.740
- Four or five.

08:31.740 --> 08:34.659
- I'm now shitting myself about dinner.

08:34.659 --> 08:37.193
Let's hope that the food
is better than the rooms.

08:37.193 --> 08:38.062
- Sure.

08:39.801 --> 08:41.385
- The concept of an American bistro,

08:41.385 --> 08:43.523
serving fresh local food in a country inn,

08:43.523 --> 08:44.806
makes perfect sense,

08:44.806 --> 08:46.891
but I can't make any sense of this menu.

08:48.174 --> 08:49.268
See I'm getting a little bit confused,

08:49.268 --> 08:51.406
'cause we've gone Mexican
on the quesadillas.

08:51.406 --> 08:53.220
We've jumped down to Thailand

08:53.220 --> 08:56.286
and then we've gone
Italian for the calamari.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.409
What are we?

08:57.409 --> 08:58.277
Are we an American bistro?

08:58.277 --> 08:59.146
- Yes, sir.

08:59.146 --> 09:00.050
- Wow.

09:00.050 --> 09:01.197
What would you recommend on the menu?

09:01.197 --> 09:02.542
- We do a house smoked trout.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.231
I believe that it's our golden trout

09:04.231 --> 09:06.768
from Northern California, comes in frozen.

09:07.693 --> 09:10.800
- So you're recommending
that I eat frozen trout

09:10.800 --> 09:11.926
from Northern California.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.697
- You know, chef it's been
only frozen once right?

09:14.697 --> 09:16.838
- Your head is sweating.

09:16.838 --> 09:18.448
- It's a little hot in here sorry.

09:18.448 --> 09:19.316
- You're dripping yeah.

09:19.316 --> 09:20.185
- It's me, I'm sorry chef.

09:20.185 --> 09:21.758
- I know, I feel I've got
a leak in my fucking bath,

09:21.758 --> 09:22.920
is your bald head.

09:24.335 --> 09:25.638
Who puts these ideas together?

09:25.638 --> 09:27.828
- That would be Kenny chef.

09:27.828 --> 09:31.309
- Okay, so give me a Thai sampler plate.

09:31.309 --> 09:32.332
- Yes chef.

09:32.332 --> 09:34.345
- Entree, dying to see that.

09:34.345 --> 09:36.149
- The valdostano.

09:36.149 --> 09:38.098
- I'm travelling around
the globe in Milford.

09:38.098 --> 09:39.152
- Enjoy.

09:39.152 --> 09:41.810
- I'm appalled, I was
promised an American bistro,

09:41.810 --> 09:44.574
instead I get a sampling
from around the world.

09:44.574 --> 09:46.221
- I was expecting fresh food,

09:46.221 --> 09:48.348
but I get recommended frozen fish.

09:48.348 --> 09:49.308
What's going on here?

09:49.308 --> 09:50.559
- The Thai sampler chef.

09:51.841 --> 09:52.710
- Are they made in house?

09:52.710 --> 09:53.578
- No, they are not sir.

09:53.578 --> 09:54.615
- No, thank you James.

09:56.057 --> 09:58.838
(playful music)

10:01.758 --> 10:05.148
- Wow, it's just frozen crap, reheated

10:05.148 --> 10:08.170
and how can you make a slice
of chicken look so bland?

10:08.170 --> 10:11.135
I wouldn't give that Thai
experience to my fucking dog.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.854
- [Ken] L six is on the fire too.

10:14.854 --> 10:16.725
- James, I'm struggling.

10:16.725 --> 10:17.674
- [James] Yes sir.

10:17.674 --> 10:19.411
- Where's the chef
from, is he a local boy?

10:19.411 --> 10:20.370
- Yes he is.

10:20.370 --> 10:23.352
I think left to his own
devices, he'd do very well.

10:23.352 --> 10:26.459
He's very limited on what he
can use for ingredient wise

10:26.459 --> 10:28.044
because he doesn't do the shopping.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.097
- [Gordon] Who does the shopping now?

10:29.097 --> 10:30.098
- Kenny does the shopping.

10:30.098 --> 10:31.368
- [Gordon] So he's almost like cut

10:31.368 --> 10:32.237
the balls of the chef off.

10:32.237 --> 10:33.106
- [James] Yes sir.

10:33.106 --> 10:34.488
- [Ken] M six, M14.

10:34.488 --> 10:36.928
- The menu at the River Rock
is pretty much outdated.

10:36.928 --> 10:39.775
It's Kenny's menu, it's
been here for years.

10:39.775 --> 10:41.912
I don't agree with the
menu, but he's my boss,

10:41.912 --> 10:44.133
he pays my salary and it's
still gonna get to that point

10:44.133 --> 10:46.010
where you're just kind of burnt out.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.515
- Hi Gordon, Annmarie how are you?

10:50.515 --> 10:52.322
- Tough on this one, what'd you do here?

10:52.322 --> 10:53.997
- I bartend and I help manage.

10:53.997 --> 10:55.672
- Ken's the chef.
- Correct.

10:55.672 --> 10:56.540
- And a chef that's cooking

10:56.540 --> 10:57.998
is not allowed to cook his own dishes.

10:57.998 --> 10:58.867
- Yeah.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.952
- It's almost like he's
sort of cut his balls off.

11:00.952 --> 11:03.100
- Well, it's kinda what
he does with all of us.

11:03.100 --> 11:04.508
- Oh really?

11:04.508 --> 11:06.176
- He deflates you, strips your confidence,

11:06.176 --> 11:09.701
won't let you make any decisions
executive, or otherwise.

11:09.701 --> 11:10.570
- It's crazy, I mean-

11:10.570 --> 11:11.921
- It's a lot of micromanagement.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.100
- Why do you stay here?

11:13.100 --> 11:15.123
- I'm a loyal dog, unfortunately,

11:15.123 --> 11:16.614
I'd bend over backwards for him,

11:16.614 --> 11:18.869
but that bone's wearing thin.

11:21.045 --> 11:23.506
- [Ken] Faldo, that's for chef Ramsey.

11:23.506 --> 11:26.116
- [Man] That might be the golden ticket.

11:26.116 --> 11:26.984
- Wow.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.305
Thank you.

11:31.305 --> 11:32.452
Thank you.

11:32.452 --> 11:33.999
Jesus Christ all mighty.

11:35.289 --> 11:36.759
Looks like someone's just
dropped a fucking T-Rex

11:36.759 --> 11:37.951
foot on my plate.

11:39.617 --> 11:40.517
Holy crap.

11:40.517 --> 11:41.385
- That's the valdostano chef.

11:41.385 --> 11:42.254
- Honestly.

11:42.254 --> 11:44.412
- In fact that might be
a small valdostano chef.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.076
- Oh, that's a small one.

11:46.076 --> 11:47.874
- Yes sir.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.761
- I mean, it's like a meal for eight.

11:49.761 --> 11:52.462
- That valdostano can
feed an Ethiopian family

11:52.462 --> 11:54.467
of 40 you know what I mean?

11:55.423 --> 11:57.603
- Horrific, this is
not what I would expect

11:57.603 --> 12:00.981
in a country inn, it's worse
than a nasty roadside diner.

12:00.981 --> 12:04.057
I feel like I'm eating a fucking
flip flop with mayonnaise.

12:11.846 --> 12:13.817
Ken the owner, looks like a zombie

12:13.817 --> 12:15.912
sleep walking towards disaster.

12:15.912 --> 12:17.445
It's time to get everyone together

12:17.445 --> 12:19.082
and see if I can wake Ken up.

12:19.082 --> 12:21.720
How much money are you losing per month?

12:21.720 --> 12:23.976
Right now about five to 7,000 a month.

12:24.967 --> 12:26.154
- And that's on the decline.

12:26.154 --> 12:27.056
- Correct.

12:27.056 --> 12:28.634
- If those rooms aren't that busy,

12:28.634 --> 12:31.035
why are they so disgustingly dirty?

12:32.651 --> 12:35.568
- They're dirty because
I didn't check them.

12:35.568 --> 12:38.219
- It's almost like
we're robbing customers.

12:40.291 --> 12:42.053
When I arrived you gave your food

12:43.001 --> 12:44.725
seven or eight out of 10.

12:44.725 --> 12:45.635
- Yes.

12:45.635 --> 12:46.504
- But the food was dreadful.

12:48.156 --> 12:49.025
Seth, how long have you been cooking?

12:49.025 --> 12:49.936
- Almost 18 years.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.771
- As a chef, 18 years in the business.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.776
Are you proud of what you serve?

12:56.151 --> 12:57.089
- Personally, I don't (indistinct),

12:57.089 --> 12:58.396
it's Kenny's menu, it's
what's on the menu so.

12:59.818 --> 13:00.686
- I want what I want, I know what I want,

13:00.686 --> 13:03.439
you can't hold people's
hands in this business.

13:03.439 --> 13:06.435
- If you don't fix this inn,
they've all lost their job.

13:08.507 --> 13:10.248
- I honestly think that
Kenny needs somebody

13:10.248 --> 13:12.813
to open his eyes, so that
he can see that everybody

13:12.813 --> 13:15.920
that works for him is
capable and we're dependable

13:15.920 --> 13:18.277
and we're here to help
him increase his business

13:18.277 --> 13:20.852
and make it successful and
nobody's here to hurt him.

13:20.852 --> 13:22.180
- I'm here to help.

13:23.689 --> 13:27.630
It's impossible, 'cause you
are not helping yourself

13:28.673 --> 13:31.207
and it's not as if you're
the captain of the Titanic,

13:31.207 --> 13:32.701
you're the fucking iceberg.

13:34.094 --> 13:34.962
(dramatic music)

13:34.962 --> 13:36.563
Yet you haven't stared
at yourself long enough

13:36.563 --> 13:38.724
in the mirror and actually
understood where the issues are.

13:38.724 --> 13:39.924
You're looking at them.

13:41.562 --> 13:44.569
(dramatic music)

13:44.569 --> 13:45.525
Good night.

13:47.263 --> 13:48.132
Fuck me.

13:49.838 --> 13:51.550
Oh Jesus.

13:51.550 --> 13:53.739
I've had about all I can take for one day.

13:55.387 --> 13:58.984
It's time to get to bed,
but based on how neglected

13:58.984 --> 14:00.924
these rooms are, I need to know exactly

14:00.924 --> 14:01.987
what I'm sleeping on.

14:01.987 --> 14:04.532
My black light will
reveal any bodily fluids,

14:04.532 --> 14:06.804
previous guests have left behind.

14:06.804 --> 14:07.952
Let's start off on the bed.

14:11.154 --> 14:14.667
Oh Jesus Christ, that has got to be semen.

14:14.667 --> 14:16.714
This is hotel hell.

14:17.938 --> 14:21.090
(woman screaming)

14:21.090 --> 14:23.259
Before my first night sleeping
at the River Rock Inn,

14:23.259 --> 14:24.739
in Milford, Pennsylvania,

14:24.739 --> 14:26.971
I decided to check it
out with my black light

14:26.971 --> 14:30.014
to make sure there was
nothing I wasn't seeing.

14:30.014 --> 14:30.883
(dramatic music)

14:30.883 --> 14:33.091
And I was appalled to
discover a vast spread

14:33.091 --> 14:35.369
of bodily fluid stains.

14:35.369 --> 14:36.237
Has this thing ever been washed?

14:36.237 --> 14:39.601
People pay to sleep in this bed,

14:40.772 --> 14:42.903
unfucking believable.

14:42.903 --> 14:45.208
There is no way I'm sleeping
on these sheets tonight.

14:45.208 --> 14:46.702
Luckily I came prepared.

14:53.528 --> 14:55.732
Oh shit, I forgot to turn off the lights.

14:59.618 --> 15:03.282
(gentle upbeat music)

15:03.282 --> 15:04.706
Oh man, that was rough.

15:06.691 --> 15:07.960
Hopefully a shower will
wash away the memory

15:07.960 --> 15:09.412
of those awful stains.

15:13.893 --> 15:14.761
Shit.

15:15.932 --> 15:18.885
Look at this thing.

15:18.885 --> 15:22.005
Fuck me, it's like being
in Danny Devito's house.

15:22.005 --> 15:23.308
You're a shower, come on.

15:29.056 --> 15:34.148
I feel dirtier now as I did
before I got in here, shit.

15:34.148 --> 15:36.007
It's freezing.

15:36.007 --> 15:38.031
(gentle upbeat music)

15:38.031 --> 15:40.617
I don't think the staff,
or the owner have any idea

15:40.617 --> 15:43.599
how revolting it is to be a guest here.

15:43.599 --> 15:44.835
I want you to come upstairs with me,

15:44.835 --> 15:45.709
I want to show you something,

15:45.709 --> 15:46.577
please, all of you.

15:46.577 --> 15:47.857
Time for a wake-up call.

15:51.222 --> 15:52.695
Good morning.

15:52.695 --> 15:53.742
- [Group] Good morning.

15:53.742 --> 15:55.518
- These are the guests that
have been staying in the hotel.

15:55.518 --> 15:58.187
Now you've all experienced
over the last 24 hours,

15:58.187 --> 16:00.929
a sleep over and what I'm here to do

16:00.929 --> 16:03.302
is to help fix this place.

16:03.302 --> 16:05.621
I can't do it without your feedback.

16:05.621 --> 16:07.613
- My biggest complaint was this morning

16:07.613 --> 16:10.950
when I took a shower, I
had water up to my ankles

16:10.950 --> 16:12.117
before I got out.

16:12.117 --> 16:13.963
- My shower head, I probably showered

16:13.963 --> 16:17.133
from here down 'cause the
shower head hit me about here.

16:17.133 --> 16:19.333
- There was like bugs on the floor

16:19.333 --> 16:21.825
and then I was sitting on the bed

16:21.825 --> 16:23.900
and then I saw a bug on the door too.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.987
- I have back problems and this morning

16:25.987 --> 16:26.855
it was really hard to get out of bed,

16:26.855 --> 16:29.385
just cause you could feel the springs.

16:29.385 --> 16:31.418
- The big question for
me is that on the back

16:31.418 --> 16:34.852
of last nights experience,
who would stay here again?

16:36.138 --> 16:37.414
(dramatic music)

16:37.414 --> 16:38.665
A little raise of hands.

16:40.740 --> 16:43.586
- I probably wouldn't come to stay again.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.133
- Really, no one?

16:48.039 --> 16:48.907
Thank you very much indeed.

16:48.907 --> 16:49.776
- [Group] Thank you.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.793
- I hope Kenny's starting to
see how his lack of effort

16:51.793 --> 16:53.795
at the inn is driving guests away.

16:53.795 --> 16:55.630
There's one more thing I want to show him,

16:55.630 --> 16:58.163
if this doesn't wake him up, nothing will.

16:58.163 --> 17:01.733
I wanna show you something
that is pretty horrific.

17:03.971 --> 17:07.357
Come in, just stand over
there please three of you.

17:15.273 --> 17:16.143
Glasses on.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.709
(menacing music)

17:19.709 --> 17:20.637
Brace yourself Karen.

17:23.933 --> 17:25.411
- Oh my goodness.

17:27.358 --> 17:29.001
I'm disgusted.

17:29.001 --> 17:30.029
It's awful, I don't even like to think of

17:30.029 --> 17:32.072
what I'm even looking at.

17:32.072 --> 17:33.584
- It's like a fucking galaxy.

17:34.563 --> 17:36.413
- This is foul, absolutely foul.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.371
I'm shell-shocked a little
bit, it's disgusting.

17:39.371 --> 17:41.134
It's truly disgusting.

17:41.134 --> 17:43.942
- Just seeing this makes
me sick to my stomach.

17:45.044 --> 17:47.181
- Oh dear, I don't know what to say.

17:47.181 --> 17:48.210
I mean, I'm just..

17:49.197 --> 17:50.065
- It is, it's a horror show.

17:51.709 --> 17:52.577
It was horrifying, I was thinking

17:52.577 --> 17:54.730
how many times would this
room even been rented

17:54.730 --> 17:57.601
without being cleaned,
for all that to be there?

17:58.983 --> 18:02.116
- Ken, you're running a
fucking hotel, not a brothel.

18:03.299 --> 18:04.834
It is fucking disgusting.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.079
Start taking responsibility.

18:08.172 --> 18:11.039
(dramatic music)

18:24.813 --> 18:26.429
I've discovered some disgusting things

18:26.429 --> 18:28.274
at the River Rock Inn.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.195
Horrific food.

18:30.735 --> 18:31.955
I wouldn't give that to my fucking dog,

18:31.955 --> 18:34.051
dead bugs like an insect funeral home,

18:34.051 --> 18:37.012
and I've worked out what the
source of all the problems is,

18:37.012 --> 18:37.933
it's Ken.

18:38.895 --> 18:40.526
It's not as if you're the
captain of the Titanic,

18:40.526 --> 18:42.052
you're the fucking iceberg.

18:45.396 --> 18:46.699
He's in way over his head

18:46.699 --> 18:49.494
and making everyone's
life miserable as a result

18:49.494 --> 18:51.443
and his incompetence has let the inn

18:51.443 --> 18:53.209
fall into a shocking state.

18:56.313 --> 18:58.255
Looks like a fucking galaxy.

18:59.424 --> 19:00.293
- It's awful, I don't even like to think

19:00.293 --> 19:02.093
of what I'm even looking at.

19:02.093 --> 19:03.073
- This is truly disgusting.

19:05.487 --> 19:06.771
It's a true slap in the face.

19:06.771 --> 19:09.611
I apologise to everybody
who slept there before.

19:11.294 --> 19:14.227
that I put you through
that, I think it's horrible.

19:14.227 --> 19:16.562
- I hope Ken realises
now, that there's more

19:16.562 --> 19:18.828
to running an inn, than
just owning an inn.

19:20.431 --> 19:23.124
This place needs to
change and change fast.

19:25.259 --> 19:27.242
- [Woman] Karen.
- Yes.

19:27.242 --> 19:28.650
- [Woman] We need garbage bags.

19:28.650 --> 19:29.711
- Elise just went to get some.

19:29.711 --> 19:31.953
- First up, the inn needs to be cleaned,

19:31.953 --> 19:34.507
so it's a place fit for
paying guests to stay in.

19:35.446 --> 19:36.812
I put the whole team to work

19:36.812 --> 19:38.636
to clean the inn from top to bottom

19:41.441 --> 19:44.757
and I'm going to address
the worst problem myself.

19:44.757 --> 19:45.626
Hello, Madam.

19:45.626 --> 19:46.512
- Hi, how are you?

19:47.389 --> 19:48.295
- Very well, thank you.

19:48.295 --> 19:50.628
Is there any chance I can
put this through a wash?

19:50.628 --> 19:51.775
- Yes, when do you need it by?

19:51.775 --> 19:53.252
- By tonight

19:53.252 --> 19:54.549
if that's possible.
- Yes definitely.

19:54.549 --> 19:55.570
- Would you mind?

19:55.570 --> 19:58.132
But can you do a sort of
extra strong cleaning product?

19:58.132 --> 19:59.772
It's pretty rancid.

19:59.772 --> 20:01.241
- Okay.

20:01.241 --> 20:02.110
- So be careful.

20:02.110 --> 20:04.432
- Will be done, thank you.

20:04.432 --> 20:06.480
- Bye bye, careful you
don't catch anything.

20:09.421 --> 20:12.115
(gentle music)

20:17.926 --> 20:20.411
Wow, the place is looking so fresh.

20:21.924 --> 20:23.721
While the staff finish cleaning the inn,

20:23.721 --> 20:25.856
I want to have a snoop around the kitchen

20:25.856 --> 20:27.277
and see if there's anymore clues

20:27.277 --> 20:28.196
as to how Ken is running this place.

20:28.196 --> 20:30.848
Notes everywhere, who
writes notes like this?

20:31.794 --> 20:35.329
Why do I have to ask weekly
for the fish to be iced down?

20:35.329 --> 20:37.789
Do not take this sign down.

20:37.789 --> 20:39.930
Do not take my pens, buy your own.

20:40.890 --> 20:42.680
If you use this drill, replace it,

20:42.680 --> 20:44.817
or I'll buy a new one with your paycheck.

20:45.808 --> 20:47.229
Bloody hell, charming.

20:48.456 --> 20:50.740
Ken definitely has issues, bloody hell,

20:52.094 --> 20:53.628
if you eat these cookies,

20:53.628 --> 20:55.915
take one to your next job interview.

20:56.913 --> 20:58.407
I mean, my God.

21:00.108 --> 21:02.554
I'm surprised anyone
still fucking works here.

21:02.554 --> 21:05.758
This guy is incredible.

21:06.643 --> 21:08.038
That's not management.

21:08.038 --> 21:09.456
This is insane.

21:09.456 --> 21:12.960
I can't believe Ken is so passive
aggressive with his staff.

21:12.960 --> 21:15.012
I need to talk to him and find out

21:15.012 --> 21:16.397
what the hell is going on.

21:16.397 --> 21:17.610
I come across all these little notes about

21:17.610 --> 21:20.791
don't take this, if you do
take it to the next interview,

21:20.791 --> 21:22.251
you tell me what's going on?

21:23.919 --> 21:26.424
- I don't like being taken advantage of.

21:27.506 --> 21:30.008
I have some hard times
with things that they do.

21:31.595 --> 21:33.147
- Why aren't you talking to them?

21:33.147 --> 21:34.940
Why are you leading them?

21:34.940 --> 21:36.223
Why aren't you motivating them?

21:36.223 --> 21:38.343
Why aren't you getting close to them?

21:39.716 --> 21:41.843
The secret of any good
management's about communication,

21:41.843 --> 21:45.193
understanding and put
yourself on their level.

21:46.746 --> 21:49.395
- Maybe I look at it as
they should be on my level.

21:50.747 --> 21:51.615
- Who you kidding?

21:53.839 --> 21:56.055
- Come with me, I wanna
show you something.

21:56.055 --> 21:57.703
Take a seat here.

21:57.703 --> 22:01.352
Ken thinks he's his staff, but
I think he's bullying them.

22:01.352 --> 22:03.438
He needs to see how he's making them feel.

22:03.438 --> 22:05.711
I've set up a monitor
in one of the bedrooms

22:05.711 --> 22:09.214
and I'm going to force Ken
to watch a staff meeting.

22:09.214 --> 22:11.017
I think this might bring about the change

22:11.017 --> 22:12.388
this place desperately needs.

22:12.388 --> 22:14.056
Stay here, I'll be back in five.

22:19.620 --> 22:20.770
I came here to help.

22:22.548 --> 22:24.990
What I'm frustrated about
is what I'm discovering.

22:24.990 --> 22:26.919
I snooped around the kitchen,

22:26.919 --> 22:30.520
I come across this, a cookie jar.

22:31.601 --> 22:33.356
If you eat these cookies,

22:34.895 --> 22:36.772
take one to your next job interview.

22:38.358 --> 22:40.290
- We call those Kenny's nastygrams.

22:42.803 --> 22:44.555
- I mean, is this a joke or?

22:44.555 --> 22:45.920
- No that's Ken.

22:45.920 --> 22:46.788
- No, that's real.

22:46.788 --> 22:49.223
- I put those notes up because
my staff needs reminders

22:49.223 --> 22:52.852
for me to tell them to
do the simplest tasks.

22:52.852 --> 22:55.229
They tend to come off as degrading,

22:55.229 --> 22:59.118
but I don't know if they
get the hint any other way.

22:59.118 --> 23:01.078
- What in the hell is going on?

23:01.078 --> 23:01.965
Look at this one.

23:03.017 --> 23:05.600
Don't take my pens, buy your own.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.376
- I think he hides behind,
he's afraid of confrontation.

23:07.376 --> 23:08.961
- It's passive aggressive stuff.

23:08.961 --> 23:10.651
- How does that make you feel?

23:10.651 --> 23:12.809
- He causes us all to be discouraged

23:12.809 --> 23:14.924
in the jobs that we have,

23:14.924 --> 23:15.792
there's so many people here that really

23:15.792 --> 23:19.149
know their jobs well, but
we have become discouraged

23:19.149 --> 23:21.088
and when people become discouraged

23:21.088 --> 23:23.382
they don't do the things
that are necessary.

23:25.812 --> 23:27.344
- There's no gratitude.

23:27.344 --> 23:30.598
Like, so when you say to
us, why are we like this?

23:30.598 --> 23:33.079
We're just spiritless he's
really just sucked the soul

23:33.079 --> 23:34.209
on every one of us.

23:35.988 --> 23:37.865
He's just a spirit sucker, honestly.

23:39.603 --> 23:42.471
(dramatic music)

23:45.602 --> 23:48.355
- I've locked Ken, the owner
of Milford's River Rock Inn,

23:48.355 --> 23:51.905
into a bedroom where he can
watch a staff meeting on TV.

23:51.905 --> 23:52.774
- If you eat these cookies,

23:52.774 --> 23:54.976
take one to your next job interview.

23:54.976 --> 23:57.437
The staff have told me
his management style has

23:57.437 --> 23:58.448
destroyed their morale.

23:58.448 --> 23:59.449
Is this a joke?

23:59.449 --> 24:01.006
- No, that's him.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.912
There's no gratitude.

24:03.912 --> 24:07.165
Like, so when you say to
us, why are we like us?

24:07.165 --> 24:09.251
We're just spiritless
he's really just sucked

24:09.251 --> 24:11.659
the soul out of every
one of us individually,

24:11.659 --> 24:14.079
over the period and length of time.

24:14.079 --> 24:15.903
He's just a spirit sucker honestly.

24:18.760 --> 24:20.377
- Annmarie's comments about me,

24:20.377 --> 24:22.665
brought tears to my eyes.

24:22.665 --> 24:25.674
Her especially because she's
one of my closest friends

24:25.674 --> 24:27.039
and it did hurt me.

24:27.039 --> 24:29.313
- What do you want to see change from him?

24:29.313 --> 24:30.950
- Let the people in his team,

24:30.950 --> 24:33.598
do the work that he's hired us to do.

24:33.598 --> 24:35.611
- This place can succeed.

24:35.611 --> 24:38.488
Providing that you stay on track.

24:38.488 --> 24:42.075
You've got to stand up to him.

24:42.075 --> 24:43.222
Let me go and get him.

24:46.174 --> 24:48.071
I hope that seeing that,
finally got through to Ken.

24:48.071 --> 24:49.739
It's time to reveal to the staff

24:49.739 --> 24:52.127
that he was upstairs watching every word.

24:52.127 --> 24:55.568
- Wow, of what my staff thinks about me,

24:55.568 --> 24:57.834
it's awakening.

24:58.707 --> 25:02.596
It really saddens me because,
I would do anything for them

25:02.596 --> 25:04.778
and I feel that they don't see that.

25:08.435 --> 25:09.648
I need to change.

25:11.574 --> 25:14.107
I watched everything you said

25:16.871 --> 25:19.533
and I apologise.

25:23.721 --> 25:26.276
I never wanted to suck
the life out of any of you

25:27.911 --> 25:31.010
and I think I control this place,

25:31.010 --> 25:33.797
but realise maybe I don't need to control.

25:35.525 --> 25:37.474
- You have a good team here

25:37.474 --> 25:39.351
and if we are going to move forward,

25:41.049 --> 25:43.533
you have to give them
ownership of their own areas.

25:43.533 --> 25:44.461
Seth.

25:44.461 --> 25:46.015
- Yep.

25:46.015 --> 25:47.061
- You've got to get that mojo back

25:47.061 --> 25:47.930
and with falling back in love

25:47.930 --> 25:49.466
with what you've employed to do.

25:50.967 --> 25:54.575
Karen you care and that's
what being a good innkeeper,

25:54.575 --> 25:56.132
that little personal touch.

25:57.838 --> 26:01.415
You should have a hold on
the inside of this business,

26:01.415 --> 26:04.283
and sort of filling the place,
like the inn hotel manager,

26:04.283 --> 26:06.941
so I want you to have that
level of responsibility.

26:09.797 --> 26:12.679
- I think what I learned the most was that

26:12.679 --> 26:15.221
I need to give people the
opportunity to run this place,

26:15.221 --> 26:17.911
I can't micromanage like I always did.

26:17.911 --> 26:19.537
- I really hope that he backs off

26:19.537 --> 26:21.237
and lets us all into our jobs,

26:21.237 --> 26:23.541
he just has to put the faith in us

26:23.541 --> 26:25.557
and I know that our team
can accomplish anything.

26:29.686 --> 26:31.904
(dramatic music)

26:31.904 --> 26:34.813
- I think Ken's warming
to the idea of change

26:34.813 --> 26:36.534
but I don't feel I've got to the heart

26:36.534 --> 26:39.401
of why he looks like a man
under such extreme pressure.

26:40.944 --> 26:43.249
Kenny, you got two minutes?

26:43.249 --> 26:44.625
- Sure thing.

26:44.625 --> 26:45.698
- Can I come in?

26:45.698 --> 26:46.566
- Come on in.

26:46.566 --> 26:48.441
- There's got to be
more to this than money.

26:49.505 --> 26:50.840
Yesterday in many ways,

26:50.840 --> 26:53.154
I started to believe you'd given up,

26:53.154 --> 26:56.428
today we turned the corner,
we gotta stay on that track.

26:56.428 --> 27:00.756
- I thought I could control
this place and it didn't work.

27:00.756 --> 27:01.892
It's not working.

27:01.892 --> 27:03.279
- It seems like the pressure you're under,

27:03.279 --> 27:04.791
is not just financial, right?

27:05.750 --> 27:07.429
- In order to buy this place,

27:07.429 --> 27:09.613
I borrowed from my brother.

27:09.613 --> 27:10.971
I said, "I think I can
really make this work.

27:10.971 --> 27:13.494
"And the price is affordable.

27:13.494 --> 27:14.537
"Would you help me?"

27:15.752 --> 27:17.616
After we met with the owners,

27:17.616 --> 27:21.066
he went to the truck says
"How much do you want me

27:21.066 --> 27:21.934
"to write the check out for?"

27:24.029 --> 27:24.898
He's my idol,

27:26.949 --> 27:28.773
my mother too, my mother,

27:28.773 --> 27:31.326
I wouldn't happen without her help either.

27:31.326 --> 27:34.863
I said, I can move to this
restaurant, to this place

27:34.863 --> 27:37.840
and the only way I could
do it is I need some money

27:37.840 --> 27:39.195
from you, I needed $50,000

27:40.764 --> 27:43.618
and she also said, "Just take it".

27:45.436 --> 27:48.317
So both their houses are tied into here.

27:51.014 --> 27:53.225
- So if this place fails,

27:53.225 --> 27:56.731
you have let them down and yourself.

27:58.292 --> 28:01.462
- This entire place wouldn't be here,

28:01.462 --> 28:04.280
without my brother and my mother's help.

28:04.280 --> 28:05.153
I want the businesses to succeed

28:05.153 --> 28:06.874
so they don't have to have a worry.

28:06.874 --> 28:08.699
I don't want to ever let them down.

28:09.849 --> 28:11.732
- And you can't do it alone.

28:11.732 --> 28:12.802
- Yeah I know.

28:12.802 --> 28:13.696
- Do you have a girlfriend in here or?

28:14.569 --> 28:15.570
- No, no.

28:15.570 --> 28:16.706
- Don't take this the wrong way,

28:16.706 --> 28:19.459
but it needs a woman's touch.

28:19.459 --> 28:21.555
It needs a bit of a feminine approach.

28:21.555 --> 28:24.225
It needs that kind of love, no?

28:24.225 --> 28:25.825
- Yes,

28:25.825 --> 28:27.121
it's been kind of rough,

28:27.121 --> 28:28.114
there's been no lady in my life because

28:28.114 --> 28:30.908
I haven't even had a chance go out there

28:30.908 --> 28:33.432
and even meet or date women.

28:33.432 --> 28:36.349
I just want to meet that special person.

28:36.349 --> 28:37.585
- And just big deep breath.

28:39.164 --> 28:41.043
- It's the first time I smiled in a while.

28:41.043 --> 28:41.912
- Good.

28:47.248 --> 28:48.937
The River Rock Inn, has come a long way

28:48.937 --> 28:49.969
from where we started.

28:49.969 --> 28:52.315
The once filthy inn, is now clean

28:52.315 --> 28:54.911
and Ken the owner has seen
the error of his ways.

28:54.911 --> 28:55.989
- I apologise.

28:56.945 --> 28:59.343
I never wanted to suck
the life at any of you.

29:00.329 --> 29:01.950
- But before this place
is ready to welcome guests

29:01.950 --> 29:04.202
the staff need to
understand the true meaning

29:04.202 --> 29:06.051
of hospitality.

29:06.051 --> 29:07.798
This place is definitely
the road to recovery,

29:07.798 --> 29:09.061
but I think this team needs some training,

29:09.061 --> 29:10.729
so I've asked a very special friend.

29:10.729 --> 29:13.026
Ramesh Sebwany, from Caesar's Palace,

29:15.203 --> 29:16.996
to actually show them how it's done.

29:16.996 --> 29:18.372
- Hi Gordon.

29:18.372 --> 29:19.962
Good to see you.

29:19.962 --> 29:21.077
How are you?

29:21.077 --> 29:22.694
- Very well indeed thank you, how are you?

29:22.694 --> 29:23.563
- I'm great.

29:23.563 --> 29:24.432
- Please take a seat.

29:24.432 --> 29:25.419
It's so nice to see you.

29:25.419 --> 29:26.422
- It's great to see you.

29:26.422 --> 29:29.039
- So the customer focus
is critical isn't it?

29:29.039 --> 29:30.165
- Very much.

29:30.165 --> 29:32.324
- In your mind, what are the golden rules

29:33.816 --> 29:35.226
on the first 60 seconds?

29:36.139 --> 29:38.012
- You have to approach your
guests with a big smile

29:38.012 --> 29:40.186
on your face because that
just opens all kinds of doors.

29:40.186 --> 29:42.991
Find little ways to make
a lasting impression

29:42.991 --> 29:45.420
on that guest and let them
know that their comfort

29:45.420 --> 29:47.495
and their enjoyment is
your primary objective.

29:47.495 --> 29:50.012
- And it sounds simple, but
it's not that simple is it?

29:50.012 --> 29:51.166
- No if you practise all the basics,

29:51.166 --> 29:53.011
the rest of it will just fall into play.

29:53.011 --> 29:54.957
It has to be a natural,

29:54.957 --> 29:56.129
people know when you're not being sincere.

29:56.129 --> 29:57.537
- The good news is the team here,

29:57.537 --> 29:59.686
their heart is in the right place,

29:59.686 --> 30:01.040
but they are clearly lacking training,

30:01.040 --> 30:03.324
the owner doesn't smile that often, so.

30:03.324 --> 30:04.252
- Okay, all right.

30:04.252 --> 30:05.148
- Let me go get the team.

30:05.148 --> 30:06.566
- Okay.

30:06.566 --> 30:07.435
- Thanks Ramesh.

30:09.068 --> 30:10.383
Kevin, I've got someone very special,

30:10.383 --> 30:12.885
I want to introduce you
to, please come through.

30:14.139 --> 30:17.327
I'd like to introduce you to
a dear friend of mine, please.

30:19.171 --> 30:20.039
- My name is Ramesh.

30:20.039 --> 30:21.132
- Ramesh.

30:21.132 --> 30:22.458
- My name's Karen.
- Very nice to meet you.

30:22.458 --> 30:25.076
- He's from Caesar's Palace
and he's flown in from Vegas.

30:25.076 --> 30:26.208
- Oh my goodness.

30:26.208 --> 30:27.504
- I asked Ramesh to come and teach you

30:27.504 --> 30:29.603
how to greet customers.

30:31.166 --> 30:33.865
- Holy mackerel, he's the guy
that runs Caesar's Palace,

30:33.865 --> 30:36.933
coming to teach my staff,
how lucky of a guy am I?

30:38.379 --> 30:41.122
- He's here to help you and
to show you within 60 seconds

30:41.122 --> 30:42.947
of those guests arriving
through that door,

30:42.947 --> 30:44.532
what we need to hit,

30:44.532 --> 30:49.182
first impressions go wrong,
they never forget it, okay?

30:49.182 --> 30:51.288
Why don't we have a look
at what they normally do.

30:51.288 --> 30:53.123
Stop straight away and we'll restart.

30:53.123 --> 30:53.992
- Okay.

30:58.910 --> 31:03.109
- Stop, as soon as you see a
guest coming through there,

31:03.109 --> 31:04.103
you can come out here
and reach for the door,

31:04.103 --> 31:06.606
open the door and have a
big smile on your face.

31:07.527 --> 31:08.486
- It looked like you just lost your arm.

31:09.786 --> 31:10.655
Here we go.

31:13.123 --> 31:13.991
- Bollocks.

31:14.952 --> 31:16.051
(vinyl record scratching)

31:16.051 --> 31:16.942
(buzzing)

31:16.942 --> 31:18.108
- Okay, put a lot more into it.

31:18.108 --> 31:19.154
- Okay.

31:19.154 --> 31:20.022
- It's gotta be good afternoon,

31:20.022 --> 31:21.850
it's great to have you here, welcome.

31:21.850 --> 31:23.899
- It was kind of hard,

31:23.899 --> 31:26.031
I'm going to work to get
better at greeting people.

31:26.031 --> 31:27.992
Good afternoon, nice to have you here,

31:27.992 --> 31:30.190
welcome to the River Rock Inn.

31:30.190 --> 31:31.791
- Thank you very much.

31:31.791 --> 31:32.660
- Stop.

31:32.660 --> 31:33.528
(buzzing)

31:33.528 --> 31:35.041
Before he extends his hand out to you,

31:35.041 --> 31:36.637
you should have extended
your hand out to him.

31:36.637 --> 31:38.554
- I feel like I'm being
yelled at by a drill Sergeant.

31:38.554 --> 31:41.203
- You're out, on the
stairs, Karen your turn.

31:41.203 --> 31:43.145
- Karen you have an incredible smile.

31:44.411 --> 31:45.501
- I was a little nervous.

31:45.501 --> 31:47.007
Gordon's in the back of he's chanting,

31:47.007 --> 31:48.283
"You could do this, you could do this"

31:48.283 --> 31:49.151
giving a pep talk.

31:49.151 --> 31:51.703
- [Gordon] Here we go.

31:51.703 --> 31:52.850
- Good afternoon I'm Karen,

31:52.850 --> 31:54.205
welcome to the River Rock.

31:55.279 --> 31:56.148
- Good afternoon, my
name's James Sanfilippo.

31:56.148 --> 31:57.017
I'm here to check in.

31:57.017 --> 31:58.755
- Welcome Mr Sanfilippo,
come right this way.

31:59.909 --> 32:02.193
I see that you'll be staying
with us for the next week.

32:02.193 --> 32:04.342
- Yes, ma'am possibly more.

32:04.342 --> 32:05.210
- Of course, that would be wonderful.

32:05.210 --> 32:07.364
We have used staying
in our king size room,

32:07.364 --> 32:08.730
which is on the second floor.

32:08.730 --> 32:11.380
Absolutely lovely room with a pretty view

32:11.380 --> 32:13.641
out the front of the house,
so that's a nice place to be.

32:13.641 --> 32:15.359
- Nice.

32:15.359 --> 32:18.137
(cheering and clapping)

32:18.137 --> 32:19.046
Finally, amazing.

32:20.236 --> 32:23.132
- Karen is a superstar, she really is.

32:23.132 --> 32:24.559
- That was very well done.

32:24.559 --> 32:26.251
- Gordon helped me realise,

32:27.539 --> 32:28.928
that I have people that I can rely on

32:28.928 --> 32:32.069
and instead of being the hands-on owner,

32:32.942 --> 32:35.523
I should be more the overseeing owner,

32:35.523 --> 32:37.056
which I really need to be.

32:37.056 --> 32:38.122
Very well done.

32:38.122 --> 32:38.991
- Right.

32:40.745 --> 32:43.254
(dramatic music)

32:43.254 --> 32:44.839
Now that Remesh has
taught the staff how to

32:44.839 --> 32:46.456
make the right first impression,

32:46.456 --> 32:49.000
I'm going to try and help
Ken boost his self-esteem

32:49.000 --> 32:50.897
which will make him a
much better inn keeper.

32:50.897 --> 32:53.601
Ken meet Barbie, Barbie meet Ken.

32:53.601 --> 32:54.933
- Pleased to meet you.

32:54.933 --> 32:55.869
- [Ken] Nice to meet you.

32:55.869 --> 32:57.508
- I've flown in Barbie
Hatch, a Hollywood stylist

32:57.508 --> 32:58.687
to give him a new look.

32:58.687 --> 33:00.939
- This one's a little bit too big for you.

33:00.939 --> 33:02.440
A different shirt maybe?

33:02.440 --> 33:05.273
- While Barbie gets to
work on transforming Ken,

33:05.273 --> 33:07.195
I'm gonna check out the inn's website

33:07.195 --> 33:09.541
and see if that's also
in need of a makeover.

33:10.894 --> 33:12.226
This is supposed to be a wifi chair,

33:12.226 --> 33:14.455
I can't even get any signal.

33:20.114 --> 33:20.983
Shit, one bar.

33:22.314 --> 33:23.732
There's amazing competition in this town,

33:23.732 --> 33:27.622
so in order to stand out and
sort of be somewhat different

33:27.622 --> 33:29.158
you do need a great website.

33:30.949 --> 33:32.731
My goodness, the opening
page of the website

33:32.731 --> 33:36.370
looks as old and frumpy as
the interior of the bedrooms,

33:36.370 --> 33:38.508
I mean, so dated.

33:38.508 --> 33:40.822
It's like has been put
together on a $20 budget.

33:40.822 --> 33:41.691
Shocking.

33:42.904 --> 33:45.004
He obviously doesn't realise
that 80% of hotel bookings

33:45.004 --> 33:46.864
are done online today,

33:46.864 --> 33:49.463
so if you've got no
decent website to follow,

33:49.463 --> 33:51.635
then you're absolutely screwed.

33:51.635 --> 33:52.834
Come back to me signal.

33:55.567 --> 33:56.513
- Let's see.

33:56.513 --> 33:57.835
- It's great, really works.

33:57.835 --> 33:59.142
- You don't have to put on a parka,

33:59.142 --> 34:00.010
just goes around your neck, you're done.

34:00.010 --> 34:01.982
- Let's do it, thank you so much.

34:02.855 --> 34:03.723
- You're so welcome.

34:03.723 --> 34:05.701
- Ken's over is finished
and I'm going to take him

34:05.701 --> 34:07.578
out on the town, but first let's see

34:07.578 --> 34:09.426
what his staff think.

34:09.426 --> 34:11.407
(cheering)

34:11.407 --> 34:13.034
Your new innkeeper.

34:14.127 --> 34:15.980
- Very very nice.

34:15.980 --> 34:16.849
- [Gordon] Yeah?

34:16.849 --> 34:17.831
- Yes, very handsome.

34:17.831 --> 34:19.527
- And the scarf?

34:19.527 --> 34:20.484
- Let's go.

34:25.824 --> 34:26.868
I'm taking Ken to a local bar.

34:26.868 --> 34:29.146
I think that meeting the right girl,

34:29.146 --> 34:30.476
will give him a great confidence boost,

34:30.476 --> 34:31.686
the sort of positive energy

34:31.686 --> 34:33.187
that will light up the River Rock

34:33.187 --> 34:35.306
and make Ken a pleasure to deal with.

34:37.694 --> 34:39.436
Quite a lively little place, take a seat.

34:40.643 --> 34:42.436
How dapper does Kenny look?

34:43.418 --> 34:44.793
- [Woman] He looks very dapper.

34:44.793 --> 34:45.846
- [Gordon] He does doesn't he?

34:45.846 --> 34:46.714
- Thank you new (indistinct).

34:48.888 --> 34:50.969
- [Gordon] How can that
man still be single?

34:50.969 --> 34:51.838
- [Woman] Who's single?

34:51.838 --> 34:52.706
- [Gordon] Kenny's single.

34:52.706 --> 34:53.697
- [Woman] No.

34:53.697 --> 34:54.871
We gotta find you a MILF.

34:54.871 --> 34:56.523
We do know someone.

34:58.713 --> 35:00.693
- [Woman] We really do.

35:00.693 --> 35:01.561
- Invite her for dinner tomorrow,

35:01.561 --> 35:03.665
Over at Rock Inn, yes tomorrow night.

35:03.665 --> 35:04.533
- Okay, yes.

35:04.533 --> 35:05.794
- We launch it tomorrow, yeah.

35:05.794 --> 35:07.639
(chattering)

35:07.639 --> 35:08.508
It's gonna be awesome.

35:08.508 --> 35:10.422
- So can we have a little toast to Kenny

35:10.422 --> 35:11.736
finding a girlfriend.

35:11.736 --> 35:12.623
Milford to Kenny.

35:13.675 --> 35:14.593
Come on girlfriend.

35:14.593 --> 35:16.355
- It was really great ego boost,

35:16.355 --> 35:18.934
I felt like the king,
boy he really set me up.

35:20.164 --> 35:21.277
- You look spiffy.

35:21.277 --> 35:22.735
- Thank you very much.

35:22.735 --> 35:24.507
If I fail now, I'm really a loser.

35:25.438 --> 35:26.307
(laughing)

35:26.307 --> 35:27.964
- Big day tomorrow.

35:27.964 --> 35:28.978
- See you tomorrow.

35:28.978 --> 35:30.375
- See you in the morning, best wishes,

35:30.375 --> 35:31.745
good night thank you.

35:31.745 --> 35:32.701
Good night.

35:34.686 --> 35:37.940
Honestly, I've never seen
a man change so much,

35:37.940 --> 35:39.809
let's just hope he's not late
for breakfast in the morning.

35:39.809 --> 35:41.756
- [Woman] Cheers to Kenny.

35:41.756 --> 35:42.624
- [Kenny] (indistinct) ladies.

35:48.888 --> 35:50.494
- [Gordon] My design team
worked through the night

35:50.494 --> 35:53.810
to transform Milford
Pennsylvania's River Rock Inn

35:53.810 --> 35:57.097
and now it's time to reveal the
changes to Ken and his team.

35:58.137 --> 35:59.149
- Good morning.

35:59.149 --> 36:00.133
- Good morning.

36:00.133 --> 36:01.001
- How are we?
- Hi.

36:01.001 --> 36:01.870
- Good.

36:01.870 --> 36:02.898
- Seth, how are you feeling?

36:02.898 --> 36:03.824
- Great, great.

36:03.824 --> 36:05.280
- Excellent, all of you this week,

36:05.280 --> 36:07.782
have really put so much
effort in to get this in

36:07.782 --> 36:09.283
back on track so,

36:09.283 --> 36:11.984
I'm greatly appreciative for your efforts.

36:11.984 --> 36:14.097
It's only fitting, okay,

36:14.097 --> 36:16.770
that we start the relaunch
with a proper sign.

36:16.770 --> 36:21.944
Take a look at this.

36:21.944 --> 36:24.614
It's not the old sign
from the old restaurant,

36:25.946 --> 36:27.114
it's a beautiful sign,

36:27.114 --> 36:28.991
River Rock Inn and Restaurant,

36:28.991 --> 36:31.368
the best food and lodging in the Poconos.

36:31.368 --> 36:33.053
How cool is that?

36:33.053 --> 36:33.991
- It's very cool.

36:33.991 --> 36:34.983
- [Gordon] Isn't it nice?

36:34.983 --> 36:35.904
- Beautiful, it's wonderful thank you.

36:35.904 --> 36:38.417
- Okay, ready to go inside, yeah?

36:38.417 --> 36:40.061
- Excited.

36:40.061 --> 36:41.149
- Let's go.

36:41.149 --> 36:42.185
Come through.

36:42.185 --> 36:43.536
Are you ready?

36:43.536 --> 36:46.042
It's a beautiful place to live and stay,

36:46.042 --> 36:47.398
not a place you got to come and die.

36:48.646 --> 36:51.325
First off, we have a
stunning colour on the walls,

36:51.325 --> 36:52.733
gone is that hideous paper.

36:53.829 --> 36:55.340
So now it's in keeping with a rustic charm

36:55.340 --> 36:57.258
and all the bugs are gone too.

36:57.258 --> 36:58.447
- The changes are just incredible,

36:58.447 --> 37:00.032
I'm a bit overwhelmed by them.

37:00.032 --> 37:02.263
I'm blown away, totally blown away.

37:02.263 --> 37:06.121
- We replaced that dinosaur
TV with a new flat screen.

37:06.121 --> 37:07.596
Guess what?

37:07.596 --> 37:11.147
It works okay, replacing the mattresses.

37:11.147 --> 37:12.162
Stunning linen.

37:13.207 --> 37:14.515
- [Woman] Oh my goodness.

37:14.515 --> 37:15.384
- New table lamps.

37:15.384 --> 37:16.350
And guess what?

37:16.350 --> 37:18.866
Gone are the spunk stains.

37:20.214 --> 37:24.184
Karen the only Milky Way
from the skies above, yes?

37:26.214 --> 37:28.218
Karen, what'd you think?

37:28.218 --> 37:29.754
- I think it's absolutely beautiful.

37:29.754 --> 37:31.845
It's still a country inn,
but it's a country inn

37:31.845 --> 37:33.026
of the year 2012.

37:34.045 --> 37:36.228
- Let me show you the
room next door, please.

37:37.100 --> 37:38.271
- This is incredible.

37:39.238 --> 37:41.545
This is just amazing.

37:41.545 --> 37:42.971
Gordon just did wonders here.

37:42.971 --> 37:43.902
- Oh, by the way.

37:44.900 --> 37:45.768
- [Ken] What?

37:45.768 --> 37:48.605
- I've updated your router,
okay so you have wifi.

37:49.644 --> 37:50.994
- [Karen] In the room?

37:50.994 --> 37:52.026
- Inside the room.

37:52.026 --> 37:53.152
- Oh my God.

37:53.152 --> 37:54.464
- [Gordon] How cool is that?

37:54.464 --> 37:56.485
Amazing, I know.

37:56.485 --> 37:57.354
- I'm blown away.

37:57.354 --> 37:58.223
- You're blown away?

37:58.223 --> 37:59.091
- Just blown away.

37:59.091 --> 37:59.960
- Excellent.

37:59.960 --> 38:01.184
- Oh, wow.

38:01.184 --> 38:02.535
- Please come in.

38:02.535 --> 38:04.166
- Wow, look at this.

38:04.166 --> 38:05.035
- [Gordon] Come in, come in, come in.

38:06.062 --> 38:07.552
- Holy mackerel.

38:07.552 --> 38:08.420
- [Gordon] When I first arrived,

38:08.420 --> 38:10.019
the check-in was so confusing.

38:10.019 --> 38:13.793
Now the guests come in, they sit down,

38:13.793 --> 38:16.629
we offer them a coffee, glass of water

38:16.629 --> 38:21.596
and then we'll go to actually
booking them in online.

38:22.871 --> 38:25.920
(laughing)

38:25.920 --> 38:26.806
How cool is that?

38:28.767 --> 38:30.810
Now, how much do you
spend a linen a month?

38:30.810 --> 38:32.525
- A fortune.

38:32.525 --> 38:35.018
- A fortune, underneath tablecloths,

38:35.018 --> 38:36.159
you had these stunning natural tables,

38:36.159 --> 38:39.371
which were just being hidden
at a ridiculous expense.

38:39.371 --> 38:41.509
Focus on the linen upstairs in the rooms.

38:43.360 --> 38:45.377
- Before Gordon was here,
I just had a restaurant,

38:45.377 --> 38:48.380
now I have an inn, I have a destination.

38:48.380 --> 38:51.734
I can't wait, I'm looking
forward to the relaunch tonight.

38:51.734 --> 38:52.603
We're going to have a lot of fun.

38:52.603 --> 38:54.065
- You like it?

38:54.065 --> 38:55.108
- Thank you.
- Yeah?

38:55.108 --> 38:56.023
You like it?

38:56.023 --> 38:56.892
Good man.

39:00.118 --> 39:00.986
With the new decor,

39:00.986 --> 39:02.363
and Ramesh's expert training.

39:02.363 --> 39:04.844
- Hello welcome to the River Rock,

39:04.844 --> 39:06.594
I'm Karen.

39:06.594 --> 39:07.597
- [Gordon] Along with
a newly inspired Ken.

39:07.597 --> 39:09.952
- Nice to see you, how you been?

39:09.952 --> 39:11.041
Enjoy your dinner.

39:11.041 --> 39:12.108
- Thank you.

39:12.108 --> 39:13.387
- [Gordon] The River Rock
is in a much better place.

39:14.451 --> 39:17.305
Time to go, when I got here Ken, honestly,

39:17.305 --> 39:18.983
a hopeless innkeeper.

39:18.983 --> 39:20.485
Almost like someone had given up,

39:20.485 --> 39:22.813
but we've turned him around.

39:23.913 --> 39:26.095
It's almost like he's sort
of, he's got his mojo back

39:27.081 --> 39:29.838
and now River Rock has
every chance of succeeding.

39:29.838 --> 39:32.716
I tell you what, I've seen a lot of skies,

39:32.716 --> 39:35.604
but not quite a Milky Way like that.

39:35.604 --> 39:36.473
Fuck me.

39:37.447 --> 39:40.515
As I prepare to leave, guests
are arriving for the relaunch

39:40.515 --> 39:44.254
and I noticed some familiar
faces from the bar last night

39:44.254 --> 39:45.260
and as promised they've brought a friend.

39:45.260 --> 39:46.953
- How are you my darling?

39:46.953 --> 39:48.498
- Nice to meet you.

39:48.498 --> 39:49.367
- She's going to meet Kenny tonight.

39:49.367 --> 39:51.971
- Oh you're the date.

39:51.971 --> 39:54.598
He's around, have a
peek, have a little peek.

39:54.598 --> 39:55.467
First impressions?

39:55.467 --> 39:56.975
- He looks cute.

39:56.975 --> 39:57.887
- Looks cute.

39:57.887 --> 39:58.756
Nice.

40:00.171 --> 40:02.531
I can feel a good night coming on.

40:02.531 --> 40:04.845
(women laughing)

40:04.845 --> 40:06.385
(dramatic music)

40:06.385 --> 40:08.846
- Joey I need three onion
soups, three fish cakes

40:08.846 --> 40:10.555
and fish fingers.

40:10.555 --> 40:11.759
- [Gordon] With Ken trusting his staff

40:11.759 --> 40:13.544
and not micromanaging, he's able to spend

40:13.544 --> 40:14.763
more time on the floor.

40:14.763 --> 40:15.632
- Salute my friends.

40:15.632 --> 40:18.566
- [Gordon] Leaving time to
charm the Milson Milford.

40:18.566 --> 40:19.669
- Hello, how's everyone tonight?

40:19.669 --> 40:21.300
Welcome.

40:21.300 --> 40:22.536
- And this is..

40:22.536 --> 40:25.369
- Hi Kenny, very nice to meet you.

40:25.369 --> 40:27.975
- Nice to meet you, follow me.

40:29.136 --> 40:31.066
- Come on wake up.

40:31.066 --> 40:34.476
- I was excited to see
them, she was very pretty.

40:34.476 --> 40:36.811
I look forward to talking with her.

40:36.811 --> 40:37.990
There we go ladies.

40:37.990 --> 40:39.711
- [Woman] Why thank you so much.

40:39.711 --> 40:41.007
- [Ken] Salute.

40:41.007 --> 40:43.096
- My first impressions
of Ken, he looks cute,

40:43.096 --> 40:44.138
very gentlemen like.

40:45.342 --> 40:46.893
See how the night goes.

40:46.893 --> 40:48.514
- Salute ladies, thank you very much.

40:52.160 --> 40:54.746
- The inn is buzzing and
Ken has invited some very

40:54.746 --> 40:57.144
special guests to see
the place at it's best.

40:57.144 --> 40:58.249
- And this is my brother.

40:58.249 --> 41:00.197
- Oh, how are you sir?

41:00.197 --> 41:01.252
- Pleased to meet you.

41:01.252 --> 41:02.121
- Likewise.

41:02.121 --> 41:02.990
Good to see you too.

41:02.990 --> 41:03.858
- And my mother.

41:03.858 --> 41:05.069
- Hello madame, how are you?

41:05.069 --> 41:05.937
- Hi, how are you?

41:05.937 --> 41:06.806
- Very well, thank you, nice to meet you.

41:06.806 --> 41:08.802
- There's no words to express,
how proud I am of Kenneth.

41:08.802 --> 41:10.418
- Upstairs, the guests are loving

41:10.418 --> 41:12.347
the new rooms and downstairs,

41:12.347 --> 41:14.797
they're loving the fresh
local menu that chef Seth

41:14.797 --> 41:16.776
and I put together.

41:16.776 --> 41:17.645
- Really really good.

41:17.645 --> 41:19.084
- Delicious.

41:19.084 --> 41:19.952
- It's really good.

41:22.044 --> 41:23.973
- Before I can leave,
there's one last thing

41:23.973 --> 41:25.751
I need to take care of.

41:25.751 --> 41:27.549
Can I have your cellular please?

41:27.549 --> 41:29.065
No not for me, for Ken come on.

41:32.096 --> 41:34.358
Amazing, hey listen thanks
so much for coming tonight.

41:34.358 --> 41:36.037
I really appreciate it.

41:36.037 --> 41:37.372
- [Woman] Thank you for asking.

41:37.372 --> 41:40.166
- Ken come here, now how are you feeling?

41:40.166 --> 41:41.365
- I feel wonderful.

41:41.365 --> 41:43.263
- When I saw you at the
beginning at the week

41:43.263 --> 41:44.191
I thought you were going to sort of almost

41:45.962 --> 41:47.159
I suppose fall to the wayside,

41:47.159 --> 41:48.185
but you bounced back and
I'm grateful for that.

41:48.185 --> 41:49.415
- Thank you, I'm grateful for you.

41:49.415 --> 41:50.719
- Oh, and one more thing.

41:53.199 --> 41:54.869
(Ken laughing)

41:54.869 --> 41:56.777
- Kim's cell number, it's for you.

41:57.949 --> 41:59.962
- You can't have a better
wing man than Gordon Ramsey,

41:59.962 --> 42:02.113
holy shit, he gave me her number,

42:02.113 --> 42:03.005
it's in my pocket.

42:08.526 --> 42:10.248
- No more sticky notes,
nothing, let them do it.

42:10.248 --> 42:11.823
- I will.
- Yeah?

42:11.823 --> 42:12.692
Okay.

42:14.117 --> 42:16.755
- Love you, I think you're the
greatest, thank you so much.

42:16.755 --> 42:19.289
Gordon made me realise that
I should be less of the

42:19.289 --> 42:22.584
hands-on owner who can't see
the forest through the trees,

42:22.584 --> 42:25.191
from here on I'm empowering my staff

42:25.191 --> 42:26.650
to make their own decisions

42:27.758 --> 42:28.955
and I'm going to support them,

42:28.955 --> 42:30.908
no more micromanaging for me.

42:32.562 --> 42:33.668
- What a week.

42:33.668 --> 42:34.724
What a galaxy.

42:35.680 --> 42:36.549
Fuck me.
