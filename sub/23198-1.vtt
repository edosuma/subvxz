01:54.060 --> 01:56.620
Has Maj. Trevor called in
from the field yet?

01:56.696 --> 01:58.323
No, sir. Not yet.

01:58.398 --> 02:01.265
But the maneuver exercise
should be completed soon.

02:01.635 --> 02:03.694
Is something wrong, Gen. Blankenship?

02:03.770 --> 02:06.466
Something could be very wrong,
and frankly I’m worried.

02:06.540 --> 02:08.701
Steve may be in danger
and not even know it.

02:08.775 --> 02:10.470
Danger? I don't understand.

02:10.544 --> 02:13.843
The FBI has proof
that the top Nazi spy ring, the Abwehr...

02:13.914 --> 02:15.779
is definitely active again in Washington.

02:15.849 --> 02:19.341
I thought their activity had stopped
since Steve captured their leader...

02:19.419 --> 02:21.683
the Baroness Von Gunther,
and put her in prison.

02:21.755 --> 02:24.883
That's why I’m worried.
The FBI's gonna fill me in later.

02:24.958 --> 02:28.655
But if those people have reorganized,
then Steve could be in great danger.

02:28.728 --> 02:31.288
Tell Steve I want to see him
the minute he gets back.

02:31.364 --> 02:34.094
Yes, sir. I’ll get word to him right now.

03:32.325 --> 03:34.225
This inactivity is maddening.

03:34.461 --> 03:37.089
We should receive word soon,
Baroness Von Gunther.

03:37.163 --> 03:39.256
Another walk around the compound?

03:39.566 --> 03:40.760
I suppose so.

03:41.234 --> 03:42.929
What time is it, Hansen?

03:43.270 --> 03:45.363
It's almost 1600, Baroness.

03:46.306 --> 03:48.706
The truck's due here at 1600 hours.

03:49.109 --> 03:50.770
Our objective is to capture it.

03:50.844 --> 03:53.677
Remember, the assumption is
we're in enemy territory.

03:53.747 --> 03:56.113
So when the truck stops, move in fast.

03:56.182 --> 03:58.514
Nobody fires unless absolutely necessary.

03:58.585 --> 04:01.452
Any questions?
Okay, let's take our positions.

04:41.895 --> 04:45.353
Shore up those front wheels.
I’m gonna try and save this truck.

05:10.757 --> 05:13.351
Wonder Woman! Am I glad to see you.

05:19.799 --> 05:20.959
Thanks.

05:24.471 --> 05:26.336
What went wrong, Major?

05:26.573 --> 05:30.509
I don't know precisely.
But I just can't believe it was an accident.

05:35.248 --> 05:38.649
I was ordered to use that truck
as the object of our training maneuver.

05:38.718 --> 05:40.549
How could it possibly
be carrying weapons?

05:40.620 --> 05:43.054
Not just weapons. A top-secret shipment.

05:43.123 --> 05:45.614
New rapid-fire rifles
for our troops overseas.

05:45.692 --> 05:49.025
They were supposed to be going
to the Fort Myer arsenal for dispersal.

05:49.095 --> 05:51.188
The wrong truck
was assigned to me deliberately.

05:51.264 --> 05:54.131
Somebody tampered with the axle pin
while it was being loaded.

05:54.200 --> 05:56.930
Somebody who knew what was in it
and where it was going.

05:57.003 --> 05:58.834
In other words, sabotage.

05:58.905 --> 06:01.465
Brilliantly planned
and executed from the inside.

06:01.541 --> 06:03.805
Perhaps from right here
in the War Department.

06:03.877 --> 06:07.108
Unfortunately, Steve,
the FBI believes the same thing.

06:07.247 --> 06:11.581
- And it has information implicating you.
- Me? A spy?

06:12.819 --> 06:14.616
Somebody's got to be kidding.

06:14.688 --> 06:16.747
It’s hardly a kidding matter, Steve.

06:16.823 --> 06:19.348
Discrediting a famous war hero like you...

06:19.426 --> 06:22.395
could deal a serious blow
to the morale of the entire country.

06:22.462 --> 06:25.454
But what proof do they have
to support such an accusation?

06:25.532 --> 06:27.864
Enough for the Senate
to call a secret hearing.

06:27.934 --> 06:31.028
Arthur Deal the third is heading
the committee to investigate you.

06:31.104 --> 06:33.197
The Arthur Deal? The big steel magnate?

06:33.273 --> 06:37.039
He was handpicked by the President
because of his reputation as a patriot.

06:37.110 --> 06:40.204
What about my reputation?
Doesn't that count for something?

06:40.280 --> 06:43.443
Unfortunately, Steve,
the evidence against you is serious.

06:43.516 --> 06:46.883
Three other important weapon shipments
have been sabotaged recently.

06:46.953 --> 06:49.615
The FBI has established that in each case...

06:49.689 --> 06:52.089
you were on the scene, or nearby.

06:52.525 --> 06:55.961
I was always on military business,
under top-secret orders.

06:56.029 --> 07:00.261
Yes, and Arthur Deal has requested
copies of all those secret orders.

07:00.734 --> 07:02.861
I’ve asked Diana to pull that file.

07:06.539 --> 07:09.804
There's no trace of those top-secret orders
anywhere.

07:09.876 --> 07:11.605
But they have to be here.

07:12.145 --> 07:15.273
I know I filed them.
But I can't even find the folder.

07:19.452 --> 07:23.513
- Maj. Trevor's office. May I help you?
- Put the Major on at once.

07:24.657 --> 07:27.023
Someone wants to speak to you urgently.

07:28.661 --> 07:30.151
Maj. Trevor speaking.

07:30.230 --> 07:33.324
I’ve got some valuable information
for you, Major.

07:33.566 --> 07:37.002
About that army weapons truck
that was sabotaged yesterday.

07:37.070 --> 07:38.162
What about it?

07:38.238 --> 07:40.706
The axle bolt was unscrewed.

07:40.840 --> 07:41.864
Who is this?

07:41.941 --> 07:45.877
If you want information about who
sabotaged the other three shipments...

07:46.212 --> 07:49.807
come to the Old Virginia Stables
on the Fort Myer road.

07:50.150 --> 07:53.950
- How do I know you're on the level?
- How about if I give you back the copies...

07:54.020 --> 07:56.784
of those top-secret orders
you're searching for?

07:57.257 --> 08:00.283
The stables in an hour, Major.
And come alone.

08:00.660 --> 08:02.025
I’ll be waiting.

08:12.705 --> 08:16.004
- Anyone important?
- Yes, I think so. An informant.

08:16.075 --> 08:19.476
Claims he knows something important
about the sabotaged weapon shipment.

08:19.546 --> 08:21.571
And he has the missing orders.

08:21.981 --> 08:25.109
He wants me to meet him
at the Old Virginia Stable near Fort Myer.

08:25.185 --> 08:28.621
No. It’s too dangerous.
It could be a trap or an ambush.

08:28.855 --> 08:30.516
Either way, it's dangerous.

08:30.590 --> 08:32.284
War is dangerous, Diana.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.455
This man is my only chance.

08:35.528 --> 08:37.996
He may offer a link to the sabotage ring.

08:38.431 --> 08:40.592
Steve, be careful.

08:41.668 --> 08:42.965
I will.

09:00.453 --> 09:02.353
- Yeoman Prince.
- Yes, General?

09:02.856 --> 09:05.450
Have you been able to find the files
for Maj. Trevor?

09:05.525 --> 09:08.688
No, sir. I’ve looked everywhere.
They're gone.

09:08.761 --> 09:12.288
Maj. Trevor seems to think
that they may have been stolen.

09:12.365 --> 09:15.823
Keep looking. Without those orders,
Steve has no proof of his innocence.

09:15.902 --> 09:17.836
- You must find them.
- Yes, sir.

09:56.175 --> 09:57.642
Anybody here?

10:51.931 --> 10:53.956
Police headquarters. Sgt. Stransky.

10:54.033 --> 10:58.470
I have a hot tip for you, Sergeant.
It concerns Maj. Steve Trevor.

10:59.105 --> 11:00.129
Who is this?

11:00.206 --> 11:04.006
You'll find him at the Old Virginia Stables
on the Fort Myer road.

11:04.577 --> 11:07.671
He just set fire
to its stockpile of ammunition.

11:31.304 --> 11:33.534
Steve, wake up.

12:51.317 --> 12:55.777
You're all right, Steve. Just lie still.
It’s me, Diana.

12:56.489 --> 12:59.947
- You're in my apartment.
- Apartment?

13:02.862 --> 13:04.022
Diana!

13:04.797 --> 13:07.288
What happened? How did I get here?
Oh, boy!

13:07.733 --> 13:09.428
Something really hit me.

13:09.669 --> 13:13.127
All I know is that my bell rang
about 15 minutes ago.

13:13.606 --> 13:16.666
And I opened the door
and found you lying outside.

13:16.943 --> 13:18.240
With this note.

13:20.179 --> 13:21.510
It’s from Wonder Woman.

13:21.581 --> 13:25.415
Yes. She believes that you were a victim
of the Nazi sabotage ring.

13:28.221 --> 13:30.849
After all that's happened,
I’m sure she's right.

13:30.923 --> 13:33.153
The ring has been reorganized.

13:34.460 --> 13:38.157
What if you question the former leader,
that Baroness in prison?

13:38.464 --> 13:40.455
She might know something.

13:40.800 --> 13:43.291
That's exactly
what I intended to do, Diana.

13:43.503 --> 13:45.266
It may be just a coincidence...

13:45.338 --> 13:49.138
but all the sabotage attempts
have taken place in the area of Fort Myer.

13:50.209 --> 13:52.609
That's where the Baroness is imprisoned.

13:52.712 --> 13:55.340
I suggest we pay the Baroness a visit.

13:57.884 --> 14:01.445
The Baroness is a model prisoner.
Quiet, refined, agreeable.

14:01.621 --> 14:04.488
It’s hard to believe
she's a dangerous enemy alien.

14:04.624 --> 14:08.355
I hope you're keeping her well guarded,
warden, in spite of her refinement.

14:08.427 --> 14:11.191
Of course. I run a very taut ship here.

14:11.264 --> 14:14.199
Nothing is allowed
to disturb prison routine.

14:14.333 --> 14:16.893
Hey! What's the idea?
Look what you made me do.

14:16.969 --> 14:18.937
You got no business playing out here.

14:19.005 --> 14:20.097
Excuse me.

14:20.506 --> 14:22.167
What's the trouble, Hansen?

14:22.241 --> 14:25.233
No trouble. Just trying to keep the boy
from disturbing you.

14:25.311 --> 14:26.869
He was fooling with the door.

14:26.946 --> 14:29.346
I was not. I was taking fingerprints.

14:29.415 --> 14:31.212
Now my whole kit's wrecked.

14:32.451 --> 14:33.918
You did it on purpose.

14:33.986 --> 14:37.387
Like Dr. Moriarty did to Sherlock Holmes
in the case of-

14:37.456 --> 14:39.481
Tommy! That'll be enough.

14:42.161 --> 14:45.324
- All right, Hansen, go back to your duties.
- Yes, warden.

14:46.032 --> 14:49.331
I told you to stop spending all day
playing detective.

14:49.435 --> 14:51.300
I will, Father. Honest.

14:51.370 --> 14:54.396
But first I have to solve
the mystery of the secret tunnel.

14:54.473 --> 14:58.739
Tommy, no more of this Sherlock Holmes
nonsense. You understand?

14:58.945 --> 15:03.075
Now, run outside and play.
It’s a fine afternoon. Come on.

15:04.050 --> 15:05.984
Off you go. Attaboy.

15:11.424 --> 15:13.153
My son lives in a fantasy world.

15:13.226 --> 15:16.718
Secret passages,
men flying spaceships to the moon.

15:17.396 --> 15:21.196
I wish he had more children to play with
so he wouldn't read so much.

15:21.267 --> 15:23.861
Our time is limited, warden.
May we see the Baroness now?

15:23.936 --> 15:26.769
I’d like Diana to meet her.
She's very intuitive about people.

15:26.839 --> 15:28.033
Of course, Major.

15:28.107 --> 15:31.167
Forgive me for taking up your time
with my problems...

15:31.244 --> 15:33.769
but raising a child
is very difficult for a widower.

15:33.846 --> 15:36.041
Especially living in a prison.

15:36.115 --> 15:37.173
Thank you.

17:30.730 --> 17:32.527
You have visitors, Baroness.

17:45.711 --> 17:47.201
Hello, Baroness Von Gunther.

17:47.279 --> 17:49.770
- Maj. Trevor. What a pleasant surprise.
- Thank you.

17:49.849 --> 17:51.714
This is my secretary, Yeoman Prince.

17:51.784 --> 17:53.376
- How do you do?
- Hello.

17:53.919 --> 17:55.216
What is it?

17:55.688 --> 17:59.249
Just a little dizzy spell.
I’ve been feeling rather ill lately.

17:59.492 --> 18:00.823
You do look pale.

18:00.893 --> 18:03.453
Maybe you'll feel better
if you sit down, Baroness.

18:03.529 --> 18:05.292
Yes, please. Let me help you.

18:05.364 --> 18:07.093
Thank you. You're so kind.

18:07.433 --> 18:09.765
I suppose you're wondering why I’m here.

18:09.835 --> 18:13.293
I’m just grateful to have
such a distinguished visitor.

18:14.373 --> 18:16.364
Why did you come to see me?

18:16.442 --> 18:19.240
I need some information.
I think you can give it to me.

18:19.311 --> 18:22.576
That is, if you feel well enough
to answer a few questions.

18:23.015 --> 18:25.245
What do the questions concern?

18:26.819 --> 18:30.084
The Abwehr. It’s been very active
in this area lately.

18:30.356 --> 18:33.883
The Abwehr spy organization
doesn't interest me anymore.

18:34.226 --> 18:36.558
And neither does the Nazi cause.

18:37.329 --> 18:39.160
I find that hard to believe.

18:39.231 --> 18:42.029
I suppose it is. People change in prison.

18:42.968 --> 18:45.061
The loneliness, the isolation.

18:46.238 --> 18:48.900
I’ve done a lot of thinking
behind these walls, Major.

18:48.974 --> 18:50.771
And a lot of reading.

18:53.646 --> 18:55.546
'"The Principles of Democracy. '"

18:55.614 --> 18:59.607
Well, I’m proud of you.
It takes a lot of guts to admit that...

19:03.322 --> 19:04.687
That you've been wrong.

19:05.691 --> 19:09.422
That's an interesting pendant
you're wearing. Was that made in Austria?

19:09.495 --> 19:11.224
This? I don't know.

19:11.997 --> 19:15.364
It’s an heirloom. One of the few
personal possessions I have left.

19:15.434 --> 19:17.698
The warden was kind enough
to let me keep it.

19:17.770 --> 19:19.237
May I see it?

19:19.572 --> 19:20.903
Of course.

19:22.475 --> 19:23.601
Thank you.

19:23.676 --> 19:24.700
- Steve.
- Yes?

19:24.777 --> 19:27.177
I forgot my stenographic notebook
in the car.

19:27.246 --> 19:29.612
Can you spare me for a minute
while I get it?

19:29.682 --> 19:31.877
- By all means.
- Thank you. Excuse me.

19:38.524 --> 19:42.119
It’s not like Diana to forget things.
She's usually very efficient.

19:42.194 --> 19:45.527
Really? She seems
so plain and uninteresting.

19:45.831 --> 19:48.561
Her coloring's rather like wet Bisquick.

19:49.068 --> 19:51.969
I’m sure she's blind as a bat
without those glasses.

19:52.938 --> 19:56.897
Yeoman Prince is very hardworking
and totally loyal.

20:00.579 --> 20:03.673
Too bad you don't know the history
of this. Might be fascinating.

20:03.749 --> 20:05.478
Really? What makes you think so?

20:05.551 --> 20:09.715
I saw metal castings like this when
I was traveling in Europe before the war.

20:09.922 --> 20:11.389
Exactly like that?

20:11.857 --> 20:13.085
Or very close.

20:13.158 --> 20:17.561
They were keys, a medieval variety,
invented by Austrian metal craftsmen.

20:18.531 --> 20:20.863
Isn't that a fascinating coincidence?

20:20.933 --> 20:23.731
About the Abwehr.
What was it you wanted to know?

20:28.474 --> 20:32.035
Whatever you can tell me,
about their sabotage methods, techniques.

21:04.510 --> 21:05.602
Help!

21:08.080 --> 21:11.846
- Wonder Woman!
- Hold on, Tommy!

21:18.991 --> 21:21.289
Steady now. We'll be down in a minute.

21:30.603 --> 21:34.539
Put your arms around my neck.
And hold tight.

21:53.325 --> 21:56.351
- Are you all right?
- Sure. Thanks to you, Wonder Woman.

21:56.428 --> 22:00.694
- Why did you climb up the ladder?
- I was trying to get up to the tower.

22:01.934 --> 22:05.495
I saw somebody up there last night
flashing signals with a light.

22:05.671 --> 22:07.263
Did you see who it was?

22:07.339 --> 22:11.002
No, but I thought maybe
I could get his fingerprints and find out.

22:11.310 --> 22:13.073
But I forgot my kit.

22:15.280 --> 22:18.943
...and in 1933,
the Abwehr used propaganda methods.

22:19.018 --> 22:22.078
- Articles, editorials-
- Yes, we know all that.

22:22.154 --> 22:25.055
I need further information
about their present activities.

22:25.124 --> 22:28.116
Key names, base of operations,
the long-range targets.

22:28.360 --> 22:30.089
That's all I know, Major.

22:30.262 --> 22:33.663
I told you, I’ve blocked the Abwehr
out of my mind completely.

22:34.867 --> 22:36.357
Excuse the interruption...

22:36.435 --> 22:39.461
but it is almost time
for the prisoners' daily exercise drill.

22:39.538 --> 22:42.006
Of course, if you're not through
with the questioning-

22:42.074 --> 22:43.803
No. It’s quite all right.

22:45.377 --> 22:46.969
Where's Yeoman Prince?

22:47.346 --> 22:49.906
She went outside
to get something from the car.

22:49.982 --> 22:51.813
I wonder what's keeping her.

22:52.051 --> 22:55.612
Oh, well, we're finished here.
We'll run into her on the way out.

22:57.089 --> 22:58.522
- Baroness.
- Major.

23:12.805 --> 23:14.500
Is your lasso really magic?

23:14.573 --> 23:17.098
Yes, it has a certain great power.

23:17.609 --> 23:20.976
It forces people to speak only the truth
when they're bound with it.

23:21.046 --> 23:24.482
Wow! I wish I had one.
That'd be perfect for detective work.

23:29.154 --> 23:31.520
I haven't got time
to get my lasso now, Tommy.

23:31.590 --> 23:34.582
Will you pry it loose and take care of it
till I come back?

23:34.660 --> 23:35.854
It'll be our secret.

23:35.928 --> 23:37.395
Sure, Wonder Woman.

23:38.063 --> 23:39.394
Thank you.

23:56.014 --> 23:57.914
- Steve.
- There you are.

23:57.983 --> 24:01.009
I’m really sorry. I couldn't find
my way back to the cell block.

24:01.086 --> 24:03.577
You shouldn't have been
wandering around here alone.

24:03.655 --> 24:04.952
At least you're safe.

24:05.023 --> 24:07.287
Yes. But I couldn't even take notes for you.

24:07.359 --> 24:09.793
There was nothing to take.
She wasn't much help.

24:09.862 --> 24:12.194
She told me very little
I didn't already know.

24:12.264 --> 24:15.256
Frankly, Steve, she doesn't seem
to be completely sincere.

24:15.334 --> 24:17.564
I just don't think
she's a very trustworthy woman.

24:17.636 --> 24:21.128
I’m sure you're right.
She knows a lot more than she'll admit.

24:28.781 --> 24:29.975
Hansen!

24:32.718 --> 24:34.345
Coming, Baroness.

24:39.725 --> 24:43.388
I want you to get a message to Thor.
Tell him I must see him tonight.

24:43.462 --> 24:47.330
Now that Maj. Trevor is suspicious,
we'll have to discuss a change in plans.

24:47.399 --> 24:48.661
Yes, Baroness.

24:49.635 --> 24:52.195
But I have lost my key for the tunnel door.

24:52.471 --> 24:54.598
Take mine for now. Hurry.

25:37.416 --> 25:38.940
Signal lights.

26:15.020 --> 26:16.988
Hooded cloak.

26:46.084 --> 26:48.985
- Stay here and keep your eyes open.
- Yes, Baroness.

26:54.593 --> 26:57.255
- Good evening, Thor.
- Good evening, Baroness.

26:57.663 --> 26:59.688
I was surprised to get your message.

26:59.765 --> 27:03.496
It’s unwise to contact me so soon
after a sabotage incident.

27:03.635 --> 27:06.160
It was unavoidable.
Something urgent has come up.

27:06.238 --> 27:09.401
It concerns Steve Trevor.
He came to visit me today.

27:09.675 --> 27:11.006
What did he want?

27:11.076 --> 27:14.375
Information about Nazi spy activities
near the Fort.

27:14.446 --> 27:16.641
He feels they've increased recently.

27:17.549 --> 27:19.141
That is disturbing.

27:19.484 --> 27:22.351
Do you suppose he suspects you
of being connected with them?

27:22.421 --> 27:25.618
I’m sure of it.
He even recognized this as a key.

27:25.691 --> 27:27.886
Obviously you didn't handle him very well.

27:27.960 --> 27:31.157
Couldn't you divert his suspicions
with your charms?

27:31.229 --> 27:33.220
Or wasn't he susceptible to them?

27:33.298 --> 27:35.289
That has nothing to do with it.

27:35.434 --> 27:39.336
We have spent weeks making
Steve Trevor look like a double agent.

27:39.805 --> 27:41.966
Our operatives
have arranged to place him...

27:42.040 --> 27:44.406
at the scenes of
three different sabotage incidents.

27:44.476 --> 27:48.435
He was even present when the truck
carrying rapid-fire rifles was destroyed.

27:48.513 --> 27:52.244
All copies of his top-secret orders
are in our possession.

27:52.317 --> 27:56.253
And we've leaked incriminating evidence
about him to the FBI.

27:56.321 --> 28:00.621
But all our careful work will be undone
if he discovers the truth.

28:00.826 --> 28:02.157
I’m aware of that.

28:02.227 --> 28:05.628
But everything was running smoothly
until the incident at the stable.

28:05.697 --> 28:07.460
That was your error.

28:07.966 --> 28:09.593
Somebody helped him get away.

28:09.668 --> 28:13.627
At least we agree on that.
And I’m convinced it was Wonder Woman.

28:13.705 --> 28:15.172
Wonder Woman.

28:18.176 --> 28:19.473
What makes you think that?

28:19.544 --> 28:23.412
I saw her talking to the warden's son at
the prison today while Trevor was there.

28:23.482 --> 28:26.815
I’ve heard she pays close attention
to the Major's activities.

28:26.952 --> 28:30.615
This may be serious. It could interfere
with the second phase of our plans...

28:30.689 --> 28:33.021
to sabotage the next big rocket shipment.

28:33.091 --> 28:35.787
Have you found out
when the shipment leaves Fort Myer?

28:35.861 --> 28:39.058
In two days. We can't have Trevor
snooping around. It’s too risky.

28:39.131 --> 28:41.497
Somehow we have to stop him.

28:43.201 --> 28:44.793
Why not capture him?

28:46.204 --> 28:50.538
We can change our plan and make it look
as if he defected to the Nazi cause.

28:51.176 --> 28:55.237
We can even arrange to have him present
when the rocket shipment is destroyed.

28:55.313 --> 28:58.578
Excellent. Then he'll be blamed
for that, too.

28:59.251 --> 29:02.311
It will thoroughly discredit
the American war hero...

29:02.387 --> 29:04.150
even sooner than we planned.

29:04.222 --> 29:06.986
The problem is how to catch him.
It won't be easy.

29:07.059 --> 29:10.256
He'll be doubly cautious
after the incident at the stable.

29:10.328 --> 29:12.091
We won't have to catch him.

29:13.331 --> 29:15.629
He'll come to us. I’ll arrange it.

29:16.034 --> 29:19.060
- There must be no doubt of his guilt.
- There won't be.

29:19.371 --> 29:22.966
Not after we leave his body
at the scene of the sabotage.

29:25.510 --> 29:28.809
Oh, yes. His all-American body.

29:29.781 --> 29:30.770
Splendid.

29:38.824 --> 29:40.451
You wanted to see me, General.

29:40.525 --> 29:42.152
I have bad news, Steve.

29:42.227 --> 29:44.695
Arthur Deal has had
your special hearing moved up.

29:44.763 --> 29:46.355
It’s scheduled for tomorrow.

29:46.431 --> 29:48.626
And unless you can
prove your innocence...

29:48.700 --> 29:51.726
they'll put you under house arrest
to await court-martial.

29:51.803 --> 29:54.772
We can't let that happen, General.
There's too much at stake.

29:54.840 --> 29:56.364
If this sabotage isn't stopped...

29:56.441 --> 29:59.740
every important weapon shipment
in the area could be destroyed.

29:59.811 --> 30:03.907
Deal has offered to meet with you tonight,
listen to what evidence you have.

30:04.216 --> 30:08.550
If you can convince him of your innocence,
he may postpone the hearing.

30:09.187 --> 30:11.246
- It’s worth a try.
- Absolutely.

30:11.523 --> 30:14.321
He's expecting you
at his Arlington estate in an hour.

30:14.392 --> 30:18.488
I’ve done everything I can, Steve.
I’m afraid it's up to you now.

30:20.899 --> 30:23.561
- Good luck.
- Thank you, General.

30:23.735 --> 30:26.363
You're a good boss,
and an even better friend.

30:57.235 --> 31:00.170
- What are you reading, Tommy?
- The Hound of the Baskervilles.

31:00.238 --> 31:03.139
Sherlock Holmes was almost killed
solving that case, wasn't he?

31:03.208 --> 31:05.039
Have you read Sherlock Holmes, too?

31:05.110 --> 31:08.546
I used to before I came here.
He's my favorite detective.

31:08.780 --> 31:11.214
Do you believe in him? I do.

31:12.317 --> 31:15.616
Father says he's just a story,
but I think he was real.

31:15.787 --> 31:19.120
Of course he was.
Why, he's as real as Wonder Woman...

31:19.191 --> 31:21.250
and she's one of my closest friends.

31:21.326 --> 31:23.453
- She is?
- Yes.

31:24.162 --> 31:27.529
As a matter of fact,
I got a message from her this morning.

31:27.732 --> 31:30.098
- It’s a message for you.
- Honest? What is it?

31:30.168 --> 31:33.626
She wants to be sure you're taking
good care of the Golden Lasso.

31:33.705 --> 31:36.105
I am. It’s in a real safe place.

31:36.441 --> 31:39.808
Good. Do you know how to make it work?

31:40.078 --> 31:44.037
When people are tied with it,
they have to tell the truth. It makes them.

31:46.651 --> 31:50.712
Are you sure it's in a safe place?
Maybe you should check on it again.

31:50.789 --> 31:53.485
It’s very valuable.
You can't be too careful.

31:53.758 --> 31:55.453
Okay. I’ll go right now.

31:57.829 --> 32:00.024
- Follow him. Quickly.
- Yes, Baroness.

33:31.222 --> 33:34.419
Thank you for seeing me, Mr. Deal.
I appreciate it very much.

33:34.492 --> 33:36.858
I try to keep an open mind, Major.

33:37.696 --> 33:41.496
Now, how about
these sabotage incidents?

33:43.835 --> 33:46.668
The Abwehr must be responsible for them,
Mr. Deal.

33:46.805 --> 33:50.434
And I’m sure they're planning
a large-scale incident in the near future.

33:50.508 --> 33:52.738
Against what objectives?

33:54.145 --> 33:55.510
I don't know yet.

33:55.613 --> 33:59.606
But I’m convinced Baroness Von Gunther
is the key to the entire operation.

34:00.752 --> 34:03.016
Hasn't she been in prison for months?

34:03.288 --> 34:05.984
Supposedly, yes. A perfect cover.

34:06.157 --> 34:08.751
Cover. What makes you suspect that?

34:09.393 --> 34:11.760
Something she was wearing
when I questioned her.

34:11.830 --> 34:13.263
She called it a pendant.

34:13.331 --> 34:16.697
But I remember now that it's really
an ancient Austrian gate key.

34:16.768 --> 34:20.067
I saw a number of them
in a museum in Europe before the war.

34:20.271 --> 34:24.036
You have a remarkable memory
for details, Major.

34:24.242 --> 34:25.231
Go on.

34:25.543 --> 34:26.976
I’d be willing to bet...

34:27.045 --> 34:30.503
that that key opens a secret door
in the prison wall somewhere.

34:30.648 --> 34:34.414
One that leads outside. And the Baroness
uses it whenever she wants...

34:34.485 --> 34:36.716
with the help of a confederate
on the inside.

34:36.788 --> 34:39.813
Which accounts for the renewal
of Abwehr activity.

34:41.493 --> 34:45.360
How clever of you
to recognize the key, Major darling.

34:46.697 --> 34:48.962
And you're right about the door, too.

34:49.067 --> 34:52.059
It was built years ago
by Austrian immigrants.

34:52.971 --> 34:55.405
And it's an important part of our plan.

34:57.776 --> 34:59.869
A very important part.

35:01.546 --> 35:03.104
Hands up, Major.

35:04.416 --> 35:05.974
This time, Major...

35:06.351 --> 35:10.048
you're in a fix even your friend
Wonder Woman can't undo.

35:26.104 --> 35:30.507
I’m sorry to disturb you so late. I’m trying
to get in touch with Steve Trevor.

35:30.575 --> 35:31.951
Haven't you heard from him?

35:31.976 --> 35:34.102
Not since he left
for his meeting with you.

35:34.179 --> 35:36.670
How odd. He left here several hours ago.

35:36.748 --> 35:39.114
Said he was going
directly back to your office.

35:39.184 --> 35:40.549
That's strange.

35:41.319 --> 35:44.686
Tell me, Mr. Deal, after meeting
with Maj. Trevor, face-to-face...

35:44.756 --> 35:46.246
can you doubt his innocence?

35:46.324 --> 35:50.454
General, after meeting him,
I’m more convinced of his guilt than ever.

35:50.528 --> 35:53.793
I'm sorry to hear that.
I hope after the testimony at the hearing...

35:53.865 --> 35:55.264
you'll change your mind.

35:55.333 --> 35:57.324
I just hope Trevor shows up tomorrow.

35:57.402 --> 36:00.030
Sounds to me as if he realized
he's been discovered...

36:00.104 --> 36:02.004
and has gone AWOL.

36:02.073 --> 36:03.540
Goodnight, General.

36:06.211 --> 36:07.974
What is it, General?

36:08.780 --> 36:12.307
It’s very serious, Diana.
Steve does seem to be missing.

36:12.550 --> 36:15.348
And Arthur Deal is convinced of his guilt.

36:16.054 --> 36:19.251
Steve may be working on that theory
he spoke of to save himself.

36:19.324 --> 36:21.121
But he should have told me.

36:21.926 --> 36:25.157
I’ll wait until midnight,
and then I’ll institute a search.

36:25.497 --> 36:28.364
We've got to find him
before that hearing tomorrow.

37:33.031 --> 37:37.491
"I, Maj. Steve Trevor,
proudly confess that I am a Nazi spy...

37:37.569 --> 37:39.332
"and have been for a long time.

37:39.404 --> 37:41.736
"I personally sabotaged
the weapons shipment...

37:41.806 --> 37:43.797
"to undermine America's war effort.

37:43.875 --> 37:45.672
"Now I am returning to Germany.

37:45.743 --> 37:49.509
"But before leaving, I will destroy
a final, top-priority target...

37:49.581 --> 37:51.742
"for the glory of the Third Reich."

37:52.016 --> 37:54.177
It has a ring to it, don't you think?

37:54.252 --> 37:56.516
All it requires is your signature.

37:57.055 --> 37:58.920
You'll never get me to sign that.

37:58.990 --> 38:02.517
He'll sign. Do you recognize this, Major?

38:06.164 --> 38:09.031
- That's Wonder Woman's Golden Lasso.
- That's right.

38:09.133 --> 38:11.658
And if you ever want
to see her alive again...

38:11.736 --> 38:14.170
you'll sign that letter. Promptly.

38:22.981 --> 38:24.380
Just got a report.

38:24.449 --> 38:27.941
Steve's jeep was found near the river,
abandoned, with a note on the seat.

38:28.019 --> 38:31.250
He's confessed his spying,
and he's defected to the Nazis.

38:31.789 --> 38:34.485
No. Not Steve. It’s a forgery.

38:34.559 --> 38:38.017
The signature's been verified by the FBI.
It’s his handwriting.

38:38.162 --> 38:41.620
J. Edgar Hoover himself has issued orders
to arrest Steve on sight...

38:41.699 --> 38:43.667
and shoot if he tries to escape.

38:43.735 --> 38:45.999
We've got to help him, General!

38:46.337 --> 38:48.134
It’ll take a miracle.

38:48.506 --> 38:52.909
If Wonder Woman is anywhere near,
Steve needs her more than ever before.

38:53.645 --> 38:56.011
If only there were some way
to contact her.

38:56.080 --> 39:00.414
General, Steve gave me some of his
confidential papers for safekeeping.

39:00.485 --> 39:03.113
They might have some information
about contacting her.

39:03.187 --> 39:06.748
- They're in my apartment.
- Get them. Hurry! Take my car.

39:06.924 --> 39:10.621
Thank you, sir, but I’ll manage
as quickly on foot in this blackout.

39:23.007 --> 39:24.474
Hello, Tommy.

39:24.642 --> 39:27.736
Wonder Woman.
Your lasso, the Baroness stole it.

39:28.046 --> 39:29.343
No! When?

39:29.414 --> 39:32.212
Tonight. Then she and Hansen
took it away.

39:33.084 --> 39:35.109
I saw them leave in a car.

39:35.286 --> 39:37.914
- Did you see the license number?
- Sure.

39:39.090 --> 39:42.116
23-605. I wrote it in my casebook.

39:42.593 --> 39:45.289
Don't worry, Tommy,
I’ll get it back from them.

39:45.530 --> 39:47.430
You go to bed now. It’s late.

39:58.409 --> 40:00.001
Department of Motor Vehicles.

40:00.078 --> 40:02.546
This is Gen. Blankenship
at the War Department.

40:02.613 --> 40:06.140
I have an emergency request
which must be carried out immediately.

40:06.217 --> 40:08.811
We'll do our best, General.
What's the request?

40:08.886 --> 40:12.754
Trace and identify license number 23-605.

40:13.024 --> 40:14.753
Just a moment, sir.

40:25.803 --> 40:30.467
That's the license number
of a 1939 Packard, General.

40:30.808 --> 40:33.834
It’s registered to Arthur Deal the third...

40:33.911 --> 40:37.074
Number 8, Estate Drive, Arlington.

41:05.910 --> 41:07.377
Good evening.

41:08.513 --> 41:11.141
We've been expecting you,
Wonder Woman.

41:15.787 --> 41:18.551
Effective, isn't it, Major darling?

41:19.157 --> 41:21.455
It’s a newly developed sleeping gas...

41:21.526 --> 41:24.461
one of the Third Reich's
brilliant accomplishments.

41:26.964 --> 41:30.092
These chains are another brilliant
German accomplishment.

41:30.168 --> 41:32.636
The metal is tempered
with a special process.

41:32.703 --> 41:35.797
It’s unbreakable, even by elephants.

41:38.910 --> 41:41.071
Our plan worked perfectly.

42:02.400 --> 42:04.868
She's escaped, the Baroness.
She's not in her cell!

42:04.936 --> 42:07.234
Escaped? What are you waiting for?
Sound the alarm.

42:07.305 --> 42:10.536
Don't let anyone in or out.
Search every cell. Use every man we have.

42:10.608 --> 42:13.668
The Baroness must be apprehended.
I’ll take charge of one detail.

42:13.744 --> 42:16.008
- Father, I’ve got something very-
- Not now.

42:16.080 --> 42:17.877
A very dangerous prisoner has escaped.

42:17.949 --> 42:21.282
Go to your room and lock the door.
Stay there until I send for you.

42:21.352 --> 42:22.876
But, Father...

42:24.522 --> 42:26.547
I know how the Baroness got out.

42:27.091 --> 42:31.460
She used the secret tunnel
behind the old crates. You just...

42:32.597 --> 42:36.829
So... you've been spying
on the Baroness, eh?

42:37.802 --> 42:40.930
Hansen. No. Honest.

42:42.006 --> 42:45.237
I found the tunnel myself.
And the door, too.

42:46.410 --> 42:50.403
Pretty smart, kid, but not smart enough.

42:53.251 --> 42:56.846
There's an important shipment of rockets
on the Fort Myer wharf right now...

42:56.921 --> 43:00.186
ready to go overseas
to knock out key Nazi targets.

43:00.591 --> 43:04.652
That was the American plan.
My plan is altogether different.

43:04.862 --> 43:07.262
Just what is your plan, Baroness?

43:07.531 --> 43:10.523
Nazi spies are wiring the wharf
with dynamite.

43:10.801 --> 43:14.862
We're going to take you there,
Wonder Woman. You and Maj. Trevor.

43:15.039 --> 43:18.531
- Now doesn't that sound cozy?
- If it works.

43:18.609 --> 43:20.201
Of course it will work.

43:20.278 --> 43:22.246
And after the shipment is blown up...

43:22.313 --> 43:25.043
your bodies will be found
by the blasting lever.

43:25.249 --> 43:27.809
Two spies who died for the Nazi cause.

43:27.985 --> 43:30.351
Let Tommy go.
He has nothing to do with this.

43:30.421 --> 43:33.788
He'll be released.
After our plans are carried out.

43:33.858 --> 43:37.919
And I’m on a U-boat in the Atlantic,
safe from your democracy.

43:42.867 --> 43:44.732
We've completed the all-night search.

43:44.802 --> 43:47.134
The Baroness is no longer
in the prison compound.

43:47.204 --> 43:49.638
That's impossible.
No woman could climb these walls!

43:49.707 --> 43:51.766
I went to wake up your son,
like you asked.

43:51.842 --> 43:53.867
He's not in his room.
Can't find him anywhere.

43:53.945 --> 43:56.072
My son missing? I can't believe it.

43:56.147 --> 43:59.173
Hansen's missing, too.
He never showed up for a search detail.

43:59.250 --> 44:02.185
The Baroness, Tommy, and now Hansen.

44:02.253 --> 44:04.778
Where could they go?
How could they get out?

44:08.659 --> 44:11.685
This is Tommy's.
He calls it his "detective casebook."

44:11.796 --> 44:16.233
"Case of the old tunnel.
Clues: Magic stone near old well.

44:16.300 --> 44:20.566
"Signal lights, rusty door in wall,
hooded cloak."

44:22.606 --> 44:24.233
A secret tunnel.

44:25.042 --> 44:27.010
Perhaps there really is such a tunnel.

44:27.078 --> 44:30.809
The prison has been thoroughly searched.
This is what Tommy was talking about.

44:30.881 --> 44:32.849
Start searching
the base of the prison wall.

44:32.917 --> 44:36.512
- Search for what, sir?
- A hidden tunnel, what else? And hurry!

44:44.462 --> 44:48.057
It is real. My boy was telling the truth
and I didn't believe him.

44:56.140 --> 44:59.769
"Packard, license number 23-605."

45:00.144 --> 45:02.578
Have that number traced,
and report back to me.

45:02.646 --> 45:05.740
- Use the secret passage. It’s faster.
- Yes, sir.

45:06.884 --> 45:08.317
Search the brush.

45:14.158 --> 45:16.388
Untie him. He'll ride with us.

45:28.973 --> 45:30.497
What about her?

45:30.841 --> 45:33.674
Throw her in the trunk.
And take care of the child.

46:22.693 --> 46:25.161
- I’m going after the Baroness.
- I’ll go with you.

46:25.229 --> 46:27.720
No. You have your hands full here.

46:27.798 --> 46:30.266
And take care of my friend Tommy, please.

47:28.726 --> 47:31.490
Tommy, your father
will never doubt you again.

47:32.496 --> 47:36.364
It looks as if you're going to have more
time to read about democracy, Baroness.

47:36.433 --> 47:38.833
Lucky you find it so fascinating.

47:41.472 --> 47:45.533
Perhaps now you will appreciate it,
and learn from your unwomanly mistakes.

48:02.893 --> 48:05.327
And so, Wonder Woman
captured the Baroness.

48:05.396 --> 48:08.456
Fortunately, the missile shipment
is now safe.

48:08.866 --> 48:12.393
Good show. I’d like to have seen
Wonder Woman in action.

48:12.636 --> 48:15.036
I bet the Baroness didn't enjoy it much.

48:16.740 --> 48:19.607
The Baroness won't enjoy
much of anything for quite a while.

48:19.677 --> 48:21.440
She's in solitary confinement.

48:21.512 --> 48:24.743
And so is Arthur Deal, and Hansen,
awaiting a fair trial.

48:24.815 --> 48:27.181
I certainly hope the Baroness realizes...

48:27.251 --> 48:31.244
that freedom and democracy are
the only causes worthy of her intelligence.

48:31.455 --> 48:33.582
You're right, Diana. What a waste.

48:33.824 --> 48:37.089
It’s hard to believe.
Arthur Deal, a traitor.

48:38.195 --> 48:40.720
It seems the Nazis are capable
of almost anything.

48:40.798 --> 48:42.925
I did some research about Arthur Deal.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.935
It seems that he's a victim
of his own avarice.

48:46.770 --> 48:49.432
But perhaps he, too,
can learn from his experience.

48:49.506 --> 48:52.634
Diana, your understanding
and compassion are amazing.

48:52.710 --> 48:56.043
You really do believe that people
can learn to change for the better?

48:56.113 --> 48:59.105
Yes. Where I was raised, we were taught...

48:59.483 --> 49:01.644
that good must triumph over evil...

49:01.885 --> 49:05.082
and that women and men can learn.

49:38.722 --> 49:39.746
