00:28.720 --> 00:31.960
Uh, the risk of
the coronavirus remains low,

00:32.000 --> 00:34.080
according to all of the experts.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.000
The government is in control...

00:40.000 --> 00:42.120
The government is in control...

00:49.680 --> 00:51.240
When I was a boy,

00:51.280 --> 00:53.840
I thought happiness
was a destination...

01:01.760 --> 01:03.480
..so I ran far away from home.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.000
Zhi?

01:20.000 --> 01:20.760
Zhi?

01:20.800 --> 01:21.840
He's back.

01:21.880 --> 01:23.840
He'll be in court this morning.

01:23.880 --> 01:26.440
Did he call?
His barrister.

01:26.480 --> 01:28.000
It won't be long now, Zhi.

01:28.000 --> 01:28.280
It won't be long now, Zhi.

01:34.520 --> 01:36.000
My client vigorously denies
the money laundering charges
against him.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.600
My client vigorously denies
the money laundering charges
against him.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.880
I made more money
than anyone should...

01:40.920 --> 01:42.400
After four years in exile,

01:42.440 --> 01:44.000
he's surrendered
to clear his name.

01:44.000 --> 01:44.600
he's surrendered
to clear his name.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.600
..and became
unrecognisable to myself.

01:53.240 --> 01:55.480
Stop it!

01:55.520 --> 01:56.920
Boys, cut it out.

02:00.240 --> 02:01.240
Toyah?

02:01.280 --> 02:04.160
I know it's not my turn,
but can you keep the boys tonight?

02:04.200 --> 02:06.680
I've gotta work a second shift!
Toy, come on...

02:06.720 --> 02:07.960
I haven't got time to talk,

02:08.000 --> 02:10.720
but Carter's got a spelling test,
so make sure he studies.

02:10.760 --> 02:13.320
Yeah, all right, I've got it...
I'll call you later, OK?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
All right, looks like you guys
are spending the night here.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.400
All right, looks like you guys
are spending the night here.

02:18.320 --> 02:19.400
Come on, let's go!

02:24.040 --> 02:25.680
But the further I run...

02:25.720 --> 02:30.040
Mister Ruggero has already posted
a Â£5 million surety.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.000
..the further my destination became.

02:32.000 --> 02:32.880
..the further my destination became.

02:32.920 --> 02:36.240
You may ask about
the, uh, coronavirus,

02:36.280 --> 02:38.520
which is very well under control
in our country.

02:38.560 --> 02:40.000
Trump holds a news conference
concerning the coronavirus pandemic,

02:40.000 --> 02:42.360
Trump holds a news conference
concerning the coronavirus pandemic,

02:42.400 --> 02:43.880
stating it's incredible

02:43.920 --> 02:47.160
but it's something
that we have tremendous control of.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.720
He's up to something.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.000
A man gets tired of running.

02:56.000 --> 02:56.840
A man gets tired of running.

02:56.880 --> 02:58.680
Why surrender to you?

02:58.720 --> 03:01.440
Why not
turn himself in to the police?

03:01.480 --> 03:04.000
But I wasn't
running towards happiness.

03:04.000 --> 03:04.040
But I wasn't
running towards happiness.

03:04.080 --> 03:07.240
My client is innocent
of the charges before him.

03:07.280 --> 03:10.600
I had only run into a cage
I'd built myself.

03:51.560 --> 03:52.000
Good news?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.120
Good news?

03:53.160 --> 03:55.960
He has to wear an electronic tag,
but he's been released.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
OK, when can I see him?
Not yet.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.000
They could be watching him.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.440
They could be watching him.

04:00.480 --> 04:03.120
He doesn't want you or Claire
in any danger.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.400
Communicate through me
until we know it's safe.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.840
Hmm... It took you long enough.

05:01.080 --> 05:03.040
Risk at the current time
to the UK is low.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.000
This is a problem that's essentially
focused within China

05:04.000 --> 05:06.400
This is a problem that's essentially
focused within China

05:06.440 --> 05:08.440
and we shouldn't see
any cases in the UK.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.000
They have no idea what's coming.

05:12.000 --> 05:12.120
They have no idea what's coming.

05:22.240 --> 05:23.400
And you do?

05:26.160 --> 05:28.000
What's the play?
It involves you, of course.

05:28.000 --> 05:28.640
What's the play?
It involves you, of course.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.880
Oh, now we're friends again?
We never were.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.000
But we only win this fight
if we do it together.

05:36.000 --> 05:36.840
But we only win this fight
if we do it together.

05:36.880 --> 05:37.880
Hmm.

05:39.120 --> 05:40.840
Trump says "America first..."

05:41.920 --> 05:43.720
..and insults his allies,

05:43.760 --> 05:44.000
while China sends aid...

05:44.000 --> 05:45.240
while China sends aid...

05:46.720 --> 05:48.960
..increasing its influence
around the world.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.000
The American economy
is in free fall.

05:52.000 --> 05:52.280
The American economy
is in free fall.

05:52.960 --> 05:56.440
And China will come out of this
stronger than ever.

05:57.960 --> 06:00.000
You're not here to help me defeat
the Chinese Government.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.680
You're not here to help me defeat
the Chinese Government.

06:00.720 --> 06:03.200
I'm here to offer you a deal.

06:03.240 --> 06:07.120
A deal?
To protect America and Europe.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.000
I understand
you want your life back,

06:08.000 --> 06:08.960
I understand
you want your life back,

06:09.000 --> 06:10.960
but you're in no position to deal.

06:14.120 --> 06:16.000
My position is stronger than yours.

06:16.000 --> 06:16.200
My position is stronger than yours.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.120
Data thrives in a pandemic.

06:19.160 --> 06:20.640
I'm doing better than ever.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.080
Hmm... You should be.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.000
But your chief investor
is intent on using your data

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
But your chief investor
is intent on using your data

06:27.040 --> 06:29.120
to spread
disinformation and chaos.

06:31.280 --> 06:32.000
How do you know that?

06:32.000 --> 06:32.360
How do you know that?

06:35.560 --> 06:38.120
While you were in Milan with me,

06:38.160 --> 06:40.000
Nadya slipped into your office.

06:40.000 --> 06:40.120
Nadya slipped into your office.

06:41.720 --> 06:44.200
Copied the files
you keep on Rebecca Farmer.

06:45.480 --> 06:46.880
My, you have been busy...

06:49.480 --> 06:51.280
I wondered what became of Nadya.

06:51.320 --> 06:54.800
Rebecca Farmer was a necessary evil.

06:54.840 --> 06:56.000
Now she's just evil...

06:56.000 --> 06:58.560
Now she's just evil...

06:58.600 --> 07:01.680
If I could've got rid of her,
I would've a long time ago.

07:01.720 --> 07:04.000
Now you can, with my help.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.040
Now you can, with my help.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.000
What's in it for you?

07:12.000 --> 07:12.280
What's in it for you?

07:13.400 --> 07:15.400
Justice.

07:15.440 --> 07:16.920
For you?
For everyone.

07:21.560 --> 07:22.960
All right, then...

07:24.320 --> 07:25.320
How?

07:29.640 --> 07:32.360
The coronavirus continues to
impact the global economy,

07:32.400 --> 07:34.120
with oil prices taking a dive today

07:34.160 --> 07:36.000
after Russia
refused to cut oil production.

07:36.000 --> 07:36.640
after Russia
refused to cut oil production.

07:38.840 --> 07:39.840
Can you do it?

07:42.280 --> 07:43.600
Zhi and Eleanor can.

07:45.320 --> 07:48.480
I know you're considering how
the Saudi Government should respond

07:48.520 --> 07:50.480
in light of Russian intransigence.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.000
Oil prices
will only continue to go down

07:52.000 --> 07:53.160
Oil prices
will only continue to go down

07:53.200 --> 07:54.280
unless we take action.

07:54.320 --> 07:57.480
And the Russians
don't intend to follow your lead.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.320
It's a problem.

07:59.360 --> 08:00.000
Demand will continue to weaken
as the pandemic worsens.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.440
Demand will continue to weaken
as the pandemic worsens.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.280
You have to confront them head-on.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.160
We have no leverage.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.000
Actually, you have quite a bit,

08:08.000 --> 08:09.600
Actually, you have quite a bit,

08:09.640 --> 08:11.600
and a greater share of the market.

08:12.480 --> 08:14.800
You can afford to
teach them a lesson.

08:14.840 --> 08:16.000
And believe me, Your Highness,

08:16.000 --> 08:17.240
And believe me, Your Highness,

08:17.280 --> 08:20.280
it's a lesson
you'd only have to teach once.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.680
Rather than cutting supply,

08:23.720 --> 08:24.000
the Saudis stunned the world
by glutting the oil market.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.800
the Saudis stunned the world
by glutting the oil market.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.720
Prices have fallen 30%,

08:28.760 --> 08:30.640
the largest drop since the Gulf War.

08:30.680 --> 08:32.000
It's more costly
to store oil than to sell it,

08:32.000 --> 08:33.320
It's more costly
to store oil than to sell it,

08:33.360 --> 08:35.160
so prices are actually negative.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.200
Shit...

08:38.400 --> 08:40.000
Stonehouse and Liwei want to see us.

08:40.000 --> 08:40.560
Stonehouse and Liwei want to see us.

08:40.600 --> 08:41.600
Now.

08:42.760 --> 08:44.720
How much did the Saudi move cost us?

08:46.200 --> 08:48.000
Well, conservatively,
I'd estimate, um...

08:48.000 --> 08:48.840
Well, conservatively,
I'd estimate, um...

08:48.880 --> 08:51.120
Five hundred million.

08:51.160 --> 08:53.800
Well, oil's not our only problem.

08:53.840 --> 08:56.000
The entire global economy
is in free fall.

08:56.040 --> 08:57.440
We're bleeding everywhere.

08:57.480 --> 08:58.720
It's 2008 all over again.

08:58.760 --> 09:00.920
There is one bright spot, of course.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.440
Technology and data.

09:03.680 --> 09:04.000
Our investments in China and Korea
will recover more quickly
than those in the West,

09:04.000 --> 09:07.920
Our investments in China and Korea
will recover more quickly
than those in the West,

09:07.960 --> 09:11.040
due to aggressive use
of contact-tracing apps,

09:11.080 --> 09:12.000
rapid development of vaccines

09:12.000 --> 09:13.160
rapid development of vaccines

09:13.200 --> 09:18.160
and the more...cohesive nature
of society there.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.200
How quickly?

09:19.240 --> 09:20.000
If China can control the virus

09:20.000 --> 09:20.800
If China can control the virus

09:20.840 --> 09:23.800
and start vaccinating
before the end of the year,

09:23.840 --> 09:26.720
it could actually see
positive economic growth in 2020.

09:27.880 --> 09:28.000
So, you're telling me that,
right now,

09:28.000 --> 09:29.760
So, you're telling me that,
right now,

09:29.800 --> 09:30.800
without China,

09:30.840 --> 09:32.920
NYL is screwed.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.520
You've got us over a barrel.

09:35.560 --> 09:36.000
What I am saying, Jeremy,
is that China is your friend

09:36.000 --> 09:39.200
What I am saying, Jeremy,
is that China is your friend

09:39.240 --> 09:42.040
and will carry you
through these unpredictable times.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.000
At what price down the road?

09:44.000 --> 09:44.160
At what price down the road?

09:45.680 --> 09:47.320
Who knows what the future holds...

09:48.320 --> 09:49.480
This isn't good enough.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.000
I have a plane to catch.

09:52.000 --> 09:52.120
I have a plane to catch.

09:52.840 --> 09:53.840
You will fix this.

10:05.760 --> 10:07.640
We're bankers, not fuckin' wizards.

10:10.320 --> 10:11.320
Hello?

10:13.160 --> 10:14.960
Yeah, no...
Yeah, I'll be right there.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Yeah.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.000
Hey, I'm looking for Latoyah Harris.

10:24.000 --> 10:24.600
Hey, I'm looking for Latoyah Harris.

10:24.640 --> 10:25.640
I got it...

10:25.680 --> 10:26.760
Are you her husband?

10:28.200 --> 10:29.840
Her ex-husband, yeah.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.000
The fever came on quickly
after this morning.

10:32.000 --> 10:32.120
The fever came on quickly
after this morning.

10:32.160 --> 10:33.320
She fainted an hour ago.

10:33.360 --> 10:35.760
Well, where is she?
I'm sorry, no visitors.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.880
I can give her a message,
if you'd like.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.320
Nurse, please...
Excuse me.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.760
How did you get in here?

11:25.800 --> 11:27.800
Hey... I had to see you.

11:27.840 --> 11:28.000
Well, you have...

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Well, you have...

11:30.080 --> 11:31.720
Now, please, get out of here.

11:31.760 --> 11:33.240
The kids need you healthy.

11:33.280 --> 11:36.000
How are you feeling, Toy?
Awful.

11:36.000 --> 11:36.760
How are you feeling, Toy?
Awful.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.200
You're gonna be OK, right?

11:40.240 --> 11:43.200
Who knows how much I was exposed to,
but I'll be fine.

11:43.240 --> 11:44.000
Now, please, Oliver,
get out of here.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.040
Now, please, Oliver,
get out of here.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.240
All right, all right!

11:46.280 --> 11:48.680
Now! Go!
All right, all right, I'm going!

11:50.440 --> 11:51.440
I'll be back...

11:52.600 --> 11:54.680
You'd better not be, Oliver Harris.

11:56.920 --> 11:57.920
Now, go!

12:10.320 --> 12:11.800
Group B... Did you get that?

12:15.040 --> 12:16.000
Could I have a moment?

12:16.000 --> 12:16.040
Could I have a moment?

12:24.040 --> 12:25.680
It's the end of the world out there.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.240
Oil prices.

12:29.280 --> 12:31.160
They're below zero.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.000
It's cheaper to
pour it away than store it.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
It's cheaper to
pour it away than store it.

12:34.040 --> 12:36.200
A lot of people hurting right now.

12:36.240 --> 12:37.720
Yeah...

12:37.760 --> 12:38.920
This could destroy me.

12:40.560 --> 12:43.360
I'm going to have to
liquidate my shares.

12:43.400 --> 12:45.880
I'm sorry to hear that, Rebecca.

12:45.920 --> 12:46.920
Are you?

12:49.440 --> 12:51.920
I think you wanted me
out of here for years.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.360
We've had our differences.
To put it mildly.

12:54.400 --> 12:55.400
Hmm...

12:55.440 --> 12:56.000
You HATE having to
answer to me and my agenda.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.400
You HATE having to
answer to me and my agenda.

13:00.520 --> 13:04.000
And how convenient
that I'm wiped out

13:04.040 --> 13:06.920
just as the value of data
is about to skyrocket...

13:08.960 --> 13:12.000
I had
nothing to do with the collapse
of the world oil market.

13:12.000 --> 13:12.760
I had
nothing to do with the collapse
of the world oil market.

13:16.040 --> 13:17.920
Excuse me...

13:17.960 --> 13:18.960
Yes?

13:19.720 --> 13:20.000
I'll be right there.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.200
I'll be right there.

13:21.240 --> 13:22.800
Sorry...

13:22.840 --> 13:24.840
Let me know
how you'd like to proceed.

13:40.640 --> 13:42.880
Well, well, hell freezes over...

13:45.040 --> 13:46.680
Let's see how chilly things get.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.000
Nadya is back from Warsaw, I see.

13:52.000 --> 13:52.680
Nadya is back from Warsaw, I see.

13:55.160 --> 13:58.880
Oil prices plummeted, as promised.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.000
Yes... Rebecca's fuming.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Yes... Rebecca's fuming.

14:02.040 --> 14:03.680
I can't say I'm not enjoying it.

14:04.960 --> 14:08.000
OK, Massimo, what can I do for you?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.200
OK, Massimo, what can I do for you?

14:09.240 --> 14:11.880
Help me take over NYL.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.240
You can't be serious...

14:14.280 --> 14:16.000
It would weaken Chinamerica
and help protect European data.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.600
It would weaken Chinamerica
and help protect European data.

14:17.640 --> 14:19.360
And make us
a hell of a lot of money.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.720
This pandemic is our chance.

14:21.760 --> 14:24.000
We seize it or lose it forever.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.160
We seize it or lose it forever.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.840
NYL has assets of over $1 trillion.

14:28.880 --> 14:32.000
When the outbreak in Wuhan
was first reported in January,

14:32.000 --> 14:32.280
When the outbreak in Wuhan
was first reported in January,

14:32.320 --> 14:34.560
Massimo foresaw
the effect it would have.

14:36.480 --> 14:39.200
It's nice to see
you haven't lost your golden touch.

14:39.240 --> 14:40.000
Zhi and I reached out to Carolina
on Massimo's behalf.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.240
Zhi and I reached out to Carolina
on Massimo's behalf.

14:42.280 --> 14:45.680
They persuaded me to hedge risk
against a possible pandemic,

14:45.720 --> 14:48.000
placing a massive short
on the market.

14:48.000 --> 14:48.800
placing a massive short
on the market.

14:48.840 --> 14:51.480
Congratulations.
I'm sure you made a lot of money.

14:51.520 --> 14:54.600
But not enough to buy NYL.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.080
They could...

14:58.800 --> 15:00.120
..with my help.

15:02.120 --> 15:04.000
Your help?
And my friends.

15:04.000 --> 15:04.840
Your help?
And my friends.

15:04.880 --> 15:08.680
Your friends from Flamestar
want to help us?

15:08.720 --> 15:11.680
They want to make a statement,
and so do I.

15:14.440 --> 15:19.000
Finance, like basketball,
is a team sport.

15:32.760 --> 15:33.840
Interesting...

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
What does that mean?
It means we wait.

15:44.000 --> 15:44.240
What does that mean?
It means we wait.

15:45.440 --> 15:48.600
In France, the whole country
is now in lockdown.

15:48.640 --> 15:51.440
The economic impact
could be very strong.

15:51.480 --> 15:52.000
Schengen or no Schengen,
we are in such a globalised world.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.480
Schengen or no Schengen,
we are in such a globalised world.

15:55.520 --> 15:58.240
The coronavirus is still spreading!

16:02.120 --> 16:03.520
Madame?

16:04.600 --> 16:06.000
Is this really necessary?

16:09.080 --> 16:11.400
Rebecca... How are you?

16:13.200 --> 16:14.200
Wiped out.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.000
But then, you already know that.

16:16.000 --> 16:16.040
But then, you already know that.

16:16.080 --> 16:17.160
You're the reason why.

16:17.200 --> 16:20.280
No, it wasn't us. It was the Saudis.

16:21.320 --> 16:23.560
Due to Russian intransigence.

16:23.600 --> 16:24.000
Maybe you should have diversified

16:24.000 --> 16:25.240
Maybe you should have diversified

16:25.280 --> 16:27.760
rather than complaining about
the vagaries of fate.

16:27.800 --> 16:32.000
FATE may have had a helping hand...

16:32.000 --> 16:32.040
FATE may have had a helping hand...

16:34.320 --> 16:35.720
Dominic Morgan.

16:35.760 --> 16:38.640
Dominic knew I'd be forced
to liquidate if oil prices fell.

16:38.680 --> 16:39.680
And if I'm gone,

16:39.720 --> 16:40.000
we can no longer use that data
for our political purposes,

16:40.000 --> 16:43.520
we can no longer use that data
for our political purposes,

16:43.560 --> 16:46.360
making MY problem YOUR problem.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.440
What do you propose?
I have one card left...

16:53.440 --> 16:55.760
But you have to
be the one who plays it.

17:10.600 --> 17:11.760
Is that your daughter?

17:15.880 --> 17:16.880
Claire, yes.

17:18.440 --> 17:19.440
She's beautiful.

17:22.160 --> 17:23.640
I'm going to meet her soon.

17:23.680 --> 17:25.840
Four years, you stayed away...

17:25.880 --> 17:27.680
You think
they'd hurt her to hurt you?

17:27.720 --> 17:28.000
I don't know,
but I decided not to take the risk.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.440
I don't know,
but I decided not to take the risk.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.080
How are the boys doing?

17:35.120 --> 17:36.000
Adrian loves getting presents
from his favourite
fugitive godfather.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.680
Adrian loves getting presents
from his favourite
fugitive godfather.

17:41.800 --> 17:44.000
Latoyah?
She's in hospital. Coronavirus.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.440
Latoyah?
She's in hospital. Coronavirus.

17:47.480 --> 17:51.280
A lot of the staff were exposed to
God knows how much of it,

17:51.320 --> 17:52.000
working in the ICU.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.120
working in the ICU.

17:53.160 --> 17:54.960
I'm sorry.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.320
I should never have
let her get away.

18:04.240 --> 18:05.560
I need your help.

18:08.040 --> 18:11.280
Look, Liwei's been fair to me,

18:11.320 --> 18:14.400
so if you're here
to tell me to go against NYL...

18:14.440 --> 18:15.920
This isn't about fairness.

18:17.280 --> 18:18.280
Look around...

18:19.560 --> 18:22.120
What do you see?
People.

18:22.160 --> 18:24.000
Their lives are changing,
but they don't know it yet.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.640
Their lives are changing,
but they don't know it yet.

18:25.680 --> 18:27.000
What do you mean?

18:27.040 --> 18:29.440
They said we'd be in lockdown
for six weeks.

18:29.480 --> 18:30.880
Try 16 months...

18:30.920 --> 18:32.000
If we get a vaccine.

18:32.000 --> 18:32.640
If we get a vaccine.

18:32.680 --> 18:34.400
Millions of people will die.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.120
Millions of businesses.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.640
This isn't just a pandemic,

18:42.680 --> 18:45.320
I think it's
a fundamental reordering of society.

18:47.760 --> 18:48.000
If what you're saying is true,
I can't do anything about it.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.320
If what you're saying is true,
I can't do anything about it.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.640
We could... Together.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.400
In China,

18:59.440 --> 19:03.080
track and trace using
facial recognition is implemented,

19:03.120 --> 19:04.000
freedom of movement restricted

19:04.000 --> 19:04.760
freedom of movement restricted

19:04.800 --> 19:08.360
and large-scale, temporary hospitals
built to combat the epidemic.

19:14.600 --> 19:17.080
I didn't know
you were a basketball fan.

19:18.280 --> 19:19.360
I grew up in Boston.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.360
I'm a Bill Russell fan.

19:24.440 --> 19:26.840
The most successful player
in NBA history.

19:29.040 --> 19:30.280
He didn't like to lose.

19:36.960 --> 19:38.280
To what do I owe this visit?

19:39.920 --> 19:42.920
I'm extending Rebecca
a credit facility of Â£2.5 billion.

19:46.440 --> 19:48.440
I'm happy for you,

19:48.480 --> 19:51.360
but you didn't need to come here
to tell me that.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.000
As security,
I've surrendered my shares.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.360
As security,
I've surrendered my shares.

19:55.400 --> 19:56.640
In your firm.

19:58.640 --> 20:00.000
Combining her shares with mine
gives me controlling interest.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.880
Combining her shares with mine
gives me controlling interest.

20:06.360 --> 20:08.000
You thought you could use me
then throw me away.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.520
You thought you could use me
then throw me away.

20:12.160 --> 20:14.800
You're desperate, Rebecca,
and this is a bad deal.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.560
It's worth every penny
just to see you squirm.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.400
I was hoping to see you. Come in.

20:48.240 --> 20:49.880
Good morning.
Morning.

20:50.840 --> 20:52.320
We'll keep in touch. Thank you.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.960
Who was that?
My barrister.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.640
Trial's coming up.

21:00.680 --> 21:01.680
How's that looking?

21:02.480 --> 21:04.000
Not great...

21:04.000 --> 21:04.120
Not great...

21:04.160 --> 21:05.240
Sorry to hear that.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.920
Do you want a coffee?
Please.

21:06.960 --> 21:08.680
But you know I warned you.

21:08.720 --> 21:12.000
It'd be better if you made
the evidence against me go away.

21:12.000 --> 21:12.200
It'd be better if you made
the evidence against me go away.

21:12.240 --> 21:13.480
How could I do that?

21:14.640 --> 21:16.960
By proving that
they got it through your spyware.

21:17.920 --> 21:19.640
They would have to drop the charges.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.000
Rebecca Farmer has relinquished
control of her shares.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.240
Rebecca Farmer has relinquished
control of her shares.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.160
That's good.

21:31.200 --> 21:35.160
She's given her shares
to Anton Kozlov.

21:35.200 --> 21:36.000
Now he controls me.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.080
Now he controls me.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.160
That's not good.

21:42.960 --> 21:44.000
But not unexpected.

21:44.000 --> 21:44.040
But not unexpected.

21:45.480 --> 21:48.560
You were hoping, by ruining Rebecca,

21:48.600 --> 21:50.920
it would push me
out of the frying pan,

21:50.960 --> 21:51.960
into the fire,

21:52.000 --> 21:53.400
forcing me to take your deal.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.600
You give me too much credit.

21:57.440 --> 21:58.440
Do I?

21:58.480 --> 22:00.000
Either way,
you're left with a choice.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.040
Either way,
you're left with a choice.

22:02.080 --> 22:05.720
Take over NYL or get taken over.

22:10.240 --> 22:13.960
See, Jeremy Stonehouse
is not only the global CEO of NYL...

22:15.600 --> 22:16.000
He is the head of the 13th floor.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.480
He is the head of the 13th floor.

22:18.520 --> 22:20.920
So, for you to take over his bank,

22:20.960 --> 22:24.000
we win or we get wiped out.

22:24.000 --> 22:24.600
we win or we get wiped out.

22:26.920 --> 22:27.920
We'll win.

22:29.240 --> 22:31.120
Well?

22:35.800 --> 22:37.280
Do it.

22:37.320 --> 22:38.480
Right away.

22:41.760 --> 22:42.760
We're on.

22:44.560 --> 22:46.360
Give this to the team.
OK.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.000
Guys, these are orders
for credit default swaps.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.800
Guys, these are orders
for credit default swaps.

22:49.840 --> 22:51.640
I want them purchased right away,
OK?

22:54.240 --> 22:55.640
For fuck's sake...

22:58.560 --> 22:59.880
Chris, what's the matter?

22:59.920 --> 23:03.000
Someone's buying millions of pounds
in credit default swaps.

23:03.040 --> 23:04.000
Against who?
Against us!

23:04.000 --> 23:06.120
Against who?
Against us!

23:06.160 --> 23:07.160
NYL!

23:07.200 --> 23:08.920
They're attacking us!

23:08.960 --> 23:09.960
So, what do we do?

23:12.400 --> 23:15.640
How many CDS' have they purchased?
There's no way of knowing...

23:15.680 --> 23:16.840
But it must be a lot.

23:16.880 --> 23:18.360
And they're still buying.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.000
While spreading rumours
that our bank is weak.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.480
While spreading rumours
that our bank is weak.

23:21.520 --> 23:23.400
Sounds like a familiar strategy...

23:23.440 --> 23:25.760
Straight out of Massimo's playbook.

23:25.800 --> 23:28.000
He blows the whistle
and the market follows.

23:28.000 --> 23:28.680
He blows the whistle
and the market follows.

23:28.720 --> 23:32.440
Has he spoken to you?
Yeah...

23:32.480 --> 23:33.480
But not about this.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.760
We must buy up
more shares ourselves.

23:39.800 --> 23:42.200
Our reserves are strapped...

23:42.240 --> 23:44.000
That's why he's doing this now,
to turn our stock into junk!

23:44.000 --> 23:44.960
That's why he's doing this now,
to turn our stock into junk!

23:46.920 --> 23:49.080
Massimo can't have acted alone.

24:09.120 --> 24:13.360
It's been a long time.
It has.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.000
You look well.
Motherhood agrees with you.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.600
You look well.
Motherhood agrees with you.

24:17.640 --> 24:19.200
I have to get home...

24:19.240 --> 24:23.240
I know you're behind the attack
on NYL, Zhi,

24:23.280 --> 24:24.000
and that your client is Massimo,

24:24.000 --> 24:25.600
and that your client is Massimo,

24:25.640 --> 24:28.040
working with Dominic Morgan.

24:28.080 --> 24:30.560
You know I can't tell you
either way.

24:32.560 --> 24:34.200
You don't have to, I know you.

24:35.320 --> 24:37.960
And I know this must weigh on you,

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
betraying me and your country.

24:40.000 --> 24:40.800
betraying me and your country.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.120
How long have you lived in London?

24:51.720 --> 24:53.040
Ten, 12 years?

24:56.000 --> 25:00.800
A person gets accustomed to a place,

25:00.840 --> 25:04.000
perhaps she starts to forget
this is not your home.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.720
perhaps she starts to forget
this is not your home.

25:07.560 --> 25:12.000
These people are not your friends.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.360
These people are not your friends.

25:18.040 --> 25:20.000
I know who my friends are,

25:20.000 --> 25:20.520
I know who my friends are,

25:20.560 --> 25:22.880
and I'm free to make up my own mind.

25:26.720 --> 25:28.000
There are different
kinds of freedom.

25:28.000 --> 25:28.800
There are different
kinds of freedom.

25:30.600 --> 25:33.600
The West attacks us
for controlling our own people,

25:33.640 --> 25:36.000
but our control
will save tens of millions of lives.

25:36.000 --> 25:36.720
but our control
will save tens of millions of lives.

25:38.240 --> 25:41.800
While their so-called freedom
means they mount a pitiful defence,

25:41.840 --> 25:43.640
letting millions die.

25:45.920 --> 25:50.000
The capacity to live, Zhi.

25:51.520 --> 25:52.000
What greater freedom is there?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.080
What greater freedom is there?

25:56.120 --> 25:58.280
I'm not going to debate with you.

25:58.320 --> 26:00.000
Because you know I'm right.

26:00.000 --> 26:00.040
Because you know I'm right.

26:05.680 --> 26:07.080
This is a turning point...

26:08.320 --> 26:12.640
Turn your back on your country now
and you may live to regret it.

26:19.560 --> 26:21.120
Consider your future...

26:28.240 --> 26:29.480
..and your daughter's.

26:41.680 --> 26:42.680
From this evening,

26:42.720 --> 26:46.040
I must give the British people
a very simple instruction.

26:46.080 --> 26:48.000
You MUST stay at home.

26:48.000 --> 26:48.320
You MUST stay at home.

26:53.600 --> 26:55.400
You're still in the office.
Mmm.

26:56.600 --> 26:58.600
Most of my people
are working from home.

27:01.600 --> 27:03.480
Strange times.
Mm-hm.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.640
Do you have an offer to make?

27:07.680 --> 27:11.320
I've lined up backers
who will buy your shares
at twice their face value.

27:13.960 --> 27:14.960
Tempting...

27:16.040 --> 27:19.280
But our friends in Moscow
see strategic value
in the data you control.

27:19.320 --> 27:20.000
They should reconsider.

27:20.000 --> 27:20.560
They should reconsider.

27:23.080 --> 27:24.640
Trump's gonna lose the election.

27:25.800 --> 27:28.000
And what makes you say that?
He's mishandled the pandemic.

27:28.000 --> 27:28.880
And what makes you say that?
He's mishandled the pandemic.

27:34.400 --> 27:35.400
Hmm...

27:35.440 --> 27:36.000
But this isn't about
your dislike for Trump.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.320
But this isn't about
your dislike for Trump.

27:38.360 --> 27:40.320
It's about your dislike for me.

27:40.360 --> 27:42.160
If the Democrats
win the White House,

27:42.200 --> 27:43.840
your name will sink this firm.

27:43.880 --> 27:44.000
So, you either take
a handsome profit now

27:44.000 --> 27:46.520
So, you either take
a handsome profit now

27:46.560 --> 27:48.640
or a massive hit in six months.

27:50.920 --> 27:52.000
Not much of a choice, is it?

27:52.000 --> 27:52.320
Not much of a choice, is it?

27:58.120 --> 27:59.200
Well...?

27:59.240 --> 28:00.000
You ready for tomorrow?
I think so.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.800
You ready for tomorrow?
I think so.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.920
You do know we don't have
enough money to buy NYL?

28:04.960 --> 28:07.760
But we have Nadya.

28:07.800 --> 28:08.000
Do you think she can do it?
She's the future.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.200
Do you think she can do it?
She's the future.

28:14.320 --> 28:16.000
Germany finally joins
Italy, France and Spain

28:16.000 --> 28:17.400
Germany finally joins
Italy, France and Spain

28:17.440 --> 28:19.160
in imposing a total lockdown.

28:19.200 --> 28:21.680
What are those tubes for, Mummy?

28:21.720 --> 28:24.000
I've got a stuffy nose.
They help me breathe.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.800
I've got a stuffy nose.
They help me breathe.

28:25.840 --> 28:28.640
Do I look funny?
Sort of!

28:29.480 --> 28:32.000
Well, the two of you look just fine.

28:32.000 --> 28:32.360
Well, the two of you look just fine.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.880
I'm glad daddy's
taking such good care of you.

28:34.920 --> 28:35.920
Mm-hm...

28:35.960 --> 28:38.600
All right, come on, time to eat.
Talk to you tomorrow.

28:38.640 --> 28:39.880
Bye, Mummy! Love you!

28:39.920 --> 28:40.000
All right...

28:40.000 --> 28:41.720
All right...

28:41.760 --> 28:42.760
Here you go.

28:42.800 --> 28:47.760
Hey, you feeling better?
Do I look like I'm feeling better?

28:49.520 --> 28:53.400
What about the spelling test?
Well, he can spell medieval!

28:54.360 --> 28:55.760
I don't even think I can...

28:59.080 --> 29:00.400
Look, how you really doing?

29:02.560 --> 29:04.000
Oxygen level is low,
but I'll be fine.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.640
Oxygen level is low,
but I'll be fine.

29:08.920 --> 29:11.920
Look, you remember that little
Italian place we used to go to?

29:13.680 --> 29:16.240
Are you asking me out on a date...?

29:16.280 --> 29:20.000
Well, if I was, what would you say?

29:20.000 --> 29:20.160
Well, if I was, what would you say?

29:20.200 --> 29:22.000
Oliver, I couldn't...

29:24.520 --> 29:25.520
Why not?

29:27.240 --> 29:28.000
I need to know
that there'd be no more lies.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.320
I need to know
that there'd be no more lies.

29:30.600 --> 29:31.600
No more betrayals.

29:33.160 --> 29:35.160
That you'd try to be a good man.

29:35.200 --> 29:36.000
I would, Toy. Promise.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.280
I would, Toy. Promise.

29:37.320 --> 29:40.880
Hmm... Too quick.

29:42.600 --> 29:44.000
Look, rest and get better, OK?

29:44.000 --> 29:44.840
Look, rest and get better, OK?

29:46.320 --> 29:47.880
Then maybe I'll change your mind.

29:47.920 --> 29:48.920
Maybe...

30:03.440 --> 30:06.160
Are you there?
Almost.

30:06.200 --> 30:08.000
Is Zhi ready?
She's a fighter.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.200
Is Zhi ready?
She's a fighter.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.320
Something
your daughter has inherited,

30:12.360 --> 30:14.840
along with your stubborn streak.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.000
We are stubborn, I know.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.040
We are stubborn, I know.

30:17.080 --> 30:19.240
Yeah, big time...

30:19.280 --> 30:22.000
But she's also clever and kind.

30:22.040 --> 30:24.000
So, she'll never make a banker!

30:24.000 --> 30:25.200
So, she'll never make a banker!

30:26.960 --> 30:28.840
You'll see for yourself soon enough.

30:30.160 --> 30:31.160
Yes...

30:35.960 --> 30:36.960
Gotta go.

30:48.640 --> 30:51.960
Where are we at?
NYL opened at 38.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.320
Down 10%.

30:53.360 --> 30:56.000
Ten percent?
The biggest drop ever on NYL shares.

30:56.000 --> 30:56.240
Ten percent?
The biggest drop ever on NYL shares.

30:56.280 --> 31:00.760
NYL shares started the day
already weakened at Â£38,

31:00.800 --> 31:03.280
and are now inching down to Â£37.

31:05.400 --> 31:06.640
Is Dominic here?

31:13.720 --> 31:14.720
NYL's at 37.

31:19.680 --> 31:20.000
Well?
We've, um...

31:20.000 --> 31:22.160
Well?
We've, um...

31:22.200 --> 31:25.280
We've taken countermeasures,
but the market's against us.

31:26.360 --> 31:28.000
Our share price just keeps dropping.

31:28.000 --> 31:28.160
Our share price just keeps dropping.

31:33.360 --> 31:35.320
What the hell is going on
in London?

31:35.360 --> 31:36.000
We're down to 36!

31:36.000 --> 31:36.440
We're down to 36!

31:36.480 --> 31:38.880
I'm sure Liwei is on top of it.

31:38.920 --> 31:40.480
Well, he sure as hell better be!

31:40.520 --> 31:42.400
Gentlemen, thank you for being here.

31:47.240 --> 31:49.200
What do we do now?
We wait.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.400
Oh, come on, come on, come on...

31:51.440 --> 31:52.000
Keep an eye on this for me, please?

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
Keep an eye on this for me, please?

31:53.040 --> 31:54.040
Yes? Thank you...

31:54.920 --> 31:56.400
Holy Christ...

31:56.440 --> 31:57.440
Keep your nerve.

31:57.480 --> 31:59.120
We're in the toilet here!

31:59.160 --> 32:00.000
What makes you such a bloody Buddha?

32:00.000 --> 32:00.880
What makes you such a bloody Buddha?

32:00.920 --> 32:04.320
Liwei will act.
I fuckin' hope so.

32:05.520 --> 32:07.840
You've seen the news?
Yes.

32:07.880 --> 32:08.000
Then you know
our bank is under attack.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.960
Then you know
our bank is under attack.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.320
They'll take it over
unless we get support.

32:19.120 --> 32:21.200
Another 20 million! Let's go!

32:21.240 --> 32:22.720
We're in a pandemic.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.000
Our nation's resources
are not endless.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.320
Our nation's resources
are not endless.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.000
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

32:32.000 --> 32:32.600
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

32:37.200 --> 32:38.760
What the hell is he doing in there?

32:41.720 --> 32:45.880
We will lose the bank
without additional capital now.

32:52.480 --> 32:55.440
We must project strength,
not weakness.

32:55.480 --> 32:56.000
I understand
you don't want to lose face...

32:56.000 --> 32:57.640
I understand
you don't want to lose face...

32:57.680 --> 32:59.240
This is not about face.

33:00.480 --> 33:02.640
This is about
the pride of the Chinese people!

33:08.480 --> 33:10.560
Keep your eye on there
as well for me, please.

33:10.600 --> 33:11.600
Thank you.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.080
Buy!

33:16.880 --> 33:18.520
How much?
One hundred million.

33:19.800 --> 33:20.000
Will that be enough?
It better be.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.360
Will that be enough?
It better be.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.360
OK, let's do it, let's buy, please!

33:26.400 --> 33:27.880
Yes, are we on that? Thank you!

33:27.920 --> 33:28.000
Same over here!

33:28.000 --> 33:28.920
Same over here!

33:31.360 --> 33:33.600
Oh, come on, come on,
come on, come on!

33:41.720 --> 33:43.880
"I need to know
that there'll be no more lies.

33:44.720 --> 33:46.200
That you'd try to be a good man."

33:50.080 --> 33:51.240
Did you get that?

34:17.960 --> 34:21.840
What are we doing?
Nothing.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.000
We need to buy those call options
before the share prices
start to rebound.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.040
We need to buy those call options
before the share prices
start to rebound.

34:27.080 --> 34:29.720
Massimo needs to pick his moment.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.920
You're late.
Traffic.

34:47.880 --> 34:48.000
Just milk.
Thank you.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.520
Just milk.
Thank you.

34:59.960 --> 35:01.360
Shit!

35:01.400 --> 35:04.000
Buy more!
We can't!

35:04.000 --> 35:04.040
Buy more!
We can't!

35:04.080 --> 35:05.640
I said buy!
We can't!

35:06.720 --> 35:08.720
We've hit the cap
on foreign investment!

35:08.760 --> 35:11.400
British law says we can't
buy one more penny of NYL!

35:18.360 --> 35:19.360
Now?

35:22.520 --> 35:23.520
Now.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.120
All right, dump the CDS!

35:33.160 --> 35:34.240
Buy the call options!

35:40.680 --> 35:41.840
We're moving!

35:43.200 --> 35:44.000
At last!

35:44.000 --> 35:44.360
At last!

35:44.400 --> 35:46.040
Now for the hard part...

35:46.880 --> 35:48.440
Finally!

35:48.480 --> 35:50.640
Do you think we're back?
Let's hope.

36:06.480 --> 36:08.000
Holy shit, we're on fire!

36:08.000 --> 36:08.120
Holy shit, we're on fire!

36:10.440 --> 36:12.760
Come on... Come on!

36:17.280 --> 36:19.080
OK... Good... Come on, good...

36:28.480 --> 36:30.040
Yes, now we're talking!

36:30.080 --> 36:32.000
Take that, Massimo,
and shove it up your arse!

36:32.000 --> 36:33.040
Take that, Massimo,
and shove it up your arse!

36:39.760 --> 36:40.000
How high will it go?

36:40.000 --> 36:41.160
How high will it go?

36:41.200 --> 36:43.920
We need it to get to 50
and then keep going up.

36:43.960 --> 36:45.120
Fifty?
Mm-hm.

36:45.160 --> 36:47.120
Above 50 and we're in the clear.

36:51.760 --> 36:52.840
It's a bloody miracle!

36:53.920 --> 36:55.920
Massimo and Dominic
are behind this.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.160
What?

37:01.840 --> 37:04.000
See if anyone bought call options
at the bottom of the market.

37:04.000 --> 37:04.720
See if anyone bought call options
at the bottom of the market.

37:14.480 --> 37:15.480
Strike 50...

37:16.440 --> 37:17.680
Fifty?

37:18.440 --> 37:19.440
How soon?

37:19.480 --> 37:20.000
They have to be redeemed
in six hours.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.640
They have to be redeemed
in six hours.

37:22.680 --> 37:23.920
Six hours?!

37:23.960 --> 37:25.920
Massimo's out of his bloody mind!

37:25.960 --> 37:28.000
It is a crazy bet...
That's why he made it.

37:28.000 --> 37:28.600
It is a crazy bet...
That's why he made it.

37:28.640 --> 37:30.880
We were at Â£30 per share.

37:30.920 --> 37:33.920
The call price would have cost
practically nothing,

37:33.960 --> 37:35.920
especially in that timeframe.

37:39.960 --> 37:42.200
If the price keeps going up,
we'll lose the bank!

37:47.240 --> 37:48.240
Sell.

37:48.280 --> 37:49.280
Our own shares?

37:51.040 --> 37:52.000
You are joking...
Do it!

37:52.000 --> 37:52.520
You are joking...
Do it!

37:55.880 --> 37:57.680
All right, cancel the order, please!

37:57.720 --> 37:59.680
We're selling NYL
fast as we can, please!

37:59.720 --> 38:00.000
The lot!

38:00.000 --> 38:00.720
The lot!

38:00.760 --> 38:02.000
NYL?
NYL, yes, please.

38:09.640 --> 38:11.040
Now, will you look at that...

38:11.080 --> 38:12.400
NYL's dumping stock,

38:12.440 --> 38:15.080
but their share price
is still going up.

38:15.120 --> 38:16.000
I never thought it was possible.
Neither did I.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.520
I never thought it was possible.
Neither did I.

38:24.280 --> 38:25.920
Our share price is still going up!

38:25.960 --> 38:26.960
We can't stop it!

38:27.000 --> 38:29.080
Where the hell
did they get the bloody money?

38:29.120 --> 38:31.360
See where these purchases
are coming from.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.280
It's all... It's all small buyers.

38:39.520 --> 38:40.000
All over the world...
All at the same time.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.680
All over the world...
All at the same time.

38:43.800 --> 38:44.800
Shit...

38:59.600 --> 39:02.080
We're gonna lose the bank,
aren't we?

39:02.120 --> 39:03.920
I don't fuckin' believe it!

39:39.160 --> 39:42.240
Hmm!
I could kiss you...

39:42.280 --> 39:43.440
Maybe you should.

39:45.640 --> 39:48.200
Bang.
Bang.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.600
Yesterday,
after a wild day of trading,

39:58.640 --> 40:00.000
control of the New York London Bank
officially changed hands.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.040
control of the New York London Bank
officially changed hands.

40:03.080 --> 40:04.320
A historic day,

40:04.360 --> 40:08.000
not least as it represents
a huge setback
for the Chinese ambitions in Europe.

40:08.000 --> 40:08.440
not least as it represents
a huge setback
for the Chinese ambitions in Europe.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.640
You've had a busy few weeks,
haven't you?

40:25.800 --> 40:30.040
The evidence against Mr Ruggero
was obtained illegally

40:30.080 --> 40:32.000
and cannot be entered
into the record.

40:32.000 --> 40:32.240
and cannot be entered
into the record.

40:34.120 --> 40:38.360
How was New York?
Gratifying.

40:50.960 --> 40:52.600
Thank you all for being here.

40:55.360 --> 40:56.000
And London?

40:56.000 --> 40:56.680
And London?

40:58.040 --> 41:01.520
There have been some big changes...

41:02.400 --> 41:03.400
Thank you.

41:04.520 --> 41:07.240
Hey, guys, as CEO,

41:07.280 --> 41:09.920
I'd like to introduce
a familiar face

41:09.960 --> 41:12.000
as our new head of trading.

41:12.000 --> 41:12.680
as our new head of trading.

41:12.720 --> 41:15.120
Eleanor, welcome back to NYL.

41:15.160 --> 41:17.240
Thank you so much, guys.

41:17.280 --> 41:18.280
It's great to be back.

41:19.240 --> 41:20.000
You won... But are you safe?

41:20.000 --> 41:23.640
You won... But are you safe?

41:23.680 --> 41:25.080
I think so.

41:43.160 --> 41:44.000
Anton...

41:44.000 --> 41:44.160
Anton...

41:44.200 --> 41:45.200
Rebecca.

41:47.360 --> 41:49.840
My associates in Moscow
would like to speak to you.

42:29.640 --> 42:30.880
Congratulations.

42:32.920 --> 42:35.240
You're awfully gracious in defeat.

42:35.280 --> 42:37.240
I never wanted us to be enemies,

42:37.280 --> 42:39.280
but if our two countries must fight,

42:39.320 --> 42:40.000
sooner or later we will win.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.320
sooner or later we will win.

42:41.360 --> 42:43.600
I wouldn't count on that.

42:43.640 --> 42:46.040
While your country
drowns in debt and dysfunction,

42:46.080 --> 42:48.000
ours focuses on
innovation and success.

42:48.000 --> 42:48.560
ours focuses on
innovation and success.

42:48.600 --> 42:50.600
Suppressing the voices
of its own people.

42:50.640 --> 42:52.800
What are they afraid of, Liwei?

42:52.840 --> 42:55.480
Have you heard American voices?

42:55.520 --> 42:56.000
Obsessed with conspiracy theories,

42:56.000 --> 42:57.680
Obsessed with conspiracy theories,

42:57.720 --> 42:59.280
defending gun violence,

42:59.320 --> 43:02.480
refusing to acknowledge
an undeclared race war.

43:02.520 --> 43:04.000
We will heal our wounds
and come back stronger than ever.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.480
We will heal our wounds
and come back stronger than ever.

43:06.520 --> 43:07.920
We always do.

43:07.960 --> 43:09.120
I admire your faith...

43:10.880 --> 43:12.000
But I see little reason
to believe it.

43:12.000 --> 43:12.760
But I see little reason
to believe it.

43:22.400 --> 43:24.880
And you? Where will you go?

43:29.720 --> 43:31.120
I'm going home.

43:52.640 --> 43:54.720
Hey, I'm looking for Latoyah Harris.

43:55.920 --> 43:57.480
Would you follow me, please?

44:15.720 --> 44:16.000
Mister Harris, I'm so sorry...

44:16.000 --> 44:19.120
Mister Harris, I'm so sorry...

44:19.160 --> 44:22.040
It was very sudden.
There was nothing we could do.

44:22.080 --> 44:24.000
Her oxidation levels dropped.

44:24.000 --> 44:24.400
Her oxidation levels dropped.

44:24.440 --> 44:26.160
We tried to resuscitate, but...

44:31.360 --> 44:32.000
She passed away two hours ago.

44:32.000 --> 44:32.920
She passed away two hours ago.

44:33.840 --> 44:35.800
We're all just devastated.

44:35.840 --> 44:38.000
She's the third nurse
we've lost this week.

44:39.680 --> 44:40.000
May I call someone for you?

44:40.000 --> 44:41.640
May I call someone for you?

44:41.680 --> 44:42.680
What?

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
I'm so sorry...

44:49.440 --> 44:50.440
Huh?

47:41.800 --> 47:43.960
Now?
Have fun.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.960
make a big noise

47:47.800 --> 47:51.800
The democratisation
of access to financial stocks
through platforms,

47:51.840 --> 47:52.000
it's created sort of a perfect storm

47:52.000 --> 47:53.640
it's created sort of a perfect storm

47:53.680 --> 47:55.840
that's allowed
the power of the people

47:55.880 --> 47:58.200
to take on hedge funds
in the way that we've seen.

48:00.880 --> 48:04.840
Young investors are using
stimulus cheques
to help target hedge funds,

48:04.880 --> 48:07.200
upending traditional investors.

48:07.240 --> 48:08.000
It is the craziest
I think I've ever seen.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.320
It is the craziest
I think I've ever seen.

48:09.360 --> 48:11.760
Major banks
are facing billions in losses.

48:11.800 --> 48:13.440
They pick a stock,

48:13.480 --> 48:14.960
they tell each other 'hold',

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
'don't buy', when to buy...

48:16.000 --> 48:16.320
'don't buy', when to buy...

48:16.360 --> 48:18.160
Hold, hold, hold, HOLD!

48:20.120 --> 48:23.360
Wall Street was rocked today
by thousands of amateur
rogue traders

48:23.400 --> 48:24.000
from all over the world.

48:24.000 --> 48:24.560
from all over the world.

48:24.600 --> 48:25.600
Using social media,

48:25.640 --> 48:28.960
these young investors coordinated
the mass purchase of stocks

48:29.000 --> 48:30.800
in the so-called Bang companies,

48:30.840 --> 48:32.000
BlackBerry, AMC, Nokia and GameStop,

48:32.000 --> 48:33.560
BlackBerry, AMC, Nokia and GameStop,

48:33.600 --> 48:36.920
causing a trading frenzy
that led to stratospheric prices.

48:44.400 --> 48:46.560
GameStop,
we've got to talk about this today!

48:48.200 --> 48:51.080
Well, an army of invisible investors
is on the march

48:51.120 --> 48:54.120
and the world of finance
will NEVER be the same...
