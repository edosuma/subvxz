00:41.855 --> 00:43.617
Okay, what is going on?

00:46.345 --> 00:48.295
- What are you looking for?
- A lighter.

00:49.295 --> 00:50.128
Here.

00:55.835 --> 00:57.735
- Where are you going?
- Be right back.

01:25.855 --> 01:26.688
Jason?

01:32.092 --> 01:32.925
Jason?

02:04.380 --> 02:05.213
It's not real. It's not real.

03:08.475 --> 03:11.203
- Hey, Sarah.
- Did you find it?

03:11.205 --> 03:13.108
Here? It was under the couch.

03:14.545 --> 03:18.558
I probably kicked it over.
Oh, and this is for you.

03:19.865 --> 03:21.489
What is it?

03:22.324 --> 03:23.157
Oh, wait.

03:25.473 --> 03:29.083
It's my dad. I can't keep lying to him.

03:29.085 --> 03:31.393
Well, technically, you're not lying.

03:31.395 --> 03:33.883
I mean, this is a weekend getaway

03:33.885 --> 03:35.485
with your best friend, isn't it?

03:36.425 --> 03:37.318
I guess.

03:38.615 --> 03:40.363
But if anything happens to his house,

03:40.365 --> 03:41.473
he is going to kill me.

03:41.475 --> 03:45.818
Sarah, it's going to be fine. Finish it.

03:53.875 --> 03:55.513
And there's more where it came from.

03:55.515 --> 03:59.353
Mm-hmm. So is Matt on his way?

03:59.355 --> 04:02.278
Yes. By the way, he's
coming with his band.

04:03.655 --> 04:06.023
They just wrapped a show and
they were headed east anyway.

04:06.025 --> 04:07.888
What was I supposed to say, no?

04:09.515 --> 04:10.555
That's them.

04:12.245 --> 04:13.723
Potheads.

04:13.725 --> 04:14.613
Really?

04:14.615 --> 04:15.623
It's just a working title

04:15.625 --> 04:17.125
until they sign with an agent.

04:18.235 --> 04:21.168
- Wait, is that Alex?
- Who?

04:22.495 --> 04:24.403
The guy right in front.

04:24.405 --> 04:26.823
Oh, this photo's totally airbrushed.

04:26.825 --> 04:27.725
I'm sure it's not.

04:30.035 --> 04:31.185
Mr. Faithful.

04:37.855 --> 04:39.193
What's the big deal?

04:39.195 --> 04:41.753
You guys could have bumped
into each other in LA.

04:41.755 --> 04:44.183
Yes, in LA, but not in the middle

04:44.185 --> 04:46.483
of a native reservation at my dad's place.

04:46.485 --> 04:48.033
What did I miss?

04:48.035 --> 04:51.444
Alex is on his way with
Connie's new fuck boy.

04:51.446 --> 04:56.358
Wait, wait, wait.
Alex as in your ex?

05:05.195 --> 05:07.698
Okay, just play it cool. I got this.

05:08.755 --> 05:12.753
Well, I guess you were
right about one thing, Sarah.

05:12.755 --> 05:15.413
This weekend will be epic.

05:15.415 --> 05:16.841
Shut up.

05:18.255 --> 05:20.173
Hey, that was mine.

05:20.175 --> 05:21.834
- Bitch.
- Whore.

05:26.875 --> 05:29.223
Oh, GPS system lost. We're here.

05:29.225 --> 05:32.507
You sure this is the right house?

05:35.255 --> 05:36.908
Yep, that's the one.

05:38.545 --> 05:43.545
Hey, guys. How was the ride?

05:44.185 --> 05:45.016
Long.

05:45.018 --> 05:46.983
If I knew reservation
didn't have street names,

05:46.985 --> 05:48.863
I'd have had Alex bring his hipster map.

05:48.865 --> 05:50.633
Oh, fuck off.

05:50.635 --> 05:53.403
That map saved our ass
when we got lost in Vegas.

05:53.405 --> 05:55.683
Dude, you're the reason
we got lost in Vegas.

05:55.685 --> 05:56.693
Hey, hey, hey.

05:56.695 --> 06:00.388
Crap. No bars? What am I
supposed to do for the next hour?

06:01.785 --> 06:04.703
Just chill. Check out the house.

06:04.705 --> 06:07.590
You're right. I should
totally story this.

06:13.175 --> 06:14.638
So how do you pronounce it?

06:15.535 --> 06:16.773
Nick Young.

06:16.775 --> 06:20.793
Nick Young.
You've got a rock star name.

06:20.795 --> 06:22.060
Hell yeah I do.

06:40.295 --> 06:42.190
You miss me?

06:42.192 --> 06:43.025
Nope.

06:55.695 --> 06:56.808
You asshole!

06:58.575 --> 07:00.125
It's gonna rain later anyway.

07:02.885 --> 07:03.718
Fuck you.

07:14.185 --> 07:17.173
And back to my loser
brother and this awesome view.

07:17.175 --> 07:18.238
Quite a clash.

07:20.796 --> 07:23.468
So which one of you lives here anyways?

07:24.725 --> 07:26.528
No one. It's my dad's property.

07:27.605 --> 07:29.383
- Nice.
- Thanks.

07:29.385 --> 07:31.863
Yeah, but we're going to
have to keep it clean, though,

07:31.865 --> 07:33.853
because her dad rented the place out,

07:33.855 --> 07:35.763
and the people move in next week.

07:35.765 --> 07:37.413
Oh, well, perfect.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.765
Brought some glitter
bomb. Should I go get 'em?

07:41.075 --> 07:43.308
- Oh, he's kidding, Sarah.
- Mm-hmm.

07:45.345 --> 07:47.263
I'm obsessed with this fireplace.

07:47.265 --> 07:49.683
It looks just like that
house in Beverly Hills

07:49.685 --> 07:52.123
where you guys had that party, remember?

07:52.125 --> 07:55.441
The time I walked in and you blond girl?

07:56.276 --> 07:59.013
It's cool. She's been on tour with us.

07:59.015 --> 08:01.383
She's seen it all, the parties-

08:01.385 --> 08:04.794
- And the baddest band in
LA rocking their faces off.

08:10.607 --> 08:11.733
Ow!

08:11.735 --> 08:13.298
It's not gonna rain, asshole.

08:14.225 --> 08:15.825
I'm sorry. Don't be mad at me.

08:20.945 --> 08:22.348
Okay, what is this?

08:23.225 --> 08:25.833
This is the proper way to drink tequila.

08:25.835 --> 08:28.143
Oh no. Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

08:28.145 --> 08:31.688
Don't be a pussy.
One shot, don't sip it.

08:33.765 --> 08:35.347
Sarah, you, too.

08:37.875 --> 08:41.087
Here's to our epic weekend,
one Sarah won't forget.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.600
Thanks, babe. That was terrible.

08:50.602 --> 08:53.213
That tastes like jalapeno and dog's ass.

08:53.215 --> 08:54.212
Gross.

08:55.846 --> 08:56.888
Oh.

08:56.890 --> 09:00.438
- Oh my God, are you okay?
- Sorry. This is your fault.

09:03.265 --> 09:04.515
Everything is my fault.

09:06.145 --> 09:07.510
Anyone want this?

09:07.512 --> 09:08.948
- No.
- Yeah, where's Alex?

09:12.615 --> 09:15.578
Ooh, what are you wearing?

09:16.761 --> 09:19.223
Sorry, gotta go. Thanks.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.258
Hey, Sarah.

09:21.425 --> 09:22.258
Hey.

09:25.015 --> 09:28.173
I'm sorry. I had no
reception on my cell phone.

09:28.175 --> 09:29.703
I had to make a quick phone call.

09:29.705 --> 09:30.538
It's all good.

09:31.425 --> 09:33.888
So what happened there?

09:35.245 --> 09:37.253
- Connie
- Of course.

09:37.255 --> 09:38.088
Yep.

09:40.895 --> 09:45.895
So you're in a band
now. Must be pretty busy.

09:47.615 --> 09:51.163
We are. Started in a basement.

09:51.165 --> 09:53.083
Now we're on tour.

09:53.085 --> 09:57.148
I mean, it's a lot with
school and all, but we manage.

09:58.845 --> 09:59.678
Good for you.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.008
I'll let you change.

10:17.225 --> 10:18.158
Happy birthday.

10:45.679 --> 10:46.596
Oh, shit.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.483
Oh, hey, look, who's here.

11:01.485 --> 11:03.418
- What's up, Hollywood?
- Hey guys.

11:04.353 --> 11:05.853
Good to see you two.

11:05.855 --> 11:07.203
Nice car.

11:07.205 --> 11:10.063
It's my birthday gift from Dad.

11:10.065 --> 11:10.948
Of course.

11:11.855 --> 11:13.223
We were just checking in on the house,

11:13.225 --> 11:14.663
and we can see you called first dibs.

11:14.665 --> 11:16.413
So we were just gonna...

11:16.415 --> 11:17.813
Yeah, is that like your thing now?

11:17.815 --> 11:19.393
You just hang out on the reservation?

11:19.395 --> 11:24.395
No. We're just spending
the night, I mean my friends.

11:24.935 --> 11:27.908
Drove all the way from
LA just to stay the night?

11:29.135 --> 11:30.148
Come on. Let's go.

11:32.765 --> 11:33.598
Wait.

11:36.065 --> 11:37.868
Do you guys want a beer?

11:44.896 --> 11:45.729
One drink.

12:01.672 --> 12:05.348
Guys, get in. It's on timer.

12:06.674 --> 12:08.924
- What's up, bitches?
- Woo!

12:16.815 --> 12:18.802
Wait, are those my edibles?

12:22.628 --> 12:25.723
I don't know. I
found 'em on the counter.

12:34.655 --> 12:36.383
Jacey looks kind of cute.

12:36.385 --> 12:39.173
- Connie, no.
- What?

12:39.175 --> 12:41.593
He's your stepbrother. What
are you gonna do with him?

12:41.595 --> 12:43.133
I only invited them in to be nice

12:43.135 --> 12:44.533
so they don't narc to my dad.

12:44.535 --> 12:46.893
So please, don't do anything stupid.

12:46.895 --> 12:49.013
We're gonna have a sick party,

12:49.015 --> 12:49.963
and I'm gonna make sure

12:49.965 --> 12:51.678
that Jacey and Tala don't ruin it.

13:02.756 --> 13:04.720
- Here, babe.
- Hey, thanks.

13:09.443 --> 13:11.615
- Oh, here.
- I don't drink beer.

13:12.518 --> 13:13.851
Okay.

13:15.055 --> 13:17.463
So we're at this
party and guess who walks in?

13:17.465 --> 13:19.718
- Oh my God, who?
- Tom fuckin' DeLonge.

13:22.495 --> 13:24.053
Oh, come on, guys!

13:24.055 --> 13:26.223
He is the man behind Blink-182.

13:26.225 --> 13:29.233
- Oh.
- Anyway,

13:29.235 --> 13:32.673
so we light up a joint, and
he tells us this crazy story

13:32.675 --> 13:35.033
about when they got lost on the road.

13:35.035 --> 13:37.653
Ended up outside Albuquerque

13:37.655 --> 13:40.118
in a reservation just like this one.

13:40.965 --> 13:41.928
No offense, Jacob.

13:42.765 --> 13:44.913
- Jacey.
- Oh, my bad.

13:44.915 --> 13:49.908
So anyway, tank ran out of gas and shit.

13:50.939 --> 13:51.772
And?

13:53.887 --> 13:56.533
And nothing. He couldn't remember.

13:56.535 --> 13:58.329
He was too fucked up.

13:58.331 --> 14:00.543
Idiot.

14:00.545 --> 14:05.083
Okay, this is officially
the worst campfire story ever.

14:05.085 --> 14:07.023
- Ooh.
- Wait.

14:07.025 --> 14:09.293
- I've got a better one.
- Oh, here we go.

14:09.295 --> 14:12.163
It's not a story. It's a game.

14:12.165 --> 14:12.998
Let me see.

14:14.415 --> 14:16.713
I got it from a
gas station off the road.

14:16.715 --> 14:18.293
Oh, you guys stopped at Midnight's?

14:18.295 --> 14:21.233
Yeah, is that like the name
of the owner or something?

14:21.235 --> 14:23.413
Yeah, like the first hour of the day.

14:23.415 --> 14:25.523
- Slaughtered villagers.
- What?

14:25.525 --> 14:29.133
- A day begins at midnight.
- Sheriff, wow,

14:29.135 --> 14:29.968
werewolves.

14:30.925 --> 14:32.633
Oh, okay guys. I know this one.

14:32.635 --> 14:35.253
It's like a Mafia Wars,
but instead of the mob,

14:35.255 --> 14:37.183
we have to lynch the werewolves.

14:37.185 --> 14:39.723
Pretty basic rules.
Kind of like whodunnit.

14:39.725 --> 14:41.613
- Exactly.
- Lynched?

14:41.615 --> 14:45.223
I'll lead the game and
explain the rules as we go.

14:45.225 --> 14:47.333
Sounds fun. Should be interesting.

14:47.335 --> 14:48.993
Matt.

14:48.995 --> 14:50.013
Matt, give me the cards.

14:50.015 --> 14:52.856
It's too late, man. I got this.

14:52.858 --> 14:56.785
- What are you doing, man?
- Sorry about that, brother.

14:59.394 --> 15:00.225
Hey.

15:01.735 --> 15:05.148
Thanks, man. Stealing
the show as always.

15:08.395 --> 15:10.583
- Keep your card a secret.
- No, I'm good.

15:10.585 --> 15:12.783
I'll just, you know,
watch. You guys can play.

15:12.785 --> 15:15.263
Oh, come on. Just one round?

15:15.265 --> 15:16.815
Then we can go for a booze run.

15:18.235 --> 15:21.608
There's a new sheriff in
town. Shit's about to get real.

15:22.835 --> 15:24.953
Do you even know how to play?

15:24.955 --> 15:28.750
I'll just wing it. Sheriff's got brains.

15:30.636 --> 15:32.028
Bullshit.

15:32.880 --> 15:36.648
Okay, it's nighttime.

15:37.995 --> 15:40.960
The village is asleep.

15:42.215 --> 15:44.838
Close your eyes and don't peek.

15:46.795 --> 15:51.795
You're all passed out
except for the werewolves.

15:54.525 --> 15:58.413
Werewolves. Open your eyes.

15:58.415 --> 16:01.593
Look at one another, but keep quiet.

16:01.595 --> 16:02.763
Now which one of these fucks do you

16:02.765 --> 16:04.565
wanna put out of their misery first?

16:08.355 --> 16:12.523
Okay, close your eyes. All right now.

16:12.525 --> 16:16.543
One of you is the witch,
and you have a spell

16:16.545 --> 16:18.438
that can either heal or kill.

16:19.585 --> 16:21.843
But you can only use it
once during the game,

16:21.845 --> 16:26.788
so, bitch, I mean witch, where you at?

16:30.125 --> 16:32.663
Do you wanna use your
spell to save this person

16:32.665 --> 16:33.498
or let 'em die?

16:35.995 --> 16:38.643
All right. So it's the morning after.

16:38.645 --> 16:40.137
Asses up, everyone.

16:46.605 --> 16:49.276
Julia, you're dead.

16:49.278 --> 16:51.213
What?

16:51.215 --> 16:53.403
And before you start pointing fingers,

16:53.405 --> 16:55.673
just know I call the shots.

16:55.675 --> 17:00.675
You guys debate. So who's the werewolf?

17:00.825 --> 17:03.888
Liz, it's you, isn't it?

17:03.890 --> 17:08.888
What? Hey, you're throwing
me under the bus awfully quick.

17:10.128 --> 17:12.738
See, you guys? She's just deflecting.

17:13.704 --> 17:16.742
Connie, deflecting? Unlikely.

17:16.743 --> 17:18.914
We all know she's an attention whore.

17:19.925 --> 17:23.781
Attention whore, huh? Well,
at least I'm not a cannibal.

17:23.784 --> 17:27.136
She's right. You'd have to
be human to be a cannibal.

17:27.137 --> 17:29.704
Oh ho ho ho!

17:29.706 --> 17:30.893
Touche, man.

17:30.895 --> 17:32.423
I think this is all a distraction

17:32.425 --> 17:36.048
to hide the real werewolf, right, Alex?

17:37.042 --> 17:38.203
Is Connie protecting you?

17:38.205 --> 17:42.053
Why? Why not accuse me if
she knew I was the werewolf?

17:42.055 --> 17:46.068
I don't know. Maybe
you to work as a team.

17:46.955 --> 17:48.803
I vote Alex.

17:48.805 --> 17:51.520
He knows the game, and I'm
sure he's playing nice.

17:51.522 --> 17:53.393
This is my
first time playing just

17:53.395 --> 17:56.643
like all of you guys, but whatever.

17:56.645 --> 17:59.348
Anyone else for Alex? Show of hands.

18:00.725 --> 18:01.558
Liz?

18:04.011 --> 18:07.735
Alex, you've been
lynched. Reveal your card, man.

18:10.615 --> 18:13.273
I told you. I told you it wasn't me.

18:13.275 --> 18:14.108
Ooh.

18:15.325 --> 18:17.362
You're not in the bad guy after all.

18:18.435 --> 18:20.658
- I never was.
- Dork.

18:21.837 --> 18:22.710
Oh my God.

18:22.712 --> 18:27.003
All right, all right. Alex is out.

18:27.005 --> 18:28.738
Everyone back to sleep.

18:31.325 --> 18:35.728
Werewolves, point out your next victim.

19:01.827 --> 19:02.660
Connie?

19:26.741 --> 19:30.853
Oh, shit. I feel like
I was hit by a truck.

19:30.855 --> 19:33.532
What happened? Where's everybody?

19:35.755 --> 19:39.295
Oh God. Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up.

19:40.626 --> 19:43.459
Okay. Let me get you some water.

20:46.518 --> 20:51.173
Fuck. We're still here?

20:51.175 --> 20:52.238
What time is it?

20:54.075 --> 20:58.423
Almost two. How long was I out?

20:58.425 --> 21:02.598
I don't know. But
you had a fuck load of shots.

21:03.855 --> 21:07.418
You should drink this.
You should lie down.

21:08.540 --> 21:09.913
Mm-mm.

21:09.915 --> 21:12.928
When I lie down, I feel like
the whole room is moving.

21:17.785 --> 21:20.988
- Where's Matt?
- Oh, your boy? He's gone.

21:21.855 --> 21:22.686
He went out to pee

21:22.688 --> 21:25.228
and then he kept walking towards the lake.

21:27.425 --> 21:31.108
Can you guys please stop shouting?

21:42.765 --> 21:44.215
You look like hell.

21:51.345 --> 21:56.345
Has anyone seen Julia?
She's not answering her phone.

21:57.265 --> 21:58.565
Maybe your phone's dead.

22:12.295 --> 22:13.128
Alex.

22:14.555 --> 22:16.268
Hey, Alex.

22:17.161 --> 22:19.984
- Where are we?
- Have you seen Julia?

22:19.986 --> 22:21.848
- That shit is strong.
- Dude!

22:22.921 --> 22:25.271
I don't know, man. When
did you see her last?

22:28.506 --> 22:29.339
Well?

22:31.930 --> 22:33.173
Hey, wait for me!

22:33.175 --> 22:35.023
Just going to the gas
station for a booze run.

22:35.025 --> 22:36.803
I know, but the gas
station is the only place

22:36.805 --> 22:37.958
where my hotspot works.

22:40.045 --> 22:41.145
I need pics for Insta.

22:46.055 --> 22:49.472
Guys, get in! We're on a timer!

23:05.228 --> 23:07.893
Liz, do you remember what
that store we went to was?

23:07.895 --> 23:10.888
Fuck my life.

23:18.625 --> 23:19.873
All right, Alex. I got the address.

23:19.875 --> 23:22.353
Does your phone get Wi-fi?
My Waze isn't working.

23:22.355 --> 23:23.186
My phone's dead.

23:23.188 --> 23:28.033
It's at the street after that building.

23:28.035 --> 23:28.885
Which building?

23:32.092 --> 23:33.095
Shit!

23:38.426 --> 23:39.259
Let's go.

23:49.785 --> 23:51.535
Wait! I think we passed our turn.

24:08.945 --> 24:09.778
Fuck!

24:10.751 --> 24:14.743
I would totally munch
on some cookies right now.

24:14.745 --> 24:16.833
I got some tortilla
chips in the van if you-

24:16.835 --> 24:20.168
- Guys! Can we please focus?

24:21.085 --> 24:22.653
Look, Liz, do you remember anything?

24:22.655 --> 24:24.392
Did Julia say anything to you?

24:25.295 --> 24:26.573
Yeah.

24:26.575 --> 24:28.553
She said she hates being on the road

24:28.555 --> 24:31.213
with you and your stupid band.

24:31.215 --> 24:33.283
Maybe she ran away.

24:33.285 --> 24:34.153
No offense, man,

24:34.155 --> 24:36.463
but you shouldn't have
let her out of your sight.

24:36.465 --> 24:38.708
You know what, Alex? Fuck off!

24:39.971 --> 24:41.453
Look, I'm sure she's fine.

24:41.455 --> 24:43.643
She's probably passed out
at the house somewhere.

24:47.505 --> 24:49.573
- Well, I checked every room
- Guys!

24:49.575 --> 24:50.408
twice.

24:52.085 --> 24:53.868
Guys, isn't this Julia's phone?

25:05.739 --> 25:09.739
Yeah, this is hers.
Four missed calls from me.

25:11.885 --> 25:13.868
- There's nothing in here.
- Can I see?

25:23.405 --> 25:26.453
Guys, I think we should get going.

25:26.455 --> 25:27.905
I don't think it's safe here.

25:29.385 --> 25:31.623
I'm not leaving without her.

25:31.625 --> 25:34.893
Well, we'll report this to
the police. I'll go with you.

25:34.895 --> 25:38.663
I'm not leaving without
her, and I'm staying here.

25:38.665 --> 25:40.173
I'm gonna look around some more.

25:40.175 --> 25:41.083
We looked around,

25:41.085 --> 25:42.233
and all we found was her cell phone.

25:42.235 --> 25:43.123
- Exactly!
- Julia!

25:43.125 --> 25:45.363
Which means
she could still be here.

25:45.365 --> 25:48.903
- Where could she possibly be?
- Julia!

25:48.905 --> 25:51.855
Dude, she probably
just dropped it the first time.

25:55.785 --> 25:56.618
Julia!

26:00.235 --> 26:01.068
Julia!

26:03.548 --> 26:05.542
Julia!

26:08.810 --> 26:09.822
Julia?

26:15.779 --> 26:20.779
Guys, you need to come see this!

26:21.477 --> 26:23.159
Where'd she go?

26:26.620 --> 26:27.703
Liz!

26:28.684 --> 26:29.859
Liz!

27:40.548 --> 27:41.548
- Liz!
- Liz!

27:43.298 --> 27:45.117
Liz, where are you?

27:45.119 --> 27:45.952
Liz!

27:47.705 --> 27:48.538
Liz!

28:01.351 --> 28:02.182
Where is she?

28:02.184 --> 28:03.910
- I don't know.
- Alex.

28:03.912 --> 28:04.912
- Liz!
- Liz!

28:05.908 --> 28:07.325
- Liz! Liz!
- Liz!

28:09.706 --> 28:10.829
Liz!

28:12.383 --> 28:13.383
- Liz!
- Liz!

28:27.703 --> 28:28.536
Here.

28:30.828 --> 28:32.745
- Thanks.
- No worries.

28:35.285 --> 28:38.203
I mean, you know, thanks for being cool

28:38.205 --> 28:41.958
about the house and everything.

28:43.165 --> 28:45.915
You guys can crash here if
you want until you sober up.

28:46.955 --> 28:49.723
Yo, whatever, I drive
better when I'm drunk, so.

28:49.725 --> 28:51.336
Jace!

28:51.338 --> 28:53.323
What? It's better.

28:53.325 --> 28:55.463
- No fun.
- Oh my God.

28:55.465 --> 28:57.923
Okay, we both know that Dad

28:57.925 --> 29:00.963
would not want us to party at this house.

29:00.965 --> 29:02.925
He'd kill us.

29:04.629 --> 29:07.365
Okay, so are we cool?

29:10.035 --> 29:12.775
Yeah, you're off the hook.

29:15.613 --> 29:16.444
- Oh, shit!
- Shit!

29:16.446 --> 29:17.873
What just happened?

29:17.875 --> 29:20.153
Flipped the breaker.
Flipped the breaker, no worries.

29:20.155 --> 29:21.613
It happens all the time.

29:21.615 --> 29:23.765
Well, do we
have any flashlights?

29:26.995 --> 29:28.225
Yup. All right.

29:29.495 --> 29:30.328
I got this.

29:32.295 --> 29:34.180
Watch out for the ghost.

29:35.164 --> 29:36.078
Shut up, Jace.

30:00.725 --> 30:01.558
Sarah!

30:03.555 --> 30:04.955
Sarah, is the power back on?

30:06.105 --> 30:07.638
No, still out.

30:09.802 --> 30:11.302
Which one is it?

30:18.621 --> 30:19.454
Shit!

30:29.380 --> 30:34.380
Hello?

30:36.745 --> 30:38.330
Hello?

30:50.989 --> 30:53.491
Tala, the lights are back!

31:04.441 --> 31:05.873
Are you all right?

31:05.875 --> 31:07.098
I heard something.

31:08.335 --> 31:11.353
- Like what?
- I don't know.

31:11.355 --> 31:12.913
I don't know, but it was growling.

31:12.915 --> 31:15.406
It was growling like a fucking wolf.

31:25.115 --> 31:28.342
I'm sure it's
nothing. We'll check it out.

32:30.635 --> 32:32.091
There's nobody down there.

32:40.285 --> 32:43.108
Honey, it's called a hangover terror.

32:46.635 --> 32:47.808
I know what I saw.

32:54.045 --> 32:54.878
Guys.

32:57.665 --> 32:58.498
Where is Liz?

33:02.205 --> 33:03.058
She ran off.

33:07.313 --> 33:10.723
Is there anywhere in this goddamn shack

33:10.725 --> 33:13.073
that gets reception?

33:13.075 --> 33:14.763
We're in the middle of
the goddamn woods, man.

33:14.765 --> 33:16.463
What do you expect?

33:16.465 --> 33:17.462
I got one bar.

33:20.080 --> 33:24.073
Thank you, Alex. That
was very fucking useful!

33:24.075 --> 33:27.463
Hey look. Have you tried the
phone in the master bedroom?

33:27.465 --> 33:30.713
How could you lose her? You
were right there with her.

33:30.715 --> 33:33.983
It was pitch black
outside. I couldn't see shit.

33:33.985 --> 33:36.608
So she disappeared?

33:38.465 --> 33:39.943
Yes.

33:39.945 --> 33:43.033
Okay, it sounds ridiculous
when you say it out loud,

33:43.035 --> 33:47.233
but I swear I'm not making this up.

33:47.235 --> 33:51.263
I found this on the street
right after Liz disappeared,

33:51.265 --> 33:53.118
and this one was on Julia's phone.

33:56.505 --> 33:58.873
Aren't these the cards from your game?

33:58.875 --> 34:00.423
Check her phone.

34:00.425 --> 34:02.503
She took some selfies
and right behind her,

34:02.505 --> 34:04.408
you can see a pair of eyes like,

34:07.410 --> 34:10.077
like not human eyes.

34:11.975 --> 34:16.975
Phone's dead. How
convenient, and where's Matt?

34:17.143 --> 34:20.473
Is he also missing?

34:20.475 --> 34:21.947
I thought he was with you.

34:24.003 --> 34:28.112
So you think
I'm fucking with you.

34:28.114 --> 34:31.246
Well, whatever this
is, it needs to stop.

34:33.534 --> 34:35.777
I'm too old to play hide and seek.

34:44.725 --> 34:46.453
What'd they say?

34:46.455 --> 34:48.723
Called a bunch of numbers
and nobody's answering.

34:48.725 --> 34:50.175
Police stations are closed.

34:51.063 --> 34:53.072
- I'm going down there.
- And do what?

34:53.074 --> 34:54.873
I'll be right back. Come on, Alex.

34:56.405 --> 34:58.818
I swear I'm telling the truth.

35:21.935 --> 35:23.988
Oh, look. Tonight's the blue moon.

35:25.486 --> 35:27.463
- Ah!
- Might be a lucky one.

35:27.465 --> 35:28.823
- Blue moon?
- Yeah.

35:28.825 --> 35:31.763
So when there's two full
moons in the same cycle,

35:31.765 --> 35:33.143
the second one's called the blue moon

35:33.145 --> 35:34.986
because it's a rare phenomenon.

35:34.988 --> 35:37.473
Oh, is that
like a native thing?

35:37.475 --> 35:39.488
No, it's a smart people thing.

35:45.545 --> 35:46.908
What?

35:46.910 --> 35:50.410
We were finally vibing. Thanks for that.

36:02.765 --> 36:04.065
Sorry about your friend.

36:05.315 --> 36:07.393
Look, I know we're not close or anything,

36:07.395 --> 36:11.238
but if you need my help, I can stay.

36:12.345 --> 36:13.178
Thanks.

36:18.065 --> 36:23.065
You know, you probably
think that I don't get you,

36:25.025 --> 36:27.498
- but I do.
- No, you don't.

36:28.398 --> 36:29.598
I get why you hate me.

36:33.065 --> 36:36.348
Dad wasn't around much.
Now he's with my mom.

36:38.145 --> 36:42.518
It's not your fault.
I mean, it's not you.

36:45.605 --> 36:46.913
It's just that we didn't grow up

36:46.915 --> 36:50.463
with the big house and fancy cars.

36:50.465 --> 36:52.738
Family was all that we had.

36:58.025 --> 37:01.658
And maybe in some twisted
alternate universe,

37:03.115 --> 37:07.228
we could be friends or sisters.

37:11.785 --> 37:16.668
LA is only a drive away. You
can come visit if you want.

37:18.575 --> 37:20.428
You think your mom
would be okay with that?

37:21.316 --> 37:25.928
No, but she'll come around.

37:34.155 --> 37:35.528
- Sarah.
- Yeah.

37:36.455 --> 37:38.503
You took pictures
at the campfire, right?

37:38.505 --> 37:41.048
- Yeah.
- Can I see them?

37:46.048 --> 37:46.881
Thank you.

37:49.845 --> 37:54.263
So this was Julia's card
during the game, the townsfolk.

37:54.265 --> 37:55.838
This could be anybody's card.

37:57.695 --> 37:59.473
Julia and Liz were the first

37:59.475 --> 38:02.275
to be killed by the werewolves,
and now they're missing?

38:03.665 --> 38:07.263
So? Someone's messing with us.

38:07.265 --> 38:08.643
Playing the game all over.

38:08.645 --> 38:11.533
Maybe Liz and Julia are playing hooky.

38:11.535 --> 38:13.723
Well, whoever it is,
surely wasn't in the basement

38:13.725 --> 38:15.703
when Tala heard that growling.

38:15.705 --> 38:16.538
Maybe.

38:20.565 --> 38:21.703
Wait.

38:21.705 --> 38:25.128
Sarah was the third one killed
by the werewolves, not me.

38:26.445 --> 38:29.518
Werewolves, who's next?

38:31.515 --> 38:33.808
Hey! Keep your eyes closed.

38:36.405 --> 38:38.538
Wolves, point out your next victim.

38:41.285 --> 38:45.613
Done. Witch, wake up.

38:45.615 --> 38:47.565
This person is about to be slaughtered.

38:48.855 --> 38:51.948
Will you save 'em or let 'em die?

38:54.605 --> 38:56.333
Good news!

38:56.335 --> 38:58.433
The witch used her spell
to save tonight's victim,

38:58.435 --> 39:00.898
so it looks like all
of you dodged a bullet.

39:02.375 --> 39:05.193
Oh, and just FYI.

39:05.195 --> 39:09.243
We have a stray cat who's
the only person allowed

39:09.245 --> 39:13.563
to peek during the game,
so watch out, werewolves.

39:13.565 --> 39:15.765
Keep your eyes closed.
We're still at night.

39:17.385 --> 39:18.828
Wolves, who's next?

39:22.925 --> 39:25.563
You saved yourself with the spell

39:25.565 --> 39:27.065
when the werewolves chose you.

39:28.035 --> 39:29.713
I know because I was peeking.

39:29.715 --> 39:33.733
So you were the witch
and Tala the stray cat.

39:33.735 --> 39:37.483
Okay. What are you getting at?

39:37.485 --> 39:38.433
She was allowed to peek

39:38.435 --> 39:40.683
when the werewolf chose their victims.

39:40.685 --> 39:43.564
So whatever you saw in the base-

39:43.566 --> 39:45.423
- Heard.

39:45.425 --> 39:49.771
Heard in the basement wasn't after you.

39:53.649 --> 39:54.599
It was after Sarah.

39:57.045 --> 39:59.288
Okay. Back up for a minute.

40:00.171 --> 40:02.171
Are you really saying the game is alive?

40:03.215 --> 40:05.763
Normally, I would say
that he's still drunk.

40:05.765 --> 40:06.603
He is.

40:06.605 --> 40:08.859
But I think he's onto something.

40:08.861 --> 40:12.608
Okay. You guys
are cut off for the night.

40:13.525 --> 40:16.193
No more whatever you're on.

40:16.195 --> 40:18.009
Connie, wait.

40:21.285 --> 40:24.243
Look, I know that they
sound a little crazy,

40:24.245 --> 40:26.623
but just give 'em a chance.

40:26.625 --> 40:27.458
For what?

40:29.155 --> 40:32.663
They know this place, and
they can help figure this out.

40:32.665 --> 40:34.653
Oh, is that what that was?

40:34.655 --> 40:36.683
- Look, I-
- No, it's fine.

40:36.685 --> 40:40.043
You stay. I'm gonna go find Matt.

40:40.045 --> 40:40.968
In the forest.

40:42.128 --> 40:43.728
He couldn't have gone too far.

40:44.775 --> 40:47.563
Are you sure you can trust him?

40:47.565 --> 40:50.873
He may be an asshole with
a very bad sense of humor,

40:50.875 --> 40:53.443
but after three months,
I think I would know he's

40:53.445 --> 40:56.953
not a psychopath or a murderer.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.594
Wait, what?

41:01.105 --> 41:04.213
You've known Matt for three months.

41:04.215 --> 41:05.228
Yeah?

41:06.475 --> 41:09.243
So you've been around
Alex this whole time,

41:09.245 --> 41:10.488
and you didn't tell me?

41:11.675 --> 41:13.123
It wasn't like that.

41:13.125 --> 41:16.238
I bumped into Alex at a party
and he introduced me to Matt.

41:17.495 --> 41:18.873
Poor thing.

41:18.875 --> 41:22.073
You were ghosting him
hard, so I invited him here

41:22.075 --> 41:24.703
so you guys could have a chance to talk.

41:24.705 --> 41:27.733
I was ghosting him
because I broke up with him.

41:27.735 --> 41:29.643
And you told me you saw him with a girl.

41:29.645 --> 41:30.858
Who cares what I said?

41:31.695 --> 41:35.468
You guys were broken up and you
kept stalking his Instagram.

41:35.470 --> 41:37.643
I was just trying to
help you get over him.

41:37.645 --> 41:40.932
Wow. I trusted you.

41:44.111 --> 41:44.944
You know,

41:47.355 --> 41:49.747
you should just leave with
the guys in the morning.

41:49.749 --> 41:54.520
Okay, yeah.
Have fun with your weirdos.

42:23.907 --> 42:24.740
Okay.

43:26.835 --> 43:27.838
Nice try.

43:30.565 --> 43:31.608
You got jokes.

43:39.926 --> 43:41.443
Okay.

43:50.445 --> 43:52.008
What the fuck do you want?

43:55.425 --> 43:56.258
Shit.

44:40.275 --> 44:42.188
Jesus fucking Christ.

45:25.875 --> 45:27.813
- Just keep going straight.
- Where's our next turn?

45:27.815 --> 45:29.915
I don't know. It keeps rerouting.

45:32.115 --> 45:32.946
Fuck!

45:32.948 --> 45:34.603
Why the hell are you stopping?

45:34.605 --> 45:36.423
To not use up my gas!

45:36.425 --> 45:37.623
Not trying to get stuck out

45:37.625 --> 45:38.843
in the middle of fucking nowhere.

45:38.845 --> 45:40.908
- I think we passed it.
- Shit!

45:42.655 --> 45:45.798
There's some lights.
We're getting close to town.

45:52.015 --> 45:55.368
- Got a signal yet?
- Nope, no signal.

46:00.785 --> 46:02.468
Just light a candle.

46:03.525 --> 46:05.563
Hey. What's up with this dude?

46:05.565 --> 46:07.773
How do you know it's a dude?

46:07.775 --> 46:09.483
Well, middle of the night.

46:09.485 --> 46:11.423
It's either an old dude or a hot chick,

46:11.425 --> 46:13.075
and have you seen my luck lately?

46:15.325 --> 46:16.706
Hey, are you sure you wanna do this?

46:16.708 --> 46:18.754
I got this.

46:25.075 --> 46:26.628
Hey. Excuse me, sir.

46:27.695 --> 46:28.563
Hey there.

46:28.565 --> 46:30.523
A bit late for a walk, don't you think?

46:30.525 --> 46:32.463
Not for me. This is early.

46:32.465 --> 46:35.319
- I'm on my way to work.
- Really?

46:36.585 --> 46:39.317
I've been walking
this road for 30 years.

46:40.152 --> 46:42.135
How do you think I stay
in such great shape?

46:43.025 --> 46:44.373
I'm Nick, by the way.

46:44.375 --> 46:47.343
- Midnight.
- No shit, Midnight.

46:47.345 --> 46:49.293
Hey, Alex! It's Midnight!

46:49.295 --> 46:51.650
We were at your gas station earlier.

46:51.652 --> 46:53.193
Right, it's straight ahead.

46:53.195 --> 46:57.963
Yeah, actually, we are
looking for our friends.

46:57.965 --> 47:00.138
You haven't seen 'em by
any chance, have you?

47:05.745 --> 47:07.983
No, sorry. They don't look familiar.

47:07.985 --> 47:09.920
Do you know where we
could find a police station?

47:09.922 --> 47:12.253
Not at this time of day.

47:12.255 --> 47:14.323
There's a sheriff's office

47:14.325 --> 47:15.158
with I think a night agent on duty.

47:18.005 --> 47:19.603
Would you like me to show you where it is?

47:19.605 --> 47:21.473
That would be amazing. Thank you.

47:21.475 --> 47:22.975
Hop in. We'll give you a ride.

47:37.705 --> 47:38.538
Shit!

47:40.935 --> 47:43.124
You okay, Alex?

47:43.126 --> 47:46.672
Shit. Your head is
, you're a wolf.

47:49.285 --> 47:50.118
What?

48:13.025 --> 48:14.753
Good news!

48:14.755 --> 48:16.853
The witch used her spell
to save tonight's victim,

48:16.855 --> 48:19.308
so it looks like all
of you dodged a bullet.

48:20.605 --> 48:22.048
Wolves, who's next?

48:24.045 --> 48:27.148
All right. You can all open your eyes now.

48:29.125 --> 48:31.053
Lizzy, Lizzy, Lizzy.

48:31.055 --> 48:33.413
You've been reunited with
Julia. You're now both dead.

48:33.415 --> 48:35.983
Well, fuck you all.

48:35.985 --> 48:37.928
So, Tala,

48:38.886 --> 48:41.233
we haven't heard a peep
out of you this whole time.

48:41.235 --> 48:44.673
- I'm just observing.
- Hmm, and what do you think?

48:44.675 --> 48:46.793
Well, if you had been
paying attention instead

48:46.795 --> 48:48.293
of pointing fingers at Liz,

48:48.295 --> 48:51.033
maybe you wouldn't trust Nick so much.

48:51.035 --> 48:52.793
I like her already.

48:52.795 --> 48:54.053
Why Nick?

48:54.055 --> 48:55.833
Let's just say that some people

48:55.835 --> 48:57.201
are not who they say they are.

48:57.203 --> 48:58.034
You know, the way I see it,

48:58.036 --> 49:00.113
y'all just trying to gang
up on me for no good reason.

49:00.115 --> 49:02.023
All right guys,
do we need another vote?

49:02.025 --> 49:03.823
Looks like we just lynched Nick.

49:03.825 --> 49:05.743
- Anyone else?
- We all agree.

49:05.745 --> 49:10.385
Not me! I vote for Liz,
but she's already dead.

49:11.220 --> 49:13.606
- Nick the prick.
- Y'all are going to hell.

49:13.608 --> 49:14.441
Oh!

49:15.885 --> 49:19.180
Towns folks, you just
lynched your first werewolf!

49:19.182 --> 49:20.201
- Woo!
- All right!

49:26.782 --> 49:31.532
I found this on the street
right after Liz disappeared.

49:36.963 --> 49:40.373
Have you guys seen the cards

49:40.375 --> 49:41.523
that Alex found in the forest?

49:41.525 --> 49:43.783
Yeah, they're right over there.

49:43.785 --> 49:45.458
Why? What happened.

49:54.225 --> 49:56.043
Sarah, what's going on?

49:56.045 --> 49:57.995
These cards are not from Alex's game.

49:59.191 --> 50:00.433
It's the same cards,

50:00.435 --> 50:02.748
but it's like they're from another deck.

50:11.995 --> 50:13.788
It's not a game. It's a curse.

50:16.275 --> 50:19.153
Ever heard of the lynch mobs in the 1700s?

50:19.155 --> 50:22.033
I don't know. I always
sleep in history class.

50:22.035 --> 50:24.063
Back then there was no
criminal justice system,

50:24.065 --> 50:27.423
so people got together to
hang and torture anyone they

50:27.425 --> 50:30.163
perceived as threats, mostly natives.

50:30.165 --> 50:30.996
Right.

50:30.998 --> 50:32.443
This area holds the record

50:32.445 --> 50:35.343
for the bloodiest lynch mobs
movement in the Midwest.

50:35.345 --> 50:37.545
Yeah, and that's where
the rumors started.

50:38.485 --> 50:39.743
Rumors?

50:39.745 --> 50:41.645
People mysteriously killed at night,

50:42.535 --> 50:45.178
reports of attacks by hairy creatures.

50:46.035 --> 50:46.868
Werewolves.

50:47.735 --> 50:49.883
No one really knew what they
were or where they came from,

50:49.885 --> 50:54.133
but legend says that when
the town abolished lynching,

50:54.135 --> 50:55.135
the attacks stopped.

50:56.535 --> 50:59.868
So is this like a real story?

51:00.815 --> 51:01.663
It's just a legend.

51:01.665 --> 51:03.973
It's an important piece of our history.

51:03.975 --> 51:06.503
Elders believe that
werewolves were lynched people

51:06.505 --> 51:08.893
who came back to life seeking revenge.

51:08.895 --> 51:11.443
So is this our punishment
for playing the game?

51:11.445 --> 51:12.278
Maybe.

51:13.135 --> 51:14.823
Well, I didn't come to this place

51:14.825 --> 51:17.403
- to be a part of its history.
- Too late, Hollywood.

51:17.405 --> 51:18.483
The game's playing us now,

51:18.485 --> 51:19.833
and we don't have much of a choice.

51:19.835 --> 51:22.153
What if I choose not to play?

51:22.155 --> 51:23.805
It doesn't seem like an option.

51:24.715 --> 51:27.463
Yeah. As of now, we only have two.

51:27.465 --> 51:30.190
We win or we die.

51:35.057 --> 51:35.890
A wolf.

51:37.559 --> 51:39.043
I've been here almost 15 years,

51:39.045 --> 51:40.663
and we've never had a wolf attack.

51:40.665 --> 51:42.188
It may not have been a wolf.

51:43.209 --> 51:45.413
It was dark outside. I couldn't see.

51:45.415 --> 51:48.430
I heard this growling, so
it sounded like a wolf.

51:48.432 --> 51:51.443
- And how old's your sister?
- 15.

51:51.445 --> 51:54.023
Were you guys experiment with anything,

51:54.025 --> 51:56.470
or did anybody try to roofie her?

51:56.472 --> 51:58.743
Look, I don't know where
you're going with this,

51:58.745 --> 52:00.213
but none of us could've done this.

52:00.215 --> 52:02.555
We were all passed out.

52:02.557 --> 52:04.853
I expect you were.

52:04.855 --> 52:08.064
But what were you doing
before you blacked out?

52:08.066 --> 52:10.123
- We were playing a game.
- What kind of a game?

52:10.125 --> 52:12.183
Who cares?

52:12.185 --> 52:14.013
Just a card game.

52:14.015 --> 52:16.803
Hey, I'm just collecting
evidence and facts.

52:16.805 --> 52:20.794
Sooner I can get that, the
sooner that we'll get this going.

52:22.825 --> 52:24.119
Dude.

52:24.121 --> 52:25.228
What the hell is wrong with you?

52:30.275 --> 52:32.608
- Are you two on drugs?
- What? No!

52:34.585 --> 52:36.893
May I see your driver's license and ID?

52:36.895 --> 52:38.059
Why?

52:41.245 --> 52:44.008
Driver's license and ID now.

52:49.495 --> 52:51.408
Dude, just do what he says.

52:58.425 --> 53:01.978
This'll just take a minute.
You sit your ass down.

53:08.685 --> 53:10.323
Uh huh.

53:10.325 --> 53:13.163
Looks like you've got a couple
of unpaid parking tickets,

53:13.165 --> 53:16.515
and it looks like you got a DUI or-

53:16.517 --> 53:18.353
- What does that have to
do with my missing sister?

53:18.355 --> 53:19.533
I don't know what it's got to do

53:19.535 --> 53:22.622
with any missing girls or wolves.

53:23.815 --> 53:25.613
Occasionally I get a couple young men

53:25.615 --> 53:28.673
in here that misplace their car,

53:28.675 --> 53:29.743
and then the next day,

53:29.745 --> 53:32.163
they find it a couple of blocks over.

53:32.165 --> 53:33.983
The streets here don't
even have any names.

53:33.985 --> 53:36.713
And you two were out drinking at a party

53:36.715 --> 53:38.785
and you don't remember
the last thing you did.

53:40.175 --> 53:42.103
So you think I'm making this up?

53:42.105 --> 53:44.758
- This is my little sister.
- Yep.

53:45.825 --> 53:48.503
And as far as I'm concerned,

53:48.505 --> 53:51.262
she was your responsibility
to look out for.

53:54.766 --> 53:57.563
So what do we do next?

53:57.565 --> 54:00.808
We don't send out search
parties for 24 hours.

54:02.458 --> 54:06.170
- Fuck!
- Dude, calm the fuck down.

54:06.172 --> 54:08.880
Can't you see he's fucking with us?

54:08.882 --> 54:10.913
You know, I bet the real sheriff

54:10.915 --> 54:13.473
would just love to hear about this.

54:13.475 --> 54:14.308
That's it.

54:16.540 --> 54:17.583
- What the hell are you doing?
- You're coming with me.

54:17.585 --> 54:18.416
Let go of me!

54:18.418 --> 54:20.353
Calm the fuck down! You're not helping.

54:20.355 --> 54:23.688
I got something that can
help, solitary confinement.

54:24.765 --> 54:26.720
You come back for him in the morning,

54:26.722 --> 54:30.348
and if the girl's still missing,
then we'll check into it.

54:32.975 --> 54:34.353
How far is the police station?

54:34.355 --> 54:35.998
10 miles, I think.

54:37.965 --> 54:39.983
There should be some sort of hint

54:39.985 --> 54:42.593
or instructions or something.

54:42.595 --> 54:44.023
Okay, so this is what I was able

54:44.025 --> 54:45.675
to piece together from the party.

54:48.265 --> 54:52.448
So we lynched Julia first,
and then we lynched Alex,

54:54.260 --> 54:56.160
and you saved yourself with the spell.

55:02.105 --> 55:03.893
Then we lynched Liz,

55:03.895 --> 55:07.458
and then we lynched Nick
last as the werewolf.

55:11.862 --> 55:14.613
"Ashes and dust clouds
scatter blue light,

55:14.615 --> 55:18.093
evoking disputes, lynchings, and lies.

55:18.095 --> 55:20.953
Slaughtered villagers vanish at night.

55:20.955 --> 55:22.873
Dawn blots out chaos,

55:22.875 --> 55:25.312
casting away the spell
until the next round."

55:26.535 --> 55:28.013
This is so cryptic.

55:28.015 --> 55:31.103
I can't tell whether it's instructions,

55:31.105 --> 55:33.268
magic spells, warnings...

55:34.515 --> 55:36.215
Slaughtered villagers, warnings.

55:42.865 --> 55:45.123
The game only kills the town folks

55:45.125 --> 55:47.418
that the werewolves
chose as their victims.

55:48.285 --> 55:49.733
Alex is not picking up.

55:49.735 --> 55:51.783
They're probably
on their way back.

55:51.785 --> 55:53.243
Just wanna make sure that they're safe.

55:53.245 --> 55:56.323
No one's safe until we beat the game.

55:56.325 --> 55:58.053
I say we stay put until
the werewolves come

55:58.055 --> 55:59.222
for the next victim.

56:00.175 --> 56:02.592
So, who's it gonna be next?

56:17.135 --> 56:18.893
Where are we going?

56:18.895 --> 56:20.383
The werewolves
only come out at night,

56:20.385 --> 56:22.663
so we have to just survive until dawn.

56:22.665 --> 56:25.203
How are supposed to hunt
them if we can barely see them?

56:25.205 --> 56:28.323
The towns folks can't see
them, but the stray cat can.

56:28.325 --> 56:30.085
Jace! Whoa!

56:38.725 --> 56:41.132
When we played, they won.

56:44.775 --> 56:46.738
Now they're trying to claim their prize.

56:48.135 --> 56:50.018
- Not if we kill them first.
- Dude.

57:50.718 --> 57:51.551
Matt?

57:56.217 --> 57:57.050
Matt!

58:01.118 --> 58:01.951
Oh, Jesus.

58:05.873 --> 58:08.892
Fuck! You scared the shit out of me.

58:08.894 --> 58:12.503
Oh, really? How'd you get here anyway?

58:12.505 --> 58:14.336
What do you mean? I walked.

58:14.338 --> 58:16.383
You walked all the way here?

58:16.385 --> 58:19.378
Matt, the house is like
five minutes that way.

58:20.859 --> 58:21.923
Oh.

58:21.925 --> 58:26.323
- So it's you, isn't it.
- Me what?

58:26.325 --> 58:28.378
The mastermind behind the card game.

58:29.925 --> 58:31.235
Card game?

58:31.237 --> 58:32.873
Don't play dumb.

58:32.875 --> 58:34.643
I'm sure I was next on your list,

58:34.645 --> 58:37.883
so in the interest of saving time,

58:37.885 --> 58:40.743
you can hand over the card, you know,

58:40.745 --> 58:41.843
the one that you were gonna leave

58:41.845 --> 58:44.023
on the scene after I magically vanished.

58:44.025 --> 58:47.128
Whoa, whoa, wait.
What the hell is going on?

58:48.655 --> 58:49.913
I knew Alex was a gamer,

58:49.915 --> 58:51.715
but I didn't know you were in on it.

58:52.575 --> 58:55.025
Hold on, you're talking
about Alex's card game?

58:56.065 --> 58:56.896
What about it?

58:56.898 --> 58:58.533
Not that it's any surprise to you,

58:58.535 --> 59:00.253
but Liz and Julia are missing.

59:00.255 --> 59:03.003
So are you gonna show
me their hiding spot,

59:03.005 --> 59:05.723
or are you saving it all
for the grand finale?

59:05.725 --> 59:07.743
You've got the wrong person.

59:07.745 --> 59:09.393
I've been walking around here for hours.

59:09.395 --> 59:11.695
I couldn't even find my
way out of this place.

59:13.475 --> 59:16.973
Fine. I'll deal with you later.

59:16.975 --> 59:21.975
But just so we're clear,
game's over, and I'm out!

59:25.465 --> 59:26.298
Wait.

59:30.537 --> 59:31.802
- Oh my God, Matt!
- Ow!

59:33.026 --> 59:34.259
Oh my God!

59:36.725 --> 59:38.417
Fuck, I can't feel my leg.

59:38.419 --> 59:43.419
Ow!
Jesus fucking Christ!

59:45.202 --> 59:48.612
Oh, forget it! I'm
gonna go get help, okay?

59:48.614 --> 59:53.614
Hurry! Jesus, fuck!

59:53.825 --> 59:54.658
God.

01:00:14.485 --> 01:00:15.923
- Let her sleep.
- No.

01:00:15.925 --> 01:00:17.623
Her time's up. You need some rest.

01:00:17.625 --> 01:00:20.763
I'll be okay. I'll sleep
when the game's over.

01:00:20.765 --> 01:00:22.575
- Wait, where are you going?
- To the bathroom.

01:00:23.485 --> 01:00:25.045
I'll watch the door.

01:00:38.999 --> 01:00:40.027
What was that?

01:00:45.169 --> 01:00:46.000
What's going on?

01:00:46.002 --> 01:00:47.556
I heard something at the door.

01:00:56.825 --> 01:00:57.833
What are you doing?

01:00:57.835 --> 01:00:59.948
- I don't hear anything.
- Exactly!

01:01:02.634 --> 01:01:04.292
Shit.

01:01:07.245 --> 01:01:10.693
They skipped over Sarah
because she used the spell.

01:01:10.695 --> 01:01:12.103
Now they'll wanna come
after her for a win.

01:01:12.105 --> 01:01:14.243
When they do, I'll shoot them.

01:01:14.245 --> 01:01:15.078
Good plan.

01:01:21.789 --> 01:01:22.934
- Hey.
- Hmm?

01:01:22.936 --> 01:01:24.923
- Wake up.
- What's going on?

01:01:24.925 --> 01:01:27.963
Jacey said he saw a werewolf,
and he's going after it.

01:01:27.965 --> 01:01:28.798
What?

01:01:31.665 --> 01:01:34.963
Jace, do you still hear them?

01:01:34.965 --> 01:01:36.565
No, I think it's gone.

01:01:44.015 --> 01:01:46.135
Go and hide. I'll take care of it.

01:01:46.137 --> 01:01:48.273
- What?
- Just go.

01:01:48.275 --> 01:01:50.018
- Are you serious?
- Jut go!

01:01:51.375 --> 01:01:53.689
Don't come out until I say so.

01:02:12.358 --> 01:02:15.441
How the fuck do we get out of here?

01:02:30.735 --> 01:02:35.103
Hey. Sorry, I broke the window.

01:02:35.105 --> 01:02:38.113
I knocked the front door.
You guys didn't hear me?

01:02:38.115 --> 01:02:39.515
We didn't know it was you.

01:02:40.675 --> 01:02:41.673
Wait, where's your boyfriend?

01:02:41.675 --> 01:02:45.218
He's not my boyfriend,
and he's stuck in a trap.

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:51.395
Here, found it in his back
pocket. Stupid fucking game.

01:02:54.905 --> 01:02:56.723
It's Nick, guys. I'm telling you.

01:02:56.725 --> 01:02:58.863
Nic's just the quiet
one. It's just how he is.

01:02:58.865 --> 01:03:01.343
Hey, sheriff, you're not
allowed to join in on the debate.

01:03:01.345 --> 01:03:05.573
She's right, you can't
intervene. It's in the rules.

01:03:05.575 --> 01:03:09.228
I bet the rules also say
a dead girl can't talk.

01:03:10.288 --> 01:03:11.121
Ha.

01:03:14.325 --> 01:03:15.840
The sheriff.

01:03:19.135 --> 01:03:19.968
It's the game.

01:03:20.981 --> 01:03:21.812
What?

01:03:21.814 --> 01:03:23.418
The forest is keeping him away.

01:03:24.565 --> 01:03:26.243
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:03:26.245 --> 01:03:27.123
The game.

01:03:27.125 --> 01:03:29.313
The sheriff wasn't allowed
to intervene during the game,

01:03:29.315 --> 01:03:30.693
and now the forest is keeping him away.

01:03:30.695 --> 01:03:32.975
- It's the game.
- Fuck the game!

01:03:33.964 --> 01:03:37.136
There's no pattern, no
theories, no werewolf.

01:03:37.138 --> 01:03:40.573
This is all just a sick
joke from an asshole

01:03:40.575 --> 01:03:42.770
who wants to ruin my weekend!

01:03:51.984 --> 01:03:55.078
Hey, what are you doing, man?

01:03:56.165 --> 01:03:58.403
- Put the fucking gun down.
- Connie's here.

01:03:58.405 --> 01:04:01.383
- Wait! It's not safe.
- what do you mean?

01:04:01.385 --> 01:04:03.293
Connie was the werewolf in the game.

01:04:03.295 --> 01:04:05.333
We can't trust her till the game's over.

01:04:05.335 --> 01:04:09.603
Let's just calm down.
Just put the gun down.

01:04:09.605 --> 01:04:11.393
Please put the fucking gun down!

01:04:11.395 --> 01:04:12.778
Oh my God, Connie!

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:14.113
Wait.

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.887
- It's Connie.
- Hey! Hey!

01:04:36.566 --> 01:04:38.483
What the fuck?

01:04:41.221 --> 01:04:43.355
Oh, fuck. No, this
isn't it, this isn't it.

01:04:43.357 --> 01:04:45.690
This isn't where we came in.

01:04:54.093 --> 01:04:57.760
- Are you all right?
- I can't get out of here.

01:05:00.113 --> 01:05:02.051
- Tala!
- Jacey!

01:05:02.053 --> 01:05:03.791
Sarah!

01:05:03.793 --> 01:05:05.626
Jacey! Jacey!

01:05:10.753 --> 01:05:12.683
- Jacey, we're here!
- Jacey!

01:05:12.685 --> 01:05:13.518
Jacey!

01:05:16.919 --> 01:05:18.502
Oh, come on! Jacey!

01:05:22.397 --> 01:05:24.932
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.

01:05:29.196 --> 01:05:32.279
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:05:33.885 --> 01:05:35.535
We to get the fuck out of here.

01:05:36.496 --> 01:05:38.528
Okay.

01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:40.129
Okay.

01:05:40.131 --> 01:05:40.964
Wait.

01:05:42.448 --> 01:05:44.333
Tala.

01:05:44.335 --> 01:05:45.685
Tala, I think its this way.

01:05:49.945 --> 01:05:52.862
Shit. Oh my God, do you see that?

01:05:53.977 --> 01:05:55.150
- I don't see anything.
- It's right there,

01:05:55.152 --> 01:05:56.218
behind the tree.

01:05:59.485 --> 01:06:01.353
It's looking right at you!

01:06:01.355 --> 01:06:04.633
Wait, Tala, the door's here. Let's go.

01:06:04.635 --> 01:06:06.228
Come on, let's go!

01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:08.952
I saved myself during the game.
I'm not dying in this one.

01:06:17.792 --> 01:06:18.625
Tala!

01:06:20.807 --> 01:06:21.640
Tala!

01:06:22.877 --> 01:06:23.710
Tala!

01:06:25.004 --> 01:06:25.837
Tala!

01:06:32.126 --> 01:06:32.959
Tala.

01:06:40.788 --> 01:06:42.362
Tala!

01:06:42.364 --> 01:06:43.511
Sarah!

01:06:47.930 --> 01:06:49.597
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:06:51.490 --> 01:06:52.323
Thank God.

01:07:34.562 --> 01:07:39.562
The game's playing us
now. We win or we die.

01:07:39.715 --> 01:07:43.008
Just go! Don't come out until I say so.

01:07:45.456 --> 01:07:47.521
Tala!

01:07:54.335 --> 01:07:56.285
No one's safe until we beat the game.

01:08:15.135 --> 01:08:17.978
We need to find Connie
and get the fuck out.

01:08:52.377 --> 01:08:53.627
Fuck!

01:08:56.425 --> 01:08:58.973
And then I came out first,

01:08:58.975 --> 01:09:00.992
and I thought she was right behind me,

01:09:00.993 --> 01:09:03.033
so I don't understand where
she would've gone, right?

01:09:03.035 --> 01:09:04.412
Because, I mean, she's
obviously not in here.

01:09:04.415 --> 01:09:07.148
- So I don't understand.
- Sarah.

01:09:19.175 --> 01:09:20.008
Baby.

01:09:23.165 --> 01:09:27.165
Alex. Is this one of
the cards from your game?

01:09:29.712 --> 01:09:30.832
The stray cat.

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:35.819
So she was trying to save me.

01:09:38.064 --> 01:09:39.899
I... I don't know.

01:09:43.866 --> 01:09:44.948
She peeked.

01:09:48.295 --> 01:09:50.412
Yeah! Tala was the stray cat.

01:09:50.415 --> 01:09:53.533
Yeah, I saw her, but if I said anything,

01:09:53.535 --> 01:09:56.423
I'd be serving my own
head on a platter.

01:09:56.425 --> 01:09:58.663
Not exactly.

01:09:58.665 --> 01:10:01.193
When the stray cat gets
caught peeking by a werewolf,

01:10:01.195 --> 01:10:02.562
it gets killed immediately.

01:10:02.564 --> 01:10:05.088
- You could've ended her.
- Ah, there you go.

01:10:19.005 --> 01:10:20.953
Ooh, towns folks.

01:10:20.955 --> 01:10:22.860
You just lynched your first werewolf!

01:10:22.862 --> 01:10:23.973
- Woo!
- All right!

01:10:25.314 --> 01:10:29.041
And on that note, I'm
going on a booze run.

01:10:29.043 --> 01:10:30.973
- You wanna come with?
- Sure.

01:10:30.975 --> 01:10:33.243
Guys, wait. Let's finish the game.

01:10:33.245 --> 01:10:34.573
Why? We're both dead.

01:10:34.575 --> 01:10:38.943
So does this mean I win?

01:10:38.945 --> 01:10:40.633
Oh my God, I knew it was you!

01:10:40.635 --> 01:10:43.322
No, you didn't.

01:10:59.105 --> 01:10:59.938
Jace,

01:11:02.445 --> 01:11:05.144
I thought you said that the
game followed our pattern.

01:11:08.411 --> 01:11:10.982
I did, until we changed the rules.

01:11:12.396 --> 01:11:13.746
But Tala wasn't lynched.

01:11:16.785 --> 01:11:19.338
We stopped playing the
game after we lynched Nick.

01:11:21.425 --> 01:11:22.982
The game is finishing the round for us.

01:11:22.984 --> 01:11:25.794
It's anyone's guess at this point.

01:11:29.365 --> 01:11:31.665
I should've shot Connie
when I had the chance.

01:11:33.755 --> 01:11:35.752
Do you even hear yourself right now?

01:11:58.615 --> 01:12:02.423
Connie, I'm right here.

01:12:02.425 --> 01:12:06.326
Jacey's trying to kill me.
That stupid game got to him.

01:12:06.328 --> 01:12:08.962
We need to
leave this fucking town.

01:12:11.416 --> 01:12:13.405
- Help.
- Damn.

01:12:13.407 --> 01:12:17.240
Fuck!

01:12:20.188 --> 01:12:22.998
- Can you walk?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:12:30.909 --> 01:12:33.709
We need to
get you to a hospital.

01:12:33.711 --> 01:12:36.243
Just call Alex. Tell
him to bring the van.

01:12:36.245 --> 01:12:37.078
Okay.

01:12:40.335 --> 01:12:41.168
Fuck!

01:12:42.008 --> 01:12:44.091
Okay, I'll be right back.

01:12:59.452 --> 01:13:00.285
Okay.

01:13:08.122 --> 01:13:10.705
Come on, come on, come on. Yes!

01:13:15.894 --> 01:13:17.644
Okay. Yes, thank God!

01:13:20.995 --> 01:13:24.080
Okay, sending location. There we go.

01:13:26.818 --> 01:13:29.293
They're safe. Matt's hurt, though.

01:13:29.295 --> 01:13:30.894
Thank God. I'll drive.

01:13:33.755 --> 01:13:35.033
What are you doing, man?

01:13:35.035 --> 01:13:37.193
What I should've done
since the first round.

01:13:37.195 --> 01:13:39.553
No more mistakes. This is
our chance to end the game.

01:13:39.555 --> 01:13:42.263
Jace, it's almost
done. The game is over.

01:13:42.265 --> 01:13:44.273
Not until I kill the last werewolf.

01:13:44.275 --> 01:13:45.925
Move out of my way, man.

01:13:46.955 --> 01:13:49.383
Jace, don't do this.

01:14:05.455 --> 01:14:07.405
I hope he doesn't do anything stupid.

01:14:53.776 --> 01:14:55.292
When we played, they won.

01:14:56.675 --> 01:14:58.651
Now they're trying to claim their prize.

01:14:59.605 --> 01:15:01.005
Not if we kill them first.

01:15:14.385 --> 01:15:15.218
Connie!

01:15:32.749 --> 01:15:33.580
Oh my God.

01:15:56.754 --> 01:15:57.754
Connie!

01:16:19.114 --> 01:16:22.442
- What do you do?
- Shh, Connie, it's okay.

01:16:25.826 --> 01:16:28.101
- It hurts!
- It's okay, I'm here.

01:16:40.703 --> 01:16:44.573
So a wolf jumped on the
car and you missed it?

01:16:44.575 --> 01:16:45.408
Yes.

01:16:47.105 --> 01:16:50.413
- With a shotgun.
- Yes.

01:16:50.415 --> 01:16:53.443
I mean, it happened so quickly.

01:16:53.445 --> 01:16:54.318
Twice.

01:16:55.725 --> 01:16:57.003
By the time I shot at it,

01:16:57.005 --> 01:16:58.705
it was already going after Connie.

01:17:03.105 --> 01:17:06.943
Again, we are so sorry
for all of the trouble.

01:17:06.945 --> 01:17:08.543
It ain't the first
time some city folks come

01:17:08.545 --> 01:17:10.866
down here and a ruckus in this town.

01:17:12.575 --> 01:17:15.043
You two go on and stay safe.

01:17:15.045 --> 01:17:17.945
We'll put out an APB for the
missing girls this afternoon.

01:17:19.814 --> 01:17:21.518
Hey, and do me a favor.

01:17:22.984 --> 01:17:25.863
Go take a firearms course or something.

01:17:25.865 --> 01:17:28.062
I guaran-damn-tee nobody in this town

01:17:28.064 --> 01:17:29.732
would've missed a wolf at 20 yards

01:17:29.734 --> 01:17:32.648
with a shotgun, much less twice.

01:17:40.238 --> 01:17:42.312
- You shot a shotgun?
- Yeah.

01:17:43.147 --> 01:17:43.980
What?

01:18:02.445 --> 01:18:04.858
My father is on his way to see Jacey.

01:18:05.955 --> 01:18:06.998
When can we see him?

01:18:08.078 --> 01:18:10.463
Well, a 72-hour evaluation hold,

01:18:10.465 --> 01:18:14.528
so they're not even letting
in any family or anything.

01:18:24.612 --> 01:18:28.289
What if the game is the only
way to figure out what happened.

01:18:28.291 --> 01:18:30.093
People don't just
disappear into the forest

01:18:30.095 --> 01:18:31.453
or get trapped in a game.

01:18:31.455 --> 01:18:33.705
I had a werewolf card,
too, just like Connie.

01:18:34.721 --> 01:18:36.806
I gotta know if I killed 'em.

01:18:36.808 --> 01:18:38.383
The game got in our heads.

01:18:38.385 --> 01:18:43.052
I know you wouldn't
have hurt Julia or Liz.

01:18:43.054 --> 01:18:46.304
As a human.

01:18:48.575 --> 01:18:52.445
Hey. I lost a sister, too.

01:18:55.752 --> 01:18:57.502
Hey, guys. Come on.

01:19:05.238 --> 01:19:07.488
- He's gonna be fine.
- Is he?

01:19:11.814 --> 01:19:13.163
I'll stick around until Matt and Connie

01:19:13.165 --> 01:19:14.715
are released from the hospital.

01:19:17.072 --> 01:19:17.905
Thanks.

01:19:19.375 --> 01:19:20.892
My father spoke to the nurses,

01:19:20.894 --> 01:19:25.894
and, well, he said that
Jacey keeps going on

01:19:25.972 --> 01:19:28.293
and on about the game

01:19:28.295 --> 01:19:31.123
and how he should've killed the werewolf.

01:19:31.125 --> 01:19:33.225
I mean, he still thinks that we're cursed.

01:19:34.295 --> 01:19:35.495
There is no more game.

01:19:40.377 --> 01:19:42.794
What if someone digs it up?

01:19:50.195 --> 01:19:51.662
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:37.336
