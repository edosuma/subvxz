06:04.031 --> 06:06.180
The reason I ask:
my last school did a project

06:06.200 --> 06:07.607
where each grade built a model

06:07.759 --> 06:09.534
of one of the New Seven Wonders
of the World,

06:09.686 --> 06:11.778
and for the next month,
all subjects--

06:11.930 --> 06:14.021
math, art, history and science--

06:14.116 --> 06:18.192
were taught by designing
and building the project.

06:19.362 --> 06:22.697
If you're undecided, I've got
a much longer presentation.

06:22.866 --> 06:24.457

all this happen,

the dosage or share.

Hey, Buddy, I think

12:16.019 --> 12:18.403

I get it.

12:24.227 --> 12:26.469
I was in love
with my school nurse.

12:26.562 --> 12:29.472
I would hurt myself on purpose
just to see her.

12:29.565 --> 12:32.751
I'd fall off the monkey bars,
bash my head into a wall,

12:32.827 --> 12:37.830
and sometimes I'd even
fall off the monkey bars.

12:37.983 --> 12:40.258
Actually, there is something
I'm dealing with right now.

12:40.409 --> 12:42.743
-My dad's an idiot.
-Listen, you little...

12:42.763 --> 12:46.413
I had brilliant advice
for how to handle a crush.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.492
But now,
I'm keeping it to myself.

12:49.585 --> 12:51.010
I've met her before.

12:51.162 --> 12:53.012

She ruined her dress
