WEBVTT

00:16.125 --> 00:18.250
This is way too high. This is crazy.

00:18.875 --> 00:20.333
All right, party people,

00:20.416 --> 00:21.791
let's get ready to do this!

00:22.791 --> 00:26.416
Huck, I'm not gonna do it, man.
I think I'm gonna skip this jump.

00:26.500 --> 00:27.833
We gotta do this together.

00:27.916 --> 00:30.083
It's my birthday, man.
It's the big two-nine.

00:30.166 --> 00:31.875
Me and you have spent
every birthday together

00:31.958 --> 00:32.875
since you were five.

00:32.958 --> 00:34.500
It's always something crazy.

00:34.583 --> 00:37.375
I just feel like this is too much.
It's too much for me.

00:37.458 --> 00:40.208
-This one's too much?
-Yeah. For me. You do it.

00:40.291 --> 00:42.750
I get it. You're getting married.
You gotta be more responsible.

00:42.833 --> 00:45.125
Yeah, we'll celebrate back at the resort.

00:45.208 --> 00:46.250
Yeah.

00:46.333 --> 00:48.250
I'll get us some champagne,
a little cheese board.

00:48.333 --> 00:49.541
-Yeah. Yeah!
-Right?

00:49.625 --> 00:51.333
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

00:51.416 --> 00:53.958
All right, guys, go get 'em.
I'm not gonna do it.

00:54.541 --> 00:55.416
Hey!

00:56.125 --> 00:57.291
Hey, I'm not gonna ju--

00:59.000 --> 01:01.375
Oh my God!

01:03.416 --> 01:04.875
Sonny, I'm coming.

01:06.083 --> 01:08.208
-Remember your training, Sonny!

01:08.291 --> 01:10.291
I don't remember shit!
I'm scared, man!

01:10.375 --> 01:12.375
Open your arms, like a starfish.

01:12.458 --> 01:15.000
Starfish can't fly!
Huck, starfish are stupid!

01:15.083 --> 01:16.375
Sonny, spread your wings.

01:19.833 --> 01:22.750
Aw!

01:22.833 --> 01:25.333
Hey! I'm doing it!

01:25.875 --> 01:28.416
This is amazing, Huck.

01:28.500 --> 01:29.958
I told you you could do it.

01:30.041 --> 01:33.166
You know, you were right, man.
You're always right.

01:33.250 --> 01:36.875
I'm gonna be by your side
for every birthday until the end of time.

01:36.958 --> 01:38.208
Give me your hand, buddy.

01:38.291 --> 01:40.083
You're my best friend.

01:40.166 --> 01:41.916
I love you, Huck. I lo--

01:43.291 --> 01:47.250
Oh my gosh. They've got sharp teeth!
They've got sharp teeth, Huck.

01:47.333 --> 01:48.708
I think he tried to get to my neck!

01:48.791 --> 01:50.916
-I'm gonna pull your rip cord!

01:51.000 --> 01:53.708
-Sonny, that was incredible.
-Incredible, my ass.

01:53.791 --> 01:56.375
I'm never letting you
talk me into this stupid shit again.

Look at this. Ava, look.

03:01.708 --> 03:02.833
Cool, Daddy.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.791
When you get to school, show your friends.

03:04.875 --> 03:06.750
Can I have some more goji berries
in my smoothie?

03:06.833 --> 03:08.125
Absolutely, buddy.

03:08.208 --> 03:10.375
Antioxidants, whatever you need.
I got-- Shit!

03:10.458 --> 03:12.083
-Ah!

03:12.166 --> 03:15.166
Damn it! Hokey Pokey
went to the bathroom in the kitchen again.

03:15.250 --> 03:17.458
Guys, at this point,
I'm getting a little frustrated

03:17.541 --> 03:19.458
'cause I know you see it. Come on!

03:19.541 --> 03:21.583
-
-Honey, I'm sorry. Give me a kiss.

03:21.666 --> 03:24.333
I gotta run. They're having an inspection
at Armando's this morning.

03:24.416 --> 03:27.833
But… don't forget tonight, okay?
He's getting that big award.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.583
-You don't need me to be there, right?
-Yes.

03:30.666 --> 03:33.041
Well, he's your client.
He's not gonna care if I'm not there.

03:33.125 --> 03:34.916
I know, but baby, I'll care.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.041
-Okay. All right.
-Okay? Okay, good.

03:37.125 --> 03:38.750
-Okay.
-Love it. Where is my iPad?

03:38.833 --> 03:41.541
-Ah, bedside, under your book. Okay? Yeah.
-Okay, thank you, thank you.

03:41.625 --> 03:44.291
Hey, Dash, we talking
about the talent show.

03:44.375 --> 03:46.916
Talk to me. Did you practice
your keyboard this morning?

03:47.000 --> 03:51.125
I was about to, but I got sucked into
watching Eddie Murphy's Raw.

03:51.208 --> 03:53.416
It was so funny
how when the kids would tease him, saying…

03:53.500 --> 03:55.750
…"We got McDonald's."

03:55.833 --> 03:58.625
-Hey, Dash, enough with the comedy, Dash.

03:58.708 --> 04:01.791
Son, this talent show's a big deal.
Remember, I'm the director this year.

04:01.875 --> 04:05.416
The whole school is gonna be judging us.
I need you focused, buddy.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.708
-Here, take a little bit of it.
-What-- That… that's okay.

04:07.791 --> 04:10.041
Come on, man. I'm serious.
I really need you on this, Dash.

04:10.125 --> 04:13.291
You can't just let this float around
like it's nothing, man. It's--

04:13.375 --> 04:16.625
No, I'm not doing this.
It's always a whole thing with Huck.

04:18.416 --> 04:20.166
-Hey!
-Uncle Huck.

04:20.250 --> 04:22.791
Hey, Ava, Dash!
God, I can't believe how big you guys got.

04:22.875 --> 04:25.000
It's so good to see you.
Is your dad around?

04:25.083 --> 04:26.875
-Yes, he is.
-He's right here.

04:26.958 --> 04:29.125
-Sonny, baby!
-Here I am. What's up, Huck?

04:29.208 --> 04:31.500
-What's going on?
-Where are you, man?

04:31.583 --> 04:33.958
-Dude, I'm in Tijuana.
-Tijuana?

04:34.041 --> 04:36.333
We were driving down to Redondo.
We missed the exit.

04:36.416 --> 04:37.666
We were gonna go play mini golf.

04:37.750 --> 04:39.708
We just kept going
all the way down to Mexico.

04:39.791 --> 04:41.083
You gotta do that, right?

04:41.166 --> 04:43.291
Huck, man, I would love to talk,
but I can't, dude.

04:43.375 --> 04:45.375
Gotta get the kids ready.
About to get out the door.

04:45.458 --> 04:47.250
Got a big day
of volunteering at the school.

04:47.333 --> 04:49.833
You remember when we went down
to Mexico for my big two-three,

04:49.916 --> 04:51.333
looking for the donkey show?

04:51.416 --> 04:52.666
Yeah, I'm with the kids, Huck.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.541
-Dad, what's a donkey show?
-Nothing.

04:54.625 --> 04:56.875
-We found a donkey on the road.
-Yeah.

04:56.958 --> 05:01.458
Hand to God,
biggest P-E-N-I-S I have ever seen.

05:01.541 --> 05:03.041
-Okay.
-What did he spell?

05:03.125 --> 05:05.541
-He spelled "penis."
-Hey, boy, what are you doing?

05:05.625 --> 05:06.750
It's not a swear word.

05:06.833 --> 05:08.916
Dash is right.
It's not a swear word. It's a body part.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.833
I know exactly what it is, Huck.
I got one.

05:10.916 --> 05:12.958
-Do I have one?
-No, you don't.

05:13.041 --> 05:17.541
In life, if you chose at some point
you wanted one, you could get it.

05:17.625 --> 05:19.333
-It's complicated.
-Real quick, dude.

05:19.416 --> 05:21.250
My birthday's coming up.
It's the big four-four.

05:21.333 --> 05:23.458
I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't an important birthday.

05:23.541 --> 05:26.291
You haven't been to my parties in forever.
Any chance you could make it?

05:26.375 --> 05:28.791
-Yeah--
-I think that's a great idea.

05:28.875 --> 05:31.250
He needs some time to his self. Hi, Huck.

05:31.333 --> 05:34.458
Hey, what's up, girl?
Oh my God. You look amazing.

05:34.541 --> 05:36.583
-We miss you.
-I miss you guys so much.

05:36.666 --> 05:40.208
Huck, listen, I really wish I could.
I don't know what Maya's talking about.

05:40.291 --> 05:43.208
We're gonna be at her parents'
for spring break. I can't make it.

05:43.291 --> 05:46.833
Oh, gosh, that's so disappointing. I mean,
I completely understand. Family first.

05:46.916 --> 05:47.875
-It's too bad.
-Yeah.

05:47.958 --> 05:48.958
All right. Bye, Huck!

05:49.041 --> 05:51.750
-Bye, Maya.
-All right, bye. Love you. Okay.

05:51.833 --> 05:54.791
Um, Huck, dude, listen, I gotta jump, man.

05:54.875 --> 05:57.416
So good talking to you.
So, so good talking to you.

05:57.500 --> 05:59.958
We'll catch up soon, okay?
Hey, say goodbye, hang up.

06:00.041 --> 06:01.916
All right, look,
I'm gonna send you the deets

06:02.000 --> 06:05.125
just in case, if you can make it,
and a pic of the donkey's D-I-C-K.

06:05.208 --> 06:06.500
-Pic of what?
-It's unreal.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.208
Don't send no pic of that donkey's dick--

06:08.291 --> 06:10.083
-Shit! Goddamn!

06:11.833 --> 06:13.583
-Same piece of poop got me again.

06:13.666 --> 06:16.583
Ava, honey, this is getting crazy.
You gotta start carrying your own bag.

06:16.666 --> 06:17.666
I don't want to.

06:17.750 --> 06:20.250
All right, noted,
but that doesn't mean you don't have to.

06:20.333 --> 06:22.666
Sometimes it'd be nice
to help your father, okay?

06:23.166 --> 06:24.916
Oh, Dad, Asher Geller's dad

06:25.000 --> 06:28.750
got a minivan with automatic doors.
Whoo, it's sick.

06:28.833 --> 06:29.666
Son, listen to me,

06:29.750 --> 06:32.375
opening up the door
with your hands builds character.

06:32.458 --> 06:34.708
Lesson of the day. Let's go. In.

06:34.791 --> 06:37.916
All right, guys,
who's ready to go to school, huh?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.125
-I am!
-Yeah.

06:39.208 --> 06:40.666
Son, match Ava's energy.

06:41.291 --> 06:42.250
-I am!

06:42.875 --> 06:44.583
Hey, hey, hey!

06:44.666 --> 06:46.708


06:46.791 --> 06:48.500
Sixty seconds or less. Let's go.

06:53.208 --> 06:54.833
Morning, Crossing Guard Lenore.

06:54.916 --> 06:56.916
Good morning, Mr. PTA President.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.750
Let's go, guys. Time to go to school.

07:01.208 --> 07:02.458
Gotta get it off the track.

07:03.083 --> 07:05.208
-I love you. I love you too.
-Love you, Dad.

07:05.291 --> 07:06.333
-Bye, Daddy.
-Bye!

07:06.416 --> 07:09.375
It's our job to give our kids options.

07:09.458 --> 07:12.875
Taste the hemp. Hemp. Not every kid
even knows that hemp is available,

07:12.958 --> 07:14.750
and that's not fair to them.

07:14.833 --> 07:16.250
"It was just the right putter--"

07:16.875 --> 07:19.291
So we're not listening?
Are we not gonna listen today?

07:19.375 --> 07:21.375
Sonny, I've got this.
Have a seat. Thank you.

07:21.458 --> 07:24.125
-All right. Hey.

07:54.833 --> 07:56.916
Hey! What the hell was that, Alan?

07:57.000 --> 08:00.625
Oh, Sonny, some of us gotta get back
to the office, my friend. Hey, guys.

08:00.708 --> 08:02.750
Well, you know what?
Some of us gotta get citations.

08:02.833 --> 08:04.208
-Hmm?
-Oh, no!

08:04.291 --> 08:05.750
-Yeah. Yeah.
-A citation?

08:05.833 --> 08:08.125
So just wait here.
Crossing Guard Lenore, did you see that?

08:08.208 --> 08:10.916
Dad! That's the, uh, car
with the, uh, automatic doors.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.833
I get it. C'mon, let's go.
Get in the car, guys.

08:12.916 --> 08:16.125
I mean, I would,
but the door's, like… it's too heavy.

08:16.208 --> 08:18.416
Oh, so you got jokes, now?
What'd I tell you?

08:18.500 --> 08:21.666
All you gotta do is lift the door.
You lift it and pull it back.

08:21.750 --> 08:23.041
It's too easy. Let's go.

08:23.625 --> 08:26.208
All right, Skyler, do me a favor,
make sure the polenta doesn't stay

08:26.291 --> 08:28.875
in the Instant Pot too long
'cause if it does, it'll get real gummy.

08:28.958 --> 08:29.958
-Yeah.
-Uh, oh. Yeah.

08:30.041 --> 08:34.541
All right, and after dinner,
Dash has to do 20 minutes on the piano.

08:34.625 --> 08:36.500
-Okay? Yes.
-Dad, you're killing me.

08:36.583 --> 08:39.000
I'm already underwater with reading comp.

08:39.083 --> 08:40.750
Ten thousand hours, buddy. You know that.

08:40.833 --> 08:43.500
It's not about being good.
It's about being great.

08:43.583 --> 08:46.000
It's a little life lesson.
It's called double G.

08:46.083 --> 08:48.583
-Thank you so much, Skyler.
-Have fun, Mr. F.

08:48.666 --> 08:51.208
At mouth2mouth, when you buy a toothbrush,

08:51.291 --> 08:52.916
we donate one to a person in need.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.208
Our dream is that,
through the simple act of brushing,

08:56.833 --> 08:59.583
we will be reminded
that we are all one world,

09:00.333 --> 09:01.375
one people.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.750
-Armando!

09:05.000 --> 09:07.458
-To Armando. Congratulations.
-Thank you so much.

09:07.541 --> 09:08.375
Congratulations.

09:08.458 --> 09:10.875
Thank you for being here. Thank you. Yeah.

09:10.958 --> 09:12.916
Tell us more
about your tortoise sanctuary.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.375
Here's the thing, for me…

09:14.458 --> 09:17.458
-…had none. I was like--

09:18.958 --> 09:20.333
-I see you, Dash!

09:21.000 --> 09:24.375
-I see you.
-Dad, I literally just peed my pants.

09:24.458 --> 09:27.250
That doesn't take away the fact
you're not doing what you're supposed to.

09:27.333 --> 09:28.333
-Come on.
-Our son.

09:28.416 --> 09:31.625
You're watching Tiffany Haddish stand-up.
You're not practicing your music.

09:31.708 --> 09:33.291
Now I know you think you're a comedian,

09:33.375 --> 09:35.750
but this talent show
is all about your keyboard skills.

09:35.833 --> 09:37.916
-I'm watching you. Bye.
-So sweet.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.541
Honey, listen, let it go.
It's okay if he doesn't practice tonight.

09:41.625 --> 09:43.375
-You know kids.
-No, no, it's not okay.

09:43.458 --> 09:44.916
How do you all know each other?

09:45.000 --> 09:47.666
Well, I hired
the great architect Norman Bogart

09:47.750 --> 09:52.000
to design my house
slash tortoise sanctuary in Topanga,

09:52.083 --> 09:55.458
and I quickly realized
this genius right here,

09:56.083 --> 09:57.708
she was doing all the work.

09:57.791 --> 09:59.291
Armando, come on.

09:59.375 --> 10:01.708
You know it's true.
You can't say it, I can.

10:02.291 --> 10:05.125
Anyway, we started texting
day and night, and here we are.

10:05.208 --> 10:09.208
Two years later, I have a beautiful home
and an even more beautiful friendship.

10:10.666 --> 10:12.916
And this is Maya's husband, um, Sonny.

10:13.458 --> 10:15.541
-Oh, wow, hi.
-Oh, hi.

10:15.625 --> 10:17.125
And what is it that you do, Sonny?

10:18.083 --> 10:21.041
Uh… Well, I… I am a--

10:21.125 --> 10:23.125
-He's a housewife.
-Oh.

10:23.208 --> 10:25.666
English is not my first language.
I don't know the terminology,

10:25.750 --> 10:26.875
but he stays at home.

10:26.958 --> 10:28.916
-He's great with the kids.
-It's a lot of work.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.666
-It's a very contemporary relationship.
-It is.

10:31.750 --> 10:34.583
-How's the company doing, Raj?
-It's doing incredibly well.

10:34.666 --> 10:36.833
We're shipping
culturally appropriate condoms

10:36.916 --> 10:39.000
to North India
to help lower the STD rates.

10:39.083 --> 10:41.875
So the mission of the organization
is to eradicate land mines.

10:41.958 --> 10:45.041
-Well, that is just something--
-Yeah, I agree.

10:45.125 --> 10:46.291
There was a… a…

10:53.333 --> 10:56.541
Actually, my girls and I
spent the last year in Barcelona.

10:56.625 --> 10:59.208
We opened four schools
for the children in the countryside.

10:59.291 --> 11:03.125
You speaking about that just made me
think of my daughter, who's five now.

11:03.208 --> 11:04.500
She's taking Mandarin.

11:04.583 --> 11:06.125
We go to a Chinese restaurant.

11:06.208 --> 11:08.500
She starts speaking Mandarin
while we're at the restaurant,

11:08.583 --> 11:10.458
and out of nowhere
they bring out a secret menu.

11:10.541 --> 11:14.125
I'm like, "Okay." Right?

11:14.208 --> 11:15.458
It's… it's…

11:15.541 --> 11:18.125
I mean, you can only imagine, you know?

11:21.208 --> 11:25.166
You know, you would think for $20 an hour
that Skyler would clean the Instant Pot.

11:25.875 --> 11:27.291
-Honey?
-Hmm?

11:27.958 --> 11:30.000
Where were you going
with that whole Mandarin thing?

11:30.083 --> 11:31.500
Ava doesn't speak Mandarin.

11:31.583 --> 11:33.708
She's been taking Mandarin
for, like, six months.

11:33.791 --> 11:35.833
-Really? She has?
-Yes.

11:37.708 --> 11:38.708
It's "good morning."

11:39.208 --> 11:43.166
I think it is. She says it every morning.
And what do you mean, "Where was I going?"

11:43.250 --> 11:45.458
I'm trying to get in
on a conversation, Maya.

11:45.541 --> 11:46.666
You got me at the table

11:46.750 --> 11:49.208
with a bunch of world leaders.
What am I supposed to talk about,

11:49.291 --> 11:50.208
my kindergarten blog?

11:50.291 --> 11:51.125
Yeah--

11:51.208 --> 11:53.375
Tell me what I'm supposed to say
to the condom man

11:53.458 --> 11:54.916
who's handing out rubbers in India?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
That's a good thing.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.833
I don't even wanna get started on Armando.

11:57.916 --> 11:59.875
-Don't. Yes.
-Armando? What about Armando?

11:59.958 --> 12:01.583
What do you mean,
"What do I mean"?

12:01.666 --> 12:03.666
Oh, wait. Wait, wait. Babe, it's Huck.

12:03.750 --> 12:04.750
Ignore it. Ignore it.

12:04.833 --> 12:05.666
-Igno--
-Yes.

12:05.750 --> 12:07.291
I don't wanna talk to Huck right now.

12:07.375 --> 12:10.541
I don't wanna see a donkey's dick
in Tijuana or discuss his birthday.

12:10.625 --> 12:12.666
I understand, baby,
but it's too bad you can't go.

12:12.750 --> 12:14.583
I mean, come on, you guys were so close.

12:14.666 --> 12:16.708
And you know you used to have
the best time together.

12:16.791 --> 12:19.500
Yes, Maya, we did, and then I grew up.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.625
That's what happens in life.
I got married. I had kids.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.750
I'm sorry that I don't wanna spend
a weekend with Huck

12:24.833 --> 12:27.458
celebrating his 44th birthday
with a bunch of 22-year-olds.

12:27.541 --> 12:29.083
-All right, fine.
-Thank you.

12:29.166 --> 12:31.916
-Let's get back to this Armando thing.
-Babe, there's no Armando thing.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.291
Why'd he have his hand
on your shoulder for six seconds?

12:34.375 --> 12:37.291
-Did you count?
-It was six seconds. I counted.

12:37.375 --> 12:38.791
Right above your collarbone.

12:38.875 --> 12:41.500
And by the way, it bothered me
because you have a high breast.

12:41.583 --> 12:42.666
What?

12:42.750 --> 12:44.708
Because of your high breast,
if his hand got lower,

12:44.791 --> 12:45.791
he's grabbing titty.

12:45.875 --> 12:47.625
It was my shoulder.

12:47.708 --> 12:50.458
-I think you're really overreacting.
-No! No, I'm not!

12:50.541 --> 12:53.333
Think I don't see his games?
I see right through him.

12:53.416 --> 12:55.416
-We're in a chess match.
-A chess match?

12:55.500 --> 12:57.541
Yes. You can't see it
because you're not a guy.

12:57.625 --> 13:00.541
-Okay. All right.
-Maya, I'm very serious.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.208
It's a guy thing.

13:02.291 --> 13:06.041
I still can't believe that I didn't know
Ava was taking Mandarin.

13:06.125 --> 13:08.500
I feel like the worst mom ever.

13:08.583 --> 13:12.208
You know what you need? You just need
some quality time with the kids.

13:12.708 --> 13:13.791
Oh, look.

13:13.875 --> 13:15.333
-What?
-Look at this.

13:16.291 --> 13:18.625
"Thank you for coming." See that?

13:18.708 --> 13:20.916
Armando just sent that text. See?

13:21.416 --> 13:23.041
Oh, wait, was that some kind of…

13:23.125 --> 13:24.958
…"move" in the chess match?

13:25.041 --> 13:26.750
-It actually was.

13:26.833 --> 13:28.291
What is that?

13:29.916 --> 13:32.666
He sent you a… a GIF from Bridgerton?

13:32.750 --> 13:35.500
I'm not gonna make a big deal out of it,
but I think it's inappropriate.

13:35.583 --> 13:38.791
-Right? That's just… just me saying.
-I don't think he meant anything by it.

13:38.875 --> 13:42.041
You know, that's, uh…
that's actually next on our watch list.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.583
Bridgerton?
I can't wait to see it, either.

13:44.666 --> 13:48.000
You know, I might have binged it
with Armando on our flight to New York.

13:48.083 --> 13:49.333
Are you kidding me right now?

13:49.416 --> 13:50.750
We put it on our watch list.

13:50.833 --> 13:53.041
-I know.
-That means we're watching it together.

13:53.125 --> 13:56.250
You know what I watched instead of that?
Storage Wars. Reruns.

13:56.333 --> 13:58.083
-Wow.
-I can't get that piece of my life back.

13:58.166 --> 14:01.000
-Baby, I'm so sorry. I don't… I… I--
-Ooh, that's insane.

14:02.166 --> 14:03.000
You know what?

14:05.333 --> 14:06.708
I actually have an idea.

14:07.250 --> 14:09.791
All right, I accept your apology.

14:09.875 --> 14:11.375
No, listen, I want to tell you.

14:11.458 --> 14:15.208
-What do you mean, tell me? Come on.
-No, but I want to tell you what it is.

14:15.291 --> 14:17.166
-Go back to the side.
-Yeah. No, baby.

14:17.250 --> 14:19.291
-I can last longer from the side.
-That's good.

14:19.375 --> 14:21.666
-Can I tell you something first?
-All right, well, hurry up.

14:21.750 --> 14:24.916
Okay, I'm thinking maybe
I should take Dash and Ava

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
for spring break, but by myself.

14:27.750 --> 14:30.791
-What?
-Yeah, I need quality time with the kids.

14:30.875 --> 14:32.833
-Maya…
-You could use time without them.

14:32.916 --> 14:35.458
You know, you could stay here
and have a week to yourself.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.791
You've never traveled
with them without me.

14:37.875 --> 14:39.166
I am their mother.

14:39.250 --> 14:41.666
-I know. I get that.
-Sonny? Hello? I will be fine.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.666
I mean, come on.
Just think about it.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.416
-Okay. I'll… I'll think about it.
-Okay.

14:48.500 --> 14:49.708
-All right?
-Yeah.

14:49.791 --> 14:51.250
Now, I need to know what I'm doing.

14:51.333 --> 14:53.666
Are these pants staying down,
or they coming up?

14:55.166 --> 14:57.083
-Down.
-Oh.

14:57.833 --> 14:59.458
Sonny, what is there
to think about?

14:59.541 --> 15:02.750
A week without their family
is literally every man's dream.

15:02.833 --> 15:06.541
Every man's dream?
Alan, you don't think moms need a break?

15:06.625 --> 15:08.791
I'm working full-time
at the real estate agency

15:08.875 --> 15:11.375
and still expected to do
everything with these kids.

15:11.458 --> 15:14.458
Okay, first of all, Jill, you and Hank,
you share custody, all right?

15:14.541 --> 15:16.791
So it's not like
you don't have time for yourself. You do.

15:16.875 --> 15:19.291
No, I don't,
'cause this bitch talking about,

15:19.375 --> 15:21.375
"Oh, I'm on a business
trip every other weekend,"

15:21.458 --> 15:23.208
when I know he's just doing CrossFit.

15:23.291 --> 15:27.750
Okay? And now I only get one day a month
to stack up all my Tinder dates.

15:27.833 --> 15:28.791
And how's that going?

15:28.875 --> 15:30.500
I mean, I'm fucking,

15:30.583 --> 15:33.208
but you know, I don't have time
to develop anything meaningful.

15:33.291 --> 15:34.625
-Right. Yeah, no connection.
-Whoa!

15:34.708 --> 15:36.041
Just getting smashed to pieces.

15:36.125 --> 15:39.333
God, I wish Jeremiah would take
the twins from me for the weekend.

15:39.416 --> 15:42.708
I haven't been alone
in my house in like a decade.

15:42.791 --> 15:43.875
Hey, Stew.

15:44.541 --> 15:47.041
Right, you know, talking about "me time,"

15:47.125 --> 15:48.625
-there's value in it.
-Big-time.

15:48.708 --> 15:51.208
But is it really worth
missing a family vacation?

15:51.291 --> 15:52.875
You have no life outside of your kids.

15:52.958 --> 15:54.500
-That's not true.
-Yes, it is.

15:54.583 --> 15:57.250
Sonny, ignore them. There's nothing
wrong with being a devoted parent.

15:57.333 --> 15:59.958
Bethany, come on,
you're basically your children's butler.

16:00.041 --> 16:02.208
Diane and I have our routine dialed in.

16:02.291 --> 16:04.291
I'm the caregiver,
and she's the breadwinner.

16:04.375 --> 16:06.833
We both know our roles,
so there's zero conflict.

16:06.916 --> 16:09.041
It's called a system, which works, guys.

16:09.125 --> 16:11.583
-Right? That's good for you guys.
-A prison system, sounds like.

16:11.666 --> 16:12.791
I like my life.

16:12.875 --> 16:16.208
-Shut up, Bethany. You do not.
-What is this, Sonny, no everythings?

16:16.291 --> 16:17.666
What are you doing right now, Alan?

16:17.750 --> 16:20.208
Are you really putting
your hand on every bagel?

16:20.291 --> 16:21.583
Trying to find the everythings.

16:21.666 --> 16:25.208
Every single Café Friday, Alan,
you complain about everything,

16:25.291 --> 16:26.375
yet you bring nothing.

16:26.458 --> 16:27.625
Me, on the other hand,

16:27.708 --> 16:29.291
I'm putting the presentation together.

16:29.375 --> 16:30.375
I'm putting this out.

16:30.458 --> 16:33.083
'Cause this is all you focus on.
You need to let Maya take the kids.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.541
-Can you let it go?
-You have to.

16:34.625 --> 16:36.625
I'm worried you'll turn
into Crossing Guard Lenore.

16:36.708 --> 16:37.750
What are you talking about?

16:37.833 --> 16:40.000
You're turning into Lenore
whether you know it or not.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.833
Okay, I just happen to love
Crossing Guard Lenore.

16:42.916 --> 16:44.458
-We all do. It's sad.
-What's your point?

16:44.541 --> 16:46.583
Her kids went to this school.
She was a full-time mom,

16:46.666 --> 16:48.666
director of the talent show,
head of the PTA.

16:48.750 --> 16:50.750
She had no life outside of this place.

16:50.833 --> 16:52.166
Does that sound familiar to you?

16:52.958 --> 16:56.625
Yeah, well, her husband leaves her,
kids don't need her anymore,

16:57.125 --> 17:00.708
and one day out of nowhere,
she just shows up with the vest on.

17:01.333 --> 17:03.625
Crossing guard's not even
an official position, Sonny.

17:05.583 --> 17:07.708
-It's not?
-No, it's not.

17:09.666 --> 17:10.583
I know.

17:13.666 --> 17:16.166
-I'm becoming Crossing Guard Lenore.
-Yeah.

17:16.958 --> 17:18.916
-That's it, I'm staying home.
-Really?

17:19.000 --> 17:20.166
-Yeah, really.
-Yes!

17:20.250 --> 17:23.041
Okay, you're gonna need
a Sherpa next week, so I am telling Rita

17:23.125 --> 17:25.416
she's taking the kids
to Legoland by herself.

17:25.500 --> 17:26.958
Are you sure she's gonna go for that?

17:27.041 --> 17:30.041
Are you kidding me?
I rule the roost, pal. I'm not like you.

17:30.125 --> 17:32.291
All right, so what's on the agenda?
Let's do this.

17:32.375 --> 17:34.708
How about we… how about we start off
with some golf, right?

17:34.791 --> 17:36.083
-Yeah.
-Some food.

17:36.166 --> 17:37.875
Maybe find an underground barbecue spot.

17:37.958 --> 17:40.833
Or we go to a gentleman's cabaret.

17:40.916 --> 17:42.875
-Absolutely not. No.
-Yes.

17:42.958 --> 17:44.875
Don't you wanna get smashed
between something?

17:44.958 --> 17:46.583
-No. Not that.
-What are you talking about?

17:46.666 --> 17:48.291
You don't go to titty bars, a strip club?

17:48.375 --> 17:50.125
-No, I do not. And it--
-Why?

17:50.208 --> 17:52.708
Because it makes me feel
as if I'm… as if I'm cheating.

17:52.791 --> 17:54.708
-It's not cheating.
-Ah, it is.

17:54.791 --> 17:57.666
No, it's harmless flirtation
with a professional body worker.

17:57.750 --> 17:59.208
-No.
-Where do you masturbate?

17:59.291 --> 18:00.750
-I'm sorry?
-Where do you jerk off?

18:00.833 --> 18:03.583
-No. Ah, good to see you.
-She does too.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.250
-You're out of line.
-Tell me on three.

18:05.333 --> 18:07.083
-I'm not telling you anything.
-One, two, three.

18:07.166 --> 18:08.125
-Shower.
-I knew it.

18:08.208 --> 18:10.791
-You didn't say it. You repeated it.
-Yes, I did.

18:10.875 --> 18:12.833
You're relegated
to jerking off in a watery prison

18:12.916 --> 18:14.708
because your family is always home.

18:14.791 --> 18:17.833
The freedom, Sonny, to have yourself
in any room in your house,

18:17.916 --> 18:19.083
that's why we fight wars.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.125
Okay.

18:20.208 --> 18:22.250
"I bought this house.
I'm gonna jerk off in it!"

18:22.333 --> 18:24.375
-Right? You deserve that!
-Right! Yeah, no, no. No.

18:24.458 --> 18:26.208
-I do deserve it. Yes!
-Yes, you do!

18:26.291 --> 18:28.791
This is gonna be revolutionary, baby.
We're gonna be real friends!

18:28.875 --> 18:31.916
Whoa! Wait, what do you mean,
"We're gonna be"? We are friends, dude.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.250
-We're parent friends.
-I've known you for seven years.

18:34.333 --> 18:36.500
You're saved in my phone as "Dash's Dad."

18:36.583 --> 18:38.625
-What do you mean?
-I didn't know your name for three years.

18:38.708 --> 18:40.583
When we become friends, I'll change it.

18:40.666 --> 18:41.833
Okay, water under the bridge,

18:41.916 --> 18:43.958
you're right about everything.
You got me pumped up!

18:44.041 --> 18:45.750
-Let's go!
-I get some me time.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.000
-You time.
-It's about me time!

18:47.083 --> 18:48.458
-Me time!

18:48.541 --> 18:50.916
Mom, Mom, do you think
Grandma and Grandpa have Wi-Fi?

18:51.000 --> 18:53.958
Yes, I'm sure they do, baby.
I'm sure. Just go get your stuff.

18:54.041 --> 18:56.708
-Come on, we're gonna miss our flight.
-Dash, forgot your keys.

18:56.791 --> 18:58.125
Come on, Dad. We packed carry-ons,

18:58.208 --> 19:00.125
and now we're gonna have to wait
at baggage claim?

19:00.208 --> 19:02.750
Come on, son, now you know
you got to nail this talent show.

19:02.833 --> 19:05.375
All I'm asking for is
20 minutes a day. You got that.

19:05.458 --> 19:08.791
I bet all the other kids are practicing
during vacation. Here, Maya.

19:10.166 --> 19:12.166
-Wait, what is this?
-Ava's EpiPen.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.000
-Ep-- Oh my G--
-Yes.

19:14.083 --> 19:17.250
-Oh God! How could I forget this?
-What are you talking about?

19:17.333 --> 19:19.791
There's one in the backpack.
I just keep a spare one on me.

19:19.875 --> 19:22.541
Okay, I think you were right.
I don't think this is a good idea.

19:22.625 --> 19:26.000
Stop it. You're overreacting.
You're breathing all crazy.

19:26.083 --> 19:27.958
Kids, tell your mother
that you gonna be okay

19:28.041 --> 19:29.208
without me for a few days.

19:29.291 --> 19:33.833
Well, honestly, I have concerns.
I'm sorry, Mom, but Dad's the glue.

19:33.916 --> 19:35.625
-Goddamn it. No.
-Did you hear what he just--

19:35.708 --> 19:38.000
Dash, get… get… get your stuff.
Help me with the bags.

19:38.083 --> 19:39.000
What are you doing?

19:39.083 --> 19:41.041
Oh, Dad, can you finish
my Lego Death Star, please?

19:41.125 --> 19:42.750
No, I cannot finish the Death Star

19:42.833 --> 19:45.250
'cause this week is about
Daddy taking time for himself.

19:45.333 --> 19:47.416
-It's me time. Gimme the bags.
-Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.625
-I like this new Sonny.
-What do you mean?

19:49.708 --> 19:51.958
-I don't think I've ever heard you say no.
-Bye, Mommy.

19:52.041 --> 19:54.833
-Baby, I'm coming.
-What do you mean? I say no all the time.

19:54.916 --> 19:56.791
I'm the definition of the law around here.

19:56.875 --> 19:58.291
Murphy's Law, maybe.

19:58.375 --> 20:01.416
Come on, babies, get in the car.
Dash, scooch over. Lock your sister in.

20:02.625 --> 20:05.500
-All right. I love you.
-Hey, just have fun this week, okay?

20:05.583 --> 20:07.625
-I am. I'm gonna have a good time.
-Good. Good.

20:07.708 --> 20:09.500
-And you should go to Huck's party.
-No.

20:09.583 --> 20:12.791
-Cut loose like you used to.
-No, I'm not going to Huck Dembo's party.

20:12.875 --> 20:15.375
I told you, our lives have
nothing in common anymore.

20:15.458 --> 20:17.166
I don't wanna talk about me.
I wanna talk about you.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.458
-Yes.
-No work.

20:18.541 --> 20:20.750
No, I'm gonna get
that quality mama time in.

20:20.833 --> 20:22.916
-You know it, I promise.
-Good. All right, I love you.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.916
-Go. All right, bye.
-I'm gonna miss you. Yeah.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.291
-Be safe. I love you guys.
-Bye, Daddy!

20:27.375 --> 20:29.125
-Y'all got your seatbelts on?
-Death Star.

20:29.208 --> 20:31.875
Dash, put your head in the window
before a car take your head off.

20:31.958 --> 20:34.000
-Get in the car. Love you all!
-Bye, honey.

No. There… there's
no world where I'm doing that.

She went to her parents' house.

"Go, I need a break." Right?

Yeah. Looks pretty good, huh?

The boat? We're not on a boat?

-Huh.

27:46.375 --> 27:48.416
-Always.
-You like the suit?

27:48.500 --> 27:50.583
-Yes!
-I got suits for everybody.

27:50.666 --> 27:53.583

Think I'm gonna go ahead

28:22.333 --> 28:24.250
Our desks are
right next to each other at WeWork.

28:24.333 --> 28:26.041
All right, that's cool.

28:26.625 --> 28:29.041
You don't, uh… you don't work
at the ad agency anymore?

28:29.125 --> 28:31.416
No, I haven't been there
for a couple of years.

28:31.500 --> 28:33.041
They were dinosaurs.

28:33.125 --> 28:35.250
I opened up my own shop.
We focus on brand synergy,

28:35.333 --> 28:37.541
vertical integration, next-level stuff.

Eh, Sonny. It's Sonny, no?

28:42.750 --> 28:44.916
Huck told us
that you are a stay-at-home parent.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.166
-Yeah. Yes!
-This is very inspiring to us.

28:47.250 --> 28:48.083
Oh, okay. Yeah.

28:48.166 --> 28:51.583
-Well… well, my wife is an architect.
-She's amazing.

28:51.666 --> 28:54.958
I was doing data entry for Citibank
while I was pursuing a music career,

28:55.041 --> 28:57.166
but after we had our second child,

28:57.250 --> 28:59.208
I said, "It's probably best
for me to stay at home,

28:59.291 --> 29:01.291
take care of the kids
rather than pay for childcare."

29:01.375 --> 29:03.416
-What a real man would do.
-Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah.

29:03.500 --> 29:04.500
Hey, what do you play?

29:04.583 --> 29:07.500
Ah, keyboard. They call me Dr. Silk.

29:07.583 --> 29:09.875
I'm a singer-songwriter,
and adult contemporary, that's--

29:09.958 --> 29:11.166
-Don't be modest.
-I love it.

29:11.250 --> 29:14.791
-Sonny put out an album. It's fantastic.

-No.
-So how would we hear it?

29:24.958 --> 29:26.041

-Yeah.

29:26.125 --> 29:27.500

and because of the great pan-d,

31:31.541 --> 31:35.125
we spent too long
without the simple joy of being together.

-So, this week isn't about me.

31:37.708 --> 31:39.583
-It's about us.
-Okay.

33:36.750 --> 33:38.750
I didn't know
what the vibe would be,

so I kind of got more
of a resort dress code going on, man.

-But, you know, I'll make it work.
-Oh, you're making it work. You always do.

33:44.458 --> 33:47.416
All right, beautiful people,
let's get organized.

33:47.500 --> 33:50.875
I know it's a little early,
but we gotta turn our attention to dinner.

33:51.375 --> 33:55.375
Oh, now we're talking. What're you doing?
You doing how you used to do?

33:55.458 --> 33:58.708
Probably got some steaks,
some American Wagyu coming? What you got?

33:58.791 --> 34:01.750
Nope. We're gonna forage
for our own food. Pull the tarp.

34:02.875 --> 34:06.375
Hey, I'm a beekeeper by trade,
but I forage in my downtime.

34:06.458 --> 34:08.666
So, if anybody got any questions,
just hit me up.

34:08.750 --> 34:12.916
Okay, I got the first question, which is,
"Why are you guys messing with me?" Huh?

34:13.458 --> 34:16.500
Stop it, man. I saw the YETI coolers.
I know there's food in there, Huck.

34:16.583 --> 34:19.291
Oh, we have some apps,
but the main course is up to us.

34:19.375 --> 34:22.208
Grab a machete and a basket,
and let's get our forage on!

34:24.250 --> 34:26.041
We gotta hunt for our food?

34:26.125 --> 34:28.416
Huck, real quick, uh, excuse me.

34:28.500 --> 34:29.750
-What?
-Gotta go to the bathroom.

34:29.833 --> 34:32.833
-Where the porta-potties at?
-Oh, right there.

34:32.916 --> 34:36.041
-That's a bucket.
-They're Luggable Loos. They work great.

34:36.125 --> 34:37.750
-They're luggable what?
-A Luggable Loo.

34:37.833 --> 34:39.541
Dude, you just grab it, pump, dump,

of the road, whatever.

the sweat lodge fired up, all right?

34:43.458 --> 34:46.083
Good luck out there, all right?
Now watch out for the rattlesnakes.

34:46.166 --> 34:48.125

-They're edible, but they're dangerous.

34:48.208 --> 34:49.416

35:51.208 --> 35:54.541
Yo, stop.
No, stop. That tickles.

35:54.625 --> 35:58.291
You got some claws on you, huh?
You still cute though.

36:06.625 --> 36:07.750
Look at you.

36:12.958 --> 36:14.500

Is this what you want?

I'll set… I'll set it down

-Hey! Shit! I got a lion on my ass!

37:03.083 --> 37:05.583
-Help! Help!

You went primal, man.

38:12.250 --> 38:13.250
Yes, I did.

38:14.166 --> 38:15.041
Yes, I did.

38:15.125 --> 38:20.250
You know what? She might be the big cat,
but I'm looking at the Big Dog.

38:20.750 --> 38:23.833
-This is the Big Dog. You are the Big Dog.
-Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah.

38:25.583 --> 38:26.416
You hear that?

38:27.958 --> 38:32.333
I'm the Big Dog!

38:32.416 --> 38:35.416
-Oh my God.

38:35.500 --> 38:36.583
I'm the Big Dog!

38:36.666 --> 38:38.000
-Sonny, calm down.
-Huh?

38:38.083 --> 38:39.958
You got… you got
a little blood on your back.

38:40.041 --> 38:42.000
What do you mean? Did she clip me?

38:42.083 --> 38:44.208
-She clipped me a little bit?

38:44.291 --> 38:45.375
Damn.

38:45.458 --> 38:47.125
I got a little bit of Neosporin.

38:47.208 --> 38:49.166
-Just put this on there.
-Oh, no.

38:49.250 --> 38:50.541
I don't know if it's gonna do it.

38:50.625 --> 38:52.375
-Take a picture. Lemme look at it.
-You sure?

38:52.458 --> 38:55.583
Yeah. I gotta see it, 'cause Neosporin,
you normally put a little bit on top.

38:55.666 --> 38:57.416
That hardens it up.
Goes away the next day.

38:57.500 --> 38:59.750
-Take a look at this.
-Yeah, let me see it. What--

39:04.166 --> 39:07.583
-Oh, she tried to take my spine out.
-You gotta breathe. You gotta breathe.

39:07.666 --> 39:09.791
This was a… this was a planned attack.

39:10.291 --> 39:12.416
Sonny. He's not okay!

39:12.500 --> 39:14.125
-Guys! Calm down.
-Sonny?

39:14.208 --> 39:15.666
We're gonna get him to the campsite.

39:15.750 --> 39:18.833
-Yeah. We got you, Sonny.
-We're gonna bandage it up, okay?

39:18.916 --> 39:21.666
-Just breathe. Oh, he's out.
-Okay.

39:21.750 --> 39:22.750
-Oh my God!

39:30.208 --> 39:32.041
The raw bar has arrived.

39:48.250 --> 39:51.166
Shot of "to-kill-ya," Big Dog?

39:55.083 --> 39:56.250
Let's go!

40:06.041 --> 40:07.958
-To the Big Dog!

40:24.541 --> 40:28.208
One, two, three, and slide.

40:28.291 --> 40:30.000
Great. Okay, it's your turn.

40:30.083 --> 40:31.416
No, it's my turn.

40:31.500 --> 40:34.041
Okay, go ahead.
Oh, wait, it's your dad. Hi!

40:34.125 --> 40:36.958
Hey. I wanted to call you guys,

40:37.041 --> 40:39.333
check on you,
see how things were going, honey.

40:39.416 --> 40:42.041
Actually, it's been great.
We had such a fun day. How about you?

40:42.125 --> 40:43.625
-I'm good.
-It's Sonny.

40:43.708 --> 40:46.291
Good is an understatement,
'cause I ended up coming to Huck's party.

40:46.375 --> 40:49.250
That is fantastic, babe. I'm glad.

40:49.333 --> 40:51.375
We're in the desert, getting primal.

40:51.458 --> 40:52.291
-Oh?

40:52.375 --> 40:55.208
I even got myself a nickname out here.
They call me the Big Dog.

40:55.291 --> 40:57.916
-Well, I know what that means.
-Big Dog!

40:58.000 --> 40:58.958
And it's sticking.

40:59.041 --> 41:01.625
-Baby, I'm--
-Dad!

41:01.708 --> 41:04.875
-You been practicing for the show?
-No, better.

41:04.958 --> 41:06.833
We took a seaplane ride!

41:06.916 --> 41:09.041
-It was so fun!
-Okay. Okay--

41:09.125 --> 41:12.583
Mom's friend Armando
flew us to his private island.

41:12.666 --> 41:14.791
Back up a little bit.
Sounded like you said, "Armando."

41:14.875 --> 41:18.000
Do me a favor, put your mother
on the phone. Let me talk to your mom.

41:18.083 --> 41:19.250
-Hi, honey.
-Hey.

41:19.333 --> 41:21.750
You didn't say nothing to me
about Armando coming out there.

41:21.833 --> 41:24.958
Baby, I didn't know he was coming up here.
How would I know? He just showed up.

41:25.041 --> 41:28.708
He wanted my opinion on this island
that he's thinking of buying.

41:28.791 --> 41:31.541
And Mom's gonna design
a tortoise sanctuary for him.

41:31.625 --> 41:33.708
What are you talking about?
What does that mean?

41:33.791 --> 41:36.583
Well, I was gonna call you
about it after I put the kids to bed.

41:36.666 --> 41:38.583
He just suggested that I leave my job

41:38.666 --> 41:43.750
and… and open my own firm,
you know, uh, with him as my first client.

41:43.833 --> 41:45.166
Oh! Oh, there you go.

41:45.250 --> 41:46.833
Last suggestion I remember

41:46.916 --> 41:49.333
was you telling me that you
wanted to spend time with the kids.

41:49.416 --> 41:51.375
Now I find out that you're island hopping

41:51.458 --> 41:52.875
-with old Don Dental…
-Please.

41:52.958 --> 41:54.833
-Be nice.
-…going all over the place--

41:54.916 --> 41:57.250
-Sonny, it's Gil.
-Oh shit.

41:57.333 --> 41:59.541
-You have to understand something.
-Here we go.

41:59.625 --> 42:01.125
Maya is the breadwinner,

42:01.208 --> 42:03.291
and your job
is to hold down the home front.

42:03.375 --> 42:06.250
Now, I love you, buddy,
but you got to stay in your lane.

42:06.333 --> 42:09.416
You know what, Gil? I doubt
that I'm gonna take relationship advice,

42:09.500 --> 42:12.125
or any type of advice
for that matter, from a cheater.

42:12.208 --> 42:13.916
-What?
-That's right. From a cheater!

42:14.000 --> 42:15.500
-What?
-Who did Grandpa cheat with?

42:15.583 --> 42:17.625
I have never cheated in my life!

42:17.708 --> 42:19.458
Want me to take you
back to last summer, huh?

42:19.541 --> 42:20.875
Orcas Island Golf Course?

42:20.958 --> 42:23.291
You gave yourself
every putt within six feet.

42:23.375 --> 42:26.291
-He's talking about golf. So dumb.
-Newsflash, those are not gimmes!

42:26.375 --> 42:27.583
They're not gimmes, Pops!

42:27.666 --> 42:32.083
It's not my fault you don't have the balls
to tell me to putt out, you pussy.

42:32.166 --> 42:34.291
-Oh, I don't have the balls?
-Okay, Maya--

42:34.375 --> 42:36.875
-Okay.
-Let me tell you something about my balls!

42:36.958 --> 42:40.291
Let me tell you something
about my big black balls.

42:40.375 --> 42:43.166
-I'm out. Take the phone, girl.
-I fought off a mountain lion!

42:43.250 --> 42:46.166
You're not done 'cause I'm not done,
so pick up the phone. Gil?

42:46.250 --> 42:50.875
-We're gonna tell you good night, honey.
-Maya, give Gil back the phone!

42:57.708 --> 42:59.000
You don't have no balls.

43:04.416 --> 43:05.250
Hey, Sonny.

43:06.041 --> 43:07.166
Where you been, buddy?

43:07.666 --> 43:09.208
I was up there on the phone with Maya.

43:09.291 --> 43:10.958
-I had to go find reception.
-Really?

43:11.041 --> 43:12.666
I call to check on her.

43:12.750 --> 43:14.916
I'm thinking she's with the kids,
spending quality time.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.250
She's with her parents,
what she was supposed to be doing.

43:17.333 --> 43:18.916
I find out her client Armando's there.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.708
I find that out 'cause Dash told me.

43:20.791 --> 43:22.916
And her dad called me a pussy.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.041
-Whoa. None of that right now.
-I never-- I'm not a pussy. I'm--

43:26.125 --> 43:27.000
Just calm down.

43:27.083 --> 43:28.875
-Yeah, I--
-Take a breath. Recenter.

43:28.958 --> 43:30.416
-Yeah.
-You're not with Maya.

43:30.500 --> 43:32.041
-You're not with the kids.
-Yeah.

43:32.125 --> 43:35.041
-You're here in the desert with me.
-Yeah.

43:36.750 --> 43:39.666
There you go. Recenter.

43:40.291 --> 43:41.416
Oh, hell, yes.

43:41.500 --> 43:43.208
Sonny, you're gonna lose your mind

43:43.291 --> 43:45.416
when you see the surprise guest
I pulled out of a hat.

43:45.500 --> 43:48.041
-You got a surprise guest?
-I got a surprise guest.

43:48.125 --> 43:50.875
For you. They're a little early,
but you're gonna love it.

43:50.958 --> 43:52.875
-Who is it? Tell me.
-You're gonna love it.

43:55.625 --> 43:56.666
Ay-yi-yi.

43:56.750 --> 44:00.000
Huck, my man. I texted you.
You've been ghosting me.

44:00.083 --> 44:03.541
No! No, I've just been slammed
planning this party. It's my 44th.

44:03.625 --> 44:06.958
Not to burst your bubble,
but that's not a milestone of any kind.

44:07.041 --> 44:09.666
And if it wasn't for your friend here
posting you on the 'gram,

44:09.750 --> 44:11.750
I would've never found out
where you were hiding.

44:11.833 --> 44:13.333
I would not hide from you.

44:13.416 --> 44:16.208
Wait a minute, am I missing something?
Is this the surprise?

44:16.291 --> 44:17.875
Allow me to do the intros.

44:17.958 --> 44:20.291
Stan Berman,
alternative revenue specialist.

44:20.375 --> 44:23.666
-And this is my colleague, Dorit.
-Shalom.

44:23.750 --> 44:26.833
Shalom back at you. I'm, uh, Sonny Fisher.

44:26.916 --> 44:30.416
So, Huck, when I saw
you were throwing this elaborate shindig

44:30.500 --> 44:33.291
even though you still owe me $47,000,

44:33.375 --> 44:35.791
I thought Dorit and I
will have to come pay you a visit.

44:35.875 --> 44:38.416
No, I-- Look, I've been having
some liquidity issues.

44:38.500 --> 44:39.833
Stan offered to spot me.

44:39.916 --> 44:40.791
-It's all good.
-Okay.

44:40.875 --> 44:42.541
I didn't spot you, Huck.

44:42.625 --> 44:46.125
I loaned you the money,
and you refused to pay me back.

44:46.208 --> 44:50.208
So now, Dorit's gonna have to inflict
some bodily harm.

44:50.291 --> 44:54.083
Stan. Stan. Stan the Man.
Hey, I thought we were friends.

44:54.166 --> 44:57.833
We are, but Huck, I was very clear
about my fee structure.

44:57.916 --> 45:01.333
It's a misunderstanding.
I did not know this was so time-sensitive.

45:01.416 --> 45:03.750
Give me a day.
I'll move some funds around.

45:03.833 --> 45:04.750
I'll pay you back.

45:04.833 --> 45:06.041
Oy vey.

45:06.125 --> 45:07.875
-A day?
-Yeah.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
All right, fine.

45:10.083 --> 45:11.583
-Oh my God.
-Yes, thank you!

45:11.666 --> 45:13.708
-He's so reasonable.
-I didn't know what was going on.

45:13.791 --> 45:15.750
-I'm panicking right now.
-Don't sever anything.

45:15.833 --> 45:17.666
Just break a finger,
then we gotta hit the road.

45:17.750 --> 45:20.541
Wait, what are you talking about?
We had a deal. You gave me a day.

45:20.625 --> 45:22.708
You just said that it was okay.
We heard you say that.

45:22.791 --> 45:25.833
But, Huck, would you really feel
the pressure to pay me back

45:25.916 --> 45:27.583
without some physical violence?

45:27.666 --> 45:29.750
-I wouldn't with the same immediacy.
-That's my point.

45:29.833 --> 45:32.625
You guys are in good hands.
Don't worry, Dorit's incredibly precise.

45:32.708 --> 45:34.666
Fingers on the wood, please.

45:34.750 --> 45:36.250
Huck, wait… wait a minute.

45:36.333 --> 45:38.083
-Don't put your hand there.
-She said I have--

45:38.166 --> 45:40.750
-Here we--
-Hey, listen, D… Do… What… what is it?

45:40.833 --> 45:44.500
It's Dorit. Like "Dorito" without the "o."
Come on, man, pull it together.

45:44.583 --> 45:46.958
Hey! Don't! Wait! He's gonna say
something important, I think.

45:47.041 --> 45:48.916
-Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
-What?

45:49.000 --> 45:50.958
I can't let this happen
because I feel responsible.

45:51.041 --> 45:54.875
No, Sonny, this is not your fault.
I'm not letting you take responsibility.

45:54.958 --> 45:56.875
You're the responsible party?

45:56.958 --> 46:00.333
Yes, my picture is what brought you here.

46:01.375 --> 46:02.458
-Okay.
-Yes!

46:02.541 --> 46:04.416
-Dorit. Oh, I love you! Thank you.
-Thank you.

46:04.500 --> 46:06.916
You're so sweet.
I told you she was really nice.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.666
Way more understanding than him.

46:11.458 --> 46:12.625
Oh my God!

46:12.708 --> 46:15.250
-Whoa! Why is the little one screaming?

46:15.333 --> 46:17.000
He said he was responsible.

46:17.083 --> 46:19.750
I said I was responsible
for bringing you here, Diggit.

46:19.833 --> 46:20.916
Dorit! Dorit!

46:21.000 --> 46:22.541
"Dorit." I don't give a shit!

46:22.625 --> 46:23.458
Damn!

46:23.541 --> 46:25.875
Dorit, you have to run these things by me.

46:25.958 --> 46:27.333
He said responsible!

46:27.416 --> 46:30.583
Oh my God. That is disgusting.
It looks like a hot Cheeto.

46:30.666 --> 46:35.416
I am so sorry, Sonny, but look,
we got a finger, right? We're good.

46:35.500 --> 46:38.125
Dorit, would you please
go burn down the campsite?

46:38.208 --> 46:40.208
-Or do you want me to supervise that too?
-What?

46:40.291 --> 46:42.833
You said you got your finger.
Why you gonna burn down the campsite?

46:42.916 --> 46:45.416
Huck, you built
a massive effigy of yourself

46:45.500 --> 46:46.916
while you're deeply indebted to me.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.083
How do you think
that reflects on my business?

46:49.791 --> 46:51.041
The party's over buddy, okay?

46:51.125 --> 46:53.000
Just get your stuff together
and pay me back.

46:53.083 --> 46:55.250
-Oh my God, Huck.
-She's not really gonna do that.

46:55.333 --> 46:56.708
I'm sorry again, Sonny.

46:56.791 --> 46:59.916
I promise you, Dorit's a delight
when you get to know her.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.416
We're trying to party!

47:01.500 --> 47:02.791
-Oh!
-Ooh.

47:02.875 --> 47:05.833
-Party's over! Go home!
-No, not the effigy!

47:07.625 --> 47:09.791
We weren't gonna burn that till Thursday!

47:10.916 --> 47:13.625
Everybody stay calm… but run!

47:14.250 --> 47:16.000
Don't worry. Hey! Hey!

47:16.083 --> 47:18.791
Now you owe me $47,000 and an iPhone.

47:19.416 --> 47:20.625
What?

47:21.666 --> 47:22.791
Hey, guys.

47:23.875 --> 47:24.916
I'm so sorry.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.791
This is a bit of a misunderstanding.
Actually, it's a bookkeeping issue really.

47:29.333 --> 47:31.625
Clearly, this is not
how I wanted the week to end.

47:32.291 --> 47:34.375
Geno will get you safely back to LA.

47:34.458 --> 47:35.291
Next time.

47:35.375 --> 47:37.041
-We had fun.
-Thank you.

47:37.125 --> 47:39.166
-It's nothing.
-We'll party next weekend.

47:39.250 --> 47:41.833
You said Geno
will get you safely back to LA.

47:42.583 --> 47:44.125
-You're not coming?
-All right.

47:44.208 --> 47:46.750
No, I should see
if there's anything salvageable.

47:46.833 --> 47:48.083
I'll just call an Uber.

47:49.500 --> 47:51.125
Party was still fire, brother.

47:51.208 --> 47:53.250
Not the best time to use the word "fire."

47:53.333 --> 47:55.791
-I just meant like--
-I understand the sentiment.

47:56.958 --> 47:57.875
Bye, Huck!

47:58.375 --> 48:01.166
If you want, man, I don't…
I don't mind sticking around

48:01.250 --> 48:03.833
and… and helping you
look through all this stuff.

48:03.916 --> 48:06.833
No, no, Sonny, you've done enough.
I feel horrible about your finger.

48:06.916 --> 48:08.916
Come on. You tell me…
you tell me where to go.

48:09.500 --> 48:11.000
We could start-- You wanna start here?

48:11.083 --> 48:13.833
You wanna start with the stuff
that's not still on fire, maybe?

48:13.916 --> 48:15.208
Maybe still smoking?

48:16.333 --> 48:17.250
Bye, guys!

48:18.041 --> 48:20.625
Oh my God.

48:21.416 --> 48:24.333
My YETIs melted.
That's 2,500 I'll never get back.

48:24.833 --> 48:26.875
You spent 2,500 on coolers, Huck?

48:27.708 --> 48:30.125
Why would you spend that
on coolers when you're in the hole?

48:30.208 --> 48:31.916
I don't know what's wrong with me.

48:32.541 --> 48:34.708
It's much bigger than YETIs,
I can tell you that.

48:34.791 --> 48:37.500
The truth is,
I didn't leave the ad agency, Sonny.

48:37.583 --> 48:38.416
I got fired.

48:38.916 --> 48:40.833
-You got what?
-I got fired.

48:40.916 --> 48:42.125
I take a client out to dinner,

48:42.208 --> 48:45.166
somehow, we'd end up
on a bender in San Miguel de Allende.

48:45.708 --> 48:47.833
HR caught on and was like,
"Ah, no. Hello!"

48:47.916 --> 48:50.416
They don't wanna pay $17,000 for a dinner.

48:52.333 --> 48:55.250
I tried to start my own firm,
but I couldn't even get past QuickBooks.

48:55.333 --> 48:57.666
I spiraled.
These parties got out of control.

48:57.750 --> 48:59.958
It was an attempt
to stave off my loneliness.

49:00.041 --> 49:01.958
If you needed help,
why didn't you just call me?

49:02.041 --> 49:04.458
I did. I called. I texted you.

49:04.541 --> 49:06.291
Every time I hit you up,
you just blew me off.

49:06.375 --> 49:10.041
And I get it, all right? I took the hint.
You're onto this beautiful new chapter.

49:10.125 --> 49:13.125
There was no time for me
getting in the way. I understand.

49:13.208 --> 49:14.791
No, no, Huck.

49:14.875 --> 49:17.500
You would call me
at eleven o'clock at night to go out.

49:17.583 --> 49:19.000
I'm in bed by nine.

49:19.083 --> 49:20.666
And not to mention, if I do go out,

49:20.750 --> 49:23.666
what am I gonna talk about
with a… a… a beekeeper?

49:23.750 --> 49:26.333
That's not my world.
I build Legos, I wipe ass.

49:26.416 --> 49:28.041
Sonny, you're crushing it.

49:28.125 --> 49:31.083
You support a brilliant woman.
You raised two amazing kids.

49:31.166 --> 49:33.250
Anyone would kill for your life.

49:35.000 --> 49:35.833
You wouldn't.

49:36.375 --> 49:37.416
Are you kidding me?

49:38.125 --> 49:38.958
That's my dream.

49:39.916 --> 49:41.833
I'm just on more of a Clooney plan.

49:41.916 --> 49:43.583
What does that… what does that mean?

49:43.666 --> 49:47.041
George Timothy Clooney?
The world's most eligible bachelor?

49:47.125 --> 49:49.291
The guy rode singledom into his 50s.

49:49.375 --> 49:51.208
Then he married Amal, had the twins,

49:51.291 --> 49:53.500
became a family man
without ever missing a beat.

49:54.125 --> 49:56.500
-The Clooney plan.
-No, I get it. I understand.

49:56.583 --> 49:59.041
Look, I'm sorry that I blew you off, man.

49:59.791 --> 50:02.500
I am. And I… and I hate
that it took this long to talk.

50:03.000 --> 50:03.833
Right?

50:03.916 --> 50:05.458
It's okay. We're talking now.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.250
You're my best friend.

50:07.750 --> 50:09.166
Water under the bridge.

50:09.250 --> 50:10.125
Yeah.

50:12.833 --> 50:14.791
Water under the bridge. You're right.

50:14.875 --> 50:15.833
I'm sorry, man.

50:16.416 --> 50:17.625
-Oh my God.
-What?

50:18.458 --> 50:19.916
The raw bar, untouched.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.250
Sonny, this is a sign.

50:22.333 --> 50:23.833
-Things are looking up.
-What do you--

50:23.916 --> 50:25.500
Let's bag these up and get out of here.

50:25.583 --> 50:27.583
No way I'm leaving
four grand of shellfish behind.

50:27.666 --> 50:29.375
You spent four grand on shellfish?

50:30.541 --> 50:33.166
Oh my God. It stinks in here.

50:33.250 --> 50:36.083
I never would've picked you guys up
if I knew y'all were moving mollusks.

50:36.166 --> 50:39.791
I'm so sorry, Thelma, but it was like
God himself told me to take these oysters.

50:39.875 --> 50:41.958
-You gotta be kidding me.
-What?

50:43.166 --> 50:44.833
Topanga, the next exit coming up.

50:44.916 --> 50:46.208
It's Armando's.

50:46.291 --> 50:49.250
That's where
the old Toothbrush King himself lives.

50:49.333 --> 50:51.500
-It's this chess match that he and I got.
-Of course.

50:51.583 --> 50:54.500
-I make a move, he--
-I gotta get eyes on this guy.

50:54.583 --> 50:56.166
-On Armando?
-Let me see him.

50:57.458 --> 50:58.500
All right.

50:59.375 --> 51:03.458
-Oh my God. Dude, he's stunning.
-Pass the phone. Let me see.

51:03.541 --> 51:05.708
-I don't think-- Huck!

51:05.791 --> 51:07.791
-I want a woman's perspective.
-Oh my God.

51:07.875 --> 51:09.791
-Would you hit that?
-Yeah, twice on Sunday.

51:09.875 --> 51:12.750
Okay, that's enough.
Please. Give me my pho--

51:12.833 --> 51:16.875
-Did you just like the picture?
-Gorgeous.

51:16.958 --> 51:20.875
-Sonny, these moguls, they're predators.
-What?

51:20.958 --> 51:23.125
He's going after your family.
You gotta go after his.

51:23.208 --> 51:25.583
-Well--
-Does he have a wife? A girlfriend?

51:25.666 --> 51:26.750
I'd be down. I mean, what?

51:26.833 --> 51:28.875
I'd hate to be a home-wrecker,
but I'll do it for you.

51:28.958 --> 51:30.875
-Okay.
-You give me a week, I'll seduce her.

51:32.875 --> 51:33.833
You know what?

51:35.583 --> 51:36.500
He does.

51:38.125 --> 51:39.916
-Hey, get off at this exit.
-Right here?

51:40.000 --> 51:41.208
Right here. Get off.

51:41.291 --> 51:44.291
-Hey! Ever hear of a blinker. Huh?

51:46.625 --> 51:49.666
Bro, I've done
a lot of stupid stuff in my time,

51:49.750 --> 51:51.375
but there's no way I'm fucking a tortoise.

51:51.458 --> 51:55.666
-You just said you'd fuck a tortoise?
-No, I'm not asking you to do that, Huck.

51:55.750 --> 51:58.083
The guy refers to these things
as his family.

51:58.166 --> 52:01.583
Right? So what I'm thinking,
I'm thinking we grab it, set it free.

52:01.666 --> 52:03.666
Let it outside the gate, right?

52:03.750 --> 52:05.458
By the time Armando
gets back from San Juan,

52:05.541 --> 52:06.666
this thing could be anywhere.

52:06.750 --> 52:09.333
-Yeah, he's gonna be devastated.
-He's gonna be pissed off.

52:09.416 --> 52:12.250
These tortoises are a lot heavier
than what you think they are.

52:12.333 --> 52:14.458
-We have one.
-When did you get a tortoise?

52:14.541 --> 52:16.958
Well, basically the kids' preschool,

52:17.041 --> 52:19.000
they made us take one
for the summer, right?

52:19.083 --> 52:21.416
Kids fell in love with it.
I don't even understand how.

52:21.500 --> 52:22.750
They're so emotionless.

52:22.833 --> 52:25.375
It's, like, not a good pet at all.
They don't respond.

52:25.458 --> 52:27.000
They don't really do anything.

52:27.500 --> 52:29.583
There you go.
The world is yours. Go, buddy.

52:29.666 --> 52:32.000
-Yeah, he's getting some momentum now.
-Yeah, he is.

52:32.083 --> 52:34.333
-This is so stupid.
-Go. Hee-yah!

52:38.708 --> 52:40.458
I gotta be honest,
I'm having second thoughts.

52:40.541 --> 52:43.583
I just had a visual
of this guy crossing the 405, and he…

52:43.666 --> 52:44.750
he don't stand a chance.

52:44.833 --> 52:46.083
-Oh, thank God.
-Yeah.

52:46.166 --> 52:47.583
God, I was feeling the same thing,

52:47.666 --> 52:49.541
but you were on a roll,
so I kept my mouth shut.

52:49.625 --> 52:54.041
I like the feeling of knowing
that we could have did this to Armando.

52:54.125 --> 52:56.000
-Wait, wait, wait, put him down.
-What?

52:56.083 --> 52:57.750
-Hold on a second here.
-What?

52:57.833 --> 53:00.833
What? I'm talking
to the Big Dog right now.

53:00.916 --> 53:04.250
If we can't tear apart his family,
we may as well mess with his house, right?

53:04.875 --> 53:05.791
Huck, wait, hold on--

53:05.875 --> 53:07.958
-Are you the Big Dog?
-Yeah, I'm the Big Dog.

53:08.041 --> 53:10.416
-C'mon, don't be a little bitch.
-I'm not a bitch.

53:10.500 --> 53:12.166
-Let her hear the Big Dog.
-I'm the Big Dog!

53:14.750 --> 53:16.000
Is that the Big Dog?

53:17.416 --> 53:19.833
Oh, yeah. He's ready.

-This is good stuff.
-Dump it.

53:28.833 --> 53:32.041
You can't dump this one. You gotta grind--
This is gonna take forever.

53:33.208 --> 53:35.041

-Yeah.

54:06.791 --> 54:07.625
A deuce!

54:07.708 --> 54:09.041
-Okay.
-A hot one, a steamer.

54:09.125 --> 54:11.125
Yeah. I gotta muster it up,
but I'll do it.

54:14.791 --> 54:16.416
Why don't you shit his bed instead?

54:16.958 --> 54:19.541
It's a great pivot.
You've always been an idea man, Huck.

-What?
-Look, Stan's a bad dude.

55:30.208 --> 55:33.833
He's called The Butcher of Beverly Hills.
I heard he dumps bodies at the marina.

55:33.916 --> 55:36.666
-Huck, that's insane.

55:36.750 --> 55:38.791

I feel like Butch and Sundance
just got back together.

55:48.500 --> 55:51.041
We had one last day together.
It was the greatest day of my life.

55:51.125 --> 55:53.666
The day doesn't have to be over.
We can keep the party going.

55:53.750 --> 55:57.541
Sonny, it's over. I'm couch surfing.
There's no place to move the party to.

55:59.166 --> 56:00.583
Okay, what if there was a place?

56:00.666 --> 56:02.541
-No.
-No. Call Geno.

56:02.625 --> 56:06.416

this party's gonna be epic…

56:22.291 --> 56:23.625
-Yeah.
-…it's gonna be epic.

56:23.708 --> 56:26.166
We're gonna send you out
with a bang, Huck. Watch.

56:26.250 --> 56:28.416
-With a big bang.

56:28.500 --> 56:31.125
-What the heck are you banging?
-Get out of the car right now!

56:31.208 --> 56:32.583
You're gonna wanna see this.

56:32.666 --> 56:36.041
-We said we'll pay. What is your problem?
-Look… look down!

56:36.125 --> 56:39.250
-Oh my God. Is it dead?
-I don't know.

56:39.333 --> 56:41.166
This is so bad.
It could've been 100 years old!

56:41.250 --> 56:44.000
-Oh my God!
-Isn't that, like, bad karma?

56:44.083 --> 56:46.000
-It blinked. It blinked!
-What?

56:46.083 --> 56:47.583
-You saw it blink?
-It's blinking now.

56:47.666 --> 56:48.583
Oh, hi.

56:48.666 --> 56:51.541
Listen, if it's blinking, that means
we got time to do the right thing.

56:51.625 --> 56:54.875
All we gotta do is get it in the car,
get it to the animal hospital. That's it

56:54.958 --> 56:59.791
No, we are not putting
that mangled beast in my new Nissan.

56:59.875 --> 57:01.000
Thelma, be reasonable.

57:01.083 --> 57:04.458
Can one injured turtle smell any worse
than 200 Littlenecks in your trunk?

57:04.541 --> 57:07.666
Why are we not focusing on the problem?
Right now, it's not about you.

57:07.750 --> 57:08.875
Why are you in my face?

57:08.958 --> 57:10.958
-Hey! Hey!
-You just shoved the Big Dog?

57:11.041 --> 57:13.875
-What Big Dog, you little chihuahua?
-He's a bigger dog than you.

57:13.958 --> 57:16.208
Woof, woof, bitch. That's how you bark!

57:16.291 --> 57:18.583
-We don't have the time. Come on.
-Load it up!

57:18.666 --> 57:19.833
Get the turtle!

57:19.916 --> 57:21.458
Make yourself-- Get your ass in the car!

57:21.541 --> 57:23.416
-Make yourself useful.
-Don't tell me what to do!

57:24.416 --> 57:25.250
God.

57:25.333 --> 57:27.000
-Let's go!

57:27.083 --> 57:28.708
Oh my God. Be careful!

57:28.791 --> 57:31.791
-Shut up! You don't think we know?
-Obviously you don't.

57:31.875 --> 57:33.583
Okay, what does it say to do?

57:33.666 --> 57:34.583
Cover the mouth.

57:34.666 --> 57:38.583
Blow through the nose as hard as you can.
Wrap your lips around it.

57:38.666 --> 57:39.666
Look at the picture!

57:39.750 --> 57:41.708
He's fighting it.
He's not letting it go down.

57:41.791 --> 57:45.166
I got it. I got it.

57:45.250 --> 57:47.125
-Yes. Yes!

57:47.208 --> 57:48.708
-More mouth.

57:48.791 --> 57:50.791
I got turtle boogie.
I didn't know they had boogies.

57:50.875 --> 57:51.791
Oh my God.

57:51.875 --> 57:52.875
I got something in there.

57:52.958 --> 57:54.750
-That is disgusting.
-Wake up!

57:54.833 --> 57:57.333
Don't flick him! You have to gently grasp.

57:58.416 --> 58:00.708
Cover his mouth and blow

58:00.791 --> 58:03.208
slow, steady breaths into his nostril.

58:05.500 --> 58:07.666
-We're here, fools.
-Wait. Wait. What?

58:07.750 --> 58:10.000
-Stop! Stop! I said don't. I said do not.
-Got it.

58:10.083 --> 58:12.333
Come on. Car, car, car.

58:12.416 --> 58:15.625
-Slow down! We got an injured turtle here.

58:18.583 --> 58:19.916
-Hey, you got it?
-I got it.

58:21.958 --> 58:25.041
Let's go, you idiots!

58:27.625 --> 58:28.750
Hold on. Hold on. Wait, wait.

58:28.833 --> 58:30.166
-Wait, wait, wait
-What?

58:30.916 --> 58:33.583
Goddamn it. Did you do this?

58:35.000 --> 58:36.916
-No.
-Who did it?

58:37.625 --> 58:39.416
Armando Zavala! Go!

58:39.500 --> 58:41.375
Get him inside
before he dies, stupid.

58:41.458 --> 58:42.541
Get it inside!

58:42.625 --> 58:45.416
Watch this. You think
Armando's gonna miss all his left shoes?

58:45.500 --> 58:47.125
That's so genius, Huck.

58:47.958 --> 58:51.791
You got to strike while the iron's hot.
Now, you got your little nest egg.

58:51.875 --> 58:55.500
-You got your first client.
-Yes, but I need to talk to Sonny first.

58:55.583 --> 58:58.250
He'll figure it out, now.
I don't see any issues.

58:58.333 --> 59:00.875
-Oh, well, except the big issue.
-Which is?

59:00.958 --> 59:04.000
Well, I barely see Dash and Ava as it is.

59:04.083 --> 59:07.291
If I start my own firm,
I'm never gonna be home.

59:07.375 --> 59:10.500
If you want to be away from the kids
more than you already are,

59:11.458 --> 59:12.750
I think you know the answer.

59:12.833 --> 59:15.458
Here we go.
Thank you, Mom, for yet another reminder…

59:15.541 --> 59:17.750
-No, I--
-…of what a neglectful mother I am.

59:18.708 --> 59:21.375
Honey, I'm jealous.

59:22.250 --> 59:23.500
I am jealous of you

59:23.583 --> 59:26.500
because you have a partner
who helps you live your dreams.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
What is that supposed to mean, baby?

59:29.083 --> 59:32.500
-You never helped me with these kids.
-You oughta stop.

59:32.583 --> 59:36.250
I have a half-written erotic novel
that I never finished.

59:36.333 --> 59:37.708
An erotic novel?

59:37.791 --> 59:40.875
-It's very sexual.
-How is that my fault?

59:40.958 --> 59:46.208
Do you know how hard it is to write about
a man grabbing a woman by the titties…

59:46.291 --> 59:49.083
-Oh God, Mom!
-…knee-deep in dirty diapers?

59:49.166 --> 59:53.541
Guys, this conversation has taken
a really uncomfortable and crazy turn,

59:53.625 --> 59:56.875
but Mom, I do think I understand
where you're coming from.

59:56.958 --> 59:57.833
Oh, thank you.

59:57.916 --> 1:00:01.166
You know, the truth is,
if… if I were a dad making this decision,

1:00:01.250 --> 1:00:03.708
-this wouldn't even be a conversation.
-Mm-hmm.

1:00:03.791 --> 1:00:07.583
And Sonny and I, what we do,
we make a great team.

1:00:07.666 --> 1:00:08.833
I give you that.

1:00:08.916 --> 1:00:10.083
I can do this.

1:00:10.166 --> 1:00:11.166
Yes, you can.

1:00:11.250 --> 1:00:14.000
Look, it's Armando.

1:00:14.083 --> 1:00:18.708
Armando, your ears must have been ringing.
I literally just said your name.

1:00:18.791 --> 1:00:21.208
-Armando?

1:00:21.291 --> 1:00:22.708
Sonny ran over Ole Snappy.

1:00:22.791 --> 1:00:25.208
-Wait, wait! Sonny did what?
-What'd Sonny do?

1:00:25.291 --> 1:00:28.666
-Sonny just ran over Ole Snappy.
-Who the hell is Ole Snappy?

1:00:28.750 --> 1:00:32.541
-I don't know. Who's Ole Snappy?
-It's Armando's oldest tortoise.

1:00:32.625 --> 1:00:35.375
Are they gonna put him in jail for this?
Can you see him now?

1:00:35.458 --> 1:00:37.666
-He'd never be able to get a job.
-Turtle killer.

1:00:37.750 --> 1:00:38.583
Mmm.

1:00:50.500 --> 1:00:53.666
-Hey, Thelma, we're a no-shoe household.
-That's so dumb.

1:00:57.291 --> 1:00:58.708
Huck, who are all these people?

1:00:59.333 --> 1:01:01.416
Oh, dude, I put
the bat call out on Instagram.

1:01:01.500 --> 1:01:04.166
Seems like you have a nice little turnout.
You get settled, all right?

1:01:04.250 --> 1:01:06.333
-Wait, wait
-Put these bad boys on ice. We'll be good.

1:01:06.416 --> 1:01:09.416
-I thought it was just--
-Hey, the Big Dog is in the house!

1:01:09.500 --> 1:01:11.708
-Hey, what's up, man?
-What's popping, bro?

1:01:11.791 --> 1:01:14.583
Hey, I got Huck's texts,
cordoned off all your kids' rooms

1:01:14.666 --> 1:01:17.041
and made a sign
telling everybody to remove they shoes.

1:01:17.125 --> 1:01:17.958
Yeah.

1:01:18.041 --> 1:01:22.166
But look, your TV
was paused on some '90s porn.

1:01:22.250 --> 1:01:23.708
I watched a little bit of it,

1:01:23.791 --> 1:01:25.916
but it was so nice
that it had an actual plot.

1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:27.166
-Okay.
-Sonny!

1:01:27.750 --> 1:01:29.958
-Hey.
-Alan?

1:01:30.041 --> 1:01:31.916
-Alan, what are you doing here, man?

1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:33.791
I followed
your boy Huck on Instagram.

1:01:33.875 --> 1:01:36.166
I saw the party moved to your place,
so I had to get here.

1:01:36.250 --> 1:01:39.291
-The magnetic pull was far too strong.
-You drove from Legoland?

1:01:39.375 --> 1:01:41.125
Rita's a deep sleeper.
She'll never know I'm gone.

1:01:41.208 --> 1:01:43.833
The kids'll be up in the morning,
but I'll be back by then. I hope.

1:01:44.666 --> 1:01:46.958
I'm just gonna ask, is that cocaine, man?

1:01:47.041 --> 1:01:49.208
What do you think this is,
Grand Theft Auto?

1:01:49.291 --> 1:01:50.875
No, this is my son's ADHD medication.

1:01:50.958 --> 1:01:52.250
How much of that have you done?

1:01:52.333 --> 1:01:55.500
A pretty good amount if I'm being honest.
I've done this before. Not my first time.

1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:57.833
-This is my first time.
-Okay.

1:01:57.916 --> 1:01:59.375
-What you gonna do?

1:01:59.458 --> 1:02:01.875
I've been lying to myself,
Sonny, for far too long.

1:02:01.958 --> 1:02:03.916
You know? I… I… I do everything.

1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:06.125
You know, Rita,
she just bosses me around all the time.

1:02:06.208 --> 1:02:08.125
I'm never alone.
I'm not going back to Legoland.

1:02:08.208 --> 1:02:10.041
-I don't have to go back.
-I didn't say you did.

1:02:10.125 --> 1:02:11.708
I'm not gonna 'cause I don't have to go.

1:02:11.791 --> 1:02:13.666
-Okay.
-I'll be back before the kids wake up.

1:02:13.750 --> 1:02:16.125

1:02:19.166 --> 1:02:21.333
Mr. Fisher!

1:02:21.416 --> 1:02:24.208
I saw that it was your address
on the post, and I was like,

1:02:24.291 --> 1:02:25.958
"We have to party with Mr. F."

1:02:26.708 --> 1:02:29.875
I'm pouring you a shot, right now.
You're doing a shot with me, Mr. F.

1:02:29.958 --> 1:02:31.541
No, please, Skyler, you don't have to.

1:02:31.625 --> 1:02:33.666
Dude, are you okay?

1:02:33.750 --> 1:02:35.041
-No.
-What's the matter?

1:02:35.125 --> 1:02:37.250
It starts with all these people
being in my house.

1:02:37.333 --> 1:02:39.333
-It's way more than I expected.
-More than I thought.

1:02:39.416 --> 1:02:41.083
On top of that,
I've been drinking all day,

1:02:41.166 --> 1:02:43.458
my head's spinning,
I smell like tortoise shit.

1:02:43.541 --> 1:02:45.791
Not to mention, I don't even know
if the tortoise survived.

1:02:45.875 --> 1:02:48.541
-If it's not alive, that's a big problem--
-This ends now, okay?

1:02:49.250 --> 1:02:51.916
-Animal Hospital.

1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:56.750
Hey, uh, I saw two, uh, jerk-os
dropping off a… a turtle.

1:02:56.833 --> 1:02:58.375
Uh, is it okay? Is it on the mend?

1:02:58.458 --> 1:03:01.125
The one you dropped
at our door like a gunshot victim?

1:03:01.208 --> 1:03:02.708
I knew they were gonna know it was us!

1:03:02.791 --> 1:03:04.583
You shitheads
messed him up real bad.

1:03:04.666 --> 1:03:07.458
-Oh, come on. Don't say that.
-But he's gonna pull through.

1:03:07.541 --> 1:03:08.916
-What?
-What did you say?

1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.166
-He's going to pull through.
-Yes! Yes!

1:03:11.250 --> 1:03:12.208
Yes!

1:03:12.291 --> 1:03:14.583
What's your name?
We're gonna have to bill you.

1:03:14.666 --> 1:03:17.375
Oh, um, this is… this is
Armando the Tooth Fairy, stupido.

1:03:17.458 --> 1:03:20.083
-Who?
-Put it on my account! Oh my God.

1:03:20.166 --> 1:03:21.708
-The night begins anew.
-Yeah.

1:03:21.791 --> 1:03:22.833
-Oh, wait.

1:03:22.916 --> 1:03:24.458
This is the text I've been waiting for.

1:03:24.541 --> 1:03:25.541
What text?

1:03:25.625 --> 1:03:26.500
It's a surprise.

1:03:26.583 --> 1:03:29.333
Go get organized and get cleaned up.
You smell like shit.

1:03:29.416 --> 1:03:30.666
-I know, it's me. Okay.
-Come on!

1:03:30.750 --> 1:03:32.375
I'm getting everybody out in the backyard.

1:03:32.458 --> 1:03:33.291
-Hurry up!
-I smell.

1:03:33.375 --> 1:03:35.541
-All right, folks.

1:03:35.625 --> 1:03:37.833
We all know this has been
a birthday for the record books…

1:03:37.916 --> 1:03:39.083
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

1:03:39.166 --> 1:03:40.791
…made all the more special

1:03:40.875 --> 1:03:42.875
by one guest in particular.

1:03:42.958 --> 1:03:45.250
-Aw, Big Dog!

1:03:45.333 --> 1:03:46.375
That's you, man.

1:03:46.458 --> 1:03:50.083
So when I heard my best friend and brother
was coming to this birthday party,

1:03:50.166 --> 1:03:51.708
I knew I had to do something special.

1:03:51.791 --> 1:03:52.916
You don't have to do nothing.

1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.291
I called in every favor, and now,

1:03:55.916 --> 1:03:57.666
gracing this deck tonight,

1:03:57.750 --> 1:04:00.000
one of the greatest musicians in history

1:04:00.083 --> 1:04:01.666
and a personal hero of Sonny's…

1:04:04.041 --> 1:04:05.208
Seal!

1:04:09.916 --> 1:04:11.666
Thanks, Huck brother.

1:04:11.750 --> 1:04:13.208
He's the greatest!

1:04:14.541 --> 1:04:17.041
Hello, Sherman Oaks.

1:04:19.916 --> 1:04:22.291
Okay, be… be… bef… before we get started,

1:04:22.375 --> 1:04:24.125
is there a doctor in the house?

1:04:24.208 --> 1:04:26.416
I… I'm a dermatology resident.

1:04:26.500 --> 1:04:30.375
Actually, I need someone
with a particular speciality.

1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:34.208
Paging… Dr. Silk.

1:04:34.708 --> 1:04:37.708
This is him.
That's his musical personality name.

1:04:37.791 --> 1:04:39.375
Come on up, man. Come on.

1:04:39.458 --> 1:04:41.791
-You want me to come on the--
-He wants to perform with you.

1:04:41.875 --> 1:04:43.333
Stop playing with me, Huck.

1:04:48.541 --> 1:04:50.750
I went in your closet, and I found this.

1:04:52.333 --> 1:04:53.583
Yeah!

1:04:54.458 --> 1:04:56.375
-Great coat. Great coat.
-Oh my God.

1:04:56.458 --> 1:04:58.916
-How you doing, Silk?
-Good, man. I'm such a big fan.

1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:01.666
-Oh, thank you. You ready for this?
-Yeah. Yeah.

1:05:02.208 --> 1:05:04.041
Let's get a little crazy.

1:05:04.541 --> 1:05:06.000
-Come on. He--

1:05:06.791 --> 1:05:08.625
He said we gonna get a little crazy, Huck.

1:05:14.083 --> 1:05:15.416

-Yeah.

1:06:27.958 --> 1:06:29.750
One, two, three.

1:06:29.833 --> 1:06:34.750
♪ Ohh, if all were there
When we first took the pill ♪

1:06:34.833 --> 1:06:41.250
♪ Then maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe ♪

1:06:41.333 --> 1:06:43.875
-Come here, Sonny! Oh, my…

1:06:43.958 --> 1:06:45.458
-You did so good!
-Thank you.

1:06:45.541 --> 1:06:47.708
Hey, man, I thought Seal
was white this whole time.

1:06:47.791 --> 1:06:49.375
-No, man!
-Until today.

1:06:49.458 --> 1:06:50.333
-Sonny!
-Yes, sir.

1:06:50.416 --> 1:06:52.250
-Oh my God, that was incredible!
-Thank you.

1:06:52.333 --> 1:06:55.000
I don't know what happened to you
in the desert, but you're a new man.

1:06:55.083 --> 1:06:56.125
Wow.

1:06:56.208 --> 1:06:57.125
Check this out.

1:06:58.750 --> 1:07:00.750
No more Dashiell's dad. Uh-uh.

1:07:00.833 --> 1:07:03.250
-Wow.
-We are real friends. Real friends!

1:07:03.333 --> 1:07:05.166
-That means a lot to me.
-Good.

1:07:05.250 --> 1:07:06.916
Remind me your last name again?

1:07:08.250 --> 1:07:09.625
Seven years.

1:07:09.708 --> 1:07:10.625
Washington?

1:07:10.708 --> 1:07:13.208
-No.
-Oh, no, it's Carter. It's Carter.

1:07:13.291 --> 1:07:14.916
No, it's not… it's not, actually.

1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:15.875
Johnson?

1:07:15.958 --> 1:07:18.666
Uh, I feel like
you're just saying Black last names.

1:07:18.750 --> 1:07:20.458
-I am.
-It's Fisher.

1:07:20.541 --> 1:07:22.041
-Fisher. Fisher.
-Fisher. Yeah.

1:07:22.125 --> 1:07:25.208
-Like Derek. He's Black.
-Yeah, it still means a lot. This is--

1:07:25.291 --> 1:07:27.041
-Nice. Oh, man.
-Yeah.

1:07:27.125 --> 1:07:29.916
-I'm feeling so dialed in right now.
-Okay.

1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:32.208
I'll go to your kid's room
and finish his Lego project, okay?

1:07:32.291 --> 1:07:35.125
-Oh, well, no, that's not okay, Alan.
-There he is.

1:07:35.625 --> 1:07:40.750
-Dr. Silky Silk!
-The highest level possible is attained.

1:07:40.833 --> 1:07:43.541
Hey, you? You're canceling your flight.

1:07:43.625 --> 1:07:44.500
What?

1:07:44.583 --> 1:07:45.958
-Cancel your flight.
-No, no, what?

1:07:46.041 --> 1:07:48.875
You're not going to Buenos Aires

1:07:48.958 --> 1:07:52.041
because I'm going to pay your debt
with Stan Berman.

1:07:52.125 --> 1:07:54.416
No, that is an incredible offer,
but I cannot accept.

1:07:54.500 --> 1:07:56.291
I owe the man $47,000.

1:07:56.375 --> 1:07:58.666
I know what you owe him, and I don't care.

1:07:58.750 --> 1:08:01.708
All right, look, we've always had
each other's backs, have we not?

1:08:01.791 --> 1:08:02.791
-Of course.
-Have we not?

1:08:02.875 --> 1:08:06.666
Okay, and I am a much better version
of myself when I'm with you.

1:08:06.750 --> 1:08:09.250
Now Maya and I,
we got some extra cash put away.

1:08:09.333 --> 1:08:11.000
You gotta run this by her first.

1:08:11.083 --> 1:08:14.041
Why? She didn't run
her business with Armando by me.

1:08:14.125 --> 1:08:17.041
Now, I was thinking about
getting that 2022 Honda Odyssey,

1:08:17.125 --> 1:08:19.750
but this is… this is
a much better use of my funds.

1:08:19.833 --> 1:08:21.458
-Are you for real?
-Yes.

1:08:21.541 --> 1:08:24.083
Oh my God, Sonny,
I was not looking forward to Argentina.

1:08:24.166 --> 1:08:25.916
And call Stan Berman
before I change my mind.

1:08:27.041 --> 1:08:28.375
Come here. Call him.

1:08:28.458 --> 1:08:30.791
Entering the routing number.

1:08:30.875 --> 1:08:35.875
-That's right.
-Okay, so I'm done there, and bam.

1:08:39.833 --> 1:08:41.166
-It went through.
-Okay.

1:08:41.833 --> 1:08:43.666
Sonny, you're a real mensch.

1:08:43.750 --> 1:08:45.916
And Huck, congratulations.
You're a free man.

1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:47.625
I have no words, Sonny, man. Thank you.

1:08:47.708 --> 1:08:49.000
Is that Seal?

1:08:49.083 --> 1:08:51.708
I saw him play Tel Aviv in 2017.

1:08:51.791 --> 1:08:54.041
Amazing show. I'm gonna ask for a selfie.

1:08:54.583 --> 1:08:57.541
Seal! Seal!

1:08:57.625 --> 1:08:59.166
Wow, Seal?

1:08:59.250 --> 1:09:01.541
He did me a favor. He's a sweetheart.

1:09:01.625 --> 1:09:03.250
-Excuse me, Big Dog?
-Yeah?

1:09:03.333 --> 1:09:04.541
I feel you'd wanna know

1:09:04.625 --> 1:09:07.541
there's a bunch
of naked middle-aged people

1:09:07.625 --> 1:09:08.583
in the Jacuzzi.

1:09:08.666 --> 1:09:10.458
Thank you for the heads-up. Damn it.

1:09:10.541 --> 1:09:12.750
-I don't want to body-shame but--
-Hey!

1:09:15.333 --> 1:09:19.041
Jill! Combover Stew! No! Stop it. Stop!

1:09:19.125 --> 1:09:20.458
Hey, Sonny, get wet.

1:09:20.541 --> 1:09:21.375
-What?
-Yeah.

1:09:21.458 --> 1:09:22.333
Come on, boo.

1:09:22.416 --> 1:09:24.916
No, and that's enough. Okay?

1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:25.958
-Daddy!
-Yeah?

1:09:26.041 --> 1:09:28.458
-Mom, Dad's out back.
-Oh my God. Hey!

1:09:28.541 --> 1:09:31.791
Oh, my goodness, look at you.
What are you doing here?

1:09:31.875 --> 1:09:33.291
I just talked to you in San Juan.

1:09:33.375 --> 1:09:36.750
Armando gave us a lift
on his G5. It was sick.

1:09:36.833 --> 1:09:38.958
Daddy, why did you kill Ole Snappy?

1:09:39.041 --> 1:09:42.083
Wh… what? Who… who's… who's that?
What are you talking about?

1:09:42.166 --> 1:09:43.375
Armando's tortoise.

1:09:43.458 --> 1:09:46.791
He sent a video to Mommy
of you and Uncle Huck running it over.

1:09:46.875 --> 1:09:49.833
-It was unmistakably you.
-Okay, Snappy? Snappy, he's alive.

1:09:49.916 --> 1:09:51.500
-Really?
-Yeah, he… he's fine.

1:09:51.583 --> 1:09:54.416
So it's a misunderstanding. I just gotta--
I'm gonna talk to your mom.

1:09:54.500 --> 1:09:57.291
I'm gonna explain it-- Wow.
There she is. Uh-oh. Oh, my.

1:09:57.375 --> 1:09:58.708
-Cannonball!
-Okay.

1:09:59.916 --> 1:10:01.375
-Bethany, no!

1:10:01.458 --> 1:10:02.375
Oh my God.

1:10:03.041 --> 1:10:04.458
Oh, no.

1:10:05.333 --> 1:10:07.708
Oh, that was such a small target.

1:10:07.791 --> 1:10:10.708
But… I'm okay!

1:10:14.541 --> 1:10:15.458
Please go upstairs.

1:10:15.541 --> 1:10:16.708
Okay, upstairs, every--

1:10:16.791 --> 1:10:18.958
What is going on?
I've been trying to reach you.

1:10:19.041 --> 1:10:21.333
And what the hell were you doing
at Armando's house?

1:10:21.416 --> 1:10:24.500
You can't ask me all the questions
because I can ask you questions too.

1:10:24.583 --> 1:10:25.958
What was Armando doing in San Juan?

1:10:26.041 --> 1:10:28.750
-We talked. I told you on the phone.
-We did not talk. We did not talk!

1:10:28.833 --> 1:10:29.916
We did not talk!

1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:31.250
-We talked!
-I told you.

1:10:31.333 --> 1:10:33.958
I said that me and Armando
are in a chess match.

1:10:34.041 --> 1:10:37.708
So you're telling me that you let a rabbit
shit in his bed because it's part--

1:10:37.791 --> 1:10:39.833
Let me stop you right there.
That wasn't a rabbit.

1:10:39.916 --> 1:10:42.416
That was my shit. That was me
playing chess at the highest level.

1:10:42.500 --> 1:10:44.291
-You shit in the bed?

1:10:44.375 --> 1:10:45.416
And you're proud of that?

1:10:45.500 --> 1:10:48.250
-The fact that I did it on command.
-Hey, what's up, girl?

1:10:48.333 --> 1:10:50.958
-Oh, Huck.
-Oh my God. I haven't seen you forever.

1:10:51.041 --> 1:10:53.458
I love that sweater.
You know, I could not pull off that color.

1:10:53.541 --> 1:10:55.416
Thank you, Huck.
Can you just give us one minute?

1:10:55.500 --> 1:10:57.416
Oh, absolutely. Real quick, Maya?

1:10:57.500 --> 1:10:59.916
Can I just say, you are married
to one of the all-time greats.

1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:02.541
I don't know what I did
to deserve a friend like him,

1:11:02.625 --> 1:11:05.833
but he came to my rescue
in a way that I will never forget.

1:11:05.916 --> 1:11:07.583
Exactly how did he do that?

1:11:07.666 --> 1:11:09.750
-I can tell you later. Fill you in later.
-No, please.

1:11:09.833 --> 1:11:12.291
-Huck, will you fill me in?
-I'll give her the Cliff Notes.

1:11:12.375 --> 1:11:14.791
Look, I owed this loan shark
a huge amount of money.

1:11:14.875 --> 1:11:16.250
It was looking dark.

1:11:16.333 --> 1:11:19.500
Sonny stepped up and saved the day.
My brother. Thank you.

1:11:19.583 --> 1:11:21.000
-Thank you.
-No, thank you.

1:11:21.083 --> 1:11:23.041
I'll let you two catch up. Give me a kiss.

1:11:23.125 --> 1:11:25.416
Thank you.
It's so good to see you as always.

1:11:25.500 --> 1:11:26.541
My guy.

1:11:26.625 --> 1:11:27.458
You're a hero.

1:11:27.541 --> 1:11:29.833
No. Nobody can read the room
like you, Huck.

1:11:30.416 --> 1:11:31.833
-Um…
-Before you say anything,

1:11:31.916 --> 1:11:33.083
let me say something to you.

1:11:33.166 --> 1:11:34.125
Okay.

1:11:34.208 --> 1:11:37.875
You need to understand the trouble
Huck was in. Huck was about to flee.

1:11:37.958 --> 1:11:40.416
Sonny, how much money
did you pay the loan shark?

1:11:40.500 --> 1:11:43.125
You want a number? I don't have
a problem giving you a number.

1:11:43.208 --> 1:11:44.458
-Okay, give it to me.
-All right.

1:11:44.541 --> 1:11:46.750
-How much?
-All right. I think it was like 47?

1:11:48.458 --> 1:11:52.083
Really, Sonny? You gave him $4,700?
Why did you do that?

1:11:52.166 --> 1:11:53.708
It wasn't 4,700.

1:11:53.791 --> 1:11:56.208
-Forty-seven… forty-seven…
-Forty-seven…

1:11:56.291 --> 1:11:57.125
Forty-seven what?

1:11:57.208 --> 1:11:58.958
Forty-seven thousand dollars.

1:11:59.750 --> 1:12:01.125
Did you say $47,000?

1:12:02.416 --> 1:12:04.333
Yeah, that's what I said.
That's what I gave him.

1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:08.583
Oh my God. Hold on. Hold on.

1:12:08.666 --> 1:12:10.291
-Dad!
-Dash! Wait!

1:12:11.083 --> 1:12:13.333
-My Death Star!
-Dash! You okay, buddy?

1:12:13.416 --> 1:12:14.375
It's ruined!

1:12:14.875 --> 1:12:17.000
Four months of painstaking Lego work,

1:12:17.500 --> 1:12:18.333
gone!

1:12:18.416 --> 1:12:21.833
Dash, baby, go get your sister.
Okay? 'Cause we're leaving.

1:12:21.916 --> 1:12:25.250
Yeah, just leave it… leave it there.
I'll snap it back. Watch out, buddy.

1:12:25.333 --> 1:12:27.291
Listen, I'm looking at the pieces
that are broken--

1:12:27.375 --> 1:12:29.333
All right, go ahead. Okay.

1:12:30.041 --> 1:12:33.083
What? Maya. Maya, where you going?

1:12:33.166 --> 1:12:35.291
Hey, come on, Maya. Maya--

1:12:35.375 --> 1:12:36.958
-Hey, Dash, listen to me.
-What?

1:12:37.041 --> 1:12:38.916
I'm gonna build that Death Star
better than ever.

1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:42.583
You better not break
Hokey Pokey's shell too. You better not!

1:12:42.666 --> 1:12:44.708
It was an accident.
I didn't do it on purpose.

1:12:44.791 --> 1:12:45.625
Wh-- Maya!

1:12:46.166 --> 1:12:47.583
Maya, come on!

1:12:48.125 --> 1:12:49.208
Okay, Maya!

1:12:54.458 --> 1:12:56.000
They didn't wanna hang around?

1:12:58.041 --> 1:13:00.458
I feel sick, man.
I need some water or something.

1:13:00.541 --> 1:13:03.208
Whoa, hang with me for a beat.
You just need some fresh air.

1:13:03.875 --> 1:13:05.791
Wait a minute. What is this?

1:13:06.458 --> 1:13:10.458
Hey! Hey, slow down!
There's kids that live in this area!

1:13:10.541 --> 1:13:11.375
Hey!

1:13:12.500 --> 1:13:13.833
Oh my God!

1:13:15.666 --> 1:13:18.250
Whoa! Hey! Hey!

1:13:19.250 --> 1:13:20.208
Hey!

1:13:20.291 --> 1:13:22.708
Oh God! What?

1:13:24.083 --> 1:13:25.708
Hey, you son of a bitch!

1:13:25.791 --> 1:13:27.708
Hey, man! Stop!

1:13:27.791 --> 1:13:28.666
Stop!

1:13:29.333 --> 1:13:31.250
What did I do to you? Hey!

1:13:32.166 --> 1:13:33.000
God!

1:13:33.625 --> 1:13:35.458
Why'd he do that to the Golden Chariot?

1:13:35.541 --> 1:13:38.083
I ain't never did nothing to nobody.
Huck, did you see that?

1:13:38.875 --> 1:13:42.708
Sonny, baby, looks like it's time
for that 2022 Honda Odyssey.

1:13:42.791 --> 1:13:43.708
What?

1:13:43.791 --> 1:13:44.750
Hit-and-run, baby.

1:13:45.333 --> 1:13:47.250
Your insurance will cover a replacement.

1:13:47.333 --> 1:13:49.916
That's my boy, Wade.
He's big into monster trucks.

1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:50.916
He did me a solid.

1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:54.500
You, my friend, you're gonna be driving
that sweet new ride by week's end.

1:13:55.500 --> 1:13:57.625
Let me… let me just…
let me sit with it for a second.

1:13:57.708 --> 1:13:59.250
You gotta have that Odyssey, baby.

1:13:59.333 --> 1:14:01.916
I know what I-- Let me process it, Huck.

1:14:02.541 --> 1:14:04.791
Just let me… let me process everything.

1:14:04.875 --> 1:14:06.958
Let me just… let me just stay with it.

1:14:07.041 --> 1:14:09.458
I know you're upset about Maya,
but when she sees the Odyssey,

1:14:09.541 --> 1:14:10.708
she's gonna fall back in love.

1:14:10.791 --> 1:14:11.958
Just give me a second, please.

1:14:12.041 --> 1:14:14.458
-All right, but I just wanna--
-That was a blast, boys.

1:14:14.541 --> 1:14:15.916
Sonny, Huck gave me your album.

1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:18.833
If I can find a CD player,
I'll give it a spin.

1:14:18.916 --> 1:14:21.875
-Wow. Uh, thank you so much, man.
-You're welcome.

1:14:21.958 --> 1:14:24.791
Anyway, my Lyft's about two minutes away,
so if we can settle up?

1:14:24.875 --> 1:14:26.500
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:14:26.583 --> 1:14:27.416
Absolutely.

1:14:27.500 --> 1:14:29.166
Hey, great set, bud.

1:14:29.250 --> 1:14:31.416
You're welcome. Okay. Adios.

1:14:31.500 --> 1:14:32.541
All right. Adios, Seal.

1:14:32.625 --> 1:14:34.500
Will you pass that on to the label, huh?

1:14:34.583 --> 1:14:36.333
Sorry about your little pinky.

1:14:36.416 --> 1:14:38.875
Okay. You don't have to talk
so close to my face.

1:14:39.375 --> 1:14:42.208
Seal. He's taking a Lyft.
I love that. He's so humble.

1:14:42.291 --> 1:14:44.208
Why did you just give him a check, Huck?

1:14:44.291 --> 1:14:46.708
-Huh?
-What "huh"? You said he did you a favor.

1:14:46.791 --> 1:14:50.625
-Well, he did. He did us a favor.
-Then why'd you give him a check?

1:14:50.708 --> 1:14:54.500
Dude, the guy usually gets a hundred grand
to do 20 minutes at a corporate event.

1:14:54.583 --> 1:14:56.833
I got him to do
his whole set for twelve-five.

1:14:56.916 --> 1:15:00.208
-It's half the money I paid for my effigy.
-It's not a favor, Huck.

1:15:00.291 --> 1:15:01.833
God, man.

1:15:01.916 --> 1:15:02.875
You never change.

1:15:02.958 --> 1:15:03.875
You're a mess.

1:15:03.958 --> 1:15:05.458
-Wow.
-Yes.

1:15:05.541 --> 1:15:07.833
-Tell me how you really feel.
-That's how I feel, Huck.

1:15:07.916 --> 1:15:10.833
I'm not gonna lose a friend over money.
I'll pay Stan Berman back myself.

1:15:11.416 --> 1:15:12.375
I'm done with you, man.

1:15:12.458 --> 1:15:14.083
Why-- We're just getting started, Sonny.

1:15:14.166 --> 1:15:16.333
Everything's going so well.
What's the problem?

1:15:16.416 --> 1:15:19.125
Here's another thing, Huck.
You're no George Clooney.

1:15:19.208 --> 1:15:21.875
You're not even close to George Clooney.

1:15:21.958 --> 1:15:23.791
That man built
a billion-dollar tequila business

1:15:23.875 --> 1:15:24.750
as a side hustle.

1:15:24.833 --> 1:15:27.833
You know what you're doing?
You're ordering tracksuits off Etsy.

1:15:27.916 --> 1:15:29.708
Yeah, people love my tracksuits.

1:15:30.458 --> 1:15:31.541
You're sad, man.

1:15:33.375 --> 1:15:35.916
And I'll tell you--
Are you kidding me, Seal? Put it--

1:15:38.083 --> 1:15:41.333
Everybody?
May I have your attention, please?

1:15:41.416 --> 1:15:43.750
-'Sup, Big Dog?
-Time for everybody to get out.

1:15:46.375 --> 1:15:48.250
Get out!

1:15:48.333 --> 1:15:51.416
-I don't wanna go back to Legoland!
-You're gonna take that drive, now!

1:15:51.500 --> 1:15:52.375
Shit!

1:15:52.458 --> 1:15:54.875
You guys in the pool, get out!

1:15:54.958 --> 1:15:58.375
-Ten more minutes.
-No, get out! All of you.

1:15:58.458 --> 1:15:59.750
Let's go. Now.

1:16:00.291 --> 1:16:03.875
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm sorry. Please. Please.

1:16:03.958 --> 1:16:04.833
Thank you.

1:16:10.166 --> 1:16:13.000
Finally. Goddamn. By myself.

1:16:20.250 --> 1:16:22.875
-Mm, mm.

1:16:24.541 --> 1:16:25.708
Shit.

1:16:25.791 --> 1:16:28.958
It was such a fun party.
Uh, it was so great to see you.

1:16:29.041 --> 1:16:30.041
Don't come over here.

1:16:30.541 --> 1:16:32.916
Mr.-- My Uber's… my Uber's here.

1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:35.208
-Sorry, I just have to--
-Okay, go ahead at your own risk.

1:16:35.291 --> 1:16:37.458
Okay, have a good… have a good night.

1:16:51.458 --> 1:16:55.750
Maya, listen,
I will get the money back. I promise.

1:16:55.833 --> 1:16:57.916
Sonny… …it's the money,

1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:00.416
it's… it's breaking into Armando's house.

1:17:00.500 --> 1:17:03.458
I mean, I just…
I feel like I don't know you.

1:17:03.541 --> 1:17:06.083
First of all, that's not even me.
You know that.

1:17:06.166 --> 1:17:08.083
That's Huck and his influence.

1:17:08.166 --> 1:17:11.541
All right? He's got me doing a bunch
of stupid shit that I'm not doing anymore.

1:17:11.625 --> 1:17:14.708
I'm done with that.
I'm back to being the Sonny of old.

1:17:14.791 --> 1:17:17.500
The… the… the Sonny that's a super dad.

1:17:17.583 --> 1:17:19.333
But… but maybe that's not what you want.

1:17:19.416 --> 1:17:21.666
Why would you say that?
That's exactly what I want.

1:17:21.750 --> 1:17:23.208
Maya, can you come home?

1:17:23.708 --> 1:17:26.708
Sonny, I think
we need a little time.

1:17:27.208 --> 1:17:28.666
We're gonna come home.

1:17:29.333 --> 1:17:31.458
You should find someplace else to stay.

1:17:31.541 --> 1:17:32.833
I have an idea.

1:17:32.916 --> 1:17:33.791
What the…

1:17:33.875 --> 1:17:35.166
You can stay with us.

1:17:35.250 --> 1:17:36.458
Are you kidding me?

1:17:36.541 --> 1:17:38.291
Alan, did you sleep in my laundry room?

1:17:38.375 --> 1:17:40.958
Yeah. On second thought,
Rita's gonna have my ass

1:17:41.041 --> 1:17:43.375
if she wakes up
at Legoland and I'm not there.

1:17:43.875 --> 1:17:45.541
She'll take away my PS5.

1:17:46.083 --> 1:17:47.125
Get out of my house.

1:17:47.208 --> 1:17:49.208
Okay. I love you, Son.

1:17:58.458 --> 1:17:59.875
Hey, buddy.

1:17:59.958 --> 1:18:02.375
I really appreciate you
letting me stay here, man.

1:18:02.458 --> 1:18:05.041
You know, me and Maya, we talked, right?

1:18:05.125 --> 1:18:10.708
And we just feel like a little space
is probably best for us right now.

1:18:10.791 --> 1:18:12.791

1:24:29.041 --> 1:24:29.875
You're right.

1:24:30.916 --> 1:24:33.916
I made this all about me,
and I… and I shouldn't have done that.

1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:38.208
I… I just wanted to… I wanted
to put on the best talent show.

1:24:38.291 --> 1:24:40.625
Same way I wanted
to chair every committee,

1:24:41.333 --> 1:24:42.791
chaperone every field trip.

1:24:42.875 --> 1:24:43.708
I just wanted…

1:24:44.291 --> 1:24:46.166
I wanted you guys to think
that I had value.

1:24:47.458 --> 1:24:51.708
In me doing that, I think I pushed away
the most important people in my life.

1:24:51.791 --> 1:24:55.333
The ones that I love,
you, your mother, I--

1:24:56.250 --> 1:24:57.083
My best friend.

1:24:58.375 --> 1:25:01.000
I mean, guys, I did a lot of stuff
that I'm not proud of.

1:25:01.083 --> 1:25:03.625
I took a shit in my wife's client bed!

1:25:03.708 --> 1:25:06.625
Yeah, put a nice steamy nugget
on his pillow.

1:25:06.708 --> 1:25:08.750
-Why? I don't know.

1:25:08.833 --> 1:25:11.708
Stole all the man's left shoes.
He can't replace those.

1:25:12.208 --> 1:25:15.291
-Put a spatula in my ass and put it back.

1:25:15.375 --> 1:25:17.625
I hope he didn't use it again,
but if he did,

1:25:18.750 --> 1:25:19.583
he ate ass!

1:25:19.666 --> 1:25:21.083
-And guess what?

1:25:21.166 --> 1:25:23.250
This type of stuff ends today.

1:25:23.333 --> 1:25:24.791
It ends now. So, Alan!

1:25:24.875 --> 1:25:27.000
-Yeah?
-Buddy, it starts with you.

1:25:27.541 --> 1:25:29.500
In addition to filling in
for Crossing Guard Lenore

1:25:29.583 --> 1:25:31.875
while she goes on vacation
with her husband,

1:25:31.958 --> 1:25:35.291
uh, which is news to me,
because you told me that she was divorced.

1:25:35.375 --> 1:25:38.791
Well, I heard-- You're a… you're a liar.

1:25:38.875 --> 1:25:41.500
My son, Justin, he's the one
that said they got a divorce.

1:25:41.583 --> 1:25:43.416
-Yeah. Blame our child.
-That's not me.

1:25:43.500 --> 1:25:46.458
What I want you to do, Alan,
I want you to take over Café Fridays.

1:25:46.541 --> 1:25:47.750
-I gotta--
-He'll do it.

1:25:47.833 --> 1:25:48.875
-Babe!
-He's available.

1:25:48.958 --> 1:25:51.416
And to the kids out there
that didn't make the cut,

1:25:51.500 --> 1:25:53.833
you come on up here
and put your talent on display too,

1:25:53.916 --> 1:25:57.250
because that's what it's about.
It's about you having fun, and I'm sorry.

1:25:57.833 --> 1:26:00.291
I'm sorry that I tried
to take that away. And son,

1:26:00.791 --> 1:26:03.250
I owe you a huge apology.

1:26:03.916 --> 1:26:04.875
Huge.

1:26:05.416 --> 1:26:08.666
-I'm sorry, and I love you. Okay?
-I love you too.

1:26:08.750 --> 1:26:12.166
All right. Hey, man, now listen.
I want you to do whatever you want to do.

1:26:12.250 --> 1:26:14.625
If you wanna sing, you wanna dance,

1:26:14.708 --> 1:26:16.458
whatever it is, have fun.

1:26:17.166 --> 1:26:18.708
I'm out of your way, guys.

1:26:18.791 --> 1:26:20.708
I'm out of your hair. Go get 'em, son!

1:26:25.958 --> 1:26:27.291
Sonny Fisher, everyone!

1:26:31.291 --> 1:26:33.208
The best dad in the world.

1:26:33.291 --> 1:26:34.416
Ah, thank you.

1:26:34.500 --> 1:26:36.958
This guy has had a tough few weeks.

1:26:37.041 --> 1:26:39.625
The man spent spring break by himself,

1:26:39.708 --> 1:26:42.333
ended up blowing our life savings,

1:26:42.416 --> 1:26:43.791
almost killing a tortoise,

1:26:43.875 --> 1:26:45.666
and destroying his marriage.

1:26:45.750 --> 1:26:47.791
-Well, yeah. I mean--

1:26:47.875 --> 1:26:50.250
Way to make the most
of your "me time," Pops.

1:26:53.166 --> 1:26:54.750
I see you laughing, Alan Geller.

1:26:54.833 --> 1:26:56.333
Uh, did your wife give you permission?

1:26:56.416 --> 1:26:59.500
-Oh!

1:26:59.583 --> 1:27:01.333
Y'all wanna hear some more jokes?

1:27:07.958 --> 1:27:08.916
Scoot over?

1:27:09.458 --> 1:27:10.500
Um…

1:27:11.208 --> 1:27:12.125
Yeah.

1:27:16.500 --> 1:27:17.541
Nice speech.

1:27:18.083 --> 1:27:20.208
Thank you.

1:27:21.541 --> 1:27:23.041
Look, Maya, I'm, uh…

1:27:24.208 --> 1:27:27.875
I'm really sorry that I lent Huck
that money without talking to you first.

1:27:28.875 --> 1:27:31.458
Sonny, what hurt me so much is that…

1:27:32.791 --> 1:27:37.833
I don't know, we… we… we always talk about
those kinds of things together.

1:27:39.250 --> 1:27:40.291
Yeah.

1:27:40.875 --> 1:27:43.000
I really think
that you should call Armando back

1:27:43.083 --> 1:27:44.791
and consider taking that job,

1:27:45.375 --> 1:27:46.750
starting your own firm.

1:27:47.833 --> 1:27:48.958
You know, Sonny…

1:27:51.708 --> 1:27:54.875
…the way you take care
of our family, it is… it's…

1:27:56.625 --> 1:27:57.708
it's hard.

1:27:57.791 --> 1:28:00.000
You know, Dash is right, you are…

1:28:01.166 --> 1:28:02.416
well, you're the glue.

1:28:03.500 --> 1:28:06.458
I can't even imagine
starting my own firm without you

1:28:07.666 --> 1:28:08.625
in my corner.

1:28:09.416 --> 1:28:11.583
Look, Maya, I promise you that, uh,

1:28:13.166 --> 1:28:14.000
I got your back.

1:28:14.500 --> 1:28:15.875
I love you, Sonny.

1:28:15.958 --> 1:28:16.958
Love you too.

1:28:27.750 --> 1:28:29.375
I can't believe I cut this kid.

1:28:29.875 --> 1:28:31.125
You cut this kid?

1:28:31.208 --> 1:28:33.083
I'm such a dick.

1:28:37.083 --> 1:28:40.000
Stan Berman? What is this?

1:28:40.083 --> 1:28:43.833
Hey, Huck, I just got this alert
that Stan Berman returned my money.

1:28:43.916 --> 1:28:46.666
Is everything okay?
Anyway, I really need to talk to you.

1:28:46.750 --> 1:28:49.541
Something just went down
in Dash's talent show,

1:28:49.625 --> 1:28:52.250
and it got me to thinking, man,
just about some things that I did

1:28:52.333 --> 1:28:54.500
and… and what I said to you
and that I was wrong.

1:28:54.583 --> 1:28:55.958
I wanna apologize.

1:28:56.041 --> 1:28:57.666
But not like this. Face-to-face.

1:28:58.583 --> 1:28:59.833
Where you at, Huck?

1:29:00.500 --> 1:29:01.333
The marina?

1:29:02.875 --> 1:29:05.375
Oh my God,
Stan's about to go butcher on his ass.

1:29:05.875 --> 1:29:07.541
I'm coming, Huck. I'm coming.

1:29:17.916 --> 1:29:19.833
Oh God, Huck's in trouble.

1:29:19.916 --> 1:29:22.083
I needed backup.
I didn't know who else to call.

1:29:22.708 --> 1:29:25.041
I got you, Big Dog.
Let's go whoop some ass.

1:29:25.125 --> 1:29:28.083
-No, we're not whooping no ass. Come on!
-Then why did I bring this?

1:29:28.166 --> 1:29:32.041
I got some… some nunchucks
and a taser and some pepper spray.

1:29:32.125 --> 1:29:35.833
What are you doing?
No, we don't need that. What is that?

1:29:35.916 --> 1:29:36.791
Throwing stars.

1:29:37.500 --> 1:29:39.708
-Just--
-Just give me two of them.

1:29:39.791 --> 1:29:42.958
Eddie, get the lobsters first
before you get the guns.

1:29:43.041 --> 1:29:46.416
It's gonna melt. Come on, chop-chop.
We gotta go guys, all right?

1:30:05.750 --> 1:30:07.458
-That's Dorito.
-That's the bitch?

1:30:07.541 --> 1:30:09.000
-Yeah.
-Do you want me to fight her?

1:30:09.083 --> 1:30:10.500
No, she got a flamethrower.

1:30:10.583 --> 1:30:12.166
-Oh shit!
-Come on.

1:30:12.250 --> 1:30:13.083
Duck down.

1:30:14.625 --> 1:30:16.375
-Is that blood?

1:30:16.458 --> 1:30:18.083
Oh my God, that sounds like a bone saw.

1:30:18.166 --> 1:30:19.208
-Oh my God!
-Huck!

1:30:19.291 --> 1:30:22.666
-I'm coming to save you, Huck!
-I got two throwing stars and Thelma!

1:30:22.750 --> 1:30:25.083
-Oh, thank God.

1:30:25.166 --> 1:30:26.541
What are you guys doing?

1:30:26.625 --> 1:30:29.291
-What do you mean? Thelma, go stand guard.
-Okay.

1:30:29.375 --> 1:30:31.291
-Hey, baby girl.
-I'm so glad you're alive.

1:30:31.375 --> 1:30:33.416
-It's great to see you. What's going on?
-Oh, you too.

1:30:33.500 --> 1:30:35.791
Dude, I thought
you was getting murdered, man.

1:30:35.875 --> 1:30:37.583
I just saw somebody covered in blood.

1:30:37.666 --> 1:30:40.041
No, we had
a strawberry daiquiri incident, stupid.

1:30:40.125 --> 1:30:41.625
Why are you making daiquiris, Huck?

1:30:41.708 --> 1:30:44.000
'Cause, it's my job.
What do you think I'm doing?

1:30:44.083 --> 1:30:47.625
You know, I made a deal with Stan Berman
to pay you your $47,000 back,

1:30:47.708 --> 1:30:49.125
and now I'm working off my debt.

1:30:49.208 --> 1:30:52.041
His business is taking him to Yemen,
so that's where I'm gonna move.

1:30:52.125 --> 1:30:53.166
Yemen?

1:30:53.250 --> 1:30:54.416
Yeah, Yemen.

1:30:54.500 --> 1:30:56.583
Huck, your life is here.

1:30:56.666 --> 1:30:57.500
-Really?
-Yes.

1:30:57.583 --> 1:30:59.833
Well, I have no career, no family,

1:30:59.916 --> 1:31:03.291
and you were right, Sonny,
I'm no Clooney, and I'm okay with it.

1:31:03.375 --> 1:31:05.458
Stop comparing yourself to Clooney.

1:31:05.541 --> 1:31:08.041
Wanna know what I learned today
at Dash's talent show?

1:31:08.125 --> 1:31:11.625
I learned that I have to embrace myself
and the people I love for who they are.

1:31:11.708 --> 1:31:14.333
Bringing people closer together,
Huck, that's your gift.

1:31:14.416 --> 1:31:16.083
-That's what you do.
-Don't do this to me.

1:31:16.166 --> 1:31:18.333
-I'm not doing--
-Don't do this to me right now, okay?

1:31:18.416 --> 1:31:21.500
This is my way out.
I got us into this. I'm gonna get us out.

1:31:21.583 --> 1:31:24.583
Okay? Get off the bow,
and let me go batten down the hatches

1:31:24.666 --> 1:31:25.791
and all that other boat talk.

1:31:25.875 --> 1:31:26.875
What?

1:31:27.583 --> 1:31:29.166
Huck, can you hear me out, please?

1:31:29.250 --> 1:31:30.416
I'm busy.

1:31:30.500 --> 1:31:33.250
You're opening and closing
the door, not battening anything.

1:31:33.333 --> 1:31:36.041
Huck, listen, there…
there's another way out.

1:31:36.125 --> 1:31:38.958
And you're great at throwing parties.
That's what you do well.

1:31:39.041 --> 1:31:41.583
And you know what I'm great at?
Entertaining kids.

1:31:41.666 --> 1:31:45.125
So here's my plan.
I go, I give Stan back the money.

1:31:45.208 --> 1:31:49.083
Right? And you and I, we start a business
where we throw kids' parties.

1:31:49.166 --> 1:31:53.000
We'll make the money back in no time.
I'll get you off the goddamn boat.

1:31:53.083 --> 1:31:55.083
We'll put that stuff behind us.
How does that sound?

1:31:57.375 --> 1:32:00.291
I love you, buddy.
I don't want to go to Yemen.

1:32:00.375 --> 1:32:02.041
-I know you--
-Let's go, idiots!

1:32:02.125 --> 1:32:07.166
Yo, I just took the biggest shit
in the loan shark's bed.

1:32:07.250 --> 1:32:08.375
Why would you do that?

1:32:08.458 --> 1:32:11.083
I thought we were doing
the little annoying things like before,

1:32:11.166 --> 1:32:12.708
you know, like it's our thing?

1:32:16.583 --> 1:32:18.791
You know how long it took me
to set this table?

1:32:19.625 --> 1:32:21.416
How long's it gonna take to mess it up?

1:32:21.500 --> 1:32:22.458
Huh?

1:32:22.541 --> 1:32:24.083
This lobster needs to be free.

1:32:24.166 --> 1:32:25.458
Yeah!

1:32:25.541 --> 1:32:26.958
He likes it spicy.

1:32:27.041 --> 1:32:28.208
Look at this, guys.

1:32:29.708 --> 1:32:30.625
Put the claw--

1:32:30.708 --> 1:32:33.791
Let the claw get in my ass
so he can eat some claw ass.

1:32:33.875 --> 1:32:36.250
Oh my God.

1:32:36.333 --> 1:32:38.625
Here, man, have a little dick pepper?
Watch out!

1:32:38.708 --> 1:32:42.291
I got it. Let's see what you do
when you got a little dick pepper.

1:32:42.375 --> 1:32:45.041
-No, what are you doing? Stop. No.
-I'm grinding pepper on your dick.

1:32:45.125 --> 1:32:47.291
-Why would you do that?
-You said you wanted dick pepper.

1:32:47.375 --> 1:32:49.041
Then you gave me the prank, stupid.

1:32:49.125 --> 1:32:51.166
I'm starting to itch bad.
This stuff is hot.

1:32:51.250 --> 1:32:52.291
Let's get out of here.

1:32:52.375 --> 1:32:53.208
Come on.

1:32:53.291 --> 1:32:55.208
I love you, man. I love you guys.

1:32:55.291 --> 1:32:58.166
Okay, so this is mine. We gotta go
'cause I got pepper on my dick.

1:32:58.250 --> 1:32:59.458
-We gotta go.
-Sorry about that.

1:32:59.541 --> 1:33:01.333
-Come on! Come on!
-Yeah!

1:33:01.416 --> 1:33:04.583
♪ 'Cause I, I, I'm in the stars tonight ♪

1:33:05.083 --> 1:33:08.916
♪ So watch me bring the fire
And set the night alight ♪

1:33:10.083 --> 1:33:13.708
♪ Shinin' through the city

1:33:13.791 --> 1:33:17.333
♪ So I'mma light it up like dynamite… ♪

1:33:17.416 --> 1:33:21.416
All right, guys. Uh, let's go zebra,
tiger, zebra, tiger with the lunchboxes.

1:33:21.500 --> 1:33:22.916
Just makes it a better flow.

1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:25.916
Whoa, Stew! Oh my God,
I love the new look, man.

1:33:26.000 --> 1:33:28.416
Oh, thanks. Can't call me
Combover Stew anymore.

1:33:29.416 --> 1:33:32.291
-Best part is Jeremiah's super into it.
-What?

1:33:32.375 --> 1:33:34.916
Yeah, he calls me his little Howie Mandel.

1:33:36.250 --> 1:33:37.125
-So--
-Okay.

1:33:37.208 --> 1:33:40.875
Sonny! Hey, that vintage porn
inspired these pants, brother.

1:33:40.958 --> 1:33:41.791
I can tell.

1:33:41.875 --> 1:33:43.375
Hey, hey, got some iced tea for you.

1:33:43.458 --> 1:33:45.708
-Don't even ask, Mom.
-Right on time. Thank you.

1:33:45.791 --> 1:33:46.958
Thank you.

1:33:47.041 --> 1:33:48.333
Maya, Sonny,

1:33:48.416 --> 1:33:51.625
your relationship has been my inspiration.

1:33:51.708 --> 1:33:52.666
Oh my God.

1:33:52.750 --> 1:33:59.500
Yeah. So I thought you two should be
the first to see my new erotic novel.

1:33:59.583 --> 1:34:02.000
-Oh, you see, um--
-Wow. Behind the Queen.

1:34:02.083 --> 1:34:03.000
-Yes.
-Yeah.

1:34:03.583 --> 1:34:04.833
Have you read the book, Pops?

1:34:04.916 --> 1:34:07.500
-Read it? I lived it.

1:34:07.583 --> 1:34:10.125
-That's enough. Can I talk to you?
-I'm gonna go get a drink.

1:34:10.208 --> 1:34:12.541
-You want me to sign it for you?
-No, no, I don't.

1:34:12.625 --> 1:34:15.000
Tortoises are the best pets you can have.

1:34:15.083 --> 1:34:16.208
Okay? Any questions?

1:34:16.291 --> 1:34:18.750
Hey, bestie! What's up? Having fun?

1:34:18.833 --> 1:34:21.416
Sonny, my man. Welcome.
My house is your house, okay?

1:34:21.500 --> 1:34:24.125
And hey,
the bathroom is over there.

1:34:24.208 --> 1:34:25.791
I know why you're saying that.

1:34:25.875 --> 1:34:26.708
Well-deserved.

1:34:26.791 --> 1:34:29.125
Alan, hey!

1:34:29.208 --> 1:34:31.958
-Hey.
-It's Skyler, from the club.

1:34:32.041 --> 1:34:33.916
-Hey!
-I haven't seen you in so long.

1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:36.666
-Oh my God!
-Sorry, how do you two know each other?

1:34:36.750 --> 1:34:39.333
-The club.
-The club, from the coffee club.

1:34:39.416 --> 1:34:40.500
She's a barista.

1:34:40.583 --> 1:34:41.541
At a coffee club?

1:34:41.625 --> 1:34:42.750
She sure is.

1:34:42.833 --> 1:34:46.083
-You should come by, soon.
-I will come by. I need coffee.

1:34:46.166 --> 1:34:48.750
-It's the best coffee.
-It is pretty goddamn good.

1:34:48.833 --> 1:34:52.000
-What do you get at the coffee club?
-A drip. I get a drip.

1:34:52.083 --> 1:34:54.791
Dudes, I just felt a serious connection
with your friend Jill.

1:34:55.500 --> 1:34:58.625
-Well, that's nice, Huck. I like it.
-Well, well. Hey, Jill.

1:34:59.125 --> 1:35:01.166
-Hey, Jill!
-How's the ex-husband?

1:35:01.250 --> 1:35:02.958
He living. I don't know.

1:35:03.041 --> 1:35:04.791
And the two boys under ten,
how they doing?

1:35:04.875 --> 1:35:08.666
-Raising themselves at this point.
-Good. Glad the whole team is fine.

1:35:08.750 --> 1:35:11.250
-We are fine.
-What do you mean, two boys under ten?

1:35:11.333 --> 1:35:13.916
-She got a whole situation.
-What? Stepdad Huck.

1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:15.625
-No.
-That's such a Clooney move.

1:35:15.708 --> 1:35:17.500
-She's a sweetheart.
-Does he have step-kids?

1:35:17.583 --> 1:35:20.708
No, he doesn't.
Clooney doesn't have step-kids.

1:35:20.791 --> 1:35:21.791
I'm gonna do it.

1:35:21.875 --> 1:35:23.208
Before I'm 60…

1:35:23.291 --> 1:35:24.208
You're gonna do it?

1:35:24.291 --> 1:35:25.666
…I'm gonna have one of these.

1:35:26.208 --> 1:35:28.416
I gotta… I gotta get him away from Jill.
