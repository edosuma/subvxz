09:01.867 --> 09:04.300
AW, WAIT.
I FORGOT THE LAUNDRY.

09:04.300 --> 09:06.133
RAVEN HAS REALLY
BEEN ON MY CASE, MAN.

09:06.133 --> 09:07.300
I GOTTA
TAKE CARE OF THIS.

09:07.300 --> 09:08.200
YOU'RE GONNA WASH IT NOW?

09:08.200 --> 09:10.567
NO, I'M GONNA
HIDE IT NOW.
COME ON, MAN.

09:10.567 --> 09:13.100
[THINKING]
I KNOW THOSE CIGARETTES
ARE IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

09:13.100 --> 09:14.667
MY VISIONS ARE NEVER WRONG.

09:14.667 --> 09:17.734
EVEN I GOTTA LAUGH
AT THAT ONE.

09:17.734 --> 09:18.967
HA HA HA HA HA!

09:18.967 --> 09:21.200
COME ON, LARRY.
LET'S FIRE IT UP.

09:21.200 --> 09:21.700
FIRE IT UP?

09:21.700 --> 09:25.967
[THINKING] PERFECT. NOW
I CAN CATCH HIM IN THE ACT.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.467
[WHISTLING]

09:31.467 --> 09:33.000
[BONK]
WHAT WAS THAT?

09:33.000 --> 09:35.133
MAYBE SOMEONE
DROPPED A COCONUT.

09:35.133 --> 09:36.767
YEAH.

09:43.367 --> 09:46.000
THIS IS BEYOND NASTY.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.567
OK, LET'S START DRAGGING.

09:47.567 --> 09:48.233
YEAH.

09:48.233 --> 09:50.233
LARRY'S SMOKING, TOO?

09:50.233 --> 09:53.900
I KNEW THAT KID
WAS A BAD SEED.

09:54.700 --> 09:56.000
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

09:56.000 --> 09:58.467
[SNIFFING, THEN COUGHING]

09:58.467 --> 10:02.367
I GUESS THIS DIRTY LAUNDRY'S
GETTING A LITTLE RIPE.

10:05.300 --> 10:08.734
EEW! EEW! EEW! EEW!

10:09.367 --> 10:12.300
MORE GOOFY SOCKS.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.700
ALL DONE.
THERE WE GO.

10:16.700 --> 10:17.767
YEAH.
YOU READY?

10:17.767 --> 10:19.867
LET'S DO IT!

10:20.667 --> 10:24.400
MIGHT AS WELL
KICK OFF YOUR SHOES
AND GET COMFORTABLE.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.300
AHH, MAN.

10:26.300 --> 10:30.300
[THINKING] PUKE. THIS WASN'T
THE BEST HIDING PLACE.

10:30.300 --> 10:32.367
MAN, THESE THINGS
ARE GETTING EXPENSIVE.

10:32.367 --> 10:34.667
BUT WHAT CAN WE DO?
WE'RE HOOKED.

10:34.667 --> 10:37.500
YEAH. ALL RIGHT,
I GET THE FIRST DRAG.

10:37.500 --> 10:38.567
YOU KNOW YOU'RE
JUST GONNA CHOKE.

10:38.567 --> 10:41.200
NO, NOT THIS TIME.
I'VE BEEN SMOKIN' 'EM
AT THE ARCADE.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.300
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH THIS THING?

10:43.300 --> 10:45.767
IT'S NOT LIGHTING UP.

10:46.734 --> 10:49.600
YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS PACK
MUST NOT BE FRESH.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.800
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I ALWAYS KEEP A FRESH PACK
AT MY HOUSE.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.367
LET'S HEAD OVER
TO YOUR HOUSE.

10:54.367 --> 10:57.200
MY HOUSE JUST
AIN'T WORKING OUT.

11:00.066 --> 11:03.133
LET'S HEAD FOR YOUR HOUSE.

11:11.033 --> 11:15.967
Cory: ONE SECOND, LARRY.
I FORGOT TO DO SOMETHING.

11:27.967 --> 11:32.367
IT'S A GOOD THING
RAVEN DIDN'T FIND THESE.

11:57.934 --> 11:59.233
AHA! GOT 'EM!

11:59.233 --> 12:03.033
HE IS NOT GONNA
LIE HIS WAY OUT OF THIS ONE.

12:03.033 --> 12:05.700
[DING]
OH! IT'S READY! YES!

12:05.700 --> 12:07.400
OVER MITTS.

12:07.400 --> 12:10.867
OH, RIGHT.
THANKS, MAN.

12:10.867 --> 12:12.600
OK, CLOSE THAT.
CLOSE THAT.

12:12.600 --> 12:13.967
OH, MAN.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.667
[SNIFFING]
SMELLS GREAT.

12:15.667 --> 12:16.200
LOOKS GREAT.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.567
LET'S SEE
IF IT TASTES GREAT.

12:17.567 --> 12:18.400
NO, WE CAN'T!

12:18.400 --> 12:20.367
THAT'S HOW WE GOT INTO
THIS MESS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

12:20.367 --> 12:22.300
I KNOW. IT'S JUST THAT
IT TASTES SO GOOD.

12:22.300 --> 12:23.200
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING?

12:23.200 --> 12:25.200
NOTHING.
JUST, LIKE YOU SAID,

12:25.200 --> 12:27.567
WAITING ON THE MAYOR'S
CASSEROLE TO COOL DOWN.

12:27.567 --> 12:28.467
YEP, YEP, YEP.

12:28.467 --> 12:30.000
THAT WAS HOURS AGO.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.467
OH, MY GOODNESS.

12:31.467 --> 12:32.400
IT'S HOT.

12:32.400 --> 12:35.400
LIKE IT JUST
CAME OUT OF THE OVEN.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.500
WELL, YOU KNOW
THAT OLD SAYING:

12:38.500 --> 12:41.100
A WATCHED CASSEROLE
NEVER COOLS.

12:41.100 --> 12:43.100
YEAH, I HEARD THAT.

12:43.100 --> 12:44.100
YEAH.

12:44.100 --> 12:47.300
LOOK, WHATEVER.
I HAVE BIGGER PROBLEMS.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.367
WHAT? WELL, RAE.

12:49.367 --> 12:52.600
COME ON! WHATEVER
THE PROBLEM IS HERE,

12:52.600 --> 12:55.934
SMOKING IS NO SOLUTION.

12:55.934 --> 12:59.600
I DON'T HAVE
THE PROBLEM, CHELS.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.600
CORY IS
THE ONE SMOKING.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.033
CORY? ARE YOU SURE?

13:03.033 --> 13:06.000
WHAT? CORY'S TOO SMART
TO BE SMOKING.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
YEAH, I THOUGHT
SO, TOO,

13:07.000 --> 13:08.667
BUT I FOUND
A CIGARETTE
IN HIS POCKET,

13:08.667 --> 13:11.367
AND I FOUND THIS
PACK IN HIS ROOM.

13:11.367 --> 13:13.867
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS BAD TO ME.

13:13.867 --> 13:16.233
AND THEN I JUST
HEARD HIM AND LARRY

13:16.233 --> 13:17.500
THAT THEY WERE
GONNA TAKE A DRAG

13:17.500 --> 13:20.900
AND LIGHT IT UP
AND SMOKE IT AND...

13:20.900 --> 13:21.734
WAIT A MINUTE.
ARE YOU SURE

13:21.734 --> 13:24.200
THEY JUST WEREN'T PLAYING
<i>DRAG RACE 3000</i>

13:24.200 --> 13:27.500
AND YOU MISINTERPRETED
EVERYTHING YOU HEARD?

13:28.367 --> 13:31.734
CHELS,
COME BACK TO EARTH.

13:31.734 --> 13:33.934
OK. I'M BACK.

13:33.934 --> 13:36.800
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT CORY.

13:36.800 --> 13:37.700
ARE YOU GONNA
TELL YOUR DAD?

13:37.700 --> 13:39.500
IF I HAVE TO,
BUT I WANT TO TALK
TO HIM MYSELF FIRST.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.400
COME ON, RAE.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA
DO THAT?

13:41.400 --> 13:43.767
I HAVE AN IDEA, BUT
I'M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP.

13:43.767 --> 13:45.233
YOU KNOW WE GOT
YOUR BACK, GIRL.

13:45.233 --> 13:47.500
I KNOW. I'M JUST
GONNA MAKE A COUPLE CALLS.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.300
OK.

13:49.700 --> 13:51.400
OOH, SPEAKING
OF CALLS...

13:51.400 --> 13:53.200
SOMETHING
IS CALLING ME.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.200
EDDIE, COME ON, DUDE.
NO. LOOK, WE CAN'T.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.233
BUT WE MUST.

13:58.233 --> 14:00.467
OK. WE CAN ALWAYS
MAKE ANOTHER ONE.

14:00.467 --> 14:02.367
RIGHT.

14:08.734 --> 14:11.367
[DOORBELL RINGS]

14:13.867 --> 14:16.033
OH, CINDY. THANK
GOODNESS. COME ON IN.

14:16.033 --> 14:17.767
RAVEN, I GOT
YOUR MESSAGE.

14:17.767 --> 14:19.400
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

14:19.400 --> 14:20.500
JOIN THE GROUP.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.834
HERE'S THE SITUATION.

14:22.834 --> 14:24.800
SOMEONE THAT
WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE

14:24.800 --> 14:27.900
IS...SMOKING.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.133
IT'S CORY.

14:31.133 --> 14:31.734
CORY?

14:31.734 --> 14:34.100
YEAH, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
OF COURSE HE DENIED IT,
YOU KNOW?

14:34.100 --> 14:36.700
SAYING HE WAS
HOLDING IT FOR A FRIEND.

14:36.700 --> 14:39.600
THE MOST TRANSPARENT
OF ALL ALIBIS.

14:39.600 --> 14:43.367
SEE? I JUST CAN'T
GET THROUGH TO HIM.

14:43.367 --> 14:45.300
BUT IF ALL OF
HIS FRIENDS STEP UP

14:45.300 --> 14:46.967
AND HOW HIM HOW
CONCERNED THEY ARE,

14:46.967 --> 14:48.400
MAYBE HE'LL LISTEN
TO REASON.

14:48.400 --> 14:49.934
SEE, EVERYONE,
I THINK THAT

14:49.934 --> 14:52.834
CORY JUST NEEDS
A LITTLE BIT OF,
YOU KNOW, PATIENCE...

14:52.834 --> 14:54.900
UNDERSTANDING...

14:55.467 --> 14:57.367
GET HIM!

15:01.700 --> 15:03.734
OK, WHAT DID I DO?

15:03.734 --> 15:05.300
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU DID, CORY.

15:05.300 --> 15:07.300
THE LYING STOPS
RIGHT NOW.

15:07.300 --> 15:10.033
WHAT? LOOK, I WAS JUST
AT LARRY'S HOUSE, OK?

15:10.033 --> 15:13.100
I'LL DO THE STUPID LAUNDRY.
I'LL DO EVERYBODY'S LAUNDRY.

15:13.100 --> 15:15.300
NO, IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE LAUNDRY.

15:15.300 --> 15:16.900
WE NEED YOU
TO CALM DOWN, OK?

15:16.900 --> 15:19.000
ALL RIGHT? YOU'RE
IN A SAFE PLACE.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.200
NOW, I JUST WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU

15:22.200 --> 15:24.667
ABOUT THIS DISGUSTING
SMOKING HABIT.

15:24.667 --> 15:27.700
LISTEN, HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I TOLD YOU?

15:27.700 --> 15:29.834
I DO NOT SMOKE.

15:29.834 --> 15:31.700
I FOUND THESE
IN YOUR ROOM.

15:31.700 --> 15:32.467
YOU WENT IN MY ROOM?

15:32.467 --> 15:34.567
I THOUGHT WE HAD
RULES ABOUT THAT.

15:34.567 --> 15:35.400
THE RULES
ARE NULL AND VOID

15:35.400 --> 15:37.734
WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR
HEALTH AND SAFETY, CORY.

15:37.734 --> 15:40.400
NOW SIT DOWN.
YOUR FRIENDS HAVE
SOMETHING TO SAY.

15:40.400 --> 15:41.200
WILLIAM.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.367
I'M JUST GONNA GIVE YOU
THE FACTS, CORY.

15:43.367 --> 15:45.834
ONE: SMOKING
GIVES YOU BAD BREATH.

15:45.834 --> 15:49.233
BAD BREATH. AND WHAT GIRL
IS GONNA WANT TO BE WITH YOU

15:49.233 --> 15:52.000
IF YOU SMELL
LIKE AN ASHTRAY, CORY?

15:52.000 --> 15:53.233
LOOK AT CINDY.

15:53.233 --> 15:56.567
GAGGING ALREADY.
THINK SHE GONNA KISS
YOUR NASTY MOUTH?

15:56.567 --> 15:59.300
TWO: SMOKING IS GROSS.

15:59.300 --> 16:01.100
TURNS YOUR FINGERNAILS
YELLOW,

16:01.100 --> 16:02.834
AND YOUR TEETH BROWN.

16:02.834 --> 16:05.400
YOUR FINGERNAILS YELLOW
AND YOUR TEETH BROWN.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.300
IS THAT WHAT
YOU WANT, CORY?

16:07.300 --> 16:09.834
THREE: EVERY CIGARETTE
YOU SMOKE

16:09.834 --> 16:13.200
DESTROYS YOUR LUNGS,
WEAKENS YOUR HEART,

16:13.200 --> 16:14.467
AND SHORTENS
YOUR LIFE.

16:14.467 --> 16:16.200
BAD LUNGS, WEAK HEART,

16:16.200 --> 16:17.400
AND SHORT LIFE.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.300
LOOK, I KNOW,
I KNOW, I KNOW.

16:19.300 --> 16:21.500
THEN WHY ARE YOU
DOING IT, DOING IT,
DOING IT?

16:21.500 --> 16:23.667
WHAT ABOUT
SECONDHAND SMOKE, CORY?

16:23.667 --> 16:25.500
I MEAN, IT'S ONE THING
TO RUIN YOUR OWN BODY,

16:25.500 --> 16:27.567
BUT WHY DOES EVERYBODY ELSE
HAVE TO BREATH THAT POISON?

16:27.567 --> 16:30.934
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

16:30.934 --> 16:31.734
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

16:31.734 --> 16:34.600
BECAUSE
I DON'T SMOKE.

16:34.600 --> 16:35.734
CINDY?

16:35.734 --> 16:36.800
WHAT?

16:36.800 --> 16:38.300
WE CAN'T GET THROUGH TO HIM.

16:38.300 --> 16:40.133
YOU NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.834
OH, RIGHT.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.600
YEAH. MM-HMM.

16:45.300 --> 16:47.734
UM, CORY...

16:47.734 --> 16:49.300
I'M SORRY.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.567
WE ALL ARE, CORY.

16:50.567 --> 16:53.400
LISTEN,
WE CARE ABOUT YOU.

16:53.400 --> 16:56.300
I MEAN, I REMEMBER
WHEN YOU WERE JUST
A LITTLE KID.

16:56.300 --> 16:57.867
FIRST LEARNED HOW
TO USE THE POTTY.

16:57.867 --> 17:00.967
AND NOW LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'RE THROWING
YOUR LIFE DOWN IT.

17:00.967 --> 17:02.500
GET IT TOGETHER, MAN!

17:02.500 --> 17:04.200
GET YOUR HEAD
OUT OF THE TOILET!

17:04.200 --> 17:06.667
YOU KNOW WHAT? FINE.

17:06.667 --> 17:07.934
DON'T BELIEVE ME.

17:07.934 --> 17:10.367
I'M OUT OF HERE.
EXCUSE ME.

17:10.367 --> 17:12.300
THANK YOU.

17:13.033 --> 17:16.767
HEY! GOING SOMEWHERE,
SMOKEY?

17:16.767 --> 17:17.800
THE JUICER.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.400
SORRY, CORY. I HAD
TO BRING IN SOME MUSCLE.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.600
ALL RIGHT, SIT DOWN.

17:22.600 --> 17:25.900
NOW YOU'RE GONNA LISTEN,
AND YOU'RE GONNA LISTEN GOOD.

17:25.900 --> 17:26.834
OK. ALL RIGHT. COOL.

17:26.834 --> 17:29.667
NOW, YOUR SISTER WANTED ME
TO MAKE A LITTLE SPEECH

17:29.667 --> 17:32.100
ABOUT HOW MUCH
YOU MEAN TO ME AS A FRIEND,

17:32.100 --> 17:35.200
BUT I DON'T REALLY DO
SPEECHES

17:35.200 --> 17:37.033
AND YOU'RE NOT REALLY
MY FRIEND.

17:37.033 --> 17:39.767
BUT YOU HAVE BEEN
GROWING ON ME,

17:39.767 --> 17:43.667
AND I DECIDED IF ANY HARM
IS GOING TO COME TO YOU, CORY,

17:43.667 --> 17:45.700
IT'S GONNA COME FROM ME.

17:45.700 --> 17:49.200
NOW, THE FIRST STEP
IN SOLVING ANY PROBLEM

17:49.200 --> 17:51.867
IS ADMITTING THAT
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

17:51.867 --> 17:54.500
FOR INSTANCE,
I HAVE A PROBLEM.

17:54.500 --> 17:57.667
I LOVE SQUEEZING
KIDS' HEADS.

17:57.667 --> 18:00.300
BUT AT LEAST
I ADMIT IT, CORY,

18:00.300 --> 18:02.100
AND YOU NEED TO ADMIT
YOU'RE SMOKING.

18:02.100 --> 18:06.200
SO WE'RE GONNA POOL
OUR PROBLEMS TOGETHER.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.600
I'M GONNA SQUEEZE YOUR HEAD

18:08.600 --> 18:10.934
UNTIL YOU ADMIT
YOU'RE SMOKING...

18:10.934 --> 18:12.600
OR JUICE COMES OUT.

18:12.600 --> 18:15.467
WHICHEVER HAPPENS FIRST.
I DON'T REALLY CARE.

18:15.467 --> 18:18.667
SO, WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,

18:18.667 --> 18:22.033
PLACE HEAD HERE.

18:25.767 --> 18:27.934
YOU KNOW WHAT? FINE.

18:27.934 --> 18:30.000
JUST DO IT FAST.

18:30.600 --> 18:33.033
OH!
NO, WAIT!

18:33.033 --> 18:34.867
CORY'S TELLING THE TRUTH.

18:34.867 --> 18:36.300
I'M THE ONE WHO'S SMOKING.

18:36.300 --> 18:39.900
CINDY, DO NOT TAKE THE BLAME
FOR CORY'S PROBLEM.

18:39.900 --> 18:41.367
NO, IT'S TRUE.

18:41.367 --> 18:42.100
AW, COME ON.

18:42.100 --> 18:43.100
I MEAN, ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE

18:43.100 --> 18:45.767
THAT SWEET LITTLE
INNOCENT CINDY HERE
IS THE ONE SMOKING?

18:45.767 --> 18:48.033
ACTUALLY, EDDIE,
A LOT OF GIRLS NOWADAYS
ARE SMOKING.

18:48.033 --> 18:51.300
THAT'S A NASTY LITTLE HABIT
YOU'VE GOT GOING ON.

18:51.300 --> 18:54.400
I KNOW, AND AFTER
WHAT I'VE HEARD TODAY,

18:54.400 --> 18:57.000
