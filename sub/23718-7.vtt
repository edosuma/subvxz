00:00.001 --> 00:02.755
There is a reason you covet
this negro so well, Governor.

00:02.757 --> 00:04.568
The others look up to Pedro.

00:04.570 --> 00:08.905
England craves tobacco. Imagine when
our fields are full of men such as Pedro.

00:10.942 --> 00:12.707
Yesterday you laughed once.

00:12.709 --> 00:15.300
Today... you laughed twice.

00:15.302 --> 00:17.276
In one year, you will love me.

00:18.126 --> 00:22.540
You will tell me the dealings you've
had with the captain of the Royal Moon.

00:22.542 --> 00:26.872
The arrangement that you made with him
for our tobacco never to reach England.

00:26.874 --> 00:28.475
I did come here to ruin you

00:28.477 --> 00:31.410
but when I saw a man so distressed,

00:31.412 --> 00:33.092
what I felt was pity.

00:33.466 --> 00:35.656
A widow's life is short, Jocelyn.

00:35.719 --> 00:38.679
It is not possible for a
woman to remain here unaided.

00:38.757 --> 00:42.155
Without a husband, a woman simply
has no position in Virginia.

01:16.315 --> 01:21.402
Let us go forth with this cross to
remind us we serve God's purpose here.

01:24.143 --> 01:28.652
What a wondrous day it is, Alice,
to bring the message of the cross.

01:29.160 --> 01:32.788
So that no more evil shades might
trespass upon our settlement.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.761
We could meet in the woods.

01:37.715 --> 01:40.934
- For kissing?
- If that's what you want.

01:41.810 --> 01:42.944
That's what I want.

01:47.361 --> 01:49.574
What are we to do with
all this land, Pedro?

01:50.601 --> 01:56.130
- Farm is, sir.
- True. True. And true again.

01:57.013 --> 02:00.456
This means, Governor, that every man shall
have a piece of earth to plant as his own.

02:00.915 --> 02:03.048
We will need more souls
if we are to conquer it.

02:04.881 --> 02:09.745
I hope that you will...
breed with Maria, hm?

02:11.171 --> 02:13.017
I know how you like to please me.

02:14.036 --> 02:16.751
Let's hope you give
Maria a child, and soon.

02:29.372 --> 02:33.501
- VOICE: Know thyself.
- Know thyself.

02:41.933 --> 02:43.705
What do you suppose you're doing?

02:43.864 --> 02:48.028
Massinger owes us a debt for what
he stole. We're taking payment.

02:48.107 --> 02:50.450
Make your claim and the
court will deal with it.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.225
We predict that all of this
will fall into Yeardley's hands.

02:53.305 --> 02:56.302
So, he's the man that can agree
to settle what is due to us.

02:57.259 --> 03:00.089
If you take these labourers,
it'll be considered a theft.

03:11.138 --> 03:12.193
Jocelyn...

03:13.642 --> 03:17.545
When you speak with the doctor, I hope
you will receive his proposal well.

03:19.298 --> 03:22.319
Dear Governor, I implore that you pity me.

03:22.686 --> 03:25.865
I live in a world where the most
handsome man is already taken.

03:26.575 --> 03:30.768
Authority, courage, experience.

03:31.394 --> 03:35.950
The most manly man. Is it any wonder
that others blemish before you?

03:43.557 --> 03:46.945
The Sharrows have taken every
last negro from Massinger's farm.

03:47.532 --> 03:50.983
They claim them as their right in payment
for Massinger's theft of their tobacco.

03:51.014 --> 03:53.858
They've got brimstone in their
liver, let's give them that.

03:53.897 --> 03:56.579
We will make them kneel before
the seat of judgment, sir.

03:57.618 --> 04:01.363
Let us be in no hurry to
have every ounce of business

04:01.441 --> 04:04.291
regarding Massinger's
land and labour recorded.

04:05.043 --> 04:06.549
I'll deal with the Sharrows.

04:12.473 --> 04:15.182
I was hoping that you would
walk me home, dear Governor.

04:15.549 --> 04:18.963
Your charms, Jocelyn, cannot
erase the common tradition.

04:19.510 --> 04:24.687
If a widow does not remarry, then her
reputation might meet with public sanction.

05:08.804 --> 05:12.402
Their lives will be better here, Alice,
than ever they were at Master Massinger's.

05:52.046 --> 05:53.166
Pedro...

05:53.905 --> 05:59.312
you have never stopped trying
to prove yourself to me.

06:00.320 --> 06:05.684
Every day a little bit, a little bit...

06:06.576 --> 06:09.387
until I trust you.

06:11.958 --> 06:13.958
You are the most beautiful.

06:15.848 --> 06:22.018
Whenever I see you walking, your left
foot is more lovely than your right but...

06:22.058 --> 06:23.678
No, but they are both...

06:24.305 --> 06:26.126
No more talking.

06:57.173 --> 07:00.265
I couldn't help but overhear your
conversation with our Governor.

07:00.457 --> 07:03.671
When a landowner such as Massinger
dies, he has no wife, no children...

07:03.711 --> 07:07.373
Is there no pie you do not
seek to dig your finger into?

07:07.443 --> 07:09.271
The Sharrows have taken
possession of Massinger's

07:09.311 --> 07:10.709
negroes in payment for their losses.

07:10.749 --> 07:12.578
Widow. Widow.

07:12.665 --> 07:16.456
The more you meddle, the more I am amused.

07:17.493 --> 07:20.413
But the land, sir, will it
be returned to the company?

07:25.159 --> 07:27.249
Jocelyn, might I speak with you?

07:27.311 --> 07:29.566
Yes, perhaps tomorrow. I'm about to leave.

07:29.621 --> 07:33.383
- Jocelyn, are you avoiding me?
- I don't know why you say such a thing.

07:33.438 --> 07:35.871
I dare not put off what I
have to say for one day more.

07:36.121 --> 07:37.815
Our Governor spoke to me...

07:38.603 --> 07:40.566
Ma'am? Ma'am?

07:41.338 --> 07:43.698
It's the chill, sir, or the damp.

07:43.912 --> 07:46.072
Or perhaps something else altogether.

07:48.708 --> 07:50.508
Come on. Pull!

07:52.076 --> 07:53.336
Pull! Pull!

07:55.036 --> 07:57.177
Pull! Come on.

07:58.508 --> 07:59.452
Pull!

08:04.642 --> 08:07.945
Do not push a man to the ground
because you believe you own him.

08:08.172 --> 08:11.465
I prod him as I was prodded
so the work might get done.

08:11.512 --> 08:16.538
I see only you taking another living
soul to the ground because you are a brute

08:16.585 --> 08:18.723
who needs to crush every living thing.

08:18.803 --> 08:21.403
Alice, we've lost a whole year's crop.

08:24.466 --> 08:26.372
You've never forgiven me, have you?

08:28.025 --> 08:31.453
- Why should I?
- You were meant to be my wife.

08:33.124 --> 08:35.274
I have named my regret.

08:35.344 --> 08:40.025
It was never true remorse,
not from you. Never.

08:40.566 --> 08:42.241
What will it take, Alice?

08:44.642 --> 08:48.665
Must I swallow my last breath
for you to cease hating me?

08:51.523 --> 08:52.726
Yes.

09:04.026 --> 09:07.825
- To have children is God's work.
- Yes, ma'am.

09:08.531 --> 09:11.385
- Mistress Sharrow is...
- No, I mean you, Maria.

09:11.902 --> 09:14.865
It's a holy purpose that my husband
told Pedro to breed with you.

09:19.899 --> 09:27.197
Did the Governor <i>tell</i>
you to breed with me?

09:27.556 --> 09:28.641
Maria...

09:29.855 --> 09:31.992
No, my eyes have always
seen a most beautiful woman.

09:32.032 --> 09:33.144
Answer me.

09:34.633 --> 09:36.216
Answer me.

09:39.702 --> 09:40.860
He did.

09:48.230 --> 09:51.163
I trusted you.

09:53.738 --> 09:57.071
Maria... Maria...

09:57.111 --> 09:58.151
(SHRIEK)

09:58.191 --> 10:05.446
(SHRIEKS)

10:21.881 --> 10:24.076
(WAILS)

10:24.188 --> 10:25.793
(YELLS)

10:28.347 --> 10:32.802
- What brought the woman to attack Pedro?
- Maria has always had the fiercest humour.

10:32.959 --> 10:36.095
I hope Pedro did not tell her that
I instructed him to breed with her.

10:36.892 --> 10:39.190
- I could not hear the matter of it.
- (YELLS)

10:39.270 --> 10:40.789
I was not close by, I...

10:42.222 --> 10:44.587
but I don't believe that
she meant to harm him so...

10:44.650 --> 10:46.362
The man is dying.

10:47.478 --> 10:51.424
She plunged a knife full into his
gut. Of course she meant to harm him!

10:56.682 --> 10:58.722
I will set every man to search for her.

11:00.709 --> 11:02.112
Then she will tell us.

11:06.196 --> 11:08.558
Pedro looks fearfully sick, Doctor.

11:10.830 --> 11:12.528
What hope does he have?

11:12.568 --> 11:15.558
If the bleeding doesn't kill
him, then the fever will.

11:16.529 --> 11:18.816
You have blood on your Holy book.

11:25.997 --> 11:28.424
(BARKING)

11:28.833 --> 11:32.910
(GROWLING)

11:32.950 --> 11:37.950
If we let one of their kind run,
then others will do the same.

11:38.135 --> 11:41.143
The blackamoor will be caught
and her return and punishment

11:41.183 --> 11:45.814
will show all who see it that
attempting escape is a fatal decision.

11:45.884 --> 11:49.110
You Sharrows are known as masterly hunters.

11:49.697 --> 11:52.470
We are blessed to know that
you will track the negro down.

11:53.005 --> 11:55.550
And once this matter is
sorted, I will have time

11:55.590 --> 11:58.150
to consider your claim
for Massinger's negroes.

12:13.376 --> 12:15.295
I suggest you show loyalty to me at every

12:15.335 --> 12:18.391
opportunity, if you wish
me to favour your petition.

12:22.550 --> 12:24.782
There needs to be order
for farms to prosper.

12:25.071 --> 12:27.443
When we were tenured
men, we laboured our time.

12:28.232 --> 12:29.930
If we had run, then we
would have been called

12:29.970 --> 12:32.572
deserters and hanged if we were caught.

12:32.619 --> 12:35.465
It's the same, Alice.
If we do not help search,

12:35.567 --> 12:38.567
then the Governor will count that
against our right to Massinger's men.

12:39.785 --> 12:41.588
You talk like Henry does.

12:46.652 --> 12:48.652
(PANTING)

13:00.721 --> 13:02.721
(BARKING)

13:20.237 --> 13:24.830
I hope it is not your intention to
aid the runaway, Mistress Rutter?

13:26.956 --> 13:28.746
But if I might chance
upon Maria, sir, I could

13:28.786 --> 13:31.292
persuade her to return and face justice.

13:32.272 --> 13:33.593
Why do you have food?

13:34.459 --> 13:37.147
I plan to leave it for her
to find, Secretary Farlow.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.996
Then it might give her strength to
submit herself to the authorities.

13:41.072 --> 13:43.152
And why are you searching at this spot?

13:44.392 --> 13:47.039
Is there some godless
enchantment at work here?

13:47.171 --> 13:49.216
I see nowt but a few scraps of nothing.

13:50.881 --> 13:51.788
(YELLS)

13:55.457 --> 13:58.417
- Why would you do such a thing?
- Because it pleases me.

14:30.862 --> 14:35.128
Ma'am, when that cross was stood up...

14:36.550 --> 14:39.276
...the sun dazed me...

14:41.276 --> 14:42.820
...and a voice came to me.

14:44.715 --> 14:45.861
It said...

14:46.969 --> 14:49.677
'Know thyself.' That's all.

14:51.147 --> 14:53.088
It brought tears into my eyes.

14:54.088 --> 14:57.395
Know thyself. What does it mean, ma'am?

15:00.198 --> 15:01.884
Know thyself.

15:02.024 --> 15:05.037
There's plenty about Meredith
Rutter ain't worth discovering.

15:05.141 --> 15:08.105
Lies, deceits... cowardnesses...

15:10.338 --> 15:14.755
- I don't want to know myself.
- I don't want to know myself.

15:14.833 --> 15:18.715
Is there an echo in here? I keep
hearing my own words coming back to me.

15:21.206 --> 15:25.555
Well, where am I to find an answer
to such thoughts as these, ma'am?

15:25.916 --> 15:28.356
God's book is where the word lives.

15:49.723 --> 15:51.620
My mistress is sick, sir.

15:51.682 --> 15:55.665
Yes, and I'm her doctor
so I wish to attend her.

15:55.728 --> 16:00.425
- But she's of her bed, sir.
- Mercy, if you let me in,

16:00.471 --> 16:03.032
then I can examine
Mistress Castell of her bed

16:03.072 --> 16:06.232
so that I might determine what ails her.

16:10.218 --> 16:11.663
Surely, sir.

16:23.716 --> 16:26.676
Why she lay there smit with
affliction only moments ago.

16:34.523 --> 16:35.932
Secretary Farlow.

16:39.664 --> 16:42.035
I am glad to see you so restored, sir.

16:42.188 --> 16:45.475
After your encounter with roughhouse.

16:46.163 --> 16:49.549
A pleasantry from you
makes my bowel shiver.

16:49.634 --> 16:50.940
What do you want?

16:51.787 --> 16:53.747
I want Master Massinger's land.

16:56.444 --> 17:02.882
Ah, see how the air itself sparkles
to life when true nature is expressed.

17:03.562 --> 17:05.336
I have the cause and the justification.

17:05.376 --> 17:07.262
Massinger killed my husband.

17:07.340 --> 17:10.290
What I do not yet have are
the means to persuade...

17:10.867 --> 17:13.748
the Governor to sign
the contract over to me.

17:15.795 --> 17:17.877
I want you to persuade our governor.

17:19.705 --> 17:22.652
I have no misgivings about
this course except one.

17:23.608 --> 17:25.647
It would make me an ally to you

17:26.844 --> 17:30.568
and that thought puts yesterday's
breakfast back into my throat.

17:31.341 --> 17:32.866
Do you think I would make such an approach

17:32.906 --> 17:35.114
without naming a benefit
and a business for you?

17:36.222 --> 17:39.379
I would own the land, I
would profit from its yield

17:39.419 --> 17:41.794
and you will be my secret
partner in the enterprise.

17:42.476 --> 17:45.761
- What percentage would I have?
- Half.

17:48.607 --> 17:51.107
If I were to help you gain the plantation,

17:51.947 --> 17:53.928
why should I trust you to keep your word?

17:54.217 --> 17:57.625
Oh, but, sir, I see that the
possibility of dark dealings

17:57.688 --> 18:01.105
and political betrayal are already
intoxicating to your senses.

18:02.831 --> 18:04.831
I will consider your proposal.

18:32.830 --> 18:35.910
- What's the matter with your ale?
- I don't like the taste of it.

18:40.500 --> 18:43.584
What are you doing with the Bible?

18:44.077 --> 18:45.129
Seeking.

18:46.567 --> 18:49.674
What could you seek in the
pages of a book, you wantwit?

18:50.784 --> 18:52.259
You can't read.

18:54.119 --> 18:58.245
I can't seem to shake
them words out of my brain.

19:00.703 --> 19:04.983
Know thyself. Know thyself.

19:08.405 --> 19:10.405
I have to follow it where it takes me.

19:17.811 --> 19:18.956
She was here.

19:28.349 --> 19:29.498
Yesterday.

19:31.205 --> 19:35.559
We might be seen to search but
not well enough that we find Maria.

19:36.398 --> 19:37.351
Henry?

19:38.635 --> 19:43.631
Alice will settle. Our
family have known peace.

19:44.506 --> 19:45.748
We will know it again.

19:48.075 --> 19:53.715
I don't blame Alice. She's not
the only one who can't forgive me.

19:54.608 --> 19:56.709
If your own soul torments you...

19:57.703 --> 20:02.115
Not me, brother, you.

20:38.616 --> 20:41.110
(GASPS)

20:42.310 --> 20:44.310
(YELLS)

20:47.626 --> 20:49.626
Help!

21:00.484 --> 21:02.484
(YELLS)

21:21.249 --> 21:23.289
It was me who said to bring her here.

21:25.709 --> 21:28.730
You did right, Pepper. Take her inside.

21:36.387 --> 21:39.682
- You have black men in your field.
- Yes.

21:40.914 --> 21:42.030
Yes, we do.

21:45.606 --> 21:47.193
Chacrow, I know it was you who returned my

21:47.233 --> 21:50.999
baby to me and now you bring Maria here.

21:52.696 --> 21:54.420
I will repay you if I can.

21:54.581 --> 21:58.307
Silas says Sharrows owe
no more debts to Pamunkey.

21:59.689 --> 22:01.689
Then I say to you that I do.

22:03.450 --> 22:05.458
I am ready to repay you.

22:12.820 --> 22:16.244
A woman, a blackamoor...

22:17.020 --> 22:20.700
took a knife to my valuable servant.

22:21.814 --> 22:27.814
A witless girl and yet you
huntsmen failed to scout her out.

22:28.770 --> 22:31.341
Is your manhood so weak?

22:32.118 --> 22:36.118
Perhaps she's been given shelter. I
have good reason to inspect the tavern.

22:36.810 --> 22:39.132
How many miles of wilderness
are there out there?

22:39.172 --> 22:41.539
She might keep going till
she's never seen again.

22:41.696 --> 22:44.336
- Deserters are punished.
- Most of them dead.

22:46.431 --> 22:49.071
What about the naturals?
Could she be with them?

22:49.488 --> 22:52.860
The signs we saw were that she
rested close by in the woods.

22:53.431 --> 22:57.126
If she intended to go as far as
the mountains, she'd keep moving.

22:58.723 --> 23:04.660
I'd say she was confused, afraid...
didn't know what she was doing.

23:05.388 --> 23:06.544
Find her.

23:19.625 --> 23:23.905
You're safe here, Maria. I don't
know how but we will help you.

23:24.555 --> 23:26.959
I killed Pedro.

23:29.117 --> 23:32.877
- I saw so much blood.
- Pedro is not dead.

23:34.281 --> 23:36.660
He may not live but he's not dead yet.

23:40.257 --> 23:41.577
Why, Maria?

23:42.750 --> 23:44.008
Why did you do it?

23:46.165 --> 23:50.220
The Governor told Pedro
he must breed with me.

23:52.665 --> 23:57.425
I believed that Pedro was lying with
me because the Governor told him to.

24:04.145 --> 24:06.954
There is no reason to
defy the Governor. We've a

24:06.994 --> 24:10.838
chance, do you not see, to
get back what we have lost.

24:10.878 --> 24:12.838
To keep Massinger's men.

24:12.878 --> 24:15.024
How long can she hide like this?

24:15.555 --> 24:18.660
- A day? A week? A year?
- What would you have me do?

24:18.700 --> 24:20.904
Hand her over when you know
what will happen to her.

24:20.944 --> 24:25.061
- She took a knife to a man.
- So did I once!

24:25.968 --> 24:28.335
And I was lucky my strength failed me.

24:28.413 --> 24:32.940
I only cut him. I could not
plunge it into him as I wanted to.

24:35.397 --> 24:37.757
I will not give Maria up.

24:38.831 --> 24:40.127
Do you hear me?

24:41.822 --> 24:43.415
I refuse.

24:51.376 --> 24:54.845
If you were a runaway, Secretary Farlow,

24:55.173 --> 24:56.987
would you hide yourself in the tavern?

24:58.021 --> 25:02.421
Even my own softbrain of a husband would
gallop until he had no feet left on him.

25:03.529 --> 25:07.260
- What are you doing, Rutter?
- Sir.

25:08.064 --> 25:09.468
You're a man of the Bible.

25:10.690 --> 25:14.183
Since I have no reading, might you
answer me a question of this book?

25:17.441 --> 25:21.497
- Know thyself.
- That is the question?

25:21.537 --> 25:23.497
As my tongue is in my soul, sir.

25:25.745 --> 25:28.625
Do I see that you are sober, Rutter?

26:15.627 --> 26:18.749
It must have been most distressing for you,

26:18.789 --> 26:22.219

witnessed such savagery.

26:22.623 --> 26:25.983
To have blood on your
hands and your dress...

And yet, there is a shroud of...

26:36.312 --> 26:41.927
If I lose Pedro, I'll be robbed of more
than just sweat and labouring hands.

26:42.864 --> 26:45.025
The man has a purpose for me.

26:45.591 --> 26:48.031
To teach others like
himself that they belong.

26:48.869 --> 26:53.380
To persuade them to
toil without question...

26:54.695 --> 26:56.128
Do not talk.

27:08.719 --> 27:11.959
Did you tell Maria that I
instructed Pedro to breed with her?

27:12.055 --> 27:14.274
No. No. No.

27:15.122 --> 27:19.983
I did not know. No, I
promise you. I promise you.

28:22.438 --> 28:26.918
I must warn you, it cannot
be achieved with cunning.

28:27.851 --> 28:31.952
It can only be accomplished by
direct confrontation with Yeardley.

28:34.476 --> 28:39.735
Widow, is it that you fear the
pale life of a doctor's wife

28:39.775 --> 28:42.636
that makes you resist
remarrying so resolutely?

28:43.577 --> 28:45.940
Tell me how I might possess the farm.

28:46.956 --> 28:48.980
The previous Governor, Argyle,

28:49.784 --> 28:54.097
sold the land to Master Massinger
without the permission of the company.

28:54.158 --> 28:56.118
Yeardley knows that.

28:56.712 --> 29:02.147
Should this fact be exposed, the
Virginia Company will reclaim it all.

29:02.780 --> 29:04.705
Should the corruption remain out of view...

29:04.778 --> 29:08.860
Yeardley might concoct a contract
between himself and Massinger

29:09.220 --> 29:11.965
and the entire transaction
would remain out of view.

29:12.925 --> 29:16.300
This gives you the means by
which to challenge Yeardley.

It is an instruction that we do not set

It's a risk, girl, especially since
he... might not live to hear it.

You would come to my aid if
it was me who used the blade.
