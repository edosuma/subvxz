WEBVTT

00:04.204 --> 00:06.772
One week till our sweet 16.

00:06.774 --> 00:08.240
After four years
of being apart,

00:08.242 --> 00:10.609
we are finally together
on our birthday.

00:10.611 --> 00:14.780
I know! We get to blow out
our candles together again.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.248
The three Rooney girls,

00:16.250 --> 00:18.517
together again
and ready to ¶ party!

00:18.519 --> 00:20.519
¶ Whoo whoo whoo, party!
I said now party! ¶

00:20.521 --> 00:23.022
don't turn around. You don't want to
know what mom's doing behind you.

00:23.024 --> 00:27.192
I don't need to. I can feel the
desperation on the back of my neck.

00:29.062 --> 00:31.964
All right, fine.
Guess I'll just save my moves

00:31.966 --> 00:36.101
- for the par-tay!
- Back that party up over here, care bear.

00:36.103 --> 00:39.304
- Here we go.
- ( Vocalizing, chanting )

00:39.306 --> 00:41.840
<i>¶ Left left left,</i>
<i>to the right right right... ¶</i>

00:41.842 --> 00:44.243
anyway.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.545
So for our party,
I had a few thoughts.

00:46.547 --> 00:47.880
( Squeals )

00:51.951 --> 00:53.819
I had...

00:56.089 --> 00:58.290
<i>A </i> thought.

00:58.292 --> 01:01.660
Ahem, okay, so I'm thinking

01:01.662 --> 01:03.395
red carpet, designer gowns,

01:03.397 --> 01:06.965
we enter cirque-du-soleil
style, spiraling in on silks.

01:06.967 --> 01:08.333
( Squeals )

01:08.335 --> 01:10.736
I'm thinking

01:10.738 --> 01:13.572
peanut shells on the floor,
steaks the size of our heads,

01:13.574 --> 01:18.610
we enter hungry-man style
in our casual eating pants.

01:19.345 --> 01:21.080
Ahem.
Maddie,

01:21.082 --> 01:24.316
this is our big 1-6.
It needs to be epic.

01:24.318 --> 01:26.685
I know!
And I'm thinking epic.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.221
There's this new
cowboy-jail-themed restaurant,

01:29.223 --> 01:32.357
- the hoosegow.
- Wow!

01:32.359 --> 01:34.226
Ha ha.

01:34.228 --> 01:36.795
We have very different
ideas of epic.

01:37.897 --> 01:39.264
You know what's epic?

01:39.266 --> 01:42.367
Mini-golf
birthday parties!

01:42.369 --> 01:44.837
They worked for years
for you two.

01:44.839 --> 01:47.873
- Ages six to 11, done!
- Yes yes, dad's right.

01:47.875 --> 01:50.309
Maddie, you loved it
because it was sporty.

01:50.311 --> 01:53.345
And, Liv, there was a castle, so you
could dress up like a princess.

01:53.347 --> 01:57.316
And I loved it because you two were
together celebrating your birthday.

01:57.318 --> 02:00.719
So, Rooney girls,
let's get ready to ¶ par-tay!

02:00.721 --> 02:03.755
¶ Whoo whoo whoo, party!
I said now party! ¶

02:03.757 --> 02:05.290
mom!
Mom, mom.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.893
Stop.

02:07.895 --> 02:09.361
Hater.

02:12.332 --> 02:15.300
As fun as mini-golf was,

02:15.302 --> 02:18.837
we are turning 16 now, so
we can plan our own party.

02:18.839 --> 02:21.974
So let's just talk this out because
nothing's been set in stone.

02:21.976 --> 02:26.345
Liv, I picked up the silks
for your epic party entrance.

02:28.781 --> 02:32.251
Epically bad decision to bring
them home on my bike.

02:34.387 --> 02:36.989
The silks have already
been ordered?

02:36.991 --> 02:39.992
You've already planned our
entire party, haven't you?

02:39.994 --> 02:42.060
Well, it's not like
I could leave it up to you!

02:42.062 --> 02:45.297
- I mean, casual eating pants?!
- Spiraling in on silks?!

02:45.299 --> 02:48.667
- You're being impossible!
- Ugh, I wish we could just have separate birthdays!

02:48.669 --> 02:50.102
- Ugh!
- Ugh!

03:01.347 --> 03:03.282
A little help?

03:04.217 --> 03:06.218
<i>( Theme music playing )</i>

03:06.220 --> 03:07.920
<i>¶ Better in stereo</i>

03:07.922 --> 03:10.155
<i>¶ b... b... better in stereo</i>

03:10.157 --> 03:12.157
- <i>¶ I'm up with the sunshine</i>
<i>- ¶ Let's go</i>

03:12.159 --> 03:14.193
- <i>¶ I lace up my high tops</i>
<i>- ¶ Oh no</i>

03:14.195 --> 03:16.361
<i>¶ slam dunk, ready or not ¶</i>

03:16.363 --> 03:18.397
<i>¶ yeah, show me what you got ¶</i>

03:18.399 --> 03:21.066
- ¶ I'm under the spotlight
- <i>¶ Holler</i>

03:21.068 --> 03:23.168
<i>¶ I dare you,</i>
<i>come on and follow ¶</i>

03:23.170 --> 03:25.170
<i>¶ you dance to your own beat ¶</i>

03:25.172 --> 03:26.905
<i>¶ I'll sing the melody</i>

03:26.907 --> 03:28.941
<i>¶ when you say yea-ah-ah</i>

03:28.943 --> 03:31.343
<i>¶ I say no-oh-oh</i>

03:31.345 --> 03:33.312
<i>¶ when you say stop</i>

03:33.314 --> 03:35.714
<i>¶ all I want to do</i>

03:35.716 --> 03:39.084
¶ you you,

03:39.086 --> 03:41.253
<i>¶ the half I'll never be-e</i>

03:41.255 --> 03:44.289
<i>¶ the half</i>
<i>that drives me crazy ¶</i>

03:44.291 --> 03:47.893
<i>¶ you you,</i>
<i>the better half of me me ¶</i>

03:47.895 --> 03:49.895
<i>¶ the half I'll always need</i>

03:49.897 --> 03:51.897
<i>¶ but we both know</i>

03:51.899 --> 03:53.899
<i>¶ we're better in stereo.</i>

03:58.071 --> 04:01.907
My twins can't have separate
parties on their sweet 16th.

04:01.909 --> 04:05.310
So while you two were
at Maddie's basketball game,

04:05.312 --> 04:07.412
I came up
with a "mompromise."

04:07.414 --> 04:10.749
( Giggles ) So take a look.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.786
Dazzleberry!

04:15.521 --> 04:17.389
Awesome!

04:18.358 --> 04:20.292
Hold on, you haven't
seen the best part.

04:20.294 --> 04:22.828
- Turn around.
- ( Gasps )

04:22.830 --> 04:25.464
Two themes, one party.

04:25.466 --> 04:29.067
It's a red carpet rodeo!

04:29.069 --> 04:32.004
- ( Feedback crackles )
- Hey, why isn't this thing working?

04:32.006 --> 04:34.773
So, Maddie honey, you wanted
to go to the hoosegow.

04:34.775 --> 04:38.210
So we're gonna have a Western
barbecue right here in the house.

04:38.212 --> 04:39.945
- Joey.
- Mom, I don't want to say it.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.413
Oh, come on, say it.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.415
( Weakly )
Yee-haw.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.083
( Laughs )

04:45.085 --> 04:48.387
And, Liv, you wanted
a cirque-du-soleil,

04:48.389 --> 04:50.555
red carpet gala.
I bring you

04:50.557 --> 04:53.358
- parkerazzi!
- Liv Rooney, Liv Rooney!

04:53.360 --> 04:55.127
Who are you wearing?

04:55.129 --> 04:58.297
( Laughs ) Boom boom boom!

04:58.299 --> 05:00.232
Send.
( Squeals )

05:00.234 --> 05:03.435
Mom, this is great!
And I think we're halfway there.

05:03.437 --> 05:06.305
The half that doesn't
look like a barn. So...

05:06.307 --> 05:08.573
I think we should clear out
these hay bales

05:08.575 --> 05:11.310
and, uh, oooh,
all the barbecuey stuff.

05:11.312 --> 05:14.413
And I just really want to, you know,
class this place up, you know?

05:14.415 --> 05:16.381
I think we're gonna bring in
some French contortionists...

05:16.383 --> 05:19.418
Liv, why are you throwing
out everything that I like?

05:19.420 --> 05:21.420
I thought this was our party.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.956
Honey, it's time to come clean.

05:24.958 --> 05:27.359
- ( Sighs )
- We've kept the secret for too long.

05:27.361 --> 05:31.430
- ( Mic clicks on )
- ...They were born on separate days.

05:36.102 --> 05:39.304
¶ Camptown ladies sing
that song, doo-dah doo-dah. ¶

05:39.306 --> 05:42.007
this karaoke thing works great.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.910
Who's next?

05:44.912 --> 05:47.913
- What did you just say?
- We have different birthdays?

05:47.915 --> 05:49.948
Girls, your mother and I

05:49.950 --> 05:51.550
have something to tell you.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.519
Go ahead.

05:57.490 --> 06:00.258
Liv and Maddie,
the day you were born

06:00.260 --> 06:02.928
was truly the greatest
day of my life.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.430
Well, that feels nice.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.235
But it was actually
the "days" you were born.

06:10.237 --> 06:14.373
You see, Liv, you were born
on the fifth at 11:56 P.M.

06:14.375 --> 06:17.109
But, Maddie honey,
you were born

06:17.111 --> 06:20.512
at 12:02 on the sixth.

06:20.514 --> 06:23.448
But the whole reason that
five is my lucky number

06:23.450 --> 06:25.117
is 'cause I was born
on the fifth.

06:25.119 --> 06:26.918
I'm a five.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.355
Apparently I'm a zero.

06:31.424 --> 06:34.025
Wait, so Maddie's
never celebrated

06:34.027 --> 06:35.994
on her actual birthday?

06:37.530 --> 06:40.165
What kind of parents are you?

06:42.201 --> 06:45.404
This is preposterous.
I say again preposterous.

06:46.606 --> 06:48.340
If they can do this to her,

06:48.342 --> 06:50.308
what does that mean
for everybody else?

06:50.310 --> 06:52.411
Am I six?
Am I 11?

06:52.413 --> 06:54.413
I could be nine!

06:58.951 --> 07:00.485
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:04.123 --> 07:06.458
Maddie honey, I am so sorry.

07:06.460 --> 07:09.060
Every year your birthday
would roll around

07:09.062 --> 07:10.662
and I would just get so excited

07:10.664 --> 07:13.465
at the two of you sitting together
blowing out your candles.

07:13.467 --> 07:16.468
Then why did you use those trick
candles that didn't blow out?

07:18.604 --> 07:20.939
We wanted the moment
to last forever.

07:22.308 --> 07:25.977
Plus a joint birthday party
is double the fun.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.647
It's also half the work.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.616
See, I'm trying to be completely
honest with you from now on.

07:33.619 --> 07:37.155
Don't try and be funny. I'm
still trying to be mad at you.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.690
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.525
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

07:40.527 --> 07:43.361
You know, when you and Liv were
little, you were inseparable.

07:43.363 --> 07:46.965
As your mother, it just felt wrong
to take that special day away.

07:46.967 --> 07:50.302
Are you seriously trying to take credit
for being a good mother right now?

07:50.304 --> 07:51.703
Yes, I tried to slip that in.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.640
Now just tell me what you
want to do for your birthday

07:55.642 --> 07:58.477
and your father and I will make
it happen... sky's the limit.

07:58.479 --> 08:01.646
Okay, there is a budget. See, I'm
trying to be totally honest.

08:02.081 --> 08:03.182
Thanks, mom, but...

08:03.183 --> 08:08.086
honestly the last thing I feel like doing
right now is celebrating my birthday.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.355
I don't even think I want to
have a party at all this year.

08:10.357 --> 08:13.492
- And I'm sure Liv feels the exact same way.
- Well, think about it.

08:13.494 --> 08:17.229
In the meantime I made your
favorite dinner: Chicken pot pie.

08:17.231 --> 08:20.332
Okay, I didn't make it.
It was frozen from a box.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.334
Whoo, the truth
really will set you free!

08:26.472 --> 08:28.206
Okay, everyone find a seat.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.742
Maddie's off on a jog,
but I bought us some time.

08:30.744 --> 08:34.613
She always jogs till the end of her
playlist so I added six songs.

08:34.615 --> 08:37.716
- Hey, Joey, I got a spot for you right here.
- ( Groans )

08:39.585 --> 08:41.486
I am going to say yes

08:41.488 --> 08:43.555
because I am scared to say no.

08:48.394 --> 08:52.330
Okay, you are all here because you
are Maddie's best friends and family

08:52.332 --> 08:55.500
and I want you to help me to
throw a surprise party for her.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.302
You have to keep it a secret.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.538
I know that won't be
a problem for you two.

09:01.507 --> 09:04.509
( Breathily ) Mom said Maddie doesn't
even want a party this year.

09:04.511 --> 09:07.245
Also I cannot feel my ribs.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.482
I can!

09:12.251 --> 09:14.786
Maddie says she doesn't want a
party, but I know my sister better.

09:14.788 --> 09:17.389
This birthday shocker has
knocked her for a loop

09:17.391 --> 09:19.791
- and we are going to fix it.
- That's very sweet.

09:19.793 --> 09:22.527
- We'll do anything to help.
- Of course you will.

09:22.529 --> 09:24.563
You're totally
on the hook for this.

09:26.265 --> 09:30.168
Well, I'm in. I want Maddie's sweet
16 to be as amazing as it can be.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.203
- Careful.
- Right, sorry.

09:33.507 --> 09:37.208
I want you to take Maddie
to the hoosegow Saturday night

09:37.210 --> 09:38.643
while the rest of us get
the house ready for the party.

09:38.645 --> 09:41.179
( Claps ) Don't bring her
home until midnight though,

09:41.181 --> 09:42.781
because that's when
her actual birthday begins.

09:42.783 --> 09:45.116
Oh, midnight? Isn't that
awfully late for a party?

09:45.118 --> 09:46.418
You mean like...

09:46.420 --> 09:48.320
16 years late, mom?

09:50.089 --> 09:51.590
Midnight party... fun.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.525
( Squeals )

09:57.496 --> 09:59.464
Hey, mads, what are you doing?

09:59.466 --> 10:01.700
I am turning all my lucky fives

10:01.702 --> 10:03.768
into sixes.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.137
Turns out the first
15 years of my life

10:06.139 --> 10:08.173
I stuck fives everywhere.

10:08.175 --> 10:09.808
( Laughs )

10:09.810 --> 10:12.277
( Bitterly ) Everywhere.

10:13.679 --> 10:16.314
Identity crisis...
I can relate.

10:16.316 --> 10:19.384
I remember the tough transition
from Joseph to Joe

10:19.386 --> 10:22.554
to Joey, with a brief stint
as baby "j."

10:23.589 --> 10:25.523
Then ultimately back to Joey.

10:25.525 --> 10:29.160
- Wasn't there a j-dog in there somewhere?
- Do not bring that up!

10:29.162 --> 10:30.795
Okay.

10:32.531 --> 10:34.366
Maddie and Joey Rooney?

10:34.368 --> 10:36.534
Character from my nightmares?

10:36.536 --> 10:38.169
Delivery.

10:41.407 --> 10:44.142
"You are cordially invited
to the cirque-du-soleil

10:44.144 --> 10:48.613
red carpet gala celebrating
the sweet 16 of Liv Rooney."

10:48.615 --> 10:51.316
Liv's throwing a party
for herself?!

10:51.318 --> 10:53.885
The invitations
pretzel-butt was handing out

10:53.887 --> 10:56.421
were for a fake party to throw
Maddie off the scent.

10:56.423 --> 10:59.691
My job was to twist the knife
ever so delicately.

10:59.693 --> 11:02.360
( Whispers )
I have a gentle touch.

11:02.362 --> 11:07.766
Liv took this whole birthday
scandal a lot better than you did.

11:07.768 --> 11:10.268
A lot better.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.170
A... lot.

11:13.406 --> 11:16.274
I can't believe she just
dumped me to do her own thing!

11:16.276 --> 11:18.643
Yeah.
Does that make you mad?

11:18.645 --> 11:20.645
I bet I'd be mad.

11:20.647 --> 11:23.815
I'd be, like, really mad.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.484
You know what?

11:26.486 --> 11:28.653
If Liv's throwing
a party for herself,

11:28.655 --> 11:30.689
I'm throwing a party
for myself.

11:30.691 --> 11:33.291
- I'm going to the hoosegow.
- ( Slams )

11:33.293 --> 11:36.361
Oh okay, here comes Maddie.
Remember we have plans on Sunday.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.830
Hey, guys, do you want
to go out for my birthday?

11:38.832 --> 11:40.365
Hoosegow on Sunday,
what do you say?

11:40.367 --> 11:43.234
Can't, we have plans on Sunday.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.402
What plans?

11:44.404 --> 11:45.937
I... I've got a, um,

11:45.939 --> 11:48.573
uh... a drum circle.
( Chuckling )

11:50.509 --> 11:52.777
Washing my ferret.

11:54.413 --> 11:55.714
Book club?

11:58.350 --> 12:00.318
You're in a book club?

12:00.320 --> 12:02.754
Sure. Yeah, you know, every
month we pick a book

12:02.756 --> 12:04.222
and then...

12:04.224 --> 12:06.391
we watch the movie
and talk about it.

12:08.461 --> 12:11.229
Well, we're available Saturday.

12:11.231 --> 12:14.466
Saturday? Aren't you guys
going to Liv's party?

12:14.468 --> 12:17.235
Not invited. Guess we
didn't make the cut.

12:17.237 --> 12:20.605
Liv's loss... we're the cool kids.
( Sniffs )

12:22.675 --> 12:26.511
Liv's throwing a party for herself and
she didn't even invite my friends.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.546
You know what?

12:28.548 --> 12:31.783
I am free Saturday.
I'm going to the hoosegow.

12:31.785 --> 12:33.284
Yes!

12:33.286 --> 12:35.553
Snap!
The jaws of my traptastic plan

12:35.555 --> 12:37.021
had closed.
( Giggles )

12:37.023 --> 12:40.024
Maddie hated me.
Hello, best sister ¶ ever!

12:40.026 --> 12:41.459
( Squeals )

12:43.496 --> 12:45.430
There you go, little lady.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.798
Now you are welcome

12:46.800 --> 12:49.534
to as many return visits
to the salad bar

12:49.536 --> 12:50.969
as you want at the hoosegow.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.938
But only under
the watchful eye of the law.

12:56.008 --> 12:57.776
"Watchful eye"?
Hardly!

12:57.778 --> 13:00.278
I filled my whole purse
with baby corn.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.046
Don't mess
with sheriff Tim, willow.

13:02.048 --> 13:04.015
He's packing ketchup
and mustard.

13:06.452 --> 13:09.287
Dude, whatever Liv is doing
at her stupid red carpet party

13:09.289 --> 13:10.889
cannot be nearly
as cool as this.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.590
I mean I'd much rather
be at a place

13:12.592 --> 13:14.692
where you can throw your
peanut shells on the floor.

13:14.694 --> 13:16.294
And rib bones.

13:20.032 --> 13:22.000
Am I not supposed to do that?

13:22.935 --> 13:25.470
Always the lady, stains.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.405
Always the lady.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.374
( Triangle rings )

13:29.376 --> 13:31.376
Oooh, guys, they're gonna
arrest someone again.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.578
You are under arrest!
Cattle rustling,

13:33.580 --> 13:37.682
stagecoach robbery and spitting
in the presence of a lady.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.517
All:
Oooh!

13:39.519 --> 13:41.853
- Lock him up!
- All: Lock him up!

13:41.855 --> 13:43.721
- ( Laughs )
- <i>( Phone ringing )</i>

13:43.723 --> 13:45.557
Oh, I gotta take this.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.362
This is jailhouse one.
Over.

13:51.364 --> 13:52.964
- Diggie, how's it going?
- It's great.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.532
We're just about
to order dessert.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.534
- She doesn't suspect a thing.
- Dessert?!

13:56.536 --> 13:59.370
You can't be on dessert already.
It's barely 10:00!

13:59.372 --> 14:02.473
You need to keep her out
of the house until midnight.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.742
I mean, yeah, I'll do what
I can, but I didn't expect

14:04.744 --> 14:07.378
service to be this fantastic
at a restaurant like this.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.781
Diggie, I am trying to do
something nice for my sister.

14:09.783 --> 14:11.983
Do not make me regret
trusting you.

14:13.752 --> 14:17.355
The fate of my plan
rests on someone named diggie.

14:19.592 --> 14:22.393
- We gotta stall for time.
- Not a prob.

14:22.395 --> 14:25.530
Stains is doing the rotisserie
chicken stockade challenge.

14:26.432 --> 14:28.633
( Chomping )

14:30.603 --> 14:32.403
Willow: <i>If you can eat a whole
chicken in under an hour,</i>

14:32.405 --> 14:34.839
you get a free t-shirt.
( Laughs )

14:34.841 --> 14:36.507
Come on, come on, come on!

14:36.509 --> 14:38.776
( Panting ) Wipe.

14:38.778 --> 14:42.113
Uh, you know what? Let's just
hose you off when this is over.

14:48.854 --> 14:51.556
A one-layer cake?
Really?

14:51.558 --> 14:55.526
You think that's gonna make up
for 16 years of fibs and fraud?

14:57.429 --> 15:00.465
I was going to put little purple
frosting flowers on the corners.

15:00.467 --> 15:03.001
That will impress...
No one.

15:04.436 --> 15:07.038
Well, I suppose I could
do a few more layers.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.506
Oh yeah!

15:08.508 --> 15:10.541
Maybe one
for each year you lied.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.419
Wow, this mini-golf course

15:21.421 --> 15:23.521
actually looks pretty good.

15:23.523 --> 15:27.692
I'm glad someone's paying attention
to what Liv's trying to pull off.

15:27.694 --> 15:30.995
- Let's see the windmill spin.
- Oh, it doesn't actually spin.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.497
Yeah, no, it's decorative,

15:32.499 --> 15:34.666
like the treadmill
in mom and dad's bedroom.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.969
Are you kidding me?

15:37.971 --> 15:41.005
A crummy cake
and a non-spinning windmill?

15:41.007 --> 15:44.642
Liv is trying is recreate the
mini-golf parties of Maddie's youth.

15:44.644 --> 15:47.578
And if we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do this right.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.481
I guess we could take apart
one of my remote-controlled cars

15:50.483 --> 15:52.483
and use the motor
from that to make it spin.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.218
Yeah, we could do that.
We can also play

15:54.220 --> 15:56.921
duck, duck, goose.
Am I the only one that cares?

15:59.458 --> 16:01.626
We could take apart
the riding mower

16:01.628 --> 16:04.062
and use the motor
from that bad boy.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.830
Now we're talking.

16:05.832 --> 16:09.634
Birthday magic, monkeys.
Let's go, let's go!

16:10.569 --> 16:11.903
Where are you going?

16:11.905 --> 16:14.772
It's already two hours
past my bedtime.

16:14.774 --> 16:18.009
If I don't take a nap before the party,
I'm going to be a real crankypants.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.681
Good job, stains.

16:23.683 --> 16:27.118
I have never been more
impressed or disgusted.

16:28.954 --> 16:32.490
And you know you didn't have to eat
the bones to win the shirt, right?

16:33.225 --> 16:34.892
When I commit, I commit, man.

16:36.495 --> 16:39.097
We hear it's your
birthday, little lady.

16:40.232 --> 16:42.567
Uh, it's not my actual
birthday till midnight.

16:42.569 --> 16:45.670
Well, blow out the candle.
It's somebody's birthday.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.607
Go ahead, Maddie, make a wish.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.843
Guys, I can't.

16:51.845 --> 16:54.512
Sheriff Tim was right.
It is somebody's birthday.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.280
It's Liv's

16:56.282 --> 16:58.583
and the only wish that
popped into my head

16:58.585 --> 17:01.686
was that I wish we were blowing
out our candles together, so.

17:01.688 --> 17:04.589
That's so sweet.
Let's get you home right now.

17:08.660 --> 17:10.695
Uh... ( Laughs, claps ) Get up.

17:10.697 --> 17:13.965
Well, are you sure?
We've...

17:13.967 --> 17:16.601
- barely been here for four hours.
- <i>( Bell ringing )</i>

17:16.603 --> 17:20.004
- You are under arrest... cattle rustling.
- Wait!

17:20.006 --> 17:21.305
You're arresting
the wrong bandit.

17:21.307 --> 17:23.541
This girl here,
she's the cattle rustler.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.276
Yeah, man, lock her up!

17:25.278 --> 17:28.546
( Chanting )
Lock her up, lock her up!

17:28.548 --> 17:30.648
- Lock her up!
- Maddie: Guys!

17:30.650 --> 17:34.986
Guys, let me out! I need to get
to Liv's party before it's over!

17:34.988 --> 17:36.821
Good move, diggie.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.823
I'm smooth under pressure.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.992
There's a new sheriff in town

17:40.994 --> 17:43.728
and his name is diggie and
he's the meanest sheriff on...

17:43.730 --> 17:45.696
( shouts )

17:47.032 --> 17:48.299
We're outta here.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.701
Well... go!
Maddie, wait.

17:56.608 --> 17:59.310
Mr. and Mrs. Joey
and willow Rooney.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.650
( Groans ) It's midnight!

18:05.652 --> 18:08.086
Seriously, diggie,
16 wrong turns?

18:10.656 --> 18:12.190
And I've never heard
of that law

18:12.192 --> 18:14.592
that says you have to go
5mph past a graveyard?

18:14.594 --> 18:17.061
That's just showing
respect, man.

18:19.031 --> 18:20.731
Wait a second,
I don't hear music.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.700
And the red carpet
is rolled up.

18:22.702 --> 18:25.169
You guys, I missed
Liv's birthday!

18:27.973 --> 18:30.174
Su...

18:30.176 --> 18:33.211
upper was really great
at the hoosegow.

18:35.681 --> 18:36.948
Where is everybody?

18:41.620 --> 18:44.088
Surprise!

18:45.324 --> 18:48.326
We missed saying surprise.
Are you kidding me?

18:52.197 --> 18:54.098
Happy sweet 16, Maddie.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.634
Wait, this is all for me?

18:56.636 --> 18:58.903
- Where is your red carpet party?
- Oh. ( Laughs )

18:58.905 --> 19:01.239
There was no party.
I totally played you.

19:01.241 --> 19:04.342
Don't feel bad though,
I am a day older.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.377
- ( Laughs )
- Diggie: Ahem.

19:08.347 --> 19:11.415
Hey, remember us, the people
you were screaming at

19:11.417 --> 19:13.284
the whole way past
the graveyard?

19:13.286 --> 19:15.086
You guys were all in on this?

19:17.156 --> 19:19.857
Liv, mini-golf?

19:19.859 --> 19:21.893
It's just like old times.

19:21.895 --> 19:24.896
We got so wrapped up in which
kind of party we each wanted

19:24.898 --> 19:27.398
that we forgot the best part
is doing it together.

19:28.867 --> 19:31.402
¶ Someone made you
a cake! ¶

19:31.404 --> 19:35.406
- ( Liv squeals )
- Guys, a basketball cake?

19:35.408 --> 19:37.208
This is amazing.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.710
16 layers
of buttercream and guilt.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.846
Mama's done her time.
We're moving on.

19:43.348 --> 19:45.283
Now the Rooney girls
are ready to get their

19:45.285 --> 19:47.985
¶ a-party on, a-party on

19:47.987 --> 19:50.054
<i>¶ whoop whoop, their party on ¶</i>

19:50.056 --> 19:52.957
- ¶ party on, whoop whoop...
- Maddie: <i>Ahem!</i>

19:52.959 --> 19:54.425
Mom, mom,

19:54.427 --> 19:57.028
we've forgiven you.
You can stop punishing us.

19:57.996 --> 20:00.865
Maddie, we even got you

20:00.867 --> 20:02.867
a number six Jersey,
'cause we figured

20:02.869 --> 20:04.735
you'd want to change
your number.

20:06.171 --> 20:09.407
Actually I've decided to stick
with the number five.

20:09.409 --> 20:12.343
That's the day
my best friend was born.

20:15.013 --> 20:16.447
So, Liv, come over here.

20:16.449 --> 20:18.216
Help me blow out
all these candles.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.384
Uh, okay, one sec. I want
to get a video of this.

20:20.386 --> 20:23.147
I think I left my phone in the garage
when I was grabbing decorations.

20:24.323 --> 20:27.391
Video? Then we've gotta
have the windmill going.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.293
Dad, turn it on.

20:37.836 --> 20:41.339
- Guys, I love it.
- We did a good thing today, boys.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.941
See what happens
when you listen to Parker?

20:43.943 --> 20:46.377
( Loud whirring )

20:48.880 --> 20:51.449
That thing kicks up
quite a breeze.

20:57.489 --> 21:01.025
- Karen: <i>Oh no, the cake!</i>
<i>- ( Splats )</i>

21:04.496 --> 21:06.397
We have to turn this thing off!

21:06.399 --> 21:08.933
Don't worry, birthday girl,

21:08.935 --> 21:10.501
your hero is here.

21:17.509 --> 21:19.510
<i>( Electricity crackles )</i>

21:23.448 --> 21:25.216
Hey, superhero,

21:25.218 --> 21:27.551
the plug's right here.

21:35.427 --> 21:37.561
Whoa.

21:41.233 --> 21:43.801
Oh, nice work on the cake, mom!

21:43.803 --> 21:45.369
( Mouths )

21:49.908 --> 21:51.409
Oh hey, Parker, check it out.

21:51.411 --> 21:54.145
Liv got us a present
for helping out with the party.

21:54.147 --> 21:55.913
It's nice to be appreciated.

21:59.284 --> 22:00.985
Surprise!

22:00.987 --> 22:02.586
( Shrieking )

22:04.589 --> 22:06.957
Dude, that was awesome.
Nice work, pretzel-butt.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.893
Up top!

22:08.895 --> 22:10.528
Yeah! Hey.

22:10.530 --> 22:13.998
Can you fit in my underwear drawer?
I want to freak out my mom.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.333
Follow me!
