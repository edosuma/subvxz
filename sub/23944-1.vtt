00:24.676 --> 00:26.809
Congratulations!

00:26.852 --> 00:29.681
Four weddings,
three anniversaries...

00:29.725 --> 00:32.206
Two vow renewals.

00:32.249 --> 00:33.468
I'm exhausted.

00:33.511 --> 00:34.295
Perfect.

00:34.338 --> 00:35.383
Come on.

00:37.994 --> 00:41.563
Olivia, can't I just sit and
enjoy a little peace and quiet?

00:43.086 --> 00:45.088
No.

00:45.132 --> 00:49.484
You are going to help me
clean up in the new kitchen.

00:53.357 --> 00:56.969
To a little Mick Turner.

01:36.531 --> 01:38.837
We have an open weekend.

01:38.881 --> 01:39.360
We do?

01:39.403 --> 01:40.448
Mmmhmm.

01:40.491 --> 01:41.840
And do you know
what weekend it is?

01:41.884 --> 01:42.711
No.

01:42.754 --> 01:44.060
It's Valentine's weekend.

01:44.104 --> 01:44.713
This weekend?

01:44.756 --> 01:45.801
Yeah.

01:45.844 --> 01:46.671
This weekend is
Valentine's weekend?

01:46.715 --> 01:47.455
Yes, it is.

01:47.498 --> 01:49.021
Oh no.

01:49.065 --> 01:52.068
With such an early spring
this year I totally forgot that.

01:52.112 --> 01:52.677
I didn't know it was...

01:53.809 --> 01:55.027
Valentine's weekend.

01:55.071 --> 01:56.333
Oh, it's beautiful.

01:56.377 --> 01:57.856
And I'm taking you
to dinner.

01:57.900 --> 01:58.596
You are?

01:58.640 --> 02:00.163
Yes, I am.

02:00.207 --> 02:02.513
Can we have a picnic
this weekend, too?

02:02.557 --> 02:06.082
Oh, oh, let's take the canoe out
on the lake and then,

02:06.126 --> 02:09.738
oh, you take me horseback riding
into the sunset, please?

02:09.781 --> 02:10.520
All this weekend?

02:10.565 --> 02:11.653
Yeah.

02:11.696 --> 02:12.915
I'm not gonna get to play golf,
am I?

02:12.958 --> 02:14.395
No, you're not.

02:16.919 --> 02:18.399
I'm not answering that.

02:18.442 --> 02:20.052
Oh, yes you are.

02:20.096 --> 02:21.663
It's Bonnie.

02:21.706 --> 02:22.794
Your sister.

02:24.144 --> 02:24.970
Bonnie!

02:25.014 --> 02:26.494
Wow, what a great surprise.

02:26.537 --> 02:27.973
Well, I have another one.

02:28.017 --> 02:30.585
I thought I'd come see you
this weekend.

02:30.628 --> 02:31.803
This weekend?

02:31.847 --> 02:33.675
We can be there by tonight
if not earlier.

02:33.718 --> 02:35.067
Tonight?

02:35.111 --> 02:36.199
Great.

02:36.243 --> 02:37.026
"We"?

02:37.069 --> 02:39.115
Oh, did... did I say "we"?

02:39.159 --> 02:40.377
We'll see you soon.

02:40.421 --> 02:41.596
Ok.

02:42.814 --> 02:43.946
She's on her way up here.

02:43.989 --> 02:45.513
And she's with someone.

02:45.556 --> 02:46.340
What?

02:46.383 --> 02:47.689
That's wonderful.

02:47.732 --> 02:49.256
So much for a weekend alone.

02:49.299 --> 02:51.649
Oh, Mick, family always
comes first.

02:51.693 --> 02:54.261
We can ride our horses
into the sunset any time.

02:54.304 --> 02:56.219
How long has it been
since you've seen her?

02:56.263 --> 02:58.352
A couple years, since
she moved to London.

02:58.395 --> 02:59.266
London?

02:59.309 --> 03:01.137
They're not up here yet.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.661
We still have some time alone.

03:03.705 --> 03:05.402
You've got that rehearsal
in a little bit, right?

03:05.446 --> 03:06.882
For the show on Sunday night?

03:06.925 --> 03:08.318
Yeah, yeah, rehearsal.

03:11.452 --> 03:14.237
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:14.281 --> 03:15.369
Mick, it's my mom.

03:15.412 --> 03:16.021
Hmm?

03:16.065 --> 03:17.414
She's FaceTiming.

03:17.458 --> 03:18.459
Hi, mom.

03:18.502 --> 03:19.938
Hi, sweetheart!

03:19.982 --> 03:21.679
Hi, it's mom and Johnny.

03:21.723 --> 03:22.506
Hi, Johnny.

03:22.550 --> 03:23.855
You're looking fantastic.

03:23.899 --> 03:25.205
What's going on
with your hair, sweetie?

03:25.248 --> 03:26.815
Just on the side there,
you're-

03:26.858 --> 03:29.600
Hey, Mick, is that standing
invitation to come to the inn,

03:29.644 --> 03:30.514
is that still standing?

03:30.558 --> 03:32.168
Uh... sure, always.

03:32.212 --> 03:32.908
Great.

03:32.951 --> 03:34.823
Oh, good.

03:34.866 --> 03:37.173
Nora and I, we're antiquing
in your neck of the woods

03:37.217 --> 03:40.089
so we were thinking of
dropping in for the weekend.

03:40.132 --> 03:42.483
Oh, hey, the more
the merrier.

03:42.526 --> 03:43.179
Great.

03:43.223 --> 03:43.875
Great.

03:43.919 --> 03:44.572
See ya, kids.

03:44.615 --> 03:45.137
By, darlings.

03:45.181 --> 03:46.095
Bye.

03:49.794 --> 03:51.143
Our weekend.

03:51.187 --> 03:52.580
At least nobody's
getting married.

03:52.623 --> 03:54.495
Hello, hello!

03:54.538 --> 03:55.626
Julie?

03:55.670 --> 03:57.411
Hey, wha- what're you
doing here?

03:57.454 --> 03:58.150
Hi, you guys.

03:58.194 --> 03:59.239
Good to see you.

03:59.282 --> 04:00.588
And Wyatt.

04:01.676 --> 04:03.330
Olivia, Mick... I-
I mean Mr. Turner.

04:03.373 --> 04:04.287
It's good to see you.

04:04.331 --> 04:05.636
So why aren't you
in school?

04:05.680 --> 04:07.116
What's wrong?

04:07.159 --> 04:09.727
Does something have to be
wrong for me to come home?

04:09.771 --> 04:11.816
No, we wanted to see
your performance.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.949
Since when do you drive
300 miles to hear me sing?

04:13.992 --> 04:15.559
Since now.

04:15.603 --> 04:17.779
Don't be an over-parenter.

04:17.822 --> 04:18.475
Is that a thing?

04:18.519 --> 04:20.260
Yeah, it is.

04:20.303 --> 04:21.391
The good news is
your aunt Bonnie

04:21.435 --> 04:22.610
is coming up this weekend.

04:22.653 --> 04:23.350
You're kidding.

04:23.393 --> 04:24.438
That's fantastic!

04:24.481 --> 04:25.352
I can't wait for her
to meet Wyatt.

04:25.395 --> 04:26.614
She's so cool.

04:26.657 --> 04:28.398
I stayed with her in London
two summers ago.

04:28.442 --> 04:29.791
Right, the one that put you
in the fashion show.

04:29.834 --> 04:30.357
Yeah.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.140
Fashion show?

04:31.183 --> 04:32.315
What fashion show?

04:32.359 --> 04:35.449
Her summer swimsuit line,
I... told you.

04:35.492 --> 04:36.537
Swimsuit line?

04:36.580 --> 04:37.842
You never said anything
about that.

04:37.886 --> 04:38.974
It wasn't a big deal.

04:39.017 --> 04:40.541
Let's go check out the lake.

04:42.064 --> 04:43.283
See ya, Mr. Turner.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.329
Over-parenting?

04:46.373 --> 04:49.854
Yes, just a little.

04:49.898 --> 04:51.073
You know what's weird?

04:51.116 --> 04:52.770
They're older than us
than when we met.

04:52.814 --> 04:55.077
Yeah, well now we know how
our parents must have felt.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.513
Well, I know how your mother
felt about me.

04:56.557 --> 04:58.254
Yeah, well she likes you now.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.212
Speaking of, I probably should
get to the grocery store

05:00.256 --> 05:01.779
to get food for our guests.

05:01.823 --> 05:03.390
We are gonna try to have
a Valentine's weekend

05:03.433 --> 05:04.695
together, right?

05:04.739 --> 05:06.393
Yes, we are.

05:06.436 --> 05:07.829
I'll see you after rehearsal.

05:31.592 --> 05:32.288
Hi!

05:32.332 --> 05:33.681
Oh, hey guys.

05:33.724 --> 05:35.160
How come we're practicing here?

05:35.204 --> 05:37.598
We're practicing in here
because you guys are gonna be

05:37.641 --> 05:39.339
on this stage with me
Sunday night

05:39.382 --> 05:42.167
singing at the Valentine's
benefit.

05:42.211 --> 05:43.734
We're singing
with your band?

05:43.778 --> 05:45.910
That's right, in front of
the whole town.

05:45.954 --> 05:46.563
Here's the new song.

05:46.607 --> 05:47.956
Here, pass it out.

05:47.999 --> 05:49.610
You guys come in
on the chorus,

05:49.653 --> 05:52.482
just a little something special
I wrote for Valentine's Day.

05:52.526 --> 05:54.136
For Olivia?

05:54.179 --> 05:56.834
Actually, yes it is for Olivia
but you guys can't tell anybody.

05:56.878 --> 05:58.183
It's a surprise, ok?

05:58.227 --> 05:58.880
Ok.

05:58.923 --> 05:59.446
You promise?

05:59.489 --> 06:00.795
Yeah.

06:00.838 --> 06:02.318
Alright, come on up here,
let's work on this.

06:07.976 --> 06:16.245
♪ Ahhhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh ♪

06:16.288 --> 06:17.725
You guys sound good today.

06:17.768 --> 06:18.421
Well done.

06:20.423 --> 06:22.294
Hey!

06:22.338 --> 06:23.208
Ok, that's it for today, guys.

06:23.252 --> 06:24.079
Good work.

06:24.122 --> 06:25.472
Thanks.

06:29.432 --> 06:30.346
That was awesome.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.913
Well, what a surprise.

06:33.784 --> 06:35.438
How long you been there?

06:35.482 --> 06:38.136
I heard it all and
she's gonna love it.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.268
"She"?

06:39.311 --> 06:40.400
Oh, come on.

06:40.443 --> 06:41.488
You didn't write that
for the ducks.

06:41.531 --> 06:42.793
It's for Valentine's Day
for Olivia,

06:42.837 --> 06:44.578
and it's a surprise
so don't say anything.

06:44.621 --> 06:46.362
Awe, that's so sweet.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.104
So you're here at my rehearsal,
you drive in from school

06:49.147 --> 06:51.193
for my performance Sunday,

06:51.236 --> 06:53.413
what's all the sudden interest
in my music?

06:53.456 --> 06:57.199
I just think people's passions
should be acknowledged.

06:57.242 --> 06:58.940
This doesn't have to do
with you and Wyatt, does it?

06:58.983 --> 07:00.332
No.

07:00.376 --> 07:01.203
You're not getting engaged
or anything, are you?

07:01.246 --> 07:03.118
No! No, that would be crazy.

07:03.161 --> 07:04.772
Good.

07:04.815 --> 07:07.078
So tell me, what's-
what's up?

07:16.348 --> 07:19.177
I'm quitting school.

07:19.221 --> 07:20.222
What?

07:20.265 --> 07:22.311
Look, it's just not for me,
Dad.

07:22.354 --> 07:23.834
Well, honey, you just started.

07:23.878 --> 07:26.010
I've been there
for almost two years

07:26.054 --> 07:31.799
and I've realized I wanna be
a chef.

07:31.842 --> 07:33.627
Julie, that's more of a hobby,
isn't it?

07:33.670 --> 07:35.019
Not anymore.

07:35.063 --> 07:36.499
I'm a sous chef at the dorm
and I'm really good.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.109
Well, ok, that's dorm food.

07:38.153 --> 07:41.722
No, Dad, I'm creating my own
recipes and they're using them.

07:41.765 --> 07:44.202
Honey, this is something you
can do after you get a degree.

07:44.246 --> 07:46.248
Look, I could get my feet wet
cooking at the inn,

07:46.291 --> 07:47.554
I know Duke could use the help,

07:47.597 --> 07:49.381
or, if you're totally
against that

07:49.425 --> 07:51.383
I've already applied at
restaurants in New York.

07:51.427 --> 07:55.431
And I've saved up my money
so all you have to do is just...

07:55.475 --> 07:56.824
wish me luck.

07:56.867 --> 07:58.826
Or Bon Apetit.

07:58.869 --> 08:00.480
I don't think it's a good idea.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.267
I know.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.617
And I'm sorry to disappoint you

08:07.661 --> 08:12.317
but I'm finishing the semester
and that's it.

08:12.361 --> 08:14.102
I'll pay you back
for the tuition.

08:14.145 --> 08:15.407
Julie!

08:15.451 --> 08:18.802
Look, I love you, Dad,
but my mind is made up.

08:26.157 --> 08:28.159
Hey, how was rehearsal?

08:28.203 --> 08:33.381
Well, Julie surprised me
by stopping by.

08:36.820 --> 08:39.256
She's dropping out of school.

08:39.301 --> 08:40.345
What?

08:40.389 --> 08:42.347
That's what I said.

08:42.390 --> 08:44.872
She said she wants to be
a chef.

08:47.962 --> 08:49.137
Oh.

08:49.180 --> 08:51.313
Well, she's... she's
a pretty good cook.

08:51.356 --> 08:52.270
She's 20.

08:52.314 --> 08:54.577
Who knows what they want
at 20?

08:54.621 --> 08:56.274
You did.

08:56.318 --> 08:59.451
This isn't about me.

08:59.495 --> 09:01.541
Are you sure?

09:09.113 --> 09:10.071
Hey!

09:12.116 --> 09:13.030
Hey.

09:13.074 --> 09:13.901
Hi, guys.

09:13.944 --> 09:14.597
There is the happy couple.

09:14.641 --> 09:15.990
Hey.

09:16.033 --> 09:17.644
Hi, mom.

09:17.687 --> 09:18.993
Oh, it is so good to see you.

09:19.036 --> 09:20.081
How was the drive?

09:20.124 --> 09:20.777
It was great.

09:20.821 --> 09:21.430
Good, good.

09:21.473 --> 09:22.431
You got here fast.

09:22.474 --> 09:23.650
Well, that's a surprise

09:23.693 --> 09:25.477
because someone
wouldn't take directions.

09:25.521 --> 09:27.001
And yet I managed
to get us here.

09:27.044 --> 09:28.568
You did.

09:28.611 --> 09:30.352
Come on, we'll get you
all settled in.

09:30.395 --> 09:33.877
Oh yes.

09:33.921 --> 09:36.097
Johnny, Nora, you remember
my daughter, Julie?

09:36.140 --> 09:37.272
Of course we do.

09:37.315 --> 09:38.186
Yes.

09:38.229 --> 09:38.969
Nice to see you again, sweetie.

09:39.013 --> 09:40.101
You too.

09:40.144 --> 09:41.276
Welcome back.

09:41.319 --> 09:42.538
Thank you.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.714
Actually, I thought
I'd cook for everyone.

09:44.758 --> 09:47.543
So I'll start on tonight's menu
with Duke.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.153
That is a great idea.

09:49.197 --> 09:50.111
Thanks hon.

09:52.113 --> 09:53.375
You look terrific, Olivia.

09:53.418 --> 09:54.768
Oh, thank you.

09:54.811 --> 09:55.682
Doesn't she, Nora?

09:55.725 --> 09:57.248
Yes, she always does.

09:57.292 --> 09:58.598
I'm just not sure about
that lipstick, sweetie.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.208
Mom.

10:00.251 --> 10:01.601
The place looks great.

10:01.644 --> 10:02.340
Oh, thanks.

10:02.384 --> 10:03.777
It's all Olivia, not me.

10:03.820 --> 10:05.126
Although I did buy that
trash can by the front desk.

10:06.257 --> 10:07.563
Well, business
is going well then?

10:07.607 --> 10:08.346
It is.

10:08.390 --> 10:09.304
Anyone like a drink?

10:09.347 --> 10:10.348
Yes, I would.

10:10.392 --> 10:11.219
Rosé please.

10:11.262 --> 10:12.307
I'll give you a hand.

10:12.350 --> 10:13.351
Mom, I wanna show you
the garden.

10:13.395 --> 10:14.875
I planted a couple
of flowers...

10:14.918 --> 10:16.093
I love cooking
in this kitchen.

10:16.137 --> 10:18.748
Yeah, this renovation
was long overdue.

10:20.141 --> 10:23.884
Well, it sounds lik
you've made up your mind.

10:23.927 --> 10:25.146
I have.

10:25.189 --> 10:26.843
Are you sure that you wanna
leave school?

10:26.887 --> 10:28.497
It's not gonna go over well
with your dad.

10:28.540 --> 10:30.368
Duke, it's my passion.

10:30.412 --> 10:32.849
I love cooking and everything
about it.

10:32.893 --> 10:34.155
The creativity.

10:34.198 --> 10:36.679
The magic of making something
that's bigger

10:36.723 --> 10:38.202
than the sum of its parts,

10:38.246 --> 10:41.815
and the professionalism
of getting it just perfect.

10:41.858 --> 10:43.468
I mean, you get that,
don't you?

10:43.512 --> 10:44.905
Absolutely.

10:44.948 --> 10:47.516
But a big part of running
this kitchen

10:47.559 --> 10:49.910
is working with your dad
on a daily basis.

10:49.953 --> 10:53.696
I thought about that and I was
kinda counting on your help.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.308
I kinda thought so.

10:57.352 --> 11:00.921
Ok, let's talk sauces and then
the kitchen is yours.

11:00.964 --> 11:03.924
And I will go and figure out
how to try and convince your dad

11:03.967 --> 11:05.447
while also keeping my job.

11:05.490 --> 11:06.709
Come on.

11:06.753 --> 11:07.754
Ok.

11:07.797 --> 11:08.929
Grab a spoon from there,
would ya?

11:11.148 --> 11:12.715
Ok, so that's where I planted
all the roses.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.499
They haven't quite
grown in yet.

11:14.543 --> 11:17.851
So, things are still growing
strong with you and Nora?

11:17.894 --> 11:20.723
I owe it to two words:
"yes, dear".

11:20.767 --> 11:21.811
And that works?

11:21.855 --> 11:22.986
About half the time.

11:23.030 --> 11:24.727
What about the other half?

11:24.771 --> 11:26.207
We go antiquing.

11:27.904 --> 11:29.166
Got it.

11:31.908 --> 11:34.563
Is this a good time to talk
about the elephant in the room?

11:34.606 --> 11:35.520
Elephant?

11:35.564 --> 11:37.261
I just don't understand
you two.

11:37.305 --> 11:39.176
Why you would wanna be
business partners

11:39.220 --> 11:41.004
instead of having
a real relationship.

11:41.048 --> 11:42.789
We have a real relationship.

11:42.832 --> 11:44.268
But no commitment.

11:44.312 --> 11:46.009
Ok, mom, you've been here
three minutes.

11:47.358 --> 11:48.751
Can you save the critique
of my entire life

11:48.795 --> 11:50.057
until after dinner, please?

11:50.100 --> 11:51.014
Alright, ok.

11:51.058 --> 11:52.189
I just worry about you,
sweetie.

11:52.233 --> 11:53.887
Thank you, but
you don't have to.

11:56.498 --> 11:57.542
Oh.

12:02.286 --> 12:03.287
We can get through this.

12:03.331 --> 12:04.288
Can we?

12:04.332 --> 12:06.682
It's family, remember?

12:06.726 --> 12:08.205
Right.

12:09.816 --> 12:10.686
Ok, now, listen to me.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.122
I will definitely be there, ok?

12:12.166 --> 12:13.558
We are catching a flight out
of here Sunday afternoon

12:13.602 --> 12:15.299
as soon as we wrap this up.

12:15.343 --> 12:17.519
So I'm gonna send some samples
to the buyer later today.

12:17.562 --> 12:18.128
That's great.

12:18.172 --> 12:19.434
Just one second.

12:19.477 --> 12:21.305
Yeah, make sure to cc me
on those samples, ok?

12:21.349 --> 12:23.438
I need to approve those.

12:23.481 --> 12:24.700
My assistant sometimes forgets.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.093
You know, we had the problem
last time, ok?

12:26.136 --> 12:27.703
I don't want to repeat it.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.923
Now, I saw the first batch
and I was not happy.

12:29.966 --> 12:30.662
Oh, really?

12:30.706 --> 12:31.707
Huh?

12:31.751 --> 12:32.969
Yeah, I'll be right there,
ok hun?

12:33.013 --> 12:33.796
You still there, Sean?

12:33.840 --> 12:35.493
Yeah, no- I am still here,

12:35.537 --> 12:37.539
the question is
are you still there?

12:37.582 --> 12:38.627
Do you think that
colour needs...

12:38.670 --> 12:40.281
No plaid, ok?

12:40.847 --> 12:42.022
I'm here!

12:42.065 --> 12:43.501
Ah, there she is.

12:43.545 --> 12:45.155
My sister, the fashionista.

12:45.199 --> 12:47.157
My brother, the inn-keeper.

12:47.201 --> 12:48.463
Look at us.

12:50.204 --> 12:50.813
Olivia.

12:50.857 --> 12:51.553
Hi.

12:51.596 --> 12:52.293
You look amazing.

12:52.336 --> 12:53.294
Oh my gosh, you do, too.

12:53.337 --> 12:54.295
It's so good to see you.

12:54.338 --> 12:55.296
It's been forever.

12:55.339 --> 12:56.906
It's been so long.

12:56.950 --> 12:59.735
Do you remember the first time
my brother brought you home?

12:59.779 --> 13:01.868
I knew instantly that you were
way too good for him.

13:02.694 --> 13:03.739
I think you were eight.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.045
I was right, wasn't I?

13:05.088 --> 13:07.482
Yeah, you were.

13:07.525 --> 13:08.483
It's so good to see you.

13:08.526 --> 13:09.876
It's so good to see you.

13:09.919 --> 13:11.573
You know, I know that
we have been so caught up

13:11.616 --> 13:12.835
in our own lives,

13:12.879 --> 13:14.489
but just because there's
an ocean between us

13:14.532 --> 13:16.621
doesn't mean that we can't
be there for each other, right?

13:16.665 --> 13:17.709
I feel the same way.

13:17.753 --> 13:18.928
I'm so glad to hear
that because...

13:18.972 --> 13:23.019
I have an announcement
to make.

13:23.063 --> 13:24.716
I'm getting married.

13:24.760 --> 13:25.543
What?

13:27.328 --> 13:29.852
Bonnie! Congratulations!

13:29.896 --> 13:31.158
Oh, Bonnie, that is wonderful.

13:31.201 --> 13:31.811
Yeah.

13:31.854 --> 13:32.550
Wow.

13:32.594 --> 13:33.377
That's great.

13:33.421 --> 13:35.118
So when's the big day?

13:35.162 --> 13:36.598
Oh, we were thinking Sunday.

13:36.641 --> 13:38.513
You know, just us,
just- just family.

13:38.556 --> 13:39.731
Maybe a few guests.

13:39.775 --> 13:41.211
This Sunday?

13:41.255 --> 13:43.605
I know, it's really last-minute
but we were in New York

13:43.648 --> 13:46.129
and both of us just thought
why not just go for it?

13:46.173 --> 13:49.089
Just my brother and Olivia,
here, on Valentine's Day.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.873
I mean really, what could be
more perfect?

13:50.917 --> 13:51.743
Nothing.

13:51.787 --> 13:52.570
We'll handle everything, ok?

13:52.614 --> 13:54.007
Absolutely.

13:54.050 --> 13:54.921
Thank you.

13:54.964 --> 13:56.879
Bonnie, I am so happy for you.

13:56.923 --> 13:57.488
Thank you.

13:58.446 --> 13:58.925
So, uh, what about the groom?

13:58.968 --> 13:59.751
Where is he?

13:59.795 --> 14:01.231
When do we meet this guy?

14:01.275 --> 14:02.232
Well, he is just finishing up
a call but you know what

14:02.276 --> 14:03.451
is so funny?

14:03.494 --> 14:06.106
It turns out that you two
know each other.

14:06.149 --> 14:06.758
Really?

14:06.802 --> 14:07.803
Yeah.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.500
Mick, you remember Sean?

14:12.764 --> 14:13.635
That guy?

14:13.678 --> 14:14.941
This is the guy you're marrying?

14:17.987 --> 14:19.119
Come on.

14:19.162 --> 14:20.381
I know- I know you two have
a history-

14:20.424 --> 14:22.992
Look, it's been a long time.

14:23.036 --> 14:25.038
Suddenly it just feels
like yesterday.

14:28.084 --> 14:31.174
Olivia, this is my fiancé,
Sean.

14:31.218 --> 14:32.610
Nice to meet you, Olivia.

14:32.654 --> 14:34.699
It's a pleasure to meet you.

14:39.530 --> 14:42.838
I love my sister, but how can
she marry that guy?

14:42.882 --> 14:44.579
Uh, who is he?

14:44.622 --> 14:46.233
He was a keyboard player
in my band.

14:46.276 --> 14:48.191
A young hot shot guy
that we let in.

14:48.235 --> 14:51.499
We were out on the road on a
tour playing second billing,

14:51.542 --> 14:53.631
waiting for something bigger
to happen and it finally does.

14:53.675 --> 14:56.765
I booked a huge venue
and on the day of the show

14:56.808 --> 14:57.679
this guy bailed.

14:57.722 --> 14:58.723
He left.

14:58.767 --> 14:59.289
Never said a word
to any of us.

14:59.333 --> 14:59.986
Just took off.

15:00.029 --> 15:01.422
I had to cancel the gig.

15:01.465 --> 15:02.684
Me and the rest of the guys
had to use our savings

15:02.727 --> 15:03.990
to try to keep the tour afloat

15:04.033 --> 15:05.817
and it eventually
just all fell apart.

15:05.861 --> 15:07.167
Awful.

15:07.210 --> 15:08.124
When was this?

15:08.168 --> 15:10.431
It was just a few years ago.

15:10.474 --> 15:11.823
Maybe 20 years ago.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.869
But the point is a cheetah
never loses its spots.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.175
I think it's a leopard.

15:15.218 --> 15:16.524
Leopard, cheetah.

15:16.567 --> 15:19.483
The guy's out for himself,
he always has been.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.311
Mick, what if he made
a mistake, right?

15:21.355 --> 15:22.791
People make mistakes.

15:22.834 --> 15:23.618
We did.

15:23.661 --> 15:24.662
No, Olivia.

15:24.706 --> 15:25.968
Leaving a band
is not a mistake.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.404
It's a choice.

15:27.448 --> 15:28.971
Ok, well, like it or not
he is marrying your sister.

15:29.015 --> 15:29.972
Yes.

15:30.016 --> 15:30.625
My sister.

15:30.668 --> 15:31.887
My baby sister.

15:31.931 --> 15:32.757
My only sister.

15:32.801 --> 15:34.020
I have to look out for her.

15:34.063 --> 15:35.673
If you ruin it you may never
see her again.

15:35.717 --> 15:37.980
Well, so I'm just supposed
to sit back and let this happen?

15:38.024 --> 15:38.807
Yes.

15:38.850 --> 15:40.635
That's what you do.

15:42.463 --> 15:45.814
Could you please just look
a little happier?

15:49.426 --> 15:50.906
That's your fake smile.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.038
No, it's not.

15:52.081 --> 15:53.517
This is my fake smile.

15:53.561 --> 15:55.302
Either one will do.

16:03.484 --> 16:05.529
Alright kids, the kitchen
is yours.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.096
Don't worry, we'll take
good care of it.

16:07.140 --> 16:08.402
If I cook the entire weekend

16:08.445 --> 16:10.882
my dad will have have
to see how serious I am.

16:10.926 --> 16:15.017
So your plan is to feed him
into changing his mind?

16:15.061 --> 16:15.844
Exactly.

16:15.887 --> 16:16.888
Uh-huh.

16:16.932 --> 16:19.500
I will see you guys tomorrow.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.939
What's wrong?

16:23.983 --> 16:25.941
Nothing.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.116
Wyatt.

16:29.205 --> 16:32.469
So... it's decided, then?

16:32.513 --> 16:35.690
You're 100 percent
leaving school?

16:35.733 --> 16:36.517
Yeah.

16:36.560 --> 16:38.432
You knew that.

16:38.475 --> 16:43.654
Yeah, I... I just didn't realize
it was official.

16:43.698 --> 16:47.049
I thought you were ok
with it.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.138
Yeah, I am.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.711
So we're playing at this
little dive bar in Philly,

16:56.754 --> 16:59.018
I think they paid us
in chips and beer,

16:59.061 --> 17:01.368
Mick goes to do one of his
famous guitar slides,

17:01.411 --> 17:03.413
slips on the sawdust
and BOOM!

17:03.457 --> 17:05.111
Falls flat on his back.

17:05.154 --> 17:07.635
But, like the pro that he is,
he finished the guitar solo.

17:07.678 --> 17:09.115
Oh my.

17:09.157 --> 17:10.637
Well, I take it by the size
of Bonnie's ring

17:10.681 --> 17:12.988
that you're not playing
for chips and beer anymore.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.250
Uh, no.

17:14.294 --> 17:16.644
No, I'm in the clothing business
now like Bonnie.

17:16.686 --> 17:19.603
Well, except I have one store
and Sean has a chain of stores

17:19.646 --> 17:20.909
across the UK.

17:20.952 --> 17:22.563
It's really just a few shops.

17:22.606 --> 17:24.826
A few shops where
royalty shop.

17:24.868 --> 17:26.088
Royalty?

17:26.132 --> 17:27.959
Seriously?

17:28.002 --> 17:29.396
Yeah.

17:29.439 --> 17:31.789
Getting him away for the weekend
is a minor miracle.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.704
The only reason why we were able
to be here

17:33.748 --> 17:35.793
was because he had a meeting
with a buyer in New York.

17:35.837 --> 17:36.925
Oh.

17:36.968 --> 17:39.275
Well, we are really glad
you are here.

17:39.319 --> 17:41.799
So you're staying for Dad's
performance, right?

17:41.843 --> 17:42.931
What?

17:42.974 --> 17:45.020
Mick, you're singing?

17:45.064 --> 17:46.413
You didn't mention that.

17:46.456 --> 17:47.588
Sunday night.

17:47.631 --> 17:48.763
It's just a local
Valentine's benefit.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.330
It's a really big deal
around here.

17:50.373 --> 17:53.159
They raise tons of money for
the local food bank every year.

17:53.202 --> 17:55.117
Oh, we would love to go.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.511
Sean, can we book
a later flight?

17:57.554 --> 17:58.816
Oh, sorry sweetie,

17:58.860 --> 18:00.383
we have to head out right
after the wedding.

18:00.427 --> 18:02.951
We gotta get that
new buyer started.

18:02.994 --> 18:03.865
Next time.

18:03.908 --> 18:05.084
Yeah.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.563
Next time.

18:06.607 --> 18:10.045
Speaking of the wedding,
what'd you guys have in mind?

18:11.873 --> 18:12.569
Nothing, really.

18:12.613 --> 18:13.962
I mean, in particular.

18:14.005 --> 18:15.572
Yeah, we don't wanna make
a big thing out of it.

18:15.616 --> 18:18.749
Yeah, Sean's not really a big
wedding type of person.

18:18.793 --> 18:19.794
No.

18:19.837 --> 18:21.665
Well, you are.

18:21.709 --> 18:23.580
Not anymore.

18:23.624 --> 18:25.278
Bonnie, you talked about
your wedding all the time

18:25.321 --> 18:26.714
when we were growing up.

18:26.757 --> 18:28.455
Mick, I did not.

18:28.498 --> 18:30.370
I mean, not all the time.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.592
Oh, Julie, this is so delicious.

18:35.636 --> 18:37.116
Thank you.

18:37.159 --> 18:39.683
Duke gave me some pointers
and Wyatt was my sous chef.

18:39.727 --> 18:41.511
That's French for
"he who chopped onions".

18:46.255 --> 18:49.171
Oh, uh... this, uh,
this'll just take a sec.

18:49.215 --> 18:50.564
Sorry, guys.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.264
It's his busy season.

18:55.308 --> 18:57.179
So how did you two meet,
anyway?

18:57.223 --> 19:00.574
Ugh, at the most boring place
on earth,

19:00.617 --> 19:02.053
an apparel convention.

19:02.097 --> 19:04.055
Well, it doesn't matter
how things start,

19:04.099 --> 19:05.753
it's where they end up.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.058
Exactly.

19:07.102 --> 19:09.887
And honestly, this past
eight months have been

19:09.931 --> 19:11.367
the most wonderful
of my lifetime.

19:11.411 --> 19:12.629
Eight months?

19:12.673 --> 19:15.241
You've only known him
for eight months?

19:15.284 --> 19:17.199
Yeah.

19:17.243 --> 19:19.375
But you know what?
We love each other.

19:19.419 --> 19:20.942
And we have this rule.

19:20.985 --> 19:24.337
We share everything,
no matter what.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.034
We're always honest
with each other.

19:26.077 --> 19:27.688
We are, too.

19:27.731 --> 19:29.559
And besides, there's
no one right path,

19:29.603 --> 19:30.908
I mean, look at you two.

19:30.952 --> 19:33.084
You ended things, you even
married other people

19:33.128 --> 19:34.564
and now look at you.

19:34.608 --> 19:37.306
All these years later it's like
you were never apart.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.272
Julie, this is wonderful.

19:46.315 --> 19:47.534
It is just exquisite, darling.

19:47.577 --> 19:49.275
Thank you so much.

19:49.318 --> 19:50.058
Thank you guys.

19:50.101 --> 19:50.885
You too, Wyatt.

19:50.928 --> 19:52.234
The onions, oh.

19:52.278 --> 19:53.714
Yeah, the onions.

19:53.757 --> 19:55.063
Can't forget the onions.

19:55.106 --> 19:56.717
Perfection.

20:04.333 --> 20:05.378
That went well.

20:05.421 --> 20:07.467
Who gets married
after eight months?

20:07.510 --> 20:10.818
Didn't your parents get married
after three months?

20:10.861 --> 20:12.602
You remember way too much.

20:12.646 --> 20:15.649
Well, I got that
from my mother.

20:15.692 --> 20:17.825
Does this feel like
a long day to you?

20:17.868 --> 20:18.782
Yeah, it does.

20:19.914 --> 20:21.437
Mick and Olivia,
we have a surprise.

20:21.481 --> 20:26.094
Sean picked this out, it's
a little Valentine's Day gift

20:26.137 --> 20:27.748
to you from us.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.619
That is so nice.

20:29.663 --> 20:30.446
You shouldn't have.

20:30.490 --> 20:31.273
Yes, we should have.

20:31.317 --> 20:32.840
Open it.

20:32.883 --> 20:34.494
The best way to forget about
the past is with a present.

20:34.537 --> 20:36.060
Yeah.

20:36.104 --> 20:37.192
You know, when I found out
that you were Bonnie's brother

20:37.236 --> 20:38.846
I told her I wasn't sure
how you'd react.

20:38.889 --> 20:41.892
And I told him that everything
would be fine.

20:41.936 --> 20:43.590
That you probably
wouldn't even remember.

20:43.633 --> 20:45.635
It was so long ago.

20:45.679 --> 20:47.420
Open it.

20:50.336 --> 20:51.162
These are amazing.

20:51.206 --> 20:52.686
Every music lover needs one.

20:52.729 --> 20:55.906
Her name is Penelope and
she has access to every song

20:55.950 --> 20:57.691
and every artist you
could ever think of.

20:57.734 --> 20:58.735
She's brilliant.

20:58.779 --> 20:59.345
Wow.

20:59.388 --> 21:00.171
We've got two.

21:00.215 --> 21:01.085
Well, thank you.

21:01.129 --> 21:01.782
That's very thoughtful of you.

21:01.825 --> 21:02.609
Hey, check it out.

21:02.652 --> 21:04.741
Look, uh, this is so cool.

21:04.785 --> 21:08.441
Penelope, play a song
by Mick Turner.

21:08.484 --> 21:11.270
I'm sorry, I don't know
that name.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.753
Um...

21:16.797 --> 21:17.493
That's odd.

21:17.537 --> 21:19.365
Sorry, I've never...

21:19.408 --> 21:21.758
Well, that's ok, Penelope.
You're not alone.

21:21.802 --> 21:23.804
I don't really listen
to my own music anymore.

21:23.847 --> 21:25.762
Yeah, almost never.

21:27.808 --> 21:31.202
So listen, I don't know if this
is asking too much, Olivia,

21:31.246 --> 21:35.206
but I wanted you and Julie
to be my bridesmaids.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.469
I would be honoured.

21:36.512 --> 21:38.471
Thank you.

21:38.514 --> 21:42.344
And Mick, I'm hoping
that you will...

21:42.388 --> 21:44.738
that you'll give me away.

21:44.781 --> 21:46.261
Of course I will.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.307
Thank you.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.570
Mick, Olivia, thank you so much
for welcoming Sean

21:50.613 --> 21:52.049
into our family.

21:52.093 --> 21:55.488
And may we all be together
like this for a lifetime.

22:09.153 --> 22:10.633
We're so lucky.

22:10.677 --> 22:12.331
We have so much
in front of us.

22:27.084 --> 22:29.478
We're lucky all that stuff's
behind us, right?

22:43.405 --> 22:45.625
Could this get any better?

22:57.550 --> 22:59.465
Could this get any worse?

23:07.168 --> 23:08.822
Oh my gosh!

23:09.997 --> 23:11.607
Oh, wow.

23:11.651 --> 23:12.434
That's crazy!

23:12.478 --> 23:13.479
I wasn't expecting-

23:13.522 --> 23:14.436
No, I was not.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.220
A downpour.

23:16.264 --> 23:17.613
Oh.

23:17.657 --> 23:18.440
Oh, this place has the best
baked goods in town.

23:18.484 --> 23:19.485
You have to try one.

23:19.528 --> 23:20.181
Uh, yes.

23:20.224 --> 23:20.964
Let's do that.

23:21.008 --> 23:22.009
Ok.

23:24.011 --> 23:26.317
I feel like everything is coming
at me all at once.

23:26.361 --> 23:29.320
Oh, I know.

23:29.364 --> 23:30.713
I'm just under
so much pressure

23:30.757 --> 23:32.802
and I'm exhausted from trying
to convince my dad

23:32.846 --> 23:35.414
to let me leave school
so I can cook.

23:35.457 --> 23:36.719
Oh, sweetie.

23:36.763 --> 23:38.025
And I worry that he's
just letting me help out

23:38.068 --> 23:39.418
with your wedding this weekend

23:39.461 --> 23:41.376
and then he's just gonna send me
back to school.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.421
Well, he can't.

23:42.464 --> 23:43.596
He can't make you.

23:43.639 --> 23:46.163
Yeah.

23:46.207 --> 23:50.341
But he also doesn't have to let
me cook at the inn.

23:50.385 --> 23:52.605
Maybe I should just give in
and go back to school.

23:52.648 --> 23:54.433
I won't be there that long.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.349
Thank you.

23:58.393 --> 23:59.525
Thanks.

24:02.266 --> 24:04.834
You know, you and I have
something in common.

24:04.878 --> 24:06.314
What's that?

24:06.357 --> 24:08.708
We have both had to deal with
Mick Turner as our dad.

24:08.751 --> 24:10.274
Seriously?

24:10.318 --> 24:12.494
When we first lost our father
and Mick had to take over

24:12.538 --> 24:14.714
he tried to lay down
some strict rules.

24:14.757 --> 24:16.193
I mean really, really strict.

24:16.237 --> 24:18.935
He did not even want me going
to a movie with a boy,

24:18.979 --> 24:20.371
let alone staying out late.

24:20.415 --> 24:21.677
And I don't even wanna think
what he would have done

24:21.721 --> 24:23.549
had I kissed one of
those boys.

24:23.592 --> 24:25.420
Oh my goodness.

24:25.464 --> 24:26.987
What did you do?

24:27.030 --> 24:30.338
Well, at first I did what
anybody would do, I rebelled.

24:30.381 --> 24:31.252
And it was terrible.

24:31.295 --> 24:32.645
We fought so much.

24:32.688 --> 24:34.298
Honestly, it felt like it was
happening every day.

24:34.342 --> 24:38.172
I was so upset that I spent most
of my time in my room crying.

24:38.215 --> 24:41.784
So what happened?

24:41.828 --> 24:44.308
It was funny, it's just
the most simple thing,

24:44.352 --> 24:46.963
but your dad and I were arguing
again one day

24:47.007 --> 24:49.792
and I looked at him and I could
tell that he was really upset.

24:49.836 --> 24:53.056
He was even tearing up a bit and
for some reason in that moment

24:53.100 --> 24:55.276
I stopped seeing him as somebody
that was trying

24:55.319 --> 24:58.845
to fill my dad's shoes and I
started seeing him as someone

24:58.888 --> 25:01.630
that was just as scared
and just as nervous

25:01.674 --> 25:04.503
as I was about the future.

25:04.546 --> 25:05.808
Wow.

25:05.852 --> 25:06.679
I mean, I'm not saying
that things were perfect

25:06.722 --> 25:08.550
but after that they got better.

25:08.594 --> 25:10.160
A lot better.

25:10.204 --> 25:12.728
Julie, do you think you could
start to see your dad

25:12.772 --> 25:16.123
as someone that has his own
reasons for reacting

25:16.166 --> 25:18.299
the way he does to things?

25:18.342 --> 25:19.909
I do know that he's
always regretted

25:19.953 --> 25:23.478
that he just went off on tour
and never finished college.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.653
And do you think maybe
he's worried

25:24.697 --> 25:26.481
that you're making
the same mistake?

25:26.525 --> 25:27.482
But that's the thing.

25:27.526 --> 25:28.875
I'm not.

25:28.918 --> 25:32.095
So I think what you need
to do is convince your dad,

25:32.139 --> 25:34.358
show him that there
is nothing to fear.

25:34.402 --> 25:36.273
That this is a good thing.

25:36.317 --> 25:37.274
Yeah.

25:37.318 --> 25:38.406
Ok.

25:38.449 --> 25:39.712
So how do I do that?

25:39.755 --> 25:41.104
Cook your way into his heart.

25:41.148 --> 25:43.672
I know that sounds corny
but if you do,

25:43.716 --> 25:46.719
eventually I think he'll start
to see his daughter the chef.

25:46.762 --> 25:49.112
And once that happens,
you know your dad.

25:49.156 --> 25:51.593
He's gonna support you
no matter what.

25:51.637 --> 25:54.988
You need to show your dad
that you're a grown up.

25:55.031 --> 25:58.295
So eat your treat, 'cause we
have wedding stuff to get done.

25:58.339 --> 26:00.341
Ok, ok.

26:00.384 --> 26:01.995
Look, this wasn't my idea.

26:02.038 --> 26:03.474
Julie came to me.

26:03.518 --> 26:05.955
Right now you're border-lining
on aiding and abetting.

26:05.999 --> 26:07.435
Oh, she's using the kitchen.

26:07.478 --> 26:09.132
She's not exactly robbing banks.

26:09.176 --> 26:12.266
You're not exactly supporting
my side of the argument here.

26:12.309 --> 26:13.484
Oh, I'm sorry boss.

26:13.528 --> 26:15.138
I should have checked
with you first.

26:15.182 --> 26:16.313
Is that what you want
to hear?

26:16.357 --> 26:18.446
Oh, come on, this
is about exploring.

26:18.489 --> 26:19.316
About experimenting.

26:19.360 --> 26:20.666
She is experimenting.

26:20.709 --> 26:21.580
In the kitchen.

26:21.623 --> 26:22.798
You know what I'm talking about.

26:22.842 --> 26:24.670
College is about
trying new things,

26:24.713 --> 26:26.193
not about changing
your career

26:26.236 --> 26:29.588
because of some one semester
cooking dorm gig.

26:29.631 --> 26:33.635
Well, I seem to recall you being
very set on your music career

26:33.679 --> 26:34.549
when you were in high school.

26:34.593 --> 26:35.376
Yeah, but that's me, ok?

26:35.419 --> 26:36.638
This is about my daughter.

26:36.682 --> 26:37.900
I want something different
for her.

26:37.944 --> 26:39.641
I want her to have more options
than I had.

26:39.685 --> 26:40.903
I'll pose it to you this way.

26:40.947 --> 26:42.731
If she was your daughter
would you want her

26:42.775 --> 26:45.125
to finish college?

26:45.168 --> 26:47.997
Truthfully, I would.

26:48.041 --> 26:49.477
But she's an adult.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.653
The final decision
belongs to her.

26:54.569 --> 26:57.572
Suggestion?

26:57.616 --> 26:59.095
What?

26:59.139 --> 27:04.013
Maybe instead of fighting her
on this you encourage her.

27:04.057 --> 27:06.625
I'm gonna go help Julie
set up the kitchen.

27:06.668 --> 27:07.582
Ok?

27:07.626 --> 27:08.757
Yeah.

27:23.076 --> 27:25.992
Oh, it's beautiful.

27:26.035 --> 27:27.428
Did you design it?

27:27.471 --> 27:30.300
No, I bought it off the rack
before we hit the road.

27:30.344 --> 27:31.693
Seriously?

27:31.737 --> 27:33.782
Last minute wedding,
last minute dress.

27:33.826 --> 27:35.566
Tell me you at least
tried it on.

27:35.610 --> 27:37.568
I did. Twice.

27:47.013 --> 27:48.014
You know what?

27:48.057 --> 27:49.537
You should try it on.

27:49.580 --> 27:51.234
What? No.

27:51.278 --> 27:52.235
No. I couldn't.

27:52.279 --> 27:53.628
Oh, yes, you could.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.499
And besides, I actually need
someone to try it on

27:55.543 --> 27:58.067
'cause I wanna do
some alterations.

27:58.111 --> 27:59.895
Oh, come on.

27:59.939 --> 28:02.724
Ok.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.726
This bag always drives
me bananas.

28:04.770 --> 28:05.858
There we go.

28:05.901 --> 28:07.468
Can I ask you a question?

28:07.511 --> 28:08.556
Of course.

28:08.599 --> 28:09.426
I'm the cool aunt.

28:09.470 --> 28:11.602
You can ask me anything.

28:11.646 --> 28:14.910
You used to talk about
your dream wedding.

28:14.954 --> 28:17.870
The dress and the flowers...

28:17.913 --> 28:20.568
You're wondering why
I'm doing it on the fly?

28:20.611 --> 28:21.830
Yeah.

28:21.874 --> 28:24.311
I think my- my definition of
"dream wedding"

28:24.354 --> 28:27.749
has changed over time.

28:27.793 --> 28:28.881
I think dreams do that,
you know?

28:28.924 --> 28:30.230
They mature as you do.

28:30.273 --> 28:32.623
Gosh, when I was your age
I had a check list.

28:32.667 --> 28:33.668
What was on it?

28:33.712 --> 28:35.191
Oh, you name it.

28:35.235 --> 28:37.759
Big church, wedding dress
designed by moi

28:37.803 --> 28:40.675
with a ten foot train and
matching bridesmaids and,

28:40.719 --> 28:42.808
I don't know, I was really
into the whole fairy tale,

28:42.851 --> 28:48.074
but... a couple years passed and
I think I just- I don't know.

28:48.117 --> 28:50.076
I realized that all you really
need for a perfect wedding

28:50.119 --> 28:52.339
is the right person.

28:52.382 --> 28:54.210
And I have that.

28:55.821 --> 28:56.996
Turn-down service.

28:57.039 --> 28:58.519
Oh, my other bridesmaid,
come in, come in.

28:58.562 --> 28:59.825
Hello.

28:59.868 --> 29:01.783
Please don't tell me you brought
pillow mints.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.045
Yes, I did.

29:03.089 --> 29:04.612
I mean, we are a classy
establishment here.

29:04.655 --> 29:05.700
Thank you.

29:06.788 --> 29:09.008
Oh, my goodness,
you look gorgeous.

29:09.051 --> 29:10.052
She's helping me out.

29:10.096 --> 29:11.140
I asked her to try it on.

29:11.184 --> 29:12.663
Ok.

29:12.707 --> 29:14.404
Oh, honey, you do look
beautiful.

29:14.448 --> 29:17.190
Too bad you are way too young
to get married.

29:17.233 --> 29:18.844
You know, I hate to say this,

29:18.887 --> 29:20.889
but you look better
in this dress than I do.

29:20.933 --> 29:21.672
No.

29:21.716 --> 29:22.456
I doubt that.

29:22.499 --> 29:23.936
No, she really does.

29:23.979 --> 29:26.199
I just- I love this dress.

29:26.242 --> 29:27.504
Ok, calm down.

29:27.548 --> 29:29.202
Make sure your dad doesn't
see you in this.

29:29.245 --> 29:30.290
Julie?

29:31.508 --> 29:32.379
Oh.

29:35.817 --> 29:37.384
You look...

29:37.427 --> 29:39.821
Scary?

29:39.865 --> 29:42.389
Kind of.

29:42.432 --> 29:44.826
And beautiful.

29:44.870 --> 29:46.219
Awe.

29:55.837 --> 29:57.360
Dad.

29:57.404 --> 30:01.147
Mick, I- I mean, Mr. Turner,
we were just goofing around.

30:01.190 --> 30:03.105
I'm gonna go change.

30:03.149 --> 30:05.325
I'm gonna head to the edge
of the property line.

30:17.772 --> 30:19.034
Hey, valentine.

30:19.078 --> 30:21.994
Chocolate heart
for your thoughts?

30:22.037 --> 30:23.517
That's so sweet.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.127
Do you really wanna know
what I'm thinking?

30:25.171 --> 30:28.043
Yes, I do.

30:28.087 --> 30:29.610
I just saw my daughter
in a wedding dress

30:29.653 --> 30:31.394
and she's quitting school.

30:31.438 --> 30:33.788
And I have to watch my sister
marry a guy I can't stand.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.094
Mmmhmm.

30:35.137 --> 30:36.443
And actually you have
to help plan a wedding

30:36.486 --> 30:38.140
and give her away.

30:38.184 --> 30:39.881
Any more good news?

30:39.925 --> 30:41.709
Just because it's not the
Valentine's weekend we planned

30:41.752 --> 30:44.146
doesn't mean
it can't be good.

30:46.322 --> 30:48.150
I just realized something.

30:50.892 --> 30:52.111
We're alone.

30:53.155 --> 30:55.288
Oh, yeah.

30:55.331 --> 30:56.593
We are.

30:56.637 --> 31:02.164
Just you, me, and Penelope.

31:02.208 --> 31:03.426
She doesn't really count,
does she?

31:03.470 --> 31:04.514
No.

31:04.558 --> 31:05.298
She doesn't even know
your songs.

31:05.341 --> 31:06.908
Yeah.

31:06.952 --> 31:09.824
Unless, of course, we decided
to give her a second chance.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.347
Maybe we should.

31:13.480 --> 31:17.310
Penelope, play something fun
to dance to.

31:46.992 --> 31:48.254
I hope I didn't ruin the moment.

31:48.297 --> 31:49.298
Oh, no, no, no.

31:49.342 --> 31:50.560
We uh, we always dance
like this.

31:50.604 --> 31:52.823
Well, you two look
perfect together.

31:52.867 --> 31:54.695
Listen, Mick, I know
you weren't thrilled

31:54.738 --> 31:57.263
about seeing Julie
in my wedding dress

31:57.306 --> 31:59.613
but I just wanted to say
she was just playing around.

31:59.656 --> 32:01.136
It's a girl thing.

32:01.180 --> 32:05.010
Yeah, he totally understands
and, uh, he's good with it.

32:05.053 --> 32:06.489
Right.

32:06.533 --> 32:10.015
Well, she is growing into
such a lovely young woman.

32:10.058 --> 32:11.320
She is.

32:11.364 --> 32:12.843
Ok, well I better get some sleep
because tomorrow

32:12.887 --> 32:14.323
is my last day
as a single woman.

32:14.367 --> 32:15.585
Yes, it is.

32:15.629 --> 32:16.238
Goodnight, you two.

32:16.282 --> 32:17.718
Goodnight.

32:18.980 --> 32:20.460
Hey.

32:20.503 --> 32:23.463
She is your sister and you
really need to support her.

32:23.506 --> 32:26.814
Do I really have to give her
away to that guy?

32:26.857 --> 32:28.076
Ok.

32:28.120 --> 32:31.645
Can you please stop calling him
"that guy"?

32:39.348 --> 32:41.133
Maybe.

32:48.444 --> 32:49.489
What was his name again?

33:07.376 --> 33:10.031
Awe, he doesn't have his ducks
to sing to.

33:11.424 --> 33:14.949
Yeah, he's, uh, rehearsing
for when they come back.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.082
He always sings from his heart,
doesn't he?

33:17.125 --> 33:18.039
Yeah.

33:18.083 --> 33:20.476
I envy you guys.

33:20.520 --> 33:21.912
You do? Why?

33:21.956 --> 33:25.264
You just seem like
a perfect fit.

33:25.307 --> 33:26.874
How are you feeling
about things?

33:26.917 --> 33:28.963
Um, actually really good.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.965
You know, I'm- I'm glad
we took it slow.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.968
I mean, I know it was not what
your dad wanted but,

33:34.012 --> 33:36.623
you know, it's what I needed
to make sure I knew how I felt.

33:36.666 --> 33:37.754
Yeah.

33:37.798 --> 33:39.843
That's smart.

33:39.887 --> 33:42.672
So... are you sure?

33:44.283 --> 33:47.286
I am sure that I love him
and I am sure that he loves me

33:47.329 --> 33:49.418
but, you know,
relationships take work

33:49.462 --> 33:51.246
and we're not the traditional
couple.

33:51.290 --> 33:52.595
Well, who is?

33:52.639 --> 33:54.119
Speaking of traditional, rings.

33:54.162 --> 33:55.381
Who has the rings?

33:55.424 --> 33:56.643
We need to check in
with Bonnie and Sean.

33:56.686 --> 33:58.297
Right. Right.

34:00.081 --> 34:01.952
We can't have a wedding
without the rings.

34:01.996 --> 34:03.650
No, we cannot.

34:03.693 --> 34:05.652
Well, you girls are at it
early today.

34:05.695 --> 34:06.870
The wedding is tomorrow.

34:06.914 --> 34:10.135
Yes, and here is your list
for today.

34:10.178 --> 34:11.788
Thank you for thinking of me.

34:11.831 --> 34:12.440
You're welcome.

34:12.485 --> 34:13.703
I always do.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.098
Willow Lake Latte.

34:17.141 --> 34:19.143
Or Willow Latte.

34:19.187 --> 34:21.449
Notice the outline of the inn
that I put in the foam?

34:21.494 --> 34:23.539
Which I also put on the steel
cut oatmeal.

34:23.583 --> 34:24.757
Nice touch.

34:24.801 --> 34:26.411
Just wait until you try
my eggs Benedict.

34:26.455 --> 34:27.891
And my pancakes are killer.

34:27.935 --> 34:29.980
Julie, I'm not that hungry.

34:30.024 --> 34:32.940
I- I just wanna show you
what I can do.

34:32.983 --> 34:34.246
Where's Wyatt?

34:34.289 --> 34:35.725
Studying.

34:37.422 --> 34:38.859
I'm cooking for the entire
wedding weekend.

34:38.902 --> 34:39.947
Really?

34:39.989 --> 34:41.208
It's- I mean,
that's a lot to do.

34:41.253 --> 34:42.601
Shouldn't we hire a caterer
or something?

34:42.645 --> 34:44.864
I cooked an entire dinner
for 50 at a frat house

34:44.908 --> 34:46.127
with no help.

34:46.170 --> 34:47.346
Frat house?

34:47.389 --> 34:49.956
Sometimes you need
to just let go and eat.

34:51.306 --> 34:54.875
Well?

34:54.918 --> 34:56.442
It's good.

34:56.485 --> 34:57.878
Really good.

34:57.921 --> 34:58.661
Can I have another bite?

34:58.705 --> 35:00.446
You betcha.

35:00.489 --> 35:01.577
By the end of this weekend

35:01.621 --> 35:04.276
I will have you completely
won over.

35:04.319 --> 35:05.407
There you go.

35:05.451 --> 35:06.060
Thank you.

35:06.104 --> 35:06.887
Yeah.

35:06.930 --> 35:07.540
Good morning, all.

35:07.583 --> 35:08.671
Yes, good morning.

35:08.715 --> 35:09.281
Sean?

35:09.324 --> 35:10.064
Hmm?

35:10.108 --> 35:11.457
Oh, sorry.

35:11.500 --> 35:12.806
His phone will be confiscated
for the nuptials.

35:12.849 --> 35:14.460
Nope.

35:14.503 --> 35:15.548
Who wants a latte?

35:15.591 --> 35:16.375
Oh, yes please.

35:16.418 --> 35:17.637
That'd be great.

35:17.680 --> 35:19.943
So, what's on the agenda
for the day?

35:19.987 --> 35:21.249
Me?

35:21.293 --> 35:23.164
Um, I have a list,
and I have a sound check.

35:23.208 --> 35:24.339
Sound check.

35:24.383 --> 35:25.558
Haven't done one of those
in a while.

35:25.601 --> 35:27.125
Oh, well Sean, why don't you
go with him?

35:27.168 --> 35:28.561
Sean can come
and help you out

35:28.604 --> 35:30.476
and you can come meet me in town
and run errands later.

35:30.519 --> 35:31.651
Oh, no, no.

35:31.694 --> 35:33.043
I'm sure you need
to do wedding stuff.

35:33.087 --> 35:34.262
Well, some of it, but
there's lots of girl stuff

35:34.306 --> 35:36.656
I can do that I do not
need you for.

35:36.699 --> 35:37.396
Yeah, you should go.

35:37.439 --> 35:39.485
Just catch up.

35:39.528 --> 35:41.922
Well, it's a small stage and...

35:41.965 --> 35:44.577
Ah, I've been on small
stages before.

35:44.620 --> 35:45.795
Great.

35:45.839 --> 35:47.797
Julie, can we get the, um,
lattes to go?

35:47.841 --> 35:48.581
Oh, yeah.

35:48.624 --> 35:49.495
Coming right up.

35:49.538 --> 35:50.931
Excellent.

35:50.974 --> 35:51.671
Yeah.

35:51.714 --> 35:52.976
It's gonna be fun.

36:03.639 --> 36:06.642
No sawdust on the floor
so you should be safe.

36:06.686 --> 36:07.687
Yep.

36:11.430 --> 36:12.909
Keyboard's not missing
any keys.

36:12.953 --> 36:14.476
That's a bonus.

36:17.914 --> 36:19.220
Who would have ever thought
me and you

36:19.264 --> 36:21.004
would be on the same stage
together again, huh?

36:21.048 --> 36:23.659
Certainly not me.

36:23.703 --> 36:25.705
Listen, I know you're not
exactly thrilled about me

36:25.748 --> 36:28.882
marrying your sister.

36:28.925 --> 36:30.275
I want my sister to be happy.

36:30.318 --> 36:33.016
That's all I want, too.

36:33.060 --> 36:37.543
Look, I never should have bailed
on you and the band, Mick.

36:37.586 --> 36:41.721
I was young, I was reckless,
selfish.

36:41.764 --> 36:44.811
The thing is, deep down,
I had no confidence

36:44.854 --> 36:47.988
and I knew I'd have to face up
to it someday so here I am.

36:48.031 --> 36:49.468
I'm sorry I took off.

36:49.511 --> 36:51.470
It was the wrong thing
to do.

36:51.513 --> 36:53.254
Well, we were all pretty young.

36:53.298 --> 36:55.604
Yeah, especially me.

36:55.648 --> 36:56.518
But look at you, man.

36:56.562 --> 36:58.259
You're- you're still doing it.

36:58.303 --> 37:00.870
Me, I'm putting clothes
on mannequins now.

37:00.914 --> 37:02.655
You seem like you're doing
pretty well for yourself.

37:02.698 --> 37:04.439
Yeah, but I miss it sometimes.

37:04.483 --> 37:07.964
I mean, nothing compares
to being on stage,

37:08.008 --> 37:10.924
all the guys in the band,
feelin' the music.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.670
This is good.

37:17.713 --> 37:18.671
You write this?

37:18.714 --> 37:20.455
Yeah.

37:20.499 --> 37:22.065
Hey, you mind if I...?

37:59.059 --> 38:00.800
Thank you, Sean.

38:00.843 --> 38:02.149
Wow.

38:02.192 --> 38:02.802
That was fun.

38:04.456 --> 38:06.980
Oh, uh... sorry, I gotta-
I gotta step out.

38:07.023 --> 38:08.851
I gotta take this.

38:09.765 --> 38:10.723
Hello?

38:10.766 --> 38:12.290
No, no, it's all good.

38:14.379 --> 38:16.772
Is he going to play for the show
Sunday, too?

38:16.816 --> 38:19.819
No, he's going to be on his
honeymoon with my sister.

38:23.518 --> 38:24.214
Sean.

38:24.258 --> 38:24.911
Yeah.

38:24.954 --> 38:26.478
You just missed him.

38:26.521 --> 38:28.567
The guy who took off on us
and almost killed our careers

38:28.610 --> 38:29.568
before they got started.

38:29.611 --> 38:30.395
That Sean?

38:30.438 --> 38:31.483
Yeah, that Sean.

38:31.526 --> 38:32.745
And now he's marrying
your sister?

38:32.788 --> 38:33.659
Yeah.

38:33.702 --> 38:34.834
He's in the business world now.

38:34.877 --> 38:35.748
Fashion industry.

38:35.791 --> 38:38.577
Does pretty well for himself.

38:38.620 --> 38:39.969
You trust him?

38:41.623 --> 38:42.668
I'm not sure.

38:42.711 --> 38:43.495
It's his phone.

38:43.538 --> 38:45.018
He's always on his phone.

38:45.061 --> 38:47.237
There's a woman's face
that's come up on caller ID

38:47.281 --> 38:49.979
more than once.

38:50.023 --> 38:51.764
It just bothers me.

38:51.807 --> 38:54.375
Plus, my sister hasn't
known him that long.

38:54.419 --> 38:55.768
Well, you're right to worry.

38:55.811 --> 38:58.118
Worry about what?

38:58.161 --> 38:58.945
Bonnie.

38:58.988 --> 39:00.076
Duke?

39:00.120 --> 39:01.469
Wow.

39:01.513 --> 39:02.775
Awe.

39:02.818 --> 39:03.689
Long time.

39:03.732 --> 39:05.168
So long.

39:05.212 --> 39:07.301
And I hear that congratulations
are in order.

39:07.345 --> 39:08.737
Yes, thank you.

39:08.781 --> 39:09.651
Wow.

39:09.695 --> 39:11.436
This is not such a small stage.

39:11.479 --> 39:13.307
Oh, it's bigger when
nobody's up here.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.526
Where's Sean?

39:14.569 --> 39:16.528
Oh, he got a call
and he had to leave.

39:16.571 --> 39:17.659
Oh.

39:17.703 --> 39:18.965
It must have been
one of his buyers.

39:19.008 --> 39:19.792
Yeah.

39:19.835 --> 39:21.620
Well, I gotta take off.

39:21.663 --> 39:22.316
Great to see you.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.099
You too.

39:23.143 --> 39:24.144
And congratulations.

39:24.187 --> 39:25.058
I'm glad you're happy.

39:25.101 --> 39:26.015
Awe.

39:27.669 --> 39:29.018
I'll talk to you later, Mick.

39:30.759 --> 39:32.718
So, how did sound check go?

39:32.761 --> 39:34.415
Well, the sound is checked.

39:34.459 --> 39:35.721
I mean with Sean.

39:35.764 --> 39:38.245
Oh, good.

39:38.288 --> 39:40.378
That's one of your fake smiles.

39:41.553 --> 39:42.423
Everything's fine.

39:42.467 --> 39:43.511
We're good.

39:43.555 --> 39:45.078
Good, because Olivia
has convinced me

39:45.121 --> 39:46.253
to do cake tastings.

39:46.296 --> 39:47.167
Cake list.

39:47.210 --> 39:48.603
And you are gonna go with me.

39:48.647 --> 39:49.343
Me?

39:49.387 --> 39:50.736
Mmmhmm.

39:50.779 --> 39:51.606
Don't you think you should
do that with the groom?

39:51.650 --> 39:53.129
Oh, he's not a cake person.

39:53.173 --> 39:54.304
Well, I'm a cake person.

39:54.348 --> 39:55.828
I know.

40:02.269 --> 40:06.404
I am not sure... that red.

40:06.447 --> 40:08.014
It's a Valentine's wedding.

40:08.057 --> 40:10.059
I know, but are these people
gonna want to look back

40:10.103 --> 40:14.499
on their wedding photos and go
"ew, Valentine's Day"?

40:14.542 --> 40:18.241
Well, Mom, it is the day of love
so I'd say yes.

40:18.285 --> 40:19.460
Ok, dear.

40:19.504 --> 40:20.635
Whatever you say.

40:20.679 --> 40:21.723
I just want you to be happy.

40:21.767 --> 40:22.942
Great, thank you.

40:22.985 --> 40:24.596
Because I am happy.

40:24.639 --> 40:26.859
Even though you're constantly
throwing weddings for everyone

40:26.902 --> 40:28.077
but yourself.

40:28.121 --> 40:31.733
Mom, I don't need a wedding
to be happy.

40:31.777 --> 40:32.647
Hi, ladies.

40:32.691 --> 40:33.431
Hi.

40:33.474 --> 40:34.649
Hey.

40:34.693 --> 40:36.390
Would you mind sampling
some of my baking?

40:36.434 --> 40:38.871
Would we mind?

40:38.914 --> 40:40.873
Oh my.

40:40.916 --> 40:43.484
You, my dear, are gonna be
a five-star chef one day,

40:43.528 --> 40:44.354
you mark my words.

40:44.398 --> 40:45.617
Awe.

40:45.660 --> 40:47.096
At this point I would settle
for two starts.

40:47.140 --> 40:49.795
And an apron
with my name on it.

40:49.838 --> 40:51.231
Where's that cute boyfriend
of yours?

40:51.274 --> 40:53.451
He's... around.

40:53.494 --> 40:55.061
Somewhere.

40:55.104 --> 40:58.151
Well, maybe I'll be coming back
for your wedding next time.

40:58.194 --> 40:59.413
Oh, I don't know.

40:59.457 --> 41:00.675
I'm- I'm only 20.

41:00.719 --> 41:02.242
20?

41:02.285 --> 41:03.373
That's how old I was when I
got married the first time.

41:03.417 --> 41:04.766
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom,
leave her alone.

41:04.810 --> 41:06.246
Oh.

41:06.289 --> 41:07.465
That is- that is how old I was,
though.

41:07.508 --> 41:08.291
I was 20.

41:08.335 --> 41:09.379
I know that, I know that.

41:09.423 --> 41:10.903
Yeah.

41:10.946 --> 41:13.340
You know, I forgot how great
this town is.

41:13.383 --> 41:15.516
You've made a nice life
for yourself here.

41:15.560 --> 41:16.517
And for Julie.

41:16.561 --> 41:17.910
I hope so.

41:17.953 --> 41:20.042
You've done a good job
raising her.

41:20.086 --> 41:22.567
My job will be done when
she graduates college.

41:22.610 --> 41:24.307
She wants to follow
her dream.

41:24.351 --> 41:28.529
She can follow her dreams
when she finishes school.

41:28.573 --> 41:30.575
Do you know what you told me
when I was Julie's age?

41:30.618 --> 41:32.228
Stay in school?

41:32.272 --> 41:34.796
Follow your passion because it
will lead you to your purpose.

41:34.840 --> 41:35.536
I said that?

41:35.580 --> 41:36.494
Yeah.

41:36.537 --> 41:37.364
That's pretty smart.

41:37.407 --> 41:38.974
Well, you had your moments.

41:39.018 --> 41:40.410
We're here.

41:40.454 --> 41:41.890
Let's go pick some cake.

41:41.934 --> 41:43.501
Ok.

41:56.339 --> 41:58.124
You're unusually quiet.

41:59.952 --> 42:02.694
I am?

42:02.737 --> 42:03.608
What's going on?

42:03.651 --> 42:05.610
You've been weird all weekend.

42:05.653 --> 42:07.699
I just don't get how
this is so easy for you.

42:07.742 --> 42:08.613
What?

42:08.656 --> 42:10.832
Leaving school.

42:10.876 --> 42:12.617
I'll be there,
you'll be here.

42:12.660 --> 42:14.532
How are we supposed
to see each other?

42:18.274 --> 42:19.362
Well...

42:21.756 --> 42:24.803
weekends, I guess?

42:24.846 --> 42:26.239
Yeah.

42:26.282 --> 42:29.155
Well, it won't be the same.

42:29.198 --> 42:32.680
I know, but...

42:32.724 --> 42:35.161
it's not like we're gonna be
in school forever.

42:35.204 --> 42:37.467
But I still have
two more years.

42:37.511 --> 42:39.426
I can't exactly drive out
every weekend.

42:39.469 --> 42:41.123
Well, I don't have a car.

42:41.167 --> 42:42.908
So I'm supposed to drive
hundreds of miles

42:42.951 --> 42:44.387
just to see you?

42:45.780 --> 42:49.001
What do you mean,
just to see me?

42:49.044 --> 42:50.132
I have school and stuff.

42:50.176 --> 42:51.438
I have a life there.

42:51.481 --> 42:52.961
Well, excuse me for intruding
on your life.

42:53.005 --> 42:54.876
No one's forcing you
to do anything.

42:54.920 --> 42:58.619
I am sorry that your decision
affects my life.

42:58.663 --> 43:00.273
You thought it was a good idea.

43:00.316 --> 43:01.404
Yeah, because I didn't think

43:01.448 --> 43:02.754
that you'd actually go
through with it.

43:02.797 --> 43:04.059
So, what?

43:04.103 --> 43:05.365
You figured my dad would
just talk me out of it

43:05.408 --> 43:06.845
and that would be it?

43:06.888 --> 43:08.847
I don't see why you can't
just get a job near campus.

43:08.890 --> 43:11.806
Pizza parlours don't need chefs!

43:11.850 --> 43:13.112
This is my dream, Wyatt.

43:13.155 --> 43:16.550
I can't believe you just
want me to give it up.

43:16.594 --> 43:19.031
I don't.

43:19.074 --> 43:20.859
You don't understand.

43:23.296 --> 43:24.906
I'm gonna head back
to school.

43:27.387 --> 43:31.043
Wait, but- but its- but Sunday's
Valentine's Day.

43:31.086 --> 43:34.263
Yeah, well...

43:34.307 --> 43:36.614
we have to get used to being
without each other,

43:36.657 --> 43:38.790
so might as well start now.

43:50.715 --> 43:52.107
Hi.

43:56.459 --> 43:58.548
Julie?

43:58.592 --> 44:00.594
Are you ok?

44:03.249 --> 44:06.687
What's wrong?

44:06.731 --> 44:10.648
Wyatt and I just had our first
fight and now he's leaving.

44:23.225 --> 44:24.574
These are all so good.

44:24.618 --> 44:25.488
Mmmhmm.

44:25.532 --> 44:26.141
You're in the wedding business.

44:26.185 --> 44:27.012
How do you decide?

44:27.055 --> 44:28.143
Olivia handles this.

44:28.187 --> 44:30.189
I'm primarily just an eater.

44:30.232 --> 44:32.147
Ah, ok.

44:32.191 --> 44:34.846
So let me... let me get
this straight.

44:34.889 --> 44:36.064
She does the menus.

44:36.108 --> 44:36.891
Mmmhmm.

44:36.935 --> 44:37.762
She does the flowers.

44:37.805 --> 44:38.632
Right.

44:38.676 --> 44:39.285
Place settings.

44:39.328 --> 44:41.548
Mmmhmm.

44:41.591 --> 44:42.680
What do you do?

44:42.723 --> 44:44.769
Pretty much what
she tells me to.

44:44.812 --> 44:46.118
No wonder it's going
so well.

44:46.161 --> 44:47.554
Actually, it is.

44:47.597 --> 44:50.688
She's... she's had a great
effect on the place.

44:50.731 --> 44:52.733
And on you.

44:52.777 --> 44:54.779
And me.

44:54.822 --> 44:56.868
You know, I think dad would be
really happy to know

44:56.911 --> 44:58.783
that you're giving me away.

44:58.826 --> 44:59.958
Yeah.

45:02.612 --> 45:03.570
About that.

45:03.613 --> 45:05.398
What about that?

45:05.441 --> 45:08.140
Is this about Sean?

45:08.183 --> 45:09.141
I'm worried about you.

45:09.184 --> 45:10.620
Ugh, Mick.

45:10.664 --> 45:12.753
I just want to make sure you're
picking the right guy.

45:12.797 --> 45:13.972
I am.

45:14.015 --> 45:15.756
Honestly.

45:15.800 --> 45:17.279
I know you're my big brother

45:17.323 --> 45:18.498
and you feel the need
to protect me

45:18.541 --> 45:20.456
but you don't have to,
not anymore.

45:20.500 --> 45:22.763
Why is he always texting
and always on his phone?

45:22.807 --> 45:23.764
It's business.

45:23.808 --> 45:24.504
Are you sure?

45:24.547 --> 45:26.158
Yes! What is going on?

45:26.201 --> 45:28.116
I thought that you and Sean had
worked all of this out already.

45:28.160 --> 45:30.510
Well, I thought we did, too,
until a call came in

45:30.553 --> 45:32.294
and a woman's face came up
on the caller ID

45:32.338 --> 45:34.079
and it's not the first time
I've seen her.

45:34.122 --> 45:35.254
He just grabbed it
and took off.

45:36.603 --> 45:38.083
I know you and Sean have
a little bit of history

45:38.126 --> 45:39.649
with each other
but I don't.

45:39.693 --> 45:40.781
Exactly.

45:40.825 --> 45:42.391
You should have a history
with him.

45:42.435 --> 45:43.610
Especially if you're gonna plan
on committing

45:43.653 --> 45:45.046
the rest of your life to him.

45:45.090 --> 45:46.091
Oh, really?

45:46.134 --> 45:47.570
Ok, so what do you suggest
I do?

45:47.614 --> 45:49.921
Wait another two decades like
you have with Olivia?

45:49.964 --> 45:51.487
You know, honestly, I really
don't know that you should

45:51.531 --> 45:52.880
be giving me relationship
advice.

45:52.924 --> 45:54.664
My situation is completely
different.

45:54.708 --> 45:56.231
Is it?

45:56.275 --> 45:57.755
Because you've basically been
in love with her forever.

45:57.798 --> 45:58.712
And we're together.

45:58.756 --> 46:00.061
Are you?

46:00.105 --> 46:02.498
Because you pretty much live in
a wedding chapel.

46:02.542 --> 46:04.196
You spend all of your free time
planning weddings

46:04.239 --> 46:05.327
for other people.

46:05.371 --> 46:06.676
What're you waiting for?

46:06.720 --> 46:08.069
And have you made a decision?

46:08.113 --> 46:09.505
No.

46:09.549 --> 46:10.724
My brother will make the
decision because apparently

46:10.768 --> 46:13.509
I'm not capable of making one
on my own.

46:13.553 --> 46:16.121
I will give you some more time.

46:17.731 --> 46:18.384
Ugh.

46:18.427 --> 46:19.777
This was a mistake.

46:21.169 --> 46:22.083
I never should have come here.

46:22.127 --> 46:22.997
Hey, Bonnie-

46:23.041 --> 46:24.564
No!

46:24.607 --> 46:27.045
Mick, I am marrying Sean whether
you approve of it or not.

46:27.088 --> 46:27.872
And forget about the wedding.

46:27.915 --> 46:29.395
We'll find somewhere else.

46:29.438 --> 46:29.961
Bonnie-

46:30.004 --> 46:31.310
No.

46:44.932 --> 46:46.760
I wish I didn't love him.

46:46.804 --> 46:48.588
I feel sick right now.

46:48.631 --> 46:49.807
I know, sweetie.

46:49.850 --> 46:51.678
He was always there for me.

46:51.721 --> 46:53.593
He cut onions for me
and everyone knows

46:53.636 --> 46:55.943
that's the worst job.

46:55.987 --> 46:59.599
Everything is just gonna
remind me of him.

46:59.642 --> 47:02.863
How am I gonna go out on the
lake again or go to the movies?

47:02.907 --> 47:05.126
I won't even be able to cook
with onions again.

47:05.170 --> 47:06.562
Oh, honey.

47:06.606 --> 47:08.042
Onions are overrated.

47:08.086 --> 47:09.522
No, they're not.

47:09.565 --> 47:11.698
They're really important.

47:11.741 --> 47:13.134
Come here.

47:14.832 --> 47:16.790
I took him for granted.

47:16.834 --> 47:18.923
I've been so selfish.

47:18.966 --> 47:20.968
Everything's gonna be ok.

47:30.935 --> 47:32.545
Bonnie, hi.

47:34.155 --> 47:35.200
Cake problems?

47:35.243 --> 47:36.070
No cake.

47:36.114 --> 47:36.897
No wedding.

47:36.941 --> 47:38.203
I mean, at least not here.

47:38.246 --> 47:39.987
Olivia, I'm sorry.

47:42.511 --> 47:43.730
Bonnie?

47:46.515 --> 47:47.255
What happened?

47:47.299 --> 47:48.561
What did you say to her?

47:48.604 --> 47:49.562
I tried to talk her out of
marrying this guy

47:49.605 --> 47:51.216
in between bites.

47:51.259 --> 47:52.130
Mick.

47:52.173 --> 47:53.348
Yeah.

47:55.046 --> 47:58.005
I don't know what to do,
Olivia.

47:58.049 --> 48:02.053
Bonnie told me that you had
to take over for your dad

48:02.096 --> 48:03.054
when he died.

48:05.404 --> 48:07.928
I can't imagine how hard
that must have been.

48:10.365 --> 48:14.021
But um, I think it's time
to let go.

48:15.718 --> 48:17.459
You're a good man.

48:17.503 --> 48:19.026
But flawed.

48:19.070 --> 48:21.594
Who isn't?

48:21.637 --> 48:23.161
How do I fix this?

48:23.204 --> 48:27.992
Well, I think that maybe you
should go on an apology tour.

48:30.168 --> 48:32.692
Yeah, I guess I could do that.

48:32.735 --> 48:34.999
Oh, Julie and Wyatt broke up.

48:35.042 --> 48:35.956
What?

48:36.000 --> 48:37.131
Is that because of me, too?

48:37.175 --> 48:38.480
Actually, no.

48:38.524 --> 48:39.264
Well, is she ok?

48:39.307 --> 48:40.004
Where is she?

48:40.047 --> 48:40.961
She's in her room.

48:41.005 --> 48:41.875
Where is he?

48:41.919 --> 48:42.963
I don't know.

48:43.007 --> 48:44.269
Packing maybe?

48:59.153 --> 49:00.198
Julie?

49:00.241 --> 49:01.547
Yeah?

49:01.590 --> 49:03.984
You wanna talk?

49:04.028 --> 49:05.203
No.

49:06.421 --> 49:07.640
You sure?

49:09.424 --> 49:10.599
Yeah.

49:25.440 --> 49:26.789
Wyatt!

49:28.095 --> 49:30.837
Hey, what's up?

49:30.880 --> 49:33.753
I'm going back to school.

49:33.796 --> 49:36.234
Julie and I, we broke up.

49:36.277 --> 49:38.410
Yeah, I heard.

49:38.453 --> 49:40.151
You wanna talk about it?

49:43.110 --> 49:44.503
I agree with you.

49:44.546 --> 49:47.810
I don't want Julie
to leave school.

49:47.854 --> 49:50.030
I guess we're just
on separate paths.

49:50.074 --> 49:52.641
Gotcha.

49:52.685 --> 49:55.601
Maybe we need to take a minute
and think about this, huh?

49:55.644 --> 49:56.906
We both know Julie's
really serious

49:56.950 --> 49:58.908
about what she wants, right?

49:58.952 --> 50:00.345
Yeah.

50:00.388 --> 50:03.087
We both love her and want her
to be happy, right?

50:03.130 --> 50:04.392
Yeah.

50:04.436 --> 50:05.741
Well, maybe we're the ones
who need to change

50:05.785 --> 50:09.267
the way we're thinking.

50:09.310 --> 50:11.573
Tell you what.

50:11.617 --> 50:14.750
Before you go why don't you just
go into town

50:14.794 --> 50:16.970
and get a sandwich or something
and just think about

50:17.014 --> 50:20.104
all the things you love
about Julie.

50:20.147 --> 50:21.801
And I'll do the same.

50:26.110 --> 50:28.112
Thanks, Mr. Turner.

50:28.155 --> 50:30.027
Mick.

50:47.783 --> 50:49.133
Can I come in?

50:49.176 --> 50:50.569
Sure.

50:54.703 --> 50:56.444
I'm sorry.

50:56.488 --> 50:57.837
I've been holding onto the past

50:57.880 --> 51:00.144
and I've been making
this about me.

51:00.187 --> 51:02.102
Oh, I'm sorry.

51:02.146 --> 51:05.018
You know I didn't mean what
I said about you and Olivia.

51:05.062 --> 51:06.063
That's ok.

51:06.106 --> 51:07.107
You guys love each
other so much,

51:07.151 --> 51:09.283
it'll all work out.

51:09.327 --> 51:12.547
Oh, you know Mick, sometimes
you can't control every minute,

51:12.591 --> 51:15.855
you just... need to learn
to let things just happen.

51:15.898 --> 51:18.945
I know.

51:18.988 --> 51:20.599
I'm just so proud of you.

51:20.642 --> 51:21.600
I mean, look at you.

51:21.643 --> 51:23.906
Your life, your career.

51:23.950 --> 51:26.257
I just don't say
that often enough.

51:26.300 --> 51:27.432
I say things I shouldn't.

51:30.478 --> 51:31.523
Nothing would make me happier

51:31.566 --> 51:33.873
than to see my sister
get married.

51:33.916 --> 51:35.092
It's your life.

51:35.135 --> 51:37.050
I just wanna be part of it.

51:37.094 --> 51:38.617
I want that, too.

51:38.660 --> 51:39.574
Can you forgive me?

51:39.618 --> 51:41.315
Oh, come on.

51:44.884 --> 51:47.365
Ok, Sean's next
on my apology tour.

51:47.408 --> 51:48.627
You know where
I can find him?

51:48.670 --> 51:50.281
Well, unfortunately
that will have to wait.

51:50.324 --> 51:52.370
He, uh, he had to fly
to New York.

51:52.413 --> 51:53.632
He what?

51:53.675 --> 51:54.633
it's just- it's an emergency
with a buyer.

51:54.676 --> 51:56.025
He'll be back by tonight.

51:56.069 --> 51:57.462
But everything's ok, right?

51:57.505 --> 51:58.593
Of course.

51:58.637 --> 52:00.682
Honestly, this happens
all the time.

52:00.726 --> 52:02.554
Hey, you're not supposed
to worry about me anymore,

52:02.597 --> 52:03.816
you remember?

52:03.859 --> 52:05.034
I was gonna take Olivia
somewhere real quick

52:05.078 --> 52:07.385
but if you need me
to stick around I will.

52:07.428 --> 52:08.951
No, don't keep Olivia waiting.

52:08.995 --> 52:10.562
You know what I'm gonna do?

52:10.605 --> 52:12.216
I am gonna spend the rest of
the day taking my niece shopping

52:12.259 --> 52:14.653
because I think we could both
use a little retail therapy.

52:14.696 --> 52:17.569
Mmm. Ok.

52:17.612 --> 52:19.136
Thanks.

52:34.063 --> 52:36.109
Sean, it's me again.

52:36.153 --> 52:37.110
Please, call me back.

52:37.154 --> 52:39.025
I really need to talk to you.

53:03.702 --> 53:05.312
Hey, what's wrong?

53:05.356 --> 53:06.531
This whole last minute
wedding thing,

53:06.574 --> 53:07.619
that's what's wrong.

53:07.662 --> 53:09.229
Something's going on with Sean.

53:09.273 --> 53:10.491
Mick, we've been through this.

53:10.535 --> 53:11.753
No, but this is different.

53:11.797 --> 53:13.494
The guy has completely
disappeared, Olivia.

53:13.538 --> 53:15.104
Bonnie says it happens
all the time,

53:15.148 --> 53:17.411
it's a business thing,
but I can tell she's upset.

53:17.455 --> 53:19.544
Ok, you need to let her
handle this.

53:19.587 --> 53:20.458
Well, what if she can't?

53:20.501 --> 53:21.720
She can.

53:23.504 --> 53:25.637
You know, sometimes you need
to just put her feelings

53:25.680 --> 53:27.247
in front of your own.

53:27.291 --> 53:28.335
What's that supposed to mean?

53:28.379 --> 53:29.467
Rushing in and being
a saviour

53:29.510 --> 53:31.033
might make you feel good

53:31.077 --> 53:32.992
but it's not what Bonnie
needs right now.

53:33.035 --> 53:33.558
I don't-

53:33.601 --> 53:35.081
You do. You do.

53:35.124 --> 53:38.345
You rush in and try to fix
everyone's problems.

53:38.389 --> 53:40.434
Sometimes you have to just
let things happen.

53:40.478 --> 53:42.567
Take their own time.

53:42.610 --> 53:43.785
I think I'm pretty good at

53:43.829 --> 53:44.917
letting things take
their own time,

53:44.960 --> 53:46.223
you of all people
should know that.

53:48.747 --> 53:51.793
I wasn't talking about us.

53:51.837 --> 53:53.404
Right.

53:55.667 --> 53:58.191
I think I'm gonna take a walk
and clear my head.

55:06.259 --> 55:08.217
Oh, hey Duke.

55:08.261 --> 55:09.218
Hi.

55:09.262 --> 55:10.916
Uh, have you seen
Mick around?

55:10.959 --> 55:13.527
No, I haven't seen him lately.

55:13.571 --> 55:15.007
Is everything alright?

55:15.050 --> 55:16.313
Uh...

55:20.099 --> 55:23.407
it's just, Mick is really,
really concerned

55:23.450 --> 55:26.410
about his sister marrying Sean.

55:26.453 --> 55:28.890
Well, I can't say
that I blame him.

55:28.934 --> 55:32.285
Yeah, I- I know, I know
all the history and I just...

55:32.329 --> 55:34.461
I feel like maybe I pushed him
a bit too far.

55:34.505 --> 55:35.680
Oh.

55:35.723 --> 55:38.117
Well, that could be a problem.

55:38.160 --> 55:38.944
Yeah.

55:38.987 --> 55:40.511
Yeah, I- I'm seeing that.

55:40.554 --> 55:42.991
Um, any suggestions?

55:43.035 --> 55:47.561
Well, he is an artist,
he is overly protective

55:47.605 --> 55:49.694
and he is very stubborn.

55:49.737 --> 55:51.086
Right.

55:51.130 --> 55:53.524
So you're saying that if I want
to change his mind

55:53.567 --> 55:57.136
about something then I should
just wait it out?

55:57.179 --> 55:58.180
Yeah.

55:58.224 --> 55:59.356
He'll come around.

55:59.399 --> 56:00.792
Eventually.

56:00.835 --> 56:03.185
Take it from a guy that
has spent years on the road

56:03.229 --> 56:04.970
with Mick Turner.

56:05.013 --> 56:06.841
It will pay off ten fold.

56:06.885 --> 56:08.974
Ok. Got it.

56:09.017 --> 56:09.801
Thank you.

56:09.844 --> 56:11.063
You're welcome.

56:12.325 --> 56:13.979
And you didn't hear it
from me.

56:14.022 --> 56:16.155
No, our secret.

56:30.909 --> 56:32.737
Hey.

56:32.780 --> 56:34.391
I've been looking for you.

56:34.434 --> 56:37.176
Funny, I've been looking
for you, too.

56:37.219 --> 56:38.873
Hop in.

56:58.545 --> 57:00.504
Thank you, aunt Bonnie.

57:00.547 --> 57:02.854
Oh, sweetheart, I know
it didn't help.

57:02.897 --> 57:05.683
But did it help just a little?

57:05.726 --> 57:08.033
I didn't think about Wyatt once.

57:08.076 --> 57:10.122
Well, except in the last store

57:10.165 --> 57:12.733
because we bought t-shirts there
once, but...

57:12.777 --> 57:15.214
Yeah, and the coffee shop
you bought coffee in once

57:15.257 --> 57:16.389
or the ice cream parlour

57:16.433 --> 57:20.524
that made you cry
when we passed it.

57:20.567 --> 57:21.742
That obvious?

57:21.786 --> 57:22.482
A little.

57:22.526 --> 57:24.049
But you know what?

57:24.092 --> 57:25.877
That's ok because you can't
fall out of love in one day.

57:25.920 --> 57:27.095
Well, he did.

57:27.139 --> 57:29.228
I can promise you he didn't.

57:29.271 --> 57:31.230
I'm sure he's just as miserable
as you are.

57:31.273 --> 57:33.362
Yeah, I hope so.

57:33.406 --> 57:35.408
You're so lucky, you don't have
to go through this.

57:35.452 --> 57:37.715
You have Sean.

57:37.758 --> 57:40.152
And I hope you come here
more often when you're married.

57:40.195 --> 57:41.719
Oh, me too.

57:43.242 --> 57:44.461
Oh, sweetheart,
it's gonna be ok.

57:47.115 --> 57:48.421
I'm gonna go start dinner.

57:48.465 --> 57:49.814
Great.

57:51.250 --> 57:51.990
Your pre-wedding feast.

57:52.033 --> 57:52.643
You'll love it.

57:52.686 --> 57:54.079
Oh, I can't wait.

58:06.874 --> 58:08.093
You wanted horses?

58:08.136 --> 58:09.834
You got horses.

58:09.877 --> 58:12.271
You are so romantic.

58:12.314 --> 58:13.664
That's what I was shooting for.

58:13.707 --> 58:15.013
Oh, it's perfect.

58:15.056 --> 58:16.057
Glad you like it.

58:16.101 --> 58:17.145
Oh.

58:17.189 --> 58:17.755
Hey.

58:17.798 --> 58:19.539
Oh, hi.

58:19.583 --> 58:21.759
Hey.

58:21.802 --> 58:23.195
I'm really sorry about before.

58:23.238 --> 58:25.023
I- I didn't mean to push you.

58:25.066 --> 58:26.894
Oh, there's nothing
to apologize for.

58:26.938 --> 58:28.505
I think I'm the one
who overreacted.

58:28.548 --> 58:31.769
Yeah, well you're allowed to do
that every once in a while.

58:31.812 --> 58:32.987
You're right.

58:33.031 --> 58:34.119
I shouldn't get in other
people's business.

58:34.162 --> 58:35.555
I always wanna jump in
and fix things.

58:35.599 --> 58:38.253
I'm just gonna let Bonnie deal
with Sean on her own.

58:38.297 --> 58:39.428
Good.

58:39.472 --> 58:40.604
I also talked to Wyatt.

58:40.647 --> 58:41.256
You did?

58:41.300 --> 58:42.257
How'd it go?

58:42.301 --> 58:44.695
Well, I guess we'll see.

58:44.738 --> 58:46.914
Well, m'lady, should we, uh,
saddle up

58:46.958 --> 58:49.134
and ride off into
the almost sunset?

58:49.177 --> 58:50.527
I would love to.

58:50.570 --> 58:51.702
Would you let us in there,
please?

58:51.745 --> 58:53.573
Excuse us.

58:53.617 --> 58:54.661
Hi.

58:57.316 --> 59:01.407
I just thought I'd mention
your horse's name is Tornado.

59:01.450 --> 59:03.322
Yeah, ok.

59:03.365 --> 59:05.019
Good luck.

59:36.573 --> 59:40.925
You know how people say
they wish they were 18 again?

59:40.968 --> 59:44.102
I think it's better now.

59:44.145 --> 59:46.539
Just think if I hadn't gotten
on that tour bus.

59:46.583 --> 59:48.193
We might not have ever split up.

59:48.236 --> 59:49.760
Oh, we may have anyway.

59:49.803 --> 59:52.980
I just don't think
it was our time.

59:53.024 --> 59:54.591
How about now?

59:57.158 --> 01:00:02.033
Now feels a lot closer
to our time.

01:00:02.076 --> 01:00:03.512
It's weird, I'm, like,

01:00:03.556 --> 01:00:07.691
I'm a little scared
but then not and...

01:00:07.734 --> 01:00:08.779
do you know what
I mean?

01:00:08.822 --> 01:00:12.217
Yeah. I think so.

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.915
What about you?

01:00:14.959 --> 01:00:19.180
I think you're the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen.

01:00:19.224 --> 01:00:21.139
I like that.

01:00:38.199 --> 01:00:40.724
Hey, Mom.

01:00:40.767 --> 01:00:42.073
What're you doing?

01:00:42.116 --> 01:00:44.162
Well, I thought we could use
some centerpieces

01:00:44.205 --> 01:00:47.600
and that little florist in town
had these beautiful orchids.

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:49.297
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

01:00:49.341 --> 01:00:50.690
We have plenty of
flowers already.

01:00:50.734 --> 01:00:53.214
Oh, but not white ones.

01:00:53.258 --> 01:00:54.607
White.

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:58.132
Of course, because my
Valentine's theme is pink.

01:00:58.176 --> 01:01:00.787
These are just more traditional,
honey.

01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:04.661
I'm gonna go change.

01:01:06.401 --> 01:01:07.664
What?

01:01:07.707 --> 01:01:08.969
Am I wrong?

01:01:09.013 --> 01:01:11.232
Are these not perfect
for a wedding?

01:01:11.276 --> 01:01:12.799
No, you're not wrong,

01:01:12.843 --> 01:01:14.583
I just think maybe your approach
to Olivia

01:01:14.627 --> 01:01:17.238
is a little too harsh, Nora.

01:01:17.282 --> 01:01:19.066
She values your opinion
and she loves you

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:21.068
which is why she gets
so hurt like this

01:01:21.112 --> 01:01:22.374
when you criticize her.

01:01:22.417 --> 01:01:23.418
Criticize her?

01:01:23.462 --> 01:01:25.029
Yeah, that's how it comes off.

01:01:25.072 --> 01:01:26.857
Not all the time,
but a compliment

01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:29.207
wouldn't hurt now and then.

01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:31.949
And let's be honest,
no matter what age,

01:01:31.992 --> 01:01:34.952
every girl always wants
her mother's approval.

01:01:34.995 --> 01:01:36.475
Right?

01:01:36.518 --> 01:01:38.433
Yeah.

01:01:38.477 --> 01:01:40.174
Yeah. Thanks, Mick.

01:01:40.218 --> 01:01:43.743
Well, I'm gonna go change
so you got all this handled?

01:01:43.787 --> 01:01:45.005
Yeah.

01:01:45.049 --> 01:01:46.703
Yeah, I think so.

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:57.409
Hi.

01:01:57.452 --> 01:01:59.454
How was the ride?

01:01:59.498 --> 01:02:01.065
It was good.

01:02:01.108 --> 01:02:03.110
Real good.

01:02:03.154 --> 01:02:05.156
How are you?

01:02:05.199 --> 01:02:06.418
Good.

01:02:16.123 --> 01:02:18.604
Wyatt and I had a fight.

01:02:21.389 --> 01:02:23.783
And he doesn't want me
to leave school

01:02:23.827 --> 01:02:26.481
because he thinks if we don't
see each other every day

01:02:26.525 --> 01:02:29.615
then it'll be over.

01:02:37.841 --> 01:02:41.279
Maybe I should
just finish school.

01:02:41.322 --> 01:02:44.108
Absolutely not.

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:48.634
I thought that's
what you wanted.

01:02:48.677 --> 01:02:51.202
Well, it is what I want
but it's not what you want.

01:02:51.245 --> 01:02:53.291
You have to make the decision
on this, Julie.

01:02:53.334 --> 01:02:56.729
It can't be about a boy
or about your dad.

01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:59.210
Now, that being said,

01:02:59.253 --> 01:03:01.908
no matter how old you get I'm
always gonna be your father.

01:03:04.128 --> 01:03:08.741
The truth is I think you'd make
a great chef.

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:12.963
Really?

01:03:14.965 --> 01:03:17.402
You gotta follow your dreams,
honey, I did.

01:03:17.445 --> 01:03:20.405
Even if it takes you to
the kitchen here at the inn.

01:03:23.538 --> 01:03:25.366
I love you, Dad.

01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:27.586
I love you, too.

01:03:32.852 --> 01:03:34.767
Are you sure we
shouldn't wait for Sean?

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:35.986
Oh, no. It's fine.

01:03:36.029 --> 01:03:38.336
He'll get here eventually.

01:03:38.379 --> 01:03:40.251
You look beautiful, Bonnie.

01:03:40.294 --> 01:03:42.296
Thank you, Nora.

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:44.342
You look beautiful tonight, too,
Olivia.

01:03:44.385 --> 01:03:45.517
Tonight?

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.084
As opposed to last night,
or tomorrow?

01:03:47.127 --> 01:03:48.868
No, you look beautiful tonight

01:03:48.912 --> 01:03:50.870
and you looked beautiful
last night.

01:03:50.914 --> 01:03:53.090
Oh, thank you, Mom.

01:03:53.133 --> 01:03:55.483
However, I can't vouch
for tomorrow.

01:03:55.527 --> 01:03:56.354
There's our Nora.

01:03:57.790 --> 01:03:59.357
You had us worried there
for a moment, sweetheart.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:00.575
Here we go.

01:04:00.619 --> 01:04:01.968
This is the next masterpiece

01:04:02.012 --> 01:04:05.885
from our wonderful
culinary expert, chef Julie.

01:04:05.929 --> 01:04:06.451
Oh, wow.

01:04:06.494 --> 01:04:07.365
Julie.

01:04:07.408 --> 01:04:08.845
Julie, this is incredible.

01:04:08.888 --> 01:04:10.934
And tonight I am baking
a special wedding cake

01:04:10.977 --> 01:04:12.892
since somebody didn't get one.

01:04:12.936 --> 01:04:14.241
Thank you, sweetheart.

01:04:14.285 --> 01:04:15.286
Wow.

01:04:15.329 --> 01:04:16.461
Oh my goodness,
this is gorgeous.

01:04:16.504 --> 01:04:17.505
Bon apetit, everyone.

01:04:17.549 --> 01:04:18.550
Bon apetit.

01:04:18.593 --> 01:04:19.856
Thank you.

01:04:22.684 --> 01:04:24.730
Bonnie?

01:04:24.773 --> 01:04:26.732
Here, there's something
I want you to have.

01:04:26.775 --> 01:04:28.386
For me?

01:04:28.429 --> 01:04:29.953
And Sean.

01:04:38.222 --> 01:04:40.354
Oh, it's my dad's tie clip.

01:04:40.398 --> 01:04:42.356
Awe.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.270
Oh, Mick.

01:04:43.314 --> 01:04:44.968
I haven't seen this in so long.

01:04:45.011 --> 01:04:47.187
I didn't even know
you still had it.

01:04:47.231 --> 01:04:50.930
I've been hanging on to it
just 'cause.

01:04:50.974 --> 01:04:53.237
I thought maybe Sean would want
to wear it at the wedding.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.891
Thank you.

01:04:54.934 --> 01:04:56.893
That means so much to me.

01:05:02.507 --> 01:05:03.900
Alright.

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.211
You guys.

01:05:13.648 --> 01:05:16.956
I, uh, I wanna thank you.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.437
All of you.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.569
You know, I've- I've been away
for so long

01:05:21.613 --> 01:05:25.965
I forgot what it felt like
to be with family.

01:05:26.009 --> 01:05:27.097
And I know that I said

01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:28.881
that I wasn't a wedding
person anymore

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:35.496
but the truth is I am.

01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:38.064
I want it all.

01:05:38.108 --> 01:05:41.938
I... I want the dress
and the flowers

01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:46.855
and I want to remember
every moment,

01:05:46.899 --> 01:05:49.728
like dad's tie clip,

01:05:49.771 --> 01:05:52.644
and the cake,

01:05:52.687 --> 01:05:54.254
and all the beautiful colours.

01:05:54.298 --> 01:05:55.777
I'm sorry.

01:05:55.821 --> 01:05:58.911
I, uh, I just didn't realize
what an effect being here

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:00.434
would have on me.

01:06:00.478 --> 01:06:01.827
Excuse me.

01:06:04.003 --> 01:06:05.048
Excuse us.

01:06:09.748 --> 01:06:11.228
Bonnie, hey.

01:06:11.271 --> 01:06:12.838
Hey, hey.

01:06:14.274 --> 01:06:15.928
What- what is it?

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:17.234
I'm so sorry, you guys.

01:06:17.277 --> 01:06:19.453
I didn't want to be one of
those crying brides.

01:06:19.497 --> 01:06:21.760
That's ok, all the brides
we have here cry.

01:06:21.803 --> 01:06:22.979
Most of the grooms, too.

01:06:23.022 --> 01:06:24.763
Yeah, well I'm hoping
there is a groom.

01:06:24.806 --> 01:06:25.677
What's going on?

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:27.418
Mick, what if you were right?

01:06:27.461 --> 01:06:28.723
I mean, really.

01:06:28.767 --> 01:06:30.856
Who walks out the day
before their wedding?

01:06:30.899 --> 01:06:32.640
What business could be more
important than us?

01:06:32.684 --> 01:06:33.815
And you know what?

01:06:33.859 --> 01:06:35.208
Now he's not even answering
his phone.

01:06:35.252 --> 01:06:37.602
Yeah, well the cell reception
here is terrible.

01:06:37.645 --> 01:06:39.212
Yeah, it's- it's bad.

01:06:39.256 --> 01:06:42.041
That hasn't stopped him from
taking calls all weekend long.

01:06:42.085 --> 01:06:43.782
You guys, I've been making
excuses for him

01:06:43.825 --> 01:06:45.436
since we got here.

01:06:45.479 --> 01:06:49.135
I don't know, I... I think I may
have just been blinded by love.

01:06:49.179 --> 01:06:50.571
Now, listen.

01:06:50.615 --> 01:06:52.312
What I said about him,
I- I really shouldn't have.

01:06:52.356 --> 01:06:53.705
I don't even know the guy.

01:06:53.748 --> 01:06:56.316
Yeah, well I'm starting
to wonder if I do, either.

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.188
And let's be honest,
he walked out on you

01:06:58.231 --> 01:07:00.146
when you needed him
the most, Mick.

01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:01.060
Well, but that was music.

01:07:01.104 --> 01:07:02.192
It was years ago, Bonnie.

01:07:02.235 --> 01:07:03.802
He still walked out on you.

01:07:10.374 --> 01:07:11.244
That's him.

01:07:11.288 --> 01:07:13.333
Hey.

01:07:13.377 --> 01:07:15.379
You want me to go out there?

01:07:15.422 --> 01:07:18.034
No, but thank you.

01:07:25.258 --> 01:07:28.914
I'll be just on the other side
of the door.

01:07:28.957 --> 01:07:30.872
I know.

01:07:40.012 --> 01:07:42.319
Well, I guess that's dinner.

01:07:59.814 --> 01:08:02.426
Look, I'll uh,
I'll call you back.

01:08:03.818 --> 01:08:04.819
Hey, Bon.

01:08:04.863 --> 01:08:07.344
What- what're you doing
out here?

01:08:07.387 --> 01:08:08.867
Where were you?

01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:10.434
I told you, I was in New York.

01:08:10.477 --> 01:08:12.740
No, Sean, you and I, we have
always said that we wouldn't

01:08:12.784 --> 01:08:15.526
keep things from each other
but you've been lying to me.

01:08:15.569 --> 01:08:16.875
You've been lying to me
all weekend

01:08:16.917 --> 01:08:18.398
and we're not even married yet.

01:08:18.442 --> 01:08:19.573
Bonnie, I-

01:08:19.617 --> 01:08:21.140
No.

01:08:21.184 --> 01:08:23.011
Please, I mean, what's gonna
happen a year down the line

01:08:23.055 --> 01:08:24.317
or five?

01:08:24.361 --> 01:08:25.710
You know I love you.

01:08:25.752 --> 01:08:28.452
If you love me then you're gonna
be honest with me.

01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:33.196
You're right.

01:08:33.238 --> 01:08:36.154
I have been keeping something
from you.

01:08:36.198 --> 01:08:37.721
And I'm sorry.

01:08:39.767 --> 01:08:41.551
They've been out there
a long time.

01:08:41.595 --> 01:08:43.902
Maybe they're working
things out.

01:08:43.944 --> 01:08:44.946
Well, what takes longer?

01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:46.078
Working things out
or breaking up?

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:47.210
I don't know.

01:08:53.999 --> 01:08:55.653
He was with another woman.

01:08:58.090 --> 01:09:00.571
Her name is Francesca.

01:09:00.613 --> 01:09:03.008
Francesca?

01:09:03.051 --> 01:09:09.362
And she happens to be one of
the top wedding dress designers

01:09:09.406 --> 01:09:11.147
in New York.

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:13.410
And I'm gonna be wearing
one of her creations.

01:09:13.453 --> 01:09:15.020
What?

01:09:15.063 --> 01:09:16.848
I can't have my bride wear a
last-minute dress off the rack.

01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:18.197
Oh.

01:09:18.241 --> 01:09:19.676
He wanted to give me
the wedding of my dreams.

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:22.941
Listen, guys, I'm sorry if I
ruined things around here,

01:09:22.984 --> 01:09:25.161
I just wanted to surprise her.

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:27.075
And you did.

01:09:27.118 --> 01:09:28.511
I am so sorry I doubted you.

01:09:28.555 --> 01:09:29.904
Oh, honey.

01:09:29.948 --> 01:09:32.341
This is, like, the most romantic
thing ever.

01:09:32.385 --> 01:09:33.604
And that's not all.

01:09:33.647 --> 01:09:34.692
Bridesmaid's dresses.

01:09:34.734 --> 01:09:36.694
Olivia, Julie.

01:09:36.737 --> 01:09:38.609
I can't remember the last time
I was a bridesmaid.

01:09:38.652 --> 01:09:39.783
And one for you.

01:09:39.827 --> 01:09:41.133
I don't know what to say.

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:42.961
And Nora, we can't have you
going underdressed

01:09:43.004 --> 01:09:44.788
on this joyous occasion.

01:09:44.832 --> 01:09:46.617
I have never been underdressed.

01:09:47.661 --> 01:09:48.836
But thank you.

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.621
Listen, guys, if it's alright
with you

01:09:50.663 --> 01:09:53.014
we're gonna catch
a later flight out.

01:09:53.058 --> 01:09:55.539
We heard that there's a
Valentine's Day concert

01:09:55.582 --> 01:09:57.584
that we really wanna go to.

01:09:57.628 --> 01:10:00.152
We would absolutely love that.

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:01.371
I can't wait to see this dress.

01:10:04.025 --> 01:10:05.288
Mick?

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:10.510
Look, in case you still have
your doubts I want you to know

01:10:10.554 --> 01:10:12.730
I love your sister and
I'm gonna take care of her

01:10:12.773 --> 01:10:14.253
for the rest of her life.

01:10:14.297 --> 01:10:15.950
I'm gonna hold you to that.

01:10:15.994 --> 01:10:17.778
Yeah, I know you will.

01:10:17.822 --> 01:10:19.476
So we good?

01:10:21.173 --> 01:10:22.392
We're good.

01:10:41.324 --> 01:10:42.412
Oh.

01:10:42.455 --> 01:10:44.109
This is really happening.

01:10:44.152 --> 01:10:45.284
I'm getting married.

01:10:45.328 --> 01:10:46.024
Yes, you are.

01:10:46.067 --> 01:10:47.547
It's finally happening.

01:10:47.591 --> 01:10:49.245
It's so exciting.

01:10:52.291 --> 01:10:55.294
You know, I- I can't believe
that I just-

01:10:55.338 --> 01:10:56.556
I wanted to rush
through everything

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.690
because now I just want it
to last forever.

01:10:59.733 --> 01:11:01.344
Bonnie, you look so beautiful.

01:11:01.387 --> 01:11:02.780
Thank you.

01:11:04.347 --> 01:11:05.870
My hair.

01:11:05.913 --> 01:11:07.741
What should I do
with my hair?

01:11:07.785 --> 01:11:09.743
Right, ok.

01:11:09.787 --> 01:11:11.876
I think that we should
just do an updo.

01:11:11.919 --> 01:11:12.920
It's quick and easy
and beautiful.

01:11:12.964 --> 01:11:13.617
I love it.

01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:15.183
Me too.

01:11:15.227 --> 01:11:17.708
I'm so happy you guys are here
and I'm with you.

01:11:17.751 --> 01:11:18.970
Me too.

01:11:19.013 --> 01:11:20.188
So happy to be here.

01:11:20.232 --> 01:11:21.407
I love you.

01:11:42.776 --> 01:11:43.908
Am I too late?

01:11:43.951 --> 01:11:45.866
Wyatt?

01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:48.434
Wh- what're you doing here?
I thought you left last night.

01:11:48.478 --> 01:11:51.655
Your dad gave me a room on
the other side of the house.

01:11:51.698 --> 01:11:52.699
He gave me a chance to think
of all the reasons

01:11:52.743 --> 01:11:54.397
why I'm so in love with you.

01:11:57.791 --> 01:11:59.358
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

01:11:59.402 --> 01:12:00.794
I missed you.

01:12:00.838 --> 01:12:02.840
No, I- I should have talked it
over with you first.

01:12:02.883 --> 01:12:03.884
It's ok, I get it.

01:12:03.928 --> 01:12:05.582
I'm sorry, it was so selfish.

01:12:05.625 --> 01:12:07.018
No, I was selfish.

01:12:07.061 --> 01:12:08.759
We can work this out.

01:12:08.802 --> 01:12:10.717
Yeah, we have weekends
and holidays-

01:12:10.761 --> 01:12:11.675
And summers.

01:12:11.718 --> 01:12:13.198
And I can take the train.

01:12:16.941 --> 01:12:17.942
Sorry.

01:12:17.985 --> 01:12:19.944
Sorry.

01:12:19.987 --> 01:12:21.598
Continue.

01:12:21.641 --> 01:12:23.339
Shall we begin?

01:12:34.828 --> 01:12:38.354
Promise you'll be there for me
always, no matter what.

01:12:38.397 --> 01:12:40.443
I thought you wanted me
to stay out of things.

01:12:40.486 --> 01:12:42.445
I do want you to stay out of
things but I also want you

01:12:42.488 --> 01:12:44.316
to be there for me always.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.318
Much clearer.

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:47.319
Love you.

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:48.494
Love you.

01:13:02.116 --> 01:13:05.381
There's something special
about a Valentine's wedding.

01:13:05.424 --> 01:13:08.079
After all, this is a day devoted
to love,

01:13:08.122 --> 01:13:11.387
and a wedding is a beautiful
ritual that allows two people

01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:15.086
to devote themselves
to the love of each other.

01:13:15.129 --> 01:13:18.872
Sometimes I get asked how do
you know when it's true love?

01:13:18.916 --> 01:13:21.222
And I always say
the same thing.

01:13:21.266 --> 01:13:24.312
When true love comes along,
you'll know.

01:13:24.356 --> 01:13:27.577
And grab it.

01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:30.928
I believe Bonnie and Sean
have some last minute vows?

01:13:33.931 --> 01:13:39.197
Bonnie, I vow to love you
and to cherish you always,

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.025
and to not check my phone
outside the hours

01:13:41.068 --> 01:13:42.679
of 9:00 to 5:00.

01:13:42.722 --> 01:13:44.811
Or, let's be honest,
9:00 to 6:00.

01:13:44.855 --> 01:13:48.685
Unless, of course,
it's you calling.

01:13:48.728 --> 01:13:53.472
Oh, Sean, I vow to love
and cherish you, too.

01:13:53.516 --> 01:13:55.866
And I will never doubt
you again.

01:13:55.909 --> 01:14:00.044
We have the rest of our lives
to learn both about

01:14:00.087 --> 01:14:03.047
and from each other,
and I can't wait.

01:14:03.090 --> 01:14:04.440
Sean?

01:14:04.483 --> 01:14:07.225
Do you take Bonnie to be
your lawfully wedded wife?

01:14:07.268 --> 01:14:08.748
I do.

01:14:08.792 --> 01:14:10.184
And Bonnie?

01:14:10.228 --> 01:14:12.665
Do you take Sean to be your
lawfully wedded husband?

01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:14.667
I do.

01:14:14.711 --> 01:14:15.842
Well, then.

01:14:15.886 --> 01:14:18.366
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:14:19.585 --> 01:14:21.718
You may kiss your bride.

01:14:55.708 --> 01:14:56.840
Thank you.

01:14:58.711 --> 01:15:00.191
Thank you.

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:02.628
Thank you.

01:15:04.543 --> 01:15:06.763
Well, thank you all very much
for coming out tonight

01:15:06.806 --> 01:15:08.025
and happy Valentine's Day, ok?

01:15:13.465 --> 01:15:16.424
Now, it's uh, sometimes
it's not always easy

01:15:16.468 --> 01:15:17.948
to find love, right?

01:15:17.991 --> 01:15:20.254
And sometimes it can be
right in front of you

01:15:20.298 --> 01:15:21.908
and you don't even know it.

01:15:21.952 --> 01:15:24.607
I personally believe that
there's someone out there

01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:26.130
for all of us.

01:15:26.173 --> 01:15:30.177
There certainly is for me
and um, she's here tonight.

01:15:30.221 --> 01:15:34.007
She doesn't know it but um,
I wrote this song for her.

Everyone come here.

01:17:16.283 --> 01:17:18.503
I want us all to enjoy
this beautiful gazebo

01:17:18.546 --> 01:17:20.374
on our last night together.

01:17:20.418 --> 01:17:21.201
Ok?

01:17:21.245 --> 01:17:22.507
That sounds perfect.

01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:23.160
It's amazing.

01:17:23.203 --> 01:17:23.856
I love it here.

01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:24.857
I love you.

01:17:24.901 --> 01:17:25.684
I love you.

01:17:26.598 --> 01:17:27.686
My wife.

01:17:27.730 --> 01:17:29.993
My husband.

01:17:30.036 --> 01:17:34.345
I loved the song.

01:17:34.388 --> 01:17:36.652
And I love the guy
who wrote it.

01:17:46.792 --> 01:17:48.402
Look at these two.

01:17:48.446 --> 01:17:50.622
I've never seen
my dad like this.

01:17:50.666 --> 01:17:52.580
It's 'cause they are
in love.

01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:57.760
I am so happy
for you.

01:17:57.803 --> 01:17:59.239
I- I wanna make a toast.

01:17:59.283 --> 01:18:02.199
Olivia, Mick, come on up here.

01:18:02.242 --> 01:18:05.593
I just- I just want to say
thank you for having us all

01:18:05.637 --> 01:18:07.900
on your Valentine's weekend

01:18:07.944 --> 01:18:10.773
and for making it so lovely.

01:18:10.816 --> 01:18:13.514
I'm so proud of you, darling.

01:18:13.558 --> 01:18:14.777
Awe.

01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:16.692
Thank you, Mom.

01:18:16.735 --> 01:18:18.084
I'm getting all sentimental.

01:18:18.128 --> 01:18:19.346
It's just...

01:18:21.827 --> 01:18:23.481
Happy Valentine's?

01:18:23.524 --> 01:18:24.482
Cheers, everybody.

01:18:24.525 --> 01:18:25.222
Cheers!

01:18:26.832 --> 01:18:28.225
Cheers.

01:18:32.664 --> 01:18:34.448
Thanks so much.

01:18:34.492 --> 01:18:35.188
Awe.

01:18:35.232 --> 01:18:36.407
Fantastic.

01:18:36.450 --> 01:18:37.103
Best visit ever.

01:18:37.147 --> 01:18:38.757
Congratulations.

01:18:38.801 --> 01:18:39.758
Thank you so much.

01:18:39.802 --> 01:18:40.890
Happy Valentine's weekend.

01:18:40.933 --> 01:18:42.195
Yes, I know.

01:18:42.239 --> 01:18:43.588
So happy for you.

01:18:43.631 --> 01:18:44.676
Alrighty.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:45.851
Alright.

01:18:48.593 --> 01:18:49.594
Bye.

01:18:55.643 --> 01:18:56.601
Bye, Mom!

01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:01.780
Dad.

01:19:01.824 --> 01:19:02.955
Hey.

01:19:02.999 --> 01:19:05.001
Wyatt and I came up
with a great idea.

01:19:05.044 --> 01:19:06.219
I'm listening.

01:19:06.263 --> 01:19:09.222
I take a gap year to give
cooking a try

01:19:09.266 --> 01:19:13.923
and then I go back
and finish college.

01:19:13.966 --> 01:19:15.359
I think it's a great idea.

01:19:15.402 --> 01:19:16.273
I think so, too.

01:19:16.316 --> 01:19:17.230
I love it.

01:19:17.274 --> 01:19:18.014
I love you.

01:19:18.057 --> 01:19:19.189
I love you, too, Daddy.

01:19:19.232 --> 01:19:20.146
See ya honey.

01:19:20.190 --> 01:19:20.799
See ya.

01:19:20.843 --> 01:19:21.582
Bye.

01:19:21.626 --> 01:19:23.019
Thanks Mick.

01:19:24.455 --> 01:19:25.456
Be safe, ok?

01:19:25.499 --> 01:19:27.110
We will.

01:19:27.153 --> 01:19:30.287
Oh, you guys, this weekend
turned out perfectly.

01:19:30.330 --> 01:19:31.418
Just like I hoped it would.

01:19:31.462 --> 01:19:32.593
I'm so glad.

01:19:32.637 --> 01:19:34.073
We would like to come back
for Easter.

01:19:34.117 --> 01:19:35.901
If that's ok with you guys.

01:19:37.511 --> 01:19:38.469
I guess so.

01:19:38.512 --> 01:19:39.644
And we're gonna stay in touch.

01:19:39.687 --> 01:19:40.732
You bet.

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:44.475
I want you to have this.

01:19:50.873 --> 01:19:52.613
You never know when
it might come in handy.

01:19:56.008 --> 01:19:56.922
I love you.

01:19:56.966 --> 01:19:58.794
I love you.

01:19:59.838 --> 01:20:00.447
Thank you again.

01:20:00.491 --> 01:20:01.361
Thank you so much.

01:20:01.405 --> 01:20:03.146
Mick, pleasure.

01:20:03.189 --> 01:20:05.670
Take care.

01:20:05.713 --> 01:20:06.323
Bye.

01:20:06.366 --> 01:20:07.324
Bye.

01:20:09.543 --> 01:20:11.023
Do you have our
boarding passes?

01:20:11.067 --> 01:20:14.461
I got the boarding passes
printed, we are good to go.

01:20:14.505 --> 01:20:15.723
Bye, guys.

01:20:15.767 --> 01:20:17.334
Bye.

01:20:22.818 --> 01:20:24.471
Did all of this
really just happen?

01:20:26.125 --> 01:20:27.779
Yeah.

01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:31.043
And it was pretty amazing,
wasn't it?

01:20:31.087 --> 01:20:32.610
It was.

01:20:32.653 --> 01:20:34.786
It wasn't quite the Valentine's
weekend we had planned...

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:36.875
But it all worked out.

01:20:36.919 --> 01:20:38.834
Yeah, it did.

01:20:43.621 --> 01:20:46.493
Can I still ask you to be
my valentine?

01:20:46.537 --> 01:20:48.017
Please do.

01:20:50.846 --> 01:20:54.762
Actually, there's a couple
things I'd like to ask you.

01:20:54.806 --> 01:20:56.025
Really?

01:21:00.203 --> 01:21:02.466
What else did you wanna
ask me?

01:21:02.509 --> 01:21:04.076
I think I may need to wait
for a sign

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:05.991
before I ask that question.

01:21:12.693 --> 01:21:14.130
The ducks
are back early.

01:21:14.173 --> 01:21:15.218
What do you know?

01:21:17.046 --> 01:21:19.439
Maybe that's a sign.

01:21:19.483 --> 01:21:21.224
Maybe it is.
