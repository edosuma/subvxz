WEBVTT

00:05.770 --> 00:08.173
D.P.S. found her
by the oil fields near Beaumont.

00:08.207 --> 00:10.443
- Erratic, hostile, no ID.
- (female screaming in the background)

00:10.476 --> 00:11.396
We couldn't identify her

00:11.421 --> 00:12.445
- through collateral contacts.
- (glass breaking)

00:12.477 --> 00:14.513
- Psychosis is pretty elaborate.
- Very.

00:14.547 --> 00:16.749
Mood stabilizers
and anti-psychotics had no effect.

00:16.782 --> 00:20.385
- This one will.
- (screaming getting louder)

00:20.419 --> 00:22.422
(male grunting)

00:24.457 --> 00:26.055
She bit her wrist!

00:27.225 --> 00:29.528
- MALE DOCTOR: Hold her down.
- ORDERLY: It's not that easy.

00:29.562 --> 00:33.767
KATE: No! No! No... (groans)

00:34.866 --> 00:37.637
(Kate panting)

00:44.743 --> 00:46.377
MALE DOCTOR: <i>Amaru...</i>

00:47.325 --> 00:48.843
Wanna talk about that?

00:49.973 --> 00:52.475
I googled it. It means...

00:52.673 --> 00:54.484
serpent or dragon.

00:54.841 --> 00:57.979
South American folklore. Right?

00:59.599 --> 01:01.081
Is that your name?

01:04.686 --> 01:06.676
Tell me about your time in the desert.

01:08.089 --> 01:09.460
It's done.

01:10.331 --> 01:11.993
I... I can't hear you. What's that?

01:15.062 --> 01:17.564
Today is my awakening.

01:18.298 --> 01:19.956
That's what this was?

01:21.002 --> 01:22.303
Then, tell me...

01:22.336 --> 01:24.812
what exactly awoke?

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:34.148 --> 01:35.531
Can we pray?

01:36.668 --> 01:37.851
Excuse me?

01:38.212 --> 01:40.422
That is what you people do, isn't it?

01:41.083 --> 01:42.423
Pray?

01:42.457 --> 01:44.816
Why don't you tell me what
you wanna pray about instead?

01:46.393 --> 01:47.895
Please?

01:48.256 --> 01:50.764
It would make me feel so much better.

01:51.039 --> 01:53.867
I'm sorry. It'd be unprofessional.

01:55.937 --> 01:57.806
But I wanna pray.

01:58.872 --> 02:00.041
I wanna pray.

02:00.074 --> 02:01.109
I wanna pray.

02:01.142 --> 02:02.777
I. Want.

02:02.809 --> 02:04.778
(screaming) To! Pray!

02:04.812 --> 02:08.482
- Right now!
- Orderly! Orderly!

02:09.079 --> 02:10.785
- (Kate exhales)
- (doctor's voice trembles)

02:15.990 --> 02:18.260
(doctor groans)

02:19.427 --> 02:22.264
(doctor screaming)

02:47.154 --> 02:48.389
MAN: <i>Mi reina...</i>

02:48.421 --> 02:50.425
Is it really you?

02:53.027 --> 02:54.568
It is you.

02:56.430 --> 02:58.332
Let us begin.

02:58.366 --> 02:59.719
Shall we?

03:11.145 --> 03:13.181
(theme music playing)

03:30.479 --> 03:39.189
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

03:41.875 --> 03:44.479
- Hey, it was close.
- No, it wasn't.

03:44.511 --> 03:46.880
And, can you
not cheer so loud next time?

03:46.914 --> 03:48.216
I'll shut up when you hit the ball.

03:48.248 --> 03:50.571
- That's hilarious, Dad.
- (chuckles)

03:51.252 --> 03:53.073
Oh, shit. Dad.

03:53.587 --> 03:57.124
Hey, can y'all uh...
spare a little change?

03:57.158 --> 03:59.027
I'm sorry. I don't have any cash,

03:59.059 --> 04:00.829
but I got oranges in the back
you can sink your teeth into.

04:00.861 --> 04:02.665
Surely do appreciate it.

04:04.998 --> 04:06.835
(sound of fangs extruding)

04:14.508 --> 04:18.045
- Dad, Dad!
- (culebra growling)

04:18.079 --> 04:20.915
(culebra lets out muffled grunt)

04:20.947 --> 04:23.417
- I think you got lost, pal.
- (culebra snarling)

04:24.951 --> 04:26.920
It's OK, folks. Early Halloween prank.

04:26.954 --> 04:29.624
Go on home now.

04:29.656 --> 04:33.327
I heard of you. You're the <i>rinche.</i>

04:33.360 --> 04:36.163
I prefer "ranger."

04:36.196 --> 04:38.232
(click of handcuff)

04:52.112 --> 04:53.875
Peacekeeper.

04:54.982 --> 04:56.417
You got a little blood on your lip.

04:56.912 --> 04:59.085
- I do?
- Not really.

04:59.492 --> 05:00.532
What took you so long?

05:00.566 --> 05:02.273
I'm sorry, <i>vaquero,</i>

05:02.305 --> 05:03.380
It's not like we didn't just suffer

05:03.405 --> 05:04.457
an attack unlike anything
we've ever seen.

05:04.492 --> 05:06.015
I'm aware of that.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.620
And it's only a matter of time
before another demon

05:07.645 --> 05:09.562
from hell comes at us again.

05:09.596 --> 05:11.466
So, do you mind telling me
what I'm doing in the suburbs?

05:11.499 --> 05:13.600
The suburbs are fair game now.

05:13.634 --> 05:16.872
It's been nothing but chaos
since the other lords got massacred.

05:17.504 --> 05:20.633
He's one of Difunto's from Waco.

05:21.141 --> 05:23.211
He thinks he can feed on your turf.

05:23.244 --> 05:24.679
Lord Venganza has bigger problems

05:24.711 --> 05:26.480
than worrying about
who feeds in her territory.

05:26.514 --> 05:28.049
I told you, it ain't by choice.

05:28.081 --> 05:29.951
Shut up. Those were innocent folks.

05:29.983 --> 05:32.219
You people are supposed to be
feeding on border rats and bikers.

05:32.252 --> 05:33.921
CULEBRA: It ain't by choice.

05:33.954 --> 05:36.223
- God dammit, what did I just...
- Hold on a second!

05:36.256 --> 05:37.766
What do you mean it's not by choice?

05:37.798 --> 05:40.228
We can't go back to Waco.
They'd burn us alive down there.

05:40.261 --> 05:42.263
- You mean staking you?
- No!

05:42.295 --> 05:45.165
I mean houses full of snakes
going up in flames. Immolating.

05:45.199 --> 05:46.234
It's hell on earth down there.

05:46.266 --> 05:48.235
Hell on earth, huh?

05:48.268 --> 05:50.939
- You think this could be...
- Yes.

05:50.971 --> 05:52.205
We've been hearing
about attacks like this

05:52.239 --> 05:54.609
all up and down culebra territory.

05:54.641 --> 05:56.276
- Let him go.
- What?

05:56.309 --> 05:58.278
<i>Su√©ltalo.</i> We have to get to Waco

05:58.312 --> 06:00.514
before there's no more peace
left for you to keep.

06:02.550 --> 06:05.520
- (growling)
- (grunting)

06:07.254 --> 06:09.490
All right! Enough already!

06:09.523 --> 06:11.393
(growling stops)

06:15.528 --> 06:17.497
Maybe I haven't been clear.

06:17.530 --> 06:19.466
There's a gang of demons out there.

06:19.499 --> 06:22.002
They come straight out of hell.

06:22.035 --> 06:24.907
They killed the lords,
and now, it is their aim

06:24.941 --> 06:27.854
to turn each and every one of us
into top-quality shoes,

06:27.879 --> 06:29.815
boots, and purses.

06:30.478 --> 06:31.984
Do you wanna die?

06:32.871 --> 06:34.378
Or do you wanna live?

06:34.411 --> 06:37.018
If you prefer the latter, you need
to check your shit at the door,

06:37.050 --> 06:39.619
and start acting like a real crew.

06:39.653 --> 06:42.735
Now, why in the fuck
should we listen to you

06:43.523 --> 06:45.559
and your meat-sack brother.

06:45.593 --> 06:46.732
Don't.

06:49.696 --> 06:51.325
Listen to yourselves.

06:52.033 --> 06:54.669
Snapping at each other like the goddamned
bottom feeders that you are.

06:54.701 --> 06:56.636
(nervous chuckle) He...
he doesn't mean anything by that.

06:56.670 --> 06:58.773
SETH: Shut up, Richard.

06:58.805 --> 07:01.276
You ever see what happens when
you cut the head off of a snake?

07:02.643 --> 07:05.445
I wiggles around
like a fish out of water...

07:06.047 --> 07:08.222
until somebody comes along and eats it.

07:09.050 --> 07:12.086
Which is exactly what's gonna
happen to you two without a boss.

07:12.119 --> 07:15.155
Boss? You gonna cut us in your business?

07:18.526 --> 07:20.127
There is no business.

07:20.160 --> 07:21.795
I may not be one of you...

07:21.829 --> 07:24.165
but I stuck around for this shit show

07:24.197 --> 07:26.633
because we are all duly fucked here.

07:26.667 --> 07:29.037
We might as well have
contracts on our heads,

07:29.069 --> 07:33.341
because these scumbags are not gonna
stop until we are all good and dead.

07:33.983 --> 07:35.242
So...

07:35.861 --> 07:37.510
are you in...

07:37.545 --> 07:39.180
or are you out?

07:40.680 --> 07:42.615
Didn't you used to run
with Santanico Pandemonium?

07:42.648 --> 07:44.117
Jesus Christ. You see? You see...

07:44.151 --> 07:48.122
Now, <i>that</i> is a culebra
we can all get behind.

07:48.155 --> 07:49.590
Well, she's gone.

07:49.622 --> 07:50.791
- So...
- CULEBRA: So...

07:50.824 --> 07:52.292
we're gone too.

07:52.326 --> 07:53.660
CULEBRA 2: For once, I agree.

07:53.694 --> 07:55.450
Hey, let's roll, boys!

07:56.430 --> 07:57.737
SETH: Great.

07:58.466 --> 08:00.442
That's just great. (sighs)

08:01.167 --> 08:02.136
Hmm...

08:02.168 --> 08:03.704
What?

08:04.162 --> 08:06.773
A thousand times I told you
we need to go get her.

08:06.807 --> 08:08.417
And I told you to drop it.

08:09.105 --> 08:11.379
- Well, you got any better ideas?
- (Richie sighs)

08:12.879 --> 08:14.648
We don't even know where she is.

08:14.682 --> 08:16.717
Lalo already told me you're
keeping tabs on her, alright?

08:16.749 --> 08:19.922
She's in... <i>Piedras Negras,</i> right?

08:20.858 --> 08:22.322
We leave now,
we can be there by midnight.

08:22.355 --> 08:24.091
It's a waste of time.
She'll never sign up.

08:24.124 --> 08:26.009
Well, there's only one way
we're gonna find out.

08:26.681 --> 08:29.696
Unless you wanna keep mopin'
around here about your ex-girlfriend.

08:29.730 --> 08:32.662
- It's not about that.
- Then, what is it about, Richard?

08:33.765 --> 08:35.703
The wheels are coming off
the goddamn world here.

08:36.437 --> 08:39.807
We're just a couple
of... punks from K.C.

08:39.839 --> 08:43.363
If we're gonna survive this,
we need all the help we can get.

08:46.275 --> 08:48.347
- You're not gonna regret this.
- I already do.

08:48.381 --> 08:50.251
Look, these monsters
came out of her temple, right?

08:50.284 --> 08:52.319
She's gotta know a thing
or two about how to kill 'em.

08:52.353 --> 08:54.622
RICHIE: Santanico's the biggest
monster of them all, brother.

08:54.655 --> 08:58.559
Yeah, exactamundo.
Nobody fucks with the queen.

09:12.772 --> 09:14.742
(distorted voices)

09:14.775 --> 09:16.910
<i>She's gotta know a thing
or two about how to kill 'em.</i>

09:16.944 --> 09:19.680
<i>Santanico's the biggest
monster of them all, brother.</i>

09:19.713 --> 09:22.717
<i>Exactamundo.
Nobody fucks with the queen.</i>

09:31.758 --> 09:35.129
There can be only one queen.

09:41.468 --> 09:47.541
(crowd chanting) Kisa! Kisa!
Kisa! Kisa! Kisa! Kisa!

09:47.574 --> 09:49.343
(chanting continues)

10:27.314 --> 10:30.251
RICHIE: Well, (sighs) this
definitely sounds like the place.

10:30.284 --> 10:32.753
All I'm saying is, she was your first.

10:32.785 --> 10:34.856
You never forget your first.

10:37.324 --> 10:38.693
She wasn't my first.

10:38.726 --> 10:41.395
Not your "first." That was Mary Palmer.

10:41.428 --> 10:43.331
I mean your first... you know...

10:43.363 --> 10:45.432
No, I don't know.

10:45.465 --> 10:46.900
There's nothing wrong with getting
caught up on a dame, Richard.

10:46.934 --> 10:48.535
RICHIE: Can we get on with this now?

10:48.569 --> 10:50.805
(crowd cheering)

10:50.838 --> 10:54.909
ANNOUNCER: <i>Cabrones y cabronas!</i>
It's time for our next fight.

10:54.941 --> 10:57.010
The hour of power!

10:57.044 --> 10:58.478
I give you...

10:58.511 --> 11:01.281
Kilroy verses Tit√°n!

11:01.314 --> 11:03.218
- (announcer laughs)
- (crowd applauding)

11:04.385 --> 11:06.688
Definitely the right place.

11:20.333 --> 11:21.669
- You seein' all this?
- Yeah.

11:21.702 --> 11:23.604
A room full of unsuspecting feed bags.

11:23.636 --> 11:25.473
Substitute fights for lapdances,

11:25.506 --> 11:28.276
and it's the Titty Twister
all over again.

11:28.309 --> 11:30.377
How many of 'em
do you think are in here?

11:30.410 --> 11:33.381
(grunting)

11:33.414 --> 11:35.283
I got no idea.

11:35.315 --> 11:36.917
What, do you think we can all
smell each other or something?

11:39.319 --> 11:42.323
- Oh!
- (crowd going "aww")

11:44.391 --> 11:47.962
- (gurgle of gushing blood)
- (pounding of pulse)

11:47.995 --> 11:50.765
(pattering of dripping blood)

11:55.069 --> 11:56.404
(snarls)

11:56.436 --> 11:58.005
There goes the dinner bell.

12:06.012 --> 12:07.648
(screeching)

12:11.452 --> 12:13.621
(crowd murmuring)

12:16.924 --> 12:20.528
Out there, the world is full
of savages and tyrants.

12:20.560 --> 12:24.631
Out there, we've all been victims
and slaves. But in here,

12:24.665 --> 12:26.766
we live with dignity and freedom!

12:26.800 --> 12:28.502
(crowd cheers)

12:29.803 --> 12:34.008
And we do that
by sticking to three rules.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.898
Rule number one.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.746
Every man fights for himself!

12:38.779 --> 12:40.443
Rule number two.

12:40.881 --> 12:43.483
You fight on the floor,
you fight in the ring!

12:43.516 --> 12:45.319
(crowd cheers)

12:46.420 --> 12:48.346
And rule number three.

12:53.861 --> 12:55.254
No weapons.

12:56.127 --> 12:59.832
You break the rules, we break you!

12:59.867 --> 13:01.769
(crowd cheers)

13:01.801 --> 13:04.938
- (Santanico speaking foreign language)
- (crowd agitated)

13:15.715 --> 13:17.984
(wind whistling)

13:20.487 --> 13:21.923
(woman grunts)

13:27.728 --> 13:29.997
(slurping)

13:38.805 --> 13:41.041
A desperate time for reptiles.

13:42.476 --> 13:44.579
How did you get in here?

13:47.848 --> 13:49.916
This is a place of sacrilege.

13:50.242 --> 13:51.506
Excuse me?

13:52.118 --> 13:53.458
There she is.

13:55.655 --> 13:58.459
Look at how you've
dolled up your false idol.

14:00.160 --> 14:02.195
Like putting lipstick on a pig.

14:03.028 --> 14:04.997
Who the hell you callin' pig?

14:08.734 --> 14:11.326
You know, I've destroyed
so many of these houses.

14:12.321 --> 14:16.544
They're all the same. Vermin
like you, feeding on flesh.

14:16.577 --> 14:19.814
But there's always one
who spreads her lies.

14:20.657 --> 14:23.020
I can't imagine that would be you.

14:25.551 --> 14:27.086
I know the culebras are in a panic,

14:27.120 --> 14:30.858
gathering, trying
to stop the inevitable.

14:31.858 --> 14:32.995
So, I ask you,

14:34.255 --> 14:37.665
where are Santanico's
apostles congregating?

14:37.698 --> 14:42.069
Dude, I don't know if you're
supposed to be Roy Batty or what,

14:42.360 --> 14:44.636
but I don't know what the fuck
you're talkin' about.

14:44.670 --> 14:47.641
Is that what <i>La Diosa</i> teaches you?

14:48.976 --> 14:50.745
Defiance?

14:53.747 --> 14:56.817
Jesus, man. What the fuck are you?

14:56.849 --> 14:57.984
A messenger.

14:58.017 --> 15:00.653
To stop a plague like Santanico,

15:00.686 --> 15:02.655
you can't just destroy the source.

15:03.135 --> 15:06.760
You have to incinerate
every single soul she's infected.

15:06.793 --> 15:08.095
Yo, man, how 'bout you suck my...

15:08.127 --> 15:09.662
- (flesh being pierced)
- (culebra grunts)

15:09.695 --> 15:11.831
(culebra groaning)

15:15.902 --> 15:20.039
<i>La Diosa...</i> will save me...

15:20.073 --> 15:22.141
No, she won't.

15:22.175 --> 15:25.679
By tonight, your queen will be dead.

15:25.712 --> 15:27.481
(culebra groans)

15:32.565 --> 15:35.318
I said... show some goddamn respect.

15:35.352 --> 15:37.951
All right. All right, I'm sorry.

15:39.255 --> 15:40.623
Kisa, please...

15:40.655 --> 15:43.403
This man, Titan, he raped my sister.

15:43.436 --> 15:45.935
Revenge is a treacherous
road, my friend.

15:46.562 --> 15:48.597
Believe me, I would know.

15:50.732 --> 15:52.136
So, tell me...

15:53.568 --> 15:55.938
what should I do with you now?

15:57.872 --> 16:00.008
RICHIE: Oh, shit.

16:00.042 --> 16:02.645
She's gonna tear
that guy apart. Come on.

16:04.980 --> 16:08.518
Hey... open the door.

16:13.722 --> 16:15.257
Allow me.

16:18.459 --> 16:19.895
(slithering sound)

16:21.630 --> 16:23.499
Open the goddamn door.

16:28.536 --> 16:31.240
I'm sorry, we interrupting your dinner?

16:32.473 --> 16:33.943
It's all right.

16:35.044 --> 16:36.345
You know these knuckleheads?

16:37.313 --> 16:38.664
Sorry, knuckleheads?

16:39.414 --> 16:40.705
No, no, no.

16:41.350 --> 16:42.385
No, we're old friends,

16:42.418 --> 16:43.673
aren't we?

16:44.086 --> 16:46.897
- And this guy here's her old...
- Partner.

16:47.456 --> 16:49.359
- Business partner.
- (Santanico chuckles)

16:50.491 --> 16:52.537
<i>Esta bien,</i> Manola.

16:53.595 --> 16:54.797
They are old friends.

16:55.736 --> 16:57.697
And he was my business partner.

16:58.929 --> 17:01.504
But we don't do business
in the old ways any more, do we?

17:01.536 --> 17:03.838
No, we do not.

17:03.871 --> 17:05.906
SETH: Oh, you're not into
the old ways anymore.

17:05.941 --> 17:09.311
Um, question. What exactly were
you going to do with him, then?

17:09.345 --> 17:10.680
Just the lap dance part?

17:11.680 --> 17:12.847
Still funny, Seth.

17:12.881 --> 17:16.308
No. You see, he has a choice.

17:16.917 --> 17:19.054
You made your vendetta my problem.

17:19.540 --> 17:22.357
So, either you pay for that man's injury
with a dozen free fights,

17:22.391 --> 17:23.826
or you're banished for good.

17:23.858 --> 17:25.560
Let me stay, Kisa, please.

17:26.595 --> 17:27.896
Please!

17:30.098 --> 17:31.533
Take him.

17:34.502 --> 17:36.672
See, people here have a choice.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.840
No one's kept against their will.

17:39.875 --> 17:41.644
Yeah, clearly.

17:41.945 --> 17:45.080
And I don't turn people anymore,
unless they ask for it.

17:45.847 --> 17:48.526
Hold on. She's not even a...

17:48.559 --> 17:51.019
No. I'm not a culebra.

17:51.052 --> 17:54.055
But trust me, I know all about you.

17:54.088 --> 17:56.338
- OK, Santanico, we...
- My name is Kisa.

17:57.418 --> 17:59.894
And whatever you have to offer,
I'm sure I'm not interested.

18:00.493 --> 18:01.830
The Lords are dead.

18:01.864 --> 18:05.340
I know. I'm all broken
up about it, can't you tell?

18:07.341 --> 18:09.704
- Leave.
- They were killed by a Xibalban.

18:11.874 --> 18:13.060
The first of many.

18:13.924 --> 18:14.908
KISA: <i>I can't help you.</i>

18:15.459 --> 18:16.978
These things came out of your temple.

18:17.011 --> 18:19.514
It's never been my temple, Richard.
I was just a prisoner.

18:19.548 --> 18:22.417
And now you want me to help you
save whatever was left behind?

18:22.451 --> 18:24.086
Not what, who, OK?

18:24.118 --> 18:26.422
Your people look up to you.

18:26.454 --> 18:28.857
They are not gonna follow us,
they are gonna follow their queen.

18:28.891 --> 18:30.900
I'm not their queen, Seth.

18:31.559 --> 18:35.063
For the first time in a thousand years,
I have something that's mine.

18:36.055 --> 18:37.893
There's no way I'm gonna
give that up for you.

18:37.925 --> 18:40.468
Then, someone's gonna
take it away from you.

18:40.501 --> 18:42.501
Trust me. We've been there.

18:42.937 --> 18:44.806
I'll take my chances.

18:50.145 --> 18:52.548
XIMENA: There. Pull over.

19:01.956 --> 19:03.328
You sure you can handle that thing?

19:03.362 --> 19:05.193
Actually, I prefer a bigger piece,

19:05.227 --> 19:07.463
but I don't think you've got
anything like that in your arsenal.

19:07.495 --> 19:09.597
- Whoa, whoa. I'll take the lead.
- Says who?

19:09.631 --> 19:13.102
You're the one who keeps reminding
me I'm the Peacekeeper.

19:13.135 --> 19:14.737
You know, if we're
gonna be working together,

19:14.770 --> 19:16.704
maybe we should lay down
some ground rules.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.707
OK, <i>perfecto. You wanna
talk pension and benefits,</i>

19:18.740 --> 19:20.976
or can we focus now?

19:21.009 --> 19:22.950
Whoa, whoa.

19:31.118 --> 19:33.155
There goes their deposit.

19:35.057 --> 19:38.161
Jesus. Looks like we just missed it.

19:45.968 --> 19:47.197
He's dead.

19:48.170 --> 19:50.133
Looks like they didn't finish feedin'.

19:54.876 --> 19:56.212
XIMENA: What is it?

19:56.244 --> 19:59.256
It's ash. It's everywhere.

20:00.281 --> 20:03.151
Usually, immolations leave
a neat little pile,

20:03.184 --> 20:07.056
but this, it's like whoever did this,

20:07.576 --> 20:08.924
made 'em explode.

20:09.416 --> 20:11.860
He didn't take kindly
to <i>La Diosa</i> either.

20:20.135 --> 20:23.204
"Shelter from the storm. The Lodge"?

20:23.956 --> 20:25.074
Never heard of it.

20:25.723 --> 20:27.408
You people gettin' religious now?

20:28.068 --> 20:29.500
You people?

20:29.525 --> 20:31.779
Sorry. I didn't mean anything by it.

20:32.184 --> 20:33.181
I'll bet.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.716
My "people" are getting massacred.

20:37.749 --> 20:39.555
Your people are running wild,

20:39.587 --> 20:41.691
- and I'm...
- (indistinct noise)

20:52.568 --> 20:54.636
(woman sobbing)

20:54.670 --> 20:58.708
He burned them. He burned them all.

20:59.708 --> 21:01.644
(crowd cheering)

21:03.878 --> 21:06.014
- What the hell are you doing?
- Buying us another shot.

21:06.048 --> 21:07.884
(Seth grunts)

21:10.218 --> 21:12.755
So, those were the Gecko Brothers.

21:12.788 --> 21:15.156
Do they always dress like undertakers?

21:15.451 --> 21:17.559
It must've been hard
for you to keep your cool.

21:17.866 --> 21:19.895
- I'm proud of you.
- If what they're saying is true,

21:19.928 --> 21:21.597
if the Xibalbans are back,

21:21.976 --> 21:24.566
we need to get ready, I need
to protect you, nothing can happen...

21:24.599 --> 21:27.200
Hey... It's OK.

21:27.868 --> 21:28.937
We'll be ready.

21:28.971 --> 21:32.074
Whatever it is, we'll handle it.

21:36.979 --> 21:38.484
You must be starving.

21:56.365 --> 21:58.099
(snarls)

22:02.203 --> 22:03.705
(slurping)

22:16.050 --> 22:17.752
(knocking on door)

22:23.191 --> 22:24.226
Something's up.

22:24.259 --> 22:27.128
(crowd cheering)

22:29.364 --> 22:31.393
He picked a fight.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.836
SANTANICO: You realize what that means?

22:33.868 --> 22:35.770
CROWD: Fight, fight, fight, fight!

22:35.804 --> 22:37.840
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

22:37.873 --> 22:40.009
What do you say we make
this interesting, huh?

22:40.689 --> 22:43.212
I'll take on your best guy,
right here, right now.

22:43.244 --> 22:44.979
I win, you come with us.

22:45.012 --> 22:47.949
I lose, we leave you alone
for the rest of your days.

22:49.885 --> 22:51.153
(chuckles)

22:51.185 --> 22:53.789
- It's a deal.
- (crowd cheering)

22:55.356 --> 22:57.960
(electronic horn blows)

23:02.329 --> 23:04.066
(Seth grunting)

23:21.849 --> 23:23.250
So, that's how you feed now...

23:24.103 --> 23:25.754
And how you gave up "the old ways".

23:26.223 --> 23:28.024
It's kinda hot, I guess.

23:29.958 --> 23:32.098
I knew you wouldn't understand.

23:36.423 --> 23:37.795
You love her.

23:38.433 --> 23:42.304
I mean, she's the reason you won't help
us track down these demons, right?

23:42.337 --> 23:45.273
I only ask 'cause there's some real
end-of-the-world shit coming.

23:45.307 --> 23:47.175
And despite your
fuck-if-I-care attitude,

23:47.209 --> 23:49.010
I know you care about your people.

23:49.043 --> 23:50.778
Imagine if they knew the truth,

23:51.451 --> 23:53.683
that you don't even
wanna fight for them.

23:56.785 --> 23:58.154
(grunts)

24:08.129 --> 24:10.031
(both grunt)

24:10.065 --> 24:12.134
- (cheering in the background)
- He was supposed to relieve Rico.

24:12.166 --> 24:14.002
Hmm. Shh.

24:22.376 --> 24:24.011
- Miguel?
- (grunts)

24:24.045 --> 24:27.249
(labored breathing)
It tried... to eat me...

24:28.884 --> 24:30.452
(click of gun being cocked)

24:40.995 --> 24:42.497
(clack of cocked gun)

24:53.308 --> 24:57.378
(low growling)

24:59.146 --> 25:00.381
(snarl)

25:00.414 --> 25:02.518
(growls)

25:05.287 --> 25:07.789
- (man screaming)
- (splashing of blood)

25:35.216 --> 25:37.819
(crowd cheering and whistling)

25:51.499 --> 25:53.649
Pack your bags, princess.

25:59.540 --> 26:02.077
(low growl)

26:07.249 --> 26:09.385
(snarling)

26:14.321 --> 26:17.058
(crowd screaming)

26:17.091 --> 26:19.227
(roaring)

26:23.543 --> 26:25.300
- (growling)
- (crowd screaming)

26:27.040 --> 26:28.876
Santanico!

26:33.880 --> 26:35.649
(snarling)

26:39.118 --> 26:42.456
(growling)

27:02.144 --> 27:04.381
- (snorting roar)
- Manola, no!

27:10.653 --> 27:13.323
SETH: What are you, nuts?

27:13.356 --> 27:15.092
Go!

27:17.693 --> 27:19.596
(beast growling)

27:24.733 --> 27:27.937
(roars)

27:31.273 --> 27:32.641
Where the hell did it go?

27:32.674 --> 27:34.077
SANTANICO: You brought
that monster here, Richard.

27:34.109 --> 27:35.978
Yeah, except it called you out.

27:36.011 --> 27:37.981
Well, what's that matter now?
Just tell me how to kill it.

27:38.013 --> 27:40.082
We can't. They're Olmecas.

27:40.115 --> 27:43.086
Legendary Xibalban warriors.
They're revered like gods.

27:43.118 --> 27:44.553
They destroy everything in their path.

27:44.586 --> 27:47.156
- So, why is it after you?
- SETH: I think I know.

27:48.129 --> 27:51.466
Kate. I saw Kate out there.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.778
- I'm sorry, what was that?
- Who's Kate?

27:53.811 --> 27:56.070
You must've taken one hell
of a shot to the head, brother.

27:56.104 --> 27:59.008
- No, I know what I saw.
- I saw her die, remember?

27:59.041 --> 28:01.530
We never found her body
at the bloodwell.

28:02.877 --> 28:04.879
<i>La Santa Sangre.</i>
It did something to her.

28:04.913 --> 28:06.944
That skull fucker, right? That last guy?

28:07.316 --> 28:09.118
He said shit that
sounded exactly like her.

28:09.150 --> 28:11.452
OK, so not only do you
think that she's alive,

28:11.485 --> 28:13.522
you think that she's siccing
these Xibalbans on us?

28:13.554 --> 28:16.524
- Well, she's got good reason to.
- Who the fuck is Kate?

28:16.558 --> 28:19.929
And how is she gonna help us get rid
of that ugly-ass beast out there?

28:19.962 --> 28:22.998
She's not. But we're gonna kill it.

28:23.031 --> 28:24.947
You just said that we can't.

28:25.333 --> 28:28.002
Seth, you and I are gonna
figure out a way to destroy it.

28:28.234 --> 28:29.840
What about us?

28:30.410 --> 28:32.240
Richard's gonna take you somewhere safe.

28:34.309 --> 28:36.110
What am I, your manny now?

28:36.144 --> 28:37.213
I won't leave you.

28:37.245 --> 28:40.248
And when it's dead...

28:40.281 --> 28:41.631
you two will leave,

28:42.317 --> 28:43.891
and never come back.

28:45.118 --> 28:47.336
CULEBRA WOMAN: <i>Nobody is safe any more.</i>

28:48.189 --> 28:51.055
Araseli. That's a pretty name.

28:52.327 --> 28:53.387
So, the man who came here

28:53.412 --> 28:55.646
was after the culebra
priest that runs this den?

28:57.299 --> 28:59.468
(breath trembling)

28:59.501 --> 29:03.629
First, they destroy our leaders.
Now they're going after our faith.

29:04.673 --> 29:07.476
(sobbing) He said <i>La Diosa</i> was a plague.

29:07.509 --> 29:10.613
<i>La Diosa...</i> will save me...

29:10.646 --> 29:12.915
No, she won't.

29:12.947 --> 29:16.185
By tonight, your queen will be dead.

29:16.217 --> 29:18.253
So, I'll ask you again.

29:18.287 --> 29:20.990
Where are the apostles gathering?

29:21.022 --> 29:23.259
They called for a meeting.

29:23.291 --> 29:28.062
(struggling to speak)
But I don't know where, I swear! (gasps)

29:28.096 --> 29:31.066
I believe you, except...

29:31.099 --> 29:33.069
(culebra grunts)

29:34.336 --> 29:36.272
I just found your heart.

29:36.304 --> 29:38.306
(culebra grunts)

29:51.086 --> 29:53.522
FREDDIE: It's OK. Just tell me...

29:54.117 --> 29:55.493
did you see where this man went?

29:56.524 --> 29:58.813
What about the meeting
with Santanico's apostles?

30:01.964 --> 30:03.655
It's OK, Araseli.

30:04.499 --> 30:05.903
Can you give us a minute?

30:15.143 --> 30:16.445
I think it was Brasa.

30:16.477 --> 30:18.513
The gang leader, from the Labyrinth?

30:18.547 --> 30:20.716
The only Xibalban I know of
who could do all this.

30:20.749 --> 30:24.553
Without the Lords, all culebras
have is their beliefs.

30:24.586 --> 30:26.588
Santanico is at the center of that.

30:26.620 --> 30:28.523
Once she's gone, they'll be lost,

30:28.557 --> 30:31.527
and the chaos
will get exponentially worse.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.628
OK. So, we find him, knock him down,

30:33.662 --> 30:35.476
and maybe the rest
will come tumbling after.

30:35.501 --> 30:36.429
Exactly.

30:36.462 --> 30:38.701
Now, all you have to do is check
your <i>rabieta</i> at the door.

30:38.733 --> 30:41.369
- My raba-what?
- Look, I get it.

30:41.403 --> 30:44.073
You think being a vampire cop
ruined your marriage.

30:44.106 --> 30:46.642
Or maybe you just blame us
for being a shitty husband.

30:46.675 --> 30:49.411
Either way, you live in that sad
apartment getting drunk every night.

30:49.444 --> 30:50.337
OK, now...

30:50.362 --> 30:52.313
And you try to deflect
every time I say it.

30:52.347 --> 30:55.184
But that girl is shellshocked,
and she needs our help.

30:55.216 --> 30:56.517
(sobbing)

30:57.177 --> 30:59.355
I know you think I'm holier than thou,

30:59.387 --> 31:03.125
but the fact is, Venganza
is hiding, culebras are dying,

31:03.157 --> 31:06.661
and these monsters are out
to destroy everything we are,

31:06.695 --> 31:08.329
and everything we believe in.

31:08.771 --> 31:10.210
We need your help.

31:11.332 --> 31:14.970
But if you're gonna be an asshole
about it, I'll do it alone.

31:15.803 --> 31:18.439
- Every other night.
- What?

31:18.473 --> 31:20.420
I get drunk every other night.

31:21.342 --> 31:22.427
One last question...

31:24.111 --> 31:26.314
Araseli, you know this place?

31:26.690 --> 31:29.018
The Lodge? I've never been,

31:29.050 --> 31:31.320
but I hear it's like
a church for <i>La Diosa.</i>

31:33.487 --> 31:35.490
SETH: Look, I know you're not
exactly thrilled to see us,

31:35.523 --> 31:37.358
but we're just trying
to save your people here, OK?

31:37.391 --> 31:39.427
- Seth, I already...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:39.461 --> 31:41.096
You're not the queen, you don't
give a shit about anybody

31:41.128 --> 31:42.464
except you and your little girlfriend.

31:42.496 --> 31:44.099
I mean, what is it
with that chick, anyway?

31:44.131 --> 31:45.433
She saved my life.

31:45.466 --> 31:48.637
(echoed roaring)

31:48.669 --> 31:51.139
Let's split up and surround it.

32:12.761 --> 32:14.495
Fuck me.

32:14.529 --> 32:16.098
(grunts)

32:21.136 --> 32:23.105
- (clink of stone chipping)
- (beast groans)

32:23.137 --> 32:25.474
(panting)

32:25.506 --> 32:26.841
(growls)

32:26.875 --> 32:29.445
Get up, Trinity.

32:29.477 --> 32:31.179
(roars)

32:31.213 --> 32:34.616
Get... up.

32:34.648 --> 32:37.418
(guttural growl)

32:37.452 --> 32:41.123
- (Seth shouts indistinctly)
- (beast roaring)

32:44.493 --> 32:46.427
MANOLA: It doesn't
feel right, leaving her.

32:46.461 --> 32:47.563
She's just trying to protect you.

32:47.596 --> 32:49.498
Just because I'm not a culebra

32:49.531 --> 32:51.366
doesn't mean that I don't know
how to take care of myself.

32:51.398 --> 32:53.702
Yeah, I'm sure things
were tough in the <i>barrio.</i>

32:53.734 --> 32:55.369
I'm from Idaho. And I'm a fighter.

32:55.403 --> 32:57.606
I went nineteen-and-oh in that pit.

33:01.576 --> 33:04.168
- So how'd you find her?
- She found me.

33:04.812 --> 33:07.306
Kisa saved me from a posse
of seven culebras

33:07.331 --> 33:09.383
who came to collect a debt.

33:09.416 --> 33:10.819
Took a lot out of her.

33:10.851 --> 33:13.773
Afterward, she needed to feed
to heal, so...

33:14.188 --> 33:15.645
I gave myself to her.

33:16.457 --> 33:18.292
So she trusts you.

33:18.326 --> 33:20.562
That's why you have to convince
her to fight with us.

33:20.595 --> 33:21.697
She's fighting now, isn't she?

33:21.730 --> 33:24.162
Except this is just the beginning.

33:24.866 --> 33:27.871
This is war, and we have
no idea what's coming next.

33:28.869 --> 33:31.670
I can tell you what comes next.

33:33.308 --> 33:34.687
Holy shit.

33:38.183 --> 33:39.985
I can't believe it's you.

33:40.017 --> 33:41.219
So this is Kate?

33:41.694 --> 33:43.839
Yeah, but how? I watched you die.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.559
(speaks in foreign language) _

33:48.260 --> 33:50.263
What the hell did you just say?

33:50.374 --> 33:52.777
_

33:52.957 --> 33:54.499
OK, Manola. I think
you need to get outta here.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.334
What, 'cause of this little
Wonderbread bitch?

33:56.368 --> 33:58.003
Nope.

33:58.035 --> 34:00.438
'Cause I don't think
this is Kate anymore.

34:02.440 --> 34:06.511
Hey, I think I figured out a way
how to kill him, all right?

34:06.544 --> 34:10.148
I hit his mask earlier, I smashed
a piece off, I think it hurt him.

34:10.181 --> 34:12.350
So I say we go for the noggin', right?
We pound on him, until...

34:12.384 --> 34:14.353
- Pound on him?
- Can I finish?

34:14.386 --> 34:16.656
- That's your plan.
- (growls)

34:18.757 --> 34:21.460
I light him up. You sneak
around behind him.

34:21.493 --> 34:24.663
We meet in the middle, squash him
like a <i>pi√±ata at a quincen...</i>

34:24.696 --> 34:26.498
<i>- quincen...
- Quincea√±era.</i>

34:27.531 --> 34:28.540
Yeah.

34:29.893 --> 34:31.103
Kate?

34:32.237 --> 34:34.039
So, it's you but...

34:34.916 --> 34:37.175
it's not you, right?
There's someone inside you.

34:37.208 --> 34:39.344
I told you to get out of the way.

34:39.377 --> 34:42.179
Hey, listen, this girl, she's got
nothing to do with any of this.

34:42.214 --> 34:43.581
This girl can speak for herself.

34:43.614 --> 34:46.027
- Manola, I told you to get outta here.
- No.

34:46.417 --> 34:47.893
Let her stay.

34:48.353 --> 34:51.190
If Santanico thinks
she can kill my warrior,

34:51.516 --> 34:54.257
I'll just turn hers
into a puddle of flesh.

34:56.495 --> 34:58.052
Get away from her.

35:33.531 --> 35:35.033
Richard!

35:35.067 --> 35:38.370
Oh, Jesus! What happened?

35:38.402 --> 35:40.339
- You were right.
- What?

35:40.371 --> 35:43.274
- She's back.
- Kate did this?

35:43.308 --> 35:45.546
It wasn't Kate.

35:56.788 --> 35:59.291
Kisa, no! It's a trap!

36:03.594 --> 36:05.363
Seth was right. You're alive.

36:05.797 --> 36:07.765
You looked taller on your balcony.

36:07.799 --> 36:11.630
Tell him to let her go, and I
promise you I will kill you.

36:12.861 --> 36:14.406
This is very disappointing?

36:15.162 --> 36:17.542
I wanted Olmeca to tear you
apart and bring me your head

36:17.576 --> 36:21.612
in front of your people, so they would
see what a real queen looks like.

36:22.476 --> 36:24.782
Kisa's the only queen
in this room, bitch.

36:24.815 --> 36:27.185
- Manola, no!
- (beast groans)

36:32.690 --> 36:34.192
Kate...

36:53.812 --> 36:55.380
(neck crackles)

37:03.654 --> 37:06.324
There it is. The Lodge.

37:10.994 --> 37:12.729
This meeting is over.

37:20.385 --> 37:23.140
Your cult is dead.

37:30.092 --> 37:31.661
Even as we speak,

37:32.517 --> 37:36.865
this is what is happening
to your serpent queen.

37:41.829 --> 37:44.706
All you've been doing
is spreading false hope.

37:45.510 --> 37:47.006
But now that you're all here,

37:47.489 --> 37:49.507
I'm going to make an example of you...

37:50.013 --> 37:54.447
prove to everyone who follows
you that there is no hope.

37:55.213 --> 37:59.318
There is only Xibalba.

38:03.521 --> 38:05.558
(rumbling)

38:17.302 --> 38:19.137
No, no, turn it off.

38:27.413 --> 38:28.947
Go that way.

38:46.632 --> 38:48.635
(gunshots)

38:50.436 --> 38:51.971
(gasps)

38:53.739 --> 38:55.407
(snarls)

39:02.681 --> 39:06.018
Peacekeeper, you're out
of your jurisdiction.

39:06.050 --> 39:07.420
I'm off duty.

39:11.991 --> 39:13.927
- I got you.
- (winces)

39:15.126 --> 39:16.501
You sure you're all right?

39:17.329 --> 39:18.664
It'll heal.

39:21.132 --> 39:24.602
So, about those new ground rules...

39:31.009 --> 39:33.014
You see that stack of flyers back there?

39:33.579 --> 39:35.390
He stopped to look at one.

39:38.617 --> 39:40.310
Well, I'll be damned!

39:46.190 --> 39:49.694
Why? Why would you kill her?

39:50.397 --> 39:51.998
It's over, Santanico.

39:52.030 --> 39:55.433
There can only be one
true queen in this realm.

39:55.467 --> 39:57.172
And that's me.

39:57.703 --> 40:00.440
And who the hell are you?

40:03.474 --> 40:05.712
Save me her head.

40:20.425 --> 40:22.194
(both growl menacingly)

41:10.442 --> 41:13.212
(monster growls)

41:13.244 --> 41:17.282
Like I said, biggest monster of 'em all.

41:24.255 --> 41:26.192
(snarls)

41:30.128 --> 41:31.630
(growls)

41:53.351 --> 41:54.752
I'm sorry.

41:55.230 --> 41:57.123
I tried to stop Kate, but I couldn't...

41:57.155 --> 41:58.458
Kate.

42:00.458 --> 42:01.687
Kate is gone...

42:03.328 --> 42:05.764
and whoever's inside of her
thinks she's some sort of queen.

42:05.797 --> 42:08.668
If she's runnin' these things,
she'll send more.

42:09.735 --> 42:11.161
So how about it?

42:13.160 --> 42:16.040
What do you say we go send
these things back to hell?

42:17.342 --> 42:19.411
There's nothing left for me here.

42:19.443 --> 42:21.547
I'll take that as a yes.

42:23.315 --> 42:24.583
Get your car.

42:37.563 --> 42:39.865
I should've stayed and fought her.

42:39.898 --> 42:41.600
You're not ready.

42:43.367 --> 42:44.624
Not yet.

42:46.237 --> 42:50.375
In the meantime, we have her
followers running scared.

42:51.610 --> 42:53.713
And as fate would have it...

42:55.346 --> 42:56.721
I found this.

42:57.549 --> 43:00.753
Scott Fuller, the girl's brother...

43:00.786 --> 43:02.544
I know who it is.

43:03.755 --> 43:07.992
I can feel her yearning
for him inside of me.

43:09.260 --> 43:10.563
Find him...

43:12.663 --> 43:14.204
and bring him to me.

43:24.242 --> 43:26.712
Now, let me tell you this...

43:36.787 --> 43:41.592
Santanico may have killed the beast...

43:51.878 --> 43:54.206
but the beast broke her.
