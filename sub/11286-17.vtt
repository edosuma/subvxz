12:09.040 --> 12:12.506
You crossed off three apple
juices from the list.

12:12.573 --> 12:15.073
The tow truck will be here
once the road's safe.

12:15.140 --> 12:17.106
Well, that could be next week.

12:17.173 --> 12:18.540
Now, you're so handy.

12:18.606 --> 12:22.473
Can't you just whip up
a little toilet up in here?

12:22.540 --> 12:24.540
Not one that would flush.

12:28.840 --> 12:32.306
‐ Hey, what's that?
‐ Oh, I think it's a snowplow.

12:32.373 --> 12:34.306
A snowplow!
Oh, we're saved.

12:34.373 --> 12:35.473
Hey, over here!

13:19.280 --> 13:22.180
You, uh, you okay?

13:22.246 --> 13:24.096
I hate the snow.

13:24.162 --> 13:27.596
And I hate being cold,
and I'm scared.

13:27.662 --> 13:29.029
Oh, Regine, look.

13:29.096 --> 13:31.829
Look, I promise I'm not gonna
let anything happen to you.

13:31.896 --> 13:35.296
Oh well, you're a little late
with the promises, Overton.

13:35.362 --> 13:37.562
You could've just driven us
straight home, right?

13:37.629 --> 13:41.096
But no! You just had to avoid
the head‐on collision.

13:42.496 --> 13:44.496
And now, look where we are.

13:46.229 --> 13:49.996
Okay, I realize that
that's just the fear talking.

13:50.062 --> 13:52.462
But baby..

13:52.529 --> 13:54.462
...don't hit me again.

13:57.896 --> 13:59.362
(Synclaire)
Okay, then. Okay.

13:59.429 --> 14:02.636

a gurgling stream.

Okay. Gurgling.

14:08.802 --> 14:11.402
Ah! Still nothin'.

14:11.469 --> 14:14.469
Come on, Max. What does it take
to get you to go?

14:14.536 --> 14:16.769
At work, I have to go
all the time.

14:16.836 --> 14:19.936
As soon as
the elevator doors close.

14:20.002 --> 14:21.936
Is there music
in the elevators?

14:22.002 --> 14:23.936
Yeah. It's sappy muzak.

Oh, crap!

14:41.402 --> 14:44.636
If she's pregnant,
it is gonna be hell on us.

14:44.702 --> 14:48.802
Dumpin' that kid off to us every
mornin' before she goes to work.

14:48.869 --> 14:49.836
You'll see.

14:49.902 --> 14:51.302
Once Max has that baby

14:51.369 --> 14:54.036
the magic of motherhood
will kick in.

14:54.102 --> 14:57.302
She may even buy
her own food.

14:57.369 --> 15:01.142
Yeah, well, I'll help Max
in any way I can.

15:01.209 --> 15:03.609
But I tell you this,
I'm not breast feedin'.

15:05.209 --> 15:07.309
Whoo, man!

15:07.376 --> 15:09.742
It is ugly out there.

15:09.809 --> 15:13.642
You know, but I did manage
to get Max her onion.

15:13.709 --> 15:16.242
And check me out.

15:16.309 --> 15:19.242
I got your dot,
your no dot.

15:19.309 --> 15:21.676
I got your plus,
your minus.

15:21.742 --> 15:23.742
And I got your pink
and your blue.

15:23.809 --> 15:25.142
Alright?

15:25.209 --> 15:28.309
I read all the instructions
just in case you need some help.

15:28.376 --> 15:30.176
Gosh, Kyle.

15:30.242 --> 15:33.242
‐ Do I sense some concern?
‐ No.

15:33.309 --> 15:36.942
Don't you wanna find out if Max
is gonna have a litter or not?

15:39.176 --> 15:40.742
Where is she anyway?

15:40.809 --> 15:42.609
Upstairs, taking my test.

15:42.676 --> 15:45.009
Don't‐don't even ask.

15:46.109 --> 15:47.409
Well?

15:47.476 --> 15:50.176
Well, nothin'. It takes
15 minutes to get the results.

15:50.242 --> 15:52.176
Is there anything
we can do, anything?

15:52.242 --> 15:54.476
Sit your butt down
and stop staring at me

15:54.542 --> 15:56.476
like my water's
about to break.

16:13.149 --> 16:15.882
Well, I know what'll take
our mind off things.

16:15.949 --> 16:17.149
Work.

16:17.216 --> 16:20.049
So, Max and Synclaire

16:20.116 --> 16:22.549
why don't you guys
sort these receipts for me?

16:22.616 --> 16:24.182
Kyle, could you tally 'em up?

16:24.249 --> 16:26.349
Mellissa, could you
proof‐read this article?

16:26.416 --> 16:28.082
That's right.

16:30.416 --> 16:32.349
Khadijah, you missed a period.

16:37.682 --> 16:39.049

16:39.116 --> 16:40.749
I'll get it.

Hello. Regine?

16:43.282 --> 16:45.649
Regine, I can hardly hear you.

16:45.716 --> 16:47.716
Any progress?

16:47.782 --> 16:50.082
Oh, not much
going on here either.

16:50.149 --> 16:53.882
Except there's a good chance
Max is pregnant.

16:53.949 --> 16:56.149
What? By who?
Wait me minute. He‐‐

16:56.216 --> 16:57.349
Hello? Hello?

16:57.416 --> 16:58.382
Oh!

16:59.349 --> 17:00.889
Battery just died!

17:00.956 --> 17:04.289
What was that all about?

17:04.356 --> 17:06.422
It's someone else's
personal business.

17:06.489 --> 17:10.321
So, I have to respect
their right to privacy.

17:10.388 --> 17:12.321
Fair enough.

17:15.289 --> 17:18.856
Well, since you're gonna
keep badgering me..

17:18.922 --> 17:20.922
It seems Max is pregnant.

17:20.989 --> 17:22.922
Oh, that's wonderful.

17:24.955 --> 17:27.222
Although I suppose
there is another way

17:27.289 --> 17:30.356
you can look at that one.

17:30.422 --> 17:34.289
Obie, this is the juiciest thing
to hit our house in a long time.

17:34.356 --> 17:37.122
You have got to
get us up outta here.

17:37.189 --> 17:39.922
Girl, without salt or sand
to put under the tires

17:39.989 --> 17:41.989
there's nothing we can do.

17:45.489 --> 17:46.456
Oh, no.

17:46.522 --> 17:48.889
Don't go there.

17:48.956 --> 17:52.122
Then, don't do it for me.
Do it for Synclaire.

17:52.189 --> 17:54.122
Huh? I mean,
she's worried about you.

17:54.189 --> 17:57.422
Sh‐she has no way of knowing
if you're alright.

17:57.489 --> 17:59.422

17:59.489 --> 18:02.062

18:02.129 --> 18:05.029
‐ Your snack cake.
‐ Mmm.

18:05.096 --> 18:09.629
Oh, you had to go
and say, "snack cake."

18:09.696 --> 18:11.629
[whispering]
Give me the knife.

18:13.062 --> 18:14.029
No.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.196
No, I'll do it myself.

18:18.262 --> 18:20.396

that way.

to check the results.

18:40.762 --> 18:44.096
I'm so nervous,
it's like I took the test.

18:44.162 --> 18:46.529
I can't wait till I'm a mother.

18:46.596 --> 18:49.096
I mean, I can and I will.
Not like Maxine.

18:51.496 --> 18:53.429
Well, I'm looking forward
to fatherhood.

18:53.496 --> 18:55.896
You know, the bonding,
the nurturing.

18:55.962 --> 18:58.296

we don't give a damn!

I like and then alienated

with my whole control thing.

19:21.569 --> 19:23.236
Well?

19:23.302 --> 19:27.436
First of all,
your Renuzit is hard.

19:27.502 --> 19:31.402
‐ Secondly, I'm not pregnant.
‐ Whoo!

19:31.469 --> 19:33.636
Oh, my gosh!

19:33.702 --> 19:35.936
Whoa! That was a close one.

19:36.002 --> 19:40.036
I mean, for a minute there, I
actually thought I was pregnant.

19:40.102 --> 19:44.036
Well, so much for
little Tyler Shaw.

19:46.369 --> 19:49.402
‐ Aww!
‐ Yeah.

19:49.469 --> 19:53.736
You know, I was actually getting
used to the idea of being a mom.

19:53.802 --> 19:57.069
Aww, that's nice, Maxine.

19:57.136 --> 19:58.836
Don't you ever..

19:58.902 --> 20:01.242
...ever put us
through that again.

20:01.309 --> 20:03.442
Hear me? Hear me?

20:03.509 --> 20:06.009
Nothing unplanned is ever
going to happen to me again.

20:06.076 --> 20:08.809
And when I do get pregnant,
oh, I'm going all out.

20:08.876 --> 20:11.676
Fertility drugs, twins,
two in one pop, tubes tied

20:11.742 --> 20:13.042
and I'm done.

20:14.409 --> 20:16.042

interesting to see

20:16.109 --> 20:17.576

you'd have.

Were we sad?

Did we‐did we talk about
other near‐pregnancies?

20:41.676 --> 20:44.409
Did we talk about what it'd
be like if we're pregnant?
