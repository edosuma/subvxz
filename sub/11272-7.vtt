00:09.301 --> 00:11.759
You got any fresh coffee? Great.

00:13.349 --> 00:16.305
Carla, l hate to criticise,

00:16.478 --> 00:21.107
but l can't believe you actually read
these sleazy scandal sheets.

00:21.277 --> 00:24.729
Look at this. Even l'm above this.

00:24.907 --> 00:28.491
''Big Foot Stole My Wife.''

00:28.661 --> 00:31.579
''Have Aliens Taken Over Your Pet?''

00:31.749 --> 00:33.790
This is garbage!

00:34.879 --> 00:37.918
For your information,
l don't read those articles.

00:38.091 --> 00:40.334
l think they're just as stupid as you do.

00:40.512 --> 00:44.642
l get it because they happen to have
a great crossword puzzle.

00:44.810 --> 00:49.639
OK, let's see. Seven across.

00:49.816 --> 00:52.058
Five-headed cow born in Vermont.

00:54.364 --> 00:56.109
Maybelle.

00:57.576 --> 01:01.530
1 6 across.
State with the most UFO babies.

01:04.001 --> 01:08.583
- Arkansas.
- l don't believe it.

01:08.759 --> 01:13.803
32 across. The aphrodisiac
found in every kitchen cabinet.

01:15.767 --> 01:17.891
l don't know what that one is.

01:18.731 --> 01:21.353
Let me see what 1 4 down is.

01:21.527 --> 01:25.361
Where Franco's brain
is being kept alive.

01:25.532 --> 01:27.739
Fish tank.

01:28.911 --> 01:33.541
OK, so, the fifth letter
of the aphrodisiac is an A.

01:33.711 --> 01:37.080
Now l remember. Oregano.

01:39.759 --> 01:41.587
Trash.

02:46.894 --> 02:49.979
Hi, sweetheart.
Don't look at me like that.

02:50.149 --> 02:52.986
l know we haven't spent
much time together,

02:53.153 --> 02:56.939
but a lot's been happening
down at Cheers. Let me grab a beer.

02:57.118 --> 03:00.651
lrene Blanchard
walks into the bar a few weeks ago.

03:00.829 --> 03:03.156
Coach falls for her like a ton of bricks.

03:03.333 --> 03:06.085
Like when we first laid eyes
on each other.

03:06.253 --> 03:11.168
He's taking her out on the town
and they've seen each other every night.

03:11.344 --> 03:15.130
So it wasn't unexpected
when Coach comes in tonight...

03:15.309 --> 03:20.055
Hey, l saw that yawn.
Well, l can finish this story tomorrow.

03:20.231 --> 03:22.984
Come on, let's you and me turn in.

03:23.152 --> 03:26.771
No! You'll wake up Vera.

03:26.950 --> 03:30.995
- Norm?
- Be right up, dear.

03:31.163 --> 03:36.752
You stupid dog. l hope she's not
in the mood to talk...or anything.

03:38.674 --> 03:44.132
- Antony, everything under control?
- You think the place would be on fire?

03:44.308 --> 03:49.100
l was worried, this being your first time
watching the kids alone.

03:49.271 --> 03:53.650
- Yeah, l know, but it was no sweat.
- That's my little man. Yuck.

03:54.738 --> 03:58.736
lt feels good to get off my feet.
Where are the kids?

03:58.910 --> 04:01.484
- Locked in the hall closet.
- Let them out!

04:01.664 --> 04:05.033
- Sure, Ma.
- l didn't say now.

04:05.211 --> 04:08.545
Would you like
another piece of pie, Cliffie?

04:08.715 --> 04:12.880
l shouldn't, but l can't resist
your gooseberry pie, Mom.

04:13.054 --> 04:18.216
Wipe your chin. That's a good boy. Did
you have a nice time tonight at Cheers?

04:18.396 --> 04:22.440
- Yeah, it was OK.
- Did you meet any young ladies?

04:22.609 --> 04:28.401
No, but there was some excitement.
l told you about the Coach and lrene?

04:28.576 --> 04:32.824
Tonight he asked her to marry him
and she said yeah.

04:32.997 --> 04:37.247
Then she gets a call from her daughter
and lrene's won the lottery.

04:37.422 --> 04:39.960
- Two million smackers.
- Good Lord.

04:40.134 --> 04:42.175
We're kind of worried, though.

04:42.345 --> 04:44.967
She forgot about
Coach when she won that dough.

04:45.139 --> 04:47.217
Maybe it'll work out.

04:47.394 --> 04:51.096
When are you taking me to Cheers
to meet your friends?

04:51.274 --> 04:53.945
- When hell freezes over.
- What?

04:54.112 --> 04:56.353
When the front seat of the car is fixed.

04:56.530 --> 04:57.906
Fine.

05:00.912 --> 05:04.828
- Hello.
- What are you wearing?

05:05.001 --> 05:07.539
- Frasier.
- l'm not Frasier.

05:07.712 --> 05:10.881
l'm not wearing anything.
Does that excite you?

05:11.051 --> 05:13.757
Frasier, l know it's you. lt's very late.

05:13.929 --> 05:17.847
- You always know it's me.
- You always do the same thing.

05:18.020 --> 05:20.094
l just called to say l love you.

05:20.271 --> 05:24.188
You're the most thoughtful boyfriend
l've ever had.

05:24.361 --> 05:26.402
That's not saying much.

05:26.572 --> 05:29.030
Speaking of Sam... This is good.

05:29.202 --> 05:32.903
The woman Coach has been seeing,
lrene, has a daughter, Sue.

05:33.081 --> 05:38.125
When they came in, Sam offered to pick
up Sue so Coach would be with lrene.

05:38.297 --> 05:41.050
But she turned him down flat.

05:41.218 --> 05:46.462
The best thing is it's been bugging Sam.
Then tonight she did it again.

05:46.641 --> 05:49.097
l hate to admit it, but l'm enjoying it.

05:49.270 --> 05:52.937
You little devil.
My dearest, l will bid you good night.

05:53.109 --> 05:57.607
By the way l really don't have any
clothes on. This phone booth is freezing.

05:57.781 --> 06:00.868
Good night, Frasier, darling.
Sweet dreams.

06:08.296 --> 06:12.628
Good Lord, aren't all the eight-year-olds
in bed by now?

06:12.802 --> 06:14.880
Good, some late news.

06:16.766 --> 06:19.685
Let's see what's on the old tube here.

06:19.854 --> 06:24.352
l watched some news over the weekend.
That's good enough, l guess.

06:27.324 --> 06:31.024
Great! l love this one! They're doctors!

06:47.308 --> 06:50.513
Found something else of yours
lying around my place.

06:53.441 --> 06:56.729
- Remember this?
- Good Lord.

06:56.905 --> 07:03.408
- For wearing or signalling aircraft?
- This is your teddy, isn't it?

07:03.581 --> 07:08.825
l don't know which of your mindless
bimbi left that in your apartment.

07:09.005 --> 07:14.214
lf she paid money for it, she should be
seen to and chemically altered.

07:14.388 --> 07:19.929
- You don't like the colour?
- What made you think that was mine?

07:20.104 --> 07:24.103
You're the only person l know that
shops at those fancy French places.

07:26.530 --> 07:29.281
The House of Ooh La La.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.859
Get it away from me. lt's horrendous.

07:36.919 --> 07:38.994
This is lovely.

07:40.714 --> 07:44.465
- Do you want it?
- Me? l can't take this, Sam.

07:44.638 --> 07:48.139
- Please, go ahead.
- God, thanks.

07:49.227 --> 07:52.644
From the House of Ooh La La!

07:52.815 --> 07:55.936
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

07:57.239 --> 07:59.231
Tell us what you know, Norm.

07:59.409 --> 08:03.657
God's in his heaven and something,
something, something.

08:03.831 --> 08:06.749
- How about a beer?
- Yeah, that's it.

08:06.919 --> 08:12.377
Your Florida tan is far deeper, far richer,
than your ordinary run-of-the-mill tan.

08:12.551 --> 08:16.681
l've got a patch over here.
l'll show you the distinction.

08:16.848 --> 08:21.144
l see Cliff found somebody he hasn't
bored to death with his Florida spiel yet.

08:21.313 --> 08:24.565
Marco Polo didn't talk
about his trip this much.

08:24.734 --> 08:28.068
- You see how the rayon sock...
- Gee, it's seven o'clock!

08:28.238 --> 08:30.481
You wonder where the evening's gone.

08:30.660 --> 08:33.697
- l'll remember where l was.
- So will l.

08:35.457 --> 08:37.533
Nice guy.

08:37.708 --> 08:41.378
- So, where's the Coach?
- He's in the back working.

08:41.549 --> 08:44.884
l understand lrene
postponed the wedding again.

08:45.053 --> 08:48.471
- What does that make? Three times.
- A Stoly rocks, Sam.

08:48.641 --> 08:52.059
He hasn't seen much of her since
she became Miss Moneybags.

08:52.231 --> 08:54.936
Woman! They're only good for one thing.

08:55.110 --> 08:57.898
And for you, not even that.

08:58.073 --> 09:01.488
l'm kind of worried.
This doesn't seem to faze Coach.

09:01.660 --> 09:04.070
He's going on like nothing happened.

09:04.247 --> 09:08.577
- lt's like he's got his head in the sand.
- Did my fiancÃ©e call, Sam?

09:08.753 --> 09:13.001
- No, Coach, not today.
- When she does, l'll be in the back.

09:13.176 --> 09:15.798
Hey, Coach, wait a second here.

09:15.973 --> 09:18.179
Let me have a little talk with you.

09:19.601 --> 09:22.224
Everything's all right with you and lrene?

09:22.397 --> 09:24.557
Yeah, sure, never better.

09:24.734 --> 09:28.186
l hear she changed the wedding date
again. What's the story?

09:28.363 --> 09:34.036
- lt's just nerves, Sam. lt's only natural.
- But you've hardly seen her lately.

09:34.206 --> 09:38.537
Well, she's been making all these
wedding plans. l'm not worried about it.

09:38.710 --> 09:42.046
Coach, she moved
and she didn't tell you where.

09:43.384 --> 09:45.877
Well, l am a little worried about that,

09:46.054 --> 09:48.973
but with all the excitement,
she probably forgot.

09:49.142 --> 09:51.301
Coach, listen to me.

09:51.480 --> 09:55.182
l'm going to tell you straight
and you'd better listen to me.

09:55.360 --> 09:59.738
Before you do, could l ask
a very special favour of you?

09:59.908 --> 10:03.075
- What?
- Would you please be my best man?

10:05.957 --> 10:10.420
Coach, sure. l'd be proud to.

10:10.589 --> 10:13.295
Thanks, Sam.

10:13.468 --> 10:15.961
Now if l can just clear this with lrene.

10:16.139 --> 10:20.801
- What does she care?
- No, it's not lrene. lt's Sue.

10:20.977 --> 10:25.975
lf you showed up at the wedding, she
said something about hiring a sniper.

10:27.070 --> 10:30.073
She can't stop thinking about me.

10:30.240 --> 10:34.785
Obviously, little Miss Sue
has a bad case of Sammy-itis.

10:34.955 --> 10:38.493
Sometimes known as the swine flu.

10:40.880 --> 10:46.553
Sam, admit it. The poor woman had
a low threshold for overbearing bores.

10:46.722 --> 10:51.966
l got an idea. Maybe l could send her
a relief map of my body.

10:52.147 --> 10:56.395
Or you could send her
a life-sized portrait of your brain.

10:56.569 --> 10:59.191
l know a good miniaturist.

10:59.364 --> 11:01.606
No, that's not sexy enough.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.619
Hi, everyone.

11:08.126 --> 11:10.334
ls Ernie here? l'd like to talk to him.

11:10.505 --> 11:12.747
He'll be honoured
you remember his name.

11:12.924 --> 11:16.259
Carla, come on. Stay out of this.

11:16.430 --> 11:18.468
Somebody here to see you!

11:18.640 --> 11:21.013
- ls it lrene?
- Yeah, it is.

11:21.185 --> 11:26.265
l haven't seen you since proposing.
How are the wedding plans going?

11:26.443 --> 11:31.901
- That's what l want to talk about, Ernie.
- Did you want to move the date up?

11:32.075 --> 11:36.028
- Ernie, would you please sit down?
- Sure, come on.

11:39.587 --> 11:45.045
- Do you know where l was tonight?
- Probably at home, wherever that is.

11:46.178 --> 11:49.182
l went to the Governor's mansion
for dinner.

11:49.351 --> 11:51.391
Holy mackerel!

11:51.561 --> 11:54.813
l guess you didn't think l'd want to go.

11:54.982 --> 12:00.774
The point is, since l won that money,
l've been meeting new people.

12:00.949 --> 12:05.363
Experiencing new things.
And there's a lot more l still want to do.

12:05.538 --> 12:09.408
l'm talking about Paris, Monaco, London.

12:09.585 --> 12:15.460
- l'd be perfectly happy with Six Flags.
- l know you would.

12:15.636 --> 12:21.806
Ernie, this is really...
This is very hard for me.

12:25.065 --> 12:27.640
l wouldn't want to hurt you for the world,

12:27.819 --> 12:32.613
but the plain truth is l'm not the same
person l was three weeks ago.

12:32.785 --> 12:36.035
That person loved you.

12:36.247 --> 12:40.495
You're a good man,
but l've been married to a good man.

12:40.670 --> 12:47.720
l've never been obscenely wealthy.
Money changes people, Ernie.

12:47.889 --> 12:52.054
lt hasn't changed me.
l'm engaged to a very wealthy woman,

12:52.228 --> 12:56.725
but l'm still the same simple guy
l always was.

12:58.569 --> 13:02.485
Ernie, l don't think
we're engaged any more.

13:03.575 --> 13:06.034
l'm sorry.

13:09.043 --> 13:12.543
l hope you can find it
in your heart to forgive me.

13:12.714 --> 13:19.087
There's nothing to forgive.
This isn't you talking, it's the money.

13:20.725 --> 13:26.731
You've got to get this out of your system
and you'll come back to me.

13:29.278 --> 13:35.237
- l wish l could make you understand.
- Look, we set a wedding date, right?

13:35.413 --> 13:37.453
That date is still set.

13:37.624 --> 13:41.076
When that date comes,
l'll be waiting for you.

13:42.005 --> 13:44.081
Goodbye, Ernie.

13:45.342 --> 13:47.383
Have a wonderful life.

13:48.472 --> 13:50.714
You're crazy. This isn't goodbye.

13:50.891 --> 13:53.598
- Yes, it is.
- lt isn't.

13:53.771 --> 13:56.476
lt is.

14:04.869 --> 14:09.866
She's going to make one hell of a wife,
ain't she? lsn't it romantic?

14:13.465 --> 14:17.380
Yeah, that's what l like.
A nice clean break.

14:29.571 --> 14:33.439
Coach, pretty spiffy there.
What's the occasion?

14:33.618 --> 14:36.239
My wedding day. Some cologne, please.

14:36.413 --> 14:38.869
- You heard from lrene?
- Not for a while.

14:39.040 --> 14:42.662
But you're not supposed
to see the bride before the ceremony.

14:42.838 --> 14:47.218
No, but you're supposed to know
whether or not she's in the country.

14:47.386 --> 14:52.215
Sam, will you stop worrying about
every little thing, like countries?

14:52.393 --> 14:55.430
- All right.
- This is a very happy day.

14:55.606 --> 14:57.731
Folks...

14:58.986 --> 15:01.822
Folks, l have an apology to make.

15:04.620 --> 15:07.491
A lot of you
can't be invited to the wedding

15:07.664 --> 15:10.915
because it's going to be
a small private affair.

15:11.085 --> 15:15.299
- Sorry some of you had to be left out.
- Like the bride.

15:15.467 --> 15:17.592
That really hurts.

15:18.639 --> 15:20.678
Then l haven't lived in vain.

15:20.849 --> 15:26.011
Diane, l'm sorry, but you can't sing
at the wedding like you offered to.

15:27.441 --> 15:29.482
l understand.

15:29.653 --> 15:33.782
Just standing there looking geeky
will be entertainment enough.

15:33.950 --> 15:37.951
Sam, l'm going to check
on my honeymoon reservation.

15:39.375 --> 15:44.453
The Coach is headed for Dump City.
He's got his pedal to the metal.

15:44.632 --> 15:48.381
l still say
there's something touching about it.

15:48.554 --> 15:52.719
A man with that much hope and faith
in a relationship is very rare.

15:52.893 --> 15:55.682
So's the oxygen to your brain.

15:55.857 --> 16:01.017
You're not helping him saying stuff like
that. We've got to get him to face reality.

16:01.196 --> 16:05.112
Diane, you of all people
should realise how painful it is

16:05.285 --> 16:08.951
to love somebody
who doesn't love you back.

16:09.834 --> 16:12.752
Yes, your sobbing, your whimpering,

16:12.921 --> 16:16.172
your moony-eyed sighs
have not gone unnoticed.

16:16.342 --> 16:20.756
You must have dreamt that about me.
So the dreams about me continue?

16:20.932 --> 16:23.470
Still have the one about the white horse?

16:23.643 --> 16:25.887
One end of it.

16:27.984 --> 16:32.197
Sam, the day l met Frasier Crane,
l stopped looking for Mr Right.

16:32.365 --> 16:34.987
That would discourage me, too.

16:35.160 --> 16:38.280
Why don't you two hit each other
in the face or shut up?

16:38.456 --> 16:41.541
- We're trying to deal with the Coach.
- You're right.

16:41.710 --> 16:45.460
But is it wrong for a man to believe
the woman he loves will come back?

16:45.631 --> 16:48.635
Yes,
when the chances that she will are none.

16:48.804 --> 16:52.138
l'm sure if lrene knew
how strongly the Coach still felt,

16:52.309 --> 16:55.725
she'd make an effort to talk to him
and straighten him out.

16:55.897 --> 16:58.519
We don't know how
to get in touch with her.

16:58.692 --> 17:02.526
But l know how to get in touch
with her daughter, Miss Frost bottom.

17:02.698 --> 17:05.487
l'll give her a message
to pass on to her mother

17:05.662 --> 17:09.242
and she can keep a little of it for herself.

17:09.414 --> 17:11.539
A message about how
a couple of women

17:11.710 --> 17:15.497
that don't know the first thing
about being decent to folks...

17:16.467 --> 17:19.301
Hi, Babe, Sam Malone. Busy tonight?

17:19.471 --> 17:22.592
For the rest of your life.
l thought that's what you'd say,

17:22.767 --> 17:24.925
but before you hang up on me here,

17:25.105 --> 17:27.893
this doesn't have anything
to do with you.

17:28.067 --> 17:32.231
lt's about your mother and the way
she's treated the Coach. lt stinks.

17:32.406 --> 17:35.194
l don't want to say
how enraged l am over the phone,

17:35.367 --> 17:37.991
so how about dinner tonight?

17:38.163 --> 17:41.120
l knew you would say that, but listen up.

17:41.293 --> 17:44.460
l don't want to go to dinner.
l already ate.

17:48.135 --> 17:50.176
So, how about a drink?

17:50.348 --> 17:53.930
l knew you would say that, too,
but l got news. l don't drink.

17:54.101 --> 17:57.188
So who feels stupid now?

17:58.941 --> 18:00.982
You agree with me?

18:01.153 --> 18:07.656
You should be ashamed of your mother,
Sue. What's going on here?

18:07.829 --> 18:10.202
Corfu?

18:14.255 --> 18:19.548
Yeah, thanks. l'm beginning to hate
the women in that family.

18:19.721 --> 18:21.761
What is it?

18:21.932 --> 18:27.938
lrene's engaged to another man, some
hotshot foreign industrialist millionaire.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.396
Said his name was Glods or something.

18:30.570 --> 18:33.820
Stanislaw Glods? What a catch.

18:35.325 --> 18:42.492
Anyway, she's living with him in Corfu,
wherever the hell that is.

18:42.668 --> 18:45.874
Corfu. Poor man's Pensacola.

18:47.552 --> 18:50.803
- Here he comes.
- Don't anybody say anything.

18:50.972 --> 18:53.594
- Any calls?
- No, Coach.

18:53.767 --> 19:00.023
- You mean lrene didn't call?
- l don't think lrene's going to call...ever.

19:00.194 --> 19:03.443
Sam, you're so young.

19:03.614 --> 19:08.243
Hey, Coach,
she's engaged to another man.

19:08.413 --> 19:11.533
l just spoke to her daughter.
Some rich European guy.

19:11.709 --> 19:17.749
Heavens to Betsy! l've been left
at the altar! What shall l do?

19:17.926 --> 19:21.925
Coach, will you wake up
and smell the coffee?

19:22.099 --> 19:26.725
- Take it easy, will you?
- Coach, l'm sorry.

19:26.938 --> 19:29.726
l didn't mean to yell at you.
Forgive me.

19:29.900 --> 19:32.025
lt's OK, honey.

19:32.196 --> 19:36.943
Up until a few moments ago, l, too,
was a holdout for a happy ending.

19:37.119 --> 19:44.370
But even this seemingly incontrovertible
evidence hasn't shaken your faith a fig.

19:45.881 --> 19:49.251
- How can you be so certain?
- Right here, Diane.

19:49.426 --> 19:52.051
The heart, who knows how it works?

19:52.222 --> 19:56.851
lt's essentially an involuntary muscle,
activated by electrical impulses...

19:57.022 --> 19:59.347
Exactly! No one!

19:59.525 --> 20:01.815
lt works by feelings, Diane.

20:01.985 --> 20:06.900
All my feelings tell me that she'll be back.
You understand?

20:07.078 --> 20:10.863
She'll be back here before closing time.

20:20.095 --> 20:23.466
Nothing's sadder than a man
holding on to a dead dream.

20:23.642 --> 20:26.596
Unless it's a blonde
struggling to keep her hopes up.

20:26.770 --> 20:31.102
No, l think it's a tall ex-baseball player
who clings for...

20:41.708 --> 20:46.621
How about the three of us go out
and get something to eat, like old times?

20:46.799 --> 20:51.961
l thought l knew her.
l was so sure she'd come back today.

20:53.265 --> 20:59.270
Maybe she had a family crisis,
like her daughter fell off her broomstick.

21:01.736 --> 21:04.192
How about a pizza? You love pizza.

21:04.363 --> 21:08.281
No, l don't.
You can't crawl in bed with a pizza.

21:08.452 --> 21:12.583
Well, maybe you could,
but a pizza can't keep you warm.

21:12.749 --> 21:17.164
Maybe it could, but you can't kiss
a pizza. Your lips would get...

21:17.340 --> 21:20.093
Coach, we get the point.

21:21.179 --> 21:24.799
- You know what really hurts the most?
- What?

21:24.976 --> 21:31.943
l thought up to the last moment she'd
call. How could l have been so wrong?

21:34.154 --> 21:37.656
You wanted it to happen so badly
you never thought it wouldn't.

21:37.826 --> 21:42.123
No, Diane. l never doubted it.
l thought we'd get together.

21:42.291 --> 21:44.619
But l guess the money did change her.

21:46.046 --> 21:48.086
l guess it did.

21:49.216 --> 21:51.377
You want to know something?

21:51.554 --> 21:55.055
l'm wondering if we would have made
that good a couple.

21:55.226 --> 21:57.433
Come on, let's get some pizza.

22:03.236 --> 22:05.860
Boy, life with her sure ain't boring.

22:09.287 --> 22:11.529
Coach, don't answer that phone.

22:11.706 --> 22:16.085
We both know that it's lrene,
but why not teach her a lesson?

22:16.255 --> 22:19.672
No, Diane.
lf she was thoughtful enough to call...

22:24.474 --> 22:27.262
Look, honey, let me do the talking.

22:27.438 --> 22:30.356
lf l hear your voice,
l may change my mind.

22:30.525 --> 22:34.654
You're better off with the rich guy.
l realise that even if you don't.

22:34.822 --> 22:39.450
Now, look, we had some good times,
just take care of yourself.

22:44.544 --> 22:47.037
l hope she understands.

22:49.592 --> 22:56.013
Coach, wait a second here. Did you
actually hear her voice on the phone?

22:56.184 --> 22:59.352
l didn't have to, Sam. lt was her.

23:00.901 --> 23:06.145
- So it's all over?
- Well, it's all over for me.

23:06.324 --> 23:08.696
l still feel sorry for her.

23:15.462 --> 23:17.538
Poor kid.

23:22.762 --> 23:24.840
lt's her.
