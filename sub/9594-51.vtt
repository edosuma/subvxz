WEBVTT

00:23.491 --> 00:25.393
Titans! We've been
waiting for this

00:25.426 --> 00:27.128
all year.

00:27.161 --> 00:29.797
Tonight, is New Year's Eve!

00:35.136 --> 00:38.306
I can't wait
to get my midnight
smoochie-smoochie on!

00:38.339 --> 00:40.774
-And I may finally release

00:40.808 --> 00:43.077
the Christmas tree
back into the wild!

00:43.111 --> 00:45.779
Be free! Be free!

00:45.813 --> 00:48.249
I just wanna
see that ball drop!

00:48.282 --> 00:51.819
Oh, yeah! Tonight we're gonna
party like...

00:51.852 --> 00:53.854
-Tonight!
-Yes.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.556
Party! Whoo-hoo!

00:55.589 --> 00:57.191
What a great time!

00:57.225 --> 01:00.094
Until you ruin it again
like you did last year!

01:00.128 --> 01:01.262
My bad, bro!

01:01.295 --> 01:03.397
I shouldn't have invited
that pack of wild dogs.
I know.

01:05.266 --> 01:06.767
Fortunately, New Year's Eve

01:06.800 --> 01:09.137
is a time to wipe
the slate clean

01:09.170 --> 01:10.471
and start fresh.

01:10.504 --> 01:13.174
But only if we observe
the New Year's Eve
traditions properly.

01:13.207 --> 01:15.376
We blew it last year
and look what happened!

01:15.409 --> 01:17.211
Our year was garbage!

01:17.245 --> 01:19.147
The February!

01:19.180 --> 01:21.882
And we didn't keep any
of our New Year's resolutions!

01:21.915 --> 01:23.284
What are you talking about?

01:23.317 --> 01:25.219
I kept my resolution.

01:25.253 --> 01:27.321
Tight as a drum!

01:35.296 --> 01:36.364
I like sandwiches.

01:36.397 --> 01:37.698
And ice cream. Don't judge me!

01:37.731 --> 01:40.668
Tonight, we will have
the perfect celebration

01:40.701 --> 01:42.603
to ensure a happy new year.

01:42.636 --> 01:45.539
But to do it,
we're going to have to train.

01:45.573 --> 01:46.840
Raven, explain.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.576
The perfect New Year's Eve
celebration

01:48.609 --> 01:51.212
involves four traditions
we must master.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.281
The toast, the countdown,

01:53.314 --> 01:54.815
the midnight kiss and

01:54.848 --> 01:57.585
the singing of that weird song
no one knows the words to.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.720
Yo, I gots toasts for days!

01:59.753 --> 02:01.889
-Not that kind of toast!

02:01.922 --> 02:04.558
A toast is when you say
a few profound words

02:04.592 --> 02:06.594
about your friends
and the future.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.262
Cyborg, toast me.

02:08.296 --> 02:11.932
Oh, uh...
I'd like to say... Words!

02:11.965 --> 02:13.601
You are people!

02:13.634 --> 02:15.569
-Cheers!
-Unacceptable!

02:15.603 --> 02:17.338
Starfire. Toast me.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.773
As we say on Tamaran...

02:23.777 --> 02:26.347
Harmonious. But not
profound enough!

02:26.380 --> 02:27.481
Raven. Toast me.

02:27.515 --> 02:30.284
So, uh, next year
we might die!

02:30.318 --> 02:31.685
Too dark!

02:31.719 --> 02:33.621
Beast Boy. Toast me.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.424
Um... May your horse
not pee-pee on your shoe

02:36.457 --> 02:38.759
and the devil not look at you
in the coming year.

02:38.792 --> 02:39.927
What does that even mean?

02:39.960 --> 02:41.495
-Ow!
-Moving on!

02:41.529 --> 02:43.764
Let's try the countdown.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.433
Who can't
count backwards?

02:45.466 --> 02:48.369
What? There's something
called counting backwards?

02:48.402 --> 02:51.772
You know, Beastie,
you start at 10
and you go to one.

02:51.805 --> 02:54.642
No, I don't know!
I don't know at all!

02:54.675 --> 02:56.310
I can barely count forwards!

02:56.344 --> 02:58.646
Our year is
depending on it, Beast Boy.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.481
-Now focus!
-Ahhh!

03:00.514 --> 03:02.716
Uh, okay, I got this.

03:02.750 --> 03:05.253
Ten!

03:05.286 --> 03:07.288
Nine!

03:07.321 --> 03:09.257
Eight!

03:09.290 --> 03:11.225
Seven! This isn't so hard.

03:11.259 --> 03:13.761
It took you 10 seconds
to get through four seconds!

03:13.794 --> 03:15.296
-Moving on!
-Ahhh!

03:15.329 --> 03:17.865
Next up, perfecting
the midnight kiss.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.800
Uh, what are the pens for?

03:19.833 --> 03:21.269
To draw the perfect match
on your hand

03:21.302 --> 03:22.636
for kissing practice,
obviously.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.972
Now go ahead. Don't be shy!

03:25.005 --> 03:28.342
I love a girl
with a sense of humor.

03:31.345 --> 03:32.846
Mmm-mmm.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.416
Looking good, marker mama!

03:35.449 --> 03:37.851
And you're one hot hombre.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.288
The dreamy.

03:40.321 --> 03:43.591
Ooh, nice mustache,
you little hipster!

03:46.427 --> 03:48.596
No, no, eyelashes are wrong,
erase, erase! Redraw!

03:48.629 --> 03:50.931
Yes, yes, beautiful!

03:50.964 --> 03:52.433
You almost done, bro?

03:52.466 --> 03:53.901
I'm ready to get my smooch on!

03:53.934 --> 03:56.404
Quiet! She needs
to be perfect!

03:57.738 --> 03:59.473
And, there!

03:59.507 --> 04:00.941
Oh, Robin!

04:00.974 --> 04:04.578
I do not know if I can wait
until the midnight!

04:04.612 --> 04:06.580
Of course you can't.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.516
But you must!

04:08.549 --> 04:11.785
Now, these kisses should be
tender and respectful,

04:11.819 --> 04:13.887
but with enough passion
to kindle the flames

04:13.921 --> 04:15.456
of a long life together.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.024
Titans, kiss!

04:21.929 --> 04:24.465
I've waited a long time
for this moment.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.400
Oh, Robin!

04:26.434 --> 04:27.801
What is that foul odor?

04:27.835 --> 04:29.637
What? Oh, no, no!

04:29.670 --> 04:31.805
I had fish and onions
for dinner!

04:31.839 --> 04:33.874
I am sorry, but I cannot kiss

04:33.907 --> 04:35.376
the onion-fish mouth!

04:35.409 --> 04:37.745
Why

04:37.778 --> 04:40.047
Why am I always
sabotaging myself?

04:43.484 --> 04:45.619
I'll, uh...
Work on it.

04:45.653 --> 04:48.889
Moving on. The singing of
that weird song no one
knows the words to.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.991
Okay, Titans. Sing.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.861
(SINGING AULD LANG SYNE
TIMIDLY)

04:58.699 --> 04:59.900
That's not how the song goes!

04:59.933 --> 05:01.869
No one knows the words, dude!

05:01.902 --> 05:04.071
Well, I do. Now,
sit back and listen

05:04.104 --> 05:05.806
to these bittersweet lyrics.

05:44.445 --> 05:45.513
Wow.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.114
I like our version better.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.453
I think we're ready.

05:52.486 --> 05:53.954
Let's take a practice run.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.823
Cyborg, toast!

05:55.856 --> 05:58.426
As I look around this room,
I see a shared past,

05:58.459 --> 06:00.394
a wonderful present
and a bright future.

06:00.428 --> 06:02.563
We are more than friends,
we are family.

06:02.596 --> 06:03.664
To the Teen Titians.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.466
May our bonds grow stronger

06:05.499 --> 06:06.567
as we grow older.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.436
Long winded, but sweet.

06:08.469 --> 06:09.737
Beast Boy! Countdown.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.875
Ah! I'm moonwalking
with numbers! Yo!

06:14.908 --> 06:17.578
Starfire. The midnight kiss.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.581
I wish I was your hand.

06:20.614 --> 06:21.849
Raven. Song.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.720
Great! I think
those are the lyrics.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.456
Titans! To the countdown!

06:42.570 --> 06:45.005
Yo, I can't wait for this
terrible year to be over

06:45.038 --> 06:46.507
so I can get a good one going.

06:46.540 --> 06:49.543
I am actually looking forward
to the February.

06:49.577 --> 06:52.546
For the first time,
our future is looking bright!

06:53.647 --> 06:55.015
It's almost midnight, Titans!

06:55.048 --> 06:57.618
Let's ring in the new year!

06:57.651 --> 06:59.953
I got this! Uh, ten...

07:01.589 --> 07:03.491
-Ten...
-Not yet, Beast Boy!

07:03.524 --> 07:05.493
My toast! I have to say words!

07:05.526 --> 07:07.628
Cyborg! Beast Boy!
Keep it together!

07:07.661 --> 07:09.630
Uh, nine...

07:09.663 --> 07:11.699
Numbers, numbers!
More numbers!

07:13.934 --> 07:15.636
Am I to be the kissing now?

07:15.669 --> 07:16.904
What? Wait, no! No!

07:16.937 --> 07:18.506
-Save it for me!
-Oh, my toast!

07:18.539 --> 07:19.873
My buttery toast!

07:22.643 --> 07:24.144
The kiss! The kiss!

07:25.646 --> 07:27.615
Wrong song, Raven, wrong song!

07:40.561 --> 07:43.531
Okay, we had another bad year,

07:43.564 --> 07:45.633
but tonight is New Year's Eve!

07:45.666 --> 07:47.267
And we can turn it all around!

07:47.300 --> 07:49.069
Next year will
only get better!

07:49.102 --> 07:51.705
Oh, yeah!

07:51.739 --> 07:53.140
-Whoo-hoo!
-ROBIN: No, no!

07:53.173 --> 07:54.608
What are you doing?

08:06.654 --> 08:10.524
I have a good feeling
about this year, Titans.

08:10.558 --> 08:11.458
Give it up, Robin.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.127
We'll never break
this cycle of misery.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.829
My shoes hurt.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.598
Then maybe it's time

08:17.631 --> 08:20.834
to take things into our
liver-spotted hands

08:20.868 --> 08:23.070
and pay a visit
to those responsible

08:23.103 --> 08:26.239
for this endless cycle
of misery.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.714
There they are.

08:33.747 --> 08:36.584
The masters of time.

08:36.617 --> 08:39.587
Why have you
entered our domain, Titans?

08:39.620 --> 08:41.722
We want a good year for once.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.557
We are bummed out!

08:43.591 --> 08:46.226
Never! Watching you repeat
the same mistakes

08:46.259 --> 08:48.662
year after year
is too much fun.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.297
Good stuff. Very funny.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.601
Then you leave us no choice.

08:53.634 --> 08:54.568
Titans, go!

08:55.703 --> 08:59.006
What are you waiting for?
Come on, fight the baby!

08:59.039 --> 09:01.241
I'm not gonna fight a baby!

09:01.274 --> 09:03.811
Then fight the old man!
Just pick one!

09:03.844 --> 09:05.613
Baby! Go play!

09:13.921 --> 09:15.155
Oy vey!

09:17.224 --> 09:18.659
Respect your elders.

09:23.731 --> 09:26.600
You won't find me
so easy to defeat, Titans.

09:32.673 --> 09:33.907
Oh!

09:33.941 --> 09:36.109
Hey! I need that to stand.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.310
You can have it back...

09:37.344 --> 09:40.714
If you promise
to give us a good year.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.082
Mmm. Very well.

09:42.115 --> 09:44.351
Enjoy your year, Titans.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.622
Yes! We did it!

09:51.158 --> 09:53.794
Happy new year!
