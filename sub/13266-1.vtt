BABY DORY: Hi. I'm Dory.

00:52.387 --> 00:56.097
I suffer from short-term remembory loss.

00:56.224 --> 00:58.314
- Yes!
- That's exactly what you say!

00:59.644 --> 01:02.234
Okay, okay.
We'll pretend to be the other kids now.

- (LAUGHING)
- Do you want to play hide-and-seek?

01:09.571 --> 01:11.361
Okay. I love... Okay.

01:11.448 --> 01:13.828
We'll hide and you count and come find us.

01:13.992 --> 01:14.702
Okay, Daddy.

01:14.826 --> 01:19.826
No, not Daddy. I'm the nice fish
who wants to be your friend, okay?

01:19.998 --> 01:21.168
- Okay, Daddy.
- No.

01:21.332 --> 01:24.172
- I'm hiding.
- Now count to ten.

01:25.336 --> 01:28.006
One, two, three...

01:28.923 --> 01:31.263
Um, four...

01:31.426 --> 01:32.426

- Mommy, can I go play with them?

01:39.184 --> 01:41.564
- Dory. Dory. Dory, honey.
- Dory. Kelpcake.

01:41.686 --> 01:43.396
Undertow, sweetie.

01:44.063 --> 01:47.113
Remember, honey, we have to
stay away from the undertow.

01:47.275 --> 01:49.435
Okay, sweetheart,
what about that rhyme we learned?

01:49.611 --> 01:52.451
# We see the undertow and we say...

01:52.530 --> 01:53.490
# Let's go

01:53.615 --> 01:58.695
No. It's, "Heck no."
Okay? Let's try it again.

01:58.870 --> 02:01.580
# We see the undertow and we say...

02:01.748 --> 02:03.628
# There's the undertow!

02:03.708 --> 02:06.418
# There's the undertow
There is the undertow

02:06.586 --> 02:10.586
# Hey, you found the undertow
And we see the undertow #

02:13.718 --> 02:16.048
- Did I forget again?
- No, no. No.

02:16.137 --> 02:17.967
- No, sweetie. Don't worry about it.
- No biggie, kelpcake.

02:19.098 --> 02:24.478
What if I forget you?
(GASPS) Would you ever forget me?

02:25.188 --> 02:26.608
- (GASPS)
- Oh, kelpcake, no.

02:26.773 --> 02:31.573
We will never forget you, Dory.
And we know you'll never forget us.

BABY DORY: Hello?

03:15.321 --> 03:16.781
Hello!

03:17.699 --> 03:19.489
- Did you hear that?
- What's that? Hear what?

03:19.659 --> 03:23.199
- Stan, I just heard someone say hello.
- I didn't hear anybody say hello.

03:23.371 --> 03:26.001
I don't know, Stan.
I just heard someone say hello.

03:26.791 --> 03:30.301
There's a lot of fish here.
Anybody could have just said hello.

03:30.461 --> 03:31.631
- BABY DORY: Hello?
- There.

03:31.921 --> 03:33.131

- There. There. Right there.

- Oh.
- Hello!

- Hello? Hi.

Hi. I'm Dory. Can you please help me?

03:46.686 --> 03:49.476
Hi, Dory. Are you lost?

03:49.647 --> 03:52.107
- Yeah, where are your parents?
- Um...

03:52.191 --> 03:54.031
I can't remember.

03:54.694 --> 03:55.904
- Oh.
- Well we'll look around.

03:55.987 --> 03:57.857
Are any of these fish your parents?

Hi, I'm Dory. Can you please help me?

- I did?
- Mm-hmm.

short-term remembory loss.

- Oh, how awful.
- Short-term memory loss?

04:23.014 --> 04:25.774
Okay, you wait here for one second.
Okay, sweetie pie?

04:25.850 --> 04:27.350
- Stan. Stan. Stan.
- What? What?

04:27.518 --> 04:29.018
What do we do? The poor thing is lost!

04:29.187 --> 04:31.187
- What do you want me to do?
- We have to do something.

04:31.356 --> 04:34.186
- She can't remember a thing!
- She could come from anywhere.

04:34.359 --> 04:38.859
Wow, you are no help today.
Dory? Sweetie? How about we...

04:39.030 --> 04:41.950
She's gone.
Well, that's not good. Hey, Dory!

- Dory!
- Dory!

05:20.071 --> 05:24.031
Well, uh, funny story, but I forgot.

05:24.158 --> 05:26.078
Oh, sweetie,
do you want to come swim with us?

I've gotten all day.

I think. Uh, I can't remember.

05:48.057 --> 05:52.807
I was looking for something and I...
Okay, get it. Date night. Have fun.

05:53.771 --> 05:56.021
Well, I hope you find whatever it is
you're looking for.

05:56.190 --> 05:58.860
You and me both. Any idea what that was?

05:59.527 --> 06:00.447
I'm sorry.

06:00.570 --> 06:01.490
I'm sorry.

06:01.612 --> 06:07.622
Okay. Guess we'll hang out another
time. Don't be a stranger, Stranger.

- He's gone. He's gone.
- There, there.

06:29.307 --> 06:30.347
- No, he's gone.
- It's all right.

06:30.516 --> 06:31.806
- He's gone.
- It'll be okay.

06:31.976 --> 06:35.016
No, no, they took him away.
I have to find the boat.

06:36.314 --> 06:37.194
A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat!

06:37.356 --> 06:38.396
- You have?
- Uh-huh.

06:38.483 --> 06:40.153
It went this way! Follow me!

Ow! Ow! Ow!

07:21.651 --> 07:25.861
Dory! It's not time to get up yet.
You have to go back to bed.

07:26.030 --> 07:28.200
And remember, the anemone stings.

07:28.366 --> 07:30.616
Oh, right. Yeah. Sorry.
Back to bed, back to bed.

07:35.081 --> 07:36.541
Hey, Marlin? Ow!

07:36.707 --> 07:39.207
Back to bed! That was it.
Very simple. Bed. Back to it.

Ready to start the day.

07:47.260 --> 07:49.390
- And we were looking for something.
- Nemo.

07:49.554 --> 07:51.934
Right. I remember it
like it was yesterday.

07:52.098 --> 07:53.928
Of course, I don't really remember
yesterday all that well.

07:54.016 --> 07:55.056
(NEMO LAUGHING)

07:55.142 --> 07:58.982
Anyway, I would say the scariest
moment of the trip was the 4 sharks.

07:59.063 --> 08:00.903
NEMO: Wait, I thought there were 3 sharks.

08:01.065 --> 08:03.395
MARLIN: No. No,
there were definitely four.

08:03.568 --> 08:04.988
But last time you told it,
there were three.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.572
Son, which one of us travelled
across the entire ocean?

08:07.738 --> 08:09.278
- Nemo did.
- (YELPS)

08:09.365 --> 08:11.075
Obviously we had to cross the ocean...

08:11.242 --> 08:13.162
to find him, so you know... He went first.

08:16.831 --> 08:18.581
I guess that's true. Isn't it?

08:20.084 --> 08:23.964
Well, you made it!
You almost missed the field trip.

08:24.130 --> 08:26.590
A field trip? Ooh, I love field trips.
Where are we going?

08:26.757 --> 08:28.757
- I thought you told her.
- I did tell her!

08:28.926 --> 08:30.596
- Uh... Dory.
- Yeah.

08:30.761 --> 08:35.931
Mr Ray has too many fish
to keep an eye on today.

08:36.100 --> 08:37.100
Uh-huh.

08:37.183 --> 08:42.904
So it would be best if today
you weren't exactly with the class.

08:43.024 --> 08:44.073
Oh. Why not?

08:44.191 --> 08:47.321
Well, you know, you have problems
remembering things sometimes.

08:47.486 --> 08:49.196
That's the one thing I can remember. Yes.

08:49.322 --> 08:53.332
Okay. And sometimes it's not your fault,
but it can cause you to wander.

08:53.409 --> 08:57.499
And Mr Ray doesn't really have time
to worry about fish who wander.

08:58.372 --> 09:00.502
In other words,
he doesn't have enough help.

09:00.625 --> 09:03.125
Poor guy. You know, he's so overworked.

09:03.294 --> 09:04.714
- You understand.
- I totally understand now.

09:04.837 --> 09:05.297
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

09:05.463 --> 09:07.723
He wants me to be the teacher's assistant.

09:07.882 --> 09:09.932
Uh... No, not exactly.

09:10.051 --> 09:12.971
I am so honoured. I have never been
a teaching assistant before.

09:14.513 --> 09:16.473
Mr Ray! You got help.

09:17.224 --> 09:20.654

- Today's the day!
- Today's the day!

Our field trip to the sting ray migration.

09:28.986 --> 09:29.736
Sting ray migration.

09:29.904 --> 09:31.994
Now, does anyone know why we migrate?

09:32.698 --> 09:33.738
(COUGHS)

09:33.908 --> 09:35.198
Come on. You got to know this stuff.

09:35.368 --> 09:38.118
Migration is about going back to...

09:38.204 --> 09:39.294
- Bed!
- Yes!

09:39.372 --> 09:40.162
- No.
- No.

09:40.331 --> 09:44.341
- The sand!
- No! Migration is about going home.

09:44.502 --> 09:46.002
- Home.
- Which is where you're from.

09:46.170 --> 09:46.840
Where you're from.

09:47.004 --> 09:48.094
Can someone tell me where they're from?

09:48.214 --> 09:51.514
- I live by a giant rock.
- I live 3 coral caves away from here.

09:51.676 --> 09:53.176
My house is covered in algae.

09:53.344 --> 09:54.684
Where'd you grow up, Dory?

09:54.845 --> 09:57.845
Me? Um, I don't know.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.893

- Can I help you?

You see, I suffer from...

10:10.945 --> 10:12.525
STUDENTS: Short-term memory loss.

10:12.655 --> 10:16.275
How can you remember your family
if you have short-term memory loss?

10:16.367 --> 10:19.907
Good question. See, I can remember
some things because well...

10:20.079 --> 10:22.709
They make sense.
Like, um, I have a family.

10:22.873 --> 10:25.333
I know because I've... I must have
come from somewhere. Right?

10:25.459 --> 10:26.539
Everyone has a family.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.917
I may not remember their names
and what they look like.

10:29.088 --> 10:31.298
And I may not even be able to
ever find them again, but, um...

10:32.717 --> 10:34.637
- What were we talking about?
- Mommies and daddies.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.390
Mommies and daddies. Right.

10:36.554 --> 10:40.394
Why are we talking about
mommies and daddies? Oh. Oh!

10:40.558 --> 10:43.268
That class. Uh-oh. Why me? Okay.

10:43.436 --> 10:46.226
You guys seem a little young,
but, um, okay.

10:46.397 --> 10:49.067
You see, kids,
when two fish love each other...

10:49.233 --> 10:51.443
And we'll stop right there.

10:53.362 --> 10:56.742
Climb aboard, explorers.
I feel a migration song coming on.

to move around the sea

# Here's a scientific promise
That a fish who's Oceanodromous

# Where did everyone go? I'm by myself
Oh, there they are. I'm back

11:17.428 --> 11:20.468
# Plus or minus 4 degrees
based on solar positioning #

11:20.639 --> 11:22.309
Oh, kids stay away from the edge.

11:22.475 --> 11:24.595
Okay, you hear that? Okay, everybody
stay back from the edge. Come on.

11:24.769 --> 11:26.439
- Okay, that's too far.
- That's too far.

11:26.604 --> 11:28.524
Come on. Come on.
Get back over here. Back this way.

11:28.606 --> 11:31.776
- Now, I need everyone to listen to me.
- All right, listen up!

11:31.942 --> 11:34.452
- When the rays pass through here...
- The rays, gonna pass through.

11:34.612 --> 11:36.282
What do we have to be careful of?

11:36.447 --> 11:37.947
Everybody has to be careful of what? Hmm?

11:38.115 --> 11:40.445
- ALL: The undertow!
- MR RAY: That's right.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.164
That's right. The under... The undertow?

11:44.997 --> 11:49.127
MR RAY: Because the current created
by all the flapping is very strong.

11:49.293 --> 11:51.463
And if you're not careful,
you can get pulled into...

11:51.629 --> 11:54.669
Mr Ray! So how do the stingrays
all know where to go?

11:54.840 --> 11:56.970
That's what an instinct is, Nemo.

11:57.134 --> 12:01.314
Something deep inside you that feels
so familiar that you have to listen to it.

12:01.472 --> 12:07.232
Like a song you've always known.
And I can hear mine now!

12:07.353 --> 12:09.653
STINGRAYS: # To and fro,
our hearts know where to go

12:09.814 --> 12:12.654

22:56.293 --> 22:57.883
In Cleveland.

22:58.420 --> 23:03.180
Fish in here, go back in the ocean.
Cleveland fish, stay there forever.

23:03.592 --> 23:05.932
(GASPS) Cleveland? No!
I can't go to the Cleveland.

23:06.094 --> 23:08.934
I have to get to the Jewel of Morro Bay,
California and find my family.

23:09.097 --> 23:10.927
That's this place.
The Marine Life Institute.

23:11.057 --> 23:13.847
The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.
You're here.

23:14.644 --> 23:15.154
You mean I'm from here?

23:15.186 --> 23:17.646
(GASPS) My parents are here.
I have to get to them.

23:17.814 --> 23:19.024
So what exhibit are you from?

23:19.190 --> 23:22.150
Wait. I'm from an exhibit?
Which one? I have to get there.

23:22.319 --> 23:24.449
Hmm. That's a hard one, kid.

23:24.613 --> 23:28.783
Unless... Nah. Never work. It's too crazy.

23:28.909 --> 23:30.949
What do you mean? Just tell me.
I'm okay with crazy.

23:31.077 --> 23:34.117
You know, I could see that?
Well, there's one thing I can think of...

23:34.289 --> 23:37.209
to help you get to your family.
If I just take...

23:37.375 --> 23:39.455
Yes! Great idea. You take me to find them.

23:39.544 --> 23:40.634
Why didn't I think of that?

23:40.795 --> 23:43.665
Uh, no, no, no. If I just take your tag...

23:43.840 --> 23:47.510
I can take your place on the transport
truck then you can go back inside...

23:47.677 --> 23:50.847
and find your family.
All you have to do is give me the tag.

23:51.014 --> 23:53.064
What tag? (GASPS) There's a tag on my fin!

23:53.183 --> 23:55.643
How could you forget
you have a tag on your fin?

23:55.769 --> 23:59.689
Oh, no. I'm sorry. I...
I suffer from short-term memory loss.

24:00.523 --> 24:02.113
You don't remember
what we were talking about?

24:02.233 --> 24:04.903
Mm-mm. Not a clue.
What were we talking about?

24:05.028 --> 24:07.858
Um, you were about to give me your tag.

24:08.031 --> 24:10.161
Well, I kind of like my tag.
Why do you want it?

24:10.283 --> 24:11.203
So I can go to...

24:12.619 --> 24:14.329
So I can go to Cleveland.

24:14.496 --> 24:16.834
Cleveland? Mmm. I hear good things
about Cleveland. Why do you want to go?

24:16.957 --> 24:19.167
Because if I stay here I'm gonna get
released back to the ocean.

24:19.334 --> 24:21.504
And I have extremely
unpleasant memories of that place.

24:22.045 --> 24:23.045
(EXHALES)

24:23.171 --> 24:25.261
I just want to live in a glass box alone.

24:25.423 --> 24:28.053
That's all I want. So give me your tag!

24:28.218 --> 24:29.548
Hey, man, don't touch my tag!

24:30.887 --> 24:31.887

Look...

24:38.228 --> 24:39.808
(SLURPS)

24:39.896 --> 24:42.896
I don't work here.
It's not like I have a map of this place.

24:43.066 --> 24:44.276
(GASPS) A map! Good idea.

24:44.442 --> 24:47.492
You take me to the map, I figure out
where my parents are. Oh, boy.

24:48.446 --> 24:52.116
All right. If I get you to your family
will you give me...

24:52.242 --> 24:55.872
I don't have much. Um, I...
How about if I give you this tag?

24:56.955 --> 24:58.365
Great idea.

24:58.873 --> 25:00.333
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

25:04.629 --> 25:06.629
MARLIN: Are you absolutely
sure that's what I said?

25:06.798 --> 25:09.588
"Go wait over there and forget.
That's what you do best."

25:09.759 --> 25:10.759
- Yeah, Dad.
- I said that?

25:10.927 --> 25:12.717
You said that, Dory swam to the surface,

25:12.804 --> 25:14.104
and she got taken by some...

25:14.264 --> 25:15.394
All right, I don't want to hear
the whole story again.

25:15.557 --> 25:18.767
I was just asking about the one part
because, look, if I said that...

25:18.935 --> 25:22.765
I'm not positive I did.
It's actually a compliment because...

25:22.939 --> 25:25.939
I asked her to wait and I said,
"It's what you do best."

25:26.109 --> 25:29.109
So I... Oh, it's my fault!

25:29.279 --> 25:33.119
It's all my fault she got kidnapped
and taken into whatever this place is.

25:33.283 --> 25:34.913
What if it's a restaurant?

25:35.076 --> 25:37.406
Oy! You two! Shut it!

25:37.579 --> 25:41.419
Yeah, we're trying to sleep!
You interrupted my favourite dream!

25:41.583 --> 25:43.293
Is that the one about you
laying on this rock?

25:43.460 --> 25:45.800
- Yeah.
- Oh, that is a good one.

25:45.962 --> 25:47.632
- Oh, yeah, isn't it? Yeah.
- It's one of my favourites.

25:48.548 --> 25:49.298
- Son! Son.
- We're trying to...

25:50.133 --> 25:52.643
Those are sea lions.
They are natural predators.

25:52.802 --> 25:53.852
They could pounce at any moment.

25:54.179 --> 25:55.309
(YAWNING)

25:55.889 --> 25:57.599
Uh, they don't look very pouncy.

25:57.766 --> 25:59.306
That's what they want you to think.

25:59.476 --> 26:02.146
Just get behind me
and let me do the talking.

26:02.312 --> 26:05.732
Excuse me, we're worried
about our friend. Is that a restaurant?

26:05.815 --> 26:07.105
(LAUGHING)

26:07.192 --> 26:10.652
Mate, it's not a restaurant.
Your friend is okay.

26:10.820 --> 26:12.950
- She is?
- It's a fish hospital.

26:13.114 --> 26:17.374
Sigourney Weaver says she'll be
rescued, rehabilitated, and released.

26:17.535 --> 26:19.535
She'll be in and out in a jiff.
We should know.

26:19.704 --> 26:21.294
- Nasal parasite.
- Anaemia.

26:21.456 --> 26:23.036
All fixed up and sent on our way.

26:23.166 --> 26:25.246
Oh, thank goodness.

Sure, that's all right.
Don't you worry ab...

- Shove off, Gerald! Come on. Off! Off!

26:31.800 --> 26:35.680
- Get off! Now you know better! Off!
- Off! Off! Off! Off!

26:35.845 --> 26:40.675
Don't you worry about a thing.
That place is the Marine Life Institute.

The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.

26:43.061 --> 26:44.941
(GASPS) She was right.

26:45.021 --> 26:47.191
It looks like Dory
can do something besides forget.

26:47.357 --> 26:49.147
Thank you, Nemo. Thank you for that.

26:49.317 --> 26:51.357
So how are we gonna get inside?

26:51.486 --> 26:53.026
Wait. You want to get inside MLI?

26:53.196 --> 26:55.866
Desperately. Our friend is in there.
Lost, alone.

26:56.032 --> 26:58.202
She's scared.
She'll have no idea what to do.

26:58.368 --> 27:01.408
Oh, we know a way.

27:01.538 --> 27:02.708
You do?

27:02.831 --> 27:05.251
BOTH: Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo-roo. Ooo-roo.

- What are they doing?
- I don't know. It sounds bad.

27:09.712 --> 27:11.342
- DORY: Are we there yet?
- HANK: Sh. Keep it down!

27:11.506 --> 27:15.296
Hank, I'm so glad I found you.
It feels like... I... Destiny.

27:15.552 --> 27:18.352
For what must be the millionth time,
it's not destiny.

27:18.513 --> 27:20.773
Uh-oh. Have I said "destiny" before?
I'm sorry.

27:20.932 --> 27:23.022
I'm just so nervous
because I'm gonna meet my parents.

27:23.184 --> 27:25.404
I haven't seen them in I don't even know
how long because...

27:25.562 --> 27:27.732
- you see I suffer from short-term...
- HANK: Short-term memory loss.

27:27.897 --> 27:29.517
Look, no more talking. Okay?
I don't like talking.

27:29.691 --> 27:32.071
I don't like chatter and questions.
And, "How are you? Oh, I'm fine."

(PHONE RINGING)

27:33.278 --> 27:35.408

27:37.615 --> 27:39.615
- Hank, look, there's a map!
- Sh!

27:39.742 --> 27:42.412
The plan is you're gonna read that
and figure out where your parents live.

27:42.579 --> 27:44.409
Then I'm on the truck to Cleveland.
You got it?

27:44.581 --> 27:46.751
Got it. What was the first part again?

27:46.916 --> 27:48.206
Ugh.

27:48.334 --> 27:49.424
What? The octopus escaped again?

27:49.544 --> 27:52.134
Wow. Look at all the exhibits.

27:52.255 --> 27:54.255
How can you do this park in one day?
Seriously.

27:54.424 --> 27:55.724
- Pick one!
- Okay. Um...

27:56.759 --> 27:58.429
(GROANS) Well,
tell everyone to keep an eye out.

27:58.595 --> 28:02.215
We're supposed to be releasing
the octopus back to the ocean today.

28:04.767 --> 28:07.597
Well, of course I haven't seen him.
If I was looking I'd find him.

28:07.770 --> 28:09.690
Hank! There you are.

No! No kids. Kids grab things.

28:18.907 --> 28:20.777
And I'm not losing
another tentacle for you.

28:20.950 --> 28:23.490
You lost a tentacle?
Well then you're not an octopus,

28:23.578 --> 28:24.828
you're a septopus.

28:24.996 --> 28:26.326
I may not remember, but I can count.

have purple shells in them.

No, no, no. You don't understand.
I remember her now.

Purple shells were her favourite
and she had this adorable giggle.

And then my dad was really friendly.

And now your wacky memory's
gonna get us caught.

Of course! We talked through the pipes
when we were little.

He thinks he can't use his echolocation,
but I've overheard...

32:22.733 --> 32:24.783
the doctors talking.
There's not a thing wrong with him.

32:24.944 --> 32:26.864
Hear every word you're saying about me.

32:26.988 --> 32:28.028
What's echolocation?

32:28.197 --> 32:31.117
Bailey's head is supposed to put out
a call and the echo helps him...

32:31.284 --> 32:36.334
find objects far away.
Oh, but apparently he's still "healing."

32:36.455 --> 32:38.285
Now I know you're talking about me.

32:38.374 --> 32:40.214
- I really can't echolocate.
- Oh.

32:40.376 --> 32:42.086
I cannot have this conversation again.
I just can't.

32:42.253 --> 32:45.303
I hit my head very hard out there.
See how swollen it is!

32:45.464 --> 32:47.764
Your head is supposed to be big!
You're a beluga!

32:47.925 --> 32:49.675
Echolocation.

32:49.760 --> 32:52.310
Oh, like the world's
most powerful pair of glasses?

32:52.388 --> 32:53.558
- What?
- What are glasses?

32:53.681 --> 32:55.471
It's sort of like you go, "hoo"

32:55.558 --> 32:58.348
and then you see things.
Why do I know that?

32:58.477 --> 33:00.897
Oh. That's interesting.

33:03.566 --> 33:06.276
There you are!
Listen up, you and I are square.

33:06.444 --> 33:08.954
I took you to the map,
now give me that tag!

33:09.113 --> 33:11.163
Wait, no. I know where my parents are.
They're in the...

33:11.324 --> 33:14.164
What's it called? The place...
The soap and lotion?

33:14.327 --> 33:15.997
- BOTH: Open Ocean.
- Open Ocean!

33:16.162 --> 33:18.622
(GASPS) Open Ocean! I know where that is.

33:18.789 --> 33:21.919
That's the exhibit located right next to...
I don't care.

33:22.084 --> 33:22.924
- Easy!
- (DESTINY GASPS)

33:23.002 --> 33:25.922
If you're trying to get to the Open Ocean
exhibit go through the pipes.

33:26.088 --> 33:28.298
- HANK: Through the pipes. Great.
- Through the pipes?

33:28.466 --> 33:30.466
Yep. Take two lefts, swim straight
and you'll hit it.

33:30.635 --> 33:34.715
Oh, that's a lot of directions. That's...
Did you get that, Hank? All that?

33:34.847 --> 33:36.767
- Uh, yeah.
- Great! Let's go.

33:37.266 --> 33:40.346
I'm not going with you. I won't fit.
You have to go by yourself.

33:41.020 --> 33:42.020
Um...

33:44.106 --> 33:49.146
That's... I'm... I... See, I can't because
I'm not so good with directions.

33:49.320 --> 33:52.370
Well, that's too bad. A deal's a deal.
You wanted to find your parents?

33:52.531 --> 33:54.491
That's how you get to them.
Now give me your tag.

33:54.659 --> 33:57.499
But, Hank, I can't go in the pipes alone.
I'll forget where I'm going.

33:57.620 --> 34:00.540
- Not my problem. Tag!
- But I can't get in that way.

34:00.665 --> 34:03.665
- I'm sorry, but there's no other way.
- There's no other way. (GASPS)

34:04.543 --> 34:05.543
(GRUNTS)

34:05.628 --> 34:08.967
- There's no other way.
- Now, now. Don't panic.

34:09.130 --> 34:13.181
It's okay. Not everything in life is
easy to do. Isn't that right, Charlie?

34:13.344 --> 34:17.474
She's right. When something's
too hard, you should just give up.

34:17.639 --> 34:19.560
- Charlie!
- A joke. I'm kidding!

34:19.725 --> 34:23.344
Just a joke. A joke.
Caution, joker at work.

34:23.521 --> 34:24.811
- Joke. I got it.
- (BABY DORY LAUGHS)

34:24.981 --> 34:28.150
You see, kelpcake?
There's always another way.

34:30.194 --> 34:31.704
Thank you, Daddy.

34:32.989 --> 34:34.489
Thank you, Daddy.

34:34.572 --> 34:37.163
(GASPS) Nope. My father said
there's always another way.

34:37.243 --> 34:40.833
- What? There is no other way.
- Open Ocean. Open Ocean. Hmm...

34:40.913 --> 34:44.083
Open Ocean. I'm pretty sure
it's the building over there.

34:44.166 --> 34:47.416
That's ill-defined and roundish.
Like Bailey's head.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.545
- Wait, what?
- Always another way. There's...

34:49.714 --> 34:53.684
There! Guys, follow me.
I know how we can get to locomotion.

34:53.842 --> 34:55.183
- BOTH: Open Ocean.
- DORY: Exactly.

34:55.928 --> 34:59.518
Um, guys.
You know I can't swim over there, right?

35:00.433 --> 35:03.193
BOTH: Ooo-roo, ooo-roo, ooo-roo.

35:03.436 --> 35:05.596
MARLIN: I don't see how this
is going to get us inside.

35:05.688 --> 35:06.938
What are you even doing?

35:07.106 --> 35:08.856
We're calling her over, of course.

35:09.025 --> 35:10.775
Calling her over? Calling who over?

35:23.622 --> 35:25.082
Listen, tell her thank you.

35:25.207 --> 35:27.377
You guys have gone
above and beyond. Really.

35:27.543 --> 35:31.763
But is there a way to get in
that involves, like, swimming?

35:31.922 --> 35:33.222
Because that's really our strength.

35:33.382 --> 35:36.012
Look, your friend is going to be
in quarantine.

35:36.135 --> 35:38.045
That's where they take the sick fish.

35:38.304 --> 35:41.814

into that place is Becky.

Hi, Becky.

35:46.437 --> 35:49.267
Ow! Stop. Let's call
her Pecky because this is hurting.

35:49.440 --> 35:50.780
(CHUCKLES) I think she likes you, Dad.

35:50.941 --> 35:55.911
Becky, love? These two nice fish
need to get into quarantine.

35:56.072 --> 35:57.912
Are you free today, Rebecca darling?

35:58.032 --> 36:01.792
Becky, is... Would that work
with your schedule? Ow!

36:01.952 --> 36:03.702
She doesn't understand what I'm saying.

36:03.829 --> 36:06.419
All you have to do
is imprint with her, mate.

36:06.540 --> 36:08.170
- Imp... What?
- BOTH: Imprint.

36:08.334 --> 36:12.424
Look her in the eye and say, "ooo-roo"
and she'll be in sync with you.

36:12.588 --> 36:15.668
- Now look her in the eye.
- Yeah.

36:15.758 --> 36:19.758
(GROANS) Nemo, I think we should
devise an alternate plan.

36:19.929 --> 36:22.599
One that involves staying in the water
and someone sane.

36:22.765 --> 36:25.805
Because this bird, this bird...
This ain't the bird!

36:25.976 --> 36:28.766
That's fine, Dad. And in the meantime,
Dory will just forget us.

36:28.938 --> 36:30.818
Like you said, it's what she does best.

36:30.981 --> 36:32.611

Your tag. It's missing.
That why you're not in quarantine?

53:51.562 --> 53:52.732
- Quarantine?
- Yeah!

53:52.855 --> 53:55.975
That's where they took all
the blue tangs. Isn't that right, Bill?

53:56.150 --> 53:59.150
Yep. The blue tangs are getting
their own exhibit in Cleveland.

53:59.320 --> 54:02.490
Being shipped out on a truck
at the crack of dawn. Must be nice.

54:02.615 --> 54:04.945
What? No! No, my parents
are back in quarantine?

54:05.118 --> 54:07.868
They're being shipped to Cleveland?
But I just got here!

54:08.037 --> 54:09.707
I've got to get to them.
They don't know I'm here.

54:09.872 --> 54:12.332
Don't worry,
it's easy to get to quarantine.

54:12.500 --> 54:14.170
You can just go through the pipes, honey.

54:16.504 --> 54:19.094
Oh. Oh, I can't do that.

54:19.799 --> 54:22.299
- Why not?
- I'll forget where I'm going.

54:22.468 --> 54:25.638
And I can't be somewhere
where I have nobody to help me.

54:25.805 --> 54:28.675
- Well, then I guess you're stuck here.
- You're not helping, Bill.

54:28.850 --> 54:31.350
Just go in there if you want to.
You'll be fine.

54:35.273 --> 54:36.483
Oh, boy.

54:37.066 --> 54:40.986
Could you tell me how to get there?
Through the pipes?

54:41.154 --> 54:45.164
Sure, honey. It's two lefts
and then a right. Simple.

54:49.162 --> 54:50.662
Okay.

54:50.747 --> 54:52.747
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

54:52.874 --> 54:55.544
Two lefts and a right. I can do this.

55:13.269 --> 55:17.229
Two lefts and a right? Shoot.

55:18.441 --> 55:22.361
Left and a right. Wait.
Did I already take a left?

55:22.487 --> 55:26.867
Oh, no. It's happening. Okay, hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

55:26.991 --> 55:30.911
Which way? Where am I going?
I can't remember. Okay.

55:31.078 --> 55:32.658
Okay. I'm lost. It's too hard.
I can't remember.

55:32.747 --> 55:33.917
I'm forgetting everything.

55:34.081 --> 55:37.921
I'm gonna be stuck forever in the pipes.
The pipes! The pipe pals.

Pipe pals? Pipe pals!

55:40.755 --> 55:44.295

- Yeah, I don't know about this.

I won't let you hit anything. Wall!

I'll never learn to get around!

You better! If you can't do it in here
you'll never do it out in the ocean.

You've got to use your echolocation!

56:06.322 --> 56:07.162
You know it's broken!

56:07.323 --> 56:09.783
Just stop it, and try the "Ooh" thing
Dory talked about, will you?

56:09.909 --> 56:11.949
- But I don't think I can...
- Don't bail on me, Bailey!

just tell me, huh? Really focus!

I'm getting something! Ooh!

- You're okay!
- You found me! How did you find me?

57:54.388 --> 57:56.558
There was a crazy clam.
He wouldn't stop talking.

57:56.724 --> 57:59.894
We just slowly backed away from him
and into these pipes.

58:00.061 --> 58:01.561
And then we just started looking.

58:01.729 --> 58:04.399
DESTINY: Dory! I'm sorry!

58:04.565 --> 58:06.065
Okay, what was that?

58:06.233 --> 58:07.573
Hang on. I got to take this.

58:07.735 --> 58:10.445
It's okay! Sorry for what?

58:10.571 --> 58:12.571
What? You're okay?

58:12.740 --> 58:14.240
- Yes!
- DORY: I found Marlin and Nemo!

58:14.325 --> 58:15.325
(LAUGHS)

58:15.409 --> 58:18.119
Dad! Did you hear that?
Dory really does speak whale.

58:18.287 --> 58:19.367
I heard.

58:19.455 --> 58:22.035
It's bringing back some very bad
memories so let's get out of here.

58:22.208 --> 58:26.048
I say we go this way.
Follow me. It's time to head home!

58:26.587 --> 58:30.007
Wait, wait, wait! Um...
My parents are here.

58:30.132 --> 58:31.932
- They are?
- You found your parents?

58:32.093 --> 58:36.433
Well, not exactly. No. I mean not yet,
but, um, I know where they are.

58:36.597 --> 58:40.887
I don't know exactly how to get there,
but I know that... I'm getting help...

58:41.060 --> 58:42.770
- DESTINY: Down to quarantine.
- Quarantine.

58:42.937 --> 58:46.607
That's it! Oh, and I met
this septopus, super cranky...

58:46.774 --> 58:51.784
but secretly kind of sweet, and he
got me into the exhibit... The exhibit.

58:54.281 --> 58:55.281
Dory?

58:56.117 --> 58:58.287
Do you think my parents
will want to see me?

58:58.452 --> 59:00.792
What? Why wouldn't they want to see you?

59:01.622 --> 59:04.792
Because... I lost them?

59:05.793 --> 59:09.763
Dory, your parents are going to be
overjoyed to see you.

59:10.589 --> 59:13.629
They're going to have missed...
everything about you.

59:13.801 --> 59:16.141
- Really?
- Do you know how we found you?

59:16.303 --> 59:18.143
- Something about a clam? Or...
- No.

59:18.305 --> 59:19.135
- No, an oyster.
- No.

59:19.306 --> 59:20.346
- Mollusc?
- No.

59:20.516 --> 59:21.176
- Something?
- No.

59:21.350 --> 59:22.600
- I don't... No?
- No clam.

59:22.768 --> 59:25.478
We were having a very hard time
until Nemo thought...

59:25.646 --> 59:27.646
"What would Dory do?"

59:28.232 --> 59:29.482
Why would you say that?

59:29.650 --> 59:32.650
Because ever since I've met you,
you've shown me how to do...

59:32.820 --> 59:37.030
stuff I never dreamed of doing.
Crazy things!

59:37.867 --> 59:41.367
Outsmarting sharks and jumping jellyfish.

59:42.538 --> 59:46.828
And finding my son.
You made all that happen.

59:48.044 --> 59:52.884
Really? I didn't know you thought that.
Unless I forgot.

59:54.133 --> 59:57.343
No, you didn't forget. I never told you.

59:58.679 --> 01:00:00.349
And I'm sorry about that.

01:00:02.641 --> 01:00:08.481
But, Dory, because of who you are,
you are about to find your parents.

01:00:10.483 --> 01:00:16.033
And when you do that, you'll be home.

01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:30.042
Dad.

01:00:30.211 --> 01:00:33.261
Does this mean
we have to say goodbye to Dory?

01:00:35.174 --> 01:00:37.224
Yes, Nemo. We do.

01:04:02.798 --> 01:04:04.628
I'm all alone.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.300
- MARLIN: Dory.
- NEMO: Dory!

01:04:08.554 --> 01:04:09.974
HANK: Where's everybody else?

01:04:10.931 --> 01:04:13.431
Your orange friends are on their way
to Cleveland. Ah!

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.270
WOMAN: I found the octopus! (SCREAMS)

(GRUNTS)

01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:28.743
Mommy? Daddy?

01:04:35.289 --> 01:04:36.289
Help.

01:04:38.125 --> 01:04:42.625
No. No. No. Help. Help. Help me.

01:04:42.796 --> 01:04:48.136
Help. Help me. Please. Somebody help me!

01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:51.850
Hey, can... Help me?
Can you help me? I've lost them!

01:04:52.014 --> 01:04:55.354
- Oh. Lost who?
- I-I-I-I...

01:04:55.517 --> 01:04:58.347
Ah, sorry, honey. I can't help you
if you don't remember.

01:04:58.979 --> 01:05:00.609
Uh... (GASPS)

01:05:01.774 --> 01:05:04.864
Oh! Can you help me? I've lost... them.

01:05:05.027 --> 01:05:06.357
Uh, can you be more specific?

01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:08.778
My... My... Them! Them! Them!

01:05:09.156 --> 01:05:10.986
Um... Um...

01:05:11.325 --> 01:05:12.325
(PANTING)

01:05:12.993 --> 01:05:13.993
Oh...

01:05:15.329 --> 01:05:17.659
Help! Help!

01:05:19.166 --> 01:05:21.786
Please? They're gone!

01:05:31.136 --> 01:05:32.846
(CRYING)

01:05:36.141 --> 01:05:40.981
I've lost... I've lost everyone.
(SNIFFLES) There's nothing I can do.

01:05:43.065 --> 01:05:47.355
Shoot, I can't forget.
What was I forgetting? Something.

01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:51.235
Something important. What was it? I...

01:05:53.033 --> 01:05:56.373
What was it? It's going away.

01:05:57.204 --> 01:06:01.214
It's going away. It's going because
all I can do is forget. I just forget.

01:06:01.375 --> 01:06:05.495
And I forget.
That's what I do best. That's what I do.

01:06:06.839 --> 01:06:11.389
What do I do? What do I do?
What do I do? What do I do?

01:06:12.261 --> 01:06:13.301
(GASPS)

01:06:13.387 --> 01:06:15.057
What would Dory do?

01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:19.564
I would look around.

01:06:22.062 --> 01:06:25.902
And, um, there's just water over there.
And a lot of kelp over here.

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.570
Kelp is better. Okay.

01:06:30.446 --> 01:06:31.776
(PANTING)

01:06:34.283 --> 01:06:38.873
Okay. Now what? Lots of kelp.
It looks the same.

01:06:40.205 --> 01:06:44.585
It all looks the same,
except there's a rock... over there.

01:06:45.252 --> 01:06:50.222
And some sand this way.
I like sand. Sand is squishy.

01:06:53.802 --> 01:06:54.802
(PANTING)

01:07:05.939 --> 01:07:07.439
Oh, this isn't going anywhere.

01:07:09.568 --> 01:07:14.658
There's nothing here.
Nothing but kelp. Lots of kelp.

01:07:14.823 --> 01:07:18.953
And some shells... this way.

01:07:20.287 --> 01:07:21.617
I like shells.

01:07:25.167 --> 01:07:28.587
I like... shells.

01:07:54.947 --> 01:07:56.277
Whoa.

01:08:33.734 --> 01:08:35.314
Hello. I'm...

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:38.734
- Dory!
- Dory! You're here.

01:08:38.907 --> 01:08:40.657
- Oh, my baby!
- You're really here.

01:08:40.826 --> 01:08:41.866
- Let me look at you.
- You found us.

01:08:42.035 --> 01:08:44.194
- I'm never letting you go again.
- Oh, my missing girl, you're here.

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:45.368
- My baby!
- It's you.

01:08:45.538 --> 01:08:49.209
- Yes! Oh, absolutely!
- It's really you! Mom, you're here.

01:08:49.376 --> 01:08:52.046
- I am, I...
- And Dad, so are you.

01:08:52.129 --> 01:08:53.669
Right here, kelpcake.

01:08:57.216 --> 01:08:58.886
(CRYING) I'm so sorry.

01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:01.721
Oh, honey. Oh, honey, no. Kelpcake.

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:05.558
I know I've got a problem. I know I'm...
And I'm so sorry.

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:09.805
And all this time I've wanted to fix it
and I can't and I try. I try.

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:12.725
But my thoughts... they leave my head
and ideas change.

01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:15.029
And I'd forgotten you and I'm so sorry.

01:09:15.193 --> 01:09:20.243
Dory. Don't you dare be sorry.
Look what you did.

01:09:20.907 --> 01:09:24.077
- (SNIFFLES) What?
- You found us!

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:26.004
That's right. You found us.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:30.957
Honey, why do you think
we stayed put here all these years?

01:09:31.126 --> 01:09:34.956
Because we believed one day
you'd find us again.

01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:36.258
Exactly!

01:09:36.965 --> 01:09:39.925
But I thought you were gone.
How did you...

01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:43.060
We went into quarantine
to look for you, but you weren't there.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:46.220
And we knew you must have
gotten out through the pipes.

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:48.600
Through the pipes. That's right, sweetie.
And so we did too.

01:09:48.769 --> 01:09:52.609
And we've stayed in this spot for you
ever since.

01:09:52.773 --> 01:09:55.113
- We thought you might come back.
- We stayed and waited for you.

01:09:55.275 --> 01:09:58.275
So every day, we go out and lay out...

01:09:59.237 --> 01:10:00.317
Shells.

01:10:05.786 --> 01:10:10.616
And you found us. Oh, honey, you found us.

01:10:10.791 --> 01:10:13.291
And you know why you found us?
Because you remembered.

01:10:14.836 --> 01:10:19.756
You remembered
in your own, amazing, Dory way.

01:10:20.801 --> 01:10:22.141
(SNIFFLES)

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:25.140
I did. All by myself.

01:10:25.305 --> 01:10:30.805
Oh, honey. Really? Have you been
by yourself all these years?

01:10:30.977 --> 01:10:32.647
Oh, my poor little girl.

01:10:32.813 --> 01:10:36.483
Oh, I haven't been all by myself...
(GASPS) Marlin and Nemo!

01:10:37.609 --> 01:10:39.779
- Nobody saw where Dory went?
- ALL: No. Sorry. I didn't see anything.

01:10:39.945 --> 01:10:42.855
Seriously? That's a lot
of eyeballs doing nothing.

01:10:43.115 --> 01:10:44.695
Oh! Oh, excuse me. Can you help us?

01:10:44.866 --> 01:10:46.366
- We're looking...
- Me help you?

01:10:46.451 --> 01:10:47.451
(SNEEZES)

01:10:50.163 --> 01:10:52.003
NEMO: (GASPS) Dad, look! It's Dory.

01:10:52.124 --> 01:10:56.594
Oh, thank goodness. See, Nemo,
I knew she'd find a way... What?

01:10:56.712 --> 01:10:58.132
Hey, where's Dory? Is she with you?

01:10:58.213 --> 01:11:00.303
(GASPS) I'm sorry.

01:11:00.382 --> 01:11:03.342
I tried to hold on,
but I couldn't and I lost her.

01:11:03.468 --> 01:11:05.428
- What?
- WOMAN: All right. Let's get going.

01:11:05.554 --> 01:11:06.724
No!

01:11:06.888 --> 01:11:09.388
DORY: And then the whale swallowed us
even though I speak whale.

01:11:09.474 --> 01:11:10.434
JENNY: A whale?

01:11:10.517 --> 01:11:11.637
CHARLIE: Good thing I wasn't
there to see that.

01:11:11.727 --> 01:11:13.647
DORY: Actually Marlin never believes
I even know how to speak whale...

01:11:13.812 --> 01:11:15.692
but you know what, he always kind of
trusts me anyway.

01:11:15.856 --> 01:11:17.356
You know, I like this Marlin already.

01:11:17.524 --> 01:11:19.994
Yeah. And then somehow
we found Nemo. Or did he find me?

01:11:20.152 --> 01:11:22.572
I don't know. But, you know what,
Nemo is the sweetest.

01:11:22.738 --> 01:11:24.448
He just never gives up on me
no matter what.

01:11:24.531 --> 01:11:25.701
Um, what would Dory do?

01:11:25.866 --> 01:11:28.656
Well, we'll certainly have to thank
Marlin and Nemo when we meet them.

01:11:29.119 --> 01:11:30.119
(GRUNTS)

01:11:30.203 --> 01:11:32.373
Wait. Wait I know this place.

Hello. I'm Sigourney Weaver.

01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:37.499
- There!
- Won't you please join us?

01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:41.550
- That's the Marine Life Institute.
- Oh, you were born there.

01:11:41.715 --> 01:11:42.545
Dory, is that where your friends are?

01:11:42.716 --> 01:11:46.756
Yes! They were stuck in something.
It was going somewhere.

01:11:46.845 --> 01:11:47.965
(TRUCK ENGINE STARTS)

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:49.814
(GASPS) A truck. They're in the truck!

01:11:49.890 --> 01:11:51.890
That means I could...
Never see them again!

01:11:52.058 --> 01:11:54.098
No! No, no, no. What would Dory do?

01:11:55.061 --> 01:11:59.231
Uh, I know they're good friends of yours,
but a truck is kind of a tall order.

01:12:00.317 --> 01:12:02.567
Please! Please.
All I know is that I miss them. I... I...

01:12:02.736 --> 01:12:07.566
I really miss them. I've said that before.

01:12:09.075 --> 01:12:10.075
Um...

01:12:10.202 --> 01:12:11.242
Dory?

01:12:11.369 --> 01:12:16.079
Mom, Marlin and Nemo are more
than good friends, they're family.

01:12:16.249 --> 01:12:20.129
And I have to get them back.
See, when they found me it felt like fate.

01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:22.923
Do you know what I mean? Or... I don't...
What's another word for fate?

01:12:23.089 --> 01:12:26.179
Like destiny. (GASPS) Destiny?

- Morning, Dest...
- Sh. It's Dory. Something's wrong.

01:12:35.602 --> 01:12:38.942
(GASPS) Ooh. I got her.
She's right outside the institute.

(DESTINY GROANS)

01:12:40.732 --> 01:12:41.902
- DORY: Destiny?
- We got to jump.

01:12:42.067 --> 01:12:43.647
- Jump?
- No time to argue!

01:12:55.038 --> 01:12:56.118
- All right.
- Yes.

01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:58.789
- Here we go. One. Two.
- Yes. Yes.

01:12:58.917 --> 01:13:00.787
I can't! I can't do it!
I'll never make it out there.

most powerful pair of glasses.

I will be your eyes.

01:13:07.968 --> 01:13:10.298
You can be my eyes. But the walls!

01:13:10.428 --> 01:13:12.508
There are no walls in the ocean!

- No walls?

Okay. Okay. We got to go.
We got to stop that truck.

Oh, yes, my beautiful gift. Ooh.

Found it! The truck's merging
onto the freeway

and it's heading south. Ooh.

01:13:53.346 --> 01:13:55.636
Let's go. We are stopping that truck.

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:13.244

Yes, ma'am. Ooh.
Your friends are still on the truck.

01:14:16.536 --> 01:14:19.076
Ooh. They're headed north
towards the bridge. Ooh.

Oh, look, there's a bunch of
cute otters over there.

Oh! I see the truck. It's over there.

01:14:30.258 --> 01:14:31.928
- Okay, what would Dory do?
- I don't see how we can get on it.

01:14:32.093 --> 01:14:34.103
Oh, man, if only there was a way
to stop traffic.

Stop traffic. Stop traffic!
Everyone needs to stop.

- Quickly before I forget.

01:23:39.724 --> 01:23:40.814
Haha! Gotcha!

01:23:40.975 --> 01:23:42.935
HANK: All right, you little shrimps,
recess is over.

01:23:43.102 --> 01:23:45.272
- Aw, man.
- Ah, nobody found me!

01:23:45.438 --> 01:23:47.358
Bring it in. Time for another...

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:48.980
Don't touch me. Time for another lesson.

01:23:49.150 --> 01:23:51.650
When is Mr Ray coming back
from his migration?

01:23:51.819 --> 01:23:53.949
If he's smart he'll stay away from here
as long as he can.

01:23:54.113 --> 01:23:55.953
But until he does,
I'm your substitute teacher.

01:23:56.115 --> 01:23:58.445
Okay kids, who wants to learn
about echolocation?

01:23:58.618 --> 01:23:59.828
- CHILDREN: Boo.
- Nobody.

01:23:59.952 --> 01:24:02.252
DESTINY: Oh, come on, guys.
It's actually really cool.

01:24:02.413 --> 01:24:03.963
Okay, kelpcake. Have fun.

01:24:04.123 --> 01:24:05.793
Nice day for a swim, huh?

01:24:05.958 --> 01:24:07.788
All right. Bye Mom. Bye Dad.

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:11.510
Well, I guess we'll go back home
and brush up on the anemone.

01:24:11.672 --> 01:24:12.972
You coming, Dory?

01:24:13.132 --> 01:24:15.092
Me? Oh, I'm just going to the dropoff.

01:24:15.635 --> 01:24:18.755
Oh, okay. What? The dropoff? No!

01:24:18.846 --> 01:24:21.016
That's... That's a good idea?

01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:24.230
Yeah. I just thought
I'd go enjoy the view. Bye.

01:24:24.935 --> 01:24:27.805
The view. Well, you have a good time!

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:32.530
All by yourself. Not getting lost.

01:24:33.527 --> 01:24:35.107

01:24:44.997 --> 01:24:46.327
Oh!

01:24:46.457 --> 01:24:47.627
Huh?

01:24:51.003 --> 01:24:56.183
Oh, no, no, no. No, no.
No, no, Dory. Dory. Dory! D...

01:25:09.188 --> 01:25:11.358
- Hey, Marlin.
- Oh, hey. Hello, Dory.

01:25:11.524 --> 01:25:12.984
You all right? You look worried.

01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:16.490
No, no, no. I'm fine.
It's how I always look.

01:25:21.283 --> 01:25:22.453
What?

01:25:22.535 --> 01:25:24.115
Well, I just...

01:25:24.203 --> 01:25:25.203
(CHUCKLES)

01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:27.290
You did it.

(GASPS)

01:25:28.791 --> 01:25:31.381
- JENNY: Yay!
- You did it, kelpcake.

01:25:31.544 --> 01:25:34.054
- Yes!
- (LAUGHS) Did what?

01:25:34.213 --> 01:25:39.343
Sweetie, you just followed the shells
all the way back home.

01:25:39.468 --> 01:25:42.718
Oh, my gosh! I did? All by myself?

01:25:42.847 --> 01:25:45.177
- Yeah.
- Do you know what this means?

01:25:45.891 --> 01:25:50.351
It means you can do
whatever you put your mind to, Dory.

01:25:50.521 --> 01:25:51.561
BABY DORY: Really?

01:25:51.772 --> 01:25:53.072
(FISH LAUGHING PLAYFULLY)

01:25:53.566 --> 01:25:55.896
(GASPS) Mommy, can I go play with them?

01:25:56.569 --> 01:26:00.029

Yeah. I did it.

01:26:10.791 --> 01:26:13.421
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

01:26:18.716 --> 01:26:20.586
It really is quite a view.

01:26:24.763 --> 01:26:25.643
Yep.

01:26:27.141 --> 01:26:28.891
Unforgettable.

# Like a song of love that clings to me

# How the thought of you does things to me
