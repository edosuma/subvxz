WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:02.000
<i>previously on</i> october road...

00:02.000 --> 00:03.500
are you ok?

00:03.500 --> 00:06.300
i'm going to find the amazing
woman who saved my life.

00:06.300 --> 00:09.400
she only comes to sully's once
every six weeks to make a delivery.

00:09.400 --> 00:13.200
somewhere between the 21st and
22nd day of no phones ringing,

00:13.200 --> 00:15.800
best friend windows
considered advertising.

00:15.800 --> 00:16.500
who's that?

00:16.500 --> 00:17.600
my dad.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.200
gavin?
yeah.

00:19.200 --> 00:23.100
i have to tell ray that gavin goddard
isn't sam's real father.

00:23.100 --> 00:24.400
you're a great mom, hannah,

00:24.400 --> 00:28.100
but there is one thing that you have
never been, and that's accountable.

00:28.100 --> 00:29.700
nothing stays a secret forever.

00:31.900 --> 00:33.600
in these uncertain times,

00:33.600 --> 00:35.800
is there anything more important

00:35.800 --> 00:37.800
than having a roof over your head...

00:37.800 --> 00:39.000
and not just a roof,

00:39.000 --> 00:41.800
but a solid, sound, reliable roof?

00:44.300 --> 00:46.900
there is a way to have
that roof...

00:46.900 --> 00:49.600
what do horses and tigers have
to do with building houses?

00:49.600 --> 00:50.900
confidence.

00:50.900 --> 00:52.500
it's all about confidence.

00:52.500 --> 00:54.200
big cat said that business
has gone up,

00:54.200 --> 00:57.800
like, a zillion percent since he started
running these commercials.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.400
yeah?

00:59.400 --> 01:02.300
well, ours is gonna be much better.

01:02.300 --> 01:03.600
come here.

01:03.600 --> 01:04.900
yeah. check this out.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.600
so i've created a basic template-

01:07.600 --> 01:10.000
a sketch of what we should do.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.100
so first we start out with the windows...
mm-hmm.

01:12.100 --> 01:13.800
and then we incorporate
all of the elements-

01:13.800 --> 01:17.400
uh, rain, wind, uh, snow, sleet,

01:17.400 --> 01:20.200
and then...

01:20.200 --> 01:21.400
what is that?

01:21.400 --> 01:22.600
the asteroid.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.400
boom! boom! asteroids!

01:24.400 --> 01:25.400
asteroid?

01:25.400 --> 01:26.500
asteroid-

01:26.500 --> 01:29.300
heading for earth, cataclysmic impact...

01:29.300 --> 01:30.700
a new ice age.

01:31.900 --> 01:33.700
and this will be owen and ronnie.

01:33.700 --> 01:34.800
and-and what are they?

01:34.800 --> 01:35.600
gangsters.

01:35.600 --> 01:36.400
why gangsters?

01:36.400 --> 01:37.900
oh, it's a theme, you know?

01:37.900 --> 01:39.800
big cat had a western motif.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.400
we'll do gangsters.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.400
shooting machine guns at- at windows?

01:44.400 --> 01:45.300
i don't know, phys.

01:45.300 --> 01:47.600
it's a motif.

01:47.600 --> 01:48.400
okay. okay.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.900
so we dissolve from the gangsters to...

01:51.900 --> 01:52.700
see?

01:52.700 --> 01:55.800
we go from the ridiculous
to the sublime.

01:55.800 --> 01:56.800
i'm the sublime.

01:56.800 --> 01:59.100
yes. yes, you are, sam daniels.

02:00.500 --> 02:03.900
and, um, then we, uh,
the voice-over says,

02:03.900 --> 02:06.800
"best friend windows-protecting you from
all the elements, blah, blah, blah."

02:06.800 --> 02:09.000
okay, so how much is this gonna
cost to make?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.600
nick said not to worry about the cost,
didn't you, nick?

02:11.600 --> 02:13.900
yeah, it's all good.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.200
good work, phys.

02:17.300 --> 02:18.700
that was jenny.

02:18.700 --> 02:20.600
the, uh, the-
the beer truck driver?

02:20.600 --> 02:23.200
who saved my life from
the evil chicken bone.

02:23.200 --> 02:26.100
she's coming to town tomorrow on
her keg delivery run to sully's,

02:26.100 --> 02:29.100
and she has accepted my offer
of a gratitude lunch.

02:29.100 --> 02:31.400
well, is it a gratitude lunch or a date?

02:31.400 --> 02:35.100
i'm hopin to show my gratitude
by turning it into a date.

02:35.100 --> 02:36.300
so that's it.

02:36.300 --> 02:38.500
you and alison areactively seeing o

02:38.500 --> 02:40.800
well, i know sheis, so why shouldn't i?

02:42.000 --> 02:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:50.100 --> 02:52.700
mom? dad.

02:54.500 --> 02:54.900
hi, honey.

02:54.900 --> 02:56.700
what are you guys doing
here at the market?

02:56.700 --> 02:59.300
there are certain things we like
you to have in the house

02:59.300 --> 03:01.200
when we come for our weekend visit,

03:01.200 --> 03:04.500
so we thought we'd pick them up
now and save youhe trouble.

03:04.500 --> 03:07.100
mom, i know what you guys like.
that's why i'm here.

03:07.100 --> 03:11.500
well, you know, your father likes
these red pistachios,

03:11.500 --> 03:15.300
hearts of palm...

03:15.300 --> 03:16.300
and then i like-

03:16.300 --> 03:18.200
i know, mom.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.400
stone ground mustard.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.400
yes. good for you, honey.

03:22.400 --> 03:25.500
i heard a rumor my two favorite people
on the planet

03:25.500 --> 03:27.000
were in town to help us plan our wedding.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.100
ray.

03:28.100 --> 03:30.000
gorgeous as ever, ellen. hey, gloy.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.200
good to see you, ray.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.100
so what are we thinking for dinner?

03:33.100 --> 03:34.800
maybe i can throw these babies
on the grill?

03:34.800 --> 03:35.200
i don't know.

03:35.200 --> 03:38.800
i think mom and dad want red pistachios,
hearts of palm and stone ground mustard.

03:45.500 --> 03:52.000
the most critical component of lyrical
abstraction remains spontaneous expression.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.200
you need to shrug off inhibition,

03:54.200 --> 03:57.500
and in today's parlance, just go for it.

03:57.500 --> 04:00.000
i can so go for it.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.500
i was born to go for it.

04:01.500 --> 04:04.900
i am the poster child for "go for it."

04:04.900 --> 04:05.500
okay.

04:05.500 --> 04:06.400
go for it.

04:06.400 --> 04:07.700
okay.

04:07.700 --> 04:09.300
right. next week's assignment-

04:09.300 --> 04:10.900
i want you to find a person-

04:10.900 --> 04:13.800
a friend, a-a lover, a relative-

04:13.800 --> 04:15.900
and paint him or her in the nude.

04:22.900 --> 04:24.500
hello.

04:24.500 --> 04:29.100
yeah, one minute.
it's for you.

04:29.100 --> 04:29.800
hello.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.200
nick, larry snyder.
remember me?

04:32.200 --> 04:34.900
i used to be your accountant back
when you returned my calls.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.500
yeah. i'm sorry, larry. what's up?

04:36.500 --> 04:38.600
we've got all these vendor invoices-

04:38.600 --> 04:42.000
camera equipment, industrial fans,
lights...

04:42.000 --> 04:44.100
yeah, pay them.
i'm shooting a commercial.

04:44.100 --> 04:46.600
okay. "pay them."

04:46.600 --> 04:49.100
uh, only thing is, nick,
we can't pay them.

04:49.100 --> 04:50.400
you're broke.

04:50.400 --> 04:51.400
what do you mean, i'm broke?

04:51.400 --> 04:54.800
yep. scrapped.
oofless. melted out.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.200
how is that possible?

04:56.200 --> 04:57.500
it's a two-way street
with money, nick.

04:57.500 --> 04:58.900
you can send as much as
you like one way,

04:58.900 --> 05:01.300
as long as you got somecoming

05:01.300 --> 05:04.300
are you saying i can't afford
to shoot this commercial, larry?

05:04.300 --> 05:06.400
i'm saying you can't afford lunch.

05:20.600 --> 05:21.900
it's gonna be so cool.

05:21.900 --> 05:23.200
the gangsters are gonna shoot the guns,

05:23.200 --> 05:24.900
and i'm gonna throw the baseball.

05:24.900 --> 05:26.800
i'm sorry. what is this for again?

05:26.800 --> 05:29.700
the commercial for nick and
eddie's window shop.

05:29.700 --> 05:31.400
nick and eddie have a window shop?

05:31.400 --> 05:34.000
yes. the one they were talking about
opening when they were kids.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.200
you've been spending time
with nick garrett.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.600
we did for a while, and then we didn't,

05:38.600 --> 05:41.200
and then we had a talk,
and now maybe we will again.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.100
a talk?

05:42.100 --> 05:43.200
he's really fun.

05:43.200 --> 05:46.500
did you guys like him in the olden days
when he and ma were together?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.600
we did.

05:49.600 --> 05:53.000
we liked nick a lot in the olden days.

05:54.800 --> 05:55.800
may i get a soda?

05:55.800 --> 05:56.600
sure.

05:59.100 --> 06:01.800
i didn't even know nick garrett
was back in town. did you, ellen?

06:01.800 --> 06:02.200
i did.

06:02.200 --> 06:07.500
but i didn't know hat he was in business
with eddie and chummy with sam?

06:07.500 --> 06:09.100
what is the big deal?

06:09.100 --> 06:12.800
why is any of what nick is
doing now a big deal?

06:12.800 --> 06:14.000
well, it's a big deal, hannah,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.600
only in the way if someone threw
a hand grenade at you,

06:16.600 --> 06:19.900
and that hand grenade blew up
everything you held dear,

06:19.900 --> 06:25.700
if the hand grenade shows up
again ten years later...

06:25.700 --> 06:28.400
anything it did would be a big deal.

06:36.400 --> 06:39.600
so i'm not exactly sure
how this works.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.100
nick garrett.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.500
yeah. yeah. that's me.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.300
i've never, you know,

06:45.300 --> 06:48.100
had to apply for a loan before, so...

06:48.100 --> 06:51.500
you're "turtle on a snare drum"
nick garrett, aren't you?

06:51.500 --> 06:52.200
i am.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.700
i am a huge fan of that book.

06:54.700 --> 06:55.000
oh, yeah?

06:55.000 --> 06:58.200
i picked it up not even knowing you were
from the ridge.

06:58.200 --> 07:02.400
i can't believe nick garrett
is sitting here at my desk.

07:02.400 --> 07:03.800
asking for a loan.

07:03.800 --> 07:07.100
well, that's why i'm here.
let's make it happen.

07:07.100 --> 07:09.900
we are very amenable to our v.i.p.s.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.300
excellent.

07:11.300 --> 07:13.300
wow.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.800
these are real good.

07:16.700 --> 07:21.400
we should get some of these framed,
put them up around the place.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.000
really? you would do that?

07:24.000 --> 07:25.100
yes.

07:25.100 --> 07:27.300
i mean, look at what we have now.

07:27.300 --> 07:30.400
the art in this place is pretty much
a bunch of rock 'n' roll posters

07:30.400 --> 07:33.400
and one stuffed armadillo.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.200
yeah, i always wondered about him.

07:35.200 --> 07:38.000
oh, that's rico.
eddie won him in a card game.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.800
gotcha.

07:39.800 --> 07:44.700
so, um, about my next art project...

07:44.700 --> 07:46.100
yes?

07:48.400 --> 07:50.900
so how are we looking?

07:50.900 --> 07:52.900
what did you do to yourself?

07:52.900 --> 07:53.800
what do you mean?

07:53.800 --> 07:55.500
i mean, your credit's death.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.900
i tried talking to my manager,
and he just laughed at me.

07:58.900 --> 08:01.300
i've been making steady payments on a-

08:01.300 --> 08:03.400
on a loft in new york
for the last three years.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.700
big loft. big payments.

08:05.700 --> 08:10.300
unfortunately, honoring a lease agreement-
it doesn't impress my bosses.

08:10.300 --> 08:11.800
why don't you ask your publisher

08:11.800 --> 08:13.500
for an advance on your next book?

08:15.100 --> 08:18.800
'cause there's not another book
coming anytime soon.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.800
i thought you were a writer.

08:20.800 --> 08:26.000
yeah, well, i'm a lot of things,
"in big trouble" being one of them.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.700
hey, would it, uh, pump you up if i
asked you for an autograph?

08:29.700 --> 08:31.100
not so much.

08:35.900 --> 08:38.400
i'm not-i'm not comfortable with it-

08:38.400 --> 08:40.400
being naked. i never have been.

08:40.400 --> 08:44.300
for example, i take issue with the fact
that they call it your birthday suit,

08:44.300 --> 08:47.400
when you only really wear it
on one birthday.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.700
arguably your most important one.

08:49.700 --> 08:51.900
but still, only one,

08:51.900 --> 08:55.500
and the only one you have no choice
in picking out an ensemble for.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.700
is there somebody else you could get
to pose for you?

08:58.700 --> 09:03.900
fine. i suppose there is
someone else i could ask.

09:03.900 --> 09:05.400
yeah, i mean, um,

09:05.400 --> 09:07.300
there's that new pizza maker at the shop.

09:07.300 --> 09:08.000
that guy.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.100
rudy.
yeah.

09:09.100 --> 09:11.500
he's 22,

09:11.500 --> 09:13.200
a bodybuilder,

09:13.200 --> 09:16.800
but, you know,
that good kind of bodybuilder,

09:16.800 --> 09:20.200
not all swollen and gross.

09:20.200 --> 09:23.300
he's more lean and cut.

09:23.300 --> 09:29.700
yeah, i suppose i could ask him to pose
nude for those long hours alone in a studio.

09:29.700 --> 09:32.400
you don't think that's gonna work, do you-

09:32.400 --> 09:35.300
using rudy to make me jealous
and force me into posing?

09:35.300 --> 09:37.900
i do think it's going to work.
yep.

09:47.300 --> 09:50.800
well, what do you think?

09:50.800 --> 09:51.400
whoa.

09:51.400 --> 09:54.200
mm, well, we cut the gangsters, owen.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.300
what? why?

09:56.300 --> 09:57.800
'cause it's silly.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.300
gangsters shooting gunsat windows-

09:59.300 --> 10:01.300
that's not really the message
we're trying to send.

10:01.300 --> 10:01.700
but-

10:01.700 --> 10:04.600
owen, showbiz is tough,

10:04.600 --> 10:07.300
but the hat looks excellent-
very raffish.

10:07.300 --> 10:10.300
in fact, i think you should wear it
on your date with jenny beer truck.

10:10.300 --> 10:12.800
oh. really. you think?

10:12.800 --> 10:14.600
well, heck, yeah.
i mean, it's-

10:14.600 --> 10:18.800
it makes you look accomplished
and self-assured...

10:18.800 --> 10:22.200
semi-fancy, like a dandy.

10:22.200 --> 10:22.900
mm.

10:22.900 --> 10:25.400
a rake.
mm.

10:25.400 --> 10:26.100
beau brummell.

10:26.100 --> 10:27.600
uh, nick?

10:27.600 --> 10:28.800
i think the commander's right.

10:28.800 --> 10:32.700
it gives you a...a jaunty aplomb.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.200
oh.

10:35.700 --> 10:39.200
well, i just don't think
you've thought this through.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.200
i'm done thinking.

10:40.200 --> 10:43.100
i've been thinking
for going on 11 years now.

10:43.100 --> 10:46.300
and yet you're still willing to go
through with this adoption thing.

10:46.300 --> 10:48.100
it's important to ray,

10:48.100 --> 10:50.400
and it's important to me,
and after we explain it to sam,

10:50.400 --> 10:52.000
it will be important to him, too.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.300
despite the fact that
it could bring everything-

10:54.300 --> 10:56.700
everything that was go
and hidden to light.

10:56.700 --> 10:59.500
you see, mom, that phrase
doesn't make any sense,

10:59.500 --> 11:01.900
because anything hidden can't be good.

11:01.900 --> 11:04.600
doesn't any of this seem
patently troublesome to you?

11:04.600 --> 11:06.800
all of it seems patently
troublesome to me, mother,

11:06.800 --> 11:10.100
and it has for a long, long time.

11:10.100 --> 11:12.300
i get that you're under
a lot of pressure.

11:12.300 --> 11:14.500
we all know how you behave
under pressure.

11:14.500 --> 11:17.700
it's my job to prevent you
from screwing up again.

11:30.800 --> 11:33.000
you're doing excellent.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.100
i am very proud of you.

11:35.100 --> 11:36.400
how much longer?

11:37.300 --> 11:38.700
hey, guys.
owen.

11:38.700 --> 11:41.100
don't you dare move!
hey, uh, i need your opinion-aah! aah!

11:41.100 --> 11:44.100
aah! my eyes! my eyes!

11:44.100 --> 11:46.500
i'm a grower,
not a shower. tell him.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.200
you show just fine.
okay, everybody, stop it.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.800
phil is helping me
with an art project.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.100
what do you want, owen?

11:54.100 --> 11:57.600
a bathrobe for you.

11:57.600 --> 11:58.600
okay.
not funny.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.200
okay. okay, so i'm going
on my jenny date,

12:01.200 --> 12:03.800
and the shirt and slacks
are oldies but goodies,

12:03.800 --> 12:06.200
therefore off the table for nitpicking,

12:06.200 --> 12:09.300
but i can't decide on one thing...

12:10.500 --> 12:12.100
hat?

12:13.700 --> 12:15.200
no hat?

12:15.200 --> 12:17.100
nick says it gives me a jaunty aplomb.

12:17.100 --> 12:18.400
what do you think?

12:20.500 --> 12:22.600
so... hat?

12:24.200 --> 12:25.300
no hat?

12:26.600 --> 12:29.700
this is a deep philosophical
conundrum you've stepped into.

12:29.700 --> 12:30.500
right, so?

12:30.500 --> 12:32.200
i say "hat."
yeah!

12:32.200 --> 12:33.500
i say "no hat."

12:33.500 --> 12:36.100
oh, thanks for nothing.

12:36.100 --> 12:38.200
you skinny people are confusing.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.300
well, this is quite a production.

12:44.300 --> 12:47.100
so are you sure you want
to cancel the wind machine?

12:47.100 --> 12:48.400
yeah. i am.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.900
i-i think it's a little over the top.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.900
all right. you tell that
to the director yet?

12:52.900 --> 12:55.300
not yet. i still don't know
why we hired him.

12:55.300 --> 12:56.900
why? he almost went to film school.

12:56.900 --> 12:58.600
okay, let's get this thing painted.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.100
we can't do a screen test
until the set is painted.

13:01.100 --> 13:02.800
what? no monocle?

13:02.800 --> 13:05.000
no riding crop? no jodhpurs?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.200
i heard a rumor that the wind machine
is going away?

13:07.200 --> 13:08.400
yeah, it's true.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.200
ugh!

13:10.200 --> 13:12.300
would you be careful
with that, please?

13:16.900 --> 13:18.600
hat?

13:20.300 --> 13:21.700
no hat?

13:22.500 --> 13:23.300
hat?

13:28.300 --> 13:30.200
who are you kidding?

13:30.200 --> 13:32.700
you are the gangster of love.

13:32.700 --> 13:34.500
it is so about the hat!

13:41.300 --> 13:42.100
jenny?

13:44.300 --> 13:45.400
it's you.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.100
yeah, it's me.

13:47.100 --> 13:49.200
i remember the sweet face.

13:49.200 --> 13:53.900
well, much sweeter without puked-up
chicken wings all over it.

13:53.900 --> 13:56.200
hey.

13:59.800 --> 14:02.300
so you want to get a table?
are you hungry?

14:02.300 --> 14:03.500
ah, starving.

14:03.500 --> 14:06.300
all right. i got-i got it.

14:06.300 --> 14:08.000
thanks.
yeah.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.400
can you believe you heimliched me?

14:14.500 --> 14:17.600
for the cocktail hour,
i have lots of fun ideas.

14:17.600 --> 14:22.100
our prosciutto-infused wheat bulgar baked
in phyllo dough has been getting raves.

14:22.100 --> 14:23.400
yum.

14:23.400 --> 14:24.900
what am i tasting?

14:24.900 --> 14:27.800
i'm guessing that would be
the dash of lavender mint.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.500
lavender mint?

14:29.500 --> 14:31.600
i think it's delish.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.000
okay.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.500
it's your wedding.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.300
okay, what?

14:36.300 --> 14:39.200
if i want to screw it up with lavender
mint, you're okay with that?

14:43.000 --> 14:46.800
hold it. hold it.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.800
and...

14:48.800 --> 14:49.300
done.

14:49.300 --> 14:51.600
ugh. finally.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.400
can i see?

14:52.400 --> 14:53.600
no, no. not yet.

14:53.600 --> 14:56.600
i still have to put my sploogalies on it.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.300
you, um...

14:58.300 --> 15:00.200
your towel's...

15:00.200 --> 15:03.000
right here.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.300
i don't think i want that.

15:05.300 --> 15:06.800
do you want me get your clothes?

15:06.800 --> 15:08.200
clothes...

15:08.200 --> 15:10.200
they sound so claustrophobic...

15:10.200 --> 15:13.400
inhibiting, you know.
i mean, this-

15:13.400 --> 15:16.000
this is kinda nice...

15:16.000 --> 15:20.900
sorta lettin' my freak flag fly.

15:20.900 --> 15:22.800
it is flying.

15:22.800 --> 15:26.500
ho! i am nude airplane...

15:26.500 --> 15:30.100
that is me, yeah.

15:30.100 --> 15:33.500
i'm just a nude airplane...

15:33.500 --> 15:38.200
naked and free!

15:44.800 --> 15:47.400
the chicken paillard is wonderful.
mm-hmm. it's really good.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.900
something else to keep in mind
is presentation.

15:49.900 --> 15:53.000
we can do a traditional sitdown
where every entrée is plated.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.900
i don't really recommend a buffet,

15:54.900 --> 15:58.600
but something we've been starting to do
that's a lot of fun is family style-

15:58.600 --> 16:01.700
big portions out on lazy susans
in the middle of the table...

16:01.700 --> 16:04.100
it's more festive,
brings the table together.

16:04.100 --> 16:05.900
i never really see that.
i kind of like that.

16:05.900 --> 16:08.200
and what about it appeals to you?

16:08.200 --> 16:11.400
i didn't say it appeals to me. i said i
kinda like the idea of something different.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.600
don't get upset, sweetheart.

16:12.600 --> 16:15.000
i'm just asking the questions
that your guests will ask.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.600
i'm hoping my guests will ask
where i'm going on my honeymoon

16:17.600 --> 16:19.000
or if we plan on having children

16:19.000 --> 16:21.700
or what it was about ray that first
made me know that he was the one

16:21.700 --> 16:24.200
i really hope hey won't be asking
about lavender mint

16:24.200 --> 16:26.200
or my questionable embrace
of lazy susans.

16:26.200 --> 16:28.300
you wanted my guidance, right?

16:28.300 --> 16:29.600
i asked for your opinion.

16:29.600 --> 16:32.500
i'm sorry i don't share your
sophistication with the english language,

16:32.500 --> 16:34.100
but i don't understand the difference.

16:34.100 --> 16:35.300
of course you don't.

16:35.300 --> 16:38.100
other people consider me quite articulate,

16:38.100 --> 16:39.500
but when i'm with you,

16:39.500 --> 16:42.000
apparently i'm nothing more
than a shrill dunce.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.500
not at all.

16:43.500 --> 16:44.900
i would never peg you
as stupid, ma.

16:44.900 --> 16:47.100
you're way too crafty
at getting what you want.

16:48.400 --> 16:49.900
champagne?

16:49.900 --> 16:50.900
yes.

16:58.100 --> 17:01.300
my wife of seven years
decides she's unhappy,

17:01.300 --> 17:07.500
and she decides the best way to get over
her funk is to sleep with my best friend.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.900
i just got out of
a relationship myself.

17:09.900 --> 17:12.700
it would've been three years
next month.

17:12.700 --> 17:14.300
oh.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.200
but that's in the past, right?

17:16.200 --> 17:19.800
why should we let your wife
and my ex infect our lunch?

17:19.800 --> 17:21.400
let's talk about other things.

17:21.400 --> 17:24.099
okay. good idea.

17:24.099 --> 17:27.099
um, like what?

17:27.099 --> 17:29.500
here-ask me anything.
i'm an open book.

17:29.500 --> 17:30.800
okay. what's your middle name?

17:30.800 --> 17:32.300
you can ask me anything in the world,

17:32.300 --> 17:34.500
and you go with
"what's your middle name?"

17:34.500 --> 17:35.400
i have a theory

17:35.400 --> 17:40.000
that middle names are more indicative
than first names of a person's character.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.100
for example, owen means "well born,"

17:43.100 --> 17:44.500
but if my theory is correct,

17:44.500 --> 17:47.800
your middle name will be a better
measure of your true nature.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.600
wow. you know a lot about names.

17:50.600 --> 17:51.400
i have to.

17:51.400 --> 17:54.600
a person can't have a theory
without data to back it up.

17:54.600 --> 17:57.000
okay, um...

17:57.000 --> 17:58.300
it's dennis.

17:58.300 --> 18:00.700
you see? i-i'm right.

18:00.700 --> 18:03.400
you are most definitely a dennis.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.300
am i? why is that?

18:05.300 --> 18:08.000
"dennis," from the greek "dionysus,"

18:08.000 --> 18:09.600
the god of wine,

18:09.600 --> 18:13.700
liberator of man's spirit from the
humdrum of everyday existence.

18:13.700 --> 18:16.300
cool. i'm a liberator.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.400
so, uh, what's your middle name?

18:21.400 --> 18:25.600
joyce. it means "cheerful, merry"...

18:25.600 --> 18:28.900
hmm. jennifer joyce bristol.

18:28.900 --> 18:31.800
yeah, my parents had a taste
for alliteration.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.600
my brother was henry hubert,

18:33.600 --> 18:36.100
so clearly i got the better end
of that deal.

18:36.100 --> 18:38.500
clearly.

18:38.500 --> 18:42.200
well, i'm glad you saved my life,

18:42.200 --> 18:45.300
jennifer joyce bristol.

18:45.300 --> 18:48.100
thank you, owen dennis rowan.

18:48.100 --> 18:50.900
i'm glad i saved your life, too.

18:53.800 --> 18:54.600
nicholson.

18:54.600 --> 18:59.000
hey, prepare, my young friend,
to have your mind blown.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.500
check this out.

19:00.600 --> 19:01.400
what is this?

19:01.500 --> 19:02.400
a crane.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.300
i always wanted to work
with one of these puppies.

19:06.100 --> 19:07.900
super...
and why do we have it?

19:08.100 --> 19:09.800
for the asteroid
point of view.

19:10.300 --> 19:12.800
yeah, rooster, buddy,
here's the thing-

19:13.500 --> 19:17.200
i think we're gonna lose the
asteroid. lose the asteroid?

19:17.500 --> 19:20.800
yeah, i think it get in the way of our message.
first you deprive me of my wind machine,

19:21.100 --> 19:22.300
then you take away
the gangsters,

19:22.300 --> 19:24.300
leaving memotif-less,
but that's okay,

19:24.500 --> 19:26.400
if your goal here is
to make this commercial suck.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.700
let's just have the kid throw
a ball through a piece of glass,

19:29.800 --> 19:31.300
then we'll cut
to you and latekka,

19:31.300 --> 19:33.700
"best friend windows.
knights ridge, massachusetts.

19:33.900 --> 19:35.300
"when it comes
to fixing things right,

19:35.300 --> 19:36.600
"we're your best friends.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.100
and we can provide
lame-o commercials, too."

19:45.700 --> 19:47.600
thank you,
owen dennis rowan.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.300
that was fun,

19:50.200 --> 19:51.900
but sadly,
i have beer to deliver

19:51.900 --> 19:54.000
and miles to go
before i sleep.

19:54.500 --> 19:58.500
but i'm gonna be out
this way again tomorrow.

19:59.300 --> 20:01.500
i have an errand to run
in lowell,

20:01.700 --> 20:02.800
but are you free for lunch,

20:02.800 --> 20:05.200
or is two days in a row
too much jenny for you?

20:05.600 --> 20:06.900
"too much jenny"?

20:07.500 --> 20:09.500
as if there could ever
be such a thing.

20:10.300 --> 20:11.100
well, great,

20:11.600 --> 20:14.600
then it's a date,
and this time, it is on me.

20:17.700 --> 20:18.700
bye!

20:22.200 --> 20:24.500
so, hey, i talked to
jim at channel 5. mm-hmm.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.100
he says our best bet
is to buy ad time

20:26.100 --> 20:30.400
during the middle of the day.
whoa. what's going on, phil?

20:30.500 --> 20:33.600
hey, guys.
just cataloging my cds.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.500
yeah, it's-that's not
what i'm talking about.

20:36.500 --> 20:39.400
oh, uh, pizza girl
had to sketch a nude

20:39.400 --> 20:41.100
for her drawing class.
i was her model,

20:41.100 --> 20:43.300
and then when we were done,
it occurred to me,

20:43.800 --> 20:47.200
there wasn't really any need to
put my clothes back on. why not?

20:47.400 --> 20:50.400
well, because sometimes
i feel trapped in here...

20:50.400 --> 20:52.600
phil.
but without my clothes, it-

20:52.600 --> 20:55.000
aah. okay, so you're just
gonn naked from now on?

20:55.100 --> 20:56.000
not naked-

20:56.300 --> 20:57.900
nude.
right.

20:57.900 --> 21:01.200
"naked" implies embarrassment
and vulnerability, exposure...

21:01.200 --> 21:02.000
yeah.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.800
"nude" does not.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.800
"nude" implies
the sun on my bum,

21:07.400 --> 21:09.400
the air on my snookle.

21:10.500 --> 21:13.800
<i>"nude" implies free.</i>

21:15.700 --> 21:17.600
i'm going over here.
i'll go with you.

21:20.100 --> 21:21.400
gin.
again?

21:21.700 --> 21:24.500
hannah jane, come join us.
we need somebody we can beat,

21:24.500 --> 21:26.500
don't we, ellen?
oh, i don't think so, dad.

21:26.500 --> 21:30.500
i still need to straighten up in
here. oh, come on, mom. please?

21:30.700 --> 21:31.700
come on.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.200
okay, fine.

21:35.300 --> 21:37.300
but beware-
i take no prisoners.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.200
i'm getting kind of tired.

21:40.200 --> 21:41.800
i think i'm gonna
turn in early.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.700
come on, grandma.
one more hand?

21:44.900 --> 21:47.100
i don't think i'm gonna
be very much fun.

21:47.500 --> 21:48.700
i need to get some rest.

22:00.100 --> 22:00.900
okay.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.400
ha ha ha!
rich, how you been?

22:06.400 --> 22:08.200
very good, man.
fitzy, what goes on?

22:08.200 --> 22:11.700
hey, how you doin'? sully, draft
for me and a round for my friends.

22:12.300 --> 22:13.400
look who's skippin'
on rainbows

22:13.400 --> 22:15.500
and riding
the unicorn railroad.

22:15.700 --> 22:16.800
as i should be.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.700
as i should be
when i've just met

22:18.700 --> 22:21.100
the girl of which
my fantasies are made.

22:21.400 --> 22:22.900
the paul revere beer
delivery girl?

22:23.800 --> 22:26.400
yeah.
i've had that fantasy, too.

22:26.400 --> 22:29.100
oh, she's beautiful,
funny, charming,

22:29.100 --> 22:31.300
plus we have so much
n, it's silly.

22:31.300 --> 22:34.100
well, good luck on that,
'cause the way i hear it,

22:34.400 --> 22:36.000
one of them things
you and her have in common-

22:36.800 --> 22:38.000
<i>you both like girls.</i>

22:38.600 --> 22:40.800
ha ha ha!
what are you saying?

22:41.200 --> 22:44.600
what i'm saying is
that the girl of your dreams

22:45.600 --> 22:47.800
<i>has girls in her dreams.</i>

22:48.300 --> 22:51.500
uh-oh!
ooh!

22:54.900 --> 22:56.900
ooh.
yeah.

22:58.700 --> 22:59.700
oh, let me help you.

23:00.600 --> 23:01.400
thanks, dad.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
your mother and i
have a policy.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.900
we never go to bed angry.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.200
34 years of marriage,

23:08.200 --> 23:10.700
and we've only broken that
on a handful of occasions.

23:12.000 --> 23:12.900
dad...

23:13.400 --> 23:14.300
no.

23:15.700 --> 23:17.900
what's going on tween
you and your mother, hanna?

23:19.100 --> 23:20.900
you two used to be
thick as thieves.

23:21.700 --> 23:23.700
there were even times when
the three of us were together-

23:23.800 --> 23:25.500
i felt like an outsider.

23:28.100 --> 23:30.600
yeah, i'll admit,
it was hard for me,

23:32.500 --> 23:34.600
but seeing
es peor. two like this-ro verla

23:34.600 --> 23:35.400
it's worse.

23:38.300 --> 23:40.100
mom and i just got
into a fight, you know?

23:41.300 --> 23:42.100
it'll blow over.

23:42.700 --> 23:44.300
i'm not talking
about tonight, hannah.

23:44.700 --> 23:46.400
this has been going on
for years now.

23:46.900 --> 23:49.800
what happened between you two?
what is this about?

23:58.500 --> 23:59.600
you two should work it out.

24:00.300 --> 24:02.600
your mother and i aren't gonna
be around forever, you know.

24:02.700 --> 24:04.100
dad,
please don't say that.

24:05.100 --> 24:05.900
sorry.

24:08.600 --> 24:09.400
good night, sweetheart.

24:11.100 --> 24:11.900
dad?

24:14.900 --> 24:15.700
good night.

24:21.300 --> 24:22.300
good night, baby.

24:22.700 --> 24:23.500
okay.

24:39.400 --> 24:40.200
can i get a draft?

24:41.900 --> 24:42.800
eddie?

24:43.100 --> 24:44.000
eddie latekka.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.700
mack hill,
knights ridge mutual.

24:46.400 --> 24:48.600
also used to run the snack bar
at the little league field.

24:49.500 --> 24:51.700
oh, of course.
"refill" hill.

24:52.400 --> 24:54.200
you were very generous
at the soda fountain.

24:54.600 --> 24:55.400
that i was.

24:55.800 --> 24:56.600
funny running into you

24:56.600 --> 25:00.500
and nick garrett in the same
week. really? where'd you see nick?

25:07.200 --> 25:08.000
what are you doing?

25:08.200 --> 25:09.200
well, i just thought

25:09.200 --> 25:10.900
that since clothes are now
a thing from your past,

25:11.500 --> 25:15.700
we should give them to people who
really need them. my pink floyd t-shirt.

25:15.700 --> 25:17.600
you're giving away
my pink floyd t-shirt?

25:18.000 --> 25:18.800
i was planning to.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.300
but i got this when they
played the worcester centrum,

25:22.200 --> 25:25.100
and ikey and i managed
to scam our way into the pit.

25:25.900 --> 25:27.500
my b.u. sweatshirt.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.400
beanpot 1998.

25:30.700 --> 25:32.500
eddie and i and a couple girls
from pine manor c-

25:32.500 --> 25:35.200
okay, okay.
i can only imagine.

25:38.900 --> 25:40.500
you really think
i should give these away?

25:41.500 --> 25:44.500
i don't know. you ever
gonna wear them again?

25:46.100 --> 25:47.000
no.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.000
hmm.

25:50.300 --> 25:53.000
'cause it seems to me
that maybe, just maybe,

25:54.500 --> 25:56.800
being naked isn't as freeing
as it first seemed.

25:57.700 --> 25:58.900
you know, your clothes...

26:00.200 --> 26:02.100
they don't just allow you
to walk outside of the house

26:02.100 --> 26:04.200
without being arrested
for indecent exposure.

26:04.600 --> 26:05.400
they take you back

26:06.700 --> 26:09.500
to places and people
you used to know.

26:12.200 --> 26:14.700
so maybe by staying nude,

26:14.800 --> 26:17.600
you're cutting yourself off
from the rest of the world,

26:18.500 --> 26:20.100
turning yourself
into a prisoner in a way.

26:20.900 --> 26:22.800
you're a prisoner even more
than you already were.

26:25.800 --> 26:26.800
oh.

26:29.500 --> 26:30.400
i don't think so.

26:34.500 --> 26:35.300
hey. what's up, man?

26:35.300 --> 26:38.200
oh, brown bagging it
today, huh? oh, yeah.

26:38.300 --> 26:40.600
the commander was making one of
his b.l.t.s this morning, so...

26:40.600 --> 26:42.500
so, nick, listen.
i was, uh, i washinkin'.

26:43.700 --> 26:47.700
maybe we can go even bigger
with the commercial.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.400
what we need
is a barroom brawl.

26:51.200 --> 26:52.000
a barroom brawl?

26:52.100 --> 26:54.500
a barroom brawl. see,
we hire a couple stunt guys,

26:54.800 --> 26:56.600
and as they throw each other
through the windows,

26:56.600 --> 26:59.300
we use digital effects
to put 'em back together.

26:59.600 --> 27:02.900
huh? not bad.
stuntmen and special effects?

27:02.900 --> 27:05.200
yeah, it-it-it might cost,
like, 10, 15 grand

27:05.200 --> 27:06.600
over the original 40...
hmm.

27:06.600 --> 27:08.100
but i really think
it's the way to go.

27:08.100 --> 27:10.600
i mean,
assuming that you can, uh,

27:10.600 --> 27:14.000
you know, cover the extra costs. oh, i
can handle it. yeah, it's-it's not a, um...

27:17.300 --> 27:20.400
the universe
is a cruel, cruel prankster.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.400
i mean, jenny was everything
i'd hoped she'd be and more.

27:23.500 --> 27:26.200
we got along so well.
we had so much in common.

27:26.700 --> 27:29.200
so where's the cruel joke?
well, according to sully

27:29.200 --> 27:30.600
and the scuttlebutt
on the street,

27:31.700 --> 27:34.500
jenny likes girls
and only girls.

27:34.700 --> 27:36.400
really?
really?

27:36.400 --> 27:37.200
really.

27:38.400 --> 27:40.100
oh, come on, man.
you can't believe sully,

27:40.400 --> 27:41.900
and you can rarely trust
scuttlebutt.

27:41.900 --> 27:45.100
<i>plus why would she have
agreed to a second date</i>

27:45.100 --> 27:48.400
if she wasn't at least a little
interested? whoa. you got a second date?

27:48.400 --> 27:50.700
at least i thought it was.
well, so you'll clear it up then.

27:50.700 --> 27:52.300
wait a second.
let me get this straight.

27:52.700 --> 27:55.200
this girl is hot,
she likes other girls

27:55.700 --> 27:57.200
<i>and she drives
a beer truck?</i>

27:57.700 --> 27:58.500
so it seems.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.200
what are you whining about,
guy?

28:01.700 --> 28:03.300
you just hit the trifecta.

28:04.900 --> 28:05.900
congratulations.

28:16.200 --> 28:17.100
wow!

28:17.200 --> 28:19.400
you look fantastic.
oh.

28:19.700 --> 28:21.900
oh, here. let me help you.
thank you.

28:22.400 --> 28:25.500
a dress? if i would have known,
i would have worn a tie.

28:25.500 --> 28:27.700
no, you look great
just the way you are.

28:27.700 --> 28:30.400
oh. to tell you the truth,
i probably overdid it.

28:30.900 --> 28:33.400
oh, so you usually
don't wear a dress

28:33.400 --> 28:34.400
when you're not working?

28:34.400 --> 28:35.500
no, i do.

28:35.500 --> 28:38.600
i just wanted to look
particularly hot today.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.200
you did?

28:40.200 --> 28:44.000
yeah, i went to lowell
to return my ex's books and cds,

28:44.000 --> 28:47.400
so i figured
i'd spruce things up a bit.

28:47.500 --> 28:48.300
oh.

28:48.600 --> 28:51.500
um, what's your's name?

28:51.800 --> 28:52.700
chris.

28:53.400 --> 28:55.300
it's awful of me, i know.
i just-

28:55.700 --> 28:58.000
i thought if i walked
in there looking hot

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
that chris might regret
moving on.

29:01.100 --> 29:03.600
and-and did you see chris?
i did.

29:03.800 --> 29:06.200
what was chris wearing?
an old "i've moved on

29:06.200 --> 29:08.600
and have nothing to prove
to you" t-shirt and jeans.

29:09.400 --> 29:11.000
and-and what kind of shoes?

29:11.600 --> 29:13.500
um, barefoot.

29:15.200 --> 29:17.600
is chris a man chris
or a lady chris?

29:20.000 --> 29:22.400
a... lady chris,
of course.

29:22.700 --> 29:23.600
why "of course"?

29:24.500 --> 29:26.200
this is something
one is to assume?

29:27.300 --> 29:28.700
i thought it was obvious.

29:39.400 --> 29:40.600
do you remember
when i was 11,

29:41.600 --> 29:45.600
and stephy gower's mother
let us watch "the exorcist"?

29:46.900 --> 29:47.800
of course.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.600
you couldn't sleep
for days after.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.400
every night, i cried.

29:54.200 --> 29:55.500
every night, i was convinced

29:55.500 --> 29:57.200
that i was gonna
be possessed by the devil

29:58.200 --> 29:59.800
and that my head
would spin around,

30:00.200 --> 30:02.000
and then i would
throw up green goo.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.400
and before you went
to bed every night,

30:04.400 --> 30:06.900
you made me promise
that you wouldn't throw up.

30:07.700 --> 30:09.400
and i'd bring you
a glass of water,

30:09.600 --> 30:10.800
and we'd say that prayer.

30:12.500 --> 30:13.300
do you remember it?

30:17.600 --> 30:19.600
"god is
in this glass of water.

30:20.200 --> 30:21.600
god is in this cup."

30:21.900 --> 30:23.700
please, god, please,
no green throw up.

30:27.900 --> 30:29.200
every night, for weeks-

30:30.500 --> 30:31.600
"you promise me, ma?"

30:32.900 --> 30:34.200
and then a few times
you went out

30:34.200 --> 30:36.200
without saying the prayer
with me before you left.

30:36.900 --> 30:39.300
and you had the babysitter
track us down

30:39.800 --> 30:42.400
at the restaurants,
at movies.

30:42.400 --> 30:44.100
i would make you say it
over the phone,

30:46.600 --> 30:47.900
and you'd promise me.

30:51.300 --> 30:52.700
you always took care of me,
mom,

30:53.800 --> 30:56.100
which is why, ten years ago,
when everything happened,

30:57.300 --> 30:58.200
i listened to you.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.800
and now you regret
that you did?

31:01.300 --> 31:02.500
it's just,
you keep telling me

31:02.500 --> 31:05.600
this is a confusing landscape
for sam, for everyone,

31:06.300 --> 31:09.900
buthe truth is,
you created this landscape.

31:10.200 --> 31:11.800
<i>i created the landscape?</i>

31:12.100 --> 31:14.100
you were pregnant. you didn't
know who the father was.

31:14.100 --> 31:16.100
it was one of two people,
and gavin wasn't one of them,

31:16.100 --> 31:18.200
and you knew that, and you chose him anyway.

31:18.300 --> 31:22.000
somebody had to take charge. you were a 17-year-old girl.

31:22.300 --> 31:23.500
your heart
was shattered to bits.

31:23.500 --> 31:27.100
you were out of control. and what?
by assigning paternity to gavin-

31:27.100 --> 31:29.400
that was your way
of keeping things in control?

31:29.400 --> 31:33.400
it was my way of trying
to make life easier for you

31:33.700 --> 31:34.800
and for sam.

31:34.800 --> 31:35.700
by lying?

31:35.800 --> 31:38.400
no, by protecting-

31:39.100 --> 31:41.100
by protecting you
and protecting sam.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.000
that's what we do.

31:42.500 --> 31:45.100
hannah jane, as mothers...

31:46.800 --> 31:48.800
we fight to keep
our children safe.

31:49.800 --> 31:52.000
we defend. we safeguard.

31:52.200 --> 31:53.100
we love.

31:54.100 --> 31:58.300
it's no different from promising
a scared, little 11-year-old

31:58.300 --> 32:00.200
that she's not gonna
throw up green goo.

32:01.500 --> 32:03.000
i fight for sam every day,
ma.

32:03.400 --> 32:05.100
i know you do, sweetheart.

32:06.100 --> 32:07.600
so why do you
take issue with me

32:07.600 --> 32:09.400
fighting for you
ten years ago?

32:09.800 --> 32:10.700
i don't...

32:12.000 --> 32:13.500
but it's time to stop.

32:32.800 --> 32:33.600
hi

32:34.900 --> 32:36.300
nice place you got here,
nick.

32:36.300 --> 32:37.800
it's been a long time,
mr. daniels.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.100
it's good to see you.
how's the cape?

32:40.300 --> 32:42.100
great.
what retirement should be.

32:42.500 --> 32:45.800
i read, play a little golf,
grow a few tomatoes-good stuff.

32:46.300 --> 32:47.200
that's nice.

32:48.800 --> 32:49.600
nice.

32:52.700 --> 32:56.400
huh. uh, we, uh, had
a nice thing, you and i,

32:56.800 --> 32:59.000
all those years
you dated hannah jane.

32:59.400 --> 33:00.400
yeah, you can say so.

33:00.600 --> 33:03.200
so, um, around the time
you were due back

33:03.200 --> 33:06.200
from your european jaunt-
when you didn't show,

33:07.600 --> 33:09.400
ellen said
you weren't coming home.

33:10.700 --> 33:12.600
hannah jane and i
told her she was crazy,

33:14.100 --> 33:16.300
but then a few weeks later,

33:16.300 --> 33:18.100
and still no you.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.700
hannah jane
started to think so, too,

33:22.600 --> 33:23.700
but not me.

33:25.200 --> 33:27.600
i always believed
that someday you'd be back.

33:28.200 --> 33:30.700
of course,
after a few months,

33:30.900 --> 33:33.000
a year even,
i started to have my doubts,

33:34.300 --> 33:35.800
especially all those nights

33:35.800 --> 33:38.400
i'd hear my little girl
sobbing herself to sleep.

33:44.900 --> 33:46.900
hannah's in a good place now,
nick.

33:48.300 --> 33:49.800
i hope you'll let her
stay there.

33:50.300 --> 33:52.000
yeah, yeah, of course, sir,

33:52.000 --> 33:55.400
and i... i'm sorry
for everything, mr. daniels.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.200
it was a...

33:57.800 --> 33:59.600
it was a pretty crazy time
in my life, and, uh,

33:59.600 --> 34:01.900
you know, i don't offer that
as an excuse-

34:01.900 --> 34:05.200
only, um... an explanation.

34:05.400 --> 34:08.300
you don't owe me anything.
you did what you needed to do.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.100
you left home.
you expanded your capacities.

34:11.800 --> 34:14.000
you wrote a book-
a best seller.

34:16.000 --> 34:16.900
and then...

34:17.500 --> 34:20.100
you did something
even more impressive than that.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.600
you came home,
and you faced the music.

34:26.100 --> 34:27.100
you did, nicky.

34:41.100 --> 34:41.900
hey.
hey.

34:42.699 --> 34:46.300
what do you think?
stripes? no stripes?

34:46.400 --> 34:49.000
thank god you're here.
i've been trying your cell all morning.

34:49.100 --> 34:50.800
the effects guys
never showed.

34:51.100 --> 34:54.000
yeah, that's, uh, that's
because there's no commercial.

34:55.400 --> 34:57.100
it's over.
huh?

34:57.300 --> 34:58.300
listen, everyone.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.500
can i have your attention,
please?

35:01.300 --> 35:04.100
yeah, can everyone
gather around? everybody?

35:06.400 --> 35:07.400
all right, um,

35:09.000 --> 35:10.500
look, i know-
i know you all

35:11.300 --> 35:13.700
came here today expecting
to make a commercial, but...

35:15.900 --> 35:18.500
i gotta pull the plug.
i'm-i'm really sorry, guys.

35:18.900 --> 35:20.200
but thank you
for coming out.

35:21.600 --> 35:22.700
i appreciate your time.

35:24.200 --> 35:25.000
thank you.

35:27.100 --> 35:28.000
sorry, guys.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.500
i could get into a big long deal
about how and why,

35:34.900 --> 35:36.600
but the bottom line
is i'm out of cash.

35:36.900 --> 35:40.900
what do you mean out of cash? like broke,
busted, beggared? yeah, pretty much that.

35:40.900 --> 35:43.200
did you know your partner
here was tapped? no, he didn't-

35:43.200 --> 35:45.200
i did.
you did?

35:45.300 --> 35:48.400
i ran into mack hill
at sully's-the loan guy.

35:48.500 --> 35:51.600
he told me everything. hence the
barroom brawl and the stuntmen.

35:51.800 --> 35:52.900
couldn't help myself.

35:55.200 --> 35:56.100
so, um...

35:58.300 --> 35:59.900
how is this going to affect
the window shop?

36:00.400 --> 36:04.300
well, we've only got
two jobs so far, so...

36:06.400 --> 36:08.400
we're just gonna have to work
our butts off to get more.

36:09.100 --> 36:09.900
you game?

36:10.100 --> 36:12.700
i'm game,
so long as in the future,

36:12.900 --> 36:16.300
<i>we have money problems,
you come talk to me, partner.</i>

36:16.800 --> 36:17.600
you got it.

36:18.800 --> 36:21.200
so am i officially
out of the commercial?

36:22.800 --> 36:25.000
i'm afraid your television debut
will have to wait.

36:26.900 --> 36:29.700
maybe not, kid. i think i might
have something up my sleeve.

36:33.300 --> 36:35.400
thanks for seeing me
two days in a row.

36:36.200 --> 36:37.000
are you kiddin'?

36:37.400 --> 36:40.500
i'd have lunch with you
74 days in a row if i could.

36:41.300 --> 36:42.200
you know what's weird?

36:43.500 --> 36:47.000
<i>i couldn't say that
to a girl who was available.</i>

36:47.400 --> 36:50.000
"i'd have lunch
74 days in a row."

36:50.400 --> 36:52.900
but since
you're not available

36:53.800 --> 36:55.300
and therefore, not scary,

36:56.700 --> 36:58.100
i can tell you that

36:59.100 --> 37:00.000
you make me...

37:01.400 --> 37:03.000
very, very, happy-sad.

37:06.100 --> 37:10.700
i'm... pretty overflowing
with happy sadness myself.

37:11.900 --> 37:13.600
on the one hand,
i miss chris,

37:13.900 --> 37:15.800
and on the other hand,

37:16.500 --> 37:18.200
you're sweet. you're funny,

37:19.300 --> 37:20.600
and you owe me your life.

37:26.900 --> 37:29.300
if i ever do come around
to boys, owen,

37:30.000 --> 37:31.300
i can tell you one thing.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
you're gonna be
the first on my list.

37:39.700 --> 37:41.800
i'll be back when the kegs
are kicked. can i call you?

37:42.100 --> 37:43.000
you bet.

37:44.900 --> 37:47.700
and be careful
wi the hot wings till then.

37:58.100 --> 38:00.500
whoa!
okay, what are you doing?

38:00.800 --> 38:03.100
savoring every last bit
of this hot peppers and steak.

38:03.300 --> 38:05.300
yeah, i mean why aren't you
wearing any clothes?

38:05.900 --> 38:09.400
mm. well,
you made such a fuss

38:09.400 --> 38:11.200
about the virtues
of being set free,

38:11.200 --> 38:12.800
i figured i'd give it a try,

38:12.800 --> 38:16.800
<i>and you know what?
it is really liberating.</i>

38:17.700 --> 38:19.300
i may never wear
clothes again either.

38:20.300 --> 38:21.400
but you n't...

38:22.400 --> 38:23.400
if-if i'm...

38:23.600 --> 38:24.400
i'm...

38:25.900 --> 38:26.700
fine.

38:28.300 --> 38:29.100
done.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.900
my days of nudism
are over.

38:32.200 --> 38:33.300
what? why?

38:33.300 --> 38:36.600
oh, come on, eddie.
we can't live like this.

38:36.800 --> 38:40.100
i mean, one guy naked-
it's charming. it's quirky,

38:40.700 --> 38:42.000
but two guys-it's.

38:43.100 --> 38:46.700
it's... not something
i'm comfortable with.

38:55.000 --> 38:55.700
whoo.

38:56.500 --> 38:59.000
yeah, i've said it before,
and i'll say it again.

38:59.500 --> 39:01.500
the pizza girl ain't
the only one who delivers.

39:04.600 --> 39:05.400
thanks, ray.

39:05.400 --> 39:07.000
hey, thanks for coming.
oh, come here.

39:08.300 --> 39:09.100
dad.

39:11.900 --> 39:13.400
go say good-bye
to your grandpa.

39:17.300 --> 39:18.100
hey!

39:21.400 --> 39:23.300
it was a good visit,
hannah jane.

39:23.500 --> 39:24.700
i think so, too, ma.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.700
you should know
that even though

39:31.700 --> 39:34.000
i don't agree
with your catering choices,

39:34.500 --> 39:35.900
i do understand them,

39:36.600 --> 39:39.900
and i will do
whatever i can to help you.

39:43.500 --> 39:44.700
you promise me, ma?

39:46.800 --> 39:48.900
i promise you, hannah jane.

40:04.800 --> 40:06.100
all right,
let's have a look, then.

40:25.900 --> 40:28.400
hey, guys.
hey, looking good.

40:28.400 --> 40:29.400
hey, hey!

40:36.600 --> 40:37.400
good bye, all.

40:37.800 --> 40:38.800
like your bike.

40:44.600 --> 40:45.400
<i>playful breed...</i>

41:01.400 --> 41:02.500
<i>best friend windows.</i>

41:02.900 --> 41:06.400
<i>we're at 658 maple street,
