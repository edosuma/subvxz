00:00.709 --> 00:02.085
Previously on
<i>Recovery Road...</i>

00:02.085 --> 00:04.046
Hey, bae! Why did you
come to school with
the guidance counselor?

00:04.046 --> 00:06.173
We are both
on Maddie's side, right?

00:06.173 --> 00:08.133
‐I miss you.
‐I miss you, too.

00:08.133 --> 00:10.260
I just feel so cut off
from everyone.

00:10.260 --> 00:13.096
I don't think I would
pull my child away
from the help she needs

00:13.096 --> 00:15.098
and take her home with me
just because I was
a little lonely.

00:15.098 --> 00:17.935
‐How's Maddie doing?
‐She's not taking
it seriously.

00:17.935 --> 00:19.811
I do have a group of friends
who have sustained me

00:19.811 --> 00:21.271
through some
pretty tough times.

00:21.271 --> 00:23.106
Just dinner with Zach.
We won't drink.

00:23.106 --> 00:25.359
A small party
in a hotel suite.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.277
And you're
going to stay sober?

00:27.277 --> 00:29.154
I find your complete
lack of confidence in me

00:29.154 --> 00:30.989
highly disruptive
to my sobriety.

00:30.989 --> 00:33.825
‐Was she his girlfriend?
‐Harper: <i>They made me</i>
<i>call him.</i>

00:33.825 --> 00:36.537
‐He owed them money.
‐Who was he?

00:36.537 --> 00:38.705
‐Nobody.
‐I woke up in lockup.

00:38.705 --> 00:41.792
They told me I stabbed
my cheating husband
four times.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.418
I just want
my little girl back.

00:43.418 --> 00:46.004
You can start
waiting tables
at Margarita's.

00:47.339 --> 00:48.757
Maddie's voice:
<i>I don't know when it was</i>

00:48.757 --> 00:51.093
<i>that we began to lose control.</i>

00:51.093 --> 00:54.137
<i>Was there a specific moment</i>
<i>when it all started to turn?</i>

00:54.137 --> 00:56.098
<i>Or did it unravel</i>
<i>little by little</i>

00:56.098 --> 00:57.808
<i>until there</i>
<i>was nothing left</i>

00:57.808 --> 00:59.893
<i>and the Earth</i>
<i>tilted off its axis</i>

00:59.893 --> 01:02.938
<i>and we were hurled out</i>
<i>into the darkness</i>
<i>of the unknown world?</i>

01:02.938 --> 01:04.356
<i>The vacuous space,</i>

01:04.356 --> 01:05.732
<i>the intolerable nothing,</i>

01:05.732 --> 01:07.734
<i>yet we still try</i>
<i>to carry on.</i>

01:12.239 --> 01:13.699
Gael:
What the hell
are you doing?

01:15.284 --> 01:17.119
You think I'm stupid,
don't you?

01:17.119 --> 01:18.620
You think I don't know
what you did,

01:18.620 --> 01:21.123
but I know,
and I know everything.

01:21.123 --> 01:22.541
You're not making any sense.

01:22.541 --> 01:27.379
There's meth in the floor,
and it's in the walls. Look.

01:27.379 --> 01:30.465
Look.
Look what I found
in the wall.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.384
You're hiding it everywhere.

01:32.384 --> 01:34.303
That's the insulation.

01:34.303 --> 01:36.179
Okay?
That's fiberglass.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.348
No. Stop lying!
You're always‐‐

01:38.348 --> 01:40.851
God damn it!
You always cheating me!

01:40.851 --> 01:42.936
Hey! Shh, shh.
Baby, come on.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.146
We smoked the last
of it already.

01:44.146 --> 01:46.106
I'm going to hook up
with Twitch in an hour

01:46.106 --> 01:47.357
to get us another teener.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.359
No. You hid it from me.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.737
You've been up
for three days, okay?

01:51.737 --> 01:53.363
You need to sleep a little.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.916
I love you, baby.

02:10.255 --> 02:13.133
Maddie.
It's time to wake up.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.218
Come on, Sleeping Beauty.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.553
Bite me.

02:16.553 --> 02:19.723
How can you stay in bed
on a day like today?

02:19.723 --> 02:21.475
Today is
my first day at work.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.393
I'm going to be able
to pay my lawyer

02:23.393 --> 02:25.103
and get my little boo back.

02:25.103 --> 02:27.439
I cannot wait
for you to meet her.

02:27.439 --> 02:30.233
She is the cutest
thing in the world.

02:30.233 --> 02:32.486
Maddie! Are you
even listening to me?

02:32.486 --> 02:34.237
Come on,
you got to get up.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.114
Do you like
my slap bracelet?

02:36.114 --> 02:39.451
Is it too old‐school
or cool old‐school?

02:39.451 --> 02:41.787
‐I can never tell.
‐Trish!

02:43.246 --> 02:44.873
What are you doing?

02:44.873 --> 02:47.668
I'm getting ready for work.
Don't I look nice?

02:47.668 --> 02:50.003
Come now.
We got group before we go.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.255
I can't wake up Maddie.

02:58.637 --> 03:00.347
(groans)

03:00.347 --> 03:02.766
That's how you wake up
a teenager.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.728
‐Good morning!
‐Yeah.

03:08.480 --> 03:13.110
Okay. Good morning, everyone.
Welcome to Animal Farm.

03:15.487 --> 03:19.116
I'm going to invite you all
to go into the basket

03:19.116 --> 03:20.659
and pick out
a different animal

03:20.659 --> 03:23.412
to represent each member
of your immediate family.

03:23.412 --> 03:27.416
‐(groaning)
‐Now, now, come on, guys.

03:36.425 --> 03:37.843
(squeaks)

03:39.219 --> 03:41.721
So, I'm the cat,

03:41.721 --> 03:44.975
because I like
to sleep all day

03:44.975 --> 03:48.979
and sit on the couch
and watch TV.

03:50.188 --> 03:54.234
Did you know that cats
actually do watch TV?

03:54.234 --> 03:55.986
‐It's a thing.
‐Huh!

03:58.447 --> 04:00.949
So, I'm the squirrel
and my mom is the cat,

04:00.949 --> 04:02.742
because I don't care.

04:05.537 --> 04:08.415
(growling)

04:08.415 --> 04:10.000
(sighing)

04:19.509 --> 04:22.262
And that's my husband.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.431
It is interesting
how you put them
in order like that.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.100
It's kind of militaristic.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.561
They all work
at my restaurant.

04:29.561 --> 04:31.104
And that's your husband?

04:32.230 --> 04:34.274
Why is he
the teeny tiny turtle?

04:34.274 --> 04:36.693
(cell phone buzzing)

04:36.693 --> 04:39.696
Hey. There are
no phones in group,
you know that.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.156
Sorry.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.994
Wes, go ahead
and pick out your family.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.704
There is no way in hell
I'm doing that.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.041
‐Excuse me?
‐I said I'm not doing it.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.511
(theme music playing)

05:04.012 --> 05:07.808
<i>♪ This time is my time,</i>
<i>so step aside ♪</i>

05:10.560 --> 05:12.646
Glover.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.940
This is Trish,
our new waitress.

05:14.940 --> 05:17.400
Trish, this is
my son Glover.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.401
Hey.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.822
Okay, you'll be
training her.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.448
Okay, get going.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.158
And make sure you put
the silverware

05:25.158 --> 05:26.660
on top of the napkins
this time.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.036
No one wants
to eat with a fork

05:28.036 --> 05:30.163
that's been
sitting on the table.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.583
Mom's got a system
for everything.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.794
But...

05:35.794 --> 05:37.587
you learn
to get used to it.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.047
I'm going to be
really good at this job.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.590
I can just feel it.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.467
Have you waited tables before?

05:42.467 --> 05:44.219
‐No.
‐Oh.

05:44.219 --> 05:46.429
Well, where have you worked?

05:46.429 --> 05:47.722
I went to college
for a little bit,

05:47.722 --> 05:49.266
but then I became
a crystal meth addict,

05:49.266 --> 05:50.517
so you know how that goes.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.352
Anyway, then I lost
custody of my daughter,

05:52.352 --> 05:54.646
so that's why
I really need this job.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.482
Well, good.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.484
But just a piece of advice,

05:59.484 --> 06:02.571
you might want
to keep that to yourself
when my dad comes in.

06:02.571 --> 06:04.990
Wait, your dad is alive?

06:04.990 --> 06:07.117
‐I thought
your mom killed him.
‐Wait, what?

06:07.117 --> 06:09.786
No, she just
stabbed him a few times.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.581
Oh.

06:12.581 --> 06:14.332
So what is she
always worrying about?

06:22.507 --> 06:25.510
You know, all my friends are
going to the beach today.

06:25.510 --> 06:29.055
I mean all of them,
and I'm stuck here with you

06:29.055 --> 06:32.475
on a Sunday alone
with the cleaning crew.

06:32.475 --> 06:35.437
You've been to enough
AA meetings at this point.

06:35.437 --> 06:37.147
What's the thing
they say at the end?

06:37.147 --> 06:38.940
‐The Serenity Prayer?
‐No, after that.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.484
‐"Keep coming back."
‐And then after that?

06:41.484 --> 06:43.653
‐"It works if you work it"?
‐Yes!

06:43.653 --> 06:44.988
Ding, ding, ding!
That's right!

06:44.988 --> 06:47.490
It works if you work it,
and only if you work it.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.200
‐So you need
to start working it.
‐I am.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.535
‐What do you think
I'm doing?
‐All right.

06:50.535 --> 06:52.120
So, what step are you on?

06:54.247 --> 06:55.498
‐Step?
‐Yes.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.500
You are aware
that Alcoholics Anonymous

06:57.500 --> 07:00.003
is based on something
called "the 12 Steps."

07:00.003 --> 07:02.297
I don't like sarcasm on you.
That's my thing.

07:02.297 --> 07:03.798
Maddie,
part of the deal we made

07:03.798 --> 07:06.134
was that you were
going to do the work
and take it seriously.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.719
You really need
to start working the steps,

07:07.719 --> 07:09.512
and you really need
to choose a sponsor.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.598
‐Sponsor? I‐‐
‐I talked it over with Craig,

07:11.598 --> 07:15.143
and we both agree
you need to choose a sponsor
by the end of the week

07:15.143 --> 07:17.562
so you can start
working the steps.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.856
Fine.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.693
Then why don't you do it?

07:23.693 --> 07:26.363
Me? You want me
to be your sponsor?

07:26.363 --> 07:29.282
‐Sure.
‐Wow.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.867
Maddie,
I am really touched.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.331
‐Great.
‐Yes.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.958
So, start with step one.

07:38.958 --> 07:42.587
Go ahead and write out a list
of all the ways

07:42.587 --> 07:44.130
that you feel your life
has become unmanageable.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.341
Oh, my God,
there's sober homework.

07:46.341 --> 07:52.263
Of course. And here is
a copy of the <i>Big Book,</i>

07:52.263 --> 07:54.683
the <i>Twelve and Twelve,</i>
<i>As Bill Sees It,</i>

07:54.683 --> 07:56.518
daily meditations.

07:56.518 --> 07:59.938
Oh, this is a great list
of sober bloggers.

07:59.938 --> 08:03.024
The one about
the sober dog?
Awesome.

08:04.609 --> 08:07.654
‐Okay, and then just roll?
‐Yeah, roll it. Make it tight.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.155
‐Okay.
‐It's all right.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.783
‐Hey, son.
‐Hey, Pops.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.493
‐Hello.
‐Hello.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.245
And who are you?

08:15.245 --> 08:17.455
Oh, you must be the turtle.

08:17.455 --> 08:20.583
‐The what?
‐Hi, I'm Trish.
I'm the new waitress.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.752
Margarita used to
be my roommate
at Springtime Meadows‐‐

08:22.752 --> 08:25.588
only until she asked
Craig to move her
because I snore.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.549
But I like my new
roommate, too, though.

08:27.549 --> 08:28.717
She's really nice,
good hygiene,

08:28.717 --> 08:31.094
and she's never even
tried crystal.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.679
Uh‐huh.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.399
What the hell are you doing

08:44.399 --> 08:47.318
bringing some crazy girl
from your rehab down here

08:47.318 --> 08:50.280
‐to work in our restaurant?
‐My restaurant.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.490
She here because
I want her here.

08:52.490 --> 08:53.867
End of discussion.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.961
(dramatic music playing
on television)

09:09.674 --> 09:11.051
<i>I can't.</i>

09:11.051 --> 09:12.761
<i>You took away my ability</i>
<i>to feel anything</i>

09:12.761 --> 09:15.513
<i>but anger and contempt.</i>

09:15.513 --> 09:17.599
<i>Don't speak that way,</i>
<i>my love.</i>

09:17.599 --> 09:19.976
This is the worst thing
I've ever seen in my life.

09:19.976 --> 09:22.604
Yeah, this is the one
where Sebastiano

09:22.604 --> 09:24.981
tells Constance
that he has terminal cancer,

09:24.981 --> 09:27.317
and she tells him
that his ex‐wife

09:27.317 --> 09:29.277
was a serial killer.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.154
‐Constance: <i>My father!</i>
‐Weird.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.864
Constance:
<i>He was the only family</i>
<i>I had left.</i>

09:32.864 --> 09:35.366
Well, he's lying
about the cancer.

09:35.366 --> 09:36.951
(TV turns off)

09:36.951 --> 09:39.913
Someone who
lived here before

09:39.913 --> 09:41.664
must have really
liked this show

09:41.664 --> 09:44.417
because they taped,
like, seriously,

09:44.417 --> 09:46.836
every episode.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.963
‐And there are thousands.
‐Ugh.

09:48.963 --> 09:51.758
Tell me this isn't
as good as it gets
in sobriety.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.135
You're not having
a good time?

09:54.135 --> 09:57.222
No. I mean,
I like hanging out with you,

09:57.222 --> 09:59.474
but it's Sunday,

09:59.474 --> 10:00.809
and instead
of doing something fun,

10:00.809 --> 10:04.646
we're sitting here
in a basement watching
<i>Storms of the Heart,</i>

10:04.646 --> 10:06.397
and you've already
seen this episode.

10:06.397 --> 10:08.024
How was the party?

10:10.318 --> 10:14.697
It sucked.
All my friends were wasted
and I wasn't.

10:14.697 --> 10:18.868
And after going all
Jonestown massacre
on my own ass,

10:18.868 --> 10:23.498
I don't know if I'll ever
be able to hang out
with them again.

10:23.498 --> 10:27.210
‐Jonestown massacre?
‐It's something my friends
and I like to say

10:27.210 --> 10:29.337
when we're jonesing.

10:31.381 --> 10:32.632
You know what?

10:34.676 --> 10:38.138
I get how hard
it is to let go of
those friendships.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.890
But the thing
that I've found
is that, honestly,

10:40.890 --> 10:43.268
those people who
I thought were my friends,

10:43.268 --> 10:46.688
when I was sober,
I really didn't
like them that much.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.858
Is that a terrible
thing to say?

10:49.858 --> 10:52.152
No. Not at all.

10:55.029 --> 10:57.740
How long did you
make it through
the last time?

10:57.740 --> 10:59.742
I had a pretty great
six months once.

10:59.742 --> 11:04.581
Six months?
You weren't totally miserable
for the whole time?

11:04.581 --> 11:06.958
‐No.
‐How'd you do it?

11:06.958 --> 11:08.793
I didn't drink or use
for six months.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.337
Oh.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.757
No, but‐‐ but how?

11:14.757 --> 11:17.260
I mean it.
I really want to know,

11:17.260 --> 11:19.470
because right now
drinking anti‐freeze

11:19.470 --> 11:20.763
seems like a more
viable life option.

11:20.763 --> 11:23.349
Maybe mix it in
with a little orange juice,

11:23.349 --> 11:24.809
some ground‐up
light bulbs.

11:24.809 --> 11:28.062
Really put a lot of thought
into this, haven't you?

11:28.062 --> 11:30.815
Well, there was one thing
that I used to do.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.945
I used to fly
these model planes.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.658
We could build one
if you want.

11:41.784 --> 11:45.538
All right.
Let's do it. Why not?

11:45.538 --> 11:48.333

11:48.333 --> 11:51.127

12:31.209 --> 12:33.628

My fist ever plane.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.970
I feel like
in this gold, right?

12:41.970 --> 12:45.807

‐I should take this.

12:45.807 --> 12:49.102
‐Hey, Cynthia.
‐Charlotte, I'm glad
I caught you.

12:50.645 --> 12:53.982
‐Is everything okay?
‐Yeah, yeah. I just‐‐
I wanted to let you know

12:53.982 --> 12:56.442
that Maddie asked me
to be her sponsor
this morning,

12:56.442 --> 12:59.988
and I wanted to make sure
that that's fine with you.

12:59.988 --> 13:02.115
‐Her sponsor?
‐Yeah.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.075
Basically, it means
I'll be taking her

13:04.075 --> 13:06.160
through the 12 steps
of Alcoholics Anonymous.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.871
Oh, yes, of course.
Well, you know
all about that,

13:08.871 --> 13:10.748
and you'll be
a big help to her.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.542
I just wanted to make sure.

13:12.542 --> 13:15.878
Okay. Uh‐huh.
Thanks for calling. Bye.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.967
I like this one.

13:36.607 --> 13:39.444
You got to really
crank the throttle
coming in for landing.

13:39.444 --> 13:42.071
Everything you just said
sounds like a euphemism.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.198
‐What?
‐Nothing.

♪ Here we go,

13:48.286 --> 13:49.954
This is nice and all,

13:49.954 --> 13:52.790
but it isn't exactly
the cathartic experience
I've been looking for.

13:52.790 --> 13:55.126
All right, well,
you can try flying it
if you want.

13:55.126 --> 13:57.962

14:02.967 --> 14:04.844
‐Aah! Sorry.
‐That's okay.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.183
This can't have been
the only thing

14:10.183 --> 14:12.101
that kept you sober
for six months.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.853
I mean,
that's an eternity.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.064
No. It wasn't the only thing.

14:16.064 --> 14:18.107
Here.

14:18.107 --> 14:20.610
I realize you're doing
the whole mysterious,

14:20.610 --> 14:24.155
dark, brooding,
whatever, loner thing,

14:24.155 --> 14:28.242
but would it kill you
to be just a little
bit verbose?

14:28.242 --> 14:29.994
I don't know.
Is that the right word?

14:29.994 --> 14:31.954
Verbose works, yeah.

14:31.954 --> 14:34.499
I guess I just
don't like talking about it,

14:34.499 --> 14:38.419
because I messed it up
so badly.

14:38.419 --> 14:40.505
‐Messed up what?
‐The job I had

14:40.505 --> 14:42.757
those last sixth months
I was sober.

14:42.757 --> 14:44.967
You didn't work
at the movie theater?

14:44.967 --> 14:47.845
No, it was, like,
a real job job.

14:47.845 --> 14:50.890
I worked for a contractor
building houses

14:50.890 --> 14:52.308
and furniture
and all this cool stuff.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.143
‐It was great.
‐Wow.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.896
‐That is cool.
‐Yeah, but...

14:59.065 --> 15:02.151
I would never be able
to get a job like that again.

15:03.486 --> 15:05.905
Not with my history.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.740
Oh.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.868
But I got my plane.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.460
Maddie:
Mom, this is Wes.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.171
Wes, this is my mom.

15:22.171 --> 15:24.340
Hey.

15:27.218 --> 15:29.262
Hey, it's nice
to meet you.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.431
I mean,
officially this time.

15:33.766 --> 15:34.934
Yeah.

15:47.905 --> 15:51.200
Please tell me
we're not actually going
to the beach today.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.120
‐I can't move.
‐Oh, thank God.

15:54.120 --> 15:58.082
(British accent)
Let us lie here
languidly like lettuce leaves.

15:58.082 --> 16:02.128
‐Are you still drunk?
‐Mm‐hmm. I think I am.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.213
Do you remember
the party we had last night?

16:04.213 --> 16:08.092
Nope. All I know
is that I feel like ass.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.179
Oh, what I do recall,

16:11.179 --> 16:15.850
is I totally made out
with Astrid Holloway.

16:15.850 --> 16:18.102
Mm‐hmm.

16:18.102 --> 16:20.229
Oh, no.

16:20.229 --> 16:23.482
Devin puked
on Candace's top.

16:23.482 --> 16:26.861
Candace chugged
a half a bottle
of cough syrup.

16:26.861 --> 16:30.531
‐Who even does that?
‐Yeah, she's an idiot.

16:30.531 --> 16:34.702
She's two bad decisions away
from vodka‐soaked tampons.

16:34.702 --> 16:39.332
Did Maddie leave with an uncle
that we've never heard of

16:39.332 --> 16:42.793
and that actress who
was on <i>Misfits of Mayhem?</i>

16:42.793 --> 16:46.464
‐Olivia O'Brien.
‐Yeah.

16:46.464 --> 16:48.007
She did do that.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.055
No way.
This is one of those

16:54.055 --> 16:56.015
Jim Leeno
construction benches.

16:56.015 --> 16:59.268
He was my old boss,
the one I was
telling you about.

16:59.268 --> 17:00.937
You worked for Jim Leeno?

17:00.937 --> 17:03.272
Yeah, he was really
like a mentor to me.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.233
He taught me so much.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.443
That's a good
mentor to have.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.820
Wes is really great
at building stuff.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.699
So what's new
at Springtime Meadows?

17:13.699 --> 17:18.412
Oh, nothing much,
I suppose.

17:18.412 --> 17:21.582
I asked Cynthia
to be my sponsor.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.501
Did you? Hmm.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.836
‐And what does
that mean, exactly?
‐I don't know.

17:25.836 --> 17:28.214
I guess she helps me

17:28.214 --> 17:30.925
and she gives me
sober homework.

17:30.925 --> 17:32.635
Sponsors take you
through the steps.

17:32.635 --> 17:35.263
They're the person
you can talk to
about anything,

17:35.263 --> 17:37.974
someone you can
turn to for help or advice.

17:37.974 --> 17:40.309
You can tell them
everything,

17:40.309 --> 17:43.229
you know, all about
the resentments you have,
the people you've wronged.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.690
They help you through
the amends process.

17:45.690 --> 17:47.233
It's pretty cool, actually.

17:50.778 --> 17:53.864
So, you're going to
be sharing all of that
with Cynthia?

17:56.617 --> 17:58.536
I mean, she's your
guidance counselor.

17:58.536 --> 18:01.330
She's supposed to be
helping you get
into college.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.874
Your sponsor is your
school guidance counselor?

18:05.001 --> 18:06.794
That is weird.

18:13.467 --> 18:15.052
Hey.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.139
I got it.

18:18.139 --> 18:20.349
Okay. Whew!

18:20.349 --> 18:23.269
Man, this waitressing
thing is a bitch.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.271
Most of the time,
I just snorted it.

18:25.271 --> 18:28.065
I mean, I smoked it, too,
but just not as much.

18:28.065 --> 18:30.276
I thought you said
you wanted curry rice?

18:30.276 --> 18:33.112
No? Okay.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.364
How about some
jerked chicken?

18:35.364 --> 18:36.616
Yeah, let's do this.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.618
Now we got to get him
his ice cream on the house,

18:38.618 --> 18:40.620
because I‐‐
you messed me up.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.371
Wait, why am I
telling you this?

18:42.371 --> 18:44.332
Don't do drugs.

18:44.332 --> 18:46.417
Why don't you
just eat what you have?

18:46.417 --> 18:49.211
Not what they ordered.
You're wrong!

18:49.211 --> 18:51.130
Okay, here you go.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.426
Really, girl,
I did you a favor.

18:55.426 --> 18:57.803
I mean, mom jeans?
Come on!

18:57.803 --> 19:00.306
Don't give up on yourself.
You got a few good years left.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.141
Trish!

19:03.684 --> 19:06.354
It's not just
that she's falling behind.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.522
She's deliberately
disruptive.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.983
She's taking time away
from the other children

19:10.983 --> 19:12.735
and the work
they need to be doing.

19:12.735 --> 19:15.446
They're 9‐year‐olds.
What work could possibly
be so important?

19:15.446 --> 19:17.531
I know how upsetting
this must be.

19:17.531 --> 19:21.077
But we've received
several complaints
from parents already.

19:21.077 --> 19:23.371
‐Who's complaining?
‐That's not important.

19:23.371 --> 19:25.873
All we want is
for her to be evaluated

19:25.873 --> 19:27.625
by a district psychologist.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.251
And if medication
is the answer,

19:29.251 --> 19:31.379
which I strongly
believe it is,

19:31.379 --> 19:33.381
then you need
to be open to that

19:33.381 --> 19:35.007
if you want Trish
to remain here.

19:35.007 --> 19:38.219
So some psychiatrist
who can't get a job
anywhere else,

19:38.219 --> 19:40.221
except, of course,
this highly prestigious,

19:40.221 --> 19:42.306
ranked 47th in the nation
or whatever it is,

19:42.306 --> 19:44.350
California
public school system,

19:44.350 --> 19:46.352
wants to spend
an hour with my daughter

19:46.352 --> 19:48.354
and tell me I need
to medicate her?

19:48.354 --> 19:50.439
There isn't anything
wrong with Trish.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.274
You're the ones
who are crazy.

19:52.274 --> 19:54.860
You don't need to look
at this as a negative.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.113
Mom:
I guess there is
one positive thing.

19:57.113 --> 19:59.323
I get a chance
to tell you that you
are an arrogant,

19:59.323 --> 20:02.368
self‐righteous,
stuck‐up piece of‐‐

20:02.368 --> 20:05.246
You are the stupidest girl
I ever met in my whole life.

20:05.246 --> 20:07.373
‐What is your problem?
‐Hey, babe. Calm down.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.458
‐Come on.
‐Can't you do
anything right?

20:09.458 --> 20:11.043
No wonder
you can't find a job

20:11.043 --> 20:12.670
and I'm the only fool
who would hire you.

20:12.670 --> 20:16.048
Your daughter is lucky
she don't live with you.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.466
Just get out of here.

20:17.466 --> 20:20.886
Now! Get out now! Go!

20:25.349 --> 20:27.476
Thanks for introducing
me to your mom.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.687
‐She seems great.
‐She's all right, I guess.

20:29.687 --> 20:32.690
The way she supports you,
it's really cool.

20:32.690 --> 20:34.525
I guess it is.

20:34.525 --> 20:36.736
The only person
I have like that
is my grandma,

20:36.736 --> 20:38.404
but she's in
a nursing home now.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.156
I try to visit her
as much as I can.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.574
Is she the one
who raised you?

20:41.574 --> 20:43.534
I wish. She's super cool.

20:43.534 --> 20:46.412
She was this draft advisor
in the Vietnam war,

20:46.412 --> 20:48.998
and a civil rights activist,

20:48.998 --> 20:50.416
and this bad‐ass feminist.

20:50.416 --> 20:54.378
And you know
the <i>Give Peace</i>
<i>a Chance</i> video,

20:54.378 --> 20:57.548
with John and Yoko
and Tim Leary and stuff?

20:57.548 --> 21:00.092
You can actually
see her on stage.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.594
She's playing the tambourine.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.304
No way!
That's so awesome.

21:03.304 --> 21:07.266
I lived with her
those past six months
that I was sober.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.810
It's kind of the thing
that made it so great,
I guess.

21:09.810 --> 21:11.312
Where's the nursing home now?

21:11.312 --> 21:13.397
It's over on the east side.

21:13.397 --> 21:15.524
Well, let's go.

21:15.524 --> 21:18.194
‐Go where?
‐To see your grandma.

21:18.194 --> 21:19.945
‐Right now?
‐Yeah.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.405
‐Right now?
‐Right now!

21:21.405 --> 21:24.408
‐You met my mom.
I'll met her. Come on.
‐All right.

21:28.829 --> 21:30.581
This is absurd!

21:30.581 --> 21:32.500
I'm not in
a prison here, am I?

21:32.500 --> 21:33.542
Is this Attica?

21:33.542 --> 21:36.128
You going to call in
Governor Rockefeller?

21:36.128 --> 21:37.546
I don't even know
what that means.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.840
I just lost
one of my best friends.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.176
She's being buried
this afternoon.

21:42.176 --> 21:44.470
I cannot miss the funeral,

21:44.470 --> 21:46.430
and you can't
keep me from going.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.891
Uh, yes, ma'am, I can.

21:48.891 --> 21:50.559
All right,
I'm done talking to you.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.561
I'd like to speak to Janine.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.355
‐Ma'am‐‐
‐Right now!

21:54.355 --> 21:57.191
‐Ma'am‐‐
‐Attica! Attica!

21:57.191 --> 21:59.819
Grandma! Grandma,
Grandma, Grandma.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.446
‐Wes!
‐You okay?

22:02.446 --> 22:06.242
‐Yeah, well...
‐Grandma, this is Maddie.

22:06.242 --> 22:07.868
Maddie, this is
my Grandma Jane.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.954
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

22:09.954 --> 22:13.207
‐You are so beautiful.
‐Aw, thank you.

22:13.207 --> 22:15.167
So are you.

22:15.167 --> 22:18.379
And look!
She doesn't have
track marks.

22:18.379 --> 22:21.674
So glad to see
your tastes are improving.

22:21.674 --> 22:24.301
Thanks, Grandma.

22:27.930 --> 22:30.057
I don't know.

22:30.057 --> 22:33.644
I don't know.
She's just being weird.

22:33.644 --> 22:36.230
Yeah, I know.
She is.

22:36.230 --> 22:37.523
Yeah.

22:37.523 --> 22:39.733
But she did this
in tenth grade, too.

22:39.733 --> 22:43.487
Remember when
she was all into
Rebecca and reggae

22:43.487 --> 22:46.490
and was telling everyone
she was thinking
of becoming Wiccan?

22:46.490 --> 22:49.827
Hmm. She didn't disappear
for two whole weeks.

22:49.827 --> 22:51.579
I don't know.

22:51.579 --> 22:55.791
She just seems different.

22:55.791 --> 22:58.961
Body snatchers.

22:58.961 --> 23:01.463
Okay, you're going to
think this is stupid,

23:01.463 --> 23:04.633
but when she left last night,

23:04.633 --> 23:07.303
I decided to finish
her drink because...

23:07.303 --> 23:08.470
Both:
No booze left behind.

23:08.470 --> 23:11.223
And it was water.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.933
Okay.

23:12.933 --> 23:15.311
Nyla, she puts vodka
in her water bottle,

23:15.311 --> 23:16.645
not the other way around.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.480
You are
so Nancy Drew right now.

23:18.480 --> 23:21.650
I'm being serious
about this.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.153
Remember at
the movie theater,
how she was?

23:24.153 --> 23:25.988
What was that?

23:25.988 --> 23:27.615
Oh, my God, Elle.

23:27.615 --> 23:31.285
You're right! She changed!

23:31.285 --> 23:34.663
‐Body snatchers.
‐You're a bitch.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.624
I'm sure Maddie's fine, okay?

23:36.624 --> 23:38.459
If anything was going on,
she would have told me.

23:38.459 --> 23:40.085
I'm her best friend.

23:40.085 --> 23:41.879
As long as she's not
going Wiccan on us,

23:41.879 --> 23:44.089
I think we can deal.

23:55.309 --> 23:58.896
Hey, you didn't have to
yell at that girl like that.

23:58.896 --> 24:01.690
The hell I didn't.
She spilled everything,

24:01.690 --> 24:03.567
got all the orders wrong,
insulted the customers.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.694
She embarrassed me.

24:05.694 --> 24:07.321
I have to fight with you
to bring her on,

24:07.321 --> 24:08.656
and this is how
she repays me.

24:08.656 --> 24:10.407
Did you try telling her
what she was doing wrong

24:10.407 --> 24:11.909
before you started
screaming at her?

24:11.909 --> 24:13.744
No, she should have known.

24:13.744 --> 24:16.622
Maybe you gave her
to much responsibility
on her first day.

24:16.622 --> 24:17.957
Did you think of that?

24:17.957 --> 24:20.542
I gave her a chance,
but she blew it.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.211
Okay, you know what?
Whatever, Mom.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.505
You didn't need
to treat Trish like that.

24:24.505 --> 24:26.757
She's really trying.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.135
We don't try. We do.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.680
But everybody deserves
a second chance.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.351
Didn't we give that to you?

24:45.526 --> 24:47.403
Thank you.

24:47.403 --> 24:49.655
I'm already sponsoring
four other girls,

24:49.655 --> 24:53.450
and between all of them
they have a total of
26 years of sobriety.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.035
I know Maddie.

24:55.035 --> 24:57.329
I watched her grow up.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.873
I don't want to see her
make the same mistakes
that I did.

24:59.873 --> 25:02.751
But you're engaged
to the head of the school.

25:02.751 --> 25:04.712
Isn't that a conflict
of interest?

25:04.712 --> 25:07.589
I haven't had a problem
keeping the two things
separate so far.

25:07.589 --> 25:09.508
What makes you think
this would be any different?

25:09.508 --> 25:11.593
I want her to be able
to come to me

25:11.593 --> 25:13.137
with any issues
that she might have.

25:13.137 --> 25:14.888
I don't want her
talking to you about
her private life.

25:14.888 --> 25:16.557
It's our business.

25:16.557 --> 25:19.059
Maddie's recovery depends
on her being able to be
open and honest.

25:19.059 --> 25:21.395
Of course,
and I want her to have

25:21.395 --> 25:23.564
that kind of relationship
with her mother,

25:23.564 --> 25:25.357
not with her
guidance counselor.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.443
It's weird.

25:27.443 --> 25:29.903
I'm a sober woman
she looks up to.
It's perfectly normal.

25:29.903 --> 25:31.947
This was a huge‐‐
no, no,

25:31.947 --> 25:34.783
a monumental step for her.

25:34.783 --> 25:36.952
You should be proud
of the progress she's making.

25:36.952 --> 25:39.830
I am proud of her,
but she's still
a 17‐year‐old girl.

25:39.830 --> 25:41.415
She doesn't always know
what's best for her.

25:41.415 --> 25:42.624
I do. I'm her mother.

25:42.624 --> 25:44.585
I can appreciate that,

25:44.585 --> 25:47.212
but you still don't know
how the program works.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.298
I do. We discussed this.

25:49.298 --> 25:51.675
Sponsoring Maddie
was never part of the deal.

25:51.675 --> 25:54.720
There comes a point
where you have to
start letting go.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.848
Have you ever thought
about checking out
an Al‐Anon meeting?

25:57.848 --> 26:00.225
Addiction is
a family disease.

26:00.225 --> 26:02.686
This is not my problem.
I'm not the one
with a problem.

26:02.686 --> 26:05.606
You're exhibiting classic
co‐dependent behavior.

26:05.606 --> 26:08.108
Cynthia, I was working
when you called,

26:08.108 --> 26:09.777
and so I did not
give your question

26:09.777 --> 26:11.862
the full attention
that it deserved.

26:11.862 --> 26:13.739
But I am now,
and I am telling you

26:13.739 --> 26:14.948
that for
a multitude of reasons

26:14.948 --> 26:17.076
I am absolutely
not comfortable with this.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.787
After she finally
made a decision that might
help save her life?

26:19.787 --> 26:22.206
For heaven's sakes,
get over yourself.

26:24.666 --> 26:26.627
Fine, then I'll tell her
that you said no.

26:26.627 --> 26:28.003
‐Good. Tell her.
‐I will.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.296
Good.

26:36.345 --> 26:37.638
It's not like I'm asking them

26:37.638 --> 26:39.932
to let me go
base‐jumping off Everest.

26:39.932 --> 26:42.768
It's a funeral
at Bolan Cemetery.

26:42.768 --> 26:46.313
Grandma, it's probably
not safe for you.

26:46.313 --> 26:48.774
‐I mean, your health.
‐So what? I'm going to
live forever?

26:48.774 --> 26:50.484
What's the point?

26:50.484 --> 26:52.861
Some are buried,
some are born.

26:52.861 --> 26:55.906
One linked to the other,
the great circle of life.

26:55.906 --> 26:58.700
May I ask
whose funeral is it?

26:58.700 --> 27:01.453
And old friend
from way back.

27:01.453 --> 27:03.413
She died of lung cancer
of all things,

27:03.413 --> 27:04.915
although she was
a big pothead,

27:04.915 --> 27:05.958
so I guess it makes sense.

27:05.958 --> 27:09.128
But I should really be there.
This is ridiculous.

27:09.128 --> 27:10.838
The prisons
are overflowing,

27:10.838 --> 27:12.881
the schools
are filled with students.

27:12.881 --> 27:15.467
The world loves to keep
things locked up.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.511
It loves to throw
away the key.

27:18.804 --> 27:20.806
Why don't we take her?

27:20.806 --> 27:23.100
‐Vern has my car.
‐Oh, Wes.

27:23.100 --> 27:25.727
Someone in this place
must have a car
we can borrow.

27:25.727 --> 27:27.813
Well...

27:27.813 --> 27:30.566
Joe Ashby in the room
next door has a car.

27:35.946 --> 27:38.156
Grandpa, I missed you!

27:38.156 --> 27:40.200
Who the hell are you?

27:40.200 --> 27:42.327
Your granddaughter.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.496
My granddaughter's
35 years old.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.623
She lives in Cleveland.

27:46.623 --> 27:50.460
Oh, grandpa.
I'm going to borrow
your car, okay?

27:50.460 --> 27:52.379
‐My car?
‐Mm‐hmm.

27:54.381 --> 27:56.383
Thanks, Grandpa.

27:57.885 --> 28:00.846
There better not be
a scratch on it.

28:04.182 --> 28:05.809
You get it?

28:07.978 --> 28:10.230
You are a girl
after my own heart.

28:10.230 --> 28:11.857
‐Thanks.
‐here we go.

28:12.941 --> 28:14.610
‐We're out of here.
‐Right.

28:16.778 --> 28:18.238
Shh, shh, shh.

28:18.238 --> 28:20.657
‐Oh, gosh.
‐Hi.

28:29.416 --> 28:32.419
(rock music playing)

28:41.094 --> 28:43.722
(music continues on radio)

28:45.349 --> 28:48.226
What's the story
with you two?

28:48.226 --> 28:49.895
We're just friends,
Grandma.

28:49.895 --> 28:51.730
Oh, that's a shame.

28:51.730 --> 28:54.024
You need
a smart girl like her.

28:54.024 --> 28:56.526
And what's
the matter with you?

28:56.526 --> 28:58.612
You don't think
my grandson's cute?

28:58.612 --> 29:00.822
‐No, I do.
‐Grandma.

29:00.822 --> 29:03.867
‐I just‐‐
‐Don't cheat yourself
out of too much life.

29:03.867 --> 29:06.912
Everything passes away,
and too soon.

29:06.912 --> 29:08.914
Don't be afraid to try‐‐

29:08.914 --> 29:11.333
to get hurt, to be human.

29:12.542 --> 29:15.504
And to drive
a little faster, Wes.

29:15.504 --> 29:17.631
Thank you.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.641
‐(sobbing)
‐(knock on door)

29:29.267 --> 29:31.979
Just please leave, okay?

29:31.979 --> 29:33.939
I get it.
I can't do anything right.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.983
All right, all right.
Knock it off.

29:35.983 --> 29:37.234
I can't.

29:37.234 --> 29:39.903
‐What am I going to do?
‐I'm sorry!

29:42.030 --> 29:44.533
I was too hard on you.

29:44.533 --> 29:45.867
And if you'll come back

29:45.867 --> 29:48.161
I'll find something
else for you to do,

29:48.161 --> 29:51.957
something better suited
for your unique personality.

29:54.042 --> 29:56.420
Thank you!

29:58.964 --> 30:00.799
Thank you.

30:03.844 --> 30:06.722
...that He may bless
and deliver

30:06.722 --> 30:09.266
all souls of
the faithful departed

30:09.266 --> 30:11.435
from the pains of hell

30:11.435 --> 30:13.729
and the bottomless pit.

30:13.729 --> 30:18.066
Deliver them from
the lion's den, O Lord.

30:18.066 --> 30:20.027
Let us pray.

30:22.988 --> 30:27.951
‐She's really incredible.
‐Yeah. She is.

30:27.951 --> 30:31.038
So what happened?
Did she get sick
or something?

30:31.038 --> 30:35.042
No. It was my fault.

30:35.042 --> 30:37.753
I was doing really great,
going to meetings,

30:37.753 --> 30:40.255
working a great job,
doing everything
I was supposed to do.

30:40.255 --> 30:43.050
The one day I opened
the refrigerator

30:43.050 --> 30:46.678
and saw a bottle
of her pain meds.

30:46.678 --> 30:51.475
And I thought,
"I've been sober
six months now.

30:51.475 --> 30:55.062
"You know,
I've proved I can do it.

30:57.522 --> 31:00.150
Taking one Percocet's
not going to hurt."

31:00.150 --> 31:02.110
And that was it.

31:02.110 --> 31:04.654
It was like the drugs
were talking to me again,

31:04.654 --> 31:07.824
telling me I'd never
been happy without using,
never would be.

31:07.824 --> 31:11.244
So... I started
shooting dope again.

31:13.497 --> 31:15.791
And my grandma had
a pretty bad fall,

31:15.791 --> 31:17.834
had to go into
assisted living...

31:19.127 --> 31:20.754
and I went into
another detox.

31:20.754 --> 31:23.048
God, sorry.
It's too much information.

31:24.257 --> 31:26.343
You're not going back
to that, are you?

31:29.429 --> 31:31.556
I hope not.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.683
I'm coming up on
sixth months sober again.

31:33.683 --> 31:36.561
Can't mess it up this time,

31:36.561 --> 31:39.523
can't pull on
that loose thread.

31:39.523 --> 31:42.234
I wish I could make things
better for you.

31:43.318 --> 31:46.154
You do.

31:46.154 --> 31:47.572
You really, really do.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.786
I mean,
today has been great.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.753
Okay, we will see you
at seven. All right, thanks.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.880
Thank you so much
for coming in.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.092
Okay.

32:09.970 --> 32:12.973
‐Thanks.
‐Yeah, I'm sorry
about my mom.

32:12.973 --> 32:15.809
Her bark is worse
than her bite.

32:15.809 --> 32:18.270
I... guess that's not true.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.063
Still, she's making progress.

32:20.063 --> 32:22.440
She's even going to
anger management classes.

32:22.440 --> 32:26.736
They're court‐mandated,
but she's taking it seriously.

32:26.736 --> 32:28.613
Yeah, well, maybe
she should take them

32:28.613 --> 32:31.116
a little more seriously.

32:32.117 --> 32:35.036
And I also wanted to tell you

32:35.036 --> 32:36.872
that you should be
really proud of yourself.

32:36.872 --> 32:38.248
I know
you've overcome a lot,

32:38.248 --> 32:40.250
and I've seen how hard
it's been for my mom.

32:42.127 --> 32:43.587
Thank you.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.259
(ringing)

32:49.259 --> 32:51.219
You can't tell me
what to do because
I'm not a child.

32:51.219 --> 32:52.929
‐You are in no position...
‐Doesn't really matter.

32:52.929 --> 32:54.347
‐...to care for a baby.
‐How do you know that?

32:54.347 --> 32:56.183
‐Look at this place.
‐I am not a child.

32:56.183 --> 32:58.310
Girl, come here.
Come here!

32:58.310 --> 33:00.103
What, are you upset

33:00.103 --> 33:02.355
because for once
everything isn't
about you?

33:02.355 --> 33:04.065
‐Trish...
‐You don't know.

33:04.065 --> 33:08.069
‐You're mad?
‐There's something
wrong with you.

33:08.069 --> 33:10.113
‐No, no.
‐We're going to
get you out.

33:10.113 --> 33:12.490
‐No one cares!
‐A psychiatrist.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.201
‐I can't hear you.
‐We'll get you
on medication.

33:14.201 --> 33:16.244
Mom, you don't
know everything!

33:16.244 --> 33:19.664
You don't know!
I'm going to have this
baby on my own!

33:19.664 --> 33:21.583
You'll see!
I don't need you!

33:21.583 --> 33:23.251
I don't need anybody.

33:31.718 --> 33:33.345
Maddie:
Can I tell you
something stupid?

33:35.222 --> 33:37.224
When I was little,

33:37.224 --> 33:39.351
I used to think
that I was an alien,

33:39.351 --> 33:42.062
that I'd been dropped off
on this planet by mistake,

33:42.062 --> 33:44.356
and...

33:44.356 --> 33:47.943
the reason I never
felt the same
as other people

33:47.943 --> 33:50.445
was because
I was actually
from outer space.

33:50.445 --> 33:55.242
You know what?
Maybe we're both
from the same planet.

33:55.242 --> 33:56.993
Seriously.
Maybe we are,

33:56.993 --> 33:58.870
but maybe
it wasn't a mistake.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.873
Maybe we're supposed to find
other aliens like us.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.833
Seriously.

34:05.502 --> 34:07.420
Maybe we are.

34:10.674 --> 34:13.927
Aww. That's so sweet.

34:13.927 --> 34:15.637
Look at the way
she's comforting
that poor man

34:15.637 --> 34:17.138
who lost his wife.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.478
Oh.

34:29.234 --> 34:32.988
She is, uh,
really comforting him.

34:34.656 --> 34:36.074
Oh, my gosh.

34:44.499 --> 34:46.209
This all sounds great.

34:46.209 --> 34:49.462
Really. You've made
your sponsor very proud.

34:49.462 --> 34:52.340
Yeah, at first
Margarita was really mean,

34:52.340 --> 34:55.302
but then she apologized,
so I was like, "Okay, fine.

34:55.302 --> 34:57.387
I'll come back to work."
And then I did.

34:57.387 --> 35:00.140
And she's like, "Wow!
You're doing so much
better at this."

35:00.140 --> 35:03.101
And I'm like,
"I totally am!"

35:03.101 --> 35:05.228
This is so good, Trish.

35:05.228 --> 35:08.732
You've started this job,
you've been sober six months,

35:08.732 --> 35:10.734
you spent the afternoon
with your daughter last week.

35:10.734 --> 35:14.279
I'm just so happy
with the progress
that you're making.

35:14.279 --> 35:15.905
Have you told your mom
about the job yet?

35:17.198 --> 35:21.870
No, but‐‐ oh, my God.

35:21.870 --> 35:24.456
Do you think this means
I can get more
visitation rights?

35:24.456 --> 35:28.001
‐Like, unsupervised?
‐Well, no. Probably
not just yet.

35:28.001 --> 35:29.419
But it's a good start.

35:29.419 --> 35:31.504
You should definitely
call your lawyer
and let him know‐‐

35:31.504 --> 35:35.342
This is perfect.
I'm going to talk to my mom
about it after my shift.

35:35.342 --> 35:37.135
Oh, my God.

36:21.721 --> 36:23.515
Wes:
Here you go, Grandma.

36:23.515 --> 36:24.849
Thank you.

36:24.849 --> 36:28.103
Don't you want to go
live with that man
you're in love with

36:28.103 --> 36:29.813
now that you can
finally be together?

36:29.813 --> 36:31.356
Who says I'm in love
with him?

36:31.356 --> 36:33.149
But you don't want
to go back to
this place, do you?

36:33.149 --> 36:34.567
You said
it's like a prison.

36:34.567 --> 36:36.361
It can be, sure.

36:37.862 --> 36:40.573
There's something
to knowing where you belong,

36:40.573 --> 36:42.492
and this is where
I belong right now.

36:45.412 --> 36:46.496
Besides which,
it's poker night,

36:46.496 --> 36:49.124
and that bitch Betty
took me for 500 bucks
last week.

36:49.124 --> 36:50.875
‐I'm on to her now.
‐Come on, Grandma.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.168
‐She cheats! I got her.
‐Come on.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.509
‐What's this?
‐Ackee and saltfish.

37:01.261 --> 37:02.387
Your favorite.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.180
You made this for me?

37:04.180 --> 37:06.975
I made this, yes.

37:06.975 --> 37:08.810
Why?

37:08.810 --> 37:11.354
Because you were right.

37:12.731 --> 37:16.317
You gave me
a second chance,
and I'm grateful.

37:16.317 --> 37:20.613
And... I'm sorry.

37:36.004 --> 37:37.380
Hey, Maddie.

37:37.380 --> 37:39.632
Sorry to come by so late,
it's just‐‐

37:39.632 --> 37:41.968
‐Do you have a second?
‐Sure. Yeah.

37:41.968 --> 37:43.386
Okay.

37:44.679 --> 37:46.848
And I've got
something for you.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.394
Wow.

37:52.353 --> 37:57.317
‐I am impressed.
‐I had a good day today,
you know?

37:58.568 --> 38:00.528
It was only one day,
but still.

38:00.528 --> 38:02.155
That's what sobriety
is all about.

38:02.155 --> 38:04.908
You can't change the past
and you can't
predict the future.

38:04.908 --> 38:07.535
So all you've got
is today.

38:07.535 --> 38:08.995
It's putting
those days together

38:08.995 --> 38:11.456
one day at a time
that makes up a whole life.

38:11.456 --> 38:13.500
I'm willing
to give it a try.

38:13.500 --> 38:16.169
I mean,
at least for now.

38:16.169 --> 38:19.339
I really proud of you,
but...

38:20.924 --> 38:25.220
I talked to your mom
and she's not comfortable
with me sponsoring you.

38:25.220 --> 38:27.639
‐What?
‐I‐‐ I'm sorry.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.140
What? Why?

38:29.140 --> 38:32.977
I think maybe
she feels threatened or‐‐

38:32.977 --> 38:35.230
I don't know.
It's complicated.

38:35.230 --> 38:37.482
But it's not
up to my mom.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.359
It's up to me, right?
This is about me.

38:39.359 --> 38:42.403
Yeah, you're right.
You are totally right.

38:42.403 --> 38:43.905
This is messed up.

38:46.741 --> 38:49.452
Okay, how about‐‐

38:49.452 --> 38:54.499
what if I agreed to be
your temporary sponsor...

38:55.750 --> 38:57.669
until you can find someone?

38:57.669 --> 39:00.421
What do you mean?
For how long?

39:00.421 --> 39:02.549
As long as it takes.
Indefinitely.

39:02.549 --> 39:04.384
We'll say that you're
my interim sponsor.

39:04.384 --> 39:05.969
What do you think?
How does that sound?

39:08.847 --> 39:11.391
‐Okay, I guess.
‐Good.

39:11.391 --> 39:14.102
Great! Perfect!

39:14.102 --> 39:18.356
Only maybe just
don't tell your mom
right now.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.941
Fine.

39:21.150 --> 39:23.403
(doorbell rings)

39:35.540 --> 39:37.625
‐How'd you get
past the gate?
‐Where's Wes?

39:37.625 --> 39:40.628
Hey, do you know this guy?
Is everything okay?

39:40.628 --> 39:42.422
‐He's a dealer.
‐I'm looking for Wes.

39:42.422 --> 39:44.591
‐Where is Craig?
‐I know he's here,
all right?

39:44.591 --> 39:46.509
Sorry, dude,
you've got to go.

39:46.509 --> 39:49.053
It's okay.
Let him in. Let him in.

39:49.053 --> 39:50.805
You want me
to call the police?

39:52.891 --> 39:55.643
No, it's okay.
This is Asa.

39:55.643 --> 39:56.978
He's my brother.

39:58.605 --> 40:00.023
So you going to
talk to me now

40:00.023 --> 40:01.357
or keep on hiding
like a little bitch?

40:01.357 --> 40:02.609
I'm right here.

40:03.568 --> 40:05.320
Mom's back.
She wants to see you.

40:05.320 --> 40:06.654
Well, I don't want
to see her.

40:06.654 --> 40:08.656
She wants to know
who has Grandma's
power of attorney.

40:08.656 --> 40:10.700
‐What for?
‐Do you know
where she is?

40:13.411 --> 40:14.913
‐No.
‐Come on, man.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.456
I know you visit her.

40:16.456 --> 40:17.624
You were always
her favorite.

40:17.624 --> 40:18.583
I don't know
where she is.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.209
Stop lying to me.

40:20.209 --> 40:21.920
(door opens)

40:23.004 --> 40:24.589
My daughter is missing!

40:25.882 --> 40:29.844
She's missing!
She's missing!

40:29.844 --> 40:32.764
My little girl
is missing!

40:34.182 --> 40:36.434
Help me.

40:48.738 --> 40:50.740
‐(music playing)
‐(no audible dialog)
