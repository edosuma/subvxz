WEBVTT

00:03.738 --> 00:05.140
Bring in the helo now.

00:06.608 --> 00:08.043
(shouting)

00:17.086 --> 00:18.753
(helicopter blades whirring)

00:23.492 --> 00:25.094
Go! I got this!

00:25.127 --> 00:27.229
Get the kids
to the chopper!

00:32.767 --> 00:34.536
RICARDO: Enrique!
Papa!

00:34.569 --> 00:36.738
All right, come on.
Come on!
(shouting in Spanish)

00:39.174 --> 00:40.709
Come on, kid...

00:42.111 --> 00:44.279
(shouting in Spanish)

00:44.313 --> 00:45.514
Get out of here!

00:45.547 --> 00:47.216
All right, take off.

00:48.650 --> 00:49.651
Nick, you got 'em.

00:49.684 --> 00:50.752
Tim, what are you doing?

00:50.785 --> 00:52.087
Tim!

00:52.121 --> 00:54.089
(gunfire continuing)

00:59.128 --> 01:00.362
Turn around!

01:00.395 --> 01:01.663
That's a negative.

01:01.696 --> 01:03.265
We left men on the ground!

01:03.298 --> 01:04.733
Copy that,
but we don't have the fuel.

01:04.766 --> 01:06.601
I'm giving you an order.
We're going back!

01:06.635 --> 01:08.470
I don't take orders
from you, sir.

01:11.473 --> 01:12.574
I'm not gonna tell you again.

01:12.607 --> 01:14.543
Turn this damn bird around.

01:16.411 --> 01:18.713
*

01:46.808 --> 01:49.178
I'd love to take you
for lunch, sweets,

01:49.211 --> 01:51.346
although I've got
to check with the boss first.

01:51.380 --> 01:52.847
I wouldn't hold my breath.

01:52.881 --> 01:54.283
I've worked with lion trainers
that didn't

01:54.316 --> 01:55.517
crack the whip
as much as this one.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.286
Oh, wish me luck.

01:57.319 --> 01:58.753
Here she comes.

01:58.787 --> 02:00.155
Okay, that's it,
I am done

02:00.189 --> 02:01.290
signing things
for the day.

02:01.323 --> 02:02.457
Is this bad timing?

02:02.491 --> 02:04.159
(sighs) You know,
I don't remember

02:04.193 --> 02:05.694
Gibbs having to deal with

02:05.727 --> 02:07.429
quite this much paperwork.

02:07.462 --> 02:09.731
That's because
he used it for kindling.

02:09.764 --> 02:11.333
Ha.
No, really.

02:11.366 --> 02:12.734
The first steak
he ever grilled for me

02:12.767 --> 02:15.437
was roasted over
our fitness evals.

02:15.470 --> 02:16.838
Okay, now I am...
Thanks.

02:16.871 --> 02:19.174
Signing off
on my expense report?

02:19.208 --> 02:21.443
(sighs)
And how do you feel

02:21.476 --> 02:23.578
about me having an early lunch?

02:23.612 --> 02:25.880
Well, that depends
on whether you finished

02:25.914 --> 02:27.416
checking with
that source in Paraguay.

02:27.449 --> 02:29.718
I was up all night
working on it.

02:29.751 --> 02:31.453
Please tell me
you got something.

02:31.486 --> 02:33.188
No. Unfortunately.

02:33.222 --> 02:34.723
No new chatter
on Gibbs or McGee.

02:34.756 --> 02:37.426
What? There's new chatter
on Gibbs and McGee?

02:37.459 --> 02:38.460
Did I say "chatter"?

02:38.493 --> 02:39.861
Yeah, there's no chatter.

02:39.894 --> 02:41.296
And we're not looking.

02:41.330 --> 02:42.631
Everybody knows the DoD

02:42.664 --> 02:44.366
has forbidden anybody from NCIS

02:44.399 --> 02:46.868
getting involved in the
search for Gibbs or McGee.

02:54.276 --> 02:55.744
So, what's up?

02:55.777 --> 02:57.246
Who let you out of dispatch?

02:57.279 --> 02:59.614
Me. I just got
the strangest call.

02:59.648 --> 03:01.350
Figured you should
hear for yourself.

03:01.383 --> 03:04.353
NCIS.
How may I direct your call?

03:04.386 --> 03:07.656
MAN: I need to talk
to an agent... (grunts)
(gunshots, glass shattering)

03:07.689 --> 03:08.957
I've got an address.
It's a pay phone

03:08.990 --> 03:10.525
on Hamilton.
What do you think?

03:10.559 --> 03:12.461
I think I won't be having
an early lunch.

03:12.494 --> 03:14.696
Grab your gear.

03:14.729 --> 03:16.698
TORRES:
The pilot and I

03:16.731 --> 03:19.801
discussed turning back
for Agents Gibbs and McGee.

03:19.834 --> 03:21.503
But, um...

03:21.536 --> 03:24.306
well... we decided against it.

03:24.339 --> 03:27.376
As soon as we landed
on the LPD,

03:27.409 --> 03:29.611
Agent Taggart, in Paraguay,
asked the local police

03:29.644 --> 03:33.482
to send a team
to search for our men.

03:33.515 --> 03:34.883
But they didn't find anything.

03:34.916 --> 03:37.319
No.
And that's because

03:37.352 --> 03:39.288
the Revolutionary Armed

03:39.321 --> 03:41.756
Council rebels
you antagonized...

03:41.790 --> 03:43.458
That's one way to put it.

03:43.492 --> 03:47.329
...disappeared into the wind
after your attack.

03:47.362 --> 03:48.563
You're aware the R.A.C.

03:48.597 --> 03:51.366
was trafficking
black market uranium.

03:51.400 --> 03:55.036
And you set a CIA intel
gathering operation

03:55.069 --> 03:56.605
back months.

03:56.638 --> 03:58.673
Oh, and we also saved
the lives of three children.

03:58.707 --> 04:02.344
Violating seven DoD rules
of conduct.

04:02.377 --> 04:03.612
With all due respect,

04:03.645 --> 04:05.414
your rules of conduct suck.

04:05.447 --> 04:07.816
CONGRESSMAN: This committee
will not tolerate a rogue agency

04:07.849 --> 04:11.820
conducting rogue operations
in a foreign country.

04:11.853 --> 04:13.355
Well, if you want to get judgy.

04:13.388 --> 04:14.556
What I want

04:14.589 --> 04:16.758
is accountability.

04:16.791 --> 04:19.494
And a respect for
the rule of law.

04:19.528 --> 04:20.762
Maybe we should spend
a little more time

04:20.795 --> 04:22.397
talking about
my missing friends.

04:22.431 --> 04:24.699
CONGRESSWOMAN:
We do sympathize, Agent Torres.

04:24.733 --> 04:27.902
And the Paraguayan government
has vowed to do all they can

04:27.936 --> 04:29.704
to find our agents.

04:29.738 --> 04:31.840
And they're taking
their sweet time.

04:31.873 --> 04:33.842
Time we don't have.

04:33.875 --> 04:36.978
CONGRESSWOMAN: Sadly, there
might not be anything to find.

04:37.011 --> 04:38.513
And at some
point we need

04:38.547 --> 04:41.516
to ask ourselves
if Agent Gibbs and McGee

04:41.550 --> 04:43.051
are still alive.

04:46.555 --> 04:49.057
(guard speaking Spanish)

04:54.729 --> 04:56.665
Cena.

04:59.701 --> 05:02.036
(water dripping)

05:08.910 --> 05:10.379
Boss.

05:25.262 --> 05:25.896
(siren wailing,
helicopter blades whirring)

05:25.929 --> 05:27.598
So, what's this thing again?

05:27.631 --> 05:29.400
I don't know.

05:29.433 --> 05:31.335
But it does look
vaguely familiar.

05:31.368 --> 05:33.070
It's called
a phone booth.

05:33.104 --> 05:34.271
And they were everywhere,

05:34.305 --> 05:35.472
before cell phones

05:35.506 --> 05:36.740
became ubiquitous.

05:36.773 --> 05:38.542
People used them
any time

05:38.575 --> 05:40.611
they were away from
home to make calls.

05:40.644 --> 05:41.812
Like animals.

05:41.845 --> 05:43.547
WITNESS:
Suddenly this car

05:43.580 --> 05:46.083
comes flying out of nowhere,
and then bam, bam, bam!

05:46.117 --> 05:48.085
Glass shatters,
people are screaming.

05:48.119 --> 05:50.221
It was awesome.
I'll bet.

05:50.254 --> 05:52.189
Shame more people
weren't killed.

05:52.223 --> 05:54.158
So, uh, what happens next?

05:54.191 --> 05:57.261
Hair fibers, fingerprints,
trace the call?

05:57.294 --> 05:58.462
No need to.

05:58.495 --> 05:59.563
He called us.

05:59.596 --> 06:01.198
About what?

06:01.232 --> 06:03.534
That's what we're here
to find out, mate.

06:04.901 --> 06:07.304
What'd I miss?
JIMMY:
Hey!

06:07.338 --> 06:08.172
Nice suit.

06:08.205 --> 06:10.174
I didn't think
you even owned a tie.

06:10.207 --> 06:11.408
He doesn't.

06:11.442 --> 06:13.110
Mustard? Really?

06:13.144 --> 06:14.345
This is silk.

06:14.378 --> 06:15.812
Sorry, man,
I had a hot dog on the Hill.

06:16.880 --> 06:18.715
Who's this guy?

06:18.749 --> 06:20.184
Well, no ID yet.

06:20.217 --> 06:22.553
How'd the hearing go?
A lot of talking.

06:22.586 --> 06:24.421
They want to talk to Quinn;
I told them she was on leave

06:24.455 --> 06:25.622
and she was taking care
of her mom,

06:25.656 --> 06:27.124
but they didn't care.

06:27.158 --> 06:28.659
Anything from our contact
in Paraguay?

06:28.692 --> 06:30.261
JIMMY:
No, but I did speak to Delilah

06:30.294 --> 06:32.463
this morning, and, well, uh...

06:32.496 --> 06:33.830
she's not doing well.

06:33.864 --> 06:36.367
Pregnancy is supposed to be
a joyous time.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.869
I cannot imagine
what she must be going through.

06:38.902 --> 06:41.405
All right, well,
we will find them.

06:41.438 --> 06:42.906
We will.

06:42.939 --> 06:45.376
But right now,
we've got a job to do, so...

06:45.409 --> 06:47.244
I've got a partial plate
from a witness.

06:47.278 --> 06:48.745
DUCKY:
Cursory examination

06:48.779 --> 06:51.248
suggests that this
man was killed by

06:51.282 --> 06:52.683
multiple...

06:52.716 --> 06:54.185
Duck?

06:54.218 --> 06:55.819
Look.

06:55.852 --> 06:56.920
JIMMY:
Huh.

06:56.953 --> 06:58.822
It's just falling out.

06:58.855 --> 07:00.657
I've seen a lot of drive-bys
in my time,

07:00.691 --> 07:04.161
but I've never seen a shooter
shoot the hair off of somebody.

07:04.195 --> 07:06.129
Yeah, neither have I.

07:09.600 --> 07:10.734
McGEE:
Right, that's 31 for you,

07:10.767 --> 07:12.836
31 for me,

07:12.869 --> 07:14.471
and there's
one left over.

07:15.972 --> 07:17.641
You want to split it in half?

07:18.875 --> 07:20.344
It's a bean.

07:22.513 --> 07:23.680
Cheers.

07:25.749 --> 07:27.851
Oh, what I wouldn't give
for a real meal right now.

07:27.884 --> 07:31.188
(chuckles)
Nice shower.

07:31.222 --> 07:32.689
Oh.

07:32.723 --> 07:35.192
And a smartphone.

07:35.226 --> 07:37.428
Just for five minutes,
a smartphone would be nice.

07:37.461 --> 07:39.296
Check the weather,

07:39.330 --> 07:40.797
take a few selfies.

07:41.865 --> 07:43.600
(Gibbs grunts, can clatters)

07:43.634 --> 07:45.436
Oh, that's never gonna work.

07:45.469 --> 07:48.239
(sighs)
We need a knife. Oh.

07:48.272 --> 07:49.606
That's on the list

07:49.640 --> 07:51.208
of what I've recently renamed

07:51.242 --> 07:53.944
"The World's Slowest Moving
Escape Plan."

07:53.977 --> 07:55.646
(man speaks Spanish)

07:55.679 --> 07:57.414
(man whistles)
GIBBS: It just got harder.

07:59.916 --> 08:01.718
Lots of new faces.

08:01.752 --> 08:03.620
There's something going on...
(loud bang on door)

08:08.559 --> 08:10.627
Feliz Navidad.

08:10.661 --> 08:12.563
Good news.

08:12.596 --> 08:14.931
Christmas has come early
for you two.

08:16.533 --> 08:18.635
Time to meet Santa.

08:18.669 --> 08:20.937
McGEE: Santa gonna let us
sit on his lap?

08:20.971 --> 08:23.974
GUARD:
Not Santa. Jefe, the boss.

08:24.007 --> 08:25.809
He's been laying low
since your attack.

08:25.842 --> 08:27.544
Now he's back.

08:27.578 --> 08:30.013
He wants to have a little chat.

08:30.046 --> 08:31.982
You killed a
lot of people

08:32.015 --> 08:34.918
when you attacked
our training compound.

08:34.951 --> 08:37.754
Cost him a lot of money.

08:37.788 --> 08:39.623
Now it's time
to pay the piper.

08:39.656 --> 08:42.659
I can't wait to watch.

08:42.693 --> 08:44.828
Maybe he wants to
keep you in there, huh?

08:48.064 --> 08:49.600
Vamos.

08:49.633 --> 08:50.801
Ándale.

08:53.670 --> 08:55.806
REEVES: Our victim
has been identified

08:55.839 --> 08:57.808
as Zachary Brooks,
35 years old

08:57.841 --> 09:00.777
with a history of drug muling.

09:00.811 --> 09:03.480
(clears throat)
Sorry.

09:03.514 --> 09:05.349
(clears throat)

09:05.382 --> 09:06.417
Brooks has had
several convictions

09:06.450 --> 09:07.951
over the last decade,

09:07.984 --> 09:11.355
specializing
in overseas transports.

09:11.388 --> 09:12.556
And not in the Navy.

09:12.589 --> 09:14.491
Victim did call us.

09:14.525 --> 09:16.893
Cause of death?
Ducky confirms

09:16.927 --> 09:18.762
it was the three bullet holes.
He also figured out

09:18.795 --> 09:19.963
why his hair was falling out.

09:19.996 --> 09:21.898
Bloke had radiation poisoning.

09:21.932 --> 09:22.899
From what?

09:22.933 --> 09:24.635
Um, radiation?

09:26.837 --> 09:28.372
Abby is identifying
the source as we speak.

09:28.405 --> 09:29.706
(sighs)

09:29.740 --> 09:31.007
That's all you got?

09:32.709 --> 09:33.810
Floor time.

09:33.844 --> 09:34.845
No. Please.
Oh.

09:34.878 --> 09:35.979
That is an order.

09:36.012 --> 09:37.648
(sighs)

09:40.451 --> 09:41.785
(groans)
Okay.

09:41.818 --> 09:44.421
Why no arrests in
the past year? Go.

09:44.455 --> 09:45.722
I don't know,
maybe the guy went clean.

09:45.756 --> 09:47.324
Got better
at covering his tracks.

09:47.358 --> 09:48.692
Motive for his murder?

09:48.725 --> 09:50.461
I mean, timing is suspicious.

09:50.494 --> 09:51.862
Just as he was calling NCIS.

09:53.129 --> 09:55.999
Maybe someone was trying
to shut him up.

09:56.032 --> 09:59.336
You know, we should be hitting
this floor more often.

09:59.370 --> 10:00.103
ABBY:
Well,

10:00.136 --> 10:01.738
don't get up now because

10:01.772 --> 10:03.707
you're gonna want to sit down
when you hear this.

10:03.740 --> 10:05.842
Um, I was able
to find the source

10:05.876 --> 10:07.811
of your victim's
radiation poisoning.

10:07.844 --> 10:09.012
It's uranium.

10:09.045 --> 10:11.482
And it's not just
any uranium.

10:11.515 --> 10:13.450
When you analyze
the ratio between

10:13.484 --> 10:14.885
U-235

10:14.918 --> 10:16.553
and U-238...

10:16.587 --> 10:17.954
It's the same ratio

10:17.988 --> 10:20.624
as the sample we have
from the R.A.C.

10:20.657 --> 10:22.359
Brooks wasn't smuggling drugs,

10:22.393 --> 10:24.094
he was smuggling their uranium.

10:24.127 --> 10:26.363
Which means he had contact
with them.

10:26.397 --> 10:28.499
Maybe that's why
Brooks was calling us.

10:28.532 --> 10:30.501
He has info on Gibbs and McGee.

10:30.534 --> 10:31.502
Where is Director Vance?

10:31.535 --> 10:32.736
At the hearing.

10:32.769 --> 10:35.606
Well, we need to get
in touch with him now.

10:38.409 --> 10:40.377
(guard speaking Spanish)

10:40.411 --> 10:42.413
(Spanish music playing)

10:48.919 --> 10:51.087
(music turns off)

10:53.023 --> 10:55.459
What happened
with their clothing?

10:55.492 --> 10:57.561
And his face?

10:57.594 --> 10:58.862
We had a little fun with them

10:58.895 --> 11:00.531
while you were away.

11:03.867 --> 11:05.802
Ah, gentlemen, please,

11:05.836 --> 11:09.540
accept my humble apologies
for your mistreatment.

11:09.573 --> 11:11.675
I absolutely did
not authorize it.

11:12.743 --> 11:15.011
I can see why you
chose this weapon.

11:15.045 --> 11:17.548
Nice balance to it.

11:17.581 --> 11:19.950
We friends now?

11:19.983 --> 11:22.419
Well...

11:22.453 --> 11:25.155
clearly my men are still upset.

11:25.188 --> 11:28.024
You killed so many
of their comrades.

11:28.058 --> 11:29.993
But yes.

11:30.026 --> 11:31.695
Let's be friends.

11:31.728 --> 11:35.832
I'm willing to let
bygones be bygones

11:35.866 --> 11:38.068
for a price.

11:40.203 --> 11:41.137
Oh, my God.

11:41.171 --> 11:42.906
(laughs)
Where is my manners?

11:42.939 --> 11:45.476
You must be starving, huh?

11:45.509 --> 11:47.878
No, not hungry.

11:47.911 --> 11:49.145
(chuckles lightly)

11:49.179 --> 11:51.014
What's the price?

11:51.047 --> 11:53.584
Well...

11:53.617 --> 11:55.151
you cost me a lot of money.

11:55.185 --> 11:59.022
Lucky for you,
I imagine you know

11:59.055 --> 12:00.924
a lot of things...

12:00.957 --> 12:03.927
Agent Gibbs.

12:03.960 --> 12:07.097
So, I propose to
recoup my loss

12:07.130 --> 12:09.866
by selling those things.

12:09.900 --> 12:12.869
You can help me willingly
or I will just

12:12.903 --> 12:15.572
have to, uh...

12:15.606 --> 12:19.710
shall we say, uh, persuade you.

12:21.878 --> 12:25.181
Well, persuasion it is, then.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.486
I think you owe
this committee an answer,

12:29.520 --> 12:32.122
Director Vance.
I think I'm answering...

12:32.155 --> 12:33.790
All due respect to my colleague
across the aisle...

12:33.824 --> 12:35.759
I'm more than happy to...
...I will not allow you

12:35.792 --> 12:37.894
to turn this into
a witch hunt.

12:37.928 --> 12:39.162
I'm simply asking

12:39.195 --> 12:41.532
on what rule of engagement

12:41.565 --> 12:43.667
the director authorized

12:43.700 --> 12:45.902
this mission to Paraguay
when he...

12:45.936 --> 12:47.938
Mission was humanitarian.

12:47.971 --> 12:50.707
Proceed.

12:50.741 --> 12:53.644
Children were in danger.

12:53.677 --> 12:55.879
Agents Gibbs and McGee
saved them.

12:55.912 --> 12:57.781
And might I remind
this committee

12:57.814 --> 12:59.916
that they are now the ones
who need to be saved.

12:59.950 --> 13:01.685
The State Department
is doing all it can...

13:01.718 --> 13:02.886
The State Department?

13:02.919 --> 13:04.054
Two of my men are missing.

13:04.087 --> 13:06.690
Agent McGee is
about to become a father.

13:06.723 --> 13:09.926
We need all hands on deck,
and yet you've tied mine.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.028
CONGRESSWOMAN:
And as you know, your agency

13:12.062 --> 13:14.565
is recused from anything
Paraguay-related

13:14.598 --> 13:18.068
due to your feckless disregard
for diplomatic protocol.

13:18.101 --> 13:21.204
But that's not enough...
And if you happen upon

13:21.237 --> 13:23.974
any leads concerning
that rebel group,

13:24.007 --> 13:26.710
you are to turn
it over to DoD.

13:26.743 --> 13:28.545
Is that clear?

13:28.579 --> 13:29.913
Crystal.

13:34.985 --> 13:37.087
Is that something
you'd like to share

13:37.120 --> 13:39.055
with the committee,
Director?

13:39.089 --> 13:41.958
No, it's a personal matter.

13:48.067 --> 13:49.168
Sitrep.

13:49.202 --> 13:50.403
Is the hearing over already?

13:50.436 --> 13:52.772
No, I told them I had to take
a recess for a personal matter.

13:52.806 --> 13:54.741
Aka he lied under oath.

13:54.774 --> 13:56.776
No, I didn't.
It i personal.

13:56.810 --> 13:57.977
This is the first lead
we've had on the R.A.C.

13:58.011 --> 13:59.145
since Gibbs and McGee
went missing.

13:59.178 --> 14:00.914
I have no intention
of letting it go.

14:00.947 --> 14:03.149
You're assuming
they're still alive?

14:03.182 --> 14:04.651
They are alive.

14:06.853 --> 14:09.956
Have you IDed
the shooter yet?

14:09.989 --> 14:11.190
Well, the plate number we got

14:11.224 --> 14:12.726
from the eyewitness
is a dead end,

14:12.759 --> 14:15.061
but we were able to
make some progress

14:15.094 --> 14:16.863
on the victim.

14:16.896 --> 14:19.265
Uh, DHS said he's made several
recent trips to Paraguay.

14:19.298 --> 14:22.836
Where he used his drug courier
skills to smuggle uranium

14:22.869 --> 14:25.872
the old-fashioned way.

14:25.905 --> 14:29.042
Intestinal trauma
suggests he repeatedly

14:29.075 --> 14:32.345
hid foreign objects
in his rectal cavity.

14:32.378 --> 14:34.213
Aah, that's got to hurt.

14:34.247 --> 14:35.649
In many ways.

14:35.682 --> 14:37.717
Continual exposure

14:37.751 --> 14:40.219
caused the radiation poisoning.

14:40.253 --> 14:42.789
This guy's just
the courier.

14:42.822 --> 14:44.023
We need to find his boss.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.692
He knows how to
contact the R.A.C.

14:45.725 --> 14:48.327
We're retracing Brooks's steps
the night before the murder.

14:48.361 --> 14:50.196
Torres is running down
the cell records.

14:50.229 --> 14:51.197
Reeves has credit cards.

14:51.230 --> 14:52.966
And then there's this.

14:58.672 --> 14:59.906
BISHOP: So, we think it's
for some kind of nightclub,

14:59.939 --> 15:01.374
but we haven't been
able to ID it yet.

15:01.407 --> 15:03.810
JIMMY:
Oh, that's easy.

15:03.843 --> 15:07.046
That's Club Mouth on
Dickens. (chuckles)

15:07.080 --> 15:08.982
What?

15:09.015 --> 15:11.250
You guys, I have a life.

15:13.419 --> 15:14.721
TORRES:
Is this Palmer's lead?

15:14.754 --> 15:16.122
Yeah, he knew
the handstamp by sight.

15:16.155 --> 15:18.057
(phone ringing)

15:18.091 --> 15:20.093
Oh, it's Delilah.

15:20.126 --> 15:22.361
You gonna answer it?
And say what?

15:22.395 --> 15:24.197
That we have a lead
on her husband.

15:24.230 --> 15:26.700
Ugh, and admit ignoring orders

15:26.733 --> 15:28.201
from federal oversight committee

15:28.234 --> 15:30.103
on an unsecured line? No.

15:32.171 --> 15:34.207
Uh... (groans)

15:34.240 --> 15:35.274
Hey, Delilah.

15:35.308 --> 15:37.711
Time for my quad-daily check-in.

15:37.744 --> 15:39.145
Any updates for me?

15:39.178 --> 15:42.015
Um... uh, about what?

15:42.048 --> 15:43.683
About my missing husband?

15:43.717 --> 15:46.152
Uh, y-you know,

15:46.185 --> 15:48.354
we haven't heard anything
from State

15:48.387 --> 15:52.158
because, as you know,
NCIS has been told to stand down

15:52.191 --> 15:54.027
from-from our investigation,

15:54.060 --> 15:57.196
so we wouldn't have
any leads ourselves.

15:57.230 --> 15:58.164
I see.

15:58.197 --> 15:59.799
Real smooth.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.367
Uh, but if I do
hear something...

16:01.400 --> 16:02.769
Oh, I'll be the first to know.

16:02.802 --> 16:04.704
As always.

16:04.738 --> 16:06.239
Anyways, uh, I got to go.

16:06.272 --> 16:08.207
Day job. Bye.

16:09.876 --> 16:11.310
I'm glad you're
a good guy.

16:11.344 --> 16:13.179
You would make a
terrible bad one.

16:13.212 --> 16:14.447
You would know.

16:14.480 --> 16:17.917
Speaking of bad,
what's that smell?

16:17.951 --> 16:20.186
TORRES:
Huh, smells like... gasoline.

16:20.219 --> 16:21.320
Uh...

16:21.354 --> 16:23.957
we haven't opened yet.

16:23.990 --> 16:25.324
TORRES: Well, you might
want to put a few, uh,

16:25.358 --> 16:27.460
no-smoking signs up when you do.

16:27.493 --> 16:28.461
(panting)

16:31.164 --> 16:34.067
We don't have to
do this, you know.

16:36.102 --> 16:39.806
I really do
prefer to be nice

16:39.839 --> 16:44.510
at least until it's
time to not be nice.

16:44.543 --> 16:48.782
So let's start with
something easy.

16:48.815 --> 16:51.951
See what happens, hmm?

16:51.985 --> 16:54.754
When were you born?

16:54.788 --> 16:58.057
A simple question.

16:58.091 --> 17:00.326
When is your birthday?

17:00.359 --> 17:03.296
Huh?

17:03.329 --> 17:06.866
You look like a Leo.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.401
Am I right?

17:11.570 --> 17:13.940
Well, I guess it's time
to not be nice.

17:16.509 --> 17:18.277
(Gibbs choking)

17:21.247 --> 17:22.882
Gibbs, hang in there.

17:26.385 --> 17:27.821
Gibbs, hang in there.

17:30.223 --> 17:32.358
(gags)

17:32.391 --> 17:34.160
(coughs)

17:34.193 --> 17:36.462
There you go.

17:36.495 --> 17:38.231
Take a moment.

17:38.264 --> 17:41.835
Maybe, uh, reevaluate
your situation.

17:41.868 --> 17:43.502
Just stop, please stop.

17:43.536 --> 17:45.872
Okay.

17:45.905 --> 17:48.274
Let's try again.

17:48.307 --> 17:51.310
When is your birthday?

17:51.344 --> 17:54.013
(weakly):
* Birthday

17:54.047 --> 17:56.850
* Your first day on Earth day

17:56.883 --> 17:58.918
* Happy birthday

17:58.952 --> 18:02.021
* Happy birthday

18:02.055 --> 18:03.322
* To you.

18:03.356 --> 18:05.591
Look, you-you have
our passports. Okay?

18:05.624 --> 18:06.893
It's got his birthday in 'em.

18:06.926 --> 18:10.296
I want to hear it from him.

18:10.329 --> 18:12.565
After all, if he can't
even tell me that,

18:12.598 --> 18:15.234
how is he ever gonna
tell me the good stuff?

18:18.071 --> 18:19.405
(Gibbs choking)

18:23.509 --> 18:25.244
Stop it! You're killing him!
Stop!

18:26.345 --> 18:27.413
Stop!

18:27.446 --> 18:28.447
Stop!

18:28.481 --> 18:31.317
(Gibbs choking)

18:31.350 --> 18:33.586
(choking stops)

18:33.619 --> 18:34.587
Gibbs?

18:34.620 --> 18:35.621
Okay.

18:35.654 --> 18:37.623
Gibbs, can you hear me?

18:37.656 --> 18:40.026
Boss, can you hear me?

18:40.059 --> 18:41.194
Gibbs.

18:41.227 --> 18:42.896
He is alive.

18:42.929 --> 18:45.098
Our guests usually
survive this

18:45.131 --> 18:47.967
particular incentive.

18:48.001 --> 18:49.235
Usually.

18:50.970 --> 18:53.239
Untie him.

18:53.272 --> 18:54.473
I'm not telling you anything.

18:54.507 --> 18:56.342
I don't care.

18:56.375 --> 18:58.978
We have something special
planned for you.

19:00.914 --> 19:03.449
Suspect's name
is Jezebel Poppins.

19:03.482 --> 19:05.084
She's a bartender,
works at the club.

19:05.118 --> 19:06.352
Does she know our victim?

19:06.385 --> 19:09.022
Well, haven't
gotten that far yet.

19:09.055 --> 19:10.890
See what you can find out
and get back to me.

19:12.491 --> 19:14.260
Look, I don't know what to tell
you. I was cleaning the floor.

19:14.293 --> 19:15.361
With gasoline?

19:15.394 --> 19:17.163
It is a solvent.

19:17.196 --> 19:18.664
Look, I'm gonna pretend
I don't give a rat's ass

19:18.697 --> 19:20.099
what you were doing
with the gas can.

19:20.133 --> 19:21.667
Great. Then I'm
free to leave.

19:21.700 --> 19:25.204
Yeah, after you post bail
for attempted arson.

19:25.238 --> 19:26.672
(sighs)
Right now,

19:26.705 --> 19:28.274
I need you tell me

19:28.307 --> 19:30.409
if you've seen this guy
around the club.

19:32.946 --> 19:34.580
I take that as a yes.

19:34.613 --> 19:38.384
Yeah, I've seen him around.

19:38.417 --> 19:39.919
He was my boyfriend.

19:39.953 --> 19:43.122
Look...

19:45.158 --> 19:47.426
...we can help
each other here.

19:47.460 --> 19:50.964
Somebody killed your boyfriend
for a reason.

19:50.997 --> 19:53.366
We know he was
running drugs.

19:53.399 --> 19:54.667
That was a long time ago.

19:54.700 --> 19:56.502
Okay? He got clean.

19:56.535 --> 19:58.671
Didn't stay clean.

19:58.704 --> 20:00.974
No.

20:01.007 --> 20:06.079
Zach started running drugs
for my boss out of the club...

20:06.112 --> 20:08.147
or so he thought.

20:08.181 --> 20:12.118
Some things weren't
adding up and then he saw

20:12.151 --> 20:13.452
these hearings on the news

20:13.486 --> 20:14.988
and realized what he was
really bringing back

20:15.021 --> 20:16.555
from those trips to Paraguay.

20:16.589 --> 20:19.525
Black market uranium.

20:19.558 --> 20:21.194
When Zach realized
what he was a part of,

20:21.227 --> 20:23.329
he told me that he was
going to put an end to it.

20:23.362 --> 20:27.000
And that's why he called us.

20:27.033 --> 20:30.203
He called from a pay phone
so we couldn't trace his call.

20:30.236 --> 20:31.971
Your boss
must have suspected.

20:32.005 --> 20:33.372
Took Zach out.

20:33.406 --> 20:36.042
My boss runs everything
out of this place.

20:36.075 --> 20:40.246
I was gonna burn it to the
ground, put him out of business.

20:40.279 --> 20:43.182
You don't have to worry
about your boss.

20:43.216 --> 20:45.051
He's gonna pay.

20:45.084 --> 20:48.021
I just have to figure out
where he is first.

20:48.054 --> 20:50.456
But you already found him.

20:54.727 --> 20:58.464
That's him.
That's my boss.

21:05.438 --> 21:07.206
Psst.

21:09.108 --> 21:11.444
Hey, finally.
What took you so long?

21:13.112 --> 21:16.082
I hear you are the man
to help me with my new printer.

21:16.115 --> 21:19.218
That's not a new printer.

21:19.252 --> 21:21.354
Well, new to me, smart-ass.

21:21.387 --> 21:23.422
Your guard overheard
you in your cell

21:23.456 --> 21:26.225
talking clever
about computers the other day.

21:26.259 --> 21:29.028
I assume you can troubleshoot
a printer driver.

21:30.663 --> 21:32.365
So you're not gonna
torture me?

21:32.398 --> 21:34.567
No, I am not.

21:34.600 --> 21:36.602
But I can't speak
for everyone else.

21:36.635 --> 21:39.238
I'm still not gonna help you.

21:39.272 --> 21:41.374
You got something better to do?

21:41.407 --> 21:44.110
Yeah, I do.

21:44.143 --> 21:46.645
I have a life that I'd
like to get back to.

21:46.679 --> 21:48.514
Job, friends,

21:48.547 --> 21:51.117
a wife who's
four months' pregnant,

21:51.150 --> 21:52.718
maybe five, I'm not sure--
I don't know.

21:52.751 --> 21:55.388
I know that there's a baby
class, but I missed that.

21:55.421 --> 21:57.790
Do you know how to
change a diaper?

21:57.823 --> 21:59.325
'Cause I don't.

21:59.358 --> 22:00.793
I also don't know
how much longer

22:00.826 --> 22:04.430
I can go on eating
chicken scraps and beans.

22:04.463 --> 22:06.532
The one thing I do know is

22:06.565 --> 22:09.768
I sure as hell am not
helping you.

22:24.117 --> 22:25.718
Thanks.

22:28.454 --> 22:30.589
When is your birthday?

22:30.623 --> 22:32.425
Oh, please, just
let him eat, huh?

22:32.458 --> 22:34.427
You want to eat?

22:34.460 --> 22:36.729
Birthday.

22:36.762 --> 22:38.431
Go fish.

22:38.464 --> 22:40.733
Hey, just tell him
what he wants to hear.

22:42.635 --> 22:45.438
You have a family.

22:45.471 --> 22:47.473
You need to eat.

22:47.506 --> 22:48.774
Tell him.

22:52.811 --> 22:54.813
Your birthday.

22:59.918 --> 23:03.622
My birthday is
September 13, 1978.

23:10.396 --> 23:11.764
GUARD:
Muévete.

23:40.630 --> 23:42.365
Boss.

23:42.399 --> 23:44.167
What else did you
tell 'em, McGee?

23:44.201 --> 23:46.503
Nothing.

23:46.536 --> 23:48.171
Installed...

23:48.205 --> 23:51.608
I installed a printer driver
on their computer.

23:56.079 --> 23:58.381
Really want to do this?

24:00.383 --> 24:02.319
(grunts):
I don't know.

24:02.352 --> 24:03.686
You tell me.

24:04.787 --> 24:07.757
I didn't just do this
for me, you know.

24:07.790 --> 24:09.492
I got some food
for you, too.

24:09.526 --> 24:12.062
Here. Raisins.
Eat 'em.

24:12.095 --> 24:14.131
You're delirious, boss.

24:14.164 --> 24:17.100
I am, too.
We need to eat.

24:17.134 --> 24:19.502
It was a printer driver,
that's it-- it's meaningless.

24:19.536 --> 24:22.339
Really?

24:22.372 --> 24:24.107
That's it?
We need

24:24.141 --> 24:25.642
to start thinking
about staying alive, okay?

24:25.675 --> 24:27.110
We need to make compromises...

24:27.144 --> 24:28.345
There are no compromises, McGee.

24:28.378 --> 24:29.512
They're terrorists
and murderers.

24:29.546 --> 24:30.647
Yes, I know
who they are,

24:30.680 --> 24:32.149
but I'm about to be
a father, okay?

24:32.182 --> 24:34.051
I can't afford
the luxury of morality.

24:34.084 --> 24:36.419
Neither can you.
Eat the raisins.

24:47.530 --> 24:48.498
(grunts)

24:48.531 --> 24:51.034
(loud straining)

24:52.069 --> 24:54.304
Come on... come on!

24:56.473 --> 24:58.108
Come on...

24:58.141 --> 25:00.143
Thought you two were friends.

25:00.177 --> 25:01.744
Son of a bitch!
It was just a printer driver!

25:01.778 --> 25:02.812
Come on!

25:02.845 --> 25:04.247
Put him in his own cell.

25:04.281 --> 25:06.183
Give him a bed.
He's cooperating.

25:17.327 --> 25:19.196
Vamos.

25:24.301 --> 25:26.236
(breathing heavily)

25:29.739 --> 25:31.508
It's good work, Tim.

25:33.876 --> 25:36.313
Our nightclub owner's name
is Mickey Clark.

25:36.346 --> 25:38.515
Bought the club three
years ago, paid cash.

25:38.548 --> 25:39.849
Record?

25:39.882 --> 25:43.586
History of trafficking
weapons, people, drugs.

25:43.620 --> 25:45.255
And now uranium.

25:45.288 --> 25:47.424
We need to find out who
this guy is selling to.

25:47.457 --> 25:49.259
The last thing we need
is black market uranium

25:49.292 --> 25:50.460
getting into the U.S.

25:50.493 --> 25:52.529
Agreed, but first
we need to find him.

25:52.562 --> 25:54.331
We find him,
we find the R.A.C.

25:54.364 --> 25:56.133
God willing,
Gibbs and McGee.

25:56.166 --> 25:58.201
Hey, Abby,
you done running...

25:58.235 --> 26:00.137
Delilah, what are you
doing here?

26:00.170 --> 26:01.704
Oh, really? You got
a lead on my husband,

26:01.738 --> 26:03.140
and you expect me to stay away?

26:03.173 --> 26:05.275
Ah... was I
that obvious?

26:05.308 --> 26:07.144
And on an unsecured line.

26:07.177 --> 26:08.211
Do you have anything else
on this guy?

26:08.245 --> 26:09.746
'Cause right now
we got bugger all.

26:09.779 --> 26:12.215
Nothing on the BOLO,
no recent activity

26:12.249 --> 26:13.616
on his credit cards.

26:13.650 --> 26:15.685
Nothing recent, but I was
processing his computer,

26:15.718 --> 26:17.754
and our favorite
counterterrorism expert here

26:17.787 --> 26:19.589
showed up and noticed

26:19.622 --> 26:21.824
these older charges
on his statement.

26:24.327 --> 26:25.895
BISHOP:
Hmm.

26:25.928 --> 26:27.230
Hit That?

26:27.264 --> 26:28.365
It's a dating app.

26:28.398 --> 26:29.632
And your suspect was paying

26:29.666 --> 26:31.201
for premium services
on almost all of them.

26:31.234 --> 26:32.635
(Bishop stammers)

26:32.669 --> 26:35.305
Hold on, this is gonna
help us find our suspect how?

26:35.338 --> 26:38.141
Okay, so these are the people
that he was matched to.

26:38.175 --> 26:41.278
And, as with most of these apps,
they let you know

26:41.311 --> 26:43.646
how far away you are
from each of your matches.

26:43.680 --> 26:46.783
So you figure out how to use
that data to triangulate

26:46.816 --> 26:48.585
Clark's location.
ABBY: Bingo.

26:48.618 --> 26:52.422
So, we started by locating
the people he was matched with,

26:52.455 --> 26:55.658
and then it was just a matter
of working backwards from there.

26:55.692 --> 26:56.626
Take Shawna, for example.

26:56.659 --> 26:59.296
It says she's 52.9 miles away
from Clark.

26:59.329 --> 27:00.797
Now, we don't know
which direction he is,

27:00.830 --> 27:02.932
but we know he has to be
somewhere on that circle.

27:02.965 --> 27:07.170
ABBY: And then we repeated it
with a few more matches, and...

27:07.204 --> 27:10.273
Got a location.
Good job, guys.

27:10.307 --> 27:11.741
Reeves, take Torres.
Pick him up.

27:11.774 --> 27:13.810
Please hurry.

27:15.312 --> 27:17.247
(men speaking Spanish
in distance)

27:27.490 --> 27:30.493
So, what do you
want from me now?

27:30.527 --> 27:33.196
I...
(unzips bag)

27:33.230 --> 27:34.331
want you to eat.

27:36.333 --> 27:38.468
I thought about
what you said...

27:40.370 --> 27:42.705
...about your wife...

27:42.739 --> 27:44.674
and your baby.

27:46.008 --> 27:47.944
It's not right.

27:50.880 --> 27:53.616
And I thought perhaps...

27:53.650 --> 27:56.219
you could use this
as well.

28:01.524 --> 28:03.226
It's Nicholas.

28:03.260 --> 28:06.729
The patron saint
of children.

28:06.763 --> 28:09.532
It was my daughter's.

28:09.566 --> 28:11.568
It's a gift to yours.

28:11.601 --> 28:14.003
You had a family?

28:14.036 --> 28:18.641
They were killed
in an uprising years ago.

28:18.675 --> 28:21.378
That is how I fell
into el jefe.

28:21.411 --> 28:23.613
And became a terrorist?

28:23.646 --> 28:26.283
No, things were
different back then.

28:26.316 --> 28:29.886
The R.A.C. actually
stood for something.

28:29.919 --> 28:31.921
So, quit.

28:31.954 --> 28:34.391
Oh...

28:34.424 --> 28:36.659
The jefe's not someone
you quit.

28:36.693 --> 28:39.028
And believe me, I tried.

28:39.061 --> 28:41.331
Once.

28:41.364 --> 28:43.800
He killed two of my cousins.

28:46.035 --> 28:47.870
Yeah, that guy's
got issues.

28:47.904 --> 28:52.275
No, he's done far
crueler to others.

28:53.910 --> 28:56.913
But men need to work.

28:56.946 --> 28:59.816
There's not many opportunities
to drive an Uber down here.

28:59.849 --> 29:01.518
(McGee chuckles)

29:01.551 --> 29:03.886
So we all do
what we have to do.

29:05.555 --> 29:07.924
But I will say one thing.

29:07.957 --> 29:13.530
If I were to ever find
myself alone with him,

29:13.563 --> 29:15.932
it wouldn't be
a good day for him.

29:15.965 --> 29:17.567
(door opens)

29:29.111 --> 29:30.680
Like I said,

29:30.713 --> 29:32.982
we all do what we have to do.

29:33.015 --> 29:34.984
(shouting in Spanish
in distance)

29:38.455 --> 29:41.691
What took you so long?
You took forever.

29:41.724 --> 29:44.394
I didn't know
where you were.

29:44.427 --> 29:46.663
Did you get the blueprints
off the computer?

29:46.696 --> 29:47.997
No. Couldn't.

29:48.030 --> 29:49.399
They were watching
too closely.

29:51.568 --> 29:53.336
Did you get the alarm?
Yes, got the alarm.

29:53.370 --> 29:55.104
It's all set.
2100 hours.

29:55.137 --> 29:56.573
We move to the exit,

29:56.606 --> 29:58.475
wait to make our escape.

30:01.143 --> 30:03.546
How's your nose?
It hurts.

30:03.580 --> 30:04.847
Why'd you have
to swing so hard?

30:04.881 --> 30:07.049
Why'd you have to break
my wood carving?

30:08.785 --> 30:12.321
(actors on TV speaking Spanish)
(Jefe laughing)

30:17.760 --> 30:19.496
(mutters)

30:19.529 --> 30:20.497
¿Qué?

30:25.167 --> 30:28.037
Let's start with
something easy.

30:28.070 --> 30:31.140
When's your birthday?

30:31.173 --> 30:33.376
BISHOP: Hmm, it's almost
more interesting

30:33.410 --> 30:34.577
without the volume.

30:34.611 --> 30:36.145
That's why people
hate politics.

30:36.178 --> 30:39.716
Ah, but that is
why people love you.

30:39.749 --> 30:41.050
You found our club owner.

30:41.083 --> 30:42.785
TORRES: Yeah, he was
in the middle of a date.

30:42.819 --> 30:44.120
Interrogation.

30:44.153 --> 30:45.888
I spent three nights
texting that chick.

30:45.922 --> 30:48.124
You couldn't have arrested me
before I got carpal tunnel?

30:48.157 --> 30:50.092
He had a burner phone on him.
Hmm.

30:50.126 --> 30:51.794
Only one overseas number in it.

30:51.828 --> 30:53.730
Well, shouldn't take long
to trace it.

30:53.763 --> 30:54.997
Abby, since you're here.

30:55.031 --> 30:56.933
On it, boss.

30:56.966 --> 30:58.401
Bossette.

30:58.435 --> 31:00.136
He say anything
in the car?
No.

31:00.169 --> 31:02.439
He knew
his victim told us nothing.

31:02.472 --> 31:05.141
Thanks to Reeves blabbering
in the crime scene.

31:05.174 --> 31:06.976
Cool accent.
Not too smart.

31:07.009 --> 31:09.479
Houston, we have a problem.

31:09.512 --> 31:11.013
What's wrong?

31:11.047 --> 31:12.982
The international number
that our guy's been calling

31:13.015 --> 31:14.784
has a blacklisted IMEI.

31:14.817 --> 31:16.586
I can't trace it.

31:16.619 --> 31:18.588
There's got to be a way to
find out whose number that is.

31:19.822 --> 31:20.957
There is.

31:25.628 --> 31:28.431
(phone ringing)

31:28.465 --> 31:29.432
(click)

31:29.466 --> 31:31.634
Uh, hello?

31:31.668 --> 31:32.902
Is anyone there?

31:32.935 --> 31:33.936
McGEE:
Bishop?

31:35.204 --> 31:36.205
McGee?

31:36.238 --> 31:38.074
Uh, are you okay?

31:38.107 --> 31:40.042
Please tell me I'm not
hallucinating right now.

31:40.076 --> 31:41.611
You're not, just tell us

31:41.644 --> 31:42.912
where you are,
we're coming to get you.

31:48.655 --> 31:50.156
BISHOP:
Okay, what's your status?

31:50.190 --> 31:51.558
Is your position stable?

31:51.592 --> 31:52.826
No. Negative.

31:52.859 --> 31:54.695
We need an exfil ASAP.

31:54.728 --> 31:56.296
Paraguay military
can have a chopper

31:56.329 --> 31:57.864
airborne in an hour, but...

31:57.898 --> 31:59.165
McGEE:
No, we need it by 2100.

31:59.199 --> 32:00.601
What happens then?

32:00.634 --> 32:02.035
Get the chopper.

32:02.068 --> 32:03.236
BISHOP:
Do you have an evac site?

32:03.269 --> 32:04.738
It's got to be the top deck.

32:04.771 --> 32:06.239
How are you gonna make it
to the top of the ship

32:06.272 --> 32:08.709
without being seen?
And exfil
without getting shot at?

32:08.742 --> 32:09.776
That is our problem.

32:09.810 --> 32:11.044
Get the chopper.

32:11.077 --> 32:12.746
We'll pull the coordinates
from this sat phone.

32:14.347 --> 32:16.016
Well, looks like we just went
from a snowball's chance

32:16.049 --> 32:17.317
in hell of getting out of here

32:17.350 --> 32:19.152
to a snowball's chance in...
Arizona.

32:19.185 --> 32:20.721
I'll take it.

32:20.754 --> 32:22.689
McGee, get the GPS.

32:22.723 --> 32:23.924
Yeah.

32:23.957 --> 32:25.992
All right, what's the play?

32:26.026 --> 32:27.794
I got to think.
About what?

32:27.828 --> 32:29.796
Just send the helicopter.
No, we can't.

32:29.830 --> 32:30.964
We're out of the loop.

32:30.997 --> 32:33.667
The request has
to come from DoD.

32:33.700 --> 32:35.969
CONGRESSMAN:
Director Vance,

32:36.002 --> 32:38.338
my main concern here

32:38.371 --> 32:40.140
is the damage done
to our nuclear

32:40.173 --> 32:41.708
nonproliferation efforts.

32:43.744 --> 32:46.212
(phone buzzing)

32:46.246 --> 32:48.114
All right.

32:48.148 --> 32:49.816
(Bishop speaking indistinctly
over phone)

32:49.850 --> 32:52.218
When?

32:52.252 --> 32:53.954
Both of them?

32:53.987 --> 32:55.989
Copy that, I'll take care of it.

32:56.022 --> 32:58.224
Another personal note?

32:58.258 --> 33:00.226
Ladies and gentlemen, I just
received word that our team

33:00.260 --> 33:02.362
has located
Agents Gibbs and McGee.

33:02.395 --> 33:04.297
CONGRESSMAN:
And, apparently,

33:04.330 --> 33:06.833
violated a direct order
from the Pentagon.

33:06.867 --> 33:08.702
All due respect, sir,
we don't have time.

33:08.735 --> 33:09.770
To be a nation of laws?

33:09.803 --> 33:10.637
Sir, I don't know if you heard.
Director Vance...

33:10.671 --> 33:12.706
I have two men
who are in jeopardy...

33:12.739 --> 33:14.107
(gavel banging)
NCIS is ordered to stand down.

33:14.140 --> 33:16.710
Order! Order!

33:16.743 --> 33:17.878
Director Vance,

33:17.911 --> 33:19.379
in deference to your men,

33:19.412 --> 33:22.182
I move that we switch
to an off-the-record

33:22.215 --> 33:24.885
briefing where you turn all

33:24.918 --> 33:27.220
information about
their whereabouts

33:27.253 --> 33:29.956
over to your colleagues here
at the DoD.

33:29.990 --> 33:33.026
And then they will
take it from there.

33:33.059 --> 33:35.095
This meeting is adjourned.

33:35.128 --> 33:36.362
Audio off, please.

33:39.332 --> 33:41.434
Admiral, I need
helicopter assistance

33:41.467 --> 33:43.103
from the Paraguayan
military immediately.

33:43.136 --> 33:44.905
I suggest you
stop wasting time

33:44.938 --> 33:46.072
and call it in yourself.

33:47.173 --> 33:48.374
But you just said...

33:48.408 --> 33:50.711
A lot of things.

33:50.744 --> 33:53.313
Ah, but the cameras
are off now.

33:54.881 --> 33:56.049
I know time is of the essence,

33:56.082 --> 33:57.417
but I just want to say,

33:57.450 --> 33:58.919
on behalf of myself

33:58.952 --> 34:00.253
and my committee...

34:00.286 --> 34:01.822
We're proud as hell
of the work

34:01.855 --> 34:03.089
that you and
your team have done.

34:03.123 --> 34:04.691
Just please try

34:04.725 --> 34:08.194
and color inside
the line next time.

34:08.228 --> 34:10.697
You know, this is why
people don't like politics.

34:10.731 --> 34:12.232
And I don't blame 'em.

34:12.265 --> 34:14.400
Now go get your men.

34:14.434 --> 34:17.270
I need that location,
Agent Bishop.

34:17.303 --> 34:18.805
We are working on it.

34:18.839 --> 34:20.707
(door opens)
Is the bird in the air yet?

34:20.741 --> 34:24.444
Paraguayan military's standing
by, awaiting coordinates.

34:24.477 --> 34:25.779
All right, so what's
the holdup, Gibbs?

34:25.812 --> 34:27.914
We don't know where we are.

34:27.948 --> 34:30.917
The GPS on Jefe's
sat phone's disabled.

34:30.951 --> 34:32.919
Is there any way
we can re-enable it?

34:32.953 --> 34:34.087
McGEE:
Bishop, can you force

34:34.120 --> 34:36.089
a firmware flash?
BISHOP: Uh, yes,

34:36.122 --> 34:38.424
but it'll take at least an hour
to upload over satellite.

34:38.458 --> 34:40.160
GIBBS:
We don't have it, Bishop.

34:40.193 --> 34:42.062
If only that guy
had Tinder.

34:42.095 --> 34:43.764
Really?

34:43.797 --> 34:46.066
Because he clearly needs
to meet someone special?

34:46.099 --> 34:48.501
N-No, so we can get
your distance.

34:48.534 --> 34:50.436
Torres, that's it.

34:50.470 --> 34:52.338
Uh, the firmware

34:52.372 --> 34:54.074
will take too long,
but we can easily push

34:54.107 --> 34:55.842
a small dating app

34:55.876 --> 34:58.879
onto the sat phone, which
will then force a GPS update.

35:02.115 --> 35:03.483
All right, uh,

35:03.516 --> 35:05.251
hobbies?
Not dying.

35:05.285 --> 35:06.419
(sighs)
Sorry. Right.

35:09.522 --> 35:10.356
Bishop.

35:10.390 --> 35:12.458
Um, almost there.

35:12.492 --> 35:14.327
Need to narrow
the search parameters down

35:14.360 --> 35:16.930
to McGee's specific profile.

35:16.963 --> 35:18.131
Okay.

35:18.164 --> 35:19.532
And then we auto-swipe

35:19.565 --> 35:21.768
until...

35:27.974 --> 35:29.542
...we get a match.

35:29.575 --> 35:32.178
"4,451 miles away."

35:32.212 --> 35:34.014
They're 4,451 miles away

35:34.047 --> 35:35.215
from the Navy yard.

35:35.248 --> 35:36.983
Look for a deepwater river.

35:41.421 --> 35:43.156
I got 'em.
They're in a side channel

35:43.189 --> 35:44.390
of the Paraná River.

35:44.424 --> 35:46.059
We can have a chopper there
in 20 minutes.

35:46.092 --> 35:47.994
Do it. Gibbs, you think
you can make it topside

35:48.028 --> 35:49.195
in that time?

35:50.263 --> 35:51.998
We're really cutting it close,
boss

35:52.032 --> 35:53.934
Cutting what close?

35:53.967 --> 35:56.036
Let you know
when we see you, Leon.

35:56.069 --> 35:58.905
You have just committed suicide.

35:58.939 --> 36:02.108
Do you really think you're gonna
simply waltz past my men?

36:02.142 --> 36:04.777
Actually...

36:06.847 --> 36:07.480
...yeah.

36:11.151 --> 36:12.352
Incoming.

36:12.385 --> 36:13.353
(muffled groaning)

36:16.022 --> 36:17.390
Boss, I've been thinking.

36:17.423 --> 36:18.892
GIBBS:
Bad idea.
But...

36:18.925 --> 36:20.160
We're gonna make it, McGee.

36:23.029 --> 36:24.164
(Jefe groans)

36:28.268 --> 36:29.903
Paraguayan military
now en route.

36:29.936 --> 36:32.338
ETA: six minutes.

36:34.474 --> 36:35.575
MAN:
Jefe?

36:36.943 --> 36:38.578
(shouting in Spanish)

36:44.350 --> 36:46.887
TAGGART: Chopper's
three minutes from exfil.

36:46.920 --> 36:48.454
No eyes on the target yet.

36:48.488 --> 36:50.090
That location better be right.

36:52.025 --> 36:53.826
(man shouting in Spanish
in distance)

36:55.461 --> 36:57.330
MAN:
Drop the gun right now!

36:57.363 --> 36:58.231
McGEE:
You first.

37:01.968 --> 37:03.203
Shoot them.
Shoot them both!

37:03.236 --> 37:05.605
(alarm sounding)

37:09.309 --> 37:10.376
(indistinct shouting)

37:16.116 --> 37:17.283
(screams)

37:19.119 --> 37:20.486
Who set off the alarm?

37:20.520 --> 37:22.088
You should've never let
me near your computer.

37:22.122 --> 37:24.357
We got to move.
Oh, you're gonna pay for this.

37:24.390 --> 37:26.993
I own half the government
officials around here.

37:27.027 --> 37:28.361
I'll be a free man
by the end of the day

37:28.394 --> 37:30.163
and I will not forget you.

37:30.196 --> 37:31.898
Oh, you think you're
gonna come with us?

37:31.932 --> 37:34.000
That would be nice,

37:34.034 --> 37:35.368
but, you know,

37:35.401 --> 37:37.137
I think it's time
to not be nice.

37:42.708 --> 37:44.077
I'll take it from here.

38:04.464 --> 38:07.400
(helicopter blades whirring)

38:24.017 --> 38:26.953
("Broken Things" by Ryan Adams
playing)

38:31.024 --> 38:36.429
* I've come to you
from broken things *

38:36.462 --> 38:41.701
* I've crawled to you
on my hands and knees... *

38:41.734 --> 38:44.570
(gasps)
McGee!

38:44.604 --> 38:46.372
(shushing)

38:46.406 --> 38:48.041
(whispers):
Um, where is she?

38:48.074 --> 38:49.575
(whispers):
Yeah.

38:49.609 --> 38:53.079
* If only to hear you
say my name... *

38:53.113 --> 38:54.614
We weren't expecting
you till tomorrow.

38:56.416 --> 39:01.354
* I've come to you
from broken times... *

39:01.387 --> 39:03.056
DELILAH:
Who's at the door, Abbs?

39:03.089 --> 39:08.194
* I've shown you my face
with no disguise *

39:08.228 --> 39:11.998
* My memory's a mirror
without eyes *

39:12.032 --> 39:15.135
I said, who is at the...?

39:15.168 --> 39:20.240
* If only to take away
your pain *

39:21.641 --> 39:27.680
* If only to hear you
say my name *

39:27.713 --> 39:32.052
* You're the whisper
in the rising wind *

39:32.085 --> 39:34.187
* Empty and so cold

39:34.220 --> 39:37.123
* Too dark
for the birds to fly in... *

39:37.157 --> 39:38.624
Aw, that's great, Abbs.

39:38.658 --> 39:40.493
Yeah, is everyone else there?

39:40.526 --> 39:42.628
All right.
Well, I'm just finishing up

39:42.662 --> 39:45.565
some loose ends here
and I will be right over.

39:45.598 --> 39:48.368
Okay.

39:48.401 --> 39:51.604
* I watch them
as they rise into the sun... *

39:51.637 --> 39:53.373
Gibbs, I...

39:53.406 --> 39:55.075
I thought you were with McGee.

39:55.108 --> 39:57.810
I was.

39:57.843 --> 39:59.179
(soft chuckle)

40:02.248 --> 40:03.749
Welcome home.

40:03.783 --> 40:05.751
* When the day is new,
the light is warm... *

40:05.785 --> 40:08.020
I'm proud of you, Bishop.

40:10.323 --> 40:12.258
Kept the team together.

40:12.292 --> 40:14.026
I'm proud of you.

40:15.295 --> 40:17.430
Well,

40:17.463 --> 40:20.700
I just...
did what I thought you would do.

40:22.435 --> 40:26.772
* If only you believed
all of my lies... *

40:26.806 --> 40:28.408
Um...

40:28.441 --> 40:31.411
everyone's meeting
at McGee's house.

40:31.444 --> 40:33.113
You want to come?

40:34.847 --> 40:37.283
Nope.

40:37.317 --> 40:40.286
* When I'm lazy in the wind,
the colors sag... *

40:40.320 --> 40:44.424
Well, call me
if you need anything.

40:44.457 --> 40:46.792
* As the clouds go rolling
off the hill *

40:49.862 --> 40:54.167
* Can't tell where the roofs
begin and end *

40:56.469 --> 41:01.574
* No more will I know
my home again *

41:01.607 --> 41:06.679
* Hear the whisper
of the rising wind *

41:06.712 --> 41:08.681
* Empty and so cold

41:08.714 --> 41:13.286
* Too dark for the birds
to fly in *

41:13.319 --> 41:16.689
* They're lined up on the wall

41:16.722 --> 41:19.492
* As I'm walking by

41:19.525 --> 41:23.563
* They scatter and take off

41:23.596 --> 41:26.299
* Watch them as they rise

41:26.332 --> 41:28.268
* Into the sun

41:30.270 --> 41:33.773
* If only you believed
you were the one *

41:36.776 --> 41:40.646
* If only you believed
you were the one *

41:43.649 --> 41:47.620
* If only you believed
you were the one. *
