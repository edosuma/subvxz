[Charmaine] Are you gonna
say anything or just…

00:20.812 --> 00:22.230
How could you be so selfish?

00:22.313 --> 00:25.525
All I can do, Jack,
is apologize over and over.

00:25.608 --> 00:27.694
-Well, that's not good enough.
-I know.

00:27.777 --> 00:29.446
So, go ahead. Yell at me.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.656
Tell me what a terrible person I am.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.783
[pensive music playing]

00:33.867 --> 00:35.243
That's not why I'm here.

00:35.744 --> 00:39.372
I'm just trying to understand,
after everything I did for you…

00:41.374 --> 00:42.250
And Mel too.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.211
I mean, you drag her into this.

00:45.295 --> 00:48.339
I don't get you, Jack.
I thought you'd be relieved

00:48.423 --> 00:50.884
that you and Mel
didn't have to deal with me anymore.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.135
I'm not relieved.

00:52.218 --> 00:56.014
I thought I was gonna be
a father to twin boys,

00:56.097 --> 00:57.599
and you made me believe that.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.559
You made everybody believe that.

01:00.435 --> 01:02.896
For months, I break my back for you,

01:02.979 --> 01:07.275
making sure that you had everything
that you could possibly need.

01:09.694 --> 01:12.197
I would have done anything for those boys.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.035
And you just took it away.

01:19.579 --> 01:20.789
You humiliated me.

01:23.708 --> 01:24.876
And you broke my heart.

01:24.959 --> 01:26.961
Well, now you know how it feels.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.838
Don't you dare put this on me. No.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.925
[desperately] Jack, you don't understand.
The way things ended between us?

01:32.509 --> 01:37.055
Watching you pull away and fall in love
with Mel right under my nose?

01:38.098 --> 01:39.390
That was torture.

01:40.767 --> 01:44.395
And then I found out I was pregnant,
and I was afraid.

01:45.188 --> 01:46.314
And I was alone.

01:48.691 --> 01:50.568
And the worst part about it…

01:51.528 --> 01:54.114
was the thought
that I was gonna lose you forever.

01:56.908 --> 01:57.867
So I lied.

01:59.077 --> 02:00.745
What do you expect me to say?

02:00.829 --> 02:02.330
I don't know, Jack.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.168
I just hope you can forgive me.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.379
Have you even told the real father?

02:09.462 --> 02:12.465
Oh, no. [scoffs]
No, that was just a one-time thing.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.634
He's not cut out to be a father.

02:14.717 --> 02:16.010
And how do you know that?

02:16.094 --> 02:17.554
Because he's not like you.

02:19.931 --> 02:22.851
I lied to give the twins a future.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.397
Someone to provide for us.

02:30.233 --> 02:33.653
Isn't there a small part of you
that can sympathize with that?

02:33.736 --> 02:35.488
[pensive music continues]

02:35.572 --> 02:37.198
You have my sympathy, yeah.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.077

So that coward couldn't try
to intimidate me out of testifying.

02:56.759 --> 03:00.221
Yeah, well, I don't think
we should just assume it was Don.

03:00.305 --> 03:01.139
Really?

03:02.265 --> 03:05.518
Maybe some drunk teenagers
screwing around or something.

Do you know how many violent criminals
I have prosecuted in my career?

03:09.439 --> 03:11.065
I know a threat when I see one.

03:11.149 --> 03:12.734
Well, how can you be so sure?

03:13.234 --> 03:16.029
Because it felt like one, Brady.

03:17.238 --> 03:18.990
Yeah. Okay.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.117
I hear you.

03:21.868 --> 03:22.994
Come here.

03:23.828 --> 03:24.704
Hey.

03:25.788 --> 03:29.375
I won't let anything happen to you.

03:29.918 --> 03:30.752
Okay?

and you are gonna help write it.

for my follow-up with Dr. Hayek.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.012
Yes, it's right this way, Muriel.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.155
[Brady] Hey! We had a deal.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.448
You could have hurt her!

12:20.531 --> 12:23.117
-[man] Hey. Quiet, pal.
-And who the hell are you?

12:23.701 --> 12:26.245
The guy standing between you
and something you'll regret.

12:27.538 --> 12:31.041
This is Gene Sackheim. A friend of mine.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.210
Gene, Daniel Brady.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.837
The one I was telling you about.

12:34.920 --> 12:38.048
You went back on your word.
You said you'd leave her alone.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.426
[Melissa] Let me remind you
of our agreement.

12:40.509 --> 12:43.429
Yeah, I play company man.
You stay the hell away from Brie.

12:43.512 --> 12:44.638
That was the deal!

12:44.722 --> 12:46.640
And I intend to honor it.

12:46.724 --> 12:49.894
By throwing a goddamn rock through
her window and scaring her half to death?

12:49.977 --> 12:52.521
This is becoming
a pattern with you, Brady.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.565
-What is?
-Disrespect.

12:55.357 --> 12:57.485
Is the chain of command unclear?

13:00.279 --> 13:01.113
No.

13:02.198 --> 13:06.327
Good, because I need you to stay late
and supervise another shipment.

13:06.410 --> 13:09.079
Make sure Jeb is up to speed
when it comes in.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.457
[in background] I expect more from you…

13:14.835 --> 13:15.795
Yo, Brady.

13:17.671 --> 13:19.215
If we wanted to hurt her, we would've.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.347
[Brie] You know what
I just can't wrap my head around?

13:26.430 --> 13:31.143
That Charmaine went to such lengths
to trap you in her web of lies.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.395
-[Jack laughs]
-I mean, you're not that good a catch.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.105
[Jack chortles] Come on!

13:35.189 --> 13:38.609
I think there's a few women in town
that would disagree with you.

13:38.692 --> 13:41.737
[Brie] Your stinky feet alone
would drive most of them away.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.697
Honesty, I don't know
how Mel puts up with it.

13:43.781 --> 13:46.534
-[Jack] Sure you do. Runs in the family.
-[laughs] Oh, as if!

13:46.617 --> 13:48.661
Oh, hey, don't dish it out
if you can't take it.

13:48.744 --> 13:51.247
Well, at least
you're not passing it down to twins.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.373
[Jack] Ooh…

13:53.749 --> 13:55.709
[Brie] Sorry, too soon.

13:59.505 --> 14:00.339
Look.

14:01.048 --> 14:04.343
You and Mel,
you'll have, like, a million babies.

14:04.426 --> 14:05.302
[Jack chuckles]

14:05.386 --> 14:07.972
Yeah, how about we start with one
and go from there?

14:10.599 --> 14:12.309
You know, I just gotta say--

14:12.393 --> 14:15.479
-Okay, here we go. Mmm-hmm.
-[laughs] No, I'm serious.

14:16.063 --> 14:18.899
You're someone who goes the extra mile
for the people that you care about,

14:18.983 --> 14:20.109
even when it's hard.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.194
That's how I know
things are gonna work out for you.

14:22.278 --> 14:24.113
Are you getting sentimental on me?

14:24.196 --> 14:25.406
[Brie breathes deeply]

14:26.156 --> 14:28.409
The thing that
I want to talk to you about…

14:29.743 --> 14:32.413
I told Mel. I asked her
not to say anything to you.

14:32.496 --> 14:33.747
What's going on?

14:34.498 --> 14:38.377
You remember that guy
that I was seeing before I came here?

14:38.460 --> 14:39.378
Don?

14:41.463 --> 14:43.465
[gentle music playing]

14:44.592 --> 14:46.427
This place has been around forever.

14:47.011 --> 14:51.557
We used to come here for
special occasions, birthdays, graduations.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.142
Oh, that's so sweet.

14:53.225 --> 14:56.520
I actually came out to my mom here.
She was super supportive.

14:56.604 --> 14:57.605
Dad too.

14:59.064 --> 15:01.066
-Honestly, the whole town was.
-Yeah.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.444
Well,
Virgin River definitely has its quirks,

15:03.527 --> 15:05.279
but the people couldn't be kinder.

15:05.362 --> 15:06.989
-Here's to that.
-[chuckles]

15:11.785 --> 15:14.872
Listen, I know we're just
kinda getting to know each other,

15:14.955 --> 15:17.374
but when you came out of
Dr. Kane's office today,

15:17.458 --> 15:18.751
-you seemed a little--
-Off?

15:18.834 --> 15:22.171
Just like you had a lot on your mind.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.298
Thought I covered pretty well.

15:24.381 --> 15:25.382
How could you tell?

15:26.717 --> 15:27.968
Nurse's intuition.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.767
A few years ago, I had
laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis.

15:36.143 --> 15:38.771
I always knew
there was a chance it could recur, but…

15:39.647 --> 15:40.564
it's back.

15:41.231 --> 15:43.150
-That's it.
-[sighs] I'm so sorry.

15:44.151 --> 15:46.820
So the pain you had last night,
that was an endometrioma?

15:46.904 --> 15:48.822
Yeah, luckily it didn't rupture.

15:50.115 --> 15:53.077
But the tissue's
definitely spreading again.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.663
Yay for me.

15:56.664 --> 15:59.041
So, what's your plan, treatment-wise?

15:59.124 --> 16:01.126
I mean, I could always get
another procedure,

16:01.210 --> 16:04.838
try to remove the tissue, but I've lived
with the pain for so long that…

16:06.548 --> 16:09.134
Dr. Kane thinks that I should
consider a hysterectomy.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.135
Oh.

16:10.678 --> 16:11.887
How do you feel about that?

16:13.013 --> 16:13.889
I don't know.

16:16.809 --> 16:17.851
Maybe I'll just do it.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.896
I think, you know, that's a--
It's a really big decision.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.650
You should think about it. I mean,
were you planning to have kids someday?

16:24.733 --> 16:27.695
You know what? Why don't
we just talk about something else?

16:28.445 --> 16:30.406
Or, uh,
maybe we should just get the check.

16:30.990 --> 16:31.824
Yeah.

16:34.076 --> 16:37.538
"Which is why if you don't reconsider
this ludicrous power grab,

16:37.621 --> 16:41.333
the legitimacy of the office
will forever be tainted. Thank you."

16:41.417 --> 16:42.376
What do you think?

16:42.459 --> 16:44.336
It's really more of a rant than a speech.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.131
Well, I think it's perfect.
Wouldn't change a word.

16:47.214 --> 16:49.633
The ending could use some work
at the very least.

16:49.717 --> 16:53.178
I don't recall asking
the peanut gallery, but go on.

16:53.262 --> 16:54.096
[Denny] Okay.

16:54.179 --> 16:57.016
A great speech lays out
a detailed, action-oriented plan,

16:57.099 --> 16:59.601
and the conclusion
reminds everyone what you plan to do.

16:59.685 --> 17:02.771
I disagree. Think about
the best movie speeches of all time.

17:02.855 --> 17:07.401
Notting Hill, Bridget Jones, The Notebook.
They're all, like, super emotional.

17:07.484 --> 17:10.487
-Are those your favorite movies?
-Don't pretend you don't love them.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.823
Okay, you two, back to business.

17:12.906 --> 17:15.743
I don't mean to brag, but I know
a thing or two about speechwriting.

17:15.826 --> 17:17.536
-Oh, do you?
-Yeah. That's right.

17:17.619 --> 17:19.705
I ran for class president
senior year of high school.

17:19.788 --> 17:20.831
You were class president?

17:20.914 --> 17:23.542
Well, no, I didn't win,
but it had nothing to do with the speech.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.586
The other guy gave out Blow Pops.

17:25.669 --> 17:26.754
What's a Blow Pop?

17:27.546 --> 17:30.215
-Do we need Blow Pops?
-It's not the worst idea.

17:30.299 --> 17:33.969
Don't listen to Denny.
He lost an election to the Lollipop Guild.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.388
[Denny] Oh, and remind me,
did you run for class president?

17:36.472 --> 17:38.432
-[Lizzie] Irrelevant.
-Seems pretty relevant to me.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.101
-Where are you going?
-Headache.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.770
Wait, I'll get your medicine.

17:47.858 --> 17:49.401
Did you see who walked in?

17:49.485 --> 17:50.319
Who?

17:53.280 --> 17:54.698
[woman] Double trouble.

18:01.622 --> 18:05.334
Charmaine, why don't you wait in my office
till the exam room's open.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.754
-Dr. Mullins.
-Cameron.

18:15.052 --> 18:17.387
Oh! Yeah, I meant to ask.

18:17.471 --> 18:19.598
How are you and Doc doing without Mel?

18:20.808 --> 18:21.642
Fine.

18:22.142 --> 18:22.976
[laughs]

18:23.060 --> 18:24.520
That bad, huh?

18:24.603 --> 18:26.688
-We're working out the kinks.
-Well, Doc can be, um--

18:26.772 --> 18:28.232
A pain in the neck.

18:28.315 --> 18:30.818
Mercurial, but, yeah, he can be that.

18:33.153 --> 18:36.073
[clears throat]
I know you're not asking for my advice.

18:36.156 --> 18:37.491
No, I'm begging.

18:38.992 --> 18:42.121
Doc… can handle a little backbone.

18:42.621 --> 18:44.581
He's married to Hope, for crying out loud.

18:44.665 --> 18:48.961
So if you do have a problem with him,
stand your ground, and he'll respect that.

18:49.545 --> 18:50.838
Thank you for the tip.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.422
I'll give it a shot.

18:53.006 --> 18:56.009
But, first, I need to figure out
how to file these insurance papers.

18:56.593 --> 18:59.346
Oh yeah, he said,
"Figure it out or get out of the way."

19:01.515 --> 19:03.725
Why don't I file those claims for you?

19:04.351 --> 19:08.105
I used to be a dental biller in between
acting gigs when I was living in New York.

19:08.188 --> 19:10.399
-You were an actress?
-[both chuckle]

19:10.482 --> 19:15.195
Well, as Angela Lansbury said,
"Once an actress, always an actress."

19:16.780 --> 19:18.657
Oh my gosh.

19:18.740 --> 19:21.869
-[Doc laughing]
-They're so fast!

19:21.952 --> 19:24.121
-[Doc] Yeah. There you go.
-Oh, thank you.

19:24.204 --> 19:25.247
They're doing great.

19:25.873 --> 19:29.376
And you can talk to Dr. Singer about,
uh, pregnancy-safe SSRIs.

19:29.459 --> 19:31.670
And if you need anything else,
you know where to find me.

19:31.753 --> 19:32.838
Thanks, Doc.

19:32.921 --> 19:38.635
Yeah, and if you can help it,
don't worry about the gossip mill, okay?

19:38.719 --> 19:41.305
I mean, they're gonna
move on to the next story soon enough.

19:41.388 --> 19:43.974
You are a resilient woman, Charmaine.

19:45.809 --> 19:47.352
You get that from your mother.

19:47.436 --> 19:50.439
[scoffs] Yeah, that's not
the only thing I got from her.

19:50.522 --> 19:51.607
Oh? What do you mean?

19:51.690 --> 19:57.654
[sighs] Well, I feel like
my life is just a series of bad choices,

19:58.197 --> 19:59.323
just like Mom.

20:01.074 --> 20:04.369
People gossiped about her, too,
in bars and restaurants.

20:04.995 --> 20:08.081
Though, I think a doctor's office
is probably a first.

20:08.749 --> 20:09.958
And here I am.

20:10.042 --> 20:13.378
All alone and mad at the world,
just like her.

20:14.004 --> 20:15.672
Is that how you remember her?

20:16.882 --> 20:21.345
Because I remember a lovely, brave,

20:21.428 --> 20:24.473
whip-smart young woman, just like you.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.727
Rachel was fiercely independent.

20:28.810 --> 20:30.145
All I'm saying is…

20:30.229 --> 20:34.316
is once you let yourself
see how wonderful you are,

20:35.442 --> 20:37.778
the right person will see it too.

20:37.861 --> 20:38.987
Thanks, Doc.

20:40.739 --> 20:43.909
Yeah. Never too late
to start believing in yourself.

20:44.451 --> 20:45.869
-I'll try.
-[laughs] Yeah.

20:55.837 --> 20:56.922
[Jack] Brie, I'm, um…

21:00.509 --> 21:02.135
I'm so sorry that happened.

21:04.846 --> 21:07.099
I want you to know
I think you're a superhero.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.893
You're just realizing that now?

21:10.477 --> 21:11.561
[hoarsely] I mean it.

21:12.896 --> 21:16.233
And you better believe that I'm gonna be
right by your side the day of the trial.

21:17.943 --> 21:21.238
Actually, that's part of what
I wanted to talk to you about.

21:22.906 --> 21:26.076
-I don't think that's a good idea.
-Of course I'm gonna be there.

21:26.159 --> 21:28.370
I want to see
the look in that son of a bitch's eyes

21:28.453 --> 21:30.414
-when you put him behind bars.
-And if I don't win?

21:30.497 --> 21:32.457
What, you're gonna
kick Don's ass in the courtroom?

21:32.541 --> 21:35.252
-Yeah, and I'll take that rock--
-This is what I was worried about.

21:36.336 --> 21:37.671
This isn't your fight.

21:40.215 --> 21:43.844
It's gonna be hard enough to tell
a room full of strangers what happened.

21:44.344 --> 21:47.347
And the last thing I need
is to worry about your reaction.

21:48.098 --> 21:49.891
You really don't want me there?

21:49.975 --> 21:54.062
What I need right now… is your support.

21:54.688 --> 21:55.897
Not your protection.

22:00.235 --> 22:01.111
Okay.

22:03.196 --> 22:04.614
You're right. I'm sorry.

22:05.824 --> 22:08.994
I just can't stomach
the idea of you being there alone.

22:09.077 --> 22:10.370
Well, I'm not.

22:11.455 --> 22:12.372
Brady's coming.

22:12.956 --> 22:15.334
He has been there every step of the way.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.170
If you really want to support me…

22:19.671 --> 22:21.256
you'll give him another chance.

22:22.466 --> 22:23.717
What do you have in mind?

22:25.344 --> 22:27.763
Dinner, my new place, tonight.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.599
-You, me, Mel, and Brady.
-Oh, cute.

22:30.682 --> 22:34.186
[chuckling] I don't have silverware yet,
but I do feel like hosting.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.356
And you have a restaurant,
so I think we'll make do.

22:39.274 --> 22:40.525
[Jack] Uh…

22:41.193 --> 22:42.944
It's really important to me.

22:45.822 --> 22:47.824
Yeah, I'll text Mel
as soon as we get reception.

22:51.286 --> 22:52.412
[exhales]

22:54.331 --> 22:56.083
Are you sure
there's nothing else I can do?

22:56.666 --> 22:59.753
-You were the victim of a horrible crime.
-I'm not a victim, Jack.

23:00.837 --> 23:01.838
I'm a survivor.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.216
Follow my lead.

23:07.594 --> 23:09.805
-[gentle music playing]
-[Jack] Here.

23:16.311 --> 23:18.772
[Brady] There's a whole
world of sandwiches out there, Jeb.

23:18.855 --> 23:22.359
You got your, uh, ham and cheese,
pastrami on rye, tuna melt.

23:22.442 --> 23:23.652
Take it up with Pauline.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.780
Listen, I didn't mean
to put you in a bad spot yesterday.

23:26.863 --> 23:28.949
It's just when I heard
about all the dough that's--

23:29.032 --> 23:30.033
Jeb. Jeb.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.787
I don't think you really know
what's happening here.

23:33.870 --> 23:36.957
Even with this job,
I barely got two pennies to rub together.

23:37.040 --> 23:37.958
Okay?

23:38.041 --> 23:40.710
Look, I'm no dealer,
but I've seen your place.

23:40.794 --> 23:41.795
What you drive.

23:43.338 --> 23:45.298
I've got Annabelle to think about too.

23:45.382 --> 23:46.633
I got no choice.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.635
I have to do this.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.139
Okay.

23:53.682 --> 23:54.850
Okay, but, look.

23:56.893 --> 23:59.271
These guys aren't messing around, okay?

23:59.771 --> 24:02.607
So something comes up, anything comes up,

24:03.150 --> 24:04.234
come to me first.

24:04.818 --> 24:06.278
-Got it?
-Mmm-hmm.

24:06.361 --> 24:07.195
Yeah.

24:08.321 --> 24:09.573
[phone chimes]

24:12.200 --> 24:13.368
[Jeb] Is that the boss?

24:13.910 --> 24:16.496
[Brady] No. It's, uh, the girlfriend.

24:17.497 --> 24:20.000
Apparently, we're going on
a double date tonight,

24:20.083 --> 24:21.960
and I gotta tell her I can't make it.

24:22.711 --> 24:24.171
[Jeb laughs] I can man the fort.

24:24.921 --> 24:27.757
-You sure?
-Until you get back, heck, yeah.

24:29.718 --> 24:32.137
All right. All right, man. I owe you.

24:32.220 --> 24:35.223
No, no, no, no, no.
No, hey, you don't owe me nothing.

24:35.891 --> 24:36.725
All right?

24:37.517 --> 24:40.479
You watch my back, buddy,
and I'll watch yours.

24:46.526 --> 24:48.111
-[Mel] Hey.
-[Preacher] Hey.

24:48.195 --> 24:49.446
Is Jack back yet?

24:49.529 --> 24:52.657
-Nah, he's still out hiking with Brie.
-Oh.

24:52.741 --> 24:53.658
-You okay?
-Yeah.

24:53.742 --> 24:55.702
I just feel like
a little bit of a failure.

24:55.785 --> 24:57.162
That makes two of us.

24:57.245 --> 25:00.207
Jack told me about Paige.
I am really sorry.

25:00.832 --> 25:02.375
I've been here seven years, Mel.

25:02.459 --> 25:05.003
I want to get married, start a family.

25:05.086 --> 25:07.464
Just feels like
I'm looking in all the wrong places.

25:07.547 --> 25:10.592
-Well, what are you looking for?
-I want what my folks have.

25:11.593 --> 25:12.469
A soul mate.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.347
I don't know.
I guess I'm just old-fashioned.

25:16.515 --> 25:17.349
How did they meet?

25:17.432 --> 25:20.268
My father, he was in the Coast Guard,
stationed down in Charleston.

25:20.352 --> 25:21.728
One day, he's on the beach,

25:21.811 --> 25:23.522
and he sees
a woman get caught in a riptide.

25:23.605 --> 25:26.983
Swam out, saved her life.
They have been inseparable ever since.

25:28.068 --> 25:29.611
-Wow.
-[Preacher laughs]

25:29.694 --> 25:32.656
Preach, the timer went off.
What do you want me to do with this?

25:32.739 --> 25:35.325
Do you want to try
my mom's famous mac and cheese?

25:35.408 --> 25:38.119
Oh, yeah.
I'm gonna go with yes on that. Yeah.

25:40.121 --> 25:41.122
Thank you.

25:41.623 --> 25:42.499
What?

25:42.582 --> 25:43.959
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

25:44.751 --> 25:45.961
[exclaims]

25:49.506 --> 25:50.590
-Voilà.
-Thanks.

25:50.674 --> 25:52.926
-I had really good timing today.
-[laughs]

25:57.264 --> 25:59.057
-Oh my God.
-[Preacher chuckling]

25:59.766 --> 26:01.268
Oh my God. Is that lobster?

26:01.351 --> 26:02.477
No, that is blue crab.

26:02.561 --> 26:05.397
Now, that part is my addition,
but it is my mom's recipe.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.857
Been thinking about adding
a few of her dishes to the menu.

26:07.941 --> 26:10.151
Kind of an "elevated comfort food"
sort of thing.

26:10.235 --> 26:11.319
[Mel] Mmm-hmm.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.696
I've been feeling lost all day,

26:12.779 --> 26:15.198
so I just wanted to cook something
that made me feel good.

26:15.282 --> 26:18.493
When I was in Iraq, it was lonely.
So I would scrounge up whatever I could.

26:18.577 --> 26:19.953
Make one of her recipes.

26:20.036 --> 26:22.497
Felt like my mom
was there with me, like home.

26:23.707 --> 26:24.624
Still does.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.586
Excuse me, and I will be right back.

26:27.669 --> 26:28.670
Okay. Sure.

26:29.546 --> 26:31.548
[pensive music playing]

26:38.805 --> 26:40.056
[knock on door]

26:42.350 --> 26:45.270
-[Lizzie] How's the head?
-[sighs] A little better. Thanks.

26:48.398 --> 26:49.357
What's that?

26:50.734 --> 26:51.568
Oh.

26:56.197 --> 27:00.160
"In honor of Hope McCrea,
the first mayor of Virgin River."

27:00.243 --> 27:02.370
I didn't know you were the first mayor.

27:02.454 --> 27:03.413
[Hope] First and only.

27:03.496 --> 27:06.583
When I moved here,
Virgin River was what's called

27:06.666 --> 27:09.085
"an unincorporated community."

27:10.503 --> 27:14.674
But when more and more people
started turning up, our needs changed.

27:15.216 --> 27:19.471
We needed a post office, a general store.

27:20.013 --> 27:21.973
So I wrote up a charter…

27:23.099 --> 27:25.685
and suddenly, we needed a mayor.

27:26.394 --> 27:28.688
I didn't even run. I was nominated.

27:28.772 --> 27:30.857
Elected unanimously.

27:30.940 --> 27:33.109
And I've been doing it ever since.

27:33.193 --> 27:34.235
[Lizzie] Whoa.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.529
Being mayor of this town…

27:39.282 --> 27:41.076
it's not what I do, it's…

27:42.160 --> 27:43.370
who I am.

27:43.453 --> 27:46.748
The accident took so much from me,
but my job

27:46.831 --> 27:50.710
was the one part of my identity
the TBI couldn't touch.

27:51.836 --> 27:52.837
Maybe that's…

27:53.963 --> 27:58.218
why I care so much about it,
why I won't go down without a fight.

27:58.301 --> 28:00.303
[somber music playing]

28:03.181 --> 28:04.182
[clears throat]

28:06.309 --> 28:08.228
Why are you looking at me like that?

28:08.812 --> 28:10.271
Well, that's your speech.

28:11.189 --> 28:13.400
Lizzie's right.
You should just speak from the heart.

28:13.483 --> 28:15.860
That's not exactly my specialty.

28:15.944 --> 28:18.154
Well, it sounded pretty good just now.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.740
Want to try it one more time?

28:23.326 --> 28:26.329
-[indistinct chatter]
-[country music playing on radio]

28:27.414 --> 28:28.540
[Mel] Hey!

28:28.623 --> 28:30.208
-[Jack] Hey, you.
-Hey.

28:32.877 --> 28:33.753
Hi.

28:36.339 --> 28:37.215
Mmm.

28:39.592 --> 28:40.844
What was that for?

28:41.636 --> 28:42.804
For being there for my sister.

28:44.973 --> 28:47.475
I don't know, maybe if I hadn't of…
[sighs]

28:47.559 --> 28:50.270
…been so caught up with Charmaine,
and the twins, and…

28:50.353 --> 28:53.690
Maybe I would've had more time for her.
Maybe she would've told me sooner.

28:53.773 --> 28:56.359
No, Brie decided to tell you
when the time was right for her.

28:56.443 --> 28:57.736
Yeah, I know. I just…

28:58.903 --> 29:01.948
I don't feel like I've really
been there for her lately, you know?

29:02.031 --> 29:03.032
Or anyone.

29:03.950 --> 29:07.036
-Why, you think because of Charmaine?
-Yeah, it kills me.

29:07.120 --> 29:09.205
It just…
[sighs] Like, when is this gonna end?

29:09.289 --> 29:11.666
Probably not until you forgive her.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.376
Oh, you think I should forgive her?

29:13.460 --> 29:15.920
Until you get some real closure,

29:16.546 --> 29:19.591
she's never gonna be
out of your life. Or ours.

29:19.674 --> 29:23.303
-I mean, even if she's not around.
-How do you forgive the unforgivable?

29:23.386 --> 29:27.140
You start by taking responsibility
for your part.

29:27.223 --> 29:29.350
Well, hold on. Whose side are you on here?

29:29.434 --> 29:31.352
-Yours! Come on.
-It doesn't sound like it!

29:31.436 --> 29:33.897
-Always, honey. Always.
-But?

29:33.980 --> 29:35.106
But…

29:35.774 --> 29:38.026
For, you know, two years,

29:38.109 --> 29:40.820
Charmaine was convinced
that you had a future together.

29:41.488 --> 29:45.325
Oh, come on. I never once said that
I was interested in something long-term.

29:45.408 --> 29:47.327
No, I… I know you didn't. I know.

29:47.410 --> 29:49.078
Just hear me out, okay? You…

29:50.205 --> 29:54.334
I think because
you don't like letting people down,

29:54.417 --> 29:56.669
that a part of you let her believe that.

29:56.753 --> 29:57.962
[Jack grunts]

29:59.339 --> 30:02.884
I mean, maybe forgiveness
is gonna help you both move on.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.011
You think she deserves it?

30:05.094 --> 30:06.429
Maybe, maybe not.

30:07.347 --> 30:08.640
But I know that you do.

30:09.891 --> 30:13.186
-Okay.
-Oh, hey, Preacher made something.

30:13.269 --> 30:15.855
I mean, it's… amazing.

30:15.939 --> 30:18.399
Do you mind grabbing some
so we can bring it to Brie's?

30:18.483 --> 30:19.984
Sure. I mean, wow, what is it?

30:20.068 --> 30:23.029
-It's your newest signature dish.
-Ooh, intriguing.

30:23.112 --> 30:23.947
Yes.

30:24.030 --> 30:25.615
Yeah, all right. Thanks.

30:25.698 --> 30:26.825
I'll see you later.

30:28.910 --> 30:30.912
[upbeat music playing]

30:32.413 --> 30:33.623
[knock on door]

30:33.706 --> 30:35.416
-[Doc] Yep.
-[door opens]

30:38.962 --> 30:39.796
We need to talk.

30:44.300 --> 30:45.301
Okay, talk.

30:46.135 --> 30:49.222
I understand you're
getting used to life without Mel, and…

30:49.931 --> 30:52.308
I own the part
that I played in her resignation.

30:52.392 --> 30:55.937
I am sorry, I truly am.
But you hired me to be a doctor.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.398
I know you've known me
since I was a boy, but…

30:59.858 --> 31:01.234
I'm a doctor now.

31:02.193 --> 31:03.403
And I'm a damn good one.

31:03.486 --> 31:07.699
I was right about Bert, and I'm gonna help
a whole lot of people in this town.

31:07.782 --> 31:09.492
When we're at work, I would appreciate it

31:09.576 --> 31:12.287
if you drop the patronizing tone
and talk to me like a man.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.083
Is that it?

31:18.209 --> 31:19.210
That's it.

31:28.094 --> 31:29.596
I apologize, Dr. Hayek.

31:32.056 --> 31:33.600
And I appreciate your honesty.

31:33.683 --> 31:35.643
You are absolutely right.

31:38.354 --> 31:39.480
Thank you.

31:39.564 --> 31:43.276
But the fact is, Mel is irreplaceable.

31:43.359 --> 31:46.946
So we are gonna have to figure out
some way to pick up the slack--

31:47.030 --> 31:48.781
-Yeah.
-[woman humming indistinctly]

31:48.865 --> 31:50.950
-[dishes plinking faintly]
-What the hell?

31:53.703 --> 31:55.705
[humming continues]

31:58.082 --> 31:59.500
-[Muriel] Hi!
-Hey.

31:59.584 --> 32:01.961
[Muriel] Oh,
I finished filing all those claims,

32:02.045 --> 32:03.630
and I know you didn't ask,

32:03.713 --> 32:07.175
but I digitized the AMCHARTs as well.

32:07.258 --> 32:09.510
You've got a fresh pot of coffee on.
You were out.

32:09.594 --> 32:13.222
So I ran home, and I picked up
this blend that I bought at Myrtle Farms.

32:13.306 --> 32:14.933
-[sniffing]
-[Muriel] Oh my gosh, yes!

32:15.016 --> 32:17.352
-Can you smell it? It smells like heaven.
-[both exclaim]

32:17.435 --> 32:18.728
[Doc chuckles and claps]

32:18.811 --> 32:19.854
Oh, Muriel.

32:21.105 --> 32:24.192
Would you have any interest
in part-time employment?

32:24.943 --> 32:26.361
Oh! [laughs]

32:27.320 --> 32:28.321
Sure.

32:29.364 --> 32:30.573
[both laugh]

32:30.657 --> 32:32.659
[tranquil music playing]

32:40.667 --> 32:43.711
Look, I wanted to apologize for earlier.
I didn't mean to overstep.

32:43.795 --> 32:46.631
Oh my God, please.
I got weird and overreacted.

32:46.714 --> 32:48.174
No. No, not at all.

32:49.467 --> 32:53.137
I've also had fertility issues myself,
so this kind of thing is…

32:53.221 --> 32:55.807
-[baby coos]
-It's sensitive. [laughs]

32:57.684 --> 32:59.060
It's my baggage, though,

32:59.143 --> 33:01.854
and I didn't mean
to insert myself in your decision.

33:04.440 --> 33:05.817
Thanks for wanting to help.

33:06.484 --> 33:07.318
[Mel] Yeah.

33:10.071 --> 33:12.198
You know,
Mom would have loved all of this.

33:14.033 --> 33:15.994
I lost my mom to cancer too.

33:16.577 --> 33:17.578
I'm so sorry.

33:19.914 --> 33:22.709
I miss her most
when big things happen in my life.

33:22.792 --> 33:24.627
-[baby babbles]
-Yeah.

33:25.253 --> 33:27.630
Especially when it comes to being a mom.

33:28.172 --> 33:30.508
You asked earlier
if I was planning on having kids?

33:31.926 --> 33:32.969
Never in a million years.

33:34.929 --> 33:37.473
But when I walked out of
Dr. Kane's office this morning,

33:38.099 --> 33:39.475
my stomach was in knots.

33:39.976 --> 33:42.729
All I could think about was my mom.

33:43.229 --> 33:47.483
I loved her,
but we just saw the world so differently.

33:48.067 --> 33:49.902
Being a mom was her whole life.

33:50.778 --> 33:54.574
And I thought that that was kinda… small.

33:56.534 --> 33:59.787
But coming back home, seeing this garden,

34:00.580 --> 34:02.415
being with Chloe, I don't know.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.627
Maybe I'm not ready to close the door
on all that quite yet.

34:08.629 --> 34:11.299
I didn't think
she had anything left to teach me.

34:11.382 --> 34:12.967
But since this morning…

34:15.720 --> 34:17.680
I would do anything
to hear what she had to say.

34:20.141 --> 34:22.852
Hey, if you ever want to talk, I'm here.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.106
I just want you to know
you're not alone in this.

34:30.151 --> 34:31.110
Thank you, Mel.

34:31.903 --> 34:32.862
Neither are you.

34:36.866 --> 34:39.285
[Hope] Virgin River is like an orchestra.

34:39.368 --> 34:42.872
Individually,
we play our parts, but together…

34:44.248 --> 34:46.042
we form a symphony.

34:47.418 --> 34:50.004
This garden is a tribute to…

34:51.798 --> 34:54.467
everything this town stands for.

34:54.550 --> 34:56.219
To those who came before,

34:56.302 --> 35:00.014
to those who will someday
plant seeds of their own,

35:00.098 --> 35:04.352
and to the roles we play
to make Virgin River flourish.

35:04.435 --> 35:07.313
In closing, some of you
are starting to doubt

35:07.396 --> 35:09.565
I'm still the right person
to lead this town.
