00:02.002 --> 00:04.994
"Amigo Bronco " playing

00:25.442 --> 00:27.728
( man singing in Spanish,
echoing )

00:36.036 --> 00:37.992
( music playing )

00:42.834 --> 00:44.449
(wind whistling )

00:44.503 --> 00:46.494
( metal squeaking )

00:53.428 --> 00:56.556
- ( breathing heavily)
( muffled music continues )

00:56.598 --> 00:59.260
( voice echoing )

01:07.109 --> 01:09.395
She had to lose sometime.

01:14.283 --> 01:16.239
( muffled music
conﬁnues)

01:27.588 --> 01:29.294
( music playing )

01:29.381 --> 01:31.667
She is gone.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.007
But he had to lose sometime.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.762
( muffled music
conﬁnues)

01:43.437 --> 01:46.270
( infected snarling )

01:52.154 --> 01:54.770
( snarling )

01:57.951 --> 02:00.784
( snarling )

02:14.468 --> 02:16.424
( music playing )

02:22.643 --> 02:24.224
( roars )

02:29.316 --> 02:31.227
No! No! No!

02:31.276 --> 02:33.267

02:33.320 --> 02:35.777
(barking, growling )

02:41.078 --> 02:42.693

02:42.746 --> 02:44.577

02:48.043 --> 02:50.375
(laughing )

03:14.236 --> 03:16.318
( infected snarling )

03:20.158 --> 03:23.116
(snarling continues )

03:30.877 --> 03:31.957
( loud thump )

03:33.004 --> 03:34.380
( infected snarls )

03:35.882 --> 03:38.749
With this holy unction
and His tender mercy.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.890
No!
( screaming )

03:52.816 --> 03:55.353
Get off me! Go away!
What do you want?! Go away!

03:55.485 --> 03:57.316
Relax, old man.

03:57.446 --> 03:58.856
What do you want from me?

03:58.989 --> 03:59.978
Relax.

04:07.456 --> 04:09.663
You are looking
a little shaky there, brother.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.828
It had me, but it let me go.

04:14.629 --> 04:17.462
Yeah, I wouldn't go for that, either.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.330
What is your name?

04:25.015 --> 04:27.131
Well, Daniel, I am Efrain.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.303
And you...

04:29.436 --> 04:30.721
you are dying.

04:33.190 --> 04:35.897
Efrain, water. Water.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.943
Calma, calma.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.909
I have got good news and bad news.

04:45.410 --> 04:48.152
The good news is I do have water,
and I am happy to give you some.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.538
But the bad news
is we are going to have to walk.

04:53.251 --> 04:54.240
So...

04:55.712 --> 04:56.827
What do you say, brother?

05:00.801 --> 05:02.007
Bueno, bueno.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.088
( music playing )

05:05.889 --> 05:09.131
( muttering in Spanish )

05:22.739 --> 05:24.821
El agua.

05:24.866 --> 05:26.402
Agua.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.736
Agua.

05:32.624 --> 05:33.784
It is dry.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.661
Are you joking?

05:37.003 --> 05:39.540
-Where is the water?
-It shouldn’t be much longer now.

05:40.715 --> 05:41.841
What are you?

05:43.051 --> 05:45.007
Me? I am the fifth Beat/e. You?

05:45.929 --> 05:47.044
You bastard.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.053
( motor whirs )
( water burbles )

05:49.266 --> 05:50.346
There we are.

05:50.809 --> 05:51.798
Here it comes.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.635
(gasps )

05:57.190 --> 06:00.682
Go easy. You don’t want to get sick.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.612
(spits, coughs )

06:09.995 --> 06:11.075
Where is it coming from?

06:11.204 --> 06:13.866
Every Tuesday, 5:00 pm,

06:13.999 --> 06:15.114
a little miracle.

06:16.835 --> 06:19.793
Daniel,
I know someone that can help you,

06:19.921 --> 06:21.206
but you have to hold on.

06:23.008 --> 06:24.794
Man's voice over stereo:
Agua, agua.

06:24.843 --> 06:27.505
( music playing )

06:31.516 --> 06:34.383
Agua, agua.

06:34.436 --> 06:36.392
( infected snarling )

06:40.358 --> 06:42.064
(speaks Spanish )

06:42.110 --> 06:43.350
Agua, agua.

06:45.196 --> 06:46.652
(yelps )

06:47.866 --> 06:49.231
Agua, agua.

06:49.326 --> 06:51.157
-To the right, stairs!
-Hold on!

06:54.080 --> 06:55.786
Agua, agua.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.790
( both shouting in Spanish )

07:07.427 --> 07:09.008
Agua, agua.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.473
Efra, where the hell were you?

07:15.602 --> 07:17.888
Revo/ucio'n is overrun.
I had to ride around.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.386
Lola? Have you seen her?

07:19.522 --> 07:20.728
Haven’t seen her.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.477
li/Iy leg!

07:23.610 --> 07:25.566
- Shh!
- (groans)

07:27.447 --> 07:29.028
( metal squeaking )

07:36.122 --> 07:37.658
They are coming more often.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.617
(gasps )
Daniel.

07:43.338 --> 07:44.544
Daniel.

07:46.424 --> 07:47.755
( distantly )
Daniel.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.761
He needs antibiotics, Lola.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.308
His pants are stuck to his leg.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.102
He is rotting.

08:01.231 --> 08:03.472
Precisely. We have to clean it now.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.896
We will have to scrape it clean.
He will probably lose it anyway.

08:07.445 --> 08:08.651
I have seen worse.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.696
Please, Lola.

08:13.868 --> 08:18.077
My wild horse
that ran faster than a train.

08:22.085 --> 08:23.746
Who left, Mr. Daniel?

08:23.878 --> 08:27.336
Help me.
It is stuck and I can 't get it out.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.165
So you are a Bronco fan, huh?

08:30.301 --> 08:31.962
I detest them.

08:33.138 --> 08:34.753
They are not that bad.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.146
What are you going to do?

08:53.700 --> 08:55.486
It takes a steady hand.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.203
Try not to scream.
You will draw them.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.634
( Lola singing in Spanish )

09:22.145 --> 09:24.010
(singing along in Spanish )

09:38.369 --> 09:41.327
( Daniel screaming )

09:44.167 --> 09:45.122
( screaming echoes )

09:47.045 --> 09:49.206
(wind whistling )

10:01.309 --> 10:04.301
( music playing )

10:17.617 --> 10:19.733
( infected snarling )

10:19.786 --> 10:21.242
Daniel! Hurry up, old man!

10:21.371 --> 10:22.611
Hurry up, old man!

10:23.957 --> 10:25.322
-A nail!
-Where are they?

10:25.458 --> 10:26.447
There, the bag!

10:27.544 --> 10:29.250
Longer. This one has got a big head.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.497
With this holy unction
and His tender mercy...

10:35.593 --> 10:38.300
...may the Lord pardon all your sins.

10:38.429 --> 10:40.010
- ( grunts )
- (snarling stops )

10:41.975 --> 10:45.058
See? I should have been a carpenter.

10:51.860 --> 10:52.975
Were you a priest?

10:55.780 --> 10:56.769
Priest?

10:58.241 --> 10:59.526
l have been many things.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.742
But then I found my calling.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.623
Efrain:
You want this?

11:16.676 --> 11:20.385
(speaking Spanish )

11:28.980 --> 11:30.311
( music playing )

11:30.356 --> 11:31.766
( crickets chirping )

11:31.816 --> 11:33.192
( door opens )

11:41.451 --> 11:42.657
Come in, come in.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.324
In this home...

11:45.538 --> 11:47.324
...a/I are welcome.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.255
( Spanish continues )

12:04.390 --> 12:06.676
You have been
very kind to me, Efrain.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.560
-Please, brother.
-No, really.

12:11.940 --> 12:14.727
You didn’t have to help me,
but you did.

12:27.997 --> 12:31.910
When was the last time
a professional cut your hair?

12:35.171 --> 12:36.035
( music playing
on stereo )

12:36.089 --> 12:38.626
Stay still, we are almost done.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.223
It had been a while
since I saw myself.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.145
Gracias.

13:04.492 --> 13:05.481
So...

13:06.703 --> 13:08.568
What time are you
going to sneak out on me?

13:11.082 --> 13:12.367
I don't know much,

13:12.500 --> 13:14.582
but I do know something
about running.

13:14.711 --> 13:17.828
And something is rotting in you
far worse than your leg.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.134
I am not a good man.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.006
I have done terrible things.

13:28.683 --> 13:31.299
I am afraid it is time...

13:32.520 --> 13:34.021
...to pay my debts.

13:37.191 --> 13:38.522
What did you do?

13:40.236 --> 13:42.477
I have killed... many people.

13:43.906 --> 13:44.941
How many?

13:48.077 --> 13:49.328
Ninety-six.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.165
Mother of God.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.872
But that is not
what is weighing on you.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.803
I left El Salvador...

14:14.395 --> 14:15.555
( music playing )

14:15.605 --> 14:19.393
...with my wife and my baby girl,

14:19.525 --> 14:20.981
to Los Ange/es.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.233
New life, new country.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.771
The ofﬁcer became a barber.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.156
And my daughter,

14:29.285 --> 14:32.777
she grew up beside me her whole life

14:32.914 --> 14:34.745
and I never told her the truth.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.373
You were right to keep it from her.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.212
That burden was yours.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.503
Is it her you are looking for?

14:56.646 --> 14:59.353
We were in a house,
surrounded by death.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.984
I was trying to protect her. I swear.

15:08.783 --> 15:09.772
But...

15:10.952 --> 15:12.283
...my mind wasn't right.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.280
I woke up in a ﬁre.

15:19.460 --> 15:20.700
And I heard her...

15:21.712 --> 15:22.963
...ca/Iing me.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.294
I was trapped.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.551
l was burning.

15:33.391 --> 15:35.097
The ceiling was collapsing.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.435
I fought, and I fought,
and I got out.

15:40.898 --> 15:42.513
I don’t know how, but I got out.

15:44.735 --> 15:45.941
And then I collapsed.

15:49.824 --> 15:52.110
And when I came to...

15:54.162 --> 15:56.619
( thunder rumbling )

15:57.582 --> 15:59.197
...no one was left alive.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.998
All burned.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.540
What are you saying, Daniel?

16:13.347 --> 16:14.598
[don’t know if...

16:15.683 --> 16:17.344
...I burned my daughter alive.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.219
How can you not know?

16:23.941 --> 16:24.976
Forgive me,

16:25.109 --> 16:27.316
like you forgive
those things out there.

16:27.904 --> 16:30.816
-Forgive me, too.
-Old man, who am I to forgive you?

16:30.948 --> 16:32.529
Please, forgive me!

16:37.955 --> 16:39.286
Easy, old man.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.994
Shh, Shh.

16:42.043 --> 16:44.034
(whispering in Spanish )

16:45.087 --> 16:46.463
( music playing )

16:47.089 --> 16:48.499
I have got good news...

16:51.677 --> 16:53.087
...and bad news.

16:55.890 --> 17:00.259
The good news is there is nobody left
in this world to judge you.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.429
The bad news...

17:06.526 --> 17:08.812
( Spanish continues )

17:08.861 --> 17:11.102
( thunder rolling )

17:11.155 --> 17:13.316
( snores softly )

17:16.410 --> 17:19.368
( thunder rolling )

17:19.413 --> 17:21.699
( snoring continues )

17:35.596 --> 17:37.837
- ( rain pouring)
- (thunder crashes )

17:40.351 --> 17:42.637
( music playing )

17:48.693 --> 17:51.105
(thunder crashing )

17:52.697 --> 17:55.188
( infected snarling )

17:56.409 --> 17:57.615
You hungry?

17:59.036 --> 18:00.025
You hungry?

18:00.162 --> 18:01.197
Well, eat shit!

18:02.665 --> 18:04.246
(thunder crashing )

18:04.292 --> 18:07.284
( infected growling )

18:37.450 --> 18:40.112
Holy Mary, mother of God.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.124
( thunder crashes )

19:11.692 --> 19:14.604
I covered for you
when you snuck out to see your girl.

19:14.737 --> 19:16.193
That is how it is going to be?

19:17.448 --> 19:18.733
( chuckles )

19:19.241 --> 19:20.401
I will flip you for it.

19:22.703 --> 19:23.943
-Tails!
-Heads!

19:26.749 --> 19:28.159
( laughs )

19:36.717 --> 19:39.129
(flies buzzing )

19:40.471 --> 19:42.712
Eve, help me out. It is stuck.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.464
-Leave me alone.
-Just help me pull it free, fatso!

19:47.478 --> 19:50.891
(straining )

19:50.940 --> 19:53.556
( muttering in Spanish )

19:57.530 --> 19:59.862
(grunting )

20:03.911 --> 20:04.900
Ay...

20:04.995 --> 20:06.075
Holy...

20:09.333 --> 20:11.324
He looks like you.

20:11.836 --> 20:13.372
( both laugh )

20:13.421 --> 20:16.959
- ( both screaming )
- (shouting in Spanish )

20:18.801 --> 20:20.132
We have to get him out of here.

20:20.636 --> 20:24.675
They will think we snuck him in.
They will think we are the thieves.

20:24.807 --> 20:26.297
So we just tell the truth.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.224
They are going to kill us.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.304
We found him in the sewer
with a corpse.

20:33.441 --> 20:34.897
It is a miracle he is alive.

20:35.109 --> 20:36.974
Daniel? What are you doing here?

20:38.487 --> 20:42.446
-Should we sneak him out?
-No. You were right to hide him.

20:42.575 --> 20:45.191
If they see him, they will kill him.
And then you.

20:45.327 --> 20:46.362
Now what?

20:47.747 --> 20:49.453
( music playing )

20:52.877 --> 20:54.708
Welcome to the Gonzalez Dam.

20:55.296 --> 20:57.161
It works with gas-powered generators.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.755
It is practically fully operational.

20:59.884 --> 21:03.047
If it is still working,
why is everybody dying of thirst?

21:03.179 --> 21:04.760
When Tijuana fell,

21:04.889 --> 21:07.676
it was taken over by the Municipal
President, Dante Esquivel.

21:08.601 --> 21:09.716
My new boss.

21:09.852 --> 21:14.721
He is distributing water -
how to put it - his way.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.988
(water dripping )

21:25.034 --> 21:27.320
How much control do you have
over the water flow?

21:29.038 --> 21:31.871
I need to be sure we understand
each other. You don’t know me.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.081
Today is the ﬁrst day
you have ever seen me.

21:34.585 --> 21:38.373
You came to ask -
to beg - for work. Am I clear?

21:39.590 --> 21:40.579
Like water.

21:44.178 --> 21:47.591
Who... Who the hell is this?
And what the hell is he doing here?

21:48.974 --> 21:50.430
Daniel, this is J. C.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.675
He is Mr. Esquivel's
head of security.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.222
This is the new janitor.

21:54.355 --> 21:56.220
Since when do we need more janitors?

21:56.357 --> 21:58.439
There are many bodies
in my dam from the storm.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.068
My boys have their hands full.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.021
Let's see what the boss says.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.237
Do you know what rotting flesh does
to drinking water?

22:05.741 --> 22:08.357
No, because your job is security.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.860
And mine is water treatment.

22:12.456 --> 22:15.493
So why don ’t you go and do
what bodyguards do...

22:16.585 --> 22:19.076
...and let me do myjob.

22:32.643 --> 22:34.884
( music playing )

22:40.359 --> 22:42.816
( distant chatter )

22:43.821 --> 22:46.278
So that is how the famous
"distribution " works.

22:47.449 --> 22:48.529
Just like that.

22:49.577 --> 22:51.158
( infected snarling )

22:51.245 --> 22:52.610
You have no problem with that?

22:52.746 --> 22:56.534
Look, buddy, better on this side
of the fence than that one, no?

22:56.667 --> 22:57.656
You sure about that?

22:57.793 --> 22:58.873
Work is work.

22:59.336 --> 23:02.544
It is this, get eaten, or get shot.

23:06.635 --> 23:07.624
So?

23:08.345 --> 23:09.676
What is it going to be?

23:09.805 --> 23:11.966
( snarling )

23:16.020 --> 23:17.351
( squelches )

23:17.396 --> 23:19.808
( chatter )

23:23.569 --> 23:24.854
Don ’t you want a soda?

23:25.571 --> 23:27.107
No, gracias.

23:28.866 --> 23:31.903
( door opens, closes)

23:33.954 --> 23:35.819
Are you crazy? Stand up!

23:35.956 --> 23:37.287
Please, sit down.

23:38.167 --> 23:39.282
Please, sit down.

23:40.085 --> 23:41.370
Jefe.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.679
Why the hell don’t you stand
when the boss enters?

24:02.608 --> 24:04.644
Was that the boss? I didn’t know.

24:06.195 --> 24:07.935
When the boss comes in, you stand up.

24:10.074 --> 24:11.860
And when I am talking to you,

24:11.992 --> 24:13.528
you look at me, asshole.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.279
Understand?

24:24.838 --> 24:26.419
(grunting )

24:27.508 --> 24:28.497
(gun cocks)

24:28.550 --> 24:30.211
J. C.! What the hell?

24:30.344 --> 24:32.585
This insubordinate prick

24:32.721 --> 24:34.302
just stabbed me with his fork.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.719
(gasps )

24:38.978 --> 24:39.967
I was just eating.

24:42.022 --> 24:43.228
What did you say?

24:43.983 --> 24:46.474
-Say it again.
-I was just eating.

24:47.987 --> 24:48.976
What is your name?

24:51.615 --> 24:53.401
Daniel Salazar.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.328
And where are you from,
Daniel Salazar?

24:59.456 --> 25:00.662
From San Salvador.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.254
Sergeant Salazar?

25:11.552 --> 25:13.463
NCO Salazar?

25:17.266 --> 25:18.551
Lieutenant Salazar?

25:24.690 --> 25:26.555
Ah!

25:26.608 --> 25:27.859
(speaks Spanish )

25:37.453 --> 25:38.488
Sombra Negra.

25:41.540 --> 25:42.746
Damn it, J. C.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.206
How many times do I have to tell you?

25:45.753 --> 25:46.833
You have got to read.

25:47.463 --> 25:50.421
You are picking a ﬁght
with a killer,

25:50.549 --> 25:52.255
trained by the CIA.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.299
You fought in the civil war.

25:59.224 --> 26:00.339
Yes, sir.

26:02.144 --> 26:03.805
How many communists did you kill?

26:07.649 --> 26:08.934
I lost count.

26:10.652 --> 26:13.143
( chuckles )

26:14.948 --> 26:16.233
Gentlemen, move over.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.156
We have a guest.

26:19.369 --> 26:20.620
Please, Ofﬁcer.

26:21.455 --> 26:23.662
( music playing )

26:38.597 --> 26:42.385
I have got some shitty little rats
that come and steal my water.

26:42.518 --> 26:45.555
I would happily negotiate with them,

26:45.687 --> 26:48.019
but then, if I let a few drink,
others will come.

26:49.149 --> 26:52.016
And what matters here
is guaranteeing order.

26:54.196 --> 26:56.027
This may be the apocalypse...

26:57.908 --> 26:59.614
...but it is not communism.

27:02.871 --> 27:04.657
Tell me, Ofﬁcer,

27:04.790 --> 27:05.870
what do you want?

27:06.917 --> 27:08.032
What do you need?

27:11.255 --> 27:12.791
I don’t know what you want me to say.

27:13.257 --> 27:14.622
Please, speak freely.

27:21.849 --> 27:23.339
Could you lend me a jeep?

27:24.726 --> 27:25.715
A jeep ?

27:25.853 --> 27:27.184
I am looking for someone.

27:29.898 --> 27:31.638
If you want a jeep,
I will lend you one,

27:31.775 --> 27:34.357
but, if you don’t mind me saying,

27:34.486 --> 27:36.272
what are you going to do out there?

27:37.406 --> 27:40.364
A man of your talents deserves more.
Stay here.

27:40.993 --> 27:41.982
Help me.

27:42.578 --> 27:44.944
And if you solve my problem,

27:45.080 --> 27:48.163
I will give you a place
worthy of your stature.

27:54.882 --> 27:56.213
You have my word.

27:59.136 --> 28:01.297
( music playing )

28:13.734 --> 28:16.441
So, you are looking for one
single thief in all of Tijuana?

28:16.945 --> 28:19.561
A thief, a pipe, a faucet.

28:19.698 --> 28:20.858
Someone is robbing us.

28:28.624 --> 28:29.613
Look.

28:36.048 --> 28:37.037
Hold tight!

28:46.642 --> 28:48.724
( music playing )

29:03.325 --> 29:05.190
(gun cocks)

29:07.829 --> 29:08.818
Dry.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.123
There is nothing here.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.249
Let's go.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.127
Vamonos.

29:31.353 --> 29:33.344
( music playing )

29:49.579 --> 29:51.991
( water gurgling )

30:04.177 --> 30:06.714
Man's voice over stereo:
Agua, agua.

30:06.888 --> 30:09.095
Hey! Over here!
I found something here.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.551
Agua, agua.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.553
There is your water thief.

30:12.644 --> 30:13.929
Agua, agua.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.058
Agua, agua.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.398
Agua, agua.

30:21.903 --> 30:23.439
Agua, agua.

30:23.488 --> 30:25.149
( objects breaking )

30:25.198 --> 30:27.029
Agua, agua.

30:36.209 --> 30:37.244
I had to.

30:39.004 --> 30:40.915
They were going to discover
the fountain.

30:45.010 --> 30:46.716
Son of a bitch.

30:48.638 --> 30:49.673
He saved your life.

30:49.806 --> 30:52.058
Listen to me, damn it.

30:52.184 --> 30:55.176
It is just a matter of time.
I know how this works.

30:56.104 --> 30:59.346
First, they are going to ﬁnd Efrain,
and then they will ﬁnd you,

30:59.483 --> 31:01.348
and they will kill you both.

31:01.485 --> 31:02.474
And you?

31:03.528 --> 31:04.688
Will they kill you?

31:06.615 --> 31:08.901
I did it to protect you.

31:14.748 --> 31:16.454
lfl stop running water...

31:18.293 --> 31:19.578
...they will die.

31:21.129 --> 31:22.118
All of them.

31:29.638 --> 31:30.627
Of thirst.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.756
Then they will ﬁnd you.

31:35.852 --> 31:37.137
And when they do...

31:38.146 --> 31:41.684
...there won’t be anything
I can do to help you.

31:44.569 --> 31:45.820
Dante is right.

31:47.531 --> 31:49.613
This place is perfect for you.

31:51.410 --> 31:52.616
You are a thug.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.699
Go get your prize, thug.

32:00.877 --> 32:02.287
I warned you.

32:02.421 --> 32:03.786
Do what you want.

32:06.425 --> 32:10.213
Just don 't ask me to save people
who are already dead.

32:15.517 --> 32:18.634
( door opens, closes)

32:24.317 --> 32:26.308
( music playing )

32:35.454 --> 32:37.661
(Victor speaking Spanish )

32:41.293 --> 32:43.033
Victor: Hey, Dante's not going
to be happy about...

32:43.086 --> 32:46.044
- (yells)
- (gun cocks)

32:46.089 --> 32:48.000
Hey, you're making
a mistake!

32:48.049 --> 32:49.914
You're making a mistake!

32:59.019 --> 33:00.725
( clanging )

33:09.196 --> 33:10.276
(gasps )

33:10.322 --> 33:11.732
You see?

33:11.781 --> 33:14.944
I told you I would be
your guardian angel.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.359
Or my angel of death.

33:17.412 --> 33:19.698
Daniel...

33:19.748 --> 33:21.204
how'd you get out?

33:21.249 --> 33:23.205
Ofelia...

33:24.461 --> 33:26.417
is she alive?

33:28.423 --> 33:29.833
ls Ofelia alive?

33:29.883 --> 33:31.544
We fled the compound.

33:31.593 --> 33:35.085
Madison, Alicia,
and Ofelia.

33:36.973 --> 33:39.885
She thought you were dead.
We all did.

33:39.935 --> 33:42.847
But...

33:42.896 --> 33:44.978
Daniel...

33:45.023 --> 33:46.103
she is alive.

33:49.778 --> 33:52.144
She's holed up in a hotel
down the coast.

33:52.197 --> 33:54.984
Rosarito. It'll take us
a day to get there.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.273
Maybe less.

33:56.326 --> 33:58.317
( panting )

33:58.370 --> 34:01.954
Hey, get me out of here
and I'll take you to her.

34:03.333 --> 34:05.324
We can get there by morning.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.413
She's waiting for you.

34:16.513 --> 34:17.923
You son of a bitch.

34:19.933 --> 34:21.298
She's waiting for me?

34:22.811 --> 34:24.722
Um... Daniel...

34:24.771 --> 34:26.636
I don't believe you.

34:28.483 --> 34:30.474
What's not to believe?

34:30.527 --> 34:32.688
She survived the fire.
We found the hotel.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.113
What's the matter with you?

34:34.155 --> 34:36.191
You'd say anything
to save your life.

34:36.241 --> 34:37.822
- Daniel, wait...
- You're a snake.

34:37.867 --> 34:39.118
( scoffs )

34:39.160 --> 34:40.741
Vibora.
- Daniel, listen to me.

34:40.787 --> 34:42.743
You're making
a mistake, okay?

34:42.789 --> 34:44.905
Get me out of here.
Let's find her.

34:44.958 --> 34:47.574
This place
is perfect for you.

34:47.627 --> 34:50.209
You will rot here,
like the dead.

34:50.255 --> 34:51.540
Ofelia needs her father.

34:51.590 --> 34:54.457
Ofelia is dead.

34:54.509 --> 34:56.500
Her father is dead.

34:57.679 --> 34:59.385
And so are you.

35:00.682 --> 35:03.139
Daniel!
Daniel, the boss is looking for you!

35:03.268 --> 35:04.633
Hey!

35:04.686 --> 35:06.426
Hey, I saved your life.

35:06.479 --> 35:08.219
I saved her life!
You owe me!

35:11.359 --> 35:12.815
Salazar!

35:15.488 --> 35:17.228
Salazar!

35:17.282 --> 35:19.238
( water dripping )

35:21.119 --> 35:24.532
(punches landing )
( man grunting )

35:26.207 --> 35:27.583
Just in time.

35:27.709 --> 35:28.334
( panting )

35:28.376 --> 35:29.991
Now you are going to talk.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.046
The expert is here.

35:39.679 --> 35:41.761
( water dripping )
( Dante panting )

35:41.890 --> 35:44.381
You just have to tell me

35:44.517 --> 35:47.304
who in here is helping you...

35:47.979 --> 35:49.594
...and then all of this is over.

35:53.318 --> 35:55.855
Tell me, what do you need?

35:56.655 --> 35:58.611
Knives? Pipes? Water?

35:59.908 --> 36:02.615
-I have got a bunch of water.
-Just space.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.083
Efrain...

36:16.716 --> 36:17.922
If you talk...

36:19.135 --> 36:21.217
...they will kill you.

36:23.223 --> 36:25.259
And then her.

36:27.519 --> 36:28.634
If you don 't talk...

36:32.023 --> 36:33.354
...I am going to kill you.

36:35.068 --> 36:38.606
I can only offer to kill you
as fast as I can.

36:41.074 --> 36:44.407
Those options
aren't options, brother.

36:52.001 --> 36:53.081
Forgive me.

36:54.879 --> 36:55.868
Again ?

37:11.646 --> 37:13.887
(grunting )

37:24.242 --> 37:27.325
(coughing )

37:33.585 --> 37:34.574
Confess!

37:34.794 --> 37:37.251
( tooth clatters )

37:37.297 --> 37:39.333
- Confiesa!
(punches landing )

37:42.552 --> 37:45.510
I don’t have anything to confess.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.679
I don't think he will speak,
Mr. Dante.

37:53.354 --> 37:54.480
You keep going.

37:54.981 --> 37:56.312
Trust me, he will speak.

38:20.006 --> 38:22.247
( praying softly
in Spanish )

38:23.927 --> 38:25.918
( music playing )

38:32.352 --> 38:33.512
Enough! Enough!

38:34.145 --> 38:35.351
Leave him alone!

38:36.439 --> 38:37.815
( sobbing )

38:37.857 --> 38:39.848
No, my girl. No.

38:42.987 --> 38:44.852
éPOl' qué?

38:49.410 --> 38:51.241
( Efrain sobs )
éPOl' que' ?

39:01.548 --> 39:02.537
( man panting )

39:02.966 --> 39:04.081
Let them see.

39:04.509 --> 39:06.545
( distant infected snarling )

39:09.180 --> 39:11.466
( screams, gasps )

39:11.516 --> 39:12.972
- (wind whistling)
- Lola: Oh, no.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.803
No,no,no.
No,no,no.

39:15.562 --> 39:16.972
Let this be a lesson.

39:18.815 --> 39:20.521
When you steal water from this dam...

39:21.484 --> 39:22.985
you are stealing from me.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.605
And when you steal from me...

39:27.156 --> 39:28.566
...this is what happens.

39:41.796 --> 39:43.752
(whimpering)

39:48.261 --> 39:50.297
Mr. Dante, I promise I didn't know.

39:50.763 --> 39:51.889
It is all right.

39:52.932 --> 39:53.967
Please! Please!

39:54.767 --> 39:57.349
I just need a messenger pigeon

39:57.478 --> 39:59.764
who will go tell all those bastards

39:59.898 --> 40:01.308
what I just said.

40:01.816 --> 40:05.775
Because what good is a message
without a messenger, right?

40:07.280 --> 40:10.693
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

40:12.118 --> 40:13.449
Fly away, little pigeon!

40:13.494 --> 40:14.700
- ( screams )
- ( screams )

40:14.746 --> 40:16.702
Lola:
No! No.

40:16.748 --> 40:17.954
No.
( infected snarling )

40:17.999 --> 40:19.705
- Sweet Jesus.
- Next.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.412
( Lola sobbing )

40:25.340 --> 40:26.329
Yes, sir.

40:39.979 --> 40:42.686
( breathing heavily )

40:58.581 --> 40:59.696
Ready, Daniel?

41:01.000 --> 41:01.989
Yes, sir.

41:06.923 --> 41:08.129
Come on, Daniel.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.299
All right, J. C., do me the favor.

41:11.344 --> 41:13.005
Si, patro'n.

41:14.263 --> 41:16.174
(gunfire)

41:16.224 --> 41:17.839
( shouts )

41:22.146 --> 41:23.431
No, no, no, no.

41:23.606 --> 41:25.142
I let you...

41:25.274 --> 41:26.650
I let you in.

41:27.276 --> 41:28.527
I pulled you off the street.

41:29.362 --> 41:31.819
You will always be a goddamn dog.

41:56.055 --> 41:58.046
( music playing )

42:00.643 --> 42:01.758
Forgive me.

42:27.128 --> 42:29.790
( music playing )
