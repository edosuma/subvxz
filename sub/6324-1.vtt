04:14.170 --> 04:18.163
<i>In June 1863, after more than two years</i>
<i>of bloody conflict... </i>

04:18.241 --> 04:21.767
<i>... the Confederate army of Northern</i>
<i>Virginia, Robert E. Lee commanding... </i>

04:21.844 --> 04:25.041
<i>... slips across the Potomac</i>
<i>to begin the invasion of the North. </i>

04:25.381 --> 04:27.747
<i>It is an army of 70,000 men. </i>

04:28.351 --> 04:30.478
<i>They move slowly behind the Blue Ridge... </i>

04:30.553 --> 04:32.987
<i>... using the mountains</i>
<i>to screen their movements. </i>

04:33.056 --> 04:36.116
<i>Their objective is to draw</i>
<i>the Union army out into the open... </i>

04:36.192 --> 04:38.092
<i>... where it can be destroyed. </i>

04:38.328 --> 04:42.094
<i>Late in June, the Union army</i>
<i>of the Potomac, 80,000 men... </i>

04:42.332 --> 04:46.132
<i>... turns north from Virginia to begin</i>
<i>the great pursuit up the narrow roads... </i>

04:46.302 --> 04:48.964
<i>... across Maryland and into Pennsylvania. </i>

04:49.339 --> 04:53.435
<i>General Lee knows that a letter has been</i>
<i>prepared by the Southern government. </i>

04:53.509 --> 04:55.443
<i>A letter which offers peace. </i>

04:55.712 --> 04:59.739
<i>It is to be placed on the desk</i>
<i>of Abraham Lincoln, President of the U. S... </i>

05:00.149 --> 05:03.482
<i>... the day after Lee has destroyed</i>
<i>the Army of the Potomac... </i>

05:03.586 --> 05:05.816
<i>... somewhere north of Washington. </i>

06:35.912 --> 06:38.847
Federal cavalry. Two brigades.

07:50.820 --> 07:54.722
- Howdy, friend. Where you headed?
- General Longstreet. I must see him.

07:54.790 --> 07:55.916
Is that a fact?

07:55.992 --> 07:58.859
I know General Lee's headquarters
are up here a little ways.

07:58.928 --> 08:00.862
Wherever he is, Longstreet is nearby.

08:04.500 --> 08:08.334
- Take me that way. This is urgent.
- Let me put it to you like this, stranger.

08:09.138 --> 08:12.699
You're not in a uniform
and you're coming through my picket line.

08:12.775 --> 08:15.869
I'll take you up there,
but if nobody there knows you...

08:16.512 --> 08:19.345
...I guess, unfortunately,
you'll have to be hanged.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.379
Sir. General, sir.

08:52.415 --> 08:55.714
I'm sorry, excuse me, sir,
but Harrison is back.

08:58.588 --> 09:00.180
- Harrison?
- Yes, sir.

09:00.256 --> 09:01.951
The scout, Harrison, sir.

09:02.658 --> 09:05.183
I knew you'd want to know that
as soon as possible.

09:06.062 --> 09:07.962
He's right outside here, sir.

09:15.871 --> 09:17.236
Your servant, General.

09:18.374 --> 09:20.137
Didn't expect to see me, did you?

09:20.309 --> 09:23.745
I paid you in gold three weeks ago.
What do you got?

09:26.716 --> 09:28.946
I don't suppose you got
another one of those.

09:29.118 --> 09:30.642
That good southern tobacco.

09:30.953 --> 09:32.045
What do you got?

09:32.521 --> 09:36.753
I got the position of the Yankee army.
They're only a few miles down the road.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.488
The whole Yankee army coming this way.
Seven corps.

09:40.129 --> 09:41.118
A few miles?

09:41.197 --> 09:44.928
Yes. Two brigades of Yankee cavalry
down that road about...

09:45.268 --> 09:46.997
...two, four hours away.

09:47.069 --> 09:48.934
Behind that there's seven corps.

09:49.272 --> 09:52.537
I put it all on a map, if you'd like to see it.
About 80,000 men.

09:53.042 --> 09:54.634
All seven corps.

09:55.244 --> 09:57.178
You didn't know any of that, General?

09:57.313 --> 09:59.281
You didn't know they were on the move.

09:59.348 --> 10:01.646
You wouldn't be spread so thin
if you'd known.

10:01.717 --> 10:03.480
How do you know we're spread out?

10:03.986 --> 10:08.218
Listen, General. I'm good at this business.

10:10.026 --> 10:13.689
Sir, I beg your pardon,
but if this man's story is true...

10:14.363 --> 10:16.228
...why haven't we heard about it?

10:16.299 --> 10:19.735
General Stuart's cavalry is out there.
He would have reported.

10:21.404 --> 10:24.703
- What do you know about Jeb Stuart?
- He's out there all right.

10:24.940 --> 10:28.000
He's riding up north somewhere
getting his name in the papers.

10:28.077 --> 10:30.307
He hasn't caused anything but a little fuss.

10:30.446 --> 10:34.109
If the federal army was moving that fast,
as close as you say...

10:34.517 --> 10:37.145
...I have to believe General Stuart...
- Now, look here.

10:37.219 --> 10:40.313
I came within an angry mule's kick
of the whole Yankee cavalry.

10:41.123 --> 10:43.751
And all the way through a picket line.

10:44.360 --> 10:45.884
Hazardous, too.

10:48.364 --> 10:50.457
I don't know what Jeb Stuart's doing.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.496
I don't care. I do my job.

10:52.601 --> 10:55.069
Yankee cavalry's down the road,
thick as fleas...

10:55.137 --> 10:57.605
...not two hours hard ride
from this here now spot.

10:57.673 --> 11:00.039
And that, by God, is the Lord's truth!

11:07.983 --> 11:09.678
- Major Sorrel.
- Yes, sir.

11:11.420 --> 11:15.481
Will you go to General Lee's headquarters
and notify him about this?

11:16.492 --> 11:17.754
Yes, sir.

11:19.595 --> 11:21.119
- Captain Goree.
- Yes, sir.

11:21.464 --> 11:23.091
Get this man a tent.

11:24.166 --> 11:26.031
And a cigar.

11:26.736 --> 11:27.794
Sir.

11:28.971 --> 11:32.304
He says the lead element is here
with the Third Corps...

11:32.641 --> 11:34.541
...the Sixth right behind...

11:34.610 --> 11:37.238
...supported by a column of federal cavalry.

11:37.713 --> 11:39.442
Seven corps all together.

11:40.816 --> 11:44.582
The First and Eleventh
are above Taneytown.

11:45.721 --> 11:47.985
And there's more cavalry two hours east.

11:48.324 --> 11:50.918
There may be as many
as 100,000 all together.

11:52.428 --> 11:54.896
Do you believe the man, this Mr. Harrison?

11:56.265 --> 12:00.395
No choice. You remember him, sir,
the actor from Mississippi?

12:00.736 --> 12:03.796
An actor?
We move on the word of an actor?

12:04.707 --> 12:06.004
Can't afford not to.

12:16.152 --> 12:19.053
There would be some word
from General Stuart.

12:22.658 --> 12:25.092
General Stuart would not leave us blind.

12:28.364 --> 12:31.265
One other thing. Hooker's been replaced.

12:31.434 --> 12:34.892
George Meade's the new commander.
Harrison read it in the Yankee papers.

12:35.404 --> 12:38.567
George Meade, Pennsylvania man.

12:39.975 --> 12:42.000
Meade would be cautious, I think.

12:42.077 --> 12:44.272
Take him some time to get organized.

12:45.247 --> 12:47.215
Perhaps we should move more swiftly.

12:47.783 --> 12:49.648
There may be an opportunity here.

12:49.718 --> 12:50.776
Yes, sir.

12:52.688 --> 12:54.121
No reason to delay.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.187
I think we should concentrate here.

12:59.695 --> 13:02.425
All the roads converge
just east of this gap.

13:02.498 --> 13:05.058
- This junction will be very necessary.
- Yes, sir.

13:05.134 --> 13:08.160
I left my spectacles over there.
What is the name of this town?

13:11.307 --> 13:12.535
Gettysburg.

13:12.608 --> 13:13.939
Very well.

13:18.147 --> 13:19.910
Message for Colonel Chamberlain.

13:53.048 --> 13:55.642
Colonel, darling. Rise up, me bucko.

13:57.419 --> 14:00.081
I'm sorry, darling,
but we got a bit of a problem here.

14:00.155 --> 14:02.020
Would you like to hear about it?

14:02.124 --> 14:04.024
Would you wake up, sir?

14:04.527 --> 14:06.586
We got a whole company coming, sir.

14:06.795 --> 14:10.390
This way. I'll give you time to wake up,
but we've got quite a problem.

14:11.133 --> 14:14.899
All together 120 men are coming.
We're to be having them as guests.

14:16.672 --> 14:17.764
What?

14:18.107 --> 14:19.597
Should be here any minute.

14:20.209 --> 14:22.370
- Who?
- Mutineers.

14:23.345 --> 14:25.370
Mutineers, Colonel, me lad.

14:25.481 --> 14:28.917
120 men from the old Second Maine
which has been disbanded.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.387
120 mutineers?

14:34.089 --> 14:35.351
Yes, sir.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.650
You see, what happened was
the enlistment papers...

14:38.727 --> 14:40.558
...on the old Second Maine run out.

14:40.629 --> 14:43.325
They were sent home,
all except these 120 fellows...

14:43.399 --> 14:45.765
...who foolishly signed three-year papers.

14:45.834 --> 14:47.165
Three years, that is.

14:47.503 --> 14:49.937
So these poor fellows
got one more year to serve.

14:50.005 --> 14:53.600
Only they thought they were signing
to fight only with the Second Maine...

14:53.676 --> 14:55.268
...and the Second Maine only.

14:55.344 --> 14:56.606
So they...

14:57.680 --> 14:58.669
...quit.

14:59.248 --> 15:02.012
They resigned, you see. 120 men.

15:04.086 --> 15:06.611
- Colonel, are you all right?
- Yeah.

15:07.389 --> 15:10.654
The point is,
these Maine fellows won't fight no more.

15:10.726 --> 15:13.820
Nobody can send them home
and nobody knows what to do with them.

15:13.896 --> 15:15.386
Until they thought of us...

15:15.497 --> 15:18.728
...being as we are the only other
Maine regiment in the Fifth Corps.

15:18.834 --> 15:21.132
So they've been assigned to us.

15:21.971 --> 15:23.029
Yes, sir.

15:23.105 --> 15:26.165
I have a message here
from the new commanding general.

15:26.842 --> 15:28.139
George Meade, sir.

15:28.210 --> 15:29.199
That's right.

15:29.278 --> 15:31.576
Our very own general
of our very own corps...

15:31.680 --> 15:34.308
...has been promoted
to command of the whole army.

15:34.383 --> 15:36.908
The latest, if you keep track of them
as they go by.

15:37.987 --> 15:42.219
The message says they'll be arriving
this morning and they are to join us.

15:43.225 --> 15:47.093
"And if they refuse to follow orders,
please feel free to shoot them."

15:47.596 --> 15:49.223
- To shoot them?
- Yes, sir.

15:52.067 --> 15:53.932
These Maine men?

16:00.476 --> 16:04.674
"You are hereby authorized to shoot
any man who refuses to do his duty."

16:07.449 --> 16:09.076
Are these all Maine men?

16:09.151 --> 16:12.052
Yes, sir. And fine big fellows they are, too.

16:15.090 --> 16:17.558
Mutiny. I thought that was
a word for the Navy.

16:22.665 --> 16:24.530
We'll move at sunrise.

16:27.269 --> 16:29.134
It's a good time of the day.

16:29.605 --> 16:32.438
I always do enjoy this time,
just before the dawn.

16:34.610 --> 16:37.408
When all this is over,
I shall miss it very much.

16:38.714 --> 16:39.772
Sir?

16:40.716 --> 16:42.513
I didn't mean the fighting.

16:46.989 --> 16:48.820
It's all in God's hands now.

16:50.659 --> 16:51.648
Good day, sir.

16:52.394 --> 16:53.588
Good day to you.

17:05.674 --> 17:06.902
General, sir.

17:07.675 --> 17:11.737
Should I wake them up, sir?
Should I get them waked up and get going?

17:11.814 --> 17:13.179
No, Moxely.

17:13.715 --> 17:16.445
Let the boys sleep a little longer.
They'll need it.

17:16.518 --> 17:17.780
Yes, sir.

17:44.680 --> 17:47.148
Prisoners, mark file, left!

17:47.416 --> 17:50.943
How many men do we have now
in the 20th Maine?

17:51.019 --> 17:54.182
Somewhere around 250, sir,
counting the officers.

17:54.790 --> 17:58.089
How the heck are we supposed
to take care of 120 men?

17:59.428 --> 18:01.828
Colonel, it's going to be a hot day today.

18:02.397 --> 18:06.356
Seeing as you already been down
with the heat, will you ride the horse...

18:06.435 --> 18:10.929
...that the good Lord provided,
instead of marching in the dirty dust?

18:11.240 --> 18:12.605
You walked.

18:12.841 --> 18:15.969
Darling, I've been in the infantry
since you was in books.

18:16.044 --> 18:19.673
After the first few thousand miles,
a man gets limber with his feet.

18:19.815 --> 18:21.305
'Morning, Lawrence.

18:22.484 --> 18:24.782
How are you?
You're looking kind of peaked.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.821
Darn it, Tom. Don't call me Lawrence.

18:28.690 --> 18:30.282
It doesn't make sense.

18:30.425 --> 18:32.825
Hold a gun on a man to get him to fight.

18:40.469 --> 18:42.733
Detail, about face.

18:45.574 --> 18:47.007
Attention, detail!

18:47.576 --> 18:50.204
You heard the Captain. Pay attention!

18:50.813 --> 18:53.338
Guards, get these men back on their feet!

19:03.192 --> 19:05.660
I'm looking for commanding officer,
20th Maine.

19:05.727 --> 19:06.716
You found him.

19:06.795 --> 19:08.956
- That's him, all right.
- You're Chamberlain?

19:09.832 --> 19:11.663
Colonel Chamberlain to you.

19:13.802 --> 19:15.292
Captain Brewer, sir.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.266
118th Pennsylvania.

19:18.507 --> 19:21.943
If you're the commanding officer,
I present you with these prisoners.

19:22.110 --> 19:23.475
You're welcome to them.

19:23.545 --> 19:26.378
Lord knows, I had to use the bayonet
to keep them moving.

19:28.483 --> 19:30.508
You have to sign for them.

19:32.020 --> 19:33.783
Sign it, Lieutenant.

19:44.266 --> 19:45.824
You are relieved, Captain.

19:47.636 --> 19:50.571
You are authorized to use
whatever force necessary.

19:51.173 --> 19:52.663
You want to shoot them...

19:53.642 --> 19:55.166
...go right ahead.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.340
Won't nobody say nothing.

20:02.885 --> 20:05.046
I said, you are relieved, Captain.

20:17.733 --> 20:20.361
You men can leave now.
We won't be needing any guards.

20:28.076 --> 20:31.341
My name is Chamberlain.
I'm the Colonel of the 20th Maine.

20:34.449 --> 20:36.917
When did you have something to eat?

20:38.620 --> 20:41.145
They tried to break us by not feeding us.

20:42.457 --> 20:43.617
We ain't broke yet.

20:44.026 --> 20:46.995
They just told me you were coming
a little while ago.

20:47.396 --> 20:48.829
I'll get the cook going.

20:48.931 --> 20:51.365
The meat may be raw,
but there's no time to cook.

20:51.433 --> 20:55.096
We've got quite a ways to go today.
You'll be coming with us, so eat hearty.

20:55.337 --> 20:58.272
We'll set you up in those trees.
Sergeant Tozier, see to it.

20:58.373 --> 20:59.635
Yes, sir.

21:04.079 --> 21:07.515
You boys go eat, then I'll come over
and hear what you have to say.

21:14.656 --> 21:16.317
Colonel, we've got grievances.

21:19.995 --> 21:22.225
The men elected me to talk for them.

21:23.165 --> 21:25.725
All right. You come along with me.

21:26.501 --> 21:29.959
The rest of you boys go eat.
We're going to get moving in a little bit.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.707
All right, men, on your feet.

21:39.848 --> 21:42.544
- Gosh, Lawrence.
- Smile. Don't call me Lawrence.

21:42.617 --> 21:44.414
- Are they moving?
- Yes, sir.

21:45.287 --> 21:47.187
Forward, march.

21:47.255 --> 21:48.882
What's your name?

21:50.092 --> 21:52.185
I don't feel too kindly, Colonel.

21:53.462 --> 21:55.896
Yes, well, I'm usually not this informal.

21:55.964 --> 21:59.593
I just took command
of this regiment a few days ago.

21:59.701 --> 22:02.966
Somebody ought to welcome you
to my... our outfit.

22:04.106 --> 22:08.372
They tell me they're holding you fellows
because you signed three-year papers.

22:08.510 --> 22:10.876
I'm sorry. Would you like some coffee?

22:11.480 --> 22:12.742
Are you sure?

22:15.550 --> 22:18.018
- Go ahead. Sit down, Mister <i>... </i>
- Bucklin.

22:18.854 --> 22:20.378
Joseph Bucklin.

22:21.957 --> 22:25.586
Listen, Colonel.
I've been in 11 different engagements.

22:26.161 --> 22:27.890
How many have you been in?

22:30.532 --> 22:31.829
Not that many.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.729
It ain't the papers.

22:34.169 --> 22:37.138
I've done my share. We all have.

22:37.773 --> 22:40.765
They are damn good men.
Shouldn't be used this way.

22:43.612 --> 22:44.943
Look here.

22:46.681 --> 22:48.342
It went clean through.

22:50.318 --> 22:51.808
We got a courier coming.

22:54.489 --> 22:57.617
Listen, Colonel. I'm tired.

22:58.727 --> 23:00.922
You know what I mean? I'm tired.

23:01.063 --> 23:05.727
I've had all this army, all these officers <i>... </i>
This damn Hooker, this damn idiot Meade.

23:05.901 --> 23:10.338
All of them. The whole bloody, lousy mess
of sick-brained, potbellied scareheads.

23:10.439 --> 23:12.737
They ain't fit to lead a johnny detail.

23:12.808 --> 23:16.710
They ain't fit to pour pee out of a boot
with instructions written under the heel.

23:18.513 --> 23:19.844
I'm tired.

23:20.549 --> 23:22.983
We're good men
and we had our own good flag.

23:24.219 --> 23:27.677
These damn idiots used us
like we were cows or dogs or worse.

23:28.256 --> 23:29.814
We aren't gonna win this war.

23:29.891 --> 23:32.883
We can't win with these
lame-brained bastards from West Point.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.986
These damn gentlemen! These officers!

23:37.966 --> 23:39.593
The courier, sir.

23:43.572 --> 23:45.062
Don't go away.

23:47.609 --> 23:49.042
Colonel Chamberlain, sir.

23:49.111 --> 23:52.376
Colonel Vincent wishes to inform you
the Fifth Corps is moving out.

23:52.481 --> 23:55.279
You and the 20th Maine Regiment
are instructed to lead.

23:55.350 --> 23:59.446
20th Maine's assigned first position in line.
Send out advanced guards and flankers.

23:59.521 --> 24:01.318
- Flankers?
- Yes, Flankers.

24:02.057 --> 24:04.617
Right, yes.
My compliments to the Colonel.

24:05.427 --> 24:07.987
Captain Clark, you heard him.
Get the regiment up.

24:08.096 --> 24:10.155
Sound the assembly. Strike the tents.

24:12.200 --> 24:15.431
You better get something to eat.
Looks like you could use it.

24:15.504 --> 24:17.301
Tell your men I'm coming.

24:17.372 --> 24:20.034
The boys from the Second Maine
are being fed, Lawrence.

24:20.108 --> 24:21.769
Don't call me Lawrence.

24:22.511 --> 24:24.570
Damn it, Lawrence. I'm your brother.

24:24.646 --> 24:27.274
Be careful about the name business
in front of the men.

24:27.349 --> 24:29.647
Because we're brothers,
it looks like favoritism.

24:29.718 --> 24:32.209
General Meade got his own son
as his aide-de-camp.

24:32.354 --> 24:35.050
That's different. Generals can do anything.

24:35.357 --> 24:38.485
Nothing quite like God on earth
as a general on battlefield.

24:39.928 --> 24:43.261
What are you going to do with them?
Colonel, sir.

24:43.865 --> 24:46.698
You can't shoot them.
You never go back to Maine if you do.

24:46.768 --> 24:48.167
I know that.

24:49.604 --> 24:51.299
I wonder if they do.

24:56.678 --> 24:59.146
Colonel, sir. You know who this man is?

24:59.214 --> 25:01.842
Dan Burns, from Orono.
I know his daddy, the preacher.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.475
Best cusser I ever heard.

25:03.552 --> 25:06.419
Knows more fine swear words
than any man in Maine.

25:25.740 --> 25:27.435
You men gather around.

25:40.522 --> 25:44.549
I've been talking with Private Bucklin.
He's told me about your problem.

25:46.161 --> 25:48.061
There's nothing I can do today.

25:48.129 --> 25:51.030
We're moving out in a few minutes.
We'll be moving all day.

25:51.132 --> 25:53.930
I've been ordered
to take you men with me.

25:54.302 --> 25:55.860
I'm told that...

25:58.073 --> 26:00.041
...if you don't come, I can shoot you.

26:02.010 --> 26:04.342
Well, you know I won't do that.

26:04.846 --> 26:07.212
Maybe somebody else will, but I won't.

26:07.515 --> 26:09.107
So, that's that.

26:09.551 --> 26:11.746
Here's the situation.

26:12.687 --> 26:16.589
The whole reb army is up that road
a ways waiting for us.

26:16.658 --> 26:18.455
This is no time for an argument.

26:18.526 --> 26:20.790
I tell you, we could surely use you fellows.

26:20.895 --> 26:23.159
We're now well below half strength.

26:23.231 --> 26:26.723
Whether you fight or not, that's up to you.

26:27.035 --> 26:30.698
Whether you come along is <i>... </i>
Well, you're coming.

26:32.007 --> 26:33.634
You know who we are.

26:33.742 --> 26:36.768
If you fight alongside us,
there's a few things you must know.

26:37.178 --> 26:40.579
This regiment was formed
last summer in Maine.

26:42.350 --> 26:44.443
There were 1,000 of us then.

26:44.953 --> 26:47.387
There are less than 300 of us now.

26:52.093 --> 26:55.494
All of us volunteered to fight for the Union,
just as you did.

26:57.465 --> 27:00.525
Some came mainly because
we were bored at home.

27:01.670 --> 27:04.138
Thought this looked like it might be fun.

27:05.607 --> 27:08.007
Some came because
we were ashamed not to.

27:10.478 --> 27:14.676
Many of us came
because it was the right thing to do.

27:18.520 --> 27:20.545
And all of us have seen men die.

27:22.957 --> 27:25.050
This is a different kind of army.

27:25.126 --> 27:28.425
If you look back through history,
you'll see men fighting for pay...

27:28.496 --> 27:31.124
...for women, for some other kind of loot.

27:31.199 --> 27:33.429
They fight for land, power.

27:35.804 --> 27:38.864
Because a king leads them,
or just because they like killing.

27:40.442 --> 27:42.376
We are here for something new.

27:42.844 --> 27:46.302
This has not happened much
in the history of the world.

27:48.550 --> 27:51.542
We are an army out to set other men free.

27:54.022 --> 27:56.684
America should be free ground.

27:58.326 --> 27:59.418
All of it.

27:59.861 --> 28:02.887
Not divided by a line
between slave state and free.

28:02.964 --> 28:06.923
All the way from here to the Pacific Ocean.

28:10.038 --> 28:11.699
No man has to bow.

28:13.308 --> 28:15.367
No man born to royalty.

28:15.477 --> 28:19.277
Here we judge you by what you do,
not by who your father was.

28:21.549 --> 28:23.312
Here you can be something.

28:24.285 --> 28:27.049
Here is the place to build a home.

28:29.991 --> 28:31.856
But it's not the land.

28:33.228 --> 28:35.219
There's always more land.

28:37.899 --> 28:41.426
It's the idea that we all have value.

28:44.105 --> 28:45.470
You and me.

28:49.878 --> 28:54.008
What we're fighting for, in the end...

28:58.153 --> 29:00.246
...we're fighting for each other.

29:13.334 --> 29:14.323
Sorry.

29:15.670 --> 29:17.399
I didn't mean to preach.

29:20.175 --> 29:21.437
You go ahead.

29:22.577 --> 29:23.874
You talk for a while.

29:27.348 --> 29:31.307
If you choose to join us and want
your muskets back, you can have them.

29:31.953 --> 29:34.581
Nothing more will be said
by anybody, anywhere.

29:35.457 --> 29:39.450
If you choose not to join us,
you can come along under guard.

29:39.527 --> 29:41.586
When this is over, I'll do what I can...

29:41.663 --> 29:44.826
...to see you get a fair treatment,
but for now, we're moving out.

29:51.139 --> 29:52.538
Gentlemen.

29:53.975 --> 29:56.205
I think if we lose this fight...

29:58.413 --> 30:00.142
...we lose the war.

30:02.383 --> 30:06.752
So, if you choose to join us,
I'll be personally very grateful.

30:31.279 --> 30:33.213
Colonel, it's a fine morning.

30:33.281 --> 30:35.772
- Captain Spear, are we ready?
- Sir, that we are.

30:35.850 --> 30:37.681
Then, let's move out.

30:37.952 --> 30:39.613
20th Maine!

30:40.421 --> 30:41.410
Forward!

30:43.191 --> 30:44.180
March!

32:46.848 --> 32:48.338
That's infantry, all right.

32:49.183 --> 32:50.912
At least a whole brigade.

32:52.286 --> 32:53.548
Any sign of cavalry?

32:54.322 --> 32:55.687
Not a lick, sir.

32:56.124 --> 32:57.648
That's strange.

32:58.059 --> 33:00.425
Infantry moving alone
in enemy country, blind.

33:00.528 --> 33:01.961
Very strange, sir.

33:03.131 --> 33:04.564
What do you make of that?

33:05.199 --> 33:06.791
He's headed this way.

33:06.868 --> 33:07.926
Sir?

33:08.469 --> 33:10.460
Lee's turned. That's the main body.

33:10.538 --> 33:11.869
You think so?

33:12.840 --> 33:16.003
- I thought they were headed for Harrisburg.
- He was.

33:16.277 --> 33:18.837
That's too many troops
to be a raiding party.

33:19.714 --> 33:21.113
There's power behind it.

33:21.416 --> 33:25.113
Sir, if you want to fight here,
this is such lovely ground.

33:25.887 --> 33:28.117
It's the best damn ground I've seen all day.

33:28.189 --> 33:29.554
It is that.

33:34.862 --> 33:37.057
We'll move both brigades into town.

33:37.498 --> 33:39.796
That'll make the good citizens happy.

33:41.736 --> 33:43.328
Let's go down and have a look.

34:30.083 --> 34:34.020
- Soldier, your shirt needs mending.
- I thought the war was in Virginia.

34:36.424 --> 34:38.152
What division are you boys with?

34:48.069 --> 34:49.696
Colonel, do you mind?

34:50.036 --> 34:53.473
A good officer doesn't ride all day.
I've been sitting too long anyway.

34:53.674 --> 34:55.301
What do you think?

34:55.376 --> 34:58.004
- What do you think?
- About what?

34:58.079 --> 35:00.274
About the Second Maine boys, what else?

35:00.348 --> 35:02.145
Are any of them going to join us?

35:02.250 --> 35:04.377
Would you believe it? All but six!

35:04.886 --> 35:05.614
What?

35:05.853 --> 35:08.879
I counted by actual vote.
114 voted to pick up the rifle.

35:09.323 --> 35:12.053
- Well, I'll be.
- You did good, brother, real good!

35:12.126 --> 35:14.287
Good. See to it they don't march together.

35:14.362 --> 35:17.160
Yes. Glazier's got the hard heads in tow.
There are six.

35:17.231 --> 35:19.597
Get the names.
Put them in different companies.

35:19.667 --> 35:21.931
I want them spread out,
not bunched together.

35:22.003 --> 35:24.801
- I'll see about their muskets.
- Colonel, sir.

36:40.348 --> 36:42.680
You know what's happening here
in the morning?

36:42.783 --> 36:43.841
Sir?

36:43.918 --> 36:46.409
The whole damn rebel army
is gonna be here.

36:47.321 --> 36:50.552
They'll move through this town,
occupy the hills on the other side.

36:50.625 --> 36:54.925
When our people arrive, Lee'll have
high ground. There'll be the devil to pay.

36:54.996 --> 36:56.588
The high ground!

36:58.766 --> 37:03.465
Meade will come in slowly, cautiously,
new to command.

37:04.972 --> 37:07.372
They'll be on his back from Washington.

37:08.009 --> 37:11.103
Wires hot with messages. Attack! Attack!

37:13.547 --> 37:16.175
So he will set up a ring around these hills.

37:17.885 --> 37:22.413
And when Lee's army is nicely entrenched
behind fat rocks on the high ground...

37:22.490 --> 37:25.357
...Meade will finally attack,
if he can coordinate the army.

37:25.993 --> 37:28.723
Straight up the hillside, out in the open...

37:29.397 --> 37:31.592
...in that gorgeous field of fire.

37:33.567 --> 37:38.527
We will charge valiantly
and be butchered valiantly.

37:43.477 --> 37:47.504
And afterward, men in tall hats and
gold watch fobs will thump their chest...

37:47.581 --> 37:50.072
...and say what a brave charge it was.

37:58.960 --> 38:00.825
Devin, I've led a soldier's life...

38:02.129 --> 38:05.394
...and I've never seen anything
as brutally clear as this.

38:05.933 --> 38:10.267
It's as if I can actually see the blue troops
in one long bloody moment...

38:11.105 --> 38:13.699
...going up the long slope
to the stony top...

38:15.409 --> 38:17.434
...as if it were already done...

38:18.245 --> 38:20.042
...and already a memory.

38:20.648 --> 38:22.616
An odd, set...

38:24.085 --> 38:25.985
...stony quality to it.

38:27.855 --> 38:31.951
As if tomorrow has already happened
and there's nothing you can do about it.

38:33.060 --> 38:35.995
The way you sometimes feel
before an ill-considered attack...

38:36.097 --> 38:38.065
...knowing it will fail...

38:38.232 --> 38:40.097
...but you cannot stop it.

38:41.235 --> 38:43.965
You must even take part and help it fail.

38:49.410 --> 38:51.071
We have 2,500 men.

38:52.146 --> 38:54.239
They'll be coming in force.

38:55.416 --> 38:59.113
There could be 20,000
coming down that road in the morning.

39:02.823 --> 39:06.486
If we hold this ridge for a couple of hours,
we can keep them away.

39:06.560 --> 39:09.120
We can block that road
until our main body gets here.

39:09.563 --> 39:12.123
We can deprive the enemy
of the high ground!

39:12.767 --> 39:15.759
The boys are ready for a brawl.
No doubt of that.

39:15.836 --> 39:17.895
We'll force the reb to deploy.

39:18.472 --> 39:20.838
That's a narrow road
they'll be coming down.

39:21.275 --> 39:25.735
If we stack them up, it will take them
a while to get on track to get into position.

39:26.514 --> 39:27.913
Is Calef's battery up yet?

39:28.582 --> 39:30.607
His six guns are deploying now.

39:30.785 --> 39:33.049
How far back is Reynolds
with the main force?

39:33.554 --> 39:35.681
About 10 miles, sir. Not much more.

39:46.467 --> 39:48.867
Sir, you were right.

39:49.737 --> 39:52.729
My scouts report the rebel army
is coming this way, for sure.

39:52.840 --> 39:55.434
They're all concentrating in this direction.

40:04.985 --> 40:07.385
We'll hold here in the morning.

40:08.155 --> 40:11.090
Long enough for Reynolds
and the infantry to arrive.

40:11.792 --> 40:14.317
If we hang onto the high ground,
we have a chance...

40:14.395 --> 40:16.386
...to win this fight that's coming.

40:16.931 --> 40:19.195
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

40:19.834 --> 40:23.292
Post the cannon along this road,
the Chambersburg Pike.

40:24.004 --> 40:28.168
The rebels will hit us at dawn.
I think we can hold them at least 2 hours.

40:28.242 --> 40:31.006
Hell, General,
we can hold them all the livelong day.

40:31.078 --> 40:32.375
He's right, sir.

40:32.580 --> 40:35.014
At Thoroughfare Gap,
you held against Longstreet.

40:35.082 --> 40:38.279
- You held for six hours.
- They never came. We held for nothing.

40:45.693 --> 40:48.560
The rebs should come in
just about first light.

40:49.163 --> 40:50.790
Keep a clear eye.

40:51.866 --> 40:54.334
Have the pickets give us a good warning.

40:54.635 --> 40:56.000
All right, gentlemen.

40:56.570 --> 40:58.162
Let's get posted.

41:32.640 --> 41:35.837
<i>General Reynolds, </i>
<i>my troops are deployed on good ground... </i>

41:35.943 --> 41:38.844
<i>... west of Gettysburg</i>
<i>on the Chambersburg Pike. </i>

41:41.815 --> 41:44.443
<i>I've sent reconnaissance parties</i>
<i>in every direction... </i>

41:44.552 --> 41:47.112
<i>... from which the enemy</i>
<i>might be approaching. </i>

41:47.188 --> 41:50.487
<i>I'm satisfied A.P. Hill's corps</i>
<i>is massed just west of here... </i>

41:50.558 --> 41:52.185
<i>... back of Cashtown. </i>

41:52.493 --> 41:55.656
<i>The enemy's pickets</i>
<i>are within four miles of my position. </i>

41:56.363 --> 41:59.628
<i>Rumor says Ewell's</i>
<i>coming over the mountains from Carlisle. </i>

42:04.838 --> 42:08.330
<i>If true, two Confederate corps</i>
<i>will converge upon us in the morning. </i>

42:08.475 --> 42:10.841
<i>One from the west and one from the north. </i>

42:10.945 --> 42:13.743
<i>Do you want me to hold</i>
<i>this position if attacked? </i>

42:14.181 --> 42:16.081
<i>Confirmation requested. </i>

42:17.418 --> 42:18.817
<i>J.N.O. Buford. </i>

42:42.076 --> 42:44.340
<i>"Blow down thy heaven, O Lord. </i>

42:45.079 --> 42:48.845
<i>"Come down and touch the mountains</i>
<i>and they shall smoke. </i>

42:50.184 --> 42:55.349
<i>"Blessed be the Lord, my strength, </i>
<i>which teaches my fingers to fight... </i>

42:56.123 --> 42:59.251
<i>"...and my hands to war. Amen. "</i>

43:01.795 --> 43:03.524
Good morning, Lucy.

43:05.132 --> 43:07.293
Traveler, good morning to you, sir.

43:11.005 --> 43:12.097
Good morning, sir.

43:12.506 --> 43:13.973
Good morning, Major Taylor.

43:14.041 --> 43:16.669
- Will the General have some breakfast?
- No, thank you.

43:16.744 --> 43:18.837
We have flapjacks in small mountains.

43:18.912 --> 43:22.439
Fresh butter, bacon, wagons of ham,
apple butter, ripe cherries.

43:22.783 --> 43:24.580
You really ought to pitch in, sir.

43:24.652 --> 43:27.621
Courtesy of our host,
the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

43:40.267 --> 43:41.598
Good morning, sir.

43:42.036 --> 43:43.901
General Longstreet, good morning.

43:48.309 --> 43:50.072
Federal forces are concentrating.

43:50.144 --> 43:53.409
Yes, and I've confirmed
some of your man Harrison's information.

43:53.480 --> 43:56.074
Their new commander
is definitely George Meade.

43:59.353 --> 44:01.617
I have reports of Union cavalry
in Gettysburg.

44:02.389 --> 44:03.617
Cavalry?

44:03.991 --> 44:05.925
General Hill reports only militia.

44:06.660 --> 44:07.524
He did?

44:09.296 --> 44:10.695
Well, it's cavalry.

44:10.764 --> 44:13.460
Where there's cavalry,
infantry will be close behind.

44:13.634 --> 44:14.862
Meade's closing fast.

44:14.935 --> 44:17.563
It could be he's thinking
of swinging round behind us.

44:17.638 --> 44:21.699
Behind, in front: direction does not matter.
We'll fight him wherever he is.

44:21.775 --> 44:25.677
Probably got old Abe Lincoln on his back
frantic to throw us out of Pennsylvania.

44:25.746 --> 44:27.475
We may have an opportunity here.

44:28.315 --> 44:29.407
I agree.

44:30.217 --> 44:33.744
Our objective was to get their army
out of Virginia and into the open.

44:33.887 --> 44:35.616
Now they are in the open.

44:35.956 --> 44:38.083
General Meade has been forcing the march.

44:38.525 --> 44:40.356
The weather has been unusually hot.

44:40.427 --> 44:44.193
He will probably arrive here worn out
and weary, piece by piece.

44:44.598 --> 44:47.396
If we concentrate,
we can hit him as he comes up.

44:47.601 --> 44:50.502
If we can take out a few of his corps,
we can even the odds.

44:50.571 --> 44:53.540
But we must strike hard
and we must strike quickly.

44:54.975 --> 44:56.567
What artillery is that, Major?

44:57.010 --> 44:58.375
I don't know, sir.

44:58.579 --> 45:00.240
General Heth is in front.

45:00.314 --> 45:03.681
- My instructions were clear?
- Yes, sir. To all commanders.

45:03.751 --> 45:06.914
Avoid contact with the enemy
until the army's up and concentrated.

45:06.987 --> 45:08.113
And General Heth?

45:08.188 --> 45:10.452
He has instructions
not to force major action.

45:10.524 --> 45:11.923
I told him this morning.

45:11.992 --> 45:14.825
We should move closer to the front.
Send for General Heth.

45:14.895 --> 45:17.227
- I must know what is going on.
- Yes, sir.

45:18.732 --> 45:19.630
General...

45:21.402 --> 45:25.168
...in the fight that is coming,
I want you to stay back from the main line.

45:25.239 --> 45:28.208
This army has lost too many
of its veteran commanders...

45:28.275 --> 45:31.904
...and you, sir, have a very bad habit
of moving too far forward.

45:35.315 --> 45:36.714
Can't lead from behind.

45:37.050 --> 45:38.608
May I say it plainly, sir.

45:39.153 --> 45:40.780
I cannot afford to lose you.

45:42.389 --> 45:46.052
Now, General, let's look to this day.
You may bring up your corps.

45:52.866 --> 45:55.892
Major Taylor, have Traveler saddled up.

45:56.770 --> 45:59.364
- I'm going to look around for myself.
- Yes, sir.

47:14.781 --> 47:17.272
They've got a brigade in position
and that's all.

47:17.985 --> 47:22.012
We've got the best damn ground around,
and they're hitting me with one brigade.

47:23.023 --> 47:24.718
Lovely.

47:36.670 --> 47:38.399
Go on down, gentlemen.

47:55.155 --> 47:56.349
Fall back!

48:01.495 --> 48:02.962
They are on the run.

48:13.840 --> 48:15.034
Close crop, General.

48:15.108 --> 48:17.303
- How are your losses?
- Not bad at all, sir.

48:17.644 --> 48:20.272
We got them out in the open.
Really got a twist on them.

48:20.347 --> 48:23.214
They are arrogant people, you know?
They came right at us.

48:23.951 --> 48:27.478
We took some prisoners.
They're from Heth's division of Hill's corps.

48:27.554 --> 48:29.488
That's what I've got in front of me.

48:29.556 --> 48:32.684
A new division. 8,000 men more or less.
All within sound of this.

48:32.759 --> 48:36.456
Just back up that road between here
and Cashtown. A little ways up the road.

48:36.597 --> 48:38.929
It'll take them a little while to get on line.

48:38.999 --> 48:42.400
Yes, sir, but Hill's whole corps is behind.
Maybe 25,000.

48:42.469 --> 48:45.165
Longstreet behind that.
Ewell over there to the north.

48:45.238 --> 48:46.569
I know, Colonel.

48:46.640 --> 48:50.508
When John Reynolds gets here,
he won't have the full army with him.

48:50.577 --> 48:51.703
Only part of it.

48:51.778 --> 48:54.679
The point is, the rebs will be here
this afternoon...

48:54.748 --> 48:57.774
...with everything they've got.
I just thought I'd mention it.

48:58.685 --> 49:00.983
Now, what do you want me to do here, sir?

49:01.655 --> 49:03.247
Heth will be back in a bit.

49:03.690 --> 49:06.386
If he's got any brains at all,
and he's not stupid...

49:06.526 --> 49:09.654
...he'll know by now he's got at least
a brigade in front of him.

49:09.730 --> 49:11.994
He won't wait
to get his whole division in line.

49:12.065 --> 49:13.828
That would take half the morning.

49:13.900 --> 49:15.663
He don't need his whole division.

49:17.804 --> 49:18.964
That's right.

49:19.406 --> 49:22.432
Does Devin report any activity on his front
over to the right?

49:22.743 --> 49:24.836
- No, sir. Not a lick.
- All right.

49:25.345 --> 49:28.109
I'll have Devin leave his cover
and withdraw his boys...

49:28.181 --> 49:31.241
...and have them move in alongside you,
lengthening your line.

49:32.352 --> 49:35.014
When Heth gets back,
he'll run into two brigades.

49:35.522 --> 49:37.888
That ought to hold him
until Reynolds gets here.

49:38.158 --> 49:39.056
Right, sir.

49:43.330 --> 49:46.857
Damn sure glad the rain is gone.
Don't want anything to slow up Reynolds.

49:52.305 --> 49:53.966
Take care of yourself, Colonel.

49:54.941 --> 49:57.432
Don't worry about me, sir.
I'm the soul of caution.

50:52.032 --> 50:53.021
Fire!

50:56.570 --> 50:58.561
Move! Fall back!

51:44.751 --> 51:47.015
That flank <i>... </i> Hold it!

51:54.327 --> 51:55.624
Keep up your fire!

52:06.173 --> 52:07.470
Gamble's down, sir.

52:07.574 --> 52:09.940
Colonel Gamble, but he's not hurt bad, sir.

52:17.450 --> 52:18.815
I'm all right.

52:21.388 --> 52:22.912
It was close, that's all.

52:32.766 --> 52:35.826
Sir, Colonel Devin's compliments.
No problem on the right.

52:35.936 --> 52:38.598
They came up close,
but we put in the reserve.

52:38.672 --> 52:40.299
We didn't put it all in, sir.

52:40.373 --> 52:42.534
Wishes to know if you have further orders.

52:42.609 --> 52:44.873
Tell Devin all reserve forward, now.

52:55.956 --> 52:57.116
Keep up your fire!

53:00.527 --> 53:01.516
Fire!

53:03.763 --> 53:04.627
Fire!

54:00.954 --> 54:02.512
Sir, it's General Reynolds.

54:16.736 --> 54:17.725
Thank God.

54:27.480 --> 54:28.606
What goes, John?

54:29.015 --> 54:30.607
There's the devil to pay!

54:30.917 --> 54:33.181
- Can you hold?
- I reckon I can.

54:43.330 --> 54:47.858
Heth probably has about 10,000 men
coming down that road, wouldn't you say?

54:47.934 --> 54:50.095
Yes, sir. But there'll be more behind him.

54:50.170 --> 54:53.833
We can put almost 20,000 in the field.
We're in very good shape, I think.

54:54.374 --> 54:55.500
For a while, sir.

54:56.042 --> 54:59.978
I'm sending messages to all commanders
to come here with all possible speed.

55:05.618 --> 55:06.880
It's lovely ground.

55:09.089 --> 55:10.750
I thought so, sir.

55:13.059 --> 55:15.186
Now let's go surprise Harry Heth.

55:29.342 --> 55:30.274
Come on.

55:36.316 --> 55:38.648
- General Heth.
- Sir. I beg to report.

55:38.852 --> 55:39.841
Yes.

55:40.320 --> 55:42.788
Very strange, sir.
The situation is very confused.

55:42.856 --> 55:43.914
What happened?

55:43.990 --> 55:46.584
I moved in this morning, as directed.

55:46.926 --> 55:50.521
I thought it was only a few militia,
but it was dismounted cavalry, sir.

55:51.097 --> 55:54.123
There weren't all that many,
and the boys wouldn't hold back.

55:54.300 --> 55:57.394
I thought we shouldn't be stopped
by a few dismounted cavalry...

55:57.470 --> 55:58.960
...but they made a good fight.

55:59.039 --> 56:01.098
They really put up a scrap, sir.

56:02.108 --> 56:03.200
Go on, General.

56:03.543 --> 56:05.511
Well, sir, they wouldn't leave.

56:05.879 --> 56:07.676
My boys got their dander up.

56:07.747 --> 56:10.215
We deployed the whole division
and went after them.

56:10.283 --> 56:13.013
We just about had them running
then all of a sudden...

56:13.086 --> 56:14.747
...they got infantry support.

56:14.821 --> 56:16.220
We got pushed back.

56:16.289 --> 56:20.783
Then we re-formed and tried again.
We couldn't just leave it to them, sir.

56:21.327 --> 56:24.728
Now there's more Yankee infantry coming.
I don't know how many.

56:24.798 --> 56:26.959
But I don't know
what else we could've done.

56:27.033 --> 56:29.365
It started as a minor scrap
with a few militia.

56:29.436 --> 56:32.496
The next thing I know,
I'm tangling with half the Union army.

56:33.673 --> 56:37.165
Things will get out of control, Mr. Heth.
That is why we have orders.

56:37.577 --> 56:40.011
- Is it possible you misunderstood them?
- No, sir.

56:40.780 --> 56:42.145
Can you identify those people?

56:42.215 --> 56:44.581
The infantry is the First Corps,
the Black Hats.

56:44.751 --> 56:47.652
There's another corps coming
that we haven't identified.

56:47.720 --> 56:50.450
I must have all possible information
on enemy strength.

56:50.523 --> 56:54.584
Major Taylor, I want you to ride forward
to the highest position and observe.

56:54.661 --> 56:56.253
- And do be careful.
- Yes, sir.

56:56.629 --> 56:58.529
- Sir, shall I attack?
- No, sir.

56:58.731 --> 57:00.665
We are not ready for full engagement.

57:00.733 --> 57:02.724
General Longstreet is not up
with his corps.

57:02.802 --> 57:04.599
Sir, the enemy is disorganized.

57:04.838 --> 57:08.239
If we throw all our forces in the field,
we will have the advantage.

57:09.509 --> 57:10.806
Is that our artillery?

57:11.511 --> 57:12.273
Yes, sir.

57:12.779 --> 57:15.179
I can't imagine what has happened
to General Stuart.

57:15.248 --> 57:17.648
- I've heard nothing. Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

57:17.717 --> 57:21.778
I have no idea of what lies in front of me.
It may be the entire federal army.

57:43.042 --> 57:45.533
Sir, compliments of Colonel Babbit.

57:45.879 --> 57:49.042
Rebels are coming from the north.
Your instructions, sir?

57:49.115 --> 57:51.675
That'll be Ewell's corps.
They're trying to flank us.

57:51.918 --> 57:54.580
We got to meet them
and force them to go on line.

57:54.854 --> 57:57.652
Tell Colonel Devin to get up that way
as quick as he can.

57:57.924 --> 58:01.325
We'll get Gamble's boys back in the saddle
and be there shortly.

58:24.083 --> 58:26.551
General Rodes has encountered
Yankee cavalry, sir.

58:26.619 --> 58:27.745
Buford's brigades.

58:28.154 --> 58:31.749
General Early's right behind him
and will be on the field within the hour.

58:35.361 --> 58:39.092
General Early may be attacked
by half the federal army within the hour.

58:39.732 --> 58:42.633
- Is that Pender's artillery?
- Yes, sir. He's up now, sir.

58:42.769 --> 58:46.068
Four batteries in position
with two more in reserve.

58:46.606 --> 58:50.975
With General Rodes attacking up there
and Pender and l, we have three divisions.

58:51.177 --> 58:52.644
We could sweep them.

58:53.179 --> 58:54.237
General, sir.

58:54.314 --> 58:57.010
I saw only two federal corps.
First and Eleventh.

58:57.250 --> 59:01.516
And General, I saw Early's lead columns
coming down north of Rodes's lines.

59:01.688 --> 59:03.588
He'll be engaged any minute, sir.

59:03.656 --> 59:07.251
Sir, we got 20,000 infantry coming down
almost behind the Union lines.

59:08.027 --> 59:09.426
It's perfect, sir.

59:10.363 --> 59:11.591
God's will.

59:13.266 --> 59:16.394
Gentlemen, it would appear
the fight is already underway.

59:17.036 --> 59:18.970
General Heth, you may attack, sir.

59:19.038 --> 59:21.268
My orders to all commanders: attack.

59:52.672 --> 59:53.661
Fire!

01:00:43.423 --> 01:00:46.256
Forward men, final brigade forward!

01:01:05.111 --> 01:01:07.545
Forward! For God's sake, forward!

01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:37.068
He's dead.

01:01:56.262 --> 01:02:00.255
One thing about this brigade
is we got our own special bugle call.

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:02.834
Ever hear tell of Dan Butterfield?

01:02:02.902 --> 01:02:05.268
What, General Butterfield?
What was with Hooker?

01:02:05.338 --> 01:02:06.669
That's the same fellow.

01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:10.400
- He used to be our brigade commander.
- Yeah, he was a pistol.

01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:13.911
- No man like him for having a good time.
- I don't know about that.

01:02:14.447 --> 01:02:16.813
But I know he used to like
to write bugle calls.

01:02:17.283 --> 01:02:19.843
The problem with this army is,
we got too many calls.

01:02:19.919 --> 01:02:23.446
We got a call for artillery, infantry,
get up and eat, retreat.

01:02:24.457 --> 01:02:28.018
Anyway, old Butterfield, he wrote
a special call for this here brigade.

01:02:28.494 --> 01:02:31.088
Say there is an order for this brigade,
you and me.

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:34.930
He'll be blowing his bugle, we will think
that order's for us when it wasn't.

01:02:35.368 --> 01:02:39.168
We'll follow that order anyway,
then we'll be in a world of hurt.

01:02:39.238 --> 01:02:41.604
Yeah, that happened to me once.
Us, that is.

01:02:41.707 --> 01:02:44.267
Half the regiment charged,
the other half retreated.

01:02:44.343 --> 01:02:45.810
You had your choice.

01:02:46.846 --> 01:02:48.939
This here brigade got a special call.

01:02:49.215 --> 01:02:51.979
You hear that call,
you know the next one is for you.

01:02:52.418 --> 01:02:53.749
It goes like this.

01:02:56.856 --> 01:02:58.050
Colonel, sir.

01:02:58.724 --> 01:03:00.453
Begging the Colonel's pardon.

01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:05.258
But would the Colonel please do us a favor
and get back on the damned horse?

01:03:05.832 --> 01:03:09.290
I'll tell you, sir,
it's not easy handling these new recruits...

01:03:09.869 --> 01:03:13.202
...when the officers act
like they ain't got any sense, sir.

01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:16.868
Lawrence, sir.

01:03:18.444 --> 01:03:20.537
We've gone over 20 miles today.

01:03:21.013 --> 01:03:23.447
We've gone over 100 miles in 5 days, sir.

01:03:26.319 --> 01:03:28.150
There's something going on.

01:03:35.328 --> 01:03:37.489
- Colonel Vincent, sir.
- Mister Chamberlain.

01:03:37.563 --> 01:03:39.758
Far cry from Bolton College,
wouldn't you say?

01:03:39.832 --> 01:03:41.459
No farther than Harvard Yard.

01:03:41.868 --> 01:03:45.395
Indeed. With luck, we'll both see
our alma maters again.

01:03:46.439 --> 01:03:49.636
In the meantime, Colonel,
you move your boys along as best you can.

01:03:50.042 --> 01:03:51.976
Two corps have engaged at Gettysburg.

01:03:52.378 --> 01:03:55.245
So we'll keep going through dark
and on until we get there.

01:03:55.481 --> 01:03:56.243
Yes, sir.

01:03:56.616 --> 01:03:57.514
God speed.

01:04:16.802 --> 01:04:17.894
Fire!

01:05:10.756 --> 01:05:12.087
They're running!

01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:22.134
General Pender begs to report
that the enemy is falling back.

01:05:22.201 --> 01:05:24.362
- They're on the run.
- Very well, Lieutenant.

01:05:27.073 --> 01:05:31.237
General Early says the enemy has caved in
on the left flank, going back to Gettysburg.

01:05:31.310 --> 01:05:34.108
- They're all running.
- Very well. Thank you, Corporal.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.705
Find General Hill's chief of artillery.

01:05:36.782 --> 01:05:39.979
Tell him I want fire placed on that hill.
As much fire as possible.

01:05:40.052 --> 01:05:41.679
- Yes, sir.
- Very well.

01:05:47.193 --> 01:05:48.717
- Major Taylor.
- Yes, sir.

01:05:48.828 --> 01:05:50.557
Deliver this message in person.

01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:53.827
Tell General Ewell the federal troops
are withdrawing in confusion.

01:05:54.266 --> 01:05:57.201
We must only push those people
in order to gain the heights.

01:05:57.937 --> 01:06:01.202
Tell him to take that hill, if practical.
The one beyond the town.

01:06:01.273 --> 01:06:02.399
Do you understand?

01:06:02.475 --> 01:06:04.204
- Yes, sir.
- Very well.

01:06:15.621 --> 01:06:17.054
Congratulations, General.

01:06:17.123 --> 01:06:18.454
I want you to see this.

01:06:18.524 --> 01:06:20.583
It's like second Manassas all over again.

01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:22.992
Couldn't have worked better
if we'd planned it.

01:06:23.062 --> 01:06:26.828
If we can take that hill,
I want it occupied by nightfall.

01:06:26.899 --> 01:06:29.959
Sir, the federal army has fallen back
through Gettysburg.

01:06:30.236 --> 01:06:32.636
They're reforming on the ridges
outside of town.

01:06:32.705 --> 01:06:33.763
Very well.

01:06:34.707 --> 01:06:37.369
This is almost perfect.
We got them where we want them.

01:06:38.044 --> 01:06:40.842
Swing south and east,
get between them and Lincoln...

01:06:40.946 --> 01:06:42.413
...find some high ground...

01:06:42.481 --> 01:06:44.176
...and they'll have to hit us.

01:06:44.283 --> 01:06:46.376
Then we have them, General.

01:06:46.485 --> 01:06:47.679
You mean disengage?

01:06:48.487 --> 01:06:50.546
I've always been under the impression...

01:06:50.623 --> 01:06:54.457
...that it was our strategy to conduct
a defensive campaign wherever possible...

01:06:54.527 --> 01:06:56.392
...in order to keep the army intact.

01:06:56.462 --> 01:06:58.657
Granted, but the situation has changed.

01:06:59.198 --> 01:07:01.462
- In what way?
- We've already pushed them back.

01:07:01.534 --> 01:07:03.502
They're on the run, vacating the town.

01:07:03.769 --> 01:07:06.738
How can we move off
in the face of the enemy?

01:07:07.039 --> 01:07:08.904
- Major Marshall?
- Yes, sir.

01:07:09.041 --> 01:07:11.839
I ordered firing on that hill,
but no cannons are firing.

01:07:11.911 --> 01:07:14.379
- Send over and find out why.
- I'll see to it, sir.

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:15.505
Thank you.

01:07:19.852 --> 01:07:21.649
What are you thinking, General?

01:07:24.156 --> 01:07:26.147
Maybe we should not have fought here.

01:07:26.425 --> 01:07:29.690
I know that. But we have prevailed.
The men have prevailed.

01:07:29.862 --> 01:07:31.454
Yes. They've always done that.

01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:34.363
But in the morning,
we may be outnumbered...

01:07:34.433 --> 01:07:37.766
...and they'll be entrenched
on the high ground.

01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:41.497
You know as well as l, we've never been
concerned with being outnumbered.

01:07:41.607 --> 01:07:43.404
That is true, sir. You are right.

01:07:43.642 --> 01:07:46.475
If we move south to Washington,
they have to pursue us.

01:07:46.579 --> 01:07:48.740
Then we can fight on ground
of our choosing.

01:07:49.048 --> 01:07:50.413
But the enemy is here.

01:07:50.983 --> 01:07:53.543
We did not want the fight,
but the fight is here.

01:07:53.619 --> 01:07:57.487
How can I ask this army to retreat
in the face of what they've done this day?

01:07:58.090 --> 01:08:00.217
Not retreat, sir. Re-deploy.

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:04.862
Our guns will move them off that hill
or Ewell will push them off.

01:08:04.930 --> 01:08:07.831
But if Meade is there tomorrow,
I can't move this army away.

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:09.060
I will attack him.

01:08:09.135 --> 01:08:12.866
If Meade is up there tomorrow,
it is because he wants us to attack him.

01:08:12.938 --> 01:08:15.873
We pushed back two corps,
but there are five more coming.

01:08:21.447 --> 01:08:23.915
General, I will bring up my boys
as soon as I can.

01:08:24.049 --> 01:08:24.912
Very well.

01:08:25.917 --> 01:08:27.112
- General?
- Sir?

01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:30.020
Your man Harrison there,
he was quite correct.

01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:34.482
Had it not been for him, this entire army
might have been destroyed in detail.

01:08:34.727 --> 01:08:38.060
The federal force might've been here
waiting when we turned around.

01:08:38.264 --> 01:08:40.129
I'm deeply grateful to you, sir.

01:09:13.966 --> 01:09:14.955
Hello, men.

01:09:16.635 --> 01:09:18.125
What outfit are you with?

01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:20.769
Archer's brigade, Heth's division.

01:09:21.439 --> 01:09:23.408
- Where are you from?
- Tennessee.

01:09:23.908 --> 01:09:24.898
How about you?

01:09:25.310 --> 01:09:26.073
Maine.

01:09:27.246 --> 01:09:28.736
I've never been to Tennessee.

01:09:28.981 --> 01:09:30.971
I reckon I've never been to Maine neither.

01:09:33.152 --> 01:09:35.676
I don't mean no disrespect
to you fighting men...

01:09:36.921 --> 01:09:41.325
...but sometimes I can't help but figure,
why are you fighting this war?

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:43.059
Why are you fighting it?

01:09:43.395 --> 01:09:46.886
To free the slaves, of course.
And to preserve the Union.

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:51.192
I don't know about other folk,
but I ain't fighting for no darkies.

01:09:52.004 --> 01:09:53.470
I'm fighting for my rights.

01:09:53.772 --> 01:09:55.603
That's what we're all fighting for.

01:09:55.674 --> 01:09:56.663
For your what?

01:09:56.809 --> 01:09:57.867
For our rights.

01:09:59.979 --> 01:10:03.005
Why is it you folks can't just live
the way you want to live...

01:10:03.082 --> 01:10:04.845
...and let us live the way we do?

01:10:05.985 --> 01:10:08.419
"Live and let live," I hear some folks say.

01:10:10.723 --> 01:10:13.783
Be a might less fuss and bother
if more folks took it to heart.

01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:17.952
Where'd you get captured?

01:10:18.330 --> 01:10:20.491
Railroad cut just west of Gettysburg town.

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:22.492
It wasn't a pretty sight.

01:10:24.336 --> 01:10:26.930
Many a good boy lost
a young and promising life.

01:10:28.874 --> 01:10:30.535
Some wore blue, some wore gray.

01:10:34.113 --> 01:10:35.740
Seen enough of this war?

01:10:37.182 --> 01:10:38.513
I guess I have.

01:10:39.752 --> 01:10:41.083
I guess I have, too.

01:10:42.354 --> 01:10:44.822
It looks like I'll be sitting out the rest of it.

01:10:48.661 --> 01:10:50.322
I appreciate you talking to me.

01:10:51.463 --> 01:10:52.987
See you in hell, Billy Yank.

01:10:54.533 --> 01:10:56.433
See you in hell, Johnny Reb.

01:11:05.978 --> 01:11:07.843
I have found a John Henry, sir.

01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:09.010
John who?

01:11:09.181 --> 01:11:12.514
A John Henry, sir. A runaway.
I heard him a-groaning.

01:11:26.365 --> 01:11:27.389
Is he wounded?

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.167
Don't know for sure.

01:11:35.741 --> 01:11:37.003
The man's exhausted.

01:11:37.409 --> 01:11:40.378
We'll get him something to eat.
The surgeon's on the way.

01:11:42.181 --> 01:11:45.344
- Did you get his name?
- He said something I couldn't understand.

01:11:45.417 --> 01:11:48.045
I can't understand anyone
south of Mason-Dixon.

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:49.417
Rebs or darkies.

01:12:00.332 --> 01:12:03.130
All right, men, as you were.
Sergeant, see to him.

01:12:14.413 --> 01:12:17.075
We used to have visitors from the South
before the war.

01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:20.346
They were always very polite, academic,
you understand.

01:12:21.787 --> 01:12:24.688
We stayed off the question of slavery
out of courtesy.

01:12:25.524 --> 01:12:28.425
But toward the end there was
no getting away from it...

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:32.087
...and yet I could never understand.
I don't now.

01:12:33.332 --> 01:12:34.731
I don't know why.

01:12:37.636 --> 01:12:39.194
And they fight so well.

01:12:47.179 --> 01:12:48.942
Tell me something, Buster...

01:12:50.416 --> 01:12:52.316
...what do you think of Negroes?

01:12:55.187 --> 01:12:56.916
Well, if you mean the race...

01:12:58.791 --> 01:13:00.122
...I don't really know.

01:13:01.126 --> 01:13:03.060
This is not a thing to be ashamed of.

01:13:03.595 --> 01:13:07.588
The thing is, you cannot judge a race.

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:11.230
Any man who judges by the group
is a pea-wit.

01:13:12.471 --> 01:13:14.803
You take men one at a time.

01:13:15.474 --> 01:13:17.635
To me, there was never any difference.

01:13:18.444 --> 01:13:20.378
- None at all?
- None at all.

01:13:20.446 --> 01:13:22.971
Of course, I haven't known
that many freed men...

01:13:23.048 --> 01:13:25.778
...but those I knew in Bangor, Portland...

01:13:27.619 --> 01:13:29.814
...you look in the eye, there was a man.

01:13:31.223 --> 01:13:34.056
There was a "divine spark,"
as my mother used to call it.

01:13:34.359 --> 01:13:35.826
That is all there is to it.

01:13:36.361 --> 01:13:37.828
Races are men.

01:13:39.932 --> 01:13:41.627
"What a piece of work is man.

01:13:42.401 --> 01:13:45.393
"How infinite in faculties and form,
and movement...

01:13:46.472 --> 01:13:48.064
"...how express and admirable.

01:13:50.576 --> 01:13:52.305
"In action, like an angel."

01:13:56.115 --> 01:13:58.447
Well, if he's an angel, all right then...

01:14:00.252 --> 01:14:02.686
...but he damn well must be a killer angel.

01:14:07.893 --> 01:14:11.192
Colonel, darling, you're a lovely man.

01:14:12.197 --> 01:14:16.463
I see a great vast difference between us,
yet I admire you, lad.

01:14:17.936 --> 01:14:20.871
You're an idealist, praise be.

01:14:22.741 --> 01:14:24.504
The truth is, Colonel...

01:14:25.878 --> 01:14:28.005
...there is no "divine spark."

01:14:29.548 --> 01:14:33.814
There's many a man alive no more of value
than a dead dog. Believe me.

01:14:34.553 --> 01:14:38.421
When you've seen them hang each other
the way I have back in the Old Country.

01:14:39.992 --> 01:14:40.822
Equality?

01:14:41.793 --> 01:14:46.287
What I'm fighting for is the right to prove
I'm a better man than many of them.

01:14:46.765 --> 01:14:51.202
Where have you seen this "divine spark"
in operation, Colonel?

01:14:52.704 --> 01:14:55.764
Where have you noted
this magnificent equality?

01:14:57.109 --> 01:15:00.044
No two things on earth are equal
or have an equal chance.

01:15:00.612 --> 01:15:02.512
Not a leaf, not a tree.

01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:07.314
There's many a man worse than me
and some better...

01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:11.617
...but I don't think race or country
matters a damn.

01:15:13.525 --> 01:15:15.186
What matters, Colonel...

01:15:18.330 --> 01:15:19.319
...is justice.

01:15:25.671 --> 01:15:27.298
Which is why I'm here.

01:15:28.674 --> 01:15:30.904
I'll be treated as I deserve...

01:15:32.411 --> 01:15:34.606
...not as my father deserved.

01:15:37.115 --> 01:15:38.582
I'm Kilrain...

01:15:39.251 --> 01:15:41.981
...and I damn all gentlemen.

01:15:46.391 --> 01:15:48.484
There is only one aristocracy...

01:15:50.329 --> 01:15:53.093
...and that is right here.

01:16:01.506 --> 01:16:04.100
And that's why we've got to win this war.

01:16:17.656 --> 01:16:18.645
Howdy.

01:16:19.725 --> 01:16:21.215
Howdy, General.

01:16:22.461 --> 01:16:24.827
Hello, my boys. Virginia has arrived!

01:16:34.673 --> 01:16:36.834
General Pickett presents his compliments...

01:16:36.908 --> 01:16:40.537
...and asks to <i>parler</i> with
the commanding general, <i>s'il vous plaît. </i>

01:16:41.346 --> 01:16:42.608
Hey, George.

01:16:43.982 --> 01:16:45.074
General.

01:16:50.656 --> 01:16:52.419
Good Lord, what is that smell?

01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:54.784
That's me. Ain't it lovely?

01:16:55.527 --> 01:16:57.188
He got it off a dead Frenchman.

01:16:57.429 --> 01:16:59.454
- Good evening to you, James.
- Hey, Lo.

01:16:59.531 --> 01:17:01.795
I did not get it off a dead Frenchman.

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:04.532
I bought it in a store
in Richmond with Sally.

01:17:04.603 --> 01:17:07.970
It did have a French name,
but Miss Corbell likes it.

01:17:09.308 --> 01:17:10.138
Excuse me.

01:17:10.208 --> 01:17:12.699
Gentlemen? Colonel Fremantle?

01:17:14.112 --> 01:17:16.580
Allow me to introduce
Major General George Pickett.

01:17:16.815 --> 01:17:19.511
General Pickett,
Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Fremantle...

01:17:19.584 --> 01:17:23.145
...of her Majesty's venerable
and elite Cold Stream Guards.

01:17:23.488 --> 01:17:25.979
Britain's military attaché
to the Confederacy.

01:17:26.058 --> 01:17:29.323
And, you might say,
the eyes and ears of Queen Victoria.

01:17:29.728 --> 01:17:33.220
Hardly sir. I'm merely an observer
and your humble guest.

01:17:36.668 --> 01:17:39.034
The fame of your regiment
has preceded you.

01:17:39.871 --> 01:17:42.738
General Pickett here
is our ranking strategist.

01:17:43.842 --> 01:17:48.472
The First Corps Army of Northern Virginia.
We refer all our deeper questions to him.

01:17:48.613 --> 01:17:50.240
They do. They do indeed.

01:17:50.582 --> 01:17:53.642
His record at West Point
is still the talk of both armies.

01:17:54.086 --> 01:17:58.318
You know I consider it unbecoming
to a soldier, all this book learning.

01:17:58.390 --> 01:18:01.450
- Book learning ain't for gentlemen, right?
- Nor that either.

01:18:02.494 --> 01:18:04.962
He graduated last in his class. Dead last.

01:18:05.564 --> 01:18:07.691
Quite a feat, considering his classmates.

01:18:10.202 --> 01:18:13.763
The Yankees got all the smart ones.
Look where it's got them.

01:18:16.274 --> 01:18:17.866
Let me present my commanders.

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:21.674
Each one of these chaps, as you might say,
commands a brigade of mine.

01:18:22.047 --> 01:18:24.538
Now this fellow here, this is Lo Armistead.

01:18:24.616 --> 01:18:27.176
Lo! That's short for Lothario.

01:18:27.552 --> 01:18:28.610
The lover!

01:18:29.154 --> 01:18:32.248
This here is Richard Brooke Garnet.
You'll pardon his limp.

01:18:32.324 --> 01:18:34.690
He got kicked by his horse the other day.

01:18:34.793 --> 01:18:36.021
That fellow there <i>... </i>

01:18:36.728 --> 01:18:37.956
That's Jim Kemper.

01:18:38.597 --> 01:18:40.997
You note the shifty eye,
the hand in the pocket.

01:18:41.466 --> 01:18:43.627
He's not even a West Pointer,
so watch him.

01:18:43.702 --> 01:18:46.967
He's a politician from Virginia.
Jimmy's only here for the votes.

01:18:47.239 --> 01:18:49.264
I was Speaker of the House in Virginia.

01:18:49.374 --> 01:18:53.276
As a matter of fact, I'd like to talk to you
about some political matters.

01:18:53.779 --> 01:18:55.371
You know the Queen, don't you?

01:18:55.781 --> 01:18:59.114
What I need to know
and tell my folks back home is:

01:18:59.384 --> 01:19:01.318
When are you going to do something...

01:19:01.386 --> 01:19:04.219
...about that damn Yankee blockade
out there on the water?

01:19:04.289 --> 01:19:06.223
Can you tell me something about that?

01:19:06.458 --> 01:19:09.484
Have you heard any news of old Winfield?

01:19:10.328 --> 01:19:11.727
Old Winnie boy?

01:19:12.531 --> 01:19:14.396
Hancock? Oh, yeah.

01:19:16.268 --> 01:19:18.065
Well, how's he doing?

01:19:18.603 --> 01:19:20.298
You're going to find out.

01:19:22.641 --> 01:19:25.940
He's got the Second Corps.

01:19:27.212 --> 01:19:30.340
He's headed this way.
Probably run into him in the next few days.

01:19:35.287 --> 01:19:37.050
I wish I could see him again.

01:19:38.490 --> 01:19:40.822
I haven't seen him since before the war.

01:19:43.395 --> 01:19:45.522
Never thought it would last this long.

01:19:46.465 --> 01:19:47.989
Me neither, Lo.

01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:51.168
I sure would like to talk to
old Hancock again.

01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:53.735
One more time.

01:19:58.343 --> 01:19:59.401
Well, why not?

01:20:01.813 --> 01:20:03.007
You wouldn't mind?

01:20:03.081 --> 01:20:04.048
Hell, no.

01:20:05.984 --> 01:20:07.349
I mean, really.

01:20:07.953 --> 01:20:12.083
Do you think it would be proper?
You know, ethical?

01:20:13.625 --> 01:20:15.718
When the time comes, and he's close...

01:20:16.194 --> 01:20:19.789
...just send a messenger over
under a flag of truce and go on over.

01:20:20.232 --> 01:20:21.563
Ain't nothing to it.

01:20:23.101 --> 01:20:25.331
Last time I saw him was in California.

01:20:26.605 --> 01:20:28.573
Right when the war was beginning...

01:20:29.241 --> 01:20:32.404
...the night before we all left
to go fight against each other.

01:20:34.012 --> 01:20:35.980
Old friends, off to war.

01:20:41.453 --> 01:20:42.681
How's your brigade?

01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:47.115
I've never seen troops anywhere
so ready for a brawl.

01:20:48.894 --> 01:20:51.920
I've got to give the old man credit.
A lot of credit for that.

01:20:52.464 --> 01:20:55.661
Who else could've held
this army together for so long?

01:20:57.502 --> 01:21:00.232
Remember what they used to say
about him?

01:21:00.372 --> 01:21:04.502
When he first took command?
They called him "Old Granny."

01:21:06.878 --> 01:21:09.608
Lord, what damn fools we were.

01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:13.380
Now when he passes...

01:21:14.252 --> 01:21:17.881
...the boys hush as if they had seen
an angel of the Lord.

01:21:20.458 --> 01:21:22.790
Have you ever seen anything like that?

01:21:24.296 --> 01:21:26.264
No. I can't say I have.

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:30.834
It's amazing what one honest man can do.

01:21:31.570 --> 01:21:33.663
One honest man and a cause.

01:21:36.174 --> 01:21:38.642
I don't think on that too much anymore.

01:21:41.012 --> 01:21:43.242
I guess my only cause is victory.

01:21:43.648 --> 01:21:46.515
This war comes as a nightmare.
You pick your nightmare side.

01:21:46.618 --> 01:21:48.779
Then you put your head down and win.

01:21:50.655 --> 01:21:52.179
Old gloomy Pete!

01:21:52.924 --> 01:21:54.357
You see, Colonel <i>... </i>

01:21:54.759 --> 01:21:58.525
The government derives its power
from the consent of the people.

01:21:58.697 --> 01:22:00.426
Every government, everywhere.

01:22:02.133 --> 01:22:04.363
Let me make this very plain to you, sir.

01:22:04.803 --> 01:22:08.102
We do not consent
and we will never consent.

01:22:08.974 --> 01:22:12.137
And what you've got to do is,
you've got to go back over there...

01:22:12.210 --> 01:22:15.407
...to your Parliament and you've got to
make it very plain to them.

01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:18.347
You've got to tell them
that what we're fighting for here...

01:22:18.516 --> 01:22:22.646
...is the freedom from what we consider
to be the rule of a foreign power.

01:22:22.721 --> 01:22:25.713
I mean, that's all we want.
That's what this war is all about.

01:22:26.224 --> 01:22:30.251
Now we established this country
in the first place...

01:22:30.528 --> 01:22:32.587
...with very strong state governments...

01:22:33.064 --> 01:22:34.725
...just for that very reason.

01:22:35.266 --> 01:22:37.598
I mean, let me put it to you this way.

01:22:37.902 --> 01:22:39.995
My home is in Virginia.

01:22:40.739 --> 01:22:43.537
The government of my home is home.

01:22:44.275 --> 01:22:46.800
Virginia would not allow itself to be ruled...

01:22:46.878 --> 01:22:49.472
...by some king over there in London.

01:22:49.881 --> 01:22:53.681
It's not about to let itself be ruled
by some president in Washington.

01:22:53.885 --> 01:22:57.252
Virginia, by God, sir,
is going to be run by Virginians.

01:22:57.522 --> 01:22:59.251
Oh, my. The Cause.

01:22:59.557 --> 01:23:01.582
Actually, Jimmy, I got a pair of kings.

01:23:01.793 --> 01:23:03.454
And it's all for the Yankees.

01:23:03.728 --> 01:23:05.593
The damn money-grubbing Yankees.

01:23:05.764 --> 01:23:08.324
I mean, those damn fools,
they don't get the message.

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:10.991
Always the darkies.
Nothing but the darkies.

01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:12.161
You know, Jim <i>... </i>

01:23:12.570 --> 01:23:14.765
Sit down. I think that my idea...

01:23:14.839 --> 01:23:19.902
...my analogy of a gentlemen's club
is fair enough. It's clear enough.

01:23:20.045 --> 01:23:21.478
Colonel, think on it now.

01:23:22.113 --> 01:23:24.946
Suppose that we all joined a club,
a gentlemen's club.

01:23:25.183 --> 01:23:28.949
After a time, several of the members
began to intrude themselves...

01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:31.318
...into our private lives, our home lives.

01:23:31.690 --> 01:23:34.420
Began telling us
what we could and couldn't do.

01:23:34.526 --> 01:23:37.518
Well, then, wouldn't any one of us
have the right to resign?

01:23:37.862 --> 01:23:39.625
I mean, just resign.

01:23:40.632 --> 01:23:41.792
That's what we did.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.460
That's what I did and now these people
are telling us that we don't have that right.

01:23:50.442 --> 01:23:52.000
I got to hand it to you.

01:23:52.711 --> 01:23:56.203
You certainly do have a talent
for trivializing the momentous...

01:23:56.314 --> 01:23:58.214
...and complicating the obvious.

01:23:58.316 --> 01:24:00.614
Have you ever considered
running for Congress?

01:24:00.719 --> 01:24:02.710
- No.
- It's a thought.

01:24:07.459 --> 01:24:09.324
What does Colonel Fremantle think?

01:24:10.061 --> 01:24:12.256
Will the British come in on our side?

01:24:12.564 --> 01:24:17.433
Hell, yeah. They'll come in
when we don't need them no more.

01:24:17.969 --> 01:24:21.928
Like some damn bank lending you money
when you're no longer in debt.

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:24.474
- Look here, Mr. Speaker <i>... </i>
- George.

01:24:28.913 --> 01:24:29.880
A word?

01:24:31.783 --> 01:24:32.977
Goodnight, Colonel.

01:24:33.885 --> 01:24:35.147
See you later.

01:24:39.791 --> 01:24:43.727
In the next few days, I believe
we're going to have a hell of a fight here.

01:24:44.062 --> 01:24:47.122
I want you to do everything necessary
to get your boys ready.

01:24:47.332 --> 01:24:50.199
You can start bringing them up
by the first light.

01:24:50.268 --> 01:24:52.600
I want you all in Gettysburg
by tomorrow night.

01:24:52.771 --> 01:24:54.033
Yes, sir.

01:25:21.366 --> 01:25:22.560
Good evening, John.

01:25:23.234 --> 01:25:26.726
I'm surprised you could find headquarters
with all that confusion.

01:25:28.306 --> 01:25:30.035
There's an old Indian saying:

01:25:30.108 --> 01:25:33.043
"Follow the cigar smoke
and find a fat man there."

01:25:55.333 --> 01:25:56.493
General Hancock.

01:25:56.601 --> 01:25:57.898
How are you, John?

01:25:58.069 --> 01:25:59.400
I'm all right.

01:25:59.504 --> 01:26:02.996
But the brigades are pretty shot up though.
I need to get refitted.

01:26:03.675 --> 01:26:07.475
Right. I'll see to it.
We know what you did this morning.

01:26:08.513 --> 01:26:11.539
- That was one hell of a piece of soldiering.
- Thank you, sir.

01:26:13.251 --> 01:26:15.845
Heard you were with John Reynolds
when he was killed.

01:26:16.654 --> 01:26:19.122
I'm sending the body up
to his folks in Lancaster.

01:26:19.190 --> 01:26:21.158
They might appreciate a note from you.

01:26:21.359 --> 01:26:22.417
I'll send it.

01:26:24.262 --> 01:26:25.559
He was a soldier.

01:26:27.232 --> 01:26:28.665
And a good friend.

01:26:30.301 --> 01:26:34.431
Three of us, Reynolds,
Lo Armistead and I came up together.

01:26:35.173 --> 01:26:36.435
Mexican War.

01:26:37.842 --> 01:26:39.002
California.

01:26:40.011 --> 01:26:41.239
We stayed close.

01:26:43.047 --> 01:26:46.039
I wonder how old Lo is doing.
If he's still alive.

01:26:47.652 --> 01:26:49.677
Heard he had one of Pickett's brigades.

01:26:50.088 --> 01:26:51.316
Under Longstreet.

01:27:01.266 --> 01:27:02.290
Remarkable.

01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:07.337
Just across the ridge.

01:27:11.609 --> 01:27:14.373
I'd like to see him again,
but not here. Not like this.

01:27:16.314 --> 01:27:18.612
Well, maybe after the war.

01:27:24.856 --> 01:27:26.721
Where do you want me in the morning?

01:27:27.258 --> 01:27:29.818
I want you to hold your position
on the extreme left.

01:27:29.894 --> 01:27:31.521
Get some rest if you can.

01:27:31.996 --> 01:27:33.759
We may need you in the morning.

01:27:34.032 --> 01:27:36.626
Jeb Stuart's still on the prowl
out there someplace.

01:27:38.169 --> 01:27:39.193
Yes, sir.

01:28:17.575 --> 01:28:19.065
Well, General Reynolds...

01:28:21.846 --> 01:28:23.643
...we held the high ground.

01:28:40.865 --> 01:28:42.423
General Trimble is waiting.

01:28:42.533 --> 01:28:44.364
- Will you see him now?
- Very well.

01:28:44.435 --> 01:28:48.201
Major, I want a scouting party sent out
posthaste to find General Stuart.

01:28:48.306 --> 01:28:50.604
- Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
- Thank you.

01:29:05.023 --> 01:29:06.354
General Trimble.

01:29:09.093 --> 01:29:12.859
Sir, I most respectfully request
another assignment.

01:29:19.070 --> 01:29:20.799
Do please go on, General.

01:29:21.406 --> 01:29:22.930
The man is disgrace.

01:29:23.641 --> 01:29:27.509
Sir, have you been listening at all
to what the aides have been telling you?

01:29:27.779 --> 01:29:30.942
Ask General Gordon or General Ewell.
Ask them.

01:29:32.784 --> 01:29:34.877
We could've taken that hill.

01:29:35.086 --> 01:29:37.350
God in his wisdom knows
we should've taken it.

01:29:37.422 --> 01:29:40.152
There was no one there at all
and it commanded the town.

01:29:41.559 --> 01:29:44.460
General Gordon saw it.
I mean, he was with us.

01:29:45.029 --> 01:29:47.759
Me and Ewell and Gordon...

01:29:48.433 --> 01:29:52.836
...all standing in the dark like idiots
with that bloody damned hill empty.

01:29:55.702 --> 01:29:57.431
I beg your pardon, General.

01:29:58.738 --> 01:30:02.196
That bloody damned hill was bare
as his bloody damned head!

01:30:03.076 --> 01:30:05.408
We all saw it, as God is my witness.

01:30:05.745 --> 01:30:07.076
We were all there.

01:30:07.981 --> 01:30:12.247
I said to him, "General Ewell,
we have got to take that hill."

01:30:13.086 --> 01:30:16.078
General Jackson wouldn't have stopped
with them on the run...

01:30:16.156 --> 01:30:18.590
...and plenty of light
on a hill like that empty.

01:30:19.159 --> 01:30:20.592
God help us!

01:30:21.995 --> 01:30:23.360
I don't know <i>... </i>

01:30:23.530 --> 01:30:24.758
I don't know why <i>... </i>

01:30:26.466 --> 01:30:27.990
Do please continue, General.

01:30:29.602 --> 01:30:30.534
Yes, sir.

01:30:32.939 --> 01:30:33.906
Sir.

01:30:35.375 --> 01:30:37.639
I said to General Ewell these words <i>... </i>

01:30:38.478 --> 01:30:39.809
I said to him:

01:30:40.547 --> 01:30:44.984
"Sir, give me one division
and I will take that hill."

01:30:46.319 --> 01:30:50.255
He said nothing.
He just stood there and stared at me.

01:30:51.124 --> 01:30:54.423
I said, "General Ewell,
give me one brigade...

01:30:55.095 --> 01:30:57.029
"...and I will take that hill."

01:30:58.498 --> 01:31:00.261
I was becoming disturbed, sir.

01:31:01.034 --> 01:31:05.664
And General Ewell put his arms behind him
and blinked.

01:31:06.339 --> 01:31:10.901
So I said, "General, give me one regiment...

01:31:11.177 --> 01:31:12.940
"...and I will take that hill."

01:31:14.447 --> 01:31:16.813
And he said nothing.

01:31:17.250 --> 01:31:19.013
He just stood there.

01:31:19.285 --> 01:31:22.652
I threw down my sword.
Down on the ground in front of him.

01:31:32.398 --> 01:31:33.990
We could have done it, sir.

01:31:34.968 --> 01:31:36.731
A blind man should have seen it.

01:31:39.606 --> 01:31:41.164
Now they're working up there.

01:31:42.375 --> 01:31:45.071
You can hear the axes
of the federal troops.

01:31:45.845 --> 01:31:47.244
And so in the morning...

01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:49.573
...many a good boy will die...

01:31:50.850 --> 01:31:52.442
...taking that hill.

01:31:54.988 --> 01:31:55.920
Sir.

01:31:57.524 --> 01:31:59.856
I must request another assignment.

01:32:08.601 --> 01:32:10.831
No, sir. That won't be necessary.

01:32:12.672 --> 01:32:14.401
You will be of great service.

01:32:15.241 --> 01:32:16.970
And I do thank you.

01:33:08.027 --> 01:33:09.289
General Meade, sir.

01:33:09.495 --> 01:33:13.192
Hancock. It's so damn dark out there
I can't see a thing.

01:33:15.668 --> 01:33:16.828
Gentlemen.

01:33:19.105 --> 01:33:20.800
I hope to God that this is...

01:33:22.108 --> 01:33:23.405
...good ground.

01:33:26.646 --> 01:33:29.479
Is this good ground, General?

01:33:30.984 --> 01:33:32.747
Is this a place to have an army?

01:33:33.419 --> 01:33:36.479
Very good ground, sir.

01:33:37.357 --> 01:33:38.790
I hope you are right.

01:33:39.859 --> 01:33:43.192
Because we are going to have a fight here
sure enough in the morning.

01:33:49.836 --> 01:33:52.634
- Will there be anything else, sir?
- No, thank you, Major.

01:33:52.906 --> 01:33:53.895
Very well.

01:34:23.636 --> 01:34:25.627
<i>In the morning is the great battle. </i>

01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:30.441
<i>Tomorrow or the next day</i>
<i>will determine the war. </i>

01:34:31.911 --> 01:34:33.538
<i>Virginia is here. </i>

01:34:34.013 --> 01:34:35.708
<i>All the South is here. </i>

01:34:36.749 --> 01:34:38.444
<i>What will you do tomorrow? </i>

01:34:40.353 --> 01:34:41.820
<i>In the morning... </i>

01:34:42.455 --> 01:34:45.856
<i>... the enemy will be up</i>
<i>in fortified positions on high ground. </i>

01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:49.494
<i>Longstreet's corps will be coming up... </i>

01:34:50.029 --> 01:34:52.793
<i>... and my boys will be ready</i>
<i>to finish the job. </i>

01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:57.327
<i>If I tell them to withdraw now? No, sir. </i>

01:34:58.304 --> 01:35:00.704
<i>They've been patient for far too long. </i>

01:35:01.741 --> 01:35:04.232
<i>With the enemy out there up on the hill... </i>

01:35:04.644 --> 01:35:06.976
<i>... they'll be ready to finish the job. </i>

01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:10.440
<i>But I don't even know</i>
<i>how much is up there. </i>

01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:13.043
<i>How many men? How many cannon? </i>

01:35:14.053 --> 01:35:16.613
<i>I don't know the ground or the flanks. </i>

01:35:17.757 --> 01:35:18.883
<i>I don't know. </i>

01:35:20.059 --> 01:35:22.653
<i>If I wait in the morning, </i>
<i>the early morning... </i>

01:35:23.563 --> 01:35:26.396
<i>... maybe Meade, under pressure, </i>
<i>will attack. </i>

01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:30.132
<i>That would make General Longstreet</i>
<i>very happy. </i>

01:35:31.971 --> 01:35:34.769
<i>But I don't think Meade will come down. </i>

01:35:35.308 --> 01:35:39.836
<i>And I don't think I can withdraw, so... </i>

01:35:41.681 --> 01:35:44.741
<i>... God's will, thy will be done. </i>

01:35:47.353 --> 01:35:49.253
Major Sorrel, you've met before.

01:35:49.589 --> 01:35:50.886
Thank you, General.

01:35:51.958 --> 01:35:55.553
The federal position was scouted
during the last several hours.

01:35:55.661 --> 01:35:57.253
We've drawn it up here.

01:35:57.330 --> 01:35:58.854
Now this is the situation.

01:35:59.332 --> 01:36:02.893
The position of the federal army
is in the shape of a fishhook.

01:36:03.102 --> 01:36:05.332
It starts here. You see these two hills?

01:36:05.505 --> 01:36:07.666
This one and the one with the cemetery.

01:36:07.974 --> 01:36:10.465
That is where they have concentrated
their troops.

01:36:10.943 --> 01:36:12.808
The hook starts there.

01:36:13.679 --> 01:36:16.807
Now it curves around and comes down
this low ridge to the south.

01:36:17.116 --> 01:36:19.914
Ending before two round hills
of high elevation.

01:36:20.319 --> 01:36:22.981
The federals have no troops
on those two hills.

01:36:23.756 --> 01:36:25.314
- Carry on, Major.
- Thank you.

01:36:26.325 --> 01:36:30.386
We now know that General Hancock
is in charge of the Union center.

01:36:30.663 --> 01:36:34.224
There are now perhaps 60,000
to 70,000 men already in position.

01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:35.824
Perhaps as high as 90,000.

01:36:40.506 --> 01:36:43.270
I spoke with General Ewell
of your suggestion...

01:36:43.509 --> 01:36:46.501
...that we move around to the right
to flank the federal army.

01:36:47.313 --> 01:36:50.874
And he is of the opinion that
withdrawing from Gettysburg...

01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:54.647
...and giving it back to the enemy,
would be very bad for morale.

01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:57.655
It is unnecessary.
It might even be dangerous.

01:36:57.890 --> 01:36:59.187
Do you disagree?

01:37:01.661 --> 01:37:02.855
We must attack.

01:37:04.597 --> 01:37:06.929
I would prefer not to fight
upon this ground...

01:37:06.999 --> 01:37:10.400
...but every moment we delay
the enemy uses to reinforce himself.

01:37:10.803 --> 01:37:13.465
We cannot support ourselves for long
in this country.

01:37:13.873 --> 01:37:16.899
We must not allow the federal army
to move around behind...

01:37:17.009 --> 01:37:18.977
...and cut us off from home. No, sir.

01:37:19.145 --> 01:37:21.045
We must strike him now.

01:37:25.118 --> 01:37:27.552
We pushed him yesterday
and he will remember it.

01:37:28.721 --> 01:37:33.488
The men are ready and they are eager.
I see no useful alternative.

01:37:34.026 --> 01:37:34.890
Yes, sir.

01:37:35.094 --> 01:37:36.425
Very well.

01:37:38.397 --> 01:37:39.455
Gentlemen.

01:37:40.833 --> 01:37:42.994
- Good morning, all.
- Good morning, sir.

01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:47.230
Longstreet will attack on the right
with the First Corps.

01:37:48.441 --> 01:37:49.669
Hill will support...

01:37:50.543 --> 01:37:51.976
...with Heth in reserve.

01:37:53.846 --> 01:37:57.009
Ewell's people on the left
will demonstrate to keep the enemy...

01:37:57.116 --> 01:37:59.482
...from reinforcing against our right flank.

01:37:59.552 --> 01:38:01.713
Yes, sir. But I still don't have Pickett.

01:38:02.054 --> 01:38:04.454
He's at the rear of column,
a full day's march.

01:38:04.657 --> 01:38:06.420
All I've got is Hood and McClaws.

01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:11.287
I do believe that Hood's
and McClaws's divisions will be sufficient.

01:38:12.331 --> 01:38:14.891
- With the General's permission.
- General Hood?

01:38:15.835 --> 01:38:20.033
Moving in front of those rocky heights,
we'll have enfilade fire...

01:38:20.139 --> 01:38:21.401
...coming down on us.

01:38:21.474 --> 01:38:23.704
Perhaps, but not for long. Your division...

01:38:23.809 --> 01:38:27.210
...will be up over this unoccupied hill,
the little, rocky one.

01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:29.510
From there you will threaten
the enemy flank.

01:38:29.582 --> 01:38:32.915
When you're heavily engaged,
General Ewell will strike from the left.

01:38:33.186 --> 01:38:34.210
Very well, sir.

01:38:35.821 --> 01:38:37.721
- General?
- Let's move out, gentlemen.

01:38:44.230 --> 01:38:46.858
General Barksdale,
is Mississippi ready for this day?

01:38:46.933 --> 01:38:48.696
- Mississippi is ready.
- Very well.

01:38:49.235 --> 01:38:50.725
Let's go to it, Sam.

01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:56.505
If he's right, General Lee...

01:38:57.476 --> 01:38:59.410
...then the war is over by sundown.

01:39:01.347 --> 01:39:02.336
We'll see.

01:39:03.282 --> 01:39:05.580
I don't like going in without Pickett.

01:39:05.651 --> 01:39:07.915
It's like going in with one boot off.

01:39:08.454 --> 01:39:10.285
I'll wait as long as I can.

01:39:11.991 --> 01:39:13.822
Do you have any idea of the force?

01:39:15.595 --> 01:39:19.998
We counted five corps, including
the two involved in yesterday's action.

01:39:20.533 --> 01:39:22.524
That don't mean how many might be...

01:39:22.602 --> 01:39:24.661
...hidden behind those hills there.

01:39:25.671 --> 01:39:29.232
And damn it, with Stuart gone,
there ain't no way of knowing for sure.

01:39:32.111 --> 01:39:34.511
Take good care of yourself today,
you hear?

01:39:35.748 --> 01:39:36.772
You too, Pete.

01:39:47.927 --> 01:39:49.360
With your permission, sir.

01:40:02.108 --> 01:40:04.076
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.

01:40:05.344 --> 01:40:08.836
That's Major General John Bell Hood,
but we call him Sam.

01:40:09.081 --> 01:40:13.211
One of my three division commanders.
Fellows from Texas and Alabama.

01:40:13.586 --> 01:40:16.214
You've been to Texas, as I recall.

01:40:16.489 --> 01:40:19.014
Yes. Actually that's where I came through.

01:40:19.659 --> 01:40:23.186
Courtesy of the Yankee Navy
who denied me any other point of entry.

01:40:25.498 --> 01:40:27.728
It's a marvelous place, Texas.

01:40:28.167 --> 01:40:30.965
Full of red Indians and Mexicans...

01:40:31.037 --> 01:40:33.870
...cowboys, bandits and desperados.

01:40:35.174 --> 01:40:37.540
Even hotter and more humid
than this place.

01:40:38.311 --> 01:40:40.142
If that's possible.

01:40:40.946 --> 01:40:42.106
That fellow Hood...

01:40:42.415 --> 01:40:45.384
...does his performance in battle
match his appearance?

01:40:45.451 --> 01:40:47.282
He really does look the part.

01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:49.282
He does his job.

01:40:50.690 --> 01:40:52.624
Most interesting army, I must say.

01:40:53.759 --> 01:40:57.217
Virginia gentlemen fighting
alongside Texas frontiersmen...

01:40:57.997 --> 01:41:00.727
...and bayou bushwhackers from Louisiana.

01:41:01.334 --> 01:41:03.666
Drawn together from across a continent.

01:41:05.237 --> 01:41:08.900
Having traveled a good piece of it myself,
I feel a part...

01:41:09.108 --> 01:41:12.134
...or almost a member of this enterprise.

01:41:13.579 --> 01:41:17.811
You call yourselves Americans,
but you're really transplanted Englishmen.

01:41:18.351 --> 01:41:21.411
Look at your names, Lee, Hood...

01:41:21.554 --> 01:41:23.886
...Longstreet, Jackson, Stuart.

01:41:23.956 --> 01:41:25.253
My people were Dutch.

01:41:25.324 --> 01:41:29.556
And the same for your adversaries.
Meade, Hooker, Hancock, and...

01:41:30.796 --> 01:41:33.731
...shall I say? Lincoln.

01:41:36.235 --> 01:41:40.934
The same God. Same language.
Same culture and history.

01:41:41.006 --> 01:41:45.500
The same songs, stories, legends, myths.

01:41:46.679 --> 01:41:48.044
But different dreams.

01:41:49.582 --> 01:41:50.913
Different dreams.

01:41:52.651 --> 01:41:55.119
It's so very sad. Very sad.

01:41:55.988 --> 01:41:58.548
You English had your own civil war once,
didn't you?

01:41:59.725 --> 01:42:02.057
That was ages ago.
We wouldn't dream of it now.

01:42:02.828 --> 01:42:04.625
Cavaliers and Roundheads.

01:42:04.930 --> 01:42:06.921
"Off with his head! "

01:42:08.734 --> 01:42:10.065
Heads lying everywhere.

01:42:10.302 --> 01:42:13.499
One could hardly take a step
without tripping over a fallen crown.

01:42:13.773 --> 01:42:15.673
We're much more civilized now.

01:42:15.741 --> 01:42:17.333
I assure you.

01:42:18.344 --> 01:42:20.812
We have so much in common,
your country and mine.

01:42:21.313 --> 01:42:24.305
I honestly hope
that we shall become allies.

01:42:25.151 --> 01:42:29.212
Your government would never ally itself
with a Confederacy...

01:42:29.422 --> 01:42:32.619
...that had the institution of slavery.
You know that. So do I.

01:42:40.232 --> 01:42:43.463
We should have freed the slaves,
then fired on Fort Sumter.

01:42:48.007 --> 01:42:52.637
I guess we Southerners and you English
have at least one thing in common.

01:42:53.446 --> 01:42:56.415
We'd rather lose the war
than admit to the mistake.

01:42:58.184 --> 01:43:00.914
We whooped you British twice
as I recollect.

01:43:03.422 --> 01:43:06.687
Your candor is admirable,
if somewhat eccentric.

01:43:07.827 --> 01:43:10.193
A little eccentricity is good for a general.

01:43:10.863 --> 01:43:14.560
We Southerners like our men religious
and a little bit mad.

01:43:15.968 --> 01:43:18.835
I suspect that's why the women
fall in love with preachers.

01:44:02.781 --> 01:44:05.978
<i>In nomine pater, et filii, </i>
<i>et spiritus sancti. </i>

01:44:06.719 --> 01:44:07.708
Amen.

01:44:08.354 --> 01:44:09.787
General Longstreet.

01:44:11.090 --> 01:44:13.081
Do you mind if I accompany you?

01:44:13.158 --> 01:44:15.820
Not at all. I'm very glad
to have you with us, sir.

01:44:17.363 --> 01:44:19.729
The heat reminds me of Mexico.

01:44:20.232 --> 01:44:22.200
Yes, but there it was very dry.

01:44:23.202 --> 01:44:24.760
That was a good outfit.

01:44:25.771 --> 01:44:29.730
I remember storming the ramparts
of Chapultapec with old George Pickett.

01:44:30.843 --> 01:44:34.779
Reynolds <i>... </i> My old friend,
Ulysses Sam Grant.

01:44:34.947 --> 01:44:37.814
- There was some good men in that army.
- Yes indeed.

01:44:37.883 --> 01:44:41.341
Some of those men are waiting for us now
up ahead on those ridges.

01:44:43.322 --> 01:44:46.655
I don't know. I sometimes feel troubled.

01:44:47.927 --> 01:44:51.226
Those fellows, those boys in blue,
they never quite seem the enemy.

01:44:51.797 --> 01:44:52.764
I know.

01:44:54.133 --> 01:44:57.296
I used to command some of those boys.
Swore an oath, too.

01:45:00.372 --> 01:45:03.705
I couldn't fight against Georgia
and South Carolina.

01:45:04.810 --> 01:45:06.300
Not against my own family.

01:45:06.378 --> 01:45:09.506
No, sir. There was always a higher duty
to Virginia.

01:45:10.282 --> 01:45:11.715
That was our first duty.

01:45:11.784 --> 01:45:14.150
There was never any question about that.

01:45:14.219 --> 01:45:16.517
- I guess so.
- Let us not think about that now.

01:45:17.222 --> 01:45:19.122
The issue is in God's hands.

01:45:19.458 --> 01:45:20.891
We can only do our duty.

01:45:22.695 --> 01:45:23.787
General?

01:45:24.930 --> 01:45:27.160
Soldiering has one great trap.

01:45:28.267 --> 01:45:30.792
To be a good soldier
you must love the army.

01:45:31.403 --> 01:45:34.998
To be a good commander,
you must be willing to order the death...

01:45:35.074 --> 01:45:36.507
...of the thing you love.

01:45:37.309 --> 01:45:39.903
We do not fear our own death, you and I.

01:45:40.145 --> 01:45:42.136
But there comes a time <i>... </i>

01:45:43.349 --> 01:45:46.079
We are never quite prepared
for so many to die.

01:45:46.619 --> 01:45:51.113
We do expect the occasional empty chair.
A salute to fallen comrades...

01:45:52.358 --> 01:45:54.952
...but this war goes on and on
and the men die...

01:45:55.027 --> 01:45:56.824
...and the price gets ever higher.

01:45:57.796 --> 01:46:02.756
We are prepared to lose some of us,
but we are never prepared to lose all of us.

01:46:03.469 --> 01:46:05.596
And there is the great trap, General.

01:46:06.238 --> 01:46:08.433
When you attack,
you must hold nothing back.

01:46:08.507 --> 01:46:10.498
You must commit yourself totally.

01:46:10.709 --> 01:46:13.610
We are adrift here in a sea of blood,
and I want it to end.

01:46:16.315 --> 01:46:18.249
I want this to be the final battle.

01:46:24.857 --> 01:46:28.224
I woke up this morning and I half thought
he'd be gone, George Meade.

01:46:28.794 --> 01:46:31.285
That he would not want to fight here.
Yes, sir.

01:46:31.930 --> 01:46:34.592
I woke up and I thought
Meade will be gone...

01:46:34.667 --> 01:46:37.465
...and this war will go on and on and on.

01:46:40.806 --> 01:46:42.467
We'll make him sorry he stayed.

01:46:46.512 --> 01:46:47.979
God go with you, General.

01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:49.445
And with you, General.

01:46:57.990 --> 01:46:59.548
That's mostly to the south.

01:46:59.625 --> 01:47:03.618
I thought the rebs were all in Gettysburg.
You don't suppose they're flanking again?

01:47:03.796 --> 01:47:06.663
Mama's favorite. Let's go.

01:47:06.899 --> 01:47:08.833
Lawrence, what's happening?

01:47:09.001 --> 01:47:11.936
Sir, Corporal Eastbrook reporting back, sir.

01:47:12.004 --> 01:47:14.939
- Brook, I thought you were on sick call.
- Yes, sir.

01:47:15.007 --> 01:47:16.099
How are you now?

01:47:16.175 --> 01:47:18.336
It's my stomach.
I've been throwing up, sir.

01:47:18.410 --> 01:47:19.775
It's something you ate.

01:47:19.912 --> 01:47:22.506
- Finish up. We're about to move out.
- Yes, sir.

01:47:24.116 --> 01:47:26.311
- Colonel Chamberlain.
- Colonel Vincent.

01:47:26.418 --> 01:47:29.080
Form your men.
Follow me and prepare to double quick.

01:47:29.154 --> 01:47:31.588
We're going to the top of that hill,
right there.

01:47:31.757 --> 01:47:33.918
- You hear that?
- Yes, sir. I'll set it up.

01:47:33.992 --> 01:47:36.426
The rebels are stacking up on our left flank.

01:47:36.495 --> 01:47:38.087
And we've got to follow them.

01:47:38.230 --> 01:47:39.697
- Make haste.
- Yes, sir.

01:47:40.265 --> 01:47:41.596
Sound the assembly!

01:47:44.069 --> 01:47:45.058
Follow me.

01:47:50.576 --> 01:47:52.407
Powder in! Load!

01:48:01.553 --> 01:48:02.611
General.

01:48:04.223 --> 01:48:07.818
Look here,
the ground is strewn with boulders.

01:48:08.460 --> 01:48:11.258
The soldiers up there are entrenched
all over the ground.

01:48:11.363 --> 01:48:13.058
And there are guns in the rocks.

01:48:13.766 --> 01:48:15.996
Every move I make is observed.

01:48:17.770 --> 01:48:21.206
If I attack as ordered,
I lose half my division.

01:48:21.974 --> 01:48:25.876
And they'll be looking down our throats
at us from that hill right there.

01:48:27.012 --> 01:48:29.310
We must move around to the right, sir.

01:48:29.748 --> 01:48:31.272
And take them from the rear.

01:48:32.518 --> 01:48:36.648
The commanding general will not allow
a flanking movement around those hills.

01:48:37.556 --> 01:48:39.888
I argued it yesterday.
I argued it all morning.

01:48:39.958 --> 01:48:42.426
I've been arguing against any attack at all.

01:48:42.628 --> 01:48:44.994
I can't call this one off. You know it.

01:48:46.265 --> 01:48:49.166
Let me move up the big round hill
to the south.

01:48:49.368 --> 01:48:52.098
Nobody is on that.
If I could get a battery up there <i>... </i>

01:48:52.171 --> 01:48:53.570
There ain't enough time.

01:48:53.839 --> 01:48:56.330
You'd have cut down trees
to place your artillery.

01:48:56.408 --> 01:48:58.569
It would be dark before you were in action.

01:48:59.645 --> 01:49:02.546
One the other hand,
if they get batteries up there...

01:49:02.648 --> 01:49:06.015
...we'll need buckets to catch the lead.
You've got to take that hill.

01:49:06.718 --> 01:49:09.346
They don't even need guns to defend that.

01:49:09.421 --> 01:49:11.753
All they need to do
is roll rocks down on you.

01:49:12.057 --> 01:49:13.490
Just take it.

01:49:13.559 --> 01:49:14.491
General.

01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:16.653
I do this under protest.

01:49:17.029 --> 01:49:18.758
Sam, you are the best I got.

01:49:19.731 --> 01:49:22.564
Now sir, if you are ready,
why don't you take that hill?

01:49:40.853 --> 01:49:42.377
They're overshooting again.

01:49:42.588 --> 01:49:45.751
Hey, fellows, you notice how
that reb artillery always overshoots?

01:49:46.825 --> 01:49:48.019
- Tom?
- Yes, sir.

01:49:48.493 --> 01:49:51.428
Another one a bit closer
and it could be hard day for mother.

01:49:51.496 --> 01:49:53.760
Go back to the rear.
Watch out for stragglers.

01:49:53.832 --> 01:49:55.424
Keep your distance from me.

01:49:56.301 --> 01:49:57.825
Lawrence, I don't <i>... </i>

01:50:40.212 --> 01:50:42.271
The whole damn reb army is down there...

01:50:42.714 --> 01:50:46.309
...and coming up around our flanks.
They could be here any minute.

01:50:46.685 --> 01:50:49.950
We've got to hold this place.
We've got to hold it.

01:50:52.457 --> 01:50:54.891
Well, all right. I place you here.

01:50:55.193 --> 01:50:58.924
Put your colors here, and set your regiment
to the left of this line.

01:50:59.197 --> 01:51:02.428
The rest of the brigade
will form on your right. Understood?

01:51:02.501 --> 01:51:04.560
- Yes. Ellis, this is the point.
- Sir.

01:51:04.836 --> 01:51:07.031
Your regiment is to the left of this point.

01:51:07.673 --> 01:51:10.699
- Colonel, sir. You're the end of the line.
- Yes.

01:51:11.777 --> 01:51:15.474
You're the extreme left of the Union army.
Understood?

01:51:16.515 --> 01:51:18.949
The line moves from here
back to Cemetery Hill...

01:51:19.217 --> 01:51:21.378
...but it ends here.
- Understood.

01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:23.979
You can't withdraw under any condition.

01:51:25.557 --> 01:51:27.491
If you go, this line will be flanked.

01:51:28.193 --> 01:51:30.923
If you go, the enemy will sweep up
over the hillside...

01:51:30.996 --> 01:51:33.157
...and take this entire army from the rear.

01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:37.191
- You must defend this place to the last.
- Yes, sir.

01:51:39.905 --> 01:51:41.930
Now we'll see how professors fight.

01:51:44.009 --> 01:51:46.842
Ellis, position the regiment.
All company commanders here.

01:51:46.912 --> 01:51:47.844
Yes, sir.

01:51:48.146 --> 01:51:49.613
Sharpshooters to the left!

01:51:50.716 --> 01:51:52.911
Battalion on the right!

01:51:53.018 --> 01:51:55.350
Now file into line. March.

01:52:03.061 --> 01:52:04.892
Bugler, sound the officer's call.

01:52:11.703 --> 01:52:15.070
<i>"Hold to the last. " To the last what? </i>

01:52:16.641 --> 01:52:18.370
<i>Exercise in rhetoric. </i>

01:52:18.944 --> 01:52:21.640
<i>Last shell? Last man? </i>

01:52:22.047 --> 01:52:24.982
<i>Last foot of ground? Last reb? </i>

01:52:37.796 --> 01:52:38.785
Advance!

01:52:40.665 --> 01:52:41.654
Move out!

01:53:23.075 --> 01:53:24.975
Turn those guns around!

01:53:30.482 --> 01:53:33.542
The 83rd Pennsylvania, 44th New York,
and 16th Michigan...

01:53:33.785 --> 01:53:37.243
...will be moving in to our right.
But if you look left, you will see...

01:53:37.322 --> 01:53:39.085
...that there is no one there.

01:53:39.357 --> 01:53:42.588
Beause we're the end of the line.
The Union army stops here.

01:53:42.661 --> 01:53:43.889
We are the flank.

01:53:44.996 --> 01:53:46.657
Do you understand, gentlemen?

01:53:46.731 --> 01:53:49.666
We cannot retreat. We cannot withdraw.

01:53:49.901 --> 01:53:52.734
We are going to have to be stubborn today.

01:53:54.739 --> 01:53:57.173
Put the boys in position,
tell them to stay down.

01:53:57.242 --> 01:54:00.177
Pile the rocks up high
for the best protection you can.

01:54:00.445 --> 01:54:02.811
I want the reserve pulled back
about 20 yards.

01:54:02.914 --> 01:54:04.745
Sloping ground is good ground.

01:54:04.850 --> 01:54:08.047
If you have any breakthroughs,
men wounded, a hole in the line...

01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:10.748
...plug it with the reserve.
How's our ammunition?

01:54:10.822 --> 01:54:12.915
Sir, I think about 60 rounds per man.

01:54:13.058 --> 01:54:16.221
That's good. 60 rounds. I think <i>... </i>
Yes, that's adequate.

01:54:16.294 --> 01:54:17.488
Any questions?

01:54:17.562 --> 01:54:18.392
Colonel.

01:54:18.463 --> 01:54:21.830
It seems to me
the fighting is on that side of the hill.

01:54:22.100 --> 01:54:24.295
It seems to me that we're the back door.

01:54:24.369 --> 01:54:27.167
And everything's going on
at the front door.

01:54:28.907 --> 01:54:32.741
That hill is steep and rocky. It's bare.
To come straight up it is impossible.

01:54:33.111 --> 01:54:35.238
The reb army is going to swing around it.

01:54:35.313 --> 01:54:38.612
It'll come up through that notch
right over there.

01:54:38.683 --> 01:54:42.210
It'll move under the cover of trees,
trying to get around the flank.

01:54:43.855 --> 01:54:45.117
And gentlemen...

01:54:46.124 --> 01:54:47.591
...we are the flank.

01:54:50.395 --> 01:54:51.453
Gentlemen.

01:54:59.971 --> 01:55:01.302
God go with you.

01:55:27.566 --> 01:55:30.433
Captain Clark,
take the right side from the 83rd...

01:55:30.502 --> 01:55:32.561
...over in this direction to the center.

01:55:32.637 --> 01:55:35.936
Ellis, take the left but be watchful.
Your flank will be in the air.

01:55:39.044 --> 01:55:41.410
- Colonel, sir.
- Corporal Eastbrook?

01:55:41.479 --> 01:55:45.540
What do I do with these prisoners?
The hard heads of the Second Maine.

01:55:49.454 --> 01:55:51.081
Do any of you care to join us?

01:55:51.923 --> 01:55:54.653
- The rebs really coming?
- They're really coming.

01:55:55.460 --> 01:55:58.623
Well, it's kind of dull
just sitting here watching, sir.

01:55:58.863 --> 01:56:01.661
For any man who joins us,
there will be no court martial.

01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:09.901
No man will call me a coward.

01:56:15.847 --> 01:56:16.836
Why not?

01:56:23.021 --> 01:56:26.684
I'll waste no man to guard you.
I expect you to be here when this is over.

01:56:26.758 --> 01:56:30.091
- Let's get these fellows some muskets.
- There are no muskets, sir.

01:56:33.231 --> 01:56:34.664
Wait here for a bit.

01:56:34.733 --> 01:56:37.065
There will be guns available
in a little while.

01:56:41.406 --> 01:56:44.239
That's the New York boys.
The rebs must be getting closer.

01:56:44.309 --> 01:56:45.776
Must be moving this way.

01:56:47.746 --> 01:56:49.509
Private Foss is praying.

01:56:54.019 --> 01:56:56.817
- Will you put in a kind word for me?
- Yes, sir.

01:57:04.296 --> 01:57:06.628
- You're the Merrill brothers, right?
- Yes, sir.

01:57:06.698 --> 01:57:08.563
Boys, why aren't you on the ground?

01:57:08.667 --> 01:57:11.227
Sir, I can't shoot worth a darn lying down.

01:57:11.303 --> 01:57:14.534
Never could. Bill neither.
We like to fight standing.

01:57:14.639 --> 01:57:16.539
I suggest you find a thicker tree.

01:57:16.675 --> 01:57:17.699
Here they come!

01:57:22.681 --> 01:57:25.514
I want you to stay with me,
but you keep down.

01:57:25.717 --> 01:57:26.809
Buster!

01:57:27.719 --> 01:57:30.153
I bet the whole damn reb army
is coming this way.

01:57:30.288 --> 01:57:32.984
Walk down the line.
Tell the boys to get good cover.

01:57:33.058 --> 01:57:35.356
Pile the rocks high and fire carefully.

01:57:35.427 --> 01:57:37.395
- Go down and come back.
- Right.

01:57:37.495 --> 01:57:39.190
You got to keep an eye on them.

01:57:39.297 --> 01:57:42.425
Some of them load but never fire.
They just keep right on loading.

01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:45.162
Some come home with
eight bullets rammed up the barrel.

01:57:45.236 --> 01:57:46.669
Never fired a shot.

01:57:49.274 --> 01:57:50.206
Sir.

01:57:54.846 --> 01:57:56.279
Fire!

01:58:49.567 --> 01:58:51.592
Keep up your fire, boys!

01:58:56.708 --> 01:58:57.902
Keep your head down.

01:58:58.476 --> 01:58:59.966
Watch your left side.

01:59:07.719 --> 01:59:09.380
Keep up your fire!

02:00:06.945 --> 02:00:08.572
They're falling back.

02:00:08.646 --> 02:00:10.477
They'll be back in a minute.

02:00:10.548 --> 02:00:12.709
- How are we doing?
- We're doing fine.

02:00:13.918 --> 02:00:15.886
- Colonel.
- Captain Clark, anybody hurt?

02:00:15.954 --> 02:00:18.548
- Head and shoulder wounds.
- They didn't hit the left.

02:00:18.623 --> 02:00:21.353
They're moving out that way.
Can you see them, sir?

02:00:21.426 --> 02:00:23.724
They're coming again, boys!

02:01:38.736 --> 02:01:41.068
Colonel, look here.

02:01:41.439 --> 02:01:44.431
A new regiment has arrived
that's moving against the left.

02:01:44.509 --> 02:01:46.272
It's out there. Do you see them?

02:01:46.844 --> 02:01:48.641
Double quick!

02:01:49.614 --> 02:01:52.344
I don't think we'll able to hold another one.

02:01:52.417 --> 02:01:55.147
- Get all company commanders up here.
- On the double.

02:01:57.322 --> 02:01:59.950
- Sergeant Owen!
- Yes, sir.

02:02:00.825 --> 02:02:04.352
Get up to the top of that hill
and report me the situation from up there.

02:02:04.495 --> 02:02:05.519
Yes, sir.

02:02:23.414 --> 02:02:25.848
We're about to be flanked.
Here's what we'll do.

02:02:26.751 --> 02:02:29.015
I want you to keep up
a good hot masking fire.

02:02:29.253 --> 02:02:32.347
Keep a tight hold on the 83rd,
on old Pennsylvania, over there.

02:02:34.025 --> 02:02:35.617
I want no break in the line.

02:02:35.793 --> 02:02:38.660
Captain Clark, that's you.
You understand? No breaks.

02:02:39.530 --> 02:02:41.998
Right wing will sidestep to the left...

02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:45.164
...thinning out to twice
the present distance.

02:02:45.236 --> 02:02:48.330
You see the colors?
They will end up down to the extreme left.

02:02:48.906 --> 02:02:52.603
When you reach that point,
we are going to refuse the line.

02:02:53.711 --> 02:02:54.643
Understand?

02:02:54.712 --> 02:02:56.771
We'll form a new line at right angles.

02:02:56.848 --> 02:02:59.180
We'll pull up as much of a reserve
as possible.

02:02:59.250 --> 02:03:02.344
We've got to be able to counter-attack
whenever there's a hole.

02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:04.047
- Any questions?
- No, sir.

02:03:04.322 --> 02:03:05.721
Fine. Move!

02:03:06.991 --> 02:03:09.357
Lieutenant. You fellows, on the double.

02:03:21.973 --> 02:03:22.997
Come on!

02:04:06.718 --> 02:04:09.084
- How are you, Andrew?
- I'm fine, sir. And you?

02:04:09.253 --> 02:04:10.311
A bit worn.

02:04:10.955 --> 02:04:14.755
- The boys are putting up one hell of a fight.
- They are indeed.

02:05:23.761 --> 02:05:25.922
I got me one. I got me a reb.

02:05:27.198 --> 02:05:28.756
Buster! Are you all right?

02:05:28.833 --> 02:05:32.030
I'll be fine in a minute,
but plays hell with me target practice.

02:05:32.170 --> 02:05:33.637
The surgeon will see to it.

02:05:33.704 --> 02:05:36.070
No. A little bandage is all I'll be needing.

02:05:36.207 --> 02:05:38.767
A few minutes off my feet.
Me brogans are killing me.

02:05:38.843 --> 02:05:41.209
Colonel, my men are getting low
on ammunition.

02:05:41.579 --> 02:05:44.104
Go over to the 83rd.
Ask them to send what they can.

02:05:44.182 --> 02:05:47.845
Lieutenant, go get from the wounded
and from the others anything you can.

02:05:47.952 --> 02:05:51.319
- Pick up what you can from anywhere.
- Here they come, sir!

02:06:38.236 --> 02:06:40.966
Keep up the fire!
Fill your holes down here!

02:07:22.647 --> 02:07:23.978
There they go!

02:07:36.527 --> 02:07:37.960
I'll be damned.

02:07:39.964 --> 02:07:43.024
They keep coming!
How long are they going to keep coming?

02:07:43.834 --> 02:07:47.031
I don't have much left. I got two shots.
That's what I got.

02:07:47.305 --> 02:07:50.502
They keep coming on the flanks.
They keep moving to the left more.

02:07:51.142 --> 02:07:54.737
They can't send help from the 83rd.
They say they got their own troubles.

02:07:54.812 --> 02:07:58.270
- Colonel, sir! We'd like to report.
- What?

02:07:58.816 --> 02:08:00.249
Vincent is badly wounded.

02:08:01.018 --> 02:08:03.452
He got hit a few minutes
after the fight started.

02:08:03.521 --> 02:08:06.979
We've been reinforced at the top of the hill
by Weed's brigade up front.

02:08:07.058 --> 02:08:09.219
This is what they tell me.
But Weed is dead.

02:08:09.293 --> 02:08:11.921
So they moved Hazlett's
battery of artillery up there.

02:08:11.996 --> 02:08:14.123
But Hazlett's dead. Far as I can tell...

02:08:14.198 --> 02:08:16.257
Can you can get ammunition
from up there?

02:08:16.334 --> 02:08:18.962
I don't know. It's a mess.
But they're holding good.

02:08:19.036 --> 02:08:21.163
The rebs are having a hard time climbing.

02:08:21.238 --> 02:08:23.604
- It's a steep hill.
- We'll need the ammunition.

02:08:23.674 --> 02:08:26.142
Colonel, sir, the better of my men
are wounded.

02:08:26.544 --> 02:08:29.809
If the rebs come up that hill any stronger,
we can't stop them.

02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:32.610
Send out word to take ammunition
from the wounded.

02:08:32.683 --> 02:08:34.651
- Go!
- Here they come again!

02:08:36.787 --> 02:08:38.186
Ready, boys!

02:08:59.643 --> 02:09:01.873
Come on, keep it coming! Keep it up, lads!

02:09:41.218 --> 02:09:42.310
Pour it on, boys!

02:09:53.164 --> 02:09:55.394
Keep at them! Keep up your fire!

02:10:12.616 --> 02:10:14.413
Here they come, boys!

02:11:33.464 --> 02:11:35.022
Go plug that hole over there!

02:12:35.526 --> 02:12:37.118
Sir, half my men are down.

02:12:37.194 --> 02:12:39.754
Most of the rest are wounded.
The left is too thin.

02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:41.730
- How is our ammunition?
- Almost gone.

02:12:41.799 --> 02:12:45.860
Sir, we're running out.
We don't have much left to shoot with.

02:12:45.970 --> 02:12:47.528
Some boys got nothing at all.

02:12:47.771 --> 02:12:49.500
What do we do for ammunition?

02:12:49.573 --> 02:12:52.440
My boys had to pick up reb muskets
and fired back with them.

02:12:52.509 --> 02:12:54.875
- We ought to pull out.
- No, we can't do that.

02:12:54.979 --> 02:12:56.708
We can't hold them again, sir.

02:12:56.780 --> 02:12:59.874
If we don't, they go right over the hill
and the flank caves in.

02:13:05.122 --> 02:13:06.214
Here they come.

02:13:11.128 --> 02:13:13.722
We can't run away.
If we stay here, we can't shoot.

02:13:13.797 --> 02:13:15.162
So let's fix bayonets.

02:13:19.103 --> 02:13:21.367
We'll have the advantage
moving down the hill.

02:13:23.907 --> 02:13:26.774
They must be tired if we are.
So fix bayonets.

02:13:26.844 --> 02:13:29.312
Ellis, you take the left wing.
I'll take the right.

02:13:29.380 --> 02:13:31.348
Right wheel forward, the whole regiment.

02:13:31.415 --> 02:13:33.679
- You mean charge?
- Yes, but here's what we do.

02:13:33.784 --> 02:13:36.014
We're going to charge
swinging down the hill.

02:13:36.086 --> 02:13:38.316
Just like we pulled back to the left side...

02:13:38.455 --> 02:13:40.389
...we'll swing it down like a door.

02:13:40.791 --> 02:13:44.192
We'll sweep them down the hill
as they come up. Understand?

02:13:44.261 --> 02:13:46.388
- Does everybody understand?
- Yes, sir.

02:13:46.463 --> 02:13:48.226
Ellis, take the left wing.

02:13:48.299 --> 02:13:52.030
When I command, the whole regiment
will go forward swinging down to the right.

02:13:52.569 --> 02:13:54.161
All right, sir. Fine.

02:13:56.573 --> 02:13:57.665
Move.

02:14:00.778 --> 02:14:02.177
Bayonets!

02:14:27.304 --> 02:14:29.932
Come on! Let's go! Move!

02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:31.701
Quickly, boys! Quickly!

02:14:40.751 --> 02:14:42.082
Let's go!

02:14:44.655 --> 02:14:45.986
Bayonets!

02:14:54.565 --> 02:14:55.554
Draw!

02:14:57.067 --> 02:14:58.193
Bayonets!

02:15:01.004 --> 02:15:02.403
Left swing, right wheel.

02:15:02.673 --> 02:15:03.901
Right wheel!

02:15:05.275 --> 02:15:06.071
Charge!

02:15:09.780 --> 02:15:11.008
Charge!

02:15:29.433 --> 02:15:30.661
Go!

02:16:46.677 --> 02:16:47.540
The pistol.

02:16:49.012 --> 02:16:50.343
Your prisoner, sir.

02:16:53.884 --> 02:16:54.714
Wait here.

02:17:20.677 --> 02:17:24.077
By God, Colonel,
the boys are still advancing.

02:17:24.514 --> 02:17:27.313
- You better stop them.
- They're on their way to Richmond.

02:17:27.484 --> 02:17:30.009
- Richmond!
- They've done enough for today.

02:17:30.486 --> 02:17:32.717
I want you to meet
this fellow from Alabama.

02:17:33.022 --> 02:17:35.924
Captain Hawkins, this is my brother,
Colonel Chamberlain.

02:17:37.628 --> 02:17:38.492
Sir.

02:17:39.763 --> 02:17:41.230
May I have some water?

02:17:41.598 --> 02:17:42.690
Yes.

02:17:44.300 --> 02:17:46.235
Sure. Tom, get this man a canteen.

02:17:46.637 --> 02:17:48.571
Yes, sir. Come this way.

02:18:08.859 --> 02:18:10.087
How you doing?

02:18:10.661 --> 02:18:11.388
Twice!

02:18:12.462 --> 02:18:14.896
Would you believe, for the love of Mary?

02:18:15.132 --> 02:18:16.099
Twice.

02:18:22.406 --> 02:18:26.068
And how are you, Colonel, darling,
this fine day?

02:18:28.477 --> 02:18:30.378
I got it in the armpit.

02:18:31.214 --> 02:18:34.047
For the love of God, in the bloody armpit.

02:18:34.951 --> 02:18:35.781
How is he?

02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:37.418
It's an arm.

02:18:37.654 --> 02:18:39.713
Only an arm. You got to lose something.

02:18:40.424 --> 02:18:41.948
It might as well be an arm.

02:18:42.025 --> 02:18:46.018
I can part with that easier than other
mechanics of nature, and that's the truth.

02:18:51.768 --> 02:18:53.463
I could do with a nip right now.

02:18:53.904 --> 02:18:55.531
I'll see what I can do.

02:18:56.340 --> 02:18:57.967
You do pretty good.

02:19:02.045 --> 02:19:04.138
Colonel <i>... </i>

02:19:04.848 --> 02:19:06.975
I'm right here, Buster. I'm right here.

02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:11.878
The army was blessed.

02:19:15.125 --> 02:19:19.391
I want to tell you, just in case...

02:19:22.264 --> 02:19:23.732
...that I never served <i>... </i>

02:19:29.573 --> 02:19:31.598
I've never served with a better man.

02:19:38.348 --> 02:19:39.679
Don't worry, sir.

02:19:40.217 --> 02:19:42.343
He'll make it. He's a tough old mick.

02:20:18.388 --> 02:20:21.619
Colonel, sir. It would so honor me.

02:20:32.269 --> 02:20:36.228
Colonel, sir. I've been moving these rebs
with an empty musket.

02:20:37.474 --> 02:20:38.998
That's allowed.

02:20:44.981 --> 02:20:47.347
You're ordered to go to the top
of the big hill.

02:20:47.584 --> 02:20:50.485
- My New Yorkers will take your prisoners.
- Yes, sir.

02:20:51.121 --> 02:20:52.952
We watched from our position above.

02:20:53.523 --> 02:20:55.718
It's the damnedest thing I ever saw.

02:20:57.260 --> 02:20:58.750
May I shake your hand, sir?

02:21:01.865 --> 02:21:06.359
Colonel, one thing.
The name of this place, this hill <i>... </i>

02:21:07.270 --> 02:21:08.828
Has it got a name, this hill?

02:21:09.339 --> 02:21:13.002
This is Little Round Top.
That's the name of the hill you defended.

02:21:13.076 --> 02:21:16.273
The big one you're going up to,
that's Big Round Top.

02:21:17.814 --> 02:21:20.942
Is that so? I guess I'll remember that.

02:21:31.228 --> 02:21:34.629
Ellis, move the men out.
I'm going to go ahead.

02:22:48.366 --> 02:22:49.424
Sam?

02:22:50.368 --> 02:22:52.131
We drugged him, sir.

02:22:52.437 --> 02:22:54.530
It'd be better if he slept.

02:22:55.773 --> 02:22:57.570
Didn't see much.

02:22:58.409 --> 02:23:01.071
The boys went in. Hit the rocks.

02:23:04.649 --> 02:23:06.310
How did it go, Pete?

02:23:08.786 --> 02:23:10.117
Fine, Sam.

02:23:10.755 --> 02:23:12.518
We take those rocks?

02:23:13.624 --> 02:23:15.023
Most of them.

02:23:15.193 --> 02:23:16.820
Worst...

02:23:17.428 --> 02:23:19.988
...ground I ever saw.

02:23:20.465 --> 02:23:21.955
You know that?

02:23:24.135 --> 02:23:25.693
They call it...

02:23:26.371 --> 02:23:29.101
...Devil's Den. It's a good name for it.

02:23:35.947 --> 02:23:37.039
What casualties?

02:23:37.949 --> 02:23:38.973
Don't know yet.

02:23:40.952 --> 02:23:42.510
Got to give my boys credit.

02:23:47.091 --> 02:23:51.027
You should've let me go to the right.

02:23:52.864 --> 02:23:56.664
We should've gone to the right.

02:23:57.735 --> 02:23:59.600
He needs to rest some.

02:25:01.399 --> 02:25:03.196
You summoned me, sir?

02:25:05.136 --> 02:25:06.433
Harrison.

02:25:08.806 --> 02:25:10.330
I did.

02:25:13.511 --> 02:25:15.069
I've got some night work.

02:25:15.179 --> 02:25:16.305
Are you up to it?

02:25:16.614 --> 02:25:19.447
"All the world will be in love with night...

02:25:19.817 --> 02:25:22.547
"And pay no worship to the garish sun."

02:25:24.055 --> 02:25:28.014
When this is all over,
I do look forward to seeing you on stage.

02:25:30.094 --> 02:25:32.119
What are the general's wishes?

02:25:39.570 --> 02:25:43.006
I want you to go out on the right,
scout the federal position.

02:25:43.074 --> 02:25:46.601
Their condition, what they've got
in reserve, what they're bringing up.

02:25:46.677 --> 02:25:49.612
It'll probably take all night.
But I want it right and clear.

02:25:49.780 --> 02:25:52.214
- Your obedient servant, General.
- Good.

02:25:52.450 --> 02:25:56.318
Now, Harrison, it'll be dangerous.
And I do appreciate this.

02:25:57.455 --> 02:25:58.888
Thank you, sir.

02:26:00.124 --> 02:26:03.150
But I must confess,
the thing that bothers me about this job...

02:26:03.227 --> 02:26:05.058
...is the absence of an audience.

02:26:05.329 --> 02:26:07.297
When you do it right, no one knows it.

02:26:07.365 --> 02:26:09.492
Nobody ever watches your work.
Do you see?

02:26:10.935 --> 02:26:12.800
That's very hard on an actor.

02:26:18.676 --> 02:26:19.665
Go on.

02:26:41.132 --> 02:26:43.430
General, I'm very glad to see you well.

02:26:43.501 --> 02:26:46.402
I've just come by for my orders, sir.

02:26:53.611 --> 02:26:56.045
It would appear
that General Stuart has returned.

02:26:58.249 --> 02:26:59.716
The prodigal son.

02:27:28.512 --> 02:27:31.037
It was very close this afternoon.

02:27:35.419 --> 02:27:36.317
Sir?

02:27:36.787 --> 02:27:38.152
They nearly broke.

02:27:39.190 --> 02:27:40.953
I could feel them breaking.

02:27:42.093 --> 02:27:45.790
There for a moment I thought I saw
our flags go up the hill.

02:27:54.872 --> 02:27:56.100
It wasn't that close.

02:27:57.341 --> 02:28:00.742
The attacks were not properly coordinated.
I do not know why.

02:28:01.479 --> 02:28:03.709
And nevertheless, we nearly won the day.

02:28:05.082 --> 02:28:08.347
I could see a clear road
all the way to Washington.

02:28:13.824 --> 02:28:15.416
How is it with General Hood?

02:28:17.795 --> 02:28:20.263
I think he'll live. May lose an arm.

02:28:20.698 --> 02:28:21.790
Dear God.

02:28:22.533 --> 02:28:24.763
I couldn't spare General Hood.

02:28:26.437 --> 02:28:29.304
So many good men were lost this day.

02:28:31.108 --> 02:28:31.836
Sir?

02:28:33.744 --> 02:28:36.872
Lo did take the peach orchard
and wheat field.

02:28:37.248 --> 02:28:39.375
But he couldn't get up that ridge.

02:28:40.317 --> 02:28:44.981
And Hood, he seized the Devil's Den,
but he couldn't take the little rocky hill.

02:28:46.357 --> 02:28:49.485
The federals still hold the heights.
And they're reinforced.

02:28:50.828 --> 02:28:51.726
General?

02:28:53.297 --> 02:28:55.822
That way around to the right is still open.

02:29:03.240 --> 02:29:05.037
I will think on it, General.

02:29:05.676 --> 02:29:09.373
We have enough artillery
for one more good fight, but just one.

02:29:09.547 --> 02:29:10.741
I know.

02:29:10.948 --> 02:29:12.415
Let me think on it.

02:29:12.850 --> 02:29:15.250
- General...
- I am very glad to see you well.

02:29:15.653 --> 02:29:17.484
We will speak again in the morning.

02:29:39.610 --> 02:29:42.272
You know, hearing you talk
about monkeys and trees...

02:29:42.346 --> 02:29:45.179
...I remember the time
during a cannonade on the peninsula.

02:29:45.249 --> 02:29:47.843
There was one tree
for the men to hide behind.

02:29:47.918 --> 02:29:51.752
It was a skinny little tree
and the boys, they fell behind it...

02:29:51.822 --> 02:29:55.223
...in a long thin line
which ruled just like a pigtail.

02:29:55.292 --> 02:29:57.260
It swayed to one side, then the other.

02:29:57.361 --> 02:29:59.727
A shell came this way,
the line swayed that way.

02:29:59.797 --> 02:30:02.425
A cannonball came that way,
the line swayed this way.

02:30:02.500 --> 02:30:03.831
It was a thing to see.

02:30:03.901 --> 02:30:07.268
George, what has that got to do
with what we're talking about?

02:30:13.444 --> 02:30:14.411
General.

02:30:17.114 --> 02:30:20.015
Carry on, gentlemen.
Don't let me interrupt the revival.

02:30:20.351 --> 02:30:22.080
General, you're just in time.

02:30:23.187 --> 02:30:27.556
I've been trying to persuade George here
of the modern, scientific...

02:30:27.625 --> 02:30:30.287
...theories of Charles Darwin.
The theory of evolution.

02:30:30.361 --> 02:30:33.455
The notion that all mankind
is descended from the ape.

02:30:34.198 --> 02:30:36.063
He does not subscribe.

02:30:36.167 --> 02:30:37.566
- Is that so?
- I do not.

02:30:37.635 --> 02:30:41.594
I've ordered General Armistead to stop
filling his head with heathen blasphemies.

02:30:41.705 --> 02:30:44.572
Now, you are to devote
your reflective moments to study...

02:30:44.642 --> 02:30:46.906
...in the matters of military significance.

02:30:47.077 --> 02:30:47.941
Ordered me.

02:30:48.512 --> 02:30:52.209
Or perhaps appropriating
some more of this fine whiskey here.

02:30:52.316 --> 02:30:53.283
Absolutely.

02:30:53.684 --> 02:30:55.584
- Would you care for?
- No, thank you.

02:30:55.653 --> 02:30:58.850
Surely the commanding general
shares my deep feelings of disgust...

02:30:58.956 --> 02:31:00.856
...at this simian suggestion.

02:31:03.060 --> 02:31:06.894
I suppose there's some pretty smart folk
that take Darwin for the Gospel.

02:31:07.698 --> 02:31:12.465
They would not be invited to join
George's ever-shrinking circle of friends.

02:31:12.536 --> 02:31:14.367
General Longstreet, sir.

02:31:14.605 --> 02:31:18.132
I intend to lay this matter to rest
for once and for all time.

02:31:18.375 --> 02:31:19.307
Good.

02:31:25.049 --> 02:31:29.315
Perhaps there are those among you who do
think that you are descended from an ape.

02:31:31.155 --> 02:31:33.521
I suppose it's possible
there are those of you...

02:31:33.591 --> 02:31:36.219
...who believe that I'm descended
from an ape, but...

02:31:36.293 --> 02:31:38.591
...I challenge the man to step forward...

02:31:39.563 --> 02:31:42.589
...who believes that General Lee
is descended from an ape.

02:31:42.833 --> 02:31:44.232
- Here, here.
- Not likely.

02:31:45.502 --> 02:31:50.201
All science trembles before
the searing logic of your fiery intellect.

02:32:01.085 --> 02:32:04.577
So, exactly how many of your relatives
are there that are apes?

02:32:14.765 --> 02:32:17.233
What do you hear about Sam Hood?

02:32:17.668 --> 02:32:19.226
He may lose an arm.

02:32:20.804 --> 02:32:23.705
Dick Garnett isn't fit. Can't hardly walk.

02:32:24.275 --> 02:32:27.836
Thing is, if there's a fight,
he can't stand to stay out of it.

02:32:28.412 --> 02:32:30.437
But if you ordered him to stay out <i>... </i>

02:32:34.218 --> 02:32:36.345
I don't suppose you could do that.

02:32:37.354 --> 02:32:43.054
<i>"The gleam of morning</i>

02:32:43.160 --> 02:32:47.859
<i>"The day's dawn is breaking</i>

02:32:50.034 --> 02:32:54.698
<i>"The horn of the hunter</i>

02:32:55.739 --> 02:33:00.506
<i>"Is heard on the heath</i>

02:33:02.613 --> 02:33:07.277
<i>"The lark from the light..."</i>

02:33:07.584 --> 02:33:09.074
That boy can sing.

02:33:10.521 --> 02:33:12.682
That's Captain Mavournee.

02:33:18.996 --> 02:33:21.294
What do you hear about Hancock?

02:33:22.132 --> 02:33:23.565
Ran into him today.

02:33:25.903 --> 02:33:27.803
He's out there about a mile or so.

02:33:28.238 --> 02:33:32.299
Just a mile or so. And he was tough.

02:33:32.977 --> 02:33:34.308
Very tough today.

02:33:34.712 --> 02:33:36.612
He's the best they got.

02:33:37.014 --> 02:33:39.482
God don't make them any better.
And that's a fact.

02:33:44.855 --> 02:33:47.585
I'd like to go over to see him
as soon as I can.

02:33:50.494 --> 02:33:52.587
The last time I saw Winn...

02:33:54.832 --> 02:33:58.063
...he played that song. That very song.

02:33:59.770 --> 02:34:03.228
Back in California,
we were all together for the last time.

02:34:04.074 --> 02:34:05.769
Before we broke up.

02:34:06.744 --> 02:34:08.541
Spring of 1861.

02:34:15.953 --> 02:34:17.147
Myra Hancock.

02:34:17.721 --> 02:34:20.417
Do you remember Myra, Hancock's wife?

02:34:21.058 --> 02:34:22.491
Beautiful woman.

02:34:22.893 --> 02:34:25.919
Most perfect woman I ever saw.

02:34:28.565 --> 02:34:30.123
They were a beautiful couple.

02:34:31.969 --> 02:34:32.936
Beautiful.

02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:38.608
Garnett was with me that night.

02:34:40.677 --> 02:34:44.943
A lot of fellows from the old outfit.
People standing around singing...

02:34:45.349 --> 02:34:46.680
...in the blue uniform.

02:34:47.384 --> 02:34:50.148
We were leaving the next day.

02:34:51.121 --> 02:34:53.817
Some going north. Some going south.

02:34:55.759 --> 02:34:57.056
Splitting up.

02:35:00.264 --> 02:35:01.891
A soldier's farewell.

02:35:02.800 --> 02:35:04.791
"Goodbye. Good luck.

02:35:05.803 --> 02:35:07.395
"I'll see you in hell."

02:35:08.839 --> 02:35:10.397
Do you remember that?

02:35:18.382 --> 02:35:20.441
Towards the end of the evening...

02:35:21.652 --> 02:35:23.950
...we all sat around the piano.

02:35:25.489 --> 02:35:27.684
And Myra played...

02:35:28.926 --> 02:35:31.918
...that song there,
that was the one she played.

02:35:34.865 --> 02:35:37.834
Maybe for years, maybe forever...

02:35:40.871 --> 02:35:42.361
...l'll never forget that.

02:35:48.378 --> 02:35:50.243
You know how it was, Pete.

02:35:59.022 --> 02:36:00.751
Winn was like a brother to me.

02:36:01.091 --> 02:36:02.115
Remember?

02:36:04.394 --> 02:36:06.294
Towards the end of the evening...

02:36:09.199 --> 02:36:10.791
...things got a little rough.

02:36:11.301 --> 02:36:13.462
We all began to <i>... </i>

02:36:18.475 --> 02:36:20.500
There were a lot of tears.

02:36:24.148 --> 02:36:25.740
I went over to Hancock.

02:36:27.351 --> 02:36:29.410
I took him by the shoulder. I said:

02:36:32.723 --> 02:36:34.122
"So help me...

02:36:35.459 --> 02:36:38.087
"...if I ever raise my hand against you...

02:36:38.996 --> 02:36:40.486
"...may God strike me dead."

02:36:49.106 --> 02:36:50.835
I haven't seen him since.

02:36:52.109 --> 02:36:54.077
He was at Malverne Hill...

02:36:54.478 --> 02:36:58.471
...White Oak Swamp,
Sharpsburg, Fredericksburg.

02:37:03.187 --> 02:37:06.714
One of these days,
I will see him, I'm afraid.

02:37:07.991 --> 02:37:09.549
Across that...

02:37:10.694 --> 02:37:13.424
...small deadly space.

02:37:22.072 --> 02:37:25.439
I thought about sitting this one out.

02:37:25.776 --> 02:37:27.368
But I can't do that.

02:37:29.079 --> 02:37:31.138
That wouldn't be right either.

02:37:38.088 --> 02:37:38.986
I guess not.

02:37:44.528 --> 02:37:45.995
Thank you, Peter.

02:37:50.500 --> 02:37:52.331
I had to talk about that.

02:37:59.910 --> 02:38:02.845
I'm sending Myra Hancock...

02:38:04.314 --> 02:38:07.306
...a small package to be opened...

02:38:08.252 --> 02:38:10.083
...in the event of my death.

02:38:15.492 --> 02:38:17.050
You'll drop by and see her...

02:38:17.661 --> 02:38:19.253
...after this is over.

02:38:19.930 --> 02:38:21.329
Won't you, Pete?

02:38:30.440 --> 02:38:31.600
Thank you.

02:38:35.212 --> 02:38:36.907
What day is it now, Major?

02:38:40.217 --> 02:38:42.185
It's long after midnight, sir.

02:38:42.386 --> 02:38:43.751
It's already Friday.

02:38:43.987 --> 02:38:46.478
- Friday, July 3?
- Yes, sir.

02:38:47.624 --> 02:38:49.751
Then tomorrow is the Fourth of July.

02:38:51.094 --> 02:38:52.561
Independence Day.

02:38:55.799 --> 02:38:59.166
- I'd quite forgotten.
- The good Lord has a sense of humor.

02:38:59.770 --> 02:39:02.068
I'm very sorry to keep you up so late.

02:39:02.139 --> 02:39:03.538
It is my pleasure.

02:39:03.674 --> 02:39:05.642
We should have a larger staff.

02:39:06.243 --> 02:39:08.040
I'd be offended, sir.

02:39:08.845 --> 02:39:10.335
I can do the work.

02:39:10.414 --> 02:39:11.574
Very well.

02:39:14.017 --> 02:39:16.679
General Stuart is waiting to see you, sir.

02:39:17.554 --> 02:39:20.546
- Shall I bring him in?
- Of course.

02:39:23.560 --> 02:39:25.323
- Major?
- Yes, sir.

02:39:25.696 --> 02:39:28.529
General Stuart and I
must not be disturbed.

02:39:29.833 --> 02:39:31.801
- Very well, sir.
- Thank you.

02:39:35.372 --> 02:39:37.806
General Lee will see you now, sir.

02:39:49.586 --> 02:39:50.985
You wish to see me, sir.

02:39:56.226 --> 02:40:01.755
It is the opinion of some excellent officers
that you have let us all down.

02:40:02.699 --> 02:40:05.532
Sir, if you will please tell me
who these gentlemen are?

02:40:05.602 --> 02:40:07.832
There will be none of that.
There is no time.

02:40:07.904 --> 02:40:09.963
I ask that I be allowed to defend my...

02:40:10.040 --> 02:40:11.473
There is no time.

02:40:13.310 --> 02:40:14.402
General Stuart.

02:40:17.447 --> 02:40:20.974
Your mission was to free this army...

02:40:21.518 --> 02:40:23.247
...from the enemy cavalry.

02:40:23.320 --> 02:40:26.756
And to report any movement
by the enemy's main body.

02:40:26.990 --> 02:40:28.685
That mission was not fulfilled.

02:40:29.259 --> 02:40:30.886
You left here...

02:40:31.027 --> 02:40:34.929
...with no word of your movement
or movement of the enemy for days.

02:40:35.165 --> 02:40:37.633
While we were engaged
and drawn into battle...

02:40:37.868 --> 02:40:41.429
...without adequate knowledge
of the enemy's strength or position.

02:40:41.505 --> 02:40:43.200
Without knowledge of the ground.

02:40:43.373 --> 02:40:47.173
So it is only by God's grace
that we did not meet disaster here.

02:40:47.811 --> 02:40:49.506
General Lee, there were reasons.

02:40:49.679 --> 02:40:52.648
Perhaps you misunderstood my orders.

02:40:53.717 --> 02:40:56.242
Perhaps I did not make myself clear.

02:40:56.920 --> 02:41:00.788
Well, sir, this must be made very clear.

02:41:01.658 --> 02:41:03.023
You, sir...

02:41:03.260 --> 02:41:06.388
...with your cavalry,
are the eyes of this army.

02:41:07.130 --> 02:41:09.826
Without your cavalry, we are made blind.

02:41:10.167 --> 02:41:12.260
That has already happened once.

02:41:12.402 --> 02:41:15.894
It must never, never happen again.

02:41:24.915 --> 02:41:28.851
- Since I no longer hold the General's...
- I told you there is no time for that!

02:41:28.985 --> 02:41:30.077
There is no time.

02:41:46.903 --> 02:41:50.202
There is another fight coming tomorrow
and we need you.

02:41:50.273 --> 02:41:52.503
We need every man. God knows.

02:41:55.312 --> 02:41:57.712
You must take what I have told you...

02:41:58.482 --> 02:42:01.542
...and learn from it as a man does.

02:42:03.119 --> 02:42:04.677
There has been a mistake.

02:42:04.754 --> 02:42:07.723
It will not happen again.
I know your quality.

02:42:08.124 --> 02:42:11.355
You are one of the finest
cavalry officers I have ever known...

02:42:11.528 --> 02:42:15.020
...and your service to this army
has been invaluable.

02:42:21.238 --> 02:42:23.433
Let us speak no more of this.

02:42:32.249 --> 02:42:35.412
The matter is concluded.
Goodnight, General.

02:43:15.926 --> 02:43:17.393
Colonel, sir.

02:43:21.531 --> 02:43:23.396
What are you doing up here?

02:43:24.100 --> 02:43:26.068
I'm just resting my leg.

02:43:30.707 --> 02:43:32.038
All right.

02:43:34.644 --> 02:43:36.612
You sure can see a ways from here.

02:43:38.748 --> 02:43:40.409
Quite a bit.

02:43:41.084 --> 02:43:42.676
We sent out a detail...

02:43:42.986 --> 02:43:45.454
...and found some more departed souls
down there...

02:43:45.522 --> 02:43:48.753
...and they were carrying coffee
for which they had no more use for.

02:43:48.825 --> 02:43:49.849
You're a ghoul.

02:43:55.065 --> 02:43:57.192
You did real good yesterday.

02:43:58.468 --> 02:44:00.800
The way them rebs just kept coming.

02:44:02.472 --> 02:44:04.337
You had to admire them.

02:44:06.343 --> 02:44:08.174
You think they'll come again today?

02:44:09.346 --> 02:44:11.974
It don't look like they're planning to leave.

02:44:13.083 --> 02:44:14.607
We don't have but 100 men.

02:44:14.851 --> 02:44:17.445
Even with the whole flock
from the Second Maine.

02:44:17.754 --> 02:44:19.415
This position's good.

02:44:25.328 --> 02:44:26.488
Diversion.

02:44:28.765 --> 02:44:30.426
Go alert the pickets.

02:44:30.500 --> 02:44:33.333
That may be a diversion.
They may be coming this way again.

02:44:33.570 --> 02:44:35.470
Where's the ammunition I asked for?

02:44:35.538 --> 02:44:38.405
Go check the hospital, see about the boys.
Check on Buster.

02:44:38.475 --> 02:44:40.033
Very well, sir.

02:44:40.210 --> 02:44:41.802
We need another runner.

02:44:41.878 --> 02:44:45.780
I keep going up and down this hill,
my legs are going to fall off.

02:44:51.488 --> 02:44:53.649
- Good morning, General.
- Good morning, sir.

02:44:53.723 --> 02:44:56.556
- Ride with me, if you will.
- Yes, sir.

02:45:26.623 --> 02:45:29.820
General Longstreet, you have
General Pickett now and he is fresh.

02:45:30.326 --> 02:45:32.590
I want you to bring your corps forward.

02:45:32.829 --> 02:45:36.663
Take those heights in the center
and split the federal line.

02:45:44.641 --> 02:45:47.405
My two divisions, Hood's and McLaws'<i>... </i>

02:45:47.911 --> 02:45:51.745
They executed a forced march yesterday
and went straight into the fight.

02:45:51.981 --> 02:45:53.778
Lost half of their strength.

02:45:54.651 --> 02:45:56.881
Sustained 50 percent casualties, sir.

02:45:57.020 --> 02:45:59.215
They are tired and need rest.

02:46:01.191 --> 02:46:02.385
There are...

02:46:03.093 --> 02:46:06.824
...now three federal corps on those two
rocky hills on our right flank.

02:46:06.896 --> 02:46:09.262
If I move all my people forward...

02:46:09.499 --> 02:46:11.899
...we won't have a flank at all.

02:46:12.035 --> 02:46:14.162
They'll simply swing around and crush us.

02:46:16.439 --> 02:46:19.203
They are well entrenched up there.
They aim to fight.

02:46:19.309 --> 02:46:22.107
They got good artillery and plenty of it.

02:46:22.579 --> 02:46:25.639
Sir, any attack we make
will be uphill over open ground.

02:46:26.850 --> 02:46:29.717
How do we communicate?
How do we coordinate attack?

02:46:30.353 --> 02:46:32.981
They're all massed together,
damned near in a circle.

02:46:33.156 --> 02:46:34.748
Good interior lines.

02:46:35.358 --> 02:46:38.521
Anywhere we hit them,
they'll bring up reinforcements in minutes.

02:46:39.262 --> 02:46:43.164
But we try to bring up support,
it has to come from miles away.

02:46:43.767 --> 02:46:45.530
Their cannon will see every move.

02:46:46.870 --> 02:46:49.930
Hell, their cannon are looking down
on us right now.

02:46:50.673 --> 02:46:52.538
In the center, they will break.

02:46:53.877 --> 02:46:55.777
They will break in the center.

02:46:55.845 --> 02:46:59.747
They'll be gaining men from all directions,
guns by the thousands...

02:46:59.816 --> 02:47:03.308
...and Richmond has nothing left
to send us. So, if we stay, we fight.

02:47:03.920 --> 02:47:07.447
If we retreat now,
we will have fought here for two days...

02:47:07.690 --> 02:47:10.386
...and will leave knowing
we could not drive him off.

02:47:11.227 --> 02:47:15.789
And I have never yet left the enemy
in command of the field. No, sir.

02:47:16.132 --> 02:47:18.100
Retreat is no longer an option.

02:47:19.269 --> 02:47:21.635
The enemy has been attacked
on both wings.

02:47:21.738 --> 02:47:23.205
He has reinforced there...

02:47:23.273 --> 02:47:26.504
...and is strongest there on the wings.
The hills and the rocks.

02:47:26.576 --> 02:47:28.441
So the weak point is in the center.

02:47:28.545 --> 02:47:30.604
They have command of the high ground.

02:47:30.680 --> 02:47:33.114
But in that long slope, you see there?

02:47:33.349 --> 02:47:37.183
The long slope in the center,
there's where he's most vulnerable.

02:47:37.620 --> 02:47:41.613
General Pickett's Virginians
are the only people not yet engaged. Yes?

02:47:43.293 --> 02:47:46.456
With General Longstreet in command,
my old warhorse...

02:47:46.729 --> 02:47:49.892
...meeting the enemy face to face
on ground of his choosing...

02:47:49.966 --> 02:47:52.127
...and with honor, we will prevail.

02:48:12.021 --> 02:48:14.421
Sir, a courier from Colonel Rice.

02:48:17.927 --> 02:48:19.189
Colonel Chamberlain.

02:48:22.665 --> 02:48:24.098
That's some climb, sir.

02:48:24.334 --> 02:48:26.029
My men need rations, Lieutenant.

02:48:26.469 --> 02:48:29.836
Colonel Rice has entrusted me to tell you
that you're relieved, sir.

02:48:31.441 --> 02:48:32.533
Relieved?

02:48:32.675 --> 02:48:36.111
Fresh troops are on their way up
and they'll take over here, sir.

02:48:36.779 --> 02:48:39.373
Colonel Rice wants to give
your people a rest.

02:48:39.649 --> 02:48:42.311
He wants you to fall back,
and I'm to show you the way.

02:48:42.385 --> 02:48:43.716
Fall back.

02:48:46.389 --> 02:48:48.653
Ellis, have the men fall in.
We're moving out.

02:48:48.725 --> 02:48:49.817
Yes, sir.

02:48:50.693 --> 02:48:51.853
Where are we going?

02:48:53.463 --> 02:48:54.691
Lovely spot.

02:48:54.964 --> 02:48:57.262
Very quiet. Safest place on the battlefield.

02:48:57.533 --> 02:48:59.433
Right smack-dab in the center.

02:49:44.547 --> 02:49:46.037
Yes, sir, General.

02:49:46.649 --> 02:49:48.048
We will attack the center.

02:49:48.851 --> 02:49:51.046
But I think you are right about the flank.

02:49:52.322 --> 02:49:55.621
Hood and McLaws were both very badly
damaged yesterday.

02:49:56.459 --> 02:50:00.919
What I'll do is give you two other divisions:
General Pettigrew and General Trimble.

02:50:00.997 --> 02:50:02.589
They are stronger and rested.

02:50:02.665 --> 02:50:06.863
Now, you will have nearly three divisions
at your command, including Pickett.

02:50:07.103 --> 02:50:10.129
Your objective will be
that clump of trees yonder.

02:50:12.709 --> 02:50:15.439
The attack will be preceded by
massed artillery.

02:50:15.645 --> 02:50:18.978
We'll concentrate all of our guns
on that one small area.

02:50:19.215 --> 02:50:22.013
A <i>feu d'enfer</i>, as Napoleon would call it.

02:50:22.685 --> 02:50:26.519
When the artillery has had its effect,
your charge will break the line.

02:50:26.589 --> 02:50:30.150
You will have nearly 15,000 men
at your command, General.

02:50:30.493 --> 02:50:32.586
You may begin whenever you're ready.

02:50:32.662 --> 02:50:35.495
But plan it well.
Do plan it well, I pray you, sir.

02:50:35.698 --> 02:50:37.598
We stake everything on this.

02:50:37.834 --> 02:50:39.631
With your permission.

02:50:44.374 --> 02:50:46.706
Sir, I've been a soldier all my life.

02:50:47.010 --> 02:50:50.104
I have served from the ranks on up.
You know my service.

02:50:54.517 --> 02:50:58.078
I must tell you now,
I believe this attack will fail.

02:51:02.959 --> 02:51:06.622
No 15,000 men ever made
can take that ridge.

02:51:07.163 --> 02:51:09.859
It's a distance of more than a mile
over open ground.

02:51:09.932 --> 02:51:12.332
When the men come out the trees
they will be...

02:51:12.735 --> 02:51:15.932
...under fire of Yankee artillery
from all over the field.

02:51:16.005 --> 02:51:17.438
Those are Hancock's boys.

02:51:17.907 --> 02:51:21.900
And now they have the stone wall
like we did at Fredericksburg.

02:51:22.745 --> 02:51:24.713
We do our duty, General.

02:51:25.515 --> 02:51:27.506
We do what we must do.

02:51:28.584 --> 02:51:29.573
Yes, sir.

02:51:31.554 --> 02:51:35.320
Colonel Alexander is in charge
of the artillery and he is very good.

02:51:36.559 --> 02:51:41.053
We will depend on him to drive them off
the ridge before your divisions get there.

02:51:41.531 --> 02:51:44.591
And the men will know what to do.
All 15,000...

02:51:44.667 --> 02:51:48.660
...will concentrate squarely on the center
of that line. That lower ridge there.

02:51:48.871 --> 02:51:51.066
The line is not strong there.

02:51:51.307 --> 02:51:54.401
General Meade has great strength
on both flanks.

02:51:54.844 --> 02:51:56.835
He must be weak in the center.

02:51:56.913 --> 02:52:00.974
I estimate his strength in the center
not to be more than 5,000 men.

02:52:01.250 --> 02:52:05.516
And Colonel Alexander's artillery
will break them up like at Fredericksburg.

02:52:06.022 --> 02:52:07.785
- Yes, sir.
- Farewell.

02:52:16.165 --> 02:52:17.826
What are you thinking, General?

02:52:23.272 --> 02:52:25.467
Pickett's division is from my corps.

02:52:25.541 --> 02:52:28.533
But the other two units
are of A.P. Hill's corps.

02:52:32.949 --> 02:52:34.974
Shouldn't General Hill lead the attack?

02:52:36.352 --> 02:52:37.250
Say again?

02:52:39.455 --> 02:52:41.980
Shouldn't General Hill lead the attack?

02:52:51.300 --> 02:52:52.460
My apologies, sir.

02:52:57.306 --> 02:52:59.740
I've always been very cautious, sir.

02:53:00.176 --> 02:53:01.438
Very cautious.

02:53:01.511 --> 02:53:03.445
There is no one I trust more.

02:53:11.187 --> 02:53:13.485
If we can take that ridge <i>... </i>

02:53:13.723 --> 02:53:16.055
We can. And we will.

02:53:23.299 --> 02:53:26.132
General, God go with you.

02:53:46.756 --> 02:53:48.656
George, you are leading attack.

02:53:48.724 --> 02:53:50.123
Now get ready, George.

02:53:50.293 --> 02:53:53.558
Take your men behind the line of trees.
I'll give you details later.

02:53:53.629 --> 02:53:55.290
Now, move, George!

02:57:00.049 --> 02:57:04.418
Forgive me the torn trousers, sir.
An officer riding around like this.

02:57:04.954 --> 02:57:06.444
Colonel Alexander.

02:57:07.123 --> 02:57:11.321
Those federal cannon up on that
little rocky hill can cause some trouble.

02:57:11.694 --> 02:57:14.857
I want you to assign some guns
and keep them silent.

02:57:14.930 --> 02:57:15.726
Then...

02:57:15.798 --> 02:57:18.562
...you move forward
when the infantry advance...

02:57:18.634 --> 02:57:20.295
...keeping the flanks clear.

02:57:20.503 --> 02:57:22.095
Porter, how old are you, son?

02:57:22.238 --> 02:57:23.569
Sir, I'm 28, sir.

02:57:26.242 --> 02:57:30.576
Well, Porter, we must also clear those guns
off that low center ridge right there.

02:57:30.679 --> 02:57:33.011
- That is the main thing.
- Yes, sir.

02:57:33.149 --> 02:57:36.482
- I'm relying on you, son.
- Yes, sir. I'll sure keep them shooting.

02:57:36.552 --> 02:57:37.780
Good.

02:57:38.888 --> 02:57:40.856
I want you to use everything you have.

02:57:40.923 --> 02:57:43.357
Maximum effort.
Fire all long-range ordinance.

02:57:43.426 --> 02:57:46.691
But don't open up till I give the word
and everything's in position.

02:57:47.129 --> 02:57:50.621
Then fire with all you've got.
I don't want to see a single gun silent.

02:57:50.866 --> 02:57:53.198
Find an observation point
and check the damage.

02:57:53.302 --> 02:57:55.532
We must clear those people off that ridge.

02:57:57.807 --> 02:57:59.172
If we don't <i>... </i>

02:57:59.608 --> 02:58:03.100
Anyway, you let me know when
you're nearing the end of your ammunition.

02:58:03.345 --> 02:58:07.008
We must conserve enough to support
the infantry attack. Is that clear?

02:58:07.249 --> 02:58:08.273
Yes, sir.

02:58:49.425 --> 02:58:52.258
Johnston Pettigrew,
University of North Carolina.

02:58:53.395 --> 02:58:54.589
Yeah, I know.

02:58:55.164 --> 02:58:58.258
They still talk about your grades there
with reverence and awe.

02:58:58.334 --> 02:59:01.599
Your reputation as a scholar
has preceded you, sir.

02:59:01.837 --> 02:59:03.498
I hear you've written a book.

02:59:03.572 --> 02:59:06.700
It was only a minor work.
If the general would care to read it <i>... </i>

02:59:07.309 --> 02:59:10.176
- Surely.
- Take a copy with my compliments.

02:59:10.246 --> 02:59:12.714
Captain, retrieve my book
from the baggage.

02:59:12.781 --> 02:59:16.740
General, my apologies, but I do not believe
I will have time to read that today.

02:59:18.921 --> 02:59:20.081
Gentlemen.

02:59:21.557 --> 02:59:24.424
I want you to look
at that clump of trees on that ridge.

02:59:26.028 --> 02:59:28.997
That is where all units will converge.

02:59:29.832 --> 02:59:34.531
You will be spread out in a long line,
perhaps a mile, about 15,000 men.

02:59:34.970 --> 02:59:38.462
All units converging on that point
on the crest of that ridge.

02:59:39.108 --> 02:59:40.632
Now, look here.

02:59:46.081 --> 02:59:48.413
The Yankee center. A stone wall.

02:59:50.986 --> 02:59:52.578
A small grove of trees.

02:59:54.423 --> 02:59:58.086
General Trimble, commanding
Pender's division, will be on the left.

02:59:59.528 --> 03:00:01.655
Pettigrew's brigade in support.

03:00:03.265 --> 03:00:06.564
General Pickett's division
will be on the right side of the attack.

03:00:06.902 --> 03:00:10.804
And now, George,
I want you to put two brigades in front...

03:00:11.040 --> 03:00:12.974
...and one in back, like so.

03:00:13.542 --> 03:00:14.509
Yes, sir.

03:00:15.878 --> 03:00:17.175
Garnett's brigade.

03:00:17.313 --> 03:00:18.837
That's Jimmy Kemper.

03:00:19.214 --> 03:00:21.011
Armistead's in support.

03:00:21.951 --> 03:00:23.578
Good. All right, then.

03:00:23.752 --> 03:00:25.913
Garnett will dress off at Trimble's flank.

03:00:25.988 --> 03:00:29.424
And he will be the hinge, so to speak,
in a series of left obliques.

03:00:30.359 --> 03:00:32.520
Somewhere about the Emmitsburgh Road...

03:00:32.661 --> 03:00:35.494
...you will execute your first left oblique.

03:00:36.031 --> 03:00:37.259
Then direct.

03:00:37.566 --> 03:00:38.794
Then left again.

03:00:39.101 --> 03:00:41.228
And so on at your own discretion...

03:00:41.470 --> 03:00:45.736
...in order to deceive the Yankees
and spread them out in a long line.

03:00:46.075 --> 03:00:47.508
Here. Any questions?

03:00:49.678 --> 03:00:51.202
All right, gentlemen.

03:00:56.585 --> 03:00:59.713
That is the conversion point.
That clump of trees.

03:01:00.289 --> 03:01:02.382
We will use all of the artillery.

03:01:03.392 --> 03:01:06.725
And it will center on the point, right there.

03:01:07.730 --> 03:01:11.097
We'll fire every gun they have
until the ammunition runs out.

03:01:12.167 --> 03:01:15.728
When that is done,
I will give the order and you all go in.

03:01:25.347 --> 03:01:29.306
I do believe this attack will decide
the fate of our country.

03:01:30.986 --> 03:01:36.424
All the men who have died in the past
are with you here today.

03:01:47.136 --> 03:01:52.369
I want to say, sir, it is an honor to serve
under your command.

03:02:00.983 --> 03:02:04.544
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me
the opportunity of serving here.

03:02:04.620 --> 03:02:07.214
I have prayed, sir.

03:02:43.792 --> 03:02:45.259
Can you take that ridge?

03:03:08.650 --> 03:03:09.412
Harrison.

03:03:10.052 --> 03:03:13.112
Would you mind giving someone an order
to give me a musket?

03:03:13.188 --> 03:03:15.349
I think today I'd like to join the attack.

03:03:15.691 --> 03:03:19.889
If I could even borrow a hat from a soldier
or just a jacket with some stripes on it.

03:03:21.463 --> 03:03:22.794
Sir, just once.

03:03:23.332 --> 03:03:26.529
Because, I think, sir,
today might be the last day.

03:03:31.039 --> 03:03:32.734
Haven't I earned it, sir?

03:03:36.678 --> 03:03:38.407
You know what's going to happen?

03:03:44.219 --> 03:03:46.210
I tell you what's going to happen.

03:03:48.157 --> 03:03:50.887
Troops are now forming
behind the line of trees.

03:03:52.060 --> 03:03:57.828
When they come out, they will be under
enemy long-range artillery fire.

03:03:58.500 --> 03:04:01.697
Solid shot. Percussion.
Every gun they have.

03:04:03.872 --> 03:04:06.864
Troops will come out under fire
with more than a mile to walk.

03:04:07.342 --> 03:04:09.435
And still, within the open field...

03:04:10.012 --> 03:04:12.139
...among the range of aimed muskets.

03:04:25.928 --> 03:04:28.920
They'll be slowed down
by that fence out there.

03:04:29.498 --> 03:04:33.400
And the formation, what's left of it,
will begin to come apart.

03:04:35.270 --> 03:04:39.172
When they cross that road,
they'll be under short-range artillery.

03:04:39.608 --> 03:04:41.098
Canister fire.

03:04:41.476 --> 03:04:45.071
Thousands of little bits of shrapnel
wiping the holes in the lines.

03:04:47.382 --> 03:04:49.942
If they get to that wall
without breaking up...

03:04:51.119 --> 03:04:52.780
...there won't be many left.

03:04:56.058 --> 03:04:57.855
A mathematical equation.

03:05:00.495 --> 03:05:03.589
But maybe, just maybe...

03:05:04.867 --> 03:05:07.358
...our own artillery will break up
their defenses.

03:05:08.670 --> 03:05:10.399
There's always that hope.

03:05:15.510 --> 03:05:18.604
That's Hancock out there.
And he isn't going to run.

03:05:21.550 --> 03:05:23.347
So it's mathematical after all.

03:05:24.920 --> 03:05:29.880
If they get to that road, or beyond it,
we'll suffer over 50 percent casualties.

03:05:35.230 --> 03:05:36.629
But, Harrison...

03:05:39.067 --> 03:05:42.002
...I don't believe my boys will reach
that wall.

03:05:53.649 --> 03:05:55.674
Sir, with your permission.

03:05:59.354 --> 03:06:01.754
I'll get myself that musket, sir.

03:06:13.201 --> 03:06:14.930
That's General Meade's headquarters.

03:06:16.171 --> 03:06:18.105
You're to take a position in reserve.

03:06:19.374 --> 03:06:22.639
You don't have to entrench,
but please don't go away.

03:06:22.711 --> 03:06:25.942
- Major Spear, do you have that?
- Yes, sir. I'll place the men.

03:06:26.014 --> 03:06:29.882
You, sir, are to report to General Hancock.
If you will follow me.

03:06:41.730 --> 03:06:44.790
General Hancock, sir.
Colonel Chamberlain, 20th Maine.

03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:46.024
Chamberlain.

03:06:46.101 --> 03:06:47.159
Yes.

03:06:47.469 --> 03:06:50.438
I hear from the ranks that
you may have been more involved...

03:06:50.505 --> 03:06:52.496
...than anyone in staff has told me.

03:06:52.574 --> 03:06:53.939
We were involved.

03:06:54.176 --> 03:06:56.667
They tell me you ordered a bayonet charge.

03:06:57.012 --> 03:06:59.412
It's nothing to be ashamed of,
I might tell you.

03:07:01.383 --> 03:07:02.850
I'm going to look into it.

03:07:03.051 --> 03:07:05.144
We need fighting men in this army.

03:07:05.320 --> 03:07:08.380
And one damn thing is sure,
we'll need some brigade commanders.

03:07:09.825 --> 03:07:11.884
Meanwhile, well done. Well done.

03:07:11.960 --> 03:07:13.427
Thank you, sir.

03:07:13.495 --> 03:07:14.928
How's your outfit?

03:07:15.430 --> 03:07:18.558
We need provisions.
The men need a meal. And ammunition.

03:07:18.667 --> 03:07:19.656
We're out.

03:07:20.068 --> 03:07:22.332
See to Colonel Chamberlain's request.

03:07:22.904 --> 03:07:24.667
I want you to write a report.

03:07:24.740 --> 03:07:25.832
Yes, sir.

03:07:29.444 --> 03:07:31.537
They say you are a school teacher.

03:07:32.214 --> 03:07:34.478
That seems like a long time ago.

03:07:34.549 --> 03:07:37.211
Sometimes I'm not sure
how long I've been in this war.

03:07:37.285 --> 03:07:39.583
Three years or three lifetimes.

03:07:39.988 --> 03:07:41.785
- What do you teach?
- Rhetoric...

03:07:42.024 --> 03:07:45.790
...and Natural and Revealed Religion.
At Bowdoin College, sir.

03:07:47.429 --> 03:07:49.226
Now you tell me, professor.

03:07:51.233 --> 03:07:53.929
Can you recall a story from antiquity
where two men...

03:07:54.002 --> 03:07:56.266
...who are best of friends,
almost brothers...

03:07:56.938 --> 03:07:59.805
...where these men find themselves,
by a trick of fate...

03:07:59.875 --> 03:08:02.343
...on opposing sides in a great war?

03:08:02.677 --> 03:08:04.907
Then, on a given day...

03:08:04.980 --> 03:08:08.245
...find themselves facing one another
on the very same battlefield.

03:08:10.819 --> 03:08:15.620
If the Greeks did not tell of such a story,
surely the Romans did.

03:08:17.359 --> 03:08:19.987
But, sir, I think it must be found
in the Bible.

03:08:20.462 --> 03:08:22.225
There isn't an officer on either side...

03:08:22.297 --> 03:08:25.789
...who hasn't know someone wearing
the other uniform. I know that.

03:08:26.501 --> 03:08:28.230
But this morning...

03:08:29.137 --> 03:08:31.731
...I looked through my glass
and saw the colors...

03:08:31.807 --> 03:08:35.538
...of the 9th and 14th Virginia regiments
on those ridges before us...

03:08:35.610 --> 03:08:37.703
...directly facing us, right over there.

03:08:38.280 --> 03:08:40.714
It was as if I could hear his voice.

03:08:41.616 --> 03:08:43.379
See his old crumpled hat.

03:08:45.120 --> 03:08:49.181
Armistead commands one of Pickett's
brigades and he's out there for sure.

03:08:51.326 --> 03:08:53.658
I somehow thought this day
would never come.

03:08:54.062 --> 03:08:56.360
I thought the war would be over
in a month.

03:08:56.431 --> 03:08:58.626
It's three years and how many more?

03:08:58.867 --> 03:09:01.700
Who could've dreamed
it could go on for so long?

03:09:04.773 --> 03:09:06.900
What would you do, Chamberlain?

03:09:08.810 --> 03:09:10.573
What do the books tell you to do?

03:09:14.483 --> 03:09:16.144
Now you go and rest up.

03:09:16.251 --> 03:09:18.446
Nothing's going to happen today anyway.

03:09:18.720 --> 03:09:22.349
Everybody's too tired, too hot,
too worn out. Both sides.

03:09:24.459 --> 03:09:26.950
We're placed in reserve, just over there.

03:09:27.028 --> 03:09:29.155
Thank you for your sentiments, sir.

03:10:01.530 --> 03:10:03.964
I just got back from the hospital.

03:10:05.200 --> 03:10:06.565
God-awful mess.

03:10:08.904 --> 03:10:10.269
They got no room.

03:10:11.239 --> 03:10:14.037
They got no shade.
They got men lying everywhere.

03:10:15.243 --> 03:10:18.337
They're cutting off arms and legs
in front of everybody.

03:10:21.183 --> 03:10:23.651
They ought to not do that in public.

03:10:25.820 --> 03:10:28.687
Men ought to have some privacy
at a time like that.

03:10:31.159 --> 03:10:32.251
You see Kilrain?

03:10:36.765 --> 03:10:37.857
How is he?

03:10:45.507 --> 03:10:46.496
He died.

03:10:53.415 --> 03:10:55.474
He died this morning before I got there.

03:10:58.253 --> 03:11:00.915
A couple of fellows were with him.

03:11:03.792 --> 03:11:05.851
He said to tell you goodbye.

03:11:07.929 --> 03:11:09.419
And that he was sorry.

03:11:21.676 --> 03:11:23.109
I tell you, Lawrence.

03:11:25.814 --> 03:11:27.611
I sure was fond of that man.

03:15:42.537 --> 03:15:45.404
General, please get down.
We cannot spare you.

03:15:45.740 --> 03:15:48.675
There are times when
a corps commander's life does not count.

03:17:05.587 --> 03:17:07.020
How are you, Lo?

03:17:09.824 --> 03:17:11.348
I'm fine, Dick.

03:17:14.829 --> 03:17:16.319
Well, that's good.

03:17:18.266 --> 03:17:19.756
How's the leg?

03:17:19.834 --> 03:17:21.267
It's all right.

03:17:22.537 --> 03:17:23.526
Can't walk.

03:17:23.738 --> 03:17:24.898
I'll have to ride.

03:17:24.973 --> 03:17:28.306
You can't do that.
You'll be the perfect target.

03:17:31.312 --> 03:17:34.577
We're going up there today
and we're going to break that line.

03:17:35.450 --> 03:17:40.285
When the Yankees run away, there'll be
an open road all the way to Washington.

03:17:43.157 --> 03:17:45.022
And maybe we'll win it today.

03:17:46.227 --> 03:17:48.354
And today will be the last day.

03:17:50.531 --> 03:17:51.589
Maybe today.

03:17:56.838 --> 03:17:58.533
I've got to ride up there.

03:18:02.610 --> 03:18:03.634
Well, Lo.

03:18:05.546 --> 03:18:07.070
I'll see you at the top.

03:18:28.670 --> 03:18:31.332
My God, Lo. Isn't it marvelous?

03:18:32.507 --> 03:18:34.270
I thought we missed it all.

03:18:35.576 --> 03:18:36.565
Any questions?

03:18:36.644 --> 03:18:37.542
No.

03:18:37.612 --> 03:18:38.704
All right, then.

03:18:38.780 --> 03:18:41.544
When the firing ceases,
we step out real quick.

03:18:41.649 --> 03:18:45.085
No halting, no stopping to fire.
We want to get there quick as we can.

03:18:45.486 --> 03:18:46.646
What about Garnett?

03:18:46.721 --> 03:18:49.485
- What about him?
- He can't hardly walk.

03:18:49.757 --> 03:18:50.746
Damnation.

03:18:51.859 --> 03:18:55.124
George, order him not to make the charge.

03:18:55.296 --> 03:18:58.993
General Armistead, how can I do that?

03:19:05.773 --> 03:19:07.104
General Armistead, sir.

03:19:08.810 --> 03:19:10.334
My compliments.

03:19:17.118 --> 03:19:20.383
I hope Her Majesty's emissary
passed a comfortable night.

03:19:20.688 --> 03:19:22.485
Slept like the dead, sir.

03:19:22.557 --> 03:19:26.015
A baby. Slept like a newborn baby, sir.

03:19:30.698 --> 03:19:32.791
Lie still, men. Keep down.

03:19:34.836 --> 03:19:36.929
There's no safe place here.

03:19:39.941 --> 03:19:41.909
One spot's as good as the next.

03:19:50.251 --> 03:19:52.481
We've been firing for a good while, sir.

03:19:52.553 --> 03:19:57.115
It's apparent neither the federals nor we
are going to gain a clear advantage.

03:19:57.325 --> 03:19:59.987
If we continue to expend our ammunition
at this rate...

03:20:00.061 --> 03:20:02.689
...we may endanger our ability
to support the advance.

03:20:02.930 --> 03:20:05.558
Did you not have enough ordinance
when this was begun?

03:20:06.033 --> 03:20:09.969
The federal fire compelled us to remove
the artillery train farther to the rear.

03:20:10.805 --> 03:20:13.740
It's taking us longer to refill the caissons.

03:20:13.808 --> 03:20:16.368
Sir, we must slow down our fire now...

03:20:16.444 --> 03:20:20.005
...or we will have to cut back on the guns
sent in to support the infantry.

03:20:20.515 --> 03:20:21.607
Damn!

03:20:22.016 --> 03:20:26.612
I'll have to order General Pickett to halt
his attack until these guns get replenished.

03:20:26.687 --> 03:20:30.350
The trains have a little ammunition.
It'll take an hour to redistribute it.

03:20:30.424 --> 03:20:32.892
In the meanwhile,
the enemy would impound the top.

03:20:33.027 --> 03:20:34.255
The more we delay...

03:20:34.328 --> 03:20:37.456
...the more time the federals have
to strengthen their own lines.

03:20:37.532 --> 03:20:40.626
And even if we recover more supplies
from the ordinance train...

03:20:40.701 --> 03:20:43.727
...how much more damage can we inflict
on them than they on us?

03:20:44.138 --> 03:20:47.403
They're bringing in fresh batteries
as quickly as we drive them off.

03:20:47.475 --> 03:20:49.739
Just get some more ammunition
and keep it hot.

03:20:50.278 --> 03:20:52.644
I can't send Pickett's Division
or the others...

03:20:52.780 --> 03:20:55.749
...until we clear some of those guns
off that ridge.

03:21:32.587 --> 03:21:36.489
I'm told you are descended
from an illustrious military family.

03:21:37.158 --> 03:21:39.251
Who told you that? Kemper?

03:21:39.660 --> 03:21:42.823
He tells me it was your uncle
who defended Fort McHenry...

03:21:42.897 --> 03:21:44.592
...during the War of 1812.

03:21:45.433 --> 03:21:50.097
And that he was therefore the guardian
of the original "Star Spangled Banner."

03:21:50.204 --> 03:21:53.298
I must say,
I do appreciate the irony of it all.

03:21:53.975 --> 03:21:55.499
Colonel Fremantle.

03:21:56.177 --> 03:22:00.705
It does not begin or end with my uncle
or myself.

03:22:02.049 --> 03:22:04.381
We're all sons of Virginia here.

03:22:08.089 --> 03:22:10.250
That major out there
commanding the cannon:

03:22:10.524 --> 03:22:11.752
That's James Dearing.

03:22:12.159 --> 03:22:15.856
First in his class at West Point,
before Virginia seceded.

03:22:16.130 --> 03:22:18.655
And the boy over there
with the color guard.

03:22:19.300 --> 03:22:21.894
That's Private Robert Tyler Jones.

03:22:22.303 --> 03:22:26.330
His grandfather was president
of the United States.

03:22:27.508 --> 03:22:31.308
The colonel behind me,
that's Colonel William Aylett.

03:22:32.413 --> 03:22:34.347
Now, his great grandfather...

03:22:35.082 --> 03:22:37.516
...was the Virginian, Patrick Henry.

03:22:40.688 --> 03:22:44.522
It was Patrick Henry
who said to your King George lll:

03:22:45.259 --> 03:22:47.750
"Give me liberty or give me death."

03:22:52.233 --> 03:22:54.030
There are boys here from...

03:22:54.602 --> 03:22:55.899
...Norfolk.

03:22:56.971 --> 03:22:58.461
Portsmouth.

03:22:59.140 --> 03:23:01.973
Small hamlets along the James River.

03:23:02.910 --> 03:23:05.572
From Charlottesville and Fredericksburg.

03:23:05.813 --> 03:23:07.804
The Shenandoah Valley.

03:23:10.284 --> 03:23:13.014
Mostly they're all veteran soldiers now.

03:23:13.154 --> 03:23:15.850
The cowards and shirkers are long gone.

03:23:17.792 --> 03:23:20.920
Every man here knows his duty.

03:23:22.763 --> 03:23:27.496
They would make this charge
even without an officer to lead them.

03:23:31.405 --> 03:23:33.873
They know the gravity of the situation.

03:23:34.475 --> 03:23:36.875
And the mettle of their foe.

03:23:38.612 --> 03:23:41.775
They know that this day's work...

03:23:43.818 --> 03:23:46.082
...will be desperate and deadly.

03:23:47.588 --> 03:23:50.785
They know that for many of them...

03:23:51.359 --> 03:23:53.486
...this will be their last charge.

03:23:55.563 --> 03:23:59.761
But not one of them needs to be told
what is expected of him.

03:24:00.668 --> 03:24:03.603
They are all willing to make
the supreme sacrifice...

03:24:05.172 --> 03:24:09.108
...to achieve victory here.

03:24:11.312 --> 03:24:15.112
The crowning victory
and the end of this war.

03:24:18.419 --> 03:24:19.852
We are all here.

03:24:22.690 --> 03:24:25.625
You may tell them
when you return to your country...

03:24:26.327 --> 03:24:30.127
...that all Virginia was here on this day.

03:25:00.327 --> 03:25:02.056
A message from Alexander.

03:25:02.296 --> 03:25:06.096
"Hurry up, for God's sake,
or the artillery can't help you."

03:25:07.968 --> 03:25:09.560
Your order, sir?

03:25:12.940 --> 03:25:16.671
General Longstreet,
should I commence the attack?

03:25:22.817 --> 03:25:25.115
I shall lead my division forward, sir.

03:25:56.984 --> 03:26:00.010
For the glory of Virginia,
form your brigade.

03:26:05.392 --> 03:26:06.791
Gentlemen...

03:26:08.062 --> 03:26:09.620
...form your battalions.

03:26:12.433 --> 03:26:14.867
Battalion, forward!

03:28:20.361 --> 03:28:24.525
Father, into your hands,
I commend my spirit.

03:28:48.322 --> 03:28:52.383
Up, men! Up! And to your posts!

03:28:54.061 --> 03:28:56.393
And let no man forget today...

03:28:57.097 --> 03:29:00.931
...that you are from old Virginia.

03:29:02.636 --> 03:29:07.039
Virginia!

03:29:13.314 --> 03:29:14.679
Virginians!

03:29:19.653 --> 03:29:22.816
For your lands!
For your homes!

03:29:25.458 --> 03:29:26.982
For your sweethearts!

03:29:28.561 --> 03:29:29.858
For your wives!

03:29:32.565 --> 03:29:34.829
For Virginia!

03:29:37.170 --> 03:29:38.865
Forward!

03:29:39.005 --> 03:29:41.701
Forward!

03:29:47.113 --> 03:29:48.375
March!

03:35:41.868 --> 03:35:44.166
Come on, men!
And keep your heads down!

03:35:45.104 --> 03:35:47.038
- Reload!
- Reloading!

03:38:37.610 --> 03:38:41.046
Clear the lines! To the front, boys!
One, two!

03:38:42.515 --> 03:38:44.483
We are with you, General!

03:38:45.885 --> 03:38:47.352
Come on, boy!

03:38:51.791 --> 03:38:53.258
Come on, boy!

03:38:53.593 --> 03:38:54.992
The glasses!

03:39:45.711 --> 03:39:47.736
Let's go! Over the fence!

03:39:57.089 --> 03:39:58.579
Fill that gap!

03:40:02.495 --> 03:40:04.019
Over the fence!

03:40:30.556 --> 03:40:32.251
Come on, men! Move!

03:40:32.458 --> 03:40:36.827
But save your strength for the attack
and get over the fence, quickly!

03:40:59.885 --> 03:41:03.616
Give them double cannons! That's it!
Double cannons!

03:41:07.193 --> 03:41:09.684
Get up, men! Fire!

03:41:23.275 --> 03:41:25.266
Give them the cold steel!

03:42:10.389 --> 03:42:12.983
Take that to General Longstreet
quick as you can.

03:42:13.058 --> 03:42:14.548
With my compliments.

03:42:15.861 --> 03:42:17.624
Damnation! Come on!

03:42:30.843 --> 03:42:32.105
Do it!

03:42:32.878 --> 03:42:34.402
Fire away, men!

03:42:34.880 --> 03:42:36.245
Move it up!

03:42:36.882 --> 03:42:38.975
Steady! Keep that line there!

03:42:41.287 --> 03:42:43.380
Keep up your fire! Colonel!

03:42:47.026 --> 03:42:49.494
Bring your men forward.
We'll flank these bastards.

03:42:49.562 --> 03:42:50.859
Bring the men forward.

03:42:50.930 --> 03:42:52.898
By God, we'll flank them.

03:42:56.735 --> 03:42:58.134
Damn it all!

03:43:01.173 --> 03:43:02.936
I will not be moved...

03:43:03.542 --> 03:43:05.407
...until this engagement is started.

03:43:06.712 --> 03:43:09.613
Get me a tourniquet
before I bleed to death.

03:43:15.488 --> 03:43:16.978
Forward, boys!

03:43:40.713 --> 03:43:41.873
What are you doing?

03:43:42.181 --> 03:43:44.547
You've got to come up and help us.

03:43:44.950 --> 03:43:46.781
In God's name, they're flanking us.

03:43:46.852 --> 03:43:49.412
Coming down on the right
and firing right into us.

03:43:50.356 --> 03:43:52.824
Head for the trees.
Head right for the center.

03:43:53.058 --> 03:43:55.891
I'll call for double-quick. Nobody waits.

03:43:56.128 --> 03:43:58.426
- Everybody goes.
- All right.

03:44:00.132 --> 03:44:02.930
Boys! At the double-quick!

03:44:06.839 --> 03:44:08.466
March!

03:44:10.175 --> 03:44:11.904
Come on! Together!

03:44:35.601 --> 03:44:39.059
Come on, boys! They're breaking!

03:44:46.845 --> 03:44:48.938
Forward to the wall!

03:45:09.635 --> 03:45:11.432
Get them to the ridge, boys!

03:45:43.802 --> 03:45:46.498
Move out, boys! Move out!

03:45:50.643 --> 03:45:51.974
Come on, boy.

03:45:52.378 --> 03:45:54.846
What will you think of yourself tomorrow?

03:45:55.714 --> 03:45:57.079
Virginians!

03:46:00.853 --> 03:46:04.755
We're staying. Who will come with me?

03:46:06.025 --> 03:46:07.549
Let's go, boys!

03:46:19.104 --> 03:46:20.901
That's the style, Lo.

03:46:21.340 --> 03:46:22.967
That's the style!

03:47:43.822 --> 03:47:45.449
The day is ours, men!

03:47:45.724 --> 03:47:48.693
Turn the cannons on them!
Turn the cannons!

03:49:22.988 --> 03:49:24.478
Break them, Lo!

03:49:34.633 --> 03:49:37.864
What's happening?
I can't see what's happening to my boys!

03:49:39.404 --> 03:49:41.531
What's happening to my boys?

03:49:41.807 --> 03:49:43.434
Major, give me your glasses.

03:49:48.680 --> 03:49:51.205
There's a rebel. Take him prisoner.

03:51:31.817 --> 03:51:34.615
Will you help me up, please?

03:51:34.953 --> 03:51:38.047
Sir, could you tell me what your name is?
Who you are?

03:51:39.891 --> 03:51:42.416
I would like to see General Hancock.

03:51:42.894 --> 03:51:48.332
Do you know where General Hancock
may be found?

03:51:49.801 --> 03:51:52.497
I'm sorry, sir. The general is down.

03:51:52.738 --> 03:51:54.968
- He's been hit.
- No!

03:51:56.208 --> 03:51:57.903
Not both of us.

03:51:59.411 --> 03:52:01.436
Not all of us.

03:52:02.714 --> 03:52:04.375
Please, God.

03:52:04.449 --> 03:52:07.885
Sir, we're having a surgeon come
as quickly as we can.

03:52:10.956 --> 03:52:13.117
Can you hear me, son?

03:52:13.291 --> 03:52:15.725
Yes, sir. I can hear you.

03:52:16.728 --> 03:52:19.788
Will you tell General Hancock...

03:52:21.433 --> 03:52:25.631
...that General Armistead
sends his regrets?

03:52:28.340 --> 03:52:30.240
Will you tell him...

03:52:31.443 --> 03:52:35.675
...how very sorry I am?

03:52:38.283 --> 03:52:42.014
I will tell him, sir. I will tell him.

03:52:57.636 --> 03:52:59.297
General Webb, sir.

03:53:44.182 --> 03:53:46.309
Let go of the horse, Major.

03:53:46.852 --> 03:53:49.184
Major Sorrel, I said let go of the horse.

03:53:49.254 --> 03:53:51.415
Now you form up here,
put fire down on them.

03:53:51.490 --> 03:53:53.958
They're coming
and I'm going to meet them.

03:53:55.894 --> 03:53:57.862
Captain Goree. Come on!

03:54:19.117 --> 03:54:22.211
General, what are your orders, sir?
What do you want me to do?

03:54:22.587 --> 03:54:23.952
Where do you want me to go?

03:54:33.365 --> 03:54:35.799
You've got to pull back, General.
Pull back, sir.

03:54:35.867 --> 03:54:38.199
Place the guns. Bring up the guns!

03:54:43.475 --> 03:54:44.533
God!

03:54:51.149 --> 03:54:52.639
How are you, T.J.?

03:54:52.951 --> 03:54:54.680
I'm tolerable, sir.

03:54:58.223 --> 03:54:59.622
They aren't coming.

03:54:59.824 --> 03:55:01.052
Too bad.

03:55:03.862 --> 03:55:04.851
Yes, sir.

03:55:06.798 --> 03:55:08.026
General.

03:55:09.034 --> 03:55:10.797
I'll tell you plain.

03:55:12.103 --> 03:55:13.934
There are times when you worry me.

03:55:16.141 --> 03:55:18.268
No good trying to get yourself killed.

03:55:18.743 --> 03:55:21.177
The Lord will come for you
in his own good time.

03:55:24.649 --> 03:55:26.640
What are the orders, sir?

03:55:31.022 --> 03:55:34.981
Prepare for defense,
but the Yankees aren't coming.

03:55:37.929 --> 03:55:39.419
Come on, boys.

03:55:45.804 --> 03:55:48.398
I have the figures from Pickett's command.

03:55:49.608 --> 03:55:51.508
General Armistead is missing.

03:55:52.210 --> 03:55:55.577
General Garnett,
missing and figured to be dead, sir.

03:55:56.514 --> 03:55:59.210
General Kemper is down,
seriously wounded.

03:56:00.218 --> 03:56:05.485
Sir, of the 13 colonels in Pickett's division,
seven are dead and six are wounded.

03:56:05.557 --> 03:56:08.151
No more. You tell me the rest later.

03:56:20.605 --> 03:56:22.573
- Major?
- Yes, sir.

03:56:22.774 --> 03:56:25.572
Is that General Kemper
there bearing toward us?

03:56:26.144 --> 03:56:28.112
I believe it to be, sir.

03:56:32.317 --> 03:56:33.784
General Kemper.

03:56:35.320 --> 03:56:37.413
I do hope you are not seriously injured.

03:56:41.359 --> 03:56:44.658
They tell me that it's mortal, General.

03:56:44.963 --> 03:56:47.591
I do pray God that it is not the case.

03:56:47.966 --> 03:56:49.456
Is there anything I can do?

03:56:49.868 --> 03:56:52.769
There's nothing more you can do for me.

03:56:55.540 --> 03:57:00.978
But, General Lee, will you see to it
that full justice is done for my men...

03:57:03.948 --> 03:57:06.382
...who made this charge today?

03:57:07.519 --> 03:57:08.884
I will do so, sir.

03:57:08.953 --> 03:57:10.682
Thank you, General.

03:57:15.527 --> 03:57:17.017
Thank you, General.

03:57:19.898 --> 03:57:21.388
It's my fault.

03:57:23.435 --> 03:57:24.766
It's my fault.

03:57:27.906 --> 03:57:30.272
I thought we were invincible.

03:57:31.109 --> 03:57:32.201
Friends.

03:57:33.378 --> 03:57:34.902
It is all my fault.

03:57:36.281 --> 03:57:37.179
Hear me.

03:57:38.016 --> 03:57:39.813
Hear me, I pray you.

03:57:40.285 --> 03:57:42.014
It is entirely my fault.

03:57:43.655 --> 03:57:44.883
Hear me.

03:57:45.123 --> 03:57:46.988
Hear me. Please, friends.

03:57:47.759 --> 03:57:49.226
We must rest now.

03:57:50.061 --> 03:57:52.222
We must retire
and fight again another day.

03:57:52.297 --> 03:57:54.527
And there will be another day.

03:57:54.866 --> 03:57:57.733
Meanwhile, friends,
we must show good order.

03:57:57.936 --> 03:58:00.097
Never let them see you run.
Do you hear me?

03:58:00.605 --> 03:58:02.300
Never let them see you run.

03:58:02.374 --> 03:58:05.172
Let us hit them again.
Let us reform and hit them again.

03:58:05.243 --> 03:58:06.437
I know we can do it.

03:58:09.514 --> 03:58:11.345
God bless you, gentlemen.

03:58:15.987 --> 03:58:19.047
They're forming over there, Major.
I do fear they may attack.

03:58:19.124 --> 03:58:20.386
Yes, sir.

03:58:22.894 --> 03:58:24.259
General Pickett.

03:58:25.163 --> 03:58:29.725
You may reform to the rear of this ridge
and set up a defensive position.

03:58:35.173 --> 03:58:38.870
General Pickett, sir.
You must look to your division.

03:58:46.651 --> 03:58:47.811
General Lee.

03:58:50.955 --> 03:58:52.479
I have no division.

04:00:02.060 --> 04:00:03.721
General <i>... </i>

04:00:15.607 --> 04:00:17.507
We will withdraw...

04:00:18.643 --> 04:00:22.170
...as soon as we have secured
all those wounded...

04:00:24.749 --> 04:00:27.047
...or who are well enough to be moved.

04:00:31.356 --> 04:00:33.290
If we can reach the Potomac...

04:00:35.260 --> 04:00:37.387
...and cross over into Virginia...

04:00:39.230 --> 04:00:42.063
...there will be no more immediate danger.

04:00:44.802 --> 04:00:46.463
But I'll need your help, Pete.

04:00:54.279 --> 04:00:56.747
I'm so very tired.

04:00:59.484 --> 04:01:00.712
What can I do, sir?

04:01:07.358 --> 04:01:08.586
General?

04:01:19.103 --> 04:01:21.628
We must look to our own deportment.

04:01:26.110 --> 04:01:29.841
The spirit of the army is still very good.
Very good indeed.

04:01:34.185 --> 04:01:36.483
We will do better another time.

04:01:41.726 --> 04:01:45.662
They do not die for us. Not for us.

04:01:48.333 --> 04:01:50.460
That at least is a blessing.

04:01:53.471 --> 04:01:55.336
If this war goes on <i>... </i>

04:01:56.608 --> 04:01:57.768
And it will.

04:01:58.509 --> 04:01:59.737
It will.

04:02:01.479 --> 04:02:03.777
What else can we do but go on, you and I?

04:02:05.316 --> 04:02:08.843
It's always the same question forever.

04:02:10.622 --> 04:02:12.487
What else can we do?

04:02:13.825 --> 04:02:15.656
If they fight...

04:02:16.794 --> 04:02:18.489
...we must fight with them.

04:02:20.632 --> 04:02:23.100
And does it matter, after all, who wins?

04:02:25.536 --> 04:02:27.800
Was that ever really the question?

04:02:31.275 --> 04:02:34.108
Will almighty God
ask that question in the end?
