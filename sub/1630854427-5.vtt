WEBVTT

00:06.840 --> 00:08.920
[Cornelia] This is a lock
of my son's hair...

00:10.680 --> 00:13.960
It got me this far like it was magic.

00:14.960 --> 00:16.400
[Eli] You die violent or ill?

00:16.520 --> 00:17.360
[Cornelia] Why?

00:17.400 --> 00:21.280
Violent takes the short road,
the illness the long.

00:21.360 --> 00:22.520
Which one did yours?

00:23.640 --> 00:25.360
[Martha] Don't go thinking
you're no gentleman!

00:26.160 --> 00:28.880
It's a mistake, of anyone
to give the likes of Billy Myers

00:28.960 --> 00:30.280
-the chance to start again.
-[Jed] Hey!

00:30.360 --> 00:31.800
[Cornelia] You were in the army?

00:31.880 --> 00:32.680
I got enemies.

00:33.040 --> 00:33.840
Bushwhacking?

00:34.200 --> 00:35.480
You care to join us?

00:36.200 --> 00:37.400
-[gunshot]
-[horse neighs]

00:37.480 --> 00:40.400
People working that line for years...
it's competition.

00:40.880 --> 00:42.680
Black Eyed Mog and her boys.

00:43.880 --> 00:47.520
[Black Eyed Mog] I dunno boys,
I'll save my snatch for something bigger.

00:47.600 --> 00:48.400
[horse neighs]

00:48.480 --> 00:50.680
[Cornelia] It cannot be
that this whole country's

00:50.760 --> 00:52.440
only full of killers and thieves.

00:54.640 --> 00:55.560
Where is he?

00:55.640 --> 00:57.280
-Who'd you sell him up to?
-Didn't...

00:58.720 --> 01:00.600
My name is Kills on Water.

01:01.960 --> 01:03.360
You don't know me...

01:03.440 --> 01:05.440
the massacre at Chalk River.

01:06.720 --> 01:08.280
They were my family.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.240
Why you fight for the Blues.

01:34.560 --> 01:35.960
I fought for my people.

01:36.040 --> 01:38.400
The English were never your people.

01:38.480 --> 01:39.920
My enemy's enemy.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.920
Then I am yours. And you are mine.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.680
-War's over.
-Hmm.

01:45.560 --> 01:49.600
And when you went home,
was it still there?

01:52.520 --> 01:53.840
Or you still look?

01:54.520 --> 01:56.360
Not asking for blame or favor.

01:56.880 --> 01:57.920
Then what?

01:58.880 --> 02:01.320
One-sixty acres, my choosing.

02:01.400 --> 02:02.960
-Where?
-Nebraska.

02:03.360 --> 02:04.360
The Loup.

02:04.440 --> 02:05.400
That the dream?

02:05.480 --> 02:06.600
My reality.

02:07.520 --> 02:08.840
Mine by rights.

02:10.240 --> 02:11.320
How long you been out?

02:11.840 --> 02:12.720
The Army.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.760
A-whiles.

02:14.720 --> 02:18.240
At what point of, first day,
you realize you ain't got no rights?

02:18.560 --> 02:19.760
They done took 'em.

02:20.560 --> 02:21.600
Took 'em all.

02:22.720 --> 02:25.880
And for you, they even stole your loyalty.

02:25.960 --> 02:27.520
I was proud to serve.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.760
In a war you were only bound to lose?

02:32.560 --> 02:35.560
I'm guessing it's that dream though
keeping you alive.

02:36.440 --> 02:39.160
Reality is you ain't ever gonna get there.

02:41.160 --> 02:42.880
I'm guessing you know that too.

02:43.760 --> 02:44.880
Deep down.

02:46.520 --> 02:50.360
And you're just trying to figure out
what you can do to take its place.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.960
That woman you're traveling with.

02:56.680 --> 02:57.640
Where's she headed?

02:57.720 --> 03:00.720
[dramatic music playing]

03:03.040 --> 03:05.680
Maybe it's best for you
to change direction.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.440
Take you there instead.

03:11.320 --> 03:13.280
Ain't no other dream to be had.

03:15.080 --> 03:16.240
First...

03:18.120 --> 03:20.080
there's something I want you to do for me.

03:21.520 --> 03:23.240
You're at Decent Kill.

03:23.760 --> 03:26.080
Captain Clegg and his crew...

03:27.640 --> 03:28.800
The Pawnee...

03:29.240 --> 03:30.840
got an arrow in his back.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.400
They worked that line for me!

03:34.160 --> 03:35.440
My business.

03:38.600 --> 03:42.720
Twice now you turned my world upside down.

03:43.280 --> 03:45.120
Yeah, I want you to turn it back.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.960
There's a woman
looking to take over that line.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.240
But not for me.

03:51.760 --> 03:53.280
Her name's Black-Eyed Mog...

03:54.240 --> 03:56.840
but don't get so close now,
you figure out why.

03:58.080 --> 04:00.120
She's partial to lifting our hair.

04:01.120 --> 04:03.840
Cheyenne, Pawnee, she ain't fussy.

04:03.920 --> 04:05.880
Any skin that looks like ours.

04:06.320 --> 04:07.800
Quite the collection, I hear.

04:08.280 --> 04:09.520
Man.

04:09.600 --> 04:10.560
Woman.

04:10.640 --> 04:11.680
Child.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.600
I want you to stop her.

04:17.320 --> 04:18.240
Kill her.

04:18.360 --> 04:19.760
Won't happen otherwise.

04:19.840 --> 04:22.800
I want you to make it your business.

04:24.440 --> 04:27.040
See the world as it really is.

04:28.480 --> 04:29.640
Us...

04:30.800 --> 04:31.880
them.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.480
As it always was.

04:34.560 --> 04:36.640
And always will be.

04:38.880 --> 04:40.200
Then maybe...

04:41.240 --> 04:42.760
I give you back this.

04:44.320 --> 04:49.320
And maybe "my enemy's enemy"
will finally become my friend.

04:49.680 --> 04:52.680
[suspenseful music playing]

04:53.760 --> 04:56.760
[dramatic music playing]

06:17.360 --> 06:18.680
Well...

06:19.240 --> 06:21.280
wandering minstrel,

06:21.360 --> 06:25.120
lovely as it is to greet a Sais in Kansas

06:25.920 --> 06:30.440
I can't help but wonder
why you chose my door.

06:39.280 --> 06:40.640
Whose are those?

06:40.720 --> 06:44.160
Any one of them
foolish enough to cross my path.

06:44.240 --> 06:46.480
Saw you got a boy penned up in the stable.

06:46.560 --> 06:47.360
Uh-uh.

06:47.440 --> 06:48.440
Him too?

06:48.520 --> 06:49.600
Oh...

06:50.320 --> 06:52.800
I like to savor the moment.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.320
Why?

07:31.840 --> 07:35.080
Cheyenne '68,

07:37.400 --> 07:39.240
I was 21.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.720
And they took everything else besides...

07:44.560 --> 07:49.040
my virtue and my family.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.320
Sort of "Coming of Age" present, really.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.760
Don't need to tell you about my eyelids.

07:58.160 --> 08:00.080
That's over 20 years ago,

08:00.160 --> 08:02.200
what is that, 50 scalps?

08:04.960 --> 08:07.120
You don't think you've more
than evened the score?

08:08.040 --> 08:11.280
Not 'til every last one is on that wall.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.520
And what about me?

08:13.040 --> 08:15.600
I'm guessing by now you've found
the contents of my bags.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.320
Ah, that's a lot of money.

08:17.400 --> 08:18.960
You going to put me up there?

08:20.760 --> 08:22.320
Surely, it'd break the pattern.

08:23.520 --> 08:27.920
Well, not sure what my boys
have in mind for you.

08:28.760 --> 08:30.840
Sure it'll be a lot of fun.

08:36.520 --> 08:38.760
So, I met with a John Clarke,

08:38.880 --> 08:40.240
he's a Kickapoo.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.000
Would you like to work with him?

08:43.080 --> 08:44.640
Only with a knife.

08:45.520 --> 08:49.520
Well, he told me something,
I thought you'd like to know.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Kills On Water, have you heard of him?

08:55.200 --> 08:56.640
Hates my guts.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.200
Must do.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.880
He's the one that left them
inside my body.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.840
I'm travelling with a friend.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.160
He's Pawnee.

09:08.760 --> 09:10.000
Practiced killer.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.640
And John Clarke told me that your enemy,

09:13.880 --> 09:16.840
he is about to send my friend to kill...
you.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.200
Why you telling me?

09:20.720 --> 09:23.400
I just don't want my friend to die.

09:26.160 --> 09:28.520
So why didn't you stop him from coming?

09:28.640 --> 09:30.280
Cause I can't get to him.

09:30.360 --> 09:31.160
Hmm...

09:31.520 --> 09:33.080
Your enemy has him prisoner.

09:33.160 --> 09:34.760
And I'm thinking...

09:36.240 --> 09:38.480
your life is the cost of his freedom.

09:39.080 --> 09:44.120
So, I just decided the next best thing
was come to you instead.

09:45.480 --> 09:47.880
Then you made a mistake,

09:47.960 --> 09:49.640
cause now you've given me the jump.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.640
Now, well that was the risk,
I know, I know.

09:51.720 --> 09:54.000
But then I just thought
that if I was the one who told you

09:54.080 --> 09:55.720
and you saw the money and everything

09:55.760 --> 09:57.280
and it was all going to go the way it has,

09:57.360 --> 10:00.040
well then you might let me...

10:00.640 --> 10:02.280
get the jump on you.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.000
[grunts]

10:11.840 --> 10:12.760
You shot my ma...

10:12.880 --> 10:14.040
-[gunshot]
-[groans]

10:51.320 --> 10:52.760
[gunshot]

10:58.240 --> 11:02.080
Mummy said
you wanna have some fun with me.

11:06.360 --> 11:11.880
And right now, I'd say
shooting your cock 'n balls clean off

11:11.960 --> 11:14.440
would be about the most fun
a woman could have.

11:19.640 --> 11:24.640
But lucky for you...
I'm not feeling very funny.

11:35.360 --> 11:38.040
[suspenseful music playing]

11:38.120 --> 11:39.280
[grunts]

11:46.320 --> 11:49.320
[dramatic music playing]

11:50.480 --> 11:51.560
Christ, I could have shot you.

11:58.040 --> 12:01.520
When I first came here my friend told me,

12:01.600 --> 12:04.680
the difference between what you want
and what you need

12:05.280 --> 12:07.000
is what you can put on a horse.

12:08.680 --> 12:10.120
No better lesson.

12:11.520 --> 12:12.720
Choose yours...

12:17.320 --> 12:20.320
[dramatic music playing]

12:23.040 --> 12:24.840
[knocks on door]

12:42.120 --> 12:44.280
[Cornelia] I've come for Eli Whipp.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
[dramatic music playing]

13:31.440 --> 13:32.480
It's warm.

13:36.040 --> 13:37.200
Were you burned?

13:37.440 --> 13:38.240
It's nothing.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.800
You want I take a look?

13:41.880 --> 13:43.640
No, I'm fine, thank you.

13:46.040 --> 13:47.360
Can't let it infect.

13:47.440 --> 13:48.480
It won't.

13:50.360 --> 13:51.400
Up here neither.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.040
Short time to come such a long way.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.040
What from Oklahoma?

14:01.040 --> 14:02.560
You don't know where I started.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.480
It's getting clearer by the day.

14:12.600 --> 14:13.800
Who's the boy?

14:15.200 --> 14:16.360
[Cornelia] I rescued him.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.040
And he did the same for me.

14:20.440 --> 14:24.040
I call him No Trouble
because that's what he's been.

14:25.600 --> 14:26.960
Where should I take him?

14:27.440 --> 14:28.520
[Eli] He can go his own way,

14:30.000 --> 14:30.960
with or without us.

14:32.480 --> 14:33.600
Us?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.960
Thought, maybe I take you
where you wanna go.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.120
You hear the name Billy Myers?

14:40.200 --> 14:41.320
[Cornelia] No.

14:42.680 --> 14:44.280
Lives up where you want to go.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.200
Thinking on paying him a visit.

14:47.280 --> 14:48.200
Why?

14:50.160 --> 14:51.320
You got a secret?

14:54.560 --> 14:56.080
One you ain't yet told?

15:00.200 --> 15:01.360
It's okay,

15:02.760 --> 15:04.120
you ain't the only one.

15:05.080 --> 15:08.960
You see I told you there is magic in this!

15:11.080 --> 15:12.240
You ain't got there yet.

15:12.320 --> 15:13.840
Oh, but we will!

15:14.640 --> 15:17.280
Lady, you shout so loud,
ain't just lightening gonna hit us.

15:17.360 --> 15:20.480
I reckon we could part the clouds
if we wanted to!

15:23.360 --> 15:25.400
Ain't no destiny in this, Cornelia.

15:27.320 --> 15:28.880
Just a whole lot of aiming.

15:30.120 --> 15:31.720
And then one day a miss.

15:33.240 --> 15:34.360
And that's it.

15:36.240 --> 15:38.480
You think I'm travelling with hope?

15:39.720 --> 15:40.920
Oh, Eli.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.920
Just without fear.

15:46.520 --> 15:47.760
And you know why?

15:49.120 --> 15:50.680
Cause I'm dead already.

15:53.040 --> 15:56.040
[dramatic music playing]

16:03.400 --> 16:04.280
[Thomas] Yerp!

16:05.760 --> 16:06.920
[gunshot]

16:13.640 --> 16:15.360
Reminds me of the chairman of my board.

16:22.240 --> 16:25.600
Eton College,
the Guards think you'd like him.

16:26.280 --> 16:27.160
Yeah?

16:27.240 --> 16:28.640
Son of an Earl.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.960
Sounds like just my kind of fella.

16:31.040 --> 16:34.040
Certainly trying to dive
into David Melmont's pockets.

16:35.640 --> 16:38.280
Hope there'll be enough room,
what with you stuffed in there already.

16:38.360 --> 16:41.160
Are you gonna give
Martha Myers back her cattle?

16:42.600 --> 16:43.800
Maverick Law.

16:44.560 --> 16:45.560
Mine by rights.

16:45.640 --> 16:48.520
I hope you've enough of that
to see you through the winter.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.880
[Thomas] You a cattleman there,
Sheriff Marshall?

16:50.960 --> 16:52.640
I was here in '86.

16:52.720 --> 16:56.000
I saw what a hard freeze
can do to your herd.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.960
I've been here since '75.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.680
I know exactly what this country can do.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.240
No one knows it better.

17:04.920 --> 17:07.120
'Cept David Melmont.

17:10.560 --> 17:13.200
Because he arrived here with you,
didn't he?

17:13.280 --> 17:14.680
Opened up this whole valley.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.560
Just you, him.

17:17.440 --> 17:18.920
Quite a challenge.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.480
We weren't partners,

17:21.560 --> 17:22.920
he was my employee.

17:23.000 --> 17:23.960
Tough then,

17:24.920 --> 17:27.800
a blue-blooded Englishman like you
being "bled out"

17:27.880 --> 17:30.240
by an ex-employee,

17:30.720 --> 17:35.160
who seemed to make his fortune
in nothing so lowly

17:36.080 --> 17:37.480
as trade?

17:40.520 --> 17:42.280
He didn't make it in trade.

17:42.320 --> 17:45.640
Well, he's looking to now, so he is.

17:45.720 --> 17:47.400
And all that's getting fat

17:47.480 --> 17:50.800
on your business is the vultures.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.520
Take the snake.

17:55.320 --> 17:57.640
Get two meals
and a hatband out of that one.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.240
I know I once did.

18:01.320 --> 18:04.880
Thanks but,
Melmont's got in some chilled meat.

18:05.720 --> 18:09.560
Fancy myself a nice pork chop.

18:27.560 --> 18:28.720
[Mrs. Myers sighs]

18:29.680 --> 18:32.200
If you look at this really closely,

18:32.280 --> 18:34.800
you might be able to see

18:34.880 --> 18:38.280
some letters underneath that scar.

18:38.320 --> 18:42.960
You want me to stare
at a dead man's dead butt.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.160
The thing is,

18:45.200 --> 18:50.520
Timothy Flynn had exactly the same mark...

18:53.640 --> 18:55.920
in exactly the same place.

18:56.560 --> 18:59.880
Except he didn't try to...

19:00.560 --> 19:01.720
Get rid of it.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.200
No. And your husband did.

19:05.880 --> 19:06.920
Why'd he do that?

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Is that it?

19:09.320 --> 19:13.040
Er, Grover Best, er, wondered

19:13.080 --> 19:15.480
where you'll be wanting the committal.

19:15.560 --> 19:16.960
[Mrs. Myers] Hadn't figured on it.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.080
You talk to Thomas Trafford?

19:19.200 --> 19:20.080
I did.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.920
It's Maverick Law, Mrs. Myers.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.080
They were marked.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.080
Not officially.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.040
They're mine.

19:27.080 --> 19:28.920
Not if they're out on the range.

19:29.000 --> 19:29.800
Fence broke.

19:29.880 --> 19:33.520
I can only uphold the law as it stands.

19:33.560 --> 19:37.000
I. Want. Them. Back.

19:38.240 --> 19:41.200
Hmm-mmm, I can always,

19:42.000 --> 19:43.400
try and have another look.

19:47.560 --> 19:50.440
I'm sorry for your loss.

19:51.080 --> 19:52.320
He ain't having them.

19:53.440 --> 19:54.760
Of your husband.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.680
[inhales sharply]

20:05.400 --> 20:06.640
[Sheriff Robert] Mrs. Myers.

20:08.240 --> 20:11.640
Was everything upstanding
in your marriage?

20:12.240 --> 20:13.480
Upstanding?

20:13.560 --> 20:15.080
[Sheriff Robert] It's just that you seem

20:15.760 --> 20:20.320
a mite more interested in your cattle,

20:20.440 --> 20:22.400
if you don't mind me saying so.

20:22.480 --> 20:26.320
Difference between my cattle
and William Myers.

20:27.680 --> 20:29.080
When a steer broke my arm,

20:29.800 --> 20:30.920
it was an accident.

-Ours.

Let it slide this time,

what with your present sadness,

do it again,

21:43.960 --> 21:45.520
can't offer the same courtesy.

21:45.560 --> 21:47.440
You ain't offering me nothing

21:48.960 --> 21:51.760
and I'll take what's mine.

-Yeah?

[Eli] Chief star.

22:56.280 --> 22:57.960
Chief star...

22:58.040 --> 23:00.000
And then here, see...

23:00.080 --> 23:01.680
Three stars in a row.

23:01.760 --> 23:02.560
Hmm.

23:03.320 --> 23:05.240
You call them the hunter's belt.

23:06.320 --> 23:09.040
We call them Rahurahki, the deer.

23:09.600 --> 23:13.320
When they all point straight
down that is South...

23:13.400 --> 23:14.640
North.

23:16.920 --> 23:17.720
South.

23:19.680 --> 23:21.080

23:29.440 --> 23:30.520
Give or take.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.520
So now, if you're alone...

23:34.920 --> 23:36.680
I will always think of you.

23:36.760 --> 23:38.120
[dramatic music playing]

23:46.440 --> 23:47.680
You're still warm...

here.

23:49.960 --> 23:51.360
Well,

23:51.440 --> 23:53.480
I've just never lived like this before.

23:53.560 --> 23:55.560
I never lived anything but.

23:59.760 --> 24:00.880
So how long now?

24:01.400 --> 24:02.640
Couple days maybe.

24:02.720 --> 24:03.680
Where are we?

24:04.840 --> 24:07.560
Casper ahead, Nebraska behind.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.920
-You sure that you don't want to--
-Leave you?

24:11.680 --> 24:12.760
Go home.

24:16.960 --> 24:18.240
Long ways East.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.080
So, what's it like?

24:22.360 --> 24:24.880
When I was a boy, it was something.

24:28.320 --> 24:30.200
When we left, it was something else.

24:30.280 --> 24:31.200
And now?

24:31.280 --> 24:33.280
Guessing it's something else again.

24:35.120 --> 24:37.960
Do you think that they will
let you be a part of that?

24:39.880 --> 24:40.840
Do you?

24:44.400 --> 24:46.520
No. Not the way you'd accept.

24:51.880 --> 24:53.600
Can't tell what's changing quicker.

24:54.800 --> 24:56.120
The country, or you.

24:58.880 --> 25:01.760
Or you. Especially now
you've got no home to go to.

25:03.800 --> 25:05.120
I didn't say that.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.800
Maybe I just got to settle
on something else first.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.520
This Billy Myers.

25:14.360 --> 25:15.560
How do you know him?

25:15.640 --> 25:17.320
Crossed paths a while back.

25:17.920 --> 25:18.920
A friend?

25:21.360 --> 25:23.240
Maybe, back then, he thought as such.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.760
Why'd you want to see him?

25:24.840 --> 25:25.920
Tell him he wasn't.

25:27.640 --> 25:30.320
It's a long way to go just to say goodbye.

25:31.120 --> 25:32.160
Isn't it...

25:33.160 --> 25:36.160
[dramatic music playing]

25:45.760 --> 25:46.760

25:47.360 --> 25:48.360
Just now.

25:48.440 --> 25:49.560
Hmm...

25:51.800 --> 25:53.120
Why do you wear gloves?

25:59.480 --> 26:00.520
Practical.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.720
Well, ain't practical,
a world you can't touch.

26:04.760 --> 26:05.920
You ever take 'em off?

26:06.600 --> 26:09.640
D'you know a lady is not supposed
to until she retires home.

26:10.520 --> 26:12.000
-Who says?
-'Tis the rule.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.920
Well, you got a long wait then.

26:17.320 --> 26:18.360
Never coming.

26:20.960 --> 26:21.960
It will.

26:22.840 --> 26:23.640
One day.

26:23.720 --> 26:27.440
That is uncommonly optimistic of you,
Mister Whipp.

26:30.400 --> 26:31.400
You go back.

26:33.440 --> 26:34.320
Where?

26:34.400 --> 26:35.360
Home.

26:35.880 --> 26:37.440
Well, you see that's the problem.

26:37.520 --> 26:39.800
Um, I don't really have one anymore.

26:41.600 --> 26:42.920
You'll find it again.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.720
Hell, looks like I'm gonna have to...

26:47.800 --> 26:48.920
No, Eli.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.760
I absolutely won't.

27:01.160 --> 27:03.840
He was born on the family estate.

27:07.480 --> 27:08.480
And...

27:10.280 --> 27:12.560
we were, er, protected,

27:15.480 --> 27:16.720
not wanted.

27:17.640 --> 27:20.480
The manner of his making, you see,

27:20.560 --> 27:22.440
made outcasts of us both.

27:29.040 --> 27:30.640
And as a girl,

27:34.240 --> 27:35.680
you know the walls

27:37.000 --> 27:40.320
I walked, they beckoned the future.

27:43.280 --> 27:44.760
But as a mother,

27:46.960 --> 27:49.360
I could only walk within them.

27:52.120 --> 27:53.120
With him.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.000
For 14 years.

28:05.240 --> 28:06.720
That's where I left him.

28:07.800 --> 28:09.360
Under a willow tree,

28:10.720 --> 28:13.080
near a... near a lake.

28:16.840 --> 28:17.680
Hmm.

28:23.680 --> 28:24.760
So that's home.

28:26.520 --> 28:27.640
He is home.

28:31.880 --> 28:34.840
And I won't ever go back.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.400
In the time before.

29:02.680 --> 29:06.000
There was a woman who cared for this,

29:07.920 --> 29:08.800
my wife.

29:09.880 --> 29:12.080
She was the one who guarded it.

29:14.640 --> 29:16.000
Hung it above the wiharu...

29:18.000 --> 29:19.680

29:21.360 --> 29:22.520
On the west side.

29:23.680 --> 29:25.600

29:27.960 --> 29:29.000
When we moved...

29:31.200 --> 29:32.280
she took it with us,

29:33.840 --> 29:34.840
when we returned,

29:36.080 --> 29:36.960
she put it back.

29:42.560 --> 29:43.400
This...

29:44.720 --> 29:45.920
is home.

29:51.840 --> 29:52.720
That...

29:54.160 --> 29:55.160
is home.

29:55.240 --> 29:58.240
[dramatic music playing]

30:09.840 --> 30:11.640
There's nothing else to go back to...

30:15.880 --> 30:17.120
because it's here.

30:23.960 --> 30:24.960
With you.

30:52.520 --> 30:54.000
I'm sorry, I can't.

No Trouble...

33:07.080 --> 33:07.960
Not anymore.

33:08.840 --> 33:10.880
Three, plus him.

33:26.440 --> 33:27.840
I'll be fine.

33:30.560 --> 33:32.120
[Eli] Then let's go get the boy.

33:48.200 --> 33:50.360
[Major Mackay] Poles in, wire up,

33:50.440 --> 33:54.000
on a good day I can have me lay
twenty miles of cabling.

33:54.080 --> 33:57.360
But then, it ain't my first time
of calling round here.

34:03.240 --> 34:07.640
This is a forty, one hundred
high velocity cartridge for a Sharps '74.

34:07.720 --> 34:10.480
It's the greatest Buffalo rifle ever made.

34:10.560 --> 34:15.360
It can hit a lying cow at 766 yards.

34:15.440 --> 34:17.120
I know cause I did it.

34:17.160 --> 34:20.080
Damn near record,
four more yards I woulda been clear.

34:20.880 --> 34:23.360
I'll be honest with you I shot so many,
in such a quick time,

34:23.440 --> 34:24.680
the stench of rotting carcass

of the whole Kansas Pacific.

34:32.040 --> 34:35.360
Turn of the decade, not a hundred left.

34:37.160 --> 34:40.400
And that's what it took
to submit your people.

34:40.480 --> 34:44.200
Where bullets couldn't reach,
starvation surely would.

34:44.320 --> 34:46.880
Which is mighty ironic
considering I made myself a fortune

34:46.960 --> 34:48.880
five times over selling their tongues!

34:48.960 --> 34:52.040
[laughter]

34:52.120 --> 34:53.840
[horse neighs]

34:53.920 --> 34:57.920
Yeah, you don't hunt in England,
aristocrat like yourself?

34:58.000 --> 35:02.560
Not if it results
in the extermination of an entire people.

35:02.640 --> 35:06.160
Oh, missy, don't you go guilt-gaveling me,

35:06.280 --> 35:09.560
cause it's exactly your kind
that gave me the inspiration.

35:12.640 --> 35:16.080
You, uh, you ever take a jig
with one of her boys?

35:17.760 --> 35:18.840
No.

35:20.200 --> 35:24.400
They cleared my family out in 1819.
Strathaven, Scotland.

35:24.480 --> 35:27.320
They used rent instead of bullets mind,

35:27.400 --> 35:30.200
but the starvation came the same.

35:32.200 --> 35:34.360
I do believe they shoot grouse there now.

35:36.480 --> 35:37.680
Shlainte mhath!

35:39.320 --> 35:41.640
Why'd you take the child?

35:42.840 --> 35:45.160
Oh, unlike your brethren,
I got myself a conscience.

35:45.200 --> 35:49.160
Maybe cause I know what it's like
to have everything stolen from you.

35:49.200 --> 35:53.400
Now this country
offered my folks the chance to start over,

35:53.480 --> 35:55.400
that's why I fight for her.

35:55.480 --> 35:59.200
Tooth 'n nail.
Jennison Jay-Hawker during the war.

36:00.800 --> 36:02.640
-You ever heard of them?
-Union Red-leggers.

36:03.760 --> 36:06.520
-Reavers and thieves.
-Yes, sir!

36:06.600 --> 36:08.480
[laughs]

36:08.560 --> 36:13.440
You know, there's one thing
that ol' bitch taught me,

36:13.520 --> 36:17.200
you gonna win, you can't fight fair.

36:17.320 --> 36:19.480
Or kind.

36:19.560 --> 36:21.680
You have to burn and starve.

36:21.800 --> 36:24.960
Wins every time. Likewise under Sheridan.

36:26.320 --> 36:29.960
You know one winter
we torched out a village so hot,

36:31.280 --> 36:33.280
melt the snow for a mile around.

36:37.680 --> 36:40.160
But that wars is done.

36:40.200 --> 36:44.360
And I wanna see this great country
offer your people the same as mine.

36:45.680 --> 36:48.680
There's a Indian School
at the head of this line

36:48.800 --> 36:52.000
built on the proceeds of my good fortune.

36:52.080 --> 36:54.680
I regard it as a, uh...

36:54.800 --> 36:58.640
as a portal,
into which any Indian can enter

36:58.760 --> 37:02.000
but from which only Americans depart.

37:03.600 --> 37:05.600
Now, my folks, they loved the tartan

37:05.640 --> 37:08.880
just as much as yours the feather
but it's under that...

37:08.960 --> 37:11.400
that we now must all stand.

37:16.160 --> 37:18.360
I'm taking the boy to that school!

37:18.440 --> 37:19.880
New Dawn.

37:19.960 --> 37:22.040
These your students?

37:23.000 --> 37:24.040
Well, they are.

37:24.120 --> 37:28.360
Had, uh, Mable there for two years now.

37:28.440 --> 37:30.920
We only picked up Rose...

37:31.000 --> 37:33.160
not two weeks back.

37:33.200 --> 37:37.680
She's a,
she's a little quiet but she'll learn.

37:39.080 --> 37:40.520
To be your...

37:41.640 --> 37:46.080
Oh? Blue blood, thin skinned. No surprise.

37:48.440 --> 37:52.040
You, uh, you looking
a little red there, ma'am,

37:52.120 --> 37:53.920
maybe you should join my school.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.120
They're learning to be your servants?

37:56.160 --> 37:58.920
Did not Our Savior
wash the feet of his Disciples?

37:59.000 --> 38:02.600
-Do you wash theirs?
-Oh, indeed I do. Their minds.

38:02.640 --> 38:05.320
For I can see no other pathway
for the Indian's survival.

38:05.400 --> 38:07.400
There won't be one no more.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.600
Exactly! Like I ain't no Scot.

38:09.640 --> 38:12.440
-Scotland still exists.
-So does "Nebraska"!

38:13.920 --> 38:18.600
But I wouldn't expect no old world
sassenach like yourself to know that,

38:18.640 --> 38:19.680
lets alone how to say it.

38:23.200 --> 38:25.120
Mable, you may clear now.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.880
Nyi-brathge.

38:41.960 --> 38:42.760
Hmm?

38:45.480 --> 38:46.680
Nyi-brathge.

38:47.880 --> 38:49.360
Means water that is flat.

38:50.600 --> 38:51.560
It's Otoe.

38:52.640 --> 38:56.120
Yeah, Nebraska. Like I said.

38:57.480 --> 38:59.000
Nyi-brathge.

38:59.080 --> 39:02.680
Now you, you're trying to teach me some,
I gets it.

39:02.800 --> 39:07.960
You know, languages change, son.

39:08.040 --> 39:10.600
That's my whole point.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.040
So must they.

39:20.160 --> 39:21.880
Rose, come on.

39:23.760 --> 39:26.760
[dramatic music playing]

39:46.560 --> 39:48.560
Ese'he Ohvo'komaestse.

39:50.360 --> 39:54.960
Ese'he Ohvo'komaestse

39:56.600 --> 40:00.360
[Eli] I know her. We met before.

40:02.520 --> 40:04.080
Her name is Touching Ground.

40:05.440 --> 40:07.480
She's Cheyenne.

40:07.560 --> 40:09.440
She's the widow of Chief Running Hawke.

40:09.520 --> 40:11.280
[dramatic music playing]

40:22.120 --> 40:24.160
[Eli] And that boy you picked up...

40:24.280 --> 40:25.640
He's their son.

40:39.080 --> 40:40.920
I have found you.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.800
The Great Spirit has led me to you!

40:50.560 --> 40:52.760
[Eli] She was the wife
of a Cheyenne war chief.

40:52.840 --> 40:54.640
Got his head
blown off my last day of service.

40:54.760 --> 40:56.160
[Cornelia] Did you kill him?

40:56.280 --> 40:57.760
[Eli] No, but I saw it.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.360
Must be why the boy's holding back,
he saw me too.

41:03.960 --> 41:05.280
[groans]

41:05.360 --> 41:06.880
-You're burning up.
-Hmm...

41:08.640 --> 41:11.000
-They ain't stopped our exit.
-Good!

41:11.080 --> 41:12.160
-Best ride quick.
-Yes.

41:12.280 --> 41:13.400
Wait!

41:16.320 --> 41:18.840
Please!

41:18.920 --> 41:20.320
Please!

41:20.400 --> 41:22.120
[Cornelia] Ask her his name.

41:27.760 --> 41:29.440
[Eli] White Moon.

41:31.360 --> 41:32.600
Quick!

41:36.160 --> 41:39.360
[dramatic music playing]

41:44.880 --> 41:47.120
[Cornelia] No! It's all right. Come on.

41:48.160 --> 41:49.560
We've got to go.

41:55.520 --> 41:57.560
[Sergeant Ellroy] Ten Hundred Forty...

41:59.160 --> 42:01.160
Five...

42:01.200 --> 42:02.480
Fifty...

42:03.520 --> 42:04.800
Five...

42:04.880 --> 42:06.640
Seven, Seventy!

42:06.680 --> 42:08.920
Sixty-eight, seventy!

42:13.560 --> 42:15.160
-[grunts]
-[horse neighs]

42:24.000 --> 42:25.360
[Eli] The horse!

42:27.160 --> 42:29.880
[Sergeant Ellroy] I thought
you was aiming for the Countess.

42:29.960 --> 42:31.320
Thought I got her.

42:37.760 --> 42:38.920
[gunshot]

42:45.400 --> 42:46.760
Horse...

42:46.840 --> 42:51.160
[Major Mackay] Yeah.
Least now I got me a lying cow for real.

42:53.400 --> 42:56.960
And at a record breaking distance.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.640
[suspenseful music playing]

43:08.760 --> 43:10.880
A foot shy, good line.

43:14.160 --> 43:16.040
[Eli] Single shot. He has to reload.

43:16.120 --> 43:18.440
Where your money bags at? Front or back?

43:18.520 --> 43:21.120
-Both.
-Why'd you bring so much?

43:21.160 --> 43:22.760
Didn't know how much I'd need.

43:24.320 --> 43:25.600
Now you do.

43:27.120 --> 43:30.880
You see smoke from the gun,
sit the boy up. Fast.

43:30.960 --> 43:32.320
[Sergeant Ellroy]
The Indian's making a run.

43:32.400 --> 43:35.800
They always do! Stay with the boy.

43:35.880 --> 43:37.040
[gunshot]

43:39.880 --> 43:41.720
Horse...

43:41.800 --> 43:43.040
again!

43:50.520 --> 43:51.920
Getting jittery.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.560
[suspenseful music playing] [gunshot]

44:10.200 --> 44:11.680
She moved him!

44:11.760 --> 44:14.840
What? Fuck! No more! Play fair!

44:20.520 --> 44:22.920
It's all in the breathing...

44:29.520 --> 44:31.080
[Eli] Drop him!

44:42.760 --> 44:46.400
Oh, come on.

44:51.760 --> 44:55.400
No prairie-savage's out-wolfing me...

44:56.680 --> 44:58.000
No, sir!

44:58.080 --> 45:00.000
[gunshot]

45:01.680 --> 45:05.560
[suspenseful music playing]

45:44.280 --> 45:46.640
[Touching Ground chanting]

45:50.080 --> 45:51.480
All right?

46:06.400 --> 46:08.760
They are going to kill you!

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
[screams]

46:28.600 --> 46:30.840
[horse neighs]

46:30.920 --> 46:34.440

[dramatic music playing]

47:13.360 --> 47:15.520

47:20.200 --> 47:22.920
[screams]

48:01.920 --> 48:03.840
[distant gunshot]

48:03.920 --> 48:05.600
I'm so sorry.

48:19.320 --> 48:22.320
