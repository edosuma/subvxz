-Well, we don't know that anymore

and then you hung up on them,
so we don't know what the hell's going on,

than show his true feelings,

you opened your heart, you got hurt.

that's not really the point.

didn't even talk to in school.

30:16.606 --> 30:18.149

This girl.

31:41.024 --> 31:43.735
She is awesome. And what about the guy?

and he's not thinking straight.

a lot more clearly than usual.

About me being jealous and, like,
obsessed?

32:32.825 --> 32:33.660
Yeah.

32:33.743 --> 32:36.996
It isn't because I had a crush on you.

32:39.123 --> 32:40.208
It's because...

32:41.709 --> 32:43.878
she wouldn't stop staring at you.

Mrs. Click?

But... she couldn't
pull her eyes away from you

32:59.102 --> 33:02.188
and your stupid hair.

33:03.231 --> 33:05.775
And I didn't understand,
because you would get

Hey, translate.

47:57.499 --> 47:59.167
We've found the children.

They are still in the mall. Lower level.

48:03.589 --> 48:05.424
[in Russian]
Keep all entrances locked down.

48:05.507 --> 48:06.341

Keep all entrances locked down.

48:37.623 --> 48:38.540
[squeaking sound]

48:42.586 --> 48:44.129

50:12.634 --> 50:14.761
-Lucas?
-What are you doing here?

50:14.845 --> 50:16.179
Ask them. It's their fault.

50:16.263 --> 50:18.473
True, yeah. Totally true.
It's absolutely our fault.

50:18.557 --> 50:20.058
I don't understand what happened
to that car.

50:20.142 --> 50:21.184
El has superpowers.

50:21.268 --> 50:23.186
-[Robin] I'm sorry?
-Superpowers. She threw it with her mind.

50:23.270 --> 50:24.938
-C'mon, catch up.
-That's El?

50:25.022 --> 50:27.149
-Who's El?
-I'm sorry, who are you?

50:27.232 --> 50:29.901
-I'm Robin. I work with Steve.
-She cracked the top secret code.

50:29.985 --> 50:31.820
Yeah, which is how we found out
about the Russians.

50:31.903 --> 50:33.196
Russians? Wait, what Russians?

50:33.280 --> 50:35.157
-The Russians!
-Those were Russians?

50:35.240 --> 50:37.325
-Some of them.
-What are you talking about?

50:37.409 --> 50:38.827
-Didn't you hear our code red?
-Yeah.

50:38.910 --> 50:41.455
-Couldn't understand what you were saying.
-Goddamn low battery.

50:41.538 --> 50:43.540
How many times do I have to tell you
with the low battery?

50:43.623 --> 50:45.167
Well, everything worked out, didn't it?

50:45.250 --> 50:48.420
-Worked out? We almost died.
-Yeah, but we didn't, did we?

50:48.503 --> 50:51.298
-[Steve] It was pretty damn close.
-[Lucas] Okay, Russians?

50:51.381 --> 50:53.633

the Russian government?

-[Eleven panting]
-[Dustin] What are you not comprehending?

50:56.136 --> 50:57.387

-We have a full-blown  Red Dawn  situation.
-[droning sound]

51:00.223 --> 51:02.142
[Max] So this has nothing to do
with the gate?

51:02.225 --> 51:04.478
[Dustin] It has  everything  to do
with the gate...

51:04.561 --> 51:06.188
[droning sound intensifies]

51:06.271 --> 51:07.773
[Eleven grunts, groans]
