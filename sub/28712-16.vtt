WEBVTT

00:01.544 --> 00:04.973
Events, predicted centuries
before they occure.

00:04.997 --> 00:06.400
NICK POPE:
He was able to perceive

00:06.424 --> 00:10.084
the rise of Napoleon,
the rise of Hitler,

00:10.178 --> 00:13.513
atomic weapons dropped
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

00:13.673 --> 00:17.350
NARRATOR: Objects moved
with the power of the mind.

00:17.510 --> 00:19.580
Without touching it,
I'm able to control it.

00:19.604 --> 00:20.764
I can hold it over there.

00:20.855 --> 00:23.748
-I can pull it back there.
-POPE: Wow.

00:23.775 --> 00:25.419
NARRATOR:
Communications that happen

00:25.443 --> 00:27.434
without speaking a word.

00:27.529 --> 00:28.547
JOHN VIVANCO:
This thing

00:28.571 --> 00:29.571
telepathically...

00:29.689 --> 00:31.030
communicated with me,

00:31.190 --> 00:32.885
and it said,
"We are here to help you."

00:32.909 --> 00:34.909
NARRATOR:
There are many who believe

00:35.027 --> 00:37.762
that the human brain possesses
extraordinary,

00:37.789 --> 00:43.117
untapped abilities, given to us
by extraterrestrial beings.

00:43.211 --> 00:45.773
DAVID CHILDRESS: You have to wonder
if, ultimately,

00:45.797 --> 00:47.938
the goal is to activate

00:47.966 --> 00:49.865
all the humans on this planet.

00:49.926 --> 00:53.127
NARRATOR:
If true, once we learn to access

00:53.221 --> 00:55.221
the full potential of the brain,

00:55.381 --> 00:57.965
will we discover a new reality

00:58.059 --> 01:00.709
and destiny for humankind?

01:00.770 --> 01:02.915
WILLIAM HENRY: It's possible
that extraterrestrial beings

01:02.939 --> 01:04.546
are sending messages

01:04.607 --> 01:07.149
to assist us in averting
a future disaster.

01:09.153 --> 01:11.796
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:11.823 --> 01:14.315
in the universe.

01:14.409 --> 01:17.285
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:18.955 --> 01:21.396
It demands
we question everything

01:21.457 --> 01:24.141
we have ever been taught.

01:24.168 --> 01:27.569
The evidence is all around us.

01:27.630 --> 01:31.498
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:31.593 --> 01:34.427
We are not alone.

01:34.587 --> 01:37.597
We have never <i> been</i> alone.

01:45.815 --> 01:48.165
Paris, France.

01:48.192 --> 01:51.927
June 30, 1559.

01:51.988 --> 01:54.021
In a freak accident,

01:54.115 --> 01:57.691
French King Henry II
is mortally wounded

01:57.785 --> 02:00.286
-while jousting in a tournament.
-(horse neighs)

02:03.708 --> 02:06.608
Ten days later, he dies.

02:06.669 --> 02:09.610
The news shocks
the French people...

02:09.672 --> 02:12.189
except for one man:

02:12.216 --> 02:15.676
the seer, Michel de Nostradamus.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.379
♪ ♪

02:18.473 --> 02:20.640
Years earlier,
Nostradamus foretold the death

02:20.800 --> 02:23.868
of King Henry in <i> Les Proph騁ies,</i>

02:23.895 --> 02:29.131
a collection of 942 predictions
about the future.

02:29.192 --> 02:31.967
Now his macabre vision
has been realized

02:32.028 --> 02:34.236
with startling clarity.

02:35.740 --> 02:37.882
Nostradamus's fame as a prophet

02:37.909 --> 02:39.717
starts with the...

02:39.744 --> 02:41.476
prophecy that King Henry II

02:41.537 --> 02:43.663
would die
in a jousting accident.

02:43.823 --> 02:47.649
He died, as the prophecy said,
"a cruel death."

02:47.710 --> 02:51.820
The reaction to this
positively accurate prediction

02:51.881 --> 02:56.133
was masses of people
burning Nostradamus in effigy.

02:59.171 --> 03:02.497
NARRATOR:
Long after his death in 1566,

03:02.558 --> 03:05.092
Nostradamus's
most chilling prophecies

03:05.186 --> 03:08.170
became known around the world.

03:08.231 --> 03:09.991
HENRY:
He's famous today

03:10.024 --> 03:13.434
because in 1555 he predicted
the rise of Napoleon,

03:13.528 --> 03:15.085
of Adolf Hitler,

03:15.113 --> 03:17.179
of the death of Princess Diana.

03:17.240 --> 03:20.015
MITCH HOROWITZ: Nostradamus is
perhaps <i> the</i> most enduring name

03:20.076 --> 03:22.109
in post-biblical prophecy,

03:22.203 --> 03:24.704
and people continue to feel
that they can learn

03:24.864 --> 03:27.873
what's around the next corner
by studying his quatrains.

03:28.033 --> 03:30.451
HOGUE:
His prophecies are foggy,

03:30.545 --> 03:33.270
cloudy, cryptic,

03:33.297 --> 03:36.290
full of wordplays
called anagrams.

03:36.384 --> 03:40.778
He was trying to create
a difficult verse to avoid

03:40.805 --> 03:43.113
the church justices burning him.

03:43.141 --> 03:45.950
NARRATOR:
Nostradamus did not claim

03:45.977 --> 03:49.044
to have been born with
the ability to see the future.

03:49.105 --> 03:51.397
He said that this gift
came to him suddenly

03:51.557 --> 03:54.382
in his mid-40s
when he traveled Southern Europe

03:54.444 --> 03:58.053
as a physician and chemist
fighting the plague.

03:58.114 --> 04:00.464
But just what... or who...

04:00.491 --> 04:03.391
gave him the incredible ability
to see the future

04:03.453 --> 04:06.637
was a mystery even to him.

04:06.664 --> 04:09.393
HOGUE: He was single-handedly
fighting the plague,

04:09.417 --> 04:12.752
and his wife
and his two children died.

04:12.912 --> 04:15.312
He packed up his mule,
and, literally, in one night,

04:15.339 --> 04:17.164
left everything...

04:17.257 --> 04:21.317
and disappeared
from the historical chronicles

04:21.345 --> 04:23.578
for about six years.

04:23.639 --> 04:25.155
The shock, the grief,

04:25.183 --> 04:27.235
the shattering
of what had happened to him

04:27.259 --> 04:30.160
had awakened the family gift.

04:30.188 --> 04:32.087
He had an awakening experience

04:32.148 --> 04:35.516
that somehow opened up
his psychic ability.

04:35.610 --> 04:37.579
It's quite possible
that his brain itself

04:37.603 --> 04:39.261
was somehow altered,

04:39.322 --> 04:41.300
a switch was flipped,
and when he came back,

04:41.324 --> 04:43.616
he had the ability
to see into the future

04:43.776 --> 04:45.826
and to make prophecies.

04:49.448 --> 04:51.439
NARRATOR:
A psychic awakening?

04:51.501 --> 04:53.684
Is it possible
that Nostradamus's ability

04:53.711 --> 04:56.020
to predict the future
was somehow activated

04:56.047 --> 04:58.506
by the trauma he experienced?

05:00.134 --> 05:03.285
Many researchers
of extrasensory abilities

05:03.346 --> 05:06.380
believe the human brain
contains incredible potential

05:06.474 --> 05:08.974
that scientists
have not yet discovered,

05:09.134 --> 05:13.203
and which are sometimes
switched on by traumatic events.

05:13.231 --> 05:15.873
Evidence of this can be found

05:15.900 --> 05:18.375
not only
in the life of Nostradamus,

05:18.402 --> 05:23.030
but also extraordinary cases
documented in modern times.

05:26.911 --> 05:28.828
Melbourne, Australia.

05:31.082 --> 05:33.648
February 2012.

05:33.709 --> 05:37.244
21-year-old college student
Ben McMahon

05:37.338 --> 05:40.989
is driving home one afternoon
when a semitruck

05:41.050 --> 05:43.417
-runs a red light...
-(tires screeching)

05:43.511 --> 05:46.328
-(crashing)
-and broadsides his car.

05:46.389 --> 05:48.659
-(monitor beeping steadily)
-The accident leaves McMahon

05:48.683 --> 05:50.574
in a coma.

05:50.601 --> 05:52.500
When he awakens a week later,

05:52.562 --> 05:54.428
McMahon shocks everyone

05:54.522 --> 05:56.838
by speaking in fluent Mandarin,

05:56.899 --> 06:00.842
a language he only
casually studied in high school

06:00.903 --> 06:05.756
Doctors say McMahon suffers
from foreign language syndrome,

06:05.783 --> 06:09.827
a rare condition that occurs
after a traumatic brain injury.

06:11.372 --> 06:13.267
There have been
certain circumstances

06:13.291 --> 06:15.599
where people have had
an injury of the brain

06:15.626 --> 06:19.712
and then suddenly developed some
completely new, uh, ability.

06:19.872 --> 06:22.364
It's a little bit like
the savant phenomenon,

06:22.425 --> 06:26.293
where somebody has just
these unbelievable abilities

06:26.387 --> 06:29.513
in a given domain
that are kind of unexplainable.

06:31.475 --> 06:35.543
The brain is a compilation
of billions of nerve cells

06:35.605 --> 06:38.122
that work together
to help us have our thoughts,

06:38.149 --> 06:40.215
feelings and experiences.

06:40.276 --> 06:42.809
Almost everything is still
mysterious about the brain.

06:42.904 --> 06:45.237
I mean, we understand the basics
of how things work,

06:45.397 --> 06:48.240
but when it comes
to our actual feelings,

06:48.400 --> 06:51.301
our thought, our emotions,
our consciousness,

06:51.329 --> 06:53.303
we really don't have
a good answer

06:53.331 --> 06:55.322
as to how the brain helps us

06:55.416 --> 06:57.311
to have
those different experiences.

06:57.335 --> 06:59.326
NARRATOR:
People who have suffered

06:59.420 --> 07:03.071
traumatic brain injuries
have developed incredible skills

07:03.132 --> 07:05.315
such as perfect recall

07:05.343 --> 07:08.761
and advanced understanding
of mathematical concepts,

07:08.921 --> 07:12.765
and the instantaneous mastery
of musical instruments.

07:12.925 --> 07:15.601
But is it possible
that the human brain

07:15.761 --> 07:18.103
contains even more
incredible abilities

07:18.263 --> 07:20.481
just waiting to be unlocked?

07:23.102 --> 07:25.005
The untapped potentials
of the brain

07:25.029 --> 07:27.529
are barely researched yet.

07:29.441 --> 07:33.101
Those researching
creative people

07:33.162 --> 07:35.621
assume that most of the work
that is done,

07:35.781 --> 07:37.122
that is truly innovative,

07:37.282 --> 07:39.274
new, original and valuable,

07:39.335 --> 07:41.943
is done by the part
of the brain we can't track,

07:42.004 --> 07:44.279
the part that
is barely understood.

07:44.340 --> 07:47.357
CAROLINE CORY: The difference
between the average human

07:47.385 --> 07:49.526
and the prophets and the seers

07:49.553 --> 07:52.137
is not that
the prophets and seers

07:52.297 --> 07:53.955
have a different DNA.

07:54.016 --> 07:57.792
It is simply that they allow
their extrasensory perception

07:57.853 --> 08:01.038
and their abilities
to be enhanced.

08:01.065 --> 08:04.632
And that is the reason why
they receive messages

08:04.694 --> 08:06.560
from the beyond.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.882
HENRY: This speaks to the
enormous hidden capacity

08:08.906 --> 08:10.489
of the brain,

08:10.649 --> 08:12.849
and even opens up questions
of whether or not

08:12.985 --> 08:14.963
our brain capacity is
in the brain itself,

08:14.987 --> 08:16.848
or maybe it's
outside of the brain,

08:16.872 --> 08:19.814
and somehow we're able to tap
into these other abilities

08:19.875 --> 08:21.417
outside the brain.

08:22.661 --> 08:24.305
NARRATOR:
The human brain,

08:24.329 --> 08:25.838
unlike the brains of animals,

08:25.998 --> 08:28.248
contains a large neocortex,

08:28.342 --> 08:31.251
the region responsible
for language, logical reasoning

08:31.345 --> 08:33.679
and consciousness.

08:33.839 --> 08:37.057
Many believe it is also the seat
of psychic abilities.

08:38.769 --> 08:42.520
In 2015, researchers
in Germany determined

08:42.681 --> 08:45.265
that the human neocortex
only developed

08:45.359 --> 08:48.444
after it was activated
by a single gene.

08:49.947 --> 08:53.032
Around 200,000 years ago,
say neuroscientists,

08:53.192 --> 08:56.035
our neocortex
was mysteriously switched on.

08:56.195 --> 08:58.186
And nobody knows how.

08:58.247 --> 09:00.267
Of course,
ancient astronaut theory says

09:00.291 --> 09:02.266
it's extraterrestrials,

09:02.293 --> 09:04.543
that beings came from elsewhere

09:04.703 --> 09:06.937
and tweaked our DNA.

09:06.964 --> 09:09.956
This is very important,
because within the neocortex,

09:10.051 --> 09:12.442
we now know,
are precognitive abilities,

09:12.470 --> 09:14.303
psychic abilities.

09:16.215 --> 09:18.535
CHILDRESS: If we're
actually genetically engineered

09:18.559 --> 09:20.759
by extraterrestrials,
and they want us to have

09:20.886 --> 09:22.710
a certain kind of a brain,

09:22.772 --> 09:26.640
you have to wonder if,
ultimately, what the goal is

09:26.734 --> 09:30.310
with extraterrestrials is
to activate,

09:30.404 --> 09:32.571
really, all the humans
on this planet

09:32.731 --> 09:34.965
so that we're using
our brainpower

09:34.992 --> 09:38.226
and our psychic abilities.

09:38.287 --> 09:41.896
Perhaps what
the extraterrestrials did

09:41.957 --> 09:44.566
when they fashioned our DNA
and activated our neocortex

09:44.627 --> 09:47.252
was cosmic consciousness,
cosmic awareness,

09:47.412 --> 09:49.496
psychic abilities...

09:49.590 --> 09:52.925
that could potentially link us
to extraterrestrials.

09:53.085 --> 09:57.596
NARRATOR: If human DNA was fashioned
by extraterrestrials,

09:57.756 --> 10:00.507
as ancient astronaut theorists
propose,

10:00.601 --> 10:02.584
is it possible that within it

10:02.645 --> 10:05.187
lie powerful
extrasensory abilities?

10:06.598 --> 10:08.165
And have there been people

10:08.192 --> 10:10.517
who have been able
to activate these talents,

10:10.611 --> 10:13.019
whether by accident,
through practice,

10:13.114 --> 10:16.115
or by extraterrestrial
intervention?

10:16.275 --> 10:18.450
Perhaps further clues
can be found

10:18.610 --> 10:21.695
by examining
not only claims of clairvoyance,

10:21.789 --> 10:24.030
but the incredible capability
to move objects

10:24.125 --> 10:25.999
with the mind.

10:32.624 --> 10:35.041
I can feel the different
electrical sensations in my head

10:35.136 --> 10:39.379
1935.

10:39.473 --> 10:43.958
Duke University parapsychologist
Joseph Banks Rhine

10:44.019 --> 10:47.629
publishes a study that ignites
a firestorm of controversy

10:47.690 --> 10:49.723
in the scientific community.

10:49.817 --> 10:54.378
Rhine claims the brain
has psychic abilities

10:54.405 --> 10:56.897
he calls
extrasensory perception,

10:56.991 --> 11:00.567
or ESP.

11:00.661 --> 11:04.404
Parapsychology consists of five
very distinct characteristics

11:04.498 --> 11:05.647
that we study.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.148
One is telepathy,

11:07.209 --> 11:11.670
which is mind-to-mind
communication.

11:11.830 --> 11:14.748
Clairvoyance...
it's getting information

11:14.842 --> 11:17.843
about objects or events
from a distance,

11:18.003 --> 11:20.495
whether it be something that be
in a drawer in another room

11:20.556 --> 11:22.739
or even something
halfway around the world.

11:22.766 --> 11:26.852
Precognition, which is getting
information through time.

11:27.012 --> 11:29.855
Usually from the future
but sometimes from the past.

11:30.015 --> 11:34.267
We also study psychokinesis,
or mind/matter interaction.

11:34.361 --> 11:39.105
HOROWITZ:
ESP is really just the ability,

11:39.200 --> 11:41.011
or at least evidence
of the ability,

11:41.035 --> 11:45.037
to glean information
in an extrasensory manner.

11:45.197 --> 11:46.780
So we're left with a question:

11:46.874 --> 11:49.666
how is this information
being exchanged?

11:51.870 --> 11:55.025
NEWBERG: From a neuroscience perspective,
there's a lot of controversy

11:55.049 --> 11:57.129
as to whether something
like ESP exists.

11:57.209 --> 11:58.884
Is there some sensory process

11:59.044 --> 12:01.869
that our brain, uh,
is able to tap into?

12:01.931 --> 12:05.449
Uh, is our brain able
to get to some more basic level

12:05.476 --> 12:07.542
of how the universe works and

12:07.603 --> 12:11.455
can pick up what other people
are thinking or feeling?

12:11.482 --> 12:14.233
There are studies that purport
to be able to show

12:14.393 --> 12:17.385
these kinds of phenomena
as being real,

12:17.446 --> 12:20.313
and I think they need
to be taken seriously.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.742
NARRATOR: While working within the
British Ministry of Defence,

12:23.902 --> 12:26.820
Nick Pope became aware
that numerous world governments

12:26.914 --> 12:29.581
have devoted a significant
amount of time and money

12:29.741 --> 12:31.975
to studying, and even employing,

12:32.002 --> 12:35.479
people claiming to have
psychic abilities.

12:35.506 --> 12:40.317
In August 2019, he traveled
to Durham, North Carolina

12:40.344 --> 12:42.113
to visit the
Rhine Research Center.

12:42.137 --> 12:43.670
Hello.

12:43.764 --> 12:46.164
Hi, I'm John Kruth, the
executive director of the Rhine.

12:46.258 --> 12:48.236
- I'm Nick.
- Nice to meet you, Nick. Come on in with me.

12:48.260 --> 12:49.570
I have someone
I'd like you to meet.

12:49.594 --> 12:51.177
Great. Thank you.

12:51.272 --> 12:52.916
NARRATOR: John has been developing
a new method

12:52.940 --> 12:55.165
to detect and measure
psychic abilities.

12:55.192 --> 12:57.512
-Nick, this is Edd Edwards.
-Hi. Great to meet you.

12:57.602 --> 12:59.019
Good to meet you, Nick.

12:59.113 --> 13:00.748
POPE: Talk me through this.
What are we,

13:00.772 --> 13:02.676
what are we looking at
here, and, um,

13:02.700 --> 13:05.025
what are you going to do, Edd?

13:05.119 --> 13:06.638
EDWARDS:
Okay, this equipment here,

13:06.662 --> 13:08.954
what it does is pick up
the electrical energy

13:09.114 --> 13:12.182
I generate in my brain,
and I'm able to control it.

13:12.209 --> 13:13.533
How do you do that?

13:13.627 --> 13:16.870
I mean, talk me through
what you actually think.

13:16.964 --> 13:20.114
I can feel the different
electrical sensations in my head

13:20.175 --> 13:22.526
that I consciously control.

13:22.553 --> 13:24.044
Like a tingling or a...?

13:24.138 --> 13:26.880
Yeah, tingling, magnetics,
electrical sensations.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.641
And, then, out on my own,
I've learned to generate

13:29.801 --> 13:31.459
these high energies in my hands.

13:31.520 --> 13:34.629
And, for example, you know what
neuropathy is in people?

13:34.690 --> 13:36.706
Feet go numb and everything?

13:36.734 --> 13:38.800
I can apply this energy to that,

13:38.861 --> 13:41.214
and the neuropathy will clear up
in about four minutes

13:41.238 --> 13:43.380
in about eight
out of ten people.

13:43.407 --> 13:46.367
- So it's like you're activating something.
- Correct.

13:46.485 --> 13:47.962
KRUTH:
Edd talks about helping people

13:47.986 --> 13:49.806
to activate
their immune systems,

13:49.830 --> 13:52.480
helping them to deal
with physical problems.

13:52.541 --> 13:55.483
And I'm wondering what is the
mechanism behind this healing?

13:55.544 --> 13:57.985
And that's what we're gonna
be testing here, right?

13:58.047 --> 13:59.816
This is something
I can demonstrate

13:59.840 --> 14:02.007
that really
most other people can't.

14:02.167 --> 14:03.675
Right, I'd love to see this.

14:03.835 --> 14:05.302
Okay, well, let me turn it on.

14:08.057 --> 14:10.849
Okay, now I'm gonna hold
these two units right here,

14:11.009 --> 14:12.579
and all they're doing
is picking up

14:12.603 --> 14:14.539
the electrical energy
in my body.

14:14.563 --> 14:17.283
KRUTH: So,
from a scientific perspective,

14:17.349 --> 14:19.419
this machine measures
static electricity

14:19.443 --> 14:22.085
-and static fields.
-Mm-hmm.

14:22.112 --> 14:24.771
And Edd is, apparently,
generating static fields.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.001
So, if I want that thing
to go to the right,

14:27.025 --> 14:28.511
I pull on the right side
of my brain.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.110
If I want it to go on the left,

14:30.204 --> 14:32.929
I pull it on the left side
of my brain.

14:32.956 --> 14:35.009
You tell me when and I'll
pull it back to the right.

14:35.033 --> 14:37.376
So if I was to say right,

14:37.536 --> 14:40.194
you would... and left...

14:40.255 --> 14:41.255
and right again.

14:43.592 --> 14:45.236
Without these controls,
just to be clear,

14:45.260 --> 14:47.034
this doesn't move at all.

14:47.096 --> 14:49.796
If there's any ambient
static fields in the area,

14:49.890 --> 14:51.785
- it'll-it'll wiggle around a little bit.
- Yeah.

14:51.809 --> 14:53.620
One of the things we thought is,
maybe it has to do

14:53.644 --> 14:55.413
with pressure
he's exerting on it.

14:55.437 --> 14:57.470
As he increases pressure
on one side,

14:57.564 --> 14:59.898
it moves one way or the other,
but, as you can see,

15:00.058 --> 15:02.717
he can also have this effect
without touching the poles.

15:02.778 --> 15:05.373
EDWARDS: Without touching it.
I can hold it over there.

15:05.397 --> 15:08.890
I can pull it back there.

15:08.951 --> 15:12.744
Mentally, I'm just
changing polarity in my head,

15:12.904 --> 15:16.306
or going from one side
to the other.

15:16.333 --> 15:19.476
NARRATOR: Removing any physical contact
with the machine,

15:19.503 --> 15:21.920
Edd has just
demonstrated something

15:22.080 --> 15:23.922
many would consider impossible:

15:24.082 --> 15:25.924
he moved the toggle

15:26.084 --> 15:29.243
using only the power
of his mind.

15:29.304 --> 15:31.574
POPE: Sounds like
you're at the real forefront

15:31.598 --> 15:34.841
of some
cutting-edge research here.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.996
Well, it's difficult
to find people who are able

15:37.020 --> 15:39.829
to consistently have
these sorts of effects,

15:39.857 --> 15:42.182
and the fact that Edd
has consistent effects

15:42.276 --> 15:44.676
allows us to explore the
phenomena in a lot more detail.

15:45.863 --> 15:47.854
Now, at the UVA studies,

15:47.948 --> 15:51.265
they do the extensive
EEG brain mapping on me,

15:51.326 --> 15:53.677
and what they've learned
about my brain compared

15:53.704 --> 15:57.180
to all the other EEGs is just
freaking 'em out up there.

15:57.207 --> 16:00.517
Uh, my brain is operating
on all levels of consciousness

16:00.544 --> 16:02.252
all at the same time.

16:04.339 --> 16:06.523
NARRATOR:
Typically, the human brain

16:06.550 --> 16:08.800
generates specific brain waves

16:08.960 --> 16:11.285
while in different states
of consciousness.

16:11.346 --> 16:14.806
But neuroscientists who have
studied Edd's brain claim

16:14.966 --> 16:16.700
it is capable of generating all

16:16.727 --> 16:20.294
of these separate brain waves
simultaneously.

16:20.355 --> 16:23.482
NEWBERG: When it comes to the
brain waves that our brain has,

16:23.642 --> 16:26.151
we have denoted them
alpha waves,

16:26.311 --> 16:28.131
beta waves, theta waves,
and so forth.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.638
Uh, these are essentially
different frequencies,

16:30.699 --> 16:32.659
certain types
that are associated

16:32.817 --> 16:35.552
with sleep patterns
and things like that,

16:35.579 --> 16:37.465
but it-it's always been
a little difficult

16:37.489 --> 16:39.664
to know exactly how to interpret

16:39.824 --> 16:41.978
all of the different types
of brain waves that we have.

16:42.002 --> 16:44.577
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS:
An argument can be made

16:44.671 --> 16:47.506
that ESP or psychokinesis
or precognition

16:47.666 --> 16:50.509
could be where the brain reaches

16:50.669 --> 16:54.754
a level that we
are unfamiliar with.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.906
Not because it doesn't exist,

16:56.934 --> 17:00.519
but because the great majority
of people have not learned

17:00.679 --> 17:03.838
how to harness
that side of the brain.

17:03.899 --> 17:07.008
NARRATOR: Is it possible that abilities
like telepathy

17:07.069 --> 17:11.178
and psychokinesis are just
waiting to be developed?

17:11.240 --> 17:16.108
If so, is ESP something
that anyone can master?

17:16.203 --> 17:20.021
ESP is something that everyone
has to some extent.

17:20.082 --> 17:23.098
Just like any other skill
or talent you might have,

17:23.126 --> 17:26.377
whether it be a musical talent,
whether it be a sports talent,

17:26.538 --> 17:29.530
everyone has a bit
of natural abilities.

17:29.591 --> 17:32.533
But there are some people
who practice really hard.

17:32.594 --> 17:34.460
And they get better at it

17:34.555 --> 17:36.691
whether they have
the natural ability or not.

17:36.715 --> 17:38.890
CORY:
Everyone has the ability

17:39.050 --> 17:41.801
to develop their
extrasensory perception.

17:41.895 --> 17:44.304
It is because it is part
of our DNA,

17:44.398 --> 17:46.973
it is innate in the human nature

17:47.067 --> 17:50.402
to be able to tap
into other realities

17:50.562 --> 17:53.220
beyond our normal human senses.

17:53.282 --> 17:56.482
NARRATOR:
Tap into other realities?

17:56.577 --> 17:59.469
Could it be that harnessing
extrasensory abilities

17:59.496 --> 18:03.331
is the key to connecting
with extraterrestrial beings?

18:05.127 --> 18:07.327
Perhaps further clues
can be found

18:07.421 --> 18:11.381
by examining ancient stories
of the Shining Ones.

18:18.849 --> 18:20.765
POPE:
Wow.

18:23.020 --> 18:26.104
August 2019.

18:26.264 --> 18:28.848
Nick Pope is meeting

18:28.942 --> 18:30.795
with parapsychologist
John G. Kruth

18:30.819 --> 18:33.670
to observe an experiment
with Edd Edwards,

18:33.697 --> 18:37.006
a man who has demonstrated
psychokinetic abilities.

18:37.034 --> 18:40.118
John has brought Edd and Nick
to a dark room.

18:40.278 --> 18:44.105
Here, he intends to study
Edd's abilities with a device

18:44.166 --> 18:47.942
that measures individual light
particles, called photons.

18:48.003 --> 18:50.243
We have a very sensitive piece
of equipment here.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.266
It's called
a photomultiplier tube.

18:52.290 --> 18:54.633
The photomultiplier tube

18:54.793 --> 18:57.618
will measure a single photon

18:57.679 --> 19:00.029
of ultraviolet light
every half second.

19:00.057 --> 19:02.198
It's one of
the most sensitive instruments

19:02.225 --> 19:03.975
for measuring light that exists.

19:04.135 --> 19:05.371
It's used in standard
physics experiments

19:05.395 --> 19:07.128
and laser technology.

19:07.189 --> 19:10.039
The reason we have that in here
is because we're trying

19:10.067 --> 19:12.942
to measure light that comes
from the human body.

19:14.821 --> 19:18.323
CORY: The human body
naturally emits light.

19:18.483 --> 19:23.736
The average person emits
14 to 20 photons

19:23.830 --> 19:27.557
by centimeter square per second.

19:27.584 --> 19:29.650
This is very, very low.

19:29.711 --> 19:32.837
So today what we're gonna do
is we're gonna have Edd

19:32.997 --> 19:35.064
just sit like he is right now

19:35.092 --> 19:37.028
and we're gonna take
a baseline reading from him.

19:37.052 --> 19:39.511
Once we take a baseline from
him, then I'm gonna ask Edd

19:39.671 --> 19:42.013
to start doing the exercises

19:42.173 --> 19:44.318
that we were seeing downstairs,
to see if there's any change

19:44.342 --> 19:45.925
in our photon readings.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.687
NARRATOR:
In the control room,

19:48.847 --> 19:52.749
Nick and John will observe
the experiment on computers

19:52.776 --> 19:56.844
that record the amount of light
Edd produces in the dark room.

19:56.905 --> 19:59.008
So what are you actually
hoping to observe here,

19:59.032 --> 20:01.441
and how will this
tie in with ESP

20:01.535 --> 20:03.262
and parapsychology
more generally?

20:03.286 --> 20:05.278
The emission of light,

20:05.372 --> 20:07.183
if it's being projected
from him,

20:07.207 --> 20:10.858
would be a type of PK,
or psychokinesis.

20:10.919 --> 20:14.862
It may be a mechanism
that might enable ESP.

20:14.923 --> 20:19.551
And how would this tie in with
telepathy and clairvoyance?

20:19.711 --> 20:21.447
Well, when we're talking
about light,

20:21.471 --> 20:23.930
we're talking about
information carrier systems.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.633
If you think about fiber optics,

20:27.728 --> 20:29.894
how the entire Internet works,

20:30.054 --> 20:32.138
it's all done using light

20:32.232 --> 20:35.308
in different frequencies
and different patterns.

20:35.402 --> 20:38.737
And this is what we're measuring
in here, we're measuring light.

20:40.574 --> 20:43.408
So it's possible
that the light being modulated

20:43.568 --> 20:45.818
can be what the carrier signal
could be

20:45.912 --> 20:48.580
for the information
being transferred in ESP.

20:48.740 --> 20:50.156
All right. About ready?

20:50.250 --> 20:51.477
-Yes.
-Okay.

20:51.501 --> 20:54.252
-Hey, Edd?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

20:54.412 --> 20:56.737
All right,
I'm gonna turn the lights off

20:56.798 --> 20:57.589
so we can start the study.

20:57.749 --> 20:59.591
<i>Okay.</i>

20:59.751 --> 21:02.001
NARRATOR:
John kills the lights

21:02.095 --> 21:04.095
and begins the experiment.

21:04.255 --> 21:08.491
Edd is going to attempt to
generate energy with his mind.

21:08.518 --> 21:12.328
But first John will record
a baseline measurement.

21:12.355 --> 21:14.575
KRUTH: And you can see we're starting
to take readings now.

21:14.599 --> 21:16.423
POPE:
Typically,

21:16.485 --> 21:18.588
what would you expect to see
in this experiment?

21:18.612 --> 21:21.687
So, what we typically see is,

21:21.782 --> 21:24.524
we'll see a baseline, which kind
of wiggles around a little bit.

21:24.618 --> 21:27.786
It'll usually be
between 12 and 20 photons

21:27.946 --> 21:29.954
that we'll see
moving back and forth.

21:30.114 --> 21:32.092
If we get it to go beyond it
to a point

21:32.116 --> 21:34.517
where it's two times
the baseline or higher...

21:34.544 --> 21:36.981
- Uh-huh.
- ...then that's extremely significant.

21:37.005 --> 21:38.858
- So that's what we're looking for.
- Okay.

21:38.882 --> 21:41.190
NARRATOR: With their baseline
readings complete,

21:41.218 --> 21:44.803
John starts the next phase
of the experiment.

21:44.963 --> 21:47.972
Okay, Edd, you can start
your sitting session.

21:48.132 --> 21:49.808
<i>Okay.</i>

21:51.302 --> 21:53.627
NARRATOR:
Edd begins his process

21:53.688 --> 21:54.979
to generate energy.

21:55.139 --> 21:56.539
And, almost immediately,

21:56.566 --> 21:58.391
the computer readings change.

21:58.485 --> 21:59.670
KRUTH:
Oh, look.

21:59.694 --> 22:01.214
-That one jumped up to 156.
-Oh, wow.

22:01.238 --> 22:03.212
Now we're seeing 105.

22:03.240 --> 22:05.384

1995.

26:32.509 --> 26:36.669
The U.S. government declassifies
the Stargate Project,

26:36.763 --> 26:38.321
a secret Army unit

26:38.348 --> 26:40.489
that employed people
with psychic abilities

26:40.517 --> 26:42.934
as spies.

26:51.653 --> 26:54.862
a practice called
remote viewing.

During the 1970s,

26:57.775 --> 27:00.025
President Jimmy Carter's
administration

27:00.120 --> 27:02.102
used remote viewers to locate

John Vivanco has been

27:19.055 --> 27:22.623
a remote viewer
for over 20 years.

27:22.684 --> 27:26.126
VIVANCO:
I worked with corporations, uh,

27:26.187 --> 27:28.448
as a professional remote viewer
on these projects.

27:28.472 --> 27:30.648
Corporations, intelligence,

27:30.808 --> 27:33.943
uh, counterterror
for the FBI after 9/11.

27:35.646 --> 27:38.639
Remote viewing fits into ESP.

27:38.700 --> 27:41.159
But remote viewing
is also kind of like the, uh,

27:41.319 --> 27:44.495
Swiss Army knife
of psychic functioning,

27:44.655 --> 27:50.001
because it kind of uses all of
these different aspects of ESP

27:50.161 --> 27:52.201
in order to get information
on things.

27:53.548 --> 27:55.359
NARRATOR:
A key part of remote viewing

27:55.383 --> 27:58.401
involves entering
a trance-like state,

27:58.428 --> 28:01.995
which John does
by listening to specific sounds.

28:02.056 --> 28:04.073
We have brain waves.

28:04.100 --> 28:08.669
And in the thinking, monkey-mind
state that w-we're normally in,

28:08.730 --> 28:10.429
that is beta.

28:10.523 --> 28:13.173
If you think about an EEG,

28:13.234 --> 28:14.995
there's very high peaks
and valleys...

28:15.019 --> 28:17.010
da-da-da-da-da-da-da...
moving fast.

28:17.071 --> 28:19.846
That's not a very good place
to remote-view from.

28:19.908 --> 28:22.258
So, when we listen
to the binaural beats,

28:22.285 --> 28:24.276
they move us down into alpha,

28:24.370 --> 28:26.173
which is a little bit slower
and meditative,

28:26.197 --> 28:28.539
and also down into theta.

28:28.699 --> 28:32.359
And we-we like to stay
in the alpha to the theta zone,

28:32.420 --> 28:36.130
using that tool in order to get
the best information.

28:38.801 --> 28:40.885
CORY:
During a trance state,

28:41.045 --> 28:42.948
the brain begins to relax,
going down

28:42.972 --> 28:46.799
from beta to theta
to alpha state,

28:46.893 --> 28:50.228
which is between four
and eight hertz.

28:50.388 --> 28:53.213
Prophets and seers

28:53.274 --> 28:57.050
tap into the theta layer
of reality,

28:57.111 --> 28:59.795
where they are
extremely relaxed,

28:59.822 --> 29:03.241
which allows them
to receive visions and imagery

29:03.401 --> 29:05.868
beyond the normal
human perception.

29:07.497 --> 29:10.217
NARRATOR: While working
as a remote viewer,

29:10.241 --> 29:14.735
Vivanco claims to have gathered
more than just information.

29:14.796 --> 29:18.481
He has also encountered
otherworldly beings.

29:18.508 --> 29:21.408
I'm at home, and...

29:21.469 --> 29:23.469
I'm having this crazy dream.

29:24.639 --> 29:27.156
So I open my eyes,

29:27.183 --> 29:29.934
I sit up and there's this thing,

29:30.094 --> 29:33.662
I'd say, like,
six feet away from me.

29:33.690 --> 29:37.775
It's got a head shaped
like a-a football on the side,

29:37.935 --> 29:39.593
two eyes.

29:39.654 --> 29:43.856
It's got
these sort of spindly legs.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.469
So I start backing up,
and I'm starting to go,

29:45.493 --> 29:46.951
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."

29:47.111 --> 29:50.604
And it telepathically
communicated with me.

29:50.665 --> 29:53.699
And they said,
"We are here to help you,

29:53.793 --> 29:55.868
and we want you to help us."

29:55.962 --> 29:58.440
NARRATOR: John was not
the only remote viewer

29:58.464 --> 30:00.631
on his team
to have such an experience.

30:00.791 --> 30:04.043
VIVANCO:
Now, the other viewers started

30:04.137 --> 30:05.469
to experience the same thing.

30:05.629 --> 30:07.533
And so that's
when we started to,

30:07.557 --> 30:10.474
"Okay, now, you know,
I'm not hallucinating."

30:10.634 --> 30:13.144
NARRATOR:
It is not

30:13.304 --> 30:15.124
only remote viewers
who have reported

30:15.148 --> 30:18.858
telepathic communication
with otherworldly beings.

30:21.029 --> 30:22.486
In the ancient world,

30:22.646 --> 30:25.138
priests and seers
developed various methods

30:25.199 --> 30:27.219
to enter an altered state
of consciousness

30:27.243 --> 30:29.976
to connect with their gods.

30:30.038 --> 30:34.573
In Ireland, Celtic shaman
rhythmically banged on drums.

30:34.667 --> 30:38.318
The famous Greek seer,
the Oracle of Delphi,

30:38.379 --> 30:42.298
would inhale a noxious gas
and go into an ecstatic dance.

30:44.886 --> 30:49.496
Perhaps the most curious tale
comes from ancient China,

30:49.557 --> 30:52.241
where Taoist priests would
practice a mystic dance ritual

30:52.268 --> 30:54.760
called the Pace of Yu.

30:54.854 --> 30:57.913
DOMINIC STEAVU: The Pace of Yu
is a mediumistic trance

30:57.940 --> 30:59.915
that enables practitioners

30:59.942 --> 31:02.768
to escape the normal confines

31:02.862 --> 31:05.087
of time and space
and travel to the stars

31:05.114 --> 31:08.181
in order to communicate

31:08.242 --> 31:10.534
with the divine beings
that inhabit them.

31:10.694 --> 31:14.763
And there, they would interact
with various astral deities

31:14.791 --> 31:18.267
and stellar powers
or stellar divinities in order

31:18.294 --> 31:23.196
to directly ask them for advice
about future events.

31:23.257 --> 31:27.051
NARRATOR: Astral deities
with stellar powers?

31:27.211 --> 31:29.945
Might the priests
have been communicating

31:29.972 --> 31:31.797
with extraterrestrials?

31:31.891 --> 31:34.392
CHILDRESS:
With these trancelike states,

31:34.552 --> 31:38.621
the whole idea is
to really contact the gods

31:38.648 --> 31:40.623
and higher beings.

31:40.650 --> 31:44.402
And are you perhaps
contacting extraterrestrials?

31:48.065 --> 31:49.865
NARRATOR:
In modern times,

31:49.900 --> 31:51.940
powerful leaders
from Winston Churchill

31:52.069 --> 31:54.728
to Ronald Reagan sought counsel
from people

31:54.789 --> 31:57.081
with psychic abilities
for all types of decisions.

31:57.241 --> 31:59.141
POPE:
What leader

31:59.168 --> 32:03.328
wouldn't benefit from knowing
what lies around the corner,

32:03.423 --> 32:05.589
whether it's good news
or bad news,

32:05.749 --> 32:08.592
and perhaps have the opportunity

32:08.752 --> 32:12.154
to try to prevent
something catastrophic

32:12.181 --> 32:13.556
from happening on their watch?

32:15.977 --> 32:20.012
So I think this is just
a continuation of something

32:20.106 --> 32:23.691
that has been with us
since the dawn of civilization.

32:25.778 --> 32:27.673
NARRATOR:
If psychics have been steering

32:27.697 --> 32:30.522
the highest affairs of a nation,
might they be part

32:30.616 --> 32:32.599
of an extraterrestrial agenda

32:32.660 --> 32:35.027
to direct the course of life
on Earth?

32:35.121 --> 32:37.121
But if so,

32:37.281 --> 32:40.273
how could otherworldly beings
know the future?

32:40.334 --> 32:44.128
Perhaps clues can be found
not within the mind,

32:44.288 --> 32:46.881
but from far beyond
our known universe.

32:51.804 --> 32:54.472
HENRY:
These seers and prophets are,

32:54.632 --> 32:57.049
author Michael Talbot
publishes the book,

32:57.143 --> 32:59.143
<i>The Holographic Universe.</i>

32:59.303 --> 33:03.481
In it, Talbot proposes that the
universe is like a hologram...

33:03.641 --> 33:08.210
an image or scene produced
by a photographic projection.

33:08.237 --> 33:10.395
In a holographic universe,

33:10.490 --> 33:13.974
all the information...
past, present and future...

33:14.035 --> 33:17.328
exists all at once.

33:17.488 --> 33:19.299
CHILDRESS: Within
this holographic universe,

33:19.323 --> 33:21.665
your own past lives

33:21.825 --> 33:24.727
and future lives
have already happened.

33:24.754 --> 33:27.654
Everything is contained there.

33:27.715 --> 33:31.750
So with the ability to tap
into the holographic universe,

33:31.844 --> 33:35.754
you can see the past,
you could see the future,

33:35.848 --> 33:39.183
and you would know
what's going to happen next.

33:39.343 --> 33:41.260
NARRATOR:
In Western cultures,

33:41.354 --> 33:43.687
where time is seen
as a linear progress,

33:43.847 --> 33:46.098
the concept
of a holographic universe

33:46.192 --> 33:48.842
may seem like science fiction.

33:48.903 --> 33:52.087
But numerous cultures,
both ancient and modern,

33:52.114 --> 33:54.273
believe that time is cyclical

33:54.367 --> 33:57.350
and repeats itself
on an endless loop.

33:57.411 --> 34:00.262
Buddhist and Hindu beliefs
refer to this cycle

34:00.289 --> 34:01.872
as Kalachakra.

34:02.032 --> 34:04.767
The notion of Kalachakra refers
to this idea

34:04.794 --> 34:06.710
that there is a synchronicity

34:06.870 --> 34:10.621
between various cycles
in the universe.

34:10.716 --> 34:13.699
There is the large,
cosmic time cycle,

34:13.761 --> 34:16.887
which is then synchronized
with other cycles

34:17.047 --> 34:19.614
that go from
the rotation of planets

34:19.641 --> 34:22.375
all the way to seasons.

34:22.436 --> 34:24.803
So all of these cycles
are interconnected

34:24.897 --> 34:27.139
in this great circular motion

34:27.233 --> 34:30.609
which goes back
to a circular notion of time.

34:31.987 --> 34:34.054
Many religious stories speak

34:34.114 --> 34:36.723
of a place outside of time.

34:36.784 --> 34:40.226
Perhaps one could travel
outside of time

34:40.288 --> 34:42.246
and back into time,

34:42.406 --> 34:46.475
later or earlier.

34:46.502 --> 34:49.402
It makes the concept
of time travel workable.

34:49.463 --> 34:51.404
NARRATOR:
Time travel?

34:51.465 --> 34:53.482
A place outside of time?

34:53.509 --> 34:56.168
Could the concepts of past,

34:56.262 --> 34:59.004
present and future only exist

34:59.098 --> 35:01.173
from a person's perspective,

35:01.267 --> 35:04.493
moving through space and time?

35:04.520 --> 35:06.845
And if all moments in time

35:06.939 --> 35:09.089
are actually
happening simultaneously,

35:09.150 --> 35:11.108
might the mind be able

35:11.268 --> 35:13.352
to see beyond the specific point
in time

35:13.446 --> 35:15.529
in which it physically exists?

35:17.158 --> 35:19.766
Some ancient astronaut theorists
believe

35:19.827 --> 35:22.286
that extraterrestrials designed
the human brain

35:22.446 --> 35:24.938
with other,
even more extraordinary

35:24.999 --> 35:28.851
extrasensory abilities
we have yet to discover.

35:28.878 --> 35:31.128
TSOUKALOS:
In the 1970s,

35:31.288 --> 35:35.466
this French philosopher by the
name of Dr. Jean Charon proposed

35:35.626 --> 35:38.360
that each
and every single particle

35:38.387 --> 35:41.697
that's in existence
throughout the entire universe

35:41.724 --> 35:45.792
contains the entire knowledge

35:45.853 --> 35:47.811
of the universe.

35:47.971 --> 35:49.708
He called that
"the eternal spirit."

35:49.732 --> 35:51.874
And he said...

35:51.901 --> 35:55.060
and this is my favorite quote
of the entire book...

35:55.154 --> 35:59.806
that the brain
is the last untamed beast

35:59.867 --> 36:01.867
in the universe.

36:05.155 --> 36:07.147
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

36:07.208 --> 36:09.500
that the next step
in human evolution depends

36:09.660 --> 36:11.727
not on our mastery
of technology,

36:11.754 --> 36:15.339
but on the mastery
of our own minds?

36:15.499 --> 36:18.491
Will our ascension
into the stars come

36:18.552 --> 36:21.920
not through physics,
but something more?

36:22.014 --> 36:24.089
CORY:
We think

36:24.183 --> 36:28.168
that we need a machine
to make us more intelligent,

36:28.229 --> 36:32.005
to make us more superior
and enhance our ability,

36:32.066 --> 36:35.100
but you have access
to certain powers

36:35.194 --> 36:38.862
and capabilities
way beyond the machinery.

36:39.022 --> 36:41.423
The human brain has the ability

36:41.450 --> 36:44.276
to communicate
with other beings,

36:44.370 --> 36:47.112
other dimensions and realities.

36:47.206 --> 36:51.283
Some people believe
that the prophets and seers

36:51.377 --> 36:55.195
may have a hybrid
extraterrestrial lineage,

36:55.256 --> 36:59.216
but I believe that everyone
has this capability.

36:59.376 --> 37:03.612
The way to evolve is
through consciousness.

37:03.639 --> 37:05.872
Consciousness is more powerful

37:05.933 --> 37:08.976
and more important
than machinery and A.I.

37:10.396 --> 37:12.356
NARRATOR:
Is it humanity's destiny

37:12.398 --> 37:14.623
to master psychic abilities

37:14.650 --> 37:17.976
that could put us in contact
with other intelligent beings

37:18.070 --> 37:21.146
and lead
to our ascension from Earth?

37:21.240 --> 37:23.632
There are some who believe

37:23.659 --> 37:26.985
that a man who harnessed
these abilities centuries ago...

37:27.079 --> 37:31.306
Michel de Nostradamus...
left a warning

37:31.333 --> 37:32.808
for future generations

37:32.835 --> 37:35.919
that this extrasensory evolution
may be critical

37:36.079 --> 37:38.163
to the survival...

37:38.257 --> 37:40.132
of humankind.

37:50.936 --> 37:53.290
NARRATOR: A solar flare erupts
from a powerful storm

37:53.314 --> 37:55.105
on the surface of the Sun

37:55.265 --> 37:57.849
and hurtles towards Earth.

37:57.943 --> 38:00.836
Due to the tilt of the planet
on this particular day,

38:00.863 --> 38:05.007
we barely miss bombardment
by the apocalyptic flame.

38:05.034 --> 38:08.026
Had it happened
one week earlier,

38:08.120 --> 38:11.938
humans would have faced
a global catastrophe.

38:11.999 --> 38:15.851
Now, scientists say,
it could happen again.

38:15.878 --> 38:18.444
And next time,

38:18.506 --> 38:21.423
a solar flare could strike
a fatal blow.

38:23.385 --> 38:27.546
Remarkably,
over five centuries ago,

38:27.640 --> 38:29.807
Michel de Nostradamus
made a prediction

38:29.967 --> 38:31.883
about the end of life on Earth

38:31.977 --> 38:34.052
that to many sounds
eerily similar

38:34.146 --> 38:36.563
to the potential effects
of a solar flare.

38:37.975 --> 38:40.651
Nostradamus has made

38:40.811 --> 38:44.971
one of the farthest future-dated
prophecies in history.

38:45.032 --> 38:48.141
The fire sears
and dries out and destroys

38:48.202 --> 38:50.138
and desiccates the surface
of the Earth,

38:50.162 --> 38:52.721
destroying all life
on its surface.

38:52.748 --> 38:54.406
But then he gives some hope.

38:54.500 --> 38:57.893
He says but the races
of humanity will go on.

38:57.920 --> 38:59.911
And then he makes a statement

39:00.005 --> 39:03.489
that he never has made
in any of his utterances.

39:03.551 --> 39:07.344
He starts using
astrological identifications

39:07.504 --> 39:10.330
for places in space,
as locations.

39:10.391 --> 39:14.593
He says some will go
to Aquarius for a few years.

39:14.687 --> 39:17.354
Others will go
to the constellation of Cancer.

39:17.514 --> 39:20.357
It's a hint of a man
from the 16th century

39:20.517 --> 39:23.251
trying to grasp the concept

39:23.279 --> 39:27.589
of the galactic stage
of human civilization.

39:27.616 --> 39:29.536
TSOUKALOS:
The idea that somebody

39:29.693 --> 39:33.111
from around 500 years ago said

39:33.205 --> 39:35.688
that we'll have
to leave planet Earth

39:35.749 --> 39:39.101
in order to live elsewhere
to continue life...

39:39.128 --> 39:41.119
that's incredibly fascinating,

39:41.213 --> 39:44.439
because what does a man
from 500 years ago

39:44.466 --> 39:48.793
know about leaving planet Earth?

39:48.888 --> 39:51.116
NARRATOR: Could Nostradamus
have been warned

39:51.140 --> 39:54.966
about a future catastrophe
by otherworldly beings?

39:55.060 --> 39:57.636
And might they be
shepherding humanity

39:57.730 --> 40:00.789
until we unlock
the full potential of our brain

40:00.816 --> 40:04.717
and become Shining Ones
like them?

40:04.778 --> 40:08.630
Other extraterrestrial
civilizations are going to focus

40:08.657 --> 40:13.485
on consciousness, on making
their bodies into light.

40:13.579 --> 40:16.396
When you become a light body,

40:16.457 --> 40:19.157
you have access
to certain powers

40:19.251 --> 40:22.644
and capabilities
way beyond the machinery.

40:22.671 --> 40:25.088
Humanity is evolving,

40:25.248 --> 40:28.241
we are advancing
our consciousness, and

40:28.302 --> 40:31.987
it is consciousness
that directs your thoughts.

40:32.014 --> 40:35.748
It is consciousness
that can manage your body.

40:35.809 --> 40:38.176
And consciousness
has the ability

40:38.270 --> 40:42.422
to communicate
directly with machinery,

40:42.483 --> 40:46.334
anything that contains
artificial intelligence.

40:46.362 --> 40:48.632
There have been a number
of studies that have shown

40:48.656 --> 40:51.114
that consciousness seems
to be able to go beyond

40:51.274 --> 40:53.175
just what is in the human brain,

40:53.202 --> 40:55.088
and that is something
that I think

40:55.112 --> 40:57.788
all of us need to think about.

40:57.948 --> 41:01.016
What the future holds
remains to be seen,

41:01.043 --> 41:02.608
but one argument is

41:02.670 --> 41:04.944
that the development
of psychic abilities

41:05.005 --> 41:08.523
is going to be the next step
of human evolution.

41:08.550 --> 41:11.617
That unlocking these abilities

41:11.679 --> 41:15.880
that perhaps lie dormant
within all of us is going

41:15.975 --> 41:20.035
to be the key to upgrading
humanity to the next level.

41:20.062 --> 41:21.942
HENRY:
It seems quite possible

41:21.981 --> 41:23.647
that as we evolve,

41:23.807 --> 41:25.710
our psychic abilities
will also evolve,

41:25.734 --> 41:27.286
and that maybe
our ultimate destiny

41:27.310 --> 41:29.486
is to become telepathic beings

41:29.646 --> 41:31.846
like what we see
with these extraterrestrials.

41:33.993 --> 41:37.052
NARRATOR:
Could it be that one day soon

41:37.079 --> 41:40.905
all humans will be able to tap
into incredible abilities

41:41.000 --> 41:44.650
that lie dormant
within the brain?

41:44.712 --> 41:48.321
Will we be able to move objects
with our minds,

41:48.382 --> 41:52.342
communicate telepathically,

41:52.502 --> 41:55.904
and even see into the future?

41:55.931 --> 42:00.075
Perhaps once we reach a new
level of psychic awareness,

42:00.102 --> 42:04.670
we will be able to both see
and realize our destiny

42:04.732 --> 42:06.748
in the stars.
