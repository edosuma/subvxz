Yoo-hoo!

23:06.152 --> 23:08.421
I think somebody parked
in my spot.

23:08.455 --> 23:10.557
Be a lamb and move it
for me, will ya?

23:10.590 --> 23:11.591
Ow.

23:11.624 --> 23:12.925
Ah, e-excuse me.
C-can I help you?

23:12.959 --> 23:15.361
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:15.394 --> 23:18.097
I'm Cattie Goodman.
I'm your new principal.

23:18.130 --> 23:21.133
C-C-Cattie G-Goodman?

23:21.167 --> 23:22.535
The district fixer?

23:22.569 --> 23:25.237
Aw, well, I do what I can.
[ Laughs]

23:25.271 --> 23:27.306
And now I'm here
to fix up Smoot.

23:27.339 --> 23:29.809
Well, just one second.
Tammy was actually right --

23:29.842 --> 23:31.644
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

23:31.678 --> 23:32.879
Shh!

23:32.912 --> 23:34.581
I think what Tammy
was actually about to say

23:34.614 --> 23:35.815
is how excited we are...

23:35.848 --> 23:37.049
Exactly.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.785
...as teachers and how
in need of real change

23:38.818 --> 23:40.086
we are here at Smoot.

23:40.119 --> 23:43.456
Actually I was in the middle
of firing these boys.

23:43.490 --> 23:44.591
Oh.

23:44.624 --> 23:47.494
Well, in that case,
I just have to ask.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.228
Whatever gave you the idea

23:49.261 --> 23:51.798
that you were in control
of personnel?

23:51.831 --> 23:54.834
I me-- oh, oh honey.
Honey.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.769
you didn't think they were
gonna let a secretary

23:56.803 --> 23:59.271
become the permanent principal,
now did ya?

23:59.305 --> 24:00.907
[ Chuckling ] Oh.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.509
But you don't know what
these guys have done!

24:02.542 --> 24:05.344
Darling, at every new school
I reform,

24:05.377 --> 24:07.514
I start off with
a clean slate policy.

24:07.547 --> 24:10.850
That's so funny 'cause Tammy
has this clean plate policy.

24:10.883 --> 24:15.688
[ Laughs ] Boom,
I'm back in the game!

24:15.722 --> 24:17.657
Why don't you get to
stepping right there.

24:17.690 --> 24:19.692
Hey, maybe you could get
some hot water for me,

24:19.726 --> 24:20.760
for my chamomile tea.

24:20.793 --> 24:23.830
There you go. Thank ya.
I appreciate it.

24:23.863 --> 24:25.865
A little quicker,
a little quicker.

24:25.898 --> 24:28.367
And so our dance continues,
Tam-Tam.

24:28.400 --> 24:31.704
No, no, no.
This has just begun.

24:31.738 --> 24:33.806
[ Sighs ] Psht.

24:33.840 --> 24:36.743
She should get one of those
that says goodbye.
