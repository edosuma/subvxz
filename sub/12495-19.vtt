WEBVTT

00:09.625 --> 00:12.417
<i>And they have a minibar</i>

00:09.625 --> 00:12.417
<i>with all kinds of fun snacks.</i>

00:12.458 --> 00:15.417
<i>And look at all these</i>

00:12.458 --> 00:15.417
<i>free soaps and lotions</i>

00:12.458 --> 00:15.417
<i>they leave in the bathroom.</i>

00:15.458 --> 00:17.542
Oh, wow, hang on.

00:17.583 --> 00:19.834
-I got to pause for a sec.

00:17.583 --> 00:19.834
<i>-I--</i>

00:19.875 --> 00:23.917
Henry, please come

00:19.875 --> 00:23.917
video chat with Dad!

00:23.959 --> 00:26.083
No, we're doing

00:23.959 --> 00:26.083
a science project for school!

00:26.125 --> 00:31.000
But I'm trying to text Marla

00:26.125 --> 00:31.000
and Dad keeps talking

00:26.125 --> 00:31.000
about his dumb hotel.

00:31.041 --> 00:32.500
Sorry.

00:35.458 --> 00:37.500
<i>This lotion smells like</i>

00:35.458 --> 00:37.500
<i>summer squash.</i>

00:37.542 --> 00:40.667
<i>- And this lotion</i>

00:37.542 --> 00:40.667
<i>smells like coconut.</i>

00:37.542 --> 00:40.667
- (sighs)

00:40.709 --> 00:43.542
Okay, now we take the egg

00:40.709 --> 00:43.542
and shake it thusly.

00:43.583 --> 00:45.458
- Yeah, shake that egg!

00:43.583 --> 00:45.458
- Shake that egg!

00:45.500 --> 00:47.750
Shake it, baby!

00:45.500 --> 00:47.750
Scramble that unborn chicken!

00:47.792 --> 00:49.291
- Woo. Yeah.

00:49.333 --> 00:51.458
<i>So, do you guys miss me?</i>

00:53.291 --> 00:55.041
<i>Piper, are you listening to me?</i>

00:55.083 --> 00:56.792
Oh, you need to go?

00:56.834 --> 00:58.959
<i>No!</i>

01:04.000 --> 01:08.125
- Man, I've never seen anyone

01:04.000 --> 01:08.125
sweat so much.

01:08.166 --> 01:10.208
It runs in my family.

01:10.250 --> 01:12.917
My mom sweats in her sleep.

01:12.959 --> 01:13.959
(timer beeps)

01:14.000 --> 01:17.709
- Okay, time's up.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.709
-(groans)

01:17.750 --> 01:20.959
Now, it says

01:17.750 --> 01:20.959
to turn on the power

01:21.000 --> 01:23.458
and then put the egg

01:21.000 --> 01:23.458
on the electrometer.

01:25.625 --> 01:28.291
- Okay.

01:25.625 --> 01:28.291
- (electrical humming)

01:28.333 --> 01:30.500
Now what?

01:30.542 --> 01:31.583
We wait.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.500
See?

01:33.542 --> 01:35.917
The egg is already starting

01:33.542 --> 01:35.917
to smell kind of--

01:41.500 --> 01:44.875
- Was it supposed to do that?

01:41.500 --> 01:44.875
- No it was not supposed

01:41.500 --> 01:44.875
to do that!

01:46.917 --> 01:49.291
I'm all right!

01:46.917 --> 01:49.291
It's okay! I'm fine!

01:49.333 --> 01:50.792
Nobody freak out!

01:52.750 --> 01:55.291
<i>Piper, was that your mother?</i>

01:52.750 --> 01:55.291
<i>What's going on?</i>

01:55.333 --> 01:57.125
You guys, I was attacked!

01:57.166 --> 01:59.542
- What?

01:57.166 --> 01:59.542
<i>- (Dad) Did she say attacked?</i>

01:59.583 --> 02:01.750
- What happened?

01:59.583 --> 02:01.750
- Are you okay?

02:01.792 --> 02:03.333
- Yeah, yeah,

02:01.792 --> 02:03.333
I wasn't hurt or anything.

02:01.792 --> 02:03.333
-<i> Piper, your mother sounds</i>

02:01.792 --> 02:03.333
<i>upset.</i>

02:03.375 --> 02:06.375
But I was walking to my

02:03.375 --> 02:06.375
car and a man jumped out from a

02:03.375 --> 02:06.375
bush

02:06.417 --> 02:07.583
and he snatched my purse.

02:07.625 --> 02:09.000
- No way!

02:07.625 --> 02:09.000
- Whoa, that's so bad!

02:09.041 --> 02:12.875
<i>Where are you taking me?</i>

02:09.041 --> 02:12.875
<i>I don't see your mother!</i>

02:12.917 --> 02:14.583
<i>Piper!</i>

02:14.625 --> 02:16.333
Did you call the cops?

02:16.375 --> 02:20.417
Yes, I gave them

02:16.375 --> 02:20.417
a description of the guy,

02:16.375 --> 02:20.417
I filed a report.

02:20.458 --> 02:22.000
Why is jasper so sweaty?

02:23.125 --> 02:24.750
I shook an egg.

02:25.458 --> 02:27.583
Oh.

02:27.625 --> 02:29.208
Well, I'm sorry

02:27.625 --> 02:29.208
you lost your purse.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.125
Me too.

02:30.166 --> 02:32.041
I lost my phone,

02:30.166 --> 02:32.041
and my wallet,

02:32.083 --> 02:34.208
oh, and my Yotally Togurt

02:32.083 --> 02:34.208
punch card.

02:34.250 --> 02:36.083
- No way!

02:34.250 --> 02:36.083
- What?

02:36.125 --> 02:38.291
Yeah, I know,

02:36.125 --> 02:38.291
and I was just one punch away

02:36.125 --> 02:38.291
from a free medium yogurt.

02:38.333 --> 02:39.917
- (all groan)

02:38.333 --> 02:39.917
- Aw!

02:39.959 --> 02:44.166
<i>Piper?</i>

02:39.959 --> 02:44.166
<i>I can't see or hear you!</i>

02:46.417 --> 02:48.458
<i>Oh, Yerzok. Hi.</i>

02:48.500 --> 02:50.792
<i>Will you please</i>

02:48.500 --> 02:50.792
<i>go inside and get my wife?</i>

02:50.834 --> 02:53.417
How are you on computer?

02:53.458 --> 02:57.375
<i>This is a video chat.</i>

02:53.458 --> 02:57.375
<i>I'm in Baltimore.</i>

02:57.417 --> 02:58.792
<i>Now, please go get my wife.</i>

02:58.834 --> 03:01.875
- You can see me?

02:58.834 --> 03:01.875
<i>- Yes, I can see you.</i>

03:01.917 --> 03:03.583
I show you my belly.

03:03.625 --> 03:05.667
<i>No. No, Yerzok.</i>

03:05.709 --> 03:07.667
<i>No. Bad. Put it away.</i>

03:07.709 --> 03:09.250
<i>Don't show me your belly.</i>

03:09.291 --> 03:12.333
<i>No, don't put it</i>

03:09.291 --> 03:12.333
<i>against the screen!</i>

03:12.375 --> 03:15.834
<i>Aw, why would you do that?</i>

03:16.917 --> 03:18.000
It all just kind of happened.

03:18.041 --> 03:20.667
My dad was

03:18.041 --> 03:20.667
an irresponsible scientist.

03:20.709 --> 03:22.083
I wanted an after school job.

03:22.125 --> 03:25.417
And by accident,

03:22.125 --> 03:25.417
he made me indestructible.

03:25.458 --> 03:27.041
Ah!

03:27.083 --> 03:30.625
I went into this crazy store

03:27.083 --> 03:30.625
and met a pretty

03:27.083 --> 03:30.625
interesting guy.

03:30.667 --> 03:32.291
I'm going to blow your mind.

03:32.333 --> 03:35.000
Now I protect

03:32.333 --> 03:35.000
the good citizens of Swellview

03:35.041 --> 03:37.083
- who call me...

03:35.041 --> 03:37.083
- And he turned out to be...

03:37.125 --> 03:39.291
- You know the name.

03:37.125 --> 03:39.291
- Captain Man!

03:39.333 --> 03:40.500
That's right, Henry.

03:40.542 --> 03:42.917
In time, I realized

03:40.542 --> 03:42.917
that being a superhero

03:42.959 --> 03:44.458
is a lot to handle alone.

03:44.500 --> 03:45.667
He wanted some help.

03:45.709 --> 03:47.291
I needed a sidekick.

03:47.333 --> 03:48.458
I, Henry Hart...

03:48.500 --> 03:50.041
Pledge to never ever ever

03:48.500 --> 03:50.041
tell anyone...

03:50.083 --> 03:51.500
That I'm Captain Man's

03:50.083 --> 03:51.500
secret sidekick.

03:51.542 --> 03:52.792
It is done.

03:52.834 --> 03:54.250
Now we blow bubbles.

03:54.291 --> 03:55.333
And fight crime.

03:55.375 --> 03:56.875
Feels good.

04:11.000 --> 04:11.709
Call it.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.750
Up the tube!

04:14.458 --> 04:15.375
Oh, my boot!

04:15.417 --> 04:17.000
Ha!

04:18.458 --> 04:20.750
♪

04:20.792 --> 04:23.250
Ray! Hurry up!

04:23.291 --> 04:25.125
Yeah, what's up, Gooch?

04:25.166 --> 04:27.667
Look at this antique chair

04:25.166 --> 04:27.667
I got.

04:27.709 --> 04:29.875
- (chuckles)

04:27.709 --> 04:29.875
- Okay.

04:29.917 --> 04:34.208
It's one of the very first

04:29.917 --> 04:34.208
vibrating massage chairs

04:29.917 --> 04:34.208
ever made.

04:34.792 --> 04:36.333
Okay.

04:36.375 --> 04:39.417
Will you help me fix it up

04:36.375 --> 04:39.417
so I can relax my back?

04:39.458 --> 04:40.750
No.

04:40.792 --> 04:42.792
- Hey, guys.

04:40.792 --> 04:42.792
- Hello, Henry.

04:42.834 --> 04:44.500
Whoa, I didn't think

04:42.834 --> 04:44.500
you were working today.

04:44.542 --> 04:46.333
I'm not, but I got

04:44.542 --> 04:46.333
to go downstairs

04:44.542 --> 04:46.333
and check the crime computer.

04:46.375 --> 04:47.709
There's been a purse snatching.

04:47.750 --> 04:48.875
Oh, just file

04:47.750 --> 04:48.875
a police report.

04:48.917 --> 04:51.083
- Who got her purse snatched?

04:48.917 --> 04:51.083
- My mom.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.542
Your mom?

04:51.125 --> 04:53.542
Wait, what happened?

04:53.583 --> 04:56.375
Is she okay? Was she hurt?

04:53.583 --> 04:56.375
What happened? Is she okay?

04:56.417 --> 04:58.917
Why are you so interested

04:56.417 --> 04:58.917
in his mom?

04:58.959 --> 05:00.500
Have you seen his mom?

05:01.667 --> 05:03.542
We got to help her.

05:03.583 --> 05:06.333
Ray, I'm sure Henry's father

05:03.583 --> 05:06.333
is taking good care of her.

05:06.375 --> 05:08.709
Nah, my dad's out of town.

05:08.750 --> 05:11.125
He's out of town?

05:11.166 --> 05:12.625
Yeah, but I can

05:11.166 --> 05:12.625
handle things.

05:12.667 --> 05:13.959
No you can't.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.208
- Why can't I?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.208
- You're but a boy.

05:15.250 --> 05:18.542
Maybe, but I'm almost

05:15.250 --> 05:18.542
14 years old,

05:18.583 --> 05:19.834
and I've been your sidekick

05:18.583 --> 05:19.834
long enough that I can--

05:19.875 --> 05:22.208
He's just leaving

05:19.875 --> 05:22.208
while I'm talking.

05:23.834 --> 05:26.041
This chair vibrates.

05:26.709 --> 05:28.500
Okay.

05:31.792 --> 05:34.959
And when this bad man

05:31.792 --> 05:34.959
snatched your purse,

05:35.000 --> 05:36.375
did he say any words?

05:36.417 --> 05:40.208
Yes. he said,

05:36.417 --> 05:40.208
"Give me that purse, woman."

05:40.250 --> 05:43.125
"Give me that purse, woman."

05:43.792 --> 05:45.250
Captain Man, over here.

05:46.291 --> 05:48.208
Great, now look surprised.

05:49.166 --> 05:51.083
Cool. Now, duck face.

05:52.041 --> 05:54.291
Piper, will you stop?

05:55.834 --> 05:59.583
Oh, Henry, look who heard

05:55.834 --> 05:59.583
about my purse and came to help.

06:01.125 --> 06:02.583
Wow.

06:02.625 --> 06:04.000
Captain Man.

06:04.041 --> 06:07.583
In our house... again.

06:07.625 --> 06:09.834
My son, Henry.

06:09.875 --> 06:12.250
Ah, yes, I remember.

06:13.166 --> 06:15.583
So, why are you here?

06:15.625 --> 06:18.083
- To protect your mother.

06:15.625 --> 06:18.083
- And me.

06:18.125 --> 06:19.375
Yeah, sure.

06:19.417 --> 06:20.959
Protect her from what?

06:21.000 --> 06:24.041
Well, whoever snatched

06:21.000 --> 06:24.041
her purse also has everything

06:24.083 --> 06:25.417
that was inside that purse.

06:25.458 --> 06:28.834
I told him

06:25.458 --> 06:28.834
about the yogurt coupon.

06:28.875 --> 06:32.166
Right, and the criminal also

06:28.875 --> 06:32.166
has your mom's driver's license

06:32.208 --> 06:34.792
- and that means

06:32.208 --> 06:34.792
he has this address.

06:32.208 --> 06:34.792
- And my keys.

06:34.834 --> 06:38.333
- So?

06:34.834 --> 06:38.333
- Captain Man says he might

06:34.834 --> 06:38.333
come here to the house

06:34.834 --> 06:38.333
and break in.

06:38.375 --> 06:40.959
That's very true.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.208
Can I make you

06:41.000 --> 06:43.208
some hot cocoa?

06:43.250 --> 06:46.083
Look, we appreciate

06:43.250 --> 06:46.083
your help,

06:46.125 --> 06:50.125
but if the guy who took

06:46.125 --> 06:50.125
her purse does come here,

06:46.125 --> 06:50.125
I can handle him.

06:50.166 --> 06:52.041
Really?

06:50.166 --> 06:52.041
What if he does this?

06:52.083 --> 06:55.291
What?! Hey, hey, hey!

06:52.083 --> 06:55.291
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:55.333 --> 06:57.583
What are you doing?

06:57.625 --> 06:59.625
I'm pretending

06:57.625 --> 06:59.625
to be the bad guy

06:59.667 --> 07:01.542
who has just broken

06:59.667 --> 07:01.542
into this house

07:01.583 --> 07:04.583
and is now sitting

07:01.583 --> 07:04.583
on your head.

07:04.625 --> 07:08.917
Ha. Come on, Henry, show us

07:04.625 --> 07:08.917
how you'd protect us now.

07:08.959 --> 07:10.125
Please get off my head.

07:10.166 --> 07:12.208
No, I will not get off

07:10.166 --> 07:12.208
your head.

07:12.250 --> 07:15.625
That's what a bad guy

07:12.250 --> 07:15.625
might say in this situation.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.333
I don't think

07:15.667 --> 07:17.333
this would ever really happen.

07:17.375 --> 07:19.625
Oh, yes, it would.

07:19.667 --> 07:23.542
As a superhero, I see this kind

07:19.667 --> 07:23.542
of thing happen every day.

07:23.583 --> 07:25.917
No one's going

07:23.583 --> 07:25.917
to sit on my head.

07:25.959 --> 07:27.458
I'm sitting on your head.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.458
Well, I wish you'd stop.

07:33.041 --> 07:36.000
Ha, your hair's all smushed.

07:36.041 --> 07:39.500
Mrs. Hart, when does your

07:36.041 --> 07:39.500
husband return from Baltimore?

07:39.542 --> 07:40.959
Not until Monday.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.750
Hmm.

07:42.792 --> 07:44.625
All right, I'll do it.

07:44.667 --> 07:45.959
Do what?

07:46.000 --> 07:49.208
Stay here

07:46.000 --> 07:49.208
until your daddy comes home.

07:49.250 --> 07:51.542
- No way.

07:49.250 --> 07:51.542
- Wow, thanks.

07:51.583 --> 07:55.542
- Can Kid Danger

07:51.583 --> 07:55.542
come stay with us, too?

07:51.583 --> 07:55.542
- No.

07:55.583 --> 07:56.875
I mean, I mean,

07:55.583 --> 07:56.875
I mean, no.

07:56.917 --> 07:58.959
I mean, I don't think so.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.291
Can he? He probably can't.

08:01.125 --> 08:02.709
No, no, no.

08:02.750 --> 08:03.750
Why not?

08:03.792 --> 08:06.291
Because...

08:06.333 --> 08:09.500
Kid Danger

08:06.333 --> 08:09.500
is starring in a musical.

08:09.542 --> 08:11.792
- Really?

08:09.542 --> 08:11.792
- A play?

08:11.834 --> 08:13.625
A musical play.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.417
Are you sure?

08:15.458 --> 08:18.792
Because I've never heard about

08:15.458 --> 08:18.792
Kid Danger being in musicals.

08:18.834 --> 08:22.458
Oh, yeah.

08:18.834 --> 08:22.458
He's playing Annie.

08:22.500 --> 08:26.875
Oh, how Kid Danger loves

08:22.500 --> 08:26.875
to sing songs and dance about.

08:26.917 --> 08:29.166
Aw, that's adorable.

08:29.208 --> 08:31.417
Yeah.

08:33.959 --> 08:36.333
♪

08:40.875 --> 08:42.542
Ah, Henry.

08:42.583 --> 08:44.959
I was worried you were going

08:42.583 --> 08:44.959
to sleep the whole day away.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.542
I just like to sleep late

08:45.000 --> 08:48.542
on Saturdays.

08:48.583 --> 08:49.750
What's all this junk?

08:49.792 --> 08:51.667
I went to the Home Shack

08:49.792 --> 08:51.667
and got some stuff.

08:51.709 --> 08:52.834
Why?

08:52.875 --> 08:54.417
Because your dad's

08:52.875 --> 08:54.417
out of town

08:54.458 --> 08:58.458
and so I figured I'd take care

08:54.458 --> 08:58.458
of some things around the house.

08:58.500 --> 09:01.709
Look. New toilet seats

08:58.500 --> 09:01.709
for the whole family.

09:03.291 --> 09:04.333
(in high voice) Hi, Henry.

09:04.375 --> 09:08.417
Pretty soon

09:04.375 --> 09:08.417
you can sit on me.

09:08.458 --> 09:09.917
You know,

09:08.458 --> 09:09.917
you're a grown man.

09:09.959 --> 09:11.750
Yeah, well...

09:11.792 --> 09:14.875
Anyway, I thought you were

09:11.792 --> 09:14.875
just here to protect us

09:14.917 --> 09:18.291
in case the purse thief shows up

09:14.917 --> 09:18.291
and tries to sit on my head.

09:19.709 --> 09:22.291
Henry, isn't there

09:19.709 --> 09:22.291
something else

09:22.333 --> 09:24.500
that we should

09:22.333 --> 09:24.500
be talking about?

09:26.125 --> 09:27.458
Like?

09:27.500 --> 09:29.125
Like this report card

09:27.500 --> 09:29.125
that came in the mail today?

09:29.166 --> 09:31.041
Ah, geez.

09:31.083 --> 09:34.333
I notice you got a C-plus

09:31.083 --> 09:34.333
in social studies.

09:34.375 --> 09:37.083
You know, you're not being

09:34.375 --> 09:37.083
very cool right now.

09:37.125 --> 09:39.709
- You know what is very cool?

09:37.125 --> 09:39.709
- What?

09:39.750 --> 09:42.917
Getting good grades.

09:42.959 --> 09:46.041
Yeah, great. Thanks for

09:42.959 --> 09:46.041
the talk, it really

09:42.959 --> 09:46.041
turned me around. Bye.

09:46.083 --> 09:48.291
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:46.083 --> 09:48.291
Where you going?

09:48.333 --> 09:50.125
To see a movie

09:48.333 --> 09:50.125
with Jasper and Charlotte.

09:50.166 --> 09:51.792
What movie?

09:50.166 --> 09:51.792
It better be rated G.

09:51.834 --> 09:53.667
- Dude.

09:51.834 --> 09:53.667
- I mean it.

09:53.709 --> 09:56.291
No bad words, no mild violence,

09:53.709 --> 09:56.291
and especially no brief nudity.

09:56.333 --> 09:57.875
Oh, my god.

09:59.375 --> 10:01.000
- Don't bother him.

09:59.375 --> 10:01.000
- Captain Man!

10:01.041 --> 10:03.959
- Ugh.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.875
I can't believe

10:04.000 --> 10:05.875
you're really here!

10:05.917 --> 10:07.542
Why'd you tell Jasper

10:05.917 --> 10:07.542
he's at my house?

10:07.583 --> 10:11.291
I didn't. Piper's been posting

10:07.583 --> 10:11.291
pics of him all over the web.

10:11.333 --> 10:13.875
Hey, maybe after you're done

10:11.333 --> 10:13.875
protecting Henry's mom,

10:13.917 --> 10:15.125
you can come over

10:13.917 --> 10:15.125
to my house.

10:15.166 --> 10:17.667
Uh... sure.

10:15.166 --> 10:17.667
Just text me your address.

10:17.709 --> 10:19.917
Okay.

10:17.709 --> 10:19.917
What's your phone number?

10:19.959 --> 10:22.333
Oh, it's...

10:22.375 --> 10:26.667
594 Triangle Slash Blue.

10:27.709 --> 10:29.792
Got it. Wait.

10:29.834 --> 10:32.208
Hey, you guys,

10:29.834 --> 10:32.208
what are we all doing for lunch?

10:32.250 --> 10:33.375
I got plans.

10:33.417 --> 10:35.500
I thought maybe

10:33.417 --> 10:35.500
we could go out for lunch.

10:35.542 --> 10:36.750
Ooh, that sounds fun.

10:36.792 --> 10:38.125
Doesn't it?

10:38.166 --> 10:40.500
Uh, we're going to be late

10:38.166 --> 10:40.500
for the movie.

10:40.542 --> 10:41.625
Yeah, let's go.

10:41.667 --> 10:45.750
Ho, ho, ho, hold on there,

10:41.667 --> 10:45.750
plaid shirt.

10:45.792 --> 10:48.792
- What?

10:45.792 --> 10:48.792
- Don't you have

10:45.792 --> 10:48.792
a social studies test on Monday?

10:48.834 --> 10:50.291
- No.

10:48.834 --> 10:50.291
- Yeah we do.

10:50.333 --> 10:52.583
Jasper.

10:52.625 --> 10:54.917
I think your mother and I

10:52.625 --> 10:54.917
feel it would be best

10:54.959 --> 10:56.417
if you stayed home

10:54.959 --> 10:56.417
and studied.

10:56.458 --> 10:57.750
What? Mom.

10:57.792 --> 11:00.458
I don't think we should argue

10:57.792 --> 11:00.458
with a superhero.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.542
Come on, I don't want to

11:00.500 --> 11:02.542
study on a Saturday.

11:02.583 --> 11:04.458
(clicks teeth)

11:04.500 --> 11:08.000
Am I going to have to sit

11:04.500 --> 11:08.000
on somebody's head again?

11:08.041 --> 11:10.417
Hey. You're not the boss

11:08.041 --> 11:10.417
of me, okay?

11:10.458 --> 11:12.792
- Well...

11:12.834 --> 11:14.625
Whatever.

11:14.667 --> 11:17.667
You're not my dad and you're not

11:14.667 --> 11:17.667
allowed to sit on my head.

11:23.333 --> 11:26.291
(groans) Okay, I'll stay home

11:23.333 --> 11:26.291
and study!

11:26.333 --> 11:28.417
- You promise?

11:26.333 --> 11:28.417
- Yes.

11:28.458 --> 11:31.375
Now, please get your butt

11:28.458 --> 11:31.375
out of my ear.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.875
♪

11:43.333 --> 11:45.125
Mm. This orange juice

11:43.333 --> 11:45.125
is so good.

11:45.166 --> 11:47.834
Of course it is.

11:45.166 --> 11:47.834
I squeezed it myself.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.834
(laughs)

11:47.875 --> 11:50.834
Hey, Piper, hurry up!

11:50.875 --> 11:52.875
Captain Man

11:50.875 --> 11:52.875
is making us breakfast!

11:52.917 --> 11:55.125
- I'll be down

11:52.917 --> 11:55.125
in a few minutes!

11:55.166 --> 11:59.250
So...

11:55.166 --> 11:59.250
who's ready for some mancakes?

11:59.291 --> 12:02.125
- Wow. They have

11:59.291 --> 12:02.125
the Captain Man logo.

12:02.166 --> 12:05.875
- Yeah. That's what puts the man

12:02.166 --> 12:05.875
in the mancakes.

12:05.917 --> 12:07.959
(laughs)

12:08.000 --> 12:10.667
Hey.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.667
What's going on down here?

12:10.709 --> 12:12.000
- Oh, Henry, look.

12:12.041 --> 12:14.542
Captain Man made breakfast

12:12.041 --> 12:14.542
for the whole family.

12:14.583 --> 12:17.000
Oh.

12:18.041 --> 12:20.208
Uh, isn't that dad's robe?

12:21.500 --> 12:23.208
Yeah, I found it

12:21.500 --> 12:23.208
in the dryer.

12:23.250 --> 12:26.250
It looks like

12:23.250 --> 12:26.250
it fits you perfectly.

12:26.291 --> 12:28.208
Well, it's a little small

12:26.291 --> 12:28.208
in the biceps,

12:28.250 --> 12:31.291
but what can you do?

12:31.333 --> 12:36.166
Uh, you could wear your own robe

12:31.333 --> 12:36.166
and sleep at your own place.

12:36.208 --> 12:37.959
Henry, don't be rude.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.542
Captain Man is being nice enough

12:38.000 --> 12:40.542
to stay here and protect us

12:40.583 --> 12:43.375
in case that purse snatcher

12:40.583 --> 12:43.375
comes to the house.

12:43.417 --> 12:48.250
Oh yeah, the purse snatcher.

12:48.291 --> 12:51.166
So, what have you been doing

12:48.291 --> 12:51.166
to catch him?

12:52.750 --> 12:54.041
I have a lot of good ideas.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.750
- Like what?

12:54.875 --> 12:57.750
- What?

12:57.792 --> 13:00.667
What ideas do you have

12:57.792 --> 13:00.667
to catch the purse snatcher?

13:00.709 --> 13:04.458
Well, for starters, you know,

13:00.709 --> 13:04.458
I have a sidekick, Kid Danger?

13:04.500 --> 13:05.709
Oh, yeah, I've heard of him.

13:05.750 --> 13:08.834
Well, since

13:05.750 --> 13:08.834
I'm Kid Danger's boss,

13:08.875 --> 13:10.917
Maybe I'll make him

13:08.875 --> 13:10.917
put on a pretty dress

13:10.959 --> 13:14.709
and carry a purse

13:10.959 --> 13:14.709
through the most dangerous

13:10.959 --> 13:14.709
part of town late at night.

13:14.750 --> 13:19.208
And maybe the snatcher will

13:14.750 --> 13:19.208
take the bait and attack him.

13:19.250 --> 13:22.125
I... I don't think

13:19.250 --> 13:22.125
that's a very good idea.

13:22.166 --> 13:25.917
Okay, so you want to keep

13:22.166 --> 13:25.917
talking about this

13:25.959 --> 13:29.291
or you want to sit down

13:25.959 --> 13:29.291
and enjoy some mancakes?

13:29.333 --> 13:31.000
Mancakes, please.

13:34.125 --> 13:37.041
Hey, I heard on the radio

13:34.125 --> 13:37.041
they're doing family portraits

13:37.083 --> 13:38.500
at the mall today

13:37.083 --> 13:38.500
for half off.

13:38.542 --> 13:42.834
Ooh, maybe we should

13:38.542 --> 13:42.834
go get some family photos.

13:42.875 --> 13:44.583
I think

13:42.875 --> 13:44.583
that's a mantastic idea.

13:44.625 --> 13:46.083
(chuckles)

13:46.125 --> 13:48.625
Piper, put on something cute!

13:48.667 --> 13:50.917
We're going to take

13:48.667 --> 13:50.917
some family photos!

13:50.959 --> 13:52.125
Okay!

13:52.166 --> 13:52.959
Hey.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.458
Dad's in Baltimore.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.625
I know, but Captain Man

13:54.500 --> 13:57.625
can fill in for your dad.

13:58.583 --> 14:01.166
Oh no.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.208
No, no, no.

14:02.250 --> 14:04.333
Okay.

14:11.083 --> 14:14.333
Geez, how much gasoline do we

14:11.083 --> 14:14.333
have to pour into this thing?

14:14.375 --> 14:15.917
I think that's enough.

14:15.959 --> 14:17.625
Now, let's test it.

14:17.667 --> 14:19.875
Sit in the chair.

14:19.917 --> 14:22.208
How about you sit

14:19.917 --> 14:22.208
in the chair?

14:23.375 --> 14:24.750
It's totally safe.

14:24.792 --> 14:27.166
I hope so.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.625
Ready?

14:30.458 --> 14:33.125
(sputtering)

14:38.083 --> 14:40.041
- (loud thud)

14:38.083 --> 14:40.041
- (elevator dings)

14:43.834 --> 14:44.792
Hi, everyone.

14:44.834 --> 14:47.291
We're busy.

14:47.333 --> 14:51.208
- What are you wearing?

14:47.333 --> 14:51.208
- A poncho. And rubber boots.

14:53.125 --> 14:55.542
Why?

14:53.125 --> 14:55.542
It was just barely raining.

14:55.583 --> 14:56.917
I know that,

14:56.959 --> 14:59.750
but Captain Dad still made me

14:56.959 --> 14:59.750
wear all this stuff

14:59.792 --> 15:01.709
"so I won't catch a cold."

15:02.917 --> 15:05.000
And he made me carry this.

15:07.250 --> 15:10.375
Hey, I might have some

15:07.250 --> 15:10.375
good news for you. Come here.

15:11.375 --> 15:12.458
What?

15:12.500 --> 15:14.375
I was thinking about

15:12.500 --> 15:14.375
your mom's purse,

15:14.417 --> 15:16.834
So I went online,

15:14.417 --> 15:16.834
and look what I found for sale.

15:18.208 --> 15:19.375
Whoa,

15:18.208 --> 15:19.375
that's my mom's purse.

15:19.417 --> 15:22.083
That's what I thought.

15:19.417 --> 15:22.083
Here, I'll zoom in.

15:23.750 --> 15:26.500
(Henry)

15:23.750 --> 15:26.500
"Used Kate Spod purse.

15:26.542 --> 15:28.875
Recently stolen."

15:28.917 --> 15:32.333
- You'd think they wouldn't

15:28.917 --> 15:32.333
put that in the ad.

15:28.917 --> 15:32.333
- Right?

15:32.375 --> 15:33.625
So, what's our plan?

15:33.667 --> 15:34.709
Well...

15:34.750 --> 15:37.000
(chair sputtering)

15:41.750 --> 15:43.375
We call the phone number

15:41.750 --> 15:43.375
on that ad,

15:43.417 --> 15:44.875
say we want to buy the purse,

15:44.917 --> 15:47.792
and have the guy who's selling

15:44.917 --> 15:47.792
it bring it to your house,

15:47.834 --> 15:49.417
and then Captain Man

15:47.834 --> 15:49.417
can get him.

15:49.458 --> 15:52.792
Yeah, and then Captain Man

15:49.458 --> 15:52.792
can move out of my house.

15:52.834 --> 15:54.500
- Uh-huh.

15:52.834 --> 15:54.500
- (chair sputtering)

15:54.542 --> 15:55.834
(engine starts)

15:55.875 --> 15:58.375
It started! Quick!

16:00.250 --> 16:02.166
(engine backfires)

16:03.667 --> 16:05.166
Dang it!

16:13.375 --> 16:16.917
You know, one time my dad

16:13.375 --> 16:16.917
tried to braid my hair.

16:16.959 --> 16:19.291
Oh yeah?

16:16.959 --> 16:19.291
How'd that turn out?

16:19.333 --> 16:20.875
Bad!

16:21.875 --> 16:24.291
Okay, guys, how's it look?

16:25.709 --> 16:27.583
That looks fantastic.

16:27.625 --> 16:29.083
I love it!

16:30.166 --> 16:32.041
- Hi, everyone!

16:30.166 --> 16:32.041
- It's us!

16:32.083 --> 16:33.500
Did a guy named Axel

16:32.083 --> 16:33.500
show up here yet?

16:33.542 --> 16:36.083
- Axel?

16:33.542 --> 16:36.083
- No one's shown up here.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.208
- (sighs) Good.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.208
- Who's Axel?

16:37.250 --> 16:40.291
He's the guy who--

16:37.250 --> 16:40.291
What the--

16:40.333 --> 16:43.917
Really?

16:40.333 --> 16:43.917
Over the fireplace? Really?

16:44.875 --> 16:46.291
Who's Axel?

16:46.333 --> 16:48.208
The guy who stole

16:46.333 --> 16:48.208
your mom's purse.

16:48.250 --> 16:49.625
(gasps) You found him?

16:49.667 --> 16:52.000
Yeah. We found him

16:49.667 --> 16:52.000
trying to sell it online.

16:52.041 --> 16:55.041
- I found it. I found it.

16:52.041 --> 16:55.041
- We found it. All right.

16:55.083 --> 16:57.250
He's on his way here

16:55.083 --> 16:57.250
with the purse.

16:57.291 --> 16:58.750
Because he thinks

16:57.291 --> 16:58.750
we're going to buy it from him.

16:58.792 --> 17:00.250
Ooh, well, what time

16:58.792 --> 17:00.250
is he supposed to--

17:00.291 --> 17:02.166
- (doorbell rings)

17:00.291 --> 17:02.166
- (screaming)

17:02.208 --> 17:04.542
- He's here.

17:02.208 --> 17:04.542
- Quick, what's the plan?

17:04.583 --> 17:08.875
Uh... We all sneak out

17:04.583 --> 17:08.875
the back way and go to the zoo.

17:08.917 --> 17:11.041
How does that help his mom

17:08.917 --> 17:11.041
get her purse back?

17:11.083 --> 17:12.667
(doorbell rings)

17:12.709 --> 17:13.834
Just a sec!

17:13.875 --> 17:16.125
- Go hide.

17:13.875 --> 17:16.125
- All right!

17:16.166 --> 17:19.792
- Okay. Everyone just sit

17:16.166 --> 17:19.792
around and act like

17:16.166 --> 17:19.792
Everything's normal.

17:19.834 --> 17:20.834
- Right.

17:19.834 --> 17:20.834
- Okay.

17:23.458 --> 17:26.625
Wait.

17:23.458 --> 17:26.625
What if he recognizes me?

17:26.667 --> 17:27.917
She's right!

17:27.959 --> 17:30.250
Quick, you better

17:27.959 --> 17:30.250
come hide here right by me!

17:31.417 --> 17:33.208
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!

17:31.417 --> 17:33.208
- Okay!

17:34.917 --> 17:36.417
(doorbell rings)

17:38.458 --> 17:42.125
Hi, welcome to this house.

17:38.458 --> 17:42.125
Won't you come in?

17:43.000 --> 17:44.208
Yeah, okay.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.250
So...

17:47.333 --> 17:49.250
How much for the purse?

17:49.291 --> 17:51.166
Oh. Well, the ad said--

17:53.250 --> 17:54.792
Ha! Now you don't have it!

17:54.834 --> 17:57.125
- Dude--

17:54.834 --> 17:57.125
- Captain Man!

17:59.125 --> 18:01.083
Aw, no way!

18:01.125 --> 18:03.125
Captain Man lives here?

18:03.166 --> 18:04.500
No, he does not.

18:05.709 --> 18:07.709
Whatever, man.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.375
I guess I'm busted.

18:09.417 --> 18:10.625
Yeah.

18:10.667 --> 18:13.417
Which means

18:10.667 --> 18:13.417
you get your purse back.

18:13.458 --> 18:15.750
And Captain Man doesn't have

18:13.458 --> 18:15.750
to stay here anymore.

18:15.792 --> 18:18.625
Now, now, wait, wait,

18:15.792 --> 18:18.625
wait a minute.

18:18.667 --> 18:21.500
We can't be sure

18:18.667 --> 18:21.500
he's the real criminal.

18:21.542 --> 18:23.792
I am.

18:23.834 --> 18:26.667
It was all me, man.

18:26.709 --> 18:29.000
Can I see that

18:26.709 --> 18:29.000
for a second?

18:32.083 --> 18:33.333
Come with me.

18:40.208 --> 18:44.291
Now, I want you to hold on

18:40.208 --> 18:44.291
to that purse and don't escape.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.375
Because if you escape,

18:44.333 --> 18:46.375
I might not be able

18:46.417 --> 18:50.625
to find you again

18:46.417 --> 18:50.625
and take you to jail.

18:50.667 --> 18:52.250
No one's going

18:50.667 --> 18:52.250
to be watching you.

18:55.166 --> 18:59.500
You're going to leave him

18:55.166 --> 18:59.500
out there with the purse?

18:59.542 --> 19:03.208
Look, I realize it may seem

18:59.542 --> 19:03.208
like this case is solved,

19:03.250 --> 19:05.500
but just to be safe,

19:05.542 --> 19:07.709
maybe I should stay here

19:05.542 --> 19:07.709
for another month or two.

19:11.709 --> 19:13.375
Okay, that's it.

19:13.417 --> 19:16.542
Captain man, I don't mean

19:13.417 --> 19:16.542
to be disrespectful,

19:16.583 --> 19:19.000
But I think you just want

19:16.583 --> 19:19.000
to stay here and pretend

19:19.041 --> 19:20.792
to be the dad

19:19.041 --> 19:20.792
in our family.

19:20.834 --> 19:22.458
Henry, be nice.

19:22.500 --> 19:26.333
No, no.

19:22.500 --> 19:26.333
Ma'am, your boy's right.

19:28.083 --> 19:33.500
I love being a superhero,

19:28.083 --> 19:33.500
having all these cool devices,

19:33.542 --> 19:36.125
wearing this snug suit

19:33.542 --> 19:36.125
that makes me look awesome.

19:37.417 --> 19:39.667
But sometimes I get lonely.

19:39.709 --> 19:43.125
And over these past few days,

19:39.709 --> 19:43.125
I guess I got carried away

19:43.166 --> 19:46.458
with how nice it feels

19:43.166 --> 19:46.458
to be part of a real family.

19:51.041 --> 19:53.959
Aw, man, the dude ran away.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.458
Well, go get him.

19:56.291 --> 19:58.083
- Me?

19:56.291 --> 19:58.083
- Hurry.

19:58.125 --> 20:01.291
(all talking at once)

20:01.333 --> 20:03.625
...ruining it.

20:08.500 --> 20:09.667
Henry...

20:12.000 --> 20:13.333
Piper...

20:17.083 --> 20:19.208
Mom...

20:20.750 --> 20:24.458
I really enjoyed these last

20:20.750 --> 20:24.458
few days of being a family man.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.625
- Thank you for that.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.625
- (chuckles)

20:26.667 --> 20:29.333
Well, maybe one day

20:26.667 --> 20:29.333
you'll find a nice girl,

20:29.375 --> 20:33.166
get married,

20:29.375 --> 20:33.166
and have your own family.

20:34.917 --> 20:36.291
Nah.

20:38.834 --> 20:40.709
- Hey.

20:38.834 --> 20:40.709
- (honking)

20:40.750 --> 20:45.125
Did I just see Charlotte

20:40.750 --> 20:45.125
tackling a grown man

20:40.750 --> 20:45.125
out in the street?

20:45.166 --> 20:46.834
- Dad!

20:45.166 --> 20:46.834
- Honey, you're home!

20:46.875 --> 20:49.875
Yay.

20:49.917 --> 20:52.208
I thought you were going

20:49.917 --> 20:52.208
to pick me up from the airport.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.625
What's Captain Man

20:52.250 --> 20:54.625
doing here?

20:54.667 --> 20:57.166
We ran into a little problem

20:54.667 --> 20:57.166
when you were out of town.

20:57.208 --> 21:00.291
Captain Man wore your robe.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.291
My robe?

21:02.333 --> 21:04.041
Why would he--

21:04.083 --> 21:07.458
Uh... When was that taken?

21:07.500 --> 21:10.250
Uh...

21:12.208 --> 21:14.667
Well...

21:14.709 --> 21:15.709
I caught him.

21:16.834 --> 21:18.417
You're welcome.

21:23.625 --> 21:25.750
Okay, I think I fixed it.

21:25.792 --> 21:28.583
Charlotte,

21:25.792 --> 21:28.583
go sit in the chair.

21:28.625 --> 21:29.709
No.

21:29.750 --> 21:32.000
Henry, go sit in the chair.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.667
All right.

21:36.333 --> 21:41.208
- Okay. Get ready to relax

21:36.333 --> 21:41.208
and enjoy the ultimate massage.

21:41.250 --> 21:42.583
(engine starts)

21:42.625 --> 21:45.125
Oh, yes.

21:55.750 --> 21:57.208
This is nice.

22:05.500 --> 22:07.333
♪

22:32.959 --> 22:33.959
(oven bell)

22:34.000 --> 22:35.750
Mmm...
