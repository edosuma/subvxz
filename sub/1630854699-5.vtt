WEBVTT

00:17.559 --> 00:19.561
-Breathe, Freydis.

00:23.398 --> 00:24.899
-Breathe.
-Don't touch me!

00:24.983 --> 00:26.192
It's almost time!

00:29.821 --> 00:31.406
Breathe, Freydis.

00:32.407 --> 00:33.742
Let's lie you down.

00:33.825 --> 00:34.743
Freydis.

00:35.827 --> 00:37.871
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

00:37.954 --> 00:39.330
Guards!

00:45.045 --> 00:47.464
Murderers! I don't trust you!

01:08.526 --> 01:10.236
Freydis, let me help you.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.832
You are here now, Freydis,
but you must let us help you.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.292
I need nothing from you.

01:24.876 --> 01:27.587
You want the newborn
to be safe, don't you?

01:27.670 --> 01:31.091
We are safe. The gods will protect us.

01:31.174 --> 01:33.676
Leave. Leave!

02:54.340 --> 02:56.551
Arabic is
the language of scholars.

02:57.135 --> 03:00.096
It is exact so that scholars
across the known world

03:00.180 --> 03:06.227
can exchange ideas, debate,
and argue without ambiguity.

03:10.940 --> 03:16.446
When you can
understand this, you can open all doors…

03:17.739 --> 03:21.993
Even those that are difficult to open?

03:25.788 --> 03:28.458
You are learning faster than I expected.

03:31.961 --> 03:33.213
We hit something!

03:36.424 --> 03:37.467
What's wrong?

03:37.550 --> 03:39.761
The rudder is broken! Lower the sail.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.107
We need a metal band to hold it together.

03:53.650 --> 03:54.734
Can you fix it?

03:55.860 --> 03:57.445
Without a forge, no.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.489
There is one in Kodak.

04:00.114 --> 04:01.991
-How far is that?
-Not far.

04:02.075 --> 04:05.245
A day by water, but reachable
over the mountain in a few hours.

04:09.374 --> 04:12.210
Then we camp here. Leif and I will go.

04:17.465 --> 04:20.218
Do they have a market?
Perhaps we can all go.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.929
No. You must watch the boat.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.557
And be alert.
It's dangerous to be on shore.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.000
Allfather.

04:57.213 --> 05:00.633
There must be a reason
why you brought me here.

05:04.053 --> 05:05.638
Send the

05:07.140 --> 05:08.391
Valkyrie Eir to my side.

05:14.355 --> 05:15.648
And fill me

05:18.609 --> 05:19.944
with strength

05:22.238 --> 05:24.532
in this moment of need.

05:40.298 --> 05:42.592
Do you not care
about her and her child?

05:43.176 --> 05:46.137
Freydis has been well taken care of.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.473
She is strong.

05:48.556 --> 05:49.891
But what about the people?

05:51.684 --> 05:56.064
They listen and watch, Harekr!
Since the massacre, they are confused.

05:56.147 --> 05:58.608
I'm not worried about the people.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.319
They know they made a mistake.

06:02.987 --> 06:06.783
And like children, they seek forgiveness.

06:08.826 --> 06:09.744
Unlike…

06:12.163 --> 06:13.456
Jorundr.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.259
I told you.

06:26.594 --> 06:31.474
He was attracted to a girl on the outside
and is still struggling with her loss.

06:32.725 --> 06:33.935
But it is passing.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.190
I hope so.

07:15.226 --> 07:16.394
What am I doing wrong?

07:17.478 --> 07:18.980
Do not aim at the fish.

07:19.605 --> 07:23.067
Aim at where the fish will be
when the arrow strikes the water.

07:37.081 --> 07:38.124
Excellent.

07:38.749 --> 07:41.502
-Now five more.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.338
-We are hungry!

07:56.601 --> 07:58.978
-As lovely as you are…

07:59.645 --> 08:02.482
…I am more interested
in that medallion around your neck.

08:12.700 --> 08:16.454
It is just a necklace
my father gave to me.

08:16.537 --> 08:20.374
I don't think so. I've seen a similar one
before in Constantinople.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.461
We both know
that necklace is very special.

08:25.004 --> 08:25.838
Leave.

08:29.133 --> 08:31.385
Leave! Leave!

09:11.259 --> 09:12.426
Have mercy on me.

09:13.511 --> 09:16.764
Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity,
and cleanse me from my sin.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.438
<i>What did Godwin</i>
<i>tell you about the Bear?</i>

09:25.690 --> 09:27.525
<i>I have never heard that name.</i>

10:21.996 --> 10:23.372
Thank you, Princess Gytha.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.710
She would have appreciated your visit.

10:33.674 --> 10:35.718
I'm sorry for your pain, Earl Godwin.

10:39.221 --> 10:40.640
I hope that it will pass.

10:43.225 --> 10:44.226
I do too.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.571
Seeing you here has helped.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.208
Raiders have been here.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.796
So much for a thriving market.

11:24.433 --> 11:25.726
Look for some metal.

12:01.011 --> 12:02.388
What do you think?

12:10.062 --> 12:11.647
There's enough to work with.

12:16.610 --> 12:19.905
Let's get the fire going
and see what we can do.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.634
Someone's coming!

12:43.846 --> 12:45.181
Is he a Pecheneg?

12:48.142 --> 12:49.435
Looks Varangian.

12:53.647 --> 12:54.857
Something smells good.

13:01.572 --> 13:02.782
I mean you no harm.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.785
Just so long
since I've seen a boat on the river.

13:06.368 --> 13:10.164
I am surprised. Whose is it?

13:10.247 --> 13:11.749
It is mine.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.838
It's a fine boat. Where are you heading?

13:18.464 --> 13:22.259
Constantinople.
If we can get past the Pechenegs.

13:23.594 --> 13:27.223
Your timing is good then.
They are not as bad as before.

13:27.807 --> 13:28.641
How so?

13:29.475 --> 13:31.894
There's been no trade, no one to rob,

13:32.478 --> 13:34.688
so many of the tribes
have moved east to the Volga

13:34.772 --> 13:36.315
where the spoils are better.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.695
You are a slaver.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.616
I am. My name is Gestr. You?

13:45.699 --> 13:46.992
My name is Baggi.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.538
You must be a powerful man, Gestr.

13:50.621 --> 13:53.624
It is one thing
to keep slaves in Novgorod or Kiev

13:53.707 --> 13:55.459
where laws protect your property,

13:55.543 --> 13:59.004
but to do so out here,
where only the powerful rule,

13:59.088 --> 14:00.381
I respect you.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.427
I see your boat is missing its rudder.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.805
It is being repaired in Kodak.

14:07.888 --> 14:09.557
So there are more of you.

14:09.640 --> 14:10.558
Just two.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.064
They are wonderful craftsmen there.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.989
Is this your Pecheneg slave?

14:25.656 --> 14:29.076
-He is our guide.
-A blind Pecheneg, your guide?

14:40.170 --> 14:43.382
You don't know who this is, do you? Huh?

14:44.300 --> 14:47.970
This is the Khan's missing brother, Kurya.

14:49.972 --> 14:53.100
When your guide's brother
became the new Khan,

14:53.183 --> 14:56.687
he stole your man's wife, blinded him

14:56.770 --> 15:00.107
and forced him to listen
while the Khan raped her all night.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.485
The next day while the Khan slept,

15:03.569 --> 15:06.488
Kurya's wife freed him
and helped him escape.

15:06.572 --> 15:10.075
And for her actions,
the Khan butchered her,

15:10.576 --> 15:15.539
and now drinks wine every night
from a silver cup made from her skull.

15:18.208 --> 15:22.713
And put a bounty
on his missing brother's head.

15:23.464 --> 15:24.590
He's worth money?

15:25.841 --> 15:29.511
A great deal of money.

15:30.679 --> 15:32.598
It is time for you to leave.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.102
Yes, of course.

15:37.853 --> 15:39.188
Enjoy your meal!

15:39.980 --> 15:41.273
Safe travels, my friend.

15:56.664 --> 15:57.873
Was what he said true?

16:01.377 --> 16:03.629
Do you have a bounty on your head?

16:05.172 --> 16:07.800
-Yes.
-Then why the hell did you come back?

16:09.301 --> 16:12.012
-To kill my brother.
-We don't have much time.

16:13.013 --> 16:14.098
Time for what?

16:14.181 --> 16:16.100
He will be back with others.

16:16.183 --> 16:19.561
-What makes you think that?
-He had a dozen rabbits on his saddle.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.438
He's feeding more than himself.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.117
What do you see in Mariam?

16:34.576 --> 16:36.245
She has a wealth of knowledge.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.499
And she's taught me to read and write.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.503
Greenland is a hard place.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.382
We have to be more animal than man.

16:53.262 --> 16:57.349
Mariam has shown me a way of being
that is… beyond that.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.727
A world of thought and ideas.

17:02.646 --> 17:05.274
I see something else. You love her.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.070
And if I do?

17:11.572 --> 17:13.157
She's dying, my friend.

17:13.949 --> 17:16.368
I've seen you hurt
once before with Liv's death.

17:19.997 --> 17:22.374
I don't want to see you
hurt again the same way.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.676
Don't worry about me.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.640
I can handle it.

17:43.729 --> 17:46.231
We will need everyone
when the Varangians return.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.525
Gestr.

17:51.278 --> 17:52.488
Unlock the women.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.239
No, they are my property.

18:09.713 --> 18:10.839
Get in your locker.

18:12.299 --> 18:14.551
Get in your locker or I'll cut her throat!

18:14.635 --> 18:19.056
Gestr, the Varangians are thieves.
They will be back to take everything.

18:19.640 --> 18:25.104
No, you are thieves! All of you!
Move. Now everyone off my boat!

19:42.890 --> 19:45.809
-I thought of Freydis today.
-Really?

19:47.269 --> 19:49.396
I'm not sure if I want to hear about this.

19:52.357 --> 19:55.152
When I return
from Constantinople with my riches,

19:55.235 --> 19:59.489
I'm going to buy a boat,
sail to Jomsborg and marry her.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.786
What makes you think
she'll want to marry you?

20:06.288 --> 20:07.289
Ah…

20:08.123 --> 20:10.709
I think my successes
will prove to her my worth.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.003
What?

20:13.086 --> 20:16.798
I know that look.
You know something you're not telling me.

20:21.511 --> 20:22.888
Help me with this.

20:24.473 --> 20:26.350
We have to bend it while it's hot.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.853
Whatever you do,
do not release it, understand?

20:29.937 --> 20:30.771
Yeah.

20:36.109 --> 20:36.944
Harald.

20:38.445 --> 20:39.279
Yes?

20:41.281 --> 20:42.991
Freydis is carrying your child.

20:47.996 --> 20:49.456
How long have you known this?

20:49.539 --> 20:52.918
Since we left Norway.
She made me promise not to tell you.

20:53.001 --> 20:55.420
You bastard. I thought you were my friend!

20:55.504 --> 20:58.340
I am your friend,
which is why I haven't told you.

21:00.008 --> 21:00.968
You can release it.

21:02.719 --> 21:04.721
Leif…

21:06.890 --> 21:07.933
it's my child.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.686
And she is my sister.

21:15.065 --> 21:17.734
She understood
that if you knew you were to be a father,

21:18.402 --> 21:19.444
you would not leave her.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.737
And she's right.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.201
And you,

21:28.495 --> 21:31.248
you waited till I could not
go back there to tell me.

21:32.416 --> 21:35.669
Because you would have.
Future king of Norway.

21:37.170 --> 21:38.797
And that would not have helped you.

21:45.637 --> 21:46.513
Or her.

22:07.576 --> 22:11.455
Hello. Hello. Hello.

22:21.131 --> 22:22.215
My son.

22:25.802 --> 22:27.262
My beautiful boy.

22:34.436 --> 22:38.648
You are a pain,
just like your father.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.403
I will call you Harald.

22:50.494 --> 22:52.037
Aw.

23:15.268 --> 23:17.646
No one knows what the fates intend. Hmm?

23:21.066 --> 23:22.317
One thing we both know…

23:25.278 --> 23:26.780
Freydis will be a good mother.

23:35.330 --> 23:36.498
I got this one.

24:26.965 --> 24:28.258
Do not come near.

24:29.342 --> 24:30.177
No.

25:05.003 --> 25:07.088
No, no, no!

25:20.060 --> 25:20.977
Please.

25:23.563 --> 25:24.481
Don't take him.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.859
Please don't take my son, please.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.028
He's not your son.

25:32.656 --> 25:33.740
He's mine.

25:40.956 --> 25:42.249
Behold!

25:43.708 --> 25:45.961
The son of the chosen one!

25:49.464 --> 25:53.927
Freydis has blessed us
with a boy.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.515
The first son of Jomsborg.

26:02.185 --> 26:04.354
We have truly been blessed by the gods.

26:04.437 --> 26:07.232
He is strong like Thor and Vidar,

26:08.900 --> 26:12.445
but I urge you all
to pray for our Freydis.

26:14.739 --> 26:16.366
The birth was very difficult.

26:17.367 --> 26:18.952
It pains me to tell you

26:20.203 --> 26:21.871
she is gravely ill.

26:22.789 --> 26:26.418
-No!
-Pray she will recover.

26:26.501 --> 26:28.587
Yes!

26:28.670 --> 26:30.964
But if it is the will of the gods…

26:32.966 --> 26:34.092
that she does not,

26:35.010 --> 26:37.470
know that she has left us her gift.

26:39.806 --> 26:42.100
The chosen son of Jomsborg!

26:55.363 --> 26:56.781
-Jorundr!

27:00.410 --> 27:01.369
Jorundr.

27:03.163 --> 27:06.791
It sounds as if he's made
his decision about the future.

27:06.875 --> 27:09.878
-No. He wants you back.

27:09.961 --> 27:12.172
-But he feels betrayed.
-Betrayed?

27:12.964 --> 27:13.882
He betrayed us!

27:13.965 --> 27:15.383
You broke the rules!

27:15.967 --> 27:18.553
-Just tell him you made a mistake.
-Hmm.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.806
It is all he wants to hear
and everything will be like it was.

27:24.225 --> 27:25.060
Please.

28:02.138 --> 28:05.183
Welcome back! I see you brought friends.

28:11.856 --> 28:13.400
What is this?

28:13.483 --> 28:15.402
After you left, he went crazy.

28:15.485 --> 28:17.946
He killed Gestr and threatened us all.

28:18.029 --> 28:21.324
We want to collect the bounty on him,
but we cannot get close enough.

28:22.033 --> 28:24.703
We can help you with that.

28:24.786 --> 28:26.538
Come. Have a drink.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.801
What is wrong with him?

28:40.468 --> 28:44.597
He ate bad mushrooms.
He will be lucky if he survives the night.

28:44.681 --> 28:48.476
Come. Come have a drink with us
while your friends have some fun.

28:51.396 --> 28:54.983
My husband makes the most beautiful wine.

29:00.989 --> 29:02.490
It is excellent.

29:08.121 --> 29:09.622
Who wants some wine?

29:11.124 --> 29:13.793
-See? I told you.
-Mmm.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.754
It is an old family recipe.

29:15.837 --> 29:19.340
-It is good!
-Nectar of the gods.

29:21.760 --> 29:25.513
So, is it true
what they say about Varangians?

29:25.597 --> 29:28.391
That they are the only men Pechenegs fear.

29:28.475 --> 29:31.770
-Who says that?
-Everyone in Novgorod.

29:31.853 --> 29:33.897
The stories they tell are legendary.

29:35.648 --> 29:36.608
Tell me one.

29:47.702 --> 29:49.788
I've come to ask for your forgiveness.

29:52.957 --> 29:55.710
You know my intentions
for these people, Jorundr.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.045
How they must be used.

29:57.128 --> 29:58.421
I was confused.

29:59.297 --> 30:01.674
And I am ashamed.

30:02.926 --> 30:04.177
Your mother says, uh,

30:04.928 --> 30:07.639
a pretty refugee
was the cause of the confusion.

30:07.722 --> 30:13.394
She made me believe that, somehow,
we could all live together as equals.

30:15.772 --> 30:18.566
-This woman was killed in the attack?
-Yes.

30:19.943 --> 30:22.237
But I see now…

30:24.864 --> 30:26.032
it was meant to be.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.201
Hmm.

30:30.203 --> 30:33.039
Then I accept your admission of guilt.

30:35.250 --> 30:36.084
But…

30:39.379 --> 30:41.339
I need to know I can trust you again.

30:45.218 --> 30:46.594
I need you to kill Freydis.

30:48.805 --> 30:52.433
Kill her? Why?

30:52.517 --> 30:55.061
Well, I have her child.
She's of no use any longer.

30:55.144 --> 30:56.479
Huh.

30:56.563 --> 30:57.397
But…

30:59.023 --> 31:00.483
what would the people think?

31:01.109 --> 31:04.362
They will think that she died
of natural causes after the birth.

31:05.238 --> 31:07.907
And any power
she has over them will die with her.

31:09.576 --> 31:10.743
Can you do this?

31:14.205 --> 31:15.456
-Yes.
-Ha!

31:37.687 --> 31:39.188
For Freydis.

31:39.272 --> 31:40.607
Odin is watching over her.

31:40.690 --> 31:43.484
Jorundr, tell Freydis
we are praying for her.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.528
Hope she recovers…

31:46.070 --> 31:47.238
Make an offering.

31:48.448 --> 31:50.116
Pray for her.

32:03.338 --> 32:06.466
Freydis. It's me, Jorundr.

32:17.226 --> 32:18.269
Freydis?

32:26.319 --> 32:27.320
Freydis?

32:34.327 --> 32:38.081
-Freydis! Freydis! Freydis!

32:39.040 --> 32:41.000
Freydis, it's me! Freydis!

32:41.084 --> 32:43.920
-I'm here to help!
-Where's my son? Where's my son?

32:44.003 --> 32:45.421
He's being well looked after.

32:45.505 --> 32:47.256
-You must bring him to me.
-I can't.

32:47.340 --> 32:50.677
-Then get out.
-Listen to me! Harekr intends to kill you.

32:50.760 --> 32:53.680
-I must get you out of here tonight.
-What about my baby?

32:53.763 --> 32:56.224
He's safe. I promise you.
No harm will come to him.

32:56.307 --> 32:58.017
I am not leaving without my son.

32:59.227 --> 33:02.021
I have a boat ready on the gulf
beyond the temple of the forest,

33:02.105 --> 33:03.731
I will slip you out tonight,

33:03.815 --> 33:06.234
but trying to bring your son
is asking too much!

33:06.317 --> 33:10.029
I am not leaving without him.

33:15.535 --> 33:17.370
I'll find a way to get your son.

33:19.747 --> 33:20.957
Don't touch the food.

33:22.375 --> 33:23.376
It is poisoned.

33:26.462 --> 33:28.297
Here. Have more!

33:40.810 --> 33:42.395
You're having a feast without us?

33:43.646 --> 33:46.566
Welcome, brother! Come!

33:51.446 --> 33:53.239
-Welcome!
-My brothers!

33:53.322 --> 33:55.283
Drinks and women!

33:55.366 --> 33:56.617
Smell you from a mile.

34:00.997 --> 34:02.165
I see you, brothers.

34:06.878 --> 34:09.130
-I like your hair.

34:14.635 --> 34:16.971
-What is that noise?

34:17.055 --> 34:18.097
Who's in there?

34:20.933 --> 34:22.477
It's a trick!

34:22.560 --> 34:24.562
Take the women and kill the men!

34:30.943 --> 34:32.153
Kill the men!

34:42.747 --> 34:45.124
-Let her go.
-Put your weapons down!

34:45.208 --> 34:47.210
Or I will kill her!

34:56.219 --> 34:57.595
Take the Pecheneg!

34:58.846 --> 35:00.598
-Move!

35:02.016 --> 35:02.934
Move!

35:12.527 --> 35:13.903
Put them back on!

35:13.986 --> 35:14.987
Now!

35:20.701 --> 35:21.536
Take them.

35:24.831 --> 35:26.124
Wait!

35:28.126 --> 35:30.044
Leave them and I will give you this.

35:33.923 --> 35:36.884
It is from the emperor in Constantinople.

35:38.386 --> 35:42.682
It grants safe passage
and great treasure for the holder.

35:42.765 --> 35:43.683
Bring it here.

35:46.185 --> 35:47.145
No.

35:48.104 --> 35:51.232
First let them go
or I will throw it in the river.

35:52.733 --> 35:55.528
Do you really think
you can bargain with me? Huh?

35:56.112 --> 35:57.405
Did you forget,

35:57.488 --> 36:00.741
it is the one with the power
who sets the rules?

36:00.825 --> 36:02.410
And that's not you!

36:41.824 --> 36:44.452
Release me! I own you!

36:49.707 --> 36:52.126
How dare you let them do this to me?

36:52.210 --> 36:55.755
This is my boat. They are my property!

36:56.797 --> 36:58.174
Please.

37:07.141 --> 37:08.559
I have my rights.

37:52.353 --> 37:53.938
We must re-attach the rudder.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.238
Where is my son?

39:37.583 --> 39:40.378
I need you to both wrap up in this.

39:48.677 --> 39:50.137
I must carry you out.

39:57.228 --> 40:00.731
There is no need to guard the doors
any longer. The priestess is dead.

40:44.942 --> 40:46.068
-Leave us.
-Yes.

40:49.572 --> 40:51.449
Did I murder an innocent woman, Agnarr?

40:54.118 --> 40:55.953
How could I not suspect her?

40:57.746 --> 41:02.126
Her engagement to Godwin,
it was all… too convenient.

41:03.461 --> 41:07.423
Why would a man so ruthlessly ambitious
want to marry a woman with nothing?

41:09.175 --> 41:10.968
It does not make sense to me.

41:11.051 --> 41:13.762
I pray that God
will release me from my guilt

41:13.846 --> 41:15.890
and guide me
to the answer I'm looking for.

41:15.973 --> 41:20.269
I have stopped praying for answers
and went looking for my own.

41:22.688 --> 41:25.566
I've learned that Earl Godwin
has frequently convened

41:25.649 --> 41:27.067
with a man called Cooper.

41:27.151 --> 41:29.403
He owns an alehouse beyond the walls.

41:29.987 --> 41:32.573
What does this man know of Earl Godwin?

41:32.656 --> 41:36.494
"A, uh, finer man
has never walked this Earth."

41:38.329 --> 41:41.040
I trust that you encouraged him
to be a bit more honest.

41:41.123 --> 41:45.503
Godwin was seen paying a man
a large amount of coin

41:46.170 --> 41:48.047
a few days before
the attempt on your life.

41:48.797 --> 41:49.798
The assassin?

41:51.050 --> 41:51.884
No.

41:53.302 --> 41:54.929
A man by the name John Barr.

41:57.515 --> 42:01.769
-The Bear.
-He's from Sussex. Where Godwin grew up.

42:03.062 --> 42:04.355
I'm going to find him.

42:05.689 --> 42:06.815
No.

42:09.151 --> 42:10.486
We are going to find him.

42:41.934 --> 42:43.227
Why have we stopped?

42:43.310 --> 42:45.104
I heard something.

42:47.565 --> 42:48.482
Stay quiet.

43:14.008 --> 43:15.968
What are you doing, Jorundr?

43:22.433 --> 43:26.478
-I'm removing her body.
-Why? I didn't ask you to do that.

43:27.855 --> 43:31.483
The people won't believe the gods
would let Freydis die in her own temple.

43:32.067 --> 43:35.112
They will suspect something,
so I intend to bury it.

43:49.918 --> 43:52.046
Did you really think I would believe that?

43:52.671 --> 43:55.090
You betrayed me once,
why would I trust you now?

43:55.674 --> 44:00.846
If you felt that way, then why did you
let me leave with her? Huh?

44:00.929 --> 44:04.308
So I can now get rid of both of you!

44:07.269 --> 44:09.647
No. You cannot kill her!

44:15.361 --> 44:18.113
He is a traitor.

44:18.781 --> 44:19.615
Hold him.

44:21.909 --> 44:22.743
Come on!

44:26.330 --> 44:27.164
Come on!

44:47.393 --> 44:48.227
She's gone.

44:49.728 --> 44:51.063
Search the woods for her.

44:52.773 --> 44:53.607
Now!

44:55.234 --> 44:56.527
You, you, this way.

44:59.822 --> 45:00.656
This way!

45:02.116 --> 45:03.283
Search the river!
