02:05.493 --> 02:08.621
- Hey, Pete, are you sure
this is the place?

02:08.696 --> 02:11.996
You saw the letter.
This is the place.

02:12.067 --> 02:16.266
Don't you think it's a little
funny, I mean, your uncle
giving you this race car?

02:16.339 --> 02:18.500
- Sentimental reasons.
- Yeah.

02:18.574 --> 02:21.270
Would a cracked block
be a sentimental reason?

02:21.344 --> 02:24.080
All we got to lay out is the storage fee.
You got the money.

02:24.093 --> 02:25.008
I got the money.

02:27.017 --> 02:29.612
All finished!

02:29.688 --> 02:32.248
- Shine?
- No, thanks.

02:32.324 --> 02:36.659
You are personally connected
to a Puerto Vallartan.
Show you plenty good time!

02:36.729 --> 02:39.892
- What do you think, Pete?
- It's not in the budget.
No, thanks, son.

02:39.966 --> 02:43.232
Where do you want to go?
Paco'll show you. Free on the house!

02:47.607 --> 02:50.736
- "Taller mecanico avenida. '"
- Cardenas.!

02:50.812 --> 02:54.304
No problem.
I show you exactly.

02:54.382 --> 02:58.149
I like Americans.
Americans very smart people.

02:58.220 --> 02:59.680
Someday, I go to America.

02:59.693 --> 03:02.418
When you do, you look
up Pete Staniczek here.

03:02.491 --> 03:05.964
He'll put you up, show you
the best ice cream parlors.

03:05.977 --> 03:07.259
That sounds good!

03:07.330 --> 03:09.663
You see down there?
That's Avenue CÃ¡rdenas.

03:09.734 --> 03:12.999
Turn left, that way.
Go two blocks, you'll find Mecanico.

03:13.070 --> 03:14.025
Thanks.

03:14.038 --> 03:16.939
De nada. Anytime! Welcome
to Puerto Vallarta.

03:17.009 --> 03:20.467
- Gracias.
- See you later, alligator.

03:24.550 --> 03:26.814
Cute kid, d'ya know
what I mean?

03:26.886 --> 03:30.084
- Well mannered, polite,
didn't have his hand out.

03:30.157 --> 03:32.921
An endangered species.

03:48.377 --> 03:52.678
- That light area, right around 400.
- I can see it.

03:55.786 --> 04:00.622
- And you say this is Inca.
- You're the expert, you tell me.

04:00.691 --> 04:03.320
Did anyone else spot this?

04:03.395 --> 04:05.955
They were looking for oil.

04:06.031 --> 04:08.090
And where is this?

04:12.572 --> 04:16.632
In the jungles.
South America.

04:16.709 --> 04:21.476
Mr. Shepard, there's nothing
to be gained by our playing games.

04:21.548 --> 04:24.644
This could very well be
an undiscovered Inca city.

04:24.719 --> 04:29.713
And you know what that means:
Pre-Columbian artifacts.

04:29.791 --> 04:34.388
- And gold, Mr. Prindle.
- And what do you want?

04:34.464 --> 04:37.832
Cash.
And plenty of it.

04:37.901 --> 04:41.359
'Cause they're gonna throw
the key away if they find us
stealing that stuff.

04:41.438 --> 04:45.068
Yeah, it's a national
treasure, or something.

04:45.143 --> 04:50.012
- Is there another print of this?
- That's it.

04:50.081 --> 04:54.610
Gentlemen,
we're in business.

04:54.687 --> 04:57.452
There's gotta
be some mistake.

04:57.524 --> 04:59.856
Ah, no, senores.
No, senores.

04:59.926 --> 05:03.760
This is not a mistake.
This is senor Douglas' car.

05:03.831 --> 05:08.291
And you're telling me that this thing
won the Monte Carlo Grand Prix?

05:08.369 --> 05:11.134
That is what senor Douglas
told me.

05:11.206 --> 05:13.640
He say he'd have won
the Baja race too...

05:13.709 --> 05:18.170
but his girlfriend...
did not make the curve.

05:18.248 --> 05:23.948
Herbie, he see it, he stop.
He no finish the race.

05:24.021 --> 05:27.513
Senor Douglas say,
"it's here."

05:30.862 --> 05:33.023
Let's turn it over.

05:33.098 --> 05:35.362
La llave, senor.

05:42.308 --> 05:47.906
- Okay, so it runs.
- Let's take it.
It's transportation home.

05:56.424 --> 05:59.019
- Senor.
- Si, senor?

05:59.094 --> 06:03.360
Mind if we take it
around the block first?

06:03.432 --> 06:05.867
Okay, senor.

06:24.156 --> 06:27.854
Cute kid, huh?
Doesn't have his hand out.

06:27.927 --> 06:30.725
He doesn't have his hand out
because it's in your pocket.

06:30.797 --> 06:33.426
You check that side.

06:34.735 --> 06:37.795
See if you can
find us a taxi.

06:41.042 --> 06:45.104
- I'll get you a taxi, senor!
- Get lost, kid. Taxi!

06:45.181 --> 06:49.345
All right, 1200,
the National Hotel Bar.

06:49.418 --> 06:52.115
I'll be there.

06:52.189 --> 06:54.282
- Carry your bags, senor?
- Move along, sonny.

06:54.358 --> 06:56.792
- No trouble. I carry your bags cheap!
- Put the bags down.

06:56.860 --> 07:00.820
- I said, put the bags down!
- Hey, kid!

07:00.898 --> 07:04.197
- Come on, get away from me, will ya?
- Taxi.!

07:05.671 --> 07:09.334
Very sorry, senores.
Please, you forgive me!

07:31.466 --> 07:34.664
He said he liked Americans
and put his arms around us.

07:34.737 --> 07:37.228
Then took us to the cleaners.
Never mind reenacting the crime.

07:37.307 --> 07:40.334
Just look for the little...
There!

07:44.615 --> 07:47.847
See that grubby little foot
out behind that box?

07:47.919 --> 07:50.834
A cold beer says it's
attached to Paco the dip.

07:50.847 --> 07:51.821
Shh. Shh.

08:03.403 --> 08:06.703
Come back here,
you little bandit!

08:06.774 --> 08:11.211
- We need that worse than you do.!
- Don't scare him.! Talk to him nicely.!

08:21.658 --> 08:24.218
Ooh!

08:24.294 --> 08:26.286
Yee! Ah!

08:28.966 --> 08:33.597
Buenos dias.!

08:33.672 --> 08:37.403
Oh!

08:39.245 --> 08:42.304
I'm sorry, lady.
We're looking for a little kid.

08:42.381 --> 08:45.681
Did you see a little kid?
I'm sorry.

08:45.752 --> 08:48.187
Me too, lady.

08:56.231 --> 08:58.665
You look that way.

09:09.079 --> 09:13.483
- What took you so long?
- It's not easy in this town.

09:13.551 --> 09:19.114
Mr. Prindle, if you want
to get in touch with me before,
you can use this number.

09:20.726 --> 09:23.718
- My wallet's gone.
- Maybe you left it up in the room.

09:25.697 --> 09:29.156
It was that kid.
That crummy little kid!

09:41.550 --> 09:43.916
Buenos dias.!

10:03.141 --> 10:05.609
I don't know.
He must've skipped town.

10:05.677 --> 10:08.442
No, he didn't.
This time we sack him.

10:08.514 --> 10:11.108
You take him low,
I'll take him high.

10:32.007 --> 10:35.444
- Oh, no, you don't!
- Is that yours?

10:35.512 --> 10:38.106
- No!
- Is it ours?

10:38.181 --> 10:41.208
- Si.!
- Grab loose of that.

10:43.320 --> 10:46.881
- Nah, looks like that's all he got.
- I'll take over, dipstick.

10:46.958 --> 10:49.222
I oughta tan your bottom!

10:57.136 --> 10:59.570
Oh, I got another one

11:02.376 --> 11:04.708
Look, there he is!

11:04.778 --> 11:08.215
Hold it, kid!

11:08.283 --> 11:11.013
- Wait a minute!
- Hold it, kid!

11:11.085 --> 11:14.317
- Wait!
- Why? What we want's in that mailbox.

11:14.390 --> 11:18.053
Let's get the kid first,
just in case. Come on!

11:24.868 --> 11:27.200
Somebody, stop that boy!

11:30.808 --> 11:35.007
Stop that kid, someone.!
Hey, you, grab him.! Anybody.!

11:41.721 --> 11:44.019
He's over here,
come on!

12:06.816 --> 12:10.184
Look up there!
Over here too!

12:47.696 --> 12:50.996
- Busca alla arriba.
- Si.

14:09.324 --> 14:12.350
Well, like you said,
transportation.

14:12.427 --> 14:15.260
Let's close the deal
and get out of here.

14:21.637 --> 14:23.572
There he is!
In the car!

14:43.696 --> 14:47.393
What, are you planning to sleep
over at the local jail, lead foot?

14:47.467 --> 14:50.460
I'm not doin' anything!

14:50.538 --> 14:55.475
- Maybe this bug did win the Grand Prix!
- We got ourselves a race car.

14:57.012 --> 15:00.243
- This your wallet?
- Yes, Officer, thank you very much.

15:03.619 --> 15:06.645
- Is something missing, senor?
- No, everything's fine.

15:06.722 --> 15:08.690
It's all here.

15:08.758 --> 15:11.489
We will continue looking
for the car and the boy, of course.

15:11.562 --> 15:15.328
Thank you, Officer.
We'll catch up with you.

15:18.036 --> 15:19.970
Film's gone.

15:20.038 --> 15:21.033
Why would a kid take it?

15:21.046 --> 15:22.906
I don't know, we gotta
get it back, though.

15:22.975 --> 15:25.967
I'll never get
another one.

15:30.550 --> 15:35.749
Steady, boys! That's the car that's
going to win the Grand Primeo at Brazil!

15:35.822 --> 15:38.758
- Something's weird about that car, D.J.
- I know!

15:38.826 --> 15:42.660
It's dynamite and it'll blow the doors
off anything in the race.

15:50.840 --> 15:55.140
Attention, please. Sun Princess
will be embarking in 20 minutes.

16:01.518 --> 16:04.283
We blew it.

16:04.356 --> 16:06.950
The car's on the ship;
the boy's on the ship.

16:07.025 --> 16:09.823
- That thing's going to Rio.
- Its first stop is Panama.

16:09.896 --> 16:13.457
When it gets there,
we'll be waiting for it.

16:18.939 --> 16:24.105
The booty was taken aboard
the man-o'-war and
the enemy vessel scuttled.

16:24.178 --> 16:27.204
The women were then
turned over to the crew...

16:27.282 --> 16:31.242
the select ones going
to the officers, naturally.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.758
The wenches were escorted
below and, believe

16:33.771 --> 16:36.383
me, there was no poetry
or "by your leave'"...

16:36.458 --> 16:41.897
or "how lovely you look, madam. '"
One got to the matter at hand
in short order.

16:41.965 --> 16:46.096
Each captive seaman
was given 100 lashes with the cat...

16:46.170 --> 16:49.571
- spread-eagled on the rigging.
- My dear Captain Blythe.

16:52.210 --> 16:56.271
They didn't last long
in those latitudes, I can tell you.

16:56.348 --> 17:00.752
In no time at all, they were bloated
carrion for the birds of prey.

17:00.820 --> 17:03.984
Yah!

17:04.058 --> 17:07.221
Oh, do have some
of the green turtle soup, Mrs. Purkiss.

17:07.294 --> 17:09.694
It's the chef's specialty.

17:14.502 --> 17:18.598
Well, they'd no sooner
broken out the grog...

17:18.674 --> 17:20.689
then the entire Spanish
armada was closing on them.

17:20.702 --> 17:21.939
Everything looks so tempting.

17:22.011 --> 17:24.445
Yes.
Doesn't it?

17:24.513 --> 17:28.712
They were met with stiff resistance
as they clambered aboard.

17:28.785 --> 17:32.620
- It was parry and thrust,
thrust and parry.

17:38.864 --> 17:41.662
- Uh, permit me.
- Thank you.

17:43.969 --> 17:46.837
- Anyone else?
- Oh. No, thanks.

17:48.942 --> 17:53.039
Where was I?
Well, the deck was awash with blood!

17:53.114 --> 17:55.742
What are you gonna have?

17:55.816 --> 17:59.253
I think I'll have
that captain...

17:59.321 --> 18:01.881
on a bed of roses.

18:01.957 --> 18:05.291
Blast of grape
might sweep the deck clean.

18:05.361 --> 18:09.821
- Aunt Louise, you're incorrigible.
- I know!

18:09.899 --> 18:14.860
I've never regretted
a moment of it.

18:17.842 --> 18:19.742
Right this way,
gentlemen.

18:24.750 --> 18:27.685
My goodness,
what a pleasant surprise.

18:27.753 --> 18:31.747
Two handsome young gentlemen as our
dining companions. I'm Louise Trends.

18:31.825 --> 18:34.259
- DavyJohns.
- Pete Staniczek.

18:34.327 --> 18:37.194
Pete, this is
my niece Melissa.

18:37.264 --> 18:40.166
Well, sit down,
sit down.

18:40.234 --> 18:43.533
Oh, just lucky,
I guess.

18:43.604 --> 18:46.438
- You gentlemen going to Rio?
- Not exactly, ma'am.

18:46.508 --> 18:49.033
Oh, I was telling Melissa...

18:49.111 --> 18:51.444
Rio is a city
of romance.

18:51.514 --> 18:56.747
You really, to get the most out of it,
have to share it with someone.

18:56.820 --> 19:00.882
- Wasn't I, Melissa?
- Aunt Louise.

19:00.958 --> 19:04.394
Well, personally, I won't have much time
for that sort of thing.

19:04.462 --> 19:09.127
I'll be utilizing every moment
I have copying down material
for my doctorate.

19:09.201 --> 19:11.192
You're gonna be a doctor?

19:11.269 --> 19:15.434
Yes, of Latin American
cultures.

19:15.508 --> 19:18.444
Celery?
Cool it with the doctor bit.

19:19.746 --> 19:22.442
Well, so what does take
you gentlemen to Rio?

19:22.516 --> 19:27.318
Actually, we're headed further
south. We're entering a car
in the Brazil Grand Primeo.

19:27.388 --> 19:31.188
Pete here handles the wheel.
The rest is my lookout.

19:31.259 --> 19:34.457
- You're a race driver.
- Yeah.

19:34.530 --> 19:37.328
Oh, isn't that fascinating!

19:37.399 --> 19:41.666
- Oh, I love race cars,
don't you, Melissa?
- Not really.

19:47.678 --> 19:50.670
Well... hungry?

19:57.089 --> 20:00.787
Ah!
Ahh.

20:00.860 --> 20:04.159
Ah! Here we go.

20:19.949 --> 20:22.281
Buon appetito, eh?

20:26.290 --> 20:29.987
Ah!

20:45.044 --> 20:49.072
But I checked the pressure
five minutes ago. Everything is fine.!

20:49.149 --> 20:54.315
Number one, okay.!
Yes, I know how Capt. Blythe is...

20:54.388 --> 20:59.155
but I tell you, the dial is right
on the nose. I see it for myself.

21:25.824 --> 21:29.283
Who take-a my chicken?

21:46.315 --> 21:51.082
Aha! So you think you can steal
Armando's dinner and get away with it?

21:51.153 --> 21:53.384
We're gonna see about that.
Oh, yes.

21:53.456 --> 21:57.415
Okay. Open up.
Open up, little car.

21:57.494 --> 22:00.487
No car's gonna eat my dinner.
Open up. I tell you!

22:00.564 --> 22:04.261
Open up!

22:14.981 --> 22:18.576
Aha! Heh-heh-heh!
Open up.

22:18.651 --> 22:21.587
Open up.

22:26.761 --> 22:29.423
You can't drive
that car down here.

22:38.341 --> 22:42.335
This is the number one hold.
Some of your cargo, it's-a broke loose!

22:42.412 --> 22:47.646
Send your officer watch down here fast,
no, but I mean real fast! Si.

22:54.560 --> 22:57.996
- Hey, what's going on?
- That car has no driver!

22:58.063 --> 23:01.124
Better notify
Captain Blythe!

23:12.480 --> 23:16.144
Shh.! All right, men.
Spread out and be careful.

23:21.491 --> 23:23.925
Psst!

23:37.175 --> 23:39.609
Now.!

23:45.351 --> 23:49.220
And I am to believe
that this... car...

23:49.289 --> 23:52.452
ate your chicken dinner?

23:52.526 --> 23:56.588
Eh, and then he spit out the bones!

23:56.664 --> 24:01.693
- Who is this?
- Wiper, third class,
Armando Moccia, sir.

24:01.770 --> 24:05.570
Do you know the penalty
for drinking on duty...

24:05.641 --> 24:07.667
wiper, third class?

24:07.744 --> 24:11.236
Armando not touch one drop. No, please!

24:11.314 --> 24:14.751
The car ate my apple.
I know because I hear with my own ears!

24:14.819 --> 24:17.310
Eh! Muncha-muncha-munch!

24:17.388 --> 24:20.186
Muncha-muncha-munch, eh?

24:20.257 --> 24:25.195
- Do you know what I'm going
to do with your ears?

24:27.032 --> 24:31.663
- Uh, where is the car now?
- Went for a drive after dinner.

24:31.737 --> 24:36.539
Oh. And was it smoking a cigar
and drinking a brandy?

24:38.412 --> 24:42.315
The perpetrator of this little jest
will receive 50 lashes...

24:42.383 --> 24:45.978
- before ship's company
and set adrift in a...

24:50.326 --> 24:56.288
Perhaps you'll be good enough
to tell me about your grandson
Snooky another time.

25:04.575 --> 25:08.910
Wiper, third class, Armando Moccia?

25:08.981 --> 25:11.541
Aye-aye, sir.

25:28.837 --> 25:32.068
Ah!

25:34.009 --> 25:36.911
Okay, men, secure it.
Get the blocks and make it good.

25:36.979 --> 25:42.213
Capitane.
Muncha-muncha-muncha! Si.!

25:43.453 --> 25:45.444
See? Hah!

26:04.477 --> 26:06.468
Now.

26:06.546 --> 26:10.142
- How did you want to handle that?
- You mean pay for it?

26:10.217 --> 26:15.815
Or did you plan to, uh,
reassemble the stemware yourself?

26:15.891 --> 26:19.327
It's not our responsibility.

26:19.394 --> 26:23.832
I'm your captain, judge and jury.
I'll decide what's your responsibility!

26:23.900 --> 26:26.460
Captain!

26:31.008 --> 26:35.571
The, uh, the cargo manifest
states unequivocally...

26:35.647 --> 26:39.947
that you, Peter Staniczek,
are the sole owner of the car.

26:40.018 --> 26:44.319
You are the consignor
and the consignee.

26:44.390 --> 26:46.790
Your car did damage, ergo...

26:46.859 --> 26:49.454
- Yeah, but Pete wasn't driving...
- Stow it!

26:51.698 --> 26:55.829
I, uh, I have been advised
by our public relations department...

26:55.903 --> 26:59.703
to waive all charges
of kidnapping...

26:59.774 --> 27:03.609
and smuggling illegal aliens
into a foreign country.

27:03.679 --> 27:06.273
- Where is that kid, anyway?
- In the storeroom...

27:06.348 --> 27:08.976
where he'll remain until
the ship reaches Panama...

27:09.051 --> 27:11.612
at which time he will be turned
over to the port authorities...

27:11.688 --> 27:14.987
and returned
to his native country.

27:15.058 --> 27:18.392
In the meantime,
your automobile will be impounded...

27:18.462 --> 27:21.454
until your obligations
are met.

27:23.802 --> 27:26.464
Captain.

27:28.440 --> 27:31.342
Uh, gentlemen...

27:31.411 --> 27:34.539
I do hope you've been
enjoying the cruise so far.

27:34.614 --> 27:38.244
Remember, we have
a shuffleboard tournament
on main deck at four bells...

27:38.318 --> 27:41.754
and, uh, disco lessons
in the lounge at six bells.

27:45.460 --> 27:47.894
Thanks, anyway.

27:51.133 --> 27:55.661
We can write the captain an
I.O.U. And pay him out of our
winning at the Grand Primeo.

27:55.738 --> 27:58.173
There's no way we can raise
that kind of money.

27:58.241 --> 28:01.267
Maybe we should chalk it up
to experience and work our way home.

28:01.344 --> 28:05.247
- Maybe Aunt Louise will bail us.
- You are a dreamer, D.J.

28:05.316 --> 28:10.914
Wait a minute.
She likes cars and she's trying
to get her niece hooked up.

28:10.989 --> 28:14.789
Yeah?

28:14.860 --> 28:17.455
- No!
- Wait a minute.

28:17.530 --> 28:21.432
All you gotta do is keep the doc
enthralled with tales of derring-do...

28:21.501 --> 28:25.233
while I initiate Aunt Louise
into the delights of Formula One racing.

28:25.306 --> 28:30.142
- I don't like it.
- Come on, man! Nothing good comes easy.

28:30.212 --> 28:33.978
Lots of charm,
lots of charm.

28:44.027 --> 28:48.464
You may not believe this,
this is an exact replica,
down to the last button...

28:48.532 --> 28:52.765
of the uniform worn by Lord Nelson
when he defeated the Spanish armada.

28:52.837 --> 28:56.204
- Seems like it belongs
on me, doesn't it?
- I love a uniform.

28:56.274 --> 29:00.575
It gives a man a certain...

29:00.646 --> 29:04.174
- At ease, madam!
- Captain!

29:04.251 --> 29:08.119
Excuse me, I must circulate
among the cargo... uh, passengers.

29:10.491 --> 29:14.188
Anyway, like I was saying,
it's the thrill of a lifetime...

29:14.262 --> 29:18.996
when you see that car that
belongs to you streak across
that finish line a winner.

29:19.067 --> 29:24.870
Not only that, you're part
of the technological advancement
of the automotive world.

29:24.941 --> 29:27.671
- Oh, really.
- Mm-hmm.

29:27.744 --> 29:30.976
I wonder...
where the kids are.

29:31.048 --> 29:33.312
Now isn't that...

29:33.384 --> 29:37.047
In my heart and my hand

29:37.121 --> 29:39.886
I've never seen

29:39.958 --> 29:45.090
- They seem to be enjoying themselves.
- Yeah, they're hitting it off.

29:45.164 --> 29:50.033
Pete's a great guy.
He's what I call a beautiful person.

29:50.102 --> 29:53.766
With your head up in a cloud

29:53.841 --> 29:56.139
Where you belong

29:56.210 --> 30:01.581
Please look at me

30:03.117 --> 30:06.576
lf I stay around

30:06.655 --> 30:10.819
Maybe something good
will happen

30:10.894 --> 30:14.295
Like you'll
look into my eyes

30:14.364 --> 30:16.730
And realize

30:16.800 --> 30:19.565
My kind of racin'.

30:19.637 --> 30:22.606
Oh, pardon me.
That's the third time I've done that.

30:22.673 --> 30:25.871
Who's counting?
I'm having a great time.

30:25.944 --> 30:30.608
- Are you really?
- Yeah.

30:32.318 --> 30:34.309
And so

30:34.387 --> 30:38.950
Usually when we race,
a good time means towing
the crew across Texas...

30:39.026 --> 30:42.621
in the middle of August,
looking for a Denny's...

30:42.696 --> 30:46.292
then bedding down
in some fleabag motel.

30:46.368 --> 30:49.929
Now here I am...

30:50.005 --> 30:54.272
soft lights, sweet music...

30:54.343 --> 30:56.402
pretty girl.

30:56.479 --> 31:00.246
Uh, Mr. Staniczek, you don't
really have to say those things.

31:00.317 --> 31:04.549
Oh, I know that. It's just that you're
different than other girls I've known.

31:07.225 --> 31:11.127
- I can well imagine.
- No, no, it's a compliment.

31:11.195 --> 31:15.292
For one thing, you don't giggle
when there's nothing funny.

31:15.367 --> 31:19.464
And you listen when I talk.
A man looks a long way
for a girl like that.

31:19.539 --> 31:22.440
And, uh...

31:28.349 --> 31:32.150
And maybe then

31:32.220 --> 31:35.656
- Our fingers touch
- You are pretty, Melissa.

31:35.724 --> 31:40.219
And you'll thrill me
oh, so much

31:40.296 --> 31:43.788
A lovely dream

31:43.866 --> 31:47.735
That's meant to be

31:47.805 --> 31:53.210
lf you would give

31:53.278 --> 31:55.644
One look

31:55.714 --> 32:00.448
At me

32:02.421 --> 32:04.855
Ah, this is it.

32:10.430 --> 32:13.423
I just want to thank you
for this evening.

32:13.501 --> 32:18.063
- L-I really enjoyed myself.
- Me too.

32:21.143 --> 32:24.044
Well, good night.

32:24.113 --> 32:26.548
Melissa?

32:50.410 --> 32:53.471
- This is the pits.
- Did something go wrong?

32:53.547 --> 32:56.038
We went wrong
when we got into this.

32:56.116 --> 32:59.109
I don't like playing games
with people.

32:59.187 --> 33:02.122
Come on, just a couple more days.
I already got the money.

33:02.190 --> 33:05.455
Aunt Louise gave me a check.
We got the car out of hock.

33:05.527 --> 33:08.622
And get this, kiddo.
She's gonna sponsor us all the way.

33:08.697 --> 33:13.567
We name it, she buys it.!
All you gotta do is keep making
like Burt Reynolds.

33:13.637 --> 33:17.164
- So, that's the deal.
- Well, I sorta read it
between the lines.

33:17.240 --> 33:20.699
Anyway, the important thing
is we're back in the running.

33:20.778 --> 33:25.147
Ahh! Nothing's gonna
stop us now.

33:57.520 --> 34:01.150
Hi!

34:09.667 --> 34:13.695
- That captain sure was mad, wasn't he?
- Honk!

34:13.772 --> 34:16.467
- What is he gonna do with you?
- Honk-honk-honk.

34:16.542 --> 34:22.106
They will send me back where I live...
with the orphans.

34:22.181 --> 34:26.882
But it's okay.
They put me back, I run away again.

34:26.954 --> 34:29.547
- Can we be friends?
- Honk.

34:29.623 --> 34:31.888
- What's your name?
- Honk-honk.

34:31.958 --> 34:35.396
- Que?
- Honk-honk.

34:36.831 --> 34:41.634
- I just call you "Ocho," okay?
- Honk-honk.

35:13.875 --> 35:16.343
Atta boy, Ocho!

35:43.809 --> 35:47.245
Thanks, Ocho.
I'll pay you back.

35:47.313 --> 35:51.249
But you better go back where you were,
so you won't get in trouble.

36:00.327 --> 36:03.388
Oh-oh!

36:10.640 --> 36:14.007
There it goes!
Don't let it get out of this hold, men!

36:31.463 --> 36:33.863
Check over
by the elevator, men.!

36:47.181 --> 36:50.811
In those days,
a captain was a captain.

36:52.354 --> 36:56.086
And a ship was a ship,
not a floating carnival.

36:56.159 --> 36:59.993
And the only women aboard
were dragged there by
the scruff of their neck!

37:00.063 --> 37:03.090
Whoo, gives me goose bumps
just thinking about it.

37:03.167 --> 37:06.159
The captain is having
a little jest with you ladies.

37:06.236 --> 37:09.502
I'm only telling it
like it was.

37:09.574 --> 37:12.008
Or should be.

37:12.077 --> 37:15.343
Yes, when you talked about
liberation in those days...

37:15.414 --> 37:17.848
you were talking
about battles...

37:17.917 --> 37:21.479
nations, empires.

37:28.196 --> 37:30.664
Oh! Oh!

37:30.732 --> 37:34.099
Oh, Captain.
Oh, my word.!

37:34.168 --> 37:36.330
Sorry!

37:43.012 --> 37:47.608
But, Captain, how can a car
release a boy with a key? Explain that!

37:47.684 --> 37:51.314
I can't explain that
any more than I can explain
the Bermuda Triangle, madam.

37:51.389 --> 37:52.609
Nor do I intend to try.

37:52.622 --> 37:55.086
Captain, I am the sponsor
of that little car.

37:55.160 --> 37:58.357
It's going to win
the Brazil Grand Primeo.

37:58.430 --> 38:01.992
If you can bring that off,
I will not only part the Red Sea...

38:02.068 --> 38:04.127
I will tint it magenta.

38:04.203 --> 38:08.162
Oh, oh, Captain.
I appeal to you as a woman...

38:08.241 --> 38:10.972
a desperate, helpless...

38:11.044 --> 38:14.275
single woman.

38:14.348 --> 38:15.754
Spare that car.

38:15.767 --> 38:20.015
Lorelei and her sirens could
not make me veer one degree!

38:20.088 --> 38:24.549
- My course is set!
- Oh!

38:27.830 --> 38:32.268
Ship's company!
Stand to to witness punishment!

38:32.335 --> 38:35.669
Sir, the passengers
might not understand.

38:35.740 --> 38:39.699
I am simply abiding
by the traditions of the sea...

38:39.777 --> 38:42.212
Chief Steward.

38:43.916 --> 38:47.682
By the powers vested in me
as the captain of this ship...

38:47.753 --> 38:50.484
I hereby deem this vehicle
a menace...

38:50.557 --> 38:55.017
to life and limb and the very
safety of the vessel itself.

38:55.094 --> 38:58.258
I herewith commit it
to the sea...

38:58.332 --> 39:01.199
a fate well-deserved.

39:01.268 --> 39:04.466
Doff hats!

39:06.942 --> 39:10.936
Seamen... do your duty.

40:20.192 --> 40:24.687
- You too?
- Oh, bag and baggage.

40:24.765 --> 40:28.064
Anyone remotely associated with
that little car is being put ashore.

40:28.135 --> 40:30.866
If it hadn't been for that steward,
we'd have been keelhauled.

40:30.939 --> 40:35.171
- Sorry it turned out like this.
- If I decided to get out
of needlepoint...

40:35.243 --> 40:38.213
and into racing,
it was my choice.

40:40.115 --> 40:44.553
- Actually, there's more
to it than that.
- Steady, steady.

40:44.621 --> 40:49.684
We needed backing, so D.J.
Pitched you on the car while... l...

40:49.759 --> 40:53.218
Pitched my niece
on the fantail.

40:53.297 --> 40:57.496
I've got too much mileage
on me not to recognize...

40:57.569 --> 40:59.560
an operation
when I see one.

40:59.638 --> 41:02.163
You mean you knew that?

41:04.177 --> 41:08.273
Well, I was hoping that...

41:08.348 --> 41:11.716
something might happen
between you and Melissa.

41:11.785 --> 41:15.846
She's really
a wonderful girl.

41:15.923 --> 41:17.280
She's terrific but...

41:17.293 --> 41:20.088
A little klutzy for
someone like yourself.

41:20.161 --> 41:22.823
Not everybody's
made for each other.

41:22.897 --> 41:26.095
I really like her and I
don't want her to get hurt.

41:26.168 --> 41:29.433
I plan to tell her but maybe
you can smooth things over.

41:29.505 --> 41:32.168
- Here's your bag, miss.
- Thank you.

41:32.242 --> 41:35.507
Melissa, there you are!
I was just looking...

41:35.579 --> 41:39.949
- You meet such
interesting types on ships.
- Melissa!

41:41.686 --> 41:44.121
Sorry, boys.

41:47.526 --> 41:49.721
Come on, pal.

41:53.233 --> 41:56.930
How do you say
in Panamanian...

41:57.003 --> 41:59.734
we need a job?

41:59.807 --> 42:03.971
Excuse me. I don't know
where you're taking this boy,
but I have prior claim on him.

42:04.046 --> 42:07.140
- Are you from Juvenile Authority?
- Yes, I am.

42:07.215 --> 42:09.775
- No, he's not!
- Aah!
- Aah!

42:09.851 --> 42:11.649
We'll handle this!

42:14.023 --> 42:18.859
- Grab that kid!
- Stop that kid!
He's wanted by the police!

42:28.573 --> 42:32.135
We gotta get that kid!

42:32.211 --> 42:34.406
We'll get him.

42:51.166 --> 42:55.125
Tom, you better come
take a look at this.

43:04.247 --> 43:05.957
What the devil is that?

43:05.970 --> 43:09.481
I don't know. Supposed
to be the Major Maroux.

43:38.153 --> 43:40.679
Ocho?

43:52.069 --> 43:57.063
Ocho!

44:04.650 --> 44:08.747
I'm coming, Ocho,
I'm coming!

44:15.863 --> 44:20.358
- Ayudame, andale.!
- Vamonos.!

44:57.210 --> 45:00.874
What is the matter,
muchacho?

45:00.948 --> 45:05.943
- It's an old wreck.
- But he was my good friend.

45:06.021 --> 45:10.185
Your friend is good for nothing
but junk.

45:16.165 --> 45:18.963
Hey, even junk...

45:19.035 --> 45:21.470
worth something.

45:52.908 --> 45:55.342
Bye, Ocho.

45:58.280 --> 46:00.715
Vaya con Dios.

46:16.969 --> 46:20.406
Ocho!

46:22.842 --> 46:25.402
Come on, Ocho,
you can do it. Try, try!

46:32.219 --> 46:35.678
Please, Ocho, come on!

46:37.025 --> 46:41.156
Don't give up now,
please, please.!

46:41.230 --> 46:44.757
Try, try!

46:48.338 --> 46:51.466
I help you!

47:08.360 --> 47:12.729
It's those men.
Come on, you gotta start!

47:14.267 --> 47:18.135
You're whippin'
a dead horse, muchacho.

47:20.441 --> 47:22.432
We gotta get outta here!

47:22.510 --> 47:26.139
This is our car now!
Go play someplace else.

47:29.284 --> 47:32.651
Sal de ahi, muchacho.
Ay.!

47:41.866 --> 47:44.630
You feeling better, Ocho.

48:06.260 --> 48:08.286
A friend

48:09.831 --> 48:13.096
It takes one to be one

48:13.168 --> 48:16.605
Takes some time 'til
the light starts shinin'

48:16.672 --> 48:19.505
On a friendship

48:19.575 --> 48:22.511
A friend

48:22.579 --> 48:26.413
Step up if you need one

48:26.483 --> 48:28.475
Stick out your hand

48:28.553 --> 48:32.751
They should understand
it's a friendship

48:32.824 --> 48:35.919
A buenos dias
Come on, try

48:35.994 --> 48:39.521
A pat on the back
A wink of the eye

48:39.598 --> 48:43.262
That's what friends are for
and remember this, charro

48:43.336 --> 48:47.432
They'll stick with you
today and tomorrow

48:49.543 --> 48:51.773
Amigo

48:53.214 --> 48:56.446
It's nice if you've got one

48:56.518 --> 48:59.112
But it's nicer
if you're not one to stop

48:59.187 --> 49:01.782
From lookin'for more

49:01.858 --> 49:06.056
The world is full of people
who need you so much

49:06.128 --> 49:09.530
A million hearts there
to touch

49:09.600 --> 49:11.625
And I bet you a banana

49:11.702 --> 49:15.799
Manana you'll have
a new friend

49:19.544 --> 49:21.536
And I bet you a banana

49:21.614 --> 49:25.209
Manana you'll have
a new friend

49:29.256 --> 49:31.247
A friend

49:31.324 --> 49:33.815
It's nice when you see one

49:33.894 --> 49:38.161
But it's nicer
when you be one

50:06.831 --> 50:10.131
You look good, Ocho,
like a real taxi.

50:10.202 --> 50:13.069
Now we're gonna make
lots of money.

50:13.139 --> 50:16.701
Then Paco will never have to
take nothin'from nobody again.

50:19.346 --> 50:22.043
Just relax, sonny.

50:27.121 --> 50:29.818
- Now, where is it?
- Where's what?

50:29.892 --> 50:34.124
There was some film in the wallet
you took from us in Puerto Vallarta.

50:34.196 --> 50:36.791
When we got it back,
it was missing.

50:36.866 --> 50:40.666
- Where is it?
- I don't know. Maybe it got mixed-up.

50:40.737 --> 50:44.868
- What do you mean, "mixed-up"?
- With the other man's wallet.

50:44.942 --> 50:46.842
He's lying.

50:46.911 --> 50:50.473
Maybe, maybe not.

50:50.549 --> 50:54.645
Now you listen to me.
I want that film back.

50:54.720 --> 50:58.555
I don't care how you do it,
just get it back!

50:58.624 --> 51:00.649
Because if you don't...

51:05.799 --> 51:10.965
he's gonna cut this car of yours
up into tiny, little pieces.

51:11.039 --> 51:15.339
You understand, kid, huh?
Little strips to hang on
your Christmas tree?

51:15.410 --> 51:18.073
Comprende?

51:18.147 --> 51:20.547
Si.

51:24.054 --> 51:27.319
You know, Pete,
I was just thinking.

51:27.391 --> 51:30.759
Do you realize that that car
could've put us in the big time?

51:30.828 --> 51:34.559
We could've been
international celebrities.

51:34.632 --> 51:36.032
You know what I mean?

51:36.101 --> 51:39.070
Endorsements,
groupies chasin' after us.

51:39.138 --> 51:43.007
It's that kid.
Murphy's Law took over from
the time we ran into that brat.

51:43.076 --> 51:45.772
Hi, guys.

51:45.845 --> 51:49.178
Speaking of
four-foot crime waves.

51:52.620 --> 51:56.056
I come to say, I sorry
if I make trouble for you.

51:56.124 --> 51:58.285
Yeah, well, fine.
See you around.

51:58.360 --> 52:03.424
Paco go. I just want you
not be mad at me.

52:11.675 --> 52:14.735
Now don't start that.
Nobody's mad.

52:14.812 --> 52:17.611
It's water over the dam.

52:21.786 --> 52:25.746
I'm sorry.
Please, you forgive me?

52:32.699 --> 52:35.133
Fine, kid,
no hard feelings.

52:35.202 --> 52:37.899
Forget it.

52:43.010 --> 52:46.105
Straight back there,
through that hallway and to the right.

52:46.181 --> 52:47.808
Gracias.!

52:47.883 --> 52:52.150
Gloriosky! Just makes you
feel good all over.

52:58.195 --> 53:00.186
He did it again.

53:10.443 --> 53:13.173
Come back here,
you little bandit!

53:13.246 --> 53:16.978
Hey, that's our car.!

53:17.050 --> 53:20.679
- How can that be our car?
- I don't know. Let's get him!

53:20.754 --> 53:23.952
We better get outta here,
or those guys are gonna get you back!

53:30.933 --> 53:34.164
Shepard's ready.
He's got the plane.

53:34.236 --> 53:37.570
Good.
Here comes the boy.

53:45.116 --> 53:48.574
Why, that little,
double-crossing... Come on!

53:53.058 --> 53:55.049
Taxi!

53:57.463 --> 53:59.055
Taxi!

53:59.132 --> 54:02.067
Taxi.!
Taxi.!

54:04.638 --> 54:07.106
Let me get in here.

54:07.174 --> 54:09.836
It's a little tight.
Pardon moi, senor.

54:18.120 --> 54:22.454
- Pier 6, the Sun Princess.
- Pier 5, the Windsong, please.

54:22.525 --> 54:24.551
- You!
- You!

54:24.628 --> 54:27.096
- I'm terribly sorry,
- I'm terribly excited...

54:27.164 --> 54:29.148
but it's imperative I return
to my ship immediately.

54:29.161 --> 54:30.031
I'd be so pleased...

54:30.100 --> 54:32.695
- You can have the cab after that!
- Thank you.

54:32.770 --> 54:35.238
- The Sun Princess.
- The Windsong, please.

54:35.306 --> 54:38.242
We're in real
trouble now, Ocho.

54:38.310 --> 54:42.076
And full steam ahead.!

54:46.620 --> 54:49.487
Where in blazes
are you going, driver?

54:49.556 --> 54:51.457
No comprendo, senor.

54:51.525 --> 54:54.790
You people comprendo enough
when you want to!

54:54.862 --> 54:56.887
Wait a minute.

54:58.634 --> 55:01.899
It's that same kid!

55:01.970 --> 55:05.600
And here's the biggie:
I think it's the same car.

55:05.675 --> 55:09.839
It's a ghost.
Let me outta here!

55:09.912 --> 55:13.479
Let me outta here, or
it's the yardarm for you!

55:13.492 --> 55:15.351
Can't stop now, senor.

55:21.059 --> 55:24.928
- Look!
- Oh! Uh...

55:24.997 --> 55:28.364
- Melissa! Melissa!
- Help, help!

55:28.434 --> 55:31.461
Help!
I'm being shanghaied!

55:31.538 --> 55:34.006
Help, Melissa.!

55:34.074 --> 55:36.042
Help!
I'm being shanghaied!

55:36.109 --> 55:38.544
The kid,
he robbed us again!

55:38.613 --> 55:41.514
- He shanghaied them.
- Shanghai?

55:46.855 --> 55:50.791
Senor, stop!
Could you please stop?

55:52.562 --> 55:55.360
Por favor, alto.!

55:56.800 --> 56:00.237
Por favor, alto.
Please stop.

56:07.546 --> 56:11.004
Por favor, senor.!
Muchas gracias.

56:11.083 --> 56:14.144
- How much?
- How far you want to go?

56:14.220 --> 56:17.348
No, how much
for the whole bus?

56:17.423 --> 56:19.187
Huh?

56:19.259 --> 56:21.887
Is $340 enough?

56:24.998 --> 56:27.934
Lady,
you got yourself a bus!

56:28.002 --> 56:30.027
Next bus, please.

56:30.105 --> 56:33.166
Todos para fuera.
Acabo de vender el bus.!

56:41.585 --> 56:44.213
Now, listen to me, son.

56:44.287 --> 56:47.257
If you don't release me
this instant...

56:47.325 --> 56:51.193
I'll have you tied to a cannon
to be discharged at sunset.!

56:51.262 --> 56:53.254
I can't stop.

56:53.332 --> 56:56.392
Two men said that they would
cut up Ocho in little pieces...

56:56.468 --> 56:59.131
and two other men
are very mad at me.

57:02.108 --> 57:04.736
Is that banging noise new?

57:04.811 --> 57:07.610
Just louder.
It might throw a rod.

57:07.681 --> 57:11.583
- Uh, is that serious?
- Not if it happens in front of a hotel.

57:17.959 --> 57:19.985
Are we still in Panama?

57:20.062 --> 57:24.021
- Panama's long gone, capitan.
- What? Let me out of here.!

57:26.203 --> 57:29.263
Can't, capitan.
There's some men after me!

57:31.341 --> 57:34.277
No, Ocho,
not in there!

57:42.321 --> 57:45.154
- OlÃ©!
- What was that?

57:45.224 --> 57:47.318
We're at the bullfights,
capitan.

57:49.029 --> 57:51.520
Oh, this is exciting.

57:51.598 --> 57:55.831
- I think it will be, senora.
- What did he mean by that?

57:55.903 --> 57:58.804
God bless you.

58:07.016 --> 58:09.610
Turn in there!

58:20.699 --> 58:22.894
- This can't be right.
- Back up!

58:29.108 --> 58:30.632
Oh!

58:30.710 --> 58:33.305
We're goin'in.!

58:48.831 --> 58:52.858
- What are we gonna do?
- Just ignore him.

58:59.309 --> 59:01.710
Saquen esos carros
de la plaza.!

59:04.782 --> 59:08.082
Vamonos, hombre.!
Pero saquense de aqui. Estan locos.

59:08.153 --> 59:10.383
Pero orale,
afuera, hombre.!

59:19.365 --> 59:21.960
Come on,
get it off the car!

59:42.192 --> 59:45.059
Come on!

01:00:04.718 --> 01:00:06.743
Oh... Oooh!

01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:11.417
Alto, ya parenle,
basta, ya basta.!

01:00:11.492 --> 01:00:13.926
Please get us
out of here, kid.

01:00:13.996 --> 01:00:17.022
I'm not asking for myself,
but I'm very worried about this lady.

01:00:17.099 --> 01:00:19.533
- How thoughtful!
- Just shut up!

01:00:19.601 --> 01:00:23.936
- Pasen por esa puerta, rapido.!
- Si, senor policia.

01:00:24.007 --> 01:00:27.842
That first gangway.! Move it.!

01:00:27.911 --> 01:00:29.936
Aaah!

01:00:30.014 --> 01:00:32.312
Get goin Ocho.!

01:00:32.383 --> 01:00:34.716
Aaah!

01:00:34.786 --> 01:00:37.778
Ay, que viene el toro.!

01:00:39.891 --> 01:00:43.828
- We're stopped. Where's the bull?
- There he is.

01:00:43.896 --> 01:00:46.831
What a magnificent animal.

01:00:46.899 --> 01:00:50.233
- I think you can see him
better from here.
- Aaah!

01:00:51.538 --> 01:00:53.403
Aaah!

01:00:53.473 --> 01:00:57.467
Hey, Ocho, we gonna let him
get away with that?

01:00:57.545 --> 01:01:00.708
Yes, you are!
Let's get out of here!

01:01:12.095 --> 01:01:15.156
Scat, scat, scat.!

01:01:15.232 --> 01:01:19.532
Ocho, he's gonna kill ya!
You just can't stand here doin' nothin'!

01:01:19.603 --> 01:01:24.337
You gotta fight!
Take a good look at him!

01:01:25.944 --> 01:01:28.880
He's a killer.!

01:01:31.584 --> 01:01:35.612
- He is going to fight.
- That-a-boy, Ocho!

01:01:38.625 --> 01:01:41.423
I can't believe this.

01:01:41.496 --> 01:01:44.863
Thirty years at sea,
and I'm going to die in a bullring.

01:01:49.371 --> 01:01:52.033
Hey, toro, toro.!

01:01:52.108 --> 01:01:55.704
Toro.! Hey, toro.!
Toro, toro.!

01:01:55.779 --> 01:01:59.306
- No toros! Shhh!
- Toro.!

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:02.477
Toro, toro.!
Andale, toro, aqui.!

01:02:04.388 --> 01:02:05.912
Hey, toro.!

01:02:08.159 --> 01:02:11.095
Good, Ocho!

01:02:11.163 --> 01:02:13.961
That-a-boy, Ocho!
Stay with him!

01:02:14.032 --> 01:02:15.625
Ole, Ocho.!

01:02:47.771 --> 01:02:51.503
Atta boy, Ocho!
You take him now!

01:02:51.576 --> 01:02:56.344
Look, son, I want you to know
that I think of you as my son.

01:02:56.415 --> 01:03:00.215
If you get us out of here, I'll make you
first mate of the Sun Princess.

01:03:00.286 --> 01:03:02.721
You and your little car
can stay in a nice suite...

01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:05.019
and eat at my table
every night.

01:03:05.091 --> 01:03:09.290
The big boat will take you
anywhere you want to go, okay?

01:03:09.363 --> 01:03:12.161
Don't worry, capitan,
we got him now!

01:03:17.372 --> 01:03:21.308
Over here, toro.!
Over here!

01:03:21.376 --> 01:03:23.971
Ole.!

01:03:24.047 --> 01:03:28.143
Hey, toro, toro.!
That-a-boy, Ocho!

01:03:28.218 --> 01:03:31.518
He's getting
awfully close, Ocho.!

01:03:33.324 --> 01:03:35.885
- Aaah!
- I'm going to be sick.

01:03:35.961 --> 01:03:38.327
They got voodoo down here,
you know that?

01:04:12.969 --> 01:04:16.633
Ole! Ole!

01:04:20.878 --> 01:04:24.406
He's had enough. Let's go.

01:04:40.901 --> 01:04:42.926
Come on.

01:04:54.183 --> 01:04:57.585
They want us to take a bow,
all of us!

01:05:00.891 --> 01:05:03.326
Oh, wait.
Come out.

01:05:03.394 --> 01:05:05.847
Nothing in this world will
induce me to go out there.

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:07.091
They'll be disappointed.

01:05:07.165 --> 01:05:09.429
Don't pull on me!
Don't do that!

01:05:13.672 --> 01:05:16.163
Mmm! Ahhh!

01:05:23.083 --> 01:05:26.645
You too, capitan.
Take a bow!

01:05:57.156 --> 01:05:59.056
Oof!

01:06:02.795 --> 01:06:05.390
What's wrong, Ocho?

01:06:07.567 --> 01:06:09.262
Oh!

01:06:16.511 --> 01:06:18.776
Wait a minute!

01:06:20.349 --> 01:06:24.912
- I told you.
- Let's get Shepard and the plane!

01:06:24.988 --> 01:06:27.513
Captain, the boy!

01:06:29.125 --> 01:06:32.789
That boy's in trouble!
Help him! Help!

01:06:45.111 --> 01:06:49.241
- Can't we go any faster?
- We could, but we'd have to walk.

01:06:49.315 --> 01:06:51.750
The fact that we're
moving at all violates...

01:06:51.819 --> 01:06:54.941
every principle of the
internal combustion engine.

01:06:54.954 --> 01:06:56.313
Hey, wait a minute.

01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:58.825
It's Aunt Louise.

01:06:58.893 --> 01:07:02.192
And Captain Blythe?

01:07:02.263 --> 01:07:05.461
Aunt Louise,
are you all right?

01:07:05.534 --> 01:07:08.025
Ecstatic.
Well!

01:07:08.104 --> 01:07:12.337
We just fought a bull,
and brought it to a standstill.

01:07:12.409 --> 01:07:15.469
Looks like you lost, Captain.

01:07:15.545 --> 01:07:17.980
Reverse your course.

01:07:18.049 --> 01:07:21.780
We have to find that boy.
There's some men after him.

01:07:27.793 --> 01:07:30.387
What if he
doubled-back on us?

01:07:30.462 --> 01:07:33.523
We'd have seen him.
There's only one road around here.

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:36.034
Just keep looking
for that crazy car.

01:07:42.776 --> 01:07:46.474
He doesn't understand "bracket."

01:07:46.548 --> 01:07:48.982
All right, then,
get some wire.

01:07:49.050 --> 01:07:51.542
- Wire, wire.
- Wire?

01:07:51.621 --> 01:07:54.146
- Wire, uh, wire.
- Wire.

01:07:54.223 --> 01:07:56.214
Sounds like "fire."

01:07:56.292 --> 01:07:59.729
Ah, si.!
Fuego, si.

01:07:59.796 --> 01:08:03.232
- He's gonna get some.
- Thank you.

01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:06.930
- Uh...
- Fuego.

01:08:07.005 --> 01:08:10.168
Um, senor, no.
Mm-mm.

01:08:10.241 --> 01:08:13.507
- The Sun Princess.
- Como se llama?

01:08:13.579 --> 01:08:16.673
Tell the mate I've been
stranded in Timbio.

01:08:16.749 --> 01:08:18.944
No puedo.
No le entiendo.

01:08:19.019 --> 01:08:23.011
- The Sun Princess! It's a ship!
- Sheep.

01:08:23.089 --> 01:08:27.527
- Now... No, not a sheep. It's a ship.
- Princesa es sheep.

01:08:27.595 --> 01:08:31.053
Not sheep. That's "baa-baa"!
This is "toot-toot"!

01:08:31.131 --> 01:08:34.227
- No comprendo, no.
- What do you mean, "no comprende"?

01:08:34.303 --> 01:08:37.100
In St. Augustine,
not far from here...

01:08:37.171 --> 01:08:40.040
they have monolithic
statues that are...

01:08:40.109 --> 01:08:42.542
Well, they go back
to 500 B. C...

01:08:42.612 --> 01:08:45.582
but nobody knows who made them
or where they came from.

01:08:45.649 --> 01:08:48.345
I wish I could help you.

01:08:50.654 --> 01:08:54.785
I'm sure you'd find a cold
six-pack much more exciting.

01:08:57.729 --> 01:09:01.426
Oh, now, have I hit on something
that you hold dear and sacred?

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:04.594
Look, I led you on.
I apologized.

01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:06.662
Oh, please, don't.

01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:09.937
Well, I'll just have an
electrocardiogram when I get home.

01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:12.444
But I can assure you,
there's been no damage.

01:09:12.513 --> 01:09:15.140
We're wasting
valuable time bickering.

01:09:15.216 --> 01:09:18.276
Who knows what's
happened to that boy by now?

01:09:18.353 --> 01:09:21.790
I'll just see what's
holding up the captain.

01:09:23.024 --> 01:09:25.323
Why are you all
staring at me?

01:09:25.394 --> 01:09:27.828
It's a conspiracy!
What?

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:30.263
Si, sesenta centavos.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:32.631
Siesta centavos.

01:09:32.703 --> 01:09:34.966
Don't go away.
I'll get it for you.

01:09:35.038 --> 01:09:38.099
- Siesta centavos.
- Sesenta centavos, senor.

01:09:38.175 --> 01:09:41.042
- Three minutes more
cost you more money.!
- Siesta centavos.

01:09:42.747 --> 01:09:44.340
Oh, here.

01:09:44.416 --> 01:09:47.283
Yes, we're getting it for you.
I beg you, don't hang up.

01:09:47.353 --> 01:09:49.344
Yes, I'll be
right with you.

01:09:49.421 --> 01:09:52.790
I love your country.
It's very colorful.

01:09:52.859 --> 01:09:56.296
Your children have
such expressive faces.

01:09:56.363 --> 01:09:58.661
Look alive with
that change, woman!

01:09:58.732 --> 01:10:01.497
Please don't go away.
I'll get it for you.

01:10:04.272 --> 01:10:07.367
Are you still there?
Hello?

01:10:07.443 --> 01:10:09.911
Hello?

01:10:09.979 --> 01:10:12.004
Hello!

01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:16.344
She's gone.

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:18.854
It took me two hours
just to get the operator...

01:10:18.922 --> 01:10:21.323
and she's gone,
just like that.

01:10:21.392 --> 01:10:24.555
- Oh.
- Hello?

01:10:24.629 --> 01:10:28.088
Oh, yes, de nada.

01:10:28.167 --> 01:10:30.397
How will I explain this
to the company?

01:10:30.469 --> 01:10:32.937
You just tell Aunt Louise
all about it.

01:10:33.006 --> 01:10:35.668
- They'll take away my command.
- Yes, oh.

01:10:35.742 --> 01:10:39.542
- They'll take away my sheep.
- Oh, your sheep.

01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:49.718
I think we lost 'em,
but one thing I still can't figure out

01:10:49.791 --> 01:10:53.785
Why would those men want
a picture like this, Ocho?

01:10:56.532 --> 01:10:59.399
It's kinda lonely
around here, huh, Ocho?

01:10:59.469 --> 01:11:01.461
Honk-honk.

01:11:01.538 --> 01:11:03.870
When we're safe
from those men...

01:11:03.941 --> 01:11:07.505
we'll go back where there's
lots of people, huh, Ocho?

01:11:07.518 --> 01:11:08.709
Honk!

01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:10.975
We've got him.!

01:11:11.049 --> 01:11:13.279
Why don't we
force him off the road?

01:11:13.352 --> 01:11:16.219
Because we just might
come off second best.

01:11:16.288 --> 01:11:18.950
Well, what's a bug
and a kid gonna do?

01:11:19.024 --> 01:11:22.483
Something quite unexpected,
I assure you.

01:11:22.562 --> 01:11:24.723
We'll wait 'til it stops.

01:11:33.074 --> 01:11:35.270
Will it make
Chiclayo?

01:11:35.344 --> 01:11:37.778
Not a prayer.

01:11:37.846 --> 01:11:40.338
- How long do you give it?
- About a minute.

01:11:40.417 --> 01:11:44.683
We should alert the captain.
He'd want to know about this.

01:11:44.754 --> 01:11:48.953
He'll be alerted,
any second now.

01:12:00.673 --> 01:12:03.801
Sound general quarters!

01:12:03.876 --> 01:12:07.813
- Captain!
- It's every man for himself!

01:12:07.881 --> 01:12:10.509
Have you put out
distress signals?

01:12:10.584 --> 01:12:13.986
Oh, we will.
Five of them.

01:12:23.032 --> 01:12:26.229
Maybe we can go to Santiago
and work there, Ocho.

01:12:26.302 --> 01:12:28.965
Those men'll
never find us there.

01:12:29.039 --> 01:12:31.872
Don't worry, Ocho.
I'll take care of ya.

01:12:31.942 --> 01:12:35.879
Oye, nino. El senor
en la cantina necesita un taxi.

01:12:35.947 --> 01:12:39.075
- Andale, pronto. Apurate.
- Si.!

01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:43.247
Wake up, Ocho!
A man in the cantina needs a taxi.

01:12:43.322 --> 01:12:46.189
We can siesta later.

01:13:06.515 --> 01:13:10.680
- Someone want a taxi?
- Just the driver.

01:13:17.327 --> 01:13:19.795
Ow! Let go!

01:13:20.964 --> 01:13:23.798
Let me go.!

01:13:23.868 --> 01:13:26.928
No! Let me go!

01:13:32.845 --> 01:13:34.574
Aaah!

01:13:34.648 --> 01:13:36.639
Ocho!

01:13:41.822 --> 01:13:43.813
Ocho!

01:13:45.159 --> 01:13:47.150
Ocho!

01:13:53.535 --> 01:13:55.561
Let me go.!
Help.!

01:14:00.743 --> 01:14:03.076
Ocho!

01:14:21.334 --> 01:14:23.269
Bye-bye.

01:14:23.337 --> 01:14:25.805
How's it going?

01:14:25.872 --> 01:14:28.306
I'm telling them not to hold
the ship at Port au Spain...

01:14:28.375 --> 01:14:31.607
but go directly to Tobago,
where I'll join them there.

01:14:31.679 --> 01:14:34.739
I hate to think of what's happened
to that ship in my absence.

01:14:34.816 --> 01:14:38.947
Get this off immediately.
It goes to the Communication
Center of the Sun Princess.

01:14:39.021 --> 01:14:41.649
Are you certain that
the pigeon understands that?

01:14:41.724 --> 01:14:45.456
Si, senor capitan.

01:14:45.528 --> 01:14:48.053
He certainly knows
his pigeons.

01:14:48.131 --> 01:14:51.067
There's an airport in Chiclayo,
about 12 miles further on.

01:14:51.135 --> 01:14:54.195
But there's no transportation
from here to Chiclayo.

01:14:57.876 --> 01:15:00.310
It's the same car.!

01:15:00.379 --> 01:15:02.905
I was so worried.
Thank heavens.!

01:15:06.552 --> 01:15:09.147
It's the same car,
but where's the boy?

01:15:09.223 --> 01:15:11.885
I think he wants to tell us something.

01:15:11.959 --> 01:15:15.258
It's a car, woman,
not Lassie.

01:15:15.329 --> 01:15:18.561
- Where is Paco?
- Honk-honk-honk.

01:15:18.633 --> 01:15:21.067
I know something terrible's
happened to him. Come on.

01:15:21.136 --> 01:15:23.162
Get in, everybody.
Get in!

01:15:23.239 --> 01:15:26.333
I am not getting into
that sardine can again!

01:15:26.409 --> 01:15:30.710
- It's a 12-mile walk to Chiclayo,
so make up your mind.
- And hurry!

01:15:30.781 --> 01:15:33.409
- Get in here!
- Ow!

01:15:33.483 --> 01:15:36.544
Oh! Aaah!

01:15:38.456 --> 01:15:41.914
What about that down there?

01:15:41.993 --> 01:15:44.360
Yeah,
that could be it.

01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:50.831
Gentlemen,
we're right on the money.!

01:16:00.915 --> 01:16:04.408
Together now, pull.!

01:16:15.131 --> 01:16:17.327
What do you think?

01:16:17.401 --> 01:16:20.427
Gold.!
Probably pure gold.!

01:16:22.974 --> 01:16:26.000
More than that,
it has tremendous archaeological value.

01:16:26.077 --> 01:16:28.637
- Do you think there's more?
- Plenty.

01:16:28.713 --> 01:16:30.944
What do we do with it?

01:16:31.016 --> 01:16:33.007
I say we get this
outta here now...

01:16:33.085 --> 01:16:37.352
then come back with tools
and do it up right, okay?

01:16:37.424 --> 01:16:39.449
You got it.

01:16:44.398 --> 01:16:47.299
- What about me?
- Get outta here!

01:16:47.368 --> 01:16:50.031
Aaah!

01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:52.767
I don't like leavin'
that kid back there.

01:16:52.841 --> 01:16:55.469
Don't worry about him.
He's not goin'anywhere.

01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:59.905
Does anyone know
where we are?

01:16:59.983 --> 01:17:02.417
The car does.
I'm sure of it.

01:17:02.485 --> 01:17:06.115
Well, ask it, will you?
I would, but we're not
on speaking terms.

01:17:06.190 --> 01:17:09.557
This is ridiculous.
Somebody ought to do something.

01:17:09.627 --> 01:17:13.621
- We'd better just sit tight.
- Easy for you.

01:17:55.479 --> 01:17:58.108
Aaah!

01:18:21.810 --> 01:18:23.903
Ocho!

01:18:33.257 --> 01:18:36.317
Paco, what are you doing here
in the middle of the jungle?

01:18:36.393 --> 01:18:40.194
- We were worried sick about you.
- Those men, they were stealing gold.

01:18:40.265 --> 01:18:42.290
Big gold, like this.!

01:18:42.367 --> 01:18:46.464
- Where'd they get gold?
- Right there. It looks like Inca ruins.

01:18:46.538 --> 01:18:50.873
Si. It's Inca. They will
fly away the gold and they
will melt it. I hear them.

01:18:50.944 --> 01:18:54.505
I'll see that the matter
is brought to the attention
of the proper authorities...

01:18:54.581 --> 01:18:56.606
when we put in at Rio.

01:18:56.683 --> 01:18:59.847
That might be too late.
Go, Ocho.!

01:19:05.193 --> 01:19:07.821
What's that?

01:19:07.896 --> 01:19:12.163
Come on, give us a hand!
Let's keep movin'!

01:19:14.203 --> 01:19:17.970
Oh, no.!
It's that car.!

01:19:19.877 --> 01:19:21.504
It ate it.!
It ate the gold.!

01:19:21.578 --> 01:19:25.572
How'd it get out here?

01:19:29.054 --> 01:19:33.389
- There goes a million bucks.
- No way.

01:19:48.209 --> 01:19:52.044
Seven hundred miles on
a banana boat with wheels.

01:19:52.114 --> 01:19:54.514
I'll be laughed off
the Caribbean.

01:19:54.583 --> 01:19:56.574
It worked, didn't it?

01:19:56.652 --> 01:19:59.144
Those men in the airplane,
they couldn't find us.

01:19:59.222 --> 01:20:01.884
It was a good idea, Paco.
How much farther?

01:20:01.958 --> 01:20:03.983
We're practically there.

01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:07.189
Okay, get ready
to peel off.

01:20:07.264 --> 01:20:09.824
Hmm, sorry.

01:20:18.378 --> 01:20:21.404
We're looking for
Dr. De Moraes'offce.

01:20:21.481 --> 01:20:24.245
He's upstairs,
in the main building.

01:20:24.317 --> 01:20:27.082
I'll call the police.

01:20:27.154 --> 01:20:28.883
Hello.

01:20:28.956 --> 01:20:31.117
You go on.
I'll wait here.

01:20:31.191 --> 01:20:32.887
Aaah!

01:20:32.961 --> 01:20:36.556
May I use your phone?
It's very important. Oh, thank you.

01:20:36.631 --> 01:20:38.896
Hey!

01:20:38.968 --> 01:20:43.268
Are you going towards the sea?
It's vitally important
I return to my ship!

01:20:43.339 --> 01:20:45.365
Wait, wait!

01:20:47.544 --> 01:20:50.570
Dr. De Moraes?

01:20:50.647 --> 01:20:52.980
Yes?

01:20:53.051 --> 01:20:55.451
Oh, Dr. De Moraes...

01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:59.617
you have no idea what
we've gone through to get this to you.

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:04.220
And what we've gone through
to get it from you.

01:21:04.296 --> 01:21:06.731
When we couldn't
find you on the highway...

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:09.963
we decided that you'd either gone
to the nearest police station...

01:21:10.036 --> 01:21:14.497
or to the world's foremost
authority on Inca civilization.

01:21:14.575 --> 01:21:17.373
I guessed right.

01:21:18.813 --> 01:21:21.874
Nice, ripe bananas.
They're good for brains.

01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:25.386
Get 'em while they last.
Very cheap.

01:21:25.454 --> 01:21:29.221
Nice, ripe bananas.
Let's make a deal on a peel.

01:21:29.292 --> 01:21:31.726
Let's do
this thing together.

01:21:31.794 --> 01:21:34.286
We don't want this
to get away from us.

01:21:39.804 --> 01:21:43.501
Ocho, listen. Sounds like
the airplane those men had!

01:21:43.575 --> 01:21:45.566
Let's go see!

01:21:55.122 --> 01:21:57.522
They can't do anything.
Come on.

01:21:57.591 --> 01:22:01.084
Ocho, what are we gonna do?
They're taking the gold!

01:22:05.333 --> 01:22:07.666
Atta boy, Ocho!

01:22:09.004 --> 01:22:12.941
Wh-Wh-Whoa!

01:22:13.009 --> 01:22:15.204
Sorry, boss.!

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:20.182
Get this thing off of me!

01:22:20.251 --> 01:22:22.549
Hit 'em again,
Ocho!

01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:25.248
You idiot!

01:22:25.322 --> 01:22:29.453
- Hey, come on! Hurry up!
- Get this thing off of me!

01:22:34.467 --> 01:22:37.197
Give me that thing!

01:22:39.338 --> 01:22:42.797
I can't get a grip on it.!

01:22:42.876 --> 01:22:45.970
Let's do this
scientifically.

01:22:46.046 --> 01:22:48.572
Pull! Push!

01:22:52.387 --> 01:22:55.050
Cut it out, will ya?

01:23:00.630 --> 01:23:03.326
Get off of my foot!

01:23:04.568 --> 01:23:07.060
Help me get it
to the plane.

01:23:08.873 --> 01:23:11.501
I can't see!

01:23:11.576 --> 01:23:13.807
Whoa!

01:23:18.150 --> 01:23:20.619
Hurry up, pilot!

01:23:20.687 --> 01:23:23.679
Ready... fire.!

01:23:30.364 --> 01:23:33.425
Say what you want
about voodoo...

01:23:33.501 --> 01:23:36.265
but where I come from,
cars don't throw bananas.

01:23:36.338 --> 01:23:39.068
Just get it
in the plane!

01:23:51.121 --> 01:23:54.353
Ocho, they're getting away.
Hurry!

01:24:08.475 --> 01:24:11.205
Come on, let's get
this thing outta here!

01:24:11.278 --> 01:24:16.148
With this extra weight, I'm gonna need
the whole field to take off!

01:24:16.217 --> 01:24:19.243
Well, hurry up!
Here it comes again!

01:24:28.498 --> 01:24:30.932
You think he's gonna
try and hijack us?

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.662
Anything's possible with that thing.

01:24:34.972 --> 01:24:36.906
Get 'em, Ocho!
Stay with 'em!

01:24:41.046 --> 01:24:44.538
- I wonder what it's gonna do now.
- I don't know.

01:24:44.616 --> 01:24:46.379
Well, take off!

01:24:46.451 --> 01:24:48.943
- Come on, take off!
- I'm trying!

01:24:50.756 --> 01:24:54.352
- Right on our tail.
- I think he's tryin' to chew it off.

01:24:54.428 --> 01:24:56.896
Do we need one?

01:24:58.999 --> 01:25:01.127
Now, Ocho, get him!

01:25:06.541 --> 01:25:09.010
Don't let go!
That-a-boy!

01:25:10.279 --> 01:25:13.578
Shake 'em, Ocho!
Shake 'em, man.

01:25:20.623 --> 01:25:24.720
I can't take off with all that
weight in the tail. Go get it!

01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:30.465
- Catch it when I raise the tail.
- Gotcha.!

01:25:32.404 --> 01:25:34.031
Aaah!

01:25:36.476 --> 01:25:38.569
Go for it, Ocho, now!

01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:42.611
Hang on!

01:25:45.352 --> 01:25:47.786
Shake it off!

01:25:53.361 --> 01:25:56.820
Come on, Ocho, you can't give up now!
They're getting away!

01:26:12.850 --> 01:26:16.048
He's going to ram us.!

01:26:16.121 --> 01:26:19.682
- Aaah!
- Do something!

01:26:22.629 --> 01:26:26.690
- Why are we going in circles?
- Because he broke my tail, that's why!

01:26:34.375 --> 01:26:38.437
Now get in front of'em!
Make 'em stop!

01:26:38.513 --> 01:26:40.310
Get this thing
off the ground!

01:26:47.290 --> 01:26:50.055
We're gonna hit him!
Pull up!

01:26:50.127 --> 01:26:52.789
She's stalling.!

01:27:05.544 --> 01:27:08.445
They're still going, Ocho!

01:27:14.054 --> 01:27:16.285
- What's the matter?
- The throttle jammed open!

01:27:18.559 --> 01:27:20.493
My wings!

01:27:22.164 --> 01:27:24.894
You hurt, Ocho?

01:27:24.967 --> 01:27:26.958
You don't sound so good.

01:27:27.035 --> 01:27:30.301
Don't quit now.
You can do it!

01:27:30.373 --> 01:27:33.809
- Can you step it up?
- I'm hurrying.

01:27:33.877 --> 01:27:38.247
- Move your feet forward.
- I got it, I got it.

01:27:38.315 --> 01:27:40.408
Uh, uh...

01:27:40.484 --> 01:27:42.783
Policia.!

01:27:42.854 --> 01:27:45.982
I'm so glad you're here.
I was the one who called you.

01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:52.458
Stay with 'em!
Go, go!

01:27:55.836 --> 01:27:58.464
Can't you make this thing
go any faster?

01:27:58.539 --> 01:28:01.940
The oil pressure's down.
I don't want to ruin my plane.

01:28:10.519 --> 01:28:13.181
They got the gold!

01:28:18.295 --> 01:28:20.695
Stop! You'll never get away!

01:28:20.764 --> 01:28:23.199
We're right behind you!

01:28:31.143 --> 01:28:34.374
Okay, Ocho, you got 'em now!
Give it to 'em!

01:28:35.547 --> 01:28:37.743
Whoa!

01:28:47.494 --> 01:28:51.864
- You did it!
- Paco, Paco.

01:28:51.933 --> 01:28:55.164
That's him!
Paco, are you all right?

01:28:55.236 --> 01:28:58.832
Ocho and me, we okay.
You ought to see those other guys.

01:29:02.845 --> 01:29:04.837
No se muevan.

01:29:04.915 --> 01:29:07.008
Quedense ahi.

01:29:07.084 --> 01:29:09.211
Todos ustedes,
salganse de ahi.

01:29:09.286 --> 01:29:12.518
Salganse de ahi, les digo.
Yno se muevan.

01:29:44.727 --> 01:29:47.753
Gorgeous!
Just magnificent.

01:29:49.732 --> 01:29:53.191
I've always felt, Captain,
that you have a...

01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:57.833
deep appreciation for beauty.

01:29:57.909 --> 01:30:01.242
I've never seen
anything like it.

01:30:03.481 --> 01:30:06.747
Any man of the sea who wouldn't
want her rolling under him...

01:30:06.819 --> 01:30:09.049
is ready for dry dock!

01:30:11.858 --> 01:30:13.883
Wow!

01:30:20.468 --> 01:30:22.231
Magnificent!

01:30:38.756 --> 01:30:42.317
I'm not admitting the kid's
a better driver than I am...

01:30:42.393 --> 01:30:46.296
but he sure can get more
out of that car than I can.

01:30:46.364 --> 01:30:49.231
- And they're really...
- Simpatico.

01:30:49.301 --> 01:30:51.862
Yeah, simpatico.

01:31:00.214 --> 01:31:01.806
Well?

01:31:04.986 --> 01:31:09.013
If I had billowed out
like a schooner under full sail...

01:31:09.090 --> 01:31:11.184
I might have...

01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:14.559
shivered his timbers.

01:31:14.630 --> 01:31:18.397
- I hope we win this one.
- Don't you worry, Aunt Louise.

01:31:18.468 --> 01:31:21.699
This is the car that's gonna win
the Grand Primeo of Brazil.

01:31:21.772 --> 01:31:23.763
That's right.

01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:26.674
Drivers,
start your engines!

01:31:28.813 --> 01:31:32.011
Paco,
muy bueno.!

01:31:40.093 --> 01:31:42.186
Looking good, Ocho!

01:31:42.262 --> 01:31:45.096
Why do you keep
calling this car "Ocho"?

01:31:45.166 --> 01:31:47.828
"Ocho" means eight.
Can't you read the numbers?

01:31:47.902 --> 01:31:52.465
Sure I can read the numbers.
Five and three are eight.
Anyone knows that.

01:31:55.343 --> 01:32:00.111
Let's have a toast.
To victory in Rio.

01:32:00.183 --> 01:32:02.879
Victory in Rio.!

01:32:02.952 --> 01:32:05.285
A friend

01:32:05.489 --> 01:32:08.788
It takes one to be one

01:32:08.826 --> 01:32:11.955
Takes some time 'til
the light starts shinin'

01:32:12.030 --> 01:32:15.022
On a friendship

01:32:15.099 --> 01:32:18.433
A friend

01:32:18.504 --> 01:32:22.065
Step up if you need one

01:32:22.141 --> 01:32:24.132
Stick out your hand

01:32:24.210 --> 01:32:28.307
They should understand
it's a friendship

01:32:28.381 --> 01:32:31.578
A buenos dias
Come on, try

01:32:31.652 --> 01:32:35.144
A pat on the back
A wink of the eye

01:32:35.223 --> 01:32:38.887
That's what friends are for
and remember this, charro

01:32:38.961 --> 01:32:42.488
They'll stick with you
today and tomorrow

01:32:45.335 --> 01:32:47.565
Amigo

01:32:48.805 --> 01:32:51.832
It's nice if you got one

01:32:51.909 --> 01:32:54.673
But it's nicer
if you're not one to stop

01:32:54.745 --> 01:32:57.111
From lookin'for more

01:32:57.181 --> 01:33:01.642
The world is full of people
who need you so much

01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:05.178
A million hearts there
to touch

01:33:05.257 --> 01:33:07.488
And I bet you a banana

01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:10.188
Manana you'll have
a new friend

01:33:10.263 --> 01:33:13.597
F-R-E-N-D
Friend
