- My deck, my music.
- Yeah, okay.

00:31.271 --> 00:34.849
But since when did you start
getting into musical theater?

00:34.935 --> 00:38.919
Since I saw your mother sign up
for drama in high school.

00:39.268 --> 00:41.599
What, she sang? My mom sang?

00:41.685 --> 00:42.802
We both did.

00:42.888 --> 00:45.575
- You sang?
- (chuckles)

00:45.661 --> 00:47.200
I had no choice.

00:47.340 --> 00:48.739
(grunts)

00:48.850 --> 00:51.271

00:51.521 --> 00:53.974

00:54.122 --> 00:56.607

(indistinct radio chatter)

02:17.349 --> 02:20.130
Duke. What do we got?

02:20.904 --> 02:22.419
A dead window washer.

02:22.615 --> 02:24.490
And I take it
that if we're here,

02:24.638 --> 02:26.532
it wasn't an accident, right?
Definitely not.

02:26.617 --> 02:28.865
The rig came down
because the line was cut.

02:29.707 --> 02:31.032
JUNIOR:
Got a name?

02:31.117 --> 02:33.591
Not yet. He was discovered
early this morning.

02:33.732 --> 02:36.412
No ID or phone on him.
Only thing in his pocket

02:36.497 --> 02:38.162
was a set of keys.
We're trying to match them

02:38.247 --> 02:39.172
with the vehicles in the area.

02:39.257 --> 02:40.922
Fabrique Window Washing Hawaii.

02:41.007 --> 02:43.132
We call this company, might be
able to tell us who this guy is.

02:43.217 --> 02:44.779
Tani's trying
to get ahold of them now.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.935
I also got officers
taking statements.

02:47.021 --> 02:49.833
See if anyone was here
last night and saw something.

02:50.161 --> 02:53.716
STEVE: Okay. So, uh, what do we think?
Why kill a window washer?

02:54.357 --> 02:56.431
JUNIOR: This-this guy spends all
day looking into windows.

02:56.517 --> 02:58.529
Maybe he saw something
he wasn't supposed to.

02:58.615 --> 02:59.982
Maybe.

03:00.067 --> 03:02.849
Maybe he had beef that was
completely unrelated to his job.

03:02.935 --> 03:04.400
They made it look like
a work accident.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.482
JUNIOR: Yeah.
Any luck getting a name?

03:06.576 --> 03:07.724
I actually
can't get ahold

03:07.810 --> 03:09.912
of Fabrique Window Washing
Hawaii because the company

03:09.998 --> 03:11.573
doesn't exist.

03:12.271 --> 03:14.138
So,

03:14.442 --> 03:16.560
what was this guy
doing up there?

03:17.948 --> 03:19.948

03:49.280 --> 03:50.850
GROVER:
So, HPD matched

03:50.936 --> 03:52.163
those keys

03:52.249 --> 03:54.122
that were found in the
vic's pocket to a van

03:54.207 --> 03:56.332
that was parked nearby,
and it's registered

03:56.417 --> 03:58.247
to this individual.

03:59.627 --> 04:01.292
Meet your wannabe
window washer.

04:01.377 --> 04:03.332
Fellow by the name
of James Cooper.

04:03.417 --> 04:06.444
Now, Cooper's a corporate
consultant based out of Miami.

04:06.559 --> 04:08.224
We don't have a local address
on him yet.

04:08.387 --> 04:09.722
But the address

04:09.807 --> 04:13.046
on that registration is
to a vacant lot in Kawailoa.

04:13.210 --> 04:15.905
So this guy has a fake address,
works for a fake company,

04:15.991 --> 04:17.529
and he's 6,000 miles away
from home.

04:17.616 --> 04:19.374
I contacted Miami PD.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.366
I asked them
to go by the guy's apartment.

04:21.490 --> 04:23.538
The doorman there says the guy

04:23.624 --> 04:26.119
- hasn't been there in almost a year.
- JUNIOR: Hmm.

04:26.317 --> 04:28.132
Okay, so,
what's this guy been doing?

04:28.317 --> 04:30.322
Well, I checked his travel
records, you know, just to see

04:30.407 --> 04:31.467
how long he's been
on the island.

04:31.553 --> 04:34.030
This guy is a regular
globe-trotter.

04:34.116 --> 04:35.282
In the last year,

04:35.367 --> 04:38.632
he's been to Boston,
Atlanta, London,

04:38.772 --> 04:41.108
San José in Costa Rica

04:41.257 --> 04:42.874
before landing here
two months ago.

04:42.960 --> 04:44.402
He's a consultant.
Maybe he's going

04:44.488 --> 04:45.793
from client to client.
Right?

04:45.879 --> 04:48.342
STEVE: Yeah. Maybe the consultant thing...
I think it's a cover.

04:48.427 --> 04:50.410
The guy's here
snooping around this building

04:50.496 --> 04:51.592
in the middle of the night.

04:51.677 --> 04:53.887
More like he's-he's casing it
for a robbery.

04:53.973 --> 04:55.768
Pretty ingenious
way to get access,

04:55.899 --> 04:57.444
posing as a
window washer.

04:57.647 --> 04:58.932
All right, Junior,
do me a favor.

04:59.017 --> 05:00.707
Look into all the tenants
that have offices

05:00.793 --> 05:02.091
in that building
and see if any of them

05:02.176 --> 05:03.575
would be obvious targets,
all right?

05:03.660 --> 05:04.683
- Okay.
- Also,

05:04.769 --> 05:06.942
while you're at it,
reach out to HPD Robbery Division.

05:07.027 --> 05:09.395
See if there's been any high-end
burglaries recently. (phone ringing)

05:09.481 --> 05:10.957
- Please.
- Copy.

05:11.042 --> 05:13.042
(clears throat)

05:13.463 --> 05:15.293
- Tani, go ahead. You're on speaker.
- TANI: Hey.

05:15.379 --> 05:16.675
I'm on the roof with Jerry.

05:16.761 --> 05:18.011
I can tell you
the killers

05:18.097 --> 05:19.410
were definitely
here last night.

05:19.504 --> 05:22.738
STEVE: I'm sorry. Did you say
"killers," as in plural?

05:22.824 --> 05:26.580
Yeah. We got fresh shell casings
from two different guns.

05:26.886 --> 05:28.711
Shots were definitely fired

05:28.797 --> 05:30.215
before our vic's rig was cut.

05:30.301 --> 05:32.216
Okay. Didn't expect
to hear that.

05:32.302 --> 05:34.371
Yeah. There's also a lot
of footprints up here,

05:34.472 --> 05:35.871
but fortunately,

05:35.957 --> 05:37.550
the roof is white membrane,

05:37.636 --> 05:40.504
so the silt impressions
are pretty clearly defined.

05:40.590 --> 05:41.801
You said "bunch of footprints"?

05:41.886 --> 05:43.457
Well, hell,
they can belong to anybody.

05:43.543 --> 05:45.022
I mean,
what if it's an office worker

05:45.107 --> 05:46.458
who just went outside
for a smoke break?

05:46.543 --> 05:48.449
The roof is
restricted access,

05:48.535 --> 05:51.347
so the only person that has
the key is the maintenance man.

05:51.723 --> 05:54.027
I'm guessing that our vic
probably picked the lock.

05:54.113 --> 05:56.006
Let's say all those footprints
are from last night.

05:56.091 --> 05:58.206
How long is it gonna take CSU
to sort through them?

05:58.292 --> 06:00.406
Actually, Jerry's
covering that right now.

06:00.492 --> 06:02.019
STEVE:
Is that right?

06:02.254 --> 06:04.964
I got a crime scene
modeling drone.

06:07.007 --> 06:09.347
It'll render a 3-D map
of the entire rooftop,

06:09.433 --> 06:12.136
which should give us the
depth, angle and sole pattern

06:12.222 --> 06:13.800
of every footprint up here.

06:13.896 --> 06:15.448
STEVE: Well, looks like
your new toy picked up

06:15.534 --> 06:17.569
five distinct sets
of footprints now,

06:17.655 --> 06:19.980
but one of them's
all over the place.

06:20.589 --> 06:22.745
Yeah, I'm thinking that's
the maintenance man,

06:22.831 --> 06:24.995
so I'm gonna eliminate that.

06:25.636 --> 06:28.769
These prints match the shoes
of our victim.

06:29.073 --> 06:30.941
They're, uh,
they're concentrated

06:31.027 --> 06:32.684
at the edge of the roof,
which makes sense,

06:32.769 --> 06:34.278
'cause that's where he
was setting up his rig.

06:34.363 --> 06:36.618
Two other sets of footprints
emerge on the roof.

06:36.704 --> 06:37.964
Tani, where'd you say you found

06:38.089 --> 06:40.782
- <i>those shell casings?</i>
- Right here.

06:41.004 --> 06:42.371
Well, that makes sense.

06:42.457 --> 06:44.742
They see Cooper.
They start firing.

06:44.873 --> 06:46.903
Yeah, then Cooper
tries to escape.

06:47.020 --> 06:48.575
Tries to get on the rig,

06:48.661 --> 06:50.037
slide down the side
of the building,

06:50.122 --> 06:51.762
and then our attackers
cut the line.

06:51.903 --> 06:54.301
GROVER: And Mr. Cooper
is quickly introduced

06:54.387 --> 06:55.575
to the sidewalk.

06:55.661 --> 06:58.020
Okay. H-Hold up,
hold up. I got...

06:58.152 --> 07:02.239
I got two sets of prints here
that belong to our assailants.

07:02.325 --> 07:03.450
I got those.

07:03.536 --> 07:05.989
We got one set of prints that
belongs to our victim here.

07:06.075 --> 07:07.879
But what about this other set...

07:08.097 --> 07:09.811
that move away from the action

07:09.897 --> 07:11.129
towards the south exit?

07:11.252 --> 07:13.611
JERRY: According to the
program, those are smaller

07:13.697 --> 07:15.259
and made a shallower impression,

07:15.345 --> 07:16.689
most likely female.

07:16.775 --> 07:18.470
The balls of the feet
were the deepest.

07:18.556 --> 07:20.141
She was running away
from the attackers.

07:20.569 --> 07:22.484
So, if she was with the victim,

07:22.577 --> 07:24.431
what are we thinking?
An accomplice?

07:24.644 --> 07:27.322
Well, whoever she was,
she took the fire escape.

07:27.408 --> 07:29.743
You know what this means?
We have an eyewitness.

07:30.057 --> 07:32.626
We're gonna get the answers
we want soon as we find her.

07:32.712 --> 07:34.853
Yeah, unless the killers
find her first.

07:42.885 --> 07:44.143
Turns out there are
quite a few

07:44.229 --> 07:46.073
things of note
about your window washer.

07:46.322 --> 07:48.541
First, before the fall,
he sustained

07:48.627 --> 07:50.938
a nonfatal bullet wound
to the back of the shoulder.

07:51.280 --> 07:53.090
GROVER: Wow, buddy,
you had some luck.

07:53.176 --> 07:54.437
Survive a gunshot wound

07:54.522 --> 07:56.075
only to plummet to your death.

07:56.161 --> 07:57.366
CUNHA:
Well, the irony is that

07:57.452 --> 07:58.765
even if the fall
hadn't killed him,

07:58.850 --> 08:00.575
he still would've died
within a few months.

08:00.661 --> 08:01.700
How so?

08:01.786 --> 08:03.137
Late-stage bladder cancer.

08:03.223 --> 08:05.311
His lungs show traces
of toluene.

08:05.482 --> 08:07.114
It's a chemical used in fuels,

08:07.200 --> 08:09.115
solvents
and other industrial products.

08:09.201 --> 08:11.747
Prolonged exposure to it has
been linked to bladder cancer,

08:11.833 --> 08:13.676
but this is where it get weird.

08:13.765 --> 08:15.231
It wasn't until I washed off

08:15.332 --> 08:16.966
the blood that I noticed
his fingerprints,

08:17.051 --> 08:18.622
or the lack thereof.

08:19.382 --> 08:21.387
It looks like
he burned them off with acid.

08:21.523 --> 08:23.364
Not to speak ill of
the dead, but that

08:23.458 --> 08:25.129
is downright disgusting.

08:25.278 --> 08:26.481
STEVE:
Well, it's pretty effective,

08:26.567 --> 08:28.536
too, though. I mean,
if this guy's a thief,

08:28.622 --> 08:30.333
it pays to have fingers
that don't leave a print.

08:30.418 --> 08:32.433
The more we learn
about Old Sticky Fingers,

08:32.520 --> 08:34.933
the more about him
just screams "burglar."

08:35.019 --> 08:35.841
(door opens)

08:35.927 --> 08:38.020
So, I looked into all
the offices in that building,

08:38.106 --> 08:40.597
and none of them look like
high-value burglary targets.

08:40.746 --> 08:43.107
You know, you got CPAs,
investment consultants.

08:43.192 --> 08:45.270
- One company makes kids' TV.
- Uh-huh.

08:45.356 --> 08:47.606
I'll bet he wasn't in it
for the alphabet cartoons.

08:47.692 --> 08:48.747
Yeah, I'll tell you
something else.

08:48.832 --> 08:50.529
There's an easier way
to get financial records

08:50.614 --> 08:52.169
than hanging off the side
of a building.

08:52.254 --> 08:53.417
Just the man
I was about to call.

08:53.502 --> 08:55.864
Plus two. CSU processed the van,

08:55.950 --> 08:58.114
and they found a garage door
clicker in the glove box.

08:58.332 --> 08:59.877
Does it have an address on it?

08:59.962 --> 09:02.371
'Cause I-I don't know if
that's gonna help, Jer.

09:02.457 --> 09:04.474
You know, unless you want us
driving around the island

09:04.559 --> 09:06.403
pointing the clicker
at random garages.

09:06.530 --> 09:08.130
Well, we don't have
to cover the whole island.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.677
There are empty cups

09:09.762 --> 09:12.097
from Kope Kahuna Cafe
in the van.

09:12.182 --> 09:13.832
We also found a couple receipts

09:13.918 --> 09:16.543
from gas stations,
and using those locations,

09:16.629 --> 09:18.559
I was able to narrow
the search area

09:18.692 --> 09:21.692
to this half mile-radius
in Kapolei.

09:21.832 --> 09:23.879
And I cloned

09:23.965 --> 09:26.013
the clicker's signal so
we can cover more ground faster.

09:26.098 --> 09:27.327
All right, Jerry, Junior,

09:27.412 --> 09:29.537
get these clickers to HPD.
Help them with the canvass.

09:29.622 --> 09:31.077
Please, let us know
if you get a hit.

09:31.162 --> 09:32.802
Field work. Sweet.
(phone ringing)

09:33.387 --> 09:35.167
Yeah, Adam, what's good?

09:36.145 --> 09:37.450
Hmm. Okay.

09:37.536 --> 09:38.981
Well, text me the address.

09:39.067 --> 09:41.450
So, we got a body off Iwilei.

09:41.536 --> 09:43.130
Adam's gonna need a little
help with the scene.

09:43.215 --> 09:44.387
Busy day out there today.

09:44.473 --> 09:46.450
Bad never rests, baby.
Neither do we.

09:53.387 --> 09:54.926
- Yes, sir.
- So, you get an ID

09:55.012 --> 09:56.739
on old Shirtless
Joe Jackson here?

09:56.825 --> 09:58.840
Not yet.
His wallet's gone,

09:58.926 --> 10:00.302
and his prints
aren't in the system.

10:00.387 --> 10:02.426
Yeah, well,
at least he had prints.

10:02.567 --> 10:04.184
- What?
- Long story.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.333
- Go on.
- Okay.

10:05.419 --> 10:07.043
So, sanitation worker
found the body.

10:07.137 --> 10:08.481
ME says he was strangled.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.934
TOD was sometime
around 3:00 a.m.

10:11.020 --> 10:12.406
He was strangled, all right.

10:12.492 --> 10:14.903
Look at those ligature
marks there. All right,

10:14.989 --> 10:17.059
not very unusual
to find a man

10:17.145 --> 10:18.877
shirtless on Oahu,

10:18.962 --> 10:20.997
but look at his slacks
and shoes.

10:21.083 --> 10:23.059
Clearly this guy was dressed
for an evening out,

10:23.145 --> 10:23.957
not a beach barbecue.

10:24.043 --> 10:25.427
- That's what I was thinking.
- Right.

10:25.512 --> 10:27.757
You know,
the wallet, I get it.

10:27.842 --> 10:28.957
But why literally steal

10:29.043 --> 10:30.575
the shirt off the guy's back?

10:31.175 --> 10:32.845
Have a theory on that.

10:34.510 --> 10:37.379
Maybe what they stole
wasn't any ordinary shirt.

10:37.465 --> 10:39.107
You see this button?

10:39.972 --> 10:41.332
This button's made of bamboo.

10:41.418 --> 10:44.082
So, what-what is this?
Some eco-friendly trend

10:44.168 --> 10:45.614
I don't know about?
(laughs)

10:46.020 --> 10:47.465
Are you serious?

10:48.081 --> 10:51.809
The shirt this button came
from was no ordinary shirt.

10:51.950 --> 10:55.809
It was a shirt that is
impervious to any trend.

10:56.043 --> 10:57.637
It was a work
of fine art.

10:57.723 --> 11:00.403
And if you're looking
for the finest, my friend,

11:00.614 --> 11:02.926
there's only
one game in town.

11:03.011 --> 11:05.011
(bell tinkles)

11:06.007 --> 11:07.810
So this is where you get
your endless collection

11:07.895 --> 11:09.137
of Aloha shirts, huh?

11:09.222 --> 11:10.856
Yeah, well,
we all weren't blessed

11:10.942 --> 11:13.395
with the Noshimuri cheekbones
there, Adam.

11:13.497 --> 11:15.637
You see, some of us have
to make a little effort

11:15.722 --> 11:17.057
to-to look good.

11:17.142 --> 11:18.727
Very little effort,

11:18.812 --> 11:20.270
- mind you.
- Right.

11:20.418 --> 11:21.637
LONO:
Lou.

11:21.723 --> 11:24.268
My man. Hey. Been a
minute, my friend.

11:24.354 --> 11:25.926
What can I help
you with today?

11:26.082 --> 11:27.957
Unfortunately, um,

11:28.043 --> 11:30.192
I need your help
with a homicide investigation.

11:30.300 --> 11:32.223
Take a look
at this button.

11:32.559 --> 11:34.197
<i>♪ Beneath the palm trees ♪</i>

11:34.282 --> 11:36.200
<i>♪ In the early morning... ♪</i>

11:36.286 --> 11:37.348
Bamboo.

11:37.434 --> 11:39.137
Moderately aged.

11:39.424 --> 11:41.786
And the threads
are heavy rayon.

11:42.879 --> 11:45.047
I wouldn't be surprised
if this came off a...

11:45.132 --> 11:48.411
vintage 1950s Royal Hawaiian.

11:48.536 --> 11:49.715
Wow.

11:49.825 --> 11:51.653
Guess that means
it's worth real money.

11:51.739 --> 11:52.879
Couple grand, at least,

11:52.965 --> 11:54.270
especially here.

11:54.356 --> 11:56.607
You thinking our perp might show
up here, trying to unload it?

11:56.692 --> 11:58.004
I hope so.

11:58.090 --> 11:59.871
There are a couple
other places he can go,

11:59.957 --> 12:01.848
but we can have HPD sit
on those.

12:01.937 --> 12:03.442
Thing is,

12:03.800 --> 12:05.996
if the killer knew enough
about this shirt

12:06.145 --> 12:07.629
to recognize its value...

12:07.715 --> 12:09.460
Then they'd know
where to get top dollar.

12:09.546 --> 12:10.711
Boom.

12:10.797 --> 12:12.988

12:13.074 --> 12:15.042

<i>♪ Nobody to love you... ♪</i>

12:29.582 --> 12:32.877
All right, you're too quiet.

12:32.971 --> 12:34.034
(music stops)

12:34.166 --> 12:35.611
Joons, what's going on?

12:35.823 --> 12:37.199
It's nothing.

12:37.635 --> 12:39.547
Come on.

12:41.363 --> 12:42.977
When I was with my dad
this morning,

12:43.062 --> 12:45.897
we found my sister's
old charm bracelet

12:45.982 --> 12:47.238
from when she was ten.

12:47.324 --> 12:49.089
Well, that's not nothing.

12:51.924 --> 12:54.410
You know, after the accident,

12:54.854 --> 12:57.488
you know, when my dad
had told me what had happened

12:57.660 --> 12:59.283
and that Maya was gone...

12:59.377 --> 13:00.386
(clears throat)

13:00.497 --> 13:01.941
he didn't cry.

13:03.019 --> 13:04.894
Not once.

13:05.470 --> 13:07.722
In a weird way,
it was... it was kind of good,

13:07.855 --> 13:09.007
because he was like my rock.

13:09.092 --> 13:10.587
You know, you could've thrown
anything at him

13:10.672 --> 13:13.089
and it would've bounced
right back off.

13:13.621 --> 13:15.222
But now it's...

13:17.136 --> 13:18.269
Well, you're older,

13:18.355 --> 13:20.800
and you, know how much
pain he must be in.

13:20.886 --> 13:23.350
Yeah. And still,
he's like a brick wall.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.473
Like, you should've seen
the way

13:24.558 --> 13:26.425
he shoved this bracelet
into his pocket,

13:26.579 --> 13:28.914
like it was just, like,
a receipt or something.

13:29.062 --> 13:31.777
Wait, are you telling me

13:31.862 --> 13:33.407
that a man that you share

13:33.493 --> 13:35.548
DNA with doesn't like
talking about his feelings?

13:35.642 --> 13:37.282
That's... I'm sorry,

13:37.368 --> 13:38.978
can you fan me
so I don't faint?

13:39.064 --> 13:41.251
'Cause I'm driving, so...
Yeah, thank you. Okay.

13:41.344 --> 13:42.876
Good? Yeah.
That's much better. Yeah.

13:42.961 --> 13:44.961
(exhales)
(laughs)

13:45.177 --> 13:47.171
(phone rings)

13:47.485 --> 13:48.993
Reigns.

13:49.689 --> 13:51.360
All right. Got it.

13:52.042 --> 13:54.384
It's Pua.
They found the place.

14:01.329 --> 14:02.696
What do we know,
Pua?

14:02.782 --> 14:04.642
My partner and I kept eyes
on front and back.

14:04.728 --> 14:06.173
No one's gone in or out.

14:06.349 --> 14:09.759
Okay, so if our mystery woman
really was Cooper's accomplice

14:09.845 --> 14:11.322
and she came back here
after everything

14:11.407 --> 14:13.017
on the roof went south,

14:13.103 --> 14:15.337
that means she could
still be in here.

14:15.423 --> 14:17.555
Good work, Pua.
You want to do the honors?

14:19.218 --> 14:21.218
(door rattling)

14:26.686 --> 14:28.462
Looks like someone's
living here.

14:33.490 --> 14:35.899
Maybe that someone's
behind Door Number One.

14:36.608 --> 14:38.608
(trilling)

14:39.075 --> 14:41.075
(whirring)

14:48.899 --> 14:50.649
What the hell is that?
(beeping)

14:50.735 --> 14:53.165
I don't know.
I don't know.

14:53.251 --> 14:55.056
Yo, yo, yo!
Get down! Get down!

14:55.142 --> 14:56.758
(grunting)

14:56.843 --> 14:58.843
(rapid popping)

15:04.076 --> 15:05.614
(popping stops)
You good?

15:05.700 --> 15:07.642
Yeah.
Can we get some lights?

15:14.894 --> 15:16.657
What the hell?

15:17.707 --> 15:20.665
TANI: So, these are
paint bombs, apparently.

15:20.751 --> 15:23.666
Yeah. They're rigged to go off
like a booby trap.

15:23.894 --> 15:26.769
Look, they got mounted
paintball guns everywhere.

15:26.932 --> 15:28.712
They're all pointed
at the art.

15:29.430 --> 15:30.782
Think it's stolen?

15:30.939 --> 15:32.282
No.

15:32.399 --> 15:35.039
Look at this.
Stencils,

15:35.398 --> 15:37.422
poster paper,

15:37.705 --> 15:39.664
X-Acto knives.

15:40.402 --> 15:42.987
Okay, looks like we had
this guy all wrong.

15:43.375 --> 15:44.641
Cooper wasn't
a thief.

15:44.727 --> 15:46.235
He was an artist.
And, by the looks of it,

15:46.320 --> 15:48.275
he was a graffiti artist.

15:48.536 --> 15:50.375
Guess what's
in spray paint.

15:50.551 --> 15:52.096
Toluene.

15:52.259 --> 15:54.773
It's what Noelani
found in his lungs.

15:55.023 --> 15:57.156
Okay. So,

15:57.337 --> 16:00.281
let's assume Cooper didn't go up
to the building to rob it.

16:00.367 --> 16:03.273
He went there to tag it.
Question is,

16:03.592 --> 16:05.547
who'd want to kill
a street artist?

16:05.734 --> 16:07.109
No idea.

16:07.312 --> 16:09.055
But I know who to ask.

16:10.048 --> 16:11.968
Uh-huh.

16:13.937 --> 16:15.567
Interesting.

16:15.750 --> 16:17.906
Guys, the-the picture,

16:17.992 --> 16:19.062
so to speak,

16:19.168 --> 16:20.832
is coming into focus.

16:20.955 --> 16:23.192
You see
the green-blue

16:23.278 --> 16:25.325
shading pattern
o-on these pieces?

16:25.411 --> 16:27.456
And in these stencils,
the style

16:27.542 --> 16:28.598
of the figures they create,

16:28.683 --> 16:31.746
juxtaposing
an overarching aesthetic

16:31.832 --> 16:34.081
of humanity and pathos.

16:34.167 --> 16:37.269
Add to that
the paint bomb booby trap,

16:37.355 --> 16:40.706
which clearly meant to obscure
the artwork and which speak

16:40.823 --> 16:44.717
to our mystery artist's famously
obsessive need for secrecy.

16:44.802 --> 16:46.717
But the real clincher...

16:46.802 --> 16:49.441
TANI: Oh, the clincher. Yes,
let's get to the clincher,

16:49.527 --> 16:51.026
because this is
a murder investigation

16:51.112 --> 16:52.683
and not an art seminar.

16:53.361 --> 16:55.612
The real clincher

16:55.909 --> 16:58.357
is the signature

16:58.442 --> 17:00.857
panda motif,

17:00.942 --> 17:02.816
just visible here.

17:03.925 --> 17:05.722
Th-There's no doubt in my mind.

17:05.821 --> 17:09.896
Ms. Rey, your investigation
has inadvertently solved

17:10.122 --> 17:12.156
one of the great mysteries

17:12.242 --> 17:14.166
of the modern
art world.

17:14.315 --> 17:16.166
You have found the studio

17:16.291 --> 17:19.597
of the legendary Brikz!

17:25.127 --> 17:26.761
Who's Brikz?

17:26.847 --> 17:28.995
HIRSCH:
Brikz is an anonymous artist.

17:29.081 --> 17:31.267
Works in secret,
mostly at night.

17:31.352 --> 17:32.636
Along with Banksy

17:32.722 --> 17:34.227
and maybe
David Choe,

17:34.357 --> 17:36.557
he's one of the top
street artists in the world.

17:36.732 --> 17:38.437
One look at this image
and you'll see why.

17:38.561 --> 17:39.979
- May-may I?
- Yeah.

17:41.810 --> 17:43.331
- Wow.
- STEVE: Wow.

17:43.442 --> 17:44.878
Impressive.

17:44.964 --> 17:46.667
Mm. I mean, illegal,
but impressive.

17:46.753 --> 17:49.854
Yeah, but I-I'm guessing
that the illegal aspect of this

17:49.940 --> 17:51.143
is part
of the appeal, right?

17:51.229 --> 17:52.407
Oh, mass appeal.

17:52.492 --> 17:54.037
In the space
of a decade,

17:54.122 --> 17:56.457
Brikz went
from anonymous

17:56.542 --> 17:59.457
young Turk tagger
to international gallery star.

17:59.542 --> 18:00.797
JUNIOR: And he really
stayed anonymous

18:00.882 --> 18:02.008
for that whole time?

18:02.094 --> 18:03.995
Well, anonymity was part
of his brand.

18:04.081 --> 18:06.453
It made him very famous.

18:06.539 --> 18:07.687
And extremely rich.

18:07.773 --> 18:09.174
STEVE:
Somebody knew who he was.

18:09.260 --> 18:10.759
Somebody was with him
the night he was killed.

18:10.844 --> 18:11.859
A woman.

18:11.945 --> 18:12.976
As far as I understood,

18:13.062 --> 18:15.024
the only person who knew
his real identity was

18:15.110 --> 18:16.609
his art dealer,
Sterling Jacobs.

18:16.695 --> 18:17.812
Based in New York.

18:17.898 --> 18:20.648
He handled all of Brikz' sales
and publicity.

18:20.734 --> 18:22.086
Okay, well,
it's possible this guy

18:22.172 --> 18:24.984
would have an idea of who
would want his client dead.

18:25.070 --> 18:27.071
So, Junior, why don't you go
get onto this Jacobs guy?

18:27.156 --> 18:28.515
- See what he knows.
- On it.

18:28.984 --> 18:31.242
Oh, and something else
I can tell you.

18:31.328 --> 18:33.265
I-I made some calls
on the way here.

18:33.351 --> 18:35.492
It seems that a number
of Brikz pieces

18:35.578 --> 18:39.273
recently started appearing here
in Honolulu.

18:39.421 --> 18:42.750
STEVE: Okay. But as soon as they
went up, they got defaced.

18:43.211 --> 18:45.140
What do you mean, defaced?
Defaced how?

18:45.226 --> 18:46.429
I'll show you.

18:46.715 --> 18:48.414
A prominent
local art critic

18:48.500 --> 18:51.867
posted an image of one
of the defaced pieces yesterday.

18:52.130 --> 18:54.292
So you're suggesting
that someone committed murder

18:54.378 --> 18:56.297
over spray paint on a wall?

18:56.522 --> 18:57.922
Crossing out someone's work

18:58.008 --> 18:59.922
like that is basically
a death threat.

19:00.272 --> 19:01.945
STEVE: So we find out who defaced

19:02.031 --> 19:04.867
this guy's art,
good chance we find our killer.

19:09.772 --> 19:11.534

19:11.798 --> 19:14.771

19:28.155 --> 19:30.648
This is the craziest thing
I've ever agreed to.

19:30.858 --> 19:32.827
All I know is
our suspects

19:32.913 --> 19:35.585
made sure to deface
every one of Brikz' pieces.

19:35.671 --> 19:38.640
If an undiscovered one comes up,
why wouldn't they hit that, too?

19:38.726 --> 19:41.280
And I'm pretty sure
this is gonna do the trick.

19:45.468 --> 19:47.076
Wow.
It's actually...

19:47.645 --> 19:48.702
It's actually pretty good.

19:48.788 --> 19:51.043
Thanks.
It's, uh...

19:51.129 --> 19:54.085
what I do.
Now, to get the word out

19:54.171 --> 19:56.091
via my Instagram.

19:57.214 --> 19:59.214
(shutter sound effect)

19:59.881 --> 20:01.299
(shutter sound effect)

20:01.514 --> 20:04.059
I'm not exactly an influencer,

20:04.145 --> 20:06.320
but I do have enough followers
that word of my find

20:06.406 --> 20:08.476
should get out
pretty quickly.

20:08.562 --> 20:10.445
"Just found.

20:10.679 --> 20:13.974
"#Undiscovered #Brikz

20:14.277 --> 20:16.570
"#Honolulu

20:16.693 --> 20:18.187
#Kapolei."

20:18.273 --> 20:20.148
#StopSayingHashtag.

20:20.234 --> 20:21.359
Okay.

20:21.493 --> 20:22.915
The trap is set.

20:23.379 --> 20:25.891
Now we just wait.

20:28.265 --> 20:30.265
(bell tinkles)

20:37.013 --> 20:38.973
You buy vintage shirts here,
right?

20:42.112 --> 20:44.317
For a classic piece
like that,

20:44.472 --> 20:46.525
you want to talk
to our appraiser.

20:55.048 --> 20:56.568
Hey.

20:56.770 --> 20:58.462
You need an appraisal?

20:59.581 --> 21:01.719
All right, let me
see what you got.

21:01.805 --> 21:03.195
(grunts)

21:11.003 --> 21:13.581
- Sir, are you aware of
what you have here? - (chuckles)

21:13.667 --> 21:17.298
This is a 1950s Royal
Hawaiian "Hula Dancers"

21:17.384 --> 21:18.751
in rayon.

21:18.836 --> 21:20.032
(exhales)

21:20.554 --> 21:23.538
- We don't get stuff like this coming
through here often. - (chuckles)

21:23.624 --> 21:25.462
Huh. This is...

21:25.603 --> 21:27.267
Uh-oh.

21:27.407 --> 21:29.126
You're missing a button.

21:29.230 --> 21:30.853
- Uh...
- Wait, w-wait.

21:30.939 --> 21:33.734
I have an extra button here
that just might work. Let me...

21:34.634 --> 21:36.187
Lucky day!

21:36.689 --> 21:38.191
(chuckles) It's a perfect match.

21:38.323 --> 21:40.040
Man, if I didn't
know better,

21:40.126 --> 21:43.031
I'd swear this thing came
from this exact same shirt.

21:43.117 --> 21:44.126
(laughs)

21:44.212 --> 21:46.632
Yeah.
W-What can I get for that?

21:46.718 --> 21:48.853
Oh, I'd say about 30 to life.

21:48.938 --> 21:49.983
(grunts)

21:50.143 --> 21:52.239
I didn't kill that dude.
I didn't kill that dude.

21:52.325 --> 21:53.770
He was already dead
when I found him.

21:53.856 --> 21:56.059
I swear.
(groans) I swear.

21:57.833 --> 22:00.020
You have the right
to start running your mouth.

22:00.138 --> 22:01.630
Tell us exactly what happened.

22:01.716 --> 22:03.010
All right,
all right.

22:03.096 --> 22:05.286
I was at this
pai gow poker game, okay?

22:05.387 --> 22:07.341
And that-and that dead dude
was there, too,

22:07.427 --> 22:09.013
and he was on one hell
of a hot streak

22:09.099 --> 22:11.304
'cause he must've won 20 grand
before he cashed out.

22:11.390 --> 22:13.435
Did Mr. Hot Streak have a name?

22:13.521 --> 22:16.786
Uh, Earl... something?

22:16.942 --> 22:18.591
Look, it was my first time
at that game.

22:18.677 --> 22:20.172
Uh, and it was definitely
my last.

22:20.320 --> 22:22.800
When I finally went bust,
I went out the back,

22:23.020 --> 22:24.528
and that dude, Earl,
was out there dead.

22:24.613 --> 22:26.238
All right,
I ain't gonna lie.

22:26.323 --> 22:28.238
I searched his pockets
but his roll was gone,

22:28.323 --> 22:29.998
so whoever killed him
must have taken it.

22:30.192 --> 22:32.153
So I just...

22:32.242 --> 22:34.037
I just took what I could.

22:34.176 --> 22:35.591
Meaning the shirt.

22:35.677 --> 22:38.286
So, obviously, you knew
how valuable it was.

22:38.372 --> 22:40.505
Well, Earl wouldn't shut up
about it the whole night.

22:40.595 --> 22:43.310
He said he got it at an
estate sale for five bucks,

22:43.396 --> 22:45.372
and now it's worth
three or four grand.

22:45.458 --> 22:47.850
I mean, how come stuff happens
to guys like him and never me?

22:47.935 --> 22:50.060
ADAM: If you want to turn
your luck around, pal,

22:50.183 --> 22:53.653
tell us where you and Earl
played pai gow poker last night.

22:55.044 --> 22:56.575
JERRY:
Damn.

22:56.801 --> 22:58.521
I guess that means
no luck, huh?

22:58.618 --> 23:01.163
If I keep trying to hack
my way past this encryption,

23:01.279 --> 23:03.147
the system's gonna
wipe all the data.

23:03.233 --> 23:04.818
I'm gonna have to take
this back to CSU.

23:04.903 --> 23:06.833
The good news is there's
a fingerprint reader.

23:06.919 --> 23:08.958
And this thing is covered
in fingerprints.

23:09.069 --> 23:11.153
Hang on, I thought Brikz burned
his fingerprints off.

23:11.243 --> 23:13.364
Which means that these might
belong to his accomplice.

23:13.481 --> 23:14.911
And if she's an
authorized user,

23:14.997 --> 23:17.091
I could use her prints
to get access.

23:17.231 --> 23:18.708
Did CSU already run 'em?

23:18.794 --> 23:20.059
Yeah. She's not in the system.

23:20.145 --> 23:21.798
But I'll bet you dollars
to malasadas

23:21.884 --> 23:24.098
that whatever's on this
hard drive can help us ID her.

23:24.184 --> 23:26.575
Well, I think I already
beat you to it, buddy.

23:26.763 --> 23:28.348
I found these in a drawer.

23:28.433 --> 23:29.880
You know, most of them

23:29.966 --> 23:32.597
are most likely reference shots,
of in-progress pieces,

23:32.683 --> 23:34.309
but check this one out.

23:35.145 --> 23:36.302
Oh, you think that's her?

23:36.388 --> 23:37.505
JUNIOR:
Yeah, I hope so.

23:37.591 --> 23:39.520
You know, I was thinking
we could run facial rec

23:39.606 --> 23:41.148
if we can separate
those two images.

23:41.233 --> 23:43.567
No doubt. I'll call the lab.
Make a reservation for two.

23:43.661 --> 23:46.747
Wow. Almost 2,500 likes.

23:46.833 --> 23:50.052
Looks like I am a bit of
an influencer after all.

23:50.292 --> 23:52.614
You don't like me
very much, do you?

23:53.439 --> 23:56.712
(scoffs) That's not true. I...

23:56.798 --> 23:58.626
I like... your art.

23:58.712 --> 24:00.141
I think...
(exhales)

24:00.227 --> 24:01.858
I think you're talented,
you're talented.

24:02.140 --> 24:05.039
Thanks.
But I'm not really.

24:05.187 --> 24:07.062
Well, come on.

24:07.148 --> 24:09.973
You just whipped up
an "original" Brikz.

24:10.133 --> 24:13.304
You fooled over
2,400 people so far.

24:13.390 --> 24:16.188
That doesn't make me talented,
it makes me a good forger.

24:16.273 --> 24:19.039
And profiting handsomely for it
from what I've heard.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.773
I made some money...

24:21.720 --> 24:23.726
but I-I wasn't happy.

24:23.975 --> 24:26.547
No matter how many people
my forgeries fooled,

24:26.668 --> 24:29.753
I knew I was just like
my paintings:

24:30.073 --> 24:31.594
a phony.

24:32.010 --> 24:33.617
When I got arrested,

24:33.703 --> 24:36.734
it was kind of a relief.

24:38.378 --> 24:41.320
Cleaning up crime scenes
may not be glamorous, but...

24:42.461 --> 24:45.195
at least I can look at myself
in the mirror every day.

24:46.177 --> 24:48.648
That's something
not everyone can say.

24:49.579 --> 24:50.914
Look at that.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.390
Your scheme might
have actually worked.

24:53.913 --> 24:55.218
Hey.

24:55.386 --> 24:56.846
Get ready to come in.

25:01.984 --> 25:04.515
It's the cops!
Get out of here!

25:08.033 --> 25:09.612
Go! Go! Go! Go!

25:09.698 --> 25:10.947
(indistinct shouting)

25:11.051 --> 25:13.126
Hey! Five-O! Stop!

25:14.623 --> 25:15.623
Stop!

25:21.924 --> 25:23.924
(grunts)

25:40.129 --> 25:42.129
(grunts)

25:42.215 --> 25:43.755
Cuff him.

25:46.693 --> 25:48.693
(grunts, groans)

25:48.779 --> 25:49.864
Ow!

25:49.950 --> 25:52.887
Dude, that really hurt.

25:53.151 --> 25:54.249
(grunts)

25:54.335 --> 25:56.005
Stay down.

25:58.797 --> 26:00.153
Wow.

26:00.239 --> 26:02.614
That was shockingly
well done.

26:03.034 --> 26:07.387
Uh, excuse me while I go throw
up and have a heart attack.

26:07.595 --> 26:09.746
All right, boys,
turn around, please.

26:11.215 --> 26:12.532
Congratulations,

26:12.618 --> 26:14.926
you just defaced a fake Brikz.

26:15.028 --> 26:17.739
I truly hope it was worth
the murder charge.

26:18.368 --> 26:20.243
Wait, what?

26:20.477 --> 26:21.802
We didn't murder anyone.

26:21.888 --> 26:23.517
No. No. I'm sure
he just flung himself

26:23.603 --> 26:24.688
right off the roof, didn't he?

26:24.773 --> 26:26.778
Brikz is dead?
And you think we killed him?

26:26.864 --> 26:28.777
We got nothing but respect
for Brikz.

26:28.863 --> 26:30.129
Man's a legend.

26:30.215 --> 26:32.004
Is that why you were running
all over town

26:32.090 --> 26:33.480
vandalizing his art?

26:33.566 --> 26:35.386
This?
We were paid to do this.

26:35.472 --> 26:36.797
But it's not
what you think.

26:36.883 --> 26:38.621
The paint we use
comes off.

26:38.953 --> 26:41.402
I have a spray bottle
in my backpack. I can show you.

26:41.535 --> 26:42.873
Okay. Don't move.

26:48.173 --> 26:50.423
Okay, Mr. Clean,
show me.

26:59.053 --> 27:01.480
Question: Why?

27:01.723 --> 27:04.082
With what this guy pays,
we weren't asking.

27:04.168 --> 27:05.629
All right.
I'm gonna need a name.

27:05.715 --> 27:07.863
HIRSCH: Meet Sterling
Jacobs, Brikz' agent.

27:07.949 --> 27:11.058
STEVE: I don't get it.
Why would this guy pay somebody

27:11.226 --> 27:13.215
to deface one of his own
client's murals?

27:13.301 --> 27:15.176
My guess, he's taking them off
the market

27:15.262 --> 27:17.933
until a time
in the not-too-distant-future

27:18.073 --> 27:20.051
when the value
is gonna skyrocket.

27:20.137 --> 27:21.566
TANI: That actually
makes a lot of sense,

27:21.652 --> 27:22.902
if you think about it.

27:22.988 --> 27:26.113
Noelani mentioned that the vic
had bladder cancer,

27:26.199 --> 27:27.965
so Jacobs finds out

27:28.051 --> 27:30.441
his superstar client
is on the way out...

27:30.527 --> 27:32.707
Right. And he's looking for
one last chance to cash in.

27:32.793 --> 27:35.175
An original Brikz
captured in the wild

27:35.261 --> 27:36.798
is easily worth six figures.

27:36.883 --> 27:38.758
What do you mean, "captured"?
What? Do they chisel this thing

27:38.843 --> 27:40.027
off the side of a building?

27:40.113 --> 27:42.027
Chisel, chainsaw, whatever.

27:42.113 --> 27:43.238
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:43.324 --> 27:45.051
And our victim probably wasn't
too happy when he found out

27:45.136 --> 27:46.949
- what his agent was doing.
- Definitely not.

27:47.035 --> 27:49.277
They probably got in some
sort of confrontation,

27:49.363 --> 27:51.568
- things got heated...
- Okay.

27:51.653 --> 27:54.988
So Jacobs wants to bump up the
timetable on his client's death.

27:55.074 --> 27:57.488
He hires a couple of shooters,
like he hired the vandals.

27:57.691 --> 28:00.090
We gotta find this guy.
I think I just did.

28:00.229 --> 28:02.734
Look at this. According
to his financials,

28:03.058 --> 28:07.168
Sterling Jacobs got here
one day after his client did.

28:08.583 --> 28:09.918
He's rented
a house in Makaha.

28:10.003 --> 28:11.597
Let's go to Makaha.

28:16.553 --> 28:17.886
TANI:
Clear.

28:24.707 --> 28:26.676
I got a body down here.

28:33.523 --> 28:35.129
Oh, boy...

28:36.991 --> 28:39.347
(exhales) Yeah.

28:39.433 --> 28:41.028
Is that Jacobs?

28:41.222 --> 28:45.449
Yeah. And by the look of it,
he's been dead 24, 36 hours.

28:45.668 --> 28:47.980
Which means that he couldn't
have killed his client.

28:48.425 --> 28:50.027
Although,
I think we just found out

28:50.113 --> 28:52.269
how... our killer figured out.

28:52.355 --> 28:53.871
Brikz' real identity.

28:54.004 --> 28:55.926
Whoever did this to him...
Electrical burns,

28:56.012 --> 28:58.355
they pulled his fingernails out,
God knows what else.

28:58.441 --> 28:59.605
These guys were pros.

28:59.720 --> 29:02.285
Maybe Special Ops,
military intelligence.

29:03.121 --> 29:04.441
What do players like that

29:04.527 --> 29:06.223
want with someone in the art world?

29:07.058 --> 29:08.105
Junior, go ahead.

29:08.191 --> 29:10.551
JUNIOR: I think I've
ID'd Brikz' accomplice.

29:10.641 --> 29:13.222
The lab was able to separate
the double images of her

29:13.308 --> 29:14.688
that we found in the warehouse,

29:14.773 --> 29:16.824
enough to run
facial recognition.

29:16.910 --> 29:19.408
I got a hit on
an INTERPOL Red Notice

29:19.493 --> 29:21.066
for a Nicaraguan national,

29:21.152 --> 29:22.769
Teresa Estrada.

29:22.855 --> 29:24.130
STEVE:
What's she wanted for?

29:24.216 --> 29:25.597
Terrorism.

30:09.003 --> 30:10.739
JERRY:
I did it. I'm in.

30:11.053 --> 30:14.341
My son was 19.

30:14.427 --> 30:16.342
Esteban never hurt anyone.

30:16.490 --> 30:17.995
He only spoke out

30:18.120 --> 30:20.403
when he saw others being hurt.

30:21.254 --> 30:24.708
And for that... one night,

30:25.880 --> 30:28.755
he disappeared
from his dormitory...

30:29.700 --> 30:32.146
stolen in the night

30:32.427 --> 30:33.958
by these government men.

30:34.161 --> 30:38.122
A month later, his body
was found in a well.

30:38.724 --> 30:40.038
(crying): They...

30:40.872 --> 30:42.498
They...

30:43.505 --> 30:45.239
They butchered him.

30:45.583 --> 30:48.128
Laptop has hours
of footage like this.

30:48.213 --> 30:49.628
Looks like it's from
a documentary

30:49.713 --> 30:51.416
that Brikz was making.

30:51.893 --> 30:53.978
He wanted the world
to hear Teresa's story

30:54.064 --> 30:55.243
so that she could
set the record straight.

30:55.328 --> 30:56.463
About what?

30:56.549 --> 30:58.002
Teresa Estrada is no terrorist,

30:58.088 --> 30:59.588
she's a dissident artist.

30:59.760 --> 31:01.572
She makes street art
in her native Nicaragua

31:01.658 --> 31:03.213
that protests
government corruption.

31:03.299 --> 31:05.736
To protect her identity,
she goes by the name of Fenix.

31:05.861 --> 31:07.627
After Esteban was murdered,

31:07.805 --> 31:11.400
I knew I had to carry on
his fight,

31:11.595 --> 31:13.744
calling out the monsters

31:14.109 --> 31:16.564
who oppress and slaughter
their own people.

31:16.978 --> 31:18.393
Powerful stuff.

31:18.559 --> 31:20.947
JERRY: Yeah. She made some
powerful enemies, too,

31:21.033 --> 31:22.525
including this guy,

31:22.759 --> 31:24.119
Arturo Granera.

31:24.205 --> 31:26.486
He's a top official in
Nicaragua's Directorate

31:26.572 --> 31:28.033
of Intelligence Affairs.

31:28.118 --> 31:29.603
According
to State Department intel,

31:29.689 --> 31:31.946
Granera's ruthless
and highly ambitious.

31:32.032 --> 31:33.947
Has his eye set
on the presidency.

31:34.033 --> 31:36.533
Anyone who gets in his way
tends to go missing.

31:36.619 --> 31:39.799
Geez. First Teresa's
son, now Teresa.

31:39.885 --> 31:42.260
It's like pissing this guy
off runs in the family.

31:42.346 --> 31:45.342
Granera must have known it was
her behind the protest pieces.

31:45.428 --> 31:47.517
Right? He sends a team out here
to track her down.

31:47.603 --> 31:49.228
Wait.
We ran James Cooper's

31:49.314 --> 31:52.377
travel records back before
we knew he was "Brikz."

31:52.579 --> 31:53.642
There. Look.

31:53.728 --> 31:55.683
He was in Costa Rica
a couple of months ago.

31:55.769 --> 31:57.181
Nicaragua's right next door.

31:57.267 --> 31:59.065
Guy with money like that,
it wouldn't be hard

31:59.151 --> 32:00.320
to get Teresa's papers

32:00.406 --> 32:02.125
and then smuggle her back
into the States.

32:02.211 --> 32:03.336
HIRSCH:
Looks like Brikz knew

32:03.422 --> 32:05.482
he was at the end of the road,
so decided

32:05.568 --> 32:06.798
to make a difference
on the way out.

32:06.883 --> 32:08.134
Okay.
Here's one thing I don't get:

32:08.219 --> 32:09.898
So Teresa is an enemy
of the state,

32:09.988 --> 32:12.743
so why not just take her out on
the roof and be done with it?

32:12.829 --> 32:14.993
'Cause Granera wants
to bring her in alive.

32:15.078 --> 32:16.453
STEVE: I agree
with Junior.

32:16.538 --> 32:18.196
I mean, for somebody like her,

32:18.282 --> 32:21.912
somebody who's... who's
embarrassed Granera personally,

32:21.998 --> 32:24.571
the best thing he can do
is discredit and diminish.

32:24.657 --> 32:28.086
Show trial.
Long, slow death in a dark cell.

32:28.172 --> 32:29.336
JUNIOR:
Which also means that

32:29.422 --> 32:31.711
even though the strike team
did get there before us,

32:31.797 --> 32:33.222
we still have a chance
to intercept

32:33.308 --> 32:34.610
before they take her off Oahu.

32:34.696 --> 32:36.860
Unless they already have.

32:36.946 --> 32:39.441
- We got to find that strike team.
- Okay, how?

32:39.527 --> 32:42.688
Joe White. Joe White had
a friend in the Agency

32:42.774 --> 32:44.078
in Nicaragua.

32:44.282 --> 32:45.898
I'm gonna make a call.

32:50.948 --> 32:52.938
<i>♪ Woo-hoo, woo-hoo-hoo ♪</i>

32:53.133 --> 32:54.946

32:55.032 --> 32:56.742

(pounding on door)

33:10.071 --> 33:11.512
(lock clicks)

33:11.598 --> 33:12.891
Hiya, pal.

33:12.977 --> 33:15.058
Gentlemen, excuse me...

33:16.287 --> 33:18.486
Game's closed
unless you have an invitation.

33:18.572 --> 33:20.891
Yeah? Well, mine's engraved.

33:22.858 --> 33:24.891
Time to cash
out, boys.

33:25.938 --> 33:27.586
Recognize this guy?

33:27.803 --> 33:28.874
I know if we

33:28.960 --> 33:30.045
shut this game down,

33:30.141 --> 33:31.805
you'll just pop up in a few days

33:31.891 --> 33:32.742
at another location,

33:32.828 --> 33:34.744
but that's a major pain
in the ass,

33:34.830 --> 33:36.460
not to mention
the lost revenue.

33:36.546 --> 33:38.140
So why don't you
do yourself

33:38.226 --> 33:39.742
and the both of
us a favor here

33:39.828 --> 33:40.993
and answer the question?

33:41.079 --> 33:42.336
Yeah, I know him.

33:42.452 --> 33:43.609
Or knew him, I should say.

33:43.695 --> 33:45.030
His name's Earl Whitaker.

33:45.476 --> 33:46.929
Won big last night, too.

33:47.047 --> 33:48.625
Cashed out early, around 2:00,

33:48.718 --> 33:50.125
- maybe 3:00.
- You notice

33:50.211 --> 33:51.618
if anybody followed
him when he left?

33:51.703 --> 33:52.773
No.

33:52.880 --> 33:55.297
Next person to leave wasn't
for another hour or so.

33:55.484 --> 33:58.195
See, Earl was strangled...
which leads us to believe

33:58.308 --> 34:00.643
that this was something
of a more personal nature.

34:00.728 --> 34:03.304
We're gonna need to find out
some more about his life.

34:03.390 --> 34:04.845
How much time you two got?

34:04.939 --> 34:07.564
Just... skip to the juicy parts.

34:07.664 --> 34:10.623
Okay. Well, let's see,
for starters, he cheated

34:10.710 --> 34:12.445
on his taxes...
I know that for a fact.

34:12.531 --> 34:14.484
And Whitaker,
this guy would always brag

34:14.570 --> 34:16.889
about how he wouldn't declare
a dime of his winnings.

34:16.976 --> 34:18.750
Oh, and speaking of cheating,

34:18.835 --> 34:20.717
he wasn't always the
most faithful guy

34:20.804 --> 34:22.764
to his ex-wife
and his girlfriend.

34:24.195 --> 34:26.092
Yo, Jerry, you get that link?

34:26.179 --> 34:28.054
- Calling it up now, Commander.
- We need it now.

34:28.139 --> 34:29.641
Please tell me
Joe's spy friend got a hit.

34:29.726 --> 34:31.617
He did.
The CIA just intercepted

34:31.703 --> 34:34.679
a live video signal
transmitting from Oahu

34:34.764 --> 34:36.867
to the Directorate
of Intelligence offices

34:36.953 --> 34:38.568
in Managua.

34:38.654 --> 34:40.029
HIRSCH: This is
happening now?

34:40.279 --> 34:42.569
(speaking Spanish)
STEVE:Yeah.

34:44.820 --> 34:47.313
Remote interrogation.
Guaranteed Granera

34:47.398 --> 34:48.860
and his goons are
on the other side of this.

34:48.945 --> 34:50.201
So I'm guessing
they decided against

34:50.286 --> 34:51.491
taking her back to Nicaragua.

34:51.628 --> 34:53.609
Yeah, they must know
that every cop on this island

34:53.695 --> 34:56.156
is after Teresa,
so the safer play is to get

34:56.242 --> 34:57.937
- the confession now.
- Yeah.

34:58.085 --> 34:59.953
And once they do,
they're gonna kill her.

35:04.242 --> 35:06.242
<i>Speaking Spanish...</i>

35:10.197 --> 35:11.721
She's saying she's guilty

35:11.807 --> 35:13.222
of crimes
against the state...

35:13.334 --> 35:14.869
This is obviously coerced.

35:14.955 --> 35:16.948
I'm guessing they have
some kind of leverage.

35:17.095 --> 35:19.377
Other than all the guns
pointed at her head?

35:19.463 --> 35:22.823
Yeah, I'm talking
about loved ones and relatives

35:22.909 --> 35:24.784
that are in danger.
I mean, you saw the way

35:24.903 --> 35:26.338
that she speaks
about her son.

35:26.441 --> 35:27.580
Everything this
woman does

35:27.666 --> 35:29.121
(phone chimes)
is for her family.

35:30.010 --> 35:33.056
I just sent you the contact
to Joe's man in Nicaragua.

35:33.142 --> 35:34.620
I want you to give him a call,
have him look

35:34.705 --> 35:36.291
into her family
in-country, please.

35:36.377 --> 35:37.422
Copy.

35:37.508 --> 35:38.878
Jerry, where are we at
tracing the signal.

35:38.963 --> 35:40.430
- Please. Come on.
- Well, it's being route?

35:40.515 --> 35:41.885
Through an anonymizer.
I mean,

35:41.971 --> 35:43.511
we can get there...
It's just gonna take time.

35:43.596 --> 35:44.970
I mean, time,
we don't have time.

35:45.056 --> 35:46.447
There's thousands
of high-end homes

35:46.533 --> 35:48.174
on this island...
they could be in any one of 'em.

35:48.259 --> 35:50.251
Hold on.
Look at that.

35:50.337 --> 35:53.142
That looks like
a painting.

35:53.504 --> 35:55.720
Think you can pull
another rabbit out of your hat?

35:55.982 --> 35:57.567
I can try.

35:57.808 --> 35:59.095
It's a little tough
to make out

35:59.181 --> 36:00.697
from this angle, but...

36:00.869 --> 36:02.517
it bears a striking
resemblance

36:02.670 --> 36:04.717
to... Synesthesia,

36:04.803 --> 36:07.350
by prominent local artist
Mahealani Chang.

36:07.436 --> 36:08.932
Jerry, can you help him
find out who bought this?

36:09.017 --> 36:10.272
We got to get
an address.

36:10.358 --> 36:12.506
How does a Nicaraguan
strike team

36:12.592 --> 36:15.217
end up in the home
of an art collector on Oahu?

36:15.303 --> 36:17.896
You said you only found one sleeping
bag in that warehouse, right?

36:17.982 --> 36:19.438
It's possible Teresa
was staying somewhere else.

36:19.524 --> 36:21.320
Yeah, I mean, Brikz has
connections to the art world.

36:21.436 --> 36:23.311
Maybe he put her up with
a patron of the arts,

36:23.397 --> 36:24.900
someone who sympathizes
with her cause.

36:24.985 --> 36:26.748
Got it. Found the buyer.

36:26.834 --> 36:28.896
JERRY: They live at Akulikuli
Terrace over in Black Point.

36:28.982 --> 36:30.131
All right, Tani, with me.

36:30.217 --> 36:31.990
Jerry, drop a pin,
send it to our phones.

36:32.076 --> 36:34.076
(engine roaring)

36:39.150 --> 36:41.150
<i>Teresa Speaking Spanish...</i>

36:47.312 --> 36:49.312
(continues in Spanish)

36:50.465 --> 36:51.747
- <i>¿Qué pasó?</i>
- STEVE: Five-O!

36:51.833 --> 36:53.433
Everybody down!
On the ground, right now!

36:53.861 --> 36:56.080
(shouting in Spanish)

36:56.166 --> 36:58.486
Come with me. Come on. Come on.
Everything's gonna be okay.

37:01.564 --> 37:02.769
STEVE:
Five-O.

37:03.042 --> 37:04.613
Case dismissed.

37:19.381 --> 37:21.418
Victoria Whitaker?
Five-O.

37:21.536 --> 37:22.661
What's up?

37:22.973 --> 37:24.518
What do you want?

37:24.627 --> 37:26.473
Cops already told me
Earl was killed.

37:26.559 --> 37:28.894
Yeah, but we figured we'd
stop by, see if you can help

37:28.990 --> 37:30.512
clear some
things up for us.

37:30.707 --> 37:32.842
You see, we pulled
your phone records.

37:32.946 --> 37:34.949
You received a text last night

37:35.035 --> 37:37.348
right around your
ex-husband's time of death.

37:37.434 --> 37:39.519
A text that happens
to have been sent

37:39.613 --> 37:41.832
by the dealer of the game
he was playing in.

37:41.918 --> 37:45.098
He told us that you bribed him
into contacting you

37:45.184 --> 37:46.949
should Earl start
winning big.

37:47.243 --> 37:49.269
Before you accuse me
of something, you should know

37:49.361 --> 37:51.777
- I was home last night.
- We know.

37:51.948 --> 37:54.332
That's why we'd like to talk
to your boyfriend.

37:54.418 --> 37:55.953
Do you know where he is?

37:56.039 --> 37:58.044
No. I mean...

37:58.130 --> 38:00.832
I-I haven't even seen him
in, like, a week.

38:04.869 --> 38:05.909
Hey!

38:10.910 --> 38:12.785
Admire the effort.

38:12.871 --> 38:15.882
The execution...
not so much.

38:27.951 --> 38:29.489
So...

38:29.575 --> 38:32.280
Teresa is being granted asylum.

38:32.708 --> 38:35.673
Yeah. And thanks to
McGarrett's CIA friend,

38:35.921 --> 38:38.286
so is the grandmother that
she left in Nicaragua.

38:38.372 --> 38:39.529
Her abuela?

38:39.615 --> 38:40.740
- Yeah.
- That is great.

38:40.826 --> 38:42.241
Mm-hmm.

38:42.347 --> 38:44.169
I love that word, abuela.

38:44.255 --> 38:45.670
- It's a great word.
- Mm.

38:45.782 --> 38:48.200
So, why did you invite me here?

38:48.286 --> 38:50.888
You-you made it very clear
that it's not a date.

38:52.597 --> 38:54.177
This is for you.

38:57.114 --> 38:59.216
George Davis?
Who's that?

38:59.332 --> 39:03.052
He is the lawyer that's
handling Brikz's estate.

39:03.724 --> 39:05.747
Apparently, he set aside
a huge chunk of money

39:05.833 --> 39:07.998
to start a foundation
for dissident artists,

39:08.084 --> 39:09.497
and they need
someone to run it,

39:09.583 --> 39:11.838
and I put out your name.

39:12.073 --> 39:14.357
Tani, I-I don't know
what to say.

39:14.717 --> 39:16.646
- Wh-Why me?
- You mentioned that

39:16.732 --> 39:18.935
your only skill was
copying other artists.

39:19.021 --> 39:21.521
I don't know if that's true,
but if it is,

39:21.607 --> 39:23.279
then why don't you
do it one last time?

39:23.365 --> 39:26.943
Why don't you... copy Brikz and
pick up where he left off?

39:28.398 --> 39:30.504
I know that you
can do this.

39:30.597 --> 39:32.583
And I know you'll
be good at it.

39:33.252 --> 39:34.575
'Cause you're talented.

39:34.661 --> 39:36.825
Wait, are you sure
this isn't a date?

39:37.607 --> 39:39.310
I mean, I'm gonna
take that back.

39:39.396 --> 39:41.401
Yeah. Never mind.
Never mind.

39:41.935 --> 39:44.029
(laughs)
Thank you.

39:44.159 --> 39:46.208
You're welcome.
Cheers.

39:46.294 --> 39:47.476
Thank you.

39:47.787 --> 39:49.575
HIRSCH:
So, if this isn't a date,

39:49.661 --> 39:51.193
can we plan one for tomorrow?

39:51.279 --> 39:53.310
TANI:  Hirsch, please don't
ruin this beautiful moment.

39:56.412 --> 39:58.286

39:58.372 --> 40:00.172
<i>♪ Where the flower smells... ♪</i>

(Maya's faint,
distorted giggling)

40:15.529 --> 40:18.489
NATANO (distorted): Maya,
I have a surprise for you.

40:28.863 --> 40:30.630
Daddy, I love it!

40:32.826 --> 40:34.989
I love you so much, Daddy.

40:39.502 --> 40:41.193
(sighs)

40:50.029 --> 40:51.568
Dad?

41:10.152 --> 41:12.169
Let's get you to bed.

41:46.690 --> 41:48.580
I got you, Dad.

42:39.230 --> 42:40.620
It's okay, Dad.

42:40.706 --> 42:43.328
