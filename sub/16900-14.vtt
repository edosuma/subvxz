Come on in, Tracy.

00:05.881 --> 00:07.716
Yo, is this about that little
red-headed intern?

00:07.883 --> 00:09.218
'Cause she asked me to take it out.

00:09.384 --> 00:10.385
No, no, no.

00:10.594 --> 00:11.887
I wanted to invite you to join me

00:12.095 --> 00:14.681
at a charity golf tourney
that Don Geiss is hosting

00:14.890 --> 00:16.308
at his country club in Old Saybrook.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.186
I'm not familiar with about
half the words in that sentence.

00:19.396 --> 00:24.690
How 'bout you come with me to a big party
in Connecticut, and meet Don Geiss?

00:24.904 --> 00:26.810
Is that the gay guy from Project Runway?

00:26.984 --> 00:27.695
 No.

00:27.902 --> 00:29.984
He's the CEO of this corporation.

00:30.199 --> 00:30.783
The big man.

00:30.987 --> 00:31.902
The dude from my checks?

00:32.116 --> 00:33.990
The dude from your checks.

00:34.208 --> 00:35.610
And a good person for you to know.

00:35.785 --> 00:36.623
A'ight, sure.

00:36.786 --> 00:38.490
Thanks for inviting me.

00:38.705 --> 00:39.411
 Okay false alarm.

00:39.587 --> 00:43.581
It turns out she asked him to take it out.

00:43.798 --> 00:45.290
Oh, hey.

00:45.506 --> 00:49.213
I'll see you in CT, Jackie D.

00:49.385 --> 00:50.092
What's that about?

00:50.306 --> 00:53.302
I've invited him to join me at
a GE charity golf tournament in Connecticut.

00:53.518 --> 00:55.182
Was Courtney Love not available?

00:55.385 --> 00:58.013
Liz, all the VPs will be angling
to golf with Don Geiss,

00:58.187 --> 01:01.012
but my partner will be Tracy Jordan,
his grandchildren's favorite movie star.

01:01.185 --> 01:03.103
Geiss will absolutely choose us,
and that's a big deal

01:03.317 --> 01:06.902
because being in a foursome
with this man can change your life.

01:07.106 --> 01:08.483
You might want to rephrase that.

01:08.697 --> 01:10.482
Golf with Geiss means four hours of face time

01:10.695 --> 01:12.400
with a man you normally
only get 20 minutes with.

01:12.617 --> 01:14.192
Which one is Geiss again, the bald one?

01:14.407 --> 01:15.901
No.

01:16.118 --> 01:17.490
That one.

01:17.708 --> 01:19.281
Where did that come from?

01:19.496 --> 01:20.990
I painted it myself.

01:21.207 --> 01:23.912
Wow, that's really good.

01:24.086 --> 01:25.002
You want one?

01:25.216 --> 01:27.000
Consider it done.

01:27.217 --> 01:29.590
Thanks.

01:32.007 --> 01:34.882
Simply the best

Has anybody seen Condoleeza
on Meet the Press yesterday?

01:58.286 --> 02:00.202
She always sounds so terrified.

02:00.417 --> 02:01.202
She's always, like,

02:01.416 --> 02:03.290
The President has a plan for Iran,

02:03.496 --> 02:08.002
and we are currently adhering to that plan.

02:08.216 --> 02:09.291
Hey, Frank, wake up.

02:09.508 --> 02:11.083
You're not allowed to sleep
through the topical meeting.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.212
Dude, I'm exhausted.

02:12.387 --> 02:15.212
I stayed up all night watching
a Designing Women marathon.

02:15.387 --> 02:15.881
Oh, my God.

02:16.098 --> 02:16.721
Oh, yeah, me too.

02:16.886 --> 02:18.012
At first, I hated it.

02:18.188 --> 02:19.090
And then I liked it.

02:19.308 --> 02:21.011
And then I hated it again.

02:21.186 --> 02:23.600
And then I got horny,
and then I fell asleep.

02:23.817 --> 02:27.390
Well, focus up, we have
a lot of work to do.

02:27.605 --> 02:28.892
Lutz, not while we're working!

02:29.106 --> 02:30.982
Ay, pero ay Dios mio!

02:31.195 --> 02:32.692
Oh, I'm sorry Theresa.

02:32.907 --> 02:35.480
I'm sorry.

02:35.987 --> 02:38.782
Okay, maybe something about
the mid-term elections?

02:38.998 --> 02:41.492
Hey, what about my Dancing
with the Hobo sketch?

02:41.706 --> 02:44.913
I didn't like it two weeks ago
when it was called America's Next Top Hobo,

02:45.085 --> 02:48.713
and I didn't like it a month ago,
when it was called Hobo Eye for the Straight Guy.

02:48.917 --> 02:50.082
Deal or No Hobo?

02:50.296 --> 02:52.793
Hey, Lutz, why don't you approach your job
with the same creativity

02:53.008 --> 02:55.091
and excitement you have for
all-you-can-eat buffets?

02:55.308 --> 02:57.800
Ooh. Ooh.

02:59.098 --> 03:01.510
Okay, the van to take you up
to Connecticut will be leaving at noon.

03:01.686 --> 03:04.603
And once you get up to the golf course,
you'll be working in pairs.

03:04.815 --> 03:10.101
So, Tim and Shyla, Amy and Becca,
Kenneth and Grace, and Eric and Pat.

03:10.318 --> 03:13.111
Okay, have fun.
Don't get drunk.

03:13.316 --> 03:14.402
Buddy up.

03:14.616 --> 03:15.403
Mr. Hornberger.

03:15.618 --> 03:16.403
Yeah?

03:16.618 --> 03:17.990
Grace and I cannot work together.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.191
Why not?

03:19.407 --> 03:23.283
We have a past.
A romantic past.

03:23.628 --> 03:28.200
Well, Grace, it's been
a pleasure talking to you.

03:28.417 --> 03:29.710
Grace Park!

03:29.916 --> 03:31.582
You know this can't happen.

03:31.797 --> 03:34.082
We're pages.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.382
I just don't want to
disgrace the peacock.

03:36.596 --> 03:40.883
Oh, Kenneth, if you're worried about disgracing
the National Broadcasting Company,

03:41.096 --> 03:44.092
you're too late.

04:00.615 --> 04:03.991
Look, Grace, this is obviously
incredibly awkward for both of us,

04:04.208 --> 04:07.080
but let's just try to be professional.

04:07.288 --> 04:09.580
Your peacock earrings look nice.

04:09.795 --> 04:11.582
Doggone it, Grace,

04:11.798 --> 04:14.881
I just don't know myself around you.

04:15.087 --> 04:15.883
Hello, gentlemen.

04:16.086 --> 04:18.591
Welcome to the ninth annual
Cure Diabetes Now golf tournament.

04:18.805 --> 04:19.882
Has Don Geiss arrived yet?

04:20.095 --> 04:22.302
No, sir, but if you'd like,
we could work out a signal,

04:22.515 --> 04:23.800
so I could let you know
when he does arrive.

04:24.017 --> 04:26.093
Like--

04:26.306 --> 04:27.181
That won't be necessary.

04:27.397 --> 04:30.810
I'll probably just do it anyway.

04:31.028 --> 04:32.892
That cold open you guys wrote last night
came out really good.

04:33.108 --> 04:34.103
Oh, thanks.

04:34.318 --> 04:35.402
It was like pulling teeth.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.193
They're so lazy sometimes.

04:37.407 --> 04:38.193
Especially Lutz.

04:38.407 --> 04:39.982
Well, good job whipping 'em into shape.

04:40.197 --> 04:41.401
That thing is really smart.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.401
Now, when Dennis Hastert farts,
should that be live, or pre-recorded?

04:43.618 --> 04:43.903
Live.

04:44.118 --> 04:45.280
It has to be live for the timing.

04:45.498 --> 04:48.413
I thought so too.

04:48.587 --> 04:49.993
Look at these guys.

04:50.205 --> 04:51.290
Yeah.

04:51.505 --> 04:52.792
They like you.

04:53.006 --> 04:55.580
They're very good at sensing
debilitating loneliness in a person.

04:55.798 --> 04:57.381
Maybe you ought to adopt one.

04:57.587 --> 04:58.293
Oh, I can't.

04:58.507 --> 05:00.593
I'm allergic to anything
warm and adorable.

05:00.806 --> 05:02.013
I'm sick of it.

05:02.217 --> 05:05.590
I'm doing my job, and she just shoots me down
in front of everybody.

05:05.807 --> 05:08.801
I don't care if she's the boss,
Liz is a grade-A--

05:09.015 --> 05:09.890
Runt!

05:10.108 --> 05:11.012
What?

05:11.186 --> 05:13.481
This kitten, he's such a runt!

05:13.687 --> 05:15.600
I'm gonna name you Runty.

05:15.818 --> 05:18.690
You're such a little raging little runt!

05:18.907 --> 05:19.691
Come on, Runty.

05:19.906 --> 05:22.401
Come on.

05:24.117 --> 05:25.110
Jack, how are you?

05:25.287 --> 05:26.780
Ted, Amanda, so nice to see you.

05:26.997 --> 05:27.613
Hello.

05:27.787 --> 05:28.912
This is Tracy Jordan.

05:29.126 --> 05:31.492
Ted here is the head of our
commercial aviation division.

05:31.707 --> 05:33.291
You need to hook me up
with one of them helicopters.

05:33.506 --> 05:34.082
Absolutely.

05:34.297 --> 05:35.713
I'd be happy to arrange
for you to take a ride.

05:35.917 --> 05:37.290
No, I don't want to get in it.

05:37.507 --> 05:42.880
I want to blow it up and run away
from it in slow motion.

05:43.095 --> 05:44.381
Pleasure to have met you.

05:44.597 --> 05:45.510
Damn straight.

05:45.725 --> 05:47.892
I'm delightful.

05:48.108 --> 05:50.600
You're doing great.
Everybody loves you.

05:50.804 --> 05:54.890
On season five, when Delta
was really packin' it on---

05:55.104 --> 05:55.985
Glorious.

05:56.192 --> 05:57.394
We need to fire Lutz.

05:57.609 --> 05:58.312
Why, what happened?

05:58.486 --> 06:00.611
He called me the worst name ever.

06:00.815 --> 06:01.693
What did he call you?

06:01.905 --> 06:03.482
I'm not gonna repeat it.
That's how much I hate it.

06:03.697 --> 06:04.113
Fat can?

06:04.286 --> 06:04.613
No.

06:04.787 --> 06:05.192
Mouth hooker?

06:05.406 --> 06:05.693
No.

06:05.907 --> 06:06.200
Monster bitch.

06:06.406 --> 06:06.783
Hatchet face.

06:06.997 --> 06:08.201
No!

06:08.415 --> 06:11.911
The one the rhymes with the name
of your favorite Todd Rundgren album.

06:12.085 --> 06:14.492
It rhymes with Hermit of Mink Hollow?

06:14.707 --> 06:16.081
No!

06:16.298 --> 06:17.003
Oh.

06:17.218 --> 06:17.921
Oh boy.

06:18.087 --> 06:20.503
Well, you know, he was probably
just blowing off steam.

06:20.717 --> 06:21.790
You can't fire a guy for cursing.

06:22.005 --> 06:25.591
I'm not upset about cursing.
I mean, I love cursing.

06:25.808 --> 06:26.590
I love it.

06:26.806 --> 06:31.181
But this word is not acceptable
because there's nothing
you can call a guy back.

06:31.396 --> 06:33.600
There is no male equivalent to this word.

06:33.817 --> 06:36.482
Well, why don't we come up with one
and then you can call him that?

06:36.685 --> 06:38.893
Like...monkus.

06:39.105 --> 06:39.980
Fungdark.

06:40.196 --> 06:41.902
No, I'm serious, you guys.

06:42.117 --> 06:43.110
You're just in reaction right now.

06:43.326 --> 06:45.280
You need to just take
a few hours and calm down.

06:45.486 --> 06:47.693
Don't tell me to calm down you fungdark.

06:47.907 --> 06:48.201
Yeah, you're right.

06:48.405 --> 06:49.782
It doesn't work.

06:49.996 --> 06:52.123
I don't know, I think
Liz is right about this.

06:52.287 --> 06:55.411
Lutz has been totally slacking off
since his grandma died.

06:55.587 --> 06:56.203
What?

06:56.418 --> 06:57.413
Why didn't you guys tell me?

06:57.587 --> 06:59.583
I thought you knew
and you were just being a...

06:59.796 --> 07:02.381
You know, that word Lutz called you.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.713
Wait, are you saying that
I am like that sometimes?

07:04.887 --> 07:05.501
Um...

07:05.717 --> 07:06.302
Um...

07:06.517 --> 07:09.513
And they thought my sister
couldn't even have a baby,
so she's really excited.

07:09.686 --> 07:11.802
Oh, he's adorable.

07:12.015 --> 07:16.311
Okay, we're at the bottom of page two.

07:18.108 --> 07:24.822
Hey, look everybody Sherlock Homo is here
to solve the case of the gay sweater.

07:29.998 --> 07:30.782
I'm telling you guys...

07:30.998 --> 07:36.410
watching that isn't gonna
get us out of here any faster.

07:36.995 --> 07:39.083
Oh, my God, I am.

07:39.298 --> 07:40.082
I'm a total...

07:40.298 --> 07:41.210
Runt!

07:41.428 --> 07:43.002
Runt!

07:43.215 --> 07:44.500
I lost my kitten.

07:44.718 --> 07:46.091
Has anyone seen my runt?

07:46.308 --> 07:47.303
Runt!

07:47.505 --> 07:49.093
Runt!

07:49.306 --> 07:51.590
Bringing Tracy Jordan was a smart move, Jack.

07:51.805 --> 07:52.680
He's the hit of the party.

07:52.898 --> 07:54.300
You got that right, my friend.

07:54.517 --> 07:57.812
Tomorrow I'm gonna be in an intense
six hour foursome with three other men.

07:58.025 --> 08:01.102
And one of them will be Don Geiss
and he's gonna get all of my attention.

08:01.318 --> 08:05.810
And you're just gonna sit back and watch.

08:10.197 --> 08:10.992
Would you excuse me?

08:11.207 --> 08:12.700
You know the army's been messing with the sun.

08:12.915 --> 08:14.493
That's why I keep my junk covered.

08:14.708 --> 08:16.700
Once that stuff get in your hang,
you're done.

08:16.915 --> 08:18.410
Would you excuse us for a moment, please?

08:18.587 --> 08:19.203
What's going on?

08:19.418 --> 08:20.913
It's game time.

08:21.088 --> 08:22.713
Jack, you handsome son of a gun!

08:22.927 --> 08:24.791
This guy gets younger every time I see him!

08:25.008 --> 08:26.000
No, you're the one.

08:26.215 --> 08:27.502
Oh, hair like a Viking.

08:27.718 --> 08:28.711
God bless you.

08:28.887 --> 08:30.880
Don, I want you to meet
my friend Tracy Jordan.

08:31.095 --> 08:32.380
Tracy Jordan.

08:32.597 --> 08:33.683
This is exciting.

08:33.886 --> 08:36.513
My grandchildren just love your movies.

08:36.687 --> 08:40.023
Thank you so much for being here
and supporting diabetes research.

08:40.184 --> 08:41.101
Hey, I feel you.

08:41.315 --> 08:43.893
Messed up sugar runs in my family too.

08:44.107 --> 08:46.690
So, how's your short game?

08:46.907 --> 08:47.810
You'll find out tomorrow.

08:47.986 --> 08:52.402
This guys spends so much time in the sand
that his nickname should be Falu-ser.

08:52.617 --> 08:54.283
That's humorous.

08:54.498 --> 08:56.622
Hey, how come you don't hire
more black people around here?

08:56.786 --> 08:57.782
Beg your pardon?

08:57.998 --> 08:59.792
How come there's no black people here?

08:59.997 --> 09:01.792
Black people can't make light bulbs?

09:02.006 --> 09:05.922
No, actually we have
an award winning diversity program.

09:06.087 --> 09:09.710
How come there's just me
and Carlton over there?

09:09.887 --> 09:13.380
I believe Tracy's referring to Carlton,
the straight laced brother

09:13.597 --> 09:18.180
from Fresh Prince of Bel Air,
1990 through 1996. On NBC.

09:18.398 --> 09:21.012
Are we having fun or what?

09:21.186 --> 09:23.982
My associate's name is Francis Callier.

09:24.187 --> 09:25.983
And he's a lawyer.

09:26.195 --> 09:28.812
Excuse me.

09:39.418 --> 09:43.413
So what time does this
golf thing kick off tomorrow?

09:43.588 --> 09:44.582
It doesn't matter now, Tracy.

09:44.796 --> 09:46.921
We're not in Geiss' foursome,
thanks to you.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.213
What?

09:48.385 --> 09:49.380
I can't help it if he got mad.

09:49.598 --> 09:50.383
You know me.

09:50.598 --> 09:52.002
I'm gonna say what's on my mind, Jack.

09:52.307 --> 09:53.301
No, not in here you don't.

09:53.518 --> 09:57.092
I wanted you to entertain these people,
not publicly humiliate them.

09:57.308 --> 10:00.300
I'm supposed to just be a funny black man
who says funny things.

10:00.517 --> 10:03.180
No, I wanted you to discuss your
astounding medical breakthroughs.

10:03.396 --> 10:03.813
Okay.

10:04.025 --> 10:07.692
Bartender, could you bring me a Mustang Melon
and a bag of barbeque potato chips?

10:07.905 --> 10:10.483
'Cause apparently I'm only here
to be a stereotype.

10:10.698 --> 10:11.401
Would you keep your voice down, please?

10:11.616 --> 10:12.403
You're embarrassing yourself.

10:12.615 --> 10:14.991
No, I'm not embarrassing myself,
I'm embarrassing you.

10:15.196 --> 10:19.992
And guess what, Jack?
I'm just getting started.

10:22.285 --> 10:26.583
Son, I wasn't joking
about those chips.

10:27.086 --> 10:27.790
Hey hey hey.

10:28.007 --> 10:30.502
What do you wanna do about Lutz?
Should I call him into my office?

10:30.716 --> 10:32.091
I think we should wait on that.

10:32.295 --> 10:33.503
Really? Okay.

10:33.718 --> 10:34.383
Whatcha got?

10:34.598 --> 10:35.301
A-ha!

10:35.517 --> 10:37.221
I made something for the writers.

10:37.386 --> 10:38.592
Brisket!

10:38.806 --> 10:42.010
No, it's two dozen cupcakes
with melted mini-candy bars in the middle.

10:42.187 --> 10:42.511
Mmm.

10:42.685 --> 10:43.603
Oh, I get it.

10:43.815 --> 10:46.101
You're trying to be nice now
'cause of what Lutz said.

10:46.317 --> 10:47.890
No, I'm not trying to be nice.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.391
I am nice.

10:49.606 --> 10:52.902
I'm a nice person
you bald, gangly...

10:53.118 --> 10:57.993
I'm gonna try harder.
I'm gonna try and be nice.

11:04.495 --> 11:07.003
I sure hope Mr. Jack
plays his game good today.

11:07.206 --> 11:10.003
Otherwise he whups my ass
right well when we get home.

11:10.216 --> 11:11.712
Ain't that right, Mr. Jack?

11:11.887 --> 11:14.710
You know, Ted, Kenneth here is one of our
most promising young pages.

11:14.885 --> 11:16.883
He knows everything there is
to know about the business.

11:17.097 --> 11:20.012
I studied TV theory at
Kentucky Mountain Bible College.

11:20.185 --> 11:22.391
I studied fried chicken
at the school of hard knocks.

11:22.596 --> 11:23.802
Ain't that right, Mr. Jack?

11:24.016 --> 11:25.101
You still here?

11:25.316 --> 11:27.603
I'm ridiculous.
I'm black!

11:27.817 --> 11:29.481
I may even be ugly.

11:29.695 --> 11:31.980
But dear God...
I'm here!

11:32.196 --> 11:33.402
I'm here!

11:33.618 --> 11:38.113
And nothing but them
can keep me from it!

11:48.085 --> 11:48.790
Oh, I'm so sorry.

11:49.005 --> 11:49.501
I'm so sorry.

11:49.718 --> 11:50.500
I thought I turned it off.

11:50.717 --> 11:52.921
No, Cooper, take the call.
I mean, come on.

11:53.085 --> 11:58.010
This isn't Hitler's bunker.
That would make me Hitler.

11:58.218 --> 11:58.513
What?

11:58.716 --> 12:00.011
This is the new me.

12:00.226 --> 12:02.011
Do you like the new me?

12:02.185 --> 12:06.011
Before you answer, superballs!

12:06.606 --> 12:07.182
Awesome!

12:07.398 --> 12:11.310
What a fun boss you have, right?

12:11.988 --> 12:15.813
Would you like me to do a tap dance for you
and your big time friends, Mr. Jack?

12:15.986 --> 12:18.693
Or I could run around while
y'all are throwing rocks at me.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.611
Kenneth, play this hole for me, would you?

12:20.787 --> 12:23.610
Come with me.

12:25.627 --> 12:26.992
What are you doing?

12:27.206 --> 12:27.913
Payback.

12:28.086 --> 12:29.701
The way you treated me.
You used me.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.711
God, it's like dating
Katie Couric all over again.

12:31.916 --> 12:32.290
I didn't use you.

12:32.506 --> 12:35.580
I created a situation that could have been
mutually beneficial, and you blew it.

12:35.795 --> 12:38.883
If you can't handle Tracy Jordan,
don't invite Tracy Jordan.

12:39.097 --> 12:41.010
This is what I do.
I drop truth bombs.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.013
I don't care about Don Geiss!

12:43.226 --> 12:45.093
I'm a movie star!

12:45.308 --> 12:47.010
Oh, my.

12:47.186 --> 12:48.682
No, no.
You were a movie star.

12:48.896 --> 12:51.180
You haven't gotten a movie made
in over two years, and you know why?

12:51.395 --> 12:52.481
Because of your truth bombs.

12:52.685 --> 12:54.693
Remind me, Tracy, what did you tell
the president of Warner Brothers?

12:54.907 --> 12:55.692
Told him he could suck it.

12:55.905 --> 12:56.610
And the president of Paramount?

12:56.818 --> 12:58.400
Told her she could
kiss my delicious ass.

12:58.618 --> 13:01.781
And how's that working for you?
Yeah, I thought so.

13:01.998 --> 13:04.610
Hey, why don't you play the game with me?

13:04.788 --> 13:07.911
Like it or not, guys like Geiss
run everything, including movie studios.

13:08.125 --> 13:10.081
And we could be playing golf
with him right now instead of Ted,

13:10.295 --> 13:15.923
who's best known for getting caught using
a corporate credit card at a gay strip club.

13:16.107 --> 13:21.801
I'm sorry, Amanda, you were bound
to find that out eventually.

13:29.305 --> 13:30.600
Where is everybody?

13:30.815 --> 13:33.100
Oh, they all had personal problems
they had to take care of.

13:33.315 --> 13:34.101
Go, go.

13:34.318 --> 13:37.480
If I thought I left my coffeemaker on,
I wouldn't be able to focus either.

13:37.696 --> 13:38.813
No, no, I get it.

13:38.987 --> 13:41.782
Everyone should see
Mama Mia before it closes.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.993
What kind of sinus stuff?

13:44.198 --> 13:46.490
I'm just having some weird sinus stuff.

13:46.708 --> 13:49.491
Okay. Go home.

13:49.788 --> 13:53.791
Then I sent Lutz and Frank out to get us
some pizzas and they never came back.

13:54.006 --> 13:55.790
So you're finishing up everyone's
re-writes by yourself?

13:56.008 --> 13:56.713
That's not right.

13:56.925 --> 13:59.001
Yes, but at least I know
that nobody hates me today.

13:59.216 --> 14:03.301
You think Jack Donagee sits up there and worries
if people are saying bad things about him?

14:03.516 --> 14:04.381
It's different for women.

14:04.596 --> 14:05.381
I don't think it is.

14:05.596 --> 14:07.010
Sometimes people hate their bosses.

14:07.188 --> 14:07.892
Big deal.

14:08.096 --> 14:09.600
But you gotta stick up for yourself.

14:09.807 --> 14:15.020
Because if you don't...
they'll take advantage of you.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.391
Oh, hey, could I borrow 60 bucks?

14:17.606 --> 14:22.193
I'm going to meet Frank and Lutz at Scores.

14:24.786 --> 14:29.781
So I founded the Don Geiss
Diabetes Research Foundation

14:29.995 --> 14:33.081
which is why you're all here tonight.

14:33.297 --> 14:36.503
Gwen and I really hope you'll be
as generous with your checkbooks

14:36.715 --> 14:41.591
as you were on the links today
with your scorekeeping.

14:41.798 --> 14:44.382
Thank you.

14:47.885 --> 14:50.092
What's he doing?

14:50.307 --> 14:51.802
Excuse me!

14:52.015 --> 14:56.101
I know I wasn't asked to say anything,
but I would like to share my experience with you.

14:56.317 --> 14:57.390
When my daughter Shahita was born,

14:57.606 --> 15:00.692
she had chubby arms
and legs and a big bald head.

15:00.905 --> 15:05.193
She looked like
my Uncle Rupert in a diaper.

15:05.407 --> 15:07.612
By the time she was five,
she was 87 pounds.

15:07.785 --> 15:09.703
I mean, she could eat!

15:09.918 --> 15:11.702
But then, when was around
eight years old...

15:11.915 --> 15:13.200
I remember it was Easter.

15:13.415 --> 15:19.290
We stayed up all night the night before
watching bible movies and eating Fiddle Faddle.

15:19.508 --> 15:21.793
I remember the next day, Easter Sunday,

15:22.005 --> 15:26.592
she threw up right
in the middle of the Jaguar dealership.

15:26.806 --> 15:28.592
She was mad sick.

15:28.806 --> 15:32.801
And I carried her all the way
to St. Luke's Roosevelt.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.891
The doctor said she had diabetes.

15:36.107 --> 15:38.601
I get very upset because
I think I was the cause

15:38.817 --> 15:42.190
of that due to my ignorance of nutrition.

15:42.405 --> 15:44.310
And I promised Sha that night...

15:44.485 --> 15:50.112
that I was gonna dedicate
all my efforts to raise awareness...

15:50.286 --> 15:52.910
and finding a cure.

15:53.125 --> 15:55.782
And I just hope that
all of you will join me.

15:55.997 --> 15:58.582
Thank you.

16:06.388 --> 16:07.502
Unbelievable!

16:07.715 --> 16:09.380
Record donations.

16:09.596 --> 16:10.880
I can't thank you enough.

16:11.097 --> 16:14.683
Jack, I'm gonna be on
the Vineyard next month.

16:14.896 --> 16:17.013
I want you and Tracy to come up,
and we'll talk about

16:17.188 --> 16:19.020
getting you back in the movie business.

16:19.186 --> 16:20.102
I'll set that up, sir.

16:20.316 --> 16:21.391
Okay.

16:21.607 --> 16:23.101
Tracy, bring your daughter.

16:23.317 --> 16:24.193
That's a deal.

16:24.406 --> 16:25.900
Thanks again.

16:26.115 --> 16:27.113
Congratulations, Tracy.

16:27.327 --> 16:29.281
And welcome to the grown up world.

16:29.485 --> 16:30.692
Yeah.

16:30.905 --> 16:34.281
I don't have a daughter.

16:35.996 --> 16:40.293
Let's have a casting session on Monday.

16:49.807 --> 16:52.011
Grace...

16:52.225 --> 16:54.180
There is something
that I must say to you.

16:54.386 --> 16:56.600
But my words cannot suffice.

16:56.805 --> 16:59.681
So to quote Mr. Jerry McGuire....

16:59.896 --> 17:02.981
you make me a complete person.

17:03.196 --> 17:07.111
When you said hello,
you had me.

17:09.406 --> 17:11.902
My wife needs her sweater.

17:12.116 --> 17:12.402
Ow!

17:12.617 --> 17:15.112
Yes, sir!

17:16.494 --> 17:19.200
You're watching the Designing Women Marathon
on Nick at Nite.

17:19.415 --> 17:20.579
Sir, you may be right.

17:20.797 --> 17:23.583
I may be not capable of understanding
normal thinking

17:23.797 --> 17:26.582
because I think a woman is just
as powerful as a man.

17:26.797 --> 17:28.592
And until you learn to respect me,

17:28.798 --> 17:32.010
you better learn
to stay out of my way.

17:32.217 --> 17:35.593
'Cause this is my house.

17:37.517 --> 17:40.512
This is my house.

17:45.108 --> 17:48.903
Staying up all night re-writing
The Amazing Hobo.

17:49.115 --> 17:51.191
You fat nerd.

17:51.407 --> 17:52.280
Good morning, Lemon.

17:52.486 --> 17:54.190
Hey, Jack, come on!

17:54.406 --> 17:55.493
You stay up all night?

17:55.708 --> 17:58.703
How can you tell?

17:58.918 --> 18:00.783
This is the men's room.

18:00.995 --> 18:03.200
Oh!

18:05.505 --> 18:07.213
Did you win your golf parade?

18:07.428 --> 18:08.423
Even better.

18:08.588 --> 18:12.501
Next weekend Tracy and I are gonna
double team Don Geiss with our big ideas.

18:12.718 --> 18:13.803
You're so weird.

18:14.016 --> 18:16.722
Now get out of here.
I have to yell at my staff.

18:16.888 --> 18:22.392
Because I'm not just feminine,
I also can project my power.

18:25.988 --> 18:29.190
Didn't you bake us anything?

18:29.407 --> 18:31.821
Hey, I thought you were gonna
being snickerdoodles in.

18:31.988 --> 18:33.321
That's the only reason I showed up.

18:33.486 --> 18:36.783
I mean, you can't promise snickerdoodles
and then not bring any.

18:36.996 --> 18:39.622
That's not cool.

18:39.787 --> 18:41.202
Listen up, everybody.

18:41.416 --> 18:41.910
Listen to me.

18:42.088 --> 18:42.581
Listen!

18:42.787 --> 18:44.081
Shh shh shh shh shh.

18:44.297 --> 18:45.913
There will be no more baked goods.

18:46.087 --> 18:48.211
No more walking all over me.

18:48.428 --> 18:51.291
I was here all night doing your work.

18:51.507 --> 18:53.003
But at 3:30 this morning,

18:53.216 --> 18:56.722
I happened to see this episode
of Designing Women.

18:56.887 --> 19:00.181
And when it came on again at 5:30,
I taped it.

19:00.395 --> 19:02.601
And I want you all
to watch very closely.

19:02.808 --> 19:08.192
Because it sums up so perfectly
what I wanna say to you.

19:09.316 --> 19:10.812
What do I hit, input?

19:10.987 --> 19:12.480
Is there a TV/VCR button?

19:12.697 --> 19:13.983
What is aux?

19:14.196 --> 19:15.482
Hey, can I go now?

19:15.697 --> 19:16.190
Hang on.

19:16.405 --> 19:19.991
I want your full attention!

19:21.116 --> 19:24.082
Why is it making that noise?

19:24.285 --> 19:26.501
Ugh.

19:28.506 --> 19:29.792
Okay, never mind.

19:30.007 --> 19:34.000
But I want to say something to all of you.

19:34.216 --> 19:35.591
I am the boss here.

19:35.807 --> 19:38.383
And sometimes that's gonna
make me unpopular.

19:38.596 --> 19:40.511
But the point is...

19:40.688 --> 19:44.102
I know what you called me, Lutz.

19:44.306 --> 19:45.391
Oh.

19:45.608 --> 19:47.680
I'm sorry that I said that.

19:47.897 --> 19:49.890
Please don't make me
move back to Alaska, Liz.

19:50.107 --> 19:50.982
I hate it there.

19:51.195 --> 19:53.112
You can stay.

19:53.316 --> 19:54.693
But if you ever...

19:54.905 --> 19:58.690
If any of you ever call me
that horrible word again,

19:58.908 --> 20:00.202
I will fire you.

20:00.406 --> 20:03.413
And you will never alter drapes
in Atlanta again.

20:03.627 --> 20:08.003
Because you do not cross
a Sugarbaker woman!

20:08.206 --> 20:10.502
I'm so tired.

20:10.715 --> 20:14.080
I'm so tired, you guys.

20:20.306 --> 20:23.301
All right, champ.
