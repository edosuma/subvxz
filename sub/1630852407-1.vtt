[Q. WHAT DO YOU SEE
AS THE ROLE OF THE FIRST LADY?]

01:46.777 --> 01:48.106
The role of the first lady…

01:50.997 --> 01:55.093
So, presuming that my husband
Jung Jun-hyeok does become president,

01:56.429 --> 01:57.601
I'll answer it in that way, I guess.

02:04.848 --> 02:07.902
I think the role of First Lady demands

02:10.335 --> 02:13.243
that she help her husband
stay faithful to his principles.

02:14.776 --> 02:17.509
I've been interested in the ignored
and those discriminated against.

02:19.056 --> 02:19.930
All around us,

02:20.331 --> 02:24.607
so many kinds of discrimination
remain unresolved.

02:27.352 --> 02:28.215
But, you know,

02:30.573 --> 02:33.613
despite their continued suffering,

02:35.239 --> 02:37.111
the world just keeps on turning.

02:38.354 --> 02:39.542
It's a real shame.

02:51.398 --> 02:53.209
Really, quite a shame.

03:42.513 --> 03:43.593
Your assignments, then.

03:44.817 --> 03:47.201
In the Third Exhibit Hall
we have… Lim So-yeon?

03:47.310 --> 03:48.177
Yes.

03:48.521 --> 03:50.107
- Shin Su-rim?
- Here.

03:50.706 --> 03:52.025
- Kim Yi-seol?
- Yes.

03:53.280 --> 03:56.612
If you look at the floor plan,
your sections are all marked.

03:57.149 --> 03:59.177
Oh, there's one thing to be aware of.

03:59.277 --> 04:01.904
Items in the designated
exhibit spaces are fluid,

04:02.343 --> 04:05.450
so we request that all of you here

04:05.722 --> 04:07.522
read the distributed materials carefully.

04:08.022 --> 04:08.815
- Okay.
- Yes.

04:09.396 --> 04:10.728
Let's go to the next room.

04:16.914 --> 04:20.620
This is the usage rights permission form
that we received from the family.

04:21.083 --> 04:24.007
During the exhibition period,
insurance and transportation are covered.

04:24.220 --> 04:27.232
Lately people are really only
interested in monochrome,

04:27.799 --> 04:29.409
so I was rather worried,

04:30.289 --> 04:32.708
but look at what
a great exhibition you've planned.

04:33.508 --> 04:34.321
Impressive.

04:34.916 --> 04:37.823
I had a great teacher, right?
I learned a thing or two.

04:38.399 --> 04:40.892
I've got a long way to go
before I reach your level, though.

04:41.818 --> 04:44.905
Too much humility comes across as cheeky.

04:45.347 --> 04:46.215
Don't push your luck.

04:47.269 --> 04:48.404

04:54.162 --> 04:56.899
So you can look your best
for the cameras at the hearing.

05:01.775 --> 05:04.001
If I want to shine this brightly,

05:04.463 --> 05:07.984
I'll need the permission
of your mother-in-law first.

05:08.306 --> 05:09.167
No?

05:09.660 --> 05:12.490
Two days and I'll have it all sorted.

05:15.701 --> 05:16.915
You'll need to trust me.

05:18.604 --> 05:21.143
Of course I do.

Yes.

of Grandfather's death, right?

06:23.315 --> 06:24.913
I inform her
of the day's events every morning.

06:26.118 --> 06:27.603
So she's intentionally late?

I'll try contacting her again.

Don't.

That's why the people trust him.

10:33.786 --> 10:37.099

helped with securing the nomination.

10:38.094 --> 10:39.307

the Corruption Investigations Office?

10:48.604 --> 10:49.365
Exactly.

20:46.770 --> 20:49.009
It's been a long day. I should get going.

20:50.563 --> 20:51.424
Oh, hey honey.

20:59.494 --> 21:00.920
The sandwiches must have been great.

21:01.414 --> 21:03.122
I haven't even thought about dinner yet.

21:04.117 --> 21:07.787
Yeah, I'm in the office.
It should be safe to talk here.

21:09.308 --> 21:11.308
Right, so did you receive it okay?

21:12.067 --> 21:14.319
Sounds like you had a rough one.

21:15.525 --> 21:17.711
Anyway, finish things up there
and I'll see you at home later.

21:18.039 --> 21:19.242
Yep, thanks.

21:30.431 --> 21:32.615
Hey. Where you at, Dong-min?

21:34.279 --> 21:35.410
Let's make some news.

21:37.151 --> 21:39.120
Right, that one. Main story.

21:43.141 --> 21:45.208
Good luck with everything

21:46.129 --> 21:46.990
and see you at home.

22:26.131 --> 22:28.503
Stand up straight.

24:29.934 --> 24:31.242
Now, let's eat.

24:33.082 --> 24:34.355
Anything good there?

24:39.142 --> 24:40.595
What's this…?

24:42.628 --> 24:43.987
You know I don't want to be here.

24:44.028 --> 24:46.478
You think life
is about what you want?

24:47.214 --> 24:50.055
At your age you need to be
involved in your family.

25:02.192 --> 25:03.053
All right.

25:04.204 --> 25:07.128
Have you found a good candidate
for Prosecutor General?

25:07.981 --> 25:11.233
Yes. A few have made it
onto our final list,

25:12.830 --> 25:14.245
but they're all holding back.

25:15.074 --> 25:19.030
It's the reforms.
No one wants to stab peers in the back.

25:20.248 --> 25:22.141
And the job carries no power.

25:27.870 --> 25:29.248
If I put out feelers directly,

25:31.284 --> 25:32.413
would that help?

25:35.168 --> 25:36.732
What might you have in mind…?

25:38.202 --> 25:40.469
Prosecutorial reform isn't a problem.

25:41.144 --> 25:43.903
We can put on a show
and fire a few prosecutors

25:44.487 --> 25:47.147
and the people who want reform,

25:47.404 --> 25:49.337
they've got their own skeletons, right?

25:50.010 --> 25:51.037
Make sure they find out

25:51.078 --> 25:54.429
each other's dirty little secrets

25:54.460 --> 25:55.829
so they fight among themselves.

25:57.708 --> 25:59.525
Our prosecutors are working so very hard.

25:59.920 --> 26:02.631
We should do our best to protect them.

26:03.824 --> 26:05.872
Hurry, hurry!
It's time for the desserts!

26:05.903 --> 26:06.764
Okay.

26:08.302 --> 26:10.738
Oh, you'll give yourself indigestion.

26:12.279 --> 26:14.226
Sit and eat slowly.

26:14.401 --> 26:15.628
Already finished.

26:15.802 --> 26:17.096
Can I bring you anything else?

26:19.641 --> 26:21.548
The hot pepper paste is great.
Wrap a little up for me.

26:21.619 --> 26:24.136
No problem. I'll get that.

26:24.627 --> 26:25.833
Hurry up, guys!

26:29.117 --> 26:30.220
And then…

26:32.044 --> 26:33.238
Director of Corruption Investigation,

26:34.123 --> 26:37.037
we'll give that
to our party representative here.

26:37.749 --> 26:40.438
Assemblyman Kwak here
will lead the presidential elections.

26:41.943 --> 26:45.953
The Corruption Investigation Director
and Prosecutor General will work together.

26:46.620 --> 26:47.481
Yes, ma'am.

26:48.770 --> 26:52.156
Ah, editor-in-chief of the Hanju Daily,

26:52.389 --> 26:54.336
would you like to enter
the National Assembly?

26:55.413 --> 26:57.930
Oh, I… No, ma'am.

27:02.742 --> 27:05.355
If things work out as planned,

27:06.124 --> 27:09.812
it would be good to get
Cho Kang Hyun on the team, as well.

27:13.013 --> 27:16.636
I want it to be done quickly.

27:18.674 --> 27:22.092
Mom, so before Uncle dies,

27:23.202 --> 27:25.591
you're setting Jun-il up
to become the new chairman?

27:26.647 --> 27:28.434
So? Can't I?

27:30.225 --> 27:32.463
Ouch, I have to stretch my legs.

27:32.488 --> 27:35.237
Sit. You're the youngest one here.

27:35.935 --> 27:37.034
How dare you.

28:11.548 --> 28:13.428
I was wondering what you were up to.

28:14.010 --> 28:15.641
I said no one was to enter.

28:18.475 --> 28:19.336
Madam…

28:19.521 --> 28:21.230
If you've been talking a while,

28:21.551 --> 28:24.343
perhaps you can catch your breath
while watching the news.

28:25.650 --> 28:26.826
You'll enjoy it, Mother.

28:27.836 --> 28:29.725
What's up with you today?

28:34.117 --> 28:36.719
Good evening, this JBC Nightly News.

28:37.407 --> 28:38.634
Our first story tonight

28:39.106 --> 28:40.553
in a JBC News exclusive,

28:41.019 --> 28:43.935
[ACCOUNTING FRAUD AT SEONGJIN]
evidence of fraud at Sungjin Group.

28:44.798 --> 28:47.402
Leaked documents suggest
that from 2012 onward,

28:48.049 --> 28:51.530
Sungjin Group, in advance
of the Vice Chairman's planned succession,

28:52.112 --> 28:56.607
intentionally hid 4.5 trillion won
and covered up evidence of wrongdoing.

28:56.717 --> 28:59.139
Reporter Han Dong-min reports.

29:00.201 --> 29:04.639
Confidential documents
given anonymously to JBC

29:05.239 --> 29:08.535
detail evidence of accounting fraud

29:08.698 --> 29:10.913
that, in total, has sought
to conceal 4.5 trillion won,

29:11.199 --> 29:13.630
in a concerted effort ongoing since 2012.

29:14.173 --> 29:15.060
JBC News confirms-

29:17.006 --> 29:21.257
Hyeon-wu, you want to go see
the new motorbike?

29:23.870 --> 29:25.657
First, find the source of the leak.

29:26.010 --> 29:26.870
Yes, sir.

29:26.904 --> 29:29.088
Also, how great the leak-

29:29.113 --> 29:32.693
Trusting cats with fish, eh?

29:39.469 --> 29:41.624
It's not exactly a surprise, is it?

29:42.500 --> 29:45.320
We should have watched
Jun-hyeok from the beginning.

29:45.356 --> 29:46.217
I told you.

29:46.909 --> 29:48.990
If we had kept him here with us,

29:49.015 --> 29:50.908
that would have been so great.

29:51.736 --> 29:53.455
As a member of the press,

29:53.661 --> 29:56.839
he must have been conflicted,
whether to serve family or the public.

29:57.834 --> 30:00.416
Tough situation, poor kid.

30:01.748 --> 30:04.930
Did you really not know
what he and his wife were up to?

30:05.534 --> 30:08.442
Or, are you pretending you had no idea?

30:08.613 --> 30:10.213
What is she on about?

30:10.865 --> 30:14.647
Sorry, Dad.
We'll let you talk to Jun-il first.

30:32.289 --> 30:33.348
Outstanding.

30:34.413 --> 30:35.550
It wasn't easy,

30:36.620 --> 30:38.633
but that just made it more fun.

30:40.755 --> 30:43.812
All that time, shamelessly deceiving us…

30:46.819 --> 30:50.627
You always told me
that people never change.

30:52.052 --> 30:55.519
You said hiding the truth
is already halfway to success.

30:56.705 --> 30:58.728
Never reveal the sordid truth, right?

31:00.702 --> 31:02.362
I just did as you said.

31:02.595 --> 31:05.925
Stop messing around
and tell me what you want.

31:06.546 --> 31:07.407
Let's hear it.

31:09.093 --> 31:10.633
I want compensation,

31:11.115 --> 31:15.023
for all the times
you used me and my husband.

31:15.924 --> 31:18.535
All right. What compensation?

31:22.801 --> 31:26.217
Try to put yourself
in my shoes for a moment.

31:27.601 --> 31:28.834
What might I want?

31:29.707 --> 31:31.233
Think it over slowly

31:32.021 --> 31:33.430
and then make me an offer.

31:35.010 --> 31:38.000
Consider whether
that offer will satisfy me first, though.

31:51.359 --> 31:53.413
These outsiders come in and make a mess

31:53.466 --> 31:55.533
generation after generation.

31:57.074 --> 32:01.532
Come on, that's a bit harsh, isn't it?

32:02.079 --> 32:04.936
If it wasn't for Mother,

32:05.505 --> 32:07.411
would they be here with us?

32:08.137 --> 32:10.917
Living lives they don't deserve,
instead of repaying us,

32:11.441 --> 32:13.421
they act like ungrateful upstarts.

32:14.438 --> 32:15.445
Honey, stop.

32:15.812 --> 32:17.831
Why? It's all true.

32:18.608 --> 32:19.643
I appreciate the input.

32:22.011 --> 32:25.116
Please be forthright
during the investigation, Jun-il.

32:26.010 --> 32:27.543
The nation will be watching.

32:28.147 --> 32:31.160
Hey, Jae-hui.
You think we'll just let you do this?

32:31.437 --> 32:32.748
Everyone, stop.

32:33.497 --> 32:35.605
We don't need this, Dad. Let's go.

32:47.133 --> 32:49.143
Hyeon-wu! Time to go home!

32:50.447 --> 32:52.007
Don't you need to head home?

32:52.613 --> 32:55.450
Saw it all over the news sites.
Today's your grandfather's memorial, no?

33:00.213 --> 33:01.433
Everyone, everyone!

33:04.092 --> 33:06.978
Being first is great,
but being honest is better.

33:07.503 --> 33:09.144
Here's to being fair and accurate.

33:10.179 --> 33:12.239
Let's stay committed. Cheers!

33:12.652 --> 33:13.513
Cheers!

33:40.155 --> 33:41.155
Shall I get him washed up?

33:41.390 --> 33:43.518
No, it's fine. One night won't hurt.

34:05.180 --> 34:07.069
[JUN-HYEOK]
[BE BACK LATE. OUT WITH TEAM TONIGHT.]

34:15.201 --> 34:17.435
Take the night off.
I'm going to wash and head to bed.

34:17.621 --> 34:18.649
Shall I run the water?

34:18.674 --> 34:19.741
I'll do it.

34:31.493 --> 34:32.353
Strip.

34:34.628 --> 34:37.163
The wedding's next week,
so we'll need final confirmation.

34:38.308 --> 34:42.608
We can't let a girl who's pregnant with
another man's child join the family.

34:53.214 --> 34:54.831
Don't take it badly.

34:55.998 --> 34:57.938
Even if it's just in name only…

34:59.231 --> 35:01.794
you'll now become a member
of the Sungjin Group's family.

35:01.978 --> 35:03.438
You'll have to understand.

35:07.777 --> 35:09.741
Don't take it badly, Mother.

36:51.564 --> 36:53.031
Mom.

36:53.397 --> 36:55.619
Hey, did you sleep well?

36:58.678 --> 36:59.918
Had a good dream?

37:01.607 --> 37:03.144
Oh, Dad's up, too.

37:04.728 --> 37:05.589
- Dad!
- Hey.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.894
Honey, can you tell me
how to get up without an alarm?

37:09.959 --> 37:11.023
Wash your face first.

37:14.029 --> 37:15.137
Shall we wash our faces?

37:19.007 --> 37:20.951
Belief is key, really.

37:21.422 --> 37:22.942
Sounds like cult stuff.

37:24.317 --> 37:25.610
You don't want it enough.

37:26.054 --> 37:29.007
So the only way
to make it happen is to believe?

37:29.402 --> 37:30.902
No time for doubt.

37:30.950 --> 37:33.004
Yes, I believe. Amen.

37:33.916 --> 37:36.142
Anything to avoid that blasted alarm.

37:36.167 --> 37:38.729
That belief of mine made
the events of yesterday happen.

37:39.119 --> 37:42.454
"I can do this, it's possible."
A little positive thinking

37:42.598 --> 37:45.127
doesn't make you an egomaniac.

37:47.230 --> 37:49.023
Mother hasn't been in contact?

37:49.823 --> 37:51.440
Stop worrying about them.

37:52.171 --> 37:53.849
It's not very attractive.

37:55.756 --> 37:56.779
The ball's in her court now.

37:56.810 --> 37:57.671
Dad, move.

38:27.308 --> 38:28.855
So, what are you up to today?

38:30.095 --> 38:31.635
I'm gonna take a nap.

38:31.870 --> 38:34.641
Let's get you to the salon.
I'll make a reservation.

38:35.329 --> 38:36.190
Rather not.

38:36.329 --> 38:38.551
Come on, you need to look your best.

38:39.073 --> 38:43.111
You have to keep your hair
looking nice and tidy.

38:43.202 --> 38:45.040
Fine, fine.

38:48.725 --> 38:50.441
Do as you're told, kiddo.

38:50.472 --> 38:51.727
Don't baby me.

38:52.742 --> 38:53.671
What about me, Mom?

38:53.687 --> 38:56.122
- Jealous, huh?
- You want some, too?

38:57.197 --> 38:58.538
Pinch.

38:59.008 --> 38:59.869
Hello.

39:03.076 --> 39:04.243
Oh, hello there.

39:04.917 --> 39:06.316
Say hello, dear.

39:07.429 --> 39:08.693
Hello.

39:09.998 --> 39:11.671
Hi there.

39:15.183 --> 39:17.216
It's my husband's day off, and-

39:17.218 --> 39:18.432
You're the JBC anchor, right?

39:19.354 --> 39:20.612
Yes, that's right.

39:20.982 --> 39:22.302
I watch you all the time.

39:22.879 --> 39:23.822
Thank you very much.

39:25.220 --> 39:26.081
A fan, eh?

39:28.180 --> 39:30.633
Call me when you're done.
I'll try to come pick you up.

39:30.901 --> 39:31.762
Okay.

39:32.528 --> 39:33.895
Have fun at kindergarten, Hyeon-wu.

39:34.558 --> 39:36.341
- Good luck, Mom.
- Good luck!

39:37.226 --> 39:39.108
Hyeon-wu, watch your hands.

39:46.964 --> 39:47.825
Shall we?

39:54.100 --> 39:54.961
A student?

39:56.033 --> 39:56.997
One more semester.

39:58.308 --> 39:59.169
You're baby-faced, then.

39:59.952 --> 40:02.058
One or two years difference,
it still usually shows.

40:03.380 --> 40:05.630
I started late, so I'm 27 now.

40:06.746 --> 40:07.931
You seem to be cleverl.

40:08.910 --> 40:10.928
I like people who know what they want.

40:13.832 --> 40:16.358
You two seem quite happy.

40:18.247 --> 40:19.108
My husband and I?

40:21.205 --> 40:22.235
Glad you think so.

40:24.017 --> 40:25.261
You must really love each other.

40:31.002 --> 40:31.863
Why do you laugh?

40:33.281 --> 40:35.372
I guess I'm not used to it.

40:36.726 --> 40:37.587
Why not?

40:38.889 --> 40:40.823
Being so young,
I doubt you'd understand.

40:59.418 --> 41:00.335
Oh, hello.

41:01.550 --> 41:02.823
How are you today?

41:03.760 --> 41:05.558
I had planned to call,

41:05.609 --> 41:07.749
but once I checked
the time it was too late.

41:09.191 --> 41:11.819
Oh come on,
after the mess you made?

41:13.165 --> 41:16.058
Do you know who I'm off to meet now?

41:18.436 --> 41:19.266
My mother-in-law?

41:20.923 --> 41:22.636
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

41:23.498 --> 41:24.359
I'll call later.

41:26.954 --> 41:27.815
Madam Seo?

41:28.163 --> 41:29.024
Come inside.

41:33.144 --> 41:35.705
Director, the revisions are ready.

41:37.755 --> 41:38.616
Director?

41:39.609 --> 41:40.470
Yeah?

41:40.829 --> 41:41.743
The revisions.

41:42.939 --> 41:43.800
Oh, okay.

41:44.728 --> 41:45.589
Let's see.

42:06.015 --> 42:08.130
I see you've been working
with my daughter-in-law.

42:11.764 --> 42:13.953
We've known each other a long time.

42:15.481 --> 42:16.930
About 15 years now.

42:18.951 --> 42:21.418
Enough time to build trust, then.

42:24.218 --> 42:25.268
I think so, yes.

42:26.765 --> 42:29.043
She said you're not one
to put yourself in other's shoes,

42:29.504 --> 42:31.218
unable to imagine other perspectives,

42:31.998 --> 42:32.939
so I should believe her.

42:35.360 --> 42:37.740
That's true, I'm ashamed to say.

42:40.395 --> 42:41.425
I understand, though.

42:43.113 --> 42:46.542
You've lived your whole life
without ever being expected to do so.

42:48.790 --> 42:51.176
That's why you asked
for my husband's support of

42:52.382 --> 42:55.146
the Corruption Investigations Office
in return for his confirmation.

42:57.557 --> 43:00.951
Not everyone in the world
is here for your benefit.

43:04.939 --> 43:07.332
Have you spoken to her about this?

43:08.710 --> 43:10.313
That you'd met me first?

43:11.753 --> 43:13.505
There's no need for misunderstandings.

43:16.070 --> 43:18.577
If she finds out you're using her,

43:20.029 --> 43:21.720
wouldn't she feel betrayed?

43:25.514 --> 43:27.137
She won't like it, no.

43:30.093 --> 43:31.831
She's a woman of great ambition, Jae-hui.

43:33.049 --> 43:36.336
But she won't do anything rash over it.

43:40.416 --> 43:41.929
Despite being her mother-in-law,

43:43.118 --> 43:45.725
you know her much better than I do.

43:53.747 --> 43:55.519
Aside from my husband's confirmation,

43:57.224 --> 43:58.556
make Jun-hyeok

43:59.520 --> 44:01.520
Senior Secretary for Civil Affairs

44:03.683 --> 44:05.489
Tell Jun-hyeok to do his best

44:05.527 --> 44:07.345
to support my husband.

44:09.515 --> 44:11.173
If you support us
through the reform period

44:11.198 --> 44:14.125
until my husband becomes
the Corruption Investigations Director…

44:16.177 --> 44:17.038
the Sungjin Group

44:18.646 --> 44:22.049
will continue to contribute to our economy

44:23.193 --> 44:24.306
and enjoy our full support.

44:46.301 --> 44:48.295
Jae-hui, you did well.

44:49.141 --> 44:50.840
It went really well.

44:52.015 --> 44:55.237
Maybe it would be better to get
the full story from your mother-in-law.

44:57.103 --> 44:58.510
Good work, Madam Kwon.

44:59.284 --> 45:00.329
Drive safely now.

45:01.613 --> 45:04.034
Yes, I'll contact you later.

45:05.708 --> 45:06.569
Okay.

45:21.521 --> 45:23.027
He's coming out!

45:24.317 --> 45:26.230
They say you volunteered
to come in for questioning.

45:26.255 --> 45:28.240
Do you admit to the fraud allegations?

45:28.311 --> 45:31.015
Is it true that the slush funds
were used for bribes?

45:31.248 --> 45:34.619
Is it true that you lobbied
to reduce pressure on Geumsan Logistics?

45:35.014 --> 45:37.577
Is it true the secret funds are tied up
with the Freedom Revolution Party?

45:37.602 --> 45:40.039
Why did you volunteer
to meet with the prosecution?

45:52.495 --> 45:53.837
And my eldest daughter-in-law?

45:56.137 --> 45:57.312
She's at her mother's home.

46:00.208 --> 46:01.455
Call Jae-hui.

46:01.911 --> 46:02.789
Yes, ma'am.

46:41.529 --> 46:44.635
We should finalize things today, yes?

46:45.098 --> 46:46.888
I don't want to drag this out, either.

46:48.398 --> 46:51.147
Will Jun-hyeok really
accept the position?

46:52.080 --> 46:53.909
I doubt he'll be dead set against it.

46:58.915 --> 47:01.042
This inexhaustible confidence of yours…

47:01.849 --> 47:03.446
it's a strength and a weakness, you know.

47:04.548 --> 47:06.971
Mrs. Kwon really thinks the world of you.

47:09.055 --> 47:10.135
How'd you know

47:10.927 --> 47:12.496
that we're working together?

47:14.741 --> 47:16.835
Why? Feeling suspicious?

47:17.969 --> 47:19.528
Worried about the loyalty of your partner?

47:21.417 --> 47:24.766
And here you thought
I could never get in anyone else's shoes.

47:25.630 --> 47:28.165
But finding out who you're working with

47:28.190 --> 47:30.955
is really nothing for me.

47:32.292 --> 47:35.880
It doesn't matter to me whether
you two made another deal or not.

47:43.445 --> 47:44.306
Jun-il…

47:45.391 --> 47:47.002
I watched him go
into the Prosecutor's Office.

47:48.356 --> 47:49.217
I'm sorry to hear that.

47:51.343 --> 47:53.658
I'm betting with my son for this hand.

47:54.655 --> 47:55.993
What are you going to bet?

47:57.007 --> 47:57.868
Mother.

47:59.233 --> 48:00.525
We're not making a trade.

48:01.606 --> 48:03.722
You're in the weaker position here.

48:05.263 --> 48:07.396
The emphasis on prosecutorial reform

48:08.347 --> 48:11.075
has now shifted due
to the Sungjin Group investigation.

48:14.298 --> 48:17.055
It seems you think Jun-il is my weakness.

48:18.425 --> 48:20.305
What if I decide right now to refuse?

48:20.855 --> 48:22.447
What do you walk away with?

48:23.948 --> 48:25.941
If you can't even
put yourself in my place,

48:26.644 --> 48:29.223
how will you support
your husband's great ambitions?

48:32.832 --> 48:36.056
I stayed up all night
doing the homework you gave me.

48:37.351 --> 48:38.260
I'm disappointed.

48:39.943 --> 48:43.238
Why'd you do all this?
Why go through the trouble?

48:44.811 --> 48:47.715
You couldn't have acted
so recklessly just so your husband

48:47.955 --> 48:50.316
could become
Senior Secretary for Civil Affairs.

48:52.487 --> 48:53.348
Ah…

48:55.143 --> 48:56.577
So what you're hoping for

48:57.098 --> 48:59.256
is a five year stay in the Blue House*.
(House of the Korean President)

49:03.988 --> 49:05.542
Even though Jun-hyeok isn't my son-

49:05.580 --> 49:06.543
That again.

49:08.034 --> 49:09.926
How long will you be milking that?

49:11.731 --> 49:12.592
Listen till the end.

49:13.673 --> 49:15.946
Even if he's not of my blood,

49:16.646 --> 49:18.126
I raised him

49:18.761 --> 49:21.330
within my walls and with my two hands.

49:22.505 --> 49:24.824
Letting him work
for a man like Cho Gang-hyeon?

49:26.022 --> 49:28.641
I would never do that. Never.

49:33.456 --> 49:36.903
Use Senior Secretary for Civil Affairs
as a stepping stone for the presidency.

49:38.466 --> 49:40.060
If he becomes president,

49:40.724 --> 49:43.063
promise me that you'll let me decide
the Corruption Investigations Director.

49:44.263 --> 49:45.935
I'll give you all the help you need.

49:50.246 --> 49:52.252
You're not one to keep promises.

49:56.059 --> 49:57.265
You said if I had a son,

49:57.884 --> 50:00.549
you'd give me Sungjin stock…

50:01.595 --> 50:05.117
And here our son Hyeon-wu
is nearly in elementary school.

50:09.048 --> 50:10.361
So you're hung up on that, then.

50:10.600 --> 50:11.525
It stung a bit.

50:12.808 --> 50:16.238
I decided that if you wouldn't give it,
I'd just have to take it from you.

50:22.058 --> 50:22.919
Come with me.

51:38.442 --> 51:39.303
Go inside.

52:19.828 --> 52:21.270
Compiled from long ago…

52:22.621 --> 52:25.056
ledgers of the dirty secrets
of Korea's richest and most powerful.

52:26.742 --> 52:28.186
Every single infraction

52:28.211 --> 52:30.366
of every great person in the country,

52:30.883 --> 52:33.583
it's all compiled here in this room.

52:36.963 --> 52:39.465
Corruption Investigations is nothing.

52:41.714 --> 52:44.055
My father had a saying.

52:45.559 --> 52:48.749
True power resides in those
who have given out bribes.

52:50.717 --> 52:53.988
Those who take that money
never realize that truth.

52:54.785 --> 52:57.771
They think they're being given
that money because they're great.

52:59.609 --> 53:00.676
That stupidity,

53:02.249 --> 53:05.322
helped Sungjin Group weather it's storms

53:05.835 --> 53:08.652
and grow into what it is today.

53:12.433 --> 53:13.383
Corruption Investigations Director?

53:15.426 --> 53:18.331
Doesn't mean a thing to me.

53:19.717 --> 53:21.948
I just don't want
another fly in the ointment.

53:24.931 --> 53:26.298
I want to allow our leaders

53:27.055 --> 53:30.048
to do their work without
having to worry about being investigated.

53:33.747 --> 53:34.608
So?

53:42.181 --> 53:43.042
Would this…

53:44.268 --> 53:46.081
do something to heal your pain?

53:55.239 --> 53:56.100
However,

53:57.242 --> 53:58.617
if you fail, it's divorce.

54:00.545 --> 54:01.528
No alimony.

54:02.861 --> 54:05.265
You'll leave Hyeon-wu
and disappear from our lives.

54:07.212 --> 54:09.399
Will you give me your word?

55:03.841 --> 55:06.059
Madam Kwon. It's me, Jae-hui.

55:07.582 --> 55:09.396
You think I wouldn't know?

55:10.840 --> 55:14.057
Judging by your voice,
it sounds you've received something big.

55:14.993 --> 55:16.690
I'd hug you if you were here.

55:18.899 --> 55:22.744
But then, you have your husband for that.

55:23.981 --> 55:25.145
Sure, sure.

55:25.915 --> 55:28.768
Let's throw a big party to celebrate.

55:29.145 --> 55:31.746
Let's finally introduce our husbands.

55:32.571 --> 55:36.070
Right, yes. Have a great night.

55:39.267 --> 55:42.516
It sounds like good news, Sister.

55:43.130 --> 55:44.213
Shut up!

55:47.090 --> 55:49.123
You proud of being a mistress?

55:49.155 --> 55:51.426
Aren't you embarassed?

55:51.455 --> 55:54.885
You call yourself a mother? Huh?

55:55.549 --> 55:57.142
Wandering house to house,

55:57.213 --> 56:00.118
have you no sense of propriety?
You bitch!

56:00.270 --> 56:02.645
Sister, wait! Just a moment.

56:02.774 --> 56:05.479
Forgive me, please. Just this once.

56:05.504 --> 56:07.703
I won't do it again, I promise!

56:07.846 --> 56:09.277
Sister!

56:38.686 --> 56:39.547
Seon-mi.

56:40.435 --> 56:41.296
Yes, Madam.

56:42.371 --> 56:43.713
Get me Cho Gang-hyeon's file.

56:48.493 --> 56:50.646
What are the boys up to?
It's too quiet.

56:51.956 --> 56:54.030
Hyeon-wu fell asleep
right after eating,

56:54.247 --> 56:55.843
and your husband is at his games.

56:56.673 --> 56:57.534
Must be loving that.

56:57.899 --> 56:59.619
Can I get you dinner, ma'am?

56:59.726 --> 57:02.156
No. Strangely, I'm not hungry.

57:26.380 --> 57:28.266
Oh, hey.

57:28.797 --> 57:31.133
Wait, wait, just a second.

57:32.376 --> 57:33.458
Your hair looks great.

57:41.020 --> 57:42.338
That tickles.

57:43.439 --> 57:44.839
Be still.

57:45.220 --> 57:47.536
What are you up to? Huh?

57:48.928 --> 57:49.790
Oh.

57:50.757 --> 57:51.619
Oh my.

57:53.525 --> 57:54.632
That tickles.

58:27.934 --> 58:29.728
What a bumpkin,

58:30.403 --> 58:32.514
using this kind of cheap razor…

58:37.332 --> 58:38.194
Ow!

59:01.645 --> 59:03.229
I don't believe this.

59:04.681 --> 59:07.066
How many more times
before you'll learn your lesson?

59:31.609 --> 59:35.362
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

01:01:09.241 --> 01:01:12.448
[CHO GANG-HYEON]

01:01:23.999 --> 01:01:27.576
Will you be loyal to me?

01:01:28.812 --> 01:01:30.845
Of course I will.

01:03:36.389 --> 01:03:40.770
[ARTIFICIAL CITY]

01:04:00.013 --> 01:04:02.178
She killed herself over a video?

01:04:03.693 --> 01:04:05.060
Dispose of them.

01:04:05.368 --> 01:04:07.868
CrazyBitch2, that's No Yeong-ju.

01:04:07.996 --> 01:04:10.574
There's no need to use it again.

01:04:11.426 --> 01:04:12.288
Right there.

01:04:13.119 --> 01:04:15.839
Our docent must be
a fan of Jung Jun-hyeok.

01:04:16.637 --> 01:04:19.414
Only VIPs are allowed in there.

01:04:20.737 --> 01:04:23.728
Whatever happens,
I'll take care of Jung Jun-hyeok

01:04:25.732 --> 01:04:27.869
They have an arrest warrant.

01:04:28.041 --> 01:04:29.569
You want more, is that it?

01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:33.061
All of it. Everything you have, Mother.
