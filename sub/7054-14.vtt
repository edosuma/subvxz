WEBVTT

00:01.444 --> 00:04.386
I intend to restore balance
to our world.

00:04.454 --> 00:06.071
<i>Previously, on Fringe.</i>

00:06.139 --> 00:07.939
<i>An unstable wormhole
that would not close</i>

00:07.991 --> 00:09.774
<i>was quarantined by Fringe Division.</i>

00:09.826 --> 00:11.777
<i>Citizens encased
in quarantine amber</i>

00:11.845 --> 00:13.912
<i>have been ruled legally dead.</i>

00:13.963 --> 00:15.780
We gave you the ability
to identify

00:15.832 --> 00:17.833
things from the other side.

00:17.901 --> 00:20.586
Was it me who
described it as a glimmer?

00:20.637 --> 00:22.120
There's something that I have
to talk to you about.

00:22.172 --> 00:23.955
About her, fake Olivia.

00:24.007 --> 00:25.974
When you asked me to come back
to this world with you,

00:26.059 --> 00:27.959
- you said...
- That you belonged with me.

00:28.011 --> 00:29.895
And so I came back for you,

00:29.962 --> 00:31.597
and we started
seeing each other.

00:31.648 --> 00:33.215
I thought she was you, Olivia.

00:33.283 --> 00:35.767
She wasn't me.

00:35.818 --> 00:37.436
How could you not see that?

00:37.504 --> 00:38.570
Now she's everywhere.

00:38.638 --> 00:41.306
She's in my house,
my job, my bed.

00:41.357 --> 00:42.824
I don't want to live
in my apartment,

00:42.909 --> 00:44.293
and I don't want
to be with you.

00:47.197 --> 00:48.497
Okay, we need a secret word

00:48.581 --> 00:50.082
in case I need
to make a quick escape.

00:50.149 --> 00:51.450
You'll be fine.

00:51.501 --> 00:53.118
I just don't know
what I'm gonna talk about.

00:53.169 --> 00:54.620
Come on, they're my friends.

00:54.671 --> 00:57.289
Just as long as you don't
discuss religion or politics.

00:57.340 --> 00:58.790
Oh!

00:58.841 --> 01:01.877
Well, it is lovely weather
we're having today.

01:01.961 --> 01:04.596
See? You do smalltalk
just as good as anyone.

01:04.664 --> 01:06.265
Evenin', folks.
What unit?

01:06.332 --> 01:07.716
Uh, Kimball, 7-C.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.384
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

Oh, is the elevator
not working?

01:19.979 --> 01:21.363
No, it's workin'.

01:23.783 --> 01:25.033
Good luck.

01:40.500 --> 01:41.700
Evening, Mrs. Marcello.

01:41.751 --> 01:43.034
Where you heading?

01:43.086 --> 01:44.836
The Schrodinger Hotel,
on Flatbush.

01:44.887 --> 01:46.004
You're not leaving too,
are you?

01:46.055 --> 01:47.506
I can't take it anymore, Jimmy.

01:47.557 --> 01:48.757
I haven't slept in weeks.

01:48.841 --> 01:50.525
Come on, it's not that bad.

01:50.593 --> 01:52.210
Yet... And I'm not
sticking around

01:52.262 --> 01:53.428
to find out how bad
it's gonna get.

01:53.513 --> 01:55.013
I'm not spending another
minute in this building.

01:55.064 --> 01:57.399
All right, all right.
At least let me hail you a cab.

02:00.570 --> 02:02.104
See? I told you know
where Brooklyn is.

02:02.188 --> 02:04.856
- Oh, my God. You made it.
- Hi.

02:04.907 --> 02:07.075
You must be Chris.
It's so nice to meet you.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.076
California bubbly?

02:08.161 --> 02:09.610
Mm, I like him already.

02:09.696 --> 02:10.946
Come in, come in.

02:11.030 --> 02:12.281
Most people
are out on the balcony.

02:12.365 --> 02:13.282
Why don't you guys head out,

02:13.366 --> 02:14.283
and I'll get some drinks.

02:14.367 --> 02:15.417
Here, I'll come with you.

02:15.501 --> 02:16.568
Uh, wine?

02:16.619 --> 02:17.669
Surprise me.

02:18.755 --> 02:19.738
He is handsome.

02:19.789 --> 02:24.426
- And sweet and funny.
- And your age, finally.

02:24.510 --> 02:26.678
Hey, try some of this chicken.
It's amazing.

02:26.746 --> 02:28.046
He's great, and at this point,

02:28.097 --> 02:29.431
we're practically living together.

02:29.515 --> 02:31.133
- Really?
- Who are you living with?

02:31.217 --> 02:33.251
- Hey, Rick.
- Her boyfriend.

02:33.303 --> 02:35.804
So... Have you given him
a section of your closet?

02:35.888 --> 02:37.472
And half the medicine cabinet.

02:39.425 --> 02:41.926
- Rick!
- All right.

02:41.978 --> 02:44.780
All right, I'll call
the building manager.

02:44.864 --> 02:48.266
Yesterday, the stove comes on
completely by itself.

02:48.318 --> 02:49.601
Yeah, now we just
need to teach it

02:49.652 --> 02:51.269
to make us breakfast.

02:51.321 --> 02:53.271
Hey! I'm serious.
This is not funny.

02:53.323 --> 02:55.073
It's kind of funny.

02:55.124 --> 02:56.074
Yeah.

02:57.460 --> 02:58.744
Sylvia?

02:59.912 --> 03:00.945
Sylvia...

03:00.997 --> 03:02.280
You okay?
What's in those?

03:02.332 --> 03:04.449
I don't know, what's it?
Some type of barbecue?

03:04.500 --> 03:06.168
Get my... Get my purse!

03:06.252 --> 03:07.552
She's having some kind
of allergic reaction!

03:07.620 --> 03:08.754
Go get Chris!

03:10.340 --> 03:11.456
Where's Chris?

03:11.507 --> 03:12.891
- I'm Chris.
- Sylvia can't breathe.

03:12.958 --> 03:14.059
She needs her purse.

03:14.126 --> 03:15.260
It's with her coat.

03:18.598 --> 03:21.066
To the Schrodinger,
corner of Flatbush...

O.J., fresh fruit...

04:05.862 --> 04:08.647
What's the occasion, Walter?

04:08.698 --> 04:10.532
Oh, nothing special.

04:10.616 --> 04:12.651
But for the past
couple of weeks,

04:12.702 --> 04:14.653
no new cases and...

04:14.704 --> 04:16.855
Somehow that
has translated into...

04:16.906 --> 04:18.123
Never seeing Olivia.

04:18.190 --> 04:20.190
And I, for one, miss her.

04:21.711 --> 04:23.745
Any reason why you didn't
mention this to me last night?

04:23.830 --> 04:25.831
Well, would you believe
it slipped my mind?

04:25.882 --> 04:27.466
No, I would not.

04:29.585 --> 04:30.752
You know, Walter,

04:30.837 --> 04:32.053
whatever's happening
between Olivia and I...

04:32.138 --> 04:33.889
Or not happening,
as the case may be...

04:33.973 --> 04:35.640
Is really between us.

04:35.708 --> 04:37.342
It's none of your concern.

04:38.594 --> 04:41.212
Your happiness is my concern.

04:41.264 --> 04:43.148
And while that's very sweet,

04:43.215 --> 04:45.350
I'm begging you, please...

04:45.401 --> 04:46.818
Don't try and force things,
okay?

04:46.886 --> 04:48.403
I'm not forcing anything.

04:55.328 --> 04:56.578
Good morning, Walter.

04:56.662 --> 04:57.696
Yes, it is.

04:57.747 --> 04:59.498
It's good to see you, dear.

05:01.734 --> 05:03.702
So what was so important?

05:03.753 --> 05:06.004
Hmm? Important?

05:06.071 --> 05:07.172
Breakfast.

05:07.239 --> 05:09.073
The most important meal
of the day,

05:09.125 --> 05:11.510
and I proved it in 1973.

05:11.577 --> 05:13.178
Blueberry pancakes.

05:13.245 --> 05:15.747
This a Bishop family specialty

05:15.798 --> 05:17.716
best eaten while still warm.

05:17.767 --> 05:19.217
Walter, you didn't
have to do this.

05:19.268 --> 05:20.919
That's exactly what I told him.

05:20.970 --> 05:23.188
Ooh, there's something missing.

05:28.361 --> 05:30.695
He wants us to spend
time together.

05:30.763 --> 05:32.096
The three of us?

05:34.767 --> 05:37.268
No, just the two.

05:39.205 --> 05:40.205
Walter!

05:44.794 --> 05:45.777
He's not lying, though.

05:45.828 --> 05:48.580
The pancakes are fantastic.

05:53.118 --> 05:55.303
I'm gonna head back
to the office.

05:57.456 --> 05:58.473
Olivia.

06:01.293 --> 06:04.646
Look, I don't approve
of his methodology,

06:04.730 --> 06:06.765
but... Since we're here,

06:06.816 --> 06:08.433
we might as well take
advantage of the situation

06:08.484 --> 06:10.802
and just talk about
what's bothering you.

06:14.473 --> 06:17.192
I don't really know
what to say.

06:23.499 --> 06:27.252
Look, I know that you
still think about her.

06:27.319 --> 06:28.787
I know you had
feelings for her.

06:28.838 --> 06:30.338
And that you still do.

06:30.423 --> 06:31.823
And, frankly,

06:31.891 --> 06:34.876
I don't think you've been
completely honest with me.

06:36.045 --> 06:37.012
Well, you're right.

06:37.096 --> 06:39.381
I mean, I haven't
told you everything.

06:39.465 --> 06:41.299
Mostly because
I didn't think that you...

06:41.350 --> 06:43.184
That I could handle it?

06:44.804 --> 06:46.771
I know that you struggle
with trust issues.

06:46.839 --> 06:48.440
You have a difficult time
letting people in.

06:48.507 --> 06:51.142
Well, I... I'm struggling
because the reasons are real.

06:51.193 --> 06:54.012
- I'm not making them up.
- I know.

06:54.063 --> 06:56.031
I never wanted to be
one of the reasons.

06:59.652 --> 07:01.352
And I still think about her,

07:01.404 --> 07:02.704
because I spent
so long imagining

07:02.788 --> 07:04.489
going down that path with you.

07:04.540 --> 07:05.824
Imagining what it would be like

07:05.875 --> 07:07.375
to wake up in a bed
next to you.

07:07.460 --> 07:08.760
To sit around,
just the two of us

07:08.828 --> 07:11.195
having a cup of coffee,
reading the paper.

07:11.247 --> 07:14.549
And then finally, I had it.

07:14.634 --> 07:17.302
I've seen what the two of us
together looks like.

07:17.369 --> 07:20.255
And it's beautiful.

07:20.339 --> 07:22.057
Peter, she's the one
that took it away from us,

07:22.141 --> 07:23.341
not me.

07:23.392 --> 07:25.043
And now?

07:28.197 --> 07:30.932
Who's the one stopping us now?

07:42.678 --> 07:43.728
Dunham.

07:46.198 --> 07:48.016
Yes, sir.
We'll be right there.

07:55.229 --> 07:56.313
I'm gonna go get Walter.

07:56.397 --> 07:57.397
Okay.

07:59.734 --> 08:00.867
Hey, Cupid!

08:02.787 --> 08:04.237
Did my plan work?

08:04.288 --> 08:06.156
Well, if your plan
was to make things

08:06.240 --> 08:07.457
even more awkward and painful

08:07.542 --> 08:09.826
between Olivia and I,
yeah, worked like a charm.

08:09.911 --> 08:12.412
Perhaps I should have
made a frittata.

08:12.463 --> 08:14.748
Six people attending a party

08:14.799 --> 08:17.417
on the seventh floor
fell to their deaths last night.

08:19.921 --> 08:21.421
One second, they were
standing on the balcony.

08:21.472 --> 08:22.839
They next second,
they were hitting the sidewalk.

08:22.924 --> 08:23.840
What, they all jumped?

08:23.925 --> 08:25.291
Like a flash mob...

08:25.343 --> 08:26.426
Of suicide.

08:27.895 --> 08:29.729
But jumpers don't usually
take their patio furniture

08:29.797 --> 08:32.097
when they commit suicide.

08:32.149 --> 08:33.732
They find any structural damage

08:33.801 --> 08:35.101
to the balcony
they were standing on?

08:35.152 --> 08:38.020
First responders
didn't detect anything.

08:38.105 --> 08:40.823
That doorman, Jimmy Smith,
was on duty when they fell.

08:43.277 --> 08:45.662
Okay, well,
I'll meet you guys upstairs.

08:47.782 --> 08:50.200
Jimmy, I'm, uh,
Agent Olivia Dunham.

08:50.284 --> 08:52.202
I was wondering if I could
ask you a couple questions

08:52.286 --> 08:53.954
about what happened here
last night.

08:54.005 --> 08:56.673
I don't know...
I don't know what happened.

08:56.757 --> 08:59.175
I was helping Mrs. Marcello
hail a cab and then...

08:59.260 --> 09:01.761
This body just... hit the ground.

09:01.829 --> 09:03.713
Then another and then...

09:03.798 --> 09:05.215
They all just came down.

09:05.299 --> 09:06.332
But at once?

09:06.384 --> 09:08.351
Like they all jumped
at the same time?

09:11.689 --> 09:13.773
Maybe it's true
what they say about this place.

09:13.841 --> 09:16.593
What do they say?

09:35.630 --> 09:37.998
Sylvia has a peanut allergy,

09:38.049 --> 09:40.834
and I guess something
that we had catered

09:40.885 --> 09:41.968
triggered an attack.

09:42.036 --> 09:44.588
I ran out to the balcony
to get her boyfriend.

09:46.357 --> 09:49.259
We were so busy
with Sylvia that...

09:49.343 --> 09:50.727
by the time we heard
the screams,

09:50.811 --> 09:54.230
everyone was... gone.

09:56.484 --> 09:57.934
Don't be a daredevil.

09:58.019 --> 09:59.352
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.

10:05.059 --> 10:07.077
I don't think
these people jumped.

10:07.161 --> 10:09.579
You're right.

10:09.664 --> 10:12.082
And even if they just...
went over the railing,

10:12.166 --> 10:13.667
they would have
landed farther out.

10:13.734 --> 10:14.751
Yeah.
Simple physics.

10:14.835 --> 10:17.587
Instead... They landed
directly below us.

10:17.672 --> 10:21.407
It's as if they went
straight through the balcony.

10:24.378 --> 10:26.296
Let's not push it, all right?

10:26.380 --> 10:28.298
It's fascinating.
How... How do six people

10:28.382 --> 10:30.467
fall though a solid floor?

10:30.551 --> 10:32.102
Uh, ghosts.

10:32.186 --> 10:33.720
Apparently the residents think

10:33.771 --> 10:35.722
that the Rosencrantz Building
is haunted.

10:35.773 --> 10:37.857
Apparently, unexplained phenomena

10:37.925 --> 10:39.309
has been happening here
for a while.

10:39.393 --> 10:40.777
Unexplained phenomena?

10:40.861 --> 10:42.979
Yeah, the water pipes
would be replaced,

10:43.064 --> 10:44.648
and then two days later,
explode.

10:44.732 --> 10:48.151
Or the electricity will go on
and then go off, unexplained.

10:48.235 --> 10:50.203
People have been
reporting odd sounds.

10:50.270 --> 10:53.039
That described just about every,
single prewar building.

10:53.107 --> 10:56.042
Well, half the tenants
have already moved out.

10:56.110 --> 10:57.827
Now that people have
fallen through the balconies,

10:57.912 --> 10:59.663
I'm pretty sure they're
about to lose the other half.

10:59.747 --> 11:01.998
Any ideas, Walter?

11:02.083 --> 11:04.117
I know what's happening here.

11:04.168 --> 11:06.720
Ten times,
I've flipped this coin.

11:06.787 --> 11:08.888
And ten times,
I've gotten heads!

11:08.956 --> 11:11.508
That's fairly inconceivable.

11:11.592 --> 11:14.811
The laws of physics are
being disrupted here.

11:14.895 --> 11:16.980
The balcony...
Here one second,

11:17.064 --> 11:19.349
- gone the next.
- What are you saying, Walter?

11:19.433 --> 11:20.650
That, like the other universe,

11:20.735 --> 11:24.154
our world is starting
to come apart at the seams.

11:26.807 --> 11:29.659
And the tear is
beginning right here!

11:33.447 --> 11:34.748
Damn it.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.367
Walter, what
are you looking for?

11:37.451 --> 11:38.585
My seismograph.

11:38.652 --> 11:41.337
How am I supposed
to measure micro-quakes

11:41.422 --> 11:42.956
without my damn seismographs?

11:43.007 --> 11:45.041
Walter, we keep 'em
in the back.

11:45.126 --> 11:47.544
Then why are you all
sitting around?

11:49.213 --> 11:50.663
I'll go get it.

11:53.333 --> 11:54.634
You know, a thank you
wouldn't kill you.

11:54.685 --> 11:57.020
Oh, I'm sorry if
at this moment,

11:57.104 --> 11:58.555
when the universe
is collapsing,

11:58.639 --> 12:01.224
I forgot the magic word.

12:01.308 --> 12:02.976
Walter, I understand
that you're worried,

12:03.027 --> 12:04.277
but at the moment,
we don't know for sure

12:04.344 --> 12:05.862
that what we're dealing with
is a soft spot.

12:05.946 --> 12:08.565
It is not a soft spot, dear.

12:08.649 --> 12:10.116
It is a hole,

12:10.184 --> 12:13.186
which could potentially
lead to a vortex.

12:13.237 --> 12:15.205
Right, with the operative word
being potential.

12:15.289 --> 12:16.906
Yes, agreed, we need proof.

12:16.991 --> 12:18.124
And that's where you come in.

12:18.192 --> 12:22.162
I want all the data we can
glean from that location.

12:22.213 --> 12:23.880
Digital spectrometer.

12:23.964 --> 12:26.132
Radiological survey meter.

12:26.200 --> 12:29.385
We need to track
any irregularities.

12:29.470 --> 12:30.670
Walter, this is still hypothetical.

12:30.721 --> 12:34.390
Peter, I know that this is not
exactly precise science.

12:34.475 --> 12:37.844
Perhaps you'd prefer
that I put Olivia

12:37.895 --> 12:40.430
into a heightened state
of fear and anxiety

12:40.514 --> 12:43.099
in the hopes that she
may get a glimmer

12:43.184 --> 12:44.601
from the other side.

12:44.685 --> 12:45.852
That's not what I meant.

12:45.903 --> 12:47.737
Here's your seismograph.

12:47.822 --> 12:49.906
Thank you, Astrid.

12:49.990 --> 12:52.575
Okay, Walter, we're gonna go
set this up at the Rosencrantz.

12:52.660 --> 12:55.662
If any seismic activity happens,
you'll be the first to know.

12:55.729 --> 12:57.747
Uh, yes.
Thank you!

12:57.832 --> 13:01.234
Please! Hocus pocus!
Whatever you want to hear.

13:04.672 --> 13:08.291
Walter, what's all that about?

13:08.375 --> 13:09.408
Nothing.

13:12.412 --> 13:15.181
Do you remember
the chemical attack

13:15.249 --> 13:17.183
on the commuter bus
some years ago?

13:17.251 --> 13:19.219
Yeah, it was one
of our first cases.

13:19.270 --> 13:20.520
I want the case file,

13:20.587 --> 13:23.306
and I want my lab notes
for the case, please.

13:23.390 --> 13:25.225
How come?

13:25.276 --> 13:27.644
Oh, dear God.

13:27.728 --> 13:30.280
Is it "second guess
everything I do" day?

13:30.364 --> 13:32.532
Because I haven't
been informed.

13:33.784 --> 13:35.535
I'll get you the file, Walter.

13:45.290 --> 13:47.508
Okay, the seismograph is online.

13:47.593 --> 13:49.627
All right, Walter,
we've got everything set up.

13:50.996 --> 13:55.716
Well, can't you
do that from there?

13:55.801 --> 13:57.518
Okay, fine.

13:57.603 --> 13:58.936
We'll stay here.

14:00.171 --> 14:01.806
Yeah. Bye.

14:01.857 --> 14:03.858
- You're kidding.
- He wants us to stay here.

14:03.942 --> 14:05.509
I mean, he knows
it's twelve degrees out here?

14:05.561 --> 14:07.612
He said to stay close
in case we have any

14:07.679 --> 14:09.179
last-second calibrations.

14:13.184 --> 14:15.119
Do you really think that
this is the end of the world

14:15.186 --> 14:16.787
as we know it?

14:16.855 --> 14:17.955
If it is, there's no reason

14:18.023 --> 14:19.407
to wait outside
in the cold for it.

14:19.491 --> 14:20.625
There's a bar
right across the street.

14:20.692 --> 14:22.293
Wait, you think
that now is the time

14:22.360 --> 14:23.461
to be throwing back shots?

14:23.528 --> 14:25.129
Who said anything
about downing shots?

14:25.196 --> 14:26.247
Maybe they got fries.

14:28.083 --> 14:31.035
Well, now you're talking.

14:31.086 --> 14:34.972
- Evening, Mrs. Merchant.
- Hello, Jimmy.

15:33.231 --> 15:35.783
Mystery selection, coming up.

15:35.867 --> 15:37.318
Is it "Feelings"?

15:37.402 --> 15:38.452
No.

15:39.821 --> 15:41.205
Did I ever tell you
about the time

15:41.272 --> 15:42.406
Walter did his rendition of

15:42.457 --> 15:43.941
"Never, Never Gonna
Give You Up" for me?

15:43.992 --> 15:45.793
No, but I actually love Barry White.

15:45.877 --> 15:47.628
He was only wearing
his socks at the time.

15:47.713 --> 15:49.413
- Uck.
- He was doing the hustle.

15:49.464 --> 15:52.049
- There was a lot going on.
- Okay, that's enough.

15:56.304 --> 15:59.724
You know when you were
talking earlier about...

15:59.791 --> 16:02.643
What it felt like when
you thought you were with me?

16:02.728 --> 16:05.763
And you said that...

16:05.814 --> 16:07.565
It was beautiful.

16:07.632 --> 16:09.466
Yeah.

16:11.153 --> 16:13.020
I want to know what
that feels like.

16:19.945 --> 16:23.480
But...

16:42.968 --> 16:44.552
Olivia? What?

16:45.971 --> 16:47.271
I just need to get some air.

16:47.338 --> 16:48.856
I'm sorry.

16:59.618 --> 17:01.736
Olivia.

17:01.820 --> 17:03.237
Look, whatever that was,

17:03.321 --> 17:04.521
if you think
that it's a mistake...

17:04.573 --> 17:07.023
Peter... You glimmered.

17:07.075 --> 17:08.576
When we kissed, you glimmered.

17:12.864 --> 17:15.199
So you're afraid.

17:17.419 --> 17:20.921
- Afraid of what?
- That you were right.

17:21.006 --> 17:22.973
That this isn't just about her.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.925
It was, but I think
that this is me.

17:25.010 --> 17:26.343
I think that I'm stopping us.

17:26.394 --> 17:29.930
Maybe I'm just incapable
of being vulnerable.

17:30.015 --> 17:30.931
Olivia, come on,

17:31.016 --> 17:32.266
you know that that's not true.

17:32.350 --> 17:33.934
It must be.

17:34.019 --> 17:35.569
I'm terrified.

17:35.654 --> 17:37.154
That I can't fix this.

17:37.222 --> 17:40.891
That... That this
is just who I am.

17:57.425 --> 17:58.575
What do you see?

18:19.898 --> 18:20.865
Peter?

18:20.932 --> 18:22.199
Are you getting these readings?

18:22.267 --> 18:23.484
What's happening?

18:23.568 --> 18:24.869
I don't know.
I'll call you right back.

18:24.936 --> 18:26.704
Peter?

18:54.632 --> 18:56.633
What happened?

18:56.685 --> 18:58.102
Who was he?

19:00.155 --> 19:01.638
My husband.

19:01.690 --> 19:04.358
His ghost.

19:17.817 --> 19:19.768
Nothing.

19:19.819 --> 19:21.403
I thought there'd be
some radiation leakage

19:21.470 --> 19:22.804
from over there.

19:22.855 --> 19:24.906
So you're not buying
that it's her husband's ghost?

19:24.973 --> 19:27.242
There's no such thing
as ghosts.

19:27.309 --> 19:28.777
That's where you draw the line?

19:28.828 --> 19:29.828
Ghosts?

19:31.330 --> 19:33.748
Belly and I used to argue
about this constantly...

19:33.816 --> 19:36.984
What happens to the
body's energy after death.

19:37.036 --> 19:38.787
William theorized
we should be able

19:38.838 --> 19:40.505
to capture that energy

19:40.589 --> 19:42.757
using what he called
soul magnets.

19:42.825 --> 19:43.958
It's a catchy name.

19:45.344 --> 19:46.461
He said if he were right,

19:46.512 --> 19:49.647
he would contact me
from the great beyond.

19:49.715 --> 19:51.983
I haven't gotten the call yet.

19:53.519 --> 19:55.603
Well, if she didn't
see her husband's ghost,

19:55.671 --> 19:57.689
then what did
Mrs. Merchant see?

20:02.945 --> 20:04.979
Mrs. Merchant...

20:05.030 --> 20:07.482
When was the first time
you saw you saw your husband?

20:07.533 --> 20:08.850
You mean after he died?

20:11.954 --> 20:14.489
He's been visiting...

20:14.557 --> 20:16.074
for a couple months now.

20:16.158 --> 20:18.376
Oh.

20:18.461 --> 20:21.496
Looks like you two
were together for a long time.

20:21.564 --> 20:27.051
Almost 45 years.

20:27.136 --> 20:28.870
These photographs are beautiful.

20:28.921 --> 20:30.672
Was he a photographer?

20:30.723 --> 20:32.423
He liked to pretend he was.

20:32.508 --> 20:34.142
Oh.

20:34.209 --> 20:35.927
When we'd travel,

20:36.011 --> 20:39.481
he'd tell people we worked
for <i>National Geographic</i>.

20:39.548 --> 20:41.432
Oh, oh, I know that that...

20:41.517 --> 20:42.684
That sounds horrible.

20:42.735 --> 20:45.553
- No.
- But that little fib

20:45.604 --> 20:50.558
got us into a few restricted
but spectacular places.

20:50.609 --> 20:54.028
We never had children, so...
That was our thing.

20:54.079 --> 20:56.063
Huh.

20:57.616 --> 21:01.870
We made a hell of a team.

21:01.921 --> 21:05.072
Forgive me,
but how did Derek die?

21:05.124 --> 21:09.127
It was stupid.

21:09.211 --> 21:11.212
The fuse box blew,
like it always did.

21:11.263 --> 21:15.183
And we flipped a coin,
like usual.

21:15.250 --> 21:17.886
Whenever there was a chore,
neither of us wanted to do,

21:17.937 --> 21:20.522
we'd flip for it.

21:20.589 --> 21:23.525
Derek lost this time.

21:23.592 --> 21:26.528
There was a short
in the wiring.

21:26.595 --> 21:28.429
He died instantly.

21:28.480 --> 21:30.815
After his death,
you must have been devastated.

21:30.900 --> 21:33.267
Is that when he
started coming to you?

21:33.319 --> 21:35.787
No.

21:35.871 --> 21:41.108
I couldn't get out of bed
after the funeral.

21:41.160 --> 21:43.611
We'd been together
since we were twenty.

21:45.915 --> 21:47.882
He was part of me.

21:47.950 --> 21:49.617
Then he was gone.

21:55.624 --> 21:58.543
So when did you first see him
after he died?

21:58.611 --> 22:01.980
A few days after.

22:02.064 --> 22:03.631
Around dinner.

22:09.271 --> 22:11.472
For a second, I forgot.

22:11.523 --> 22:16.277
I wondered what Derek
was in the mood to eat.

22:16.328 --> 22:19.747
And then I remembered...

22:19.815 --> 22:21.482
He was gone.

22:23.652 --> 22:26.838
And all I felt was despair.

22:26.922 --> 22:29.173
All I wanted was him.

22:30.926 --> 22:34.162
Even if that meant...
dying myself.

22:38.384 --> 22:40.385
And that's when he came.

22:42.137 --> 22:44.022
He came to be with me.

22:45.557 --> 22:48.526
When I needed him.

22:48.611 --> 22:51.562
How long did you two live here?

22:51.647 --> 22:53.581
Oh...

22:53.649 --> 22:55.199
Over forty years.

22:57.319 --> 22:59.570
Derek owned this apartment.

22:59.655 --> 23:03.491
I moved in after we got married.

23:03.559 --> 23:05.543
Oh.

23:05.628 --> 23:08.696
Walter, why did you
ask that question?

23:08.747 --> 23:09.797
How long had she lived here?

23:09.865 --> 23:12.133
What... What does it matter?

23:12.200 --> 23:14.168
Because...

23:14.219 --> 23:16.804
If her husband had
this apartment,

23:16.872 --> 23:17.905
then it stands to reason

23:17.973 --> 23:19.257
that her husband's double

23:19.341 --> 23:21.876
may have this apartment
on the other side.

23:21.927 --> 23:26.180
Which proves I'm right.

23:26.231 --> 23:30.435
The universe is breaking apart
at this very spot.

23:30.519 --> 23:33.187
That woman is seeing through
to the other side

23:33.238 --> 23:35.740
and mistaking the other Derek
for her husband.

23:35.824 --> 23:37.342
Which is why I can see him too.

23:37.409 --> 23:38.726
Yes!

23:38.777 --> 23:41.395
And if the fabric
separating our universe

23:41.447 --> 23:47.035
is so thin that Mrs. Merchant
can see through it...

23:47.086 --> 23:48.870
This is not good at all.

23:48.921 --> 23:51.238
Walter, I understand
why she can see through

23:51.290 --> 23:53.074
and I can't, but... How is it

23:53.125 --> 23:54.459
that Mrs. Merchant
can see through?

23:54.543 --> 23:58.212
Right now, I'm not
interested in how, Peter.

23:58.263 --> 24:00.748
I'm more concerned
about what happens next.

24:00.799 --> 24:02.266
Which is...

24:03.802 --> 24:08.356
Imagine this is the soft spot
in the universe...

24:08.423 --> 24:10.108
But every incident...

24:13.228 --> 24:14.562
weakens it a little more.

24:14.630 --> 24:15.813
Until, eventually...

24:18.117 --> 24:19.567
A vortex...

24:19.618 --> 24:20.918
A gaping hole,

24:20.986 --> 24:23.705
that sucks in and obliterates
everything around it.

24:23.772 --> 24:26.407
Just like we've seen
happen on the other side.

24:26.458 --> 24:29.043
- Walter, I found it.
- Oh.

24:29.111 --> 24:30.244
Good.
What took so long?

24:30.295 --> 24:33.114
The FBI had transferred
the case files to Massive Dynamic.

24:33.165 --> 24:34.465
Which file?

24:34.550 --> 24:36.884
The commuter bus attacks
several years ago.

24:36.952 --> 24:37.952
How is that relevant?

24:38.003 --> 24:39.921
I've been worried about this

24:39.972 --> 24:42.306
since we returned
from the other side.

24:42.391 --> 24:45.760
How we would respond
if a vortex opened up here.

24:45.811 --> 24:47.962
How we would plug the bridge.

24:48.013 --> 24:49.480
Walter, please don't
tell me that you're thinking...

24:49.565 --> 24:50.515
What am I missing?

24:50.599 --> 24:53.735
We would do the same thing
as they did over there.

24:57.990 --> 24:59.524
The government asked us
to analyze this

24:59.608 --> 25:00.908
for its military properties.

25:00.976 --> 25:03.244
No one had ever seen
anything like it before,

25:03.311 --> 25:04.328
so there was concern.

25:04.413 --> 25:06.280
With good reason.

25:06.331 --> 25:08.116
If I'm right,
this has a composition

25:08.167 --> 25:11.652
similar to the material
that Walternate uses.

25:11.703 --> 25:13.588
We need half a dozen
of our best scientists.

25:13.655 --> 25:16.290
And that... nervous fellow,
Brandon.

25:16.341 --> 25:18.459
Dr. Bishop,
let me get this straight.

25:18.510 --> 25:19.761
Are you really suggesting

25:19.828 --> 25:21.879
that the FBI encase
that building in amber?

25:21.964 --> 25:24.832
Perhaps the whole block.

25:24.900 --> 25:26.934
Tell them they can
refer to my lab notes.

25:27.002 --> 25:28.169
Oh, stop, Walter.

25:28.220 --> 25:29.637
I mean, we've seen what
the amber's done

25:29.688 --> 25:31.722
to the other side,
with thousands of people trapped.

25:31.807 --> 25:33.024
Not to mention
the public reaction.

25:33.108 --> 25:34.308
We'd be looking
at mass hysteria.

25:34.359 --> 25:35.777
I understand,
but how do you think

25:35.844 --> 25:36.978
the public will react

25:37.029 --> 25:39.981
if that soft spot
turns into a vortex?

25:40.032 --> 25:42.950
A black hole that swallows up
half of Brooklyn.

25:47.739 --> 25:48.823
We should get started.

25:48.874 --> 25:51.008
Okay, I understand

25:51.076 --> 25:52.743
that it's a last resort,
but it's a bad last resort.

25:52.828 --> 25:55.012
Well, you know more about this
than any of us do.

25:55.080 --> 25:56.514
What's the protocol
they use over there?

25:56.582 --> 25:59.150
Okay, well,
the Fringe team goes in

25:59.218 --> 26:01.368
and, uh, assesses
the scope of the damage.

26:01.420 --> 26:03.588
Then they set a perimeter.

26:03.672 --> 26:04.806
They evacuate as many
people as they can.

26:04.873 --> 26:06.424
Once the canister is in place,

26:06.508 --> 26:07.809
the gas is dispersed,

26:07.876 --> 26:10.311
and within seconds,
the amber solidifies.

26:13.048 --> 26:14.398
I need to run this
up the channels.

26:14.466 --> 26:16.984
Not exactly how you imagined
meeting the President, huh?

26:17.052 --> 26:19.237
I already know him.

26:19.321 --> 26:22.056
He doesn't like me.
I beat him at golf.

26:24.543 --> 26:26.077
What are you thinking?

26:26.161 --> 26:29.330
Well, uh, I understand
Walter's concerns,

26:29.397 --> 26:30.748
but there's got to be
another way, right?

26:30.833 --> 26:32.667
I'm gonna access
the information that we've got

26:32.734 --> 26:35.069
on the other soft spots.

26:35.120 --> 26:36.871
Walter still doesn't understand
what's causing the incidents.

26:36.922 --> 26:38.506
But if this is a new soft spot,
then why there?

26:38.573 --> 26:39.590
Why that building?

26:39.675 --> 26:40.741
If we could figure that out,

26:40.792 --> 26:42.176
maybe we could figure out
how to stop it.

26:42.244 --> 26:44.712
Okay, well, let's pull up
all the geological reports

26:44.763 --> 26:46.214
from the Rosencrantz as well,

26:46.265 --> 26:47.682
going back to the first
reported incident,

26:47.749 --> 26:49.350
and see what we're missing.

26:51.687 --> 26:54.588
We've narrowed down the parameters
based on your notes.

26:54.640 --> 26:57.258
And we think this mixture
should replicate

26:57.309 --> 27:00.895
the compound
you're looking for.

27:00.946 --> 27:02.947
So how's it going?

27:06.118 --> 27:08.319
Walter, are you all right?

27:14.326 --> 27:15.910
For a long time,
I've been willing

27:15.961 --> 27:18.379
to think the worst
of Walternate.

27:18.446 --> 27:20.781
That he was an evil man.

27:20.832 --> 27:22.466
Willing to use
any means necessary

27:22.551 --> 27:25.619
to get what he needed.

27:25.671 --> 27:30.291
I suppose it made it easy
to justify what I did.

27:30.342 --> 27:33.978
Now we're faced
with the same decision.

27:34.062 --> 27:38.816
And I'm arguing that we do
exactly what he did.

27:38.901 --> 27:41.269
What sort of person
does that make me?

27:41.320 --> 27:43.821
One who's asking
the right questions.

27:43.906 --> 27:46.307
You don't think he
grappled with them too?

27:52.447 --> 27:54.198
The compound is ready, Sir.

27:58.820 --> 28:01.122
There's nothing unusual
beneath the surface.

28:01.173 --> 28:02.924
There's no subway tunnels,

28:02.991 --> 28:04.926
no major utility lines.

28:04.993 --> 28:06.377
I mean, what are we missing?

28:08.997 --> 28:09.931
Hey...

28:09.998 --> 28:12.433
I'm sorry, um...

28:12.500 --> 28:14.135
The woman who lost her husband,

28:14.202 --> 28:16.470
Alice Merchant...

28:16.538 --> 28:18.806
Why can she see through
to the other side?

28:18.874 --> 28:20.524
You can do it,

28:20.609 --> 28:23.577
but only when your...
Your emotions are heightened.

28:23.645 --> 28:25.062
That emotional intensity
is your trick.

28:25.130 --> 28:26.480
Well, she's grieving
her husband.

28:26.531 --> 28:27.815
That's emotionally intense.

28:27.866 --> 28:29.533
Sure, but people lose
loved ones all the time.

28:29.618 --> 28:31.202
It's sad, but what
makes her so unique?

28:31.286 --> 28:33.487
Yeah, and...
And why can she only see

28:33.538 --> 28:35.406
her husband's double
and not her own?

28:35.490 --> 28:37.575
I mean, if they both live
on the other side,

28:37.659 --> 28:39.126
then she should
see them both, right?

28:41.029 --> 28:43.581
Maybe the other Alice
lost the coin toss.

28:43.665 --> 28:45.666
She told you they used
to flip a coin

28:45.717 --> 28:47.134
to see who was gonna
have to go fix the fuse.

28:47.202 --> 28:48.336
Well, maybe the exact,
same thing

28:48.387 --> 28:49.804
happened on the other side,
but on the other side...

28:49.871 --> 28:52.306
Alice died instead of Derek.

28:52.374 --> 28:53.591
Okay, well...

28:53.675 --> 28:55.643
What if we've been
looking at this all wrong?

28:55.710 --> 28:56.978
What if this is not
about physics,

28:57.045 --> 28:58.095
but about people?

28:58.180 --> 28:59.930
Go on.

29:00.015 --> 29:01.432
Is it possible
that these two people,

29:01.516 --> 29:03.517
both grieving for a version
of each other

29:03.568 --> 29:05.186
in the exact same spot,

29:05.237 --> 29:07.288
are somehow causing
this soft spot?

29:07.356 --> 29:11.409
Some fort of emotional
quantum entanglement.

29:11.493 --> 29:13.995
Perhaps.

29:14.062 --> 29:15.830
"Spooky action at a distance."

29:15.897 --> 29:18.332
Einstein.

29:18.400 --> 29:20.418
Two objects
interacting with each other

29:20.502 --> 29:21.952
even though they're separated
by a great distance.

29:22.037 --> 29:23.671
Man had a way with words.

29:23.738 --> 29:24.755
So it is possible.

29:24.840 --> 29:25.773
In theory!

29:25.841 --> 29:27.208
I'd have to test it.

29:27.259 --> 29:29.460
And I'd have to figure out
how to do that.

29:29.544 --> 29:31.128
Dunham.

29:31.213 --> 29:32.513
Olivia, I'm picking up

29:32.580 --> 29:34.965
all kinds of seismic
activity in Park Slope.

29:35.033 --> 29:38.352
It's happening again.

29:49.931 --> 29:52.716
South side of the street
is clear, Sir.

29:52.767 --> 29:54.401
Move west and merge
with Team Bravo.

29:54.485 --> 29:57.154
I want an update in five.

29:57.221 --> 29:58.388
Is that the ambering device?

29:58.439 --> 30:00.724
I've prepared
a remote detonator,

30:00.775 --> 30:02.326
so your agent won't
get caught in it.

30:02.393 --> 30:04.227
You two, take this cylinder.

30:04.279 --> 30:05.996
Place it in the stairwell,

30:06.063 --> 30:08.332
then report
directly to me, quickly.

30:08.399 --> 30:10.784
Sir, uh, I think that
there's another option.

30:10.869 --> 30:12.085
Short version...

30:12.170 --> 30:14.538
The woman who can
see through to the other side,

30:14.589 --> 30:15.873
what if whatever freak accident

30:15.924 --> 30:17.507
that killed her husband
over here

30:17.575 --> 30:19.209
also killed the wife
over there?

30:19.260 --> 30:21.795
And this intense grief
that they're both experiencing

30:21.880 --> 30:24.181
is somehow blending
our universes together?

30:24.248 --> 30:26.750
You think all of this
is because of feelings?

30:26.801 --> 30:28.635
Some naturally occurring
chemicals in the body

30:28.720 --> 30:30.220
are like Cortexiphan,

30:30.271 --> 30:31.271
which allows Olivia
to see the other side,

30:31.356 --> 30:32.556
but only when she's afraid.

30:32.607 --> 30:34.090
We don't know how her emotions
allow her to do that,

30:34.142 --> 30:35.225
but we know that they do.

30:35.276 --> 30:38.278
Dr. Bishop,
is there any merit to this?

30:38.363 --> 30:39.596
There's a chance.

30:39.647 --> 30:42.699
But quantum entanglement
is a tricky business.

30:42.767 --> 30:44.601
I'm not sure.

30:44.652 --> 30:45.702
<i>Sir, we've got a resident</i>

30:45.770 --> 30:46.703
<i>that's refusing to vacate.</i>

30:46.771 --> 30:48.322
<i>Merchant, 6B.</i>

30:48.406 --> 30:50.106
<i>- Please advise.</i>
- That's her.

30:50.158 --> 30:51.909
Pulling her out won't help.

30:51.960 --> 30:53.076
Proximity is irrelevant.

30:53.127 --> 30:54.745
If Peter and Olivia are right,

30:54.796 --> 30:57.614
and this couple is responsible
for what we are seeing,

30:57.665 --> 31:01.585
then it doesn't matter
if they're inches apart or miles.

31:01.636 --> 31:03.220
The subatomic connection
is the same.

31:03.287 --> 31:06.173
She needs to break
that connection,

31:06.257 --> 31:07.557
and let go on her own.

31:07.625 --> 31:09.259
Well, what do you suggest?

31:09.310 --> 31:10.394
We convince her that
it's not her husband

31:10.461 --> 31:11.678
that she's holding onto.

31:11.763 --> 31:14.314
- And that'll make this stop?
- Possibly.

31:14.399 --> 31:18.468
But before we resort to amber,
we have to try.

31:18.519 --> 31:19.987
If I give the order,

31:20.071 --> 31:21.405
I want you two out immediately.

31:21.472 --> 31:22.806
No hesitation.
Understood?

31:22.857 --> 31:24.241
- Yes, sir.
- Go!

31:49.934 --> 31:51.685
He's already here.

31:53.554 --> 31:54.838
- Alice...
- Go away.

31:54.889 --> 31:55.856
I don't want you here.

31:55.940 --> 31:58.508
Alice, what I'm
about to tell you

31:58.559 --> 31:59.643
is gonna be hard to understand.

31:59.694 --> 32:01.845
But everything that is
happening in this building

32:01.896 --> 32:03.363
is happening because of you.

32:03.448 --> 32:07.034
Because of you and Derek.

32:07.118 --> 32:09.820
Now, you're the only person
that can stop it.

32:09.871 --> 32:12.289
But to do that,
you need to let him go.

32:12.356 --> 32:13.690
I won't do that.

32:13.741 --> 32:15.459
I can understand how you feel.

32:19.130 --> 32:20.664
Okay, Alice,
the man you're seeing,

32:20.715 --> 32:23.216
he's not a ghost,
and he's not your husband.

32:23.301 --> 32:25.502
He looks like Derek.
He looks exactly like Derek.

32:25.553 --> 32:26.503
Then who is he?

32:36.597 --> 32:37.764
How long do we have?

32:37.849 --> 32:39.016
There's no way to know.

32:39.067 --> 32:40.984
Sir, the device is in place.

32:41.052 --> 32:44.488
I want all teams
behind the line, immediately.

32:44.555 --> 32:45.689
Yes, sir.

32:50.061 --> 32:51.445
You're wrong.

32:51.529 --> 32:52.529
I swear to you.

32:52.580 --> 32:54.197
The man that you're seeing,

32:54.248 --> 32:55.866
he's from another place.

32:55.917 --> 32:57.200
He's from another world.

32:57.251 --> 32:58.452
What are you talking about?

32:58.536 --> 33:00.504
In his world,
he lost his wife too.

33:00.571 --> 33:02.706
And she looked exactly like you.

33:02.757 --> 33:04.374
He's making the same mistake
that you are.

33:04.425 --> 33:06.209
He thinks that you're his wife.

33:06.260 --> 33:07.677
Now, I know this sounds insane,

33:07.745 --> 33:09.846
but all those people
that fell from the balcony,

33:09.914 --> 33:11.081
they all died because

33:11.132 --> 33:13.467
you two couldn't
let go of each other.

33:13.551 --> 33:15.685
All of this is happening
because of you,

33:15.753 --> 33:19.923
and you can stop it if you
just let go of him.

33:19.974 --> 33:20.941
Alice...

33:21.025 --> 33:21.975
Love...

33:22.060 --> 33:23.643
It's me.

33:23.728 --> 33:26.396
I can hear you.

33:26.447 --> 33:28.565
Derek, I hear you!

33:29.734 --> 33:31.201
Olivia...

33:31.268 --> 33:32.569
I can see him too now.

33:32.620 --> 33:33.787
Sweetheart...

33:33.871 --> 33:36.540
- I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

33:41.829 --> 33:42.879
Was that...

33:42.947 --> 33:45.082
That shimmering,
was that was I think it was?

33:45.133 --> 33:46.550
Seeing the other side.

33:46.617 --> 33:49.086
Yes... We all are.

33:49.137 --> 33:51.004
Dunham, Bishop,
I want you out of there now!

33:51.089 --> 33:54.341
Do you copy?

33:54.425 --> 33:55.592
I repeat, do you...

33:55.643 --> 33:58.929
There's so much more
to tell you.

33:58.980 --> 34:01.181
Things I never got
a chance to say.

34:01.265 --> 34:03.100
I don't think the building
can take much more of this.

34:03.151 --> 34:04.601
Well, she won't let go.

34:09.607 --> 34:11.574
What's happening?

34:11.641 --> 34:13.643
Rapid shifts in
barometric pressure.

34:13.694 --> 34:15.145
Static electricity.

34:15.196 --> 34:17.164
Dr. Bishop...

34:20.168 --> 34:21.918
It's a vortex.

34:21.985 --> 34:24.121
It's starting.

34:47.422 --> 34:51.759
How do I trigger
the amber, Dr. Bishop?

34:51.844 --> 34:53.043
Turn it on.

35:00.736 --> 35:01.769
Pull out the pin.

35:06.241 --> 35:08.192
Evacuate now, do you hear me?

35:08.243 --> 35:09.444
That's a direct order!

35:09.528 --> 35:11.779
Alice, you have
to listen to us.

35:11.864 --> 35:13.448
That man is not your husband.

35:13.532 --> 35:15.083
Who is that?
Who are those people with you?

35:17.586 --> 35:19.170
Alice, please.

35:19.237 --> 35:21.422
Look at me.

35:21.507 --> 35:22.507
You need to let him go.

35:22.574 --> 35:24.959
How can you ask me that?
I can't.

35:25.044 --> 35:26.461
I can't!

35:26.545 --> 35:27.512
I just can't!

35:27.579 --> 35:28.579
I know, I know.

35:28.631 --> 35:31.916
But you've already had
what most of us only dream of.

35:31.967 --> 35:33.968
A lifetime with
the person you love.

35:34.053 --> 35:35.887
Look around you.

35:35.938 --> 35:37.755
Your entire house
is filled with mementos...

35:37.806 --> 35:39.140
Photographs, ticket stubs.

35:39.224 --> 35:41.442
Evidence of a life
shared with somebody.

35:41.527 --> 35:45.429
Proof that what you and Derek
had was true and real.

35:45.481 --> 35:46.698
And I know that
when you have something

35:46.765 --> 35:48.766
so real, you'll do anything
to keep from losing it.

35:48.817 --> 35:51.285
But please,
you have to let him go.

35:51.370 --> 35:55.272
Alice, I miss you so much.

35:55.324 --> 35:56.824
And the girls miss you.

36:03.549 --> 36:05.466
We never had children.

36:05.551 --> 36:08.920
Of course we did.

36:11.840 --> 36:13.624
No.

36:18.981 --> 36:20.798
I'm not your wife.

36:23.235 --> 36:25.302
Your wife is gone.

36:28.323 --> 36:30.858
And so is my Derek.

36:43.422 --> 36:44.455
<i>We're good up here.</i>

36:44.506 --> 36:46.323
<i>Everything okay down there?</i>

36:59.337 --> 37:01.272
I know that it's
a lot to take in.

37:04.226 --> 37:07.478
I'm not sure I'll ever
really understand what happened.

37:07.529 --> 37:12.734
And I'm not sure it would
make any difference if I did.

37:12.818 --> 37:16.821
You know...
Today was something

37:16.872 --> 37:19.323
I never could have imagined.

37:19.374 --> 37:21.976
But if the impossible

37:22.044 --> 37:27.115
is... possible...

37:27.182 --> 37:28.532
Who's to say that someday

37:28.584 --> 37:30.468
I won't see him again?

37:33.222 --> 37:35.372
Maybe you will.

37:48.654 --> 37:49.987
Walter...

37:51.890 --> 37:53.908
The custodian
would like to vacuum.

37:56.862 --> 37:59.614
Just a few more minutes.

37:59.698 --> 38:01.115
Lovely view, isn't it?

38:01.183 --> 38:05.419
You saved the lives
of a lot of people today.

38:05.504 --> 38:08.890
And you should feel very proud.

38:08.957 --> 38:10.758
No.

38:10.843 --> 38:12.409
Today wasn't a victory.

38:12.461 --> 38:16.413
Today was a vision
of things to come.

38:16.465 --> 38:18.916
Walter, now,
you don't know that to be true.

38:18.967 --> 38:21.085
Unfortunately, I do.

38:23.421 --> 38:24.972
If the vortex had opened,

38:25.057 --> 38:27.692
I would be able to seal it.

38:27.759 --> 38:29.927
And then there would
be new cracks

38:29.978 --> 38:31.679
and we would seal those cracks,

38:31.747 --> 38:33.881
and those cracks
in our universe

38:33.949 --> 38:36.684
would beget
larger cracks and...

38:38.603 --> 38:42.540
Over there, decades
of research and funding...

38:42.607 --> 38:46.110
The best solution Walternate
could come up with was this.

38:47.830 --> 38:50.631
And it won't be enough.

38:50.699 --> 38:52.633
Once the universes
start to unravel,

38:52.701 --> 38:55.503
there'll be no stopping it.

38:55.587 --> 38:57.438
I don't know how to stop it.

38:59.141 --> 39:00.391
Well, then...

39:00.458 --> 39:03.311
I think you need to learn.

39:23.699 --> 39:26.500
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:27.920 --> 39:29.754
I'm sorry, I thought
maybe you were Walter.

39:29.821 --> 39:31.289
Oh... Is he missing?

39:31.340 --> 39:33.090
No, he stayed down in New York.

39:33.158 --> 39:34.458
What's up?
Is everything all right?

39:34.509 --> 39:35.593
Yeah.

39:35.661 --> 39:38.012
Um...

39:38.096 --> 39:39.130
I might be being presumptuous,

39:39.198 --> 39:42.266
but, um...
I was thinking maybe...

39:44.219 --> 39:45.353
Yeah, of course.
Come on in.

39:46.722 --> 39:49.357
I'll get us some glasses.

39:56.064 --> 39:57.681
To disaster narrowly averted.

39:57.733 --> 40:00.351
Or at least postponed.

40:15.384 --> 40:18.002
Peter, what you said
to Mrs. Merchant...

40:23.842 --> 40:26.594
I want what you want.

40:32.601 --> 40:34.485
What do you think
we should do about that?

41:01.096 --> 41:04.181
Am I glowing?

41:04.249 --> 41:05.849
No.

41:48.176 --> 41:51.679
- Anything?
- Mm...

41:51.763 --> 41:53.230
Nothing.

41:53.298 --> 41:57.051
All readings are within
normal parameters.

41:57.119 --> 41:58.436
That's weird, 'cause Astrid

41:58.487 --> 42:00.554
reported a class four event
at this location,

42:00.622 --> 42:01.638
and she's never wrong.

42:01.690 --> 42:03.024
Did you check the batteries?

42:03.108 --> 42:04.775
Um... Yeah.

42:13.201 --> 42:14.985
Agent Dunham with Fringe Division.

42:15.037 --> 42:16.537
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

42:16.621 --> 42:18.873
But I was wondering if you
happened to have noticed

42:18.957 --> 42:20.841
anything strange going on
in the area?

42:20.926 --> 42:22.376
No, nothing.

42:22.461 --> 42:24.661
Okay. Uh, what about your family?
Maybe they...

42:24.713 --> 42:26.380
No, uh, I live alone here.

42:26.465 --> 42:28.349
My wife died
a couple months ago.

42:28.433 --> 42:29.550
Oh, I'm sorry.

42:29.634 --> 42:31.001
Well, if you do happen
to notice something,

42:31.053 --> 42:32.002
please call the hotline.

42:32.054 --> 42:33.270
- Yeah.
- Okay.

42:33.338 --> 42:34.972
Thank you so much
for your time.

42:39.394 --> 42:41.896
Cancel the quarantine protocol.

42:41.980 --> 42:43.364
If there was a rift here,

42:43.448 --> 42:45.866
- it's closed now.
- Hmm.
