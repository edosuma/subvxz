03:32.447 --> 03:34.547
- That sure was nice.
- It was, yeah.

03:34.549 --> 03:37.319
What am I wearing?

03:38.453 --> 03:39.852
Barbecued steak?

03:39.854 --> 03:41.754
Dan's steakhouse?

03:41.756 --> 03:44.690
- Steakhouse...
- Maisie, the door's open!

03:44.692 --> 03:46.726
- Does she have a friend round?
- No.

03:46.728 --> 03:50.162
No?
And then that waiter!

03:50.164 --> 03:51.697
Boring holes into your behind

03:51.699 --> 03:53.798
every time you went
to the restroom.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.734
Who does that?

03:55.736 --> 03:57.669
The Italian way, huh?

03:57.671 --> 03:59.939
Next time we're going
to my restaurant downtown.

03:59.941 --> 04:01.607
These Italian waiters,

04:01.609 --> 04:03.709
they like looking at your wife
when you're having a meal.

04:03.711 --> 04:06.612
That is not what happened!

04:06.614 --> 04:09.715
No, the guy was
a dull young punk.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.650
A dull young punk,
I should've rushed him.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.719
And she left
the water running.

04:13.721 --> 04:16.322
We're home, sweetheart.

04:16.324 --> 04:18.392
Maisie?

04:21.829 --> 04:23.598
Maisie?

04:25.699 --> 04:27.569
Honey?

04:28.802 --> 04:31.404
Someone's been in the house.

04:31.406 --> 04:33.509
Maisie?

04:35.276 --> 04:37.646
- Maisie?
- Maisie?

04:41.281 --> 04:43.317
Maisie?

04:45.853 --> 04:47.689
Maisie?

04:48.855 --> 04:50.826
Maisie?

06:05.632 --> 06:08.901
Hey. Genghis?
Come on, boy. Genghis!

06:08.903 --> 06:12.937
What's that? Hey?
Yeah, what's that? Come! Come!

06:12.939 --> 06:15.774
Come! Yeah!

06:15.776 --> 06:19.914
Did you miss me?
Huh? Did you miss me?

06:24.918 --> 06:26.721
Hey.

06:28.923 --> 06:30.891
Come here.

06:36.096 --> 06:39.031
Appreciate it, huh?

06:39.033 --> 06:41.870
Hey. Tough day.

06:46.708 --> 06:48.406
What do you guys want to drink?

06:48.408 --> 06:50.409
- What are we eating?
- Takeout.

06:50.411 --> 06:51.476
Beer's fine, Liv.

06:51.478 --> 06:52.911
- What takeout?
- Pizza.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.714
Who's been sleeping
on the couch?

06:55.716 --> 06:57.849
- I'll have a beer.
- Anything, Liv. A beer's good.

06:57.851 --> 07:00.118
- Yeah, I'll have a beer, too.
- Oh, will you?

07:00.120 --> 07:01.620
Let me help, Olivia.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.488
No, it's fine, Arlene.
Me and Ray have got it.

07:03.490 --> 07:04.889
Mom, can I have a beer,
please?

07:04.891 --> 07:07.493
I'll get you a beer
if you entertain.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.762
- TV's cheating!
- TV's entertainment!

07:09.764 --> 07:11.062
Not if it's that crap you watch.

07:11.064 --> 07:13.365
Anything with prominent sounds
and bright colors

07:13.367 --> 07:16.569
should be enough to engage
your simplistic mind, Billy.

07:16.571 --> 07:18.671
TouchÃ©.

07:18.673 --> 07:21.740
You and your big mouth.

07:21.742 --> 07:24.543
I was just wondering
why Ray's been couched.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.945
It doesn't necessarily
mean that.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.848
No, Uncle Morgan's right.

07:28.850 --> 07:31.052
You're officially
sitting on Dad's bed.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.990
'Over in Blue Hill County, we
see a lot of electrical storms

07:38.992 --> 07:41.594
'moving southeast
later on this evening.'

07:41.596 --> 07:42.961
'...responsible

07:42.963 --> 07:44.897
'for the widespread power
outages across the board.'

07:44.899 --> 07:47.966
'It is believed Maisie was taken
from her home around 4:00pm

07:47.968 --> 07:50.668
'while her parents
were visiting the local town.

07:50.670 --> 07:52.570
'A memorial service
was held this afternoon

07:52.572 --> 07:54.072
'at Blue Hill County
Elementary School

07:54.074 --> 07:57.510
'as today marks a year
since her disappearance.

07:57.512 --> 07:59.512
'First, I would like us
to welcome someone

07:59.514 --> 08:00.980
'who has a few words to say

08:00.982 --> 08:04.416
'on the general safety and
surveillance of our community:

08:04.418 --> 08:05.918
'Maisie's Uncle

08:05.920 --> 08:08.988
'and our very own Blue Hill
County Police Deputy Sheriff,

08:08.990 --> 08:11.990
- 'Kenneth Burroughs.'
- 'Firstly,

08:11.992 --> 08:16.461
'I'd like to thank you all
for coming here today.

08:16.463 --> 08:17.962
'As you are aware,

08:17.964 --> 08:22.637
'it's a year to the day
that Maisie went missing.

08:24.137 --> 08:28.876
'But we're not gathered
here today to remember that.

08:31.678 --> 08:34.447
'We're gathered here today

08:34.448 --> 08:38.450
'to remember
how joyful she was

08:38.452 --> 08:41.054
'and how happy
she always seemed.

08:43.224 --> 08:44.956
'And I'm, uh...

08:44.958 --> 08:49.027
'I'm sure you'll all agree
with me when I say how smart

08:49.029 --> 08:51.899
'and how capable she was.

08:53.801 --> 08:57.203
'Maisie really was very special.

08:57.205 --> 09:01.540
'There was something
incredibly unique about her,

'and we all saw it.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.014
'All of us.'

09:11.519 --> 09:12.888
No TV.

09:36.043 --> 09:39.545
Do you remember
when Mom died

09:39.547 --> 09:41.914
and Dad would always be off,

09:41.916 --> 09:44.749
working or whatever,

09:44.751 --> 09:46.954
and I had to look after you?

09:51.792 --> 09:54.593
This is the same.

09:54.595 --> 09:57.032
Just a little bit different.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.005
I'm here for you.

10:09.644 --> 10:12.176
Anyway,

10:12.178 --> 10:15.680
it was always me
looking after you, dummy.

10:15.682 --> 10:18.019
No!

10:21.822 --> 10:24.225
Ahem!

10:27.227 --> 10:29.695
You got a drink problem!

10:29.697 --> 10:31.564
I have a drink problem!

10:31.566 --> 10:33.132
Says who?

10:33.134 --> 10:37.069
So how long did it take you
to get all this done?

10:37.071 --> 10:42.307
How long is it since I had
pizza? I don't eat pizza.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.676
I hardly ate any of that.

10:44.678 --> 10:48.613
So, Billy, I was expecting
to see, uh...

10:48.615 --> 10:50.148
- Jeez, what was her name?
- Jenny.

10:50.150 --> 10:53.352
Jenny. That's it.
Is she, uh...

10:53.354 --> 10:56.188
I mean, uh...

10:56.190 --> 10:58.357
What happened to her?
What happened to Jenny?

10:58.359 --> 11:02.062
- It wasn't working out.
- Could you pass the ketchup?

11:04.097 --> 11:06.699
- Noah.
- What?

11:06.701 --> 11:09.068
- Don't.
- Don't what?

11:09.070 --> 11:12.637
Pass the sauce to your uncle
like a normal human being.

11:12.639 --> 11:15.273
Don't pass the sauce to my uncle
like a normal human being?

11:15.275 --> 11:17.943
Just do it, please.

11:17.945 --> 11:21.180
That's a real shame
about Jenny.

11:21.182 --> 11:22.147
She was a great girl.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.682
- Yeah, Jenny's...
- She was a great girl!

11:24.684 --> 11:26.852
Jenny's great. Uhm...

11:26.854 --> 11:28.653
But we had our differences.

11:28.655 --> 11:30.254
- When did it happen?
- Few months back.

11:30.256 --> 11:32.824
I'm sorry to hear that, bud.

11:32.826 --> 11:35.194
It was for the best.

11:35.196 --> 11:38.066
Billy was gonna propose to her.

11:41.369 --> 11:46.041
But he got scared, and
Billy doesn't face his fears.

11:47.774 --> 11:49.407
He just runs.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.278
Ain't that right, Billy?

11:54.148 --> 11:56.084
Yeah, Ray, that's right.

11:58.818 --> 12:00.219
You're a dick!

12:00.221 --> 12:02.090
Not today!

12:03.289 --> 12:05.059
Please, Noah!

12:05.993 --> 12:08.826
Just sit down
and finish your dinner.

12:08.828 --> 12:10.764
I've already finished.

12:16.937 --> 12:20.075
Well, there it is.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.283
Excuse me.

12:33.953 --> 12:37.825
Martha and I
actually planned on having kids.

12:39.693 --> 12:41.193
I just wanted one or two,

12:41.195 --> 12:44.065
but she, like,
wanted twenty or thirty.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.235
You know how she was.

12:49.703 --> 12:52.438
And then, when...

12:52.440 --> 12:55.010
when Martha passed...

12:56.043 --> 12:58.145
I just felt like
my life was over.

12:59.245 --> 13:01.479
I felt crippled,

13:01.481 --> 13:04.248
like life wasn't
worth living anymore.

13:04.250 --> 13:08.389
And then, in time,
I managed to pick myself up.

13:11.826 --> 13:14.229
My life was never over...

13:15.361 --> 13:17.298
It was just hard to see.

13:21.469 --> 13:24.368
Grief is blinding.

13:24.370 --> 13:27.105
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- She needs you right now.

13:27.107 --> 13:30.242
I do not want to talk about it,
Morgan.

13:30.244 --> 13:32.312
I think you need some time.

13:35.081 --> 13:36.147
It's been a year.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.783
But only six hours
since you made peace with it.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.017
Made peace?

13:40.019 --> 13:42.220
You know that ain't
what I'm saying, Ray.

13:42.222 --> 13:46.458
I ain't never
making peace with it.

13:46.460 --> 13:48.363
You know what I mean, Ray!

13:50.297 --> 13:51.430
Oh...

13:51.432 --> 13:53.831
Oh, come on!

13:53.833 --> 13:55.233
Ray!

13:55.235 --> 13:58.173
You know I didn't mean it
to sound like that.

14:03.277 --> 14:04.879
Goddammit.

14:08.115 --> 14:10.250
I searched for days.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.224
I didn't sleep.

14:17.957 --> 14:20.060
I didn't eat.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.298
I didn't stop.

14:24.398 --> 14:26.367
I couldn't...

14:29.302 --> 14:31.002
I know...

14:31.004 --> 14:34.208
I know you know all this,
but...

14:35.842 --> 14:37.843
The truth is...

14:37.845 --> 14:41.216
The truth is...
I let you down.

14:43.017 --> 14:46.020
You, Ray, Noah...
I let this family down.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.423
And that...

14:50.423 --> 14:53.191
that guilt, that...

14:53.193 --> 14:56.264
well, this feeling
of helplessness...

14:58.532 --> 15:01.402
I feel responsibility,
I feel...

15:03.870 --> 15:06.307
I just...
I just wanted you to know...

15:07.607 --> 15:10.441
how sorry I am, Olivia.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.313
This family is everything to me.

15:14.315 --> 15:15.416
Everything.

15:16.317 --> 15:18.986
Stop apologizing.

15:21.455 --> 15:23.191
I'm gonna check on Noah.

16:54.148 --> 16:56.580
- What's up?
- Oh, hey.

16:56.582 --> 16:59.483
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, just, uh...

16:59.485 --> 17:02.621
Gregory Mathison's boys
are messing around out back,

17:02.623 --> 17:04.589
lighting flares.

17:04.590 --> 17:07.528
Just gonna go have
a polite word with them.

17:08.428 --> 17:12.229
Ray...
You sure you're all right?

17:12.231 --> 17:14.498
Yeah, I'm fine, Arlene.
Honestly.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.300
I won't be five minutes.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.202
What's the trouble?

17:18.204 --> 17:20.505
Oh, just some kids
messing around out back.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.673
He wants to go have
a polite word with them.

17:22.675 --> 17:25.609
They're playing with those
goddamn flares again.

17:25.612 --> 17:28.580
They'll spook the dog.
It could be dangerous.

17:28.582 --> 17:31.182
Well, Reese Jordan's on duty.
I'll give him a call.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.450
- Yeah.
- God!

17:32.452 --> 17:34.419
Maybe it's best.
Just leave it to the Sheriff.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.090
Olivia!

17:38.692 --> 17:40.191
Look...

17:40.193 --> 17:42.526
I'm just gonna drive down
the track, cut them off,

17:42.528 --> 17:44.662
have a civilized conversation
with them.

17:44.664 --> 17:47.132
Failing that, I'll drive
straight to their home

17:47.134 --> 17:48.632
and have a civilized
conversation

17:48.634 --> 17:50.434
with Gregory Mathison instead.

17:50.436 --> 17:52.770
The last time you had a
civilized conversation with him

17:52.772 --> 17:55.606
you ended up spending the night
in a cell, remember?

17:55.608 --> 17:58.075
Gee, thanks for that
convenient reminder, Billy.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.544
Anytime, Ray.

17:59.546 --> 18:02.146
- Well, you're not going alone.
- Oh, God!

18:02.148 --> 18:04.382
- I'm coming, too.
- No, no, you're staying.

18:04.384 --> 18:05.549
- Dad, come on.
- No.

18:05.551 --> 18:07.151
- Take him with you.
- Olivia.

18:07.153 --> 18:09.554
Just take him, Ray.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.590
Oh, Jesus Christ!

18:11.592 --> 18:14.026
Let me guess -
you're coming, too?

18:14.028 --> 18:16.594
I'm gonna feel left out
otherwise.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.664
Me too.

18:19.400 --> 18:21.703
A goddamn circus this is.

18:35.082 --> 18:37.352
You should talk to him.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.487
It doesn't matter what's going
on between you and Olivia, Ray.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.592
You need to talk to your son.

18:51.531 --> 18:54.199
Yeah, shit like that, Ray.

18:54.201 --> 18:57.602
- He'll end up hating you.
- My God, stop!

18:57.604 --> 19:00.671
Is he your son?

19:00.673 --> 19:02.576
No, he's mine.

19:03.644 --> 19:06.413
Sit back and shut up.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.651
I hate saying, "Told you so."

19:27.401 --> 19:29.668
Take advice from
my younger brother...

19:29.670 --> 19:30.735
All right...

19:30.737 --> 19:32.370
What life experience
do you have?

19:32.372 --> 19:35.306
- Let it go, guys, let it go.
- Huh?

19:35.308 --> 19:37.441
What life experience
do you have?

19:37.443 --> 19:39.210
I know what it's like
to not like your dad.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.746
You know what it's like
to raise a family?

19:41.748 --> 19:43.418
No.

19:44.317 --> 19:45.650
No, I don't.

19:45.652 --> 19:48.456
You couldn't raise
a loaf of bread.

20:02.635 --> 20:05.636
We're getting out? I didn't
bring appropriate footwear.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.639
There's a couple of flashlights
under your seat.

20:07.641 --> 20:10.909
I fail to see
how that's gonna help, Ray.

20:10.911 --> 20:12.611
Stay here with Noah.

20:12.613 --> 20:13.578
Ray!

20:13.580 --> 20:16.914
No problem, Ray.
I can do that for you, Ray.

20:16.916 --> 20:20.619
Thanks for asking
ever so kindly, Ray.

20:20.621 --> 20:23.591
Ray! Ray!
Will you slow down?

20:24.857 --> 20:26.391
What's with the weapon?

20:26.393 --> 20:28.860
- Ain't gonna use it, Ken.
- Besides the point.

20:28.862 --> 20:31.595
Look, if we run into these kids
out here messing around,

20:31.597 --> 20:35.600
you just let me do the talking,
right?

20:35.602 --> 20:38.702
So what do we do if the Mathison
boys run out in front of us?

20:38.704 --> 20:40.639
We chase after them.

20:40.641 --> 20:43.607
- What if they don't run?
- Catch 'em.

20:43.609 --> 20:46.911
- And then what?
- We beat 'em up.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.779
Ain't that a little barbaric?

20:48.781 --> 20:51.682
The Mathison Boys once asked me
to go play baseball with them

20:51.684 --> 20:54.553
in the reservoir when it
dried up a couple of years ago.

20:54.555 --> 20:57.322
They ended up tying me to a
fence post with a skipping rope

20:57.324 --> 21:00.327
using me for Spud Gun
target practice.

21:01.327 --> 21:03.394
OK.

21:03.396 --> 21:06.533
Well, then beat them up.

21:38.565 --> 21:41.501
I think we scared them off.

21:43.436 --> 21:45.505
They're gone.

21:48.541 --> 21:52.443
Look, I'll have a word
with Gregory Mathison myself

21:52.445 --> 21:54.814
in the next couple of days.

22:01.454 --> 22:02.789
Anyhow...

22:03.856 --> 22:05.356
We should head back.

22:05.358 --> 22:07.827
No point going any further, Ray.

22:10.931 --> 22:12.363
You all right?

22:12.365 --> 22:13.765
Yeah.

22:13.767 --> 22:16.801
- You look spooked.
- It's nothing.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.944
What the...

24:33.874 --> 24:35.543
Ah, crap!

26:09.970 --> 26:11.038
Uncle Morgan?

26:13.038 --> 26:14.538
Shit!

26:17.576 --> 26:19.145
- What was that light?
- You OK?

26:20.846 --> 26:22.148
Where's your uncle?

26:36.663 --> 26:38.028
Kenneth, come on.

26:38.030 --> 26:41.865
No! No, no, no...

26:41.867 --> 26:45.905
Kenneth! Kenneth, Kenneth!
What's going on?

26:48.040 --> 26:50.941
Morgan!

26:50.943 --> 26:53.611
It's me! It's me!
It's nothing! It's nothing!

26:53.613 --> 26:55.680
- Look at me!
- Billy!

26:55.682 --> 26:58.615
We gotta go! We gotta go!

26:58.617 --> 27:00.617
Come on!

27:00.619 --> 27:02.956
Morgan!

27:04.057 --> 27:06.026
Morgan!

27:07.027 --> 27:09.192
- What's happening?
- Move along.

27:09.194 --> 27:11.898
- what's wrong with him?
- Move!

27:14.768 --> 27:16.100
What's wrong with him?
Billy?

27:16.102 --> 27:18.702
Ray! Come on! Let's go!

27:18.704 --> 27:20.270
Ray!

27:20.272 --> 27:22.907
- You seen Morgan?
- What?

27:22.909 --> 27:26.080
- Morgan, your brother!
- He's not with you?

27:39.025 --> 27:41.228
Dad? What's wrong
with Uncle Kenneth?

28:10.123 --> 28:12.256
What am I doing?

28:14.094 --> 28:17.096
- Open the door!
- Oh, my God.

28:22.035 --> 28:24.369
What's wrong?
Oh, my God!

28:24.371 --> 28:25.803
What's happened?

28:25.805 --> 28:27.671
Honey, is he hurt?

28:27.673 --> 28:29.239
- Are you hurt?
- I don't know.

28:29.241 --> 28:30.908
Honey! Billy!

28:30.910 --> 28:32.075
What's wrong with you?

28:32.077 --> 28:34.112
Oh, my God, he looks terrible,
Billy. What's happened?

28:34.114 --> 28:36.748
- I don't know.
- Where is Morgan?

28:36.750 --> 28:37.981
Honey, speak to me!

28:37.983 --> 28:40.651
- Is Morgan here?
- Isn't he with you?

28:40.653 --> 28:43.187
No, he's, uh...

28:43.189 --> 28:45.757
- Dad!
- Ray!

28:45.759 --> 28:46.857
- Ray!
- Dad!

28:46.859 --> 28:49.826
Ray, what's...
what's going on?

28:49.828 --> 28:53.296
- Ray! Ray! Where is Morgan?
- What's happening?

28:53.298 --> 28:56.133
- I'll go look for him, OK?
- No, we shouldn't go outside.

28:56.135 --> 28:58.702
What are you so afraid of,
Billy?

28:58.704 --> 29:01.205
- Morgan's missing, Ray.
- Missing?

29:01.207 --> 29:03.141
No, no, he's not missing,
he's...

29:03.143 --> 29:05.176
He's probably lost
in the woods somewhere.

29:05.178 --> 29:07.978
- I'm calling the Sheriff.
- He's making his way back now.

29:07.980 --> 29:11.783
- I'm calling the Sheriff.
- Olivia, that's not gonna help!

29:11.785 --> 29:14.451
Olivia, stop!
That's not gonna help!

29:14.453 --> 29:16.187
Can I have the Sheriff, please?

29:16.189 --> 29:19.856
Sheriff? The police are sitting
in our front room right now!

29:19.858 --> 29:21.959
They're not exactly much use,
are they?

29:21.961 --> 29:25.028
- He needs a doctor, Ray.
- OK, look, let's...

29:25.030 --> 29:28.432
Let's just take a level
perspective and calm down, OK?

29:28.434 --> 29:30.468
Take a step back, OK?

29:30.470 --> 29:35.241
That's what too much TV and
not enough fruit does to you.

29:36.843 --> 29:39.443
OK, let's...

29:39.445 --> 29:42.880
You know, your imagination
works over sometimes,

29:42.882 --> 29:47.184
and you start thinking
about things, and...

29:47.186 --> 29:48.119
Look...

29:48.121 --> 29:50.353
Olivia, I'll find Morgan.

29:50.355 --> 29:52.159
I'll be right back.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.167
Morgan?

30:06.405 --> 30:08.142
Morgan!

30:14.380 --> 30:16.316
I don't...

30:22.521 --> 30:24.822
I don't know what I saw.

30:24.824 --> 30:26.125
Morgan?

30:29.394 --> 30:31.996
Goddamn, Morgan.

30:31.998 --> 30:34.234
Come on, buddy.

30:38.805 --> 30:40.470
Morgan!

30:47.279 --> 30:49.316
Something's happening...

31:08.134 --> 31:10.269
Something unnatural.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.293
Something evil.

35:40.672 --> 35:42.408
Ugh!

36:03.128 --> 36:04.498
Noah!

37:06.759 --> 37:10.327
- Is everyone OK?
- What the hell was that?

37:17.670 --> 37:19.739
Billy.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.180
Hey, boy.

37:30.182 --> 37:32.782
What did you see?

37:32.784 --> 37:35.321
What is it, boy?

38:01.847 --> 38:03.817
Ray! Don't!

38:57.836 --> 38:59.672
Noah!

39:01.373 --> 39:03.509
Stay back, son.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.680
Morgan?

39:09.681 --> 39:12.418
Is that you, buddy?

39:16.822 --> 39:18.758
Is anyone there?

39:21.893 --> 39:23.829
I swear to God...

39:25.063 --> 39:26.863
We're not messing around
in here.

39:26.865 --> 39:29.532
Did you hear that?

39:29.534 --> 39:31.704
We got guns.

40:31.831 --> 40:33.932
Shh!

42:14.233 --> 42:17.036
They're in the basement.

45:30.228 --> 45:31.096
Ray?

45:33.699 --> 45:35.168
Ray?

45:37.402 --> 45:38.870
Ray!

45:55.019 --> 45:58.287
- Kenneth!
- Where's Ray?

45:58.289 --> 46:00.159
The light!

46:01.226 --> 46:02.894
- Olivia!
- Ray!

47:00.452 --> 47:02.288
Don't!

47:13.931 --> 47:16.532
What was that?

47:16.534 --> 47:18.336
The attic hatch.

47:49.934 --> 47:52.404
- Keys!
- Ray!

47:53.572 --> 47:55.907
Arlene!

47:58.242 --> 47:59.943
Ray!

47:59.945 --> 48:01.978
Come on!

48:01.980 --> 48:03.213
Fuck!

48:03.215 --> 48:05.315
All right, Ray,
where's the ammo?

48:05.317 --> 48:08.153
No, no ammo! Go!

48:40.853 --> 48:43.322
Hey! Hey!

48:44.556 --> 48:46.555
Yeah.

48:46.557 --> 48:48.960
Help us!

48:52.597 --> 48:54.396
Hey! No, no, no...

48:54.398 --> 48:56.566
Hey! Hey!

48:56.568 --> 48:58.001
Hey, help us!

48:58.003 --> 49:00.972
Oh, come on! Come on!

49:02.641 --> 49:05.344
Chickenshits!

49:06.545 --> 49:09.014
They took Maisie,
didn't they?

49:21.425 --> 49:24.059
They turned around
and went the other way.

49:24.061 --> 49:26.097
You were running at them
with an axe.

49:42.581 --> 49:44.083
Mom...

49:45.217 --> 49:47.052
The stars are moving...

52:24.141 --> 52:26.745
Billy, do you want
to put that thing down?

52:40.324 --> 52:43.258
We received a phone call
not an hour ago.

52:43.260 --> 52:45.695
The call came from your place.

52:45.697 --> 52:48.363
Denise said that she believed
the woman she spoke to

52:48.365 --> 52:50.402
was you asking for me.

52:51.402 --> 52:53.570
Then the call got cut off
by the storm.

52:53.572 --> 52:56.472
Mind telling me
what that was about?

52:56.474 --> 52:58.575
I'm also hoping it'll explain
why the three of you

52:58.577 --> 53:00.642
are out in both the middle
of the night and nowhere

53:00.644 --> 53:03.345
looking like hell...
with an axe.

53:03.347 --> 53:06.249
Some people terrorized us.

53:06.251 --> 53:08.217
They invaded our home
and, uh...

53:08.219 --> 53:12.655
Ray, his brother Morgan,
my sister Arlene

53:12.657 --> 53:14.593
and Kenneth.

53:15.559 --> 53:17.327
- They're missing.
- Kenneth?

53:17.329 --> 53:19.295
As in Deputy Sheriff Burroughs?

53:19.297 --> 53:22.164
And our dog.

53:22.166 --> 53:23.733
Missing?

53:23.735 --> 53:26.336
They were taken.

53:26.338 --> 53:29.542
How many perps?
What are we dealing with here?

53:30.809 --> 53:32.675
We don't know.

53:32.677 --> 53:34.844
- We never saw them.
- A group.

53:34.846 --> 53:37.380
A small group.
Maybe three.

53:37.382 --> 53:38.751
Uh, three or four.

53:43.822 --> 53:45.557
OK.
Jump in.

54:06.811 --> 54:08.811
OK, folks.
Stay here.

54:08.813 --> 54:10.583
We'll go check it out.

55:29.594 --> 55:31.597
Power's still out.

55:32.831 --> 55:35.467
Which means they're still here.

56:38.463 --> 56:40.966
Well, whoever was here
ain't anymore.

56:46.670 --> 56:49.875
It doesn't look like
they were robbed neither.

56:52.911 --> 56:55.912
We should check the fuse box,
get the power back up.

56:55.914 --> 56:58.450
The storm, most likely.

57:03.722 --> 57:06.625
Five shots were fired
in the hall.

57:41.525 --> 57:43.061
Huh!

57:44.963 --> 57:48.834
It just all seems a little vague
for my liking.

57:55.005 --> 57:57.940
Well, they don't need
the attention.

57:57.942 --> 58:00.679
Specially not today.

58:06.518 --> 58:09.788
Something definitely
happened here tonight.

58:10.889 --> 58:14.023
We just need to get
to the bottom of it,

58:14.025 --> 58:17.894
but before any of that's
even remotely possible,

58:17.896 --> 58:19.998
I need to get me
a damn strong coffee.

58:29.106 --> 58:31.974
It certainly is bizarre.

58:31.976 --> 58:35.077
It's incredibly hard to imagine
that four adults...

58:35.079 --> 58:37.079
...and a dog!

58:37.081 --> 58:38.981
...four adults and a dog

58:38.983 --> 58:41.954
simply vanished
in the course of an hour.

58:43.153 --> 58:46.088
Look...

58:46.090 --> 58:51.059
The fact is, neither one of you
actually saw the perps.

58:51.061 --> 58:52.961
I'm telling you what happened.

58:52.963 --> 58:56.132
And I believe you, Olivia.
I really do. Every word.

58:56.134 --> 58:59.068
But my job is to make sense
of this situation,

58:59.070 --> 59:03.108
and this is a hard one to grasp.
Please understand that.

59:15.052 --> 59:17.887
We insist you come back
to the station with us.

59:17.889 --> 59:20.057
You can get some rest there
and some food.

59:22.092 --> 59:23.258
I'm staying.

59:23.260 --> 59:26.164
- Me too.
- We're not going anywhere.

59:30.902 --> 59:35.104
OK. Well, uh... We'll be back
in an hour with some officials

59:35.106 --> 59:38.039
who'll be able to actually
do something about this.

59:38.041 --> 59:39.809
In the meantime,

59:39.811 --> 59:41.744
I suggest you get some rest.

59:41.746 --> 59:43.079
I'll be parked outside on watch

59:43.081 --> 59:45.014
after I take the Sheriff
to the station, OK?

59:45.016 --> 59:48.854
If anything happens, anything
at all, you go straight to him.

59:57.061 --> 59:58.961
Olivia, I'm concerned.

59:58.963 --> 01:00:02.164
If any of this gets out,
any of it,

01:00:02.166 --> 01:00:06.068
it may have a hugely negative
effect on Maisie's case.

01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:08.006
What case?

01:00:10.108 --> 01:00:14.010
Look, I don't think this is what
people can know about right now,

01:00:14.012 --> 01:00:16.979
not for you
or your family's sake.

01:00:16.981 --> 01:00:19.715
Not the lights in the sky,
the disappearances,

01:00:19.717 --> 01:00:22.885
Ray, your sister, nothing.

01:00:22.887 --> 01:00:24.686
I'm going to keep it quiet,

01:00:24.688 --> 01:00:26.958
and I highly recommend
you do the same.

01:00:28.726 --> 01:00:29.994
Please.

01:00:33.864 --> 01:00:35.998
We'll figure this out.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.802
OK?

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:41.806
Now get some rest.

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:51.139
Now, is it just me
or is it one of those mornings?

01:01:51.141 --> 01:01:53.978
I've never had
a morning like this.

01:02:07.291 --> 01:02:09.057
I don't wanna ask, Doyle.

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:11.827
Power failure, crop vandalism,
lights in the sky,

01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:13.329
phone's been ringing
off the hook.

01:02:13.331 --> 01:02:15.063
Madness of the crowds.

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:18.971
Well, as a matter of fact, I'd
like to make a report myself.

01:02:23.173 --> 01:02:26.878
Contain everyone.
Get them all inside.

01:02:28.278 --> 01:02:31.083
What the hell's going on?

01:02:32.784 --> 01:02:34.251
Lights.

01:02:35.152 --> 01:02:37.720
In the sky. Uh...

01:02:37.722 --> 01:02:39.688
Fast.

01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:42.191
Non-ballistic.

01:02:42.193 --> 01:02:46.195
And then there was
this uh... other light.

01:02:46.197 --> 01:02:50.836
It was, uh... It was different.
It was bright.

01:02:51.802 --> 01:02:53.304
Within that light, I uh...

01:02:56.239 --> 01:02:58.142
I... I saw...

01:02:59.210 --> 01:03:00.912
Who?

01:03:02.246 --> 01:03:04.282
Who did you see?

01:03:08.452 --> 01:03:10.889
Maisie Anderson.

01:04:51.422 --> 01:04:53.889
Hey, boy.

01:04:53.891 --> 01:04:56.191
Oh, my God, Genghis! Hey!

01:04:56.193 --> 01:04:58.130
How have you been?

01:05:05.536 --> 01:05:10.039
Good boy! Good boy! Mm!

01:05:10.041 --> 01:05:13.976
Are the others here, huh?
Did you find the others?

01:05:13.978 --> 01:05:16.014
Huh?

01:05:31.896 --> 01:05:33.498
They're still here.

01:10:01.332 --> 01:10:03.264
'Ray, ready?

01:10:03.266 --> 01:10:05.235
'Go!'

01:10:12.176 --> 01:10:13.541
- 'Hey!'
- 'Hey!'

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:15.544
'What do you have planned
for this evening?'

01:10:15.546 --> 01:10:16.745
'I don't know.'

01:10:16.747 --> 01:10:18.679
'You have
the house to yourself.'

01:10:18.681 --> 01:10:20.682
'I might watch TV.'

01:10:20.684 --> 01:10:23.451
'Let me take a look
at that picture.

01:10:23.453 --> 01:10:25.521
'Is that supposed to be me?'

01:10:25.523 --> 01:10:27.522
- 'Yeah.'
- 'Oh.

01:10:27.524 --> 01:10:29.191
'I look kinda ugly.

01:10:29.193 --> 01:10:31.660
'Is that how you portray
your old man?

01:10:31.662 --> 01:10:33.661
'Make me look like a bear?'

01:10:33.663 --> 01:10:36.568
'We're leaving now, Maisie.
Love you.'

01:10:42.206 --> 01:10:44.205
'Are my keys downstairs?'

01:10:44.207 --> 01:10:47.276
- 'Yep!'
- 'All right.

01:10:47.278 --> 01:10:48.744
'Love you, too, sweetheart!

01:10:48.746 --> 01:10:52.283
'Won't be long,
just a couple of hours!

01:10:54.284 --> 01:10:56.250
- 'She does not care.'
- 'She's not listening.'

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:58.786
'No. She's like,
"Leave! Get out!"'

01:10:58.788 --> 01:11:00.488
'Is she writing?'

01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:03.825
'Yeah. And she's
really involved.'

01:11:03.827 --> 01:11:06.597
- 'Did you read it?'
- 'No.'

01:11:40.730 --> 01:11:42.766
Maisie!

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:45.836
Maisie!

01:11:46.737 --> 01:11:48.806
Maisie!

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:04.753
No, Maisie!

01:12:04.755 --> 01:12:06.821
Maisie! Maisie, stop!

01:12:06.823 --> 01:12:10.794
Don't answer the door!
Don't answer the door, Maisie!

01:13:42.519 --> 01:13:44.889
- 'How are you?'
- 'Good.'

01:14:05.943 --> 01:14:08.744
Hey, Genghis,
howya' doing, fella?

01:14:08.746 --> 01:14:10.745
- Hey!
- Want a lemonade?

01:14:10.747 --> 01:14:12.880
Uh, no thanks.
I'm still on duty.

01:14:12.882 --> 01:14:14.849
Just came by
to see how you all are.

01:14:14.851 --> 01:14:17.753
Mom and Dad have gone into town.
They'll be a couple of hours.

01:14:17.755 --> 01:14:19.388
Oh.
Oh, that's fine.

01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:21.022
You can wait here for them
if you like.

01:14:21.024 --> 01:14:22.960
They won't be long.

01:14:27.765 --> 01:14:29.630
Noah's staying at Parker's!

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:31.566
Is Parker a friend?

01:14:31.568 --> 01:14:33.835
Yeah, from school!

01:14:33.837 --> 01:14:35.073
Right.

01:14:37.173 --> 01:14:39.174
- How's Aunt Arlene?
- Uh...

01:14:39.176 --> 01:14:40.878
She's good.

01:14:41.979 --> 01:14:43.815
She says hi.

01:14:55.458 --> 01:14:57.961
You never said you were here.

01:16:07.564 --> 01:16:09.967
What are you doing?

01:21:00.791 --> 01:21:02.025
Mom?

01:23:41.984 --> 01:23:44.451
Who are you?

01:23:50.961 --> 01:23:54.365
Let go of me!

01:24:22.091 --> 01:24:24.494
Where is she?

01:27:06.823 --> 01:27:08.388
'Kenneth!'

01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:10.460
No, no, no, no...

01:29:17.686 --> 01:29:19.689
'In my mind...

01:29:21.056 --> 01:29:23.924
'they must have known
of her existence

01:29:23.926 --> 01:29:26.294
'and visited her.

01:29:26.296 --> 01:29:27.794
'Then she disappeared.

01:29:27.796 --> 01:29:31.968
'I guess they must have,
uhm... waited.

01:29:34.770 --> 01:29:38.938
'waited for us to, uh,
figure it out for ourselves

01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:41.644
'before they intervened.'

01:29:44.346 --> 01:29:46.617
'To help us.

01:29:51.621 --> 01:29:53.890
'To show us.'

01:29:59.095 --> 01:30:01.597
'But honestly, we, uh...

01:30:02.664 --> 01:30:04.667
'We don't know.

01:30:05.868 --> 01:30:08.772
'I'm guessing
we'll never truly know.'

01:30:24.886 --> 01:30:27.990
'And now
I can put Maisie to rest.

01:30:32.127 --> 01:30:36.565
'Thanks to these... visitors.

01:30:38.967 --> 01:30:41.938
'These angels.'
