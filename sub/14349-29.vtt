00:17.133 --> 00:18.134
Anything,
lieutenant?

00:18.134 --> 00:19.135
No, sir.

00:19.135 --> 00:21.637
I've tried every major
transmitting station on Deneva.

00:21.638 --> 00:24.140
None of them have acknowledged
my contact signal.

00:24.140 --> 00:27.643
Try GSK-783,
subspace frequency three.

00:27.644 --> 00:30.146
But, sir, that's a call sign
for a private transmitter.

00:30.146 --> 00:32.648
I'm very well aware of that,
lieutenant. Try it.

00:32.649 --> 00:33.650
Yes, sir.

00:33.650 --> 00:35.652
Evaluation,
Mr. Spock.

00:35.652 --> 00:37.153
As I speculated,
captain,

00:37.153 --> 00:39.155
the overall pattern
of mass insanity

00:39.155 --> 00:43.742
destroying civilizations
follows an almost straight line

00:43.743 --> 00:45.327
through this section
of the galaxy.

00:45.328 --> 00:47.330
Over here,
the Beta Portolan system,

00:47.330 --> 00:49.332
the ancient civilizations.

00:49.332 --> 00:51.834
Archaeologists have given us
information indicating

00:51.835 --> 00:53.837
that they were
the beginning.

00:53.837 --> 00:54.871
Two hundred years ago,

00:54.871 --> 00:58.457
Lavinius V was swept
by mass insanity.

00:58.458 --> 01:00.460
Then Theta Cygni XII.

01:00.460 --> 01:03.963
The last was Ingraham B,
two years ago.

01:03.963 --> 01:06.932
And next in line,
Deneva.

01:06.933 --> 01:10.553
Bones, what's your theory
about the cause of all this?

01:10.553 --> 01:12.638
There is no medical
or scientific cause

01:12.639 --> 01:14.474
for what happened
on those planets, Jim.

01:14.474 --> 01:16.058
But it follows
a definite pattern,

01:16.059 --> 01:18.728
a systematic progression
from planet...

01:18.728 --> 01:19.729
to planet.

01:19.729 --> 01:21.280
Captain.

01:21.281 --> 01:22.815
We're picking up a ship
on our sensors,

01:22.816 --> 01:24.617
heading directly into
the Denevan sun.

01:24.617 --> 01:26.118
He'll burn up.

01:26.119 --> 01:28.121
Plot an interception course,
Mr. Sulu, warp factor 8.

01:28.121 --> 01:30.123
Lieutenant Uhura,
try to contact that ship.

01:30.123 --> 01:31.124
Aye, aye, sir.

01:37.213 --> 01:40.299
The ship is a one-man vessel of
Denevan configuration, captain.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.302
He does not seem to be
out of control.

01:42.302 --> 01:43.920
His course is straight
for the sun.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.338
Scotty, tractor beam?

01:46.639 --> 01:47.556
Out of range, sir.

01:52.562 --> 01:55.147
Making contact, captain.

01:55.148 --> 01:57.650
Denevan ship,
this is the USS Enterprise.

01:57.650 --> 01:59.234
Can you reverse your course?

01:59.235 --> 02:00.569
Acknowledge.

02:08.945 --> 02:10.579
Captain, we'll get
too close to the sun.

02:10.580 --> 02:11.447
Keep closing.

02:12.782 --> 02:15.284
Denevan ship,
reverse your course.

02:19.756 --> 02:21.040
Do you hear me?

02:21.040 --> 02:22.624
Reverse
your course.

02:22.625 --> 02:24.126
Acknowledge.

02:26.880 --> 02:30.800
Outer hull temperature,
now 480 degrees and rising.

02:36.856 --> 02:38.023
He's too close, captain.

02:38.024 --> 02:39.108
So are we.

02:39.108 --> 02:41.610
Hull temperature
1,000 degrees and rising.

02:41.611 --> 02:43.312
Sun's gravimetric pull
increasing.

02:47.233 --> 02:48.701
I did it.

02:48.701 --> 02:50.652
It's finally gone! I'm free.

02:52.121 --> 02:52.988
I'm..

02:54.207 --> 02:55.541
He burned up, captain.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.796
Reverse course,
180 degrees about.

02:59.796 --> 03:00.830
Aye, sir.

03:14.344 --> 03:17.096
All clear, captain.
Hull temperature falling.

03:17.096 --> 03:19.681
Gravimetric pull approaching
tolerance level.

03:19.682 --> 03:21.183
Very well.

03:21.184 --> 03:24.187
Reduce to
sub-warp speed.

03:24.187 --> 03:26.189
Take us to Deneva.

03:26.189 --> 03:27.190
Aye, aye, sir.

03:28.691 --> 03:31.694
That Denevan ship headed
deliberately into the sun.

03:31.694 --> 03:32.695
Why?

03:32.695 --> 03:34.697
There's one
possibility.

03:34.697 --> 03:37.700
The mass insanity may have
reached this planet too.

03:37.700 --> 03:39.702
Captain,
I'm having difficulty

03:39.702 --> 03:41.203
on that transmitter call
to Deneva.

03:41.204 --> 03:42.205
Keep trying.

03:42.205 --> 03:43.706
Yes, sir.

03:47.210 --> 03:50.713
Jim, your brother, Sam,
his family,

03:50.713 --> 03:53.215
aren't they stationed
on this planet?

04:04.727 --> 04:09.231
Space, the final frontier.

04:09.232 --> 04:12.735
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

04:12.735 --> 04:17.623
Its five-year mission:
to explore strange new worlds,

04:17.624 --> 04:20.793
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

04:20.793 --> 04:25.214
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

04:59.115 --> 05:04.120
Captain's log, stardate 3287.2.

05:04.120 --> 05:05.921
The mass insanity

05:05.922 --> 05:08.507
we have tracked across
this section of the galaxy

05:08.508 --> 05:11.010
seems to have
already touched Deneva.

05:11.010 --> 05:13.512
That planet,
colonized over a century ago,

05:13.513 --> 05:15.515
is one of the most beautiful
in the galaxy.

05:15.515 --> 05:18.017
Planet development
is normal, captain.

05:18.017 --> 05:20.019
Originally colonized
as a freighting line base

05:20.019 --> 05:21.020
in this area.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.022
Aye, they make
regular trips from here,

05:23.022 --> 05:25.524
carrying supplies to the
asteroid belt for the miners

05:25.525 --> 05:27.527
and bringing
cargo out.

05:27.527 --> 05:29.445
I've made the run
a couple of times myself

05:29.445 --> 05:31.029
as an engineering
advisor.

05:31.030 --> 05:34.533
No Federation contacts
for over a year.

05:34.534 --> 05:36.035
Captain.

05:38.538 --> 05:41.040
I've made contact with
your private transmitter, sir.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.541
Put it on audio.

05:43.743 --> 05:46.328
Please hurry. Help us.

05:46.329 --> 05:48.331
I don't have much time.
They'll know.

05:48.331 --> 05:49.832
Please! Please..

05:49.832 --> 05:52.835
Aurelan. This is Jim
on the Enterprise.

05:52.835 --> 05:54.336
Repeat your message.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.675
Contact broken,
sir.

05:59.675 --> 06:00.676
Re-establish.

06:02.678 --> 06:04.179
I'm sorry, sir.

06:04.180 --> 06:06.265
I'm not interested
in your excuses, lieutenant.

06:06.265 --> 06:08.350
Re-establish contact
with that transmitter.

06:08.351 --> 06:11.821
I'm afraid that's impossible
at the moment, captain.

06:11.821 --> 06:13.522
They stopped broadcasting
immediately.

06:13.523 --> 06:16.442
They do not acknowledge
my contact signal.

06:16.442 --> 06:17.526
Keep trying to
raise them.

06:17.527 --> 06:18.528
Yes, sir.

06:18.528 --> 06:19.529
Jim.

06:21.030 --> 06:22.781
Did you know who
that woman was?

06:22.782 --> 06:23.866
Yes.

06:24.867 --> 06:27.369
You were right
a while back.

06:27.370 --> 06:28.838
My brother, Sam,
lives on Deneva.

06:28.838 --> 06:30.873
He's a research
biologist.

06:30.873 --> 06:33.375
That woman...

06:33.376 --> 06:35.878
It sounded like his wife,
Aurelan.

06:46.722 --> 06:47.806
Set your phasers
on stun.

06:47.807 --> 06:49.809
We're going to beam directly
into the capital city.

06:49.809 --> 06:51.310
Alert status.

06:51.310 --> 06:52.311
Mr. Spock?

06:53.813 --> 06:57.616
Lieutenant Uhura has had no
further response to our signals.

06:57.617 --> 06:59.201
Sensors report
the expected number

06:59.202 --> 07:00.703
of humans on the planet surface.

07:00.703 --> 07:03.038
However,
they are strangely quiet,

07:03.039 --> 07:05.124
very little
activity.

07:08.294 --> 07:09.795
I'll want
a complete transcript

07:09.796 --> 07:11.798
of everything that happens
down there.

07:11.798 --> 07:12.298
Yes, sir.
Let's go.

07:18.304 --> 07:19.305
Energize.

08:04.183 --> 08:06.685
There are almost a million
inhabitants of Deneva.

08:06.686 --> 08:08.187
There's more than 100,000
in this city alone.

08:08.187 --> 08:09.771
Where is everyone?

08:09.772 --> 08:11.857
They're here, captain.
In the buildings.

08:12.859 --> 08:14.360
Strangely quiescent.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.728
My brother's lab
is over there.

08:17.947 --> 08:20.032
They signaled us once.

08:20.032 --> 08:22.534
There should be someone there.

08:22.535 --> 08:24.119
Let's find out
what's happening.

08:27.573 --> 08:28.574
Back! Go away!

08:28.574 --> 08:29.491
Captain,

08:29.492 --> 08:30.576
several people approaching.

08:32.078 --> 08:34.663
Go back! Run, get away! We don't want to hurt you!

08:34.664 --> 08:36.215
Go back!
Beat it!

08:36.215 --> 08:38.467
Go back!
Get out of here, please!

08:38.467 --> 08:39.717
Run! Get away!

08:39.719 --> 08:42.421
Go away! Get out of here now!
Get away!

08:42.421 --> 08:45.891
Run! Get away!
We don't want to hurt you!

08:45.892 --> 08:46.976
Stand by to fire.

08:47.810 --> 08:48.894
Fire!

08:56.936 --> 08:58.938
Did you hear
what they said, Mr. Spock?

08:58.938 --> 09:01.440
Indeed, they seemed
most concerned for our safety.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.742
They tried to brain us
with these clubs.

09:03.743 --> 09:05.327
Check them out, Bones.

09:05.328 --> 09:08.331
Their attitude was inconsistent
with their actions.

09:08.331 --> 09:09.332
To say the least.

09:10.616 --> 09:11.700
There's something
wrong, Jim.

09:11.701 --> 09:13.703
Their nervous systems...

09:13.703 --> 09:15.705
unconscious like this,
there should be

09:15.705 --> 09:17.456
just routine
autonomic activity.

09:17.456 --> 09:19.624
But I'm getting
a very high reading,

09:19.625 --> 09:21.627
as though, even in
their unconscious state,

09:21.627 --> 09:23.845
they're being
violently stimulated.

09:25.431 --> 09:27.049
Fan out.
Follow me.

09:32.638 --> 09:34.139
Security.

09:36.359 --> 09:38.861
They're here!
They're here!

09:38.861 --> 09:40.863
Please,
keep them away!

09:45.868 --> 09:46.869
They're here!

09:46.869 --> 09:47.870
Aurelan,
it's Jim.

09:47.870 --> 09:49.371
They're here!

09:49.372 --> 09:50.873
It's Jim, Aurelan.
Bones.

09:58.965 --> 10:00.466
Aurelan...

10:00.466 --> 10:02.968
you're safe now.

10:02.969 --> 10:04.470
Is this your brother, Jim?

10:20.236 --> 10:21.737
Oh...

10:22.738 --> 10:24.239
Sam.

10:27.743 --> 10:29.745
It is my brother.

10:30.746 --> 10:32.247
Was my brother.

10:34.250 --> 10:36.752
I'm sorry, Jim.

10:36.752 --> 10:39.755
The boy's unconscious,
but he's still alive.

10:41.874 --> 10:42.958
Peter.

10:50.099 --> 10:53.218
I'd better get the boy and the
mother back to the ship, Jim.

10:53.219 --> 10:55.187
I can't do much for them
down here.

10:57.139 --> 10:58.890
Get ready to beam up.

11:03.195 --> 11:04.696
McCoy
to Enterprise.

11:06.198 --> 11:08.700
Prepare to beam up
party of four.

11:14.290 --> 11:17.326
Captain, I understand
how you..

11:17.326 --> 11:18.910
Yes.

11:18.911 --> 11:20.412
Yes, Mr. Spock.

11:21.914 --> 11:23.916
You heard my sister-in-law
say something

11:23.916 --> 11:25.801
about "they" being here.
Your guess.

11:27.169 --> 11:28.720
Notice the ventilator,
captain.

11:28.721 --> 11:31.006
Apparently, they were
trying to keep

11:31.006 --> 11:32.090
something outside
from getting in.

11:32.091 --> 11:34.093
Obviously, they were not
entirely successful.

11:34.093 --> 11:35.094
That doesn't
make sense.

11:35.094 --> 11:37.096
There are no
harmful life forms reported.

11:37.096 --> 11:38.597
Our sensors didn't
pick up anything

11:38.597 --> 11:40.098
that didn't belong here.

11:40.099 --> 11:43.102
That is correct.
I am at a loss to understand it.

11:43.102 --> 11:45.604
Ready to beam up,
captain.

11:45.604 --> 11:46.821
I'd like you to
be onboard

11:46.822 --> 11:48.907
when your sister-in-law
regains consciousness.

11:50.409 --> 11:52.911
Take charge of
the landing party, Mr. Spock.

11:52.912 --> 11:54.613
I want some answers
to all this.

12:03.956 --> 12:05.958
I won't be able to give you
the exact cause

12:05.958 --> 12:07.960
until I get the plates
back from the lab.

12:07.960 --> 12:11.463
They're both in extreme pain.
I've sedated them heavily.

12:11.464 --> 12:14.467
But your sister-in-law seems
to have a high tolerance.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.470
The tranquilizer hasn't
affected her much.

12:17.470 --> 12:18.471
Can she talk?

12:18.471 --> 12:19.939
Yes.

12:32.902 --> 12:34.403
Aurelan.

12:36.405 --> 12:38.907
Aurelan, it's Jim.

12:40.910 --> 12:42.411
Jim?

12:43.913 --> 12:45.915
Sam. He's...

12:45.915 --> 12:46.916
He's dead.

12:51.837 --> 12:53.138
But your son's still alive.

12:58.677 --> 12:59.978
You've got to help us.

13:01.730 --> 13:03.732
You are here.

13:05.234 --> 13:06.602
It is you, Jim.

13:08.103 --> 13:09.437
Yes, I'm here.

13:13.275 --> 13:15.777
You have to tell us
what happened, Aurelan,

13:15.778 --> 13:17.196
to you and
the others.

13:20.199 --> 13:21.700
They came...

13:23.169 --> 13:24.703
eight months ago.

13:25.754 --> 13:27.088
Who?

13:27.923 --> 13:29.424
Things.

13:29.425 --> 13:32.511
Horrible things!

13:32.511 --> 13:37.632
Visitors brought them
in their vessel from a planet...

13:37.633 --> 13:39.101
Ingraham B.

13:40.052 --> 13:43.055
What kind of things?

13:43.055 --> 13:46.058
Not the ship's
crew's fault.

13:46.058 --> 13:49.561
The things made them
bring their ship here.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.063
Aurelan...

13:51.063 --> 13:55.200
it's important that you
tell us what kind of things.

13:55.201 --> 13:57.820
Not their fault.

14:15.588 --> 14:19.174
When she answers questions,
any questions,

14:19.174 --> 14:21.643
it's as if she's fighting
to get the answers out.

14:23.095 --> 14:25.564
As though something
is exerting pain to stop her.

14:26.982 --> 14:29.484
They use it to control us.

14:30.936 --> 14:32.938
They're spreading, Jim.

14:33.939 --> 14:36.908
They need us to be
their arms and legs.

14:38.360 --> 14:41.863
They're forcing us
to build ships for them.

14:43.866 --> 14:46.869
Don't let them!

14:46.869 --> 14:51.373
Don't let them
go any further!

15:34.800 --> 15:35.750
My brother's son...

15:38.671 --> 15:41.473
I'll do everything I can,
Jim, to save him.

16:08.617 --> 16:10.118
Report.

16:10.119 --> 16:11.954
The streets are
extraordinarily quiet, Jim.

16:11.954 --> 16:13.538
We've seen
no other Denevans,

16:13.539 --> 16:17.593
and the ones we stunned earlier
were gone when we came out.

16:17.593 --> 16:23.599
You've seen some kind of
creature, any alien form?

16:23.599 --> 16:25.467
None, sir. There's just
that noise we heard.

16:25.467 --> 16:27.469
A peculiar
buzzing sound.

16:27.469 --> 16:29.971
We were about to
investigate it.

16:29.972 --> 16:31.974
All right.

16:31.974 --> 16:33.976
Let's go find out
what it is.

16:33.976 --> 16:36.979
Set your phasers on
force 3, to kill.

16:36.979 --> 16:39.982
We're looking for
some kind of creature.

16:40.983 --> 16:43.485
And we already know
it will kill.

17:15.017 --> 17:16.518
Spock!

17:20.521 --> 17:22.022
Form a ring.

17:27.863 --> 17:28.947
Fire!

17:49.301 --> 17:51.553
Incredible.

17:51.553 --> 17:53.638
Not only should it have been
destroyed by our phasers,

17:53.639 --> 17:55.390
it does not even register
on my tricorder.

17:55.390 --> 17:58.943
Captain, it doesn't
even look real.

17:58.944 --> 18:00.812
It is not life
as we know or understand it.

18:01.647 --> 18:04.149
Yet it is obviously alive,
it exists.

18:04.149 --> 18:07.952
And it can bear up
under full phaser power.

18:07.953 --> 18:09.821
Captain, I suggest
we risk taking it aboard.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.156
It's too closed in here.

18:11.156 --> 18:12.073
It may be a trap.
Let's move out.

18:22.968 --> 18:24.970
Spock.

18:24.970 --> 18:25.971
Spock!

18:35.981 --> 18:38.984
It's gone.
Can you stand?

18:38.984 --> 18:40.318
Spock, are you
all right?

18:52.364 --> 18:54.949
Captain's log, supplemental.

18:54.950 --> 18:56.418
Whatever the creatures are,

18:56.418 --> 19:00.121
they have apparently taken over
all the inhabitants of Deneva.

19:00.122 --> 19:02.457
Meanwhile,
ship surgeon Dr. McCoy

19:02.457 --> 19:04.675
is examining
a strange puncture wound

19:04.676 --> 19:07.679
left by one of the creatures
on Mr. Spock's back.

19:08.680 --> 19:09.681
Nurse.

19:11.683 --> 19:13.685
That's the second time
he's come out of it.

19:13.685 --> 19:15.019
Either he's
fighting us...

19:16.605 --> 19:19.557
or something inside of him
is fighting us.

19:24.897 --> 19:27.399
Doctor, the readings have
never looked like that before,

19:27.399 --> 19:28.316
not even on Mr. Spock.

19:38.660 --> 19:40.078
Let's prepare to close.

19:45.634 --> 19:46.418
Nurse!

19:49.254 --> 19:51.506
Doctor, that's not
all you're going to do?

19:51.506 --> 19:52.673
Miss Chapel!

19:52.674 --> 19:53.758
Doctor, there is more
of it in him,

19:53.759 --> 19:55.427
entwined all through
his body.

19:55.427 --> 19:57.512
Miss Chapel, if you cannot
assist me as required,

19:57.512 --> 19:59.013
call another nurse in here.

19:59.014 --> 20:00.398
But do one or the other now.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.832
How is he?

20:16.832 --> 20:18.834
To be very frank, Jim, I don't
know that I can do anything

20:18.834 --> 20:20.836
for Spock
or your nephew.

20:22.337 --> 20:25.340
Pieces of some form
of living tissue.

20:25.340 --> 20:27.842
I removed one
from Spock's spinal cord,

20:27.843 --> 20:29.344
the other from your
sister-in-law's body.

20:29.344 --> 20:30.845
They're both the same.

20:30.846 --> 20:32.848
The boy's far
too weak to touch.

20:32.848 --> 20:34.349
Besides, the removal
of the tissue

20:34.349 --> 20:37.852
wouldn't stop the pain anyhow,
as far as I can tell.

20:37.853 --> 20:39.354
Did you operate
on Spock in time?

20:39.354 --> 20:42.357
No, no, no. I just removed
these for examination.

20:42.357 --> 20:43.858
His body's full
of these tentacles,

20:43.859 --> 20:46.444
entwining and growing
all about his nervous system.

20:49.448 --> 20:50.282
My nephew?

20:52.067 --> 20:52.901
The same.

20:55.454 --> 20:57.456
Evidently,
when the creature attacks,

20:57.456 --> 21:01.042
it leaves a stinger,
much like a bee or a wasp,

21:01.043 --> 21:04.046
leaving one of these
in the victim's body.

21:04.046 --> 21:06.581
And it takes over
the victim very rapidly.

21:06.581 --> 21:10.084
And the entwining is far,
far too involved

21:10.085 --> 21:11.836
for conventional surgery
to remove.

21:12.838 --> 21:13.839
Recommendations?

21:14.840 --> 21:16.341
I'm sorry, Jim.

21:16.341 --> 21:18.843
The lab, the science
departments...

21:19.845 --> 21:21.313
we're all stumped.

21:26.735 --> 21:28.236
No.

21:30.739 --> 21:31.740
No.

21:34.743 --> 21:35.744
Mr. Spock.

21:36.695 --> 21:38.246
No, I won't..

21:41.249 --> 21:42.750
Mr. Spock..

21:44.870 --> 21:46.872
Bridge,
this is Sickbay.

21:46.872 --> 21:49.341
Tell Dr. McCoy
Mr. Spock just left here.

21:49.341 --> 21:50.925
He's delirious,
possibly dangerous.

21:50.926 --> 21:52.928
All decks, security alert.

21:52.928 --> 21:55.430
Locate and restrain Mr. Spock.
He may be dangerous.

21:55.430 --> 21:58.850
Use phasers, on stun,
if necessary.

22:01.436 --> 22:02.437
Must take ship!

22:02.437 --> 22:03.438
Spock..

22:26.461 --> 22:28.296
I must...

22:30.165 --> 22:31.749
take it down...

22:42.060 --> 22:43.561
Get him back
to the Sickbay.

22:43.562 --> 22:45.564
Use security restraints.

22:51.103 --> 22:54.606
The K-3 indicator
registers the level of pain.

22:54.606 --> 22:56.357
Now, watch it
as I turn it on.

23:09.538 --> 23:12.541
Now, that's what he's
been going through.

23:12.541 --> 23:14.042
I've never seen anything
like it.

23:14.042 --> 23:15.793
No wonder
the poor devils go mad.

23:27.639 --> 23:29.641
Dr. McCoy.

23:29.641 --> 23:30.642
Captain.

23:32.144 --> 23:32.978
Spock.

23:38.316 --> 23:41.819
These restraints will
no longer be necessary.

23:41.820 --> 23:42.821
Nor will your
sedatives, doctor.

23:44.322 --> 23:45.790
I'll be able to
return to duty.

23:46.741 --> 23:49.243
I apologize
for my weakness earlier,

23:49.244 --> 23:51.746
when I tried to take
control of the ship.

23:54.249 --> 23:55.667
I simply
did not understand.

23:57.636 --> 23:59.421
What is there to understand,
Mr. Spock?

24:00.222 --> 24:02.224
I am a Vulcan, doctor.

24:03.725 --> 24:06.728
Pain is a thing of the mind.

24:06.728 --> 24:08.813
The mind can be controlled.

24:08.814 --> 24:09.898
You're only half Vulcan.

24:09.898 --> 24:11.432
What about
the human half of you?

24:13.935 --> 24:16.103
It is proving to be
an inconvenience,

24:16.104 --> 24:18.689
but it is manageable.

24:18.690 --> 24:22.777
The creature, with all
of its thousands of parts,

24:22.777 --> 24:25.746
even now,
is pressuring me.

24:30.452 --> 24:34.456
It wants this ship.
But I am resisting.

24:34.456 --> 24:38.042
Can he control it
the way he says, Bones?

24:38.043 --> 24:40.045
Who knows, Jim?

24:40.045 --> 24:43.548
I know the amount of pain the
creature can inflict upon him.

24:43.548 --> 24:46.601
But whether he can control it,
hour to hour...

24:46.601 --> 24:48.603
I have my own will, captain.

24:50.689 --> 24:51.473
Let me help.

24:52.307 --> 24:53.224
I need you, Spock.

24:55.560 --> 24:58.062
But we can't
take any chances.

25:00.065 --> 25:04.569
We'll keep you confined
for a while longer.

25:04.569 --> 25:06.571
If you can...

25:06.571 --> 25:08.573
maintain control...

25:09.574 --> 25:10.458
we'll see.

25:16.381 --> 25:17.382
My nephew.

25:19.584 --> 25:21.919
If he regains consciousness,
will he go through that?

25:23.755 --> 25:24.672
Yes.

25:26.558 --> 25:28.059
Help them.

25:28.059 --> 25:30.061
I don't care what
it takes or costs,

25:30.061 --> 25:30.928
you've got to help them.

25:32.264 --> 25:33.598
Jim,

25:33.598 --> 25:35.683
aren't you forgetting something?

25:36.685 --> 25:38.186
There are over
a million colonists

25:38.186 --> 25:40.188
on that planet down there.

25:40.188 --> 25:42.023
Just as much
your responsibility.

25:43.858 --> 25:45.659
They need
your help too.

26:06.214 --> 26:08.716
I am a Vulcan.

26:09.718 --> 26:11.720
I am a Vulcan.

26:14.222 --> 26:17.225
There is no pain.

26:51.176 --> 26:52.677
Mr. Spock.

26:52.677 --> 26:55.179
I thought you were
still confined to Sickbay.

26:55.180 --> 26:56.681
I was.

26:56.681 --> 27:00.184
Here, now.
Where do you think you're going?

27:00.185 --> 27:02.820
I have an errand
on the planet surface.

27:02.821 --> 27:05.857
You will beam me down to the
same coordinates as before.

27:05.857 --> 27:07.859
Not likely,
Mr. Spock.

27:07.859 --> 27:09.360
That is an order,
Mr. Scott.

27:09.361 --> 27:10.862
Aye, sir.

27:10.862 --> 27:12.864
And I'm sorry
I have to disobey it.

27:12.864 --> 27:15.867
The captain said no one
was to transport down.

27:19.337 --> 27:20.338
Mr. Spock.

27:25.844 --> 27:29.848
Freeze right there,
Mr. Spock...

27:29.848 --> 27:32.350
or I'll put you
to sleep for sure.

27:45.864 --> 27:47.615
This is Mr. Scott
in the Transporter Room.

27:47.615 --> 27:48.482
Get me the captain.

27:57.625 --> 27:59.994
Mr. Spock, I gave you an order
to stay in the Sickbay.

27:59.994 --> 28:02.079
Until the pain was gone,
captain.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.999
It has been
discontinued, by me.

28:04.999 --> 28:06.667
Scotty?

28:06.668 --> 28:09.170
He said he was transporting
down to the surface, sir.

28:09.170 --> 28:10.671
Your orders were that
no one was to beam down

28:10.672 --> 28:12.173
unless you
authorized it.

28:12.173 --> 28:16.177
And knowing Mr. Spock's
determination on some things,

28:16.177 --> 28:18.095
I thought I'd better hold him
here until I got your orders.

28:20.598 --> 28:22.566
One of the creatures
will have to be captured

28:22.567 --> 28:24.569
and analyzed, captain.

28:24.569 --> 28:27.071
We did not have a clear
opportunity to do so earlier

28:27.072 --> 28:29.074
when I was
attacked.

28:29.074 --> 28:31.576
Since my nervous system
is already affected,

28:31.576 --> 28:32.443
as you pointed out,
doctor,

28:33.778 --> 28:36.781
I don't believe
they could do much more to me.

28:36.781 --> 28:38.282
Jim, this
is ridiculous.

28:38.283 --> 28:41.085
I don't want my patients running
around. He should be in bed.

28:43.288 --> 28:46.374
I am in complete control
of myself, doctor.

28:46.374 --> 28:50.378
The fact that I am here proves
that I do not belong in bed.

28:54.099 --> 28:55.183
Mr. Spock.

28:56.684 --> 28:59.687
Your logic,
as usual...

29:01.189 --> 29:02.190
is inescapable.

29:05.693 --> 29:08.195
Beam him down.
Stay in constant touch with us.

29:08.196 --> 29:10.531
Give him your phaser.
He'll need that too.

29:13.151 --> 29:14.535
Thank you, captain.

29:23.128 --> 29:24.129
Energize.

29:44.599 --> 29:47.151
Jim,
that man is sick.

29:47.152 --> 29:48.653
And don't give me
any damnable logic

29:48.653 --> 29:50.655
about him being
the only man for the job.

29:50.655 --> 29:53.157
I don't have to, Bones.
We both know he is.

32:24.559 --> 32:25.560
Come in,
gentlemen.

32:27.061 --> 32:29.063
I believe you'll find this
interesting.

32:32.567 --> 32:36.571
Doctor, your medical skill
and curiosity

32:36.571 --> 32:39.574
are quite admirable,
but I assure you, I'm all right.

32:39.574 --> 32:43.027
You may be controlling
the pain, Mr. Spock,

32:43.027 --> 32:45.779
but you're far
from all right.

32:45.780 --> 32:47.615
Unimportant at the
moment, doctor.

32:48.783 --> 32:50.367
Please observe.

32:55.790 --> 32:59.009
Interesting,
gentlemen.

32:59.010 --> 33:02.046
A one-cell creature resembling,
more than anything else,

33:02.046 --> 33:05.599
a huge individual
brain cell.

33:05.600 --> 33:08.219
Yes, that would answer
a lot of questions, wouldn't it?

33:08.219 --> 33:10.104
Do you understand
what I'm suggesting, captain?

33:10.855 --> 33:12.389
I think so.

33:12.390 --> 33:15.393
This may be one cell
in a larger organism,

33:15.393 --> 33:17.978
an incredibly huge
organism, in fact.

33:17.979 --> 33:20.064
And although it is not
physically connected

33:20.064 --> 33:21.532
to the other cells,

33:21.532 --> 33:24.484
it is, nevertheless,
part of the whole creature.

33:24.485 --> 33:27.571
Guided by the whole,
drawing its strength

33:27.572 --> 33:30.074
from the whole,
which probably accounts

33:30.074 --> 33:33.710
for its unusual resistance
to our phaser weapons.

33:33.711 --> 33:38.215
Existing so differently
from any living matter or energy

33:38.216 --> 33:40.251
as we know it
that it may have come here,

33:40.251 --> 33:43.971
planet by planet, from an
entirely different galaxy.

33:45.306 --> 33:48.309
From a place where
our physical laws do not apply.

33:48.309 --> 33:51.312
We may therefore find it
difficult to destroy, captain.

33:51.312 --> 33:53.897
But not impossible,
Mr. Spock.

33:53.898 --> 33:56.400
The Denevan that flew into the
sun cried out that he was free,

33:56.401 --> 33:57.902
that he had won.

33:57.902 --> 34:00.404
That's the angle
to work on, gentlemen.

34:00.405 --> 34:02.857
I want an
analysis of all this

34:02.857 --> 34:05.743
from Medical and Life Science
departments within the hour.

34:07.361 --> 34:08.328
Yes, sir.

34:42.780 --> 34:46.283
I'm sorry, captain.
I've tried everything I can.

34:46.284 --> 34:49.286
Varying radiation, intense heat,
even as great as 9,000 degrees.

34:49.286 --> 34:51.789
Then you're
wasting your time.

34:51.789 --> 34:53.791
It has to be something
that will kill the creature

34:53.791 --> 34:55.292
without destroying
the human host.

34:55.293 --> 34:57.712
Which happens to be my point:
The thing won't die.

34:57.712 --> 34:59.797
Even at temperatures
and radiation

34:59.797 --> 35:02.299
which would burn Spock
and your nephew to ashes.

35:02.300 --> 35:03.301
I can't accept that,
Bones.

35:05.803 --> 35:09.306
We've got 14 science labs
aboard this ship.

35:09.307 --> 35:11.809
The finest equipment
and computers in the galaxy.

35:11.809 --> 35:12.810
Captain.

35:14.812 --> 35:17.314
I understand
your concern.

35:17.315 --> 35:19.817
Your affection
for Spock,

35:19.817 --> 35:21.318
the fact that
your nephew

35:21.319 --> 35:23.321
is the last survivor
of your brother's family.

35:23.321 --> 35:24.822
No. No, Bones.

35:26.324 --> 35:29.327
There's more than two lives
at stake here.

35:29.327 --> 35:32.330
I cannot let it spread
beyond this colony,

35:32.330 --> 35:34.332
even if it means
destroying...

35:35.333 --> 35:37.835
a million people
down there.

35:44.292 --> 35:48.796
Captain's log, stardate 3289.8.

35:48.796 --> 35:52.299
I am faced with the most
difficult decision of my life.

35:52.300 --> 35:54.802
Unless we find a way
to destroy the creatures

35:54.802 --> 35:57.304
without killing
their human hosts,

35:57.305 --> 36:00.308
my command responsibilities
will force me to kill

36:00.308 --> 36:03.027
over a million people.

36:03.027 --> 36:04.895
Gentlemen?

36:04.896 --> 36:07.114
I regret I see no other choice
for you, captain.

36:07.114 --> 36:10.617
We already know this thing has
destroyed three civilizations,

36:10.618 --> 36:12.236
perhaps more.

36:12.236 --> 36:13.820
Gentlemen, I want it
stopped too,

36:13.821 --> 36:14.822
but not at the cost

36:14.822 --> 36:16.323
of destroying
over a million people.

36:16.324 --> 36:18.826
Including myself,
doctor,

36:18.826 --> 36:21.128
and Captain Kirk's
young nephew.

36:22.413 --> 36:24.915
Understandably upsetting.

36:24.916 --> 36:26.918
But once it spreads
past here,

36:26.918 --> 36:28.719
there are dozens
of colonies beyond,

36:28.719 --> 36:31.304
and billions of people.

36:31.305 --> 36:35.175
If killing five people
saves ten, it's a bargain.

36:35.176 --> 36:37.478
Is that your simple logic,
Mr. Spock?

36:37.478 --> 36:41.064
I will accept neither of
those alternatives, gentlemen.

36:41.065 --> 36:43.567
I cannot let this thing expand
beyond this planet,

36:43.568 --> 36:45.069
nor do I intend to kill

36:45.069 --> 36:47.071
a million or more
people to stop it.

36:47.071 --> 36:48.355
I want another answer.

36:52.276 --> 36:54.361
I'm putting you gentlemen
on the hot seat with me.

36:54.362 --> 36:56.364
I want that
third alternative.

37:03.921 --> 37:04.922
Report.

37:04.922 --> 37:06.423
I'm sorry, Jim.

37:06.424 --> 37:07.425
We've been over it
and over it,

37:07.425 --> 37:08.926
we've made every
conceivable test.

37:08.926 --> 37:10.427
I therefore
request permission

37:10.428 --> 37:12.430
to beam down to
the planet's surface.

37:12.430 --> 37:14.432
I also suggest your
nephew accompany me.

37:14.432 --> 37:15.933
Request denied.

37:15.933 --> 37:18.018
Captain.

37:18.019 --> 37:20.521
I do not make
this request lightly.

37:20.521 --> 37:24.525
I do not know how much longer
I can hold out against the pain,

37:24.525 --> 37:26.643
but I do know
what the boy will go through

37:26.644 --> 37:27.695
should he
regain consciousness.

37:30.231 --> 37:31.565
Request denied.

37:34.619 --> 37:38.205
There must be
another answer.

37:38.205 --> 37:42.709
Something in the sun
killed that thing,

37:42.710 --> 37:43.460
before the Denevan died.

37:46.998 --> 37:49.050
All right.

37:49.050 --> 37:50.634
All right.

37:50.635 --> 37:52.637
You've tried heat...

37:54.588 --> 37:55.639
radiation...

37:57.642 --> 38:00.645
What other qualities or
properties does the sun have?

38:02.513 --> 38:04.515
It exists physically.

38:04.515 --> 38:06.517
It occupies space.

38:06.517 --> 38:09.603
It has mass, therefore gravity.

38:09.603 --> 38:11.104
It converts matter
to energy.

38:14.659 --> 38:16.694
Jim, we've been through it
and through it.

38:19.080 --> 38:20.498
Radiation, heat...

38:21.832 --> 38:23.834
But one other thing
you haven't mentioned.

38:26.671 --> 38:28.205
It's bright.

38:28.205 --> 38:30.957
It radiates a blinding light,
if you're close enough.

38:30.958 --> 38:32.759
Nothing lethal
about light.

38:32.760 --> 38:33.844
Not to us.

38:33.844 --> 38:36.346
But down on the surface, the
creatures stayed in the shadows,

38:36.347 --> 38:37.848
for the most part.

38:37.848 --> 38:39.850
Suppose that they
weren't simply hiding.

38:39.850 --> 38:41.935
Suppose they're
sensitive to light.

38:41.936 --> 38:43.520
Light, like in a sun,
close up.

38:47.358 --> 38:49.443
A possibility.

38:49.443 --> 38:52.195
You can't move Deneva
closer to the sun, Jim.

38:52.196 --> 38:54.948
No, but you can move the
equivalent of the sun to Deneva.

38:54.949 --> 38:56.033
Mr. Spock?

38:56.033 --> 38:57.034
Yes.

38:57.034 --> 38:59.536
In essence,
it can be done.

38:59.537 --> 39:01.539
A string of satellites
around the planet

39:01.539 --> 39:03.490
with burning trimagnesite
and trevium.

39:07.128 --> 39:10.131
Well, I can rig
a test cubicle in the bio lab,

39:10.131 --> 39:11.132
put our specimen in it,

39:11.132 --> 39:13.717
but I don't..
Good.

39:13.718 --> 39:14.969
Let's get on it.

39:27.565 --> 39:30.067
Your figures are,
of course, accurate?

39:30.067 --> 39:31.568
Of course.

39:31.569 --> 39:34.572
The light of the sun
at the proximity

39:34.572 --> 39:36.574
where the Denevan
declared himself free

39:36.574 --> 39:39.577
was one million candles
per square inch.

39:39.577 --> 39:41.078
If this works,

39:41.078 --> 39:43.080
the satellites we orbit
will produce light

39:43.080 --> 39:45.582
of such intensity
that even someone

39:45.583 --> 39:48.586
in a closed, darkened area
will be affected by it.

39:48.586 --> 39:50.087
Ready, doctor.

39:50.087 --> 39:51.538
Put on your masks.

40:05.553 --> 40:07.054
Completed.

40:17.231 --> 40:19.316
It worked!
We can do it.

40:26.991 --> 40:28.492
What's the matter, Jim?
We can do it.

40:28.492 --> 40:30.494
It worked in a lab,

40:30.494 --> 40:33.497
with the creature exposed
to everything we can give it.

40:33.497 --> 40:36.500
But what about the people
who are infected?

40:36.500 --> 40:38.001
I don't know.
It may be trial and..

40:38.002 --> 40:40.504
Maybe. There's no time
for maybes, Bones.

40:40.504 --> 40:42.005
We need to know now.

40:42.006 --> 40:43.507
But I'd have to put..

40:43.507 --> 40:47.511
Yes, we'd have to put someone
who's infected under that light.

40:49.513 --> 40:52.516
Do you have any idea
of the risk?

40:52.516 --> 40:55.018
We have to duplicate
the conditions on the planet...

40:56.520 --> 40:58.522
and Spock...

40:58.522 --> 40:59.523
Captain.

41:01.025 --> 41:05.496
You'll need a host
for the next step in the test,

41:05.496 --> 41:06.997
to determine
whether the creature

41:06.997 --> 41:08.999
can be driven from the body.

41:08.999 --> 41:11.701
I am the logical choice.

41:11.702 --> 41:14.921
Do you know what one million
candlelight per square inch

41:14.922 --> 41:17.257
can do to
your optic nerves?

41:17.258 --> 41:18.342
There's no other way, Bones.

41:18.342 --> 41:19.960
We have to duplicate
the brilliance

41:19.960 --> 41:21.044
that existed
at the moment

41:21.045 --> 41:23.047
the Denevan declared
himself free.

41:25.549 --> 41:29.185
All right. I'll rig up
a protective pair of goggles.

41:29.186 --> 41:31.721
There will be none
on the planet's surface, doctor.

41:33.107 --> 41:34.525
I agree completely.

41:37.394 --> 41:39.312
Unfortunately,
you're both right.

41:41.615 --> 41:44.200
It's the only thing
we can do.

41:44.201 --> 41:46.152
All right, Mr. Spock.

42:25.743 --> 42:28.912
Mr. Spock's the best
first officer in the fleet.

42:28.913 --> 42:29.997
Proceed.

42:56.690 --> 42:58.224
Completed.

43:16.660 --> 43:18.128
Spock, are you
all right?

43:18.128 --> 43:20.163
The creature within me
is gone.

43:20.164 --> 43:22.666
I am free of it
and the pain.

43:27.554 --> 43:29.556
And I am also...

43:29.556 --> 43:30.557
quite blind.

43:32.559 --> 43:35.562
An equitable trade,
doctor.

43:35.562 --> 43:36.563
Thank you.

43:45.155 --> 43:47.157
Doctor, the results
of the first test

43:47.157 --> 43:48.525
on the creature's
remains...

43:58.369 --> 43:59.370
Oh, no.

44:01.872 --> 44:04.374
What is it?

44:04.375 --> 44:07.378
I threw the total spectrum
of light at the creature.

44:07.378 --> 44:08.178
It wasn't necessary.

44:11.465 --> 44:13.550
I didn't stop to think that...

44:13.550 --> 44:15.602
only one kind of light
might have killed it.

44:15.602 --> 44:17.186
Interesting.

44:17.187 --> 44:20.690
Just as dogs are sensitive
to certain sounds

44:20.691 --> 44:22.192
which humans cannot hear,

44:22.192 --> 44:25.395
these creatures evidently
are sensitive to light

44:25.396 --> 44:26.647
which we cannot see.

44:26.647 --> 44:29.232
Are you telling me...

44:29.233 --> 44:31.235
that Spock
need not have been blinded?

44:34.204 --> 44:35.738
I didn't need to throw

44:35.739 --> 44:37.240
the blinding white light
at all, Jim.

44:42.162 --> 44:44.130
Spock, I..

44:44.131 --> 44:47.217
Doctor, it was
my selection as well.

44:47.217 --> 44:48.218
It is done.

44:52.339 --> 44:53.223
Bones...

44:58.395 --> 44:59.679
Take care of him.

45:15.362 --> 45:17.447
Completing
the seeding orbit, captain.

45:17.448 --> 45:20.951
Two hundred and ten ultraviolet
satellites now in position,

45:20.951 --> 45:23.453
72 miles altitude,

45:23.454 --> 45:25.456
permanent orbit
about the planet.

45:25.456 --> 45:26.457
Good. Scanners?

45:28.459 --> 45:29.793
Scanners ready, sir.

45:29.793 --> 45:31.878
Very well.
Ready, helm?

45:31.879 --> 45:33.380
Ready, captain.

45:33.380 --> 45:35.382
Satellite control,
this is the captain.

45:35.382 --> 45:37.967
Energize all satellites.

45:37.968 --> 45:39.686
Affirmative.

45:39.686 --> 45:41.554
All satellites operative,
captain.

46:23.313 --> 46:26.399
Captain, receiving messages
from a ground station.

46:26.400 --> 46:28.402
Report.

46:28.402 --> 46:30.404
The things are dying, sir.
It's working.

46:41.665 --> 46:42.582
Sickbay.

46:44.952 --> 46:45.919
McCoy here.

46:48.372 --> 46:49.373
Tell Spock...

46:50.290 --> 46:51.341
it worked.

46:54.261 --> 46:56.763
Yes, captain.

46:56.763 --> 46:58.181
He'll be happy
to hear that.

47:01.602 --> 47:02.603
Bones...

47:05.105 --> 47:06.523
it wasn't your fault.

47:08.942 --> 47:09.943
Bones.

47:13.113 --> 47:14.114
Bones.

47:25.375 --> 47:27.877
Yeoman, record this
for Starfleet Command.

47:27.878 --> 47:29.379
Ready, sir.

47:29.379 --> 47:31.381
The alien creatures on Deneva
have been destroyed..

47:31.381 --> 47:32.882
Captain, look.
Mr. Spock.

47:36.086 --> 47:36.669
Spock.

47:40.424 --> 47:41.308
You can see.

47:43.844 --> 47:45.428
The blindness was
temporary, Jim.

47:45.429 --> 47:47.431
There's something
about his optical nerves

47:47.431 --> 47:49.483
which aren't the same
as a human's.

47:49.483 --> 47:52.185
An hereditary trait,
captain.

47:52.185 --> 47:55.404
The brightness of the Vulcan sun
has caused the development

47:55.405 --> 47:58.157
of an inner eyelid,
which acts as a shield

47:58.158 --> 47:59.742
against high-intensity
light.

47:59.743 --> 48:02.278
Totally instinctive,
doctor.

48:02.279 --> 48:04.364
We tend to ignore it,
as you ignore your own appendix.

48:13.173 --> 48:14.674
Mr. Spock.

48:18.178 --> 48:21.714
Regaining eyesight would be an
emotional experience for most.

48:21.715 --> 48:23.633
You, I presume,
felt nothing?

48:23.634 --> 48:27.804
Quite the contrary, captain.
I had a very strong reaction.

48:27.804 --> 48:31.357
My first sight was the face
of Dr. McCoy bending over me.

48:31.358 --> 48:32.859
Mm.

48:32.859 --> 48:36.479
'Tis a pity brief blindness did
not increase your appreciation

48:36.480 --> 48:38.198
for beauty,
Mr. Spock.

48:38.198 --> 48:39.282
If you gentlemen
are finished,

48:39.283 --> 48:40.284
would you mind laying in

48:40.284 --> 48:41.785
a course for
Starbase 10, Mr. Spock?

48:41.785 --> 48:42.786
My pleasure,
captain.

48:47.457 --> 48:49.542
Unusual eye arrangement.

48:51.545 --> 48:54.047
I might've known he'd turn up
with something like that.

48:54.047 --> 48:55.048
What's that, doctor?

48:55.048 --> 48:56.549
I said, please
don't tell Spock

48:56.550 --> 48:59.336
that I said he was the best
first officer in the fleet.

49:00.587 --> 49:02.505
Why, thank you, Dr. McCoy.

49:04.508 --> 49:07.093
You've been so concerned
about his Vulcan eyes, doctor,

49:07.094 --> 49:09.096
you forgot about
his Vulcan ears.

49:09.096 --> 49:10.597
Ahead warp factor 1,
Mr. Sulu.

49:10.597 --> 49:12.098
Warp factor 1, sir.
