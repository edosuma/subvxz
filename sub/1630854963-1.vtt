WEBVTT

01:35.796 --> 01:36.797
So, what did he do?

01:38.832 --> 01:40.000
It's what he's gonna do.

01:41.469 --> 01:44.605
Fuck's sake. Davids!
Eyes on the road.

01:56.284 --> 01:57.285
Davids!

03:06.787 --> 03:08.256
Go and check on them.

03:08.256 --> 03:09.823
Get with the fucking program.

04:11.519 --> 04:13.287
Stay with the informant.

05:23.357 --> 05:24.658
Oh, thanks, man.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.126
Did Mike send you?

05:26.126 --> 05:27.495
Oh, fuck, man.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.530
Did you kill them all?

05:42.009 --> 05:45.579
Wait, wait.

05:45.579 --> 05:46.980
Who sent you?

05:48.416 --> 05:49.650
Please, man.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.919
I'll give you
whatever you want.

05:51.919 --> 05:54.221
You have nothing I want.

05:54.221 --> 05:55.823
I have kids.

05:55.823 --> 05:58.392
Please. There's money.

05:58.392 --> 05:59.760
Loads of it.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.996
You can get out
of the game like me, man.

06:02.996 --> 06:06.600
Why would I want that?

06:06.600 --> 06:07.868
Who are you?

06:10.871 --> 06:12.440
I'm nobody.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.200
Fuck.

07:06.694 --> 07:07.795
Speak.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.930
I've lost a witness.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.364
He saw my face.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.603
I've been made.

07:15.603 --> 07:16.970
Share your location.

07:16.970 --> 07:20.508
We'll send a car.
Time for you to disappear again.

09:48.689 --> 09:52.826
Ah, you like to keep
the night shift busy, don't you?

09:52.826 --> 09:54.227
Because
you're always here.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.096
I heard you were back.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.597
Always a pleasure, Forge.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.799
You've been here
so many times,

09:58.799 --> 10:02.836
it's easy to fast-track
a new identity for you.

10:02.836 --> 10:06.173
I'll get your new documents
turned over.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.776
Tonight.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.045
Please.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.749
You're not
the only resident tonight.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.818
Some particularly
nefarious types

10:17.818 --> 10:20.988
who won't take kindly
to queue jumpers.

10:20.988 --> 10:22.455
I'll see what I can do.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.490
Thank you.

10:23.490 --> 10:25.625
Good night, Walker.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.827
Smithee.

10:26.827 --> 10:27.828
Good night.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.329
Get him processed
before lockdown.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.832
Right.
Personals are next.

10:31.832 --> 10:32.866
Follow me.

10:33.867 --> 10:34.835
- Hey.
- Oh.

10:34.835 --> 10:35.936
Just the man I need.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.470
Me?
You--you--you need me?

10:37.470 --> 10:39.306
Uh, I mean yes.
I--I can help.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.308
What--what--
what do you need?

10:41.308 --> 10:43.276
Uh, just the keys
to the upstairs office.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.478
Oh, uh...
o--o--of course.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.314
Um... when--

10:47.314 --> 10:49.750
when the renovation is done
and it's all electronic, you--

10:49.750 --> 10:51.084
you won't need me as much.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.352
Not the keys at least.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.756
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.059
Um, what is it?
It's not this one.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.660
Ah.

11:00.660 --> 11:04.331
Sorry, it's a bit stiff.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.233
Here. This one.

11:06.233 --> 11:07.234
Yes.

11:07.234 --> 11:11.004
Perfect. Thanks.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.039
Thanks.

11:13.473 --> 11:14.541
Perfect...

11:16.810 --> 11:18.278
what?

11:18.278 --> 11:19.479
Come on.

11:19.479 --> 11:20.781
All right.

11:20.781 --> 11:21.749
Locking down

11:21.749 --> 11:23.583
will commence in 15 minutes.

11:23.583 --> 11:25.285
A word of advice.

11:25.285 --> 11:26.987
For me?
What--what for?

11:26.987 --> 11:29.056
When a girl
opens a door for you,

11:29.056 --> 11:32.525
do everyone a favor
and walk through it.

11:33.761 --> 11:34.828
- Smithee.
- Smithee.

11:34.828 --> 11:37.497
Doesn't that get confusing?

11:37.497 --> 11:38.766
Coming from someone
who has a new name

11:38.766 --> 11:40.868
nearly every week.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.170
Fair.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.038
Just watch your step,
huh, Mr. Walker.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.343
Ah, right.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.980
No attempting to contact anyone
outside the facility.

11:54.782 --> 11:55.983
You know about
the signal jammer?

11:55.983 --> 11:57.650
Yes.

11:57.650 --> 11:58.952
Dietary require--

12:03.456 --> 12:06.426
So, I guess that's not relevant
to you, is it?

12:06.426 --> 12:09.229
Hm. No?

12:09.229 --> 12:12.632
Okay.

12:16.804 --> 12:17.805
That it?

12:27.447 --> 12:30.050
As always,
you'll be locked in overnight.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.319
It's still the best way to keep
everyone minding their business

12:32.319 --> 12:34.654
during the night shift's
minimal security.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.291
At least until we upgrade.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.728
The case, sir.

12:41.728 --> 12:42.729
This stays with me.

12:42.729 --> 12:44.264
I don't think
you understand, sir.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.833
Nothing stays with you.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.100
I don't think
you understand,

12:47.100 --> 12:48.969
ya fucking tea leaf
little prick.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.303
This case stays with me.

12:50.303 --> 12:51.604
Right, fingerprints.

12:51.604 --> 12:52.806
Am I going to
have to call security, sir?

12:54.007 --> 12:55.809
Why the fuck
you calling me sir?

12:55.809 --> 12:57.477
Chop-chop, Mr. Walker.

13:02.182 --> 13:06.419
I assure you,
it's for the system to work.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.442
You get your ass...

15:09.442 --> 15:11.111
Sir, I--

15:38.838 --> 15:41.608
On schedule, I see.
Keep this up

15:41.608 --> 15:43.343
and I'll start
believing I can rely on you.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.278
Yes, sir.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.248
The place is about to lock down.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.317
Security is as easy
as we thought.

15:50.317 --> 15:51.318
Now, that's the problem

15:51.318 --> 15:53.820
when goodwill
is your main security protocol.

15:53.820 --> 15:56.489
It tends to expire.
Especially mine.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.825
I've sent you the target.
Make this neat.

15:58.825 --> 16:01.928
Make this tidy.
No witnesses.

16:01.928 --> 16:06.299
I want her breathing.
Otherwise, you won't be.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.178
Get Keates.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.181
Wait.

16:21.181 --> 16:25.485
And the details of every single
fucker inside these walls.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.519
No one survives.

16:30.190 --> 16:33.160
This is gonna be fun.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.278
What's she look like?

16:54.447 --> 16:55.615
Not your type.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.487
Yours?

17:06.025 --> 17:08.161
Either way, she's dead.

17:08.161 --> 17:09.362
Alive, Keates.

17:12.365 --> 17:15.368
All right, guys,
let's draw some blood.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.298
Locking doors for lockdown.

18:57.637 --> 19:01.308
- Ah! Oh, ah.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.643
- Sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Don't do that.

19:03.643 --> 19:04.911
- I--I--I just, um...
- Oh, gosh.

19:04.911 --> 19:08.781
You almost gave me
a heart... attack...

19:08.781 --> 19:09.949
- In fact...
- Oh, God.

19:09.949 --> 19:11.918
Oh, God. Um...

19:11.918 --> 19:16.323
Oh, your face is priceless.

19:16.323 --> 19:18.925
Just--just--
just wanted to say bye.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.127
S--s--sorry.
Bye-bye then.

19:21.127 --> 19:24.297
I got the new
Freedom Alliance box set,

19:24.297 --> 19:25.665
all six seasons.

19:25.665 --> 19:28.067
Maybe you could come and
watch them with me next week--

19:28.067 --> 19:32.104
if you want to watch them,
I mean.

19:32.104 --> 19:33.773
- Is that the door?
- Huh?

19:33.773 --> 19:36.809
Hm? I mean,
uh, y--y--yes.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.911
That... that would be lovely.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.146
Great.

19:40.146 --> 19:44.050
Um, so I got these with
the Freedom Alliance box set.

19:44.050 --> 19:45.552
I--I don't know
if you want them.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.119
Freedom Alliance pens.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.088
These... these were
limited edition.

19:49.088 --> 19:50.890
I...I saw you, you know,

19:50.890 --> 19:52.425
looking on the internet
and stuff for them

19:52.425 --> 19:55.328
and I just figured
they'd end up in my drawers.

19:55.328 --> 19:58.598
So, I will see you next week.

19:58.598 --> 19:59.766
Not if I see you first.
But that--

19:59.766 --> 20:00.767
but I do--I--

20:00.767 --> 20:03.336
I do want to see you
first--last--sorry.

20:03.336 --> 20:05.772
- Six seasons, remember?
- To the future.

20:41.474 --> 20:42.609

Security breach.
Shutting down.

24:13.520 --> 24:16.656
Please
immediately.

24:16.656 --> 24:18.591
Security breach.

24:27.033 --> 24:28.267
We don't have much time.

24:28.267 --> 24:29.502
We need your help.

24:29.502 --> 24:30.503
Do I know you?

24:30.503 --> 24:32.905
No, but I know you.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.774
Get out of my room.

24:34.774 --> 24:36.976
- I'm--
- No personal details.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.679
We need your help.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.581
Lock the door
on the way out.

24:41.581 --> 24:42.915
The compound's been sieged.

24:42.915 --> 24:44.717
They want us dead.

24:44.717 --> 24:46.318
That sounds like
a "you" problem.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.588
Or you could just
wait to get shot.

24:52.458 --> 24:54.493
You're obviously
not who I thought you were.

24:54.493 --> 24:58.698
Sorry to disappoint.

25:00.199 --> 25:01.534
Juliet.

25:15.381 --> 25:16.549
The key!

25:53.485 --> 25:55.087
Security breach.

27:29.381 --> 27:31.483
Do you know how to use that?

27:31.483 --> 27:35.121
Says the guy
who has a bullet in his arm.

27:36.522 --> 27:38.758
Touché.

27:41.928 --> 27:43.495
Do you want me
to come back later?

27:43.495 --> 27:44.997
- Wanna help now, do you?
- No.

27:44.997 --> 27:48.000
But you left my door open
and got me shot.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.368
Serves you right.

27:50.369 --> 27:51.804
These guys have
firepower.

27:51.804 --> 27:53.005
We need more weapons.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.006
There's no we.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.174
And who the fuck
are these guys?

27:55.174 --> 27:56.843
And she's definitely
not supposed to be--

27:56.843 --> 27:58.677
"She" is stood
right here.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.446
Come on.

28:00.446 --> 28:01.447
Juliet.

28:01.447 --> 28:02.782
This one is on you.

28:02.782 --> 28:03.950
Get down there.

28:53.132 --> 28:54.366
I must stop
finding you like this.

28:57.036 --> 28:58.270
I had it under control.

28:58.270 --> 28:59.305
Yeah. Clearly.

29:05.011 --> 29:06.779
What you looking at?

29:13.953 --> 29:14.921
We need to move.

29:14.921 --> 29:16.322
We've got to get
to the weapons lockup

29:16.322 --> 29:17.824
if we're going to
weather this storm.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.128
You're bleeding.

29:22.128 --> 29:23.595
I'm fine. Take this.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.297
Let's go.

29:26.498 --> 29:28.400
- Are you coming?
- We can't trust him.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.601
You came to me.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.337
When someone shows me
who they are, I believe them.

29:31.337 --> 29:32.738
- We need him.
- He doesn't need you,

29:32.738 --> 29:34.773
- I'm afraid.
- Prick.

31:27.186 --> 31:29.321
Hey, any eyes
on the little one?

31:29.321 --> 31:30.589
Nope.

31:30.589 --> 31:31.890
You got a light?

31:31.890 --> 31:32.925
Sure.

31:36.963 --> 31:38.397
So, you seen
her picture?

31:38.397 --> 31:39.531
No, have you?

31:41.667 --> 31:43.002
Let's put it this way.

31:43.002 --> 31:45.737
If it's me against [indistinct],
she won't be walking for a week.

31:45.737 --> 31:46.772
You're sick.

31:51.043 --> 31:52.844
Oy, we only had
a couple of puffs.

31:52.844 --> 31:54.380
Don't waste it.

32:04.023 --> 32:06.192
[echoes] Dad.

32:16.502 --> 32:17.503
Oy.

32:18.537 --> 32:20.472
That was easy.

32:20.472 --> 32:22.274
Come on, princess.

32:32.018 --> 32:33.452
I was trying to
keep this quiet but--

32:33.452 --> 32:34.520
You're welcome.

32:35.821 --> 32:36.989
You okay?

32:36.989 --> 32:38.057
Yeah.

32:38.057 --> 32:39.358
Let's go.

32:50.202 --> 32:52.838
To the weapons.

32:52.838 --> 32:55.407
I need guns, phasers.
Set phasers.

32:55.407 --> 32:57.743
I have three phasers,
limited edition,

32:57.743 --> 33:00.779
original boxes.
Just pull yourself together.

33:00.779 --> 33:02.081
I need to get to the weapons.

33:02.081 --> 33:04.450
Don't die. Live long--

33:05.917 --> 33:08.154
Okay. No guns.

33:08.154 --> 33:10.589
No guns. No guns.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.443
How did you know
it was there?

33:31.443 --> 33:33.845
It's where
I would put it.

33:36.115 --> 33:37.516
Argh.

33:44.790 --> 33:46.625
What are you looking for?

33:46.625 --> 33:49.195
Keys to the gun closet.

34:03.942 --> 34:06.011
Just the man we need.

34:06.011 --> 34:09.047
Gosh, I'd hate to be
the man you didn't need.

34:12.651 --> 34:13.652
What's that
doing on the floor?

34:14.920 --> 34:16.422
What's that doing on the floor?

34:16.422 --> 34:19.591
We need the keys
to the gun closet.

34:19.591 --> 34:20.792
The guns, Smithee.

34:20.792 --> 34:21.927
What guns?

34:22.994 --> 34:24.263
Oh, those guns.

34:24.263 --> 34:26.632
Oh, no, not on me.
Not that one.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.834
I know we look ramshackle
at the moment,

34:28.834 --> 34:31.002
but some things have to remain
pretty secure,

34:31.002 --> 34:33.405
firearms being priority, but...

34:33.405 --> 34:34.773
But what?

34:34.773 --> 34:37.643
Have you checked the
in-tray of unprocessed items?

34:37.643 --> 34:38.844
The in-tray?

34:49.821 --> 34:51.790
The in-tray.

34:51.790 --> 34:52.824
No guns, but...

34:54.460 --> 34:55.794
Yes.
It's very nice.

34:57.763 --> 34:58.964
What are these?

34:58.964 --> 35:00.399
Smoke grenades.

35:00.399 --> 35:02.734
Save your pocket
for something more useful.

35:02.734 --> 35:04.970
I don't know.
I think it might come in handy.

35:09.441 --> 35:10.409
Be careful with that.

35:10.409 --> 35:11.443
I'm not quite sure
why it was checked in.

35:13.645 --> 35:14.780
Oh, that's what it does.

35:14.780 --> 35:15.847
Give it to me.

35:15.847 --> 35:17.048
Very MI6.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.187
The weapons lockout,
it's down here.

35:23.822 --> 35:25.424
Juliet, get ready
with that smoke.

35:47.546 --> 35:50.516
Juliet, smoke!

37:05.691 --> 37:06.925
Gosh.

37:08.594 --> 37:09.795
Ha! Ugh!

37:18.604 --> 37:20.839
I'm--I'm not gonna die?

37:20.839 --> 37:22.441
No.
You're gonna be fine.

37:23.442 --> 37:24.610
Thank you.

37:26.878 --> 37:28.213
Ugh.

37:30.449 --> 37:33.919
S--so sorry.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.186
It's okay.

37:57.275 --> 37:58.544
Fuck.

38:03.148 --> 38:05.050
We gotta get
that bullet out of you.

38:07.586 --> 38:09.321
I'll be fine.

38:10.322 --> 38:12.691
There has to be some
medical shit in the lab.

38:31.042 --> 38:32.110
Are you okay?

38:32.110 --> 38:36.114
Yeah. Just hot.

38:36.114 --> 38:37.683
I'm fine, thanks.

38:42.354 --> 38:44.155
You've been knocked up.

38:44.155 --> 38:46.658
The cause of all this?

38:46.658 --> 38:47.926
You don't need to
know the details.

38:47.926 --> 38:49.828
I'm here
with a piece of crap in my leg

38:49.828 --> 38:51.997
because you two
is too incompetent

38:51.997 --> 38:53.331
to lock a fucking door.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.000
Don't tell me
what I need to know.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.167
Mention that one more time.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.268
Argh!

38:57.268 --> 38:59.304
I dare you.

39:02.207 --> 39:04.175
- I'm fine.
- The baby?

39:04.175 --> 39:05.977
Hopefully not.

39:08.647 --> 39:11.483
Argh!

39:17.923 --> 39:19.591
I'm waiting.

39:21.627 --> 39:23.762
Our work requires
we don't ask questions.

39:23.762 --> 39:24.763
Don't get attached.

39:24.763 --> 39:27.232
Something
you are totally incapable of.

39:27.232 --> 39:29.468
This time...
I couldn't walk away.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.304
Why?

39:33.304 --> 39:35.340
Let's just say
at some point,

39:35.340 --> 39:38.510
your past refuses to stay... past.

39:39.978 --> 39:43.014
I got involved
in a kidnapping...

39:43.014 --> 39:44.215
four women.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.218
Sex trafficking?

39:51.089 --> 39:52.791
Who was she sold to?

39:53.792 --> 39:54.993
There was a buyer,

39:54.993 --> 39:57.996
but the boss
took a liking to her.

39:57.996 --> 40:00.298
Even more so when he found out
about the baby.

40:00.298 --> 40:02.033
These rings are impenetrable.

40:03.268 --> 40:06.438
But when he decided
he wanted to keep her,

40:06.438 --> 40:09.508
it caused problems, delays.

40:09.508 --> 40:11.443
Delays which gave me opportunity.

40:11.443 --> 40:12.478
To steal her.

40:12.478 --> 40:13.812
Stealing
implies ownership.

40:13.812 --> 40:16.548
That's how
they all see it.

40:27.125 --> 40:28.293
This past of yours...?

40:30.496 --> 40:32.931
Hit a little close, did it?

40:34.766 --> 40:39.104
My life in this world...

40:39.104 --> 40:41.773
all started when
I was stolen as a child,

40:44.375 --> 40:47.813
in broad daylight,
from the streets of Naples.

40:49.447 --> 40:52.083
I won't let those things
happen anymore to others.

40:52.083 --> 40:53.384
Not on my watch.

40:55.353 --> 40:57.689
No more innocence destroyed.

41:00.492 --> 41:03.629
You used to do the same.
Protect innocence.

41:04.630 --> 41:08.667
Getting
emotionally attached...

41:08.667 --> 41:10.536
only leads to one thing...

41:13.104 --> 41:14.506
just ask Smithee.

41:21.146 --> 41:23.682
The baby, is it his?

41:28.353 --> 41:29.487
I need to call my handler.

41:29.487 --> 41:30.589
What? No.

41:30.589 --> 41:32.891
He's the only man
on this planet I trust.

41:32.891 --> 41:34.259
We can't trust anyone.

41:34.259 --> 41:36.194
You have
a better solution?

41:39.030 --> 41:39.998
Fine.

41:39.998 --> 41:42.133
We need to
deactivate the signal jammer

41:42.133 --> 41:44.002
to get a call out.

41:44.002 --> 41:45.937
You stay here.

41:45.937 --> 41:49.507
I need to... to turn off
the signal jammer.

41:49.507 --> 41:50.709
Where's that?

41:52.377 --> 41:53.679
Security cabin.

41:53.679 --> 41:54.813
Let me go.

41:54.813 --> 41:56.782
I can walk this off.

41:56.782 --> 41:59.117
I can walk now.

41:59.117 --> 42:00.686
Just keep her alive.

42:04.522 --> 42:06.057
I can do that.

42:06.057 --> 42:07.826
You make sure he does.

42:48.366 --> 42:51.569
This man,
what is he like?

42:51.569 --> 42:52.638
Pure evil.

43:06.217 --> 43:08.019
What's that
around your neck?

43:12.123 --> 43:13.692
Nothing.

43:14.860 --> 43:15.994
You got family?

43:19.330 --> 43:20.966
Not anymore.

43:23.835 --> 43:25.370
I'm sorry.

43:28.707 --> 43:31.810
My job
is easier alone anyway.

43:34.379 --> 43:38.516
If it's easier alone,
why did you help us?

43:38.516 --> 43:39.885
Elda knew you would.

43:41.519 --> 43:43.354
She's done
her homework.

43:44.823 --> 43:47.025
She knows my past identities.

43:48.159 --> 43:51.162
After long enough,
your past lives become a rumor,

43:51.162 --> 43:52.798
legend even.

43:54.199 --> 43:57.235
And she's been around
long enough to hear them.

43:57.235 --> 43:59.070
So, you used to help people

43:59.070 --> 44:02.340
and then you stopped,
and now you're helping me?

44:07.212 --> 44:09.781
I'm just trying
to survive the night.

44:12.818 --> 44:14.319
Whatever you say.

45:42.207 --> 45:44.175
You need me, little one.

45:44.175 --> 45:45.844
You know you do.

45:49.380 --> 45:51.682
Drink this.

45:51.682 --> 45:53.251
Thanks.

45:53.251 --> 45:55.486
Don't fall asleep.

45:55.486 --> 45:58.489
You seem to be moving better.

46:00.625 --> 46:02.760
Got more guns.

46:02.760 --> 46:05.463
God, sit down.
Let me look at that.

46:05.463 --> 46:09.100
It's okay.
It's just a scratch.

46:10.468 --> 46:11.970
Jesus, Alexa.

46:11.970 --> 46:14.806
Alexa?
Is that your real name?

46:14.806 --> 46:17.575
For now. You?

46:17.575 --> 46:20.211
Scott, for now.

46:26.551 --> 46:30.321
Mission successful.
Except for a few mishaps.

46:30.321 --> 46:33.491
It's only
a small stab wound to the chest.

46:33.491 --> 46:35.793
The only thing
we need now is phones.

46:35.793 --> 46:37.662
The cloakroom.

46:37.662 --> 46:39.831
You able to function
on that leg now?

46:39.831 --> 46:41.466
I have to.

46:42.533 --> 46:44.102
Okay. Okay. I'm done.

46:44.102 --> 46:47.738
I'm done. That's cute.

46:47.738 --> 46:49.140
Yeah.

46:49.140 --> 46:52.410
Even when in the dirtiest
of waters,

46:52.410 --> 46:56.514
a lotus still produces
the most amazing flower.

46:56.514 --> 46:58.649
I love that.

46:58.649 --> 47:00.085
It's a symbol
of rebirth.

47:00.085 --> 47:02.753
Okay, okay,
I've got a sensitive side.

47:02.753 --> 47:04.422
We get it.

47:07.358 --> 47:08.326
Breathe.

47:08.326 --> 47:10.795
Is she okay?

47:10.795 --> 47:12.898
I'm fine.

47:12.898 --> 47:15.200
This time,
we stick together.

47:16.834 --> 47:19.537
Someone needs to make sure
you don't get stabbed.

47:21.372 --> 47:24.175
She's killed
three of our men

47:24.175 --> 47:27.312
to get to a signal jammer,
and there's no sign of the girl.

47:27.312 --> 47:30.081
So, what exactly
are you still doing out here?

47:30.081 --> 47:32.583
Useless morons.
I'm going in.

47:32.583 --> 47:35.153
The girl alive, Keates.

47:35.153 --> 47:37.422
Are you gonna make yourself
useful or what?

47:47.465 --> 47:49.334
I don't know about you but...

47:51.002 --> 47:54.539
...I think the time
for subtlety's over.

47:58.977 --> 48:02.547
He always needs
something big to hide behind.

48:19.497 --> 48:21.666
This place
is a bloody maze.

48:42.988 --> 48:44.355
Ugh.

48:53.031 --> 48:54.665
Who wants a job?

49:00.205 --> 49:02.940
Sorry.

49:21.993 --> 49:23.028
Go, go, go, go.

49:25.796 --> 49:27.365
Well, well, well.

49:30.035 --> 49:31.869
Come on!

49:33.838 --> 49:37.475
You see?
Fuck off subtlety

49:37.475 --> 49:42.647
and the universe will
open itself up to you.

49:48.386 --> 49:49.954
Fuck's sake.

49:56.361 --> 49:57.428
Thank you.

50:10.475 --> 50:12.277
Aaaahhh!

50:36.301 --> 50:38.403
Shit! Fucking bullets.

50:38.403 --> 50:40.037
Fucking thing.

51:31.689 --> 51:33.158
Grenade?

51:33.158 --> 51:36.927
Way too loud.
It'll blow the phones.

51:36.927 --> 51:38.129
I have smoke.

51:38.129 --> 51:40.598
Of course, you have.

51:40.598 --> 51:42.467
One bullet left.

51:47.205 --> 51:49.440
You stay here.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.342
You, with me.

53:18.463 --> 53:19.830
- Fuck.
- Hah!

53:19.830 --> 53:23.100
I told you!

53:23.100 --> 53:25.636
What'd I tell you?
Don't fuck with me.

53:25.636 --> 53:27.171
- Just doing anything.
- Egh!

53:27.171 --> 53:28.973
Aah!

53:28.973 --> 53:30.541
What the fuck!

53:33.844 --> 53:35.513
Yeah, scream.

53:35.513 --> 53:37.515
Pretty little thing, ain't you?

53:37.515 --> 53:39.016
Show me your teeth.

53:39.016 --> 53:40.485
Hold still.

53:41.652 --> 53:42.787
Scott!

53:42.787 --> 53:45.155
They said they wanted you alive,

53:45.155 --> 53:48.092
but they didn't say nothing
about your teeth.

53:55.500 --> 54:01.005
Eeeny... meeny... miny... moe.

54:01.005 --> 54:02.307
Aaaaghh!

54:05.676 --> 54:09.447
- Fucker.
- Aaah.

54:25.930 --> 54:27.532
Walker.

54:31.602 --> 54:33.471
He's not breathing.

54:33.471 --> 54:35.406
Scott? No.

54:35.406 --> 54:38.108
- Scott?
- Come on, you big lug.

54:38.108 --> 54:39.577
Fight.

54:39.577 --> 54:41.346
You can't let this beat you!

54:41.346 --> 54:45.015
Fight!

54:45.015 --> 54:46.484
Fight!

54:51.356 --> 54:52.823
Daddy...

54:58.363 --> 55:01.766
Are you two okay?

55:01.766 --> 55:05.370
Never better.

55:06.937 --> 55:10.174
Slow down, cowboy.
You need to take it easy.

55:11.542 --> 55:15.813
No time.

55:21.986 --> 55:24.221
Thank you.

55:32.497 --> 55:33.631
Speak.

55:33.631 --> 55:36.333
The compound's been sieged.

55:36.333 --> 55:39.437
I need two cars now.

55:39.437 --> 55:41.138
One hour.

55:45.175 --> 55:47.778
We need to lay low
for one hour.

55:47.778 --> 55:48.979
An hour?

55:50.981 --> 55:52.282
We can lay low for an hour.

55:52.282 --> 55:53.684
I wonder if this place
has got some whisky.

55:53.684 --> 55:55.152
We need to find
somewhere to hide.

55:55.152 --> 55:56.320
We need our documents.

55:56.320 --> 55:57.655
What?

56:04.862 --> 56:06.831
It's back in the other building.

56:06.831 --> 56:08.999
Why didn't we think
about this before?

56:08.999 --> 56:11.135
They may not even be made.

56:11.135 --> 56:14.539
We have to try.
She has to disappear today.

56:16.541 --> 56:17.875
Let's go.

56:24.482 --> 56:26.050
Can't hide forever.

56:29.554 --> 56:31.321
You okay?

56:33.323 --> 56:34.825
I hope so.

56:34.825 --> 56:36.293
Come on!

56:41.999 --> 56:44.001
You hide behind there.

56:44.001 --> 56:45.570
What you gonna do?

56:45.570 --> 56:47.938
- Come on.
- I'll grab his attention.

56:47.938 --> 56:51.008
When he come, you go.

56:51.008 --> 56:52.843
You're injured.
Have you seen that guy?

56:52.843 --> 56:54.178
I'll be fine.

56:56.547 --> 56:57.882
I'll see you.

57:07.492 --> 57:08.993
Gotcha.

57:36.220 --> 57:37.855
I know you're in here...

57:43.694 --> 57:48.699
And I know you're protecting
that pretty little thing.

57:54.204 --> 57:58.676
Have no doubt, I'm gonna
break your fucking neck.

58:00.110 --> 58:01.812
And not because of the money
they've offered me.

58:01.812 --> 58:03.981
No. It's more than that.

58:03.981 --> 58:05.349
I remember you.

58:08.318 --> 58:09.286
I've been waiting for this.

58:09.286 --> 58:11.155
Aaaahh!

58:25.369 --> 58:27.337
As long as you live,

58:27.337 --> 58:29.373
there'll always be
something waiting.

58:44.922 --> 58:46.023
Painful.

58:54.298 --> 58:55.800
Fuck.

58:57.101 --> 58:59.336
Go find the documents.

59:02.172 --> 59:03.273
And hide.

59:23.828 --> 59:25.730
Painful.

59:25.730 --> 59:27.164
Hell yeah.

59:43.013 --> 59:44.214
Run!

59:50.320 --> 59:51.355
Hah!

1:00:22.887 --> 1:00:25.022
You're gonna love this.

1:00:54.451 --> 1:00:56.553
Fuck.

1:01:19.043 --> 1:01:21.345
Much better.

1:01:21.345 --> 1:01:22.813
Now, my dear,

1:01:24.882 --> 1:01:27.651
I know it sounds cliché

1:01:27.651 --> 1:01:29.754
but there really is

1:01:29.754 --> 1:01:32.890
a hard way or an easy way.

1:01:50.107 --> 1:01:51.375
Right.

1:01:54.979 --> 1:01:56.146
Suit yourself.

1:02:00.217 --> 1:02:05.322
Now before I dispatch you,

1:02:05.322 --> 1:02:07.657
make yourself useful.

1:02:07.657 --> 1:02:10.027
The girl, where is she?

1:02:16.967 --> 1:02:19.036
The old double back, ey?

1:03:19.529 --> 1:03:21.531
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

1:03:25.169 --> 1:03:27.471
Oh, sweet Juliet.

1:03:27.471 --> 1:03:30.440
I won't hurt you. Promise.

1:03:48.258 --> 1:03:50.995
It seems
you're wounded, little one.

1:03:50.995 --> 1:03:53.030
Wouldn't want to hurt
the baby now, would you?

1:04:21.959 --> 1:04:23.693
Wherefore art thou?

1:04:43.380 --> 1:04:46.483
All right, princess.
Playtime's over.

1:05:02.099 --> 1:05:04.101
Aaahh!

1:05:38.868 --> 1:05:41.005
You know,
he might even let you go

1:05:42.106 --> 1:05:44.441
once he's ripped that creature
out of you.

1:06:23.547 --> 1:06:26.283
She's my baby.

1:06:48.138 --> 1:06:49.839
Now, you choose.

1:06:52.709 --> 1:06:55.445
The easy way or the hard way?

1:06:56.613 --> 1:06:59.015
I...I choose--

1:07:08.992 --> 1:07:10.427
I chose for you.

1:07:38.755 --> 1:07:40.657
I'm sure they won't mind
a few scratches.

1:08:12.689 --> 1:08:15.024
the innocent suffers.

1:08:33.042 --> 1:08:36.045
You were
doing this for me.

1:08:39.816 --> 1:08:44.354
Smithee. I guess
I've been here enough.

1:09:00.870 --> 1:09:02.939
You didn't deserve this.

1:09:05.275 --> 1:09:06.510
None of you.

1:09:12.216 --> 1:09:14.584
You found them.

1:09:14.584 --> 1:09:19.155
Only mine.
I guess she only found yours.

1:09:20.290 --> 1:09:21.625
We have to find her.

1:09:23.527 --> 1:09:24.594
What you doing?

1:09:32.001 --> 1:09:34.838
Ah, I see.

1:09:37.307 --> 1:09:38.275
There I was thinking...

1:09:38.275 --> 1:09:41.311
There will be a car
for you outside.

1:09:41.311 --> 1:09:42.779
After everything...

1:09:46.283 --> 1:09:48.184
No attachment.

1:09:49.353 --> 1:09:50.854
Number one rule.

1:09:50.854 --> 1:09:51.988
I know about your past.

1:09:51.988 --> 1:09:53.056
You know nothing!

1:09:53.056 --> 1:09:54.791
I know what happened.

1:09:58.194 --> 1:10:03.166
Your little girl's mother,
killed in a revenge shooting

1:10:03.166 --> 1:10:06.370
because you got those hostages
out of Yemen.

1:10:07.537 --> 1:10:08.738
You were trying to do
the right thing

1:10:08.738 --> 1:10:11.174
and you were punished.

1:10:11.174 --> 1:10:12.342
But there comes a time--

1:10:12.342 --> 1:10:13.677
Time for what?

1:10:13.677 --> 1:10:15.845
My little girl
will never be safe

1:10:15.845 --> 1:10:18.948
if I'm not dead to her.

1:10:18.948 --> 1:10:21.651
That's how we survive.

1:10:21.651 --> 1:10:23.487
No attachment.

1:10:26.956 --> 1:10:29.926
You will find out one day.

1:10:32.696 --> 1:10:34.831
Go fuck yourself.

1:10:41.305 --> 1:10:43.039
Urgh!

1:12:05.221 --> 1:12:06.956
No, no, no.

1:12:34.117 --> 1:12:35.118
Ugh!

1:12:42.426 --> 1:12:43.927
One bullet left.

1:12:45.962 --> 1:12:47.697
Story of my life.

1:12:58.341 --> 1:12:59.543
About bloody time.

1:13:00.677 --> 1:13:03.346
And why is she bleeding?

1:13:03.346 --> 1:13:05.782
She better not be hurt, Keates,

1:13:05.782 --> 1:13:07.150
or it's both our heads.

1:13:08.384 --> 1:13:11.020
Oh, thank you, Keates,
for saving the day

1:13:11.020 --> 1:13:13.723
when all the pathetic boys
went and got themselves killed.

1:13:15.625 --> 1:13:17.260
They couldn't pick up
a girl in a bar.

1:13:19.328 --> 1:13:20.329
Come on.

1:13:24.200 --> 1:13:25.334
Open up.

1:13:25.334 --> 1:13:26.936
Argh!

1:13:26.936 --> 1:13:28.605
Fucking morons.

1:13:33.109 --> 1:13:34.377
Careful.

1:14:03.306 --> 1:14:05.241
Not bad.

1:14:05.241 --> 1:14:06.776
You're gonna watch this.

1:14:15.885 --> 1:14:17.386
Fucking hell.

1:14:41.611 --> 1:14:42.612
Aagh!

1:15:49.478 --> 1:15:51.314
You need to stay down.

1:16:08.497 --> 1:16:10.399
Eeeeegghhh!

1:16:10.399 --> 1:16:12.268
Not today, sweetheart.

1:16:17.473 --> 1:16:18.775
Fuck!

1:16:18.775 --> 1:16:20.677
I'll take you both on
one-handed [indistinct]--

1:16:38.427 --> 1:16:41.364
Mm.

1:16:42.832 --> 1:16:45.234
Are you both okay?

1:16:45.234 --> 1:16:47.103
I hope so.

1:16:58.047 --> 1:17:00.049
He won't stop
looking for us, will he?

1:17:05.889 --> 1:17:07.891
You need to
get out of here.

1:17:09.358 --> 1:17:10.326
I couldn't find
your paperwork.

1:17:10.326 --> 1:17:12.829
I'm really sorry.

1:17:12.829 --> 1:17:14.530
Our friend had them.

1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:20.103
I'll be back in two minutes.

1:17:59.342 --> 1:18:01.477
You need this more than I do.

1:18:04.380 --> 1:18:05.548
Thank you.

1:19:00.603 --> 1:19:03.172
Get yourself
cleaned up.

1:19:03.172 --> 1:19:05.775
I have a job for you.

1:19:10.346 --> 1:19:12.782
There's something else I have to
do first.

1:19:50.186 --> 1:19:51.420
Oops.

1:19:51.420 --> 1:19:52.655
What?

1:19:52.655 --> 1:19:55.224
Quick. She's kicking.

1:20:00.830 --> 1:20:02.698
Even she doesn't want you to go.

1:20:06.602 --> 1:20:08.471
It's not over for me.

1:20:10.439 --> 1:20:12.175
But it can be.

1:20:18.848 --> 1:20:22.986
There are girls out
there like you and that's on me.

1:20:24.553 --> 1:20:27.156
If they're still alive,
I have to try.

1:20:35.364 --> 1:20:36.699
Will you visit?

1:20:39.702 --> 1:20:41.037
Maybe.

1:20:54.884 --> 1:20:56.352
I'll break down every door,

1:20:56.352 --> 1:20:58.587
I'll smash in every skull
until she's recovered.

1:20:58.587 --> 1:21:01.490
For that, you have
my fucking word!

1:21:09.765 --> 1:21:10.900
The guests are all here.

1:21:10.900 --> 1:21:12.235
Stop hiding.

1:21:12.235 --> 1:21:15.972
I'm not hiding.
I'll be down in a minute...

1:21:15.972 --> 1:21:18.374
I have a business to run.

1:21:28.851 --> 1:21:29.986
You'll be sorry
you tried this,

1:21:29.986 --> 1:21:31.120
you chicken shit!

1:21:32.488 --> 1:21:33.489
Who you working for?

1:21:33.489 --> 1:21:35.891
I hired, fired, and murdered
ten of your kind

1:21:35.891 --> 1:21:36.926
before breakfast!

1:22:14.163 --> 1:22:15.264
Do you mind?

1:22:34.050 --> 1:22:36.885
Cuban, very nice.

1:22:41.057 --> 1:22:42.225
Who sent you?

1:22:44.193 --> 1:22:46.162
Who you working for?

1:22:55.338 --> 1:22:56.972
Big mistake.

1:22:58.374 --> 1:22:59.942
Getting attached.

1:23:04.613 --> 1:23:06.582
I thought you knew better.

1:23:06.582 --> 1:23:11.687
And what are you doing here
then?

1:23:11.687 --> 1:23:14.623
She can't be paying you.

1:23:14.623 --> 1:23:17.260
You think you're special.

1:23:17.260 --> 1:23:22.998
You think you're righteous.
You're no different from me.

1:23:22.998 --> 1:23:26.169
You're no different
from the rest of us.

1:23:26.169 --> 1:23:29.105
What you doing here

1:23:29.105 --> 1:23:35.678
if not for some
disillusioned attachment?

1:23:36.979 --> 1:23:38.614
We're the same.

1:23:46.122 --> 1:23:48.224
No. We're not.

1:23:49.525 --> 1:23:51.827
You're scumbag.

1:23:51.827 --> 1:23:52.995
I'm making sure
she doesn't have to

1:23:52.995 --> 1:23:55.030
look over her shoulder again.

1:23:58.301 --> 1:23:59.702
Who are you?

1:24:05.108 --> 1:24:06.109
I'm nobody.
