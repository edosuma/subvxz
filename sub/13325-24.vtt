WEBVTT

00:01.534 --> 00:03.602
This study proposes
to show that people

00:03.604 --> 00:05.437
In "friends with
benefits" arrangements

00:05.439 --> 00:08.607
Are as happy as those
in traditional monogamous
relationships.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.609
And we'll examine
the sustainability

00:10.611 --> 00:13.012
Of nontraditional
relationships.

00:13.014 --> 00:15.781
Yeah, let me think about it.
Maybe we'll tuck it in
on the second draft.

00:15.783 --> 00:17.683
Why don't you just say
you don't want to put it in?

00:17.685 --> 00:20.753
Okay, I don't
want to put it in.

00:20.755 --> 00:23.055
Okay, then put this in.

00:23.057 --> 00:25.157
You're a bossy
little snot pants.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.793
( sighs )
it's a press release,
charlie.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.328
We don't want it
to get too wordy.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.363
Well, fine.
Bring it over here.
I'll type it.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.633
Oh, fine, I'll let
the 10,000 monkeys

00:34.635 --> 00:36.135
Take a crack at it.

00:39.339 --> 00:41.573
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:41.575 --> 00:44.076
"by kate wales, phd,
and charles goodson"?

00:44.078 --> 00:46.311
It would've been nice
if you'd asked me before
putting your name first.

00:46.313 --> 00:48.313
I listed them
alphabetically.

00:48.315 --> 00:50.816
Goodson, wales?

00:50.818 --> 00:52.684
By first name.

00:52.686 --> 00:55.687
Charlie, kate.

00:55.689 --> 00:58.090
By degree.

00:58.092 --> 01:00.793
Masters, phd.

01:00.795 --> 01:03.796
No, d.
Doctorate.

01:03.798 --> 01:07.399
As in I have one
and you d-don't.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.435
There it is, the one millionth
mention of doctorate.

01:09.437 --> 01:10.702
<i>Johnny, let's tell her</i>
<i>what she's won.</i>

01:10.704 --> 01:14.473
A congratulatory pat on
the back delivered by herself.

01:14.475 --> 01:17.309
You are so blowing this
way out of proportion.

01:17.311 --> 01:20.345
I'm just tired of you
throwing your degree
in my face.

01:20.347 --> 01:22.848
What's the big deal?
You wrote a dissertation.

01:22.850 --> 01:27.152
So did dr. Dre,
I assume.

01:27.154 --> 01:29.421
Hey, I am very proud
of my dissertation.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.823
It is a huge
accomplishment,

01:30.825 --> 01:33.725
And as my esteemed colleague
dr. Dre would say,

01:33.727 --> 01:36.595
"stop drinking
the haterade, player."

01:39.499 --> 01:41.500
Heyo.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.702
Wow, that's a change.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.204
You're bringing
food over now?

01:45.206 --> 01:47.306
Yeah, well, I'm always
eating your snacks,

01:47.308 --> 01:48.674
So I figure
the least I can do

01:48.676 --> 01:50.576
Is bring you
a bag of chips.

01:50.578 --> 01:51.877
Mm-hmm.

01:54.180 --> 01:56.348
- Would you
like some?
- Oh.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.616
You got any dip?

01:59.385 --> 02:01.386
I'm sorry,
it's not you,
it's kate.

02:01.388 --> 02:03.422
She wants to
control everything
in this sex study.

02:03.424 --> 02:05.290
Well, that kinda
makes sense.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.825
I mean, she is the one
with the doctorate.

02:06.827 --> 02:10.329
( crunching )

02:15.568 --> 02:18.470
Wow, you are angry.

02:18.472 --> 02:21.773
You know, it might be
a good time to find
a new shrink

02:21.775 --> 02:24.877
Now that you've
stopped seeing kate.

02:24.879 --> 02:26.678
I don't need a shrink.

02:26.680 --> 02:27.913
I've been in therapy
for over a year

02:27.915 --> 02:29.481
And I think I've got
things under control.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.782
I don't know, man.

02:30.784 --> 02:33.285
When you don't see a shrink,
you get all surly.

02:33.287 --> 02:35.888
And you stop buying
the good dip.

02:35.890 --> 02:38.524
Then everyone suffers.

02:40.460 --> 02:43.328
I don't need a therapist.
I've got my tools
for disengaging.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.596
Yeah, but don't you think
at some point--

02:44.598 --> 02:46.932
End of discussion,
snack whore!

02:47.867 --> 02:50.602
Way to use your tools.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.738
And I am not
a snack whore.

02:52.740 --> 02:55.541
I'm a hungry man
that's made a few mistakes.

02:56.943 --> 02:59.211
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

03:00.947 --> 03:04.349
Okay, before ed gets here,
you know that monthly dinner

03:04.351 --> 03:06.351
Charlie told us to do
as a bonding exercise?

03:06.353 --> 03:08.854
The one we bonded over
deciding never to do?

03:08.856 --> 03:12.257
But tomorrow night,
we're really doing it.

03:12.259 --> 03:15.627
I already told ed,
and you guys do not
wanna miss it.

03:15.629 --> 03:18.463
I am finally gonna
get even with him.

03:18.465 --> 03:19.898
For all those
indian slurs

03:19.900 --> 03:21.533
Like calling me
a "taj mawhore"?

03:21.535 --> 03:24.369
Yeah, and calling me
a lazy stoner?

03:24.371 --> 03:26.705
I've been meaning
to talk to him about that

03:26.707 --> 03:29.208
But I never seem
to get around to it.

03:29.210 --> 03:31.243
Yeah, for all of that,
but more importantly,

03:31.245 --> 03:33.612
For all the crap
he's thrown at me.

03:33.614 --> 03:36.782
I mean, "taj mahomo"?

03:36.784 --> 03:37.916
10 minutes after
he said it to you.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.586
I mean,
it's just sloppy.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.955
So, what are we
gonna do, kill him?

03:45.825 --> 03:47.226
No.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.864
I'm gonna make him think
he won the lottery.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.399
How?

03:54.401 --> 03:56.535
I'm buying everybody
lottery tickets,

03:56.537 --> 04:00.405
But for ed, I'm gonna pick
last week's winning numbers.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.908
And then we're gonna
all watch a recording
of last week's drawing

04:02.910 --> 04:05.978
And ed will think
we're watching it live.

04:05.980 --> 04:09.348
Oh, my god.
We should so do that
to nolan, too.

04:11.884 --> 04:13.785
He's standing
right next to you.

04:13.787 --> 04:16.288
It doesn't matter.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.758
Oh, hi, ed.

04:21.694 --> 04:22.894
What's your deal?

04:22.896 --> 04:26.498
You're smiling
like the "homona lisa."

04:26.500 --> 04:30.302
( laughs )
oh, yay.

04:32.872 --> 04:35.340
Hey, everybody.
What's so exciting?

04:35.342 --> 04:37.042
Oh, nothing.
We're just looking forward

04:37.044 --> 04:40.012
To our group bonding
dinner tomorrow night.

04:40.014 --> 04:42.047
Oh, you mean the one
you always pretend to have,

04:42.049 --> 04:44.349
But never do?

04:44.351 --> 04:46.385
That's the one.

04:46.387 --> 04:49.921
But tomorrow night,
we're really gonna do it.

04:49.923 --> 04:52.357
- Well, good for you.
- And you, too.

04:52.359 --> 04:54.026
I just saw the press release
about the big sex study

04:54.028 --> 04:56.428
You and dr. Wales
are doing.

04:56.430 --> 04:59.564
Wait, what-- what?
The press release came out?

04:59.566 --> 05:01.967
Yeah.
I get google alerts
on everyone I know

05:01.969 --> 05:04.069
In case someone
becomes successful.

05:04.071 --> 05:07.506
I want to be able
to start hating them
right away.

05:08.941 --> 05:10.509
"the wales-goodson study."

05:10.511 --> 05:11.977
How interesting.

05:11.979 --> 05:15.981
She put out the press release
all by herself.

05:15.983 --> 05:19.685
How come her name's first?
Is she, like, the boss?

05:19.687 --> 05:22.354
No, it's alphabetical.

05:23.089 --> 05:25.657
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.559
I am fine.
I am absolutely fine.

05:27.561 --> 05:31.029
If you'll excuse me,
I have to send somebody
a text.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.999
It's not
what it looks like!

05:35.568 --> 05:36.735
Why aren't you
still in session?

05:36.737 --> 05:38.904
I'm shooting
a text to kate.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.605
And send!

05:40.607 --> 05:42.374
( clatters )

05:49.782 --> 05:52.050
Yeah, you don't need
a therapist.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.886
The button
was sticking.

05:57.790 --> 06:00.625
Charlie goodson,
my god.

06:00.627 --> 06:02.728
How long has it been,
12 years?

06:02.730 --> 06:06.898
You get more handsome
every time I see you.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.034
And you're taller
than me now.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.737
Yeah, I was 35 when I took
your class, dr. Murphy.

06:11.739 --> 06:14.139
I'm exactly
the same height.

06:14.141 --> 06:17.943
Best developmental
psychology class
I ever taught.

06:17.945 --> 06:20.445
That was a very
special group.

06:20.447 --> 06:22.748
Oh, except, you know,
that one boy

06:22.750 --> 06:25.450
Who went on to be
a serial killer.

06:25.452 --> 06:28.086
He used
what I taught him

06:28.088 --> 06:31.990
To evade the police
for many, many years.

06:31.992 --> 06:35.527
Now I feel better about
hitting my phone with a pan.

06:35.529 --> 06:36.828
Oh, charlie.

06:36.830 --> 06:39.798
Are you having those
anger issues again?

06:39.800 --> 06:41.867
Well, that's
why I'm here.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.769
And I respect you
as an academic

06:43.771 --> 06:46.438
And I know you
have great connections
throughout the university.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.939
I thought maybe you
could refer me to someone.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.908
I'd be glad
to give you a name.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.544
But you should know
that I've gone back

06:52.546 --> 06:54.846
Into clinical
practice myself

06:54.848 --> 06:57.783
And I'm accepting
new patients.

06:57.785 --> 07:00.452
Oh, wow.
That's great.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.154
We could start
tomorrow.

07:02.156 --> 07:03.989
Well, if I could be honest,
I'm not sure I'm comfortable

07:03.991 --> 07:05.891
Talking to
someone your age

07:05.893 --> 07:08.026
About, you know,
everything.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.462
I was in a relationship
that was very complicated

07:10.464 --> 07:13.799
And post-cold war.

07:13.801 --> 07:16.568
- Try me.
- Okay.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.904
It was a noncommittal,
purely sexual,

07:18.906 --> 07:21.473
Friends-with-benefits
relationship

07:21.475 --> 07:23.575
With my last therapist.

07:23.577 --> 07:24.876
And now--

07:24.878 --> 07:26.711
Now we're conducting
a sex study together.

07:26.713 --> 07:30.182
Oh, my.

07:30.184 --> 07:33.118
That's almost as complicated
as my last patient,

07:33.120 --> 07:36.455
Who was in a polyamorous,
sadomasochistic,

07:36.457 --> 07:39.124
Bisexual relationship
with the other members

07:39.126 --> 07:42.761
Of his journey
tribute band.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.496
Wow.

07:44.498 --> 07:47.132
But he didn't
stop believing.

07:47.134 --> 07:50.135
And you
shouldn't either.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.970
Well, the music
reference is dated,

07:51.972 --> 07:53.939
But you seem current
on your dysfunctional
relationship stuff,

07:53.941 --> 07:56.208
So, yeah, let's
give it a shot.

07:56.210 --> 07:57.909
Great.

07:57.911 --> 08:00.979
- How's wednesdays at 2:00?
- I'll see you then.

08:00.981 --> 08:04.850
Oh, you're not leaving
without a sweater.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.518
I'm just gonna walk
right out of the car.

08:06.520 --> 08:07.953
No, you're
not leaving, mister,

08:07.955 --> 08:09.154
Until you
put something on.

08:09.156 --> 08:12.891
- Well, here.
- Really, I'm fine.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.693
Just take it.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.928
Now, you call me
when you get home

08:16.930 --> 08:20.098
So that I know that
you made it all right.

08:24.103 --> 08:26.004
Well, that was
tasty, patrick.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.806
Thank you, ed.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.674
Although I'm surprised
you went with the pasta.

08:29.676 --> 08:34.112
I figured you'd go
with the rump roast.

08:35.681 --> 08:38.149
Well, on that note...

08:38.151 --> 08:41.920
I have a surprise
before dessert.

08:41.922 --> 08:44.623
I bought everyone
lottery tickets.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.227
I'm not even
gonna look at it.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.795
Lottery's a sucker game.

08:50.797 --> 08:53.665
Besides that, I've already
won the lottery.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.067
I'm a white
american male.

08:56.069 --> 09:00.572
But, ed, you always say
the white american male

09:00.574 --> 09:02.807
Is the most oppressed
ethnic group in...

09:02.809 --> 09:05.877
( with southern accent )
"these here United States
of mexico."

09:05.879 --> 09:07.646
All right,
I'll look at it.

09:07.648 --> 09:11.049
All right, now let's
just turn on the tv.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.685
Oh, perfect.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.153
They're about
to announce the numbers.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.622
Man on tv:
<i>I guess now we know</i>
<i>what not to do</i>

09:17.624 --> 09:19.124
<i>When you find</i>
<i>a chimp in your car.</i>

09:19.126 --> 09:20.892
<i>( man on tv chuckles )</i>

09:20.894 --> 09:23.128
<i>And now</i>
<i>for tonight's lotto.</i>

09:23.130 --> 09:26.932
<i>We've got a big one tonight.</i>
<i>$42 million.</i>

09:26.934 --> 09:29.301
- Oh, that's a lot.
- <i>And the winning</i>
<i>numbers are...</i>

09:29.303 --> 09:31.102
<i>Four...</i>

09:31.104 --> 09:33.672
<i>15...</i>

09:33.674 --> 09:35.006
<i>Eight...</i>

09:35.008 --> 09:37.142
<i>23...</i>

09:37.144 --> 09:38.643
<i>16...</i>

09:38.645 --> 09:40.879
<i>And here's</i>
<i>the last number...</i>

09:40.881 --> 09:41.980
- Hey, patrick?
- Hmm?

09:41.982 --> 09:45.283
Doesn't mean I have to split
this with you, does it?

09:45.285 --> 09:49.354
Oh, no, you don't.
All the money would be yours.

09:49.356 --> 09:52.958
Man on tv:
<i>And 42.</i>

09:52.960 --> 09:54.960
<i>( tv clicks )</i>

09:54.962 --> 09:56.695
So, how'd
everybody do?

09:56.697 --> 09:58.997
- I lost.
- Me, too.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.999
What about you, ed?

10:01.001 --> 10:03.835
I'm a goddamn
millionaire.

10:04.870 --> 10:07.105
You can all
kiss my ass,

10:07.107 --> 10:09.641
If you can catch it.
I'm buying a jet ski

10:09.643 --> 10:11.943
And riding it all the way
to branson, missouri.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.012
Out of my way,
peasants.

10:21.921 --> 10:25.156
You're gonna call
him tonight, right?

10:25.158 --> 10:26.758
Well, of course I am.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.628
Anybody have his number?
Oh, no, well, we tried.

10:33.065 --> 10:34.733
Kate, did you call
the police?

10:34.735 --> 10:35.867
What? Why?

10:35.869 --> 10:39.638
And released
the press statement that
we were gonna do together.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.906
I'm sorry, charlie.

10:41.908 --> 10:43.708
The university called
and said they needed it
immediately.

10:43.710 --> 10:45.143
I didn't know what to do.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.811
Yes, it must have been
terribly confusing.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.880
Should I call charlie?
Should I not call charlie?

10:48.882 --> 10:51.916
I mean, that decision
alone would've cost you
valuable seconds.

10:51.918 --> 10:55.120
I get it.
But somebody has to take
the lead on this paper,

10:55.122 --> 10:57.022
And I know you hate
hearing this--

10:57.024 --> 10:59.124
If you say
the word "doctorate"
or "dissertation,"

10:59.126 --> 11:01.726
I swear to god
I will feed you
through your own juicer.

11:01.728 --> 11:05.330
Okay, I should take
the lead on this paper

11:05.332 --> 11:07.098
Because I wrote
a big, smart thing

11:07.100 --> 11:08.900
And I got a big,
smart certificate,

11:08.902 --> 11:11.236
And you should
understand that, you...

11:11.238 --> 11:13.138
Big, smart man, you.

11:15.175 --> 11:19.310
You have control issues
that you need to work on
with a therapist.

11:19.312 --> 11:20.912
I'll work on my issues
with mine.

11:20.914 --> 11:24.916
- Anyone I know?
- As a matter of fact,
I think you do.

11:24.918 --> 11:27.185
- Remember dr. Murphy?
- You're kidding, right?

11:27.187 --> 11:30.155
Charlie, that woman
is not in her prime.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.257
Her kids are not
in their prime.

11:34.226 --> 11:37.095
She was a therapist
for 25 years before
she started teaching.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.463
She studied with erikson.
The woman is brilliant.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.231
I'm not saying
she's not brilliant,

11:40.233 --> 11:42.133
But don't you think
she's a little soft?

11:42.135 --> 11:43.735
Well, there's nothing wrong
with a therapist

11:43.737 --> 11:46.438
Who's warm and nurturing
and doesn't scare babies.

11:46.440 --> 11:49.140
Okay, that baby
was skittish.

11:50.109 --> 11:52.844
I know what's
going on here.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.846
- You're jealous.
- Jealous of what?

11:54.848 --> 11:57.482
My new therapist
and the fact that she may
turn out to be better than you.

11:57.484 --> 12:00.085
No, what's going on here
is that you want a therapist

12:00.087 --> 12:01.720
Who doesn't call you out
on your crap.

12:01.722 --> 12:04.022
What you want
is a mommy.

12:04.024 --> 12:06.791
Oh, that's ridiculous.
I don't want my mommy.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.960
I said "a mommy."

12:08.962 --> 12:12.263
I'd better go talk
to my new therapist about that.

12:14.266 --> 12:16.367
She is just
driving me crazy.

12:16.369 --> 12:19.471
I don't know where
my anger issues begin
and her narcissism ends.

12:19.473 --> 12:21.239
Oh, you poor thing.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.141
You're still blaming
your anger on other people.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.810
That's not
what this is about.

12:25.812 --> 12:31.282
You know what you need?
A nice bowl of hot oatmeal.

12:33.085 --> 12:36.855
Uh, I think we have different
definitions of blocked.

12:36.857 --> 12:40.125
I've got instant
and I've got some
hot water here.

12:40.127 --> 12:43.828
Mm, apple cinnamon.

12:43.830 --> 12:47.132
Thank you, dr. Murphy,
but I'm really not hungry.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.367
( sighs )
well, are you tired?

12:49.369 --> 12:50.969
Maybe you should
take a little nap.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.203
You've got bags
under your eyes.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.973
Sit, now.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.142
Sit.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.110
Now you put your head
on my shoulder,

12:59.112 --> 13:00.779
Take a little
"shushie."

13:00.781 --> 13:02.547
- A "shushie"?
- Yeah.

13:02.549 --> 13:05.917
Just close your eyes
and relax

13:05.919 --> 13:10.054
For as long as you want.
I have all day.

13:10.056 --> 13:11.456
What about
your other patients?

13:11.458 --> 13:12.857
Don't worry
about them, dear.

13:12.859 --> 13:15.426
I don't have
any other patients.

13:16.462 --> 13:19.798
I'm sorry, sam, but we
are through talking
about belly rings.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.232
Mom, please,
I'm begging.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.201
I'm done talking
about this.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.537
I'm getting
the belly ring.

13:25.539 --> 13:27.972
Dad, will you
please talk to her?

13:27.974 --> 13:31.209
Why can't you
just get giant fake boobs
like a normal mom?

13:31.211 --> 13:33.278
You know what?
That might be nice...

13:33.280 --> 13:34.913
With my belly ring.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.815
Why? Why?

13:41.253 --> 13:44.422
Whoa, a $600
speeding ticket?

13:44.424 --> 13:47.492
What did you do,
cut through a playground?

13:47.494 --> 13:50.128
No, 30 in a 25.

13:50.130 --> 13:53.364
Then the cop asked
why I was being pulled over
and I said,

13:53.366 --> 13:56.868
"'cause it's easier than
tracking down real criminals?"

13:56.870 --> 13:58.303
And then, for some reason,

13:58.305 --> 14:00.872
It just went downhill
after that.

14:00.874 --> 14:03.007
You having
anger problems again?

14:03.009 --> 14:04.843
Sort of.

14:04.845 --> 14:06.411
I overslept
at my new therapist's

14:06.413 --> 14:08.179
And I was late
for an appointment with kate,

14:08.181 --> 14:09.981
So she made another
big decision without me.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.182
Wait, go back.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.251
You were sleeping
at your therapist's?

14:13.253 --> 14:15.186
And you pay for this?

14:15.188 --> 14:17.121
I'm gonna go out
and buy a bunch of futons

14:17.123 --> 14:19.290
And open up
a mental health center.

14:20.392 --> 14:21.860
It's just not gonna
work out with this woman

14:21.862 --> 14:23.428
And I don't know
how to tell her.

14:23.430 --> 14:26.264
Well, you just say what I said
when I broke up with you.

14:26.266 --> 14:29.100
"I'm sorry, but I no longer
require your services."

14:29.102 --> 14:31.402
It's not that easy.
She's in her 80s.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.004
If I quit going,
there's nothing in her future

14:33.006 --> 14:36.241
Except an empty room
and a shower with
a chair in it.

14:36.243 --> 14:37.909
Oh, well, you're stuck.

14:37.911 --> 14:40.078
My gynecologist is 95.

14:40.080 --> 14:43.481
Sometimes I think
my visits are the only thing
keeping him alive.

14:45.317 --> 14:47.318
Has anybody heard
from ed yet?

14:47.320 --> 14:48.987
He must be really upset.

14:48.989 --> 14:51.122
I know, isn't this fun?

14:51.124 --> 14:54.525
I wish I could've
seen his face when he tried
to cash in his ticket.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.628
I bet his eyebrows
were all scrunched

14:56.630 --> 14:59.364
And he was all frowny
and mad and...

14:59.366 --> 15:02.934
You know, pretty much
just his regular face.

15:04.370 --> 15:07.272
I did it.
I left my wife.

15:09.276 --> 15:15.013
Yeah, I wanted to be smart,
so after consulting
legalzoom.Com,

15:15.015 --> 15:16.948
I decided
to make the break

15:16.950 --> 15:19.384
Before she could claim
any of this baby.

15:19.386 --> 15:21.185
You didn't try
to cash it in yet?

15:21.187 --> 15:23.187
No, no.
I'm on my way to pick up
my winnings now.

15:23.189 --> 15:25.189
I just stopped by
to say good-bye

15:25.191 --> 15:27.191
And take a picture
of all of you

15:27.193 --> 15:30.128
Before I do
my island shopping.

15:32.031 --> 15:34.632
Ed, sit down.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.701
No, no, I don't need
therapy anymore.

15:36.703 --> 15:40.371
You know those people that say
"money can't buy happiness"?

15:40.373 --> 15:44.509
Well, those people
aren't welcome on my island.

15:44.511 --> 15:48.279
Ed, you didn't win.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.014
The ticket is fake.

15:50.016 --> 15:51.649
What are you
talking about?

15:51.651 --> 15:53.718
The numbers matched
the one on television.

15:53.720 --> 15:58.089
We showed you the recording
from last week's lottery.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.491
You were all
in on this?

16:00.493 --> 16:03.127
Well, patrick thought
it would be a funny joke.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.196
I tried desperately
to stop him.

16:05.198 --> 16:06.631
I'll never forget.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.399
When he told us
what he was going to do,

16:08.401 --> 16:10.601
He was standing
right here by this door.

16:12.438 --> 16:16.441
You thought
this would be funny?

16:16.443 --> 16:18.609
I left my wife.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.645
<i>I said horrible things.</i>

16:20.647 --> 16:23.114
I've got no place
to live.

16:23.116 --> 16:26.484
I-- I never meant
to hurt you.

16:26.486 --> 16:32.223
But I never meant
to do anything that would
make me feel bad.

16:35.294 --> 16:37.428
I made these last night.

16:37.430 --> 16:38.496
You'll like 'em.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.765
I used my secret
ingredient.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.633
Don't tell me, love?

16:42.635 --> 16:46.170
And a sprinkle
of understanding.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.373
Look, dr. Murphy...

16:48.375 --> 16:51.109
As much as I appreciate
the cookies

16:51.111 --> 16:53.478
And the oatmeal,
the naps,

16:53.480 --> 16:55.413
And all the other
nice things you do

16:55.415 --> 16:59.417
That make me feel
radically uncomfortable,

16:59.419 --> 17:01.419
I have to terminate
our therapy.

17:01.421 --> 17:02.754
All right, all right.

17:02.756 --> 17:06.324
I think I need to explain
what I've been doing.

17:06.326 --> 17:07.725
Trying to make me a big,
strong boy, I know.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.061
But my mother
already did that.

17:10.063 --> 17:13.331
No, it's not
about that, charlie.

17:13.333 --> 17:16.601
You have serious
trust issues,

17:16.603 --> 17:19.704
So I adopted
a maternal persona

17:19.706 --> 17:22.507
Based on freudian
oedipal techniques

17:22.509 --> 17:24.242
That I pioneered

17:24.244 --> 17:27.445
To help strengthen
your trust more quickly

17:27.447 --> 17:29.547
So that we could
move forward.

17:29.549 --> 17:32.250
Oh, my god.
That makes perfect sense.

17:32.252 --> 17:34.585
I can't wait to tell kate
about how wrong she was

17:34.587 --> 17:36.487
About you and I
not being a good fit.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.557
Kate wales. You probably
don't remember her.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.492
She was in one
of your classes
a long time ago.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.728
Oh, of course,
I remember kate wales.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.464
I advised her on her
doctoral dissertation.

17:46.466 --> 17:51.069
And I think I know
why she wouldn't want
you to see me.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.336
What do you mean?

17:52.338 --> 17:55.339
I'm not comfortable
saying this out loud,

17:55.341 --> 17:59.410
But frankly,
she may have...

18:00.512 --> 18:05.349
P-l-a-g-I-a-r-I-z-e-d.

18:05.351 --> 18:07.251
I got that she
"ized" something,

18:07.253 --> 18:09.821
I just--
I forgot the beginning.

18:09.823 --> 18:13.524
She plagiarized parts of
her doctoral dissertation.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.760
Oh, my god.
So you're saying
she cheated?

18:15.762 --> 18:17.595
That's awful.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.597
How about you hook me up
with a glass of milk

18:19.599 --> 18:21.365
For these cookies
and tell me everything?

18:24.536 --> 18:27.338
Sorry I'm late.
Did you see my note?

18:27.340 --> 18:30.174
Yes, I did.

18:30.176 --> 18:31.843
"had to run an errand.
Be back soon."

18:31.845 --> 18:36.247
You expect me to believe
you came up with this
by yourself?

18:36.249 --> 18:39.584
Did you fall down
in the bathroom?

18:39.586 --> 18:41.719
I don't know.

18:41.721 --> 18:44.322
Let's do some
cognitive tests.

18:44.324 --> 18:47.191
Ask me if I remember
what phd stands for.

18:47.193 --> 18:48.493
Oh, wait.
I know.

18:48.495 --> 18:51.162
"plagiarized
her dissertation."

18:51.164 --> 18:52.263
I guess I am okay.

18:52.265 --> 18:55.366
Actually, I'm much,
much better.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.568
All right,
I know what murphy said,

18:57.570 --> 18:59.504
And I knew she would
blow this out of proportion,

18:59.506 --> 19:01.272
- So let me explain.
- So you did plagiarize.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.807
That's why you didn't
want me to see her.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.775
That's not the only reason.
I mean, she's still ancient.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.377
If you took away
her support hose,

19:06.379 --> 19:08.179
Her legs would crumble
like blue cheese.

19:08.181 --> 19:10.715
I can't believe this.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.650
No, it is not
what you think.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.585
I was going through
a really bad time.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.220
My mom went off her meds

19:16.222 --> 19:17.655
And had to be
hospitalized again.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.658
It was two lousy
paragraphs about ethics.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.493
I know, the irony.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.695
Blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.597
Wow, wow.
You are really perceptive

19:26.599 --> 19:29.500
For someone who
may or may not be
a psychologist.

19:29.502 --> 19:32.670
I am a psychologist.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.506
It was only the first draft,
and as soon as I had a chance,

19:35.508 --> 19:38.543
I rewrote the whole thing
and the doctoral panel

19:38.545 --> 19:41.712
Said it was the best
dissertation they had read.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.514
Okay, okay,
I understand.

19:43.516 --> 19:46.350
I just need you to agree
that we're partners
on this study.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.519
- Equal partners.
- Fine.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.721
By the way, did I tell you
what phd stands for?

19:50.723 --> 19:52.323
Yes, charlie.

19:52.325 --> 19:54.525
Because I was really excited
when I came up with it.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.694
I had to pull
the car over.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.362
( chuckles )

19:59.898 --> 20:02.800
Listen, uh, I don't usually

20:02.802 --> 20:05.303
Do this kind of thing.

20:05.305 --> 20:08.239
And it's fine that you
stayed the night,

20:08.241 --> 20:11.842
But I have a really
busy day today, so...

20:11.844 --> 20:13.711
You should probably
go home now.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.413
'fraid not.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.417
Till my wife
takes me back,

20:19.419 --> 20:21.752
I'm living here
on your dime.

20:21.754 --> 20:24.322
Listen...

20:24.324 --> 20:27.325
Tonight I'm gonna need
you to turn me over

20:27.327 --> 20:29.660
About halfway
through the night.

20:29.662 --> 20:33.431
Otherwise I might drown
in my own saliva.

20:35.667 --> 20:38.469
( sighs )

20:38.471 --> 20:40.438
How are we
feeling today?

20:40.440 --> 20:41.439
Doing okay.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.541
But I'm a little confused.

20:43.543 --> 20:46.544
I feel like you kind of
misled me about the whole
kate wales thing.

20:46.546 --> 20:49.347
It was only two paragraphs
and she rewrote them.

20:49.349 --> 20:52.016
You know, charlie,
I don't think this
is about plagiarism.

20:52.018 --> 20:56.988
I think this is about trust
between you and me.

20:56.990 --> 21:00.958
And I think we should
reestablish our connection

21:00.960 --> 21:03.527
In a much
deeper way.

21:03.529 --> 21:05.763
You know, there are
some things

21:05.765 --> 21:08.933
Only a mother
can provide.

21:11.470 --> 21:13.504
Hey, you know what?
I think I'm cured.
