WEBVTT

00:02.900 --> 00:04.133
- OH, GREAT,
YOU'RE ALL HERE.

00:04.133 --> 00:07.867
- I WAS JUST
THINKING THAT MYSELF.

00:07.867 --> 00:09.200
- I HAVE SOME EXCITING NEWS.

00:09.200 --> 00:12.867
- YOUR BLUE OX CAME HOME?

00:12.867 --> 00:14.100
- [laughs]

00:14.100 --> 00:17.867
THAT'S FUNNY.

00:17.867 --> 00:19.033
I WAS GONNA SAY,

00:19.033 --> 00:20.567
"DR. FRANKENSTEIN
BUILT A BRIDE?"

00:20.567 --> 00:23.333
[laughs]

00:28.067 --> 00:29.700
- WHAT'S GOIN' ON,
ROBERT?

00:29.700 --> 00:32.533
- OKAY.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.833
I JUST GOT A CALL
FROM THE FBI.

00:35.833 --> 00:37.067
- THE FBI?
- OH, MY GOSH!

00:37.067 --> 00:38.933
- MY CAPTAIN
HAS CONNECTIONS THERE,

00:38.933 --> 00:40.300
AND HE RECOMMENDED ME.

00:40.300 --> 00:42.067
TODAY, SPECIAL AGENT
THOMAS GARFIELD CALLED

00:42.067 --> 00:43.433
TO SET UP A JOB INTERVIEW!

00:43.433 --> 00:46.233
- OH, ROBERT!
THAT IS FANTASTIC!

00:46.233 --> 00:47.700
- YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW,
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

00:47.700 --> 00:50.800
WE HAVE A MEETING
TOMORROW MORNING!

00:50.800 --> 00:51.867
THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.

00:51.867 --> 00:53.033
I'M GONNA GET A GOOD SHAVE,

00:53.033 --> 00:54.067
I'M GONNA PUT ON
MY LUCKY SUIT,

00:54.067 --> 00:55.700
AND MA, WHAT DO YOU SAY,

00:55.700 --> 00:57.800
I'LL COME OVER EARLY
AND YOU'LL MAKE ME BREAKFAST?

00:57.800 --> 01:00.633
YEAH, I'M THINKIN'
FUNNY-SHAPED PANCAKES.

01:00.633 --> 01:02.400
- OF COURSE, DEAR.

01:02.400 --> 01:04.200
I'M JUST SURPRISED
ABOUT ALL THIS.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.933
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
DO YOUR 20 YEARS

01:05.933 --> 01:07.133
AND THEN RETIRE.

01:07.133 --> 01:10.300
- YEAH, I KNOW, BUT MA,
THIS IS THE FBI!

01:10.300 --> 01:13.267
I MEAN, THIS IS LIKE
A WHOLE NEW PHASE IN MY LIFE.

01:13.267 --> 01:17.867
YOU KNOW,
"ROBERT BARONE, PART TWO."

01:17.867 --> 01:20.767
- "THIS TIME HE'S FATTER!"

01:20.767 --> 01:23.000
- [laughs]

01:28.533 --> 01:29.933
- GOOD PANCAKES.

01:29.933 --> 01:31.133
- YEAH.

01:31.133 --> 01:32.867
- JUICE?
- WHAT?

01:32.867 --> 01:33.900
- YOU GONNA
HAVE SOME JUICE?

01:33.900 --> 01:35.533
- OH. NO.

01:35.533 --> 01:37.400
- 'CAUSE I WAS JUST THINKIN'
YOU MIGHT WANT SOME

01:37.400 --> 01:39.367
BEFORE YOUR BIG
FBI INTERVIEW.

01:39.367 --> 01:42.933
- NO, ACTUALLY
I'M FEELIN' PRETTY GOOD.

01:42.933 --> 01:48.633
- GET ME SOME JUICE.

01:48.633 --> 01:49.900
- HERE YOU GO.

01:49.900 --> 01:51.967
- OH.
GREAT, MA.

01:51.967 --> 01:53.633
THANKS FOR IRONIN' THAT FOR ME.

01:53.633 --> 01:55.000
- OKAY.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.200
PUT THAT ON.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.733
AND PUT THIS TRENCHCOAT
ON OVER IT.

01:57.733 --> 01:58.933
- NAH, DON'T NEED IT.

01:58.933 --> 02:00.433
JUST MY LUCKY SUIT.

02:00.433 --> 02:02.267
- YES, BUT I THINK
YOU SHOULD WEAR THIS COAT,

02:02.267 --> 02:04.933
'CAUSE IT MAKES YOU LOOK
VERY FBI-ISH.

02:04.933 --> 02:06.233
- ALL RIGHT.

02:06.233 --> 02:08.900
- NO, NO, NO,
PUT IT ON NOW,

02:08.900 --> 02:10.200
SO YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.

02:10.200 --> 02:12.800
- COULD I FINISH
MY BREAKFAST FIRST?

02:12.800 --> 02:14.000
- SURE. SURE.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.900
- HOW ABOUT
MY JUICE?

02:15.900 --> 02:19.133
- ALL RIGHT.

02:21.833 --> 02:23.767
- HEY.

02:23.767 --> 02:25.867
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE BACK OF YOUR JACKET?

02:25.867 --> 02:27.967
- FRANK.
- WHAT?

02:27.967 --> 02:31.467
YOU GOT A BIG BURN MARK
ON THE BACK OF YOUR JACKET.

02:31.467 --> 02:32.600
- WHAT?

02:36.767 --> 02:39.100
OH, MY GOD!

02:39.100 --> 02:40.533
MA, WHAT HAPPENED?

02:40.533 --> 02:45.533
- I THINK THAT WAS
ALREADY THERE.

02:45.533 --> 02:46.967
- MA!

02:46.967 --> 02:49.567
- OKAY, I HAD THE TELEVISION ON,

02:49.567 --> 02:51.800
AND A COMMERCIAL FOR SOME
SPORTS PROGRAM CAME ON,

02:51.800 --> 02:54.033
AND IT SAID THAT RAYMOND
WAS GONNA BE ON IT.

02:54.033 --> 02:56.167
- OH, MY GOD!

02:56.167 --> 02:57.800
- BUT HE NEVER TOLD ME.

02:57.800 --> 03:00.833
AND I STARTED TO WONDER WHY
I HAVE TO HEAR ABOUT IT ON TV

03:00.833 --> 03:02.933
INSTEAD OF HIM TELLING ME.

03:02.933 --> 03:05.333
- SO YOU BURNED
MY LUCKY SUIT?

03:05.333 --> 03:06.800
- I WAS DISTRACTED!

03:06.800 --> 03:09.067
DID HE TELL YOU ANYTHING
ABOUT BEING ON A SPORTS PROGRAM?

03:09.067 --> 03:10.767
- WHO CARES?

03:10.767 --> 03:12.200
- DON'T YELL AT ME.

03:12.200 --> 03:15.167
THE PERSON WE SHOULD
BE UPSET WITH IS RAYMOND.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.867
- THIS WAS MY LUCKY SUIT!

03:20.867 --> 03:25.967
- WELL, I THINK YOU'RE
DOWN TO LUCKY PANTS.

03:25.967 --> 03:28.667
- WHAT HAPPENED, MA?

03:28.667 --> 03:30.933
HUH?
YOU RUINED MY LUCKY SUIT!

03:30.933 --> 03:32.300
THE MOST IMPORTANT
DAY OF MY LIFE!

03:32.300 --> 03:37.233
- HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE?

03:37.233 --> 03:38.567
- WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

03:38.567 --> 03:40.367
- WELL, YOU'RE GONNA GO
AND CHANGE.

03:40.367 --> 03:42.867
YOU DON'T NEED A LUCKY SUIT.
YOU'RE A WONDERFUL BOY.

03:42.867 --> 03:46.167
- AND YOU'RE A WONDERFUL IRONER.

03:46.167 --> 03:48.800
- THAT'S ENOUGH, FRANK.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.300
- NOW I GOT TO GO THROUGH
MY INTERVIEW IN AN UNLUCKY SUIT.

03:51.300 --> 03:52.800
- JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
WEARING YOUR LUCKY SUIT

03:52.800 --> 03:54.833
DOESN'T MEAN THAT
WHATEVER YOU DO WEAR

03:54.833 --> 03:56.000
WILL BE UNLUCKY.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.300
- LOOK AT MY LIFE.

03:58.300 --> 04:00.700
ALL MY OTHER CLOTHES
ARE UNLUCKY.

04:04.967 --> 04:06.933
- I FEEL TERRIBLE.

04:06.933 --> 04:10.633
- AW, IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

04:10.633 --> 04:11.967
LISTEN.

04:11.967 --> 04:14.100
GET ME SOME JUICE.

04:20.833 --> 04:23.400
- STUPID SUIT.

04:23.400 --> 04:27.300
I HATE YOU, I HATE YOU,
I HATE YOU!

04:27.300 --> 04:29.467
- GOOD MORNING.
- OH, GOOD MORNING.

04:29.467 --> 04:33.000
- SPECIAL AGENT GARFIELD.
- LIEUTENANT ROBERT BARONE.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.767
- WERE YOU JUST
SAYING SOMETHING?

04:35.767 --> 04:37.800
- NO.

04:37.800 --> 04:38.900
JUST SITTING HERE.

04:38.900 --> 04:40.667
QUIETLY.

04:40.667 --> 04:43.567
- YOU DIDN'T SAY,
"I HATE YOU, I HATE YOU"?

04:50.000 --> 04:51.367
- OH.

04:51.367 --> 04:54.267
NO.

04:54.267 --> 04:56.000
- WHY DON'T WE
GET STARTED?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.200
- ALL RIGHT.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.800
SO WHAT'S THAT,
MY PERMANENT RECORD?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.200
- YES.

05:04.733 --> 05:06.033
LET'S SEE.

05:06.033 --> 05:08.900
19 YEARS NYPD,

05:08.900 --> 05:10.100
NO DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS,

05:10.100 --> 05:12.100
11 COMMENDATIONS.
VERY NICE.

05:12.100 --> 05:14.667
- YES, THE COMMENDATIONS
ARE NICE.

05:14.667 --> 05:17.500
BUT REALLY, THE JOB
IS ITS OWN REWARD.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.000
- WELL,
THAT'S THE KIND OF ATTITUDE

05:19.000 --> 05:20.467
WE LOOK FOR AROUND HERE.

05:20.467 --> 05:22.133
IT'S ABOUT TEAMWORK,
BEING PART OF A TEAM.

05:22.133 --> 05:25.100
- YOUR WATER.
- OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

05:25.100 --> 05:27.100
- AND THIS FAX
CAME FOR YOU, SIR.

05:29.900 --> 05:31.667
- SO AS I WAS SAYING--

05:31.667 --> 05:33.033
- IS THIS A JOKE?

05:33.033 --> 05:34.733
- EXCUSE ME?

05:36.800 --> 05:38.867
- "DEAR FBI AGENT GARFIELD.

05:38.867 --> 05:41.433
"I'M WRITING TO ASK
FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING.

05:41.433 --> 05:43.967
"YOU HAVE AN INTERVIEW
THIS MORNING WITH MY SON,

05:43.967 --> 05:45.300
"ROBERT BARONE.

05:52.633 --> 05:55.767
"I THINK YOU WILL FIND ROBERT
TO BE AN EXCEPTIONAL CANDIDATE

05:55.767 --> 05:57.100
"FOR THE JOB.

05:57.100 --> 06:00.100
"HE IS HARDWORKING,
BRAVE, AND HANDSOME.

06:05.667 --> 06:08.500
"BUT I FEEL I HAVE
HURT HIS CHANCES SOMEWHAT.

06:08.500 --> 06:11.700
"YOU SEE,
HE HAS A LUCKY SUIT.

06:15.367 --> 06:17.667
"AND WHILE I WAS
IRONING THIS MORNING,

06:17.667 --> 06:18.767
"I RUINED IT.

06:18.767 --> 06:19.967
"HE WAS VERY UPSET,

06:19.967 --> 06:22.100
"SO HE MIGHT BE
A LITTLE DISTRACTED.

06:22.100 --> 06:24.933
"PLEASE DON'T
HOLD THIS AGAINST HIM.

06:24.933 --> 06:26.733
"IF ANYTHING, BLAME ME.

06:26.733 --> 06:29.333
"I DON'T MIND.
I'M USED TO IT.

06:32.033 --> 06:33.500
"OF COURSE,

06:33.500 --> 06:37.067
"IT'S ALSO MY OTHER SON
RAYMOND BARONE'S FAULT.

06:37.067 --> 06:38.933
"HE'S A FAMOUS SPORTSWRITER.

06:38.933 --> 06:41.033
"PERHAPS YOU'RE HEARD OF HIM.

06:41.033 --> 06:42.700
"BUT MOSTLY,
I'M TO BLAME.

06:42.700 --> 06:45.300
"I ONLY WANTED ROBERT
TO LOOK HIS BEST.

06:45.300 --> 06:47.100
"THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING.

06:47.100 --> 06:50.000
SINCERELY,
MARIE BARONE."

07:15.167 --> 07:16.567
- [clears throat]

07:16.567 --> 07:17.567
- "P.S."

07:17.567 --> 07:19.400
- OH, GOD.

07:21.100 --> 07:23.267
- "PLEASE ASK ROBERT
TO FORGIVE ME.

07:23.267 --> 07:26.667
"I TRIED, BUT IT'LL MEAN MORE
COMING FROM YOU."

07:31.833 --> 07:33.667
PLEASE FORGIVE YOUR MOTHER.

07:40.300 --> 07:42.900
- MOM, I DIDN'T
PURPOSELY NOT TELL YOU

07:42.900 --> 07:44.533
I WAS GONNA BE ON TV.

07:44.533 --> 07:45.700
I JUST FORGOT.

07:45.700 --> 07:48.333
- THEN MAYBE
I'LL JUST FORGET TO WATCH.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.100
- FINE, DON'T WATCH.

07:51.100 --> 07:52.867
- FINE, I WON'T.

07:52.867 --> 07:54.733
WHAT TIME IS IT ON?

07:56.000 --> 07:58.400
SO I'LL KNOW WHEN NOT TO WATCH.

08:08.833 --> 08:10.100
WHAT?
WHAT?

08:10.100 --> 08:12.767
[gasps]
OH!

08:12.767 --> 08:14.633
ROBBIE, YOU SCARED ME!

08:19.267 --> 08:21.767
HOW DID YOUR INTERVIEW GO?

08:21.767 --> 08:25.133
- COME HERE.
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT IT.

08:27.133 --> 08:28.933
- DIDN'T IT GO WELL?

08:28.933 --> 08:31.300
- OH, IT WAS GOING OKAY,

08:31.300 --> 08:33.133
AND THEN AGENT GARFIELD
READ ME A LETTER

08:33.133 --> 08:37.567
ABOUT CRAZY ROBERT
AND HIS LUCKY SUIT.

08:37.567 --> 08:38.667
- WHAT?

08:38.667 --> 08:41.700
- I NEVER SAID "CRAZY."

08:41.700 --> 08:42.900
- MA, WHAT DID YOU DO?

08:42.900 --> 08:44.400
- SHE FAXED THE FBI A LETTER

08:44.400 --> 08:46.400
ABOUT HOW SHE RUINED
MY LUCKY SUIT.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.867
- I WASN'T SURE
IT WENT THROUGH.

08:47.867 --> 08:50.467
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME
I EVER USED A FAX MACHINE.

08:51.900 --> 08:54.233
- MARIE, WHY DON'T YOU
GO INTO THE KITCHEN?

08:54.233 --> 08:56.633
ROBERT, HOW ABOUT
YOU JUST STAY HERE AND...

08:56.633 --> 08:58.167
MAYBE BLINK A FEW TIMES.

09:03.767 --> 09:05.000
- WHY WOULD YOU DO IT?

09:05.000 --> 09:06.167
WHY WOULD YOU SEND A LETTER?

09:06.167 --> 09:07.633
THE GUY LOOKED AT ME

09:07.633 --> 09:10.400
LIKE I WAS A PATHETIC,
CANDY-ASS MAMA'S BOY.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.700
- WELL, THEN HE SEEMS
AWFULLY CRITICAL.

09:12.700 --> 09:13.900
- HE'S THE FBI, MA!

09:13.900 --> 09:17.133
I WASN'T APPLYING
FOR A JOB AT THE GAP!

09:25.933 --> 09:29.000
[TV clicks on]

09:31.133 --> 09:33.733
- FRANK, TURN
THE TELEVISION OFF.

09:33.733 --> 09:34.767
- WHY?

09:34.767 --> 09:35.867
- BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING.

09:35.867 --> 09:38.900
- SO I'LL TURN IT UP LOUDER.

09:38.900 --> 09:41.033
HEY!

09:41.033 --> 09:44.767
- FRANK, ROBERT'S MEETING
DIDN'T GO VERY WELL.

09:44.767 --> 09:46.100
- WHAT MEETING?

09:46.100 --> 09:48.267
- WITH THE FBI, DAD.
PAY ATTENTION.

09:48.267 --> 09:49.800
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'LL TAKE HIS CLUELESSNESS

09:49.800 --> 09:53.433
OVER HER SABOTAGE
ANY DAY OF THE WEEK.

09:53.433 --> 09:54.333
- MY WHAT?

09:54.333 --> 09:55.867
- YOU HEARD ME!
YOUR SABOTAGE!

09:55.867 --> 09:57.433
YOU'RE A SABOTEUR.

09:57.433 --> 09:59.467
SABOTEUR!

09:59.467 --> 10:02.900
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I'M JUST TRYIN' TO HELP YOU!

10:02.900 --> 10:04.233
- OH, HELP.
HELP.

10:04.233 --> 10:05.533
YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP ME?

10:05.533 --> 10:07.067
LIKE THE GUY
WHO SHAVES YOUR ANKLES

10:07.067 --> 10:08.100
BEFORE THE ELECTRIC CHAIR?

10:08.100 --> 10:09.600
IS THAT THE KIND OF HELP?

10:09.600 --> 10:10.600
THANKS FOR THE HELP.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.033
WHAT DO I OWE YOU?

10:12.033 --> 10:14.033
- ALL RIGHT.

10:14.033 --> 10:15.433
YOU'RE UPSET
BECAUSE YOU FEEL

10:15.433 --> 10:17.133
YOUR INTERVIEW DIDN'T GO
AS WELL AS IT COULD,

10:17.133 --> 10:18.767
AND I'M SORRY TOO.

10:18.767 --> 10:21.100
BUT THAT DOESN'T GIVE YOU
THE RIGHT TO LASH OUT AT ME.

10:21.100 --> 10:23.767
- LISTEN TO ME, WOMAN!

10:29.367 --> 10:31.833
NOW, IF THIS WAS THE ONLY TIME
THAT YOU EVER SCREWED ME UP,

10:31.833 --> 10:35.100
I JUST WOULDA GONE HOME
AND SAID, "OH, THAT MOM."

10:41.933 --> 10:43.333
BUT THIS IS
JUST THE LATEST

10:43.333 --> 10:46.500
IN YOUR PSYCHOTIC
SERIES OF ATTEMPTS

10:46.500 --> 10:47.800
TO KEEP ME DOWN!

10:47.800 --> 10:49.933
- ROBERT, I THINK
YOU'RE GETTING CARRIED AWAY.

10:49.933 --> 10:52.300
- DEBRA, PLEASE.
WE'RE TALKING.

10:58.433 --> 11:01.900
- OH, COME ON, DEB, COME ON!
YOU KNOW HOW SHE IS!

11:01.900 --> 11:03.100
NOW'S YOUR CHANCE.

11:03.100 --> 11:04.567
TELL HER HOW YOU FEEL!
TELL HER!

11:04.567 --> 11:09.833
IT'S TIME TO RISE UP,
CAST OFF THE SHACKLES!

11:09.833 --> 11:12.767
- EASY THERE, SPARTACUS.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.800
- YEAH, ROBERT,
IN HINDSIGHT,

11:16.800 --> 11:19.467
MAYBE FAXING THAT LETTER
WASN'T THE BEST IDEA,

11:19.467 --> 11:22.000
BUT I THINK MARIE
WAS ONLY TRYING TO HELP.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.800
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.933
YOU'RE GONNA STAND THERE

11:25.933 --> 11:27.367
AND TELL ME
THAT SHE DOESN'T

11:27.367 --> 11:30.233
WRAP HER TENTACLES AROUND
EVERY PART OF YOUR LIFE

11:30.233 --> 11:33.467
AND SQUEEZE AND SQUEEZE
AND SQUEEZE AND SQUEEZE?

11:33.467 --> 11:35.467
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE GONNA
TELL ME RIGHT NOW?

11:42.533 --> 11:45.133
- OKAY, BUT SHE'S
NOT A SABOTEUR.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.300
- ROBBIE, PLEASE.

11:48.300 --> 11:49.800
WHY WOULD I WANT TO KEEP YOU
FROM GETTING THAT JOB?

11:49.800 --> 11:52.333
- SO YOU COULD KEEP YOUR FAMILY
THE WAY YOU LIKE IT:

11:52.333 --> 11:56.033
WITH YOU SITTIN' ON TOP,
QUEEN MARIE.

11:56.033 --> 11:57.933
- THIS IS CRAZY TALK!

11:57.933 --> 12:00.233
- OH, YEAH?
EVERYONE ELSE ISN'T BELOW YOU?

12:00.233 --> 12:02.833
LOOK, HERE'S
LITTLE PRINCE RAYMOND,

12:02.833 --> 12:03.933
HEIR TO THE THRONE.

12:03.933 --> 12:05.833
- WHAT THRONE?

12:05.833 --> 12:07.267
- SHUT UP!

12:09.167 --> 12:11.633
- YOU SAY "SHUT UP"
TO THE PRINCE?

12:14.267 --> 12:15.567
- AND THEN YOU HAVE
YOUR COURT JESTER,

12:15.567 --> 12:21.300
WITH HIS BALD HEAD
AND WEIGHTY BEHIND!

12:21.300 --> 12:24.400
- AND THEN THERE'S ME,
THE PEASANT, THE SERF.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.733
AND GOD FORBID I SHOULD
MOVE UP JUST A LITTLE,

12:26.733 --> 12:30.267
BECAUSE IT MIGHT UPSET
YOUR PERFECT ORDER!

12:30.267 --> 12:32.367
- YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY
BELIEVE THAT!

12:32.367 --> 12:33.967
- WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO BELIEVE?

12:33.967 --> 12:34.967
- I WOULD NEVER--

12:34.967 --> 12:36.433
- NO, LOOK, ENOUGH!

12:36.433 --> 12:38.133
JUST--

12:38.133 --> 12:40.267
JUST STAY OUT OF MY LIFE.

12:46.067 --> 12:48.800
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.867
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

12:50.867 --> 12:52.367
- THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

12:55.200 --> 13:00.233
- I REALLY THINK THE FBI
COULD USE MY SON.

13:04.567 --> 13:05.967
- MRS. BARONE--

13:05.967 --> 13:08.633
- NOW, I KNOW HE OVERREACTED
A LITTLE TO MY LETTER,

13:08.633 --> 13:11.567
BUT I THINK HE'D BE AN ASSET
TO YOUR ORGANIZATION...

13:11.567 --> 13:12.600
- MRS. BARONE.

13:12.600 --> 13:13.833
- SO COULD YOU
PICK UP THE PHONE--

13:13.833 --> 13:15.233
- MRS. BARONE.
- YES?

13:15.233 --> 13:17.567
- HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

13:20.133 --> 13:22.800
- I-I TALKED TO
THE MAN UP FRONT,

13:22.800 --> 13:24.167
AND I TOLD HIM

13:24.167 --> 13:25.733
I HAD TO SPEAK TO YOU
ABOUT MY SON ROBERT.

13:25.733 --> 13:29.733
AND THEY ASKED ME
IF I WAS THE LUCKY SUIT LADY,

13:29.733 --> 13:31.733
WHICH I GUESS I AM,

13:31.733 --> 13:33.333
SO I SAID YES,

13:33.333 --> 13:36.667
AND THEY SMILED,
AND THEY LET ME IN.

13:36.667 --> 13:38.500
- BASTARDS.

13:40.200 --> 13:43.333
- I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
FACE TO FACE.

13:43.333 --> 13:46.133
THAT LETTER,
I JUST SCRIBBLED THAT OUT

13:46.133 --> 13:47.900
TO GET TO YOU
AS FAST AS I COULD.

13:47.900 --> 13:49.400
- MRS. BARONE,

13:49.400 --> 13:52.033
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE REALLY HERE.

13:52.033 --> 13:56.800
- I'M A MOTHER.

13:56.800 --> 13:59.833
YOU HAVE A PICTURE
OF YOUR DEAR MOTHER

13:59.833 --> 14:02.533
LOOKING AT YOU EVERY DAY.

14:03.767 --> 14:05.400
- THAT'S MY WIFE.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.200
- A HANDSOME WOMAN.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.033
- MRS. BARONE,
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK

14:17.033 --> 14:19.533
YOU REALLY DON'T WANT
YOUR SON TO HAVE THIS JOB.

14:19.533 --> 14:22.367
- DID ROBBIE TELL YOU
TO SAY THAT TO ME?

14:22.367 --> 14:24.433
OR FRANK?
DID MY HUSBAND CALL YOU?

14:24.433 --> 14:25.900
- NO, I'M JUST LOOKING
AT THE EVIDENCE.

14:25.900 --> 14:27.267
- EVIDENCE.
WHAT EVIDENCE?

14:27.267 --> 14:29.067
WELL, YOU DID RUIN
HIS LUCKY SUIT.

14:29.067 --> 14:30.300
- THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.833
- OR PART OF
A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR.

14:32.833 --> 14:35.233
- YES.
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.

14:37.633 --> 14:39.833
- THEN YOU WROTE
THIS LETTER WHICH YOU SAID

14:39.833 --> 14:40.833
YOU SCRIBBLED OUT IN A HURRY.

14:40.833 --> 14:42.433
- THAT'S RIGHT.

14:42.433 --> 14:44.233
- MRS. BARONE,
I SPENT A YEAR

14:44.233 --> 14:46.967
TEACHING HANDWRITING ANALYSIS
AT THE ACADEMY.

14:46.967 --> 14:48.900
- I ALWAYS GOT "A"s
IN PENMANSHIP,

14:48.900 --> 14:51.133
SO I DON'T KNOW WHERE
YOU'RE GOIN' WITH THIS.

14:57.033 --> 15:01.200
- THIS LETTER WAS WRITTEN
WITH A COOL AND PURPOSEFUL HAND.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.067
- NO, I WAS IN A RUSH.

15:03.067 --> 15:04.967
- AND THEN, EVEN THOUGH ROBERT
TOLD YOU

15:04.967 --> 15:06.033
THE LETTER EMBARRASSED HIM,

15:06.033 --> 15:07.933
NOW YOU ARRIVE
IN PERSON.

15:07.933 --> 15:10.900
- I WANTED TO FIX
WHAT I DID.

15:10.900 --> 15:14.133
I MADE COOKIES!

15:14.133 --> 15:16.833
DOUBLE CHOCOLATE CHIP.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.900
- MRS. BARONE, YOU SEEM LIKE
AN INTELLIGENT WOMAN.

15:19.900 --> 15:22.400
- THANK YOU.
HAVE A COOKIE.

15:22.400 --> 15:23.967
- DO YOU REALLY THINK

15:23.967 --> 15:25.800
THAT A MOTHER INTERFERING
TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE

15:25.800 --> 15:30.300
COULD POSSIBLY HELP A MAN
GET A JOB WITH THE FBI?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.267
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
GOING ON.

15:38.967 --> 15:41.400
- HE WAS SUPPOSED TO RETIRE.

15:48.067 --> 15:52.333
HE'S A YEAR AWAY FROM
NOT BEING A POLICE OFFICER,

15:52.333 --> 15:54.867
WHICH MEANS I COULD STOP
WORRYING ABOUT HIM

15:54.867 --> 15:56.833
EVERY SECOND OF THE DAY.

15:56.833 --> 15:59.333
I WANT HIM TO BE SAFE.

15:59.333 --> 16:02.967
NOW HE WANTS TO GO FROM
ONE DANGEROUS JOB TO ANOTHER?

16:02.967 --> 16:04.833
HOW LONG DO I HAVE
TO WALK AROUND

16:04.833 --> 16:06.867
WITH A KNOT IN MY STOMACH?

16:06.867 --> 16:08.667
FOREVER?

16:11.900 --> 16:14.833
I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE.

16:14.833 --> 16:17.067
IT'S TOO MUCH.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.167
BUT HE WANTS THIS JOB.

16:28.133 --> 16:30.700
IT'LL MAKE HIM HAPPY.

16:30.700 --> 16:33.700
AND HE SHOULD BE HAPPY.

16:33.700 --> 16:36.767
SO, YES, HE SHOULD
HAVE THIS JOB.

16:36.767 --> 16:38.767
PLEASE, GIVE HIM THIS JOB.

16:41.800 --> 16:42.967
- I CAN'T DO THAT.

16:42.967 --> 16:45.000
- NO, NO--
DON'T BLAME HIM,

16:45.000 --> 16:46.533
YOU CAN PUNISH ME!

16:46.533 --> 16:50.567
PUT ONE OF THOSE
TRACKING THINGS ON MY LEGS

16:50.567 --> 16:53.200
SO I CAN'T
GET OUT OF THE HOUSE.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.600
AND IF YOU MET MY HUSBAND,

16:54.600 --> 16:57.000
YOU'D KNOW THAT'S
PUNISHMENT ENOUGH.

17:01.133 --> 17:03.900
- MRS. BARONE, THE REASON
YOUR SON ISN'T GETTING THIS JOB

17:03.900 --> 17:05.967
HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

17:05.967 --> 17:07.667
HE'S A FINE OFFICER;

17:07.667 --> 17:10.033
IT'S JUST THAT THERE ARE
BETTER QUALIFIED CANDIDATES

17:10.033 --> 17:11.267
FOR THE POSITION.

17:11.267 --> 17:14.800
- BETTER QUALIFIED
THAN MY ROBBIE?

17:14.800 --> 17:16.233
- YES.

17:21.333 --> 17:23.467
- ALL RIGHT,
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

17:28.933 --> 17:31.233
MY ROBBIE'S TOO GOOD FOR YOU.

17:31.933 --> 17:33.033
THAT'S RIGHT.

17:33.033 --> 17:34.300
HE'S TOO GOOD FOR THIS PLACE.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.067
AND MAYBE YOU COULD USE
A LUCKY SUIT,

17:36.067 --> 17:38.800
BECAUSE THAT'S A HORRIBLE COLOR
ON YOU.

17:38.800 --> 17:41.267
AND YOUR WIFE
DOES LOOK LIKE YOUR MOTHER.

17:46.767 --> 17:48.233
DO YOU VALIDATE PARKING?

17:54.700 --> 17:56.633
[knock at door]

18:00.200 --> 18:02.233
- HELLO, ROBBIE.

18:04.433 --> 18:06.533
- HEY.

18:06.533 --> 18:08.300
- MAY I COME IN?

18:11.667 --> 18:15.567
- I MADE YOU COOKIES.
DOUBLE CHOCOLATE CHIP.

18:18.600 --> 18:19.567
- THANK YOU.

18:22.467 --> 18:25.467
- YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID.

18:25.467 --> 18:26.833
- UH-HUH.

18:26.833 --> 18:29.667
- ABOUT ME SABOTAGING YOU.

18:29.667 --> 18:33.200
AND ALTHOUGH I'M NOT
CRAZY ABOUT THE WORD "SABOTAGE,"

18:33.200 --> 18:36.967
UM, MAYBE I UNDERSTAND NOW
WHAT YOU MEANT.

18:36.967 --> 18:38.533
- OH, YEAH?

18:38.533 --> 18:39.733
- YES.

18:39.733 --> 18:40.867
AFTER YOU SAID IT,

18:40.867 --> 18:43.400
I WENT FOR A DRIVE.

18:43.400 --> 18:46.433
AND I STOPPED AT THAT
DINER ON ROOSEVELT BOULEVARD

18:46.433 --> 18:50.667
FOR A CUP OF COFFEE
AND SOME BANANA CREAM PIE.

18:50.667 --> 18:54.667
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I THOUGHT, "MY GOSH,

18:54.667 --> 18:56.933
MAYBE ROBBIE IS RIGHT."

18:56.933 --> 18:58.067
- REALLY?

18:58.067 --> 19:02.033
- IT JUST HIT ME
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

19:02.033 --> 19:04.833
- REALLY?
AT A DINER?

19:04.833 --> 19:06.767
OVER BANANA CREAM PIE?

19:06.767 --> 19:09.433
- IT'S FUNNY
HOW THE MIND WORKS.

19:09.433 --> 19:12.200
- IT DIDN'T HAPPEN
AT THE FBI OFFICE

19:12.200 --> 19:16.267
OF AGENT TOM GARFIELD
ABOUT 35 MINUTES AGO?

19:19.033 --> 19:23.933
- NO, I THINK IT WAS THE DINER.

19:23.933 --> 19:25.333
- MA.

19:25.333 --> 19:27.233
- ALL RIGHT,
SO I WENT TO VISIT HIM.

19:27.233 --> 19:29.967
LOVE MAKES YOU DO
CRAZY THINGS SOMETIMES.

19:29.967 --> 19:32.000
- BANANA CREAM PIE.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.833
- HOW DID YOU
FIND OUT?

19:33.833 --> 19:35.233
- HE CALLED ME.
- WHAT?

19:35.233 --> 19:38.200
HOW DARE HE STICK HIS NOSE
INTO MY BUSINESS.

19:40.633 --> 19:44.233
- LOOK, MA,
HE TOLD ME WHAT YOU SAID.

19:44.233 --> 19:45.733
- WELL, HE'S A LIAR.

19:45.733 --> 19:48.700
- LOOK, MA.

19:48.700 --> 19:51.167
HE TOLD ME HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT MY JOB.

19:51.167 --> 19:53.900
- WELL, I'M SORRY.

19:53.900 --> 19:56.167
I CAN'T HELP IT.

19:57.533 --> 19:58.767
- I KNOW.

20:01.433 --> 20:03.000
THANKS.

20:09.733 --> 20:12.700
- SO, YOU GOIN' TO WORK NOW?
- YEP.

20:12.700 --> 20:13.700
- WELL, THEN, YOU--

20:13.700 --> 20:17.767
- I'LL BE CAREFUL.

20:17.767 --> 20:20.900
COME ON, I'LL WALK YOU
TO YOUR CAR.

20:20.900 --> 20:22.833
- LISTEN, JUST SO YOU KNOW,

20:22.833 --> 20:24.100
I DIDN'T MAKE EVERYTHING UP.

20:24.100 --> 20:25.900
I REALLY DID STOP FOR PIE.

20:25.900 --> 20:27.700
- THAT'S OKAY.

20:27.700 --> 20:28.733
- BUT IT WAS COCONUT.

20:28.733 --> 20:31.133
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I CHANGED IT.

20:36.833 --> 20:38.500
- OH, BOY.

20:38.500 --> 20:43.700
- HOW MUCH LONGER UNTIL THE
PRINCE RAYMOND SHOW COMES ON?

20:43.700 --> 20:45.000
- GOT ABOUT A MINUTE.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.433
- I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T GONNA
WATCH IT, MA.

20:49.433 --> 20:50.433
- QUIET.

20:53.900 --> 20:55.800
- HERE, UNCLE ROBERT.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.133
- HEY, WHAT'S THIS?

20:57.133 --> 20:58.900
- I HEARD ABOUT
YOUR LUCKY SUIT,

20:58.900 --> 21:00.900
SO I MADE YOU
THIS LUCKY HAT.

21:00.900 --> 21:02.233
all: AW...

21:02.233 --> 21:04.867
- WELL, THANKS, GEOFFREY.

21:04.867 --> 21:05.900
THAT IS SO SWEET OF HIM.

21:05.900 --> 21:07.233
THAT MEANS SO MUCH TO--

21:07.233 --> 21:09.100
- ALL RIGHT, QUIET.
HERE COMES RAYMOND.

21:17.967 --> 21:19.833
- "GAME CHAT"
WILL NOT BE SEEN TONIGHT

21:19.833 --> 21:21.000
SO THAT WE CAN BRING YOU

21:21.000 --> 21:23.800
CONTINUING LOCAL
ELECTION COVERAGE.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.700
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

21:25.700 --> 21:28.633
[all speaking at once]

21:33.267 --> 21:35.033
- YOU THINK THAT THEY WOULD
SHOW IT ANOTHER NIGHT?

21:35.033 --> 21:37.867
- THEY NEVER REPEAT IT AGAIN;
IT'S A DIFFERENT TOPIC.

21:37.867 --> 21:41.200
IT'S A DIFFERENT TOPIC.
THEY DON'T REPEAT IT.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.400
- I WAS FUNNY, TOO.
I WAS GOOD ON IT.
