[Meredith] <i>Previously on </i>Grey's Anatomy...

00:02.834 --> 00:04.166
OK, Cindy Wright.

00:04.250 --> 00:05.166

00:05.250 --> 00:06.667
Arrest this woman for child trafficking!

00:06.750 --> 00:08.583
[Bailey] Please escort
Dr. DeLuca to my office.

00:08.667 --> 00:10.250
What? Me?!
What, you're just gonna let her go?

00:10.542 --> 00:12.000
I did the job that needed to be done!

00:12.083 --> 00:13.041
Andrew, you sound like your father.

00:13.125 --> 00:14.166
This is Gemma.

00:14.250 --> 00:15.917
-Uh, she's a friend.
-I can see that.

00:16.208 --> 00:17.917
Something's wrong with me.
What's happening?

00:18.208 --> 00:20.291
[DeLuca] <i>Cobalt poisoning would explain</i>
<i>the dementia, the depression,</i>

00:20.375 --> 00:22.291
hallucinations, tremors-- everything.

00:22.375 --> 00:23.959
Is your mind playing tricks on you again?

00:24.041 --> 00:26.041
[Richard] <i>Did you stand by me</i>
<i>while I was being fired?</i>

00:26.125 --> 00:27.667
I'm tired of telling you that I want more.

00:27.750 --> 00:29.041
I hope you find someone
who will give that to you.

00:29.291 --> 00:30.250
Dr. Winston Ndugu.

00:30.333 --> 00:32.792
I have had a crush on you
since my first day of residency.

00:32.875 --> 00:34.375
[Link]
<i>What do you think of the name Scout?</i>

00:34.583 --> 00:35.500
So cute. [chuckles]

00:35.583 --> 00:37.000
-We're getting married.
-I want a life with you.

00:37.083 --> 00:38.834
[Koracick] <i>Are you really sure</i>
<i>you want to close this door?</i>

00:38.917 --> 00:39.875
A voicemail from Dr. Altman.

00:39.959 --> 00:42.125
[Teddy groaning] <i>I can't leave with you.</i>

00:42.208 --> 00:43.166
<i>I am marrying Owen.</i>

00:43.250 --> 00:45.417
I'm so sorry, honey. We'll reschedule.

00:45.542 --> 00:46.917
Why are we rescheduling?

00:51.417 --> 00:53.625
[Meredith] <i>I've heard</i>
<i>that when tidal waves hit,</i>

00:53.709 --> 00:55.875
<i>there are often people watching on shore.</i>

01:00.333 --> 01:04.166
<i>They see the disaster coming,</i>
<i>see the horizon disappearing.</i>

01:04.250 --> 01:07.291
<i>They don't really see until it's too late.</i>

01:09.667 --> 01:11.250
<i>There's a lecture we take in residency</i>

01:11.333 --> 01:14.041
<i>that's meant to prepare us</i>
<i>for such surprises.</i>

01:14.125 --> 01:16.333
<i>It's called Disaster Ethics--</i>

01:16.417 --> 01:19.166
<i>where future surgeons imagine</i>
<i>what they would do</i>

01:19.250 --> 01:21.125
<i>when the unimaginable happens.</i>

01:24.875 --> 01:28.041
[gasps]

01:28.125 --> 01:29.625
<i>But it's imperfect.</i>

01:30.875 --> 01:34.125
<i>Because while it's good</i>
<i>to plan for the worst,</i>

01:34.208 --> 01:36.834
<i>you can't really know how you'll handle it</i>

01:36.917 --> 01:39.500
<i>until you're smack dab</i>
<i>in the middle of it,</i>

01:39.583 --> 01:42.625
<i>under the wave, trying not to drown.</i>

01:48.709 --> 01:51.583
-[cheers and applause]
-[Ben] Thank you!

01:51.667 --> 01:54.375
Yes! Thank you, all!

01:55.000 --> 01:55.875
OK.

02:11.625 --> 02:13.583
I'll see you after the shift change.

02:13.959 --> 02:14.917
You be careful out there.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.667
You be careful <i>in </i>there.

02:17.458 --> 02:19.542
We are doing everything right.

02:19.625 --> 02:22.458
We are wearing masks.
We are wearing gloves.

02:22.542 --> 02:23.959
We are slowing the spread.

02:24.041 --> 02:27.000
I am good and my family is g--

02:28.125 --> 02:31.417
Oh, please don't tell me
you're experiencing symptoms.

02:31.500 --> 02:34.875
I am absolutely not
experiencing any symptoms.

02:34.959 --> 02:36.500
I'm here to work.

02:37.625 --> 02:38.834
I'm cobalt free, Miranda.

02:38.917 --> 02:41.083
I've done my hip rehab.
I'm better than ever.

02:41.166 --> 02:43.458
Just tell me where you want me,
but don't say back home.

02:43.542 --> 02:44.792
Well, everything's changed.

02:44.875 --> 02:47.542
I mean, specialties no longer matter.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.542
Surgeons check temperatures.

02:49.667 --> 02:52.208
Attendings do scut. It's a madhouse.

02:52.291 --> 02:53.166
On fire.

02:53.250 --> 02:54.583
Well, you better show me around.

02:54.667 --> 02:55.542
Unless you're too busy.

02:55.625 --> 02:57.625
You can send me off with a resident.

02:57.709 --> 02:59.542
You know, I'd love to say hello to DeLuca.

03:00.709 --> 03:03.500
[tape rewinds]

03:03.583 --> 03:05.834
DeLuca is no longer a resident.

03:05.917 --> 03:07.750
So, Andrew's in the on-call room on 3.

03:07.834 --> 03:08.959
He didn't even want to come in today,

03:09.041 --> 03:11.166
but I didn't think
he should be alone, so...

03:11.250 --> 03:14.792
Right. Because you're so concerned
about his well-being.

03:14.875 --> 03:16.166
This is unbelievable.

03:16.250 --> 03:17.458
What happened with DeLuca now?

03:17.542 --> 03:19.667
He could barely get up
after Richard's surgery.

03:19.750 --> 03:22.166
It's the depression that
always comes after the mania.

03:22.250 --> 03:24.542
You knew this happens,
b-but you pushed him anyways.

03:24.625 --> 03:25.500
And you let her.

03:29.250 --> 03:32.583
First stop for every employee.
A few questions.

03:32.709 --> 03:36.125
And if your temperature's
even a hair over 100 degrees,

03:36.208 --> 03:38.125
you go back home. No exceptions.

03:38.208 --> 03:41.000
And once you're cleared--
here, get in here--

03:41.083 --> 03:42.291
you will change

03:42.375 --> 03:44.375
and be fitted with a new N95.

03:45.375 --> 03:47.417
All right, let's move it.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.500

[Winston, over FaceTime]
<i>How was the picnic?</i>

03:51.083 --> 03:52.834
[Maggie]
It turned into a sleepover, actually.

03:52.917 --> 03:55.333
[<i>chuckles</i>] <i>On the laundry-room floor?</i>

03:55.375 --> 03:56.667
Yeah, Zola didn't want me to leave,

03:56.750 --> 03:59.125
and I-I was too tired
to go back to the hotel room.

03:59.208 --> 04:01.542
So she had a picnic on the kitchen floor,

04:01.625 --> 04:03.542
<i>and I got takeout.</i>

04:03.625 --> 04:06.500
<i>And we talked to each other</i>
<i>through the closed door,</i>

04:06.583 --> 04:08.709
and then I made a bed

04:08.792 --> 04:10.375
out of some baby blankets
I found in the dryer.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.500
-You are such a good aunt.
-[chuckles]

04:12.583 --> 04:14.583
Yeah, my back is killing me,

04:14.709 --> 04:17.333
<i>but it sure beats lying</i>
<i>in my hotel-room bed</i>

04:17.417 --> 04:19.917
and watching terrifying
statistics on the news

04:20.000 --> 04:21.625
and knowing that's not even
half the story.

04:21.709 --> 04:23.709
Yeah. I tried explaining to my grandma

04:23.792 --> 04:25.750
how this is impacting
Black folks more severely.

04:25.834 --> 04:28.041
<i>But all she wants to talk</i>
<i>about is how sacrilegious it is</i>

04:28.125 --> 04:29.583
<i>to attend church </i><i>on a computer.</i>

[Kingsley]
Dr. Ndugu, we have a dissection.

04:33.208 --> 04:34.583
Uh, I gotta go, babe. Love you.

04:34.667 --> 04:37.458
[cellphone beeps]

04:37.542 --> 04:38.583
-Love you?
-Hm?

04:40.166 --> 04:41.500
Were you eavesdropping on my call?

04:41.583 --> 04:43.000
Not on purpose.

04:44.333 --> 04:45.917
Sounds like things
are going pretty well, though,

04:46.000 --> 04:47.583
if you're at "love you" already.

04:47.667 --> 04:48.917
Well, we're not. I'm not-- We're--

04:49.000 --> 04:52.250
That's just-- That's just,
like, a-a thing people say.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.250
By rote. Is it?

04:54.375 --> 04:56.041
How's Vic?

04:56.166 --> 04:58.750
It's really nice of them
to clap us in and out every day.

04:58.834 --> 05:01.125
I-- [sighs] I really appreciate that.

05:01.208 --> 05:03.625
-Yeah.
-Yeah. It really is.

[Vic] Hey, hey, hey, I'm--

-Oh, hey!
-Oh!

05:20.750 --> 05:22.500
-Uh, what is--
-Oh! No.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.166
What is going on? Hi.

05:24.250 --> 05:25.458
No, no. Um...

05:26.208 --> 05:27.208
I thought--

05:27.291 --> 05:29.959
We were texting and you said
to come over with nothing on.

05:30.041 --> 05:31.959
-I didn't mean right now.
-So you-- OK.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.750
-OK. Um, sorry. I'm sorry. Hello?
-Hi.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.375
-Come on--
-No, no, you know what? Actually. No.

05:37.458 --> 05:39.166
It's fine. It's OK. It's good.

05:39.250 --> 05:40.959
It's not that... cold out, actually,

05:41.041 --> 05:42.959
-so I'm just-- I'm gonna go.
-Hey. No, you don't need to leave.

05:43.041 --> 05:44.500
No, I do. I have to, OK?

05:44.583 --> 05:45.917
This is...

05:47.083 --> 05:48.125
This was good.

05:48.208 --> 05:51.291
<i>This </i>was a mistake. But this whole thing.

05:51.375 --> 05:52.667
I'm not a...

05:54.000 --> 05:55.834
I'm not a stepmom.

05:57.041 --> 05:58.834
You're not a stepmom.

05:58.917 --> 06:02.750
I'm just-- I'm a person
who shows up at penthouses

06:02.834 --> 06:05.208
wearing puffy coats
and nothing else, so...

06:05.291 --> 06:06.250
Yeah.

06:07.458 --> 06:08.792
Wow. OK.

06:08.875 --> 06:12.083
Um, this was too much too soon.

06:12.166 --> 06:13.291
Thank you.

06:14.083 --> 06:16.333
Hi, Harriett, it was really nice--

06:16.417 --> 06:18.959
really nice to meet you
after all this time.

06:19.041 --> 06:21.542
Um, OK, bye.

06:21.625 --> 06:23.208
Godspeed.

-[Perez] Next.
-[man] This happens when I eat nuts,

06:25.125 --> 06:26.500
but I didn't eat any nuts.

06:26.583 --> 06:29.250
-Uh, I don't think.
-Those food labels are small.

06:29.333 --> 06:30.417
-Here.
-[thermometer beeps]

06:30.500 --> 06:31.917
OK, 98.6.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.500
So you are going to want to follow

06:33.583 --> 06:34.834
the purple line to the ER.

06:34.917 --> 06:36.583
I don't want a Chinese doctor.

06:37.834 --> 06:39.458
Oh, OK.

06:39.542 --> 06:40.500
Then you're going to want to follow

06:40.583 --> 06:42.041
this green line to the parking lot,

06:42.125 --> 06:43.667
put your rude self back in your car

06:43.750 --> 06:46.291
and hope you don't go into
anaphylactic shock.

06:47.917 --> 06:49.709
I'll follow the purple line to the ER.

06:49.792 --> 06:51.250
Perfect.

06:52.458 --> 06:54.500
OMG. Dr. Webber.

06:54.583 --> 06:56.250
You look great. Hearts.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.333
Perez.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.625
Next.

06:58.750 --> 07:01.000
[indistinct conversations]

07:01.125 --> 07:02.375
Hey.

07:02.458 --> 07:04.792
Can you please make sure
this gets up to the Covid floor

07:04.875 --> 07:07.041
-with Enna Ravera?
-Just leave it.

07:07.125 --> 07:09.166
Uh, hey, Karen, uh, could I get an update

07:09.542 --> 07:11.166
for Ike Donerson?
He's a friend of a friend.

07:11.250 --> 07:13.083
Happy to check on him for you, Dr. Hunt.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.500
-Hope the kids are doing OK.
-Oh, thanks.

07:15.583 --> 07:18.542
Um, my mom's hands are full,
but she's managing.

07:19.959 --> 07:21.542
[Bailey] There's another tent for visitors

07:21.625 --> 07:23.375
'cause none are allowed in the hospital

07:23.458 --> 07:25.083
unless accompanying a young child.

07:25.166 --> 07:27.709
-[Owen] Dr. Webber?
-Ah, Hunt.

07:27.792 --> 07:30.583
Altman. I-I-Is it still Altman?

07:30.667 --> 07:33.792
-Yeah, still Altman.
-Ah.

07:33.875 --> 07:36.083
I hate to leave,
but I-I-I got to get back.

07:36.166 --> 07:37.959
Yeah, and I-I've got another--

07:38.041 --> 07:40.625
-Uh.
-All right, the less severe symptoms

07:40.709 --> 07:42.125
are sent home to self-quarantine.

07:42.208 --> 07:43.792
The more severe are admitted.

07:44.125 --> 07:46.875
The entire OR heard a recording

07:46.959 --> 07:50.375
of Altman and Koracick having sex...

07:50.458 --> 07:53.250
-[sighs]
-...or was that the cobalt talking?

07:54.500 --> 07:56.959
-That was not the cobalt.
-Ooh!

07:57.041 --> 07:58.583
[chuckling] Stop it. Stop it.

07:58.667 --> 07:59.709
-You're bad. Stop it.
-Stop?

07:59.792 --> 08:01.792
I came back just so
I could ask the question.

08:01.875 --> 08:03.083
[both laugh]

08:03.166 --> 08:04.250
-[Bailey] What is wrong--
-What?

08:07.208 --> 08:09.750
[Bailey] The entire east wing
is now a Covid ward.

08:09.834 --> 08:13.000
We've converted whole floors
into negative pressure rooms.

08:13.083 --> 08:16.333
Severe patients go to
this special Covid ICU.

08:16.417 --> 08:18.166
So far we have enough ventilators.

08:18.250 --> 08:20.709
Well, what about PPE for the staff?

08:20.792 --> 08:22.417
We are reusing what we have,

08:22.500 --> 08:23.709
-but we need more-- a lot--
-Wait.

08:23.792 --> 08:25.792
-No, no, no, no.
-Well, someone's coding here.

08:25.875 --> 08:29.000
Uh, and we have staff inside
to deal with it.

08:29.083 --> 08:31.166
Look, hospitals are losing
too many of their own.

08:31.250 --> 08:34.208
So no one goes through
those doors without full PPE,

08:34.291 --> 08:35.625
which is in short supply.

08:35.709 --> 08:37.750
Yes, it goes against everything we teach,

08:37.834 --> 08:40.125
but there are no emergencies
in a pandemic.

08:40.208 --> 08:42.125
Marvin Lindstrom. 83.

08:42.208 --> 08:46.166
He was fine yesterday,
became hypoxic an hour ago.

08:46.250 --> 08:48.834
It's the fourth patient I've lost today,

08:48.917 --> 08:50.458
and they're all dying alone.

08:50.542 --> 08:52.583
Welcome back, Richard.

09:03.083 --> 09:05.917
Hey, so, bed 4 needs
to go up for CT, OK?

09:06.000 --> 09:08.625
-[man] Still has pain in the chest?
-[woman] Yes.

09:08.709 --> 09:10.500
[siren wails]

09:12.125 --> 09:13.208
-Hughes, we're not taking--
-[Vic] No, I know.

09:13.291 --> 09:14.834
I know you're not taking
any non-Covid cases,

09:14.917 --> 09:17.166
but you are taking this teenager
with full thickness burns

09:17.250 --> 09:18.667
from head to toe from a car explosion.

09:18.750 --> 09:19.750
I intubated him on the scene.

09:19.834 --> 09:21.542
He's hypotensive and tachycardic
and you are the best

09:21.625 --> 09:23.625
so you are taking him because
if you send us away, he dies,

09:23.709 --> 09:25.250
and that makes you a murderer.

09:25.333 --> 09:26.417
-OK.
-OK.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.917
Trauma 1.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.834
You were right to bring him here.

09:32.208 --> 09:36.583
Emergent surgeries only,
so it's empty most of the time.

09:36.667 --> 09:39.125
-Oh, how the mighty have fallen.
-[cellphone dings, vibrates]

09:39.208 --> 09:41.834
I try not to look at it. Too sad.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.125
Bailey, what the hell is that?

09:46.250 --> 09:49.000
Oh, not that, <i>her.</i>

09:52.166 --> 09:54.083
[Bailey] She's my new best friend.

09:54.166 --> 09:55.917
She hates germs as much as I do.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.500
Uh, see that UV light?

09:57.583 --> 09:59.709
It can disinfect a room in minutes.

09:59.792 --> 10:01.125
Hands-free. [laughs]

10:01.208 --> 10:03.709
That's incredible.

10:03.792 --> 10:06.542
I used to go see babies
when I needed serotonin.

10:06.625 --> 10:09.208
But they don't let visitors
on the OB floor anymore.

10:09.291 --> 10:10.667
So now I come see her.

10:10.750 --> 10:13.917
She's sleek, beautiful, she hates germs.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.792
-I love her.
-[Koracick] Uh, do my eyes deceive me?

10:16.875 --> 10:19.125
Captain Cobalt, welcome back.

10:19.208 --> 10:20.792
-[Bailey] Ugh.
-What, too soon?

10:20.875 --> 10:22.667
No, in all seriousness,

10:22.750 --> 10:24.583
I'm so happy to see you
on your feet again.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.125
What's with the nine iron?

10:26.208 --> 10:28.291
Oh, well, this way
you won't get any closer

10:28.375 --> 10:29.417
than, uh, six feet from me.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.750
You don't need a golf club for that, Tom.

10:31.834 --> 10:32.959
Any word on the shipment?

10:33.041 --> 10:34.917
Uh, relax, Bailey.
I said it's coming, it's coming.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.333
What, you got N95s and face shields?

10:37.417 --> 10:40.458
Because there's pirates
out there and hucksters.

10:40.542 --> 10:42.083
[sighs]

10:42.166 --> 10:43.458
Has Catherine been coming in?

10:43.542 --> 10:44.959
-[cellphone dings, vibrates]
-Sometimes.

10:45.041 --> 10:47.583
-Uh, Richard, I've got a trauma.
-Oh, I'll come.

10:47.667 --> 10:50.583
No, you go read the safety manuals

10:50.667 --> 10:52.166
and memorize the new protocols.

10:52.250 --> 10:55.083
Can't let anything
fall through the cracks.

10:55.166 --> 10:56.250
Or anyone.

10:59.792 --> 11:01.000
Can I help you?

11:01.083 --> 11:04.041
A patient of your brother's
would like to see him.

11:04.125 --> 11:06.959
-No. Absolutely not.
-It's Cindy Wright.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.000
The girl he said was being trafficked.

11:09.083 --> 11:10.667
It appears he was right.

11:10.792 --> 11:13.625
S-She's here? Is she OK?

11:13.709 --> 11:17.000
She is here but I would not say
she is OK.

11:17.083 --> 11:19.417
No, Bailey, you need to stop doing this.

11:19.500 --> 11:21.291
I-I wouldn't be here
if it were anyone else.

11:21.375 --> 11:23.375
But I think he's
the only person in the world

11:23.458 --> 11:24.750
she trusts right now.

11:28.166 --> 11:30.834
-Oh, my--
-[sighs]

11:30.917 --> 11:32.458
[sighs]

11:37.083 --> 11:38.250
[sighs]

11:38.333 --> 11:39.333
You sure about this?

11:39.417 --> 11:40.792
No.

11:54.083 --> 11:55.458
-Hey.
-[Cindy] I'm so sorry.

11:56.542 --> 11:58.166
I'm sorry I didn't listen,
but I was scared.

11:58.250 --> 12:01.125
You do not need to apologize
for anything, OK?

12:02.041 --> 12:03.458
I'm just glad you came back.

12:06.041 --> 12:07.875
Walk me through what happened.
How did you get here?

12:09.583 --> 12:12.875
I got sicker, and Opal said I was useless.

12:14.041 --> 12:16.375
She dropped me off
on the side of the interstate.

12:17.458 --> 12:19.291
But I remembered the name of this place.

12:19.709 --> 12:20.583
And you.

12:21.917 --> 12:23.583
Chief, do you mind if I go in with her?

12:23.667 --> 12:25.750
-I'll throw on some lead.
-Of course.

12:35.625 --> 12:37.834
Isn't DeLuca...

12:37.917 --> 12:39.709
I mean, people have been saying he--

12:39.792 --> 12:41.083
Get the man a vest.

12:55.959 --> 12:57.000
[ringing]

12:57.083 --> 12:58.333
-[Levi] <i>Hi.</i>
-Schmitt.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.083
Marvin Lindstrom just died.

13:01.166 --> 13:04.333
[sighs] No. Please, no.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.959
I tried calling his wife.
It rolled to voicemail.

13:07.041 --> 13:09.000
<i>-Are you with her?</i>
-She's here.

13:09.375 --> 13:11.166
Her flip phone died,
and we didn't have a charger.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.375
She wanted to say goodbye to him.

13:13.458 --> 13:15.291
Well, I wanted that, too, Schmitt.

13:15.375 --> 13:17.417
There just wasn't time.
It happened so fast.

13:18.583 --> 13:21.041
They were married 62 years.

13:21.125 --> 13:22.875
<i>I held his hand </i><i>while he died.</i>

13:22.959 --> 13:25.000
So if you can't deliver the news to her,

13:25.083 --> 13:27.333
just find someone who can.

13:27.417 --> 13:30.250
-[cellphone beeps]
-[sighs]

13:31.125 --> 13:32.041
[Bailey] What do we have?

13:32.125 --> 13:33.709
[Owen] Engine blew when
he was trying to cool it down.

13:33.792 --> 13:34.875
It started a fire.

13:34.959 --> 13:36.917
He's got extensive full-thickness burns.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.041
-Let's hang some fluids.
-[woman] On it.

13:38.125 --> 13:41.000
Kids decided to break quarantine,
went out to a party.

13:41.083 --> 13:42.333
A party? Now?

13:42.417 --> 13:44.583
OK, I gotta call my kids
and threaten them.

13:44.667 --> 13:46.959
You want, uh, back up?
Want me to page Altman?

13:47.041 --> 13:47.959
No, no, no, we're good.

13:48.041 --> 13:49.500
He's hypotensive.

13:49.583 --> 13:51.417
Arms are all charred.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.291
This IV's blown. I need access.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.917
-[Owen] OK. IO kit.
-[woman] Right away, Doctor.

13:56.041 --> 13:57.458
[Owen] OK, here we go.

13:59.166 --> 14:00.834
Order a trauma panel.
Let's get x-ray in here.

14:00.917 --> 14:01.959
His sats are still dropping.

14:02.041 --> 14:03.375
He's getting harder to bag.

14:03.458 --> 14:05.458
These chest burns are preventing
his lungs from expanding.

14:05.542 --> 14:07.250
-[sighs] Escharotomy. Scalpel.
-Escharotomy. Scalpel.

14:15.917 --> 14:17.417
[Jackson] Alright, we need to get
this kid to an OR

14:17.500 --> 14:19.500
-and start debriding, ASAP.
-[Owen] Yeah, I already paged for help.

14:19.583 --> 14:20.500
I need to stay down here.

14:20.583 --> 14:21.917
There's other kids coming in
from this fire.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
-All right, copy that.
-[Jo] Hey, Hunt, I got your page.

14:24.083 --> 14:25.333
And here's your help.

14:26.417 --> 14:27.875
[tape rewinds]

14:32.792 --> 14:33.917
Everything OK?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Great.

14:38.542 --> 14:40.583
OK. Let's get ready to move.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
[man] Watch your back.

14:50.750 --> 14:51.667
[sighs]

14:54.709 --> 14:58.208
You hear this, uh, kid
was out partying with friends?

14:59.458 --> 15:01.458
I don't know what the hell
these kids are thinking.

15:02.583 --> 15:06.000
Yeah, well, people do stupid things.

15:10.834 --> 15:13.083
-[knock on door]
-Hey.

15:13.166 --> 15:14.500
Hey.

15:14.583 --> 15:17.709
I'm, uh, about to be done here
if you need the room.

15:17.792 --> 15:20.709
No, actually, I was looking for you.

15:20.792 --> 15:22.583
I need a favor.

15:22.667 --> 15:23.834
Cool. Consult?

15:23.917 --> 15:25.417
Yeah, kind of.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.208
Um... [chuckles]

15:27.291 --> 15:30.125
Actually, no, not-- not like a consult.

15:30.208 --> 15:31.291
Um...

15:31.375 --> 15:32.542
S--

15:32.625 --> 15:33.500
Sex.

15:33.583 --> 15:34.458
What's that?

15:34.542 --> 15:35.375
[Jo] Sex.

15:35.458 --> 15:37.083
I need sex.

15:37.166 --> 15:39.208
I need a sex favor.

15:39.291 --> 15:40.959
A sexual favor.

15:43.291 --> 15:45.333
[clears throat] I-- W-What?

15:45.417 --> 15:50.083
I need a bridge over the river
of the husband who abandoned me.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.083
A short bridge.

15:51.166 --> 15:55.709
No, like a-- like a one-night bridge.

15:57.667 --> 15:59.583
I-I can't tell if you're
being serious. Are you--

15:59.667 --> 16:02.667
Look, I don't know how to be
single or feel single again.

16:02.750 --> 16:05.917
I just-- I-I don't know how
to cross over the bridge

16:06.000 --> 16:09.875
over into the land of Not a Sad Sack.

16:09.959 --> 16:12.750
Of Not a-- The land of Not a Sad Sack?

16:12.834 --> 16:16.083
-OK.
-OK, I-I need to have sex, Jackson.

16:16.166 --> 16:17.792
With someone that I trust to be safe

16:17.875 --> 16:20.166
and-- and just not murder me in my sleep.

16:20.250 --> 16:22.417
And I need a bridge, so I'm asking.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.959
I am truly asking for a favor.

16:25.083 --> 16:26.834
A sexy favor.

16:26.917 --> 16:28.792
OK, and you-- and you can say no

16:28.875 --> 16:33.041
if you feel used
or objectified or whatever,

16:33.125 --> 16:35.083
but I hope that you just feel flattered

16:35.166 --> 16:39.333
because I'm mostly saying
that you're a human male

16:39.417 --> 16:42.000
that I kind of trust.

16:44.333 --> 16:45.166
OK.

16:45.291 --> 16:47.792
Like, <i>OK </i>OK?

16:47.875 --> 16:49.959
I mean, it's not exactly a hardship, Jo.

16:50.041 --> 16:52.834
Oh, my God. OK. Um... tonight?

16:52.917 --> 16:54.792
-Sure. Yeah.
-OK.

16:54.875 --> 16:56.750
-My-- My place?
-OK. Yes!

16:56.834 --> 16:59.208
Thank you. Thank you. You're the best.

16:59.291 --> 17:01.375
-Thanks.
-OK.

17:01.458 --> 17:02.917
Yo!

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
-OK.
-OK, Jo.

17:05.875 --> 17:09.583
Dora, hi, it's Dr. Grey calling.

17:09.667 --> 17:12.959
I-- I'm OK, thank you for asking.

17:13.041 --> 17:17.000
Dora, I-I'm so sorry
to tell you, but your father--

17:17.083 --> 17:19.583
his condition got much worse last night.

17:19.667 --> 17:22.667
So, um, I'm afraid if--

17:22.750 --> 17:25.125
if you do want to come
and say goodbye, then--

17:25.208 --> 17:27.583
then you should come soon.

17:28.417 --> 17:29.250
Now.

17:31.208 --> 17:32.542
OK.

17:32.625 --> 17:35.417
OK, uh, just call me when you're here,

17:35.500 --> 17:37.083
and I'll make the arrangements.

17:38.375 --> 17:40.875
OK. I'm-- I'm so-- I'm so sorry.

17:42.250 --> 17:43.125
OK.

17:46.458 --> 17:48.458
[sighs]

17:49.500 --> 17:52.291
[cellphone clicks, buttons clicking]

17:52.375 --> 17:54.291
[text chimes]

17:58.583 --> 18:00.291
[soft snore]

18:05.417 --> 18:06.917
[DeLuca] You're doing great, Cindy.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.458
Almost done, OK?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.250
I'm not Cindy.

18:17.417 --> 18:18.959
My name is Erin Banks.

18:19.875 --> 18:21.542
I'm from Scottsdale, Arizona.

18:25.083 --> 18:27.500
This photographer followed me on Snapchat.

18:28.959 --> 18:31.083
He said that he had a modeling agency

18:31.166 --> 18:32.625
and that I was beautiful.

18:33.375 --> 18:35.583
He wanted to meet, but my parents said no.

18:36.250 --> 18:37.875
<i>My sister said it was sketchy.</i>

18:40.834 --> 18:42.625
<i>But I snuck out to meet him.</i>

18:46.792 --> 18:48.000
<i>That was two years ago.</i>

18:48.083 --> 18:50.625
Two years? So she was fourteen.

18:50.709 --> 18:52.792
-Helm...
-[paper tears]

18:52.875 --> 18:56.000
Take this. Call the police immediately.

18:56.083 --> 18:57.750
Say to them what she just said.

18:57.834 --> 18:58.917
Her family needs to know

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
their little girl is still alive. Go, go.

19:01.083 --> 19:03.083
[sighs]

19:04.458 --> 19:06.166
Lord, help us.

19:06.250 --> 19:08.083
[Erin] <i>My parents tried to warn me,</i>

19:08.166 --> 19:10.083
but I'm so dumb.

19:10.166 --> 19:11.333
I'm so stupid.

19:11.417 --> 19:13.375
Hey, hey, stop that. OK, listen to me.

19:13.458 --> 19:15.125
None of this is your fault, OK?

19:15.208 --> 19:16.083
None of it.

19:17.041 --> 19:19.834
It's Opal, and people like her.

19:19.917 --> 19:21.083
It's their fault.

19:22.166 --> 19:23.917
And we got you.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.583
And they're never going to
hurt you ever again, OK?

19:28.083 --> 19:30.750
Opal said that if I ran, she'd kill me,

19:30.834 --> 19:34.542
and if I told anyone, she'd find
my sister and take her, too.

19:43.542 --> 19:46.208
-[siren wails]
-[Koracick] Soak it in, kids.

19:46.291 --> 19:48.834
Bask in the glory of the PPE mother lode.

19:48.917 --> 19:50.583
It's beautiful.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.792
It came? It actually came!

19:52.875 --> 19:55.750
-[both laugh]
-I forgot what good news feels like.

19:55.834 --> 19:58.458
-Altman, can I help you?
-Uh, yeah.

19:58.542 --> 20:00.709
I mean, our nurses are using rubber bands

20:00.792 --> 20:01.667
to hold on their masks.

20:01.750 --> 20:02.834
Can't we help you open these?

of safety precautions?

You committed all
of those protocols to memory?

Look, this is no longer
the hospital that you left.

on being here,

then you are going to need
to know how we operate now.

to read the safety protocol,

40:18.625 --> 40:20.667
And I-I-- You were trying
to do me a favor

40:20.750 --> 40:23.667
-and I just-- I--
-It was a favor you weren't ready for.

40:24.625 --> 40:27.166
-I really wasn't.
-It's fine. You--

40:27.250 --> 40:28.959
Look, you've been through hell, OK?

40:29.041 --> 40:30.125
You were doing your best.

40:30.208 --> 40:31.417
You're still doing your best.

40:31.500 --> 40:34.709
And we are, um, friends.

40:35.750 --> 40:39.667
So if you can get over the mortification

40:39.750 --> 40:42.625
and stop treating me like crap,
I figure we're all good.

40:42.709 --> 40:44.667
Can we just pretend it never happened?

40:45.625 --> 40:46.458
Done.

40:46.542 --> 40:49.000
OK. Alright.

40:54.917 --> 40:56.250
[Deborah] I saw Kayden.

40:56.333 --> 40:57.792
It's bad.

40:58.917 --> 41:01.041
[voice breaking] He was so bandaged

41:01.125 --> 41:03.125
that I couldn't see his face.

41:03.250 --> 41:06.291
-One second, OK. Hi, um, Mr. Morris.
-Yes?

41:06.375 --> 41:09.375
Hey, your son Frankie was taken
to Seattle Presbyterian

41:09.458 --> 41:11.166
-because we're a Covid center--
-Oh, my God.

41:11.250 --> 41:14.041
No, they are understaffed,

41:14.125 --> 41:15.542
so they turned away his ambulance.

41:15.625 --> 41:17.291
-Are you kidding me?
-I've been in touch with my husband,

41:17.375 --> 41:18.500
who is a first responder.

41:18.583 --> 41:20.125
They're bringing him back here.

41:20.208 --> 41:22.834
He is stable, right?
He should be here momentarily.

41:22.917 --> 41:24.250
Oh, my God.

41:24.333 --> 41:26.583
-OK. Thank you.
-OK?

41:26.667 --> 41:29.041
-Oh, God.
-[sighs] OK.

41:31.875 --> 41:33.250
Hey, Mr. Bronson said his wife was here,

41:33.333 --> 41:34.333
but I can't find her.

41:34.417 --> 41:37.041
Can you just let her know
that his ORIF went fine?

41:39.583 --> 41:40.959
I hope you're doing OK.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.333
Because I'm not.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.792
I hit 100 this morning.

41:46.917 --> 41:48.917
One hundred times I've had to tell someone

41:49.000 --> 41:50.667
that their loved one has died.

41:50.750 --> 41:52.709
That's 10 times as much as I've had to do

41:52.792 --> 41:53.875
since I started here.

41:53.959 --> 41:55.917
And it's making me wonder how much longer

41:56.000 --> 42:01.709
I can keep doing this
because 100 is a... big number.

42:01.792 --> 42:05.792
And I'm afraid of getting to
a place where it's not so big.

42:05.875 --> 42:07.583
And I know that we're not together,

42:07.667 --> 42:11.333
but you're still a person
that I care about and...

42:11.417 --> 42:12.458
I don't know.

42:12.542 --> 42:15.542
I-I-I thought that you might
want to know how I'm doing.

42:15.625 --> 42:17.458
Which is terrible.

42:18.917 --> 42:20.959
And I really hope that you're OK.

42:25.959 --> 42:26.959
I'm fine.

42:28.417 --> 42:30.375
[Aaron] No, Conor said
Kayden started the fire.

42:30.458 --> 42:32.250
Oh, so it's-- it's his fault?

42:33.250 --> 42:34.625
They shouldn't have even been out there,

42:34.709 --> 42:36.041
but they felt sorry for Frankie.

42:36.125 --> 42:38.000
Wait a minute.
You think that this is Frankie's fault?

42:38.083 --> 42:39.500
Posting all the time about how sad he is

42:39.583 --> 42:40.625
he can't be with his friends.

42:40.709 --> 42:42.834
He missed a year of school
when he was sick.

42:42.917 --> 42:44.709
Of course he wanted to see his friends.

42:44.792 --> 42:47.208
And, hey, I don't need a lecture
from Mr. Lakehouse here, OK?

42:47.291 --> 42:48.667
[Bailey] OK, everyone, let's just settle.

42:48.709 --> 42:50.458
We all follow each other on Instagram.

42:50.542 --> 42:52.792
Did you really think we weren't
gonna see you grilling

42:52.875 --> 42:55.250
every night with half the neighborhood?

42:55.333 --> 42:56.834
And no one in masks!

42:56.917 --> 42:58.333
You know, kids learn by example.

42:58.417 --> 43:00.041
Well, Kayden's example is a selfish moron.

43:00.125 --> 43:02.583
-[people gasp]
-[Bailey] Stop, both of you!

43:02.667 --> 43:04.709
-Steve, stop! Cut it out right now!
-Schmitt, call security!

43:04.792 --> 43:08.333
[Meredith] <i>Disaster has a tendency to melt</i>
<i>away everything else in life.</i>

43:08.417 --> 43:10.750
Selfish son of a bitch!

43:12.041 --> 43:12.875
[Deborah] Steve!

43:12.959 --> 43:15.583
[Meredith] <i>So if you want to know</i>
<i>who you'll be in a disaster,</i>

43:15.667 --> 43:18.458
<i>-ask yourself...</i>
-Security!

43:19.542 --> 43:20.583
<i>...who am I now?</i>
