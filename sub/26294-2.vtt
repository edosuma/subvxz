- Let's go!
- It's okay.

11:37.348 --> 11:38.698
You're okay.
- Keep moving.

11:38.741 --> 11:40.569
- Chief, we cleared 22.

11:40.612 --> 11:42.353
Kidd and I are headed to 23.

11:42.397 --> 11:44.051
- Copy that.

11:44.094 --> 11:46.618
Casey, I got Jay Halstead here.

11:46.662 --> 11:48.229
His father lives at 23C.

11:48.272 --> 11:50.361
He's not answering his phone.

11:50.405 --> 11:51.798
Take a look.

11:51.841 --> 11:54.931
- On our way.
Kidd, let's go.

11:56.019 --> 11:57.281
- Hey, Chief.

11:57.325 --> 11:59.370
We pulled three victims
off of 21.

11:59.414 --> 12:01.068
I still got a few more doors
to kick in.

12:01.111 --> 12:02.765
We'll send these down
with Truck.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.985
- Okay, hey, my buddy Otis
is gonna take you

12:05.028 --> 12:06.638
the rest of the way down,
all right?

12:06.682 --> 12:08.075
Just do what he says.

12:08.118 --> 12:09.903
- I gotta get back inside.

12:09.946 --> 12:13.080
You'll be fine.
I promise.

12:13.123 --> 12:15.691
- Be careful.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.954
- All right, everybody,
follow me.

12:17.998 --> 12:19.303
- The stairwell is so smoky.

12:19.347 --> 12:20.957
Are you sure it's okay
to be in here?

12:21.001 --> 12:22.263
- It'll clear up once
we're below the fire.

12:22.306 --> 12:23.394
Let's keep moving.

12:23.438 --> 12:24.874
- It's a long way down.

12:24.918 --> 12:26.093
Can't we take the elevator?

12:26.136 --> 12:27.268
- The elevators aren't safe.

12:27.311 --> 12:28.704
I can hold your baby
if you want.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.097
Hey, buddy.
Hey, little guy.

12:30.140 --> 12:31.794
You wanna come to Otis?

12:31.838 --> 12:33.274
Hey, come on.
Let's go.

12:33.317 --> 12:35.972
- I can carry him.
That's not the point.

12:37.278 --> 12:40.803
- Let's go.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.326
- Folks, we gotta keep
the entrance clear.

12:42.370 --> 12:44.285
I need you to wait
across the street. Come on.

12:44.328 --> 12:46.113
- Let's get two more engine
companies hooked up to hydrants

12:46.156 --> 12:47.897
in case we start
to lose pressure.

12:47.941 --> 12:50.160
And move Truck 40 down
to the corner.

12:50.204 --> 12:52.728
I want to leave a lane open for
ambulances coming and going.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.077
- Copy that, Chief.

12:55.209 --> 12:58.299
- Chief,
we're inside 23C right now.

12:58.342 --> 13:00.823
- Halstead.
- This way.

13:02.172 --> 13:04.392
- Go ahead, Casey.
What'd you find?

13:04.435 --> 13:06.263
- Nothing.
The apartment's empty.

13:06.307 --> 13:08.309
No sign of Mr. Halstead.

13:08.352 --> 13:09.832
- Carry on, Casey.

13:09.876 --> 13:12.400
That's good news, right?

13:12.443 --> 13:15.098
- Yeah, I guess so.
Thanks, Chief.

13:21.713 --> 13:23.890
Hey, man, they just made it
to Dad's apartment.

13:23.933 --> 13:26.066
He's not there.
You hear back from him?

13:26.109 --> 13:27.676
- No.
I just tried his cell again.

13:27.719 --> 13:29.025
Still nothing.
- Same.

13:29.069 --> 13:30.722
You think of anywhere else
he might be?

13:30.766 --> 13:32.028
- Well, the guy likes
to stick to his routines.

13:32.072 --> 13:33.682
You know that.
A walk in the morning,

13:33.725 --> 13:35.162
then home for lunch.
He should be back by now.

13:35.205 --> 13:37.077
- All right, well,
I'm gonna keep an eye out.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.687
You just let me know
if you hear from him.

13:38.730 --> 13:41.255
I'm guessing
he'll call you first.

13:48.044 --> 13:50.873
- He'll turn up.
Old man's a survivor.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.875
- If you want you can
head over there

13:52.919 --> 13:55.095
and join your brother.

13:55.138 --> 13:58.402
- No, but thanks.
I'm good.

13:58.446 --> 14:01.275
Can do more here
as they bring victims in.

14:01.318 --> 14:03.843
- All right.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.893
- I want a secondary search
of the last few floors.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.852
Make sure we found everyone
that was trapped up there.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.505
- Okay, when you get outside,
go across the street,

14:14.549 --> 14:15.985
check in with the paramedics,
okay?

14:16.029 --> 14:18.379
Good work.
Go outside.

14:18.422 --> 14:20.163
Hey.

14:20.207 --> 14:22.296
Where's the woman
with the baby?

14:22.339 --> 14:24.385
- She stepped aside to let
faster people go by.

14:24.428 --> 14:26.300
I didn't see her after that.

14:26.343 --> 14:28.084
- Okay.

14:29.259 --> 14:30.826
Herrmann.
The mom with the baby.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.219
Did you see her
exit the stairwell?

14:32.262 --> 14:35.048
- I thought they were
up front with you.

14:35.091 --> 14:36.963
- We gotta go up and find them.
- Right.

14:37.006 --> 14:39.530
Just let me swap out
my air tank.

14:39.574 --> 14:41.402
- Otis, can you take a look
at these controls?

14:41.445 --> 14:42.751
- I'm not on elevator duty,
Mouch.

14:42.794 --> 14:43.883
- I know,
but the number three car

14:43.926 --> 14:44.927
is still fritzing out.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.407
It was stuck on 18 for a while,

14:46.450 --> 14:49.889
then it went up to 24,
and now it's stopped again.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.107
- The mom.

14:51.151 --> 14:52.804
I told her we couldn't
use the--

14:52.848 --> 14:54.154
God!

14:54.197 --> 14:56.243
Chief, do we have eyes
inside the elevators?

14:56.286 --> 14:58.419
- Camera's out.
- Damn it.

14:58.462 --> 14:59.550
Okay, you go with Hermann,

14:59.594 --> 15:00.551
I'm gonna work
on the elevators,

15:00.595 --> 15:02.075
try a system reboot.

15:02.118 --> 15:04.077
If that mom took her baby
onto the elevator

15:04.120 --> 15:06.340
they could be trapped.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.125
- All units above
the fire floor,

15:09.169 --> 15:10.561
keep your eyes peeled.

15:10.605 --> 15:12.259
We are missing a woman
and a young child.

15:12.302 --> 15:13.521
I want them found.

15:25.185 --> 15:27.709
I need to get up to 24
to check on that elevator.

15:27.752 --> 15:29.319
Can you guys finish
out on this floor?

15:29.363 --> 15:31.408
- Yeah, on it.

15:41.244 --> 15:42.419

15:42.463 --> 15:44.247

and her kid?

15:44.291 --> 15:46.858
- Boden's got companies
searching from 19 on down,

15:46.902 --> 15:48.643
but no sign of them.

15:51.385 --> 15:53.735
Kidd, you and Herrmann
sweep that floor again

15:53.778 --> 15:55.606

go back up for something.

15:55.650 --> 15:56.912
Mouch, come with me

15:56.956 --> 15:59.480
and we'll start
a primary on 24.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.439
- Herrmann.

16:02.483 --> 16:04.267
You're looking a little peaked.

16:04.311 --> 16:06.269
I mean, you sure
you don't want to stop,

16:06.313 --> 16:08.097
take a breather?

16:08.141 --> 16:09.794
- Like hell.

16:09.838 --> 16:13.276
I could do 20 more flights...

16:13.320 --> 16:15.452
And still run circles
around you.

16:15.496 --> 16:17.846
- No doubt.
- Yeah.

16:19.935 --> 16:22.155
Fire department, call out!

16:28.422 --> 16:29.466

we called in.

16:29.510 --> 16:30.902
Name and age unknown.

She looks mid-teens,
second and third degree burns

16:32.861 --> 16:34.210
on her torso, neck, and arms.

16:34.254 --> 16:35.298

16:35.342 --> 16:36.647
Let's take her to Trauma Two,

16:36.691 --> 16:38.171
get her prepped
for a central line,

16:38.214 --> 16:39.911
and call Respiratory.
- You got it.

16:43.698 --> 16:44.916
- That was impressive.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.528
Field intubation.

16:47.571 --> 16:49.747
Her airways were so burned.
I've...

16:49.791 --> 16:52.315
only done that with
high-tech equipment.

16:52.359 --> 16:54.665
Okay.

16:54.709 --> 16:56.798
What's your story?

16:56.841 --> 16:59.192
Because if we're gonna
be partners,

16:59.235 --> 17:01.846
I need to know.

17:01.890 --> 17:04.719
- Yeah, that's fair.

17:04.762 --> 17:07.330
So until last year

17:07.374 --> 17:10.420
I was a surgical resident
at Lakeshore.

17:10.464 --> 17:13.728
- So, you...you went
to med school,

17:13.771 --> 17:16.296
got accepted at a highly
prestigious residency,

17:16.339 --> 17:18.341
and decided...

17:18.385 --> 17:20.343
"Forget all that.
I want to be a CFD paramedic?"

17:20.387 --> 17:22.954
