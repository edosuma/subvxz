00:01.433 --> 00:04.384
Errogination.
This is Wanda. How may I help you?

00:04.982 --> 00:09.419
So my wife loves watching
your films, Mr. Olson.

00:09.486 --> 00:11.387
As foreplay.

00:11.455 --> 00:12.589
She's really very naughty.

00:14.758 --> 00:16.759
Uh, well, it's, uh, our
anniversary coming up,

00:16.827 --> 00:17.961
and I was thinking,

00:18.028 --> 00:20.997
what better gift for
my husband than to...

00:21.065 --> 00:22.532
Make our own movie.

00:22.600 --> 00:26.603
It just gets better
and better, you know?

00:26.670 --> 00:29.272
Filming ourselves has, um,

00:29.340 --> 00:32.575
always been a secret
fantasy of mine.

00:32.643 --> 00:34.677
Right?

00:37.181 --> 00:39.449
Mm.

00:40.351 --> 00:43.987
So I said, ok, you know, but...

00:44.054 --> 00:46.623
It has to be done properly.

00:46.690 --> 00:48.257
You know, tastefully.

00:48.325 --> 00:49.492
Not tacky.

00:49.560 --> 00:50.493
You know,

00:50.561 --> 00:51.794
a bit of class, really.

00:51.862 --> 00:52.996
Classy.

00:53.063 --> 00:54.931
Classy. Classy. Classy.

00:54.999 --> 00:57.266
We do private shoots,
for a fee.

00:57.334 --> 00:59.636
Name your price.

00:59.703 --> 01:02.171
What kind of a theme
are you interested in?

01:02.239 --> 01:04.173
It has to have a storyline,
you know?

01:04.241 --> 01:05.575
I'm... I was...
I was toying with

01:05.643 --> 01:09.078
a, um, a threesome.

01:09.980 --> 01:12.582
Um, I saw, uh, this girl

01:12.650 --> 01:15.685
in some of your films.

01:15.753 --> 01:19.355
And she... she just...
she makes me...

01:20.524 --> 01:22.091
Curious?

01:22.159 --> 01:23.793
Mm-hmm.
Curious is good.

01:23.861 --> 01:24.994
Curious is great.

01:25.062 --> 01:27.330
Ok, well, we got at least
a dozen girls like her,

01:27.398 --> 01:28.598
if not better.

01:28.666 --> 01:31.067
No, um, it has to be this one.

01:31.135 --> 01:34.303
'Cause my wife's picky.
She's very picky.

01:35.673 --> 01:36.939
So, great.

01:37.007 --> 01:38.041
Absolutely.

01:38.108 --> 01:39.709
Ok. Well, uh, why don't
we give her a call,

01:39.777 --> 01:41.110
see if she's in town.
Come with me.

01:41.178 --> 01:42.045
Ok.

01:42.112 --> 01:43.379
And while we're at it,

01:43.447 --> 01:45.214
is there anything else
I can help you with?

01:45.282 --> 01:47.750
You know, we can accommodate
almost any desire.

01:47.818 --> 01:50.453
I've, uh, always wanted
to be tied up.

01:50.521 --> 01:53.523
Bingo.
I love my wife.

01:53.590 --> 01:55.124
Cool. Look at this lot.

01:55.192 --> 01:56.926
Ok...

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:07.171 --> 02:09.572
Hmm...

02:09.639 --> 02:11.307
Any luck with the number?

02:11.375 --> 02:12.542
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
Got it right here.

02:15.713 --> 02:18.147
Is there a problem?

02:18.215 --> 02:20.750
With the number.
Is there a problem?

02:22.152 --> 02:25.121
You know what? I'm gonna be
totally honest with you guys.

02:25.189 --> 02:27.223
She's the one girl
I can't get you.

02:27.291 --> 02:29.092
I mean, she told me that she
wanted to leave the business.

02:29.159 --> 02:30.760
But I can get you
any other girl you'd like.

02:30.828 --> 02:35.098
We have Amber, and I actually think
that you would find Amber...

02:37.167 --> 02:39.802
How much for the real number?

02:39.803 --> 02:46.803
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>

02:47.010 --> 02:51.347
* Dream, send me a sign *

02:51.415 --> 02:54.083
* turn back the clock *

02:54.151 --> 02:56.519

03:03.794 --> 03:09.165

03:15.305 --> 03:16.906
Tied up, hey?

03:16.974 --> 03:18.241
That was an act.

03:18.308 --> 03:19.909
The rest of it was, maybe,

03:19.977 --> 03:21.410
but that bit rang true.

03:21.478 --> 03:22.411
In your dreams.

03:22.479 --> 03:23.412
Abso-bloody-lutely.

03:23.480 --> 03:24.580
Hey. How was the meeting?

03:24.648 --> 03:26.282
It would have been a lot
easier if you'd been there

03:26.350 --> 03:28.184
to show off your
FBI credentials.

03:28.252 --> 03:31.154
An 18-year-old runaway girl
isn't exactly a federal case.

03:31.221 --> 03:33.656
Which is why I would never
ask you to run her number

03:33.724 --> 03:35.424
without a warrant.

03:35.492 --> 03:37.093
Oh, God.

03:37.161 --> 03:39.328
Nice to see you, too, dad.

03:39.396 --> 03:41.697
We're going to have to
postpone this today, darling.

03:41.765 --> 03:43.933
It's my final journalism
project.

03:44.001 --> 03:46.102
I shadow you 2 days,
fly on the wall.

03:46.170 --> 03:47.503
We discussed this months ago.

03:47.571 --> 03:52.241
Yeah, but, you know,
not today and not this case.

03:52.309 --> 03:53.843
And here I was so proud of you.

03:53.911 --> 03:54.777
For what?

03:54.845 --> 03:57.013
For taking on
coach Dawkins' case.

03:58.415 --> 04:00.550
Oh, so you already know
about that, do you?

04:00.617 --> 04:01.918
I wasn't born yesterday, dad.

04:01.985 --> 04:03.319
Don't rub it in.

04:03.387 --> 04:04.854
Oh, coach Dawkins
and his daughter Amy

04:04.922 --> 04:06.889
are waiting for you
in the conference room.

04:06.957 --> 04:08.324
I made them some tea.

04:08.392 --> 04:10.660
So tell me what you know.

04:10.727 --> 04:12.328
You want to protect me

04:12.396 --> 04:14.797
from a case involving
pornography. I get it.

04:14.865 --> 04:16.766
Not about the case.
What did Dawkins tell you?

04:16.834 --> 04:18.801
Actually, it's more
what I got Amy to tell me,

04:18.869 --> 04:21.003
or don't you remember
we used to be friends?

04:21.071 --> 04:22.605
Amy said Molly was abducted.

04:22.673 --> 04:24.173
All right, look.

04:24.241 --> 04:27.410
Missing girl turns up
in the porn trade.

04:27.477 --> 04:29.645
All right?
Find another story.

04:29.713 --> 04:32.849
My ex-coach's daughter
goes missing for 6 months

04:32.916 --> 04:34.350
and he turns to you
to find her?

04:34.418 --> 04:36.586
There is no other story.
Sorry, dad.

04:36.653 --> 04:39.288
No pressure, then.

04:42.526 --> 04:43.459
Hey.

04:43.527 --> 04:45.661
Amy, I can show you around
the place now.

04:46.997 --> 04:48.531
All right.

04:50.100 --> 04:53.703
Olson, he produced this lot.

04:53.770 --> 04:56.272
He says he has no idea
where Molly is,

04:56.340 --> 04:57.707
and I believe him.

04:57.774 --> 05:00.676
Well, has he got a phone number?
Has he got anything?

05:00.744 --> 05:02.111
It was disconnected.

05:02.179 --> 05:05.081
So I got nothing.

05:06.416 --> 05:08.751
I'm sorry, I don't mean to
sound like I'm not grateful

05:08.819 --> 05:11.120
for what you're doing,
it just...

05:11.188 --> 05:14.423
Kills me what my wife would think
if she'd lived to see this.

05:15.726 --> 05:17.526
Well, I think she'd be proud

05:17.594 --> 05:20.630
that's you're not going to stop until
you've got your daughter back.

05:21.965 --> 05:24.166
Why are you doing
all this for me?

05:25.636 --> 05:28.804
Well, it's every father's
worst nightmare.

05:32.509 --> 05:35.077
Loker.

05:35.145 --> 05:37.546
Work your way through this lot.

05:37.614 --> 05:39.148
If you find anything useful,

05:39.216 --> 05:41.017
there's a promotion
in it for one of you.

05:41.084 --> 05:43.019
I'm not really a porn guy.

05:43.086 --> 05:44.120
Don't put me on, Loker.

05:44.187 --> 05:45.421
What does that mean?

05:45.489 --> 05:47.657
He's saying you're lying,
that you love porn.

05:47.724 --> 05:50.459
See, that's 1-love to Torres.

05:50.527 --> 05:52.495
So is that true
about that promotion?

05:52.562 --> 05:53.930
The VP spot, right?

05:53.997 --> 05:56.132
Does it look like I got time to
hang around and talk about it?

05:56.199 --> 05:57.066
But why now?

05:57.134 --> 05:58.467
Foster's in my ear,

05:58.535 --> 06:01.304
talking about overall
efficiency.

06:01.371 --> 06:03.706
One of you two is gonna
get get it off my plate.

06:03.774 --> 06:06.542
By doing what, exactly?

06:06.610 --> 06:08.311
General supervisory work.

06:08.378 --> 06:10.780
You know, it's longer hours,
it's harder work,

06:10.847 --> 06:13.382
but it comes with a personal
part-time assistant.

06:13.450 --> 06:15.551
So I'd be, like,
Loker's superior?

06:15.619 --> 06:17.887
Uh, so, I would get
an assistant?

06:17.955 --> 06:19.488
Well, part-time, right?

06:19.556 --> 06:22.425
All right, now, I want,
uh, memos from each of you,

06:22.492 --> 06:25.661
typewritten, telling me why you
think you're qualified for the job,

06:25.729 --> 06:27.063
all right?
Keep them brief.

06:27.130 --> 06:28.698
Get cracking.

06:30.867 --> 06:33.502
I just want you to know, even though
you've only worked here 2 years,

06:33.570 --> 06:35.004
I would happily work for you.

06:35.072 --> 06:37.006
And I won't let your demotion
from last year

06:37.074 --> 06:39.709
affect the work I do for you
if you're the VP.

06:39.776 --> 06:42.645
Uh, yeah. Besides, I'd never
stab you in the back

06:42.713 --> 06:44.647
for the sake of
a ridiculous competition.

06:44.715 --> 06:47.416
Well, that's a relief.
Me neither.

06:50.253 --> 06:51.654
It's Lacy, right?

06:51.722 --> 06:53.189
Hello, Lacy.
Yeah. Hi.

06:53.256 --> 06:54.991
Uh, it shouldn't take a minute.
It's just a couple questions.

06:55.058 --> 06:55.925
Ok.

06:55.993 --> 06:58.027
You've been in the business
for...

06:58.095 --> 06:59.261
6, 7 months.

06:59.329 --> 07:00.496
All right.

07:01.498 --> 07:05.334
You know her, don't you?

07:05.402 --> 07:07.003
See how she folded her arms?

07:07.070 --> 07:08.437
She got defensive,
pretty quickly.

07:08.505 --> 07:10.673
What's the matter,
you owe her money or something?

07:10.741 --> 07:12.041
I thought this was an audition.

07:12.109 --> 07:13.309
I was told you had
a job for me.

07:13.377 --> 07:16.445
I do have a job for you.
What's the hourly rate?

07:16.513 --> 07:17.513
500.

07:17.581 --> 07:19.115
All right.

07:19.182 --> 07:20.649
There you are.

07:20.717 --> 07:23.285
So, how did you know Molly?

07:23.353 --> 07:25.187
Cassidy? We met on set.

07:25.255 --> 07:27.156
Well, her real name's Molly.

07:27.224 --> 07:29.425
Whatever. I was getting away
from a violent boyfriend.

07:29.493 --> 07:32.628
She needed a roommate.
We moved in together for a while.

07:32.696 --> 07:34.397
When did you last see her?

07:34.464 --> 07:36.866
She got out of the business
a few months ago,

07:36.933 --> 07:38.367
dropped off the planet.

07:38.435 --> 07:39.769
Any idea where she went?

07:39.836 --> 07:42.738
I don't know.
She kept to herself.

07:42.806 --> 07:45.074
Two kinds of girls
who do this...

07:45.142 --> 07:47.576
girls who like sex
and girls who...

07:47.644 --> 07:49.378
Uh...

07:49.446 --> 07:50.713
Girls who what?

07:50.781 --> 07:53.582
Who are repeating abuse
patterns from their childhood.

07:53.650 --> 07:56.819
Did she ever talk to you
about her childhood?

07:56.887 --> 07:58.421
She didn't have to.

07:58.488 --> 07:59.889
Meaning?

07:59.956 --> 08:01.624
Meaning it was too painful.

08:01.691 --> 08:03.492
Trust me on that.

08:09.032 --> 08:11.801
You said you'd been in the
business for what, 6, 7 months?

08:11.868 --> 08:15.438
Any idea what your shelf
life's gonna be, you know?

08:15.505 --> 08:17.807
I mean, do you have
any thoughts on that?

08:17.874 --> 08:21.243
No. But thank you.
It's so great to know that you care.

08:26.983 --> 08:29.351
What do you think
happened to Molly?

08:29.419 --> 08:30.853
I already told you.

08:30.921 --> 08:33.355
Someone took her away from me,

08:33.423 --> 08:35.357
against her will.

08:35.424 --> 08:38.360
She ran away,
didn't she, coach?

08:40.030 --> 08:42.832
I know what you're thinking,
but you're wrong.

08:44.167 --> 08:46.902
I am a good father,

08:46.970 --> 08:49.438
to Molly and Amy.

08:49.506 --> 08:53.442
Well, say it, then.

08:56.980 --> 09:02.384
I never ever molested
my daughter Molly or Amy.

09:05.422 --> 09:08.457
Well, I believe that.

09:08.525 --> 09:11.026
But you're hiding something.

09:11.094 --> 09:14.296
Something that put
that guilt in your eyes

09:14.364 --> 09:15.631
and in those fists.

09:18.034 --> 09:20.202
You did something

09:20.270 --> 09:23.305
that made your daughter
run away.

09:26.944 --> 09:28.144
Ever since Molly went missing,

09:28.212 --> 09:31.280
my dad's barely let me
out of his sight for one minute.

09:31.347 --> 09:34.216
My dad's going
to find her, Amy.

09:34.284 --> 09:37.019
I miss her so much.

09:37.086 --> 09:38.620
Let's go, darlin'.

09:38.688 --> 09:42.991
They've done all
they can do for us here.

09:43.059 --> 09:44.793
Come on, Amy, let's go.

09:44.861 --> 09:47.196
I don't understand.

09:47.263 --> 09:49.465
Excuse me.

09:49.532 --> 09:50.599
Dad, what just happened?

09:50.667 --> 09:51.767
Just give them some room.

09:51.835 --> 09:53.268
Amy, why do you think
Molly left?

09:53.336 --> 09:56.605
She didn't leave.
Someone took her.

09:56.673 --> 09:59.074
Now, your dad knows that that's
not true, don't you, coach?

09:59.142 --> 10:00.542
He's thinks I'm responsible

10:00.610 --> 10:02.611
for what happened to her.

10:02.679 --> 10:05.314
Please. Molly put my dad
through hell.

10:05.381 --> 10:08.350
Stealing the car
when she was 14,

10:08.418 --> 10:10.652
cutting class all the time,
you name it.

10:10.720 --> 10:14.256
And he never raised his voice
at her, not once.

10:14.324 --> 10:18.026
So don't you dare blame him
for any of this.

10:18.094 --> 10:20.496
It's too late for that,
sweetheart.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.468
So he didn't abuse Molly
or anything?

10:26.536 --> 10:28.303
Zero signs of guilt
when the subject came up.

10:28.371 --> 10:30.005
Yeah. Otherwise it would
have been a police matter,

10:30.073 --> 10:32.140
right, and you'd be at home
right now doing your homework,

10:32.208 --> 10:33.675
which is where
you should be, by the way.

10:33.743 --> 10:35.177
Well, thank you, dad.

10:35.245 --> 10:36.678
For what, exactly?

10:36.746 --> 10:38.280
For letting me
be there for Amy.

10:38.348 --> 10:40.415
Right, as a friend,

10:40.483 --> 10:41.650
not as an employee,

10:41.718 --> 10:43.185
so don't get the two
confused, all right?

10:43.253 --> 10:45.320
You know, Lightman,
that was a fun

10:45.388 --> 10:46.822
little wild goose chase
you sent me on

10:46.890 --> 10:48.690
with that disconnected
cell phone number.

10:48.758 --> 10:51.159
It used to be billed
to a P.O. box, so,

10:51.227 --> 10:53.495
I called all the regional hospitals
and gave them both names...

10:53.563 --> 10:55.264
Cassidy Dawkins
and Molly Dawkins.

10:55.331 --> 10:56.965
The medical bill
from Bethesda hospital

10:57.033 --> 10:59.701
was billed to Cassidy
at that address.

10:59.769 --> 11:02.604
Well, I always said the FBI
was just a bunch of puppies.

11:02.672 --> 11:04.306
Uh, that would be you, dad.

11:04.374 --> 11:06.008
Down.

11:25.795 --> 11:27.963
I'll be right back.

11:30.600 --> 11:33.402
Hey! Hey, hey!

11:33.469 --> 11:35.737
Freeze! Freeze!

11:40.476 --> 11:41.610
How do you do?

11:47.650 --> 11:49.318
Nice.

11:51.821 --> 11:53.555
Hey, you guys.

11:53.623 --> 11:56.992
I'm looking for my friend
Molly Dawkins.

11:57.060 --> 11:58.994
Anybody here
know Molly Dawkins?

11:59.062 --> 12:02.197
How about Cassidy Dawkins?

12:04.968 --> 12:08.070
Thank you very much.
You've been a great help.

12:10.807 --> 12:12.441
Uhh! Let go!

12:12.508 --> 12:14.776
This is my house!
I got rights!

12:14.844 --> 12:16.211
Yeah, right.

12:17.914 --> 12:19.781
You must be the owner.

12:19.849 --> 12:21.450
Yeah, who wants to know?

12:21.517 --> 12:22.884
FBI.

12:22.952 --> 12:24.119
For having a party?

12:24.187 --> 12:25.921
We're looking
for Molly Dawkins.

12:25.989 --> 12:27.389
I don't know no Molly Hawkins.

12:27.457 --> 12:28.790
Don't get clever, all right?

12:28.858 --> 12:29.791
Not in them shoes.

12:29.859 --> 12:32.728
Maybe you know her
as Cassidy Dawkins.

12:32.795 --> 12:34.463
See, I think you people
have the wrong house.

12:34.530 --> 12:36.898
You always run out the back when
somebody knocks on the door?

12:36.966 --> 12:39.401
Yeah. This is harassment.
I'm calling my lawyer.

12:39.469 --> 12:40.602
You running a porn business?

12:40.670 --> 12:41.703
Huh?

12:41.771 --> 12:43.038
That's porn for yes.

12:43.106 --> 12:44.139
Porn's not a crime.

12:44.207 --> 12:45.641
Filming it
without a license is.

12:45.708 --> 12:47.976
Cassidy Dawkins.

12:48.044 --> 12:50.112
Upstairs?

12:50.179 --> 12:51.880
Downstairs?

12:51.948 --> 12:52.881
Upstairs it is.

12:52.949 --> 12:53.882
Upstairs it is.

12:53.950 --> 12:56.985
Look, these kids,
they come to me.

12:57.053 --> 12:59.187
They need a safe place to go.

12:59.255 --> 13:01.690
So you're some kind
of social worker, then?

13:01.758 --> 13:03.759
Safe? There
are drugs everywhere.

13:03.826 --> 13:04.860
I give them food,
I give them shelter.

13:04.927 --> 13:06.428
I don't ask for anything
in return.

13:06.496 --> 13:07.596
Carry on.

13:07.664 --> 13:10.098
Yeah, except for the copious
amounts of free sex,

13:10.166 --> 13:11.166
on camera.

13:11.234 --> 13:14.336
Which they're not even
fully conscious for.

13:18.341 --> 13:19.975
Molly?

13:25.415 --> 13:27.182
You all right, darling?

13:27.250 --> 13:29.251
Now would be a good time
for you to call your lawyer.

13:29.318 --> 13:30.919
Molly?

13:30.987 --> 13:31.987
What?
Molly.

13:32.055 --> 13:35.323
Hey, I'm Gillian Foster.
I'm a doctor.

13:35.391 --> 13:36.324
What has she taken?

13:36.392 --> 13:37.826
I don't know.
I didn't give her nothin'.

13:37.894 --> 13:39.194
She asked for a place to crash,

13:39.262 --> 13:41.029
I gave her a place to crash.

13:41.097 --> 13:44.366
Oh, what, so this is
a nanny cam, is it?

13:44.434 --> 13:46.601
I'm gonna get her stuff.

13:47.937 --> 13:49.271
Go on, get out of here.

13:49.338 --> 13:51.673
We're done with you. Go.
Get going.

13:51.741 --> 13:53.341
What do you guys want?

13:53.409 --> 13:55.377
To take you away from here,
to a safe place.

13:55.445 --> 13:57.679
Yeah, I've heard that before.

13:57.747 --> 13:59.181
I'll bet you have.

13:59.248 --> 14:01.550
My dad sent you, didn't he?

14:01.617 --> 14:03.618
Look, I don't ever want to
see that bastard again.

14:03.686 --> 14:04.820
Just leave me alone.

14:04.887 --> 14:05.821
Molly.

14:05.888 --> 14:06.822
Just get out.

14:06.889 --> 14:09.057
Molly, listen to me, ok?

14:09.125 --> 14:10.459
You're in bad shape,

14:10.526 --> 14:11.727
with some bad people.

14:11.794 --> 14:13.729
Now, we can't force you
to leave with us.

14:13.796 --> 14:15.564
Look, at least let us
get you out of here

14:15.631 --> 14:18.567
before the authorities
show up, huh?

14:29.512 --> 14:32.380
Hey. It's my dad's
sweatshirt.

14:32.448 --> 14:34.216
Sorry, it's a little big.

14:34.283 --> 14:35.450
You go to Cal?

14:35.518 --> 14:37.119
I'm applying, but I got that

14:37.186 --> 14:38.787
because my dad's name
is also Cal.

14:38.855 --> 14:40.655
You guys look happy.

14:40.723 --> 14:43.658
We have good days
and not so good days,

14:43.726 --> 14:45.660
but mostly good.

14:46.796 --> 14:47.996
I'm not going back.

14:48.064 --> 14:51.800
Nobody said you had to,
darlin'.

14:51.868 --> 14:53.702
I know that your sister
wishes you would.

14:53.770 --> 14:55.137
You know, she misses you.

14:55.204 --> 14:56.505
So does your dad.

14:56.572 --> 14:59.541
I don't want anything
to do with him.

14:59.609 --> 15:02.444
You want to tell us why not?

15:03.946 --> 15:05.981
I'm not going back, ok?

15:06.048 --> 15:07.816
Ok.

15:07.884 --> 15:09.518
Whatever you're scared of,

15:09.585 --> 15:12.354
I can see it's real to you.

15:17.693 --> 15:18.994
Molly?

15:19.061 --> 15:19.995
What?

15:20.062 --> 15:22.864
Where did you just go?

15:22.932 --> 15:24.166
Nowhere.

15:24.233 --> 15:26.234
You're thinking about
your dad, darling.

15:26.302 --> 15:27.936
How do you know?

15:28.004 --> 15:31.940
I saw the exact same
expression on your dad's face

15:32.008 --> 15:33.775
the other day.

15:35.077 --> 15:36.778
He'll kill me.

15:38.548 --> 15:40.782
You're safe here, Molly,
I promise.

15:40.850 --> 15:41.950
Right, dad?

15:42.018 --> 15:43.819
You got my word on it.

15:45.221 --> 15:48.190
I just... I can't live
like this anymore.

15:48.257 --> 15:49.357
Well, you don't
have to, do you?

15:49.425 --> 15:51.993
I mean, that's why
we went to that dump,

15:52.061 --> 15:54.796
we pulled you out of there, and
then we brought you back here

15:54.864 --> 15:56.898
to my house.

15:56.966 --> 15:58.934
Milk?

15:59.001 --> 16:01.403
Yes, please.

16:04.073 --> 16:05.140
All right.

16:05.208 --> 16:08.643
Let's have it, then.

16:10.813 --> 16:13.081
Out with it.

16:14.650 --> 16:17.752
My dad...

16:17.820 --> 16:20.155
He killed my mom.

16:26.970 --> 16:28.295
My parents argued a lot.

16:29.402 --> 16:31.871
And one night,

16:31.938 --> 16:35.541
I was in my bed
and I heard a scream

16:35.609 --> 16:36.976
and a loud crash.

16:37.043 --> 16:40.446
And when I came out
of my room...

16:40.514 --> 16:43.616
I found my mom...

16:43.683 --> 16:46.519
At the bottom of the stairs.

16:48.622 --> 16:53.092
And my dad was just running
around cleaning something up.

16:53.160 --> 16:56.729
He wasn't even checking on her.

17:00.066 --> 17:02.168
When the police came,

17:02.235 --> 17:06.638
he said that it was
just an accident.

17:06.705 --> 17:08.207
How old were you?

17:08.275 --> 17:09.809
5.

17:09.876 --> 17:11.777
You buried the memory?

17:11.845 --> 17:13.444
Yeah. Until a year ago.

17:13.512 --> 17:16.448
My boyfriend and I
got in a big fight

17:16.516 --> 17:18.184
and it all just started
to come back.

17:18.251 --> 17:20.486
You've never told anyone?

17:21.621 --> 17:23.289
I'm not saying it was
the right thing to do.

17:23.356 --> 17:24.857
I mean, I'm not proud of that,

17:24.925 --> 17:28.093
but I just knew that
I had to get out of where I was.

17:31.164 --> 17:33.098
Did you actually see your dad

17:33.166 --> 17:35.100
push your mom down the stairs?

17:35.168 --> 17:36.535
I was there.

17:36.603 --> 17:38.204
Granted. But...

17:38.271 --> 17:39.872
It was a long time ago, right?

17:39.940 --> 17:42.308
I saw him do it.

17:42.375 --> 17:45.878
Are you sure what you saw wasn't
something that you just pieced together

17:45.946 --> 17:47.546
in the confusion
of what was happening?

17:47.614 --> 17:49.982
I know what I know.

17:50.050 --> 17:53.819
You know, I think it's time
we leaned a little harder

17:53.887 --> 17:57.056
on your dad, don't you?

17:59.693 --> 18:02.328
Your wife's neck
was broken 14 years ago,

18:02.395 --> 18:04.330
and your daughter describes you

18:04.397 --> 18:05.831
as running around
like a headless chicken.

18:05.899 --> 18:07.499
I want to see my daughter.

18:07.567 --> 18:09.301
He just accused you
of murder, coach.

18:09.369 --> 18:10.970
Put your hands
behind your back.

18:11.037 --> 18:13.672
Which means that
the next time you see Molly

18:13.740 --> 18:15.174
will be in a courtroom.

18:15.242 --> 18:16.675
Listen, my wife died.

18:16.743 --> 18:18.244
She broke her neck.
It was an accident.

18:18.311 --> 18:19.745
It's all in the police report.

18:19.813 --> 18:22.014
You think I killed my wife?
That's why Molly ran away?

18:22.082 --> 18:23.415
Did you argue
with her that night?

18:23.483 --> 18:24.950
That's ridiculous.

18:25.018 --> 18:26.785
Did you hit her? Did you
Chuck her down the stairs?

18:26.853 --> 18:28.354
I said I want to see
my daughter!

18:28.421 --> 18:30.256
Amy will be placed in protective
services until we figure this out.

18:30.323 --> 18:31.290
Have a seat.

18:31.358 --> 18:33.259
You can't do this.
You can't take Amy away.

18:33.326 --> 18:35.628
Yeah, he can, actually.

18:37.664 --> 18:39.498
Yeah, this is Agent
Ben Reynolds.

18:39.566 --> 18:42.301
I need child protective
services at 2270 story street.

18:42.369 --> 18:44.670
Please, I can't lose Amy, too!

18:46.239 --> 18:48.574
So you really think this will
get him to talk, huh?

18:48.642 --> 18:50.075
I don't know. It's worth
a shot, though, right?

18:50.143 --> 18:52.344
Well, right now all we have
is Molly's confused memory

18:52.412 --> 18:54.580
about what happened
14 years ago.

18:54.648 --> 18:56.615
If this guy even thinks
lawyer, we're screwed.

18:56.683 --> 18:58.418
Well, I'm banking on him
wanting to protect his kids.

18:58.486 --> 19:00.353
Dad!
Amy!

19:00.421 --> 19:02.022
Here we go.
Dad!

19:02.089 --> 19:04.224
Just calm down. Just relax.
Relax, relax, relax.

19:04.292 --> 19:05.792
Relax, it's gonna be fine.
You can't take him.

19:05.860 --> 19:06.993
Amy!

19:07.061 --> 19:08.895
It's gonna be just fine.
We just want to talk to him.

19:08.963 --> 19:10.697
It's ok. Come on.
Let's get you in the house.

19:10.765 --> 19:12.565
It's ok.

19:16.003 --> 19:17.404
What's the matter?

19:17.471 --> 19:19.572
You tell me. I mean,

19:19.640 --> 19:22.075
who's gonna love
somebody who...

19:23.945 --> 19:26.680
Who what, Molly?

19:28.883 --> 19:31.051
Just somebody like me.

19:31.118 --> 19:33.353
Someone like you?

19:33.821 --> 19:35.621
You mean an ex-actress?

19:35.689 --> 19:37.590
Ex-porn slut.

19:37.658 --> 19:39.692
Just say it in plain English.

19:39.760 --> 19:43.429
No one has to know about
what you were doing before.

19:43.497 --> 19:46.799
I mean, past is past, and I
won't tell anyone. Will you?

19:48.168 --> 19:49.769
You're sweet.

19:49.837 --> 19:51.571
No so much.

19:54.108 --> 19:56.142
I think you'd make
a good sister.

19:56.210 --> 19:57.777
Well, so would you.

19:57.845 --> 20:00.847
But more importantly,
so would Amy,

20:00.914 --> 20:02.548
if you let her.

20:07.388 --> 20:09.188
She's protecting something,

20:09.256 --> 20:13.126
something deeper
that's eating away at her.

20:13.193 --> 20:15.828
She's got so much pain.

20:17.798 --> 20:19.899
You make her feel better.

20:19.967 --> 20:22.068
I'm just talking to her.

20:22.136 --> 20:24.904
And she hasn't had that
in a long time.

20:24.972 --> 20:28.241
I mean, maybe my dad's right.

20:28.308 --> 20:31.043
I'm not ready for this.

20:31.111 --> 20:32.979
Your dad isn't always right.

20:33.046 --> 20:36.315
I just...I didn't realize
it was gonna be

20:36.383 --> 20:39.218
quite like this.

20:39.286 --> 20:41.454
Yeah.

20:41.522 --> 20:45.491
I've known girls at school
like her, but...

20:45.559 --> 20:46.993
Only from a distance.

20:47.060 --> 20:50.463
Keeping you close by might
help her feel more comfortable

20:50.531 --> 20:51.931
about opening up.

20:51.999 --> 20:54.567
Really?

21:08.949 --> 21:10.216
"A born leader"?

21:10.284 --> 21:12.051
Really? Your mommy
tell you that?

21:12.119 --> 21:14.220
Ha ha. That's funny.

21:14.288 --> 21:15.555
You can hate all you want,

21:15.622 --> 21:17.390
but I'm getting this promotion.

21:17.458 --> 21:19.058
What? What could you
possibly have over me?

21:19.126 --> 21:21.127
I'm a natural. Remember?

21:21.195 --> 21:22.361
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

21:22.429 --> 21:24.464
So you're saying that
you've accomplished nothing

21:24.531 --> 21:26.032
aside from just being born.

21:26.099 --> 21:30.503
Look, we're both
good candidates for this job.

21:30.571 --> 21:33.739
That's a nice try with
the politician's touch.

21:33.807 --> 21:35.975
Politician's touch?
You just made that up.

21:36.043 --> 21:36.976
I did?

21:37.044 --> 21:38.211
Hmm.
Uh-huh.

21:39.646 --> 21:41.380
A calculated gesture

21:41.448 --> 21:44.283
to convince opponents
that they're wrong,

21:44.351 --> 21:45.718
yet still be reasonable
about it.

21:45.786 --> 21:47.653
We're all on
the same side here.

21:47.721 --> 21:50.156
Ok, look, I tried to work you.

21:50.224 --> 21:51.791
Sorry. This is not...

21:51.859 --> 21:54.160
You know, maybe
that is Lightman's game.

21:54.228 --> 21:55.828
He pits us against each other

21:55.896 --> 21:58.164
just to see who emerges alive.

21:58.232 --> 22:00.366
Well, then let's not
play his game.

22:00.434 --> 22:01.934
Let's do this our way.

22:02.002 --> 22:05.037
Better yet...

22:05.105 --> 22:08.641
Let's just not play at all.

22:08.709 --> 22:12.678
What would he least
expect us to do?

22:15.349 --> 22:17.884
You buy the first round
after work.

22:17.951 --> 22:19.218
No, just expense it.

22:19.286 --> 22:20.486
To be a VP,

22:20.554 --> 22:22.855
you gotta act like one.

22:29.730 --> 22:32.231
Molly, I need you
to do something for me.

22:32.299 --> 22:33.799
Look, I'm really tired.

22:33.867 --> 22:35.301
Look, I just want you
to picture

22:35.369 --> 22:37.703
if your sister were here
with us right now.

22:37.771 --> 22:39.138
Ok?

22:39.206 --> 22:44.043
What's the most important thing
that you'd want her to know?

22:44.111 --> 22:47.346
That I'm not coming home.

22:47.414 --> 22:50.082
That I can't.

22:51.151 --> 22:52.919
Hey. Uh, here you go.

22:52.986 --> 22:56.856
Uh, sorry. If you'd rather, I can
get you a big t-shirt or something.

22:56.924 --> 22:58.991
No, it's great.
Thank you.

23:10.237 --> 23:12.271
If I were to tell Amy
something,

23:12.339 --> 23:15.608
it would be that...

23:15.676 --> 23:17.910
I think it would be better
if she never saw me again.

23:17.978 --> 23:20.446
Why would you say that, Molly?

23:20.514 --> 23:22.615
Because I'm toxic.

23:24.685 --> 23:27.520
Molly, this secret
you're keeping,

23:27.588 --> 23:31.557
whatever it is,
you need to get it out.

23:33.860 --> 23:35.795
Ok, just forget it, ok?

23:35.862 --> 23:37.229
I really... I can't do this.

23:37.297 --> 23:39.565
You're doing great.

23:39.633 --> 23:41.300
Please.

23:43.437 --> 23:46.806
Do you feel like
if you don't talk about it,

23:46.873 --> 23:50.743
that...maybe
it never happened?

23:50.811 --> 23:53.446
Yeah.

23:53.513 --> 23:57.783
You shouldn't have to
cope with this on your own.

24:04.925 --> 24:07.893
I'm HIV-positive.

24:10.664 --> 24:13.799
Oh, my God, I...
That...

24:15.168 --> 24:18.604
Sucks. Yeah.

24:18.672 --> 24:21.107
Are you getting treatment?

24:21.174 --> 24:23.442
On and off.

24:23.510 --> 24:26.045
You know what
the worst part is?

24:26.113 --> 24:29.382
I never even had sex,
except for those scenes I did.

24:30.684 --> 24:32.318
Never shot up.

24:32.386 --> 24:34.754
We will get you
the proper care.

24:36.757 --> 24:42.561
Well...My life's never
going to be normal again.

24:51.501 --> 24:52.568
Corporate culture?

24:52.636 --> 24:54.303
There's what, like
20 people in our office

24:54.371 --> 24:55.671
and it feels like
nobody knows each other.

24:55.739 --> 24:58.240
That's what a VP
should be fixing.

24:58.308 --> 25:02.678
Social networks recede with age
in a lot of primate species.

25:02.746 --> 25:05.381
Maybe we should
get to know each other.

25:06.950 --> 25:10.352
Ok. All right.
Let's play 2 truths and a lie.

25:10.420 --> 25:12.254
Ok.

25:12.322 --> 25:14.156
Um...

25:14.224 --> 25:17.259
I have a gun in my nightstand.

25:17.327 --> 25:21.964
I was 18 the first time I slept
with someone twice my age.

25:22.032 --> 25:23.198
And I love videos

25:23.266 --> 25:26.535
of kittens climbing up
slides or out of buckets.

25:28.338 --> 25:29.405
Middle one is a lie.

25:29.472 --> 25:33.742
Right..
Right. I was 19.

25:33.810 --> 25:35.611
Ok, um...

25:35.679 --> 25:38.480
This job changed my life.

25:38.548 --> 25:41.650
My favorite food is mustard.

25:41.718 --> 25:45.087
And I sleep naked most nights.

25:45.155 --> 25:47.323
Oh, the second one.
Please be the second.

25:48.458 --> 25:51.126
I love mustard.
How do you not know that?

25:51.194 --> 25:53.729
I just always pictured you
as a naked sleeper.

25:53.797 --> 25:55.564
Thong and a tank top.

25:55.632 --> 25:57.299
Hmm.

25:57.367 --> 25:58.667
You know, after tomorrow,

25:58.735 --> 26:00.502
you're going to have to talk
to me through my assistant.

26:00.570 --> 26:02.404
Your turn.
Uh-uh.

26:03.340 --> 26:05.407
Let's see.

26:05.475 --> 26:06.608
I sing in the shower.

26:06.676 --> 26:08.110
Billy Joel.
Hmm.

26:09.479 --> 26:13.015
Um...My last girlfriend
left me for a friend of mine

26:13.083 --> 26:16.085
and I didn't even
see it coming.

26:16.152 --> 26:18.821
Uh, and, uh...

26:18.888 --> 26:23.025
I would really like
to kiss you right now.

26:26.096 --> 26:28.030
They're all true.

26:29.866 --> 26:32.267
* Baby *

26:32.335 --> 26:35.637
* I look around *

26:35.705 --> 26:38.941
* with a... *

26:39.009 --> 26:41.243
* like you are mine *

26:42.345 --> 26:43.946
I should be in there with you.

26:44.014 --> 26:46.448
No, I've got this one.
He thinks he's under arrest.

26:46.516 --> 26:48.267
Just stay close, all right?

26:49.919 --> 26:51.453
How's he doing?

26:51.521 --> 26:54.056
He hasn't said a word,
so he hasn't asked for anything

26:54.124 --> 26:55.457
and he hasn't moved.

26:56.559 --> 26:59.962
Hey, if Molly got HIV
in these films,

27:00.030 --> 27:01.830
then doesn't that mean
there are others

27:01.898 --> 27:03.165
that must be infected?

27:03.233 --> 27:05.734
And whoever infected her
is probably still out there.

27:05.802 --> 27:08.504
Look, everyone that makes these
videos has to get tested,

27:08.571 --> 27:11.573
so if somebody knowingly transmitted
HIV to Molly, that's a crime.

27:11.641 --> 27:14.410
If the producers, crew,
or anyone else was involved,

27:14.477 --> 27:15.778
then that's a crime, too.

27:15.845 --> 27:18.514
They should shut them
down, all of them.

27:18.581 --> 27:20.716
Yeah, right now.

27:20.784 --> 27:22.351
Oh, thanks, darling.

27:42.505 --> 27:44.039
Now what?

27:52.949 --> 27:54.716
Molly's HIV.

27:54.784 --> 27:57.953
What? Where is she?
Is she...

27:58.021 --> 28:00.756
I have to go see her.
Please, please let me see her.

28:00.824 --> 28:04.159
She don't want
to see you right now.

28:04.227 --> 28:07.563
And there's nothing
I can do about that

28:07.630 --> 28:10.032
until I know what's going on.

28:10.100 --> 28:12.501
Is she being taken care of?
Has she got a doctor?

28:12.569 --> 28:14.236
Yes.

28:14.304 --> 28:16.238
And yes.

28:16.306 --> 28:20.576
But she's going to need
a little bit more than that.

28:20.643 --> 28:22.277
Meaning?

28:22.345 --> 28:24.880
You know what I mean.

28:28.218 --> 28:32.321
Oh, man, you got no idea
what you're asking me to do.

28:32.388 --> 28:36.992
Look, if I'm gonna put you

28:37.060 --> 28:39.761
in a room with Molly
against her will,

28:39.829 --> 28:43.999
I'm gonna need a solid reason.

28:44.934 --> 28:47.769
You'd do that?

28:56.112 --> 28:58.447
Well, I can't help you, then.

29:01.384 --> 29:05.754
My wife and I were going
through a rough patch.

29:07.290 --> 29:11.827
There was two kids
and, uh, it was hard.

29:13.296 --> 29:19.168
And Molly would watch TV
while Helen and I fought.

29:19.235 --> 29:23.405
The same cartoon
over and over, and, uh...

29:23.473 --> 29:26.275
The damn monkey...

29:26.342 --> 29:30.445
That would leave things out
for people to slip on.

29:30.513 --> 29:35.817
And Molly copied every
little thing that monkey did.

29:37.453 --> 29:42.024
She started leaving toys out
all over the house,

29:42.091 --> 29:46.495
and we told her, you know,
somebody's going to get hurt.

29:46.563 --> 29:49.631
But she just kept doing it.

29:53.670 --> 29:56.004
Your wife fell.

29:56.072 --> 29:58.740
Yeah.

29:58.808 --> 30:02.010
She broke her neck.

30:02.078 --> 30:04.947
And you hid this.

30:05.014 --> 30:08.550
She was just a little girl.

30:09.786 --> 30:12.521
I didn't want her
to live her whole life

30:12.589 --> 30:15.557
with her mom's blood
on her hands.

30:25.077 --> 30:27.578
So you want Molly
to keep believing

30:27.946 --> 30:29.580
that dad killed our mom?

30:29.648 --> 30:31.916
I don't think the truth's
going to help your sister.

30:31.983 --> 30:34.051
I mean, not in this case.

30:34.119 --> 30:37.988
She barely has the coping skills
to deal with her illness.

30:38.056 --> 30:41.058
Now imagine if she knew the
truth about your mom's death.

30:41.126 --> 30:43.961
But she was just a kid.
It's not her fault.

30:44.029 --> 30:45.496
I know. I agree with you.

30:45.564 --> 30:48.165
But after all she's put you
and your father through,

30:48.233 --> 30:51.202
the guilt could send her
into another tailspin.

30:52.037 --> 30:54.305
Well, what do I tell her?

30:54.372 --> 30:56.273
How old are you?

30:56.341 --> 30:57.441
16.

30:57.509 --> 30:59.310
Right. I was 2 years
older than you

30:59.377 --> 31:00.911
when my mom killed herself.

31:00.979 --> 31:02.012
Pills.

31:02.080 --> 31:04.215
I'm sorry.

31:04.282 --> 31:05.282
It happens.

31:05.350 --> 31:06.717
The doctors, they said to me,

31:06.785 --> 31:08.652
it's not your fault.

31:08.720 --> 31:11.522
But I still, to this day,

31:11.590 --> 31:14.558
think that I should have
seen that one coming.

31:14.626 --> 31:20.364
Now, what if they'd
said to me that...

31:20.432 --> 31:24.535
She'd died of a stroke
or something?

31:24.603 --> 31:26.971
That, you know,
she'd died peacefully?

31:29.074 --> 31:33.744
Molly needs a believable explanation
for what she remembers.

31:33.812 --> 31:36.680
So, what,
you're gonna lie to her?

31:36.748 --> 31:39.016
I'm gonna get her
back with her dad.

31:44.456 --> 31:47.491
I think that I have an idea.

31:54.733 --> 31:57.134
Good morning.

31:57.202 --> 31:59.370
Great morning.

31:59.437 --> 32:01.672
Oh, hey, Lightman was looking
for that DVD from yesterday.

32:01.740 --> 32:03.440
Do you have it?

32:05.710 --> 32:08.445
Why are you doing that thing where you
act like nothing happened last night?

32:08.513 --> 32:11.515
I'm being professional.
We're colleagues.

32:11.583 --> 32:13.517
Can't you be professional?

32:13.585 --> 32:15.019
Oh, yes, absolutely.

32:15.086 --> 32:16.987
Yes, I can. In fact,

32:17.055 --> 32:20.591
let me return this to you
in a professional manner.

32:20.659 --> 32:22.826
Did you lose something
last night,

32:22.894 --> 32:24.061
colleague?

32:25.964 --> 32:26.930
What?

32:26.998 --> 32:28.899
Hmm? Nothing.

32:28.967 --> 32:31.502
You two are so gonna
have to do better than that.

32:31.569 --> 32:34.204
I'm not even a scientist
and I can tell.

32:34.272 --> 32:35.406
Thank you, Anna.

32:35.473 --> 32:38.342
Are they bringing in a new VP?

32:38.410 --> 32:40.044
There's a rumor going around.

32:40.111 --> 32:41.278
What? What rumor?
Who said that?

32:41.346 --> 32:42.379
No one.

32:42.447 --> 32:43.347
Everyone.

32:43.415 --> 32:44.648
I'm sorry.

32:44.716 --> 32:47.651
Maybe they're gonna
promote one of you.

32:50.889 --> 32:53.824
I'll leave now.

32:55.727 --> 32:59.063
You should give it back to
her now, whatever it is.

33:04.869 --> 33:07.371
So, uh,

33:07.439 --> 33:12.309
last night's...Thing, um,

33:12.377 --> 33:13.844
it's off the table.

33:13.912 --> 33:17.614
Yeah, definitely.

33:17.682 --> 33:20.417
But I was thinking,
what if neither of us

33:20.485 --> 33:21.652
takes the promotion?

33:21.720 --> 33:24.154
Well, maybe
last night only happened

33:24.222 --> 33:27.057
because something's
about to change.

33:27.125 --> 33:29.793
Or maybe last night
is more important

33:29.861 --> 33:32.129
than a promotion.

33:33.431 --> 33:36.367
If you turn down the promotion
and he offers it to me,

33:36.434 --> 33:38.369
I'll take it.

33:38.436 --> 33:40.971
I'm sorry, but it's true.

33:46.811 --> 33:48.379
Molly was infected on your set.

33:48.446 --> 33:50.781
Look, I run a clean operation.

33:50.849 --> 33:54.184
Everyone is legal, consenting,
and HIV-negative.

33:54.252 --> 33:55.853
4 actresses from your movies

33:55.920 --> 33:58.722
have been infected with
HIV in the last year.

33:58.790 --> 34:00.324
You know, this my come
as a shock to you,

34:00.392 --> 34:04.428
but, uh, some porn stars, they
catch the virus on their own dime.

34:04.496 --> 34:07.131
If you knowingly
exposed Molly to HIV,

34:07.198 --> 34:09.366
then you're going to jail.

34:09.434 --> 34:10.768
Why would I do that?

34:10.835 --> 34:12.101
I'm a businessman.

34:12.170 --> 34:13.971
Let me explain
something to you.

34:14.038 --> 34:15.339
I'm about to subpoena
everybody you've worked with

34:15.407 --> 34:16.974
in the last 5 years.

34:17.041 --> 34:18.409
So how's that for business?

34:18.476 --> 34:20.444
An 18-year-old kid
just found out that at best

34:20.512 --> 34:23.045
she's going to live out the rest of
her days fighting to stay healthy,

34:23.114 --> 34:24.915
and at worst,
she's going to die young.

34:24.983 --> 34:26.516
We want a list
of all the actors

34:26.583 --> 34:28.719
that Molly and the other
HIV-positive girls have worked with.

34:28.786 --> 34:33.389
Their real names, their
addresses, phone numbers.

34:36.094 --> 34:39.496
All you had to do was ask.

34:40.732 --> 34:42.733
So, you're saying

34:42.801 --> 34:44.701
that you don't remember
any of them.

34:44.768 --> 34:47.204
What can I say?

34:47.272 --> 34:48.806
Ass kind of runs together
after a while.

34:48.873 --> 34:50.607
Well, you know, Olson says

34:50.675 --> 34:52.443
that you worked with
all 4 of these actresses.

34:52.510 --> 34:55.779
And since then, all 4 of them
have tested positive for HIV.

34:55.847 --> 34:59.650
Now, I'm doing the math and
it all adds up the same way.

34:59.717 --> 35:02.352
I get checked
before every shoot.

35:02.420 --> 35:04.288
It's just what you do.

35:04.355 --> 35:05.556
You hear that raised pitch?

35:05.623 --> 35:06.790
He's really the guy?

35:06.858 --> 35:08.525
So you're telling us
that you're disease free?

35:08.593 --> 35:10.294
Right.

35:15.233 --> 35:16.900
What's is like?

35:16.968 --> 35:19.503
I mean, really, how's it feel

35:19.571 --> 35:23.240
to give 4 girls potentially
a death sentence?

35:23.308 --> 35:25.075
What's that like?

35:25.143 --> 35:29.146
Look, I'm sorry if some of
these girls got sick.

35:29.214 --> 35:30.280
No, you're not.

35:30.348 --> 35:31.515
He's not, you know.

35:31.583 --> 35:32.616
Yeah, I know.

35:32.684 --> 35:33.817
There's not a shred
of remorse there.

35:33.885 --> 35:37.354
I've got nothing
to be remorseful for.

35:37.422 --> 35:39.423
You want proof.

35:39.491 --> 35:43.694
Now, how could I be lying

35:43.761 --> 35:46.663
if my blood test from last
week says that I'm clean?

35:56.674 --> 35:58.609
Thank you for this.

35:58.676 --> 36:00.143
For what?

36:00.211 --> 36:02.779
For being as dumb as you look.

36:11.772 --> 36:14.040
Thanks for taking
the time, doctor.

36:14.107 --> 36:16.342
You said Fentris
gave you my name?

36:16.410 --> 36:18.711
Yeah, he said, um,
you know, you could,

36:18.779 --> 36:19.712
you know, give me a hand,
you know,

36:19.780 --> 36:20.880
with my little problem.

36:20.947 --> 36:23.149
You know, itchy.
Get my drift?

36:23.216 --> 36:24.985
I'm sure Fentris told you
I don't take insurance.

36:25.053 --> 36:27.454
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cash, cash.
Cash up front, right?

36:27.522 --> 36:30.223
Uh, look, one question
for you, though.

36:30.825 --> 36:34.332
Did you charge
these girls extra?

36:36.098 --> 36:37.133
I don't follow.

36:37.253 --> 36:39.191
You have no idea
who these people are, do you?

36:39.311 --> 36:40.734
Should I?

36:40.802 --> 36:42.569
No. You've never seen them
before in your life.

36:42.637 --> 36:44.071
But funny thing is, right,

36:44.138 --> 36:45.972
if one of them dies,

36:46.372 --> 36:49.111
you're going to jail
for murder.

36:49.231 --> 36:50.115
Wacky.

36:51.164 --> 36:54.192
Ok, I don't know what your deal is,
but I think you should leave.

36:54.692 --> 36:57.675
Here you go.
This is FBI Agent

36:57.795 --> 37:00.754
Ben Reynolds.
He's got an itch, too.

37:00.874 --> 37:02.489
If you even try and deny

37:02.557 --> 37:06.101
that you gave Lee Fentris a free
pass to infect those girls,

37:06.221 --> 37:07.327
I'm gonna rip your throat out.

37:07.891 --> 37:09.608
Open wide.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.707
All right, get up.
You're under arrest.

37:11.827 --> 37:13.227
What for?
I didn't do anything.

37:13.284 --> 37:14.434
You're HIV-positive.

37:15.251 --> 37:17.536
Your doctor's been
falsifying your papers.

37:17.656 --> 37:19.106
You've been that way
for 2 years.

37:19.173 --> 37:21.402
That's attempted murder.
Let's go.

37:22.910 --> 37:24.044
This way.

37:24.112 --> 37:25.145
People like you,

37:25.213 --> 37:27.447
you think we're all
living in sleaze.

37:27.515 --> 37:30.617
Not true.
I had a good life.

37:30.685 --> 37:31.885
It just didn't pan out.

37:31.953 --> 37:33.320
What about Molly and all
the other girls, then?

37:33.388 --> 37:35.021
I guess it didn't pan out
for them either.

37:35.089 --> 37:36.022
Is that him?

37:36.090 --> 37:38.125
Is that that son of a bitch?

37:38.192 --> 37:39.559
Hey, what the hell
is he doing here?

37:39.627 --> 37:40.827
I called him.
Yeah, I thought

37:40.895 --> 37:42.362
that's the least I could do.

37:42.430 --> 37:43.797
Yeah, that's him.

37:47.568 --> 37:50.570
I've always been proud of the fact
I never resorted to violence,

37:50.638 --> 37:53.039
you worthless piece of trash.

37:53.107 --> 37:56.410
I'll forget your face, but
you'll never forget mine.

38:01.949 --> 38:04.718
Hey, hey, come on.

38:05.553 --> 38:07.687
Come on, let's go.

38:19.133 --> 38:22.035
So, Amy left some toys out,

38:22.103 --> 38:24.137
my mom tripped on them
and fell,

38:24.205 --> 38:25.906
and that's what killed her?

38:25.973 --> 38:27.808
Yeah. He was covering up
for her.

38:27.875 --> 38:31.545
He didn't want her to have
to live with the guilt.

38:46.828 --> 38:48.795
Molly.

38:52.567 --> 38:55.168
Amy just found out
what really happened.

38:55.236 --> 38:57.537
You told her?

38:57.605 --> 38:59.105
No, I did.

39:03.778 --> 39:05.679
I loved your mom.

39:05.746 --> 39:07.581
But if you were protecting Amy,

39:07.648 --> 39:09.549
why wouldn't you tell me?

39:10.384 --> 39:11.852
Molly.

39:11.919 --> 39:17.357
Just...Try to be your dad
for a second, all right?

39:24.866 --> 39:28.201
You were protecting me, too?

39:30.371 --> 39:32.806
He's had a hell of a day.

39:35.776 --> 39:36.943
He needs you.

39:39.347 --> 39:42.315
That's the understatement
of the century.

39:56.764 --> 39:59.399
I'm sorry.

40:11.001 --> 40:13.535
You got the job, didn't you?

40:15.371 --> 40:18.940
I can't say I'm not completely
and incredibly surprised.

40:19.008 --> 40:21.243
Well, you deserve it.

40:21.311 --> 40:23.178
The raise, the assistant,

40:23.246 --> 40:26.381
the inevitable
superiority complex.

40:26.449 --> 40:28.984
Yeah. About that...

40:29.051 --> 40:32.019
wait, you didn't
turn it down, did you?

40:32.087 --> 40:34.355
Loker?

40:35.890 --> 40:37.425
I took the job.

40:37.493 --> 40:39.793
Right.

40:39.861 --> 40:41.895
But technically,
the superiority complex

40:41.963 --> 40:45.665
and the job don't start
until tomorrow.

40:45.733 --> 40:49.102
So I was thinking that
we could get a drink...

40:49.170 --> 40:52.172
And celebrate.

40:55.109 --> 40:57.910
I wish I could, boss.

41:00.214 --> 41:05.917
* You said the moon *

41:05.985 --> 41:09.488
* was ours *

41:09.556 --> 41:11.157
* yeah *

41:11.224 --> 41:13.692
* you said the moon was ours *

41:13.760 --> 41:15.694
* to hell with the day *

41:15.762 --> 41:17.029
What are you doing?

41:17.096 --> 41:18.929
Finishing my journalism essay.

41:18.997 --> 41:20.431
All right.

41:20.499 --> 41:21.699
How's it going?

41:21.767 --> 41:24.536
I just have one last question.

41:24.603 --> 41:30.575
You're worried about the lie
Amy has to tell, aren't you?

41:32.344 --> 41:34.344
Confidentially?

41:39.417 --> 41:41.351
All right,
in my experience, right,

41:41.419 --> 41:43.520
telling a lie

41:43.588 --> 41:46.690
can never be a good thing.

41:46.757 --> 41:50.293
Even if it'll save a family
and a life?

41:53.897 --> 41:55.464
I hope I got
this one right, em.

41:55.532 --> 41:57.233
I really do.

41:57.301 --> 42:00.969
Would you ever lie
to protect me?

42:01.037 --> 42:03.038
You'd never put me
in that position.

42:03.106 --> 42:06.241
That's a deflection, and a
little naive, by the way.

42:06.309 --> 42:08.810
You see, you've been
spending far too much time

42:08.877 --> 42:10.345
hanging around in my office.

42:10.413 --> 42:12.447
Just answer the question,
please.

42:13.982 --> 42:19.187
I'd lie my ass off
to protect you.

42:20.189 --> 42:21.955
Me, too.

42:27.895 --> 42:30.264
Just do your homework.

42:36.971 --> 42:38.104
Uh-oh.

42:40.073 --> 42:42.174
What are you going
to tell the teacher?

42:42.243 --> 42:43.676
The dog ate it.

42:43.744 --> 42:45.678
Right.

42:45.746 --> 42:46.846
Em.

42:46.913 --> 42:48.481
Hmm?

42:48.549 --> 42:49.782
Come here.

42:49.850 --> 42:52.084
We haven't got a dog.

42:52.152 --> 42:55.621
Well, I guess
we'll have to get one.
