12:50.060 --> 12:50.978
- GUYS, I'VE GOT IT!

12:55.107 --> 12:58.527
[laughs]

12:58.611 --> 13:00.654
- THREE REFLECTORS
OUT OF SIX.

13:00.738 --> 13:04.366
- CAREFUL.
EASY DOES IT.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.368
- YEAH, 'CAUSE WE WOULDN'T
WANT TO BREAK IT,

13:06.452 --> 13:08.871
WHAT WITH IT BEING
SO VERY, VERY PRETTY.

13:14.835 --> 13:15.753
- WE GOT IT.

13:15.836 --> 13:17.004
- CAN WE GO NOW?

13:17.087 --> 13:18.797
IT'S LIKE BEING SURROUNDED
BY HOMEWORK.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.093
- OH, NINA, CAN YOU TAKE IT?

13:23.177 --> 13:24.637
- YEAH.

13:34.438 --> 13:37.775
WHAT IS IT?

13:37.858 --> 13:42.238
- [stammers]

13:42.321 --> 13:44.198
- FABIAN?

13:44.281 --> 13:46.617
ARE YOU OKAY?

13:46.700 --> 13:50.913
- IT'S JASPER'S USHABTI--

13:50.996 --> 13:56.085
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
HALFWAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.003
DO YOU THINK JASPER LIED TO ME?

14:06.387 --> 14:08.764
- [gasps]
HEY!

14:08.847 --> 14:11.600
- WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?
WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?

14:11.684 --> 14:12.977
[camera shutter clicks]

14:13.060 --> 14:13.936
- WHAT WAS THAT?

14:14.019 --> 14:14.395
- I DON'T KNOW.

14:14.478 --> 14:16.313
HERE.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.486
- WHAT IS IT?

14:22.570 --> 14:23.696
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

14:23.779 --> 14:24.446
- A CELLAR.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.449
- THAT'S IT.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.660
I SAW SOMETHING--

14:29.743 --> 14:31.287
SOMETHING--

14:31.370 --> 14:34.915
- SOMETHING PALE, NOCTURNAL,
AND LIKES TO WALK THROUGH WALLS?

14:34.999 --> 14:38.127
- YEAH.
WHAT IS IT?

14:38.210 --> 14:41.213
- I THINK WE JUST FOUND
OUR SPOOK.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.591
- BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS.

14:43.674 --> 14:44.592
- [chuckles]

14:44.675 --> 14:46.051
YEAH, YOU MADE THAT
PERFECTLY CLEAR

14:46.135 --> 14:47.303
THE WAY YOU JUST SCREAMED
AND HID.

14:47.386 --> 14:48.887
[chuckles]

14:48.971 --> 14:50.180
HEY, CHEER UP.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.307
WE'VE ONLY GOT ANOTHER
FIVE HOURS IN HERE

14:51.390 --> 14:54.727
UNTIL VICTOR DOES
HIS MORNING ROUNDS.

14:54.810 --> 14:56.103
- [shudders]

14:59.690 --> 15:03.193
[footsteps]

15:03.277 --> 15:06.071
- [whistling]

15:26.300 --> 15:27.718
- [yawns]

15:36.602 --> 15:38.646
[sighs]

15:46.612 --> 15:48.030
AMBER?

15:48.113 --> 15:51.617
- HEY, BRING AWAY
THE ARTIFICIAL LIGHT BULB.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.702
- AMBER, DO YOU NOTICE
ANYTHING DIFFERENT?

15:53.786 --> 15:56.789
- OH, I ALWAYS GET THIS WRONG.

15:56.872 --> 15:58.540
DID YOU STRAIGHTEN YOUR HAIR?

15:58.624 --> 16:01.669
- NO, LOOK!

16:01.752 --> 16:03.087
- NINA, THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.713
- EXACTLY!

16:08.634 --> 16:10.761
- THE DOLLHOUSE IS GONE.

16:10.844 --> 16:12.179
both: WHAT?

16:12.262 --> 16:14.598
- IT'S MY FAULT FOR LEAVING
THE WARDROBE UNLOCKED.

16:14.682 --> 16:17.643
- DON'T BLAME YOURSELF.
I RUSHED YOU.

16:17.726 --> 16:18.769
- OKAY.

16:18.852 --> 16:20.062
- WHAT, IT'S GONE
AS IN STOLEN GONE?

16:20.145 --> 16:22.648
- DO YOU THINK VICTOR
HAS SOMETHING TO DO--

16:22.731 --> 16:24.108
- VERA, SHE'S EVIL,
REMEMBER?

16:24.191 --> 16:26.443
PROBABLY SNUCK IN
WHILE WE WERE SLEEPING

16:26.527 --> 16:27.945
LIKE SOME SORT OF NINJA.

16:28.028 --> 16:29.571
- BREAKFAST IS READY.
- [gasps]

16:37.830 --> 16:40.416
- THAT'S NOT THE ONLY DISASTER
FROM LAST NIGHT.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.876
DON'T FORGET EDDIE AND MARA
SNAPPING THAT PHOTO

16:42.960 --> 16:44.253
OF THE GHOST OF AMBER.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.588
- OH, I'M SURE THEY HAVEN'T
GOT ANYTHING,

16:46.672 --> 16:49.591
OTHERWISE WE WOULD HAVE
HEARD ABOUT IT.

16:49.675 --> 16:50.426
- CHECK IT OUT.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.761
PROOF OF THE GHOST OF ANUBIS.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.555
- CAN I SEE?
- YEAH.

16:54.638 --> 16:55.931
- I THINK WE HAVE
ENOUGH EVIDENCE NOW

16:56.014 --> 16:57.307
TO GO WITH THE STORY.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.351
- YEAH, YEAH, PEOPLE EAT UP
THIS KIND OF BOLOGNA.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.271
- IT'S NOT BOLOGNA.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.397
I MEAN, THE ARTICLE WILL PRESENT

17:04.481 --> 17:06.358
BOTH THE BELIEVER
AND THE SKEPTIC'S POINT OF VIEW.

17:06.442 --> 17:11.613
- OKAY, BUT JUST NOT TOO MUCH
OF THE SKEPTIC'S VIEW.

17:11.696 --> 17:14.782
IT KIND OF JUST MAKES IT SEEM
A BIT "MEH," YOU KNOW?

17:14.867 --> 17:17.286
I WANT PEOPLE TO BELIEVE THIS.

17:17.368 --> 17:18.787
GIVE ME AN ANGLE.

17:18.871 --> 17:19.829
- DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS?

17:19.913 --> 17:21.999
- YES.
STORIES NEED ANGLE.

17:22.082 --> 17:23.834
I NEED AN ANGLE,
SO GIVE ME AN ANGLE,

17:23.916 --> 17:28.464
AND THEN I PUT IT OUT THERE.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.466
- AN ANGLE.

17:30.549 --> 17:31.133
AN ANGLE.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.640
- THEY ARE REALLY GETTING
ON MY NERVES NOW.

17:38.724 --> 17:39.475
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT THEM?

17:39.558 --> 17:41.602
- I KNOW.

17:41.685 --> 17:43.020
IF JOY PUBLISHES,
IT'S GONNA BRING

17:43.103 --> 17:44.480
A WORLD OF ATTENTION
TO WHAT WE'RE DOING.

17:44.563 --> 17:47.316
- NOT THEM, MARA AND EDDIE...

17:47.399 --> 17:48.442
AND THE ARTICLE, OF COURSE.

17:48.525 --> 17:52.946
- WORRY NOT.
AMBER AND I HAVE A CUNNING PLAN.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.281
- REALLY?

17:54.364 --> 17:55.157
- YEAH.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.366
THEY DON'T HAVE AN ARTICLE

17:56.450 --> 17:58.285
IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE PICTURES,
DO THEY?

17:58.368 --> 18:00.120
- SO WE'RE GONNA DESTROY THEM.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.413
- OOH, I LIKE IT.
BRING THEM DOWN.

18:01.497 --> 18:04.500
AND CAN YOU BREAK THEM UP
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT?

18:04.583 --> 18:06.001
- NO, THE PICTURES.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.336
WE'RE GONNA PUT A VIRUS
ON EDDIE'S COMPUTER.

18:07.419 --> 18:12.382
- WE'RE CALLING IT
"OPERATION QUICK SERVER."

18:12.466 --> 18:14.676
- WHY?
- BECAUSE IT SOUNDS COOL.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.136
- WELL, YOU BETTER BE QUICK

18:16.220 --> 18:17.304
BEFORE THEY COME UP
WITH AN ANGLE.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.941
[phone beeps]

18:29.024 --> 18:30.692
- YES?

18:30.776 --> 18:32.361
- I'VE GOT WHAT YOU WANT.
- EXCELLENT.

18:32.444 --> 18:36.281
YOU'RE PROVING YOURSELF USEFUL
AFTER ALL, JASPER.

18:36.365 --> 18:36.949
BRING IT TO THE HEATH AT 4:00.

18:37.032 --> 18:39.451
- BE WAITING WITH TRUDY.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.329
- EXCUSE ME?

18:42.412 --> 18:45.833
- I'M NOT BRINGING IT
UNLESS YOU BRING HER.

18:45.916 --> 18:48.210
THAT'S FINAL.

18:48.293 --> 18:50.045
NO TRUDY, NO DOLLHOUSE.

18:50.128 --> 18:52.089
- THAT'S NOT--

18:52.172 --> 18:53.882
- [breathes heavily]

18:53.966 --> 18:55.217
[phone rings]

18:55.300 --> 18:58.428
[sighs]

18:58.512 --> 18:59.555
YES?

18:59.638 --> 19:01.723
- DO NOT HANG UP ON ME AGAIN.

19:01.807 --> 19:04.226
I WILL GIVE YOU TRUDY,
BUT YOU PULL ANY MORE SURPRISES,

19:04.309 --> 19:09.273
AND YOU'LL PAY FOR IT
WITH HER LIFE.

19:09.356 --> 19:10.357
- [breathes heavily]

19:13.151 --> 19:17.447
HOW MUCH OF THAT
DID YOU HEAR?

19:17.531 --> 19:21.493
- ENOUGH TO KNOW
YOU CAN'T DO THIS ON YOUR OWN.

19:21.994 --> 19:25.080
- [sighs]

19:25.163 --> 19:29.209
- ANGLE.
WHO DOES SHE THINK SHE IS?

19:29.293 --> 19:31.628
- UH, THE EDITOR?

19:31.712 --> 19:33.589
- I WAS BEING RHETORICAL.

19:33.672 --> 19:34.882
- OKAY, COME HERE.

19:34.965 --> 19:36.091
THIS IS THE STILL
OF THE BID FOOTAGE, OKAY?

19:36.174 --> 19:40.304
- MM-HMM.
- AND HERE'S THE GHOST.

19:40.387 --> 19:40.929
- YEAH, SO?

19:41.013 --> 19:42.681
WE'VE BEEN HERE.

19:42.764 --> 19:43.932
- AH, NO, WE HAVEN'T BEEN HERE.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.394
I RES-ED IT OUT.
HERE, TAKE A LOOK.

19:47.477 --> 19:48.437
[computer beeps]

19:48.520 --> 19:51.356
THERE.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.608
- WHAT IS THAT?

19:52.691 --> 19:56.278
- DO I HAVE TO DO ALL THE WORK?

19:56.361 --> 19:59.531
- I SUPPOSE IT LOOKS
A BIT LIKE A--

19:59.615 --> 20:01.658
- UH-HUH?

20:01.742 --> 20:02.659
A BIT LIKE A--

20:02.743 --> 20:04.244
- HEY, EDDIE.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.163
CAN I BORROW YOUR LAPPY?
I NEED TO CHECK MY PROFILE.

20:06.246 --> 20:08.624
- YEAH.

20:08.707 --> 20:11.209
CAN'T YOU JUST
USE THE MIRROR, THOUGH?

20:11.293 --> 20:13.337
- I'M BRITISH.
I DON'T GET YOUR JOKES, EDDIE.

20:19.885 --> 20:20.552
- YOU FORGOT YOUR PASSWORD?

20:20.636 --> 20:24.014
- UH, IT'S PRIVATE.

20:24.097 --> 20:25.098
- RIGHT.

20:29.144 --> 20:30.646
OKAY, I'M GONNA
NEED IT BACK NOW BECAUSE--

20:30.729 --> 20:36.151
- UH, STATUS.
YOU CAN'T RUSH A STATUS UPDATE.

20:36.234 --> 20:39.571
JUST ONE TYPO
CAN CAUSE MAJOR FALLOUT.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.240
- RIGHT.

20:45.869 --> 20:48.205
- COME ON, AMBER.

20:50.874 --> 20:53.043
[computer chimes]

20:53.126 --> 20:54.252
- DONE.
THANKS, EDDIE.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.338
- YEAH, SURE.

20:56.421 --> 20:57.130
- YES!
OH!

20:57.214 --> 21:00.425
- I KNEW IT.
LOOK.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.886
- THE CROWN
OF THE UNKNOWN RULER?

21:02.970 --> 21:05.889
"GHOST HAUNTS LOCAL EXHIBITION!"

21:05.973 --> 21:07.516
- THERE'S OUR ANGLE.

21:07.599 --> 21:10.102
- YES!

21:17.150 --> 21:18.986
- I CAN'T SEE TRUDY.

21:35.419 --> 21:36.962
TRUDY!
WHERE'S TRUDY?

21:46.763 --> 21:48.807
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHERE'S TRUDY?

21:48.890 --> 21:51.184
YOU PROMISED!
WE HAD A DEAL!

21:51.268 --> 21:52.811
- WE HAD NO DEAL.

21:52.894 --> 21:54.563
YOU CAME UP WITH THOSE TERMS.
I DID NOT.

21:54.646 --> 21:58.984
YOU NEED REMINDING
ABOUT WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.527
- [yells]

22:04.239 --> 22:06.992
- NO.
IT CAN'T BE!
