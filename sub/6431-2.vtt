Adwin Kosan,

00:04.148 --> 00:05.615
Agent Lattimer,
Agent Bering.

00:05.683 --> 00:07.350
- You make the decisions.
- Yes.

00:07.418 --> 00:09.486
"It breaks my heart
to write this.

00:09.553 --> 00:12.858
"We both know the warehouse
is my happiest place.

00:12.926 --> 00:14.510
Please forgive me,
but I have to go."

00:19.697 --> 00:21.899
Agent, Steve Jinks.

00:21.967 --> 00:23.702
I'm really looking forward
to working with you.

00:23.770 --> 00:25.306
You're lying.

00:26.715 --> 00:27.981
We need your help.
You were almost killed

00:28.049 --> 00:29.283
by an artifact.

00:29.351 --> 00:31.992
You are now officially
a warehouse agent.

00:34.529 --> 00:35.462
Hey.

00:36.931 --> 00:38.931
Welcome back.
Thanks.

00:45.839 --> 00:47.372
And the first guy goes,

00:47.440 --> 00:48.840
"I don't have
to outrun the bear.

00:48.908 --> 00:50.242
I just have
to outrun you."

00:52.211 --> 00:54.245
Yeah, you told me that one
on the eastbound flight.

00:54.313 --> 00:56.414
No, I didn't.

00:56.482 --> 00:58.652
All right,
beginning our descent.

01:08.498 --> 01:09.999
Ugh.

01:21.813 --> 01:23.047
What the hell?

01:23.115 --> 01:24.884
Adam, are you
all right?

01:24.952 --> 01:26.486
What's this?

01:26.554 --> 01:28.054
- Adam!
- How did I get here?

01:28.122 --> 01:29.122
What's happening
to me?

01:30.625 --> 01:31.626
I don't know
how to do this.

01:31.694 --> 01:33.061
Island Flight 687,

01:33.129 --> 01:34.729
entering nose-down
pitch attitude.

01:34.797 --> 01:36.064
What am I doing here?

01:36.132 --> 01:38.033
Approach
is no longer stabilized.

01:38.101 --> 01:40.671
Island Flight 687.
Declaring an emergency.

01:40.739 --> 01:44.009
Island Flight 687,
what's your situation?

01:44.076 --> 01:46.144
The world
is such a scary place.

01:48.549 --> 01:51.250
The most innocent objects
can cause destruction.

01:51.318 --> 01:53.186
And mayhem.

01:53.254 --> 01:54.821
A person
sees enough of that,

01:54.889 --> 01:56.757
and maybe they decide
they don't want

01:56.824 --> 01:59.559
that much
responsibility anymore.

01:59.627 --> 02:02.329
A person might think,
walking away--

02:02.397 --> 02:04.098
okay, not "a person."

02:04.165 --> 02:05.466
Me.

02:05.533 --> 02:07.100
I left.

02:07.168 --> 02:10.270
"Life or death" all the time,
it was too much.

02:10.336 --> 02:12.839
But as a wise
and also psychotic woman

02:12.906 --> 02:14.340
recently told me,

02:14.408 --> 02:15.975
you can't walk away

02:16.042 --> 02:17.243
from your truth.

02:17.310 --> 02:19.212
So I'm back.

02:19.280 --> 02:21.148
Am I ready?

02:21.216 --> 02:23.884
The "life or death" thing,
it never goes away.

02:23.952 --> 02:26.820
The world
is a scary place.

02:26.888 --> 02:29.523
First day back.

02:29.591 --> 02:31.526
I guess we'll see.

Concentrate on

02:52.282 --> 02:56.085
And...there's
no chair for me.

02:57.855 --> 02:59.889
Don't freak out.
It's just a chair.

02:59.957 --> 03:01.324
It doesn't mean
that they've moved on,

03:01.392 --> 03:03.359
or they don't need me, or...

03:05.429 --> 03:06.562
Here ya go, Myka.

03:08.432 --> 03:10.199
Oh, thanks.
A chair, right. Yeah.

03:10.267 --> 03:11.600
Oh, Myka! Thank goddess.

03:11.668 --> 03:12.868
Leena and I
were being outnumbered

03:12.936 --> 03:14.303
by team sausage fest.

03:14.371 --> 03:17.273
- Oh!
- Oh, that's disgusting.

03:17.341 --> 03:18.874
What? You all eat crap
for breakfast.

03:18.942 --> 03:20.343
It's nice to finally have

03:20.411 --> 03:21.812
a healthy eater
back in the group.

03:21.879 --> 03:23.313
Could we just try
five minutes <i>on,</i> please?

03:23.381 --> 03:24.481
Yes.

03:24.549 --> 03:27.284
Uh, Adam Ashby.

03:27.352 --> 03:29.353
Airline pilot

03:29.421 --> 03:31.355
who forgot how
to fly his plane yesterday

03:31.423 --> 03:33.959
while several thousand feet
over Seattle.

03:34.027 --> 03:36.161
Luckily his first officer
stepped in.

03:36.229 --> 03:38.531
Now, it could've been
just a neurological event,

03:38.598 --> 03:41.334
but I don't think
it was a transitory...

03:41.402 --> 03:43.336
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:43.404 --> 03:46.073
Artie, are we gonna fly,
or are we gonna drive?

03:46.141 --> 03:48.175
'Cause this is mm-mm...

03:48.243 --> 03:49.577
Hmm?

03:49.645 --> 03:51.379
Can you tell him?

03:51.447 --> 03:53.782
He wants to know if we
can go to Seattle by train,

03:53.850 --> 03:55.383
because planes
are scary to him now.

03:55.451 --> 03:56.985
You still speak Pete?

03:57.053 --> 03:58.654
Recovered, never cured.

03:58.721 --> 03:59.888
You're gonna
take a plane.

03:59.956 --> 04:01.223
You're gonna
be perfectly safe.

04:01.291 --> 04:05.160
You two go pack,
and you two come with me.

04:06.697 --> 04:08.130
Hey. I was, uh--

04:08.198 --> 04:09.532
should we...

04:09.600 --> 04:12.401
Talk, you know,
about me leaving?

04:12.469 --> 04:14.436
Because if there's something
that you have to say to me,

04:14.504 --> 04:15.704
you can say it.

04:15.772 --> 04:17.039
No matter what it is,
I can take it.

04:17.107 --> 04:19.908
Mykes, we're
double-rainbow all the way.

04:19.976 --> 04:21.375
And...

04:21.444 --> 04:23.345
We're back on the case.

04:31.018 --> 04:34.521
- You're going to Boston.
- These are case folders.

04:34.589 --> 04:35.889
Thank you.

04:35.957 --> 04:38.359
The auction house
offering today,

04:38.426 --> 04:40.160
as one of its items,

04:40.228 --> 04:42.897
a butcher knife
owned by one Mary Mallon...

04:42.965 --> 04:44.632
- Typhoid Mary.
- Who--

04:44.700 --> 04:46.468
Excellent.

04:46.535 --> 04:47.569
Kiss-ass.

04:47.637 --> 04:49.104
You're a child.

04:49.172 --> 04:52.141
The knife lets its owner
transfer its disease

04:52.209 --> 04:53.943
or his injury to anyone.

04:54.011 --> 04:55.444
And your assignment--

04:55.512 --> 04:57.313
go, bid, win.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.183
Go!

05:01.251 --> 05:03.152
"Your"? Not "our"?

05:03.219 --> 05:04.419
No, I'm gonna be
in New Hampshire.

05:04.487 --> 05:05.787
Memorial service
for a regent.

05:05.855 --> 05:08.156
She was killed
in a boating accident.

05:08.224 --> 05:09.457
Awesome.

05:09.525 --> 05:10.625
I mean, not--
not for her, obviously.

05:10.693 --> 05:11.760
Very sad.

05:11.827 --> 05:14.062
But I get my own mission?
Yes.

05:14.130 --> 05:16.164
Take the new guy.

05:16.232 --> 05:17.465
Uh-huh.

05:17.533 --> 05:20.035
And who's
the senior agent?

05:20.102 --> 05:21.536
That'd be me.

05:21.604 --> 05:24.272
♪ Me, me,
me, me, me, me... ♪

05:24.340 --> 05:25.907
Uh, this doesn't make
any sense.

05:25.975 --> 05:27.642
Oh, it does
when you know her better.

05:27.710 --> 05:30.145
No, no, no. Last week
it was all invisible snakes,

05:30.212 --> 05:32.180
phantom knives,
slam, bam, death by Shakespeare.

05:32.248 --> 05:34.750
Today you're
sending me on a--

05:34.817 --> 05:36.285
a Fedex run
for a cooking implement.

05:36.352 --> 05:38.553
I mean, isn't there
something more...

05:38.621 --> 05:40.088
Not boring?

05:40.156 --> 05:43.125
I'm gonna need you to keep
that attitude in check, Jinksy,

05:43.192 --> 05:45.360
as the senior agent
on this mission.

05:45.428 --> 05:46.595
Oh, I'm so sorry.

05:46.662 --> 05:48.296
Please continue
your "Me dance."

05:50.599 --> 05:51.666
Artie.

05:51.733 --> 05:52.700
Come back
with the artifact

05:52.768 --> 05:53.968
and then tell me
it's too easy.

05:54.036 --> 05:56.004
Ugh.

06:04.014 --> 06:05.915
We've never seen a case
quite like this.

06:05.983 --> 06:08.785
Two days ago, this man
was an experienced pilot

06:08.852 --> 06:11.354
with a degree
in Aeronautical Engineering.

06:11.422 --> 06:12.489
The chart says
he's gotten worse

06:12.556 --> 06:13.891
since he came in.

06:13.958 --> 06:16.226
Yeah. Yesterday he thought
he was in college.

06:16.294 --> 06:18.428
Today he's five years old.

06:18.496 --> 06:21.063
We think it's some sort
of accelerated Alzheimer's.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.066
And no one else
he's come in contact with

06:23.133 --> 06:24.901
has been affected?
No.

06:24.968 --> 06:26.336
And physically he's fine,

06:26.403 --> 06:28.972
but his mind,
his memory is just--

06:29.039 --> 06:31.107
He's slipping away.

06:36.346 --> 06:37.547
All right, kids,

06:37.614 --> 06:38.514
this is where
it gets interesting.

06:38.582 --> 06:39.582
Hemostat.

06:54.833 --> 06:56.667
Wh-what's going on?

06:56.734 --> 06:58.301
Where--what do I--

07:00.138 --> 07:01.905
Where am I?
Put your mask back on.

07:01.973 --> 07:04.474
- Oh, my God. I had this--
- Doctor. Doctor, you need to...

07:04.542 --> 07:06.209
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- Pressure's dropping.

07:06.277 --> 07:07.945
He's going into shock.
Code blue!

07:08.012 --> 07:10.447
We need help!
Call for help now!

07:10.515 --> 07:12.516
We need
to stabilize him.

07:19.650 --> 07:21.618
And 300 to you, sir.
Looking for 400.

07:21.685 --> 07:23.786
400 anywhere in the room?
Looking for 400.

07:23.854 --> 07:26.188
400. Looking for 400.
400 I have...

07:26.256 --> 07:27.256
Okay,
Mary's knife is next.

07:27.323 --> 07:28.957
This is very Thomas Crown.

07:29.025 --> 07:30.325
Well, it's not a Monet.

07:30.393 --> 07:31.960
It's a kitchen utensil.

07:33.963 --> 07:35.664
So you're kind of
a poopy-pants, aren't you?

07:35.732 --> 07:36.965
No, it's just
that I thought that this job

07:37.033 --> 07:38.200
was gonna have
a little more action,

07:38.268 --> 07:39.535
like what I'm used to
at the ATF--

07:39.603 --> 07:41.871
guns and bad guys...
Guns.

07:41.939 --> 07:44.107
Right. Well, we don't
go after bad guys in our job.

07:44.175 --> 07:45.675
We go after artifacts.

07:45.743 --> 07:47.177
So if you wanna kill
a bad guy,

07:47.245 --> 07:49.481
maybe find the person
who made this ceramic clown.

07:49.548 --> 07:51.249
Ew! Ohh!
Take it away. Please.

07:51.317 --> 07:53.684
Next up
is item number 62--

07:53.752 --> 07:56.387
Mary Mallon's knife.
Ooh, ooh! Here we go.

07:56.455 --> 07:58.189
We'll begin the bidding
at $2,000.

07:58.257 --> 07:59.658
2,000?
Thank you very much.

07:59.725 --> 08:01.859
2,000 I have.
Looking for 2,100.

08:01.927 --> 08:04.462
Thank you. 2,100.
2,200 anywhere?

08:04.529 --> 08:06.731
- She's going after my knife.
- Do you not understand

08:06.798 --> 08:07.899
how an auction works?

08:07.966 --> 08:09.300
Looking for 2,300.
2,300 to you.

08:09.368 --> 08:11.402
Thank you very much.
2,400 anywhere in the room?

08:11.470 --> 08:12.904
2,400.
My budget isn't unlimited,

08:12.972 --> 08:14.940
Nanny McSnootyson.
I hate her.

08:15.007 --> 08:16.842
This is silly.
Why didn't we just buy it

08:16.910 --> 08:18.344
before it went to auction?

08:18.412 --> 08:21.013
Because we're stealth, dude.
We try not to get noticed.

08:21.081 --> 08:22.482
And aren't you a Buddhist
or something?

08:22.549 --> 08:24.084
Try being one with the Universe
for like a minute.

08:24.151 --> 08:25.652
I am Zen.
I am way Zen.

08:25.720 --> 08:28.255
I can meditate
for like two hours.

08:28.322 --> 08:29.456
Which, by the way,

08:29.524 --> 08:31.258
would be more exciting
than this.

08:31.326 --> 08:33.092
2,800. Looking for 2,900
anywhere in the room.

08:33.160 --> 08:34.494
2,900 may I say?

08:34.562 --> 08:37.429
2,800 once, twice,

08:37.498 --> 08:39.365
fair warning.

08:40.768 --> 08:42.902
Sold to bidder number 14
for $2,800.

08:42.970 --> 08:43.870
Yes!

08:47.674 --> 08:50.776
I mean bravo.
Yes. Hear, hear.

08:50.844 --> 08:53.879
We can go home now,
poopy-pants.

08:53.947 --> 08:56.316
You've got a new nickname.

08:56.383 --> 08:58.819
I like "Jinksy."

08:58.886 --> 09:01.788
Stolen?
What do you mean stolen?

09:01.856 --> 09:04.458
It must've happened
before the auction this morning.

09:04.525 --> 09:05.893
In all my years
of holding a gavel,

09:05.960 --> 09:07.061
this has never occurred.

09:07.128 --> 09:08.395
I'm completely mortified.

09:08.463 --> 09:10.832
We'll be back.

09:10.899 --> 09:12.400
He's mortified?
My first real case,

09:12.468 --> 09:13.734
and the artifact
gets stolen.

09:13.802 --> 09:15.236
First time on my own--
no offense.

09:15.303 --> 09:17.271
- Now we have a bad guy.
- Yeah, great.

09:17.339 --> 09:18.572
And it's our fault
there's somebody out there

09:18.640 --> 09:21.041
with the power
to make anyone sick.

09:21.108 --> 09:23.042
We appreciate
you giving us a call.

09:23.110 --> 09:24.277
Well,
when it happened again,

09:24.344 --> 09:25.545
I thought you guys
would be interested.

09:25.612 --> 09:28.481
Dr. Lisa Ward.
She's a surgeon here.

09:28.549 --> 09:30.249
Middle of a quad bypass,

09:30.317 --> 09:31.784
and forgot how to perform
the surgery.

09:31.852 --> 09:33.919
Chief had to scrub in.

09:37.190 --> 09:39.125
Oh, my God.
Who are you guys?

09:39.192 --> 09:42.894
Call my mom, okay?
I want to go home <i>now.</i>

09:42.962 --> 09:44.896
Same symptoms
as the pilot?

09:44.964 --> 09:47.899
Not as far regressed yet.

09:47.967 --> 09:49.834
Two victims unrelated.

09:49.902 --> 09:51.336
I mean, they didn't
know each other.

09:51.404 --> 09:52.805
Different jobs,
different neighborhoods,

09:52.872 --> 09:55.174
different everything.
There has to be a connection.

09:55.241 --> 09:56.742
Well, maybe
the artifact is airborne

09:56.810 --> 09:58.077
or in the water.

09:58.145 --> 09:59.612
Then why just these two?

09:59.680 --> 10:01.615
I mean, why aren't
more people being affected?

10:01.682 --> 10:03.250
Okay, I'll follow
the paper trail,

10:03.318 --> 10:04.618
see if their lives
meet anywhere.

10:04.686 --> 10:06.487
Okay.
I'll talk to Leena

10:06.554 --> 10:08.923
and see what we can dig up
about memory loss artifacts.

10:10.559 --> 10:11.926
Okay.

10:13.795 --> 10:15.696
What?
Wh-what is it?

10:15.764 --> 10:17.631
No, nothing. I--

10:17.699 --> 10:19.899
Uh, I--nothing.

10:19.967 --> 10:23.036
I spaced out. Never mind.
I'll see ya later.

10:30.610 --> 10:32.144
Hey, Mr. Mortified,

10:32.212 --> 10:34.013
we spoke to the woman
who bid against me.

10:34.081 --> 10:35.782
She didn't steal it.

10:35.849 --> 10:38.718
Are you sure?
Maybe she was lying.

10:38.786 --> 10:40.320
She wasn't.

10:40.388 --> 10:41.789
Yeah. So we're gonna need
to see timecards

10:41.856 --> 10:43.290
for any employees
who had access

10:43.358 --> 10:44.925
to the collection room
this morning.

10:44.993 --> 10:46.494
Certainly.
But I can't imagine

10:46.562 --> 10:49.331
it was any of my people.

10:54.037 --> 10:55.470
Hello.

10:55.538 --> 10:57.639
The janitor went home early.
He was sick this morning.

10:58.808 --> 11:00.776
Owen Larsen.

11:00.844 --> 11:02.945
But he wasn't sick.
He quit.

11:03.013 --> 11:04.614
It says here that he's only
worked for you for a week?

11:04.681 --> 11:06.115
Well, he's
an older gentleman.

11:06.183 --> 11:08.117
He said the work
was too much for him.

11:08.185 --> 11:11.053
Really? Coincidence
the name is Larsen?

11:11.121 --> 11:14.057
- I got the address.
- Let's go.

11:24.202 --> 11:25.569
Nothing so far,

11:25.637 --> 11:27.805
well, not with those particular
memory loss symptoms.

11:27.873 --> 11:29.440
That doesn't mean
it's not out there.

11:29.508 --> 11:31.042
Well, we'll take
whatever you can find.

11:32.412 --> 11:34.513
So...how is it...

11:34.581 --> 11:36.081
Being back?

11:36.149 --> 11:38.283
I don't know.
Pete says everything is fine,

11:38.351 --> 11:39.585
so maybe I should just relax.

11:39.652 --> 11:41.654
Why do you ask?

11:41.721 --> 11:44.089
Nothing. No reason.

11:44.157 --> 11:45.824
Leena, did you
pick something up on Pete

11:45.892 --> 11:46.859
aura-wise?

11:46.927 --> 11:48.794
Myka,

11:48.861 --> 11:52.130
anything that I happen to see
in Pete's aura

11:52.198 --> 11:53.398
could just be--
You did.

11:53.466 --> 11:55.100
Okay,
I'm not imagining it.

11:55.167 --> 11:56.668
There <i>is</i> something
bothering him.

11:56.736 --> 11:58.136
Leena, you have
to tell me what it is.

11:58.204 --> 11:59.304
Tell you what?

11:59.371 --> 12:01.305
Did she find something?
Oh!

12:01.373 --> 12:02.740
No!

12:02.808 --> 12:03.975
No, nothing.

12:04.042 --> 12:06.410
It's just...Girl stuff.

12:06.478 --> 12:08.979
- Gross.
- Yeah. What do you got?

12:09.046 --> 12:11.648
No clue, meet clue.

12:11.715 --> 12:13.016
Check out
the credit card statements

12:13.083 --> 12:15.018
for pilot man
and doctor lady.

12:15.086 --> 12:16.586
They ate at
the same restaurant.

12:16.654 --> 12:17.821
That's right.
Jalapeno Harry's.

12:17.888 --> 12:19.790
Same night. April 6th,
the night a waitress

12:19.857 --> 12:21.758
named Amy
was murdered there.

12:23.527 --> 12:25.094
Feel free to applaud
my brilliance.

12:25.162 --> 12:26.496
Yeah, maybe later.

12:26.564 --> 12:28.932
Well, I'm gonna drop in
and see what I can see.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.501
Okay, I'm gonna talk
to the victims,

12:30.568 --> 12:31.769
mention the name
of the restaurant.

12:31.836 --> 12:33.671
Maybe it'll jog something loose
in their minds.

12:33.739 --> 12:35.306
- Okay.
- Hey, Pete.

12:35.374 --> 12:36.774
- Yeah?
- Uh...

12:36.842 --> 12:39.343
Before...

12:39.411 --> 12:41.145
You said
everything was fine.

12:41.213 --> 12:43.915
And...yet we're
still talking about it.

12:43.983 --> 12:45.584
I just think...

12:45.651 --> 12:46.751
Even if it's hard,

12:46.819 --> 12:49.355
you can say anything
to me.

12:49.422 --> 12:52.457
Yeah?
Are--are you sure?

12:52.525 --> 12:54.626
Absolutely.
Anything. Anything.

12:55.828 --> 12:57.929
Okay.

12:57.997 --> 13:00.197
Wow, it's--

13:00.265 --> 13:02.032
it's kind of hard.

13:02.100 --> 13:04.001
Uh, you know what?
Fine. I'm just--

13:04.069 --> 13:06.269
I'm just gonna come out
and say it.

13:07.438 --> 13:08.905
Um...

13:10.207 --> 13:12.776
The force will be
with you always.

13:13.978 --> 13:15.112
If you don't--

13:15.180 --> 13:17.181
Also, release the Kraken.

13:17.248 --> 13:19.183
This is Chinatown Jake.
So stay classy, San Diego.

13:19.251 --> 13:21.052
And pink
is my signature color.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.021
- Never mind.
- Let's not forget

13:23.089 --> 13:24.757
I love the smell of napalm
in the morning.

13:24.825 --> 13:26.025
I think we're gonna need
a bigger boat.

13:26.093 --> 13:27.426
Yo, Adrian, I did it.

13:27.494 --> 13:30.029
And say good night
to the bad guy.

13:31.699 --> 13:33.966
Hello?

13:34.034 --> 13:35.434
Hi! Welcome home!

13:35.502 --> 13:37.302
How's about we get you started
with an onion cone?

13:37.370 --> 13:38.637
How many in your party?

13:38.705 --> 13:40.439
Oh, no, thanks,
but I have some questions

13:40.506 --> 13:42.408
about the night
of April 6th.

13:42.475 --> 13:47.112
Um, I'm here
about these two people.

13:47.180 --> 13:48.881
They both ate dinner here
that night.

13:51.017 --> 13:52.350
I was hoping
you might remember them.

13:52.418 --> 13:54.453
Sorry, can't help you.

13:54.520 --> 13:56.855
Hey, how's about
some pretzel fries?

13:56.923 --> 14:00.359
Uh, no.
No, I better not.

14:00.427 --> 14:02.795
Um, anyone else around here
might remember them?

14:02.862 --> 14:05.197
No, okay?

14:05.265 --> 14:08.000
Look, if you're not gonna eat,
you're gonna have to leave.

14:08.068 --> 14:09.702
Uh, Ken...

14:11.338 --> 14:13.205
The thing is...

14:15.976 --> 14:18.044
I think you know more.

14:20.247 --> 14:22.248
Look, I'm sorry.

14:22.316 --> 14:23.516
Okay, the cops
keep coming in here.

14:23.584 --> 14:24.750
It scares the customers.

14:24.818 --> 14:26.252
All right, well,
I'm not a cop,

14:26.320 --> 14:28.321
so you can talk to me.

14:28.388 --> 14:29.789
Now, this thing says

14:29.856 --> 14:32.358
that the victim
was one of your waitresses.

14:32.426 --> 14:35.027
Yeah. Amy.

14:35.095 --> 14:36.696
Great girl.

14:36.764 --> 14:39.098
It was awful.

14:39.166 --> 14:40.800
A couple of the customers
from that night

14:40.868 --> 14:42.001
are being called
as witnesses.

14:44.071 --> 14:47.273
Yeah. Those two.

14:47.340 --> 14:50.576
The cops have arrested
this guy, Geoffery Cedolia.

14:50.644 --> 14:51.744
They have him in custody.

14:51.812 --> 14:53.646
The trial starts next week.

14:53.714 --> 14:55.014
Well, whatever it is,

14:55.082 --> 14:57.116
we'd better
figure this out fast.

14:57.184 --> 14:58.750
Why? What's going on
over there?

14:58.818 --> 15:00.619
The pilot's lost
all his memories.

15:00.687 --> 15:02.220
There's no one there
anymore.

15:02.288 --> 15:04.055
The doctors think
the involuntary systems

15:04.123 --> 15:07.592
will go next--
swallowing, blinking...

15:07.660 --> 15:09.260
He's forgetting
how to breathe, Pete.

15:22.810 --> 15:24.211
If he had just left the knife
in his apartment,

15:24.278 --> 15:26.746
we'd be on our way back by now,
mission accomplished.

15:26.882 --> 15:29.282
Don't worry. The landlady
said he'd be right back.

15:31.919 --> 15:34.154
You know, the key is...

15:34.222 --> 15:36.056
Clearing your head
of all distracting thought.

15:36.124 --> 15:38.459
Focus just on the target.

15:38.527 --> 15:40.495
I've been on stakeouts
before, Mahatma.

15:40.562 --> 15:42.331
Okay, I'm sure you have.

15:42.398 --> 15:44.166
And, you know,
I have mission experience.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.135
Remember, I'm the...
Senior agent.

15:46.203 --> 15:49.005
I remember. Has it been
five minutes already?

15:49.073 --> 15:52.175
Look, I am just now noticing
that you seem

15:52.243 --> 15:54.811
super-focused on
the whole senior agent thing.

15:54.879 --> 15:56.546
Maybe because
I'm the senior agent.

15:56.613 --> 15:58.014
Right.

15:58.082 --> 16:00.817
And since we both already
really, really know that,

16:00.885 --> 16:03.352
maybe you should try to,
you know, just...

16:03.420 --> 16:04.954
Relax.

16:05.021 --> 16:08.057
I mean, it's just
the two of us out here.

16:15.331 --> 16:17.566
Oh.

16:17.634 --> 16:19.168
I get it.

16:19.235 --> 16:20.235
Get what?
What are you getting?

16:20.303 --> 16:22.271
What's...
Happening here.

16:22.338 --> 16:25.641
Um, we're out of town,
alone,

16:25.708 --> 16:28.210
two reasonably attractive
single people.

16:28.278 --> 16:29.845
Oh. Oh, uh--

16:29.913 --> 16:31.314
It's okay. No, it's not
like I'm not flattered.

16:31.381 --> 16:33.683
I am, and, hey,
I felt it too--

16:33.750 --> 16:35.418
that crackling chemistry
between us.

16:35.486 --> 16:37.220
It's just that I really need
to focus on my career right now.

16:37.288 --> 16:38.955
I don't have a ton of bandwidth
for other stuff,

16:39.023 --> 16:41.291
as attractive
as that other stuff may be.

16:41.358 --> 16:43.026
Okay, so maybe
in a year or two,

16:43.094 --> 16:44.961
if you haven't gotten me
out of your system--

16:45.029 --> 16:46.729
Oh, my God.
I'm not hitting on you.

16:46.797 --> 16:48.331
I'm gay.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.934
You're...how now?

16:52.002 --> 16:53.436
Gay.

16:53.504 --> 16:55.038
You know, when two people
of the same sex

16:55.105 --> 16:56.439
find each other--

16:56.507 --> 16:59.242
Oh, but--
no, I know what gay means. I--

16:59.310 --> 17:00.977
Look, I usually--I don't
make a big deal about it.

17:01.044 --> 17:02.478
You didn't.
I--I thought--

17:02.546 --> 17:04.113
you know what I thought.
No, no, no, no.

17:04.181 --> 17:05.615
You know what?
It's my bad. It's my fault.

17:05.682 --> 17:07.782
I should've stopped you.
I was just waiting for you to...

17:07.851 --> 17:09.785
Take a breath.
No, it's cool.

17:09.853 --> 17:12.253
I've actually been, um,
waiting for an opportunity

17:12.321 --> 17:14.222
to feel this completely
mortified with myself,

17:14.290 --> 17:16.023
so it's, uh--

17:16.092 --> 17:17.659
I'm sorry.
Maybe we should just...

17:17.727 --> 17:18.961
- Not talk.
- Stop talk--yeah.

17:19.028 --> 17:20.863
Good--good thought.
Super.

17:20.930 --> 17:22.330
Yes, yes.

17:25.101 --> 17:27.368
I really am innocent.

17:27.436 --> 17:29.071
I know that sounds
like a cliche.

17:29.139 --> 17:30.205
Are you trying
to find out

17:30.273 --> 17:31.707
who's incapacitating
our witnesses?

17:31.775 --> 17:33.875
Yes.
And, Geoffery,

17:33.943 --> 17:36.678
actually, I'm not here about
whether you did it or not.

17:36.746 --> 17:38.347
Why do you guys think
your witnesses

17:38.414 --> 17:39.715
are getting sick?

17:39.782 --> 17:41.183
Sick? Do you
honestly believe that?

17:41.250 --> 17:43.251
Well, I've seen them--

17:43.319 --> 17:44.886
Or is it possible,
Agent Lattimer,

17:44.954 --> 17:46.321
that my witnesses
were scared off

17:46.389 --> 17:48.657
by the prosecution,
the government prosecution?

17:48.724 --> 17:50.392
I wasn't trying to imply--

17:50.460 --> 17:52.728
Maybe you,
also a government employee,

17:52.795 --> 17:54.596
might feel the need
to protect your brethren.

17:54.664 --> 17:57.799
Look, you're a lawyer,
I get it.

17:57.867 --> 17:59.434
But I'm neutral, guys.

17:59.502 --> 18:00.836
I promise.

18:00.903 --> 18:02.471
And I've seen
your witnesses.

18:02.538 --> 18:04.873
They're not well,
and they're not faking.

18:04.941 --> 18:07.209
And I'm sorry
about that.

18:07.277 --> 18:09.478
But you do realize
Geoffery's life

18:09.546 --> 18:11.080
is at stake here,
don't you?

18:11.147 --> 18:12.948
Shouldn't you
be protecting Eric?

18:13.016 --> 18:15.283
- Eric?
- Eric Bell, my best friend.

18:15.351 --> 18:16.417
I drove him home
that night,

18:16.485 --> 18:18.053
so he knows
I left the restaurant.

18:18.121 --> 18:19.621
They're gonna argue Geoffery
drove back to the restaurant

18:19.689 --> 18:21.956
to kill that woman.

18:22.024 --> 18:23.324
Tire tracks match his car.

18:25.093 --> 18:27.394
I went home
and went to bed.

18:27.462 --> 18:29.729
My girlfriend was at home,
but she's pregnant,

18:29.797 --> 18:31.230
so I didn't wanna
wake her.

18:31.298 --> 18:33.666
Right. So she can't confirm
what time you got there.

18:33.734 --> 18:35.134
They're trying the case
in the press.

18:35.202 --> 18:37.904
Victim's mother's on TV
every other night, crying.

18:37.971 --> 18:40.206
This whole thing
has been a nightmare.

18:41.609 --> 18:43.009
Honestly, I just want
that young man

18:43.077 --> 18:46.946
to pay for what he did
to my daughter.

18:47.014 --> 18:50.917
You've been very vocal
about Mr. Cedolia's guilt.

18:50.985 --> 18:53.419
A person who didn't trust
that he would be found guilty

18:53.487 --> 18:55.955
might take matters
into their own hands.

18:56.023 --> 18:59.325
Why don't you come out
and say it?

18:59.393 --> 19:02.494
If you've done anything
to Mr. Cedolia's witnesses,

19:02.562 --> 19:05.230
or if you've done anything
to tamper with this case

19:05.298 --> 19:06.565
before it goes to trial--

19:06.632 --> 19:07.766
I haven't.

19:07.834 --> 19:10.902
That would be vengeance,
not justice.

19:10.970 --> 19:12.304
He'll be found guilty.

19:12.371 --> 19:14.506
I know it.
I have faith in the system.

19:15.809 --> 19:18.011
Hello, hello!

19:18.078 --> 19:20.280
Hi. Who's this?

19:20.348 --> 19:22.883
Agent Bering,
this is Courtney Moore

19:22.951 --> 19:24.685
from KTRD news.

19:24.752 --> 19:27.855
We have an interview
scheduled for now, right?

19:27.922 --> 19:29.857
Yes. We were
just finishing up.

19:29.925 --> 19:31.359
Courtney's been
very supportive.

19:31.426 --> 19:34.161
She's given my daughter's story
lots of airtime.

19:34.229 --> 19:36.630
People need to know
about this tragedy.

19:36.698 --> 19:38.498
Agent Bering, is it?
Yes.

19:38.566 --> 19:41.367
Still investigating? 'Cause we
have the killer in custody.

19:41.435 --> 19:42.702
Geoffery Cedolia did it.

19:42.769 --> 19:44.303
Alleged killer.

19:44.370 --> 19:46.204
My agency
isn't quite done yet.

19:46.272 --> 19:48.340
Typical government waste.

19:48.408 --> 19:50.541
My viewers
already know the truth.

19:50.609 --> 19:52.343
How nice
for your viewers.

19:52.411 --> 19:54.679
So if you'll excuse us.
We should get started.

19:54.747 --> 19:55.847
- Yes.
- Thank you so much

19:55.915 --> 19:57.148
for your time.
Thank you.

20:09.763 --> 20:12.864
You know,
I can't help noticing...

20:14.500 --> 20:16.201
Should I guess the rest?

20:16.268 --> 20:18.169
That you put a lot
of pressure on yourself.

20:20.072 --> 20:22.073
Yeah. Silly me, huh?

20:22.140 --> 20:23.641
Just trying to be good
at my job.

20:23.708 --> 20:25.108
What a geekola.

20:25.176 --> 20:26.210
Yeah, but you <i>are</i> good
at your job.

20:26.277 --> 20:28.545
You don't have to try.
Geez.

20:28.613 --> 20:30.680
But, I mean,
I'm not trained like you guys.

20:30.748 --> 20:33.482
I'm not Secret Service,
or ATF, or NSA,

20:33.550 --> 20:35.485
or m-o-u-s-e.

20:35.553 --> 20:37.487
I'm not a real agent.

20:37.555 --> 20:39.990
You're real.

20:40.058 --> 20:41.792
You're also lying.

20:41.860 --> 20:44.295
Wh-what? No.
No, I--

20:44.363 --> 20:45.864
I'm--
I have no training.

20:45.931 --> 20:49.134
No, not about the training.
About caring about the training.

20:49.202 --> 20:52.104
Artie. You wanna
impress him.

20:52.172 --> 20:55.874
Yes! Angela Lansbury,
you've solved the mystery!

20:55.942 --> 20:58.110
Yeah, I wanna
make him proud.

20:58.178 --> 21:00.479
You don't know
how good to me he's been.

21:00.546 --> 21:03.015
I can't--
I can't let him down.

21:03.082 --> 21:04.382
Well, do you think
that he would send you out here

21:04.450 --> 21:05.751
if he wasn't already
proud of you?

21:11.992 --> 21:15.594
You know, I never had
a gay friend before.

21:15.662 --> 21:16.829
Which is weird,
if you think about it,

21:16.896 --> 21:17.897
'cause I'm sort of
fabulous, right?

21:19.566 --> 21:21.667
I mean, I guess there was
Paquito at the institution,

21:21.735 --> 21:23.002
but he was just one
of Susan's personalities,

21:23.069 --> 21:25.137
so I don't think
he really counts.

21:26.606 --> 21:29.208
And I just told you
I was in an institution.

21:29.276 --> 21:31.945
So I guess
today's sharing day.

21:37.217 --> 21:39.485
- Eagle's on the move.
- Bet you my self-esteem

21:39.553 --> 21:42.188
the knife's
in that messenger bag.

21:42.256 --> 21:43.957
Mr. Larsen!

21:44.024 --> 21:45.458
Could we talk to you
for a minute?

21:45.526 --> 21:47.160
Who are you?

21:47.228 --> 21:48.561
We know all about
the knife, Owen.

21:48.629 --> 21:50.029
Just hand it over.

21:50.097 --> 21:51.665
All right.
I knew it wouldn't work.

21:51.732 --> 21:52.899
You got me.

21:52.966 --> 21:53.966
Here!

21:54.034 --> 21:55.935
Aah!

21:56.003 --> 21:57.903
Hey! Oh, my God.
Are you all right?

21:57.971 --> 21:59.338
Yeah, I'm okay.
Just stop him.

21:59.406 --> 22:01.841
Okay. All right.

22:05.512 --> 22:07.847
My knee!

22:11.785 --> 22:13.252
Aah!

22:15.856 --> 22:18.057
- Artie, what--
- He's getting away!

22:21.361 --> 22:22.628
What are you doing here?

22:22.696 --> 22:24.297
My knee.
He transferred--

22:24.365 --> 22:25.632
chase him!

22:30.471 --> 22:32.173
What are you doing here?

22:32.240 --> 22:34.842
What? Nothing.
Nothing.

22:34.909 --> 22:36.844
Just, you know, I finished
in Manchester early,

22:36.911 --> 22:38.712
and I thought
I'd swing through Boston.

22:38.780 --> 22:39.780
For the Red Sox

22:39.848 --> 22:42.049
and...chowder.

22:42.117 --> 22:43.884
You were spying on me.

22:43.952 --> 22:44.952
No.

22:45.019 --> 22:46.286
Claudia!

22:49.458 --> 22:51.926
Hey, you really need to
work on your timing.

22:54.796 --> 22:57.465
Mrs. Bell, we were hoping
to talk to your son Eric

22:57.533 --> 22:59.234
about Geoffery's case.

22:59.301 --> 23:00.802
Then we heard you
brought him here this morning,

23:00.870 --> 23:02.437
after he was affected.

23:02.505 --> 23:04.673
- Geoffy? Is Geoffy here?
- No, honey.

23:04.741 --> 23:06.375
He can't come play.

23:06.443 --> 23:08.043
Eric and Geoffery
have been friends

23:08.111 --> 23:10.146
since kindergarten.

23:10.213 --> 23:12.348
I wanna play with Geoffy!

23:12.415 --> 23:15.551
My son, he's been
like this all day.

23:15.618 --> 23:17.219
What is wrong with him?

23:17.287 --> 23:18.953
I'm sorry,
but we don't know yet.

23:19.021 --> 23:21.189
He's the third victim now.

23:21.257 --> 23:23.758
There was a reporter
at Amy's mother's house.

23:23.826 --> 23:25.059
Her name
was Courtney Moore.

23:25.127 --> 23:28.162
Has Eric had any kind
of interaction with her

23:28.230 --> 23:29.731
by chance?

23:29.798 --> 23:31.999
Well, she's been speaking
with a lot of the witnesses.

23:32.067 --> 23:33.534
Why?

23:33.602 --> 23:35.737
Courtney could be hitting
every witness, one by one.

23:35.804 --> 23:37.372
Courtney? Who's that?

23:37.440 --> 23:39.374
Well, she's the reporter.
I told you.

23:39.442 --> 23:41.810
God, don't you listen
to anything that--

23:41.878 --> 23:43.513
Pete...

23:45.749 --> 23:47.584
Pete, what's happening?

23:50.355 --> 23:51.455
Pete!

23:54.392 --> 23:57.494
Whoa, man,
you're hot.

23:58.696 --> 23:59.763
Who are you?

23:59.830 --> 24:01.397
Pete, you...

24:12.866 --> 24:14.667
Hey!

24:14.734 --> 24:16.101
Hi.

24:16.169 --> 24:18.003
Are--are--
Pete, are you comfortable?

24:18.071 --> 24:20.340
Do you need anything?

24:20.407 --> 24:22.643
No, I feel good.

24:22.710 --> 24:24.378
You're pretty.

24:24.445 --> 24:28.115
Okay, that's--
that's gotta stop right now.

24:28.183 --> 24:31.819
Um, okay,
Pete, listen to me.

24:34.656 --> 24:37.090
I'm gonna fix this.

24:37.158 --> 24:38.992
Everything is gonna be
all right, I promise.

24:39.060 --> 24:42.562
I want everybody
to stop saying that.

24:42.630 --> 24:44.997
'Cause it's not gonna be.

24:45.065 --> 24:46.566
It's never gonna be
all right again.

24:46.633 --> 24:49.268
Why would you say that?

24:49.336 --> 24:52.137
I mean, why wouldn't everything
be all right, huh?

24:53.873 --> 24:56.508
'Cause my dad died.

24:58.512 --> 25:00.212
And he's not coming home.

25:02.383 --> 25:03.416
Right.

25:07.589 --> 25:09.824
I'm so sorry.

25:09.891 --> 25:11.225
Pete...

25:11.293 --> 25:13.561
It must...

25:13.629 --> 25:14.963
Be hard for you.

25:18.234 --> 25:21.135
It's hard on my mom.

25:21.203 --> 25:24.172
I don't see her that much
since he died.

25:24.240 --> 25:25.941
She tries to stay busy

25:26.008 --> 25:27.910
so she doesn't miss him
that much.

25:31.081 --> 25:32.748
I guess...

25:32.816 --> 25:36.620
That must feel like
maybe you're...

25:36.687 --> 25:38.622
Losing her
a little bit too.

25:42.093 --> 25:44.794
You still have
your sister, though.

25:44.862 --> 25:47.197
Right?

25:47.265 --> 25:49.366
Yeah.

25:49.433 --> 25:50.801
But...

25:50.868 --> 25:53.870
She's gonna go to college
in a couple years.

25:58.041 --> 26:00.109
Everybody
keeps leaving me.

26:05.549 --> 26:07.950
What the hell
are you doing to people

26:08.018 --> 26:09.685
and why?

26:09.753 --> 26:13.121
Agent Bering.
Hello to you too.

26:13.189 --> 26:14.656
So we're doing
a little show here,

26:14.724 --> 26:16.558
and since you're currently
not making any sense,

26:16.626 --> 26:17.926
I'm just gonna ignore you.

26:17.994 --> 26:20.095
My partner Pete is regressing
like the others.

26:20.163 --> 26:22.731
Now, what are you using
to make this happen?

26:22.799 --> 26:24.166
Look, those people
aren't sick.

26:24.234 --> 26:26.401
They dropped out because
they know Geoffery's a killer.

26:26.469 --> 26:30.406
I don't know what game
your partner's playing, but...

26:30.473 --> 26:33.275
I mean...who were we?

26:33.343 --> 26:34.643
What is it?

26:34.711 --> 26:37.746
I'm sorry.

26:37.813 --> 26:38.980
What's wrong?

26:41.083 --> 26:43.117
- Courtney...
- Who are you?

26:43.184 --> 26:44.451
Where are we?

26:44.519 --> 26:45.719
Somebody help me!

26:45.787 --> 26:49.556
Courtney, it's okay.
It's okay.

26:49.623 --> 26:51.558
So we just need to figure out
where this guy would go.

26:51.625 --> 26:52.759
Probably has got
a system here.

26:52.826 --> 26:54.060
He's pretty clever,
actually.

26:54.128 --> 26:56.797
Algorithms,
plus cell tower triangulation.

26:56.864 --> 26:58.432
Also...Facebook.

26:58.499 --> 27:02.169
- Do you have any idea--
- Not even the tiniest clue.

27:02.237 --> 27:04.872
What? You're not perfect?

27:12.849 --> 27:15.417
Should we talk about
why you're so upset?

27:15.485 --> 27:17.686
I'm not upset. I'm just
undoing the mess you made here

27:17.754 --> 27:19.087
and redoing it correctly.

27:19.155 --> 27:21.423
Oh, yeah? I did not
come here to spy on you,

27:21.491 --> 27:22.924
not the way
you think anyway.

27:22.992 --> 27:24.425
Oh, sure.
The good kind of spying,

27:24.493 --> 27:25.593
like, here,
have some flowers,

27:25.661 --> 27:27.161
and a puppy,
and some spying.

27:27.229 --> 27:29.330
I came here to see you
in action, dum-dum.

27:29.398 --> 27:31.165
It's your first case
as a non-apprentice.

27:31.232 --> 27:33.934
I--I wanted to be here.

27:34.001 --> 27:36.436
- He's telling the truth.
- Sometimes that's annoying.

27:36.504 --> 27:37.671
That's funny. You're not
the first person to say--

27:37.739 --> 27:38.572
Go.

27:41.443 --> 27:43.077
So you got to see me
screwin' up.

27:43.145 --> 27:44.912
You got a curveball.
We all get 'em.

27:44.979 --> 27:46.913
It's not your fault. And look
how you're not giving up.

27:46.981 --> 27:49.716
That's the girl I know--
uh, woman. Girl.

27:51.752 --> 27:52.952
I'm still proud of you.

27:54.755 --> 27:57.024
- I actually told her that too.
- Means more from Artie.

27:57.091 --> 27:58.225
Fair enough.

27:59.728 --> 28:01.963
I just found Larsen.

28:02.031 --> 28:05.133
And I think I know
why he wanted the knife.

28:05.201 --> 28:06.568
Hey, wait.
Where are you going?

28:06.636 --> 28:07.736
We're about to snag
the artifact.

28:07.804 --> 28:09.071
I'm going home.

28:09.138 --> 28:11.506
Wait, a-Artie.
Artie.

28:11.574 --> 28:14.076
You've got this.
I trust you!

28:18.681 --> 28:20.682
Look, it's not
just your witnesses

28:20.749 --> 28:21.816
that are getting sick now.

28:21.884 --> 28:23.417
It's my partner

28:23.485 --> 28:25.118
and the reporter
Courtney Moore.

28:25.186 --> 28:28.922
How is she connected
to all of this?

28:28.990 --> 28:30.324
Wish I knew.

28:30.391 --> 28:31.792
Maybe Courtney
picked it up

28:31.860 --> 28:33.728
by shoving her microphone
into everybody's face.

28:33.796 --> 28:34.929
She's pretty aggressive.

28:34.997 --> 28:36.098
She only acts tough.

28:36.165 --> 28:37.632
Why do you say that?

28:37.700 --> 28:39.034
'Cause when my attorney
stood up to her,

28:39.102 --> 28:41.036
she folded like laundry.

28:41.104 --> 28:43.639
Sawyer stood up
to Courtney Moore?

28:43.707 --> 28:45.074
Yeah.
She tried that whole ambush

28:45.142 --> 28:47.277
with the microphone routine.

28:47.344 --> 28:48.645
I heard
it went badly for her.

29:01.125 --> 29:03.225
- Oh, my God.
- It's already happening.

29:05.028 --> 29:07.362
You're too late.

29:07.430 --> 29:09.864
You can take me away now.
You're too late.

29:09.932 --> 29:10.798
We're not here
to take you away.

29:10.866 --> 29:11.933
We just want the knife.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.502
He's my son.
It wasn't fair.

29:14.570 --> 29:16.370
Now it is.

29:18.206 --> 29:19.640
Cancer.

29:19.708 --> 29:21.509
Leukemia.

29:21.577 --> 29:23.444
I'm sorry.

29:23.512 --> 29:25.179
I couldn't
just let him die.

29:25.247 --> 29:27.081
He has a little boy.

29:30.018 --> 29:31.686
So you started
researching cures.

29:31.754 --> 29:33.555
Anything.
Even a crackpot theory

29:33.622 --> 29:36.924
on an urban myth website
about Typhoid Mary's knife.

29:36.991 --> 29:39.926
That's why you took the job
at the auction house--

29:39.994 --> 29:41.094
to get the knife.

29:41.162 --> 29:42.496
It sounded insane.

29:42.563 --> 29:43.997
A knife that
could transfer illness?

29:44.065 --> 29:46.766
But when it gave that fellow
my busted knee, well...

29:46.834 --> 29:49.302
But that means...
Now you're sick.

29:49.370 --> 29:50.570
Now it's fair.

29:50.638 --> 29:52.639
My boy's life
is just starting out.

29:52.707 --> 29:55.676
He can watch his son
grow up, protect him.

29:55.744 --> 29:57.545
Now it's fair.

30:01.284 --> 30:05.287
Are you gonna arrest me
for taking the knife?

30:05.355 --> 30:07.290
No.

30:07.358 --> 30:10.827
We don't go after bad guys.
We go after artifacts.

30:10.895 --> 30:12.195
Dad?

30:14.799 --> 30:15.932
What's going on?

30:22.407 --> 30:24.841
You cannot tell Courtney
I showed you this.

30:24.909 --> 30:27.577
She was very specific
about who was allowed to see it.

30:27.645 --> 30:30.113
- Let me guess--no one?
- Ever.

30:30.180 --> 30:31.380
And per her threat,

30:31.448 --> 30:33.950
I would like to keep
my reproductive organs.

30:34.017 --> 30:35.084
I promise.

30:36.353 --> 30:37.955
Mr. Sawyer.

30:38.023 --> 30:39.924
Sir, why are you
defending a murderer?

30:39.992 --> 30:42.794
I'm not. I'm defending a man
accused of murder.

30:42.862 --> 30:43.995
In this country,
there's a difference.

30:44.063 --> 30:45.864
And what about
Amy's family?

30:45.931 --> 30:47.165
I suppose you think
the first amendment

30:47.233 --> 30:48.566
only protects your client?

30:48.634 --> 30:50.301
Who protects his victims?

30:50.369 --> 30:52.370
Okay, powder-puff,
do you realize

30:52.438 --> 30:53.772
the first amendment
protects all of us,

30:53.840 --> 30:55.774
mostly you, because it deals
with freedom of speech.

30:55.842 --> 30:57.442
But you don't mean
the first amendment.

30:57.510 --> 30:59.244
You mean the fifth amendment,
don't you?

30:59.312 --> 31:01.413
Due process.
Yes.

31:02.882 --> 31:04.750
There's gotta be something,
something out of place,

31:04.817 --> 31:08.587
or something...old...

31:08.655 --> 31:09.989
Then again,

31:10.057 --> 31:12.458
you have a dog
in this fight, don't you?

31:12.526 --> 31:13.827
I don't know
what you mean.

31:13.894 --> 31:15.028
Aren't you
pitching your own show

31:15.096 --> 31:16.663
for national syndication?

31:16.731 --> 31:18.632
The tough, vigilante...

31:18.700 --> 31:21.135
Who wears
a tie clip anymore?

31:21.203 --> 31:22.636
If your first target's
found not guilty,

31:22.704 --> 31:24.739
you won't look very marketable,
now, will you?

31:24.807 --> 31:27.843
You're recording
all this, right?

31:29.345 --> 31:31.213
He was grilling her hard.

31:31.281 --> 31:33.782
Like she was on trial.

31:33.850 --> 31:36.385
I don't usually
feel sorry for her, but--

31:36.452 --> 31:38.687
Everyone affected
was questioned by Sawyer.

31:38.754 --> 31:42.024
Courtney, his witnesses
during trial prep...

31:42.091 --> 31:43.625
Pete said
he went after him too.

31:46.429 --> 31:49.431
While he was wearing
that tie clip, I bet.

31:55.187 --> 31:57.302
Look, they'll be bringing
Geoffery out any minute,

31:57.303 --> 31:59.571
and I need
to see him alone.

31:59.638 --> 32:01.139
I would not damage
my own case.

32:01.207 --> 32:02.473
Of course not.

32:02.541 --> 32:04.075
Mr. Sawyer, look,

32:04.143 --> 32:07.945
I think someone found
a way to use you.

32:08.013 --> 32:09.613
How long have you had
that tie clip?

32:09.681 --> 32:11.315
What, this?
A week maybe.

32:11.383 --> 32:13.751
It was left as a gift.
No note.

32:13.819 --> 32:16.387
This might sound silly...

32:16.455 --> 32:18.589
I feel confident
when I wear it.

32:18.657 --> 32:21.225
A week. That's right
when it started.

32:21.293 --> 32:22.893
When what started?

32:22.961 --> 32:24.228
No, please don't ask me
any questions.

32:24.296 --> 32:25.896
I think that's
what causes this thing--

32:25.964 --> 32:27.665
may I?

32:32.305 --> 32:34.306
W.W.

32:35.508 --> 32:37.276
Asking questions.

32:37.343 --> 32:38.877
Walter Winchell.

32:38.945 --> 32:41.146
Good call. Look at
this old photograph.

32:41.214 --> 32:42.781
Winchell was famous
for pulling information

32:42.848 --> 32:45.584
out of people.

32:45.651 --> 32:48.353
Wait, Leena,
can you show me his hands?

32:50.990 --> 32:52.891
It's the same as
the tie clip.

32:52.958 --> 32:54.325
They're a set.

32:54.393 --> 32:57.161
You think
it's a bifurcated artifact?

32:57.229 --> 32:59.697
If the tie clip
pulls memories out of people,

32:59.765 --> 33:01.866
then maybe the cufflinks
put them back in.

33:01.933 --> 33:04.269
After all, Winchell
didn't leave a trail

33:04.337 --> 33:06.137
of brain-dead interviewees.

33:06.205 --> 33:08.140
I need to find
those cufflinks,

33:08.208 --> 33:11.343
and I bet you know
where they are.

33:11.411 --> 33:13.279
I did some digging.

33:13.347 --> 33:15.448
There was
a young cub reporter

33:15.516 --> 33:16.916
who worked at
the <i>New York Daily Mirror</i>

33:16.984 --> 33:19.652
in the 1930s when Winchell
was just starting there.

33:19.720 --> 33:21.687
A guy named Louis Thompson.

33:21.755 --> 33:23.722
Leena,
how does that help me?

33:23.790 --> 33:25.458
His granddaughter
Sarah Bell

33:25.525 --> 33:28.794
and her son Eric
live in Seattle.

33:37.404 --> 33:39.671
Where are they?
Where's Eric?

33:39.739 --> 33:42.274
Mrs. Bell checked her son out
about an hour ago.

33:42.342 --> 33:44.944
A miraculous recovery.

33:45.011 --> 33:46.278
It's weird.

33:46.346 --> 33:47.379
He's fine now.

33:54.455 --> 33:56.823
Hey, hey, hey.
Uh, are you leaving?

33:56.891 --> 33:58.525
Yeah, I gotta go stop
a bad guy.

33:58.593 --> 34:00.361
Okay, uh,
I wanna come with you.

34:00.429 --> 34:02.129
No, you--you can't.
It's dangerous.

34:02.197 --> 34:04.098
- But you're leaving.
- I'm coming back.

34:05.834 --> 34:08.268
Pete, I will come back.
I promise.

34:09.670 --> 34:12.206
- Just go. I don't care.
- But...

34:34.228 --> 34:35.262
Agent Bering.

34:37.565 --> 34:39.667
I'd invite you in,
but clearly you've already--

34:39.734 --> 34:41.302
Where are the cuff links?

34:41.370 --> 34:43.504
I don't know
what you're talking about.

34:43.572 --> 34:45.973
You've already used them
on your son, haven't you?

34:49.277 --> 34:51.344
I know that he has
his memory back.

34:51.413 --> 34:53.246
I can't help
those other people.

34:53.315 --> 34:55.116
Of course you can't.

34:55.183 --> 34:58.486
Because you don't want Geoffery
being found innocent.

34:58.554 --> 35:00.388
You don't want the police
looking for the real killer--

35:00.456 --> 35:02.423
your son Eric.

35:02.491 --> 35:04.092
No, you're wrong.

35:04.159 --> 35:05.693
He killed that waitress.

35:05.761 --> 35:07.629
Now, give me
those cufflinks.

35:11.199 --> 35:12.800
Get out.

35:12.868 --> 35:14.201
Or I drop the cufflinks.

35:14.269 --> 35:15.836
They're destroyed forever,

35:15.904 --> 35:19.173
and your partner
never gets better.

35:19.241 --> 35:20.741
As soon as
we're somewhere safe,

35:20.809 --> 35:22.076
I will send them to you,

35:22.144 --> 35:23.645
and you can save everyone.

35:23.712 --> 35:26.614
What if you don't, or what if
the damage is permanent?

35:28.484 --> 35:30.184
You'll have to shoot me.

35:30.252 --> 35:31.385
Think of
those innocent people.

35:31.453 --> 35:34.089
Think of what
you're doing to them.

35:34.156 --> 35:35.290
Mom?

35:37.627 --> 35:39.361
What people
is she talking about?

35:39.429 --> 35:40.762
You said
I was the only one.

35:40.830 --> 35:43.598
Eric, get in the car.

35:43.666 --> 35:46.201
I never should've gone
along with this.

35:46.269 --> 35:49.205
I made a mistake.
I have to pay for that now.

35:49.272 --> 35:50.773
I am not gonna let them
just put you away.

35:50.841 --> 35:52.141
It was an accident!

35:54.411 --> 35:56.278
Please, Ma.

35:56.346 --> 35:57.646
No!

36:45.072 --> 36:45.972
Are you ready?

36:51.362 --> 36:52.729
Whoo!

36:52.748 --> 36:54.682
Whoo! Cool!

36:54.750 --> 36:57.085
You're a sweet kid.

36:57.153 --> 36:59.287
Well, daddy calls me
a charmin' varmint.

37:02.324 --> 37:03.958
Okay.

37:04.026 --> 37:06.060
So...

37:06.128 --> 37:09.831
Okay, Pete, I--
can you look at me?

37:09.898 --> 37:14.068
Okay. Now, I want you
to look at these...

37:14.136 --> 37:16.604
shiny cufflinks.

37:30.588 --> 37:32.823
Mykes.

37:34.059 --> 37:35.193
Yeah.

37:35.260 --> 37:36.928
Yeah.

37:41.900 --> 37:44.101
The world is
such a scary place.

37:44.169 --> 37:46.636
Mr. Sawyer, you never gave up
on your client,

37:46.704 --> 37:49.005
whom we now know
is completely innocent.

37:49.073 --> 37:50.206
Where did you find
the strength

37:50.274 --> 37:51.474
to keep going?

37:53.410 --> 37:55.677
You gotta have faith
in your principles,

37:55.745 --> 37:58.346
even when ignorant people
try to stop you.

37:58.414 --> 38:02.451
Sometimes it seems
like it's nothing but anger.

38:05.121 --> 38:07.089
And violence.

38:14.031 --> 38:16.533
And hurt.

38:16.601 --> 38:19.837
It can be terrifying
when you're out there in it.

38:22.574 --> 38:25.142
But if you know
where to look for it...

38:30.316 --> 38:32.784
The world also has warmth.

38:39.626 --> 38:41.426
And love.

38:46.165 --> 38:48.332
And forgiveness.

38:48.400 --> 38:50.034
I guess I should
get out of this--

38:50.101 --> 38:53.870
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just--just let me talk.

38:55.139 --> 38:56.573
There was something
bothering you,

38:56.674 --> 39:00.478
even though you
didn't know what it was.

39:01.242 --> 39:03.143
We're partners...

39:03.210 --> 39:04.544
Pete.

39:04.612 --> 39:07.849
And I should never have
left the warehouse

39:07.916 --> 39:10.418
without talking to you
first.

39:13.156 --> 39:15.824
All this time, I thought that
you had something to say to me,

39:15.892 --> 39:17.826
but you don't have to
say anything.

39:17.894 --> 39:19.961
I do.

39:20.029 --> 39:23.164
And I think that we both
need me to say it.

39:27.602 --> 39:29.570
I'm sorry.

39:31.539 --> 39:32.905
Thanks.

39:42.916 --> 39:45.151
The world has joy in it.

39:45.219 --> 39:47.320
When you find a place

39:47.388 --> 39:51.125
that allows you
to experience that joy,

39:51.193 --> 39:54.128
when you find people
that make you feel

39:54.196 --> 39:59.666
safe and loved,
like you belong...

39:59.734 --> 40:02.168
You don't walk away
from it.

40:02.236 --> 40:04.137
You fight for it.

40:04.204 --> 40:06.105
It's easy to forget that,
isn't it?

40:08.341 --> 40:10.375
I keep thinking
about this kid Eric.

40:10.443 --> 40:13.344
He'd been dating Amy
in secret for months.

40:13.411 --> 40:16.347
No one knew,
not even his best friend.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.549
But when she
broke it off with him,

40:18.616 --> 40:20.918
he was hurt.

40:20.986 --> 40:24.856
He took Geoffery's car
to confront her, and...

40:24.924 --> 40:26.624
And it ended badly.

40:28.494 --> 40:30.262
Very.

40:30.330 --> 40:32.264
And when his mother
found out, she--

40:32.332 --> 40:33.766
well, she sent
that tie clip

40:33.834 --> 40:36.669
to destroy Geoffery's case.

40:36.737 --> 40:39.806
She thought the memory loss
was temporary, didn't she?

40:39.874 --> 40:42.509
It was still
a terrible thing to do.

40:42.577 --> 40:45.879
But...She was
protecting her son.

40:45.947 --> 40:47.747
Like you thought
you were protecting all of us

40:47.815 --> 40:49.349
when you left.

40:54.621 --> 40:56.555
No one is blaming you
for that,

40:56.623 --> 40:58.657
but the stakes do
get high.

40:58.725 --> 41:01.694
Do you feel equipped
to handle that again?

41:05.166 --> 41:07.067
I just nailed
a one-inch light switch

41:07.135 --> 41:09.703
from 20 feet away.

41:09.770 --> 41:12.272
Yeah, I'm okay.

41:14.142 --> 41:16.510
I just had to...

41:16.578 --> 41:19.513
prove to myself
that I could do it.

41:22.283 --> 41:24.751
There's pressure in any job.
I like this one.

41:24.818 --> 41:25.985
And what about
your relationship

41:26.053 --> 41:27.154
with Agent Lattimer?

41:27.221 --> 41:29.322
Are you able to
move forward?

41:32.059 --> 41:34.494
He's an
extraordinary partner.

41:37.465 --> 41:39.900
Please don't tell him
I said that.

41:47.542 --> 41:49.576
Good then.

41:49.644 --> 41:51.979
We had to know that
you could handle being back.

41:52.047 --> 41:54.715
We also needed you to know
that you could handle it.

41:57.018 --> 41:58.953
