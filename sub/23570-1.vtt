01:06.835 --> 01:08.668
<i>A luminous future
awaits the city of Naples.</i>

01:08.835 --> 01:11.085
<i>The Science and Memory Hub
is soon to become a reality.</i>

01:11.293 --> 01:14.710
<i>The 300-square-kilometer area
of the current maritime station,</i>

01:14.918 --> 01:19.960
<i>is ready to host 1,200 businesses
for approximately 100,000 new jobs.</i>

01:20.168 --> 01:23.751
<i>Deus ex Machina of this project is
the shipping magnate Vittorio Basile,</i>

01:23.918 --> 01:27.251
<i>father of the photosweep,
the light-impulse technology</i>

01:27.418 --> 01:30.126
<i>that enables the recording
and reproduction of reality itself.</i>

01:30.335 --> 01:34.376
<i>Don Vittorio, in one of the thousand
rooms of the 'Megaride' cruise ship,</i>

01:34.585 --> 01:36.918
<i>jewel in the crown of Italian
naval engineering, shows the media</i>

01:37.085 --> 01:40.210
<i>the model of the holographic globe,
that promises to bring to our home</i>

01:40.418 --> 01:43.460
<i>all the wonders of the world and
safeguard them here for all eternity.</i>

01:43.668 --> 01:45.626
<i>The Science and Memory Hub,</i>

01:45.793 --> 01:49.126
<i>a Neapolitan fable that will soon
be discussed worldwide.</i>

01:55.126 --> 01:59.293
CINDERELLA THE CAT

03:39.793 --> 03:41.876
- Mr. Basile.
- Hi, Daddy!

03:42.085 --> 03:45.543
Ah, it's you! You've found
my little princess' slipper.

03:45.793 --> 03:48.376
No, Mia doesn't remember
where she lost it.

03:48.585 --> 03:49.585
I don't know.

03:49.835 --> 03:52.126
Don't despair, little Mia.

03:52.335 --> 03:55.543
I'm sure Mr. Gemito will find it

03:55.751 --> 03:58.835
seeing as we can't take a step
without finding him in our way.

03:59.043 --> 04:01.251
It wasn't my decision to escort you.

04:01.460 --> 04:02.751
Nor mine!

04:02.960 --> 04:04.585
It's the technological hub...

04:04.793 --> 04:07.793
The Science and Memory Hub.

04:08.001 --> 04:11.210
Right, it's this project that puts
you in a difficult position.

04:11.418 --> 04:14.501
And yet I feel at ease here,
I've worked here forever,

04:14.710 --> 04:17.543
I've obtained the port concession
for 80 years

04:17.750 --> 04:19.959
and there are already
many people at work.

04:20.168 --> 04:22.376
That's precisely the point, sir.

04:22.585 --> 04:25.001
I don't like the people
you surround yourself with.

04:25.251 --> 04:27.960
Fine, then get lost!

04:28.168 --> 04:30.960
Seriously, you shouldn't take
certain things so lightly.

04:31.168 --> 04:34.793
You're always serious, Gemito,
always troubled.

04:35.001 --> 04:37.501
Can you spare me your grave tones

04:37.751 --> 04:40.376
at least on my wedding day?

04:40.960 --> 04:42.876
You don't look so well, you know?

04:43.960 --> 04:45.960
It's true, you're right.

04:47.251 --> 04:49.876
But this ship...
I don't understand...

04:50.960 --> 04:53.585
It doesn't seem like a suitable place
for a little girl,

04:53.793 --> 04:56.001
things happen that I can't explain.

04:56.210 --> 04:57.418
These?

04:57.626 --> 05:01.960
No, all that is magnificent...
amazing, sir.

05:02.126 --> 05:06.126
I have no idea how it works,
but I've come to terms with it.

05:06.335 --> 05:07.626
And so?

05:07.835 --> 05:12.251
I know it doesn't make sense,
but sometimes I see things...

05:13.960 --> 05:15.793
that never happened.

05:16.001 --> 05:20.001
The ship is watching us,
recording us, processing us,

05:20.210 --> 05:22.043
it puts us back in the spotlight.

05:23.585 --> 05:25.001
So?

05:25.210 --> 05:27.835
I mean, you think you're here now

05:28.043 --> 05:31.960
but you might be a faded hologram,

05:32.168 --> 05:35.793
an old memory
floating into the future.

05:37.543 --> 05:39.210
You're making fun of me, sir.

05:39.418 --> 05:42.418
Have been from the moment
you set foot on this ship,

05:42.626 --> 05:45.251
but at least I got
a smile out of you.

05:46.168 --> 05:49.251
All right, but now
you've got to take me seriously.

05:49.460 --> 05:53.960
It's 6:00, the ceremony is about
to start and you're still here.

05:54.210 --> 05:55.626
You didn't think to tell me sooner?

05:57.168 --> 06:01.001
Bye, darling. Stay with Gemito,
be a good girl till Daddy gets back?

06:01.210 --> 06:02.418
Yes.

06:02.626 --> 06:06.543
Gemito, will you deactivate the
communications with the outside?

06:06.751 --> 06:09.585
- Do you remember how to do it?
- Yes, but...

06:09.793 --> 06:11.626
Why did you reactivate them?

06:12.376 --> 06:15.376
- Your father's incorrigible, Mia!
- Yep.

06:22.960 --> 06:26.376
<i>I love you so much...</i>

06:29.585 --> 06:34.126
Salvatore,
isn't there any alternative?

06:35.751 --> 06:37.376
To what?

06:38.168 --> 06:39.543
I mean...

06:39.710 --> 06:41.710
he seems like a very good person to me.

06:42.668 --> 06:44.251
Who? The old guy?

06:44.501 --> 06:46.085
He's 50, he's not old.

06:46.335 --> 06:49.168
He's a man of integrity with many
wonderful projects for this city.

06:49.418 --> 06:52.335
Yeah, right,
the "Science and Idiocy Hub"!

06:52.960 --> 06:55.460
- What's so funny?
- What's so funny, Angelica?

06:56.085 --> 06:58.543
To put a Science hub
in the port of Naples

06:58.751 --> 07:01.043
is like giving a silver fork
to a starving man.

07:01.251 --> 07:03.626
It means you want to mock them,
to piss them off.

07:04.376 --> 07:06.543
These are the people who ruined us.

07:06.751 --> 07:09.293
They were born into wealth
and think they know people's needs

07:09.460 --> 07:11.460
'cause they've read two books.

07:11.668 --> 07:14.876
Two books? He's got a library
as big as this ship!

07:15.126 --> 07:18.543
Anyway, I think
he's a respectable man.

07:18.751 --> 07:20.126
Baby...

07:22.460 --> 07:24.668
Look at me.

07:26.085 --> 07:28.085
You're not in love with that moron,
are you?

07:28.251 --> 07:29.960
In love, absolutely not!

07:30.168 --> 07:34.460
But he's sweet
and I think he really loves me.

07:35.210 --> 07:39.043
Why rub him out? A guy like him, I
can wind him around my little finger.

07:39.251 --> 07:42.751
How often have we done it?
I'll turn him into a puppet.

07:43.001 --> 07:46.793
Listen, Salvatore Lo Giusto
warns first, then shoots second.

07:47.126 --> 07:49.085
I don't know what you've got in mind,

07:49.251 --> 07:52.668
anyway, by noon,
Don Vittorio Basile is a dead man

07:52.960 --> 07:56.751
and you, Angelica Carannante,
his bride, though mine body and soul

07:57.001 --> 08:00.710
and that's a fact, will be
his widow and that's a fact too.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.668
Got it, baby?

08:07.210 --> 08:09.335
Don't look at me like that,

08:09.793 --> 08:11.876
we decided this together.

08:12.085 --> 08:15.085
I'm doing it for us, for me and you.

08:15.376 --> 08:16.918
Come here...

08:18.418 --> 08:22.543
Think of when we'll be rich,
important, happy.

08:24.085 --> 08:26.001
I'll be the king

08:27.085 --> 08:29.085
and you'll be my queen.

08:29.751 --> 08:31.668
Salvatore...

08:32.001 --> 08:34.126
how much longer
are you going to make me wait?

08:34.376 --> 08:38.085
Mrs. Angelica Basile,
remember that as of tonight

08:38.335 --> 08:40.335
you are a married lady.

08:40.543 --> 08:43.543
Won't you mourn this loss
at least for a while?

08:44.418 --> 08:46.710
What will we do with the little girl?

08:47.043 --> 08:48.960
We'll wait until
she's old enough to sign.

08:49.251 --> 08:53.501
- Meanwhile who looks after her, me?
- You've got six kids, Angelica.

08:53.668 --> 08:55.376
One more, one less...
What's the difference?

08:55.585 --> 08:57.001
Bye, bye.

08:57.168 --> 08:58.918
And make that thing shut up!

09:01.751 --> 09:04.751
<i>I love you so much...</i>

09:15.751 --> 09:18.335
<i>Why is it that when you see me</i>

09:20.043 --> 09:22.751
<i>you get as mad as a cat?</i>

09:24.293 --> 09:27.210
<i>Baby, whatever did I do to you</i>

09:27.501 --> 09:31.293
<i>that you don't want me around?</i>

09:31.585 --> 09:33.918
<i>I have given you so much love</i>

09:35.376 --> 09:38.543
<i>You know that's true</i>

09:41.293 --> 09:44.043
<i>I love you so much</i>

09:45.376 --> 09:47.376
<i>and you don't care for me</i>

09:48.668 --> 09:52.418
<i>I love you so much</i>

09:53.168 --> 09:55.293
<i>but you don't care for me</i>

10:02.876 --> 10:04.626
Calm down, calm down...

10:04.835 --> 10:07.251
Tonight isn't about me.

10:07.460 --> 10:10.293
The woman who can swindle me
is yet to be born.

10:10.585 --> 10:12.210
I've known Don Vittorio
since we were kids,

10:12.418 --> 10:15.043
at 18 they already called him
"the scientist".

10:15.210 --> 10:18.918
Noble blood, an important family
of developers, inventors

10:19.126 --> 10:20.501
and he is no less.

10:21.210 --> 10:25.126
He's got slightly outlandish projects
like this ship,

10:25.335 --> 10:27.626
the ship of ghosts.

10:27.835 --> 10:30.251
But as Angelica says, he's a genius.

10:30.501 --> 10:32.960
A great shipowner, rich,
intelligent, optimist...

10:33.126 --> 10:35.960
He only picked the wrong city.

10:37.918 --> 10:39.376
And then Angelica...

10:39.543 --> 10:41.668
What-a-woman!

10:42.251 --> 10:44.876
Of course,
she doesn't have blue blood,

10:45.626 --> 10:48.251
an important family only
from a numerical point of view:

10:48.460 --> 10:51.751
third of seven daughters
and with six kids depending on her.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.793
But innate elegance,

10:55.001 --> 10:58.835
an exceptional beauty!

10:59.043 --> 11:00.335
Yessir!

11:00.543 --> 11:02.335
That's how fairy tales begin.

11:03.585 --> 11:05.793
Or is this already a happy ending?

11:06.418 --> 11:09.835
All I know is that this is love,
folks!

11:10.418 --> 11:12.835
Do you remember love?

11:13.043 --> 11:14.668
Here it is!

11:14.876 --> 11:17.293
Let's hear it for the bride.

11:30.210 --> 11:31.585
Mama looks so beautiful.

11:31.876 --> 11:34.126
She looks like a princess.

11:34.418 --> 11:38.335
- I'm going to cry.
- Luigi, are you wearing mascara?

11:38.585 --> 11:40.960
Of course, it's Mama's wedding!

11:41.251 --> 11:42.376
Is that lipstick mine?

11:42.543 --> 11:44.918
Yes, I love this color.

11:45.085 --> 11:46.376
Don't touch my makeup.

11:46.543 --> 11:49.668
- I've told you, it's gross!
- Shut up!

11:50.001 --> 11:53.710
What did Mama say?
We can't make her look bad.

11:54.043 --> 11:55.543
There are important people here.

11:55.918 --> 12:00.626
What a handsome man the shipowner is.
What elegance, what style.

12:00.793 --> 12:02.251
Yes, absolutely, Anna.

12:02.835 --> 12:04.376
He's too handsome.

12:04.543 --> 12:06.376
And you're too queer.

12:06.710 --> 12:08.960
Here's the best part.

12:09.168 --> 12:11.251
I now declare you man and wife.

12:11.501 --> 12:13.918
- That's Daddy.
- Yes, see?

12:14.168 --> 12:16.376
Now they're husband and wife.

12:16.585 --> 12:18.585
Yes, I'm with the kid.

12:18.793 --> 12:21.210
Leo's on the west wing, I believe.

12:21.460 --> 12:22.335
Yes, sir.

12:24.001 --> 12:27.626
And now let the real party begin!

13:10.918 --> 13:12.710
Someone's shot Don Vittorio!

13:24.501 --> 13:27.710
It's a tragedy, it's a tragedy!

13:31.751 --> 13:33.960
The little girl is under my care now,

13:34.460 --> 13:38.043
these incompetents
must leave at once.

14:13.835 --> 14:17.085
ACE OF CLUBS

14:53.376 --> 14:55.710
Cinderella!

15:05.126 --> 15:06.543
Negative.

15:06.751 --> 15:09.960
Neither in the crate, nor in the
shoe, I'm going through it all.

15:10.168 --> 15:14.585
Forget about it, bring the shoe here
and we'll analyze it better.

15:14.793 --> 15:17.960
- But now close the crate.
- Wait, it must be somewhere.

15:18.168 --> 15:19.668
Maybe it's not in all the crates.

15:19.918 --> 15:22.126
But you can't open them all.

15:22.335 --> 15:25.543
Gemito, your mission ends here.

15:25.751 --> 15:28.376
Inspector, what we're looking for
must be here somewhere.

15:28.585 --> 15:32.168
I'm not giving up, if I don't find it
I'll go aboard and get it back.

15:32.710 --> 15:36.710
Gemito, this is not advice,
it's an order, got that?

15:36.918 --> 15:40.335
<i>The ship's communications
are shielded, there's no contact.</i>

15:40.543 --> 15:43.168
<i>Besides, you have some precedents
in the ship,</i>

15:43.418 --> 15:45.126
the cover wouldn't hold up.

15:45.335 --> 15:48.168
You're behaving unreasonably!

15:48.418 --> 15:52.335
With all due respect, I volunteered
for this job and I'll see it through.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.501
This guy's lost his mind!

15:55.460 --> 15:57.043
This is insubordination,

15:57.210 --> 16:00.918
<i>don't you realize? I'm calling you
back to order for the last time!</i>

16:01.085 --> 16:03.835
Hey, Prince Charming!
What the fuck are you up to?

16:04.043 --> 16:05.626
Fuck off, James,
you gave me a fright.

16:05.793 --> 16:09.210
Get your hands off that!
Damned all be the Chinamen!

16:09.376 --> 16:11.210
Don't sweat it.

16:11.376 --> 16:12.793
We'll just tell them it fell.

16:13.085 --> 16:17.085
What's in that head of yours? Shit?
You'll get us in trouble!

16:17.335 --> 16:20.626
There are 100 more crates, they won't
notice if we take a few grams.

16:20.793 --> 16:23.543
Think again, Prince Charming!

16:23.918 --> 16:25.293
You can't pull one over on the King!

16:25.585 --> 16:29.710
He knows how to make shoes properly,
he's no Chinaman!

16:30.085 --> 16:33.668
He hides the stuff real good.

16:34.001 --> 16:35.210
Asshole!

16:36.585 --> 16:37.710
What time is the King arriving?

16:37.876 --> 16:40.835
- How thrilling that he's coming.
- Let's hope he makes it on time.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.751
So exciting!

16:42.960 --> 16:45.668
Wow, my legs are trembling!

16:46.001 --> 16:47.918
Boy, am I gorgeous tonight!

16:48.126 --> 16:49.335
Listen to her!

16:49.543 --> 16:53.751
When the King sees me,
he'll change his mind and marry me.

16:54.001 --> 16:55.501
Fatty!

16:55.793 --> 16:57.960
Maybe he'll change sides
and marry me instead!

16:58.543 --> 17:00.793
Go ahead and laugh, you broomstick!

17:01.085 --> 17:05.001
The King likes flesh,
besides he's a man, not a faggot!

17:10.085 --> 17:11.585
I <i>lefuse</i> to get shot because of you.

17:11.792 --> 17:14.585
I'll speak to them
and then you can deal with it.

17:14.792 --> 17:20.335
First of all, Chinaman, you better see
if they understand you when you talk.

17:21.085 --> 17:24.210
Secondly...
shut up!

17:24.460 --> 17:28.335
I already told you that Chinamen
don't have the <i>light</i> to speak.

17:29.210 --> 17:31.126
This pipsqueak thinks he gets a say!

17:31.376 --> 17:32.918
Leave it, James.

17:33.085 --> 17:35.376
He knows if he talks
the three of us have had it.

17:35.585 --> 17:38.001
We've had it anyway
thanks to your <i>lubbish</i>.

17:38.293 --> 17:40.293
"Your <i>lubbish</i>!"
"Your <i>lubbish</i>!"

17:40.543 --> 17:45.376
Chinaman, I'll see that you've damn
well had it if you don't shut up!

17:49.960 --> 17:52.293
You're pissing yourself, huh?

17:52.501 --> 17:53.960
Fuck you, James!

17:54.210 --> 17:57.335
To hell with all the Chinese...
except Bruce Lee.

17:58.418 --> 18:00.543
He was cool, unlike you!

18:00.751 --> 18:02.293
Guys, look!

18:02.501 --> 18:05.585
<i>The King's shoes, fairytale shoes.</i>

18:05.793 --> 18:09.418
<i>Perfect, refined, cut out for you.</i>

18:12.335 --> 18:14.835
They're almost here.

18:15.251 --> 18:17.751
I didn't understand, I can't hear...

18:18.126 --> 18:20.126
A clean job, got it.

18:20.418 --> 18:23.376
Are you crazy? Not all three!

18:23.668 --> 18:28.126
James is onboard too, he's cool,
he's a friend.

18:28.418 --> 18:29.376
All right then...

18:30.168 --> 18:33.001
I won't make a big deal about it.

18:33.293 --> 18:36.043
As you wish...
Piece of shit!

18:36.335 --> 18:38.085
- What did he say, James too?
- Yeah.

18:38.418 --> 18:42.501
That's bullshit, he's cool,
I can vouch for him.

18:42.793 --> 18:45.418
- That's what I told him.
- And?

18:45.710 --> 18:48.626
- Couldn't give a shit.
- Then we gotta do it.

18:49.001 --> 18:52.501
- I'm kinda sorry.
- Me too.

19:10.710 --> 19:13.460
Still better than where you live.

19:23.001 --> 19:24.710
It's true, you're right.

19:28.126 --> 19:31.043
And this would be
the port of a big city?

19:38.585 --> 19:42.210
What happened to this crate?
You been messing with the crates?

19:42.460 --> 19:44.543
It must have fallen, relax,
we didn't lose anything.

19:44.793 --> 19:47.960
- If it fell, I didn't drop it.
- Hey Scar!

19:48.251 --> 19:49.876
How do I know it's all in order?

19:50.168 --> 19:54.626
Scar, you have my word,
the Chinaman is a butterfingers.

19:54.876 --> 19:57.043
- For pity's sake!
- But it's all in order.

19:57.335 --> 20:00.501
So, it's the Chinaman's fault?
Why doesn't the asshole speak up?

20:00.835 --> 20:02.960
Because I'm training him well.

20:03.251 --> 20:06.335
I taught him Chinamen
must keep their <i>tlap</i> shut.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.293
Fuck you, James.

20:09.043 --> 20:10.251
Nice work!

20:10.460 --> 20:13.085
Chinaman, if there's anything
missing in here...

20:13.335 --> 20:14.710
Got it?

20:15.085 --> 20:18.376
Enough of this bullshit,
that fucking crate was opened by...

20:20.751 --> 20:23.126
No two ways about it,
these fucking Chinese

20:23.418 --> 20:25.335
don't wanna <i>complehend</i>.

20:26.168 --> 20:27.668
And now what do we do
with the Chinaman?

20:28.001 --> 20:30.501
Hold on,
I'm still getting over James...

20:30.793 --> 20:32.335
Darn you!

20:32.626 --> 20:36.210
Put him in an empty crate
and bring him inside.

20:36.460 --> 20:38.585
You two go to the Ace of Clubs,

20:38.918 --> 20:42.210
I got passes for the balconies
in your names.

20:42.460 --> 20:45.126
- And the Chinaman's pass?
- I've shot him now.

20:45.418 --> 20:49.960
The Chinaman's pass...
put it in his coffin, he earned it.

21:22.251 --> 21:24.168
Do you two always need
to make a racket?

21:24.418 --> 21:26.543
Where's that tramp gone, anyway?

21:26.710 --> 21:27.585
Cinderella the Cat?

21:27.751 --> 21:31.335
Who else?
The Cat! The Cat!

21:31.626 --> 21:35.210
Who knows, she's always crawling
through the air ducts.

21:35.460 --> 21:39.043
Maybe she's spying on us,
that nosy tramp!

21:40.793 --> 21:42.585
- Mama!
- Anna, Sofia, Barbara...

21:42.793 --> 21:45.043
While Luisa and Carmen
are performing this evening,

21:45.251 --> 21:46.501
there's a little job for you
in the balconies.

21:46.668 --> 21:49.043
A dirty job?

21:49.335 --> 21:51.251
No, this is serious, Sofia.

21:51.793 --> 21:53.418
A clean job.

21:53.626 --> 21:55.835
Don't make me worry,
take precautions.

21:56.043 --> 21:58.210
No, you can't do this to us,

21:58.460 --> 22:00.460
not tonight that the King's here!

22:00.876 --> 22:04.085
It's to please the King
that you must do this job.

22:04.376 --> 22:07.793
Don't worry, we're always ready,
we always do our job.

22:08.085 --> 22:09.835
But Cinderella's got to clean up.

22:10.001 --> 22:12.251
Of course! Now get ready.

22:12.460 --> 22:16.626
Luigi, stick around, in case
one of your sisters needs help.

22:16.918 --> 22:18.626
I'll take care of it, don't worry.

22:19.793 --> 22:21.251
Who's going to pay us now?

22:21.460 --> 22:23.335
The money will be waiting
in the balcony.

22:23.626 --> 22:25.043
What are these balconies?

22:25.293 --> 22:27.376
Where have you been living?

22:27.668 --> 22:29.168
In La La Land?

22:29.418 --> 22:31.960
The balconies are up on top.

22:32.293 --> 22:34.376
That means they bring the show
into your room.

22:34.710 --> 22:38.335
You just have to hope
you don't get the sixth sister.

22:38.626 --> 22:42.751
- Why, what's with the sixth sister?
- She's got a surprise downstairs.

22:43.085 --> 22:46.210
But what do I know,
you might like it.

22:47.543 --> 22:49.376
<i>Gemito, do you copy?</i>

22:50.168 --> 22:52.418
What's wrong, you got a sore throat?

22:52.710 --> 22:56.210
Don't go in there, find an excuse
and come back.

22:56.460 --> 22:58.585
Got a sore throat, Prince Charming?

22:58.876 --> 23:00.043
I got a chill on the rubber boat.

23:00.210 --> 23:02.835
So you wanna go home to your wife?

23:03.085 --> 23:05.710
No, nobody's waiting for me.

23:06.543 --> 23:09.043
He's walking into a death trap.

23:10.543 --> 23:15.376
I shouldn't have given
a delicate job like this to a madcap!

23:16.960 --> 23:18.960
<i>Gemito, you're a moron!</i>

23:28.543 --> 23:30.001
Cinderella!

23:42.793 --> 23:44.210
Cinderella!

23:44.460 --> 23:46.835
As if that cat's gonna answer...

24:18.793 --> 24:21.793
You want me to believe
you were already here?

24:22.626 --> 24:25.710
Don't go wandering around,
you're supposed to stay here.

24:28.126 --> 24:31.126
You always say yes,
but then you do as you please.

24:31.793 --> 24:33.918
Help me do up this dress.

24:42.418 --> 24:44.835
Are these your exercises?

24:45.960 --> 24:47.793
Don't tell me
you're pleased with them!

24:48.418 --> 24:50.251
Your handwriting's shit.

24:50.460 --> 24:53.085
You should practice more
instead of traipsing around.

24:53.293 --> 24:55.293
Are you done with my dress?

24:55.793 --> 24:58.210
Listen up, little one.

24:58.418 --> 25:02.043
You need to do what I say
and do it well.

25:02.251 --> 25:03.876
Tomorrow you turn 18

25:04.085 --> 25:08.293
and it seems to me that you've
become slightly full of yourself.

25:09.293 --> 25:10.960
Am I right?

25:11.126 --> 25:13.668
No?
Do you take me for a fool?

25:14.210 --> 25:17.418
The fact that you're coming of age
doesn't mean a thing,

25:17.626 --> 25:21.043
because you're an ignorant child,
you can't even sign your own name.

25:21.585 --> 25:25.751
If I didn't look after you,
you'd come to a bad end.

25:25.960 --> 25:27.585
Because as I've already told you,

25:27.835 --> 25:31.793
you're a little girl
with problems, right?

25:34.126 --> 25:37.751
Now listen carefully
to what I tell you to do.

25:37.960 --> 25:41.585
After the six sisters' show,
you must tidy things as you know how.

25:42.460 --> 25:44.460
Is that clear, little one?

25:45.418 --> 25:47.626
Now go and clean up my room.

25:47.835 --> 25:51.251
And remember to wash your hands
before you touch my things.

26:08.418 --> 26:12.001
<i>Give me a good reason
to stay here in this squalor.</i>

26:12.668 --> 26:16.876
<i>What do you want me to say, Gemito?
You're not from here, I get it,</i>

26:17.126 --> 26:20.210
<i>but my family built its fortune
in this city,</i>

26:20.460 --> 26:21.751
<i>in this port.</i>

26:21.960 --> 26:26.585
<i>If I had your intelligence,
I would have tried my luck elsewhere.</i>

26:26.793 --> 26:29.043
<i>Maybe you're smarter, Gemito.</i>

26:29.210 --> 26:33.168
<i>You won't let the past, history,
memory screw you like it did me.</i>

26:33.668 --> 26:35.793
<i>You'll weigh the anchor
and go far away.</i>

26:36.710 --> 26:38.793
<i>I hope I'll know
you're somewhere else next year.</i>

26:39.043 --> 26:40.876
<i>I hope so for your sake, truly.</i>

26:41.085 --> 26:44.793
<i>You just need to be careful
with your affections.</i>

26:55.210 --> 26:57.793
Mr. Lo Giusto,
if you'll forgive my asking...

26:58.043 --> 27:01.126
Could we put the window up
a little bit?

27:01.376 --> 27:05.376
As you've surely noticed, apart
from the cold, it's also rather damp.

27:06.793 --> 27:08.626
Mr. Lo Giusto?

27:09.001 --> 27:11.001
My dear Cozza...

27:12.376 --> 27:14.585
- Can you smell this stench?
- Y-Yes.

27:14.793 --> 27:16.710
Do you know how long it is
since I've been back?

27:17.626 --> 27:19.626
At least two years.

27:19.793 --> 27:22.585
I'm perfectly aware,
but if you'll allow me...

27:22.793 --> 27:25.835
If we wanted to keep the window open,
we could have come back in summer.

27:26.043 --> 27:29.126
But you know
that would not have been possible.

27:29.335 --> 27:33.418
Of course, because the girl
needs to sign when the time comes.

27:33.626 --> 27:37.251
But, in all truth, this marriage
could have been brought forward.

27:37.793 --> 27:40.710
- How about we close the window?
- Sure...

27:40.960 --> 27:42.626
- Good!
- Sure, we could have done it then.

27:43.501 --> 27:47.210
We could have gotten married
after the mourning was over.

27:47.418 --> 27:51.043
You'll agree, the sooner one attends
to certain issues, the better.

27:51.251 --> 27:54.085
- Or else you pay the consequences.
- What do you mean?

27:54.293 --> 27:57.793
I mean that, say the lady puts
her foot down

27:58.001 --> 28:01.626
because she feels neglected,
the guardianship falls on her.

28:01.835 --> 28:06.668
I do say! Such a beautiful woman!
Why ever not marry her sooner?

28:06.876 --> 28:10.085
- Also to avoid certain risks?
- What risks, Cozza?

28:10.335 --> 28:11.543
I am the King!

28:11.751 --> 28:14.168
When I desire a woman,
that woman is mine forever.

28:14.376 --> 28:18.001
The problem is that beauty fades

28:18.251 --> 28:19.876
and I'd end up married to an old hag.

28:20.085 --> 28:22.376
- Praise the Lord!
- What do you mean?

28:22.626 --> 28:26.418
I mean that marrying Lady Angelica
is not just necessary,

28:26.626 --> 28:29.043
but it's also a great fortune.

28:29.626 --> 28:33.460
She's a sensationally beautiful,
elegant woman.

28:33.668 --> 28:37.168
Let us admit, between us men
of a certain virility,

28:37.376 --> 28:39.376
she's also got a remarkable body,
flesh... So voluptuous...

28:39.585 --> 28:41.085
Settle down!

28:41.335 --> 28:43.960
<i>I had a mountain drenched in sun</i>

28:44.251 --> 28:46.751
<i>and many things still to learn</i>

28:47.085 --> 28:49.460
<i>I had five, six, seven children</i>

28:49.751 --> 28:52.001
<i>and so many beautiful things
yet to come</i>

28:57.960 --> 29:01.168
<i>I had a window over the sea</i>

29:01.418 --> 29:04.210
<i>The fishermen's lamps
lit up the dark</i>

29:04.460 --> 29:06.918
<i>Stairways wound up through the alleys</i>

29:07.251 --> 29:10.251
<i>And colored flowers
tumbled down the walls</i>

29:16.210 --> 29:20.126
<i>And there's no way of knowing
if you still love me</i>

29:21.793 --> 29:25.168
<i>False things are of no use</i>

29:27.626 --> 29:33.001
<i>And there's no way of knowing
anything since you've been gone</i>

29:33.418 --> 29:37.168
<i>These lies have frightened me</i>

29:44.751 --> 29:47.335
<i>The day I lost everything</i>

29:47.585 --> 29:50.335
<i>You didn't admit
even the slightest excuse</i>

29:50.626 --> 29:53.210
<i>'Cause of that stuff you sniffed
through your nose</i>

29:53.460 --> 29:56.460
<i>You tore away my wedding dress</i>

30:02.043 --> 30:04.251
<i>A beautiful life on earth
can't be found</i>

30:04.501 --> 30:07.501
<i>The evening falls itself
inside and out</i>

30:07.793 --> 30:10.251
<i>And like a moth in the rain</i>

30:10.501 --> 30:13.001
<i>it dies as this heart of mine
strikes midnight</i>

30:19.668 --> 30:23.251
<i>And there's no way of knowing
if you still love me</i>

30:25.960 --> 30:29.293
<i>True things are never lost</i>

30:31.293 --> 30:36.210
<i>And there's no way of knowing
anything since you've gone</i>

30:37.043 --> 30:39.168
<i>Lies have frightened you</i>

30:42.793 --> 30:46.168
<i>Lies have frightened me</i>

30:48.626 --> 30:51.376
<i>Lies have frightened us</i>

30:56.376 --> 30:59.126
Prince, were you getting impatient?

30:59.835 --> 31:02.418
Did I make you wait too long?

31:02.585 --> 31:05.710
Believe me, I'm worth the wait.

31:08.293 --> 31:11.293
I give to you
my gorgeous daughters' show.

31:19.418 --> 31:23.043
- Mr. Cozza...
- May I?

31:23.335 --> 31:25.501
Shall I go ahead... Shall I proceed?

31:25.710 --> 31:29.293
I'm telling you to proceed.
Go, go! Come on!

31:41.251 --> 31:42.543
Genius!

31:43.126 --> 31:45.668
This is truly
a marvel of chemistry!

31:46.585 --> 31:50.210
What are you waiting for? Get
comfortable and take your hat off.

31:50.543 --> 31:52.626
It's late, I've got to go.

31:52.835 --> 31:53.876
- Where?
- Have mercy!

31:54.126 --> 31:57.126
- That's it, you've offended me!
- I really must...

32:01.085 --> 32:02.293
You piece of shit!

32:02.543 --> 32:03.751
Piece of shit!

32:24.210 --> 32:25.543
Piece of sewage!

32:28.585 --> 32:30.168
Luigi!

32:30.335 --> 32:32.335
Get that asshole!

32:40.085 --> 32:42.168
Luigi, are you okay?

32:42.376 --> 32:43.751
Barbarella...

32:43.918 --> 32:46.460
let's kill that piece of shit.

32:48.460 --> 32:50.293
Free coke!

32:56.418 --> 32:57.710
What the fuck more can I say?

33:56.126 --> 33:58.960
<i>I love you so much...</i>

34:03.710 --> 34:07.251
<i>I love you so much</i>

34:08.001 --> 34:10.335
<i>but you don't care for me...</i>

34:11.251 --> 34:13.585
What if we got married?

34:15.543 --> 34:17.335
Don't make fun of me, Don Vittorio.

34:18.168 --> 34:21.376
I'm a lonely woman,
I'm more fragile than you imagine.

34:21.585 --> 34:23.210
Think about it, Angelica,

34:23.418 --> 34:25.626
I could look after you
and all your daughters.

34:25.835 --> 34:28.043
And you could help me with Mia,

34:28.251 --> 34:31.251
you know better than me
how to raise a girl.

34:33.043 --> 34:36.835
Are you serious, Don Vittorio?
Would you really marry me?

34:37.043 --> 34:39.960
You're an enchanting woman, Angelica.

34:40.168 --> 34:42.626
I should be the one begging you.

35:01.918 --> 35:02.793
Behold!

35:10.960 --> 35:11.960
What more can I add?

35:16.376 --> 35:17.668
Fantastic!

36:00.085 --> 36:01.293
How can I say...

36:23.085 --> 36:25.376
And that's the end of that!

36:57.085 --> 36:58.293
Inspector!

36:59.085 --> 37:01.001
- What's going on?
- <i>Ship to base, do you copy?</i>

37:01.210 --> 37:03.501
<i>Ship to base, do you copy?</i>

37:03.710 --> 37:06.710
Gemito, we receive you!

37:06.918 --> 37:09.335
I don't know how the fuck you
managed, but we receive you.

37:09.543 --> 37:11.335
<i>I've made it into the command room.</i>

37:11.543 --> 37:14.460
<i>I can still remember a bit
about how this stuff works.</i>

37:14.710 --> 37:18.335
Are you safe?
Has your presence been noticed?

37:18.543 --> 37:20.543
<i>I've been stabbed.</i>

37:20.751 --> 37:22.585
<i>Luckily I had my vest on underneath.</i>

37:22.793 --> 37:25.626
<i>They knew there was an infiltrator,
I don't think they knew it was me.</i>

37:25.835 --> 37:30.668
Can you hear me? Try to gather some
pictures and get out straightaway!

37:30.876 --> 37:32.376
<i>Wait.</i>

37:32.585 --> 37:34.501
- Gemito, what's going on?
- <i>Just a moment.</i>

37:34.710 --> 37:36.960
- <i>What's going on?</i>
- Just a moment.

37:37.710 --> 37:39.335
<i>Answer!</i>

37:39.543 --> 37:41.376
Just one moment.

37:45.376 --> 37:47.460
<i>Did you see that too, little one?</i>

37:47.668 --> 37:49.085
<i>Yes.</i>

37:58.876 --> 38:00.001
Anyone there?

38:01.710 --> 38:04.001
Gemito, do you copy? Gemito?

38:07.418 --> 38:09.376
There's the asshole!

38:09.835 --> 38:12.543
No point running away, you're fucked!

38:15.001 --> 38:17.210
Please, save your applause
for tomorrow,

38:17.460 --> 38:19.376
that's the big day,

38:19.668 --> 38:21.585
my wedding day.

38:25.418 --> 38:27.251
Secondly:

38:27.460 --> 38:31.085
remember that all these years,
even whilst I was away.

38:31.293 --> 38:33.501
I was working for you,

38:33.710 --> 38:37.543
to transform this port, this city

38:37.751 --> 38:39.001
into a wealthy place,

38:39.168 --> 38:41.751
where there are jobs for everyone!

38:42.835 --> 38:43.876
He went that way!

38:44.918 --> 38:46.418
Get that piece of shit!

38:52.001 --> 38:53.126
Just as well...

38:53.293 --> 38:54.501
Wait!

38:54.710 --> 38:57.085
You spared us the trouble
of bringing your body here.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.668
Wait, let me speak.

38:59.876 --> 39:01.293
Bye-bye, baby!

39:13.376 --> 39:15.793
But now I'm curious...

39:15.960 --> 39:18.085
- About what?
- About what he was going to say?

39:18.376 --> 39:20.918
What could that fag have to say?

39:21.210 --> 39:24.501
Here, you can tell Mama
that you did it.

39:37.085 --> 39:41.085
I'd like to dedicate this number
to my city, to my people.

39:41.293 --> 39:42.710
To you!

39:42.960 --> 39:44.751
Naples, Naples...

39:45.168 --> 39:47.918
You need to be worthy
of being a Neapolitan.

39:52.793 --> 39:56.168
<i>Smells like smoke</i>

39:57.710 --> 40:00.626
<i>They've set the trash cans alight</i>

40:02.501 --> 40:05.293
<i>Two sailors</i>

40:06.460 --> 40:09.835
<i>are pulling up a net</i>

40:10.918 --> 40:14.043
<i>They've caught a wheel at sea</i>

40:14.335 --> 40:16.876
<i>and two tires</i>

40:17.918 --> 40:20.835
<i>Whilst three boys further ahead</i>

40:22.501 --> 40:25.293
<i>are busy mugging people</i>

40:28.501 --> 40:34.126
<i>Smell this air,
it's practically toxic</i>

40:35.918 --> 40:39.043
<i>From Procida to Resina</i>

40:39.335 --> 40:43.418
<i>Smog in Mergellina</i>

40:46.918 --> 40:50.835
<i>where no doubt you gotta hand over</i>

40:51.126 --> 40:54.043
<i>two euros to a junkie</i>

40:54.335 --> 40:57.251
<i>If to stop for a coffee</i>

40:57.918 --> 41:01.251
<i>your car you wish to park</i>

41:03.418 --> 41:06.168
<i>ls there any place in the world</i>

41:07.460 --> 41:12.376
<i>more revolting than Naples tonight?</i>

41:12.668 --> 41:15.585
<i>The common folk round here</i>

41:15.918 --> 41:20.418
<i>are not famous for their honesty</i>

41:21.501 --> 41:25.293
<i>They're a mass of ignorants</i>

41:25.543 --> 41:29.126
<i>thieves and felons</i>

41:30.460 --> 41:32.668
<i>So uncivilized! Completely rotten!</i>

41:34.460 --> 41:37.585
<i>Without an ounce of dignity</i>

41:39.918 --> 41:43.251
<i>And as the moon says:</i>

41:45.501 --> 41:48.293
<i>If in the shit you live</i>

41:48.543 --> 41:50.918
<i>it means it's the shit you love!</i>

41:52.710 --> 41:56.085
<i>We are the chorus</i>

41:57.335 --> 41:59.876
<i>of Naples</i>

42:01.918 --> 42:05.335
<i>Potato peel</i>

42:13.126 --> 42:15.043
<i>Naples</i>

42:15.918 --> 42:19.835
<i>Rotten potato peel</i>

43:21.668 --> 43:22.543
Mia...

43:24.626 --> 43:27.210
Is it really you?

43:28.251 --> 43:29.835
You've got the same eyes.

43:31.001 --> 43:35.585
Look how you've grown,
you've become a real beauty.

43:38.918 --> 43:40.501
Do you know who I am?

43:41.210 --> 43:42.918
I'm Gemito.

43:43.460 --> 43:47.043
I was one of the men in your father's
escort, I was his friend.

43:48.293 --> 43:51.418
Your father... do you remember him?

43:54.835 --> 43:57.918
What happened to your voice,
why aren't you speaking?

43:59.918 --> 44:01.876
Listen to me, little one,
we've got to get out of here.

44:02.501 --> 44:04.335
We've got to escape
from this nightmare.

44:04.543 --> 44:07.543
Do you know if there's an exit
anywhere in the hull?

44:11.460 --> 44:14.460
Come on,
I'm taking you away from here.

44:15.085 --> 44:16.501
Come...

44:18.626 --> 44:21.460
You're right, you don't even know me.

44:22.335 --> 44:27.001
But for me it's different, I know so
many things that you can't remember.

44:29.543 --> 44:31.751
You had that smile
and that light in your eyes...

44:32.001 --> 44:33.668
Like your father, Mia.

44:35.335 --> 44:38.751
The best people I have ever met
in this life.

44:39.918 --> 44:42.918
If he knew you were still here,
he wouldn't rest.

44:45.918 --> 44:48.543
Would you believe me if I said
that I'm here for you?

44:48.751 --> 44:51.751
To save you?
Here, look at this.

44:53.543 --> 44:57.376
I've kept it all these years,
it belongs to you.

45:01.335 --> 45:05.335
It seems like yesterday, searching
the corridors for it hand in hand.

45:06.918 --> 45:08.918
Your father was waiting for us and...

45:10.335 --> 45:13.001
Everything was supposed to go
very differently.

45:14.501 --> 45:17.335
I found it in my pocket when I left
this ship for the last time

45:17.543 --> 45:22.001
and I've often wondered
if it was my memory

45:22.168 --> 45:23.876
or that little girl
playing tricks on me.

45:24.085 --> 45:25.585
<i>Gemito, do you copy?</i>

45:25.793 --> 45:27.293
- Yes, I'm here, Inspector!
- <i>Here where?</i>

45:27.501 --> 45:30.710
In the ship's hold.
It's a cemetery down here.

45:30.918 --> 45:32.418
They'll grant us a search warrant
no doubt...

45:32.585 --> 45:35.918
<i>Take all the pictures you can...
Do you know how to get out of there?</i>

45:36.126 --> 45:39.001
Yessir, there's an opening in the
hull, come get me at the old pier.

45:39.210 --> 45:41.210
<i>Copy that. We'll be waiting for you.</i>

45:41.460 --> 45:43.460
Cinderella!

45:47.251 --> 45:51.168
I won't allow you to stay here, even
if you can't understand why now.

45:52.418 --> 45:55.085
I'll be back to get you, Mia.
I'm taking you away from here.

45:55.960 --> 45:57.835
I promise you. Got that, little one?

46:05.335 --> 46:07.168
Cinderella!

46:08.501 --> 46:10.126
Cinderella!

46:11.418 --> 46:14.126
<i>And so I have returned</i>

46:14.418 --> 46:16.585
<i>And now just like we used to</i>

46:16.876 --> 46:21.126
<i>Let us sing that ancient tune
together</i>

46:22.418 --> 46:26.335
<i>Time goes by and the world changes</i>

46:27.168 --> 46:30.460
<i>But true love never goes astray</i>

46:34.251 --> 46:36.251
Is this how you clean my room,
little bitch?

46:37.251 --> 46:39.543
Is this what Mama told you?

46:39.710 --> 46:42.293
Do you think we're all stupid
like you?

46:43.626 --> 46:45.251
Now clean everything up!

46:45.876 --> 46:49.001
I'll take you to Mama,
that way you can learn your lesson.

46:51.835 --> 46:55.210
<i>With you, my beauty, I fell in love</i>

46:55.460 --> 46:59.043
<i>Do you remember,
in front of the fountain</i>

46:59.335 --> 47:03.751
<i>The water within never runs dry</i>

47:04.626 --> 47:10.543
<i>Like a love wound that never heals</i>

47:13.001 --> 47:15.001
<i>It never heals</i>

47:15.293 --> 47:20.293
<i>Because had it healed</i>

47:20.543 --> 47:22.543
<i>my love</i>

47:22.876 --> 47:27.501
<i>I wouldn't be here to gaze at you</i>

47:27.793 --> 47:31.376
<i>amidst this scented air</i>

47:32.710 --> 47:36.085
<i>And to tell you, my sweetheart</i>

47:37.418 --> 47:41.335
<i>Sweetheart of mine</i>

47:41.626 --> 47:46.210
<i>Spring has returned
and so too has love</i>

47:47.293 --> 47:52.376
<i>Do with me what you will</i>

47:56.418 --> 47:59.043
And here I was
thinking you'd forgotten about me.

47:59.210 --> 48:00.876
You mustn't ever think that.

48:01.043 --> 48:03.335
You disappeared for two years.

48:03.501 --> 48:07.293
Angelica, maybe you don't realize
what we've set up.

48:07.918 --> 48:11.126
Tomorrow at midnight, we, Salvatore
Lo Giusto and Angelica Carannante,

48:11.335 --> 48:13.585
we'll be the richest couple
in the land.

48:13.751 --> 48:16.876
And then, anything you desire,
my love,

48:17.251 --> 48:20.251
even if it's a stupid whim,
we'll buy it anyway.

48:20.501 --> 48:22.710
Money's not everything in life.

48:23.085 --> 48:24.918
What kind of bullshit is that?

48:25.251 --> 48:27.626
It's not bullshit, I know
perfectly well what I'm saying,

48:27.793 --> 48:31.001
I've been making things run here
for 15 years,

48:31.210 --> 48:34.210
keeping this ship up,
looking after that tramp!

48:34.418 --> 48:37.251
You've always sent me money,
and gifts too.

48:37.418 --> 48:39.418
But where were you
when I wanted to sing with you?

48:40.210 --> 48:42.710
Where was my man
when I felt sad and lonely?

48:43.043 --> 48:45.168
I was working, Angelica.

48:46.876 --> 48:48.876
See that blackbird?

48:49.293 --> 48:51.043
Remember how heartily
it would welcome me?

48:51.210 --> 48:54.210
Is that still him? ls he immortal?

48:55.251 --> 48:57.668
It's him, yes,

48:58.626 --> 49:00.543
but he doesn't sing anymore.

49:01.251 --> 49:03.543
He hasn't sung for 15 years.

49:03.876 --> 49:05.418
He must have grown old too.

49:05.751 --> 49:08.210
Come on, I know it hasn't been easy,

49:08.960 --> 49:10.460
for anyone,

49:10.751 --> 49:12.501
but now why are we talking about it?

49:12.793 --> 49:14.501
We've won,

49:14.793 --> 49:16.501
it's time to be happy,

49:16.793 --> 49:18.710
it's time to celebrate.

49:19.210 --> 49:21.960
Mama, this bitch
hasn't cleaned a fucking thing.

49:22.251 --> 49:23.543
You oughta...

49:24.335 --> 49:26.001
Bow down, bitch!

49:27.085 --> 49:29.793
Sorry, but I never imagined...

49:30.043 --> 49:32.918
It's just that this little bitch
does things, I swear...

49:33.335 --> 49:34.626
Is this what I taught you, Anna?

49:34.793 --> 49:36.751
- No, Mama...
- Silence!

49:37.293 --> 49:40.085
Get that filthy tramp
out of my room.

49:40.418 --> 49:41.960
Who's this young thing?

49:42.126 --> 49:43.126
Anna.

49:43.335 --> 49:45.751
The oldest of the six,
don't you recognize her?

49:45.960 --> 49:47.251
Of course, I do.

49:47.751 --> 49:49.585
I meant this other little one.

49:49.793 --> 49:52.251
Her? The trouble
we got landed with 15 years ago.

49:52.626 --> 49:54.918
- This is Mia?
- Yes, she's all yours.

49:55.251 --> 49:57.543
Take this trouble for yourself.

49:57.751 --> 50:00.585
And so, you're little Mia Basile?

50:01.126 --> 50:03.126
What a pretty little mouth.

50:04.043 --> 50:06.001
And what bright eyes!

50:07.835 --> 50:10.293
Doesn't she have really bright eyes?

50:10.543 --> 50:12.543
Who would have thought
you'd grow up so well...

50:13.210 --> 50:14.585
given whose daughter you are.

50:16.876 --> 50:18.293
How true...

50:18.501 --> 50:19.918
How true.

50:22.668 --> 50:25.085
Well? Why don't you speak?

50:25.293 --> 50:27.293
You're not scared of me, are you?

50:27.501 --> 50:30.335
I told you, the girl was traumatized.

50:30.543 --> 50:34.543
Only natural, look how you're
treating this little gem.

50:34.751 --> 50:38.043
I'm surprised at you,
this little girl is our treasure,

50:38.251 --> 50:40.668
the most precious thing on this ship.

50:40.876 --> 50:42.710
And tomorrow's her birthday.

50:43.376 --> 50:46.543
The little princess is about
to become a woman, huh?

50:47.543 --> 50:50.543
Angelica, give her the suite
on the eastern side.

50:50.751 --> 50:52.960
Fill the room with flowers,
perfume, shoes

50:53.168 --> 50:57.085
and everything that ought to be in
the room of a respectable woman.

50:57.293 --> 51:00.710
And above all,
give her a decent dress,

51:00.918 --> 51:03.335
actually, at least ten,
so she can choose.

51:03.543 --> 51:07.543
I've got to go now, I've got
important international guests.

51:07.751 --> 51:09.751
I don't want any surprises.

51:11.251 --> 51:14.168
Mama! Has Don Salvatore gone mad?
Is he serious?

51:15.293 --> 51:17.168
Salvatore is always serious.

51:17.626 --> 51:20.251
And what are you looking at,
you little slut?

51:21.668 --> 51:23.960
You want a new dress? Yes?

51:24.918 --> 51:26.918
- You want the latest fashion?
- Anna!

51:27.168 --> 51:28.585
- The very latest trend?
- Anna!

51:31.418 --> 51:33.126
Do what the King said.

51:33.293 --> 51:36.960
Go call the errand boy
and tell him what he has to do.

51:45.460 --> 51:46.918
Stop your crying.

51:47.126 --> 51:51.126
You're grounded. Don't move
from here until the blackbird sings.

51:55.085 --> 51:58.501
<i>I love you so much...</i>

52:09.585 --> 52:12.210
- Are you done playing the hero?
- No, sir.

52:12.876 --> 52:16.251
Now they have to give us the warrant
and we have to get back in there.

52:16.460 --> 52:18.668
One step at a time, my boy.

52:19.085 --> 52:21.501
First, let's get you
to the infirmary.

52:21.710 --> 52:23.126
Thank you.

52:24.876 --> 52:27.085
<i>The King's wedding!</i>

52:27.335 --> 52:29.543
<i>Tonight at 10:00pm,</i>

52:30.293 --> 52:35.126
<i>on board the 'Megaride', the Ace
of Clubs Hall. You're all invited.</i>

52:40.126 --> 52:41.626
Do you like how I've set you up?

52:43.835 --> 52:46.210
Why did you turn away?

52:46.793 --> 52:48.835
Do you want me to leave?

52:50.460 --> 52:52.751
This dress looks so good on you,
doesn't it?

52:54.543 --> 52:56.501
Here, let me have your foot.

52:58.168 --> 53:01.085
Don't worry if it's dirty,
I don't care.

53:02.001 --> 53:04.460
It doesn't take much
for me to know a foot,

53:05.001 --> 53:07.043
to understand what it desires.

53:08.251 --> 53:10.168
Do you like shoes, little one?

53:10.543 --> 53:13.835
I'll prepare the most beautiful shoes
for you that have ever been seen.

53:14.043 --> 53:17.668
Your wedding gown will be the envy
of every bride in the world,

53:17.918 --> 53:19.710
and then you'll live
in a dream palace

53:19.918 --> 53:23.543
with a hundred people at your
service, to grant your every wish.

53:23.835 --> 53:25.585
You just have to say yes.

53:27.918 --> 53:30.918
Not now, at a quarter to midnight

53:31.085 --> 53:33.376
my men will come get you
and bring you on stage.

53:33.668 --> 53:35.418
And you'll say it
in front of everyone.

53:35.626 --> 53:38.168
It's fine if you only nod yes.

53:39.085 --> 53:41.335
Do you think you can do it?

53:41.585 --> 53:42.543
Yes?

53:44.085 --> 53:46.376
You're a good girl.

53:47.293 --> 53:50.126
I'll make you the happiest woman
in the world.

54:15.460 --> 54:17.376
<i>It's not just a game.</i>

54:17.585 --> 54:20.210
<i>These holograms are our testament.</i>

54:20.418 --> 54:22.126
<i>I know that many prefer to forget,</i>

54:22.335 --> 54:27.335
<i>you too say you want to leave
what you were behind you,</i>

54:27.543 --> 54:32.210
<i>but you see, Angelica, we're only
the first part of the story.</i>

54:33.001 --> 54:35.418
<i>The best is yet to come.</i>

54:36.210 --> 54:38.418
Mama, the shoes have arrived!

54:38.626 --> 54:41.293
The errand boy
left them in the private room.

54:41.460 --> 54:44.793
He said they're gorgeous!
Come, quickly!

54:46.418 --> 54:48.418
What you refuse to understand

54:48.668 --> 54:53.001
is we're not talking small stuff,
there are huge interests at stake,

54:53.168 --> 54:55.376
pressure from above.

54:55.585 --> 54:57.793
Did you ask yourself
how they knew about the mole?

54:58.043 --> 54:59.876
You mean they're not going
to give us the warrant?

55:00.126 --> 55:03.251
Who the fuck is he? How did
he get out of the ship alive?

55:03.835 --> 55:06.501
And when were you going to tell me
about the warrant?

55:06.710 --> 55:09.793
After the police take a photo
with the cake and the bride?

55:10.001 --> 55:13.376
The warrant will be here any minute,
you mustn't be under any illusions.

55:13.585 --> 55:16.501
Above all it's a police operation,

55:16.710 --> 55:19.751
there mustn't be any personal issues
in the way, got it?

55:19.960 --> 55:24.043
You better spill his name now,
name and surname!

55:24.501 --> 55:25.918
Confidential information, my ass!

55:26.168 --> 55:27.876
If nobody took things personally,

55:28.085 --> 55:30.710
the world would go to the dogs!

55:30.960 --> 55:32.751
The bastard boarded my ship!

55:33.085 --> 55:36.585
As sure as my name's Lo Giusto
if you don't tell me his name...

55:37.210 --> 55:39.835
Primo Gemito! Go on, write it down:

55:40.043 --> 55:40.876
Primo Gemito!

55:41.043 --> 55:42.168
It took you long enough.

55:42.335 --> 55:44.418
It's just a fucking name.

55:45.751 --> 55:47.460
And what a stupid fucking name it is!

55:48.210 --> 55:53.126
I don't know about his name,
but his surname, if I may,

55:53.335 --> 55:55.626
sounds pretty important indeed.

55:55.835 --> 55:58.043
I want to direct
the operations in there.

55:58.293 --> 56:00.376
Do you realize what they've done
to that little girl?

56:00.585 --> 56:03.793
Little girl? She's 17.

56:04.001 --> 56:05.293
Actually... 18.

56:05.501 --> 56:06.293
What?

56:06.501 --> 56:07.793
- Cozza!
- Yes?

56:08.001 --> 56:10.376
I asked you if there weren't
any other solutions.

56:10.585 --> 56:13.001
- To what, may I ask?
- To Angelica.

56:13.210 --> 56:15.418
If I really had to marry her.

56:15.626 --> 56:18.710
- Well?
- I've found another solution.

56:19.001 --> 56:20.376
I'll marry the little girl.

56:20.585 --> 56:24.001
Tomorrow is her birthday,
it's written in the file.

56:24.251 --> 56:25.543
Now I get it!

56:26.793 --> 56:29.085
- Which little girl?
- Basile's daughter.

56:29.293 --> 56:32.710
I'll marry her and I don't need
to ask Angelica anything, agreed?

56:33.293 --> 56:36.793
He came back to marry the girl,
not Mrs. Carannante.

56:37.001 --> 56:40.210
The contract for the reconstruction
of the port, Basile's will...

56:40.418 --> 56:42.835
They waited until the child
was able to sign it,

56:43.043 --> 56:45.043
they planned it all 15 years ago.

56:45.251 --> 56:47.876
Those bastards had already
thought of everything.

56:48.085 --> 56:52.418
This is something new
that I never would have thought of.

56:52.918 --> 56:54.501
Well can we?

56:55.418 --> 56:58.251
Technically, it's a brilliant move,

56:58.460 --> 57:01.293
like the great chess player
and improviser,

57:01.501 --> 57:04.001
which you are, but...

57:04.210 --> 57:06.043
But what?

57:06.251 --> 57:09.085
I'm still rooting for Lady Angelica,

57:09.293 --> 57:11.210
if I were you, I'd think twice.

57:11.751 --> 57:15.835
If I were you I'd think about
getting the right paperwork ready.

57:16.043 --> 57:18.335
- I don't want any more surprises.
- Of course.

57:18.585 --> 57:20.793
<i>The King's wedding!</i>

57:21.001 --> 57:25.210
<i>This evening, at 10:00pm,
on board the 'Megaride',</i>

57:25.418 --> 57:27.626
<i>in the Ace of Clubs Hall.</i>

57:27.835 --> 57:29.335
<i>You're all invited!</i>

57:40.210 --> 57:41.710
- Hello?
- <i>Primo Gemito?</i>

57:41.918 --> 57:43.835
- Yes.
- <i>It's Salvatore.</i>

57:44.043 --> 57:46.460
- Salvatore who?
- Salvatore Lo Giusto.

57:46.668 --> 57:49.668
But call me "sir", I prefer it.

57:49.918 --> 57:54.335
Salvatore Lo Giusto, I'm on my way
over, I'm going to ruin your party.

57:55.168 --> 57:57.460
Indeed, they told me
you did everything you could

57:57.668 --> 58:00.001
<i>to attend,
but if you'd told me sooner,</i>

58:00.168 --> 58:02.793
I would have invited you myself.

58:03.001 --> 58:05.293
<i>But I've already got an invite.</i>

58:05.501 --> 58:07.710
And only I know the name
and age of the bride.

58:07.960 --> 58:09.960
- What?
- <i>You heard me.</i>

58:10.168 --> 58:12.668
You're getting a bit too cocky.

58:12.835 --> 58:14.335
Listen to me, Primo Gemito,

58:14.585 --> 58:17.918
<i>Salvatore Lo Giusto
warns once then shoots.</i>

58:18.168 --> 58:19.835
Know what your name means, Primo?

58:20.085 --> 58:21.460
It means "first"

58:21.751 --> 58:23.001
'cause you're the first asshole,

58:23.293 --> 58:27.460
and the first to board my ship with
no ticket and to take a trip to hell!

58:27.751 --> 58:30.751
My name's Primo because
my parents wanted a numerous family

58:30.918 --> 58:32.251
but then they died young.

58:32.876 --> 58:35.835
You're calling to threaten to kill
me, to frighten me.

58:36.710 --> 58:40.168
But I died 15 years ago, together
with that ship and this city.

58:40.668 --> 58:43.043
Now it's just a ghost story.

58:45.168 --> 58:47.460
Listen to this asshole!

58:47.751 --> 58:52.001
What are you two looking at?
Have you emptied the hold yet?

58:52.710 --> 58:56.168
- Mama, they're gorgeous!
- Just perfect!

58:56.460 --> 58:59.543
- They're too small for me.
- No shit, you've got huge feet.

58:59.835 --> 59:02.835
Hurry, hurry! Bring them to me.

59:17.918 --> 59:19.751
- I don't get it...
- They're too small.

59:20.085 --> 59:22.210
No way, there must be a mistake.

59:22.460 --> 59:24.251
They're too small!

59:24.501 --> 59:25.793
Maybe slightly.

59:26.001 --> 59:30.085
Mama, maybe he didn't remember
your size, we'll change them.

59:30.293 --> 59:32.710
Put them back on the pedestal.

01:00:03.626 --> 01:00:07.460
Miss, please excuse the intrusion,
I'm Mr. Cozza

01:00:07.668 --> 01:00:12.376
and these magnificent Valkyries
here present are our stylists.

01:00:13.418 --> 01:00:16.043
God forbid, you're already
beautiful as you are,

01:00:16.251 --> 01:00:20.876
but the King, as you will be aware,
takes care of the slightest detail.

01:00:34.793 --> 01:00:36.793
God, I'm so handsome.

01:00:37.126 --> 01:00:39.251
Do we know what happened
with the shoes?

01:00:39.501 --> 01:00:41.960
What's to know?
They got the wrong size,

01:00:42.251 --> 01:00:44.168
who knows
if they'll change them in time.

01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:47.543
It sure is strange.
Doesn't something smell fishy?

01:00:47.876 --> 01:00:50.168
Maybe go for a wash then, Barbara!

01:00:57.210 --> 01:01:01.793
Look what the cat dragged in! You're
lucky you got out alive, scumbag!

01:01:02.085 --> 01:01:04.168
You're insulting a public official,
dickhead.

01:01:04.418 --> 01:01:05.918
Cuff him.

01:01:06.210 --> 01:01:09.585
Scumbag! Cesspool! Piece of shit!

01:01:09.918 --> 01:01:14.460
When my wife got to the altar,
they had to convince me it was her,

01:01:14.751 --> 01:01:18.585
because, well, she's never been ugly,
mercy me, no,

01:01:18.793 --> 01:01:20.793
but she's not exactly a model.

01:01:24.626 --> 01:01:27.085
Angelica, what are you doing here?

01:01:27.376 --> 01:01:30.126
I've been stuck here for 15 years
and I don't even know why anymore.

01:01:30.418 --> 01:01:31.710
What did you come back for?

01:01:39.251 --> 01:01:42.293
What are you talking about?
Get ready, it's nearly time.

01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:46.001
I am ready, I have been for 20 years.

01:01:46.293 --> 01:01:48.918
And you?
What's going through your head?

01:01:49.210 --> 01:01:51.043
A bit of brilliantine.

01:01:51.335 --> 01:01:55.168
Salvatore wanted you to be alone
when you opened his gift.

01:01:56.085 --> 01:01:59.085
But bear in mind
that in a few minutes

01:01:59.293 --> 01:02:03.126
the two gentlemen outside
will accompany you on stage.

01:02:03.335 --> 01:02:05.168
May I?

01:02:06.251 --> 01:02:08.543
Get ready for the party
and stop worrying,

01:02:08.876 --> 01:02:12.043
Salvatore Lo Giusto has never and
will never let you want for anything.

01:02:12.335 --> 01:02:16.251
Salvatore! You've only ever
tasted my sweet side.

01:02:16.793 --> 01:02:19.376
You can't even imagine
what I'm capable of.

01:02:21.793 --> 01:02:25.210
I'm in,
I'm heading for the bridge.

01:02:25.876 --> 01:02:30.793
We can finally go from safeguarding
the inheritance, to transferring it.

01:02:31.293 --> 01:02:34.501
Then we can only hope
the girl doesn't play any tricks.

01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:38.376
She's too busy with her new wardrobe,
she doesn't have time for pranks.

01:02:44.668 --> 01:02:47.751
In fact...
Go give her a hand, you never know.

01:02:48.001 --> 01:02:50.001
And when it's time,
bring the little one to me on stage.

01:02:50.251 --> 01:02:53.793
- Three of us for a small girl?
- She's not the problem, dickhead.

01:02:54.335 --> 01:02:55.501
Move!

01:02:57.543 --> 01:02:59.001
Mama, what's wrong?

01:03:07.126 --> 01:03:09.585
The King wants to marry the Cat.

01:03:10.376 --> 01:03:12.335
If you love your Mama,

01:03:12.835 --> 01:03:14.751
the Cat must die now.

01:03:16.418 --> 01:03:18.335
Go back to your room, Mama.

01:03:19.335 --> 01:03:23.418
I swear that I'll bring you
the cat's head... and tail too!

01:03:58.918 --> 01:04:01.126
You needn't put on a clean suit.

01:04:01.335 --> 01:04:03.168
Salvatore, it's you.

01:04:03.376 --> 01:04:06.376
You want to give me a heart attack
on my wedding day?

01:04:06.585 --> 01:04:10.876
I still haven't congratulated you
on Angelica's shoes,

01:04:11.085 --> 01:04:13.085
a masterpiece, truly,

01:04:13.293 --> 01:04:15.293
I'll have to repay you somehow.

01:04:15.501 --> 01:04:19.126
Our problem isn't repayments,
but everything we've got in common:

01:04:19.335 --> 01:04:22.918
born in the same neighborhood
with big plans for this port

01:04:23.876 --> 01:04:26.293
and we fuck the same woman.

01:04:26.543 --> 01:04:27.835
Are you mad?

01:04:28.043 --> 01:04:31.460
No, the mad scientist is you.

01:04:31.668 --> 01:04:34.418
You'd have done better not to come
back, this city's not for you.

01:04:34.626 --> 01:04:38.585
Salvatore, put the gun down,
I'm asking you like a father.

01:04:39.418 --> 01:04:43.418
- You're aiming it at the wrong man.
- Oh, please, you'll make me cry.

01:04:43.626 --> 01:04:46.668
I'm giving my soul to this city,
I've got big plans for all of us,

01:04:46.918 --> 01:04:48.293
for you too.

01:04:48.501 --> 01:04:51.168
The city is like a beautiful woman

01:04:51.835 --> 01:04:54.751
and a good plan is like
a good pair of shoes.

01:04:55.418 --> 01:04:58.918
It's not enough for it to be
beautiful, it has to be custom-made,

01:04:59.126 --> 01:05:02.751
follow the shape of the foot,
it has to be comfortable.

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:05.793
And if it fits properly,
rest assured, you can control

01:05:06.001 --> 01:05:09.001
the woman even from a distance.

01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:12.835
But don't worry yourself,
Don Vittorio,

01:05:13.043 --> 01:05:15.918
you see, I'm the only one to pull
the shoe strings around here.

01:05:26.418 --> 01:05:27.835
Mia!

01:05:30.668 --> 01:05:32.835
Is everything all right, miss?

01:05:33.835 --> 01:05:36.460
Miss, is everything all right?

01:05:39.251 --> 01:05:40.751
What do we do?

01:05:41.626 --> 01:05:42.835
Miss!

01:05:43.168 --> 01:05:44.210
Let's break the door down!

01:05:45.085 --> 01:05:48.210
- We're breaking the door down.
- Stay clear, miss.

01:05:49.543 --> 01:05:52.918
Where the fuck is she?
Check the bedroom, I'll go this way.

01:05:58.418 --> 01:06:00.168
No, he's not here yet,

01:06:00.335 --> 01:06:03.210
any minute now though,
the room's almost full.

01:06:16.168 --> 01:06:19.168
Calm down, gentlemen,
there's room for everyone.

01:06:19.835 --> 01:06:22.668
Primo Gemito, please, come in.

01:06:23.251 --> 01:06:25.293
Would you like to come down with us?

01:06:25.543 --> 01:06:27.168
I could never go so low.

01:06:28.293 --> 01:06:29.710
Really?

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:32.668
And yet, you were seen splashing
around the hold last night.

01:06:33.251 --> 01:06:36.835
True, but there was a time when even
the hold was an hospitable place.

01:06:38.376 --> 01:06:40.793
Listen to me, Mr. Gemito,

01:06:41.001 --> 01:06:43.626
you're too attached to the past,

01:06:43.835 --> 01:06:46.835
if you go on like this, very soon,

01:06:47.043 --> 01:06:50.251
all that will be left of you will be
a faded, old hologram.

01:06:57.001 --> 01:06:58.585
There she is, the little bitch.

01:07:00.626 --> 01:07:02.460
Where are you going, you bitch?

01:07:04.335 --> 01:07:05.418
I'm gonna kill you.

01:07:05.585 --> 01:07:06.751
We'll see if that teaches you.

01:07:09.668 --> 01:07:11.418
The girl's coming with me.

01:07:11.585 --> 01:07:14.085
My Barbarella!

01:07:40.626 --> 01:07:45.626
One of the most important pages
of my life is about to be written...

01:07:46.418 --> 01:07:50.626
but also about this ship,
this port and this city.

01:07:50.835 --> 01:07:54.543
You need to know that marriage
is not just an act of love.

01:07:54.751 --> 01:07:55.835
No, no, no!

01:07:56.043 --> 01:07:58.460
It's a contract, it's serious.

01:07:58.668 --> 01:08:00.168
Of course...

01:08:00.376 --> 01:08:02.585
sometimes,
it's like a bill of exchange.

01:08:02.793 --> 01:08:07.210
But I figured this out
some time back:

01:08:07.418 --> 01:08:12.418
marriage is the only true instrument
of social revolution.

01:08:14.543 --> 01:08:17.167
Mama, they had guns,

01:08:17.792 --> 01:08:19.542
they took us by surprise.

01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:24.376
Kill the Cat,

01:08:25.126 --> 01:08:27.042
she's been nothing but a curse on us,

01:08:29.001 --> 01:08:31.210
she's brought us nothing but trouble.

01:08:32.710 --> 01:08:34.085
Mama...

01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:36.292
You kill her.

01:08:44.501 --> 01:08:46.501
Keep away.

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:53.960
I've waited 15 years
for this day to come.

01:08:54.167 --> 01:08:55.792
Look.

01:08:56.001 --> 01:08:57.626
Look!

01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:03.001
You were supposed to be here, in
their place, that's what I'd decided.

01:09:03.585 --> 01:09:05.501
And I was supposed
to be in your shoes.

01:09:05.710 --> 01:09:08.710
That's how it was supposed to be,
it was all arranged.

01:09:09.917 --> 01:09:13.085
I found a rich, cultured,
intelligent man

01:09:13.292 --> 01:09:15.126
who loved me.

01:09:17.126 --> 01:09:19.042
But I wanted the King!

01:09:19.335 --> 01:09:20.960
And the King wanted me.

01:09:21.126 --> 01:09:23.835
And so I did everything
I was supposed to do.

01:09:24.042 --> 01:09:25.667
I was impeccable,

01:09:25.917 --> 01:09:29.001
15 years, 15, always impeccable.

01:09:31.001 --> 01:09:32.835
But I got one thing wrong...

01:09:33.167 --> 01:09:35.210
I made your father's same mistake.

01:09:36.835 --> 01:09:38.667
I gave my trust.

01:09:39.126 --> 01:09:41.417
And now it's all over, little one.

01:09:42.417 --> 01:09:46.042
You're only guilty of one thing:
you stayed here.

01:09:48.126 --> 01:09:50.835
This ship has to disappear forever.

01:09:51.042 --> 01:09:53.917
Now I'm going to go down
to the fuel room

01:09:54.085 --> 01:09:56.960
and I'm going to blow everything up,

01:09:57.168 --> 01:10:00.210
because I've decided nobody
here is to be saved.

01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:04.668
But you need to do
one last thing for me.

01:10:05.418 --> 01:10:06.835
Do you feel up to it?

01:10:08.793 --> 01:10:11.793
There's a blackbird in my room,

01:10:12.001 --> 01:10:15.626
your father gave it to me
thinking I'd like it.

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:19.293
But how could the poor man know
anything about me?

01:10:20.168 --> 01:10:23.293
I kept the blackbird all these years
only because it stopped singing,

01:10:24.126 --> 01:10:26.460
that's the only reason
I didn't kill it.

01:10:26.668 --> 01:10:28.585
But now...

01:10:29.835 --> 01:10:31.960
Life's so strange...

01:10:32.418 --> 01:10:34.210
now I want it to be
the only one to survive.

01:10:34.418 --> 01:10:36.335
But it needs to fly far away,

01:10:36.626 --> 01:10:39.918
it mustn't set foot back
in this shithole of a city.

01:10:42.626 --> 01:10:43.626
Bye, little one.

01:10:56.293 --> 01:11:00.918
Calm down, we'll see in midnight
with a piece written by the Shaman,

01:11:01.126 --> 01:11:03.085
it's called "Bad Grass".

01:11:03.251 --> 01:11:06.168
But I've made it mine
because I'm the King.

01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:08.751
Go, Shaman!

01:11:08.918 --> 01:11:10.293
The Shaman is therapeutic.

01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:22.585
<i>I'm the foulest of weeds</i>

01:11:23.085 --> 01:11:25.460
<i>Rest assured, you can't kill me</i>

01:11:25.751 --> 01:11:30.335
<i>I was born clean, I swear it
but you'd rather not listen.</i>

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:33.751
<i>I'm a filthy weed</i>

01:11:34.126 --> 01:11:35.626
<i>Good luck trying to kill me.</i>

01:11:35.793 --> 01:11:36.501
Mr. Basile...

01:11:36.668 --> 01:11:41.085
<i>Forever waiting for a falling leaf
to drift by and visit me</i>

01:11:41.751 --> 01:11:43.918
<i>My ears are sewn shut</i>

01:11:44.751 --> 01:11:46.668
<i>I've no eyes, I've no mouth</i>

01:11:47.376 --> 01:11:51.876
<i>But the inner workings of people's
minds are no secret to me</i>

01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:54.460
<i>My ears are sewn shut</i>

01:11:54.751 --> 01:11:57.751
<i>I don't see, I won't tell</i>

01:11:58.126 --> 01:12:01.876
<i>But I've grasped the thoughts
of the people of the world</i>

01:12:03.126 --> 01:12:05.043
<i>I rely on myself</i>

01:12:05.710 --> 01:12:07.626
<i>I'm nothing but crabgrass</i>

01:12:08.293 --> 01:12:12.460
<i>I'm stuck to this wall, rigid with
fear and I can't even scream</i>

01:12:13.501 --> 01:12:16.293
<i>I long for a storm</i>

01:12:16.543 --> 01:12:18.751
<i>to blow me away</i>

01:12:19.085 --> 01:12:23.585
<i>to blow me away to a far away place
then I'll finally breathe</i>

01:12:24.376 --> 01:12:26.668
<i>My ears are sewn shut</i>

01:12:27.668 --> 01:12:29.585
<i>I've no eyes and no mouth</i>

01:12:30.585 --> 01:12:33.960
<i>But the inner workings
of people's minds are no secret to me</i>

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:37.460
<i>My ears are sewn shut</i>

01:12:37.751 --> 01:12:40.335
<i>I don't see, I won't tell</i>

01:12:40.585 --> 01:12:44.501
<i>But I've grasped the thoughts
of the people of the world</i>

01:12:45.126 --> 01:12:47.501
We're here but the hatch is stuck.

01:12:54.793 --> 01:12:56.085
Let's try from the other side.

01:13:06.501 --> 01:13:08.626
My ears are sewn shut

01:13:09.293 --> 01:13:10.793
<i>I don't see, I won't tell</i>

01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:15.876
<i>But the inner workings of people's
minds are no secret to me</i>

01:13:17.085 --> 01:13:19.460
<i>My ears are sewn shut</i>

01:13:19.751 --> 01:13:22.001
<i>I don't see, I won't tell</i>

01:13:22.293 --> 01:13:26.210
<i>But I've grasped the thoughts
of the people of the world</i>

01:13:26.835 --> 01:13:30.376
There aren't any bodies, down there
they've cleaned everything up.

01:13:30.585 --> 01:13:32.376
<i>I'm the foulest of weeds,
Can't be rid of me easy</i>

01:13:32.668 --> 01:13:35.793
<i>I was born clean, I swear
but you'd rather not listen.</i>

01:13:36.585 --> 01:13:38.876
I've managed to activate it,
I'm looking for the girl.

01:13:39.918 --> 01:13:42.335
<i>Can't be rid of me easy</i>

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:46.501
<i>Forever waiting for a falling leaf
to drift by and visit me</i>

01:13:46.668 --> 01:13:50.460
It's all about to blow up, they're
laying waste to the fuel area!

01:13:50.668 --> 01:13:52.293
Evacuate the ship, immediately!

01:13:52.793 --> 01:13:54.626
How the fuck does this thing turn on?

01:13:55.835 --> 01:14:00.043
<i>Red alert! All passengers
are to leave the ship at once!</i>

01:14:00.251 --> 01:14:01.960
<i>There's a fire in the fuel room.</i>

01:14:04.751 --> 01:14:07.460
Stay calm, stay calm!

01:14:07.668 --> 01:14:11.793
It's just some cop who's got it
into his head to ruin my party,

01:14:12.001 --> 01:14:13.751
but he's a nobody!

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:16.626
He's a guy who likes to play pranks.

01:14:16.835 --> 01:14:20.043
Where the fuck are you going?
Where the fuck are you going?

01:14:20.251 --> 01:14:24.460
Sit down!
Sit down! Sit down!

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:31.668
<i>And if I pause for a beat
and I can almost picture</i>

01:14:31.918 --> 01:14:34.376
<i>a way to reinvent the world</i>

01:14:36.126 --> 01:14:39.210
<i>that's more serene, more cheerful,
more authentic</i>

01:14:39.793 --> 01:14:42.376
<i>though by no means free from harm.</i>

01:14:42.793 --> 01:14:44.335
What's "I can't find her" mean?

01:14:44.543 --> 01:14:47.835
I don't give a fuck about the ship,
you've got to find the girl!

01:14:52.710 --> 01:14:54.210
I found her! I found the girl!

01:14:54.918 --> 01:14:57.126
I'm going to get her
from the east wing.

01:14:57.335 --> 01:15:01.168
Where the fuck are those idiots
who were supposed to bring her to me?

01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:07.960
And now let the real party begin!

01:15:10.126 --> 01:15:11.710
Inspector, I'm abandoning ship.

01:15:11.876 --> 01:15:13.418
We're going down like the Titanic!

01:15:13.668 --> 01:15:16.293
<i>Someplace, somewhere,
we'll say farewell</i>

01:15:16.501 --> 01:15:18.793
<i>Someplace, elsewhere, on me
you'll dwell</i>

01:15:19.001 --> 01:15:21.418
<i>Without love, push forwards
just the same</i>

01:15:21.626 --> 01:15:25.251
<i>but bring me back immediately
but bring me immediately</i>

01:15:25.501 --> 01:15:29.210
<i>to where we left off
Where were we, where?</i>

01:15:39.335 --> 01:15:44.168
<i>I drift between
the beginning and the end</i>

01:15:44.418 --> 01:15:48.251
<i>over the wharves
at the edge of the world</i>

01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:52.460
<i>where we used to sit and gaze</i>

01:15:52.668 --> 01:15:54.335
<i>at our lives as they slipped by...</i>

01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:01.335
Mezzarecchia, if you leave
before you find her,

01:16:01.543 --> 01:16:03.543
I swear by my own name...

01:16:05.501 --> 01:16:06.835
Little one...

01:16:08.210 --> 01:16:10.210
where were you?

01:16:10.418 --> 01:16:12.418
I was worried about you.

01:16:13.501 --> 01:16:16.501
Everything's about to blow up
thanks to that madman.

01:16:17.335 --> 01:16:19.418
What are you doing with that gun?

01:16:20.335 --> 01:16:22.626
And where are your shoes?

01:16:26.668 --> 01:16:28.251
What's this supposed to mean?

01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:31.376
You wanna play games
with this shitstorm going on?

01:16:31.668 --> 01:16:35.168
<i>Without love, we push forward just
the same and so, take me back now</i>

01:16:36.043 --> 01:16:38.918
<i>Bring me to where we were</i>

01:16:39.168 --> 01:16:40.918
<i>Where were you when all was black</i>

01:16:41.085 --> 01:16:43.293
<i>As I lit another candle
to the Virgin Mary?</i>

01:16:43.501 --> 01:16:45.918
<i>Without love, we push forwards
just the same...</i>

01:16:47.126 --> 01:16:49.335
It's all over, we gotta go.

01:16:49.501 --> 01:16:53.418
So tell me now, tell me where are we?
We're onboard a ship, sailing faraway

01:16:53.626 --> 01:16:58.293
But without love, where can we go
where can we go, where?
