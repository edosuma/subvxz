WEBVTT

00:03.667 --> 00:06.167
See you later,
you dirty commies.

00:07.833 --> 00:08.967
Morning.

00:09.033 --> 00:11.533
Mom, there's a man
in my swing set!

00:11.600 --> 00:14.300
Oh, Cole, I was just
coming to see you.

00:14.367 --> 00:15.800
I don't know what to do, Mama.

00:15.867 --> 00:18.500
I talked to her daddy,
he said it's all right.

00:18.567 --> 00:19.967
It ain't her
daddy whose heart

00:20.033 --> 00:21.567
you're trying to win.

00:21.633 --> 00:25.033
Screwing your second
job's boss part of helping me?

00:25.100 --> 00:27.133
Well, I suppose it's my fault

00:27.200 --> 00:28.567
for setting a precedent.

00:34.900 --> 00:37.533
FCC investigation, my ass!

00:37.600 --> 00:39.367
Miss a flick of the
on-air switch

00:39.433 --> 00:42.133
and one damn
cuss word shoots out.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.033
Mr. Big Shot
station manager gonna

00:44.100 --> 00:45.967
rain on my parade.

00:46.033 --> 00:48.533
Well, how 'bout I rain on his?

01:00.067 --> 01:02.900
Well,
what have we here?

01:02.967 --> 01:04.233
Whoo!

01:04.300 --> 01:05.700
Let's go, Badger.

01:07.367 --> 01:08.967
G'on now, Badger.

01:09.067 --> 01:10.233
Give 'em what's what!

01:12.867 --> 01:14.300
-Whoo!

01:15.433 --> 01:16.667
Hate to break
it to ya, fellas,

01:16.733 --> 01:18.267
but chances of baggin'
a buck up

01:18.333 --> 01:20.833
on that there rooftop
is mighty slim.

01:21.967 --> 01:23.233
Hey, now don't you worry,

01:23.300 --> 01:24.800
we find the guy
who runs this place,

01:24.867 --> 01:26.433
we're gonna mount his head on
my wall.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.833
Yeah. I'll pose
for a photo with it, boy.

01:30.367 --> 01:32.733
Looks like I found
kindred spirits.

01:32.800 --> 01:34.100
Aye, what's your beef?

01:34.167 --> 01:36.367
Eeh-jit station manager.

01:38.567 --> 01:40.233
-Whoo!

01:40.300 --> 01:41.500
You work here?

01:42.433 --> 01:44.600
Yes, sir, yes, sir,

01:44.667 --> 01:47.233
good people! It's red, hot
'n blue

01:47.300 --> 01:49.833
comin' at you from WHBQ.

01:50.900 --> 01:52.733
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.

01:52.800 --> 01:53.900
Is you Dewey Phillips?

01:57.067 --> 01:58.300
You're white!

02:00.900 --> 02:02.300
-Hell!

02:02.367 --> 02:03.567
Get over here.

02:10.233 --> 02:12.233
You get our
daughters all frocked up

02:12.300 --> 02:14.233
with that jungle music.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.067
Come on,
let's get out of here.

03:10.067 --> 03:11.067
Mmm!

03:13.567 --> 03:15.833
Hey, Jimmy,
heck of a day for it.

03:18.800 --> 03:19.967
Peggy May,

03:20.067 --> 03:22.067
I'm gonna need your help
over here, honey.

03:27.467 --> 03:30.067
How's the single life
treatin' ya, cuz?

03:30.100 --> 03:31.100
Fine, thank you.

03:31.167 --> 03:32.433
You know what you need, Jimmy?

03:32.500 --> 03:33.700
A sign from the Lord,

03:33.767 --> 03:35.533
like you gettin'
hit by a train?

03:35.600 --> 03:37.467
Well, don't be such
a sore loser, now.

03:37.533 --> 03:38.633
You just need a gal
a your own, that's all.

03:38.700 --> 03:39.933
How 'bout I set you up,

03:40.067 --> 03:41.600
we can double date?

03:41.667 --> 03:43.233
You just take a
gander at all these fine

03:43.300 --> 03:44.767
available girls right here.

03:44.833 --> 03:47.433
Like, uh, like
Shaney Hollister?

03:48.233 --> 03:49.500
I mean, now, I'll admit

03:49.567 --> 03:51.100
she ain't gonna win
no beauty contests,

03:51.167 --> 03:53.400
but I hear she makes a heck
of a sweet 'tater casserole,

03:53.467 --> 03:54.600
you know what I'm saying?

03:54.667 --> 03:55.800
-Jerry, go away.
-You don't like her?

03:55.867 --> 03:57.567
How about
Mary Boon over there?

03:57.633 --> 04:00.400
Now, I could picture the two
a you in blissful union.

04:00.467 --> 04:02.567
Course, you might wanna
be on top in said union,

04:02.633 --> 04:04.433
you know, get a
chance to breathe.

04:04.500 --> 04:05.500
That's it!

04:05.567 --> 04:06.700
-No, I've had...
-Jimmy!

04:06.767 --> 04:08.400
-No!
-Did I hit a nerve?

04:08.467 --> 04:10.067
No...

04:10.133 --> 04:11.767
I said shut up!

04:12.967 --> 04:15.433
Jimmy, this is a
peaceful event.

04:19.067 --> 04:22.600
Stop it! You two acting like a
couple of polecats in heat!

04:29.167 --> 04:32.300
Are you sure you want
to do this? It's not too late.

04:32.367 --> 04:34.067
You don't have to do this.

04:42.900 --> 04:45.200
Sam, Sam, it's okay.
You're okay.

04:45.267 --> 04:46.567
You're in the hospital!

04:46.633 --> 04:49.933
Hey! Leave us alone!
Leave us alone!

04:51.767 --> 04:52.767
Hey...

04:53.467 --> 04:54.833
It's okay.

04:56.767 --> 04:59.233
Come on, lay down. It's okay.

04:59.300 --> 05:00.500
I wanna go.

05:00.567 --> 05:01.767
I know.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.700
Lay down.

05:04.767 --> 05:06.233
Sam, lay back down.

05:07.967 --> 05:11.533
The doctor says that you have
to stay here to recover.

05:12.833 --> 05:14.200
Come on, lay back down.

05:31.300 --> 05:32.633
This studio...

05:33.400 --> 05:34.600
Sam,

05:36.967 --> 05:39.067
I know how much you put
into it, but it's what

05:39.133 --> 05:40.633
ended you up in here.

05:42.667 --> 05:43.867
Oh, Becky,

05:44.967 --> 05:46.167
it's okay.

05:46.233 --> 05:47.767
No, it's not, Sam.

05:47.833 --> 05:50.067
-It's not. It's not okay.
-It's okay.

05:51.467 --> 05:53.067
It's killing you.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.967
And we're not having
any more of it.

06:00.267 --> 06:02.067
I spoke to Cousin Jim

06:02.833 --> 06:05.600
and he's got an opening

06:05.667 --> 06:07.400
for the morning drive time

06:07.467 --> 06:09.067
at his station.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.700
I'm gonna be on the air?

06:11.767 --> 06:13.133
Yeah, back on the air.

06:19.700 --> 06:20.900
Oh, gosh.

06:22.967 --> 06:25.533
I've got to pick Knox
up from school.

06:32.700 --> 06:34.967
I'll let Sam tell you
the good news.

06:38.667 --> 06:40.100
Bye.
Bye.

06:51.367 --> 06:53.233
Next time you want to
shock your brain,

06:53.300 --> 06:55.967
I will hit you on the head
with a lamp.

06:57.767 --> 06:59.567
What's the good news?

07:01.300 --> 07:02.900
Well, Becky's, uh...

07:06.333 --> 07:07.333
...you know, cousin

07:08.767 --> 07:11.767
is a program director
and, uh...

07:12.567 --> 07:14.167
You... You said yes?

07:15.533 --> 07:16.933
Look, I'm...

07:17.067 --> 07:20.167
Music's not a part
of who you are.

07:21.667 --> 07:23.867
It is who you are.

07:23.933 --> 07:27.367
Playin' someone else's
records ain't gonna cut it.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.200
I found this.

07:34.433 --> 07:35.900
Sun Records.

07:37.300 --> 07:38.633
Your dream.

07:41.433 --> 07:42.767
Our dream.

07:48.433 --> 07:52.067
It begins here for me
here on this road.

07:52.100 --> 07:54.900
How the whole mess happened,
I don't know.

07:54.967 --> 07:57.700
But I know it couldn't happen
again in a million years.

07:58.900 --> 08:01.533
Maybe I coulda
stopped it early.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.833
But once the trouble was
on its way,

08:03.900 --> 08:06.100
-I was just goin' with it.
Hey!

08:06.167 --> 08:08.833
Yeah, well, trouble
is on its way, Elvis!

08:11.833 --> 08:13.233
Get out
of the street, kids!

08:16.800 --> 08:18.833
I knew we should've seen
From Here to Eternity,

08:18.900 --> 08:20.467
'stead of The Wild One.

08:20.533 --> 08:22.900
Now, all I'm gonna be hearin'
about is a bunch a hoodlums.

08:22.967 --> 08:24.100
Oh, he wasn't no hoodlum.

08:24.167 --> 08:25.900
Then what would you call it?

08:25.967 --> 08:27.867
Just a kid tryin'
to break free, I guess.

08:27.933 --> 08:29.700
You're sure we're talkin'
about Marlon Brando

08:29.767 --> 08:31.833
or Elvis Presley?

08:31.900 --> 08:34.500
You know, sometimes
I just don't get you.

08:34.567 --> 08:37.333
What is so bad about
staying right here in Memphis?

08:37.400 --> 08:38.833
Nothing.

08:38.900 --> 08:40.233
I just think there might be
somethin' more excitin'

08:40.300 --> 08:42.700
than the Skyway ballroom
atop the Peabody is all.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.367
We're supposed to be gettin'
your mama a birthday present.

08:50.267 --> 08:51.500
How 'bout a record?

08:51.567 --> 08:53.067
-She likes Hank Snow.

09:00.100 --> 09:01.467
So I figured this way
you could start with

09:01.533 --> 09:03.100
a little bit of Lawrence Welk,

09:03.167 --> 09:04.633
move into some
Andy Williams and

09:04.700 --> 09:08.300
then from there we can...
Oh, my God, who did this?

09:08.367 --> 09:11.067
Can't say we were
properly introduced.

09:11.100 --> 09:13.067
This has gone too far, Dewey.

09:13.100 --> 09:14.700
I'm not just talking
about the FCC.

09:14.767 --> 09:18.133
We're getting complaints from
church groups, from parents...

09:18.200 --> 09:20.067
But not the home office or
they would've canned my ass.

09:20.133 --> 09:21.767
Oh, they still just might.

09:22.833 --> 09:26.333
Dewey, it's just music.

09:27.767 --> 09:28.967
Just music?

09:32.433 --> 09:34.233
Just music?

09:35.700 --> 09:37.333
Look here.

09:37.400 --> 09:38.533
You see that?

09:38.600 --> 09:39.800
Look close.

09:40.700 --> 09:41.900
You see that?

09:42.700 --> 09:44.500
Music's in my blood!

10:04.600 --> 10:06.067
Mornin'.

10:07.467 --> 10:09.800
Feelin' any better?

10:09.867 --> 10:14.800
Well, if better is
like your head

10:14.867 --> 10:18.100
is filled with sand
instead of cement,

10:18.167 --> 10:20.200
well, then, yeah, I guess.

10:30.033 --> 10:31.533
Think about what
it'd look like

10:31.600 --> 10:33.267
with your first hit on it.

10:36.467 --> 10:37.467
Launch a label.

10:38.600 --> 10:39.800
Marion,

10:40.900 --> 10:43.767
you have seen how hard it is

10:43.833 --> 10:45.667
to find new acts, ones

10:45.733 --> 10:48.267
no one's ever heard before.

10:48.333 --> 10:49.767
Unique acts.

10:49.833 --> 10:51.933
Honest. Original.

10:54.367 --> 10:56.000
You know where I can
find an act like that?

10:57.200 --> 10:58.267
I might.

10:59.767 --> 11:01.133
You might?

11:01.933 --> 11:03.400
I might.

11:03.467 --> 11:07.467
Why haven't you mentioned
this act before?

11:07.533 --> 11:10.533
Unique as they are,
there are unique challenges.

11:12.767 --> 11:14.067
Wanna take a look?

11:16.933 --> 11:18.133
Hmm.

11:19.867 --> 11:21.133
I might.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.733
There it is.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.133
The prison?

11:26.200 --> 11:27.900
I told you it was unique.

11:44.433 --> 11:46.900
♪ Start releasin' that chicken

Thank you.

12:38.233 --> 12:40.533
Let's record them.

12:40.600 --> 12:43.733
Were you talkin' to a
different warden than me?

12:43.800 --> 12:46.900
The governor office
seemed most enthusiastic.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.467
His rehabilitation program...

12:48.533 --> 12:51.900
I don't think the warden
got the memo, Marion.

12:51.967 --> 12:53.500
Do you like them?

12:53.567 --> 12:57.233
Maybe, I think so.
Hell, I don't know!

12:57.300 --> 12:59.067
Could you do me a favor, Sam?

12:59.800 --> 13:01.400
What?

13:01.467 --> 13:02.767
Snap out of it.

13:02.833 --> 13:04.800
Find out from Johnny Bragg
what other songs they do

13:04.867 --> 13:06.600
and I'll take care
of the rest.

13:25.367 --> 13:27.300
Now, I've been
doing this a while,

13:28.167 --> 13:29.733
listenin' to people sing

13:31.200 --> 13:32.700
and knowin'

13:35.867 --> 13:37.600
who they are from it.

13:38.667 --> 13:40.067
And, well,

13:41.800 --> 13:43.267
your kinda singin'

13:44.333 --> 13:46.067
don't just come from practice.

13:48.133 --> 13:50.200
Now, to me,

13:50.267 --> 13:51.900
it just don't sound like...

13:51.967 --> 13:53.400
Six counts of rape?

13:56.567 --> 13:59.067
You ever had nothing
but two choices, Mr. Phillips,

13:59.067 --> 14:01.467
and none of 'em good?

14:01.533 --> 14:03.067
You know, I knew
no all-white jury

14:03.067 --> 14:06.167
was ever gonna listen
to anything I had to say, sir.

14:06.233 --> 14:08.567
So I told them
what they wanted to hear.

14:08.633 --> 14:10.833
And just like
the chick in the song,

14:10.900 --> 14:12.733
I was too young to fry.

14:15.133 --> 14:17.200
You know you're never
gettin' out of here.

14:17.267 --> 14:18.767
Except feet first.

14:20.467 --> 14:22.233
And yet

14:22.300 --> 14:24.667
you started this
singing group anyway.

14:26.667 --> 14:28.700
I was 16,

14:28.767 --> 14:30.233
got into a fight.

14:30.300 --> 14:33.533
Man left me for dead
in a Clarksdale alley.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.067
You know, most people,
they say they hear angels.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.567
You know what I heard?

14:39.233 --> 14:40.800
Amazing Grace,

14:40.867 --> 14:43.333
Mahalia Jackson singin' it.

14:49.767 --> 14:52.833
I could be freest,
richest man in the world,

14:52.900 --> 14:54.333
I'd still be singin'.

14:55.167 --> 14:57.067
Couldn't help but not.

14:57.067 --> 14:58.467
That's who I am.

15:17.700 --> 15:19.700
What if Sun Records
wanted to

15:19.767 --> 15:21.067
record The Prisonaires?

15:21.133 --> 15:25.133
Well, unless Mr. Phillips
gets himself convicted,

15:25.200 --> 15:27.400
his time here is over.

15:27.467 --> 15:30.267
I mean, record them
at our studio in Memphis.

15:30.333 --> 15:31.533
I read in
The Commercial Appeal

15:31.600 --> 15:33.467
they sing at
government functions.

15:33.533 --> 15:36.067
But that's just because we've
got a commie

15:36.067 --> 15:37.267
for a governor is why.

15:37.333 --> 15:39.233
Well, it must take
a lot of resources

15:39.300 --> 15:41.700
to take them out to perform.

15:41.767 --> 15:43.300
Uh, yes, ma'am,
it does. It does.

15:43.367 --> 15:45.267
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got plenty...

15:45.333 --> 15:48.367
Perhaps we could help defray
some of those costs.

15:48.433 --> 15:51.067
And in success, a contribution
to the prison fund

15:51.067 --> 15:54.667
for any discretionary expenses
that might arise.

15:58.067 --> 15:59.767
That's a
beautiful lamp, Warden.

16:01.800 --> 16:04.600
Too bad it's not gettin'
the love it deserves.

16:06.533 --> 16:07.967
Crowd was goin' wild for you.

16:08.067 --> 16:10.067
There's no reason you couldn't
be the next Gene Autry.

16:10.133 --> 16:11.433
Yeah?

16:11.500 --> 16:14.200
Television, Hollywood movies?
I like that.

16:14.267 --> 16:18.100
Now, Hollywood's a snake pit.
You're gonna need protection.

16:18.167 --> 16:19.733
Well, good thing
I got me a weasel.

16:21.400 --> 16:24.267
I think you're referrin' to a
mongoose, but that's the idea.

16:27.167 --> 16:29.067
Oh, you got my take?

16:29.067 --> 16:30.167
Uh, the promoter's going to

16:30.233 --> 16:31.400
settle up with us
in the morning.

16:31.467 --> 16:33.067
Okay, so I'll
see you in the a.m.

16:33.067 --> 16:35.233
You got it. Good night.

16:35.300 --> 16:36.467
Clear the bones.
Let's go.

16:36.533 --> 16:38.467
Comin' out. Comin' out, pal.

16:38.533 --> 16:40.800
That's what I'm talking
about right there.

16:40.867 --> 16:42.333
Yeah, right.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.200
All right, let me have them
dice. I'm gonna let it ride.

16:44.267 --> 16:45.600
-Let it ride. All right.
-Sure.

16:45.667 --> 16:48.200
I'm not
afraid. I am not afraid.

16:48.267 --> 16:49.733
Here we go now.
Make a decision.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.900
Everybody's in, everybody's
in. Here we go.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.300
Well, you can't be
right every time.

16:56.367 --> 16:58.233
Can't be right every time.

16:59.867 --> 17:01.267
-Ready?
-All right.

17:01.333 --> 17:02.667
All right, okay, now.

17:02.733 --> 17:04.633
Do something right this time.
Come on, now.

17:04.700 --> 17:07.267
Whoa!
Put her down!

17:07.333 --> 17:08.667
You still in?

17:10.167 --> 17:12.100
I'm standin' here, ain't I?
Come on, get to business.

17:12.167 --> 17:13.433
All right, all right.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.767
Get to business. Come on now.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.933
Smitty, I realize the debt
is now $1,200,

17:17.067 --> 17:20.067
and you will have another
$50 tomorrow as promised.

17:21.367 --> 17:23.300
And I will come after
your sorry ass

17:23.367 --> 17:25.533
for every dime you owe Hank!

17:26.067 --> 17:27.100
Oh, hey!

17:27.167 --> 17:28.967
What are we doing
here, Colonel?

17:29.067 --> 17:30.233
Well...

17:31.533 --> 17:34.500
Hank, what do you see here?

17:34.567 --> 17:36.967
-Records?
-Well, that's not what I see.

17:37.067 --> 17:38.200
Is this a trick question?

17:38.267 --> 17:40.067
Money. I see money.

17:40.067 --> 17:42.800
Money that's goin'
into someone's pocket

17:42.867 --> 17:44.900
and it ain't ours.

17:44.967 --> 17:48.333
You know, most performers
get a good five, six years

17:48.400 --> 17:50.067
before they go cold.
Now that's a fact.

17:51.333 --> 17:53.067
What are you gettin' at?

17:53.067 --> 17:54.533
Imagine,

17:54.600 --> 17:55.833
a management company

17:55.900 --> 17:58.233
with dozens of acts selling
out the Ryman,

17:58.300 --> 18:00.267
merchandise flying
off the shelves,

18:00.333 --> 18:01.767
gold records plastered
everyplace.

18:01.833 --> 18:04.067
A little piece of this,
a little piece of that,

18:04.067 --> 18:05.300
before you know it,

18:05.367 --> 18:07.100
you got yourself an empire.

18:07.167 --> 18:10.667
And I think you might just be
the perfect partner.

18:10.733 --> 18:12.067
How's that work, exactly?

18:12.100 --> 18:13.700
We gotta keep our eye
out for new talent.

18:13.767 --> 18:16.567
We sign 'em, build a business,
split the profits.

18:16.633 --> 18:18.333
You heard of this Fats Domino?

18:18.400 --> 18:20.867
Ooh, Jackie Brenston's
Rocket 88?

18:20.933 --> 18:23.467
It's jungle bop.
I hate that stuff.

18:23.533 --> 18:25.600
You're missing the point, boy.

18:25.667 --> 18:28.067
It ain't about what we like.

18:28.133 --> 18:30.067
It's about what we can sell.

18:31.300 --> 18:33.867
How much is it gonna cost me?

18:33.933 --> 18:37.733
Well, your cut from last night
ought to cover it.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.933
I've gotta make a call.
Think about it.

18:40.067 --> 18:41.600
I don't have to.

18:41.667 --> 18:45.067
-No?
-No. I'm in, partner.

18:46.067 --> 18:47.600
Partners.

18:47.667 --> 18:49.567
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

I talked to Jim.

21:10.833 --> 21:12.533
Erin's been lookin'
at places for us.

21:12.600 --> 21:15.133
She found a house
right down the block.

21:17.800 --> 21:20.200
Are those prison uniforms?

21:20.267 --> 21:21.667
Mmm-hmm.

21:23.700 --> 21:25.967
-Could be our future, Becky.

21:27.100 --> 21:28.933
Convicts?

21:29.067 --> 21:30.133
Yeah.

21:32.600 --> 21:35.533
This was all you, Marion.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.200
He was ready to go.

21:38.733 --> 21:41.333
I thought you were my friend.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.867
-Becks...
-No, Sam.

21:43.933 --> 21:46.900
No, you don't get
to do this to me.

21:46.967 --> 21:50.400
I gave up a life in Nashville
for your dream

21:50.467 --> 21:53.233
and it turned out
to be a nightmare!

21:53.300 --> 21:56.500
Seein' you in that hospital,
I almost came apart!

21:56.567 --> 21:58.467
I can do this.

21:58.533 --> 21:59.867
Becky, I feel it.

22:00.067 --> 22:02.400
Sam, we have got
an offer on the house.

22:02.467 --> 22:05.167
We can be
a normal family again.

22:05.233 --> 22:06.967
This is what I do.

22:08.467 --> 22:12.067
This is what I have to do!

22:14.433 --> 22:17.467
Becky, I will die
in Birmingham.

22:17.533 --> 22:20.067
And I will die here.

Let me give you a hand.

23:10.933 --> 23:12.067
Phew.

23:12.067 --> 23:13.733
You sell the house already?

23:14.667 --> 23:16.333
No.

23:16.400 --> 23:19.067
We didn't sell it,
'cause we're not leaving.

23:19.067 --> 23:20.800
Oh, hold on, let me help you.

23:20.867 --> 23:22.633

Oh, honey,

23:40.267 --> 23:41.633
what's wrong?

23:44.433 --> 23:46.400
Everything was gonna be fine.

23:49.900 --> 23:52.067
Sam makes me so mad.

23:52.067 --> 23:55.067
Oh, honey, I know how that is.

23:55.067 --> 23:59.300
Willie used to make
me so mad, too.

23:59.367 --> 24:02.667
And a day don't go by I don't
wish he were still here

24:02.733 --> 24:04.300
to tick me off.

24:09.467 --> 24:11.667
Dewey sure is his
own worst enemy.

24:12.967 --> 24:14.300
Thank you.

24:15.433 --> 24:17.233
Hear anything from the FCC?

24:17.300 --> 24:18.800
No, I thought it would
blow over, but

24:18.867 --> 24:21.133
The Commercial Appeal
ran a story.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.333
It's not just what he said,

24:22.400 --> 24:23.633
it's everything
that he stands for.

24:23.700 --> 24:25.400
He doesn't
stand for anything

24:25.467 --> 24:26.967
except spinning records.

24:27.067 --> 24:28.467
He's blind to anything else.

24:28.533 --> 24:30.067
That's his problem,
he's color-blind,

24:30.067 --> 24:31.867
which don't sit well with
a lot a folks 'round here.

24:32.867 --> 24:34.133
His job at risk?

24:34.200 --> 24:36.467
I don't rightly know.
I'm doing what I can.

24:37.400 --> 24:39.700
Wouldn't admit it,

24:39.767 --> 24:40.867
but he grows on you.

24:43.433 --> 24:44.700
Hey, say, you hear anything
about that

24:44.767 --> 24:46.767
First Methodist picnic
on Saturday?

24:47.867 --> 24:49.700
Heard somethin' 'bout it.

24:49.767 --> 24:51.100
Do tell.

24:51.167 --> 24:52.433
Matter of fact, was even

24:52.500 --> 24:54.733
thinkin' about contributin'
one of my pies.

24:54.800 --> 24:57.367
Well, perhaps you'd let
me accompany you.

24:57.433 --> 24:59.667
I do love a good pie.

24:59.733 --> 25:01.533
Why, Earle, I'd be more
than happy

25:01.600 --> 25:04.067
to break out my peaches
for you.

25:04.100 --> 25:05.367
Miss Keisker,

25:06.567 --> 25:08.267
you are shameless.

25:09.300 --> 25:10.933
You have no idea.

25:12.267 --> 25:13.467
Now, go on.

25:22.567 --> 25:26.333
Call, and up it a nickel.

25:26.400 --> 25:29.200
-That's 25 cents to you.
Don't have it.

25:29.267 --> 25:30.500
You got a quarter right there!

25:30.567 --> 25:32.533
-Not this one, no way, no how.

25:32.600 --> 25:34.833
Picked it up off a street
in Atlantic City

25:34.900 --> 25:36.667
just as this Olds 88
crashes into the sidewalk

25:36.733 --> 25:38.667
where I was standin' two
seconds before.

25:38.733 --> 25:40.933
Would've been dead
if it wasn't for this coin.

25:41.067 --> 25:42.133
Johnny, get over here.

25:42.200 --> 25:43.600
Come on, possum breath,
it's your turn.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.700
How many times you gonna read
that letter? Jeez.

25:46.833 --> 25:47.667
Hey!

25:47.733 --> 25:49.933
"The day started off fine.

25:50.067 --> 25:51.967
"The bluebonnets
were out just like they did...

25:52.067 --> 25:54.300
"They were the day
we sat in the park.

25:54.367 --> 25:56.200
"Henry came to
give me a ride."

25:56.267 --> 25:58.533
-Henry?
-"But we got a flat tire.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.333
"Lucky Ernie came by."

26:00.400 --> 26:01.500
-Give it.

26:01.567 --> 26:03.300
Henry! Henry!

26:03.367 --> 26:06.067
"Then I twisted my ankle
down by Pine Creek.

26:06.100 --> 26:09.067
"It's a good thing
Dr. Walmer was there."

26:09.133 --> 26:10.767
Dr. Walmer?

26:12.400 --> 26:13.867
Henry is a cousin,
Ernie is her neighbor

26:13.933 --> 26:15.867
since they were kids,
and Dr. Walmer

26:16.767 --> 26:18.233
is 30 years old!

26:18.300 --> 26:20.833
It don't matter! All this
letter's talkin' about is men.

26:20.900 --> 26:23.067
-She's gettin' itchy.
-Yeah, very itchy.

26:24.567 --> 26:26.733
I've been meanin'
to ask her to marry me.

26:26.800 --> 26:29.800
I just can't find the
words to put in a letter.

26:31.267 --> 26:32.333
Well, you seem to find
'em pretty good

26:32.400 --> 26:33.800
when you put 'em in a song.

26:37.367 --> 26:38.600
