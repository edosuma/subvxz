00:21.255 --> 00:23.789
"Bruno Walker" sounds
like "Brutus Walker."

00:23.791 --> 00:26.258
Yeah, only Brutus
carries bigger guns.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.627
Here, 2330 Saint Nicholas,
apartment 4-D, Mills.

00:28.629 --> 00:31.630
My money says we get nothing
out of the girlfriend.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.399
Really?

00:33.401 --> 00:36.235
Where's the first place you'd
go you get released early?

00:36.237 --> 00:39.505
Plus, rumor has it, she's been
hooking out of her apartment.

00:39.507 --> 00:40.539
Oh, how
entrepreneurial.

00:40.541 --> 00:46.812
While her man's
in the slam.

GREEVEY:
Officer Rennick, Miss Sandoval,
you know this gentleman?

00:54.355 --> 00:56.355
SANDOVAL:
He came from Walker's
girlfriend's apartment.

00:56.357 --> 01:00.392
RENNICK:
I never seen this guy.

01:00.394 --> 01:05.397
Well, it ain't Walker,
Brutus or Bruno.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.232
GREEVEY:
You guys, take the roof.

01:07.234 --> 01:09.435
Come on, upstairs.

01:14.241 --> 01:15.474
This where your friend
took a flyer?

01:15.476 --> 01:18.177
He was the super's friend.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.445
Hey, we're all
friends here, honey.

01:19.447 --> 01:20.846
What the hell happened?

01:20.848 --> 01:26.652
Brutus grabs him by the neck
and throws him out.

01:26.654 --> 01:28.520
(<i> gunshot</i> )

01:28.522 --> 01:31.123
(<i> another gunshot</i> )

01:31.125 --> 01:34.359
Don't even think about leaving.

01:40.468 --> 01:41.667
Rennick?

01:42.870 --> 01:44.503
Sandoval.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.313
Oh, my God.

01:54.315 --> 01:57.316
He's still alive.

01:57.318 --> 01:59.351
Call the paramedics!

01:59.353 --> 02:01.186
Sandoval!

02:01.188 --> 02:03.422
Sandoval!

CRAGEN:
My first week on the job,
I come home

03:52.233 --> 03:57.836
and my wife has The Telegram
open to this item:

03:57.838 --> 04:02.474
"Cop killed in Brooklyn
outside a candy store."

04:02.476 --> 04:07.512
Telegram? There used to be a lot
of newspapers in New York.

04:07.514 --> 04:11.350
Then they all
started dying off.

04:11.352 --> 04:14.519
Now, it's the cops.

04:14.521 --> 04:16.355
How many this year so far?

04:16.357 --> 04:17.789
Thirteen.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.495
MAN:
Let's keep it
clear here, folks.

04:23.497 --> 04:24.930

through here.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.032
Come on, get back.
Step back. Come on.

04:32.706 --> 04:35.274
They couldn't
resuscitate him.

04:35.276 --> 04:36.441
You guys go ahead.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.010
I'll be over in a minute.

04:41.915 --> 04:44.283
You remember
The Telegram?

04:44.285 --> 04:45.784
What?

04:45.786 --> 04:48.520
Nothing.

04:53.861 --> 04:56.995
I saw the stretcher.

04:56.997 --> 05:00.032
It happens.

05:00.034 --> 05:02.968
Yeah.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.518
Anything pop on Walker?

05:19.520 --> 05:20.919
You believe
in miracles?

05:20.921 --> 05:21.987
I pray for them.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.423
I pray some cop finds him
in an alley

05:24.425 --> 05:27.859
and can save the taxpayers
the trouble of a trial.

05:27.861 --> 05:30.862
If it was you and Walker
in an alley

05:30.864 --> 05:32.864
and no one else
was there--

05:32.866 --> 05:34.833
he didn't have a gun

05:34.835 --> 05:36.468
and was going
to give himself up?

05:36.470 --> 05:38.904
I'd shoot him in the face.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.776
You want the name of Walker's
second-grade teacher?

05:44.778 --> 05:46.912
First girl who let him
lift her skirt?

05:46.914 --> 05:48.413
His mother's cousin's
friend's dry cleaner?

05:48.415 --> 05:49.548
It's all here.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.489
Turn the other cheek.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.091
You believe in that?

05:59.093 --> 06:02.361
Yeah, twice a year, Christmas
and Easter, at church.

06:02.363 --> 06:05.130
You hear Profaci?

06:05.132 --> 06:07.899
What are you taking? A poll?

06:07.901 --> 06:09.868
You agree with him?

06:17.911 --> 06:21.146
Sandoval's supposed to meet us
on 103rd street.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.481
Talk about cold.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.915
She loses a partner...

06:23.917 --> 06:25.917
Hey, hey, hey, don't
hold that against her.

06:25.919 --> 06:28.854
Everyone deals
with it differently.

06:28.856 --> 06:32.524
They crossed over
from that roof.

06:32.526 --> 06:33.925
Walker?

06:33.927 --> 06:35.093
Couldn't see him.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.928
It was dark.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.931
Maybe you saw
some muzzle flashes, hmm?

06:39.933 --> 06:43.135
Or a light in one of the
stairwell doors being opened?

06:43.137 --> 06:46.571
I guess I was looking
the wrong way.

06:51.645 --> 06:55.414
My call is Walker took
these stairs down.

06:55.416 --> 06:57.082
Now you and Rennick

06:57.084 --> 06:58.850
when you came onto the roof,

06:58.852 --> 07:00.952
were you together
or did you split apart?

07:00.954 --> 07:02.888
How many citations for
bravery do you have, Logan?

07:02.890 --> 07:05.024
I've got six.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.159
No one's questioning
your courage, Sandoval.

07:07.161 --> 07:08.593
Except you.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.695
Back off, Mike.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.568
Let's go check
with the super.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.503
How do I know what goes on

07:18.505 --> 07:20.672
in the middle of the night
on the roof?

07:20.674 --> 07:22.941
Do you guys know how many people

07:22.943 --> 07:24.943
have died in this building
over the years?

07:24.945 --> 07:26.511
Mr. Jost...

07:26.513 --> 07:29.948
One body we discovered
because it had stinked.

07:29.950 --> 07:34.453
Another-- a baby-- gets pushed
down the incinerator chute.

07:34.455 --> 07:36.455
These people are animals.

07:36.457 --> 07:38.490
Look, could you help me out
a little bit here?

07:38.492 --> 07:39.925
No one likes it.

07:39.927 --> 07:42.060
You don't. I don't.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.996
The company that pays
my salary don't.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.665
But one thing
they don't like neither,

07:46.667 --> 07:48.934
they don't like it
when the property

07:48.936 --> 07:50.202
doesn't get taken care of.

07:50.204 --> 07:53.004
Yo, Jack! Two people got
killed here last night

07:53.006 --> 07:55.140
and one of them
was a cop.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.008
So?

07:57.010 --> 08:00.745
Never could figure out
what all the fuss was about

08:00.747 --> 08:02.481
when a cop gets killed.

08:02.483 --> 08:04.950
You guys get paid
to deal with scum.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.685
What the hell do you think's

08:06.687 --> 08:09.187
going to happen
to you you do that?

08:09.189 --> 08:12.591
Two weeks, three weeks from now,
you'll be gone

08:12.593 --> 08:14.125
but I'll still be here.

08:14.127 --> 08:17.496
And so will the company
that pays my salary.

08:17.498 --> 08:21.166
Supplemented by a little
procuring, of course.

08:21.168 --> 08:24.769
Procuring? I don't know
what that is, but you can't...

08:24.771 --> 08:27.506
He doesn't know
what the word means.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.508
How about pimping, Jost?

08:29.510 --> 08:32.777
Like in the Cassie Mills
Elevator Service, Incorporated?

08:32.779 --> 08:35.547
Just s soon as I finish
cleaning up here

08:35.549 --> 08:36.982
I got plenty of time.

08:41.522 --> 08:45.524
It's a pretty nice jacket
for somebody to throw away.

08:45.526 --> 08:48.560
The kids hang around
back here, making a mess.

08:48.562 --> 08:49.995
They leave me alone.

08:49.997 --> 08:52.063
I leave them alone.
Know what I mean?

08:52.065 --> 08:53.732
Someone left it
last night?

08:53.734 --> 08:55.166
Yeah.

08:55.168 --> 08:56.568
Red.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.609
Pass the ball, man.
Pass the ball.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.821
A wise ass.

09:16.823 --> 09:18.256
Yo.

09:18.258 --> 09:21.293
Hey, listen up,
anyone recognize this jacket?

09:21.295 --> 09:24.062
(<i> dance music playing</i> )

09:53.160 --> 09:56.194
See, folks, what we got here
is an entertainment situation.

09:56.196 --> 10:01.099
Me and my colleagues over here
are the entertainers.

10:01.101 --> 10:04.235
And you folks, well,
you're the entertainees.

10:04.237 --> 10:07.706
Like Indiana Jones
over here.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.108
See, if you stop
to watch baby bro

10:10.110 --> 10:12.177
I figure you've been
entertained, am I right?

10:12.179 --> 10:14.846
So you might want to become
part of the paying audience,

10:14.848 --> 10:16.615
if you get my drift.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.650
Baby brother needs
a new pair of shoes.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.151
Hey, hey, Red, Red.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.120
I don't take food stamps.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.188
I'll be right back.

10:29.696 --> 10:31.663
You work this spot
last night, Red?

10:31.665 --> 10:33.732
Yeah, eight 82nd avenue.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.900
Made some good money, too.

10:35.902 --> 10:37.402
You can ask the lady
in the restaurant.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.870
She'll tell you.

10:38.872 --> 10:39.771
After that?

10:39.773 --> 10:40.772
Home.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.707
But you stopped off

10:42.709 --> 10:45.110
on 103rd street to blow
a little weed, right?

10:45.112 --> 10:46.778
And guess what-- you left
your jacket there.

10:46.780 --> 10:50.181
That used to be my jacket.

10:50.183 --> 10:51.182
LOGAN:
And now?

10:51.184 --> 10:52.217
It's my ex.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.786
She kept missing
rehearsal.

10:54.788 --> 10:58.657
So I had to throw her out
of the act, you know?

11:00.327 --> 11:02.127
Guess what, Red.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.929
You get to take us to her.

11:05.899 --> 11:08.133
GIRL:
When we split up...

11:08.135 --> 11:10.168
Kept it as a souvenir?

11:10.170 --> 11:11.770
Oh, this old stuff.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.138
Not so old.

11:13.140 --> 11:15.140
You were wearing it
last night.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.875
On 103rd street
and Saint Nicholas.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.743
Yeah, back of #70.

11:18.745 --> 11:20.145
Don't touch me!

11:20.147 --> 11:21.946
Don't you touch me.

11:24.317 --> 11:27.185
I don't let no man touch me.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.354
Where did you
get the gun, Revina?

11:29.356 --> 11:32.824
I... I found it.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.392
Take it easy.

11:34.394 --> 11:38.196
I found it back
of the apartment.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.165
It's okay, Revina.

11:40.167 --> 11:43.201
And I took it so no one
would mess with me.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.904
No one would ever
mess with me again.

11:45.906 --> 11:50.942
Put the gun down slowly.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.779
It's okay.

11:54.781 --> 11:57.782
Put it down slowly.

11:57.784 --> 12:00.719
Nobody's going
to mess with you.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.454
Put it down.

12:12.866 --> 12:16.434
So, ballistics says Rennick
was killed with the same .32

12:16.436 --> 12:19.003
That we took away
from Revina Price.

12:19.005 --> 12:20.872
And the gouge on
the barrel happened

12:20.874 --> 12:22.874
when the gun hit
the pavement
from the height.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.442
Maybe.

12:25.812 --> 12:27.879
You hate the Mets, right?

12:27.881 --> 12:30.882
Almost as much
as you hate the Yankees.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.884
We don't agree
about a lot of things.

12:32.886 --> 12:35.420
All right, so,
potahtoes, potatoes.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.888
So, why do we agree

12:36.890 --> 12:39.424
that something
doesn't add up here?

12:39.426 --> 12:41.426
All right,
Walker shoots Rennick,

12:41.428 --> 12:44.462
throws the gun
off the roof.

12:44.464 --> 12:47.899
How about Walker drops the gun

12:47.901 --> 12:51.903
as he's walking
down the fire escape?

12:51.905 --> 12:53.404
Carmen-- Greevey.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.840
I want you to run
some serial numbers

12:55.842 --> 12:57.776
on a .32 S & W.

12:57.778 --> 13:02.247
I keep hearing the zipper
on Rennick's body bag.

13:03.283 --> 13:06.050
Great.
A 15-Year-old high school girl.

13:06.052 --> 13:07.919
Some neighborhood kid.

13:07.921 --> 13:11.156
She says she picked it up
in back of the building.

13:11.158 --> 13:13.491
Max, can I see you for a second?

13:13.493 --> 13:16.060
Yeah.

13:16.062 --> 13:18.830
The girl ever use guns?
She got a record?

13:18.832 --> 13:22.066
No, and she's got no motive
to shoot a cop.

13:22.068 --> 13:23.935
The problem is

13:23.937 --> 13:26.070
her prints are on the gun,
Brutus Walker's aren't.

13:26.072 --> 13:28.173
So Walker tosses a guy
out the window,

13:28.175 --> 13:30.809
runs up to the roof,
shoots Rennick

13:30.811 --> 13:33.545
and then wipes the gun clean
before he drops it?

13:33.547 --> 13:35.980
I don't know. It was cold.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.216
Maybe he was wearing gloves.

13:38.218 --> 13:41.586
How well do you shoot a gun
with gloves on?

13:41.588 --> 13:44.956
The serial number on the gun
that shot Rennick?

13:44.958 --> 13:47.926
Sold by Jovino's Gun Shop,
West 17th, off Ninth.

13:55.068 --> 13:57.936
GREEVEY:
Tell us about the robbery.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.838
What did they take?

13:59.840 --> 14:03.608
They took four pump shotguns
and eight handguns.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.376
Is this one of them?

14:05.378 --> 14:07.312
Right make.
Right model.

14:07.314 --> 14:10.114
Looks pretty beat up, though.

14:10.116 --> 14:12.083
Somebody wanted to see
if it could bounce.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.985
You got the serial
number?

14:13.987 --> 14:16.120
I got the serial numbers, too.

14:16.122 --> 14:17.388
Old habit.

14:17.390 --> 14:20.992
I used to be on the job
before this happened.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.260
The Three-Nine.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.963
Did you ever work
the South Bronx?

14:24.965 --> 14:26.865
No, but I worked The Rug.

14:26.867 --> 14:27.999
Brooklyn?

14:28.001 --> 14:30.869
Ooh, that precinct was
a real hellhole.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.370
Late '60s.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.139
Same here in the South Bronx.

14:35.141 --> 14:39.878
They used to throw stuff at you
from the windows on slow days.

14:39.880 --> 14:44.082
Do you remember that coach
that we used to have back then?

14:44.084 --> 14:46.150
Hard to dodge
in those tents

14:46.152 --> 14:48.953
but thank God
for the slow days

14:48.955 --> 14:52.991
because on the days
that weren't slow...

14:52.993 --> 14:54.626
That what happened?

14:54.628 --> 14:57.161
No, I was
on foot patrol.

14:57.163 --> 15:01.032
I was going down the subway
to use the can in winter

15:01.034 --> 15:03.201
and I hit an icy step.

15:04.938 --> 15:06.170
Broken back?

15:06.172 --> 15:08.406
Yeah.

15:08.408 --> 15:12.310
Thanks for your help, Ross.

15:12.312 --> 15:15.146
20% off, anybody with a badge.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.323
Boy, that is rough.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.125
Yeah.

15:27.127 --> 15:30.161
I don't think I'd make it
like that in a wheelchair.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.396
I'd rather go quick.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.131
Like Rennick?

15:33.133 --> 15:36.100
And what happens
to the family?

15:44.344 --> 15:48.246
GREEVEY:
<i> Cassie, we need some answers</i>

15:48.248 --> 15:50.248
about Brutus.

15:50.250 --> 15:53.251
I ain't talking no more
about Brutus.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.987
If he bothers you,
you call us.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.422
And what?

15:57.424 --> 16:00.058
You meet me
at the hospital?

16:00.060 --> 16:03.428
You cops-- you always saying,
"cooperate, cooperate.

16:03.430 --> 16:07.131
I'll make sure
nothing happens to you."

16:07.133 --> 16:10.969
And then, either you catch
the guy or you don't.

16:10.971 --> 16:13.271
You put him away or you don't.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.206
And then it don't matter

16:15.208 --> 16:18.176
because he gets out
or he got friends.

16:18.178 --> 16:21.245
Unless you are willing to walk
two steps behind me

16:21.247 --> 16:24.482
for the rest of my life,
you can't make me safe.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.485
No one's ever safe, Cassie.

16:30.423 --> 16:33.424
You know, when I was a kid

16:33.426 --> 16:38.262
my mama-- she say--
you do right and you be okay.

16:38.264 --> 16:44.135
Well, I guess when you a kid,
you got to believe that

16:44.137 --> 16:47.472
or else you won't never grow up.

16:50.276 --> 16:54.278
That don't look like
none of Brutus' guns.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.280
He like big ones.

16:56.282 --> 16:58.082
Big ones.

16:58.084 --> 16:59.784
Are you sure
that's not his?

16:59.786 --> 17:01.786
'Cause you said he
had a lot of guns.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.055
Brutus had more guns
than he had shoes

17:04.057 --> 17:05.456
and, honey, he had shoes.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.159
But if you want to be sure,
go ask his sister.

17:08.161 --> 17:10.061
More like his mama.

17:10.063 --> 17:13.064
Anytime something went
wrong, Brutus ran to her.

17:13.066 --> 17:16.300
I guess even Brutus
gets scared sometimes.

17:16.302 --> 17:19.437
WOMAN:
<i> Brutus never had no trouble.</i>

17:19.439 --> 17:21.439
It was everyone
who met him

17:21.441 --> 17:23.174
had the trouble.

17:23.176 --> 17:25.443
No. He doesn't
have a gun.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.178
He never did.

17:27.180 --> 17:30.181
So he just pushed that slug
into Cruz with his thumb?

17:30.183 --> 17:32.784
She's not going to change.

17:32.786 --> 17:35.086
Her brother's a saint.

17:35.088 --> 17:37.255
In another
hundred years

17:37.257 --> 17:40.825
he'll be stuck
on people's dashboards.

17:47.300 --> 17:51.235
I got nothing to say.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.304
Well, in case
you change your mind...

17:53.306 --> 17:55.273
No, I don't
need that,

17:55.274 --> 17:57.241
'cause I ain't never going
to see you guys again.

17:57.243 --> 17:58.509
Yes, you are.

17:58.511 --> 18:02.814
When you bury
your cop-killer brother.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.223
Listen good, my man.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.225
When we nail Brutus
and find out

18:14.227 --> 18:16.094
you could have helped us
and didn't

18:16.096 --> 18:19.230
we'll be back and you'll go down
for conspiracy.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.566
Maybe accessory
after the fact.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.336
Brutus showed up
at the store

18:25.338 --> 18:27.171
right after he got loose
from Rikers.

18:27.173 --> 18:29.140
Made some calls.

18:29.142 --> 18:34.112
I told Mavis to send him back,
but she gave him her car keys.

18:34.114 --> 18:38.216
I don't see how you can say
Segovia and Eric Clapton

18:38.218 --> 18:39.851
in the same breath.

18:39.853 --> 18:41.486
Sandoval, hey,
how you doing?

18:41.488 --> 18:43.287
Take off the kid gloves,
Greevey.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.422
I'm not that fragile.

18:44.424 --> 18:45.523
Hey, ease up,
all right?

18:45.525 --> 18:47.291
He's just asking you
how you feel.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.227
I can handle what I got
to handle, okay?

18:49.229 --> 18:50.461
You know, if you
didn't just...

18:50.463 --> 18:52.296
Easy, easy.
If I didn't
what, Logan?

18:52.298 --> 18:54.332
If I didn't just
lose my partner?

18:54.334 --> 18:55.366
If I weren't in mourning?

18:55.368 --> 18:57.268
Spit it out.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.303
Hey, Sandoval.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.305
Okay, I don't like you.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.407
I didn't like you
before Rennick was killed

19:03.409 --> 19:05.276
and his being dead
doesn't change that.

19:05.278 --> 19:07.262
In fact...

19:07.263 --> 19:09.247
What? If it had been Greevey,
you'd be red-eyed and weepy?

19:09.249 --> 19:10.765
No you wouldn't.

19:10.766 --> 19:12.282
You'd be showing everyone
how tough you are,

19:12.285 --> 19:13.584
that you can handle it.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.253
but because I'm a woman,
if I'm not sobbing,

19:15.255 --> 19:17.205
you think it doesn't hurt.

19:17.206 --> 19:19.156
You know, I'm just as much
of a cop as you are, Logan,

19:19.159 --> 19:20.458
and I am
just as tough as you are.

19:20.460 --> 19:23.661
And I got a dead partner

19:23.663 --> 19:27.431
and my feelings about that
are my own business.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.333
Ask your partner.

19:29.335 --> 19:32.370
Way I heard it,
he was no barrel of laughs

19:32.372 --> 19:34.939
when his partner bought it.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.643
You lost a partner?

19:38.645 --> 19:40.645
That was a long time ago.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.446
Hey, hey,
Max, wait a minute.

19:42.448 --> 19:45.483
You didn't even mention it.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.518
It wasn't relevant.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.254
It was a long time ago.

19:50.256 --> 19:54.892
He didn't observe procedure
at a traffic stop.

19:54.894 --> 19:58.396
Went over
to the driver's window--

19:58.398 --> 20:00.298
bammo.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.266
That's all she wrote.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.406
That's crap, Simpson.

20:08.408 --> 20:11.342
I may'm not be as eloquent
as Sergeant Greevey

20:11.344 --> 20:13.678
but I'm afraid I'd have to
agree with his assessment.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.613
Walker thinks we got
nothing better to do

20:15.615 --> 20:17.281
than accuse him
of shooting Rennick

20:17.283 --> 20:19.750
so that we can
execute him on sight?

20:19.752 --> 20:22.520
Give me a break.

20:22.522 --> 20:25.256
You know
as well as I do

20:25.258 --> 20:27.391
Walker's a dead man.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.493
Hey, if he stays on
the street, you're right.

20:29.495 --> 20:32.263
If he's ready to surrender,
we'll make sure he's safe.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.265
He'll surrender
if you give him immunity.

20:34.267 --> 20:35.666
Immunity?

20:35.668 --> 20:37.635
Why don't we give
him a pension?

20:37.637 --> 20:39.670
In exchange for information.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.372
Rennick's pension.

20:41.374 --> 20:43.474
He says he didn't kill Rennick.

20:43.476 --> 20:44.742
Right, right.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.445
The bullet in Rennick's neck
and Rennick's death,

20:47.447 --> 20:49.247
are just
a coincidence, huh?

20:49.249 --> 20:51.415
I may not know where he is,

20:51.417 --> 20:53.651
or what he did
or did not do, Detective,

20:53.653 --> 20:56.587
but I do know what he told me
on the telephone.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.322
You want to make the deal, fine.

20:58.324 --> 21:00.358
You don't, I'll communicate it
to my client.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.627
We're not in the habit
of making blind deals

21:02.629 --> 21:05.329
with cop-killers, Mr. Simpson.
Good day.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.437
And if it hadn't been a cop,

21:13.439 --> 21:15.673
what would your
decision be then?

21:15.675 --> 21:17.475
Think about it.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.383
Well?

21:25.385 --> 21:29.020
Walker's driving around
in his sister's car.

21:29.022 --> 21:30.588
We called in a CB.

21:30.590 --> 21:31.756
Walker's brother-in-law,
Ray,

21:31.758 --> 21:34.058
says he was talking
on the phone.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.560
I'm gonna need a subpoena
to get those phone records.

21:36.562 --> 21:39.530
What do you think
about what Simpson said?

21:39.532 --> 21:41.432
GREEVEY:
What?

21:41.434 --> 21:44.302
That if it hadn't been
a cop shot

21:44.304 --> 21:47.305
would we be more likely
to make a deal?

21:47.307 --> 21:49.507
It was a cop.

21:49.509 --> 21:52.410
Just go check
the phone records.

21:52.412 --> 21:54.011
See who he called,
okay?

21:54.013 --> 21:55.846
Laneer!

21:57.850 --> 21:59.850
Very photogenic, Laneer.

21:59.852 --> 22:02.653
You look just like
your mug shots.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.388
Even from the back.

22:04.390 --> 22:06.090
Sergeant Greevey,
Detective Logan.

22:06.092 --> 22:09.026
I must have owed money
in a previous life.

22:09.028 --> 22:10.428
This ain't the
Borscht Belt, Laneer.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.030
Save the shtick.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.631
The name Brutus Walker strike
your funny bone, Laneer?

22:13.633 --> 22:15.399
Can't say that it does.

22:15.401 --> 22:17.385
Wrong answer.

22:17.386 --> 22:19.370
Phone company says he called you
from his sister's house.

22:19.372 --> 22:21.539
I told him I couldn't do
a thing for him.

22:21.541 --> 22:25.042
You're still
tap dancing, Kevin.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.510
Man, you think I'm crazy?

22:26.512 --> 22:28.612
I got four more months
on parole.

22:28.614 --> 22:29.880
I got a good job.

22:29.882 --> 22:31.882
I'm happy on the outside.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.384
I'm happy you're happy.

22:33.386 --> 22:35.419
Do you want
to bug my phone?

22:35.421 --> 22:37.421
Go ahead.

22:37.422 --> 22:39.422
You want to toss my place?
Be my guest.

22:39.425 --> 22:41.459
(<i> beeper</i> )

22:43.730 --> 22:46.530
We got to take
this call. Go on.

22:50.470 --> 22:53.637
WOMAN:
The car is registered
to Walker's sister.

22:53.639 --> 22:55.539
I double-checked it.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.608
That's a two-base hit.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.677
If Walker shows up,
we got a home run.

22:59.679 --> 23:01.379
Spotted it
two hours ago.

23:01.381 --> 23:02.613
No one's
come near it.

23:02.615 --> 23:03.881
Call in for a
surveillance request.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.883
Schermerhorn
and Sullivan.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.685
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

23:07.687 --> 23:09.887
Sullivan and Brent.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.622
Laneer's
parole officer.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.791
Said he works in a park
at Sullivan and Brent.

23:13.793 --> 23:15.760
That's right around
the corner, next block.

23:15.762 --> 23:18.496
We may have batted
this one out of the park.

23:18.498 --> 23:20.631
Call in for backup,
a lot of backup.

23:20.633 --> 23:23.901
No lights, no sirens.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.537
Sector Adam calling Central K.

23:29.609 --> 23:32.109
Quitting time, Brutus!

23:32.111 --> 23:34.578
Nice disguise, though.

23:34.580 --> 23:38.549
(<i> sighs</i> )
You want me to run,

23:38.551 --> 23:42.620
so you can shoot me
and be a hero.

23:44.557 --> 23:46.857
Disappointed?

23:55.701 --> 23:58.502
Not yet, Walker.

23:58.504 --> 24:00.571
Not yet.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.875
We've charged Walker

24:04.876 --> 24:06.709
with throwing Ramos
out of Cassie Mill's window.

24:06.712 --> 24:07.912
She's cooperating,
and with her testimony,

24:07.914 --> 24:10.014
I'm pushing for an
early court date,

24:10.016 --> 24:12.183
even though Walker's
lawyer will try to stall.

24:12.185 --> 24:14.118
Yeah, did you read a paper
this morning?

24:14.120 --> 24:15.853
The<i> Times.</i>
<i> Times,</i> huh?

24:15.855 --> 24:17.455
Well, I've read four.

24:17.457 --> 24:19.690
They hardly mentioned
the flying Ramos.

24:19.692 --> 24:22.193
Paul, tell him
who they mentioned.

24:22.195 --> 24:24.728
Rennick.
Rennick. Rennick.

24:24.730 --> 24:27.765
New Yorkers don't
always love their cops

24:27.767 --> 24:30.835
but they hate the people
who kill them.

24:30.837 --> 24:32.770
I want him convicted.

24:32.772 --> 24:34.372
Let's slow down and do it right.

24:34.373 --> 24:35.973
The press starts chewing
on your heels, blame me.

24:35.975 --> 24:39.210
Yeah.<i> Starts</i> chewing, huh?

24:39.212 --> 24:41.812
It's a cop-killer
we're talking about.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.714
We let him walk,

24:43.716 --> 24:47.117
I'll be deboned,
butterflied, and flambéed.

24:47.119 --> 24:49.920
I want this off the front page.

24:58.498 --> 25:01.065
The Rennick case is going
to take time to prepare.

25:01.067 --> 25:02.533
Take time? That's
a good euphemism.

25:02.535 --> 25:04.768
All right, then it's going
to take a lot of luck.

25:04.770 --> 25:05.970
Lacking any evidence,

25:05.972 --> 25:08.105
I'd say that was an
optimistic assessment.

25:08.107 --> 25:09.240
We've got
Sandoval's statement.

25:09.242 --> 25:10.841
That the roof
was dark,

25:10.843 --> 25:12.243
that they were shot
at from ambush,

25:12.245 --> 25:13.911
that she never
saw clearly enough

25:13.913 --> 25:15.813
to return any fire,

25:15.815 --> 25:18.249
and that she didn't even
see Walker's escape route.

25:18.251 --> 25:21.986
Oh, I never said we could prove
Walker was on the roof.

25:21.988 --> 25:23.287
Why, Detective?

25:23.289 --> 25:25.789
Because Brutus Walker
was Cistal's cell mate.

25:25.791 --> 25:28.592
Now, what did Cistal have
when he was arrested?

25:28.594 --> 25:30.861
Suspect had
in his possession

25:30.863 --> 25:34.265
four shotguns
and seven handguns.

25:34.267 --> 25:37.268
All of which were traced
to Ross's gun store.

25:37.270 --> 25:40.604
But Ross says there were
eight handguns

25:40.606 --> 25:42.239
stolen from his shop.

25:42.241 --> 25:45.142
And when my husband reported
the fender-bender he was in

25:45.144 --> 25:46.577
to the insurance company,

25:46.579 --> 25:47.912
he threw in
the broken light

25:47.914 --> 25:49.813
from six months
before.

25:49.815 --> 25:51.882
Ross has no reason to lie.

25:51.884 --> 25:55.019
He even had the serial number
of the eighth gun.

25:55.021 --> 25:57.888
Just like the one
that killed Rennick.

25:57.890 --> 25:58.889
I know.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.558
Are you planning

26:00.559 --> 26:02.226
to charge Walker
in this lifetime?

26:02.228 --> 26:04.562
Maybe I should rephrase that.

26:04.564 --> 26:08.098
'Cause a lifetime in this city
can be pretty short,

26:08.100 --> 26:10.134
especially if you're a cop.

26:10.136 --> 26:12.069
You think a badge
makes one life

26:12.071 --> 26:13.871
more valuable
than another, Trent?

26:13.873 --> 26:17.274
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do.

26:17.276 --> 26:20.578
All Brutus Walker wants
is the opportunity

26:20.580 --> 26:21.912
to speak with you.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.315
Really? A discussion
of Fifth Amendment rights?

26:24.317 --> 26:25.916
Get serious, Stone.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.318
How serious
do you want it?

26:27.320 --> 26:29.920
I am not interested
in making any deal.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.089
Hey, look, I'm just
Walker's messenger.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.090
Really?

26:33.092 --> 26:34.875
Then don't call me

26:34.876 --> 26:36.659
until his lawyer
wants to get serious.

26:41.601 --> 26:44.602
STONE:
<i> I'm going to show you</i>
<i> something that may belong</i>

26:44.604 --> 26:46.370
<i> to your ex-cell mate,</i>
<i> Mr. Walker.</i>

26:46.372 --> 26:49.840
Do you recognize it?

26:49.842 --> 26:51.241
It's a gun.

26:51.243 --> 26:52.676
Very good, Cistal.

26:52.678 --> 26:54.912
Can you spell "gun"?

26:54.914 --> 26:55.946
Sure.

26:55.948 --> 27:00.851
D-e-a-l.

27:00.853 --> 27:03.020
Maybe we ought to trade seats.

27:03.022 --> 27:06.123
I hear yours is getting
a little hot lately.

27:06.125 --> 27:07.257
If I were you,

27:07.259 --> 27:10.194
I'd indict Brutus Walker
like yesterday.

27:10.196 --> 27:12.363
You passed the spelling test.

27:12.365 --> 27:15.132
Obviously, you read
the newspapers.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.300
Can you count?

27:16.302 --> 27:19.169
Part of the haul
you took from Ross's shop.

27:19.171 --> 27:20.671
You took eight guns.

27:20.673 --> 27:21.872
You were picked up
with seven.

27:21.874 --> 27:23.073
It was that new math.

27:23.075 --> 27:24.375
Let me guess.

27:24.377 --> 27:26.644
I'll bet this is
a ballistics report

27:26.646 --> 27:29.413
that says the bullet
that killed that cop

27:29.415 --> 27:30.714
came from this gun.

27:30.716 --> 27:32.416
And I'll bet you're
going to ask me

27:32.418 --> 27:34.418
if I sold Brutus
that gun.

27:36.422 --> 27:41.392
I can solve your problem
and my problem all at once.

27:41.394 --> 27:42.960
You just tell me

27:42.962 --> 27:46.330
when and where
I sold Walker that gun.

27:46.332 --> 27:47.998
My guess is that you and I

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
won't be talking to each other
about this case.

27:50.002 --> 27:51.235
You're missing
a bet, Stone.

27:51.237 --> 27:53.704
I can give you
whatever you need.

27:53.706 --> 27:55.339
I don't think so.

27:57.309 --> 27:59.810
Cistal's arrest 49s.

27:59.811 --> 28:02.312
When the guns were recovered
from Cistal's apartment,

28:02.314 --> 28:03.714
all except our .32,

28:03.716 --> 28:06.016
Rennick was one
of the search party.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.918
Was Sandoval there?

28:07.920 --> 28:09.019
No, they weren't
partnered up then.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.121
Eight to five

28:11.123 --> 28:13.123
Rennick helped himself
to the gun.

28:13.125 --> 28:14.458
Why?

28:14.460 --> 28:15.926
It's untraceable.

28:15.928 --> 28:18.162
A lot of old-timers
carry drop pieces.

28:18.164 --> 28:20.130
If they shoot someone,
they say they had a gun

28:20.132 --> 28:21.599
and they can't find it,

28:21.600 --> 28:23.067
so they drop untraceable iron
on them.

28:23.069 --> 28:25.269
Up in Harlem once,
they found some stiff

28:25.271 --> 28:27.271
with six guns underneath him.

28:27.273 --> 28:28.939
(<i> chuckles</i> )
So what are you saying?

28:28.941 --> 28:30.107
Rennick shot himself,

28:30.109 --> 28:32.976
then dropped the .32
to implicate Walker?

28:32.978 --> 28:37.014
I don't know what I'm saying.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.453
No, that wasn't
one of Pete's guns.

28:42.455 --> 28:45.355
This is important,
Mrs. Rennick.

28:45.357 --> 28:46.457
He only had two.

28:46.459 --> 28:48.425
His on-duty and
one for off-duty.

28:48.427 --> 28:50.794
A lot of cops keep
an unofficial weapon.

28:50.796 --> 28:52.362
No one minds it, really,

28:52.364 --> 28:54.465
and a lot of wives
don't even know about it.

28:54.467 --> 28:56.333
I knew everything
about Pete.
You did?

28:56.335 --> 28:58.736
He talked to you a
lot about the job, huh?

29:02.408 --> 29:03.774
So?

29:03.776 --> 29:05.476
These are great.

29:05.478 --> 29:07.277
I have a few myself.

29:07.279 --> 29:10.481
But this, this television...

29:10.483 --> 29:13.517
this is nice.

29:13.519 --> 29:16.120
It's expensive though.

29:16.122 --> 29:19.790
Pete was always
a good provider.

29:19.792 --> 29:23.761
He always took
the maximum overtime.

29:26.499 --> 29:27.531
Who was on duty

29:27.533 --> 29:29.500
when Rennick's locker
was opened?

29:29.502 --> 29:31.001
Me.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.369
Find anything unusual?

29:32.371 --> 29:34.404
Like what?

29:34.406 --> 29:36.340
Rennick did his job.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.208
He never complained.

29:38.210 --> 29:41.378
And he always paid
for his own cup of coffee.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.814
Cragen's got the complete list.

29:43.816 --> 29:45.449
Thanks.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.083
I'll tell you one thing
about Rennick.

29:47.086 --> 29:48.318
What's that?

29:48.320 --> 29:51.221
He didn't believe
in plea bargains.

29:52.525 --> 29:53.824
Sandoval?

29:54.560 --> 29:56.527
Check the duty roster.

29:56.529 --> 29:59.263
You got a new partner.
Officer Sandoval,

29:59.265 --> 30:01.031
I'm Paul Robinette
from the DA's office.

30:01.033 --> 30:02.432
I tried to reach you
at home.

30:02.434 --> 30:03.867
Yeah, I got
your message.

30:03.869 --> 30:06.436
Lou Bridges, my
lawyer from the PBA

30:06.438 --> 30:08.505
tells me not to
talk to anyone

30:08.507 --> 30:10.274
without him being there.

30:10.276 --> 30:12.042
Says that
includes the DA

30:12.044 --> 30:14.545
Want to talk,
clear it through him.

30:14.547 --> 30:16.413
Am I missing
something here?

30:16.415 --> 30:18.282
Aren't we
on the same side?

30:18.284 --> 30:20.517
I got to change
for roll call.

30:20.519 --> 30:21.819
Look, Officer...

30:21.821 --> 30:23.153
What, are you deaf
or just stupid?

30:23.155 --> 30:24.588
I told you, talk to Bridges!

30:28.861 --> 30:31.562
Why don't you bastards
just leave me alone, huh?

30:31.564 --> 30:33.430
The Internal Affairs
shooting team

30:33.432 --> 30:35.499
has already closed the case.

30:35.501 --> 30:36.500
That's not

30:36.502 --> 30:38.202
the only issue here.

30:38.204 --> 30:40.337
It is for me.

30:51.917 --> 30:54.484
I had Rennick's
payroll records sent over.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.186
Not a minute of overtime.

30:56.188 --> 30:57.588
Kid in college,
new car...

30:57.590 --> 30:59.923
that's a lot of mileage
out of one paycheck.

30:59.925 --> 31:02.426
So let's give him
the benefit of the doubt.

31:02.428 --> 31:03.427
Lotto.

31:03.429 --> 31:04.528
Belmont, poker.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.330
Ah, nobody's
that lucky.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.232
And if he was on
somebody's pad,

31:08.234 --> 31:10.634
what does that get us?
I don't know.

31:10.636 --> 31:12.336
Either way, he's
still a dead cop

31:12.338 --> 31:13.570
with expensive tastes.

31:13.572 --> 31:17.341
I traced his new car.

31:17.343 --> 31:19.243
WOMAN (<i> over PA system</i> ):
Service, pick up line two.

31:19.245 --> 31:22.179
It's terrible what happened
to Rennick-- terrible.

31:22.181 --> 31:25.215
I hate to lose a
customer that way.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.351
So he wasn't
a first-time buyer?
Rennick?

31:27.353 --> 31:29.419
(<i> chuckles</i> )
Rennick was like
the vernal equinox.

31:29.421 --> 31:31.355
Every spring--
robins, crocuses

31:31.357 --> 31:33.624
and Rennick in here
for a new car.

31:33.626 --> 31:35.359
Did you carry the paper?

31:35.361 --> 31:38.328
He'd trade in the old model,
pay the difference in cash.

31:38.330 --> 31:39.363
What a gent.

31:39.365 --> 31:41.131
Yeah.
They were coming
in Friday.

31:41.133 --> 31:43.500
I was having the cars
detailed today.

31:43.502 --> 31:44.635
Cars?

31:44.637 --> 31:46.270
A blue wagon

31:46.271 --> 31:47.904
and a white Corvette
for the missus.

31:47.907 --> 31:49.539
She didn't seem
like the Corvette type.

31:49.541 --> 31:50.908
Who are you kidding?

31:50.910 --> 31:52.242
That foxy blonde?

31:52.244 --> 31:54.278
Hell of a looker
for a widow.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.446
She may want
the 'Vette yet.

32:00.686 --> 32:02.686
Her name is Louisa Birken,
a model.

32:02.688 --> 32:04.288
Rennick told her
he was undercover.

32:04.290 --> 32:07.024
Beautiful. Case gets
better and better.

32:07.026 --> 32:08.325
Want to write
the headline?

32:08.327 --> 32:10.694
"Dead Cop
in Love Nest With Model."

32:10.696 --> 32:12.663
How did she meet him?

32:12.664 --> 32:14.631
She was trying to find her way
to Bloomingdale's.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.166
And he came
to the rescue?

32:16.168 --> 32:18.335
Heidi and Peter,
hand in hand ever since.

32:18.337 --> 32:20.170
I'm meeting her this afternoon.

32:20.172 --> 32:23.140
Do you mind explaining
how this is going to help us

32:23.142 --> 32:25.392
convict Brutus Walker?

32:25.393 --> 32:27.643
I don't know, but it's not
something I can ignore.

32:30.983 --> 32:33.650
ROBINETTE:
Rennick paid all the bills?

32:33.652 --> 32:37.020
Rent, phone, food?

32:37.022 --> 32:39.423
He liked to show his affection,
he said.

32:39.425 --> 32:41.992
Why did he do all this?

32:41.994 --> 32:44.127
So you'd remember him
when he wasn't around?

32:44.129 --> 32:46.230
(<i> scoffs</i> )

32:46.231 --> 32:48.332
I know what you're thinking,
and I know what this looks like,

32:48.334 --> 32:50.267
but Peter really loved me.

32:50.269 --> 32:52.669
How often
did you see him?

32:52.671 --> 32:54.438
Four or five times a week,

32:54.440 --> 32:57.140
unless he was away
on assignment.

32:57.142 --> 32:59.676
Did he use the telephone much?

32:59.678 --> 33:01.278
Mm-mm. No.

33:01.280 --> 33:04.047
Did any people visit him
at your apartment?

33:04.049 --> 33:05.749
No.

33:05.751 --> 33:08.385
Did you ever see him
with this gun?

33:08.387 --> 33:11.321
No.

33:13.359 --> 33:18.362
I think he was married,
but, uh...

33:18.364 --> 33:21.298
but he said not.

33:25.237 --> 33:29.139
(<i> sighs</i> )

33:29.141 --> 33:32.275
So...

33:32.277 --> 33:36.713
sometimes he would give me
envelopes for me to keep.

33:36.715 --> 33:40.183
What was in these envelopes?

33:40.185 --> 33:42.419
Money.

33:42.421 --> 33:46.256
You remember the dates
that this happened?

33:46.258 --> 33:49.326
Yeah.

33:49.328 --> 33:51.495
Almost every case Rennick
and Sandoval worked

33:51.497 --> 33:54.197
checks against dates Louisa told
us he gave her money to hold.

33:54.199 --> 33:56.700
Drug raid, drug raid,
drug raid, possession.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.135
That's our friend,
Walker.

33:58.137 --> 34:00.270
Twice, both looked
like clean collars.

34:00.272 --> 34:02.305
Drug raid, b and e,
dealer homicide.

34:02.307 --> 34:03.724
Most of the time,

34:03.725 --> 34:05.142
there was either drugs
or money confiscated.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.276
Most the time?

34:06.278 --> 34:08.278
Sometimes they came up
empty-handed,

34:08.280 --> 34:09.813
or so they said
in their reports.

34:09.815 --> 34:12.382
Meaning they sold the drugs
and pocketed the cash.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.284
I don't want to know this.

34:14.286 --> 34:16.753
Nobody wants to know this.

34:16.755 --> 34:18.321
STONE:
Don't sink with this one.

34:18.323 --> 34:19.723
Rennick was skimming
before you were partners.

34:19.725 --> 34:21.391
Look, I want you
to quit hassling me.

34:21.393 --> 34:22.826
Rennick's girlfriend,
that's where his money went.

34:22.828 --> 34:24.227
Where's yours?

34:24.229 --> 34:26.296
Brooklyn Federal Savings.

34:26.298 --> 34:30.300
I'm looking for more
than $2,416.

34:30.302 --> 34:33.370
Maybe it's in a shoe box
somewhere, right?

34:33.372 --> 34:35.238
My shift's going to start.

34:35.240 --> 34:36.807
Sandoval...

34:36.809 --> 34:40.143
if you are clean on this one,
you're playing it all wrong.

34:46.185 --> 34:48.252
Boy, that's quite
a coincidence

34:48.253 --> 34:50.320
running into District Attorney
Schiff in the elevator.

34:50.322 --> 34:52.389
It was a fortuitous
coincidence.

34:52.391 --> 34:55.392
You must have been riding
that elevator for hours.

34:55.394 --> 34:58.295
What are you selling?

34:58.297 --> 35:00.297
Rennick was dirty.

35:00.299 --> 35:02.566
Sounds like
the Brooklyn Bridge to me.

35:02.568 --> 35:04.201
Real dirty.

35:04.203 --> 35:06.169
He killed a drug dealer.

35:06.171 --> 35:08.271
I'm listening.

35:08.273 --> 35:10.407
I don't see you taking out
your checkbook.

35:10.409 --> 35:11.608
You don't get it,
do you, Simpson?

35:11.610 --> 35:13.276
There's no deal on this one.

35:13.278 --> 35:14.311
What's Walker's play?

35:14.313 --> 35:16.113
So Walker's got
a dead drug dealer

35:16.115 --> 35:17.614
he wants to talk about?

35:17.616 --> 35:19.282
What does Walker
get out of it?

35:19.284 --> 35:21.485
Satisfaction of being
a good citizen.

35:21.487 --> 35:24.154
Why are you being so unpleasant
about this?

35:27.559 --> 35:30.193
You think this
is unpleasant?

35:30.195 --> 35:32.629
You ever go over my head
to Schiff again,

35:32.631 --> 35:37.134
I'll show you
how really unpleasant I can be.

35:39.138 --> 35:40.604
(<i> door opens</i> )

35:42.574 --> 35:45.408
Well, at least now we know
Rennick killed a drug dealer.

35:45.410 --> 35:49.412
All we do now
is find out which one.

35:49.414 --> 35:52.516
Then all we have to do is
figure out who killed Rennick.

35:52.518 --> 35:56.219
What was the name
of that dealer homicide?

35:56.221 --> 35:58.388
Powers, right?
Ricky Powers.

35:58.390 --> 35:59.923
MAN:
Yeah, it was six weeks ago.

35:59.925 --> 36:02.626
It was awful--
screaming, cursing, shooting,

36:02.628 --> 36:05.328
and then, Ricky's dead--
sprawled all over the floor.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.464
I thought
he was a nice kid.

36:07.466 --> 36:09.299
Poor Miss Perry
was beside herself.

36:09.301 --> 36:10.934
I mean, this isn't
that type of building.

36:10.936 --> 36:12.402
Does this look like
a drug building?

36:12.404 --> 36:15.405
Which apartment
is Miss Perry's?

36:17.376 --> 36:21.311
I can't believe poor little
Ricky was selling narcotics.

36:21.313 --> 36:23.580
Someone called 911,
Miss Perry.

36:23.582 --> 36:25.415
Well, it wasn't me.

36:25.417 --> 36:26.583
I was too scared.

36:26.585 --> 36:28.451
All that yelling...

36:28.453 --> 36:31.254
You hear the man
yelling who shot Ricky?

36:33.225 --> 36:36.660
He said something like...

36:36.662 --> 36:39.663
"Nobody short stops me."

36:39.665 --> 36:41.364
Short weights.

36:41.366 --> 36:42.566
Short weights.

36:42.568 --> 36:45.602
Whatever that means.

36:45.604 --> 36:50.907
Then, after a little,
the police came--

36:50.909 --> 36:53.543
man and a woman.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.345
Ooh.

36:55.347 --> 36:58.949
That's when my blood ran cold,

36:58.951 --> 37:03.653
when they started talking,
because the man cop...

37:03.655 --> 37:06.590
it was the same voice.

37:06.592 --> 37:11.428
He was the one that
shot poor little Ricky.

37:17.002 --> 37:18.368
STONE:
It's your meeting, Brutus.

37:18.370 --> 37:21.338
I must object to my client
being shackled.

37:21.340 --> 37:22.706
I'll make a note
of that.

37:22.708 --> 37:24.407
You have two minutes.

37:24.409 --> 37:27.911
All the time you were
saying no to Simpson,

37:27.913 --> 37:29.980
I knew you'd talk to me.

37:29.982 --> 37:31.615
1:52.

37:31.617 --> 37:33.717
All right, all right.

37:33.719 --> 37:37.387
I found Ramos
with Cassie.

37:37.389 --> 37:38.755
She's my girl,

37:38.757 --> 37:41.458
but I hardly
touched him.

37:41.460 --> 37:42.759
Hardly?

37:42.761 --> 37:44.427
She's my girl.

37:44.429 --> 37:47.364
When he saw me, he got up,
he went over...

37:47.366 --> 37:49.432
STONE:
Now, let me guess,
he got so shook up,

37:49.434 --> 37:51.501
he tripped on a chair
and fell out the window.

37:51.503 --> 37:53.436
You must have been there.

37:53.438 --> 37:54.404
So?

37:54.406 --> 37:55.639
So?

37:55.641 --> 37:57.607
I want a pass on Ramos.

37:57.609 --> 38:01.044
And I'd like an evening in a
Jacuzzi with Cybill Shepherd.

38:01.046 --> 38:02.512
Hey, look, man.

38:02.514 --> 38:05.515
Cassie will never testify
against me.

38:05.517 --> 38:08.952
Yesterday, the DEA
picked her up with sale-weight.

38:08.954 --> 38:11.955
All she wants is to play
<i> Lets Make a Deal.</i>

38:11.957 --> 38:13.390
That's a set-up.

38:13.392 --> 38:14.758
You set her up!

38:14.760 --> 38:16.393
Time's up.

38:16.395 --> 38:18.662
You blew it, Stone.

38:18.664 --> 38:20.297
You blew it big!

38:20.299 --> 38:22.499
No way!

38:22.500 --> 38:24.700
No way I'll give you the name
of the guy who Rennick whacked.

38:28.407 --> 38:30.774
You mean poor little Ricky?

38:30.776 --> 38:33.476
Damn it, Stone,

38:33.478 --> 38:36.680
if you knew that
and there's no deal

38:36.682 --> 38:38.682
what's the point
of this meeting?

38:38.684 --> 38:41.685
Education.

38:41.687 --> 38:43.653
WOMAN:
What is the nature
of the emergency?

38:43.655 --> 38:45.388
BRUTUS:
I want to report a shooting.

38:45.390 --> 38:47.557
Dude's bleeding
like a stuck pig.

38:49.528 --> 38:51.661
Sure sounds like your voice
to me, Brutus.

38:51.663 --> 38:55.432
Doesn't take much to figure
Rennick offed Ricky Powers.

38:55.434 --> 38:56.700
Then, he made you call 911

38:56.702 --> 38:58.702
so he could be the first car
to respond.

38:58.704 --> 39:00.337
How am I doing?

39:00.339 --> 39:02.472
No immunity,
no plea bargains.

39:02.474 --> 39:04.574
Rennick hated plea bargains.

39:04.576 --> 39:06.443
Oh, man, Rennick
was a scum, man.

39:06.445 --> 39:09.446
He was dirty
the day he was born!

39:09.448 --> 39:12.782
Hundreds of brothers
wanted him dead!

39:12.784 --> 39:14.517
STONE:
There are, to say the least,

39:14.519 --> 39:15.852
credibility gaps,
inconsistencies.

39:15.854 --> 39:18.488
Is there something
you'd like to add?

39:18.490 --> 39:21.591
SANDOVAL:
I don't know-- why don't you
spell it out for me?

39:21.593 --> 39:23.593
STONE:
Fine. Rennick
catches Walker holding

39:23.595 --> 39:25.462
the day before he hits Ricky,

39:25.464 --> 39:27.464
and he promises Walker
that he'll let it slide

39:27.466 --> 39:30.100
if Walker will make the 911 call
from Ricky's apartment.

39:30.102 --> 39:33.136
ROBINETTE:
It was no problem.

39:33.138 --> 39:35.472
Ricky's apartment
was in your sector.

39:35.474 --> 39:37.874
Rennick just drove the
patrol car right there.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.477
Rennick goes upstairs,
shoots Ricky,

39:40.479 --> 39:42.479
leaves,
goes back down to the car.

39:42.481 --> 39:45.882
Walker stays in the apartment,
calls 911, then splits.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.484
The call goes out.

39:47.486 --> 39:49.152
You're the nearest unit.

39:49.154 --> 39:51.621
You're the first ones
on the scene,

39:51.623 --> 39:54.090
and Rennick ends up
writing all the reports

39:54.092 --> 39:56.826
on a murder that he committed.

39:56.828 --> 39:59.763
How am I doing?

40:08.440 --> 40:10.440
You know those
party favors,

40:10.442 --> 40:12.509
the ones you put your
fingers in at either end,

40:12.511 --> 40:13.676
and the more you pull,

40:13.678 --> 40:17.680
the harder it is
to get them out?

40:17.682 --> 40:19.582
The way to get free
is to relax

40:19.584 --> 40:22.719
and just let it go.

40:22.721 --> 40:28.525
Confession is good
for the soul, that it?

40:28.527 --> 40:30.727
About a year ago,

40:30.729 --> 40:34.697
I caught Rennick pocketing cash
after we took down a dealer.

40:34.699 --> 40:37.934
He offered me a cut,
I told him I'd quit first.

40:37.936 --> 40:39.669
MAN:
Nicky...

40:39.671 --> 40:41.438
I must advise you
to remain silent.

40:43.208 --> 40:48.812
He made all the "rotten job,
rotten pay" arguments, and...

40:48.814 --> 40:50.747
finally, said he'd stop.

40:50.749 --> 40:52.715
But he didn't.

40:56.455 --> 40:59.222
I always wanted to be a cop...

40:59.224 --> 41:02.692
ever since I was six years old.

41:05.564 --> 41:12.569
Rennick and I would go days
without talking about it.

41:12.571 --> 41:15.238
I think I really knew...

41:15.240 --> 41:19.142
you know, inside...

41:19.144 --> 41:21.244
I knew what was coming.

41:21.246 --> 41:24.647
Did you know
that he killed Ricky Powers?

41:27.486 --> 41:30.487
It was like watching
an accident.

41:30.489 --> 41:33.590
Having a premonition,
watching yourself

41:33.592 --> 41:37.660
go through the motions
to fulfill it.

41:43.735 --> 41:49.272
I started taping things...
for my own protection.

41:49.274 --> 41:51.841
He knew I knew too much.

41:51.843 --> 41:54.711
What?

41:54.713 --> 41:57.514
Just kept
one of those

41:57.516 --> 42:00.550
microcassette recorders
in my jacket.

42:03.755 --> 42:06.823
I can't believe he never knew.

42:09.761 --> 42:14.631
It was on the night
we came up here.

42:14.633 --> 42:16.733
Whole thing's on tape.

42:27.312 --> 42:30.313
BRIDGES:
Gentlemen, I think maybe we
should make a formal statement

42:30.315 --> 42:33.783
after I've consulted
with my client.

42:41.326 --> 42:42.759
SANDOVAL:
<i> Rennick?!</i>

42:42.761 --> 42:44.761
<i> Rennick, where are you?</i>

42:44.763 --> 42:48.631
(<i> over speaker</i> ):
Rennicko! Rennick,
I can't see you!

42:48.633 --> 42:51.768
(<i> gasping</i> ):
Rennick!

42:51.770 --> 42:53.970
(<i> gasping</i> )

42:53.972 --> 42:55.638
I can't see you!
(<i> recorder clicks</i> )

42:55.640 --> 42:57.307
STONE:
Was this where
Officer Rennick

42:57.309 --> 43:00.343
pointed his weapon
at you?

43:00.345 --> 43:03.346
He just came over
and took my piece.

43:03.348 --> 43:06.316
Where was Walker?

43:06.318 --> 43:10.620
He was well off the roof
by that time.

43:12.357 --> 43:16.759
And you didn't know
Rennick's position?

43:16.761 --> 43:20.730
I thought he'd gone around
the access door toward Walker.

43:20.732 --> 43:25.034
He was right behind me
with his gun drawn.

43:28.006 --> 43:29.906
SANDOVAL (<i> over speaker</i> ):
Pete!

43:29.908 --> 43:32.642
(<i> two guns firing</i> )

43:32.644 --> 43:34.344
Oh, God.

43:34.346 --> 43:35.712
Oh, my God.

43:41.786 --> 43:43.786
STONE:
She realized she was about
to be the victim

43:43.788 --> 43:45.722
of an accidental shooting,
so she ran.

43:45.724 --> 43:46.990
Rennick shot and missed.

43:46.992 --> 43:49.325
And she had an ankle holster
with a .32 in it.

43:49.327 --> 43:51.394
She hit him  in the neck
with the first shot.

43:51.396 --> 43:52.996
Where did she get the .32?

43:52.998 --> 43:54.397
From Rennick,

43:54.399 --> 43:56.065
when they first became partners.

43:56.067 --> 43:58.101
Someday, he said she might need
to stick it

43:58.103 --> 44:01.037
in a dead scuzball's hands
to save herself from the DA.

44:01.039 --> 44:02.772
Nice favor.
STONE:
Yeah.

44:02.774 --> 44:04.941
She sign the statement?

44:04.943 --> 44:06.342
With her lawyer present.

44:06.344 --> 44:08.711
Still have to go
to the grand jury.

44:08.713 --> 44:10.413
What are you going to ask for?

44:10.415 --> 44:12.649
Justifiable homicide.

44:14.419 --> 44:16.653
Total walk.

44:16.655 --> 44:19.022
The only thing she's guilty of
is bad judgment.

44:19.024 --> 44:21.057
She should have turned
the bastard in.

44:21.059 --> 44:22.659
She's a good cop.

44:22.661 --> 44:25.361
She's not totally cleared,
she'll lose her job.

44:25.363 --> 44:29.165
It's your call.

44:29.167 --> 44:32.969
STONE:
99 Times out of 100,
I stand in this grand jury room

44:32.971 --> 44:34.821
and ask for an indictment

44:34.822 --> 44:36.672
for permission to prove
to a jury that someone's guilty

44:36.675 --> 44:38.775
and that they ought
to be punished.

44:38.777 --> 44:40.410
And no crime cries out
for punishment

44:40.412 --> 44:43.146
more than the killing
of a police officer.

44:43.148 --> 44:45.415
However, not all homicides
are crimes,

44:45.417 --> 44:47.784
and the People believe
the death of Officer Rennick

44:47.786 --> 44:49.352
was a justifiable homicide

44:49.354 --> 44:55.024
and that Officer Sandoval
acted in self-defense.

44:55.026 --> 44:58.361
Loyalty is an important quality
among cops--

44:58.363 --> 45:01.064
for partners,
a kind of insurance,

45:01.066 --> 45:04.434
a guarantee of trust

45:04.436 --> 45:08.071
that they can depend
on one another.

45:08.073 --> 45:10.940
Today, I'll tell you
about a young cop

45:10.942 --> 45:10.973
whose partner violated
that bond of loyalty.
