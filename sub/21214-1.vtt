05:36.937 --> 05:39.338
Okay, look, I have a son.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.340
His name is hunter. Is he here?

05:41.342 --> 05:44.042

11:57.216 --> 11:59.384
Okay, you got your phone?

11:59.386 --> 12:01.886
It's like... I don't know.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.288
You promised you
wouldn't lose it.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.422
Those things aren't cheap!

12:04.424 --> 12:06.157
I think it's in my room.
I'll just...

12:06.159 --> 12:07.257
No, don't.

12:07.259 --> 12:09.027
Just finish your
breakfast, okay?

12:09.029 --> 12:10.361
You're gonna be late.

12:11.464 --> 12:13.798
I didn't lose it.
It's here somewhere.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.485
Still waiting for an answer.

15:56.021 --> 15:58.156
I woke up here.

15:58.158 --> 16:00.625
I can't move.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.694

16:04.731 --> 16:06.364
Eastern general?

16:06.366 --> 16:09.133
This isn't a hospital.

16:09.135 --> 16:13.104
There's no one here to help us.
Right now, it's just you and me.

16:13.106 --> 16:15.206

16:15.208 --> 16:16.975

16:19.345 --> 16:21.212
You've gotta get me outta here.

16:24.116 --> 16:27.251
C'mon, please.
Just unstrap my hands.

16:34.393 --> 16:36.995
No, no, no...
Please don't leave me here!

16:36.997 --> 16:38.429
You're quarantined.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.498
I'm not risking my life
to go in there.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.033
You're not coming out here.

16:42.035 --> 16:44.502
Less we know each other,
better it is for both of us.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.204
I'm Henry!

16:46.206 --> 16:48.172
So?

16:48.174 --> 16:51.075
So, I'm Henry.
I'm not just a random guy.

16:52.578 --> 16:55.213
I just don't want
to be alone in here.

16:55.215 --> 16:58.016
Okay? If it's just you and me...

16:58.018 --> 16:59.717
You want to be alone out there?

17:03.355 --> 17:05.556
We could just start
with your name.

17:07.726 --> 17:09.060
Ellie.

17:09.061 --> 17:11.061
"Ellie..."

17:11.064 --> 17:12.163
Hi.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.700
How did you get here?

17:16.702 --> 17:18.736
I woke up,

17:18.738 --> 17:20.771
same as you...

17:20.773 --> 17:23.340
In a room like this.

17:23.343 --> 17:26.310
So we're in the same boat, then.

17:26.311 --> 17:29.047
And...

17:29.049 --> 17:31.282
Now I'm pregnant.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.117
And you weren't pregnant before?

17:34.119 --> 17:35.653
Not a chance.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.055
Shit...

17:37.057 --> 17:39.123
What's happening in here?

17:39.125 --> 17:41.826
I don't know,
but everyone here's dead.

17:43.295 --> 17:44.695
Unstrap me.

17:45.764 --> 17:48.166
Please.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.834

17:57.443 --> 17:58.810

18:05.384 --> 18:07.085

18:17.463 --> 18:19.630

18:30.175 --> 18:31.776

18:31.778 --> 18:33.177

18:33.179 --> 18:35.146

19:13.653 --> 19:14.752
Okay.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.687

19:16.689 --> 19:19.724

19:19.726 --> 19:22.560
Okay, let me get some clothes.

19:22.562 --> 19:25.830

20:18.417 --> 20:20.351

20:24.823 --> 20:26.424

20:26.426 --> 20:27.625

20:27.627 --> 20:28.993
I talk. It calms my nerves.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.494
Yeah, well, silence calms mine.

21:10.503 --> 21:12.770

be this intense!

21:21.346 --> 21:22.880
That's some heavy stuff.

21:22.882 --> 21:25.483
I know what it is.
I can handle it.

22:01.421 --> 22:02.853
I don't know.

22:04.356 --> 22:07.358
Maybe she's one of the people
who locked us in here.

meet me at the exit.</i>

22:09.796 --> 22:11.696

took all those drugs.

25:22.822 --> 25:24.655

25:29.294 --> 25:31.228
I would be outside
if that worked.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.763
I had to try.

25:32.765 --> 25:34.532
What is... not now.

25:34.534 --> 25:37.134
Henry, I need you to grab
that wire and rip it out.

25:37.136 --> 25:38.302
This one?

25:38.304 --> 25:40.771
Yeah, and I need
you to connect it

25:40.773 --> 25:42.640
to this nodal point
right there...

25:42.642 --> 25:44.708
But only when I say "go,"
not before.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.110
Why are we doing this again?

25:46.112 --> 25:47.678
We're trying to trick the system

25:47.680 --> 25:49.647
into believing the fire alarm
has been activated,

25:49.649 --> 25:51.315
and hopefully that
should open this door.

25:51.317 --> 25:53.284
Can't we just use
one of these keycards?

25:53.286 --> 25:54.752
None of them have clearance.

25:54.754 --> 25:57.054
Please work, please work...

25:57.056 --> 25:59.023
Okay, and...

26:00.292 --> 26:01.325

26:28.721 --> 26:31.722

is underground...

26:31.724 --> 26:33.958

for something soon,

26:33.960 --> 26:35.926
because once the generator
reaches zero

26:35.928 --> 26:37.928

26:46.806 --> 26:48.839

are we dealing with?

26:48.841 --> 26:50.874
Enough to kill everyone
who worked here.

26:50.876 --> 26:53.177
So shouldn't we get
the lights up and running?

26:53.179 --> 26:54.477
Shouldn't that be
first priority?

26:54.479 --> 26:56.947
The backup generator has
a failsafe to preserve power.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.382
Once it reaches 50 percent,

26:58.384 --> 27:00.751
we are stuck with emergency
lighting and systems.

27:00.753 --> 27:02.786
Okay, why don't we just
refill the generator, then?

27:02.788 --> 27:03.886
You're welcome to try!

27:03.888 --> 27:06.757
It's right down there,
where those fuckers nest.

27:06.759 --> 27:07.992
Shit.

27:07.994 --> 27:10.694
We lost the lights for
ten minutes last night.

27:12.297 --> 27:14.765
Ten minutes,
and look what they did.

27:14.767 --> 27:16.667
What are "they?"

27:18.069 --> 27:19.703
I don't know.

27:19.705 --> 27:20.971
But they want blood,

27:20.973 --> 27:23.073
and they will kill
anything to get it.

27:23.075 --> 27:24.308
It's like an addiction.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.744
How the hell did you two
survive the night?

27:26.746 --> 27:28.712
Holy shit. You're pregnant!

27:28.714 --> 27:31.281
The fuck you think I was sitting
on that wheelchair for?

27:31.283 --> 27:33.984
You are the Guinea pigs!

27:33.986 --> 27:35.919
"Guinea pigs?" For what?

27:35.921 --> 27:38.055
Hey, look, I never saw
behind the curtain, okay?

27:38.057 --> 27:39.356
I wrote their software,

27:39.358 --> 27:41.225
I would come into fix the bugs...

27:41.227 --> 27:42.760
That kinda thing, that's all.

27:42.762 --> 27:44.662
But you knew that
something was wrong.

27:44.664 --> 27:47.064
Look, they were not about to
tell their dirty little secrets

27:47.066 --> 27:48.265
to a button-masher like me,

27:48.267 --> 27:50.434
but I think it's
safe to say they were

27:50.436 --> 27:53.370
not looking for a cure
for the common cold.

27:53.372 --> 27:56.273
We still need a keycard to
get through this piece of junk.

27:56.275 --> 27:58.242
You know where we are? I dunno.

27:58.244 --> 27:59.810
They picked us up,

27:59.812 --> 28:02.680
put us in the back of
a windowless Van, drove us here.

28:02.682 --> 28:05.449
We did the job, got back
in the Van, home by dinner.

28:05.451 --> 28:08.152
And you just closed your eyes,
collected your paycheque?

28:08.154 --> 28:10.187
Yeah, and what great life
choices brought you here?

28:10.189 --> 28:13.123
Okay, hey...

28:13.125 --> 28:15.092
Okay, we need to
get somewhere safer.

28:15.094 --> 28:16.460
We've got the sunlight
right here.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.195
It goes down in two hours.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.330
I'm not going back into
that fucking slaughterhouse.

28:20.332 --> 28:21.732
She's trying to help us.

28:21.734 --> 28:23.067
I'm just trying to stay alive.

28:23.069 --> 28:24.268
Somebody out there needs me.

28:24.270 --> 28:25.869
We're five feet away
from getting out.

28:25.871 --> 28:27.237
We're too exposed here.

28:27.239 --> 28:29.073
We need to get to
living quarters.

28:29.075 --> 28:31.175
It should be safer there.
I'm staying here.

28:31.177 --> 28:33.777
I don't give a shit
what you do, okay?

28:33.779 --> 28:36.213
But I'm alive, and there's
a lotta people who are not.

28:36.215 --> 28:37.481
We're right here!

28:37.483 --> 28:39.783
You know what they say...
"sometimes you have to

28:39.785 --> 28:41.852
take two steps back to
move one step forward."

28:41.854 --> 28:43.287
They say that, do they?

28:43.289 --> 28:45.189
Have a poster at home that says,

28:45.191 --> 28:46.957
"if you're running away
from killer monsters,

28:46.959 --> 28:48.025
move two steps back!"

28:48.027 --> 28:49.426
I don't think I'm smart enough

28:49.428 --> 28:51.261
to keep us both alive... she is.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.063
Y'know that leaves you
at negative one, right?

28:53.065 --> 28:54.198
What?

28:54.200 --> 28:56.133
Two steps back,
one step forward?

28:56.135 --> 28:57.835
You're still one step back.

28:57.837 --> 29:00.738
See? I told you
I wasn't smart enough.

29:00.740 --> 29:02.473
At least she can count.

29:03.508 --> 29:05.476
It's actually math.

29:05.478 --> 29:07.444
Just push me.

29:12.250 --> 29:15.886
This is where the docs
live 365 days of the year.

29:15.888 --> 29:17.387
Huh.

29:17.389 --> 29:19.423
Wonder what they do
during leap years...

29:19.425 --> 29:22.793
C'mon! That was a good one.
I'll get you to smile yet.

29:22.795 --> 29:25.062
Not a chance.

29:26.164 --> 29:27.798
<i>Warning...</i>

29:27.800 --> 29:32.469
<i>Backup generator operating
at 20 percent.</i>

29:39.511 --> 29:41.245
Perfect!

29:41.247 --> 29:43.480
We've got everything we need
to survive the night...

29:43.482 --> 29:46.984
Lights, water, and hopefully...

29:49.354 --> 29:50.954
Eat up.

29:52.957 --> 29:55.526
Why do scientists and doctors
need a chapel?

30:02.868 --> 30:06.370
So... What's the brilliant plan?

30:06.372 --> 30:08.238
If I shut down every other wing

30:08.240 --> 30:09.907
and transfer all
the power here...

30:09.909 --> 30:12.376
Shut down everywhere else.
Won't they just come up here?

30:12.378 --> 30:14.878
No, we should be fine.
We'll have light here.

30:14.880 --> 30:17.214
Well, we won't have
light for a minute.

30:17.216 --> 30:19.049
Everything's gonna
have to shut down

30:19.051 --> 30:21.451
while the transfer switches
cycles before it powers back up.

30:21.453 --> 30:24.254
But the candle should
protect us through that.

30:28.294 --> 30:30.260
These candles
have just been lit.

30:32.230 --> 30:33.997
There's someone else
alive in here.

30:40.171 --> 30:41.605
Hello?

30:41.607 --> 30:43.507
<i>Help!</i>

30:43.509 --> 30:46.343
Hello? Where are you?

30:46.345 --> 30:48.045
<i>Someone help!</i>

30:48.047 --> 30:49.613
We've gotta help.

30:49.615 --> 30:53.083
They will be dead in a second
if one of those things has them.

30:53.085 --> 30:55.586
If you turn the lights off,
they'll be dead for sure.

30:55.588 --> 30:57.588
Don't. Don't risk it.
It's not worth it.

30:57.590 --> 30:59.223
If I don't,

30:59.225 --> 31:01.625
then we're no better than
the people that put us here.

31:01.627 --> 31:04.328
Who are probably the same ones
who are screaming for help!

31:04.330 --> 31:06.029
If they're doctors,

31:06.031 --> 31:09.066
they'll know a lot more about
delivering that baby than I do.

31:18.243 --> 31:21.311
The longer you stay out there,
the more power we lose.

31:21.313 --> 31:23.313
I have to.

31:23.315 --> 31:26.149
Then take this... but know
we're not gonna waste any time

31:26.151 --> 31:27.517
if you come into trouble.

31:27.519 --> 31:29.486
Okay, be right back.

31:30.989 --> 31:34.191
<i>Say something
so I know where you are!</i>

31:34.193 --> 31:37.060
<i>Help us! We're over here!</i>

31:57.181 --> 31:59.082
Jesus Christ...

31:59.084 --> 32:02.085
Are you a doctor? No, I'm Henry.

32:02.087 --> 32:04.021
I don't need a fuckin' Henry!

32:04.023 --> 32:05.489
We've got two survivors in here.

32:05.491 --> 32:06.957
<i>One with a severed hand.</i>

32:06.959 --> 32:08.358
Bring them back here.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.093
How are we gonna help?

32:10.095 --> 32:11.395
Anyone there a doctor?

32:11.397 --> 32:12.696
None of us are doctors.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.601
Tell me that's not
a thing in there.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.169
The lights flickered.
It attacked us.

32:19.171 --> 32:21.071
We managed to get it in there,

32:21.073 --> 32:24.041
but it bit off his hand
when we were shutting the door.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.144
No, no! Hey, hey!

32:27.146 --> 32:28.478
Stay with us! Stay with us!

32:28.480 --> 32:30.113
He's bleeding out.

32:30.115 --> 32:32.683
<i>Where are you?</i> A kitchen.

32:32.685 --> 32:35.118
<i>Okay, good.
What kinda stove is it?</i>

32:35.120 --> 32:37.087
What? Why? Gas.

32:37.089 --> 32:39.456
<i>You can us it
to stop the bleeding.</i>

32:39.458 --> 32:41.725
There's gotta be another way.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.593
<i>Then let's hear it.</i>

32:43.595 --> 32:45.262
I have a few matches left.

32:45.264 --> 32:46.964
You'll kill him.

32:46.966 --> 32:50.233
- No, she's right...
- You gotta do it.

32:54.105 --> 32:55.639
Okay, let's go.

33:12.123 --> 33:13.991
Goddammit,
have a little faith...

33:15.694 --> 33:18.362
I'm not used to doing this
under such pressure.

33:22.667 --> 33:25.469
Nice... There you go.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.539
O lord, our god and savior...

33:30.775 --> 33:32.642
How 'bout something
that's actually gonna help?

33:32.644 --> 33:36.146
Grab some alcohol. Over there.

33:47.625 --> 33:50.527
"Make us strong..."

33:52.530 --> 33:54.131
C'mere.

33:55.400 --> 33:57.434
I'm gonna try and
pull my arm back.

33:57.436 --> 33:59.302
You gotta make sure that
doesn't happen, okay?

33:59.304 --> 34:00.737
Okay.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.053
Now?

34:18.824 --> 34:20.123
Now!!

34:24.129 --> 34:25.795
Shit...

34:29.301 --> 34:30.833
Oh, fuck!!

34:35.706 --> 34:37.373
One, two, three...

34:37.376 --> 34:40.243
<i>Everything okay? Henry?</i>

34:40.245 --> 34:42.379
Father, hold him up.

34:43.414 --> 34:44.848
<i>Henry?</i>

34:52.690 --> 34:54.391
<i>Warning...</i>

34:54.393 --> 34:58.862
<i>Backup generator operating
at 15 percent.</i>

35:00.766 --> 35:03.400
There is an escape.
We're almost there.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.271
It's got us
trapped in a hallway.

35:08.273 --> 35:10.140
My light's keeping
it back for now.

35:10.142 --> 35:12.375
Any ideas? <i>Get into a room.</i>

35:15.414 --> 35:16.713
Okay, there. This one.

35:19.318 --> 35:21.318
It's locked! Shit.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.786
Keep the light on him,

35:22.788 --> 35:24.888
then we'll get him back
slow and steady.

35:24.890 --> 35:26.423
Okay.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.428
What're you doing?

35:31.430 --> 35:32.863
We don't have much time.

35:32.865 --> 35:34.731
You're gonna
strand them in the dark.

35:34.733 --> 35:37.334
As long as his head lamp
is working, they'll be okay.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.735
You're gonna kill them!

35:38.737 --> 35:40.637
The light is their only chance.

35:41.739 --> 35:43.707
Tell them to get close together.

35:45.543 --> 35:47.611
<i>Marion's gonna
redirect the power.</i>

35:47.613 --> 35:49.913
<i>You have to hold tight
for a few seconds.</i>

35:49.915 --> 35:52.482
I don't think this light's
gonna last very much longer.

35:54.553 --> 35:57.587
<i>Thirty seconds, starting...</i>

35:57.589 --> 35:58.788
<i>now.</i>

36:04.529 --> 36:06.363
There's nothing to be afraid of.

36:06.365 --> 36:07.764
God is with us.

36:07.766 --> 36:11.201
I've stared death
in the eye before.

36:11.203 --> 36:12.936
Stay hold of your courage.

36:19.878 --> 36:22.312
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

36:23.881 --> 36:25.482
Oh shit...

36:27.385 --> 36:29.619
<i>Five...</i>

36:29.621 --> 36:31.888
<i>Four...</i>

36:31.890 --> 36:34.491
<i>Three...</i>

36:34.493 --> 36:36.493
<i>Two...</i>

36:36.495 --> 36:37.928
<i>One.</i>

36:59.559 --> 37:00.618
What did you do?

37:00.619 --> 37:04.821
I got you full power by shutting
down the rest of the building.

37:04.823 --> 37:05.956
You're welcome.

37:05.958 --> 37:07.657
You trapped us in here.

37:07.659 --> 37:10.260
I'm sorry, but we haven't really
had a formal introduction.

37:10.262 --> 37:12.295
We're the people that just
saved your fucking life.

37:12.297 --> 37:13.730
Who the hell are you?

37:13.732 --> 37:15.865
He's a priest, and...
Who're you?

37:15.867 --> 37:17.434
I'm an intern. Intern.

37:17.436 --> 37:19.002
I need to get this wrapped up.

37:19.004 --> 37:20.537
I've got something.

37:23.908 --> 37:26.910
Holy shit... How are you awake?

37:26.912 --> 37:28.912
I... do you know
what happened to me?

37:28.914 --> 37:30.680
You don't have to answer that.

37:30.682 --> 37:32.015
What are you,
his fucking lawyer?

37:32.017 --> 37:33.617
What did you do to me?

37:33.619 --> 37:35.552
You're in a lotta danger.

37:35.554 --> 37:37.554
How long ago did
the contractions start?

37:37.556 --> 37:39.356
Uh... About an hour?

37:39.358 --> 37:42.459
Look, I don't want this baby,
so if you have to get rough...

37:42.461 --> 37:45.362
You have been chosen
for something.

37:46.430 --> 37:49.766
It's... A gift from god.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.903
Don't you start with me!

37:53.905 --> 37:55.705
If this baby is a gift,

37:55.707 --> 37:58.975
it better come with
a fucking return policy!

37:58.977 --> 38:02.045
It's not a...
It's not a baby, exactly.

38:09.754 --> 38:11.454
It's one of them, isn't it?

38:11.456 --> 38:13.390
One of those creatures?

38:14.458 --> 38:16.493
What did you do to me?

38:16.495 --> 38:18.628
We can ease the pain,

38:18.630 --> 38:20.397
but you're going to die.

38:20.399 --> 38:22.999
"Die?" That's not a gift.

38:23.001 --> 38:25.001
Listen, I've been
working on a procedure.

38:25.003 --> 38:28.605
It would've been against policy,
but there might be a chance.

38:28.607 --> 38:29.973
Okay, so do it!

38:31.075 --> 38:33.343
I need you to
take off your pants.

38:35.980 --> 38:38.515
Better be the best
goddam intern that ever lived.

38:38.517 --> 38:40.617
Well I'm the best goddamned
intern in this room,

38:40.619 --> 38:44.421
so... How 'bout that?

38:53.831 --> 38:55.098
Oh god.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.000
Okay, we need to
prepare for a c-section.

38:58.069 --> 38:59.869
Henry, write this down.

38:59.871 --> 39:02.339
There's a dispensary
down the hall, okay?

39:02.341 --> 39:03.640
There's three vials.

39:03.642 --> 39:06.509
For her pain, we need
the one labeled "h4x5,"

39:06.511 --> 39:08.411
and I wanna try
two experimental drugs,

39:08.413 --> 39:11.948
"h9d13" and, um, "c7x11."

39:11.950 --> 39:14.417
All of the mothers
died in birth.

39:14.419 --> 39:16.553
Don't give her false hope.

39:16.555 --> 39:19.489
That thing will kill
her for sure if we don't try.

39:19.491 --> 39:21.725
She's in god's hands now.
No, she's in mine.

39:21.727 --> 39:23.760
Please tell me
you're left-handed.

39:23.762 --> 39:25.495
Hey, lady, you're
making the incisions.

39:25.497 --> 39:26.596
What?

39:26.598 --> 39:27.931
Henry, to get to
the dispensary...

39:27.933 --> 39:28.965
Enough!

39:30.034 --> 39:32.001
You want someone to cut into me?

39:33.637 --> 39:35.605
Henry, Marion, come over here.

39:36.674 --> 39:38.775
Hold out your hands.

39:40.811 --> 39:42.078
Ah!

39:43.447 --> 39:44.981
He's doing it.

39:44.983 --> 39:47.450
No, I've never done
something like that before.

39:47.452 --> 39:49.519
I can't... look at me...

39:49.521 --> 39:51.121
Please!

39:51.123 --> 39:53.957
The last time someone needed me,
it didn't work out so well.

39:53.959 --> 39:56.393
Okay, well, now's your chance
to make up for it.

39:56.395 --> 39:57.761
I...

39:57.763 --> 40:00.964
"can." "I can."

40:00.966 --> 40:02.665
That's the only answer.

40:06.637 --> 40:08.037
I can.

40:09.039 --> 40:11.007
Good.

40:11.009 --> 40:13.009
Marion, you're
grabbing the drugs.

40:13.011 --> 40:14.577
Oh, now you trust me?

40:14.579 --> 40:16.446
No.

40:16.448 --> 40:18.415
But I need you.

40:21.018 --> 40:23.887
Okay, father Stewart can
take us to the dispensary.

40:23.889 --> 40:26.055
My job is here with god.

40:26.057 --> 40:28.691
Well, god called.

40:28.693 --> 40:30.760
He told you to
keep me company...

40:30.762 --> 40:32.629
And this.

40:52.650 --> 40:53.817
Shit.

40:57.855 --> 40:59.689
What's that?

40:59.691 --> 41:01.891
I'm looking for a keycard
with a level-a clearance.

41:01.893 --> 41:03.793
It'll get us through
the front gates.

41:03.795 --> 41:06.529
Only five people
down here had one.

41:37.161 --> 41:39.662
Well...

41:39.664 --> 41:42.232
This is about to get
very personal very quickly.

41:42.234 --> 41:43.633
Yeah.

41:43.635 --> 41:45.535
I won't make any jokes.

41:45.537 --> 41:47.170
I promise.

41:47.172 --> 41:49.772
We don't even
need to say anything.

42:01.886 --> 42:03.286
Who's hunter?

42:04.755 --> 42:06.689
Not even 30 seconds of silence.

42:06.691 --> 42:08.191
I'm nervous, okay?

42:08.193 --> 42:10.627
I write copy all day.
I don't cut into people.

42:13.631 --> 42:16.633
Ah, hunter is...

42:16.635 --> 42:18.134
my dog.

42:18.136 --> 42:19.869
Mm.

42:19.871 --> 42:23.039
You got your dog's name
tattooed on your wrist?

42:25.075 --> 42:26.876
Did you do that yourself?

42:28.045 --> 42:30.246
Car accident.

42:32.016 --> 42:35.318
Okay, so which one of us is
gonna tell the truth first?

42:46.897 --> 42:48.965
Hunter's my son.

42:50.701 --> 42:52.201
What about those?

42:56.106 --> 42:57.774
I answered your question.

42:57.776 --> 42:59.008
Scars?

42:59.010 --> 43:00.643
I told you, car accident.

43:00.645 --> 43:02.679
I was driving too fast
down the road...

43:02.681 --> 43:03.713
Bullshit.

43:05.249 --> 43:07.083
What's the truth?

43:12.856 --> 43:14.624
I was running
away from something

43:14.626 --> 43:16.626
and I couldn't get
far enough away.

43:18.696 --> 43:20.597
What were you running from?

43:35.779 --> 43:37.780
Hunter doesn't know
about the drugs.

43:40.250 --> 43:42.785
I can't let him find out.

43:45.789 --> 43:48.658
You shoulda let me tell
that car accident story.

43:48.660 --> 43:50.126
It's a lot better.

43:50.128 --> 43:53.963
It's got a twist ending,
tears...

43:53.965 --> 43:56.666
It's good.

44:01.672 --> 44:03.973
We're gonna get you
back to your son,

44:03.975 --> 44:06.175
I promise.

44:07.711 --> 44:10.380
Can I get your hundred-percent
cool guy guarantee on that?

44:19.423 --> 44:23.359
Chris...

44:26.296 --> 44:28.831
Chris was one of our team.

44:33.437 --> 44:37.106
If I confess something to you,
you can't tell anyone, right?

44:37.108 --> 44:39.442
That's correct.

44:41.278 --> 44:43.913
And you'll forgive anything?

44:43.915 --> 44:46.215
Whatever needs to be forgiven.

44:53.057 --> 44:54.457
Forget it.

44:56.427 --> 44:59.128
What do you need to confess?

45:03.200 --> 45:05.435
How old do you think I am?

45:05.437 --> 45:08.838
My uncle always said,
"never speak a lady's age."

45:10.374 --> 45:12.341
Well, I'm almost 50.

45:13.377 --> 45:16.245
I've spent my entire life

45:16.247 --> 45:19.182
being somebody's lackey.

45:19.184 --> 45:22.885
Do you have any idea
what it's like

45:22.887 --> 45:25.988
to be ignored for
almost 50 fuckin' years?

45:25.990 --> 45:29.926
Well, a priest is hardly
the life of the party.

45:34.765 --> 45:37.333
For once I didn't want
to be that person

45:37.335 --> 45:39.869
watching life pass them by.

45:41.105 --> 45:43.172
I wanted the headlines...

45:44.908 --> 45:46.309
What did you do?

45:49.947 --> 45:51.414
I let them out.

45:55.152 --> 45:57.120
You started this?

45:58.155 --> 46:00.823
I knew about the cages,

46:00.825 --> 46:05.228
and I thought it was some
kind of illegal animal testing.

46:06.463 --> 46:09.499
I made sure the backup
generator wouldn't kick in,

46:09.501 --> 46:12.368
I shut down the power,
the cages opened, and...

46:12.370 --> 46:16.205
And the screaming started.

46:17.474 --> 46:19.976
I tried to get
the power back on,

46:19.978 --> 46:21.310
but it wouldn't work,

46:21.312 --> 46:24.413
and the doctors came in,
and there was...

46:24.415 --> 46:26.449
So much blood.

46:29.319 --> 46:31.287
And I just ran and hid.

46:36.527 --> 46:39.328
What is the point
of forgiveness anyways?

46:39.330 --> 46:41.130
You don't see it, do you?

46:41.132 --> 46:42.832
Now what does that mean?

46:42.834 --> 46:45.835
It means there's
a larger plan at work.

46:45.837 --> 46:48.838
Bullshit... people are
dead because of me!

46:48.840 --> 46:51.007
Not because god had some plan.

46:51.009 --> 46:53.509
We are all puppets
on god's stage.

46:53.511 --> 46:56.512
Our paths are
already laid for us.

46:58.482 --> 47:01.851
So, you know my path, huh?

47:01.853 --> 47:04.287
That's what we're waiting
to find out, isn't it?

47:04.289 --> 47:05.822
How about these?

47:12.931 --> 47:14.564
People with "a" clearance

47:14.566 --> 47:16.232
wouldn't be caught dead in here.

47:16.234 --> 47:18.134
Pardon the pun.

47:20.003 --> 47:23.306
Wait, what were
you doing in here?

47:25.542 --> 47:28.177
Holy shit.

47:28.179 --> 47:31.147
Holy shit!

47:31.149 --> 47:33.249
We can make our own cards.

47:33.251 --> 47:36.285
Chris was trying
to re-code the cards

47:36.287 --> 47:38.054
to get through the front gate.

47:38.056 --> 47:39.388
Brilliant.

47:43.227 --> 47:45.161
It's taking too long.

47:55.340 --> 47:57.506
We need those
god damned drugs...

47:57.508 --> 48:00.142
And something to cut with.

48:00.144 --> 48:03.112
I have a scalpel in my pocket.

48:04.514 --> 48:06.148
Put it over the flame.

48:06.150 --> 48:07.483
Get the hell back here!

48:11.989 --> 48:13.122
Did you hear that?

48:13.124 --> 48:14.557
I've almost got this.

48:14.559 --> 48:16.292
I've just got to get
the servers online

48:16.294 --> 48:18.394
to access the key card database.

48:25.669 --> 48:27.470
That's not good.

48:27.472 --> 48:28.638
What did you do?

48:28.640 --> 48:30.640
Oh, shit.

48:30.642 --> 48:32.575
You can turn the lights
back on, right?

48:32.577 --> 48:34.176
In order to
activate the servers,

48:34.178 --> 48:36.312
I had to put them on
the lighting grid.

48:36.314 --> 48:37.947
I accidentally
overloaded the circuit!

48:51.962 --> 48:54.530
I've got the last one.
We must leave.

48:54.532 --> 48:57.166
I can fix this from here.
I just need another minute.

48:59.604 --> 49:01.570
Something's inside.

49:31.635 --> 49:33.035
Help me.

49:38.475 --> 49:39.675
There's nothing I can...

49:39.677 --> 49:41.110
Please, you can't leave me here.

49:53.457 --> 49:55.458
Did you get the bag?

49:56.493 --> 49:58.194
Where's Marion?

50:02.265 --> 50:03.766
The light's are out everywhere.

50:03.768 --> 50:05.067
Where's Marion?

50:05.069 --> 50:08.204
She's dead.

50:08.206 --> 50:10.706
Dead?

50:10.708 --> 50:12.742
Help me get this stuff
out of the bag.

50:12.744 --> 50:16.312
Okay, what do you need?
What am I looking for?

50:16.314 --> 50:19.115
Okay, here, take
the scissors over there.

50:19.117 --> 50:21.217
Okay.

50:25.555 --> 50:27.156
Does anybody else hear that?

50:34.464 --> 50:37.133
We don't take
the lord's name in vain.

50:37.135 --> 50:40.269
The devil has got you, boy,
but I'm going to cleanse you.

50:40.271 --> 50:42.772
<i>I'm sorry, uncle Peter!
I didn't mean to say it!</i>

50:42.774 --> 50:45.141
This isn't an act of hate.

50:45.143 --> 50:48.044
God is a cruel master...

50:48.046 --> 50:49.712
But through pain,

50:49.714 --> 50:52.281
he shows us his love.

51:05.162 --> 51:07.096
What's wrong with him?

51:08.231 --> 51:10.299
Father, can you
fill these syringes?

51:10.301 --> 51:11.667
Give them to me.

51:13.537 --> 51:15.571
Are you sure you know
how to do this?

51:15.573 --> 51:17.540
Trust me.

51:39.830 --> 51:42.565
This one will help
with the pain.

51:52.844 --> 51:55.344
Get it all out...

51:55.346 --> 51:57.713
Get it all out.

51:57.715 --> 52:00.416
Your life was in
god's hands for a minute.

52:00.418 --> 52:03.819
He must have sent you
back for a reason.

52:03.821 --> 52:07.723
We can't predict
god's plan for us,

52:07.725 --> 52:11.227
but someday

52:11.229 --> 52:13.229
it will make sense.

52:21.738 --> 52:24.206
What happened?
I was on the beach...

52:30.180 --> 52:32.781
Once I start this I don't
know what's going to happen.

52:32.783 --> 52:34.783
Okay, you could...

52:34.785 --> 52:37.486
Henry.

52:37.488 --> 52:39.421
We have to start cutting,
can you handle it?

52:39.423 --> 52:40.689
Yeah...

52:54.172 --> 52:55.337
Hey...

53:13.924 --> 53:16.592
Holy shit.

53:24.769 --> 53:26.869
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

53:29.239 --> 53:31.573
Okay, Ellie, we're going to
administer the other two drugs.

53:31.575 --> 53:32.741
Now, based on my theories...

53:32.743 --> 53:34.476
No, don't give me the specifics.

53:39.783 --> 53:41.550
You're doing good,
you're doing good.

53:41.552 --> 53:43.752
Last one.

53:59.971 --> 54:02.705
We've got to get to
the next layer of tissue.

54:02.707 --> 54:04.974
Cut there. Take it slow.

54:04.976 --> 54:07.509
One more layer.

54:07.511 --> 54:08.677
Hold on, not too far, Henry!

54:08.679 --> 54:10.946
God, what do I do?
Grab the scissors.

54:10.948 --> 54:12.648
Open the god damned door!

54:13.750 --> 54:15.618
I thought you said she was dead.

54:15.620 --> 54:18.287
Henry, focus... I need you
in here with the scissors now!

54:18.289 --> 54:19.888
Open the door!

54:26.264 --> 54:27.763
We can't stop, Henry.
Keep going!

54:27.765 --> 54:29.865
Ellie, Ellie!
Stay with me! Look at me!

54:35.506 --> 54:37.606
No, you can't stop now.

54:37.608 --> 54:40.476
Finish cutting that layer.
Let's go.

54:43.481 --> 54:45.648
No, focus, Henry!

54:45.650 --> 54:47.549
Grab the scissors.
Grab the scalpel.

54:48.885 --> 54:50.653
Kill it!

54:53.958 --> 54:55.557
Ellie, don't look at that.

55:00.330 --> 55:01.330
Somebody kill that bitch!

55:04.935 --> 55:06.802
Focus!

55:07.837 --> 55:09.505
Put the scissors down.

55:09.507 --> 55:11.473
It's coming.
I have to pull it out.

55:11.475 --> 55:13.709
I don't wanna see it
when you pull it out.

55:13.711 --> 55:15.411
Now, Henry!

55:15.413 --> 55:17.479
It's coming! Now!

55:17.481 --> 55:20.082
Pull it out or she dies!
Pull it out!

55:37.568 --> 55:39.001
Put it down!

55:46.110 --> 55:48.811
Holy shit...

56:19.676 --> 56:21.944
What the fuck.

56:21.946 --> 56:24.613
Um, a little help?

56:31.421 --> 56:33.455
Is it dead?

56:33.457 --> 56:36.425
Uh, yeah. It's dead.

56:41.765 --> 56:43.499
How are you?

56:43.501 --> 56:46.502
I'm alive.

56:46.504 --> 56:49.805
Son of a bitch, we did it.

56:52.075 --> 56:53.675
Did I get it?

56:53.677 --> 56:55.677
You left me to die.

56:55.679 --> 56:57.746
We had no choice.

56:57.748 --> 57:00.015
I had to get her the medicine.

57:00.017 --> 57:02.551
Bullshit. You fucking left me!

57:02.553 --> 57:03.886
Please stop!

57:03.888 --> 57:05.587
You need to sew her up.

57:07.023 --> 57:08.991
Can you feel anything?

57:08.993 --> 57:11.927
It's sore,
but it should be worse.

57:11.929 --> 57:13.829
The drugs I gave you will help,

57:13.831 --> 57:16.131
but you're not gonna
be moving fast, okay?

57:16.133 --> 57:19.501
Okay, you want to tell us
what just fucking happened here?

57:19.503 --> 57:21.703
We still have to get
out of here, alright?

57:21.705 --> 57:24.640
It would be helpful to know
what we are dealing with.

57:24.642 --> 57:26.108
We didn't know
this would happen.

57:26.110 --> 57:27.810
Don't tell them anything.

57:27.812 --> 57:29.812
Who are you even
protecting anymore?

57:29.814 --> 57:32.481
This is the only way
to get out of here.

57:32.483 --> 57:34.483
If you want to waste time
answering questions,

57:34.485 --> 57:35.984
then I won't stop you.

57:35.986 --> 57:38.654
You took the time to save
the cards, just not me.

57:38.656 --> 57:40.856
What is this place?

57:40.858 --> 57:43.492
It's a privately-
funded research facility.

57:43.494 --> 57:45.127
Studying what?

57:45.129 --> 57:46.995
Death.

57:46.997 --> 57:49.698
By the looks of it,
you guys did a lotta studying.

57:51.835 --> 57:54.203
Ellie, what's the last
thing you remember

57:54.205 --> 57:55.971
before waking up here?

57:55.973 --> 57:59.708
I was running out
into the street.

58:01.211 --> 58:03.178
You were in pain?

58:03.180 --> 58:05.981
Yeah, I couldn't breathe,
my heart was pounding.

58:05.983 --> 58:08.484
You overdosed,
you had a heart attack.

58:08.486 --> 58:10.886
You were dead when the company
brought your body.

58:14.190 --> 58:15.958
That's impossible.

58:15.960 --> 58:18.827
When someone dies, their brain
doesn't shut off all at once.

58:18.829 --> 58:21.263
We discovered if we apply

58:21.265 --> 58:23.732
specific electrical frequencies

58:23.734 --> 58:26.802
to the area of the brain
that stores our memories,

58:26.804 --> 58:28.036
the brain would re-ignite.

58:28.038 --> 58:32.808
So you used my body
for a science project?

58:32.810 --> 58:36.245
This might be the first step
towards reversing death.

58:36.247 --> 58:38.514
How did I get pregnant?

58:39.883 --> 58:41.617
We first tested on a woman.

58:41.619 --> 58:44.019
When she came back,
all her vital signs were normal.

58:44.021 --> 58:46.588
Until we realized
she was pregnant.

58:46.590 --> 58:48.156
We tried again and again.

58:48.158 --> 58:49.958
All the women came
back pregnant.

58:49.960 --> 58:51.894
This doesn't make any sense.

58:51.896 --> 58:54.596
Where do these things come from?

58:54.598 --> 58:57.799
We don't have
a scientific explanation.

58:57.801 --> 59:00.035
That's why I'm here.

59:00.037 --> 59:03.038
Because science can't
handle these questions.

59:03.040 --> 59:04.740
But we can't prove your theory.

59:04.742 --> 59:08.176
Memory is a gateway
to the other side.

59:08.178 --> 59:11.113
A collective unconscious
ties us all together

59:11.115 --> 59:13.115
with everyone who lives

59:13.117 --> 59:16.018
and who has ever lived.

59:16.020 --> 59:17.853
Life death...

59:17.855 --> 59:19.922
Positive negative.

59:19.924 --> 59:22.024
You reached into the afterlife

59:22.026 --> 59:24.059
and brought back a hitchhiker,

59:24.061 --> 59:27.963
a divine creature, sent by god,

59:27.965 --> 59:30.866
to be reborn into this world.

59:30.868 --> 59:32.301
It's nonsense.

59:32.303 --> 59:35.938
No, maybe he's right.

59:35.940 --> 59:37.205
I've been having visions.

59:37.207 --> 59:38.874
Visions?

59:38.876 --> 59:41.276
It's like I'm experiencing
people's deaths.

59:41.278 --> 59:45.080
It's like I'm there,
I feel everything they did.

59:45.082 --> 59:47.282
You're the first man
we've brought back.

59:47.284 --> 59:49.251
We put you in quarantine.

59:49.253 --> 59:50.886
We didn't know
what would happen.

59:50.888 --> 59:54.890
Hold on, so I come back
with that thing inside me

59:54.892 --> 59:58.594
and what, he gets
a few bad memories?

59:58.596 --> 01:00:00.062
What else?

01:00:00.064 --> 01:00:02.064
The next part
doesn't make sense.

01:00:02.066 --> 01:00:03.899
You were there.

01:00:03.901 --> 01:00:06.969
You were on a beach
with your uncle

01:00:06.971 --> 01:00:10.005
and he said
god is a cruel master.

01:00:10.007 --> 01:00:12.341
Through pain he shows love.

01:00:12.343 --> 01:00:14.242
How can you know that...

01:00:14.244 --> 01:00:17.179
I complete the circle don't I?

01:00:17.181 --> 01:00:21.016
Through her, they're
reaching out into our world.

01:00:21.018 --> 01:00:22.884
And I'm reaching
out into theirs.

01:00:22.886 --> 01:00:25.053
Guys? It's gone.

01:00:27.223 --> 01:00:28.857
What the hell?

01:00:33.096 --> 01:00:35.130
But, you slit its throat.

01:00:35.132 --> 01:00:36.965
You can't kill
something that's already dead.

01:00:38.101 --> 01:00:39.735
But the baby died.

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:49.244
We used all the candles.

01:00:57.987 --> 01:00:59.955
How do I tie this off?

01:00:59.957 --> 01:01:01.189
Well, okay three loops.

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:06.662
One, two, three.

01:01:06.664 --> 01:01:07.896
Okay, how's that?

01:01:07.898 --> 01:01:09.258
A little tighter,
a little tighter.

01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:19.207
They're in the vents.

01:01:19.209 --> 01:01:21.276
Okay, the sun goes
down in 45 minutes,

01:01:21.278 --> 01:01:24.312
let's get to the front gate
and come up with another plan.

01:01:24.314 --> 01:01:26.014
That's a great idea,

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:28.250
when I had it an hour ago!

01:01:28.252 --> 01:01:29.751
Doc!

01:01:29.753 --> 01:01:31.086
The drugs...

01:01:31.088 --> 01:01:33.422
No, I have the pills
in my back pocket!

01:01:33.424 --> 01:01:36.324
No, the vials.
They worked to kill the baby.

01:01:36.326 --> 01:01:37.993
Ellie, we must go.

01:01:37.995 --> 01:01:40.062
Just wait for him. Wait!

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:44.766
Come on.

01:01:44.768 --> 01:01:46.935
They're our only chance.

01:01:46.937 --> 01:01:48.170
Hurry, they're coming.

01:01:48.172 --> 01:01:49.705
One more.

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:55.043
We must go now!

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:56.178
Hold on!

01:01:58.748 --> 01:02:00.148
I got it!

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:05.854
No!

01:02:08.825 --> 01:02:10.058
Come on.

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:43.959
Right back to square one.

01:02:56.973 --> 01:02:58.840
Oh my god!

01:03:00.076 --> 01:03:02.811
We can just close it!
We can shut them in here!

01:03:02.813 --> 01:03:05.213
Why didn't you tell anyone
you had that card?

01:03:05.215 --> 01:03:07.048
Give it to me.

01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:09.518
I have to finish
what you started.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:12.154
The ending's so clear to me now.

01:03:12.156 --> 01:03:13.922
You must see it too.

01:03:13.924 --> 01:03:16.358
The moment you
opened those cages...

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:18.360
It was an accident.

01:03:18.362 --> 01:03:20.996
She's just been dragging us
around, cleaning up your mess.

01:03:20.998 --> 01:03:23.532
Do you think that I had
any idea this would happen?

01:03:23.534 --> 01:03:26.001
I dunno, did you think about
anyone other than yourself?

01:03:26.003 --> 01:03:28.003
No! No! Why?

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:34.342
We've strayed so far
from his path.

01:03:34.344 --> 01:03:36.912
The world has forgotten
morality and decency.

01:03:36.914 --> 01:03:38.580
Look at you...

01:03:38.582 --> 01:03:42.083
You spent your life
searching for your next high.

01:03:42.085 --> 01:03:44.920
You let envy consume you.

01:03:46.889 --> 01:03:48.990
And you... Worst of all.

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:53.829
God gave you the gift of life,
and you threw it away.

01:03:53.831 --> 01:03:56.865
And that's why he's making you
relive those deaths.

01:03:56.867 --> 01:03:58.200
He's punishing you.

01:03:58.202 --> 01:04:01.403
Through pain,
god shows us his love.

01:04:01.405 --> 01:04:04.539
I haven't heard those words
in so many years...

01:04:04.541 --> 01:04:07.442
He's telling me what to do.

01:04:07.444 --> 01:04:10.212
We can rebuild the world,

01:04:10.214 --> 01:04:13.148
but first we have to destroy it.

01:04:15.251 --> 01:04:17.319
Behold the lord
cometh out of this place,

01:04:17.321 --> 01:04:19.387
to punish the inhabitants...

01:04:24.493 --> 01:04:26.428
It won't close.

01:04:28.431 --> 01:04:30.498
So tomorrow morning
when the sun comes up,

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:33.001
won't it just fry those
fucking things?

01:04:33.003 --> 01:04:35.237
No, the light just
causes them pain.

01:04:35.239 --> 01:04:37.472
And they heal fast.
You saw that thing.

01:04:37.474 --> 01:04:39.941
They can't die,
once they're out,

01:04:39.943 --> 01:04:42.143
they'll just spread
from town to town.

01:04:45.983 --> 01:04:48.216
Oh, I am so sorry.

01:04:53.522 --> 01:04:55.957
Ellie.

01:04:55.959 --> 01:04:58.293
Hey.

01:04:58.295 --> 01:05:00.662
Ellie.

01:05:03.032 --> 01:05:06.468
Ellie. Ellie.

01:05:07.937 --> 01:05:11.072
<i>Hello, who is this?</i>

01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:12.540
Hunter, it's mom.

01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:14.309
<i>That's not funny.</i>

01:05:14.311 --> 01:05:15.977
<i>My mom's dead.</i>

01:05:15.979 --> 01:05:18.013
I know they told you
I was gone, but honey,

01:05:18.015 --> 01:05:20.415
I'm right here and you
need to listen to me,

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:22.317
okay something really bad
is about to happen

01:05:22.319 --> 01:05:25.086
so you need to get your...

01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:26.922
No...

01:05:26.924 --> 01:05:28.423
No, no, no, no, no.

01:05:31.194 --> 01:05:32.560
Hey.

01:05:32.562 --> 01:05:34.029
No.

01:05:53.316 --> 01:05:55.150
Hey, Ellie.

01:05:55.152 --> 01:05:56.418
Where are you going?

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:05.093
Mom, I think I know
where my phone is.

01:06:09.065 --> 01:06:10.699
Mom? Get up, mom.

01:06:18.274 --> 01:06:19.507
Ellie.

01:06:19.509 --> 01:06:21.409
He can't survive without me.

01:06:21.411 --> 01:06:23.545
You'll never make it.
There's not enough time.

01:06:23.547 --> 01:06:25.981
They're going to kill him!
Oh, fuck!

01:06:29.251 --> 01:06:30.752
Enough!

01:06:30.754 --> 01:06:33.655
I'm not a fucking junkie, okay?

01:06:35.358 --> 01:06:37.325
Everyone must've told him by now

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:39.861
I'm just a strung-out loser who
abandoned him for another fix,

01:06:39.863 --> 01:06:41.663
but I'm not...
I'm not that person.

01:06:41.665 --> 01:06:45.266
And if I don't get back to him,
that's all I'll ever be to him.

01:06:45.268 --> 01:06:47.035
No, he knows
you're more than that.

01:06:47.037 --> 01:06:49.204
But that's all he's
gonna remember me as.

01:06:49.206 --> 01:06:51.006
Ellie, he was there.

01:06:51.008 --> 01:06:53.675
He came back for his
phone that day.

01:06:53.677 --> 01:06:55.677
Get up mom.

01:06:57.146 --> 01:06:58.146
Mom?

01:06:58.148 --> 01:07:00.081
It's okay.

01:07:02.718 --> 01:07:05.120
I'll take care of you.

01:07:05.122 --> 01:07:07.489
You don't need to
take care of me.

01:07:07.491 --> 01:07:10.258
I always do.

01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:13.361
What do you mean?

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:16.164
I know about your secret.

01:07:16.166 --> 01:07:20.435
I'm always looking out for you.

01:07:20.437 --> 01:07:24.039
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

01:07:24.041 --> 01:07:26.574
It's okay.

01:07:30.112 --> 01:07:31.713
I'm so sorry.

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:47.362
Ellie, this whole time
he was taking care of you.

01:07:47.364 --> 01:07:51.099
Fuck, I just never
did anything right.

01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:54.636
It doesn't matter what happened,

01:07:54.638 --> 01:07:57.338
you just have to be there
for him right now.

01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:59.340
Hunter will be okay,

01:07:59.342 --> 01:08:01.342
but only if we keep those
things behind that gate.

01:08:03.179 --> 01:08:05.346
Do you think that we
still have a chance?

01:08:05.348 --> 01:08:07.515
Once the sun sets,
we won't have any chance.

01:08:07.517 --> 01:08:09.784
But I think one good choice
can save his life,

01:08:09.786 --> 01:08:11.519
whether he knows it or not.

01:08:19.194 --> 01:08:21.328
I just need one.

01:08:21.331 --> 01:08:23.363
Just one for the pain.

01:08:26.268 --> 01:08:27.502
Okay.

01:08:42.853 --> 01:08:44.319
Ready?

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:06.374
Marion, how do we fix this?

01:09:06.376 --> 01:09:08.710
I don't know.

01:09:08.712 --> 01:09:10.845
What about the drugs?
Were there more?

01:09:10.846 --> 01:09:13.515
Nope. That was it.

01:09:13.517 --> 01:09:16.451
Okay, what about the generator?
What can we do with that?

01:09:16.453 --> 01:09:17.919
Nothing.

01:09:17.921 --> 01:09:20.622
If we could get the lights on
for a little longer,

01:09:20.624 --> 01:09:22.323
it'll buy us some time.

01:09:22.325 --> 01:09:24.492
I tripped the overload device
on the lighting circuit.

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:27.362
The only way to get the lights
up and running is to

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:28.897
walk down there
and flip the breaker.

01:09:28.899 --> 01:09:30.564
That's not nothing.

01:09:30.567 --> 01:09:32.500
If we go in there, we all die.

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:33.935
We can't fight them.

01:09:33.937 --> 01:09:36.770
Okay, then what else does
the emergency systems control?

01:09:36.773 --> 01:09:40.441
Heating, ventilation...

01:09:40.443 --> 01:09:42.577
How do you kill something
that can't die?

01:09:44.212 --> 01:09:45.947
You don't...

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:47.916
You can only slow it down.

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:56.457
This entire
facility's underground.

01:09:56.459 --> 01:09:58.359
This is the only exit.

01:09:58.361 --> 01:10:01.196
Okay, so if we
blow up this entrance,

01:10:01.198 --> 01:10:03.231
then we trap them in here.

01:10:03.233 --> 01:10:05.300
Yeah, but we would
need explosives.

01:10:05.302 --> 01:10:07.302
I don't know where to get...

01:10:07.304 --> 01:10:09.671
Where to get those
except wait a minute...

01:10:09.673 --> 01:10:11.272
The heating system.

01:10:11.274 --> 01:10:14.242
It's an old boiler.

01:10:14.244 --> 01:10:16.211
We might not be able
to blow up the entrance,

01:10:16.213 --> 01:10:18.713
but we can blow up
the entire building.

01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:21.249
Bury these fuckers alive.

01:10:21.251 --> 01:10:22.350
They aren't alive.

01:10:28.657 --> 01:10:31.392
Okay, good, these will
get me to the generator.

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:33.428
I flip the transfer switch
and reroute the power

01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:35.296
to the boiler room.

01:10:35.298 --> 01:10:38.466
Now there, if we can increase
the pressure on the tank...

01:10:38.468 --> 01:10:40.335
"Boom!"

01:10:43.639 --> 01:10:45.240
Alright,
but we've got a problem.

01:10:45.242 --> 01:10:46.574
The generator is under a wing,

01:10:46.576 --> 01:10:48.409
but the boiler is under d wing.

01:10:48.411 --> 01:10:50.378
You two have to
make it to the boiler.

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:51.946
I don't know how much
fuel is left,

01:10:51.948 --> 01:10:54.382
and those pumps are gonna
suck a lot of power,

01:10:54.384 --> 01:10:55.783
so you won't have much time.

01:10:55.785 --> 01:10:57.819
But you can't go there alone.

01:10:57.821 --> 01:11:00.722
What, are you
gonna come with me?

01:11:02.324 --> 01:11:03.891
Look, it has to be me.

01:11:03.893 --> 01:11:06.394
I've gotta at least
try to make this right.

01:11:08.664 --> 01:11:10.732
Okay well, we need
weapons and flashlights.

01:11:33.689 --> 01:11:35.790
You know where you're going?

01:11:38.927 --> 01:11:40.662
We'll meet you back here, right?

01:11:40.664 --> 01:11:43.831
Yeah, sure.

01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:48.036
Good luck.

01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:55.810
We ready for this?

01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:58.313
It's okay to say
I'm not sure, right?

01:11:59.915 --> 01:12:01.883
Let's do it.

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:01.042
This isn't so bad.

01:13:01.044 --> 01:13:03.378
Maybe they're full?

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:04.946
It's just over there, right?

01:13:12.055 --> 01:13:13.688
Find somewhere to hide!

01:13:13.690 --> 01:13:15.857
What're you doing?
Where are you going?

01:13:15.859 --> 01:13:17.658
C'mon, you motherfuckers!

01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:20.161
Want some blood?!
Want some fresh meat?!

01:13:20.163 --> 01:13:21.996
Let's go! C'mon!

01:13:21.998 --> 01:13:23.765
Come and get me!

01:13:23.767 --> 01:13:25.500
I've got blood for you!

01:13:25.502 --> 01:13:27.001
You hungry?

01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:54.162
Back off!

01:14:18.588 --> 01:14:20.455
I've had a very long day.

01:14:20.457 --> 01:14:21.789
Don't piss me off.

01:14:23.026 --> 01:14:25.193
Oh, shit.

01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:33.468
You think I'm nothing?

01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:35.570
You think you can
walk all over me?

01:14:35.572 --> 01:14:37.905
Fuck you!

01:15:20.949 --> 01:15:23.551
It's you and me,
you son of a bitch.

01:15:40.569 --> 01:15:42.169
Henry?

01:15:46.275 --> 01:15:48.009
Henry?

01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:41.329
Rerouting the power.

01:16:44.199 --> 01:16:45.633
Now!

01:17:04.086 --> 01:17:05.252
Now!

01:17:07.255 --> 01:17:09.123
C'mon...

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:11.258
C'mon!

01:17:57.006 --> 01:17:58.205
Henry!

01:18:20.096 --> 01:18:21.762
How did you do that?

01:18:21.764 --> 01:18:24.298
My blood,
it's like they want it,

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:26.200
but it's like some
kind of poison...

01:18:26.202 --> 01:18:28.002
It kills them.

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:34.175
Of course. The drugs.
The intern's drugs.

01:18:34.177 --> 01:18:36.443
They're still in your blood.
Why didn't we think of that?

01:18:36.445 --> 01:18:38.479
Oh shit.

01:18:38.481 --> 01:18:40.915
So, we do have some drugs left.

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:44.051
Okay we, we cover
everything in blood.

01:18:45.787 --> 01:18:47.755
We need to get to Marion.

01:18:47.757 --> 01:18:50.291
This could help her.
We've gotta get down there.

01:18:56.131 --> 01:18:58.099
There's only a few minutes
till the sun goes down.

01:19:06.108 --> 01:19:08.109
<i>The boiler has power.</i>

01:19:08.111 --> 01:19:11.145
<i>Turn it up full and it'll blow.</i>

01:19:11.147 --> 01:19:13.414
The power won't last long.

01:19:13.416 --> 01:19:15.116
<i>You'll have to hurry.</i>

01:19:16.885 --> 01:19:18.786
<i>Get back to the diesel.</i>

01:19:18.788 --> 01:19:21.021
<i>If the boiler shuts down,</i>

01:19:21.023 --> 01:19:22.923
it won't start up again.

01:19:25.961 --> 01:19:29.063
I wish I could join you,

01:19:29.065 --> 01:19:31.899
it's just not looking good.

01:19:38.874 --> 01:19:41.208
I want to give people
a reason to remember me.

01:19:42.878 --> 01:19:44.478
I won't be here
to read the headlines.

01:19:47.282 --> 01:19:48.916
<i>Just send them
back to hell for me.</i>

01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:35.830
Son of a bitch.

01:20:35.832 --> 01:20:37.031
You don't have to do this.

01:20:37.033 --> 01:20:38.299
I'm sorry you don't understand.

01:20:38.301 --> 01:20:40.901
God saved me for this.

01:20:40.903 --> 01:20:42.303
A god that asks you to kill?

01:20:42.305 --> 01:20:45.573
You need to have faith.

01:20:45.575 --> 01:20:47.374
I do.

01:20:47.376 --> 01:20:49.176
Do you?

01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:51.445
How did you die Henry?

01:20:51.447 --> 01:20:53.514
You relived our deaths,

01:20:53.516 --> 01:20:55.449
what about yours?

01:20:55.451 --> 01:20:58.252
Have you been fighting it
all this time?

01:21:00.623 --> 01:21:02.323
The knife cutting
through your flesh.

01:21:02.325 --> 01:21:04.291
Do you remember how it felt?

01:21:04.293 --> 01:21:07.528
How many cuts did it take?

01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:09.396
Stop it.

01:21:09.398 --> 01:21:11.198
Let it in.

01:21:27.415 --> 01:21:30.017
I couldn't live with the guilt.

01:21:30.019 --> 01:21:32.419
She was diagnosed with
cancer and I left.

01:21:32.421 --> 01:21:34.355
She died alone.

01:21:34.357 --> 01:21:36.891
Is that what you
want to hear father?

01:21:36.893 --> 01:21:39.126
Don't, please.

01:21:39.128 --> 01:21:41.595
You don't have to do this.
You can come with us.

01:21:41.597 --> 01:21:43.964
All it takes
is one right choice.

01:21:49.971 --> 01:21:52.306
But I don't have a choice.

01:21:57.679 --> 01:21:59.146
No!

01:21:59.148 --> 01:22:01.982
No, please!
Don't turn off the boiler!

01:22:01.984 --> 01:22:03.617
No, please don't.

01:22:03.619 --> 01:22:06.453
We have to restart it.

01:22:06.455 --> 01:22:08.355
We can't there's no fuel.

01:22:13.329 --> 01:22:15.496
Please!

01:22:15.498 --> 01:22:18.065
There's too many of them.

01:22:37.987 --> 01:22:41.121
Let's go.

01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:43.324
Okay, just give me a second.

01:22:43.326 --> 01:22:46.226
Ellie, please,
this is our last chance.

01:22:46.228 --> 01:22:48.729
They're addicted to blood.

01:22:48.731 --> 01:22:50.464
What are you saying?

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.034
I'm the only thing
that kills them.

01:23:24.467 --> 01:23:25.733
Ellie.

01:23:33.241 --> 01:23:35.075
You'll bleed to death.

01:23:37.113 --> 01:23:38.679
Hunter...

01:23:38.681 --> 01:23:41.715
I've got to do everything
I can for him, don't I?

01:23:43.084 --> 01:23:44.485
Not this.

01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:48.522
We already had
our shot out there.

01:23:48.524 --> 01:23:51.525
If this our last chance
to do something right,

01:23:51.527 --> 01:23:53.627
I've got to take it.

01:23:59.267 --> 01:24:02.102
When you die,
how long does the pain last?

01:24:02.104 --> 01:24:04.171
Only a moment.

01:24:06.474 --> 01:24:08.642
That's not the part
that hurts, though.

01:24:08.644 --> 01:24:11.612
It's what you think about
right before it happens.

01:24:21.623 --> 01:24:23.457
You have to go.

01:24:26.428 --> 01:24:28.395
I don't need your help.

01:24:28.397 --> 01:24:30.431
I can do this on my own.

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:35.335
Hey. Look at me.

01:24:36.838 --> 01:24:39.640
This is my 100% everything's
cool guarantee, okay?

01:24:39.642 --> 01:24:42.276
That means everything's
gonna be fine.

01:24:42.278 --> 01:24:44.278
Hunter's going to
wake up tomorrow

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:46.346
because of what
you're doing today.

01:24:46.348 --> 01:24:48.415
He's going to go to school.

01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:50.117
Yeah...

01:24:50.119 --> 01:24:53.353
He's going to graduate,
get married...

01:24:53.355 --> 01:24:55.322
He's going to have a family.

01:24:55.324 --> 01:24:57.591
He'll grow up to be
an amazing parent,

01:24:57.593 --> 01:24:59.126
just like his mom.

01:24:59.128 --> 01:25:01.762
You're good at telling stories.

01:25:09.737 --> 01:25:11.271
Tell me my story.

01:25:15.577 --> 01:25:17.811
You and hunter
get a fresh start.

01:25:17.813 --> 01:25:20.414
You meet someone amazing.

01:25:20.416 --> 01:25:22.816
Someone like you?

01:25:22.818 --> 01:25:25.652
No one's ever called me
amazing before.

01:25:25.654 --> 01:25:27.454
Don't get used to it.

01:25:28.890 --> 01:25:31.291
Told ya I'd get
a smile outta ya.

01:25:37.866 --> 01:25:39.566
Go.

01:25:39.568 --> 01:25:41.135
Please.

01:25:43.671 --> 01:25:46.140
No, not again.

01:25:46.142 --> 01:25:47.908
You'll die.

01:25:51.779 --> 01:25:54.715
I just wanted to be known
as someone who helps people.

01:25:56.484 --> 01:25:58.185
Me too.

01:25:59.487 --> 01:26:01.288
You do?

01:26:06.694 --> 01:26:08.695
I just wanted...

01:26:10.798 --> 01:26:13.567
I just wanted this.
