OK, OK.

20:57.604 --> 20:59.388
IT'S JUST A BALLOON.

21:01.956 --> 21:04.524
ALL RIGHT, FOLKS,
AS YOU WERE.

21:04.698 --> 21:07.266
OK, I'LL GO.
YOU STAY WITH WYATT

21:07.440 --> 21:10.138
AND MAKE SURE
HE TURNS PINOCCHIO
BACK INTO WOOD.

21:15.099 --> 21:16.623
DON'T YOU WORRY,
LITTLE BUDDY.

21:16.797 --> 21:19.190
WE AIN'T GONNA GIVE UP
UNTIL WE FIND HIM.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.975
YOU CAN COUNT ON IT.

21:29.897 --> 21:32.508
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GO TALK TO HIM.

21:32.682 --> 21:33.683
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY?

21:33.857 --> 21:35.642
WELL, YOU KNOW HIM BEST.

21:35.816 --> 21:37.818
YEAH, IT WORKED
SO WELL BEFORE.

21:37.992 --> 21:39.341
COME ON, HENRY.

21:47.088 --> 21:49.046

21:49.220 --> 21:51.092
DON'T EVEN START, MAN,
OK? IT'S NO USE.

21:51.266 --> 21:53.181
GOOD. GOOD. THAT'S WHAT
YOU'LL TELL YOUR SON,
RIGHT?

21:53.355 --> 21:55.444
YOU LEAVE HIM
OUT OF THIS.

21:55.618 --> 21:58.360
HE'S ALREADY IN IT.
THE THINGS YOU DO AFFECT
YOUR SON, NICK...

21:58.534 --> 22:00.188
BIG TIME.

22:00.362 --> 22:02.059
IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT
FOR HIM?

22:02.233 --> 22:03.234
WHAT I WANT?

22:03.409 --> 22:04.845
YEAH, FOR HIM.
FOR YOUR SON.

22:05.019 --> 22:06.673
WHAT I WANT IS NOT
TO HAVE BEEN TREATED

22:06.847 --> 22:09.110
LIKE A FRICKIN' PARIAH
EVER SINCE I GOT BACK.

22:09.284 --> 22:11.112
YOU GOTTA EXPECT THAT
WHEN YOU DO TIME.

22:11.286 --> 22:12.853
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
WHEN I GOT OUT OF
PRISON.

22:13.027 --> 22:14.768
I'M TALKING ABOUT
WHEN I GOT OUT OF IRAQ.

22:14.942 --> 22:17.553
I RISKED MY LIFE
OVER THERE,
AND FOR WHAT--HUH?

22:17.727 --> 22:20.817
TO BE TREATED LIKE CRAP
EVER SINCE I GOT BACK?

22:20.991 --> 22:23.559
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

22:23.733 --> 22:25.909
IT'S NOT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S NOT RIGHT, NICK.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.782
BUT NEITHER IS THIS--
GETTING EVEN,
IT'S NOT THE ANSWER.

22:28.956 --> 22:31.045

DO THINGS YOU'RE
GONNA REGRET.

22:31.219 --> 22:32.873
YOU'RE HURT.
I MEAN, YOU'RE ANGRY.

22:33.047 --> 22:35.354
I DON'T BLAME YOU.
I WOULD BE, TOO.

22:35.528 --> 22:38.139
NOBODY HERE BLAMES YOU.
THEY'LL TAKE THAT
INTO ACCOUNT.

22:38.313 --> 22:40.533
BUT YOU GOTTA STOP...
RIGHT NOW.

22:40.707 --> 22:42.143
FOR YOUR SON.

22:42.317 --> 22:45.581
PUT THAT GUN DOWN.
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

22:45.755 --> 22:48.323

YOU'RE GONNA BE OK.

24:04.791 --> 24:06.140
WELL?

24:06.314 --> 24:08.577
THE WITCH HAS PROBLEMS
OF HER OWN AT THE MOMENT.

24:08.751 --> 24:10.449
EXPLAIN!

24:10.623 --> 24:13.452
SHE'S BEING HELD HOSTAGE,
ALONG WITH ONE OF
THE CHARMED ONES

24:13.626 --> 24:14.801
IN A BANK.

24:14.975 --> 24:17.630
SHOTS WERE FIRED.
A MORTAL WAS WOUNDED.

24:17.804 --> 24:19.632
WHY DON'T THEY USE
THEIR POWERS?

24:19.806 --> 24:21.068
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T.

24:21.242 --> 24:23.157
AND NEITHER CAN WE.

24:23.331 --> 24:25.899
IT'S ONE OF THE FEW THINGS
BOTH SIDES AGREED UPON
EONS AGO.

24:26.073 --> 24:29.250
NEITHER CAN LEAVE
A MAGICAL TRAIL
FOR MORTALS TO FOLLOW.

24:29.424 --> 24:31.644
THE SECRET MUST BE KEPT.

24:31.818 --> 24:33.036
SO WE JUST WAIT?

24:33.210 --> 24:36.387
NO. WE TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THEIR SITUATION.

24:36.562 --> 24:38.520
IF I TIME IT JUST RIGHT,

24:38.694 --> 24:41.175
I JUST MIGHT
BE ABLE TO FORCE
THEIR MAGICAL HAND,

24:41.349 --> 24:44.004
MAKE THEM CHOOSE
BETWEEN EXPOSING
THEIR SECRET

24:44.178 --> 24:45.658
AND SAVING INNOCENTS,

24:45.832 --> 24:47.442
SOMETHING THEY'RE
HONOR-BOUND TO DO.

24:47.616 --> 24:49.618

EXPOSING OUR--WE WON'T BE!

FACES...

IS ABOUT TO LEARN.

25:52.986 --> 25:54.727

FOR YOU?

25:54.901 --> 25:56.946

HANG ON, OK?

YOU CAN DO THAT.

26:03.257 --> 26:04.824

TALK TO HIM, OK?

26:04.998 --> 26:07.827
HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S DOING.

26:08.001 --> 26:09.176
YOU CAN HELP HIM.

26:12.962 --> 26:14.355
HOW IS HE?

26:16.662 --> 26:20.404
HE NEEDS
TO SEE A DOCTOR.
THAT'S HOW HE IS.

26:20.579 --> 26:21.405
OK.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.625
OK, WELL, UH...

26:23.799 --> 26:25.845
SOON AS THE HELICOPTER
GETS HERE.

26:26.019 --> 26:27.760
HE MIGHT NOT
MAKE IT THAT LONG.

26:27.934 --> 26:29.979

SHOOT HIM.

HAVE BEEN SHOT!

KNOW THAT, WHICH IS WHY
I KNOW DEEP DOWN
