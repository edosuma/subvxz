IT'S RIBBONS OF GOO.

HASN'T BEEN A COMPLETE FAILURE.

33:07.619 --> 33:10.420

33:16.095 --> 33:18.428

33:25.837 --> 33:28.638

LET'S TEST IT.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.040
THERE IT GOES.

33:30.042 --> 33:33.309

OH, GOD.

34:15.954 --> 34:18.955

BUT IT'LL STILL HELP US TO SEE

34:36.108 --> 34:39.641

-YEAH.
-...DUNKED INTO GASOLINE.

37:09.661 --> 37:11.594
Brian: I DON'T THINK YOU CAN GO
WRONG WITH THAT.

37:11.596 --> 37:13.663
THE ARROW IS
AN INCENDIARY COCKTAIL,

37:13.665 --> 37:17.934
WHICH SHOULD PACK A FIERY PUNCH
IF IT HITS THE RIGHT SPOT.

37:17.936 --> 37:19.535
JUST ONE MORE
FOR INSURANCE.

37:19.537 --> 37:22.739
SO WITH THE FINAL
TEST SETUP COMPLETE,

37:22.741 --> 37:27.410
WILL A WELL-PLACED FIRE ARROW

37:27.412 --> 37:29.746
I'M GETTING THE HECK
OUT OF HERE.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.547
COME TO SAFETY!

37:31.549 --> 37:35.551
FLAMING ARROW INTO GAS TANK

37:40.958 --> 37:42.625
OH, YEAH.
IT'S ON FIRE.

37:42.627 --> 37:45.094
OH!
DIRECT HIT.

37:45.096 --> 37:47.496
SMOLDERING, BUT IT DIDN'T
GO UP IN FLAME.

37:47.498 --> 37:49.099
THAT'S IN THE GAS TANK?

37:49.101 --> 37:51.034
I DON'T KNOW.
ALL RIGHT.

37:51.036 --> 37:52.168
YOU'RE WANT TO
POP THAT THING,

37:52.170 --> 37:53.303
AND IN CASE YOU
BURST INTO FLAMES,

37:53.305 --> 37:54.370
I'LL PUT YOU OUT.

37:54.372 --> 37:58.041
-ALL RIGHT. YOU READY?
-HERE WE GO.

37:58.043 --> 37:59.375
HOW DOES IT LOOK?

37:59.377 --> 38:01.044
OH, NO.
I THINK WE'RE SAFE.

38:01.046 --> 38:05.515
THAT'S A LITTLE WAYS
AWAY THERE.

38:05.517 --> 38:09.486
THE ARROW FAILED TO
PENETRATE THE GAS TANK.

38:11.522 --> 38:14.524
OUR FIRST ARROW WAS DELIVERED
PERFECTLY ON TARGET

38:14.526 --> 38:16.325
WITH ALL OUR FLAMMABLE
MATERIAL LIT,

38:16.327 --> 38:19.795
BUT IT STOPPED ABOUT
EIGHT INCHES FROM THE GAS TANK.

38:19.797 --> 38:22.265
WE THINK OUR FLAMMABLE
MATERIAL JAMMED UP

38:22.267 --> 38:24.267
AND KEPT THE ARROW
FROM PENETRATING THROUGH.

38:24.269 --> 38:26.136
SO THIS IS OUR SIMPLE FIX.

38:26.138 --> 38:28.471
LOOSER ZIP TIES MEANS
EASIER SLIDING,

38:28.473 --> 38:30.740
SO WHEN IT HITS
THE GAS TANK, WHOOP,

38:30.742 --> 38:33.609
IT WON'T STOP THE ARROW
RIGHT AT THE TIP.

38:33.611 --> 38:36.479
THREE, TWO, ONE.

38:39.550 --> 38:41.551
WELL, SOMETHING
WENT WRONG THERE.

38:41.553 --> 38:44.620
Narrator:
THIS TIME, THE FLAMMABLE
MATERIAL WAS TOO LOOSE,

38:44.622 --> 38:47.223
FLYING OFF THE ARROW
PRIOR TO IMPACT,

38:47.225 --> 38:49.626
BUT THERE IS SOME GOOD NEWS.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.494
Brian:
THE GAS IS LEAKING, THOUGH.

38:51.496 --> 38:54.831
THE ARROW IS ALL THE WAY UP TO
THE FLETCHING IN THE GAS TANK.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.633
LET'S PATCH THIS
AND GIVE IT ANOTHER CHANCE.

38:56.635 --> 38:58.568
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE
TWO MODIFICATIONS.

38:58.570 --> 39:01.571
THE FIRST ONE IS GETTING THAT
WRAP TO SIT JUST LOOSE ENOUGH

39:01.573 --> 39:03.640
SO THAT IT'LL FLY BACK
BUT JUST TIGHT ENOUGH

39:03.642 --> 39:05.241
SO IT WON'T FLY OFF THE END.

39:05.243 --> 39:08.378
THE SECOND ONE IS THIS.

39:08.380 --> 39:10.847
WE'VE EMBEDDED SOME CANNON FUSE
SO EVEN IF OUR FIRST PLAN

39:10.849 --> 39:12.248
DOESN'T WORK,

39:12.250 --> 39:14.584
HOPEFULLY, WE'LL GET IGNITION
INSIDE THE GAS TANK.

39:14.586 --> 39:16.786
MM, DRINK UP, THIRSTY ARROW.

39:16.788 --> 39:20.757
OKAY.
IN THREE, TWO, ONE.

39:23.060 --> 39:24.193
APPROACH WITH SAFETY?

39:24.195 --> 39:25.462
YEAH.

39:25.464 --> 39:27.530
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

39:27.532 --> 39:31.067
OH, HIT THE BUMPER,
UP INTO THE FRAME.

39:31.069 --> 39:33.803
Narrator: THIS TIME,
MOTHER NATURE IS TO BLAME,

39:33.805 --> 39:36.606
A FREAK GUST OF WIND
KNOCKING THE ARROW OFF TARGET.

39:36.608 --> 39:37.674
YOU READY TO TRY AGAIN?

39:37.676 --> 39:41.411
YEAH.
LET'S DO IT.

39:41.413 --> 39:45.347
BUT EVERY ARROW THE GUYS FIRE
EITHER MISFIRES,

39:45.349 --> 39:49.085
BREAKS ON IMPACT OR FAILS
TO PUNCTURE THE GAS TANK.

39:49.087 --> 39:51.821
IT IS REALLY HARD TO SHOOT
A FLAMING CROSSBOW BOLT.

39:51.823 --> 39:56.159
AT THIS POINT,
WE FIRED QUITE A FEW ARROWS.

39:56.161 --> 39:58.628
WE'VE ALREADY HAD AN ARROW
THAT PIERCED THE GAS TANK

39:58.630 --> 40:00.029
AND CAUSED GAS TO LEAK OUT.

40:00.031 --> 40:02.765
WE'VE HAD ARROWS HIT
THE QUARTER PANEL AND STAY LIT.

40:02.767 --> 40:04.433
OH, YEAH.
IT'S ON FIRE.

40:04.435 --> 40:05.835
OH!

40:05.837 --> 40:07.369
BUT WE'RE NOT GETTING
THESE BEST-CASE SCENARIOS

40:07.371 --> 40:09.038
AT THE SAME TIME.

40:09.040 --> 40:10.506
I THINK WE COMBINE
OUR BEST-CASE SCENARIOS

40:10.508 --> 40:13.375
TO GIVE US THE ULTIMATE
BEST CASE SCENARIO.

40:13.377 --> 40:14.644
WHAT'S THAT?

40:14.646 --> 40:16.045
WE UNPLUG THE HOLE
IN THE GAS TANK

40:16.047 --> 40:19.048
CAUSED BY THE PREVIOUS ARROW,
SO IT'S LEAKING GAS.

40:19.050 --> 40:21.116
WE PLUG IN
A FRESH FIRE ARROW,

40:21.118 --> 40:23.386
AND IF THAT DOESN'T ENGULF
THIS CAR IN FLAMES,

40:23.388 --> 40:25.988
I DON'T THINK
ANYTHING WILL.

40:25.990 --> 40:28.524
Narrator: SO BRIAN AND JON
ARE STRETCHING THE BOUNDS

40:28.526 --> 40:30.860
OF PROBABILITY
ON THIS MYTH.

40:30.862 --> 40:33.530
WHILE TESTING HAS SHOWN
IT'S UNLIKELY A FIRE ARROW

40:33.532 --> 40:36.799
WOULD BOTH PUNCTURE
THE GAS TANK AND STAY LIT,

40:36.801 --> 40:40.336
THERE'S A SLIM
POSSIBILITY IT COULD.

40:40.338 --> 40:43.405
THEY'LL SIMULATE THIS
IMPROBABLE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS

40:43.407 --> 40:46.475
BY RIGGING A FIRE ARROW
IN A HOLE IN THE GAS TANK

40:46.477 --> 40:49.078
AND IGNITING IT REMOTELY.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.413
SORRY, BUT I THINK
YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED.

40:51.415 --> 40:52.749
BOOP!
OKAY.

40:52.751 --> 40:53.950
HERE WE GO.

40:53.952 --> 40:57.287
MAN-MADE IDEAL SITUATION
WITH LEAKING GAS TANK

40:57.289 --> 41:04.227
AND FIRE ARROW ALREADY IN
GAS TANK IN THREE, TWO, ONE.

41:04.229 --> 41:05.829
-THERE IT GOES!
-IT'S IGNITED.

41:05.831 --> 41:07.363
Jon: THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

41:07.365 --> 41:09.032
IT'S STILL A LITTLE BIT,
I'D SAY A LITTLE BIT SMALLER

41:09.034 --> 41:11.033
THAN THE ONES YOU SEE
IN MOVIES AND TV.

41:11.035 --> 41:12.635
NO BONFIRE.

41:12.637 --> 41:14.971
AND EVEN A MINUTE
AFTER IGNITION,

41:14.973 --> 41:17.973
THERE'S STILL
NO FLAMING INFERNO.

41:17.975 --> 41:20.977
THIS MYTH CALLED FOR THIS GIANT
FIREBALL ENGULFING THE CAR.

41:20.979 --> 41:25.114
THE FIRE IS PRETTY WEAK, KIND
OF LIKE THE MYTH, UNDERWHELMING.

41:25.116 --> 41:27.049
IT'S BEEN
A COUPLE MINUTES.

41:27.051 --> 41:29.585
I THINK
THE CAR IS ON FIRE.

41:29.587 --> 41:31.855
THE LAST TIME I WATCHED A MOVIE,
WHEN THE CAR EXPLODED,

41:31.857 --> 41:37.860
IT WASN'T, LIKE,
A 8-MINUTE-LONG SCENE.

41:37.862 --> 41:40.663
IN FACT, IT TAKES A FULL
30 MINUTES FOR THE BLAZE

41:40.665 --> 41:43.132
TO COMPLETELY SWALLOW THE CAR.

41:43.134 --> 41:46.001
THE CAR IS OBVIOUSLY ON FIRE.
EVERYTHING IS ON FIRE.

41:46.003 --> 41:50.139
IT'S ARMAGEDDON,
AND I LOVE IT.

41:50.141 --> 41:54.343
SO BUSTER'S RECKLESSLY PARKED
RIDE DOES END UP DEEP-FRIED,

41:54.345 --> 41:57.814
BUT THE MYTH HAS
GONE UP IN SMOKE, TOO.

41:57.816 --> 42:00.483
WELL, IN TERMS OF A SINGLE
FIRE ARROW CAUSING A CAR

42:00.485 --> 42:02.885
TO ERUPT IN FLAMES,
OBVIOUSLY BUSTED.

42:02.887 --> 42:05.955
I AGREE.
BUSTED.

42:05.957 --> 42:07.890
YOU THINK
WE SHOULD PUT IT OUT?

42:07.892 --> 42:09.091
YEAH, PROBABLY.

42:09.093 --> 42:10.960
I GOT THIS.
I'LL SEE YOU DOWN THERE!

42:10.962 --> 42:13.362
I THINK WE NEED
THE WATER TRUCK, JON!

42:13.364 --> 42:15.532
I'LL BE FINE!

42:18.236 --> 42:20.103
MAYBE GET THE WATER TRUCK!

42:20.105 --> 42:22.104
-WATER TRUCK.
-MAYBE GET THE WATER TRUCK NOW!

42:22.106 --> 42:24.039
