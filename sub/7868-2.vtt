a morning bath *

01:08.317 --> 01:10.484
* She wets her hair *

01:10.551 --> 01:13.751

01:21.150 --> 01:23.918
This will be a good day.
This will be a good day.

01:23.983 --> 01:25.950
This will be a good day.

01:28.584 --> 01:30.950

01:31.017 --> 01:33.851
Your man is going to love

Check it out.

02:02.117 --> 02:03.651
Okay, Edna, remember:

02:03.717 --> 02:06.083
if you can teach one kid
one thing,

02:06.150 --> 02:08.116
then today will be a success.

02:08.184 --> 02:11.350
(electronic beeps and blips)

02:11.417 --> 02:13.484
Now, class....

02:13.551 --> 02:15.117
class.

02:15.184 --> 02:17.517
Class, please pay attention!

02:17.584 --> 02:19.751

You're children.

02:41.751 --> 02:43.818
Why do you all need cell phones?

02:43.884 --> 02:45.384
Safety.
Emergencies.

02:45.451 --> 02:47.117
Safety.
Educational.

02:47.184 --> 02:50.684
(sighs) Could you at least
set them to vibrate?

02:50.751 --> 02:54.284
(loud vibrating)

02:54.350 --> 02:56.017

02:56.083 --> 02:58.083
That's it:
everything in the box.

03:01.217 --> 03:03.417
No more gizmos in this class.

03:03.484 --> 03:06.517
They're all going in the drawer
with the biology frogs.

03:06.584 --> 03:08.117

03:11.950 --> 03:13.350
(students groaning)

03:13.417 --> 03:15.117
Okay. We'll call your bluff.

03:15.184 --> 03:17.950
Teach us-- using only
the knowledge in your own head.

03:18.017 --> 03:19.818
Hey, don't worry.

03:19.884 --> 03:22.384
We still have the good old
classroom computer.

My stroked-out grandfather
has more memory than that thing.

03:34.150 --> 03:35.484
How is he doing?

03:35.551 --> 03:37.184
Better. Thanks.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.651
(muttering angrily)

03:39.717 --> 03:42.317
How could Krabappel
take my cell phone?

03:42.384 --> 03:45.818
I'm only on month one
of a 60-month plan.

03:45.884 --> 03:47.884
You know, Krabappel
just needs to chill out

03:47.950 --> 03:50.117
and realize life is cool--
but how?

03:50.184 --> 03:52.017
(Homer giggling)

03:56.083 --> 03:59.083
(drunkenly):
Okay. Now I'll be the dog,

03:59.150 --> 04:01.217
and you be the daddy.

04:01.284 --> 04:02.484
(barks)

04:02.551 --> 04:05.651
(Santa's Little Helper barking)

04:07.751 --> 04:09.551
Hmm. You know,

04:09.617 --> 04:12.350
my dad is a lot more fun
after a few beers.

04:12.417 --> 04:16.050
Maybe Mrs. K would be nicer
if we "Irish up" her coffee.

04:16.117 --> 04:17.451
Put blood in it?

04:17.517 --> 04:18.884
No, booze.

04:18.950 --> 04:20.117
First the easy part.

04:20.184 --> 04:22.083
Kids, get some liquor.

04:22.150 --> 04:25.684
(Tchaikovsky's "Dance of the
Sugar Plum Fairy" plays)

04:52.417 --> 04:53.717
Hurry! She's almost
done flirting

04:53.784 --> 04:55.617
with the vending
machine guy.

04:55.684 --> 04:57.784
(laughing)

05:11.717 --> 05:13.684
What if she
tastes the booze?

05:13.751 --> 05:15.217
Relax.

05:15.284 --> 05:16.950
Hazelnut creamer
covers all sins.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.317
(slurping)

05:18.384 --> 05:20.684
Ah.

05:20.751 --> 05:22.918
<i>And that's why I found
Good Night, Gorilla</i>

05:22.983 --> 05:25.050
to be the perfect
summer beach read.

05:25.117 --> 05:27.651
Two stars for you.

05:27.717 --> 05:29.317
And an extra,

05:29.384 --> 05:33.083
'cause you're going
to have a hard life.

05:33.150 --> 05:35.517
* This old man, he played one *

05:35.584 --> 05:38.818
* He played knickknack
on my (hiccups) thumb. *

05:47.217 --> 05:49.017
You look tired.

05:49.083 --> 05:51.950
Maybe you need some more coffee.

05:53.851 --> 05:55.451
Ah.

05:57.117 --> 06:01.117
(giggling drunkenly)

06:01.184 --> 06:02.384
Dizzy.

06:02.451 --> 06:04.717
(students giggling)

06:08.350 --> 06:10.950
* You'll be going
back to Denmark *

06:11.017 --> 06:13.250
* Spain and Uruguay *

06:13.317 --> 06:16.250
* And we promise
that we'll write you *

06:16.317 --> 06:18.517
* But you know
that that's a lie *

06:18.584 --> 06:21.918
Hey! You know why
they call it a choir.

06:21.983 --> 06:25.884
Because "choir" we
listening to this crap?

06:25.950 --> 06:28.350
(grunts) These pantyhose
are all twisted up.

06:28.417 --> 06:31.083
Edna, please! Even the union
can't protect you from this.

06:36.050 --> 06:37.818
Give me one
night, Dewey.

06:37.884 --> 06:39.818
I'll get you
off Broadway.

06:39.884 --> 06:41.684
Never!
Edna, let's go.

06:43.350 --> 06:44.717
Uh-oh.

06:44.784 --> 06:46.983
Do you think
we went too far?
Nah.

06:47.050 --> 06:50.350
Booze only makes you do things
you already wanted to do.

06:50.417 --> 06:53.017
I'm queen of the world!

06:53.083 --> 06:54.250
Oh!
(crashing)

06:54.317 --> 06:55.417
(Krabappel groans)

07:02.751 --> 07:03.617
I'm so sorry.

07:03.684 --> 07:05.284
I really don't know
what happened.

07:05.350 --> 07:07.884
You made quite a nanny goat
of yourself yesterday.

07:07.950 --> 07:10.684
I know I did,
but I don't know why.

07:10.751 --> 07:12.884
(sighs) This is the hardest
thing I've ever had to do,

07:12.950 --> 07:14.184
but I'm letting you go.

07:15.517 --> 07:16.918
Seymour...

07:16.983 --> 07:18.684
I'm going to cry.

07:19.818 --> 07:22.784
Here. Take my hanky.

07:22.851 --> 07:26.350
I'm working on my magic act
for the Faculty Follies.

07:26.417 --> 07:30.083
But right now,
I don't feel much like follying.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.451
Could I have a moment alone?

07:32.517 --> 07:33.717
Of course.

07:37.651 --> 07:40.184
There's a form to extend your
health insurance on my desk.

07:44.451 --> 07:46.851
I never wanted
her to get fired.

07:46.918 --> 07:49.684
I bet it was that hamster
medicine we added

07:49.751 --> 07:51.217
that put her
over the edge.

07:51.284 --> 07:54.083
Maybe I should tell Skinner
that it was our...

07:54.150 --> 07:55.983
Needle scratch!

07:56.050 --> 07:57.918
My name is Zachary Vaughn.

07:57.983 --> 08:00.584
I just got my masters
in education

08:00.651 --> 08:03.584
from Tufts University,
and you are my first class ever.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.517
An M.E.D. from Tufts?

08:05.584 --> 08:06.851
Nice.

08:06.918 --> 08:09.684
But why talk when I could text?

08:11.517 --> 08:13.117
Our cell phones!
Our Blueteeth!

08:13.184 --> 08:14.751
My tip calculator!

08:17.551 --> 08:19.417
(electronic tones sounding)

08:20.918 --> 08:22.484
STUDENTS:
Whoa!

08:22.551 --> 08:24.684
That text was totally worth

08:24.751 --> 08:27.884
the 15 cents it cost
to receive it.

08:27.950 --> 08:29.050
<i>BART:
Then, Zach Skyped us,</i>

08:29.117 --> 08:30.451
live-blogged our
spelling bee

08:30.517 --> 08:32.217
and friended us
on Facebook.

08:32.284 --> 08:35.183
I thought you were studying
the Lincoln-Douglas debates.

08:35.250 --> 08:37.217
You mean the L Man/D Dog
flame wars.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.116
(groans)

08:39.183 --> 08:41.217
I'm glad you've got
such a stimulating substitute,

08:41.284 --> 08:43.284
but I'm worried
about Mrs. Krabappel.

08:43.350 --> 08:45.050
Oh, no worries.

08:45.117 --> 08:47.484
I heard on the four-square
court she's doing great.

08:47.551 --> 08:49.617
No one even plays
four-square anymore.

08:49.684 --> 08:50.950
They just gossip.

08:53.684 --> 08:55.417
Ah...

08:57.184 --> 08:58.617
All right.

08:58.684 --> 09:01.317
Who can tell me
what the Monroe Doctrine was?

09:01.384 --> 09:03.050
Oh, oh!

09:03.117 --> 09:04.851
The policy of President Monroe
that America

09:04.918 --> 09:07.184
has the right as a nation to...
Wait, wait, wait.

09:07.250 --> 09:09.317
Are you telling me
you memorized that fact

09:09.384 --> 09:12.417
when anyone with a cell phone
can find it out in 30 seconds?

09:12.484 --> 09:14.050
I-I...

09:14.117 --> 09:17.150
I've crammed my head
full of garbage!

09:17.217 --> 09:18.918
Yes, you have.

09:20.017 --> 09:21.150
What are these?

09:21.217 --> 09:22.784
Those are smiley stickers.

09:22.851 --> 09:25.150
Mrs. Krabappel used to put them
on our papers

09:25.217 --> 09:26.751
as a reward for good work.

09:26.818 --> 09:28.317
I run a paperless classroom.

09:28.384 --> 09:29.784
Check this out.

09:29.851 --> 09:34.284
But this is just
nonsense punctuation.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.884
Oh, my God!

09:37.950 --> 09:40.484
Anybody want to return
these caveman kudos

09:40.551 --> 09:42.150
to Mrs. Krabappel?

09:42.217 --> 09:44.350
Uh, sure.
It's sort of on my way home.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.284
I can check up on the old girl.

09:46.350 --> 09:49.851
She probably landed a job at
some fancy-schmancy prep school.

09:52.350 --> 09:54.250
Make way for the new freshman.

09:54.317 --> 09:57.217
Where do I find the books,
the booze and the broads?

09:58.818 --> 10:00.818
Hey, Dean, how about
a little privacy?

10:00.884 --> 10:02.684
I've got to matriculate.

10:02.751 --> 10:03.983
(laughs halfheartedly)

10:04.050 --> 10:05.417
(doorbell rings)
Door's broken.

10:05.484 --> 10:08.150
Mrs. K, is everything
all right?

10:08.217 --> 10:09.684
Sure. (coughs)

10:09.751 --> 10:11.417
Never better.

10:11.484 --> 10:13.751
(hacking)

10:13.818 --> 10:15.384
I know, Bart.

10:15.451 --> 10:18.851
It's pretty sad to see
your teacher fallen so low.

10:18.918 --> 10:20.751
(laughing)

10:20.818 --> 10:23.484
It's the movie.
It's so funny.

10:26.217 --> 10:29.050
Sir, this is a benefit to
increase our endowment.

10:29.117 --> 10:31.184
Honey, if we increase
your endowment any more,

10:31.250 --> 10:32.684
we'll all be in the shade.

10:32.751 --> 10:34.184
Hey, you're all right.

10:35.551 --> 10:37.517
Hey, everyone,
dessert's on me.

10:37.584 --> 10:38.851
(chuckles)

10:38.918 --> 10:40.451
(laughing)

10:41.452 --> 10:42.452
Sorry, sorry.

10:50.067 --> 10:52.401
Thanks for bringing over
the smiley stickers, Bart.

10:52.401 --> 10:53.801
They really liven
the place the up

10:53.868 --> 10:56.167
Mrs. K, you've got
to get out of here.

10:56.234 --> 10:57.933
When was the last time
you washed your hair?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.768
Hmm. Two weeks ago?

10:59.834 --> 11:01.300
Well, that's better than me,

11:01.367 --> 11:03.100
but still,
you've got to get out.

11:03.167 --> 11:04.501
What's the point?

11:04.567 --> 11:06.267
Out of work, I'm out of money.

11:06.334 --> 11:07.900
No man wants me,
except Disco Stu.

11:07.967 --> 11:10.933
Stu is about more
than just disco.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.601
I'm also-- ha! --

11:12.667 --> 11:14.634
super Christian!

11:16.768 --> 11:18.701
Okay, look, there's a big
football game on tonight,

11:18.768 --> 11:20.567
so we can get this thing
over real quick.

11:20.634 --> 11:23.167
Show me some of Bart's artwork,
give me a little false hope,

11:23.234 --> 11:26.167
and here's a little something
to help with his grades.

11:26.234 --> 11:28.868
I'm not asking for A's,
just incompletes.

11:28.967 --> 11:30.933
Mr. Simpson, I don't
need your money.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.834
Bart can definitely be
a challenge,

11:32.900 --> 11:34.734
but, yeah, I like challenges,
and he...

11:34.801 --> 11:36.401
(laughing):
...he's got a wild sense
of humor.

11:36.467 --> 11:37.834
Look at this picture he drew.

11:37.900 --> 11:39.167
(laughs)

11:39.234 --> 11:40.701
It will be his last birthday

11:40.768 --> 11:42.401
if he keeps drawing pictures
like this.

11:42.467 --> 11:44.334
What?
I said,
are there any areas

11:44.401 --> 11:46.734
that we, his parents,
can improve upon?

11:46.801 --> 11:49.667
Yes. Just one: relax.

11:49.734 --> 11:51.467
You're clearly
a caring father.

11:53.567 --> 11:55.100
(crying)

11:55.167 --> 11:57.667
You're the first teacher
that ever got me.

11:57.734 --> 11:59.200
(crying)

11:59.267 --> 12:01.667
Let it out. Let it out.

12:01.734 --> 12:04.701
(sobbing)

12:04.768 --> 12:07.134
(loud sobbing)

12:09.401 --> 12:11.701
(very loud sobbing)

12:13.134 --> 12:15.467
Keep it in. Keep it in.

12:15.534 --> 12:18.300
(very loud sobbing)

12:20.467 --> 12:23.367
Two hot chocolates
with hot fudge boost.

12:23.434 --> 12:24.734
Milhouse... (sighs)

12:24.801 --> 12:26.367
...we ruined Edna's life.

12:26.434 --> 12:28.067
Maybe we can get her job back.

12:28.134 --> 12:29.667
But we can't lose Zack.

12:29.734 --> 12:32.601
Look at the awesome video
he just e-mailed me.

12:32.667 --> 12:36.501
Check out the multiples
of seven, y'all.

12:36.567 --> 12:38.900
* *

12:42.834 --> 12:45.634
There's got to be
some other way to help Mrs. K.

12:45.701 --> 12:47.768
Maybe we can find an
answer in this bookstore.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.267
Bookstores don't have answers.

12:49.334 --> 12:51.434
They just have creepy guys
sitting in easy chairs

12:51.501 --> 12:53.200
at the end of aisle ways.

12:53.267 --> 12:55.768
I ain't paid for Doris
Kearns Goodwin in my life,

12:55.834 --> 12:57.801
and I ain't gonna start now.

12:57.868 --> 12:59.967
Oh, that's some good
Doris there.

13:00.033 --> 13:01.501
You're right.

13:01.567 --> 13:03.501
I guess no one's
ever written a book

13:03.567 --> 13:05.801
to help a middle-aged
woman turn her life around.

13:05.868 --> 13:10.134
<i>Excuse me. I believe you boys
are looking for... The Answer.</i>

13:10.200 --> 13:11.801
<i>What's The Answer?</i>

13:11.868 --> 13:16.868
Only the best-selling book,
slash, DVD since the bible.

13:16.933 --> 13:18.933
<i>WOMAN (with Australian accent):
My life was over.</i>

13:19.000 --> 13:21.900
<i>I'd lost my job,
my husband left me.</i>

13:21.967 --> 13:24.567
<i>I had to sleep
in a kangaroo's pouch.</i>

13:24.634 --> 13:27.534
<i>And then I found...
The Answer.</i>

13:27.601 --> 13:29.933
("O Fortuna" from Carmina Burana
plays)

13:30.000 --> 13:32.634
<i>The Answer was discovered</i>

13:32.701 --> 13:35.067
<i>by the philosophers
of ancient Greece, who hid it</i>

13:35.134 --> 13:37.601
<i>under a rock where it was
discovered by the knights</i>

13:37.667 --> 13:39.434
<i>of King Arthur,
who placed it in a bottle</i>

13:39.501 --> 13:41.534
<i>and set it in the ocean,</i>

13:41.601 --> 13:43.967
<i>where it was found
by Pat Sajak.</i>

13:46.701 --> 13:49.234
<i>These great men
knew The Answer.</i>

13:55.334 --> 13:59.167
<i>The Answer is the secret to
achieving your heart's desire.</i>

13:59.234 --> 14:01.933
<i>Learn The Answer,

14:02.000 --> 14:03.567
<i>ANNOUNCER:

14:03.634 --> 14:05.834
<i>quasi-scientific
self-help books are sold.</i>

14:09.634 --> 14:11.100
So, um, you're wearing
the same bathrobe

14:11.167 --> 14:13.000
you were the last
time I was here, huh?

14:13.067 --> 14:14.467
That's cool.

14:14.534 --> 14:16.100
Bart, you're a good kid.

14:16.167 --> 14:17.667
You're the only one
who came to see me.

14:17.734 --> 14:19.467
Well, Mrs. K,

14:19.534 --> 14:22.067
<i>I have just the book, slash, DVD
for you-- The Answer.</i>

14:22.134 --> 14:24.534
"This book uses
the ancient power of wanting."

14:24.601 --> 14:26.401
That makes absolutely no sense.

14:26.467 --> 14:28.967
Hey. "Just because
we don't understand electricity,

14:29.033 --> 14:31.334
doesn't mean we can't enjoy
its benefits."

14:31.401 --> 14:33.167
But we do
understand electricity.

14:33.234 --> 14:35.701
Every positively charged
nucleus is...

14:35.768 --> 14:37.667
Cut it out.
You're not a teacher anymore.

14:37.734 --> 14:39.234
Way to cheer me up, kid.

14:39.300 --> 14:40.634
(coughing)

14:40.701 --> 14:42.768
Look, Mrs. K, I'm a Simpson,

14:42.834 --> 14:44.334
and a Simpson
never gives up

14:44.401 --> 14:46.367
until he's tried at
least one easy thing.

14:46.434 --> 14:47.868
Let me help you.

14:47.933 --> 14:49.501
Aw.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.801
So, did you write
your dream on the...

14:52.868 --> 14:55.401
"index card of fate"?

14:55.467 --> 14:57.768
Yes, but it still seems...

14:57.834 --> 15:01.100
<i>stupid.</i>

15:01.167 --> 15:03.734
reading:

15:03.801 --> 15:05.267
Great idea!

15:05.334 --> 15:06.868
Now, let's see.

15:06.933 --> 15:09.200
"Break your dream down
into smaller wishes,

15:09.267 --> 15:12.000
then break those down
into wish-able actions."

15:12.067 --> 15:13.967
Bart, this is starting to sound

15:14.033 --> 15:16.134
like one of those loony
self-help books.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.100
Loony? Would a loony self-help
book come with a magic

15:19.167 --> 15:20.900
question mark inside?

15:20.967 --> 15:22.367
Huh? Huh? Huh?

15:24.900 --> 15:27.768
<i>All thanks to The Answer!</i>

15:27.834 --> 15:29.567
Well, opening this store
was a lot of work,

15:29.634 --> 15:31.267
but your faith in me
got me through it.

15:31.334 --> 15:33.033
And it looks like

15:33.100 --> 15:34.534
you got your own
index card of fate.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.200
What's your dream?
Nothing, nothing.

15:37.267 --> 15:39.534
Well, I'm sure
it'll come true.

15:45.401 --> 15:47.768
(humming)

15:47.834 --> 15:49.768
One cran-bran
for the Flan-man.

15:49.834 --> 15:51.501
My pleasure.

15:51.567 --> 15:52.900
What did he want?

15:52.967 --> 15:54.401
Beats me.

15:54.467 --> 15:56.100
I just gave him a banana.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.900
Well, thanks again, Bart.

15:57.967 --> 16:00.601
This store has definitely
turned my life around.

16:00.667 --> 16:02.768
Yup. I'm off the hook now.

16:02.834 --> 16:04.234
What do you mean by that?

16:04.300 --> 16:06.134
Well, I guess I can tell you,

16:06.200 --> 16:08.933
'cause everything worked out
for the best.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.601
Everything? What everything?

16:11.667 --> 16:13.000
(laughs)

16:13.067 --> 16:14.634
Well, it's funny, really.

16:14.701 --> 16:16.701
I'm the one
who put booze in your coffee

16:16.768 --> 16:18.567
and got you fired.

16:18.634 --> 16:19.900
(laughs)

16:19.967 --> 16:21.567
You did what?!

16:21.634 --> 16:23.868
Please don't kill me.

16:26.034 --> 16:28.034
You ruined my life!

16:28.101 --> 16:30.600
It's your fault I have to work
at this stupid muffin store.

16:30.667 --> 16:32.134
But this place
was your dream!

16:32.200 --> 16:34.168
My real dream was
to be a teacher,

16:34.233 --> 16:36.233
and you got me fired!

16:36.300 --> 16:39.400
Now I'm up to my eyeballs
in debt with this stupid store,

16:39.467 --> 16:42.600
and four more muffin stores
just opened on this block!

16:49.767 --> 16:52.101
No!

16:52.168 --> 16:54.667
<i>But-But-But you found
The Answer!</i>

16:56.068 --> 16:58.834
No! I wrote a phone number
in there!

16:58.901 --> 17:01.801
No matter what you've done,
I always thought

17:01.867 --> 17:04.167
there was a spark of decency
in you, Bart Simpson,

17:04.233 --> 17:05.634
but I was wrong.

17:05.701 --> 17:08.034
I never thought
I'd say this to a child,

17:08.101 --> 17:11.733
but you are bad
on the inside.

17:11.800 --> 17:12.934
(gasps)

17:14.666 --> 17:15.767
(humming)

17:15.834 --> 17:18.767
Dad, am I bad on the inside?

17:18.834 --> 17:22.034
No... but the layers of bad
on your surface

17:22.101 --> 17:23.701
go almost all the way
to the center.

17:23.767 --> 17:27.200
But you think there's, like, a
kernel of good inside me, right?

17:27.267 --> 17:28.701
Hmm. I don't know.

17:28.767 --> 17:30.467
Kernels are kind of big.

17:30.534 --> 17:32.934
Oh! Listen, I was thinking.

17:35.534 --> 17:38.001
If someone did a really
bad thing to one teacher,

17:38.068 --> 17:40.567
and then did the same bad
thing to another teacher

17:40.634 --> 17:43.834
to get the first teacher her
job back, would it be okay?

17:43.901 --> 17:46.434
When you sayteacher,
do you really meanparent?

17:46.500 --> 17:48.267
No, I mean teacher.

17:48.333 --> 17:49.834
Great. Go nuts.

17:49.901 --> 17:52.168
But remember, we never
had this discussion.

17:52.233 --> 17:53.634
What discussion?

17:53.701 --> 17:55.168
The one we just had

17:55.233 --> 17:57.600
about you doing bad things,
you stupid kid!

17:57.667 --> 18:00.300
Oh.

18:25.001 --> 18:27.134
So, you see,
it was my fault.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.701
I got Mrs. Krabappel drunk.

18:28.767 --> 18:30.767
Then I was gonna do
the same thing to Zack,

18:30.834 --> 18:33.101
but I decided it was better
to just tell the truth.

18:33.168 --> 18:37.001
Bart, you deserve a reward
for telling the truth.

18:37.068 --> 18:39.901
And that reward will be in
the form of a severe punishment.

18:39.967 --> 18:42.734
Doesn't matter, as long
as Edna gets her job back.

18:42.801 --> 18:45.300
Sorry, Bart, but I can't just
get rid of a teacher

18:45.367 --> 18:46.767
if he's doing a good job.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.367
Or an adequate job.

18:48.434 --> 18:50.434
Or just shows up
and doesn't touch anyone.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.400
ZACK (chanting):
I hate children!

18:52.467 --> 18:54.233
I hate children!

18:54.300 --> 18:57.200
Children suck!
Children suck!

18:57.267 --> 19:01.834
What the...? Faculty lounge talk
out in the halls?!

19:01.901 --> 19:05.168
I hate children!
I hate children!

19:05.233 --> 19:07.600
You and you and you
and you and you!

19:07.667 --> 19:09.634
(slurring his speech):
You are wasting your lives.

19:09.701 --> 19:11.600
Hilary Swank didn't graduate
high school.

19:11.667 --> 19:13.233
She won two Oscars.

19:13.300 --> 19:16.400
And one of them she deserved.

19:16.467 --> 19:18.068
<i>Bart, you said you
didn't get him drunk.</i>

19:18.134 --> 19:19.834
I didn't. I swear!

19:19.901 --> 19:21.434
No, he's right.

19:21.500 --> 19:24.134
I mixed a little vodka
in with my Blue Bronco.

19:24.200 --> 19:28.200
Does anybody else want
to ride the indigo pony!

19:28.267 --> 19:29.967
Is there extra credit in it?

19:30.034 --> 19:33.168
Oh, they're gonna eat you alive
at Cal Tech, boy.

19:33.233 --> 19:35.134
Alive!

19:35.200 --> 19:36.567
(laughs)
Oh!

19:36.634 --> 19:38.300
Oh, yeah!

19:38.367 --> 19:40.168
* This place is a prison! *

19:40.233 --> 19:41.767
* Dow, dow *

19:41.834 --> 19:43.600
* All you kids are screwed! *

19:43.667 --> 19:45.168
* Dow, dow *

19:45.233 --> 19:46.767
* Kids and vodka! *

19:46.834 --> 19:48.300
Yeow!

19:48.367 --> 19:50.567
(laughing)

19:50.634 --> 19:53.168
It's always the good ones
that go crazy the fastest.

19:53.267 --> 19:55.034
Get off me!

19:55.101 --> 19:57.801
You can get rid of me, but you
can't get rid of the truth, man!

19:57.867 --> 20:00.034
This school is
a glorified hamster wheel

20:00.101 --> 20:02.168
run by incompetent bureaucrats

20:02.233 --> 20:03.901
who can get you
through a test,

20:03.967 --> 20:05.867
but you will fail
the test of life!

20:05.934 --> 20:08.467
Children, fingers in your ears
and make the la-la sound.

20:08.534 --> 20:10.901
* La-la, la-la,
la-la, la-la... *
Every class is a joke.

20:10.967 --> 20:12.767
English-- a joke,
homeroom-- a joke.

20:12.834 --> 20:14.634
Free period-- a joke.

20:14.701 --> 20:16.467
Nutritious
lunch-- a joke!

20:16.534 --> 20:18.567
Only alcohol can
make life bearable.

20:18.634 --> 20:21.101
You must drink!
Always drink!

20:24.500 --> 20:27.434
Well, class, I've got
to say I'm glad to be back.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.834
And there's no
hard feelings?
Nope.

20:29.901 --> 20:32.400
Now, everyone enjoy one
of my yummy muffins.

20:34.168 --> 20:36.734
But it's stale.
Eat the muffin.
