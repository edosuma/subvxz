[music playing]

00:11.597 --> 00:13.875
-Whoo!

00:13.910 --> 00:15.394
She's amazing!

00:15.429 --> 00:17.741
-She's so good!

00:17.776 --> 00:19.053
Go Kay!

00:21.538 --> 00:22.436
-Maddy.

00:22.470 --> 00:24.369
[cheers]

00:24.403 --> 00:27.234
-Yes!

00:27.268 --> 00:29.615
-Maddy.

00:29.650 --> 00:31.065
Tame it.

00:31.100 --> 00:33.826
[cheers]

00:33.861 --> 00:35.173
-Ow!

00:35.207 --> 00:36.691
-Dean Sumley was just
checking her out.

00:41.144 --> 00:41.869
-Maddy?

00:41.903 --> 00:43.422
-What's she doing?

00:43.457 --> 00:44.768
[cheers]

00:44.803 --> 00:46.701
MR. JEFFRIES [OFFSCREEN]:
Maddy Smith!

00:46.736 --> 00:47.840
Maddy!

00:50.636 --> 00:53.087
-Maddy can't dance.

00:53.122 --> 00:54.847
[cheers and applause]

00:54.882 --> 00:56.746
-Maddy!

00:56.780 --> 00:57.712
Maddy!

00:57.747 --> 00:58.679
-Maddy!

00:58.713 --> 00:59.645
Maddy!

00:59.680 --> 01:00.577
Maddy!

01:00.612 --> 01:01.544
Maddy!

01:01.578 --> 01:02.476
Maddy!

01:02.510 --> 01:03.442
Maddy!

01:03.477 --> 01:04.409
Maddy!

01:04.443 --> 01:05.410
Maddy!

01:05.444 --> 01:06.376
Maddy!

01:06.411 --> 01:06.825
Maddy!

01:06.859 --> 01:07.377
-Kay!

01:07.412 --> 01:07.791
Kay!

01:07.826 --> 01:08.344
Kay!

01:08.378 --> 01:08.792
Kay!

01:08.827 --> 01:09.379
-Maddy!

01:09.414 --> 01:09.828
Maddy!

01:09.862 --> 01:10.380
Maddy!

01:10.415 --> 01:10.863
Maddy!

01:10.898 --> 01:11.416
Maddy!

01:11.450 --> 01:11.899
Maddy!

01:11.933 --> 01:12.486
Maddy!

01:12.520 --> 01:15.385
[clapping]

01:15.420 --> 01:18.250
[whistle]

01:18.285 --> 01:19.424
-Did you see?

01:38.305 --> 01:40.169
THEME SONG: A promise
that I keep.

01:40.203 --> 01:42.481
I'll never share, I'll
never speak.

01:42.516 --> 01:46.313
To my grave the secret goes.

01:46.347 --> 01:49.212
The beating heart, the
beating heart.

01:49.247 --> 01:51.145
Where mystic creatures
wandered far.

01:51.180 --> 01:54.424
Through these veins
a wolfblood flows.

01:54.459 --> 01:59.809
Through these veins
a wolfblood flows.

01:59.843 --> 02:04.434
-Maddy Smith, despite that being
very entertaining, your

02:04.469 --> 02:06.816
behavior is totally
unacceptable.

02:06.850 --> 02:08.887
Acting out, it's not cool

02:08.920 --> 02:10.371
-That was cool, Maddy.

02:10.406 --> 02:10.889
-Yeah.

02:10.923 --> 02:12.373
Nice one.

02:12.408 --> 02:17.689
You're walking on very
thin ice, young lady.

02:17.723 --> 02:19.794
-You almost lost it.

02:19.829 --> 02:21.244
-I had it under control.

02:21.279 --> 02:21.831
-[scoffs].

02:21.865 --> 02:23.212
If you say so.

02:23.246 --> 02:25.973
After your first transformation,
it's crazy.

02:26.007 --> 02:28.493
You can wolf out in a second.

02:28.527 --> 02:29.804
-You need to lighten up.

02:29.839 --> 02:30.943
Nobody noticed.

02:30.978 --> 02:32.566
-Something happened
with her eyes.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.775
-Yeah, she went all doe-eyed
at Rhydian.

02:34.809 --> 02:36.466
SHANNON [OFFSCREEN]: Since when
can she street dance?

02:36.501 --> 02:37.812
That takes years of practice.

02:37.847 --> 02:38.744
-She's going out with him.

02:38.779 --> 02:39.262
It's obvious, right?

02:39.297 --> 02:39.849
-No!

02:39.883 --> 02:40.643
She's the beast!

02:40.677 --> 02:41.575
And he's in on it!

02:41.609 --> 02:41.989
-Shan!

02:42.023 --> 02:42.679
-No!

02:42.714 --> 02:44.371
Think about it!

02:44.405 --> 02:46.235
When she was dancing, her eyes
turned yellowy, just like they

02:46.269 --> 02:46.890
did in the fire.

02:46.925 --> 02:47.822
-[scoffs].

02:47.857 --> 02:48.582
-Look, it's all adding up!

02:54.967 --> 02:56.348
-Hi, Dean.

02:56.383 --> 02:57.211
I just wondered if you
wanted to come to a

02:57.246 --> 02:58.971
party on Friday night.

02:59.006 --> 03:00.283
-Um--

03:00.318 --> 03:01.733
-It's my birthday.

03:01.767 --> 03:04.770
-Don't really know what I'm
doing on Friday night.

03:04.805 --> 03:07.532
I'll catch you later.

03:07.566 --> 03:10.293
Hey, how's it going?

03:10.328 --> 03:11.984
-Yeah, fine thanks.

03:12.019 --> 03:12.675
How are you?

03:12.709 --> 03:14.504
-Yeah, I'm good.

03:14.539 --> 03:15.816
That was amazing earlier.

03:15.850 --> 03:18.474
I had no idea you were
into street dancing.

03:18.508 --> 03:19.233
-Yeah.

03:19.268 --> 03:21.373
Big time.

03:21.408 --> 03:22.512
I love all that.

03:22.547 --> 03:23.755
-Sweet.

03:23.789 --> 03:25.860
Well, I was wondering if
I could possibly get

03:25.895 --> 03:27.931
a lesson off you?

03:27.966 --> 03:29.381
-I don't know.

03:29.416 --> 03:30.865
It's all pretty instinctual.

03:30.900 --> 03:32.488
I don't know if I could
teach that stuff, so--

03:32.522 --> 03:34.041
-It's cool, but if you
change your mind.

03:36.940 --> 03:39.391
-He is not.

03:39.426 --> 03:40.565
-Don't worry, Kay.

03:40.599 --> 03:42.394
We can use this to
our advantage.

03:53.854 --> 03:56.339
-Kay wants to know if you want
to come to her birthday party.

03:56.374 --> 03:59.273
Everybody who's anybody's
gonna be there.

03:59.308 --> 04:00.550
-OK.

04:00.585 --> 04:02.103
-It's 8:30 on Friday.

04:02.138 --> 04:05.452
Wear something nice.

04:05.486 --> 04:06.625
-[laughs].

04:09.973 --> 04:10.802
-What are you doing?

04:10.836 --> 04:12.390
I don't want her there!

04:12.424 --> 04:13.632
-Right now she's your best hope
of getting Dean to the

04:13.667 --> 04:14.599
party.

04:14.633 --> 04:15.738
-But he fancies her, not me!

04:15.772 --> 04:16.670
-Leave it to us.

04:16.704 --> 04:17.843
[giggles].

04:21.813 --> 04:23.124
-OK, that was weird.

04:23.159 --> 04:25.092
Just been invited to Kay's
birthday party.

04:25.126 --> 04:27.888
-They invited me last week.

04:27.922 --> 04:29.407
-They didn't invite me.

04:29.441 --> 04:30.339
-Don't cry, Shannon.

04:30.373 --> 04:31.961
I didn't get invited either.

04:31.995 --> 04:32.824
-It's the onion, Tom.

04:32.858 --> 04:34.343
I couldn't care less.

04:34.377 --> 04:35.378
Neither does Maddy.

04:35.413 --> 04:36.621
She's not going.

04:36.655 --> 04:38.139
-Are you going?

04:38.174 --> 04:41.971
TOM [OFFSCREEN]: Um, it's
Shannon's movie night Friday.

04:42.005 --> 04:43.697
-No, I know.

04:43.731 --> 04:44.870
Wasn't gonna go.

04:50.704 --> 04:52.533
-What do you mean
you can't come?

04:52.568 --> 04:54.570
-I've got a movie night
with Shannon and Tom.

04:54.604 --> 04:55.881
I forgot.

04:55.916 --> 04:57.469
-But we were wondering if
you'd do your street

04:57.504 --> 04:58.746
dance at the party.

04:58.781 --> 05:00.645
Seriously, you were amazing.

05:00.679 --> 05:01.956
-I can't let me friends down.

05:05.097 --> 05:06.720
-We would really like it
if Tom and Shannon

05:06.754 --> 05:08.031
could come to the party.

05:08.066 --> 05:08.687
Wouldn't we, Kay?

05:08.722 --> 05:09.861
-Yes.

05:11.828 --> 05:12.726
-OK.

05:12.760 --> 05:14.072
I'll ask them.

05:14.106 --> 05:15.936
-Sweet.

05:15.970 --> 05:17.455
-What you doing?

05:17.489 --> 05:18.766
If she dances, I don't stand
a chance with Dean.

05:18.801 --> 05:20.630
-It's all part of the plan.

05:20.665 --> 05:22.114
-Guess what?

05:22.149 --> 05:23.944
You guys are invited
to the party too.

05:23.978 --> 05:24.738
We can all go.

05:24.772 --> 05:25.704
It'll be a laugh.

05:25.739 --> 05:26.705
-You're kidding, right?

05:26.740 --> 05:28.914
The Ks don't exactly like me.

05:28.949 --> 05:30.191
-That's not true!

05:30.226 --> 05:31.469
They just invited you.

05:31.503 --> 05:32.849
-Only so you'd go.

05:32.884 --> 05:34.989
'Cause you're suddenly
so popular.

05:35.024 --> 05:36.405
-Come on!

05:36.439 --> 05:38.510
I just want to have a bit
of fun for change.

05:38.545 --> 05:41.927
-So we don't have fun?

05:41.962 --> 05:42.997
-That's not what I meant.

05:43.032 --> 05:44.033
They're just trying
to be nice!

05:44.067 --> 05:45.862
-Oh come on, Maddy.

05:45.897 --> 05:47.174
Don't be so naive.

05:47.208 --> 05:48.071
-Naive?

05:48.106 --> 05:49.556
-Yeah.

05:49.590 --> 05:51.592
There's always some ulterior
motive with them.

05:51.627 --> 05:53.214
They don't actually like you.

05:53.249 --> 05:54.837
Today they think you're cool.

05:54.871 --> 05:56.908
Tomorrow you'll just be plain
old Maddy Smith again.

05:56.942 --> 05:58.461
-Well, do you know what?

05:58.496 --> 06:02.396
This plain old Maddy Smith is
gonna go to that party!

06:02.431 --> 06:06.642
So you can count me out
of movie night!

06:06.676 --> 06:08.229
-How was school?

06:08.264 --> 06:09.058
-Whatever.

06:09.092 --> 06:11.163
-Oh, someone's grumpy.

06:11.198 --> 06:12.544
-I'm not grumpy!

06:12.579 --> 06:14.408
Stop talking like I'm a baby!

06:14.443 --> 06:16.997
-Aw, does my little
cub want a cocoa?

06:17.031 --> 06:18.550
-I'm not a cub anymore!

06:18.585 --> 06:19.724
I'm a wolf!

07:15.193 --> 07:19.024
[bell ringing]

07:19.059 --> 07:20.716
-Who's the new--

07:20.750 --> 07:21.268
Maddy!

07:21.302 --> 07:22.787
-Maddy!

07:22.821 --> 07:23.960
MR. JEFFRIES [OFFSCREEN]: Maddy,
who dressed you this

07:23.995 --> 07:25.203
morning, out of interest?

07:25.237 --> 07:27.101
Lady Gaga?

07:27.136 --> 07:29.483
-Who dressed you this
morning, sir?

07:29.518 --> 07:30.726
Your grandma?

07:30.760 --> 07:34.281
[laughter]

07:34.315 --> 07:36.697
-Well, I don't know why you're
still sitting there.

07:36.732 --> 07:38.078
Get out.

07:49.054 --> 07:53.921
-It's like I'm seeing things
I never seen in her before.

07:53.956 --> 07:55.026
-Yeah.

07:55.060 --> 07:56.821
Hair extensions and
a bit of slap.

07:56.855 --> 07:59.720
-Miss Smith, this is science,
not a circus.

07:59.755 --> 08:00.514
-Yeah?

08:00.549 --> 08:02.240
I'm testing gravity.

08:02.274 --> 08:03.655
[smash]

08:03.690 --> 08:05.795
[laughter]

08:05.830 --> 08:08.349
-Oh look, it works.

08:08.384 --> 08:09.661
-Well, that was mature.

08:09.696 --> 08:11.111
-I'm not the one that
thinks there's a

08:11.145 --> 08:12.802
monster on the moors.

08:12.837 --> 08:14.148
How mature is that?

08:14.183 --> 08:15.253
-Yeah, freak.

08:15.287 --> 08:16.841
SHANNON [OFFSCREEN]:
Kara, be quiet.

08:16.875 --> 08:18.670
Maddy, you can clear that up and
come and see me at lunch

08:18.705 --> 08:19.706
time for detention.

08:19.740 --> 08:22.916
[laughter]

08:22.950 --> 08:24.262
-Running helps.

08:24.296 --> 08:25.677
-What?

08:25.712 --> 08:26.678
-After my first transformation,
I must have

08:26.713 --> 08:28.922
run a marathon at every state.

08:28.956 --> 08:29.888
-Sweet.

08:29.923 --> 08:30.371
Let's go.

08:30.406 --> 08:30.889
-What?

08:30.924 --> 08:31.372
Now?

08:31.407 --> 08:32.581
-Yeah.

08:32.615 --> 08:33.684
I'm not gonna do stupid
detention.

08:33.720 --> 08:34.823
I'll race you!

08:43.592 --> 08:47.181
-I'll bet she's got a favorite
spot out there, the moor.

08:47.216 --> 08:48.320
Secluded.

08:48.355 --> 08:49.390
-What's Rhydian got
that I haven't?

08:49.425 --> 08:50.944
-Maddy's trust.

08:50.978 --> 08:52.704
It's a dangerous
secret to hide.

08:52.739 --> 08:55.880
-It is pretty dangerous,
isn't it?

08:55.914 --> 08:57.122
Girls like that kind of stuff.

08:57.157 --> 08:59.953
The whole bad boy thing.

08:59.987 --> 09:01.057
-[in unison]

09:01.092 --> 09:01.851
It's time I found
out her secret.

09:16.659 --> 09:20.042
-The werewolf, sometimes known
as a lycanthrope, is a human

09:20.076 --> 09:26.358
with the ability to become a
wolf-like creature, whose

09:26.393 --> 09:31.018
transformation is often
associated with the full moon.

09:31.053 --> 09:33.883
In between these times, the
human may still display

09:33.918 --> 09:35.816
wolf-like behavior.

09:35.851 --> 09:36.955
-Ha!

09:39.061 --> 09:40.752
-Look, I get it.

09:40.787 --> 09:44.307
Right now it seems like nothing
matters but the wolf.

09:44.342 --> 09:46.827
You know, normal people can't
just street dance without

09:46.862 --> 09:48.035
practicing.

09:48.070 --> 09:49.312
Do you not think it
seemed a bit odd?

09:49.347 --> 09:50.728
You're just using your
powers to show off.

09:50.762 --> 09:52.074
-You sound like me.

09:52.108 --> 09:54.041
-Well, maybe you should
take your own advice.

09:54.076 --> 09:55.284
-You never do.

09:55.318 --> 09:57.424
-When this passes, you're gonna
want your friends back.

09:57.458 --> 09:58.943
-I've got friends, thanks.

10:03.810 --> 10:06.226
SHANNON [OFFSCREEN]: Wolves
are proud creatures, and

10:06.260 --> 10:07.883
constantly preen themselves.

10:20.171 --> 10:22.069
-OK, well, I'll see you.

10:29.767 --> 10:31.665
Dean's coming to the party.

10:31.700 --> 10:34.081
-O-M-G.

10:34.116 --> 10:35.496
-He's bringing a few mates.

10:35.531 --> 10:37.498
I thought you wouldn't
mind, Kay.

10:37.533 --> 10:38.430
-Mind?

10:38.465 --> 10:39.086
Dean's coming to my party!

10:39.121 --> 10:42.262
[giggles]

10:42.296 --> 10:43.919
I mean, that's cool.

10:46.404 --> 10:47.301
[singing]

10:47.336 --> 10:48.233
Dean's coming to my party!

10:48.268 --> 10:50.477
Dean's coming to my party!

10:50.511 --> 10:52.479
-Now we just have to tell Maddy
it's at the Village

10:52.513 --> 10:52.997
Hall.

10:53.031 --> 10:53.791
-Ew!

10:53.825 --> 10:54.964
The Village Hall?

10:54.999 --> 10:56.414
It's gross!

10:56.448 --> 10:59.279
-The party won't be there!

10:59.313 --> 11:00.038
-What?

11:00.073 --> 11:01.005
There's no party?

11:01.039 --> 11:02.523
-Yes, there will be a party.

11:02.558 --> 11:03.939
-At my house.

11:03.973 --> 11:05.803
-Well then, who'll be
at the Village Hall?

11:05.837 --> 11:06.942
-Maddy.

11:06.976 --> 11:08.046
-Why?

11:08.081 --> 11:09.427
-'Cause the party's
at Kay's house.

11:09.461 --> 11:11.084
-Where Dean will be!

11:11.118 --> 11:15.295
[laughs]

11:15.329 --> 11:16.468
-Cool.

11:20.058 --> 11:22.026
SHANNON [OFFSCREEN]: Wolves
are cunning predators, and

11:22.060 --> 11:23.786
will use anything to
their advantage.

11:23.821 --> 11:25.270
BECKY [OFFSCREEN]: You know
how I never come to any

11:25.305 --> 11:26.375
sleepovers?

11:26.409 --> 11:28.135
FEMALE STUDENT [OFFSCREEN]:
Yeah.

11:28.170 --> 11:30.034
BECKY [OFFSCREEN]: I'm really
embarrassed, but I kinda still

11:30.068 --> 11:31.242
wee the bed.

11:31.276 --> 11:32.830
FEMALE STUDENT [OFFSCREEN]:
You wet the bed?

11:32.864 --> 11:33.382
BECKY [OFFSCREEN]: It's only
when I have really bad

11:33.416 --> 11:34.901
nightmares.

11:34.935 --> 11:35.142
FEMALE STUDENT [OFFSCREEN]:
I won't tell anyone!

11:37.351 --> 11:38.145
-Becky?

11:38.180 --> 11:39.353
From our year Becky?

11:39.388 --> 11:40.216
-Yep.

11:40.251 --> 11:42.080
She still wets the bed.

11:42.115 --> 11:43.426
-Ew.

11:43.461 --> 11:45.843
That's the most disgusting
thing I've ever heard.

11:45.877 --> 11:47.327
I've got to tell everyone.

11:47.361 --> 11:48.569
[laughs].

11:48.604 --> 11:50.019
-Well, you can tell everyone
at the party.

11:50.054 --> 11:52.781
There's so many people going
now we've had to

11:52.815 --> 11:53.471
get a bigger venue.

11:53.505 --> 11:54.575
-The Village Hall.

11:54.610 --> 11:55.438
There's a stage and
everything.

11:55.473 --> 11:56.957
-Yeah.

11:56.992 --> 11:57.993
And everyone's dying to see
you street dance again.

11:58.027 --> 11:58.959
-Sweet.

11:58.994 --> 12:02.894
So Village Hall,
eight o'clock.

12:02.929 --> 12:04.171
-Nothing works.

12:04.206 --> 12:05.552
She hates me.

12:05.586 --> 12:07.071
I don't know how Rhydian got
her to go out with him.

12:07.105 --> 12:08.935
-Maybe he carries around a
supply of doggie chews.

12:08.969 --> 12:09.936
-[sighs]

12:09.970 --> 12:11.213
Don't start this again, Shan.

12:11.247 --> 12:12.317
SHOPKEEPER [OFFSCREEN]:
Girl trouble, is it?

12:12.352 --> 12:13.456
-You could say that.

12:13.491 --> 12:14.941
-Want my advice?

12:14.975 --> 12:16.252
-No.

12:16.287 --> 12:17.529
SHOPKEEPER [OFFSCREEN]:
Girls are like buses.

12:17.564 --> 12:18.945
-Why?

12:18.979 --> 12:21.085
-Well, they come along
every five minutes.

12:21.119 --> 12:22.362
-What's your point?

12:22.396 --> 12:23.812
SHOPKEEPER [OFFSCREEN]: Well,
just ask her out.

12:23.846 --> 12:26.090
If she says no, there'll
soon be another one.

12:26.124 --> 12:28.402
Except leaving Storybridge,
which in case they're twice a

12:28.437 --> 12:30.473
day and none on bank holidays.

12:30.508 --> 12:31.992
Here, use a timetable.

12:32.027 --> 12:33.166
It's only two quid.

12:33.200 --> 12:34.926
-So I should just ask her out?

12:34.961 --> 12:35.616
SHOPKEEPER [OFFSCREEN]: Yeah!

12:35.651 --> 12:37.032
-No, Tom!

12:37.066 --> 12:38.378
He's just trying to sell
you a bus timetable.

12:38.412 --> 12:39.620
-No, maybe he's right.

12:39.655 --> 12:41.208
Maybe I should just man
up and ask her out.

12:41.243 --> 12:42.244
-That's a terrible idea.

12:42.278 --> 12:43.624
-Good lad.

12:43.659 --> 12:46.075
Right, you're gonna need some
aftershave as well.

12:46.110 --> 12:46.904
[blows]

12:46.938 --> 12:47.801
Right, there you go.

12:47.836 --> 12:49.009
A fiver.

12:49.044 --> 12:51.494
And I'll throw in
the timetable.

12:51.529 --> 12:53.945
FEMALE STUDENT [OFFSCREEN]: I
swear, I didn't tell anyone!

12:53.980 --> 12:54.912
-You must have done.

12:54.946 --> 12:56.258
-I didn't!

12:56.292 --> 12:57.569
-I only told you, and now
the whole school knows!

13:04.369 --> 13:05.992
-I'll want to look like her.

13:06.026 --> 13:08.615
-That's Justin Bieber.

13:08.649 --> 13:09.892
-Can I have a word?

13:09.927 --> 13:11.445
-I'm with me friends.

13:11.480 --> 13:14.517
-Yeah well, your old friends
think that, they think you've

13:14.552 --> 13:16.140
turned into a bit
of a monster.

13:16.174 --> 13:20.454
We need to discuss
the developments.

13:20.489 --> 13:21.904
-Well, I'm not sure
we're getting the

13:21.939 --> 13:24.493
full "picture" here.

13:24.527 --> 13:26.184
-Come on, girls.

13:26.219 --> 13:28.600
Let's get out of the frame.

13:28.635 --> 13:29.981
-Something about photography.

13:32.673 --> 13:34.675
-What are they doing
in our darkroom?

13:34.710 --> 13:36.194
-Joined our club.

13:36.229 --> 13:37.506
-[coughing].

13:37.540 --> 13:39.370
-That's disgusting!

13:39.404 --> 13:40.923
KARA [OFFSCREEN]: That's
not aftershave.

13:40.958 --> 13:42.235
That's disinfectant!

13:42.269 --> 13:43.650
-Ugh!

13:43.684 --> 13:44.927
-I can do this!

13:54.557 --> 13:59.908
[breathing heavily]

13:59.942 --> 14:01.564
-Tom!

14:01.599 --> 14:03.014
-You're not just hurting
your friends!

14:03.049 --> 14:04.291
Becky's crying because
of you out there!

14:04.326 --> 14:05.361
-I was just having
a bit of fun!

14:05.396 --> 14:06.569
-Tom now thinks we're
going out!

14:06.604 --> 14:08.123
-Since when do you care
what Tom thinks?

14:08.157 --> 14:09.262
-Well, because it's dangerous.

14:09.296 --> 14:10.401
Shannon's certain you're
a werewolf!

14:10.435 --> 14:12.161
-I'm not a werewolf,
I'm a wolfblood!

14:12.196 --> 14:14.888
You've always taught
us to embrace it!

14:14.923 --> 14:16.441
[growling]

14:16.476 --> 14:19.030
-I finally understand what you
mean, and you're scared!

14:19.065 --> 14:20.549
-I'm not scared of anything!

14:20.583 --> 14:26.900
[growling]

14:26.935 --> 14:28.039
-Maddy, the door!

14:31.732 --> 14:33.493
-What are you doing?

14:33.527 --> 14:35.150
Are you spying on us?

14:35.184 --> 14:36.047
-No.

14:36.082 --> 14:37.117
I, I heard strange noises.

14:37.152 --> 14:38.222
-Kara's right.

14:38.256 --> 14:40.465
You are a freak!

14:40.500 --> 14:42.916
-I'm sorry, Shannon.

14:42.951 --> 14:44.055
Maddy!

14:47.714 --> 14:49.405
-Thanks very much, Maddy.

14:49.440 --> 14:50.234
-Yeah, thanks.

14:50.268 --> 14:51.614
-What?

14:51.649 --> 14:53.064
-The head's done a massive
crack down on makeup.

14:53.099 --> 14:54.997
-And someone's spreading
a vile rumor about me.

14:55.032 --> 14:55.964
-Nothing to do with me.

14:55.998 --> 14:57.551
-Liar!

14:57.586 --> 14:58.967
MR. JEFFRIES [OFFSCREEN]:
Maddy Smith!

14:59.001 --> 15:01.417
What on earth do you
think you're doing?

15:01.452 --> 15:03.557
-If you think you're going to
a party after the phone call

15:03.592 --> 15:06.008
we've just had from Mr.
Jeffries, you're severely

15:06.043 --> 15:07.078
mistaken, young lady.

15:07.113 --> 15:08.459
-You don't understand!

15:08.493 --> 15:11.945
I'm the reason everyone's going
to the Village Hall.

15:11.980 --> 15:13.464
-Well, they're going to be
sorely disappointed then,

15:13.498 --> 15:14.465
aren't they?

15:14.499 --> 15:15.569
Now do what your mother says.

15:15.604 --> 15:17.537
-No!

15:17.571 --> 15:18.296
[growls]

15:18.331 --> 15:19.401
-Oh, no you don't!

15:19.435 --> 15:21.472
Get to your room!

15:21.506 --> 15:23.750
-You're such boring old dogs!

15:23.784 --> 15:25.062
MARCUS [OFFSCREEN]: Maddy!

15:25.096 --> 15:30.274
[door slams]

15:30.308 --> 15:32.310
-What do I say if people
ask where Maddy is?

15:32.345 --> 15:33.691
Do I tell them she's at
the Village Hall?

15:33.725 --> 15:35.106
-No, Katrina.

15:35.141 --> 15:36.797
You just repeat the question
back to them.

15:36.832 --> 15:37.626
Works every time.

15:37.660 --> 15:39.076
-What do you mean?

15:39.110 --> 15:40.767
-What do you mean?

15:40.801 --> 15:42.113
-What do you mean?

15:42.148 --> 15:43.287
-What do you mean?

15:45.565 --> 15:47.429
-Wow, cool.

15:47.463 --> 15:52.192
[giggles]

15:52.227 --> 15:53.193
-You know what?

15:53.228 --> 15:54.436
You were right earlier, Maddy.

15:54.470 --> 15:55.747
-We are old dogs.

15:55.782 --> 15:57.611
-And we know all the tricks.

15:57.646 --> 15:59.579
Take it all off, Maddy.

15:59.613 --> 16:00.580
-This is abuse!

16:00.614 --> 16:02.168
I'm calling Child Line!

16:02.202 --> 16:03.341
-Night night.

16:10.452 --> 16:13.041
-She doesn't even
know I exist.

16:13.075 --> 16:14.835
-So are you planning on putting
on so much weight that

16:14.870 --> 16:16.147
she can't miss you?

16:19.392 --> 16:20.565
-I'm terrible with girls!

16:20.600 --> 16:22.119
I mean, Maddy would
never want me!

16:22.153 --> 16:23.741
-You don't want her!

16:23.775 --> 16:25.018
She's a monster!

16:26.744 --> 16:28.642
We have to go to this party.

16:28.677 --> 16:29.747
-What?

16:29.781 --> 16:31.300
No way!

16:31.335 --> 16:32.750
I'm not going to sit there
and watch her [inaudible]

16:32.784 --> 16:34.234
Rhydian, Shan!

16:34.269 --> 16:35.442
-No.

16:35.477 --> 16:37.720
You're going to help me
catch a werewolf.

16:37.755 --> 16:39.412
Look, Maddy's going to
be showing off her

16:39.446 --> 16:40.861
street dancing again.

16:40.896 --> 16:43.519
If her eyes change, this
could be my chance to

16:43.554 --> 16:45.694
prove she's not human.

16:45.728 --> 16:47.454
Now wait outside while
I get changed.

17:09.131 --> 17:10.236
[creak]

17:21.867 --> 17:23.111
-What?

17:23.145 --> 17:24.422
It's just a bit of makeup!

17:24.457 --> 17:26.528
-Makeup can make you look
that much better?

17:26.561 --> 17:28.737
-Wow, with compliments like
that, it's a wonder you're not

17:28.771 --> 17:30.325
surrounded by eager girls.

17:33.673 --> 17:35.502
Come on.

17:35.537 --> 17:36.883
[music playing]

17:44.477 --> 17:45.581
-He's nice.

18:01.425 --> 18:02.805
-How we doing?

18:02.840 --> 18:04.393
Wanna dance?

18:04.428 --> 18:05.567
-I don't dance.

18:07.914 --> 18:11.676
Have you seen Maddy?

18:11.711 --> 18:13.161
-Have you seen Maddy?

18:25.449 --> 18:27.244
-Time to get this
party started.

18:27.278 --> 18:29.936
[music playing]

18:29.970 --> 18:30.695
[record scratching]

18:30.730 --> 18:31.524
-Three, four.

18:31.558 --> 18:33.491
One, two, three, four.

18:33.526 --> 18:35.252
This way, ladies.

18:35.286 --> 18:36.598
One, two.

18:36.632 --> 18:37.978
This way, one.

18:38.013 --> 18:39.497
-Yeehaw!

18:39.532 --> 18:41.361
Maddy'll be going down with
the oldies about now!

18:41.396 --> 18:43.708
-And if she comes here
for a showdown after?

18:43.743 --> 18:44.916
-She'll be too embarrassed.

18:44.951 --> 18:47.160
Anyway, the Village
Hall's miles away.

18:47.195 --> 18:48.299
She won't show up tonight.

18:52.786 --> 18:55.272
[growling]

19:01.381 --> 19:02.313
-Hi, Dean.

19:02.348 --> 19:02.969
-Hi.

19:03.003 --> 19:03.970
-What do you think?

19:04.004 --> 19:05.558
-Yeah, it's, it's, it's cool.

19:08.906 --> 19:09.562
-[giggling]

19:09.596 --> 19:10.563
She's gorgeous.

19:14.636 --> 19:15.878
-Girls are weird, man.

19:19.261 --> 19:21.505
-Hi, Tom.

19:21.539 --> 19:24.715
-Why do girls suddenly
fancy me?

19:24.749 --> 19:25.888
-Where is she?

19:32.585 --> 19:35.898
-Sadly, Maddy had another
dancing engagement tonight.

[crowd groans]

19:36.934 --> 19:37.555
-Shh!

19:37.590 --> 19:38.798
-Whatever.

19:38.832 --> 19:41.318
-But we have something
even better for you.

19:41.352 --> 19:43.975
Kay and her amazing street
dancing moves!

Let's just go.

Go Kay!

20:18.872 --> 20:21.703
Whoo!

-She's gonna dance!

20:23.636 --> 20:24.740
-What are you doing?

20:24.775 --> 20:26.466
-I'm gonna show Kay
who's top dog!

20:26.501 --> 20:27.571
-Are you crazy?

20:27.605 --> 20:28.399
You almost transformed
last time!

20:31.747 --> 20:32.679
-So.

20:32.714 --> 20:33.749
Think you can copy me look?

20:33.784 --> 20:35.682
Let's see you copy this.

-Oh!

21:53.657 --> 21:59.352
[laughter]

21:59.387 --> 22:01.699
-This is the worst
birthday ever!

22:01.734 --> 22:03.080
-Look at what you've
done, Maddy!

22:03.114 --> 22:05.600
Stealing Kay's limelight at
her own birthday party!

22:05.634 --> 22:08.810
That's low.

22:08.844 --> 22:10.363
MADDY [OFFSCREEN]: Move
out of the way!

22:17.957 --> 22:19.441
KAY [OFFSCREEN]: Go away!

22:19.476 --> 22:20.373
-Kay, I'm sorry.

22:20.408 --> 22:21.201
KAY [OFFSCREEN]: Get lost!

22:21.236 --> 22:22.375
You ruined my birthday!

22:22.410 --> 22:23.445
-You brought it on yourself.

22:23.480 --> 22:24.653
You sent us to the
wrong place!

22:29.796 --> 22:31.660
-What you doing in here?

22:31.695 --> 22:33.075
-Looking for chocolate.

22:33.110 --> 22:35.975
-Ugh, this place is sucking
the life force out of me.

22:36.009 --> 22:39.116
Let's just go.

22:39.150 --> 22:41.152
-[gags].

22:41.187 --> 22:42.499
-What is it?

22:42.533 --> 22:43.189
What's wrong?

22:43.223 --> 22:44.742
-Too much chocolate!

22:44.777 --> 22:45.950
-You keep that in.

22:45.985 --> 22:47.849
You cannot do that in here!

22:47.883 --> 22:49.713
Come on.

22:49.747 --> 22:50.645
-[retching].

22:50.679 --> 22:51.956
-Ugh!

22:51.991 --> 22:53.406
KAY [OFFSCREEN]: Look.

22:53.441 --> 22:54.614
I'm sorry, OK?

22:54.649 --> 22:56.961
I was just desperate
to get Dean here.

22:56.996 --> 22:58.653
-You used us.

22:58.687 --> 22:59.895
-I've always fancied him.

22:59.930 --> 23:02.070
Then you take over my dance
in assembly and

23:02.104 --> 23:03.485
he's all over you?

23:03.520 --> 23:04.762
-He was only asking us
for dance lessons.

23:04.797 --> 23:06.074
I don't fancy him.

23:06.108 --> 23:07.213
-[gags]

23:07.247 --> 23:08.732
'Cause she's going
out with Rhydian.

23:08.766 --> 23:10.216
-Shh.

23:10.250 --> 23:12.908
KAY [OFFSCREEN]: Yeah, but he
fancies you 'cause you're an

23:12.943 --> 23:13.737
awesome dancer.

23:13.771 --> 23:15.980
-I'm a terrible dancer.

23:16.015 --> 23:16.947
It, it was Rhydian.

23:16.981 --> 23:18.604
He's been teaching us.

23:18.638 --> 23:20.847
-Rhydian can't street dance.

23:20.882 --> 23:22.090
-No, I swear.

23:22.124 --> 23:23.505
Every spare second.

23:23.540 --> 23:26.612
Up on the moors, in
the darkroom.

23:26.646 --> 23:29.097
People actually starting to
think we're going out.

23:29.131 --> 23:29.925
As if.

23:29.960 --> 23:31.617
-They're not going out!

23:31.651 --> 23:32.652
-Told you.

23:32.687 --> 23:34.102
-[retches].

23:34.136 --> 23:36.863
KAY [OFFSCREEN]: It's just, I've
got no self confidence.

23:36.898 --> 23:39.141
I mean, all my life.

23:39.176 --> 23:40.246
-You all right, babes?

23:40.280 --> 23:42.144
-Dean's asking after you.

23:42.179 --> 23:43.594
-Shut up!

23:43.629 --> 23:44.077
-Kay!

23:44.112 --> 23:45.907
Your top!

23:45.941 --> 23:46.908
-No, Kay!

23:46.942 --> 23:49.255
Don't!

23:49.289 --> 23:53.017
-O-M-G. What are you
doing in my room?

23:53.052 --> 23:54.156
-You freaks!

23:57.194 --> 23:58.022
-You know what?

23:58.057 --> 23:59.161
They might be freaks.

24:02.233 --> 24:04.512
But they're my freaks.

24:04.546 --> 24:05.651
Come on.

24:10.172 --> 24:11.277
-Geek.

24:13.590 --> 24:18.180
[laughing]

24:18.215 --> 24:20.182
-What were you doing
in Kay's bedroom?

24:20.217 --> 24:21.770
Are you two going out?

24:21.805 --> 24:23.910
-No, no, no.

24:23.945 --> 24:25.049
-You look great, Shan.

24:25.084 --> 24:26.706
-I have got to get out
of this stuff.

24:26.741 --> 24:27.604
-Me too.

24:27.638 --> 24:29.053
I can't stand it anymore.

24:29.088 --> 24:31.504
And I'm grounded.

24:31.539 --> 24:34.334
[screams]

24:34.369 --> 24:35.094
-Run!

24:35.128 --> 24:37.890
And run, run, run!
