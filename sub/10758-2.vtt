00:16.265 --> 00:17.976
Oh, thank you.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.294
That was a very childish prank.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.671
Now you have ruined my coffee.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.339
If you can't behave like adults,

00:48.548 --> 00:50.216
you shouldn't be coming
to a grown-up cafe.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.634
It wasn't us.

00:55.346 --> 00:56.806
Aren't you gonna yell at them?

00:57.682 --> 01:00.435
I'm sure they already heard me
yell at you.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.646
Niles, thank you for agreeing
to meet me on such short notice.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.565
I swear I'm in full-blown crisis.

01:05.815 --> 01:10.320
If you're talking about that garish belt,
I have emergency suspenders.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.155
It's not the belt.

01:12.989 --> 01:16.409
My high school reunion is tonight
and you know my history.

01:16.659 --> 01:19.662
- Oh, not this folderol again.
- It's not folderol.

01:19.871 --> 01:21.581
- It's folderol.
- It's not folderol at all.

01:21.831 --> 01:24.292
For God's sake, Niles.
Every time my reunion comes around,

01:24.500 --> 01:26.627
it coincides with a severe downturn
in my life.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.212
Five years ago, Lilith divorced me.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.298
Five years before that,
I was left at the altar.

01:30.506 --> 01:33.426
Five years before that,
I fell face first into the poison ivy.

01:33.843 --> 01:37.305
And here we are, right on schedule,
I'm freshly fired.

01:37.555 --> 01:40.224
I still don't know why you even went
that poison-ivy year.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.768
Niles, the point is, in ten minutes,

01:42.977 --> 01:44.979
I have an extremely important
job interview,

01:45.187 --> 01:47.440
a job for which
I am eminently qualified,

01:47.648 --> 01:49.859
but that now
I have no chance of getting.

01:50.109 --> 01:52.069
Well, how can you know that?

01:52.320 --> 01:53.779
Because destiny won't allow it.

01:53.988 --> 01:56.490
Destiny's plan is for me
to walk into that reunion this evening

01:56.699 --> 01:59.243
the way I always do,
the class loser.

02:00.327 --> 02:01.954
Pitied and shunned by everyone

02:02.163 --> 02:05.082
until I wind up sitting
with the most pathetic people there.

02:08.002 --> 02:11.380
You mean, the chess club?

02:11.630 --> 02:13.174
Worse.

02:13.382 --> 02:16.594
The chess club's
barbershop quartet.

02:17.094 --> 02:19.638
Oh, the Check Mates.

02:19.889 --> 02:23.100
I swear to God,
I feel like I have a curse on my head.

02:23.350 --> 02:27.146
Frasier, you're a man of science.
You know curses don't exist.

02:27.354 --> 02:29.690
There's a perfectly rational explanation
for all of this.

02:29.898 --> 02:31.734
You tripped
and fell into the poison ivy.

02:31.942 --> 02:35.279
Your radio station changed formats.
Your wife didn't love you.

02:35.529 --> 02:36.530
If this is a pep talk,

02:36.739 --> 02:39.992
would you kindly segue
to the peppy part?

02:41.493 --> 02:43.954
Thank you very much. Thank you.

02:44.496 --> 02:47.583
The only reason you're giving credence
to this curse mumbo-jumbo

02:47.791 --> 02:49.585
is you're nervous
about your job interview.

02:49.835 --> 02:52.296
But you're a talented professional.

02:52.546 --> 02:55.382
Any station would be lucky
to have you, wouldn't they?

02:56.133 --> 02:59.469
- Yes, I suppose.
- So stop doubting yourself.

02:59.720 --> 03:02.180
You deserve that job,
so go out there and get it.

03:02.389 --> 03:03.932
In an hour's time, it'll be yours,

03:04.141 --> 03:06.435
and after a short trip to the store
to return that belt,

03:06.643 --> 03:08.353
you can thoroughly enjoy
your reunion.

03:09.521 --> 03:11.064
Well, you're right, Niles.

03:11.315 --> 03:13.150
I should think positively.

03:13.358 --> 03:16.486
This interview is gonna go just fine,
and so is this evening.

03:16.737 --> 03:19.406
All I have to do now is get a date.
Where am I gonna find a woman

03:19.573 --> 03:21.116
who is so desperate
for an evening out

03:21.283 --> 03:23.326
that she'd agree
to go to someone else's reunion?

03:23.535 --> 03:24.744
Oh, hey, Frasier.

03:25.078 --> 03:27.164
See? Your luck's changing already.

03:36.339 --> 03:37.465
Hello.

03:37.674 --> 03:40.343
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Steven Rugly's office.

03:40.510 --> 03:42.804
- Well, you've come to the right place.
- Oh, splendid.

03:43.054 --> 03:45.473
Is it possible to fetch me a coffee
before my interview?

03:45.724 --> 03:47.267
- Well...
- Better yet,

03:47.517 --> 03:49.894
make it a cup of chamomile tea
with a squirt of lemon

03:50.103 --> 03:52.689
and a full teaspoonful of honey.

03:52.939 --> 03:56.568
We'll try to get that for you just as soon
as my assistant gets back.

03:56.776 --> 04:00.280
I'm Steven Rugly,
president of KJMC.

04:00.530 --> 04:02.782
Oh, Lord, I'm... It's nice to meet you.

04:02.991 --> 04:04.993
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Quite all right, Dr. Crane.

04:05.201 --> 04:06.995
- It's a great suit, by the way.
- Thank you.

04:07.203 --> 04:09.080
- Your...
- I know.

04:09.330 --> 04:12.250
It's a bit risky. People have been
commenting on it all day.

04:12.458 --> 04:17.797
Yes, it makes a bold statement,
but frankly, I like the attention.

04:18.798 --> 04:20.591
I cut through the park
on the way over here.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.261
It caught the eye
of many a young lady.

04:24.929 --> 04:27.348
Oh, my God. My fly.

04:27.807 --> 04:29.434
I thought you were talking
about my belt.

04:29.642 --> 04:31.686
Well, shall we start the interview?

04:31.936 --> 04:34.856
Oh, good.
We haven't started yet. Well...

04:36.441 --> 04:39.527
I'm glad you could make it, Dr. Crane.
I've enjoyed your work.

04:39.735 --> 04:42.738
Oh, that's very gracious of you,
Mr. Ugly.

04:45.032 --> 04:47.785
- That didn't come out right, did it?
- What do you mean?

04:47.994 --> 04:50.997
The way I said your name right now
sounded like I called you Mr. Ugly.

04:51.205 --> 04:52.582
I assure you it won't happen again.

04:52.790 --> 04:54.917
See, it's just a matter
of separating the Rs.

04:55.126 --> 04:56.585
Mr. Rug.

04:56.836 --> 04:58.087
Mr. Rug.

04:58.337 --> 05:00.298
Mr. Rug.

05:03.009 --> 05:06.053
Ly. Mr. Rugly.

05:07.179 --> 05:10.182
Anyway, I think
you might be a good fit here.

05:10.391 --> 05:12.518
We need to find a replacement
for Dr. Wendy.

05:12.768 --> 05:13.936
- Really?
- Yes.

05:14.186 --> 05:16.439
I didn't feel it was right
to keep her on any longer.

05:16.689 --> 05:20.568
Well, let me say I applaud
your judgement on that score.

05:20.985 --> 05:23.654
I mean, frankly,
Dr. Wendy's saccharine style

05:23.821 --> 05:28.242
is maybe very popular, but, you know,
really not up to your standards, is it?

05:28.492 --> 05:30.077
Dr. Wendy's my mother.

05:32.162 --> 05:33.831
- She's quite ill.
- Oh, well...

05:34.164 --> 05:35.874
- Can I interrupt?
- Oh, please.

05:36.083 --> 05:37.459
You have some messages.

05:37.668 --> 05:39.420
- Excuse me for a moment.
- Of course.

05:39.628 --> 05:42.381
- Mr. Jameson has to cancel.
- Oh, very well.

05:42.589 --> 05:45.342
Why don't you call Phyllis Monderer
and see if she can reschedule?

05:45.509 --> 05:47.302
Don't forget to pick up my car
from the shop.

05:47.511 --> 05:49.138
I already did. It's across the street.

05:49.346 --> 05:51.932
Some idiot parked his BMW
in your space.

05:52.141 --> 05:54.893
- Well, have it towed.
- I already made the call.

05:55.102 --> 05:56.270
And can you call Walter Hecht

05:56.478 --> 05:59.231
and see if he can reschedule
for Wednesday?

06:04.653 --> 06:06.196
- Dr. Crane?
- Yes.

06:07.281 --> 06:09.491
We don't have any tea,
but would you like some coffee?

06:09.741 --> 06:12.411
Oh, that would be splendid.
Yes, thank you.

06:19.668 --> 06:23.547
- Everything all right?
- Yes, just fine, thank you.

06:25.924 --> 06:28.176
- What's that?
- Nothing.

06:29.594 --> 06:32.639
- Is this the giraffe from my bookcase?
- Yes, yes, it is. I'm sorry.

06:32.889 --> 06:35.225
I was admiring it.
It broke apart in my hands.

06:35.433 --> 06:36.977
But if your child
is anything like mine,

06:37.185 --> 06:38.812
he'd be delighted
to make you a new one.

06:39.020 --> 06:42.482
Actually, my father made it
after his stroke.

06:45.485 --> 06:47.112
Well, I think you've got enough
to go on.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.406
It was lovely meeting you.

06:50.448 --> 06:52.158
I'm sorry, you know,
I'm gonna have to dash

06:52.325 --> 06:54.536
if I'm gonna beat that tow truck.

07:00.834 --> 07:03.211
Hold the elevator.

07:03.420 --> 07:04.671
- Thanks.
- Hello, Dad.

07:04.879 --> 07:06.339
Hi.

07:07.298 --> 07:10.468
I'm never going to that grocery store
across the street again.

07:10.718 --> 07:13.012
They gave me such a hard time
because I brought Eddie in.

07:13.263 --> 07:14.722
Oh, well.

07:14.889 --> 07:16.599
It's not exactly sanitary, Dad.

07:16.808 --> 07:18.434
When they get rid
of the guy with pinkeye

07:18.643 --> 07:22.397
who's handing out cheese samples,
they can talk to me about sanitary.

07:27.944 --> 07:31.030
Wait a minute. Didn't you bring home
a case of dog food yesterday?

07:31.239 --> 07:32.699
Yeah, it was the economy stuff.

07:32.865 --> 07:35.034
He wouldn't touch it,
so I gotta take all this back.

07:35.243 --> 07:36.703
This is his favourite kind.

07:37.161 --> 07:38.621
Well, I guess what they say is true:

07:38.830 --> 07:41.916
Once you've tasted animal byproducts,
you can't go back to the cheap stuff.

07:43.251 --> 07:45.044
Hey, have you picked
a restaurant for tonight?

07:45.253 --> 07:46.546
I've got a better idea than that.

07:46.754 --> 07:49.215
My old precinct's having
one of their seized-property auctions

07:49.423 --> 07:50.424
down at the fairgrounds.

07:50.675 --> 07:53.636
- Oh, what's the better idea?
- Oh, now, come on, Niles.

07:53.886 --> 07:56.806
These drug dealers
have some pretty nice stuff.

07:57.390 --> 08:01.143
As much as I've been searching
for a wide-brimmed, purple velvet hat,

08:01.352 --> 08:03.479
- it's really not my cup of tea.
- I'll tell you what.

08:03.688 --> 08:06.983
We'll just go for a little while and then
we'll come back here for dinner.

08:07.233 --> 08:08.609
Am I glad you're home.

08:08.818 --> 08:10.820
- What's wrong?
- It's Dr. Crane.

08:11.070 --> 08:12.697
Since he came back
from his job interview,

08:12.905 --> 08:14.115
he's seemed awfully depressed.

08:14.323 --> 08:16.158
In fact, he's as bad
as I've ever seen him.

08:16.409 --> 08:18.452
- Oh, I guess it didn't go well?
- I gather not.

08:18.702 --> 08:20.329
He mumbled something about it
being worse

08:20.538 --> 08:23.582
<i>than the Dresden premiere
of Schumann's 2nd Symphony.</i>

08:23.833 --> 08:26.168
And you left him alone?

08:26.794 --> 08:27.920
Where is he?

08:28.170 --> 08:29.338
He's in the kitchen.

08:33.049 --> 08:34.927
Oh, my God!

08:36.971 --> 08:39.472
- Frasier, are you all right?
- I was fine before you screamed.

08:39.682 --> 08:42.433
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Daphne said you were depressed.

08:42.601 --> 08:44.144
Here you are
with your head in the oven.

08:44.395 --> 08:48.691
I was cleaning it, Niles. It's electric.

08:51.860 --> 08:53.028
If I was going to end my life,

08:53.237 --> 08:55.114
I'd choose something
quicker than broiling.

08:58.534 --> 09:00.410
Sorry your interview
didn't go well, Fras.

09:00.661 --> 09:01.829
Oh, that's all right, Dad.

09:02.037 --> 09:05.457
You know, things don't work out
the way we'd like them to sometimes,

09:05.666 --> 09:06.667
much like my strict

09:06.875 --> 09:10.003
"no shopping carts
in the apartment" policy.

09:10.504 --> 09:11.797
Don't worry about it.

09:12.047 --> 09:14.800
I'll take it back, but I need it
to return all that cheap dog food.

09:14.967 --> 09:17.302
I'm going to pick up
cleaning supplies, I'll do it for you.

09:17.511 --> 09:19.388
I thought you need to get ready
for the reunion.

09:19.596 --> 09:20.973
Oh, God, no. I'm not going.

09:21.181 --> 09:22.891
- Why?
- Because I'm cursed.

09:23.058 --> 09:25.560
If I wasn't convinced of it
before today's interview, I am now.

09:25.769 --> 09:27.062
You haven't even heard anything.

09:27.270 --> 09:29.564
For all you know,
you might've gotten it.

09:30.524 --> 09:32.067
Believe me, Dad,

09:32.275 --> 09:37.114
I have a better chance
of being crowned Miss Teen U.S.A.

09:38.115 --> 09:39.115
Oh, dear God.

09:39.324 --> 09:43.161
- Just how casual is this thing tonight?
- Roz, I am so sorry.

09:43.370 --> 09:46.373
I completely forgot to call
and tell you that, well, we're not going.

09:47.541 --> 09:48.667
Wait a second.

09:48.875 --> 09:52.671
I found a babysitter at the last minute.
I got a new dress.

09:52.921 --> 09:55.215
I got Miguel to do my hair,
and I just spent the last hour

09:55.423 --> 09:58.343
listening to the Estée Lauder lady
describe her bladder operation

09:58.510 --> 10:01.096
just so I could get a free makeover.

10:01.304 --> 10:03.765
- And now you say we're not going?
- Roz, I can't go.

10:03.973 --> 10:06.810
You see,
I have a curse on my head.

10:07.018 --> 10:08.019
What curse?

10:08.228 --> 10:11.564
He thinks the Fates are conspiring
to humiliate him at every reunion.

10:11.815 --> 10:13.650
Come on,
you don't really believe that, do you?

10:13.858 --> 10:17.695
All right, let's examine the evidence.
Daphne, will you assist me, please?

10:17.946 --> 10:19.906
This is my school newsletter.

10:20.114 --> 10:21.908
<i>"The Bryce Academy Crier."</i>

10:22.158 --> 10:25.620
Which, coincidentally, was Frasier's
nickname his first year there.

10:28.164 --> 10:32.835
Just read it. Scott Alexander.
What's he been up to?

10:33.294 --> 10:36.756
"Wife, kids, has his own
computer-software business."

10:37.006 --> 10:38.633
Nancy Kearns.

10:40.259 --> 10:43.346
"Mother of three,
successful physician,

10:43.554 --> 10:46.390
has invented a drug that may aid
in the treatment of cancer."

10:47.683 --> 10:49.894
Cure for cancer.

10:52.313 --> 10:54.148
Won't they be green with envy
when I trump them

10:54.357 --> 10:56.734
with this little story about my life?

10:56.943 --> 10:58.319
Frasier Crane,

10:58.569 --> 11:03.032
unattached, unemployed
and living with his father.

11:03.908 --> 11:06.994
He spends his days
scrubbing his oven

11:07.161 --> 11:11.499
and is anxiously awaiting
his upcoming tooth-cleaning.

11:12.249 --> 11:14.919
Now, now, Frasier,
everyone has ups and downs.

11:15.086 --> 11:18.506
You know, for all we know, that
cure for cancer didn't pan out either.

11:21.675 --> 11:23.594
One can only hope, Dad.

11:27.223 --> 11:30.434
I'll bet if you went in there with a sunny
attitude, you'd have a good time.

11:30.643 --> 11:33.395
You know, I tried sunny last time.
You know where it got me?

11:33.562 --> 11:37.233
Table 97, singing
"Goodbye, My Coney Island Baby"

11:37.441 --> 11:39.985
with the Check Mates.

11:40.694 --> 11:43.614
- Maybe this time will be different.
- That's the mistake I always make.

11:43.781 --> 11:46.450
Thinking this year, it'll be different.
That I can beat the curse.

11:46.617 --> 11:50.162
That's what the curse does. It makes
you think you can beat it, but you can't.

11:50.913 --> 11:55.876
I'm sorry, Roz. I apologize.
I will make this up to you someday.

11:56.085 --> 11:58.295
Right now, I am going
to go down to the store

11:58.504 --> 12:00.506
and run a little errand
for my friend, Eddie.

12:02.007 --> 12:04.259
Tonight, I'll be coming back home

12:04.468 --> 12:06.637
and spending the evening
with Daphne,

12:06.887 --> 12:08.639
doing some light housework

12:08.889 --> 12:11.892
and listening to my brand-new
book on tape:

12:12.059 --> 12:13.810
<i>Depression, Anxiety and Death.</i>

12:14.019 --> 12:17.689
As read by the author himself,
Stanislav Monk.

12:18.690 --> 12:20.400
Now who's cursed?

12:35.040 --> 12:38.043
Excuse me, sir, there's a place
to recycle those cans right over there.

12:38.293 --> 12:40.003
Oh, I know.

12:41.963 --> 12:45.217
On behalf of Mother Earth,
I thank you.

12:51.348 --> 12:54.184
That's the sort of person
that drinks chocolate soda.

12:57.896 --> 13:00.899
Come on, gotcha.

13:01.566 --> 13:03.735
Frasier Crane?

13:03.985 --> 13:05.528
Yes.

13:05.737 --> 13:08.948
Percy Williams.
Well, good to see you.

13:09.157 --> 13:10.992
Suppose you're on your way
to the reunion.

13:11.201 --> 13:13.244
Yes. Yes, I am.

13:13.453 --> 13:14.829
Couldn't make it this year myself.

13:14.996 --> 13:17.165
Little too much on my plate.
Things have gotten crazy.

13:17.373 --> 13:19.000
I can see that.

13:19.709 --> 13:21.586
Well, I heard
you weren't on the radio.

13:21.836 --> 13:22.837
Oh, you did?

13:23.379 --> 13:25.215
You know,
my wife heads up a charity

13:25.423 --> 13:27.467
that helps get homeless people
back on their feet.

13:27.675 --> 13:29.385
Yes, I know.
The Boot Strap Foundation.

13:29.552 --> 13:31.095
It's very popular in my circle.

13:31.304 --> 13:33.973
You should call them.
They could help you.

13:34.349 --> 13:36.059
Me?

13:39.395 --> 13:42.231
You know, this is very funny.
The shopping cart, the dog food.

13:42.398 --> 13:45.526
I'm afraid you're suffering
from the wrong impression.

13:45.735 --> 13:46.736
Dog food?

13:46.986 --> 13:49.655
Oh, it's not mine. It's my father's.

13:51.115 --> 13:52.116
Call them, Frasier.

13:52.366 --> 13:55.536
No, no. Really, you're mistaken.
I'm not homeless.

13:55.787 --> 13:58.790
I live in that luxury building right there,
Number 1901.

13:58.998 --> 14:01.667
- Frasier, please, take this.
- I don't need it.

14:01.876 --> 14:04.712
I drive a BMW. I collect African art.

14:05.129 --> 14:06.672
You always were a proud one.

14:06.881 --> 14:08.799
- I'm not proud.
- Then take it.

14:09.508 --> 14:13.471
And for God's sakes,
spend it on food.

14:14.555 --> 14:18.017
I just threw out a $200 belt.

14:38.871 --> 14:40.164
Hey, how was the police auction?

14:40.372 --> 14:42.958
You didn't miss anything,
especially once it started raining.

14:43.209 --> 14:45.878
I made out like a bandit.
Oh, look at this.

14:48.464 --> 14:50.925
Those drug lords
have the most incredible taste.

14:51.175 --> 14:55.095
Christofle silver, Limoges,
Orrefors crystal.

14:55.304 --> 14:57.973
If I ever get married again,
I'm going to register there.

14:59.892 --> 15:01.643
- Hello, all.
- Hey.

15:02.061 --> 15:05.147
- I thought you were staying home.
- Yes, well, not anymore.

15:05.355 --> 15:07.483
I ran into Percy Williams
down at the grocery store.

15:07.691 --> 15:10.110
He mistook me for a street person.

15:10.360 --> 15:12.070
If I don't go down there
and defend myself,

15:12.237 --> 15:15.824
he'll be passing around that rumour
along with the Swedish meatballs.

15:16.575 --> 15:17.868
I'm glad you're going, Dr. Crane.

15:18.076 --> 15:19.786
You'll have a nice time
and you look great.

15:19.995 --> 15:20.996
Thank you.

15:22.831 --> 15:25.250
You have no idea
how big you owe me.

15:25.459 --> 15:26.460
Yes, I do, Roz.

15:26.668 --> 15:28.920
I will never ask you
for another favour again except,

15:29.129 --> 15:30.589
could you do something
with your hair?

15:30.797 --> 15:33.008
It seems to be leaning.

15:33.675 --> 15:34.843
Frasier, when you called,

15:35.052 --> 15:36.762
I was in the tub
with a pint of Häagen-Dazs.

15:36.970 --> 15:39.514
Considering that was 15 minutes ago,
I think I look pretty good.

15:39.723 --> 15:41.266
And I appreciate it, Roz. I really do.

15:41.433 --> 15:43.435
Daphne, could you please
help Roz getting finished?

15:43.643 --> 15:46.188
- I'm finished.
- No, no, no. Finish more. Come on.

15:46.396 --> 15:49.232
- And remember what I told you.
- Oh, yeah, right.

15:49.483 --> 15:52.903
I'm a model-slash-doctor-slash-
daughter of the duke of Luxembourg.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.071
Yeah, come along, Your Grace.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.325
Frasier?

15:58.950 --> 16:01.453
Are you so desperate that
you're trying to impress these people

16:01.661 --> 16:04.414
by having Roz pretend
to be some sort of trophy girlfriend?

16:04.664 --> 16:06.041
Trophy duchess.

16:07.751 --> 16:09.544
Niles, it's the only way
to beat the curse.

16:09.711 --> 16:12.088
You could beat the curse
by not going.

16:12.297 --> 16:14.215
I tried that, Niles.
You see where it got me.

16:14.466 --> 16:16.968
<i>The curse found a way to humiliate me
in absentia.</i>

16:17.177 --> 16:18.803
I've got to get down there.

16:19.012 --> 16:23.141
Why? In order to win the approval
of a group of virtual strangers?

16:23.725 --> 16:26.811
- I know it sounds foolish, Niles...
- No, no, it's not foolish.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.229
It's human.

16:29.063 --> 16:31.900
I think it's all about
the feelings of inferiority

16:32.066 --> 16:34.110
you've been carrying with you
since high school.

16:34.319 --> 16:35.570
That's the real curse.

16:36.112 --> 16:37.739
Only you're not
the Bryce Crier anymore.

16:37.989 --> 16:38.990
You're a successful man.

16:39.198 --> 16:41.242
You have an opportunity
for real growth here.

16:41.492 --> 16:44.162
Not by trying to impress these people,
but by realizing that

16:45.371 --> 16:46.831
they don't matter anymore.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.710
Okay, I'm ready.

16:51.169 --> 16:53.463
Oh, Roz.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.590
You look beautiful.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.550
- Well, thank you.
- But we're not going.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.802
- What?
- Well, I'm sorry, Roz.

17:00.052 --> 17:02.013
It's got something to do
with my personal growth.

17:02.221 --> 17:03.931
I don't care
about these people anymore,

17:04.140 --> 17:05.599
and, you know,
I want them to know it.

17:05.808 --> 17:08.685
Frasier, I hired a babysitter twice.

17:08.935 --> 17:10.938
I did my makeup twice.

17:11.189 --> 17:15.318
I performed a miracle of engineering
by taping myself into this dress twice,

17:15.526 --> 17:17.069
only to be stood up twice?

17:17.319 --> 17:18.863
Technically,
you did your hair once.

17:19.113 --> 17:20.114
Shut up!

17:20.323 --> 17:21.324
You know, someday,

17:21.531 --> 17:23.409
you're gonna need
another favour from me, buddy.

17:23.617 --> 17:26.287
And when that day comes, I hope
you know what you can do with it.

17:26.494 --> 17:29.165
- I have a pretty good idea.
- Well, do it twice!

17:31.167 --> 17:34.462
- Well, that was something.
- Please, you call that a tantrum?

17:34.670 --> 17:37.006
Maris used to do that once a week.

17:37.214 --> 17:40.050
Poor thing needed help
slamming the door.

17:40.509 --> 17:43.804
Frasier, I was just talking to Duke on
the phone and your agent clicked in.

17:44.054 --> 17:46.515
She was calling from a pay phone
and she couldn't really talk,

17:46.765 --> 17:49.435
but she said that KPOV wants you
to host your own show for them.

17:50.769 --> 17:54.898
My own television show?

17:55.107 --> 17:57.359
- At KPOV?
- Congratulations, Frasier.

17:57.568 --> 18:00.696
- That's wonderful.
- Thank you. Thank you all.

18:03.365 --> 18:07.202
I just realized, this is an even bigger
opportunity for personal growth.

18:07.786 --> 18:09.580
Having a prestigious new job
like this,

18:09.788 --> 18:12.916
and not even going to that reunion
to boast about it.

18:13.333 --> 18:15.836
It is a great opportunity, isn't it?

18:17.671 --> 18:19.840
- Have a good time.
- I will.

18:23.760 --> 18:27.264
Well, I must say, Frasier did have
a run of bad luck this week.

18:27.472 --> 18:29.850
I'm certainly glad
it's finally turned out better for him.

18:30.058 --> 18:33.562
No, he didn't really get a call.
I just made it all up.

18:35.230 --> 18:36.273
His agent didn't call?

18:36.481 --> 18:40.694
No, I just wanted to give the guy
something to brag about.

18:41.069 --> 18:44.197
Dad, I know you were trying to help
but don't you think that's a little risky?

18:44.406 --> 18:46.241
What if somebody
knows it's not true?

18:46.491 --> 18:48.285
Oh, no, you worry too much.
Who's gonna know?

18:48.493 --> 18:50.120
Most of these people
are from out of town.

18:50.328 --> 18:51.955
They probably never even heard
of KPOV.

18:52.122 --> 18:55.959
I knew it. When you said KPOV,
I thought it sounded familiar.

18:56.209 --> 18:58.420
And it's right here
in Dr. Crane's newsletter.

18:58.628 --> 19:02.424
His classmate Karl Degersdorff
was just named station manager.

19:05.176 --> 19:07.679
Won't that be nice for them?
They'll be working together now.

19:07.929 --> 19:08.930
Oh, my God.

19:09.139 --> 19:11.391
Come on, it's gonna be all right.
Don't worry about it.

19:11.641 --> 19:13.601
This Degersdorff probably
won't even show.

19:13.810 --> 19:16.313
You know, he just got a new job.
He's probably real busy.

19:17.188 --> 19:19.691
I guess you're right.
We mustn't assume the worst.

19:19.899 --> 19:22.402
I'm acting like Frasier,
as if there was really a curse.

19:22.652 --> 19:27.073
Look here. He's also serving
as this year's reunion coordinator.

19:40.044 --> 19:42.630
Good evening. Hello.

19:42.881 --> 19:44.674
Good to see you again.

19:45.675 --> 19:47.969
Hi, how you been?

19:52.348 --> 19:54.892
- Hi, fellas.
- Hi.

20:01.524 --> 20:02.984
Hit it.

20:04.694 --> 20:06.571
<i>- Hello
- Hello</i>

20:06.779 --> 20:08.406
<i>Hello</i>

20:08.656 --> 20:10.867
<i>Hello</i>

20:11.117 --> 20:14.662
<i>Goodbye my Coney Island baby</i>

20:14.871 --> 20:17.123
<i>Farewell my own true love</i>

20:17.373 --> 20:18.416
<i>True love, oh, honey</i>

20:18.624 --> 20:22.169
<i>I'm goin' to go away and leave you</i>

20:22.378 --> 20:24.213
<i>Never to see you any</i>

20:24.463 --> 20:25.840
<i>Never gonna see you any</i>

20:26.048 --> 20:30.344
<i>I'm gonna sail upon that ferry boat</i>
