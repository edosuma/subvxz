WEBVTT

00:12.412 --> 00:14.080
And so we have reached
the final week of the season

00:14.280 --> 00:15.849
before the playoffs.

00:15.882 --> 00:18.218
Somehow, Kevin and
Jenny are already

00:18.251 --> 00:20.887
in, leaving two
spots to be decided

00:21.087 --> 00:22.923
by these last two games.

00:22.956 --> 00:24.190
I thought the season was over.

00:24.224 --> 00:25.692
In one game, we've
got Pete and Taco‐‐

00:25.792 --> 00:27.694
I think we all know how
that one's going to end.

00:27.728 --> 00:28.729
You can see into the future?

00:28.762 --> 00:30.263
Victory all but certain.

00:30.296 --> 00:32.733
And then the other game,
we've got the league champion,

00:32.766 --> 00:35.435
the people's champion, moi‐‐

00:35.468 --> 00:36.603
Really?

00:36.637 --> 00:40.473
‐‐versus Andre, otherwise
known as the James‐‐

00:40.507 --> 00:41.642
Bondres.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.109
A double O winner.

00:43.143 --> 00:46.880
Andre, I am going to
savage you this week.

00:47.147 --> 00:50.984
I am going to take each one
of your pre‐existing holes

00:51.151 --> 00:52.953
and fill it with my seed.

00:52.986 --> 00:54.087
I wanna see!
I wanna see!

00:54.120 --> 00:55.055
Oh, no, no, no, honey.

00:55.088 --> 00:56.657
Daddy's doing adult talk.

00:56.690 --> 01:00.126
And then invite my infant son
in to go potty inside of you,

01:00.160 --> 01:02.195
like you're a rest
stop bathroom.

01:02.228 --> 01:03.029
‐ Blimey.
‐ No.

01:03.229 --> 01:04.364
That's disgusting.

01:04.464 --> 01:05.365
RUXIN: Nobody will hear
your screams of agony.

01:05.532 --> 01:06.933
Are you guys hearing this?

01:07.167 --> 01:10.203
Andre, I'm going to take my
hand, stick it inside of you,

01:10.270 --> 01:14.808
and then open it like a
baseball mitt, and then‐‐

01:14.841 --> 01:16.577
So you know why
you're here in HR?

01:16.577 --> 01:17.544
Getting a raise?

01:17.678 --> 01:19.445
You are not allowed
to use company

01:19.479 --> 01:23.083
email or software to deliver
your personal, disgusting

01:23.116 --> 01:24.417
messages.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.953
This was actually just
rehearsing my closing

01:27.120 --> 01:28.421
arguments for an upcoming case.

01:28.454 --> 01:31.658
Where in the court of
law do you use the phrase‐‐

01:31.692 --> 01:32.759
I wanna get this right‐‐

01:32.793 --> 01:33.827
balls deep?

01:33.827 --> 01:35.696
Well, if you must
know, Mr. Swall,

01:35.729 --> 01:38.532
we're representing a children's
playground consortium.

01:38.565 --> 01:40.701
A number of children
drowned in a ball pit.

01:40.734 --> 01:44.170
We're wondering how
deep is balls deep.

01:44.204 --> 01:46.773
They were up to
their mouth in balls?

01:46.807 --> 01:47.674
Yes.

01:47.674 --> 01:48.809
They were balls deep.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.343
Really?

01:50.410 --> 01:53.479
I'm going to take a razor
blade and slice from your taint

01:53.514 --> 01:58.519
to your ball sack, and then
open it up like a taco‐‐

01:58.552 --> 01:59.786
Disgusting.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.855
Years from now, they're
going to think that's poetry.

02:01.888 --> 02:05.091
[theme music]

02:05.225 --> 02:06.492
RUXIN: Because of
that HR asshole,

02:06.527 --> 02:09.195
I have no computer access
to league activities,

02:09.295 --> 02:11.765
so I'm using my old
personal email address.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.967
Herdsman@EarthLink.net?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.001
No.

02:15.035 --> 02:16.603
YaYa@yahoo.com?

02:16.703 --> 02:20.907
If you must know, it's
TheRuxster18@hotmail.com.

02:20.907 --> 02:22.242
[laughs]
‐ Yes!

02:22.275 --> 02:23.376
I can't tell what's funnier.

02:23.510 --> 02:25.411
Is it that you
chose The Ruxster,

02:25.478 --> 02:27.247
or is it that you have an
actual Hotmail account?

02:27.280 --> 02:29.916
The official email of
foreigners and poor people?

02:29.916 --> 02:32.185
Ah, cheerio there, mates!

02:32.218 --> 02:33.987
It's your good old mate, Andre.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.355
How are you?

02:35.388 --> 02:35.989
Wow.

02:36.022 --> 02:37.323
Oh my God.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.259
Did we just win the lottery?

02:39.292 --> 02:41.361
You know, I just spent
some time across the pond.

02:41.494 --> 02:42.996
You were at a calf
implant conference

02:43.163 --> 02:44.531
in London for three days.

02:44.598 --> 02:47.534
Say what you will, but it
works very good with the birds.

02:47.568 --> 02:48.669
Danielle!

02:48.769 --> 02:50.737
Wow, you really
out‐kicked your cover.

02:50.737 --> 02:52.305
Yeah, you're telling me.

02:52.372 --> 02:54.608
She should get her body and
shirt at Lloyd's of London.

02:54.641 --> 02:55.976
‐ Can you please not do that?
‐ Hi!

02:56.009 --> 02:56.877
Hi, how are you?

02:56.910 --> 02:57.744
Good to see you.

02:57.744 --> 02:58.712
So good to see you.

02:58.712 --> 02:59.813
‐ This is Kevin.
‐ Hi.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.014
Hi.
Danielle.

03:01.047 --> 03:02.182
‐ How are you?
‐ So nice to meet you.

03:02.315 --> 03:03.216
This is the Legend
of Bagger Vance.

03:03.249 --> 03:04.785
Ah, good day, my lady.

03:04.818 --> 03:05.619
Hi.

03:05.652 --> 03:07.287
You must be Andre.

03:07.487 --> 03:09.389
This is The Ruxster 18.

03:09.422 --> 03:11.057
He can be found at Hotmail.com.

03:11.291 --> 03:12.593
Wow.

03:12.659 --> 03:14.961
When I fire up my Mac classic,
I will send you an email.

03:14.961 --> 03:16.062
Boop, boop, boop, boop.

03:16.262 --> 03:18.164
Cheerio.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.499
Totally weird.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.068
And speaking of weird,
I got a text from you

03:22.235 --> 03:24.137
that I need an explanation for.

03:24.170 --> 03:26.306
Said I cannot wait
to kill you later.

03:26.507 --> 03:27.207
That is terrible.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.542
That is an auto correct.

03:28.642 --> 03:31.845
That's supposed to say
I wanted to kiss you.

03:31.878 --> 03:32.846
Aww!

03:32.879 --> 03:33.847
You guys!

03:33.847 --> 03:34.848
No smooch for the bird.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.316
That is so cute!

03:36.382 --> 03:38.151
And actually, that would
explain why you texted me asking

03:38.318 --> 03:40.320
how I felt about Alan six.

03:40.420 --> 03:41.387
Now that makes sense.
PETE: No, no.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.723
That‐‐ that was a joke.

03:42.723 --> 03:43.624
I was kidding about that.

03:43.657 --> 03:44.991
Wow.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.260
A little early for the Alan
conversation, wouldn't you say?

03:47.360 --> 03:49.062
You usually don't
propose that til a bottle

03:49.262 --> 03:50.296
of wine and a warm bath.

03:50.463 --> 03:51.732
A little bit of Coldplay.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.466
I don't think it's for
me, but like, I can get

03:53.567 --> 03:55.569
you a beautiful strand of
Alan beads for Christmas

03:55.602 --> 03:56.202
if you'd like.

03:56.402 --> 03:57.638
Oh, don't start.

03:57.638 --> 03:58.839
Nicely done.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.073
I like it.

04:00.106 --> 04:01.508
I'm so glad Ellie's
loving gymnastics.

04:01.542 --> 04:04.210
Who's the little girl she's
hanging out with there?

04:04.444 --> 04:05.746
That's Chloe.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.013
Oh.
Chloe.

04:07.013 --> 04:07.848
BFF of the week.

04:07.881 --> 04:08.749
Mm hmm.

04:08.782 --> 04:09.750
I spoke to her parents.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.818
We've arranged a
sleepover for Friday.

04:11.852 --> 04:12.753
Oh.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.354
A sleepover is a big move.

04:14.555 --> 04:15.188
It is, it's huge.

04:15.221 --> 04:16.957
Oh my God.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.391
Are those her parents?

04:18.525 --> 04:20.193
I just spoke to
them on the phone.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.427
I know Chloe's father.

04:21.562 --> 04:22.896
I prosecuted him a
couple of years ago.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.931
I put him in jail for two years!

04:24.965 --> 04:25.932
‐ What?
‐ Oh, God.

04:25.932 --> 04:26.733
He's coming over.

04:26.733 --> 04:27.534
They're coming over!

04:27.701 --> 04:28.535
They're coming over here!

04:28.702 --> 04:30.203
Just be cool, just be cool!

04:30.236 --> 04:31.672
Hey!

04:31.705 --> 04:34.174
This is Chloe.

04:34.207 --> 04:36.476
Hello.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.712
Sweetheart, do you want to go
grab your shoes and your bag?

04:38.745 --> 04:39.613
OK, Mommy.

04:39.613 --> 04:40.814
[inaudible]

04:40.847 --> 04:42.549
Honey, why don't you go
help Chloe with her shoes?

04:42.583 --> 04:43.449
OK?

04:43.483 --> 04:44.084
Hi.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.151
Hi, Jenny.

04:45.385 --> 04:45.986
Gavin.

04:46.019 --> 04:46.920
So nice to meet you.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.288
So nice to meet you too.

04:48.488 --> 04:49.489
Hi, I'm Kevin.

04:49.623 --> 04:50.857
It's also nice.
‐ Yeah, no.

04:50.891 --> 04:51.491
I know.

04:51.525 --> 04:52.926
I know who you are.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.360
You don't remember me?

04:54.394 --> 04:55.228
Jamba Juice?

04:55.261 --> 04:56.797
No.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.331
You got me sent
away for two years,

04:58.498 --> 05:02.636
on assault. How about that, huh?

05:02.669 --> 05:04.137
Small world.

05:04.170 --> 05:05.138
Gavin.

05:05.371 --> 05:06.573
Yes.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.041
But hey, don't worry
about it though.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.610
Look, I did my time.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.243
OK.

05:10.276 --> 05:12.378
I am a family man.

05:12.412 --> 05:13.680
Beautiful family.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.281
Likewise.

05:15.415 --> 05:16.482
How did time go?
How was your‐‐

05:16.617 --> 05:18.018
‐ Please stop.
‐ How did the time go?

05:18.051 --> 05:21.722
Oh, it was uh, kind of rapey.

05:21.722 --> 05:22.823
‐ Oh.
‐ Oh.

05:22.856 --> 05:23.790
Yeah.

05:23.824 --> 05:24.925
Were you the
raper or the rapee?

05:24.925 --> 05:25.892
‐ Kevin.
‐ Did you get‐‐

05:25.926 --> 05:26.860
No.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.795
I was the rapee, actually.

05:28.829 --> 05:29.830
JENNY: That's horrible.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.231
How were the pickup
basketball games?

05:31.264 --> 05:32.165
Because I've heard they're‐‐

05:32.398 --> 05:32.999
Violent.

05:35.736 --> 05:38.972
Well, Ellie is super
excited to have Chloe over.

05:38.972 --> 05:39.806
Oh my God, yeah.

05:39.806 --> 05:41.041
No, I'm so excited.

05:41.041 --> 05:41.942
So great meeting you.

05:41.942 --> 05:42.776
You too.

05:42.776 --> 05:43.810
Have a great night.

05:43.810 --> 05:46.680
Great seeing you!

05:46.680 --> 05:47.814
That was‐‐

05:47.848 --> 05:48.682
That went poorly.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.256
So this sleepover
is really happening

05:56.422 --> 05:57.758
with this ex‐con's kid.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.560
He did his crime, he did
his time, you did your job,

05:59.593 --> 06:00.594
there's nothing wrong with that.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.929
And that would
be fine, if that

06:02.929 --> 06:04.464
was all of the information.

06:04.665 --> 06:05.566
What did you do?

06:05.699 --> 06:07.367
All right, this
is what happened.

06:07.467 --> 06:09.435
We're in the courthouse,
he's being processed.

06:09.469 --> 06:10.571
I'm just hoping
I don't get Judge

06:10.737 --> 06:12.005
Lambert, because she could be‐‐

06:12.005 --> 06:13.306
[text alert]

06:13.339 --> 06:14.440
KEVIN (VOICEOVER): As
he's being led away,

06:14.608 --> 06:16.910
I get a text message from Jenny.

06:16.943 --> 06:18.244
[laughs]

06:18.278 --> 06:21.848
KEVIN (VOICEOVER): IT said a
pen just exploded in my vag.

06:21.882 --> 06:26.086
And then I realized she meant
bag, and it auto corrected.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.053
[laughs]

06:27.087 --> 06:28.354
What?

06:28.388 --> 06:29.690
KEVIN (VOICEOVER): So
now Gavin looks at me,

06:29.723 --> 06:31.257
and the last image he
sees before he heads

06:31.424 --> 06:32.325
off to jail for two years‐‐

06:32.358 --> 06:33.527
What's wrong with you?

06:33.660 --> 06:34.427
KEVIN (VOICEOVER):
‐‐is me laughing.

06:34.595 --> 06:35.896
Oh, no, no, no, no!

06:35.896 --> 06:36.730
PETE: This is bad.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.064
That's like Cape Fear shit.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.499
That's why you've
just confirmed

06:39.533 --> 06:40.867
my decision to get this.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.103
Jesus, what the hell
are you doing with‐‐

06:43.136 --> 06:44.304
don't twirl it!

06:44.470 --> 06:45.271
Where did you get a gun?

06:45.438 --> 06:46.607
I'm a district attorney.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.374
I got a carrier's
permit, if you must know.

06:48.509 --> 06:49.743
So that you can
placcidentally shoot

06:49.910 --> 06:50.977
yourself in your own house?

06:51.111 --> 06:52.112
You don't even know
what you're doing!

06:52.145 --> 06:53.246
I know exactly‐‐

06:53.279 --> 06:54.180
oh, shoot.

06:54.214 --> 06:54.981
OK.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.182
Is that a gun?

06:56.182 --> 06:57.383
Toss it here!

06:57.551 --> 06:58.585
Taco, this is not a joke!

06:58.785 --> 07:00.020
That is awesome.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.487
We need to get drunk and
go to the firing range, AKA

07:01.622 --> 07:02.789
the field next to the highway.

07:02.823 --> 07:03.924
No!

07:04.024 --> 07:05.659
You're doing it wrong,
you're doing it wrong.

07:05.726 --> 07:08.494
Look, it goes in this way, like
this, and then you fire it.

07:08.529 --> 07:09.930
‐ What?
‐ Woah!

07:09.963 --> 07:10.964
Jesus, man!

07:11.031 --> 07:11.765
What?

07:11.932 --> 07:12.933
I assumed it wasn't loaded!

07:13.066 --> 07:14.200
OK, I'm just
going to take this,

07:14.234 --> 07:15.669
and we're going to put it down.

07:15.702 --> 07:17.303
By the way, where's the
vuvuzela I kept in the attic?

07:17.337 --> 07:18.471
We threw it away.

07:18.505 --> 07:19.239
The thing was
getting disgusting.

07:19.472 --> 07:20.106
What?

07:20.106 --> 07:21.074
That was my guest bong!

07:21.074 --> 07:22.075
Wait, what is a guest bong?

07:22.108 --> 07:23.744
Were you raised by wolves?

07:23.777 --> 07:26.513
A guest bong is a bong you
leave at someone else's house

07:26.547 --> 07:27.714
so while you're
visiting them, you

07:27.748 --> 07:29.583
can sneak away and get high.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.018
You basically leave little
bongs at all your friends'

07:32.018 --> 07:32.886
houses around the city?

07:32.919 --> 07:33.987
Yes.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.388
For instance, the guest
bong at your place

07:35.522 --> 07:36.890
is the pepper shaker.
‐ That's good.

07:36.890 --> 07:37.991
I never use that.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.660
How am I supposed to
get high while I'm here?

07:39.726 --> 07:41.227
How about just coming
over and spending some time

07:41.261 --> 07:42.495
with your family, sober?

07:42.529 --> 07:43.764
You expect me to
sit through your mind

07:43.797 --> 07:45.365
numbing dinner anecdotes sober?

07:45.465 --> 07:46.800
Or babysit your little
rug rat whose got

07:46.933 --> 07:48.068
a second grade reading level?

07:48.101 --> 07:50.871
That's because she's
in the second grade.

07:50.904 --> 07:55.809
Dear Andre, I'm going to
go so balls deep in your team

07:55.909 --> 07:57.511
this week that you're
going to be able to see

07:57.544 --> 08:00.413
my sac inside of your stomach.

08:00.647 --> 08:01.882
Oh, gross.

08:01.948 --> 08:02.849
Ugh.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.818
No amount of
vaginal rejuvenation

08:04.851 --> 08:07.087
will fix your team's
vagina, Andre.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.254
No.

08:08.254 --> 08:11.858
Physician, vaginally
rejuvenate thyself.

08:11.858 --> 08:12.492
Come on, Andre.

08:12.526 --> 08:13.694
No response?

08:13.827 --> 08:15.696
He's just getting
savaged by Ruxin.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.131
Who's Andrea Klotkin?

08:18.131 --> 08:18.999
I don't know.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.967
Oh, who are you people?

08:21.001 --> 08:24.871
Why you sending me these
disgusting messages?

08:25.005 --> 08:27.608
Hey Andre, when
Ruspin's done with you,

08:27.774 --> 08:31.177
it's going to look like this.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.546
‐ Oh!
‐ Oh!

08:32.579 --> 08:33.413
Oh, God!

08:33.680 --> 08:34.280
Ahh!

08:34.280 --> 08:35.415
Oh, God, Taco!

08:35.448 --> 08:36.583
Get out of our attic!

08:36.617 --> 08:37.651
I like it here.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.485
There's internet and heat.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.655
ANDRE: You sent that
email to my cleaning lady!

08:41.755 --> 08:43.456
Look, it's not my
fault. Hotmail auto

08:43.624 --> 08:45.058
corrected Andre for Andrea.

08:45.158 --> 08:47.561
Why do you have his
housekeeper's email?

08:47.594 --> 08:49.062
Because he wanted
me to use her,

08:49.162 --> 08:50.664
and I'm not going to
let her in my house

08:50.831 --> 08:51.832
and let him snoop around.

08:51.865 --> 08:52.498
Right.

08:52.533 --> 08:53.767
Collusion.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.602
Be that as it may,
what we need to do here

08:55.769 --> 08:57.170
is start a brand new chain, OK?

08:57.170 --> 08:58.138
No more replying all.

08:58.171 --> 08:58.939
That's it.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.073
OK!

09:00.106 --> 09:01.441
Hey, guys.

09:01.608 --> 09:02.442
Oh, where are you moving to?

09:02.643 --> 09:03.977
Not moving.

09:04.010 --> 09:05.211
You guys were cleaning, so I
got in the cleaning spirit.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.279
And?

09:06.279 --> 09:07.548
I'm going to put
it in the attic.

09:07.581 --> 09:08.815
‐ No.
‐ We just cleaned out our attic.

09:08.915 --> 09:10.784
Exactly.
So now there's room for my shit.

09:10.817 --> 09:11.785
No.

09:11.818 --> 09:12.886
Taco!

09:12.919 --> 09:15.622
Taco, mind yourself
on the apples and pears!

09:15.656 --> 09:16.757
What is that?

09:16.923 --> 09:17.691
Cockney rhyming slang.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.292
Apples and pears, stairs.

09:19.325 --> 09:21.194
Are you trying to find new
ways for us to make fun of you?

09:21.294 --> 09:23.029
There is something to
the idea that I could

09:23.063 --> 09:24.731
use this as code
language so I could

09:24.898 --> 09:25.866
send stuff from my work email.

09:26.032 --> 09:27.300
Like how would you
say shit sipper?

09:27.300 --> 09:29.335
You're a real
old Jack Tripper.

09:29.603 --> 09:32.338
How would you say, I am going
to rip your shitty team of jack

09:32.338 --> 09:34.641
offs from poo hole to goo hole?

09:34.775 --> 09:36.176
Actually, that already rhymes.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.844
And why would you even say that?

09:38.011 --> 09:39.045
Why can't you just beat me?

09:39.179 --> 09:40.781
Why do you have to
get inside of me?

09:40.914 --> 09:42.448
Why do you have to get
inside my poo hole?

09:42.683 --> 09:43.950
OK?

09:44.017 --> 09:45.886
Next time you want to stick
something in me, text me.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.220
But what if we
want to say we want

09:47.220 --> 09:48.955
to cram it down your throat?

09:48.955 --> 09:50.490
Then DM me.

09:50.524 --> 09:51.758
Good day.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.493
What, are you going
back to your old job

09:53.594 --> 09:55.562
as a caretaker at a
downtrodden estate?

09:55.796 --> 09:56.963
Luck you.

09:56.997 --> 09:57.564
Oh.

09:57.598 --> 09:58.398
Woah.

09:58.632 --> 09:59.700
Move, you git.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.201
Why is Andre talking
about his poo hole?

10:01.234 --> 10:02.268
Jesus, Cheech and Chong.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.169
What‐‐

10:03.169 --> 10:04.705
Did you just get high?

10:04.738 --> 10:05.839
I'll give you a hint.

10:05.872 --> 10:06.907
Yes.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.108
So I guess you found
a new guest bong?

10:08.141 --> 10:09.242
No, it's a guest pipe.

10:09.242 --> 10:10.476
Are you baked all the time?

10:10.677 --> 10:12.078
Oh, not this baked.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.981
I just wish I could walk around
in a cloud of it all day long.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.683
To the cloud, like Microsoft.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.051
All right, you
realize that that's just

10:18.084 --> 10:20.587
a cloud of data pushing
itself wirelessly

10:20.754 --> 10:22.388
through different devices?

10:22.388 --> 10:24.891
Now who sounds baked?

10:24.958 --> 10:27.628
I forgot to tell you how
much I loved your friends.

10:27.828 --> 10:28.629
Oh, wow.

10:28.662 --> 10:29.495
Well, that makes one of us.

10:29.696 --> 10:30.396
I really like them.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.397
I think they're awesome.

10:31.431 --> 10:32.365
Well, that is good.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.300
Because you got rave reviews.

10:34.334 --> 10:35.869
Thank you.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.337
Anyway, I'm going to put my
computer away and not be rude

10:37.370 --> 10:38.171
so we can have our date.

10:38.204 --> 10:39.205
No, no, no, no, no.

10:39.239 --> 10:40.741
What is that?

10:40.774 --> 10:42.175
Um, this is my
fantasy football team,

10:42.275 --> 10:44.811
and I was in the process
of setting my lineup.

10:44.911 --> 10:47.213
OK, well let's‐‐
let's set your lineup.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.248
What?

10:48.248 --> 10:49.315
Yeah, let's set your lineup.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.617
Let's do this.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.886
Like, I normally
do this by myself.

10:53.019 --> 10:54.487
Well, when you
were a single person,

10:54.521 --> 10:57.123
there were a lot of things
that you had to do by yourself.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.893
But now that I'm here,
we can do them together.

10:59.926 --> 11:02.262
And I'm guessing
that's an improvement?

11:02.262 --> 11:03.597
All right.

11:03.630 --> 11:04.698
In all fairness, I am
playing Taco this week.

11:04.898 --> 11:05.899
OK, great.

11:05.932 --> 11:08.001
Woah, you just
grabbed the computer.

11:08.001 --> 11:08.602
OK, hold on.

11:08.835 --> 11:09.736
Oh, quiet.

11:09.770 --> 11:10.937
This is like
fifth base for me.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.305
This is like the
equivalent of male Alan.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.106
What?

11:13.139 --> 11:14.107
Michael Vick?

11:14.240 --> 11:16.342
Is OJ Simpson on
your lineup as well?

11:16.376 --> 11:17.377
He's retired.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.345
Michael Vick has done his time.

11:19.379 --> 11:20.346
No, no, no.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.948
We're not playing Michael Vick.

11:22.015 --> 11:25.786
He may have worked on your
team, but he is not on our team.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.020
‐ OK.
‐ OK?

11:27.053 --> 11:28.021
All right.

11:28.054 --> 11:29.322
What other QBs do you have?
‐ Uh‐‐

11:29.355 --> 11:30.290
You must have another one.

11:30.290 --> 11:31.391
B. Roethlisberger.

11:31.424 --> 11:32.492
His name is Ben
Roethlisberger.

11:32.526 --> 11:33.627
Ben Roethlisberger.

11:33.660 --> 11:37.197
Has he ever done anything wrong?

11:37.230 --> 11:38.031
Never.

11:38.064 --> 11:38.665
Perfect.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.066
He is a good man.

11:40.166 --> 11:42.235
Welcome to the lineup,
Ben Roethlisberger.

11:42.268 --> 11:43.369
Take a look.

11:43.403 --> 11:44.270
Submit.

11:44.270 --> 11:45.539
Our lineup has been sent!

11:45.772 --> 11:46.372
Wow.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.774
That's huge!

11:47.874 --> 11:49.142
I literally feel like
I've just been deflowered.

11:49.275 --> 11:50.877
Well, you'll cry
the first time,

11:50.911 --> 11:52.478
but every time after that,
it'll be a little less painful.

11:52.713 --> 11:53.614
Come here.

11:53.647 --> 11:55.982
All right, all
right, all right!

11:59.019 --> 12:00.220
ANDRE: Andrea,
please don't quit!

12:00.320 --> 12:01.988
Your friends are disgusting.
You're disgusting.

12:02.022 --> 12:03.056
I know.

12:03.089 --> 12:04.591
Don't judge me on the
basis of my friends.

12:04.791 --> 12:05.559
I'll do anything.

12:05.592 --> 12:06.827
I swear this will stop.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.061
Come on, love!

12:08.094 --> 12:10.096
You work less hours,
you get more pay.

12:10.196 --> 12:13.466
You really got me over
this Christmas Carol.

12:13.499 --> 12:14.868
Christmas Carol?

12:15.068 --> 12:16.002
You like Dickens?

12:16.036 --> 12:16.837
Oh, no.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.672
It was a Cockney rhyming slang.

12:18.705 --> 12:19.673
Barrel.

12:19.706 --> 12:21.241
Christmas Carol.

12:21.307 --> 12:23.810
You know, I am going to be in
community theater production.

12:23.977 --> 12:24.611
I play Mrs. Cratchit.

12:24.811 --> 12:25.646
That's great!

12:25.679 --> 12:27.581
You come Monday night, no?

12:27.614 --> 12:28.481
This Monday?

12:28.515 --> 12:29.783
Mm hmm.

12:29.816 --> 12:30.884
This Monday is rough,
because football.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.353
But I would love to come.

12:33.386 --> 12:36.456
I would love to come see you
in your community theater

12:36.456 --> 12:38.625
production of The
Christmas Carol.

12:38.825 --> 12:39.459
I love it.

12:39.492 --> 12:40.527
OK.

12:40.527 --> 12:43.096
And I'm going
to bring a friend.

12:43.129 --> 12:44.030
Come on!

12:44.064 --> 12:44.765
Yes!

12:44.798 --> 12:45.766
My players are killing it.

12:45.799 --> 12:46.600
Lawrence Fitzgerald‐‐

12:46.633 --> 12:47.634
Larry.

12:47.668 --> 12:48.769
‐ Raymond Rice‐‐
‐ It's Ray.

12:48.969 --> 12:49.636
And Came Newtown.

12:49.670 --> 12:50.871
It's Cam Newton.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.005
You can't even
pronounce‐‐ oh, you're‐‐

12:52.138 --> 12:53.540
Brandon Jacobs gives
you a touchdown.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.374
Are you kidding me?

12:54.407 --> 12:56.242
To the cloud!

12:56.276 --> 12:58.979
Well, at least
we have next week!

12:59.012 --> 12:59.646
[groans]

12:59.680 --> 13:01.014
Always always.

13:01.047 --> 13:03.016
There's really not a
next week for my team.

13:03.049 --> 13:03.950
RUXIN: That's not true.

13:04.150 --> 13:05.318
There's the sacko.

13:05.351 --> 13:06.653
Face it, Pete.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.321
You're a ripe old boozer.

13:08.388 --> 13:09.189
What?

13:09.222 --> 13:10.090
Loser, Boozer.

13:10.123 --> 13:10.724
All right.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.058
Easy, Jason Statham.

13:12.258 --> 13:14.695
Call me The Transporter.

13:14.728 --> 13:18.398
Or call him transgender.

13:18.431 --> 13:19.766
[laughs]

13:19.800 --> 13:21.101
I'd like to offer my
services to all of you.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.403
If anyone has a load that
needs to be transported,

13:23.436 --> 13:24.905
I'm your man.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.440
Well, how many loads can
you transport at one time?

13:27.440 --> 13:28.942
As many as humanly possible.

13:29.075 --> 13:30.476
You take the whole load?
All at once?

13:30.511 --> 13:32.045
That's right.

13:32.078 --> 13:34.014
I take the load, hold it inside
me, and I don't let it out.

13:34.047 --> 13:34.648
Wow.

13:34.681 --> 13:35.716
Like big loads?

13:35.916 --> 13:36.650
I love big loads.

13:36.883 --> 13:37.551
Wow.

13:37.584 --> 13:38.552
You take a lady's load?

13:38.585 --> 13:39.886
I'd take a lady's load.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.154
But I prefer a man's load.

13:41.187 --> 13:41.788
Yeah.

13:42.022 --> 13:42.823
PETE: Come on!

13:42.989 --> 13:43.790
DANIELLE: How are we doing now?

13:43.990 --> 13:45.458
We're not doing great.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.627
How's, um‐‐

13:46.660 --> 13:48.094
Roethlisberger?

13:48.128 --> 13:50.030
Not doing as well as Michael
Vick did earlier today.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.264
I have to be honest.

13:51.297 --> 13:52.799
Well, at least you
have both of them.

13:52.833 --> 13:53.634
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

13:53.667 --> 13:54.467
Right?

13:54.500 --> 13:55.468
It's great.

13:55.468 --> 13:56.803
Everyone's having so much fun.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.204
Mm hmm.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.973
Because I'm in the
playoffs, and I think that‐‐

14:00.006 --> 14:01.307
Wait, are you in the playoffs?

14:01.341 --> 14:02.776
I think I just said
I was in the playoffs.

14:02.976 --> 14:03.944
I'm in the playoffs!

14:04.077 --> 14:05.245
DANIELLE: Wait a
minute, this is so cute.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.547
Did you guys just figure
this out right now?

14:06.547 --> 14:07.748
No, this is
called shit talking.

14:07.881 --> 14:08.682
And you will catch
on very quickly.

14:08.715 --> 14:09.983
OK.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.151
And then the Monday
night game will decide

14:11.184 --> 14:13.086
which one of these
morons is going

14:13.253 --> 14:14.988
to lose to me in the playoffs.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.523
Look, there's still
some time, all right?

14:16.523 --> 14:17.390
It's not over yet.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.391
Oh, no, no, no, no!

14:18.391 --> 14:19.860
You got passworded as Taco.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.194
I'll get you a beer.
How about that?

14:21.227 --> 14:22.529
That sounds great.
I'll take a‐‐

14:22.563 --> 14:23.363
Oh, no.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.230
No, no, no.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.465
I got it.

14:25.465 --> 14:26.633
‐ OK, you pick.
‐ Anyone else?

14:26.667 --> 14:27.433
I'll be right back.

14:27.467 --> 14:28.535
Thank you.

14:28.569 --> 14:29.970
ANDRE: Get him a tankard of ale.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.872
Watch, she's going to
pick me some like skunked

14:32.005 --> 14:33.507
out Milwaukee's Best
Light, and leave

14:33.507 --> 14:35.308
the Stella Artois on my bench.

14:35.341 --> 14:37.611
KEVIN: This is your own fault.
If you let your girlfriend

14:37.878 --> 14:40.781
choose your lineup, that is
like the male version of Alan.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.482
I'm sorry, pot calling
the kettle black here?

14:42.516 --> 14:43.717
She is not a girl, Pete.

14:43.750 --> 14:44.651
Aww!
Thanks, babe.

14:44.685 --> 14:45.485
I love you.

14:45.519 --> 14:46.720
I love you too.

14:46.753 --> 14:47.888
I shouldn't have
to pay this much.

14:48.021 --> 14:48.755
The punishment
doesn't fit the crime.

14:48.955 --> 14:49.590
You know, Pete?

14:49.623 --> 14:50.490
I like her.

14:50.524 --> 14:51.592
I think she's a keeper.

14:51.592 --> 14:52.926
Like the keeper
that Michael Vick

14:53.026 --> 14:54.160
ran in for his third
touchdown of the day

14:54.194 --> 14:55.662
while he was on my bench?

14:55.929 --> 14:57.831
I want you out in front of
your flat at 6:00 PM sharp.

14:57.964 --> 14:59.199
Ugh, I don't want to
see amateur theater.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.834
It's just a bunch
of fat girls dealing

15:00.867 --> 15:02.503
with their complicated
issues with dudes

15:02.503 --> 15:03.537
who are still in the closet.

15:03.537 --> 15:05.005
Let me tell you
something, mate.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.873
You gotta make things right
between me and my lady.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.942
She's the best
chambermaid I ever had.

15:08.975 --> 15:10.644
Either come to
this play with me,

15:10.911 --> 15:14.648
or I'll bombard your work
email with pictures of Alan.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.883
All kinds of Alan.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.819
Alan reconstruction.

15:18.852 --> 15:20.153
What about photos
of Alan Rickman?

15:20.353 --> 15:21.054
Here you go, sweetie.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.589
Oh, thank you so much.

15:22.623 --> 15:23.524
Appreciate that.

15:23.557 --> 15:25.291
This should help.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.793
Do you like it?
‐ It's awesome.

15:26.993 --> 15:27.628
Thank you so much.

15:27.661 --> 15:28.461
You're welcome.

15:28.461 --> 15:29.796
I appreciate it.

15:29.830 --> 15:30.897
I appreciate you.

15:30.931 --> 15:33.233
Oh, OK, thanks.

15:33.266 --> 15:36.670
OK, who is ready
for ice cream?

15:36.670 --> 15:38.004
‐ Me!
‐ Yeah!

15:38.104 --> 15:39.673
It's going to be the
best sleepover ever!

15:39.706 --> 15:40.607
You guys ready to go?

15:40.641 --> 15:41.642
Mm hmm!

15:41.675 --> 15:44.811
Um, I left my fuzzy at home.

15:44.845 --> 15:45.679
Oh, what's your fuzzy?

15:45.712 --> 15:46.580
Yeah, it's my blanket.

15:46.580 --> 15:47.848
I need it to sleep.

15:47.881 --> 15:49.449
Chloe, no worries.

15:49.482 --> 15:50.784
We will call your parents and
just have them bring it over.

15:51.017 --> 15:51.952
‐ OK.
‐ Yeah?

15:51.985 --> 15:53.419
Oh, I forgot my
Faces of Death DVD.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.589
Can you have them stop by
my apartment and pick it up?

15:55.622 --> 15:57.157
No, Taco.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.592
Movie night's canceled, girls.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.261
Doesn't matter, because
it's a girls night!

16:01.294 --> 16:01.895
Yes!

16:02.128 --> 16:03.363
Let's go!

16:03.396 --> 16:04.831
If you don't finish your
ice cream, bring it back.

16:04.865 --> 16:05.632
‐ No.
‐ No.

16:05.699 --> 16:07.200
Aw!

16:07.267 --> 16:11.905
I'll drink to Mr. Scrooge for
your sake, and for this day.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.607
I can't believe I'm
here watching this instead

16:13.640 --> 16:14.941
of Monday Night Football.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.910
Yeah, because I really
want to be here watching

16:16.943 --> 16:18.478
a shitty production
of The Christmas Carol

16:18.512 --> 16:20.280
instead of watching
a game that dictates

16:20.313 --> 16:23.149
whether or not I go back to the
sacko or get into the playoffs.

16:23.349 --> 16:25.519
Long life to him!

16:25.619 --> 16:28.522
And a Merry Christmas
and a Happy New Year.

16:28.555 --> 16:31.457
You know, if I win tonight,
the year of the sacko's over.

16:31.491 --> 16:36.563
Ghost of sacko past,
ghost of sacko future.

16:36.563 --> 16:37.631
How much time's left?

16:37.631 --> 16:39.199
You're not going to do it.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.433
All I needed was ten points,
I'm getting eight points.

16:40.466 --> 16:41.001
Yes!
I won!

16:41.034 --> 16:42.803
No, no, I lost!

16:42.836 --> 16:45.539
James Bondres are
the playoffs, baby.

16:45.539 --> 16:47.774
License to win.

16:48.008 --> 16:48.909
Hallelujah.

16:49.075 --> 16:50.877
God bless us all, everyone!

16:50.911 --> 16:52.445
God damn you!

16:52.513 --> 16:57.851
God damn you no talent
ass‐eating shit‐sipping hacks!

16:57.884 --> 16:59.085
Excuse me?

16:59.119 --> 17:01.822
That is my son!

17:01.855 --> 17:02.689
Rodney?

17:02.723 --> 17:03.990
Swall?

17:04.190 --> 17:04.958
See you Wednesday?

17:05.158 --> 17:06.760
What do you think?

17:07.027 --> 17:09.930
This was supposed to be a
Christmas joy for everyone.

17:09.963 --> 17:12.098
But instead, you
killed Christmas.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.234
No, your son's acting
killed Christmas.

17:19.906 --> 17:20.707
Jenny?

17:24.110 --> 17:27.080
Oh, the house to myself.

17:27.113 --> 17:28.849
GAVIN: No, I'm‐‐ I'm
getting here right now.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.884
I just am pulling up.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.052
OK, so you're sure?

17:32.185 --> 17:34.054
Jenny said just
bring the fuzzy in?

17:34.087 --> 17:35.856
Door's open?

17:36.122 --> 17:36.790
OK.

17:36.823 --> 17:37.824
I love you.

17:38.058 --> 17:40.493
OK, bye.

17:40.527 --> 17:44.264
I should probably text
them that I'm outside.

17:44.430 --> 17:47.467
Coming in with Chloe's fuzzy.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.303
[text alert]

17:50.336 --> 17:51.004
Gavin?

17:51.271 --> 17:52.038
What?

17:52.205 --> 17:56.810
Oh, coming in with chloroform?

17:56.843 --> 17:58.378
What?

17:58.411 --> 18:00.847
Oh, um.

18:00.881 --> 18:02.415
Oh no.

18:06.152 --> 18:06.753
Hello?

18:10.356 --> 18:11.692
Hello?

18:11.725 --> 18:13.694
Where is everybody?

18:13.727 --> 18:15.161
Got a little something here.

18:18.298 --> 18:19.566
Anybody home?

18:19.600 --> 18:20.934
Hello?

18:20.967 --> 18:22.302
Hey, asshole!

18:22.335 --> 18:23.837
I have a gun, and
I'm gonna murder you!

18:23.870 --> 18:26.740
[screaming]

18:26.773 --> 18:27.741
Oh, God!

18:27.741 --> 18:31.144
[inaudible] Gun, gun, gun, gun!

18:34.147 --> 18:34.881
Where's my gun?

18:41.822 --> 18:42.623
Oh yeah.

18:48.862 --> 18:50.063
Oh!

18:50.296 --> 18:51.665
To the cloud!

18:51.698 --> 18:52.566
Woo!

18:52.599 --> 18:53.399
Woohoo!

18:53.433 --> 18:57.170
Tickle feet, and rub my belly!

18:57.337 --> 18:58.438
911, what's your emergency?

18:58.471 --> 18:59.773
Hello, yes.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.041
This is Kevin MacArthur, and
there's someone in my house

19:01.074 --> 19:02.175
who's here to murder me.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.243
Describe to me
what's happening.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.911
I am in my panic room.

19:05.145 --> 19:06.046
Panic room?

19:06.212 --> 19:07.548
Which really
isn't a panic room

19:07.614 --> 19:08.849
yet because it's more of a
space underneath the stairs.

19:08.849 --> 19:10.016
Please send out
dispatch right away!

19:10.050 --> 19:11.317
Is he an intruder?

19:11.351 --> 19:13.153
A few years ago, I
put a man away in jail.

19:13.186 --> 19:14.387
And while he was
being processed,

19:14.487 --> 19:15.989
I was in the court
room, and I received

19:16.222 --> 19:19.092
a text message from my wife, who
said a pen exploded in her vag.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.193
But she really meant bag!

19:20.360 --> 19:21.427
Is your wife injured, sir?

19:21.461 --> 19:23.029
No, it didn't
explode in her vag.

19:23.196 --> 19:24.430
Nothing explodes in your vag!

19:24.464 --> 19:25.899
It was her bag.
She meant bag.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.100
It was an auto correct mistake.

19:27.133 --> 19:28.502
Sir, I need to
put you on hold.

19:28.669 --> 19:30.236
911, what's your emergency?

19:30.403 --> 19:31.938
Hi, I'm about to be murdered.

19:31.972 --> 19:33.273
Where are you located, sir?

19:33.406 --> 19:34.708
I'm at the home
of Kevin MacArthur.

19:34.708 --> 19:35.909
Kevin MacArthur, you said?

19:35.909 --> 19:37.944
Yes, I am hiding
out in his bathroom,

19:37.944 --> 19:40.113
and he is outside
there with a gun.

19:40.146 --> 19:42.015
Sir, have you had a
relationship with this man

19:42.248 --> 19:43.316
previously?

19:43.416 --> 19:44.885
Our daughters are in
gymnastics together.

19:44.918 --> 19:46.920
She is a little psychopath.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.922
Daughter's a pig,
father's a pig.

19:48.922 --> 19:50.657
I'm going to put
you on hold, sir.

19:50.791 --> 19:52.358
Mr. MacArthur,
there is a gentleman

19:52.425 --> 19:54.027
on the other line who says
you are trying to kill him.

19:54.260 --> 19:54.928
No, no, no!

19:54.928 --> 19:56.496
This is me, nobody else!

19:56.530 --> 20:00.934
Me, murder, dead, inside my
house, panic room, badge, vag.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.970
OK, sir, you have officially
abused the 911 system.

20:04.004 --> 20:04.971
I'm going to disconnect you.

20:04.971 --> 20:05.972
Please, you gotta help me!

20:05.972 --> 20:07.073
Don't hang up on me, please!

20:07.307 --> 20:07.908
Shoot.

20:12.579 --> 20:13.947
Hello?

20:13.980 --> 20:14.948
Hey.

20:14.981 --> 20:15.782
[screams]

20:15.816 --> 20:17.050
Well, hello there!

20:17.083 --> 20:18.351
Want some?

20:18.384 --> 20:20.153
No, I don't want to die!

20:20.186 --> 20:21.021
Take it.

20:21.221 --> 20:22.222
I have a family!

20:22.255 --> 20:23.524
Well then you
definitely need this.

20:23.557 --> 20:24.190
No, Kevin!

20:24.424 --> 20:25.025
Listen to me!

20:25.058 --> 20:26.159
This is not Kevin.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.327
Oh, God!

20:27.360 --> 20:28.595
I took care of Kevin.

20:28.695 --> 20:30.797
Oh, you're crazy,
your wife is stuck up,

20:30.831 --> 20:33.033
and your daughter's
terrible at gymnastics!

20:33.233 --> 20:33.867
Shut up and take it!

20:33.934 --> 20:34.768
No!

20:34.801 --> 20:35.669
Put it in your mouth!

20:35.702 --> 20:36.537
Oh, God, no!

20:36.570 --> 20:37.704
Please!

20:37.738 --> 20:41.207
Just put it in your
