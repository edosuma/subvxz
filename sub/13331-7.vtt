WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.273 --> 00:10.076
Geordie Shore is back.
(cheering)

00:10.143 --> 00:12.879
What the hell
is gonna happen this time?

00:12.946 --> 00:15.014
Geordie Tours. Where?
Across Europe.

00:15.081 --> 00:16.349
(cheering)

00:16.416 --> 00:19.552
(all) What happens on tour
stays on tour.

00:20.587 --> 00:22.522
Bring on the fucking carnage.

00:23.757 --> 00:26.626
"I want you to leave
until further notice."

00:26.693 --> 00:28.828
Hi again.
Charlotte's back.

00:28.895 --> 00:30.764
Dan's pulled himself a cougar.

00:30.830 --> 00:33.733
'I'm fucking buzzing,
haven't seen me nana in ages.'

00:33.800 --> 00:35.602
Wait, it's Dan's bird...

00:35.668 --> 00:39.406
"Start packing, cos this time
I'm gonna send you to Barcelona."

00:39.472 --> 00:40.907
Barcelona.
(laughter)

00:40.974 --> 00:43.476
I feel like I'm in a porn film.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.645
What the hell am I doing in
a tranny bar?

00:45.712 --> 00:49.416
Vicky seems to be having a mint
time without Ricci. Vicky is back.

00:49.482 --> 00:51.151
I wonder how long it'll last.

00:52.519 --> 00:55.855
Charlotte's bloody mortal,
the boys are getting with girls,

00:55.922 --> 00:57.857
we may as well be in Newcastle.

00:57.924 --> 01:00.560
(Charlotte) This is it.
I'm going to talk to Gary.

01:00.627 --> 01:04.164
I'm thinking this is another me
and Charlotte chat. I love you.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.099
She drops that bombshell.

01:06.166 --> 01:09.636
I am just another girl
who's fell in love with Gary.

01:11.404 --> 01:13.540
I should have a degree in pulling.

01:13.606 --> 01:15.809
I'm a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:15.875 --> 01:18.144
If you look up pulling,
my name's there.

01:18.211 --> 01:20.280
Never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

01:20.346 --> 01:22.182
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:22.248 --> 01:26.119
I could talk the legs off a donkey.
Got the looks, got the charm.

01:26.186 --> 01:28.822
I'm fit, flirty
and I've got double Fs.

01:28.888 --> 01:30.857
Hardest graft is doing me hair.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.126
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:39.566 --> 01:41.734
We're on a Geordie tour of Barcelona,

01:41.801 --> 01:44.971
showing stag and hens how to party
and it's mint.

01:45.972 --> 01:50.743
We've smashed Spain to pieces.
Newcastle one, Barcelona nowt.

01:53.213 --> 01:54.814
'Last night got messy.'

01:54.881 --> 01:58.251
Everyone's woke up and there's
an atmosphere in the house.

02:01.888 --> 02:03.490
What the hell is happening?

02:03.556 --> 02:07.927
Last night I told Gary I loved him.
What was I thinking?

02:07.994 --> 02:09.762
I've had a weight lifted.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.867
And I've got so much off me chest.

02:13.933 --> 02:16.436
He totally pied us.
I feel like shit.

02:19.005 --> 02:21.441
That's the last time
we have a heart to heart.

02:21.508 --> 02:23.443
His heart is dead and black.

02:23.510 --> 02:27.680
I just want Gary
to acknowledge my feelings.

02:27.747 --> 02:32.285
Gaan to the beach, get some food
and just chill out.

02:35.555 --> 02:39.392
It's our last morning in Barcelona,
so everyone's hitting the beach.

02:46.032 --> 02:49.969
I think for her to finally verbalise
what she's been feeling for so long

02:50.036 --> 02:52.605
must've come as a shock to you.

02:52.672 --> 02:56.876
I do respect Charlotte being honest
but I can't lie and say I love her.

02:56.943 --> 02:58.945
I'm gonna be honest
like she has been.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.981
It must've been nice for her
to get it off her chest

03:02.048 --> 03:05.218
but do you think
it's done her any good?

03:05.285 --> 03:08.888
Normally, when a bird drops
the L-bomb, you bin them off,

03:08.955 --> 03:10.924
but I can't do that with Charlotte.

03:10.990 --> 03:16.296
Just have a word with her.
I will. I'll keep her away.

03:16.362 --> 03:19.299
'Gaz has got the right idea
by not getting wifed-in.'

03:19.365 --> 03:23.469
Relationships in Geordie Shore are
a one-way ticket to sheer disaster.

03:27.073 --> 03:30.543
Whey! (cheering)
Thank you.

03:30.610 --> 03:33.846
I gutted to be leaving,
I've had a fucking mint time.

03:33.913 --> 03:35.748
Hasta la vista, chicas.

03:35.815 --> 03:40.253
To Barcelona.
(cheering)

03:40.320 --> 03:44.324
'We've had an amazing time,
but me head's in bits, get me home.'

03:47.694 --> 03:51.431
I wanna get back to Newcastle
and to the Geordie language.

03:59.505 --> 04:03.743
We're back in the Toon, so bring on
the banter, the booze and the gym.

04:09.549 --> 04:13.052
Before we left for Barcelona,
me and Ricci had a huge argument.

04:13.119 --> 04:16.723
He stormed out the house
and he hasn't come back.

04:16.789 --> 04:18.625
Now I don't know where I stand.

04:25.131 --> 04:28.368
I've got a mint idea
to get back on track.

04:30.570 --> 04:33.906
What, like, circuits and press-ups?
Like military training.

04:33.973 --> 04:35.508
The birds as well?
Why-aye.

04:35.575 --> 04:37.243
Girls!
Yeah?

04:37.310 --> 04:39.746
I'm not sure how
the girls are gonna take it.

04:39.812 --> 04:42.482
We should do a military boot camp.

04:42.548 --> 04:44.017
'The fuck is boot camp?'

04:44.083 --> 04:46.552
I signed up for Geordie Shore,
not the SAS.

04:58.331 --> 05:02.535
The only bicep curls they're used to
is hoying a cock in their mouth.

05:03.536 --> 05:07.707
I wanna sit there with a pasty.
May we pull over at these services?

05:07.774 --> 05:09.409
(laughter)

05:11.210 --> 05:13.913
Boot camp's gonna be
a piece of piss, cos I'm solid.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.094
'Mmm! Fast food.'

05:28.161 --> 05:31.197
It's called that
cos it makes you go faster. Duh.

05:31.264 --> 05:33.733
I know!
Don't you dare think thin.

05:33.800 --> 05:37.203
Think fat.
Hooray, you did it!

05:37.270 --> 05:40.173
...to everyone who wants us
to be skinny.

05:40.239 --> 05:42.442
(belches)

05:42.508 --> 05:43.710
Well done.

05:48.548 --> 05:49.782
Whoa.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.984
I love fitness, but I hate mud.

05:52.051 --> 05:56.322
Shit the bed, I didn't realise bald
Rambo and skinny Rocky were gonna

05:56.389 --> 05:57.824
be our instructors.

05:57.890 --> 06:00.560
(gravelly)
I'm getting cold here, come on!

06:00.626 --> 06:03.730
You what? I can't be bothered
with screaming like that.

06:03.796 --> 06:04.897
Fuck boot camp.

06:04.964 --> 06:06.365
Come on, ladies, move.

06:06.432 --> 06:09.736
I'm coming, pet.
Don't call me pet, move yourself.

06:09.802 --> 06:11.738
Why are you talking like that?

06:11.804 --> 06:15.708
I thought we were coming to military
training, not a fuckin' pirate ship.

06:15.775 --> 06:17.944
Turn your hair down, it's too bright.

06:18.010 --> 06:19.212
'Fucking hell.'

06:19.278 --> 06:23.049
Sergeant Big Balls has made my fanny
hole shrink to the size a lentil.

06:23.116 --> 06:26.452
I'm going acka with the camouflage,
nee-one's gonna spot me.

06:26.519 --> 06:27.653
Proper stashed.

06:27.720 --> 06:32.558
I don't get why James would think
going out in the cold, in the mud,

06:32.625 --> 06:35.161
getting shouted at is fun.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.996
Captain Cocksucker.
Really?

06:37.063 --> 06:38.498
Yep. Here to suck you off.

06:38.564 --> 06:39.766
Really?
Yeah.

06:39.832 --> 06:41.801
Well done. See me later.

06:41.868 --> 06:43.669
Next one.
Captain Can't Be Arsed.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.905
Really? Well, I'll sort you out.

06:45.972 --> 06:48.808
I'm thinking that this man
is sexually frustrated.

06:48.875 --> 06:51.611
Get away, move yourself.
Come on, get up there!

06:51.677 --> 06:54.413
That's it! Come on!

06:54.480 --> 06:59.085
I love a bit of army training. And
the UK's number one drill sergeant.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.653
(screams)

07:00.720 --> 07:03.756
Get yourself up, get up.
No, man!

07:03.823 --> 07:08.728
We've been there one minute
before Charlotte is on the floor.

07:08.795 --> 07:11.364
Keep it moving,
keep moving all the time.

07:14.367 --> 07:17.837
You can't go that way,
get back here you two! Run!

07:17.904 --> 07:20.540
He's chasing us
cos he wants to put it in my bum,

07:20.606 --> 07:24.343
and I don't like bumhole sex,
so I'm running as fast as I can!

07:24.410 --> 07:26.612
It's like sheepdog training
gone wrong.

07:26.679 --> 07:27.980
I'll get you in a minute!

07:28.047 --> 07:31.050
He's given up, he's probably
after someone else's anus.

07:31.117 --> 07:36.389
Good, keep the elbows in tight.
Get those knees nice and high.

07:36.455 --> 07:38.891
Military boot camp
is my idea of heaven.

07:40.526 --> 07:44.797
James thinks he's Mr Motivator.
If he wants some exercise,

07:44.864 --> 07:48.134
why doesn't he just motivate
the instructor's cock?

07:48.201 --> 07:51.571
Whip the ropes. Go! Come on.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.239
Work those ropes.
(growls)

07:53.306 --> 07:58.845
Hit that tyre, go. Let's get the pain
train, let's get the pain train.

07:58.911 --> 08:03.416
I've had me heart broken, last thing
I wanna do is break into a sweat.

08:24.971 --> 08:29.208
Vicky was able to draw a line under
her and Ricci, why can't Charlotte?

08:30.209 --> 08:32.778
Go, go, go, go!

08:32.845 --> 08:35.181
(exhales)
Flip it over! And again!

08:35.248 --> 08:39.085
'I might as well have been born in a
boot camp cos I'm modelled on Troy.'

08:39.150 --> 08:41.386
I flip tyres like I flip birds.

08:41.453 --> 08:43.688
One more.
Ugh!

08:46.359 --> 08:50.963
I challenge the instructor to a game
of tug of war cos I'm solid.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.566
Come on, show me what you got.
(grunts)

08:53.633 --> 08:56.102
That's it.
I'm about to smash him

08:56.168 --> 09:00.373
and then I slip, but if I had better
grip I would have toasted him.

09:00.439 --> 09:02.575
Show me what you got.

09:02.642 --> 09:04.677
'The instructor's rinsed Scott,

09:04.744 --> 09:08.347
cos the only thing Scott's good
at tugging is Gaz's rope.

09:08.414 --> 09:10.016
(Sophie) I hate boot camp.

09:10.082 --> 09:14.186
I've got rabbit shit all over
my foot. I need to get out.

09:14.253 --> 09:16.255
'Boot camp's been absolutely mint,

09:16.322 --> 09:19.892
and somehow me biceps feel like
they're getting even bigger.'

09:21.027 --> 09:24.063
Didn't even think that was possible.

09:24.130 --> 09:27.500
James is still flipping tyres,
and all we wanna do is get out.

09:27.566 --> 09:28.768
He's a fucking twat.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.411
(Vicky) Me and Ricci
had a huge bust up

09:38.477 --> 09:41.380
cos he's a control freak
and a bit of a tit.

09:41.447 --> 09:43.883
The longest I've not spoken for.

09:43.950 --> 09:49.055
You've dealt with it so much better.
Some things have definitely changed.

09:49.121 --> 09:51.691
Vicky's relaxed so much
since Ricci's gone.

09:51.757 --> 09:56.062
She gets changed in front of us,
I've seen her tits, her fanny flap,

09:56.128 --> 10:00.099
I've even seen her bum-hole.
Since Ricci's gone she's a nudist.

10:00.166 --> 10:04.136
I know I have to speak to him
sooner rather than later.

10:04.203 --> 10:06.238
'I can stand on me own two feet.'

10:06.305 --> 10:09.775
It's time I found me balls
and told Ricci to jog on.

10:12.144 --> 10:14.013
(phone rings)

10:14.080 --> 10:16.816
"Hello."
Hello. "Hiya."

10:21.887 --> 10:25.858
'I'm reminded that Ricci's
communication skills are basic.'

10:25.925 --> 10:29.695
It's like trying to have a sensible
conversation with a courgette.

10:34.567 --> 10:36.135
Good, thank you.

10:36.202 --> 10:38.204
'I need to speak to Ricci
in person.'

10:38.270 --> 10:41.140
If you're gonna try
and get sense out of a courgette,

10:41.207 --> 10:43.309
better that you do it face-to-face.

10:43.376 --> 10:46.612
Courgette-to-face
Face-to-courgette?

10:46.679 --> 10:49.415
(sobs)

10:53.552 --> 10:56.856
'So Vicky is bursting into the room
in tears.'

10:56.922 --> 11:00.960
They've been together so long now,
it's no wonder she's emotional.

11:01.027 --> 11:05.664
You haven't spoken in ages. This is
the first time, it's just weird.

11:05.731 --> 11:09.368
Will Vicky and Ricci stay together?
At the moment I don't know.

11:09.435 --> 11:13.239
She's not finished crying.
I felt I was gonna be sick.

11:14.273 --> 11:17.476
The final straw. I think this is it.
(sobs)

11:17.543 --> 11:19.812
Let's get another fish.

11:19.879 --> 11:22.415
The last big thing I rode
was probably Scotty T.

11:22.481 --> 11:24.050
Give her a kiss.

11:24.116 --> 11:27.019
I'm gonna have
a night out with the lads.

11:27.086 --> 11:30.656
This is no time to go home
with your bird and get breast-fed.

11:30.723 --> 11:33.292
The cougar is in the nest.

11:34.393 --> 11:36.695
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

11:39.131 --> 11:39.331
.

11:41.867 --> 11:42.068
.

11:49.008 --> 11:53.279
We've been on an amazing tour of
Barcelona. It's back to Newcastle.

11:55.481 --> 11:59.251
I've had a break, and to give Vicky
space I didn't go to Barcelona.

12:01.320 --> 12:04.924
Now back to reality, and I have
to deal with the Ricci situation.

12:04.990 --> 12:08.260
I've been saying
I've lost so much of meself

12:08.327 --> 12:10.863
I don't even know who I am now.

12:10.930 --> 12:16.202
I want to be with you, I can't
leave you alone. Who wants that?

12:16.268 --> 12:19.772
By having time apart,
I'm proving I can give her space.

12:19.839 --> 12:23.843
I don't want you to say,
"Let's go back". I don't want that.

12:23.909 --> 12:27.847
I want you to see me as
a person changed. I know that.

12:27.913 --> 12:31.917
I was expecting Ricci to bool in,
all fucking guns blazing.

12:31.984 --> 12:36.655
How can I finish Ricci when he's
saying what I always wanted to hear?

12:36.722 --> 12:41.827
The thing is I've been back to me
old self this weekend, giggling,

12:41.894 --> 12:43.629
laughing, having fun.

12:45.331 --> 12:47.299
You used to make me feel like that.

12:47.366 --> 12:50.803
It's been so nice
to let me hair down and have fun

12:50.870 --> 12:53.506
and not worry about
Ricci kicking off.

12:53.572 --> 12:56.208
I have to tell him
I can't be with him any more.

12:56.275 --> 12:59.578
We just need to be on our own.

12:59.645 --> 13:03.816
And discover, or find out,
work out...

13:03.883 --> 13:06.719
...who we are, who we used to be.

13:06.785 --> 13:12.658
Ricci is being so understanding and
this is the lad I fell in love with.

13:12.725 --> 13:15.861
(sobs)

13:15.928 --> 13:18.130
Come here, come here.

13:20.132 --> 13:24.236
I never for one second wanted
any of this to end up like this.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.972
Vicky, it needed to happen,
we need to change.

13:27.039 --> 13:31.577
It'd be bad to go back to the house
so I'm gonna stay away.

13:31.644 --> 13:36.248
I'm gonna go and let you have
tonight with the boys

13:36.315 --> 13:41.253
cos they miss you.
Huh? Well, go on then. Fuck off.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.521
Right.

13:45.925 --> 13:48.060
That was so fucking hard,

13:48.127 --> 13:51.964
but I'm worried that if we get back
together, history will repeat itself

13:52.031 --> 13:54.667
and I'll be opening myself up
to more heartache.

13:54.733 --> 13:57.069
'I can't go on feeling like this.'

14:11.750 --> 14:17.089
Hi. How did it go?
Not how you'd expect.

14:17.156 --> 14:20.626
I thought she'd come back in tears.
She must've sucked him off.

14:20.693 --> 14:24.096
Imagine him saying absolutely
everything you want to hear.

14:24.163 --> 14:26.699
"I realise my mistake,
I smother you,

14:26.765 --> 14:28.667
I've tried to control you."

14:28.734 --> 14:31.103
That doesn't sound like Ricci at all.

14:31.170 --> 14:34.740
Do you know how hard that makes
walking away from him?

14:34.807 --> 14:37.343
He's not coming back.

14:37.409 --> 14:41.647
With Ricci and Vicky right now,
I feel like this might be over.

14:41.714 --> 14:46.252
Does he means it or is he saying
things cos he thinks he should?

14:46.318 --> 14:50.089
'It does seem like Ricci's changed,
but Vicky needs to be careful.'

14:50.155 --> 14:53.225
He might have went to the same
dishonesty class as Gary.

14:53.292 --> 14:56.962
They might've sat together at the
back row, wanking each other off.

14:57.029 --> 14:58.464
Whilst being dishonest.

14:58.530 --> 15:03.736
"I have had a lot of time to think,
but this has been the biggest..."

15:03.802 --> 15:05.804
Wake-up call.
"Wake-up call."

15:05.871 --> 15:09.642
Ricci's coming to say goodbye to
the boys. It's best I clear off.

15:11.477 --> 15:13.012
Where we going, hon?

15:13.078 --> 15:16.515
Oh, my God, I've had an amazing idea
to cheer me and Vicky up.

15:17.716 --> 15:19.551
Hi.

15:20.486 --> 15:23.122
Let's get another fish.
Hey, fishies.

15:25.157 --> 15:29.094
We could get one of these? You can
put those with Scramble and Egg.

15:29.161 --> 15:32.698
'Charlotte's been so upset
since she told Gary how she felt.'

15:32.765 --> 15:36.201
Some marine-based retail therapy
is obviously the answer.

15:36.268 --> 15:39.538
I quite like this black one.
I like the black ones.

15:39.605 --> 15:43.342
Scramble and Egg need to meet
new people but they're shy,

15:43.409 --> 15:45.411
we're gonna find them a new friend.

15:45.477 --> 15:49.548
Can we have him? He's got
the googliest eyes I've ever seen.

15:49.615 --> 15:52.284
And we'll call him Toast.
I like that.

15:52.351 --> 15:56.422
In your professional opinion,
will Scramble and Egg take to Toast?

15:56.488 --> 16:00.225
(chuckles) Yes, course they will.
What if they pick on him at first?

16:00.292 --> 16:03.462
Who would've thought
a slimy, google-eyed creature

16:03.529 --> 16:06.432
would actually help
take Charlotte's mind off Gary?

16:10.269 --> 16:14.073
(phone rings)
(Holly) I'm not going to work.

16:15.674 --> 16:17.409
Oi-oi?

16:17.476 --> 16:19.712
Me and Holly have got to go to work.

16:23.082 --> 16:26.185
Me and you, Holly,
are doing a stag do. Oh, man!

16:26.251 --> 16:29.121
For fuck's sake,
I can't entertain people right now.

16:40.666 --> 16:44.703
Me and Scott are taking this stag
party to a bucking bronco.

16:44.770 --> 16:48.140
The last big thing I've been riding
is Scotty T.

16:48.207 --> 16:52.378
Get to work, it's a big bunch of
lads, we'll just do what we do best.

16:52.444 --> 16:54.413
'Get fucking smashed.'

16:58.650 --> 17:02.788
Holly's single, so I'm gonna get her
set up with one of these lads.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.256
Hammering the shots!

17:04.323 --> 17:07.492
There's one lad there
who's actually quite hot.

17:07.559 --> 17:10.095
'I don't wanna neck on
with everybody else.'

17:10.162 --> 17:13.531
How the fuck?
He's like John Wayne, this kid.

17:13.598 --> 17:15.601
I don't know how!
(laughter)

17:16.667 --> 17:19.204
(cheering)

17:19.271 --> 17:22.540
I said the person with the
best score gets a kiss off Holly.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.609
This lad's got a girlfriend,

17:24.675 --> 17:29.548
so we're gonna go with the kid with
the lowest score, this kid here.

17:29.615 --> 17:33.051
I've bent the rules so Holly can
neck on with this lad she likes.

17:33.118 --> 17:36.688
She should be thanking us.
'Give her a kiss. Go on, son.'

17:36.755 --> 17:39.691
Everyone bangs on about me
having a thing with Holly,

17:39.758 --> 17:42.895
but this proves
I've got no feelings for her.

17:42.961 --> 17:45.798
It's good Scotty's being me wingman.

17:45.864 --> 17:47.933
Howay, was he a good kisser?

17:48.000 --> 17:50.169
Yeah, but just not as good as you.

17:50.235 --> 17:52.538
Fuck off.
(laughs)

17:52.604 --> 17:54.606
No-one's as good as me, though.

18:03.048 --> 18:05.284
Lads!
Oi-oi!

18:05.350 --> 18:06.618
We hear Ricci come in.

18:06.685 --> 18:08.921
What the fuck?
I thought they'd split up.

18:18.330 --> 18:22.401
I'm gonna have a night out with
the lads but at the end, go home.

18:22.468 --> 18:24.403
Me and Vicky still need space.

18:24.470 --> 18:27.873
I wanna fucking smash it tonight.
I'm gonna get ruined.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.883
I'm absolutely buzzing,
it's gonna be mint.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.284
Hola.

18:43.388 --> 18:46.391
No girls, no drama,
one place to be, Bijoux.

18:54.533 --> 18:58.904
I wanna make sure that Ricci has
a mint final night in Geordie Shore.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.240
Cheers to Ricci.
Let's get fucked.

19:01.306 --> 19:02.608
(cheering)

19:10.148 --> 19:13.452
I'm letting Toast out, set free.

19:13.519 --> 19:15.787
(gasps) Oh...

19:15.854 --> 19:18.123
'Oh, my God,
Scramble and Egg love Toast.'

19:18.190 --> 19:21.026
'It's like watching Dan,
Scott and Gary hanging out

19:21.093 --> 19:22.694
and sucking each other off.'

19:22.761 --> 19:24.329
Can fish suck each other off?

19:25.998 --> 19:28.467
He's called Toast.
Burnt Toast.

19:28.534 --> 19:30.502
What we wanna do
is go out for a meal.

19:30.569 --> 19:34.206
A nice, girly chat, and discuss
what the hell's been going on.

19:34.273 --> 19:37.075
Let's go.
Why do we look like a girl band?

19:45.117 --> 19:47.085
What happened with you and Ric?

19:47.152 --> 19:50.589
The short version
is just that he was just lovely.

19:50.656 --> 19:54.826
Vicky has give Ricci a bit of false
hope that they might get together

19:54.893 --> 19:56.695
when really this is the end.

19:56.762 --> 20:01.967
I've been given a new lease of life.
I'm just gonna enjoy meself.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.402
If I can get over Ricci,

20:03.468 --> 20:07.372
it's time Charlotte pulled them
slaggy socks up and got over Gaz.

20:07.439 --> 20:09.441
Where will we be
in a couple of years?

20:09.508 --> 20:13.879
You'll probably still be drinking
that drink. (laughter)

20:21.286 --> 20:25.090
Ricci's got a massive smile.
This is how a send-off should be.

20:37.169 --> 20:40.572
Out of the corner of me eye,
I spot Lindsey. Soz, lads, see you.

20:42.207 --> 20:46.478
This cougar who Dan necked on with
before Barcelona has just turned up.

20:46.545 --> 20:48.246
Hope she remembered her teeth.

20:48.313 --> 20:50.949
'This is meant to be
Ricci's send-off,

20:51.016 --> 20:53.852
this is no time to go home
and get breast-fed.'

21:04.296 --> 21:08.467
Ricci and Vicky have had nights out
apart. Never seen them so happy.

21:08.533 --> 21:12.104
Maybe they should split the fuck up
and do everyone a favour.

21:21.313 --> 21:25.917
Must be a weight off Gaz's shoulders
not to have Charlotte eyeing him.

21:25.984 --> 21:29.788
'Tonight is meant to be a good
send-off for Ricci, but no,

21:29.855 --> 21:32.491
the lads have went off
to get their dicks wet.'

21:40.232 --> 21:41.600
I feel sorry for Ricci.

21:41.667 --> 21:46.204
Classic night, with all you
boys there, mate, seriously.

21:46.271 --> 21:49.441
You fuck off home to your tiny
little house.

21:49.508 --> 21:52.644
OK.
(both laugh)

21:52.711 --> 21:55.380
Love you loads, mate.
You too. Have a good night.

21:55.447 --> 21:56.848
See you later.

21:56.915 --> 21:58.383
Fucking hell, I'm mortal.

21:58.450 --> 22:01.086
It feels so weird
that we're all going home

22:01.153 --> 22:02.888
and Ricci's not coming with us.

22:02.954 --> 22:07.626
The one thing I'm buzzing about is
I've got me own room. Cheers, Ricci.

22:08.293 --> 22:10.429
'Lindsey jumped in a cab with us

22:10.495 --> 22:13.765
and Gaz and Scott
are going home empty-handed.'

22:23.709 --> 22:27.846
(grunts)
I can't get my shoe off, man.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.282
Oh, my God.

22:30.348 --> 22:34.086
Fuck me. Scotty T's mortal.
No wonder he didn't pull tonight.

22:34.152 --> 22:36.688
His chat's bad enough
when he's sober.

22:40.292 --> 22:44.096
'Every time Dan's brought his bird
back, he's failed to buck her.'

22:44.162 --> 22:46.231
This is the third time.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.670
The cougar is in the nest.

22:57.709 --> 23:01.146
Every lad knows if you want a bird
to casually bang,

23:01.213 --> 23:04.082
you do not bring the same bird back
three times.

23:04.149 --> 23:07.252
She's got him jumping through hoops.

23:07.319 --> 23:10.555
I hope for his sake that Dan's
gonna make it third time lucky.

23:12.357 --> 23:15.127
It's time to full-on
have a proper house party.

23:15.193 --> 23:18.163
Everyone needs to get fancy dress.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.466
Is this just a complete stitch up?
(roars)

23:21.533 --> 23:24.436
I've given him the best BJ
a DJ could ever have.

23:25.670 --> 23:28.507
To tonight.
Fuck knows what'll happen.

23:28.573 --> 23:30.876
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

23:33.278 --> 23:33.478
.

23:36.214 --> 23:36.414
.

23:47.225 --> 23:48.326
Last night was mint.

23:48.393 --> 23:51.463
'Ricci's left,
but we gave him a proper send-off.'

23:52.664 --> 23:56.034
I've brought Lindsay back and
we've necked on in the bungalow.

23:59.638 --> 24:03.542
'Me and Gaz have gone to find out
if Dan sealed the deal.'

24:03.608 --> 24:05.010
Hash tag, did he fuck.

24:05.076 --> 24:06.845
Snuggle puffs.

24:10.148 --> 24:13.418
'Lindsay's still got
her underwear on, epic fail No 3.'

24:13.485 --> 24:17.789
'Why has Gaz and Scott suddenly
taken an interest in my sex life?'

24:17.856 --> 24:20.392
Maybe cos they didn't pull
last night.

24:27.632 --> 24:30.101
'I'm not bothered
about not banging.'

24:30.168 --> 24:34.439
You don't to to have a good time
with a bird. Fourth time lucky.

24:34.506 --> 24:36.208
Shut up.

24:36.274 --> 24:37.943
(farts)

24:38.009 --> 24:39.711
(laughter)

24:43.682 --> 24:47.819
We had a nice dinner, tried to get
the boys out of out system.

24:47.886 --> 24:51.456
Me and Holly were sitting up.
Why were you sitting up?

24:51.523 --> 24:54.759
Waiting to see
if Gary brought any girls back.

25:00.365 --> 25:03.902
Charlotte has been so upset
since she told Gary how she felt,

25:03.969 --> 25:07.005
and him being the sensitive
scrotum that he is,

25:07.072 --> 25:09.674
has not acknowledged her feelings
whatsoever.

25:12.043 --> 25:13.245
Lads, come through.

25:15.313 --> 25:17.215
We've called this family meeting

25:17.282 --> 25:20.118
to announce
that we wanna have a house party.

25:20.185 --> 25:24.022
It's time to full-on
have a proper house party.

25:24.089 --> 25:28.894
And we want it to be themed fancy
dress, you up for that? What as?

25:28.960 --> 25:32.964
We're gonna make it American themed,
everyone needs to get fancy dress.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.532
Loads of American stuff.

25:34.599 --> 25:36.668
That sounds mint.
Does it sound good?

25:36.735 --> 25:38.336
Sounds absolutely mint.

25:38.403 --> 25:42.440
We wanna have the most massive
and epic house party in history.

25:42.507 --> 25:45.210
(phone rings)

25:45.277 --> 25:46.811
"Hello?"
Hi.

25:46.878 --> 25:49.281
"How you doing, you all right?"
How are you?

25:49.347 --> 25:53.218
First things first,
you've gotta have some mint tunes.

25:53.285 --> 25:55.820
I'm gonna ring Joel
and see if he'll DJ.

25:55.887 --> 25:59.824
You can DJ, you can dress up...
"Yeah, definitely."

25:59.891 --> 26:04.562
..and then obviously, stay with me.
It'll be nice to see you too.

26:07.265 --> 26:10.402
Let's go to the fancy dress shop.
See you later.

26:18.310 --> 26:22.013
Dan said to me, "Don't stitch us up."
I was like, "I won't."

26:22.080 --> 26:26.685
We choose what the boys wear so
we wanna make them look like twats.

26:26.751 --> 26:28.820
Get him an old man's outfit,

26:28.887 --> 26:32.357
they could go as an old couple
and she wouldn't dress up.

26:35.694 --> 26:37.629
Who thought of the American theme?

26:37.696 --> 26:41.199
Me. Basically,
American people go over the top.

26:41.266 --> 26:43.301
'We're looking for costumes.'

26:43.368 --> 26:47.539
'I wanted to go as Action Man,
but then I wouldn't be dressing up.'

26:47.605 --> 26:51.209
I definitely think you should go
as this, with your little rock...

26:51.276 --> 26:56.915
I love doing this face. So the Kiss
outfit seems the obvious choice.

26:58.149 --> 27:00.185
I don't think anyone's that stupid.

27:00.251 --> 27:03.421
'I'm worried it
makes us look like a total bell-end,

27:03.488 --> 27:05.957
and I won't pull anyone.'

27:06.024 --> 27:07.292
You look really funny.

27:07.359 --> 27:08.960
We've got crazy costumes,

27:09.027 --> 27:12.130
and I can't wait
for everyone to get dressed up

27:12.197 --> 27:14.466
and make fucking idiots
of themselves.

27:20.805 --> 27:24.209
We wanna look pure fucking lethal
for the house party,

27:24.275 --> 27:26.544
so we're all off out to get ready.

27:37.889 --> 27:40.091
She's sound.
But she's not banging him.

27:40.158 --> 27:43.695
If Dan's bird comes to this party,
he's gonna get cock-blocked.

27:43.762 --> 27:46.998
He's not banging her and can't bang
anyone else. Oh, my God.

27:51.036 --> 27:53.605
It's the house party tonight.
Kate's coming.

27:53.671 --> 27:57.609
I've gotta make sure the SBC looks
slick. Short, back and comb over.

27:57.675 --> 28:03.014
You had that bird back again, that's
the third or the fourth night.

28:03.081 --> 28:07.018
She's a good craic, to be fair like.
'It's fun rinsing Dan about his bird

28:07.085 --> 28:10.255
but he's getting more action
than the Buck Squad.'

28:16.227 --> 28:17.429
Right, sweet.

28:19.464 --> 28:20.965
Yes.
Yeah?

28:21.032 --> 28:23.268
We've gone for a full body massage.'

28:23.334 --> 28:25.403
Only time Charlotte won't kick off

28:25.470 --> 28:29.007
when another girl's got her hands
all over me body. Naked.

28:29.074 --> 28:32.143
Did she mean naked?
Nah, boxers. D'you reckon?

28:32.210 --> 28:35.547
'I hope there's a couple of people
to do it, cos I'm massive.'

28:35.613 --> 28:37.348
Send in the troops.

28:39.184 --> 28:41.219
Hiya, you all right?

28:41.286 --> 28:42.854
(wolf whistle)

28:42.921 --> 28:44.589
(lewd shouting)

28:46.024 --> 28:50.428
Us girls love getting pampered,
it's time to get some nice facials.

28:50.495 --> 28:53.465
Do you think there'll be any boys
for you and Char-hole?

28:53.531 --> 28:56.367
Nah, when is there ever any boys
for me and Charlotte?

28:56.434 --> 28:58.303
Argh, you fucker!
(laughs)

28:58.369 --> 29:02.774
Scott and Gaz will invite a load
of slags, cos they wanna get bucked.

29:02.841 --> 29:06.244
Why don't you get them back
and pull their mates?

29:06.311 --> 29:09.948
I don't wanna shit on my own doorstep
by getting with Scott's mate

29:10.014 --> 29:13.218
and then not being able
to crawl into Scott's bed.

29:13.284 --> 29:17.288
Yeah, that's such a good window
of opportunity(!)

29:17.355 --> 29:20.792
It's just a convenient window.
I didn't say it was good.

29:23.294 --> 29:27.465
'If this goes smoothly, it'll be a
lot of boys for the girls to talk to

29:27.532 --> 29:31.069
and a lot of girls for the lads
to pull. That'd be perfect.'

29:38.810 --> 29:41.079
The party depends on
Charlotte's mood.

29:41.146 --> 29:45.783
To keep Charlotte away from Gaz,
find Charlotte a lad she likes

29:45.850 --> 29:47.552
to keep her occupied all night.

29:54.125 --> 29:55.393
I just can't wait.

30:03.401 --> 30:05.436
Argh, it's getting close.

30:05.503 --> 30:08.373
Anyone feeling horny?
No, I'm on me period.

30:08.439 --> 30:11.776
Well, if the river's red,
take the dirt track instead.

30:11.843 --> 30:15.046
With the all experience we've had
across Europe,

30:15.113 --> 30:17.649
we know how to throw the best party.

30:24.289 --> 30:27.358
Girls are decorating the house.
It's looking mint.

30:32.397 --> 30:34.399
You all right?
How are you?

30:35.633 --> 30:39.804
Joel's come to DJ and I know
he's gonna play some banging tunes

30:39.871 --> 30:42.340
and I hope he bangs me, too.

30:42.407 --> 30:44.342
(laughs)
(roars)

30:44.409 --> 30:47.946
'I think the girls thought I'd
refuse to wear the Tweety costume,

30:48.012 --> 30:50.648
but I'm absolutely buzzing.'
I'm a banana.

30:50.715 --> 30:55.587
Instead of making them angry,
they think these outfits are mint.

30:55.653 --> 30:57.155
I'm going as a Smurf.

30:59.557 --> 31:02.527
Gary's gone blue
cos he's had STI's for so long.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.262
(laughs)

31:04.329 --> 31:07.532
And I'm getting into me
Rocky costume, ding ding.

31:09.634 --> 31:12.103
So I'm going as
Gene Simmons from Kiss,

31:12.170 --> 31:14.839
the ultimate American rock band.

31:14.906 --> 31:18.376
Every house party we've had in
the past there's been fights.

31:18.443 --> 31:21.012
I hope there's gonna be
no kick-offs.

31:21.079 --> 31:23.047
Tonight.
Tonight and no drama.

31:23.114 --> 31:24.449
(cheering)

31:36.494 --> 31:40.598
I've got me pirate costume on,
it's just gonna be an unreal night.

31:52.710 --> 31:56.514
Lindsey rocks in, straight away
she stands out, she's gorgeous.

31:59.317 --> 32:01.886
In walks Lesley dressed as
fucking Baywatch.

32:03.121 --> 32:05.156
Baywatch, fucking right.

32:12.730 --> 32:16.601
So I'm at the house party and Kate
walks in dressed as Wonder Woman.

32:16.668 --> 32:19.203
Course, what else would she come as?

32:35.720 --> 32:38.823
'Joel's DJing tonight,
and he's DJing on the balcony.'

32:38.890 --> 32:42.560
The only thing I want him to do
on the balcony is buck us.

32:47.799 --> 32:53.738
'It's every DJ's dream to get
sucked off while you're playing.'

32:53.805 --> 32:58.643
I'm on me honkers, and I'm giving
him the best BJ a DJ could have.

33:05.717 --> 33:10.655
This is my first house party without
Ricci and it's a weird feeling,

33:10.722 --> 33:15.393
almost like I can relax and
spread me bat wings and just fly.

33:17.328 --> 33:20.365
The atmosphere's mint,
everyone's having a good time.

33:20.431 --> 33:24.235
I'm thinking that a Geordie Shore
party might have a happy ending.

33:31.509 --> 33:34.479
We are knee-deep in clunge,
it's ridiculous.

33:34.545 --> 33:38.349
'I am standing there looking like
an absolute wanker.'

33:38.416 --> 33:40.852
(shouting)

33:40.918 --> 33:42.620
Fuck off!
(screams)

33:42.687 --> 33:44.489
'Everyone's pure kicking off.'

33:44.555 --> 33:46.824
(shouts)

33:46.891 --> 33:49.160
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye.

33:51.596 --> 33:51.796
.

33:54.632 --> 33:54.832
.

34:11.849 --> 34:15.686
We're having a massive house party
and we're blasting the roof off.

34:19.991 --> 34:22.326
We're all having a wicked time.

34:28.966 --> 34:33.438
I'm hoping it isn't full of girls
and that there's some boys for me.

34:35.406 --> 34:39.277
There's a girl, then another girl,
another girl, five girls, ten girls.

34:39.342 --> 34:42.246
Shit, this ratio
is getting out of hand.

34:43.214 --> 34:46.217
Oh, my God. Hi, what's your name?

34:46.284 --> 34:50.121
'There's flocks and flock of girls
coming in and hardly any lads.'

34:50.188 --> 34:54.891
This is what we don't want cos
the girls are gonna cock block us.

34:56.494 --> 34:59.564
We are knee-deep in clunge,
it's fucking ridiculous.

34:59.630 --> 35:02.900
The ratio of cock to vagina
is just crazy.

35:02.967 --> 35:04.368
We need some boys.

35:07.104 --> 35:08.973
Oh, my God.

35:09.040 --> 35:13.544
This always happens, it's all for
the lads and nothing for the girls.

35:17.915 --> 35:21.719
I can just see Charlotte's face
and it's a fucking picture.

35:21.786 --> 35:25.723
Don't cry, don't cry, you'll ruin
your make-up. Promise me you wont.

35:25.790 --> 35:30.962
There's way more girls than boys and
I don't know where to put meself.

35:31.028 --> 35:34.565
I'm dressed like Gene Simmons, man.
Who's that?

35:34.632 --> 35:38.302
The leader of Kiss!
Why does no-one know who I am?

35:38.369 --> 35:40.238
I feel really sorry for Charlotte.

35:40.304 --> 35:44.141
You've got the girls turning up
with next to nowt on.

35:44.208 --> 35:46.677
Bless her.
She's dressed as a fucking bloke.

35:46.744 --> 35:50.181
Come on just have a laugh with us,
it's our party.

35:50.248 --> 35:53.584
Gene Simmons sounded like
a really good idea at the time,

35:53.651 --> 35:56.320
I thought,
"it's gonna be crazy, funny, wild,"

35:56.387 --> 36:00.525
and I am standing there
looking like an absolute wanker.

36:07.965 --> 36:10.368
This is the weirdest party
I've ever been to

36:10.434 --> 36:12.637
cos there's lots of girls
but no boys.

36:12.703 --> 36:16.140
'So Charlotte's just watching us,
waiting for me to pull.'

36:16.207 --> 36:20.811
I'm trying to have a good time,
but I can't help but watch Gary.

36:30.321 --> 36:34.158
I can just feel these eyes
burning in the back of me head.

36:36.193 --> 36:39.430
Fuck. She's keeping all eyes on Gaz.

36:45.036 --> 36:49.006
She hasn't been the same since she
told Gaz she loved him in Barcelona.

36:49.073 --> 36:52.176
Right now, she's laid all her cards
on the table

36:52.243 --> 36:56.847
and all he's got to do as a nice
human being is just respect it.

36:56.914 --> 37:00.518
I spot this girl and I decide
to give her a house tour.

37:00.585 --> 37:05.222
I catch a glimpse of them going up
the stairs and I get really angry.

37:05.289 --> 37:07.925
(cries) Out of nowhere, so angry.

37:09.760 --> 37:12.496
Boom, Charlotte darts past us.

37:12.563 --> 37:13.831
(shouting)

37:17.234 --> 37:19.770
What? What?
(both shout)

37:19.837 --> 37:22.907
Fuck knows what's happened.
I don't fucking like that!

37:22.974 --> 37:25.376
You know I don't!
What? What?!

37:25.443 --> 37:29.614
Charlotte, forget about it, man!
Fucking spoiling the party, man!

37:29.680 --> 37:32.650
I'm having a wicked time
and everyone's kicking off.

37:34.552 --> 37:36.687
You fucking deserve this!

37:36.754 --> 37:40.625
Everyone's pushing and shoving,
it looks like a sale at Primark.

37:40.691 --> 37:42.326
(shouting)

37:42.393 --> 37:45.262
I've never seen venom in her eyes
like that, ever.

37:45.329 --> 37:49.700
(all shout)
Don't you dare fucking hit her!

37:49.767 --> 37:55.006
Everyone's getting in the middle.
I'm going for Gary. I'm so angry.

37:55.072 --> 37:58.709
Whoa, whoa, stop, stop it now. Stop.

37:58.776 --> 38:01.412
I've seen Charlotte
and Gaz argue before...

38:01.479 --> 38:05.850
Tell her, get out.
...but this one tops it by a mile.

38:07.351 --> 38:10.388
Gary, chill. Chill, chill, chill.

38:10.454 --> 38:15.026
'This has gone too far. I'm honestly
stuck and I don't know what to do.'

38:18.796 --> 38:22.767
I see a massive, angry blue Smurf
coming down the stairs.

38:26.370 --> 38:28.205
What?

38:28.272 --> 38:30.808
What the fuck's he on about?
(shouting)

38:30.875 --> 38:33.644
I need some space.
I'm leaving the mad house.

38:36.013 --> 38:37.014
Fuck off!

38:37.081 --> 38:39.083
Fuck! Why?

38:39.150 --> 38:42.219
Gary storms out,
and it's a good thing he does.

38:42.286 --> 38:46.557
There are too many people at this
party who are seriously mad at him.

38:50.227 --> 38:51.362
Let's crack on.

38:51.429 --> 38:54.732
Shock, we've had a party
and it's all kicked off.

38:54.799 --> 38:58.736
Hands in the air if you wanna party.
(cheering)

38:58.803 --> 39:01.806
Kick-off or no kick-off,
I'm getting balls deep.

39:07.078 --> 39:09.947
'Where is Scotty T
in this massive confrontation?'

39:10.014 --> 39:13.350
Sniffing round for fucking fanny.
Nice one, Scott.

39:22.727 --> 39:26.330
This is the angriest I've ever been,
something just comes over us.

39:26.397 --> 39:29.100
(screams)

39:29.166 --> 39:31.068
I feel really bad.

39:32.336 --> 39:34.338
You're not gonna faint.
I am.

39:34.405 --> 39:36.640
Get her on my bed,
get her on my bed. Ready?

39:36.707 --> 39:39.643
One, two, three, four, up she comes.

39:42.213 --> 39:45.382
Gaz has left the house,
Dan's on Nana duty

39:45.449 --> 39:48.786
and she won't bang him,
so Scotty T's left to clean up.

40:02.833 --> 40:06.704
I thought Scott had wing-manned us,
pulling one of Lindsey's friends,

40:06.771 --> 40:09.507
turns out he's pulling
all the party stragglers.

40:09.573 --> 40:11.675
That kind of hurts.

40:14.945 --> 40:17.681
While Scott's giving his number
to birds,

40:17.748 --> 40:19.650
I'm gonna take Lindsey off to bed.

40:23.654 --> 40:28.025
Fuck, Scotty T's been caught red-
handed doing a bit of multi-tasking.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.627
Bye.

40:31.495 --> 40:35.466
Looks like Scott's over-stretched
himself and blocked his own cock,

40:35.533 --> 40:37.067
hash tag, nightmare.

40:41.372 --> 40:45.042
Charlotte's sustained an injury
and her ankle is a bit swollen.

40:45.109 --> 40:48.145
Everybody knows
I'm brilliant at being a nurse,

40:48.212 --> 40:51.749
but the only thing I can find
is Turkey Dinosaurs.

40:51.816 --> 40:55.519
This isn't the party we planned.
I thought it might get past the hour

40:55.586 --> 40:58.856
before it transcended into
complete and utter anarchy.

41:03.194 --> 41:08.032
Rocky's off for 12 rounds
with Wonder Woman. Lucky girl.

41:13.704 --> 41:18.742
So we've got rid of the hangers-on
and I think, "Now the tunes are off,

41:18.809 --> 41:22.813
get me to bed, Joel,
just bloody give us some loving."

41:30.187 --> 41:33.891
I've grafted with Lindsey all night,
I've played all me cards right.

41:33.958 --> 41:37.228
I've been a gentleman. Hopefully,
it's time to seal the deal.

41:40.264 --> 41:42.132
What a life-saver.

41:49.640 --> 41:52.109
(cries) Ow.

41:52.176 --> 41:56.981
I can't believe he would do this in
front of me face. I'm just so angry.

41:57.047 --> 42:01.685
He's just destroyed us as a person
and I hate him for it.

42:01.752 --> 42:06.624
I think it's finally sunk in to Gaz
just exactly how Charlotte feels

42:06.690 --> 42:08.859
and it's about time.

42:08.926 --> 42:12.763
'I feel like, slowly but surely,
he's broke us down.'

42:12.830 --> 42:17.268
It took us so much courage to tell
him that I was in love with him,

42:17.334 --> 42:20.304
and he'd still go on
the way he does.

42:20.371 --> 42:23.574
(sobs) I feel like
he's just destroyed us.

42:23.641 --> 42:25.209
Ow!

42:25.276 --> 42:28.545
'Couldn't have picked a worse person
to fall in love with.'

42:28.612 --> 42:31.782
Everyone knows
that Gaz is about one thing,

42:31.849 --> 42:35.419
and that's banging.
He doesn't do relationships.

42:35.486 --> 42:38.589
I hope he's gone forever.
I don't wanna see him again.

42:39.590 --> 42:41.558
Everything was going brilliantly,

42:41.625 --> 42:44.895
but now Gary's left,
Charlotte's foot's probably broken.

42:44.962 --> 42:48.265
I don't know how they
can ever be friends again.

42:49.934 --> 42:52.503
Pack, leave and I'll be in touch.

42:52.569 --> 42:54.338
See you.
I love you.

42:54.405 --> 42:56.307
I'm trying to make amends.

42:56.373 --> 42:58.509
Guess where we're going?

42:59.743 --> 43:04.348
We might be in the French Alps, but
the boy-girl divide came with us.

43:04.415 --> 43:08.719
Can you imagine my disgust
when in walks Joel?

43:08.786 --> 43:11.021
(screams) I don't like it!

43:11.088 --> 43:12.923
Dan is smashed.

43:14.425 --> 43:17.861
Getting in your bed. Is this
what being single feels like?

43:17.928 --> 43:20.397
It's our last night,
go out with a bang.

43:20.464 --> 43:22.399
That's what you've done.

43:22.466 --> 43:24.468
(all) Geordie Shore!

43:24.535 --> 43:25.936
Bye, house.

43:50.894 --> 43:51.095
.
