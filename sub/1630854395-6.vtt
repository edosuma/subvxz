<i>[upbeat saxophone music]</i>

00:07.215 --> 00:08.675
<i>- It's your dad's</i>
<i>first Christmas with us.</i>

00:08.717 --> 00:10.010
How's it feel?

00:10.051 --> 00:11.344
- I'm just happy we get
to spend <i>Nochebuena</i>

00:11.386 --> 00:12.846
with both my parents.

00:12.887 --> 00:16.391
We'll eat and dance,
open presents at midnight.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.435
- Are we still gonna do
the Lopez family tradition

00:18.476 --> 00:21.312
of dressing up and singing
<i>"Mi Burrito Sabanero"?</i>

00:21.354 --> 00:25.191
* Because I've been
rehearsing all week *

00:27.610 --> 00:28.695
- Definitely.

00:28.737 --> 00:31.239
My dad always loved
playing the burro.

00:31.281 --> 00:34.284
- Wait, but I play the kid
who rides the burro.

00:34.325 --> 00:35.744
Does that mean
I have to ride your dad?

00:35.785 --> 00:38.121
- No, you'll still be
riding my mom.

00:38.163 --> 00:40.749
- Yes!

00:40.790 --> 00:42.167
- We're here.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.710
- Can you let me talk?

00:43.752 --> 00:45.378
We're here.

00:45.420 --> 00:46.963
- We went to Olive Garden,

00:47.005 --> 00:48.256
and we brought back
unlimited salad.

00:48.298 --> 00:49.674
You should eat it
within the hour

00:49.716 --> 00:52.427
before it turns to soup.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.554
- Were you guys on a date?

00:54.596 --> 00:56.097
- Ew! As if.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.351
We went to talk
about Christmas.

00:59.392 --> 01:00.685
- We were just talking
about how nice it is

01:00.727 --> 01:01.853
that we're all
gonna be together.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.063
- Aww, yeah.

01:03.104 --> 01:05.732
We're not doing that.

01:05.774 --> 01:06.900
- What?

01:06.941 --> 01:08.276
- Yeah, we decided to split it.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.236
I get <i>Nochebuena</i>
and Christmas morning.

01:10.278 --> 01:11.571
- And I get to go
to Oscar's house

01:11.613 --> 01:12.822
and eat pizza, watch the game,

01:12.864 --> 01:15.575
and then take a trip
to the North Pole.

01:15.617 --> 01:18.661
That's a strip club
in Van Nuys.

01:18.703 --> 01:21.748
I'ma make it rain, dear.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.958
- But I thought
you two were getting along.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.377
You just went to lunch.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.087
- Yeah, we can get
through one meal

01:27.128 --> 01:28.505
as long as there's
no appetizers,

01:28.546 --> 01:30.298
no dessert, and your dad
hides in the bathroom

01:30.340 --> 01:32.550
until I pay the bill.

01:32.592 --> 01:33.843
- And that's why
we're not gonna

01:33.885 --> 01:34.928
be together on <i>Nochebuena.</i>

01:34.969 --> 01:36.012
Hell, why wait?

01:36.054 --> 01:37.055
Let's start now.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.099
Bye, bruja.

01:39.140 --> 01:41.309
- Bye, <i>borracho.</i>

01:44.604 --> 01:45.647
- I'm sorry.

01:45.689 --> 01:46.981
I know you wanted
to spend Christmas

01:47.023 --> 01:48.441
with both your parents.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.402
- Oh, we're spending
Christmas together,

01:50.443 --> 01:53.571
even if I have to drag the joy
out of them by force.

01:55.156 --> 02:00.161
- * That sounds horrible *

02:00.203 --> 02:03.123
<i>[upbeat saxophone music]</i>

02:03.164 --> 02:10.338
<i>* *</i>

02:15.343 --> 02:16.511
- All right, how do we
celebrate Christmas?

02:16.553 --> 02:18.430
The North Pole shut down.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.640
We could go
to Jiggle All the Way.

02:20.682 --> 02:24.394
- Or you can stay here with
your favorite boob, Quinten.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.814
- You gotta stay, George.

02:27.856 --> 02:32.485
I am making traditional
Mexican tamales just for you.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.154
I have a secret ingredient.

02:34.195 --> 02:35.697
- Is it molly?

02:38.241 --> 02:40.660
- No, it's jalapeños.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.203
[chuckles]

02:42.245 --> 02:43.538
- That's not a secret.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.498
Everyone knows
what jalapeños are.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.251
- Rosie and I
made an agreement,

02:48.293 --> 02:50.253
and unlike our marriage,
I'm gonna honor it.

02:50.295 --> 02:51.880
I'll be gone
for her favorite holiday,

02:51.921 --> 02:53.256
and she'll be gone for mine.

02:53.298 --> 02:54.257
- Which one?

02:54.299 --> 02:56.760
- Cinco de Mayo.

02:56.801 --> 02:59.095
I mad dog every gringo
in a sombrero

02:59.137 --> 03:00.930
until they buy me a drink.

03:03.266 --> 03:06.436
God bless white guilt.

03:06.478 --> 03:09.522
- So what if I get Mom
to change her mind?

03:09.564 --> 03:12.275
Would you stay for Christmas
for me,

03:12.317 --> 03:14.819
your one and only daughter
that we know of?

03:17.447 --> 03:18.865
- No, I can't handle
your mom on Christmas.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.533
She goes overboard
with the decorations.

03:20.575 --> 03:23.286
She crowns herself
<i>La Reina de Navidad.</i>

03:23.328 --> 03:26.623
She invites more Cubans
than are in Cuba.

03:26.664 --> 03:29.834
- But if I get her to tone it
down, you'll come, right?

03:29.876 --> 03:30.960
- Sure, Mayan.

03:31.002 --> 03:32.170
It'll be a Christmas miracle

03:32.212 --> 03:33.421
if you get anywhere
with that <i>loca.</i>

03:33.463 --> 03:34.839
- Oh, I'm a <i>loca?</i>

03:34.881 --> 03:36.633
Do I look like a <i>loca</i>to you?

03:39.427 --> 03:41.805
- This sounds like underwear.

03:42.806 --> 03:45.767
- Chance, Christmas isn't
just about getting presents.

03:45.809 --> 03:48.311
- Does Nana know that?
'Cause don't tell her.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.481
- See?
He doesn't understand

03:51.523 --> 03:53.400
what the true meaning
of Christmas is.

03:53.441 --> 03:54.734
That's why I came over here.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.403
We need to spend Christmas
as a family.

03:56.444 --> 03:57.696
- We are doing that.

03:57.737 --> 04:00.407
- With Dad.
- I'm out.

04:00.448 --> 04:01.741
He's just gonna ruin everything

04:01.783 --> 04:04.536
by passing out on the couch
way before midnight.

04:04.577 --> 04:07.414
We'll be carrying him
up the stairs, singing,

04:07.455 --> 04:10.542
* Joy to the world,
the drunk is done *

04:11.668 --> 04:13.086
- This year will be different.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.170
- How?

04:14.212 --> 04:17.298
- Because Dad's already agreed

04:17.340 --> 04:19.092
not to drink on <i>Nochebuena.</i>

04:19.134 --> 04:20.927
- He has?
- He has?

04:20.969 --> 04:23.054
- He has.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.765
- Well, I guess
if your father's agreed

04:25.807 --> 04:28.518
to stop drinking,
I can give up a little too.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.311
I don't want him to win.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.815
- Great, so we're gonna
keep it small--

04:33.857 --> 04:34.858
just us.

04:34.899 --> 04:36.484
- But it's not
a Latino Christmas

04:36.526 --> 04:38.445
unless there's at least
ten family members.

04:38.486 --> 04:40.113
I even invited the garbage man.

04:40.155 --> 04:42.741
Now he's gonna think I'm trash.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.826
- And just one Christmas tree.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.999
- One is for Santa,

04:51.041 --> 04:54.044
and one is for Jesus.

04:54.085 --> 04:56.463
It's his birthday.

04:56.504 --> 04:58.256
Oh, should I throw away
the cake

04:58.298 --> 04:59.883
that I made for him too?

05:04.804 --> 05:06.222
<i>[upbeat saxophone music]</i>

05:06.264 --> 05:08.141
- "Feliz Navi-Dad."

05:08.183 --> 05:09.726
You don't have to prove
you're a dork, bro.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.186
We already know.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.272
- Tamales are messy,

05:14.314 --> 05:16.316
and I don't want to get stains
on my sweater.

05:19.736 --> 05:22.614
- I got you premium masa
for your tamales

05:22.655 --> 05:25.283
from a guy
known as the Masa Man.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.827
He'll only meet in the alley
behind Big Lots,

05:27.869 --> 05:30.163
like they did
in the old country.

05:30.205 --> 05:31.831
- He sells another kind of masa

05:31.873 --> 05:33.375
that'll light up your nose
like Rudolph.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.006
- This is gonna be fun
because I found

05:40.048 --> 05:42.550
a great recipe
for traditional Mexican tamales

05:42.592 --> 05:45.845
by the Barefoot Contessa.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.931
She adds walnuts.

05:51.559 --> 05:54.938
- When you cook,
you gotta cook with passion--

05:54.979 --> 05:58.942
tears, sweat, unspoken desire.

06:00.235 --> 06:03.196
- That sounds like
a health code violation.

06:03.238 --> 06:06.116
- Haven't you seen
the classic 1992 film,

06:06.157 --> 06:07.867
"Like Water for Chocolate"?

06:07.909 --> 06:11.079
The secret to great masa
is <i>mas amor.</i>

06:13.415 --> 06:17.460
- Okay, you want to help me
make these tamales?

06:17.502 --> 06:19.087
<i>Auténtico?</i>

06:21.548 --> 06:23.550
- Fine, but I gotta warn you.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.176
You're not gonna want
to wear that sweater

06:25.218 --> 06:27.220
on <i>Nochebuena,</i> because...

06:27.262 --> 06:31.016
[whispering] It's gonna get
real steamy in here.

06:33.101 --> 06:35.061
[normally]
We need to steam the tamales

06:35.103 --> 06:37.522
for approximately 35 minutes,
so...

06:40.108 --> 06:41.609
- There's something wrong
with this beer.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.319
Try it. Ugh.

06:45.447 --> 06:46.865
- Mm.

06:46.906 --> 06:49.701
Just as good as beer
that contains alcohol.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.453
- Oh!

06:51.494 --> 06:53.580
Is this fake beer?

06:53.621 --> 06:55.331
"Nodelo."

06:59.044 --> 07:00.837
- I just thought
you might want to try

07:00.879 --> 07:02.422
being sober for <i>Nochebuena</i>

07:02.464 --> 07:04.466
so you can stay up
till midnight.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.926
Won't that be a nice
Christmas memory for Chance?

07:06.968 --> 07:08.636
- Oh, man,
Christmas without beer

07:08.678 --> 07:10.972
is like Easter without beer.

07:14.559 --> 07:15.935
- Please, Dad?

07:15.977 --> 07:17.979
We can celebrate
just like we used to.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.731
You can consider it
your Christmas gift to me.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.859
- Well, since I got you nothing
and I can't return it

07:22.901 --> 07:26.404
'cause I didn't keep
the receipt,

07:26.446 --> 07:30.367
I guess I could go
one day without beer.

07:32.077 --> 07:34.954
- Or wine, hard liquor,
or mouthwash.

07:36.706 --> 07:42.212
<i>* *</i>

07:42.253 --> 07:43.838
<i>It's</i>Nochebuena, <i>gordo.</i>

07:43.880 --> 07:45.048
<i>Time to light the tree.</i>

07:45.090 --> 07:46.424
You want to turn it on?

07:48.551 --> 07:50.845
- Let's get lit.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.389
Oh, wow.

07:52.430 --> 07:53.556
- Oh, no.

07:54.891 --> 07:58.311
That tree is barely dressed.

07:58.353 --> 08:01.272
Well, don't worry.
I brought more ornaments.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.525
- Mom, you agreed
to take it down a notch.

08:03.566 --> 08:04.859
- I am.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.611
I only went to one
of my storage lockers.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.906
- Hi, my name is George,
and I've been sober

08:09.948 --> 08:13.201
for 45 minutes.

08:13.243 --> 08:14.911
Wow, the tree looks great.

08:14.953 --> 08:16.496
Where's my--
where's my ornament,

08:16.538 --> 08:19.582
the one with Santa being
pulled by the cholo Chihuahuas?

08:21.584 --> 08:23.503
On, Sad Girl. On, Creeper.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.630
On, Puppet. On, Dreamer.

08:27.132 --> 08:29.384
- I threw those out years ago.
It clashed.

08:29.426 --> 08:32.137
- Clashed with what?
- Taste.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.221
- I'll give you something
that you could ta--

08:33.263 --> 08:36.141
- Okay, how about we do

08:36.182 --> 08:38.018
everyone's favorite tradition,

08:38.059 --> 08:39.811
<i>"Mi Burrito Sabanero"?</i>

08:39.853 --> 08:41.062
Quinten!

08:41.104 --> 08:42.689
- Is it time to ride?

08:42.731 --> 08:44.065
Saddle up, Rosie.

08:44.107 --> 08:46.109
It is a long way to Bethlehem.

08:50.155 --> 08:52.240
- But wait, wait, wait, I--
I'm the burro.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.992
- Well, you wandered off
the barn ten years ago.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.161
A lot has changed.
I am the burro now.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.206
- This is how
we always do it, Grandpa.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.043
- Oh, but don't worry, Dad.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.502
There's plenty
of other good parts.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.380
- Not really.
- Not helping.

09:07.422 --> 09:09.215
- It's all good.
I'll be Mary's nosy neighbor.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.550
The one that has seen so much

09:10.592 --> 09:12.010
that she knows
she ain't a virgin.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.678
So...

09:13.720 --> 09:14.804
you guys get started.

09:14.846 --> 09:16.806
I'll go get some binoculars.

09:16.848 --> 09:19.726
- Remember that year
Nana farted in Dad's face?

09:19.768 --> 09:22.604
- [laughs] I was a burro.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.731
I was in character.

09:24.773 --> 09:25.857
- Here we go.
- [laughs]

09:25.899 --> 09:27.233
- Here we go. Here we go.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.777
Jumping in, and we're in.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.946
[laughter]

09:36.451 --> 09:38.661
- You're getting too excited,
Quinten.

09:38.703 --> 09:41.539
- I think she did it again.
She did it again.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.375
Oh, Rosie.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.336
[laughter]

09:50.006 --> 09:52.300

I really could have used two.

- And is that a new crown?

11:44.829 --> 11:46.873

that the wreath on the door

We are not fighting

This is all your fault.

- What?
- Yeah.

12:48.810 --> 12:51.730
Don't act so innocent,
Virgin Mary.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.191
- Your mother and I had this
all worked out.

All this could have
been avoided

12:56.484 --> 12:57.986
if you didn't force me
to be here.

12:58.028 --> 13:02.032
- Yeah, and you didn't force me
to dim my Christmas light.

13:02.073 --> 13:04.701
I am the North Star!

13:04.743 --> 13:06.870
- Wait, you guys don't get
to be mad at me.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.455
I'm mad at you.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.082
I just wanted my family
together for Christmas.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.334
Is that too much to ask?

13:12.375 --> 13:13.960
- Absolutely!
- Yes!

13:16.421 --> 13:18.131
- Then don't be here.

Get out.

Oh, no,
it's just one old dummy.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.608
- I just wanted to say
I'm sorry

14:18.650 --> 14:20.110
that you're alone
on Christmas, Rosie.

14:20.151 --> 14:22.862
I brought you a coffee.

14:22.904 --> 14:25.073
- Thanks.
- Hey, what are you--

14:25.115 --> 14:26.533
come on, Rosie,
don't leave me freezing

14:26.574 --> 14:27.534
out here on your porch.

14:27.575 --> 14:28.576
It's Christmas.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.787
- It's 72 degrees.

Fine, come in.

You can't ruin <i>Nochebuena</i>

14:38.712 --> 14:41.423
- I really was trying
not to drink.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.633
- And I was trying
not to overdo it.

14:46.678 --> 14:50.473
I'm sorry if I set you off.

14:50.515 --> 14:52.976
- No.
[clears throat]

14:53.018 --> 14:54.477
It wasn't you.

14:54.519 --> 14:58.273
It was <i>"Mi Burrito Sabanero."</i>

14:58.314 --> 15:00.608
I mean, seeing you guys
having fun

15:00.650 --> 15:03.486
doing our traditions without me

15:03.528 --> 15:05.739
just made me realize
how much I missed

15:05.780 --> 15:07.323
the last ten years,
and that you can't get

15:07.365 --> 15:09.534
those Christmas memories back.

15:11.119 --> 15:13.955
- Well, I thought you were
making memories with Oscar,

15:13.997 --> 15:17.375
eating microwave pizza
in his mother's garage.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.713
- I just made that up
to make you jealous.

15:24.883 --> 15:27.385
The truth is that I've been
alone on Christmas

15:27.427 --> 15:29.220
for the last ten years.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.599
And it's a hard day for me.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.393
So I-I drink to get through it.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.022
- I ate God's cake.

15:46.071 --> 15:50.617
Oh, George, it's been
hard for us too.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.912
The reason why I started
going overboard on Christmas

15:53.953 --> 15:55.789
was to distract us
from the fact

15:55.830 --> 15:58.708
that you weren't there.

16:00.377 --> 16:04.589
I put all my sadness
into an elaborate nativity set.

16:06.341 --> 16:09.969
We did have a few
good Christmases, didn't we?

16:10.011 --> 16:12.847
I can see why Mayan
wanted us together.

16:14.057 --> 16:15.934
- I mean, it's not
too late, Rosie.

16:15.975 --> 16:19.020
I mean, we still have
a couple hours before midnight.

16:19.062 --> 16:22.816
And I've been sober
for another 45 minutes.

16:22.857 --> 16:25.026
Thank you, gas station potato.

16:26.569 --> 16:28.071

to make Jesus a second cake.

- They were naughty,
so Santa said

16:43.086 --> 16:44.629
they can't have dinner
with us tonight.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.881
- Santa's tearing
this whole family apart.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.803
both: We're here.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.471

start fighting

16:53.513 --> 16:54.723
and blame it on me again?

16:54.764 --> 16:57.350

this was all about family,

17:05.400 --> 17:07.694
- How about an apology first?

17:07.736 --> 17:10.572
- I'm sorry
that your <i>lechón</i>is so dry.

17:11.614 --> 17:13.158

17:19.414 --> 17:20.373

17:20.415 --> 17:21.708
it's a real Latino Christmas

17:21.750 --> 17:24.169
unless there's at least
ten family members,

17:24.210 --> 17:26.171
so...

17:26.212 --> 17:27.339
hello, family.

Ahh!

17:39.476 --> 17:43.188
Ay, this is
the best gift ever!

17:43.229 --> 17:44.689
- Yeah, and it didn't
cost me nothing.

17:44.731 --> 17:48.109
- Oh, thank you, George.

17:48.151 --> 17:49.903
Where's your husband?
- I don't know.

17:49.944 --> 17:51.905
I haven't seen him since 2007.

17:53.907 --> 17:57.035
But I hear he has a new family
and a better haircut.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.247
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

18:01.289 --> 18:02.624
- Sup.

- You know.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.086
- Sure do.

18:09.172 --> 18:10.382
- Ooh, presents.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.591
What did you get me?

18:11.633 --> 18:13.093
- What'd you get me?

18:13.134 --> 18:14.260
both: This fool.

in so long, George.

18:19.766 --> 18:23.228

just got bigger.

know that?

Aren't most old bats blind

18:28.316 --> 18:29.275
- Okay.
- Hold on.

18:29.317 --> 18:32.654
- Okay, come in. Come in.

to be Chance's father.

To Rosie, <i>La Reina de Navidad.</i>

19:21.286 --> 19:24.122
And to our old friends,
we've missed you.

19:26.291 --> 19:30.003
And finally,
to your deadbeat husband.

19:30.045 --> 19:32.380
But I kind of like that guy.

19:34.090 --> 19:37.385
And if you see him,
tell him I said hello.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.688
You can finally open
your presents.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.357
- Grandpa should
open his first.

19:50.398 --> 19:51.816
- What?

19:53.443 --> 19:54.903
- This is from me.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.821
You can't give me nothing,
but that doesn't mean

19:56.863 --> 19:58.406
you don't deserve something.

20:00.492 --> 20:03.828

Christmas is all about family.

- Shh!
- Sorry.

This is the most beautiful gift
I've ever gotten.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.468
It's even better
than your love.

But I'm gonna save this
for tomorrow, okay, boy?

20:24.099 --> 20:26.518
I'm gonna put it right here.
