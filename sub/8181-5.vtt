WEBVTT

00:06.139 --> 00:07.905
CARRIE, I NEED YOU!

00:07.973 --> 00:10.142
I'M WORKING, DAD!

00:10.209 --> 00:12.477
MY FISH STICKS
ARE BURNING.

00:12.545 --> 00:14.979
SO TAKE THEM OUT
OF THE OVEN.

00:15.047 --> 00:16.481
YOU SAID I WASN'T
ALLOWED NEAR THE OVEN.

00:16.549 --> 00:18.683
MAKE UP YOUR MIND,
MUSSOLINI!

00:18.751 --> 00:22.287
IT'S OK, DAD.

00:22.355 --> 00:24.156
WHERE DO YOU HIDE
THE OVEN MITTS?

00:24.223 --> 00:28.726
I HIDE THEM ON A HOOK
OVER THE OVEN.

00:28.794 --> 00:30.962
ALL I SEE
ARE PINK PUPPETS.

00:31.030 --> 00:34.065
THOSE ARE
THE OVEN MITTS!

00:34.133 --> 00:35.933
THEY'RE BOTH LEFTIES!

00:39.905 --> 00:42.174
HAVE YOU BEEN SITTING THERE
THIS WHOLE TIME?

00:42.241 --> 00:44.376
UH, YEAH.

00:44.443 --> 00:47.646
COULD YOU GO IN THERE AND
PLEASE TAKE CARE OF THIS?

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here

00:56.855 --> 00:57.789
HEY!

00:57.856 --> 00:59.658
HEY, HEY!
THOSE ARE MINE!

01:01.294 --> 01:03.027
IT'S ALL TAKEN CARE OF.

01:03.095 --> 01:04.696
THANKS, BABY.

01:43.936 --> 01:44.869
HEY, ARTHUR.

01:44.937 --> 01:46.938
AH, YOU'RE JUST
IN TIME TO JOIN ME

01:47.005 --> 01:49.074
IN A BOWL
OF FIBER 4,000.

01:49.141 --> 01:52.843
THIS STUFF REALLY SHOWS
YOUR COLON WHO'S BOSS.

01:52.911 --> 01:56.547
UM, NOT SURE
WOMEN HAVE COLONS.

01:56.615 --> 01:58.716
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE MISSING.

01:58.784 --> 01:59.951
LISTEN, ARTHUR,

02:00.019 --> 02:02.053
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING,

02:02.121 --> 02:03.488
I'M AFRAID I'M NOT
GOING TO BE ABLE

02:03.555 --> 02:05.890
TO WALK YOU ANYMORE.
WHAT?

02:05.958 --> 02:08.326
I MET A GUY AND HE WANTS ME
TO MOVE TO MANHATTAN.

02:08.394 --> 02:11.196
AND SO THE DOLLAR
DANCE BEGINS.

02:11.263 --> 02:14.365
LET'S SKIP THE FAIRY TALE
AND GET TO THE REAL STORY.

02:14.433 --> 02:16.000
YOU WANT A RAISE.

02:16.068 --> 02:17.835
NO, NO, NO.
I'M QUITTING,

02:17.903 --> 02:20.671
AND I WAS KIND OF HOPING
YOU'D GIVE ME YOUR BLESSING.

02:20.739 --> 02:22.073
HI, CARR.
OH, HEY.

02:22.141 --> 02:25.844
DARLING, YOU'RE JUST IN TIME.
HOLLY HAS SOME "BIG NEWS."

02:25.911 --> 02:30.615
SHE'S "MOVING" TO "MANHATTAN"
WITH HER "BOYFRIEND."

02:30.683 --> 02:34.219
NEEDLESS TO SAY,
I'M "DEVASTATED."

02:35.887 --> 02:37.455
HMM.

02:37.523 --> 02:39.190
WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:39.258 --> 02:42.293
WELL, I MET A GUY.
I MEAN, HE'S GREAT.

02:42.361 --> 02:45.330
HE'S SWEET AND FUNNY
AND, BOY,

02:45.398 --> 02:47.665
WHEN THE LIGHTS GO OUT,
WE JUST-

02:47.733 --> 02:51.169
WHOA, EASY THERE, GIRL.

02:51.237 --> 02:53.437
SO, WHO IS THIS GUY?
HOW'D YOU MEET HIM?

02:53.505 --> 02:55.974
WELL, UM... WE MET.

02:56.041 --> 02:58.610
WE JUST MET!
HE'S AMAZING!

02:58.677 --> 03:01.379
WELL, THAT ANSWERS THAT.

03:01.447 --> 03:02.947
YEAH, AND HE SAYS
WE'RE GONNA STAY

03:03.015 --> 03:04.482
IN A PENTHOUSE
IN MANHATTAN,

03:04.550 --> 03:05.517
AND HE CAN AFFORD IT

03:05.584 --> 03:07.385
'CAUSE HE OWNS
HIS OWN LIMO COMPANY.

03:07.452 --> 03:09.353
RIIIIGHT.

03:09.421 --> 03:10.855
WHAT IS IT?

03:10.923 --> 03:12.824
NOTHING. IT'S JUST NOT THE
FIRST TIME YOU'VE WALKED IN HERE

03:12.892 --> 03:15.159
ALL EXCITED ABOUT
SOME AMAZING GUY YOU MET,

03:15.227 --> 03:18.262
AND, WELL, IT JUST HASN'T
WORKED OUT THAT WAY.

03:18.330 --> 03:20.030
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:20.098 --> 03:20.932
WELL, LIKE THE TIME

03:21.066 --> 03:22.466
YOU WERE DATING
THAT GUY WHO TOLD YOU

03:22.535 --> 03:25.236
HE WAS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR
OF NEW JERSEY.

03:25.303 --> 03:27.004
SPIKE?

03:27.072 --> 03:28.939
YEAH.

03:29.007 --> 03:31.209
YEAH, HE WAS PROBABLY LYING. YEAH. YEAH.

03:31.277 --> 03:33.578
BUT CARL'S DIFFERENT,
I JUST KNOW IT.

03:33.645 --> 03:34.778
AND I HOPE SO, YOU KNOW,

03:34.846 --> 03:36.247
BUT BEFORE YOU UPROOT
YOUR WHOLE LIFE,

03:36.314 --> 03:37.682
YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT
WANT TO CHECK OUT

03:37.750 --> 03:39.517
IF CARL REALLY IS
WHO HE SAYS HE IS,

03:39.585 --> 03:42.386
YOU KNOW, AND THAT HE'S
REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT YOU.

03:42.454 --> 03:43.621
YOU'RE RIGHT. I MEAN,
WHAT IF I FIND OUT

03:43.688 --> 03:45.589
HE'S JUST ANOTHER
LYING CREEP?

03:45.657 --> 03:47.125
YEP. WELL, THEN
I GET A CALL SAYING,

03:47.192 --> 03:49.227
"THEY CUT ME OFF AT O'DOOLEY'S.
CAN YOU DRIVE ME HOME?"

03:49.294 --> 03:50.861
AND WE GET ON
WITH OUR LIVES.

03:50.929 --> 03:53.097
I'VE DONE THAT?

03:53.164 --> 03:55.366
COUPLE OF TIMES.

03:58.303 --> 03:59.937
YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
MY DOG IS SO UPSET

04:00.005 --> 04:02.574
THAT HOLLY'S NOT GONNA
BE WALKING HIM ANYMORE,

04:02.641 --> 04:05.009
LAST NIGHT, HE PEED
IN MY SLIPPERS.

04:05.077 --> 04:07.779
ACTUALLY, THAT WAS ME.

04:07.847 --> 04:10.181
DON'T LEAVE 'EM
NEXT TO THE TOILET.

04:10.248 --> 04:11.982
YOU KNOW I BREAK RIGHT.

04:13.251 --> 04:13.984
AT LEAST YOU'RE CONSISTENT.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.387
ARTHUR'S LIKE
A GOLF COURSE SPRINKLER.

04:22.528 --> 04:25.129
HEY, YO.
CHECK OUT THE MENU.

04:25.197 --> 04:26.730
DON'T TELL ME THEY'RE
BRINGING BACK THE TOFU FINGERS

04:26.798 --> 04:28.899
'CAUSE I SWEAR TO GOD,
I WILL WALK.

04:28.967 --> 04:31.068
NO, MAN. THEY NAMED
A SANDWICH AFTER ME.

04:31.136 --> 04:32.136
WHAT?

04:32.203 --> 04:34.839
"THE DEACON."
THAT IS SO COOL!

04:34.907 --> 04:36.707
LET ME SEE THAT.

04:36.775 --> 04:37.575
I GUESS PADDY THOUGHT THAT COMBO
I CAME UP WITH THE OTHER NIGHT

04:37.710 --> 04:39.878
WAS GOOD ENOUGH
TO BECOME A MENU ITEM.

04:39.945 --> 04:41.112
YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.
THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM.

04:41.180 --> 04:42.980
IT'S MY SANDWICH.

04:43.048 --> 04:43.981
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

04:44.049 --> 04:44.782
I'M THE ONE
WHO CAME UP WITH THE IDEA

04:44.917 --> 04:45.917
TO MAKE A CLUB SANDWICH

04:45.984 --> 04:48.586
WITH HAM, PASTRAMI,
ONION RINGS AND GRAVY.

04:48.654 --> 04:51.055
BUT I GOT RID OF THE HAM
AND REPLACED THE GRAVY

04:51.122 --> 04:52.790
WITH A DAB OF HORSERADISH.

04:52.858 --> 04:54.859
YEAH, BUT I INVENTED IT.

04:54.960 --> 04:57.294
SEE, FOOD TO YOU,
IT'S JUST FUEL.

04:57.362 --> 05:01.632
TO ME,
IT'S AN UNEXPLORED COUNTRY.

05:01.700 --> 05:02.500
YOU SHOULD COME BACK

05:02.635 --> 05:05.469
'CAUSE THAT COUNTRY'S
OUT OF BACON.

05:05.537 --> 05:07.772
BY THE WAY, I CAN GET YOUR
SANDWICH AT ANY BENNIGAN'S.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.874
GUYS, WE'RE ALL FRIENDS
HERE, ALL RIGHT?

05:11.776 --> 05:13.377
TELL YOU WHAT,
LET'S TAKE A SURVEY.

05:13.445 --> 05:15.346
SPENCE, WHOSE SANDWICH
DO YOU THINK IT IS?

05:19.117 --> 05:21.619
PLEASE DON'T PUT ME
IN THE MIDDLE.

05:21.687 --> 05:24.221
THIS IS JUST LIKE
WHEN MY DAD LEFT.

05:24.289 --> 05:25.623
WHATEVER, OK?

05:25.691 --> 05:27.292
A REAL FRIEND WOULD MAKE
THIS MENU THING RIGHT,

05:27.359 --> 05:28.392
AND I GUESS YOU'RE
NOT A REAL FRIEND.

05:28.460 --> 05:29.694
YOU KNOW, SHAME ON YOU.

05:29.761 --> 05:31.128
WHY ARE YOU BEING
SUCH A BABY ABOUT THIS?

05:31.196 --> 05:32.563
YOU'RE A BABY 'CAUSE
BABIES ARE ALWAYS GRABBING

05:32.631 --> 05:35.066
WHAT'S NOT THEIRS.
THAT'S CLASSIC BABY!

05:35.134 --> 05:37.869
SO YOU GUYS
READY TO ORDER?

05:37.936 --> 05:41.238
YEAH, YEAH,
I'LL HAVE A "ME."

05:41.306 --> 05:42.406
ONE DEACON.

05:42.474 --> 05:44.542
MAKE IT TWO.

05:46.811 --> 05:49.280
MAKE IT THREE.

05:49.348 --> 05:51.416
WATCH YOUR BACK,
LITTLE MAN.

05:52.751 --> 05:56.554
THREE DEACONS.
AND FOR YOU?

05:56.622 --> 05:58.389
YOU KNOW WHAT,

05:58.456 --> 06:00.357
I SEEM TO HAVE
LOST MY APPETITE.

06:00.425 --> 06:03.561
I'LL JUST HAVE A BURGER,
OK, WITH CURLY FRIES.

06:03.629 --> 06:04.996
DON'T DO THE STEAK FRIES,
LAST TIME THEY-

06:05.063 --> 06:07.264
JUST BRING THE CURLY FRIES.

06:07.332 --> 06:12.136
EXCUSE ME, DID I JUST HEAR
YOU CREATED THE DEACON?

06:12.204 --> 06:14.471
YES.
YES, I DID.

06:14.539 --> 06:17.174
I JUST HAD ONE.
I LOVED IT!

06:17.242 --> 06:18.809
THANKS, MAN.

06:18.877 --> 06:21.579
HATE TO IMPOSE,
BUT WOULD YOU SIGN MY MENU?

06:21.646 --> 06:23.114
OH, SURE.

06:23.182 --> 06:26.184
COULD YOU MAKE IT
OUT TO ROGER?

06:26.251 --> 06:27.985
THANKS SO MUCH.

06:28.053 --> 06:33.257
"TO ROGER,
KEEP ON DREAMIN'."

06:33.325 --> 06:36.161
THAT'S ORIGINAL.

06:36.228 --> 06:37.394
"DEACON PALMER."

06:45.804 --> 06:47.505
I TALKED WITH CARL.

06:47.572 --> 06:50.074
OH, BABY,
I'M SORRY.

06:50.141 --> 06:51.308
IT'S BETTER YOU FIND OUT NOW, THOUGH.

06:51.376 --> 06:53.611
WE'RE ENGAGED!

06:53.679 --> 06:54.612
WHAT?!

06:54.680 --> 06:55.813
WELL, I DID
WHAT YOU SAID.

06:55.881 --> 06:57.414
I TOLD HIM I NEEDED TO KNOW
IF HE WAS SERIOUS,

06:57.483 --> 06:58.616
AND, BOOM,

06:58.684 --> 06:59.650
RIGHT THEN AND THERE,
HE PROPOSED.

06:59.718 --> 07:01.351
AND LOOK WHAT
HE BOUGHT ME!

07:01.419 --> 07:03.353
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

07:03.421 --> 07:07.157
HOLLY, HOLLY...

07:07.225 --> 07:09.159
WHEN DO WE LEARN?

07:09.227 --> 07:11.429
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

07:11.496 --> 07:13.097
IT WAS TOO EASY.

07:13.164 --> 07:15.299
YOU SAY ONE WORD,
AND THE GUY PROPOSES,

07:15.401 --> 07:16.333
AND HE JUST
HAPPENS TO HAVE

07:16.402 --> 07:19.169
A BIG, DIAMOND RING
TO GIVE YOU?

07:19.237 --> 07:21.005
YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S REAL?

07:21.073 --> 07:24.374
BABY, IT'S COMICALLY BIG.

07:24.442 --> 07:27.011
BUT CARL SAID-

07:27.079 --> 07:29.547
CARL'S GONNA SAY WHAT
YOU WANT TO HEAR, KITTY KAT.

07:29.614 --> 07:31.782
YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH
ABOUT YOUR LITTLE RING,

07:31.850 --> 07:33.717
YOU GO TO A PROFESSIONAL.

07:33.785 --> 07:35.419
IT'S FLAWLESS!

07:35.487 --> 07:36.855
REALLY?

07:36.922 --> 07:38.156
REALLY?!

07:38.224 --> 07:40.691
SIMPLY STUNNING.

07:40.759 --> 07:42.627
MOST DIAMONDS HAVE
A YELLOW TINGE,

07:42.694 --> 07:46.297
SMALL INCLUSIONS,
AND TINY BLACK SPOTS.

07:49.301 --> 07:51.235
BUT THIS?
SUPERB!

07:51.303 --> 07:54.405
AND THE CUT, SEE HOW
IT DANCES IN THE LIGHT?

07:54.473 --> 07:56.040
OK, SETTLE DOWN, YOU.

07:56.107 --> 07:57.875
HESH!
HESHY, COME LOOK AT THIS!

07:57.943 --> 07:59.310
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I GUESS WE CAN GO NOW.

07:59.377 --> 08:00.912
HESHY HASN'T SEE IT YET.

08:02.915 --> 08:05.149
I'M JUST SAYING CAN'T
WE CALL THIS "THE DOUG"?

08:05.216 --> 08:08.585
IT ALREADY HAS A NAME.
IT'S A TACO.

08:08.653 --> 08:11.289
NO, IT'S TACO TOPPED WITH RELISH
AND CRUMBLED UP SALTINES.

08:11.357 --> 08:12.356
HMM?

08:12.424 --> 08:13.624
COME ON, MAN,
I GOT CUSTOMERS.

08:13.692 --> 08:14.826
HOW ABOUT THIS, OK?

08:14.893 --> 08:16.761
YOU CHANGE HOT DOG
INTO A "HOT DOUG"?

08:16.829 --> 08:18.663
YOU JUST GRAB
THE "U" FROM SOUP.

08:18.730 --> 08:20.297
NO ONE'S ORDERING THAT ANYWAY,
I GOT TO TELL YOU.

08:20.365 --> 08:21.132
WHO'S NEXT?

08:21.200 --> 08:22.266
DO NOT IGNORE ME, MANNY!

08:22.334 --> 08:25.369
I BUILT THIS ROACH COACH,
AND I CAN TAKE HER DOWN.

08:25.437 --> 08:27.104
HEY! DID YOU PUT ME
ON THE SIGN-UP SHEET

08:27.206 --> 08:28.539
TO WORK SATURDAY?

08:28.606 --> 08:30.474
WELL, I KNOW YOU LIKE TO PUT
YOUR NAME ON EVERYTHING,

08:30.542 --> 08:32.043
SO I DID YOU A FAVOR.

08:32.110 --> 08:33.910
YOU KNOW IT'S MY KID'S
TENTH BIRTHDAY.

08:33.979 --> 08:37.047
GOOD, THEN HE'S OLD ENOUGH TO
KNOW HIS DAD'S A GLORY HOUND.

08:37.115 --> 08:38.782
YOU'RE PATHETIC.
I'M PATHETIC?

08:38.850 --> 08:40.751
MANNY'S NAMING AN EGG SALAD
SANDWICH AFTER ME.

08:40.818 --> 08:43.486
PLAY BALL WITH ME,
DAMN IT.

08:53.164 --> 08:54.465
SO WHAT YOU'RE
TELLING ME, PETER,

08:54.532 --> 08:56.567
IS THAT YOU'LL WALK ME
FOR $1.00 LESS

08:56.635 --> 08:58.936
THAN WHAT
MY PREVIOUS WALKER CHARGED,

08:59.004 --> 09:04.375
PLUS COMPLIMENTARY
SUNSCREEN?

09:04.443 --> 09:05.476
HEY, ARTHUR.

09:05.544 --> 09:07.010
OOH, HOW AWKWARD!

09:07.078 --> 09:13.284
I WAS JUST INTERVIEWING
YOUR POTENTIAL REPLACEMENT.

09:13.352 --> 09:14.685
OH, GREAT.
GREAT.

09:14.753 --> 09:16.020
I JUST STOPPED BY TO
INVITE YOU TO MY THING

09:16.088 --> 09:17.955
I'M HAVING TOMORROW

09:18.023 --> 09:19.023
OH, YES,
YOUR ELABORATE RUSE.

09:19.091 --> 09:21.325
I MEAN,
YOUR GOING-AWAY PARTY.

09:21.393 --> 09:23.127
YES, YES, I'LL BE THERE.

09:23.195 --> 09:24.795
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
PETER WANTED TO HEAR

09:24.863 --> 09:27.865
ALL ABOUT MY DECADES-LONG
PEN-PAL RELATIONSHIP

09:27.933 --> 09:31.369
WITH MR. NEIL SEDAKA.

09:31.437 --> 09:32.603
HOLLY, IS THAT YOU?

09:32.671 --> 09:33.704
YEAH.

09:33.772 --> 09:36.074
I'M IN HERE.
I JUST GOOGLED YOUR BOYFRIEND!

09:38.810 --> 09:39.910
CAN I LEAVE NOW?
NOT YET!

09:39.978 --> 09:41.478
OK.

09:41.546 --> 09:43.747
SEE, I PUT IN CARL'S
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER

09:43.815 --> 09:45.683
AND HIS WHOLE LIFE,
RIGHT HERE.

09:45.750 --> 09:48.152
HOW DID YOU GET
HIS SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER?

09:48.220 --> 09:50.421
EXCUSE ME, WHO'S ON
TRIAL HERE, HIM OR ME?

09:50.488 --> 09:53.557
SO WHAT DID

09:53.625 --> 09:57.095
WELL, TAKE
A LITTLE LOOK-SEE.

09:57.162 --> 09:59.097
AND IT AIN'T PRETTY.

10:03.369 --> 10:06.971
ALL IT SAYS HERE IS THAT HE'S GOT A
COUPLE OF OUTSTANDING PARKING TICKETS.

10:07.039 --> 10:08.606
YEAH, EXACTLY, HOLLY.

10:08.673 --> 10:12.443
THE GUY THINKS HE CAN PARK
HIS CAR ANYWHERE HE WANTS.

10:12.511 --> 10:14.612
WHAT ELSE IS HE PARKING
ANYWHERE HE WANTS?

10:14.679 --> 10:16.280
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M SAYING?

10:16.347 --> 10:18.716
WELL, DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
THAT DOUG GETS A LOT OF TICKETS?

10:18.783 --> 10:21.619
YES, BUT HE'S
JUST AN IDIOT.

10:21.687 --> 10:26.290
OK, WELL, YEAH,
THANKS FOR CHECKING.

10:26.358 --> 10:28.025
AGAIN, JUST MAKING SURE
YOU DON'T GET HURT.

10:28.093 --> 10:30.127
YEAH, AGAIN, THANKS.

10:30.195 --> 10:31.895
OH, DO YOU KNOW CARL'S
MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME?

10:31.964 --> 10:32.896
NO.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.766
IT'S OK, BABY.
I'LL GET IT.

10:45.543 --> 10:47.077
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

10:47.145 --> 10:48.446
YOU WORK
FOR A LAWYER, RIGHT?

10:48.513 --> 10:50.314
I USED TO WORK
FOR A LAWYER,

10:50.381 --> 10:51.182
BUT FOR THE LAST
YEAR AND A HALF,

10:51.250 --> 10:53.150
I'VE WORKED
FOR A REAL ESTATE FIRM.

10:53.218 --> 10:54.885
CLOSE ENOUGH.

10:54.953 --> 10:57.888
I WANT TO FILE A LAWSUIT
OR AN INJUNCTION.

10:57.956 --> 11:00.024
I'LL LET YOU HANDLE
THE MUMBO-JUMBO.

11:00.091 --> 11:03.560
THE POINT IS,
I WANT DEACON BEHIND BARS.

11:03.628 --> 11:05.329
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

11:05.396 --> 11:06.897
I INVENTED A SANDWICH, AND
HE'S TAKING CREDIT FOR IT.

11:06.965 --> 11:09.166
AND WHERE I COME FROM,
THAT AIN'T RIGHT!

11:10.702 --> 11:12.303
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
AIN'T RIGHT?

11:12.370 --> 11:16.006
THIS CRAPPY-ASS RING
YOU GOT ME.

11:17.275 --> 11:19.243
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

11:19.310 --> 11:21.912
IS IT FLAWLESS?
DOES IT DANCE IN THE LIGHT?

11:21.980 --> 11:23.614
DOES IT?!
DOES IT?!

11:23.682 --> 11:24.848
A LITTLE.

11:24.916 --> 11:25.916
YOU MOVE IT AROUND
KIND OF QUICK THERE.

11:25.984 --> 11:28.218
IT'S FINE.
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

11:28.286 --> 11:30.421
I DON'T KNOW.
HOLLY MET THIS GREAT GUY

11:30.489 --> 11:32.557
WHO BOUGHT HER
THIS BIG, DIAMOND RING,

11:32.624 --> 11:35.326
AND NOW THEY'RE MOVING TO SOME
FANCY APARTMENT IN MANHATTAN

11:35.394 --> 11:38.529
THAT OVERLOOKS THE PARK,
AND, I DON'T KNOW, IT'S-

11:38.597 --> 11:40.531
IT'S EVERYTHING
I ALWAYS WANTED.

11:40.599 --> 11:42.799
YOU'RE MAD AT ME 'CAUSE
I CAN'T GIVE IT TO YOU.

11:42.867 --> 11:45.169
NO, I MADE PEACE WITH...

11:49.040 --> 11:51.675
ALL RIGHT, COOL.

11:51.743 --> 11:53.810
I GUESS I'M UPSET
'CAUSE IT'S LIKE

11:53.879 --> 11:57.081
WHO IS SHE TO BE LIVING
MY DREAM, YOU KNOW?

11:57.148 --> 11:58.649
EXACTLY. AND WHO'S DEACON
TO BE LIVING MY DREAM?

11:58.717 --> 12:00.250
IT'S THE SAME THING!

12:00.318 --> 12:04.522
EXCUSE ME, MY DREAM IS TO
HAVE A DECENT QUALITY OF LIFE,

12:04.590 --> 12:06.857
YOUR DREAM IS
TO BE A SANDWICH.

12:08.393 --> 12:10.027
YEAH.

12:10.095 --> 12:11.562
DOUG, THE POINT-
YOU KNOW WHAT,

12:11.629 --> 12:13.630
I DON'T EVEN HAVE THE ENERGY
TO ARGUE WITH YOU.

12:13.698 --> 12:15.799
JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT
TO WEAR TO HOLLY'S PARTY.

12:15.867 --> 12:17.067
I'LL MAKE SURE
IT'S CLEAN.

12:17.135 --> 12:18.335
OH, I'M NOT GOING
TO ANY PARTY

12:18.470 --> 12:20.604
WHERE THAT MAN
IS GOING TO BE.

12:20.672 --> 12:22.539
DOUG, LOOK,
LET'S JUST AGREE

12:22.607 --> 12:25.109
WE BOTH GOT A RAW DEAL HERE,
ALL RIGHT?

12:25.177 --> 12:26.944
BUT DEACON AND HOLLY,
THEY'RE OUR FRIENDS.

12:27.012 --> 12:30.081
WE NEED TO GO TO THE PARTY
AND BE HAPPY FOR THEM, OK?

12:35.387 --> 12:40.758
LOOK AT 'EM.
"OH, WE'RE SO IN LOVE."

12:40.826 --> 12:43.927
I NEED A BUCKET.

12:43.995 --> 12:45.463
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO BE
HAPPY FOR OUR FRIENDS.

12:45.530 --> 12:46.464
OH, RIGHT.

12:46.531 --> 12:48.932
LIKE YOU'RE HAPPY
FOR DEACON?

12:49.000 --> 12:50.434
THE MAN STOLE THE ONE THING IN YOUR LIFE

12:50.502 --> 12:53.770
YOU HAD GOING
FOR YOU.

12:53.838 --> 12:56.573
OH, HEY, CARRIE.
GREAT PARTY, HUH?

12:56.641 --> 12:58.242
YEP.

12:58.310 --> 13:01.011
YOU KNOW,
I NEVER TOLD YOU THIS,

13:01.079 --> 13:02.813
BUT I ALWAYS KIND OF
HAD A THING FOR HOLLY.

13:02.881 --> 13:04.915
I MEAN, I'M GLAD
SHE MET CARL.

13:04.983 --> 13:07.117
HE SEEMS LIKE
A REALLY GREAT GUY AND-

13:07.185 --> 13:09.854
OH, GROW SOME NUGGETS,
WILL YA?

13:09.921 --> 13:11.055
WHAT?

13:11.123 --> 13:13.057
HOW MANY TIMES DID
THE GIRL STUMBLE

13:13.125 --> 13:14.659
TO YOUR DOORSTEP,
BLIND DRUNK,

13:14.726 --> 13:16.293
AFTER WALKING THAT UGLY,
LITTLE DOG OF YOURS,

13:16.361 --> 13:18.863
AND YOU STILL COULDN'T
CLOSE THE DEAL?

13:18.930 --> 13:20.698
YOU MAKE ME SICK.

13:22.934 --> 13:25.169
DINNER IS SERVED, Y'ALL.

13:29.741 --> 13:30.841
WHAT IS THAT?

13:30.909 --> 13:32.643
A 6-FOOT DEACON.
YOU WANT A PIECE?

13:32.711 --> 13:34.077
OH, NO, THANK YOU.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.646
MAYBE IF IT HAD LIKE
BROWN GRAVY ON IT

13:35.713 --> 13:37.414
INSTEAD OF HORSERADISH.

13:37.482 --> 13:39.150
WOULDN'T THAT MAKE IT
KIND OF SOGGY?

13:39.218 --> 13:41.852
YOU'RE SOGGY.

13:41.920 --> 13:42.853
WHAT?

13:42.921 --> 13:44.221
WALK AWAY.

13:46.591 --> 13:47.991
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

13:48.059 --> 13:48.992
THANKS.

13:49.060 --> 13:50.294
JUST ONE NOTE:

13:50.362 --> 13:53.064
NEXT TIME YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET
A MORE CONVINCING ACTOR

13:53.131 --> 13:55.332
TO PLAY THE PART
OF YOUR FIANCÉ.

13:55.400 --> 13:59.436
THIS GUY BELONGS ON A BAGEL
BECAUSE HE'S A LOX.

13:59.504 --> 14:01.539
SO, I BET
THE LIMOUSINE BUSINESS

14:01.606 --> 14:03.774
HAS BEEN VERY GOOD
TO YOU, HUH?

14:03.842 --> 14:06.977
WELL, IT'S A LOT OF WORK,
BUT I LOVE IT.

14:07.045 --> 14:08.712
I BET YOU DO.

14:08.780 --> 14:11.048
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14:11.116 --> 14:14.317
COME ON, IT'S ME.
IT'S LATE AT NIGHT,

14:14.385 --> 14:17.455
YOU'RE DRIVING SOME COKED-UP
SUPERMODEL TO THE AIRPORT,

14:17.522 --> 14:19.356
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE'S
IN THE FRONT SEAT WITH YOU.

14:19.423 --> 14:22.659
"OH, YOU OWN THE COMPANY?
THAT'S SO HOT."

14:22.727 --> 14:24.662
UM, CARRIE,

14:24.729 --> 14:26.330
CAN I TALK TO YOU
IN PRIVATE FOR A SECOND?

14:26.398 --> 14:28.299
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
BE RIGHT BACK.

14:33.338 --> 14:35.038
OHH!

14:37.742 --> 14:39.643
GUY, YOU OK?

14:39.711 --> 14:44.715
I TELL YA, THIS DEACON
OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT,

14:44.782 --> 14:47.551
IT'S SO DRY,
I CAN'T EVEN SWALLOW IT.

14:51.656 --> 14:54.358
I NEED SOMETHING
TO MAKE IT MORE MOIST,

14:54.426 --> 14:57.060
YET NOT SOGGY.

14:57.128 --> 14:58.062
HOW ABOUT SOME WATER?

14:58.129 --> 15:00.364
NO, THAT'S NOT GONNA
DO ANYTHING FOR ME.

15:00.432 --> 15:02.832
I NEED SOMETHING SMOOTH
LIKE GRAVY

15:02.900 --> 15:03.934
OR SOMETHING LIKE-

15:06.804 --> 15:10.107
OH, YEAH.

15:10.175 --> 15:12.242
NOW THAT'S A SANDWICH.

15:12.310 --> 15:14.477
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'VE
HAD ENOUGH OF YOUR CRAP.

15:14.545 --> 15:15.679
WELL, I'VE HAD
ENOUGH OF YOURS.

15:15.747 --> 15:16.746
YOU WANNA GO?

15:16.814 --> 15:17.515
I WOULD LOVE TO GO!

15:17.582 --> 15:19.382
THEN LET'S GO!
I'M GOING!

15:19.450 --> 15:21.585
COME ON!

15:21.652 --> 15:23.520
YEAH, I JUST REALLY
WANT TO KNOW

15:23.588 --> 15:26.056
WHY YOU WERE
GROPING MY FIANCÉ?

15:26.124 --> 15:28.325
I WAS TESTING HIM.

15:28.393 --> 15:29.659
AND KEEP UP
WITH THE ATTITUDE,

15:29.727 --> 15:31.395
I'M GONNA STOP
HELPING YOU.

15:31.463 --> 15:33.597
HELPING ME?
YOU'RE TRYING TO RUIN IT.

15:33.665 --> 15:36.200
RUIN IT? WHY WOULD
I WANT TO RUIN IT?

15:36.268 --> 15:37.601
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE 'CAUSE YOU'RE MAD

15:37.669 --> 15:40.337
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I FOUND A REALLY GREAT GUY.

15:40.404 --> 15:43.106
EXCUSE ME, I HAVE
A REALLY GREAT GUY, TOO.

15:55.520 --> 15:57.254
LOOK, DID YOU
EVER HAVE A FRIEND

15:57.322 --> 15:58.955
WHOSE LIFE SUCKED SO BAD

15:59.023 --> 16:01.492
THAT IT MADE YOU FEEL
BETTER ABOUT YOUR OWN?

16:01.559 --> 16:03.394
WHAT? NO.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.763
WELL, I DID,
AND IT WAS YOU.

16:06.831 --> 16:09.567
OH!

16:09.634 --> 16:12.869
OH, I'M SO SORRY THINGS
WORKED OUT FOR ME. THAT'S OK.

16:12.937 --> 16:15.605
OH, SWEETIE, I'M SORRY.
THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING.

16:15.673 --> 16:17.875
YOU'RE WELCOME. YOU'RE
WELCOME. THANK YOU.

16:17.942 --> 16:19.977
THE CAR'S HERE.
WE SHOULD SKEDADDLE.

16:20.044 --> 16:22.980
OK, I'LL BE THERE
IN A SECOND, HONEY.

16:23.047 --> 16:25.649
"SKEDADDLE"?

16:25.717 --> 16:28.085
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
MY GAYDAR JUST WENT

16:28.153 --> 16:30.754
BOOP, BOOP, BOOP.

16:33.624 --> 16:35.459
GOOD LUCK, SWEETIE.

16:35.527 --> 16:36.827
THANKS.

16:39.464 --> 16:40.764
GOOD-BYE.
BYE.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.669
ANOTHER GIN AND TONIC.

16:48.840 --> 16:51.642
SO YOUR LIFE MUST BE
PRETTY CRAPPY, HUH?

16:57.849 --> 17:00.250
ALL RIGHT, YOU WIN.

17:00.318 --> 17:01.918
I'LL CONVINCE DOUGLAS
AND CARRIE TO GIVE YOU

17:01.986 --> 17:03.854
$1.00 MORE AN HOUR.
ARTHUR-

17:03.921 --> 17:06.189
I'LL EXPECT YOU TO KICK A
QUARTER OF THAT BACK TO ME.

17:06.257 --> 17:09.160
WOULD YOU STOP IT? WHY CAN'T YOU
GET THIS THROUGH YOUR CRAZY HEAD?

17:09.227 --> 17:11.295
I'M LEAVING.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.195
REALLY?
YES.

17:13.263 --> 17:16.400
AND THIS IS
HOW I FIND OUT?

17:16.467 --> 17:17.667
SORRY.

17:19.569 --> 17:22.973
YOU WERE THE BEST DOG WALKER
A MAN COULD EVER ASK FOR.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.474
THANK YOU, ARTHUR.
AND OF ALL MY CLIENTS,

17:25.542 --> 17:27.810
YOU WERE DEFINITELY
THE MOST INTERESTING

17:27.878 --> 17:31.048
AND THE LEAST DISTRACTED
BY SQUIRRELS.

17:31.116 --> 17:33.016
YOU'RE A TERRIBLE LIAR,

17:33.084 --> 17:35.319
BUT A MARVELOUS PERSON.

17:35.386 --> 17:39.323
YOU KNOW,
CARL'S STILL INSIDE.

17:39.390 --> 17:41.124
I HAVE TIME
FOR ONE MORE WALK.

17:41.192 --> 17:42.292
ON THE HOUSE.

17:42.360 --> 17:43.660
I'D LIKE THAT.

17:46.030 --> 17:48.298
WHAT SAY I TREAT YOU
TO A LEMON ICE AT LUIGI'S?

17:48.366 --> 17:49.366
THAT'D BE GREAT.

17:49.434 --> 17:50.434
BY THE WAY,
DID I EVER TELL YOU

17:50.501 --> 17:53.103
HOW I INSPIRED
NEIL SEDAKA'S POP CLASSIC,

17:53.170 --> 17:54.638
<i>HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
SWEET SIXTEEN?</i>

17:54.706 --> 17:57.340
YES, BUT I WOULD LOVE
TO HEAR IT AGAIN.

17:58.476 --> 18:01.779
COME ON, GRAVY BOAT!
WHATCHA GOT, HUH?

18:01.846 --> 18:03.347
GUYS, GUYS, GUYS,

18:03.414 --> 18:04.882
GUYS, I TALKED TO PADDY,

18:04.949 --> 18:06.784
AND HE AGREED
ON A COMPROMISE, OK?

18:06.851 --> 18:08.551
HE SAID HE WOULD
PUT BACK THE HAM

18:08.619 --> 18:10.654
AND HE WOULD USE
HORSERADISH AND GRAVY,

18:10.721 --> 18:14.024
AND HE WOULD CALL IT
"THE DEACON/DOUG."

18:14.092 --> 18:15.725
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

18:15.793 --> 18:17.294
WHY IS HIS NAME FIRST?
WHY IS HIS NAME FIRST?

18:17.361 --> 18:19.363
OK, WE'LL CALL IT
"THE DOUBLE D"

18:19.430 --> 18:21.498
AND EVERYBODY'S HAPPY.

18:32.377 --> 18:34.711
5 MINUTES, MR. SEDAKA.

18:34.779 --> 18:36.680
THANK YOU.

18:36.747 --> 18:38.248
"SO I LOST HOLLY,

18:38.316 --> 18:41.585
"AND PETER'S MOTHER HAS
FORBIDDEN ME FROM CONTACT.

18:41.652 --> 18:44.988
"ON THE PLUS SIDE,
THE FIBER 4,000 CONTINUES

18:45.056 --> 18:48.792
"TO DO A STERLING JOB
ON MY NETHER REGIONS.

18:48.859 --> 18:50.427
THANKS FOR THE TIP."
