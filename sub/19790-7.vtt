(sighs)

00:09.670 --> 00:11.290
Your cocktail, miss?

00:11.290 --> 00:13.040
Mahalo, my homegirl.

00:14.460 --> 00:15.710
Well, all right.

00:15.710 --> 00:19.040
Now all we need is
an island breeze...

00:19.040 --> 00:22.960
-Mm.

island music...

00:22.960 --> 00:26.080

music playing)

Both:
Staycation!

00:30.540 --> 00:32.580
You know,
if you close your eyes,

00:32.580 --> 00:34.460
you can almost hear the waves

Hey!

00:39.790 --> 00:41.540
Shut the hell up!
We're in Maui!

00:42.670 --> 00:44.120
I'll get us earplugs.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.790
At least we can
still lay out in the sun.

00:45.790 --> 00:48.170
(thunder rumbling)

00:48.170 --> 00:50.460
Ugh, garbage trucks
and rain!

00:50.460 --> 00:52.250
Now we have to drink
inside on the couch!

00:52.250 --> 00:54.380
That's not a vacation,
we do that everyday.

00:55.790 --> 00:58.170
Why can't we afford to go
on a real fancy vacation?

00:58.170 --> 01:00.040
No one our age can.

01:00.040 --> 01:02.290
We're only 24.
Who's got that kind of money?

01:02.290 --> 01:04.250
(cell phones chime)

01:04.250 --> 01:05.920
Ugh, Lizette.

01:05.920 --> 01:07.080
Lizette?

01:07.080 --> 01:08.420
Both:
Lizette.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.920
Can you believe this
Facebook post?

01:11.920 --> 01:14.120
"So excited to marry
my best friend

01:14.120 --> 01:17.000
at our destination
wedding in Punta Cana!"

01:17.000 --> 01:18.540
I want to go
to Punta Cana!

01:19.790 --> 01:21.790
Where's Punta Cana?

01:21.790 --> 01:23.330
Dominican Republic.

01:23.330 --> 01:25.500
She's flying down
in a private jet

01:25.500 --> 01:27.500
and staying at
a beachfront villa!

01:27.500 --> 01:28.920
She makes me sick.

01:28.920 --> 01:31.210
She's the worst.

01:31.210 --> 01:33.670
We should try to get
in touch with her again.

01:33.670 --> 01:34.710
Why?

01:34.710 --> 01:36.920
Uh, hello, we get
friendly with her,

01:36.920 --> 01:38.960
she invites us
to the wedding,

01:38.960 --> 01:40.960
and then we go
to Punta Cana for free!

01:40.960 --> 01:43.080
How? We'd still have to pay
our own way. It says:

01:43.080 --> 01:46.250
"The private jet and villa are
only for the wedding party."

01:46.250 --> 01:47.500
Aw, man.

01:49.040 --> 01:51.080
That's it.
The wedding party.

Lizette's life turned out?

Who knew she'd
make so much money

02:18.710 --> 02:20.290
off of Da Bomb Lip Balm?

02:20.290 --> 02:21.830
Ugh, yeah...

02:21.830 --> 02:23.290
People are sheep.

Gabi! Sofia!

02:33.170 --> 02:35.000
We have so much
to catch up on.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.080
Wait. Was I a millionaire

02:37.080 --> 02:38.380
the last time
we saw each other?

02:38.380 --> 02:39.420
Yep.

02:39.420 --> 02:40.790
Well, now I'm a multi one.

02:40.790 --> 02:41.830
(laughing)

02:41.830 --> 02:44.710
God, Lizette. Your life
turned out so amazing.

02:44.710 --> 02:46.960
Yeah, but there
is a downside.

02:46.960 --> 02:49.750
I mean, my hand is cramping up

02:49.750 --> 02:50.960
lugging this thing around!

02:50.960 --> 02:52.830
-Oh!
-Ah!

02:52.830 --> 02:53.880
(laughs)

02:53.880 --> 02:55.330
One dirty martini.

02:55.330 --> 02:57.500
I always wondered
what made it dirty.

02:57.500 --> 02:58.540
Mm. This.

02:58.540 --> 03:00.080
(sputtering)

03:02.000 --> 03:03.580
(growls)

03:03.580 --> 03:05.380
So... I'm guessing,

03:05.380 --> 03:07.330
you have more of an...
open engagement?

03:07.330 --> 03:10.000
Oh, that's my fiancé... Carlo.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.380
That's why
I wanted to meet here.

03:11.380 --> 03:12.920
He's Filipino.

03:12.920 --> 03:14.750
I met him when he catered
one of my openings.

03:14.750 --> 03:17.210
And now, he caters
all my openings.

03:17.210 --> 03:19.120
Oh... Oh!

03:20.170 --> 03:22.040
I know it's crazy, right?

03:22.040 --> 03:23.120
So...

03:23.120 --> 03:25.290
you two gay marry
each other yet?

03:25.290 --> 03:27.790
'Cause that was the rumor
in high school.

03:28.920 --> 03:29.960
Uh...

03:29.960 --> 03:31.170
Lizette,

03:31.170 --> 03:32.750
if we married each other,

03:32.750 --> 03:36.750
don't you think we would ask
you to be our bridesmaid?

03:36.750 --> 03:37.790
Nope.

03:37.790 --> 03:38.830
Damn it.

03:38.830 --> 03:40.420
You know what's
crazy, Lizette?

03:40.420 --> 03:43.040
That you didn't ask us
to be your bridesmaids.

03:43.040 --> 03:45.040
Why the hell
would I do that?

03:45.040 --> 03:46.920
Well, because all of our lives,

03:46.920 --> 03:48.040
you've shoved
every great thing

03:48.040 --> 03:49.880
that ever happened
to you in our faces.

03:49.880 --> 03:52.460
That's not true.
Oh, did I tell you,

03:52.460 --> 03:54.420
I just bought
a WNBA team?

03:54.420 --> 03:56.000
Oh, mm-hmm,
now I see it.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.460
So, I mean,
how great would it be

03:59.460 --> 04:01.830
to be standing in your
gazillion-dollar wedding dress,

04:01.830 --> 04:03.620
under your
gazillion-dollar gazebo,

04:03.620 --> 04:05.790
watching us die of jealousy
because you have everything

04:05.790 --> 04:07.710
and we have gazilch?

04:07.710 --> 04:09.000
Hmm...

04:09.000 --> 04:10.540
That does sound fun.

04:10.540 --> 04:12.420
-You're in!
-(screams)

04:12.420 --> 04:14.880
Ooh, but there is
just one problem.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.000
There's only one
seat left on the jet.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.960
Who will I chose?

04:21.750 --> 04:22.790
(sighs)

04:22.790 --> 04:23.830
Sofia, you go.

04:23.830 --> 04:25.170
Oh, no, no, no, you go.

04:25.170 --> 04:27.250
-I can't go without you.
-Well, I can't go without you.

04:27.250 --> 04:30.210
And I can't believe you think
you're going to decide.

04:30.210 --> 04:31.880
It's my wedding.

04:31.880 --> 04:34.540
I'm gonna decide whose face
I shove it in.

04:34.540 --> 04:35.710
Speaking of shoving...

04:35.710 --> 04:36.710
Carlo!

04:36.710 --> 04:39.830
A round of dirty martinis
for my lesbian friends.

04:39.830 --> 04:42.710
(giggles)
Cheers, ladies!

04:46.670 --> 04:47.880
Yolanda, guess what?

04:47.880 --> 04:50.880
My college invited me
to give a guest lecture
on my profession.

04:50.880 --> 04:53.210
What's that?
Josh's bitch?

04:56.380 --> 04:57.710
His publicist!

04:57.710 --> 04:59.920
The person who
maintains his image,

04:59.920 --> 05:01.750
writes his
press releases,

05:01.750 --> 05:03.830
and manages any
crisis that pops up.

05:03.830 --> 05:05.830
Elliot, I have a crisis!

05:05.830 --> 05:07.330
And I shall manage it.

05:07.330 --> 05:09.040
I got some sauce
on my favorite hoodie.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.920
Need you to take it
to the dry cleaner, pronto.

05:13.250 --> 05:15.790
Damn... you are
critical to the team.

05:17.420 --> 05:18.750
That's not all
I do for him!

05:18.750 --> 05:21.040
Oh, I also need you to pick
me up a dozen donut holes.

05:21.040 --> 05:24.420
And I mean a dozen,
not ten with powdered
sugar on your tie.

05:24.420 --> 05:27.000
Oh, my God!

05:27.000 --> 05:28.790
I am Josh's bitch.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.710
How did this happen?

05:31.710 --> 05:34.750
It's because you let
him walk all over you.

05:34.750 --> 05:38.380
I laid the law down
with Josh on day one.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.670
I can't lay down the law.

05:40.670 --> 05:42.750
I'm not confident
and manly like you.

05:44.580 --> 05:46.080
Help me, Yolanda!

05:46.080 --> 05:48.330
Well, if you want Josh
to appreciate you,

05:48.330 --> 05:51.000
you gotta show him
you have other job prospects.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.080
Yes!

05:52.080 --> 05:53.750
Where would
I find those?

05:53.750 --> 05:56.880
Just give me your resumé
and I'll put it online for you.

05:56.880 --> 05:58.290
Oh, yeah!

05:58.290 --> 06:00.380
Then the offers
will start rolling in,

06:00.380 --> 06:03.420
and Josh will respect me,
and he'll see that I'm smart,

06:03.420 --> 06:06.040
ambitious and
I'm movin' on up.

06:06.040 --> 06:07.830
Thanks, Weezy.

06:13.790 --> 06:17.500
I gotta say,
you girls are sure
being civil to one another

06:17.500 --> 06:20.540
considering only one of you
can be my bridesmaid.

06:20.540 --> 06:23.790
Well, Gabi and I talked,
and we just want you
to be happy.

06:23.790 --> 06:25.750
And like you said,
the bride decides.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.170
Speaking
of wedding vows!

06:29.170 --> 06:31.790
Lizette, when I found out
you were getting married,

06:31.790 --> 06:35.040
I was just so caught up
in my joy for your joy

06:35.040 --> 06:38.330
that these wedding vows
just spilled out!

06:39.620 --> 06:40.750
What?

06:40.750 --> 06:43.290
I have been trying to write
my vows for three weeks,

06:43.290 --> 06:45.170
but nothing
rhymes with Filipino!

06:46.330 --> 06:49.710
"Carlo, from the moment we met,
you surprised me,

06:49.710 --> 06:52.620
captivated me,
and challenged
me like no other.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.460
I'm black,
you're Filipino,

06:54.460 --> 06:56.670
together we make
the perfect cappuccino."

06:58.170 --> 07:00.380
How did I miss
cappuccino?

07:00.380 --> 07:04.750
Sofia, can I talk to you
in the kitchen for a minute?

07:04.750 --> 07:06.210
There's ten
more stanzas.

07:07.580 --> 07:09.670
-What's up?
-What are you doing?

07:09.670 --> 07:12.120
Uh, well, at the bar,
you said that I should
be the one to go,

07:12.120 --> 07:14.000
so I'm just trying
to make sure that
I'm the one who goes.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.250
Well, at the bar,
you said I should go.

07:16.250 --> 07:17.750
I was being nice.

07:18.960 --> 07:21.500
This is the most manipulative
thing I have ever seen.

07:22.460 --> 07:24.750
Who wants
wedding cake?

07:24.750 --> 07:25.880
-What?
-Yep.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.960
Six different kinds
of cake tasting,
if you will.

07:28.960 --> 07:31.540
Ooh! Shut up!

07:31.540 --> 07:33.540
Is that mousseline
buttercream?

07:33.540 --> 07:35.210
You butter believe it!

07:35.210 --> 07:37.290
Mmm!

07:37.290 --> 07:40.380
This cake is so much
more delicious than
the cake I ordered.

07:40.380 --> 07:42.620
Gabi, will you be my--?

07:42.620 --> 07:44.580
-(phone chiming)
-Mm!

07:46.250 --> 07:47.460
Hello?

07:47.460 --> 07:49.210
Well, I think it's clear
we have a winner.

07:49.210 --> 07:50.620
Do we Gabi? Do we?

07:50.620 --> 07:53.080
Mm-hmm. Once you eat me,
you just can't beat me.

07:54.830 --> 07:57.460
It's the hotel!
They keep saying,
"No wedding! No wedding,"

07:57.460 --> 07:58.710
followed by
a bunch of Spanish!

07:58.710 --> 07:59.960
I only speak Mandarin!

07:59.960 --> 08:03.620
Aw. Well,
I speak Spanish.

08:03.620 --> 08:05.250
Hello?

08:05.250 --> 08:07.080
Okay, cual
es el problema?

08:07.080 --> 08:10.580
Señor, que necesitas para
que suceda esta boda?

08:10.580 --> 08:14.460
Okay, entonces van a tener
que resolver con Lil' So-so!

08:14.460 --> 08:16.080
Entiendes?

08:16.080 --> 08:18.040
Muchas gracias.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.540
Okay, so, the wedding
is back on.

08:20.540 --> 08:23.290
And they're throwing in
a free case of champagne!

08:23.290 --> 08:25.380
Oh! You saved
my wedding!

08:25.380 --> 08:28.170
But, but, but,
buttercream.

08:29.420 --> 08:32.210
Sofia... will you be
my bridesmaid?

08:32.210 --> 08:33.540
-Gabi: No!
-Sofia: Yes!

08:34.880 --> 08:37.000
Hasta la vista, loser.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.500
(huffs)

08:46.540 --> 08:48.460
Here's your coffee,

08:48.460 --> 08:49.790
and your eggs,

08:49.790 --> 08:50.880
and your toast!

08:50.880 --> 08:52.460
Butter or jelly?

08:53.460 --> 08:55.210
I'm just going to take
this knife away.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.790
(sighs)

08:58.790 --> 09:00.920
What's going on? I thought this
was your staycation with Sofia.

09:00.920 --> 09:03.670
Yeah, it was,
until she beat me out
to be a bridesmaid,

09:03.670 --> 09:05.830
and now she gets to go
to Punta Cana
and I'm stuck here.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.380
Wait a minute.

09:09.380 --> 09:12.120
Sofia won...
and you lost?

09:13.670 --> 09:14.790
That's a first.

09:14.790 --> 09:18.540
Yeah, only because somehow
she speaks Punta Can-ese.

09:18.540 --> 09:21.290
Or I just give you the money
to go to Punta Cana.

09:21.290 --> 09:22.710
(gasps)
Really?

09:22.710 --> 09:24.120
No, no, no, no.

09:24.120 --> 09:25.500
We're having
punch-card sex.

09:25.500 --> 09:26.790
I don't want to be
a kept woman.

09:26.790 --> 09:29.210
Okay, fine, then
how about I just give you
some frequent flier miles?

09:29.210 --> 09:31.620
Oh, my God.

09:31.620 --> 09:33.880
You would give me
your frequent flier miles

09:33.880 --> 09:35.580
so I could fly
to Punta Cana first class?

09:35.580 --> 09:37.170
-I never said first class.
-Could you?

09:43.420 --> 09:45.830
Elliot, we got a bite
on your resumé.

09:45.830 --> 09:47.210
You're kidding me!

09:48.580 --> 09:50.210
I knew I was good.

09:50.210 --> 09:52.540
Guess who's looking
for a new publicist?

09:52.540 --> 09:53.750
Dante Bergeson.

09:53.750 --> 09:56.460
The multi-billionaire who
single-handedly changed

09:56.460 --> 09:58.080
the way the world
drinks vodka?

09:59.080 --> 10:00.750
I still just drink it
straight from the bottle.

10:01.880 --> 10:03.170
But that's your guy.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.710
And he wants to have
lunch with you today.

10:04.710 --> 10:06.580
Are you kidding me?

10:06.580 --> 10:07.880
-I could hug you.
-Don't.

10:09.250 --> 10:11.580
Just go dangle Dante
in front of Josh.

10:11.580 --> 10:12.960
Whoa!

10:12.960 --> 10:14.420
Freshly cleaned hoodie!

10:14.420 --> 10:15.670
Hey!

10:15.670 --> 10:18.250
I'm going to need you
to go online and do
traffic school for me.

10:18.250 --> 10:19.290
Thanks.

10:19.290 --> 10:23.380
Oh! I would, but
unfortunately for you,

10:23.380 --> 10:25.710
I have a lunch meeting
this afternoon
with Dante Bergeson.

10:25.710 --> 10:27.750
The billionaire who
started a space program

10:27.750 --> 10:29.790
so that Bruno Mars
can perform on Mars.

10:31.540 --> 10:32.670
Why are you meeting
with him?

10:32.670 --> 10:34.880
Well, he needs
a new publicist

10:34.880 --> 10:37.540
and heard I'm feeling
a tad... unchallenged.

10:37.540 --> 10:39.380
Unchallenged?

10:39.380 --> 10:41.580
So camping out
overnight in a rainstorm,

10:41.580 --> 10:43.120
so I can get
my new phone was easy?

10:44.380 --> 10:45.420
That's it, Josh.

10:45.420 --> 10:47.500
I'm not an errand boy,
I'm a publicist,

10:47.500 --> 10:49.380
and if you can't
recognize it,
maybe Dante can!

10:49.380 --> 10:51.920
-Whoa, Elliot--
-Yeah. Whoa, Elliot!

10:51.920 --> 10:53.540
Don't whoa me, Josh.

10:53.540 --> 10:56.080
I am sick of kissing
that perfect ass of yours.

10:57.210 --> 10:59.580
Good luck
replacing this, Josh.

11:01.330 --> 11:03.580
-(door slams)
-What the hell was that?

11:03.580 --> 11:04.880
I don't know.

11:04.880 --> 11:07.420
Uh, but I can't do that
traffic school thing for you.

11:08.420 --> 11:10.460
My license
is a little iffy.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.000
How great was
that storm-out?

11:16.000 --> 11:19.500
And they say you
don't learn anything
from the Real Housewives.

11:19.500 --> 11:21.380
Elliot, I have
something tell you.

11:21.380 --> 11:22.620
Of course you do.

11:22.620 --> 11:24.710
Where is my lunch meeting
with Dante?

11:24.710 --> 11:26.420
On the corner of...

11:26.420 --> 11:28.710
"I made it up,"
and "You went too far."

11:30.330 --> 11:31.380
What?

11:31.380 --> 11:33.540
There is no lunch.

11:33.540 --> 11:36.380
You know, I was just trying
to give a little confidence,

11:36.380 --> 11:37.460
light a fire under you.

11:37.460 --> 11:39.830
I didn't know you
was gonna burn down
the whole damn bridge!

11:39.830 --> 11:42.380
(gasping)
Oh, my God.
I can't breathe.

11:42.380 --> 11:44.250
-How could you
do this to me?
-(elevator dings)

11:44.250 --> 11:46.040
You ruined my life!

11:46.040 --> 11:48.380
Whe-- Where
are you going?

11:48.380 --> 11:52.120
To figure out how to be
Josh's bitch again!

11:57.460 --> 11:58.920
Mm-mm!

11:58.920 --> 12:00.500
How hot is my man?

12:00.500 --> 12:02.250
Well, I can only
see his butt.

12:02.250 --> 12:05.420
Ain't it juicy?
You can say yes.

12:05.420 --> 12:06.960
-Yes.
-Mm-hmm.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.500
Oh, hey!

12:09.500 --> 12:13.330
Is this the table
for all the girls going
to Punta Cana?

12:14.380 --> 12:16.710
Gabi, what are
you doing here?

12:16.710 --> 12:18.330
Oh, I just came
over to say,

12:18.330 --> 12:20.830
have a good flight,
have a good time, and...

12:21.830 --> 12:23.170
I'll see you there.

12:23.170 --> 12:26.920
You're not gonna see us there
because I you lost and I won.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.250
Oh. Well,
let's just say

12:29.250 --> 12:34.170
a certain someone gave
a 100,000 frequent flier
miles to a certain me.

12:35.330 --> 12:38.080
Oh, my God. You went crying
to Josh for a ticket?

12:38.080 --> 12:39.120
No.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.170
He gave me the ticket
before I started crying.

12:42.250 --> 12:43.500
Okay, where are
you going to stay?

12:43.500 --> 12:44.540
Well, not to worry.

12:44.540 --> 12:46.880
Called the resort,
handled the whole thing.

12:46.880 --> 12:48.790
Turns out,
they do have a room.

12:48.790 --> 12:50.830
Sure, it's the size
of a closet,

12:50.830 --> 12:52.250
sure, I may have
to wear a name tag,

12:52.250 --> 12:53.580
and do a little
janitorial work,

12:53.580 --> 12:55.380
but... I'm in!

12:55.380 --> 12:57.790
So I will see you
bitches at the pool.

12:57.790 --> 12:59.210
(slurping)

12:59.210 --> 13:01.710
I cannot believe that you are
such a sore loser

13:01.710 --> 13:05.460
that you had to weasel
your way into my vacation,
that I won!

13:05.460 --> 13:08.290
Why are you so upset?
I thought you'd be thrilled
I was joining you.

13:08.290 --> 13:09.920
-Do I look thrilled?
-Hey!

13:09.920 --> 13:12.710
If I wanted to listen
to two little bitches fight
over me,

13:12.710 --> 13:14.250
I'd still be dating
the Jonas Brothers.

13:15.670 --> 13:18.790
Now, we are leaving
in two hours.

13:18.790 --> 13:20.710
I'm gonna go wax
my Punta Cana

13:20.710 --> 13:23.830
and swing by in the the limo
to pick you girls up.

13:23.830 --> 13:26.420
Now, Stop!
'Causin'! Drama!

13:30.460 --> 13:32.460
I cannot believe
you did this.

13:32.460 --> 13:34.330
I don't understand
why you're not happy.

13:34.330 --> 13:35.960
I mean, you get to go
on vacation,

13:35.960 --> 13:37.330
I get to go on vacation.

13:37.330 --> 13:39.380
We are both going
to Punta Cana.

13:40.380 --> 13:41.380
Oh...

13:45.620 --> 13:48.330
Not if Carlo keeps making
out with that Punta Cana.

13:54.540 --> 13:55.580
(door slams)

13:55.580 --> 13:57.000
Elliot,
where have you been?

13:57.000 --> 13:59.250
I was begging for a job.

13:59.250 --> 14:01.540
But Alan wasn't in the mood,
so I went for a walk.

14:03.330 --> 14:04.830
Look, Elliot,
I was just trying to help.

14:04.830 --> 14:07.960
I was so mad at you,
Yolanda, I didn't realize

14:07.960 --> 14:09.420
that I could actually use

14:09.420 --> 14:11.460
this whole situation
to my favor.

14:11.460 --> 14:14.750
All I have to do is make
Josh think Dante wants me,

14:14.750 --> 14:17.290
then he'll cave and offer
me everything I deserve.

14:17.290 --> 14:20.000
-Josh:
Elliot!
-The game is afoot!

14:21.290 --> 14:23.460
Okay, thanks again so much
for doing this, Dante.

14:23.460 --> 14:26.290
When he comes in here,
just turn your chair away
from us and try not to laugh.

14:26.290 --> 14:27.750
Righty-oh.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.170
Elliot...

14:34.920 --> 14:37.000
Now, give it to me straight.
Are you still my publicist

14:37.000 --> 14:38.960
or did Dante steal
you away from me?

14:38.960 --> 14:40.830
Well, Josh,
I don't want to lie.

14:42.120 --> 14:43.750
He did wine
and dine me pretty hard.

14:43.750 --> 14:46.120
We're talking caviar,
Dom Pérignon,

14:46.120 --> 14:48.170
shrimp the size
of a baby's arm.

14:48.170 --> 14:50.710
Big ticket stuff, Josh.
Big ticket stuff.

14:50.710 --> 14:53.080
Wow. It sounds like
he really wants you.

14:53.080 --> 14:54.920
In more ways than one.

14:54.920 --> 14:57.330
After his third drink,
he got kinda handsy.

14:58.540 --> 15:00.790
I would have been
flattered if he was hot.

15:00.790 --> 15:02.960
But he was nasty!

15:04.120 --> 15:07.120
The point is, even though
he thinks I'm amazing,

15:07.120 --> 15:08.580
offered me more money,

15:08.580 --> 15:10.670
and said I'm one of
the best publicists in town,

15:10.670 --> 15:14.120
nay, the world...
I turned him down.

15:14.120 --> 15:15.250
Dante:
Did you?

15:15.250 --> 15:16.500
What was that?

15:18.210 --> 15:20.620
It kind of sounds a little like
the guy you turned down.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.290
My good friend...
Dante Bergeson.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.290
Dante Bergeson!

15:25.330 --> 15:26.960
Good to see
you again, sir.

15:26.960 --> 15:31.420
I've never met you,
nor molested you in my life.

15:31.420 --> 15:33.170
You lied to me.

15:33.170 --> 15:38.170
I'm so sorry, Josh.
Please don't fire me! Please!

15:38.170 --> 15:42.120
I've always said,
when one man is crying
on the floor, it's time to go.

15:43.250 --> 15:44.250
Cheerio, Josh.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.880
What's going on?

15:52.500 --> 15:55.540
I just wanted
you to respect me
as a publicist.

15:56.580 --> 15:59.170
I do your dry-cleaning,
run your errands,

15:59.170 --> 16:00.750
comb your hair
while you sleep--

16:00.750 --> 16:02.460
I never asked
for that last one.

16:02.460 --> 16:05.380
All I'm looking for
is a little respect.

16:05.380 --> 16:07.790
Do you even think
I'm a good publicist?

16:07.790 --> 16:10.880
Why do you think I called
your college and told them
you should give that speech?

16:10.880 --> 16:14.210
-You did that?
-Hell, yeah I did.

16:14.210 --> 16:18.170
And look, from now on,
I will hire someone else
to do my personal tasks.

16:18.170 --> 16:19.500
Thank you.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.250
But there's still
a few I can do.

16:21.250 --> 16:22.710
Whatever you're
comfortable with.

16:22.710 --> 16:24.000
Great!

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Now why don't you go take
a nap and I'll get the comb?

16:31.290 --> 16:32.670
Man, how are
we gonna tell Lizette

16:32.670 --> 16:34.790
we saw her fiancé
making out with
another woman?

16:34.790 --> 16:37.040
Very gently,
and after the wedding.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.580
(scoffs) Wait a minute.
Are you kidding me?

16:40.580 --> 16:42.670
You want to go on
this vacation so bad

16:42.670 --> 16:44.170
that you totally
feel justified

16:44.170 --> 16:46.170
ruining the rest
of Lizette's life?

16:46.170 --> 16:47.790
Yes, because I won.

16:49.210 --> 16:52.290
Come on! This is not you.
Don't be so selfish!

16:52.290 --> 16:55.120
If I was engaged
and I was going to get married,

16:55.120 --> 16:57.170
and you saw my fiancé
making out with another woman,

16:57.170 --> 16:58.580
wouldn't you tell me?

16:58.580 --> 16:59.960
Is it a destination wedding?

16:59.960 --> 17:01.710
(knocks on the door)

17:01.710 --> 17:04.540
Okay, that's her.
We have to tell her.

17:04.540 --> 17:06.080
-Ugh, Gabi--
-Do the right thing.

17:06.080 --> 17:07.080
Fine!

17:09.420 --> 17:11.790
The limo awaits,
girls!

17:11.790 --> 17:13.210
-Lizette...
-Hmm?

17:14.460 --> 17:15.830
Let's not keep it
a-waitin'.

17:17.080 --> 17:18.380
-Sofia!
-See ya!

17:19.790 --> 17:21.000
Lizette!

17:21.000 --> 17:22.620
Your fiancé
is cheating on you!

17:24.620 --> 17:25.620
What?

17:27.120 --> 17:29.290
I'm really sorry,
but we saw...

17:29.290 --> 17:33.710
Carlo making out
with some blonde
at the bar after you left.

17:33.710 --> 17:35.880
No, that's bull.
He would never--
He loves me.

17:35.880 --> 17:39.670
(gasps) Oh!
This is devastating.

17:39.670 --> 17:41.580
I mean, what kind
of marriage is this
gonna be

17:41.580 --> 17:42.920
if we're
both having affairs?

17:45.380 --> 17:48.120
If you'll excuse me,
I have a visa to revoke.

17:51.580 --> 17:52.830
Oh, man.

17:52.830 --> 17:55.540
I hated doing that,
but, you know, I had to do it.

17:55.540 --> 17:57.120
Did we, Gabi?

17:57.120 --> 17:59.210
I can't believe
you ruined our vacation.

17:59.210 --> 18:00.790
We were this close--

18:02.000 --> 18:03.920
Oh... I get it.

18:03.920 --> 18:04.960
(laughs)

18:04.960 --> 18:07.040
So, you didn't
care if I didn't get to go

18:07.040 --> 18:09.500
because you get to go
no matter what.

18:09.500 --> 18:10.710
-What?
-That's right.

18:10.710 --> 18:12.710
You didn't do it because
it was the right thing to do.

18:12.710 --> 18:15.250
You did it was because
you cannot stand
the fact that I beat you.

18:15.250 --> 18:17.880
Sofia, what's going on?
Why are you acting like this?

18:17.880 --> 18:18.880
This isn't you.

18:20.670 --> 18:21.710
(sighs)

18:21.710 --> 18:23.000
Kendrick got engaged.

18:24.210 --> 18:25.250
What?

18:25.250 --> 18:26.960
Why didn't you tell me?

18:28.420 --> 18:30.750
He proposed to his girlfriend
in the middle of the office,

18:30.750 --> 18:32.960
and they all know that
I have a crush on him,

18:32.960 --> 18:35.620
and then they were all
looking at me with these
sad puppy dog eyes.

18:36.750 --> 18:37.880
Yeah, like that.

18:39.790 --> 18:41.920
Now-- Now they just
think I am a big looser.

18:41.920 --> 18:45.040
Oh, no.
He's the loser.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.460
-Gabi...
-Yeah, I know,
that was lame.

18:48.000 --> 18:48.920
(sighs)

18:48.920 --> 18:51.290
And I just thought that
if I could go on vacation

18:51.290 --> 18:53.710
that I wouldn't have
to go into the office.

18:53.710 --> 18:56.040
Oh... I'm really sorry.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.120
You know what?

18:58.120 --> 18:59.710
You are going
on this vacation.

18:59.710 --> 19:01.830
-How?
-You're gonna
take my ticket.

19:01.830 --> 19:03.460
Oh, no,
I can't do that--

19:03.460 --> 19:06.380
Yes, you can,
and you need it
way more than me.

19:06.380 --> 19:07.960
Come on.

19:07.960 --> 19:09.670
We can't let that new
bikini go to waste.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.750
I do rock those
boy short bottoms.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.290
You're the best
friend ever.

19:16.290 --> 19:18.290
Oh, no you are.

19:19.540 --> 19:21.250
Now, go.

19:21.250 --> 19:22.710
(crying)
Okay, bye!

19:24.580 --> 19:25.960
(cries)

19:25.960 --> 19:27.120
She bought it!

19:28.420 --> 19:29.420
I win!

19:31.420 --> 19:32.460
(exhales)

19:32.460 --> 19:33.920
Staycation, take two.

19:33.920 --> 19:36.880
This time...
(in Jamaican accent)
Jamaica, mon.

19:36.880 --> 19:41.080
(reggae music playing)

19:41.080 --> 19:45.620
(thunder rumbling)

19:45.620 --> 19:47.000
Seriously?

19:47.000 --> 19:48.880
God! If you can hear me--

19:48.880 --> 19:50.170
Sofia: Gabi!

19:50.170 --> 19:51.920
Oh, my God. God,
you sound just like Sofia.

19:52.790 --> 19:54.000
Gabi?

19:54.000 --> 19:55.040
Hey!

19:55.040 --> 19:56.170
What are you doing here?

19:56.170 --> 19:57.750
You're supposed
to be in first class,

19:57.750 --> 19:59.960
enjoying free champagne,
and the extra legroom,

19:59.960 --> 20:01.540
and ABC's new fall lineup.

20:03.750 --> 20:05.830
-I couldn't go.
-Why not?

20:05.830 --> 20:07.790
Well, because I was
sitting in my taxi,

20:07.790 --> 20:09.210
on the way to the airport,

20:09.210 --> 20:11.750
when I saw that
my driver's name was Anal...

20:13.580 --> 20:15.830
and I thought
it was so funny, but I...

20:15.830 --> 20:17.710
There was no one
there to laugh with me.

20:17.710 --> 20:18.750
(laughs)

20:18.750 --> 20:20.000
Anal!

20:20.000 --> 20:22.750
-(laughs)
That's hilarious!
-Sofia: Right?

20:22.750 --> 20:24.040
And then I thought,
you know,

20:24.040 --> 20:26.670
I might've beaten you out
for this vacation, but...

20:26.670 --> 20:29.620
what does winning matter,
when I don't get to spend
it with my best friend?

20:29.620 --> 20:31.040
Oh...

20:31.040 --> 20:32.620
But wait a minute.

20:32.620 --> 20:34.040
I thought you said
you needed to go

20:34.040 --> 20:36.830
'cause you had to forget
about Kendrick's engagement?

20:36.830 --> 20:38.290
No...

20:38.290 --> 20:41.710
but I hope you will...
because I lied about it.

20:41.710 --> 20:44.620
I made it up,
I just-- I wanted
you to feel sorry for me

20:44.620 --> 20:45.670
so that I could win.

20:45.670 --> 20:47.460
Are you serious?

20:47.460 --> 20:50.920
You lied and manipulated me
to get what you want?

20:52.040 --> 20:53.380
Respect, girl.

20:55.500 --> 20:57.290
Wait.
You're impressed?

20:57.290 --> 21:00.000
Uh, yeah. That means
I'm rubbing off on you.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.500
The student becomes the master.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.580
Oh, my God.
I'm so relieved!

21:03.580 --> 21:05.460
I thought I was gonna
have to get you drunk first.

21:05.460 --> 21:07.080
I'm already two
rum punches in.

21:08.460 --> 21:11.210
Pull up a hammock.
We're in Jamaica, mon!

21:11.210 --> 21:13.120
-(laughs)
-(car horn honking)

21:13.120 --> 21:15.620
Oh, my God. I forgot
to pay for Anal.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.330
Are we sure
it's not "Anahl"?

21:19.330 --> 21:20.710
Probably,
but it's not as funny.

21:20.710 --> 21:21.750
I'm gonna grab
my purse.

21:21.750 --> 21:23.790
Anal, I'm coming!
