00:01.293 --> 00:02.761
Kids, in the fall of 2010,

00:02.762 --> 00:04.295
<i>I was designing
the new headquarters</i>

00:04.296 --> 00:05.596
<i>for Goliath National Bank,</i>

00:05.598 --> 00:07.632
<i>which meant
working side by side</i>

00:07.633 --> 00:08.800
<i>with your Uncle Barney.</i>

00:08.801 --> 00:09.901
I love your idea

00:09.902 --> 00:11.203
about a giant
rooftop ring of fire

00:11.204 --> 00:12.571
you can jump through
with a motorcycle,

00:12.572 --> 00:14.472
but I tweaked it
slightly and...

00:14.473 --> 00:16.157
This is still
super bad-ass.

00:17.777 --> 00:20.362
It's now a patio garden
where you can bring a nice bag lunch.

00:21.363 --> 00:22.663
Sick.

00:22.664 --> 00:23.948
Yeah.

00:23.949 --> 00:25.032
Dude.

00:25.033 --> 00:28.285
Working together
is gonna be legen...

00:28.286 --> 00:29.537
Wait for it.

00:29.538 --> 00:31.822
I'll send you an inter-office
memo with the rest

00:31.823 --> 00:33.657
'cause we freakin'
work together!

00:33.658 --> 00:35.376
<i>Everything was going great.</i>

00:35.377 --> 00:37.511
<i>That is, right up
until Barney said...</i>

00:37.512 --> 00:38.762
Oh, big news.

00:38.763 --> 00:40.631
The board finally settled on
a site for the building.

00:41.766 --> 00:43.017
<i>It was the site
of The Arcadian,</i>

00:43.018 --> 00:44.969
<i>one of New York's grandest
old hotels.</i>

00:44.970 --> 00:48.022
<i>In its heyday, it was the New
York home to kings and queens.</i>

00:48.023 --> 00:49.223
<i>But lately...</i>

00:51.726 --> 00:53.477
<i>...mostly just queens.</i>

00:53.478 --> 00:55.062
Hi, handsome.

00:55.063 --> 00:56.864
Lookin' for a date?

00:56.865 --> 00:58.399
Uh, no, thank you.

01:00.402 --> 01:03.070
Still got it.

01:03.071 --> 01:05.522
Barney, we have to talk.

01:05.522 --> 01:06.707
Sure. What's up?

01:06.708 --> 01:07.775
Excuse me,
Mr. Stinson.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.326
Not now, Trish!

01:09.327 --> 01:11.912
But there's an urgent
memo for Mr. Mosby.

01:14.549 --> 01:17.635
"Dary."
Legendary!

01:18.420 --> 01:21.088
So, what's on your mind?

01:22.257 --> 01:24.642
I can't design the building.

01:24.643 --> 01:35.712
Sync by fant0m
www.addic7ed.com

01:37.572 --> 01:39.657
Oh, yeah.

01:39.658 --> 01:41.725
Oh, baby. No, no.

01:41.726 --> 01:44.695
Not the slipper socks
with the rubber soles.

01:44.696 --> 01:47.031
I work so hard
to-to set the mood,

01:47.032 --> 01:48.315
and-and when I see those,

01:48.316 --> 01:50.367
I feel the egg go

01:50.368 --> 01:52.419
right back up my Fallopian tube.

01:52.420 --> 01:55.039
Baby, these satin sheets
are slippery.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.041
Papa needs traction.
Traction?

01:57.042 --> 01:58.125
As you know,

01:58.126 --> 02:00.010
Papa likes
to get down with enthusiasm.

02:00.011 --> 02:01.879
Please stop calling
yourself "Papa."

02:01.880 --> 02:03.130
And without traction,

02:03.131 --> 02:05.015
Papa's likely to boogie himself
right out of bed.

02:05.016 --> 02:06.450
It's either these
or soccer cleats.

02:08.687 --> 02:11.055
Hey, so I talked to Robin.

02:11.056 --> 02:13.273
I guess she and Max
hooked up last night.

02:13.274 --> 02:15.225
<i>Kids, as you may remember,
Max was a friend of Marshall's</i>

02:15.226 --> 02:16.510
<i>from law school...</i>

02:16.511 --> 02:19.163
<i>with whom Robin was really
starting to hit it off.</i>

02:19.164 --> 02:20.931
Nice! I love that guy.

02:20.932 --> 02:24.985
Max is both his name
and his level of awesomeness.

02:24.986 --> 02:25.986
Yeah. He's a sweet guy.

02:25.987 --> 02:27.738
She feels really
comfortable with him.

02:27.739 --> 02:29.156
They bonded over hockey.

02:29.157 --> 02:30.824
I guess he has a small penis,

02:30.825 --> 02:32.576
but they want to
double-date next weekend.

02:33.812 --> 02:35.295
Why would you tell me that?

02:35.296 --> 02:37.131
So you'll clear your schedule.

02:37.132 --> 02:38.832
No! The other part!

02:38.833 --> 02:40.467
Oh, the small penis thing?

02:40.468 --> 02:41.785
Ah! Don't! Stop saying that!

02:41.786 --> 02:43.286
Why do you keep saying that?
You...

02:43.287 --> 02:44.588
I don't want to know that.

02:44.589 --> 02:46.090
I'm not going to be able
to look the guy in the eye.

02:46.091 --> 02:48.976
I'm certainly not going
to be able to call him "Max."

02:48.977 --> 02:50.310
That's insane.

02:50.311 --> 02:52.429
I mean, just because you
know Max has a small penis...

02:52.430 --> 02:55.349
Just don't!

02:55.350 --> 02:56.834
You're kidding me.

02:56.835 --> 02:58.135
I'm sorry. I can't do this

02:58.136 --> 03:00.070
if it means tearing down
The Arcadian.

03:00.071 --> 03:01.739
It's an architectural landmark.

03:01.740 --> 03:03.640
Plus, people live there.

03:03.641 --> 03:05.526
How does GNB plan to get
hundreds of residents

03:05.527 --> 03:06.643
to just up and leave?

03:06.644 --> 03:08.162
Snakes.
Did you just say "snakes"?

03:08.163 --> 03:10.364
I don't recall saying "snakes""

03:10.365 --> 03:14.168
Ted, I know you love crappy
old stuff no one cares about.

03:14.169 --> 03:17.254
But I'm gonna give you
four words to live by:

03:17.255 --> 03:21.008
New is always better.

03:21.009 --> 03:22.543
New is always better?

03:22.544 --> 03:24.745
You know who's
a million times hotter

03:24.746 --> 03:26.714
than the hottest girl
I've ever slept with?

03:26.715 --> 03:30.350
Her okay-looking friend
I haven't seen naked.

03:30.351 --> 03:31.685
Why?

03:31.686 --> 03:34.154
Because new is always better.

03:34.155 --> 03:36.540
Mm-hmm? And this theory
applies to everything?

03:36.541 --> 03:37.524
Everything.

03:37.525 --> 03:38.459
So, those new

03:38.460 --> 03:39.843
<i>Star Wars movies...</i>

03:39.844 --> 03:41.528
Those are better
than the old ones?

03:41.529 --> 03:44.448
Yeah. The first three
barely mention

03:44.449 --> 03:47.401
the intricacies
of intergalactic trade law.

03:47.402 --> 03:49.470
And when you're
at a Guns n' Roses concert,

03:49.471 --> 03:52.039
you're like, "Yeah, yeah,
Paradise City, whatever.

03:52.040 --> 03:55.525
When are they gonna rock me
some Chinese Democracy"?

03:55.526 --> 03:58.579
Axl's really matured
as a songwriter, Ted.

03:58.580 --> 04:01.231
Wendy! I'd like to buy
my friend a drink.

04:01.232 --> 04:02.583
What's your oldest Scotch?

04:02.584 --> 04:05.702
Glenmckenna, aged 30 years
in oak casks.

04:05.703 --> 04:06.653
Amazing.

04:06.654 --> 04:08.088
And what's your newest scotch?

04:08.089 --> 04:11.508
Jumbo Jim's Grape Scotch.

04:11.509 --> 04:13.510
Don't let it touch your skin.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.480
Your call, buddy.

04:18.750 --> 04:22.269
A glass of the J-Jumbo Jim's
Grape Scotch sounds lovely.

04:22.270 --> 04:24.188
Lots of ice.

04:25.073 --> 04:26.740
New is always better, Ted!

04:26.741 --> 04:27.825
That's a rule.

04:27.826 --> 04:29.326
Just like bigger
is always better!

04:29.327 --> 04:31.495
Pfft. That's not true.

04:31.496 --> 04:33.614
Uh, sometimes smaller is better.

04:33.615 --> 04:36.033
"Hey, look how big
my cell phone is!"

04:36.034 --> 04:38.418
You don't hear people say that.

04:38.419 --> 04:39.920
No. You want
something compact

04:39.921 --> 04:42.673
and efficient that fits
comfortably in your pocket,

04:42.674 --> 04:45.592
and I think Max
is just a great guy.

04:45.593 --> 04:46.794
Lily told you.

04:46.795 --> 04:47.795
Told him what?

04:47.796 --> 04:48.796
Max has a small penis.

04:50.431 --> 04:52.966
How can you speak
of such things?

04:52.967 --> 04:54.134
Girls talk about everything.

04:54.135 --> 04:55.269
Size, shape,

04:55.270 --> 04:57.137
left or right
leaning orientation...

04:57.138 --> 04:59.106
Length, resemblance to
a historical figure,

04:59.107 --> 05:00.541
such as Winston Churchill...

05:00.542 --> 05:01.775
Yes, that's one of you.

05:01.776 --> 05:03.143
Girth, grooming...

05:03.144 --> 05:05.529
How can you speak
of such things?

05:05.530 --> 05:06.763
You're kidding.

05:06.764 --> 05:09.366
Barney, every time I mention
a woman you don't know,

05:09.367 --> 05:11.618
the first thing
you say is, "Boobs?"

05:11.619 --> 05:14.538
Not the complete sentence,
"Does she have big boobs?"

05:14.539 --> 05:15.989
Which also would not be great.

05:15.990 --> 05:17.457
Just: "Boobs?"

05:17.458 --> 05:19.493
I do not do that.

05:19.494 --> 05:20.544
My friend Lori from work...

05:20.545 --> 05:22.296
Boobs? Damn it.

05:22.297 --> 05:23.947
But... seriously.

05:23.948 --> 05:25.249
Boobs?

05:25.250 --> 05:26.333
So why is it okay

05:26.334 --> 05:27.668
for guys to talk about boobs,

05:27.669 --> 05:29.219
but the moment we
bring up a topic

05:29.220 --> 05:30.671
like Max's small penis...

05:31.973 --> 05:34.224
I'm gonna pretend this
conversation never happened.

05:34.225 --> 05:37.811
Impossible. Max's penis is stuck
in my brain like a splinter.

05:37.812 --> 05:40.397
Like a splinter-sized splinter.

05:40.398 --> 05:42.632
Speaking of
disappointing weenies...

05:42.633 --> 05:44.434
Ted, tell them what you told me

05:44.435 --> 05:47.637
I want to ask the board at GNB

05:47.638 --> 05:49.639
to move the site
for the new headquarters

05:49.640 --> 05:51.474
so we don't have to tear
down a classic old building.

05:51.475 --> 05:53.026
I still don't get this.

05:53.027 --> 05:55.696
Why, all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

05:55.697 --> 05:57.631
do you want to ruin...

05:57.632 --> 05:59.683
Wait a minute.

06:00.184 --> 06:02.336
Who's the girl?

06:02.337 --> 06:04.154
- Duh. 
- Of course there's a girl.

06:04.155 --> 06:05.422
What? I...

06:05.423 --> 06:07.391
There's no g-girl.

06:07.392 --> 06:09.092
Why would you even...

06:09.961 --> 06:12.346
Her name is Zoey.

06:12.347 --> 06:13.630
Boobs?

06:18.887 --> 06:20.837
Beautiful building, right?

06:20.838 --> 06:23.807
Look, mister, you
are very convincing,

06:23.808 --> 06:26.276
and I am very flattered.

06:26.277 --> 06:28.011
Confused, even.

06:28.012 --> 06:29.062
But I'm not looking...

06:29.063 --> 06:31.415
I'm not a drag queen.

06:31.416 --> 06:34.651
But you definitely have me
rethinking this eye shadow.

06:34.652 --> 06:36.536
Not only is she funny,

06:36.537 --> 06:38.872
hot and genetically female,

06:38.873 --> 06:40.574
but get this...

06:40.575 --> 06:44.044
Look at the Palladian windows,
the rusticated stonework,

06:44.045 --> 06:46.046
the marble cornices...

06:46.864 --> 06:48.582
She's an architecture nerd!

06:48.583 --> 06:50.033
A hot architecture nerd!

06:50.034 --> 06:51.535
That's the dream!

06:51.536 --> 06:53.420
Whose dream?

06:53.421 --> 06:55.505
We wound up talking for hours.

06:55.506 --> 06:58.592
I love how old parts
of the city are.

06:58.593 --> 06:59.776
Hmm.

06:59.777 --> 07:01.478
It makes me feel
connected to history.

07:01.479 --> 07:04.014
Old is always better.
I can't wait to be old.

07:04.015 --> 07:05.132
Me, too.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.683
You can wear
elastic everything.

07:06.684 --> 07:09.152
Your lipstick doesn't have
to stay inside the lines.

07:09.153 --> 07:11.438
You can shoplift and pretend
you're just confused.

07:13.391 --> 07:15.108
You could nap anywhere.
Uh-huh.

07:15.109 --> 07:16.059
Even while driving.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.577
It's gonna be great.

07:17.578 --> 07:19.896
I can't wait to be all run-down
and weathered and wrinkly.

07:19.897 --> 07:24.034
Well, I'd say you got
a pretty long wait.

07:24.035 --> 07:26.286
That's sweet.

07:26.287 --> 07:27.921
It would be sweeter
if you hadn't thought

07:27.922 --> 07:31.425
I was a tranny before,
but it's still sweet.

07:32.343 --> 07:34.261
Oh, Ted, that's so romantic.

07:34.262 --> 07:35.679
I want to fill a pillowcase

07:35.680 --> 07:38.015
with dead batteries
and beat you with it.

07:38.016 --> 07:39.599
Hey, Ted,

07:39.600 --> 07:41.051
can I ask you something?

07:41.052 --> 07:42.636
Anything.

07:47.108 --> 07:48.809
Will you sign this petition?

07:49.861 --> 07:51.995
"Save The Arcadian""

07:51.996 --> 07:54.147
We are gonna stop the bastards
at Goliath National Bank

07:54.148 --> 07:55.565
from demolishing it.

07:57.502 --> 07:58.802
Will you support us?

07:59.937 --> 08:01.822
And you said...?

08:01.823 --> 08:04.474
Where do I sign?

08:06.277 --> 08:07.944
Hmm.

08:07.945 --> 08:09.813
Grape scotch.
Not bad.

08:13.364 --> 08:15.748
Ted, you only think The
Arcadian needs to be saved

08:15.749 --> 08:17.700
because some pretty
girl thinks that.

08:17.701 --> 08:19.068
And seriously...

08:19.069 --> 08:19.869
Boobs?

08:19.870 --> 08:21.421
This isn't about the girl.

08:21.422 --> 08:22.839
It's about the building.

08:22.840 --> 08:25.308
And what did this "Zoey" say

08:25.309 --> 08:27.410
when she found out
that you're the one

08:27.411 --> 08:29.245
tearing down her
beloved Arcadian?

08:29.246 --> 08:32.664
That you, Ted Mosby, are the
Architect Of Destruction?

08:32.666 --> 08:33.850
Whoa!

08:33.851 --> 08:35.818
Sweet wrestling name alert.

08:36.520 --> 08:37.937
Well...

08:37.938 --> 08:41.090
Uh, it's a... it's a
funny thing about that...

08:41.091 --> 08:42.859
So what do you do, Ted?

08:42.860 --> 08:44.561
I'm a veterinarian.

08:45.596 --> 08:46.729
What? I panicked!

08:46.730 --> 08:49.432
This whole Arcadian
thing is classic Mosby.

08:49.433 --> 08:52.101
Changing your personality
to fit some girl.

08:52.102 --> 08:54.954
I don't do that.

08:55.706 --> 08:58.124
Well, off to meet Steph.

08:58.125 --> 09:01.828
We're adrenaline junkies!

09:04.548 --> 09:07.783
Penelope is taking me to
the Battle of Gettysburg.

09:07.784 --> 09:10.970
We're gonna eat squirrel!

09:16.560 --> 09:18.912
Look, she's really hot, okay?

09:22.116 --> 09:24.267
Aww!
Come on! Come on!

09:24.268 --> 09:26.486
We all change a little
for whoever we're into.

09:26.487 --> 09:28.655
Barney pretended
to be a rabbi to get laid.

09:28.656 --> 09:31.658
Asian girls love
them some Jews.

09:31.659 --> 09:33.076
And Marshall never
would've listened

09:33.077 --> 09:34.827
to The Indigo Girls
if it weren't for Lily.

09:34.828 --> 09:37.330
Um, I think you got that
backwards there, Chief.

09:37.331 --> 09:40.283
And you're welcome.

09:40.284 --> 09:41.817
The point is,
you weren't pretending

09:41.818 --> 09:43.503
to like the Indigo Girls
for the other person.

09:43.504 --> 09:46.422
You realized you liked them
because of the other person.

09:46.423 --> 09:48.875
Just like me, Zoey
and The Arcadian.

09:49.760 --> 09:52.295
Did GNB really put snakes
in The Arcadian?

09:52.296 --> 09:54.113
No.

09:54.114 --> 09:55.798
Technically, they were eggs.

09:55.799 --> 09:58.351
Did you just say "eggs"?
I don't recall saying "eggs."

09:59.136 --> 10:01.604
So I walk into my boss's office

10:01.605 --> 10:02.872
and suddenly I realize,

10:02.873 --> 10:05.692
"Holy crap, I'm about to quit""

10:05.693 --> 10:07.009
Small penis.

10:07.010 --> 10:08.778
<i>You have a small penis.</i>

10:08.779 --> 10:12.015
<i>Oh, that's super interesting,
but you have a small penis.</i>

10:12.016 --> 10:13.316
<i>Damn it, Marshall!</i>

10:13.317 --> 10:15.235
<i>Okay. Okay.
Think of any two words</i>

10:15.236 --> 10:17.520
other than "small" or "penis."

10:17.521 --> 10:19.405
<i>Got it: small penis.</i>

10:19.406 --> 10:20.573
<i>Damn it!</i>

10:20.574 --> 10:22.408
Yeah, I-I think it is so cool

10:22.409 --> 10:24.026
that you started
your own law firm.

10:24.027 --> 10:27.797
Well, right now it's
a pretty small practice.

10:27.798 --> 10:29.499
Hey, hey.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.751
I bet it's not that small.

10:32.503 --> 10:33.636
Bro, it's...

10:33.637 --> 10:35.388
pretty small.

10:35.389 --> 10:36.923
Yeah, but, uh,
you know what they say.

10:36.924 --> 10:39.008
The important thing is-is
how you use it, you know?

10:39.009 --> 10:41.094
"The motion of the ocean."
That whole thing.

10:41.095 --> 10:42.929
He said it's small, Marshall,
and everybody's fine with that.

10:42.930 --> 10:44.547
Let's just move on.

10:44.548 --> 10:48.268
I'm just saying that I bet
it's bigger than he thinks.

10:48.269 --> 10:50.019
And thick.

10:51.405 --> 10:52.722
Nah.
Everything about it is tiny.

10:52.723 --> 10:55.908
The office is tiny.
The conference room is tiny.

10:55.909 --> 10:57.910
Plus, I got a very small staff.

10:57.911 --> 10:59.729
Let's order!

10:59.730 --> 11:01.948
As I was mustering
the courage to call Zoey

11:01.949 --> 11:03.616
<i>and tell her
my true identity...</i>

11:03.617 --> 11:05.201
Zoey...

11:05.202 --> 11:07.453
I'm Batman.

11:07.454 --> 11:09.372
Hmm. That'd be cool.

11:09.373 --> 11:11.007
<i>...the strangest thing
happened.</i>

11:15.929 --> 11:18.214
I need your help.

11:18.215 --> 11:19.215
Just to warn you.

11:19.216 --> 11:20.466
What I'm about

11:20.467 --> 11:23.019
to show you is not
a hundred percent legal.

11:23.020 --> 11:26.139
Wasn't expecting bunnies.

11:26.140 --> 11:27.557
I stole them, Ted.

11:27.558 --> 11:29.309
My animal rights group
liberated these guys

11:29.310 --> 11:30.926
from an evil cosmetics company.

11:30.927 --> 11:33.262
And I figured,
"Hey, Ted's a vet.

11:33.263 --> 11:35.648
He can check them out
and make sure they're okay."

11:35.649 --> 11:38.818
Absolutely. Just let me run up
and get my bag of vet supplies.

11:38.819 --> 11:40.236
Okay.

11:40.237 --> 11:43.122
Why would I say that?

11:43.123 --> 11:45.375
Well, I know what I'm getting.

11:45.376 --> 11:47.243
Oh? Oh?
The porterhouse.

11:47.244 --> 11:48.578
I've had it here before.

11:48.579 --> 11:51.414
It is like this. It's huge.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.050
Well, spare no expense, buddy.

11:54.051 --> 11:55.752
Dinner is on me,
and-and get dessert.

11:55.753 --> 11:57.920
Maybe this molten chocolate
lava cake?

11:57.921 --> 11:59.639
I just want you to be happy.

12:00.474 --> 12:01.624
Thanks, man.

12:01.625 --> 12:03.393
Next time, it is on me.
Aw.

12:03.394 --> 12:05.311
- Excuse me. I'll be right back. All right. 
- Totally.

12:05.312 --> 12:07.597
We'll just be here.

12:10.267 --> 12:13.019
You're great.

12:13.020 --> 12:14.987
Ah. Thanks, bro.

12:14.988 --> 12:17.440
It's, uh.... it's
going on a while.

12:17.441 --> 12:18.941
I know.

12:18.942 --> 12:21.027
Thanks.

12:21.028 --> 12:22.578
Damn, baby, be cool!

12:22.579 --> 12:23.830
You're acting like

12:23.831 --> 12:25.198
he has six months to live.

12:25.199 --> 12:26.582
It's your fault!

12:26.583 --> 12:28.868
You ladies
and your salty sailor talk!

12:28.869 --> 12:31.871
Oh, come on! What about you men
and your locker room talk?

12:31.872 --> 12:32.988
Locker room talk.

12:32.989 --> 12:34.540
Do you want to know
what it's like

12:34.541 --> 12:35.675
in a men's locker room?

12:35.676 --> 12:37.093
Hey.
Hey.

12:37.094 --> 12:39.879
It's just a bunch
of uncomfortable dudes

12:39.880 --> 12:42.598
<i>trying to get out of there
as quickly as possible.</i>

12:42.599 --> 12:46.285
<i>And one old guy
just letting it all hang out.</i>

12:46.286 --> 12:47.720
Are you suggesting

12:47.721 --> 12:49.472
that guys don't talk about sex?

12:49.473 --> 12:52.058
Yes, we do,
but you know what we say?

12:52.059 --> 12:53.476
<i>"I hit that."</i>

12:53.477 --> 12:54.777
<i>"I got some."</i>

12:54.778 --> 12:55.978
<i>"I tapped it."</i>

12:55.979 --> 12:57.613
<i>"I squeezed those."</i>

12:57.614 --> 12:58.865
Discreet and efficient.

12:58.866 --> 13:00.400
Not to mention classy.

13:00.401 --> 13:01.901
Thank God that I'm not dating.

13:01.902 --> 13:04.353
If I thought that Lily talked
in that much detail

13:04.354 --> 13:06.572
about our sex life,
I'd probably kill myself.

13:10.077 --> 13:12.412
Oh, no.

13:12.413 --> 13:13.863
What did you tell her?

13:13.864 --> 13:15.248
Oh, nothing.

13:15.249 --> 13:17.383
We don't talk about you!

13:17.384 --> 13:19.168
Are you sure?

13:19.169 --> 13:23.723
Yeah. That argument
has no traction whatsoever.

13:25.058 --> 13:27.343
You just broke in
and stole these guys?

13:27.344 --> 13:28.895
Aren't you worried
about getting arrested?

13:28.896 --> 13:31.264
Nah. I've been arrested
lots of times.

13:33.000 --> 13:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:41.942 --> 13:44.527
Chinese Democracy.

13:44.528 --> 13:45.778
Wow.

13:45.779 --> 13:48.080
You're a little bit crazy.

13:48.081 --> 13:50.917
Well, I'm usually crazy
for a good cause.

13:50.918 --> 13:53.453
I can't just sit by while
voiceless people or animals,

13:53.454 --> 13:55.171
or even buildings
get screwed over.

13:55.172 --> 13:57.256
I'm certainly not going
to just sit by

13:57.257 --> 14:00.760
while GNB turns The Arcadian
into a soulless metal box.

14:00.761 --> 14:02.178
Yeah. Yeah.

14:02.179 --> 14:04.280
Although I hear there's
a lovely rooftop patio

14:04.281 --> 14:06.716
where folks can enjoy a
nice bag lunch, so...

14:06.717 --> 14:10.586
Ted, I will find the bastards
at GNB responsible for this,

14:10.587 --> 14:12.254
and I promise you,

14:12.255 --> 14:15.641
I will take them down.

14:16.610 --> 14:18.611
Cuckoo!

14:18.612 --> 14:20.613
Ted, this woman is an anarchist,

14:20.614 --> 14:23.065
a sociopath, a lunatic,

14:23.066 --> 14:26.319
and for the love of God, boobs?!

14:26.320 --> 14:27.987
Solid C-cup, perky bounce.

14:27.988 --> 14:29.822
Momentary grudging respect.

14:32.125 --> 14:33.876
Zoey does
what she believes is right,

14:33.877 --> 14:35.628
and I want to do the same thing.

14:35.629 --> 14:38.113
We have to find a new site
for this building.

14:38.114 --> 14:39.832
Ted, that is never gonna happen.

14:39.833 --> 14:42.251
Well, I can't tear down
The Arcadian.

14:42.252 --> 14:44.337
I'm sorry,
but I'm off the project.

14:45.288 --> 14:47.139
Hey, guys!

14:47.140 --> 14:48.290
I appreciate the great turnout,

14:48.291 --> 14:50.459
but just so we're all
on the same page,

14:50.460 --> 14:53.095
this is not a rally
to legalize marijuana.

14:53.096 --> 14:55.264
Oh, bummer!

14:58.352 --> 14:59.769
Hey.

14:59.770 --> 15:00.987
Hey, Ted.

15:00.988 --> 15:02.805
I'm so glad you came.

15:02.806 --> 15:04.974
Well, you really got
to me the other night.

15:04.975 --> 15:07.610
I want to get involved
with "Save The Arcadian."

15:07.611 --> 15:09.946
Great. I'll grab
you a picket sign.

15:09.947 --> 15:11.247
Hmm.

15:11.248 --> 15:15.418
<i>Do you want "GNB puts the
douche in fiduciary..""</i>

15:16.787 --> 15:18.871
...or "It's always 4:20
somewhere"?

15:18.872 --> 15:21.591
Dudes, you forgot your signs!

15:21.592 --> 15:24.594
As I looked up at that
magnificent old structure,

15:24.595 --> 15:27.763
<i>I realized I wasn't letting my
feelings for Zoey mislead me.</i>

15:27.764 --> 15:30.216
<i>This building really was
worth saving.</i>

15:35.606 --> 15:36.939
Ted, everything okay?

15:36.940 --> 15:39.125
Yea... um... um...

15:42.312 --> 15:45.347
You work for GNB?

15:47.868 --> 15:50.152
Dude, why are you dressed
like a wizard?

15:50.153 --> 15:52.738
She was really hot, okay?

16:02.621 --> 16:03.888
How the hell could you do that?

16:03.889 --> 16:05.922
Simple. I rented the chair.

16:06.023 --> 16:07.857
The bunny was here already.
That was lucky.

16:07.858 --> 16:09.509
I waited
to do the dramatic swivel

16:09.510 --> 16:10.394
until I heard your key
enter the door.

16:10.395 --> 16:11.729
The billboard, Barney.

16:11.730 --> 16:14.231
I had to. Now that you have
no shot with the girl,

16:14.232 --> 16:15.900
you'll realize you never cared
about the building,

16:15.901 --> 16:17.451
and everything can go back
to normal.

16:17.452 --> 16:19.403
<i>You're wrong. I do care.</i>

16:19.404 --> 16:20.988
And I'm still quitting.

16:20.989 --> 16:22.323
Don't you get it, Ted?

16:22.324 --> 16:24.575
We're tearing down The
Arcadian either way.

16:24.576 --> 16:28.245
It's a stupid old piece-of-crap,
run-down, snake-infested dump!

16:28.246 --> 16:30.197
Okay, are there
or aren't there snakes?!

16:30.198 --> 16:31.799
Who mentioned snakes?!

16:31.800 --> 16:33.384
And stop shouting!

16:33.385 --> 16:35.720
You're scaring Cottontail.

16:35.721 --> 16:36.921
You named the rabbit?

16:36.922 --> 16:39.090
You took longer to get here
than I thought,

16:39.091 --> 16:40.257
we bonded, I'm keeping her.

16:40.258 --> 16:41.592
The point is,

16:41.593 --> 16:43.594
you now have a chance

16:43.595 --> 16:45.596
to design your own building.

16:45.597 --> 16:46.713
Dude,

16:46.714 --> 16:48.516
you can do
whatever you want with it.

16:48.517 --> 16:50.034
You're right.

16:50.035 --> 16:52.953
You're right. I can
design it however I want.

16:52.954 --> 16:54.822
So you're back in?

16:54.823 --> 16:57.358
Yeah.

16:57.359 --> 16:59.944
That night, as I
worked on a new design

16:59.945 --> 17:02.580
<i>that just might solve
all my problems...</i>

17:05.450 --> 17:08.035
<i>...Marshall was visited
by a disturbing vision.</i>

17:08.036 --> 17:10.421
Ugh, he thinks I like this...

17:10.422 --> 17:12.873
But it feels disgusting.

17:12.874 --> 17:15.626
<i>Uh, it looks disgusting.</i>

17:15.627 --> 17:17.261
Um...

17:17.262 --> 17:19.380
Uh, is this working for you?

17:19.381 --> 17:20.931
"Uh, is this
working for you?"

17:20.932 --> 17:22.183
Oh, of course,

17:22.184 --> 17:24.351
because what woman doesn't
like being slobbered on

17:24.352 --> 17:26.604
while some giant paws
at her nether regions

17:26.605 --> 17:29.557
<i>like Lenny from
Of Mice and Men?</i>

17:29.558 --> 17:31.091
Oh, you're bad.

17:31.092 --> 17:32.276
More Cosmos?

17:32.277 --> 17:33.427
Mm.

17:33.428 --> 17:34.779
I can't... I
can't do this!

17:34.780 --> 17:36.647
I can't stop thinking
about you and Robin!

17:36.648 --> 17:38.482
Oh, I've had that
a couple times.

17:38.483 --> 17:41.368
Just lean into it
and let it fuel things.

17:41.369 --> 17:42.536
Look, no. You know what?

17:42.537 --> 17:44.572
Why don't you just...
Why don't you just

17:44.573 --> 17:48.159
call Robin, okay,
and have a good laugh about it?

17:49.961 --> 17:51.245
Whoa!

17:51.246 --> 17:54.131
Traction could have
prevented that.

17:57.385 --> 17:59.503
Well,

17:59.504 --> 18:02.706
hope you don't mind, we made
some changes to the billboard.

18:06.144 --> 18:08.596
Well, that explains
a few voicemails.

18:08.597 --> 18:11.599
Listen, Zoey, I think
we can save The Arcadian.

18:11.600 --> 18:12.683
No. Maybe not

18:12.684 --> 18:14.101
in the way you were picturing,

18:14.102 --> 18:15.436
but I stayed up all night

18:15.437 --> 18:17.304
working on a new
concept, all right?

18:17.305 --> 18:19.156
What if my design
could incorporate

18:19.157 --> 18:20.441
The Arcadian's facade

18:20.442 --> 18:22.026
into the new GNB headquarters?

18:22.027 --> 18:24.829
Kids, it was one
of those moments in life

18:24.830 --> 18:26.413
<i>where everything
comes together...</i>

18:26.414 --> 18:32.419
<i>the girl, the building,
everything, until...</i>

18:32.420 --> 18:34.371
Are you married?
Yeah.

18:34.372 --> 18:38.375
So you were saying, the facade
will be completely preserved?

18:41.763 --> 18:43.097
This isn't about the girl.

18:43.098 --> 18:44.682
It's about the building.

18:44.683 --> 18:47.017
Yeah, it was about the girl.

18:47.018 --> 18:50.170
Ted, wh-wh-what are you doing?

18:50.171 --> 18:51.555
This wouldn't work.

18:51.556 --> 18:53.858
Zoey, The Arcadian was
a really great building once,

18:53.859 --> 18:56.009
but it's falling apart,
and it's full of snakes.

18:56.010 --> 18:57.895
Snakes?
I don't recall saying snakes.

18:59.447 --> 19:02.316
Then he gets this panicked look
on his face, says,

19:02.317 --> 19:04.618
"I can't do this,"
and storms out.

19:04.619 --> 19:05.903
Wow, that is weird.

19:05.904 --> 19:08.072
But here's the crazier part.

19:08.073 --> 19:09.957
No. You know what?

19:09.958 --> 19:12.025
Papa don't back down
from a fight.

19:12.026 --> 19:15.829
So why don't you tell Robin...
about this!

19:17.632 --> 19:20.000
It was amazing.

19:20.001 --> 19:23.003
He was passionate, animalistic,

19:23.004 --> 19:24.972
a complete stud.

19:24.973 --> 19:26.340
Wow.

19:26.341 --> 19:29.059
So he's right there
making you say all this, huh?

19:29.060 --> 19:32.313
Yup. "'You're like
a Greek god,'

19:32.314 --> 19:34.214
I moaned, as the..."

19:34.215 --> 19:35.882
I can't read that, baby.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.068
"Musky scent of man."

19:38.069 --> 19:40.738
"As the musky scent of man

19:40.739 --> 19:46.660
"and Marshall's sure-footed
traction intoxicated

19:46.661 --> 19:47.894
and overpowered me."

19:47.895 --> 19:49.029
That sounds real.

19:49.030 --> 19:51.031
And as for Zoey, it was funny.

19:51.032 --> 19:53.250
<i>I'd lied to her,
then completely let her down.</i>

19:53.251 --> 19:54.735
<i>And I barely knew the girl.</i>

19:54.736 --> 19:56.403
<i>But there was something
about her.</i>

19:56.404 --> 19:59.390
<i>I couldn't help but wonder
if I'd ever see her again.</i>

19:59.391 --> 20:01.542
Hey, Mosby!

20:01.543 --> 20:03.494
You're gonna have

20:03.495 --> 20:07.097
to come out of your hole at
some point, you son of a bitch!

20:07.098 --> 20:08.349
Yeah!

20:08.350 --> 20:09.717
Legalize it!

20:09.718 --> 20:11.352
Dude!

20:11.353 --> 20:12.753
Ready.

20:12.754 --> 20:14.054
Aim.

20:14.055 --> 20:15.556
Fire!

20:15.557 --> 20:17.591
Why, yes.

20:17.592 --> 20:20.527
<i>Yes, I would see her again.</i>

20:23.414 --> 20:25.147
Hey. Hey.
Hey.

20:25.848 --> 20:27.182
How's it going with Robin?

20:27.183 --> 20:30.536
Uh, I think
I have to break up with her.

20:30.537 --> 20:32.621
Really? Why?
You with her?

20:32.622 --> 20:35.507
Yeah, well, there's this...

20:35.508 --> 20:45.751
kind of weird thing she likes
to do in the bedroom.

20:45.752 --> 20:47.920
Hey, what's not for everyone?

20:49.422 --> 20:51.706
Guys, come on.
What is it?

20:51.707 --> 20:53.041
Come on, bro.

20:53.042 --> 20:55.260
This is a locker room.

20:56.146 --> 20:58.430
I...

21:00.817 --> 21:02.717
What do you think
it was, Murray?
