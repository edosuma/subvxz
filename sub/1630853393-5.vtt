WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:09.592
You think there's a chance
Elliott might be innocent?

00:09.676 --> 00:11.970
In my business,
that would be what we call a unicorn.

00:12.053 --> 00:13.304
You ever had one before?

00:13.388 --> 00:16.182
<i>Jesús Menendez.</i>
<i>He's doing 15 years for murder.</i>

00:16.266 --> 00:19.686
A witness disappeared on me.
Without her, he was looking at life.

00:19.769 --> 00:22.355
The court finds
Mr. Soto is a flight risk.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.357
Bail will be set at $2 million.

00:24.441 --> 00:26.234
<i>Get here right away.</i>
<i>It's your witness.</i>

00:26.317 --> 00:27.610
<i>It's my fault.</i>

00:27.694 --> 00:29.946
He didn't wanna do it,
and I pressured him.

00:30.030 --> 00:33.074
Come here. It's okay.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.160
No, you did everything you could.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.122
-I should, um…
-Yeah.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.166
I don't know
what the Feds spoke to Jerry about.

00:41.249 --> 00:43.501
Couple days ago, my assistant told me

00:43.585 --> 00:46.296
there's over a hundred grand
missing from his accounts.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.882
Now we got
two other people to point the finger at?

00:48.965 --> 00:50.717
Neema Shavar.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.844
She was giving money
to this guy, Rilz, too.

00:52.927 --> 00:56.973
And she has a husband.
He runs a private security company.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.642
<i>Trevor,</i>
<i>jury selection starts Wednesday.</i>

00:59.726 --> 01:04.064
The 12 citizens will decide if you spend
the rest of your life in prison or not.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.024
<i>Once we pick a jury,</i>
<i>there's no turning back.</i>

01:06.107 --> 01:08.193
Clear your calendar. We have work to do.

01:26.920 --> 01:27.837
Thanks.

01:28.963 --> 01:30.256
No. This is me.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.301
Okay, I get it.

01:33.384 --> 01:36.471
You brought me here
to take me down a peg. Is that it?

01:36.554 --> 01:38.515
Rich guy only eats at Nobu.

01:39.349 --> 01:42.102
I make video games.
You think I never had Pink's before?

01:42.185 --> 01:44.896
I brought you here
because I wanted a chili dog.

01:44.979 --> 01:46.940
And another reason, too.

01:47.023 --> 01:48.399
Look around you, Trevor.

01:49.567 --> 01:51.277
This is your jury pool.

01:51.861 --> 01:54.656
My father
used to call the jury the Gods of Guilt

01:54.739 --> 01:56.908
because at the end of the day,
they decide.

01:56.991 --> 01:59.911
You might think your trial
starts with the opening statement.

01:59.994 --> 02:03.039
It doesn't.
It starts tomorrow with jury selection.

02:03.123 --> 02:07.001
With them. Every single one
of them will scrutinize you

02:07.085 --> 02:08.628
as soon as you park at the courthouse.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.296
They will judge what you drive,

02:10.380 --> 02:12.590
how you dress,
every single expression you make.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.885
-So, please don't make any.
-I really can't drive my own car?

02:16.803 --> 02:19.556
The one that costs five times
what your jurors make in a year?

02:21.266 --> 02:23.309
Lara's Prius is still in the garage.

02:23.393 --> 02:24.477
Good.

02:24.561 --> 02:25.478
Okay, what else?

02:26.646 --> 02:27.647
From you, nothing.

02:28.731 --> 02:31.317
We've got the best
jury consultants in town.

02:31.401 --> 02:32.652
They charge accordingly.

02:33.570 --> 02:36.865
-Just sign this agreement.
-I don't want a jury consultant.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.867
What? Why?

02:38.950 --> 02:41.202
You remember
the last celebrity trial you saw?

02:41.286 --> 02:44.414
People see a rich guy
hiding behind a wall of suits,

02:44.497 --> 02:46.457
they automatically think you're guilty.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.376
I know how to read people, Mickey.

02:48.459 --> 02:50.962
I know what they like.
That's how I got where I am.

02:51.754 --> 02:55.425
I trust my own instincts and yours,
not some consultant I never met.

02:55.508 --> 02:59.304
I appreciate the confidence, Trevor,
but we need all the help we can get,

02:59.387 --> 03:00.722
so please just sign here.

03:01.306 --> 03:02.432
Let me be clear.

03:03.516 --> 03:04.767
No jury consultant.

03:16.905 --> 03:20.074
-What are we doin' here?
-Trevor doesn't want a jury consultant.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.286
-So?
-So I'm not hiring one.

03:32.253 --> 03:34.255
-'Sup, Haller?
-'Sup, Bubba? She here?

03:56.319 --> 03:57.153
Call.

03:59.155 --> 04:02.242
The chances somebody
doesn't have a full house are not good.

04:20.927 --> 04:21.761
Ten thousand.

04:24.222 --> 04:25.056
All in.

04:30.019 --> 04:31.062
Call.

04:40.613 --> 04:43.408
Kings full. Caught it on a river.

04:43.491 --> 04:45.994
Sorry, big baby. Four of a kind.

04:49.622 --> 04:50.456
Straight flush.

04:53.209 --> 04:54.085
Fuck.

05:06.556 --> 05:07.807
Mickey Haller.

05:09.058 --> 05:11.185
Hey, stranger, it's been a while.

05:12.061 --> 05:13.980
Trying to live the clean life.

05:14.063 --> 05:15.189
Yeah, you and me both.

05:16.733 --> 05:20.153
Listen, uh,
I need your help on a murder trial.

05:20.236 --> 05:23.281
I just made more on one hand
than you can pay me in a week.

05:23.364 --> 05:24.365
I know.

05:24.449 --> 05:27.660
I also know reading people
is a skill that has to be practiced.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.705
I'm just giving you
the opportunity to do what you do best.

05:31.497 --> 05:32.540
Hmm.

05:32.623 --> 05:34.292
You always were a sweet talker.

05:35.626 --> 05:36.711
I can give you a day.

05:36.794 --> 05:39.047
Fair enough. I'll text you the details.

05:39.130 --> 05:42.091
Just one thing, my client can't know.

05:43.926 --> 05:45.636
Well, I'm nothing if not discreet.

06:05.782 --> 06:08.576
<i>You've reached Maggie McPherson.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

06:09.243 --> 06:11.788
-Hey, Mags, it's me.

06:13.247 --> 06:16.334
Look, I'm really sorry about your witness.

06:18.169 --> 06:21.297
And, uh, I'm sorry
how we left things last night.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.842
Anyway, I'll try you later. Okay?

06:25.468 --> 06:26.469
Bye.

06:34.018 --> 06:37.105
<i>Janelle Simmons</i>
<i>has made women in Los Angeles less safe.</i>

06:37.188 --> 06:39.065
<i>As chief of the Major Crimes Unit,</i>

06:39.148 --> 06:41.776
<i>she stood by</i>
<i>while an overburdened laboratory</i>

06:41.859 --> 06:44.654
<i>neglected rape kits, and tainted evidence.</i>

06:44.737 --> 06:47.740
<i>Her negligence victimized women again.</i>

06:47.824 --> 06:50.910
<i>When you needed her,</i>
<i>Janelle Simmons didn't do her job.</i>

06:50.993 --> 06:53.704
<i>Vote Robert Cardone for district attorney.</i>

06:53.788 --> 06:56.457
<i>I'm Bob Cardone</i>
<i>and I approve this message.</i>

06:57.333 --> 06:59.961
Every crime lab
in the country is backed up.

07:00.044 --> 07:02.046
And he's in charge of conviction review.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.841
He's just milking this
to make me look bad.

07:05.883 --> 07:08.803
Right now,
every case needs to be airtight.

07:08.886 --> 07:10.847
Well, we are airtight, Janelle.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.723
Your lead witness is dead.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.643
Because Angelo Soto had him killed.

07:15.726 --> 07:17.895
I am under a microscope here, Maggie.

07:17.979 --> 07:20.314
Without your witness,
the case falls apart.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.233
We have his testimony from the grand jury.

07:22.316 --> 07:25.069
Which you can't use
if defense can't cross-examine him.

07:25.153 --> 07:28.072
-They'll move to dismiss and win.
-Not if we prove Soto killed him.

07:28.156 --> 07:30.992
We do that,
the grand jury testimony comes back in.

07:31.075 --> 07:32.326
Can you?

07:32.410 --> 07:34.996
If you can prove
that Soto was behind this, do it.

07:35.913 --> 07:38.958
Or we need to drop the charges
before it gets to a hearing.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.544
-Wait, what?
-You heard me, Maggie.

07:42.211 --> 07:43.045
Airtight.

07:53.347 --> 07:55.850
Track anyone with ties to government.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.978
Family in the military, contractors.

08:00.688 --> 08:02.190
We want rule followers.

08:02.273 --> 08:03.691
This is it, right here.

08:03.774 --> 08:05.526
You know, anyone's who's…

08:21.167 --> 08:23.211
His name is Anton Shavar.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.422
This is the guy
with the private security firm?

08:27.340 --> 08:29.509
Arms dealers, oligarchs.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.637
He's not particular
about where his clients get their money.

08:33.346 --> 08:37.099
Supposedly, he's ex-Mossad,
but that may just be PR.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.435
Sorry, I know
I'm only here 'cause there's donuts,

08:39.519 --> 08:42.230
but how does this all
tie in with Trevor Elliott?

08:42.313 --> 08:44.857
Don't apologize.
That's exactly what the jury will ask.

08:44.941 --> 08:45.775
So…

08:48.319 --> 08:52.823
Elliott's wife was found dead
with this guy, Jan Rilz.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.409
-The yoga gigolo.
-That's about the size of it.

08:55.993 --> 08:58.704
Rilz was sleeping
with a bunch of his female clients.

08:58.788 --> 09:03.584
Mostly wealthy, mostly married.
Like Neema Shavar, Anton's wife.

09:04.168 --> 09:05.086
Now ex-wife.

09:05.169 --> 09:07.588
It's called the
"it could have been this guy" defense.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.007
-Mmm.
-Anton's potentially dangerous.

09:10.091 --> 09:13.344
He's got a motive. Got anything else
I can use to point a finger at him?

09:13.427 --> 09:14.428
Yes and no.

09:14.512 --> 09:15.346
Okay.

09:17.181 --> 09:21.018
Rilz filed
a restraining order against Anton

09:21.102 --> 09:22.937
two months before the murders.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.690
He said Anton
came to his house and threatened him.

09:25.773 --> 09:26.691
Now we're talking.

09:26.774 --> 09:29.569
So, you said, "Yes, and no." What's no?

09:29.652 --> 09:32.863
Rilz never showed up
for the hearing. The order wasn't granted.

09:32.947 --> 09:36.200
How did you find out about it?
Never mind, I don't wanna know.

09:36.284 --> 09:40.121
If Anton's violent, maybe he threatened
Rilz into dropping the restraining order.

09:40.204 --> 09:42.206
That's smart, but we can't prove it.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.250
Not that he threatened him,

09:45.084 --> 09:47.503
but there may be
a way to show that he's violent.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.423
And you definitely don't wanna know.

09:52.174 --> 09:53.926
All right. Surprise me, Cisco.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.721
Just make it quick.
We pick a jury tomorrow. You ready?

09:56.804 --> 09:58.055
Mmm.

10:02.059 --> 10:02.893
Cheers.

10:04.395 --> 10:05.438
-Mick.
-Yeah?

10:05.521 --> 10:06.564
Where you going?

10:06.647 --> 10:09.358
I got one more thing
I gotta do before tomorrow. Old business.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.944
Anything to do
with the Jesús Menendez case?

10:14.113 --> 10:16.449
You asked me
to get you a file, out of nowhere,

10:16.532 --> 10:18.826
for a case that got put to bed a year ago.

10:18.909 --> 10:22.038
Did it? 'Cause it's eating at me, Lorna.
It was driving me crazy.

10:22.121 --> 10:24.415
-Mick…
-Just forget it for now, okay?

10:24.498 --> 10:27.627
Did you at least get Trevor
to sign off on the jury consultant?

10:27.710 --> 10:29.587
Not exactly, no. Goodbye, Lorna.

10:30.212 --> 10:33.799
The one who's
driving me crazy is you. My God.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.287
Knock-knock.

11:06.624 --> 11:10.294
-You motherfucker.
-Wait, Cherry. Let me explain.

11:11.253 --> 11:14.298
You tricked me. I took two buses
to get here from Hollywood.

11:14.382 --> 11:17.510
-Sorry. You wouldn't meet me otherwise.
-We had a deal.

11:17.593 --> 11:20.721
I was looking for Glory Days.
You're gonna get me off that drug charge.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.557
I know. I'm sorry. I ended up in rehab.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.018
An accident, shit went from bad to worse.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.729
I did two months in County
because you ghosted me.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.357
Wait, you went to rehab?

11:31.941 --> 11:34.402
Yeah, I don't wanna get into it.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.570
Don't stand there waving cash in my face.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.572
If you're here
to make it right, make it right.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.910
Cherry, I'm here
because I really need your help

11:42.993 --> 11:44.370
finding Glory Days again.

11:46.455 --> 11:49.917
Maybe you should've paid her more.
You're not exactly Mr. Big Spender.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.838
There's more of that if you can help me.
When was the last time you saw her?

11:54.672 --> 11:56.173
Not since last time you asked.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.759
Her profile's been dark.
She's not working parties.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.970
A girl doesn't disappear without a trace.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.763
-She got cold feet.
-On what?

12:02.847 --> 12:05.558
I don't know.
She was my key witness in a murder trial.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.853
Where would you go for work
if you had to start fresh?

12:10.604 --> 12:12.064
The world is my oyster.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.776
Look, if you wanna
pay me to chase a ghost,

12:15.860 --> 12:17.069
I'm not complaining.

12:17.695 --> 12:20.030
But instead of a down payment,

12:21.657 --> 12:23.951
maybe I can earn the rest of it right now,

12:24.702 --> 12:26.162
help you forget about her?

12:27.580 --> 12:29.498
Enjoy the room for another 50 minutes.

12:30.666 --> 12:33.961
Take a bath.
Watch some cable. Keep me posted.

12:34.044 --> 12:35.087
Mmm-hmm.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.319
What the hell is that doing?

12:58.402 --> 13:01.238
Mapping the place.
That way he knows where everything is,

13:01.322 --> 13:03.324
so he doesn't bump into things.

13:03.407 --> 13:05.117
-"He"?
-Mr. Geary.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.995
He was our custodian in middle school.

13:08.078 --> 13:09.205
He was so nice.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.916
'Course.
Don't we have a janitor to do that?

13:11.999 --> 13:15.127
The service has been
a little spotty since the whole gun thing.

13:16.796 --> 13:20.382
Look at you! My man can sew.

13:21.592 --> 13:23.052
Well, I'm an Eagle Scout.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.261
Hmm.

13:24.345 --> 13:27.264
Look, I know you're
onto something with this Anton guy,

13:27.348 --> 13:29.558
but you should look into this one.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.893
Carol Dubois.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.353
The insurance lady?

13:33.187 --> 13:34.230
I already did, babe.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.690
She has got an alibi.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.776
She was at some conference in Tucson.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.903
Unless you think she hired a triggerman

13:40.986 --> 13:43.364
'cause she was upset
about losing 25 grand.

13:43.447 --> 13:46.325
No, it wasn't about the money.
She didn't care about that.

13:47.284 --> 13:48.244
It was Rilz.

13:50.079 --> 13:53.249
Alibi or no alibi,
there is something off about her.

13:53.332 --> 13:55.334
I'm telling you, it's the women.

13:56.377 --> 13:57.670
Mmm.

13:57.753 --> 14:00.714
<i>Hello and welcome to jury duty.</i>

14:00.798 --> 14:05.052
<i>I'm Mary Holder, presiding judge</i>
<i>of the Los Angeles Superior Court.</i>

14:05.135 --> 14:09.265
<i>And as I like to say,</i>
<i>there is no justice without you.</i>

14:12.768 --> 14:15.479
<i>But let's talk about how you got here.</i>

14:15.563 --> 14:20.526
<i>It all begins in the Jury Services office,</i>
<i>when your name was randomly generated</i>

14:20.609 --> 14:24.029
<i>from voter registration rolls</i>
<i>and other public sources.</i>

14:26.031 --> 14:28.200
How come
whenever I get called for jury duty

14:28.284 --> 14:30.744
it's at some court
on the other side of town?

14:30.828 --> 14:33.956
Because they assign jurors
randomly from all over the county.

14:34.039 --> 14:38.335
That way, you get a diverse jury pool.
That's the theory anyway.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.837
What's the reality?

14:39.920 --> 14:42.923
The reality is,
it doesn't matter where they come from,

14:43.007 --> 14:47.219
almost none of 'em wanna be there,
but your entire case depends on them.

14:54.685 --> 14:57.855
-These are the people deciding my fate?
-Yep, and they start right now.

14:57.938 --> 15:00.941
Don't say anything.
Don't smile. Keep your head down.

15:01.025 --> 15:03.193
What do you think
I've been doing the last six months?

15:03.277 --> 15:06.155
Literally. Cameras can whip around
and cause a concussion.

15:06.238 --> 15:08.449
-Haller!
-All right, Lorna. Come on.

15:08.532 --> 15:11.911
DA says the evidence
against your client is overwhelming.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.746
What evidence? What evidence?

15:13.829 --> 15:15.915
They have no murder weapon, no witnesses,

15:15.998 --> 15:18.250
not one drop of blood
on my client's clothes.

15:18.334 --> 15:21.962
The only thing overwhelming
is Mr. Elliott's innocence.

15:22.046 --> 15:23.005
Please excuse us.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.424
-Mr. Haller, the DA evidence…

15:25.507 --> 15:28.594
<i>Voir dire.</i> That's what
they call jury selection, right?

15:28.677 --> 15:29.637
Mmm.

15:30.971 --> 15:33.307
That's French, means to speak the truth.

15:35.809 --> 15:36.644
What?

15:37.436 --> 15:41.106
The truth is the least of my concerns.
I don't want fair-minded jurors.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.984
I want them biased as hell. Biased for me.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.778
I want 12 lemmings in a box.

15:46.403 --> 15:48.906
And the DA wants the exact same thing.

15:48.989 --> 15:53.911
So I try to get rid of his lemmings
and he tries to get rid of mine.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.537
That's how you pick a jury.

15:57.831 --> 16:00.209
Hey, you handled
the press like a pro out there.

16:00.292 --> 16:01.377
It's part of the job.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.505
Case as big as this,
you can't get many of those.

16:04.588 --> 16:06.298
Once you get through those doors,

16:06.382 --> 16:08.926
it's just another homicide.
Nothing I haven't seen before.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.765
This is gonna move fast
once the jurors come in.

16:14.848 --> 16:18.227
I'll input the basics right away.
Age, ethnicity, flesh it out as we go.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.483
Colored pens and post-its, is he for real?

16:25.651 --> 16:27.528
You know they make software for that.

16:27.611 --> 16:29.989
A computer
can't hear how somebody answers.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.574
-It can't read their eyes.
-They can now, actually.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.418
<i>Go get 'em, tiger.</i>

16:47.798 --> 16:50.426
Relax, I've picked dozens of jurors.

16:50.509 --> 16:51.593
You're in good hands.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.595
I read about how this works.

16:54.179 --> 16:57.641
Once they take their seats,
they're on the jury unless they get cut.

16:57.725 --> 17:01.395
That's right. My job is
to figure out who to cut, who to keep.

17:02.563 --> 17:03.397
Our job.

17:05.649 --> 17:07.776
This isn't some video game launch, Trevor.

17:07.860 --> 17:10.404
This is my domain.
Just leave it to me, okay?

17:10.487 --> 17:11.363
And it's my life.

17:11.447 --> 17:13.574
I'd like some input
into the people deciding it.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.119
I built my brand on trusting my instincts.

17:17.202 --> 17:20.664
I don't want you cutting anyone
unless we make that decision together.

17:23.208 --> 17:26.295
All rise.
The honorable Judge Stanton presiding.

17:30.591 --> 17:31.842
Be seated.

17:32.509 --> 17:35.262
Wanna weigh in? Fine.
But just be quiet and brief.

17:35.345 --> 17:37.139
If the jury sees us arguing, you're dead.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.642
All right, let's bring in the first 18.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.604
Thank you for being here.

17:43.687 --> 17:47.316
I'm going to ask you some questions,
then the lawyers will have a turn.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.817
There are no wrong answers.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.861
Your only obligation is to be truthful.

17:50.944 --> 17:54.740
Now, due to the media attention,
this will be an anonymous jury.

17:54.823 --> 17:57.159
Attorneys haven't
been provided with your identities.

17:57.242 --> 17:59.995
If you slip up
and say anything that identifies you,

18:00.079 --> 18:02.372
I will be forced to excuse you myself.

18:03.290 --> 18:04.291
Any questions?

18:05.375 --> 18:07.878
Good. Let's start with some basics.

18:07.961 --> 18:09.755
Juror number one, tell us your occupation,

18:09.838 --> 18:11.632
marital status, and where you live.

18:12.382 --> 18:17.012
I'm a stay-at-home mom
with two kids in high school, divorced.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.806
I live in Woodland Hills.

18:18.889 --> 18:21.350
I'm a writer, technical manuals mostly.

18:21.433 --> 18:25.062
I'm engaged so,
sort of married, Culver City.

18:25.145 --> 18:27.356
I'm an attorney. I am divorced.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.900
No kids, I live in Los Feliz.

18:32.486 --> 18:34.947
I'm an aerospace engineer
at Lockheed Martin.

18:35.030 --> 18:37.491
I'm single and I live in Palos Verdes.

18:38.742 --> 18:41.620
I'm a caterer,
married with three kids in Altadena.

18:42.287 --> 18:44.790
I do weddings, buddy.
Give you a juror's discount.

18:44.873 --> 18:46.166
I'm an artist.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.418
I just moved to Silver Lake from Ohio.

18:48.502 --> 18:49.336
I'm single.

18:49.419 --> 18:52.131
I'm a graduate student
and a rideshare driver.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.758
Van Nuys. Not married, no.

18:54.842 --> 18:57.219
My name's Janice. I'm a stand-up comedian.

18:58.178 --> 19:00.848
I'm sorry.
I wasn't supposed to say my name, was I?

19:03.058 --> 19:04.810
Juror number 12 is excused.

19:05.686 --> 19:06.770
Excuse me.

19:09.606 --> 19:11.817
Good morning. My name is Jeffrey Golantz.

19:11.900 --> 19:12.985
I'm the prosecutor.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.070
This is a murder trial.

19:16.196 --> 19:20.075
The defendant is charged
with murdering his wife and her lover.

19:20.909 --> 19:23.078
Now, we want a fair, impartial jury.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.080
So, I need to ask,

19:25.164 --> 19:28.417
would the fact that the victims
were having an extramarital affair

19:28.500 --> 19:30.919
make it hard
for anyone here to be impartial?

19:36.300 --> 19:38.218
<i>Two, four and 15 are bluffing.</i>

19:38.302 --> 19:39.136
<i>Keep them.</i>

19:40.470 --> 19:44.433
Your Honor, the People thank
and excuse jurors two, four, and 15.

19:45.809 --> 19:47.352
<i>Shit, this guy's good.</i>

19:51.315 --> 19:54.359
See, jury selection
is the one part of a trial that's a game,

19:54.443 --> 19:56.028
and like any game it has rules.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.489
<i>Each side gets ten challenges.</i>

19:59.573 --> 20:03.410
You can use those to strike
any juror you want, but be careful.

20:03.493 --> 20:06.163
Because the replacement
may be even worse, right?

20:06.246 --> 20:09.499
Exactly. So the trick is to hold on
to as many bullets as you can

20:09.583 --> 20:11.919
<i>and get the other side to fire theirs.</i>

20:12.002 --> 20:13.337
<i>Plus, this is your chance</i>

20:13.420 --> 20:16.131
<i>to introduce yourself</i>
<i>and your client to the jury.</i>

20:16.215 --> 20:18.342
<i>Not just as a lawyer or a defendant,</i>

20:18.425 --> 20:21.220
<i>but as human beings. So use it.</i>

20:22.179 --> 20:23.472
Oops.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.350
Off to a rough start, folks.

20:28.977 --> 20:30.312
Thanks.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.522
All right. Good morning, everyone.

20:33.148 --> 20:34.733
My name is Michael Haller.

20:34.816 --> 20:37.152
And this is my client, Trevor Elliott.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.445
I'm the defense attorney

20:38.528 --> 20:42.366
and I'm here to help you find the facts
in this case so we can get to the truth.

20:42.449 --> 20:44.576
Let me tell you a little bit about myself.

20:44.660 --> 20:48.455
I have a daughter, right?
She's 13, and what can I say?

20:48.538 --> 20:50.916
She's got me
wrapped around this little finger.

20:50.999 --> 20:54.002
If I ask her, did you make your bed?

20:54.086 --> 20:56.296
Did you do your homework?
Did you wash the dishes?

20:56.380 --> 20:58.674
She'll say yes,
and I'll want to believe her

20:58.757 --> 21:03.262
even when I can see her unmade bed
or her school bag unopened.

21:03.345 --> 21:04.179
Why?

21:04.972 --> 21:07.474
Well, because
she's my baby girl, you know?

21:08.225 --> 21:09.851
-Anyone with me?
-Yeah.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.144
All right.

21:11.228 --> 21:13.188
Does anyone feel that way about cops?

21:13.897 --> 21:16.608
About people in uniforms
with badges and guns?

21:16.692 --> 21:20.487
You just believe them
even when your eyes are telling you

21:20.570 --> 21:21.947
they're not being truthful?

21:25.867 --> 21:28.745
<i>Number one is bluffing.</i>
<i>Hand to her mouth is a lie.</i>

21:28.829 --> 21:29.705
<i>Dead giveaway.</i>

21:29.788 --> 21:34.084
Does anybody here have relatives
or family members in law enforcement?

21:35.294 --> 21:36.962
How about you, juror number one?

21:37.671 --> 21:38.630
Maybe in the past?

21:40.549 --> 21:44.344
Well, my ex-husband
was a cop in Long Beach.

21:44.428 --> 21:47.681
I mean, he's not a relative
or family member anymore.

21:47.764 --> 21:48.598
How long?

21:48.682 --> 21:49.808
Fifteen years.

21:49.891 --> 21:53.353
What if you wanna get rid of somebody,
but you don't wanna waste a challenge?

21:53.437 --> 21:55.439
You get unlimited strikes
for cause.

21:55.522 --> 21:58.650
And the judge
can kick anybody for being biased.

21:58.734 --> 22:02.362
So you've got to try and bring out
that bias in your questioning.

22:02.446 --> 22:06.158
Usually cops try to stick it out for 20
so they can get their full pension.

22:06.950 --> 22:09.119
Why did your ex leave the force so early?

22:10.579 --> 22:12.831
Because being a cop is a tough job.

22:13.415 --> 22:15.208
He just couldn't do it anymore.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.336
So, there wasn't an incident?

22:18.128 --> 22:19.379
What do you mean?

22:19.463 --> 22:23.091
An allegation
of misconduct like excessive force?

22:23.175 --> 22:25.385
Corruption? Maybe he just cut corners?

22:25.469 --> 22:28.638
Objection, Your Honor,
to the entire line of questioning.

22:28.722 --> 22:30.223
Counsel, approach.

22:33.852 --> 22:36.772
Your Honor, their case rests
entirely on the shoulders of the cops.

22:36.855 --> 22:39.232
I've a right to explore
her feelings on law enforcement.

22:39.316 --> 22:42.903
-You're baiting her.
-I'm drawing out her biases.

22:42.986 --> 22:44.905
You've got ten challenges, Mr. Haller.

22:44.988 --> 22:47.741
You wanna strike her, use one.
I'm not doing it for you.

22:52.579 --> 22:55.540
The defense will like to thank
and excuse juror number one.

23:00.420 --> 23:01.588
Well, that didn't work.

23:02.297 --> 23:04.883
Yes and no. I used a challenge,

23:04.966 --> 23:07.552
but I put the idea
of corrupt cops in their heads.

23:09.513 --> 23:11.306
We need another way
to get to Soto.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.724
What about his girlfriend?

23:13.517 --> 23:16.978
Tanya Cruz, 26. Came over
from the Philippines four years ago.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.271
No record.

23:18.355 --> 23:21.066
No money either,
until Soto started taking care of her.

23:21.149 --> 23:23.902
-Think she knows something?
-It's worth finding out.

23:23.985 --> 23:26.822
If we can turn her,
maybe she can give us the shooter.

23:26.905 --> 23:27.989
How long do we have?

23:28.073 --> 23:29.699
A week, maybe.

23:29.783 --> 23:35.372
They'll file a motion to dismiss today,
ask for an expedited hearing. What?

23:35.455 --> 23:36.581
Nothing, it's just…

23:37.582 --> 23:41.169
Most DAs,
when it gets political, they cut and run.

23:42.921 --> 23:45.715
I'll let that go on account
you've never worked with me before.

23:45.799 --> 23:48.802
Look at you,
making me think twice about lawyers.

23:50.345 --> 23:52.097
We're gonna need some leverage.

23:52.180 --> 23:53.765
Yeah, we are.

24:06.862 --> 24:09.072
Nothing like a pedicure,
huh, Neema?

24:10.615 --> 24:13.410
Me, I can't ever get 'em.

24:13.493 --> 24:15.745
My feet are too ticklish, drives me crazy.

24:16.580 --> 24:17.706
Do I know you?

24:17.789 --> 24:18.665
Oh.

24:18.748 --> 24:20.667
I work for the defense attorney.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.336
Representing Trevor Elliott.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.297
The guy who killed Jan?

24:26.173 --> 24:27.591
Innocent till proven guilty.

24:28.258 --> 24:30.594
It's a fundamental tenet
of our justice system.

24:31.219 --> 24:32.387
What do you want?

24:32.471 --> 24:36.933
Were you aware your ex-husband
threatened Jan before he was murdered?

24:37.017 --> 24:39.853
If you were, why didn't you
report it to the authorities?

24:39.936 --> 24:41.271
What the hell?

24:41.354 --> 24:44.608
Just some of the questions
you'll be asked when you're subpoenaed,

24:44.691 --> 24:47.736
not to mention the ones
about your affair with the deceased.

24:50.864 --> 24:53.533
You might wanna start
thinkin' about your answers now.

24:56.036 --> 24:57.454
I think we're done.

24:58.580 --> 24:59.498
Great job.

25:05.295 --> 25:07.130
-<i>Hey.</i>
-Hey, where are you?

25:07.214 --> 25:08.673
<i>Just pokin' a bear.</i>

25:08.757 --> 25:10.634
<i>Like you said, it's the women.</i>

25:11.218 --> 25:12.511
<i>They get everything done.</i>

25:15.180 --> 25:19.017
This case may involve testimony
from experts in the field of firearms.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.436
Anyone have a problem
accepting their opinion?

25:23.730 --> 25:25.524
My client is a wealthy man.

25:26.149 --> 25:29.069
Does anybody think
that makes him more likely to be guilty?

25:30.737 --> 25:32.239
Any video game players here?

25:34.032 --> 25:36.660
-What's your favorite game?
-Who has family in the military?

25:37.661 --> 25:40.121
Who has had
a negative experience with the police?

25:41.289 --> 25:44.543
You know what drives me crazy?
Putting together IKEA furniture.

25:44.626 --> 25:45.585
Anyone else?

25:45.669 --> 25:46.545
Yeah.

25:51.424 --> 25:54.427
People thank and excuse
jurors 16, nine and 18.

26:07.732 --> 26:11.069
I'd like to thank and excuse
juror number eight, 13…

26:13.196 --> 26:14.030
and 28.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.244
Three and 35.

26:26.126 --> 26:28.545
Six, 37, 11, and 40.

26:37.345 --> 26:39.222
Number five's a lawyer.

26:39.306 --> 26:40.682
Lawyers make bad jurors.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.892
Not necessarily. She could be our foreman.

26:44.060 --> 26:47.814
Juror number five,
what kind of law do you practice?

26:48.398 --> 26:50.609
Real estate. Mostly transactional.

26:51.192 --> 26:54.237
You know once you're a juror,
you can't wear your lawyer hat.

26:54.321 --> 26:56.990
-Would you be able to separate the two?
-Of course.

26:58.158 --> 27:00.744
<i>She likes you,</i>
<i>but number ten likes you even more.</i>

27:04.497 --> 27:06.374
Have you ever practiced criminal law?

27:06.958 --> 27:09.586
No, but I have an interest in it.

27:09.669 --> 27:10.962
What kind of interest?

27:11.046 --> 27:13.923
I read novels.
I listen to true crime podcasts.

27:15.008 --> 27:17.344
I've been working on a screenplay.

27:18.053 --> 27:19.512
Me and everyone else in LA.

27:31.316 --> 27:32.942
Any more questions, Mr. Haller?

27:33.026 --> 27:35.862
I beg the court's indulgence
for just one moment.

27:42.619 --> 27:46.247
Your Honor, my sincere apologies,
but I have an urgent personal matter.

27:46.331 --> 27:48.166
Okay if we take a ten-minute recess?

27:48.249 --> 27:49.334
No more than that.

27:49.417 --> 27:50.418
Thank you.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.630
Jurors, you may take
this opportunity to stretch your legs.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.843
What the hell was that about?

27:58.927 --> 28:00.220
If it works, you'll see.

28:08.812 --> 28:10.730
Back on record
on <i>People vs. Elliott.</i>

28:10.814 --> 28:14.234
All parties present.
Peremptories are with the People.

28:16.736 --> 28:19.739
People would like to thank
and excuse juror five, Your Honor.

28:31.292 --> 28:33.086
I thought you liked the lawyer.

28:33.169 --> 28:36.464
I did. Until I found out
she was a frustrated writer

28:36.548 --> 28:39.342
who wants to turn this into a movie.
The last person I want.

28:39.426 --> 28:41.386
And you didn't
wanna waste your last challenge.

28:41.469 --> 28:42.721
Now you're getting it.

28:42.804 --> 28:44.347
I left my folder open.

28:44.431 --> 28:47.475
Thought maybe Golantz
couldn't resist a little peek.

28:47.559 --> 28:49.310
He thought blue meant I wanted her.

28:49.394 --> 28:50.854
But blue means cold.

28:51.438 --> 28:53.148
You learn that from your dad, too?

28:54.107 --> 28:55.775
I told you, you're in good hands.

28:56.568 --> 28:57.986
I'll see you tomorrow.

28:58.069 --> 29:00.739
No, Ray,
you know exactly what you're doing.

29:00.822 --> 29:02.615
And you know where it's gonna lead.

29:03.408 --> 29:05.326
Look, I gotta go. I'll call you later.

29:05.952 --> 29:07.287
Everything all right?

29:07.370 --> 29:10.248
Yeah, fine. How was day one?

29:10.331 --> 29:12.000
I threw some punches.

29:12.083 --> 29:13.084
Took some, too.

29:14.794 --> 29:15.837
Sure you're okay?

29:19.424 --> 29:20.675
It's my ex.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.970
Exes are complicated.

29:24.554 --> 29:26.389
Take it from me, I have two of them.

29:27.056 --> 29:30.310
She posted photos partying
with some people we used to tour with

29:30.393 --> 29:32.312
which means she's using again.

29:32.395 --> 29:34.856
There's an old saying
about horses and water.

29:37.066 --> 29:38.026
Thing is,

29:39.360 --> 29:40.987
I'm the one that got her hooked.

29:43.490 --> 29:44.616
I gotta make it right.

29:50.997 --> 29:52.332
You know these guys?

29:52.415 --> 29:53.666
Yeah, give me a second.

29:58.588 --> 29:59.464
Counselor.

30:00.048 --> 30:01.508
Could've just called, Ted.

30:01.591 --> 30:03.468
Yeah, well, we happened to be out.

30:04.677 --> 30:07.013
Saw you on TV. Guess you're back.

30:07.722 --> 30:08.973
I guess so.

30:09.057 --> 30:11.559
Good. I got some business for you.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.394
One of our boys needs help.

30:13.478 --> 30:17.065
Hard Case Casey,
some bullshit parole violation.

30:18.358 --> 30:21.069
Well, I'm nothing
if not a man of my word, Ted.

30:21.152 --> 30:23.279
Call my office,
we'll figure something out.

30:23.863 --> 30:24.739
-Will do.
-All right.

30:24.823 --> 30:25.657
Oh.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.076
Say hi to Cisco for me.

30:33.873 --> 30:35.500
You owe those guys or something?

30:35.583 --> 30:37.210
Or something. Come on, let's go.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.684
We're down to the wire.

30:52.767 --> 30:55.728
We've each got one challenge left.
Who do you think they're gonna cut?

30:56.604 --> 30:58.231
Number ten. That's his best bet.

30:59.649 --> 31:01.693
I might have a way to deal with that.

31:02.610 --> 31:03.653
Who should I cut?

31:04.237 --> 31:05.655
What does your gut tell you?

31:05.738 --> 31:07.532
<i>Seven or 27.</i>

31:08.157 --> 31:10.535
Twenty-seven? That's the Marlboro man.

31:11.244 --> 31:13.830
Everything about him
screams prosecution, but…

31:13.913 --> 31:15.331
He's an independent thinker.

31:15.415 --> 31:18.167
He might not accept
the State's line on the gunshot residue.

31:19.252 --> 31:21.004
On the other hand, number seven,

31:21.629 --> 31:22.797
<i>he is laser-focused.</i>

31:22.881 --> 31:24.549
Barely moves a muscle.

31:24.632 --> 31:25.925
Can't get a read on him.

31:26.009 --> 31:29.470
He's an engineer.
That means he's detail-oriented.

31:29.554 --> 31:32.307
A guy like that
can see through the State's case.

31:32.390 --> 31:33.349
It's a tough call.

31:33.975 --> 31:36.060
If it were a science, I'd win every hand.

31:36.144 --> 31:39.397
To make matters worse,
I have to run every choice by my client.

31:39.480 --> 31:40.815
You do have problems.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.443
You know, Trevor has a tell, too.

31:43.526 --> 31:45.486
Lining things up when he's nervous?

31:45.570 --> 31:46.613
Yeah, I noticed.

31:46.696 --> 31:48.573
Not just that, he rubs his legs.

31:49.365 --> 31:52.368
<i>He does it to pacify himself.</i>
<i>It can be a sign of deception.</i>

31:53.494 --> 31:57.081
You owe me dinner for all this.
I'll take anything with a Michelin star.

31:58.708 --> 32:01.044
-It's a date.
<i>-Well, I wouldn't go that far.</i>

32:01.127 --> 32:02.295
Maybe someday.

32:03.379 --> 32:04.714
If you ever get over her.

32:58.267 --> 33:00.269
Cute. Is this electric?

33:12.615 --> 33:13.992
A couple of things.

33:14.075 --> 33:17.495
Number 27 drives a hybrid
with a Sierra Club bumper sticker.

33:17.578 --> 33:20.289
Good. So, he goes his own way.
What else?

33:20.373 --> 33:22.750
Number seven
looks like he lives out of his car.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.461
What kind of engineer
makes a mess like that?

33:25.545 --> 33:27.714
That's a good question. All right. Thanks.

33:31.384 --> 33:32.385
What was that about?

33:33.386 --> 33:34.345
Our last challenge.

33:40.685 --> 33:41.811
Lorna?

33:43.688 --> 33:46.315
It's Ryan. From first year torts.

33:46.399 --> 33:47.608
Southwestern Law?

33:47.692 --> 33:49.694
-Right. Ryan.
-Yeah.

33:49.777 --> 33:51.279
I'm interning for a firm.

33:51.362 --> 33:53.489
-You?
-You know, same.

33:53.573 --> 33:54.490
I gotta ask.

33:54.574 --> 33:56.993
Where did you go?
You were a rock star in that class.

33:57.076 --> 34:01.706
Wheaton used to call on you all the time
and then one day you were just gone.

34:03.124 --> 34:04.292
I don't know, um…

34:05.835 --> 34:08.963
Work. Stuff. I don't know. Um…

34:10.006 --> 34:12.216
It was really good
to see you. I have to go.

34:19.057 --> 34:22.685
I think we've got to cut number seven.
There's something off about him.

34:22.769 --> 34:24.937
Don't look at the jury. Look at the grid.

34:27.106 --> 34:30.359
-Seven's an engineer. I like him.
-I did, too. But…

34:30.443 --> 34:32.695
No. He was giving me
good eye contact all day.

34:32.779 --> 34:36.657
Don't cut him. Cut number ten.
I don't like the way she looks at me.

34:36.741 --> 34:39.744
Ten? That's your best juror, Trevor.

34:39.827 --> 34:41.788
Got to try
and stop Golantz from cutting her.

34:41.871 --> 34:44.123
Mickey. What did I tell you?

34:45.166 --> 34:46.250
All rise.

34:49.712 --> 34:50.755
You may be seated.

34:52.632 --> 34:55.259
Ladies and gentlemen,
I apologize for the late start.

34:55.343 --> 34:58.221
But if we move quickly,
we can still finish before lunch.

34:58.304 --> 34:59.514
Counsel, you ready?

34:59.597 --> 35:02.767
The defense has a motion
that's best brought up in chambers.

35:02.850 --> 35:03.726
May we confer?

35:09.107 --> 35:12.276
Your Honor, the defense
would like to make a Wheeler motion.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.737
-I'm sorry, what?
-On what grounds?

35:14.821 --> 35:17.406
Mr. Golantz
has used nine of his challenges,

35:17.490 --> 35:19.450
seven of which have been on women.

35:19.534 --> 35:21.536
In my view that's called discrimination.

35:21.619 --> 35:24.789
It's called offensive. I have
a valid reason for every juror I've cut.

35:24.872 --> 35:26.749
I'm sure we would love to hear them.

35:26.833 --> 35:30.253
It doesn't make sense. Your client is
accused of murdering his wife.

35:30.336 --> 35:32.839
-I want all the women I can get.
-Then why did you cut so many?

35:32.922 --> 35:34.715
Mr. Golantz, save it.

35:35.424 --> 35:37.301
You're reaching here. Motion denied.

35:38.803 --> 35:41.973
So much for finishing this morning.
We'll take an early lunch.

35:42.056 --> 35:45.393
You each have one challenge left.
Let's not make this a nail-biter.

35:47.520 --> 35:51.107
-That's bullshit and you know it.
-Then you have nothing to worry about.

35:57.738 --> 35:59.031
Dennis Wojciechowski.

36:00.616 --> 36:02.034
Yeah, I can find you, too.

36:02.743 --> 36:03.911
You threatened my wife?

36:06.831 --> 36:08.040
Ex-wife.

36:08.124 --> 36:11.669
And I didn't threaten her.
Just presented her with a couple of facts.

36:12.753 --> 36:14.088
Here's a fact for you.

36:14.172 --> 36:17.383
You come near me or my family again,
I break you like a toy.

36:18.259 --> 36:19.218
Is that a gun?

36:19.302 --> 36:20.595
You don't wanna find out.

36:21.345 --> 36:23.222
Stay the fuck away from my wife.

36:40.489 --> 36:41.616
Tanya Cruz.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.493
Detective Lankford, LAPD.

36:44.577 --> 36:47.079
This is Maggie McPherson
from the DA's office.

36:48.539 --> 36:49.665
What is this about?

36:49.749 --> 36:50.958
It's about Angelo Soto.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.921
Don't worry. We have eyes on him.
He's waiting for you at home.

36:55.004 --> 36:57.506
-What do you want?
-Just a minute of your time.

36:58.758 --> 37:01.552
Only one reason
a man goes to the gynecologist with you.

37:01.636 --> 37:03.554
How many months pregnant are you?

37:05.139 --> 37:08.267
Three months.
I have to go now. He's waiting.

37:09.352 --> 37:12.063
Are you aware your name
is on several of his bank accounts?

37:13.022 --> 37:13.856
I…

37:14.815 --> 37:17.109
He had me sign some papers.

37:17.193 --> 37:18.861
That's how guys like him operate.

37:18.945 --> 37:21.864
They insulate themselves
so someone else takes the fall.

37:21.948 --> 37:23.115
I don't understand.

37:23.199 --> 37:24.992
Okay. Well, let me be clear.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.160
Soto's gonna go down,

37:26.244 --> 37:29.121
if you're part of the paper trail,
you're going down with him.

37:29.205 --> 37:32.208
Give birth to your baby in jail.
They'll take it away from you.

37:32.291 --> 37:34.877
Please. I don't know
anything about his business.

37:34.961 --> 37:36.629
For your sake, I hope you're wrong.

37:37.922 --> 37:39.590
You're gonna need a lawyer.

37:39.674 --> 37:40.800
You can't trust his.

37:40.883 --> 37:43.970
Say anything to anyone, you're dead.
You know that, right?

37:45.179 --> 37:47.473
You're gonna need someone you can trust.

37:47.556 --> 37:48.474
Trust him.

38:06.367 --> 38:07.368
Mr. Golantz.

38:15.376 --> 38:18.296
People would like to thank and excuse
juror 27, Your Honor.

38:23.634 --> 38:25.511
You said he was gonna cut number ten.

38:25.594 --> 38:28.014
I said I'd keep that
from happening and I did.

38:29.098 --> 38:30.975
Counsel, approach, please.

38:46.782 --> 38:47.616
What?

38:49.201 --> 38:50.911
Juror ten just spoke to the clerk.

38:50.995 --> 38:54.123
She thought you were
following her in the parking lot at lunch.

38:54.206 --> 38:55.041
What?

38:56.292 --> 38:59.211
-That's ridiculous.
-Were you trying to intimidate a juror?

38:59.295 --> 39:00.296
No.

39:02.590 --> 39:04.175
I was trying to find my car.

39:05.134 --> 39:06.677
The one you made me drive.

39:07.303 --> 39:08.137
The Prius.

39:08.220 --> 39:11.140
Do you have any idea
how many Priuses are in Los Angeles?

39:12.892 --> 39:14.268
Is the judge gonna cut her?

39:14.352 --> 39:16.979
There's not
enough evidence you did anything wrong.

39:17.063 --> 39:18.230
There, see?

39:18.314 --> 39:20.983
That doesn't change the fact
she still thinks you did.

39:21.067 --> 39:22.610
So now I have to kick her,

39:23.235 --> 39:24.528
with my last challenge.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.075
Mr. Haller?

39:29.658 --> 39:32.995
The defense would like
to thank and excuse juror number ten.

39:36.457 --> 39:38.376
I didn't do it on purpose.

39:38.459 --> 39:39.794
I hope not, Trevor.

39:39.877 --> 39:41.670
With you, I never really know.

39:46.801 --> 39:48.594
And with that, we have our jury.

39:48.677 --> 39:50.304
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.847
We'll see you Monday morning.

39:57.436 --> 39:59.605
Truth is,
you can never really know for sure

39:59.688 --> 40:01.524
if you picked the right jury or not.

40:01.607 --> 40:03.484
That's why
they call them the Gods of Guilt.

40:04.693 --> 40:06.695
<i>All you can do is pray to them.</i>

40:18.666 --> 40:20.000
<i>I'll break you like a toy.</i>

40:20.835 --> 40:21.877
<i>Is that a gun?</i>

40:21.961 --> 40:23.379
<i>You don't wanna find out.</i>

40:24.505 --> 40:26.298
<i>Stay the fuck away from my wife.</i>

40:35.224 --> 40:36.058
-Hey.
-Hey.

40:37.476 --> 40:40.521
I was on my way home.
I figured I'd check on Hayley.

40:40.604 --> 40:43.232
She's online with some friends.
I'd leave her be.

40:44.984 --> 40:46.610
I figured I'd check on you too.

40:48.487 --> 40:51.323
-You don't have to do this, Haller.
-Do what?

40:54.660 --> 40:57.121
I'm sorry I haven't called you back.

40:57.204 --> 40:58.330
Rough couple of days.

40:59.540 --> 41:04.462
And the other night
I was upset, obviously,

41:04.545 --> 41:08.174
and things went
somewhere they shouldn't have, and…

41:08.257 --> 41:09.341
I'm sorry.

41:09.425 --> 41:11.385
Whoever that was, that was not me.

41:14.763 --> 41:16.765
No, that was you.

41:16.849 --> 41:18.767
I mean, it smelled like you.

41:18.851 --> 41:19.727
It felt like you.

41:19.810 --> 41:20.686
Mickey.

41:22.229 --> 41:24.148
Can we agree
it's good you left when you did?

41:25.608 --> 41:29.153
Yeah. Good. We're both glad I left, so.

41:32.865 --> 41:35.451
What are you doing here?
Don't you have jury selection?

41:35.534 --> 41:36.827
No, we finished today.

41:36.911 --> 41:39.872
Besides I can walk
and chew gum at the same time.

41:39.955 --> 41:41.582
Gum? Is that what I am?

41:42.958 --> 41:43.959
Very tasty gum?

41:44.043 --> 41:45.127
Okay.

41:46.337 --> 41:47.338
You know what?

41:47.421 --> 41:50.508
I actually have a favor
I need for my case.

41:50.591 --> 41:51.634
Anything.

41:51.717 --> 41:54.053
I don't have time
to talk about it tonight,

41:54.136 --> 41:55.471
but I'll call you tomorrow?

41:56.764 --> 41:58.807
The things I do for you, McFierce.

42:24.583 --> 42:26.502
-Counselor.
-Jesus.

42:26.585 --> 42:30.297
You scared the hell out of me.
Couldn't this wait until morning?

42:30.381 --> 42:34.343
Sorry, but that missing money
of Jerry's you mentioned?

42:34.426 --> 42:36.178
I checked it with his bank.

42:36.262 --> 42:40.432
He took out 150 grand, in cash.

42:40.516 --> 42:42.017
Told the banker it was to buy a boat.

42:42.101 --> 42:44.728
I've checked every marina
from here to San Diego.

42:44.812 --> 42:45.896
There is no boat.

42:46.605 --> 42:48.357
Not one registered to Jerry anyway.

42:50.109 --> 42:52.194
So, what are you thinking?

42:52.278 --> 42:53.779
After Bruce Carlin's death,

42:53.862 --> 42:57.283
Riverside PD searched his place
and found a burner phone he used.

42:57.366 --> 42:59.118
-Great.
-Don't get too excited.

42:59.201 --> 43:01.870
Carlin was careful.
There's nothing explicit.

43:02.788 --> 43:06.166
But the messages show
he made a delivery to somebody

43:06.250 --> 43:09.169
the same day Jerry took out all that cash.

43:09.253 --> 43:10.379
What kind of delivery?

43:10.462 --> 43:13.632
No idea. But we've got missing money.

43:13.716 --> 43:15.843
We've got mystery calls from the Feds.

43:15.926 --> 43:19.221
And the Elliott case
is the biggest one you inherited, right?

43:19.305 --> 43:21.473
The biggest case of Jerry's career?

43:22.099 --> 43:24.852
Lot of pressure
to beat a high-profile murder like that.

43:24.935 --> 43:26.312
Yeah, tell me about it.

43:26.937 --> 43:27.938
All right, so?

43:29.273 --> 43:31.900
What if the money was for a bribe?
