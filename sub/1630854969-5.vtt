Previously on
"Gotham Knights"...

00:03.438 --> 00:04.874
Duela: We've been set up.

00:04.917 --> 00:06.180
Turner: We're gonna find
who really killed my dad

00:06.223 --> 00:07.964
and clear our names.

00:08.007 --> 00:10.010
Cullen: How did
the Talon get ahold
of the knives

00:10.053 --> 00:11.446
belonging
to a serial killer

00:11.489 --> 00:12.969
who's been dead for
almost 100 years?

00:13.013 --> 00:14.840
This says Felix Harmon
had a daughter.

00:14.884 --> 00:18.105
Beware The Court of Owls.

00:18.148 --> 00:21.325
Speak not a whispered word
of them

00:21.369 --> 00:24.024
or they'll send the Talon
for your head...

00:24.067 --> 00:25.895
Mayor Hill: No!

00:25.938 --> 00:28.028
Commissioner Soto:
Well, according to
the mayor's security detail,

00:28.071 --> 00:29.203
there is a key
unaccounted for.

00:29.246 --> 00:31.031
That could lead us
to the killer.

00:31.074 --> 00:33.076
Stephanie: Turner, you need
to get out of there right now.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.469
Cressida is one of them. She's
working with The Court of Owls.

00:34.512 --> 00:36.166
Turner: All that time,

00:36.210 --> 00:38.342
Cressida was plotting
to murder my dad.

00:38.386 --> 00:41.737
She was the last piece
of family I had left.

00:43.478 --> 00:45.697
[Blues music playing]

00:48.222 --> 00:50.398
[Laughter, indistinct chatter]

01:00.930 --> 01:02.453
Bartender: Gentlemen.

01:02.497 --> 01:03.933
What can I get ya?

01:03.976 --> 01:07.806
Whiskey neat, right?
Or was it scotch?

01:07.850 --> 01:09.330
Just the cash.

01:09.373 --> 01:10.766
Yeah. Yeah.

01:11.723 --> 01:13.377
[Typing on cash register

[Register bell rings]

01:31.134 --> 01:32.527
You're short.

01:32.570 --> 01:34.833
Business has
been slow.

01:34.877 --> 01:38.185
You know how it is.

01:38.228 --> 01:40.274
We'll get you the rest.
I-I promise.

01:40.317 --> 01:42.232
We just need a little bit
more time. Please.

01:42.276 --> 01:45.496
I would. I would,

01:45.539 --> 01:48.412
only the boss
don't accept IOUs.

01:48.456 --> 01:50.240
[Lighter clicks]

01:50.283 --> 01:52.329
Bartender:
No. Oh, no, no, no.
Please, please don't.

01:52.372 --> 01:53.852
This place is
all we've got!

01:53.896 --> 01:55.463
Not anymore.

01:59.989 --> 02:05.777
No! No! No!
[Man chuckles]

[Door opens]

02:36.895 --> 02:39.028
Oh, good.
You're awake.

02:39.071 --> 02:41.639
Barely. Good morning.

02:42.945 --> 02:44.425
You're 15.

02:44.468 --> 02:46.340
Since when do you need
to drink coffee?

02:46.383 --> 02:48.994
Since sleeping in
on a Saturday
became a crime

02:49.038 --> 02:51.345
and the punishment is
SAT prep class.

02:51.388 --> 02:54.478
Oh, you groan now,
but you'll thank me later.

02:54.522 --> 02:56.088
You know
what I always say.

02:56.132 --> 02:57.481
If you stay ready...

02:57.525 --> 02:59.091
Both: You don't have
to get ready.

02:59.135 --> 03:00.702
Yeah. I know.

03:00.745 --> 03:02.704
Why are your shoes
so dirty?

03:02.747 --> 03:08.623
Um...I volunteered to help
the agriculture club.

03:08.666 --> 03:10.277
Well, just make sure
you don't track

03:10.320 --> 03:12.670
your volunteering
all over the house.

03:13.802 --> 03:15.717
You want to do
takeout tonight?

03:15.760 --> 03:17.545
That way, you'll have
leftovers tomorrow
when I'm on shift.

03:17.588 --> 03:19.024
I thought you were coming
to my school tomorrow.

03:19.068 --> 03:20.983
We have that
Parents' Sunday Luncheon.

03:21.026 --> 03:23.725
Oh, shoot.
That's right.

03:23.768 --> 03:25.814
No, I'll--I'll see if I
can get a shift change.

03:25.857 --> 03:28.382
No. it's OK.
It'll be the same

03:28.425 --> 03:29.905
dog and pony show
as last year.

03:29.948 --> 03:32.821
No. It's important that
I show up to these things.

03:32.864 --> 03:36.390
I miss one event,
and that becomes my label--

03:36.433 --> 03:38.914
the mother who never
shows up for her daughter.

03:38.957 --> 03:41.351
Your label will always
be "badass mom who saves
lives on the regular"

03:41.395 --> 03:43.310
in my book.

03:43.353 --> 03:45.050
Yeah, I'm working on
a shorter label.

03:45.094 --> 03:46.226
[Chuckles]

03:46.269 --> 03:49.664
Go on!
Go save lives.

03:49.707 --> 03:52.971
Dr. Kelley: Love you.
Carrie: Love you, too.

03:53.015 --> 03:54.408
[Door closes]

04:02.938 --> 04:04.592
I've got something.

04:06.463 --> 04:08.335
OK. Let me try this again.

04:08.378 --> 04:10.075
I brought doughnuts.

04:10.119 --> 04:12.469
Duela: Someone turn her down.

04:13.775 --> 04:15.516
Turner: Tell me
you found an explanation

04:15.559 --> 04:17.125
for how a century-old,

04:17.168 --> 04:18.997
supposedly dead,
serial killer

04:19.041 --> 04:21.913
left fresh fingerprints on
Eunice Monroe's music box.

04:21.957 --> 04:23.872
He's a vampire?

04:23.915 --> 04:25.743
Vampires aren't real.

04:25.787 --> 04:27.441
Well, neither was
Killer Croc

04:27.484 --> 04:28.964
until he crawled out
of a storm drain, so,

04:29.007 --> 04:31.488
break out the garlic
and the holy water.

04:31.532 --> 04:33.664
That fingerprint
has to be a fluke.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.884
It's literally
impossible for
Felix Harmon

04:35.927 --> 04:37.320
to be the Talon.

04:37.364 --> 04:38.669
OK, but even if he is,

04:38.713 --> 04:40.671
we dropped the whole
Batcave on his ass.

04:40.715 --> 04:41.977
Is it too much
to hope that we

04:42.020 --> 04:43.631
don't need to worry
about him anymore?

04:43.674 --> 04:45.154
I don't know.
If he really is

04:45.197 --> 04:46.808
130 years old
and still in fighting shape,

04:46.851 --> 04:48.375
who knows what
he can survive.

04:48.418 --> 04:50.332
Yeah. Bad boys
from beyond the grave?

04:50.377 --> 04:51.813
Not my wheelhouse.

04:51.856 --> 04:53.902
But I did dig up
a lead we can follow--

04:53.945 --> 04:56.165
Cressida's finances.

04:56.207 --> 04:58.733
So, not a grave but
probably just as dirty.

04:58.776 --> 05:01.083
Yup. Since Cressida's name

05:01.126 --> 05:03.085
kept showing up on that
nursing home sign-in sheet,

05:03.128 --> 05:04.739
paying a visit to
the Talon's daughter,

05:04.782 --> 05:06.393
I thought, What if
she's also paying

05:06.436 --> 05:07.742
for dear old Eunice's
stay there?

05:07.785 --> 05:09.483
Yeah, that makes sense.

05:09.526 --> 05:11.659
But she's not. Well,
at least not directly.

05:11.702 --> 05:14.575
She wouldn't want
a financial tie
because she's smart.

05:14.618 --> 05:17.317
Yeah. Smart enough
to worm her way
into my dad's life.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.449
Pretending to
care about us.

05:22.147 --> 05:24.193
So, uh, who is paying

05:24.236 --> 05:26.413
for the old gal's stay
at the nursing home?

05:26.456 --> 05:29.154
Something called
"G&S Limited Holdings
and Acquisitions."

05:29.198 --> 05:30.417
What's that?

05:30.460 --> 05:33.594
I think it's a shell
company, a fake.

05:33.637 --> 05:35.378
Probably controlled
by The Court

05:35.422 --> 05:37.902
to pay for things
they don't want
traceable back to them.

05:37.946 --> 05:40.557
But I may
have hacked my way

05:40.601 --> 05:42.516
into getting
their tax returns.

05:42.558 --> 05:44.692
Harper: Oh.

05:44.735 --> 05:46.041
Which one of
your boy-toys

05:46.084 --> 05:47.651
is gonna take
the fall for that?

05:47.695 --> 05:49.784
I hope he's as cute
as the last one.

05:49.827 --> 05:55.442
Whatever this company is,
it's taking in a lot of money.

05:55.485 --> 05:57.444
Does this company
have an address?

06:05.277 --> 06:07.715
Harvey?

06:07.758 --> 06:09.934
I'm sorry to show up
unannounced like this.

06:09.978 --> 06:12.546
What can I do for you,
Mrs. March?

06:12.589 --> 06:17.377
So formal. Then I'll
cut to the chase.

06:19.117 --> 06:20.902
[Door closes]

06:20.945 --> 06:23.470
I know my husband
came to see you
a few days ago.

06:23.513 --> 06:24.949
Was it about us?

06:24.993 --> 06:27.038
That was years ago,
Rebecca.

06:27.082 --> 06:29.606
There is no "us"
for Lincoln to ask about.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.434
Rebecca: You know that's not--
Harvey: We discussed the need

06:31.478 --> 06:34.394
to step up security
after what happened
to Mayor Hill.

06:34.437 --> 06:36.221
That's all.

06:36.265 --> 06:38.093
But I think it's best...

06:39.834 --> 06:42.183
for you and I
to keep our distance.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.927
Neither campaign
needs the mess.

06:45.970 --> 06:47.537
"Mess."

06:48.799 --> 06:51.062
You sure know how
to give a girl perspective.

06:51.106 --> 06:54.631
Can we just be pleasant
for the press
and otherwise stay away?

06:56.459 --> 06:58.156
Give Lincoln my best.

06:59.462 --> 07:00.724
You tell him.

07:01.812 --> 07:04.119
Apparently,
I was never here.

07:16.348 --> 07:19.221
Cullen: This is G&S
Holdings and Acquisitions?

07:19.264 --> 07:20.831
Apparently so.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.920
Oh, boy.

07:24.226 --> 07:26.620
What? You know
this place?

07:26.663 --> 07:28.622
Unfortunately.

07:40.155 --> 07:41.939
Harper: Yup.

07:45.029 --> 07:46.944
Those guys are
McKillens--

07:46.988 --> 07:49.469
city's most
dangerous mob.

07:49.512 --> 07:51.862
Drug trafficking,
smuggling,

07:51.906 --> 07:54.125
running
protection rackets.

07:54.169 --> 07:55.649
Not good people.

07:55.692 --> 07:57.564
How do you know
it's them?

07:57.607 --> 08:02.046
I, uh, kinda
dated one.

08:02.090 --> 08:04.484
You what?

08:04.527 --> 08:07.225
Well, this just got juicy.

08:08.879 --> 08:11.186
Stephanie: So,
what did you guys find?

08:11.229 --> 08:13.014
Cullen: Why don't
you ask Harper?

08:13.057 --> 08:14.929
Because she seems to know
a lot about what we saw.

08:14.972 --> 08:16.452
It's a McKillen
shipping yard.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.671
I know because
I dated one.

08:17.714 --> 08:18.889
There. Now you're
caught up.

08:18.933 --> 08:20.674
I remember Dylan
mentioning

08:20.717 --> 08:22.676
they laundered
money for some
pretty bad people.

08:22.719 --> 08:24.242
Oh, and that wasn't
a red flag for you?

08:24.286 --> 08:26.070
Stephanie:
Wait, wait. I'm sorry.

08:26.114 --> 08:28.029
His name
is Dylan McKillen?

08:28.072 --> 08:29.900
The point is,
only the boss

08:29.944 --> 08:32.207
actually knew who they
were laundering money for.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.251
Whoever it was,
they were that dangerous.

08:34.296 --> 08:35.688
The Court of Owls?

08:35.732 --> 08:37.342
Harper: That could explain
how the McKillens

08:37.385 --> 08:39.344
have stayed untouchable
for so many years.

08:39.388 --> 08:40.955
Probably getting protection
from The Court

08:40.998 --> 08:42.870
in exchange for
laundering their cash.

08:42.913 --> 08:44.219
With that much money
being funneled through

08:44.261 --> 08:45.915
so many shell companies,
the McKillens

08:45.960 --> 08:47.701
have to have some system
to keep track of it all.

08:47.744 --> 08:49.703
Records like that
could directly prove

08:49.746 --> 08:51.618
The Court is real
and involved

08:51.661 --> 08:53.707
with the biggest
crime ring in Gotham.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.057
We'd take down The Court
and the McKillens.

08:57.406 --> 08:59.016
I can hack them.

08:59.060 --> 09:00.627
See if I could
get ahold
of those records.

09:00.670 --> 09:02.193
Do you really think
an organized crime ring

09:02.237 --> 09:04.369
would be dumb enough
to keep digital records?

09:04.413 --> 09:06.023
For security, it's
probably all hard copy.

09:06.067 --> 09:07.677
Duela: Well, OK,
so, what? What?

09:07.721 --> 09:09.374
We just walk up to
the McKillens and we say,

09:09.418 --> 09:11.072
"One criminal ledger, please"?

09:11.115 --> 09:15.076
No. We're gonna
rob the mob.

09:21.909 --> 09:24.041
Carrie: "Rob the mob"?

09:24.085 --> 09:26.348
Since when are we
letting Duela come up
with all the plans?

09:26.391 --> 09:28.742
Actually, this
one's all Turner.

09:28.785 --> 09:30.178
[Laughs]
Congrats, Turner.

09:30.221 --> 09:32.354
You're officially crazier
than the Crazy One.

09:32.397 --> 09:35.487
Turner: It's not crazy.
Carrie: Fine. Reckless.

09:35.531 --> 09:37.446
Think about it.
The upside of this
could be huge.

09:37.489 --> 09:39.622
Take down the McKillens
and take down The Court.

09:39.665 --> 09:42.277
I mean, the McKillens
leach off the poorest
people in the city.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.800
They target The Narrows
the most, right?

09:43.844 --> 09:45.280
Yeah. Thanks
for the guilt.

09:45.323 --> 09:46.977
OK, what Turner's
trying to say

09:47.021 --> 09:48.588
is that if we
find the ledger,

09:48.631 --> 09:50.067
we could follow
the flow of money

09:50.111 --> 09:51.765
to understand what
The Court is up to.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.636
Maybe even find proof
to clear our names.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.420
Stephanie:
We could go today,
if we didn't have

09:55.464 --> 09:57.814
that stupid Parents'
Luncheon thing.

09:57.858 --> 10:00.077
I have to give a speech.
It's a whole deal.

10:00.121 --> 10:02.079
Actually,
my mom has a shift,

10:02.123 --> 10:06.127
so, she wouldn't
really know if I ditch.

10:06.170 --> 10:07.824
So, you're in?

10:07.868 --> 10:11.611
Storming a mob stronghold
in broad daylight?

10:11.654 --> 10:14.396
What could go wrong?

10:14.439 --> 10:18.269
Harper says today's when
security at McKillen HQ
will be the lightest.

10:18.313 --> 10:21.316
Apparently, McKillens take
their Sunday churchgoing
pretty seriously.

10:21.359 --> 10:23.231
Stephanie: As any good
Irish Catholic mobster does.

10:23.274 --> 10:26.669
To pull this off,
we're gonna need
a few prayers of our own.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.628
Man: Thank you.
Woman: Anytime.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.412
[Phone ringing]

10:32.109 --> 10:33.284
Chase.

10:33.328 --> 10:34.808
Harvey. Hi.

10:34.851 --> 10:36.157
Can I talk to you
for a second?

10:36.200 --> 10:37.506
Ha ha ha!
You gonna ask

10:37.549 --> 10:39.203
for a campaign
donation?

10:39.247 --> 10:41.553
I'll settle for
your professional
opinion on something.

10:41.597 --> 10:43.164
Come on in.

10:47.472 --> 10:49.300
How can I help?

10:49.344 --> 10:52.129
I've got a possible
suspect in a case

10:52.173 --> 10:53.827
who woke up
in possession of

10:53.870 --> 10:56.220
a piece of evidence--

10:56.264 --> 10:58.483
one that could possibly
tie him to the crime,

10:58.527 --> 11:02.226
except he doesn't
remember how it got there.

11:02.270 --> 11:06.666
Says he's been
experiencing missing time

11:06.709 --> 11:10.452
and possibly doing things
that he doesn't remember.

11:10.495 --> 11:11.671
And you believe him?

11:11.714 --> 11:12.715
I do.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.064
I don't think that

11:14.108 --> 11:15.457
he would have
any reason to lie.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.677
People don't always need
a reason, Harvey.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.374
This guy's
telling the truth.

11:19.417 --> 11:21.855
Or at least he
thinks he is.

11:21.898 --> 11:23.552
What do you mean?

11:23.595 --> 11:26.381
I'm wondering
if he could
be suffering

11:26.424 --> 11:29.601
from something like
identity dysmorphia.

11:29.645 --> 11:32.474
Like the kind
your father suffered from?

11:34.432 --> 11:37.609
Harvey, we've known
each other for a long time.

11:37.653 --> 11:38.915
I can't help you
unless you're

11:38.959 --> 11:40.961
being completely honest
with me.

11:41.004 --> 11:42.789
What do you mean?

11:44.529 --> 11:47.402
Are we really talking
about a suspect?

11:50.448 --> 11:52.799
Am I really
that bad of a liar?

11:52.842 --> 11:54.496
[Chuckles softly]

11:54.539 --> 11:56.540
I mean, I actually think
that's a good quality

11:56.585 --> 11:58.282
for Gotham's next mayor.

12:00.154 --> 12:02.460
Now, tell me what's
really going on.

12:06.247 --> 12:09.729
Harper:
So, this freight yard
is McKillen HQ,

12:09.772 --> 12:12.644
and this charming
concrete depot

12:12.688 --> 12:15.082
is where they do
their...money stuff.

12:15.125 --> 12:16.866
They have
pretty heavy security

12:16.910 --> 12:18.215
surrounding it
at all times.

12:18.259 --> 12:19.869
So, how were you
in there before?

12:19.913 --> 12:21.305
Dylan and I
hung out there.

12:21.349 --> 12:22.916
That's code
for getting b--

12:22.959 --> 12:24.091
Thank you. We know.

12:24.134 --> 12:26.093
Still doesn't explain.

12:27.398 --> 12:29.139
Dylan had a key.

12:29.183 --> 12:31.141
He's kind of the boss' son.

12:31.185 --> 12:33.796
Oh. OK.
That's hot.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.624
Great. Because
it's not enough
you dated a mobster.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.800
It had to be
the riskiest one
possible.

12:37.844 --> 12:40.324
Doesn't change the fact
that we still need
to get into the place.

12:40.368 --> 12:43.763
So, if anyone else
has anything else
to add that is not

12:43.806 --> 12:45.721
about my relationship
with Dylan,

12:45.765 --> 12:47.070
please speak now.

12:47.114 --> 12:49.116
Well, if trucks are
constantly going

12:49.159 --> 12:51.248
in and out through
the yard every day...

12:51.292 --> 12:53.947
Then maybe we can
hitch a ride.

13:07.438 --> 13:09.484
[Indistinct chatter]

13:23.498 --> 13:25.587
Woman: So, then we finally
find the resort

13:25.630 --> 13:29.678
after hours spent hiking
in the wrong direction.

13:29.721 --> 13:32.507
Oh, if only Arthur
had just listened to me

13:32.550 --> 13:35.510
when I said that
we should go left.

13:35.553 --> 13:37.642
You know, but at least
we got our steps in, right?

13:37.686 --> 13:39.035
Probably for the year.

13:39.079 --> 13:40.732
[Laughter]

13:40.776 --> 13:43.431
Stephanie: Hey, Mom.
Mom: Mm.

13:43.474 --> 13:45.085
Stephanie.
Excuse me, guys.

13:45.128 --> 13:46.913
Got you
a club soda.

13:46.956 --> 13:48.349
Mm.

13:51.656 --> 13:54.572
You're an angel,
as everyone keeps saying.

13:54.616 --> 13:57.314
All this glowing talk about
you has got me parched.

13:57.358 --> 13:58.838
They're probably
just kissing up

13:58.881 --> 14:00.927
to their favorite
celebrity donor.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.711
No, no, no.
It's all true.

14:02.754 --> 14:04.539
I am proud of you.

14:06.323 --> 14:08.978
So, you ready for
your big speech?

14:09.022 --> 14:11.372
Uh, more or less.

14:11.415 --> 14:13.026
Oh, please.

14:13.069 --> 14:15.637
You are
your father's daughter.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.682
You're gonna be great.

14:17.726 --> 14:18.901
Break a leg, sweetie.

14:18.945 --> 14:20.163
Thanks, Mom.

14:31.305 --> 14:33.655
Man on radio: I'm
looking at it right now.
It went out this morning...

14:33.698 --> 14:35.265
Harper: If the ledger
is anywhere,

14:35.309 --> 14:37.485
it would be
in that warehouse.

14:37.528 --> 14:39.487
So, what do we do now?

14:40.662 --> 14:43.534
I think if we stay low
and head east--

14:43.578 --> 14:44.971
Turner!

14:46.537 --> 14:48.800
Man on radio:
Delivery should be arriving.

14:48.844 --> 14:50.063
Copy that.

14:52.065 --> 14:55.895
[Grunting]

15:00.464 --> 15:03.032
Harper: Are you
kidding me?

15:03.076 --> 15:04.773
He could've radioed
the other guards.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.906
And now he's sleeping
on the job.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.864
Can we just hurry
and get the door open?

15:08.908 --> 15:11.562
[Sighs]
Oh, my God.

15:12.781 --> 15:14.435
Come on, Freek.
[Beeping]

15:15.610 --> 15:17.525
Frequency finder.

15:17.568 --> 15:20.093
Trying to find
the right frequency
to open the bay door.

15:20.136 --> 15:22.312
[Beeping stops, chirps]

15:30.320 --> 15:31.931
Carrie:
Outside's clear.

15:31.974 --> 15:34.281
Gonna make sure
we're alone in here.

15:41.070 --> 15:43.116
Cullen: Bingo.

15:50.210 --> 15:53.430
[Humming, whirring]

16:05.442 --> 16:07.836
Well, looks like we got
what we came here for.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.272
Let's get out of here.

16:09.316 --> 16:10.882
All right.
Where's Duela?

16:10.926 --> 16:12.580
Duela: Over here...

16:15.104 --> 16:17.193
with all of this.

16:19.935 --> 16:22.416
[Duela laughing]

16:35.951 --> 16:37.997
Ha ha! I should've
worn something
with more pockets.

16:38.040 --> 16:41.130
Jeez. I'm rich.
I'm rich!

16:41.174 --> 16:43.524
Carrie: It's not yours.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.569
Ah. My God,
you're right,
Little Bird.

16:45.613 --> 16:49.356
I'm so sorry.
We are rich.

16:49.399 --> 16:51.706
No. No, Duela,
this is, like, dirty money.

16:51.749 --> 16:53.490
This has been taken
from innocent people,

16:53.534 --> 16:55.101
small businesses
in the neighborhood.

16:55.144 --> 16:57.059
Right. Exactly.
So, why should we let

16:57.103 --> 16:58.539
the McKillens keep it?

16:58.582 --> 17:00.541
OK. We don't have time
to debate this.

17:00.584 --> 17:03.935
Harper: 16 rows across,
all stacks of hundreds.

17:03.979 --> 17:05.502
Look at the volume here.

17:05.546 --> 17:07.461
There's gotta be at least
$30 million.

17:07.503 --> 17:09.550
Ohh!

17:09.593 --> 17:11.247
The McKillen
protection racket is good
but not this good.

17:11.290 --> 17:13.162
What does that mean?

17:13.205 --> 17:15.121
This has to be Court
money that the McKillens
are laundering for them.

17:15.164 --> 17:16.905
OK, so, it's
clean dirty money.

17:16.948 --> 17:18.340
Still not a reason
to take it.

17:18.385 --> 17:19.560
Not not a reason
to take it.

17:19.603 --> 17:20.865
Thank you.
See, guys,

17:20.909 --> 17:22.345
come on,
come on.

17:22.388 --> 17:23.999
We gotta hit 'em
where it hurts
the most,

17:24.042 --> 17:25.218
their pockets.

17:25.261 --> 17:26.871
[Chuckles weakly]

17:26.915 --> 17:28.308
We can't leave it
here, so, what do
we do with it?

17:28.351 --> 17:30.049
Man: Better
question is...

17:33.269 --> 17:35.010
what am I gonna do
about you?

17:35.054 --> 17:36.316
[Pistol cocks]

17:41.147 --> 17:42.887
Harper?

17:42.931 --> 17:44.759
Harper: Dylan!

17:44.802 --> 17:46.848
How was church?

17:49.503 --> 17:52.593
Good afternoon, everyone.
On behalf of the student body,

17:52.636 --> 17:54.290
I'd like to welcome you

17:54.334 --> 17:55.987
to the Gotham Academy
Annual Parents' Luncheon.

17:56.031 --> 17:58.164
For over a century,
the Academy has shaped

17:58.207 --> 18:00.122
the minds and careers
of Gotham's

18:00.166 --> 18:02.472
most prominent citizens,

18:02.516 --> 18:05.432
and our city's next generation
of leaders is--

18:08.478 --> 18:12.308
um...and our city's
next generation of leaders

18:12.352 --> 18:15.442
is right here
on this very campus.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.575
Why do I have the key,

18:18.619 --> 18:20.708
and why did I
wake up in City Hall

18:20.751 --> 18:22.579
with no memory
of how I got there?

18:22.623 --> 18:26.105
If I--if I--if I can't
remember anything,

18:26.148 --> 18:28.107
then I don't have
any alibi.

18:28.150 --> 18:30.326
So, what is the more
likely scenario?

18:30.370 --> 18:32.676
That you have
a homicidal alter ego

18:32.720 --> 18:36.506
who assassinated
the mayor in the most
byzantine manner possible,

18:36.550 --> 18:39.466
yet neglected to remove
the one piece of evidence

18:39.509 --> 18:41.381
tying you to the murder,

18:41.424 --> 18:43.426
or that the car keys
of a man

18:43.470 --> 18:45.733
that you work with closely
on a daily basis

18:45.776 --> 18:47.952
accidentally got mixed up
with your own?

18:47.996 --> 18:50.825
Sure, right.
If you put it that way.

18:50.868 --> 18:52.740
Harvey, I think what
you're really afraid of

18:52.783 --> 18:54.872
is becoming
like your father.

18:56.570 --> 18:58.833
The man brutalized you
for years.

18:58.876 --> 19:01.662
And then he would have
no memory of it.

19:01.705 --> 19:04.665
He made you doubt
your own sanity,
just like you're doing now.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.319
Yeah, but now I have
good reason to.

19:06.362 --> 19:07.755
This is not
normal, Chase.

19:07.798 --> 19:09.844
Who knows what
could be happening,

19:09.887 --> 19:12.542
what I could be doing
during these gaps
in my memories,

19:12.586 --> 19:15.850
[Sigh]
who I could be?

19:15.893 --> 19:18.331
What do you mean by that?

19:18.374 --> 19:20.115
OK.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.856
Look at my father.

19:23.423 --> 19:26.252
One minute, the man

19:26.295 --> 19:29.211
was an abusive monster.

19:29.255 --> 19:31.170
I mean, he would--
he would beat me

19:31.213 --> 19:33.259
if I missed a few
notes at piano

19:33.302 --> 19:35.261
or I spilled soda
on my shirt

19:35.304 --> 19:37.088
or sometimes...

19:37.132 --> 19:38.916
just for
no reason at all.

19:40.309 --> 19:41.484
And then...
[Snaps fingers]

19:41.528 --> 19:43.225
just like that,

19:43.269 --> 19:45.793
he would snap
right back to
this perfect dad,

19:45.836 --> 19:48.796
who was warm
and loving and...

19:50.711 --> 19:52.539
caring, even.

19:52.582 --> 19:58.240
And he would look around
like, "What happened?

19:58.284 --> 20:00.721
"Who tore up
your sheet music?

20:00.764 --> 20:03.637
Why are you
crying, Harvey?"

20:03.680 --> 20:06.205
And, "How'd you get that
bruise on your face?"

20:09.295 --> 20:11.993
And he would
just rush over

20:12.036 --> 20:13.908
and make sure I was OK,

20:13.951 --> 20:16.867
and I knew that
he loved me and...

20:18.826 --> 20:20.480
I loved him.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.006
But that monster...

20:27.617 --> 20:29.489
that was just as real.

20:31.186 --> 20:32.579
Harvey.

20:33.841 --> 20:36.800
Just because you are
experiencing memory loss

20:36.844 --> 20:40.151
does not mean
you inherited your
father's disorder.

20:40.195 --> 20:42.676
In fact, it is
highly unlikely.

20:42.719 --> 20:44.460
A disorder like his
typically manifests

20:44.504 --> 20:46.419
at a much earlier age.

20:46.462 --> 20:48.986
You'd know by now
if you had it.

20:50.771 --> 20:53.252
Then what the hell
is happening to me?

20:53.295 --> 20:54.949
Our bodies are
very smart,

20:54.992 --> 20:58.300
and sometimes,
when you're overwhelmed,

20:58.344 --> 21:01.216
your brain senses a threat

21:01.260 --> 21:05.220
and it shuts down
that part of itself
to protect you.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.135
It's a trauma response.

21:07.178 --> 21:09.616
There's really
nothing--

21:09.659 --> 21:12.314
nothing you're
concerned about here?

21:12.358 --> 21:15.448
I think your anxiety
is off the charts.

21:16.536 --> 21:18.538
I'm gonna write you
a prescription

21:18.581 --> 21:21.236
to help you manage it.

21:21.280 --> 21:26.023
And then I am going
to write a check

21:26.067 --> 21:28.548
for a campaign donation.

21:28.591 --> 21:29.766
[Tears paper]

21:29.810 --> 21:31.942
Gotham needs you,
Harvey.

21:35.250 --> 21:37.339
It's been an honor
to speak to you all today,

21:37.383 --> 21:41.735
and thank you again for coming
and for your continued support.

21:41.778 --> 21:42.953
Whoo!

21:45.652 --> 21:48.089
[Classical music playing,
indistinct chatter]

21:48.132 --> 21:51.658
Excuse me. Great speech.

21:51.701 --> 21:53.312
Do you know my daughter--
Carrie Kelley?

21:53.355 --> 21:55.662
I can't seem
to find her anywhere.

21:55.705 --> 21:57.359
Stephanie: Dr. Kelley.
Dr. Kelley: Yes.

21:57.403 --> 22:01.189
Carrie is, uh,
around here somewhere,

22:01.232 --> 22:04.975
um, and if I see her,
I will send her your way.

22:05.019 --> 22:06.890
OK.

22:09.545 --> 22:11.634
Man: Excuse me.
Dr. Kelley?

22:11.678 --> 22:12.853
Dr. Kelley: Yes.
Man: Caleb Pearce.

22:12.896 --> 22:15.595
Oh. So nice to see you.

22:15.638 --> 22:17.553
You are Carrie's
history teacher.

22:17.597 --> 22:20.513
Yes. Good memory.
[Both chuckle]

22:20.556 --> 22:22.515
I was hoping to, um,
chat with the two of you.

22:22.558 --> 22:24.647
Actually, I was just
looking for Carrie.

22:24.691 --> 22:26.257
Have you seen her?

22:26.301 --> 22:28.347
Not yet, no.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.392
It's not like her to miss
something like this.

22:30.436 --> 22:32.916
Well, that's actually
what I wanted
to talk to you about.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.831
This kind of absence

22:34.875 --> 22:37.356
has been a bit of
a pattern for her lately.

22:39.096 --> 22:41.055
Harper: As you probably
heard from the news,

22:41.098 --> 22:43.710
I was--we--were
wrongfully accused

22:43.753 --> 22:45.320
of Bruce Wayne's murder,

22:45.364 --> 22:46.887
and as we were getting
together a plan,

22:46.930 --> 22:48.062
I was like, Hey,

22:48.105 --> 22:50.369
you know who's
really good at smuggling

22:50.412 --> 22:52.719
all sorts of stuff
outside of the city?

22:52.762 --> 22:54.851
My good friend Dylan.

22:54.895 --> 22:57.767
Friend? That's
not really the word

22:57.811 --> 22:59.595
that I would use
to describe
our relationship,

22:59.639 --> 23:01.945
but then again...

23:01.989 --> 23:03.817
soon as you got
the money from
our job, you split.

23:03.860 --> 23:06.559
Cullen: Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa. Back up. Job?

23:06.602 --> 23:08.212
As in, you worked
for the mob?

23:08.256 --> 23:10.040
We prefer
family business.

23:10.084 --> 23:12.565
Harper: You're right,
Dylan. I...

23:12.608 --> 23:14.871
wasn't committed enough
in our relationship,

23:14.915 --> 23:16.569
but I guess
I didn't realize

23:16.612 --> 23:18.571
how strongly
you felt about me.

23:18.614 --> 23:20.268
That's the only reason
I said "friend" earlier.

23:20.311 --> 23:23.532
Duela: Maybe you should stop
using the word "friend."

23:23.576 --> 23:25.229
I trusted you,
Harper,

23:25.273 --> 23:27.144
and you just left.

23:27.188 --> 23:28.798
No warning,
no discussion.

23:28.842 --> 23:31.932
Really messes with
a man's head, you know?

23:31.975 --> 23:33.237
[Snickers softly]

23:33.281 --> 23:35.239
You are completely correct.

23:35.283 --> 23:36.893
You know she has
abandonment issues.

23:36.937 --> 23:38.765
Probably explains
why she left so quick.

23:38.808 --> 23:40.288
Sorry. Who are you?

23:40.331 --> 23:44.074
Cullen, her brother.

23:45.206 --> 23:46.773
You have a brother?

23:49.558 --> 23:51.517
Never mentioned me, huh?

23:51.560 --> 23:53.040
You know what,
Harper?

23:53.083 --> 23:54.650
You treat people like
they're disposable.

23:54.694 --> 23:57.044
You're always so focused
on the next thing.

23:57.087 --> 23:59.699
You're so closed off,
I never even had
a chance.

24:00.656 --> 24:04.007
I-I really
am sorry, Dylan.

24:04.051 --> 24:06.967
Well, just like you're
not into commitment,

24:07.010 --> 24:09.099
I'm not into apologies.

24:09.143 --> 24:11.275
Lucky for you,

24:11.319 --> 24:13.452
it's nothing
reward money can't fix.

24:15.323 --> 24:16.890
Good news, boys.

24:16.933 --> 24:18.892
We just caught
Bruce Wayne's killers.

24:18.935 --> 24:21.155
Dylan on radio: We're
over in Warehouse Two.

24:23.070 --> 24:24.637
[Banging on door]
Wait, Dylan, please.

24:24.680 --> 24:26.334
You can't turn us in.

24:26.377 --> 24:28.641
It's nothing personal.

24:28.684 --> 24:32.340
Oh, wait.
That's right. It is.

24:32.383 --> 24:33.646
Uhh!

24:33.689 --> 24:35.865
[Both grunting]

24:38.868 --> 24:41.305
Thank you.
I just couldn't listen
to this guy anymore.

24:41.349 --> 24:43.264
[Indistinct shouting outside]

24:43.307 --> 24:45.788
And it sounds like
we're about
to get company.

24:45.832 --> 24:48.530
Man on radio:
Hey, Dylan, open up.

24:48.574 --> 24:49.879
[Beeping]

24:49.923 --> 24:51.664
OK. I just jammed
the door's frequency.

24:51.707 --> 24:53.317
Better lock down
any other entry points,

24:53.361 --> 24:54.841
make sure they
can't get in.

24:54.884 --> 24:57.147
Mm-hmm. And now
we can't get out.

24:57.191 --> 25:00.107
[Banging on door]
Man: Open up!

25:04.503 --> 25:07.288
[Indistinct shouting]

25:07.331 --> 25:09.682
Clingiest mobster ever.

25:09.725 --> 25:12.032
[Banging on door]

25:12.075 --> 25:15.252
That door's not gonna
hold them for long.

25:15.296 --> 25:17.951
Hello. D-bags?

25:17.994 --> 25:20.344
Now, unless you want
to explain to your boss

25:20.388 --> 25:22.869
why her son is roasting
over a nice bonfire

25:22.912 --> 25:24.740
made out of all this cash,

25:24.784 --> 25:28.091
I kindly suggest
you back the hell off.

25:28.135 --> 25:29.353
[Banging on door]

25:29.397 --> 25:32.487
Man: Come on, stop!
[Banging stops]

25:32.531 --> 25:34.924
[Indistinct conversation
outside]

25:34.968 --> 25:36.665
Good thinking.
Bought us some time.

25:36.709 --> 25:38.275
Yeah, but how much?

25:38.319 --> 25:41.452
Long enough to tell
me about that
part-time mob job?

25:41.496 --> 25:44.107
[Cell phone vibrating]

25:44.151 --> 25:46.545
And, apparently,
my mom made it

25:46.588 --> 25:49.199
to the Parents' Luncheon
after all.

25:49.243 --> 25:51.201
Harper: Cullen, seriously,
now is the not the time

25:51.245 --> 25:52.638
for any of this.

25:52.681 --> 25:53.987
I mean,

25:54.030 --> 25:56.163
what the hell
were you thinking?

25:56.206 --> 25:57.904
Can we please
talk about this
when we're not

25:57.947 --> 25:59.558
in a standoff
with armed gunmen, OK?

25:59.601 --> 26:01.081
It was one time
over a year ago.

26:01.124 --> 26:03.170
Trust me.
Just let it go.

26:03.213 --> 26:05.738
Trust you?

26:05.781 --> 26:07.609
Harper, you lied to me.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.524
We swore we'd always
be honest with each other

26:09.568 --> 26:11.091
because no one else was.

26:11.134 --> 26:12.701
And I am, I swear,

26:12.745 --> 26:14.442
but we needed the money,
and I knew you
wouldn't be on board,

26:14.485 --> 26:16.662
so, better to ask for
forgiveness than permission.

26:16.705 --> 26:18.751
You never asked me
for either.

26:18.794 --> 26:20.230
I'm just finding out
about this now.

26:20.274 --> 26:21.928
What else are you
not telling me?

26:21.971 --> 26:23.582
Harper: Cullen.
Cullen: I mean, you just decided

26:23.625 --> 26:25.409
to take this insane
risk by yourself,

26:25.453 --> 26:27.281
and you were
so caught up with me
going into the GCPD,

26:27.324 --> 26:29.326
saying it was dangerous
and all that.

26:29.370 --> 26:31.851
How the hell is this
anything different?

26:31.894 --> 26:33.766
Cullen,
you don't understand.

26:33.809 --> 26:36.595
What did you possibly
think was worth getting
mixed up with the mob?

26:36.638 --> 26:38.118
You, Cullen.

26:40.990 --> 26:42.731
What the hell
are you talking about?

26:42.775 --> 26:45.255
I did it for you.

26:47.214 --> 26:49.433
I took the job

26:49.477 --> 26:51.610
to pay for
your top surgery.

26:53.046 --> 26:55.526
You told me you stole
that money from Dad.

26:55.570 --> 26:57.572
Like he ever had
any money left

26:57.616 --> 27:00.183
after the booze
and the horses.

27:00.227 --> 27:02.272
I let you believe
it was from him

27:02.316 --> 27:06.799
because I knew
you'd react this way
if you knew the truth.

27:12.500 --> 27:13.806
[Laughs]

27:13.849 --> 27:15.677
You guys are so fun.

27:15.721 --> 27:17.940
Like, I-I remember
when I was your age.

27:17.984 --> 27:20.551
Mm, the stuff we got up to.

27:20.595 --> 27:22.162
Surprised I'm not in jail.

27:22.205 --> 27:23.816
Stephanie: Excuse us.
Mom: Oh.

27:23.859 --> 27:26.601
OK, Mom, I think it's
time to go home.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.559
Hey. I just met
your friends.

27:28.603 --> 27:31.345
They are so nice,
especially that Brody.

27:31.388 --> 27:33.260
You want to
hang on to that boy.

27:33.303 --> 27:34.565
Mom.

27:34.609 --> 27:36.480
Well, he's better
than that Turner kid,

27:36.524 --> 27:38.308
who had his
own father killed.

27:38.352 --> 27:40.528
You looking for
pointers to use on me?

27:40.571 --> 27:42.008
Don't tempt me.
[Mother chuckles]

27:42.051 --> 27:44.010
I'm gonna call you
a cab.

27:44.053 --> 27:46.447
Please. You know,
you couldn't be bothered

27:46.490 --> 27:48.623
to bring me anything
better than a club soda,

27:48.667 --> 27:51.191
so, I'm just fine
to drive, thank you.

27:51.234 --> 27:53.193
Please. Mom.

28:10.601 --> 28:12.386
[Shuts off engine]

Hello?

29:09.008 --> 29:10.661
[Mozart's "Fantasia in D Minor"
playing]

29:10.705 --> 29:13.360
Hello? Who is this?

29:13.403 --> 29:15.449
[Music continues]

29:17.930 --> 29:21.281
Hey. We can't just
wait them out forever.
What's the plan?

29:21.324 --> 29:23.196
Uh, you could let him
take your hand in marriage

29:23.239 --> 29:25.198
and become part of
the family.

29:25.241 --> 29:27.766
[Cell phone vibrates]
Oh, no. It's my mom.

29:27.809 --> 29:29.332
What? OK, well,
do not answer it.

29:29.376 --> 29:31.291
Oh, no, I think
I have to,

29:31.334 --> 29:34.598
or else she's
gonna know something's
up, so, just--

29:34.642 --> 29:35.904
Duela: What?
Carrie: Hi, Mom.

29:35.948 --> 29:39.603
I made it to school.
Where are you?

29:39.647 --> 29:41.388
I'm at a study group.

29:41.431 --> 29:43.912
Man on radio: You can't
stay in there forever.

29:43.956 --> 29:45.435
What is that noise?

29:45.479 --> 29:47.394
That doesn't sound
like studying to me.

29:47.437 --> 29:49.178
Carrie: It's my study buddies.
They're crazy.

29:49.222 --> 29:50.658
They're just, like,
really passionate about

29:50.701 --> 29:53.052
the history of
the Irish Republican Army.

29:53.095 --> 29:56.185
I switched to
the late shift tonight.

29:56.229 --> 29:59.275
You better be back
by the time I get home.

29:59.319 --> 30:01.408
I promise.

30:01.451 --> 30:03.627
Bye. Bye.

30:03.671 --> 30:05.891
[Sirens outside]

30:11.548 --> 30:13.986
OK, OK, so, did things
just get better or worse?

30:14.029 --> 30:15.552
The McKillens have cops
on their payroll.

30:15.596 --> 30:17.380
Good morning, fellas.

30:17.424 --> 30:18.599
Good morning.

30:18.642 --> 30:20.949
Trust me, things
definitely just got worse.

30:36.269 --> 30:38.837
Officer on P.A.:
This is the GCPD.

30:38.880 --> 30:41.143
We can do this the peaceful way

30:41.187 --> 30:42.841
or the fun way.

30:42.884 --> 30:44.103
Your call.

30:44.146 --> 30:46.061
Won't be long
before Gotham's Finest

30:46.105 --> 30:47.541
comes bursting
through that door.

30:47.584 --> 30:49.891
Well, being reckless
got us into this.

30:49.935 --> 30:52.720
We're gonna have to be
reckless to get us out.

the damn money.

I'd like to be alive

32:07.360 --> 32:09.362
to spend some of
this money, thank you.

to them.

What's going on
up there?

32:30.122 --> 32:31.558
They're coming up
too fast.

32:31.601 --> 32:32.820
Well, if we can't speed up,
we're gonna

32:32.863 --> 32:34.735
have to slow them down.

32:38.521 --> 32:41.002
What the hell
are you doing?

-Uhh!

No! What are
you doing?

33:09.117 --> 33:11.554
You are literally
throwing money away.

33:11.598 --> 33:13.556
If those cops catch us,
they're not gonna
let you keep it.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.341
It is not
our money to keep.

33:15.384 --> 33:17.386
It is the people
of Gotham's.

Cullen: No. Duela!

No. no.
No, this one is mine!

Cullen: She did it.
You did it, Harper.

34:19.274 --> 34:21.101
Harper: Yes!
Cullen: You did it!

34:26.107 --> 34:27.848
We go now to news
out of the East End,

34:27.891 --> 34:29.632
where a group of
unknown vigilantes
have littered the streets

34:29.676 --> 34:31.634
with millions of dollars' worth
of cash.

34:31.678 --> 34:33.940
The money is believed to be
the ill-gotten gains

34:33.984 --> 34:36.552
of alleged crime family
the McKillens.

34:36.596 --> 34:39.425
East Enders all know
the McKillens have been

34:39.467 --> 34:42.428
holding the local businesses
hostage for decades.

34:42.471 --> 34:44.777
Just got worse after
the Dark Knight got killed.

34:44.821 --> 34:48.303
Bartender on TV: Seems to me
Gotham got some new knights.

34:48.347 --> 34:49.956
While the identity
of these so-called

34:50.000 --> 34:51.741
"Gotham Knights"
remains unknown,

34:51.784 --> 34:53.786
after today's
redistribution of wealth,

34:53.830 --> 34:55.702
Gotham is one step closer
to ending

34:55.745 --> 34:57.747
the McKillens' reign of terror,

34:57.791 --> 34:59.923
and it seems we have
a new generation

34:59.967 --> 35:01.708
of protectors to thank for it.

35:01.751 --> 35:02.970
Ever since--
[Turns TV off]

35:04.493 --> 35:06.278
Turner: We all just
saw that, right?
That happened?

35:06.321 --> 35:09.411
Yup. All those people
got our money.

35:09.455 --> 35:10.978
And they think
we did it out

35:11.021 --> 35:12.632
of the goodness
of our hearts.

35:12.675 --> 35:14.895
They called us
the Gotham Knights.

35:14.938 --> 35:16.810
I'll take that over
"Bruce Wayne's killers."

35:16.853 --> 35:18.986
What do you think's gonna
happen when they realize

35:19.029 --> 35:21.989
their new heroes are also
their most wanted fugitives?

Dude. Your art.

36:57.171 --> 36:59.739
You really
blow me away sometimes.

37:01.784 --> 37:04.570
I had no idea just
how much you've
done for me...

37:06.311 --> 37:08.008
how much you've
risked.

37:09.488 --> 37:12.186
I just want
to say thank you.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.623
This is why
I didn't tell you.

37:14.667 --> 37:17.844
I didn't want you
blaming yourself
for my choice.

37:19.454 --> 37:20.934
I could see how hard
things were for you

37:20.977 --> 37:24.894
before the surgery,
and it was like...

37:24.938 --> 37:28.158
we got away from Dad,

37:28.202 --> 37:30.204
but you were
still trapped.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.989
So, getting you
that money

37:33.033 --> 37:35.209
was a no-brainer.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.255
And I would do it again.

37:38.908 --> 37:41.259
Seriously, Harper,
thank you.

37:43.478 --> 37:45.480
Well, I feel better
when my brother is happy,

37:45.524 --> 37:47.569
so, really,
it was for me.

37:47.613 --> 37:49.528
[Chuckles softly]

37:51.878 --> 37:53.619
But...

37:53.662 --> 37:55.795
There's a "but"
to your "thank you"?

37:57.623 --> 38:01.104
That Dylan guy.
He was a total himbo,

38:01.148 --> 38:03.846
who you were way
too good for, by the way.

38:05.413 --> 38:07.241
But he was right
about one thing.

38:07.285 --> 38:10.984
While you're busy
doing everything
for everyone else,

38:11.027 --> 38:12.855
don't close yourself
off to having

38:12.899 --> 38:15.554
something or someone
for yourself.

38:15.597 --> 38:17.599
You deserve it.

38:30.525 --> 38:33.180
Gotta say...

38:33.223 --> 38:36.575
I don't utterly loathe
this new Bat-Brat.

38:36.618 --> 38:39.142
You gotta work on
the compliment thing.

38:39.186 --> 38:40.970
Well, it's not
a compliment.

38:41.014 --> 38:42.668
It's an observation.

38:42.711 --> 38:45.148
So, you're observing me?

38:45.192 --> 38:47.499
Oh, I'm always watching.

what I don't see.

Guardrails.
Safety nets.

39:02.775 --> 39:04.429
You're outside of
your comfort zone,

39:04.472 --> 39:05.952
and I think
you like it there.

39:05.995 --> 39:08.607
Maybe Harper's right and
I'm just getting careless.

39:08.650 --> 39:10.435
Or maybe you got
betrayed.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.700
Yeah, I know
a little bit about that.

39:17.180 --> 39:18.834
It's always the ones
right in front of you

to be a one-bitch
sleeper cell

39:25.101 --> 39:29.192
and took away the last person
you thought you could rely on.

39:29.236 --> 39:31.369
Here's the good news.

39:31.412 --> 39:34.197
When you've got
no one left to trust,

39:34.241 --> 39:36.809
you learn how
to trust yourself.

39:40.116 --> 39:41.988
Well, if that means
not playing by
the rules anymore,

39:42.031 --> 39:43.642

39:43.685 --> 39:45.644
The people who pull
the strings in Gotham

39:45.687 --> 39:47.733
don't play by 'em,
so, why should you?

39:47.776 --> 39:50.518
Now we just gotta
follow those strings

39:50.562 --> 39:52.738
back to The Court of Owls.

39:52.781 --> 39:55.305
About that.
We have a problem.

So, just like we thought,
the McKillens' ledger

39:58.091 --> 40:00.441
shows tons of money
being filtered through
their operation.

40:00.485 --> 40:02.400
But it's just
a bunch of numbers.

40:02.443 --> 40:04.358
It's a ledger.
It's gonna have numbers.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.968
It's all numbers.

40:06.012 --> 40:09.058
Not just the dollar amounts,
the recipients, too.

40:09.102 --> 40:10.886
It's written in code.

40:10.930 --> 40:13.149
Then we have to find
a way to crack it.

40:13.193 --> 40:15.369
Yeah, it's
a complex cipher that's
gonna be tough to break.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.284
Maybe not for
someone who grew up
solving puzzles

40:17.327 --> 40:19.199

himself.

to the city.

in an hour.

with that hour...

do this again.

The one where you say,
"We can't do this again,"

but when
it suits your needs,

and call and call,
