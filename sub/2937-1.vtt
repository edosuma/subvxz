"Travel is useful. It exercises the imagination.
All the rest is disappointment and fatigue.

01:26.504 --> 01:28.673
Our journey is entirely imaginary.
That is its strength.

01:28.840 --> 01:32.010
It goes from life to death.
People, animals, cities, things- all are imagined.

01:32.177 --> 01:35.638
It's a novel, just a fictitious narrative.
Littré says so, and he's never wrong.

01:35.764 --> 01:39.517
Besides, anyone can do it.
You just have to close your eyes.

01:39.684 --> 01:41.644
It's on the other side of life."

01:41.770 --> 01:44.105
Céline - <i>Journey to the End of the Night</i>

01:48.359 --> 01:49.861
Fire!

03:14.237 --> 03:17.115
You're a real pain in the ass.

05:23.449 --> 05:24.492
Enough!

05:24.659 --> 05:27.578
They even have cocktails with cherries. Remember?

05:27.745 --> 05:28.997
Hey, jerks!

05:30.123 --> 05:31.916
I'll fuck you!

05:32.959 --> 05:34.419
I'll fuck you!

05:53.021 --> 05:55.356
Have you seen Ermanno?

06:51.162 --> 06:54.665
- I'm gonna fuck you now, you hear?
- Get lost!

07:32.245 --> 07:34.622
What the hell are you doing?

08:07.697 --> 08:09.574
My phone's been stolen!

08:55.119 --> 08:57.538
I'm starring in two TV dramas.

08:57.663 --> 08:59.790
I'm playing a pope in one,

08:59.916 --> 09:02.877
and in the other a junkie
on the road to recovery.

09:03.044 --> 09:05.046
Very impressive.

09:05.254 --> 09:06.881
Any theater work?

09:07.048 --> 09:10.009
I'm supposed to do some Shakespeare with Pietro,

09:10.134 --> 09:12.637
but it has to be at least three hours long,

09:12.803 --> 09:14.847
an ambitious project,

09:15.014 --> 09:17.475
and no more small cities.

09:17.892 --> 09:21.896
I'm trying to write a theater piece.
The concept is-

09:22.063 --> 09:25.983
- What about you?
- I might give up acting.

09:26.317 --> 09:29.695
In this shitty country there are never
any good female roles.

09:29.904 --> 09:32.782
I'll work on my first novel,
a Proustian piece.

09:32.907 --> 09:35.910
No kidding!
Proust's my favorite writer.

09:36.077 --> 09:38.246
Along with Ammaniti.

09:39.038 --> 09:40.706
What a coincidence.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.299
Who's that woman?

09:50.508 --> 09:52.426
You don't know? It's Lorena.

09:52.969 --> 09:54.178
Who?

09:54.428 --> 09:58.599
A former TV showgirl, now in full
physical and mental decline.

09:58.724 --> 10:02.937
I've never seen her before.
But then, I've never had a TV.

10:03.104 --> 10:04.814
Viola, I know that.

10:04.939 --> 10:07.858
You remind me at least once a day.

10:08.025 --> 10:10.528
- What does she do now?
- Nothing.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.699
Happy birthday, Jep!

10:14.824 --> 10:16.784
Happy birthday, Rome!

10:28.004 --> 10:30.506
Happy birthday, Jep!

11:02.705 --> 11:05.416
<i>La Colita!</i>

12:27.706 --> 12:31.085
<i>To this question, as kids,</i>

12:31.293 --> 12:34.713
<i>my friends always gave the same answer:</i>

12:35.172 --> 12:37.091
<i>Pussy.</i>

12:37.508 --> 12:39.802
<i>Whereas I answered...</i>

12:39.927 --> 12:42.513
<i>"The smell of old people's houses."</i>

12:43.222 --> 12:45.182
<i>The question was...</i>

12:45.349 --> 12:49.895
<i>"What do you really like most in life?"</i>

12:50.855 --> 12:54.275
<i>I was destined to be a sensitive type.</i>

12:54.859 --> 12:58.654
<i>I was destined to become a writer.</i>

12:59.029 --> 13:01.532
<i>I was destined to become</i>

13:01.657 --> 13:04.034
<i>Jep Gambardella.</i>

13:10.249 --> 13:12.960
THE GREAT BEAUTY

13:14.211 --> 13:16.338
You paid no attention to me tonight.

13:16.464 --> 13:18.424
Romano, don't start moaning.

13:18.549 --> 13:20.634
We're not an item.

13:20.885 --> 13:23.888
- Did you like that guy?
- I like everyone and no one.

13:24.054 --> 13:26.599
And when it's no one, it's my turn.

13:26.724 --> 13:30.519
- Will you take me to the airport?
- Sure! What time do you leave?

13:31.937 --> 13:33.481
In three hours.

13:33.606 --> 13:35.232
Three hours?

13:35.399 --> 13:37.985
Then maybe I better crash on your sofa-

13:38.152 --> 13:39.445
Go home.

13:39.570 --> 13:43.073
I have to pack,
and I don't like people around.

13:43.240 --> 13:46.076
- But I live so far away.
- See you at 8:00.

13:52.833 --> 13:53.876
Good night.

14:09.141 --> 14:10.976
Guys?

14:28.494 --> 14:30.246
Guys?

14:47.221 --> 14:48.889
Children!

15:17.918 --> 15:19.587
Go on.

16:19.438 --> 16:21.398
<i>Catellani?</i>

16:23.192 --> 16:25.027
The best, of course.

16:27.237 --> 16:30.741
I mean, did Catellani the tailor

16:30.866 --> 16:32.534
make your suit?

17:23.127 --> 17:26.171
<i>There was no doubt
as to Malagna's shady intentions.</i>

17:26.338 --> 17:30.801
<i>The girl had to be rescued immediately,
at all costs.</i>

17:32.052 --> 17:33.470
Sir, you drank.

17:33.637 --> 17:35.723
Just enough to forget my birthday.

17:35.848 --> 17:39.143
- You want herbal tea?
- Absolutely, chérie.

17:40.728 --> 17:43.230
- I got you a present.
- How sweet.

17:43.397 --> 17:45.816
A lucky charm from my country.

17:47.943 --> 17:51.405
Good thing it's lucky,
'cause it's ugly as hell.

17:51.530 --> 17:54.366
Keep it on your nightstand
and stop complaining.

17:54.533 --> 17:56.368
Verily. And thanks.

17:56.493 --> 17:58.829
Wake me at 3:00 p.m., you rascal.

17:59.163 --> 18:01.331
Makes me laugh when you call me that.

21:25.953 --> 21:28.622
I don't love you!

21:43.178 --> 21:45.472
Did you enjoy the performance?

21:47.516 --> 21:49.267
Parts of it.

21:49.476 --> 21:52.062
That violent head-butt explains a lot.

21:52.229 --> 21:54.231
- Let's start at the beginning.
- Why not the end?

21:55.023 --> 21:57.985
You know, Talia Concept loves to provoke.

21:58.110 --> 22:01.196
Don't bother. There are
more important things than provoking me.

22:01.321 --> 22:04.950
And this referring to yourself
in the third person is unbearable.

22:05.075 --> 22:06.660
What are you reading?

22:06.868 --> 22:10.288
I don't need to read. I live on vibrations,
including extrasensory ones.

22:10.414 --> 22:14.418
Setting the extrasensory aside for a moment,

22:14.543 --> 22:16.670
what do you mean by "vibrations"?

22:16.878 --> 22:18.422
How does one use

22:18.547 --> 22:22.092
the crude vulgarity of words
to explain the poetry of vibrations?

22:22.926 --> 22:24.970
Well, try.

22:25.095 --> 22:27.180
I'm an artist.
I don't need to explain jack shit.

22:27.305 --> 22:32.102
Then I'll write, "Lives on vibrations
but doesn't know what they are."

22:32.477 --> 22:36.606
I'm starting to dislike this interview.
I sense conflict in you.

22:36.732 --> 22:40.235
- Conflict as a vibration?
- As a pain in the ass.

22:40.444 --> 22:43.155
Let's discuss how my mother's boyfriend abused me.

22:43.280 --> 22:47.034
No! I want to know what vibrations are.

22:50.454 --> 22:52.706
They're my radar for listening in on the world.

22:52.831 --> 22:54.958
Your radar... meaning?

22:56.126 --> 22:58.295
You're a pain in the ass.

22:58.462 --> 23:00.380
We got off to a bad start.

23:00.505 --> 23:04.676
Talia Concept wants to be interviewed
by your paper. It has lots of readers.

23:04.885 --> 23:06.511
But you're biased.

23:06.678 --> 23:10.515
Write about how she has sex
with her boyfriend 11 times a day.

23:10.682 --> 23:12.517
He's a talented conceptual artist.

23:12.684 --> 23:15.687
He covers basketballs in confetti.
It's sensational.

23:15.812 --> 23:19.316
Talia Concept is talking about things
she doesn't understand.

23:19.441 --> 23:22.194
All I've heard so far is unpublishable fluff.

23:22.319 --> 23:26.531
If you think I'll fall for
"I'm an artist, I don't need to explain,"

23:26.656 --> 23:27.824
you're mistaken.

23:27.949 --> 23:30.118
Our paper has a very educated readership

23:30.243 --> 23:33.038
that won't be taken for fools.
I work for them.

23:33.163 --> 23:35.665
Then let me talk
about my eventful and difficult

23:35.791 --> 23:38.752
but necessary journey as an artist!

23:38.919 --> 23:40.420
Necessary for whom?

23:40.545 --> 23:45.133
For heaven's sake, ma'am,
what is a vibration?

23:46.051 --> 23:49.387
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

23:49.554 --> 23:51.515
You're an obsessive jerk!

23:51.723 --> 23:55.727
I'll tell your editor to send me
a journalist of greater stature.

23:55.894 --> 23:58.980
A word of advice:
When you speak with her,

23:59.106 --> 24:02.818
go easy on the stature business.
She's a dwarf.

24:04.694 --> 24:07.322
Jep, this interview is a hoot!

24:07.447 --> 24:10.492
Maybe, but it's the last time
I interview someone

24:10.617 --> 24:12.619
who head-butts walls.

24:12.911 --> 24:16.039
- You find out her trick?
- Foam rubber.

24:16.164 --> 24:18.125
Amateur theatrics never die.

24:18.250 --> 24:22.045
You weren't offended by the stature thing, right?

24:22.337 --> 24:25.841
Don't be silly. That's the funniest part.

24:26.133 --> 24:28.218
I'm a dwarf. Why not say so?

24:28.343 --> 24:31.555
It's the first and last thing
everyone says about me.

24:31.721 --> 24:35.058
You're a spectacular woman, Dadina.
You've had the career you deserve.

24:35.183 --> 24:38.728
But you haven't, Jep.

24:39.479 --> 24:42.107
Maybe I just don't have much to say.

24:42.232 --> 24:44.234
Bullshit. You're just lazy.

24:44.359 --> 24:46.361
You never leave Rome.

24:46.486 --> 24:48.989
Go to Giglio and do that report
on the Concordia

24:49.114 --> 24:51.366
I've asked you to do 50 times.

24:54.619 --> 24:58.123
Rice is always tastier reheated
than freshly cooked, eh?

24:58.248 --> 25:00.834
The old is better than the new.

25:01.751 --> 25:03.753
Plans tonight, chérie?

25:03.920 --> 25:07.424
As the great De Blasi,
my predecessor, would say,

25:07.591 --> 25:11.595
"Tonight I'm going to have
some nice soup and a good screw."

25:11.761 --> 25:13.972
Two things that contradict each other.

25:14.181 --> 25:17.517
That's what I'd always say,
and she'd reply, in a serious tone,

25:17.642 --> 25:19.603
"No, Dadina, they don't,

25:19.728 --> 25:21.813
because they're both hot."

25:24.107 --> 25:27.444
<i>There's a decent-sized
publishing house in Ancona</i>

25:27.652 --> 25:30.238
that really wants a book of interviews with you.

25:30.363 --> 25:34.075
Another interview book?
They interview everyone in this country!

25:34.201 --> 25:37.245
Can't you just hear them?
"As I always say"... to whom?

25:37.454 --> 25:38.872
Let's forget it.

25:39.039 --> 25:41.750
And honestly, who'll buy a book called

25:41.875 --> 25:44.920
<i>Visions and Revisions:
Jep Gambardella's Galaxy?</i>

25:45.045 --> 25:47.047
It's a serious title!

25:47.255 --> 25:50.133
And unfortunately, to be taken seriously
in this country,

25:50.258 --> 25:52.260
you have to take yourself seriously.

25:52.385 --> 25:54.763
I only wrote one novel 40 years ago,

25:54.888 --> 25:56.932
and no bookstore carries it.

25:57.057 --> 26:00.101
Bullshit! <i>The Human Apparatus</i> was a masterpiece!

26:00.227 --> 26:02.229
It even won the- What was it?

26:02.354 --> 26:05.106
- The Bancarella prize.
- The friggin' Bancarella!

26:05.232 --> 26:09.236
You're very kind, but let's drop it.
It'd look too presumptuous.

26:09.444 --> 26:12.781
No, we can't. You'll put me
in an awkward position.

26:12.906 --> 26:15.825
I already agreed to it and accepted an advance.

26:15.951 --> 26:17.452
- How much?
- 1,500 euros.

26:17.577 --> 26:20.830
Give it back. I'll give you the 1,500.

26:20.956 --> 26:23.750
By the way, I spoke to the theater people.

26:23.917 --> 26:27.337
They'll give you three nights,
but you pay for the lights.

26:27.504 --> 26:29.381
Who cares about that!

26:29.506 --> 26:31.591
Jep, this is great news.

26:31.716 --> 26:34.261
Really great news. Thanks.

26:40.517 --> 26:42.102
Are you still up?

26:42.310 --> 26:44.354
It's time for bed.

26:44.479 --> 26:47.148
That's Viola Bartoli, Bartoli's widow.

26:47.274 --> 26:49.609
The guy who was killed, the actual Bartoli.

26:49.734 --> 26:53.863
She has a 150-foot yacht
that belonged to Himmler, the nazi.

26:54.322 --> 26:56.324
You know what I call her?

26:56.616 --> 26:59.119
- What?
- "Too Good to Poop."

26:59.452 --> 27:03.039
- I don't understand.
- Because she's persnickety.

27:03.164 --> 27:05.333
Usually persnickety people don't poop.

27:05.458 --> 27:08.753
When I introduced Trumeau to my family,
my father said,

27:08.962 --> 27:12.549
"Miss, before marrying my son,
have you ever seen him poop?"

27:12.757 --> 27:15.552
- That's gross!
- Gross is all in your head.

27:15.677 --> 27:18.263
My wife and I are the only couple in love

27:18.388 --> 27:19.973
right now in Italy.

27:20.140 --> 27:22.142
Orietta, watch out for Lello.

27:22.350 --> 27:23.935
I figured that out.

27:24.102 --> 27:26.980
He's the world's greatest salesman.
He cons everyone.

27:27.147 --> 27:30.233
He'll have you buying
his entire inventory in no time.

27:30.358 --> 27:31.735
He's always flattering me.

27:31.860 --> 27:35.739
The fact I express myself well
doesn't mean I'm always working.

27:35.905 --> 27:37.907
- What do you do?
- I sell toys.

27:38.033 --> 27:40.368
It's not some little toy shop somewhere.

27:40.493 --> 27:43.580
He sells wholesale worldwide,
even to the Chinese.

27:43.747 --> 27:45.081
Who's that guy?

27:45.206 --> 27:47.208
That's Sebastiano Paf,

27:47.334 --> 27:49.544
perhaps Italy's greatest living poet.

27:49.669 --> 27:51.379
He wrote the line...

27:51.504 --> 27:55.258
"Up with life, down with reminiscence."

27:56.259 --> 27:59.095
He's doing the Dukan diet
so that Dadina won't leave him.

27:59.554 --> 28:00.972
Are they a couple?

28:01.139 --> 28:03.266
- He thinks so, but-
- Like in high school.

28:04.392 --> 28:06.269
Why doesn't he ever talk?

28:06.394 --> 28:08.521
Because he listens.

28:10.774 --> 28:14.069
- Stop sucking that shit up your nose!
- Fuck off.

28:14.194 --> 28:16.237
Jep's found a theater for me.

28:16.363 --> 28:20.033
- Want to play the lead?
- I'm not acting anymore.

28:20.158 --> 28:21.701
I'm a writer now.

28:22.410 --> 28:23.953
Maybe...

28:24.621 --> 28:26.623
maybe I'll direct a film.

28:26.748 --> 28:28.166
Viola, darling.

28:28.291 --> 28:30.960
Jep, please help me.
I'm worried about my son.

28:31.127 --> 28:34.297
- What can I do?
- Why don't you talk to him?

28:34.464 --> 28:36.883
You always say you're best with strangers.

28:37.008 --> 28:39.010
We're all best with strangers.

28:39.219 --> 28:43.765
- Is he seeing a therapist?
- Yes, but he wants to stop going.

28:43.890 --> 28:45.892
Take him to a psychiatrist.

28:46.017 --> 28:48.478
They don't waste time:
Ativan, Prozac, all that stuff.

28:48.645 --> 28:50.563
"That stuff" makes him feel worse.

28:50.688 --> 28:54.234
Viola, relax.
The boy's always been a bit odd.

28:54.401 --> 28:56.986
Listen, have you tried Ahé's escarole pie?

28:57.153 --> 28:59.572
It's the first time that rascal's made it,

28:59.697 --> 29:01.950
and it came out better than my mom's.

29:02.075 --> 29:05.036
Do me a favor and try a piece.

29:10.458 --> 29:12.460
You changed your hair color.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.673
I've been feeling Pirandello-esque lately.

29:18.341 --> 29:21.261
- Great jazz, no?
- Not really.

29:21.428 --> 29:25.974
The Ethiopian jazz scene is the only one
I find interesting today.

29:26.099 --> 29:27.100
I'm from Milan.

29:27.559 --> 29:29.477
To be honest, I find Romans...

29:29.769 --> 29:31.187
unbearable.

29:31.312 --> 29:34.065
The best people in Rome are the tourists.

29:34.190 --> 29:35.692
In all of Italy!

29:35.817 --> 29:39.404
What are we famous for overseas?
Fashion and pizza.

29:39.529 --> 29:42.115
A country of weavers and grocers.

29:42.240 --> 29:46.119
How can someone who sells toys,
bringing joy to the world,

29:46.286 --> 29:49.539
be such a pessimist and a defeatist?
You're so dark.

29:49.706 --> 29:51.291
- Dark?
- Yes.

29:51.541 --> 29:54.377
I heard Gisella Montanelli
went to loan sharks

29:54.544 --> 29:56.254
to pay her hairdressing debts.

29:56.379 --> 29:58.089
Jep says I'm dark.

29:58.214 --> 29:59.841
Gisella's really sunk that low?

29:59.966 --> 30:02.594
Rome is the only city in the world

30:02.719 --> 30:05.346
where Marxism's reached its full potential.

30:05.472 --> 30:08.391
You can't excel over others here
for more than a week.

30:08.516 --> 30:11.769
You're immediately brought back
to the golden mean.

30:11.895 --> 30:15.190
Rome is pure collectivism.

30:15.315 --> 30:18.735
Pure collectivism.
Stefa', what utter nonsense!

30:18.860 --> 30:22.405
You know that Flaubert
wanted to write a book about nothing?

30:22.530 --> 30:25.909
Too bad he never met you.
It would have made a great book.

30:27.076 --> 30:28.745
You're a misogynist.

30:28.870 --> 30:33.041
Stop assuming it's all about you.
I'm not a misogynist. I'm a misanthrope.

30:33.166 --> 30:36.002
Hear, hear!
With hatred, one must aim high.

30:36.127 --> 30:39.214
You're a very dark man.

31:30.348 --> 31:31.975
Lello!

31:32.141 --> 31:34.143
Not stopping tonight?

31:47.782 --> 31:50.159
Mama! When I see you, I blush!

31:51.494 --> 31:52.829
Andrea...

31:54.122 --> 31:56.833
- you're crazy.
- No, I'm not crazy!

31:58.334 --> 32:00.086
I've got problems.

32:01.462 --> 32:04.841
<i>"As the lights flashed,
love sat down in the corner...</i>

32:05.008 --> 32:08.011
shy and distracted as it was.

32:08.177 --> 32:11.014
That's why we could tolerate life no longer."

32:11.180 --> 32:14.392
Good heavens, no one's quoted me in decades!

32:14.517 --> 32:16.978
I read your book as a teenager.
I never forgot the end.

32:17.103 --> 32:18.313
Stop right there.

32:18.438 --> 32:22.150
You're stroking my ego most recklessly.

32:22.275 --> 32:26.362
It's obvious you were deeply in love
when you wrote it.

32:29.115 --> 32:31.868
Moravia made more or less the same comment,

32:32.035 --> 32:35.455
though he stated his case
a bit more elegantly.

32:36.956 --> 32:39.959
I once saw Piazza Navona covered in snow.

32:40.084 --> 32:42.337
Really? What was it like?

32:43.212 --> 32:44.964
White.

32:47.550 --> 32:49.719
This is where I stay in Rome.

32:50.303 --> 32:52.347
Banished to the 'burbs, eh?

32:53.973 --> 32:56.059
What do you do for work?

32:56.184 --> 32:58.227
Me? I'm rich.

32:58.394 --> 33:00.229
Nice work.

33:27.507 --> 33:29.384
You didn't enjoy it.

33:29.509 --> 33:31.928
I know I'm not very good.

33:32.095 --> 33:33.763
Why do you say that?

33:34.263 --> 33:37.183
Besides, it's so sad to be good.

33:37.308 --> 33:39.435
It can become all about technique.

33:40.645 --> 33:43.272
You didn't really seem to be into it.

33:44.941 --> 33:46.734
You're very beautiful, Orietta.

33:46.859 --> 33:48.778
Very, very, very beautiful.

33:48.903 --> 33:51.781
I take pictures of myself, you know.

33:51.906 --> 33:54.992
At all hours of the day,
to get to know myself.

33:55.118 --> 33:58.579
- With my phone and its timer.
- Interesting.

33:58.705 --> 34:01.207
My Facebook friends say
I take great pictures.

34:02.250 --> 34:04.877
I bet you're naked in some of them.

34:06.337 --> 34:08.922
- A few.
- I knew it.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.676
Want to see them?

34:11.801 --> 34:12.927
Sure.

34:13.052 --> 34:15.054
I'll get my computer.

34:27.608 --> 34:30.485
<i>The most important thing I discovered</i>

34:30.610 --> 34:34.364
<i>a few days after turning 65</i>

34:34.489 --> 34:38.661
<i>was that I can't waste any more time
doing things I don't want to do.</i>

35:08.024 --> 35:10.985
<i>When I arrived in Rome</i>

35:11.110 --> 35:13.154
<i>at the age of 26,</i>

35:13.279 --> 35:16.115
<i>I fell fairly swiftly,</i>

35:16.240 --> 35:19.243
<i>almost without realizing it,</i>

35:19.535 --> 35:21.704
<i>into what might be called</i>

35:21.871 --> 35:24.415
<i>"the whirlpool of high society."</i>

35:24.999 --> 35:30.588
<i>But I didn't just want to be part
of high society.</i>

35:30.963 --> 35:32.882
Sacconi should be in charge.

35:33.049 --> 35:35.885
Antonini's a fucking pain in the ass!

35:38.930 --> 35:43.351
<i>I wanted to be the king of high society.</i>

35:43.476 --> 35:45.603
<i>And I succeeded.</i>

35:50.775 --> 35:55.029
<i>I didn't want to just go to parties.</i>

35:57.490 --> 36:01.410
<i>I wanted the power to make or break them.</i>

36:30.898 --> 36:32.942
Gambardella?

36:33.568 --> 36:37.154
Forgive my showing up like this without notice.

36:37.488 --> 36:39.448
I'm Alfredo Marti.

36:39.866 --> 36:42.827
Nice to meet you. I'm Jep.
But I live over here.

36:42.952 --> 36:45.121
No, I don't want to bother you.

36:46.664 --> 36:48.416
How can I help you?

36:49.125 --> 36:51.294
I'm Elisa De Santis's husband.

36:57.717 --> 36:59.802
Did you have children?

37:00.094 --> 37:01.512
No.

37:02.179 --> 37:04.223
I couldn't.

37:05.433 --> 37:07.018
I could.

37:09.604 --> 37:10.938
I could.

37:12.982 --> 37:14.400
I'm sorry.

37:15.318 --> 37:16.944
I'm sorry.

37:18.070 --> 37:20.323
She could have too.

37:21.908 --> 37:23.743
Elisa died.

37:25.202 --> 37:26.746
Yesterday.

37:55.441 --> 37:59.153
Alfre', if I can help in any way.
You know where I live.

38:06.869 --> 38:09.789
Don't leave me alone.
Please don't leave me alone.

38:20.758 --> 38:23.636
<i>We were married for 35 years,</i>

38:23.970 --> 38:27.556
but Elisa always loved you.

38:31.560 --> 38:33.604
What are you talking about?

38:34.397 --> 38:37.650
Elisa and I went out together
when we were kids.

38:38.359 --> 38:42.071
In fact, I think she left me,
but it was so long ago I can't-

38:42.196 --> 38:44.281
Yes, she left you.

38:44.448 --> 38:46.534
On September 8th, 1970.

38:46.659 --> 38:48.202
Exactly.

38:50.579 --> 38:53.374
You're distraught now. That's normal.

38:53.499 --> 38:55.501
I'm not distraught.

38:55.668 --> 38:59.755
Elisa only loved one man in her life.

39:00.339 --> 39:03.092
- You.
- How can you say that?

39:03.217 --> 39:06.262
I never saw Elisa again.
You two spent a lifetime together.

39:06.721 --> 39:09.849
I found a diary of hers, with a lock.

39:12.685 --> 39:15.021
And I broke the lock off.

39:15.187 --> 39:18.441
Alfredo, I write for a living.

39:18.816 --> 39:20.026
Believe me...

39:21.235 --> 39:25.573
when you write, you give life
to fantasies, imagination, lies.

39:25.698 --> 39:29.285
I was just a good companion.

39:30.327 --> 39:33.456
That's all she wrote about me.

39:34.957 --> 39:37.710
Thirty-five years together...

39:38.461 --> 39:43.049
and I'm mentioned in two lines
as a good companion.

39:49.305 --> 39:50.890
Here.

39:59.148 --> 40:01.275
What will you do now?

40:02.234 --> 40:04.111
What I've always done.

40:06.155 --> 40:08.407
<i>I'll go on worshipping her.</i>

40:45.945 --> 40:47.988
What's he doing?

40:48.114 --> 40:49.615
Stop!

40:51.117 --> 40:52.701
Jep!

41:20.729 --> 41:22.565
You did it!

41:38.622 --> 41:42.293
- Have you seen my daughter?
- Your daughter? No.

41:47.423 --> 41:49.216
Francesca.

42:09.987 --> 42:11.697
<i>Who are you?</i>

42:14.033 --> 42:15.701
Who am I?

42:16.869 --> 42:19.872
- I am-
- <i>You're nobody.</i>

42:22.791 --> 42:24.293
Nobody?

42:25.628 --> 42:27.213
But I-

42:52.321 --> 42:54.323
Francesca, where on earth are you?

42:54.740 --> 42:56.992
I've been looking for you for an hour.

43:05.668 --> 43:08.462
- Are you sad, sir?
- No.

43:08.754 --> 43:11.131
Sir feels strange.

43:11.465 --> 43:14.260
I don't like. I prefer Sir be sad.

43:14.677 --> 43:18.806
- Are you going to bed?
- Last night I went to bed at 10:30.

43:19.473 --> 43:21.517
Now I don't know what to do.

43:21.809 --> 43:24.853
Morning is an unknown quantity to me.

43:25.020 --> 43:26.188
Unknown.

43:26.355 --> 43:29.608
Then Sir can help me clean the house.

43:29.984 --> 43:33.946
- Sir can't. Sir feels strange.
- Sir is a rascal.

43:34.071 --> 43:38.033
"Is there a new nation
stirring within the city walls?

43:38.534 --> 43:42.371
From the crevices of that soil
a feverish vapor ascends like smoke

43:42.579 --> 43:46.750
and works like a magic philter
in the blood of certain men,

43:47.209 --> 43:50.629
producing a form of heroic madness

43:50.754 --> 43:53.132
unlike any other."

43:56.552 --> 43:59.972
What do you think?
Friggin' powerful, right?

44:00.347 --> 44:04.310
Why the hell adapt D'Annunzio for the stage?

44:04.435 --> 44:06.729
D'Annunzio's always been paradigmatic-

44:06.895 --> 44:11.150
You think these intellectual acrobatics
lend you dignity,

44:11.275 --> 44:14.361
that others are better than you,
but you're wrong.

44:14.486 --> 44:18.574
Try and write something truly your own...

44:19.283 --> 44:21.327
about a feeling, or sorrow.

44:21.452 --> 44:24.204
You know, you've never been to my place.

44:24.330 --> 44:27.708
Your "place"?
You have a room in student housing.

44:27.833 --> 44:31.253
You going out with that sourpuss
you're always with?

44:31.378 --> 44:34.340
I wish. I've tried 7,000 times

44:34.465 --> 44:36.258
and never got a single kiss.

44:36.383 --> 44:39.595
- She's a bitch.
- No, she's not.

44:41.013 --> 44:42.639
She's complicated.

44:42.765 --> 44:45.100
She's a bitch.
Trust me. You're too kind.

44:45.309 --> 44:49.063
I can tell her type a mile off.
No need to even meet them.

44:49.188 --> 44:52.274
- What are you doing?
- My morning exercise.

44:52.399 --> 44:54.943
- That's exercise?
- Yes.

44:55.152 --> 44:57.821
Have you ever counted
the women you've been with?

44:57.946 --> 44:59.907
No, I'm terrible at math.

45:00.032 --> 45:02.785
I've always been great at math.

45:02.910 --> 45:06.830
But I know you've had six.
I introduced you to all of them.

45:06.955 --> 45:08.791
Seven.

45:08.916 --> 45:10.626
Seven?

45:11.043 --> 45:13.670
- When was number seven?
- Last summer.

45:13.796 --> 45:16.965
A friend of my sister's,
when I visited back home.

45:17.466 --> 45:20.135
She has a men's shop.

45:21.261 --> 45:22.471
She's nice.

45:22.596 --> 45:24.431
That means she's a dog.

45:24.640 --> 45:26.642
What about you and Orietta?

45:27.476 --> 45:29.478
- Who's Orietta?
- Who's Orietta?

45:29.645 --> 45:31.688
She was at your place the other night.

45:31.897 --> 45:33.148
A real beauty.

45:33.273 --> 45:36.110
At my age, a beautiful woman isn't enough.

45:50.499 --> 45:52.668
I might start writing again.

45:53.794 --> 45:56.171
That's great news!

45:57.005 --> 45:58.674
Did something happen?

46:03.679 --> 46:04.763
Why?

46:04.888 --> 46:07.850
If you want to write again
after all these years,

46:08.016 --> 46:10.018
something happened.

46:12.479 --> 46:15.691
Somethings always happening in Rome.
Nothing happened.

46:21.071 --> 46:22.990
What are you looking at?

46:24.199 --> 46:26.410
Come here.

46:33.667 --> 46:37.296
They met at the university ten days ago.

46:37.713 --> 46:39.673
They've been kissing

46:39.798 --> 46:42.134
nonstop for ten days.

46:51.727 --> 46:54.354
<i>This generation of young people horrifies me.</i>

46:54.480 --> 46:56.315
The state supports them for years,

46:56.440 --> 47:00.235
but when they realize they have half a brain,
they're off to study or work

47:00.360 --> 47:02.362
in America or London.

47:02.488 --> 47:04.823
They have no civic vocation.

47:04.948 --> 47:08.285
As a young girl, in the occupied Arts Department,
I oozed civic vocation.

47:08.410 --> 47:11.205
- You oozed civic vocation?
- Yes, why?

47:11.330 --> 47:13.916
- Come off it.
- What do you know?

47:14.041 --> 47:17.252
You were loafing around Naples
with rich girls

47:17.419 --> 47:19.379
and writing your only novelette.

47:19.505 --> 47:21.340
I didn't realize history was being made.

47:21.465 --> 47:23.217
Novelette?

47:23.342 --> 47:26.386
It was a masterpiece of Italian literature.

47:26.512 --> 47:29.765
Jep and civic vocation never got along.

47:29.932 --> 47:31.934
He was lazy, civic vocation was hyperactive.

47:32.100 --> 47:36.438
Romano, stop sucking up to your idol.
You're pathetic.

47:36.563 --> 47:38.774
<i>The Human Apparatus</i> was narrow-minded,

47:38.899 --> 47:42.444
frivolous, and as pretentious
as its title, and Jep knows it.

47:42.569 --> 47:45.072
That's why he stopped there.

47:45.197 --> 47:47.032
Sorry, and what about you?

47:47.157 --> 47:49.284
I tried changing things through literature.

47:49.409 --> 47:51.954
I wrote 11 socially engaged novels

47:52.079 --> 47:54.665
and a book on the official history of the Party.

47:54.790 --> 47:57.167
Don't forget your contribution
to that reality show-

47:57.292 --> 47:59.753
<i>Girl Farm.</i>

47:59.878 --> 48:02.589
Television can be a very formative experience.

48:02.714 --> 48:04.925
And when I'm invited somewhere, I go.

48:05.050 --> 48:08.262
I get my hands dirty.
I try things.

48:08.387 --> 48:10.430
I don't spend my life being a snob.

48:10.556 --> 48:14.142
Are you saying a socially engaged writer

48:14.268 --> 48:17.646
gets some sort of free pass
compared to a novelist

48:17.771 --> 48:20.482
who deals with- I don't know- feelings?

48:20.607 --> 48:22.526
Of course she is!

48:22.776 --> 48:25.737
The cause someone commits their life to
isn't secondary.

48:25.946 --> 48:27.948
Like having a family,

48:28.115 --> 48:32.869
sacrificing oneself day in and day out
to raise one's children.

48:32.995 --> 48:36.957
Eusebio and I have four children.
We plan the future together.

48:37.082 --> 48:39.585
I break my back to be
both mother and woman,

48:39.710 --> 48:44.673
and at the end of the day I feel
I've done something important.

48:44.798 --> 48:47.134
So those of us without children

48:47.259 --> 48:49.303
should consider suicide?

48:49.428 --> 48:52.347
- I don't mean you, of course.
- She means me.

48:53.140 --> 48:56.852
Dadina, I admire you greatly.
You're a real badass.

48:56.977 --> 48:59.730
Do you use "badass" in your novels?

48:59.855 --> 49:01.273
Yes, I do.

49:01.398 --> 49:03.400
I try to be modern.

49:03.525 --> 49:05.485
- Modernity is badass.
- <i>De gustibus...</i>

49:05.611 --> 49:07.529
Such conviction!

49:07.696 --> 49:11.742
I don't know whether to feel
jealous or appalled.

49:11.867 --> 49:14.369
Yes, I have convictions. I'm 53-

49:14.494 --> 49:16.622
- You'd never know it.
- Never.

49:16.747 --> 49:19.541
I'm 53. I've suffered,
but I've bounced back

49:19.666 --> 49:21.668
and learned a lot about life.

49:23.920 --> 49:26.465
At last- no further response.

49:26.632 --> 49:28.967
I was drinking.

49:29.092 --> 49:31.136
No response because we're fond of you

49:31.261 --> 49:33.388
and don't want to embarrass you,

49:33.513 --> 49:35.641
but all this boasting,

49:35.766 --> 49:40.187
all this earnest showing off,
all this "me, me, me"...

49:40.312 --> 49:42.731
and all these sweeping condemnations

49:42.856 --> 49:45.400
hide a certain fragility and unease

49:45.567 --> 49:48.111
and above all a whole series of untruths.

49:48.236 --> 49:51.698
We care about you,
and we know our own untruths,

49:51.823 --> 49:54.534
and that's why, unlike you,

49:54.660 --> 49:56.995
we end up talking about inane nonsense,

49:57.120 --> 50:00.582
because we have no intention
of facing our own pettiness.

50:00.749 --> 50:02.584
What untruths?

50:02.709 --> 50:06.004
Everything I said is true.
It's what I am, what I believe in.

50:06.129 --> 50:10.258
Please, I consider myself a gentleman.
Don't take away that only certainty.

50:10.425 --> 50:15.597
No, my friend. I want to hear it all:
What fragility? What untruths?

50:15.722 --> 50:18.266
I'm a woman with balls.
Out with it.

50:19.601 --> 50:23.397
"A woman with balls"
would be too much for any gentleman.

50:23.522 --> 50:26.775
Very well. You asked for it.
In random order:

50:27.609 --> 50:31.279
No one remembers your "civic vocation"
during your student days,

50:31.446 --> 50:35.617
whereas many recall another vocation of yours,

50:35.742 --> 50:40.038
one that took place
in the university restrooms.

50:40.163 --> 50:44.418
You wrote about the Party
because you were its leader's mistress.

50:44.543 --> 50:46.378
And your 11 novels,

50:46.503 --> 50:50.132
brought out by a small publisher
subsidized by the Party

50:50.424 --> 50:53.552
and reviewed by minor,
Party-affiliated newspapers,

50:54.094 --> 50:56.722
are insignificant. Everyone says so.

50:56.847 --> 51:00.267
I'm not saying my novelette was any better.

51:00.392 --> 51:02.644
I agree with you there.

51:02.769 --> 51:05.605
As for your relationship with Eusebio-

51:06.189 --> 51:09.484
what relationship?
Eusebio loves Giordano.

51:09.609 --> 51:12.612
Everyone knows that.
He has for years.

51:12.738 --> 51:16.074
They eat together every day at Arnaldo's,
next to the coat rack,

51:16.199 --> 51:20.162
like sweethearts under an oak tree.
But you and Eusebio keep pretending.

51:20.662 --> 51:25.250
As for your dedication to your children
and all the sacrifices entailed...

51:26.001 --> 51:29.629
you work all week in TV, you go out every night,
including Mondays,

51:29.755 --> 51:32.591
when even popper dealers don't venture out.

51:32.758 --> 51:35.427
You're never with your children,

51:35.552 --> 51:38.388
even on your long vacations.

51:38.513 --> 51:41.475
Plus you have a butler, a waiter...

51:42.184 --> 51:43.477
a cook...

51:43.602 --> 51:46.521
a chauffeur who drives the kids to school...

51:46.688 --> 51:48.356
and three babysitters.

51:48.482 --> 51:53.028
So how and when exactly
do you make any sacrifices?

51:53.820 --> 51:56.990
These are the untruths
and the fragility I mean.

51:59.117 --> 52:02.037
Stefa', mother and woman.

52:02.204 --> 52:05.081
You're 53, with a life in tatters,

52:05.207 --> 52:07.209
like the rest of us.

52:08.084 --> 52:11.880
So instead of lecturing us
and treating us with contempt,

52:12.088 --> 52:15.091
you should look at us with affection.

52:15.967 --> 52:18.678
We're all on the brink of despair.

52:18.804 --> 52:22.933
We can only look each other in the face,
keep each other company,

52:23.058 --> 52:24.893
kid each other a bit.

52:25.060 --> 52:26.561
Don't you agree?

55:12.394 --> 55:14.604
Son of a bitch!

55:15.730 --> 55:17.107
Egidio!

55:17.232 --> 55:20.610
You bastard!
I haven't seen you in 30 years!

55:33.373 --> 55:37.210
- I gotta talk to you.
- Later. Can't you see I'm busy?

55:37.335 --> 55:41.423
- Is this still your place?
- No, thank God, but I still manage it.

55:41.548 --> 55:45.969
You made it big!
You're always in the gossip rags.

55:46.094 --> 55:49.264
All the VIP parties.
A different girl every night.

55:49.389 --> 55:51.099
But you never come here.

55:51.266 --> 55:53.935
Get lost, will you?
We're having a serious talk.

55:54.728 --> 55:57.147
- Are you married?
- Married, divorced.

55:57.355 --> 56:01.067
- I've got a daughter, Ramona.
- Did you have to call her Ramona?

56:01.192 --> 56:03.403
You artists are all the same.

56:03.570 --> 56:06.781
I tell you I have a daughter,
and you moan about her name.

56:06.948 --> 56:08.783
What's wrong with "Ramona"?

56:08.950 --> 56:11.995
Nothing. It just sounds a bit pretentious.

56:12.120 --> 56:14.080
There she is now.

56:26.593 --> 56:29.345
She makes me so mad.
I've told her a million times.

56:29.471 --> 56:32.307
"You're too old for this."

56:32.432 --> 56:35.101
These hot young Polish girls
rule the scene now.

56:35.226 --> 56:37.687
They're experts at turning tricks.

56:37.896 --> 56:40.940
She's 42 and she wants to be
a sophisticated stripper.

56:41.066 --> 56:44.069
But the world's no longer sophisticated.
Right, Jep?

56:44.194 --> 56:46.488
Right. Only you and I are.

56:46.654 --> 56:48.740
That's right, goddamn it!

56:48.865 --> 56:52.285
But she wants to keep
doing this for the money.

56:52.410 --> 56:55.622
I don't know why she needs it,
what she does with it.

56:55.747 --> 56:59.667
- Drugs?
- I wish. We'd have a common interest.

56:59.793 --> 57:01.669
No, she doesn't even drink beer.

57:01.878 --> 57:03.880
I don't know what she spends it on.

57:04.005 --> 57:06.633
She's always broke.
Do I sound like a loser?

57:06.758 --> 57:08.259
No, why?

57:08.384 --> 57:12.097
I can hear myself talk.
I sound like a loser.

57:12.222 --> 57:16.059
I'm nearly 70 and I have to work
till 6:00 a.m. every day.

57:16.267 --> 57:19.854
I swapped cocaine for heroin 15 years ago.

57:20.021 --> 57:23.358
What an asshole!
A heroin junkie at 50!

57:23.525 --> 57:25.527
Could I be more of a loser?

57:25.819 --> 57:27.362
But I don't matter.

57:27.487 --> 57:30.698
It's her I worry about.
I love her.

57:30.824 --> 57:33.159
And I'm no loser there.
I'm a father.

57:33.284 --> 57:35.495
And like all fathers, I'm worried.

57:35.620 --> 57:37.372
What'll she do in a few years?

57:37.497 --> 57:39.707
She can't be a stripper at 50!

57:42.502 --> 57:44.712
- Why don't you fix her up?
- Me?

57:44.838 --> 57:47.048
Don't you have any rich friends

57:47.215 --> 57:49.509
looking for a beautiful wife?

57:49.634 --> 57:52.762
We could change her name.
That's no problem.

57:52.887 --> 57:55.265
You'd be doing me a big favor.

57:55.390 --> 57:58.810
- I'm a writer, not a pimp.
- Sorry, that was kinda crass.

57:58.935 --> 58:00.478
Daddy's little girl!

58:00.603 --> 58:03.273
This is my good friend, Jep Gambardella.

58:03.439 --> 58:06.693
You two get acquainted.
I need to use the bathroom.

58:06.818 --> 58:08.486
I'll be right back.

58:09.279 --> 58:11.656
- It's a pleasure. I'm Jep.
- Ramona.

58:26.004 --> 58:28.006
If you want a girl, get a Pole.

58:28.256 --> 58:30.133
Are you kidding?

58:31.092 --> 58:33.970
Who said anything about a girl? Not me.

58:34.429 --> 58:37.140
I really am an old friend of your father's.

58:37.432 --> 58:39.434
- Dad has no friends.
- He used to.

58:39.559 --> 58:43.646
When I came to Rome,
I'd wait for my friends to leave to come here.

58:43.771 --> 58:46.441
Your father's a nice guy.
He taught me a lot.

58:46.566 --> 58:48.776
For example, that vodka is uncouth.

58:49.611 --> 58:52.113
Dad knows a lot of useless stuff.

58:53.198 --> 58:55.241
He asked me to find you a husband.

58:55.366 --> 58:59.746
It's an obsession with him,
but I'm not looking for a husband.

58:59.871 --> 59:01.456
You should.

59:01.623 --> 59:04.626
- Family's a beautiful thing.
- That's true.

59:04.792 --> 59:07.629
But I'm not out out for beautiful things.

59:22.977 --> 59:24.812
What's wrong?

59:25.647 --> 59:27.315
I feel old.

59:27.690 --> 59:29.484
You're no spring chicken.

59:46.084 --> 59:47.752
Madame Ardant.

01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:18.760
One.

01:01:22.638 --> 01:01:24.849
- How are you?
- Very well.

01:01:25.058 --> 01:01:28.019
Just back from India.
I had the most amazing dysentery.

01:01:28.686 --> 01:01:31.981
Come to my divorce party.
There'll be burlesque dancers on elephants.

01:01:32.106 --> 01:01:35.151
Sure. What would you like for a present?

01:01:35.276 --> 01:01:38.446
Just one great wish:
an end to war in the Middle East.

01:01:38.571 --> 01:01:40.406
- I'll do my best.
- Two.

01:01:40.531 --> 01:01:42.116
Seven hundred euros.

01:01:43.785 --> 01:01:45.286
Tell me, darling.

01:01:45.703 --> 01:01:49.957
I was thinking perhaps my mouth.

01:01:50.666 --> 01:01:53.920
I'm soared.
I've never clone this before, Professor.

01:01:54.045 --> 01:01:55.880
Don't call me "professor."

01:01:56.005 --> 01:01:58.800
Call me "my friend" or "my love."

01:01:58.925 --> 01:02:01.511
We all need love.

01:02:01.636 --> 01:02:04.680
What sign are you, deeply intense lady?

01:02:04.806 --> 01:02:06.724
- Aquarius.
- I knew it.

01:02:06.849 --> 01:02:10.561
Want to go back 30 years,
to when it always rained in late August?

01:02:11.187 --> 01:02:13.314
- Done.
- That's 700.

01:02:13.815 --> 01:02:14.982
Three.

01:02:19.654 --> 01:02:24.492
- You've been to see Casagrande.
- No, I don't even know him.

01:02:24.617 --> 01:02:26.160
You've betrayed me, darling.

01:02:26.327 --> 01:02:28.621
We're on a journey together here,

01:02:28.746 --> 01:02:31.165
and you've interrupted it.

01:02:31.374 --> 01:02:33.501
This is the last time.

01:02:37.755 --> 01:02:39.257
Go on.

01:02:39.424 --> 01:02:41.008
Bye then.

01:02:41.509 --> 01:02:43.553
- Full price.
- Five.

01:02:43.678 --> 01:02:45.012
1,200 euros.

01:02:46.013 --> 01:02:48.641
- How's your mom?
- Fine, thanks.

01:02:48.766 --> 01:02:50.810
- Seven.
- That's 700.

01:02:50.935 --> 01:02:52.311
You look a bit swollen.

01:02:52.437 --> 01:02:53.980
You're always in my heart.

01:02:54.105 --> 01:02:55.440
Seven hundred.

01:02:55.565 --> 01:02:58.317
- As handsome as ever.
- Ten.

01:02:58.443 --> 01:03:00.361
- You're my pride and joy.
- Thanks.

01:03:01.446 --> 01:03:03.030
Eleven.

01:03:07.785 --> 01:03:11.539
Professor, I'm here about my hyperhidrosis.

01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:14.041
Where does this undesired perspiration happen?

01:03:14.542 --> 01:03:16.377
On my hands.

01:03:20.673 --> 01:03:24.093
- Pray for me, Sister.
- You don't need my prayers.

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:26.804
You don't know how much of my income

01:03:26.929 --> 01:03:28.931
goes to the tax man.

01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:31.058
Go on, Sister.

01:03:40.193 --> 01:03:41.903
That's 700, Sister.

01:03:43.488 --> 01:03:44.822
Fourteen.

01:04:04.008 --> 01:04:06.552
- You spying on me?
- No, I was going to knock.

01:04:07.053 --> 01:04:09.430
- When?
- When you were more relaxed.

01:04:23.444 --> 01:04:27.073
- What brings you here?
- Nothing. Simple curiosity.

01:04:28.491 --> 01:04:31.869
- I told you what I think.
- I have no hidden agenda.

01:04:32.036 --> 01:04:36.290
You think every guy
who comes near you wants sex?

01:04:36.832 --> 01:04:39.460
Couldn't they just want to talk,

01:04:39.585 --> 01:04:43.047
driven by a simple and harmless curiosity?

01:04:43.172 --> 01:04:45.466
- That's never happened before.
- It has now.

01:04:47.468 --> 01:04:49.804
Wouldn't armbands be more comfortable?

01:04:49.971 --> 01:04:52.515
Sure, but they irritate my armpits.

01:04:54.725 --> 01:04:56.936
You have plans for lunch?

01:04:57.061 --> 01:04:59.188
I'm going to my mom's with my dad.

01:04:59.313 --> 01:05:01.399
Where's the dog?

01:05:02.316 --> 01:05:03.693
What dog?

01:05:03.818 --> 01:05:07.154
People buy houses like this
so they can have dogs.

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:09.282
I had a Labrador,

01:05:09.407 --> 01:05:12.243
but nine years ago
he got fed up and left.

01:05:12.368 --> 01:05:14.328
Labradors are dumb.

01:05:14.996 --> 01:05:17.582
So are cooker spaniels.

01:05:24.922 --> 01:05:26.632
Hi, Jep.

01:05:27.383 --> 01:05:29.176
Hi, Antonello.

01:05:30.386 --> 01:05:33.180
- You know Venditti?
- I know everyone.

01:05:34.181 --> 01:05:36.976
It must be nice knowing so many people.

01:05:37.101 --> 01:05:38.978
It's a sure way to be unhappy.

01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:41.272
Have people let you down?

01:05:42.898 --> 01:05:44.984
I've let them down.

01:05:46.235 --> 01:05:48.237
Andrea. You here with your mom?

01:05:48.362 --> 01:05:50.364
- She's parking.
- How are you?

01:05:50.531 --> 01:05:51.991
Not well.

01:05:52.116 --> 01:05:55.244
Proust says that death
may come to us this afternoon.

01:05:55.453 --> 01:05:56.996
Proust is scary.

01:05:57.204 --> 01:06:00.875
Not tomorrow, not in a year,
but this very afternoon.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.628
It's already evening,
so it'd be tomorrow afternoon.

01:06:03.753 --> 01:06:07.298
And Turgenev said,
"Death cast his gaze my way."

01:06:07.423 --> 01:06:10.134
Don't take these writers so seriously.

01:06:10.259 --> 01:06:12.386
Who should I take seriously then?

01:06:12.511 --> 01:06:15.890
No one and nothing.
Except the menu, of course.

01:06:18.559 --> 01:06:22.730
Things are too complicated
for one individual to understand.

01:06:23.397 --> 01:06:27.234
Just because you don't understand
doesn't mean nobody can.

01:06:31.197 --> 01:06:33.741
- Your reply?
- What can I say?

01:06:34.617 --> 01:06:36.911
- Jep!
- Hello, Viola.

01:06:37.912 --> 01:06:40.206
- Good evening.
- Viola.

01:06:40.456 --> 01:06:43.584
Darling, why don't you get us a table?

01:06:47.171 --> 01:06:49.507
How did he seem to you?

01:06:50.049 --> 01:06:51.759
- He's better.
- Better.

01:06:52.218 --> 01:06:54.929
He's much better. I'm so happy.

01:06:55.096 --> 01:06:56.931
- Dinner on Thursday?
- Of course.

01:06:57.056 --> 01:06:59.600
Thursday I'm inexplicably free.

01:06:59.767 --> 01:07:01.811
Did you hear about Valentina Lemme?

01:07:01.936 --> 01:07:04.271
She's dating her personal trainer.

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:06.524
Really? It doesn't show.

01:07:07.274 --> 01:07:10.027
- I invited her anyway.
- Are you sure?

01:07:10.152 --> 01:07:13.114
That woman's evil, like the devil.

01:07:14.073 --> 01:07:15.908
Really? How can that be?

01:07:16.033 --> 01:07:19.537
I see her at yoga twice a week.

01:07:19.704 --> 01:07:22.081
- Anyway, you'll come?
- Of course.

01:07:22.248 --> 01:07:24.125
- See you Thursday.
- Okay.

01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:25.292
Good-bye.

01:07:29.088 --> 01:07:31.215
Keep your eye on that table,

01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:34.635
but don't let them catch you watching.

01:07:35.970 --> 01:07:37.471
Waiter?

01:07:37.596 --> 01:07:39.598
Champagne, please. Cristal.

01:07:39.724 --> 01:07:42.518
You can't imagine how much one learns

01:07:42.643 --> 01:07:46.439
living amid a cluster
of religious institutions.

01:08:01.245 --> 01:08:04.415
So that was your first time?

01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:07.168
Yes. He didn't think he'd been any good.

01:08:07.293 --> 01:08:09.295
Too quick, he said.

01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:12.882
So out of anger or to let off steam-
I'm not sure which-

01:08:13.007 --> 01:08:16.218
he played with a soccer ball
like a madman for an hour.

01:08:16.343 --> 01:08:17.845
What did you do?

01:08:18.179 --> 01:08:20.765
I didn't enjoy making love with him,

01:08:20.890 --> 01:08:25.853
but watching him show off like that
was unforgettable.

01:08:26.854 --> 01:08:30.399
He got really good.
He played on the national team.

01:08:34.904 --> 01:08:38.323
Your dad said you spend everything you earn.
What on?

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:40.201
You can tell me.

01:08:41.702 --> 01:08:43.953
Maybe one day I'll tell you.

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:46.749
But why didn't you ever write another book?

01:08:46.874 --> 01:08:49.376
Because I went out too much at night.

01:08:50.544 --> 01:08:53.046
Rome can really waste your time.

01:08:53.214 --> 01:08:57.718
It's distracting.
Writing takes focus and quiet.

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:00.679
That's not much of an answer.

01:09:00.805 --> 01:09:03.849
You have peace and quiet here.
It's like being in the country.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.894
I wrote in short spurts...

01:09:07.019 --> 01:09:09.063
sprinter-style.

01:09:14.568 --> 01:09:16.612
I told you about my first time...

01:09:17.238 --> 01:09:20.198
but you've told me nothing.
It's your turn now.

01:09:29.416 --> 01:09:32.586
On an island one summer.

01:09:33.045 --> 01:09:37.424
I was 18. She was 20.

01:09:39.426 --> 01:09:41.511
<i>At the lighthouse, at night.</i>

01:09:44.265 --> 01:09:47.350
<i>I went to kiss her.
She turned her face away.</i>

01:09:49.270 --> 01:09:51.272
I was disappointed.

01:09:53.064 --> 01:09:55.818
But then she turned to look at me.

01:09:56.610 --> 01:09:59.029
She brushed my lips.

01:09:59.363 --> 01:10:01.115
She smelled of flowers.

01:10:03.033 --> 01:10:04.869
I didn't move.

01:10:04.994 --> 01:10:07.454
I couldn't have moved.

01:10:11.625 --> 01:10:13.794
Then she took a step back

01:10:14.169 --> 01:10:15.963
and said-

01:10:22.303 --> 01:10:24.305
She stepped back...

01:10:28.392 --> 01:10:30.019
and said...

01:10:46.118 --> 01:10:48.162
I'm going home. It's late.

01:10:48.412 --> 01:10:51.206
Want to go to a party with me
tomorrow night?

01:11:40.172 --> 01:11:42.925
Outstanding!

01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:45.552
Were you trying to kill us all with anxiety?

01:11:45.719 --> 01:11:49.682
You may not believe this,
but I love knife throwers.

01:11:49.807 --> 01:11:51.976
A true likeness, especially the hips.

01:11:52.476 --> 01:11:56.730
A masterpiece, Geronimo.
It'll look great above the mantelpiece.

01:12:55.247 --> 01:12:57.458
God bless you, Jep!

01:12:57.666 --> 01:12:59.334
This is Ramona.

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:01.295
What a unique and marvelous creature.

01:13:02.004 --> 01:13:04.298
- Is he putting me on?
- Hard to say.

01:13:04.965 --> 01:13:06.467
I meant it.

01:13:06.633 --> 01:13:09.094
I'm just sorry you missed Geronimo D.

01:13:09.219 --> 01:13:11.305
We'll get over it.

01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:13.432
Make yourselves at home.

01:13:13.724 --> 01:13:16.060
- Who is that asshole?
- Lillo De Gregorio...

01:13:16.268 --> 01:13:19.438
the greatest modern art collector
in this country of degenerates.

01:13:19.730 --> 01:13:22.399
What's Jep's floozy friend wearing?

01:13:22.524 --> 01:13:24.234
I don't know.

01:13:24.610 --> 01:13:27.613
Jep's becoming a bit of a disappointment.

01:13:27.738 --> 01:13:31.241
- Good evening, Countess.
- Hello. You're looking well.

01:13:31.366 --> 01:13:33.869
I wish I could say the same for the count.

01:13:33.994 --> 01:13:35.496
Hello, ladies.

01:13:36.246 --> 01:13:38.999
Are you crazy?
You're distracting my artist.

01:13:39.124 --> 01:13:40.542
Dad, we're having fun.

01:13:40.667 --> 01:13:43.212
Carmelina, come do a little work.

01:13:43.337 --> 01:13:45.255
Morn, I want to play here.

01:13:45.506 --> 01:13:48.550
- Has this human being gone mad?
- We'll work this out.

01:13:48.675 --> 01:13:52.262
- I'm staying here.
- You realize what you're saying?

01:13:52.387 --> 01:13:54.723
Europe's greatest gallery owners are outside.

01:13:54.848 --> 01:13:58.560
If you show them what you can do,
ours will be a happy family.

01:13:58.685 --> 01:14:01.605
I'm happy now, and I want to be a vet.

01:14:01.855 --> 01:14:03.857
Off to bed, you two.

01:14:04.024 --> 01:14:06.819
See that? My kids are going to bed.

01:14:06.944 --> 01:14:08.028
Come on.

01:14:08.195 --> 01:14:10.697
Then I'll go to bed too.
I'm a kid too.

01:14:15.953 --> 01:14:19.540
<i>She blushes and says,
"Forgive me.</i>

01:14:19.665 --> 01:14:22.876
I didn't realize you loved me so much.

01:14:23.335 --> 01:14:26.421
My ignorance is obscene."

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:29.174
He looks at her reassuringly and says,

01:14:29.299 --> 01:14:32.678
"Let me plead for our love."

01:14:32.803 --> 01:14:35.722
How's that for the start
of the second act?

01:14:35.889 --> 01:14:37.933
It's a pile of shit.

01:17:35.736 --> 01:17:37.654
That little girl was crying.

01:17:37.779 --> 01:17:41.199
What are you talking about?
That little girl earns millions.

01:17:41.867 --> 01:17:43.702
Excuse me a moment.

01:17:46.747 --> 01:17:48.248
Hi, Stefano.

01:17:49.082 --> 01:17:50.250
Hi, Jep.

01:17:50.417 --> 01:17:53.545
- Caterings gone downhill.
- Rome's gone downhill.

01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:55.714
Straight downhill.

01:17:59.384 --> 01:18:01.470
Do you have your case with you?

01:18:04.431 --> 01:18:06.975
- Always.
- You up for it?

01:19:13.959 --> 01:19:15.335
See that?

01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:23.218
Stefano has the keys

01:19:23.343 --> 01:19:25.887
to the most beautiful buildings in Rome.

01:19:26.638 --> 01:19:29.141
- Is he a doorman?
- No.

01:19:29.683 --> 01:19:31.518
He's not a doorman.

01:19:32.686 --> 01:19:35.188
He's friends with princesses.

01:19:38.483 --> 01:19:40.026
Ready?

01:19:40.944 --> 01:19:42.446
Come with me.

01:21:47.195 --> 01:21:49.531
Good evening, Princesses.

01:21:49.739 --> 01:21:51.324
Good evening.

01:22:05.297 --> 01:22:07.340
How come you have all these keys?

01:22:09.175 --> 01:22:10.844
Because...

01:22:12.429 --> 01:22:14.431
I'm a trustworthy person.

01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:34.367
You see that? It looked huge,
but it's actually tiny.

01:22:36.161 --> 01:22:39.539
Stand still while I take your picture.

01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:45.712
That one was no good. Smile.

01:22:48.131 --> 01:22:49.591
You got it?

01:22:50.133 --> 01:22:52.218
Now I do.

01:23:45.939 --> 01:23:48.733
<i>Many people think that a funeral</i>

01:23:48.858 --> 01:23:52.404
<i>is a random event, with no rules.</i>

01:23:52.904 --> 01:23:54.781
<i>That isn't true.</i>

01:23:54.906 --> 01:23:59.119
<i>A funeral is the high-society event
par excellence.</i>

01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:03.957
<i>You must never forget that at a funeral...</i>

01:24:04.916 --> 01:24:07.127
you're appearing onstage.

01:24:11.548 --> 01:24:13.049
Nice.

01:24:13.842 --> 01:24:16.261
But I'd try the other one on too.

01:24:17.387 --> 01:24:19.305
You must wait patiently

01:24:19.431 --> 01:24:22.642
until family members
have freed themselves from the throng.

01:24:23.309 --> 01:24:28.314
Once you've made certain
your audience is seated,

01:24:28.523 --> 01:24:32.235
only at that point
may you offer your condolences.

01:24:32.986 --> 01:24:36.114
This way everyone will see you.

01:24:37.157 --> 01:24:39.659
You take the grieving relative's hands,

01:24:39.868 --> 01:24:43.663
or you place your hands on their arms.

01:24:43.997 --> 01:24:46.958
You whisper something in their ear,

01:24:47.083 --> 01:24:50.170
a comforting phrase uttered with authority.

01:24:50.336 --> 01:24:52.172
For example...

01:24:52.839 --> 01:24:54.799
"In the days to come,

01:24:55.425 --> 01:24:59.679
when a great emptiness comes over you,

01:25:00.013 --> 01:25:03.349
know that you can always count on me."

01:25:04.517 --> 01:25:06.519
The public will wonder...

01:25:08.146 --> 01:25:11.107
"What's Jep Gambardella saying?"

01:25:24.579 --> 01:25:26.498
This is definitely the right dress.

01:25:31.628 --> 01:25:34.047
You're allowed to retire

01:25:34.172 --> 01:25:36.674
to a corner by yourself,

01:25:37.008 --> 01:25:40.512
as if to contemplate your own grief.

01:25:41.679 --> 01:25:46.351
But here too great shrewdness is called for.

01:25:47.101 --> 01:25:51.564
The spot chosen must be isolated

01:25:51.689 --> 01:25:54.400
yet clearly visible to the public.

01:25:54.901 --> 01:25:59.155
Furthermore, a good performance

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:01.741
is devoid of all extraneous elements.

01:26:03.409 --> 01:26:05.411
Thus the fundamental rule:

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:10.083
<i>One must never cry at a funeral...</i>

01:26:10.708 --> 01:26:14.337
<i>for one must never upstage
the family's sorrow.</i>

01:26:14.462 --> 01:26:17.006
<i>That is forbidden...</i>

01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:22.262
<i>because it's immoral.</i>

01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:02.010
Viola.

01:27:10.602 --> 01:27:12.979
In the days to come,

01:27:13.104 --> 01:27:15.481
when a great emptiness comes over you...

01:27:16.816 --> 01:27:19.068
know that you can always count on me.

01:28:09.369 --> 01:28:14.874
I now ask Andrea's friends
to come forward...

01:28:16.834 --> 01:28:20.046
so that the coffin may be carried outside.

01:28:41.985 --> 01:28:43.319
Your back!

01:29:55.641 --> 01:29:57.852
It was nice not making love.

01:29:59.312 --> 01:30:01.689
It was nice loving each other.

01:30:02.607 --> 01:30:06.360
I'd really forgotten
what loving someone was about.

01:30:12.992 --> 01:30:15.787
I spend all my money on medical treatments.

01:30:24.796 --> 01:30:26.547
Your breakfast.

01:30:27.924 --> 01:30:31.344
Get up. I'm taking you to see
a sea monster today.

01:30:53.032 --> 01:30:54.575
Your breakfast.

01:30:56.953 --> 01:30:58.871
Five more minutes.

01:31:06.045 --> 01:31:08.047
You see the sea?

01:31:15.304 --> 01:31:16.889
Where?

01:31:17.223 --> 01:31:18.850
On the ceiling.

01:31:25.273 --> 01:31:27.316
Yes, I see it.

01:33:01.953 --> 01:33:04.664
Who'll look after you now?

01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:23.599
I'm sorry about your daughter.
My condolences.

01:33:50.459 --> 01:33:53.254
<i>I've spent all my summers</i>

01:33:53.796 --> 01:33:56.215
<i>making plans for September.</i>

01:33:56.549 --> 01:33:58.175
No longer.

01:33:59.677 --> 01:34:02.054
Now I spend the summer

01:34:02.179 --> 01:34:06.225
remembering plans I'd made that faded away

01:34:07.143 --> 01:34:09.186
due partly to laziness

01:34:09.312 --> 01:34:11.689
and partly to carelessness.

01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:17.361
What's wrong with feeling nostalgic?

01:34:19.071 --> 01:34:23.743
It's the only distraction left for those
who have no faith in the future.

01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:29.623
Without rain...

01:34:30.166 --> 01:34:32.168
August is coming to an end,

01:34:32.752 --> 01:34:34.879
and September isn't yet here.

01:34:36.130 --> 01:34:38.466
And I'm so ordinary.

01:34:39.258 --> 01:34:41.677
But there's no need to worry.

01:34:42.178 --> 01:34:44.972
It's all right. It's okay.

01:35:10.414 --> 01:35:11.957
Thank you.

01:35:56.836 --> 01:35:58.337
Jep!

01:35:59.422 --> 01:36:01.841
What are you doing here?

01:36:02.341 --> 01:36:03.801
Arturo.

01:36:04.218 --> 01:36:05.845
Why are you here?

01:36:06.053 --> 01:36:09.557
Can't you see?
I'm rehearsing my magic show.

01:36:09.723 --> 01:36:13.853
This is tomorrow's special number:
the disappearing giraffe.

01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:16.522
You can make that giraffe disappear?

01:36:16.814 --> 01:36:19.692
Of course I can.

01:36:21.735 --> 01:36:23.779
Then make me disappear too.

01:36:25.448 --> 01:36:27.199
Jep...

01:36:27.366 --> 01:36:31.454
if I could really make people disappear,

01:36:31.871 --> 01:36:36.208
you think I'd still be here at my age
playing these circus games?

01:36:36.876 --> 01:36:38.711
It's just a trick.

01:36:43.132 --> 01:36:44.842
It's just a trick.

01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:56.562
Romano, how did it go?

01:36:56.896 --> 01:36:59.023
It went well. They clapped.

01:36:59.148 --> 01:37:00.941
I'm glad.

01:37:01.442 --> 01:37:04.111
- Why do you look so sad?
- I'm not sad.

01:37:04.236 --> 01:37:06.238
What's with the giraffe?

01:37:06.405 --> 01:37:09.116
For a magic show.
I'll come see your show tomorrow.

01:37:09.241 --> 01:37:11.160
I'm not doing the show tomorrow.

01:37:12.119 --> 01:37:13.829
Why? You said it went well.

01:37:13.954 --> 01:37:15.915
I'm leaving.

01:37:16.081 --> 01:37:19.043
I'm going back to my home town for good.

01:37:19.585 --> 01:37:23.088
I'm not even stopping by my place.
I'm leaving it all.

01:37:25.132 --> 01:37:28.594
I've lived in this city for 40 years.

01:37:29.345 --> 01:37:31.764
And in the end I thought...

01:37:33.224 --> 01:37:36.018
the only person who deserved a good-bye

01:37:36.644 --> 01:37:38.521
was you.

01:37:40.481 --> 01:37:42.775
What do you mean, you're leaving?

01:37:44.944 --> 01:37:48.113
Roma'... why are you leaving?

01:37:48.531 --> 01:37:51.158
Rome has been a real disappointment.

01:37:56.789 --> 01:37:58.332
Bye, Jep-

01:38:18.727 --> 01:38:20.479
See?

01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:52.970
- Want some coffee?
- No, thanks. I won't take up your time.

01:38:53.095 --> 01:38:55.180
I came to ask you something.

01:38:55.514 --> 01:38:57.308
Go ahead.

01:39:01.395 --> 01:39:03.856
Why did Elisa leave me?

01:39:07.067 --> 01:39:08.694
I don't know.

01:39:08.861 --> 01:39:13.032
Didn't she say anything
about it in her diary?

01:39:13.490 --> 01:39:15.868
No, I don't think so.

01:39:19.204 --> 01:39:22.833
Would you be offended
if I asked to read it?

01:39:22.958 --> 01:39:25.878
No, I wouldn't be offended.

01:39:26.545 --> 01:39:28.714
In fact, I'd understand very well.

01:39:30.883 --> 01:39:34.219
- But I'm afraid I can't.
- Why not?

01:39:35.054 --> 01:39:38.057
I threw it away a few days after the funeral.

01:39:43.896 --> 01:39:46.148
May I introduce my girlfriend?

01:39:47.733 --> 01:39:50.235
Nice to meet you.
My name's Polina.

01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:55.574
Like Polina in Dostoyevsky's <i>The Gambler.</i>

01:40:01.914 --> 01:40:04.249
What will you two do tonight?

01:40:05.709 --> 01:40:07.169
Nothing.

01:40:08.337 --> 01:40:10.714
Polina's going to finish ironing.

01:40:11.256 --> 01:40:13.634
Then we'll have a glass of red wine,

01:40:14.301 --> 01:40:16.470
watch a little TV,

01:40:16.595 --> 01:40:18.555
and go to bed.

01:40:19.014 --> 01:40:20.432
What about you?

01:40:21.850 --> 01:40:24.186
I'll have quite a few drinks,

01:40:24.311 --> 01:40:27.314
but not enough to become a nuisance.

01:40:27.648 --> 01:40:29.191
And then...

01:40:30.818 --> 01:40:33.028
when you two are getting up,

01:40:33.612 --> 01:40:35.698
I'll be going to bed.

01:40:42.287 --> 01:40:45.541
What lovely people you are!

01:40:56.135 --> 01:40:58.637
I love conga lines!

01:41:02.349 --> 01:41:03.475
I'll fuck you!

01:41:07.146 --> 01:41:09.148
"Who am I?"

01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:14.111
That's how one of Breton's novels began.

01:41:14.987 --> 01:41:17.990
And of course in the book
there's no reply.

01:41:18.574 --> 01:41:21.368
- Did you hear about Viola?
- What?

01:41:21.618 --> 01:41:24.538
She's donating everything to the church.

01:41:24.663 --> 01:41:28.792
She helps out at the parish
and is going to volunteer in Africa.

01:41:29.209 --> 01:41:31.712
The conga lines at our parties

01:41:31.837 --> 01:41:34.006
are the best in Rome.

01:41:34.882 --> 01:41:37.342
- The best?
- That's right.

01:41:38.761 --> 01:41:41.972
Because they don't go anywhere.

01:41:53.442 --> 01:41:55.903
- How is it?
- Really great, Jep.

01:41:56.028 --> 01:41:58.238
Come on, it's all gone.

01:41:58.447 --> 01:42:00.657
<i>Why did you leave me?</i>

01:42:00.783 --> 01:42:05.120
Please, I want an explanation.

01:42:05.704 --> 01:42:09.082
Go away! Get out!

01:42:34.608 --> 01:42:36.652
You see all these people?

01:42:37.820 --> 01:42:39.655
They can't do anything.

01:42:40.405 --> 01:42:42.950
But there's something I do well.

01:42:43.617 --> 01:42:46.036
Something we do well.

01:42:48.413 --> 01:42:50.082
How sweet!

01:43:34.209 --> 01:43:37.087
<i>For years people have been asking
why I don't write</i>

01:43:37.212 --> 01:43:38.755
<i>another novel.</i>

01:43:39.798 --> 01:43:41.967
<i>But look at these people.</i>

01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:44.720
This Wildlife.

01:43:45.804 --> 01:43:47.222
This is my life...

01:43:47.514 --> 01:43:49.474
and it's nothing.

01:43:52.144 --> 01:43:55.898
Flaubert wanted to write a book
about nothing but failed,

01:43:56.023 --> 01:43:58.150
so how am I supposed to?

01:44:04.990 --> 01:44:07.451
It's good. Thanks, rascal.

01:44:22.132 --> 01:44:24.259
What inspired this exhibit?

01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:28.347
Honestly, the idea wasn't mine.

01:44:28.513 --> 01:44:31.016
My father came up with it.

01:44:31.475 --> 01:44:35.145
When I was born, he started
taking pictures of me every day.

01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:37.230
One picture per day.

01:44:37.648 --> 01:44:40.275
He never forgot, not even once.

01:44:40.776 --> 01:44:44.571
From the age of 14 on,
I kept it up.

01:44:45.364 --> 01:44:48.659
I took pictures of myself every day.

01:44:53.163 --> 01:44:54.665
Have a look.

01:46:38.310 --> 01:46:41.021
- Cardinal.
- Your Eminence.

01:46:44.274 --> 01:46:47.027
Cardinal, when will the saint arrive in Rome?

01:46:47.152 --> 01:46:50.655
On Thursday, but please
don't call her the saint.

01:46:50.781 --> 01:46:52.657
She is a saint,

01:46:52.824 --> 01:46:54.826
but not technically.

01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:58.663
Tell me something:
Who's that cardinal?

01:46:58.789 --> 01:47:00.957
- That's Bellucci.
- Bellucci?

01:47:01.249 --> 01:47:03.251
- The one in line to be-
- Exactly.

01:47:03.376 --> 01:47:05.462
The papal throne awaits him.

01:47:05.587 --> 01:47:08.131
I met him at Giada Ricci's carnival party.

01:47:08.256 --> 01:47:11.676
It's said that as a young man
he was Europe's best exorcist.

01:47:11.843 --> 01:47:13.678
- You pulling my leg?
- No.

01:47:14.262 --> 01:47:16.264
I never joke about the devil.

01:47:16.765 --> 01:47:20.018
I am very, very bored.

01:47:21.478 --> 01:47:24.481
We're having a very, very good time.

01:47:24.981 --> 01:47:27.025
<i>You cut up the duck</i>

01:47:27.234 --> 01:47:32.197
and brown it over a high flame
for 15 minutes.

01:47:32.531 --> 01:47:33.990
At that point-

01:47:34.157 --> 01:47:37.035
Cardinal, do you remember me?
Lello Cava.

01:47:37.202 --> 01:47:39.746
We met at Giada Ricci's party.

01:47:39.913 --> 01:47:41.873
I was dressed as a hooker.

01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:44.876
Come, everyone. They're serving lunch.

01:47:45.001 --> 01:47:48.004
I'd like you meet my writer friend,

01:47:48.130 --> 01:47:50.799
- Jep Gambardella.
- A writer!

01:47:51.591 --> 01:47:53.844
This country needs writers.

01:47:54.010 --> 01:47:56.179
Actually I thought it needed priests more.

01:47:56.304 --> 01:47:57.305
Help...

01:47:57.430 --> 01:48:00.684
- May I ask you a question?
- Of course, my dear man.

01:48:00.809 --> 01:48:03.228
For some time now...

01:48:09.484 --> 01:48:12.320
from a spiritual point of view-

01:48:13.738 --> 01:48:18.243
- Shall we see the skunks later?
- Absolutely! I'll lead the way!

01:48:18.368 --> 01:48:21.329
I know the grounds well.

01:48:27.544 --> 01:48:32.007
Jep Gambardella, king of socialites,
you're losing it.

01:48:32.132 --> 01:48:36.428
I've been losing it for 40 years.
It's a steady decline.

01:48:41.683 --> 01:48:43.768
Tell me something, Stefa'.

01:48:43.977 --> 01:48:47.397
Have we ever slept together?

01:48:48.356 --> 01:48:50.150
Of course not.

01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:57.532
That's a crying shame.

01:48:57.657 --> 01:48:59.868
We have to rectify that.

01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:02.204
Idiot!

01:49:05.373 --> 01:49:07.083
Thank goodness.

01:49:08.585 --> 01:49:11.796
There's something wonderful
left for us to enjoy together.

01:49:14.841 --> 01:49:17.636
The future is a marvelous thing, Stefa'.

01:49:53.713 --> 01:49:59.010
To be honest, Catellani hasn't had
much worsted fabric in recent years.

01:49:59.219 --> 01:50:03.515
In my opinion,
Rebecchi's still the best tailor in Rome.

01:50:06.184 --> 01:50:09.229
- Who are you?
- A hard-working man

01:50:09.437 --> 01:50:12.148
who, while you play the artist,

01:50:12.274 --> 01:50:14.943
and have fun with your friends,

01:50:15.068 --> 01:50:16.861
keeps this country going.

01:50:17.028 --> 01:50:19.698
I keep this country going,

01:50:19.864 --> 01:50:22.450
but many people don't yet understand that.

01:50:25.370 --> 01:50:27.539
<i>Imagine that, Dadina.</i>

01:50:27.664 --> 01:50:31.376
<i>My neighbor was Giulio Moneta,
one of the world's</i>

01:50:31.501 --> 01:50:33.211
10 most-wanted men,

01:50:33.670 --> 01:50:35.880
and I never realized it.

01:50:36.047 --> 01:50:38.883
You've changed. You're always thinking.

01:50:41.511 --> 01:50:43.513
Maybe I should do what Romano did.

01:50:44.431 --> 01:50:47.100
I'm not fit for this life
or this city anymore.

01:50:47.267 --> 01:50:51.730
No one's fit for shit, Jep.
Take it from the queen of misfits.

01:50:53.064 --> 01:50:55.817
Everything around me is dying.

01:50:56.735 --> 01:50:59.904
People who are younger than me, things.

01:51:00.655 --> 01:51:02.240
Right before my eyes, and I-

01:51:02.365 --> 01:51:05.910
And you're suffering,
and you don't understand.

01:51:13.543 --> 01:51:15.587
How's the soup, Jeppino?

01:51:19.007 --> 01:51:20.717
The soup's good.

01:51:23.219 --> 01:51:27.223
Why did you call me Jeppino?
No one's called me that in ages.

01:51:27.390 --> 01:51:29.434
Because every now and then,

01:51:29.559 --> 01:51:33.605
a friend should help a friend
feel like he did as a child.

01:51:35.565 --> 01:51:38.234
How can I make you feel
like a little girl?

01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:41.446
No need for that.
I feel like that every day.

01:51:41.571 --> 01:51:45.116
I've been blessed to see the world
from that perspective for 60 years.

01:51:46.159 --> 01:51:48.787
You know of Sister Maria,
the African missionary,

01:51:48.953 --> 01:51:50.955
the one they call the saint?

01:51:51.081 --> 01:51:55.001
Sure, she's coming to Rome
to receive some honor.

01:51:55.168 --> 01:51:58.588
Exactly. She's only granted three interviews
in all her life.

01:51:58.755 --> 01:52:03.093
- Yours will be memorable.
- Look how I did with Giulio Moneta!

01:52:03.218 --> 01:52:04.803
This is different.

01:52:04.928 --> 01:52:07.806
She studied in Italy as a girl
and speaks Italian.

01:52:07.972 --> 01:52:10.475
She read your novel back then and loved it.

01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:14.145
She wants to meet you.
I organized a dinner at your house tomorrow.

01:52:14.562 --> 01:52:17.440
- Did I do well?
- Very well.

01:54:20.647 --> 01:54:24.609
Tomorrow I'll have the honor
of dining with her.

01:54:24.734 --> 01:54:27.153
- At the Holy Father's?
- No.

01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:29.113
At Jep Gambardella's.

01:54:29.948 --> 01:54:32.909
You see? The pope even had

01:54:33.201 --> 01:54:35.787
the cloistered nuns come.

01:55:11.614 --> 01:55:13.658
Sisters, sisters, sisters!

01:55:14.617 --> 01:55:16.619
Sisters, sisters. Perfect.

01:55:18.746 --> 01:55:19.872
The Red Cross nurses!

01:55:19.998 --> 01:55:22.166
What robust women!

01:55:23.293 --> 01:55:24.919
Handsome young men!

01:55:25.044 --> 01:55:26.296
Very nice.

01:55:26.963 --> 01:55:28.631
Let's go.

01:55:32.343 --> 01:55:34.429
<i>The saint's assistant called.</i>

01:55:34.596 --> 01:55:38.182
<i>The saint would like Count
and Countess Odescalchi to come too.</i>

01:55:38.349 --> 01:55:40.852
<i>They treated her like a sister
when she lived here.</i>

01:55:41.144 --> 01:55:44.355
- You know them?
- Of course, but they're not here.

01:55:44.522 --> 01:55:47.900
The nobility are all in London,
at Philip's granddaughter's wedding.

01:55:48.026 --> 01:55:51.154
Let's call the Colonnas of Reggie!

01:55:51.279 --> 01:55:53.114
The nobility for hire? They're dead.

01:55:53.865 --> 01:55:55.867
<i>Nonsense. They're immortal.</i>

01:55:56.034 --> 01:55:59.871
<i>The saint won't even notice.
It's been 70 years.</i>

01:56:12.050 --> 01:56:13.885
Count Colonna speaking.

01:56:15.219 --> 01:56:17.263
Yes, we're available.

01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:19.474
Ah, for tonight.

01:56:20.350 --> 01:56:23.895
Our rate is 250 euros per person
for the evening,

01:56:24.562 --> 01:56:27.732
plus the cost of a rental car.

01:56:29.067 --> 01:56:33.571
What you suggest would be
a bit humiliating for us.

01:56:34.238 --> 01:56:38.910
We're willing to be hired
as the Colonnas of Reggio.

01:56:39.661 --> 01:56:43.164
But passing ourselves off
as the Odescalchis...

01:56:43.998 --> 01:56:45.708
I don't know.

01:56:46.876 --> 01:56:49.671
We were at war for two centuries.

01:56:50.421 --> 01:56:52.757
It feels immoral.

01:56:52.882 --> 01:56:57.095
Cut at least 12 pieces of rabbit,

01:56:57.512 --> 01:57:01.057
leaving aside the kidneys, liver, and head.

01:57:01.391 --> 01:57:03.351
Gently brown.

01:57:04.185 --> 01:57:06.938
Don't forget thyme, bay leaves, and rosemary.

01:57:07.105 --> 01:57:11.442
Then add red wine,
Ligurian olives, and pine nuts.

01:57:12.276 --> 01:57:15.405
And in one hour you have
Ligurian-style rabbit.

01:57:16.197 --> 01:57:18.616
Sister Maria, what convent
are you staying at?

01:57:18.783 --> 01:57:22.578
Actually, we're at the Hassler Hotel

01:57:22.704 --> 01:57:24.580
near the Spanish Steps,

01:57:24.706 --> 01:57:26.457
but Sister Maria finds it uncomfortable.

01:57:26.624 --> 01:57:29.919
I've never heard the Hassler
called "uncomfortable."

01:57:30.044 --> 01:57:31.671
Oh, it's very comfortable...

01:57:31.796 --> 01:57:34.632
but Sister Maria isn't used
to sleeping in a bed.

01:57:35.091 --> 01:57:38.511
She sleeps on a cardboard pallet
on the floor.

01:57:38.636 --> 01:57:40.722
Do you have any visits planned?

01:57:40.847 --> 01:57:42.890
Sister Maria will of course climb

01:57:43.015 --> 01:57:45.435
the Scala Sancta at St. John's on her knees.

01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:48.062
- Have you done that?
- I'd have liked to,

01:57:48.187 --> 01:57:51.149
but I have a bad knee.

01:57:51.274 --> 01:57:53.943
Orthopedic problems are negligible

01:57:54.110 --> 01:57:57.155
in the light of the partial indulgence afforded

01:57:57.280 --> 01:57:58.865
by the Scala Sancta.

01:57:58.990 --> 01:58:00.324
That's true.

01:58:00.491 --> 01:58:03.703
Now, another specialty of mine is lamb with-

01:58:03.828 --> 01:58:06.748
Does Sister Maria still work with the sick?

01:58:06.873 --> 01:58:08.708
Twenty-two hours a day,

01:58:08.833 --> 01:58:10.209
every day-

01:58:10.334 --> 01:58:13.880
She washes them, feeds them.
You ought to see her.

01:58:14.005 --> 01:58:16.966
Despite her age, she doesn't walk, she runs.

01:58:17.091 --> 01:58:19.635
She's tired now,

01:58:19.761 --> 01:58:23.097
but only because she's not with her patients.

01:58:23.389 --> 01:58:24.849
How old is she?

01:58:24.974 --> 01:58:26.893
She'll be 104 in October.

01:58:27.018 --> 01:58:29.353
- That's a lot.
- I thought she was much older.

01:58:29.479 --> 01:58:32.690
Longevity, like everything else,

01:58:32.815 --> 01:58:34.484
is no accident.

01:58:34.776 --> 01:58:37.653
About Sister Maria's interview with Jep-

01:58:37.779 --> 01:58:39.363
Interview?

01:58:39.530 --> 01:58:42.658
There must be some misunderstanding.

01:58:42.784 --> 01:58:45.703
Sister Maria hasn't granted interviews
since 1971,

01:58:45.870 --> 01:58:48.664
after certain people misunderstood

01:58:48.831 --> 01:58:51.375
the reason for her mission in Chad.

01:58:51.876 --> 01:58:55.338
Of course, but considering
her admiration for Jep's work-

01:58:55.463 --> 01:58:57.548
You told rne she enjoyed
<i>The Human Apparatus.</i>

01:58:57.673 --> 01:59:01.052
She found it beautiful and fierce...

01:59:01.302 --> 01:59:03.387
like the world of men.

01:59:03.513 --> 01:59:06.182
Great! There would be no risk
of any misunderstanding,

01:59:06.307 --> 01:59:08.017
Sister Maria can review the text-

01:59:08.142 --> 01:59:11.395
- No, I'm sorry.
- Don't insist.

01:59:11.521 --> 01:59:15.191
I'm sorry if certain false hopes were aroused,

01:59:15.316 --> 01:59:19.362
but there's absolutely no question
of any interview.

01:59:19.487 --> 01:59:21.739
Why do you do all the talking?

01:59:21.906 --> 01:59:24.242
Why not let Sister Maria talk?

01:59:43.427 --> 01:59:45.805
Ma'am...

01:59:48.683 --> 01:59:52.603
I took a vow of poverty.

01:59:54.397 --> 01:59:56.774
And you don't talk

01:59:57.275 --> 01:59:59.277
about poverty.

02:00:00.611 --> 02:00:02.530
You live it.

02:00:13.958 --> 02:00:17.879
Such true and righteous and powerful words!

02:00:22.133 --> 02:00:24.302
Do you need anything, ma'am?

02:00:24.802 --> 02:00:27.138
- She needs the bathroom.
- It's on the left.

02:00:27.305 --> 02:00:30.016
The change of diet isn't good for her.

02:00:30.308 --> 02:00:34.020
In Mali Sister Maria only eats

02:00:34.145 --> 02:00:36.772
1 1/2 ounces of plant roots a day.

02:00:36.898 --> 02:00:40.526
Me too sometimes, in the evening,
as a light meal,

02:00:40.651 --> 02:00:44.071
I fix some splendid bitter roots with lemon.

02:00:44.196 --> 02:00:47.450
You scrape the roots clean with a knife

02:00:47.575 --> 02:00:51.162
and cut them into small chunks-

02:00:51.287 --> 02:00:55.666
Cardinal, remember when we met
at that wedding?

02:00:55.833 --> 02:00:57.835
You were there too.

02:00:58.377 --> 02:01:00.838
I felt the need to ask you

02:01:01.005 --> 02:01:03.507
about matters close to my heart

02:01:03.633 --> 02:01:06.510
involving faith

02:01:06.761 --> 02:01:10.681
and the depths of spirituality.

02:01:10.848 --> 02:01:12.850
But then you got distracted.

02:01:12.975 --> 02:01:14.644
You can ask me now.

02:01:16.646 --> 02:01:19.815
- No, there's no point.
- Why?

02:01:19.982 --> 02:01:23.361
I'd be very disappointed to discover

02:01:23.527 --> 02:01:26.364
you actually had no answers.

02:01:26.948 --> 02:01:30.117
I'm just saying it's a possibility,

02:01:30.242 --> 02:01:31.535
and I think-

02:01:38.042 --> 02:01:39.543
Anyway-

02:01:44.340 --> 02:01:46.384
I apologize for earlier.

02:01:46.634 --> 02:01:50.554
There is one question
I'd really like to ask you.

02:01:51.389 --> 02:01:54.225
Are the rumors true?

02:01:55.059 --> 02:01:57.228
That you were a truly great...

02:01:58.479 --> 02:01:59.981
exorcist?

02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:31.595
Sister Maria!

02:02:32.179 --> 02:02:34.056
Sister Maria!

02:02:36.475 --> 02:02:38.060
Saint.

02:02:46.444 --> 02:02:49.196
Stop saying "saint"!
Her name is Sister Maria.

02:02:49.321 --> 02:02:50.990
Sister Maria.

02:02:51.115 --> 02:02:53.826
Where's that bitch hiding?

02:03:19.226 --> 02:03:20.978
Sister Maria!

02:04:05.523 --> 02:04:08.609
Come, Elisabetta. Let's go to bed.

02:04:08.818 --> 02:04:11.779
You go ahead.
I'm going upstairs for a moment.

02:04:13.072 --> 02:04:15.074
Don't be too late.

02:05:29.815 --> 02:05:32.818
<i>In this room, in 1930,</i>

02:05:32.985 --> 02:05:36.572
<i>Princess Antonietta gave birth
to her only daughter,</i>

02:05:36.697 --> 02:05:39.158
<i>Elisabetta Colonna of Reggie.</i>

02:05:39.283 --> 02:05:42.369
<i>The princess died after giving birth.</i>

02:05:42.494 --> 02:05:45.664
<i>Young Elisabetta, in these opulent rooms,</i>

02:05:45.831 --> 02:05:48.626
<i>led a happy and carefree childhood.</i>

02:05:48.751 --> 02:05:50.753
<i>But a few years later,</i>

02:05:50.878 --> 02:05:54.173
<i>Prince Erminio's financial hardships</i>

02:05:54.298 --> 02:05:57.176
<i>forced him to sell the property.</i>

02:06:34.088 --> 02:06:36.465
They're migrating west,

02:06:36.632 --> 02:06:40.427
but now they're resting.

02:06:54.275 --> 02:06:56.527
Did you know

02:06:57.069 --> 02:07:01.657
that I know the Christian names

02:07:02.074 --> 02:07:06.328
of all of these birds?

02:07:13.961 --> 02:07:15.212
Why...

02:07:17.089 --> 02:07:20.634
did you never write another book?

02:07:26.849 --> 02:07:28.892
I was looking for the great beauty...

02:07:31.145 --> 02:07:32.771
but...

02:07:35.524 --> 02:07:37.276
I never found it.

02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:40.988
Do you know...

02:07:41.864 --> 02:07:43.449
why...

02:07:44.116 --> 02:07:47.244
I only eat roots?

02:07:52.833 --> 02:07:54.501
No, why?

02:08:01.342 --> 02:08:05.554
Because roots are important.

02:10:41.502 --> 02:10:45.214
Now there's something
I want to show you.

02:11:46.692 --> 02:11:48.902
<i>This is how it always ends:</i>

02:11:49.319 --> 02:11:50.487
<i>in death.</i>

02:11:51.613 --> 02:11:54.992
<i>But first there was life...</i>

02:11:55.492 --> 02:11:59.413
<i>hidden beneath the blah, blah, blah.</i>

02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:04.376
<i>Everything's settled to the bottom</i>

02:12:04.543 --> 02:12:07.004
<i>beneath all the hubbub and noise.</i>

02:12:07.754 --> 02:12:11.216
<i>The silence and the emotion...</i>

02:12:11.842 --> 02:12:15.220
<i>the excitement and the fear...</i>

02:12:16.221 --> 02:12:22.019
<i>the fleeting and sporadic flashes of beauty...</i>

02:12:22.519 --> 02:12:27.649
<i>amid the wretched squalor and human misery-</i>

02:12:28.942 --> 02:12:31.903
<i>all buried beneath the awkward predicament</i>

02:12:32.070 --> 02:12:35.866
<i>of existing in this world,
blah, blah, blah.</i>

02:12:38.910 --> 02:12:42.497
<i>What lies beyond lies beyond.</i>

02:12:43.624 --> 02:12:47.085
<i>That is not my concern.</i>

02:12:48.337 --> 02:12:50.047
<i>Therefore...</i>

02:12:50.714 --> 02:12:53.425
<i>let this novel begin.</i>

02:12:54.259 --> 02:12:56.094
<i>After all...</i>

02:12:56.553 --> 02:12:58.722
<i>it's just a trick.</i>

02:12:59.264 --> 02:13:01.099
<i>Yes...</i>

02:13:01.558 --> 02:13:03.226
<i>it's just a trick.</i>

02:13:07.689 --> 02:13:10.067
THE GREAT BEAUTY
