09:05.212 --> 09:07.965
Gosh. That's the nicest gift
I've gotten all night.

09:08.090 --> 09:09.925
Thank you!
Well, I got to go, honey.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.636
Be sure to come back to Raisins
and see me again, okay?

09:12.761 --> 09:15.806
Well, yeah, but --
Hey. Hey -- Hey, Lexus?

09:15.931 --> 09:17.307
Well, I was thinking --

09:17.432 --> 09:19.643
I was thinking that we should go
do something sometime.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.395
Oh, gee.
That would be great, honey.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.397
But I'm really busy this week.
Tell you what.

09:23.522 --> 09:24.523
You come back to Raisins,

09:24.648 --> 09:26.608
and we'll be able to hang out
all we want, okay?

09:26.733 --> 09:28.652
Okay!
- Bye, cutie!

09:28.777 --> 09:30.445
Bye -- Bye, darling!

09:33.198 --> 09:36.618
Wow.
A real-life relationship.

09:42.958 --> 09:43.875
All right, kids.

09:44.001 --> 09:46.461
Out on the gym floor
for P.E. class!

09:51.133 --> 09:53.051
Come on, Stan.
We're gonna play dodge ball.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.886
I can't believe it.

09:55.012 --> 09:57.055
She's in love
with somebody else.

09:57.180 --> 09:59.141
Dude, you need to snap out
of this!

09:59.266 --> 10:00.642
So Wendy left you for Token.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.811
What are you gonna do, just be
miserable your whole life?

10:02.936 --> 10:05.230
There's nothing else I <i>can</i> do.
She <i>was</i> my whole life.

10:05.355 --> 10:06.398
Oh, come on, dude!

10:06.523 --> 10:08.859
All you've done for the last
four days is mope around!

10:08.984 --> 10:11.069
You might as well go hang out
with those goth kids

10:11.194 --> 10:13.322
who dress in black and talk
about pain all the time!

10:13.447 --> 10:14.531
Maybe I should.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.158
At least they
would understand me.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.619
Maybe I should go hang
with the goth kids.

10:19.536 --> 10:22.289
Life is pain.
Life is only pain.

10:22.414 --> 10:25.042
We're all taught to believe
in happy, fairy-tale endings...

10:25.167 --> 10:26.918
but there is only blackness --

10:27.044 --> 10:30.881
dark, depressing loneliness
that eats at your soul.

10:31.006 --> 10:33.383
Who needs that Ken and Barbie
love, anyway?

10:33.508 --> 10:35.969
Everyone's just walking around
like a bunch of conformists.

10:36.094 --> 10:37.387
Go ahead and wear
your business suit

10:37.512 --> 10:40.515
so you can make $34,000 a year
and buy your condominium.

10:40.641 --> 10:42.809
They're all zombies
racing to their graves.

10:42.934 --> 10:44.686
Love didn't work
for my mom and dad.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.605
Why should it work for me?

10:47.522 --> 10:49.024
My dad is such an asshole.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.901
Drunken bastard
doesn't even know I exist,

10:51.026 --> 10:52.944
but then he won't let me go
to the Skinny Puppy concert

10:53.070 --> 10:55.489
because my heroin-addict aunt
is coming over for dinner.

10:55.614 --> 10:57.032
Dinner?
That's a laugh.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.450
Just an excuse for my mom
to bitch at me

10:58.575 --> 10:59.493
for not wearing girly clothes

10:59.618 --> 11:02.162
like the other Britney Spears
wannabes at this school.

11:03.705 --> 11:07.459
They're all a bunch
of Nazi conformist cheerleaders.

11:09.878 --> 11:13.465
But if life is only pain,
then what's the point of living?

11:13.590 --> 11:17.094
Just to make life more
miserable for the conformists.

11:17.219 --> 11:19.054
All right.
So how do I join you?

11:19.179 --> 11:21.056
If you want to be
one of the nonconformists,

11:21.181 --> 11:22.766
all you have to do
is dress just like us

11:22.891 --> 11:25.185
and listen to the same music
we do.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.187
'Kay.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.651
I know it's your first day,
Ferrari,

11:32.776 --> 11:34.236
so I want to go over
the basics with you.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.362
Okay.

11:35.487 --> 11:36.905
First of all,
there's a five-foot rule --

11:37.030 --> 11:38.407
If you come within five feet
of a customer,

11:38.532 --> 11:39.533
you need to acknowledge them,

11:39.658 --> 11:40.784
even if they're not
at your table.

11:40.909 --> 11:42.202
"Hey, cutie!"

11:42.327 --> 11:44.329
When you're not serving food
or talking with customers,

11:44.454 --> 11:45.747
you need to dance around
and have fun.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.124
We have things like Hula-Hoops,
silly strings,

11:47.249 --> 11:48.834
and water guns
to play with the other girls.

11:48.959 --> 11:49.876
Be sure to giggle a lot,

11:50.001 --> 11:51.670
and be sure to show off
your Raisins.

11:51.795 --> 11:53.213
Now, when you take
a customer's order,

11:53.338 --> 11:54.673
you need to sit down
at the table with them.

11:54.798 --> 11:56.174
It makes them think
you're interested.

11:56.299 --> 11:58.510
Write your name down for them
and make them feel special.

11:58.635 --> 12:01.763
"Oh, man, I am so bored.
Thank God <i>you</i> guys came in!"

12:01.888 --> 12:02.848
If you want good tips,

12:02.973 --> 12:04.975
the most important thing
is physical contact.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.268
Just a simple hold of the arm

12:06.393 --> 12:08.770
can be the difference between $5
and $20.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.064
"I'll be right back
with your order, guys!"

12:11.189 --> 12:13.316
Wow.
Thank you so much, Mercedes.

12:13.442 --> 12:15.360
Okay. Well, I guess we're
ready to open for business.

12:15.485 --> 12:16.236
Good luck.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.280
Go ahead and open for business,
Porsche!

12:18.405 --> 12:19.448
Okay!

12:21.616 --> 12:23.452
Hi!
Welcome to Raisins!

12:23.577 --> 12:25.620
Hi!
Is Lexus here?

12:25.746 --> 12:28.290
Hey, cutie!
- Darling!

12:28.415 --> 12:30.000
How are we doing today?

12:30.125 --> 12:33.503
Oh, God.
I missed you so much.

12:33.628 --> 12:36.173
"Shallow life.

12:36.298 --> 12:38.300
Drowning alone, I gasp for air.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.677
Coldness creeps over pale skin.

12:40.802 --> 12:44.264
There is sadness so deep
it pulls me down.

12:44.389 --> 12:47.309
Happiness dies in the deep,
dark sea."

12:47.434 --> 12:49.853
Yeah, happiness dies.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.313
Yeah.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.981
All right.
Your turn, Stan.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.484
Read one of your poems
about pain.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.527
"There is darkness
all around me.

12:57.652 --> 12:59.821
Deep, piercing black.
I cannot breathe.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.156
My heart has been raped."

13:01.281 --> 13:02.073
Whoa.

13:02.199 --> 13:03.492
"The pain is everlasting.

13:03.617 --> 13:04.993
I miss you so much, babe.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.870
Want to hold you
in my arms again, girl.

13:06.995 --> 13:08.330
Want to --"
- Whoa. Whoa. Dude.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.748
Those last two lines
aren't goth.

13:09.873 --> 13:11.041
- They're not?
- No, dude.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.834
You can't say,
"I miss you so much, babe.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.461
I want to hold you in my arms."

13:14.586 --> 13:16.505
Make it,
"I miss seeing you so much,

13:16.630 --> 13:18.924
I want to slice my eyes out
with razor blades."

13:19.049 --> 13:21.343
Henrietta!
Hi, sweetie!

13:21.468 --> 13:23.136
Go away, Mom!
Leave me alone!

13:23.261 --> 13:25.764
Daddy and I just got
your birthday present!

13:25.889 --> 13:28.016
But you can't see what it is
till tomorrow.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.185
You'd like to wait
till I was dead, wouldn't you?

13:30.310 --> 13:32.103
You'd like to see
the maggots eat my face.

13:32.229 --> 13:34.564
You are so creative, honey.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.858
Conformist bitch.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.360
Yeah.

Whoo-hoo!

13:40.362 --> 13:41.655
All right!
Yeah!

13:44.366 --> 13:46.910
Thanks for calling Raisins!
This is Porsche!

13:47.035 --> 13:49.162
Have you tried
our Double-Whammy Wings?

13:49.287 --> 13:52.749

This is her boyfriend.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.961

This is Lexus!

13:56.086 --> 13:56.962
Hey, Lexus!

13:57.087 --> 13:59.506
Hi, sweetie!
Who's this?

13:59.631 --> 14:01.091
It's me -- Butters!

14:01.216 --> 14:03.426
Oh, okay.
Hi, cutie!

14:03.552 --> 14:07.097
Hey, sweetie!
So, how are you, honey?

14:07.222 --> 14:09.307
I'm fine.
I miss you, though.

14:09.432 --> 14:11.351
Yeah.
School was pretty tough today.

14:11.476 --> 14:14.104
We had two quizzes,
and one of them was a pop quiz.

14:14.229 --> 14:16.356
Sometimes I think our classes
are too hard.

14:16.481 --> 14:18.692
But I thought about you
all day long, I promise!

14:18.817 --> 14:21.570
So, how is your day going?
- Good, good!

14:21.695 --> 14:24.197
H-Hey, sweetie, I was thinking
tonight you could come over

14:24.322 --> 14:26.575
and we could watch
"The Exorcist" on DVD!

14:26.700 --> 14:28.618
Oh, gee.
I don't know, cutie.

14:28.743 --> 14:30.871
Why don't you just come down
to Raisins?

14:30.996 --> 14:33.206
W-Well, I kind of don't have
any money left.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.709
I spent it all at Raisins
the last six times.

14:35.834 --> 14:39.170
Oh, that's too bad, cutie.
I really want to see you!

14:39.296 --> 14:41.172
Oh, I really want to see you,
too, baby!

14:41.298 --> 14:42.883
Don't -- Don't worry,
I'll get more money!

14:43.008 --> 14:44.926

Got to run!

14:45.051 --> 14:47.095
Okay.
Uh, hey, Lexus.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.681

No. Wait.

Oh, no, Butters.
You got an advance two days ago.

15:07.032 --> 15:08.450
But I spent it all!

15:08.575 --> 15:10.619
What are you spending

You can come along, but don't
embarrass me or nothing.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.514
I'm sure she'll be real nervous
to impress you.

15:31.640 --> 15:32.432
Don't worry, Butters.

15:32.557 --> 15:34.809
We just want to say hi and then
we'll leave you two alone.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.186
Okay!

15:37.395 --> 15:38.271
You see?

15:38.396 --> 15:40.357

gonna sit here all night again

15:51.743 --> 15:53.119
and drink $6 worth of coffee?

15:53.244 --> 15:55.413
Why don't you get a life?!

15:56.039 --> 15:57.082
Conformist.

15:57.207 --> 15:58.583
Have fun in your rat-race life,

15:58.708 --> 16:00.835
living paycheck to paycheck
for corporate gains.

16:00.961 --> 16:01.920
Yeah.

16:02.045 --> 16:03.838
Dude, you haven't drank
your coffee.

16:03.964 --> 16:05.173
I don't drink coffee.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.343
You can't be a nonconformist
if you don't drink coffee.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.057
Oh, Jesus Christ!
I had to see it to believe it.

16:14.182 --> 16:15.350
What the hell are you doing?

16:16.101 --> 16:20.063
Breathing deep the darkness
that envelops my soul.

16:20.188 --> 16:22.357
God damn it, dude. Your mom
and dad want you to come home.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.109
So they can fill my head
with more Disney lies

16:24.234 --> 16:25.360
about how perfect the world is?

16:25.485 --> 16:26.361
I don't think so.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.571
Yeah, why don't you just go back
to your Justin Timberlake

16:28.697 --> 16:30.448
and your homework,
you conformist asshole?

16:30.573 --> 16:32.200
You just don't know
what real pain is.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.618
Oh, like <i>you</i> know what pain is!

16:33.743 --> 16:35.954
Go try living in a third-world
country, you little pussy.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.205
I'm not gonna live in
a third-world country

16:37.330 --> 16:38.289
with all the conformists.

16:38.415 --> 16:39.416
Stan, this is it --

16:39.541 --> 16:41.292
time to stop feeling sorry
for yourself and come home.

16:41.418 --> 16:43.211
Everyone cares about you
and everyone wants you back.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.338
What about Wendy?
Is she still with Token?

16:45.463 --> 16:46.506
Yeah, she is.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.049
Then people shouldn't care
about me,

16:48.174 --> 16:49.509
because I don't care about them.

16:49.634 --> 16:51.845
What's the point of caring
when all it brings is pain?

16:51.970 --> 16:53.179
For sure.

16:53.304 --> 16:54.764
Fine.
That's it. I give up.

16:54.889 --> 16:56.641
Have fun being miserable.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.184
Conformist.

16:58.309 --> 16:59.978
Yeah.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.858
Here we are, Mom and Dad!

17:06.276 --> 17:08.820
Hi! Welcome to Raisins!
Three of you?

17:08.945 --> 17:11.156
Hi, Mercedes.
It's me -- Lexus' boyfriend.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.782
I brought my parents over
to meet her.

17:12.907 --> 17:15.243
Great. Be sure to try
our Cheddar Poppers.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.745

Raisins Girls calendar for $5?!

17:24.210 --> 17:25.295
I don't know.

17:25.420 --> 17:28.048
Here you go.
Porsche will be right with you.

17:28.173 --> 17:30.884
Go ahead and have a seat, guys.
I got to go find Lexus!

17:32.469 --> 17:34.846
Hey, cutie.
You having a good time?

17:34.971 --> 17:35.805
Yeah.

17:35.930 --> 17:38.058
Oh, boy.
I think I know what's happened.

17:38.183 --> 17:39.350
Our son hasn't learned yet

17:39.476 --> 17:41.352
that girls will pretend
to like him for money.

17:41.478 --> 17:44.522
This place is horrible --
to objectify girls like this.

17:44.647 --> 17:46.357
Hi, guys.
Can I take your order?

17:46.483 --> 17:48.818
Little girl,
you shouldn't be working here.

17:48.943 --> 17:51.488
I shouldn't? Where am I
supposed to be working?

17:51.613 --> 17:53.198
No, I mean you shouldn't
work somewhere

17:53.323 --> 17:54.866
where you're paid
for how you look.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.159
You should be learning a skill

17:56.284 --> 17:58.870
so you can grow up to be a
businesswoman or even a doctor.

17:58.995 --> 18:00.371
Who knows?
You could cure cancer.

18:00.497 --> 18:02.040
I could cure cancer?

18:02.165 --> 18:04.167
Oh, my God.
That would be so cool!

18:04.292 --> 18:07.879
I had a cancer sore on my lip
once, and it hurt so bad!

18:08.588 --> 18:09.798
Oh.
Never mind.

18:09.923 --> 18:12.133
I think Raisins might be
the perfect place for you.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.010
Cool!

18:14.135 --> 18:16.930
Mom, Dad, this is Lexus.

18:17.055 --> 18:19.057
Hi!
Welcome to Raisins!

18:19.182 --> 18:21.684
Uh, Butters, can we have
a little talk with you?

18:21.810 --> 18:23.019
- Outside.
- Huh?

18:23.144 --> 18:26.731
Anything you have to say to me,
you can say in front of Lexus.

18:26.856 --> 18:30.110
Butters, these girls pretend
to be interested in you

18:30.235 --> 18:32.070
because they know
you'll give them tips.

18:32.195 --> 18:33.071
Huh?

18:33.196 --> 18:34.114
You see, Butters,

18:34.239 --> 18:37.158
women know that they can make
men do anything by flirting.

18:37.283 --> 18:41.204
And some girls, like these,
turn that into a profession.

18:41.329 --> 18:42.747
Oh.
I see.

18:42.872 --> 18:44.624
You don't approve
of my girlfriend!

18:44.749 --> 18:46.501
Well, let me tell <i>you</i> something,
Mom and Dad,

18:46.626 --> 18:48.586
our love is as pure
as a mountain spring!

18:48.711 --> 18:50.004
The odds may be stacked
against us,

18:50.130 --> 18:51.506
but we're gonna give it
our best shot!

18:51.631 --> 18:53.258
And so if you can't be happy
for us,

18:53.383 --> 18:55.802
you can just go to heck,
mom and dad!

18:55.927 --> 18:56.719
Come on, Lexus!

18:56.845 --> 18:59.055
I'm moving out of my parents'
house and moving in with you.

18:59.180 --> 19:00.723
Let's blow this joint!

19:00.849 --> 19:02.267
What are you talking about, kid?

19:02.392 --> 19:04.519
We are not boyfriend
and girlfriend.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.980
What?
Lexus, what are you saying?

19:07.105 --> 19:10.441
Are you saying...you don't
want to be together anymore?

19:10.567 --> 19:12.277
I'm sorry, sweetie.

19:12.402 --> 19:15.155
So that's it?
We're broken up now?

19:15.280 --> 19:17.657
I got to get these curly fries
to table 12.

19:19.576 --> 19:20.910
Well, go ahead and go.

19:21.035 --> 19:22.620
It's best we don't say
anything more.

19:22.745 --> 19:24.455
There's nothing left to say.

19:24.581 --> 19:25.874
It's over.

19:25.999 --> 19:28.293
Our relationship is o-over.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.671
♪ I'm all out of love ♪

19:31.796 --> 19:34.174
♪ I'm so lost without you ♪

19:34.299 --> 19:36.050
♪ I know you were right ♪

19:36.176 --> 19:38.803
♪ Believing for so long ♪

19:38.928 --> 19:40.513
♪ I'm all out of love ♪

19:40.638 --> 19:42.891
Look at that --
another tortured soul.

19:43.016 --> 19:44.809
Another life of pain.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.771
Hey, Raven, check it out.

19:48.897 --> 19:49.981
Butters?

19:50.106 --> 19:51.149
Oh.

19:51.274 --> 19:52.775
Oh, hey -- hey, Stan.

19:52.901 --> 19:54.152
What's the matter with you?

19:54.277 --> 19:55.486
Well...

19:55.612 --> 19:57.822
My -- My girlfriend
broke up with me.

19:57.947 --> 20:00.992
Did she step on your heart
with stiletto shoes?

20:01.117 --> 20:02.202
Yeah.

20:02.327 --> 20:03.745
Sure does hurt.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.581
That's cool. I guess you can
join up with us if you want.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.917
We're gonna go to the graveyard
and write poems about death

20:09.042 --> 20:10.835
and how pointless life is.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.754
Oh, no, thanks.

20:12.879 --> 20:13.922
I-I love life.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.216
Huh?
But you just got dumped.

20:16.341 --> 20:18.092
Well, yeah, and I'm sad.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.011
But at the same time,
I'm really happy

20:20.136 --> 20:22.013
that something can make me
feel that sad.

20:22.138 --> 20:25.016
It's like...it -- it makes me
feel alive, you know?

20:25.141 --> 20:26.559
It makes me feel human.

20:26.684 --> 20:28.603
The only way I could feel
this sad now

20:28.728 --> 20:30.897
is if I felt something
really good before,

20:31.022 --> 20:32.899
so I have to take the bad
with the good.

20:33.024 --> 20:36.069
So I guess what I'm feeling
is like a beautiful sadness.

20:36.194 --> 20:37.946
I guess that sounds stupid.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.073
Yeah.
- No.

20:40.198 --> 20:42.367
No, Butters. That doesn't
sound stupid at all.

20:42.492 --> 20:44.535
Thanks for offering to let me
in your clique, guys,

20:44.661 --> 20:46.788
but to be honest, I'd rather be
a crying little pussy

20:46.913 --> 20:48.331
than a faggy goth kid.

20:48.456 --> 20:49.415
We'll see ya, Stan.

20:51.376 --> 20:52.752
He's right.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.545
I don't even know who I am
anymore.

20:54.671 --> 20:56.756
I like liking life
a lot more than hating it.

20:56.881 --> 20:59.008
Screw you guys.
I'm going home.

21:00.468 --> 21:03.596
Go ahead and go back
to your sunshine fairy tale!

21:08.142 --> 21:11.354
Okay. It's third down!
Now, somebody make a play!

21:11.479 --> 21:12.814
Hey.
Can I join in?

21:12.939 --> 21:13.815
What happened?

21:13.940 --> 21:15.692
Aren't you still wallowing
in pain?

21:15.817 --> 21:17.694
Yeah, it still hurts a lot,
but I just realized

21:17.819 --> 21:19.946
that there's gonna be a lot
of painful times in life,

21:20.071 --> 21:22.824
so I'd better learn to deal
with it the right way.

21:23.825 --> 21:25.660
Hey, Wendy.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.328
You're a bitch.

21:27.453 --> 21:29.956
Token?
Right here, buddy.

21:32.542 --> 21:34.627
Oh, dude, it's -- it's good
to have you back.

21:34.752 --> 21:36.587
Yeah.
Let's play ball.
