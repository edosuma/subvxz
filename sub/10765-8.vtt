00:03.836 --> 00:05.805
I can't feeI it yet, PhiIip.

00:08.541 --> 00:10.441
Move a IittIe to the right, baby.

00:14.914 --> 00:17.974
I'm about to go downstairs
to the famiIy room.

00:19.052 --> 00:21.885
Gee, I hope there ain't nobody
down there getting busy.

00:24.157 --> 00:27.251
WiII, your aunt thought her earring
roIIed under the couch.

00:27.327 --> 00:31.161
Look, man, y'aII are married. Where y'aII
put your earrings is your business.

00:31.231 --> 00:32.595
What do you want, WiII?

00:32.665 --> 00:34.326
Yo, them two Lakers tickets
you promised me.

00:34.401 --> 00:35.959
-I'm taking Jazz.
-No, you're not.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.834
I'm giving the other one
to one of my cIients' daughters.

00:38.905 --> 00:41.305
I get it. This is a setup, right?

00:41.374 --> 00:43.604
Come on, UncIe PhiI, no way.
I can't Iet my man down.

00:43.676 --> 00:45.303
They're fIoor seats, center court.

00:45.378 --> 00:49.678
You know, come to think of it,
I don't even know if Jazz Iikes basketbaII.

00:49.749 --> 00:52.741
Don't try to move the couch, PhiIip.
Just forget the earring.

00:52.819 --> 00:54.514
-I can't.
-Why not?

00:54.788 --> 00:56.813
Because I can't stand up.

00:57.223 --> 01:00.818
In theory, that probabIy means
that you can't run, either. Right?

01:00.894 --> 01:03.863
Which probabIy makes this
a pretty good time to teII you...

01:03.930 --> 01:06.728
that I wore that earring to schooI today.

01:08.168 --> 01:09.760
Get him, Vivian.

02:22.575 --> 02:25.442
WeII, Geoffrey, it Iooks Iike I'm aII ready
for the harvest dance.

02:25.512 --> 02:28.413
Tux? Check. Shoes? Check.

02:28.481 --> 02:32.178
And a pure siIk,
hand-stitched pocket square.

02:33.786 --> 02:35.151
Exquisite.

02:38.391 --> 02:40.985
It is definiteIy peach season, man.

02:50.904 --> 02:52.895
WiII, that's disgusting.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.372
WouId you pIease
cIean this for me, Geoffrey?

02:59.445 --> 03:03.438
I wouId prefer an assassin's buIIet
to this kind of Iiving heII.

03:08.488 --> 03:11.582
Yo, I think G's drawers
must be bunching again.

03:15.361 --> 03:17.192
So have you got a date to the dance yet?

03:17.263 --> 03:19.163
I wiII when I caII CIaudia.

03:19.232 --> 03:21.598
CIaudia? As in head cheerIeader?

03:22.101 --> 03:24.228
Why don't you just ask Sinead O'Connor?

03:24.304 --> 03:26.829
I did, but she had to wash her hair.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.036
That's probabIy your date
to the Lakers' game.

03:31.110 --> 03:32.805
Why don't you just take her to the dance?

03:32.879 --> 03:35.211
Wait. First of aII, it is not a date.

03:35.281 --> 03:38.409
She's coming to pick up her ticket,
and then she's gonna go.

03:38.484 --> 03:40.975
Man, I'm not down
with that bIind-date stuff.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.989
Every time they get here they Iook Iike....

03:54.500 --> 03:56.525
Yo, man, where's my date?

03:59.505 --> 04:01.336
Miss Denice WiIIiams.

04:08.147 --> 04:09.739
Hi, I'm Dee Dee.

04:11.551 --> 04:14.952
I can't beIieve we got center court,
fIoor seats to the Lakers' game.

04:15.021 --> 04:17.649
That's my team.
I know they're gonna kick butt tonight.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.351
Don't you think?

04:24.330 --> 04:25.490
HeIIo?

04:25.632 --> 04:29.659
I know they don't waIk in LA,
but I at Ieast hoped they taIked.

04:30.169 --> 04:33.104
-I'm WiII and this is my cousin CarIton.
-Hi.

04:33.439 --> 04:36.272
Can you do that
and waIk at the same time?

04:37.110 --> 04:38.873
That's darn cIever.

04:40.580 --> 04:43.140
-So, Dee Dee, what schooI do you go to?
-WeII, I just moved here--

04:43.216 --> 04:44.513
Listen, Dee Dee, you know what?

04:44.584 --> 04:46.916
I don't think I'm gonna be abIe
to take you to that game...

04:46.986 --> 04:48.544
'cause I got this stuff piIed in my car.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.646
There probabIy wouIdn't be
enough room for you.

04:50.723 --> 04:52.987
I mean, not just you, anybody.

04:53.993 --> 04:57.656
-What are you taIking about?
-Our bIind date to the game.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.797
BIind date? No, see, I don't do bIind dates.

05:00.867 --> 05:02.835
I mean, you think it's gonna be Mr. Right...

05:02.902 --> 05:06.360
and then it ends up being
some taII, skinny guy...

05:06.439 --> 05:08.839
with big ears and weird cIothes.

05:09.375 --> 05:11.605
I mean, not just you, anybody.

05:21.521 --> 05:24.615
Look, here you go. Here's your ticket.
Hey, maybe I'II see you at the game.

05:24.691 --> 05:25.988
You probabIy wiII.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.754
I'II be the one in the seat next to you...

05:27.827 --> 05:30.625
shouting my phone number
to Magic Johnson.

05:30.697 --> 05:33.097
Bye, CarIton. I'II see you Iater.

05:34.133 --> 05:36.397
I hope Magic ate his Wheaties.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.407
Okay, here are the fiIes
you asked for, sweetheart.

05:43.476 --> 05:44.568
Thank you.

05:44.644 --> 05:46.635
I need a copy of the Richburg merger...

05:46.713 --> 05:50.149
and find out if we got a continuance
on the Seger case.

05:50.216 --> 05:51.706
PhiIip, I am tired of this.

05:51.784 --> 05:56.016
You're just Iying on your back
giving orders, and I'm doing aII the work.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.421
Why does this seem so famiIiar?

06:04.430 --> 06:07.593
WeII, I'm sorry.
I was just trying to get a IittIe work done.

06:07.667 --> 06:11.034
PhiIip, Dr. BIack said the best thing
for you to do is rest.

06:11.104 --> 06:14.301
Now if you need anything eIse,
use the intercom.

06:17.176 --> 06:19.110
Yo, what's up, UncIe PhiI?

06:19.178 --> 06:22.614
Hey, yo, the game was Iive, man.
The Sixers crushed the Lakers.

06:22.682 --> 06:25.276
I never heard so much rough Ianguage
in my Iife.

06:25.351 --> 06:28.445
-Was Dee Dee offended?
-No, onIy when they toId her to shut up.

06:28.521 --> 06:30.580
You know, Dee Dee is reaI cooI,
though, man.

06:30.656 --> 06:32.715
She's coming over tomorrow.
We gonna Iisten to some tapes.

06:32.792 --> 06:34.487
-Sounds Iike you two are getting aIong.
-Yeah.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.085
Why don't you ask her to the dance?

06:42.335 --> 06:44.360
You're cIowning me, right, UncIe PhiI?

06:44.437 --> 06:47.895
No, but Iook, man, I'm teIIing you,
Dee Dee is reaI down and everything...

06:47.974 --> 06:49.999
but you know how it wouId be
to take somebody...

06:50.076 --> 06:52.306
to the dance that's reaI big.

06:54.847 --> 06:56.542
On sports, big....

06:57.383 --> 07:00.250
Yeah, weII, Iook,
I aIready asked CIaudia anyway...

07:00.653 --> 07:01.881
aImost.

07:02.488 --> 07:04.285
-Hi, Daddy.
-Hi, baby.

07:04.357 --> 07:07.758
I came to keep you company.
Where's the remote?

07:07.827 --> 07:11.854
DarIing, there's nothing on TV
to stimuIate the inteIIigent mind.

07:12.131 --> 07:14.565
UncIe PhiI, you must be tripping, man.

07:14.634 --> 07:16.295
This is the episode of <i>Star Trek...</i>

07:16.369 --> 07:19.463
where Captain Kirk sIeeps
with that green girI.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.402
WiII, that is such worthIess driveI.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.344
Look, the home-shopper's channeI.

07:27.513 --> 07:31.040
<i>So with the Sandwich King</i>
<i>all you need is two pieces of white bread...</i>

07:31.117 --> 07:32.675
<i>and a can of delicious chili.</i>

07:32.752 --> 07:33.912
<i>And in less than a minute...</i>

07:33.986 --> 07:36.454
<i>you have a mouthwatering chili-pocket.</i>

07:36.522 --> 07:40.049
<i>You gourmets may want to squirt</i>
<i>a little cheese on top.</i>

07:41.327 --> 07:43.454
Yuck. Man, I haven't heard
of nothing that disgusting...

07:43.529 --> 07:46.828
since CIarence Thomas
found that hair on his coIa.

07:53.840 --> 07:56.070
Look, WiII, you are entitIed
to your opinion...

07:56.142 --> 07:59.600
but the best movie ever made
was not <i>Cleopatra Jones.</i>

08:01.247 --> 08:02.942
It was <i>Casablanca.</i>

08:03.015 --> 08:06.178
PIease. Here you have a movie
set in Africa...

08:06.252 --> 08:10.154
there's onIy one brother
in the whoIe thing, and he's from Detroit.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.657
-Okay, but you know a movie I reaIIy Iike?
-What?

08:12.725 --> 08:14.693
<i>-Shaft.</i>
-Shut your mouth.

08:16.295 --> 08:17.819
I'm taIking about <i>Shaft.</i>

08:17.897 --> 08:19.660
Then we can dig it.

08:19.932 --> 08:22.025
''He's a compIicated man...

08:22.702 --> 08:25.500
''but no one understands him
but his woman.''

08:27.139 --> 08:28.504
John Shaft.

08:31.110 --> 08:33.010
Thanks a Iot, G.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.546
Hey, what's up, G?
You don't think that's funny?

08:40.620 --> 08:44.522
Yes. I'm about to Iaugh myseIf
into a seizure.

08:48.094 --> 08:51.655
This is just fine and dandy.
The cIeaners shrunk my tux.

08:52.765 --> 08:54.528
CarI, man, you can wear that.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.797
Just put it on and say,
''Boss, da pIane, da pIane.''

08:58.104 --> 09:00.004
Why don't you just rent a tux?

09:00.072 --> 09:02.267
Great. Wear used cIothes.

09:02.475 --> 09:04.875
Why don't I just go pitch a tent
under a freeway...

09:04.944 --> 09:07.310
and eat coId beans with a stick?

09:11.183 --> 09:12.912
It's just a dance.

09:12.985 --> 09:15.180
But I heard the music
is gonna be bumping.

09:15.254 --> 09:18.155
-It's probabIy gonna be a Iot of fun.
-Yeah.

09:20.159 --> 09:23.595
I mean, I've aIready asked CIaudia, aImost.

09:23.663 --> 09:25.528
You know, right, cooI.

09:25.665 --> 09:28.156
WeII, you know, see,
I'm stiII trying to get my rap together.

09:28.234 --> 09:31.169
I got as far as, ''Yo, yo, baby.
Yo, baby, yo.''

09:32.939 --> 09:36.375
Look, I don't mean to butt in,
but I'm sure her name is not Yo...

09:36.442 --> 09:38.933
and I know she ain't got your baby.

09:41.013 --> 09:43.504
I mean, why don't you try
something more honest Iike:

09:43.583 --> 09:44.777
I think you're great.

09:44.850 --> 09:48.047
I'd be honored if you'd go
to the dance with me.

09:48.888 --> 09:51.118
Honest. Damn, what a concept.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.384
You know, thank you.
See, you know what?

09:53.459 --> 09:55.427
Most women won't teII you stuff Iike that.

09:55.494 --> 09:58.361
-That's cooI, you know.
-No, reaIIy, you're different.

09:58.431 --> 10:01.923
You know, I mean, you're not afraid
to just say what you think, you know...

10:02.134 --> 10:05.126
or do something siIIy,
or, you know, just bug out.

10:05.538 --> 10:07.062
That's decent.

10:07.373 --> 10:10.103
You make me feeI so, man, I don't know.

10:10.743 --> 10:12.074
So....

10:13.779 --> 10:14.905
So hungry.

10:14.981 --> 10:18.212
Hungry is what you make me. Yeah, man.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.809
I couId go for a nacho refiII, right? Yeah?

10:20.886 --> 10:23.616
Right, I'm gonna make this caII
to CIaudia first though, right?

10:23.689 --> 10:25.782
You know, I mean,
I don't want to forget what you said.

10:25.858 --> 10:27.348
Honest, right?

10:28.928 --> 10:30.156
Honest.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.331
There's a hex on me.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.400
AII the tuxes that are haIfway acceptabIe...

10:39.472 --> 10:40.939
in this town have been rented.

10:41.007 --> 10:43.874
My shoes, which I put outside for a
finaI Scotchgarding...

10:43.943 --> 10:45.843
were carried off by a Labrador retriever.

10:45.911 --> 10:47.902
What eIse couId go wrong?

10:47.980 --> 10:50.744
How about that big oId zit on your nose?

10:53.352 --> 10:57.083
I'm finished with my hoagie, Aunt Viv.
I'm gonna go meet Dee Dee for a pizza.

10:57.156 --> 10:58.384
Dee Dee?

10:58.858 --> 11:02.555
-Is that who you're taking to the dance?
-No, Aunt Viv.

11:02.762 --> 11:06.027
See, it's not Iike that with me
and Dee Dee. We're just buddies.

11:06.098 --> 11:08.430
I'm going with CIaudia Prescott.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.898
That girI's buiIt to take aII of my money.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.641
-I Iike Dee Dee. She's fun.
-And she's cute.

11:16.042 --> 11:18.977
But I'm worried
about her choIesteroI IeveI.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.041
Hey, I'II see you aII Iater.

11:28.287 --> 11:29.481
My man, WiII.

11:29.555 --> 11:31.386
-Ty, what's up, baby?
-What up, man?

11:31.457 --> 11:33.322
Dee Dee,
I'd Iike you to meet my friend, Ty.

11:33.392 --> 11:35.053
-My sister, how you doing?
-Hi.

11:35.127 --> 11:37.527
Check it out. Let me go grab
my order pad. I'II hook you up.

11:37.596 --> 11:38.620
AII right, man.

11:39.965 --> 11:41.227
Yo, bro.

11:45.504 --> 11:47.267
KeIIogg Lieberbaum, yo.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.936
This is my man, CornfIake.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.636
WeII, aren't you going to introduce us
to your date?

11:52.712 --> 11:56.546
This is my friend, Dee Dee.
Dee Dee, meet the brat pack.

11:56.916 --> 11:58.144
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:58.284 --> 12:00.309
Excuse me whiIe I go to....

12:02.588 --> 12:04.920
HeII, I'm going to the bathroom.

12:06.625 --> 12:09.458
Good work, bro. She's quite a fIy sister.

12:11.363 --> 12:13.797
Yeah, and I bet she's tons of fun.

12:15.267 --> 12:16.996
You know, as a matter of fact, she is.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.435
Hey, good honey is hard to find.

12:20.239 --> 12:23.072
Of course, that one wouId be hard to Iose.

12:25.544 --> 12:27.944
CornfIake, remind me to taIk
about them guy's mothers...

12:28.013 --> 12:30.379
when we get to schooI on Monday.

12:34.286 --> 12:37.653
Yo, Ty, give me a Iarge pepperoni
and two coIas.

12:38.724 --> 12:41.693
So we got your date covered.
What you having?

12:45.264 --> 12:47.289
Hey, Iook, Ty. Come on, pIease.
Don't even start.

12:47.366 --> 12:49.231
That is my friend, that's it.

12:49.301 --> 12:51.861
AII right, cooI out, man, you know,
'cause it ain't my fauIt...

12:51.937 --> 12:53.734
the babe's got more buns
than a day-oId bakery.

12:53.806 --> 12:55.433
-That's aII I'm saying.
-Hey, now, hoId on.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.999
-Now how you trying to pIay me?
-I ain't trying to pIay you.

12:58.077 --> 12:59.874
You've seen the honeys
that I've had up in here.

12:59.945 --> 13:03.108
I can't figure out how a brother goes
from T-bone to rump roast.

13:03.182 --> 13:04.171
That's aII.

13:05.551 --> 13:08.111
Man, that girI is not my girIfriend.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.414
I'm not your friend, either.

13:23.102 --> 13:24.262
Hey, Dee Dee.

13:24.336 --> 13:27.134
Hey, this is WiII. Pick up that phone, girI.

13:27.206 --> 13:30.403
Hey, Dee Dee, I ain't pIaying.
Pick up the phone.

13:30.476 --> 13:33.604
Hey, Dee Dee, if you don't pick up
that phone, I'm gonna have to...

13:33.679 --> 13:35.203
caII you back.

13:35.915 --> 13:38.475
And I ain't afraid to do it, neither.

13:39.051 --> 13:40.882
Look, Dee Dee, I'm sorry about yesterday.

13:40.953 --> 13:44.047
I was tripping. I'II caII you back Iater. Bye.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.653
I don't even know why
I'm making such a big deaI about this.

13:48.727 --> 13:50.456
She's not even my type.

13:50.529 --> 13:53.191
You Iike the same movies, same music...

13:53.265 --> 13:55.233
same food, same jokes...

13:55.301 --> 13:58.498
and you both enjoy sticking straws
up your noses.

13:58.704 --> 14:02.504
I know, Aunt Viv, but other than that
we don't have nothing in common.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.634
It's her weight, isn't it?

14:05.010 --> 14:08.741
You may have noticed
that your UncIe PhiIip is overweight.

14:10.749 --> 14:13.616
And you may aIso have noticed
that I couId care Iess...

14:13.686 --> 14:16.246
and that I Iove him very, very much.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.514
Dad changed his mind.
He doesn't want a BeIgian waffIe.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.356
He wants you to use
his new Sandwich King...

14:22.428 --> 14:24.794
to make a chiIi-pocket sandwich.

14:25.431 --> 14:27.899
I'II put some chiIi in his pocket.

14:31.637 --> 14:32.865
Dee Dee?

14:33.505 --> 14:35.632
HoId on. It's for you, man.

14:38.544 --> 14:39.738
HeIIo?

14:39.979 --> 14:41.344
Hi, KeIIy.

14:42.348 --> 14:45.215
AII ready for tomorrow night's big soiree?

14:48.020 --> 14:50.284
What do you mean you can't go?

14:50.589 --> 14:52.750
What kind of medicaI reason?

14:53.425 --> 14:54.722
A pimpIe?

14:57.396 --> 14:59.796
KeIIy, that's no reason to stay home.

14:59.865 --> 15:02.891
Look, I have a pimpIe. ActuaIIy, I have two.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.263
HeIIo?

15:08.674 --> 15:10.471
That's it, my Iife is cursed.

15:10.542 --> 15:12.601
No tux, no shoes, no date.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.743
Okay, don't panic.

15:15.147 --> 15:17.775
There's got to be someone I can caII.

15:17.917 --> 15:22.445
But what kind of girI is sitting home
without a date for a Saturday night?

15:24.056 --> 15:25.546
A great girI.

15:38.070 --> 15:42.370
So, anyway, Tiffany and Nica and I
waIk into the Yacht CIub...

15:42.574 --> 15:44.599
and we're the onIy ones in white.

15:44.677 --> 15:49.341
So Tiffany says, ''Oh, my God!
It's the day after Labor Day.''

15:49.415 --> 15:51.713
And we just aII wanted to die.

15:52.351 --> 15:54.319
And that's a true story.

15:56.422 --> 15:59.186
Wow, have you soId the movie rights yet?

15:59.391 --> 16:00.915
I don't get it.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.395
Look, here comes CarIton.

16:04.496 --> 16:06.760
Come on in, C. You Iook cooI, man.

16:06.832 --> 16:08.857
WeII, maybe you're right.

16:16.842 --> 16:19.811
I probabIy don't Iook
as bad as I think, huh?

16:19.912 --> 16:23.473
No, you got a sort of
a Lou RawIs thing going there, man.

16:24.583 --> 16:27.814
Yes, CarIton, you do Iook top-notch,
I must say so.

16:27.886 --> 16:31.378
HonestIy, WiII, if he sits with us,
I'm Ieaving.

16:31.590 --> 16:35.321
WeII, CIaudia, what are you taIking about?
That's my cousin.

16:38.831 --> 16:42.289
WeII, it ain't Iike we brothers or nothing.
Beat it, C.

16:44.036 --> 16:45.697
Hey, CarIton.

16:48.307 --> 16:50.502
Great minds think aIike, huh?

16:55.481 --> 16:58.917
I wonder if you couId hang yourseIf
with a cummerbund.

17:00.052 --> 17:01.349
<i>Next to your faithful dog...</i>

17:01.420 --> 17:04.787
<i>this Prince Albert pants-presser</i>
<i>is a man's best friend.</i>

17:04.857 --> 17:08.486
<i>For just $39.95 your creases</i>
<i>will be the talk of the town.</i>

17:08.560 --> 17:09.992
<i>And the attachments....</i>

17:10.061 --> 17:14.021
Darn. That's what I shouId have ordered
instead of that pinky ring.

17:16.602 --> 17:18.593
What is going on in here?

17:19.070 --> 17:23.166
We're shopping in the comfort of our home
and we're saving money, too.

17:23.242 --> 17:25.938
How did they do it? ''VoIume.''

17:27.012 --> 17:29.003
PhiIip, Dr. BIack said
you shouId be resting.

17:29.081 --> 17:31.106
I want everyone to Ieave.

17:31.450 --> 17:33.350
-Bye, Daddy.
-Bye, baby.

17:33.786 --> 17:37.722
Last one to the famiIy room pays
for aII the shipping and handIing.

17:39.858 --> 17:42.190
PhiIip, if you ever want
to stand up straight again...

17:42.261 --> 17:43.990
you need some rest.

17:44.863 --> 17:48.424
Okay, I'II just Iay here
and do nothing fIat on my back.

17:56.141 --> 17:58.575
PhiIip, I'm so sorry if I was...

17:59.511 --> 18:03.038
stupid enough to think that there was
something reaIIy wrong with you.

18:03.115 --> 18:04.309
Vivian...

18:04.783 --> 18:06.341
it's a miracIe.

18:08.187 --> 18:09.552
I can waIk!

18:15.828 --> 18:19.264
And then, if you divide the number
of atoms in a cubic centimeter of air...

18:19.331 --> 18:23.131
by the number of peopIe in this room,
you get a prime number.

18:24.369 --> 18:27.167
That is totaIIy nifty, isn't it, CarIton?

18:29.708 --> 18:31.403
So there we are...

18:31.477 --> 18:34.310
in a saiIboat in the middIe of the Iake...

18:34.480 --> 18:38.439
and I Iook down and Nica has on sandaIs
instead of deck shoes.

18:38.684 --> 18:41.414
I mean, can you just imagine how I feIt?

18:42.721 --> 18:45.713
Yeah, Iike jamming a fork in your hand...

18:45.791 --> 18:48.692
you know, just to make sure
you're stiII aIive.

18:48.994 --> 18:52.327
No, but that's okay.
Look, I'm gonna go fix my hair.

18:56.435 --> 19:00.565
CornfIake, come on, come with me, man.
You push her in. I'II fIush.

19:04.576 --> 19:06.703
You know, I wonder
what Dee Dee is doing, man.

19:06.778 --> 19:08.336
She's dancing.

19:08.647 --> 19:12.481
-What? How do you know that?
-Because she's right over there.

19:14.586 --> 19:16.247
Hey, wait a minute.

19:16.321 --> 19:19.984
She's supposed to be at home
not returning my phone caIIs.

19:28.467 --> 19:29.798
Excuse me.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.402
Dee Dee, what are you doing here?

19:32.471 --> 19:33.733
And who's this?

19:33.805 --> 19:36.069
I'm dancing. This is Robert.

19:36.408 --> 19:38.740
Robert, this is WiII. We used to hang out.

19:38.810 --> 19:39.868
Hi, WiII.

19:39.945 --> 19:42.846
-I'm gonna go get us some punch.
-Thank you.

19:44.550 --> 19:47.280
Where'd you find him at? Rent-a-sucker?

19:48.420 --> 19:49.944
Look, I'm on a date, WiII.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.991
You know, Iike when a guy
who Iikes a girI asks her out...

19:53.058 --> 19:54.150
and they go somewhere...

19:54.226 --> 19:56.694
and he stiII acts nice to her
when they get there?

19:56.762 --> 19:58.195
You know, I do go on dates.

19:58.263 --> 19:59.821
Look, Dee Dee, I just thought that--

19:59.898 --> 20:03.197
You just thought that 'cause I'm not
a size six, no one wouId ask me out.

20:03.268 --> 20:05.099
WeII, not everyone feeIs Iike that.

20:05.170 --> 20:07.161
I mean that's just your hang-up, isn't it?

20:07.239 --> 20:10.106
Dee Dee, Iisten.
I reaIIy Iike you a Iot, aII right?

20:10.175 --> 20:13.941
You reaIIy Iike being with me
as Iong as no one thinks you're with me.

20:14.012 --> 20:17.573
I mean, I'm sorry,
but that's just not good enough for me.

20:21.787 --> 20:26.121
So that's when we reaIized
that we were the onIy ones in white.

20:26.325 --> 20:28.657
And we just aII wanted to die.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.698
You know what coIor I reaIIy Iike?

20:37.169 --> 20:38.534
Strawberry.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.298
I don't get it.

20:43.542 --> 20:46.067
...and now that Beemer runs Iike a top.

20:46.545 --> 20:49.013
You know, I think that's reaIIy...

20:49.481 --> 20:51.142
ex-straw-dinary

20:53.619 --> 20:55.143
I don't get it.

21:28.353 --> 21:30.048
Wait a minute. HoId it, Dee Dee.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.283
WouId you ever wear white
after Labor Day?

21:32.357 --> 21:36.487
If I can button it, and it's cIean,
I'II pretty much wear anything.

21:36.762 --> 21:38.389
My kind of honey.

21:49.708 --> 21:51.232
You know, Dee Dee...

21:51.310 --> 21:54.404
I never thought I'd have you in bed
on the first night.

21:54.479 --> 21:58.677
WeII, I can honestIy say
this is the first time I've ever done this.

21:59.184 --> 22:01.652
<i>This clever device is probably....</i>

22:02.187 --> 22:05.554
I can't beIieve we didn't get in
on that abdominizer.

22:06.291 --> 22:09.351
WeII, that's because you couIdn't decide
between the chocoIate gaveI...

22:09.428 --> 22:12.192
and the picture of the dogs pIaying poker.

22:12.264 --> 22:14.164
WiII you two be quiet?

22:14.666 --> 22:17.601
I'm trying to hear the musicaI toiIet seat.

22:19.571 --> 22:22.335
It's 12:01 . Thank God this day is over.

22:22.441 --> 22:24.272
I Iook Iike I escaped from the '70s.

22:24.343 --> 22:27.870
I've spent the whoIe night with two guys
who consider picking their faces a hobby...

22:27.946 --> 22:30.073
and I got a fIat tire on the way home.

22:30.148 --> 22:33.379
I just want to sit down
and pretend this never happened...

22:33.485 --> 22:37.182
and if one more thing happens to me,
I'm gonna kiII myseIf.

22:42.961 --> 22:45.691
Other than that, man, I mean, I Iike her.

22:48.934 --> 22:50.902
Besides, I've aIready asked out CIaudia.

22:50.969 --> 22:52.630
-Too Iate.
-Damn.

22:52.704 --> 22:56.401
I can't beIieve we got Lakers teats,
center court fIoor.... Damn!

22:57.876 --> 23:01.835
I wouId prefer an assassin's buIIet
to this kind of Iiving heII.

23:05.884 --> 23:07.215
I'm sorry.

23:07.285 --> 23:09.276
<i>l prefer assassin's bullet</i>
<i>to this kind of hell.</i>

23:10.021 --> 23:11.613
<i>That wasn't funny.</i>

23:11.690 --> 23:12.679
EngIish
