WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:03.002
Do you think

00:03.002 --> 00:05.547
that the people at the airport

00:03.002 --> 00:05.547
that run the stores

00:05.547 --> 00:07.257
have any idea

00:05.547 --> 00:07.257
what the prices are

00:07.257 --> 00:09.468
everyplace else in the world,

00:09.468 --> 00:10.928
or do you think they just feel

00:10.928 --> 00:12.888
they have their own

00:10.928 --> 00:12.888
little country there

00:12.888 --> 00:14.849
and they can charge

00:12.888 --> 00:14.849
anything they want?

00:14.849 --> 00:17.225
"You hungry?

00:14.849 --> 00:17.225
Tuna sandwich is $9.00.

00:17.225 --> 00:18.811
"You don't like it,

00:18.811 --> 00:20.437
go back to your own country."

00:20.437 --> 00:22.982
I think the whole

00:20.437 --> 00:22.982
airport/airline complex

00:22.982 --> 00:24.775
is a huge scam

00:24.775 --> 00:26.527
just to sell

00:24.775 --> 00:26.527
the tuna sandwiches.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.069
I think that profit

00:28.069 --> 00:31.072
is what's supporting

00:28.069 --> 00:31.072
the whole air travel industry.

00:31.072 --> 00:32.574
I mean, think about it.

00:32.574 --> 00:34.075
The terminals, the airplanes.

00:34.075 --> 00:35.619
It's all just a distraction

00:35.619 --> 00:38.079
so you don't notice

00:35.619 --> 00:38.079
the beating you're taking

00:38.079 --> 00:39.414
on the tuna.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.839
It's all departures.

00:46.839 --> 00:48.382
I see nothing but departures.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.384
Do you know

00:48.382 --> 00:50.384
where the arrivals are?

00:53.178 --> 00:55.222
Uh, excuse me, sir.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.222
Do you have the time?

00:55.222 --> 00:57.892
There's a clock over there.

00:57.892 --> 00:59.434
Where?

00:59.434 --> 01:01.269
Over there.

01:01.269 --> 01:02.563
But you have

01:01.269 --> 01:02.563
a watch on.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.357
It's right by the escalator.

01:05.357 --> 01:07.442
Why don't you just

01:05.357 --> 01:07.442
look at your watch?

01:07.442 --> 01:11.572
I told you,

01:07.442 --> 01:11.572
it's right over there.

01:11.572 --> 01:12.740
Let me see the watch.

01:12.740 --> 01:13.949
Hey!

01:13.949 --> 01:15.576
What are you,

01:13.949 --> 01:15.576
some kind of nut?

01:15.576 --> 01:21.331
You know,

01:15.576 --> 01:21.331
we're living in a society!

01:21.331 --> 01:22.666
George.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.919
Jerry, Jerry.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.919
Sorry. The flight was delayed.

01:24.919 --> 01:26.169
How long have you

01:24.919 --> 01:26.169
been waiting?

01:26.169 --> 01:27.421
I just got here.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.130
My car broke down

01:27.421 --> 01:29.130
on the Belt Parkway.

01:29.130 --> 01:31.759
Can't believe-- Why don't you

01:29.130 --> 01:31.759
get rid of that junk?

01:31.759 --> 01:34.428
One mile from the exit,

01:31.759 --> 01:34.428
it starts violently shaking,

01:34.428 --> 01:36.304
like it's having

01:34.428 --> 01:36.304
a nervous breakdown,

01:36.304 --> 01:37.890
then it completely stopped dead.

01:37.890 --> 01:39.474
So you have no car.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.559
No.

01:40.559 --> 01:41.977
So, what good are you?

01:43.938 --> 01:45.313
I'll tell you one thing.

01:45.313 --> 01:46.690
This chauffeur's gonna

01:45.313 --> 01:46.690
wait a while.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.734
O'Brien's not showing up.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.734
How do you know?

01:48.734 --> 01:51.111
He was in Chicago.

01:48.734 --> 01:51.111
The flight was overbooked.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.947
They wouldn't let him

01:51.111 --> 01:52.947
on the plane.

01:52.947 --> 01:55.991
He kept screaming how he had

01:52.947 --> 01:55.991
to get to Madison Square Garden.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.452
We should take his limo.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.452
Yeah, right.

02:01.371 --> 02:02.790
Wait a second.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.165
Think about it.

02:04.165 --> 02:06.251
He's not showing up.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.045
Wait'll you see

02:06.251 --> 02:08.045
the line for cabs.

02:08.045 --> 02:09.838
It's, like,

02:08.045 --> 02:09.838
45 minutes long.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.298
You said

02:09.838 --> 02:11.298
he's in Chicago.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.925
He's definitely in Chicago.

02:12.925 --> 02:16.428
Well, that guy

02:12.925 --> 02:16.428
is just standing there.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.306
How would we do it?

02:19.306 --> 02:21.349
We go up to him,

02:19.306 --> 02:21.349
say, "We're O'Brien."

02:22.601 --> 02:24.144
Maybe he knows O'Brien.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.562
No, he doesn't know

02:24.144 --> 02:25.562
O'Brien.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.482
If he knew O'Brien,

02:25.562 --> 02:28.482
he wouldn't have a sign.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.109
Let's just do it.

02:30.109 --> 02:31.359
What if we get caught?

02:31.359 --> 02:32.527
What's going to happen?

02:32.527 --> 02:35.114
They can't kill us.

02:35.114 --> 02:36.448
Who's gonna be O'Brien?

02:36.448 --> 02:38.617
I'll be O'Brien.

02:38.617 --> 02:40.160
Who am I?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.829
You're you.

02:41.829 --> 02:42.788
Just me?

02:42.788 --> 02:43.789
Yeah.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.540
Okay.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.167
What, you don't want

02:45.540 --> 02:47.167
to be you?

02:47.167 --> 02:48.669
If you're

02:47.167 --> 02:48.669
gonna be O'Brien,

02:48.669 --> 02:50.462
why can't I be somebody?

02:51.630 --> 02:52.965
Like who?

02:52.965 --> 02:54.842
Dylan Murphy.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.302
Okay.

02:57.302 --> 03:00.472
What, now you want

02:57.302 --> 03:00.472
to be Dylan Murphy?

03:00.472 --> 03:01.890
Well, I like Dylan.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.517
You could be Colin.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.060
Okay. Colin O'Brien.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.729
I'm Dylan Murphy.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.729
I'm Colin O'Brien.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.732
Are we really doing this?

03:10.732 --> 03:11.942
Come on.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.318
Hey, do you have

03:11.942 --> 03:13.318
the time?

03:13.318 --> 03:15.154
Clock over there.

03:15.154 --> 03:16.613
O'Brien.

03:16.613 --> 03:17.739
Yes, sir.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.825
Sorry we're, uh...

03:17.739 --> 03:19.825
we're late.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.200
Here, let me take that.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.410
Oh, thank you.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.410
Uh...

03:22.410 --> 03:24.579
I'll get the car

03:22.410 --> 03:24.579
and bring it around.

03:24.579 --> 03:26.123
Thank you very much.

03:26.123 --> 03:27.248
Dylan.

03:27.248 --> 03:29.668
Colin.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.380
Can you believe this?

03:33.380 --> 03:34.882
This is incredible.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.508
This is one of

03:34.882 --> 03:36.508
the greatest things

03:36.508 --> 03:37.926
I've ever done

03:36.508 --> 03:37.926
in my life.

03:37.926 --> 03:40.512
I'm going to call

03:37.926 --> 03:40.512
my mother.

03:37.926 --> 03:40.512
What for?

03:40.512 --> 03:42.430
To tell her

03:40.512 --> 03:42.430
I'm in a limo.

03:44.349 --> 03:45.642
Hello, Ma?

03:45.642 --> 03:46.810
It's me.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.228
Guess where I am.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.105
In the back of a limo.

03:50.105 --> 03:51.857
No, nobody died.

03:51.857 --> 03:53.817
It's a long story.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.527
I can't tell you now.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.029
Because I can't.

03:57.029 --> 03:58.739
I said I can't.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.700
If I could, I would.

04:01.700 --> 04:04.036
Would you stop it?

04:04.036 --> 04:05.204
All right, look--

04:05.204 --> 04:06.705
I'm-- I'm getting off.

04:06.705 --> 04:07.873
No, I'm not telling you.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.791
How's this?

04:07.873 --> 04:09.791
I'm never telling you.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.043
I don't care. No!

04:11.043 --> 04:13.378
Fine! Never!

04:16.090 --> 04:17.674
She happy for you?

04:19.718 --> 04:21.344
Can he hear us?

04:21.344 --> 04:22.387
Mm-mm.

04:22.387 --> 04:23.555
Why?

04:23.555 --> 04:24.806
Thought I saw him

04:24.806 --> 04:26.474
look in the mirror

04:24.806 --> 04:26.474
suspiciously.

04:26.474 --> 04:27.809
He can't hear us.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.270
Let's test him.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.231
Hey, driver!

04:32.231 --> 04:33.941
What do you say

04:32.231 --> 04:33.941
we, uh, stop off,

04:33.941 --> 04:34.900
pick up your sister,

04:34.900 --> 04:36.985
have a little fun

04:34.900 --> 04:36.985
back here?

04:39.071 --> 04:40.864
No. He can't hear us.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.032
Where's he dropping us?

04:42.032 --> 04:43.658
Maybe we can get him

04:42.032 --> 04:43.658
to drop us

04:43.658 --> 04:44.618
right at my house.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.327
I'll ask him.

04:48.705 --> 04:49.873
Uh, my dear fellow,

04:49.873 --> 04:51.332
where are you

04:49.873 --> 04:51.332
dropping us?

04:51.332 --> 04:53.127
Madison Square Garden,

04:51.332 --> 04:53.127
of course.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.253
I have the four passes.

04:54.253 --> 04:55.336
Of course.

04:55.336 --> 04:57.547
The, uh...

04:55.336 --> 04:57.547
the four passes.

04:59.925 --> 05:03.262
Four passes? Four passes

04:59.925 --> 05:03.262
to Madison Square Garden?

05:03.262 --> 05:05.139
Wait a minute.

05:05.139 --> 05:06.932
Wait a minute.

05:05.139 --> 05:06.932
Of course.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.391
Chicago.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.894
The Knicks are playing

05:08.391 --> 05:10.894
the Bulls tonight.

05:10.894 --> 05:11.979
What?

05:11.979 --> 05:13.772
We are going

05:11.979 --> 05:13.772
to the Knick game!

05:13.772 --> 05:15.274
Michael Jordan!

05:13.772 --> 05:15.274
The Knicks!

05:15.274 --> 05:17.567
We're going

05:15.274 --> 05:17.567
to the Knick game!

05:17.567 --> 05:18.693
Four free passes!

05:18.693 --> 05:20.403
Did I tell you?

05:20.403 --> 05:22.239
I can't believe it!

05:22.239 --> 05:24.658
You may have hit with this one!

05:22.239 --> 05:24.658
Oh, you see?

05:24.658 --> 05:25.993
You see?

05:25.993 --> 05:28.536
I see things as they are,

05:25.993 --> 05:28.536
and I say, "No."

05:28.536 --> 05:29.871
Uh, wait.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.706
Uh, you see things

05:29.871 --> 05:31.706
as they are not,

05:31.706 --> 05:33.333
and you say--

05:33.333 --> 05:36.003
Wait. Uh...

05:33.333 --> 05:36.003
You see thi--

05:36.003 --> 05:37.420
You see things

05:36.003 --> 05:37.420
as they are?

05:37.420 --> 05:39.298
What do you say

05:37.420 --> 05:39.298
when you see things?

05:39.298 --> 05:41.382
Let me call

05:39.298 --> 05:41.382
Elaine and Kramer.

05:41.382 --> 05:43.177
If I see things

05:41.382 --> 05:43.177
as they are,

05:43.177 --> 05:46.180
I would ask,

05:43.177 --> 05:46.180
"Why?" or "Why not?"

05:46.180 --> 05:48.389
Elaine?

05:48.389 --> 05:49.724
It's me.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.101
What are you doing

05:49.724 --> 05:51.101
tonight?

05:51.101 --> 05:52.144
Great.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.687
George and I

05:52.144 --> 05:53.687
have tickets--

05:53.687 --> 05:55.189
Four free passes

05:55.189 --> 05:57.691
to the Knicks-Bulls game

05:55.189 --> 05:57.691
at Madison Square Garden.

05:57.691 --> 05:58.859
Aah!

05:57.691 --> 05:58.859
Lah-dee!

05:58.859 --> 06:01.111
Can you go?

06:01.111 --> 06:02.445
Great.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.445
Listen, call Kramer.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.698
Tell him to meet us

06:02.445 --> 06:04.698
on the corner at 7:00.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.200
All right.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.076
We're going to

06:06.200 --> 06:08.076
pick you up in a limo.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.620
That's right, baby doll.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.247
And listen,

06:10.620 --> 06:12.247
when we pick you up,

06:12.247 --> 06:14.249
I'm Murphy,

06:12.247 --> 06:14.249
and George is O'Brien.

06:14.249 --> 06:16.335
I can't tell you now.

06:16.335 --> 06:17.878
It's a long story.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.378
I am serious.

06:19.378 --> 06:20.797
