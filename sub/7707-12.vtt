00:08.442 --> 00:09.842
What are you guys doing?

00:09.844 --> 00:12.611
It's a magic trick
we just saw on TV.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.780
It's called
"The Two-Layer Pineapple

00:14.782 --> 00:17.383
Surprise Cake
In A Sun Hat" trick.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.352
With mom's sun hat?

00:21.288 --> 00:22.888
We couldn't find Willie's.

00:24.225 --> 00:29.495
And now, without further ado,
a pinch of yeast

00:29.497 --> 00:32.064
and two eggs.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.532
One, two.

00:35.403 --> 00:39.071
Does mom know you're
using her sun hat?

00:39.073 --> 00:41.273
Silence, please!

00:41.275 --> 00:43.675
Will the young man with
the freckles and the overbite

00:43.677 --> 00:45.644
please mix the ingredients.

00:46.614 --> 00:48.047
She doesn't know, does she?

00:48.049 --> 00:50.582
I'm running this trick
on a need-to-know basis.

00:54.155 --> 00:56.722
- Is it done?
- Perfect!

00:56.724 --> 00:58.557
Now cover the hat
with the plate

02:42.263 --> 02:43.829
It was Kate's idea.

02:43.831 --> 02:46.632
I have to write
this 100 times.

02:46.634 --> 02:49.368
On the refrigerator?

02:49.370 --> 02:50.636
She didn't say.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.973
Allow me to present
an alternative

02:54.975 --> 02:59.311
to writing on
the major appliances.

02:59.313 --> 03:00.712
What's that?

03:00.714 --> 03:01.980
It's a magic kit.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.249
I thought I'd introduce you

03:04.251 --> 03:06.518
to some less messy tricks.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.554
What do you know about magic?

03:08.556 --> 03:11.256
I dabbled a little
when I was your age.

03:11.258 --> 03:12.925
Uh.. Your height.

03:14.061 --> 03:17.095
Really? Oh! Oh!
Show me! Show me!

03:17.097 --> 03:19.298
Well.. Yeah.

03:19.300 --> 03:22.201

03:38.586 --> 03:41.286
I'm gonna tell you
what that card is.

03:41.288 --> 03:43.088
I know what the card is.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.723
It's the nine of clubs.

Any card. This time don't
tell me what it is.

Why?

03:58.339 --> 04:01.073
'Any...card.'

There. Happy?

04:10.217 --> 04:11.917
Okay.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.953
Now you take
a good look at that card

04:14.955 --> 04:17.055
and then put it
back in the pack.

04:24.298 --> 04:25.330

04:31.872 --> 04:34.740
Alright, now,
I'm going to concentrate

04:34.742 --> 04:37.075
on your thoughts.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.678
Uh..

04:41.515 --> 04:43.749

are connecting..

Ha! Aha!

04:56.730 --> 04:57.996
Is that your card?

Beats me.

These cards are marked.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.578
Well, you cheated!

05:13.580 --> 05:15.314
I didn't cheat.

05:15.316 --> 05:16.615
You cheated, you lied

05:16.617 --> 05:18.283
you said that you loved me.

05:19.887 --> 05:22.120
It's not cheating.

05:22.122 --> 05:24.022
It's part of the trick. Watch.

Wow! How did you do that?

What magic have we to look
forward to tonight, Stupe?

06:30.324 --> 06:31.656
Picture, if you will

06:31.658 --> 06:34.292
an ordinary flowerpot.

06:34.294 --> 06:36.528
Empty to the human eye.

06:36.530 --> 06:39.631
But one tap with
my magic wand

06:39.633 --> 06:41.433
and the flowerpot becomes..

06:44.805 --> 06:47.472
...big jaggedy pieces of clay.

06:47.474 --> 06:48.840
Ta-da!

take care of it later.

How long does a guy have to toil
in kiddie tricks?

14:27.868 --> 14:30.568
Maybe until he completes
one or two of them successfully.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.605
Maybe he doesn't
stand a chance

14:33.607 --> 14:36.808
when all the diagrams favored
five-fingered magicians.

14:36.810 --> 14:39.978
Maybe he's gotten into something
a little over his head.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.512
Maybe at three foot two

14:41.514 --> 14:43.982
everything he gets
into<i> is</i> over his head.

14:45.252 --> 14:49.988
Oh, ALF, enough is enough.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.823
But I was just getting started.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.528
Yo, right here.

14:58.665 --> 15:01.366
ALF, I'm gonna say
in terms so simple

15:01.368 --> 15:04.869
that even you cannot
possibly misunderstand.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.539
Huh?

15:08.541 --> 15:11.943
Learning magic requires
diligence and patience.

15:11.945 --> 15:15.513
Two qualities which you've
not as yet demonstrated.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.717
Face it, ALF.

15:19.719 --> 15:22.887
You just don't have
the talent for magic.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.556
Sure.

15:25.558 --> 15:28.293
Kick the prestidigitator
when he's down.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.172
Hey, two and three..

15:41.174 --> 15:43.708
...could you at least wait
until the lights are out.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.880
Hey, ALF, I found
your magic sign in the trash.

15:48.882 --> 15:51.182
Right next to my career.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.418
You're not gonna
give up, are you?

15:53.420 --> 15:56.254
The magic wand's retired, B.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.588
Unlike Billy Martin..

15:57.590 --> 16:00.124
...I know when to hang it up.

16:00.126 --> 16:03.628
But you promised I could
be in one of your tricks.

16:03.630 --> 16:06.397
I guess I'll have
to make it up to you.

16:06.399 --> 16:07.932
Okay then.

16:07.934 --> 16:11.436
Make it up to me
by making me disappear.

16:11.438 --> 16:14.405
No, I don't feel like it.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.407
Oh, come on, ALF, please?

16:19.012 --> 16:20.812
Alright, get in the box.

16:23.550 --> 16:26.217
Okay, remember how
we saw it on TV?

16:26.219 --> 16:27.685
You close the curtain

16:27.687 --> 16:30.321
and you spin the box
around three times.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.923
Ixnay on the spinning.

16:31.925 --> 16:33.491
If you puke in that box

16:33.493 --> 16:35.360
it can't be returned.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.100
You alright in there?

16:42.102 --> 16:43.735
It's alright!

16:43.737 --> 16:45.737
Thank you, Junior Wences.

16:46.606 --> 16:49.307
I'll say the magic words..

16:49.309 --> 16:52.276
Alakazoo, alakazam.

16:52.278 --> 16:54.912
I'll show you what a hack I am.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.285
Brian?

17:01.287 --> 17:03.087
Yo, B, you in there?

17:05.825 --> 17:07.158
Yes!

17:07.160 --> 17:08.359
Yes!

17:08.361 --> 17:10.395
I came, I saw

17:10.397 --> 17:12.530
I demolecularized.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.566
I can do magic!

17:15.568 --> 17:17.835
Uh-oh, now I'll make
you reappear, B.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.537
Um..

17:19.539 --> 17:22.807
Uh, abracadabra, alakazam..

17:22.809 --> 17:25.910
...I'm a better magician
than I thought I am!

17:29.883 --> 17:31.182
Uh-oh.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.917
A glitch in the finale.

17:36.089 --> 17:37.789
Uh, alakazam.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.993
Oh, no.

17:41.995 --> 17:45.897
Uh, I vaporized the boy.

17:45.899 --> 17:47.899
Kate and Willie
will not be pleased.

17:49.202 --> 17:52.603
Especially since Willie told me
not to do any more tricks.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.474
Oh, wait a minute.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.910
I smell a conspiracy here.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.947
[sniffing]

18:02.949 --> 18:06.717
I also smell eight rabbits
cooped up in a garage.

18:06.719 --> 18:07.852
Yuck!

18:07.854 --> 18:08.986
Phew!

18:10.123 --> 18:12.156
Okay, where is he?

18:12.158 --> 18:13.524
Where's who?

18:13.526 --> 18:15.193
Your little stooge.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.161
Is he hiding under the sink?

18:17.163 --> 18:19.130
Okay, Brian! Come on out!

18:19.132 --> 18:21.566
Simon says!

18:21.568 --> 18:23.267
You know what
he's talking about?

18:23.269 --> 18:25.903
Hardly ever.

18:25.905 --> 18:28.806
You really don't know what
I'm talking about, do you?

18:28.808 --> 18:30.475
N-no.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.543
Uh..

18:32.545 --> 18:36.347
Simon says, everyone
take one giant step

18:36.349 --> 18:38.015
out to the garage.

18:40.186 --> 18:41.986
[instrumental music]

18:44.691 --> 18:47.225
Then I said some
more magic words

18:47.227 --> 18:50.228
but when I opened the box
Brian was gone!

18:51.598 --> 18:54.532
Well, not gone exactly.

18:54.534 --> 18:57.001
Just smaller and fond of salad.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.705
Oh, wait. Here.. Here we go!

19:00.707 --> 19:02.974
I knew there had to be
a secret compartment somewh..

19:05.378 --> 19:06.811
Brian's not here.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.981
Don't deny your son's existence

19:09.983 --> 19:12.650
just because he's a little
different from the rest of us.

19:15.121 --> 19:16.888
ALF, don't be ridiculous.

19:16.890 --> 19:18.789
He is being ridiculous,
isn't he, Willie?

19:18.791 --> 19:20.591
Oh, of course he's
being ridiculous.

19:20.593 --> 19:23.995
It's not possible
to turn people into rabbits.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.197
Even with magic?

19:26.199 --> 19:28.533
It isn't magic, ALF.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.568
It's a trick!

19:30.570 --> 19:32.570
That's your theory.

19:33.806 --> 19:34.906
Honey, he must be
in the house somewhere.

19:34.908 --> 19:36.674
Come on, let's go look for him.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.811
Don't worry, Brian.

19:40.813 --> 19:43.014
You'll get used to
the big ear jokes.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.284
Well, thank you, Mrs. Beckham.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.953
If Brian does show up, will
you send him home, please?

19:48.955 --> 19:51.155
Okay. Thanks so much.
Bye-bye.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.258
- Not there, either.
- Unh-unh.

19:54.260 --> 19:56.761
Honey, I-I don't know
who else to call.

19:56.763 --> 19:59.130
I'm sure Brian's fine.

19:59.132 --> 20:01.799
He-he wouldn't just run off
without letting us know.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.669
[sighs]

20:04.671 --> 20:06.804
Hey, Kate, you got
any carrots left?

20:06.806 --> 20:09.840
Your son looks hungry.

20:09.842 --> 20:12.443
ALF, did you get that
cage from Brian's room?

20:12.445 --> 20:13.678
That's right.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.513
What did you do with the snake?

20:15.515 --> 20:17.982
What are you so worried
about the snake for?

20:17.984 --> 20:20.952
We're talking about your
own fur and blood here!

20:22.889 --> 20:24.789
Kate, when you checked
in Brian's room

20:24.791 --> 20:26.557
did you look under the bed?

20:26.559 --> 20:27.925
N-no.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.727
Well, I'm sure he's under there

20:29.729 --> 20:31.762
playing cave dwellers again.

20:33.099 --> 20:34.832
Watch out for the snake!

20:34.834 --> 20:37.168
He was pretty mad
when I dumped him out.

20:41.307 --> 20:43.107
Brian?

20:43.109 --> 20:44.842
Brian?

20:44.844 --> 20:47.445
Do you understand me?

20:47.447 --> 20:49.080
Um..

20:49.082 --> 20:51.215
Hop once for yes

20:51.217 --> 20:52.350
twice for no.

20:56.522 --> 20:57.755
Hi, ALF.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.190
How did you do that?

20:59.192 --> 21:01.192
You didn't even move
your little rabbit lips.

21:02.996 --> 21:04.895
Rabbit lips?

21:04.897 --> 21:07.531
Brian, you're not a rabbit!

21:07.533 --> 21:08.733
[door opens]

21:08.735 --> 21:10.701
Oh, Brian!

21:10.703 --> 21:13.204
- Hi, dad.
- Where have you been?

21:13.206 --> 21:16.307
I was hiding in the car.
But I got hungry.

21:16.309 --> 21:18.709
Why were you hiding in the car?

21:18.711 --> 21:21.112
I wanted ALF to think
he made me disappear

21:21.114 --> 21:23.581
so he wouldn't think
he's a bad magician.

21:23.583 --> 21:26.250
Oh! Oh, honey.

21:26.252 --> 21:28.252
It was nice of you not
to want ALF to feel bad

21:28.254 --> 21:30.988
but we were very,
very worried about you.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.189
Yeah!

21:32.191 --> 21:35.092
I thought I turned
you into a rabbit.

21:35.094 --> 21:37.094
Sorry, mom, dad.

21:39.032 --> 21:40.264
Sorry, ALF.

21:40.266 --> 21:42.266
I guess I messed up the trick.

21:42.268 --> 21:44.068
That's okay, Bri.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.270
Now you can clean up
your own pellets.

21:49.008 --> 21:53.778
A very large snake
just slithered into my gym bag.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.212
Somebody please do something.

21:55.214 --> 21:57.481
You better not have
scared Captain Eo.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.684
Go.

22:03.589 --> 22:04.989
As soon as we're finished here

22:04.991 --> 22:07.525
we're gonna pack up
all the rabbits

22:07.527 --> 22:08.893
and all the magic boxes

22:08.895 --> 22:10.194
and we're gonna send them back

22:10.196 --> 22:12.196
whence they came, right?

22:12.198 --> 22:14.198
Right.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.835
[instrumental music]

22:26.479 --> 22:31.482
Oh, ALF. You didn't have to
bring us breakfast in bed.

22:31.484 --> 22:33.150
It was the least I could do

22:33.152 --> 22:37.355
after I almost misplaced
your son and everything.

22:37.357 --> 22:41.158
Say, I'm sorry the magic
thing didn't work out.

22:41.160 --> 22:44.128
That's okay.
I've thought about it

22:44.130 --> 22:46.764
and I believe
my true calling in life

22:46.766 --> 22:50.468
is to build
powerful fireworks displays.

22:52.905 --> 22:54.739
If you need me,
I'll be on the phone

22:54.741 --> 22:57.074
with
Buckley's House of Gunpowder.
