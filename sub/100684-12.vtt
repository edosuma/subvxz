00:02.043 --> 00:04.671
You promised me drugs.
Where are my drugs?

00:06.548 --> 00:07.674
Josiah?

00:07.716 --> 00:10.593
Hello, s-sir. Um...

00:10.635 --> 00:11.970
JOSIAH:
Told me you were gonna

00:12.012 --> 00:14.347
get everything out.
I had men waiting.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.766
You never showed.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.476
Please explain.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.278
We don't have them.

00:28.319 --> 00:30.030
You don't have them?

00:30.071 --> 00:32.532
The police were watching us.

00:32.574 --> 00:34.200
So we had to move
all of the drugs,

00:34.242 --> 00:36.911
but the associate
we gave them to,

00:36.953 --> 00:38.955
well, um, he-he
sort of hid them.

00:38.997 --> 00:42.333
And this associate...
where is he now?

00:42.375 --> 00:45.170
He's dead.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.921
Dead?

00:47.922 --> 00:49.966
And I take it
he didn't tell you

00:50.008 --> 00:52.969
where he hid them
before he died?

00:53.011 --> 00:55.305
That is some bad luck.
<b></b>
FELIX: Look-look,

00:55.346 --> 00:57.599
Nia doesn't have the
drugs anymore, either,

00:57.640 --> 00:59.350
so that's
good for you.

00:59.392 --> 01:01.352
Good would be to have
the shipment that

01:01.394 --> 01:03.063
you promised me.
<b></b>
FELIX: Yeah, but

01:03.104 --> 01:05.648
the whole point was to take
everything away from Nia.

01:05.690 --> 01:08.610
And believe me... we did.

01:08.651 --> 01:11.321
supply.

01:12.864 --> 01:15.200
And now that supply
is missing.

01:19.329 --> 01:23.500
Find it,
or I'll have you all killed.

01:23.541 --> 01:26.503
Go to the cops,
I'll have you killed.

01:26.544 --> 01:29.214
Tell anyone, try to run...

01:29.255 --> 01:33.093
well... you get it.

01:33.134 --> 01:36.387
Yeah. We get
it. Got it.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.264
You have until midnight.

01:45.271 --> 01:46.689

01:46.731 --> 01:48.691
(quietly): Okay.

02:17.887 --> 02:20.306

Where did you hide them?

02:46.166 --> 02:47.834
FELIX:
What are we gonna do?

02:47.876 --> 02:50.003
We obviously need to figure out
where Ben hid the drugs.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.796
Okay, well, that...
that could be anywhere.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.840
It's Ben, though,
so it can't be that hard.

02:53.882 --> 02:56.384
Come on, what do we
know about him?

02:56.426 --> 02:57.844
He's an addict.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.388
He's a... yeah.
<b></b>
Yes. What else?

03:00.430 --> 03:04.267
He likes to play games
on his phone.

03:06.936 --> 03:09.939
He's Chelsea's brother.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.107
Oh, my God. Um...

03:11.149 --> 03:13.067
What? Who?

03:13.109 --> 03:14.736
Chelsea.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.113
Why are you
looking at me?

03:17.155 --> 03:19.991
No. Absolutely not.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.285
MURPHY: She might know where
he likes to hang out.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.286
She might know
who his friends are.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.370
We obviously don't.

03:24.412 --> 03:25.830
I haven't spoken
to Chelsea

03:25.872 --> 03:26.581
since I ghosted her.

03:26.623 --> 03:30.460
I'm not about to go trick her
into giving me information

03:30.501 --> 03:32.712
on her dead brother, who
she doesn't even know is dead.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.005
No.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.216
I know that it seems horrible.

03:36.257 --> 03:38.509
horrible.
It is horrible.

Felix.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.428
This all needs to end.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.263
And the only way
it's gonna end is if

03:42.305 --> 03:44.474
we find those stupid drugs.

03:44.515 --> 03:46.476
Please, Felix.

I'm a little better.
You're where?

Oh.

Get in my room.

Uh, I'm not sure, I mean,

I'm still, like, pretty gross.

04:11.292 --> 04:12.502

04:12.543 --> 04:15.213
Take off your jacket.

Okay. Bye.

Murphy, you need
to get rid of him.
I know!

04:17.757 --> 04:19.759
I know.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.595
Murphy?

04:23.721 --> 04:25.223
Hi.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.307
You know, your lock is broken.

04:26.349 --> 04:27.684
Yeah. (chuckles)

04:27.725 --> 04:29.602
Oh, my God, what, what happened?

04:29.644 --> 04:31.020
Oh, uh...

04:31.062 --> 04:33.731
uh, I, my-- I just
slipped on some ice.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.608
It's nothing.
Yeah, well, it
doesn't look like nothing.

04:35.650 --> 04:36.734
I'm okay.

04:36.776 --> 04:37.902
And you got dirt
all over you.

04:37.944 --> 04:38.987
You're a mess.

04:39.028 --> 04:40.280
When did this happen?

04:40.321 --> 04:41.489
Uh... earlier,

04:41.531 --> 04:43.283
but I just...

04:43.324 --> 04:46.035
forgot to change.

04:46.077 --> 04:47.078
Does it hurt?

04:47.120 --> 04:48.871
No, not anymore.

04:48.913 --> 04:50.707
You poor thing,
well...

04:50.748 --> 04:51.833
And-and your stomach?

04:51.874 --> 04:53.209
Still a little weird.

04:53.251 --> 04:55.336
Well, I brought ginger tea
and biscuits.

04:56.587 --> 04:57.964
He's got an accent.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.590
That's the only reason
why she likes him.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.175
I actually think it's because
he's losing his sight, too.

05:01.217 --> 05:03.511
They connected
on a super deep level.

05:03.553 --> 05:04.887
JOSH:
You're good?

05:04.929 --> 05:06.514
MURPHY: Yeah, it is
really sweet, but

05:06.556 --> 05:08.182
you can just leave it.

05:08.224 --> 05:10.184
Tea is one of the few things
I actually know how to make.

05:10.226 --> 05:11.352
Yeah?

05:11.394 --> 05:12.687
(chuckles) Me, too.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.480

05:14.522 --> 05:16.065
At least
let me stay

Okay.

Thanks, Jess.

12 hours and we can't
spend one of them here.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.248
What?

05:32.290 --> 05:33.916
I didn't say anything.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.586
I can feel you staring at me.

05:36.627 --> 05:38.629
So what is it?

05:39.797 --> 05:42.258
You're just...

05:42.300 --> 05:44.427
very pretty.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.637
Even all banged up.

Hi.

Hello, Jess. Sorry, I
didn't know you were in.

06:02.278 --> 06:04.697
Murphy, are you feeling okay?
She's not feel--

06:04.739 --> 06:06.407
She's kind of
not feeling good...

06:06.449 --> 06:09.077
Yeah, he was gonna make me...
some tea.

06:09.118 --> 06:10.453
Oh, that's so nice.

06:10.495 --> 06:11.954
But you know what,
I can take it from here.

06:11.996 --> 06:14.165
Oh, all right, yeah.
JESS:
Yeah.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.584
I guess I should be getting
back to work anyway.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.878
Yeah.
Okay.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.963
Call me when you're
back on your feet.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.094

06:26.135 --> 06:28.054
I thought I told you
to get rid of him.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.222
Oh, I was.
Yeah, okay.

06:30.264 --> 06:31.766
That's what that
looked like.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.017

06:47.198 --> 06:48.741
FELIX:
Is there not

06:48.783 --> 06:51.285
just some other way
we can get information on Ben?

06:51.327 --> 06:53.037
What about his phone?
We could, we could find out

06:53.079 --> 06:54.622
where he was last night
by looking at his texts,

06:54.664 --> 06:56.499
geo-tagged photos...
JESS:
Wait.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.251
You want to go back to the place
where we buried everything?

06:58.292 --> 07:00.169
Not a terrible idea.

Thank you.

07:00.211 --> 07:01.712
MURPHY: Great,
so we'll go

07:01.754 --> 07:02.922
while Felix talks to Chelsea.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.090
FELIX:
I thought my suggestion

07:04.132 --> 07:05.341
cancelled out the Chelsea plan.

07:05.383 --> 07:06.342
No, it did not.

07:06.384 --> 07:07.844
Now, Jess,
I'm sorry,

07:07.885 --> 07:09.303
but we have to talk about
Sterling for a second.

07:09.345 --> 07:10.763
Are we supposed
to just

07:10.805 --> 07:12.682
somehow believe that she's

07:12.723 --> 07:14.142
gonna magically convince

07:14.183 --> 07:16.185
Vincent and Sam
not to murder us?

07:16.227 --> 07:17.395
Yeah.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.272
I know
that sounds crazy

07:19.313 --> 07:21.023
considering
everything

07:21.065 --> 07:24.277
she did to me, but I...

07:24.318 --> 07:27.029
know that she'll do
whatever it takes

07:27.071 --> 07:28.781
to make sure that I'm...

07:28.823 --> 07:32.743
safe.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.162
MILLER:
So...

07:34.203 --> 07:36.247
you're here
to report a murder?

07:36.289 --> 07:37.707
Yeah.

07:37.748 --> 07:39.750
And the name
of the victim?

07:39.792 --> 07:41.377
I don't...

07:41.419 --> 07:43.254
uh, I don't really
know her name.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.590
Well, that doesn't
help me much.

07:47.049 --> 07:49.302
I can tell you
the name of the killer.

07:49.343 --> 07:51.387
It's Samantha Rogers.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.389
Sam.

07:53.431 --> 07:55.558
Samantha
Rogers?

07:55.600 --> 07:57.185
And where did this murder
take place?

07:57.226 --> 08:00.354
In the victim's apartment
on South Hermitage.

08:00.396 --> 08:02.398
I'm pretty sure it was made
to look like a suicide.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.984
Sam knows what she's doing.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.403
And that's usually
how she covers her tracks.

08:07.445 --> 08:10.031
MILLER:
Wait, a suicide
on South Hermitage?

08:10.072 --> 08:11.782
Are you talking
about Jules Becker?

08:11.824 --> 08:13.284
STERLING:
I don't know.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.869
I-I didn't know her name.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.579
Sam didn't tell me
that kind of thing.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.664
I do know that Nia Bailey
ordered the hit.

08:18.706 --> 08:20.166
MILLER:
Nia Bailey?

08:20.208 --> 08:22.293
STERLING:
Yeah, Sam works for her

08:22.335 --> 08:24.754
and handles those
kinds of things.

08:24.795 --> 08:26.380
MILLER:
You're telling me
that Nia Bailey

08:26.422 --> 08:28.382
had a homicide
detective killed?

08:28.424 --> 08:30.384
STERLING:
I didn't know she was a cop.

08:30.426 --> 08:32.595
Like I said, all I know is

08:32.637 --> 08:35.223
that Samantha Rogers did it.

08:35.264 --> 08:37.350
MILLER:
And, how may I ask,
do you know all of this?

08:37.391 --> 08:39.101
(horn honks)

08:39.143 --> 08:41.020
STERLING:
Because...

08:41.062 --> 08:44.232
I waited outside
while she did it.

08:44.273 --> 08:46.734
I was her driver.

08:54.158 --> 08:55.243
You know, if your story
checks out...
<b></b>
It will.

08:55.284 --> 08:57.036
you can be charged with aiding

08:57.078 --> 08:58.621
and abetting.
I know.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.331
So, then, let me
ask you something.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.958
If you two got
away with it,

09:01.999 --> 09:03.668
why are you here?

09:03.709 --> 09:06.420
Because that girl, Sam, she's...

09:06.462 --> 09:08.673
she's about to hurt
a lot more innocent people.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.383
Her and Nia's other lieutenant.

09:10.424 --> 09:11.801
His name is Vincent Davis.

09:11.842 --> 09:14.512
I can give you license
plates, cell phones.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.847
I just want you to arrest them.

09:16.889 --> 09:19.267
Even if it means
that I go down, too.

09:19.308 --> 09:22.103
I'm gonna have a look
at a few things.

09:22.144 --> 09:23.437
All right?

09:23.479 --> 09:24.564
I'll be right back.

09:30.027 --> 09:31.112
(door opens)

09:31.153 --> 09:33.197
(door closes)

09:34.156 --> 09:36.200
(children clamoring nearby)

09:53.593 --> 09:55.970
Chelsea?

09:56.012 --> 09:58.097
Chelsea, let me in.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.099
Please?

10:00.141 --> 10:01.851
I just want to talk, okay?

10:01.892 --> 10:03.060
I'm sorry...

10:03.102 --> 10:05.229
for everything.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.440
Come on.

10:07.481 --> 10:10.234
Fine. Whatever.

10:13.821 --> 10:14.780
Hey.

10:14.822 --> 10:16.073
Hey.

10:17.241 --> 10:18.993
C-Can I, uh...

10:19.035 --> 10:20.411
can I sit down, or...

10:20.453 --> 10:21.871
do you wa...? I mean,
I can stand if you want...

10:21.912 --> 10:23.873
Do you want to just tell me
why you're here?

10:23.914 --> 10:25.458
Yeah. I, um...

10:25.499 --> 10:27.752
Ben didn't show up to work,

10:27.793 --> 10:29.754
and, um, he's not answering

10:29.795 --> 10:31.047
his calls.

10:31.088 --> 10:32.548
I thought I would
just come check on him.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.467
Yeah, of course
you came to check on Ben.

10:34.508 --> 10:35.968
Wow.
<b></b>
I don't know,

10:36.010 --> 10:38.387
I guess I was using Ben
as an excuse

10:38.429 --> 10:40.640
to-to-to come see you.

10:40.681 --> 10:42.099
(takes deep breath)

10:42.141 --> 10:44.018
To say I'm... I'm sorry.

10:45.227 --> 10:47.146
Okay.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.939
Is that all

10:48.981 --> 10:50.232
you want to say?

10:50.274 --> 10:51.776
No. I have a lot

10:51.817 --> 10:54.779
of other things to say... too.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.614
I... I'm just...

10:56.656 --> 10:58.658
figuring out
how to say them.

10:58.699 --> 11:00.493
Okay, well,
I barely slept last night,

11:00.534 --> 11:03.204
and I have to be at work soon,
so I'm gonna make some coffee.

11:03.245 --> 11:04.580
I-I... Can I help?

11:04.622 --> 11:05.873
No.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.251
I'll just be here.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.964
♪ ♪

11:44.245 --> 11:46.288
♪ ♪

11:53.045 --> 11:55.923
Hey, Chloe, I got to head back
into the station. You be okay?

11:55.965 --> 11:57.508
Fine, Dad.
<b></b>
I made you some mac and cheese.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.509
It's on the counter.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.760
Okay?
<b></b>
Tried it.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.262
It's disgusting.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.653
You guys want music?

12:17.695 --> 12:19.280
No.
No.

12:25.953 --> 12:28.414
Do you have any cream?

12:28.456 --> 12:29.957
I'm off dairy.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.293
Good for you.
They say cheese

12:32.334 --> 12:34.920
is as addictive as...
cocaine. (chuckles)

12:36.046 --> 12:37.757
(quietly):
So...

12:37.798 --> 12:40.092
Look, I'm really sorry.
There was no excuse...

12:40.134 --> 12:41.886
for my behavior.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.471
No, there wasn't.

12:43.512 --> 12:45.222
'Cause you
could have just texted me

12:45.264 --> 12:47.558
if you didn't want to see me
anymore, and I'm pretty sure

12:47.600 --> 12:49.518
I would have survived.
<b></b>
I guess
I just felt guilty,

12:49.560 --> 12:53.230
um, about accusing Ben...

12:53.272 --> 12:56.108
of stealing, and I just...

12:56.150 --> 12:57.860
Don't feel guilty about that.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.695
He probably was stealing.

13:01.989 --> 13:03.908
I'm pretty sure
he's using again.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.910
(groans)
That's awful.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.078
I don't know why I
am at all surprised,

13:08.120 --> 13:09.872
'cause this is
what he does.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.332
He disappears for
days at a time,

13:11.373 --> 13:14.335
and then he shows up
out of nowhere,

13:14.376 --> 13:15.878
and he just acts like
you're the crazy one

13:15.920 --> 13:17.588
for freaking out about it.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.590
Do you know where he goes?

13:19.632 --> 13:22.551
I mean,
I could help look for him.

13:22.593 --> 13:25.012
No. He'll turn up
eventually.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.265
But I'm done.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.100
He's not allowed
to stay with me ever again.

13:30.142 --> 13:31.602
He can find somebody else
to enable him.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.603
Yeah.

13:32.645 --> 13:33.979
Stay strong.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.815
Will do.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.528
(exhales):
I... I have to get to work.

13:40.569 --> 13:42.738
Okay. I would offer
to give you a ride,

13:42.780 --> 13:43.739
but I didn't drive.

13:43.781 --> 13:45.366
I have a car.

13:45.407 --> 13:48.202
And I would offer you a ride,
but I don't want to.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.370
Got it.

13:49.411 --> 13:51.539
I'll just... call an Uber.

13:52.748 --> 13:54.041
(exhales)

13:55.501 --> 13:56.877
Damn it.

13:56.919 --> 13:59.213
Ben!
<b></b>
What Ben? Ben...

13:59.255 --> 14:00.798
What?
<b></b>
He took my keys.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.925
Well, at least
now I know where he went.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.343
What? Where? Why?

14:04.385 --> 14:05.511
He's done this before.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.179
He steals my keys,

14:07.221 --> 14:08.764
and he goes to my storage space,

14:08.806 --> 14:10.724
and he crashes there
for a few days,

14:10.766 --> 14:12.518
so he can use
without me around.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.894
Well, maybe I should...

14:13.936 --> 14:15.271
go over there
and-and check on him.

14:15.312 --> 14:16.981
No, no. They're
not gonna let you in

14:17.022 --> 14:19.483
without a key, and I'm not going
there to get another one.

14:19.525 --> 14:22.194
I think it is worth a try,
you know?

14:22.236 --> 14:24.822
What-what, um, what's
the name of the place?

14:24.864 --> 14:27.700
It's Wilson Self-Storage
in Evanston.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.872
Guys, I think I know
where the drugs are.

14:39.628 --> 14:41.338
Officer Clemens.
<b></b>
Hey, what's up?

14:41.380 --> 14:43.465
Eh, I heard about Dean.

14:43.507 --> 14:44.758
It's a shame.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.468
Yeah. Chief's supposed
to assign me

14:46.510 --> 14:48.262
a new partner today, but...

14:48.304 --> 14:51.140
you know, you can't replace
Lean Dean the Narcotics Machine.

14:51.181 --> 14:54.351
Yeah. Anyway, a girl just
came in, confessing to aiding

14:54.393 --> 14:56.103
in the murder of Jules Becker.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.938
She claims Nia Bailey
ordered the hit.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.774
Nia Bailey had...
Dean's old partner killed.

15:00.816 --> 15:02.401
Well, if what she
says is true, yeah,

15:02.443 --> 15:04.028
but here's the strange thing.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.030
The one who confessed,
I ran a background check.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.656
She works at Guiding Hope.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.199
You're kidding.
<b></b>
I know you
and Riley

15:09.241 --> 15:10.743
were looking into that place.
You want to have

15:10.784 --> 15:12.244
a little chat with her
before I book her?

15:12.286 --> 15:14.413
Abso-freakin'-lutely I do.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.917
Thank you, brother.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.168
(door opens)

15:19.209 --> 15:20.794
GENE:
Hi.

15:21.962 --> 15:23.923
I'm, uh, Officer Clemens.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.257
Sterling Fuller.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.176
Pleasure to meet
you, Sterling.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.389
(sighs):
So...

15:32.431 --> 15:34.808
you want to tell me
Guiding Hope's involvement

15:34.850 --> 15:36.769
in Nia Bailey's organization?

15:36.810 --> 15:37.978
Um...

15:38.020 --> 15:39.396
Guiding... Guiding Hope?

15:39.438 --> 15:40.940
Mm-hmm.
<b></b>
I don't...

15:40.981 --> 15:42.358
I don't know what you mean.

15:42.399 --> 15:44.860
It's-it's my day job.
It's, um...

15:44.902 --> 15:46.612
I'm-I'm here
to talk to Homicide...

15:46.654 --> 15:48.948
We know that Guiding Hope
is working for Nia.

15:48.989 --> 15:51.325
I mean, the fact that you,
a Guiding Hope employee,

15:51.367 --> 15:52.660
had admitted
to also working for Nia,

15:52.701 --> 15:54.036
that just kind of sealed
the deal.

15:56.163 --> 15:57.581
(whispers):
Okay.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.833
Um, fine.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.710
Guiding Hope was, um...

16:01.752 --> 16:03.337
they were laundering m-money

16:03.379 --> 16:05.005
and hiding drugs for Nia.

16:05.047 --> 16:07.549
But they were forced into it--
I mean, they were held

16:07.591 --> 16:09.009
at gunpoint by Sam.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.887
I was just there to make sure
that they did their job

16:11.929 --> 16:14.682
and-and that they wouldn't...
tell anyone.

16:14.723 --> 16:16.850
But now?
<b></b>
They were about
to turn Nia in,

16:16.892 --> 16:19.520
so she fled before the cops
could get to her.

16:19.561 --> 16:22.356
And that's why
Sam and Vincent want them dead.

16:22.398 --> 16:23.983
And why I'm here.

16:24.024 --> 16:25.567
To stop that from happening.

16:25.609 --> 16:27.319
Here's what I
don't understand.

16:27.361 --> 16:28.696
Why risk holding

16:28.737 --> 16:30.280
a bunch of kids at gunpoint

16:30.322 --> 16:33.075
to move Nia's drugs
into their guide dog school?

16:33.117 --> 16:34.243
I don't know.

16:34.284 --> 16:36.161
You think that
may have had

16:36.203 --> 16:38.414
something to do with
why Sam killed Officer Becker?

16:38.455 --> 16:40.124
I really, I don't...

16:40.165 --> 16:42.251
I don't know.
Are you gonna arrest

16:42.292 --> 16:45.170
Sam and Vincent before they
start killing people, or not?

16:45.212 --> 16:47.464
We're gonna try.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.550
(bird cawing)

17:02.438 --> 17:04.857
Okay, it's right
over there.

17:04.898 --> 17:06.358
Oh, yeah?

17:08.444 --> 17:10.279
Hang on,
we're coming...
I got it.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.823
It'll be faster
if I do it alone, anyway.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.242
How would that
be faster?
It just will be.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.869
Just make sure
you get those keys.

17:16.910 --> 17:17.953
Felix says
we need those keys.

17:17.995 --> 17:19.788
I got it.

17:26.587 --> 17:28.714
(thumping, scraping)

17:32.843 --> 17:34.845
Oh, my God.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.431
What happened
between you two?

17:37.473 --> 17:38.640
Because he's acting
really weird.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.231
Oh, my God.

17:46.273 --> 17:47.983
You guys are so...

17:48.025 --> 17:49.109
gross!

17:49.151 --> 17:50.319
What?

17:50.360 --> 17:52.321
You had sex with him.

17:52.362 --> 17:53.822
(bird cawing)

17:53.864 --> 17:55.824
Do you seriously want
to talk about... that?
<b></b>
Yes.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.826
I would love to talk
about anything else

17:57.868 --> 18:00.037
than what's actually
going on right now,
so yes, I do.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.538
It just happened.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.415
I'm not proud of it.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.250
Now he won't even talk
to me, so...

18:05.292 --> 18:07.461
Well, yeah, 'cause you
kissed another guy, like,

18:07.503 --> 18:10.214
five feet from him
a few hours ago.
<b></b>
What was I supposed to do?

18:10.255 --> 18:11.507
I didn't plan that.

18:11.548 --> 18:12.883
Murphy...
<b></b>
And I like Josh.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.843
I can't help that.
<b></b>
But it's Max.

18:14.885 --> 18:16.428
It's always been Max, right?

18:17.638 --> 18:18.931
Yes.

18:20.432 --> 18:22.351
But now I don't...
I don't know.

18:22.392 --> 18:23.560
I don't know,
I just...

18:23.602 --> 18:25.687
I like who I am
when I'm with Josh.

18:26.897 --> 18:30.067
I'm... I'm, like,
a better person.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.653
That's because you're not
actually being yourself.

18:32.694 --> 18:34.822
You weren't really being
yourself with Sterling,

18:34.863 --> 18:38.450
but that didn't make...
what you felt any less real.

18:38.492 --> 18:41.036
Mm-hmm, that's very true, yeah.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.205
(sighs)
If we survive
until midnight,

18:43.247 --> 18:47.084
I'll make a decision
about my stupid love life.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.962
(music playing)
<b></b>
(indistinct chatter)

18:50.003 --> 18:51.964
Hey.

18:52.005 --> 18:54.299
I'll have a soda water
with lime, please?

18:54.341 --> 18:55.801
Sure.

18:57.469 --> 18:59.096
Do you happen to know
if this person

18:59.138 --> 19:01.348
came into the bar yesterday?

19:03.016 --> 19:04.685
Sorry, no.

19:10.023 --> 19:11.358
Dean?

19:11.400 --> 19:13.110
Hey.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.361
Why do you have a picture
of my brother?

19:15.362 --> 19:17.072
Is this your brother?

19:17.114 --> 19:18.991
Yeah. Is he okay?

19:19.032 --> 19:21.201
You two don't have
the same last name.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.828
We don't have the same dad.

19:22.870 --> 19:25.038
Is he okay? What did he do?
<b></b>
Nothing.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.415
He's fine. I just, um....

19:26.456 --> 19:29.042
Do you happen to know
where he is?

19:29.084 --> 19:30.669
I'd like to ask him
a couple questions.

19:30.711 --> 19:31.837
I have no idea where he is.

19:33.213 --> 19:36.091
I'd really, really
like you to leave.

19:36.133 --> 19:37.634
Please?

19:42.389 --> 19:44.099
CHRIS: Chels,
can you close tonight?

19:44.141 --> 19:45.350
Yeah. I just, I need your keys.

19:45.392 --> 19:47.436
My brother
took mine.

19:50.647 --> 19:52.983
Actually, I'd like to take
a look around, please.

19:54.234 --> 19:56.111
I just told you he's not here.
<b></b>
I know.

19:56.153 --> 19:58.113
But there was an incident
at a nearby establishment.

19:58.155 --> 19:59.907
There could be
some evidence here.

19:59.948 --> 20:01.992
Do you have a warrant?

20:04.244 --> 20:05.954
Do you know that it's
Illinois state law

20:05.996 --> 20:07.581
to display a government
warning sign

20:07.623 --> 20:10.209
stating the dangers
of drinking while pregnant?

20:10.250 --> 20:12.419
I don't see one anywhere here.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.463
So unless you would like to lose

20:14.504 --> 20:15.547
your liquor
license...

20:15.589 --> 20:16.632
CHRIS: Chels,
it's fine.

20:16.673 --> 20:17.966
Go ahead and look around.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.595
Thank you.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.680
(indistinct radio chatter)

20:36.193 --> 20:38.487
I always wanted
to make one of these.

20:38.528 --> 20:40.072
You know, they
got software.

20:40.113 --> 20:42.157
I wanted to make one, you know?

20:42.199 --> 20:44.451
Okay, well, here.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.704
Let me give you
a hand.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.081
He...

20:49.122 --> 20:51.333
was found dead
in his car.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.168
Prints in the car match those

20:53.210 --> 20:55.212
of Samantha Rogers.
Damn!

20:55.254 --> 20:57.172
Ruthless.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.840
So what are you looking for?

20:58.882 --> 21:00.801
Even if Nia fled,

21:00.842 --> 21:02.511
I still want to get
that warrant for her arrest.

21:02.552 --> 21:04.888
Make sure that Dean's work
wasn't in vain, you know?

21:04.930 --> 21:07.766
I just, I can't find
that smoking gun.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.768
Sterling's testimony
won't be enough.

21:09.810 --> 21:11.395
Any luck?

21:11.436 --> 21:12.604
Jules must've gotten killed

21:12.646 --> 21:13.981
because she had
something big on Nia.

21:14.022 --> 21:15.649
I just have no idea

21:15.691 --> 21:17.067
what that thing is.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.777
Me neither.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.529
I got to go.

21:20.570 --> 21:21.947
You serious?

21:21.989 --> 21:24.408
Yeah, I got an APB
out on this Sam gal.

21:24.449 --> 21:26.451
We got to get her before
she hurts anyone else.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.870
But if I were you...
I'd look into

21:28.912 --> 21:30.872
the last case
Becker had.

21:30.914 --> 21:32.249
I don't know.

21:32.291 --> 21:35.294
Maybe that's what
got her killed.

21:35.335 --> 21:37.379

21:41.758 --> 21:43.677
GENE:
What did you know?

21:43.719 --> 21:45.053

Your badge number?

21:45.095 --> 21:46.263
GENE:
Nine, one, six, five,

21:46.305 --> 21:47.264
seven, nine.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.849
And what are you
requesting?

21:48.890 --> 21:51.101
All open files assigned
to Officer Jules Becker

21:51.143 --> 21:53.186

Hey.

22:12.664 --> 22:15.125

22:20.547 --> 22:21.715
Did you get the backpack?

22:21.757 --> 22:22.966
Yeah.

22:23.008 --> 22:24.509
His phone isn't charged,

22:24.551 --> 22:26.011
so it'll have to get
recharged along the way.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.554
Okay, well,
forget about the phone.

22:27.596 --> 22:28.805

22:28.847 --> 22:29.890
Yes, yes, they're

23:14.351 --> 23:16.144
All right.

23:16.186 --> 23:19.356
Now, show me where

23:35.372 --> 23:37.290
Okay, what is up with you?

23:37.332 --> 23:39.709
Sorry?
<b></b>
I just got my ass handed to me

23:39.751 --> 23:42.087
by Robinson
because of another huge mistake

23:42.129 --> 23:43.547
in one of our reports.

23:43.588 --> 23:45.465
Oh, my God, Pam, I'm sorry.
I must have...

23:45.507 --> 23:47.759
You used to be...
I could... I could count on you.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.177
Now, I don't know.

23:49.219 --> 23:50.887
It was just a stupid mistake.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.305
(quietly):
And it's not the first one.

23:52.347 --> 23:54.307
Do you want
to explain to me why I am

23:54.349 --> 23:55.767
suddenly covering up
for you all the time?

23:55.809 --> 23:57.310
Well, uh...

23:57.352 --> 23:58.770
Josh, it's me.

23:58.812 --> 24:03.442
Like... what... is going on?

24:07.404 --> 24:09.197
Let's meet

24:09.239 --> 24:11.116

24:13.535 --> 24:15.954
Okay.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.385
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Text from Josh.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.015
Go ahead.

24:35.056 --> 24:36.391
Answer it.

24:36.433 --> 24:37.893
I'm not gonna do that.

Trust me.

24:37.934 --> 24:39.352
It would be a

24:39.394 --> 24:41.396
to listening
to you guys flirt.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.773
I wasn't flirting
with him.
Jess?

24:43.815 --> 24:45.442
Nope. I'm not engaging.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.152
I'm sorry.

MAX:
Wow.

I'm sorry. I don't...
I don't know what else to say.

24:48.695 --> 24:50.864
Dude, nothing.
You-you say nothing.

24:50.906 --> 24:53.325
Is this really what we should be
focusing on right now?

24:53.366 --> 24:55.202
It's hard for me to focus
on anything else.

24:59.247 --> 25:00.832
(sighs)

25:00.874 --> 25:03.418
It just sucks because I...

25:03.460 --> 25:06.379

Hi. I thought my
dad was with you.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.738

Oh. Okay, yeah.

25:39.162 --> 25:42.290
I-I must have
just missed him ,then.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.000
He didn't go to work, did he?

25:44.042 --> 25:45.669
Oh, well, I don't...
I don't know.

I should go.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.411
Frank, this is Gene

26:19.452 --> 26:21.246
I'm trying to find someone, man.

26:21.288 --> 26:23.373
Uh, can you run
a credit card for me?

26:23.415 --> 26:25.125
Yeah, I'll put it through.

26:25.166 --> 26:26.543
Thanks.

26:26.585 --> 26:29.546
(indistinct voice over phone)

26:29.588 --> 26:31.756
Yeah, I'll get you the number.
Give me a sec.

26:36.344 --> 26:38.388
(knocking)

26:40.765 --> 26:42.142
Open up.

26:42.183 --> 26:44.477
Chicago PD!

26:48.523 --> 26:50.525
What's going on?

26:50.567 --> 26:52.819
Can I ask you
a couple questions?

27:05.248 --> 27:08.043
(dog barking in distance)

27:08.084 --> 27:10.378
I'm sorry. You want
something to drink?

27:10.420 --> 27:12.797
I have beer, water.

27:12.839 --> 27:14.549
I guess
that's about it.

27:14.591 --> 27:16.092
Nah, I'm-I'm good.

27:16.134 --> 27:18.053
Thank you, though.

27:18.094 --> 27:19.846
So...

27:19.888 --> 27:21.973
I move all the way
out to the suburbs,

27:22.015 --> 27:24.225
I'm still getting in trouble
with Chicago PD, huh?

27:24.267 --> 27:25.769
Nah, you're not
in trouble, man.

27:25.810 --> 27:27.729
Not with us, at least.

27:27.771 --> 27:30.231
I assume
it's with someone, given...

27:30.273 --> 27:32.525
you're here.

27:32.567 --> 27:35.028
here?

27:36.488 --> 27:38.448
I'm trying to figure out
what you knew

27:38.490 --> 27:41.493
about Nia's organization
that got Jules Becker killed.

27:41.534 --> 27:43.578
Jules Becker was killed?

27:43.620 --> 27:45.080
Don't play dumb.

27:45.121 --> 27:47.582
You know Nia ordered that hit.

27:47.624 --> 27:49.793
So here's
what I'm thinking.

27:49.834 --> 27:52.337
You got arrested
for the murder of Tyson Parker,

27:52.379 --> 27:54.964
so you worked out a deal
with Detective Becker.

27:55.006 --> 27:57.175
She dropped the charges
in return

27:57.217 --> 27:59.844
for something big enough
to take down Nia, but

27:59.886 --> 28:02.806
that information is
what got her killed.

28:02.847 --> 28:06.559
I loved Jules Becker.

28:06.601 --> 28:09.521
And that you'd walk in here
and accuse me of being

28:09.562 --> 28:11.106
the reason that she got killed,

28:11.147 --> 28:15.193
after your people
planted evidence on me...

28:17.987 --> 28:19.864
Excuse me?

28:19.906 --> 28:21.950
You really think
Jules could have gotten

28:21.991 --> 28:24.911
a murder charge dropped
for a little bit of intel?

28:26.663 --> 28:28.623
What makes you think...

28:28.665 --> 28:31.209
that evidence was planted
on you?

28:31.251 --> 28:33.336
Why don't you ask Dean Riley?

28:35.880 --> 28:38.717
I'm done, so...

28:38.758 --> 28:40.719
you can leave now.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.016
(sighs heavily)

28:47.058 --> 28:48.601
It's quiet here.

28:48.643 --> 28:51.229
You miss Chicago?

28:51.271 --> 28:53.481
I like the quiet.

28:53.523 --> 28:57.068
Yeah, Nia...

28:57.110 --> 29:00.655
She must like the quiet, too,
because... she fled the country

29:00.697 --> 29:03.283
right before
we could get to her, so...

29:03.324 --> 29:04.701
looks like
you all got out just in time.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.327
Good for you.

29:18.006 --> 29:19.424
JOSH:
So, there it is.

29:19.466 --> 29:22.635

Agents require a visual acuity

29:29.350 --> 29:31.644

29:31.686 --> 29:33.855
You can still
work at the IRS,

just in a different
division, right?

29:35.356 --> 29:37.066
What, and just be
a number cruncher? No.

29:37.108 --> 29:40.111
I won't get
to catch Nia Bailey, Pam.

29:40.153 --> 29:43.072
Well, I mean, it's like,
all this work we've been doing,

29:43.114 --> 29:44.949
mapping out her network,
and-and what? What?

29:44.991 --> 29:47.452
I'm meant to just
stand on the sideline and watch?

29:47.494 --> 29:50.288
No. It sucks.

29:50.330 --> 29:51.998
Might be too late. Her
cleaners didn't open today.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.500
That's never happened.

29:53.541 --> 29:55.460
Well, I know people
at the office think she's dead.

29:55.502 --> 29:56.169
What if she isn't?

29:59.422 --> 30:02.300
You don't have to tell
do you?

30:04.135 --> 30:05.762
Took me three years
to break you in.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.389

Well, you think the spaces

Maybe.

That doesn't make any sense!

37:03.221 --> 37:06.474
Okay, here, hold these
for a second.

37:06.515 --> 37:08.517
Okay, so,

37:08.559 --> 37:12.104
based on the time
Ben left Guiding Hope

37:12.146 --> 37:14.148
with the drugs,

37:14.190 --> 37:17.735
and when we got the call
learning he'd hidden them,

37:17.777 --> 37:20.238
plus factoring in the time
from that call

37:20.279 --> 37:21.948
to when we met him
at the Linsmore,

37:21.989 --> 37:25.576
I would say he couldn't have
gotten further than, like,

37:25.618 --> 37:28.120
six miles from the radius
of the midpoint

37:28.162 --> 37:30.248
between the Linsmore
and Guiding Hope,

37:30.289 --> 37:32.041
unless he took the expressway,
which would have been, like...

37:32.083 --> 37:33.751
What's this key?

JESS:
Which one?

37:33.793 --> 37:35.419

37:38.631 --> 37:40.299
This one's the-the--

37:40.341 --> 37:42.218
This big one's for the Linsmore.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.886
Or the other way arou--
Or the other way around.

37:43.928 --> 37:47.265
But then this one is
for the storage space.

37:47.306 --> 37:49.141
But this little one is
unaccounted for.

37:49.183 --> 37:50.685
Let me see.
What is...

37:50.726 --> 37:52.019
Let me see it.

37:52.061 --> 37:53.854
Does she, uh-- Does she
belong to a gym?

37:53.896 --> 37:54.522
Maybe it's for a locker?

37:54.563 --> 37:57.942
No, no, she only worked out
in her living room.

37:57.984 --> 37:59.902
She never stopped
talking about it.

37:59.944 --> 38:02.446

What?

38:32.977 --> 38:35.229
It doesn't matter.

38:35.271 --> 38:37.106

38:37.148 --> 38:38.232

It's just... for months you say
you want to be with me,

comes out of nowhere,

38:47.783 --> 38:49.869

38:49.910 --> 38:51.162
you gotta pick, Murphy,
