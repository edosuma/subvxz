WEBVTT

00:02.171 --> 00:04.139
We're here!

00:04.173 --> 00:06.841
The immigrants have arrived!
Oh, darn it!

00:06.876 --> 00:09.844
I wanted to have everything put
away by the time you got here.

00:09.879 --> 00:11.846
Oh, come on, mom.
We're only here for three days.

00:11.881 --> 00:14.949
We're not waiting out the apocalypse.
But I've got cooper's cereal...

00:14.984 --> 00:18.887
Ah! Look. Orange juice for paige.
You brought your own food?

00:18.921 --> 00:21.890
w - What's the matter with mine?
The painter said with all the sanding,

00:21.924 --> 00:25.027
there's gonna be too much dust.
I didn't want to waste it.

00:25.061 --> 00:27.529
You know what,
sarah? It's such a good idea.

00:27.563 --> 00:29.998
Luc is moving in,
so you're giving the whole pla

00:30.033 --> 00:32.433
a brand-new coat of paint
for a fresh new start.

00:32.468 --> 00:34.436
Yeah, I hope it's not too fresh.

00:34.470 --> 00:36.671
You know, it's a big
adjustment for everyone.

00:36.705 --> 00:39.707
Cooper's going a little...
Crazy. Mom,

00:39.742 --> 00:42.710
can I play my video game?! Yes,
I have become that mom

00:42.745 --> 00:45.447
that uses video games
as a babysitting device.

00:45.481 --> 00:47.615
Trust me, it's
better for all of us.

00:47.650 --> 00:50.185
Shh. Grandma, can I set
this up in the living room?

00:50.219 --> 00:52.187
Yes, after you give me my hug.
Where's my hug?

00:52.221 --> 00:54.189
Okay! Hug! Hug! Hug! Come on.

00:54.223 --> 00:55.890
Hugs. Oh! Ohh!

00:55.925 --> 00:57.559
Mmm! Thank you.

00:57.593 --> 00:59.227
Oh, where's paige?

00:59.262 --> 01:01.229
Oh, she's doing a girl
scout camping weekend.

01:01.264 --> 01:03.098
No internet, no cell phones.

01:03.132 --> 01:06.134
Luc's convinced she's
gonna come home a whole

01:07.870 --> 01:09.671
hey. oh, luc, congratulations.

01:09.705 --> 01:12.074
You've got your own set
of keys and everything.

01:12.108 --> 01:13.408
Yeah. mm.

01:13.443 --> 01:15.243
I am a pasadenian now.

01:15.278 --> 01:18.646
A pasadenian? You are a pasadenian,
that's for sure.

01:18.681 --> 01:20.148
Sarah? Mm-hmm.

01:20.183 --> 01:22.150
Narrow lake...
What's going on? Oh...

01:22.185 --> 01:24.453
Mom, look! I'm drilling
for buried treasure.

01:24.487 --> 01:27.122
Uh, cooper's become obsessed

01:27.156 --> 01:29.124
with the drilling
we're doing up there.

01:29.158 --> 01:31.293
Maybe he'll become a geologist.

01:31.327 --> 01:33.462
Oh, have they found
anything yet?

01:33.496 --> 01:36.798
Cooper. No, they haven't,
but I hope they find something soon

01:36.832 --> 01:39.534
because the hole they're digging
isn't just in the ground.

01:39.569 --> 01:42.370
We are hemorrhaging cash.
We just need to have a little faith.

01:42.405 --> 01:44.372
I- I'm certain there's
something of value there.

01:44.407 --> 01:46.708
I'm just certain of it.
Well, I hope you're right, mom,

01:46.742 --> 01:49.377
'cause we're betting the company on it.
Cooper. Cooper, your mom and your
grandma

01:49.412 --> 01:51.846
are trying to have a
conversation. Stop it.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.848
What? I can't
understand your accent.

01:53.882 --> 01:55.016
Cooper!

01:55.050 --> 01:58.153
Excuse me. That is very rude.

01:59.589 --> 02:01.789
Oh, you know what?

02:01.824 --> 02:05.960
I'm just gonna unpack your stuff
just over here out of the way.

02:05.995 --> 02:07.262
That's it?

02:07.296 --> 02:09.797
Well, I told him it was rude.

02:09.832 --> 02:14.402
He's 8 years old. What else do you
want me to say to him? Talk to him.

02:14.437 --> 02:16.538
Okay, cooper, time-out.

02:16.572 --> 02:19.774
<i>Because he said so? No,
because i said so.</i>

02:19.808 --> 02:22.511
That chair, five minutes.
Right now.

02:22.545 --> 02:26.281
<i>Mom, i am too old for time-outs.
I don't care.</i>

02:28.717 --> 02:31.186
You know, sarah,
he really is right.

02:31.220 --> 02:34.756
After about 5 or 6,
there needs to be some consequences.

02:36.292 --> 02:38.493
Okay, everybody take time-out.

02:38.528 --> 02:41.062
Oh. It's the drilling company.
Excuse me.

02:41.096 --> 02:44.065
Hello? Yes. Thanks for calling me back.
Grandma, when's lunch?

02:44.099 --> 02:46.801
Cooper, time-out.

02:46.835 --> 02:48.470
Okay. Yep, do it. Thank you.

02:48.504 --> 02:50.805
What did they say?

02:50.839 --> 02:53.808
What they always say, mom.
They need more money to dig deeper.

02:53.842 --> 02:56.578
They'll call me if
they find anything.

02:56.612 --> 03:00.081
Ojal's gonna have to sell some more
land to pay for this. I'm hungry.

03:00.115 --> 03:02.250
What do you want...
Peanut butter and jelly,

03:02.285 --> 03:05.086
string cheese and grapes? Sarah,
what happened to the time-out?

03:05.120 --> 03:07.755
Well I thought nobody
liked time-out anymore.

03:07.790 --> 03:09.691
Is there any mac and cheese?

03:09.725 --> 03:12.160
He's hungry. That's probably
why he's going so crazy.

03:12.195 --> 03:14.529
Honestly, what do you
want me to do, starve him?

03:14.564 --> 03:16.864
No, but at least five
minutes of time-out.

03:16.899 --> 03:19.367
That's what it's all about.
I mean, I can take him upstairs.

03:19.402 --> 03:21.670
He's been like that for
a week now. A week?

03:21.704 --> 03:23.672
We had an incident at school...
A small thing...

03:23.706 --> 03:26.107
Jamie barton,
her ponytail and a stapler.

03:26.141 --> 03:27.875
Let me take him upstairs.

03:27.910 --> 03:31.346
If he's hungry, honestly,
there's no point.

03:31.380 --> 03:34.949
Okay, let me take the
bags upstairs. Thank you.

03:34.983 --> 03:37.719
Does this mean my
time-out's over? Shh!

03:37.753 --> 03:41.122
Yes. Go. Get out of here. Scram.

03:41.156 --> 03:42.390
Cha-ching!

03:42.425 --> 03:45.660
Stay out of trouble. Ahh. Okay.

03:48.897 --> 03:51.132
Is everything okay
with the two of you?

03:51.166 --> 03:54.836
He's an 8-year-old boy, mom.
You've been there.

03:54.870 --> 03:57.572
No. Luc. Between you and luc.

03:57.607 --> 04:00.375
Oh! Yeah. No, we're fine.
I'm gonna make this work, mom.

04:00.409 --> 04:03.811
I just wish people could
be more... Patient.

04:03.846 --> 04:06.047
Transitions are hard.

04:11.086 --> 04:13.255
Look, we could maybe
start with crepes.

04:13.289 --> 04:15.590
Mm. Have you ever been to
one of those crepe places?

04:15.625 --> 04:17.659
No, never been,
but I have thought about it.

04:17.692 --> 04:19.661
Well, I want people to do more

04:19.695 --> 04:22.697
than just consider eating at our
restaurant. How serious are you guys
about this?

04:22.732 --> 04:24.699
Ask him. He's the
one with the money.

04:24.734 --> 04:26.768
Well, I've often thought
about opening a restaurant,

04:26.802 --> 04:30.538
and this would be a perfect time. What
about a wine bar? You know, with...
With the big taps.

04:30.573 --> 04:33.007
Well, we... We talked about that.
It requires a liquor license.

04:33.041 --> 04:35.710
That takes forever. Okay, fine.
Don't sell booze.

04:35.745 --> 04:39.381
Don't expect our family to show up.
Excuse me. The point of this is not to
feed our family.

04:39.415 --> 04:42.717
The point is to make some money. Well,
when you need a lawyer to draw up your
contracts,

04:42.752 --> 04:44.519
give me a call. Sure. Maybe.

04:44.553 --> 04:46.921
<i>Maybe? I was a corporate
litigator for ten years.</i>

04:46.955 --> 04:50.158
I think I can draw up a property
contract. Of course you can.

04:50.192 --> 04:52.327
I just meant that
hopefully you'll be busy

04:52.361 --> 04:55.096
doing something else by then.
I'm busy doing something else today.

04:55.130 --> 04:57.766
<i>Sarah, who actually wants my help,
has asked me</i>

04:57.800 --> 04:59.834
to look over the ojal
drilling contracts.

04:59.868 --> 05:02.437
So good luck with your restaurant. I
have work to do. Kevin, don't be upset.

05:02.471 --> 05:05.072
I'm not upset. I'm just busy.

05:06.842 --> 05:11.145
The contract to train
the somali police...

05:11.180 --> 05:14.081
Bill stanton wants it
awarded to his company.

05:14.116 --> 05:16.083
Yeah, of course he does.

05:16.118 --> 05:18.586
It's a massive, open-ended
commitment. And obviously,

05:18.621 --> 05:21.289
he needs your committee
to appropriate the funds.

05:21.324 --> 05:24.258
And I wanna catch him cheating.

05:24.293 --> 05:26.828
National security
shouldn't make you rich.

05:26.862 --> 05:29.664
I understand. So I
should wait for his call?

05:29.699 --> 05:33.401
Actually, there's a benefit
at his club tomorrow...

05:33.436 --> 05:35.069
A tennis tournament.

05:35.103 --> 05:37.305
Excuse me.

05:37.340 --> 05:39.541
Oh, it's my wife.

05:39.575 --> 05:41.643
All right, what'd you forget?

05:41.677 --> 05:43.144
Okay, I'm meeting with jim hix.

05:43.178 --> 05:45.179
You said something
about education cuts.

05:45.214 --> 05:47.181
Was that a "don't forget to
bring it up" or "steer clear"?

05:47.216 --> 05:49.818
Well, that depends on whether
he's with carolyn or not.

05:49.852 --> 05:51.820
Carolyn? Carolyn?
Carolyn! Carolyn! Right, his wife!

05:51.854 --> 05:53.221
<i>Uh, y-yeah.</i>

05:53.255 --> 05:55.323
Superintendent of humboldt
county schools carolyn.

05:55.358 --> 05:58.326
Right. Thank you. I'm so glad
I called you. Was evan awake?

05:58.361 --> 06:00.395
No, he's still asleep.

06:00.429 --> 06:02.497
Aw. All right, well,
make sure you send me

06:02.531 --> 06:04.566
a lot of pictures, okay? Okay.
And listen,

06:04.600 --> 06:06.634
you concentrate on getting
those endorsements

06:06.669 --> 06:09.303
'cause they could really turn
this campaign around, right?

06:09.338 --> 06:13.341
Yeah, right. From your lips... Oh,
robert, I love you.

06:13.376 --> 06:14.843
Love you.

06:14.877 --> 06:15.844
Sorry.

06:15.878 --> 06:18.513
She after an
endorsement from hix?

06:18.547 --> 06:21.215
Yeah. She's gunning
for mccarty, too.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.785
She's on her way
to sacramento now.

06:23.819 --> 06:26.521
She's worked really
hard for this, and...

06:26.555 --> 06:28.523
That's the issue for me,

06:28.557 --> 06:30.825
is if I get on the
wrong side of stanton,

06:30.860 --> 06:33.094
her campaign will be
the first casualty.

06:33.128 --> 06:35.764
They will come after her hard.

06:35.798 --> 06:38.767
My hat is off to kitty.
It's a damn fine virgin run.

06:38.801 --> 06:40.769
But she's not getting
those endorsements.

06:40.803 --> 06:43.605
The far right is going
to determine the primary,

06:43.639 --> 06:45.607
and they don't like her.

06:45.641 --> 06:47.108
All due respect,

06:47.142 --> 06:49.611
don't worry about harming
your wife's campaign.

06:49.645 --> 06:52.046
It'll be over this
time next month.

06:52.080 --> 06:54.416
Joe, I've known you a long time,

06:54.450 --> 06:56.684
but let me tell you something.

06:56.719 --> 06:58.920
Never bet against my wife.

07:02.758 --> 07:04.659
hey.

07:04.693 --> 07:06.661
Uh, why do you look like kitty

07:06.695 --> 07:09.798
at one of her fund-raisers?
Is it that bad?

07:09.832 --> 07:12.534
Pearls? Well, the bungalow that
I love is having an open house.

07:12.568 --> 07:15.537
And apparently, the selling
agent takes you more seriously

07:15.571 --> 07:17.972
if you look professional, so... I
heard they also take you seriously

07:18.006 --> 07:21.476
if you actually have the
money to pay for the house.

07:21.510 --> 07:23.812
Ha ha. Very funny.
I'm just going to check it out.

07:23.846 --> 07:25.313
You want to come?

07:25.347 --> 07:27.882
Uh, no, because I am actually
trying to make lasagna.

07:27.917 --> 07:30.217
Wait. You're cooking? Yeah.

07:30.252 --> 07:32.487
Jake's wife jessica
is a vegetarian.

07:32.521 --> 07:36.958
I figured I'd make something and...
And bring it on over.

07:36.992 --> 07:39.561
Is this them? Yeah, yeah.

07:39.595 --> 07:43.297
She asked me if I had any
pictures to bring over.

07:44.967 --> 07:46.935
Hey, maybe you could, um,

07:46.969 --> 07:49.504
you could grab something at that
organic place on main street.

07:49.538 --> 07:51.339
They have really good food.

07:51.373 --> 07:54.008
You know, her husband was
just killed by an i.e.d.

07:54.042 --> 07:56.277
I think I should
probably cook something.

07:56.311 --> 07:58.279
You're right. Maybe soup?

07:58.313 --> 08:00.414
Soup's a lot easier,
and it's comforting.

08:00.449 --> 08:03.351
Yeah, maybe soup.

08:03.385 --> 08:05.487
Justin, are you okay?

08:05.521 --> 08:07.489
Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

08:07.523 --> 08:10.291
'cause ever since the funeral... No,
no, I really am.

08:10.325 --> 08:12.794
I just, uh, you know,
want to do something nice

08:12.828 --> 08:14.629
and... And help her out.

08:14.663 --> 08:16.764
That's nice.

08:16.799 --> 08:18.633
You want some company?

08:18.667 --> 08:22.269
Um, no, no. You go
check out your house.

08:22.304 --> 08:25.306
It would be our house.
Right. Our house.

08:28.744 --> 08:30.612
bye.

Sync by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

08:48.063 --> 08:49.531
What are you doing here?

08:49.565 --> 08:51.533
This is what
unemployed losers do.

08:51.567 --> 08:54.302
They hang out in their mother's
kitchens making sandwiches.

08:54.337 --> 08:56.304
You want a turkey and swiss?

08:56.339 --> 08:58.807
There's, like, 4 pounds of meat in here.
I know. Don't ask.

08:58.841 --> 09:00.308
Make two or three.

09:00.343 --> 09:01.509
Okay.

09:01.544 --> 09:03.545
So how's the big move in going?

09:03.579 --> 09:06.013
Oh, you know... It's going.

09:06.048 --> 09:08.516
Did you get a chance to
look over those contracts?

09:08.551 --> 09:10.017
Yeah, it's all pretty standard.

09:10.052 --> 09:12.354
The longer they keep drilling,
the more you have to pay.

09:12.388 --> 09:14.356
Well, according to the
local well records

09:14.390 --> 09:16.290
for the surrounding area,

09:16.325 --> 09:19.060
there's gotta be at lea water there.
Okay, so all you can do now is wait.

09:19.094 --> 09:21.062
Which I'm really bad at.
Well, where is luc?

09:21.096 --> 09:23.765
He usually manages to distract me.
Actually, we're fighting.

09:23.799 --> 09:25.767
Oh, stop. He's too
beautiful for that.

09:25.801 --> 09:27.268
Nobody's too beautiful for that.

09:27.302 --> 09:29.270
Oh, wow. You really
do need help.

09:29.304 --> 09:32.106
You know what goes well
with waiting? Turkey?

09:32.140 --> 09:33.441
Wine!

09:33.476 --> 09:35.910
<i>Are you guys always here? I know.
It's sad.</i>

09:35.944 --> 09:39.113
Hey, evan. Come give
me a kiss, buddy.

09:39.147 --> 09:41.315
Careful. He might eat you. Mwah.

09:41.350 --> 09:44.252
He's got the appetite of a football
player. He's grown. Hey, beautiful. Do
you want a glass?

09:44.286 --> 09:46.755
No. I'm gonna wait
till the sun goes down.

09:46.789 --> 09:49.257
And besides,
I gotta play tennis.

09:49.291 --> 09:51.626
Tennis? You know, I got roped into
playing this doubles tournament.

09:51.660 --> 09:54.562
So I figured i'd go
and hit with the pro.

09:54.597 --> 09:56.831
Why don't you ask this
pro standing right here?

09:56.866 --> 09:58.633
You mean drinking right there.

09:58.667 --> 10:02.003
I was awesome back in the day.
We were awesome.

10:02.037 --> 10:03.772
huh.

10:03.806 --> 10:06.007
Kevrah. Kevrah.

10:06.041 --> 10:07.842
Kevrah.

10:07.877 --> 10:09.977
Kevrah. Kevrah.

10:10.012 --> 10:12.514
Kevrah. Kevrah. Kevrah. Kevrah.

10:14.149 --> 10:16.684
Got him. Then what happened?

10:16.719 --> 10:18.686
Uh, well, there was so
much smoke and sand,

10:18.721 --> 10:21.188
I couldn't see, but I
felt this guy grab my leg,

10:21.223 --> 10:23.825
so I reached down and picked
him up and guess what.

10:23.859 --> 10:26.160
It was my buddy brian.
That's unbelievable.

10:26.194 --> 10:28.730
Yeah, it was pretty cool. Look
out! Oh, go left, go left, go left!

10:28.764 --> 10:31.533
Left, left, left. Left, left, left.
Left, left, left, left, left. Oh, get
him right there.

10:31.567 --> 10:33.868
What are you doing?! Grandma.

10:33.903 --> 10:35.870
We're just playing.
You have been playing for hours.

10:35.905 --> 10:37.705
It's a beautiful day outside.

10:37.740 --> 10:40.642
Why don't you go outside and play? Just
let me kill a couple more invaders.

10:40.676 --> 10:43.745
Get him, get him. He's right there.
Right there. Right there. Justin,
darling, I love you.

10:43.779 --> 10:46.213
But why are you here?
I need to make soup for a friend,

10:46.248 --> 10:49.083
and I was wondering if you could
help me. What, like chicken soup?

10:49.117 --> 10:51.653
You know a hundred doctors.
You're in med school.

10:51.687 --> 10:54.856
Have 'em write a prescription. I have
my hands full today. She's not sick,
mom.

10:54.890 --> 10:57.492
It's jake's widow... The guy
who died in afghanistan. Oh.

10:57.526 --> 10:59.861
Got him. Got him. Got him? You got him.
Head shot. Head shot. Ooh!

10:59.895 --> 11:02.396
Okay, cooper, time's up.
Time's up. Here.

11:02.431 --> 11:04.666
You can take this. Go outside.
Shoot some hoops.

11:04.700 --> 11:07.101
Look at all the stuff I
drug out of the garage.

11:07.135 --> 11:10.705
Yeah, and stay in the yard and don't
go near the pool. Miss you, buddy.

11:10.739 --> 11:13.708
Okay, come on. Let's go make some soup.
All right. Just let me kill this one
more bad guy.

11:13.742 --> 11:16.444
I'll be there in two minutes.
Love you, ma.

11:16.479 --> 11:18.880
I can't bring stragglers, you guys.
It's a private club.

11:18.914 --> 11:20.882
What club? Altadena tennis club.

11:20.916 --> 11:22.717
Card-carrying members.

11:22.751 --> 11:24.853
Since 1982. Yeah.

11:24.887 --> 11:28.456
hey.

11:28.491 --> 11:32.193
What, are you two drinking? It's not
even noon. We're being european.

11:32.227 --> 11:33.795
Yeah. You're being something.

11:33.829 --> 11:36.130
Don't worry. We're leaving.
We have to practice

11:36.164 --> 11:38.867
for a tennis tournament.
Now... Now wait a minute. Just hold on.

11:38.901 --> 11:41.769
Tell him how great we were as doubles.
They were good. They were very, very
good.

11:41.804 --> 11:44.438
Of course, they almost got thrown out
of the club. She only slapped him.

11:44.473 --> 11:46.908
Mom, it was a bad call,
and you know it. Yeah.

11:46.942 --> 11:49.310
Oh, kevin. I can't. Why not?

11:49.344 --> 11:51.412
I've got cooper for the weekend.
Well, when is the tournament?

11:51.446 --> 11:53.648
Well, it's, uh, tomorrow. Today is
just practice. Well, that's perfect.

11:53.682 --> 11:55.550
I can take care of cooper today,

11:55.584 --> 11:57.485
and tomorrow,
he's got a play date.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.988
No, but, mom, I was gonna
take him to the play date

12:00.022 --> 12:02.824
and stay with him. He's 8 years old.
I think one mom is enough.

12:02.858 --> 12:06.327
I don't know about that. Sarah,
think about this. It would be fabulous.

12:06.361 --> 12:10.698
It would be robert and
kevin against you and luc.

12:10.733 --> 12:12.700
No. I mean, the whole point

12:12.735 --> 12:15.937
is that kevrah was
great together. Yeah.

12:15.971 --> 12:18.940
We don't even know if luc can play.
Probably not.

12:18.974 --> 12:20.975
Well, now's yourururnce
to find out.

12:21.010 --> 12:22.977
It would be wonderful
for the two of you

12:23.012 --> 12:25.046
to have some adult time, honey.

12:25.080 --> 12:26.781
So it's done. Take them away.

12:26.815 --> 12:29.316
Yes. Can I make a
deal with you? Yeah.

12:29.351 --> 12:31.819
Will you watch him till the
nanny gets here? Absolutely.

12:31.854 --> 12:35.156
<i>Good, good, good. And then I get
to play with kevrah. kevrah.</i>

12:35.190 --> 12:37.025
Well, and luc.

12:37.059 --> 12:39.694
Yeah. And luc.

12:39.728 --> 12:41.696
It's perfect, isn't it?

12:41.730 --> 12:43.565
mm. It looks amazing.

12:45.901 --> 12:47.936
I think you should do it. What?

12:47.970 --> 12:50.271
You mean, like... Like,
put an offer in?

12:50.305 --> 12:53.207
You have the money.
Pull it from ojal and transfer it

12:53.241 --> 12:55.910
into your personal account
and make an offer.

12:55.945 --> 12:57.845
Mom, the agent already
got two offers.

12:57.880 --> 13:00.915
They always say that.
That's a sales technique.

13:00.950 --> 13:03.718
I saw a couple take
out their checkbook.

13:03.752 --> 13:06.554
Well, then transfer the
money and take out yours.

13:06.589 --> 13:09.757
It's just an offer. You're not
obligated to spend a dime.

13:09.792 --> 13:12.760
So what, just pick up the phone
and make a couple of calls?

13:12.795 --> 13:15.262
Yeah. That's all you have to do.

13:15.297 --> 13:17.765
If you really love this house...

13:17.800 --> 13:20.602
Then make it happen.

13:22.938 --> 13:24.973
She's looking at a house?

13:25.007 --> 13:26.774
That's very exciting.

13:26.809 --> 13:29.611
Yeah. Well, she's just looking,
so it's not really a big deal.

13:29.645 --> 13:32.313
It's a really big deal.
It would be your first house.

13:32.347 --> 13:33.815
Ma, we're not buying anything,

13:33.849 --> 13:36.550
so maybe we should
just make the soup.

13:38.087 --> 13:39.754
Okay, you've chopped
that enough.

13:39.788 --> 13:41.656
Put a big handful
in the cheesecloth,

13:41.690 --> 13:44.425
and then tie it up
with this string.

13:44.459 --> 13:47.128
Put it in the soup.
It's an herb bouquet.

13:47.162 --> 13:50.665
And we can take it out before
we give it to her. Right.

13:52.701 --> 13:54.669
Why do you have
your dog tags on?

13:54.703 --> 13:56.671
Because I found
'em by my uniform

13:56.705 --> 14:00.041
when I was, uh, getting
dressed for the funeral.

14:00.075 --> 14:01.208
Jake.

14:01.243 --> 14:03.377
Why did he go back, justin?

14:03.411 --> 14:05.680
It breaks my heart
that he was there.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.314
Well, somebody has to be.

14:07.349 --> 14:09.350
Are you all right?

14:09.384 --> 14:11.218
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

14:11.253 --> 14:13.287
I know this hit you hard.

14:13.321 --> 14:16.290
Have you been going to your meetings?
Yes, mom, I've been going to my n.a.
Meetings.

14:16.324 --> 14:18.693
I'm... I'm fine, really.

14:18.727 --> 14:22.296
Then maybe you could
take your dog tags off.

14:22.330 --> 14:24.231
Okay. This is all done.

14:24.266 --> 14:26.500
So I'll just drop
it in the soup?

14:26.535 --> 14:28.836
Yeah.

14:28.871 --> 14:30.838
Cooper, you know the rules.

14:30.873 --> 14:33.841
No swimming without a grown-up.
Mom, I know how to swim.

14:33.876 --> 14:35.843
I just wanted to
do a cannonball.

14:35.878 --> 14:37.845
Listen, if you had hit your head

14:37.880 --> 14:39.847
and no one was there,
you would've drowned.

14:39.882 --> 14:42.850
And don't even get me started
about the whole clothes thing.

14:42.885 --> 14:44.786
oh. hey.

14:44.820 --> 14:47.354
Were you with him? Yeah,
I went to get him a towel.

14:47.389 --> 14:49.857
Luc, you said that you
would keep an eye on him

14:49.892 --> 14:52.359
while I got changed. Well, I was,
but he wanted to go swimming,

14:52.394 --> 14:54.361
so I went to pick
up his bathing suit

14:54.396 --> 14:57.531
and told him to wait by the pool.
Pfft. You took too long.

14:57.566 --> 15:00.367
What? Cooper, seriously?
You told me you would wait.

15:00.402 --> 15:02.904
How am I supposed to trust you
if you do things like that?

15:02.938 --> 15:04.806
What were you doing
outside anyway?

15:04.840 --> 15:07.308
You said that you would stay here,
play video games

15:07.342 --> 15:09.911
and stay out of trouble.
Cooper, my goodness.

15:09.945 --> 15:12.513
You're soaking wet. What,
did you fall in the pool? No, mom.

15:12.547 --> 15:15.850
He decided to go for a swim,
alone, with his clothes on.

15:15.884 --> 15:20.121
You're the one who told me to go
outside. I told you to go out and shoot
some baskets

15:20.155 --> 15:23.257
rather than sitting here and
shooting monsters all day.

15:23.291 --> 15:26.527
They're aliens.
Okay, that is enough from you.

15:26.561 --> 15:29.597
Go get changed.
I will deal with you later.

15:29.631 --> 15:31.498
Off you go.

15:33.902 --> 15:35.636
Look, mom, I told you...

15:35.670 --> 15:37.939
I know, sarah.
I know. You told me

15:37.973 --> 15:40.942
you like to use these games
as some kind of babysitter,

15:40.976 --> 15:42.944
but, honey, the one he's playing

15:42.978 --> 15:45.613
is the most violent game I have
ever seen. That is ridiculous.

15:45.647 --> 15:47.815
He's shooting blue blobs.

15:47.850 --> 15:50.384
You never minded when tommy
was playing with "duck hunt."

15:50.418 --> 15:51.886
"duck hunt"?

15:51.920 --> 15:54.722
Besides, it's a lot safer than
swimming in that pool alone.

15:54.757 --> 15:58.559
I didn't expect him to jump in the
pool fully clothed. Yeah, no one did.

15:58.593 --> 16:01.495
Sarah, I have to tell you,
I think this game is a problem.

16:01.529 --> 16:04.331
All of these games are a problem.
Oh, mom, stop.

16:04.366 --> 16:07.401
You told me yourself, he stapled
some girl's ponytail? He's a boy.

16:07.435 --> 16:10.371
He's a little aggressive. He needs an
outlet. Boys will be boys, is that it?

16:10.405 --> 16:13.674
Could you back me up here? I'm sorry,
sarah. I think your mom is right.

16:13.708 --> 16:16.010
Stop making excuses.

16:16.044 --> 16:18.913
Video games or not,
cooper has been acting out.

16:18.947 --> 16:22.049
Cooper is going through a bit
of a rough patch right now.

16:22.084 --> 16:25.052
I am doing the very best I can,
and I think the last thing

16:25.087 --> 16:28.055
that cooper needs is more cooks in the
kitchen. Well, you asked for my
opinion. I told you.

16:28.090 --> 16:29.690
Yeah, you did.

16:29.724 --> 16:32.126
If you two are finished
ganging up on me,

16:32.161 --> 16:34.162
i'm gonna go talk to my boy.

16:36.000 --> 16:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:43.133 --> 16:45.101
look at us... A couple
of men of leisure

16:45.135 --> 16:47.103
hitting some tennis balls
on a saturday afternoon.

16:47.137 --> 16:49.105
That's us. Feels weird to me,
you know...

16:49.139 --> 16:51.741
Scheduling my day around court
times and martini lunches,

16:51.775 --> 16:53.176
nowhere to report?

16:53.211 --> 16:55.178
Does it feel weird to you?

16:55.213 --> 16:57.681
No, but that's probably
'cause I still have my job

16:57.715 --> 16:59.182
as a united states senator.

16:59.217 --> 17:01.184
Go on. Get up there.
I'm serving.

17:01.219 --> 17:02.885
All right, these go.

17:12.730 --> 17:14.564
oh!

17:14.598 --> 17:16.733
yes! Sarah, that was on my side.

17:16.767 --> 17:18.734
I didn't think you had it.
I know how to play tennis.

17:18.769 --> 17:21.037
It's gonna be a long day.
Let's go, kev.

17:21.070 --> 17:23.740
Buck up. Here we go. I know technically,
you're still working.

17:23.773 --> 17:26.209
But what's next? I mean,
you don't have anything lined up?

17:26.243 --> 17:28.444
Don't worry.
I'll think of something.

17:28.479 --> 17:30.447
You're the most ambitious
person I'll ever know.

17:30.481 --> 17:32.949
That's why I can't figure
out why you're so cool

17:32.983 --> 17:35.652
playing tennis on a saturday afternoon.
Well, we all have to enjoy our lives.

17:35.686 --> 17:37.787
Love-15. Bring it on.

17:37.821 --> 17:40.757
¶ right down to the bone ¶

17:40.791 --> 17:42.292
yeah! Nice try, babe.

17:42.326 --> 17:44.261
Don't patronize me.
You know what?

17:44.295 --> 17:46.529
Maybe you're right.
I mean, why am I so high strung?

17:46.564 --> 17:49.599
If you can handle the easy life,
i'm sure I could.

17:49.634 --> 17:51.668
I just need to learn
how to chill. Right?

17:51.702 --> 17:55.272
You need to learn how
to play that net. Okay.

17:55.306 --> 17:56.973
15 all.

17:57.007 --> 17:58.608
¶ you might get away with it ¶

17:58.643 --> 18:02.512
¶ it's a risk,
it's a risk, yeah ¶

18:02.546 --> 18:05.915
¶ too big for my heart ¶

18:05.949 --> 18:08.518
oh! That's my partner!
Nice shot, kev.

18:08.552 --> 18:10.487
Thanks, rah. That's
what I'm talking about.

18:10.521 --> 18:12.756
You know what?
That did feel good.

18:12.790 --> 18:15.325
I should play more tennis.
Here we go.

18:15.359 --> 18:17.427
All right, kev.
Let's do it. All right.

18:17.461 --> 18:21.063
¶ a loss of the senses ¶

18:21.098 --> 18:24.066
ouch. I had it. It was my ball.

18:24.101 --> 18:26.736
Why don't you play singles?

18:26.771 --> 18:30.907
¶ they ride in your suit ¶

18:30.941 --> 18:33.209
aha! A point. Don't get cocky.

18:33.243 --> 18:35.412
Nice shot.

18:35.446 --> 18:37.447
¶ don't think, don't think ¶

18:37.481 --> 18:39.649
¶ don't talk, don't think ¶

18:39.684 --> 18:41.618
just out. What?

18:41.652 --> 18:43.586
No, no, no, no, no.
There is no way that was out.

18:43.621 --> 18:46.623
Well, it was too
close for me to call.

18:46.657 --> 18:48.591
I think it was out.
Yeah, well, of course you do.

18:48.626 --> 18:52.261
What is that supposed to mean? Luc,
come on. You question my tennis game,
my parenting.

18:52.296 --> 18:54.331
Maybe you and my mother
should play together,

18:54.365 --> 18:56.366
because it feels like
you two are in agreement

18:56.400 --> 18:58.635
about a lot of things lately. Sarah, I
think it was out. That's all I'm saying.

18:58.669 --> 19:01.003
You know what? Let me play forehand.
Hey, you know, I have an idea.

19:01.038 --> 19:03.506
You guys have such a great
history on the court.

19:03.541 --> 19:05.542
Why don't you guys
play together?

19:05.576 --> 19:07.644
And, luc, you come over here
for a minute. Fine by me.

19:07.678 --> 19:09.646
Works for me.
A thousand thank yous.

19:09.680 --> 19:11.448
You kidding me? Been there.

19:11.482 --> 19:14.517
And there's my move,
so it's your turn.

19:14.552 --> 19:17.019
aha. Which move will it be?

19:17.054 --> 19:20.490
There. You see? You really
have to think about this game.

19:20.524 --> 19:21.991
You have to strategize.

19:22.025 --> 19:24.961
You have to suss out your opponent.
There! I took you.

19:24.995 --> 19:26.963
I like "galactic
showdown" better.

19:26.997 --> 19:29.733
You fly space ships
and shoot bad guys,

19:29.767 --> 19:32.535
just like uncle
justin did in the war.

19:32.570 --> 19:34.571
It was so cool.
He saved his friend

19:34.605 --> 19:37.006
by dragging him
through the desert.

19:37.040 --> 19:39.976
And then there were
real-life helicopters.

19:40.010 --> 19:41.978
He got to jump out of one once.

19:42.012 --> 19:44.213
It was so cool.

19:44.248 --> 19:47.550
Yes, I know. He was very brave.

19:47.585 --> 19:50.387
Okay. There, it's your move.

19:50.421 --> 19:52.989
King me, grammy!

19:53.023 --> 19:55.658
I'm not going to king you.
You have to earn that.

19:55.693 --> 19:57.260
Don't you think?

19:57.294 --> 20:00.263
mmm. These biscotti are amazing.

20:00.297 --> 20:03.533
I feel like I'm sitting on a
piazza in florence. God, I'm good.

20:03.567 --> 20:05.602
oh. mmm.

20:05.636 --> 20:08.538
Hello, boys. Ooh,
working on our menu? Kevin...

20:08.572 --> 20:11.240
You have to taste these biscotti.
They're fantastic.

20:11.275 --> 20:13.710
I can't. I'm in training. I thought
you were working on contracts.

20:13.744 --> 20:15.545
Where have you been, wimbledon?

20:15.579 --> 20:18.615
Maybe next year.
I whizzed through my contracts,

20:18.649 --> 20:20.617
and then I tripped
the light fantastic

20:20.651 --> 20:22.619
at the altadena country club.
You're kidding.

20:22.653 --> 20:24.521
They let you back in
after the incident?

20:24.555 --> 20:26.523
Oh! That was one
stupid harassment suit

20:26.557 --> 20:28.591
from a disgruntled tennis pro.

20:28.626 --> 20:30.359
Oh, and guess what. What?

20:30.394 --> 20:32.395
Kevrah lives. Kevrah?

20:32.430 --> 20:35.231
Don't ask. You should've seen us
on the court today, uncle saul.

20:35.265 --> 20:37.867
Like riding a bicycle.
I was venus to sarah's serena.

20:37.902 --> 20:39.368
Were venus and serena drinking?

20:39.403 --> 20:42.204
'cause you seem very
relaxed all of a sudden.

20:42.239 --> 20:44.774
Mm. Actually, I did have a
glass of wine with lunch.

20:44.809 --> 20:47.777
You know what I've realized?
I've worked since I was 15.

20:47.812 --> 20:50.580
That's 23 years without a break.
And for what?

20:50.614 --> 20:52.649
Money. Yeah, and I'll work again,
but right now,

20:52.683 --> 20:54.918
no one's exactly beating
down the door to hire me.

20:54.952 --> 20:57.921
So you know what? This might
be a blessing in disguise.

20:57.955 --> 21:01.057
No one actually needs my help,
not even you guys. Oh, kevin, stop it.

21:01.091 --> 21:03.460
If you want to get involved
in the restaurant, you can.

21:03.494 --> 21:05.595
I just assumed that you... No,
no, no. That's your passion.

21:05.629 --> 21:08.598
Now I have my own passion.
Really? And what might that be?

21:08.632 --> 21:11.100
Tennis. So if you'd excuse me,
i'm gonna go and soak

21:11.134 --> 21:13.636
because I need to be
nice and loose and limber

21:13.671 --> 21:16.339
for my big game tomorrow.
Kevrah for match point.

21:16.373 --> 21:18.341
Walker serves. Aces.

21:18.375 --> 21:20.944
<i>Crowd goes wild.</i>

21:20.978 --> 21:23.947
Who knew unemployment
could be so much fun?

21:29.119 --> 21:30.252
hey.

21:30.287 --> 21:32.021
Hey. How did it go?

21:32.055 --> 21:33.923
Uh, okay.

21:33.958 --> 21:36.025
Okay. Good call on the,
uh, soup.

21:36.059 --> 21:39.161
She, uh, she really liked it.
Oh, good. I'm glad.

21:39.196 --> 21:41.364
ohh.

21:41.398 --> 21:42.932
So...

21:42.967 --> 21:45.267
Justin...

21:45.302 --> 21:47.003
Yeah.

21:47.037 --> 21:49.539
The house was amazing.
I mean, absolutely amazing.

21:49.573 --> 21:52.609
A huge backyard,
a swing on the front porch,

21:52.643 --> 21:55.011
built-ins in every room...
It was perfect.

21:55.045 --> 21:58.414
Cool. I'd really like for you
to come see it with me tonight.

21:58.448 --> 22:00.416
Uh, rebecca, listen,
I was kinda hoping

22:00.450 --> 22:03.252
we could just chill
and watch a movie.

22:03.286 --> 22:04.754
Okay, well, the thing is...

22:04.788 --> 22:06.789
I know I was supposed
to be window-shopping,

22:06.824 --> 22:08.791
that the money should be

22:08.826 --> 22:10.727
back in my account by monday,

22:10.761 --> 22:13.262
and there were other buyers
that were interested, so...

22:13.296 --> 22:17.567
I put an offer in. Wait.
You made an offer?

22:17.601 --> 22:19.669
We don't have to pay them anything.
Whoa. Time-out. Time...

22:19.703 --> 22:21.671
Rebecca, you made
an offer on a house

22:21.705 --> 22:24.908
that I haven't even set foot in yet? No,
I know. And, justin, obviously,

22:24.942 --> 22:27.510
if you don't like it,
we're not... We're not gonna buy it.

22:27.545 --> 22:30.246
I just want you to come and see
it with me. It's perfect and...

22:30.280 --> 22:32.515
This is crazy to me, rebecca. Well, I
don't understand. What is so crazy

22:32.550 --> 22:34.817
about us wanting to
buy a house together?

22:34.852 --> 22:37.186
I mean, I don't even know where this is
coming from. You know what? Fine. You
don't get it.

22:37.220 --> 22:39.589
Then it explain it to me,
because, justin, this morning,

22:39.623 --> 22:41.591
you said that you were fine

22:41.625 --> 22:44.193
and you seemed to be
dealing with this.

22:44.227 --> 22:46.629
So obviously, this is
hitting you a lot harder

22:46.664 --> 22:48.865
than you're willing to admit. Okay,
what do you want from me? All right?

22:48.899 --> 22:50.867
My friends are dying.
I'm having trouble thinking about

22:50.901 --> 22:52.902
houses and blenders.
All right? Justin, calm down.

22:52.937 --> 22:55.271
And the degree I'm gonna get
in seven years. Calm down.

22:55.305 --> 22:57.740
I'm sorry. I know that jake was
your friend, but think about it.

22:57.775 --> 23:00.877
The last thing he would want you
to do is stop living your life,

23:00.911 --> 23:02.545
and if you're trying

23:02.580 --> 23:05.214
to shame me into not wanting a
comfortable future with you,

23:05.248 --> 23:09.151
then... Then you're right, I don't
understand. All right. Fine. I-I have
nothing else to tell you.

23:15.807 --> 23:17.874
all right, let's stretch it out.

23:17.909 --> 23:20.877
I got you. Really feel it. There you
go. Okay, when I say "we are," you say
"champions."

23:20.912 --> 23:22.378
We are... Champions.

23:22.413 --> 23:23.880
We are... Champions.

23:23.915 --> 23:25.381
We are... Champions.

23:25.416 --> 23:27.484
You in this, sis? yep.

23:27.518 --> 23:30.153
You have to say it.
Oh, yeah, sorry. To win it, bro.

23:30.187 --> 23:32.055
All right. What's up?

23:32.089 --> 23:33.556
Cooper's play date canceled.

23:33.590 --> 23:35.558
Mom's bringing him
to watch the game.

23:35.592 --> 23:38.727
There is no way he's gonna sit still
that long. Sarah, she raised five of us.

23:38.762 --> 23:40.763
Yeah, but we didn't
have to deal with

23:40.797 --> 23:43.399
a strange frenchman moving into our
house. There was that one exchange
student.

23:43.434 --> 23:45.401
Look, she's, like,
the child whisperer, okay?

23:45.436 --> 23:48.171
Let her focus on cooper.
You focus on the match.

23:48.205 --> 23:49.672
We'll be fine. Okay.

23:49.706 --> 23:51.140
Okay?

23:51.175 --> 23:52.641
Go, team kevrah.

23:52.676 --> 23:55.445
Where are those guys?

23:55.479 --> 23:58.547
I don't know. You think we scared
them off yesterday? Robert? Doubtful.

24:06.823 --> 24:08.691
Senator.

24:08.725 --> 24:11.461
Bill stanton. Good to meet you.

24:11.495 --> 24:13.896
It's a beautiful day for a good cause,
wouldn't you say?

24:13.930 --> 24:16.799
Yeah, I'm... Just happy
to be here to help out.

24:16.833 --> 24:18.301
Yeah, you know,

24:18.335 --> 24:20.303
I was sorry to hear you're not
running for reelection. Ah.

24:20.337 --> 24:22.038
You got a line on what's next?

24:22.072 --> 24:24.140
That's sort of the
$1-million question.

24:24.174 --> 24:26.042
Well, don't tell me it's golf.

24:26.076 --> 24:28.911
That'd be a prime waste
of national resources.

24:28.945 --> 24:31.680
Well, now, now. You should wait
until you see my short game

24:31.715 --> 24:33.182
before you say that.

24:33.217 --> 24:35.885
Well, maybe we
should play sometime.

24:35.919 --> 24:38.687
Maybe we should.

24:38.722 --> 24:41.724
It's a nice club you have here.

24:41.758 --> 24:43.893
You're not a member, are you?

24:43.927 --> 24:45.895
No, no. I'm surprised
they let me in at all.

24:45.929 --> 24:48.498
I think I've passed bills
with less paperwork. Yeah.

24:48.532 --> 24:50.900
Well, sorry about that.

24:50.934 --> 24:53.236
Bureaucracy, right? Indeed.

24:53.270 --> 24:55.238
Well, next time, call me up.

24:55.272 --> 24:57.106
I'll walk you straight in.

24:57.141 --> 25:01.044
Or I could join.

25:01.078 --> 25:03.046
I'd be glad to sponsor you.

25:03.080 --> 25:05.714
Here.

25:05.749 --> 25:08.784
Try my cell if you're
interested. Thank you.

25:10.421 --> 25:13.122
Pleasure, senator.

25:18.162 --> 25:20.196
I don't want to watch tennis.

25:20.230 --> 25:23.199
Why couldn't I have just stayed
home with evan and his nanny?

25:23.233 --> 25:25.368
It's gonna be fun.
Hold on. Hold on.

25:25.402 --> 25:28.371
I want to put more block on your nose.
Here. Mom. You already lathered him up
in the car.

25:28.405 --> 25:30.573
It's hot out.
I missed his nose, justin.

25:30.607 --> 25:34.009
All right, never mind.
Just wear this.

25:34.044 --> 25:35.578
How's that? no.

25:35.612 --> 25:38.481
You know, I wore a hat
every day in iraq.

25:38.515 --> 25:40.483
You did?

25:40.517 --> 25:43.419
Mm-hmm. Everybody did.
That's awesome.

25:43.454 --> 25:46.789
Did you also tell him you ended
up in a hospital in germany?

25:51.295 --> 25:52.761
All right. Call it.

25:52.796 --> 25:55.598
No need. You can serve.

25:58.868 --> 26:00.436
Okay.

26:00.471 --> 26:02.972
So they have a great bar here.

26:03.006 --> 26:05.808
What do you want me to do?
I ran into him.

26:05.842 --> 26:08.811
When it comes to bill stanton?
Be rude and ignore him.

26:08.845 --> 26:11.514
He's the host. It's his charity event.
Right. So write a check.

26:11.548 --> 26:13.949
Don't schmooze with the
prince of darkness, okay?

26:13.984 --> 26:16.719
I mean, what did he want,
help on votes for a contract?

26:16.753 --> 26:18.954
We were talking about golf.
I just hope no one got a picture,

26:18.989 --> 26:21.957
'cause that would be bad publicity. I
thought you didn't work for me anymore.

26:21.992 --> 26:23.959
For kitty, I mean.
But you're right.

26:23.994 --> 26:26.229
I don't work at all.
So let's play tennis.

26:26.263 --> 26:28.797
<i> Mccallister and laurent to serve,
first set.</i>

26:31.268 --> 26:32.435
ah.

26:32.469 --> 26:35.271
<i>Ooh. Nice serve. 15-love.</i>

26:35.305 --> 26:37.640
Where the hell did that
come from? Lucky shot.

26:37.674 --> 26:41.244
That wasn't a lucky shot.
That was an ace. Hey.

26:41.278 --> 26:44.113
Sorry rebecca couldn't
come today. Yeah.

26:44.148 --> 26:47.716
Is she busy? Uh, yeah, yeah, she was.
Hey, coop, while you're in there,

26:47.751 --> 26:49.885
you want to grab me a granola bar,
buddy? Okay.

26:49.919 --> 26:52.622
<i>Out. 15 all. yes.</i>

26:52.656 --> 26:54.290
Grandma? Yeah.

26:54.324 --> 26:56.292
Why do you have an umbrella?
Shh. It's, um,

26:56.326 --> 26:58.727
it's not for the rain.
It's for the sun.

26:58.762 --> 27:01.897
It's like your hat,
only bigger, way bigger.

27:01.931 --> 27:04.534
Cooper, stop it.
I'm just shooting luc.

27:04.568 --> 27:06.536
<i>15-30.</i>

27:06.570 --> 27:09.472
Justin, would you
grab that from him?

27:09.506 --> 27:12.041
You're the one who started it.
What did I do?

27:12.075 --> 27:14.577
You think he got the idea
to turn that into a gun

27:14.611 --> 27:16.879
all by himself? Uh, yes, mom.
He's a boy.

27:16.913 --> 27:19.048
You take away the umbrella,
he'll use a stick.

27:19.082 --> 27:21.584
You take away the stick,
he'll use his hand.

27:21.618 --> 27:23.419
I had nothing to do with it.

27:23.453 --> 27:25.655
I'm gonna get a soda. Would you
like anything? No, thank you.

27:25.689 --> 27:27.723
You should really
knock that off.

27:30.260 --> 27:33.162
Cooper, stop it.

27:33.197 --> 27:35.164
<i>30 all.</i>

27:35.199 --> 27:37.032
Hi, honey.

27:37.067 --> 27:39.101
How did you miss that? Sorry,
I got distracted.

27:39.135 --> 27:41.370
Kevrah was undefeated
in 17 years, okay?

27:41.405 --> 27:44.507
I'd like to keep it that way.

27:53.950 --> 27:56.051
oh. Nice shot.

27:56.086 --> 27:58.621
<i>40-30.</i>

27:58.655 --> 28:01.290
Cooper, stop it. Cooper. Cooper.

28:01.325 --> 28:03.125
Cooper, what are you doing?

28:03.159 --> 28:06.061
Cooper. I'll handle this.
He's throwing balls at the court.

28:06.096 --> 28:08.897
This is not cool. Listen, you talking
to him now is only gonna make things
worse.

28:08.932 --> 28:11.800
They're not gonna get any better if you
keep butting in. What? He's my son.

28:11.835 --> 28:15.605
<i>Yes, he is. And where do i fit in?
Look, I don't know, but he already has
a father,</i>

28:15.639 --> 28:18.107
who, by the way, is not
exactly thrilled about you,

28:18.141 --> 28:20.309
and obviously,
neither is cooper.

28:20.344 --> 28:23.346
I'm stuck in the middle. I'm trying to
figure it out. Well, you let me know
when you do.

28:23.380 --> 28:26.048
Till then, we're not gonna
be able to play as a team.

28:26.082 --> 28:28.951
Coop. Cooper. My... Sorry.
It was an accident.

28:32.822 --> 28:34.357
Okay...

28:34.391 --> 28:37.627
Listen to me,
that was no accident.

28:37.661 --> 28:40.229
The corkscrew,
the swimming pool, this...

28:40.264 --> 28:43.198
None of it was an accident,
was it, cooper?

28:43.233 --> 28:45.735
Hmm? Okay, you're
coming home with me.

28:45.769 --> 28:49.037
Oh, I... Mom,
this is my job, not yours.

28:49.072 --> 28:51.140
Sorry, kevin. We gotta forfeit.

28:51.174 --> 28:52.975
What? Get outta here.

28:53.009 --> 28:54.644
ow!

28:57.213 --> 28:58.481
hey.

28:58.515 --> 28:59.815
hey.

28:59.849 --> 29:01.317
Come on. We're leaving.

29:01.351 --> 29:03.852
What, already? Who...
Who won the match?

29:03.887 --> 29:06.088
No one. It was a forfeit.
Come on.

29:06.122 --> 29:07.657
Well, where is cooper?

29:07.691 --> 29:09.992
He's with sarah, so let's go.

29:10.026 --> 29:12.561
What, you know what? Time-out.
What... What's the deal?

29:12.596 --> 29:14.930
Are you mad at me or something?

29:14.964 --> 29:18.467
No, I'm not mad at you.
I'm onto you, justin.

29:18.502 --> 29:22.204
Wh... You're on... The funeral, the dog
tags, all these war stories to cooper...

29:22.238 --> 29:24.139
I know where this is headed.

29:24.174 --> 29:27.142
Don't put words in my mouth. You want
to go back to this hideous war.

29:27.177 --> 29:30.245
I don't want to go back, mom. I just
want to... Don't lie to me, justin.

29:30.280 --> 29:32.247
I've been through this before.
You went there twice.

29:32.282 --> 29:34.249
The last time almost killed you.

29:34.284 --> 29:36.385
Why would you go back?

29:36.420 --> 29:38.421
Your life is great.
You're in med school.

29:38.455 --> 29:41.357
You have a wife who loves you. Yeah,
and I love her, too, mom, and there's
noth...

29:41.391 --> 29:43.359
You made a commitment
to stay with her.

29:43.393 --> 29:45.761
You can't walk away
from your life, justin.

29:45.796 --> 29:47.830
You can't.

30:06.615 --> 30:08.816
mm.

30:08.851 --> 30:10.985
that feels good.

30:11.019 --> 30:13.721
Wow. Andy roddick
passed out on my couch.

30:13.755 --> 30:16.858
Roger federer's a better player.

30:16.892 --> 30:18.960
Yeah, but roddick is cuter.

30:18.994 --> 30:21.228
Oh, I'm flattered.
But we both lost the big game.

30:21.262 --> 30:24.264
Well, I bet you played
hard and gave it your all.

30:24.299 --> 30:27.401
Why are you being so nice to me?

30:27.435 --> 30:29.403
Maybe I feel guilty.

30:29.437 --> 30:30.905
I haven't exactly

30:30.939 --> 30:32.974
been paying attention
to you lately.

30:33.008 --> 30:37.277
That's all right.
I'm not a child.

30:37.312 --> 30:40.314
Although I have been
behaving like one recently.

30:41.683 --> 30:44.485
We're having a baby
in seven months.

30:44.520 --> 30:47.154
I need to get a job, any job.

30:47.188 --> 30:48.723
It's not about the job.

30:48.757 --> 30:51.258
Okay, I need to make money.

30:51.292 --> 30:53.260
It's not really about
the money either.

30:53.294 --> 30:55.462
You need a purpose.

30:55.497 --> 30:56.898
And it's not tennis.

30:56.932 --> 31:00.234
Can we just leave all
the purpose to you,

31:00.268 --> 31:01.903
just for a moment?

31:01.937 --> 31:05.606
I really want you to
open this restaurant.

31:05.641 --> 31:08.242
Maybe that's my purpose,
encouraging you.

31:08.276 --> 31:10.745
Do you know what I miss?

31:10.779 --> 31:12.479
What?

31:12.514 --> 31:14.448
The old kevin walker...

31:14.482 --> 31:17.084
Who ran towards his purpose.

31:17.118 --> 31:20.087
So why am I running
away from it now?

31:20.121 --> 31:22.456
Because you don't
know what it is

31:22.490 --> 31:25.159
and you hate uncertainty.

31:27.495 --> 31:29.496
At least i'm certain of you.

31:34.002 --> 31:36.971
Now I know we talked
about luc moving in,

31:37.005 --> 31:39.506
and you were excited
about the idea of it.

31:39.541 --> 31:42.342
But now there's a whole
new member of the family,

31:42.377 --> 31:45.279
and we think you might be
finding it a bit challenging.

31:45.313 --> 31:46.781
hmm?

31:46.815 --> 31:48.983
It's different than
what I expected.

31:50.586 --> 31:52.152
I get that.

31:52.187 --> 31:54.689
You know, for me, too.

31:54.723 --> 31:56.457
But he's here now,

31:56.491 --> 31:59.326
so it's time that
we all learn...

31:59.360 --> 32:01.328
How we're gonna get along.

32:01.362 --> 32:02.830
Now I love luc, okay?

32:02.864 --> 32:05.700
So when you hurt his feelings,
you hurt my feelings,

32:05.734 --> 32:08.535
the same way that I'd be
hurt if somebody hurt you.

32:08.570 --> 32:10.537
You know what I'm talking about?

32:10.572 --> 32:12.673
yes. Good.

32:12.708 --> 32:16.043
So do you have something you
might want to say to luc?

32:16.078 --> 32:18.846
I'm sorry, luc.

32:18.880 --> 32:21.682
Thank you, cooper.

32:21.717 --> 32:24.184
Okay, now you go
brush your teeth,

32:24.219 --> 32:25.686
start a chapter,

32:25.721 --> 32:27.688
and I'll be in to
tuck you in, okay?

32:27.723 --> 32:29.890
I love you. Mwah.

32:38.466 --> 32:40.400
Nicely done.

32:40.435 --> 32:42.336
Thank you.

32:42.370 --> 32:44.338
I wonder if he's upset

32:44.372 --> 32:47.508
that he's not the man
of the house anymore.

32:47.542 --> 32:49.510
You know, he used to...

32:49.544 --> 32:52.980
Come and cuddle and
fall asleep and...

32:53.015 --> 32:55.182
He always had me all to himself.

32:58.120 --> 33:02.489
Speaking of cuddling...

33:05.127 --> 33:07.427
You know, I don't think cooper

33:07.462 --> 33:09.463
is the only problem here.

33:09.497 --> 33:13.134
I think you need to deal
with your own issues.

33:13.168 --> 33:15.502
You're right.

33:15.537 --> 33:17.705
I'm so sorry.

33:20.375 --> 33:22.576
Okay, here's the deal...

33:22.610 --> 33:25.312
What if the only reason
we've been deliriously happy

33:25.346 --> 33:27.314
is because we've been
living in a fantasy?

33:27.348 --> 33:29.016
And now it's... Real.

33:29.051 --> 33:30.350
Yeah.

33:30.385 --> 33:32.286
Real is good, right?

33:32.320 --> 33:35.189
Real is real. It's paint colors
and temper tantrums and...

33:35.223 --> 33:37.858
And the emotional
lives of 8 year olds.

33:37.893 --> 33:39.860
I don't want to
mess this up, luc.

33:39.895 --> 33:42.863
For me, this is...
This is a huge deal.

33:42.898 --> 33:44.865
And it's a huge
deal for me, too.

33:44.900 --> 33:48.268
I want to be a family with you.

33:48.303 --> 33:50.071
But you think cooper's tough?

33:50.105 --> 33:52.073
Try living with a
13-year-old girl

33:52.107 --> 33:53.574
who hates you.

33:53.608 --> 33:55.910
You're so relaxed about it.

33:55.944 --> 33:57.912
I don't think you really
have thought through

33:57.946 --> 34:00.447
the stress that children
put on a relationship.

34:00.481 --> 34:03.184
What if it's just too hard?

34:03.218 --> 34:07.054
Now I can deal with
you breaking my heart.

34:07.089 --> 34:10.657
But I can't deal with
you breaking theirs.

34:16.898 --> 34:18.933
I'm not gonna break
anyone's heart.

34:18.967 --> 34:22.203
But we don't know that,
do we? I love you, sarah.

34:22.237 --> 34:24.938
And I'm not trying to be
their father or anything.

34:24.973 --> 34:28.408
No, I know. But do you
know who you do want to b

34:28.443 --> 34:30.143
your partner,

34:30.178 --> 34:32.980
a very positive role
model for the kids.

34:33.014 --> 34:34.681
And for that,

34:34.716 --> 34:38.619
i'm gonna need to have my
own relationship with them.

34:42.157 --> 34:46.092
Then we are very,
very, very lucky.

34:55.570 --> 34:57.938
Hello. hi.

34:57.973 --> 35:00.741
What have you got there? Oh,
I just wanted to thank you

35:00.776 --> 35:03.610
for taking care of evan for so long.
Oh, don't be silly.

35:03.645 --> 35:05.612
I'm his grandmother. I love it.

35:05.647 --> 35:08.249
Oh, I know.
That's why it's not cash.

35:08.283 --> 35:09.784
Oh. Well, thank you.

35:09.818 --> 35:11.285
Sure.

35:11.319 --> 35:14.554
So, um... He's asleep in
the living room right now

35:14.589 --> 35:16.056
in his playpen thingy.

35:16.091 --> 35:18.592
The nanny left right after
we got back from the game.

35:18.626 --> 35:21.162
I'm just packing up all of
his stuff right now. Okay.

35:23.265 --> 35:26.200
Robert, can I ask you something?

35:26.234 --> 35:27.567
Sure.

35:27.602 --> 35:29.569
Did justin talk to you

35:29.604 --> 35:31.906
about wanting to go
back to afghanistan?

35:33.975 --> 35:35.810
Oh, god. He did.

35:35.844 --> 35:37.812
Look, nora...

35:37.846 --> 35:41.248
Oh, please tell me you didn't
say anything to encourage him.

35:41.283 --> 35:42.883
No, I just listened.

35:42.918 --> 35:45.552
To what?

35:47.622 --> 35:49.589
Nora, the first time you enlist,

35:49.624 --> 35:51.591
it can be about a
bunch of things.

35:51.626 --> 35:55.062
But if you reenlist,
it's personal.

35:55.096 --> 35:57.898
It's about wanting to get
back to people who you love

35:57.933 --> 36:01.802
and who understand you in a way
that nobody else possibly can.

36:01.837 --> 36:04.905
Oh, that's easy for you to say.
You're not going back to war.

36:04.940 --> 36:07.341
Well, we all go to war
in different ways.

36:07.375 --> 36:10.344
But I don't want my son to go
back to this war ever again.

36:10.378 --> 36:12.980
I understand.

36:13.014 --> 36:15.482
But that pull is awfully strong.

36:17.518 --> 36:19.519
And that's your son.

36:19.554 --> 36:22.689
Maybe you want to
go take care of him.

36:41.096 --> 36:43.598
Oh, hey. Oh, my gosh.

36:43.633 --> 36:45.600
You would not believe
the traffic out there.

36:45.635 --> 36:48.703
The 101 is... Is
bumper-to-bumper ridiculous.

36:48.737 --> 36:51.506
Where's the little guy? Oh,
he's... He's...

36:51.541 --> 36:54.342
Oh, shoot. Just got him down.

36:54.377 --> 36:57.312
So... No, no, no.

36:57.346 --> 37:00.348
First of all, just tell me,
who won the match? Oh, luc and I won.

37:00.383 --> 37:03.185
You're kidding me?
You beat kevrah?

37:03.219 --> 37:05.453
Yes, in a forfeit.
Wait a minute...

37:05.488 --> 37:07.522
Cooper had a meltdown,
so sarah had to leave.

37:07.557 --> 37:09.157
oh.

37:09.192 --> 37:11.459
so?

37:11.494 --> 37:13.961
So...

37:13.996 --> 37:16.665
Here's to my endorsements.

37:16.699 --> 37:19.467
I got 'em both.
That is fantastic.

37:19.502 --> 37:22.237
It was a long shot,
but I worked my magic,

37:22.271 --> 37:25.340
and as soon as hix caved,
I called mccarty and...

37:25.374 --> 37:28.343
It's like I always say.
What? What do you always say?

37:28.377 --> 37:31.913
Never bet against my wife.

37:31.947 --> 37:34.282
Oh. Mm.

37:34.317 --> 37:36.284
So how was the rest
of your weekend?

37:36.319 --> 37:39.287
Anything important?
Nothing to tell.

37:40.889 --> 37:43.791
Rebecca. Hello?

37:51.434 --> 37:53.401
hey.

37:53.436 --> 37:54.769
hey.

37:54.803 --> 37:56.771
¶ it can be a real long road ¶

37:56.805 --> 37:58.806
i, uh, I've been calling you.

37:58.841 --> 38:01.610
Yeah, I just needed to get out
of the house so I took a run.

38:01.644 --> 38:04.446
At night? That's a little,
uh, unsafe.

38:04.480 --> 38:06.615
Good thing I have
reflectors on my shoes.

38:06.649 --> 38:08.383
oh.

38:08.417 --> 38:10.418
¶ when you're on your own ¶

38:10.453 --> 38:12.820
you want to talk?

38:12.855 --> 38:16.891
You know what, justin?
I think you should do the talking.

38:16.925 --> 38:19.261
I don't know how to help you.

38:19.295 --> 38:21.229
Okay.

38:22.831 --> 38:26.334
¶ it can be a real long ride ¶

38:26.369 --> 38:29.137
rebecca, ever since the funeral,

38:29.171 --> 38:30.805
I've been thinking about

38:30.839 --> 38:34.376
how much jake and the
other guys mean to me.

38:34.410 --> 38:36.511
And it's so much more

38:36.545 --> 38:40.282
than anything that's going
on in my life right now.

38:40.316 --> 38:42.884
See, i, um...

38:44.720 --> 38:47.689
I don't think I want
to be a doctor anymore.

38:47.723 --> 38:49.691
It just... It
doesn't feel right.

38:49.725 --> 38:51.693
You know, it's all
about being the best

38:51.727 --> 38:54.095
and... And not a team.

38:54.129 --> 38:57.666
And... There's one place

38:57.700 --> 39:01.803
where I felt like I
belonged to a team...

39:01.837 --> 39:04.739
Where guys had my back.

39:04.774 --> 39:07.776
Don't. Don't you dare.
No, no, look, let me talk, all right?

39:07.810 --> 39:09.277
Just because I'm feeling it

39:09.312 --> 39:12.213
doesn't mean I'm gonna act upon it,
okay? So talk.

39:12.247 --> 39:15.317
¶ don't hold back ¶

39:15.351 --> 39:17.919
i'm not happy.
What? Is it me or...

39:17.953 --> 39:20.121
No, no. Is it the house?

39:20.155 --> 39:22.624
No, no, it's... Justin,
i'm sorry I got so excited.

39:22.658 --> 39:26.127
I mean, that house would mean nothing
to me without you in it. Rebecca, you
don't have to explain all that, okay?

39:26.161 --> 39:29.130
'cause you are the only
thing that works in my life.

39:29.164 --> 39:31.132
You are the one true thing.

39:31.166 --> 39:33.468
¶... Where you end ¶

39:33.502 --> 39:36.471
I just want to feel...

39:36.505 --> 39:40.642
Like I belong
somewhere else, too.

39:40.676 --> 39:44.212
¶ when I'm looking
in your eyes ¶

39:44.246 --> 39:46.381
and you will.

39:46.415 --> 39:50.652
¶ give me just one more chance ¶

39:50.686 --> 39:53.488
come here.

39:53.522 --> 39:55.490
mom.

39:55.524 --> 39:58.259
I'm leaving. Mom?

39:58.293 --> 40:01.095
Are you trapped under
something heavy?

40:01.129 --> 40:03.331
no.

40:05.668 --> 40:07.836
mom?

40:07.870 --> 40:10.638
¶ don't hold back ¶

40:10.673 --> 40:12.640
what are you doing in here?

40:12.675 --> 40:14.743
Nothing.

40:14.777 --> 40:16.244
¶ when the time is right ¶

40:16.278 --> 40:18.179
you're alone in the pantry.

40:18.213 --> 40:20.515
What is it?

40:20.549 --> 40:23.918
If you're upset about
me and luc, don't be.

40:23.952 --> 40:26.621
We had a really good
chat last night.

40:26.655 --> 40:29.123
We're gonna be fine.
It's not that, is it?

40:29.157 --> 40:32.159
No. I... I was just thinking.

40:32.194 --> 40:35.129
Oh. Okay.

40:35.163 --> 40:37.098
Sarah. hmm?

40:37.132 --> 40:39.467
I want to tell you something.

40:39.502 --> 40:42.771
Motherhood never gets easier,
even when they're grown.

40:42.805 --> 40:45.339
No one ever told me that,
and I...

40:45.374 --> 40:48.175
I just wanted to make sure I-
I told you.

40:48.210 --> 40:50.578
Thanks, mom.

40:50.613 --> 40:52.847
Hiya! Hiya!

40:52.882 --> 40:55.283
What the hell is that? Oh,
you gotta see this.

40:55.317 --> 40:57.285
It might even cheer
you up. Come.

40:57.319 --> 40:59.320
Hiya! Hiya! Hiya!

40:59.354 --> 41:01.456
Hiya! Hiya! Hiya!

41:01.490 --> 41:04.125
So you must visualize the attack

41:04.159 --> 41:06.127
and use the move
to defend yourself.

41:06.161 --> 41:07.462
Hiya! Hiya!

41:09.331 --> 41:11.599
Hiya! Hiya! Hiya!
Hiya! Hiya. Hiya.

41:11.634 --> 41:12.767
Hiya! Hiya!

41:12.802 --> 41:15.069
Hiya!

41:15.103 --> 41:17.605
<i>Osu. Osu.</i>

41:17.640 --> 41:19.741
Good job. What are they doing?

41:19.775 --> 41:22.677
Good job. Keep practicing.
Having their own relationship.

41:22.711 --> 41:24.178
Again.

41:24.212 --> 41:27.014
Hiya! Hiya!

41:27.049 --> 41:29.183
Hiya! Hiya!
