00:08.754 --> 00:11.712
( theme music playing )

00:39.837 --> 00:41.837
( women grunting )

01:21.003 --> 01:23.420
( both grunting, panting )

02:07.795 --> 02:10.920
( buzzer blares )

02:10.920 --> 02:13.503
( panting )

02:25.670 --> 02:28.003
Commentator:
That was a good
low takedown for Gaines.

02:28.003 --> 02:29.879
- Not a bad move for Greta,
a woman of her age.
- ( neck cracking )

02:29.879 --> 02:32.211
Commentator #2:
Yeah, she's hanging in there.

02:32.211 --> 02:34.337
Commentator: She's still
protecting that left side,
though, Greg, you know?

02:34.337 --> 02:36.503
I wonder if she came back
a little too early
from that injury.

02:36.503 --> 02:38.462
- What do you think, man?
- ( laughs ) How long
is she gonna wait?

02:38.462 --> 02:40.670
At her age, she's probably
only got a few fights left

02:40.670 --> 02:42.837
before they send her
off to the glue factory,
you know what I'm saying?

02:42.837 --> 02:44.378
- Commentator: Jesus, Greg!
- ( phone buzzing )

02:44.378 --> 02:46.128
Commentator #2:
What? I'm sorry.

02:50.795 --> 02:52.503
- Hey.
- Man over phone:
Hey, how's my girl?

02:52.503 --> 02:53.879
Are you ready?

02:53.879 --> 02:55.337
I'm nervous as shit.

02:55.337 --> 02:57.211
Nah, nah,
you're gonna be great.

02:57.211 --> 02:59.253
Did they even fix my name
on the marquee yet?

02:59.253 --> 03:02.378
Oh, yeah, they--
yeah, they're working on it.

03:02.378 --> 03:05.045
What about
the hotel mix-up?

03:05.045 --> 03:08.378
Yeah, you know,
they, uh-- they haven't
called me back yet.

03:08.378 --> 03:10.211
- So I gotta--
- Jesus, JR.

03:10.211 --> 03:12.337
What? What are you
so pissy about?

03:12.337 --> 03:14.170
It's supposed to be
my big shot.

03:14.170 --> 03:16.295
I'm the fucking headline
on this fight tomorrow night,

03:16.295 --> 03:17.545
and they're supposed
to put me in a--

03:17.545 --> 03:19.086
what did they call it
in the contract?

03:19.086 --> 03:20.961
- Four-star hotel.
- That's right.

03:20.961 --> 03:23.503
A four-star hotel,
and this is the shithole
that they put me in.

03:23.503 --> 03:25.337
Yeah, and that's why I said
if it's really bad,

03:25.337 --> 03:27.420
then we'll move you
and deal with them later, okay?

03:27.420 --> 03:30.003
- No, no, it's not about that.
- Okay, okay--

03:30.003 --> 03:32.587
It's about them showing me
some fucking respect, JR.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.253
Okay, I got it,
all right?

03:34.253 --> 03:36.670
Do you really-- do you...
( sighs )

03:36.670 --> 03:38.754
- What?
- Is it really worth
freaking out like this?

03:38.754 --> 03:41.295
Well, you know Rayna Gold's
getting her fucking
four-star hotel.

03:41.295 --> 03:43.337
I fucking know for a fact
that she is not, okay?

03:43.337 --> 03:45.337
You need to be
focusing on the fight
and get some sleep.

03:45.337 --> 03:47.420
No, what's Rayna making
on this fucking fight?

03:47.420 --> 03:49.712
You know she's making more
than the six grand
that I'm making.

03:49.712 --> 03:52.587
You know, six grand
is not a bad wage
for a day's work.

03:52.587 --> 03:54.961
"Not a bad wage
for a day's work"?

03:54.961 --> 03:58.920
Dude, I can fight,
what, four times a year?
That's $24,000.

03:58.920 --> 04:01.754
And that's before
I have to pay you
and my fucking medical bills,

04:01.754 --> 04:04.629
so don't fucking tell me, JR,
how well I'm paid.

04:04.629 --> 04:06.712
All right, fine!
I-- all right,
I'm sorry.

04:06.712 --> 04:09.045
- Calm down.
- I will not
fucking calm down!

04:09.045 --> 04:11.754
I wanna stay in the same
fucking kind of goddamn hotel

04:11.754 --> 04:13.211
that Rayna Gold's
fucking staying in!

04:13.211 --> 04:16.961
You are in the same hotel
as Rayna Gold.

04:16.961 --> 04:18.670
She's in
this fucking hotel?

04:18.670 --> 04:19.961
Yes! Yes!

04:19.961 --> 04:21.587
Well, why the fuck
would they put us

04:21.587 --> 04:23.420
in the same goddamn hotel
the night before we fight?

04:23.420 --> 04:25.503
Jesus, Greta,
I don't fucking know!

04:25.503 --> 04:26.961
I-- I don't know
what to tell you.

04:26.961 --> 04:29.253
- Just deal with it.
- ( sighs )

04:29.253 --> 04:30.879
If you wanna
blow up your career

04:30.879 --> 04:32.629
and you wanna bitch out
some upper-level executive

04:32.629 --> 04:35.670
about a hotel booking,
then be my guest.

04:35.670 --> 04:37.920
Thanks a lot, JR.
You're the fucking best.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.503
I guess I'll see you
tomorrow.

04:39.503 --> 04:40.961
- Good ni--
- ( hangs up )

04:43.961 --> 04:47.128
( exhales )

05:02.837 --> 05:04.712
( line ringing )

05:04.712 --> 05:07.170
- Woman over phone: Front desk.
- Rayna Gold's room, please.

05:07.170 --> 05:10.211
- Uh, can you
repeat the name?
- Rayna Gold.

05:10.211 --> 05:13.503
No, we don't have
any guest here under that name.

05:13.503 --> 05:16.587
Uh, Carol Jackson.

05:16.587 --> 05:18.378
One moment, please.

05:19.503 --> 05:21.295
( line ringing )

05:22.670 --> 05:24.295
( sighs )

05:37.128 --> 05:38.961
Rayna over phone:
Hello?

05:38.961 --> 05:41.670
So they put you
in this shithole, too, huh?

05:41.670 --> 05:43.211
The fuck do you want?

05:44.462 --> 05:45.795
We need to talk.

05:45.795 --> 05:48.045
( knocking on door )

06:01.337 --> 06:03.920
What makes you think
I'm making more?

06:03.920 --> 06:06.961
Well, you got more experience,
your record's better.

06:06.961 --> 06:09.045
I gotta think that
all that shit adds up.

06:10.253 --> 06:11.754
( scoffs )

06:15.337 --> 06:17.503
( scoffs )

06:17.503 --> 06:19.378
Six grand.

06:19.378 --> 06:22.587
With a six-grand
win bonus

06:22.587 --> 06:25.253
- after I beat your ass.
- Dude, no, fuck that.

06:25.253 --> 06:28.420
How many people do you think
are gonna be there
tomorrow night?

06:28.420 --> 06:30.420
People bought the tickets.
They're expensive.

06:30.420 --> 06:32.629
People watching
the livestream.

06:32.629 --> 06:34.545
All the merchandise
they're gonna sell.

06:34.545 --> 06:36.961
We don't fucking see
any of that shit.

06:36.961 --> 06:39.462
Getting our heads
busted the fuck in
for what?

06:43.545 --> 06:45.337
All right,
I'm going to sleep.

06:45.337 --> 06:47.170
I don't know
what the fuck you're--

06:47.170 --> 06:48.795
Tell me it doesn't
bother you.

06:48.795 --> 06:51.170
Yeah, that shit
bothers me.

06:51.170 --> 06:53.837
But what the fuck else
am I supposed to do?

06:53.837 --> 06:57.420
I got kids.
I gotta put food
on the table, man.

06:57.420 --> 06:59.587
What are we
supposed to do?

07:02.503 --> 07:04.295
( sighs )

07:05.629 --> 07:07.795
We call Martha Simms.

07:10.462 --> 07:12.629
You know,
Martha Simms.

07:12.629 --> 07:14.462
That old-ass,
rich white lady?

07:14.462 --> 07:16.587
Okay, hear me out.

07:16.587 --> 07:19.253
Everybody is making money
in this business

07:19.253 --> 07:20.837
but the fighters,
right?

07:20.837 --> 07:23.503
We can't change that
'cause the system
is fucked.

07:24.961 --> 07:26.670
But we can try
and beat it.

07:28.629 --> 07:29.837
How?

07:31.712 --> 07:33.961
'Cause we're gonna
throw the fight.

07:35.795 --> 07:37.253
We're gonna throw it,

07:37.253 --> 07:39.587
and we're gonna make
a ton of money doing it.

07:48.879 --> 07:50.795
( both panting )

07:52.837 --> 07:54.670
( exhales )

07:54.670 --> 07:56.170
Damn, man!

07:56.170 --> 07:57.961
I said watch
the fucking punches.

07:57.961 --> 08:00.587
Yeah, well, you were the one
fucking smashing my face
into the carpet

08:00.587 --> 08:02.670
like a fucking
cheese grater.

08:02.670 --> 08:04.420
I'm just sayin'.

08:04.420 --> 08:06.337
Yeah, well,
I'm just sayin'.

08:17.754 --> 08:19.170
( phone beeps )

08:22.337 --> 08:25.086
- ( grunts )
- Oh, shit!
I didn't mean--!

08:37.587 --> 08:39.712
( groaning )

08:50.712 --> 08:52.045
( grunting )

08:59.337 --> 09:01.378
( glass shatters )

09:16.003 --> 09:17.795
- ( grunts )
- Fuck!

09:17.795 --> 09:19.587
You split
my fucking face!

09:19.587 --> 09:22.253
Yeah, well,
you started that shit
with the fucking uppercut!

09:52.253 --> 09:54.837
( buzzer blares )

09:54.837 --> 09:57.420
( both panting )

10:06.961 --> 10:09.295
( Martha talking over phone,
indistinct )

10:16.378 --> 10:19.795
Oh, yeah,
I've talked to Rayna.
She's down.

10:21.378 --> 10:23.629
So you'll bet 500,000
on the fight,

10:23.629 --> 10:26.128
take 20% off the top,

10:26.128 --> 10:27.670
and we'll split
the rest.

10:30.211 --> 10:31.629
All right.

10:36.045 --> 10:37.337
Hold on a sec.

10:38.503 --> 10:39.754
The odds are even,

10:39.754 --> 10:42.211
so she needs to know
who to bet on.

10:49.545 --> 10:51.503
You know what?
We're gonna have to
call you back with that.

10:51.503 --> 10:53.128
Till then, just get
the money together

10:53.128 --> 10:55.961
and then we'll make the bet
first thing in the morning.

10:55.961 --> 10:57.170
Okay?

10:58.920 --> 11:00.670
All right,
I'll get back to you.

11:04.795 --> 11:09.670
Look, it doesn't really matter
who wins or loses, right?

11:09.670 --> 11:11.545
Right.

11:11.545 --> 11:15.253
Because we're gonna get out
after tomorrow night
anyways, right?

11:15.253 --> 11:16.920
Right.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.879
Okay, so then
it doesn't matter.

11:20.211 --> 11:22.545
Right,
it doesn't matter.

11:22.545 --> 11:24.045
Yeah, so?

11:26.420 --> 11:28.211
So?

11:32.086 --> 11:35.045
( sighs )

11:35.045 --> 11:37.503
( both panting )

11:43.253 --> 11:45.170
( grunts )

11:49.545 --> 11:51.795
Hey!
What the fuck, man?!

11:51.795 --> 11:53.587
- You're fucking cheating!
- I'm not fucking
cheating, dude!

11:53.587 --> 11:55.503
I fucking saw you
grab the bed, bitch.

11:55.503 --> 11:57.670
You're just fucking scared
'cause you know I was
gonna fucking win!

11:57.670 --> 11:59.920
No, 'cause you're
fucking cheating!

12:07.754 --> 12:09.754
Enough.

12:17.545 --> 12:19.837
Greta:
So, we gotta
watch the faces

12:19.837 --> 12:22.253
so that we don't look like shit
for tomorrow night.

12:23.754 --> 12:24.920
We gotta cover our asses

12:24.920 --> 12:26.920
so that no one
gets suspicious.

12:26.920 --> 12:30.629
No, shit.
We gotta keep this shit
super tight and be careful.

12:30.629 --> 12:33.920
And since there's no judge,
we gotta keep it clean.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.128
- No face work.
- Simple.

12:36.128 --> 12:38.253
All right,
how many rounds, three?

12:38.253 --> 12:40.337
Rayna:
Three two-minute rounds.

12:40.337 --> 12:42.211
Greta:
So, winner takes 60%?

12:42.211 --> 12:44.961
Rayna:
Hold up. On the phone,
you told Martha we split 50/50.

12:44.961 --> 12:47.961
Greta:
Yeah, but I think
the winner should get more.

12:47.961 --> 12:50.003
What, scared
you're gonna lose?

12:50.003 --> 12:53.170
Rayna:
Fuck you.
60/40 it is.

12:53.170 --> 12:55.170
- Greta: Tap out?
- Tap out.

12:55.170 --> 12:57.337
Whoever taps loses.

13:04.128 --> 13:06.503
( both panting )

13:12.629 --> 13:15.253
- ( both groan )
- Fuck.

13:19.754 --> 13:23.295
What do your kids think
when they see you like this?

13:23.295 --> 13:25.545
They're used to it.

13:27.211 --> 13:30.337
( sighs )
What are you gonna do
when you get out of this?

13:30.337 --> 13:32.670
( scoffs )

13:32.670 --> 13:35.170
That's a good question.

13:35.170 --> 13:37.170
What are you
gonna do?

13:43.712 --> 13:45.503
I don't know.

13:53.545 --> 13:56.211
Fighting's the only thing
I've ever been good at,

13:56.211 --> 13:58.712
but I'm tired of getting
fucked over, man.

14:01.045 --> 14:02.378
( sighs )

14:03.712 --> 14:05.879
Okay, let's finish
this thing.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.003
Last round.

14:27.879 --> 14:29.170
( exhales )

14:47.712 --> 14:49.587
( both grunting )

14:52.837 --> 14:54.629
- ( grunts )
- ( grunts, groans )

15:06.045 --> 15:08.086
- ( grunts )
- Fuck!

15:26.795 --> 15:29.086
( grunts )

15:42.295 --> 15:44.837
( buzzer blares )

15:44.837 --> 15:46.503
( both panting )

15:57.295 --> 16:00.879
- Greta: What if no one taps?
- ( exhales )

16:00.879 --> 16:04.837
Rayna:
One of us is gonna tap,
but it ain't gonna be me.

16:06.462 --> 16:07.337
( groans )

16:08.837 --> 16:11.754
Greta:
I've never tapped in my life.

16:11.754 --> 16:15.503
Rayna:
Well, one of us
has to lose.

16:36.295 --> 16:38.211
( both grunting )

16:59.086 --> 17:01.545
( groaning )

17:13.879 --> 17:16.670
( both screaming )

17:20.670 --> 17:24.045
( both grunting )

17:28.420 --> 17:33.211
- Fucking tap!
- Tap, bitch, before
I break your fucking arm.

17:36.086 --> 17:38.211
- Greta: Tap!
- ( grunts )

17:41.128 --> 17:42.795
Tap.

17:44.086 --> 17:46.712
Fucking tap!

17:46.712 --> 17:49.754
( both grunting )

18:13.670 --> 18:15.337
( sighs )

18:15.337 --> 18:17.128
( mutters )

18:25.629 --> 18:27.337
There's that.

18:34.503 --> 18:36.337
Jesus.

18:44.003 --> 18:46.795
( TV playing, muffled )

18:48.670 --> 18:51.670
( women grunting )

18:53.211 --> 18:55.961
- Man: Oh!
- ( crowd cheering )

18:58.837 --> 19:02.420
- Commentator:
Come on! Oh, man!
- Everything okay in there?

19:02.420 --> 19:04.879
Man:
Uh, yeah,
crazy good fight!

19:04.879 --> 19:07.045
Yeah?
Who's fighting?

19:07.045 --> 19:10.462
I don't know.
Two chicks, but they're
fucking going at it.

19:10.462 --> 19:12.003
It's an all-out brawl.

19:12.003 --> 19:14.670
