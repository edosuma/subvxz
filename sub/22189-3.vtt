WEBVTT

01:40.600 --> 01:43.560
THE DAY BEFORE

01:45.480 --> 01:48.320
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

01:55.160 --> 01:56.800
Mrs. Monaschi...

01:57.760 --> 01:59.440
Why did you call me?

02:02.120 --> 02:04.840
A priest
from the Commission was kidnapped.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.200
He's being blackmailed.

02:06.280 --> 02:07.760
Can you find him?

02:12.240 --> 02:13.360
What if I can?

02:15.640 --> 02:16.960
The Ostia land...

02:18.520 --> 02:20.120
50/50.

03:24.560 --> 03:28.320
-You're just gonna go like that?
-I didn't wanna wake you.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.400
Not enough?

03:39.840 --> 03:41.160
Enough for what?

03:41.440 --> 03:43.920
For last night and to make you forget
what you saw.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.120
I don't sleep with clients,

03:50.200 --> 03:52.360
and I don't talk about things
I don't know.

03:57.560 --> 03:59.120
You can keep the cash.

04:03.240 --> 04:05.160
Fine, buy yourself a nice dress,

04:06.520 --> 04:08.360
I want to see you in it next time.

04:34.760 --> 04:36.040
Come on, it's late.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.400
Look, the monsignor's
not going anywhere.

04:43.480 --> 04:44.760
What are you looking at?

04:45.800 --> 04:46.720
Nothing.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.040
I'm glad you didn't kill her.

04:52.080 --> 04:54.240
Would have been a waste, Gabriele.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.480
Bye, Nazareno.

05:00.560 --> 05:01.600
See ya.

05:19.880 --> 05:22.040
If you're looking for my brother,
he's at home.

05:22.120 --> 05:24.120
I'm not looking for Manfredi. I need you.

05:24.840 --> 05:26.240
You're Spadino, right?

05:28.760 --> 05:30.600
How's business?

05:32.120 --> 05:33.600
It's good, why?

05:34.360 --> 05:36.280
What business have you got, Spadino?

05:38.720 --> 05:40.000
Family stuff.

05:40.640 --> 05:44.600
That is, loan-sharking, dealing...
the usual gypsy bullshit?

05:45.080 --> 05:47.080
So why have you come to bust my balls?

05:50.480 --> 05:52.560
-What are you talking about?
-You're blackmailing a priest.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.160
You even made him disappear.

05:54.880 --> 05:57.360
The fuck you doing,
business outside the family?

05:59.800 --> 06:01.080
And even if?

06:02.040 --> 06:04.680
-Not your problem.
-But it is.

06:04.760 --> 06:07.040
Or else I wouldn't even
talk to someone like you.

06:07.320 --> 06:08.480
Where's the priest?

06:14.400 --> 06:16.760
Let's try and make a deal.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.360
I was gonna make a lot of cash
with the priest.

06:21.240 --> 06:22.800
Free the priest.

06:24.360 --> 06:25.800
Now.

06:42.120 --> 06:43.320
Still not ready?

06:46.000 --> 06:48.240
You'll be late for the meeting.

06:48.320 --> 06:49.360
Yeah, I'm going now.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.320
Bye. Are you tired?

06:53.080 --> 06:54.120
Bye, sweetheart.

06:55.480 --> 06:57.640
-Let's go. Bye.
-Bye.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.000
Get out.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.960
What the fuck, are you deaf?
I said get out!

08:11.680 --> 08:13.680
Douchebag.

08:59.160 --> 09:00.080
How's the priest?

09:05.000 --> 09:06.040
Well?

09:09.800 --> 09:10.920
I had to free him.

09:12.520 --> 09:16.160
-What did you say?
-Samurai came to me this morning.

09:18.360 --> 09:19.320
Get out of my way.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.880
Samurai, really? What did he say?

09:22.960 --> 09:25.520
He knew we had the priest,
that we're blackmailing him.

09:25.800 --> 09:28.720
-Did he know about all three of us?
-No, he knows fuck all about you two.

09:32.720 --> 09:34.800
Do you realize what the fuck you've done?

09:34.880 --> 09:37.720
-What the fuck was I supposed to do?
-Not shit your pants.

09:37.960 --> 09:39.560
You should have talked to me first.

09:42.960 --> 09:46.160
You bowed down to that piece of shit.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.080
It's my fault,

09:49.520 --> 09:52.080
doing business with this one, a cop's son,

09:52.360 --> 09:54.880
and with you, a gypsy scumbag,

09:54.960 --> 09:57.600
like your brother,
but at least he's a man.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.960
-Fuck you!
-Piece of shit.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.200
What the fuck you gonna do?

10:05.480 --> 10:06.760
You wanna kill me?

10:08.440 --> 10:09.600
Go on, kill me.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.160
I don't want to see you anymore.

10:51.520 --> 10:52.560
Yes?

10:52.640 --> 10:55.760
I want to change the agenda
for today's meeting.

10:55.840 --> 10:56.800
Here.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.760
Have the councilmen been informed?

11:01.840 --> 11:04.280
No, but I'm the chairman,
it's my prerogative.

11:06.360 --> 11:09.360
Make copies and distribute them,
thank you.

11:09.440 --> 11:10.320
All right.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.320
What are you still doing here?

11:49.520 --> 11:50.520
Listen, Spadino,

11:52.920 --> 11:54.440
have you got 30,000 euros?

11:55.560 --> 11:57.560
And fuck you, too.

12:18.120 --> 12:20.520
Now it's all over, you can relax.

12:21.160 --> 12:24.400
Sure, you didn't spend
the night in some hole

12:24.520 --> 12:26.920
after being manhandled
by those animals.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.080
It's your fault.

12:28.880 --> 12:31.600
I didn't think
certain things could happen.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.960
I'm sorry about what happened.

12:37.600 --> 12:41.000
You're right. It's awful. I understand.

12:45.080 --> 12:48.360
But now you need to convene the Commission
as soon as possible.

12:49.560 --> 12:52.280
Fine, but I don't want to hear any more
about this business.

12:52.520 --> 12:55.920
Of course, I know,
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't necessary,

12:56.760 --> 12:58.320
but it's the final step.

13:06.600 --> 13:07.760
Ah, there you are.

13:08.520 --> 13:11.920
You changed the agenda?
You want to discuss the Ostia deal?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.400
-Yes.
-Yesterday we couldn't change anything.

13:14.480 --> 13:16.840
Well, today we can. Urgent reasons.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.720
Urgent for your own interests!

13:19.640 --> 13:21.360
Who are you doing the favor for?

13:21.440 --> 13:22.760
Serri, watch it.

13:30.400 --> 13:31.880
How is the monsignor?

13:33.480 --> 13:34.440
Good.

13:35.720 --> 13:37.240
Is he ready to sign?

13:38.160 --> 13:40.280
Yes, but first we need to talk.

13:42.040 --> 13:43.480
About what?

13:45.120 --> 13:47.200
About my husband's company's share,

13:47.840 --> 13:50.520
we said 50/50, didn't we?

13:51.760 --> 13:55.760
You said that,
but I solved the monsignor problem,

13:55.840 --> 13:57.240
now I get everything.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.200
What, everything?

14:00.920 --> 14:03.400
The Vatican land goes to me,

14:03.640 --> 14:06.040
or else the monsignor's troubles
are not over.

14:06.440 --> 14:08.680
It would only take me a second to leak it.

14:09.880 --> 14:11.960
The priests have to sell to my company.

14:18.280 --> 14:20.240
But we had a deal!

14:20.320 --> 14:22.920
Do you know how long
I've been working on this deal?

14:25.040 --> 14:27.520
No, and frankly, I don't care.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.960
You shouldn't have come here,
look at the state of your shoes.

15:00.520 --> 15:02.360
-Hi, Moreno.
-Hi.

15:02.720 --> 15:03.720
Here he is.

15:06.480 --> 15:09.760
-What are all these people doing here?
-Why, you don't know about it?

15:11.120 --> 15:12.040
No.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.720
Manfredi's cousin's been killed.

15:20.480 --> 15:21.480
Who gives a shit?

15:22.160 --> 15:23.760
You wanna be an asshole about it?

15:23.840 --> 15:27.120
You beat him up, I asked you to bring him
the cash and you know nothing?

15:27.200 --> 15:30.280
-Now tell them that...
-I said it wasn't me!

15:32.080 --> 15:34.760
And now we're shitting ourselves
because of gypsies?

15:36.520 --> 15:38.400
He really still doesn't fucking get it.

15:40.600 --> 15:41.760
But you guys do...

16:14.240 --> 16:15.200
Hi.

16:17.760 --> 16:18.800
Hi.

16:22.160 --> 16:23.880
I heard about your cousin.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.080
How did it happen?

16:34.880 --> 16:36.560
They crushed his face,

16:37.880 --> 16:41.360
broke his cheekbones,
his jaw and his nose.

16:43.240 --> 16:44.760
They slaughtered him.

16:51.280 --> 16:52.680
What happens now?

16:52.760 --> 16:56.120
What the fuck do you think's
gonna happen, Angelica? War.

16:58.520 --> 17:00.360
Promise me you'll be careful.

17:01.040 --> 17:01.960
What do you want?

17:02.040 --> 17:04.200
You said you didn't want
to see me anymore.

17:05.920 --> 17:09.319
-I just wanted to see how you were.
-You've seen me, I'm fine, okay?

17:11.480 --> 17:12.920
Forget it.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.880
To me, you gotta tell the truth.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.800
-Whose dog is this?
-It's mine now.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.040
What the fuck have you done, Aureliano?

17:54.400 --> 17:56.840
He was just a piece of gypsy scum, Livia.

17:57.760 --> 18:00.240
-Why didn't you tell me?
-What was I supposed to say?

18:00.320 --> 18:01.920
That you're an asshole.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.200
And you complain about Dad...

18:05.160 --> 18:07.480
Now you listen to me
and do exactly what I say.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.400
-First, this dog's gotta disappear.
-He'll die without me.

18:11.480 --> 18:15.760
You don't seem to get it.
I'll say it for the last time.

18:15.840 --> 18:18.400
I'll cover you with Dad,
but get rid of the dog.

18:18.760 --> 18:22.280
And then keep your head down
till we figure out if anyone saw you.

18:24.160 --> 18:25.200
Got it?

18:28.760 --> 18:30.720
-Got it?
-Got it.

18:33.920 --> 18:36.840
What's up? What's this here?

18:38.480 --> 18:40.720
[in Sinti]
[Aureliano Adami is an animal.]

18:40.800 --> 18:43.080
[He kicked him to death like a dog.]

18:44.600 --> 18:48.120
[We gotta shoot him in the face,
so even his father can't recognize him.]

18:49.520 --> 18:51.000
[We'll find him and tie him up,]

18:52.040 --> 18:54.240
[drag him to his house
and leave him there.]

19:12.040 --> 19:13.560
Don't look at me like that.

19:22.800 --> 19:23.880
I'm sorry.

20:19.680 --> 20:23.240
You served up the monsignor
on a silver platter, what did you expect?

20:23.760 --> 20:24.920
To go halves?

20:25.960 --> 20:28.200
You need to learn who you're dealing with.

20:30.080 --> 20:33.800
At any rate, you made a mistake,
but you can still fix it.

20:33.880 --> 20:36.360
-How?
-Play for time.

20:37.360 --> 20:40.840
Get Theodosiou away from Rome
and from Samurai

20:40.920 --> 20:43.320
and slow down the Commission decisions.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.760
-Countess, this one?
-No, my dear.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.080
It doesn't go here.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.840
I even know whose this is.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.480
Do you know Mr. Finucci?

20:57.080 --> 20:59.800
The Building Commission's
technical counselor?

20:59.880 --> 21:03.120
It's his job to make sure
that the companies that buy land

21:03.200 --> 21:06.000
in the new zoning plan are clean.

21:06.600 --> 21:09.960
Without his approval, no sale
will be approved by the Commission.

21:10.240 --> 21:13.000
Samurai's company
needs to be vetted by Finucci,

21:13.080 --> 21:15.000
so he put him on his payroll.

21:15.640 --> 21:18.480
But not for long.
I've got a little surprise for him.

21:19.680 --> 21:22.960
Mr. Finucci is about to be indicted.

21:23.640 --> 21:26.600
His life is about to get very complicated.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.440
Come, I'll show you around.

21:29.520 --> 21:32.640
You don't know how many
needy people I help with this center.

21:34.240 --> 21:37.680
So, are we all here?
We can begin, do you agree?

21:43.120 --> 21:46.880
As you know, in Ostia there is a project
to merge two lots of land

21:46.960 --> 21:48.800
with a view to building a port...

21:48.880 --> 21:50.640
I'm sorry to interrupt.

21:50.920 --> 21:52.640
Mr. Finucci, the mayor wants you.

21:54.160 --> 21:55.280
Urgently!

22:10.160 --> 22:13.480
"Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee,

22:13.560 --> 22:17.680
blessed art thou amongst women,
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.480
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

22:20.560 --> 22:22.680
pray for us sinners,

22:22.760 --> 22:26.600
now and at the hour of our death. Amen..."

22:41.000 --> 22:42.240
What do you want?

22:42.880 --> 22:45.120
You've got to leave Rome, right away.

22:46.520 --> 22:48.520
You told me to call a meeting.

22:49.200 --> 22:52.080
I know, but the kidnappers
might change their minds.

22:52.760 --> 22:54.920
It's best to disappear for a while.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.480
Why don't you leave me in peace?

22:56.800 --> 23:00.280
Maybe you don't realize
the mess you've made.

23:01.880 --> 23:04.920
I don't want to see
those people ever again.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.840
Exactly, so listen to me.

23:09.280 --> 23:12.760
It's best if you get out of Rome,
let them forget you,

23:14.080 --> 23:17.000
until it all dies down.

23:58.400 --> 24:00.440
What do you want now?

24:04.520 --> 24:06.720
They're mourning a dead man at my house.

24:10.640 --> 24:12.040
Did you kill him?

24:25.600 --> 24:27.080
Don't ask me, Spadino.

24:30.880 --> 24:32.480
But I'm asking.

24:40.720 --> 24:42.640
Don't you want to tell me, Aureliano?

24:47.520 --> 24:51.200
It's got fuck all to do with you and me.
Don't let our families come between us.

25:09.440 --> 25:10.560
See ya, Spadino.

25:48.480 --> 25:51.400
If squatting is a misdemeanor,
property speculation is a crime.

25:51.480 --> 25:53.760
That's the only way
that families like ours

25:53.840 --> 25:55.600
have gotten a roof over our heads.

25:55.680 --> 25:59.840
We've been fighting for 11 months
for the right to public housing.

25:59.920 --> 26:02.040
-Thanks for dropping by.
-Not at all.

26:02.120 --> 26:05.600
They wanted to get us out by force,
but we're not leaving these houses.

26:05.680 --> 26:08.320
We've already seen
what was supposed to scare us.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.120
It's time everyone understood
this building is our right,

26:11.200 --> 26:13.800
and it's the duty of the State
to give it to us.

26:14.720 --> 26:17.040
The government must listen to us!

26:18.560 --> 26:20.800
Thank God, we're not alone anymore,

26:20.880 --> 26:23.360
we've got representatives in City Hall,

26:23.600 --> 26:25.440
people like Amedeo Cinaglia,

26:25.520 --> 26:28.040
people who believe in the struggle,
honest politicians,

26:28.120 --> 26:30.240
who've got the balls to fight for us.

26:30.320 --> 26:31.720
Nothing can stop us now.

26:51.680 --> 26:52.880
Sara?

27:05.320 --> 27:08.240
-Are you insane? My husband's home.
-I'm in the shit.

27:13.240 --> 27:14.320
What happened?

27:14.920 --> 27:17.640
I owe a guy money, a lot of money.

27:18.000 --> 27:18.920
How much?

27:19.640 --> 27:21.240
Thirty thousand.

27:21.320 --> 27:22.760
Thirty thousand?

27:22.840 --> 27:23.960
By today.

27:24.960 --> 27:27.440
But I haven't got it! And by today...

27:27.520 --> 27:29.560
Why didn't you tell me before?

27:32.320 --> 27:34.080
Sara, please, I need it now.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.160
Help me.

27:37.760 --> 27:40.280
I have no idea how
to find that much money.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.680
Or you've got no idea how
to find it for me.

27:44.760 --> 27:45.920
Please...

27:49.720 --> 27:51.200
I see... Never mind.

27:51.440 --> 27:53.840
Forget I ever asked you for the money.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.240
What's the big hurry to see me?

28:10.800 --> 28:13.000
With the shit day I've had...

28:13.080 --> 28:15.240
And it looks like it's just the beginning.

28:29.520 --> 28:32.240
Let's talk in here,
they delivered it today,

28:32.960 --> 28:35.560
maybe the cops haven't had time
to bug it yet.

28:37.680 --> 28:40.360
Because we don't like
people talking about us.

28:41.840 --> 28:44.920
Look, I'm not going to say anything,
I've never been a rat.

28:45.200 --> 28:48.440
But you're under pressure
and people change under pressure.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.520
Don't be stupid, Giacomo.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.240
I won't send you an indictment.

29:07.960 --> 29:09.040
Here, pumpkin.

29:10.760 --> 29:12.000
It's ready, come on.

29:13.240 --> 29:14.320
You coming?

29:16.000 --> 29:17.360
Yes, be right there.

29:23.400 --> 29:25.520
What's wrong? You seem strange.

29:28.640 --> 29:31.360
I think Finucci
is going to be put under house arrest.

29:31.840 --> 29:33.160
The guy who works with you?

29:33.240 --> 29:35.360
Yeah, he's under investigation.

29:36.840 --> 29:38.640
-Are you mixed up in it too?
-No.

29:39.880 --> 29:42.080
-No.
-Then, there's no problem.

29:42.360 --> 29:43.960
No, that's right, no problem.

29:45.320 --> 29:47.120
Let's go eat. It's getting cold.

29:57.040 --> 29:58.200
You start.

30:16.400 --> 30:19.640
Piece of shit!
This time I'll kill you, get out!

30:20.200 --> 30:22.760
Scumbag, get out!

30:50.760 --> 30:52.080
It's me. It's Gabriele.

30:52.760 --> 30:54.800
I need help. I'm in deep shit.

31:34.280 --> 31:37.560
[I want that bastard
Aureliano Adami dead tonight.]

31:37.640 --> 31:39.240
[Go get him in his hangout.]

31:49.440 --> 31:50.440
[Let's go!]

32:03.960 --> 32:05.120
I'm going too.

32:10.800 --> 32:13.960
Let's go. What is it? What's here?

32:14.040 --> 32:19.320
Come on, show me! Come up!

32:19.400 --> 32:21.800
Shit for brains, took the dog too...

32:23.560 --> 32:27.840
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
You don't bullshit me!

32:28.440 --> 32:31.080
Now you're gonna explain
why you killed him!

32:31.160 --> 32:34.200
-What's wrong with your head?
-Don't touch me.

32:35.080 --> 32:38.240
Can't mind your own fucking business?
Couldn't keep your mouth shut?

32:38.320 --> 32:41.720
She's the only one who thinks straight,
not like you, dickhead.

32:41.800 --> 32:43.560
I said don't touch me.

32:46.040 --> 32:48.120
If they don't kill you, I will.

33:10.960 --> 33:12.440
What the fuck have you done?

33:17.680 --> 33:19.480
It's better like this, Aureliano.

33:20.200 --> 33:21.600
The dog was just a problem.

33:28.560 --> 33:31.800
He's your son, try to remember that.

33:33.080 --> 33:34.320
Dickhead.

34:12.320 --> 34:14.880
I'm worried about what's happening
to Finucci.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.120
It's just another problem to solve.

34:21.239 --> 34:23.400
We'll have to bribe
whoever takes his place

34:23.480 --> 34:25.080
and you gotta be the one to do it.

34:25.400 --> 34:28.440
No, maybe you don't get it, I want out.

34:29.120 --> 34:31.320
I don't want anything like this
to happen to me.

34:31.400 --> 34:32.800
I don't want to be compromised.

34:34.560 --> 34:37.560
You've already done something for me.
You're already compromised.

34:38.600 --> 34:41.360
Are you afraid of the mayor, the press?

34:41.440 --> 34:43.040
Then you don't get it,

34:43.679 --> 34:46.000
it's not them you should be afraid of.

34:50.280 --> 34:53.679
The mayor's going in two weeks
and the game will be over.

34:53.760 --> 34:57.040
I need someone in Finucci's place now.

37:16.680 --> 37:17.960
[Go that way.]

37:37.720 --> 37:38.680
You stay here.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.960
You go down there, run!

37:54.600 --> 37:55.920
Follow Tiziano!

38:41.920 --> 38:42.840
Go.

39:00.280 --> 39:01.360
I said go.

39:02.200 --> 39:03.360
Go, for fuck's sake.

39:04.400 --> 39:05.360
Go.

39:15.560 --> 39:17.040
What the fuck's going on?

39:22.720 --> 39:25.400
[Have you seen him?
He came this way!]

39:26.360 --> 39:27.480
He's not here.

39:31.960 --> 39:33.240
We lost him.

39:42.720 --> 39:44.520
