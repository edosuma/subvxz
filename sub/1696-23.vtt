WEBVTT

00:01.270 --> 00:03.602
Mmm. Nothing better
on a peanut butter sandwich

00:03.672 --> 00:08.268
than pickle chips,
a little bit of mustard and chili.

00:10.445 --> 00:11.605
What?

00:12.681 --> 00:15.809
It all ends up in the same place.

00:15.884 --> 00:19.081
Here she comes! Here she comes!
It's The Cracker!

00:24.226 --> 00:26.660
That's the new girl.
Why do they call her The Cracker?

00:26.728 --> 00:28.161
Watch.

00:31.333 --> 00:34.029
Even from here it hurts.

00:34.102 --> 00:36.332
Rumor is, when her old school
kicked her out,

00:36.405 --> 00:37.895
they had to call animal control.

00:37.973 --> 00:41.773
It took six dogcatchers
and a giant net to bring her down.

00:41.844 --> 00:43.243
Come on, Lilly,

00:43.312 --> 00:45.007
it's hard enough
to be the new kid in school

00:45.080 --> 00:47.207
without people
making up stories about you.

00:47.282 --> 00:49.079
Remember when I moved here
from Tennessee

00:49.151 --> 00:52.211
and somebody spread a rumor
that I ate possum?

00:53.856 --> 00:55.949
I didn't know you then.

00:56.024 --> 00:58.117
I bet she's a nice kid.

01:00.395 --> 01:03.296
With freakishly strong hands.

01:03.365 --> 01:06.232
Come on, guys,
I say we all go and say hi.

01:06.301 --> 01:08.326
What do you know,
she might surprise us.

01:08.403 --> 01:10.030
And even if she is a bully,

01:10.105 --> 01:14.064
it's not like she is going
to pull anything with Mrs. Rush here.

01:15.310 --> 01:17.904
Yeah, eyes like a hawk.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.946
Tell you what,
you go make friends with The Cracker

01:23.018 --> 01:26.044
and I'll stay here
and start writing your will.

01:26.121 --> 01:28.385
Put me down for all her shoes.

01:29.324 --> 01:31.019
I mean, good luck.

01:32.294 --> 01:34.421
The fellowship of the wienies.

01:36.265 --> 01:37.994
Hi. I'm Miley.

01:40.569 --> 01:43.504
You know, I used to be new here, too.

01:43.572 --> 01:45.130
But now I'm old here.

01:45.207 --> 01:48.370
Well, not old-old, like this meatloaf.

01:51.980 --> 01:53.504
Neat trick.

01:53.582 --> 01:56.244
You know, I saw <i>The Nutcracker</i> once.

01:57.386 --> 01:58.785
Loved it.

01:59.755 --> 02:03.191
- Got any lipstick?
- Sure. Yeah.

02:04.393 --> 02:06.384
This color will look great on you.

02:06.461 --> 02:08.860
I can tell we're gonna be good friends.

02:13.902 --> 02:15.699
Call animal control.

02:22.611 --> 02:24.704
She's behind me, isn't she?

02:29.685 --> 02:31.380
Anybody got a net?

02:37.659 --> 02:39.251
<i> Come on!</i>

02:39.328 --> 02:43.321
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

02:43.398 --> 02:46.993
<i>Hottest styles, every shoe, every color</i>

02:47.069 --> 02:50.766
<i>Yeah, when you're famous</i>
<i>it can be kind of fun</i>

02:50.839 --> 02:55.708
<i>It's really you</i>
<i>but no one ever discovers</i>

02:55.777 --> 02:58.837
<i>Who would have thought</i>
<i>that a girl like me</i>

02:58.914 --> 03:04.409
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

03:04.486 --> 03:08.513
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

03:08.590 --> 03:10.455
<i>Chill it out, take it slow</i>

03:10.525 --> 03:12.152
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

03:12.227 --> 03:16.664
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

03:16.732 --> 03:18.199
<i>Mix it all together</i>

03:18.266 --> 03:21.531
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

03:26.508 --> 03:30.808
Now, Robbie Ray, you and Jackson
enjoy that father-son fishing trip.

03:32.047 --> 03:36.450
I won't let anything harm a hair
on your baby girl's pretty little head.

03:37.686 --> 03:39.085
Gotta go.

03:40.622 --> 03:43.216
- Who did this to you?
- The new kid in school.

03:43.291 --> 03:45.759
She thinks I look better with my hair up.

03:47.062 --> 03:49.622
Didn't anybody try to help you?

03:49.698 --> 03:51.359
That would be me.

03:53.068 --> 03:54.433
I can't believe this.

03:54.503 --> 03:59.304
All I was doing was trying to be nice
and now I'm a big old target.

03:59.374 --> 04:01.399
Yeah, and thanks to you, so am I.

04:01.476 --> 04:06.413
If I'd only believed that possum story,
my life would be a lot simpler.

04:06.481 --> 04:08.381
First thing tomorrow,
you go right to that principal

04:08.450 --> 04:10.008
and you tell him what's going on.

04:10.085 --> 04:12.417
And be a snitch? No way!

04:12.487 --> 04:14.648
Well, then it looks like
I'm gonna have to go down there

04:14.723 --> 04:17.487
and protect you myself
from The Cookie.

04:17.559 --> 04:21.495
She's not The Cookie,
she's The Cracker.

04:22.898 --> 04:25.833
I don't care
what kind of snack food she is,

04:25.901 --> 04:27.300
she's gonna have to get through me.

04:27.369 --> 04:30.964
But, Roxy, at school I'm Miley,
not Hannah.

04:31.039 --> 04:33.269
I can't use my bodyguard
to fight my battles.

04:33.341 --> 04:35.468
Can't you just teach me
some of your special moves?

04:35.544 --> 04:37.876
Oh, you mean like this?

04:43.018 --> 04:45.213
What's so special about that?

04:47.556 --> 04:51.583
That's right. Roxy's like a puma.
And this kitty's got claws.

04:53.728 --> 04:55.889
- Can you teach me that?
- No way.

04:55.964 --> 04:59.559
- You only use violence as a last resort.
- And when is that?

04:59.634 --> 05:03.161
When she yanks out my intestines
and wears it as a belt?

05:03.238 --> 05:06.469
Okay, okay, I got a move
that'll work for you.

05:06.541 --> 05:11.035
Lilly, you be the bully and I'll be Miley.
Now, get all up in my grill.

05:15.117 --> 05:16.709
I'd rather not.

05:18.520 --> 05:20.852
Come on, I'm not gonna hurt you.

05:20.922 --> 05:24.790
Now, here I am, walking in the halls
with blue eyes, all perky.

05:24.860 --> 05:27.954
Come on, girl, show me what you got.

05:28.029 --> 05:30.327
Hey, Miley, give me your lipstick.

05:31.533 --> 05:34.331
Principal! Principal! Help me! Help me!

05:36.938 --> 05:39.372
That's how you handle a bully.

05:39.441 --> 05:41.966
- You want me to run away?
- Like a free range chicken.

05:49.251 --> 05:51.481
I can't believe Roxy
wouldn't show you some moves.

05:51.553 --> 05:53.077
Just the way
she puma'd that pineapple

05:53.155 --> 05:55.316
would've scared the juice out of me.

05:55.390 --> 05:58.484
That's just it.
Lilly, I don't have to be a puma.

05:58.560 --> 06:01.859
I just have to make
The Cracker think I'm one.

06:01.930 --> 06:03.329
Lilly likey.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:12.073 --> 06:13.199
Ow!

06:16.978 --> 06:19.105
Well, I'm sorry about your fishing trip.

06:19.181 --> 06:23.277
But that is why they call them
freak storms 'cause they're freaky.

06:23.351 --> 06:25.512
Could you open the door?

06:25.587 --> 06:29.023
You know, you boys are lucky
I'm still open.

06:29.090 --> 06:33.390
The Health department
wanted to close me down last week.

06:33.461 --> 06:37.693
- Really? Why was that?
- Oh, bugs. Big, big bugs.

06:39.067 --> 06:42.503
But don't worry,
we're fumigating all the other rooms.

06:42.571 --> 06:45.005
'Cause you already did this one?

06:46.775 --> 06:48.140
Okay.

06:52.047 --> 06:54.515
Welcome to the honeymoon suite.

06:56.117 --> 06:58.142
- Wow.
- Yeah.

06:58.220 --> 07:00.415
You know, it's kind of funny,
when I pictured my honeymoon,

07:00.488 --> 07:02.786
it didn't include
the big heart-shaped bed

07:02.857 --> 07:06.884
or the red satin wallpaper or my dad!

07:08.730 --> 07:11.563
Well, it's better than having
your mother-in-law along.

07:11.633 --> 07:15.069
Boy! That was a nightmare.

07:15.136 --> 07:17.434
Well, I'll tell you what, I'll get Franklin

07:17.505 --> 07:20.906
to bring you boys
some fresh towelettes.

07:20.976 --> 07:23.706
- You mean towels.
- Okay.

07:27.249 --> 07:30.650
- I wanna go home.
- Oh, come on, Jackson.

07:30.719 --> 07:34.120
The whole point of this trip was
to have a little father-son bonding time.

07:34.189 --> 07:36.316
So we've hit a bump in the road.

07:36.391 --> 07:39.326
Why don't we just look at it
as an adventure?

07:42.797 --> 07:46.062
Okay, I really wanna go home.

07:46.134 --> 07:47.624
Oh, it's not that bad.

07:47.702 --> 07:52.036
Matter of fact, it kind of reminds me
of poker night in Uncle Earl's RV.

07:53.174 --> 07:55.972
It's Franklin with your towelettes!

07:59.314 --> 08:03.751
Remember, it's still an adventure,
it's just an adventure with a puppet.

08:03.818 --> 08:07.254
You two in the honeymoon suite?
Awkward!

08:09.291 --> 08:13.557
Franklin, how many times
have I told you not to tease the guests?

08:13.628 --> 08:16.358
That is no way to get repeat business.

08:17.532 --> 08:19.124
Enjoy your stay.

08:22.704 --> 08:25.104
We are sleeping in shifts.

08:48.063 --> 08:50.190
That's right. Miley like a puma.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.865
Yeah, she a bad puma!
You better run, Cracker!

08:55.937 --> 08:57.905
Go ahead, start running!

08:59.374 --> 09:00.932
Why isn't she running?

09:05.480 --> 09:08.347
I'm warning you, Miley like a puma.

09:09.951 --> 09:12.419
Miley like a puma.

09:14.889 --> 09:16.880
Miley run like a puma.

09:22.464 --> 09:23.795
Dad, stop.

09:26.801 --> 09:28.894
Dad, stop tickling my feet.

09:29.871 --> 09:32.931
What are you talking about, Son?
I'm over here.

09:34.976 --> 09:36.637
Bugs! Bugs! Bugs!

09:38.146 --> 09:40.444
We are so getting out of here.

09:40.515 --> 09:44.849
Not without your deluxe
complimentary breakfast.

09:44.919 --> 09:48.616
Thank you, but we're not
gonna be needing any of that

09:48.690 --> 09:50.214
yummy looking breakfast.

09:50.291 --> 09:51.417
We're gonna go ahead and see

09:51.493 --> 09:53.620
if we can't salvage
what's left of this fishing trip.

09:53.695 --> 09:55.686
Oh, I don't think
that's gonna happen today.

09:55.764 --> 09:58.699
The roads are still snowed in.
Looks to me like you're stuck.

10:08.710 --> 10:11.440
What do you know about that?
Looks like we're all stuck.

10:14.048 --> 10:16.016
He's right. We are stuck.

10:16.117 --> 10:19.052
Well, on the bright side,
at least he doesn't have the dummy.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.520
Who you calling a dummy, dummy?

10:22.724 --> 10:25.192
Dad, I've seen this movie before,

10:25.260 --> 10:28.093
and you and I
don't make it to the sequel.

10:42.977 --> 10:47.846
- Talk about a hairy situation.
- Don't make me laugh.

10:47.916 --> 10:50.441
Run for your lives! She's coming!

10:50.518 --> 10:53.180
Danny, calm down,
you're flaking up the hall.

10:53.254 --> 10:54.915
Yeah, she's in the cafeteria.

10:54.989 --> 10:56.889
Not The Cracker.
There's a new girl in school.

10:56.958 --> 10:58.448
She's even scarier!

10:58.526 --> 11:01.689
Where is she?
Where's The Cracker?

11:01.763 --> 11:04.254
Wait a minute, that sounds like...

11:05.099 --> 11:07.067
Oh, no.

11:07.135 --> 11:09.865
What up, girls?
Where do I park my board?

11:14.542 --> 11:16.476
Roxy, what are you doing here?

11:16.544 --> 11:20.878
- And why are you dressed like a kid?
- Quiet, I'm trying to blend in.

11:20.949 --> 11:23.941
What're you all looking at?
I got held back a grade or two.

11:24.018 --> 11:27.283
Who's counting? Not me.
That's why I got held back.

11:28.423 --> 11:30.448
Roxy, we need to talk in private.

11:30.525 --> 11:31.753
- Follow me.
- Follow me.

11:33.294 --> 11:35.091
- Let's just back up.
- Okay.

11:35.163 --> 11:37.324
Just go about your business.

11:37.398 --> 11:40.526
Nothing to see here
you can't see at the circus.

11:46.741 --> 11:49.232
Roxy, you can't be here.

11:49.310 --> 11:50.709
You said you weren't going
to the principal,

11:50.778 --> 11:52.746
and you're not wearing
your running shoes.

11:52.814 --> 11:55.647
Well, if you won't protect yourself,
Roxy will.

11:55.717 --> 11:57.116
Now stand still.

11:57.185 --> 12:00.120
It's time to pick this problem apart.
Turn around.

12:06.628 --> 12:10.724
- Wow, your hair looks great.
- You, too, I love the braid.

12:10.798 --> 12:14.859
That's my signature.
Float like a butterfly, braid with a bead.

12:14.936 --> 12:18.201
Now, come on, this puma's hungry
for some Cracker.

12:22.544 --> 12:24.637
You're sitting in my seat.

12:27.916 --> 12:29.941
- I don't think so.
- Cute.

12:31.686 --> 12:33.278
Can you do this?

12:41.129 --> 12:42.756
I'm not scared of you.

12:52.206 --> 12:54.504
Yeah, that's right.
Your bullying days are over.

12:54.576 --> 12:56.203
Because she's the big cheese

12:56.277 --> 12:58.905
and the cheese
always covers the cracker.

13:00.982 --> 13:04.281
- What did you do?
- I used ESP.

13:04.352 --> 13:06.115
Extra Sensory Puma.

13:12.193 --> 13:14.423
We're never gonna get out.

13:14.495 --> 13:17.862
- We're gonna die in here.
- No one is gonna die.

13:17.932 --> 13:21.129
Now stop focusing on the negative
and focus on the positive.

13:21.202 --> 13:24.194
Snowplow's gonna be here soon.

13:24.272 --> 13:27.264
Bad news, fellas.
Plow won't be here till morning.

13:27.342 --> 13:29.537
Sweet frozen niblets.

13:30.745 --> 13:34.977
I wanna live! I wanna live! I want to live!

13:38.920 --> 13:40.854
We gotta at least try to dig out again.
Right?

13:40.922 --> 13:44.949
With what? You broke
all of our best plastic spoons.

13:45.026 --> 13:48.518
Oh, please, he stole all that stuff
from Madam Fu's.

13:48.596 --> 13:53.398
- Madam who's?
- Madam Fu's.

13:53.468 --> 13:55.595
- Madam who's...
- Okay, forget it!

13:55.670 --> 13:58.537
Who needs spoons? I'm gonna ram it.

14:00.642 --> 14:03.372
Well, see you on the other side,
old man.

14:08.850 --> 14:11.785
I can't feel my lips.

14:22.697 --> 14:24.062
Don't even think about it.

14:24.132 --> 14:27.033
In fact, don't even think about
thinking about it.

14:27.101 --> 14:30.093
Yeah, you heard her. Flake off!

14:31.706 --> 14:34.470
Oh, yeah. Life at school
just got a whole lot better.

14:34.542 --> 14:36.373
Tell me about it.

14:36.444 --> 14:39.743
Look who's coming this way.
It's Troy McCann. He's so cute.

14:39.814 --> 14:42.476
- Hey, Lilly. Hey, Miley.
- Hi, Troy.

14:42.550 --> 14:45.075
Listen, the basketball team
is having a party this Saturday,

14:45.153 --> 14:47.053
and I was wondering
if you guys wanna go.

14:47.121 --> 14:48.349
- No, we can't.
- Actually, I...

14:48.423 --> 14:50.755
I said no! Now, move, move, move!

14:51.793 --> 14:56.423
He seems like a sweet boy.
Those the ones you gotta watch.

14:56.497 --> 14:59.796
Roxy, what are you doing?
I had my eyes on him.

15:01.936 --> 15:04.632
Never realized how many dangers
lurk in these halls.

15:04.706 --> 15:07.732
Bullies, boys, and that chicken potpie
they served today?

15:07.809 --> 15:09.401
That was nasty.

15:10.745 --> 15:13.737
From now on, we are brown bagging it.

15:13.815 --> 15:16.010
You're not thinking of staying,
are you, Roxy?

15:16.084 --> 15:19.281
I have to. If I leave, The Cracker's
gonna go back to cracking.

15:19.353 --> 15:22.413
And since you won't go to the principal,
I gotta be here to protect you.

15:22.490 --> 15:26.358
Now, take your shoes off
and put these on.

15:28.463 --> 15:31.261
Roxy, these look like nurse's shoes.

15:31.332 --> 15:33.061
Safest shoes ever made.

15:33.134 --> 15:36.501
These waxy floors
are a broken hip waiting to happen.

15:37.538 --> 15:41.770
- Nurse's shoes?
- Hey, well, look on the bright side.

15:41.843 --> 15:44.368
I'm sorry, there is no bright side to this.

16:01.629 --> 16:03.096
Poor Pablo.

16:04.098 --> 16:06.430
Oh, she's breaking his heart.

16:09.337 --> 16:12.329
Why do they always go
for the bad hombres?

16:15.209 --> 16:19.908
Hey, Dad. Look at us. We're bonding.

16:19.981 --> 16:21.414
You're right, Son.

16:21.482 --> 16:24.610
And now that we have,
let's get the heck out of here.

16:24.685 --> 16:28.621
- I'd love to but where's the snowplow?
- There is no snowplow.

16:29.791 --> 16:33.818
- Gunther?
- No, it's Franklin. Gunther's asleep.

16:35.329 --> 16:37.820
Dad, what's happening?

16:40.201 --> 16:42.863
Don't worry about it, Son.
He's probably just talking in his sleep.

16:42.937 --> 16:47.636
Oh, good work, Einstein.
Now shut your yapper and listen.

16:47.708 --> 16:50.802
He never did call for a snowplow.

16:50.878 --> 16:54.644
But there's a heater register
right behind the night stand.

16:54.715 --> 16:57.479
You can open it and get to your car.

16:58.753 --> 17:01.153
Thank you, thank you so much.

17:02.089 --> 17:03.681
What am I doing?

17:05.126 --> 17:08.857
He's right, Jackson.
Come on, we're going home.

17:08.930 --> 17:11.022
Take me with you.

17:13.166 --> 17:15.157
Okay, Dad, I know this is a little weird,

17:15.236 --> 17:18.933
but in a strange way,
he did save our lives.

17:19.006 --> 17:21.941
Listen to yourself, Son. He's a doll.

17:22.009 --> 17:25.444
You aren't so bad yourself, cowboy.

17:25.512 --> 17:28.448
Dad, in some part of his brain,
Gunther wants us to do this.

17:28.516 --> 17:30.609
But it's stealing, I think.

17:31.686 --> 17:34.246
Just leave 50 bucks on the table.

17:34.322 --> 17:37.257
He got me at a garage sale for 5.

17:37.325 --> 17:39.054
Good enough for me.

17:48.536 --> 17:50.197
Works every time.

17:55.743 --> 17:59.042
- Hey, Miley, I like that outfit.
- So did I.

17:59.113 --> 18:01.172
Until I came downstairs this morning.

18:01.249 --> 18:03.274
What happened this morning?

18:03.351 --> 18:05.148
Hey, hey, girlfriend.

18:10.191 --> 18:11.419
She's impossible.

18:11.492 --> 18:14.552
I can't talk to boys, and these
nurse's shoes are hideous,

18:14.629 --> 18:17.325
and now she's making us wear
the same clothes so if I get lost,

18:17.398 --> 18:21.095
she can tell people, "I'm looking
for someone dressed like me. "

18:21.168 --> 18:24.660
Hey, only four more years
and you can wear what you want.

18:24.739 --> 18:26.969
Unless she follows you to college.

18:27.041 --> 18:29.509
Why didn't I tell the principal
in the first place?

18:29.577 --> 18:30.908
Sure, I would've been a snitch,

18:30.978 --> 18:34.106
but I wouldn't have been a snitch
with a computer tracking device.

18:34.181 --> 18:37.582
- Say what?
- It's in my barrette!

18:37.652 --> 18:39.176
Well, it's too late to tell the principal.

18:39.253 --> 18:42.916
Now that Roxy is here, The Cracker
isn't bullying anybody anymore.

18:42.990 --> 18:44.582
I'll save you a seat at the cafeteria.

18:44.659 --> 18:48.425
And I'll cut up your lunch
into small, safe, non-chokable pieces.

18:48.496 --> 18:49.588
Great.

18:51.666 --> 18:52.963
Wait a minute.

18:53.034 --> 18:55.002
Lilly, what if Roxy
wasn't here anymore?

18:55.069 --> 18:56.730
The Cracker would bust you
like a piñata

18:56.804 --> 19:00.365
and she'd probably use
Dandruff Danny as the stick.

19:00.441 --> 19:01.635
Perfect!

19:01.709 --> 19:03.438
Am I missing something?

19:03.511 --> 19:06.173
Just meet me in the cafeteria
with the principal in five minutes.

19:06.247 --> 19:08.579
But what about Roxy?

19:08.649 --> 19:12.983
Hey, Jeanie, this barrette would look
perfect in your light brown hair.

19:13.621 --> 19:15.282
Thanks, Miley.

19:23.664 --> 19:27.293
Where is that girl going?
We don't have gym this period.

19:30.471 --> 19:33.440
<i>Okay, I've got the principal and</i>
<i>we're coming down the hall right now. </i>

19:33.507 --> 19:35.441
Great. The fox is on the move.

19:35.509 --> 19:38.000
<i>Wow, somebody thinks</i>
<i>a lot of themselves. </i>

19:38.079 --> 19:39.944
It means I'm going in.

19:42.283 --> 19:44.945
Danny, I have some bad news.

19:45.019 --> 19:46.714
Roxy was arm wrestling the principal

19:46.787 --> 19:50.484
and accidentally
snapped his wrist like a twig.

19:50.558 --> 19:54.961
- He kicked her out of school.
- Roxy got expelled? I'm doomed!

19:59.700 --> 20:02.066
Sorry to hear about your friend.

20:02.870 --> 20:05.270
Yeah, I'm helpless now.

20:06.874 --> 20:08.171
Lilly?

20:08.943 --> 20:10.069
Lilly?

20:11.245 --> 20:12.576
Mrs. Rush?

20:22.790 --> 20:26.783
Looks pretty good,
but it still needs something.

20:26.861 --> 20:29.352
Oh, yeah, nuts.

20:35.002 --> 20:38.335
- I'm late, aren't I?
- Just a smidge.

20:50.551 --> 20:52.178
You did the right thing
coming to me, girls.

20:52.253 --> 20:55.245
She's not gonna bother anyone else
in the school again.

20:55.322 --> 20:57.950
You have anything
to say for yourself, young lady?

20:58.025 --> 21:00.459
- Sorry, Stewart.
- That's okay.

21:01.862 --> 21:04.660
All right, Henrietta Laverne. Let's go.

21:07.468 --> 21:09.231
Henrietta Laverne?

21:09.303 --> 21:11.931
At least now we know
why she's so mean.

21:13.107 --> 21:14.267
Well, thank goodness that's over.

21:14.341 --> 21:17.469
I was running out of fake dangers
to protect you from.

21:17.545 --> 21:19.274
Excuse me?

21:19.346 --> 21:22.076
Oh, I only did all that stuff
to make your life so miserable

21:22.149 --> 21:25.915
that you'd go to the principal like
you should've done in the first place.

21:25.986 --> 21:28.250
So this was your plan
from the beginning?

21:28.322 --> 21:30.950
That's right.
You've heard of reverse psychology.

21:31.025 --> 21:33.459
Well, welcome to reverse Roxology.

21:34.562 --> 21:37.759
- No need to thank me, honey.
- Wait a minute.

21:37.832 --> 21:41.199
I got tossed around like a salad
so you could teach me a lesson?

21:41.268 --> 21:42.860
You never do eat your vegetables.

21:42.937 --> 21:45.838
Well, you better run
'cause Miley like a puma!

21:47.842 --> 21:50.174
Principal! Principal!
Help me! Help me!

21:55.683 --> 21:59.619
<i> By day, I play,</i>
<i>the part in every way</i>

21:59.687 --> 22:03.589
<i>Of simple, sweet, calm and collected</i>

22:04.725 --> 22:08.183
How many times have I told you?
Stop stealing my stuff.

22:11.832 --> 22:15.495
Jeez! Somebody's a little diva.

22:17.571 --> 22:19.232
Tell me about it.
