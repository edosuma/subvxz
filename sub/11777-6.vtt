<i>of the best tattoo artists</i>

Welcome to Coney Island.

[Narrator] <i> Eleven artists were</i>
<i>left in the competition...</i>

00:15.557 --> 00:18.601
You must tattoo
the inside of the mouth.

Hope nobody's
breath stinks.

<i>Clint won the</i> Flash Challenge

00:26.151 --> 00:29.237

<i>his competitors</i>

00:29.320 --> 00:30.947
<i>in the Elimination Tattoo.</i>

00:31.030 --> 00:33.450
I'm gonna try to [bleep]
as many people as I can.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.577
This is chess, not checkers.

00:35.660 --> 00:36.911
[Narrator]
<i>Tray shocked the artists</i>

00:36.995 --> 00:38.788
<i>with some dramatic news...</i>

00:38.872 --> 00:40.957
I got blood clots
and high blood pressure.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.375
I think I'll be fine.

00:42.459 --> 00:43.585
Tray!

00:43.668 --> 00:45.503
[narrator]
<i>That landed him in the ER</i>

00:45.587 --> 00:51.301
<i>At the elimination, Mark, Kay,</i>
<i>and Tray were the bottom three.</i>

00:51.384 --> 00:53.720
Tray is not here,
due to a medical emergency.

00:53.803 --> 00:57.307
Tray didn't do any texture.
His tattoo was more solid.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.767
He just didn't do any texture.

00:58.850 --> 00:59.976
Mark, you have not shown up.

01:00.059 --> 01:03.730
It's brutal, it's honest,
but it's a fact.

01:03.813 --> 01:05.272
{\an5}-Kay.

01:03.813 --> 01:05.272
-You're just not hitting it.

01:05.355 --> 01:08.151
This is not
<i>Ink Master</i> anything.

01:08.234 --> 01:11.488
The judges have decided
that Tray does not have

01:11.571 --> 01:13.865
what it takes to be <i> Ink Master</i> .

01:15.325 --> 01:16.284
[narrator]
<i>Ten artists remain,</i>

01:16.367 --> 01:20.830
<i>but only one will earn</i>
<i>a $100,000 prize,</i>

<i>and the title of</i> Ink Master <i> .</i>

02:21.808 --> 02:23.226
{\an5}-I hear--

02:21.808 --> 02:23.226
-oh!

02:23.309 --> 02:25.687
The fight just startin',
mother [bleep].

02:25.770 --> 02:27.856
{\an5}-Yes, yes.

02:25.770 --> 02:27.856
-Oh, [bleep].

02:27.939 --> 02:30.400
Of course, they gave
Jesse and Steve their props,

02:30.483 --> 02:33.486
and they got a message
for the rest of us.

02:33.570 --> 02:36.573
I don't want to see
any more badly composed tattoos.

02:36.656 --> 02:37.824
There's not a competitor

02:37.907 --> 02:39.325
that should have
any confidence right now.

02:39.409 --> 02:40.702
The real fight is coming.

02:40.785 --> 02:42.453
It's about to get turned up.

02:42.537 --> 02:43.371
It's time to fight.
It's time for everyone

02:43.454 --> 02:45.415
to start doing
what they can really do.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.917
<i>If repeatedly</i>
<i>you find yourself in the bottom,</i>

02:48.001 --> 02:49.711
<i>obviously,</i>
<i>you shouldn't be here.</i>

02:49.794 --> 02:51.796
{\an8}Go the [bleep] home.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.804
Alright, everybody,
here's the deal,

02:59.888 --> 03:02.056
Kay Kutta,
because of your background

03:02.140 --> 03:03.641
and current circumstances,

03:03.725 --> 03:07.312
you're ineligible to compete
in the <i> Flash Challenge</i> .

03:07.395 --> 03:09.856
Therefore, you will forfeit
the ability to win the advantage

03:09.939 --> 03:11.441
going into
the Elimination Tattoo.

03:11.524 --> 03:15.028
Everyone else, get ready.
See you at the Flash Challenge.

03:19.616 --> 03:21.117
What situation do you have?

03:21.200 --> 03:25.038
It's, um,
conditions of my probation.

03:26.122 --> 03:28.166
So you're on probation
right now?

03:28.249 --> 03:29.959
Yeah, I'm on federal probation
right now.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.711
What?

03:31.794 --> 03:34.464
<i>When I was 20 years old,</i>
<i>I was sentenced nine years</i>

03:34.547 --> 03:36.215
{\an8}for drug distribution
and weapons charges.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.468
<i>Because of</i>
<i>my federal probation,</i>

03:38.551 --> 03:41.471
<i>I can't possess firearms</i>
<i>or be around firearms.</i>

03:42.764 --> 03:45.558
<i>If I hadn't gone to prison,</i>
<i>we wouldn't even be talking.</i>

03:45.642 --> 03:47.268
I'd be dead.
Art and tattooing,

03:47.352 --> 03:48.353
<i>it saved my life.</i>

03:48.436 --> 03:50.355
This is a new me.
It's a rebirth.

03:50.438 --> 03:53.775
They must be about to go do
some real gangster [bleep]

03:53.858 --> 03:55.485
That I can't be
involved in it.

04:09.123 --> 04:12.001
<i>Find myself</i>
<i>in the [bleep] woods,</i>

04:12.085 --> 04:13.503
{\an8}and it's hot as [bleep].

04:13.586 --> 04:15.505
So we're going over here,
right?

04:18.548 --> 04:21.260
I don't know what the [bleep]
about to happen here.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.514
Pull!

04:27.600 --> 04:29.185
[cheering and laughter]

04:29.269 --> 04:30.353
Hoo hoo!

04:31.104 --> 04:32.146
Ten of you remain,

04:32.230 --> 04:34.857
but only one of you
will walk away with 100 grand,

04:34.941 --> 04:36.192
a feature in <i> Inked</i> magazine,

04:36.275 --> 04:38.403
and the coveted title
of <i> Ink Master</i> .

04:38.486 --> 04:41.364
As always, we kick things off
with the Flash Challenge.

04:41.447 --> 04:44.409
This week, we're testing
your attention to detail...

04:45.868 --> 04:47.370
Specifically, using
deliberate lines, shading,

04:47.453 --> 04:51.708
and proportion to finish
small details in your design

04:51.791 --> 04:55.128
that take it from being great
to being a masterpiece.

04:55.211 --> 04:58.172
{\an8}Detail is
the fine bits of your design

04:58.256 --> 05:00.883
{\an8}that pull and tie
everything together.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.176
<i>If you don't have that,</i>

05:02.260 --> 05:04.303
your tattoo's just
gonna look blah.

05:04.387 --> 05:08.558
Approximately
80 million Americans own guns,

05:08.641 --> 05:10.143
and half use them
for hunting.

05:10.226 --> 05:11.769
For today's Flash Challenge,

05:11.853 --> 05:13.062
you've been randomly assigned
a client.

05:13.146 --> 05:17.859
You'll have three hours to carve
an intricate, detailed design

05:17.942 --> 05:19.819
into the stock of their gun.

05:22.864 --> 05:23.865
{\an8}Finally, a Flash Challenge

05:23.948 --> 05:25.742
{\an8}that I have some type
of experience with.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.452
I'm hoping everybody [bleep] up.

05:27.535 --> 05:30.288
Kay Kutta is ineligible
to participate or be present

05:30.371 --> 05:33.207
at this Flash Challenge,
due to his background.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.001
Therefore,
he forfeits the possibility

05:35.084 --> 05:37.086
of winning the advantage.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.796
Let's meet your canvases.

05:42.383 --> 05:45.094
<i>I'm a little concerned</i>
<i>for our safety.</i>

05:45.178 --> 05:47.305
{\an8}These guys are scary-looking
[bleep] for sure.

05:47.388 --> 05:49.515
Few things come between
a man and his gun.

05:49.599 --> 05:53.770
This is not a canvas
that you want to screw up.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.438
{\an8}I'm pretty good with clients,
but not clients with guns.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.609
The winner
of the <i> Flash Challenge</i>

05:59.692 --> 06:01.110
will have the power
to assign

06:01.194 --> 06:03.654
all the canvases
in the Elimination Tattoo,

06:03.738 --> 06:05.490
and your time...
Begins...

06:07.200 --> 06:08.409
Pull!

06:13.956 --> 06:14.916
I knew right away
that I was getting you.

06:14.999 --> 06:17.376
I'm gonna get
the scary-looking dude for sure.

06:18.294 --> 06:20.630
I was looking for
a picture of my dog.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.090
{\an5}-A picture of your dog?

06:20.713 --> 06:22.090
-Yeah.

06:22.173 --> 06:23.841
{\an5}-Couple of deer in here.

06:22.173 --> 06:23.841
{\an3}-Okay.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.385
{\an8}To be a great tattoo
artist, you really have to know

06:26.469 --> 06:29.639
<i>how to put extreme amounts</i>
<i>of detail into a tattoo.</i>

06:29.722 --> 06:32.308
<i>We're looking for little,</i>
<i>intricate stuff, little accents,</i>

06:32.391 --> 06:33.851
<i>coupled with great lines.</i>

06:33.935 --> 06:35.686
<i>These are all elements</i>
<i>that have to go into a tattoo</i>

06:35.770 --> 06:36.979
to really make it pop.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.945
How the [bleep]
does this work?

06:44.737 --> 06:46.572
I have no idea
what I'm doing.

06:46.656 --> 06:47.990
{\an8}I'm not trying to be sexist,
or anything,

06:48.074 --> 06:49.700
but these damn girls
don't use dremels.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.702
{\an5}-[dremel whirring]

06:49.784 --> 06:51.702
-Whoa, okay.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.412
They don't even know
what the [bleep] a Dremel is.

06:55.373 --> 06:56.207
[laughter]

06:56.290 --> 06:57.750
I've never
used a Dremel before.

06:57.834 --> 07:03.339
{\an8}How am I supposed to pull off
what this man's dog looks like?

07:03.422 --> 07:05.341
It's so hard
to get these straight lines.

07:05.424 --> 07:07.260
<i>I'm freaking out.</i>

07:07.343 --> 07:09.095
You never see me
over there bitching.

07:09.178 --> 07:11.722
{\an8}I shut up, I nut up,
and I do what I'm told to do.

07:11.806 --> 07:12.723
That's how
I'm gonna go ahead

07:12.807 --> 07:15.226
and just take over
this [bleep] competition.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.606
We can go
with a nature theme.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.401
Maybe a dog
flushing some pheasant.

07:23.484 --> 07:26.028
{\an8}Man, we gotta dumb
this down a little bit.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.363
Do you have, like, a specific
style you're looking for?

07:27.446 --> 07:29.532
{\an5}-Uh, not cartoony.

07:27.446 --> 07:29.532
-Not cartoony.

07:29.615 --> 07:30.575
{\an5}-More realistic.

07:29.615 --> 07:30.575
-More realistic. Alright.

07:30.658 --> 07:33.327
He does, like,
little kids' tattoos, you know?

07:33.411 --> 07:35.288
He does
what your kid would like.

07:35.371 --> 07:36.289
{\an5}-He's in your head, man.

07:35.371 --> 07:36.289
-Who, Lalo?

07:36.372 --> 07:37.456
He's a [bleep] talker, right?

07:37.540 --> 07:39.375
{\an8}<i>I'm trying to play</i>
<i>it cool on the outside,</i>

07:39.458 --> 07:41.878
{\an8}but on the inside,
I'm freaking out.

07:46.424 --> 07:47.508
Two more hours.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.054
I know I can pull
fine-line lettering,

07:52.138 --> 07:53.806
{\an8}and I don't feel like
anybody else in the house

07:53.890 --> 07:55.892
{\an8}would be able to do this
with a Dremel.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.275
That looks sick, dude.

08:04.358 --> 08:05.484
That's why I told him,
I go, "The good news is,

08:05.568 --> 08:07.403
you and your wife are getting
the best of the bunch."

08:07.486 --> 08:09.739
I don't think
it's what they're looking for.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.741
{\an8}You don't show a lot of
detail just doing lettering.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.242
You see a
lot of clean line work,

08:13.326 --> 08:13.701
but that's not detail.

08:17.955 --> 08:19.332
Boring!

08:19.415 --> 08:21.792
I'm here to win. That's
the only reason why I'm here.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.336
Once I get rid of the people

08:23.419 --> 08:24.712
who are consistently
on the bottom,

08:24.795 --> 08:26.088
then the top guys will fall.

08:26.172 --> 08:26.547
Let's get rid of these people.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.093
Ten minutes left.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.436
Tatu Baby is giving
a really ugly,

08:40.519 --> 08:42.480
really poorly-rendered
puppy dog

08:42.563 --> 08:45.274
{\an8}to a grown-ass man
on his gun.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.360
It kinda looks kinda funny
to me, to be honest with you.

08:47.443 --> 08:49.195
It kinda looks like
more like a bunny.

08:49.278 --> 08:52.448
{\an8}I don't see any kind of detail
anywhere on that damn gun.

08:52.531 --> 08:54.825
What the [bleep]
are you thinking, man?

08:54.909 --> 08:57.495
That is a grown-ass man.
He kills [bleep] for a living.

08:57.578 --> 08:59.455
Oh, that guy's
gonna kick her ass!

09:00.373 --> 09:01.874
Let's wrap this up!

09:02.208 --> 09:06.462
10, 9, 8,

09:06.545 --> 09:07.964
7, 6,

09:08.047 --> 09:14.387
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

09:14.470 --> 09:16.389
That is it. Time's up.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.685
Jamie.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.645
{\an5}-I like this a lot.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.645
-It's easily readable.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.480
You went deep with it,
which gives it heavy contrast,

09:24.563 --> 09:26.315
and you put some fine detail
in the barb wire.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.985
And I really like
the outside border

09:29.068 --> 09:30.361
of the entire thing,

09:30.444 --> 09:32.321
with the wings being
really beveled and deep.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.365
This graphic approach,
with a little bit of stain,

09:34.448 --> 09:35.825
really reads well
from a distance.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.660
{\an5}-It's a nice job.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.660
-Thank you.

09:37.743 --> 09:38.661
Clint.

09:38.744 --> 09:41.247
I like the detail you got
in the mountain.

09:41.330 --> 09:42.999
I really wish that
you would've calligraphed out

09:43.082 --> 09:45.543
that script a little bit,
bolded that out.

09:45.626 --> 09:46.836
Mark.

09:46.919 --> 09:50.172
{\an5}-Not a whole lot of detail.

09:46.919 --> 09:50.172
-You lost it on the background.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.300
This looks like serious gouges.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.177
Steve.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.762
{\an5}-Wow.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.762
-I like the fact

09:56.846 --> 09:57.888
that it looks like an eagle,

09:57.972 --> 10:00.016
considering
what we've seen in the past.

10:00.099 --> 10:02.018
Really nice attention
to detail.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.562
I really like the way
the wing breaks the plane.

10:04.645 --> 10:06.022
And the edges
sit really straight.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.773
Super nice, man.

10:07.857 --> 10:10.860
{\an8}Steve,
that [bleep] is amazing.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.611
He is a big threat.

10:12.695 --> 10:13.863
Sarah.

10:13.946 --> 10:16.699
I like the depth that you got
by making the deer stand out,

10:16.782 --> 10:18.701
by going deeper with the carve
in the background.

10:18.784 --> 10:20.244
I mean, you got
some really nice detail

10:20.328 --> 10:23.497
happening here in the grass.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.666
I really wish more attention
to detail in the antlers,

10:25.750 --> 10:27.251
as opposed to so much detail
on the grass.

10:27.335 --> 10:30.046
It's a German roe deer.

10:30.129 --> 10:30.880
Their antlers
are a little bit different.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.798
Yeah, but it's hard
to see 'em.

10:34.216 --> 10:34.842
Sebastian.

10:34.925 --> 10:37.094
The grass in the foreground,

10:37.178 --> 10:39.388
all those fine, little lines
really give it depth.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.681
What I'm feeling like
I'm missing in this

10:40.765 --> 10:42.308
is the detail
of the tail feathers.

10:42.391 --> 10:43.893
{\an5}-Okay.

10:42.391 --> 10:43.893
-As much detail as you put

10:43.976 --> 10:45.853
in the body here,
I would've wanted to see

10:45.936 --> 10:47.021
some detail on that feather.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.524
Tatu Baby.

10:50.608 --> 10:51.400
It's a little rough, man.
It doesn't even look like

10:51.484 --> 10:53.444
you used a tool
to carve that in.

10:53.527 --> 10:56.364
Not a lot of detail
on the puppy.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.199
Lettering looks a little janky.

10:58.282 --> 11:00.117
Kinda waver a little bit,
and look a little choppy.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.536
This is one of
the messier ones.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.039
Most of us could've
carved into a picnic bench

11:05.122 --> 11:07.416
{\an8}with a pocket knife something
better than what she did.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.626
It's <i> no bueno.</i>

11:10.002 --> 11:10.920
Lalo.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.255
I like how deep
the lettering is,

11:13.339 --> 11:16.217
it looks very hard and chiseled,
but the background,

11:16.300 --> 11:17.885
the lack of detail.

11:17.968 --> 11:20.429
It looks like a little donkey
and a cactus in there.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.848
I don't know if that's
supposed to be a donkey.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.642
What's up, Jesse?

11:24.725 --> 11:27.645
I actually think that dog
came together really good,

11:27.728 --> 11:30.272
but as far as detail goes,

11:30.356 --> 11:32.233
your hunter's
getting a little bit lost.

11:32.316 --> 11:34.360
Your border outline
is just not clean,

11:34.443 --> 11:35.486
and it doesn't look
very deliberate.

11:35.569 --> 11:37.905
You missed the Mark
on the detail side of things.

11:40.866 --> 11:41.784
Alright, guys.

11:41.867 --> 11:42.660
I think that we have
a top of the heap,

11:42.743 --> 11:44.370
so first up, we had Steve.

11:44.453 --> 11:45.329
I'm super impressed.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.748
Lots of detail, man.
Lots of fine lines.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.583
Really came in
and cherried that thing out.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.544
{\an5}-You can't argue with it.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.544
-Jamie.

11:51.627 --> 11:52.753
Very graphic design.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.256
He took a completely
different approach at it.

11:55.339 --> 11:56.507
It almost looks like
a wood brand.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.467
Definitely put Jamie
at the top of the pack.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.427
Mark.

11:59.510 --> 12:02.221
Execution of the lines
was so sketchy,

12:02.304 --> 12:05.724
and the background he put on it
just [bleep] that gun up.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.852
{\an5}-Tatu Baby.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.852
-Worst one of the lot.

12:07.935 --> 12:09.937
The dog looked like a
four-year-old's crayon scribble.

12:10.020 --> 12:12.773
Rock bottom. She's underneath
the rock on this one.

12:12.857 --> 12:15.693
Alright, so I think
we got a decision here.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.528
{\an5}-I agree, I think we're clear.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.528
-Let's go tell 'em.

12:19.071 --> 12:20.656
In this Flash Challenge,
we were testing

12:20.739 --> 12:21.949
your attention to detail.

12:22.032 --> 12:26.245
There can only be one winner,
and the judges have decided.

12:28.497 --> 12:30.416
The winner of
the Flash Challenge is...

12:31.250 --> 12:32.001
Steve.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.628
[applause]

12:34.712 --> 12:35.838
Whoo.

12:35.921 --> 12:39.091
You now have the power to
assign all the human canvases

12:39.175 --> 12:40.176
in the Elimination Tattoo.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.803
{\an8}Now I have some power
to pay back some people

12:42.887 --> 12:44.513
{\an8}who tried to [bleep] me.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.348
I am coming
right at Kay Kutta.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.683
Payback is a bitch.

12:47.766 --> 12:49.351
Head back to the shop,
and get ready

12:49.435 --> 12:52.521
to meet your canvases
for the next Elimination Tattoo.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.191
What? What?

12:57.818 --> 12:59.528
{\an8}-Who won?

12:57.818 --> 12:59.528
{\an8}-[both] Steve.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.529
{\an8}I'm [bleep].

13:00.613 --> 13:02.072
But here's the twist.

13:03.407 --> 13:05.201
This is like a piece of meat
to the lion's den.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.827
It's gonna be
a [bleep] circus.

13:13.459 --> 13:16.337
{\an5}-Hey!

13:13.459 --> 13:16.337
-Hello.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.255
So what was so gangster
I couldn't come along?

13:18.339 --> 13:20.716
We got to engrave
the butts of guns.

13:20.799 --> 13:21.842
Who won?

13:21.926 --> 13:24.553
[all] Steve.

13:26.305 --> 13:27.515
I think I won a challenge.

13:27.598 --> 13:29.099
{\an5}-I won one too.

13:27.598 --> 13:29.099
-An actual <i> tattoo</i> challenge.

13:29.183 --> 13:30.893
I won a challenge
where I got to give you

13:30.976 --> 13:32.228
what you need to do, boy.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.939
No more [bleep].
It's sink or swim time.

13:35.022 --> 13:35.397
[bleep] coming at you.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.316
I'm [bleep].

13:49.995 --> 13:53.541
Welcome to this week's
<i>Elimination Tattoo</i> .

13:53.624 --> 13:55.584
Succeed, and you'll be
one step closer

13:55.668 --> 13:56.877
to the title of <i> Ink Master.</i>

13:56.961 --> 14:00.089
Screw it up,
and you're headed home.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.632
You will be judged
by the three of us,

14:01.715 --> 14:04.134
and you'll also be judged
by all of America.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.886
Viewers at home will vote for
the tattoo they think is best,

14:05.970 --> 14:09.598
using the same criteria
that the judges use.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.308
For this
Elimination Tattoo,

14:11.392 --> 14:13.352
we're testing
your attention to detail.

14:13.435 --> 14:16.605
This week, you must tattoo
one of my favorite images,

14:16.689 --> 14:16.897
a pinup.

14:18.524 --> 14:19.525
Ooh.

14:19.608 --> 14:22.194
[laughter]

14:22.278 --> 14:23.946
Details in pinups
are super important,

14:24.029 --> 14:26.407
{\an8}because the proportions
are so small.

14:26.490 --> 14:28.576
It's a very delicate
process.

14:28.659 --> 14:30.786
Pinup girls date back
to World War II.

14:30.869 --> 14:32.788
Early pinup girls
wore more clothing,

14:32.871 --> 14:34.039
but as the decades passed,

14:34.123 --> 14:36.500
the clothing became
more seductive and provocative.

14:36.584 --> 14:39.461
The pinup can be
in any style,

14:39.545 --> 14:40.629
but here's the twist--

14:41.714 --> 14:43.841
the reference material
you use for your design

14:43.924 --> 14:47.094
are the pictures you'll take
during your photo shoot.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.598
This is going to be
really tough.

14:50.681 --> 14:52.641
{\an8}When you're using a model,
you're actually

14:52.725 --> 14:54.310
working with the model
to get the right expression,

14:54.393 --> 14:55.811
to get the right pose.

14:55.894 --> 14:57.271
{\an8}I've done
photo shoots before.

14:57.354 --> 14:59.189
{\an8}I've never done a photo
shoot with ten people.

14:59.273 --> 15:02.109
It's gonna be
a [bleep] circus.

15:02.192 --> 15:04.445
The model for your tattoo
has appeared on the pages

15:04.528 --> 15:06.655
of some of the most well-known
adult magazines.

15:06.739 --> 15:07.448
Hmm.

15:07.531 --> 15:08.490
She performs burlesque.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.868
Please welcome Darenzia.

15:11.994 --> 15:12.703
Hey, guys.

15:12.786 --> 15:14.705
[cheers and applause]

15:14.788 --> 15:15.956
Thanks for joining us.

15:16.040 --> 15:16.081
{\an8}Darenzia's hot.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.424
This is like a piece of meat
to the lion's den.

15:26.842 --> 15:30.012
Darenzia is your pinup model
for this Elimination Tattoo.

15:30.095 --> 15:30.846
You must use
the pictures you take

15:30.929 --> 15:33.307
during your
30-minute photo shoot

15:33.390 --> 15:34.683
as the reference material
for your design.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.685
If you screw up
the pictures,

15:36.769 --> 15:39.188
your tattoo
doesn't stand a chance.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.190
Now, let's meet
your canvases.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.030
Steve, since you won
the Flash Challenge,

15:48.113 --> 15:50.991
you now have the power
to assign all human canvases.

15:51.075 --> 15:55.204
This is your chance
to stack the deck. Be ruthless.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.039
My strategy
is to get rid of the people

15:57.122 --> 15:58.749
who are not strong enough
to be here.

15:58.832 --> 16:00.626
{\an8}Kay Kutta,
I'm coming right at him.

16:00.709 --> 16:03.212
{\an5}-What do you got?

16:00.709 --> 16:03.212
-1950s aviation pinup.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.089
Anybody that uses me
as a target

16:05.172 --> 16:06.423
{\an8}pretty much
be wasting bullets.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.175
No matter what you get,
you should be ready

16:08.258 --> 16:08.884
when it come time
to blaze your guns.

16:08.967 --> 16:10.302
{\an5}-A football theme.

16:08.967 --> 16:10.302
-Where?

16:10.386 --> 16:11.762
{\an5}-Ribs.

16:10.386 --> 16:11.762
-Ah.

16:11.845 --> 16:14.348
{\an5}-[whistles]

16:11.845 --> 16:14.348
-The louder he talks,

16:14.431 --> 16:15.557
{\an8}the more insecure he is.

16:15.641 --> 16:16.767
He doesn't have the confidence
in his own ability,

16:16.850 --> 16:18.560
so I'm gonna help him leave.

16:18.644 --> 16:19.895
How can I be afraid of Steve?

16:19.978 --> 16:20.854
{\an8}Look at the guy.
His wardrobe

16:20.938 --> 16:23.649
just doesn't allow me
to feel that way.

16:23.732 --> 16:26.193
{\an5}-What do you want to get, man?

16:23.732 --> 16:26.193
-I'm going ribs too.

16:26.276 --> 16:29.697
{\an8}Bingo. Now, he's gonna have
to prove that he belongs here.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.657
I ain't scared of no ribs,
playboy.

16:31.740 --> 16:32.616
Let me get it.

16:32.700 --> 16:33.117
That's yours.

16:37.996 --> 16:39.206
Canvases, one by one,

16:39.289 --> 16:41.583
reveal the name
on the bottom of your skull.

16:41.667 --> 16:42.918
Sebastian.

16:43.001 --> 16:43.961
Clint.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.170
Mark.

16:45.254 --> 16:45.504
Sarah.

16:45.587 --> 16:46.296
Lalo.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.215
Jamie.

16:48.298 --> 16:50.050
{\an8}Steve gives me the rib cage.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.136
I'm flattered
that people continue

16:52.219 --> 16:53.345
trying to throw me
under the bus.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.431
I got broad shoulders,
so pile that [bleep] on.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.099
Tatu Baby.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.225
Jesse.

16:58.308 --> 16:59.935
Steve.

17:00.018 --> 17:01.145
Kay Kutta.

17:03.522 --> 17:04.690
I knew he was gonna
give me the ribs.

17:04.772 --> 17:06.400
{\an8}The guy has darker skin.
I think,

17:06.483 --> 17:08.318
{\an8}Steve is gonna think
that's a challenge for me.

17:08.402 --> 17:09.486
Kay Kutta, you just
don't have the skill set.

17:09.569 --> 17:10.612
{\an8}It's time to go home.

17:10.695 --> 17:11.780
I'm gonna go home...

17:11.864 --> 17:13.490
{\an8}With an extra suitcase...

17:13.574 --> 17:15.951
{\an8}Full of money.

17:16.034 --> 17:18.787
You have 30 minutes to consult
with your human canvas

17:18.871 --> 17:20.079
before your photo shoot
with Darenzia.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.290
Darenzia will be posing
in one outfit,

17:22.374 --> 17:25.627
so any specific clothing or
props that your client requests

17:25.711 --> 17:27.421
must be drawn in.

17:27.503 --> 17:29.965
Then you will have five hours
to tattoo your pinup.

17:30.048 --> 17:32.593
Ultimately,
based on your work,

17:32.676 --> 17:34.845
one of you
will be closing up shop.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.221
Good luck.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.141
{\an8}If you're doing
a head-to-toe pinup,

17:39.224 --> 17:41.560
{\an8}it all involves
intricate detail.

17:41.643 --> 17:44.146
Everything has to be just right,
from the hair to the toes.

17:44.229 --> 17:47.775
You mess it up in any way,
you destroy the pinup.

17:47.858 --> 17:49.109
We gotta think about
some spots, man.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.152
Let me see your ribs.
Let me see what they look like.

17:50.235 --> 17:52.780
{\an8}I meet my canvas,
and he wants a geisha pinup,

17:52.863 --> 17:55.491
and the design options
are basically up to me.

17:55.574 --> 17:56.825
Yeah, too muscular, man.
It's not gonna--

17:56.909 --> 17:58.160
Too muscular
for the ribs, right?

17:58.243 --> 17:59.328
Yeah, exactly.
All that's gonna

17:59.411 --> 18:01.455
change my dimensions,
all the muscles and stuff.

18:01.538 --> 18:03.791
{\an8}Kay Kutta,
in true form of a pussy

18:03.874 --> 18:06.001
<i>makes his canvas</i>
<i>move the tattoo</i>

18:06.085 --> 18:08.837
<i>for no [bleep] reason</i>
<i>whatsoever,</i>

18:08.921 --> 18:11.465
other than the fact that
he knows that he can't hang.

18:11.548 --> 18:14.009
Outside of the calf.
Unflexed, let me see.

18:14.092 --> 18:15.636
{\an8}I don't care
if the other artists think

18:15.719 --> 18:17.679
{\an8}that I'm switching from the ribs
to make it easier on myself.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.973
<i>I'm gonna do what I gotta do</i>
<i>to stay in this competition.</i>

18:20.057 --> 18:21.600
{\an5}-Is the arm too thin?

18:20.057 --> 18:21.600
-Arm, same deal.

18:21.683 --> 18:24.561
Let's change it. I need
something flat and smooth.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.396
<i>Quit being a little bitch.</i>
<i>Do your job.</i>

18:26.480 --> 18:28.273
{\an8}Put the goddamn tattoo
where it's supposed to be.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.900
Would thigh be an option?

18:29.983 --> 18:32.528
{\an5}-Nah, it's too feminine.

18:29.983 --> 18:32.528
-No? Okay.

18:32.611 --> 18:36.406
Alright, so we're going on
left rib cage.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.283
{\an4}-Yeah.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.283
-Alright, let's hear it.

18:38.367 --> 18:39.451
What kind of
a [bleep] <i> Ink Master</i> are you

18:39.535 --> 18:42.788
{\an8}if you can't tattoo what
they want, where they want it?

18:42.871 --> 18:43.872
Being on the side
of the body there,

18:43.956 --> 18:47.626
I really want to get
some kind of a...

18:47.709 --> 18:49.127
More lateral motion to it.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.796
I'm doing it
right on the rib cage,

18:50.879 --> 18:52.965
right what he asked for,
and my [bleep] gonna be clean.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.675
I'm not uncomfortable
doing it on your ribs.

18:54.758 --> 18:57.302
It'll be just fine.

18:57.386 --> 18:58.762
Where are we getting this?
On your calf?

18:58.846 --> 19:00.264
{\an5}-Right here.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.264
-Inside of the calf?

19:00.347 --> 19:02.057
Okay, and you want a girl
playing the piano?

19:02.140 --> 19:05.018
{\an5}-Yeah.

19:02.140 --> 19:05.018
-This particular challenge

19:05.102 --> 19:06.353
{\an8}is gonna be difficult for me.

19:06.436 --> 19:08.730
<i>The last time I remember</i>
<i>doing a pinup is ten years ago.</i>

19:08.814 --> 19:11.400
I really wanted her in,
like, bow-tie,

19:11.483 --> 19:11.984
suspenders, like, a top hat.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.277
And it's black and grey.

19:13.360 --> 19:16.613
That's two elements that
I haven't done in a long time.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.282
We're gonna have to
minimalize a lot.

19:18.365 --> 19:20.242
I mean, the girl herself
is gonna take five hours.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.201
{\an8}Everybody is anxious to see

19:21.285 --> 19:23.078
{\an8}how Jesse's gonna do
with black and gray.

19:23.161 --> 19:26.081
<i>All eyes are on Jesse</i>
<i>on this one.</i>

19:26.164 --> 19:27.875
It's gonna be tough.

19:29.209 --> 19:30.377
<i>I'm nervous</i>
<i>that we're gonna have</i>

19:30.460 --> 19:32.212
<i>this pinup only for 30 minutes.</i>

19:32.296 --> 19:35.340
{\an8}So how are we all gonna
pull off having her pose for us

19:35.424 --> 19:36.925
if we all are gonna have
different poses?

19:37.009 --> 19:37.175
Take the cap off.

19:39.511 --> 19:40.762
There she is.

19:45.517 --> 19:46.268
{\an5}-This is torture.

19:45.517 --> 19:46.268
-You ain't lying.

19:51.356 --> 19:54.484
{\an5}-Go, we only have 30 minutes.

19:51.356 --> 19:54.484
-Kay, get out of my way.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.409
{\an8}Oh! She looks amazing.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.622
Alright, pretend you love Clint.

20:06.705 --> 20:07.748
You're all about the Mohawk.

20:07.831 --> 20:09.625
Why can't we do this
in all the challenges?

20:10.667 --> 20:12.711
Look here.

20:12.794 --> 20:14.963
{\an8}I need to design something
that fits the time frame.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.966
I'm terrible with time, so
I'm probably gonna be in trouble

20:18.050 --> 20:19.468
if I don't
keep things simple.

20:19.551 --> 20:20.969
Can I get you
playing a piano?

20:21.053 --> 20:22.179
Kind of, like,

20:22.262 --> 20:24.681
tweaked out as much as possible.
Bend your back.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.433
{\an8}We have three hours
to get prepared.

20:26.516 --> 20:29.102
I'm not quite sure
that I can have it all ready

20:29.186 --> 20:31.146
within that time limit.
I'm really worried.

20:43.241 --> 20:44.117
So what do you think?

20:44.201 --> 20:46.203
I think your [bleep]
better than mine.

20:46.286 --> 20:49.831
Steve, you think
that head's too big?

20:49.915 --> 20:50.791
I feel really good,
going into the pinups.

20:50.874 --> 20:52.042
A lot of people [bleep] up
on the face.

20:52.125 --> 20:54.503
{\an5}-It look weird.

20:52.125 --> 20:54.503
-Does that look weird?

20:54.586 --> 20:56.630
Yeah, it looks like
a carnival ride.

20:56.713 --> 20:58.048
So I know
I can beat these people.

20:58.131 --> 21:00.092
I haven't done one of these
in, like, ten years.

21:01.760 --> 21:02.386
I'm glad
I see Jesse struggling.

21:02.469 --> 21:04.137
If you can't handle it, get out.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.973
I'm here to win. That is it.

21:08.266 --> 21:11.019
Today, you must tattoo a pinup.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.229
We're testing
your attention to detail.

21:12.312 --> 21:15.107
If your girl isn't hot,
you're going home.

21:15.190 --> 21:18.402
You have five hours
to tattoo,

21:18.485 --> 21:20.362
and your time starts...

21:20.445 --> 21:22.656
{\an5}-Now.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.656
-Alright, my brother.

21:22.739 --> 21:24.324
Let's go, baby.
Let's do this.

21:24.408 --> 21:27.119
{\an8}A pinup, typically, is
the most unforgiving of designs.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.746
It all involves
intricate detail,

21:29.830 --> 21:31.623
and you can't mess up
on anything.

21:31.707 --> 21:34.334
Everything has to be just right,
from the hair to the toes.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.920
If anything is off,
you botched the pinup.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.839
Looks perfect.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.133
If we could
round the butt off

21:41.216 --> 21:42.259
and maybe hike 'em up
just a hair.

21:42.342 --> 21:43.719
You want to bring
the garters up higher?

21:43.802 --> 21:45.554
Yeah.

21:45.637 --> 21:46.722
{\an8}My canvas is being overly picky.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.015
I just want to make sure

21:48.098 --> 21:49.975
I didn't get some little
pencil body on there.

21:50.058 --> 21:51.643
You know how small
that girl is.

21:51.727 --> 21:52.894
Oh, no, I definitely had to

21:52.978 --> 21:54.021
{\an5}-muscle her up a little bit.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.021
-No, yeah, I want some--

21:54.104 --> 21:55.564
I think it's a trust issue,

21:55.647 --> 21:56.565
but he's got no choice.

21:56.648 --> 21:57.941
He's just gonna
have to trust me.

21:58.025 --> 22:00.402
I'll go run a copy,
and then we'll stick it on you.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.237
He's gonna have to just
go along for the ride,

22:02.320 --> 22:03.530
and let me [bleep]
drive the bus.

22:03.613 --> 22:04.448
That's what I'm here to do.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.869
My canvas
is really not fighting me

22:08.952 --> 22:10.662
{\an8}on moving from the ribs
to the calf.

22:10.746 --> 22:13.165
I can imagine how this
on the ribs would look, though.

22:13.248 --> 22:14.082
[laughs]

22:14.166 --> 22:16.543
{\an5}-What's going on, man?

22:14.166 --> 22:16.543
-Oh. It's good.

22:16.626 --> 22:18.420
Steve tried to [bleep] me,
but he really threw me

22:18.503 --> 22:20.338
a pretty nice toss,
so joke's on you, Jack.

22:22.632 --> 22:23.884
So far so good.

22:23.967 --> 22:25.802
I am definitely one of the top
tattoo artists in the house.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.846
{\an8}I probably can't even count
how many Navy pinups I've done.

22:27.929 --> 22:29.181
I'm gonna kill it.

22:29.264 --> 22:30.599
Think there's gonna be
a lot of bad [bleep]?

22:30.682 --> 22:33.226
Uh, I've walked around.
I've seen a couple.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.228
Kay Kutta,
I'm gonna help you go home.

22:35.312 --> 22:37.439
Four hours left.
That's one hour down.

22:43.820 --> 22:46.114
I think a lot of the guys
would've been scared

22:46.198 --> 22:49.117
to try this on the side.
It's an intimidating spot

22:49.201 --> 22:50.535
for some people
of lower ability levels.

22:50.619 --> 22:54.831
My strategy at this point
in the game is to try to win.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.625
My pinup girl
is gonna be solid.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.043
All my lines are clean.

22:58.126 --> 23:00.087
I'm gonna have
by far the most detail.

23:00.170 --> 23:00.879
It's going to be [bleep] epic.

23:00.962 --> 23:03.006
I can't miss.

23:03.882 --> 23:05.008
It's three hours to go.

23:06.384 --> 23:08.261
Halfway through
the tattoo, I realize

23:08.345 --> 23:09.971
{\an8}those legs took me too long.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.681
Cool legs.

23:11.765 --> 23:12.891
{\an5}-[laughs]

23:11.765 --> 23:12.891
-I know.

23:12.974 --> 23:14.434
{\an5}-Got two hours.

23:12.974 --> 23:14.434
-Lalo...

23:14.518 --> 23:16.019
...he's way behind
everybody in this challenge.

23:16.103 --> 23:18.647
Time is--
is a problem.

23:19.940 --> 23:22.275
Dude, that is [bleep] scary!

23:22.359 --> 23:23.652
I don't think
it's the worst one.

23:23.735 --> 23:25.153
{\an5}-It is.

23:23.735 --> 23:25.153
-You think it's the worst one?

23:25.237 --> 23:27.989
The face,
it looks like Chucky.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.829
I know that I was in the bottom
for the <i> Flash Challenge,</i>

23:33.912 --> 23:35.205
{\an8}but that's just
gonna make me push harder

23:35.288 --> 23:36.665
{\an8}for this Elimination Tattoo.

23:36.748 --> 23:40.293
I tried sharpening in every
single detail of that tattoo,

23:40.377 --> 23:42.129
and making it look
very bulletproof.

23:42.212 --> 23:45.507
I'm gonna show detail, I'm gonna
do her very curvaceous.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.008
You added a little booty
to it, looks like.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.010
Yeah, he wanted booty.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.095
{\an5}-I can do booty.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.095
-[laughs]

23:50.178 --> 23:52.681
This is, like, a super comeback.

23:52.764 --> 23:53.598
They want detail,
I'm gonna give 'em detail.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.269
My canvas is doing great.

23:57.352 --> 23:59.646
He's laying still as a board.

24:08.196 --> 24:10.073
{\an8}I've been worried about wowing
the judges with huge tattoos.

24:10.157 --> 24:12.325
Hasn't been working out for me.

24:12.409 --> 24:14.494
This time, I'm gonna do
an average-size tattoo,

24:14.578 --> 24:16.079
and make sure
I get it done in time.

24:16.163 --> 24:16.913
In order to stay
in the competition,

24:16.997 --> 24:20.208
I need to produce
a solid tattoo.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.961
One hour remains,
everybody.

24:29.217 --> 24:31.678
{\an8}As I'm tattooing,
I'm just totally vibing.

24:31.761 --> 24:33.471
{\an8}Like, this is what I do.

24:33.555 --> 24:35.056
She's looking good.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.349
Pinups are
one of my specialties.

24:36.433 --> 24:39.936
This tattoo, it's dynamic,
it's got a lot of motion to it.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.521
I'm pretty confident.

24:41.605 --> 24:44.107
Perfect.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.192
Black and grey, man.
How you feeling?

24:45.275 --> 24:46.276
Maybe I should've
went color.

24:46.359 --> 24:48.612
{\an8}It's my first pinup
in ten years,

24:48.695 --> 24:50.572
{\an8}and I think I need
a little more practice.

24:50.655 --> 24:53.033
Think even back when
I used to do this type of stuff,

24:53.116 --> 24:55.619
I would never try
to do a face that small.

24:55.702 --> 24:57.078
Jesse's just doesn't have

24:57.162 --> 24:58.705
{\an8}really smooth
black and grey skills.

24:58.788 --> 25:01.958
He's having a really hard time
getting the shading.

25:02.042 --> 25:03.585
The whole thing
just looks bad.

25:04.794 --> 25:05.962
How are you doing over there?

25:06.046 --> 25:07.047
Good.

25:07.130 --> 25:09.049
Jesse's tattoo
is an abomination.

25:09.132 --> 25:10.592
It's awful.

25:10.675 --> 25:13.470
If you want a real <i> Ink Master</i> ,
then Jesse should go home.

25:16.348 --> 25:17.265
Got, like, ten minutes.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.643
How long?
Time feels like

25:19.726 --> 25:22.312
it's dripping away
faster than I want to.

25:22.395 --> 25:24.522
{\an5}-Six minutes, bro.

25:22.395 --> 25:24.522
-Thank you.

25:24.606 --> 25:25.523
I have to finish.

25:25.607 --> 25:26.858
I'm not gonna do
another unfinished tattoo,

25:26.942 --> 25:31.488
but the fact is, I'm not gonna
be able to finish super detail,

25:31.571 --> 25:35.450
super clean,
how I like to do my tattoos.

25:36.785 --> 25:40.497
That's 10, 9, 8,

25:40.580 --> 25:43.625
7, 6, 5,

25:43.708 --> 25:46.586
4, 3, 2, 1.

25:46.670 --> 25:51.258
That's it, time's up.
Machines down. No more ink.

25:51.341 --> 25:52.884
Alright, we better win
this [bleep].

25:52.968 --> 25:54.302
Let's do this.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.887
That would be pretty
[bleep] up if I won, right?

25:55.971 --> 25:58.056
I feel like I dropped the ball
on this one.

25:58.139 --> 25:58.890
This tattoo could definitely

25:58.974 --> 26:01.226
knock me out
of this competition.

26:01.309 --> 26:02.602
{\an5}-Like her?

26:01.309 --> 26:02.602
-Mm-hmm.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.020
I know I'm gonna end up
in the bottom.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.563
I'm hoping
that Mark does terrible,

26:05.647 --> 26:08.733
and he will be the one
who is gonna get eliminated.

26:08.817 --> 26:09.651
{\an5}-Ready?

26:08.817 --> 26:09.651
-Ready.

26:11.945 --> 26:13.822
I'm really not happy
with my tattoo at all.

26:13.905 --> 26:15.740
It looks too dark.
The areas that I was trying

26:15.824 --> 26:17.367
to get the tight detail in,
missed the mark.

26:17.450 --> 26:19.786
I could very well
be going home.

26:19.869 --> 26:20.912
[Bleep]!

26:20.996 --> 26:24.249
[sighs]

26:24.332 --> 26:25.542
{\an8}Your tattoo
was [bleep] too dark,

26:25.625 --> 26:29.170
{\an8}but they did not say
[bleep] about hers!

26:29.254 --> 26:31.089
Here's the problem, man,
if you look at that hand,

26:31.172 --> 26:32.966
and don't think
it looks [bleep],

26:33.049 --> 26:34.759
then that's the problem!

26:42.100 --> 26:43.518
Kay's been so comparative
with everybody,

26:43.601 --> 26:46.187
he's good at [bleep] talking,
basically.

26:46.271 --> 26:47.689
Kay's playing a good game.

26:47.772 --> 26:48.773
Like, I didn't think
he was gonna make it this far.

26:48.857 --> 26:52.193
I thought he was gonna be gone
on the third week.

26:52.277 --> 26:53.862
I mean, he's probably playing
more of a strategic game

26:53.945 --> 26:54.529
than any of us are.

26:54.612 --> 26:56.197
He's the one that has to.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.199
He's worried
about everybody else.

26:58.283 --> 26:59.534
There's where
the flaw in his game.

26:59.617 --> 27:01.411
<i>My philosophy is,</i>
<i>"You deserve to go home,</i>

27:01.494 --> 27:02.871
<i>I'm gonna help you</i>
<i>go home."</i>

27:02.954 --> 27:03.955
It's time for him to go.

27:04.039 --> 27:05.707
He's loud,
I'm the same way.

27:05.790 --> 27:08.460
Difference is, I'm loud
'cause I'm intelligent.

27:08.543 --> 27:10.879
[laughter]

27:25.643 --> 27:27.645
This week,
we asked you to tattoo a pinup

27:27.729 --> 27:30.940
as gorgeous as the real thing,
based solely on your photos.

27:31.024 --> 27:32.650
We were testing
your attention to detail.

27:34.444 --> 27:37.405
Sarah, let's start with you.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.656
How was the photo shoot
for you?

27:38.740 --> 27:41.034
I tend to try and work
a little bit more one-on-one

27:41.117 --> 27:44.204
with the model, but I think
what happened was pretty good.

27:44.287 --> 27:45.080
It's a beautiful tattoo,

27:45.163 --> 27:46.164
but I have a lot of problems
with it.

27:46.247 --> 27:47.415
Her legs look squatty.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.667
If you look at a hula dancer,

27:49.751 --> 27:50.460
their legs are really,
really thick.

27:50.543 --> 27:53.505
Pinup class 101,
you make the legs

27:53.588 --> 27:55.215
a little longer
than they really should be,

27:55.298 --> 27:56.216
'cause it's aesthetically
pleasing.

27:56.299 --> 27:57.592
If you would
elongate those legs,

27:57.675 --> 27:58.676
and stretch her body out,

27:58.760 --> 28:00.178
it'd give her
a little more sexy feel.

28:00.261 --> 28:01.679
I like what I did.

28:01.763 --> 28:03.181
The problem that I have
in the face,

28:03.264 --> 28:04.307
is that one buck tooth.

28:04.391 --> 28:07.435
It looks like just one tooth
sticking out of the lip,

28:07.519 --> 28:09.020
and it throws the face off.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.605
I know
you're going for the detail,

28:10.688 --> 28:12.607
but when you work that hard
on the face,

28:12.690 --> 28:14.067
and put that much into it,

28:14.150 --> 28:16.611
sometimes in that little area,
less is more.

28:19.322 --> 28:20.698
Tatu Baby.

28:23.326 --> 28:25.703
The pie being held like that,
why did you make that choice?

28:25.787 --> 28:27.580
My client tells me
he's an ass man.

28:27.664 --> 28:28.873
He wants the pinup to be
from the rear,

28:28.957 --> 28:32.043
but still want to be able to
see her holding the pie.

28:32.127 --> 28:33.378
The pie bugs me.

28:33.461 --> 28:34.629
You're not gonna hold the pie
up on its end.

28:34.712 --> 28:35.672
I don't care about the pie,

28:35.755 --> 28:37.132
'cause I can't stop looking
at the ass.

28:37.215 --> 28:39.801
It takes a lot of guts
to go into a face that dark

28:39.884 --> 28:42.387
and commit to that.
A lot of people in here

28:42.470 --> 28:44.973
are scared to put shading
where it belongs and own it.

28:45.056 --> 28:46.474
You are not.
I love this tattoo.

28:46.558 --> 28:48.393
I think you did a great job.

28:48.476 --> 28:49.602
Thanks.

28:51.187 --> 28:53.481
Clint.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.108
I [bleep] love this thing.

28:55.191 --> 28:57.735
I love all the detail,
I love all the tattoos,

28:57.819 --> 28:59.195
and she's sexy as hell.

28:59.279 --> 29:01.739
The things that stand out,
the face, the shoes, the hands,

29:01.823 --> 29:04.284
all the things that people
struggle with, you nailed it.

29:04.367 --> 29:05.660
You did good, man.
It's a cool one,

29:05.743 --> 29:07.537
and I like your fighting style.

29:07.620 --> 29:08.997
I'm not giving up.
I know where I belong.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.165
I know what I can do.

29:10.248 --> 29:11.332
You've showed us
your technical tattooing.

29:11.416 --> 29:12.667
Now, it's just a matter
of getting your drawing right.

29:12.750 --> 29:15.295
Yeah, and I think
it's a lot better for me

29:15.378 --> 29:17.088
if I just, instead of trying
go out of my element,

29:17.172 --> 29:17.964
just do what I do.

29:20.758 --> 29:21.676
Lalo.

29:22.635 --> 29:25.013
This is a detail challenge.

29:25.096 --> 29:27.265
We're here looking for
fine line details.

29:27.348 --> 29:29.851
This tattoo has
very little detail at all.

29:29.934 --> 29:33.313
The little strap of her dress
is just scritchy-scratch lines

29:33.396 --> 29:34.606
that don't connect.

29:34.689 --> 29:36.274
I hate to say this,
but I ran out of time.

29:36.357 --> 29:38.359
Now, if we look at the hand
that she's holding up,

29:38.443 --> 29:40.778
you tried to put a little detail
in her fingernails,

29:40.862 --> 29:42.405
but the fingernails are, like,

29:42.489 --> 29:45.241
growing off the tip of
her finger like they're claws,

29:45.325 --> 29:48.036
and this is probably
the ugliest face of the day.

29:49.078 --> 29:50.914
Damn! It's killing me.

29:50.997 --> 29:52.874
I'm trying not to lose my mind.

29:52.957 --> 29:56.044
I know the face didn't
come out as I was expected.

29:56.127 --> 29:59.214
This is a bad, bad time
to drop the ball,

29:59.297 --> 30:00.548
and to come in with this?

30:00.632 --> 30:02.467
There's other people
that should probably go home,

30:02.550 --> 30:03.551
but they might get
a second chance,

30:03.635 --> 30:05.178
just 'cause you [bleep] up.

30:07.555 --> 30:08.515
Jesse.

30:10.475 --> 30:12.894
Everything you've done
has been extremely detailed,

30:12.977 --> 30:15.188
and then here's
the detail challenge,

30:15.271 --> 30:16.147
and so we don't have it.

30:16.231 --> 30:17.941
That's just weird, dude.
What happened?

30:18.024 --> 30:19.192
Even back
when I used to do pinups,

30:19.275 --> 30:21.361
I would never
do a pinup this small.

30:21.444 --> 30:22.570
It's the trick.
You can still show the detail

30:22.654 --> 30:25.198
in whatever size the tattoo
would be.

30:25.281 --> 30:27.534
Saying that it's too small,
I'm not buying it.

30:27.617 --> 30:29.494
Her right hand
is just another one

30:29.577 --> 30:30.411
of the totally jacked hands
that we have.

30:30.495 --> 30:31.788
You lost it on this.

30:31.871 --> 30:34.749
Goddamn, this thing
looks like it hurts.

30:34.832 --> 30:38.336
It is so red and just beat
that it looks painful.

30:38.419 --> 30:39.337
It looks like you took water

30:39.420 --> 30:41.923
and marked out
where you were gonna shade,

30:42.006 --> 30:43.925
and then tried to run shading
over the top of it.

30:44.008 --> 30:46.928
You should be that guy
that can do it all.

30:47.011 --> 30:48.972
How can't you do
these basics?

30:52.267 --> 30:53.935
Jamie.

30:54.018 --> 30:54.936
So what did your client want?

30:55.019 --> 30:56.938
A football player pinup
on his ribs.

30:57.021 --> 31:00.108
This Jersey and this outfit
is awesome.

31:00.191 --> 31:02.277
I like the attention to detail
in the face.

31:02.360 --> 31:05.113
You showed people in this room
how to do a face.

31:05.196 --> 31:06.739
You did simple hair,
but you did nice strands in it.

31:06.823 --> 31:07.907
I'm back in my groove,
I think.

31:07.991 --> 31:10.493
You did it on the ribs.
It's just as clean

31:10.577 --> 31:11.452
on the ribs
as it would have been

31:11.536 --> 31:12.203
on the arm, and that shows us

31:12.287 --> 31:13.663
that you know what you're doing.

31:17.125 --> 31:17.917
Sebastian.

31:20.878 --> 31:22.964
You did a great, nice,
detailed outfit,

31:23.047 --> 31:24.966
I just wish there was
a hot chick wearing it.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.803
She is rough-looking, man.

31:28.886 --> 31:31.806
The cross between the hot,
young girl with voluptuous tits,

31:31.889 --> 31:34.976
and the old lady
in the hands and the throat,

31:35.059 --> 31:36.144
it's weird-looking to me.

31:36.227 --> 31:38.479
I feel like,
at 14 years of tattooing,

31:38.563 --> 31:39.647
you know
how to do a pinup girl.

31:39.731 --> 31:40.648
I don't do pinups really.

31:40.732 --> 31:41.774
I mean, that's not something
that I get.

31:41.858 --> 31:42.483
So what have you done
for 14 years?

31:42.567 --> 31:44.861
I do a lot of portraits.

31:44.944 --> 31:46.821
If you do portraits,
you know how to do hair.

31:46.904 --> 31:48.323
There was no detail
in that hair.

31:48.406 --> 31:49.490
I did what I saw.

31:49.574 --> 31:51.159
No, because I know
you can do better.

31:51.242 --> 31:53.494
I'm glad I'm getting rid of
the stuff I'm not that great at.

31:53.578 --> 31:54.537
Man, it's <i> Ink Master.</i>

31:54.621 --> 31:57.332
You have to be that guy
that can do it all.

31:57.415 --> 31:58.833
I looked at you as a guy
who was gonna give

31:58.916 --> 32:00.918
a couple of the other guys
the run.

32:01.002 --> 32:02.086
We have issues.

32:04.255 --> 32:05.173
Mark.

32:07.550 --> 32:09.927
There's been a few tattoos
you've done in this competition

32:10.011 --> 32:11.179
where we've said
it looked like a cover-up.

32:11.262 --> 32:15.224
This time, you actually did
a cover-up of your own detail.

32:15.308 --> 32:17.894
The detail in the jacket,
the boots,

32:17.977 --> 32:19.437
the hair, the cigarette,
now the tattoo's done,

32:19.520 --> 32:20.938
can't see any of it.

32:21.022 --> 32:22.523
Man, that was
a ten-hour day for us.

32:22.607 --> 32:23.608
My hand was killing me.

32:23.691 --> 32:26.069
I was beat the [bleep] up.

32:26.152 --> 32:28.154
I broke my thumb
right before I came in.

32:28.237 --> 32:30.782
I completely underestimated
how much it was gonna affect me.

32:30.865 --> 32:33.242
If you don't feel like
being here, throw in the towel.

32:33.326 --> 32:34.911
You owe your clients.
You owe the person

32:34.994 --> 32:37.121
that you're gonna
put something on forever

32:37.205 --> 32:38.998
the respect
that you demand for yourself,

32:39.082 --> 32:40.375
but if you can't run
a clean outline,

32:40.458 --> 32:42.502
then please don't.

32:46.339 --> 32:48.007
Steve.

32:51.302 --> 32:53.096
You did this Navy pinup.
Why did you select him?

32:53.179 --> 32:55.223
I'm from a Navy town,
he was in the Navy,

32:55.306 --> 32:57.100
he wanted black and grey,
so it just seemed to fit.

32:57.183 --> 32:59.894
I love the fact that you were
able to pack so much detail

32:59.977 --> 33:01.729
into such a simple design.

33:01.813 --> 33:02.689
This is how
it's supposed to be done.

33:02.772 --> 33:05.400
This is the right way
to shade a figure.

33:05.483 --> 33:06.484
Use the light and dark.

33:06.567 --> 33:08.194
You really are
the shining example

33:08.277 --> 33:08.778
for how to do a pinup
in this field.

33:08.861 --> 33:11.114
It looks badass, man.

33:13.574 --> 33:15.743
Kay Kutta.

33:16.661 --> 33:19.539
Overall, this tattoo's a mess.

33:19.622 --> 33:20.790
We gotta talk about the detail.

33:20.873 --> 33:22.583
There's a lot of shaky lines
in here,

33:22.667 --> 33:24.043
her right hand is wonky as hell.

33:24.127 --> 33:27.213
Her finger gets bigger
at the tip of the finger

33:27.296 --> 33:28.715
than it is at the base
of the finger.

33:28.798 --> 33:29.674
Which finger
are we talking about?

33:29.757 --> 33:31.217
That big-ass
[bleep] weird finger

33:31.300 --> 33:32.260
hanging down there.
Look at that hand.

33:32.343 --> 33:34.429
Which one we talking about,
the right hand?

33:34.512 --> 33:35.263
The one that looks
totally [bleep] up.

33:35.346 --> 33:37.056
{\an5}-Closest to you.

33:35.346 --> 33:37.056
-You don't tell me

33:37.140 --> 33:38.850
that hand don't look [bleep] up?

33:38.933 --> 33:39.934
I can't really see
what you're talking about.

33:40.017 --> 33:41.561
{\an5}-I don't--

33:40.017 --> 33:41.561
-Give me a [bleep] break!

33:41.644 --> 33:42.562
The big one.
The third one.

33:42.645 --> 33:44.063
{\an5}-Look at this hand!

33:42.645 --> 33:44.063
-That's her ring finger.

33:44.147 --> 33:46.441
Her hand is bent like--
her hand is bent like this.

33:46.524 --> 33:47.942
If you don't--if you--
here's the problem, man,

33:48.025 --> 33:50.194
if you look at that hand, and
don't think it looks [bleep]...

33:50.278 --> 33:51.654
{\an5}-I think the outline--

33:50.278 --> 33:51.654
-then that's the problem!

33:51.738 --> 33:53.448
{\an5}-I think the outline is--

33:51.738 --> 33:53.448
-there is our major problem.

33:53.531 --> 33:56.159
I can't say that
that hand is [bleep] up.

33:56.242 --> 33:57.285
The fact that I can say
this hand is jacked,

33:57.368 --> 33:59.704
and you stand here and say,
"I don't think it is,"

33:59.787 --> 34:01.706
you got to start over and learn.

34:01.789 --> 34:03.332
From here on out,
there's no more forgiveness.

34:03.416 --> 34:04.292
These kind of fundamentals
are not gonna

34:04.375 --> 34:06.043
be able to keep you
in this competition.

34:08.713 --> 34:09.755
Head back to the loft.

34:09.839 --> 34:12.007
We'll call you back
when we've made our decision.

34:14.802 --> 34:17.138
They were way more
harsh on me

34:17.221 --> 34:19.681
than they were
on other people.

34:19.766 --> 34:20.975
At the end of the day,
they still hold you

34:21.058 --> 34:22.851
in very high regards.

34:22.935 --> 34:23.895
They didn't like it.

34:23.978 --> 34:26.105
They tore people
the [bleep] up,

34:26.188 --> 34:27.732
and you're mad?

34:27.815 --> 34:29.150
Their job is to pick it apart.

34:29.233 --> 34:29.859
{\an5}-If they say nothing, then--

34:29.233 --> 34:29.859
-But it's not fair!

34:29.942 --> 34:31.860
They pick apart one person's,

34:31.944 --> 34:33.487
and they don't pick apart
another person's

34:33.571 --> 34:35.031
that has
the exact same things in it.

34:35.114 --> 34:38.659
Like, they called me out
on the dark shading on the face,

34:38.743 --> 34:40.119
and they didn't call you out.

34:41.078 --> 34:42.455
{\an5}-What do you mean?

34:41.078 --> 34:42.455
-Yeah.

34:42.538 --> 34:46.042
Your tattoo
was [bleep] too dark.

34:46.125 --> 34:47.918
I just don't think
it's [bleep] fair

34:48.002 --> 34:49.253
the way that
the critiques are.

34:49.337 --> 34:50.838
I [bleep] fought hard
for this.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.507
But-- the same things--

34:52.590 --> 34:55.217
the same darkness
on Tatu Baby's tattoo

34:55.301 --> 34:56.177
is pretty much
on mine,

34:56.260 --> 34:58.846
but they did not
say [bleep] about hers.

34:58.930 --> 35:01.516
Whatever.
Don't cry about it.

35:01.599 --> 35:02.600
What the [bleep]?
