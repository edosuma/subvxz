WEBVTT

00:01.167 --> 00:02.752
I think you have a problem with Peabody.

00:02.836 --> 00:05.171
He's come a long way.
I want to give him the shot.

00:05.255 --> 00:07.257
-Jobs go to who's qualified, man.
-You--

00:08.258 --> 00:10.510
NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:10.593 --> 00:12.429
Ernesto, you got friends out here.

00:12.512 --> 00:14.264
-He want anything specific?
-Safe place.

00:14.347 --> 00:15.598
(gunshots)

00:15.682 --> 00:18.351
It's all right, don't shoot!
All right, it's cool, it's cool!

00:18.435 --> 00:19.269
Damn!

00:20.520 --> 00:21.396
He's finished.

00:21.938 --> 00:24.274
-Who started it?
-They came in to pay back the Blood,

00:24.357 --> 00:27.193
about 20 Diablos in four cars.

00:27.277 --> 00:30.905
Jimmy tells me you might have an interest
in making some other loans.

00:30.989 --> 00:32.365
You might want to put some dough
on the street.

00:32.449 --> 00:34.117
That's a definite possibility.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.827
Franco approached Wachtel

00:35.910 --> 00:38.788
to toss the South Ferry bust
on these video poker games.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.374
Alan had agreed to wear a wire
on these guys.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.460
We had arranged a meeting
for tonight at the Lucky Deuce.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.712
So help me, I think I'm becoming
an excitement junkie.

00:45.795 --> 00:48.548
-What is Apollo?
-Apollo-- Apollo, my horse.

00:49.174 --> 00:52.635
And if the city council doesn't want him,
I do, and I'm gonna keep him!

00:52.719 --> 00:54.345
Mr. Franco says search him.

00:54.429 --> 00:55.889
What are you gonna do?
Search him or kiss him?

00:55.972 --> 00:57.891
Keep the door jamb. Go on, go on!

00:57.974 --> 00:59.893
You're an excitable guy, Mike.

01:00.393 --> 01:03.980
-What do you really want?
-I need for us to be separate.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.940
Then I guess that's what we'll have to do.

01:08.568 --> 01:11.279
-(indistinct chatter)
-LUCY: <i>Okay, people. Shut up!</i>

01:12.781 --> 01:13.990
Item five,

01:14.365 --> 01:17.577
last night, the Diablos and the Bloods
squared off on South Dekker.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.205
We got two dead, five wounded.

01:20.830 --> 01:22.665
Worst single gang incident
in the last five years.

01:22.749 --> 01:25.001
Now, people,
this is gonna get bad, real bad.

01:25.502 --> 01:29.255
But I strongly recommend that if you
patrol on gang turf, you wear that vest.

01:29.339 --> 01:32.258
Now, related arrest warrants
will be posted upstairs, check them out.

01:33.009 --> 01:36.012
Most important being Marcus Peabody
who's now head of the Blood.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.889
-(indistinct chatter)
-(shushing)

01:37.972 --> 01:39.349
And Jesus Martinez.

01:39.682 --> 01:41.059
I'm the one who's getting married.
It's not you.

01:41.142 --> 01:42.977
So you don't even need to worry about it.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.188
-Andy?
-What?

01:45.688 --> 01:47.524
Just let me know when I can go on, okay?

01:47.607 --> 01:49.109
Sarge, I'm sitting here
on the eve of my nuptials,

01:49.192 --> 01:50.860
and two of my groomsmen and my best man

01:50.944 --> 01:52.487
have yet to darken the door
of Sam's Tuxedos--

01:52.570 --> 01:55.448
This is roll call, Officer Renko.

01:56.366 --> 01:57.200
Thank you very much.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.202
Try to treat people like adults,
look what they do to you.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.620
-Look what they've done--
-Item six,

02:00.703 --> 02:03.164
Mick Belker's operation straight flush.

02:03.790 --> 02:07.418
Now, this is the try at taking down
the illustrious Lester Franco.

02:07.877 --> 02:11.214
It looks like it's turned into
a loan-sharking undercover.

02:11.631 --> 02:14.551
And note,
Mick says no cops will get paper.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.177
(laughter)

02:16.261 --> 02:18.972
Patrols, he's working out of
the Lucky Deuce on Arnold Street.

02:19.514 --> 02:20.348
Last item.

02:21.766 --> 02:23.226
What you probably already know,

02:23.560 --> 02:27.063
today begins what we hope
will be a long and prosperous run

02:27.147 --> 02:30.191
for Lieutenant Calletano
on the game show <i>Lucky Ducks.</i>

02:30.275 --> 02:32.902
(quacking)

02:34.320 --> 02:37.615
Which reminds me
of one of only three jokes that I know--

02:37.699 --> 02:39.075
-MAN: Hey, don't tell it!
-Yeah.

02:39.784 --> 02:44.330
Which is a fat guy goes into a bar
with a duck on his head.

02:44.414 --> 02:47.125
Bartender says,
"Hey, where'd you get the pig?"

02:47.625 --> 02:49.586
Guys says, "It's not a pig, it's a duck."

02:50.336 --> 02:53.006
Bartender says,
"I was talking to the duck."

02:53.590 --> 02:56.050
(groaning and quacking)

02:56.134 --> 02:57.302
Yucka, yucka, yucka.

02:57.385 --> 03:00.221
Okay, let's roll.
Let's be careful out there.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.724
(indistinct chatter)

03:02.807 --> 03:06.769
All right, those who wish to remain
in Andrew Renko's wedding party,

03:06.853 --> 03:10.607
at 9:30 a.m. this morning,
barring unforeseeable accident,

03:10.690 --> 03:13.735
please show up at Sam Waterloo's Tuxedos.

03:18.740 --> 03:21.701
Good morning, Howard.
How are you this fine day?

03:21.784 --> 03:24.120
-I'm fair, Ray.
-Just fair?

03:24.204 --> 03:27.790
It seems that my Apollo
has come down with a bit of a sniffle.

03:27.874 --> 03:30.043
I am sure he'll be just fine, though.

03:30.126 --> 03:31.336
Uh, well, he's at the vet.

03:31.419 --> 03:33.546
Now, you know,
a good horse takes sickness hard.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.132
He'll come back quick,
but he takes it hard.

03:36.382 --> 03:39.052
That's wonderful, Howard.
I am so happy for you.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.057
Are you doing that game show today?

03:44.140 --> 03:47.518
The coordinator told me,
"Start when you open your eyes.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.354
Cheerful, enthusiastic.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.815
Embrace the day with open arms."

03:53.107 --> 03:56.361
And this,
<i>A Hundred and One Thousand Facts.</i>

03:56.653 --> 03:59.405
<i>Lucky Ducks</i> takes its questions from it.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.326
Do you know who founded
the United States Coast Guard, Howard?

04:03.409 --> 04:05.745
Yes, yes, Alexander Hamilton.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.582
Lucy. Oh, Lucy, please.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.752
Why can't you ask yourself
these questions?

04:12.835 --> 04:14.796
I'd cheat. Now, please.

04:15.505 --> 04:16.965
-Just one.
-A hard one.

04:19.759 --> 04:20.593
Okay.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.887
"During the siege of Calais in 1346,

04:22.971 --> 04:27.392
in what township was David II of Scotland
defeated and taken prisoner?"

04:31.020 --> 04:33.606
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:33.940 --> 04:35.733
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:35.817 --> 04:39.612
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:39.696 --> 04:41.364
(sirens wailing)

04:46.786 --> 04:50.540
(theme music playing)

06:11.996 --> 06:13.998
-Here you go, man.
-Oh, thanks, man.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.920
Heedlock? Tony Heedlock.

06:19.003 --> 06:20.755
What the hell kind of name is Heedlock?

06:21.130 --> 06:23.132
This is it?
This is the description they got?

06:23.216 --> 06:25.426
The call just said he picks up
the racing form here every morning.

06:25.510 --> 06:28.971
But the tip came in for Finnegan, man.
Night shift can't make its own busts?

06:29.055 --> 06:31.724
Hey, Finnegan's wife went into labor
last night, man.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.559
Hey, why don't you
gripe some more, huh, babe, huh?

06:33.643 --> 06:35.436
-Come on.
-Hey, this guy fits.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.068
Tony? Tony Heedlock?

06:42.985 --> 06:44.112
Hey, wait a second, man.

06:44.529 --> 06:48.074
-We just want to talk to you, Tony.
-Hey, hold up! Police!

06:48.991 --> 06:50.118
Move it!

06:50.201 --> 06:52.036
Slow down, man! Slow down!

06:53.413 --> 06:55.957
Police! Freeze it! Hit the wall!

06:56.499 --> 06:58.042
-Let's move it!
-I didn't do anything!

06:58.126 --> 06:59.752
What are you running for?
Come on, up against it.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.504
I thought you guys were gonna rob me!

07:01.838 --> 07:03.339
I swear, I didn't do anything!

07:03.423 --> 07:05.633
You ain't got nothing
to worry about, right, Tony?

07:06.968 --> 07:08.302
-Let's go, man.
-Let's move it.

07:09.595 --> 07:13.433
Captain, we just picked up Marcus Peabody.
ETA's five minutes.

07:13.516 --> 07:16.060
-You have the raw files on last night?
-My Diablo party?

07:19.689 --> 07:21.607
Four sightings of Marcus
leading the Blood.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.277
-Nobody ID'ed Jesus.
-Anything to incriminate Peabody?

07:24.819 --> 07:27.196
You should've been at the Lucky Deuce
last night, Frank.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.284
Yeah, I hear things were a little hairy.

07:33.035 --> 07:35.997
I don't know if you're punning,
but I can tell you in a serious vein,

07:36.080 --> 07:37.790
thank God for Michael Belker.

07:38.791 --> 07:42.253
Uh, did you run the particulars for Ray?
He's coordinating. Ray.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.755
Franco's goon paid me half the bribe.

07:44.839 --> 07:48.301
I get the other half when I rule on
that liquor authority bust this morning.

07:48.759 --> 07:52.013
-The straight flush undercover.
-We got Lester Franco

07:52.096 --> 07:55.475
by the proverbials, Lieutenant,
whole transaction on tape.

07:56.100 --> 07:59.604
-You've done a heck of a job, Alan.
-So, when do we spring the trap, Frank?

07:59.687 --> 08:02.482
When do we close our jaws
and grind these vermin to pulp?

08:03.357 --> 08:04.275
Bernstein will keep you posted--

08:04.358 --> 08:06.903
-I really have to--
-Captain, Peabody.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.744
You got charges, Furillo?

08:16.370 --> 08:17.497
I have a promise.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.833
Your gang did crimes last night.
We're gonna put those people away.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.836
That's your thing, ain't it?
Busting who gets attacked.

08:24.212 --> 08:26.088
And yours is seeing yourself as a victim.

08:26.172 --> 08:29.425
We know the Diablos moved on the Blood.
That doesn't give you license to kill.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.594
Look, don't tell me my rights, Furillo.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.555
I stopped playing by your rules yesterday.

08:35.431 --> 08:37.934
Your sad story interests me
not at all, Marcus.

08:38.267 --> 08:39.644
Yesterday,
you may have been trying to help.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.020
Today, you're part of the problem.

08:41.437 --> 08:42.396
This is notice.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.774
I want a truce, and I'm gonna
squeeze you hard till I get it

08:44.857 --> 08:45.942
or till I get you out.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.778
Is that a fact?

08:49.320 --> 08:51.030
Yeah, well, don't squeeze too hard.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.324
That's it. Make the mistake.

09:11.759 --> 09:12.927
Let's deliver, Henry.

09:13.344 --> 09:14.428
Blood gets no rhythm.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.556
Every bust sticks, no matter how low-rent.

09:19.058 --> 09:22.144
-So do we go hard on the Diablos, too?
-Not till we talk to Jesus.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.563
He may have heard things by then.

09:24.355 --> 09:25.982
-Hi.
-Hi.

09:31.445 --> 09:33.239
I was trying to sell my mother's old car.

09:33.322 --> 09:35.741
And this guy who got hurt, Phil,

09:35.825 --> 09:37.868
he kept saying the transmission was shot.

09:38.869 --> 09:41.455
He didn't get hurt, Mr. Heedlock.
He's in a coma.

09:42.498 --> 09:44.000
Now, the two of you left the bar together?

09:44.417 --> 09:46.794
Yeah, he kept saying
he wanted to test drive it again,

09:47.003 --> 09:50.965
so we drove it around a little while,
and then he asked me to let him off.

09:51.507 --> 09:54.176
Then sayonara, the next thing
I know, I'm under arrest.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.846
Is this rap sheet correct?
You've never been arrested?

09:56.929 --> 09:57.930
Absolutely.

09:58.639 --> 10:03.102
I mean, come on, they bring me in here
for robbery and attempted homicide,

10:03.185 --> 10:05.605
and my mom will tell you,
I don't even swat flies.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.191
Now, do you think we can get to court
before lunch?

10:09.525 --> 10:10.860
Why is that, Mr. Heedlock?

10:10.943 --> 10:13.321
I have a job appointment.
I'm my mama's sole support.

10:14.030 --> 10:17.325
Mr. Heedlock, I'm your advocate.
Spare me the job appointments, all right?

10:17.825 --> 10:19.702
You've got an out-of-state record,
don't you?

10:20.995 --> 10:22.204
What are you talking about?

10:22.622 --> 10:24.749
Your rap sheet didn't pick up
the out-of-states.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.752
You're angling for a fast arraignment
before the BCI check

10:27.835 --> 10:30.546
shows you've been a bad boy
in a few jurisdictions.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.464
(chuckles)

10:33.341 --> 10:36.135
Look, my mama's gonna meet us
at court with some references,

10:36.218 --> 10:37.553
so can we hurry up?

10:38.763 --> 10:39.805
Give me your statement.

10:47.396 --> 10:49.148
Well, what do you all think?

10:49.523 --> 10:52.068
-I don't know, Andy.
-Kind of bluish.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.819
Funny, it doesn't look bluish.

10:54.278 --> 10:56.989
Renko, do you think her dad
is really gonna fit in this.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.241
Well, he's almost the same
size as you are, Rudy.

10:59.617 --> 11:02.536
-No kidding?
-Say, how's this color for girth?

11:02.828 --> 11:04.747
You said you wanted a pastel.
Thank you very much.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.165
She said it, not me.

11:06.957 --> 11:07.792
Fantastic.

11:10.002 --> 11:12.505
-Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.
-BOBBY: It'll be fine, Andy.

11:12.588 --> 11:14.674
I don't know if these look
so good, you know.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.467
These cuffs are--

11:17.426 --> 11:19.929
Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, you crazy, man?

11:20.012 --> 11:21.972
Sorry, son, instructions
from the credit card company.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.933
-Take off the suits.
-We got a gig in an hour!

11:24.016 --> 11:25.267
My cousin's getting married!

11:25.351 --> 11:27.436
-You're gonna blow the whole thing!
-That's not my problem!

11:27.520 --> 11:29.188
Now, come on, take off the monkey suits.

11:29.271 --> 11:30.648
We don't want to make
a federal case out of this.

11:30.731 --> 11:33.359
They are going to be 400 people there!
What are they gonna do for music?

11:33.442 --> 11:34.944
The suits come off now!

11:35.027 --> 11:38.531
-What is going on here, Sam?
-Guy's plastic's no good,

11:38.614 --> 11:39.699
and they're making a federal case.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.492
Why don't you mind
your own business, pork lips?

11:41.575 --> 11:43.202
-Yeah!
-Let me tell you something.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.788
That man just asked you
to get out of those tuxedos.

11:46.455 --> 11:48.499
What, you want us
to get out of these tuxedos?

11:49.542 --> 11:50.793
-(fabric rips)
-There!

11:50.876 --> 11:52.878
-Don't rip! Don't rip!
-There!

11:52.962 --> 11:54.755
(laughing)

11:55.256 --> 11:57.049
That is real funny, there, boy.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.300
But I'll tell you what's funnier.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.677
You look right here at all my friends,

11:59.760 --> 12:01.387
they're all policemen,
and you're under arrest.

12:01.470 --> 12:02.847
(shouting)

12:04.140 --> 12:05.224
Hey, careful! Watch it!

12:06.809 --> 12:08.978
Easy! Easy! That's merchandise!

12:09.061 --> 12:10.312
Don't trash the store, huh?

12:11.188 --> 12:12.148
That's enough!

12:12.231 --> 12:13.816
Look at this mess!
Who's gonna pay for this?

12:15.192 --> 12:18.070
(police radio chatter)

12:18.487 --> 12:20.906
-2203 responding.
-Hands behind your back.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.616
Hey, Joe, we got a disturbance call.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.160
Stay put, now.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.496
-All right, it's your collar, guys.
-All right. Get my cuffs.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.000
Oh, Lordy!
Look what this little mutant's done

12:31.083 --> 12:32.710
to my brand-new wedding suit!

12:41.969 --> 12:43.304
MICK: Something I can help you with?

12:44.388 --> 12:45.681
Yeah, I'm looking to borrow some money.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.684
-I'm looking for Lester Franco.
-You can talk to me.

12:49.852 --> 12:53.856
-Franco let you make loans?
-That depends how much and for what.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.608
Joey, what do you say?

12:55.691 --> 12:58.027
Hey, Mr. Franco. Somebody here to see you.

12:58.527 --> 13:00.738
-Somebody who?
-Marcus Peabody.

13:00.821 --> 13:03.032
So, what can I do for you, Marcus Peabody?

13:03.324 --> 13:04.658
I need 25 grand.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.911
Same arrangement you gave Lewis Joyce.

13:06.994 --> 13:08.996
-MAN: What's good, Joey?
-LESTER: You know Lewis?

13:09.079 --> 13:10.206
MARCUS: He's my half-brother.

13:10.498 --> 13:11.499
LESTER: Sit down here.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.878
Can I get you something
from the bar, Marcus?

13:16.420 --> 13:18.339
-NG, Mike.
-What?

13:18.422 --> 13:21.258
I told you, anything controversial,
refer it back to Lester.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.468
What's controversial?

13:23.385 --> 13:25.262
A smoke in gang colors? Come on.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.014
LESTER: And the purpose of this loan,

13:27.473 --> 13:28.891
would this be in the same area that Lewis

13:28.974 --> 13:30.226
-was involved with?
-Right.

13:30.309 --> 13:33.395
Of course, a loan like this, Marcus,
we get 50 points a week,

13:33.479 --> 13:35.606
plus a certain amount of supervision,

13:35.689 --> 13:38.734
plus a certain amount of product control
until the money's satisfied.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.319
So, when do I get the money?

13:40.402 --> 13:42.696
Hey, hey, take it easy, here.
(speaks Italian)

13:43.239 --> 13:45.491
Give us a chance to do
a little credit work on you.

13:46.075 --> 13:50.579
Uh, now, Lewis, he's away, ain't he?
He's in the joint?

13:50.663 --> 13:52.623
He gets calls between 11:00 and 11:30.

13:54.124 --> 13:58.003
So we'll give him a call.
Ask around in a few places.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.922
-Ask about what?
-About you.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.675
Hey, don't worry. We don't care
if you're late paying your phone bill.

14:02.758 --> 14:05.010
Let me tell you what you
want to know, man, all right.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.596
I got a war. I'm gonna move
some stuff to pay for it.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.265
You get 50 points a week.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.267
LESTER: Hey, Marcus,
don't get excited over here.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.686
You're asking us
to come up with a big number.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.771
Give us a few hours to look into you.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.315
Come on, come on. Be optimistic.

14:18.399 --> 14:22.236
You know, it don't do me no good
keeping my money in my pockets.

14:22.319 --> 14:23.696
Come on. I'll walk you out.

14:25.990 --> 14:29.535
-So, I'll hear from you today?
-Absolutely. Take in a movie or something.

14:36.041 --> 14:39.044
-What is it with this guy?
-I was just telling him, Mr. F.

14:39.128 --> 14:41.630
-It was my mistake.
-The <i>mulignans,</i> Mike,

14:41.714 --> 14:43.966
you're probably better off leaving to me,

14:44.049 --> 14:45.926
especially when it comes to pushing dope.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.053
You're gonna make him the loan?

14:49.346 --> 14:50.764
We'll see how he checks out.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.309
I love this little guy.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.186
Always looking to get in trouble.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.480
Come on, Mike. I'll buy you a beer.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.746
(tires screech)

15:16.290 --> 15:18.250
-There he is. Bust him.
-What's he doing?

15:18.542 --> 15:20.669
He's getting rich.
People are lining up, bringing him stuff.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.588
Eggshells, razors, bugs.

15:22.671 --> 15:24.340
My clientele don't like crowds.

15:25.382 --> 15:27.593
-RUDY: What's he doing with the car?
-What's it look like?

15:28.928 --> 15:32.264
-Hang on to this.
-I said 20 bucks for the whole interior.

15:32.348 --> 15:34.475
Hey, I got scruples.
I don't eat nothing religious.

15:34.558 --> 15:37.269
-Sir, is this your car?
-He towed it here.

15:39.396 --> 15:42.024
It's a junker. I use it to get attention.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.068
RUDY: This car belong to anybody here?

15:46.195 --> 15:48.280
All right, sir,
you're gonna have to come with us.

15:49.073 --> 15:51.158
-I'm just getting started.
-No, you're just getting arrested.

15:51.241 --> 15:53.786
-What's the charge?
-Public nuisance, okay?

15:53.869 --> 15:55.329
And if you don't come along,
it's resisting, too.

15:55.412 --> 15:56.664
Aw, come on!

15:57.122 --> 15:57.957
Hey!

16:00.125 --> 16:02.169
It's a crime to have talent? Huh?

16:02.252 --> 16:03.921
People come to me
with their sadistic impulses.

16:04.004 --> 16:07.466
I turn that impulse around, that's all!
I'm an artist! I am an artist!

16:07.549 --> 16:08.384
Put your hands up.

16:10.344 --> 16:11.887
-What happened to your finger?
-Huh? Oh, I, uh--

16:11.971 --> 16:12.930
Hey, don't ask.

16:14.306 --> 16:15.933
He likes carrots, Doctor.

16:16.016 --> 16:17.810
If anything will get him
on his feet it's...

16:19.311 --> 16:20.854
You know, I was just remembering, uh,

16:20.938 --> 16:22.356
of course,
this is without scientific basis,

16:22.439 --> 16:24.775
but we used to use warm water and clove.

16:26.694 --> 16:29.613
Well, it's bad when a horse
lies down like this, isn't it, Doctor?

16:30.656 --> 16:34.326
No, no, you won't see any flagging of hope
from this quarter, sir,

16:34.410 --> 16:37.287
and you do know that I'm more than willing
to come to the stable.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.581
Thank you. You do have the number?

16:40.082 --> 16:42.334
-MAN: What's the biggest thing?
-Thank you, Doctor.

16:42.584 --> 16:44.878
(indistinct chatter)

16:47.089 --> 16:48.424
You ever eat a firecracker?

16:48.632 --> 16:52.261
Come on. Dynamite, fulminate
of mercury, nitroglycerin.

16:52.594 --> 16:54.847
Where's my pen? Where's my retractable?

16:54.930 --> 16:56.557
Maybe you want to be his manager,
Rudy, huh?

16:56.640 --> 17:01.353
You, if you think eating my pen
is gonna get you outta here, you're wrong!

17:04.398 --> 17:05.232
(grunting)

17:06.275 --> 17:07.568
-What's the matter?
-What are you doing?

17:12.948 --> 17:15.325
I was fooling around. I was bored.

17:15.659 --> 17:17.036
This is a felt tip.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.871
-(thud)
-(shouting)

17:18.954 --> 17:21.707
You come into my place like that again,
I'm gonna tear you up!

17:21.790 --> 17:24.752
-Sounds like a threat.
-A stone guarantee.

17:24.835 --> 17:26.128
Easy, Jesus.

17:27.129 --> 17:30.007
They came into the place without warrants.
Their pieces were out.

17:30.549 --> 17:31.550
That's great, Jesus.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.761
When did you become
such a constitutional lawyer?

17:33.844 --> 17:35.304
My kid and wife were there.

17:39.433 --> 17:40.267
Thanks, Lucy.

17:41.143 --> 17:44.063
You best call your people off, Furillo.
I ain't lying!

17:44.146 --> 17:46.732
The Diablos
were in a pitched battle last night,

17:46.815 --> 17:49.151
-and I want some answers from you.
-JESUS: Anyone see me there?

17:49.777 --> 17:51.570
Am I overestimating you, Jesus?

17:51.653 --> 17:54.281
Diablos go for a payback
without you in front?

17:54.364 --> 17:56.658
I was in a motel on the parkway.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.077
I got a photo of me and the clerk

17:58.160 --> 18:01.080
in front of a television
at the 11:00 news.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.832
Sort of suggests you knew
trouble was coming, Jesus.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.460
What? Is that a crime now?

18:07.169 --> 18:10.255
-I don't buy that you're out as leader.
-Buy it, Furillo.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.258
I walked out
of the war council last night.

18:13.342 --> 18:16.011
-I laid down my colors.
-What would it take to get you back?

18:17.096 --> 18:18.514
You ain't got it, bro.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.433
I need someone to standoff with Marcus.

18:21.892 --> 18:26.105
-I need a leader to speak for a truce.
-I can't do it, not even if I wanted to.

18:26.647 --> 18:29.691
Diablos won't take peace
as long as Peabody's breathing.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.193
They would if you led them to it.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.320
You want me back?!

18:34.321 --> 18:37.699
I gotta kill a Blood in his colors.
Are you willing to pay the price?!

18:40.119 --> 18:41.787
I'll save you the problem, Furillo.

18:42.538 --> 18:43.956
I ain't willing.

18:44.706 --> 18:47.626
I got a wife and a Joselito.
Life goes on, bro.

18:50.504 --> 18:51.338
We're through.

18:52.256 --> 18:56.552
I hope your alibi stands up
'cause we're gonna solve these shootings.

19:00.097 --> 19:02.891
I'll get you a photo
as soon as the roll is developed.

19:03.642 --> 19:04.810
Listen, Frankie.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.396
My sympathies for your situation.

19:09.022 --> 19:10.858
My sympathies for what's coming.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.365
FRANK: Okay, Henry.
Rouse the Diablos, too.

19:23.328 --> 19:26.874
He's right.
It'll be like '78, all-out war.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.585
Would you excuse us a minute, Henry?

19:30.711 --> 19:31.545
Sure.

19:40.762 --> 19:41.597
How are you?

19:42.472 --> 19:44.183
Okay. How are you?

19:46.935 --> 19:50.522
-Where'd you sleep?
-The Warrick.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.357
Did we ever have 308?

19:52.441 --> 19:53.984
(laughs)

19:54.985 --> 19:57.529
I don't know. I don't remember.

20:01.491 --> 20:04.161
I feel so totally strange, Frank. I...

20:05.537 --> 20:06.955
I want to see you so much.

20:08.081 --> 20:10.250
Can we have dinner? Is that all right?

20:10.542 --> 20:11.376
Sure.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.130
I love you, Frank.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.343
I love you.

20:21.762 --> 20:24.389
I'll check later,
see how your time's going.

20:32.105 --> 20:33.565
-Ms. Davenport.
-Yes.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.984
We've got the mother
of Tony Heedlock out here.

20:36.318 --> 20:37.152
Thank you.

20:46.536 --> 20:48.872
Captain, I think I can help you
with this gang thing.

20:49.373 --> 20:51.959
-How?
-Marcus Peabody comes in an hour ago

20:52.042 --> 20:54.294
and asks Franco to bankroll a drug deal.

20:54.378 --> 20:56.046
They're meeting in a little while
to do the loan.

20:56.129 --> 20:58.298
If you want to send some guys over there,
we can take them both.

20:58.382 --> 21:01.343
-Is there any way to access the drugs?
-Might be possible.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.345
Franco wants one of his people
babysitting.

21:03.845 --> 21:05.681
I'd really like to take Peabody holding.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.183
Okay, let's follow
this one a little further.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.101
Yes, sir.

21:09.893 --> 21:11.979
-Frequent contact, Mick.
-Yes, sir.

21:18.652 --> 21:19.486
Henry.

21:21.571 --> 21:23.031
(door closes)

21:23.115 --> 21:24.950
Mick thinks he may have a way to Peabody.

21:25.993 --> 21:28.745
-Sure not gonna bust him for last night.
-(water running)

21:33.250 --> 21:34.459
Let me get way out of line.

21:35.919 --> 21:37.629
Everything okay between you and Joyce?

21:41.425 --> 21:42.759
We separated last night.

21:44.511 --> 21:45.345
Ooh.

21:46.930 --> 21:49.016
-I'm sorry.
-Is it that obvious?

21:50.934 --> 21:54.062
I don't know. I just recognized the look
from when Rachel and I split up.

21:55.856 --> 21:58.233
-Let's hope it's only for a few weeks.
-Oh, yeah.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.110
I'm sure you'll get back together again.

22:02.279 --> 22:05.198
Anyway, any time you'd like to talk...

22:07.034 --> 22:07.868
Thanks, Henry.

22:17.127 --> 22:19.838
I thought we were going to meet
at the courthouse, Mrs. Heedlock.

22:19.921 --> 22:21.757
Tony thought this might save time.

22:22.674 --> 22:26.553
I brought his last pay stub,
statement of an alibi witness,

22:26.636 --> 22:29.723
his rental lease with his name on it,
here's statements of neighbors.

22:30.223 --> 22:31.767
Tony's a saint in our building.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.226
I'm sure he is.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.604
Here's the number
of the probation department.

22:35.687 --> 22:37.189
They make out the bail report.

22:37.272 --> 22:39.483
Yeah, I already dropped copies with them.

22:40.025 --> 22:42.110
Got to have Tony out, you know?

22:42.194 --> 22:44.613
-He's my sole support.
-He told me.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.698
You're going to get him into court
before lunch, then?

22:49.034 --> 22:51.495
Did Tony tell you why that was important,
Mrs. Heedlock?

22:52.704 --> 22:55.082
He's trying to end run
some out-of-state warrants.

22:55.165 --> 22:58.710
He told me it was for the job interview,
and I believe him.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.674
Oh, excuse me, Ms. Davenport.

23:04.925 --> 23:07.260
It's all right, Lieutenant.
Good luck today.

23:07.844 --> 23:10.180
Thank you. I think I'm gonna need it.

23:14.142 --> 23:16.353
(sirens wailing)

23:18.355 --> 23:19.731
(tires screeching)

23:23.485 --> 23:25.654
Hey, mister...
that's gonna get you some days, pal.

23:25.737 --> 23:28.115
For blowing gauge, man.
You're outta your mind!

23:28.198 --> 23:29.741
Yeah? Concealed weapon, huh?

23:29.825 --> 23:32.994
-Nay, man. I do computer repairs!
-Sell the business.

23:33.328 --> 23:36.123
HOWARD (on megaphone):
Do not attempt to run or resist arrest.

23:36.623 --> 23:41.878
All those not being detained
will please clear the area.

23:42.462 --> 23:46.550
All those being detained,
take note of this date.

23:46.633 --> 23:50.220
Those that can write,
inscribe it on your calendar.

23:50.971 --> 23:53.306
As of today, you will not wear colors

23:53.390 --> 23:56.518
and drop gum wrappers in the street.

23:57.018 --> 24:00.605
You will not wear them
and play loud music.

24:00.689 --> 24:02.524
Who you think you're hassling, sucker?

24:03.066 --> 24:04.901
Isn't it pretty clear who we're hassling?

24:06.069 --> 24:07.946
We're hassling you!

24:08.029 --> 24:09.531
(indistinct chattering)

24:09.614 --> 24:11.074
Mikey...

24:12.200 --> 24:13.034
What's doin'?

24:13.368 --> 24:14.619
-Coffee?
-No.

24:15.787 --> 24:17.247
(sniffs, groans)

24:17.330 --> 24:18.415
Jeez, Mike.

24:18.498 --> 24:21.042
This guy Marcus came up
40 different kinds of trouble.

24:21.668 --> 24:24.254
-He's not getting the loan?
-Well, in the past 24 hours,

24:24.337 --> 24:26.047
he gets fired from his city job,

24:26.131 --> 24:28.633
croaks some PR who's holding him hostage.

24:28.717 --> 24:30.302
And he's involved in a gang war.

24:30.886 --> 24:33.180
JIMMY:
He's really on a roll, your friend Marcus.

24:33.263 --> 24:38.185
Hey, he wants to move drugs.
He's not gonna be "citizen of the year."

24:38.435 --> 24:40.187
-(bangs table)
-Hey, now let's keep it

24:40.270 --> 24:41.480
friendly here, Marcus.

24:41.563 --> 24:43.982
-Let's stay smart.
-Man, how you gonna be smart, man?

24:44.065 --> 24:45.901
-I come to you--
-No question about that.

24:45.984 --> 24:47.152
The problem is you're hot.

24:47.235 --> 24:48.737
I got a war to finance!

24:49.905 --> 24:52.741
-You want a 100 points? 150?
-The vig don't make no difference.

24:52.824 --> 24:54.659
I'm trying to make some sense to you here.

24:54.743 --> 24:57.496
Look, either I move soda
or I take it off of somebody else.

24:57.579 --> 24:59.664
-I know who you bankroll.
-You see, now you're making threats.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.666
You got that right, man! I'll take you on!

25:01.750 --> 25:05.337
Calm down. Calm down.
No, Jimmy, no, no! Joey!

25:08.632 --> 25:11.593
Just let go of me right now,
and we'll talk some business.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.011
Let go of me.

25:18.850 --> 25:20.435
You're this serious about this?

25:20.519 --> 25:22.687
You're willing to spend
150 points for this?

25:22.771 --> 25:23.980
That's what I said.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.276
Give me about an hour
to come up with the dough.

25:32.030 --> 25:33.114
You know where this is?

25:39.246 --> 25:40.413
I didn't mean to get evil.

25:41.498 --> 25:42.958
-I got a temper.
-It's all right.

25:43.833 --> 25:46.336
This is serious. It's important to you.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.673
I'll see you in an hour, Marcus.

25:56.471 --> 25:57.430
(laughs)

25:58.265 --> 26:02.477
If you want to piece some of that out,
Mr. F., 150 points sounds very good to me.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.479
We're finished for
the day here, Mike, all right?

26:04.563 --> 26:06.356
-See you tomorrow.
-Yeah, I--

26:06.439 --> 26:09.401
Stop giving me this conversation
all the time, all right, Mike?

26:09.484 --> 26:10.610
-Yeah.
-Forget the loan.

26:11.528 --> 26:13.446
Just clean this up here. Come on.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.034
JIMMY: You're not gonna go
in business with him?

26:25.709 --> 26:27.252
All right, come on, Joycie.
What's the score?

26:27.335 --> 26:30.255
-Are we dealing with a scum wad here?
-Read the probation report, Your Honor.

26:31.548 --> 26:32.382
(sighs)

26:32.924 --> 26:37.596
All right, lease, references,
mother sole support...

26:38.930 --> 26:41.850
-No priors. Weak case?
-So-so.

26:42.434 --> 26:45.103
Just happened, Judge.
We're still working on it.

26:45.186 --> 26:46.146
Victim's in a coma.

26:46.521 --> 26:48.273
I wouldn't say this guy's a saint.

26:48.481 --> 26:51.443
-You're assuming he's guilty.
-What bail can he make, Joyce?

26:52.068 --> 26:53.653
My client's informed me he's indigent.

26:53.737 --> 26:55.864
If he could get out,
his former employer's here.

26:55.947 --> 27:02.287
Uh, Judge, I would just like to say
the accused was one of my best employees.

27:02.370 --> 27:05.373
You can have a job with me
whenever you get out, Mr. Heedlock.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.416
Sorry, Judge.

27:10.337 --> 27:11.171
Heartwarming.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.548
Okay, step back.

27:16.468 --> 27:17.302
Mr. Heedlock.

27:18.261 --> 27:19.095
(clears throat)

27:20.096 --> 27:21.056
I commend you.

27:22.057 --> 27:24.476
Your mother made a fine impression
on the probation department.

27:24.559 --> 27:25.602
You got a clean record.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.897
And for these reasons,
I'm setting a bargain-basement bail.

27:29.731 --> 27:32.359
$12,000, $1,200, cash alternative.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.403
I told you my client was indigent.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.321
JUDGE: Of course.

27:37.155 --> 27:40.659
Well, then, he'll stay in the pokey where
an attempted homicide suspect belongs!

27:41.910 --> 27:45.246
But please know, Mr. Heedlock,
how impressed I was.

27:45.330 --> 27:46.581
-(bangs gavel)
-Next case.

27:52.295 --> 27:55.757
-I keep thinking of the Mad Hatter.
-Excuse me, Ms. Davenport?

27:56.591 --> 27:59.135
Uh, nothing, Your Honor. Off the record.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.806
-Where do I pay bail?
-The indigent mother?

28:02.889 --> 28:03.807
Buzz off.

28:04.891 --> 28:06.518
JUDGE: Will counsel approach?

28:07.102 --> 28:08.770
MAN: Down the hall, make a left.

28:09.145 --> 28:11.648
Hey, Neal, I've got Heedlock's FBI sheet.

28:11.731 --> 28:13.900
Man, the guy's run bunco in six states.

28:14.150 --> 28:16.778
He's got two assaults
and armed robbery for good measure.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.571
-Too late, man.
-Gentlemen.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.116
Hey, Heedlock, nice.

28:22.283 --> 28:25.412
Tony Northrop in Georgia.
Tony Grumman in Florida.

28:25.495 --> 28:27.706
Tony McDonnell. Tony Douglas.

28:28.289 --> 28:30.792
-What's "Heedlock"?
-Oh, "Lockheed" turned around.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.545
-(elevator door opens)
-What can I say? I like airplanes.

28:33.628 --> 28:35.797
You better show up for your day in court,
man, or we're coming to get you.

28:41.928 --> 28:42.804
Uh, excuse me.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.683
-Heedlock, that was your case, right?
-Sure. Why?

28:47.016 --> 28:49.352
Well, I'm just wondering,
you see, I'm a law student.

28:50.061 --> 28:51.730
Did you know he had all these priors?

28:52.522 --> 28:54.524
Have you studied
attorney-client privilege yet?

28:54.607 --> 28:59.529
Yeah, but I'm just saying, knowing that,
as a lawyer, doesn't it make you sick?

29:00.447 --> 29:02.866
I can't afford to be sick
all the time, Detective.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.622
I am a little nervous. Can you tell?

29:09.706 --> 29:13.001
Nothing to worry about.
Everybody gets a little nervous.

29:13.084 --> 29:15.420
-Everybody? Really?
-Why, of course.

29:15.503 --> 29:18.047
-And most of them do just fine?
-(knock on door)

29:18.131 --> 29:20.842
-I am just a little concerned.
-MAN: Need you on stage in five minutes.

29:20.925 --> 29:22.218
I have an uncertain stomach.

29:22.302 --> 29:24.721
Very few people actually barf.

29:26.264 --> 29:28.725
MAN: <i>Let's have a hand</i>
<i>for our next contestant...</i>

29:29.017 --> 29:30.894

29:30.977 --> 29:32.937
BOBBY: Hush up, you guys.
He looks nervous.

29:33.021 --> 29:34.731
NEAL: Looks kind of skinny on TV.

29:34.814 --> 29:37.984

29:43.823 --> 29:44.657
<i>Yes.</i>

29:44.908 --> 29:48.036

29:48.119 --> 29:49.537

29:50.205 --> 29:51.623
-Come on, Lieutenant!
-All right!

29:54.417 --> 29:56.795
-How many ducks has he got to get?
-Just one duck per question.

29:56.878 --> 29:59.881
-You know, if he answers it--
-He's got to just keep shooting ducks?

29:59.964 --> 30:01.299
-(indistinct chatter)
-(gunshot)

30:01.382 --> 30:02.926
He got it! He got it!

30:09.349 --> 30:14.354

30:15.146 --> 30:17.065
(music plays)

30:20.610 --> 30:22.570
<i>Was it Thomas Jefferson?</i>

30:22.654 --> 30:24.072
<i>Thomas Jefferson is right!</i>

30:24.155 --> 30:25.657
(cheering)

30:26.574 --> 30:29.327
<i>...rotate these ducks</i>

30:32.622 --> 30:35.041
Hey, all right, all right, all right!

30:35.124 --> 30:36.417
Looks like he copped a groove, huh?

30:36.501 --> 30:38.419
Stay as close as you can, Mick.

30:38.753 --> 30:39.838
Yeah, keep me posted.

30:41.339 --> 30:42.757
Thanks a lot, mister.

30:43.132 --> 30:44.050
For what?

30:44.133 --> 30:46.094
The message you left on my machine.

30:46.177 --> 30:49.347
Amazing as it may seem to you, Frank,
I have a social life, too.

30:49.639 --> 30:51.850
When you and Joyce cancel plans
to take Frank Jr. for the weekend--

30:51.933 --> 30:54.352
-We've separated, Fay.
-Who has?

30:55.061 --> 30:55.895
Joyce and I.

31:05.363 --> 31:06.239
Oh, boy.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.286
She said she needs time
to sort things out.

31:12.996 --> 31:14.664
Says it'll only be a couple of weeks.

31:18.668 --> 31:19.878
I don't know what happened.

31:27.343 --> 31:28.761
Oh. (sighs)

31:29.804 --> 31:33.558
I-I wish I could think
of some awful cliché

31:33.641 --> 31:35.310
that would somehow be comforting.

31:35.810 --> 31:36.644
It's all right.

No, that makes no sense!

-As if the others did.
-(both laughing)

31:52.994 --> 31:54.245
"He who laughs last..."

31:56.414 --> 31:57.707

I give that bum every nickel, he loves me.

33:39.183 --> 33:40.977
He ran off with that whore!

33:41.060 --> 33:43.312
His former employer. Gloria.

33:43.396 --> 33:46.649
She's in on it, too. Big, wonderful Gloria

I want his butt in the slam.

34:09.172 --> 34:11.049

34:11.674 --> 34:14.177

for a lousy ten bucks.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.615
-Where you going, Mikey?
-Hey.

34:36.783 --> 34:40.078

I just thought I'd come over.

34:40.703 --> 34:41.662

34:41.746 --> 34:43.623
Yeah, I want to be in on that loan,
you know?

34:43.706 --> 34:44.832
I want to back that guy.

Get in.

35:19.283 --> 35:20.451
A crush.

35:23.287 --> 35:24.455
Well, what else are you doing here?

35:24.539 --> 35:26.707
What's this vibe
I'm getting off of you, huh?

35:29.210 --> 35:31.629
I don't know.
Maybe I got a little crush on you.

35:32.797 --> 35:33.965
You ever kiss a guy, Mike?

35:36.717 --> 35:38.594
I mean, not like your father or something.

35:39.178 --> 35:42.223
Like a man... on the lips.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.141
No.

35:43.599 --> 35:45.143
'Cause I gotta tell you something.

35:45.601 --> 35:48.855
From the very first time in the bar,
I had eyes for you.

35:49.522 --> 35:51.732
I mean, to me,
you're like a beautiful little monkey.

35:54.527 --> 35:56.070
(gunshots)

35:57.697 --> 35:59.365
-What's going on?
-What?

36:00.408 --> 36:02.160
-(engine starts)
-Oh, my God.

36:02.243 --> 36:03.411
Hey, just calm down.

36:03.494 --> 36:05.705
You're not even supposed
to be here, you understand?

36:08.040 --> 36:10.960
-What's he doing here?
-I was just explaining it to him, Mr. F.

36:11.043 --> 36:12.962
He'll explain! Bring him to the Deuce!

36:13.045 --> 36:14.589
You're with him till then, Jimmy.

36:18.885 --> 36:19.927
Now look what you did.

36:22.805 --> 36:24.015
(engine starts)

36:28.686 --> 36:29.854
HOWARD: How is he, Doctor?

36:30.897 --> 36:32.857
-Lieutenant.
-MAN: Quack-quack.

36:32.940 --> 36:34.650
-Nice shooting, Lieutenant.
-Thank you.

36:35.568 --> 36:37.904
His fever's that high?
What about his vital signs?

36:39.739 --> 36:40.615
I'm on my way.

36:48.748 --> 36:50.833
Mr. Heedlock. Grand larceny.

36:50.917 --> 36:52.585
Complainant: Millie Heedlock.

36:52.668 --> 36:55.379
There he is. Mr. Airplane.

36:55.463 --> 36:59.383
Mr. B-52 and his tramp!
They caught you, and I'm glad.

36:59.467 --> 37:01.844
Did you think I was gonna stay
with you, old bag?

37:02.303 --> 37:04.180
You're too tired, too ugly.

37:04.597 --> 37:06.974
Come on, we'll take your statement
in the squad room.

37:07.058 --> 37:07.892
Come this way.

37:08.226 --> 37:11.270
The two of them were in the hotel
by the airport. Just like she said.

37:12.063 --> 37:14.774
Having a midair collision. (chuckles)

37:17.026 --> 37:18.986
Ah, so soon we meet again.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.738
Ships in the night, Mr. Heedlock.

37:21.239 --> 37:24.075
You're not indigent,
and I'm going on vacation in two days.

37:24.158 --> 37:25.076
You'll be reassigned.

37:25.409 --> 37:27.078
Hey, where you going? Antigua?

37:27.370 --> 37:29.330
I'll make bail again.
I'll see you down there.

37:29.705 --> 37:30.665
Okay, Mr. Heedlock.

37:31.415 --> 37:33.459
JOE: Hey, Renko, ready for tonight?

37:33.542 --> 37:36.128
I have reservations
on this rehearsal dinner, Joseph.

37:36.545 --> 37:37.964
What do you mean?
It's still at the Kubiak, right?

37:38.047 --> 37:40.424
No, no, that's not what I mean.
What I mean is, I'm concerned.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.718
It's my first chance
I'm going to meet my new relations,

37:42.802 --> 37:44.512
and I want everything to go perfect.

37:44.595 --> 37:46.347
The little fork's for the salads, Joe.

37:47.682 --> 37:49.058
Hey, what am I, Conan?

37:51.602 --> 37:53.479
-Kubiak.
-7:30.

37:53.562 --> 37:55.481
Bates. How many?

37:56.315 --> 37:57.149
Address.

37:58.693 --> 37:59.527
Got it.

38:00.569 --> 38:01.404
Captain!

38:03.155 --> 38:05.658
We got a gang hit. Five bodies.
One of them Marcus Peabody.

38:05.741 --> 38:07.618
-Did Belker phone it in?
-No, a citizen.

38:07.910 --> 38:09.453
-Where?
-47th and Butler.

38:09.537 --> 38:12.081
It's a warehouse. They say it's bad,
it's a slaughterhouse.

38:15.793 --> 38:18.129
(sirens wailing)

38:32.768 --> 38:34.562
(indistinct chatter)

38:34.645 --> 38:36.105
MAN: Make sure we get enough shots.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.316
Captain Furillo?

38:38.399 --> 38:40.776
-We're gonna need the 901.
-MAN 2: It was a brutal massacre.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.323
Members of two gangs
which had previously been...

38:45.406 --> 38:48.117
RAY: ...information
so I can have the report ready.

38:51.704 --> 38:54.373
One Blood survivor. He said he was mobbed.

38:54.457 --> 38:56.167
When was the last contact
we had with Belker?

38:56.250 --> 38:57.209
Hour and a half.

38:57.626 --> 38:58.753
We have to find him.

38:59.378 --> 39:02.548
The Deuce, the Marin Club.
The joint down by the ferry.

39:02.631 --> 39:05.176
-Every one of their places. Let's move.
-All right, Frank.

39:14.685 --> 39:16.228
I don't want to hear about it anymore!

39:16.312 --> 39:18.939
It's your business
till it interferes with my business!

39:19.023 --> 39:21.150
Jimmy and I had this conversation
a long time ago.

39:21.233 --> 39:23.819
-No argument, Mr. Franco.
-"Oh, Mike's a right guy.

39:23.903 --> 39:26.572
Mike's just following me around
because he's got a crush!"

39:26.655 --> 39:27.531
(spits)

39:27.615 --> 39:29.450
Why should I have to worry about this?

39:29.533 --> 39:31.619
Huh? And what you seen or didn't see?

39:32.620 --> 39:33.996
He didn't see nothing, Mr. F.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.873
Why should I have to worry about it?

39:42.338 --> 39:44.507
Now what's it gonna be
between the two of you, huh?

39:46.300 --> 39:47.343
Up in the air.

39:47.802 --> 39:49.595
Because you come in here
with a little fresh dough,

39:49.678 --> 39:51.222
you think it's a big deal to me?

39:51.305 --> 39:52.139
I'd cut your heart out

39:52.223 --> 39:53.432
-as soon as look at you.
-(tires screeching in distance)

39:53.516 --> 39:56.060
You wanna continue to do business,
don't give me no more aggravation,

39:56.143 --> 39:57.436
-you understand?
-Yes, sir.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.938
MAN (on megaphone): This is the police.

39:59.021 --> 40:01.148
Lester Franco and all associates,

40:01.232 --> 40:02.858
- come out with your hands up.
-I don't believe this!

40:02.942 --> 40:03.984
This is a lot of crap!

40:04.068 --> 40:06.237
MAN (on megaphone):
I repeat, come out with your hands up.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.572
-You have 15 seconds.
-Did you get 'em all? No witnesses?

40:08.656 --> 40:11.450
-Took 'em all out.
-All right, put the damn pieces down!

40:12.118 --> 40:13.619
And open up the damn door!

40:14.662 --> 40:15.913
This is wonderful!

40:15.996 --> 40:17.498
(clattering)

40:19.166 --> 40:21.043
-All right, back up.
-Come on.

40:21.127 --> 40:22.878
(overlapping chatter)

40:25.965 --> 40:26.799
Hey.

40:29.718 --> 40:31.846
I'm a cop, you dirt ball!

40:33.305 --> 40:34.306
Mikey.

40:36.142 --> 40:38.727
Great, Jimmy. You just killed us.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.689
(indistinct chatter)

40:48.946 --> 40:49.822
(glass clinking)

40:50.281 --> 40:51.866
I'd like to propose a toast.

40:54.785 --> 40:57.621
Uh, I'd just like to say,

40:58.289 --> 40:59.331
first of all, that I never thought

40:59.415 --> 41:01.959
I'd see the day that Andy Renko
would tie the knot.

41:02.042 --> 41:04.628
And you still ain't seen that day,
Joe Coffey.

41:04.712 --> 41:06.589
What you are seein' is the day before.

41:06.797 --> 41:08.215
JOE:
Yeah, well, you'll be there tomorrow,

41:08.299 --> 41:11.385
because any guy would be a jerk
to walk out on a bride

41:11.469 --> 41:14.138
as sweet and as lovely as Daryl Ann.

41:14.763 --> 41:17.558
So I just wish you
all the happiness there is.

41:17.641 --> 41:18.642
LUCY: Good luck.

41:21.979 --> 41:22.813
Okay.

41:24.273 --> 41:27.109
I tried to find
a really great toast somewhere,

41:27.193 --> 41:29.236
but they all seemed sort of corny,

41:29.320 --> 41:32.990
so I just wish you good luck and, uh,

41:34.283 --> 41:36.327
I hope you have a terrific life together,

41:37.578 --> 41:39.455
and I think you make
a really great couple.

41:40.122 --> 41:42.249
-Cheer-cheer.
-JOE: <i>Salute. Salute.</i>

41:49.423 --> 41:50.466
Thank you, Lucille.

41:50.549 --> 41:53.594
Uh, Mr. and Mrs. McConnicke,
I'd like to thank you all

41:53.677 --> 41:55.095
for coming and joining us tonight,

41:55.179 --> 41:58.641
and I look forward to meeting
all my new relations come tomorrow.

41:59.433 --> 42:02.478
Uh, Joe, Lucille, Neal...

42:03.187 --> 42:04.897
it's times like this when one realizes

42:04.980 --> 42:07.358
how close one's friends are
when you come to join me

42:07.441 --> 42:10.528
at an important time like this
for me in my life,

42:10.611 --> 42:13.781
and I'd like to toast my Daryl Ann,

42:14.615 --> 42:17.326
who is the most important thing
that ever happened to me.

42:18.410 --> 42:19.495
I love you, darlin'.

42:20.287 --> 42:22.623
NEAL (chuckles): All right.

42:22.706 --> 42:24.708
And Bobby Hill,

42:25.084 --> 42:28.045
who had a small part
in making me realize that.

42:29.380 --> 42:30.297
God bless you all.

42:32.132 --> 42:32.967
(clears throat)

42:34.969 --> 42:39.056
Well, I'm not much for making toasts.

42:39.807 --> 42:42.977
I'm about as good at that
as Daryl Ann is at taking precautions.

42:43.060 --> 42:44.144
Daddy!

42:45.312 --> 42:48.274
(clears throat)
But, uh, I want to say that I hope

42:48.857 --> 42:50.609
the couple has a happy future...

42:51.068 --> 42:51.902
(clears throat)

42:52.152 --> 42:54.321
And I guess with so many police,

42:54.405 --> 42:56.407
y'all never have to worry
about parking tickets.

42:56.490 --> 42:57.825
-(laughing)
-That's right.

42:58.158 --> 43:01.412
Or whatever part of town
y'all find yourselves in.

43:01.996 --> 43:04.331
And I've gotten a chance
to know Bobby Hill a little,

43:04.415 --> 43:06.584
and he seems like a real nice boy.

43:09.003 --> 43:11.255
Best wishes to everybody.

43:15.759 --> 43:16.594
(Bobby clears throat)

43:17.886 --> 43:19.471
Uh, well, now...

43:20.431 --> 43:22.891
Um, I want to thank Mr. McConnicke

43:22.975 --> 43:25.019
and say it's a good thing he likes me

43:25.102 --> 43:27.521
since I'm sure he's quite familiar
with the old tradition

43:27.605 --> 43:30.524
that if anything happens to the groom
before the wedding,

43:30.608 --> 43:33.319
then the best man
is supposed to step right on in.

43:33.402 --> 43:34.612
(laughter)

43:34.695 --> 43:37.114
Well, I don't know what tradition that is,

43:37.906 --> 43:39.408
but anybody runs out on my little girl

43:39.491 --> 43:42.786
and I'm perfectly willing
to take care of her and him myself.

43:42.870 --> 43:45.998
(laughs) I don't know what either one
of you guys are talking about

43:46.081 --> 43:50.044
'cause you couldn't get me away
from this beautiful girl with a tow truck.

43:50.127 --> 43:52.379
Oh, that's not
what anybody's talking about, Andy.

43:57.551 --> 44:00.763
So, uh, you folks have a nice trip up?

44:05.184 --> 44:06.268
You take the interstate?

44:10.314 --> 44:12.024
JOYCE:
I knew he was lying through his teeth.

44:12.566 --> 44:15.569
I knew he wanted to get into court
before his out-of-states did.

44:16.362 --> 44:18.113
And I knew he was going to skip bail.

44:20.115 --> 44:21.241
And I couldn't have cared less.

44:22.159 --> 44:24.161
If you had,
would you have done the job differently?

44:26.580 --> 44:28.207
Not caring just made it easier.

44:29.667 --> 44:30.501
(sighs)

44:31.293 --> 44:35.589
To be filed under the category of
"What kind of lawyer am I becoming?"

44:39.301 --> 44:40.511
You always liked scampi.

44:43.097 --> 44:43.972
I still do.

44:49.603 --> 44:51.772
I'll have to stop by the apartment
and pick up a few things.

44:52.773 --> 44:54.983
-You don't have to ask permission.
-I wasn't.

44:57.861 --> 45:00.739
If I go away for a couple of weeks,
you should use the apartment.

45:00.948 --> 45:01.782
I don't think so,

45:02.908 --> 45:04.660
but I'll still have to know your plans.

45:05.703 --> 45:06.620
Sure.

45:06.704 --> 45:08.038
I have to make plans, too.

45:09.289 --> 45:12.209
I don't know whether
to expect a card from the Shore...

45:14.378 --> 45:15.713
or a phone call from your lawyer.

45:16.130 --> 45:17.423
Do you think
you're going to want a divorce?

45:17.506 --> 45:18.340
I don't think so,

45:19.967 --> 45:21.635
but I'm tired of being unhappy, Frank.

45:22.553 --> 45:24.513
I'm tired of feeling lost inside.

45:25.597 --> 45:28.308
I need two weeks of solitary
just to locate myself.

45:29.518 --> 45:30.519
Is there someone else?

45:38.402 --> 45:39.862
Don't you know how much I love you,
Pizza Man?

45:39.945 --> 45:41.196
Then why is this happening?

45:42.990 --> 45:45.200
(sighs) Loving each other is no guarantee

45:45.284 --> 45:48.078
-we can make each other happy.
-You make me happy.

45:49.246 --> 45:50.914
How can you be happy if I'm not?

45:51.165 --> 45:54.084
The simple fact of you in my life
means everything to me.

45:55.127 --> 45:58.088
I don't want that much power, Frank.
It's suffocating me.

46:03.218 --> 46:05.929
Well, uh, when you get back
maybe we should see somebody,

46:06.597 --> 46:07.431
get some help.

46:08.056 --> 46:09.641
That's probably a good idea.

46:10.768 --> 46:12.019
On the bright side...

46:14.438 --> 46:16.023
-at least we have our health.
-(laughs)

46:18.525 --> 46:19.985
(thunder rumbles)

46:28.202 --> 46:29.036
(horse neighs)

46:33.749 --> 46:34.583
I'm back.

46:37.002 --> 46:38.670
Rain ought to settle this dust.

46:46.678 --> 46:48.472
Boy, iron content's a little high.

46:48.555 --> 46:50.265
We'll have to see about a softener.

46:53.519 --> 46:55.145
(groans)

46:57.898 --> 47:01.109
Good boy. My good boy.

47:02.444 --> 47:04.571
We got to get you shod one of these days.

47:04.655 --> 47:06.198
Those damn city streets.

47:06.573 --> 47:10.118
Hmm, try that kid
with the freckles this time.

47:10.202 --> 47:11.453
(whinnies)

47:11.537 --> 47:12.955
Yeah, mm.

47:14.289 --> 47:16.667
Can't find a decent smith anymore.

47:18.794 --> 47:20.003
Sweet boy.

47:29.346 --> 47:32.057
Damn. That wood's not treated.

47:34.059 --> 47:35.853
You'll get splinters.

47:36.603 --> 47:37.521
(sighs)

47:42.901 --> 47:44.194

48:14.808 --> 48:15.767
