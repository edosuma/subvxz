WEBVTT

00:08.443 --> 00:10.184
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT TO GO TO THE MANOR?

00:10.358 --> 00:11.750
I MEAN, IT'S GONNA BE
KIND OF CRAMPED HERE.

00:11.924 --> 00:13.448
NO, IT'S BIGGER
THAN A CAVE.

00:13.622 --> 00:15.450
I MEAN, IT WORKS FOR ME
IF IT WORKS FOR YOU.

00:15.624 --> 00:17.452
YEAH, I DON'T EVEN COME
HERE THAT MUCH ANYMORE.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.541
IN FACT, I DON'T THINK
I EVER WANT TO COME BACK.

00:19.715 --> 00:22.065
WELL, CAN'T YOU JUST
GET A BIGGER DORM?

00:22.239 --> 00:24.850
NO, NOT THE DORM.
I MEAN SCHOOL.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.591
SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED.

00:26.765 --> 00:29.333
BILLIE, YOU CAN'T QUIT NOW.
YOU HAVE TO GRADUATE.

00:29.507 --> 00:30.856
MOM AND DAD WOULD
WANT YOU TO.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.511
WELL, MOM AND DAD AREN'T
HERE ANYMORE, ARE THEY?

00:33.685 --> 00:37.515
I'M SORRY. JUST A LITTLE
TIRED RIGHT NOW.

00:37.689 --> 00:39.952
I KNOW.

00:40.127 --> 00:43.913
THIS HAS BEEN REALLY...
HARD FOR BOTH OF US.

00:44.087 --> 00:45.784
I JUST STILL CAN'T
BELIEVE THEY'RE GONE.

00:45.958 --> 00:46.829
I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE--

00:47.003 --> 00:47.960
IT'S NOT YOUR
FAULT, OK?

00:48.135 --> 00:49.266
A DEMON
MURDERED THEM.

00:49.440 --> 00:50.963
YEAH, BUT IF I WOULDN'T
HAVE LEFT THEM,

00:51.138 --> 00:52.269
MAYBE THEY WOULD
STILL BE HERE.

00:52.443 --> 00:54.097
OR IF PIPER HADN'T
CALLED YOU AWAY.

00:54.271 --> 00:56.012
THIS IS NOT HER FAULT.

00:56.186 --> 00:58.101
OH, IT ISN'T?

00:58.275 --> 01:01.322
YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:01.496 --> 01:03.541
YOU JUST STAY HERE,
OK? YOU REST.

01:03.715 --> 01:04.673
WE'RE GONNA GET
THROUGH THIS.

01:04.847 --> 01:05.804
I PROMISE.

01:05.978 --> 01:07.806
I PROMISE, TOGETHER.

01:07.980 --> 01:10.548
I WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN
ABLE TO GET THROUGH
THIS WEEK WITHOUT YOU.

01:10.722 --> 01:13.247
WELL, I'D STILL BE...

01:13.421 --> 01:15.727
LIVING IN A CAVE
WITHOUT YOU.

01:17.164 --> 01:18.121
I'LL BE BACK.

01:18.295 --> 01:20.428
WHAT? WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

01:20.602 --> 01:22.082
I'M GONNA HELP
MY LITTLE SISTER

01:22.256 --> 01:23.431
GET SOME
PEACE OF MIND.

01:23.605 --> 01:24.867
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
THE POLICE MIGHT THINK

01:25.041 --> 01:26.390
THAT MOM AND DAD
ARE AN UNSOLVED CASE,

01:26.564 --> 01:28.044
BUT WE KNOW BETTER.

01:28.218 --> 01:29.915
THE NOXON DEMON
CAN'T BE VANQUISHED.
YOU KNOW THAT.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.178
THEN I'LL HIT HIM
WITH A POTION,

01:31.352 --> 01:32.570
AND I'LL SEND HIM
TO THE ASTRAL PLANE

01:32.744 --> 01:33.876
LIKE PIPER DID TO
THE OTHER DEMONS.

01:34.050 --> 01:35.225
BUT SHE CAN'T
FIND HIM.

01:35.399 --> 01:36.748
THEN I'LL HELP
HER, BILLIE.

01:38.359 --> 01:40.578
YOU LET ME WORRY
ABOUT THE DEMONS.

01:40.752 --> 01:43.059
YOU JUST GET SOME REST.

01:48.891 --> 01:51.198
THE NOXON WON'T
BE EASY TO FIND.

01:51.372 --> 01:54.331
HE'S ON THE RUN.
HE'S CAGEY.

01:54.505 --> 01:56.942
BUT WE WILL SCOUR
THE UNDERWORLD.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.423
WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO FIND HIM.

01:59.597 --> 02:00.903
I DON'T LIKE IT.

02:01.077 --> 02:02.948
VANQUISHING
A FELLOW DEMON?

02:03.123 --> 02:06.126
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO VANQUISH HIM.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.171
NOT UNTIL WE CAN
USE HIM TO SEPARATE

02:08.345 --> 02:10.086
THE OTHER SISTER
FROM THE CHARMED ONES.

02:10.260 --> 02:11.479
YEAH, BUT WHY DO
WE HAVE TO DO

02:11.653 --> 02:12.784
WHAT THE TRIAD
WANTS ANYMORE?

02:12.958 --> 02:13.785
THEY'RE DEAD.

02:13.959 --> 02:15.570
NEVERTHELESS...

02:15.744 --> 02:17.049
WE DO WHAT
WE'RE TOLD.

02:19.661 --> 02:21.576
SAYS WHO?

02:23.055 --> 02:24.970
[SCREAMING]

02:25.145 --> 02:27.408
WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:27.582 --> 02:28.583
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

02:28.757 --> 02:31.455
NO. NOT ANYMORE.

02:33.849 --> 02:36.243
WE'RE HERE TO HELP.

03:42.091 --> 03:44.136
[DOOR OPENS]

03:44.311 --> 03:46.138
HEY, THERE.

03:46.313 --> 03:47.749
WHAT TOOK YOU
SO LONG?

03:47.923 --> 03:50.969
UH, I WAS DROPPING
THE BOYS OFF AT DAD'S.

03:51.143 --> 03:52.971
WHY? WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

03:53.145 --> 03:54.146
OH, YOU KNOW.

03:54.321 --> 03:55.539
JUST IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

03:55.713 --> 03:57.846
THOUGHT I'D DROP BY,
SEE HOW YOU'RE DOING.

03:58.020 --> 03:58.977
HOW GO THE BATTLES?

03:59.151 --> 04:00.631
THE BATTLES?

04:00.805 --> 04:02.981
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
ULTIMATE POWER,
ULTIMATE THREAT.

04:03.155 --> 04:03.982
ULTIMATE STUFF.

04:04.156 --> 04:05.506
NEED ANY HELP?

04:05.680 --> 04:07.377
YOU JUST GOT BACK
FROM YOUR HONEYMOON

04:07.551 --> 04:08.857
AND YOU WANT TO
TALK ABOUT DEMONS?

04:09.031 --> 04:11.338
WELL, IT IS WHAT
WE DO, ISN'T IT?

04:11.512 --> 04:14.645
YOU'RE GIVING ME
A VERY SUSPICIOUS LOOK.

04:14.819 --> 04:16.517
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE
A VERY SUSPICIOUS PERSON.

04:16.691 --> 04:17.953
AND YOU'RE AVOIDING
THE QUESTION.

04:18.127 --> 04:19.084
I AM NOT.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.217
ALL RIGHT, FINE,
MAYBE I AM.

04:21.391 --> 04:23.045
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
I DON'T WANT TO HELP

04:23.219 --> 04:25.700
OUT OF THE GOODNESS
OF MY OWN HEART.

04:25.874 --> 04:27.267
MM-HMM.

04:27.441 --> 04:29.051
I THINK YOU NEED
TO TALK TO HENRY.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.141
ABOUT WHAT?
ABOUT DEMONS?

04:32.315 --> 04:34.883
NO, ABOUT WHATEVER
IT IS YOU CAME HERE
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT

04:35.057 --> 04:36.406
THAT YOU SHOULD BE
TALKING TO HIM ABOUT.

04:36.580 --> 04:37.407
[GROANS]

04:37.581 --> 04:39.453
I CAN'T TELL
HIM ABOUT IT

04:39.627 --> 04:41.498
'CAUSE IT'S JUST GONNA
HURT HIS FEELINGS.

04:41.672 --> 04:43.108
THAT'S NOT A GOOD
ENOUGH REASON.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.109
[SCOFFS]

04:44.284 --> 04:45.502
THE PROBLEM IS,

04:45.676 --> 04:47.591
IS THAT IT'S NOT HENRY'S
FAULT AT ALL, OK?

04:47.765 --> 04:48.897
HE'S AMAZING.
I LOVE HIM.

04:49.071 --> 04:50.942
I CAN SEE WHY
YOU'RE AVOIDING HIM.

04:51.116 --> 04:54.032
SEE THE THING IS,
IT TOOK ME SO LONG
TO FORGE AN IDENTITY

04:54.206 --> 04:55.469
SEPARATE OF YOU
AND PHOEBE.

04:55.643 --> 04:57.384
I'M JUST--I GUESS
I'M KIND OF AFRAID

04:57.558 --> 04:59.908
OF LOSING MYSELF
IN THE MARRIAGE.

05:00.082 --> 05:01.866
SO YOU'RE BURYING
YOURSELF IN DEMONS?

05:02.040 --> 05:03.564
IT COULD WORK
FOR ME.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.435
I DON'T APPROVE OF THE WAY
YOU'RE HANDLING THIS.

05:05.609 --> 05:08.220
ANYWAY, I THINK
I HAVE A LEAD.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.222
IF THE NOXON DEMONS

05:10.397 --> 05:12.573
KILLED CHRISTY
AND BILLIE'S PARENTS,

05:12.747 --> 05:14.749
SOMEBODY ELSE HAD TO
SEND THEM TO DO IT.

05:14.923 --> 05:15.880
BECAUSE THEY WERE
ORIGINALLY AFTER

05:16.054 --> 05:17.665
THE MAGIC SCHOOL
KIDS, RIGHT?

05:17.839 --> 05:19.754
RIGHT. SO WHY
CHANGE THEIR M.O.?

05:19.928 --> 05:21.495
UNLESS SOMEBODY
TOLD THEM TO.

05:21.669 --> 05:23.975
WHOEVER IT IS THAT'S AFTER
THE KEY TO THE ULTIMATE POWER.

05:24.149 --> 05:25.629
DO YOU THINK THEY WERE
REALLY AFTER CHRISTY?

05:25.803 --> 05:26.891
ABSOLUTELY,
WHICH MEANS

05:27.065 --> 05:29.503
THE NOXONS KNOW
WHO'S BEHIND IT ALL.

05:29.677 --> 05:32.897
AND MAYBE WHO WE'LL HAVE
TO FIGHT TO GET LEO BACK.

05:33.071 --> 05:34.508
SO, UH, WHAT'S THE PLAN?

05:34.682 --> 05:37.162
GOING TO FIND THAT
GENETIC FREAK OF A DEMON

05:37.337 --> 05:38.512
AND TELL HIM
WE'RE GONNA DO TO HIM

05:38.686 --> 05:40.775
WHAT WE DID TO HIS FRIEND
UNLESS HE TALKS.

05:40.949 --> 05:43.473
WHAT CAN I DO BESIDES PONDER
THE STATE OF MY MARRIAGE?

05:43.647 --> 05:44.648
YOU NEED TO GO DOWN
TO THE UNDERWORLD

05:44.822 --> 05:45.780
AND SEE IF YOU
CAN FIND HIM.

05:45.954 --> 05:47.608
DONE.

05:47.782 --> 05:49.305
BE CAREFUL.

05:56.225 --> 05:57.966
OOH! [GRUNTING]

06:02.840 --> 06:04.929
Man: WHAT HAVE WE HERE?

06:06.366 --> 06:08.368
WHO ARE YOU?

06:08.542 --> 06:09.630
STAY BACK!

06:09.804 --> 06:12.110
OR WHAT?

06:12.284 --> 06:13.982
SHE'S NOT JUST
CLUTCHING YOUR LEG.

06:14.156 --> 06:15.418
SHE'S CLUTCHING
YOUR POWERS.

06:16.811 --> 06:19.466
IT'LL COME IN HANDY
WHEN I FEED OFF OF YOU.

06:22.643 --> 06:25.341
WHAT'S A LOW-LEVEL
DEMON LIKE YOU

06:25.515 --> 06:26.995
DOING IN THIS NECK
OF THE UNDERWORLD?

06:27.169 --> 06:28.779
I'M NOT LOW-LEVEL.

06:31.434 --> 06:32.870
I'M WORKING
WITH THE TRIAD.

06:33.044 --> 06:34.089
THE TRIAD?

06:34.263 --> 06:36.091
YEAH, YEAH.

06:36.265 --> 06:38.572
I'M HELPING THEM HARNESS
THE ULTIMATE POWER,
SO IF YOU'RE SMART--

06:38.746 --> 06:39.834
THE TRIAD'S DEAD.

06:40.008 --> 06:42.924
RIGHT. EXACTLY.

06:43.098 --> 06:44.360
WHICH MEANS I'M
THE ONLY ONE LEFT

06:44.534 --> 06:46.014
WHO KNOWS WHERE TO FIND
THE ULTIMATE POWER.

06:46.188 --> 06:48.059
RELEASE ME AND ALL
THE POWER IN THE WORLD

06:48.233 --> 06:49.452
IS YOURS, I PROMISE.

06:49.626 --> 06:51.454
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
GET IT FOR YOURSELF?

06:51.628 --> 06:53.500
THE POWER HAS
YET TO EMERGE.

06:53.674 --> 06:55.284
UNTIL IT DOES,
I MUST HIDE.

06:55.458 --> 06:58.156
DEMONS ARE AFTER ME.
AND POWERFUL WITCHES.

06:58.330 --> 07:00.289
THE CHARMED ONES.

07:00.463 --> 07:02.291
I'M TELLING
THE TRUTH, I SWEAR.

07:02.465 --> 07:04.206
WELL...

07:04.380 --> 07:05.990
SEEING AS HOW
YOU'RE SO NEATLY

07:06.164 --> 07:07.209
TIED UP
AT THE MOMENT,

07:07.383 --> 07:09.080
I THINK I'LL JUST
LEAVE YOU HERE,

07:09.254 --> 07:12.214
SEE WHO COMES LOOKING.

07:12.388 --> 07:14.521
NO. COME BACK!

07:14.695 --> 07:16.305
THEY'LL FIND ME!

07:16.479 --> 07:17.872
I'M TELLING YOU,
I FOUND HIM.

07:18.046 --> 07:19.221
I FOUND YOU A MATCH,

07:19.395 --> 07:22.180
AND HE COULD BE
THE MAN OF YOUR DREAMS.

07:22.354 --> 07:25.183
PHOEBE!
HELLO?

07:25.357 --> 07:26.576
AM I MAKING
MYSELF CLEAR?

07:26.750 --> 07:29.100
HELLO, I'M WORKING.
DO YOU SEE ME WORKING?

07:29.274 --> 07:31.973
YEAH, YEAH.
SO AM I.

07:32.147 --> 07:34.323
HOW ABOUT MICHAEL?
COOP.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.630
ALSO HAPPENS TO BE
THE STYLE EDITOR

07:36.804 --> 07:37.805
AT YOUR PAPER,
NO LESS.

07:37.979 --> 07:39.459
WHICH PROBABLY
MAKES HIM GAY, OK?

07:39.633 --> 07:41.330
I KNOW WHO HE IS,
AND NO, THANK YOU.

07:41.504 --> 07:42.853
HE'S NOT GAY.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.942
TRUST ME, I WOULDN'T BE
SETTING YOU UP WITH HIM.

07:45.116 --> 07:47.249
SO WHY DON'T YOU
GO OUT WITH HIM, HUH?

07:47.423 --> 07:49.860
WELL, MAYBE BECAUSE
I DON'T LIKE TO DATE

07:50.034 --> 07:51.383
PEOPLE AT
THE WORKPLACE.

07:51.558 --> 07:52.994
DID YOU EVER
THINK OF THAT?

07:53.168 --> 07:55.431
MMM, YEAH, YEAH.
OF COURSE I THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT.

07:55.605 --> 07:57.912
I THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING
WHEN IT COMES TO MATCHMAKING.

07:58.086 --> 08:01.655
BESIDES, YOU MET
JASON AT WORK

08:01.829 --> 08:05.006
AND LESLIE
AND DEX.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.661
YEAH, AND THOSE DIDN'T
GO TOO WELL FOR ME, DID THEY?

08:07.835 --> 08:10.098
YEAH, BUT NOT BECAUSE
YOU WORKED WITH THEM.

08:10.272 --> 08:12.666
IT'S BECAUSE OF, YOU
KNOW, OTHER REASONS.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.755
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO MARRY THE GUY.

08:14.929 --> 08:16.539
JUST GO OUT WITH HIM.

08:16.713 --> 08:18.889
LET ME SEE HOW CLOSE I AM
TO FIGURING YOU OUT, HUH?

08:19.063 --> 08:20.238
WHAT DO YOU GOT
TO LOSE, HUH?

08:20.412 --> 08:21.588
TAKE A RISK.

08:21.762 --> 08:23.372
IT'S JUST THE WHOLE
PROCESS, YOU KNOW?

08:23.546 --> 08:26.854
LIKE DATING AND THEN
OPENING UP TO SOMEONE

08:27.028 --> 08:28.682
AND THEN HAVING TO
TELL THEM THAT I'M A WITCH.

08:28.856 --> 08:30.684
THEM FAINTING.
IT'S JUST NOT FUN.

08:30.858 --> 08:33.904
OH, YOU ARE SO
CONFUSING TO ME.
I DON'T GET IT.

08:34.078 --> 08:36.037
FIRST YOU TELL ME
YOU DON'T WANT TO
DATE MAGICAL BEINGS.

08:36.211 --> 08:37.429
AND THEN YOU DON'T
WANT TO DATE MORTALS.

08:37.604 --> 08:39.344
WHO'S LEFT?

08:39.519 --> 08:40.824
YEAH, YEAH.
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

08:40.998 --> 08:42.304
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW HARD IT IS

08:42.478 --> 08:44.132
TO FIND A MATCH
FOR YOU, PHOEBE?

08:44.306 --> 08:46.351
YOU ARE A SMART,
SUCCESSFUL,

08:46.526 --> 08:48.789
GORGEOUS WOMAN WITH
A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR

08:48.963 --> 08:50.138
AND AMAZING STRENGTH.

08:50.312 --> 08:52.053
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'RE LOUNGING AROUND

08:52.227 --> 08:57.624
IN A TRACK SUIT WITH
A PENCIL IN YOUR HAIR
AND GLASSES, AND...

08:57.798 --> 09:00.235
YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

09:02.063 --> 09:03.804
REALLY?

09:03.978 --> 09:05.240
YEAH, YEAH.

09:05.414 --> 09:06.850
I'M JUST--
[LAUGHS]

09:07.024 --> 09:08.635
JUST, YOU KNOW,
TRYING TO SEE

09:08.809 --> 09:09.897
WHAT MICHAEL
SEES IN YOU,

09:10.071 --> 09:11.159
OR WOULD SEE IN YOU

09:11.333 --> 09:12.334
IF YOU'D GO OUT
WITH THE GUY.

09:12.508 --> 09:13.944
OK, WELL, WHAT
ABOUT MY COLUMN?

09:14.118 --> 09:15.859
AND EVERYTHING
PIPER'S GOING THROUGH?

09:16.033 --> 09:19.167
I MEAN, DOESN'T LOVE
PALE IN COMPARISON
TO ALL OF THAT?

09:19.341 --> 09:20.864
NO, YOU DON'T GET IT.

09:21.038 --> 09:22.518
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY
TIMES I NEED TO TELL YOU.

09:22.692 --> 09:25.652
LOVE DOESN'T PALE IN
COMPARISON TO ANYTHING.

09:25.826 --> 09:29.177

TO YOU GUSH ABOUT HER
FOR ONCE, HUH?

26:45.865 --> 26:47.475
Paige:
AWW. YOU GUSH ABOUT ME?

26:47.649 --> 26:48.868
YEAH, I DO.

26:49.042 --> 26:50.609
NO, YOU DON'T.
YOU WON'T.

26:50.783 --> 26:53.176
YOU CHECKED IN
ON TIME, SO NOW
YOU CAN GO.

26:53.350 --> 26:56.049
AND WE'LL SEE YOU
THE SAME TIME TOMORROW.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.442
GREAT.YEAH. RIGHT.

26:58.617 --> 26:59.530
MM-HMM.
YEAH.

26:59.705 --> 27:00.793
SEE YA.

27:00.967 --> 27:02.838
OK. GET HOME SAFE.

27:07.669 --> 27:09.497
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS FAST.

27:09.671 --> 27:11.934
Paige: I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.

27:16.722 --> 27:17.636
WHOA.

27:17.810 --> 27:18.767
WHOA YOURSELF.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.377
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

27:20.551 --> 27:21.857
Paige: ASK IF THEY'VE HAD
ANY LUCK FINDING--

27:22.031 --> 27:23.729
HOLD IT A SECOND.

27:23.903 --> 27:25.469
I THINK IT'LL BE EASIER
IF I JUST TALK TO THEM
MYSELF, HONEY.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.471
HONEY? ARE YOU OK?

27:27.646 --> 27:29.386
UH...YEAH.
I'M--I'M FINE.

27:29.560 --> 27:32.389
Paige: NO, YOU'RE NOT,
AND NEITHER AM I.

27:32.563 --> 27:34.478
WHY ARE YOU TALKING
TO YOURSELF?

27:34.653 --> 27:37.351
NO, I'M NOT. UH...
PAIGE IS IN MY HEAD.

27:37.525 --> 27:40.223
Paige: TELL HER I WENT
TO COOP FOR ADVICE.

27:40.397 --> 27:42.530
PLEASE. I CAN HANDLE
THIS, PAIGE.

27:42.704 --> 27:43.836
Paige: SORRY.

27:44.010 --> 27:45.489
COOP DID IT.

27:45.664 --> 27:46.795
COOP DID IT.

27:46.969 --> 27:48.928
OF COURSE HE DID. GREAT.

27:49.102 --> 27:50.886
WELL, YOU NEED TO GET HIM
TO UNDO IT

27:51.060 --> 27:52.671
BECAUSE WE NEED
THE POWER OF THREE
TO FIND THE NOXON.

27:52.845 --> 27:54.411
Paige: I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO DO IT FROM HERE.

27:54.585 --> 27:55.935
[SIGHS] UM...

27:56.109 --> 27:59.242
PAIGE THINKS THAT SHE--
HEADACHE--

27:59.416 --> 28:02.768
PAIGE THINKS THAT
SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO
DO IT FROM WHERE SHE IS.

28:02.942 --> 28:05.684
[FRONT DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES]

28:10.427 --> 28:12.168
BILLIE.

28:12.342 --> 28:13.561
WE NEED TO TALK.

28:13.735 --> 28:15.650
I KNOW. I'M SORRY ABOUT
YOUR SISTER, BUT--

28:15.824 --> 28:16.695
HOW ARE YOU?

28:16.869 --> 28:18.044
HOW AM I?
I'M NOT SO GOOD.

28:18.218 --> 28:20.133
HOW COULD YOU ATTACK
MY SISTER?

28:20.307 --> 28:21.656
SHE DIDN'T LEAVE ME
MUCH OF A CHOICE.

28:21.830 --> 28:23.092
SHE WAS GONNA
VANQUISH THE DEMON.

28:23.266 --> 28:24.790
SO YOU JUST THOUGHT
YOU'D VANQUISH HER, TOO?

28:24.964 --> 28:25.965
NO, I DIDN'T--

28:26.139 --> 28:27.444
LOOK, WE KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL,

28:27.618 --> 28:29.446
BUT REVENGE IS NOT
THE ONLY THING
RIGHT NOW.

28:29.620 --> 28:31.013
THAT'S WHAT CHRISTY SAID.

28:31.187 --> 28:34.495
LOOK, I WANNA FIND LEO, TOO.
I REALLY, REALLY DO.

28:34.669 --> 28:36.323
BUT NOT AT
THE EXPENSE OF HER.

28:36.497 --> 28:38.151
OK, WELL, THEN SHE NEEDS
TO UNDERSTAND

28:38.325 --> 28:40.588
THAT IT CAN'T ALL
BE ABOUT WHAT SHE WANTS.

28:40.762 --> 28:42.677
RIGHT. 'CAUSE IT SEEMS JUST
TO BE ALL ABOUT WHAT YOUWANT.

28:42.851 --> 28:44.635
THAT'S NOT FAIR.ISN'T IT?

28:44.810 --> 28:47.551
OK, LOOK, DON'T YOU
WANNA FIGURE OUT
WHO KILLED YOUR PARENTS?

28:47.726 --> 28:48.944
YES, I DO, BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT.

28:49.118 --> 28:50.816
ALL YOU GUYS CARE ABOUT
IS FINDING LEO.

28:50.990 --> 28:51.947
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME.

28:52.121 --> 28:54.123
BILLIE, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

28:54.297 --> 28:55.472
I'M GONNA VANQUISH
THE NOXON.

28:55.646 --> 28:57.126
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

28:57.300 --> 28:58.824
WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA
BLOW ME UP, TOO?

28:58.998 --> 29:00.129
Paige: HOLD OUT YOUR HAND
AND CALL FOR THE VIAL.

29:00.303 --> 29:02.044
NOBODY'S BLOWING
ANYONE UP HERE.

29:02.218 --> 29:03.306
THAT DIDN'T
STOP HER LAST TIME.

29:03.480 --> 29:04.960
Paige: NOW!
VIAL.

29:08.834 --> 29:10.096
THAT WAS COOL.

29:16.885 --> 29:18.757
BILLIE!
YOU COME BACK HERE!

29:21.585 --> 29:23.109
NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

29:23.283 --> 29:25.589
WE GOTTA FIND THAT DEMON
BEFORE THEY DO.

29:32.466 --> 29:33.510
IS EVERYTHING OK?

29:33.684 --> 29:36.339
YOU WERE RIGHT.
WE ARE ON OUR OWN.

29:46.349 --> 29:47.263
ANY LUCK?

29:47.437 --> 29:49.048
NO, NOTHING.

29:49.222 --> 29:50.614
THERE'S TONS OF POTIONS
TO TAKE US TO
THE UNDERWORLD,

29:50.789 --> 29:53.008
BUT NOTHING ON
THE NOXON.

29:53.182 --> 29:54.444
ARE YOU SCARED ABOUT
BEING HERE?

29:54.618 --> 29:56.403
THIS PLACE IS USUALLY
CRAWLING WITH DEMONS.

29:56.577 --> 29:57.752
WELL, I THINK
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US,

29:57.926 --> 29:59.406
WE HAVE ENOUGH POWER
TO DEFEND OURSELVES.

29:59.580 --> 30:02.148
BESIDES, WE CAN'T
COUNT ON ANYONE ELSE.

30:02.322 --> 30:05.020
SO, WE DON'T HAVE
ANY OTHER CHOICE, DO WE?

30:05.194 --> 30:08.894
YEAH, I GUESS, BUT IT'S
STILL KINDA CREEPY.

30:10.939 --> 30:12.375
[TELEPATHICALLY]
DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS?

30:12.549 --> 30:13.507
[TELEPATHICALLY]
NO, BUT I'M AFRAID
THE CHARMED ONES

30:13.681 --> 30:15.248
ARE CLOSE
TO FIGURING IT OUT.

30:15.422 --> 30:16.945
BUT WHAT IF THEY
FIND HIM FIRST?

30:17.119 --> 30:18.599
YOU'LL KNOW WHERE
TO FIND HIM, TOO...

30:18.773 --> 30:21.428
IF YOU USE YOUR POWERS
TO FOLLOW THEM.

30:21.602 --> 30:24.953
IT MAY BE YOUR ONLY CHANCE
TO SAVE HER FROM THEM.

30:27.651 --> 30:29.915
[SIGHS] IT'S NO USE.
THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

30:30.089 --> 30:31.003
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

30:32.569 --> 30:33.919
I WONDER...

30:34.093 --> 30:35.746
WHAT?

30:35.921 --> 30:38.793
MAYBE I CAN
LISTEN IN ON THEM,

30:38.967 --> 30:40.012
SEE IF THEY'VE
FOUND HIM YET.

30:40.186 --> 30:41.317
YOU CAN DO THAT?

30:41.491 --> 30:42.623
YEAH.

30:42.797 --> 30:45.104
I MEAN, IF IT'S OK WITH YOU.

30:45.278 --> 30:46.453
YEAH. WHY NOT?

30:49.586 --> 30:51.850
Piper, Phoebe, Henry:
ANCIENT POWERS,
WE SUMMON THEE.

AND SEEK YOUR HELP
IN FINDING

30:55.549 --> 30:58.334

30:58.508 --> 30:59.770
NOTHING.

30:59.945 --> 31:01.816
I'M SORRY, GUYS.
I THINK IT'S MY FAULT.

31:01.990 --> 31:03.470
Paige: MAYBE I SHOULD TRY
SAYING IT AGAIN.

31:03.644 --> 31:06.299
UH, PAIGE THINKS THAT
MAYBE SHE SHOULD TRY--

31:06.473 --> 31:08.605
FORGET IT. WE NEED
TO GET HER...OUT OF THERE.

31:08.779 --> 31:10.477
CALL HIM.

31:10.651 --> 31:12.696
DO I HAVE TO?

31:12.871 --> 31:14.481
OK.

31:15.917 --> 31:17.832
CUPID!

31:18.006 --> 31:19.834

YOU'RE OUT THERE...

FROM THE GRASS.

31:33.152 --> 31:34.849
I'M JUST RECITING
WHAT MICHAEL WROTE.

31:35.023 --> 31:36.372
HE LEFT THIS FOR YOU
AT THE DOOR.

31:36.546 --> 31:37.591
REALLY?

31:37.765 --> 31:39.506
YEAH, NEVER MIND THAT.
WE NEED--

BREAK AT LAST."

WRITE THIS.

31:50.299 --> 31:51.518
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

31:51.692 --> 31:52.693
I WROTE IT, YOU KNOW,

31:52.867 --> 31:53.650
A COUPLE HUNDRED
YEARS AGO OR SO.

31:53.824 --> 31:55.000
SOME OF MY BEST WORK.

31:55.174 --> 31:56.784
AHEM!

31:58.090 --> 32:02.485
YEAH, OK. LISTEN,
UM, WE NEED YOUR HELP.

32:02.659 --> 32:05.488
YOU GOTTA GET PAIGE
OUT OF HENRY.

32:05.662 --> 32:08.491
UH, YEAH, BUT ARE YOU
SURE THEY'VE WORKED
THROUGH THEIR ISSUES?

32:08.665 --> 32:09.840
YES, THEY HAVE.

32:10.015 --> 32:12.191
ALL RIGHT.

32:16.499 --> 32:18.719
OH, DEAR.

32:20.155 --> 32:22.201

PROBABLY GO.

32:26.683 --> 32:29.034
OK. GOOD LUCK.

32:31.993 --> 32:32.951
WELL, YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY GO, TOO.

32:33.125 --> 32:35.344
BUT WHAT ABOUT LOVE?

32:35.518 --> 32:36.911
UGGHH! GO!

32:41.263 --> 32:43.048
I MEAN...REALLY.

32:43.222 --> 32:44.092
OH, YOU GOT TRUFFLES!

32:44.266 --> 32:46.747
YES, I DID.

AND SEEK YOUR HELP
IN FINDING

32:54.233 --> 32:56.539
THE DEMON WHO IS IN HIDING.

32:56.713 --> 32:57.932
THEY FOUND HIM.

32:58.106 --> 32:59.107
HURRY, THROW
THE POTION

32:59.281 --> 33:01.370
WHILE I'M STILL
CHANNELING THEM.

33:05.766 --> 33:07.289
OH, NO, YOU DON'T!

33:14.644 --> 33:16.472
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

33:16.646 --> 33:19.606
YOU HAVE EXACTLY
5 SECONDS TO LIVE

33:19.780 --> 33:21.912
UNLESS YOU TELL US
WHO YOU'RE
WORKING FOR.

33:22.087 --> 33:23.610
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

33:23.784 --> 33:26.091
4...
3...
2--

33:26.265 --> 33:28.093
ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!
I'LL TALK.

33:28.267 --> 33:30.182
NOT SO FAST.

33:30.356 --> 33:31.835
LEAVE HIM ALONE.
HE'S OURS.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.534
OURS? BILLIE, WE'RE ALL ON
THE SAME SIDE HERE.

33:34.708 --> 33:35.883
ARE WE?

33:36.057 --> 33:37.450
WE'RE NOT GONNA LET YOU
VANQUISH HIM.

33:37.624 --> 33:39.060
WORKS FOR ME.

33:39.234 --> 33:40.409
AND WE'RE NOT GONNA LET YOU
TAKE HIM ALIVE, EITHER.

33:40.583 --> 33:42.716
THIS IS ABSURD.

33:42.890 --> 33:44.152
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

33:44.326 --> 33:45.719
WHY ARE YOU TWISTING
WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT?

33:45.893 --> 33:46.981
SHE'S NOT TWISTING
ANYTHING.

33:47.155 --> 33:47.982
AND SHE'S THE ONE
THAT TORE ME AWAY

33:48.156 --> 33:49.244
FROM PROTECTING
MY PARENTS

33:49.418 --> 33:50.898
SO SHE WOULDN'T
BOTHER THE 2 OF YOU.

33:51.072 --> 33:53.640
BILLIE, I SWEAR IF I KNEW
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN--

33:53.814 --> 33:56.295
YOU WOULD HAVE USED ME
THE SAME WAY TO GET
WHAT YOU WANTED.

33:56.469 --> 33:58.949
AND I'M SICK
OF BEING USED.

33:59.124 --> 34:00.081
MMM!

34:00.255 --> 34:02.562
[GROANING]

34:02.736 --> 34:03.998
NO!

34:04.172 --> 34:05.391
[TELEPATHICALLY]
WE DON'T NEED THE POTION.

34:05.565 --> 34:06.696
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

34:06.870 --> 34:09.134
YOU CAN USE YOUR POWER
TO AMPLIFY MINE.

34:09.308 --> 34:10.222
UH, WHAT'S GOING ON?

34:19.361 --> 34:22.234
[SCREAMING]

34:24.584 --> 34:25.933
[GASPS]

34:32.200 --> 34:33.506
[GRUNTING]

34:36.161 --> 34:37.901
OK.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.773
DID THEY JUST VANQUISH
A DEMON THAT CAN'T
BE VANQUISHED?

34:39.947 --> 34:41.427
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

34:41.601 --> 34:44.343
I THINK THAT MEANS WE JUST
FOUND THE ULTIMATE POWER.

34:56.485 --> 34:58.096
HEY.

34:58.270 --> 35:00.576
HEY.

35:00.750 --> 35:01.969
TOUGH DAY AT THE OFFICE?

35:02.143 --> 35:04.189
WELL, YOU KNOW...

35:04.363 --> 35:06.626
YOU LET A YOUNG WITCH
INTO YOUR FAMILY

35:06.800 --> 35:08.889
AND TEACH HER EVERYTHING
THAT YOU KNOW,

35:09.063 --> 35:11.370
ONLY TO BE BETRAYED BY HER.

35:11.544 --> 35:13.459
YEAH, IT WAS A ROUGH DAY.

35:13.633 --> 35:16.114
I GUESS LOVE IS PRETTY LOW
ON THE LIST THEN, HUH?

35:16.288 --> 35:18.290
ACTUALLY, NO.

35:18.464 --> 35:20.814
I MEAN, IT CAN ONLY
MAKE ME STRONGER, RIGHT?

35:20.988 --> 35:22.685
YEAH.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.602
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANNA TELL YOU,

35:26.776 --> 35:29.692
BUT I'M NOT SURE IF I WILL
BE ABLE TO ARTICULATE IT WELL.

35:29.866 --> 35:31.172
ALL RIGHT.

35:35.307 --> 35:37.352
MAYBE I CAN HELP.

35:37.526 --> 35:39.702
NO, ACTUALLY, IT'S SOMETHING
THAT I HAVE TO SAY...

35:39.876 --> 35:41.574
AND THAT YOU HAVE TO HEAR.

35:41.748 --> 35:45.491
UH, I'VE BEEN HAVING
THESE FEELINGS,

35:45.665 --> 35:48.581
THESE REALLY
INTENSE FEELINGS

35:48.755 --> 35:50.844
THAT I HAVEN'T HAD FOR
A REALLY LONG TIME.

35:51.018 --> 35:52.454
AND IT'S...

35:52.628 --> 35:54.239
IT'S SCARY.

35:54.413 --> 35:58.286
MOSTLY BECAUSE THE PERSON THAT
I'M HAVING THESE FEELINGS FOR

35:58.460 --> 35:59.853
IS SO UNEXPECTED.

36:02.377 --> 36:04.684
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT CAN WORK.

36:06.251 --> 36:07.861
BUT...

36:08.035 --> 36:09.863
YOU GOTTA FOLLOW
YOUR HEART, RIGHT?

36:12.039 --> 36:15.173
WELL...

36:15.347 --> 36:16.913
YOU TELL ME.

36:17.087 --> 36:21.222
GOD, IT HAS GOT TO SUCK
TO BE CUPID!

36:21.396 --> 36:24.443
YOU KNOW, NEVER FINDING
A LOVE OF YOUR OWN?

36:24.617 --> 36:27.489
IT'S GOTTA BE
SO HARD FOR YOU.

36:27.663 --> 36:28.925
I'M SORRY...

36:29.099 --> 36:30.492
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE OF
ALL THE RULES AND STUFF.

36:30.666 --> 36:34.235
IT'S JUST--I WOULD THINK
IT'S GOTTA BE REALLY HARD.

36:34.409 --> 36:37.673
SO, UM--SO YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT
YOU AND, UH...

36:37.847 --> 36:39.240
MICHAEL.

36:39.414 --> 36:41.982
YEAH. YEAH. WHO ELSE WOULD
I BE TALKING ABOUT?

36:42.156 --> 36:44.245
NO. NO, UM...

36:44.419 --> 36:47.205
YOU JUST MADE IT SOUND LIKE
IT WAS SOMEONE...

36:47.379 --> 36:49.032
UNEXPECTED.

36:49.207 --> 36:52.166
WELL, YEAH. YOU KNOW,
I DON'T WANNA BE
WITH ANYONE MAGICAL

36:52.340 --> 36:55.865
JUST BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING THAT
I'VE GONE THROUGH IN MY LIFE.

36:56.039 --> 36:57.389
WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND?

36:57.563 --> 37:00.392
I THINK...

37:00.566 --> 37:03.873
MAYBE WATCHING WHAT PAIGE
AND HENRY ARE GOING THROUGH

37:04.047 --> 37:05.788
AND HOW THEY'RE
MAKING IT WORK AND...

37:05.962 --> 37:09.749
HONESTLY...YOU.

37:09.923 --> 37:13.187
I MEAN, YOU KNEW.

37:13.361 --> 37:14.884
YOU HAD TO HEAR THE THINGS
THAT HE WAS SAYING TO ME...

37:15.058 --> 37:16.190
ON THE BALCONY--

37:16.364 --> 37:18.627
THEY WERE JUST...
SO SWEET.

37:18.801 --> 37:21.239
ACTUALLY...

37:24.677 --> 37:28.463
YEAH. I ALWAYS KNEW
HE HAD IT IN HIM.

37:28.637 --> 37:30.813
I GUESS THAT'S WHY
YOU PICKED HIM FOR ME, HUH?

37:32.250 --> 37:33.816
YEP.

37:33.990 --> 37:36.428
SURE IS.

37:36.602 --> 37:38.778
SO I GUESS MY WORK
HERE IS DONE.

37:38.952 --> 37:40.170
I GUESS I BETTER
GET GOING.

37:49.789 --> 37:51.791
THANK YOU...

37:51.965 --> 37:53.706
FOR EVERYTHING
YOU'VE DONE FOR ME.

37:53.880 --> 37:57.449
NO, IT WAS MY PLEASURE.

38:01.191 --> 38:02.192
GOOD LUCK, HUH?

38:02.367 --> 38:03.977
BYE.

38:41.667 --> 38:43.625
HEY.

38:43.799 --> 38:44.713
IT'S GONNA BE OK,
YOU KNOW.

38:44.887 --> 38:48.935
OH, YEAH?
I'M NOT SO SURE.

38:49.109 --> 38:51.372
IT WAS RIGHT THERE
IN FRONT OF US THE ENTIRE TIME

38:51.546 --> 38:52.634
AND WE DIDN'T SEE IT.

38:52.808 --> 38:54.680
HOW WERE WE SUPPOSED
TO SEE IT?

38:54.854 --> 38:56.856
IT'S BILLIE.
SHE'S ONE OF US.

38:57.030 --> 39:01.164
STILL, WITH CHRISTY
AND THEIR POWERS, THE TRIAD...

39:01.339 --> 39:02.992
WE JUST MISSED IT.

39:03.166 --> 39:04.690
AND NOW I HOPE
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

39:07.127 --> 39:11.174
NOT TOO LATE
FOR WHAT EXACTLY?

39:11.349 --> 39:12.872
TO STOP THEM.

39:13.046 --> 39:15.614
NO. NO, PIPER.

39:15.788 --> 39:17.050
YOU CAN'T VANQUISH THEM.

39:17.224 --> 39:18.443
THEY'RE NOT DEMONS.
THEY'RE PEOPLE.

39:21.010 --> 39:23.404
PEOPLE THE TRIAD TARGETED
TO TAKE US OUT.

39:23.578 --> 39:24.623
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
FOR SURE.

39:24.797 --> 39:25.798
DON'T I?
THINK ABOUT IT.

39:25.972 --> 39:27.365
IT MAKES COMPLETE SENSE.

39:27.539 --> 39:28.931
I CAN'T GIVE UP
ON BILLIE.

39:29.105 --> 39:30.716
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP
ON BILLIE. NOT YET.

39:30.890 --> 39:33.283
OK? SHE'S BEEN THROUGH
SO MUCH--THEY BOTH HAVE.

39:33.458 --> 39:35.242
MAYBE THEY'LL
COME AROUND.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.593
I HAVE TO GO.

39:38.767 --> 39:41.422
HENRY'S WAITING FOR ME.

39:41.596 --> 39:44.817
LOOK, WE'RE GONNA...
FIGURE THIS OUT, OK?

39:44.991 --> 39:45.818
IT'S WHAT WE DO.

39:45.992 --> 39:48.037
WE'D BETTER.

40:03.531 --> 40:07.753
IT'S JUST
YOU AND ME NOW, SIS.

40:07.927 --> 40:10.451
AND IT ALWAYS WILL BE.
