<i>(narrator) YOU'RE TRA VEL ING'
THROUGH ANOTHER DIMENSION.</i>

00:12.930 --> 00:16.172
<i>A DIMENSION NOT ONLY OF SIGHT
AND SOUND BUT OF MIND</i>

00:16.225 --> 00:17.966
<i>A JOURNEY
INTO A WONDROUS LAND</i>

00:18.060 --> 00:20.392
<i>WHOSE BOUNDARIES
ARE THAT OF IMAGINATION.</i>

00:20.479 --> 00:23.346
<i>YOUR NEXT STOP,
THE TWILIGHT</i> ZONE.

00:26.735 --> 00:29.773
TONIGHT'S STORY ON THE
TI/V/L/GHTZONE IS SOMEVVHAT UNIQUE

00:29.863 --> 00:32.695
AND CALLS FORA DIFFERENT
KIND OF INTRODUCTION.

00:32.783 --> 00:35.866
THIS, AS YOU MAY RECOGNIZE,
IS A MAP OF THE UNITED STATES

00:35.953 --> 00:38.570
AND THERE'S A LITTLE TOVVN
THERE CALLED PEAKSVILLE.

00:38.664 --> 00:40.826
ON A GIVEN MORNING
NOT TOO LONG AGO

00:40.916 --> 00:42.702
THE REST
OF THE WORLD DISAPPEARED

00:42.793 --> 00:44.875
AND PEAKSVILLE
WAS LEFT ALL ALONE.

00:44.962 --> 00:48.250
ITS INHABITANTS VVERE NEVER SURE
VVHETHER THE VVORLD VVAS DESTROYED

00:48.340 --> 00:50.206
AND ONLY PEAKSVILLE
LEFT UNTOUCHED,

00:50.300 --> 00:52.382
OR IF THE VILLAGE
HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY.

00:52.469 --> 00:55.507
<i>THEY WERE, ON THE OTHER HAND,
SURE OF ONE THING. THE CAUSE.</i>

00:55.597 --> 00:57.679
<i>A MONSTER HAD ARRIVED
IN THE VILLAGE.</i>

00:57.766 --> 01:00.929
<i>JUST BY USING HIS MIND,
HE TOOK AWAY THE AUTOMOBILES,</i>

01:01.019 --> 01:04.727
<i>THE ELECTRICITY, THE MACHINES,
BECAUSE THEY DISPLEASED HIM.</i>

01:04.815 --> 01:06.647
<i>AND HE MOVED
AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY</i>

01:06.733 --> 01:10.101
<i>BACK INTO THE DARK AGES
JUST BY USING HIS MIND.</i>

01:10.195 --> 01:11.777
NOW I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU

01:11.863 --> 01:14.070
TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE
IN PEAKSVILLE, OHIO.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.114
<i>THIS IS MR. FREMONT.</i>

01:16.201 --> 01:19.193
<i>IT'S IN HIS FARMHOUSE
THAT THE MONSTER RESIDES.</i>

01:19.288 --> 01:21.529
<i>THIS IS MRS. FREMONT.</i>

01:21.623 --> 01:24.331
<i>AND THIS IS AUNT AMY,
WHO PROBABLY HAD MORE CONTROL</i>

01:24.418 --> 01:27.080
<i>OVER THE MONSTER IN THE
BEGINNING THAN ALMOST ANYONE.</i>

01:27.170 --> 01:28.422
<i>BUT ONE DAY SHE FORGOT.</i>

01:28.505 --> 01:30.212
<i>SHE BEGAN TO SING ALOUD.</i>

01:30.299 --> 01:32.415
<i>NOW, THE MONSTER
DOESN'T LIKE SINGING</i>

01:32.509 --> 01:34.500
<i>SO HIS MIND SNAPPED AT HER,</i>

01:34.595 --> 01:36.962
<i>AND TURNED HER INTO THIS
SMILING, VACANT THING</i>

01:37.055 --> 01:38.341
<i>YOU'RE LOOKING AT NOW.</i>

01:38.432 --> 01:40.173
<i>SHE SINGS NO MORE.</i>

01:40.267 --> 01:42.508
<i>AND YOU'LL NOTE
THAT THE PEOPLE</i>

01:42.603 --> 01:44.844
<i>IN PEAKSVILLE, OHIO
HAVE TO SMILE.</i>

01:44.938 --> 01:48.226
<i>THEY HAVE TO THINK HAPPY
THOUGHTS AND SAY HAPPY THINGS</i>

01:48.317 --> 01:51.025
<i>BECAUSE ONCE DISPLEASED,
THE MONSTER CAN WISH THEM</i>

01:51.111 --> 01:52.852
<i>INTO A CORNFIELD
OR CHANGE THEM</i>

01:52.946 --> 01:55.324
<i>INTO A GROTESQUE,
WALKING HORROR.</i>

01:55.407 --> 01:58.365
<i>THIS PARTICULAR MONSTER
CAN READ MINDS, YOU SEE.</i>

01:58.452 --> 02:02.036
<i>HE KNOWS EVERY THOUGHT,
HE CAN FEEL EVERY EMOTION.</i>

02:02.122 --> 02:05.114
OH, YES, I DID FORGET
SOMETHING, DIDN'T I?

02:05.208 --> 02:07.586
I FORGOT TO INTRODUOE
YOU TO THE MONSTER.

<i>BUT WHEN THOSE EYES
LOOK AT YOU,</i>

02:18.347 --> 02:20.634
<i>YOU'D BETTER START THINKING
HAPPY THOUGHTS</i>

02:20.724 --> 02:24.217
<i>BECAUSE THE MIND BEHIND THEM
IS ABSOLUTELY IN CHARGE.</i>

OH, I WOULDN'T
SAY THAT, AUNT AMY.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.522
NO, SIR, I WOULDN'T
SAY THAT AT ALL.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.611

03:47.728 --> 03:49.059
I'LL MAKE HIM DEAD NOW.

03:49.146 --> 03:51.308
I'M TIRED
OF PLAYING WITH HIM.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.638

LAUNDRY SOAP, THOUGH.

04:33.023 --> 04:34.309

MATTER OF FACT, I'LL
TELL HIM RIGHT NOW.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.056

YESTERDAY HE MADE ONE--

05:36.503 --> 05:39.211
I NEVER DID SEE
THE LIKES OF IT.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.584
HE INVENTED IT
ALL BY HIMSELF.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.757
IT HAD REAL
SHARP TEETH.

05:43.844 --> 05:47.428
