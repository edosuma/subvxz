00:48.388 --> 00:50.590
Hey! How was it? How'd it go?

00:50.790 --> 00:52.126
Dr. Cyper is amazing.

00:52.226 --> 00:55.295
You'd think he was cutting the crusts
off his kid's sandwich.

00:55.395 --> 00:57.918
So you really want to leave
all of this for that?

00:58.018 --> 01:01.669
If I qualify for this transfer
I'll still... Is this yours?

01:01.769 --> 01:05.872
- Oh, yeah, sorry.
- I will still be "all this" adjacent.

01:05.972 --> 01:08.408
I don't know why you want
to be a surgical nurse.

01:08.508 --> 01:11.876
You know, I can take my kids barfing on me,
I can take the patients whizzing on me,

01:11.976 --> 01:16.349
but the minute you pull out
a scalpel... I'm like... gross!

01:17.317 --> 01:19.053
Yeah, it can be awfully revolting.

01:20.854 --> 01:23.290
Did Mrs. Disantos die?

01:37.571 --> 01:40.040
Tony, I'm so sorry about your mother.

01:41.708 --> 01:45.078
You were always so good
to come and stay with her.

01:46.980 --> 01:50.817
I hope it's some comfort
that she didn't suffer much.

01:52.079 --> 01:53.785
No.

01:55.122 --> 01:57.791
No. There's no comfort at all.

01:58.391 --> 02:02.262
I wish she had suffered good and long.

02:02.362 --> 02:06.393
Yeah, I wish she had to lay
in that bed for 29 years

02:06.493 --> 02:08.608
and listen to me tell her how...

02:08.708 --> 02:10.691
ugly...

02:10.791 --> 02:12.900
stupid...

02:13.000 --> 02:15.481
and lazy she is.

02:16.109 --> 02:18.645
Yeah, I'm not going to the store
to get your pills.

02:18.745 --> 02:22.749
I'm not rubbing the cramps
out of your legs.

02:22.849 --> 02:27.521
I'm not putting gas
in your fucking car anymore.

02:28.655 --> 02:32.058
Holy crap! I mean, for five months?

02:32.158 --> 02:34.328
He reads her the newspaper,
he brushes her hair,

02:34.428 --> 02:36.463
he brings her azaleas from her garden?

02:36.563 --> 02:38.232
I thought he loved his mother,
didn't you?

02:38.332 --> 02:40.518
- I thought he was 45!
- Shut up!

02:40.618 --> 02:44.071
- He fooled us both. He's 29?
- Twenty-nine?

02:44.171 --> 02:48.258
Hey, wait! I heard that you were
going out on some kind of blind date.

02:48.358 --> 02:50.126
I mean, really,
you're keeping that from me?

02:50.226 --> 02:51.411
It's nothing, really.

02:51.511 --> 02:54.481
A decompressive craniectomy
is nothing, really.

02:54.581 --> 02:58.168
Compared to this. It is big news!
And I feel a little left out.

02:58.418 --> 03:00.587
Well, Nancy, the way big news
travels around here

03:00.687 --> 03:03.323
I'm sure you'll hear all about it.

03:05.125 --> 03:08.295
You sure have a lot of holes
in your face.

03:08.695 --> 03:10.197
I have holes all over.

03:10.297 --> 03:12.432
Nice. Any more down there?

03:12.532 --> 03:13.867
Excuse me.

03:14.167 --> 03:15.602
Would you mind?

03:34.747 --> 03:36.456
Dammit.

03:38.024 --> 03:40.260
You can use one of those.

03:41.528 --> 03:44.131
No, that's okay.
I'll just wait 'til later.

03:44.964 --> 03:46.767
Well...

03:47.067 --> 03:49.469
You have to sign the receipt.

04:10.356 --> 04:12.192
Okay.

04:15.295 --> 04:17.329
Thank you.

04:21.721 --> 04:23.603
Daddy?

04:36.850 --> 04:38.719
Daddy?

05:02.375 --> 05:04.077
Get off me, you stupid dog!

05:04.177 --> 05:06.545
Benny, come here! Come!

05:07.680 --> 05:11.771
- Did he get you?
- Yeah, he tore my dress. Stupid dog.

05:11.871 --> 05:15.104
Well, he's not stupid,
he's just being protective, that's all.

05:15.204 --> 05:18.893
- I'm your daughter.
- You're a stranger to him, is all.

05:22.529 --> 05:24.664
Come on, Benny.

05:25.332 --> 05:27.968
You know, Miranda, I've been thinking.

05:28.085 --> 05:32.105
I really should go with you tomorrow.
Go down and look at that house.

05:32.205 --> 05:34.974
Oh, yeah, look at it
or try to talk me out of it?

05:35.074 --> 05:40.480
Come on. I know better
than to try to talk you out of it.

05:40.580 --> 05:43.283
But these realtors are kind
of slick, you know.

05:43.383 --> 05:45.518
They'd do anything to make a sale.

05:45.618 --> 05:48.021
So you've got to check
the heating system.

05:48.121 --> 05:51.190
And the foundations, and the roof.

05:51.290 --> 05:53.962
- Yeah.
- And...

05:55.195 --> 05:59.299
Oh, I'm sorry about Benny.
There's a trick to him. Bribery.

05:59.399 --> 06:02.869
Get him some meat
and he'll be your friend forever.

06:04.070 --> 06:06.073
Hello!

06:07.674 --> 06:09.476
Miranda.

06:10.109 --> 06:11.779
I want him to stop bothering me.

06:15.281 --> 06:18.885
- It's so good to see you, Karen.
- Same here.

06:22.288 --> 06:25.325
You owe me a dress, dog.

06:31.581 --> 06:33.950
Miranda, somebody's choking.

06:35.535 --> 06:36.803
Sorry.

06:37.023 --> 06:39.205
No one can get their arms around him.

06:39.305 --> 06:42.509
Okay. Okay, sir.
The Heimlich maneuver isn't working.

06:42.609 --> 06:45.278
Just... I'm gonna help you.
I'm gonna help you.

06:45.378 --> 06:46.947
I'm gonna help you breathe.

06:47.547 --> 06:51.050
Someone give me a steak knife.
It's okay, sir.

06:52.986 --> 06:55.355
I'm gonna help you breathe.

06:57.790 --> 07:00.460
I need a straw. I need a straw.

07:11.304 --> 07:12.700
It's gonna be okay.

07:16.242 --> 07:19.112
Hold my hand squeeze tight.
Squeeze all you want. Okay.

07:19.212 --> 07:21.848
Okay, there you go, there you go.

07:21.948 --> 07:23.783
- Someone call 911?
- Yeah, we did.

07:23.883 --> 07:26.118
Okay, they're on their way.

07:26.886 --> 07:28.838
You're gonna be okay.

07:28.938 --> 07:33.094
So, marble in the entryway,
sunken living room, and...

07:35.194 --> 07:37.630
granite countertops.

07:37.730 --> 07:39.666
Throughout.

07:39.766 --> 07:43.603
Stainless steel appliances, and...

07:43.970 --> 07:45.538
double ovens.

07:45.638 --> 07:49.909
- I love double wall ovens.
- I love them too!

07:55.081 --> 07:58.851
- Let's have a look at that water heater.
- Yes, let's.

08:41.394 --> 08:43.697
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

08:43.797 --> 08:47.600
- Miranda! What did you do?
- I said I'd bring the cake.

08:47.700 --> 08:50.137
- It's so beautiful!
- You made this?

08:50.237 --> 08:52.071
It's just something I do.

08:52.171 --> 08:55.742
Oh, my God. It's so perfect,
I don't want to ruin it.

08:55.842 --> 08:58.382
- Oh, come on. That's nonsense, Nancy.
- That's what it's for.

08:58.482 --> 09:01.696
- All right. Here we go.
- No, no, Nancy, Nancy.

09:01.796 --> 09:03.700
- What?
- It's got mustard on it.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.419
- I brought this, use this.
- Okay.

09:06.519 --> 09:08.988
Wait, wait, wait. There are no candles.

09:09.088 --> 09:11.040
It's not a birthday cake
if there are no candles.

09:11.140 --> 09:15.262
- Yes, it is.
- All right, I'll settle this. Watch this.

09:27.106 --> 09:29.341
What a way to eat this.

09:31.678 --> 09:33.480
It's the salt and the sweet.

09:33.580 --> 09:35.815
- It's so good!
- Nancy is so drunk.

09:36.215 --> 09:38.985
- So when's the big night?
- The big night?

09:39.085 --> 09:42.892
- With Kevin.
- Kevin. The big night is...

09:42.992 --> 09:45.731
- You didn't cancel.
- No, I didn't cancel.

09:46.092 --> 09:48.661
Just promise me
that you won't stand him up.

09:48.761 --> 09:52.532
- He works with my husband.
- I... why... why would I do that?

09:52.732 --> 09:55.785
Well, it took me a good six months
to get you to say yes.

09:55.885 --> 09:59.388
- I just really want it to go well.
- I don't know why you care so much.

09:59.538 --> 10:02.208
If it goes great
then you can say that...

10:02.308 --> 10:05.311
you found your soulmate
because of Darlene.

10:37.243 --> 10:38.745
Kevin?

10:39.412 --> 10:41.314
You didn't knock.

10:41.414 --> 10:43.483
- I was...
- You're early.

10:43.650 --> 10:45.918
That's why I didn't knock.

10:46.018 --> 10:47.087
I'm sorry.

10:48.421 --> 10:52.825
There are worse things,
I suppose, like... being late.

10:55.895 --> 10:57.864
Yes, they're here!

10:57.964 --> 11:00.332
Oh, let me get that for you.

11:01.467 --> 11:02.569
Thank you.

11:06.505 --> 11:08.708
Where do you want it?

11:14.046 --> 11:15.448
- Over here?
- That's fine.

11:15.548 --> 11:18.150
All right,
I'll just set that right there.

11:20.753 --> 11:23.476
- Did you cut yourself?
- No.

11:23.576 --> 11:26.859
Oh, no, that's nail polish.

11:30.763 --> 11:35.068
I should put some clothes on.
Would you excuse me?

11:35.168 --> 11:37.837
Okay. Sure.

11:37.937 --> 11:40.173
Oh, I should've offered you
something to drink.

11:40.273 --> 11:42.345
I have fresh squeezed lemonade.

11:42.445 --> 11:45.031
Do I have to pay 50 cents
and drink it out of a little paper cup?

11:45.131 --> 11:47.614
No, I closed the stand.

11:47.714 --> 11:49.849
Bought a little bicycle
with the money I made.

11:49.949 --> 11:53.420
- A little basket on the front?
- With tassels for the handlebars.

11:56.539 --> 12:00.343
- So do you want the lemonade?
- No thank you, I'm good.

12:14.573 --> 12:16.509
You moving?

12:17.977 --> 12:19.779
What?

12:21.948 --> 12:25.652
I was just asking, are you...

12:25.752 --> 12:27.186
are you moving?

12:27.286 --> 12:30.505
Yeah. As soon as I sell this place.

12:32.124 --> 12:34.093
What, you don't like it here?

12:34.794 --> 12:39.265
Liking one place doesn't mean
you can't move to another one, so...

12:40.466 --> 12:45.471
I don't know, the question of whether
I like it here or not is really moot.

12:47.486 --> 12:49.275
Sorry.

12:56.549 --> 12:58.618
You look hot.

13:00.353 --> 13:03.990
- Did you say something?
- I was just saying you look really nice.

13:05.107 --> 13:07.309
Thank you, Kevin.

13:08.160 --> 13:12.165
I ordered these a few days ago,
and I have been dying to get them.

13:37.390 --> 13:40.192
Must be an awfully special pen?

13:43.029 --> 13:45.030
Would you mind?

13:47.233 --> 13:49.001
Thank you.

13:51.738 --> 13:54.573
You know, I should finish getting ready.

13:55.274 --> 13:57.710
- Could you come back?
- Come back?

13:58.845 --> 14:02.081
- Well, you are early.
- What time was I supposed to be here?

14:02.181 --> 14:04.183
You don't remember?

14:04.583 --> 14:07.186
- It's just...
- Kevin.

14:08.020 --> 14:09.755
Come on.

14:11.658 --> 14:14.159
I really don't want to leave.

14:17.596 --> 14:21.133
I think it's best that you do.
I'm sorry.

14:25.271 --> 14:26.930
Okay.

14:35.982 --> 14:37.550
Why'd you do that?

14:38.050 --> 14:39.519
Unlock my door.

14:39.819 --> 14:43.089
Okay, you need to leave, like, right now,
or I'm calling the police.

14:43.489 --> 14:47.159
You're not calling anybody. Okay?

14:47.259 --> 14:50.329
- Don't you touch me.
- It's okay.

14:50.746 --> 14:54.166
Hey, hey! Miranda,
I don't want to hurt you!

14:54.266 --> 14:56.148
I won't hurt you!

14:57.331 --> 15:00.039
Hey! Hey!

15:02.207 --> 15:04.543
- Hey, come here.
- Stop it, you fuck!

15:04.643 --> 15:06.812
Hey, stop!

15:07.980 --> 15:09.782
I want you.

15:09.882 --> 15:12.918
I've always wanted you.

15:18.791 --> 15:22.194
- Hey!
- Get the fuck off me!

15:34.773 --> 15:36.547
Stop!

15:40.851 --> 15:44.751
It's gonna be okay. I already said
I don't want to hurt you, okay?

15:44.851 --> 15:46.986
I don't want to hurt you.

15:50.089 --> 15:52.158
No!

16:00.566 --> 16:02.802
That feel good?

16:09.041 --> 16:12.344
Are you okay? You okay?

16:17.617 --> 16:19.452
You okay?

16:33.399 --> 16:35.067
Hello?

16:38.404 --> 16:40.206
Miranda?

16:47.780 --> 16:49.030
Anybody home?

16:53.852 --> 16:55.688
Miranda?

16:56.989 --> 16:59.291
Should I wait here?

17:02.895 --> 17:05.396
Darlene said you might cancel.

17:28.421 --> 17:32.425
I just... I showed up, and she was...

17:33.559 --> 17:37.997
God, I had never even met her before.
It was a blind date.

17:38.297 --> 17:41.400
Oh, God. I've... I've...

17:41.500 --> 17:44.036
I've never seen anyone like that.

17:44.136 --> 17:47.272
Will she... will she be okay?

18:46.031 --> 18:48.434
The man who raped you...

18:48.534 --> 18:50.795
have you seen him before?

18:57.343 --> 18:59.178
Yes.

19:00.078 --> 19:01.980
- Sorry.
- Oh, hey, William.

19:02.080 --> 19:03.365
Hey, Deacon around?

19:03.465 --> 19:06.152
He's in the office, but no one's
been able to get him off the phone.

19:06.252 --> 19:10.697
- I thought you were off tonight, man?
- I just need my money, that's all.

19:13.058 --> 19:16.328
Oh, hey, Deacon. I was hoping I could...

19:25.404 --> 19:28.641
Here's that show
you used to like to watch.

19:39.618 --> 19:43.689
Honey, I'm gonna get something
to drink, okay?

19:43.789 --> 19:47.626
I'll be right back. Right back.

22:50.642 --> 22:54.492
So what you're saying is I have...
I have no buyer.

22:55.448 --> 22:59.952
Now, Miranda, listen, I know
that you are having a very hard time.

23:00.052 --> 23:03.756
So, I can't proceed
on the other house now.

23:04.156 --> 23:07.993
- But you like that house.
- But I wanted a new one.

23:08.093 --> 23:12.064
And now I can't sell my house,
so I can't buy a new one.

23:12.164 --> 23:14.500
I'm just stuck, I have to deal, right?

23:15.400 --> 23:17.882
Well, I'll tell you what,
we can try again in a few months?

23:17.982 --> 23:23.509
A few months? Why? I mean, why bother?
Will I suddenly be un-raped then?

23:31.850 --> 23:34.052
I have an idea.

23:34.670 --> 23:38.857
Rose bushes.
Why don't you plant rose bushes?

23:46.098 --> 23:48.967
- You need some help?
- Oh, Daddy.

23:49.067 --> 23:52.905
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing there?

23:58.910 --> 24:01.647
You know, you have your mother's nose,
and not much else.

24:01.747 --> 24:05.020
Well, that's what happens
when you give me seed packets

24:05.120 --> 24:06.985
instead of selling my damn house.

24:07.085 --> 24:09.822
Are you sure they're gonna grow
just covered up like that?

24:10.422 --> 24:13.792
You are standing on property
nobody wants.

24:13.892 --> 24:16.278
Or so says Judy, with the bad haircut.

24:16.378 --> 24:18.780
No luck I take it.

24:19.331 --> 24:21.166
Well...

24:27.506 --> 24:31.677
The reason I came over was I thought
maybe we'd go have a bite to eat.

24:31.777 --> 24:33.695
Go to the movies?

24:34.296 --> 24:37.700
- Well, you could've called.
- Well, I did, I tried.

24:47.859 --> 24:49.895
Maybe tomorrow.

24:58.070 --> 25:00.806
How's my favorite sister?

26:15.781 --> 26:17.783
Hey, Miranda!

26:18.183 --> 26:19.851
Nancy, my shift is over.

26:19.951 --> 26:23.255
I know, I know, but...
I need you, it's...

26:23.355 --> 26:24.590
It's an emergency.

26:26.024 --> 26:29.228
Miranda! Come on!

26:31.396 --> 26:35.100
It's only gonna take a second
and it's very important.

26:35.200 --> 26:39.051
We just wanted to give you a little something
before you make your transfer.

26:39.151 --> 26:41.357
We're gonna miss you so much!

26:41.457 --> 26:43.539
Surprise!

26:44.175 --> 26:49.248
- Who wrapped that?
- I did. It's just something I do.

26:49.448 --> 26:51.997
- You made this bow? It's beautiful!
- Super pretty.

26:52.097 --> 26:54.586
Thank you, guys. Thanks.

27:02.574 --> 27:04.743
- Yay!
- Ta-da!

27:04.843 --> 27:08.213
See, now you can just practice
at home. Isn't it great?

27:08.313 --> 27:09.700
Fantastic.

28:07.405 --> 28:09.474
Asshole!

28:11.910 --> 28:13.879
- Miranda.
- Oh, Mrs. Brown.

28:13.979 --> 28:16.498
- Can I speak with you?
- Oh, sure.

28:16.598 --> 28:19.185
- You missed your orientation.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

28:19.285 --> 28:22.983
Sorry doesn't cut it in surgery, Miranda.
Lives are on the line.

28:23.083 --> 28:25.302
- I know.
- Is something wrong?

28:25.402 --> 28:27.726
- No.
- You seem distracted.

28:27.826 --> 28:30.245
Which is not a good thing
in this business.

28:30.345 --> 28:32.614
Actually I'm reconsidering my transfer.

28:32.714 --> 28:36.435
After that last performance
we've already reconsidered it for you.

28:37.569 --> 28:40.556
- Oh, well...
- I'm disappointed, Miranda.

28:40.656 --> 28:45.645
You pushed very hard and very long for
something you appeared to want very badly.

28:47.078 --> 28:49.347
If it were me...

28:49.447 --> 28:52.651
I wouldn't let anything stand in my way.

28:53.735 --> 28:57.439
If it were me I wouldn't walk around
with my tag sticking out.

28:58.189 --> 29:00.959
Here you go, come again.

29:07.966 --> 29:10.436
- Lady, pay attention.
- What?

29:10.536 --> 29:13.171
I'm just telling you to pay attention.
I'm in a hurry here.

29:13.271 --> 29:15.073
Sorry.

29:25.550 --> 29:27.419
What's that?

29:28.079 --> 29:29.984
It's your stuff.

29:31.656 --> 29:33.258
Yeah, thanks.

29:33.358 --> 29:36.762
- Excuse me, you need to pay.
- I paid when I dropped it off.

29:36.862 --> 29:40.265
- I don't have any record of it.
- Well, I have a receipt right here.

29:40.365 --> 29:43.301
Well, I don't know how you can
if I don't have a record of it here.

29:43.401 --> 29:45.904
Give me a minute and I'll show you.

29:46.004 --> 29:48.173
How about you hand me
the items back first, ma'am?

29:48.273 --> 29:51.810
- Excuse me? Are you kidding?
- Lady, I need to leave.

29:51.910 --> 29:56.081
Look, I know I have a receipt.
I even... I wrote it in my check register.

29:56.181 --> 29:58.587
Okay, why don't you let me
wait on him while you're looking?

29:58.687 --> 30:00.252
Because it's my turn, dammit.

30:00.352 --> 30:02.903
Please calm down. All you need
to do is hand me the item and...

30:03.003 --> 30:06.391
And all you need to do
is stuff that fat back in your skirt.

30:06.491 --> 30:10.595
How do you manage that,
being skinny and fat at the same time?

30:11.529 --> 30:14.599
And you know, with breasts like that...

30:14.699 --> 30:16.584
do us all a favor
and wear a fucking bra.

30:16.684 --> 30:18.671
I think you need to leave.
Like right now.

30:18.771 --> 30:21.239
- Not without my tablecloth.
- Take it.

30:21.339 --> 30:24.922
No. I'm gonna find that receipt,
because I'm not having anyone in this shop

30:25.022 --> 30:26.880
thinking that I didn't pay.

30:27.880 --> 30:30.941
We have an abusive customer down here.

30:33.301 --> 30:34.469
Paid.

30:34.569 --> 30:37.389
We appreciate your business, ma'am,
but I think it's best if you leave.

30:37.489 --> 30:39.524
I bet you do.

33:44.476 --> 33:47.278
You look happy.
Is Mrs. Burke doing better?

33:47.378 --> 33:49.914
No, she's about the same.

33:52.918 --> 33:56.187
- You need help with that?
- Oh, no, I got it.

33:56.287 --> 34:00.859
You're lucky you never smoked.
It's a hard habit to give up.

34:03.661 --> 34:05.596
Yeah, well...

34:06.464 --> 34:11.069
Now I have to watch our for snacking
as a replacement for cigarettes.

34:19.226 --> 34:20.962
Damn you.

35:51.769 --> 35:53.938
This won't do.

35:54.038 --> 35:57.477
No, this won't do at all.

36:18.229 --> 36:21.567
There you go. It's looking good.

36:28.072 --> 36:32.577
- Daddy, what are you doing?
- Well, I thought maybe you'd want this.

36:33.311 --> 36:36.848
- I want an old swing on my new porch?
- Oh, it's not an old swing.

36:36.948 --> 36:40.518
Honey, this is the one you
and your mother used to use.

36:42.587 --> 36:45.756
You really remember things
differently, don't you?

36:46.691 --> 36:49.560
Daddy, the whole point
is to make this place look new.

36:49.660 --> 36:52.230
Right, right. Well, I could paint it.

36:52.330 --> 36:54.691
- Daddy.
- And if it squeaks I can oil it.

36:54.791 --> 36:55.867
Dad.

36:57.234 --> 37:00.472
All right, I'll take it down.
Take it down.

37:01.822 --> 37:04.229
Daddy? Daddy?

37:04.742 --> 37:08.279
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

37:09.013 --> 37:11.415
- I'm fine, girl.
- I got you.

37:12.183 --> 37:14.253
- Alright.
- Okay.

37:14.719 --> 37:18.156
- I got you.
- Right, one, two, three.

37:18.456 --> 37:20.291
I got you.

37:20.792 --> 37:23.179
- Thank you.
- What have you done to my porch?

37:25.630 --> 37:29.600
Hey, hey! Sir, wait!

37:29.867 --> 37:30.879
Oh, my.

37:54.025 --> 37:56.694
Critical care unit, Nancy here.

37:57.294 --> 37:59.230
It's for you.

38:06.037 --> 38:08.238
This is Miranda.

38:11.576 --> 38:13.844
I'll be right there.

38:15.880 --> 38:18.082
Will you clean the phone?

38:23.421 --> 38:26.524
- Do you think something bit him?
- I don't know.

38:26.624 --> 38:29.026
- Something poisonous.
- Maybe.

38:29.126 --> 38:32.463
- I tried lifting him, but...
- Did you fall?

38:32.597 --> 38:34.532
A little bit.

38:34.632 --> 38:36.133
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm alright.

38:36.233 --> 38:40.305
- I'll take care of him.
- You know, he might get mad.

38:40.405 --> 38:42.734
If you want to get better, dog,
you come with me.

38:42.924 --> 38:45.076
You can't be pushy.
You have to let him come to you.

38:45.176 --> 38:46.908
That's okay, I came prepared.

38:47.311 --> 38:49.564
Hospital food!

38:50.448 --> 38:52.650
Come here, Benny.

38:52.750 --> 38:56.521
Hospital food, come here, dog.
There you go. You'll come with me.

38:56.621 --> 38:58.734
- You'll come with me, right?
- Very funny.

38:58.834 --> 39:03.494
Hospital food. Come into the car.
There you go. There you go. Good boy.

39:03.594 --> 39:05.563
Oh, boy.

40:53.471 --> 40:56.073
You wanted to see me, so...

41:02.213 --> 41:04.281
William Finn.

41:07.952 --> 41:09.554
It's you.

41:10.221 --> 41:12.851
I don't think anybody wants to be me.

41:13.624 --> 41:15.460
So yeah.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.528
That's me.

41:18.196 --> 41:20.264
You look different.

41:21.466 --> 41:24.168
I don't get to get out very much.

41:26.404 --> 41:29.106
What made you finally agree to see me?

41:30.240 --> 41:32.191
An impulse.

41:32.291 --> 41:35.346
Like every other stupid decision
I ever made.

41:41.152 --> 41:45.256
You can... you can say
what you came to say.

41:46.857 --> 41:49.293
You expect me to cry?

41:49.961 --> 41:51.696
Scream?

41:51.796 --> 41:54.065
Say dear God, why me?

41:57.200 --> 42:00.738
- Something like that.
- That's not me.

42:02.039 --> 42:05.276
- I just figured from your letter.
- My letter just said I wanted to see you,

42:05.376 --> 42:08.880
it didn't say I had any idea
what I'd do when I got here.

42:11.482 --> 42:15.653
Guess I had to be sure that I could
look you in the eye and not be afraid.

42:19.323 --> 42:21.492
You still live in that same house?

42:22.359 --> 42:23.794
Excuse me?

42:23.894 --> 42:26.697
Well, I remember you told me
you were gonna move.

42:26.797 --> 42:30.201
But your letters, the address,
it's the old house.

42:32.036 --> 42:34.371
Couldn't sell the house.

42:35.606 --> 42:39.610
So I'm making improvements,
making like a new house.

42:41.762 --> 42:43.831
I'm sorry.

42:45.349 --> 42:46.975
I'm sorry.

42:50.955 --> 42:53.558
I was so messed up back then.

42:59.663 --> 43:01.566
Will, let me ask you something.

43:04.802 --> 43:06.504
Sure, anything.

43:08.673 --> 43:10.441
How's the food in here?

43:13.177 --> 43:14.130
The food.

43:15.412 --> 43:17.415
How's the food?

43:32.063 --> 43:36.100
On time. It's almost that time.

43:39.036 --> 43:41.105
So it is.

43:53.618 --> 43:57.855
I got your favorite, there you go.
I got your favorite, here you go, Benny!

43:58.022 --> 44:00.124
Come here, there you go.

44:01.458 --> 44:05.362
Yeah, you like that. You greedy dog.

44:05.896 --> 44:07.631
Daddy!

44:08.299 --> 44:12.603
I hated putting him in here, you know,
but it's just safer that way.

44:12.703 --> 44:14.404
I thought you were
at the hardware store.

44:14.504 --> 44:17.312
I was, but they didn't need me anymore.

44:17.412 --> 44:22.179
- And you came over not to see me?
- Actually I came by to check on the dog.

44:23.097 --> 44:25.299
I thought you guys were sworn enemies.

44:25.399 --> 44:28.869
The way I see it,
hating him only hurts me.

44:38.929 --> 44:41.699
So... I got your letter.

44:41.799 --> 44:43.534
Yeah?

44:43.634 --> 44:46.136
Thank you for coming back.

44:49.306 --> 44:51.542
I wanted to see you.

44:52.343 --> 44:55.212
I'm surprised that you could
even read that letter.

44:55.312 --> 44:57.515
I'm sure there was tons
of mistakes in it.

44:58.482 --> 45:00.651
I was never that good in school.

45:01.552 --> 45:03.688
You're taking classes in here, right?

45:03.788 --> 45:07.107
Yeah. I mean, yes.

45:07.207 --> 45:10.461
My teacher is a real hardass
for stuff like that.

45:10.561 --> 45:12.596
I'm sorry that I curse.

45:13.163 --> 45:17.868
- You say sorry a lot.
- I have a lot to be sorry for.

45:21.121 --> 45:23.841
What's something you're not sorry for?

45:23.941 --> 45:26.176
Something you're good at.

45:28.078 --> 45:30.731
I don't know, screwing up,
getting caught.

45:30.831 --> 45:32.633
I'm serious.

45:34.618 --> 45:36.420
Fixing things.

45:38.088 --> 45:40.391
I've always been good at that.

45:40.491 --> 45:45.196
When I was a kid if I broke something
my dad would always make me fix it.

45:45.296 --> 45:49.266
I mean, he'd beat the crap out of me,
and then he'd make me fix it.

45:51.335 --> 45:53.437
I started to like the way it felt.

45:53.537 --> 45:57.374
Putting things together, making it work.

46:01.111 --> 46:03.113
Kinda like you.

46:04.315 --> 46:08.453
- What do you mean?
- You're a nurse, aren't you?

46:09.553 --> 46:11.389
Yes, yes.

46:13.557 --> 46:16.560
I fix things, you fix people.

46:17.194 --> 46:19.130
Maybe we have something in common.

46:20.030 --> 46:22.426
I guess we do.

46:35.446 --> 46:38.716
Electronic stud finder.

46:40.117 --> 46:44.976
Whatever happened to banging on a wall
and listening for the beam?

46:49.426 --> 46:50.628
Well's Hardware.

46:50.728 --> 46:52.931
Daddy, I'm gonna nickname you
"Missed call".

46:53.031 --> 46:55.262
<i>Yeah, well, when I need you, I need you.</i>

46:55.362 --> 46:58.034
<i>I was in therapy. What do you need?</i>

46:58.134 --> 47:00.805
I need you to go check on Benny.

47:00.905 --> 47:04.158
- <i>Yeah, that's funny, I'm already with him.</i>
- You are?

47:04.258 --> 47:08.062
Yeah, and he's a lot more fun
now that he's doing what I tell him to.

47:08.162 --> 47:10.380
<i>Sit! Sit! Good boy.</i>

47:10.480 --> 47:12.820
<i>That's a good boy.</i>

47:12.920 --> 47:16.387
I can't believe you've had him
for five years and never taught him to sit.

47:16.487 --> 47:21.091
Now look at him and tell me something.
Does he look sick to you?

47:21.191 --> 47:24.995
- <i>Or am I just being a worry-wart?</i>
- No, he looks fine, Daddy.

47:25.095 --> 47:28.099
But then, you know, he always looks fine
when he's begging for food.

47:29.666 --> 47:32.203
Well, keep feeding him then. All right?

48:12.843 --> 48:16.213
Excuse me, ma'am,
are you here to see William Finn?

48:16.313 --> 48:19.083
- Yes.
- He's not gonna be able to see you today.

48:20.851 --> 48:22.520
Why not?

48:23.520 --> 48:25.789
He just can't.

49:05.282 --> 49:08.566
What, no scratch and sniff today, Billy?

49:10.467 --> 49:11.669
What are you talking about?

49:11.969 --> 49:16.006
That little piece of trim that keeps
coming up in here and visiting you.

49:16.106 --> 49:18.943
She looks uppity if you ask me.

49:20.277 --> 49:22.046
You know what she looks like?

49:22.146 --> 49:27.084
What, you think you're the only moon-faced
kid around here that gets any visitors?

49:27.184 --> 49:29.019
Billy.

49:30.487 --> 49:33.410
Hey. You stop talking about her.

49:35.425 --> 49:38.028
What do you think she wants
with you anyway?

49:39.329 --> 49:41.265
Shut up.

49:41.732 --> 49:45.669
Does she even know why you're here?

49:45.769 --> 49:48.138
Shut the fuck up.

49:49.990 --> 49:52.460
It takes 57 minutes each way.

49:52.910 --> 49:57.114
- I know.
- That is 114 minutes of my time, gone.

49:57.915 --> 50:00.884
There's a reason I couldn't
come out that day.

50:01.385 --> 50:03.921
All right? I got in trouble.

50:04.021 --> 50:06.023
What kind of trouble?

50:07.724 --> 50:11.646
- Some guys here like picking on me.
- So you got into a fight?

50:12.096 --> 50:16.033
No. No, not exactly.

50:16.133 --> 50:18.969
- They cornered me.
- Why you?

50:19.069 --> 50:23.140
- 'Cause they know I'm won't fight back.
- How do they know that?

50:23.240 --> 50:27.477
Because everyone in here
knows how badly I want to get out.

50:46.947 --> 50:49.417
So they cornered you and you had
to spend time in solitary?

50:50.934 --> 50:52.804
No, the infirmary.

50:53.570 --> 50:57.174
So... those guys who attacked you...

51:00.410 --> 51:02.346
What'd they do to you?

51:03.280 --> 51:05.554
Do you want to see?

51:28.573 --> 51:31.808
The old man's looking pretty sharp.

51:32.310 --> 51:35.612
Yeah, well... don't get too excited,
I re-gifted.

51:35.912 --> 51:38.736
Oh, come on.

51:39.466 --> 51:42.202
Well, you're gonna spend
the night, right?

51:43.253 --> 51:46.824
- Dad...
- No, no. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

51:46.924 --> 51:49.392
You know, heaven forbid
you spend one more minute

51:49.492 --> 51:52.014
with your father than you have to.

51:52.429 --> 51:55.866
Benny, you love me, don't you?
How you doing, Benny?

51:55.966 --> 51:58.002
Yeah.

51:58.669 --> 52:02.206
- Did you get him to eat?
- He ate.

52:04.341 --> 52:06.721
All gone.

52:07.778 --> 52:11.348
Yeah, I don't know. He sleeps so much.

52:11.448 --> 52:13.283
Maybe I should take him to the vet.

52:13.383 --> 52:15.817
He's not a puppy anymore, Dad.
He's getting old.

52:15.917 --> 52:18.572
I'm getting old, I'm retired, you know.

52:19.122 --> 52:24.169
Benny's still here, he's young.
You got some moves, right boy?

52:34.571 --> 52:37.059
What you looking at there, man?

52:38.375 --> 52:41.345
Something that doesn't belong to you.

52:42.313 --> 52:45.115
You really do miss pussy.

52:45.582 --> 52:48.118
I don't see why though.

52:48.218 --> 52:52.089
Seems to me there's plenty of pussy
right here in this cell.

52:59.196 --> 53:01.331
You know something, Randy?

53:01.431 --> 53:05.936
Your shits smell better than you do.

53:10.007 --> 53:12.209
You ever...

53:12.609 --> 53:15.281
ever touch my things again...

53:17.147 --> 53:21.727
And only the idea of you
will be left behind.

53:34.398 --> 53:37.868
- Did you get the card?
- Yeah. Yeah, I loved it.

53:37.968 --> 53:39.704
I loved it. Thank you so much.

53:40.204 --> 53:41.538
It was my mom's favorite holiday.

53:41.638 --> 53:45.176
She used to make me sign these valentines,
those little paper ones.

53:45.276 --> 53:48.695
- Your mom sounds like a good lady.
- She would've liked to hear you say that.

53:48.795 --> 53:51.299
Actually she died when I was nine.

53:53.350 --> 53:55.085
The...

53:55.519 --> 54:00.646
asthma attack, it was... she didn't
get to her medication on time. I...

54:00.746 --> 54:04.661
- was the one who found her.
- I'm sorry, that's terrible.

54:05.061 --> 54:06.797
It was a long time ago.

54:07.898 --> 54:10.033
Yeah, still.

54:10.501 --> 54:12.669
That must be hard. I'm sorry.

54:15.222 --> 54:18.542
- What about you?
- My mother?

54:21.278 --> 54:23.681
She left when I was 12.

54:25.315 --> 54:27.217
Do you hate her for that?

54:28.118 --> 54:30.554
I don't know how to hate anybody.

54:33.590 --> 54:36.092
Maybe if she'd stuck around...

54:37.327 --> 54:40.097
maybe I could've got on a better track.

54:42.232 --> 54:44.367
There's still time.

54:56.126 --> 54:58.415
I was starting to wonder
if I was gonna see you this week.

54:58.515 --> 55:00.784
With the holiday all my schedules
have been off, so...

55:01.184 --> 55:03.353
Memorial day.

55:05.589 --> 55:07.591
You're nervous.

55:08.124 --> 55:10.163
I'm getting paroled.

55:10.263 --> 55:12.077
Soon.

55:12.729 --> 55:16.300
- Does that make you nervous?
- Should I be?

55:16.900 --> 55:21.805
Well, I don't think that you would visit me
if you thought I'd be a threat out there.

55:22.372 --> 55:26.209
- So why'd you ask?
- Because...

55:27.277 --> 55:30.146
All I can think about in here...

55:30.647 --> 55:33.149
is how I'm gonna miss this.

55:37.988 --> 55:42.392
Look, if you don't want to see me
when I get out of here, I'll understand.

55:42.492 --> 55:45.028
But you gotta know right now...

55:45.896 --> 55:47.665
I would never do that again.

55:50.200 --> 55:53.403
So the prison thinks
you've been rehabilitated.

55:53.937 --> 55:56.239
They think I've served my time.

55:58.708 --> 56:01.210
Do you think you've served your time?

56:02.345 --> 56:05.582
Look, Miranda, I can't undo what I did.

56:08.184 --> 56:09.620
I know.

56:11.855 --> 56:14.858
I won't stop saying I'm sorry.

56:16.927 --> 56:19.496
I want to start fixing things.

56:22.499 --> 56:24.161
If you let me.

56:33.009 --> 56:35.345
Hey, I'm sorry...

56:36.746 --> 56:38.382
No!

56:38.482 --> 56:41.158
Oh, Daddy, I'm sorry.

56:43.720 --> 56:47.423
- God, look at me.
- It's okay. Here.

56:49.093 --> 56:52.829
- Take these.
- I should be able to do this.

56:52.929 --> 56:57.067
He was your best friend, Daddy.
It'd be a lot for anyone.

56:57.167 --> 56:58.812
I can do this.

56:58.912 --> 57:00.904
Where's the shovel? Is it in the back?

57:01.254 --> 57:03.654
- You're all dressed up.
- I know. I'll wear an apron.

57:03.754 --> 57:05.759
No, you're gonna get a mess
all over your clothes.

57:05.859 --> 57:09.226
Why don't you go out and get us some food
or something, and then when you come back

57:09.326 --> 57:10.594
I'll be finished.

57:11.581 --> 57:13.350
- Chinese Gourmet?
- Yeah.

57:13.450 --> 57:17.521
Yeah, those bird like things would...

57:18.221 --> 57:20.301
- Won...
- Won tons.

57:20.401 --> 57:22.993
Oh, sweetie, I'm sad.

57:23.093 --> 57:26.096
Just when you two were becoming friends.

57:27.024 --> 57:30.400
Alright. I'll be back.

57:51.555 --> 57:53.723
You know, your mother...

57:53.823 --> 57:57.427
used to complain a bit
that I wasn't around all the time.

57:57.527 --> 58:00.647
It was the hardware store.
I was trying to put it together.

58:00.747 --> 58:04.233
- You were providing.
- Yes, I know.

58:05.702 --> 58:08.705
It's... confusing.

58:08.805 --> 58:13.750
Be a father, and not be able
to protect your children.

58:15.645 --> 58:20.416
I wish I had found her, not you.
That's basically what I'm saying.

58:30.426 --> 58:32.295
You know, Daddy...

58:35.098 --> 58:38.835
with us it's... bad things happen...

58:39.202 --> 58:41.149
and we make the best of them.

58:42.839 --> 58:44.896
That's right.

58:45.809 --> 58:48.192
That's what we do.

58:56.686 --> 58:58.112
Randy.

58:59.222 --> 59:01.357
I'm leaving you.

59:02.659 --> 59:04.727
You gonna miss me?

59:05.961 --> 59:08.898
About as much as you gon' miss me.

59:09.666 --> 59:13.180
Randy, don't underestimate yourself.

59:16.205 --> 59:18.041
I've...

59:18.141 --> 59:21.177
actually grown quite attached to you.

59:26.049 --> 59:28.528
All this time together...

59:28.985 --> 59:31.221
this is how you say goodbye?

59:33.423 --> 59:35.225
Well...

59:37.560 --> 59:39.401
Somehow...

59:40.864 --> 59:43.367
I know that you won't forget me.

59:51.875 --> 59:54.410
Most people don't.

59:54.800 --> 59:57.042
Have you been to Florida?
Oh, my God, you have to go.

59:57.142 --> 59:59.631
- I would like to.
- Have you been to Florida?

59:59.731 --> 01:00:01.886
Hey, Miranda, come here.
You've got to look at this.

01:00:01.986 --> 01:00:03.047
Yeah, what is that?

01:00:03.147 --> 01:00:06.156
She just got back from her vacation
in Orlando. Show her.

01:00:06.256 --> 01:00:07.791
I swam with the dolphins.

01:00:07.891 --> 01:00:10.727
Poor sharks, no one
ever wants to swim with them.

01:00:10.827 --> 01:00:13.587
Here are the two kids at the Magic
Kingdom. That was super fun.

01:00:13.687 --> 01:00:16.233
- They got their faces painted.
- Cute! How old is he?

01:00:16.333 --> 01:00:18.268
- He's like, four.
- Oh, so cute.

01:00:18.368 --> 01:00:21.871
- Don't you have a vacation coming up?
- You should really go to Orlando.

01:00:21.971 --> 01:00:25.068
I... Florida in the summertime?
It seems redundant.

01:00:25.168 --> 01:00:27.377
- Where are you going, then?
- Canada?

01:00:27.477 --> 01:00:29.179
I'm staying home, actually.

01:00:29.279 --> 01:00:32.072
You can't stay home. It's your vacation.
What's the point?

01:00:32.172 --> 01:00:34.318
It's where my house is,
and I'm still working on it.

01:00:34.418 --> 01:00:36.754
And I'm gonna finish it
once and for all.

01:00:42.158 --> 01:00:44.527
She needs to find a man. Right?

01:00:44.627 --> 01:00:46.096
Miranda Wells?

01:00:46.824 --> 01:00:49.666
- Do y'all know Miranda?
- That's me.

01:00:55.839 --> 01:00:57.741
Thank you.

01:00:58.141 --> 01:01:02.782
- Who's it from?
- Oh, just my dad. You know how he is.

01:01:04.547 --> 01:01:07.083
Did she say from her dad?

01:01:10.086 --> 01:01:13.373
<i>Did you... did you get
the flowers I sent?</i>

01:01:13.473 --> 01:01:15.058
I got 'em.

01:01:15.158 --> 01:01:18.662
They were just delivered. At my work.

01:01:19.162 --> 01:01:23.400
You don't like 'em?
That's all I could afford right now.

01:01:24.501 --> 01:01:28.405
The flowers are not the problem,
William. They're fine.

01:01:28.505 --> 01:01:31.308
It's having them delivered
at my workplace is the problem.

01:01:32.843 --> 01:01:35.112
Oh, yeah, you don't want them
knowing about us?

01:01:39.015 --> 01:01:41.885
Not that there's an us. I'm sorry.

01:01:41.985 --> 01:01:45.689
- <i>Stop saying you're sorry.</i>
- Well, I just want to stay in touch.

01:01:46.089 --> 01:01:48.125
You could've written.
You could've called.

01:01:49.342 --> 01:01:50.337
I could?

01:01:50.437 --> 01:01:53.964
<i>Yeah, I thought I made that clear
last time I visited.</i>

01:01:56.366 --> 01:01:58.134
Well, I just...

01:01:58.234 --> 01:02:01.037
figured maybe you were just saying that.

01:02:01.504 --> 01:02:06.009
No, 'cause when I say something
I mean it.

01:02:06.409 --> 01:02:09.345
<i>I hope the same goes for you.</i>

01:02:14.818 --> 01:02:17.353
- <i>William?</i>
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:17.453 --> 01:02:19.481
Sorry, you...

01:02:19.781 --> 01:02:22.039
cut out. What'd you say?

01:02:24.828 --> 01:02:26.896
Doesn't matter.

01:02:39.542 --> 01:02:41.344
Fuck!

01:02:51.671 --> 01:02:53.320
Miranda?

01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:56.772
William! You're here.

01:03:01.765 --> 01:03:04.239
I promised I'd come.
You didn't believe me?

01:03:04.339 --> 01:03:07.621
No, I did, I did.
I just didn't expect you so soon.

01:03:08.071 --> 01:03:11.340
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

01:03:12.475 --> 01:03:14.644
Just anxious to fix things.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.415
Well, then let's get started.

01:03:20.299 --> 01:03:22.201
One minute.

01:03:35.698 --> 01:03:38.301
I'm gonna go get something to drink.

01:03:38.902 --> 01:03:41.304
You want some lemonade?

01:03:41.404 --> 01:03:43.406
Homemade.

01:03:43.506 --> 01:03:45.162
That sounds really good.

01:03:48.978 --> 01:03:51.014
Thank you.

01:04:26.215 --> 01:04:29.318
Wait, let me. I'll take that.

01:04:29.891 --> 01:04:31.954
I got it, thanks.

01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:35.991
Here?

01:04:42.298 --> 01:04:45.228
I... wanted to come back and...

01:04:45.328 --> 01:04:47.554
fix this hole here.

01:04:48.137 --> 01:04:50.206
If you'd let me.

01:04:50.306 --> 01:04:52.241
I insist.

01:04:55.044 --> 01:04:56.779
So...

01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:59.682
I'll see you?

01:05:01.184 --> 01:05:03.252
You'll see me.

01:05:05.388 --> 01:05:07.423
All right.

01:05:21.354 --> 01:05:27.215
No, just give me some Elmer's glue
and a straight head, and...

01:05:27.315 --> 01:05:30.113
well, I'll make you
something really good.

01:05:30.213 --> 01:05:33.349
You're as stubborn
as gum on carpet, Mitchell.

01:05:33.449 --> 01:05:37.687
If you pull those strings with Mr. Simmons
you can be as old school as you want.

01:05:37.787 --> 01:05:40.423
I'll tell you something. It's Simpson.

01:05:41.391 --> 01:05:44.260
And Jerry... Jerry's gonna
give you what you want.

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:48.598
- He'll give you your second story.
- Thank you, Mitchell.

01:05:48.698 --> 01:05:50.500
Welcome!

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.384
Hey...

01:05:55.338 --> 01:05:58.107
- I need some paint.
- Okay.

01:05:58.207 --> 01:06:00.994
- To match this color.
- Yeah, how much you need?

01:06:01.094 --> 01:06:04.147
I figure a gallon'll do.
Fix a porch ceiling.

01:06:04.247 --> 01:06:07.650
- Big hole in it.
- Okay. I'll get you set up.

01:06:40.616 --> 01:06:42.919
Okay, that's $21.15.

01:06:46.489 --> 01:06:48.224
Okay.

01:07:05.841 --> 01:07:08.444
It's just five cents more.

01:07:38.608 --> 01:07:40.443
Mitchell?

01:07:44.547 --> 01:07:46.015
Miranda!

01:07:47.666 --> 01:07:50.386
- Miranda!
- Daddy!

01:07:50.486 --> 01:07:52.038
What the hell are you thinking about?

01:07:52.138 --> 01:07:54.473
- What are you talking about?
- That son of a bitch!

01:07:54.573 --> 01:07:55.958
When did he get out?

01:07:56.058 --> 01:07:58.856
How does he have the nerve to get out

01:07:58.956 --> 01:08:02.160
- and show his face within 100 miles of here.
- Daddy, calm down. Calm down.

01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:06.669
I am calmed down!
He's a lowlife scumbag, Miranda.

01:08:06.769 --> 01:08:08.371
Has he been over here?

01:08:08.471 --> 01:08:09.639
- No.
- Tell me the truth.

01:08:09.739 --> 01:08:12.242
Then what is this, Miranda?
This is a chip of paint.

01:08:12.342 --> 01:08:16.679
He brought it into the shop.
It matches that ceiling.

01:08:17.412 --> 01:08:21.017
Daddy, listen, okay?
William's been here.

01:08:21.117 --> 01:08:25.772
- Please... don't say that name around me!
- Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

01:08:25.872 --> 01:08:28.466
He raped you, Miranda, right here
in this house! He raped you.

01:08:28.567 --> 01:08:31.294
I know that, Daddy.
And I'm not forgetting it.

01:08:32.094 --> 01:08:35.965
I'm letting him fix things. Okay?
He wants to fix things.

01:08:36.064 --> 01:08:38.667
This... Miranda, this can't be fixed!

01:08:38.768 --> 01:08:42.604
It can't be undone, Daddy, but I'm trying
to figure out a way to move on.

01:08:42.705 --> 01:08:46.742
- And this is how you do it?
- Tell me right way, Daddy.

01:08:47.475 --> 01:08:49.912
I don't know. You know...

01:08:50.595 --> 01:08:53.249
You want me to sit and cry
in therapy for 10 years

01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:55.885
writing in some goddamn journal
about my feelings?

01:08:55.984 --> 01:08:58.654
That's not me.
It'd be like drowning in a puddle.

01:08:58.754 --> 01:09:01.290
I'd be dying by inches.

01:09:02.308 --> 01:09:05.810
You want me to hate him forever?
That hurts no one but me.

01:09:06.496 --> 01:09:08.548
I'm tired of hurting.

01:09:08.648 --> 01:09:11.533
Miranda, there are
other options than that.

01:09:11.634 --> 01:09:14.868
Other options than having your rapist
over for dinner!

01:09:14.968 --> 01:09:18.808
He's fixing the porch, okay?
We're not over here sipping tea, Daddy.

01:09:18.908 --> 01:09:22.495
He fucking stays on the porch.
He's fixing the fucking porch!

01:09:22.595 --> 01:09:25.814
- Well, I can fix the porch!
- But I need him to fix it.

01:09:25.915 --> 01:09:28.550
Okay, that's what I need.

01:09:32.187 --> 01:09:34.689
I don't know you.

01:09:35.224 --> 01:09:37.513
I don't know you.

01:09:57.413 --> 01:09:58.964
You didn't show up.

01:09:59.064 --> 01:10:01.784
I did actually, I just...

01:10:01.884 --> 01:10:04.855
- Just didn't stay.
- You were here?

01:10:04.955 --> 01:10:07.990
Yeah. I was across the street.

01:10:08.424 --> 01:10:10.359
<i>I saw your dad.</i>

01:10:10.459 --> 01:10:12.329
<i>I heard him, too.</i>

01:10:12.429 --> 01:10:13.719
<i>I figure...</i>

01:10:14.597 --> 01:10:17.225
I best not stick around.

01:10:18.801 --> 01:10:20.633
<i>In fact...</i>

01:10:21.537 --> 01:10:24.106
I'm not sure it's such a good idea to...

01:10:24.407 --> 01:10:26.742
<i>to come around, period.</i>

01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:32.815
You still there?

01:10:34.583 --> 01:10:37.620
Listen. I know my dad...

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:41.257
an outburst like that he'll either sleep
or work for two weeks straight.

01:10:41.357 --> 01:10:43.109
He won't be back any time soon.

01:10:43.209 --> 01:10:46.245
Yeah, I just don't want
to cause more harm.

01:10:47.763 --> 01:10:51.231
You know, I feel like I've done
enough of that for a lifetime.

01:10:51.667 --> 01:10:53.636
<i>What do you think?</i>

01:10:53.736 --> 01:10:57.106
I think you're afraid
of a 70-year-old man.

01:11:12.221 --> 01:11:14.523
I wasn't sure you'd still come.

01:11:14.623 --> 01:11:16.859
I said I would.

01:11:18.694 --> 01:11:20.896
Oh, shit.

01:11:21.664 --> 01:11:23.933
- What?
- Sorry, I forgot the paint.

01:11:24.433 --> 01:11:27.130
It's okay, we have other things to do.

01:11:30.673 --> 01:11:33.275
You want a drink before we get started?

01:11:34.077 --> 01:11:36.417
Yeah, I'd appreciate that.

01:11:43.352 --> 01:11:47.805
I was thinking I might just try
this carpenter thing. Full time.

01:11:51.694 --> 01:11:53.695
What'd you say?

01:11:56.866 --> 01:11:59.135
I was just saying I could...

01:11:59.235 --> 01:12:01.270
get used to this.

01:12:05.374 --> 01:12:07.493
Too sweet?

01:12:07.593 --> 01:12:10.561
- No, it's perfect.
- Good.

01:12:47.116 --> 01:12:50.665
Can I... give you a hand?

01:12:52.121 --> 01:12:53.182
Sure.

01:13:35.648 --> 01:13:37.707
You're dripping.

01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:39.835
Shit.

01:13:39.935 --> 01:13:41.366
I'm sorry about that.

01:14:08.964 --> 01:14:10.633
Something wrong?

01:14:11.133 --> 01:14:13.202
I don't know, my...

01:14:15.571 --> 01:14:18.540
My stomach's just feeling
a little messed up.

01:14:30.819 --> 01:14:32.721
What'd you eat today?

01:14:32.821 --> 01:14:35.457
Just some clam chowder.

01:14:35.691 --> 01:14:37.693
That'll do it.

01:14:39.497 --> 01:14:43.899
Look, I'm so... I'm sorry about this.
Can I maybe just...

01:14:44.467 --> 01:14:46.735
use your bathroom?

01:14:46.835 --> 01:14:48.471
Just lie down for a minute?

01:14:48.771 --> 01:14:52.141
- Could you go home?
- No, I don't think I can make it home.

01:14:52.741 --> 01:14:55.294
Look, maybe if I just...

01:14:56.245 --> 01:14:59.332
If I just get where it's cool inside.

01:14:59.432 --> 01:15:03.849
I'm just... I'm sorry,
I'm really not feeling too well.

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:06.011
It's okay.

01:15:10.492 --> 01:15:12.361
Okay.

01:15:12.461 --> 01:15:14.330
Sure.

01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:17.166
You can come in.

01:15:36.752 --> 01:15:38.587
Well...

01:15:48.697 --> 01:15:50.732
Hey, you.

01:15:57.139 --> 01:15:59.141
What happened?

01:16:00.009 --> 01:16:01.554
You passed out.

01:16:08.216 --> 01:16:10.225
Thank you.

01:16:18.661 --> 01:16:20.300
You are so pretty.

01:16:22.998 --> 01:16:26.435
- Thank you, William.
- Look at you...

01:16:26.535 --> 01:16:28.604
taking such good care of me.

01:16:29.905 --> 01:16:32.703
It's the thing we have
in common, remember?

01:16:33.409 --> 01:16:36.879
- Yeah, I fix things.
- Exactly, and I fix people.

01:16:50.359 --> 01:16:52.134
You know what's wrong with me?

01:16:52.728 --> 01:16:54.830
Of course I do.

01:16:54.930 --> 01:16:56.732
Yeah?

01:16:59.301 --> 01:17:01.670
You're a rapist, William.

01:17:01.770 --> 01:17:04.272
That's what's wrong with you.

01:17:06.975 --> 01:17:09.378
Miranda. Hey!

01:17:09.478 --> 01:17:11.313
What the fuck...

01:17:11.413 --> 01:17:14.237
What the fuck is...

01:17:14.884 --> 01:17:16.869
What are you doing?

01:17:16.969 --> 01:17:21.434
Surely you didn't think I'd forgotten
that you came into my home and raped me?

01:17:22.491 --> 01:17:24.060
Did you make me sick?

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:29.986
No. The antifreeze made you sick.
I just provided it to you.

01:17:34.369 --> 01:17:37.084
Oh, come on, I didn't give you
any more than I gave Benny,

01:17:37.184 --> 01:17:39.475
and you got a good 70 pounds on him.

01:17:42.211 --> 01:17:44.079
You fucking crazy?

01:17:44.379 --> 01:17:46.181
No.

01:17:46.882 --> 01:17:49.442
No, I'm not crazy, William.

01:17:49.542 --> 01:17:53.455
Crazy suggests that I don't know
right from wrong.

01:17:53.555 --> 01:17:55.657
And I do.

01:17:55.757 --> 01:17:59.261
This... is clearly wrong.

01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:03.366
Miranda... look at me.

01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:07.147
You're a nurse.

01:18:08.036 --> 01:18:10.827
That means you save people.

01:18:12.174 --> 01:18:15.878
I saw you save that man
that was choking.

01:18:15.978 --> 01:18:18.013
I was there.

01:18:18.113 --> 01:18:20.432
You saved his life.

01:18:20.532 --> 01:18:22.535
You saw that?

01:18:22.985 --> 01:18:24.420
You saw what I got to do?

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:27.545
I got to stick a knife into
a man's throat in broad daylight,

01:18:27.645 --> 01:18:30.258
and people wanted me to do it.

01:18:31.059 --> 01:18:33.595
In fact, they applauded.

01:18:36.098 --> 01:18:39.601
- What are you doing?
- Room service.

01:18:43.138 --> 01:18:46.082
What did you give me, Miranda?

01:18:51.013 --> 01:18:54.325
<i>Don't worry. You won't feel a thing.</i>

01:19:17.572 --> 01:19:19.908
I'm getting good at this.

01:19:27.316 --> 01:19:29.789
All right, I get it.

01:19:39.729 --> 01:19:44.719
I'm kind of surprised you trust me
to give you water. Considering.

01:19:50.438 --> 01:19:52.241
Go ahead.

01:19:52.341 --> 01:19:56.262
Go ahead and drink, William.
At this point what do you have to lose?

01:19:57.546 --> 01:19:59.648
You wanna watch?

01:20:09.791 --> 01:20:11.660
Hold that thought.

01:20:25.274 --> 01:20:27.102
Now...

01:20:28.410 --> 01:20:30.712
You stay right there.

01:21:10.719 --> 01:21:13.456
- Do you have something for me?
- Yes, ma'am, it's right there.

01:21:17.159 --> 01:21:19.161
Thank you.

01:21:59.167 --> 01:22:00.858
Please.

01:22:00.958 --> 01:22:03.672
Don't. Please.

01:22:03.772 --> 01:22:06.076
Just in time.

01:22:10.445 --> 01:22:13.782
Used up my very last one three days ago.

01:22:14.516 --> 01:22:17.286
- Oh, it hurts, doesn't it?
- What are you doing to me?

01:22:17.386 --> 01:22:21.123
I'm sorry it hurts,
I know it hurts. Here.

01:22:21.223 --> 01:22:25.594
Hold my hand.
Hold my hand, there you go.

01:22:25.694 --> 01:22:28.330
There you go, squeeze
all you want. That's it.

01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:31.400
William, you're hurting me!
William! Stop it, stop it!

01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:36.070
You're hurting me, stop it, stop it!
William, let go, let go, let go!

01:22:40.409 --> 01:22:43.512
Thank God that's not my hand.

01:22:44.613 --> 01:22:46.654
What the fuck?

01:22:48.117 --> 01:22:50.253
What is that?

01:22:51.053 --> 01:22:55.641
Honestly, you know, I'm not even
allowed to perform surgery.

01:22:55.741 --> 01:22:57.392
Not even allowed to assist in surgery.

01:22:57.492 --> 01:23:00.762
I've been having
this terrible problem with my hand.

01:23:00.862 --> 01:23:02.731
Help!

01:23:02.831 --> 01:23:04.667
Hey!

01:23:05.267 --> 01:23:08.269
I developed this terrible twitch.

01:23:14.276 --> 01:23:16.578
It's getting better.

01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:20.058
That's so weird.

01:23:21.616 --> 01:23:25.654
You should really look
at yourself. Here.

01:23:28.457 --> 01:23:31.293
Seriously though,
look at your expression.

01:23:31.393 --> 01:23:33.528
Your eyes.

01:23:33.628 --> 01:23:37.666
It's fascinating, isn't it?
That's why I work in critical care.

01:23:37.766 --> 01:23:40.435
You get to see what really
matters to people.

01:23:40.535 --> 01:23:44.907
You're not a killer.
I know you're not a killer.

01:23:45.007 --> 01:23:47.875
You're not gonna let me die.

01:23:49.561 --> 01:23:52.434
I let my mother die, William.

01:23:53.581 --> 01:23:57.436
She did a lot of things,
but she didn't fuck me from behind.

01:24:00.088 --> 01:24:03.892
So really, William, the question is...

01:24:05.293 --> 01:24:07.662
What matters to you?

01:24:07.963 --> 01:24:09.965
You do.

01:24:12.267 --> 01:24:14.303
You do.

01:24:15.053 --> 01:24:18.107
- I do?
- Yeah.

01:24:18.807 --> 01:24:22.144
'Cause you're pretty stupid
and predictable.

01:24:22.244 --> 01:24:24.413
You know that?

01:24:24.513 --> 01:24:27.028
Oh, I almost forgot.

01:24:27.782 --> 01:24:29.966
What goodies did you bring?

01:24:31.887 --> 01:24:34.686
What's in the backpack?

01:24:37.358 --> 01:24:39.727
No, Miranda!

01:24:46.668 --> 01:24:48.570
Wallet.

01:24:50.505 --> 01:24:52.407
Keys.

01:24:54.342 --> 01:24:57.258
Don't tell me you were that optimistic.

01:24:59.514 --> 01:25:02.350
That's not what it looks like.

01:25:04.386 --> 01:25:07.355
I wasn't gonna do anything with that.

01:25:07.455 --> 01:25:09.458
You know what I was thinking...

01:25:09.558 --> 01:25:12.260
when you were raping me?

01:25:14.663 --> 01:25:17.687
When I thought that I might die...

01:25:21.169 --> 01:25:22.550
I was thinking...

01:25:25.607 --> 01:25:27.909
Is it in yet?

01:25:31.513 --> 01:25:34.359
'Cause I couldn't feel a thing.

01:25:37.586 --> 01:25:40.187
But I'm pretty certain
that you feel me now, don't you?

01:25:50.932 --> 01:25:53.440
Take a look at yourself.

01:25:58.607 --> 01:26:00.642
Go on.

01:26:05.747 --> 01:26:08.316
Help! Help!

01:26:08.416 --> 01:26:10.585
- Help!
- You're right, William...

01:26:11.186 --> 01:26:13.154
I win.

01:26:22.263 --> 01:26:24.265
I win.

01:26:50.024 --> 01:26:53.194
- Daddy, I'm so sorry.
- Don't...

01:26:53.595 --> 01:26:55.597
apologize.

01:26:56.231 --> 01:26:57.932
Please don't.

01:26:58.032 --> 01:27:00.668
I know that it's...

01:27:02.304 --> 01:27:04.289
I know that this doesn't make
a lot of sense...

01:27:04.389 --> 01:27:06.224
Manny.

01:27:06.574 --> 01:27:09.077
It doesn't make any sense.

01:27:09.177 --> 01:27:11.246
At all.

01:27:13.882 --> 01:27:17.140
You were so strong, Miranda.

01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:23.441
When your mother died,
everyone figured you would rebel,

01:27:23.541 --> 01:27:26.618
cause all sorts of troubles.

01:27:27.095 --> 01:27:31.466
But you stayed the course.
You stayed levelheaded.

01:27:34.336 --> 01:27:37.572
For the first time in my life...

01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:41.576
I'm scared.

01:27:43.178 --> 01:27:45.747
I'm really worried about you.

01:27:47.449 --> 01:27:50.919
- You don't have to worry.
- This is your life.

01:27:51.319 --> 01:27:53.421
I know that, Daddy.

01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:58.559
So I put an end to it.

01:28:02.246 --> 01:28:05.049
He won't be coming around anymore.

01:30:04.152 --> 01:30:06.361
<i>Strength</i>

01:30:09.691 --> 01:30:13.907
<i>We'll fight another day</i>

01:30:16.264 --> 01:30:20.335
<i>To break the silence</i>

01:30:20.435 --> 01:30:25.790
<i>Of a sleepless mind</i>

01:30:37.419 --> 01:30:39.654
<i>Fend</i>

01:30:42.724 --> 01:30:47.015
<i>For your and my own sake</i>

01:30:49.363 --> 01:30:53.451
<i>We sail together</i>

01:30:53.551 --> 01:30:58.921
<i>Through the blazing sky</i>

01:31:10.285 --> 01:31:13.254
<i>Send us shining</i>

01:31:13.354 --> 01:31:16.591
<i>Out of this state</i>

01:31:16.691 --> 01:31:19.928
<i>Divided we let go</i>

01:31:20.028 --> 01:31:23.165
<i>Unite us we'll pay</i>

01:31:23.265 --> 01:31:26.434
<i>For times our freedom</i>

01:31:26.534 --> 01:31:29.771
<i>Leads us in vain</i>

01:31:29.871 --> 01:31:33.141
<i>Derided we stand down</i>

01:31:33.241 --> 01:31:36.878
<i>All blinded by faith</i>

01:31:36.978 --> 01:31:39.247
<i>Mend</i>

01:31:42.318 --> 01:31:46.555
<i>Our hearts won't lay astray</i>

01:31:48.890 --> 01:31:52.994
<i>They soar forever</i>

01:31:53.094 --> 01:31:58.468
<i>Elevate us high</i>

01:32:09.994 --> 01:32:12.197
<i>Bend</i>

01:32:15.433 --> 01:32:20.137
<i>This life through our own ways</i>

01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:26.060
<i>As freedom comes on</i>

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:28.680
<i>Clouds of smoke</i>

01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:31.291
<i>We rise</i>

01:32:42.994 --> 01:32:45.890
<i>Send us shining</i>

01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:49.337
<i>Out of this state</i>

01:32:49.437 --> 01:32:52.641
<i>Divided we let go</i>

01:32:52.741 --> 01:32:55.873
<i>Unite us we'll pay</i>

01:32:55.973 --> 01:32:59.177
<i>For times our freedom</i>

01:32:59.277 --> 01:33:02.480
<i>Leads us in vain</i>

01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:05.800
<i>Derided we stand down</i>

01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:10.138
<i>All blinded by faith</i>

01:33:11.305 --> 01:33:17.490
