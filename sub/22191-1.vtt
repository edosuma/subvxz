00:38.321 --> 00:41.908
Okay. Five-card draw poker.

00:42.114 --> 00:43.502
You in, Cincinnati?

00:43.508 --> 00:44.800
Of course he's in.

00:44.806 --> 00:47.025
Come on, Rimmer. Deal the cards.

00:47.434 --> 00:49.581
Matchsticks, nothing more.

00:49.587 --> 00:51.461
If you think you're
winning my back issues

00:51.486 --> 00:54.393
of Morris Dancer Monthly,
you've got another think coming.

00:55.869 --> 00:57.769
Here we go!

00:58.159 --> 01:01.667
One, two, three, four, five.

01:03.288 --> 01:05.769
Let's see what we got!

01:07.994 --> 01:09.562
Where are our cards?

01:09.568 --> 01:10.886
You ain't getting any.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.540
Without cards, we can't win.

01:13.546 --> 01:14.746
Exactly.

01:15.914 --> 01:17.699
What kind of game is that?

01:17.705 --> 01:19.307
A good game!

01:19.332 --> 01:21.112
A game I'm gonna win.

01:21.118 --> 01:23.118
Look, let's try it another way

01:23.124 --> 01:26.072
so that we all get five cards

01:26.097 --> 01:29.427
and we all get a chance to win.

01:29.433 --> 01:31.241
You might just enjoy it.

01:45.685 --> 01:47.592
How many cards you wanna change?

01:47.598 --> 01:49.287
None! Are you crazy?

01:50.583 --> 01:52.997
You've got a really good hand, right?

01:53.185 --> 01:54.594
How did you know?

01:55.874 --> 01:58.578
- Have you never heard of a poker face?
- Huh?

01:58.584 --> 02:01.491
You get your cards and you
look at them like this...

02:15.759 --> 02:17.497
and you don't give anything away.

02:17.522 --> 02:19.611
All right? Let's try it again.

02:45.655 --> 02:47.801
How many cards do you wanna change?

02:50.876 --> 02:52.402
Five!

02:55.267 --> 02:58.509
- [BEEPING]
- Sirs, we're picking up an SSL.

02:58.978 --> 03:00.978
It's in the neighbouring vector.

03:06.081 --> 03:08.293
Okay. Start her up.

03:28.575 --> 03:31.499
As silky as the first day we got her.

03:40.850 --> 03:43.730
Moon base coming up
on our starboard side.

03:43.834 --> 03:45.248
What is this place, Krytes?

03:45.254 --> 03:46.945
Mm, according to the ident,

03:46.951 --> 03:50.326
it's a United America
scientific research station.

03:50.332 --> 03:53.933
- United America? Who's that?
- Well, at the end of the 23rd century,

03:53.939 --> 03:57.084
America attempted to
bring peace to the world

03:57.090 --> 04:01.054
by asking every nation on
Earth to sign a peace treaty.

04:01.190 --> 04:03.894
Any nation that refused, they invaded.

04:04.182 --> 04:08.154
Now, a war ensued that was
called the War Against War.

04:08.160 --> 04:11.655
Those countries who went to war
because they were so against war,

04:11.661 --> 04:15.460
they were prepared to go to war
to fight in a war against war,

04:15.466 --> 04:18.185
called themselves United America.

04:18.190 --> 04:20.716
But why would these
United America Johnnies

04:20.723 --> 04:23.094
want to build a research
station way out here?

04:23.100 --> 04:25.623
By the looks of their manifest,
they're loaded with tech.

04:25.629 --> 04:29.008
Maybe we can finally
fix Starbug's thruster.

04:29.082 --> 04:31.432
I'm sick of always having to turn left.

04:32.088 --> 04:34.797
Alrighty. Bringing her in.

04:57.073 --> 05:00.819
There's a sandstorm coming
in; 18 on the Newton scale.

05:00.825 --> 05:03.099
Looks we're going to be
stuck here for a while.

05:03.105 --> 05:04.628
Any idea what they did here, Krytes?

05:04.653 --> 05:08.148
Well, it appears they were
testing a cure for evil, sir.

05:08.154 --> 05:11.354
Evil? But you can't cure
evil, that's ridiculous.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.954
What did they do, hand
out tubes of evil ointment?

05:13.960 --> 05:17.120
"Gently rub into your frontal
lobes when feeling psychotic."

05:18.274 --> 05:20.348
To be honest, I've never
really believed in evil.

05:20.354 --> 05:22.861
You should try inhaling
your socks sometimes!

05:23.715 --> 05:24.915
Well, Okay.

05:24.921 --> 05:27.837
Some people do terrible things,
but not because they're evil.

05:27.843 --> 05:29.577
It's 'cause they're mentally bonkers.

05:29.843 --> 05:32.460
I never realised you read
up on the subject, Listy.

05:32.466 --> 05:35.594
"Mentally bonkers"? I'm
struggling a bit to keep up here.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.072
You mean, they're psychopaths.

05:37.078 --> 05:39.617
Well, not all psychopaths
kill, of course, sir.

05:39.623 --> 05:40.823
They don't?

05:40.829 --> 05:44.672
Most psychopaths lack empathy
for others and have no remorse,

05:44.678 --> 05:47.528
but, as a rule, they don't
actually physically harm anyone.

05:47.534 --> 05:48.734
So, what do they do, then?

05:48.740 --> 05:50.651
Well, many go into banking.

05:52.643 --> 05:57.129
Many others are CEOs, businessmen,
lawyers, even politicians.

05:57.229 --> 06:00.007
Ruthless men and women
drawn to positions of power

06:00.013 --> 06:01.618
and the reward that brings.

06:01.624 --> 06:05.406
This evil cure, Kryten, any
idea who they tested it on?

06:05.412 --> 06:07.812
You think there might be
wall-to-wall crazies in here,

06:07.818 --> 06:10.634
running around rioting,
screaming and stabbing people?

06:10.640 --> 06:12.537
You make it sound like my old school!

06:13.634 --> 06:16.718
I want all the bazookoids'
safeties off, ready to fire.

06:16.724 --> 06:19.254
All the bazookoids are
back on Red Dwarf, sir.

06:19.333 --> 06:21.669
[HE SIGHS] Have we got any guns with us?

06:21.675 --> 06:23.269
Just your staple gun, sir.

06:23.979 --> 06:25.379
Fill her up.

06:29.757 --> 06:32.591
Hey, cryobooths.

06:34.834 --> 06:36.034
Look at this.

06:37.712 --> 06:40.034
"Vlad The Impaler, cured."

06:42.514 --> 06:44.726
"Josef Stalin, cured."

06:45.724 --> 06:48.133
"Messalina, cured."

06:49.483 --> 06:51.879
"Adolf Hitler, cured"?

06:54.765 --> 06:56.270
"Rupert Murdoch.

06:58.074 --> 07:00.157
"Not responding to treatment."

07:03.548 --> 07:06.148
Hitler? Isn't he dead?

07:06.154 --> 07:08.144
I thought he died playing golf.

07:09.634 --> 07:12.551
He was in Berlin, you goit, in a bunker.

07:15.954 --> 07:18.354
He poisoned his partner
and shot himself.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.235
Ha, golf can do that to you!

07:22.351 --> 07:24.343
All these people are
from ancient history.

07:24.349 --> 07:25.867
Where did they get them from?

07:25.873 --> 07:28.958
It appears they tracked
down their descendants

07:28.964 --> 07:31.662
and then, with DNA
regression technology,

07:31.668 --> 07:34.292
travelled back down the ancestral line

07:34.317 --> 07:36.857
via their mitochondrial DNA

07:36.863 --> 07:38.364
and recreated them.

07:38.370 --> 07:42.264
But Hitler didn't have any kids.
His ancestral line died with him.

07:42.270 --> 07:45.266
I read this conspiracy book once
and it proposed the theory that

07:45.272 --> 07:47.266
at the end of the Second World War,

07:47.272 --> 07:50.661
Hitler killed his wife and
his body double to make it look

07:50.667 --> 07:51.956
as if he'd committed suicide.

07:51.962 --> 07:55.371
Then, he snuck off to
Argentina in a stolen U-boat

07:55.377 --> 07:57.997
with art treasures looted
from the museums of Europe.

07:58.003 --> 08:01.199
Hitler, the more you
hear about that guy...

08:02.191 --> 08:05.824
The story went that when he reached
Argentina, he had kids there.

08:05.830 --> 08:07.418
Well, there's a long-held belief

08:07.424 --> 08:10.862
that memories are indeed
encoded in DNA, sir,

08:10.868 --> 08:13.068
and passed down the ancestral line.

08:13.074 --> 08:17.235
It explains why humans have
seemingly inexplicable phobias.

08:17.241 --> 08:19.362
- Like?
- Fear of rats, for example.

08:19.368 --> 08:22.880
Fear of rats, descendants beware;
they spread bubonic plague.

08:22.886 --> 08:25.060
- Precisely.
- Fear of clowns.

08:25.066 --> 08:28.657
Descendants beware of weird-looking
children's entertainers,

08:28.663 --> 08:30.271
they can be really dodgy!

08:31.669 --> 08:33.668
So, who's this Messalina?

08:33.674 --> 08:36.988
The third wife of the
Roman Emperor Claudius,

08:36.994 --> 08:39.613
possibly the most depraved, brutal

08:39.619 --> 08:42.691
and murderous nymphomaniac in history.

08:42.697 --> 08:44.193
Not all bad, then.

08:44.894 --> 08:48.089
These are some of the most damaged
and deranged humans who ever lived.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.281
They're worse than the
1970s Leeds United team.

08:52.197 --> 08:53.893
So, how did they cure these people?

08:53.899 --> 08:55.679
In people labelled evil,

08:55.685 --> 08:59.488
a misfiring gene has
often turned empathy off.

08:59.494 --> 09:02.095
So, they can just flick it
back on like a light switch?

09:02.101 --> 09:04.859
- As easy as that?
- Hey, light switches can be tricky.

09:04.865 --> 09:06.837
I don't always get them first time.

09:07.614 --> 09:09.708
There's another cryobooth here.

09:09.714 --> 09:11.875
Professor Shawl Telford.

09:11.881 --> 09:13.096
Maybe he can help us?

09:13.102 --> 09:14.965
I suggest we release the professor

09:14.971 --> 09:17.831
and ask him if they have the
tech here to repair the thruster.

09:19.792 --> 09:21.487
Hey, this one is empty.

09:21.803 --> 09:23.507
Indeed it is.

09:24.303 --> 09:25.829
Good day, gentlemen.

09:25.897 --> 09:27.319
Your arrival here

09:27.325 --> 09:30.721
automatically triggered the
cryobooths to release mode.

09:30.727 --> 09:33.823
Wait, when you said we automatically
triggered the cryobooths,

09:33.829 --> 09:35.822
did you mean all the cryobooths?

09:35.828 --> 09:38.128
You have nothing to fear.

09:38.134 --> 09:41.354
My patients have been
cured for many centuries.

09:41.434 --> 09:44.644
Come, join us for lunch.

09:51.470 --> 09:53.074
Let me introduce you.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.391
Josef Stalin.

09:54.397 --> 09:56.798
Idiots, erm... call me Joe.

09:57.474 --> 09:58.828
Adolf Hitler.

09:58.834 --> 10:00.414
Please, call me Dolfy.

10:00.420 --> 10:02.989
No "mein fuhrers", that's the old me.

10:03.198 --> 10:04.398
Messalina.

10:04.404 --> 10:07.014
Call me, er, any time.

10:07.020 --> 10:08.710
[ALL LAUGH]

10:08.716 --> 10:10.534
She is such a joker.

10:10.540 --> 10:13.034
It is so lovely for us to have guests.

10:13.040 --> 10:16.424
Some wine? Let me be mutter.

10:17.122 --> 10:19.415
Now, appetisers.

10:19.421 --> 10:21.651
Pumpernickel canapes, we
just got them out of cryo.

10:21.657 --> 10:23.337
I made them myself.

10:23.507 --> 10:24.911
Dragon fruit?

10:28.145 --> 10:30.456
Ha-ha-ha-ha! It's a keeper.

10:30.528 --> 10:32.968
Oh, and you must try his puddings.

10:33.058 --> 10:36.141
Dolfy makes the most
divine choux pastry.

10:36.147 --> 10:40.266
Messy, please, you're
embarrassing me. She's terrible.

10:40.850 --> 10:43.241
Oh, sorry I'm late.

10:43.444 --> 10:44.647
May I sit here?

10:44.672 --> 10:45.916
Sure.

10:46.184 --> 10:48.583
I'm Vlad The Impaler.

10:48.589 --> 10:52.125
Ah! Are you on your own, or
is there a Mrs The Impaler?

10:54.587 --> 10:56.793
What about all the other scientists?

10:56.799 --> 10:58.900
I mean, surely you
weren't here on your own?

10:58.906 --> 11:03.686
Well, many years ago, they sent a
special task force to eliminate us,

11:03.771 --> 11:07.609
but with our pooled skills,
we managed to survive.

11:07.615 --> 11:09.975
Why would they try to eliminate you?

11:09.981 --> 11:12.821
A cure for evil would
mean an end to war.

11:12.827 --> 11:15.608
An end to war would
mean no arms industry.

11:15.614 --> 11:18.330
Which would mean trillions
of lost dollar/pounds.

11:18.336 --> 11:20.021
The First World economy would slump.

11:20.027 --> 11:22.601
The Second and Third
World economy would boom.

11:22.607 --> 11:25.100
There would be no one to exploit.

11:25.106 --> 11:27.113
Society wouldn't work any more.

11:27.119 --> 11:29.918
Yes, they couldn't allow
the end of evil to happen.

11:30.394 --> 11:32.433
So, they marooned us here

11:32.698 --> 11:35.169
with no hope of getting back to Earth.

11:36.089 --> 11:37.691
But enough!

11:37.697 --> 11:40.308
Let us eat. There is much to do.

11:40.314 --> 11:43.282
After lunch, we must show you
our engineering department.

11:43.288 --> 11:45.648
In the meantime, a toast.

11:47.714 --> 11:49.914
To new friends.

11:49.920 --> 11:51.793
New friends.

11:52.316 --> 11:54.020
New friends.

11:54.026 --> 11:55.309
Selfie!

12:10.589 --> 12:13.768
Tea? Or as you English say,

12:13.774 --> 12:16.193
would you like a nice cup of chow?

12:16.457 --> 12:18.199
I'm fine, thanks.

12:22.334 --> 12:24.545
I hope you don't mind me saying this,

12:24.551 --> 12:26.726
but I just totally adore your jacket.

12:27.174 --> 12:28.572
Where did you buy it?

12:28.775 --> 12:31.979
London? Paris? New York?

12:32.054 --> 12:35.984
I bought it in a second-hand shop
on Mimas, then I painted it myself.

12:35.990 --> 12:37.590
Nein way!

12:37.978 --> 12:40.404
Your manipulation of
the palette is dazzling.

12:40.787 --> 12:42.594
And your use of saturated colours

12:42.600 --> 12:45.998
to celebrate the counterculture
spirit of the piece is so...

12:46.990 --> 12:49.220
chic and fun!

12:50.166 --> 12:51.926
That's what I was going for.

12:51.979 --> 12:54.573
It so... works.

12:55.574 --> 12:57.355
Did you go to art school?

12:57.510 --> 12:58.727
Yeah.

12:58.733 --> 13:01.856
Get out of town! I
went to art school, too!

13:02.705 --> 13:05.108
Well, I applied, but
they wouldn't take me.

13:05.534 --> 13:08.184
You probably didn't fail enough exams.

13:10.440 --> 13:11.644
Still paint?

13:11.650 --> 13:14.004
Not so much, since I was reincarnated.

13:14.010 --> 13:16.436
I'm trying to explore
other sides of myself.

13:16.442 --> 13:18.022
I play guitar now.

13:18.522 --> 13:20.826
Get out of town. I play guitar.

13:20.832 --> 13:23.108
You are scheissing me!

13:23.394 --> 13:25.432
We should jam sometime.

13:26.254 --> 13:27.934
Yeah, maybe.

13:28.014 --> 13:30.735
Are you waiting for these
pieces to dry? How about now?

13:32.012 --> 13:34.298
Look, I can't jam with you, okay?

13:40.414 --> 13:42.468
It's because I'm Hitler, isn't it?

25:11.725 --> 25:15.350
One is the cat. The second is...

25:15.533 --> 25:17.439
it's Professor Telford.

25:19.221 --> 25:22.542
Hey, how come he's walking? I
thought he needed a wheelchair.

25:22.548 --> 25:24.357
He was faking it.

25:24.827 --> 25:28.147
[WHIRRING]

25:34.213 --> 25:37.021
- They're droids!
- So, who are you?

25:37.027 --> 25:41.034
United America, head of
Research and Development.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.728
I was a neuroscientist.

25:42.734 --> 25:45.708
I brain-hacked entire populations

25:45.714 --> 25:47.631
and made them attack themselves,

25:47.637 --> 25:50.016
before my arrest and execution.

25:50.022 --> 25:52.504
You were the patient. The only patient.

25:52.578 --> 25:54.618
They were the scientists
trying to cure you.

25:54.624 --> 25:56.442
Indeed they were.

25:56.448 --> 25:58.719
I mean, did it strike you as curious

25:58.725 --> 26:02.512
that Hitler didn't really
look very much like Hitler?

26:04.906 --> 26:07.915
He was an android neuroscientist,

26:07.921 --> 26:11.610
physically identical to his
creator, Professor John Asquith.

26:11.804 --> 26:13.789
I rewrote his programming.

26:13.795 --> 26:15.486
There's one thing I don't understand.

26:15.492 --> 26:17.482
Why didn't you leg it
when we were trapped?

26:17.488 --> 26:19.882
Well, I did, but I
couldn't start Starbug.

26:19.980 --> 26:24.578
It must have some special
ignition sequence. What is it?

26:24.584 --> 26:29.210
Ah! So, you can't go
anywhere without us.

26:29.288 --> 26:31.368
I only need one of you.

26:31.374 --> 26:33.304
The rest of you,

26:33.382 --> 26:35.364
are going to die.

26:35.564 --> 26:36.997
- You!
- Who, me?

26:37.003 --> 26:38.407
You have no loyalty to them.

26:38.413 --> 26:41.971
A cat has no fidelity to
anyone but himself. Join me.

26:41.977 --> 26:45.860
I don't care what the damn
scan says. We're the posse!

26:45.866 --> 26:48.847
- Boys from the Dwarf.
- Yeah!

26:48.940 --> 26:52.254
- No one's changing sides here.
- Uh-uh!

26:52.260 --> 26:55.611
- I'll give you anything that you want.
- Sounds good!

26:57.830 --> 26:59.152
Cat, man!

26:59.158 --> 27:03.008
Hey, I'm a cat. It's my
nature! I can't help it!

27:03.014 --> 27:05.519
You heard him; I have no fidelity.

27:05.525 --> 27:07.723
Well, in that case,
sir, why be on his side?

27:07.729 --> 27:09.974
- Be on ours.
- Okay.

27:11.479 --> 27:14.082
I'll give you anything
that your heart desires

27:14.088 --> 27:16.898
if you join me and show
me how the ship starts.

27:16.904 --> 27:18.291
OK, deal!

27:18.486 --> 27:21.276
I'll give you anything
your heart desires

27:21.282 --> 27:25.413
plus a special secret
surprise if you join us.

27:25.419 --> 27:28.127
I love secret surprises!

27:28.300 --> 27:30.115
They're not going to
be giving you anything

27:30.121 --> 27:32.409
'cause pretty soon,
they're going to be dead.

27:32.415 --> 27:36.903
In fact, let me prove it to
you by killing them one by one.

27:36.909 --> 27:38.109
No, wait!

27:38.214 --> 27:40.808
I'm with you, but I get to do it.

27:41.297 --> 27:42.497
Hmm?

27:42.726 --> 27:44.430
Can I trust you?

27:44.436 --> 27:46.217
Can I?

27:47.868 --> 27:49.875
Really?

27:52.089 --> 27:55.292
I'm a psychopath, ain't
I? You and me both.

27:56.990 --> 27:58.513
What more do you need?

28:07.934 --> 28:09.539
I'm starving. Let's eat.

28:10.640 --> 28:12.126
You shot him!

28:12.140 --> 28:14.919
How was that for a pokey face, huh?

28:17.894 --> 28:19.797
It's poker face!

28:19.803 --> 28:22.203
I only have to know how
to do it, not say it.
