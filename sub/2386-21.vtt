00:02.928 --> 00:04.261
So, how's living alone?

00:04.477 --> 00:05.677
You know, it's interesting.

00:05.679 --> 00:07.812
When I first moved into
my new apartment,

00:07.814 --> 00:09.347
<i>I was nervous.</i>

00:09.349 --> 00:13.234
<i>For the first time in my adult</i>
<i>life, I didn't have a roommate.</i>

00:13.236 --> 00:14.903
<i>But then it hit me:</i>

00:14.905 --> 00:19.174
<i>for the first time in my adult</i>
<i>life, I didn't have a roommate!</i>

00:22.278 --> 00:25.229
<i>If I want to walk around naked,</i>
<i>nobody cares.</i>

00:25.231 --> 00:27.081
<i>If I want to leave</i>
<i>the laundry basket</i>

00:27.083 --> 00:31.119
<i>in the middle of the living</i>
<i>room, nobody stops me.</i>

00:31.121 --> 00:33.171
<i>If I bring home soup</i>
<i>from the deli</i>

00:33.173 --> 00:36.240
<i>and leave it in the fridge</i>
<i>for two days, nobody eats it.</i>

00:36.242 --> 00:39.177
<i>And if I do something</i>
<i>colossally stupid,</i>

00:39.179 --> 00:41.579
<i>nobody ever has to know.</i>

00:45.367 --> 00:46.885
People make fun of the guy

00:46.887 --> 00:49.304
who stays home every night
doing nothing.

00:49.306 --> 00:53.291
But the truth is...
that guy's a genius.

00:53.293 --> 00:56.594
<i>Because let's be honest,</i>
<i>sitting around watching TV,</i>

00:56.596 --> 00:59.430
<i>drinking beer and eating ribs</i>
<i>alone is what every</i>

00:59.432 --> 01:04.385
<i>red-blooded American would</i>
<i>rather be doing at all times.</i>

01:04.387 --> 01:08.072
Yeah, but wouldn't it be better
to have someone to share the...

01:08.074 --> 01:11.492
I mean, don't you
get lonely without...

01:11.494 --> 01:13.611
Yeah, that sounds pretty great.

01:26.458 --> 01:27.425
What's the best thing

01:27.427 --> 01:29.978
about dating a stripper,
you ask?

01:29.980 --> 01:30.962
Nope.

01:30.964 --> 01:32.463
Just asked for your drink order.

01:32.465 --> 01:34.182
I'll tell you the best thing
about dating a stripper.

01:34.184 --> 01:35.149
He'll just have a scotch.

01:35.151 --> 01:36.234
Getting to say,

01:36.236 --> 01:38.152
"Hey, I'm dating a stripper."

01:38.154 --> 01:39.654
And I should go.

01:39.656 --> 01:41.406
Time to make the doughnuts.

01:41.408 --> 01:44.192
More like time to make some
dough sitting on some nuts.

01:44.194 --> 01:45.276
She's a stripper.

01:45.278 --> 01:46.277
I'm dating her.

01:46.279 --> 01:47.495
I'm dating a stripper.
Barney wins.

01:47.497 --> 01:48.413
I'll walk you out.

01:48.415 --> 01:50.815
Hey, where are
you going?

01:50.817 --> 01:52.417
Quinn needs to get to work.
She's a...

01:52.419 --> 01:54.318
I know, a stripper, got it.

01:54.320 --> 01:55.920
Hey, taxi!

01:56.923 --> 01:59.123
My girlfriend's a stripper!

01:59.125 --> 02:02.493
So, Ted, guess where we're
having dinner Friday night.

02:03.095 --> 02:04.178
Chez L'Argent.

02:04.180 --> 02:05.596
I am so excited.

02:05.598 --> 02:07.632
We've been trying forever
to get this reservation.

02:07.634 --> 02:09.517
Can you hold on
for just one second?

02:09.519 --> 02:10.884
What the hell
are you doing?

02:10.887 --> 02:12.053
Nothing.

02:12.055 --> 02:13.972
Did you say
you had to pee?

02:13.974 --> 02:15.473
No.

02:15.475 --> 02:17.308
But yeah, I do have to pee.

02:17.310 --> 02:20.194
Man, this kid better be
real freakin' cute!

02:22.398 --> 02:23.898
What was that all about?

02:23.900 --> 02:25.867
Lily had a sex dream last night.

02:27.186 --> 02:28.653
Sex dream?
Do tell.

02:28.655 --> 02:32.189
I was painting
the baby furniture...

02:32.191 --> 02:35.910
Oh, yeah.

02:35.912 --> 02:39.130
Oh, yeah.

02:39.132 --> 02:41.582
Hurry up,
before Marshall gets home.

02:41.584 --> 02:43.751
Oh, oh...

02:47.556 --> 02:49.424
Whoa!

02:49.426 --> 02:50.425
I'm sorry, baby.

02:50.427 --> 02:51.993
Were you asleep?

02:51.995 --> 02:54.479
All pregnant ladies
have crazy sex dreams.

02:54.481 --> 02:57.265
It's just her hormones
going berserk.

02:57.267 --> 02:59.901
So who's responsible for her
rapid thigh movement this time?

02:59.903 --> 03:01.936
Oh, my favorite was when
she banged George Washington.

03:01.938 --> 03:05.389
I liked the three-way with
Bill Cosby and Papa Smurf.

03:05.391 --> 03:07.775
Oh, he smurfed
the smurf out of her.

03:07.777 --> 03:09.577
Yes, while The Cos
smurfed off in the corner.

03:09.579 --> 03:11.529
We all remember.
But here's the thing.

03:11.531 --> 03:14.899
When Lily has dirty dreams
about other people,

03:14.901 --> 03:16.617
she always tells me.

03:16.619 --> 03:17.935
But this time...

03:17.937 --> 03:21.923
Sounds like you
had a crazy dream.

03:21.925 --> 03:24.425
What was it about?

03:25.894 --> 03:30.014
And then her face turned...

03:30.016 --> 03:32.683
<i>vermilion.</i>

03:32.685 --> 03:37.088
Just... you and me...

03:37.090 --> 03:40.024
gettin' it on, monogamously.

03:40.993 --> 03:45.696
Monoga-me-oh-my.

03:45.698 --> 03:48.766
Not the rose quartz
of the slightly embarrassed,

03:48.768 --> 03:51.652
or the tomato red
of the mildly abashed,

03:51.654 --> 03:55.406
vermilion, the color
of carnal shame.

03:56.408 --> 03:59.460
Can only mean one thing:

03:59.462 --> 04:01.963
Lily dream-banged
someone we know.

04:01.965 --> 04:04.549
Okay, you caught me
vermilion-handed.

04:04.551 --> 04:07.969
The truth is, I've spent
the last five years

04:07.971 --> 04:10.671
trying to inception
your wife.

04:10.673 --> 04:12.757
That movie only came out
two years ago.

04:12.759 --> 04:14.809
What movie?

04:14.811 --> 04:16.761
You know who I bet it is?

04:16.762 --> 04:18.346
Robin.

04:18.348 --> 04:20.231
Already checked.

04:20.233 --> 04:21.682
<i>Lily and I paid her a visit</i>

04:21.684 --> 04:23.851
<i>at the new World Wide News</i>
<i>headquarters.</i>

04:23.853 --> 04:25.820
And I'm so excited,
because I've been trying months

04:25.822 --> 04:26.804
to get this reservation.

04:26.806 --> 04:28.189
Can you hold on
just one second?

04:28.191 --> 04:29.440
What the hell
are you doing?!

04:29.442 --> 04:30.525
Nothing.

04:30.527 --> 04:32.743
Nice photo.
Oh.

04:32.745 --> 04:34.779
Your passport
must be enormous.

04:34.781 --> 04:36.414
(chuckles)
Ugh.

04:36.416 --> 04:39.984
You know, for the record,
I didn't want this.

04:39.986 --> 04:42.286
Didn't want it,
did not approve it.

04:43.373 --> 04:44.839
It's super embarrassing.

04:44.841 --> 04:47.158
Hey, Merle.

04:47.160 --> 04:50.611
So, uh, do you guys
want to come up and see my desk?

04:50.613 --> 04:51.879
Yeah, why not?

04:51.881 --> 04:53.431
Come on.

04:53.433 --> 04:54.932
I.D.?

04:54.934 --> 04:56.834
Oh. Um, that is me.

04:58.221 --> 04:59.336
Ma'am, with all due respect,

04:59.338 --> 05:01.639
you're a wee bit older
than that hottie.

05:02.609 --> 05:03.858
For God sakes.

05:03.860 --> 05:07.311
You know, here I am,
on national TV every day,

05:07.313 --> 05:10.781
and still a guy who spends
his whole life sitting next to

05:10.783 --> 05:13.151
a giant picture of me
has no idea who I am.

05:13.153 --> 05:15.403
This isn't my whole life;
I'm in a band.

05:15.405 --> 05:16.671
And we're gonna make it.

05:16.673 --> 05:18.906
<i>And, kids, they did make it.</i>

05:18.908 --> 05:21.275
<i>But I'll get to that later.</i>

05:21.277 --> 05:24.045
<i>You know what, I'm probably not</i>
<i>going to get to that later.</i>

05:24.047 --> 05:27.715
<i>They had one song,</i>
<i>it didn't suck, the end.</i>

05:27.717 --> 05:30.251
You always said
it wasn't about being famous.

05:30.253 --> 05:32.703
You just want to do
solid journalism, right?

05:32.705 --> 05:34.305
Yeah, well...

05:34.307 --> 05:36.507
Of course I want
to be famous!

05:36.509 --> 05:37.875
In Canada, I was Robin Sparkles.

05:37.877 --> 05:39.060
I was a cabinhold name.

05:39.062 --> 05:40.161
But here?

05:40.163 --> 05:41.512
Don't need to see
your I.D., Merle.

05:41.514 --> 05:43.181
Everyone knows
who you are.

05:43.183 --> 05:44.482
You're Merle.

05:44.484 --> 05:46.484
He was in one skit
in the Christmas party!

05:47.854 --> 05:50.221
Uh, by the way,
how is Ted doing?

05:50.223 --> 05:52.006
<i>Kids, you remember</i>
<i>what happened.</i>

05:52.008 --> 05:54.108
<i>I declared my love,</i>
<i>she turned me down,</i>

05:54.110 --> 05:56.827
<i>we both moved out of</i>
<i>the apartment, and now...</i>

05:56.829 --> 05:59.363
I haven't talked to him
since we... stopped talking.

06:00.399 --> 06:02.533
He's pretty good.

06:02.535 --> 06:03.784
Pretty good?

06:03.786 --> 06:06.153
Last night, you ate
a box of Froot Loops

06:06.155 --> 06:07.255
in your tighty whities.

06:07.257 --> 06:10.258
No, I demolished
a box of Froot Loops,

06:10.260 --> 06:13.010
fully nude.

06:13.012 --> 06:15.429
Yeah, "pretty good" works.

06:16.581 --> 06:17.598
Hey, Barney.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.767
Hey, Lily.

06:23.222 --> 06:25.223
Do you know
what this is about?

06:25.225 --> 06:25.890
Uh-huh.

06:25.892 --> 06:27.108
Do I want to know?

06:27.809 --> 06:29.093
No, sorry, bro.

06:29.095 --> 06:30.311
Damn it!

06:30.313 --> 06:31.762
Okay, time
for my stuff.

06:31.764 --> 06:33.981
Guys, I was sitting
at home last night,

06:33.983 --> 06:36.617
and all of a sudden,
I had a piphany.

06:36.619 --> 06:37.985
And my piphany
was this...

06:37.987 --> 06:39.820
Actually, it's, uh,
it's "epiphany."

06:39.822 --> 06:42.456
No, Ted, this
is <i>the</i> piphany.

06:42.458 --> 06:43.824
And here it is:

06:43.826 --> 06:48.129
Make... every...
night... legendary.

06:48.131 --> 06:49.664
Guys, we've had

06:49.666 --> 06:51.415
some pretty
legendary nights.

06:51.417 --> 06:53.834
But we've also had some nights
that weren't so legendary.

06:53.836 --> 06:57.004
Lookin' at you, The Night Ted
Made Us All Watch <i>Norbit.</i>

06:57.006 --> 06:59.757
Eddie Murphy as a fat lady;
what's the problem?

06:59.759 --> 07:01.392
That was Eddie Murphy?

07:01.394 --> 07:03.394
The non-legendary
nights are done.

07:03.396 --> 07:06.480
From here on in, every
single night of our lives

07:06.482 --> 07:08.632
will be a night
we'll never forget.

07:08.634 --> 07:10.685
Starting tonight.

07:10.687 --> 07:14.638
Who's ready for the longest,
craziest adventure yet?!

07:15.825 --> 07:17.491
Good.

07:17.493 --> 07:19.977
The weak have been
weeded from our herd.

07:19.979 --> 07:21.862
You ready to rock
and roll, Ted?

07:21.864 --> 07:23.147
Yeah, I'm going home, too.

07:23.149 --> 07:24.715
I'm sensing some costumes
coming up here

07:24.717 --> 07:25.866
and I'd rather steer clear.

07:25.868 --> 07:28.235
Ted, 20 years from now,

07:28.237 --> 07:30.421
when you're all alone
and I'm President,

07:30.423 --> 07:31.539
you're not
gonna remember

07:31.541 --> 07:33.541
sitting around your
apartment doing nothing.

07:33.543 --> 07:35.843
What you will remember
is that tonight,

07:35.845 --> 07:38.245
this night...

07:38.247 --> 07:41.482
was The Night We Started
a Mariachi Band!

07:41.484 --> 07:43.351
<i>Uno, dos, tres, quatro!</i>

07:51.343 --> 07:52.843
Okay, you were right.

07:52.845 --> 07:54.028
Memorable night.

07:54.030 --> 07:56.180
That was nothing
compared to <i>mañana,</i> amigo.

07:56.182 --> 07:58.232
Because <i>mañana</i> is gonna be...

07:58.234 --> 08:00.684
The Night We Ate Everything
on the Menu!

08:03.306 --> 08:05.206
A really memorable night.

08:05.208 --> 08:06.357
But tomorrow night...

08:06.359 --> 08:09.477
Is The Night We Brought
a Horse into the Bar!

08:10.996 --> 08:12.963
Okay, but tomorrow...

08:12.965 --> 08:16.651
Is The Night We Bungee Jump
off the Statue of Liberty!

08:19.638 --> 08:21.305
Nope.

08:21.307 --> 08:23.507
<i>That night was the night</i>
<i>of Aunt Lily</i>

08:23.509 --> 08:25.259
<i>and Uncle Marshall's</i>
<i>fancy dinner.</i>

08:25.261 --> 08:28.379
Complete with a fancy limo ride.

08:28.381 --> 08:29.347
Surprise!

08:29.349 --> 08:30.514
Hello!

08:30.516 --> 08:33.167
Hi, Ranjit.

08:35.654 --> 08:37.855
No.

08:45.314 --> 08:47.399
Should I take the
West Side Highway?

08:47.401 --> 08:49.367
Why not, Ranjit?

08:49.369 --> 08:51.503
Don't you always just
take whatever you want,

08:51.505 --> 08:53.405
regardless of
anything but your own

08:53.407 --> 08:56.958
dirty, sick,
twisted appetites?

08:59.412 --> 09:02.497
I'll stay on Broadway.

09:03.799 --> 09:04.999
I.D.?

09:05.001 --> 09:07.302
For God's sakes, open your...

09:07.304 --> 09:09.421
Yeah, that's about right.

09:09.423 --> 09:11.056
I.D.?

09:11.058 --> 09:13.141
<i>Robin had finally</i>
<i>learned the lesson</i>

09:13.143 --> 09:15.226
<i>that nobody</i>
<i>gets famous overnight.</i>

09:15.228 --> 09:16.761
<i>But here's the crazy part:</i>

09:16.763 --> 09:18.796
<i>that night, she got famous.</i>

09:18.798 --> 09:19.964
Robin, there you are.

09:19.966 --> 09:21.299
Sandy Rivers!

09:21.301 --> 09:22.434
Star of the show.

09:22.436 --> 09:24.486
What it is, my man.
Yeah.

09:24.488 --> 09:26.154
Robin, I've got
something big for you,

09:26.156 --> 09:27.906
something huge.

09:27.908 --> 09:29.841
And I want you on it.

09:29.843 --> 09:32.977
Sandy, you were
<i>in</i> the harassment video.

09:32.979 --> 09:34.312
You were great in that,
by the way.

09:34.314 --> 09:35.313
Thanks, holmes.

09:35.315 --> 09:36.614
And I like the way

09:36.616 --> 09:38.583
your filthy little mind works,
Robin, but this is real.

09:38.585 --> 09:39.534
Big story's breaking.

09:39.536 --> 09:41.169
Are you afraid of helicopters?

09:41.171 --> 09:42.820
I love helicopters.

09:42.822 --> 09:45.340
What am I covering, a war?
Better!

09:45.342 --> 09:48.777
<i>World Wide News</i>
<i>brings you the world.</i>

09:48.779 --> 09:50.762
<i>And now Robin Scherbatsky</i>
<i>with traffic.</i>

09:52.448 --> 09:55.666
You don't want to go
bungee jumping, fine.

09:55.668 --> 09:58.669
Tonight's The Night
We Stole a Mummy

09:58.671 --> 10:01.106
from the Natural History Museum!

10:02.808 --> 10:04.342
Yeah, I'm not
doing that.

10:04.344 --> 10:08.780
Then get out your MetroCard,
Ted, because tonight's

10:08.782 --> 10:11.682
The Night We Partied
with the Mole People!

10:13.319 --> 10:16.020
Barney, I have a Stouffer's
lasagna for one in the freezer

10:16.022 --> 10:17.739
that is going to be
unforgettable.

10:17.741 --> 10:19.874
I have a <i>Sanford and Son</i>
on my DVR

10:19.876 --> 10:22.577
that I will take with me
to my grave.

10:22.579 --> 10:25.296
I don't need tonight to be
any more memorable than that.

10:25.298 --> 10:28.216
Okay, <i>Sanford and Son</i>
does sound good.

10:28.218 --> 10:32.053
But if I could just present
a counter argument...

10:34.507 --> 10:36.891
You're locked out, dummy!

10:36.893 --> 10:38.676
Damn it! Barney!

10:38.678 --> 10:40.711
Give me your phone;
I'm calling my super.

10:40.713 --> 10:43.214
The only person we're calling
is everyone we know,

10:43.216 --> 10:46.518
because tonight's The Night
We Tracked Down Phil Collins,

10:46.520 --> 10:49.220
Became Best Friends with Him,
and Talked Him into Reuniting

10:49.222 --> 10:51.573
with Peter Gabriel,
So Then We Got to Sing Backup

10:51.575 --> 10:54.476
On The New Genesis Album
and It Was Awesome!

10:55.561 --> 10:57.562
Fine, I'll use the
phone at the bar.

10:59.949 --> 11:02.784
Ranjit, would you please
put up the partition?

11:02.786 --> 11:05.787
Partition going up.

11:05.789 --> 11:07.905
You had a sex dream
about Ranjit!

11:07.907 --> 11:09.407
Hello.

11:09.409 --> 11:10.842
Ranjit!

11:10.844 --> 11:12.410
Sorry.

11:12.412 --> 11:14.412
Okay, yes, I did,

11:14.414 --> 11:17.131
but it didn't
mean anything.

11:17.133 --> 11:19.384
Okay, well, what
happened in this dream?

11:19.386 --> 11:20.751
And I want to
know everything.

11:20.753 --> 11:22.086
Every explicit detail.

11:22.088 --> 11:23.438
Don't leave out any...

11:23.440 --> 11:25.190
Damn it, Ranjit!

11:25.192 --> 11:27.192
Sorry.

11:28.561 --> 11:30.562
Marshall, it was a dream.

11:30.564 --> 11:31.946
Yeah, well, dreams
are just stuff

11:31.948 --> 11:34.232
that you subconsciously
want to happen.

11:34.234 --> 11:35.867
Why do you think
I'm constantly dreaming

11:35.869 --> 11:37.768
about Bigfoot playing
quarterback for the Vikings?

11:37.770 --> 11:41.039
Because you fall asleep
looking at a painting of it.

11:41.041 --> 11:42.540
It soothes me.

11:42.542 --> 11:44.909
Don't try to change the subject.

11:44.911 --> 11:46.828
You sleep-cheated.

11:46.830 --> 11:48.946
You've been
sleep-sleeping around,

11:48.948 --> 11:50.131
and I'm sick of it.

11:50.133 --> 11:51.583
You know,
I have half a mind

11:51.585 --> 11:53.635
to get out and let you
eat all by yourself.

11:53.637 --> 11:55.920
Should I pull over?

11:55.922 --> 11:57.121
Damn it, Ranjit!

11:57.123 --> 11:59.474
Yes, Ranjit.
Pull over.

11:59.476 --> 12:02.810
Pulling over.

12:02.812 --> 12:03.978
You watch, Ted.

12:03.980 --> 12:06.631
Tonight is going
to be legen--

12:06.633 --> 12:08.716
it's the night
we stole a camel...

12:10.336 --> 12:13.855
...which means it'll be
full of drama-- dary.

12:13.857 --> 12:15.823
Dromedary!

12:15.825 --> 12:19.410
I applaud your wordplay,
but your core premise is flawed.

12:19.412 --> 12:21.579
Every night
can't be legendary.

12:21.581 --> 12:25.116
If all nights are legendary,
no nights are legendary.

12:25.118 --> 12:28.403
See, Ted,
that attitude right there,

12:28.405 --> 12:30.104
that's why I'm in the lead.

12:30.106 --> 12:31.456
What do you mean, in the lead?

12:31.458 --> 12:33.324
I'm talking about
the game of life, Ted.

12:33.326 --> 12:34.459
Scoreboard.

12:34.461 --> 12:36.511
Better wardrobe:
75 points.

12:36.513 --> 12:39.047
Apartment on a higher floor:
90 points.

12:39.049 --> 12:41.733
Longer name: 110 points.

12:41.735 --> 12:43.801
Sorry. Did you just make up
this point system?

12:43.803 --> 12:46.070
Made up the point system:
114 points.

12:46.072 --> 12:48.172
And ten points to you
for pointing that out.

12:48.174 --> 12:49.507
Nice job, Ted.

12:49.509 --> 12:51.593
15 points to me
for being gracious enough

12:51.595 --> 12:52.961
to give you those ten points.

12:52.963 --> 12:54.195
But here's the point, Ted.

12:54.197 --> 12:55.363
Every time I go out

12:55.365 --> 12:56.581
and have an awesome night

12:56.583 --> 12:57.715
and you're not there,

12:57.717 --> 12:59.350
that's another 100 points
in my column.

12:59.352 --> 13:01.419
So yeah, I'm in the lead.

13:01.421 --> 13:04.205
Barney, the fact that I
can stay home for a night

13:04.207 --> 13:06.524
shows that I have inner peace

13:06.526 --> 13:08.576
and that I don't feel
the need to keep score.

13:08.578 --> 13:10.244
That's worth like
1,000 points right there,

13:10.246 --> 13:12.914
so at the very
least, we're tied.

13:12.916 --> 13:14.799
We're so not tied.

13:14.801 --> 13:16.234
Although you know
what is tied--

13:16.236 --> 13:18.503
the strap
of my girlfriend's bikini.

13:18.505 --> 13:20.505
Except when it's not,
'cause she's a stripper.

13:20.507 --> 13:22.206
One million points!
Game.

13:22.208 --> 13:23.641
Shh.

13:23.643 --> 13:24.726
It's over.

13:24.728 --> 13:26.694
It's done. It's done.

13:28.147 --> 13:30.047
So what do you do?

13:30.049 --> 13:31.382
You're kidding, right?

13:31.384 --> 13:33.184
I... I'm an on-air reporter.

13:33.186 --> 13:35.486
I just did a report
like five minutes ago.

13:35.488 --> 13:37.221
You sound frustrated.

13:37.223 --> 13:38.556
Yeah, I am.

13:38.558 --> 13:42.560
I'm busting my ass,
and as usual, no recognition.

13:42.562 --> 13:45.663
Robin, I've been
doing this a while,

13:45.665 --> 13:48.166
and if there's one thing
I've learned, it's flarm.

13:48.168 --> 13:50.284
What?
Flarm.

13:50.286 --> 13:52.236
Flarm, flarm, flarm.

13:52.238 --> 13:53.788
Blobbum.

13:53.790 --> 13:55.673
What is wrong with you?

13:55.675 --> 13:57.291
Are you having a stroke?

13:57.293 --> 13:59.076
<i>As a matter of fact, he was.</i>

13:59.078 --> 14:00.795
Oh! Hold on! Wait!

14:00.797 --> 14:02.196
<i>Meanwhile, Lily was in</i>

14:02.198 --> 14:04.382
<i>desperate need</i>
<i>of a female friend.</i>

14:04.384 --> 14:06.351
Lily, I have seen this
a million times.

14:06.353 --> 14:08.886
Guys go crazy when there's
a baby on the way.

14:08.888 --> 14:11.255
You should have seen the manager
when his wife got pregnant.

14:11.257 --> 14:14.892
After the second trimester,
he made her stop stripping.

14:14.894 --> 14:17.228
Yeah, you're right.

14:17.230 --> 14:18.780
Now I feel bad.

14:18.782 --> 14:20.264
Our big dinner's been ruined.

14:20.266 --> 14:22.784
Marshall's
probably crying right now.

14:22.786 --> 14:25.536
I had no idea that
food could be this delicious.

14:25.538 --> 14:28.606
Marshall, you are being crazy.

14:28.608 --> 14:30.608
No, no, I can handle it.

14:30.610 --> 14:31.942
If I sell my laptop,

14:31.944 --> 14:34.746
we can get seconds
on those squash blossoms.

14:34.748 --> 14:36.130
I mean about Lily.

14:36.132 --> 14:39.500
Well, you know,
she's being crazy, too.

14:39.502 --> 14:40.618
She's pregnant.

14:40.620 --> 14:42.053
She gets to be crazy.

14:42.055 --> 14:44.055
You have to be the sane one.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.890
So what, I don't get to be
crazy again

14:45.892 --> 14:47.124
until the baby comes?

14:47.126 --> 14:50.261
No. Then it's baby's turn
to be crazy.

14:50.263 --> 14:52.963
When do I get to be crazy again?

14:52.965 --> 14:54.465
Never.

14:59.405 --> 15:01.072
We are totally even.

15:01.074 --> 15:03.191
We absolutely are not even,
and here's why.

15:03.193 --> 15:04.742
I'll grant you
that if you include

15:04.744 --> 15:07.278
the 12 points
for designing the skyscraper,

15:07.280 --> 15:09.580
the 83 points for slapping five
with Tommy Lee

15:09.582 --> 15:12.633
and the 9,000 points
for banging Robin before me,

15:12.635 --> 15:15.303
our point totals
would be about neck and neck,

15:15.305 --> 15:17.205
but there's one thing
you're forgetting.

15:17.207 --> 15:18.456
The fact that I don't care?

15:18.458 --> 15:19.807
No.

15:19.809 --> 15:22.310
And you just lost five points
for sass.

15:22.312 --> 15:26.297
Do you remember a conversation
we had about three years ago?

15:26.299 --> 15:28.716
Barney, you're
the king.

15:28.718 --> 15:30.268
Nobody picks up chicks like you.

15:30.270 --> 15:31.519
You're handsome,

15:31.521 --> 15:33.354
debonair,

15:33.356 --> 15:35.440
everything I wish I could be.

15:35.442 --> 15:37.141
I'm starting to think
this never happened.

15:37.143 --> 15:39.160
Let you finish.

15:39.162 --> 15:41.679
You're smooth,
charismatic,

15:41.681 --> 15:42.647
"sauve."

15:42.649 --> 15:44.148
I think you mean "suave."

15:44.150 --> 15:45.383
Aha.

15:45.385 --> 15:47.535
So you do remember.

15:47.537 --> 15:48.820
But there's one thing

15:48.822 --> 15:51.689
even a master ladies' man
like you could never do,

15:51.691 --> 15:53.291
and if you could
ever do it,

15:53.293 --> 15:55.293
it would be worth 500 points.

15:55.295 --> 15:59.080
You have my attention,
my slightly shorter friend.

15:59.082 --> 16:00.665
Here's the challenge.

16:00.667 --> 16:04.819
Get a girl's phone number
while you're wearing a dress.

16:06.672 --> 16:09.390
Challenge...

16:09.392 --> 16:11.092
Accomplished.

16:11.094 --> 16:12.176
That's right.

16:12.178 --> 16:13.845
Last year,
I slapped on a dress,

16:13.847 --> 16:15.713
took a few laps
around this very bar,

16:15.715 --> 16:17.215
and I got this:

16:17.217 --> 16:19.884
the phone number
of one Stephanie McColgan.

16:19.886 --> 16:23.053
Later that night,
I took off my pantyhose,

16:23.055 --> 16:25.740
and gave her panties...
my hose.

16:25.742 --> 16:27.057
That's right, Ted.

16:27.059 --> 16:29.360
I am 500 points ahead.

16:29.362 --> 16:31.329
Until you can get
a girl's digits

16:31.331 --> 16:34.899
while wearing a dress,
you and I will never be even.

16:34.901 --> 16:36.834
You know what? The super's
probably waiting for me,

16:36.836 --> 16:38.619
and I just remembered
there's a spare key

16:38.621 --> 16:40.371
under the doormat, so good night.
Wait, wait.

16:40.373 --> 16:41.739
Ted, don't go.
Barney, I am leaving.

16:41.741 --> 16:43.875
I'm afraid this is just
one of those nights

16:43.877 --> 16:45.510
we're probably going to forget.

16:45.512 --> 16:47.378
I don't think so, dude. Look.

16:47.380 --> 16:48.963
If you're just joining us,
the World Wide News

16:48.965 --> 16:51.582
Eye in the Sky traffic chopper
is out of control over Manhattan

16:51.584 --> 16:53.651
and being piloted
by our own Robin Scherbatsky.

16:53.653 --> 16:55.853
This probably won't end well.

16:58.608 --> 17:01.066
<i>Kids, every now and then,</i>
<i>New York has a moment</i>

17:01.070 --> 17:03.187
<i>when every eye in the city</i>
<i>is watching the same thing.</i>

17:03.889 --> 17:06.289
<i>This was one of those moments.</i>

17:06.290 --> 17:09.142
<i>We all watched breathlessly</i>
<i>as the pilot on the ground</i>

17:09.144 --> 17:11.962
<i>told her what to do,</i>
<i>and against all odds,</i>

17:11.964 --> 17:15.632
<i>your Aunt Robin</i>
<i>landed that helicopter.</i>

17:17.051 --> 17:19.002
I did it.

17:19.887 --> 17:21.421
I did it!

17:28.996 --> 17:31.097
<i>The pilot survived</i>
<i>and made a full recovery.</i>

17:31.099 --> 17:32.465
<i>And Robin?</i>

17:32.467 --> 17:34.734
It's Robin Scherbatsky,
everybody!

17:36.938 --> 17:38.555
Thank you so much.

17:39.991 --> 17:42.575
Oh, okay...

17:42.577 --> 17:44.077
<i>Robin got famous.</i>

17:44.079 --> 17:46.129
<i>In the next few days,</i>
<i>she would...</i>

17:46.131 --> 17:47.831
<i>meet the mayor,</i>

17:47.833 --> 17:49.432
<i>go on</i> Letterman

17:49.434 --> 17:52.485
<i>and even have a deli sandwich</i>
<i>named after her.</i>

17:52.487 --> 17:54.704
<i>But most importantly,</i>
<i>that night,</i>

17:54.706 --> 17:56.489
<i>she got a call, text or e-mail</i>

17:56.491 --> 17:58.708
<i>from almost everyone</i>
<i>she'd ever met.</i>

17:58.710 --> 18:00.593
Hey, Marshall.

18:00.595 --> 18:02.495
Hey, Lil.

18:02.497 --> 18:04.497
Hey, Barney.

18:04.499 --> 18:06.933
Yes, I know
you're dating a stripper.

18:06.935 --> 18:08.301
Mm-hmm.

18:08.303 --> 18:09.803
Hey, Dad.

18:09.805 --> 18:12.305
You proud of your little girl?

18:14.892 --> 18:17.360
Okay, I'll keep trying.

18:17.362 --> 18:21.197
Babe, I think
I know why you had

18:21.199 --> 18:23.900
that sex dream about Ranjit.
Why?

18:23.902 --> 18:25.201
Think about it.

18:25.203 --> 18:27.203
The way he talks
about his kids.

18:27.205 --> 18:29.188
He's a wonderful father.

18:29.190 --> 18:32.826
Just like Papa Smurf,
Bill Cosby...

18:32.828 --> 18:35.662
George Washington,
the father of our country.

18:35.664 --> 18:38.665
You're attracted
to great dads.

18:38.667 --> 18:40.500
And that's why you love me.

18:40.502 --> 18:44.037
Because I'm going to be
the greatest dad ever.

18:44.039 --> 18:46.556
Sure, that must be it.

18:46.558 --> 18:49.208

18:53.214 --> 18:55.298

18:55.300 --> 18:57.550
Okay, Barney,
I got to go.

18:57.552 --> 18:58.568
What?

18:58.570 --> 18:59.686

19:06.778 --> 19:08.695
Dude, you got your wish.

19:08.697 --> 19:10.730
It's a night
we'll always remember.

19:10.732 --> 19:12.565
Why can't we just go home?

19:12.567 --> 19:14.200
I can't go home, Ted.
Why not?

19:14.202 --> 19:17.370
Because...
I'm dating a stripper.

19:17.372 --> 19:18.972
Yes, I've seen your bus ad.

19:18.974 --> 19:20.690
I get it.

19:20.692 --> 19:22.241
No, you don't.

Every night, between 9:00 p.m.

19:25.597 --> 19:27.213
I'm in hell.

19:27.215 --> 19:29.799
All I can think about
is what Quinn is doing

19:29.801 --> 19:33.019
and where she is doing it
and who she is doing it on.

19:33.021 --> 19:36.439
If I don't do something
to take my mind off of it...

19:38.926 --> 19:41.828
You're lucky that you can just
go sit around the house, Ted.

19:41.830 --> 19:43.947
I don't have that option.

19:43.949 --> 19:46.232
Wow.

19:46.234 --> 19:48.051
You're in love with this girl.

19:48.053 --> 19:50.353
I really am, Ted.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.689
I mean...

19:52.691 --> 19:55.542
she's a stripper.
